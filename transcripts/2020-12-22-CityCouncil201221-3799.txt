I'M EVEN MORE GRATEFUL AS SOMEONE WHO HAS LIVED IN ANN ARBOR FOR THE LAST 15 YEARS, WHO CAME TO THIS TOWN BECAUSE SAN OE INCLUSIVENESS THAT THE SOUND OFFERED FROM MANY OF THE OTHER OPTIONS OR PLACES THAT I COULD START A CAREER AND I HAVE ENJOYED MY TIME IN THE CITY SINCE THEN. IT'S AN INCLUSIVE NEIGHBORHOOD. AND LIKE OTHERS THAT HAVE SPOKE BEFORE ME, I AM NOT BIG BUSINESS. THIS HOUSE THAT WE HAVE, MY HUSBAND AND I OFFER IT TO OTHERS AS PART OF OUR CHRISTIANF THAT WE HELP OUR NEIGHBORS AND THAT HAS WHAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING FOR LAST YEAR. SO I WANT TO THANK THE MAYOR FOR BRINGING THIS ORDINANCE AMENDMENT, D-1 AND I'M HOPING THAT THE COUNCILMEMBERS WILL SUPPORT IT. WHAT DO I MEAN BY HELPING MY NEIGHBOR?

I DON'T THINK WE TOLD YOU THAT WE WERE HERE BECAUSE OUR 3-YEAR-OLD GRANDDAUGHTER WAS HAVING HEART SURGERY. IT HAS BEEN A BLESSING FOR US TO BE ABLE TO STAY CLOSE TO MY SON WHO LIVES ON KOCH AVENUE.

00:14:28.783: >> I HAD MY NAME IS MOLLY KLEINMAN. I LIVE IN WARD 4 AND I'M AT 1211 PACKARD, WHEN IS C-4 ON THE AGENDA TODAY. I'M CALLING FOR THE REZONING FROM PARKING TO FRINGE COMMERCIAL AND FOR THIS PROJECT IN GENERAL. THIS STRETCH OF PACKARD IS FULL OF MOSTLY EMPTY PARKING LOTS AND THEY WERE MOSTLY EMPTY EVEN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC. I WOULD RATHER HAVE MORE NEIGHBORS IN THIS STATION AND -- SPACE AND GIVE MORE PEOPLE TO LIVE IN M MY CONVENIENT, WELCOMG AND WALKABLE NEIGHBORHOOD. THE DEVELOPERS HAVE BEEN VERY ENGAGED WITH THE NEIGHBORING COMMUNITY. THEY HAVE A LOT OF IN-PERSON EVENTS IN THE BEFORE TIMES AND THEY HAVE BEEN HOLDING VIRTUAL EVENTS DURING THE PANDEMIC AND THEY HAVE BEEN RESPECTIVE TO FEEDBACK AND SUGGESTIONS FROM CURRENT RESIDENTS IN THE NEHOOD. THE DESIGN OF THIS NEW DEVELOPMENT IS REALLY THOUGHTFUL ABOUT THE WAY THAT IT FITS INTO THE SURROUNDING NEIGHBORHOOD. THEY HAVE MOVED THE PARKING TO THE BACK, AND THEY WOULD PUT ENTRANCES FOR THE PARKING ON THE SIDE STREET, WHICH WOULD REDUCE CONFLICT POINTS BETWEEN CARS AND THE PEOPLE WALKING AND BIKING ALONG PACKARD. SETTING IT UP THAT WAY WOULD IMPROVE SAFETY FOR EVERYONE WHO PASSES THROUGH THIS CORRIDOR. I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THE PROSPECT OF GROUND FLOOR RETAIL THAT'S MORE RELEVANT AND USEFUL FOR PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD. I ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO APPROVE THIS ROE ZONING AND I HOPE TO SEE MORE PROJECTS LIKE THIS FOR SOME OF PACKARD'S OTHER EMPTY PARKING LOTS IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU.

00:17:09.144: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING IN 274, YOU CAN UNMUTE YOURSELF. CALLER WITHUMBER 247, I BELIEVE IF YOU PRESS STAR SIX, YOU CAN UNMUTE YOURSELF.
00:17:25.660: >> I HAD THERE. HI. MY NAME IS JEAN LEVERCH AND I'M A RESIDENT OF THE FIFTH WARD AND I'M CALLING IN SUPPORT OF THE LOCKWOOD SENIOR HOUSING PROGRAM AT 2195 EAST ELLSWORTH AND I'M CALLING BECAUSE ANN ARBOR HAS AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS, AND THE FIRST ITERATION AFTER THIS PROJECT DID NOT WORK OUT AND I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE SAY YES TO THIS PROJECT AT THIS NEW LOCATION. I'M VERY EXCITED THAT THERE WILL BE 154 INDEPENDENT SENIOR APARTMENTS AND THAT I UNDERSTAND THAT 65 OF THOSE UNITS WILL BE DEDICATED AS AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR THE NEXT 99 YEARS. IN ORDER TO MEET THE NEEDS OF ANN ARBOR, WE NEED THOUSANDS OF ADDITIONAL UNITS OF HOUSING AND LOCKWOOD IS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN THAT DIRECTION. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TAKING MY CALL. NK Y A G EVENING. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS SUSAN BASKETT.
00:18:33.394: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING IN 221, YOU CAN SPEAK NOW IF YOU UNMUTE YOUR PHONE. CALLER 221? I BELIEVE IF YOU PRESS STAR SIX, YOU CAN UNMUTE YOUR PHONE. CALLER ENDING IN 221, MS. BASKETT, IF YOU UNMUTE YOUR PHONE. YOU CAN PRESS STAR SIX, YOU CAN UNMUTE.
00:19:31.819: >> HELLO?
00:19:32.153: >> Clerk Beaudry: YES, WE CAN HEAR YOU.
00:19:33.588: >> SORRY ABOUT THAT GLITCH. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. GOOD EVENING, MY NAME IS SUSAN BASKETT AND I COME BEFORE YOU TONIGHT AS A RESIDENT OF THE ANN ARBOR OAKS SUBDIVISION, A MEMBER OF THE SOUTHEAST COALITION OF ANN ARBOR. AND LIKE OURSELVES, OUR HOUSING UNITS ARE DIVERSE. WE ARE THE LAST AFFORDABLE PLACE FOR HOMEOWNERSHIP IN ANN ARBOR. I AM ONE OF THE COALITION NEIGHBORS WHO IS OPPOSING THE LOCKWOOD TWO PROPERTY -- PROJECT. LOCKWOOD TWO IS AGE OFIT INTRUSIVE PROJECT THAT PREYS ON THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THEY HELP TO GENEROUSLY OPERATE ON BUILDING ON AN ATTRACTIVE SITE WITHIN THE CITY LIMITS TO RENT THE REST OF THE UNITS AT A MUCH HIGHER COST AND BENEFIT FROM A TAX ABATEMENT WHEN THE ZONING CHANGE IS MADE TO A PUD. THERE'S THREE REASONS FOR MY OPPOSITION. NUMBER ONE, IT VIOLATES THE MASTER PLAN. ALLOWING A CHANGE OF THE ZONING FROM AN RC-1, WHICH SOME OF US FOUGHT MANY YEA FOR, TO A IT DEVELOPMENT WILL TAKE AWAY THE POSSIBITY OF WHAT IS FROM THE CURRENT MASTER PLAN, A GREATER BENEFIT TO THE COMMUNITY, A COMMUNAL SPACE LIKE A RESILIENCE HUB. THE STAFF REPORT RECOGNIZES THE ORIGINAL RECOMMENDATION OF THE MASTER PLAN BUT DISMISSES IT SAYING THAT CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE CHANGED OVER TIME. YES, THE BRYANT COMMUNITY CENTER HAS GROWN BUT. EXPANSION IS NOT LARGE ENOUGH TO ADEQUATELY SERVE THE CURRENT NEEDS. CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE PANDEMIC HAS SEVERELY CHANGED TO WARN ATE LARGER PLACE FOR SELF-SUFFICIENCY, DISASTER EDND COLLECTIVE SUPPORT. ALLOWING THE ZONING CHANGE SETS A PREDENT WHERE ADDITIONAL VIOLATIONS TO THE MASTER PLANS AND ERODES PUBLIC CONFIDENCE. TWO, BENEFITS TO THE IMMEDIATE COMMUNITY ARE NOT CLEAR AND CONVINCING. WE VALUE AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR EVERYONE IN THE CITY, BUT WHERE ARE THEENEFITS TO US WHO ARE MOST IMMEDIATELY IMPACTED WHICH JUSTIES THE ZONING CHANGE FROM AN RC1 TO A PUD WARK WHERE IS ERE ISHE BENEFITO THE COUNITY? WE HAVE SIDEWALKSTHE PROPOSED DE DAGE BEING CAUSED BY THE DEVELOPMENT,OT TO ASST WITH THE RRENT FLOODING ISSS WE HA. SCHOOLS GN NOTHING FROTHEPUBLIC NO DCUSSIONS AT THEOABEEN NAL O WITH STAFF ABOUT ANY POSSIBLE PARTNERSHIP OR COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE SCHOOLS OR THE FOR-PROFIT DEVELOPMENT. THE TAX ABATEMENT ALLOWED UNDER THE ZONING CHANGE WILL COST US AS TAXPAYERS, AGAIN WITH NO BENEFITS TO US. THIS IS A COMMERCIAL FOR-PROFIT TS NOTELONGGN NEIGHBORHOOD. IT DOES NOT ADDRESS THE LONG-TERM NEED OF AFFORDABLE HOUSE FOR LOW-INCOME EARNING WORKFORCE OR ITS RETIREES. A FEW UNITS PRESENTED ARE NOT FOREVER. AND WITH RENTS OF UP TO $1,100, THEY ARE NOT WITHIN THE REACH OF MOST OF OUR WORKING NEIGHBORS, LEAST OF ALL OUR SENIOR CITIZENS WITH AN AVERAGE SOCIAL SECURITY CHECK OF $1,400 PER MONTH. A FEW UNITS OFFERED BY PROFITABLE DEVELOPERS AT A GREATER COST TO US AS COMMUNITY RESIDENTS ARE NOT A VIABLE, LONG-TERM SOLUTION. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THIS EVENING.
00:22:42.677: >> Mayor TayloOU.R NEXT SPEAKER.
00:22:52.186: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING IN 347. CALLER 347, YOU CAN UNMUTE YOUR PHONE AND SPEAK.
00:23:04.365: >> HELLO, I'M ADAM OXNER, A WARD TWO RESIDENT AND AIM HERE TO TALK ABOUT CA-9 WHICH PROPOSED THE USE OF POLICE SURVEILLANCE, TWO C CAMERAS TO BED IN THE 28 VEHICLES IN THE FLEET. FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN PROVEN OVER AND OVER AGAIN TO BE BIASED AND USED MOSTLY TO SURVEIL LOWER-INCOME COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. IN SHORT, IT'S A POWERFUL TECHNOLOGY CAN AND HAS PROVEN TO HARM THE LESSER PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES. WHILE THIS SPECIFIC PURCHASE ORDER DOES NOT GRANT AXON, FORMERLY KNOWN AS TASER TO IDEN PERSON'S IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION, IT OFF-LOADS ALL IS SERVERS TO AGGREGATE. A SOMEWHAT CONCERNING PRACTICE FOR THE PRIVACY OF OUR CITIZENS. THIS TECHNOLOGY IS USED BY POLICE THAT WE NEED STRONG CITIZEN OVERSIGHT OF. I URGE COUNCIL TO GIVE THE POWER TO REVIEW AND RECOMMEND FOR OR REJECT ANY TECHNOLOGY PURCHASED BY THE POLICE DEPARTMENT. SUCH POWERS OF INDEPENDENT OVERSIGHT COMMUNITIES ARE BEING LEVERAGED ACROSS THE UNITED STATES TODAY IN PLACES LIKE OAKLAND AND PORTLAND, TO KEEP DANGEROUS TECHNOLOGY LIKE FACIA RECOGNITIONUT OF THE HANDS OFS WITH A P ABUSE IT. WE CAN JOIN OTHER CITIES LIKE BOSTON, BERKELEY, PORTLAND AND MORE TO BE A LEADER ON THIS ISSUE. LISTENERS CAN FIND EXAMPLE INFORMATION AND MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE POLICE OVERSIGHT AND FACIAL RECOGNITION AT ACLU.ORG OR EFF.ORG, TWO ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE DOING FANTASTIC WORK ON THE SUBJECT. THANKS FOR YOUR TIME.
00:24:47.535: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS ADAM GODMAN. MANY.
00:25:00.147: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING IN 442 YOU CAN UNMUTE YOURSELF. MR. GODMAN?
00:25:07.989: >> GOOD EVENING. MY NAME IS ADAM GOODMAN. I'M A RESIDENT OF THE FIFTH WARD AND SINCE THE COUNCIL RULES ARE ON THE AGENDA TONIGHT, I WANTED TO SPEAK A BIT ABOUT THE PUBLIC COMMENT PROCESS ITSELF. OVER THE YEARS I HAVE BEEN WATCHING COUNCIL MEETINGS MORE OFTEN THAN NOT, THESE MEETINGS HAVE INCLUDED SOME PUBLIC HATEFUL, ANTI-SEMITIC AND I HEARD VICIOUS PERSONAL ATTACKS MADE AGAINST THE MAYOR AND COUNCILMEMBERS, HOWEVER I HAVE NEVER SEEN THEM DRAW ANY RESPONSE OTHER THAN BASICALLY THE USUAL, THANK YOU, NEXT. AS MUCH AS I DISLIKED WHAT I HAVE HEARD, I HAVE COME TO UNDERSTAND THAT UNDER STATE LAW AND THE US CONSTITUTION THAT APPROACH IS CORRECT. SO I FIND IT QUITE DISTRUBBING THAT OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS, WHEN WE HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN HEARING SUBSTANTIVE, POINTED AND RELEVANT CONCERNS ABOUT THE CONDUCT OF COUNCILMEMBERS, SEVERAL SUGGESONSEEN MADE THAT WE S F WAYO ADD MO BARRIERS TO ENTRY TO PUBLIC PARTICIPATION, IN RESPONSE NOT TO THESE HATEFUL COMMENTS BUT TO THESE SUBSTANTIVE ONES. BETTER YET, THESE SUGGESTIONS COME FROM PEOPLE WHO IN OTHER CONTEXTS HAVE ENDORSED THE PRIMACY OF PUBLIC INPUT SEVERAL TIMES. IT SEEMS LIKE THEY ACTUALLY ONLY EVER WANTED TO HEAR THE PUBLIC INPUT THEY AGREED. WITH. SO FOR NOW, I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD CHANGE THE PUBLIC COMMENT PROCESS, UNTIL WE RETURN TO MOSTLY IN-PERSON MEETINGS I HOPE WE CAN CONTINUE TO ALLLLLL REMOTE PARTICIPATION. FOR SOME OF US, IT MAKES THINGS EASIER. I WANTED TO SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS ONE THE ISSUES THAT SPONSORED THIS CONVERSATION, THE FACT THAT COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER ADDED A SECOND STORY TO HIS HOUSE AFTER GOING THROUGH THE LEGALLY REQUIRED PERMITTING PROCESS. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER AND OTHERS ARE TRYING TO SPIN A NARRATIVE OF VICTIMHOOD WHICH IS RIDICULOUS.
00:26:56.731: >> Councilmember Griswold: OUT OF ORDER!
00:26:59.400: >> HE CHOSE TO ADD A SECOND STORY ON TO HIS HOUSE. IT'S NOT LIKE THIS JUST HAPPENS. THIS --E NOTO PULL PER FOR
00:27:06.073: >> Councilmember Griswold: CALL CA OF ORDER. CALL OF ORDER.
00:27:13.414: >> THE CANDIDATES OFTEN DO THAT SORT OF THING. IT'S OFTENTIMES GETTING YOUR HOUSE IN ORDER. AND FINALLY, CHOSE TO SPEAK AT LENGTH AT THE COUNCIL TABLE. THIS IS NOT THAT BIG OF A TOWN. PEOPLE WERE GOING TO NOTICE --
00:27:26.594: >> Councilmember Hayner: POINT OF ORDER. THIS IS NOT WHAT IS BEING ADDRESSED.
00:27:33.467: >> THAT DOES NOT MAKE IT OKAY FOR A COUNCILMEMBER TO DO SO. WE HAVE --
00:27:38.038: >> Clerk SECONDS.
00:27:39.940: >> WE EXPECT THEM TO FOLLOW THE SAME RULES. IF THEY ARE TOO ONEROUS, OKAY. GUESS WHO HAS THE POWER TO FIX IT. I'M NOT SURE WE SHOULD TAKE COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER'S STORY AT FACE VALUE BECAUSE THERE'S AN ALTERNATIVE, SAYING HE DEFRAUDED THEM OUT OF TENS OF THOUSANDS IN PROPERTY TAXES.
00:27:57.958: >> Councilmember Hayner: PLEASE, COUNCIL RULE 7.
00:28:00.327: >> GIVEN THE UNKNOWNS, I WON'T --
00:28:02.563: >> Councilmember Griswold: RULE 7.
00:28:03.597: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  ARE WE REALLY LISTING TO?

00:33:55.983: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OTHER COMMUNICATIONS TODAY FROM COUNCIL? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
00:34:04.925: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. JUST A QUICK APOLOGY TO THE PUBLIC AND TO, IN FACT, THE ONES WHO CALLED UP THE CITY CLERK THIS MORNING TO TRY TO SIGN UP TO SPEAK TO ISSUES THAT ARE ON OUR AGENDA. WE RECEIVED A LETTER FROM GLEN NELSON, AN ADVOCATE HERE IN OUR COMMUNITY FOR A VERY LONG TIME, WHO CALLED IN TODAY AT 8:02 A.M., AND COULD NOT GET ON THE LIST TO SPEAK. AND THERE ARE MANY OTHERS WHO SIGNED UP THIS MORNING TO SPEAK JA BECAUSE OF DC-1, ANDHEY GOT I'M SURE THEY WERE TIPPED OFF TO CALL. ANYHOW, WHAT AN AWFUL WAY TO START A MEETING, AND, YOU KNOW, WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME AND MONEY LAST WEEK AT A WORK SESSION TO TRY TO FIND WAYS TO WORK AND IMPROVE OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH ONE ANOTHER AND THE COMMUNITY AND, YOU KNOW, THAT -- THAT TENTH CALLER THERE, R DISRUPTS THE BUSINESSF RUNNING A CITY AND POLICY SETTING. I'M SORRY. IT'S JUST NOT HELPFUL. AND I'M GOING TO TRY TO GET MY HEAD BACK TOGETHER HERE AND SO I CAN START MAKING SOME GOOD DECISIONS FOR OUR CITY.
00:35:32.746: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
00:35:34.147: >> Councilmember Nelson: THANK YOU. I WOULD JUST LIKE TO COMMENT THAT WE HAD A PRETTY QUIET COUNCIL CAUCUS LAST NIGHT BECAUSE THERE WERE ONLY THREE OF US THERE AND I WANT TO EXTEND AND EXTRANVITATION INN TO WHAT COUNCILMEMBERRRD SENDS OUT EVERY WEEKEND INVITING ALL COUNCILMEMBERS TO JOIN US ON SUNDAY NIGHTS. IT REALLY IS HELPFUL TO GET THROUGH THE AGENDA AND TALK IT OUT AND GOOD ET CETERA MORE GETS AHEAD OF THESE MEETS SO THAT THEY ARE NOT QUITE AS LINE. WE HAD AN EXCITEMENT IN WARD 4 THIS WEEK BECAUSE SIGNAGE WENT UP AT GRADEN PARK. I TOOK A PICTURE TV AND IT WAS IN MY NEWSLETTER. I KNOW THAT THE LAURA BURNS PARK IS HAPPY TO HAVE THAT HONOR FOR OUR FORMER C, THTHTH OTHTH THI I WANTED TO SAY WAS I THINK A LOT OF US ARE STAYING HOME THIS BREAK, AND I'M -- I GOT A BIG STACK OF JIGSAW PUZZLES AT MY HOUSE. AND I PUT A GOOFY PUZZLE OF WARD FOUR. 57 LOCATIONS IN WARD FOUR. IF YOU KNOW WHERE THINGS UNDER WARD TWO FOUR ON MY WEBSITE, A2NELL.COM IT'S A BIT OF A CHALLENGE FOR THOSE OF US WHO ARE BIG CHEERLEADERS FOR WARD 4R HAYNER.
00:36:55.829: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES, THANKS. I WOULD LIKE TO REFER THE BODY TO -- WELL, ACTUALLY, IT'S FOR YOU, MR. MAYOR THAT COUNCIL RULE NUMBER 7, DISORDERLY CONDUCT PAT MEETINGS. THE CHAIR MAY CALL TO ORDER ANY PERSON WHO CALLS ON PERSONAL ATTACKS UNRELATED TO COUNCIL BUSINESS AND BECAUSE YOU DON'T SEE FIT TO DO THAT, THAT'S WHY I ASK FOR A POINT OF ORDER, BECAUSE IT IS A RULE AND I'M ASKING YOU TO ENFORCE THAT RULE. NOW, YOU ARE WELCOME TO SIT THERE AND HAVE OTHER CALLERS ENGAGE PNANRELATED COUNCIL BUSI. WE JUST DID TOO, BUT SEEING THAT YOU WERE NOT INTERESTED ON MY BEHALF OF MYSELF, I DIDN'T DO THE SAME TO SPEAK UP THE ALTERNATE SPEAKER ON YOUR BEHALF. IT'S CLEAR YOU ARE NOT INTERESTED IN ENFORCING THAT RULE AND I THINK SOME DEFERENCE COULD BE MADE TO CREATE SOME CIVILITY ON THE GODY IF YOU THAT --ON THE BODY. WHEN THEY SLANDER AND SPEAK TO THINGS THAT ARE NOT COUNCIL BUSINESS, T FABRICATE THINGS WHICH IS WHAT THAT CALLER DID, COMPLETE FABRICATIONS. YOU KNOW, IT'S MY RESPONSIBILITY TO CALL A POINT OF ORDER AND FOLLOW THE COUNCIL RULES AND I BELIEVE IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO DO SO TOO, ESPECIALLY IN THIS CASE, ESPECIALLY IF WE'RE TRYING TO HAVE A -- YOU KNOW, BUILD TRUST IN THE COMMUNITY MOVING FORWARD. SO I'M GOING TO ASK ONCE AGAIN THAT YOU CONSIDER READING THE COUNCIL RULES THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ASKED TO ADOPT TONIGHT AND THAT YOU BEGIN TO ENFORCE THEM.
00:38:32.092: >> Mayor Tay CILMEMBER DISCH.
00:38:35.195: >> Councilmember Disch: HI. I'M NOT IN MY USUAL SPACE. SO I'M A LITTLE NOT NORMAL.

AND SO PLANNING WILL BE FORWARDING T US A PLANROM ST. FRANCIS OF ASSISI CHURCH TO MAKE A TWO-STORY ADDITION TO ITS PARISH. OF THE WE'LL BE SEEING A REDEVELOPMENT OF A PARKING LOT AT 416 WEST HURON WHICH WILL PUT SOME STORM ROUTEING CONTROL AND LANDSCAPING CAN IS ALWAYS A GOOD THING. PLANING COMMISSION WILL BRING FORWARD RECOMMENDATIONS ON SITE PLAN -- SITE PLAN REVIEW STANDARDS AND ALSO THE REPORT ON A RECREW OF C1A AND C1A-R, THOSE WILL BE COMING FORWA THEYEYE. D THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION HAS BEEN SUPER ACTIVE THIS YEAR. EYILL BE SUBMITTING THEIR ANNUAL REPORT OF THE STATE OF THE ENVIRONMENT IN ANN ARBOR SOON. AND THEY WOULD ALSO LIKE US -- AND THIS WAS IN A MEMO THAT THEY SUBMITTED A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO ACTUALLY TO US, WHICH I GOT TO T TO MENTION THAT THEY WOULD LIKE US TO FURTHER ENHANCE THE FLOODWAY TO PREVENT BUILDINGS IN THE FLOOD FRINGE. THEY DON'T WANT THIS TO STOP THE FLOODWAY ORDINANCE FROM GOING FORWARD NOW, BUT THEY WOULD LIKR FAST. AND SO EVEN THAT FLOODWAY ORDINANCE WHICH IS EXCELLENT -- I KNOW FLOODIER IS NOT REALLY A WORD -- IT IS AN EXCELLENT ORDINANCE BUT IT COULD GO FURTHER TO PREVENT BUILDING IN THE FLOODWAY FRINGE. SO THANKS VERY MUCH.
00:40:31.778: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
00:40:36.650: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. JUST WANTED IN ADDITION -- FIRST, TO COLMEMBER RADINA, L THE DEVELOPMENT THAT'S HAPPENING THIS YEAR, IS HAPPENING IN THE THIRD WARD. SO WE HAVE HAD A GREAT CHANCE TO HEAR FROM LOTS OF OUR CONSTITUENTS AND I DO APPRECIATE ALL THE MESSAGES THAT WE HAVE BEEN GETTING IN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS, IN PARTICULAR. SO I WANT TO THANK PEOPLE FOR THAT. I ALSO WANT TO THANK PLANNING STAFF FOR TAKING THE TIME TO MEET WITH COUNCILMEMBER RADINA AND I TO SPECIFICALLY HAVE A REALLY GOOD CHAT ABOUT LOCKWOOD AND ANSWER A LOT OF THE , EVEN OFFS FIADING THIS EVENING. AND THERE'S SE ADDITIONAL ATTACHMENTS IN YOUR PACKET AS A RESULT OF THOSE DISCUSSION, PARTICULARLY AROUND THE VEGETATIVE BARRIER AND HAVING MORE DETAILS ABOUT THAT. SO THANK YOU TO STAFF FOR DOING THAT. THAT WAS TREMENDOUS. AND JUST AS A MEMBER OF THE CITY SCHOOLS COMMITTEE, AND BEFORE THIS NEW COUNCIL, I WAS THE ONLY COUNCIL REPRESENTATIVE AND I'M SURE COUNCILMEMBER SONG IS SUPER HAPPY GIVEN EVERYTHINGOING ON WITH THES TH THE SCHOOLS THAT SS HAPPY TO JOIN ME. AND I WANT TO RECOGNIZE ALL THE COMMUNICATION THAT WE HAVE BEEN GETTING ABOUT THE SCHOOLS AND IT'S GIVEN US A CHANCE TO REALLY THINK ABOUT WHAT OUR ROLE IS IN THE CITY, IN NOT DICTATING WHAT HAPPENS IN THE POLICY IN THE SCHOOLS BUT BEING SUPPORTIVE OF THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN THEIR EFFORT TO KEEP STUDENTS SAFE TO HELP OUR MOST VULNERABLE, TO GET ALL LY EXCELLENTHAT WEI THINK ARE HAVE BEEN HEARING ABO IN THE COMMUNITY AND WHEN IT'S SAFE TO DO SO FOR US AS A CITY TO STAND AT THE READY IN GETTING KIDS BACK TO SCHOOL SAFELY AND RETURN TO SCHOOL SAFELY, ESPECIALLY. THOSE WITH SPECIAL LEARNING NEEDS AND THE YOUNGEST MEMBERS IN THE COMMUNITY. SO I DO WANT TO THANK ALL OF THOSE IN THE COMMUNITY WHO REACHED OUT TO US. I HAVE HAD SOME REALLY TERRIFIC CONVERSATIONS WITH MEMBERS OF THE SCHOOL BOARD,ND IOOKSLIKEE G POTENTIALLY ANOTHER MEETING, EVEN THIS WEEK, ANDUST KNOW THAT OUR NEXT MEETING WE HEAR THAT WE MAY BE ABLE TO HELPFUL IN TERMS OF HOW WE CAN COMMUNICATE AND SHARE SOME OF OUR PRACTICES AROUND COMMUNICATION WITH THE SCHOOLS. SO OUR NEXT MEETING WILL REALLY BE FOCUSING ON WHAT WE'RE HEARING ABOUT? THE COMMUNITY AND HOW WE CAN GET RESPONSES AND BE GOOD PARTNERS WITH THE SCHOOLS IN THAT WAY. THANKS.
00:43:25.018: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCER BRIGGS. ouncil Brigg, THANKS. ARIEFPDATE FROM THE WE HE INFORTION ON HEALTHY STREETS IN OUR PACKET TONIGHT. THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION AT THE -- PASSES AI ARE E SOLUTION IN SUPPORT OF MOVING FORWARD WITH MORE PERMANENT INSTALLATIONS OF HEALTHY STREETS AT THE RECENT TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION MEETINGS. SO I DON'T THINK THAT'S BEEN FORWARDED ON TO COUNCIL YET, BUT WE SHOULD BE SEEING THAT COMING FORWARD SOON AS WELL. AND THEN I ALSO WANTED TO JUST TRANSITION VERY BRIEFLY, MAYBE IT'S MORE RELEVANT TO BRING UP AT THE END OF THE MEETING BUT I WOULD LIKE TO APOLOGIZE TO FIFTH WARD RESIDENT ADAM GOODMAN WHO WAS INTERRUPTED DURING PUBLIC COMMENT BY THREE OF OUR COUNCILMEMBERS. I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENCES OF OPINIONS AROUND WHAT RULE NUMBER 7 MEANS IN TERMS OF PERSONAL ATTACKS. I HAVE -- I UNDERSTAND FROM COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER'S PERSPECTIVE, HOW IT COULD BE UNCOMFORTABLE TO BEITTING THERE AND LISTENING TO SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE A PERSONAL ATTACK. I COULD NOT EVEN LISTEN TO THE COMMENTER. I -- I THINK IIS INAPPROPRIATE FOR UTZ U TO BE CSORING MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. I HEAR THIS BEFORE, I WASN COUNCIL AND I W LISTENINGN AND I CONTINUEDO HEAR MBERS OF THE PUBLIC CALL IN AND MAK MEMEERS OF COUNCIL ON POLICY ISSUES AND THAT MAY BE UNKOHL FOR THIBLE AT TIMES, BUT I HAVE NEVER HEARD THE MAYOR ASK THEM TO STOP, AND I THINKHAT IS -- THAT IS APPROPRIATE UNLESS WE SORTF -- WE MOVE INTO THE OBSCENE OR GROSSLY INDECENT LANGUAGE. SO OBVIOLY WEEED TO DISCU WHAT RULE NUMB 7 MEANS A LITTLE BIT MORE IN DTH SO WE VE SOME COMN UNDERSTANNG ABOUTHAT, BUT I WISHHAT SUE COULDAVE BEEN RAISED LAR IN THE MEETING.
00:45:34.180: >> May Taylor: COUNCMEMBER GRWOLD. . YE I WOULD LIKEO GE SOME CKGROUND INFMATI WHY SOME OFS AREUITE CCERNED WIT MEETGS. ALLOWED TO BE STATE AT AND I HE NOROBLEM WH POLICY DISCUSSN. I HAVE PROBLEMS WITH PERSONAL ATTACKS, WHICH ARE FALSE INFORMATION, THAT'S BEING CRAFTED BY A GROUP OF PEOPLE AND THAT'S BY BEING REPEATED OVER AND OVER AGAIN. IF YOU HEA A LIE 50 TIMES, YOU START TO BELIEVE IT. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TESTING HERE IN ANN ARBOR. IN JULY, FOLLOWING AN AMENDMENT TO THE A2ZERO PLAN, I NOT ONLY RECEIVED A DOZEN DEATH THREATS. I RECEIVED HUNDREDS OF ATTEMPTS TO HACK MY COMPUTER SYSTEM AT HOME. I AM NOW PAYING $300 EXTRA PER YEAR FOR A FIREWALL, BECAUSE THERE ARE PEOPLE IN MY HOUSEHOLD WHO ARENG FOR GOOGLE BRAIN AND THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AND WE MUST HAVE A SECURE NETWORK. NOW, THIS IS NOT JUST CASUAL COMMENTS THAT ARE ALLOWED TO SLIDE. THIS IS AN ORGANIZED EFFORT TO ATTACK AND I BELIEVE THAT IT IS MORE THAN JUST VIOLENCE WHEN YOU ARE GETTING DEATH THREATS ON THE PHONE AND WE AS A BODY NEED TO ADDRESS THAT.ON ANOTHER ISSUE, N MORE IMPORTANT TO ME, IS SAFETY OF OUR PEDESTRIANS. WE HAVE STREETLIGHTS THAT ARE OUT THROUGHOUT OUR COMMUNITY. IT IS BECOMING THE NORM. ON NOVEMBER 21st, A TICKET WAS PUT IN FOR STREETLIGHTS OUT ON STATE STREET NEAR THE US-23 BRIDGES -- I'M SORRY, I-94 BRIDGES. ANYONE WHO HAS DRIVEN THAT AREA IT IS FOR CYCLISTS ANDGEROUS PEDESTRIANS. THAT TICKET AND MULTIPLE TICKETS THAT WERE ADDED TO IT FOR THE SAME AREA, IT'S STILL OPEN. IT'S STILL DARK THERE. THAT IS JUST INEXCUSABLE. I WILL BE BRINGING FORWARD A RESOLUTION. I WILL WORK WITH THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR TO DETERMINE A WAY TO BE MORE PROACTIVE TOKER SURE THAT WE HAVE -- TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE LIGHTING. WE CAN HAVE LIGHTING THAT THAT DOES NOT HAVE POLLUTION AND CONSISTENT WITH THE DARK SKIES. AND WE NEED TO STEP UP AND ACTUALLY MAKE OUR COMMUNITY SAFE FOR PEDESTRIANS. I FOR ONE AM TIRED OF PLANNING FOR SAFETY, BUT NOT ACTUALLY ACHIEVING IT, AS IS REFLECTED NO OUR CRASH DATA. SO I LOOK FORWARD TO THIS. THANK YOU.
00:48:24.784: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER SONG.
00:48:28.054: >> Councilmember Song: I JUST WANT TO SHARE A LITTLE BIT FROM OUR POLICY ACTION COMMITTEE MEET LAST WEEK, WHERE COUNCILMEMBER EYER GLADLY ACCEPTED MY NOMINATION FOR HER TO BE CHAIR. SO BETWEEN MYSELF, COUNCILMEMBER EYER, AND COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD, WE HAD A REALLY GOOD CONVERSATION ON UPCOMING POLICY PRIORITIES AND HOW THAT'S CRAFTED. SO WE WILL BE REVISITING ALL THE COMMISSIONS AND ASKING FOR INPUT AND HOW YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE OUR PARTIES CHANGE OR STAY THE SAME AND THEN I PUT IN A REQUEST -- IT WAS A QUICK ONE AND I THANK COUNCIL FOR BEING PATIENT ON THIS LAST-MINUTE ADDITION IN ENDORSING THE -- THE HB-241, THE WATER SHED PROTECTION ACT THAT CAME THROUGH THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE. BUT IN THE NEW YEAR, WE'LL HAVE MUCH MORE WARNING AND I THINK A LONGER LIST. I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN HAVE DISCUSSIONS OF CLEAN SLATE ACTION, AMONG OTHERS. SO EVEN THOUGH JEN IS IN CHARGE, I THINK ALLEE OF US ARE OPEN TO IDEAS AND SUGGESTIONS. SO PLEASE BE JUDGES. THANKS.
00:49:44.997: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
00:49:45.865: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I WILL TRY TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE LEVEL HEADED WITH THE SECOND COMMENT I WILL MAKE IN RESPONSE TO WHAT MY COUNTERPART IN THE FIFTH WARD, COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS. IN RESPONSE TO YOUR COMMENTS, I WILL JUST ASK THAT,E ALLOW FOR THE COUNCIL PERSON WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WORDS OR THE ACTIONS TO APOLOGIZE FOR THOSE WORDS OR ACTIONS. I DON'T KNOW IF I'M GOING TO BE AROUND TO APOLOGIZE FOR THE WORDS AND ACTIONS OF ALL OTHER COLLEAGUES HERE. I JUST DON'T KNOW IF -- I -- IT JUST SEEMS A LITTLE ODD TO ME. I THINK YOU SHOULD, PERHAPS ALLOW THAT INDIVIDUAL TO MAKE THAT APOLOGY FOR THEMSELVES. I THINK THAT -- I MEAN WE COULD PROBABLY TALK ABOUT THAT OFFLINE. I DON'T WANT TO WASTE THIS BODY'S TIME MORE THAN I HAVE ALREADY. BUT I WILL SAY THAT I SPENT QUITE A BIT OF TIME AND EFFORT AND SACRIFICE IN SERVING MY COMMUNITY AND I GLADFULLY DO SO. AND I JUST ASK THAT MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC RESPECT SO THAT OUR EFFORTS AND TIME AND DEDICATION ISN'T WASTED, AND IT'S APPRECIATED AND WHEN THEY CALL IN, THEY CAN JUST MAKE THOSE EFFORTS EVEN MORE MEANINGFUL. AND I DON'T THINK THAT WAS THE CASE EARLIER. SO I WILL LEAVE IT THERE FOR NOW.

00:58:46.705: >> Councilmember Eyer: THANK YOU. I JUST WANTED TO MAKE THE SIMPLE POINT THAT WE HAVE A PROCESS FOR PUTTING QUESTIONS IN AHEAD OF TIME, QUESTIONS RELATING TO THE MINUTE DETAILS OF HOW THINGS LIKE THIS WORK, AND I WOULD HOPE THAT COUNCILMEMBERS AVAIL THEMSELVES OF IT SO WE ARE NOT SPENDING HOURS ASKING REALLY MUNDANE QUESTIONS OF STAFF DURING A COUNCIL MEETING. THANK YOU.

00:59:20.472: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I DON'T FIND THOSE QUESTIONS TO BE MUNDANE AND AT TIMES THOUGHTS COME TO ME AFTER AND I WOULD STILL LIKE ANSWERS TO THEM.

SO APOLOGIZE, BUT I WILL STILL CONTINUE TO HAVE QUESTIONS EVEN AFTER SUBMITTING QUESTIONS AS I DID THIS AGENDA. I SUBMITTED MY QUESTIONS. AND I STILL SOMETIMES HAVE MORE.

MOVED AND SECONDED. DISCUSSION OF CA-13. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:00:37.549: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, MAYOR. I KNOW THIS IS KIND OF A TOUCHY SUBJECT BECAUSE OF THE CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT BEING BROUGHT FORTH AND THE SENSITIVITY AROUND DISCUSSIONS. SO I WILL BE LIMITED TO ASKING WHAT I REALLY WOULD LIKE TO ASK. AND I GUESS MY QUESTION IS -- OR QUESTIONS, WITH THIS INSTANCE, WE BEGAN THIS RELATIONSHIP WITH THIS LAW FIRM AND WE HAD MANY RELATIONSHIPS WITH THIS LAW FIRM PRIOR TO THIS ONE, BUT THIS PARTICULAR CASE, STARTED WITH A SIMPLE $25,000 CONTRACT. AND THEN IT COMES BACK TO COUNCIL FOR SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER TOTALS FOR APPROVAL. AND WE ARE AT THAT VERY IMPORTANT PART OF THE PROCESS WHERE THAT FIRST AMENDMENT FOR THAT BIG CONTRACT BEGINS. AND I JUST HAVE SEEN THIS ONCE BEFORE, WITH THE GELMAN LITIGATION, AND NEGOTIATIONS, AND NOW WITH THIS. AND I'MT CURIOUS ON WHEN WHEN THIS BODY WILL MEET AS IN CLOSED SESSION TO DISCUSS THE SENSITIVE NATURE SURROUNDING THIS CASE SO WE CAN HAVE MORE COMFORT IN THE APPROVAL OF THE FUNDS AND THE WORK AND THE STRATEGY ASSOCIATED IN DEFENDING THIS CASE.
01:02:14.446: >> City Atty. Postema: WELL, COUNCILMEMBER, WE CAN HAVE A ANY TIME.N PENDING LITIGATION AT AND SO THAT'S CERTAINLY APPROPRIATE. YOU HAVE GOTTEN -- WE HAVE HAD A CLOSED SESSION ON THIS CASE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CASE AND WE CAN HAVE IT AT ANY TIME DURING THE CASE. AND SO, YOU KNOW, THAT'S CERTAINLY APPROPRIATE AND IF YOU WOULD LIKE ONE, I COULD SCHEDULE A SPECIAL SESSION, PARTICULAR ON THAT. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE ISSUE OF THE FEES IN THE CASE AND THE CASE IS GOING FORWARD. IT'S ONGOING LITIGATION, THAT CERTAINLY HAS BEEN KNOWN AND THE AMOUNT OF -- YOU KNOW, THE TYPE OF FEES THAT WOULD -- A CASE LIKE THIS WOULD COST. SO WE CAN GO IN RIGHT NOW, IF YOU WANTED TO, IF THERE WERE THINGS THAT WERE APPROPRIATE, WITH HE WECOULD GO IN LATER TON. IN ANY CASE, THE CASE IS ONGOING. SO I'M NOT SURE -- YOU COULD VOTE ON THE CONTRACT AND THEN GO INTO CLOSED SESSION TONIGHT, ALTHOUGH I WOULD RECOMMEND A SPECIAL SESSION ON IT, SO THAT YOU COULD FOCUS ON IT. I WILL TELL YOU THERE'S NOTHING DIFFERENT IN ONE SENSE THAN YOU HAVE ALREADY BEEN ADVISED OF, BUT IN ANY CASE, WE ARE ALWAYS WELCOME TO TALK ABOUT IT AND WE CAN GO IN TONIGHT.
01:03:44.536: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  IT WOULD BE MY PREFERENCE -- AND I KNOW IT'S NOT GOING TO BE THE PREFERENCE OF SOME ON THIS BODY, TO GO IO CLOSED SESSION TO UNDERSTAND THIS BEFORE I SPEND $200,000 ON IT. WHAT DIRECTION IS IT GOING? WHAT ARE WE DOING? AND, YOU KNOW, I HAVE OTHER QUESTIONS THAT I THINK ARE MORE SENSITIVE THAT, YOU KNOW, I WOULD BE MORE COMFORTABLE ASKING IN A CLOSED SESSION.
01:04:09.695: >> City Atty. Postema: I THINK I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT ANYTHING RELATED TO THE LITIGATION BE DISCUSSED IN CLOSED SESSION.
01:04:18.904: >> Mayor Taylor: OR PERHAPS I MAY SUGGEST SEPARATE CONVERSATION WITH THE ATTORNEY'S OFFICE AMONG COUNCILMEMBERS WHO HAVE A PARTICULAR INTEREST IN ENGAGING IN THIS POINT AT THIS TIME.
01:04:26.979: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: WELL, THERE'S A QUESTION I WOULD LIKE TO ASK THE ATTORNEYS THAT REQUIRE ANOTHER SET OF, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE AND SO IT JUST -- IT JUST WOULD FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE TO APPROVE THIS AFTER WE HAVE HAD A CLOSED SESSION TO DISCUSS IT. I THINK THAT WOULD BE THE APPROPRIATE MEASURE TO TAKE.
01:04:54.172: >> City Atty. Postema: IF THAT'S THE CASE, I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT YOU GO INTO CLOSED SESSION NOW OR THAT YOU MOVE THIS UNTIL AFTER THE CLOSED SESSION OR HAVE A CLOSED SESSION EARLIER. IT DOESN'T HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THE VERY END. BUT YOU COULD PUT IT AT A LATER TIME. THAT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT YOU COULD DO BY AMENDING THE AGENDA TO DO THIS. TO GO INTO CLOSED SESSION AND TO AMEND THE AGENDA -- EXCUSE ME -- CERTAINLY TO GO INTO CLOSED SESSION AND TO MOVE THAT, IT REQUIRES -- I WILL CHECK THE VOTES ON THAT, BUT I BELIEVE IT'S EIGHT VOTES.
01:05:31.843: >> Mayor Taylor: EIGHT VOTES.
01:05:34.146: >> City Atty. Postema: YOU WOULD NEED TO HAVE EIGHT VOTES TO GO INTO CLOSED SESSION. AND ANY TIME ANYONE WANTS TO GO INTO CLOSED SESSION, WE ARE AVAILABLE TO GO IN.
01:05:43.355: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: WELL, I MAKE A MOTION TO GO INTO CLOSED SESSION --
01:05:49.628: >> City Atty. Postema: I WOULD -- WE WOULD NEED TO SET UP -- I WOULD ASK T SET UP A SEPARATE --
01:05:54.032: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  WE CAN MOVE THIS AND PUT IT LATER IN THE AGENDA. I WILL LEAVE IT TO THE MAYOR.
01:05:59.404: >> Mayor Taylor: WHY DON'T -- AS A MATTER OF PROCESS, PERHAPS THE BEST -- MR. POSTEMA, CAN WE -- IS THERE ANY REASON WHY THIS COULDN'T BE POSTPONED UNTIL OUR NEXT MEETING?
01:06:14.386: >> City Atty. Postema: OTHER THAN WE'RE DOING LITIGATION ON THIS AND SO WE'RE MOVING FORWARD --
01:06:18.924: >> Mayor Taylor: IF THE ANSWER IS NO, THEN THE ANSWER IS NO. THAT'S O
01:06:23.361: >> Clerk Beaudry: STEVEN, I CAN'T SET UP YOUR CLOSED SESSION. I CAN ONLY HOST ONE ZOOM SESSION AT A TIME. YOU HAVE TO HAVE A CITY ATTORNEY SET IT UP.
01:06:31.236: >> City Atty. Postema: IF WE MOVE THAT OVER, WE CAN SET UP A ZOOM SESSION FOR LATER THIS EVENING. WE COULD SET THAT UP. ALTHOUGH, THE -- I'M HAPPY TO DO THAT.
01:06:47.452: >> Mayor Taylor: LET'S CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION IF THERE'S ANYTHING AND THEN WE'LL FIGURE OUT WHAT WE WILL DO WITH THIS AS A MATTER OF PROCEDURE. IS THAT ALL RIGHT, COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
01:06:54.693: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES. THANK YOU FOR THE TIME.
01:06:57.863: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
01:06:58.730: >> Councilmember Hayner:  MY ONLY COMMENTS ARE THIS, THAT I UNDERSTAND THAT COMPLEX CASES LIKE THIS REQUIRE -- YOU KNOW, I RECOGNIZE THE NEED FOR SPECIALISTS IN A COMPLEX CASE LIKE THIS, HOWEVER, I'M ALSO -- I'M BALANCING THAT AGAINST MY GENERAL CONCERNS ABOUT THE CASE THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE ADDRESSED IN A CLOSED SESSION AND ALSO THE FACT THAT WE WERE TOLD TO SHAVE $9 MILLION OFF OUR BUDGET LAST MONDAY. AND SO I JUST -- YOU KNOW, THE ONLY REASON I WAS HAPPY TO SEE THIS PULLED IS BECAUSE A TASK BECAUSE I WON'T SUPPORT IT. THANK YOU.
01:07:47.712: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF CA-13? PERHAPS WE POSTPONE DISCUSSION OF THIS UNTIL THE END OF E MEETING AND THEN --
01:07:59.691: >> Councilmember Nelson: EXCUSE ME, SHOULD WE AMEND THE AGENDA THEN?
01:08:04.896: >> Mayor Taylor: YES, I'M FIGURING OUT WHAT THE END OF THE MEETING IS.
01:08:12.003: >> Clerk Beaudry: MAYOR, I THINK YOU CAN TABLE IT AND TAKE IT OFF THE TABLE LATER.
01:08:17.309: >> City Atty. Postema: THAT'S FINE.
01:08:19.177: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. POSTEMA, THAT'S REASONABLE TO YOU FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE.
01:08:28.920: >> City Atty. Poema: OR MOVE IT WITHIN THE AGEND
01:08:32.791: >> Mayor Taylor: LET US -- I GUESS I WOULD RATHER KEEP IT ON THE AGENDA RATHER THANABLING IT AND LET ME SUGGEST THAT WE MOVE IT AFTER COMMUCATIONS FR COUOUNSEL; IS THAT ALL RIGHT MAY I HAVE MOTION TO OPEN THE AGENDA?

01:09:06.191: >> Couilmember Ramlawi: IT'S CA-13, MAYOR. Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU VER MUCH. I APECIATE THAT. CA-13. City Atty. stema: IF YOU MOVE ITEFORE THE CLOSED SESSN, ITOESN'T -- IT ESN'T HELP WITH THE PPOSE I WOULD ROMMENDERHAPSOVING THE CLOSED SSION TO ANARLI ME.
01:09:26.811: >> Mayor Taylo LET'S ME IT TER THELOSED SESSI. MOVE-- WE HADOVED CA-, THANK YO COUNCILMEMBER TO AFR THE CLOSED SESSION. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER NELSON, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER RADINA. DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? THE AGENDA IS AMENDED SO THAT CA-13 IS MOVED AFTER YOU ARE CLOSED SESSION. THAT PUTS US TO CA-11. CA-11, RESOLUTION TO ADOPT THE BOARD OF REVIEW GUIDELILINES FOR POVERTY EX. IONS FROM PROPERTY TAXATION OF PRINCIPAL RESIDENCE PURSUANT TO MCL 211.7U, MOVED BY HAYNER AND SECONDED BY MS. SONG.
01:10:27.906: >> Councilmember Hayner: MS. GILOTTI IS AVAILABLE ON THE OTHER LINE. SHE WEIGHED IN FROM SOME OF THIS ON HER VANTAGE POINT AT THE COUNTY AND OECD. THIS IS ONE OF THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE HAD BEFORE US AS A BODY, TO REACH OUT AND EXPAND THE ABILITY TO KEEP LOW-INCOME FOLKS IN THE CITY. AND I SAW IN THE REPORT THAT IT'S NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE. IT'S SEVEN PEOPLE, I THINK MY FIRST YEAR, NINE PEOPLE, 11 PEOPLE, 13 HOUSEHOLDS AND SO ON AND I THINK THERE'S VARIOUS REASONS FOR THAT, SOME OF WHICH WERE DESCRIBED QUITE WELL BY SOME OF OUR CONSTITUENTS IN REACHING OUT TO US JUST PRIOR TO THIS MEETING. IS IT WELL ADVERTISED? IS IT EASY TO UNDERSTAND HOW IT WORKS? WHAT WOULD HAPPEN? AND THIS IS NOT FIRST TIME I HAVE ASKED THIS QUESTION OF MR. CRAWFORD? WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF WE EXPANDED THE -- THE VARIOUS ATTRIBUTES THAT A HOUSEHOLD WOULD HAVE TO HAVE FOR THIS? AND WHAT WOULD THE EFFECT BE ON OUR REVENUE STREAM?AND SO I JUSD THAT THIS IS HERE. I'M GLAD THAT IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE DO, BUT I FEEL THAT THERE'S ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT, EVEN IN WHAT SITS BEFORE US AND SO I JUST WANTED TO BRING THAT FORWARD TO THE BODY AND SEE IF ANYBODY HAD ANY INTEREST IN EITHER SETTING THIS ASIDE FOR A WEEK UNTIL WE CAN GET SOME IMPROVEMENT WRITTEN INTO IT OR MODIFYING IT, BECAUSE WHILE IT'S IMPORTANT, I DON'T THINK IT DOES ENOUGH AND I THINK IT'S ONE OF OUR FEW LAWFUL OPPORTUNITIES TO, YOU KNOW, CUT PEOPLE A BREAK, IF IT'S NECESSARY. I DO APPRECIATE SEEING THE INCREASE IN THE ASSET TEST, BUT I DON'T THINK WE HAVE GONE FAR ENOUGH WITH THIS. SO I WILL JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT FOR NOW.
01:12:08.540: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER SONG?
01:12:13.111: >> Councilmember Song: COUNCILME COUNCILMEMBER RADINA ARE ON THEB COMMISSION AND WE WON'T HAVE OUR FIRST MEETING UNTIL JANUARY. SO I THINK IT'S PROBABLY A GOOD IDEA TO SEE IF WE CAN JUST -- IF WE CAN'T DELAY THIS UNTIL THE COMMITTEE MEETS. AND I'M ALSOEW APPOINTED TO THE COUNTY'S COMMUNITY ACTION BOARD. SO I WILL BE ABLE TO WORK DIRECTLY WITH MS. GILOTTI TOO AND GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE BIGGER PLANS ARE FOR THE COUNTY IN THE WAKE OF THE PANDEMIC. SO I'M HOPING -- I THINK INSTEAD OF A WEEK, WE MIGHT HAVE TO BE THINKING ABOUT ANOTHER MONTH, BUT MAYBE STAFF CAN GOODIVE US SOME INPUT AS TO HELPING US WEIGH THE PROS AND CONS OF THAT.
01:13:01.626: >> Mayor Taylor: PERHAPS, IF THERE ARE CHANGES TO BE MADE, THAT WE CONSIDER -- IF THERE'S NO OBJECTION TO WHAT WE HAVE HERE TODAY, THAT IF IT'S SUITABLE TO ACCEPT WHAT WE HAVE NOW AND THEN MAKE CHANGES DOWNSTREAM, THAT'S A PROCESS THAT WE COULD ALSO ADOPT. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER? PARDON ME, COU COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:13:23.414: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I GUESS SINCE WE HAVE STAFF HERE TO HELP EXPLAIN THIS TO US, IF WE WANTED TO RAISE, LET'S SAY, THE INCOM LIMITS, THE 2.2 TIMES THE FEDERAL POVERTY RATE, WHAT DOES THAT DO? THAT'S ULTIMATELY WHAT MANY ON THIS ISSUE WOULD LIKE TO DO. WHAT DOES THAT DO FOR STAFF AND IMPLEMENTATION AND SO ON AND SO FORTH, TIME-WISE IF YOU CAN HELP EXPLAIN THE IMPACT OF ANY DELAY ON THIS TONIGHT.
01:13:58.883: >> City Admin. Crawford: MAYOR, I THINK MR. MARKEY,RY ASSESSOR MAY BE THE APPROPRIATE PERSON FOR THAT. R>> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANKS, TOM.
01:14:08.526: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
01:14:09.861: >> THANK YOU, MAYOR AND COUNCIL FOR THE WAITING UNTIL JANUARY 15th OR BEYOND THE MEETING OF THE HHSAB, THAT WOULD BE NO PROBLEM WITH OUR OFFICE TO IMPLEMENT THE POVERTY GUIDELINES AT THAT TIME. SECONDLY, INCREASING THE THRESHOLD TO 2.2 TIMES THE FEDERAL GUIDELINES, WOULD INCREASE THE POVERTY LEVEL TO APPROXIMATELY $28,000, I WOULD GATHER FROM WHAT IT CURRENTLY IS. AND HOW THAT WOULD AFFECT THE NUMBER OF APPLICANTS, I'M NOT SURE. THIS YEAR WE HAD 88 APPLICANTS APPLY BECAUSE IT WAS ADVERTISED THROUGH THE JULY TAX BILLS. A YEAR AGOW AGO, WE HAD 66 APPLS APPLY. THE BOARD REVIEW GRANTED APPROXIMATELY 80% OF THOSE APPLICANTS THAT DID APPLY. THOSE THAT DID NOT QUALIFY WERE DENIED MOSTLY BECAUSE THEY EXCEEDED THE ASSET TEST BEYOND A REASONABLE LIMIT AND THE BOARD OF REVIEW FOLLOWING THE CURRENT DIRECTION OF THE COUNCIL IN THE POVERTY GUIDELINES THAT WERE ESTABLISHED AND DENIED THOSE CANDIDATES, THOSE APPLICANTS. MAG MAYOR, IF I MIGHT ALSO ADD. YOU KNOW, THIS -- SOME OF THE CONCERNS RAISED ABOUT GETTING THE WORD OUT WERE RAISED LAST YEAR, AND SO STAFF HAS DONE A NUMBER OF ITEMS TO -- TO TRY TO GET THAT WORD OUT. THEY DID IT LAST YEAR AND THAT FOLLOWED THROUGH THIS YEAR. AND MS. GILOTTI MAY BE ABLE TO SPEAK. IF ANYONE HAS ANY CHALLENGES ON THEIR TAXES, COUNTYWIDE, THEY CAN HIT THE COUNTY RESOURCE AND THEY ARE DIRECTED TO THE RIGHT PLACE.
01:16:18.756: >> AND IN PARTICULAR, THE COUNTY TREASURER'S OFFICE IS KEEPING TRACK OF ALL THE POVERTY AND DIRECTS PEOPLE TO THE LOCAL UNIT AROUND THE POVERTY EXTENSION AS WELL AS BARRIER BUSTERS COULD BE ANOTHER RESOF SOMEBODY WANTED TO PAY THEIR TAXES NOT GO THE ROUTE OF THE EXEMPTION.
01:16:50.054: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER DISCH?
01:16:51.522: >> MR. MARKEY, I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU. I THINK I UNDERSTOOD YOU TO SAY THAT 80% OF THE PEOPLE WHO APPLIED WERE APPROVED AND THOSE WHO WERE NOT APPROVED FAILED -- OREEDED THE ASSET TEST. INDSTAND FROM THE MEMO INCLUDED IN THE PACK THAT THE YOU DOUBLE THE ASSET TEST FOR THIS YEAR. YOU RAISED IT FROM 25K TO 50K. WOULD THAT ADDRESS MANY OF THE PEOPLE WHO EXCEEDED THE ASSET TEST LAST TIME?
01:17:27.125: >> THANK YOU, COUNCILWOMAN AND COUNCILMEMBERS. THE MAJORITY THAT WERE DENIED, A FEW OF THEM OWNED TWO HOUSES AND THEY WERE DENIED BECAUSE THEY HAD ASSET THAT THEY COULD LIQUIDATE AND PAY TAXES. I WOULD FROM REVIEW -- THERE'S POSSIBLY FIVE. OF THE 88 THAT MAY HAVE BEEN AT THE $50,000 LIMIT AT THE VERY MOST, BUT MAJORITY THAT WERE DENIED ASSET TEST. AND CURNTLY THE ASSET TEST IS $25,000 FOR 2020.
01:18:24.482: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS?
01:18:25.917: >> Councilmember Briggs: ONE OF THE QUESTIONS WE GOT AROUND TODAY, THERE WAS A NOTIFICATION IN JE JULY TAXES BUT NOT IN THE WINTER TAXES S. THAT SOMETHING THAT WE WERENNING TO CONSISTENTLY DO EVERY TIME THE TAXES WENT OUT IN TERMS OF COMMUNICATIONS?
01:18:46.904: >> HIMEI'M NOT SURE HOW TO ADDRS THAT. WE DIDN'T DISCUSS WITH THE TREASURER OF THE INCLUDING THE FLYERS WITH THE WINTER BILLS. IT WAS BRIEFLY BROUGHT FORWARD AND IT WAS NOT IMPLEMENTED BUT I WILL NOT SPEAK FOR MR. PETTIGREW OR HIS STAFF. WE DID ACTIVELY PROMOTE IT IN JULY AND I BELIEVE THAT'S WHERE THE MAJORITY OF OUR APPLICANTS WERE BROUGHT FORWARD IN THE JULY BOARD REVIEW AND ALSO DECEMBER.
01:19:21.505: >> Councilmember Briggs: IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S SOME INTEREST IN MAKING SURE THAT WE WERE DOING THAT EVERY TIME TO INCREASE AWARENESS ABOUT IT, AND I WOULD AGREE WITH COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, I WOULD WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE IMPLICATIONS FOR RAISING IT AT DIFFERENT LEVELS. IT'S SOMETHING THAT MAY HAV BEENIVERED TO COUNCIL PREVIOUSLY, IN WHICH CASE YOU CAN JUST SEND IT BACK OUT, IF NOT, COMMUNICATIONS WOULD BE INTEINTERESTED IN SEEING IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU.
01:19:49.700: >> AND FOR THE COUNCIL, WE WOULD BE BLAH GLAD TO DO THAT. WE WILL GATHER THE DOCUMENTS THAT WE HAVE AND THE -- WORK WITH TERESA GO LOTTIE AND HER STAFF TO TRY TO GET A GOOD ESTIMATE OF THE IMPACT IT WOULD HAVE ON THE RESIDENTS OF THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR.
01:20:15.459: >> Mayor Taylor: IN LIGHT OF WHERE FOLKS ARE GOING AND IN LIGHT OF STAFF'S ASSESSMENT OF THE TOLERANCE FOR DELAY, PERHAPS A MOTION TO POSTPONE THIS TO THE SECOND MEETING IN JANUARY? WE HAVE HAYNER AND RADINA IN THE QUEUE. THEN PERHAPS AFTERWARDS OR ONE OF THEM. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
01:20:33.144: >> Councilmeer Hayner: WELL, I MAKE THAT MOTION, BUT I DON'T WANT TO CUT OFF COUNCILMCOUNCILMEMBER RADINA'S . I SAW HIS HAND GO UPT TH SAME TIME. MYNLY COMMENTRIOR T THAT MOTION WAS, THAT YOU KNOW, WE GOT TO -- WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT WHILE WE HAVE THESE ASSET TESTS AND THE INCOME TESTS AND SO ON THAT DETERMINE THIS, THIS IS A WAY THAT WE HELP ONLY HOMEOWNERS IN THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR, AND I WOULD -- MY ESTITION WOULD BE THAT THE THAN THESE -- OF FOLKS WHO MAKE LESS THAN THESE INCOME LEVELS ARE NOT HOMEOWNERS BUT RTERS ERSAND THAT' SOMETHING FOR U A A DY TO CREETHER OPRTUNITIES TO LP FOLKS WHO ARE NO HOMEOWNERS, ASUCH AS I THINKHE VAST MAJOR ITFE OPLE WHO FIND THEMSELS IN TH LOW POVERTY LEVELS. IKLELS I'MMAKING AN ASSPTIONS. THIS IS NOTOMPLETELY GERMANE BUT ARIENY RINDER THAT WE INUR COMMUNITY A I WILL BEBODY HAPPY TO COME BACK AND MOVE THAT AFTER MR. RADINA SPEAKS.
01:21:40.111: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER?
01:21:40.778: >> Councilmember Radina: AT'SAC, G THAT THERE WAS NOT A NEGATIVE IMPACT, WAYS GOING TO MOVE TO POSTPONE THIS TO THE SECOND MEETING IN JANUARY, ASSUMING -- I HAVEN'T CHECKED MY SCHEDULE. I THINK THAT GETS US PAST THE HSSAB PLEAT MEETING.
01:22:01.365: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE A SECOND? DISCUSSION OF POSTPONEMENT? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT'S POSTPONED.
01:22:10.374: >> Clerk Beaudry: AND MAYOR, THAT IS -- MAYOR THAT IS THE SECOND MEETING IN JANUARY?
01:22:15.413: >> Maylor: YES.
01:22:17.448: >> Clerk Beaudry: THANK YOU.
01:22:20.551: >> Mayor Taylor: CA-14, RESOLUTION TO APPROVE AMENDMENT NUMBER ONE FOR PROFESSIONAL SERVICES AGREEMENT WITH RIVENOAK LAW GROUP, FOR $20,000. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER AND SECONDED BY DISCH. DISCUSSION OF CA-14. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
01:22:36.734: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I ASKED THIS TO COME OFF HERE BECAUSE I HAVE -- I DON'T SEE IF -- IN THE ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS ABOUT IT, AND THE DESCRIPTION IN THE RESOLUTION ITSELF DY SAY SPECIFICALLY WHAT THIS IS FOR. IT'S SORT OF A GENERAL NEED FOR THESE LEGAL SERVICES RELATED TO SOME SPECIFIC THINGS IN OSI AND SO I -- I WAS JUST -- IT'S OUT OF BUDGET. IT'S AN EIGHT VOTE -- IT'S A SIX VOTE SITUATION, WHICH I'M NOT SURE WHY -- WHY IT ENDED UP BEING SIX VOTES INSTEAD OF EIGHT. MAY I ASSUME BECAUSE IT'S UNDER $25,000? BUT IT'S OUT OF THE BUDGET. IT FALLS IN THAT CATEGORY. AN WAS JT HOPING T ASK SOMEBODY JUST WHAHAHA WE NEED TO SPECIALIZED SERVICES IN THE OSI THAT OUR CRACK LEGAL TEAM CAN'T HANDLE IF ANYBODY WOULD WANT TO ANSWER THAT FOR ME, I THINK IT WOULD BE FANTASTIC!
01:23:38.529: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. CRAWFORD?
01:23:39.163: >> City Admin. Crawford: AS FAR AS IT BEING OUT OF THE BUDGET, IT'S ACTUALLY -- IT IS WITHIN THE BUDGET. I'M NOT SURE WHY IT'S NOTED AS SIX VOTES REQUIRED. IT'S SIX VOTES REQUIRED BECAUSE IT'S A CONTRACT. AND LEGAL COULD WHICH OR MAYBE JACKIE WHY 'S DESIGNAS SUCH ON THE AGENDA, BUT -- BUT THE NATURE OF IT -- AND MR. POSTEMA, FEEL FREE TO HOP IN.
01:24:04.155: >> City Atty. Postema: THIS IS ON THE RIVENOAK, THE SUSTAINABILITY ISSUE. I HAVE MR. WILHELM ALSO. LET ME GIVE SOME BACKGROUND TO THIS. YOU ALL HAVE TALKED ABOUT SUSTAINABILITY. YOU HAVE LOOKED AT A2ZERO. THE ISSUES WITH ENERGY AND WITHN REGULATORY. THEY ARE OFTEN SPECIALIZED AND THE A2ZERO, IT'S A COST OF A2ZERO THAT HAS NOT BEEN CALCULATED IN ONE SENSE, AND THAT IS THERE ARE MANY ASPECTS OF THIS THAT WILL NEED LEGAL REVIEW AND VERY, VERY SPECIALIZED LEGAL REVIEW. THAT IS JUST IT. WE HAVE OFTEN -- I THINK WE ALWAYS HAD REGULATORYRSTHAT WER. YOU AREETNG INTO A WHOLE AREA WHERE THE LEGAL ISSUES ARE SUBSTANTIAL AND WE WILL BE GROWING THAT CAPABILITY IN ONE SENSE WITH THE OUTSIDE COUNCIL JUST TO POT T SPOT THEM AND SO T IT'S VERY SPECIALIZED WORK AND IT'S NOT USUALLY IN A STANDARD OFFICE. I HAVE TOLD YOU BEFORE THAT WHEN I RECOMMEND OUTSIDE COU,IT'S FO. YOU HAVE GIVEN MISSY STULTS MONEY IN HER BUDGET FOR THIS, AND I THINK THIS IS BEEN USEFUL, BUT IT'S NOT IN ISOLATION. WE ARE WORKING WITH THIS PERSON AND MEET WITH THE PERSON. I DON'T KNOW IF MR. WILHELM CAN ADD TO THIS. THIS IS A VERY BIG DEAL, THE DIRECTION THAT YOU ARE GOING AND IT'S GOING TO BE A WAY OR THE OTHER.
01:26:12.549: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
01:26:13.717: >> Councilmember Nelson: THANK YOU. I WAS ONE OF A COUPLE OF PEOPLE WHO SUBMITTED WRITTEN QUESTIONS TO THE AGENDA ABOUT THIS, ASKING WHAT COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER JUST MENTIONED JUST CURIOUS WHAT SPECIFIC TOPICS. AND SO I GUESS SINCE THAT -- SINCE THAT ANSWER WASN'T VERY PARTICULAR, I GUESS I WOULD. WANT TO CLARIFY THAT THE REASON THAT THE QUESTION WAS ASKED, AT LEAST FOR ME,AVMS OF LEGAL SERVICES ON OUR AGENDA OF IT IS CLARIFIED WHAT IS BEING WORKED ON. IS THIS THE IDEA THAT THIS IS SORT OF ON-CALL, LIKE A RETAINER, JUST TO CALL UP AND ASK QUESTIONS OVER THE COURSE OF A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME OR -- I GUESS I'M CURIOUS IF IT IS NOT ON A PARTICULAR PROJECT -- DO WE HAVE ANY EXPECTATION ABOUT WHEN THIS MIGHT NEED TO BE RENEWED, BECAUSE THE ANSWER IS TO THE WRITTEN QUESTIONS WAS SUCH LONDRYF YOU DED IT UP, BASICALLY GETTING LIKE $500 WORTH OF LEGAL SERVICES ON EACH -- ON 15 DIFFERENT TOPICS. CAN WE GET SOME CLARITY ABOUT THAT, ON WHETHER WE ARE GOING TO BE ASKED TO SPEND ANOTHER $20,000 IN SIX MONTHS OR DO WE HAVE ANY IDEA.
01:27:29.927: >> City Atty. Postema: I THINK THAT THE ANTICIPATION IS THAT THIS WOULD TAKE THIS THROUGH THIS YEAR TO IDENTIFY THOSE ISSUES AND TO BRIEF THOSE ISSUES AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THAT WOULD TAKE USHROU THI THE AMOU FOREXTLL DEPENDENT ON WHAT ISSUES ARE MOVING FORWARD, WHAT ISSUES THAT WE HAVE CAPABILITY HERE TO HANDLE AND WHAT ISSUES ARE GROWING AND DEVELOPING. SO THAT WOULD BE PART OF THE BUDGET PROCESS AND SO I DO NOT ANTICIPATE, ALTHOUGH BEFORE STDR. STULTSIS NOT HERE. I WILL ASK MR. WILHELM IF HE UNDERSTAS ANYRENT, THI HE ONLY REQUE FOR THIS YEAR.
01:28:17.975: >> Councmeer Nelson: THANK YOU. THAT'S HELPFUL.
01:28:20.477: >> City Admin. Crawford: IF I COULD JUST ADD TO THAT, MAYOR.
01:28:23.447: >> Mayor Taylor: PLEASE.
01:28:24.181: >> City Admin. Crawford: I WOULD SPELL IT OUT A LITTLE BIT. I DON'T KNOW THAT WE CAN SAY THAT THAT'S OWL FOR THIS YEAR. THIS IS WHAT SHE ANTICIPATES FOR THE YEAR, BUT THE NATURE -- AS I UNDERSTAND, THE NUMBER OF REASONED PROVIDED IN THE RESPONSE REFLECTS THE COMPLICATED NATURE OF THIS REGULATED AREA SO THE WAY DR. STULTS IS WORKING, SHE WILL PUSH IN A CERTAIN AREA AND SHE MITY QUI WITH ANE A 15 MINUTE OR A HALF HOUR OR HR DISCUSSION, FIND OUT THAT ONE DIRECTION IS OR IS NOT GOING TO WORK ON A PARTICULAR INITIATIVE IT MIGHT BE LISTED HERE AND THE ANOTHER ISSUE MAY TAKE MORE MEETINGS. THIS IS UNLIKE A PIECE OF LITIGATION OR I SAY A PLAN THAT'S WELL-DEVELOPED. THIS IS STILL AN EXPLORATORY STAGES AND THAT'S WHY SO MANY THINGS ARE LISTED HASN'T THIS EXPERTISE IS NEEDED TO KIND OF PUSHIFFERENT TO EXPLORE SOLUTIONS.
01:29:23.740: >>ity Atty. Postem RIGHT. AND TO THE EXTENT IT CAN BE PEELED OFF AND DONE IN-HOUSE WITH ADDITIONAL CAPABILITIES AND AS YOU KNOW, I LIKE TO HANDLE THOSE THINGS IN-HOUSE. I DON'T LIKE TO USE OUTSIDE COUNCOUNSEL IF WE DON'T HAVE TO. BUT ON THE OTHER HAND THIS IS RAMPING UP AND GOING FORWARD AND YOU JUST NEED TO TAKE THAT INTO ACT. YOU HAVE A VERY AMBITIOUS A2ZERO PLAN AND THE PLANTSELF, COSOST D ARE GOI TO NEED TO BE ADDRESSED. THEY ARE ADDRESSED IN THIS BUDGET, AS I UNDERSTAND IT, FOR THE CURRENT YEAR AND THEY WILL NEED TO BE ADDRESSED DURING THE BUDGET SESSION.
01:30:13.557: >> City Admin. Crawford: I'M SORRY TO ADD MORE. I THINK COUNCILMEMBER NELSON HAS RAISED PREVIOUSLY SOME CLARITY -- REQUESTING CLARITY IN HOW WE TITLE RESOLUTIONS. WHILE SHE HAS THIS COVED I THE THE RESOLUTION. THIS INCREASES THIS TO $45,000. IT'S AN INCREMENTAL INCREASE TO TOTAL CONTRACT TO 45. SHOULD A NEED COME UP, WE WOULD COME BACK AGAIN AND SHOW YOU THAT POINT.
01:30:45.923: >> City Atty. Postema: RIGHT.
01:30:46.557: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:30:47.457: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I THINK MY QUESTION WAS ANSWERED BY MR. CRAWFORD. I HAD AS ASKED IN MY WRITTEN QUESTIONS IF WE HAD CONTRACTED AND T RESPONSE GOT WAS THESOOR SAME RESPONSE I GOT TO A EARLIER QUESTION THAT I HAD SO I THINK IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AN OVERSIGHT BY STAFF. I NEVER GOT THE ANSWER. TO THE QUESTION WHETHER WE HAVE CONTRACTED WITH THIS LAW FIRM PRIOR AND IF WE HAD, IN WHAT -- FOR WHAT PURPOSE. SO IF I CAN GET THAT ANSWER. I ASSUME THIS IS AN EXTRA $20,000. THIS IS ONGOING WORK AT THI
01:31:32.235: >>y Admin.wford: CORRECT .
01:31:37.074: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  IT WASN'T IN MY RESPONSE.
01:31:40.243: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
01:31:41.144: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I'M GOING TO ASSUME THAT THIS IS -- I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE THIS IS FOR A GOOD CAUSE. WE HAD A -- I HAD A RESOLUTION THAT WAS WORKED ON WITH SOME RESIDENTS WITH ELECTRIFICATION, AS AN EXAMPLE, MR. POSTEMA. AND I THINK THE OPINION WAS --
01:32:02.466: >> City Atty. Postema: AND WE WEHAT WK IN-HOUSE.
01:32:08.005: >> Councilmeer Hayner: RIGHT.
01:32:08.905: >> City Atty. Postema: SO THE POINT IS WE ARE NOT ABANDONING THIS WORK. IT IS -- IT IS AN AREA WHERE NUMBER ONE, IT'S GROWING. I NEED TO GET PAP UNDERSTANDING BUDGET PROCESS, BUT IT'S A BURGEONING AREA, AND IT'S AN AREA THAT IS GOING TO GROW HE AND GROW AND REGULATED ENVIRONMENTILY. SO YOU JUST NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT THIS WILL BE ADDRESSED AGAIN AT BUDGET TIME.
01:32:44.574: >> Councilmember Hayner:  SO THE LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS THAT GAVE THAT RESOLUTION MAY OR MAY NOT BE ENHANCED BY THIS TYPE OF SERVICE BUT I HOPE THAT IT'S A MAY AND THAT WOULD BE APPRECIATED. AND AL TO MAKE A PUBLIC STATEMENT WHE WE AREALKING ABOUT A 10-YEAR, $1 BILLION CLATE ACTION PN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT $5,000 AAY, $2000 MEANS NHING TO THAT KI OF MONEY. AND SO THAT'S WRE WE ARE A TH THIS CLIMATECTION PLA OPL TO RECOGNIZE THAT COMMITMENT TT WE ARE GOING ON BY SAYING YESO A2ZER IFE GET GOOD OUTCOME LIK I ULD LIKE TO WI T ELECTRICATION THEN SE OF THIS WILL HAVE BEEN WORTH IT.
01:33:26.016: >> CitAttyPoema: AND WRE TAKI THI APPROH INCRENLLY TO ACTUALLY HAVE A COLLABORATIVE APPROACH WHERE THERE ARE THINGS THAT WE WILL STILL DO IN HOUSE AND I WELCOME THAT, BUT WE'RE NOT GOING T WHEN EVERYTHING. IT'S A COLLABORATIVE PROCESS AND WE WILL USE IT TO THE BENEFIT AND THE COST EFFECTIVENESS OF THE CITY. PERIOD.

01:37:06.036: >> HI, CAN YOU HEAR ME? RALPH MCKEE FROM THE FIFTH WARD.
01:37:11.241: >> Mayor Taylor: YES, WE CAN.
01:37:11.875: >> I SENT ALL OF YOU A LONG AND DETAILED EMAIL YESTERDAY DISCUSSING THE HAHN LAWSUIT AND IN RELATIONSHIP TO THE INCREASED WATER RATES. THERE'S WAY TOO MUCH MATERIAL TO GO THROUGH IN THREE MINUTES AND I WILL CUT TO THE CHASE. YOU SHOULD NOT INCREASE OUR WATER RATES UNTIL YOU HAVE RECEIVED THE DETAILEDLYSISHE FRSIDE COUNSEL. HERE'S WHY. THIS SUIT MAY BE THE BIGGEST FINANCIAL THREAT THE CITY HAS EVER FACED. PLAINTIFF'S FIRM IS THE LEADER IN THIS TYPE OF CASE. THIS HE HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL AGAIN AND AGAIN. AND THE DETAIL IN THE COMPLAINT. THE BIGGEST CLAIM, $40 MILLION IS THAT THE CITY IS STILL CHARGING SO  TOO MUCH FOR WATER, SEWER AND STORMWATER. IF PLAINTIFFS ARE RIGHT, CHARGING EVENE I TO A FIRE. EVERY SINGLE DOLLAR OF THE INCREASE WOULD HAVE TO BE REFUNDED WITH INTEREST. SEEMSPRETTY CLEAR THAT WE SHOULD NOT DO THAT UNTIL YOU HEAR THE CAREFUL ANALYSIS, NOT NECESSARILY FROM OUR LEGAL DEPARTMENT BECAUSE THE DECISIONS MADE -- AND THIS IS OBVIOUSLY SENSITIVE, WHICH ARE THE SUBJECT OF THIS LAWSUIT WERE ALLOWED BY CITY LEGAL STAFF WITH FULL KNOWLEDGE OF THE ISSUE THAT'S LOOMING OUT THERE. BECAUSE OF THAT, YOU SHOULD BE WAY MORE HANDS ON IN MANAGING THIS LITIGATION THA YOU BE. AND SHOULD SIT DOWN WITH OUTSIDE COUNSEL VERY, VERY SOON AND ASK BLUNT QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT WORST CASE IS, WHAT THE ODDS ARE IN EACH CLAIM AND WHY, AND WHAT THE STRATEGY, IS WHAT THE KEY ARGUMENTS ARE, AND WHAT AN APPROPRIATE SETTLEMENT MIGHT BE AND WHAT OUR SETTLEMENT APPROACH SHOULD BE, ET CETERA. THIS IS NOT THE CASE THAT YOU CAN JUST SAY LET THE  THE LAWYES HANDLE. IT THAT DOESN'T WORK THAT WELL WITH GELMAN EITHER. I HEARD LAST NIGHT AT CAUCUS THAT YOU ARE BEING TOLD NOT TO DISCUSS POTENTIALROBLEMS HIE AND ISTAND WHY THAT WOULD BE. SAVE THE HARD QUESTIONS TORE CLOSED SESSION -- FOR CLOSED SESSION WITH OUTSIDE COUNSEL, BUT VOTE NO ON THIS UNTIL YOU GET A BETTER HANDLE ON THE LAWSUIT. A FEW MONTH DELAY IS BETTER THAN THROWING GAS ON THE FIRE. TANK YOU.
01:39:31.147: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
01:39:45.829: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER 345, CALLER ENDING IN 345, DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT?
01:39:49.232: >> HELLO, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
01:39:50.633: >> Mayor Taylor: YES, WE CAN.
01:39:53.837: >> OKAY. IS KITTY KHAN, 515 KRAUSS STREET. I'M CALLING YOU IN TO PLEASE VOTE NO ON THE WATER BILL RATE INCREASE. AND I HAVE A QUESTION. I ASKED THIS QUESTION BEFORE, AND I HAVE YET TO GET AN ANSWER. HOW MUCH ARE WE PAYING IN OUR WATER BILLS OORNEY FEES? I KNOW WE ARE PAYING SOME OF THE FEES FOR ATTORNEYS IN THE GELMAN MATTER IN OUR WATER BILLS. AND NOW YOU WILL BE VOTING TO INCLUDE FEES FOR ATTORNEYS IN THE HAHN CASE AS WELL. I FIND THIS ESPECIALLY IRONIC BECAUSE THE HAHN CASE IS ABOUT THE CITY BEING SUED FOR INCLUDING EXPENSES IN OUR WATER BILLS THAT DON'T PERTAIN TO WATER, STORMWATER OR SEWER. AND NOW YOU WANT TO INCLUDE EVEN MORE ATTORNEY FEEN OUR BILLS? THIS DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE AND YET YOU WANT TO RAISE OUR WATER BILLS ONCE AGAIN. SO I WOULD LIKE TO GET AN ANSWER TO MY QUESTION HOW MUCH ARE WE PAYING FOR ATTORNEY FEES IN OUR WATER BILLS? WE, WHO ARE PAYING THESE BILLS, HAVE THEHT T KNOFORMATION. THANK YOU.
01:41:20.156: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
01:41:27.297: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING IN  644 DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT?
01:41:37.340: >> YES, MY NAME IS KATHY BORIS AND I LIVE IN WARD FIVE. MAYOR AND CITY COUNCILMEMBERS, OUR ANN ARBOR WATER BILLS LOOK LIKE MOST ITEMIZED BILLS. THEY LIST THE CHARGES FOR THREE BASIC ITEMS, WATER, SEWER AND STORMWATER DISCHARGE. AN ARBOR WATER CUSTOMERS UNDERSTAND THAT WATER, SEWER AND STORMWATER SERVICES ARE DELIVERED VIA A COMPLICATED INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEM THAT NEED REPAIR AND REPLACEMENT OVER TIME. SO WE EXPECT THESE COSTS TO BE INCLUDED IN THE RATES THAT WE PAY FOR EACH OF THESE SERVICES. AND THEY ARE. BUT WHAT IS SURPRISING TO ME, AT LEAST, IS THAT OUR WATER BILL PAYMENTS ALSO PARTIALLY FUND URBAN FOREST NEEDS, RDW D O COUNSEL FEES PERTAINING TO THE GELMAN PLUME LITIGATION. AND CONSENT AGENDA ITEM NUMBER 13 IS PASSED TONIGHT, THEN OUTSIDE COUNCIL FEES FOR THE HAHN LITIGATION WILL ALSO COME FROM OUR WATER BILLS. THIS SITUATION IS LEAVING ANN ARBOR WATER BILL CUSTOMERS WITH MANY UNANSWERED QUESTIONS. FOR INSTANCE THESE FIVE QUESTIONS. ONE, WHY NOT GELN AND HAHN OUTSIDE COUNSEL FEES FROM THE GENERAL FUND WHERE THE FEES CAN BE MORE EASILY SCRUTINIZED BY THE PUBLIC, LIKE THE WOMAN WHO SPOKE JUST BEFORE ME. QUESTION TWO:  IS ANYONE ON CITY STAFF TASSE TASKED WITH MONITORG WATER AND SEWER RATES AND CASH RESERVES TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH STATEAW? QUESTION NUMBERHREE, IS ANYONE ON CITY STAFF TASSED WITH MONDAY IT -- TASKED WITH MONITORING THE USE OF OUR WATER FUNDS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH STATE LAW. QUESTION NUMBER FOUR, SHOULD THE HAHN LAWSUIT OR ONE LIKE IT, HAVE BEEN FORESEEN AND PREVENTED? QUESTION NUMBER FIVE, WHAT ARE THE CURRENT CASH RESERVES IN OUR WATER, SEWER AND STORMWATER FUNDSESPECTIVEL PLEAWER THESE QUESTIONS PUBLICLY TONIGHT IN YOUR DISCUSSIONS BEFORE YOU VOTE ON WHETHER OR NOT TO RAISE OUR WATER BILLS YET AGAIN.
01:44:15.098: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
01:44:16.632: >> FINALLY, I URGE YOU TO VOTE NO ON ORDINANCE B-2. THANK YOU FOR LISTENING.
01:44:26.943: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. CleLLER WIT UMNDING IN 205, DO YOUAVE A COMMENT? CALLER 205, GO AHEAD.

01:45:33.009: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER 180, DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT?
01:45:36.412: >> HI, THIS IS BRANDON ZINCHOFF IN WARD FOUR. I UNDERSTAND THAT WE DEFERRED THIS RATE INCREASE FROM THE SUMMER DUE TO COVID, AND WHILE I THINK THAT PEOPLE'S POCKETBOOKS APPRECIATED THAT, WE CAN'T KICKING THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD WITH INVESTING IN WATER INFRASTRUCTURE. SO I TRUST COUNCIL'S JUDGMENT TO ADJUST RATES AS THEY ARE NECESSARY TO KEEP UP WITH MAINTENANCE ON WATER INFRASTRUCTURE AND IF THERE'S ONE THING THAT WE SHOULD NOT UNDER INVEST IN, THAT'S WATER. SO LET'S DO WHAT IS RIGHT HERE, AND KEEP OUR -- KEEP OUR WATER AND SEWER SYSTEM GOING FOR THE FUTURE. THANKS.
01:46:36.839: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE WOULD WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING? PLEASE ENTER STAR NINE NOW.
01:46:45.181: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING IN 684, DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT?
01:46:55.558: >> YES. I HAD THIS IS ERIC STURGIS CALLING FROM ANN ARBOR, MICHIGAN. I AM CALLING TO RECOMMEND THAT YOU VOTE AGAINST THE RAISING THE WATER RATES AND I'M NOT GOING TO REALLY COMMENT MUCH MORE ON IT, BUT I JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW AS AN ANN ARBOR RESIDENT AND TAXPAYER, I WANTED TO GIVE MY OPINION. I WILL NOT BE CALLING IN TO THE OPEN CALIFORNIA MEETING TONIGHT AND GIVING MY OPINION ON WHAT THEY ARE DOING. THANK YOU.
01:47:27.290: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING? PLEASE ENTER STAR NINE NOW.
01:47:46.943: >> Clerk Beaudry: MAYOR, I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER HANDS UP.
01:47:49.779: >> Mayor Taylor: SEEING NO ONE, THIS PUBLIC HEARING IS CLOSED.
01:47:53.616: >> Clerk Beaudry: OH, MAYOR, I HAVE ONE MORE.
01:47:56.218: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
01:47:59.522: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER 637, YOU CAN UNMUTE YOURSELF.
01:48:04.927: >> CAN YOU HEAR ME?
01:48:12.134: >> [ BLEEP ]
01:48:21.544: >> Clerk Beaudry: MAYOR, THERE ARE NO MORE CALLERS WITH THEIR HANDS UP.
01:48:31.153: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER 077 DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT ON THIS PUBLIC HEARING?
01:48:37.860: >> I WILL TRY TO BE A LITTLE BIT BETTER THAN THAT LAST COMMENTER. THIS IS ERIC ZUCKER IN WARD TWO. I JUST WANTED CALL IN AND SAY THAT I THINK THAT IT'S TIME THAT WE DO RAISE THE WATER RATES. IT WAS NICE THAT WE WERE ABLE TO GIVE A LITTLE BIT OF A REPRIEVE DURING THE PANDEMIC PREVIOUSLY. AS SOME OF YOU KNOW, I HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THESE WATER RATES PRETTY CLOSELY, AND I HAD LOOKED AT THE RATES FOR THE LAST 18 -- --NO, 22 YEARS, FOR THE AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD THAT USES 18CCF. WE WERE PAYING $30.60 FOR THE WATER BILL. IN 2019, THAT AMOUNT WAS $43.92. THAT'S A 43.5 CENTS INCREASE OVER 22 YEARS FOR WATER. THAT EQUATES TO ABOUT 2% ANNUALLY WHICH IS QUITE A BIT LESS THAN THE AVERAGE INFLATION IN MICHIGAN. I REALIZE THAT IT STINKED TO WANT TO RAISE ANY RATES AT THIS POINT IN TIME, ESPECIALLY IN THE PANDEMIC, BUT I TRUST THE CITY STAFF TO SAY WHEN OUR AMOUNTS ARE OUT OF ALIGN WITH WHAT OUR COSTS ARE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
01:49:56.505: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. I GUESS I WOULD LIKE TO BRIEFLY STEP IN AND SAY I DIDN'T QUITE CATCH THE SPEAKER BEFORE THE LAST SPEAKER. I DIDN'T QUITE CATCH WHAT THEY SAID. I HEARD PROFANITY AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT ELSE I HEARD, BECAUSE IT WAS MUFFLED. OF IT STRUCK ME THAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN A REVOLTING RACIAL EPITAF.
01:50:22.431: >> Clerk Beaudry: THAT IS CORRECT AND THE CALLER HUNG UP.
01:50:25.201: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IF I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT'S ENTIRELY UNACCEPTABLE. IT'S DISGUSTING BEHAVIOR AND INAPPROPRIATE FOR THIS FORUM AND INDEED ANY FORUM AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE -- THAT THIS BODY WILL NEVER TOLERATE AND I WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT THE CLERK FOR -- I'M ASSUMING THE CLERK FOR PUTTING THAT CALLER ON MUTE QUICKLY. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING, PLEASE ENTER STAR NINE NOW.
01:51:04.607: >> Clerk Beaudry: MAYOR YORK SEE ANY CALLERS ON THE LINE WITH THEIR HANDS UP.
01:51:08.577: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. A-1, REGULAR SESSION MEETING MINUTES OF DECEMBER 7, 2020. MAY I HAVE A MOTION TO APPROVE THESE MINUTES MOVED BY RAMLAWI AND SECONDED BY NELSON. DISCUSSION OF THE MINUTES. ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES]
01:51:30.566: >> ALL OPPOSED? THE MINUTES ARE APPROVED. B-1. AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND SECTIONS 5.16.6 AND 5.18.4 OF CHAPTER 55 (UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE) OF TITLE V OF THE CODE OF THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. MOVED BY NELSON AND SECONDED BY RAMLAWI. DISCUSSION O B-1. ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. B-2. AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND SECTION 2:63 OF CHAPTER 29 (WATER RATES) OF TITLE II OF THE CODE OF THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. MOVED BY RAMLAWI, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER DISCH. DISCUSSION OF B-2? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
01:52:24.019: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, MA MAYOR TAYLOR, AND THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A SENSITIVE ISSUE, BASED ON EARLIER CONVERSATIONS WE HAD TONIGHT. I WAS OBVIOUSLY ON COUNCIL WHEN THIS WAS POSTPONED. THIS LAST INCREASE THAT IS IN THISUTION, THERE'S ACTUALLY TWO INCREASES IN THIS ITEM. ONE THAT RATES GO UP 7%, I BELIEVE, JANUARY 1st AND THEN ANOTHER 6.5% IN JULY. THESE FIGURES ARE DOUBLE THE RATE OF INFLATION. AND THESE FIGURES ARE BASED ON A RATE STRUCTURE THAT'S UNDER PERFORMING PROJECTIONS THAT WERE GIVEN ON EARLIER MODELS FAILED TO PRODUCE THE REVENUE THAT WE ANTICIPATED. THAT COUPLED WITH THE REDUCTION IN THE COMMERCIAL CLASS HAS PUT US IN A VERY BAD FINANCIAL POSITION FOR THIS ENTERPRISE FUND. AT LEAST IN A POSITION THAT'S LESS DISIRA DESIRABLE THAN WE HO BE IN. SO IN THE SPIRIT OF COMPROMISE AND THE SPIRIT OF GOOD GOVERNMENT, I WANTED TO OFFER AN AMENDMENT THAT IS, I THINK, INCLUDED IN THIS AND I'M NOT SURE HOW TO TEASE IT OUT, BECAUSE IT'S BEEN KIND OF WRAPPED UP IN ONE AND I'M NOT SURE HOW TO TEASE IT OUT, BUT THE PURPOSE OF MY AMENDMENT WASE INCREASES AND HAVE THE SECOND RATE INCREASE BE VOTED ON WHEN IT WOULD NORMALLY BE VOTED ON AND THAT IS WHEN WE ADOPT OUR BUDGET IN MAY AND THAT WOULD GIVE US THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THE CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT AND SOME OTHER MATTERS AND WE COULD HAVE A FOR INFORMED VOTE ON THE RATE INCREASE IN JULY. SO I WILL -- AISLE NEED A LTLE BIT OF HELP OF EXPLAINING HOW THE PROCEDURAL PROCESS OF THAT AMENDMENT AND THIS RESOLUTION CAN BE VOTED ON.
01:55:06.482: >> Mayor Taylor: I WILL ASK THE STAFF OR THE ATTORNEY'S OFFICE TO MULL THAT OWN POP BACK IN AT SOME POINT.
01:55:17.292: >> City Admin. Crawford: MAYOR, IF MR. HUPY IS HERE -- OR LET'S SEE, ONE OF HIS STAFF. YES, WE HAD WORKED WITH COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI TO HAVE SOME LANGUAGE AROUND THIS. I JUST WANT TO DOUBLE CHECK, MR. HUPY, IF THE LANGUAGE WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT -- REFLECTS WHAT COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI JUST SAID. I'M TRYING TO PULL IT UP MYSELF.
01:55:41.283: >> I BELIEVE IT DOES.
01:55:45.788: >> City Admin. Crawford: I WOULD BE -- MAYOR, WOULD BE -- FOR THAT TO BE FORWARDED AND STAFF CAN GET THAT FORWARDED OR COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI CAN DO IT --
01:55:55.731: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: IT'S ACTUALLY INCLUDED AS PART OF THIS AGENDA ITEM. IT'S ONE THE ATTACHMENTS --
01:56:02.738: >> City Admin. Crawford: OH, I SEE.
01:56:07.076: >> Clerk Beaudry: TOM, IT WAS INCLUDED AS A PROPOSED SUBSTITUTE. I THINK YOU INTO  NEED TO MOVEE SUBSTITUTE ORDINANCE.
01:56:17.319: >> CitAdmin. Crawfd: I SEE THAT ATTACHMENT NOW. ANK YOU.
01:56:21.123: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMB RAMLAWI.
01:56:21.990: >> Councmember Ramla:  I MOVE TO HAVE THI SUBITUTE DINANCTO PUT IN PLACE OF THE MAIN MOTION.
01:56:28.831: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE A SECOND?
01:56:32.801: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: AND,GAIN, THIS --
01:56:38.307: >> Mayor Taylor: SORRY, COUNCILMAN, I ND A SECOND. SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
01:56:43.078: >> Councmember Ramlawi:  SO, AGAIN, THIS AMENDNT THAT I HAVEUT FORTH IS TO ALLOW THE RATE INCREASE TO GORD I JANUARY, AND THEN TECOND TE INCREASEHAT WAS DUE TOO IN EFFEC INULY, WLD BE TAKEN UP AT AATEROINT. AND WHEN ITORMALLY GET TAK SEWEAND STORM A GENERLY VOD ON WIT THE BUDGET OR SHORTLY AFR THE ADOPTIOOF TH BUDT. THIS I A CASE WRE WE' WITHNE VOTE WHICH IS A LITTLE UNUSUAL.
01:57:30.459: >> Mayor Taylor: ON THE AMENDMENT, COUP COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
01:57:39.334: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I'M TRYING TO FIND WHAT YOU ALL ARE DESCRIBING. IT WAS BOUND UP IN HERE.
01:57:46.008: >> City Admin. Crawford: ATTACHM ENTS 4 AND 5 TO THE AGENDA.
01:57:55.017: >> Clerk Beaudry: I CAN SEND I AROUND IF THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL.
01:57:59.688: >> Mayor Taylor: IF YOU COULD, PLEASE. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT OR CAN I MOVE ON TO COUNCILMEMBER DISCH?
01:58:07.429: >> Councilmember Hayner:  FEEL FREE. I WILL GO WITH MY LONGSTANDING NOT VOTING TO RAISE OUR WATER RATES IN ANY CASE, BUT I'M MOST INTERESTED IN WHAT WE ARE SPEAKING TO, AS A BODY, THANK YOU.
01:58:23.278: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBERD.
01:58:26.515: >> Councilmember Disch: I'M SORRY TO EXPRESS CONFUSION. I'M CONFUSED IN THE MEMO FROM MR. CRAWFORD. THAT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE REDUCED TO 3.5%. DID I MISUNDERSTAND THE MEMO THAT --
01:58:49.771: >> City Admin. Crawford: YOU DID NOT. IT IS REDUCED FROM WHAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HAD WE DONE THE INCREASE IN JULY. SO YOU CAN IMAGINEHAT IF WE HAD DONE THE INCREASE IN JULY OF 2020, YOU WOULD HAVE COLLECTED A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF REVENUE OVER THAT YEAR, BY DEFERRING THAT SIX MONTHS, YOU CAN SEE HOW WE WOULD HAVE TO INCREASE THE HIGHER AMOUNT OF REVENUE TO EQUAL THE SAME AMOUNT AND THE LAST SIX MONTHS, STAFF AND THIS RESOLUTION OR ORDINANCE REDUCED THAT SO THAT IT WAS NOT THE FULL INCREASE. THE EXACT AMOUNT OF THAT AND THE DESCRIPTION, I WILL LET STAFF DO.
01:59:28.176: >> Mayor Taylor: WHICH STAFF MEMBER, MR. CRAWFORD? TOMS I'M SORRY, MARTI PRASCHAN, SHE MAY BE ABLE TO HELP US IF WE HAVE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS.
01:59:46.161: >> Mayor Taylor: MS. PRASCHAN.
01:59:47.029: >> YES, AS GATE AS INDICATED INE MEMO, IT WAS TO MOVE THE ORIGINAL INCREASE FORWARD EFFECTIVE JANUARY. SO IF WE SIX MONTHS, WE WOULD EFFECTIVELY HAVE TO DOUBLE THE INCREASE TO ACHIEVE THE REVENUE WE HAD DESIRED. INSTEAD WE BACKED THAT REQUEST DOWN AND WE ARE ONLY REQUESTING THE 6% FOR THE LAST SIX MONTHS OF THE YEAR.
02:00:15.090: >> Councilmember Disch: OKAY. AND COULD I ASK, THE MEMO ALSO REFERENCES A 3.5% INCREASE FOR FISCAL YEAR '21, WHICH IS -- AGAIN, IT'S 3% LESS WHAT WAS PROJECTED.
02:00:31.807: >> RIGHT. WHICH WE BACKED IT DOWN BECAUSE WE WERE TRYING TO MITIGATE THE INCREASE. WE THOUGHT WE WOULD GET BY WITH A SMALLER INCREASE IN '21.
02:00:40.449: >> Councilmember Disch: YES, I WANTED TO GET THAT ON THE TABLE BECAUSE THERE'S CONSIDERABLE CONCERN ABOUT THE RATE INCREASES AND YOU HAVE REDUCED THEM.
02:00:53.095: >> YES.
02:01:05.173: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. RADINA?
02:01:05.774: >> Councilmember Radina: I THINK MY BIGGEST QUESTION WITH THE PROPOSED AMENDMENT WOULD BE WHETHER OR NOT BY DECUMMING THEG THEM TO CONTINUE MAKING INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS, DOES -- MY BIGGEST CONCERN IS MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT OUR INFRASTRUCTURE IS IN PLACE TO PROVIDE A SAFE WATER -- A SAFE WATER SUPPLY, WITH A SECOND -- BY DECOUPLING THIS, IS THIS ANY CONCERN WITH THE URN CERTAINTY OF A FUTURE IN -- -- UNCERTAIN OF A FUTURE INCREASE, FUTURE INCREASES?
02:01:53.755: >> I WILL TAKE THE ANSWER TO THAT. YES. WITH THE RATE INCREASE NOW, WE CAN HAVE MORE CERTAINTY ON THE REVENUE AS WE PLAN OUR CAPITAL PROJECTS. WITHOUT THAT CERTAINTY, WE WOULD HAVE TO SO TO SPEAK SLOW-PEDAL THE PROJECTS UNTIL RATE WAS IN PLACE TO SUPPORT THEM.
02:02:16.044: >> Councilmember Radina: THANK YOU.
02:02:18.880: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
02:02:19.748: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I HAVE A QUESTION. I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS. FIRST IS WHEN -- HOW OFTEN HAS COUNCIL VOTED FOR A JULY INCREASE IN DECEMBER FOR THE PRIOR YEAR? HOW OFTEN HAVE WE VOTED FOR AN INCREASE, SIX, SEVEN, MONTHS AHEAD OF THE FISCAL YEAR? I'M ASKING WHETHER IT'S TRADITIONALLY MOSTLY DONE IN MAY WITH THE BUDGET, AND STILL GIVES STAFF THE COMFORT AND PREDICTABILITY OF MAINTAINING THE INFRASTRUCTURE WITHOUT JEOPARDIZING THE WELFARE AND THE SAFETY OF OUR CITIZENS AND COMMUNITY. I FEEL LIKE THE LAST STATEMENT MADE BY MR. HUPY IS -- I TAKE -- I'M JUST -- I'M A LITTLE -- I TAKE PAUSE WITH IT BECAUSE I'M NOT QUITE SURE THAT THAT'S THE WAY IT HAS BEEN UP UNTIL NOW, WHERE WE HAD A VOTE IN DECEMBER IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS. I THOUGHT, AGAIN, THESE RATE INCREASES WERE DONE PRIMARILY IN APRIL AND MAY.
02:03:35.423: >> City Admin. Crawford: YEAH. AND STAFF CAN CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG, BUT MY RECOLLECTION IS THEY ARE TYPICALLY DONE IN MAY. I BELIEVE THE PERSPECTIVE MR. HUPY IS REFERRING TO, THERE WAS NOT AN INCREASE APPROVED IN '19, AND SO HAVING THAT HISTORY WHICH SET THE PLAN BACK, YOU NO HE, IS IT LOGISTICALLY POSSIBLE TO MOVE FORWARD AND HAVE IT SACRIFICE APPROVED IN MAY. WITH THE COMPLEXITY OF IMPLEMENTING THEM BECAUSE A WATER PROJECT IS DONE UNDERKNEE THE ROAD, FOR EXAMPLE, AND SO WE HAVE TO TIE IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT PROJECTS. HAVING THAT STABILITY OF APPROVAL IS REALLY HELPFUL IN THE PLANNING SO WE DON'T HAVE TO DEFER PROJECTS WOULD YOU NOT LIKELY HAVE HAD THIS IF WE HAD THIS REQUEST IN DECEMBER FOR THIS COMING JULY, IF WE HAD NOT HAD A '19 INCREASE, IT WOULD BE MY IMPRESSION. AND IF STAFF WANTS TO MAKE ADDITIONAL COMMENT ON THAT, THEY ARE CERTAINLY WELCOME TO.
02:04:46.728: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I THOUGHT WE DID PASS AN INCREASE IN '19, AND JUST DEFERRED THE '20.
02:05:04.079: >> WE DID NOT GET A WATER INCREASE IN JULY OF '19.
02:05:08.984: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  IT WOULD ALLOW THE RATE INCREASES GO FORWARD IN JANUARY AND HAVE COUNSECOUNCIL REVIEW IN THIS JU. I THINK FOR OUR COMMUNITY THAT IS FACING A PANDEMIC WITH SCARY OUTLOOKS RIGHT NOW, I THINK WE CAN EXTEND THAT OFFER TO OUR SENTENCES AS MUCH AS WE WANT TO HAVE THE COMFORT IN OUR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS WE ALSO HAVE AC RIGHT NOW THAT HAS ITS OWN FINANCIAL ISSUES AND PROBLEMS TO DEAL WITH. I THINK THIS IS SCARY FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE TO SEE TWO RATE INCREASES AT ONE, OF DOUBLE THE RATE OF INFLATION, ALL WITHIN SIX MONTHS DURING A PANDEMIC.
02:05:51.459: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
02:05:52.861: >> Councilmember Griswold: COULD STAFF EASILY GIVE US THE FUND BALANCE IN THESE THREE THRE ACCOUNTS WAS ASKED BY ONE OF THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC? AND WHEN WE ARE COLLECTING FUNDS WITH THE CAPITAL PROJECTS DO THE FUNDS MATCH WITH CAPITAL PROJECTS WITHIN A GIVEN TIME PROPECT OF 12 MONTHS, TWO YEARS OR THREE YEARS OR ARE WE ALSO COLLECTING FUNDS FOR LARGAL CAPITAL PROJECTS THAT MAY NOT BE FOR FIVE OR MORE YEARS? RYING TO UNDERSTAND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE FUNDS COLLECTED AND WHEN WE ARE GOING TO SPEND THE FUNDS.
02:06:54.255: >> City Admin. Crawford: WOULD YOU LIKE TO ANSWER THAT?
02:06:57.092: >> MARTI CAN ANSWER FUND BALANCE AND SHE CAN TALK ABOUT HOW WE TIE TO CAPITAL NEEDS.
02:07:10.805: >> SO OUR NUMBERS ARE AVAILABLE PROPRIETARY IN THE CITY'S ANNUAL CAFR. THE UNRESTRICTED WATER SUPPLY WAS $9.8 MILLION AND SEWER $32.5 MILLION AND IN STORMWATER $13.6 MILLION. THOSE ARE ROUNDED, OF COURSE. INDEED WE DO COLLECT FUNDING TO FUND LONG-TERM FINANCIALLY LARGE PROJECTS. WE COLLECTED FOR PLANT RENOVATIONS. WE HAD A TEN-YEAR PLAN TO COLLECT THE FUNDS NECESSARY TO DO THAT PROJECT.
02:07:58.653: >> Councilmember Griswold: OH, OKAY. THANK YOU. AND I KNEW THAT THE INFORMATION WAS AVAILABLE ONLINE, BUT I WANTEDO -- SOMEONE DESCRIB ITHIS EVENING. AND CAN YOU ALSO SPEAK T OUR PRACTICE OF COLLECTING FUNDS IN ADVANCE OF AROJECT AS OPPOSED TO BONDING FOR PROJECT?
02:08:28.616: >> PICALLY FOR LGE PROJECTS ACTUALLY UTILI BOTH. IN THESSUE OF THE WASTETER TRTMENT PLANT RENOVATIONS, WE ACTUALLY DIDSE CASH, AS WELL AS BONDING. SO WE USE BOTH METHODS. TO FUND PROJECTS OF THAT NATURE.
02:08:46.701: >> Councilmemb Griswold: AND ARE WE MORE FORTUNATE THAN TO COLCTUNDS POR TO A ABILITY CAPITAL PROJECT
02:08:59.113: >> I D'T KNOW THA I COULD S INFORMION ABOUT OTHOUT HAVG MMUNITIES AT HD. I WOULD SAY THAT TYPICLY WE DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM IN THAT AR AND WE ARE FORTUNA WIT OUR BOND RATIN THAT ALL U TO BONDHE MONEY. SO, AGN, IT'S KIND OF DIFFICT TO SAY WHEN I DON'T HAVE OTHER INFORMATION AVAILABLE.
02:09:24.172: >> AND I WOULD SUPPORT WHAT MARTI JUST SAID. OUR BOND RATINGS SUPPORT THE FISCALEMENT OF THE ENTERPRISE FUND.
02:09:39.420: >> Councilmember Griswold: OH, OKAY. AND THEN MY LAST POINT IS WHILE WE ARE IF WE WERE TO DELAY THESE INCREASES, THERE WOULD BE SOME RISK ASSOCIATED WITH IT, GIVEN HAVE YOU VERY GOOD TO EXCELLENT BOND RATING, THE RISK IS NOT AS GRAPHGREAT AS IT MIGHT BE TO ARR A COMMUNITY WITH A LOWER RATING?
02:10:02.810: >> I ALSO WOULD NOT GO AS IF A ARE TO SAY THAT WITHOUT LOOKING AT IT IN DETAIL.
02:10:08.616: >> Council OH, OKAY.
02:10:09.784: >> WE WOULDN'T NECESSARILY BE ISSUING A BOND FOR EVERY CAPITAL PROJECT THAT WE UNDERTAKE. SOMETIMES WE BOND AFTER THE PROJECT AND SOMETIMES WE BOND BEFORE THE PROJECT IT. DEPENDS ON THE SITUATION.
02:10:23.264: >> Councilmember Griswold: OKAY. THANK YOU. AGAIN, THESE ARE QUESTIONS THAT CONSTITUENTS HAVE ASKED AND I PREFERRED THAT EXPLAIN IT. SO THANK YOU.
02:10:48.356: >> Councilmember Grand: I WOULDN'T BE SUPPORTING THE RESOLUTION. I DIDN'T WANT TO SEE A 13% INCREASE COME BEFORE A NEW COUNCIL IN JANUARY. I FELT THAT THAT WAS UNFAIR TO PUT THE BURDEN ON COUNCIL AND TO BRING THAT KIND OF SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC ON OUR WATER REPAIRS SO I APPRECIATE STAFF'S RESPONSIVENESS AND GETTING IT DONE, BUT ALSO GIVEN THE TREPIDATION AND MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE A STEADIER STREAM OF FUNDING COMING IN AND ONE THAT IS MORE SECURE AND ALSO HAVING BEEN ON THE END OF THESE QUIGGS HAVING TO RAISE RATES CONSISTENTLY BECAUSE OF COUNCILS WHO HAVE NOT WANTED TO, BECAUSE IT'S NOT FUN TO RAISE RATES. IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE ENJOY PARTICULARLY DURING THIS TIME. BUT ONE OF THE FACTORS THAT MAKES ME FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE WITH THIS, OTHER THAN MAKING NECESSARY INVESTMENTS IN CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE, WE HAVE BEEN ASSURED BY STAFF THAT THERE ARE RESOURCES FOR THOSE WHO CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY THEIR WATER BILLS AND THAT CONTINUING TO MAKE BOTH WITH ENCOURAGEMENT OF STATE LEVEL POLICY AND ALSO PUTTING ADDITIONAL RESOURCES INTO THOSE FUNDS THAT WE ARE BOTH ON ONE END ASKING OUR WATER RATE USERS -- OUR WATER USERS TO SHOULDER A LITTLE MORE OF THAT BURDEN, KNOWING THAT THAT ESSENTIAL INFRASTRUCTURE IS PROVIDING WATER TO EVERYONE IN OUR COMMUNITY AND THAT NO ONE WILL BE DENIED THAT RESOURCE. SO I'M JUST NOT LOOKING TO DISCUSS THIS AGAIN ANY TIME SOON. AND HOPING THAT WE CAN PROVIDE THE RESOURCES THAT WE NEED IN THE MONTHS AHEAD FOR THIS ESSENTIAL FUND.
02:12:58.486: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS?
02:12:59.921: >> Councilmember Briggs: YEAH. I GUESS IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING SOME CERTAINTY FOR STAFF, I CAN ACTUALLY MENTION HOW THIS APPROVAL OF WATER RATE INCREASES WILL PROVIDE CERTAINTY FOR RESIDENTS AS WELL FOR THE BUDGET AHEAD. SINCE THIS IS A PROCESS CHANGE THIS YEAR, LED BY THE CHALLENGES OF SECURING RATE INCREASES LAST YEAR, IS THIS A PROCESS CHANGE THAT IS LIKELY TO BE PERMANENT OR IF THERE ARE FUTURE RATE INCREASES MIGHT WE SEE THOSE OCCURRING -- BEING VOTED ON AT DIFFERENT TIMES OF YEAR IN THE FUTURE?S THIS A ONE-TIME OCCURRENCE? OR DO WE EXPECT THAT THIS IS THE NEW PROCESS.
02:13:51.005: >> MR. CRAWFORD, DO YOU WANT ME TO TAKE THAT?
02:13:52.874: >> City Admin. Crawford: YES, PLEASE.
02:13:56.811: >> IDEALLY, THE RATE INCREASES WOULD OCCUR JUST AHEAD OF THE BUDGET APPROVAL SO THAT THERE ARE RATES TO SUPPORT THE BUDGET. GENERALLY, HISTORICALLY, THEY OCCURRED WITH THE BUDGET OR SLIGHTLY AFTER. BUT GIVEN STAFF'S PREFERENCE, IT WOULD BE A MEETING OR TWO AHEAD OF THE BUDGET. HAD.
02:14:29.544: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
02:14:30.444: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I APPRECIATE THAT LAST STATEMENT AS WELL. TO CLARIFY THE MATTER, I THINK IT'S BEEN CONCLU CONFUSING, THAU ARE NOT DELAYING ANY MOREREVENU. WE'RE JUST DELAYING THE VOTE FOR THE SECOND RATE INCREASE UNTIL THE TIME THAT WE TRADITIONALLY WOULD TAKE THAT VOTE. AND IN THAT TIME, WE WOULD LEARN MORE ABOUT THE PENDING LAWSUIT THAT WE ARE IN. AND WE WOULD GIVE OUR COMMUNITY COMFORT. I RECEIVED A DOZEN EMAILS ABOUT THE RATE INCREASES AND PEOPLE FEELING PRICED OUT OF ANN ARBOR. I KNOW IT DOESN'T TO US, BECAUSE MAYBE COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER IS THE ONLY ONE WHO SELF-IDENTIFIES AS BEING STRICKEN WITH -- AND I WILL LET HIM SPEAK IT. I DON'T WANT TO TALK TOO MUCH ABOUT PEOPLE'S PERSONAL FINANCES BUT I THINK WE'RE SORT OF -- SO ME AT LEAST, I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE HURTING RIGHT NOW AND I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR TO DO TWO RATE INCREASES AT ONCE, WHEN WE NORMALLY WOULDN'T EVEN BE DOING THAT.
02:15:57.131: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER DISCH.
02:15:57.965: >> Councilmember Disch: I WON'T BE SUPPORTING THE AMENDMENT BECAUSE TO PUT IT A LITTLE CRUDELY. I FEEL THAT STAFF IS HANDING US A GOOD DEAL AND I THINK WE SHOULD ACT ON IT. THE FIGURES THAT WE SAW AT FIRST READING OF THE INCREASE WERE I BELIEV WAS A 6.5% INCREASE NOW AND WE ARE VOTING ON AN INCREASE THAT WAS DEFERRED FROM JULY. SO SIX MONTHS OF -- OF COURSE WE HAD NO INCREASE IN FISCAL YEAR '19. THEN COUNCIL DEVOTED TO DEFER THE FISCAL YEAR '20 INCREASE SO THAT WAS ANOTHER SIX MONTHS WITHOUT AN INCREASE THAT ARE NOT GOING TO BE MADE UP AND WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT NOW IS A 6% INCREASE FOR THE NEXT SIX MONTHS AND THEN A 3.5% INCREASE FOR FISCAL YEAR '21 AND THAT'S DOWN FROM 6.5%. SO I THINK THAT THAT IS -- I SEE THAT COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI IS SHAKING HIS HEAD, BUT I THINK THAT IS WHAT WAS JUST EXPLAINED TO US.
02:17:11.138: >> IF I CAN JUMP IN. THE RATE INCREASE WAS NOT IN LAST JULY. IF I MISSPOKE SAYING WE DIDN'T GET A '19 INCREASE. WE DID GET AN INCREASE IN '19. WE DID NOT GET THE JULY INCREASE AND I'M LOOKING AT MARTI TO MAKE SURE I SAID THAT CORRECTLY. NO.
02:17:32.193: >> NO. NO. WE DID NOT GET AN INCREASE IN FISCAL YEAR '19. COUNCIL DECIDED TO DELAY THAT INCREASE UNTIL THE -- UNTIL THE COST OF SERVICE WAS REVIEWED.
02:17:44.739: >> OKAY.
02:17:45.005: >> AND THEN COUNCIL HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE CHANGES TO THE TIERS AND THE STRUCTURE. THEREFORE WE DID NOT RECEIVE A FISCAL YEAR '19 INCREASE.
02:17:57.218: >> SO I WAS CORRECT THE FIRST TIME.
02:17:59.720: >> YES.
02:18:00.087: >> Councilmember Disch: AND SO PLEASE CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG, BUT THERE WAS NO FISCAL YEAR '19 INCREASE. THE FISCAL YEAR '20 INCREASE WAS POSTPONED FOR SIX MONTHS. AND IT IS NOT MADE UP. WE ARE APPROVING NOW AN INCREASE OF 6% INSTEAD LAST JULY AN INCREASE OF 6% AND YOU ARE ASKING US TO APPROVE A SOND CRSE AT THIS TIME TO TAKE EFFECT FOR FISCAL YEAR, THE ENTIRETY OF FISCAL YEAR '21 OF 3.5%. WHICH IS LESS THAN WHAT YOU PROJECTED TWO WEEKS AGO WHEN WE LOOKED AT THIS. I THINK THAT STAFF IS ASKING FOR STABILITY. TO -- NOT TO PAY LEGAL FEES BECAUSE THE COST OF LEGAL FEES IS NEGLIGIBLE, WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A RLY $8BILLIOLL THREE FUNDS. WHAT IS DRIVING OUR WATER RATES IS NOT FLUCTUATIONS IN USE. IT'S NOT LEGAL FEES. IT'S AGING INFRASTRUCTURE AND STAFF NEEDS THE STABILITY TO FLAN FOR THE PROJECTS TO FIX THAT INFRASTRUCTURE. SO I WILL VOTE FOR WHAT STAFF IS ASKING FOR AND NOT FOR THE AMENDMENT.
02:19:22.470: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RADINA member I THINK UNFORTUN IEALLY APPRECIATE COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI'S AMENDMENT. I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE WHAT I BELIEVE HIS INTENGS ARE, WHICH -- INTENTIONS ARE, WHICH IS TO PROVIDE SOME RELIEF TO OUR RESIDENTS, BUT I UNFORTUNATELY DON'T THINK I CAN SUPPORT THIS AMENDMENT EITHER AT THIS TIME. I THINK UNFORTUNATELY SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE MUCH MORE DAMAGING IS IF WE WERE TO HAVE AN INFRASTRUCTURE FAILURE AND THE TASTE OF OUR WATER SUPPLY IS AND ULTIMATEL I WANT TO PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR US TO INVEST IN INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS NOW BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE. I WILL BE VOTING NO AS WELL.
02:20:08.516: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER SONG.
02:20:18.792: >> Councilmember Song: I REVIEWED THE 2005 WATER TREATMENT PLANT ALTERNATIVES EVALUATION, AND I WAS JUST STRUCK BY HOW LONG THIS REVIEW HAS GE FOR TO MAINTAIN AGING INASTRUCTURE. CAN WE HAV SOMEONE SPEAK TO IF RATEAREN'T PSED HOW DISRUPTI THAT IS TO CURRENT INFRTRUCTURE PROCTS AND -- I ME, I THINK O WER MAIN BREAKSNDT'ISIVE FORRYINGOR A YING TO ACCESS CLEAN WER DURING A PANDEMIC. CAYOURAME THATOR M H DISRUPTIVE NOT INVESTING IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE WOULD LOOK LIKE?
02:21:14.815: >> THE IMPACTS ARE LONGER TERM THE EXAMPLE IS THE REPLACEMENT FOR THE 1930s PLANT, WHILE WE STRUGGLE TO MAINTAIN IT, WE CAN MAINTAIN I IT ONE OF WE HAVE NOT PUT FORWARD WITH THE PLANT RIGHT AWAY IS AS WE LOOKED AT PFAS AND OTHER EMERGING CONTAMINANTS WE HAD TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE ALLOWING SPACE AND ROOM FOR TECHNOLOGY FOR THE FUTURE CONTAMINANTS THAT WE DON'T KNOW. SO WE TOOK A PAUSE IN THAT. IT HAS AN IMPACT IN AGING. AS I SAY IT'S NOT ONLY THE MAINS, BUT THE PUMP STATION, THE PLANT ITSELF. WHILE IT'S NOT AN IMPACT TOMORROW, BUT IT'S A CUMULATIVE IMPACT OF OVER THE YEARS NOT INVESTING.
02:22:28.389: >> Councilmember Song: THANK YOU.
02:22:29.256: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE AMENDMENT? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, I THINK YOU HAD TWO BITES AT THIS.
02:22:39.633: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I KNOW. JUST HAV HARD TIME -- A IUESS WE CAN TAKE IT UP LATER ABOUT THE RATE INCREASES NOT IN '19, BECAUSE I THOUGHT -- I'M LOOKING AT CITY COUNCIL LEGISLATION THAT SAYS THAT RATE INCREASES WERE PASSED IN '19. SO I'M SORRY. I'M TAKING UP TIME BUT I'M HUNG UP ON THAT. I DON'T KNOW IF STAFF CAN EMAIL ME SOMETHING, BUT I DVP I'M LOOKING AT THANKS THAT TELLS ME THAT RATES WERE PASSED.
02:23:12.800: >> City Admin. Crad: COUNCAMLAWF LOOKS AT THAT, WHAT MAY BE CONFUSING -- AND IF I REMEMBER THIS CORRECTLY, AND MARTI, CORRECT ME IF I'M PRONG. WITH WE ADOPT -- I'M WRONG. WHEN WE ADOPT A BUDGET, THAT'S A REVENUE PLAN. WE MAY HAVE ADOPTED THE BUDGET, BUT IF YOU DON'T PASS RATES WE DON'T ACTUALLY ACTUALIZE ANY INCREASE? REVENUE. AND THAT MAY BE THE SOURCE OF THE CONFUSION.
02:23:47.534: >> Mayor Taylor: IECOLLECT, THE RESTRUCTURE OF THE RATES WAS SUPPOSED TO BE REVENUE NEUTRAL. SO AS TO ALLOW THE --
02:23:53.974: >> CORRECT.
02:23:54.308: >> Mayor Taylor: THIS IS THE RESTRUCTURER THE DIFFERENT TIERS AND THAT WAS A REVENUE NEUTRAL CONVERSATION FOR THE RESIDENTS TO AT JUST WITH ONLY ONE VARIABLE.
02:24:13.794: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  THE AGENDA ITEM IS MAY 6th OF 2019, THAT I'M LOOKING AT. MY APOLOGIES IN I'M WRONG.
02:24:32.079: >> SO FROM MAY 6th, 2019, WE WOULD ACTUALLY BE PASSING RATES FOR OUR FISCAL YEAR '20 BECAUSE OUR FISCAL YEAR IS JULY 1st TO JUNE 30th. AND SO THAT'S FOR FISCAL YEAR '20 AND THE REVENUE NEUTRAL CHANGE WAS IN FISCA YEA '19, WHICH ENDS JUNE 30th, 2019. SO IN '1818 IT AFFECTS '19, ANDN '19 --
02:25:16.557: >> YES.
02:25:16.824: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT MY COLLEAGUES UNDERSTAND THIS.
02:25:23.330: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? FOR MY PART, I'M VOTING AGAIN THE AMENDMENT AND IN FAVOR OF THE RATES BACK IN THE COUPLER. WE POSTPONED THIS RATE INCREASE THEN ON THE CONDITION IF YOU WILL OR IN RELIANCE OF OUR WILLINGNESS TO RAISE RATES HERE, AS WE HEAR FROM STAFF FURTHER, IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE PROVIDE A MEASURE OF CERTAINTY. THE MAI SUPPORT CAPAL STEM AS COMPLEX, AS COSTLY AND AGED AND AS CRITICAL AS OUR WATER INFRASTRUCTURE IS -- THE WATER TREATMENT SYSTEM OR THE WATER DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM, IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE STABILITY. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE PREDICTABILITY. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE CONTINUE TO INVEST INCREMENTALLY SO THAT THE SYSTEM IS HERE FOR US, AND OF INCREDIBLE IMPORTANCE THAT THE SYSTEM IS HERE FOR FUTURE ANN ARBOR RESIDENTS. YOUW, ENJOY INFRASTRUCTURE BECAUSE IT WAS PAID FOR BY OUR PREDECESSORS. AND IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO, I THINK, TO DO OUR PART FOR ANN ARBOR'S FUTURE RESIDENTS, AND THAT INCLUDES SPENDING MONEY NOW IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR WATER INFRASTRUCTURE IS READY FOR CONTAMINANTS OF THE FUTURE AND READY TO DELIVER, YOU KNOW, SAFE DRINKING WATER TODAY.FU I T TO NOTE THAT IT IS A DIFFICULT TIME FOR SO MANY. BUT ALSO THAT THERE ARE RESOURCES AVAILABLE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE UNABLE TO EITHER WAY THE RATES AS WHOLE, OR IF THIS MORE THANNAL INCREASE PUTS SOMEBODY OVER -- MARGINAL INCREASE PUTS SOMEBODY OVER THE EDGE, THERE'S WAYS TO HELP THESE FOLKS AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE US ALL AT THE CITY AND OTHER AREAS OF THE COMMUNITY TO COMMUNICATE THAT TO FOLKS WHEREV FM PEOPLE WOULD DO HAVE HAVE PAYMENT DIFFICULTIES. ROLL CALL VOTE ON THE AMENDMENT. I DON'T KNOW WHO THIS STARTS WITH. AND MY APOLOGIES TO WHOMEVER IS ON POINT.
02:27:50.777: >> Clerk Beaudry: WE'LL START WITH COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD TONIGHT.
02:27:53.914: >> Mayor Taylor: MY APOLOGIES FOR NOT ASKING ABOUT IT AND LETTING YOU KNOW IN ADVANCE.
02:27:57.317: >> Councilmember Griswold: THAT'S OKAY.
02:28:05.525: >> Councilmemb N
02:28:11.898: >> Councmember Grand: NO.
02:28:16.336: >> Councilmember Radina: NO.

02:28:36.923: >> Councilmember Disch: NO.
02:28:37.524: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION FAILS.
02:28:38.458: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN MOTN. UNLMEMBER RAMLAWI?
02:28:45.432: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: WELL, UNFORTUNATELY, THE FAILURE OF THE PRIOR AMENDMENT PUTS ME IN A POSITION NOW OF SAYING NO ON THE MAIN MOTION. IT'S UNFOR THE THAT THE ORGMENTS WERE MUDDLED, MADE UNCLEAR, AND REALLY DISAPPOINTING TO SEE THE LACK OF CLARITY AND UNDERSTANDING ONHISSSUE ISSUEE TAKING A VOTE. THE AMENDMENT WOULD HAVE SIMPLY DELAYED THIS MAIN MOTION, THE SECOND RAISE FOR THE CUSTOMARY TIME THAT COUNCIL APPROVES RATES TO BE RAISED, AND UNFORTUNATELY, I THINK THIS BODY, AS A WHOLE IS VERY DISCONNECTED WITH THE STRUGGLES OF PEOPLE, THE WORKs CLASS. THEY ARE STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET. IT'S SIMPLY OUTFCH AND THE LAST VOTE JUST CEMENTED. IT. THERE WAS NO REASON TO VOTE DOWN THAT PRIOR AMENDMENT THAT WE ARE IN A PANDEMIC WHERE PEOPLE ARE STRUGGLING. WHERE A HALF MILLION PEOPLE IN MY INDUSTRY OR UNEMPLOYED. A HALF MILLION PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF MICHIGAN ARE UNEMPLOYED, BUT THIS COUNCIL THINKS, IT'S AI GOOD IDEA TO RAISE YOUR RATES SIX MONTHS EARLY. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.
02:30:29.636: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
02:30:31.071: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. LAST WEEK AT OUR RETREAT, WE TALKED ABOUT NOT TAKING VOTES ON POLICY DIFFERENCES AND INTERPRETING THAT AS SOMETHING PERSONAL OR TRYING TO AT ASSUME THOSE WHO VOTE DIFFERENTLY THAN YOU ARE. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, I WILL ASSURE YOU THAT MY HEAD I LED. ERFE CLE IN MAKING DECISIONS AND IT DOESN MEAN THAT I DON'T CARE ABOUT PEOPLE IN THIS COMMUNITY. THAT'S WHY I HAVE HAD CONVERSATIONS THROUGHOUT THE LAST WEEK TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE RESOURCES FOR THOSE WHO CAN'T AFFORD THIS ESSENTIAL RESOURCE, TO MAKE SURE THAT NO ONE IS GOING WITHOUT SAFE WATER. WE ENTER HAVE TO LOOK TO EXAMPLING IN OUR STATE ABOUT HOW COSTLY IT BECOMES WHEN WE DON'T MAKE THESE RITTICAL INVESTMENTS IN OUR WATER INFRASTRUCTURE. AND WE HAVE CONTAMINANTS NOW. WE NEED TO MAKE THESE INVESTMENTS SO THAT NOT ONLY ARE WE THINKING ABOUT THE FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS BUT ALSO ABOUT THE PUBLIC HEALTH IMPLICATIONS OF THESE DECISIONS AND -- BUT TO INSINUATE OUR STAFF, ARE MUDDLES OR THAT WE ARE MUDDLED IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THIS, BECAUSE WE DISAGREE WITH YOU, IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE. AND I UNDER WHERER PASSOMING FROM. I RESPECT ITRENDOUSLY AND I RESPECT THAT PERWILL SPECKIVE, BUT -- PERSPECTIVE, BUT PLEASE DON'T INSULT ME AND MY COLLEAGUES. YOU WANT TO INSULT ME, PLEASE, YOU HAVE DONE THAT MANY TIMES BEFORE. BUT DON'T INSULT OUR STAFF JUST BECAUSE THEY HAPPEN TO DISAGREE WITH YOU.
02:32:19.446: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
02:32:21.881: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I'M NOT INSULTING STAFF. I JUST FRANKLY, FRUSTRATED THAT GETTING THE FACTS PUT OUT THE A EAR COHERENT FASHI H BEEN VERY DIFFICULT F ME O MYSELFHE VOTEN 2019 IN THEH MIDDLE OF THIS MEETING. OKAY. I'M SOR. I D'T THINK THATHOULD HAV EN NECESSARY FE. H TO KEEPOMING BK AND CLARIFYING STATEMENTS THAT WERE MADEASED ON INFORMAON THAT I'M  CARUL O ACCUSINGNEDTO BE NE OTHERS OF DOING WRONG THINGS, BUT IT WAS FRUSTRATING FOR ME TO BE HERE TRYING TO CLEAR THE DISCUSSION. I DID NOT DIRECT MY COMMENTS TOWARDS YOU, COUNCILMEMBER GRAND. BUT IT'S BEEN VERY HARD AND FRUSTRATING FOR ME, EVEN WITH MY CONVERSATIONS WITH MR. CRAWFORD ABOUT GETTING THIS AMENDMENT TO A POINT OF CLARITY. IT'S JUST BEEN IMPOSSIBLE TO GET THIS BUT TOUT THERE IN A CLEAR AND CONCISE WAY, ESPECIALLY IF I CAN DO IT, I'M SURE ALL OF YOU CAN AS WELL. AND I'M SORRY IF YOU FEEL OFFENDED, BUT MY COMMENDS WERE NOT DIRECTED TOWARDS YOU OR ANYBODY. I DON'T THINK IT SHOULD BE THAT HARD TO DIG UP ARGUMENTS AND FACTS THAT ARE BASED -- IN OUR RETREAT, YOU SAID LET'S MAKE OUR ARGUMENTS BASED IN FACTS AND DATA ANDENCE SO ON.AND I TRYINGE SWIMMING UPSTREAM.
02:34:21.000: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
02:34:22.202: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WANTED TO CLEAR UP A COUPLE OF THINGS. I THINK WE HAD SOME MISSTATEMENTS OF FACT HERE. ONE IS THAT THE TOTAL FUND BALANCE IN THOSE THREE FUNDS, WATER SUPPLY, SEWER AND STORMWATER IS $55 MILLION AND NOT BILLION. AND WE HAD A CALLER AND YOU ONLY HAVE SO MUCH TIME TO SPEAK, THEY TALK ABOUT THE RAISE IN OM 20 -- I'M ACTUALLY BELOW THIS. WE'RE A FAMILY OF FOUR AND WE USE ABOUT 17 OR LESS, CCF, BUT 18 WAS THE METER THAT WAS PUT IN OUR COUNCIL QUESTIONS HERE AND IT WENT FROM AROUND $31 TO $44 FROM 1990 TO 2015. WELL, THAT'S ALL WELL AND GOOD BUT THEN FROM 2016 TO 2021, WE HAD AN INCREASE EVERY YEAR AT LEAST 6%. AND SO THAT STOPPED SHORT OF EXPLAINING WHY NOW WHEN PEOPLE OPEN THEIR BILLS THEY EMAIL ME AND SAY WHAT? I THINK THAT ONLNL TO TH WAR USAGE, BED CCF AND NOT THE CUSTOMER SERVICE FEES AND ALL OF THESE OTHER THINGS. AND SO I JUST -- I'M JUST CAUTIONING PEOPLE TO TEMPER THEIR APPROACH TO WHAT IS THE REAL IMPLICATIONS OF SOMEBODY WHO SAYS ON A FIXED INCOME AND IT'S OKAY FOR ME TO -- OKAY, WE WILL GIVE ANOTHER $50,000 TO BARRIER BUSTERS AND TURN AROUND AND CREATE $50,000 WORTH OF NEED IN THE BARRIER BUSTERS PROGRAM AGAIN.NKING WATT OUR WATER RATES I JUST SEEMS NOT LIKE MAYBE THE BEST SOLUTION ALTHOUGH I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT THAT EXISTS OUT THERE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THE AGE AND JUST TO SPEAK WHAT COUNCILMAN RAMLAWI SAID EARLIER. I MAY BE THE LEAST FINANCIALLY WELL OFF OF EVERYONE HERE ON COUNCIL AND THAT'S NEITHER HERE NOR THERE. I MEAN WHEN MY FAMILY HAS OCCASIONALLY IN THE PAST FELL CITY, BECAUSE I KNOW THERE AREE PEOPLE THAT ARE WORSE OFF THAN WE ARE. I'M REASONABLY ABLE TO GO WORK STILL, AND, YOU KNOW, THAT'S JUST -- I WOULD NEVER USE BARRIER BUSTERS MYSELF, AND I'M GLAD IT EXISTS BUT I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE TEMPTED TO CREATE SITUATIONS WHERE WE SEND MORE PEOPLE TO THESE COUNTY RESOURCES, THE RESOURCES OF LAST -- COR SORT OF A LAST DESPE ATTEMPT TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM TRAGIC OUTCOMES AND I JUST -- I' NOT I THINK ONE HAND DOESN'T KNOW WHAT THE OTHER HAND IS DOING. IT'S JUST HOW I'M GOING. I KNOW WE SPEAK ON A BODY. NO OFFENSE TO THE STAFF WHO SAYS THEY NEED IT BUT I CAN'T SUPPORT IT.
02:37:06.132: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
02:37:07.033: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I THINK THAT A LESSON LEARNED FROM THIS IS SOMETHING THAT A CONSTITUENT END US IN AN EMAIL WHO SAID THAT SHE SUPPORTED THE WATER RATE INCREASE, BUT WE REALLY DON'T MARKET AT PUBLIC TO THE EXTENT THAT WE NEED TO. AND  MONTH OFF FORWARD IF WE CAN LOOK AT SORT OF AN EXECUTIVE SUMMARY, JUST A VERY SIMPLE TOOL SO THAT EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS IT. WE SPENT CONSIDERABLE TIME TRYING TO GET ON THE SAME PAGE. AND SO IF THAT COULD BE DONE -- PEOPLE EXPECT TO BE -- NOT ONLY EDUCATED BUT WE GET -- THERE'S SUCH A H MARKE EFFORT OUT THERE RIGHT NOW, THAT WE HAVE COME TO EXPECT SOME OF THAT. AND THE OTHER CONCERN THAT I HAVE, THAT I WOULD LIKE STAFF TO CONTINUE TO LOOK AT, IS THE FOURTH TIER AND SO I BELIEVE THAT'S DISCRIMINATING AGAINST LARGE FAMILIES. WE USE THE HOUSEHOLD UNIT BUT WE DO NOT USE NUMBER OF PEOPLE -- AND I UNDERSTAND THE DIFFICULTY OF DOING THAT. I ALSO THINK SOMETHIN THAEEEEETO UNDERSRSND M OFFING FORWARD AND WE CAN'T SIMPLY DEMONIZE PEOPLE THAT ARE IN THE FOURTH TIER WHERE THEY ARE SPENDING 14 TIMES AS MUCH PER UNIT. AND SO I REALLY WANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT BETTER. AND UNDERSTAND WHO IS IN THAT CATEGORY ESPECIALLY LARGE HOUSEHOLDS. THANK YOU.
02:38:56.109: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS.
02:38:57.143: >> Councilmember Briggs: THANK YOU. I JUST WANT TO, FOR MY PART TO SAY, I APPRECIATE STAFF'S QUICK AND CLEAR RESPONSES TO THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE ASKED NI THINK THERE WAS AAMOUNT O CLE QUESTION AND THE DISCUSSION THROUGHOUT THE EVENING. AND I ALSO CARE DEEPLY ABOUT MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY THAT ARE STRUGGLING. I THINK THAT'S WHY' UNANIMOUSLY AS A BODY APPROVED RATES TO INCREASE FUNDING TO BARRIER BUSTERS. THAT'S ONE ACTION WE CAN TAKE AND WE TK UNANIMOUSLY TONIGE T N OUR COMNITY BUT THE REALITY IS THAT, FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, ONE OF OUR BASIC RESPONSIBILITIES IS TO CARE FOR OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AND TO MAINTAIN IT. AND AS UNCOMFORTABLE AS IT IS TO RAISE RATES, ESPECIALLY DURING A PANDEMIC, THAT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY. IT WAS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THOSE THAT CAME BEFORE US AND IT WILL BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THOSE WHO COME AFTER US TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE FUNDS IN PLACE TO -- TO SUPPORT OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AND THAT DOESN'T HAT W DON'T CARE FOR OUR COMMUNITY. MEA WE CARE DEEPLY FOR OUR COMMUNITY AND SO I WISH THERE WAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO NOT RAISE RATES, BUT I DON'T -- I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THAT IS FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE AND I ALSO DON'T BELIEVE THAT -- YOU KNOW, I APOIAPOLOGIZE I COULDN'T SUPPORY COLLEAGUE'S AMENDMENT TO POSTPONE THAT VOTE, BUT FOR MYSELF, THE DEBATE WAS REALLY AROUND AM. I LO AM I LOOKING FOA POLITICAL WIN OR A SUBSTANTIVE DIFFERENCE WOULD I SUBSTANTIALIVELY CHANGE MY VOTE. I WOULD VOTE IN A COUPLE OF MONTHS FOR THAT RATE INCREASE AS WELL, BECAUSE THE INFORMATION THAT IS PROVIDED TO US SUGGESTS THAT IT'S IMPORTANT AND NECESSARY. SO IF I COULD PROVIDE THAT STABILITY AND PREDICTABILITY FOR STAFF TONIGHT AND PREDICTABILITY AND STABILITY FOR OUR COMMUNITY TONIGHT, I'M COMFORTABLE WITH DOING THAT. ayor Taylor: COUNCI ilmember Song:WANTED TO POINT TN NOVEMBER, WE HAD MR. LOTTIE GIVING US A REPORT ON BARRIER BUSTERS AND WHEN THIS CAME UP, I HAD ALSO ASKED JOHN FORNIER TO SHARE HOW MANY ANN ARBOR RESIDENTS HAD REQUESTED SPECIFICALLY WAIVING WATER -- YOU KNOW HAVING DIFFICULTY WITH PAYING WATER BILLS, AND HE SAID RENTS, IS 11 TOO MAN I THINK IF WE ARE GOING TO TK OUT TH DIFFICULTIES PRESENTED TO US BY THE PANDEMIC, WE HAVE ALREADY HAD IT POINTED OUT TO US BY STAFF, THAT DESPITE THE 2.6 TIMES INCREASE, WHICH IS A COUNTYWIDE PROGRAM IN ANN ARBOR, IT WAS 77 REQUESTS OR 77 ANN ARBOR RESIDENTS, AGAIN THAT'S 77 TOO MANY. I JUST WANT TO -- I WANT TO GIVE SOME CONTEXT, IHIO UNDERSTANDING THE STRUGGLES THAT WE ARE SPEAKING TO AND THE EXTENT THAT WE ARE TRYING TO ASSIST FOLKS. WE ARE NOT JUST THROWING ADDITIONAL MONIES TO BARRIER BUSTERS AND LEGISLATIVE WAYS AND HOW OTHER CITIES ARE ADDRESSING THIS, RIGHT? SO LATER ON, WHEN WE HOPEFULLY ENDORSE THE WATER SHUTOFF PROTECTION ACT, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD HAD SPOKEN TO, THAT THAT LEGISLATION, THAT STATEWIDE LEGISLATION SPECIFIEST INFORMATIOISRED TO BE IN SHUTOFF NOTICESND GIVING SUFFICIENT NOTICES TO FOLKS AND IT ACTUALLY ACCESSING THIS ASSISTANCE. I HOPE FOLKS ARE THINKING OUTSIDE OF -- I KNOW WE REPRESENT FOLKS HERE IN ANN ARBOR, BUT OBVIOUSLY FOLKS ARE HURTING HERE THROUGHOUT OUR COMMUNITY AND OUR COMMUNITY EXTENDS BEYOND ANN ARBOR FOR THE FOLKS WHO WORK HERE AND GO TO SCHOOL HERE AND DON'T NECESSARILY LIVE IN OUR BOUNDARIES. I APPRECIATE THE CARE THAT HAVE SPOKEN TO AND FOUND WAYS TO SUPPORTOLKS AND I WANTED TO ADD SOME NUMBERS TO THAT BECAUSE THAT WAS A CONCERN OF MINE AS WELL. THANKS.
02:43:37.924: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION  OF THE MAIN MOTION? I TOO AM GOING TO SUPPORT THE MAIN MOTION. IT IS -- LIKE I SAID IN THE UP FRONT, WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO LEAVE OUR WATER SYSTEM BETTER THAN WE FOUND IT. WE ALL KNOW THAT WE HAVE PORTIONS OF OUR WATER SYSTEM THAT ARE HUNDREDS OFEARS OL O0 YEA OLD. WE KNOW THAT ORATIVE PORTION OF THE WATER TREATMENT PLANT WERE BUILT IN THE 1930s. WE KNOW THAT WE ARE SEEING NEW CONTAMINANTS THAT WE OURSELVES WANT TO REMOVE FROM OUR DRINKING WATERS. WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE NEW CONTAMINANTS THAT NEW REGULATIONS WILL REQUIRE US TO REMOVE FROM OUR DRINKING WATER. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE DISTRIBUTE DRINKING WATER EFFICIENTLY, THAT W DO SO IN A SAFE MANNERND THAT ITEQUIRES AND WE CAT DO TT WITHOUT,NT PLA. U KNO RAISING RATES AND THAT THE ONLY W TO DO IT PRUDENTL TO TODAY'S RESIDEN AND FUTUR RESENTSND TT'S AND SO I WILLOVE FWARD AND RTHEISCUION?E MAI MOTN.D -- ROLL CALL VE, PLEASE, STAING WITH COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.

02:56:37.968: >> May Taylor: GOOD EVENING, WELCOME BA. C- AN ORDANCE TO AMENSECTIONS 16.6.D, 5.17, 5.17.6.C, 5.26.AND 5.28.8, A TABLES 5.15, 5.15-2, AND 5.15-3 OF CHAPTER 55 (UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE) OF TITLE V OF THE CODE OF THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. MAY IAVE A MOTION, PLEASE. MO BY COUNCILMEMBER DISCH, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI. DISCUSSION OF C-1. COUNCIL MEMBER HAYNER.
02:57:20.445: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANKS, MR. MAYOR. I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND MOVE THIS ON TO SECOND READING. I WANTED TO GIVE STAFF A HEADS UP THAT I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS. MY QUESTIONS THIS SESSION DID NOT GET SENT. THEY WERE WRITTEN BUT NOT SENT. I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ON, THIS ESPECIALLY AROUND MATERIALS L SECTION 517.6. C, IT SAYS THAT WE ARE GOING TO REGULATE THE USE OF FIBER CEMENT AND MIXED USE AREAS AND SO ON, AND, I MEAN, JUST AS LIKE ONE OF MY QUESTIONS AROUND THAT, BUT, I MEAN, I DON'T NEED TO TAKE UP COUNCIL TIME WITH THESE QUESTIONS, BUT THAT WAS ONE OF MANY QUESTIONS I HAD. THAT WAS LEFT FIELD. I THOUGHT WHY IS THAT THE CASE? LIKE, IF IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT HTC ALLOWS FIBER CT A HISTN THETORIC DISTRICTS. I KNOW WE HAVE SEEN SOME BUILDINGS THAT ARE NOT SO HOT, WHERE THEY USE HARDY PANELS AND IT DOESN'T LOOK FINISHED. THE CEMENT, THAT'S ONE OF THE MANY QUESTIONS I HAD ON THAT. I WILL FORWARD THAT ON TO STAFF AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET THEM ANSWERED. I GUESS MY BIGGEST CONCERN IS WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE A LOT OF SMALL CHANGES TO UDC PANE WE HAVE SOME EXCELLENT EXAMPLES -- AND WE HAVE SOME EXCELLENT EXAMPLES OF WHERE WOULD THIS BE APPLIED AND WHATI? ONCERN IS THAT GENERALLY, WITH THESE TYPES OF CHANGES THAT THE EXAMPLE GIVEN IS DECENT AND MAYBE THE NEXT FEW CHOICES ARE, BUT THEN WE HAVE NOT FORESEEN DOWN THE ROAD MIGHT HAPPEN, EITHER WITH THE LOOSENING OF REGULATIONS OR UNWITTINGLY RESTRICTING REGULATIONS AND IT WILL HAVE SOME NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCE MS.. I THINK THESE SMALL CHANGES, EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE SMALL CHANGES THEY ARE NUMEROUS AND NEED A MORE THOROUGH LOOK. FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? C-1 IS APPROVED. C-2. AN ORDINANCE TO ADD A NEW SECTION TO 5.19, AMEND SECTIONS 5.19.1 TABLE 5.19-1, IN SECTION 5.19.2, SECTION 5.19.3, AND SECTION 5.37.2.E, AND TO ADD A NEW SECTION 5.19.11 OF CHAPTER 55 (UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE) OF TITLE V OF THE CODE OF THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER RWI, BY COUNCILMEMBER DISCH. DISCUSSION OF C-2. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
02:59:59.504: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: JUST, I'M IN SUPPORT OF THIS ITEM HERE. I WANTED AMPLIFY THE CONCERNS OF MY CONSTITUENTS AND OTHERS, WHO WELCOME THE EV CHARGING STATIONS AND ELECTRICAL WAYS OF GETTING AROUND, BUT UNFORTUNATELY AT TIME, WE ARE STILL BURNING DIRTY FOSSIL FUELS TO PRODUCE THAT ELECTRICITY THAT'S POWERING THESE CARS. AS WE ALL FEEL COMPELLED TO SUPPORT THESE, WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO AS MUCH AS WE CAN TO STOP THE PRODUCTION OF ELECTRICITY FROM FOSSIL FUELS BECAUSE IT'S JUST GREENWASHING THE PROBLEM, MAKING US FEEL LIKE WE ARE ACTUALLY DOING SOMETHING, WHEN WE ARE JUST EXPORTING OURLO DIFFERENT ZIP CODE. SO I -- UNFORTUNATELY WHEN IT COMES TO SOME OF THE SOCIAL JUSTICE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE, THE ECONOMIC SOCIAL JUSTICE ISSUES, THIS IS ONE THAT I THINK NEEDS SOME ADDITION PAID TO IT, BECAUSE THE POORER PEOPLE ON THIS EARTH ARE THE ONES WHO ARE SUFFERING THE MOST AND, YOU KNOW, AGAIN WITH THIS KIND OF TECHNOLOGY AND THINGS, THAT WE'RE JUST -- AS IF WE ARE PRESSING A BALLOON, WE ARE PRESSING THIS SOMEWHERE ELSE. I KNOW THAT'S FOR A DIFFERENT DAY. THANK YOU.
03:01:45.977: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER DISCH.
03:01:47.345: >> Councilmember Disch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
03:03:00.418: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
03:03:01.719: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANKS. I GUESS MR. LENART, YOU ARE GOING TO ANSWER THIS EVEN THOUGH MR. DELACOURT IS LISTED ON THE AS THE S WHEN SITUATION WHERE WE ARE REGULATING ELECTRICAL VEHICLE PARKING, WE HAVE AUTHORITY TO DO THAT BECAUSE PARKING IS THE LEFT TO THE CITY'S DISCRETION UNLIKE STATE BUILDING CODES WHERE WE ARE HESITANT TO -- OR HAVE APPEARED HESITANT. I'M NOT, BUT WE HAVE AS OF YET FAILED TO REGULATE ALL ELECTRIC BUILDINGS S. THAT BECAUSE OF THE DIFFERENCE IN THE LEEWAYYDEVELOP VERSUS THE BUILDING ITSELF?
03:03:46.731: >> YES, GOOD EVENING MAYOR AND COUNCIL, I'M BRETT LENART, THE PLANNING MANAGER. THAT'S CORRECT, YOUR ASSERTION IS ACCURATE, THAT WHEN WE START TALKING ABOUT REQUIREMENTS FOR HOW AND WHAT UTILITIES MAY BE PROVIDED TO A BUILDING, THAT IS GOVERNED BY MUNICIPALITIES AND WE HAVE SOME REGULATIONS. THE NUMBER OF PARKING SPACES AND THE NATURE OF THOSE PARKING SPACES IS REGULATED . SO WE AIT MORE FLEXIBILITY TO PROVIDE PARAMETERS AND REQUIREMENTS FOR PARKING AND THE TYPE OF PARKING THAT'S PROVIDED UNDER THE ORDINANCE.
03:04:25.003: >> Councilmember Hayner:  SO WE HAD A MS. MITCHELL WHO IS ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION WRITE US AND ENCOURAGE US TO WRITE INTO THIS THAT THE GENERATION -- SOME OF THE GENERATION PARTIALLY COMES FROM SOLAR PANEL SITUATION OR ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SITUATION. SO IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WE ARE ABLE TO DO IN THE FUTURE WITHOUT MUCH DIFFICULTY TO MODIFY THAT THE FUTUREULD I DONE NOW?
03:04:51.563: >> I THINK -- I DON'T PROFESS TO BE AN EXPERT. WE DON'T TALK ABOUT THE POWER. WE RECOGNIZE THE SAME THING AND I RECOGNIZE IT'S NOT BINDING BUT IN THE ACTUAL ORDINANCE, CERTAINLY SOLAR RENEWABLE SOURCE FOR POWERING THE CHARGERS IS ENCOURAGED, BUT IT'S NOT REQUIRED.
03:05:16.654: >> Councilmember Hayner:  OH, OKAY. THANK YOU.
03:05:18.256: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER USSION FAVOR[CHOAYES] OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. C-3.

MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRAND AND SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER DISCH. I'M SORRY. EYER. MY APOLOGIES. ANY DISCUSSION OF C-3? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
03:05:59.597: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANKS, MR. HAYNER, I WILL BE ASKED TO TO BE RECUSED FROM A VOTE ON THIS, AS I HAVE A TANGENTIAL INTEREST IN THE OUTCOME OF THIS PROPERTY. SO I WILL ASK YOU TO RECUSE MYSELF FROM A VOTE ON THIS. I WILL ANSWER QUESTIONS IF IT SEEMS NECESSARY. I SPOKE WITH MR. POSTEMA ABOUTT.
03:06:28.059: >> City Atty. Postema: WHEN YOU SAY FINANCIAL INTERT IN E PROPTY, I THINK IT'S TANGENTIALLY RELATED TO THE MATTER WHICH IS RELATED TO THE PROPERTY. YOU HAVE NO OWNERSHIP IN THE INTEREST OF THE PROPERTY.
03:06:38.069: >> Councilmember Hayner: THAT'S CORRECT. I DO NOT. BUT IT AFFECTS -- YOU MIGHT WANT TO EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT MORE, YOU KNOW, WHAT --
03:06:49.247: >> YOU HAVE SOME INTEREST IN --
03:06:50.515: >> Councilmember Hayner:  THIS IS SIMILAR WHAT HAPPENED TO ME ON BRISTOL RIDGE, YOU MAY RESULT. BRISTOL RIDGEN PONTI TRAIL WHERE MY SHOAS LOCATED AND WHEN I WAS GENTRIFIED FOR THE THIRD TIME OUT OF FIVE YEARS, MY STUFF ENDED UP OVER AT THIS ELLSWORTH PROPERTY. WHERE THERE IS A -- THEY CALL IT THE WAREHOUSE. THERE'S THREE LOCKED GARAGES ON THE PROPERTY AND SO I MOVED SOME OF MY LARGE EQUIPMENT OVER THERE AND IF THE -- THE SOONER THIS MOVES FORWARD, THE SOONER I'M T.D SO MMAED THAT WAS LEGITIMAT UNDER COUNCIL ETHIC RULE TWO TO RECUSE MYSELF FROM A VOTE BECAUSE I JUST FEEL LIKE I DO HAVE -- IT WILL AFFECT WHAT HAPPENS TO ME.
03:07:44.802: >> City Atty. Postema: WELL, I THINK --
03:07:46.137: >> Councilmember Hayner:  IT COULD HAVE A FINANCIAL EFFECT.
03:07:48.106: >> City Atty. Postema: I THINK YOU STILL NEED TO BEXCUSED BY THE COUNCIL AND TALK ABOUT RECUSING THEMSELVES AND THAT'S NOT -- BUT I THINK YOU LAID OUT UNDER COUNCIL ETHICS TWO THE FINC.
03:08:04.622: >> Councilmeer GraI MOVE.

03:08:08.726: >>ayor Taylor: DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? COUNCILMEMBE HAYNER, YOU ARE EXCUSED. FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MN MOTION.
03:08:18.369: >> Councilmember Radina: THANK YOU, M MAYOR AND THANK YOU TO STAFF, F TAKING TIME EARLIER THIS WEEK T CHAT WITH ME AND CONCERNS I HAD ON THIS PPOSAL. M CFORTABLE AT THIS POINT MOVING THIS FORWARDN THE PROCS SO WEAN GAIN SOME PUB LYPUIC INPUT A CONTINUE OUR DISCUSSIONS ON THIS. PROPOSED DELOPMENT THAT ULD BE A COUE OFOOTBALL FIELD AWAY FRO MY HSE. D I HAVE BEEERY INVESTE ANINLV IOMMUNITY CONVERSATIONS AROUND THIS FOR SOMETIME. A NUMBER OF THE CONCERNS THAT I HAD INITIALLY REGARDING STORMWATER RUNOFF AND SOME OF THE IMPACT ON THE BUFFER ZONE BETWEEN THE PROPERTY AND THE NEIGHBORS FOREST HILLS COOPERATIVE,E ALLIATED BY SOME OF THE CONVERSATIONS THAT I HAD AND THESTS BEING MADE TO ENSURE THAT -- THE EFFORTS BEING MADE TO ENSURE THAT THIS IS HAVING LITTLE TO NO IMPACT ON THE NEIGHBORING COMMUNITIES. SO I'M COMFORTABLE MOVING IT FORWARD, ALTHOUGH I DO WANT TO SAY THAT THERE'S STILL SIGNIFICANT CONCERN WITH SOME OF THE NEIGHBORS IN THE COOPERATIVE COMMUNITIES AND I THINK INCREASED CONVERSATION WITH THEM WOULD BE VALUABLE SO THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE NOT OVERLOOKING ANYTHING IN THE NEXT FEW  BEFORE THIS COMES TOS FOR APPROVAL. THANK YOU.
03:09:49.227: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
03:09:50.127: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, MAYOR. AND THANKS TO THE WARD THREE REPS FOR ADDRESSING SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT THE RESIDENTS HAVE BROUGHT FORWARD IN TERMS OF THE STORM RUNOFF AND THE BUFFER AREA WITH THE CO-OP. SO I APPRECIATE THE HELP IN THAT. I HAVE HAD SOME QUESTIONS RAISED ABOUT THE TAXATION ON THE PROPERTY WITH THE A AORDA ING UNITND I WE'LL HAVE SOME TIME TO GET ANY QUESTIONS BEFORE OUR NEXT AND FINAL VOTE ON THIS MATTER IF IT DOES PASS HERE TONIGHT AND IT DOES HAVE MY SUPPORT AT FIRST READING AND MOST LIKELY WILL AT SECOND READING AS WELL. IT'S NICE TO SEE A PUD BE USED IN WAYS THAT WAS INTENDED AND WITH THE BENEFITS THAT THIS PROVIDES. I'M NOT SURE IF ANYONE IS HERE TONIGHT, IF THEY CAN ANSWER, IT BUT WITH THEORDABL HOUSING UNIT THE DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT, I'MRY I DIDN'T GET THROUGH IT ALL, WHETHER THERE IS TAX ABATEMENT OR A PILOT, PART OF THIS DEVELOPMENT WHEN IT COMES TO THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS.
03:11:04.001: >> City Admin. Crawford: MAYOR, I CAN CONFIRM THAT WHEN WE GO THROUGH THE COUNCIL QUESTIONS, BUT THEY MAY QUALIFY FOR THE LO BU WILL VALIDATE THAT AS WE GO THROUGH THE QUESTIONS ON THIS ITEM FOR NEXT MEETING.
03:11:31.295: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
03:11:32.229: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. I WANT TO THANK RESIDENTS AND STAFF AND KNOW THAT THERE HAG RS BEEN INTEREST IN THE ADJACENT CO-OP AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO THAT CONVERSATION IN THE INTERVENING MONTH. BUT ONE OF THE COMPETTING THINGS ASIDE FROM THEUNITS O AFFORDABLE SENIOR HOUSING WHICH IS THE MOST COMPELLING PART OF THIS DEVELOPMENT IS THAT THE DEVELOPER WAS -- MADE CHANGES IN THE INTERVENING MONTHS. THEY OF MONT MOVED WHERE THE ENE IS, AND THEY RECITED THE BUILDING SO THAT IT'S AS FAR AWAY FROM THE CO-OP AS POSSIBLE. THERE'S SOME CLEANUP THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. THERE'S ADDITIONAL ACCESSIBILITY AND THROUGH THE WOODS THAT COECTSO SCHOORO SO DO THINK THERE'S SOME ADDITIONAL BENEFITS. ONE THE NEIGHBORS HAD ASKED ME VERY EARLY IN THE PROCESS, PLEASE DON'T CUT DOWN THE GIANT TREE IN MY BACKYARD, WHO LIVES IN THE CO-OP. AND NOT A SINGLE ADJACENT LANDMARKED TREE IS GOING TO BE REMOVED THAT'S ADJACENT TO THE FOREST HILLS COOPERATIVE. AND THEN RELATIVE TO THE EXISTING SINGLE FAMILY ZONING WHICH HAS A MUCH SMALLER BUFFER, THIS DEVELOPMENT ALSO OFFERS MORE THAN TWICE THEATIVBUHAT WEE SINGLE FAMILY VOTING. AND SO IT'S ACTUALLY BETTER IN TERMS OF THAT BUFFER AS WELL AS -- SO NOT JUST FOR AESTHETIC REASONS AND ECOLOGICAL REASONS BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF THE AMOUNT OF IMPLICATION PERVIOUS SURFACE WITH SINGLE FAMILY HOMES IF IT WERE TO BE BUILT UNDER THE EXISTING ZONING. SO I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF BENEFITS. I ALSO KNOW THAT HAVING A DEVELOPMENT FOR SENIORS THAT IS SO CLOSE TO A SCHOOL, ESPECIALLY ONE THAT SERVES, IT'S OUR ONLY K- -- OR I GUESS YOUNG FIVE THROUGH THREE SCHOOL -- OR THROUGH TWO SCHOOL IN THE CITY, AT BRYANT ELEMENTARY THAT I HOPE THERE WILL BE SOME OPPORTUNITIES FOR COLLABORATION BETWEEN LOCKWOOD AND THE SCHOOL BECAUSE THERE MAY BE SOME RETIRED FOLKS WITH LOTS OF TIME AND WILLINGNESS TO SERVE SOME OF THE YOUNGEST MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY AND I KNOW THE DEVELOPERS EXPRESSED AN INTEREST IN THAT. SO THANK YOU AGAIN TOTAFF, AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONVERSATION IN THE NEXT MONTH AND HOPEFULLY BRINGING THESE UNITS, IT'S JUST TREMENDOUS. SO THANKS.
03:14:17.428: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? C-3 IS APPROVED. C-4. AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND CHAPTER 55 (UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE), ZONING OF 0.9 ACRE FROM P (PARKING) TO C3 (FRINGE COMMERCIAL), 2111 PACKARD STRE. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRAND, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER DISCH. DISCUSSION OF C-4? COUNCILMEMBER DISCH?
03:14:53.898: >> Councilmember Disch: YES, JUST QUICKLY, THIS IS A PRETTY EXCITING PROJECT. THE IDEA IS IT'S 2111 PACKARD ROAD AND IT'S TO BUILD A 72-UNIT THREE-STORY APARTMENT BUILDING WHICH WILL BE A MIX OF STUDIO, ONE-BEDROOM AND TWO-BEDROOM APARTMENTS AND IT'S ON ATIONONOL SITE THAT'S CURRENTLY ZONED FOR PARKING AND SO WE ARE UNPAVING PARADISE AND WE ARE TURNING CAR STORAGE INTO HUMAN STORAGE, WHICH I THINK IS A GREAT DIRECTION FOR US TO MOVE IN. SO THERE IS ALSO A $45,000 -- NOT MILLION, NOT BILLION, BUT THOUSAND CONTRIBUTION TO THE PARKS FUND AND THERE'S A SOLAR ELEMENT. THERE WILL BE ROOFTOP SOLAR AND IT HAS A LOT THINGSN THE ENERGY E WOULD LIKE T SEE, AS WELL ASETAIL SPACE. SO IT'S A MIXED USE HOUSING THING, RESIDENTIAL ADDITION TO OUR COMMUNITY AND I'M EXCITED ABOUT IT.
03:16:04.835: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
03:16:05.703: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, MAYOR TAYLOR. JUST FOR BETTER CLARIFICATION, AND FORCE WHAT IS GOING ON HERE. I'M PRETTY SURE MOST OF US DO KNOW BUT JUST FOR THE PUBLIC AND OTHERS IN THIS PROCESS HERE NOW, STAFF COULD HELP US WALK THROUGH THIS PROCESS, WHERE WE ARE REZONING THE PARKING TO THE FRINGE COMMERCIAL IN THIS INSTANCE, BUT THERE WILL BE OTHER MOTIONS NECESSARY BY COUNCIL -- ACTIONS TAKEN BY COUNCIL FOR THE DEVELOPMENT THAT COUNCILMEMBER DISCH JUST SPOKE ON; IS THAT CORRECT?
03:16:40.704: >> YES, THAT'S CORRECT. THIS IS THE -- THE SITE IS SPLIT ZONED. IT IS -- THE SOUTH PORTION IS ON PARKING AND THE NORTH SIDE IS -- THIS WOULD BE REZONE THE ENTIRE SITE TO COMMERCIAL, AND THEN THE CORRESPONDING ACTION WOULD BE, OF COURSE, SECOND READING OF THE PROPOSED REZONING AND THE CORRESPONDING SITE PLAN WHICH WOULD APPROVE THE DEVELOPMENT UNDER THAT COMMERCIAL ZONING DESIGNATION.
03:17:06.597: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  AND WHEN WOULD YOU EXPECT THAT SITE PLAN TO COME TO COUNCIL FOR CONSIDERATION?
03:17:15.940: >> I THINK THE 19th IS THE SECOND JUARY M M SO I WOULD ANTICIPATE ON JANUAR.
03:17:22.012: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, BRETT. I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS WITH ENTHUSIASM, AS WELL. IT IS AN AREA OF TOWN THAT COULD USE SOME REBIRTH. I DO HAVE A SMALL CONCERN, JUST BEING A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER MYSELF AND JUST SEEING ALL THE SMALL BUSINESSES WHO ARE CURRENTLY THERE, WHO WILL BE DISPLACED AND I UNDERSTAND THERE WILL BE RETAIL IN THE NEW DEVELOPMENT, BUT I CAN PRETTY MUCH GUARANTEE THAT THE RENTAL RATES ON THAT NEW DEVELOPMENT AND THE RETAIL LOCATIONS WILL BE DOUBLE, TRIPLE, PERHAPS QUADRUPLE WHAT THEY CURRENTLY ARE. SO HOPEFULLY THE PETITIONER WILL CONTINUE TO OPERATE WITH GREAT CARE AND CONSIDERATION AS THEY HAVE THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS. THE ENGAGEMENT, THE PUBLICENGAGO BEEN EXEMPLARY. THEY HAVE DONSTRATED EXLLEN IN TRYING TO GET COUNCIL A PROJECT THAT FITS OUR GOALS. THIS IS A SITE THAT'S ON A TRANSIT-ORIENTED LINE, EASY TO GET TO YOUR AMENITIES AS THE POLAR PANEL INSTALLATIONS AND MANY OTHER AMENITIES THAT REALLY MAKE THIS A VERY PROMISING AND POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT. SO I THANK, AGAIN, T TITIOR GNGOUGH ALL THEY HAVE TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE THEY ARE AT.
03:19:01.612: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND?
03:19:02.479: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. I WON'T REPEAT WHAT HAS BEEN SAID OTHER THAN I THINK THIS IS AN EXCITING -- IT'S ALMOST LIKE A CLEANUP OF THE ZONING IT FEELS LIKE TO ME, RATHER THAN A REZONING BECAUSE IT'S MAKING THE WHOLE THING CONSISTENT, BUT HAVING -- HAVING THAT EXTENSIVE PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT, THE PETITIONER HAS AN EMAIL LIST. SO EVERYONE WHO HAS BEEN TO OSTINGS GETSNFORMED OF WHEN THINGS ARE COMING TO COUNCIL, AND WHEN THEY WERE COMING TO PLAN. THEY CONTINUE TO MAKE THEMSELVES AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS. SO IT'S BEEN -- THEY HAVE MADE CHANGES ACCORDING TO FEEDBACK FROM THE NEIGHBORS IN TERMS OF HOW THE BUILDING IS SITED, THE DESIGN OF THE BUILDING. I LOVE THAT THIS BUILDING IS -- IT COMES UP AND INTERACTS WITH THE STREET AND IT HAS THE PARKING IN THE BACK, WHICH I THINK IS FANTASTIC. IT HAS BIKE AME. IT'S -- IT'S MIXED USE, THAT HAPNSLONG THE TRANSIT CORRIDOR AND REDEVELMENT OF A SITE. I THINK IT'S A LOT OF WHAT WE WANT TO SEE. I HOPE IN THE WEEKS AHEAD -- I KNOWHAT SOME OF THE NGHBORS STILLAVE A COUPLE OF CONCERN ABOUT JUST SOME OF THE DETAI OF THE THINGS -- A ABOUT THE PARKINAND THE TRAFFIC BUT IT'S A TRIFIC DMENT AND I'M PLEASED IT. GRISWOLD.Tlor: COUNCILMBER
03:20:34.338: >> Councilmember Griswold: YEAH, I WANTO REPEA THE EXCEENT PUBLI ENGAGENT AND SUGGT THAT MAYBE THIS PCESS COD BE A MODEL WHEREE WOULD BE USED BY OTHEVELERSTOU GOING FORWARD BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL.
03:20:57.828: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] ALL OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. DC-1 RESOLUTION TO DIRECT AMENDMENTS TO CITY CODE TO PROSPECTIVELY APPLY LOCATIONAL RESTRICTIONS TO SHORT TERM RENTALS. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER EYER, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER DISCH. DISCUSSION OF DC-1. YOU KNOW, I GUESS I WOULD LIKE TO KICK THIS ONE AND I WILL PUT A CLOCK ON MYSELF TOO. I WOULD LIKE TO KICK THIS OFF. THE -- AS FOLKS KNOW, WE PAS BACK WHEN -- AOU OF MONTHS AGO, A SHORT-TERM RENTAL ORDINANCE, WHICH RESTRICTED AND PROHIBITED -- WHICH SOUGHT TO PROHIBITED NON-OCCUPIED SHORT-TERM RENTAL USES IN THE CITY. THIS IS TO ADDRESS, AZ AS NARROY AS POSSIBLE THE PREEXISTING, NONOWNER OCCUPIED SRT USING. THIS REQUEST RECOGNIZES WHAT I BELIEVE TO BE FTSOPEN THE GROUNT THERE ARE NONOWNER OCCUPIED UNITS IN THE CITY, REGISTERING AND HAVE BEEN INSPECTED AS RENTSAL PROPERTY UNDER THE CITY'S HOUSING ORDINANCE FOR YEARS, AND THAT THEY HAVE BEEN OPERATING IN A MAN ERR CONSISTENT WITH WHAT HAS BEEN OUR ORDINANCES. YOU KNOW? AND CONSISTENT WITH THE CONCERNS THAT I RAISED ABOUT OUR ORDINANCE BACK WHEN, I BELIEVE THAT WE AS A CITY COULD AND SHOULD PASS A MORE TAILORED ORDINANAE WIL EXPANSION OFONOWNE OCCUPIED SHORT-TERM UNITS BECAUSE TOO MANY IS NOT GOOD FOR THE COMMUNITY, I THINK, BUT THAT WOULD BRING CURRENT UNITS, CURRENT UNITS ALREADY ALREADY IN USE, OPERATING ON THE GROUND AND BRINGING THEM UNDER GREATER REGULATIONS AND CONTROL, AND AN ORDINANCE THAT WOULD TAKE THESE STEPS IN A WAY THAT RECOGNIZES THE EXISTING FACTS ON THE GROUND. THAT IS TO SAY THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE OPERATING UNDER -- AND HAVE BEEN OPERATING AND ACTS IN RELIANCE ON OUR PREEXISTING EXISTINGREGULATORY FRAMEWORK. IN MY VIEW, THE PROPOSED CHANGES OR THE REQUESTED CHANGES TO STAFF ARE NARROWLY TAILORED AND IN MY VIEW USEFUL TO AVOID WHAT I THINK IS CERTAINLY UNWELCOMED AND DISRUPTIVE AND POSSIBLY LOSING LITIGATION IN AN AREA THAT IS -- IT'S JUST UP NECESSARY. I THINK THAT THE PROPOSED PROHIBITION, RATHER THE EXISTING PROHIBOES VIOLENCE TO EXISTING PEOPLE'S EXPECTATIONS, AND VIOLENCE TO THEIR -- THEIR ONGOING EXERCISE OF THEIR -- OF THEIR RENTAL OF THEIR PROPERTY AS HAS ABOUT AND THAT WE CAN AND OUGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY IS OPERATING IN A MANNER THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH GOOD NEIGHBORLINESS AND THEY ARE CONDUCTING THEY WILLSELVES IN A MAN -- THEMSELVES IN A MANNER PROPER, BUT THAT WE HAVE ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO DEAL WITH DISRUPTIVE NEIGHBORS WITH DISRUPTIVE PERSONS AND THAT WE SHOULD RELY UPON THAT TO SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS. COUNCILMEMBER EYER.
03:24:34.111: >> Councilmember Eyer: THANK YOU. I WILL BE BRIEF. TWO THINGS THAT I WANTED TO MENTION TONIGHT. I MEAN, I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS. I HAVE SAID FOR MANY MONTHS, THAT I DO BELIEVE WE NEED TO REGULATE THE SHORT-TERM RENTALS WITHIN OUR COMMUNITY, BUT I THINK WE NEED TO DO SO WITHIN THE CONFINES OF EXISTING LAW. AND, YOU KNOW, WHEN WE CREATE ORDINANCES AS CITY COUNCILMEMBERS, IT'S MY VIEW THAT WE NEED TO DO SO IN A WAY THAT BALANCES VARIOUS NEEDS IN THE COMMUNITY AND DOES NOT PUT THE CITY AT FINANCIAL OR LEGAL RISK. I THINK IT'S OUR DUTY TO BE GOOD FINANCIAL STEWARDS OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS. THE OTHER POINT THAT I WANTED TO MAKE WAS THAT -- OR RATHER JUST CONFIRMATION FROM STAFF IF I COULD, THAT THEY WILL BE LOOKING INTO THE QUESTIONS AROUND HOW TO FURTHER DEFINE NUISANCE ISSUES. IN THE ORDINANCE THAT WAS PASSED, IT'S DISCUSSED AND MENTIONED THAT A LICENSE CAN BE REVOKED, IF THE NUISANCE -- AND I'M WONDERING IF WE WILL HAVE FURTHER GUIDANCE AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HOW WE CAN MAKE THAT -- THAT HAPPEN, IF AND WHEN IT DOES HAPPEN, BECAUSE WE HAVE -- WE HAVE HAD INSTANCES OF CERTAINLY WHAT SOUNDS LIKE PUBLIC NUISANCES IN NEIGHBORHOODS.
03:26:13.477: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. DELL ACORT, MR. McDONALD?
03:26:15.278: >> I WOULD BE GLAD TO TAKE A SHOT AT THIS, BUT I WILL ASK THE ATTORNEY'S OFFICE TO POTENCHIME. THE NUANCE-RELATED ISSUES, THE CITY ALREADY HAS ORDINANCES ON THE BOOKS THAT DEAL WITH NUANCE-RELATED ISSUES. IF THERE IS A -- WE CAN INVESTIGATE WHETHER IT'S THE POTENTIAL TO TIE NUISANCE-RELATED ISSUES TO RENTAL CERTIFICATES, BUT THAT'S NOT SOMETHING WE DO NOW REGARDLESS OF WHETHER IT'S A SHORT-TERM RENTAL OR WHETHER IT'S A REGULAR LENGTH LEASE AND WE EXPERIENCE THE SAME NUISANCE ISSUES AS STAFF AND NUISANCE MPTER IT'S A SHORT-TERM RENTAL OR A LONG-TERM RENTAL. MY SUGGESTION IS IF WE DO THAT, WE LOOK AT IT HOLISTICALLY AND NOT ONLY IN CONNECTION WITH THE SHORT-TERM ISSUES. AND THAT THOSE NUISANCE-RELATED ISSUES BE CONSISTENT ACROSS THE BOARD. THE ABILITY TO DO SO, I KNOW, IT'S DIFFICULT TO REGULATE NUISANCE ISSUES THROUGH ZONING, ZONING AND/OR THE LICENSING ISSUES WHICH WE ARE LOOKING AT HERE. IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT COUNCILWE RECOMMENDATION ON IT, THAT WOULD BE A SEPARATE PROCESS, I THINK.
03:27:31.955: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
03:27:32.923: >> Councilmember Hayner:  OH, THANKS, MR. MAYOR. YEAH, I ACTUALLY DOESN'T SUPPORT THIS FOR AVA A VARIETY OF REASOS WAY BACK WHEN, AND THAT WAS BECAUSE I HEARD FROM MANY OF THE OWNERS OF THESE PROPERTIES THAT OR OPERATING AS NONOWNER OCCUPIED SHORT-TERM RENTALS THAT THEY PROVIDED A UTILITY THE COMMUNITY AND THEY WERE GOOD NEIGHBORS AND SO ON AND SO ON. I BELIEVE IT BECAUSE ESPECIALLY I KNOW SOME OF THEM WELL AND I HAVE SEEN THEIR PROPERTIES AND SO ON. BUT -- AND I THOUGHT THIS WENT TOO FAR. SO AREBUT BE THAT AS IT MAY, WED ZONING TO CONSTRUCT THESE RULES. EVERYBODY HAS TO BE TREATED EQUALLY AND SO NOT TO CONSIDER THAT WE MIGHT GO BACK AND SAY, WELL, MAYBE NOT, THAT WE WILL CARVE OUT SOME EXCEPTIONS IN OUR ZONING. IT SEEMS LIKE WE ARE PICKING WINNERS AND LOSERS A LITTLE BIT. I THINK THAT IN ITSELF WOULD LEAD TO POTENTIAL LITIGATION. THE NOTION THAT WE HAVE PULLED THE RUG OUT FROM CURRENT LAWFUL OPERATORS, YOU KNOW, WITH THAT ORDINANCE WAS ONE OF THE CONCERNS I EXPRESSED BACK THEN WHEN I DIDN'T SUPPORT IT. AND I THOUGHT, WELL, THAT WILL GET US A LAWSUIT, FOR SURE, YOU KNOW? AND, PERHAPS WE WOULD BE IN A BETTER SITUATION TO APPLY THESE KINDS OF RULES TO THESE OPERATIONS, YOU KNOW, THROUGH THE SETTLEMENT OF A LAWSUIT THAN THROUGH TRYING TO MANIPULATE ZONING TO CARVE OUT WINNERS AND LOSERS. I'M NOT SURE I SUPPORT THIS AND, YOU KNOW, I TRIED TO USE ON BEHALF OF THE CONSTITUENTS THE HOST TOOLS TO DEAL WITH PROBLEM PROPERTIES THAT WERE NONOWNER OCCUPIED PROPERTIES, ESPECIALLY A COUPLE ON SUNSET AND IT'S LIKE A FUTILE EFFORT. I HALF A DOZEN TIMES FOR THE SAME PARCEL TO DEAL WITH THE HOST PROVIDER IN THIS CASE AIRBNB, TO GET THEM TO ACT, TO SAY, LOOK, THIS IS A NUANCE PROPERTY AND ALL I'M LEFT TO DO IS SHRUG AND TELL THEM TO CALL THE POLICE AGAIN BECAUSE THE HOSTING SERVICE HAD NO INTEREST IN HELPING ME OUT WHATSOEVER. THEY HAD A VERY RAPID TURNAROUND ON THEIR CONCERNS. YOU HAD TO BE VERY SPECIFIC, AND IF YOU WASN'T THE TO LETTER OF WHATEVER THE COMPLAINT WAS, THEY WEREN'T GOING TO INTO IT AND EY SEEMED TO NOT BE INTERESTED. I THINK THIS IS A STRANGE PATH TO COME BACK AND SAY, WE USE ZONING TO CONSTRUCT THIS FOR A SPECIFIC REASON AND NOW WE WANT TO CARVE OUT EXCEPTIONS TO THE ZONING. I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT AND I DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE SUPPORTING IT.
03:30:16.119: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
03:30:17.854: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I WANT TO BACKTRACK AND CLARIFY A FEW FACTS THIS ORDINANCE THAT I HAVE SEEN CONFUSED IN THE LAST FEW DAYS. FIRST OF ALL, THIS ORDINANCE AS WE PASSED IT IN SEPTEMBER PERMITS RESIDENTS TO USE THE HOMES THAT THEY LIVE IN FOR SHORT-TERM RENTAL AS A WAY OF GENERATING SUPPLEMENTAL INCOME. SO ANYONE CAN USE THEIR PRIMARY RESIDENCE AS A SHORT-TERM RENTAL. THIS ORDINANCE IS SENSITIVE TO THE FACT THAT RESIDENTS NEAR TO DOWNTOWN AND CAMPUS PAY A PREMIUM TO LIVE THERE AND SHORT-TERM RENTAL INCOME IS HELPFUL. SECONDLY, NONOWNER OCCUPIED STRs ARE NOT PROHIBITED BY THE ORDINANCE THAT WESE SEPTEMBER. IT DOESN'T PROHIBIT THE INVESTMENT OF THE DEDICATED SHORT-TERM RENTALS BUT SUCH BUSINESSES MAY NOT EXIST IN RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS OF THE CITY. IF THERE IS A NEED FOR THIS BUSINESS MODEL AND OWNER OCCUPIED ARE NOT ENOUGH TO FULFILL THAT NEED I WOULD EXPECT THE INVESTORS TO PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO AREAS THAT ARE PROPERLY ZONED FOR IT. I THINK THIS IS A REASONABLE EXPECTATION. REGARDING THIS SPECIFIC AGENDA ITEM, ALL THE ARGUMENTS AGAINST IT ARE, I THINK, CLEAR ENOUGH AND HAVE BEEN STATED AT PAST COUNCIL MEETINGS. AND I DON'T NEED TO REPEAT THEM. OUR LOCAL ANN ARBORENANTS UNION AND DSA, INCLUDING A RECENT DSA CANDIDATE FOR COUNCIL OPPOSED THIS AGENDA ITEM FOR ALL THE OBVIOUS REASONS AROUND HOUSING AND HOW SHORT-TERM RESIDENTIAL UNITS DEPLETE THE LOCAL HOUSING SUPPLY AVAILABLE TO YEAR-ROUND HOUSING UNITS. RECENT COUNCIL CAMPAIGNS SETTLED ON THE IDEA THAT WE NEED MORE HOUSING IN THE CITY AND IF THOSE IDEAS WERE ANYTHING MORE THAN WO IHINK VOTSS RY STRAIGHTFORWARD. BETWEEN 100 AND 200 UNITS OFE USING. TO USE A TERM POPAR WITH I A FEW OF THESE UNITS WILL NOT BE BASED ON NIMBYS BUT IT'S OUR FAULT IF WE SUPPORT THE AMENDMES NO IS ORDANCE. TH'S ALL I HE TO SAY.
03:32:31.020: >> Mayor Tayr: COCILMEMBER RADINA.
03:32:32.255: >> Councilmeer Radina: F MANY OTHE REASONS TT YOU STATED A COUNCILMEMBERYER TOUPPO THIS SEASON. AND FOR A NUMBER OF THE REASONS CAERS ATHE BEGINNING OF COUNCIL TONIGHT, I HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH SOME OF THE PROPERTY OWNERS WHO ARE USING THESE FOR SHORT-TERM RENTAL PURPOSES. AND IN MANY I VIEW, THEY ARE PROVIDING, I THINK -- I THINK IT'S BEEN UNFAIR TO CHARACTERIZE THEM AS SIMPLY UTILIZING RESIDENTIAL AREAS FOR TOURISM PURPOSES. I DO BELIEVE I HAVRDCOMPELLING S WHO ARE REMODELING THEIR HOMES AND IT'S NOT REALISTIC FOR THEM TO MOVE INTO A HOTEL FOR A PERIOD OF WEEKS OR MONTHS. I HEARD OF FOLKS WHO ARE VISITING RELATIVES AT THE HOSPITAL AND SIMPLY WANT TO GO HOME TO A HOME AT NIGHT AND NOT A HOTEL. I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S STILL OTHER FACILITIES THAT COULD OPERATE AND SERVE THOSE PURPOSES, BUT I WOULD ACTUALLY REFER BACK TO SOMETHATUNCILMEMBR RKS WHICH IS DIRECTED TOWARDS THE FUTURE INVESTORS AND I AGREE. I THINK FUTURE INVESTORS SHOULD ABSOLUTELY BE LOOKING AT AREAS THAT ARE PROPERLY ZONED GOING FORWARD FOR -- FOR PURCHASING ADDITIONAL PROPERTIES TO USE FOR THIS PURPOSE. MY CONCERN IS ABOUT PUNISHING THOSE RESIDENTS WHO HAVE PURCHASES THESE PROPERTIES AND HAVE BEEN OPERATING THEM LEGALLY, AND WITHIN THE CONFINES OF OUR EXISTING LAW AND INVESTING IN THESE PROPERTIES AND MAKING IMPROVEMENTS ON THESE PROPERTIES FOR THIS PURPOSE AND THEN PULLING OUT THE FROMUNDERN. AND SO I SUPPORT CONTINUED REGULATION. I ACTUALLY WOULD ECHO COUNCILMEMBER EYER'S CALL FOR STAFF TO LOOK INTO SOME ENFORCEMENT, WHETHER THAT IS REQUIRED -- WHETHER WE NEED TO SIMPLY STRENGTHEN OR ADD ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE DEALING WITH THAT, I THINK ACTUALLY MANY OF THE GOOD ACTORS IN THE COMMUNITY WOULD SUPPORT THAT AS WELL. OR WHETHER OR NOT WE SIMPLY NEED TO STRENGTHEN OUR CURRENT ENFORCEMENT. AND I WOULD ALSO CALL ON US TO LOOK AT OTHER COMMUNITIES THAT HAVEMPLEMENTED KIN A HYBRID MODEL TO LOOK AT SOME OF THE PRACTICES AT WORK. I WOULD SAY WHAT IT'S WORTH, IT'S NOT MY PREFERENCE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH A SIMPLE GRANDFATHERING. I DON'T NECESSARILY SUPPORT THE IDEA OF CREATING A MONOPOLY FOR THOSE FOLKS WHO ARE CURRENTLY OPERATING. I WOULD LIKE FOR US TO CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THIS AS IT'S IMPLEMENTED AND TO MOVE FORWARD, BUT FOR MANY OF THE REASONS STATED BY THE MAYOR EARLI AROUND PROTECTING US FROM POTENTIAL LAWSUIT AND ALSO FRANKLY, I THINK DOING WHAT IS BEST BY THE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE BEEN RUNNING THESE SHORT-TERM RENTAL BUSINESSES IN GOOD FAITH AND LEGALLY FOR A PERIOD OF TIME, IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO. SO THANK YOU.
03:35:39.876: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
03:35:42.812: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. I HAVE A QUESTION AND -- AND SO MY CONCERN IS SIMILAR TO A LE OF THOSE STATED BY MY COLLBOUT THE GRANDFATHERING APPROACH, BUT THE QUESTION WAS NOT ASKED SPECIFICALLY WHY THE GRANDFATHERING APPROACH, VERSUS THE CAPPING APPROACH, WHICH I THINK MAYBE POTENTIALLY GETS US TO THE SAME PLACE WITHOUT PICKING WINNERS AND LOSERS IN EXACTLY THE SAME WAY THAT GRANDFATHERING JUST DOESN'T SIT AS WELL WITH ME. SO COULD I GET AN EXPLANATION FROM STAFF MAYBE OR S ELSE WHY WE WENWITH THE GRANDFATHERING APPROACH VERSUS HOW WE DID WITH THE MEDICAL MARIJUANA BUSINESSES PRIOR TO THE CHANGES WHERE WE -- WHERE WE HAD A CAP?
03:36:40.002: >> WELL, I THINK WHAT IS IN FRONT OF YOU IS A RESOLUTION FOR STAFF AND THE PLANNING COMMISSION TO GO BACK AND EXAMINE THAT. I DON'T BELIEVE AT THIS POINT WE ARE ACTUALLY MAKING A RESOLUTION AS THE BEST WAY TO GO FORWARD. THE BASIC DIFFERENCE IS GRANDFATHERING FOR LACK OF A TERM IF YOU TALK ABOUT IT IN THE TRADITIONALSE, WHS THE USE OFING ORDINAN,HICH WOULD CREATE PROPERTIES THAT WERE LEGALLY NOT CONFORMING AT THE TIME OF THE ADOPTION IS ACTUALLY THE TERMINOLOGY, THAT DOES CREATE A DE FACTO CAP IN HOWEVER WE DETERMINE THE PROPERTIES AT THE TIME OF THE ACTION. THAT WOULD BE THE CAP. WITH THE LEGAL NON-CONFORMANCE AS THEY INTO SHORT-TERM RENTALS AND CAN CONVERTS TO L RENTALS THAT RATCHETS DOWN AND THEN EVENTUALLY IN THEORY, YOU DON'T HAVE ANY MORE LEGAL NON-CONFORMANCE, AND HAVING A CAP, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE CAP WOULD BE. IF IT'S TO ALL THE ADDITIONAL OR CREATE A CAP THAT IS THE EXISTING OR AS THOSE BECOME CONFORMING ALLOW OTHER ONES TO A STANDPOINT, TRYING TO THOSESPM STAFF THAT TYPE OF CAP WOULD BE EXTRAORDINARILY DIFFERENT, WHERE PROPERTIES WERE CONSTANTLY CONVERTING AWAY IN AND OUT OF CONFORMANCE BASED ON THE LEASE TYPE AND THEN THE AVAILABILITY OF EXTRA NUMBERS UNDER THAT CAP AND HOW WE ASSIGN THOSE. TRUTHFULLY SITTING HERE TODAY, I HAVE NO IDEA HOW WE WOULD MANAGE THAT ENFORCE THAT. THE LEGAL NON-CONFORMANCE, WE ESTABLISH ONE LIST OF PROPERTIES AND AS THEY CONFORM, YOU CONVERT INTO SOME OTHERSE,HEN THAT DE FACTO CAP WA RATCHETS DOWN. THAT'S TWO POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS AND I THINK WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DORDO, IF COUNCIL WANTS TO CREAE SOME TYPE OF QUOTE/UNQUOTE GRANDFATHERING, WE EVALUATE THAT WITH THE ATTORNEY'S OFFICE AND ESTABLISH IT WITH THE PLANNING COMMISSION AND COME BACK AND MAKE THE BEST RECOMMENDATION ON HOW TO DO IT. I'M NOT EVEN SITTE SITTING HERET WE HAVE THE BEST WAY TO DO IF DN ON THIS TONIGHT. WE WILL NEED SOME TIME TO LOOK INTO IT.
03:39:17.693: >> Councilmember Grand: I APPRECIATE THE NUANCE. IT'S HELPFUL BECAUSE I GUESS MY INTENT IS THAT ANNOY, I HEARD ABOUT SOME STUDIES THAT SAID THIS HAS HAD AN IMPACT ON HOUSING AFFORDABILITY IN LARGER COMMUNITIES WHERE TOURISM IS A BIGGER PART OF THEIR ECONOMY AND THAT IN SMALL CITIES LIKE OURS, IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE HAVING AS BIG OF AN IMPACT AND THAT SEEING THE UTILITY OF HAVING AS WE HEAR FOR M PE, A SMALLER NUMBER OF THESE, I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE REGULATED TO DEAL WITH THE INITIAL CONCERN OF THIS, AND HOW THIS STARTED IN THE FIRST PLACE, WHICH WAS THE NUANCE CONCERN. SO THANK YOU. THAT'S WHERE THAT QUESTION WAS COMING FROM AND I REALLY APPRECIATE IT. THANKS.
03:40:02.471: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS.
03:40:03.472: >> Councilmember Briggs: THANK YOU. YES, FOR MY PART, I THINK THERE'S -- THERE WERE SOME QUESTIONS RAISED AROUND SORT OF POLICY CONSISTENCY, TERMS OF OUR VIEW POINTS ABOUT HOW WE MIGH BE ABLE TO SUPPORT AN ORDINANCE CHANGE OBVIOUSLY, I NEED TO SEE WHAT AND A HALF WOULD BRING FORWARD. EYE CONCERNED ABOUT A FEW ISSUES. ONE, OBVIOUSLY, THE CASE LAW IS ONE PIECE BUT I DO THINK THAT THERE IS SHORT-TERM RENTALS EVEN NONOWNER OCCUPIED, CAN PROVIDE BENEFIITHIN O O NEIGHBORHOODS LESS CONCERNED ABOUT HAVING THEM IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS. AND MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THE PROLIFERATION IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS AND WHETHER THAT TAKES THE FORM OF A CAP OR GRANDFATHERING -- THROW, GRANDFATHERING SEEMS TO MAKE MORE SENSE AND CONSISTENCY WITH OUR CASE LAW. I THINK A COUPLE OF ISSUES GOT RAISED AROUND IF WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT HOUSING AND BUILDING MOREOUSING ICOMMUNITY,E SUPPORTIVE OF THIS? I THINKF THE REQUEST HES AROUND HOUSING, THAT -- IF THE QUESTION IS AROUND HOUSING, HOUSING IS AN ISSUE OF WHETHER OR NOT THESE UNITS ARE LOCATED WITHIN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS OR WITHIN MIXED USE AREAS AND SO THIS CONSISTENCY WOULD BE TO LIMIT THEM ACROSS OUR COMMUNITY, IF THAT WAS OUR PRIMARY CONCERN ABOUT TAKING AWAY HOUSING UNITS. I THINK AT THE CORE OF THIS ISSUE REALLY IS A QUESTION OF WHAT IS APPROPRIATE IN OUR NEIGS. AND SO FOR M THEIECE TERMS  CONSISTENCY AND IT WAS SOMETHING THAT I- I CAMPAIGNS AROUND. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT OUR NEIGHBORHOODS BEGIN TO RETURN TO A TIME PERIOD WHERE WE CAN HAVE A MIX OF USES WITHIN THEM, WHERE WE HAVE NEIGHBORHOOD GROCERS, WE HAVE COMMERCIAL USES, OF A LIMITED NATURE WITHIN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS BECAUSE I THINK THEY ADD TO THEM. AND SO I THINK AS LONG AS THESE ARE PROPERLY REGULATES AND WE ADDRESS THE NUISANCE ISSUES THAT WERE PSE FROM A FEW BAD ACTORS I THINK WHAT WE ARE ADDING FROM OUR COMMUNITIES, AS WAS MENTIONED FROM CALLERS. I WOULD LIKE TO ASK STAFF AS THEY ARE WORKING ON THIS, THERE'S A STRONG PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT PERIOD, WHERE A LOT OF CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED ABOUT SHORT-TERM RENTALS WITHIN NEIGHBORHOODS, AND SOME OF THOSE -- THERE'S A VARIETY OF ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED AND IT MAY BE HELPFULO UERSTATIE FEE ALREADY ADDRESSED WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF OUR ORDINANCES AND WHICH ONES ARE NOT, BECAUSE I THINK FOR THOSE FOLKS DEALING WITH THE BAD ACTORS, PARTICULARLY AROUND THE STADIUM, WE MAY NEED TO THINK ABOUT CHANGES AND I'M JUST NOT SURE WHAT FORM THOSE TAKE.
03:43:26.976: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
03:43:28.143: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, MAYOR TAYLOR. I APOLOGIZE AHEAD OF TIME IF I I FEEL THAT THIS PIECE OFN I DO. LEGISLATION IS EFFECTIVELY A REGRESSIVE FORM OF PUBLIC POLICY. IT'S TAKEN US BACKWARDS. AND IN THE AREAS THAT I THINK ARE IMPORTANT, THE SOCIAL ECONOMIC JUSTICE. YOU KNOW, AND IT'S NOT -- THE ORDINANCE THAT WAS PASSED ON SEPTEMBER 8th NOT DRIVEN BY THAT. BUT IT WAS -- IT BENEFITED BY THE PASSAGE OF THAT ORDINANCE. THE DRI FORCE BEHIND THE SEPTEMBER 8thAS APPING OUR ORDINCE THE WAY IT'S WTTEN, IT SHOD BE ENFORCED. WATTAY CITY COUNC DID NOTTART THIS TH THE IA OF  OF,OU KNOW -- -- DON'T WANT TGO BACKWAS. I WOD RATHERALBOUTOING FORWAR HER A RES KES US BACKWARDS BECAUSE IT DOES TAKE AWAY HOUSING SUPPLY. IT DOES START PICKING WINNERS AND LOSERS. IT DOES CREATE MORE OF AN UNSTABLE CLIMATE LEGALLY, WHEN WE START APPLYING UNEQUAL APPLICATIONS OF THE ZONING ORDINANCE. I THINK THAT CREATES MORE ISSUES FOR US THAN WHAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE AND I KNOW THERE'S BEEN MANY INVESTORS WHO WANT TO CHALLENGE THIS ORDINANCE. AND THIS IS A BURGEONING DUSTRY. THIS IS A NEW INDUSTRY THAT JUST CAME ON OVER THE LAST FIVE OR TEN YEARS. GOVERNMENTSARE SLOW TO REACT AND WHEN WE APPLY OUR ZONING OR NAPS, WE COME DOWN TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THESE ARE NON-CONFORMING. IT'S NOT THAT WE CL CHANGE THE S IN THE MIDDLE OF IT ALL. WE STARTED APPLYING THE LAWS THAT WE WERE NOT APPLYING TO BEGIN WITH. THE LAWS ALWAYE. WE JUST WEREN'T A THEM. WE DIDN'T DO WT WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN DOING. AND NOW WE DID ON SEPTEMBER 8th. THEY ARE ALLOWED NO EXIST AND FOR THE FOLKS THAT WANT TO MOVE IN A SHORT-TERM RENTAL WHILE THEIR HOME IS BEING REMODELED, YOU CAN DO THAT. YOU JUST HAVE TO RENT IT FOR 31 DAYS. YOU CAN STILL THESE STRs IN SINGLE FAMILY ZONING FOR 31 DAYS AT A TIME. YOU JUST NEED TO LEASE THEM 31 DAYS. THAT'S ALL. AND WHEN PEOPLE TALK ABOUTNUISAY TIME ON COUNCIL AND ALL THE COMPLAINTS I GET FROM CONSTITUENTS TELLS ME, IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT EXPERIENCE TRYING TO ENFORCE OUR NUANCE LAWS. STAFF IS RELUCTANT TO DO IT. THE POLICE ARE RELUCTANT TO DO IT. IT'S A WHACK-A-MOLE CONSTANTLY AND I JUST THINK THIS IS JUST COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO OUR GOALS, AND, AGAIN, IT'S A STEP IN REVERSE. AND WHEN YOU HAVE A WORKING, WHE 24/7, AND RAISE THEIR FAMILY AND BE HERE, VERSUS AN INVESTOR WHO WILL JUST BUY THE PROPERTY, AND GET THE BEST --
03:47:06.862: >> Mayor Taylor: YOU ARE AT THREE MINUTES.
03:47:08.063: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  THE WORKING CLASS PERSON LOSES OUT.
03:47:13.502: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILWOMAN GRISWOLD.
03:47:15.170: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES, IT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING BEFORE THE LAST TIME WE VOTED ON THIS, THAT THE PATH FORWARD WITH THE MINIMUM AMOUNT OF RISK WAS TO HAVE THE COURTS ORDER SOME TYPE OF PROTECTION FOR THE EXISTING SHORT-TERM RENTALS THAT ARE IN RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY, THAT THAT WAS THE LEAST RISKY APPROACH. AND THAT WHAT IS BEING PROPOSED TONIGHT WOULD ACTUALLY INCREASE OUR LEGAL RISK. SO I'MDERING IF THAT POSITION CHANGED.
03:48:00.115: >> YOU KNOW, WE PROVIDED COUNCIL WITH WRITTEN ADVICE ON THIS.
03:48:04.419: >> Councilmember Griswold: RIGHT.
03:48:05.187: >> YOU KNOW, AND SO I'M GOING TO -- I WILL SIMPLY SAY THAT ADVICE STILL STANDS TODAY. I'M NOT SURE THAT IT'S CONSISTENT WITH WHAT YOU ARE SAYING RIGHT NOW. SO I WILL LEAVE IT AT THAT. I MEAN IF WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT THIS FURTHER IN CLOSED SESSION, WE CAN DO SO, BUT WE CAN'T GET INTO THE NATURE OF THAT ADVICE KIND OF ON THE FLOOR HERE.
03:48:28.977: >> Council Griswold: OKAY. AND MY LAST QUESTION IS, IF WE WERE TO GRANDFATHER THESE BUSINESSES IN, DO WE HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MANY OF THE SHORT-TERM RENTALS -- THE ONES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT, THAT ARE IN RESIDENTIAL AREAS, ARE SIMPLY ONE OR TWO UNITS OWNED BY, SAY, AN INDIVIDUAL VERSUS THE ONES THAT AREYAY TR MOREY AN AND I'M ALSO TOLD THAT THERE ARE SOME CORPORATE UNITS THAT ARE USED BY CORPORATIONS FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE COMING AND GOODING INTO THE COMMUNITY. SO DO WE KNOW WHAT THE MIX IS OF THESE UNITS THAT WE ARE CONSIDERING?
03:49:27.803: >> I DO NOT. NOT SITTING HERE TONIGHT DO I HAVE THAT INFORMATION.
03:49:32.307: >> Councilmember Griswold: OKAY. SO WE REGISTERED MOST OF THEM AS
03:49:34.910: >> WELL, AE'T DISCERN ON THE REGISTRATION RIGHT NOW, BETWEEN SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM. SO WE JUST HAVE RENTAL PROPERTIES. WE DON'T -- WE DON'T DISCERN BETWEEN TYPES BASED ON LENGTH OF LEASE. THAT WOULD START TO TAKE PLACE WHEN IT THE ORDINANCE TAKES EFFECT ON MARCH 1st.
03:49:53.795: >> Councilmember Griswold: OKAY. I UNDERSTAND THAT, BUT DO WE HAVE SOME UNITS OUT THERE THAT ARE NOT EVEN ON THE LEASE ROLLS? THAT'S WHAT I'M WONNG. SOSY I OPENED BY SOMEONE, BUTT'S NOT CONSERED THE PRIMARY RESIDENCE FOR TAX PURPOSES? BUT IT HAS NOT BEEN REGISTERED AS A LEASE?
03:50:24.726: >> I GUESS -- I GUESS I WILL TAKE A STAB AT THIS. PROPERTIES THAT ARE HOMESTEADED, CROSS REFERENCED WITH YOU ARE RENTAL CERTIFICATES, IS THAT WHERE YOU ARE HEADED -- I GUESS I NEED SOME MORE CLARIFICATION OPEON THE QUE
03:50:41.944: >> Councilmember Grisw S,S C I'M WONDERING IF THERE ARE UNITS -- SAY WE COULD GRANDFATHER. COULD THERE BE UNITS THAT WE ARE GRANDFATHERING THAT WE DON'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT REGISTERED AS RENTALS? I THINK -- I THINK THE ANSWER -- I THINK THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS THE -- IF YOU DON'T MIND. MR. DELACOURT.
03:51:10.672: >>> NO, PLEASE.
03:51:11.073: >> IF I UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION CORRECTLY, I THINK THE ANSWER IS TO TRY. THERS S  A A TO RESTATE SOMETHING THAT DEREK SAID, RIGHT NOW THERE'S NO PLANS SPECIFICALLY FOR GRANDFATHERING OR PLAN AT ALL, BECAUSE THE STAFF IS GOING ON WHAT THE COUNCIL PASSED BEFORE, WHICH WAS THE ORDINANCE. SO UNLESS THIS PASSES AND IF THIS PASSES, THAT'S WHEN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THAT ORDINANCE WILL TAKE PLACE. IT MAY HAVE SOME GRANDFATHERING AND I THINK THAT'S WHY YOU SEE THE LANGUAGE SAYING THAT IF THE ZONING ORDINANCE NEEDS TO BE CHANGED, THEN SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE SENT TO THE PLANNING NING CHANGES.ND THAT MAY E ENTAIL GRANDFATHERING, BUT WHATEVER IT IS, IS TO BE KIND OF NARROWLY TAILORED TO ALLOW EXISTING USES TO CONTINUE. BUT IF THERE WAS GRANDFATHERING OR TO TRY TO GET IT LIMITING THAT UNIVERSE OF SHORT-TERM RENTALS, I THINK WE WOULD ACKNOWLEDGE THAT FOR A NONOWNER OCCUPIED SHORT-TERM RENTAL TO BE A LEGAL -- A LEGAL RENTAL IN THE CITY, THEN IT WOULDE THE CITY'ST HOUSING CODE, WHICH WOULD INCLUDE, A NONOWNER OCCUPIED UNIT, BOTH AN INSPECTION AS WELL AS A REGISTRATION. SO WE HAVE SOME -- A LIST WHICH AT LEAST WOULD START OUT WITH MAYBE THE UNIVERSE OF SHORT-TERM RENTALS AND SO I THINK WE WOULD LOOK TO TRY TO LIMIT SOMEONE WHO WAS NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH OUR CURRENT CODES. BUT THERE'S NOT -- IT'S NOT A SPECIFIC UNIVERSE BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW, YOU KNOW -- EVEN IF WE COUNTEDBERR THAERIS WE WOULDW HOW MANY WEREHORT-TM RENTALS VERSUS HOW MANY WE WOULD REPORT -- YOU KNOW, WE WOULD THINK WERE NORMAL RENTALS DOING 31 DAYS OR ABOVE OR ANY OTHER RENTAL DURATION.
03:53:11.693: >> Councilmember Griswold: THANK YOU.
03:53:15.030: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
03:53:15.897: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THIS FOLLOWS UP HOW THIS DIRECTIVE, I BELIEVE, MAKES OUR CURRENT SITUATION WORSE AND I KNOW THE CURRENT SITUATION IS NOT PERFECT. BIT.ORKED WITH STAFF QUITE A COME TO A DIFFERENT CONCLUSION BEFORE WE ADOPTED WHAT WE DID ON SEPTEMBER 8th. THE FACT OF THE MATTER WAS WE DIDN'T HAVE A BETTER CHOICE BASED ON EVERYTHING THAT WAS GIVEN TO US ON ALL THE INFORMATION THAT WAS AVAILABLE. AND NOW WE HAVE THIS ORDINANCE THAT IS SLATED TO GO INTO EFFECT ON MARCH 1st, AND NOW THIS COMES HERE TWO MONTHS PRIOR TO THAT, AND REALLY, DISTORT AND DDLES THE SITUATION AND MAKES IT VERY CONFUSING. WHAT HAPPENS TO THE ORDINANCE THAT WAS PASSED? DOES THAT GO INTO EFFECT AND THEN EVERYBODYD. BECAUSE I WAS WONDERING, HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE FOR STAFF TO COME BACK WITH THESE RECOMMENDATIONS? WE HAV HAVE ASKED A LOT OF THESE QUESTIONS BEFORE AND THERE WERE NOT A LOT OF ABOUT, GREAT ANSWERS BEFORE. I APPRECIATE THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE BROUGHT FORTH BUT MANY OF THESE SAME QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS WERE BROUGHT UP AND GONE OVER THERE, AND SO BACK TO THAT, WHEN IS THAT COMING BACK? BECAUSE THIS ORDINANCE GOES EFFECT MARCH 1st AND WHAT HAPPENS WHILE THI IS GOING ON?
03:54:42.784: >> WELL, I WILL TAKE A STAB AT THAT. WE HAVEN'T ISN SPENT A TON OF TE BECAUSE COUNCIL HAS NOT INDICATED THAT THIS IS A DIRECTION THAT THAT THEY WOULD E TO GO IN. WE TALKED ABOUT COMMONLY -- IT KEEPS BEING REFERRED TO AS GRANDFATHERING, EXISTING UNITS THAT ARE LEGAL OR TODAY, THAT THIS LICENSING ORDINANCE WOULD THEN DETERMINE TO BE NON-CONFORMING FOR LACK OF A BETTER TERM. WE WILL GO BACK AND DO OUR BEST TO TAKE THE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE THAT IS AVAILABLE, AUGMENT THAT WITH ANYTHING ADDITIONAL WE HAVE AND COME UP WITH A LIST OF HOW MANY THOSE ARE. ONESTHAT WE CAN TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITY VERIFY, OPERATED AS SHORT-TE, NONOWNER OCCUPIED RENTERS, PRIOR TO -- TO THIS ORDINANCE GOING IN EFFECT. THATA NNER TT WE WE BELIEVE BEST REFLECTS WHAT COUNCIL WANTS TO DO AND ALLOWING THEM TO EXIST IN PERPETUITY, BUT NOT AYOU LONG-TERMING THEM TO EXPAND TO PROPERTIES -- IF I'M UNDERSTANDING THE RESOLUTION THAT'S IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY TONIGHT. THE PROPERTIES NOT IN OPERATION PRIOR TO THAT DATE. WE WILL BRIHAT LIST BACK FOR NSIDERATION BY COUNCIL. IF WE DETERMI THE WESTAY TO OTE/UNQUOTE GRANDFATHER THOSE OFDC WE WIOTEATELY AT T PLANNG COMMISSION,ND IF WE ND ME TIME AND THAT REQUIRE US TO COME BK AND ASK COUNC TO PU BACK THE IMPLEMENTATN DATE O THE ORDINAN PREVISLY ADOPD, WE CAN CONSIDER THAT, OR THAT ORDINANCEAY VY WELL TAKE EFFEC UNTILHIS IS COMPLED. IF COUNCIL WANTS US TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS, THAT WILL BE SOME OF THE DISCUSSIONS WE HAVE WITH THE ATTORNEY'S OFFICE WELL, PART OHI ACTION,KNOW, TO N OF UNEQUAL -- YOU KNOW, THE UNEQUAL APPLICATION OF THE ZONING ORDINANCE AND DOES THAT CREATE A BIGGER PROBLEM THAN JUST THE COUPLE HUNDRED PROPERTIES CURRENTLY THAT ARE NON-CONFORMING? I MEAN, WE COULD BE INVITING BIGGER TROUBLE.
03:57:11.833: >> LET ME JUST ANSWER THAT. FIRST OF ALL, AS WE HAVE SAID, THERE'S --HERE'S -- TOES NOTREN. IT MAY LEAD TO A ZONING CHANGE, BUT AT LEAST IN ANY VIEW, IF -- I WILL JUST SAY THIS IF IT'S A GRANDFATHERING SITUATION, IT'S NOT -- THAT'S -- I MEAN THAT'S HOW ZONING CHANGES ARE MADE. ZONING IS CHANGED, AND IT CREATES USES ARE --
03:57:40.395: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I APOLOGIZE. WE DIDN'T CHANGE THE ZONING.
03:57:43.465: >> I'M SIMPLY SAYING, YOU KNOW, WE HAD SOME CONVERSATION DURING THIS DISCUSSION, ABOUT GRANDFATHERING.RING WOULD BE RO ZONING C AND IF THAT HAS CHANGED, THAT'S A CONSISTENT PROCESS BY WHICH YOU DETERMINE THAT CERTAIN USES ARE ALLOWED UNDER THE CURRENT ZONING. YOU MAKE A ZONING MODIFICATION AND ONCE THE ZONING IS MODIFIED, THOSE EXISTING USES BECOME NON-CONFORMING.
03:58:11.092: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  HOW DO WE GO RETROACTIVE WITH THIS? YOU GRANDFATHER THINGS THAT WERE THERE WHEN THE CHANGE HAPPENED. NOW WE ARE KIND OF GOING BACKWARDS WITH THIS APPLICATION OFRANDFATHER IN. CAUSE WE WILL BE CHANGING THE ZONING ORDINANCE AFTER WE ADOPTED THE ORDINANCE.
03:58:31.980: >> I'M NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION.
03:58:34.048: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  YOU ARE SEEING THE CHANGE IN THE ZONING ORDINANCE WITH WHAT HAPPENED AND THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR THE GRANDFATHERING IN TO OCCUR. I'M SAYING THAT THE ORDINANCE HAS ALREADY BEEN ADOPTED ON SEPTEMBER 8th AND NOW WE CHANGE THE ORDINANCE SIX MONTHS LATER THAT APPLIES TO THE ORDINANCE THAT WAS PASSED SIX MONTHS PRIOR. THE ORDINANCE ONTEMBER 8th I NOA ZONING ORDINANCE. IT WAS A LICENSING ORDINANCE. IT WAS A LICENSING ORDINANCE ONLY. THERE WAS NO ADDRESSING THE ZONING ORDINANCE AT THAT TIME.
03:59:06.681: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I'M SORRY, I'M NOW MORE CONFUSED. --
03:59:11.853: >> LET ME -- BECAUSE THIS HAS BEEN OUR RECOMMENDATION FROM THE BEGINNING. WHAT THE RECOMMENDATION HAS BEEN IS TO STRICTLY PROHIBIT NONOWNER OCCUPIED SHORT-TERM RENTALS WITHIN CERTAIN GEOGRAPHY IN THE CITY FOR LESS THAN 30 DAYS AND DON'T REQUIRE A ZONING ORDINANCE ABLE T D T THROUGHNSG ORDIN IT'S ALWAYS AND MORE RECENTLY TOWARDS ADOPTION OF THE ORDINANCE, COUNCIL'S QUESTION TO US WAS IF -- IF COUNCIL DETERMINED THAT THEY WANTED TO ALLOW ONES THAT WERE OPERATING LEGALLY AND EXISTING PRIOR TO THAT PROHIBITION IN PLACE, WHAT WOULD BE THE BEST TOOL TO DO IT. THE MOST COMMONLY USED TOOL TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT WOULD BE A CHANGE TO THE ZONING ORDINANCE. SO MY GUESS IS -- AND IN THIS INSTANCE, IF COUNCIL NOW WANTSSE PREVIOION NOT ASK STAFF TO CREATE THAT -- THAT EXCEPTION FOR LEGALLY OPERATING RENTAL PROPERTIES THAT WOULD NOW BE PROHIBITED. IF NOW AGAIN WE'RE HAVING THAT CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT, WITHOUT A TON OF ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATION, MY GUESS IS PROBABLY STILL AMENDING THE UDC TO DO WHAT IS NORMALLY THERE DONE IN THESES SITUATIONS AND THAT IS TO USE ZONING TO CREATE LEGAL NON-CONFORMANCE. WE MAY LOOK AT OTHER OPTIONS AND BRING BACK OTHER OPTIONS. AT THIS POINT, THE RESOLUTION IS ASKING US TO GO BACK AND FIND A WAY TO ALLOW THE EXISTING LEGALLY EXISTING SHORT-TERM RENTAL, NONOWNER OCCUPIED SHORT-TERM RENTAL TO EXIST POSTMARCH 1st. UP UNTIL NOW, THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT STAFF BASS HAND DIRECTED TO DO IF YOU WANT US TO GO BACK AND REVISIT THAT, AND I UNDERSTAND THERE ARE CERTAIN REASONS FOR THAT AND WE CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT AS STAFF, THEN WE WILL GO BACKND AT IT. MY GUESS IS THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT AND THE MOST COMMONLY USED TOOL WOULD BE TO AMEND THE UDC TO CREATE LEGAL NON-CONFORMANCE. IT'S A LITTLE UNUSUAL THAT IT'S USED AS YOU SAY RETROACTIVELY TO A NON-UCDC ADOPTED ORDINANCE, BT IT'S NOT UNHEARD OF IT AND IT'S A PRETTY STANDARD PRO E CESSNA PLANNERS AND CITIES USE TO CREATE NONRM -- LEGAL NOCONFORMI. SO, AGAIN, I HOPE THAT HELPS. IT IS A LITTLE BIT OUT OF ORDER. BUT IT'S -- IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE TOOL WE WOULD HAVE RECOMMENDED WHEN THE ORDINANCE WAS ADOPTED, IF THAT WAS THE CONSENSUS OF COUNCIL AT THAT TIME. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE TOOL AND THE DIRECTION WE MOST LIKELY WOULD HAVE RECOMMENDED AT THAT POINT. WE WERE LEAVING ROOM OPEN TO INVESTIGATE OTHER OPTIONS BY NOT BEING THAT SPECIFIC IN THIS RESOLUTION. BUT IN REALITY, MOSTIKELY BE THE PROCESS WE BROUGHT BACK FOR YR CONSIDERATION.
04:02:17.939: >> Mayor Taylor: IF I CAN GET ONE QUESTION IN. WHEN YOU SAY OUT OF ORDER, I THINK YOU MEANT OUT OF SEQUENCE RATHER THAN OUT OF ORDER.
04:02:31.486: >> CORRECT. CORRECT.
04:02:33.888: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILWOMAN GRISWOLD.
04:02:35.023: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WANT TO PROVIDE SOME RELIEF TO THE EXISTING SHORT-TERM RENTAL OWNS WHO HAVE PROPERTY IN NTIAL AREAS, HOWEVER, I DON'T SUPPORT WHATEVER THIS RESOLUTION IS RECOMMENDING AND I DON'T THINK ANYONE REALLY KNOWS WHAT THE OUTCOME MIGHT BE. SO I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING THIS, BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT A COURT RULING TO PROTECT THE EXISTING SHORT-TERM RENTAL OWNERS IS A SAFER APPROACH FORWARD. SAFER IN EAR TERMS OF PROVIDES S PURSUEHIS RESOLUTION AND SOME OUTCOME OF IT. SO ANYWAY, I JUST WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT I SUPPORT SOME TYPE OF RELIEF FOR THE PROPERTY OWNERS BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THIS IS THE WAY TO GO AND I -- IT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE WOULD BE -- THIS WOULD BE HANDLED BY THE COURTS.
04:03:42.857: >> I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED BY THAT BECAUSE YOU INDICATED THAT YOU EXPECTED THIS TO BE HANDLED IN A COURT RULING, BUT THAT WOULD BE AGAINS CY.WSUIT WAS FILED I MEAN, THAT WOULD BE THE RESULT OF A LAWSUIT FILED AGAINST THE CITY.
04:03:55.870: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES. AND I JUST BELIEVE THAT'S A CLEANER WAY OF DOING IT.
04:04:13.521: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. IF THIS INDEED PASSES -- I WILL START MY CLOCK. I WOULD BE GRATEFUL FOR LEGAL'S ANALYSIS OF -- OF ITS VIEW AS TO WHETHER OROT THE STA PROPOSED RESOLUTION -- THE STAFF PROPOSED ACTION IN RESPONSE TO THIS RESOLUTION IS A HIGHER LEGAL RISK OR A LOWER LEGAL RISK IN TERMS OF, YOU KNOW, LIKELIHOOD AND MAGNITUDE THAN WHAT WE CURRENTLY OPERATE UNDER. I GUESS FURTHER, I THINK BY WAY OF CLARITY, YOU KNOW, THIS IS -- YOU KNOW THIS IS A DIFFICULT ISSUE. AND IF WE WERE STARTING FROMH,WE THAT THE PEOPLE WHO WOULD VOTE IN NAV FAVOR, THEY WOULD WANT NONOWNER OCCUPIED SHORT-TERM RENTALS IN RESIDENTIAL AREAS. I'M AMBIVALENT AT IT. BUT WE ARE NOT STARTING FROM SCRATCH AND THE WORLD IS IMPERFECT. AND THE FACT IS THAT THERE ARE EXISTING USES AND THE FACT IS, YOU KNOW, MY VIEW THAT WE ARE AT -- YOU KNOW THAT THERE IS LEGAL RISKSSOCIATED HERE, AND THERE IS SLEMENT OF FAIRNESS RISK. D SO, YOU KNO I THINK THAT THIS IS AN IMPERFECT SOLUTION TO A PRESENT AND THE AVOIDABLE PROBLEM. AND SO IT DOES, I THINK, FIND A BALANCE WITH A DOWNWARD RATCHET AND I THINK WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THE HAND THAT WE ARE DEALT AND THE HAND THAT WE ARE DEALT IS EXISTING LEGAL USES INHESENTIAL. WITH THEIR ADMITD BENEFITS BUT ALSO WITH THEIR ADMITTED HARMS. WE FIND THAT BALANCE AND WE LIVE WITH THAT BALANCE, AND TO SUGGEST THAT THEY ARE PERFECT OR THAT THEY ARE ABHORRENT, I THINK DOES AN INJUSTICE TO THE COMPLEXITY THE SITUATION. FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING
04:06:30.625: >> Couil Griswold: GRISWOLD. NO.

04:07:05.126: >> Clery: MOTI CARRIES.
04:07:08.195: >> Mayor Taylo-2. RELUTION TO ADOPT CITY COUNCIL RULES FOLLOWING THE 2020 GENERAL ELECTION. MOVED BY GRISWOLD, SECONDED BY RAMLAWI. DISCUSSION, PLEASE, OF DC-2. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
04:07:24.612: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A COUPLE OF GENERAL COMMENTS AND DISCUSSION OF THE RULES AS THEY CURRENTLY EXIST. I GUESS MY GENERAL COMMENT IS WE HAVE THESE RULES BUT THEY ARE NOT ENFORCED AND SO WHAT GOOD ARE THESE RULES? NOW MY SPECIFIC COMMENT WOULD BE THAT WE HAVE SEVERAL THINGS IN THE RULES THAT IFE ADOPT THEM AS THEY EXIST, A ATTACHED TO THIS, THAT THEY -- THAT THEY DON'T SPEAK TO THE CURRENT SITUATION THAT WE HAVE BEFORE US HERE AT COUNCIL. AN EXAMPLE WOULD BE THE PUBLIC SPEAKING RULES. RULE NUMBER ONE, ALL PUBLIC SPEAKERS MUST SPEAK FROM THE PODIUM. WELL, CLEAR WE'RE NOT SAKING FROM A PODIUM. ARE WE ASSUMING THAT WE HAVE A VIUAL PODIUM TT ISENDED ACROSS THE GBE? OR SHOULD WE INTERPRET THAT TO MEAN THAT IF O WAS,AY, RESIDENTF THE COUNTY OR THE STATE OR WHATEVER, THATHEY ARE ALLOWETO SPEAK FM THE VIRTUAPODIUM? 'RE GOG TO GO AHE ANDHAT COIDER ADOINGHESE RUL WITHOUT CLARIFYING SOME. THAT'S ONE OF MANY THAT ARE EXISTING IN THIS NEW SITUATION WE FIND OURSELVES IN HERE. AND SO I JUST -- I WANTED TO POINT THAT OUT. YOU KNOW, THAT'S ONE THAT SEEEE EXTRA PERTINENT LATELY. HAD THIN PREVIOUS COUNCIL MEETINGS. WE HAD PEOPLE CALLING FROM HALFWAY ACROSS THE PLANET OR WHATEVER. YOU KNOW, CLEARLY, WE DON'T HAVE A PODIUM ANYMORE. SO I WOULD ASK MY COLLEAGUES, HOW ARE WE GOING TO RESOLVE THAT BEFORE WE VOTE ON THESE RULES? WE NEED TO DEFINE SOME OF THESE THINGS. I SEE MR. POSTEMA WANTS TO SPEAK.
04:09:06.580: >> City Atty. Postema: WELL, I THINK THAT THE ISSUE IS -- I BELIEVE YOU SHOULD TAKE A LOOK AT ALL THE RULES AND I THINK THAT THAT'S BEING DONE THROUGH THE ADMIN COMMITTEE AND WILNG U. THE ADOPTION OF THESE RULES WILL NOT PRECLUDE CHANGES -- WHATEVER, YOU WANT IN THEM. THE FACT THAT THEY ARE NOT FULLY APPLICABLE IN THE SENSE OF NOT A PODIUM, THAT'S BEEN ADDRESSED UNDER STATE LAW, ABOUT HOW VIRTUAL MEETINGS CAN TAKE PLACE AND SO THOSE COULD BE INCORPORATED AS YOU GO TO ACCOMMODATE THOSE TYPE OF THINGS. BUT I DO THINK THAT YOU NEED TO. AND SO IT IS, YOU KNOW, A STARTING POINT AND I THINK TO MAKE ANY CHANGES, I THINK THEY COULD COME AS SOON AS, YOU KNOW, EVEN NEXT MONTH, THEY COULD COME IN SOME FORMAT. AND SO I THINK A RULE LIKE THAT IS A RULE OF REASON THAT YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH, BUT IF YOU ARE ASKING, DO YOU WANT TO CHANGE THE RULES AND HAVEE RESIDENTS ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE UN OR WHATEVER CAN SPEAK, THOSE ARE THINGS THAT I WOULD HAVE TO WEIGH IN ON SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE THOSE ARE LIMITATIONS ON -- THOSE ARE LIMITATIONS IN ONE WAY ON SPEECH. ON THE OTHER HAND, ISSUES THAT TALK ABOUT PUBLIC COMMENTARY RESERVE TIME AT THE BEGINNING, I ADVISED YOU BEFORE THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT YOU COULD MODIFY, DEALING WITH ITEMS ON THE AGENDA. FORMAT, BUT IT ALSO AYOU LONG-TERMS PEOPLE TO, IN ONE RESPECT, TALK ABOUT ANY OTHER MATTERS NOT ON THE AGENDA. SO THOSE ARE ALL THINGS I WOULD ENCOURAGE THE PROCESS THAT'S GOING FORWARD TO DEAL WITH AND IF YOU HAVE SPECIFIC CONCERNS TO SEND THEM TO THE ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE AND THEN IT WILL COME TO THE WHOLE COUNCIL. IT WILL NOT BE DONE BY THE ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE. THEY WILL SIMPLY LOOK AT SOME AND IT WILL COME BACK FOR WHOLE COUNCILLLLLLLF THESE AND I THINK THAT THAT'S A GOOD PROCESS, RATHER THAN PICKING AND CHOOSING TONIGHT AND TRYING TO AMEND ON THE FLY. IN FACT, I THINK IT WOULD BE -- ORDERLY, YOU WOULD PROVIDE ADVANCED NOTICE SO ANY CHANGES YOU PROVIDE ADVANCED NOTICE.
04:11:49.410: >> Councilmember Hayner: SINCE YOU ANSWERED THE QUESTION, WOULD YOU OPINE ON THIS MATTER THAT'S LONG BOTHERED ME, AND I ASSUME IT'S GOING TO COME UP IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE WE HAD PEOPLE WHO ARE ANXIOUS TO MOVE THESE MEETINGS ALONG. WHEN A MOTION TO CALL THE PREVIOUS QUESTION -- THE M TO CALL THE QUESTION RUIRES A CONCURRING VOTE OF THREE-QUARTERS OF MEMBER PRESENT. THAT'S EIGHT AND A QUARTER PEOPLE IF THERE'S 11 PEOPLE, IS EIGHT OR NINE?
04:12:18.505: >> City Atty. Postema: IF IT'S EIGHT AND A QUARTER, IT WOULD BE -- IF IT'S A FRACTION, IT GOES UP. AND, AGAIN, WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THAT BEFORE. I THINK SOME OF THOSE NUMBER ISSUES NEED TO BE ADDRESSED, BECAUSE THEY DON'T WORK OUT AS PRECISELY. AND  I A NUMBER OF THINGS CAN BE ADDRESSED IN THE RULES CHANGE. I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THEY WILL BE WHOLESALES RULE CHANGE, IT'S NOT FOR ME TO SAY. OBVIOUSLY, THE RULES COMMITTEE IN THE PAST DID LOOK AT THINGS. THERE HAVE BEEN CHANGES AND THIS IS AN EVOLVING DOCUMENT AND SO I THINK YOU NEED TO LOOK AT WHAT WORKS FOR THIS BODY IN OUR PRESENT TIME AND THAT -- THAT WILL TAKE A LITTLE TIME, BUT I THINK  B HEALTHY YOU, AND IT WIL IDENTIFY SE  THE ISSUES THAT YOU HAVE RAISED AS CONCERN. AND SO I HAVE TOLD YOU THAT BEFORE AND I CONTINUE TO TELL YOU THAT I'M HAPPY TO ADVISE THE ENTIRE COUNCIL, THE ADMIN COMMITTEE OR ANYBODY ELSE ON THE RULES ISSUES.
04:13:34.581: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
04:13:35.482: >> Councilmember Griswold:  AS SOMEONE WHO IS WORKING ON, THIS I WANT TO SAY THAT I AM COMMITTED TO A VERY TRANSPARENT, ROBUST DISCUSSION THIS. I THINK WE CAN ALLGREEHAT IMPROVEMENT IS NEEDED. AND I JUST WANT TO TOUCH ON THE COUNCIL COMMUNICATION TIME AT THE BEGINNING OF THE MEET. ING. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT IT'S USED FOR MORE ON REPORTING OUT OF THE WORK OF COMMITTEES SUCH AS WHAT COU COUNCILMEMBER DISCHD TODAY. I THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT AND WE S ENPOWER OUR COMMISSIONS AND INCLUDE THEIR WORK AND RELATIONS IN WHAT WE'RE DOING AS COUNCILMEMBERS. AND LASTLY, I WOULD JUST SAY PLEASE REACH OUT TO ME IF YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS OR SUGGESTIONS THAT YOU WANT TO SHARE BEFORE THE FORMAL PROCESS FOR DOING THAT.
04:14:36.510: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER EYER.
04:14:37.544: >> Councilmember Eyer: THANK YOU, MAYOR TAYLOR. AS WAS MENTIONED IN THE WORK SESSION LAST WEEK -- BUT I WANT TO STATE I AGAIN, THOSE WHO MAY BE WATCHING AND FOLLOWING ALONG. COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD AND I ARE WORKING ON SOME NEW RULES CHANGES. WE HAD A GREAT MEETING A WEEK AND A HALF AGO NOW, AND WE'RE VERY MUCH ON THE SAME PAGE ABOUT THE THINGS THAT WE WERE EACH PROPOSING. AS COUNCILWOMAN GRISWOLD SAID, WE WELCOME ALL COUNCILMEMBERS TO REACH OUT T US AS WE APU TOGETH. THEREBE DISCUSSION AT THE MIN COITTEE MTING ABOUT THIS AND THEN A ROBUST DISCUSSION AT THE COUNCIL TABLE BEFORE WE VOTE ON ANYTHING. SO I WANT TO REITERATE THAT THAT'S ALL IN THE WORKS TO. ME, THIS IS REALLY PER PERFUNKTY AND VOTING THROUGH ON THE EXISTING RULES THAT ARE PLACE IN BUT KNOWING THAT WE ARE WORKING ON SOME NEW THINGS THAT I THINK WE BOTH FEEL ARE GOING TO BE BENEFICIAL TO THE BODY AS A WHOLE.
04:16:04.498: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
04:16:06.533: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  IP THINK THIS IS A GOOD TIME TO -- I THINK THIS IS A GOOD TIME TO LOOK AT RULE TEN. I THINK WE HAVE GOT AND WHAT I FROM OBSERVING SOME OF THESE RULES, THE FIFTH BULLET POINT UNDER RULE 10 READS "DURING COUNCIL MEETINGS, MEMBERS S NOT SEND PRIVATE ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS TO OTHER PERSONS THAN STAFF." IT GOES ON TO SAY MORE. IT ALSO SAYS ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS SENT AND RECEIVED BY A MEMBER DURING A COUNCIL MEETING SHALL BE INCLUDED IN THE MINUTES, IT GOES ON TO SAY MORE. A MEMBER SHOULD NOT USE THEIR PERSONAL MOBILE DEVICE TO ANSWER CALLS OR SEND ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS VIA TEXT WHILE SEATED AT THE COUNCIL TABLE. IT ON TO SAY MORE. I WOULD LIKE TO STATE THAT AND NOT NECESSARILY MAKE ANY ASSUMPTIONS HERE HERE, BUT I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE REMINDED THAT PERSONAL DEVICES EVEN IN THIS FORMAT, SHOULD BE REFRAINED FROM BEING USED AND I WANTED TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE THAT STATEMENT.
04:17:18.705: >> City Atty. Postema: THAT IS CORRECT.
04:17:20.240: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED THIS IT'S APPROVED. DC-3. RESOLUTION TO ENDORSE HB 241, THE WATER SHUTOFF PROTECTION ACT. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER SONG, AND SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER EYER. DISCUSSION, PLEASE OF DC-3. COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
04:17:46.199: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES. I WOULD LIKE TO BE A COSPONSOR , WAREHOUSING HB-241, SOME WHICH IS A TOTALLY DIFFERENT BILL. IT NEEDS TO BE SB-241 IN ALL PLACES. AND THEN IT HAS PASSED THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE AND I'M TRYING TO FIND ON MY SCREEN, IT'S BEEN REFERRED TO THE GOVERNOR. IT WAS REFERRED THIS AFTERNOON AND THERE'S SOMETHING THAT WILL HAPPEN ON THE 23rd. AND SO I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S GOING TO BE A SIGNING CEREMONY MAYBE COUNCIL MEMBER SONG KNOWS.
04:18:29.943: >> Councilmember Song: I HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING. THIS HE THINK COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD, YOU HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THIS CLOSELY TOO. COUNCILMEMBER TRAVIS RADINA HAD ALSO BROUGHT THIS UP OVER EMAIL. WE HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THE WORK CAN SENATOR STEPHANIE CHANGE AND SENATOR JET IRWIN CAME IN ON THIS PARTICULAR LEGISLATION AND JUST TRYING TO ADDRESS WATER SHUTOFFS AND I DON'T KNOW IF FOLKS ARE FAMILIAR WITH E ORY THISARTICULAREFFORT, BUT INR ISSUED AN EMERGENCY ORDER REQUIRING RECONNECTION OF SERVICE TO RESIDENTS, WATER SERVICE, IT WAS TO PREVENT WATTURE SHUTOFFS AND -- WATER SHUTOFFS BUT WHEN THE SUPREME COURT RULED AGAINST HER ORDERS, ITAS UP TO THE LEGISLATIVE BODY TO OFFER THESE PROTECTIONS. SO THIS PARTICULAR BILL IS, I THINK, REFLECTIVE O A COMMUNITYD REALLY SPECIFIC WHERE IT PROTECTS SENIORS,AMIES WIT CHILDREN, PEOPLE WHO ARE SERIOUSLY ILL OR DISABLED, PREGNANT WOMEN FROM SHUTOFFS AND SPECIFIED INFORMATION REQUIRED TO BE IN -- AND WATER SHUTOFF NOTICES AND TIMELINES FOR SHUTOFF NOTICES TO BE COMMUNICATED. EVEN THOUGH OUR COMMUNITY, ANN OUR BARRIER BUSTER REPORTS HAVE INDICATED ISN'T VULNERABLE TO SOMETHING LIKE THIS, I HOPE IT'S A T TO HOW RIOUSL WATER RIGHTS AND WER USE AND WATER ACSS TO BE INUR COMMUNITY. SO THANK YOU FOR CONSIRING YOURUPPORT.
04:20:15.782: >> Mor Taylor: CNCILCOUNLMEMBER RADINA. R>> Councilmeer Radina: THA YO COUNC GRISWOLDOR POTING OUT T ERRORS THE. I AO EILED HER. I WAND T THANK COUNCMEMBER SONG FOR BNGINGHIS UP IN OUR POLICY COMMITTEE LAST WEEK, BEFORE THIS ACTUALLY PASSED BOTH CHANGE BETTERS. OBVIOUSLY WE ARE TO THAT POINT IN THE LEGIS SESSION WHERE MOVIN QUICKLY, I THINK IT'S STILL IMPORTANT FOR US TO PASS THIS TONIGHT AND TO DEMONSTRATE OUR SUPPORT FOR THIS AND THE WORK BEING DONE BY SENATOR CHANG WHO INTRODUCED IT BUT ALSO SENATOR IRWIN WHO REPRESENTS US IN HERE IN ANN ARBOR ON THIS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT ISSUE, AND I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A COSPONSOR TOO.
04:20:58.391: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
04:20:59.259: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK Y YOU. AND I APPRECIATE PUTTING SOME LIGHT ON. THIS UNFORTUNATELY, I THINK SOME OF OUR ACTIONS ARE GOING T THE NEED FOR THIS EVEN GREATER, AND ID TO BNG THI UP EARLIER. I APOLOGIZE, BUT THE QUALIFICATIONS FOR BARRIER BUSTERS IS THAT ONE MUST BE AT 50% OF AMI OR BELOW, AND I THINK THAT'S -- WE FORGET THAT THAT NOT ANYBODY AND EVERYBODY IS AVAILABLE TO GO TO BARRIER BUSTERS. YOU DO NEED -- YOU ARE DISQUALIFIED IF YOU MAKE ABOVE 50% OF AMI FROM BARRIER BUSTERST THERE WHILE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A RELATED MATTER AND APPRECIATE THIS AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING IT.
04:21:52.445: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
04:21:53.313: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANKS, I JUST -- I WANTED TO ASK IS THAT SECOND WHEREAS CLAUSE ACCURATE? IT SAYS WHEREAS ANN ARBOR HAS NOT EXPERIENCED AN INCREASE IN WATWATER SHUTOFFS, I DON'T KNOWF THAT'S TRUE OR THE NUMBER OF HOUSEHOLDS REPORTING WATER AFFORDABILITY TO THE UTILITY WHICH IS US AND ALL I WILL SAY ABOUT THAT IS I HAVE HAD A PERSONREASE I NUMBER OF HOUSEHOLDS REPORTING WATER AFFORDABILITY ISSUES TO ME AND SO I'M NOT CERTAIN THAT THAT IS COMPLETELY ACCURATE. IS THERE ANY WAY TO CHECK THAT? I MEAN, IT'S NOT SO GERMANE TO THE FACT THAT WE DO SUPPORT, YOU KNOW, WATER SHUTOFF PROTECTIONS IN THE STATE AND OUR CITY, INDEED, BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT THAT'S ACCURATE. ANYBODY WEIGH IN ON THAT?
04:22:45.332: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. CRAWFORD?
04:22:46.066: >> Councilmember Song: THIS IS SOMETHING I ASKED JOHN FORNIERNE S SG THAT. SO I DON'T KNOW IF MR. CRAWFORD CAN SPEAK MORE DIRECTLY TO THAT.
04:23:00.280: >> City Admin. Crawford: I CANNOT UNFORTUNATELY. MR. FORNIER WAS NOT ABLE TO JOIN US TONIGHT. SOME OF THAT IS HARD TO QUANTIFY, BUT SOME OF IT CAN BE. I MEAN WE DO KNOW HOW MANY PEP ARE ASKING FOR ASSISTANCE. NOW WHETHER THAT'S REPRESENTATIVE AS YOU HAVE INDICATED OF PEOPLE WHO EXPRESS FORWARDABILITY ISSUES TO YOU -- AFFORDABILITY ISSUES TO YOU OR OTHERS, BUT DON'T GO SO SEEK THEM. THAT WILL BE HARD TO ADDRESS THAT -- AFFORDABILITY APPLIED TO ONE -- YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE HAVE. WHEN YOU ARE STRUGGLING WITH RESOURCES, ANY BILL THAT COMES UP, ANY INCREASE OR ANY CHANGE IS VIEWED AS THE NEXT ONE THAT'S CAUSING THE PROBLEM AND SO SOME OF THIS IS HARD TO MAKE EXACT. I CAN FOLLOW UP WITH MR. FORNIER AND FOLLOW-UP ON WHERE SOME OF THESE NUMBERS CAME FROM.
04:24:01.841: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER SONG?
04:24:04.177: >> Councilmember Song: TO, I. JUST WANTED TO MAKE A CLARIFICATION. SO IF -- WHEN YOU CALL UNITED WAY'S 211 FOR ASSISTANCE, THAT'S -- THAT'S ASSISTANCE THAT'S PROVIDED TO ANYONE IN OUR COMMUNITY, REGARDLESS OF WHERE YOU ARE ON THE AMI OR WHETHER OR NOT YOU CALL QUALIFY FOR BARRIER BUSTERS THAT'S SUPPORTED BY UNITED WAY LOCALLY AND IF FOLKS HAVE FOLLOWED THEIR COVID RESPONSE WORK, WHICH HAS BEEN REALLY EXTENSIVE, YOUR ISSUES ARE ADDRESSED, WHETHER IT'S UTILITIES, RENT SAFETY, ABUSE. SO I WOULD HOPE THAT FOLKS WHO ARE IN DIFFICULT SITUATIONS WOULD STILL MAKE USE OF THOSE SERVICES AND NOT FEEL DESERVICES AGREEMENTED WHETHER OR NOT THEY -- DETERRITORIED WHETHER OR NOT THEY QUALIFIED FOR BARRIER BUSTERS OR NOT.
04:25:02.102: >> City Admin. Crawford: AND I WOULD JUST ADD THE RECENT REPORTS WE HAD, COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, FROM UNITED WAY HAVE INDICATED AN INCREASE HERE. AND I THINK WE HAVE A SLIDE FROM THEM THAT RECENTLY WAS SHARED. THAT'S A REALLY GOOD RESOURCE THAT COUNCILMEMBER SONGS REFERRING TO, THAT THEY ARE A GOOD AGO GREENWASHING HE GATOR OF THAT INFORMATION AND CAN PROVIDE -- AGGREGATOR OF THAT INFORMATION AND CAN PROVIDE YOU ASSISTANCE. RAM >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER BRINGING UP THE SECOND WHEREAS CLAUSE. PAGE 5 OF THE ANSWERS CLEARLY DEMONSTRATES AN INCREASING NEED BY FOLKS SEEKING ASSISTANCE. BASED ON THE INFORMATION THAT WE RECEIVED, I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A MOTION TO STRIKE THAT WHEREAS CLAUSE, BECAUSE IT'S FACTUALLY INCORRECT.
04:26:06.433: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE A SECOND? SECOND.
04:26:19.279: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  WE WOULD LIKE TO BASE OUR LEGISLATION IN FACT AND DATA AND BASED ON THE INFORMATION THAT WE ARIVING, THERE IS AN INCREASE IN NEED FOR THIS IS ASITTANCE AND WE NEED TO BE HONEST WITH OURSELVES. AND I THINK IT'S -- IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO PUT THAT, IN THIS CASE, AND STRIKE THAT SECOND WHEREAS CLAUSE, TO REFLECT THE REALITIES BECAUSE FRANKLY, THE DEMAND AND THE NEED IS INCREASING RIGHT NOW.
04:26:52.378: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCIL MEAN ARE A - COUNCILMEMBER RADINA.
04:26:59.953: >> Councilmember Radina: I DON'T THINK IT HAS IN I IMPACT ON SUPPORTING THE BILL IN LANSING. I TOO -- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE BASE OUR DECISIONS ON FACT. I THINK THE KEY MAY BE AROUND THE TERM "WATER SHUTOFF" RATHER THAN NEED. I CAME TO THE SAME CONCLUSION BASED ON MY CONVERSATIONS WITH STAFF THROUGHOUT THE WEEK THAT WE DID NOT INCREASE AN INCREASE IN THE ACTUAL SHUTOFFS AND ANY SHUTOFFS THAT DID CAN YOU ARE WERE NOT ACTUALLY TO NEED. BUT TO THE POINT IF IT MAKES OTHERS MORE COMFORTABLE WITH THIS, I'M WILLING TO SUPPORT THIS AMENDMENT.
04:27:35.421: >> City Admin. Crawford: IF I COULD PUT OUT, THERE'S A MORATORIUM ON WATER SHUTOFFS AND SO WE ARE NOT EXPERIENCING WATER SHUTOFFS.
04:27:48.001: >> Mayor Taylor: SO AS I WONDER THROUGH, THIS I'M HEARING THERE'S NO WATER SHUTOFFS AND THEREFORE THAT PORTION IS AT LEAST ACCURATE? -- HAS THE CITY EXPERIENCED -- REPORTING WATER AFFORDABILITY.
04:28:09.455: >> City Admin. Crawford: MAYOR, IN THE INTEREST OF THE DENT BEHIND THIS RESOLUTION, THE IDEA THAT COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI HAS TO REMOVE THIS LINE -- OR RADINA TO REMOVE THIS LINE BECAUSE THE OTHER ARE CLEAR AND IDENTIFY IDENTIFIABLE, MAY BE TT WAY TO MOVE FORWARD.
04:28:39.586: >> Mayor Taylor: I'M CONTENT. IS THAT A FRIENDLY CLANG TO THEE BODY? ALL RIGHT. FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE --
04:28:47.627: >> Councilmember Nelson:  CAN YOU REPEAT FOR ME THE FRIENDLY CHANGE THAT WE JUST MADE?
04:28:51.831: >> Mayor Taylor: DELETING THE SECOND WHEREASLAUS IS THAT FURTHER IN ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. DC-4. RESOLUTION TO APPOINT 3 AT-LARGE MEMBERS TO THE COUNCIL OF THE COMMONS, AND CONFIRM THE PAC APPOINTMENT TO THE COUNCIL OF THE COMMONS. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER DISCH. DISCUSSION OF DC-4. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
04:29:25.798: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE TO POSTPONE THIS RESOLUTION UNTIL THE SECOND MEETING IN JANUARY. I HAVEN'T HAD HEY -- A CHANCE TO SPEAK TO ALL THE MEMBERS ON THIS AND COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS AND I. WITH OUR WORK SESSION, MY PAC AND THE CENTER OF THE CITY, IT SUCKED UP A LOT OF MY COMMUNICATE TIME WITH CONSTITUENTS AND SO I'M NOT PREPARED NO MOVE THEM FORWARD. WE HAVE AN EXCELLENT LIST. WE HAVE 13 PEOPLE. A COUPLE HAVE COME IN AFTER THE DEADLINE WHO ARE ALSO VERY QUALIFIED APPLICANTS. AND SO I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE TO POSTPONE THIS TO GIVE US MORE TIME TO WORK ON THIS.
04:30:11.377: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE A SECOND? RAMLAWI. DISCUSSION OF THE POSTPONEMENT. COUNCILMAN RADINA.
04:30:18.017: >> Councilmember Radina: I HAVE A PROCESS QUESTION. I WILL DIRECT IT TOWARDS YOU COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, BUT PERHAPS IT'S A QUESTION FOR STAFF, PARTICULARLY TO THE POINT YOU MADE ABOUT APPLICATIONS COMING IN AFTER THE DEADLINE. I HAVE HAD CONSTITUENTSEACH OUT TO ME WHO WERE UNAWARE OF THE DEADLINE AND WERE INTERESTED AS WELL. AND I WONDER IF THEY SHOULD STILL APPLY, IF WE ARE ACCEPTING LATE APPLICATIONS BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT MADE APPOINTMENT OR IF WE ARE HOLDING FIRM FOR THAT DEADLINE AND IF WE ARE, WOULD CONSIDERING A POSTPONEMENT WOULD MAYBE EVEN BE INTERESTED IN OPENING IT BACK UP AGAIN?
04:30:50.316: >> Councilmember Hayner: WELL, I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT, BECAUSE I TOOK A PACKET FROM OUR COORDINATOR FOR BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS AND HE CUT THEM AT THE DEADLINE AND SENT IT AND IT WAS 13 PEOPLE. HE SENT IT TO COUNCILMAN BRIGGS AND I AND THEN ON THE TUESDAY, I HAD A CENTER OF THE CITY MEETING AND THEY SAID GO BACK AND LOOK. I THINK THERE'S MORE PEOPLE HAVE APPLIED. ANOTHER ONE IN THERE IN GRANICUC AND THERE MAY BE MOREVEN THAN THOSE. I DON'T KNOW THAT OU DDLINE FOR CULLI FROM THE APICATIONS WAS IMPORTANT -I DON'T THINK WE EVE TURN OFF COMMISSIONS EVEN THOUGH WE EXPRESD A DEADLINE THAT WE WANT TO GET IT IN UNDER. I DOT KNOW WHAT OUR PROCEDURE IS - I THINK WE ACCEPT THEM YEAR ROU AND SO I WOULD D, ATOME POI, WE'REOING TO THAT WE'RE SELECTINGROM.GROUP I DOT KNOW WHEN THAT POINT IS. I WISHED I HAD A BETTER AWER. I DOT KNOW IF THERE'S A LEGAL AT THEROUND THE RESUTION THAT SAID THIS IS WN THE CUTOFFS GOING TO BE. D COUNCILMEMBE BRIS TAKE FROMHE SET THAT YOU CAN NSENSE UPON. AGREE.ncmember Hayner: I AT'S PROBABLYHAT I WIL DO. I DON'T KWHEN WE A TOO MEET. Mayor Taylo IS THERE A OBJECTION  TT? MR. CRAWRD. YO ARE LOOKING UNUSUALLY MMCOMMUNICATIVE.
04:32:26.813: >> City Admin. Crawford: I WAS LOOKING AT THE RESOLUTION. IS THERE A DATE?
04:32:29.949: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE DATE IN THE ARE E SOLUTION?
04:32:33.119: >> City Admin. Crawford: I HAVE THE RESOLVE CLAUSES AND THE REPORT FOR MYSELF. I DON'T SEE DATE IN THIS BUT I THOUGHT I HAD READ IT IN THERE, BUT YOUR SOLUTION IS -- MAKES A LOT OF SENSE TO ME.
04:32:47.099: >> Mayor Taylor: ALL RIGHT. COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS, AND HAIHHAYNER, THE DEADLINE THAT YU CONSENT UPON IS GOOD TO ME.
04:33:05.218: >> Councilmember Radina: THAT'S FINE. AND I WILL HAVE MY RESIDENT CONTINUE TO APPLY AND POTENTIALLY BE CONSIDERED.
04:33:10.790: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS.
04:33:12.091: >> Councilmember Briggs: I APPRECIATE COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER'S POSTPONEMENT OF THIS SO WE CAN HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO MEET AND DISCUSS AND DO THAT OVER THE HOLIDAYS. I WOULD THINK MAYBE WE COULD THINK ABOUT WE CAN DISCUSS THIS LATER BUT MAYBE ACCEPTING APPLICATIONS THROUGH THE END OF THE YEAR, SOMETHING WHERE WE FIGURE OUT SOME CUTOFF DATE SO WE REALLY KNOW WHAT WE ARE REVIEWING. AND THEN SINCE WE ARE POSTPONING THIS FOR -- UNTIL THE SECOND MEETING IN JANUARY, I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE WORK TOGETHER AND WORK WITH STAFF TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE REALLY CLEAR ABOUT SORT OF THE PURPOSE AROUND WHAT THE COUNCIL OF COMMONS WILL DO. I THINK THERE'S A FEW PIECES THAT ARE ILL DEFINED RIGHT NOW. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S A SUCCESSFUL BODY WITH A FIERCE SCOPE AND ROLE AND TERM LIMITS AND STUFF FOR THE FOLKS THAT ARE ON THE BODY. WE WILL WORK WITH STAFF TO CLEAR THAT UP HOPEFULLY BEFORE THINGS COME BACK TO COUNCIL IN JANUARY.
04:34:21.794: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
04:34:24.063: >> Councilmember Grand: COUNCILM EMBER BRIGGS HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD. I WANT TO RECOGNIZE A LONG-TERM PARKS COMMISSIONER AND ATTORNEY AND ALL-AROUND, LIKE LEVEL HEADED GREAT PERSON WOULD VOLUNTEERS FOR THIS, AND SO I'M ASSUMING WE WILL MOVE THAT FORWARD AS A WHOLE AND I'M COMFORTABLE WITH THAT. SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT CAME UP AT PAC, AND WERE EXPRESSED BY COMMISSIONERS, WERE AROUND THIS LACK OF CLARITY AND SOME COMMISSIONERS SAID, WELL, HOW CAN WE VOLUNTEER IF HE WITH DON'T TODON'T KNOW THE TIME COMMITMENT IS OR THE PURPOSE OF THIS GROUP WAS. AND ONE COMMISSIONER WAS REALLY -- ASKED A GREAT QUESTION, WHAT DOES THIS MEAN IN TERMS OF RECRUITING FOR DIVERSITY IN THE COMMISSION IF YOU CAN'T TELL APPLICANTS HOW OFTEN THEY ARE GOING TO MEET? AND HOW LONG THE COMMITMENT IS GOING TO BE AND WHAT THE PURPOSE IS? SO I HOPE IN GIVING THAT ADDITIONAL TIME, THAT COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS AND HAYNER CAN WORK WITH STAFF TO. COULD BACK IN TERMS OF MISSION AND TIMELINE SO THAT -- THAT BOTH OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE PARTICIPATING AND WE AS A COUNCIL UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE -- WHAT WE'RE VOTING ON AND WHY WE'RE CONFIRMING OR NOT -- IT'S HARD TO KNOW HOW TO CONFIRM PEOPLE IF WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PURPOSE OF IT IS. AND I THINK PAC WAS ALSO SPOT ON IN SUGGESTING THAT WE HAVE A EXCELLENT FOR LACK OF BETTER TERMS SKATEPARK MODEL TO FOLLOW WHICH AFTER SOME TIME IT RESULTED IN A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING THAT SPOKE BOTH TO PLANS FOR A SITE AND A MEANS OF FUNDING THEM. SO THANKS.
04:36:24.750: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
04:36:25.785: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, MAYOR. I APPRECIATE COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER'S AND COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS' ATTEMPTS AND TO LOOK INTO THIS FURTHER AND DEEPER TO BE ABLE TO MAKE A BETTER DECISION ON WHO TO APPOINT AND SO I APPRECIATE THE DUE DILIGENCE AND THE TIME THAT'S BEING ASKED TO DO THAT. YOU KNOW TO COUNCILMEMBER RADINA. THE FOLKS CAN CONTINUE TO APPLY. I KNOW THERE'S OFTEN PEOPLE WOULD HAVE TO LEAVE BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS BEFORE THEIR TERMS ARE UP AN YOU HAVE TO GO BACK AND LOOK AT THE APPLICANTS AND THOSE MI APPLICANTS WHO APPLIED WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE APPOINTMENT IN THOSE CASES. I DEFINITELY THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO STAY WITHIN OUR DEADLINES THAT WE HAD SET. I THINK, YOU KNOW, FOR TRANSPARENCY AND CONSISTENCY, AND INTEGRITY, I THINK WE SHOULD DO THAT. I THINK THAT'S A STANDARD PRACTICE. YOU SET DEADLINES FOR REASONS LIKE THAT, AND YOU NEED TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THEM. BUT I WOULD ENCOURAGE OTHERS TO APPLY FOR FOR FUTURE NEEDS. AND I BELIEVE TIME COMMITMENTS, YOU KNOW, WHO KNOWS. WHEN YOU ARE ON THESE BOARDS AN COMMISSIONS, ONE MONTH, YOU MIGHT SPEND, 10, 20 HOURS ON AN ISSUE, AND THEN THE NEXT MONTH OR SO, THERE'S VERY LITTLE TO BE DONE. SO I THINK WHAT FOLKS SHOULD EXPECT BY SERVING ON THIS NEWLY FORM BIS WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT ON ANY OF OUR BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS AND I THINK THERE'S 64 OF THEM CURRENTLY THAT THE CITY HAS. SO JUST SOME FEEDBACK ON TO THIS PROCESS HERE. I DON'T THINK THESE ISSUES AN THESE QUESTIONS SHOULD SUSPEND PROGRESS. I THINK A LOT OF THESE ISSUES AND DECISIONS WILL BE MADE ONCE THESE DECISIONS ARE MADE AND THEY CAN WORK THROUGH THE GROWTH OF THIS COMMITTEE WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF CITY RESOURCES AND CITY STAFF. BUT, YOU KNOW, THERE'S GOING TO BE THESE TYPE OF CONCERNS AND QUESTIONS REGARDLESS OF THE NATURE OF THE BOARD OR THE COMMISSION AND IT'S NOT EASY LAUNCHING SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T HAVE A TEMPLATE. SO THANKS AND GOOD LUCK WITH ALL OF THAT.
04:39:04.910: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
04:39:05.778: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANKS. JUST AGAIN TO SPEAK TO THIS PONEMENT, YES, THE FINAL RESOLVE CLAUSE OF OUR PREVIOUS RESOLUTION, IT DID SAY APPOINTMENTS SHOULD BE MADE ON OR BEFORE THE 29t 21st AND WE CLOSED THEM ON THE 11th. I THINK IT WILL BE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF EVERYONE IF WE DO DELAY THIS. WE COULD FILL IN THREE NAMES BECAUSE MR. BORGSDORFF DID TEN UP AT PAC AND VOLUNTEER. I PUT THE RESOLUTION ON THE AJEN AGENDA IN KEEPING THAT. I APPRECIATE THE CONSIDERATION THAT WE WOULD DELAY THIS AND I WILL PUT TOGETHER A PACKET PRIOR TO THIS VOTE WHEN WE COME BACK IN THE SECOND MEETING IN JANUARY AND THAT DESCRIBES -- THE TASK FORCE REPORT AND THE AN I SI LAIRY DOCUMENTS SPEAK TO THIS UP COULD SILL OF THE COMMONS AND WATT TASK AND THE FUNCTION IS AND, YOU KNOW, IT WILL HELP TO EXPLAIN A LITTLE FURTHER WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THAT AND HOPEFULLY THAT WILLEN HELP US IN MAKING A ZIG AS PEOPLE WHO SIT THERE FOR THAT INITIAL SET MEETINGS AND DECIDE THE BYLAWS AND WHATILL MOVE FORWARD AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO CONTINUE TO ALOO I FOR ANY BOARD OR COMMISSION THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. PUT YOUR NAME IN THE HAT IN YOUR NAME IS NOT IN THERE. THERE, YOU DON'T HAVE A CHANCE. THANK YOU FOR THE SLIGHT DELAY. I THINK IT'S ALL GOING TO WORK OUT. THANK YOU.
04:40:29.228: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS.
04:40:34.767: >> Councilmember Briggs: YEAH. I JUST WANTED TO PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT MORE THOUGHTS ON WHY I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO COUNCILMEMBER ARE A DEANA.'S POINT -- I GUESS IT WAS COUNCILMEMBER GRAND'S POINT AROUND THE TIMING OF -- OF WHEN PEOPLE WILL SERVE. I JUST RECENTLY GOT OFF OF PLANNING COMMISSION AND SO I KNEW THAT THAT WAS GOING TO BE A COMMITMENT OF EVERY TUESDAY NIGHT AND I COULD BUDGET FOR THAT. AND OBVIOUSLY THE PREPARATION THAT CAME ALONG WITH THAT WAS GREATER THAN WHAT WAS IN THE MEETING, BUT IT WAS CLEAR WHEN I WOULD BE IN THE MEETINGS AND THAT WAS SOMETHING I WENT I IO THAT GROUP KNOWING AND THE FOLKS SERVING ON MOST OF OUR BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS UNDERSTAND BEFORE THEY ARE GOING IN WHAT THE DAY AND THE TIME OF THOSE MEETINGS ARE GOING TO BE AND HOW FREQUENT THEY ARE GOING TO BE. IT'S VERY DIFFERENT MEETING FOUR TIMES A MONTH. IT'S A MUCH LARGER COMMITTEE. I HAVE THINK WE NEED TO BE UP FRONT WHAT WE ARE ASKING OF FOLKS AND MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE GETTING THE REICH PEOPLE TO -- THE RIGHT PEOPLE TO THE TABLE AND COMMIT TO THIS IMPORTANT TASK IN FRONT OF US. AND I'M SURE THAT COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER AND I CAN WORK WITH STAFF TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S REALLY CLEAR WHAT THIS -- THE ROLE ON THIS SCOPE ARE GOING TO BE.
04:42:02.187: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION?
04:42:09.628: >> City Admin. Crawford: MAYOR, I DO RECALL THE DATES T COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER IS IN REFERRING TO. I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU HANDLE THIS RESOLUTION, BUT YOU MIGHT CONSIDER ADDING A RESOLVE CLAUSE TO THIS RESOLUTION, CONFERRING ITS COMPLETION TO A DATE DETERMINED IN THE FUTURE. YOU KNOW, UNTIL THE FIRST MEETING IN FEBRUARY, FOR EXAMPLE.
04:42:34.953: >> Councilmember Hayner: INSTEAD OF SIMPLY POSTPONING IT YOU MEAN?
04:42:40.259: >> City Admin. Crawford: THAT R MIND.ORK. MY THOUGHT ON THAT NOW A I SAY THAT, IS I BELIEVE IN THE RESOLUTION YOU HAVE, YOU SET A SPECIFIC DATE FOR ACTION, BEING THIS DATE. IF -- AND I'M NOT FIN FINDING LANGUAGE, BUT IN THE LANGUAGE WAS YOU WERE SELECTING SOMEONE ON THIS DATE, I GUESS YOU C JUST POSTPONE THAT. NEVER MIND. POSTPONE IT.
04:43:09.321: >> Councilmember Hayner: MS. BEAUTRY SENT THAT ARORO COIR I THE 11th AND THE1st. IT'S ON ME FOR NOT THINKING AHEAD THAT WE HAD A FIVE-HOUR WORK SESSION AND THAT EOC MEETING AND A SURPRISE CLOSED SESSION ON THE WEDNESDAY. IT JUST ATE UP MY WEEK AND I WAS FULLY UNPREPARED FOR THIS MEETING AND I THOUGHT LET'S PUT IT ON THE AGENDA BEFORE WEDNESDAY. THAT'S ALL. OKAY.
04:43:39.651: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE POSTPONEMEN L  FAVOR?
04:43:48.327: >> Mayor Taylor: ANY COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE ATTORNEY?

04:45:20.319: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER.
04:45:24.289: >> MME IS JOE SPALDING. I'M CALLING FROM GREAT STATE OF MICHIGAN! I WANTED TO THANK COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI FOR MENTIONING ELECTRIC VEHICLES. TALKING ABOUT THOSE. HE'S ABSOLUTELY CORRECT HERE. HE CAN BE EVEN MORE WHEN HE TALKS ABOUT CAR-CENTRIC INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT'S REALLY COOL. I LOO I CANNED THAT. WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE AS A 36-YEAR RESIDENT OF THE GREAT UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, IS THE NOT SO SUBTLETTEMPT TOPRESS FREE SPEECH IN THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. THIS IS DESPICABLE. THREE MEMBERS OF THIS COUNCIL OWE ADAM GOODMAN AN APOLOGY FOR SPEAKING OVER HIM. YOU ALL HAVE YOUR TIME WHERE YOU CAN SPEAK. YOU KNOW HOW TO USE IT AND YOU SHOULD. YOU SHOULD NOT BE SILENCING MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. YOU SHOULD NOT BE PASSING RULES AND THE CITY ATTORNEY WILL MAKE SURE YOU KNOW THAT ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAT IF YOU ARE TRYING TO SILENCE ME, THAT'S AN ACTIONABLE OFFENSE, AND I'M NOT THE PERSON THAT GETS ANGRY, BUT I GET EXCITED, AND I GET LITIGIOUS. LET'S MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE NOT SILENCING FREE SPEECH AND LET'S NOT PRETEND THAT WE HAVE SORT OF REVERENCE. WE HAVE COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER WHO TALKED ON HIS PHONE WHEN DR. LISA JACKSON WAS SPEAKING, GIVING HER BRIEFING FROM THE POLICE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE A FEW MONTHS AGO. I HAVE IT ON VIDEO. YOUR L LIPS ARE MOVING. WE CAN SEE YOURS MOVING. YOU KNOW, SO WHEN IT COMES TO EWE PRESSION OF FREE SPEECH, THERE'S A RIGHT SONG AND A RIDE SONG. AND IT'S PATRIOTIC AND AMERICAN AND YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS. WHEN IT COM COMES TO THE ACCEPTE ACTIONS WE HAVE TO EXPECT MORE FROM OURSELVES. IF YOU CAN'T HANDLE SOME CRITICISM -- THE MAYOR GETS CALLED A DEMON BY THE SAME CALLERS EVERY WEEK AND HE KEEPS IT COOL. MY QUESTION IS:  WHY SHOULD YOU TIP TO BE CITY COUNCILMEMBERS, ESPECIALLY YOU COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, WHEN, YOU HAVE KNOW, TRY TO SUPPRESS FREE SPEECH AND YOU DON'T COME PREPARED AND YOU DON'T -- TAKE SOME,ABILITY. THOUGH SOME BRAVERY FOR ONCE AND PUT SOME TRUST IN THE PUBLIC. IF YOU CAN'T HANDLE A FEW THE WORDS THAT SOME PEOPLE SAY BECAUSE THEY ARE CRITICAL OF YOU. YOU NEED TO SPEAK TO A THERAPIST. AND THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME SPEAK WITHOUT INTERRUPTING ME.
04:48:20.766: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. CLERK CALLERITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING 891, DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT?

THAT SPEAK DIRECTLY TO ISSUES THAT CAME UP IN THE COUNCIL MEETING TONIGHT. IT READS IN MCL15-263A, A PUBLIC MEETING HELD ELECTRONICALLY UNDER THE SECTION... SO THE PUBLIC PARENTANTS CAN HEAR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC BODY AND CAN BE HEARD BY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC BODY AND OTHER PARTICIPANTS DURING A PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD. THIS IS NOT OLD LAW BUT FAIRLY NEW. YOU SHOULD HEED IT. INTERRUPTING PUBLIC COMMENTS, IT'S A VIOLATION OF THE OPEN MEETINGS ACT. AT LEAST IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE READING. IN ANY CASE AS A PREVIOUS COMMENTER SAID, THANK YOU FOR NOT SHOUTING ME DOWN DURING MY PUBLIC COMMENT. AGAIN, EDWARD VILLAMETTE, ANN ARBOR, MICHIGAN.

PERCENTAGE OF POOR RATINGS NEARLY DOUBLED. IT'S -- DISCUSSION OF THE GROUP THAT WE CAN COMMIT TO DIFFERENT KIND OF BEH SAID GRAND. THAT'S COOL, I GUESS.

GROUND OPINIONS IN P PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN REASON, AND EXPERTISE. SPEAK WHEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO ADD TO THE CONVERSATION. NOT WITH -- YOU KNOW. THE COMMON FOLK, PERSON IS TELLING ME YOU ARE DOING A SHITTY JOB. PROMOTE RESPECT FOR CITY STAFF. ARE YOU SERIOUS ABOUT THAT ONE? I HOPE SO. WHEN PEOPLE SPEAK WITH I STATEMENT SUCH AS I THINK I HEAR YOU SAYING RATHER THAN YOU SAID TRY TO AVOID INJECTING PAST EXPERIENCES. AND I HAVE A QUESTION BEFORE TIME RUNS OUT.

04:53:41.519: >> Mayor Taylor: YES, WE CAN.
04:53:42.153: >> THERE ARE A FEW THINGS THAT MAKE MY HEAD SPIN. I HEARD A WHOLE BUNCH OF PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT THE SHORT-TERM RENTAL ISSUE SAY THAT THE CURRENT OPERATORS QUOTE, LEGAL, UNQUOTE. I THINK THE CITY ATTORNEY MAY HAVE GIVEN YOU SOME ADVICE ON TH, MY BET IS IT WAS ABIT MORE MIXED THAN THAT. I THINK YOU SHOULD SAY THAT NOW THE KNOWING THAT. YOU CAN I CAN MA AN MARGEMENT TT THEY ARE VIOLATING THE CURRENT ARGUMENT AND THAT'S WHAT IS A LEGAL NON-CONFORMING USE. IS IT LEGAL OR NOT? AND NONE OF YOU CAN SAY IT IS BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW I THINK .I ANY THAT SOME OF YOU HAVE LEGAL TRAINING AND I BET THE ONES WHO ARE HAVE NOT STUDIED IT BUT THEY STILL ARE SAYING IT WITHOUT KNOWING THAT THAT'S REALLY BAD. THE WHOLE POINT, IF THEY ARE NOT LEGAL, THEN YOU, THE CITY SHOULD BE SUING ONE OF THEM AS A TEST CASE TO DETERMINE THAT, AND NOT JUST ASSUMING AND SAYING IT AS IF IT'S REAL. IT'S NOT. NUMBER TWO, THAT THELE ISSUE OF THE WER RATES -- IT WAS A GREAT DISCUSSION, EXCEPT IT IGNORED THE HAHN LAWSUIT COMPLETELY AND THE PROBLEM IS THAT OUR CURRENT METHOD OF FUNDING WATER INFRASTRUCTURE, WHICH I TOTALLY AGREE WITH AND I WANT IT FUND AND I WOULD BE WILLING TO PAY A TAX TO DO THAT, BUT T CURRENT WAY O FUNNG THAT FOR TENS OF MILLION OF DOARS AND YOU ARE COMPLETELY IGNORINGHAT. YOU JUST ADDED GIGTICMOUNT LAWSUIT.E DAMAG OF THAT AN WHEN YOU SIT TRE AND YOU Y, WE'RE TRYING T BE RESPONSIE STEWARDS AND FISCA RESPSIBILITY A AVOID LAWSUIT RISK YOU DID EXACT THE OPPOSITE TO TH TUNE OF MILLIS OF DOLRS TONHT.

04:56:44.135: >> Mayor Taylor: YES, YOU ARE HEARD.
04:56:45.336: >> HELLO, THIS IS ALLEN HABER. I WANTED TO COMMENT ON THE COUNCIL OF THE COMMONS POSTPONEMENT AND CONSIDERATION. I WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED THAT YOU WEREN'T ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD AND ACCELERATE THIS WHOLE PROCESS. AND THEN IN THIS WAY, THE COUNCIL HAS VERY LITTLE DEFINITION AND NEEDS MORE DISCUSSION. ATENTATIVE TO THE DISCUSSION IN THE TASK FORCE, IT'S SEEN AS COMING OUT OF THE ACTIVITIES BY PEOPLE GENERATING USING THESE COMMONS AND DOING ACTIVITY AND MUTUAL AID AND SO ON AND SO FORTH. THE ACTIVITY, THE DOING OF IT COMING BEFORE T GOVERNANCE OFF IT AND YOU ARE SETTING UP A KIND OF GOVERNANCE BEFORE THAT WHAT IS TO BE GOVERNED WHICH IS THE ENERGY OF PEOPLE BEING RELEASED IN A PLACE THAT BELONGS TO ALL OF US. ARE. I THINK FURTHER CONSIDERATION OF HOW THIS COUNCIL OF THE COMMONS FUNCTIONS BUT PARTICULARLY YOUR CONTINUED ENCOURAGEMENT TO PEOPLE GETTING INVOLVES AND DO THANKS ON THIS SPAND THE PREVIOUS COMMITTEE IS GETTING TOGETHER A LOT OF INFORMATION AND THEY ARE MOVING ALONG. SO I HOPE WE CAN SEE SOME CONTINUED COOPERATION BUT THERE NEEDS TO BE A AGAINST OF HOW YOU SEE THE COUNCIL OF THE COMMONS AND THE PEOPLE THERE AS A RESERVOIR TO MAKE THIS A VIBRANT DOWNTOWN DESTINATION FOR EVERYONE. I LOOK FORWARD FOR WHEN YOU BRING IT BACK B YOU, BUT DO READ WHAT I SENT TO YOU ABOUT ABUNDANCE AND THE GIFT ECONOMY AND THE IMPORTANCE OF PUTTING SOMEONE IN ABOUT THE INDENOUS COMMUNITY AND LOOKS BACK TO BEFORE WE WERE HERE. I WANT TO UNDERSCORE YOU ALSO, THAT IN THE COMPOSITION OF WHATEVER BECOMES T COLLECTIVE GOVERNANCE OF THIS, THE INDIGENOUS VOICE THAT COMMONS THE GIFT AS THE POTAWATOMI WOMAN EXPRESSED IN THE PAPER "ABUNDANCE." THAT I SENT TO YOU. DO READ IT.
04:59:32.070: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
04:59:33.838: >> ANYHOW, THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO SAY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK. YOU REALLY TYKE TO A LOT OF THE STUFF. CONGRATULATIONS AND THE COMMONS IS COMING TO ANN ARBOR. DO BE PART OF IT.
04:59:52.323: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
04:59:53.658: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER WITH 340. DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT?
05:00:01.132: >> YES. CAN YOU HEAR ME? CAN EVERYBODY HEAR ME?
05:00:06.471: >> Mayor Taylor: YES, WE CAN.
05:00:07.772: >> HI, MY NAME IS WILL YOU LIEU LOUIS VASQUEZ.INTERRUPTINGN TAXPAYER ADAM GOODMAN DURING PUBLIC COMMENTARY BY COUNCILMEMBERS GRISWOLD, HAYNER AND RAMLAWI WAS VERY DISAPPOINTING TO ME, AND I FEEL VERY EMBARRASSED FOR ANN ARBOR AS I SEE SUCH NAKED EXERCISES OF CENSORSHIP BY PUBLIC OFFICIALS WHO SHOULD KNOW BETTER THAN TO ATTACK A CONSTITUENT WHILE THEY ARE SPEAKING FROM THE PODIUM. HARDING JEFF HAYNER'S SECOND FLOOR ADDITION ON TO HIS HOUSE, FOIAS HAVE BEEN FILED, AND MANY PARTIES NOW AND THE TRUTH WILL COME OUT EVENTUALLY AS TO WHAT REALLY HAPPENED. YOU KNOW, I'M NOT CALLING FOR JEFF HAYNER'S RESIG FOR VIOLATING OUR CITY'S NORMS AND REGULATIONS BUT I'M ASKING THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR AND THE CITY ATTORNEY TO CONDUCT A PROPER INVESTIGATION INTO MR. MAINER'S CONDUCT CONCERNING HIS SECOND FLOOR ADDITION. SECONDLY, I WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT MR. HAYNER NOT CENSOR AND BLOCK HIS CONSTITUENTS ON SOCIAL MEDIA. HE FREQUENTLY COMMENTS AND POSTS ON CITY COUNCIL MATTERS AND ESPECIALLY ON FACE BACK AND OTHER VENN EWES AND ALL OF HIS CONSTITUENTS DESERVE TO KNOW WHAT HE HOSTS SO THAT THEY AND WE CAN PETITION FOR REDRESS OF GRIEVANCES IN FRONT OF CITY COUNCIL. I WOULD ASK IF MR. HAYNER'S BLOCKING OF CONSTITUENTS A VIOLATION OF OUR FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS AND THAT SHOULDN'T MR. HAYNER BE ADMONISHED FOR -- YOU KNOW, TO NOT DRAW THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR INTO POTENTIAL LAWSUITS. AND FINALLY, I WOULD ASK COUNCILMAN RAMLAWI, GRISWOLD, AND HAYNER, WHERE HAVE YOU EVER BEEN INTERRUPTED WHILE SPEAKING BEFORE OUR CITY COUNCIL AS A PUBLIC CITIZEN? THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
05:02:47.298: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
05:02:49.467: >> Clerk Beaudry: THERE ARE NO OTHER CALLERS WITH THEIR HANDS RAISED.
05:02:53.037: >> Mayor Taylor: ARE THERE ANY CALLERS WHO WISH TO SPEAK, PLEASE RENT STAR NINE NOW. SEEING NO ONE, OTHER COMMUNICATIONS FROM COUNCIL. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
05:03:12.623: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, MAYOR TAYLOR. I WOULD LIKE TO TRAY TO CORRECT THE NARRATIVE THAT IS BEING PORTRAYED RIGHT NOW BY FOLKS WHO OFTEN WE HAVE PO  POLICY -- I HE POLICY DIFFERENCES TO USE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO MISCHARACTERIZE MY INTENTIONS AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS MEETING. IT WAS NOT TO CENSOR THE PUBLIC SPEAKER. I ASKED FOR A CALL TO ORDER. I FELT IT WAS OFF SCRIPT AND DOES NOT ABIDE BY THE RULES THAT WE ADOPTED TONIGHT ABOUT STICKING TO THE ISSUE. AND I KNOW THE MAYOR AND THE COUNCIL HAVE BEEN CALLED A LOT OF NASTY THINGS AND MYSELF INCLUDED. I'M HUMAN I HAVE EMOTION AND SOMETIMES IT GETS THE BEST OF ME. BUT MY INTENT WAS NOT TO CENSOR ANYBODY. ANYONE HAS FOLLOWED MY CAMPAIGN TRAIL AND MY HISTORY OF GETTING HERE, THEY KNOW CENSORSHIP IS NOT WHAT I STAND FOR. I WAS POLITICALLY BLACKMAILED IN MY CAMPAIGN FOR THE ISSUES OF FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS AND SUCH. SO I STAND BY DEFENDING THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES. MY ISSUELIER WAS TO CALL TO ORDER WHAT I THOUGHT WAS OFFSCRIPT AND PERHAPS I WHAT WRONG. BUT THAT'S -- I FELT WHAT MY RIGHT IS, AND FRANKLY, MY RESPONSIBILITY AND SO IT'S NOT TO CENSOR ANYBODY.
05:05:15.980: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
05:05:18.716: >> Councilmember Hayner: WELL, I THINK THAT -- WHEN HAVE I BEEN INTERRUPTED. OF COURSE ANYBODY WHO HAS SPOKEN AT COUNCIL, AS A THREE-MINUTE PERSON, ESPECIALLY AROUND TOPICS THAT WERE CHARGED IN THE COMMUNITY. I HAVE BEEN INTERRUPTED SEVERAL TIMES SPEAKING AT COUNCIL. JEERS, BOOS, CLAPPING, FINGER SNAPPING, WHATEVER, ALL KINDS OF STUFF AND MANY, MANY, WAYS. SO IT HAPPENS. IT HAPPENS. AND IT ESPECIALLY HAPPENS WHEN THE FACILITATOR  THE MEETING DOESN'T FACILITATE OR FOLLOW THE RULES. IT'S NOT NOT SPEAKING TO THE TOPIC, BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE VIOLATION OF THE RULE WHERE YOU ARE HAPPY TO TAKE YOUR ABUSE, MR. MAYOR WITH THE REST OF US WHEN THEY WERE CALLED RACISTS FOR NOT SUPPORTING THE PALESTINIAN RITES RIGHTS AS AN EXAMPLE. SOME OF US ARE NOT DELIGHTED WITH THE NOTION THAT PEOPLE CAN COMEN HER SLANDER AND LIE AND SAY ALL KINDS OF WHATEVER POPS IN THEIR HEAD ABOUT THINGS THEY THINK THEY THOUGH ABOUT US NO MATTER HOW FALSE THEY ARE. IN AN EFFORT TO, WHO KNOWS WHAT IS IN THIS TH THEIR AHEADS AND Y DON'T WANT TO KNOW, FRANKLY. IF WE ARE GOING TO ADOPT THESE RULES AND THE RULES AREN'T GOING TO BE FOLLOWED, OR PUT INTO HA TO CALL FOR ORD.HOICE DO W AND, YES, HAVE BEEN INTERRUPTED MANY TIMES WHEN SPEAKING AT THE PODIUM IN T COUNCILHAMBERS. AND THAT'S JUST HOW IT GS. THAT'S JUST HOW IT GOES. IF SOMEBODY LIKES OR DOESN'T THEY ARE SITTING ITHEAY, AND AUDIENCE, TH ARE WELME TO YT. WE HAVE COUNCILMEERS WHO JUST SOMEONE I SPEAKIN ABOUTWHEN SOMETHG THEY DON'T LIKE. AND IF THAT  IF T VTUAL UIVALENT OFHAT I I'M J GOG TO GET UPND LEA MY CITY-IUED DEVICE, THEN PERHAPS WITH THE PRECEDENT HAS BNEPING OUT. PROPRIATE EIER. TT'S AND IASN'TURE ATHE TIM CAUSE WE S ITEGULARLY WHERCERTAIN CNCILMEMBERS WOULD SND UPNDALK OUT OF E ROOM WHEN PEOPLE WERE AT THE PODIUM. AND I FOUND THAT ALMOSTVERY BIT A OFFSIVE. THAT HAPNED WAY BAC WN T EVEN SAYAY WN, WHEN PEOPLE WERE -- YOU KNOW, THEY JUST DOESN'T HAVE ANY PRIOR TO THE REORGIZATION, COUNCILHAMBERS WHER THE TABL WEREN A DFERENT RMAT. WE WERE TALKING.AND LEAVE WHEN AND SO SO THAT'S SIMILARLY UNNECESSARY, BUT I SUPPOSE IT'S BETTER THAN CALLING FOR ORDER WHEN COUNCIL RULES ARE BEING BROKEN. 'S.I GUESS WHEN PEOE START SLAPPEDDERRING I SHOULD GET UP AND WALK AWAY AND BLOW OFF THEIR SCENE. IT'S AN UNUSUAL SITUATION WE HAVE HERE, WHERE SOME PEOPLE ARE HANGING OUT THE CITY BUILDING DEPARTMENT. I WOULD LIKE TO SAY, YES, I HAVE BEEN INTERRUPTED MANY TIMES.
05:08:56.467: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RADINA.
05:08:58.002: >> Councilmember Radina: THANK YOU, MR. MAYND WANTO USE MOMENTS SOMETHING THAT YOU ALREADY ADDRESSED EARLIER BUT ALSO TO APOLOGIZE TO THE PUBLIC AND TO PARTICULARLY ANY BLACK MEMBERS OF OUR CITY WHO WERE LISTENING IN TONIGHT AND HEARD AN OFFENSIVE AND UNACCEPTABLE RACIAL SLUR THAT DISGUST AND ENGAGED ME. I ACTUALLY ALMOST CALLED FOR US TO TAKE A MOMENT BREAK BECAUSE I WAS SO UPSET BY IT BUT I DIDN'T AND HIM TO DISRUPTUS TONIGHT. I THINK IT EMPHASIZES THAT RACISM IS STILL A VERY REAL AND VERY RENT  PRESENT IN OUR COUNTD COMMUNICATE AND MORE PREVALENT NOW BECAUSE OF THE PLATFORM THAT'S BEEN GIVEN BY OUR SOON-TO SOON-TO-BE EX-PRESIDENT AND THE ANONYMITY OF THE EVENTS. AND I THINK WE NEED TO PRIORI OUR ANTIRACISM WORK AND PRIORIZE THE EQUIT WORK. I THINK IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT THERE'S A STILL A PROBLEM AND THERE'S STILL A FRANKLY DISCAN CUSTOMERRING SEGMENT OF SOCIETY THAT SUBSCRIBES TO THESE HORRIFIC RACIST BELIEVES AND I APOLOGIZE TO ANYONE WHO WAS LISTENING AND APPRECIATE THE CLERK FOR DISCONNECTING THE CALL AND I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE FURTHER CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO TO PRO PREVENT THESE THIS IN THE FUTURE. I KNOW IT'S LIKELY DIFFICULT WHEN FOLKS ARE ALLOWED TO CALL IN, BUT I WANTED TO ADDRESS IT. IT WAS WORTH CONVERSATION AND REFLECTION. I HOPE IT UNDERSCORES OUR NEED TO CONSIDER OUR ANTIRACISM WORK AND TO MAKE OUR CITY A MORE INCLUSIVE PLACE. THANK YOU.
05:11:06.964: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
05:11:08.499: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK TR, I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT. AND I ALSO WANT -- I DO WANT TO APOLOGIZE AND IT WAS BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION WHEN I WAS LOOKING AT SOMETHING ON THE BREAK ABOUT -- ABOUT THE USE OF THE TERM "GRANDFATHERING" AND I WOULD REQUEST FROM -- WHICH I UNDERSTAND HAS RACIST ROOTS AND I APOLOGIZE FOR USING IT AND IF PLANNING STAFF COULD GOODIVE US A WORD THAT SAYS THE SAME THING THAT WE CAN ALL GET O THE SAME PAGE AND USE, I WOULD BE VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THAT. SO I WANT TO APOLOGIZE FOR MY REPETITIVE USE OF THAT TERM, AND IF IT OFFENDED ANYONE. AND I WANT TO SAY I THIS -- IN THE AHEAD, I'M LOOKING TO WORKING WITH ADMIN AND TAL ABOUT OUR RULES SO WE CAN RAISE THE LEVEL AT THIS BEHAVIOR AND TAKE MANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR BEHAVIOR. THANKS.
05:12:27.110: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD? COUNCILMEMBER, YOU ARE ON MUTE.
05:12:37.988: >> Councilmember Griswold: SORRY, IT'S AFTER M I WANT TOND THE B THKINGVERYONE ON COUNCIL, STAFF, AND ESPECIALLY COMMUNITY MEMBERS FOR ENGAGES IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT. I THINK THAT WHILE TONIGHT'S PETEING HAS NOT BEEN CORDIAL -- MEETING HAS NOT BEEN CORDIAL, WE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT. I WOULD LIKE TO READ A QUOTE FROM ELEANORTISCUSES IDEAS AND SMALL MINDS DISCUSS PEOPLE. GOOD NIGHT.
05:13:23.634: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS.
05:13:35.545: >> Councilmember Briggs: I WANTED TO THANK COUNCILMEMBER RADINA FOR FOCUSING ON THE ONE PERSON WHO CALLED IN TONIGHT. IT'S UNBELIEVABLE THAT WE CAN EXPERIENCE A CALL LIKEN 2020 AND I'M GLAD YOU ARE DRAWING ATTENTION TO IT AT THE END OF THE NIGHT. I THINK IT WILL BE CHALLENGING TO FIND WAYS TO PREVENT IT. AND WE NEED TO CALL IT OUT WHEN WE SEE IT AND -- AND ALL STATE HOW MUCH WE FIND IT TO BE DEPLORABLE ACTION. AND ALSO THANK YOU, HAD COUNCILMEMBER GRAND. I THINK IT'S TO MAKE LEGALLYORM- IT'S JUST NOT CATCHY. BUT WE WILL HAVE TO GET ON BOARD WITH THE APPROPRIATE WELCOME. AND -- LANGUAGE AND I'M GLAD THE ADMIN COMMITTEE HAS BEEN -- THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF CLAIMS TONIGHT, THAT SOME RULES WERE BROKEN AND MAYBE THIS -- I DON'T WANT TO DRAG THIS CONVERSATION OUT LONGER, BUT'MNG THROUGH THE RULES AND I'M HAVING A HARD TIME UNDERSTANDING WHERE THE MAYOR DID NOT ENFORCE APPROPRIATELY. I MEAN, DISORDERLY CONDUCT AT MEETINGS SUGGESTS THAT THE CHAIR MAY CALL TO ORDER ANY PERSON WOULD ENGAGES IN PERSONAL ATTACKS, NOT SHALL, AND SO THERE IS A FAIR AMOUNT OF DISCRETION THERE AND I THINK THE CONVERSATION AROUND PERSONAL ATTACKS IS FAIRLY -- THAT THAT'S MAYBE SOMETHING THAT THE ADMIN COMMITTEE MAY WANT TO DIG IN A LITTLE DEEPER ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS SO WE CAN COME TO SOME AGREEMENT ABOUT THAT. I WOULD LIKE TO GO ON RECORD AND STATE THAT I THINK IT'S REALLY APPROPRIATE THAT COUNCILMEMBERS YELLED OVER A MEMBER OF PUBLIC WHO WAS CALLING IN TONIGHT AND WAS NOT BREAKING ANY OF OUR RULES, AS FAR AS I CAN TELL.
05:15:51.982: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER COMMUNICATION FROM COUNCIL? MR. POSTEMA, DO WE HAVE A CLOSED SESSION TODAY?
