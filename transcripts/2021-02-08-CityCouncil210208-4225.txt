00:00:53.501: >> THANK YOU, MAYOR. I WILL SHARE A PRESENTATION WITH YOU WHICH IS ATTACHED TO THE AGENDA PACKET. CAN YOU SEE THAT, MAYOR?
00:01:14.155: >> YES.
00:01:14.722: >> OKAY, SO TONIGHT'S PRESENTATION IS THE BEGINNING OF THE PROCESS FOR US TO TALK ABOUT THE FISCAL 22 AND 23 BUDGET AND FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE NOT BEEN TO THIS BEFORE AFTER THE SCHOOL YEAR STARTS THIS COMING JULY AND EVERY OTHER YEAR WE DO A TWO-YEAR PLANNING PROCESS. THIS IS THE YEAR WE WILL DO BOTH YEARS. SO TONIGHT'S DISCUSSION IS REALLY ABOUT THE BUDGET STARTING THIS JULY AND GOING FOR A YEAR AND THEN PROJECTIONS FOR THE FOLLOWING YEAR AFTER THAT. WE WILL REVIEW - - I'LL GIVE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE GENERAL FUND AND WHAT THINGS LOOK LIKE, AND THEN WE'LL GO THROUGH WHAT WE CALL IMPACTS WHICH IS WHERE STAFF HAS TAKEN THE EXISTING OPERATIONS THAT WE HAVE, AND THE PROJECTIONS TO CONTINUE THOSE IN THE FUTURE, AND IF SOMETHING NEEDS TO CHANGE WE GIVE YOU A SERVICE IMPACT AND THEN THOSE WILL EACH BE DESCRIBED AND I'LL WALK YOU THROUGH, I'LL DESCRIBE IN MORE DETAIL WHEN I GO THROUGH THE CITY ADDMAN STRAIGHTERS AREA SO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT FORMAT. BUT EVERYONE WILL BE FOLLOWING THE SAME STRUCTURE.  OOZE THE MAYOR SAID TODAY'S DISCUSSION IS AROUND THE GENERAL FUND, POLICE, FIRE, COMMUNITY SERVICES, AND THE COURTS, AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIVITIES. THE - - AFTER TONIGHT WE'LL FOLLOW-UP WITH ADDITIONAL WORK SESSIONS.  ON THE 22ND WE'LL COVER THE RETIREMENT SYSTEM AND ANN ARBOR HOUSING COMMISSION. ON THE MARCH 8 WE WILL COVER PUBLIC SERVICES WHICH IS A LOT OF AREA TO COVER, AND THE CITY'S ATTORNEYS OFFICE. MARCH 22 WE'LL DO THE DDA AND THE SMART ZONE.  BY THE END OF MARCH YOU WILL HAVE HEARD AND I WILL HAVE HEARD ALL THE CONVERSATIONS IN QUESTIONS THAT PEOPLE HAVE HAD, AND BOY THE END OF MARCH I TRY TO FORMULATE THE CITY'S ADMINISTRATORS RECOMMENDED BUDGET. THAT IS PREPARED AND PROVIDED TO YOU AS A COUNCIL AS INTRODUCTORY ITEM ON APRIL 19.  SPECIFICALLY A FAIRLY SHORT PRESENTATION BECAUSE NOW -F MATERIAL HAS BEEN COVERED AND IT'S REALLY HIGHLIGHTING THE ACTUAL RECOMMENDATIONS AND THEN YOU'LL GET A SIGNIFICANT DOCUMENT THAT GOES WITH IT WITH ALL THE DETAILS. FROM THE 19TH END, THEN THE PUBLIC HAVING HEARD ALL OF THIS DISCUSSION BETWEEN NOW AND THEN THE PUBLIC HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH IN ON MAY 3, WHERE WE HAVE PUBLIC HEARINGS ON THE BUDGET, AND ANY FEES OR REVENUE INCREASES THAT WE HAVE THAT REQUIRE PUBLIC HEARING.  THOSE ARE ALL DONE ON MAY 3.  AND THEN LASTLY ON MAY 17, COUNCIL ACTUALLY CONSIDERS ADOPTION OF THE BUDGET WHERE YOU HAVE AN OPTION TO AMEND IT. ULTIMATELY,, ADOPT WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE IMPLEMENTED FOR THE YEAR STARTING IN JULY. JUMPING INTO THE GENERAL FUND, I WANT TO START OUT WITH A FEW BASIC ASSUMPTIONS.  ON THE REVENUE SIDE YOU RECALL THE GENERAL FUND IS PRIMARILY SUPPORTED BY PROPERTY TAXES. THE PROPERTY TAX ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE HAVE ARE THAT THEY WILL GO UP BY ABOUT 2.6% IN BOTH 22 AND 23. THAT'S COMPOSED OF THE INFLATION RATE WHICH HAS BEEN RUNNING AROUND 2%, MAYBE A LITTLE LESS, AND SOME ASSUMED CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY. IN ADDITION TO THAT THE NEXT LARGEST SOURCE OF REVENUE IS WHAT WE CALL STATE SHARED REVENUES WHICH IS BASED ON SALES TAXES.  WE ASSUME THAT IS FLAT FOR EACH YEAR FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS, ONE OF WHICH IS YOU HAVE A POLICY THAT IF IT DOES GROW THAT WILL HELP GENERATE SOME REVENUES FOR NON-REOCCURRING USES IN THE FUTURE.  BUT IT ALSO IS REFLECTIVE OF THE FACT THAT THE STATE HAS TO APPROVE PART OF THAT REVENUE AND WE'RE NEVER QUITE SURE WHAT THE STATE'S GOING TO APPROVE. THE OTHER MAJOR COMPONENT IS MONEY THAT THE CITY RECEIVES FROM PARKING, DOWNTOWN PARKING. NOW, SOME OF THAT COMES FROM THE DDA, SOME OF IT COMES FROM PARKING TICKETS. DURING THE PANDEMIC BOTH OF THOSE HAVE BEEN SEVERELY IMPACTED. OUR PROJECTIONS FOR THE 22 FISCAL YEAR IS A 27% REDUCTION IN THAT REVENUE, AND THEN 2023 WE ASSUME A MODEST INCREASE FROM THERE. WE ROLL ALL OF THAT TOGETHER, WE'RE REVENUE FOR THE GENERAL FUND IS PROJECTED TO GO DOWN A LITTLE LESS THAN 1 PERCENT IN 22, AND THEN GO ABOUT 2.8 PERCENT IN 23. WHEN WE LOOK AT A BUDGET WE COMPARE OUR REVENUES WITH WHAT OUR EXPENDITURES ARE. OUR EXPENDITURES FOR FORECASTING PURPOSES HAVE THE FOLLOWING ASSUMPTIONS. SO WE HAVE FORECASTED THE OPERATIONS THAT WE HAVE TO CONTINUE FORWARD.  WHAT THAT MEANS IS WE ARE TAKING OUR LABOR CONTRACTS AND OUR ASSUMPTION FOR WAGE INCREASES FOR EVERYONE, AND ROLL THAT FORWARD FOR EACH OF THE TWO YEARS. WE'VE ALSO, YOU MAY RECALL THAT FOR THIS FISCAL YEAR, ONE YEAR THAT WE SAVE MONEY, WAS TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF CONTRIBUTIONS WHAT WE CALL SUPPLEMENTAL CONTRIBUTIONS OR AMOUNT OF RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTIONS OVER AND ABOVE THE MINIMUM, WE REDUCE THOSE COMPLETELY TO HELP SAVE MONEY THIS YEAR. WHEN WE DO OUR PROJECTIONS FOR FISCAL 22 AND 23, WE RESTORE THOSE LEVELS OF CONTRIBUTIONS BECAUSE, IN FACT, AS WE WERE MAKING THEM, WE FELT LIKE THEY WERE MINIMUMS AND STILL FEEDED TO GO HIGHER. SO OUR BASELINE ASSUMPTION IS IS TO ININCLUDE RETURN BACK TO THOSE POLICY LEVELS.  WE'VE ALSO CAST CASTED HEALTHCARE POLICY INCREASES AND ASSET REPLACEMENTS LIKE SETTING ASIDE RESERVINGS TO REPLACE THE ROOF, THE BUILDING, THESE KINDS OF THINGS.  WE HAD SUSPENDED THAT CONTRIBUTION AS WELL AND IN FISCAL 22 AND 23, OUR BASELINE ASSUMPTION RESUMES RESTORING THAT CONTRIBUTION. LASTLY, THERE'S FIRE GRANT, FIRE PROTECTION GRANT THAT WE GET FROM THE STATE THAT HAD A MILLION DOLLAR SUPPLEMENT TO IT. WE CONSIDERED THAT A ONE-TIME ITEM, AND WE HAVE ASSUMED THAT HAS COME IN AND THAT GOES BACK OUT TO SUPPORT THE FIRE STATION REPLACEMENT PLAN. SO THOSE ARE THE THE THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE HAVE, AS YOU CAN IMAGINE WE'LL SEE IN A MOMENT CONTINUING OPERATIONS FORWARD WITH THESE ASSUMPTIONS AND WE COMPARE THAT WITH THE REVENUES WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A DEAF K-T. BEFORE I LEAVE THIS SLIDE, I DID WANT TO HIGHLIGHT FOR YOU, SOME OF THE REVENUE CHALLENGES THAT THE CITY HAS. THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN INVOLVED WITH GOVERNMENT FOR QUITE SOME TIME KNOW THAT IN MICHIGAN THERE IS A SET OF LAWS THAT MAKE LOCAL GOVERNMENT REVENUES CHALLENGING TO BE SUSTAINABLE IN THE LONG-TERM. ONE OF THOSE IS HEADLEY.  THE HEADLEY ROLL BACK TAKE YOURS PROPERTY TAX RATE AND REDUCES IT IN CERTAIN YEARS SO TAT THE MAXIMUM YOU CAN LEVY GOES DOWN WHEN THERE'S GROWTH ABOVE ESTABLISHED RATES. IN OTHER WORDS, IN CITY CHARTER, IF YOU OPEN UP AND READ IT, YOU'LL SEE THAT WE HAVE THREE MILLAGES THAT FUND THE GENERAL FUND. THE GENERAL OPERATING MILLAGE, A TRANSPORTATION MILLAGE, WHICH IS REALLY HOW WE SUPPORT THE TRIPLE ATA OR THE RIDE, AND A RETIREMENT BENEFIT MILLAGE. THOSE MILLAGES WERE PROVED BY THE VOTERS AT 12.5 MILLS MANY, MANY YEARS GO.  THE EFFECT OF HEADLEY HAS REDUCED THE MAXIMUM THEY CAN LEVY TO 9.7. I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT AS JUST AN EXAMPLE OF ONE OF THE CONSTRAINTS THAT WE HAVE ON REVENUE. THE FACT OF THIS IS THAT IT REDUCES THE ABILITY TO THE CAP WHEN YOU HAVE WEAKNESS BUT IT DOES NOT ALLOW YOU TO POP BACK UP WHEN YOU HAVE GROWTH. ONE OF THE KEY SLIDES I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU IS THIS ONE.  I WILL TAKE JUST A MINUTE ON THIS TO HOW THE GENERAL FUND OUTLOOK, HOW WE LOOK AT IT.  I'M GOING TO FOCUS ON THE BOX, WHICH IS THE FISCAL YEAR 22.  ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE WE HAVE REOCCURRING REVENUES AND EXPENDITURES IS THE FIRST FEW ROADS AND THEN WE LOOK AT ONE-TIME REVENUES AND EXPENDITURES.  WE SEEK TO BALANCE OUR ONE-TIME REVENUES AND EXPENDITURES.  THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR WHAT WE CALL STRUCTURAL BALANCE TO A BUDGET. SO WHEN WE DO THAT INITIAL PROJECTIONS OF FISCAL 22, THEY SHOWED A REOCCURRING DEFICIT OF $1.2 MILLIONS. THAT IS NOT UNCOMMON GIVEN THAT EVERY YEAR WE SEEM T HAVE A DEFICIT BECAUSE THE FACT OUR EXPENDITURES TEND TO GO UP IN THAT 2 T 3 PCENT RANGE, AND GO FROM O AND A HALF TO TWOT AND A HALF PERCENT  WE MIGHT GET A SMALL STRUCTURAL DEFICIT COLU TO ECONOMI.  THIS IST MOVI FORWARD WITUR RECASTED ASSPTIONS ON WHAT'S PPENED SO THIS IS WHERE SOME OFHE COVID STUFF CES IN AND OTHER ECOMIC ASSPTIONS. A SS OF  MILLIONR A USE OA FU BALANCE TT WOU BE NEED O $3 LLION. TODDRESS THAT, W THEN WENT TO STF AND SAID OKAY, LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT OUR EXISTING SERVICES, WHICH I'M KNOW GOING TO CALL OUR CORE SERVICES FOR THIS PRESENTATION, AND LET'S TAKE OUT 5%.  LET'S SEE WHAT THOSE IDEAS WOULD BE AND YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR ABOUT THOSE IDEAS AS WE GO THROUGH THIS PRESENTATION.  ALL ALL OF THOSE IDEAS ARE POSSIBLE AND IMPLEMENTABLE THAT WOULD GENERATE ABOUT $3.4 MILLION. THAT WOULD COVER OUR DEFICIT THAT WE HAD. HOWEVER, ALONG WITH THE REQUEST TO CUT THE 5%, STAFF ALSO HAD THE ABILITY TO SAY IF THEY NEED SOMETHING TO ENHANCE THE SERVICES OR SUSTAIN THE SERVICES THEY HAVE, THEY ALSO HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO ALSO ASK FOR FUNDS. WHEN THEY DID THAT, THAT WAS $1.2 MILLION. THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE THERE. LASTLY, I TRIED TO INTEGRATE INTO THIS PRESENTATION, AS HAS STAFF, THE STRATEGIC PLAN THAT WE DISCUSSED BACK IN DECEMBER. I REALIZED THAT WAS A DRAFT PLAN THAT HAS NOT YET BEEN ADOPTED BY COUNCIL BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS USEFUL TO DEMONSTRATE HOW THAT CAN INTERFACE WITH THE BUDGET AND HELP DRIVE THE DISCUSSION. THE COLUMN THAT NEXT COLUMN SAYS IF ASKED STAFF IF YOU WANT, IF WE WANT TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS IN THE STRATEGIC PLAN, WHAT RESOURCES WOULD YOU NEED IN ORDER TO TO ACHIEVE THE GOALS. YOU'LL SEE IN THAT COLUMN A VERY SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY OF $4.1 MILLION.  MOST OF THAT, AS YOU'LL SEE, COMES FROM SOME NEW ACTIONS BUT WE WILL WALK THROUGH THAT IN THE PRESENTATION.  SO LASTLY, IF WE WERE TO DO, IF WE COULD TAKE ALL THE SAVINGS THATWORK BROUGHT UP AND THOUGHT ABOUT AND PROVIDE ALL THE RESOURCES THAT WERE REQUESTED WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A DEFICIT OF 4 MILLION-DOLLARS. UNASSIGNED FUND BALANCE OUR FUND BALANCE WOULD DROP FROM ITS PRESENT 19% DOWN TO 15% AT THE END OF 22, AND 9% AT THE END OF 23. OUR GUIDELINE FOR OUR FUND BALANCE IS 15 TO 20%. HOW DO WE DEAL WITH THAT?  WELL, WHEN WE GET PROJECTIONS LIKE THIS WITH THE DEFICIT THIS YEAR WE TRIED A NEW BUDGETING ON TOP OF THE NORMAL EFFORTS THAT WE DO.  THIS IS CALLED PRIORITY-BASED BUDGETING.  STAFF WENT THROUGH A NUMBER OF EXERCISES IN ORDER TO COME UP WITH IDEAS AND WE LOOKED CROSS-DEPARTMENTALLY.  IN OTHER WORDS MANAGERS WHO ARE ALWAYS IN THEIR BUSINESS COME UP WITH IDEAS IN OUR NORMAL PROCESS. THIS PROCESS SOLICITED IDEAS THROUGH THE ORGANIZATION, WE CAN COMMENT ON OTHER PEOPLE'S AREAS THAT IS PROS AND CONS.  IT GIVES YOU A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE, BUT IT ALSO GENERATE IDEAS THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE PRACTICAL TO BE IMPLEMENTED.  SO ANYWAY, GOING THROUGH THIS IDEA THE PURPOSE OF THIS IS REALLY THREE-FOLD. FIRST, YOU WANT TO IDENTIFY AREAS OF SAVORINGS.  AREAS THAT YOU CAN REALLY BECOME MORE EFFICIENT. SECONDLY, IF THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES TO REALLOCATE COSTS FROM ONE PRIOR TO A FOURTH, WE LOOK FOR THOSE. IF YOU CAN'T SOLVE YOUR PROBLEM, REALLOCATION, THEN YOU LOOK AT NEW REV FEWS. SO, WHEN WE WENT THROUGH THIS PROCESS THERE WERE IDEAS THAT WE HAD OVER A HUNDRED IDEAS TO START WITH.  AS THEY GOT VETTED WE RESULTED IN 48 IDEAS FOR REDUCING COSTS OR IMPROVING SERVICES.  THOSE IDEAS WERE PROVIDED TO EACH OF THE SERVICE ADMINISTRATORS TO CONSIDER AS THEY FORMULATED IMPACTS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE IN THIS PRESENTATION.  AS YOU'VE SEEN IN THE FINANCIAL SIDE, WE'RE IN A POSITION WHERE THE CITY EXCEEDS THE RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE. I TRY TO INTEGRATE THE STRATEGIC PLAN.  THIS SLIDE JUST REMINDS YOU THE DRAFT STRATEGIC PLAN HAD SIX GOALS AND I'VE LISTED THEM HERE, OUR OBJECTIVES HAD DEFINED SMART MEASURES ATTACHED TO THEM SO AS WE GO THROUGH THE PRESENTATION, YOU'LL SEE IMPACT SHEETS BROKEN INTO TWO KINDS OF IMPACTS.  THERE WILL BE A GREEN SET OF GREEN SLIDES THAT INVOLVE IMPACTS FOR THE STRATEGIC PLAN AND A SET OF BLUE SIDES THAT REFLECT WHAT IT WOULD TAKE IF WE TOOK 5% OUT OF THE ORGANIZATION. NOW, THE 5% ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS, ARE NOT REALLY THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THE SERVICE AREA ADMINISTRATORS WOULD COMPLETELY AGREE TO OR RECOMMEND.  YOU WILL HEAR THEM DESCRIBED HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS AS WE GO THROUGH IT. HOWEVER, IT IS IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WE WOULD HAVE TO DO IN ORDER TO TAKE 5% OUT AND HAVE THE LEAST IMPACT OF SERVICES. SO, THE FIRST IMPACT IS OUR SMALLEST DEPARTMENT, MAYOR AND COUNCIL.  IN ORDER TO TAKE FUNDS OUT OF THIS AREA, THERE'S REALLY NOT MUCH HERE TO DO.  THE MAYOR HAS WHAT WE CALL THE MAYORAL COIN, A POSITIVE NUMBER HERE MEANS WE NEED TO EXPEND MONEY, AND A NEGATIVE MONEY MEANS WE WOULD SAVE MONEY. WE ARE ABOUT TO USE UP THE SUPPLY OF THESE COINS WHICH HO USES IN HIS OFFICIAL CAPACITY SO AN IMPACT WOULD BE TO REIS THE THAT SUPPLY. THEN SECONDLY, YOU MAY REMEMBER YOU EACH HAVE 500-DOLLARS FOR CONFERENCE, TRAVEL, AND TRAINING. EACH COUNCIL MEMBER DOES. IN ORDER TO TAKE MONEY OUT, THIS IS AN ITEM THAT WE COULD HAVE AS AN IMPACT IN ORDER TO REMOVE THE 5,500-DOLLARS FOR EACH OF THE COUNCIL MEMBERS IN YOUR AREA. THE CITY ADMINISTRATORS AREA I'LL TAKE YOU THROUGH THE FORMAT IN MORE DETAIL THAT WE HAVE, I REMIND YOU THE CITY ADMINISTRATORS AREA INCLUDES THE COMMUNICATIONS, HR, CITY CLERK, SAFETY, SUSTAINABILITY AND INNOVATIONS WHICH WIVE. ACTUALLY PULLED OUT AND REALLY SUSTAINABILITY AND INNOVATIONS WHICH WE'VE ACTUALLY - - THE DRAFT THAT YOU HAD EARLIER, IT WON'T 22 IS WHEN WE DO OUR BIANNUAL RESIDENT SURVEY.  WE WOULD HAVE THOSE RESULTS HOWEVER ALL THE OTHER OBJECTIVES WERE PRACTICAL WERE REMOVED TO TWEE 2023 REFLECTING THAT OUR TWO-YEAR PLAN IS FOR 22 AND 23. THE UB ZEC -FS OF THE CITY ADMINISTRATORS AREA WOULD HAVE WOULD INCLUDE HAVING AN ANN ARBOR 90% OR HIGHER, DEVELOPING A STRATEGIC DDI, INCREASING DIVERSITY OF BUSINESSES OPERATING IN THE COMMUNITY, AND ESTABLISHING RESPONSE STANDARDS FOR OUR CITYWIDE CUSTOMER SERVICE. THERE'S A FEW MORE HERE, WE WOULD INTERNALLY WE WOULD ALSO HAVE A WORK PLACE THAT HAS ZERO DESKS AND RECORDABLE INJURIES. WE WOULD IMPLEMENT PLANS FOR CAREER DEVELOPMENT AND A FAIR CONVERSATION PROGRAM WITH BENCHMARKS. GOING BACK TO THE BIANNUAL SURVEY WE'D ALSO HAVE A 60% OF OUR RESIDENT INDICATE THEY HAVE OVERALL CONFIDENCE IN THE GOVERNMENT.  WHILE THAT MAY SEEM LOW TO YOU THAT IS THE HIGHEST AMOK ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT SO WE THOUGHT IT WASN'T IMPORTANT TO KEEP THAT IN FRONT OF EVERYONE AND LASTLY, IT WOULD BE TO HAVE A REOCCURRING EXPENDITURES VERSUS REVENUES. THOSE ARE THE STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES -TS.  FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I BELIEVE WE CAN PURSUE ALL OF THOSE OBJECTIVES WITH THE EXISTING RESOURCES THAT BOW HAVE.  MOST OF THE WORK TO ACHIEVE THOSE WOULD BE FOCUSING ON THOSE OBJECTSIVES AS WE DO OUR WORK. THE ONLY THING THAT WE WOULD REQUEST RESOURCES FOR WOULD BE THE NATIONAL CITIZENS SURVEY. THAT IS THE SURVEY WE CALL THE BIANNUAL CITIZEN SURVEY AND THAT IS DONE EVERY OTHER YEAR SO WE'D LOOK FOR 30,000-DOLLARS IN FISCAL 22. THE STRATEGIC PLAN THEN, I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE CORE SERVICES. THE CORE SERVICES HAS A SIMILAR TYPE FORMAT BUT IT WILL BE IN BLUE FOR EACH OF THE DEPARTMENTS.  I'M NOT GOING TO COVER THIS IN ANY DETAIL BUT OUR CORE SERVICES AS MEASURES AS WELL.  OUR CORE SERVICES MEASURES TEND TO BE WHAT IS OUR EFFICIENCY, WHAT IS OUR OUTPUT, HOW MANY THINGS ARE WE DOING, THERE ARE THINGS THAT WE ARE REQUIRED TO DO FOR OUR BUSINESS TYPICALLY. AND THE ONES THAT ARE LISTED IN THE PRESENTATION IS REALLY JUST A SAMPLE OF THE MANY, MEN A THAT WE HAVE. SO JUMPING TO THE IMPACTS FOR THE EXISTING OPERATIONS IN ORDER FOR THE TO GET THE 5% OUT THE THE ACITY ADMINISTRATORS OFFICE WOULD HAVE TO REDUCE LOBBYING SERVICES CONTRACT FROM 48,000 WHICH WE PRESENTLY HAVE, WE WOULD REDUCE THAT TO 5,000. RECOGNIZING THAT WE ARE MAKING CUTS EVERYWHERE, THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE'D STILL SEEK TO HAVE SOME SERVICES FROM, BUT WE WOULD ASK FOR AN ACCOMMODATION ON THE CONTRACT WHALE WE STRUGGLE THROUGH THIS FINANCIAL ENVIRONMENT. WE WOULD ALSO REDUCE THE BUDGETED AMOUNT THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE FOR THE ANNUAL COUNCIL WORKSHOPS.  WE'VE HAD SOME FACILITATION FUNDING SET ASIDE AND WE WOULD REDUCE THAT. AS WELL AS SOME FUNDS FOR A GOVERNMENTAL SERVICES WHICH ARE ACTIVITIES WE'VE USED TO SUPPORT OTHER PUBLIC MEETINGS AND THINGS LIKE THAT THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. THIS IS SOMETHING WE THOUGHT WE COULD TAKE OUT.  FOR THE CITY CLERKS OFFICE, THEY'D ASSUME A 35,000-DOLLAR INCREASE IN REVENUE.  WHAT YOU'LL SEE IS A NEGATIVE HERE BECAUSE THAT IS LIKE AN EXPENSE REDUCTION BASICALLY FOR US IF WE INCREASE REVENUE.  SO IT'S FROM A NET BASE IT DOES THE SAME THING. IT INCREASES THE REVENUES OR DECREASES IN EXPENSES ARE NEGATIVES.  ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE I SHOULD MENTION YOU'LL SEE AN R IF IT'S REOCCURRING OR O IF IT'S ONE TIME. WE TALKED ABOUT THAT EARLIER IN THE SUMMARY SLIDE AND THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. THE OTHER THING THE CLERK'S OFFICE WOULD DO IS REDUCE ITS SUPPLIES WHICH WE RENAMED TO COMMUNITY ACADEMY. THIS COMES WITH SOME HESITATION JUST PAUSE THIS ACADEMY HAS PROVED QUITE REWARDING FOR STAFF AND THE RESIDENTS THAT KNOW THROUGH IT, AND THERE'S A BIT OF A BONDING THAT GOES THROUGH THAT WHEN THEY GO THROUGH THAT CLASS AND THAT COMES WITH MATERIALS AND SUPPLIES AND MAYBE SOME TREATS AND STUFF LIKE THAT.  WE WOULD TAKE THAT STUFF OUT, WHH IS REFLECTIVE OF WHERE WE ARE IN A ZOOM ENVIRONMENT BUT I DON'T KNOW IF WE' BE THAT WAY THROUGH THE WHOLE YEAR, BUT WE WOULD HAVE TO REMOVE THOSE.  WE'D STILL HAVEHE PROGRAM BUT WITHOUT SOME OF THOSE OTHER E COMMENT IS SOMETNG THAT YOU HAVEN YOUR AGENDA.  THOSE COENTS, YOU KNOW, WE'VE INSTUTED THA WEAY FOR THAT EXTRA SERVICE. E COULDEVIE -T THE EFFECTINESS OF TT AND WHETHER YOU'RE REALLY GETTING FROMHAT AND REMING THATS HOPED SOMETHING WE COULD DO FOR ABO - - 2,8-DOLLARS SAVINGS. THELECTIONS WEON'T HAVE IN O WE CAN TAKE OUT SE MONEY THERE. EET ANDUSILS. HAVE A A LITTLE T -F TEMP THAT HEL US WIT REPAIRS ANDME MAINTENC ANDCTUALLY TING THE TEMP PAY OUT HAS AN IMPACT FOR THE ABILITY OF STAFF TO KEEP UP WITH THE ISSUES THAT RISE. WE WOULD ALSO COULD REDUCE PROFESSIONAL SERVICES AND CONTRACTED SERVICES TO 84,000-DOLLARS FOR ANY INTERNAL RENOVATIONS THAT WE DO THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING GOING ON IN OUR FACILITIES NOT JUST CITY HALL BUT OTHER ONES.  PRESENTLY WE HANDLE THOSE THROUGH IF THEY'RE GENERAL FUND RELATED WE HANDLE THEM THROUGH THIS ACCOUNT CENTRALLY.  WHAT WE COULD DO IS JUST ELIMINATE THAT CONTRACT OR BUDGET AND HAVE EACH DEPARTMENT DO THAT INDIVIDUALLY.  IT'S LESS EFFICIENT, BUT IT'S SOMETHING WE CONSIDER DOING IF WE NEEDED TO. NOW, THERE'S A SERIES OF POSITIVE NUMBERS HERE MEANING THESE ARE ACTIONS ONE-TIME ACTIONS THAT ARE REQUESTS FOR SERVICE. THE CITY HALL'S HVAC SYSTEM IS VERY OLE AND FOR THOSE WHO AREN'T FAMILIAR WITH IT, IT HAS PNEUMATIC CONTROLS SOME OF WHICH HAVE BROKEN AND IT'S A CONSTANT ERROR FLOW TYPE SYSTEM. IT'S INEFFICIENT AND IT CREATES AN UNCOMFORTABLE ENVIRONMENT TO WORK IN. THIS IDEA ACTUALLY CAME THROUGH OUR PBB EXERCISE WHERE STAFF SAID THIS OUGHT TO BE SOMETHING THAT WE FIX.  THE SYSTEM IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY IS 60 YEARS OLD OR SOMETHING BUT IT'S QUITE INEFFICIENT. THE AIR DUCT CLEANING.  WE'RE NAT SURE THE AIR DUCTS IN CITY HALL HAVE EVER BEEN CLEANED, TO BE HONEST.  IT'S CERTAINLY BEEN DECADES.  IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE WE WERE DEALING WITH COVID AND YOU MAY RECALL THAT PEOPLE WERE UPDATING THEIR AIR HANDLING SYSTEMS.  WE WERE LOOKING AT THUS SAYING WE REALLY OUGHT TO DO THIS SO THIS WAS PUT ON AS A REQUEST AS AS WELL. THE EXTERIOR SHELL OF THE BUILDING IS COMPOSED OF MAINLY OF GLASS AT CITY HALL.  THERE WAS A CONCEPT THAT WAS DEVELOPED WHEN THE COURT POLICE BUILDING WAS, THE JUSTICE CENTER WAS BUILT WHERE THE TOP FLOOR WHICH IS THE LARGEST FLOOR PLATE WOULD BE SOME OTHER MEASURE IN ORDER TO TAKE THIS 1940, 50S, OR 60S TECHNOLOGY FOR WALLS AND ACTUALLY INSOLATE THEM THERE'S NOT REALLY INSULATION THERE AND THE WALLS AND WINDOWS ARE NOT OF MODERN QUALITY AT ALL. LASTLY THE FIRE STATION 1 ALARM SYSTEM'S 40 YEARS OLD AND IT IS GOT PARTS THAT ARE FAILING AS WELL.  AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE REPLACED. SO WE CERTAINLY RUN THINGS FOR THEIR USEFUL LIFE AND PAST THEM HERE AT THE CITY. WHEN IT COMES TO A FACILITY PERSPECTIVE.  HUMAN RESOURCES AREA WE WOULD LOOK AT TRANSFER SOME OF THE EXPENSES RELATED TO BENEFITS OVER TO OUR RISK FUND WHERE WE CONSOLIDATE ALL OF OUR BENEFIT COSTS AND FOR THE SAFETY UNIT WE WOULD RIGHT SIZE THE TRAVEL AND TRAINING BUDGET COMPARED TO WHAT THEY'VE BEEN SPENDING. THOSE ARE THE IMPACTS WE WOULD HAVE IN THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR AREA AND WE WOULD, AND THOSE REPRESENT A REQUEST IN THE REDUCTIONS THAT WE COULD DO TO HIT THE TARGETS THAT WERE MENTIONED. ARE. THE LAST SLIDE FOR THIS AREA IS HORIZON ISSUES.  WHAT DOES EACH AREA SEE WHEN THEY LOOK FORWARD THESE ARE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES WE'RE GOING TO BE FACING AS WE MOVE FORWARD.  THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR AREA IS GOING TO BE DEAL WITHING THIS POST-COVID ARMET VIEW AND WHAT THAT MEANS OPERATIONALLY.  WE DON'T THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE SMOOTH AND EASY WE'RE ALLRED IN THE FLOW THROW OF THAT. THINK ABOUT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, IT'S NOT SOMETHING WE'VE GOT A LOT OF RESOURCES BEHIND, BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT AS WE LOOK AT COMING OUT OF THIS PANDEMIC THAT NEEDS GREATER FOCUS. WE ALSO IN THIS ENVIRONMENT WITH A LOT OF STIMULUS FUNDS AND A LOT OF POLICYIC EWES THAT ARE CHANGING LEDGE SLOTTIVE LOBBYING EFFORTS ARE GOING TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT TO SUCCESS AS WE MOVE FORWARD. DEVELOPING A STRATEGIC PLAN FOR THE DEI, MENTIONED. SUCCESSION PLANNING IS SOMETHING FROM A LEADERSHIP PERSPECTIVE WE NEED TO KEEP OUR EYE ON AND IMPLEMENT AT THE i PROPERTY TIME. THEN LASTLY, MOVING THESE CITY STRATEGIC PLAN, THE DRAFT FORWARD TO SOME KIND OF ADOPTION OF COUNCIL.  THOSE ARE THE ISSUES THAT I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT FROM THE CITY ADMINISTRATORS AREA.  WE'LL START GOING THROUGH OTHER AREAS OF THE GENERAL FUND NOW. I'M GOING TO ASK MR. HORNING TO JOIN THE ROOM.  I WILL CONTINUE TO OPERATE THE SLIDES. MA, IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO TELL ME WHEN TO MOVE FORWARD.
00:27:57.590: >> MATT SHOULD BE JOINING US IN JUST A SECOND.  -RPB.
00:28:05.164: >> MR. HORNING:  GOOD EVENING MAYOR AND COUNCIL, MR. CRAWFORD, HOW ARE YOU?
00:28:08.400: >> GOOD.
00:28:08.834: >> MR. HORNING:  I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU THROUGH THE FINANCIAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES SECTION HERE.  RIGHT HERE WE'VE GOT OUR ORGANIZATIONAL CHART AND YOU CAN SEE IT'S COMPRISED OF ACCOUNTING, PROCUREMENT, ASSESSING, FINANCE AND BUDGET, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, TREASURY, AND RISK MANAGEMENT. AND MY SESSION HERE WILL GO THROUGH ALL OF THOSE EXCEPT FOR IT WHICH WILL BE PRESENTED JUST AFTER MY SECTION. HERE WE'VE GOT THE FINANCE STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES FIRST THAT THE CITY IS BEING MANAGED AND SECOND THAT WE DELIVERING EXCEPTIONAL CORE SERVICES AND DO THOSE THINGS THAT WE MEASURE GEO BOND RATING DOUBLE A PLUS AND REOCCURRING REVENUES AND EXPENDITURES ARE BALANCED.  THEN BY 22 WE'D WANT TO PUBLISH AN ANNUAL REPORT THAT GOES OVER ALL OF OUR CORE SERVICES. FOR OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES, WE ARE NOT ASKING FOR ANY ADDITIONAL INCREMENTAL RESOURCES TO ACHIEVE THOSE. HERE WE'VE GOT OUR CORE SERVICES FOR FINANCE SO SUSTAINABLE FINANCIAL STANDARDS WE LOOK TO OUR AUDIT TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE ZERO MATERIAL WEAKNESSES, WITH ZERO SIGNIFICANT DEFICIENCIES. WE MET THOSE TWO WITH RESPECT TO THE CITY'S CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  WE DO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT DEFICIENCY IN OUR CITY AUDIT RELATED TO A LATE PAYMENT TO US FROM ANOTHER GOVERNMENT. WE LOOK TO KEEP OUR EXCEPTIONAL BOND RATINGS AS DOUBLE A PLUS FOR THE CITY AND FOR SOOER AND WE'RE AT DOUBLE A FOR WATER.  WE WANT TO ALIGN OUR RESOURCES. AGAIN THAT WE HAVE NO STRUCTURAL DEFICIT, THAT WE ARE FUND BALANCE WIND AND FALLACY RIGHT NOW WE'RE A LITTLE BIT ABOVE THAT AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR PENSION TRUST ARE FUNDED APPROPRIATELY. OUR GOAL IS TO HAVE 100% FUNDING.  WE ARE AT 84 AND 67 PERCENT RESPECTIVELY. I'LL POINT OUT THAT THOSE ARE EXCEPTIONAL IN RELATION TO OUR PEER CITIES. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE SUSTAINABLE AND STRONG FINANCE RANCE TEAM.  AT THIS POINT WE ARE FULLY STAFFED WHICH IS THE FIRST TIME I CAN REMEMBER THAT IN QUITE SOME TIME, AND WE DO HAVE SUCCESSION PLANNING IN PLACE. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S EQUITABLE, ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND AS COUNCIL KNOWS WE JUST ADOPTED OUR NEW POVERTY EXEMPTION GUIDELINES AND WE'RE WORKING WITH IT AND WITH SPARK AND LDFA TO CONSTRUCT FIBER OPTIC IN THE CITY. WE WANT TO DO TRANSFORMATIVE INITIATIVES AND PBB IS ONE OF THOSE. SO PRESENTATION ON PBB A COUPLE OF WEEKS AFOE AT OUR WORK SESSION. THESE ARE IMPACTS TO ACHIEVE CORE SERVICES WITHIN FINANCE. THE FIRST INCREMENTAL REDUCTIONS IN VARIOUS LINE ITEMS LIKE LEGAL FEES AND THINGS LIKE THAT. THE LAST ONE IN ORDER TO MEET THAT 5 PERCENT TARGET IS POTENTIAL LAYOFF AND RETIREMENT WE'VE GOT A RETIREMENT IN A TIMELY WAY WE COULD AVOID A LAYOFF BUT WITHOUT RETIREMENT WE WOULD HAVE TO LOOK TO LAYING OFF AN EMPLOYEE AND THAT POSITION IS NOT YET BEEN IDENTIFIED. ASIDE FROM THE FINANCE SIDE WE HAVE WHAT'S CALLED CITY WIDE OR HOUSED WITHIN THE GENERAL FUND AND THE FIRST THREE ITEMS THERE ARE SIMILARLY ARE VARIOUS INCREMENTAL REDUCTIONS TO A FEW LINE ITEMS. AND THEN THE FINAL ONE THERE IS A BIG ONE.  WE CAN ELIMINATE OR REDUCE OUR TRANSFER TO OUR CAPITAL SINKING FUND WHICH TAKES CARE OF CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS OF GENERAL FUND OWNED FACILITIES. FINALLY WE'VE GOT OUR HORIZON ISSUES.  THESE WILL LOOK SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO MR. CRAWFORD'S.  WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE SUCCESSION PLANNING TRAINING AND ORGANIZATIONAL DEVELOPMENT IMPLEMENTED.  WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR PBB PROCESS IS INTEGRATED SEEMLESSLY INTO OUR BUDGETING PROCESS FOR THE CITY. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE MAINTAIN HEALTH AND SUSTAINABILITY OF OUR PENSION IN OUR VEBA.  OBVIOUSLY SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUSTAINABILITY INITIATIVES WITHIN THE CITY. AND MOST CHALLENGING IS NAVIGATING FINANCIAL CHALLENGES OF COVID-19 AND LOOKING TO DO SO FOR POST-PANDEMIC REALITIES AS WELL.
00:33:05.898: >> THANK YOU, AND, UM, MATT, AND NEXT JACKIE WE HAVE IN COUNCIL WE HAVE TOM WHO IS THE CITY'S IT DIRECTOR.
00:33:36.462: >> TOM:  HI, EVERYBODY.  CAN YOU HEAR ME?
00:33:39.731: >> YES.
00:33:40.599: >> TOM:  GOOD EVENING, HI MR. MAY, COUNCIL, AND MR. CRAWFORD.  FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE IS REALLY UNIVERSAL ACCESS AND INFORMATION TO COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY. YOU KNOW, WE'VE BEEN WORKING VERY HARD SINCE 2017 BUILDING OUR OWN FIBER NETWORK AND CURRENTLY WORKING UNDER AN LDFA GRANT TO DO A TECHNOLOGY PARK IN DOWNTOWN.  ANNEERER.  BUT OUR GOAL IS REALLY TO GET A GOOD COMMUNICATIONS IN - - INFRASTRUCTURE IN FOR THE CITY AND THE COMMUNITY CAN TAKE PLACE AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF TECHNOLOGY. AS FAR AS THE IMPACTS TO THAT STRATEGY, AT THIS TIME WE ARE NOT ASKING FOR ANY INCREMENTAL RESOURCES.  BUT AS OUR FIBER AND OUR COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK EXPANDS AND IS DEPLOYED AND WE DO HAVE CUSTOMERS ON IT SO WE DO OFFER IT AS A SERVICE THESE DAYS, ITS GOING TO CTINUE TO GR AND IN THE FUTURE W ARE GOING  NEED PROJECT MANAGEMENT AN ADMINISTRATION TO B ABLE TO MANAGE T EESS CAPACY AND THE CUSTOMERS THAT WE BRING ON TO THEOMMUNICATION NETRK.
00:35:03.048: >> I'M JUSTOING TO MENTION AT WHENOU SAID CUSTOMERS CUSTOMERS, NOT INDIVIDUALS.
00:35:12.524: >> YEAH, YH.  SORRY. SO AS FAR AS O CORE SERVICES OWTHE FIR TWO A PLICATIONS TOELIVER TEAM D ENRPRISEUPPORT TEAM. THEY SUPPORT ALL OF OUR BUSINESS UNITS AND OUR LINE OF BUSINESS APPLICATIONS AND WOE DO WHAT WE DO IS WE HAVE A PROJECT METHODOLOGY WHERE WE DEPLOY PROJECTS.  EVERY TIME WE DO A PROJECT WE USE THE METHODOLOGY AND AS A RESULT OF THE PROJECT WE DO A CLOSURE SURVEY TO NUMBER ONE MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE MEETING THE BUSINESS NEEDS OF EACH ONE OF THE PROJECTS, AND THEN THE OVERALL CUSTOMER SATISFACTION OF THE PROJECT.  TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE WE'RE HITTING THE TARGET WHEN WE DO THOSE PROJECTS. ON THE, YEAH, ON THE HELP DESK UNDER THE HELP DESK WE ALSO DO AN ANNUAL CUSTOMER SATISFACTION SURVEY AND OUR GOAL IS TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S OVER 90, UH, 90% SATISFIED AND VERY SATISFIED WITH THE ORGANIZATION. AND THEN FROM INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICES, WHICH IS OUR DATA CENTER, ALL OF OUR SERVERS AND OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS, OUR GOAL IS TO KEEP THEM UP 96% OF THE TIME. AND OUR NETWORK SERVICES, WHICH CONNECTS ALL OF OUR LOCATIONS TOGETHER, OUR GOAL IS TO HAVE THAT UP 95 PERCENT OF THE TIME. REALLY THE GO IS TO MAKE SURE THAT TECHNOLOGY'S AVAILABLE TO ALL OF YOU ALL THE TIME. A FAR AS IMPACTS GO FOR THE IT DEPARTMENT, WE DO HAVE A NUMBER OF INTERN POSITIONS THAT WE USE AND THEY HELP US CAN PLOY COMPUTERS, THEY HELP US ADMINISTER OUR NETWORK. $76,000 OF SAVINGS THERE IF WE DIDN'T USE THOSE POSITIONS. REDUCING TRAINING FOR THE IT STAFF, I WILL SAY THAT YOU HAVE TRAINING FOR IT IS VERY, VERY IMPORTANT. TECHNOLOGY IS VERY COMPLEX THESE DAYS. AND IT'S VERY, VERY FAST-PACED. AND WE, AND THIS IS A 50% REDUCTION IN OUR TRAINING FOR THE IT DEPARTMENT. WE CAN, WE WERE DOING SOME CONFERENCE ROOM UPGRADES BEFORE COVID AND WE COULD ELIMINATE SOME OF THOSE UPGRADES NOW BECAUSE WE REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT THINGS ARE GOING TO LOOK LIKE AFTER COVID IS OVER. THEN OUR BIGGEST LINE ITEM HERE IS REALLY TWO FULL-TIME EMPLOYEES. THE LAYOFF OR THE ELIMINATION OF THOSE Y EMPLOYEES. IF THAT, IF THAT HAPPENS OUR LEVEL OF SERVICE WILL DEFINITELY GO DOWN BETWEEN THE INTERNS AND TWO FTES YOU KNOW, WE, WE DON'T DEPLOY LESS TECHNOLOGY THESE DAYS WE DEPLOY MORE TECHNOLOGY. SO IT WOULD TAKE A, IT WOULD HAVE A, AN IMPACT ON THE LEVEL OF SERVICE THAT YOU'RE PROVIDED TODAY AND OUR RESPONSE TIMES IF WE WERE TO, IF THE UM, CHANGES TO OUR FTES WOULD OCCUR. AND THEN THERE'S ALSO SOME OTHER SMALL PROJECTS OR SOFTWARE UTILITIES WE COULD ELIMINATE. WE WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT LESS SECURE AS AN ORGANIZATION, BUT YOU KNOW THE TOTAL COME OUT TO OR 5% CUTS WOULD UH 500,000-DOLLARS.  SO THAT'S EVERYTHING THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT TODAY. AS FAR AS OUR HORIZON ISSUES, YOU KNOW, CYBER SECURITY IS VERY, VERY CHALLENGING.  WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME.  WE ACTUALLY SPEND A LOT MORE MONEY ON CYBER SECURITY THAN WE EVER HAVE IN THE PAST TO KEEP OUR NETWORK SAFE. THE FUTURE WORKPLACE, TELECHUTING, COVID, WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THE NEW NORMAL IS GOING TO BE ONCE WE COME OUT OF THIS BUT TECHNOLOGY, YOU HAVE SEEN THAT THE TECHNOLOGY THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE TODAY ALLOWS PEOPLE TO WORK REMOTELY AND IT ALLOWS US TO BE FLEXIBLE.  AND SO WHEN WE COME OUT OF COVID, IT'S KIND OF DIFFICULT TO TELL WHAT THINGS ARE GOING TO LOOK LIKE AS AN ORGANIZATION FROM AN IT PERSPECTIVE. AND THEN, THE LAST TWO, THE DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION IS REALLY KIND OF TIED TO SMART CITIES AND THAT IS EVERYTHING'S CONNECTED THESE DAYS. AND THE REASON THAT WE'RE BUILDING THESE A COMMUNITY NETWORK AND REALLY STRONG ROBUST FOUNDATION, COMMUNICATIONS FOUNDATION IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN USE TECHNOLOGY AND WE CAN CONNECT PEOPLE AND WE CAN CONNECT BUILDINGS, WE CAN CONNECT DEVICES OUT IN THE FIELD THAT ALLOW US TO REMOTELY MANAGE AND OPERATE THINGS THAT WILL RESULT IN EPHESIANSS AND COST SAVINGS, BUT THEN ALSO SO WE CAN CAPTURE DATA FROM THE SYSTEMS THAT ARE OUT THERE SO WE CAN USE THAT TO MAKE GOOD BUSINESS DECISIONS AGAIN TO MAKE SURE THAT WE BECOME MORE EFFICIENT AND SAVE MONEY.
00:40:24.336: >> THANK YOU. UH, NEXT WE WANT TO GO INTO OUR SAFETY SERVICES AREA WHICH INCLUDES BOTH FIRE AND POLICE. AND THE FIRST WE HAVE CHIEF KENNEDY FOR FIRE.
00:40:37.315: >> CHIEF KENNEDY:  GOOD EVENING, MAYOR AND COUNCIL, MIKE KENNEDY, FIRE CHIEF, PLEASURE TO BE HERE GOOD EVENING. SO TO START OFF WITH FOR THE STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES THE BIG ONE WE HAVE FOR FIRE IS TRYING TO REPLACE STATION 4 WHICH IS IN THE SOUTHEAST SIDE OF THE CITY AND OUR GOAL WITH THIS IS ACTUALLY FOR THIS TO BE THE FIRST NET 0 FIRE STATION IN THE STATE OF MICHIGAN.  NATIONALLY THERE'S TWO BOTH OF WHICH ARE IN SALT LAKE CITY, AND THIS OBVIOUSLY TIES VERY CLOSELY WITH THE B20 INITIATIVE.  THE STATION NEEDS TO BE REPLACED AND WE CAN ALSO ACHIEVE SOME PRETTY PHENOMENAL SUSTAINABILITY RESULTS WHILE WE'RE AT IT. THE GOAL FOR THAT IS O TWO 2025. AS MR. CRAWFORD MENTIONED EARLIER IN THE EVENING, OUR FINANCE PROJECTIONS INCLUDE THIS ONE MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE STATE OF MICHIGAN FOR THE FIRE PROTECTION GRANT FUNDING AND THIS IS SINCE THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR COVERS THE PROPERTY OF THE STATE-OWNED PROPERTY WHICH IS THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN. THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN IN PLACE FOR SEVERAL DECADES. THEY PREVIOUSLY ONLY FUNDED THIS AT A VERY SMALL FRACTION OF WHAT IT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO BE, AND WE'RE GOING INTO THE SECOND YEAR WHERE WE'RE PROJECTED FOR IT TO BE FULLY FUNDED.  SO SOME POSITIVE NIES ON THAT BUT THAT MILLION DOLLARS IS ROLLED INTO OUR PROJECTION. THREES. THESE ARE SOME KIND OF CORE SERVICES, SIMILAR, WON'T SPEND A LOT OF TIME ON THESE TONIGHT. ONE OF THE BIG ONES UP ON THE TOP IS OUR SIX-MINUTE CITY-WIDE EMERGENCY RESPONSE TIME.  SO THIS FROM US BEING ALERTED, TURNOUT TIMES IN TRAVEL, AND WE ARE HITTING THIS METRIC RIGHT NOW AND THAT'S REALLY THE KEY FOR US FOR THAT FIRST UNIT ON CITYWIDE LESS THAN SIX MINUTES. SO FOR OUR IMPACTS THIS IS FOR THE 5%.  I WILL SAY THAT THE FIRE DEPARTMENT IS ALREADY QUITE LIEN.  WE'VE HAD A LOT OF REDUCTIONS OVER THE LAST, REALLY, 20 CAREERS AND COMPARED COMPARED TO BOTH STATE OF MICHIGAN AND EVEN KIND OF SOME NATIONAL CITIES WE'RE ON THE LOWER SIDE OF FTE PER THOUSAND POPULATION. OUR RECURRENT STAFFING ALLOWS FOR US TO DELIVER EXCELLENT FIRE SERVICES.  WE'RE AT THE POINT WHERE IF WE HAVE ADDITIONAL REDUCTION IN FTE THERE'S NOT WHOLE LOT WE CAN DO TO NOT HAVE DECREASE IN SERVICE. THE TOP LINE IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAD ANTICIPATED SO THIS IS ACTUALLY BEFORE THE REQUEST FOR THE 5%.  IN FISCAL 21 WE WERE BUDGETED FOR FOUR FIRING, THIS WILL REDUCE THAT TO THREE.  I FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE WE CAN HANDLE THAT REDUCTION TO THREE. LINE TWO IS THE REDUCTION OF YET ANOTHER FIRE INSPECTOR.  THIS WOULD PUT US AT ONE FIRE MARSHAL AND I SHOULD HAVE BACKED -P WE HAVE A FIRE PARTIAL AND FOUR INSPECTORS.  THE TOP LINE TAKES THAT TO THREE INSPECTORS, THE SECOND LINE TAKES THAT TO TWO INSPECTORS.  WE HAVE A REALLY HARD TIME MAINTAINING OUR INSPECTION ROTATION FREQUENCY SO THE LENGTH BETWEEN INSPECTIONS WITHED WOULD DECREASE PRETTY SIGNIFICANTLY IF WE LOST THAT SECOND POSITION WHICH WOULD GO DOWN FROM THREE INSPECTORS TO TWO. ON THE THIRD LINE, THIS YEAR WE WERE HOPING TO HIRE A FIRE RECRUIT.  WE HAD LITERALLY STARTED THAT PROCESS THIS TIME LAST YEAR AND THEN COVID HIT SO WE PUT THAT ON HOLD.  AND THE IDEA TO HIRE A FIRE RECRUIT POSITION IS SOMETHING TO BORROW FROM THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AND OTHER FIRE - - DEPARTMENTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY.  FOR ABOUT THE LAST 20 YEARS THE FIRE DEPARTMENT HAS ONLY HIRED FIREFIGHTERS WITH EXPERIENCE. THE CITY CAN SAVE AN AWFUL LOT OF MONEY WITH THIS, AND IT'S ABOUT A YEAR FOR SOMEBODY TO GET HIRED AND THEN FULLY TRAINED. WE DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DO A FIRE ACADEMY IN AN EMT CLASS, WE DON'T THEIR -T MANY PEOPLE TO JUSTIFY THAT EXPENSE.  GRAND RAPIDS, LANCING, AND DETROIT ARE THE ONLY THREE DEPARTMENTS IN THE STATE THAT ARE DOING THAT. BUT THEY HIRE 10, 20 FIREPEWTERS AT A TIME.  WE JUST DON'T HAVE THAT TYPE OF TURNOVER. WHAT WE'RE FINDING IS THE FIREFIGHTERS THAT ARE GRADUATING FROM FIRE ACADEMIES, THERE'S NOT LOT OF DIVERSITY.  SO BY US ONLY HIRING PEOPLE WITH TRAINING, WE'RE AUTOMATICALLY AT A DEFICIT OF TRYING TO RECRUIT EITHER BETTER GENDER OR RACIAL DIVERSITY FOR OUR DEPARTMENT. THE POLICE DEPARTMENT HAS HAD A LOT OF SUCCESS WITH THIS SO WE CAN NOT BEING BASHFUL AND THE POLICE HAVE HAD A LOT OF SUCCESS AND WE'RE JUST TRYING TO COP Y WHAT THEY DID.  SO IF WE WERE TO LOSE THAT RECRUIT POSITION, THAT REALLY WOULD GO KIND OF AS A DEFICIT TO SOME OF OUR DEI INITIATIVES. WE HAVE SOME VACANT FIREFIGHTER POSITIONS.  RIGHT NOW WE HAVE 72 FIREFIGHTERS ASSIGNED TO OUR SUPPRESSION, AND WITH THAT 72 THERE'S 24 ASSIGNED TO THREE SHIFTS. TWO OF THOSE SHIFTS WE WOULD DROP DOWN TO 23. THIS WOULD AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF FIREFIGHTERS AVAILABLE DAILY. WE WOULD MAINTAIN OUR MINIMUM STAFFING, BUT WHAT WE WOULD LIKELY SEE IS A DIRECT INCREASE IN OVER TIME.  SO THIS IS ONE THAT BY REDUCING THOSE FTE COUNT IF WE WANT TO MAINTAIN OUR DAILY STAFFING, WE'RE GOING TO SEE AN INCREASE IN OVERTIME JUST FOR WORKERS COMP, WE HAVE TO HAVE MORE FIREFIGHTERS IN OUR DAILY STAFFING.  AND OURAILY MINIMUM.  AND SO WE COULD DO THIS BUT AGAIN THE FALLO WOULD BE LIKELY INCREAS IN OVER TIME. THEAST ORHEXCUSE ME THE FIFTH NE DOWN THI IS USI SOME ALLOCIONS SOME ONE-TIME ALLOCATION OFHAT MONEY FROM AT FIRE PROCTION GNT TO COVER OPERATIAL EXPENSOR FISCAL 22.  AND THEN THE FINAL WITH OUR HORIZON ISSUES OURO REUE 1 ITHNIT IHE CIASEDUT OFTAON ONE IT IS OUR HIGST RESNSE VEHICLE  THE ENTIRE CITY AND THAT'S DUE TO FOR REPLACEMENT AND WE WANT TO DO AN ENHANCEMENT WHEN WE REPLACE THAT. NEXT SLIDE, PLEASE. SO FOR RESCUE 1-1, THE PICTURE OVER THE LEFT HAND SIDE IS THE CURRENT VEHICLE AND IT'S ON A PULL OUT TRAY.  THIS VEHICLE IS KIND OF A CONCEPT WHEN WE FIRST INITIATED IT AND IT'S WORKED OUT INCREDIBLY WELL.  WE OPERATE TWO SUPPRESSION COMPANIES OUT OF STATION ONE DOWNTOWN AND AGAIN THIS VEHICLE DOES 1600 CALLS BY ITSELF EVERY YEAR AND IT'S BEEN A TREMENDOUS ASSET TO US BUT ON A NIGHT LIKE TONIGHT WHERE IT'S SNOWING OUT OR ANY SORT OF RAIN OR THE FIRE WE HAD LAST NIGHT AT MILLER ALL OF THE EQUIPMENT IS ON THAT PULLOUT TRAY.  SO SNOW GETS ON IT, IT GETS WET, IT'S ONE OF THOSE KIND OF SOUNDED LIKE A GOOD IDEA AT THE TIME BUT IN HINDSIGHT NUT SO MUCH.  THE VEHICLE ON THE RIGHT IS WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO GO TO.  IT'S STILL A LIGHT RESPONSE UTILITY VEHICLE.  THE CITY OF KENTWOOD JUST EAST OF GRAND RAPIDS PUT THAT IN SERVICE THIS FALL FOR BASICALLY AN IDENTICAL SERVICE OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO AT ARCH ARBOR.  SO LIGHT RESPONSE EMS VEHICLE, BUT IT A HAS MUCH BETTER COMPARTMENTATION ON IT. UNFORTUNATELY THAT JUMP IS A BIG ONE. SO IT'S 110,000-DOLLARS. IT'S A ONE-TIME COST, THIS IS NOT ADDING ANY VEHICLES TO THE FLEET SO OUR TOTAL FLEET NUMBER STAYS THE SAME, IT'S JUST GETTING OUR FIREFIGHTERS A MUCH MORE FUNCTIONAL VEHICLE AND OUR EQUIPMENT ISN'T BEING EXPOSED TO THE ELEMENTS AS IT CURRENTLY IS. AND THEN ON A LARGER HORIZON ISSUE, THIS IS FOR FISCAL 23. SO FOR THE FIRE DEPARTMENT WE HAVE TWO RESERVE ENGINES.  OUR RESERVES ARE BOTH 16 YEARS OLD AND THEY HAVE OVER 100,000 MILES ON IT. A HUNDRED THOUSAND MILES FOR A FIRE TRUCK IS AN AWFUL LOT OF MILES AND 16 YEARS FOR A BUSY URBAN DEPART DEPARTMENT LUKE ANN ARBOR IS REALLY KIND OF END OF LIFE FOR RELIABILITY FOR FIRE ENGINES.  BOTH THESE VEHICLES PASS THEIR DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION INSPECTIONS, THE WHEELER GROUP DOES A PHENOMENAL JOB OF DOING MAINTENANCE ON THEM, OUR FIREFIGHTERS DO A GREAT JOB OF KEEPLING THEM UP, THEY'RE JUST TIRED VEHICLES AND THE CURRENT FLEET REPLACEMENT SCHEDULE DOESN'T SHOW THESE BEING REPLACED UNTIL FISCAL 27. I SHOULD BACK UP WITH OUR RESERVES.  BASICALLY ONCE A WEEK, ONE IF NOT BOTH OF THESE VEHICLES GOES INTO FRONTLINE SERVICE. ANY TIME ONE OF OUR NORMAL FRONTLINE RIGS GOES OUT FOR MAINTENANCE, THERE'S A MECHANICAL ISSUE WITH IT, AND ANY SORT OF ISSUE THESE VEHICLES GO TO THE FRONTLINES.  SO THEY'RE RESERVE, BUT SO LAST WEEK ONE OF THEM WAS IN SERVICE THE ENTIRE WEEK AND IT JUST KIND OF DEPENDS ON MAINTENANCE AND OTHER SORTS OF BREAKDOWNS. THESE RESERVES ENSURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE HAVE HAVE TO CLOSE STATIONS BECAUSE OF MECHANICAL ISH AS.  WE'RE NOT INCREASING THERE NUMBER OF VEHICLES, WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS JUST PULL AHEAD THE REPLACEMENT OF THESE TO FISCAL 23. SO WE WOULD PURCHASE MORE RIGS SOME OF OUR CURRENT FLEET WOULD MOVE TO RESERVE STATUS, AND IT WOULD JUST GIVE US A MORE RELIABLE RESERVE FLEET AND THE CONCERN IS THAT ONE OF THESE HAS A CATASTROPHIC BREAKDOWN WE COULD END -P HAVING TO THROW A LOT OF MONEY AT A VEHICLE THAT'S ALREADY AT END OF LIFE. SO, THIS IS A HORIZON ISSUE. AND AGAIN IT'S NOT ASKING FOR ANY REAL ADDITIONAL FUNDING, IT'S JUST PULLING THAT FUNDING AHEAD FROM THE CURRENT SCHEDULE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
00:51:21.459: >> THANK YOU, CHIEF KENNEDY.  SO COUNCIL, THE FIRE DEPARTMENT IS THE SECOND LARGEST DEPARTMENT FINANCIALLY IN THE GENERAL FUND THE LARGEST IS THE POLICE DEPARTMENT. JACKIE, IF YOU COULD BRING CHIEF THAT WOULD BE GREAT.
00:51:39.544: >> HE SHOULD ALREADY BE HERE.
00:51:41.579: >> THANK YOU.
00:51:49.153: >> GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE. SO, UH, AS FAR AS THE STRATEGIC PLAN SPACE WE WERE IN LINE WITH CERTAINLY TRYING TO KEEP A SAFE ENGAGED AND VIBRANT COMMUNITY BY HAVING OUR OBJECTIVE BE TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE FEELS SAFE WITHIN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD AND THE BROADER COMMUNITY IN GENERAL. WE MEASURE THAT BY SAFETY SURVEY HOPEFULLY GETTING 93% RESIDENT APPRECIATION AND APPROVAL RATING BY THE YEAR 2022.  NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. TWO BIGGEST IMPACTS THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY ASKING FOR ARE INVESTMENT IN COMMUNITY POLICING AND POTENTIALLY P A PILOT PROGRAM FOR A MENTAL HEALTH RESPONSE MODEL.  THE AMOUNTS ARE TO BE DETERMINED BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THERE'S AN INFLUENCE ON THE CERTAINLY THE RESIDENTS THAT WE HAVE TO GET REGARDING COMMUNITY POLICING.  THIS PAST YEAR REGARDING COVID REALLY IMPACTED OUR ABILITY TO GET OUT AND DO ALL THE THINGS THAT WE NEEDED TO DO TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE MINDFUL OF EVERYTHING THAT ALL THE NEIGHBORHOODS AS FAR AS WHAT THAW NEED AND HOW THEY WANT TO BE POLICED AND THE CERTAIN LOCATIONS. IT'S IMPACTED OUR ABILITY TO SAY AS WE TRANSITION OVER FROM THE OPEN MODEL THAT WE WERE DOING BEFORE TO MORE OF A COMMUNITY POLICING MODEL.  THAT'S YET TO BE DETERMINED BECAUSE WE ARE IMPACTED STILL BY COVID AND THE FACT FACT IS WE DON'T ACTUALLY GET TO TALK TO RESIDENTS IN PERSON LIKE WE DID. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. OUR COURT SERVICES - - OUR CORE SERVICES ARE FAIRLY SIMPLE. COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT WHICH IS ABOUT BUILDING TRUST WITH ALL OF THE RESIDENTS THAT LIVE IN THE COMMUNITY BY HAVING POSITIVE EXCHANGES AND INTERACTIONS WITH THEM TO FIND OUT WHAT IT IS THAT THEY LIKE AND PREFER AS FAR AS POLICING IS CONCERNED OR MORE IMPORTANTLY WHAT THEY NEED TO FEEL SAFE WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND HOW WE CAN COME TOGETHER ON SOME OF THOSE ISSUES. OBVIOUSLY ANOTHER SERVICE WE PROVIDE IS ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES AROUND VISIBILITY AND REALLY TRANSPARENCY WHETHER IT'S THROUGH OUR WEBSITE THAT WE'D LIKE TO IMPROVE OR SOCIAL MEDIA ISSUES AND THE ONE AREA THAT INCREASING ININ GENERAL WE REALLY STRUGGLE WITH IS TRANSPARENCY, TRANSPARENCY 33 DATA.  AND MAKING SURE THAT WE PUT OUT DATA APPROPRIATELY TO SHOW WHAT IT IS WE DO AND WHY WE DO IT, AND HOW WE DO IT, RATHER THAN SOMETHING - - . SOMETHING WE'RE LOOKING TO ENHANCE AND IMPROVE AS WELL. PATROL COMES IN TWO FLAVORS THE TRADITIONAL RESPONSE TO 9-1-1, YOU KNOW, WHERE YOU CALL AND WE GO FOR SERVICE.  THE OTHER PART OF IT PARTICULARLY ALL ROUND COMMUNITY POLICING IS REALLY VISIBILITY OF PATROL AND BEING THERE TO DETER CRIME IN GENERAL JUST BY VISIBILITY AND BEING AT THE RIGHT PLACE TO MAYBE DETER FOLKS FROM DOING BAD THINGS. YOU KNOW, THE LAST THING OF WHAT WE DO CAN POTENTIALLY BE IMPACTED IS OUR CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS WITH DETECTIVES AND THE SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE. OBVIOUSLY CRIMES ARE A BIG PART OF WHAT THEY DO, BUT THEY DO QUITE A BIT IN GENERAL TO HELP BUSINESSES AND RESIDENTS ACTUALLY NOT BE VICTIMS OF CRIME IN THE FIRST PLACE.  SO WE WOULD LOVE TO REDUCE CRIME, PARTICULARLY VIOLENT CRIME IN GENERAL GOING FORWARD.  NEXT SLIDE. THE IMPACT THAT IN GOING THROUGH THIS SLIDE REDUCTION EXERCISE SOME OF THE THINGS WE FOUND WE HAVE RETIREMENTS.  WE GET SIGNIFICANT SAVINGS WHEN PEOPLE RETIRE. ALMOST A THIRD OF OUR POLICE DEPARTMENT AND WITHIN THE NEXT THREE YEARS IT CAN ACTUALLY UM GO IN RETIREMENT. OVERALL THEY CAN ACTUALLY DO IT THAT IS A PRETTY BIG NUMBER. VERY DIFFICULT TO REPLACE THE IMPACT ON THAT COULD BE PRETTY SEVERE.  OVER TIME REDUCTION. THIS PAST YEAR IS REALLY NOT A GOOD EXAMPLE BECAUSE A LOT OF THE EVENTS WERE CANCELED, FOOTBALL WAS CANCELED. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS THE IDEA IS HOPEFULLY WE WON'T NEED TO DO ADDITIONAL OVERTIME AS A RESULT, BUT THAT COULD COME BACK TO BITE US IN SOME WAYS DEPENDING ON IF WE GO TOO LOW WE HAVE TO MAKE UP OVER TIME JUST FOR SICK TIME PURPOSES, OVER TIME IN GENERAL TO MAKE UP FOR SHORTAGES FOR THAT TO BE AN ISSUE IN THE FUTURE. SOME OF THE TRANSCRIPTION SERVICES THAT WE HAVE AND WE DID FIND A FAIR AMOUNT OF SAVINGS IN OUR FLEET ELIMINATION OF A COUPLE OF VEHICLES AND THE SAVINGS WE GET FROM THAT. OBVIOUSLY THE LARGEST PORTION OF THE FUNDS THAT WE NEED TO 5 PERCENT REDUCTION WOULD COME FROM PERSONNEL.  AND THAT WOULD BE AT LEAST 11 FULL-TIME OFFICERS IN THE AMOUNTS OF OVER A MILLION DOLLARS IN SAVICS BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN THAT WOULD OCCUR. NOW, OF COURSE THE IMPACT OF THAT COULD BE SEVERAL DEPENDING ON THE PRO OTHERS AT THE TIME OBVIOUSLY WITH INPUT FROM THE PUBLIC AND WHAT IS GOING ON WE WOULD PROBABLY REDUCE SOME OF THE SERVICES WE PROVIDE IN SPECIALIZED UNITS MAYBE A TRAFFIC UNIT BY ELIMINATING THAT AND MAYBE INCORPORATING THEM IN THE REST OF THE PATROL. THAT COULD POTENTIALLY IMPACT SOME OF THE TRAFFIC SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE - - THE AMOUNT OF IT IN TOTAL WE WOULD STILL OBVIOUSLY ENFORCE TRAFFIC AND DO THINGS AS FAR AS SPEEDING IS CONCERNED.  BUT WE COULDN'T DO IT IN THE SAME WAY. IT ALSO COULD IMPACT THE SPECIALIZEED UNITS OF AROUND TRAFFIC AND ACCIDENTS AND ACCIDENT RECONSTRUCTION AND THINGS OF THAT NICHER. WE WOULD MAYBE NO LGER BE ABLE TO PRODE THOSE SERVICES. ANOTHER POTENTIAL ELIMINATION THAT WE HAVE IS POLICE SERVICE SPECIALISTS, POSITION, THAT ACTUALLY IS A CIVILIAN-BASED INITIATIVE THAT TAKES POLICE REPORTS AND - - AT THE FRONT DESK.  BY ELIMINATING THAT WE COULD GET SOME SAVINGS. IRONICALLY ELIMINATING OF THAT PARTICULAR POSITION WOULD END UP MEANING THAT WE HE TOAKE ANOTHER OFFICER TO BRING IN AS LL TO DO THE SAME SERVICE. SO IT IS IS A LITE BIT SELF-DEFEANG BUT THAT IS WHAT WE WOU HAVE TO D DID WT TO P OUT AND SPEAK RY BRIEFLY TO THE SIZ OF T TY COMPARED T 2017 DATAHAT WE HAVE OF 5 O6 LARGEST CITIES CITIES SIMILAR SIZEO ANN ARRE ARE PROBABLYF NOT T LOST P CAPITA POLICE OFFICER IN THE REGION. IF WE'RE NOT THE LEAST, WE ARE PROBABLY SECOND TO LEAST AS FAR AS THE NUMBER OF OFFICER PER POPULATION AND THE POPULATION IN ANN ARBOR WAS GOING -P INTRODUCING THAT SHOULD BE SOMETHING TO CONSIDER PARTICULARLY AS WE GO FORWARD. ONE. GIVEN THE NATCH OF WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON PARTICULARLY WITH THE EVENTS IN THE CAPITAL AND THE REST OF THE GROUP OF CRIME THAT'S OUT THERE, WE WANTED TO ADD IN EXPLOSIVE DETECTING K-9 TO THE UNIT TO PROVIDE SOME SECURITY PARTICULARLY TO SOME OF THE FAITH-BASED GROUPS AND ALL THE SPECIAL EVENTS AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE IF THEY WERE TO COME BACK. CURRENTLY THERE'S A SHORTAGE OF THAT WITHIN THE COUNTY, IN GENERAL, AND WE DO HAVE CURRENTLY K9S THAT ARE DRUG-BASED BUT THE TREND IS GOING THE OPPOSITE AND THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS.  SO THAT WAS ONE OF THE REQUESTS THAT WE WANTED TO GO FORWARD AND THAT COST REALLY HAS TO DO WITH THE K9 AND THE VEHICLE THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO BE TRANSPORTED IN OR WITH. ANOTHER REQUEST WE PUT IN FOR ELECTRIC BICYCLES WHICH ARE WHAT THEY ARE.  IT'S CERTAINLY GOES TOWARDS COMMUNITY POLICING VISIBILITY AND MORE IMPORTANTLY IT'S VERY GOOD ON THE ENVIRONMENT. BUT THEY CAN ALSO STILL RESPOND TO CURRENT 9-1-1 CALLS AS WELL BECAUSE THE OFFICERS COULD STILL GET THERE RELATIVELY QUICKLY WITHOUT THE LOSS OF RESPONSE TIME.  WE HAVE A TASER REPLACEMENT WE PUT IN OUR TASERS AT THE END OF LIFE AND UNFORTUNATELY THEY DO NEED TO BE REPLACED BECAUSE THEY ARE DYING AND THEY ARE IN NEEDED. THE LAST THICK WE PUT THERE WAS ABOUT ANOTHER BUZZ APPOSITION WHICH IS A CHIEF STRATEGY ADDED TO CERTAINLY OUR COMMAND STAFF THE PURPOSES OF REALLY IMPLEMENTING COMMUNITY POLICING NOT FROM A STANDPOINT OF IMPLEMENTING BUT ON THE BACK. PART OF MY JOB IS TO BE OUT FRONT CERTAINLY TO BE OUT THERE AMONGST THE OFFICERS AND DOING SOME THINGS AROUND COMMUNITY POLICING. I'M ABLE TO DO THAT UNLESS THERE'S SOMEWHERE THERE WHO UNDERSTANDS AND IMPLEMENTS AND MAKING SURE WE'RE DOING QUALITY ASSURANCE AROUND MONITORING, EVALUATING, AND MAKING SURE OUR STRATEGY IS HAPPENING IN ALL THE PLACES WE NEEDED TO HAPPEN DEPARTMENT-WIDE AS WE CROSS OVER. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT PROBABLY INITIATE AND MENTION SOME A YEAR AGO WHEN WE FIRST STARTED STILL BRING IT BACK UP AGAIN JUST MAYBE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT TYPE. YOU CAN GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE. ALL THOSE TOGETHER ARE REALLY WOULD GET TO THE AMOUNT OF THE 5% AND THEN ADD A LITTLE BIT BACK TO IT. OUR HORIZON ISSUES AND I TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IT IS IN THE TADSER.  THEY NEED TO BE REPLACED AND THE GOOD THING ABOUT THE NEW ONES IS THEY COME WITH AUTOMATIC FEATURES THAT TIE INTO BODY CAMERA WHERE THEY TURN ON AUTOMATICALLY IF ANYBODY WOULD USE THEM. COMMUNITY POLICING. COST OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES IN GENERAL IS A COST THAT'S GOING UP THAT EVERYONE IN THE CITY WILL HAVE TO INTER THOSE. CIVIL UNREST.  THIS HAS BEEN A PRETTY HORRIFIC YEAR, SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS, BUT THE COMBINATION OF THE UNKNOWN OF JUST UNREST IN GENERAL AND COUPLE WITH THE FACT THAT THERE WILL BE CERTAINLY SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM AND WITH THE END DATES THAT ARE KNOWN AT THIS CURRENT TIME, AND THE COST ASSOCIATED WITH THEM. I JUST DON'T KNOW BUT I WOULD IMAGINE IT WOULD BE SEVERAL. THE ABILITY TO RECRUIT DURING THIS PERIOD IS A VERY DIFFICULT TIME IN GENERAL.  SO WHO KNOWS HOW THAT MAY IMPACT US BUT HOPE IT HASN'T SO FAR WHICH IS A VERY GOOD THING. OFFICER WELLNESS.  VERY, VERY IMPORTANT IN THE SENSE IT'S BEEN A TUMULTUOUS YEAR IN GENERAL BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AND WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING PROACTIVELY FOR THE MEN AND WOMEN TOON DO THE JOB JUST IN GENERAL TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE OKAY IN GENERAL.  I THINK IT PAYS DIVIDENDS IN GENERAL NOT JUST FOR OFFICERS BUT FOR EVERYONE IN GENERAL. SO, YOU ADD TO ALL THOSE UP AND THEN WE HAVE OUR EMERGING CRIME TRENDS WHERE THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY RIGHT NOW CRIME TRENDS ARE GOING WAY UP. VIOLENT CRIME IS SPIKED SIGNIFICANTLY THROUGHOUT OUR COUNTRY.  INCLUDING HERE IN ANN ARBOR.  SO AS FARES ASSAULTS ARE CONSERVE CONCERNED.  TRENDS ARE NAT GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BUT AGAIN HOPEFULLY AS WE GO THROUGH COVID THAT CHANGES. SO. NEXT SLIDE. AND THAT'S IT.  THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME.
01:05:17.027: >> MR. MR. CRAWFORD:  THANK YOU, CHIEF.  WE'RE GOING TO NOW MOVE TO THE COMMUNITY SERVICES AREA.
01:05:35.979: >> SHOULD BE JOINING US IN JUST A SECOND.
01:05:44.421: >> I THINK I'M HERE.  TAKES LONGER TO GO FROM BEING OUTSIDE THE ROOM AND UP TO HERE THAN IT DID TO WALK UP TO THE PODIUM IN THE OLD SETUP. NOTHING LIKE HAVING TO FOLLOW THE TWO GUYS IN UNIFORM. WE ARE COMMUNITY SERVICES I THINK EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO WE ARE.  FOR THE MOST PART WE DO EVERYTHING PARKS AND RECREATION, PLANNING AND ZONING, BUILDING AND RENTAL, OUR COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT INVOLVEMENT WORKS LEANS TOWARDS WORKING WITH THE COUNTY AND HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES ISSUES, AFFORDABLE HOUSING ISSUES, WE ALSO PARTNER EXTENSIVELY WITH THE ARCH ARBOR HOUSING COMMISSION ON THEIR PROJECTS AND TRY TO ASSIST THEM WHEREVER WE CAN. NEXT SLIDE. PARKS AND REC, OUR BIGGEST DEPARTMENT MONEY-WISE, SPREAD ABOUT 60-40 BETWEEN THE GENERAL FUND AND THE PARKS VILLAGE.  OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES IS ONE THAT PARKS HITS PRETTY MUCH EVERY YEAR AND THAT'S TO MAINTAIN HIGH QUALITY RECREATIONAL AND FITNESS OPPORTUNITIES AND THE 94% POSITIVE RATING THAT THEY SET THE BAR PRETTY HIGH, WHEN IT COMES TO THAT. I THINK THE BIGGER THING IS I THINK ALL OF YOU AT THIS POINT AT ONE TIME OR THE OTHER TALKED ABOUT IT, THAT'S THE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR CAPITAL ASSETS THAT GOES EVERYTHING FOR OUR PHYSICAL STRUCTURES, COBBLESTONE, EVERYTHING ELSE TO ALL THE PLAYGROUNDS, EVERYTHING ELSE. THAT GO TO MAKE UP 165 I BELIEVE PARKS, 64 PARKS, AND OVER 3,000 MAKERS AT THIS POINT.  MAKING SURE WE HAVE THE FUNDS NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN THAT CAPITAL INVESTMENT IS SUPER IMPORTANT TO US.  NEXT SLIDE. PARKS AND REC IMPACTS TO ACHIEVE STRATEGIC OBJECT.S.  WE REALLY ONLY HAVE ONE THAT HITS ON US, AND IT'S SOMETHING WE'VE WORKED TOWARDS A LOT.  IT'S A ONE-TIME COST THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT. WE'VE DONE A LOT OF INTERNAL WORK TO INVENTORY WHERE WE HAVE AS FAR AS CAPITAL ASSETS BUT AT SOME POINT WE NEED TO HAVE A DEFINED AND IMPLEMENTALABLE PLAN TO REPLACE THOSE ASSETS BEFORE THEY BECOME MORE EXPENSIVE TO MAINTAIN THAN THEY ARE TO REPLACE. WE DON'T HAVE THAT RIGHT NOW. 250,000-DOLLARS IS A LARGE PRICE TAG.  I DON'T EXPECT US TO HAVE TO SPEND THAT MUCH.  I'M HOPING WE DON'T. WE ARE SEEKING BETTER NUMBERS AND HOPEFULLY BY THE TIME THE BUDGET IS ACTUALLY CONSIDERED WE'LL HAVE A MORE WELL-ROUNDED OR WELL-THOUGHT THROUGH NUMBER. FOR NOW WE'RE PUTTING THIS HERE AS PLACEHOLDER BECAUSE WE'VE LACKED AT SIMILAR CITIES AND TALKED WITH SOME OF THIVE NEARING FIRMS THAT DO THESE TYPE OF ANALYSIS.  IF SIMILAR-TYPE CITIES THIS IS NOT THAT FAR OUT OF REACH. WHEN YOU IMPLEMENTATION. NEXT SLIDE. CORE SERVICE. I'M NOT GOING TO READ THROUGH ALL OF THESE.  BUT THESE PERFORMANCE MEASURES ARE ONES WE TRACK QUARTERLY. JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER DEPARTMENT IT'S AN EXAMPLE OF THEM WE TRACK MANY MORE.  THESE GO TO TOUCH ON SOME OF THE DIFFERENT SERVICES AREAS WE HAVE AND PROVIDE WITHIN PARKS AND RECREATION AND HOW WE TRACK WHETHER WE'RE DOING A GOOD JOB OR NOT.  AND THE CITY'S MONEY IS SPENT WELL OR NOT. NEXED SLIDE. THIS IS WHAT YOU'VE ALL BEEN SEEING TONIGHT.  I THINK YOU'RE AWARE OF THE 5% TASK.  THIS IS A COMBINATION, AND I'M NOT GOING TO GO THROUGH THEM ALL INDIVIDUALLY, OF FEE ADJUSTMENTS, AND THE ALLOCATION OF FUNDS BETWEEN FEE MINOR FEE INCREASES, MOVING OF STAFF TIME AND CROSS BETWEEN THE GENERAL FUND AND THE VILLAGE DEPENDING ON CONTINUAL REFINEMENT FROM OUR PARKS MANAGER ON HOW THEY DO THEIR BUSINESS. AND THEN THERE'S SOME INCREASES IN HERE AS WELL THAT ARE JUST DUE TO APPARITIONAL ISSUES. NEXT SLIDE. SAME THING HERE.  THESE ARE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY FEE INCREASES, THE AMOUNT O TO - - I DON'T THINK WE'VE INCREASED ANY OF THESE FEES SINCE PRE-2015. ALL OF THESE AMOUNT TO RATHER SMALL ADJUSTMENTS AND COST PERCENTAGE WISE THEY ARE VERY AVERAGE RIGHT AROUND 10%.  BUT THIS IS IN COMBINATION WITH MOVING MONEY AND REDUCING WHAT WE SPEND ON TREE PRUNING, HOW WE'RE PROPOSING TO GET TO RIGHT NOW THE I THINK IT'S ABOUT 460,000 IN CUTS IN THE GENERAL FUND TO MAKE THE 5%. THESE ARE ALL MOST OF THESE TRUTHFULLY ARE FEES WE WOULD PROBABLY COME BACK WITH A FEE SCHEDULE REGARDLESS BECAUSE IS TIME TO MAKE THOSE ADJUSTMENTS. WE DON'T ADJUST EVERY YEAR LIKE A LOT OF PLACES DO.  WE DON'T DO 2 PEST OR 2.5 PERCENT A YEAR. WE TEND TO DO IT EVERY FIVE TO TEN YEARS AND DO IT IN SLIGHTLY LARGER CHUNKS. ON AVERAGE, THESE AVERAGE OUT TO BELOW PROBABLY WHAT WOULD BE A MARKET ADJUSTMENT IF WE WERE TO DO IT YEAR BY YEAR. SO, UH, WE'RE NOT PROPOSING TO CUT STAFF IN PARKS AND REC AT THIS POINT, BUT THIS I A CONTINUALISM PACT ON OUR BUDGET WE'RE SQUEEZING THINGS TIGHTER AND TIGHTER. IT LESSENS OUR ABILITY TO DO MORE WITH THESE FUNDS AS THESE ADJUSTMENTS ARE MADE WHEN THEY'RE SUCKED UP BY THE NEED TO REDUCE OUR GENERAL FD EXPENDITURES. NE SLIDE. PARK HORIZON IUES.  COVID-19 HAS THWN GIANTONKEY WRENCH INTO PAR AND EVERYTHINGEO. STAFF.  O STAFF WAS IREDIBLY ADTABLE LAST YEAAND FLEXIBL OPERATIONSNDE'RE AE T STAY ON OR EAD OF THEURVE AS FAR ASHAT THE GOVERNOS OFFI DID AND IXPECT THEM TO DO THE SAME THISUMMER. WONDFUL CILITI BACKCAMPS AND ONLINE BUT THAS GOI T BE PROTOCOLS AND AS GUIDELINES DICTATE PROCESS AS WE GO INTO HERE. THE BIGGEST ONE, I CAN'T BEAT THIS DRUM HARD ENOUGH, IS AGING INFRASTRUCTURE.  A LOT OF THE PARKS FACILITIES, A LOT OF THE BILLINGS, A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT GO INTO MAKING EVERYTHING RUN WERE BUILT AROUND THE SAME TIME AND THEY'RE ALL CAN BECOMING 30, THUS PLUS YEARS OLD. SIMILAR TO INFRASTRUCTURE, SIMILAR TO WATER SEWER THERE'S A BUBBLE IN THE PARKS SYSTEM WHEN IT COMES TO CAPITAL. WE ME TO IDENTIFY WHAT THOSE NEEDS ARE AND START TO SET MONEY ASIDE AHEAD OF TIME SO WE'RE NOT CHASING OUR TAIL WHEN IT GETS TO THOSE. AND I THINK EVERYBODY IN PARKS IS SIMILAR. WANTS TO BE A LEADER IN DEI FOR THE DEPARTMENTAL LEVEL AND UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO TO AT THAT SCALE. NEXT SLIDE. BUILDING AND RENTAL, IF EVERYBODY REMEMBERS THE ORIENTATION IS SPLIT BETWEEN THE CONSTRUCTION FUND WHERE MOST OF THE BUILDING TRADE PERMIT AND INSPECTION UPRATION GOES. RENTAL HOUSING WHICH WE DO HAVE A SIZABLE RENTAL MARKET IN THE CITY OF ARCH ARBOR. SPECIFICALLY DUE TO THE UNIVERSITY. AND THEN A LOT OF OUR ADMINISTRATIVE THINGS STILL COME OUT OF THE JENAL FUND.  THE STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES ARE SOME OF OUR BETTER DEPARTMENTS TO MAINTAIN 90% OR HIGHER RATINGS FROM A SATISFACTION FROM RESIDENTS AND OTHERS WHO USE OUR SERVICES. NEXT SLIDE.  ARE. WE HAD NO REAL STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES THAT APPLIED DIRECTLY TO BUILD BUILDING AND RENTAL. JUST GO RIGHT ON THROUGH. CORE SERVICES. THESE ARE GENERAL CONSTRUCTION FUND MOST OF WHAT WE DO IN THE BILLING DEPARTMENT EVERYTHING DEPENDS HOW TAS WE CAN TURN A PERMIT AND GET OUT AND DO AN INSPECTION.  A LOT OF THESE ARE YOU CAN SEE OUR GOAL IS ALWAYS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE SOMEONE IF YOU WANT AN INSPECTION DONE IS TO BE ABLE TO SCHEDULE THAT AND HAVE THAT DONE WITHIN 24 TO 48 HOURS. WHAT WE FIND IF IT TAKES ANY LONGER THAN THAT, PEOPLE MOVE ON WITH THEIR PROJECTS.  THEY MAY TEND NOT TO SCHEDULE THE INSPECTION AND HOPE TO GET BACK BOO i WITH A PROJECT FURTHER DOWN THE LINE, AND THAT DECREASES THE SAFETY ACROSS THE CITY. PLUS IT DECREASES PEOPLE'S DESIRE TO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN THEIR PROPERTIES IF THEY'RE CONSTANTLY WAITING. AND RENTAL PROPERTIES IS A BIG ONE, FIRST-TIME PASS.  FOR US THAT'S A GREAT INDICATION THAT WHAT OUR EXPECTATIONS ARE ARE CLEAR TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND THAT OUR INSPECTORS KNOW WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR IN THE FIELD. WHEN WE COME OUT TO DO A RENTAL INSPECTION, PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW WHAT THEIR GROW YING TO SEE, BE ABLE TO ANTICIPATE THAT IN A CLEAR WAY, AND THEN THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE THOSE PROPERTIES PREPARED SO WE DON'T HAVE TO COME BACK OUT TWICE. THAT HELPS THEM AND THAT HELPS US.  THE MORE FIRSTS WE DO, I THINK IT'S BETTER FOR THE CITY. IF WE'RE GOING OUT TO JUST DOUBLE CHECK THE WORK'S BEEN DONE THAT DOESN'T SERVE A PURPOSE FOR ANYBODY. NEXT SLIDE. WE WERE ABLE TO ACHIEVE SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS OR GENERAL FUND COSTS, THIS IS WELL ABOVE THE BUILDING DEPARTMENT'S 5%.  WE TRIED TO DO THIS FROM A COMMUNITY SERVICE AREA OVERALL, THAT'S HOW THE BUDGET WORKS. THIS HELPS US TO NOT BE ABLE TO MAKE CUTS IN PLACES LIKE COORDINATED FUNDING, POTENTIALLY WHAT WE PARTNERED WITH IN THE COUNTY.  WE DID THAT AGGRESSIVELY TRACKED OVER THE LAST 5 YEARS WHERE OUR STAFF SPENDS THEIR TIME IN REAL ALLOCATIONS OPPOSED TO JUST ESTIMATES BETWEEN THE CONSTRUCTION FUND AND THE GENERAL FUND. SO WE ARE ABLE TO MAKE SOME CONTINUED TWEAKING TO THAT. ONE OF THE MORE DIFFICULT THINGS WE'VE DEALT WITH OVER THE LAST YEAR DOES HAVE SOME POSITIVE REPERCUSSION.  THERE WILL BE A REGISTRATION FEE ASSOCIATED WITH SHORT-TERM RENTAL, WE ANTICIPATE. THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARILY CONSERVATIVIST MATE.  THIS WOULD ESTIMATE AT ABOUT A THOUSAND UNITS AT A HUNDRED BUCKS A PIECE WOULD BE ABOUT A THOUSAND DOLLARS. THE BARRICADES REDUCTION IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE CITY'S GETTING OUT OF THE BARRICADE BUSINESS ALL TOGETHER AND ALLOWING SPECIAL EVENTS TO USE PRIVATE FIRMS TO DO THOSE BECAUSE IT WOULD BENEFIT BOTH SIDES. AND THEN THERE ARE SMALL ADDITIONAL ADMINISTRATION FEES. WE WON'T GET ANY OF THE MONEY FROM TICKETS THAT WE DEAL WITH AS FAR AS ZONING OR BUILDING AND WE SPEND QUITE A BIT OF TIME IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE SIDE SO WE'RE GOING TO ADD AN ADMINISTRATIVE FEE TO THOSE. NEXT SLIDE.  +. HORIZON ISSUES.  THERE IS NOTHING LARGER THAN WE ARE REPLACEING TRACK - - WE DO TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PERMITS AND INSPECTIONS AND PAYMENTS PER YEAR THROUGH THAT SOFTWARE.  NOT TO MENTION OTHER DEPARTMENTS USE IT FOR PLAN REVIEW, PLANNING USER, ENGINEERING USE IT.  THIS IS REALLY AN ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE.  IT IS INGRAINED THROUGHOUT THE ORGANIZATION.  WE ARE ABOUT TWO-THIRDS OF THE WAY THROUGH THE REPLACEMENT OF THAT WE EXPECT TO SEE SIGNIFICANT EFFICIENCIES AND IMPROVEMENTS IN CUSTOMER SERVICE FROM IT. THE SOFTWARE WE USE NOW HAS REALLY STOPPED BEING SERVICED TO UPGRADE FOR A FEW YEARS AS A PATCH WORK SYSTEM THAT WE'VE BAND AIDED TOGETHER TO STAY AFLOAT. WE EXPECT THIS TO BE HOPEFULLY TRANSFORMATIONAL BUT AS WE KNOW ANY SOFTWARE INSTALLATION HAS ITS ISSUES. AND THEN NEXT THE NEXT ONE IS REALLY PIGGY BACKED ON, IT SHOULD INCREASE OUR ABILITY TO DO WORK IN THE FIELD SIGNIFICANTLY. IT'S DESIGNED TO BE A WORK FLOW, DRIVEN PROCESS AS OPPOSED TO A HUGE STEP HAVING TO BE MANUALLY MANIPULATED.  SO WE'RE HOPING IT ALLOWS US TO AUTOMATE A TON OF OUR PROCESS. AND THEN SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN ON OUR PLATE FOR YEARS THAT'S PROBABLY BEEN ON THIS SLIDE FOR A COUPLE OF YEAR SAID IS TO GO TO A MORE UNIVERSALLY UNDERSTOOD PROPERTY MAINTENANCE CODE.  GOES BACK TO OUR FIRST TIME INSPECTION, UNDERSTANDING. RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A HOUSING CODE THAT WORKS DIFFERENTLY THAN ALMOST ANY OTHER CITIES.  MOST CITIES USE WHAT IS A NATIONAL AREA STATE ADOPTED I BONIFACE HIERS KIA OR INTERNATIONAL PROPERTY MAINTENANCE CODE. THAT'S UPDATED SOMEWHERE TO THE BUILDING CODE ON REGULAR CYCLES AT THE STATE LEVEL WITH ONLY MINOR ADJUSTMENTS NEEDING TO BE MADE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL.  IT WOULD NOT BE SUCH A ONE OFF. AND HOW WE PURSUE PROPERTY MAINTENANCE ISSUES. NEXED SLIDE. PLANNING, THE BIG OBJECTSIVE AND MEASURE IS THE LAND USE MASTER PLAN.  WE'VE STARTED DOWN THAT ROAD BEFORE, SIDETRACKED TOWARDS THE END OF THE CONTRACT PROCESS, AND THEN COVID HIT.  AND IT'S BEEN SET ASIDE SINCE. I THINK WE UNDERSTAND FROM EVERYBODY INVOLVED THAT THAT HAS TO BE BACK ON THE TABLE AT SOME LEVEL OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS. NEXED SLIDE. INSTEAD OF BITING IT OFF ALL AT ONE CHUNK TO START WITH, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT BECAME REALLY APPARENT IS WE TRIED TO WORK THROUGH A CONTRACT FOR MASTER LAND USE PLAN WAS REALLY DIFFICULT CONVERSATION THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE WAS HAVING SURROUNDING SINGLE FAMILY ZONING.  A LOT OF MISCONCEPTIONS, A LOT OF PREDETERMINATIONS OF WHAT THE CITY SHOULD OR SHOULDN'T DO WAS OR WAS NOT GOING TO DO WHEN IT CAME TO SINGLE FAMILY ZONING AND IN CONVERSATIONS INTERNALLY AND WHAT WE WATCH PLAY OUT LOCALLY AND IN THE CITY OF ANNEERER, WE THOUGHT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MAY HELP MOVE THE MASTER LAND USE PROCESS PLAN FORWARD WAS TO FIRST HAVE A, AND WE'RE CALLING IT A COMMUNITY CONVERSATION. WHAT DO YOU WANT TO CALL IT PRO ACT -F PUBLIC OUTREACH, COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT, WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT.  WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION, I THINK, TO SATISFY AND TAKE THE EDGE OUT OF EVERYBODY'S NERVES WHEN IT COMES TO HOW THE MASTER LAND USE PLAN WILL LOOK AT SINGLE FAMILY ZONING AS A LAND USE. I THINK THAT STARTS WITH SOME COMMON GROUND ON THE HISTORY OF SINGLE FAMILY ZONING, WHAT WE THINK IS STAFF REGARDING SINGLE FAMILY ZONING WHERE IT NEEDS TO GO, WE NEED TO HEAR FROM OUR BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS, WE NEED TO HEAR FROM NEIGHBORHOOD GROUPS, WE NEED TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY FEELS HEARD AND COMFORTABLE THAT THERE IS NO DESIRE TO DRASTICALLY ALTER EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS HERE IN THE CITY OF ARCH ARBOR THROUGH THE MASTER LAND USE PLAN.  WE ARE CONCERNED THAT WILL BE AN IMPEDIMENT TO US GETTING OFF TO AN HONEST DISCUSSION ON THE MASTER PLAN. WE ARE PROPOSING, AND I THINK THIS IS THE FIRST TIME A LOT OF FOLKS HAVE HEARD IT, IS TO ACTUALLY PARTNER WITH PROFESSIONAL SERVICES MONEY ASIDE TO HAVE THAT COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT ON SINGLE FAMILY ZONING AND MAYBE SOME OTHER MASTER LAND USE PLAN ISSUES BEFORE WE ACTUALLY START DOWN THAT ROAD TO DO THE MASTER PLAN BECAUSE WE FEEL WHAT COMES OUT OF THAT WILL BE GOOD INFORMATION FOR WHOEVER AND HOWEVER WE DO THAT PLAN. THAT WAS A VERY LONG EXPLANATION OF A ONE-LINE COST. CORE SERVICES.  I THINK MOST OF YOU HAVE SEEN THESE BEFORE, BUT THESE ARE SIMILAR TO THE OTHER DEPARTMENTS.  THESE ARE PERFORMANCE MEASURES THAT WE TRACK ON A REGULAR BASIS. NEXT SLIDE. IMPACTS. AGAIN THIS IS A REPRESENTATIVE WE TRY TO KEEP IMPACTS OR CUTS WE TRY TO KEEP THEM ON THE REOCCURRING SIDE.  I'M NOT GOING TO GO THROUGH EACH ONE BUT THE BIG ONE HERE IS WE HAVE THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT IS ALMOST ALL STAFF TO PREVIOUS CUTS WE'VE TRIMMED IT DOWN TO ALMOST JUST STAFF AND NOTHING ELSE.  THERE'S BEEN NO MONEY FOR A LOT OF DIFFERENT PROJECTS.  WE ARE PROPOSING A RESTRUCTURE STARTING THIS YEAR WE HAVE 5 PLANNERS WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS JUST SOME PROCESS REALLOCATION TO THOSE POSITIONS, GOING TO TWO ASSOCIATE PLANNER POSITIONS AND THREE PLANNER POSITIONS, THESE WOULD BE SLIGHTLY - - LEVEL POSITIONS WHAT WE DIDN'T WANT TO DO WAS JUST DROP AN FTE TO MAKE THAT CUT.  WHAT THIS ALSO DOES FOR US IS WE ARE VERY HEAVY IN THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT AND SIMILAR TO WHAT OTHERS TALK ABOUT IS WE ARE ALMOST SPECIFICALLY PROJECT FOCUSED CH ARE ALMOST ALWAYS REACTIONARY, WE ALMOST ALWAYS SPEND ALL OF OUR TIME REVIEWING PROJECTS, WRITING STAFF REPORTS, AND SND VERY LITTLE TIME PROACTIVELY REEVALUATING THE PLANS AND THE CORE DOCUMENTS ON WHAT WE DO.  NOTUST THE MTER BLANCH, BUT EVEN OUR ORDANCE AN OTHER THINGS.  THIS WOULD ALLOW SOME REDISTRIBUTIONF H WE DO BLANCHING.  IT M HAVE IMPT O THE PROCT REVIE AND  HAVE LAS RESOURC AILABLE FOR THAT A WE MAY BE MOVING MOREESOURCES TO OTHER THIN. WE HOPE THE MOVING ALLF OUR SITEPLAN REVIEW AND COMMEING IS GOI TO IREASE CAPACY R US.  WHEN I. WE CANO LONGER SQUEEZE THOSE CUTS JUST OUT OF PAPER AND TRAVEL AND OTHER THINGS. SO THIS IS AN ATTEMPT AT US CONTINUING TO TRY TO PROVIDE HIGH LEVEL OF SERVICE, REFOCUS SERVICE, BUT WITHOUT A STRAIGHT REDUCTION IN FTES. THEN THE OTHER ONES ARE JUST THE REAL OCCASION OF RESOURCES IN PROFESSIONAL SERVICES TO ALLOW SOME FLEXIBILITY FOR PROJECTS EVERY YEAR WE'VE GONE BACK AND LOOKED COUNCIL HAS WANTED -S TO PARTNER TO DO SOME KIND OF SPECIAL PROJECT THAT'S REQUIRED OUTSIDE RESOURCES.  INSTEAD OF PLANNING AND TRYING TO BUDGET THOSE EVERY TIME THEY COME UP, IT'S OUR IDEA TO PUT SOME MONEY IN PROFESSIONAL SERVICES TO ALLOW THAT TO HAVE TO HAPPEN AS THOSE PROJECTS COME UP. THOSE LINE ITEMS EVERY YEAR. NEXT SLIDE. HORIZON ISSUES, MASTER PLAN FOR SURE.  YOU'LL SEE WE TALK ABOUT THIS ZONING LAND USE AND RACIAL EQUITY.  I THINK THAT GOES TO A LITTLE ABOUT -F THE CONVERSATIONS WE WANT TO HAVE. SOME HAVE BEEN OUT IN THE COMMUNITY FOR A LONG TIME AND I THINK IT'S WE BELIEVE IT'S PROBABLY FOR TO ENGAGE IN THOSE. IT'S PROBABLY TIME WE GET INVOLVED WITH THE COMMUNITY AND PARTICIPATE IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS, IF NOT LEAD SOME OF THEM. THEN AFFORDABILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY I THINK WE KNOW THOSE TWO ISSUES.  RIGHT - - RIGHTFULLY SO, ARE DRIVING A LOT, IF NOT THE PRIMARY ISSUES DRIVING ALMOST EVERYTHING WE DO RIGHT NOW.  OR AT LEAST THE UMBRELLA IN WHICH WE LOOK AT THEM. AND THEN RESTRUCTURING WE JUST TALKED ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT WHEN LOOKING AT THE LINE ITEMS. NEXT SLIDE. COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. THIS IS ONE THAT FEEDS INTO THE DEI STUFF.  WE KNOW WE ARE A SEGREGATED COMMUNITY, WE ARE A SEGREGATED COUNTY.  THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH MAYBE THE COUNTY AND SOME OUTSIDE AGENCIES OF EXACTLY HOW AND WHAT WE CAN DO TO INCREASE THE DIVERSITY. AND ANN ARBOR TO START, BUT IN THE REGION AS A WHOLE. NEXT SLIDE? AND THEN AGAIN THIS IS WE DON'T HAVE ANY FORMAL COSTING FOR THAT BUT WHAT WE DO KNOW IS I WOULD BE STUNNED IF IT DIDN'T REQUIRE SOME OUTSIDE EXPERTISE THAT WE DON'T HAVE ON STAFF TO DEVELOP THAT PLAN. I DON'T KNOW THAT YET, THIS IS AT ITS INFANCY. BUT WE THOUGHT IT WAS GOOD TO PUT A DOLLAR AMOUNT ASSOCIATED WITH IT BECAUSE LIKE ANYTHING ELSE TO MEET A STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE RARE LE IS THERE NOT A COST INVOLVED.  TO SAY WITH THE ADDITIONAL SLIDES OR WITH THE PREVIOUS SLIDES YOU'VE JUST SEEN, WE'RE REDUCING CAPACITY INTERNALLY TO TAKE OUT ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITY WITH STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES WHILE REDUCING INTERNAL CAPACITY, SOMETHING HAS TO GIVE AT SOME POINT. FOR US THAT MEANS THIS IS WHY WE ARE TALKING ABOUT USING OUTSIDE PROFESSIONAL SERVICES. THEY ALLOW US THE ONE TIME INCREASE IN CAPACITY OF PRODUCT BASE WITHOUT HAVING TO MAINTAIN THE ONGOING CAPACITY TO TAKE THESE ALL ON.  THAT'S WHAT THIS WOULD BE. AND THEN COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT A LOT OF THAT IS OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH THE COUNTY COORDINATED FUNDING.  I THINK EVERYBODY'S AWARE THAT COORDINATED FUNDING HAS AND IS CHANGING.  IT IS EVOLVING.  WE THINK THAT'S GOOD THING.  AND WE ARE GOING TO BE HAVING I THINK WHAT WOULD AMOUNT TO VERY SIGNIFICANT CONVERSATIONS STARTING IN THE SPRING HERE ABOUT WHAT COORDINATING FUNDING OR WHATEVER IT'S GOING TO BE CALLED IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE GOING FORWARD.
01:28:06.128: >> THANK YOU. NEXT, COUNCIL, WE HAVE CHERYL AND JUDGE - - AVAILABLE TO TALK ABOUT 15TH DISTRICT COURT.
01:28:26.548: >> SHOULD BE JOINING US MOMENTARILY. HAD HAD [NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE]
01:29:43.459: >> PROMOTE THEM BOTH TO PANELISTS.
01:29:45.694: >> I'M NOT ABLE TO ASSIST WAS OF MY SCREEN SHARING.  ROY THE MUTED? TRUST.
01:30:18.894: >> I'VE ASKED CHERYL TO UNMUTE HERSELF.
01:30:24.132: >> SORRY, WHERE DID WE LEAVE OFF?
01:30:25.667: >> THERE YOU GO.
01:30:29.238: >> CHERYL:  DID YOU HEAR ANY OF THE SERVICE - - .
01:30:32.007: >> WE DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING ACTUALLY.  IF YOU COULD START FROM THE TOP WE - - .
01:30:37.779: >> CHERYL:  OKAY. THAT'S TERRIBLE. ALL RIGHT, WELL GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE. THE COURT IS IN PLACE TO PROVIDE THE COMMUNITY WITH AN IMPARTIAL SAFE AND ACCESSIBLE FORUM FOR THE JUST RESOLUTION OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE DISPUTES.  WE HAVE FOUR SERVICE AREAS.  WE HAVE ADMINISTRATION WHICH IS RESPONSIBILITYABLE FOR A OVERSIGHT OF NON-JUDICIAL FUNCTIONS OF THE COURT.  SOME OF THINGS WE DO ARE PERSONNEL, BUDGET OVERSIGHT, GRANT OVERSIGHT, PURCHASING, RESPONDING TO REQUEST, HANDLING REQUEST FOR FOREIGN LANGUAGE INTERPRETERS, AND FACILITATING ADA ACCOMMODATIONS. THE SECOND AREA IS COMPRISED OF THE JUDGES AND THEIR DIRECT SUPPORT STAFF.  THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR CREATING THE OFFICIAL RECORD OF COURT PROCEEDINGS, MAINTAINING DECORUM IN THE COURTROOM, AND RESOLVING CASES IN A TIMELY MANNER WHALE WHO IL ENSURING RULE OF LAW AND PROTECTION OF THE INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS. THE THIRD AREA IS CASE PROCESSING, THIS IS OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE HUB. THAT'S WHERE THE CLERICAL STAFF RESIDE. THEY PERFORM ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS SUCH AS THE CREATION, MAINTENANCE, AND DESTRUCTION OF COURT FILES, SCHEDULING COURT HEARINGS, AND ACCEPTING PAYMENTS. AND LAST BUT NOT LAST THE PROBATION DEPARTMENT WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PRE-SENTENCE INVESTIGATIONS AND REPORTS SUPERVISING AND COUNSELING CLIENTS TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH COURT ORDERS AND REFERRALS TO OUTSIDE AGENCIES FOR SERVICES. NEXT SLIDE, PLEASE. SOME OF OUR, UM, PERFORMANCE MEASURES INCLUDE WE WANT TO ATTAIN A HUNDRED% COMPLIANCE WITH THE STATE COURT ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. FOR CASE PROCESSING WE WANT 97% OR GREATER ACCURACY IN PAYMENT PROCESSING.  FOR THE JUDGES WE CHOSE EACH YEAR WE HAVE AN ANNUAL PUBLIC SATISFACTION SURVEY AND OF COURSE EACH YEAR EXCEPT FOR 2020 DUE TO COVID WITHIN THAT SURVEY QUESTION NUMBER THREE IS THE WAY THE CASE WAS HANDLED, WHAT'S FAIR.  SO WHEN WE SAY THIS WE WANT PEOPLE TO FEEL THAT THEY HAD A FAIR HEAR HEARING OUR GOAL IS TO HAVE RESPONDENTS AGREE WITH THIS STATEMENT AT A HIGHER RATE THAN OR A HIGHER RATE OR AN EQUAL RATE TO THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE. WE WANT FOR PROBATION WE HAVE TWO MEASURES LISTED GREATER THAN 75% OF PROBATION CLIENTS SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETING PROBATION, AND WE ALSO WANT OUR SOBRIETY OUR GRADUATES RECIDIVISM RATES FOR ANY CONVICTION TO BE LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO THE STATEWIDE RATE FOR SOBRIETY COURT GRADUATES. NEXT SLIDE. THANK YOU. WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR ANY ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. AS FAR AS EXPENDITURES THE LARGEST EXPENDITURES IN THE COURT'S BUDGET ARE RELATED TO PERSONNEL AND IT.  POTENTIAL IMPACTS THAT COULD OCCUR TO ACHIEVE A 5% REDUCTION IN THE COURT'S EXPENSE BUDGET WOULD CERTAINLY IMPACT PERSONNEL. SO LOOKING AT THE SLIDE, WE HAVE POTENTIAL ELIMINATION OF BUDGETED EQUIPMENT ALLOWANCE.  WE HAVE A REDUCTION IN CONFERENCE TRAINING AND TRAVEL. THE NEXT ONE REDUCTION IN CONTRACTED SERVICES WITH COUNTY.  THIS ONE I WANT TO GIVE A LITTLE MORE INFORMATION ON. THIS WOULD ACTUALLY REQUIRE A REDUCTION IN OUR PUBLIC SERVICE HOURS.  PROPOSING EIGHT HOURS PER WEEK, WE WOULD HAVE STAFF HERE.  THE SAVINGS WOULD BE GAINED BY NOT HAVING THE WEAPONS SCREENING OFFICERS IN THE LOBBY PERFORMING THEIR DUTIES. THIS SOLUTION WAS CHOSEN OVER FURLOUGH DATES AS THE COURT RECEIVESS A LARGE NUMBER OF CIVIL NO FAULT CASE FILINGS AND A REDUCTION IN STAFF HOURS WOULD RESULT IN THE INCREASE IN THE CASE ENTRY BACK LOG. CURRENTLY, WE'RE ABOUT TWO WEEKS BEHIND IN THE CIVIL CASE ENTRY BECAUSE STAFF HAS BEEN WORKING MORE OVERTIME. BUT AVERAGE, THOUGH, THIS CAN BE UP TO SIX WEEKS. SO REGARDING THIS PROPOSED IDEA.  THE REDUCTION OF OR PUBLIC SERVICE HOURS WOULD HAVE TO BE PROVED BY THE STATE COURT ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE FOR US TO MOVE FORWARD WITH IT. THE NEXT ITEM, MAINTAIN FTE VACANCY FOR THREE MONTHS IN FISCAL YEAR 22. THIS IS THIS WOULD BE IMPACTFUL AS THIS IS PART OF SUCCESSION PLANNING FOR MY POSITION.  OF COURSE DELAYING KILL FILLING THIS POSITION REDUCES THE MOUNT OF TIME SOMEONE WOULD HAVE AVAILABLE TO THE TO LEARN THE ASPECTS OF WHAT I DO. THE NEXT ITEM IS REDUCTION POTENTIAL REDUCTION OF BAILIFFS WORK HOURS BY 5 HOURS PER WEEK. THESE WOULD BE HOURS THEY ARE NOT IN THE COURTROO  IT WOULD B SOMEWH IMPACTFUL T HELP WITH THE CLERICAL WORKHEN THEY A NOT THE COURTROOM HAVE A POTENTIAL DUCTION IN TEMPORARY WE MAY END UP MAKINUP FOR THAT LATER IN OR TIME THE NTTEM REDUCE POTTIAL SERVES. TH ONE IS RELATED T E MIDC WHICH IS THE COISSION  SO LOCLYEN WE RECEID REIMBURSEMENTS FOR SOME OF THEOSTS RELATEDDED TO INDIGENT DEFENSE THROUGH MIDC GRANTS. AND SO WE ARE REQUIRED TO MEET A LOCAL AMOUNT THAT IS IN THE COURT'S BUDGET. AMOUNTS ABOVE THE LOCAL SHARE ARE BEING REDUCED IN THE PROFESSIONAL SERVICES LINE SO THE ONLY THING I WOULD SAY IS THE MIDC GRANT FUNDS ARE NOT PROVED OR THEY BECOME UNAVAILABLE IN THE FUTURE THE COURT WOULD REQUEST AT THAT TIME ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR INDIGENT DEFENSE AS THE COURT'S REQUIRED BY LAW TO PROVIDE LEGAL COUNCIL FOR INDIGENT DEFENDANTS WHEN SANCTIONS UPON CONVICTION INCLUDE INCARCERATION. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE.  R. ACTUALLY, TOM, CAN YOU MOVE BACK, I THINK I MIGHT HAVE GOT A LITTLE TOO QUICKLY THERE. OH, I DID. UM, I'M SORRY REDUCTION IN MATERIALS AND SUPPLIES 2,000-DOLLARS, REDUCTION OF OVERTIME ALSO 2,000-DOLLAR. AND THE POTENTIAL ELIMINATION OF A POSITION AND THE ASSOCIATED COSTS. SO 109,000 ESSENTIALLY. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. HORIZON ISSUES. ALL RIGHT, SO THE FIRST ONE IS CHANGES IN MICHIGAN INDIGENT DENSE IF STANDARDS SO STANDARDS ONE THROUGH FOUR WERE APPROVED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF LICENSING AND REGULATORY AFFAIRS IN MAY OF 2017. THESE STANDARDS COVERED TRAINING AND EDUCATION OF COUNCIL, THE INITIAL CLIENT INTERVIEW, USE OF INVESTIGATORS AND EXPERTS AND OTHER CRITICAL STAGES. STANDARD 5, WHICH REQUIRES INDEPENDENCE FROM THE JUDICIARY WAS JUST APPROVED IN OCTOBER OF 2020.  THERE ARE ADDITIONAL STANDARDS OUT THERE THAT ARE PENDING APPROVAL.  THEY INCLUDE WORK LOAD LIMITATIONS, QUALIFICATION AND REVIEW OF ATTORNEYS ACCEPTING CLAIMANTS IN ADULT CRIMINAL CASES, ATTORNEY COMPENSATION, AND A STANDARD FOR DETERMINING INDIGENT AND CONTRIBUTIONS. THE SECOND ITEM, TRIAL COURT FUNDING.  THE TRIAL COURT FUNDING COMMISSION WAS CREATED TO REVIEW MICHIGAN'S TRIAL COURT FUNDING SYSTEM.  AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE ITS EFFECTIVENESS INCLUDING ANY CHANGES TO THE METHODS BY WHICH COURTS IMPOSE AND ALLOCATE FUNDS AND COFFERSES. THE COMMISSION'S RECOMMENDATIONS WERE PUBLISHED IN THE TRIAL COURT FUNDING COMMITTEE REPORT DATED 9/6 OF 2019. THE STRONGIST SUPPORT WAS FROM STAKEHOLDERS WHO WANTED PARTIALLY UNIFIED SYSTEM.  WHEREIN THE STATE AND THE STATE COURT ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE WOULD PROVIDE SERVICES, E-FILING DOCUMENT MANAGING, I'M SORRY DOCUMENT MANAGEMENT AND TECHNOLOGY WHILE THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES WOULD RETAIN OPERATIONAL CONTROL. THERE WAS NO UPDATA VEILABLE FROM THE STATE COURT ADMINISTRATIVE ON - - MY GOODNESS, I GOTTA SLOW DOWN. THERE WAS NO UPDATA VEILABLE FROM THE STATE COURT ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE ON THIS INITIATIVE. THE INFORMATION RECEIVED FROM OUR REGIONAL ADMINISTRATOR WAS THAT THEY BELIEVE THIS HAD STALL THROUGH THE MOMENT DUE TO COVID BUT WE'LL HEAR MORE ABOUT IT IN THE NEAR FUTURE. ALL RIGHT. THE NEXT ITEM, E-FILING, THIS ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE ALSO HAS AN INITIATIVE TO HELP COURTS USE TECHNOLOGY TO INCREASE EFFICIENCY AND IMPROVE ACCESS TO OUR ROLLOUT OF A STATEWIDE E-FILING AND ELECTRONIC DOCUMENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. WHEN THIS INITIATIVE BEGAN, COURTS WERE ASSIGNED TO WAVES. PREVIOUSLY WE WERE ASSIGNED TO WAVE 6, WHICH NEAR THE END. HOWEVER, THE STATE COURT ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE RECENTLY ASKED COURTS TO COMPLETE A SURVEY TO HELP REPRIORITIZE COURTS WHO ARE AWAITING IMPLEMENTATION. THIS REPRIORITIZATION MAY RESORT IN OUR COURT IN THE STATEWIDE SYSTEM SOONER WHICH WILL BE SUPER HELPFUL WITH OUR CIVIL CASE LOAD AND ALSO HELPFUL IN THE COVID TIMES. ALL RIGHT. THE LAST ONE, IMPACTS OF THE MICHIGAN CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM LEGISLATION. THERE WERE SEVERAL BILLS PUT FORTH THAT WERE ENACTED.  THE LEGISLATIVE CHANGES BECOME EFFECTIVE ON MULTIPLE DATES IN 2021. THE IMPACTS O THAT THESE NEW LAWS WILL HAVE IN THE COURT CASE LOADED BUDGET WILL BE HARD TO DETERMINE.  THE STATE COURT ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE IS WORKING TO PROVIDE US WITH ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATIONS AND DIRECTIVES RELATED TO THESE CHANGES AND MAYBE ONCE WE'VE RECEIVED THIS INFORMATION WE'LL BE ABLE TO QUANTIFY THE IMPACTS A LITTLE BETTER BUT AT THIS TIME I WOULD JUST SAY THEY'RE INDETERMINATE. A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES OF THE CHANGES ARE RECLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN TRAFFIC OFFENSES TO CIVIL INFRACTIONS. A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE WOULD BE DRIVING WHILE LICENSE IS SUSPENDED.  POTENTIAL POSITIVES WOULD BE CIVIL INFRACTIONS TYPICALLY TAKE LESS TIME FOR STAFF TO PROCESS AND TIME TO RESOLUTION FOR CIVIL INFRACTIONS IS GENERALLY SHORTER THAN IT IS FOR MISDEMEANORS. A POTENTIAL NEGATIVE IF YOU'RE TALKING BUDGET IS THAT THE ALLOWABLE - - FOR CIVIL INFRACTIONS ARE GENERALLY LOWER THAN THOSE ALLOWED ON SIMILAR CASES. A SECOND EXAMPLE IS SAYING JUSTICE REFORM LEGISLATION IS THE CLEAN SLATE BUILD WHICH ARE SCHEDULED TO GO INTO EFFECT IN APRIL.  THESE IMPACT THE RULES AND PROCEDURES IN INDIVIDUAL NEEDS TO HAVE PRIOR CONVICTION SET ASIDE. CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE EXISTING PAPER APPLICATION AND THE ELIGIBLE OFFENSES, AND THE BILL IS ALSO CREATING NEW AUTOMA MATIC PROCESS WHERE THOSE STATS ARE ELIGIBLE TO HAVE THEM SET ASIDE WITHOUT AN - - .
01:42:34.362: >> THANK YOU. UNLESS YOU HAVE ANYTHING ELSE, I THINK WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO OFFICE OF SUSTAINABILITY.
01:42:42.203: >> ALL SET, THANK YOU.
01:42:44.839: >> NOW WE HAVE DR. STOLTS HERE FOR THIS IS OUR LAST DEPARTMENT FOR THE EVENING.  WE'RE RUNNING A LITTLE BIT LONG BUT I HAVE ASKED DOCTOR TO COVER HER MATERIAL APPROPRIATELY.
01:43:01.789: >> DR. STOLTS:  THANK YOU, ADMINISTRATOR CRAWFORD, MAYOR, AND COUNCIL MEMBERS.  I HAVE THE DUBIOUS HONOR OF BEING THE CABOOE TONIGHT THANK YOU ALLER FOR FOR YOUR GREAT PATIENCE AS WE WORK THROUGH THIS TOPIC.  I AM GOING TO TRY TO BE SUCCINCT FOR YOU. AS MY COLLEAGUES HAVE DONE PREVIOUSLY IN TERMS OF THE STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES OSI HOLDS 11 OF THEM AND THEY RANGE, I WON'T READ THEM HERE, THEY RANGE FROM EVERYTHING FROM OUR DIVERSITY WORK ESPECIALLY OUR EQUITY AND DIVERSITY WORK OUT IN THE COMMUNITY, AND OF COURSE OBJECTIVES RELATED TO A20 WHETHER THAT'S CLEAN ENERGY AND THE ABSOLUTE GOAL OF REDUCING GREEN HOUSE GAS EMISSIONS.  ON THE LAST SLIDE YOU SEE OUR METRICS AROUND RESILIENCE AND CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE, OTHER ELEMENTS OF A20, AND EXCITINGLY OUR NEW 10,000 TREE INITIATIVE IS HERE AS WELL. THE NEXT SLIDE ROUNDS OUT THOSE 11 METRICS. THERE'S MORE HERE AROUND THE DISCLOSURE AND THE INFORMATION THAT WE'RE GENERATING IN TERMS OF HOW OUR INFRASTRUCTURE IS PERFORMING.  THE SECOND IS ABOUT HOW WE MOVE AROUND IN OUR COMMUNITY, MAKING SURE IT'S EASIER TO WALK AND BIKE, AND GENERALLY BE OUT ON THE STREET INTERACTING WITH PEOPLE IN A MORE KIND OF HUME: CENTRIC DESIGN. AND THEN BELOW YOU CAN THING - - SEE THINGS AROUND TRANSIT IN AND OUT OF THE COMMUNITY AS WELL AS HELPING OUR INDUSTRY INVEST MORE IN THE GREEN JOBS, THE SUSTAINABLE JOBS THAT WE WANT TO BE AN INNOVATOR AND RECEIVE TO HELP PROMOTE AND PUSH OUT TO THE MARKET. THESE ARE SOME OF THE STRATEGIC PLANS.  WHAT'S DIFFERENT HERE IS WITH A20 WE HAVE AN APP.  THE WAY WE STARTED OUR BUDGET WAS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT EACH STARTED FROM THE INVESTMENT SCENARIO THAT WAS PRESENTED WITH A20, AND WE MOVED BACKWARDS.  SO WE LOOKED AT THAT INVESTMENT SCENARIO AND WE STARTED TO ALSO MAKE CUTS ACROSS THE BOARD AND SAY WHAT CAN WE, WHAT CAN WE SACRIFICE IN THE NEXT YEAR OR TWO AND STILL ACHIEVE THE GROLL OF 2030. IT MAY MEAN WE HAVE TO BACK IN AND HAVE TO INVEST IN LATER YEARS BUT WE STILL HAD A CHANCE OF REACHING THAT OBJECTIVE. WHAT YOU SEE HERE, FOR THE STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE -F A20, IS REALLY A BUDGET INCREASE.  SO COUNT OF HIGHLIGHTING SOME OF THE LARGER ITEMS HERE TO FLAG THEM, WE ARE LOOKING AT BRINGING MORE STAFF ON GETTING UP TO THAT STAFFING LEVEL, AND I WANT TO POINT OUT ONE OF THE STAFF IN HERE IS ACTUALLY IN PARTNERSHIP WITH FACILITIES.  YOU HEARD MY COLLEAGUES TALK A LOT ABOUT CAPITAL INFRASTRUCTURE.  ONE OF THINGS THE WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT AS WE LOOK ACROSS THE ORGANIZATION IF WE'RE NOT INVESTING IN PROACTIVELY MAINTAINING OUR INFRASTRUCTURE, WE'RE PUTTING A LOT OF SUSTAINABILITY FEATURES, A LOT OF REALLY GOOD HIGH-QUALITY COMFORT AND SAFETY FEATURES IN OUR BUILDINGS, WHICH ARE CRITICAL, BUT WE'RE NOT PROACTIVELY MAINTAINING IS THE EMBOSS WE DON'T HAVE THE STAFF TO DO THAT.  IF WE DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO REPLACE THEM, IT'S MORE CRITICAL THAT WE HAVE THE STAFF CAPACITY TO MAINTAIN THEM AND TO OPERATE THEM.  AND GET AS MUCH USEFUL LIFE OUT OF THEM. THAT'S THE PROPOSAL HERE. AS WELL AS THESE LEVERAGE TEMPORARY STAFF IN OSI TO GET PROGRAMS UPAND RUNNING.  THERE'S A THREAT THAT WE'LL LOSE A LOT OF THOSE THAT INSTITUTIONAL KNOWLEDGE WHEN THOSE PEOPLE LEAVE WAS WE CAN'T MOVE THEM INTO FULL-TIME ROLES. THE PROPOSAL HERE IS TO TAKE THE STAFF THAT HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH US, BUILDING THE PROGRAMS, DEMONSTRATED A REALLY HIGH PERFORMANCE LEVEL AND WELD THEM INTO THE TEAM. WE ALSO ARE ASKING FOR A BRIDGE AND FUNDING UNTIL WE GET OUR VEHICLE REPLACEMENT RATE UPDATED TO REFLECT THE HIGHER UP-FRONT COFFERSES OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES SPECIFICALLY FOR HEAVY EQUIPMENT.  WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH PUBLIC WORKS TO IDENTIFY VEHICLES THAT ARE UP FOR REPLACEMENT, PRIME AURAL THINGS LIKE REFUSE TRUCKS WHICH WOULD BE VERY EXCITING.  THERE IS A DEALT ATHERE.  SO WE'RE PROPOSING JUST COVERING THE DELTA UNTIL THOSE REPLACEMENTS ARE FULLY INSTITUTIONALIZE. THE BIG TICKET ITEM IS THE ONE THAT VERY BOTTOM AND THIS IS FUNDAMENTALLY ABOUT MAKING THE PHYSICAL IMPROVEMENTS IN OR COMMUNITY WHETHER THAT IS THROUGH THE INSTALLATION OF PUBLIC EV CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE, WHICH IN FACT IS THE BIG TICKET ITEM HERE.  THERE ALSO IS INVESTMENT IN THE CITY FACILITIES TO DO THE EFFICIENCY UPGRADES THAT ARE DESPERATELY NECESSARY.  WE JUST COMPLETED AUDITS ON A NUMBER OF FACILITIES SO WE HAVE A LIST OF PROPOSED EVENTS. AND THEN THE ELECTIONFICATION.  AS WE'RE TAKING OUT A BOILER REPLACE THAT WITH A HEAT COMP, AND AGAIN AS YOU HEARD OUR CAPITAL FUND DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE ALL THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO MAKE THESE IMPROVEMENTS.  THIS IS HELPING ENSURE WHEN WE DO MAKE THOSE REPLACEMENTS WE'RE NOT DOING A BAND AID, WE'RE INVESTING IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE. CORE SERVICES, NONE OF THIS WILL SURPRISE YOU. A2 ZERO, WE WORK ON EFFICIENCY WEEK, WORKN THE COMMUNITY BROADLY, WHETHER THAT'S THROUGH ENGAGEMENT OR HELPING OUR COMMUNITY MAKE MORE SUSTAINABLY CENTERED INVESTMES AND OF COURSE WE HOLD THE RESILIENCE OFURORE NATURAL SYSTEMS, OF OUR OPLE, AND AS OUR COMMUNIT AS A WHOLE SO THESE ARE THE MRICS TH WE TRACK ON A QUARRLY BASIS. WHEN YOUOOK AT T GENERAL FD, OUR AREMALL.  WE DON'TLA HAVE A LOT.  SO A% CUT FOR  IS AUT 33,000OLLARS SO WRE PROPOSIN A CUT IN AND THE REDUCTI IN THE WE HAV E SOFTWARET TH HELP US DO SOM OF THE ACCOUNTI THAT WE BRING ME OF TTINGO HOUSE.  W ARE, HOWER,SKINGORN INEASE I LEGAL FEES AS OUR WORK IS GETTING MORE AND MORE COMPLICATED YOU HAVE HEARD US TALK BEFORE ABOUT THE NODE FOR SOME OUTSIDE LEGAL COUNCIL, SOME REALLY SPECIALIST COUNCIL, TO HELP US NAVIGATE SOME OF THE REALLY EXCITING BUT ALSO A LITTLE STICKY THINGS THAT ARE COMING IN OUR FUTURE. NEXT SLIDE.  TO CLOSE WITH THAT YOU REALLY ARE AT THE END IN TERMS OF THE HORIZON ISSUES WE FACE.  WE'VE GROUPED THEM IN THE THREE CATEGORIES.  THE FIRST OF COURSE IS FINANCEIAL. SEEKING AND GETTING THE INVETTESMENT TO DO A20. MY COLLEAGUES AND I DID A PHENOMENAL JOB TALKING ABOUT THE INTERSECTION MANY TIMES AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAUGHT IT WASN'T THE FIRE CHIEF TALKING ABOUT THE NET ZERO FIRE STATION OR HOW SUSTAINABLE IS BEING THOUGHT THROUGH IN THE MASTER PLAN PROCESS, BUT REALLY CONTINUING TO WORK COLLABORATIVELY TO INSTITUTIONALIZE THIS WORK SO OSI CAN BE ON THE FRONT -F END OF THIS. AND THEN OF COURSE RESIDENTS DOING THIS IS CRITICAL AS WELL. THE SECOND IS CAPACITY ACROSS THE BOARD. THAT SECURING, TRAINING, MANAGING, MAINTAINING THE HUMAN CAPACITY THAT WE NEED INTERNALLY AND EXTERNALLY TO ACHIEVE A2 ZERO. AND THE LAST IS EXCITING EN MANY FRONTS, AND THAT IS GETTING THE FEDERAL LEGISLATIVE SUPPORT THAT WE NEED IN THE STATE LEGISLATIVE SUPPORT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO THE WORK THAT'S POSSIBLE. YOU KNOW, JUST RECENTLY WE HAVE SEEN A SLEW OF OPPORTUNITIES EMERGE AND WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO STAY ON TOP OF THAT AND HOW WE CAN LEVERAGE THAT WORK, ALSO TELL OUR - - LEGISLATURE - - . LEGISLATURES ABOUT THE THINGS WE NEED TO BE PAYING ATTENTION TO. AND THEN OUR UTILITIES, OUR P, AS WELL AS THE INSTITUTIONS OUR COMMUNITY WORKING COLLABORATIVELY WITH FOLKS LIKE THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN ARCH ARBOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND OF COURSE THE RIDE AND MANY OTHERS SO WE HAVE A NUMBER OF REALLY EXCITING ISSUES, OPPORTUNITIES ON THE HORIZON AND THE POTENTIAL SPEED BUMPS THAT WE'RE LOOKING OUT FOR. SO CAN WITH THAT I THINK MR. CRAWFORD, BACK TO YOU.
01:50:36.544: >> MR. CRAWFORD:  THANK YOU.
