00:03:49.655: >> HI, THANK YOU FOR TAKING MY CALL. MY NAME IS JULIAN CARPENTER, MY ADDRESS IS 1266JUIT AVENUE. I WOULD LIKE TO ASK THE COMMISSIONERS TO MAKE A MOTION TO THE CHAIR TO RECONSIDER THE HOME OCCUPATION'S QUESTION THAT WAS DECIDED DURING THE PLANNING COMMISSION'S LAST MEETING, SPECIFICALLY BY REMOVING OR AMENDING 4H MACHINE SHOP METAL WORKING. I HAVE STARTED AND BUILT A SMALL SPECIAL MANUFACTURING COMPANY IN ANN ARBOR. I HAVE AN INDUSTRIAL PROPERTY THAT WE USE, BUT I WORK WITH SEVERAL PEOPLE WHO WOULD FALL INTO THIS CATEGORY, AND THEY ACROSS THE BOARD ARE CONTRIBUTORS TO THE COMMUNITY & ECONOMY OF THIS AREA.  WE ARE NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE IN THEIR GARAGE GARAGE USING AN ANGLE GRINDER AT 3:00 P.M. VERY SPECIFICALLY THESE PEOPLE DO NOT DO THAT. THEY PRECONNECTFUL, THEIR OPERATIONS ARE QUIET, MOST PEOPLE DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT THEY HAVE ANY EQUIPMENT IN THEIR HOME TO MAKE THINGS, AND THESE ARE OLD PHYSICS PROFESSORS FROM THE UNIVERSITY, EXTREMELY SPECIALIZED MACHINISTS FROM THE INDUSTRY WHO HAVE A DIFFERENT CAREER NOW. AS A MANUFACTURER IN THE AREA, I AND OTHER PARTNER COMPANIES USE THESE HOME MACHINE SHOPS OCCASIONALLY AND REGULARLY FOR ONE SMALL JOB HERE, OR ONE SMALL JOB THERE, AND THEY ARE LARGER PART OF THIS COMMUNITY. AND ECONOMY THAN YOU MIGHT THINK.  AND WE WOULD HAVE A, I DON'T KNOW WHERE WE WOULD GO FOR THOSE VERY SPECIFIC HIGH PROFILE LITTLE ONE OFF JOBS THAT BIG SHOPS WITH BIG BUILDINGS. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A MODIFICATION OF THAT PART OF THE PROPOSAL TO... MY QUESTION HERE IS WHAT PART OF THE REST OF THE CODE OF LIVING IN THIS TOWN DOESN'T HANDLE THE POSSIBLE ISSUES THAT ANNE IRRESPONSIBLE HOME MACHINE SHOP WOULD PRESENT TO THE COMMUNITY. NOR WOULD NOISE, DISRUPTION.
00:06:21.807: >> 30 MORE SECONDS.
00:06:22.741: >> OR MASKS.  THERE ARE ALREADY RULES TO HANDLE THOSE THINGS, WHY DO WE NEED A RULE THAT IMPACTS THE ECONOMY AND THE SKILL SET AND THE CREATIVE ATTITUDE OF THIS TOWN FOR NO APPARENT REASON. THANK YOU.
00:06:35.821: >> THANK YOU.
00:06:47.132: >> CALLER WITH PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 481. CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 481, YOU IS THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
00:06:55.340: >> HI, THERE.  MY NAME IS FRANCES ED SMOND, WHITE, MY ADDRESS IS 4477 KEEBLER COURT. I HAVE AM NOT ENTIRELY FAMILIAR WITH THE REASONING BEHIND THE RECENT CHANGES BUT LISTENING TO VIDEO OF THE MEETING LAST WEEK IT SEEMED TO ME THE PROPOSAL IS BACKED BY GREAT INTENTIONS, BUT MAYBE DOESN'T HAVE THE BREADTH BEHIND THE DISCUSSION OF THE PERSPECTIVE OF PEOPLE WHO INVENT AND FABRICATE THINGS. MUCH LIKE THE PREVIOUS CALLER, I'M A SCIENTIST AND AN ENGINEER. I END UP FABRICATING A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT ONE-OFF PROJECTS FROM MY HOME AS PART OF MY SMALL BUSINESS, INCLUDING 3D PRINTING, ASSEMBLY OF ELECTRONICS, WRITING SOFTWARE, DESIGNING AND MAKING OPTICS AND MECHANICAL SYSTEMS INCLUDING SMALL AMOUNTS OF METAL WORK. I CERTAINLY WOULDN'T TYPICALLY CALL MYSELF A METAL WORKING BUSINESS, BUT CERTAINLY ELEMENTS OF WHAT I DO WOULD INVOLVE METAL WORK. OBVIOUSLY I WOULDN'T WANT TO BE IN VIOLATION OF ANY KIND OF CITY CODES.  MY NEIGHBORS WOULD NEVER KNOW WT I'M UP TO BECAUSE NONE OF IT WOULD DISPLAY FROM THE STREET, DON'T HAVE ANY KIND OF RETAIL PRESENCE, DON'T HAVE EMPLOYEES COMING TO THE HOUSE. IT SEEMS LIKE MOST OF THE CONCERNS THAT WOULD OERSE BE PRESENT ARECCOUNTED FOR BY NOIS ORDINANS,PACE USE ORDINANCES, IN TERMS OF NUMBER OF VISITS TO PROPERTIES. SO IT SEEMS THAT THE ORDINANCE WOULD PUT AN UNDUE BURDEN ON TO PEOPLE IN A VERY SPECIFIC CATEGORY THAT WOULDS PROBABLY BE VERY DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE ANYWAYS BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF HOW PEOPLE WOULD DESCRIBE THEIR OWN BUSINESS.  I CERTAINLY WOULD NEVER DESCRIBE THE PRODUCTS I WOULD MAKE AS ARTISTIC PRODUCTS. THEY'RE DEFINITELY SCIENTIFIC TOOLS, BUT THAT SAID WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SOMEBODY WHO MIGHT BE A NUISANCE IN THE COMMUNITY MAKING A PIECE OF ARTWORK VERSUS A ONE-OFF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENT. I'D SAY IT'S A NUISANCE ANYWAYS. IT'S MUCH BETTER HANDLED THROUGH OTHER MEANS TO PROHIBIT ANY KIND OF BEHAVIOR TAT WOULD BE A PROBLEM IN THE COMMUNITY THROUGH THAT WAY RATHER THAN LABELING BY OCCUPATIONS. THAT'S MY ENTIRE THOUGHT.  I GUESS I SHOULD ALSO SAY I HAVE NO CONTROL OVER DELIVERY SERVICES.
00:09:25.390: >> 30 MORE SECONDS.
00:09:27.392: >> AMAZON, UPS, DHL, THEY HAVE OCCASIONALLY SHOWED UP AT MY HOUSE ON SUNDAYS WELL AFTER 8:0Y NO CONTROL OVER THAT WHETHER IT'S COMMERCIAL OR NON-COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY.
00:09:39.504: >> THANK YOU.
00:09:47.646: >> CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 560. YOU CAN UNMUTE YOUR PHONE AND ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION FOR THREE MINUTES.
00:09:58.690: >> HI, GOOD EVENING COMMISSIONERS, MY NAME IS ROBERT Y LINE NESS, I LIVE AT 6 SOUTHâ€”- COURT ANN ARBOR, 48105. I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO ASK THAT YOU RECONSIDER THE MOTION FOR MACHINE SHOP METAL WORKING. BUT I ALSO THINK THAT THE ENTIRE CHANGE TO 5 DOT 16 DOT 6 DUB H IS PERHAPS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE RECONSIDERED BECAUSE THE PREVIOUS VERSION HAD THE REASONS WHY A FACILITY WOULD BE OBJECTIONABLE. YOU'VE TAKEN OUT THOSE REASONS AND SWITCHED THEM OVER TO THE TYPES OF FACILITIES. WELL, THERE ARE NEW TYPES OF FACILITIES ALL THE TIME. THE REASONS STAY THE SAME.  I'D LIKE TO SEE IT REVERTED BACK. IF YOU CAN'T DO THAT, CERTAINLY MACHINE SHOPS, I DON'T KNOW WHAT CONSTITUTES A MACHINE SHOP. I'M A SMALL BUSINESS CONSULTANT, AND IF I WANT TO BUILD SMALL MACHINES AND SELL THEM, DOES THAT MAKE ME A MACHINE SHOP? SURE, THEY'RE SMALLER THAN A CARD TABLE TOP, BUT NOT, DOES THAT MAKE ME A MACHINE SHOP AND A VIOLATER? I HOPE NOT. BUT IT MIGHT. I HAVE A HIGHLY RESPECTED MUSICAL TEACHER FRIEND WHO HAS A RECORDING STUDIO IN HIS BASEMENT AND BY GOSH HE'S DONE SOME COMMERCIAL RECORDS OUT OF THAT RECORDING STUDIO. IS HE NOW ILLEGAL? IT DOESN'T IRRITATE HIS NEIGHBORS FOR WHAT HE DOES. I THINK CALLING OUT THE OCCUPATIONS THAT ARE OBJECTIONABLE IS A MISTAKE. IT SHOULD BE THE REASONS YOU WANT SOMEBODY TO NOT BE DOING SOMETHING AT THEIR HOUSE. AND THAT WAS PERFECTLY STATED IN THE PREVIOUS VERSION WHERE THERE WAS, YOU KNOW, SHALL NOT GENERATE VIBRATIONS HEARD OFF THE PREMISES. THAT I CAN UNDERSTAND. NOISE, HEARD OFF THE PROPERTY. I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT. THE CURRENT VERSION JUST DOESN'T SEEM FAIR TO VERY MANY PEOPLE AND IT SEEMS UNWISE IN THE LONG-TERM. AND THAT'S WHAT I HAVE TO SAY.
00:12:25.003: >> THANK YOU.
00:12:32.477: >> CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 642. YOU CAN UNMUTE YOUR PHONE. YOU CAN STAR 6 AND ADDRESS THE COMMISSION FOR THREE MINUTES.
00:12:43.521: >> HELLO.  MY NAME IS ELEANOR JONES, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
00:12:48.827: >> WE CAN.
00:12:49.828: >> OKAY, GOOD. I'M AT 1319 OLIVIA ANN ARBOR. I AGREE WHOLE HEARTEDLY WITH THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER BUT ESPECIALLY THE SPEAKER JUST AHEAD OF ME.  I THINK IT IS DISCRIMINATORY TO IDENTIFY SPECIFIC ACTIVITIESES OPPOSED TO THE EFFECTS OF THOSE ACTIVITIES. I THINK THAT THIS CAN BE EASILY AND MORE EFFECTIVELY AND FAIRLY REGULATED BY ADDRESSING WHAT EFFECTS YOU MAY NOT CAUSE, RATHER THAN SINGLING OUT, FOR EXAMPLE, METAL WORK. I THINK THAT METAL WORK SHOULD NAT BE TREATED ANY DIFFERENTLY FROM WOODWORKING. THERE'S NO REASON THAT A PERSON WHO IS CREATING INVENTIONS, DESIGNING NEW TOOLS OR SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS OR ANY NUMBER OF THINGS SHOULD BE TREATED ANY DIFFERENTLY FROM THE PERSON BUILDING THEIR OWN COFFEE TABLE OUT OF WOOD. I WOULD BEG YOU TO CONSIDER REWRITING THIS AS THE EFFECT AS OPPOSED TO OUTLAWING SPECIFIC OCCUPATIONS. THANK YOU.
00:13:57.028: >> THANK THANK YOU.
00:14:04.469: >> CALLER ENDING WITH PHONE NUMBER 660. CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 760.  YOU CAN UNMUTE YOURAL PHONE AND ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION FOR THREE MINUTES.
00:14:14.946: >> HELLO, CAN YOU HEAR ME OKAY?
00:14:18.083: >> WE CAN.
00:14:18.683: >> Y EXCELLENT.  GOOD EVENING, MY NAME IS FRANCES MILLS, I'M AT 5 PARKVIEW PLACE IN WARD 5 OF ANN ARBOR. AND APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK THIS EVENING. I'M A LONGTIME LISTENER TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION BUT THIS IS MY FIRST TIME CALLING. I THINK THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE THIS EVENING THAT CAN HAVE SOME GREAT STORIES TO TELL BUT I'D LIKE TO FOCUS IN PARTICULAR TO START WITH ON PROCESS.  I'M HOPING THIS EVENING THAT SOMEONE ON THE PLANNING COMMISSION CAN MAKE A MOTION TO THE CHAIR FOR RECONSIDERATION OF THE QUESTION THAT WAS DECIDED LAST WEEK ON THE NEW HOME OCCUPATION ORDINANCE, IN PARTICULAR DIRECTED TO YOUR BYLAWS WHICH STATE THAT THE COMMISSIONER VOTING IN MAJORITY HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A QUESTION RECONSIDERED SO LONG AS IT HAPPENS AT THE NEXT REGULAR MEETING. I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S SOME, IT'S UNUSUAL ABOUT NEXT WEEK'S MEETING AND THIS IS A SPECIAL MEETING SO THERE'S PERHAPS SOME AMBIGUITY TO MAKE SURE THE OPPORTUNITY ISN'T MISSED AND REVIEW OF THE BYLAWS, I BELIEVE THAT SPECIAL MEETINGS CAN HAVE ITEMS ADDED SO LONG AS THERE IS UNANIMOUS CUB SENT OF THE COMMISSIONERS INVOLVED. I GUESS FIRST I WOULD ASK FOR YOUR UNANIMOUS CONSENTED. NUMBER TWO, IF THE ISSUE'S RECONSIDERED I WOULD ASK THAT A COMMISSIONER MAKE A MOTION TO THE CHAIR FOR AMENDMENT TO THE LANGUAGE SPECIFICALLY TO REMOVE ARTICLE 4H, THE PROHIBITION ON MACHINE SHOPS SLASH METAL WORKING. I'D APPRECIATE IF A COMMISSIONER COULD SECOND THAT, AND THAT AS A GROUP YOU COULD HAVE A MAJORITY VOTE TO UPHOLD THAT MOTION FOR AMENDMENT, AND APPROVE THE RECONSIDERATION AS AMENDED. ADDITIONALLY I WOULD SAY THERE'S A LARGE COMMUNITY OF MAKERS IN TOWN THAT DO SPECIALIZED METAL WORK. THERE'S A LARGE COMMUNITY OF ARTISTS WHO WORK IN METAL THAT FROM TIME TO TIME HAVE TO HAVE FILL IN WORK BETWEEN THEIR MORE ARTISTIC JOBS AND OFTEN END UP TAKING ON FREELANCE WORK FOR SPECIFIC CONSTRUCTION OR â€”
00:16:46.064: >> 30 MORE SECONDS SHUNNER TASTIC ITEMS.  AND SO I GUESS I WOULD SAY THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF FOLKS OUT THERE, I'M HOPING THAT TONIGHT WE CAN SHOW INTEREST AND I KNOW THAT WITH THE COMING WEEKS WE CAN PROBABLY INCREASE THAT INTEREST. SO THAT. FOR THE INTERVENING COUNCIL MEETINGS AND PERHAPS FIRST READING SECOND READING IF IT'S NOT TAKEN CARE OF TONIGHT, TAKE THE ENERGY IN THE FUTURE TO SAVE THE TIME AND GET IT SORTIED UT TONIGHT THOUGH. THANK YOU.

00:20:13.337: >> THANK YOU YOU SO MUCH FOR TAKE MY CALL. I LIVE AT 16 HARP STREET 48104 D LIK THE OTHER CLERS I ULDIKE TO ASK T TO THE CHAIR FOR RECONSIDERATION OF HOME OCCUPATIONS QUESTION THAT WAS DECIDED DURING THE PLANNING COMMISSION LAST MEETING, SLAVE Y I'D LIKE HOPEâ€”- SPECIFICALLY REMOVE ARTICLE 4H ABOUT MACHINE SHOP AND METAL WORKING. I AGREE WITH THE CALLERS THAT YOU'VE HEARD SO FAR AND I THINK THEY HAVE SPOKEN QUITE ELOQUENTLY ABOUT THE NEED TO CONSIDER RATHER THAN SINGLING OUT SPECIFIC OCCUPATIONS, IT SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON WHAT THE POTENTIAL DAMAGE OR HARM IS FROM THOSE OCCUPATIONS SO THINGS LIKE NOISE ORDINANCES AND PARKING ORDINANCES AND SO ON ARE REALLY THE APPROPRIATE WAY TO REGULATE THIS KIND OF ACTIVITY. RATHER THAN TRYING TO RESTATE WHAT THEY'VE SAID SO WELL, I JUST WANT TO SHARE A LITTLE PERSONAL EXPERIENCE OF MINE. I GREW UP HERE IN ANN ARBOR, AND A FRIEND OF MINE, HIS FATHER HAD A MACHINE SHOP IN HIS GARAGE AND HE DID MOSTLY TINKERING IN THAT MACHINE SHOP, HE ALSO DID SOME PROFESSIONAL WORK FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, HE WAS A MACHINIST BY TRADE.  I GREW UP AS A TEENAGER WATCHING HIM MAKE METAL PARTS FABRICATING FROM SCRATCH, JUST ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, STARTING WITH A BLOCK OF METAL, SPENDING AND ENDING UP WITH SOMETHING.
00:23:45.383: >> 984, YOU'RE UNMUTED YOU CAN ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
00:23:55.292: >> MAYBE WE'LL â€” WE'LL COME BACK TO YOU.
00:24:06.337: >> CALLER WITH PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 981.
00:24:33.964: >> I'VE LIVED HERE FOR 15 YEARS, I GREW UP IN ANN ARBOR, AND I'M CALLING IN TONIGHT TO VOICE MY CONCERN AND ASK THE COMMISSIONERS TO MAKE A MOTION TO THE CHAIR FOR RECONSIDERATION OF THE HOME OCCUPATIONS QUESTION THAT WAS DECIDED DURING THE PLANNING COMMISSIONERS LAST MEETING. AND ALSO TO ASK MORE SPECIFICALLY THE COMMISSIONERS TO AMEND THE RECONSIDERED MOTION BY REMOVING ARTICLE 4H, MACHINE SHOP SLASH METAL WORKING. I DON'T CURRENTLY RUN A HOME METAL WORKING SHOP BUSINESS BUT I HAVE A HOBBY SHOP THAT I USE AND OCCASIONALLY THROUGHOUT THE YEARS I HAVE DONE SOME SUBCONTRACT WORK, SMALL SPECIALIZED ITEMS FOR LOCAL BUSINESS OWNERS EN TOWN, RESEARCHERS, THINGS LIKE THAT. I HAVE A FULL-TIME JOB IN SALES BUT OCCASIONALLY HAVE TAKEN ON SMALL SPECIALIZED JOBS IN PARTICULAR EMERGENCY WORK AS SOMETHING THAT I'VE DONE OVER THE YEARS WHEN SOMETHING HAS TO BE BACK ONLINE AND NEEDS TO BE REPAIRED QUICKLY. COMING FROM BEING BORN AND RAISE IN ANN ARBOR, MICHIGAN, ONE OF THE MOST WONDERFUL THINGS ABOUT IT WAS MY EXPOSURE TO ALL OF THE INTERESTING, TALENTED PEOPLE IN TOWN AND I CAME FROM A FAMILY I'M IN SOME WAYS A THIRD GENERATION METAL WORKING PERSON. MY GRANDFATHER WAS A TOOLMAKER AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AFTER HE IMGREATED WITH MY FATHER AND OF COURSE HIS WIFE. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN IN MY BLOOD FOR GENERATIONS. I THINK IT'S JUST VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE DON'T PROHIBIT PEOPLE FROM DOING THINGS IN THEIR OWN HOMES TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE ECONOMY AND AID LOCAL BUSINESSES AND RESEARCHERS AND WHATNOT. I'D ALSO LIKE TO THANK EVERYBODY, PARTICIPANTS AND COMMISSIONERS AND WHATNOT OFFICIALS AND I'D LIKE TO SAY THANK YOU TO EVERYONE FOR CRIB OUGHT OUTING TO â€” CONTRIBUTING TO YOUR CIVIC DUTY. THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY I APPRECIATE EVERYBODY LISTENING AND HOPE THAT'S HELPFUL, THANKS.

METAL WORKING ORDINANCE OR SOMETHING ABOUT THAT. NOT SO GOOD WITH THOSE DETAILS. I JUST WANTED TO TELL THE STORY OF WHAT I'M GOING GOING TO CALL THE SECRET SPACE PROGRAM OF BURNS PARK. SO. MACHINE SHOP AT BURNS PARK FOR SEVERAL PATENTED INVENTIONS AND PROTOTYPES, SOME SOME OF WHICH WERE TO BE FLOWN ON THE SPACE SHUTTLE.  WE WEREN'T THE ONLY FAMILY WITH AN IMPORTANT HOME MACHINE SHOP IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD EITHER. HIS BUDDY'S SHOP WAS JUST A COUPLE OF BLOCK SAWAY. AGAIN. THESE ARE PROJECTS THAT FLEW IN OUTER SPACE IN THE 90S. IT'S A VERY POSITIVE IMPACT THAT THESE HOME VENDOR CAN HAVE, MY DAD WAS WORKING AT THE TIME WHEN HE MADE THE THE WORK SHOP SORT OF FINANCED BY GOVERNMENT PROJECT TO DO RESEARCH BEHIND A FACILITY IN OUTER SPACE THAT WAS TO DO RESEARCH ON CONDUCTORS IN A GREATER VACUUM AND 0G AND ALL THAT. THIS IS TECHNOLOGY THAT SORT OF ENABLED ONE WAY OR ANOTHER HIM AND PEOPLE LIKE HIM THE iPHONE CONVENIENCE CULTURE THAT WE HAVE NOW AND TAKE FOR GRANTED AND WE ALL DEPEND ON. I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S NOT GIVING FAIR DUE, ESPECIALLY PROFESSIONALLY.
00:29:25.856: >> 30 MORE SECONDS.
00:29:26.790: >> MAYBE EVEN ENCOURAGED MORE VIGOROUSLY THAN JUST DOING IT FOR ARTS SAKE. TO DO IT AS YOUR LIVELIHOOD SHOULD NOT BE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST. THAT'S IT I'M DROPPING THE MIC.

00:30:52.976: >> WE CAN HEAR YOU, YEP GO AHEAD.
00:30:57.881: >> MY NAME IS - - I LIVE ON 1989 WEST LIBERTY STREET IN ANN ARBOR.  MY PRIMARY OCCUPATION IS WOODWORKER, NOT METALWORKER, AS IT WERE, BUT IT CONCERNS ME THE ARBITRARINESS OF PICKING OUT METALWORKING SHOPS AS BEING UNACCEPTABLE AS A HOME OCCUPATION.  I'M A LITTLE WORRIED THAT NEXT YEAR MAYBE IT WILL BE WOODWORKING OR THE YORE AFTER THAT IT WILL BE POTTERY. I SEE NO RATIONALE BEHIND THAT DECISION FOR THIS ORDINANCE. AS A RESULT, I WOULD ASK THAT THE ARTICLE 4H IN THE PROPOSAL BE RECONSIDERED AND PERHAPS A BETTER WAY OF ADDRESSING THIS WOULD BE THROUGH EXISTING ORDINANCES.  THE ORDINANCE IS ALREADY REGULATING TIME FROM 8 TO 8 DURING THE DAY, NOISE, UM, AND I THINK IT'S JUST WITH A SOLUTION LOOKING FOR A PROBLEM. THAT'S PRETTY MUCH ALL I HAVE HAVE HAVE TO.
00:32:13.524: >> THANK YOU.

00:32:41.818: >> HELLO MY NAME IS QUEST, I LIVE AT 1518 GRANGER IN ANN ARBOR, AND I DO NOT HAVE - - I'M CALLING REGARDING THE RECENT BAN ON MACHINE SHOPS IN ANN ARBOR. I DON'T HAVE A MACHINE SHOP MYSELF BUT I DO HAVE A NEIGHBOR WHO LIVES CLOSE BY WHO DOES AND IT'S NEVER BEEN A PROBLEM, THERE'S NOT REALLY ANY NOISE IT'S NEVER BEEN AN ISSUE. I WOULD LIKE TO ADD TO MY VOICE TO THE CHORUS OF OTHER CALLERS THAT HAVE GIVEN A LOT OF GOOD REASONS WHY THIS CHANGE SHOULD BE REPEALED. I AGREE WITH THE OTHER CALLERS THEY'RE DOING A BLANKET BAN ON ONE SPECIFIC INDUSTRY IS NOT REALLY A GOOD WAY TO SOLVE A PROBLEM.  MAYBE BETTER WAYS WOULD BE AS OTHER PEOPLE HAVE SAID A NOISE ORDINANCE OR A NUISANCE ORDINANCE, BUT TO DO A BLANKET BAN TO ME DOES NOT MAKE SENSE.  IT'S KIND OF A SLIPPERY SLOPE. THAT'S IT, I'M GOING TO KEEP IT BRIEF, I KNOW YOU HAVE A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE THAT NEED TO SPEAK SO I JUST WANTED TO GIVE MY TWO CENTS. THANK YOU.
00:33:55.959: >> THANK YOU.
00:34:04.635: >> CALLER WITH THE PHONE NEBRASKA ENDING WITH 684 YOU CAN UNMUTE YOUR PHONE USING STAR 6 TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION.

00:34:16.113: >> WE CAN, GO AHEAD.
00:34:19.349: >> SO GEORGE - - 424 LITTLE LAKE DRIVE ANN ARBOR MICHIGAN I'D LIKE TO BRING UP A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT IT SEEMS THIS IS AN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE I HAVEN'T HEARD ANYBODY CALLING AND SAYING IT WAS A GREAT IDEA. BUT IN MY FATHER'S GENERATION, EVERY CHICKEN COOP AND BARN AND GARAGE HAD A MACHINE SHOP IN IT MAKING PARTS FOR THE WAR EFFORT. THAT MAY SEEM VERY DISTANT BUT A YEAR AGO EVERYBODY I KNEW IN THE MAKER COMMUNITY WAS MAKING PPE. OR SOMETHING TO HELP OUT WITH COVID. WE HAD DISCUSSIONS ABOUT MAKING OXYGEN SEPARATORS FOR PEOPLE THAT MIGHT HAVE NEED THEM IF THEY WERE IN THE HOSPITALS AND THERE'S BEEN EXAMPLES OF PEOPLE RUNNING OUT. THESE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE AND 3D PLINTING RIGHT NOW IT'S PLASTIC MOST SHOPS CAN'T AFFORD METAL MAKING ONES BUT YOU CAN DO CASTING TO CONVERT WAX INTO JEWELRY, CONVERT PARTS THE TO METAL SO RATHER THAN SEE A DIMINISHMENT OF THIS, I THINK THIS IS A RESOURCE THAT CAN HELP SOCIETY AND AS TOOLS BECOME CHEAPER AND MORE AVAILABLE YOU CAN NOW MAKE SOME OF YOUR OWN CNC MACHINES TO MACHINE METAL AND WOOD AND THAT'S THE DIRECTION I THINK WE SHOULD BE GOING. THIS MUST HAVE BEEN AN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE. I THANK YOU FOR BEING THE DESIGNATED SPEAR CATCHERS TONIGHT.
00:36:02.285: >> THERE'S ONE MORE PERSON IN LINE SO IF ANYONE ELSE WOULD LIKE TO JOIN THE QUEUE PLEASE PRESS STAR 9 TO RAISE YOUR HAND AGAIN THIS IS A OPPORTUNITY FOR PUBLIC COMMENT ON SOMETHING THAT'S NOT ON THE AGENDA WHICH IS THE TRANSIT CORRIDOR ZONE.

00:36:39.456: >> MY NAME IS THOMAS VOLERIO, I LIVE AT 404 WESTWOOD IN ANN ARBOR. I AGREE WITH EVERYONE ELSE THAT'S SPOKEN AND WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A COUPLE OF COMMENTS ABOUT MY EXPERIENCES. I'M AN IT PERSON BUT I SPENT MY LIFE WORKING AROUND SHOPS, WOODWORKING, ALL KINDS OF SHOPS, AND I HAD AN EX NEIGHBOR WHO'S GONE NOW WHO HAD A WOODWORKING SHOP. THERE WAS A FAIR AMOUNT OF NOISE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE WHOLE RATIONALE IS FOR ALL OF THIS BUT I DO METALWORKING HERE NOT ALWAYS PROFESSIONALLY, BUT OFTENTIMES THERE WAS FAR MORE NOISE COMING FROM MY NEIGHBOR'S WOODWORKING SHOP THAN NOISE I'VE EVER MADE. ONE OTHER COMMENT I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE IS A FRIEND OF MINE THAT I'VE KNOWN FOR PROBABLY ABOUT 30 YEARS AT LEAST ABOUT 40 YEARS AGO HE WAS A RECENT GRADUATE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AND HE WAS HAVING A HARD TIME FINDING WORK. HE END UP ACQUIRING A METALWORKING LATHE THAT HE PURCHASED FROM SOMEBODY, TOOK IT TO HIS HOUSE HE WAS LIVING WITH HIS PARENTS AND HE HI PARENTS HOME HAD AN EXPOSED BASE.  AND HE WAS JUST A 20 SOMETHING AT THE TIME AND STARTED A SMALL HOME BUSINESS USING THAT METALWORKING LATHE. NOW THAT BUSINESS 35, FORT YEARS LATER I DON'T HAVE ANY ACCESS TO ANY SPECIFIC FINANCIAL INFORMATION, BUT I'M GUESSING THAT OVER THE 35 CAREERS THAT THIS PERSON'S BEEN IN BUSINESS, THAT THEY'VE CONTRIBUTED PROBABLY BETWEEN 50 AND 100 MILLION-DOLLARS TO THE WASHENNA COUNTY ECONOMY.
00:39:09.139: >> 30 MORE SECONDS AND I GUESS THAT'S ALL I WANT TO SAY. THIS MEETS THIS METAL WORK WORKING OCCUPATION NEEDS TO BE RECONSIDERED BECAUSE IT'S YOU'RE REALLY SYMEYING STYMIEING THE WHERE BUSINESSES GET STARTED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

I DID A HUGE AMOUNT OF EXHIBIT WORK IN MY BASEMENT WITH MY MACHINE TOOLS LIVING ON MAIN STREET AT THE TIME WITHOUT THOSE TOOLS MANY OF THOSE EXHIBITS IN THAT MUSEUM WOULD NOT EXIST BECAUSE THE MUSEUM DID NOT HAVE THE MONEY TO HIRE TO BUY THOSE MACHINES AND HAVE THEM A PLACE TO PUT THEM. I HAD THE SKILLS AND I WAS ABLE TO USE THOSE IN MY WORK. SIMILARLY, SOME OF YOU MAY REMEMBER RICHARD DOT CRAB A RETIRED PHYSICIST FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, HE DID THE SAME THING.  SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN MAKING THAT MUSEUM WHAT IT IS TODAY. I WOULD REALLY ASK YOU TO CONSIDER WHAT EVERYBODY'S BEEN SAYING TONIGHT.

NONE OF THESE ACTIVITIES ARE ILLEGAL BUT IT WAS NICE IF WE NEEDED SOMETHING WELDED WE HAD A WELDER AROUND THE BLOCK. IT'S A WONDERFUL COMMUNITY.

00:43:39.075: >> THANK YOU.
00:43:48.785: >> CALLER 388. YOU CAN PRESS STAR 6 TO UNMUTE YOUR PHONE AND ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
00:44:01.097: >> I'M ALSO CALLING TO ASK YOU TO RECONSIDER YOUR POSITION ON 4H SPECIFICALLY BUT PROBABLY FOUR IN GENERAL OF THE OCCUPATIONS CONVERSATION.  MY NAME IS TOM AND I'M CALLING FROM 2732 END GLADE DRIVE HERE IN ANN ARBOR, MICHIGAN. I SPENT ABOUT 10 YEARS AS AN OWNER AT THE ORGANIZATION SERVING THE ENTREPRENEURIAL COMMUNITY AND WE FND OURSELVES IN THE MIDDL OF A FINANCIAL CRISIS A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO A POPULAR QUESTION IN MY GROUP OF FRIENDS WASHOULD THE FEDERAL GOVERNNT FINCE A MANHTAN-STE PROJECTR STEAD SHOULD IT FINANCE 100,000 GARAGES TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS. I WAS SO TAKEN BY THE CONCEPT OF SERVING THE COMMUNITY BY WAY OF 100,000 GARAGES THAT I WORKED WITH MY PARTNER DALE GROVER TO FOUND MAKER WORKS ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF ANN ARBOR. MAKER WORKS IS A MAKER SPACE SPECIFICALLY DEDICATEED TO MANY OF THE CRAFTS AND WITH RESPECT TO MACHINE SHOP AND WOODWORKING. IT HAS BEEN HARD TO THINK IT HAS BEEN OUR DISTINCT PLEASURE TO SERVE - - IT IS TROUBLING TO ME THAT WE WOULD CONSIDER DOING ANYTHING THAT WOULD MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO RETAIN OUR CAPABILITIES IN THESE TRADES AS I HAVE DEDICATED A FAIR BIT OF TIME OVER THE LAST 10 YEARS TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR COMMUNITY AND OUR TRADE AND OUR SKILLS IS PASSED ON TO THE NEXT GENERATION. TO HAVE INDIVIDUALS LIKE JOHN, WHO ARE WHO HAVE SINGLE HANDEDLY IT SEEMS MANAGED TO KEEP THESE TRADES ALIVE. THERE ARE MANY OTHERS OF COURSE BUT JOHN HAS BEEN AN ACTIVE PART OF THE COMMUNITY COMMUNITY AND IT'S HARD FOR ME TO CONCEIVE OF AN ANN ARBOR WHERE JOHN IS NOT ALLOWED AS AN EXAMPLE TO CONTINUE TO DO WHAT HE DID AND NOT SHARE HIS GIFTS AND SHARE HIS TALENTS AND ENSURE THESE TRADES AND SKILLS ARE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE. ANYTHING WE WOULD DO THAT WOULD GET IN THE WAY OF THAT TO ME WOULD BE PROBLEMATIC. I APPRECIATE YOUR RECONSIDERATION OF THE PROHIBITED HOME OCCUPATIONS IT SHOULD BE THE ACTIVITIES NOT THE OCCUPATIONS THAT ARE PROHIBITED THANK YOU AGAIN SO MUCH FOR TAKING OUR CALLS AND RECONSIDERING YOUR POSITION ON THIS.

00:46:46.162: >> HI, THIS IS JOSH WILLIAMS FOLLOWING UP ON THE COMMENTS ONE OF THE MANAGERS HERE AT MAKER WORKS AND JUST TO ADD TO LITTLE BIT TO THAT WE'VE GOT ABOUT 2500 PEOPLE THAT HAVE COME THROUGH THE MAKER WORKS DOORS THAT ARE FROM ANN ARBOR AND WE ESTIMATE THAT ROUGHLY 70 PERCENT OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE USING THE SPACE TO PURSUE SOME SORT OF FINANCIAL GAIN.  MANY OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE DOING WORK FROM HOME AND THEY'RE RELYING ON US FOR SOME SPECIALTY TOOLS THAT WE HAVE. JUST OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD THAT RANGES FROM PEOPLE THAT HAVE A BUSINESS DOING JUKE BOX REPAIR, BUILDING MUSEUM EXHIBITS, PROFESSORS THAT ARE WORKING ON MEDICAL IMAGING, SCIENTISTS WORKING ON OPTICS TO i FLY FIE PLANTS AND THEIR HEALTH, START-UPS FROM PEOPLE WORKING ON CARS TO ADAPTING CELL PHONES, PEOPLE WORKING WORKING ON FURNITURE DESIGN, PEOPLE DOING CUSTOM RESTAURANT EQUIPMENT FOR LOCAL BAGEL FACT OTHERS - - MUSICAL EQUIPMENT, SELLING CUSTOM PHOTOGRAPHY RIGS.  THAT'S WHAT I CAN THINK OF IN ABOUT TWO MINUTES OUT OF THAT 2500 PEOPLE WE'VE HAD WALK THROUGH OUR DOORS WITH THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR ADDRESS. AND SIMILARLY TO WHAT PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY SAID MANY OF THOSE PEOPLE COME WITH STORIES.  I LOVE LISTENING TO THE STORY THAT COME INTO THE SHOP ABOUT WHAT GOT THEM INTERESTED IN TOOLS AND ONE OF THE MOST COMMON THREADS IS I HAD A PARENT WHO HAD A MACHINE SHOP IN THEIR BASEMENT OR THEY HAD A SMALL BUSINESS DOING SOME CUSTOM FABRICATION WORK ON THEIR PROPERTY. THIS IS JUST ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT WOULD MAKE IT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT FOR PEEP TOOL HAVE ACCESS TO SEE AND EXPERIENCE TOOLS. I THINK THAT'S ABOUT ALL I HAD TO SAY RECONSIDER LISTING METAL FABRICATION METAL WORKING AS A PROHIBITED HOMOLOGY OPATION AND I APPRECIATE EVERYONE HERE THAT'S VOICED THAT CONCERN AND I APPRECIATE EVERYONE HERE THAT'S ON THE RECEIVING END I THINK TO LISTEN TO US.

00:49:29.492: >> WE CAN, GO AHEAD.
00:49:32.061: >> GREAT. I'LL KEEP IT BRIEF. LIKE SO MANY OF THE OTHER FOLKS HERE, I'VE GOT FAMILY MEMBERS WHO HAVE DONE SIMILAR WORK, MY DAD HAD A MACHINE SHOP THAT WAS MOSTLY FOR HOBBY PURSES BUT ALSO OCCASIONALLY FOR SMALL JOBS AND I REALLY THINK THAT WE NEED TO FOCUS ON BEHAVIORS AND AFFECTS RATHER THAN ON WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH. AND THAT'S ALL I REALLY HAD TO SAY. BUT THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR SERVICE AND FOR TAKING THE TIME TO LISTEN TO US.  FLUSH.
00:50:06.028: >> THANK YOU. TWO MORE PEOPLE IN THE LINE. IF ANYBODY ELSE STAR 9 ON YOUR PHONE.

CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 223. YOU CAN UNMUTE YOUR PHONE AND ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION FOR THREE MINUTES. STAR 6 TO UNMUTE YOUR PHONE.

00:51:02.051: >> OKAY. DON JONES HERE AM I ON THE LINE?
00:51:03.653: >> YOU, GO AHEAD.
00:51:04.520: >> HELLO. OKAY, VERY WELL.  WELL, IT'S KIND OF A SELFISH ON MY PART I'D LIKE TO CONTINUE A CAREER OF INNOVATION AND CREATION I WORK ROUGHLY 35 YEARS OF UNIVERSITY RETIRED 20 YEARS AGO. I STILL GET QUESTIONS AND REQUESTS FROM SMALL PARTS ONCE IN A WHILE FOR THOSE WHO NEED THEM. OVER THE YEARS WITH THE UNIVERSITY I WAS THE MECHANICAL PROBLEM SOLVER. MY SKILLS ARE A SET OF TAKING CARE OF THAT PARTICULAR AREA OF EXPERTISE. I'VE BEEN CREATIVE ALL MY LIFE. I LOVE IT, AND TO TAKE IT AWAY THIS POINT IN TIME BY WAY OF MY MACHINERY, IT'S LIFE FOR ME. ON MY TABLE AT THIS POINT IN TIME I'M REDESIGNING A CROSS BOW WHICH IS ENTIRELY PERSONAL. I HAVE IN FACT RACED ICEBOATS, HARD WATER SAILING, IF YOU WILL, WHICH REQUIRES ALMOST ENTIRELY HAND-BUILT COMPONENTS OF WHICH MACHINING IS AND WOODWORKING. CONSIDERING THAT A MILL AND A LATHE ARE THE MACHINES WHICH MAKE MACHINES SO THE BASIS OF MAKING ANYTHING YOU WANT AS FAR AS MECHANICAL. OR IN FACT - - WELL, ANYWAY. SO I'VE GOT MY FINGER TIPS, FINGER PRINTS WHICH HAVE BEEN WASHED OFF OF PLANETARY PROBES, ROCKETS, STATIONS IN ANTARCTICA, AND GREENLAND, AND JUST A NUMBER OF BEAUTIFUL PROJECTS THAT WERE JUST INSPIRING TO WORK ON. I LOVE WORK. IT ALL STARTED WITH MY FATHER HAVING A MACHINE SHOP, MANY YEARS AGO. AND IT WOULD BE A MISS IF I COULD NAT HAVE MY TOYS TO PLAY WITH. TODAY I'M 87 YEARS OLD AND I STILL ENJOY MAKING THINGS. AND IT'S JUST, UH, IT WOULD BE KIND OF A DISAPPOINTMENT TO LOSE THE MACHINE SHOP. OR THE SHOP OR THE METAL MACHINING THAT I'M WORKING WITH DAY AFTER DAY. THAT'S NOT EXCURSION AT THIS POINT IN TIME.  NOR WAS IT REALLY WHEN I WAS WORKING FOR THE UNIVERSITY BECAUSE I GOT EVERYTHING MADE THERE â€”
00:53:34.637: >> 30 MORE SECONDS.
00:53:35.604: >> ALL RIGHT. WELL, I MUST SIGN OFF IT'S KIND OF BEEN A WONDERFUL TIME TO DO ALL THESE CREATIVE THINGS INVOLVING MACHINING. SO I THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THE ISSUE AND SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH.  BYE.
00:53:52.154: >> THANK YOU.
00:53:57.693: >> CALL CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 034.  CALL CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 034. YOU CAN UNMUTE YOUR PHONE USING STAR 6 AND ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
00:54:11.173: >> THIS IS JOE GLENDORF AT 1417 LAS VEGAS.  I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO REQUEST THE PLANNING COMMISSION TO RECONSIDER THE MACHINING AT HOME DECISION. I DO KNOW ONE PERSON WHO LOST HIS JOB AS A MECHANICAL ENGINEER DURING COVID, AND HE MAKES A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY DOING CAD DESIGN CONSULTING AND AT TIMES HE HAS TO FABRICATE PARTS IN HIS GARAGE. THAT'S WHAT HE CAN DO TO MAKE A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY AT THE MOMENT BECAUSE HE'S BEEN LAID OFF. I ALSO KNOW A FOURTH PERSON IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD, HE AND HIS SON MAKE SMALL PARTS TO SELL TO HELP RAISE MONEY FOR HIS SON'S COLLEGE TUITION AND IT HAS BEEN A HUGE BENEFIT TO HIM. HE DOES IT IN THE GARAGE AND HE HAS NEVER BOTHERED ME ONCE.  YOU WOULD NEVER KNOW HE'S DONE ANYTHING IN HIS GARAGE UNLESS YOU WALKED RIGHT UP TO IT.ING FORSEN. ALSO I CONSIDER THAT AT ONE POINT BACK IN THE 70S AND EARLY 80S I BELIEVE THE LARGEST PRIVATE EMPLOYER IN ANN ARBOR WAS A COMPANY THAT DID SOFTWARE CNC CONTROLS CALLED MDSI AND YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE HISTORY OF ANN ARBOR.  THANK YOU.
00:55:50.973: >> IF THERE'S ANYONE ELSE THAT WISHES TO PROVIDE A PUBLIC COMMENT ABOUT ANYTHING EXCEPT TRANSIT CORRIDORS, YOU RAISE YOUR HAND BY PRESSING STAR 9. GOING ONCE, GOING TWICE. OKAY. BEFORE MOVING ON, JUST BY WAY OF CLARIFICATION, BECAUSE WE DON'T OFTEN - - SINCE I'VE BEEN ON COMMISSION THERE'S NEVER BEEN ANYTHING FOR RECONSIDERATION, CAN YOU TELL US HOW THAT WORKS?
00:56:23.672: >> SURE. A MOTION CAN BE MADE TO RECONSIDER AN ITEM THAT WAS PASSED THAT CAN BE PROPOSED BY ANY MEMBER OF THE PREVAILING SIDE, IN THIS THIS CASE ANYBODY WHO VOTED IN FAVOR OF THE HOM OCCUPATIONRDINANCE, A THE APPRRIE TIMEO ME SH MOTIONOR RECONSIDERATION WOULD BE AT THE APRIL 20TH MEETING, THE NEXT REGULARLY SCHEDULED MEETING OF THE PLANNING COMMISSION. ALTERNATIVELY, THE CHAIR COULD ELECT TO JUST PLACE IT ON THE AGENDA ON THE 20TH OR CONSIDERATION WITHOUT INITIATING ACTION AT THE 20TH.
00:57:03.345: >> OKAY. SO, EITHER WAY IT SEEMS LIKE NEXT MEETING IS THE TIME THAT MAKES SENSE TO TALK ABOUT THIS. WHETHER THROUGH SOMEONE BRINGING IT UP, I MEAN, UH, WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE I'M NOT A HUNDRED PERCENT SURE.  FLUSH -RPB.
00:57:29.672: >> IF THERE'S A WIDE CONSENSUS FROM PLANNING COMMISSION NOW, I WOULD JUST TAKE THAT DIRECTION TO WORK WITH YOU TO PLACE IT ON THE AGENDA FOR RECONSIDERATION ON THE 20TH.
00:57:40.349: >> I WOULD INDICATE DIRECTION IN THAT DIRECTION.
00:57:42.951: >> MOVED BY COMMISSIONER DISCH AND SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL-RANDALL AND WHERE SEE SECOND BY LEE AND ABE R-PBZ YOU'RE UNMUTED THAT'S A THUMBS UP RATHER THAN A COMMENT.
00:58:00.035: >> SECOND THE MOTION.
00:58:00.936: >> THERE WERE MANY, MANY SECONDS. OKAY.  SO IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS WILL BE AN AGENDA ITEM ON OUR NEXT MEETING FOR DISCUSSION THAT WILL BE NEXT TUESDAY. THAT IS ANOTHER UNIQUE MEETING IN THAT IT IS OUR JOINT WITH TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION SO WHERE IT IS WILL LIKELY BE AT THE END OF THAT AGENDA AFTER WE'VE DONE OUR JOINT BUSINESS TOGETHER. WE'LL WORK ON THAT AND THANK YOU. VERY MUCH. ANYBODY WHO'S ON THE LINE CALLING IN, NEXT WEEK AT 7:00 P.M., THAT'S WHEN WE RECONVENE AND IT WILL BE TELEVISED.  IF THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE. OKAY. NEXT UP IS UNFINISHED BUSINESS. WHICH IS THE AMENDMENT TO CHAPTER 55 UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE TO CREATE A NEW TRANSIT DISTRICT FOR TRANSIT CORRIDORS AND THIS IS FOR CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL. WE HAVE A PRESENTATION THAT THE PLANNING COMMISSIONERS ARE SEEING IN FRONT OF US NOW AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WILL BE AVAILABLE PRESUMABLY IN THE RECORDING. JUST FOR THOSE WHO ARE ON THE LINE FOR THIS ITEM, WE WILL HOLD PUBLIC HEARING AFTER THE STAFF PRESENTATION BEFORE OUR DISCUSSION. GO AHEAD.
00:59:33.896: >> THANK YOU. THANK YOU. FOR ANYONE INTERESTED, I'LL BE GOING OVER SOME SLIDES THAT ARE ALREADY UP ON THE WEBSITE THE CITY WEBSITE IS A2 OF DOT ORG, AND THE EASIEST WAY IS TO GO DEPARTMENTS AND PLANNING, CHOOSE PLANNING, AND ON THE PLANNING CHANGES THERE ARE CITY INITIATIVES. AMONG THE, THERE'S A DOCUMENT LIBRARY, THIS IS ALREADY UP THERE ON THE DOCUMENT LIBRARY. I'LL START A LITTLE BIT SLOW IN IN CASE ANYONE IS NAVIGATING TO THE WEBSITE. THIS AGENDA ITEM IS AN ORDINANCE TO CREATE A NEW ZONING DISTRICT NAMED TC1, OR TRANSIT CORRIDOR AS A WAY OF A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND THE PLANNING COMMISSION POSTPONED ACTION ON THESE AMENDMENTS FOLLOWING A PUBLIC HEARING LAST TUESDAY, APRIL 6, SEVERAL REVISIONS WERE REQUESTED AND HAVE BEEN MADE AND I'LL DESCRIBE THOSE NOW. FIRST TO THE INTENT STATEMENT IT'S BEEN REVISED TO ELIMINATE REFERENCES TO SPECIFIC TRANSIT CORRIDORS ADDED IN OUR REFERENCES TO THE P PARKING AND R5 HOTEL DISTRICT. AND THE LANGUAGE ABOUT FRONTING ON THE TRANSIT CORRIDOR HAS BEEN RELAXED. ANOTHER CHANGE WAS TO THE USE TABLE PARKING STRUCTURES WERE ADDED AS A EXPECTORY USE IN THE TC1 DISTRICT AND THEN THE LAST COLUMN THERE'S A REFERENCE TO THE USE SPECIFIC STANDARDS FOR PARKING STRUCTURES. I'M NOW ON SLIDE FOUR. AND A NEW SECTION HAS BEEN ADDED TO THE PROPOSED ORDINANCE AND WE'VE INSERTED SECTION 5163L FROM THE UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE AND WE ARE ADDING A SUB SECTION TO REFERENCE THE T TC DISTRICT SAYING THAT WE ARE BASIS LANGUAGE OFF THE D1 DISTRICT SAYING THAT IN A TC1 DISTRICT, THE PARKING STRUCTURE IN A BUILDING ADJACENT TO THE STREET MUST BE SEPARATED FROM THE STREET BY A USE YOU CAN HAVE PARKING ON THE FIRST FLOOR OF A BUILDING, BUT FRONTING THE STREET HAS TO BE SOME SORT OF SHOP, OFFICE, SO FORTH. SLIDE 5 DESCRIBES THE CHANGES TO THE TRACTION -T CORRIDOR DEVELOPMENT USE SPECIFIC STANDARD. SUBSTANTIVE CHANGES ARE REDUCING THE MINIMUM HEIGHT OF THE TOWN HOUSE APARTMENT BUILDING FROM THREE STORIES TWO, THE MINIMUM HEIGHT REQUIRED IS TWO STORIES. WE'VE ADDED A REQUIREMENT FOR STREET-FACING ENTRANCES FOR APARTMENT BUILDING, REQUIREMENT THAT GARAGE DOORS NOT FACE ANY STREET, REDUCED THE DEDUCTION FOR BILLING FRONTAGE ON SMALL LOTS FROM FUNCTIONALLY 60 FEET, IT WAS 30 FEET PLUS ANY SIDE SET BACK REQUIRED WHICH HAPPENS TO BE 30 FEET AS WELL, TO A REQUIREMENT FOR 30 FEET OR 45 FEET WHEN AD JACE TONIGHT OUR ZONING.  THIS REPRESENTS THE 30 FEET ALLOWANCE FOR DRIVEWAY SIDE WALK LEANING TOWARDS THE REAR AND WE HAVE ADDED A REQUIREMENT THAT WITHIN 100 FEET OF AN INTERSECTION, TOWN HOUSE AND APARTMENT BUILDINGS ARE PROHIBITED AND THE FIRST STORY OF A NEXT USE BUILDING MUST BE A NON-RESIDENTIAL USE. THE NON-SUBSTANTIVE CHANGE IS MOVING THE MINIMUM HEIGHT AND SECOND STORY COVERAGE REQUIREMENT FROM THESE USE SPECIFIC STANDARDS INTO THE DIMENSIONAL STANDARDS. MOVING TO SLIDE 6, THIS ILLUSTRATES WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE DIMENSIONAL STANDARDS TABLE. THE CHANGE HERE IS INCLUDING THE MINIMUM HEIGHT. IF YOU WILL NOTICE THE MINIMUM HEIGHT IS TWO STORIES. THERE IS NOT A FOOT REQUIREMENT. AND THE FOOTNOTE C HAS BEEN REMOVED FROM THE SIDE STEP BACK. IT WOULD HAVE REQUIRED ADDITIONAL BASED ON THE HEIGHT OF THE BUILDING. IT WAS NOT OUR INTENTION TO DO THAT SO WE HAVE REMOVED THE FOOTNOTE FROM THE TABLE. THE NOTE THAT THERE IS AN INTERACTIVE MAP TOOL THAT HAS BEEN CREATED FOR ANYONE LISTENING IF YOU HAVE FOUND THE SLIDE SHOW ON THE WEB PAGE THEN THAT SAME PAGE HAS THE INTERACT ACTIVE MAP TOOL, AND I BELIEVE THAT PLANNING COMMISSIONER E-MAILED THE DIRECT LINK TO USE THAT TOOL WITH THAT YOU CAN APPLY A 30, 80, OR 300 FEET BUFFER REPRESENTING THE HEIGHT THRESHOLD FROM ANY RESIDENTIAL ZONING DISTRICT TO ANYWHERE, TO SEE WHAT THE EFFECT MIGHT BE. STAFF SUPPORTS APPROVAL OF THESE AMENDMENTS WITH THE COMMISSION. WE DO NOT SUPPORT REMOVING THE DRAFTED SUB SECTIONS IN THE INTENT STATEMENT THAT DESCRIBE THE AREAS MEETING THE GENERAL INTENTS AND SPECIFIC PURPOSE OF THE TC1 DISTRIBUTE DISTRIBUTION THOSE DESCRIPTIONS COULD BE MORE GENERALIZED BUT WE BELIEVE THAT OFFERING CONCRETE EXAMPLES OF THE AREAS INTENDED FOR TC1 SERVES TWO PURPOSES.  IT'S A WAY TO DIRECT AND SUPPORT EITHER CITY INITIATED OR OWNER INITIATED REZONING OF THESE AREAS, AND IT ALSO DESCRIBES BY IDENTIFYING THOSE AREAS THE EXISTING CONDITIONS AND PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS THAT ARE PROPERTY APPROPRIATE IF REZONING TC1 IN A WAY THAT WORDS A LONG WE DON'T HAVE ROOM FOR THAT MANY WORDS. STAFF, PLANNING COMMISSION, WE CAN ANALYZE, PLANNING COMMISSION CAN MAKE A RECOMMENDATION, CITY COUNCIL CAN APPROVE ANOTHER REZONING EDITION BETTER BY COMPARING THAT PETITION AND ITS CHARACTERISTICS AND SO FORTH WITH THESE KNOWN AREAS THAT WE'VE ALREADY SCRIBED. DESCRIBED. LAND OWNERS CAN DO MUCH SIMILAR ACCOMPLISH A SIMILAR THING. THEY CAN â€” WHETHER THE TC1 DISTRICT WOULD BE A GOOD FIT BY KNOWING WHAT IS ALREADY BEEN DEEMED APPROPRIATE. GENERALLY CODE LANGUAGE STRIVES TO BE CLEAR TO THE POINT AND USEFUL, AND WE BELIEVE THAT KEEPING THAT SUB SECTION WOULD DO THAT. ON SLIDE, NOW FOR A LITTLE BIT OF ADDITIONAL BACKGROUND THAT CAME, THAT WAS REQUESTED FROM THE LAST MEETING, SLIDE 7 SHOWS THE IDENTIFIED TARGET AREA OF THE SOUTH STATE EISENHOWER AREA, EXEC LA AS DISCUSSED LAST WEEK. I'VE GONE THROUGH OR MASTER PLAN AGAIN AND THE GRAY BOX IDENTIFIES WHERE SOUTH STATE STREET AND EISENHOWER ARE SPECIFICALLY MENTIONED IN OUR LIBRARY OF PLANNING DOCUMENTS. AS A LITTLE BIT OF A SIDE NOTE, OUR MASTER PLAN IS A COLLECTION OF EIGHT ELEMENTS THAT MAKE IN THE MASTER PLAN. THE ELEMENTS INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO A LAND USE ELEMENT, TRANSPORTATION PLAN, NON-MOTORIZED TRANSPORTATION PLAN, A PARKS AND OPEN SPACE PLAN, A NATURAL FEATURES PLAN. SO THE LAND USE ELEMENT, THE SOUTH STATE STREET CORRIDOR ELEMENTS AND THE BRIARWOOD SUB AREA RESOURCE DOCUMENT TALK ABOUT THIS AREA IN PARTICULAR. FOR THE SOUTH STATE STREET EISENHOWER AREA THE MASTER PLAN ELEMENTS COLLECTIVELY SUPPORTURE REZONING AND UPZONING AND SUPPORT THE DESIGN STANDARDS WE'VE PUT FORTH IN THE ORDINANCE. THE BOUNDARIES THAT STAFF HAVE SUGGESTED THAT MEET THE INTENT OF THE TC1 DISTRICT GENERALLY CORRESPOND TO THE SOUTH STATE STREET AREA 2 AND 3 AND THIS BRIER TWO SUB AREA PLAN ALSO HAS A GEOGRAPHY ASSOCIATED WITH IT AND THAT SUB AREA OVERLAPS WITH THE SOUTH STATE STREETCAR DO AREA - - STATE STREET CORRIDOR AREA TOO. THEY CONFLICT BUT GEO GRAPHICALLY THEY OVERLAP. SLIDE 9 IS THE WASHTENAW AVENUE AREA WE HAVE IDENTIFIED AS APPROPRIATE FOR THE TC1 DISTRICT. THE MASTER PLAN REVIEW Y'LL EHE. THE NON-MOTORIZED TRANSPORTATION PLAN ELEMENT AND THE NORTHEAST AREA TRANSPORTATION PLAN RESOURCE DOCUMENT. WHAT THOSE COLLECTIVELY SAY IS REZONING OR UPZONING IS SUPPORTED IN THE DESIGN STANDARDS THAT WE'RE PUTTING FORTH ARE SUPPORTED AND THE BOUNDARIES ON THE MAP CORRESPOND TO THE BOUNDARIES, TO THE LINEAR BOUNDARY OF THE IDENTIFIED AND REIMAGINED WASHTENAW DOCUMENT. THAT DOCUMENT DOESN'T SPEAK TO DEPTH BUT THAT DOCUMENT DOES TALK ABOUT THE WASHTENAW CORRIDOR BEING BETWEEN 23 AND PLATT ROAD. IT PROVIDES NO GUIDANCE ON HOW DEEP SO WE HAVE STAFF HAVE PUT FORTH THE PREVIOUS SLIDE AND MAP ABOUT WHAT THE DEPTH OF THIS ZONING DISTRICT WILL BE APPROPRIATE. AND SUGGESTION OF WHERE THE TC1 DISTRICT WILL BE APPROPRIATE. SLIDE 12 IDENTIFIES WHAT MASTER PLAN ELEMENTS ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE - - IT'S JUST THE LAND USE ELEMENT. THE BOUNDARIES OF THE PROPOSED TC1 DISTRICT GENERALLY CORRESPOND TO THREE - - TO ONE FULL AND TWO PARTIAL AREAS THAT ARE IDENTIFIED IN THE LAND USE ELEMENT IN THE LAND USE ELEMENT THEY'RE CALLED THE LIBERTY STADIUM COMMERCIAL DISTRICT AND A LITTLE BIT OF THE SHOPPING CENTER DISTRICT AND THE STADIUM NEIGHBORHOOD. FINALLY HERE IS THE BOUNDARIES OF THE PLYMOUTH ROAD CORRIDOR TRANSIT CORRIDOR. STAFF HAS SUGGESTED THAT IT IS THE COMMERCIAL OR MIXED USE ZONING DISTRICTS BETWEEN 23 AND TRAVERWOOD DRIVE. THERE ARE FOUR COMPONENTS OF THE PASTOR PLAN THAT CONTAIN SOME SORT OF SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS OF PLYMOUTH ROAD. THEY ARE THE LAND USE ELEMENT TRANSPORTATION PLAN ELEMENT. NONE OF THOSE PROVIDE ANY GEOGRAPHICAL RECOMMENDATION REGARDING WHAT MIGHT BE THE PLYMOUTH ROAD CORRIDOR. CORRESPONDS TO THE UNDERLYING MIXED USE OR SPECIAL PURPOSE ZONING DISTRICTS. FINALLY MY LAST SLIDE, SLIDE 15, IS JUST SIMPLY A ZONING MAP THAT IS NOW TOO FAR ZOOMED OUT TO HAVE LABELS ON IT BUT THE GREEN IS PUBLIC LAB WHICH INCLUDES PL, THE GREEN IS PL FOR PUBLIC LAND, WHICH INCLUDES LAND OWNED BY THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN. YELLOW TONES ARE GENERALLY RESIDENTIAL.  RED TONES ARE COMMERCIAL AND BLUE AND TURN TONES ARE OFFICE OR RESEARCH OR INDUSTRIAL. U.S. 23 HERE IS HERE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE SCREEN MOVE WEST AND OVER HERE IN THIS AREA, AND I THINK I HAVE A POWERPOINT POINTER. AND HERE IS THE PLYMOUTH COMMERCIAL NODE. AS YOU CAN SEE THERE'S A LOT OF PUBLIC LAND ON THE CORRIDOR AND A LOT OF RESIDENTIAL JUST BEHIND. OUR STAFF RECOMMENDATION IS APPROVAL AND WE RECOMMEND THAT ONE SECTION BE ADDED BACK INTO THE ORDINANCE IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I WON'T GO OVER PREVIOUS SLIDES BUT THEY ARE AT THE THE THE READY IF NEEDED AND THEY CAN BE CALLED UP. I WILL CEDE TIME TO PLANNING MANAGER BRETT LEONARD, I KNOW HE WANTED TO SPEAK AS WELL REGARDING OUR POTENTIAL RESOLUTION.
01:13:06.007: >> THANK YOU. THANK YOU, ALEXIS, AND TO THE COMMISSION. I WANTED TO JUST WE TOP TOUCHED ON THIS AT THE PREVIOUS DISCUSSION ON APRIL 6 BUT I HAVE PROVIDED THE COMMISSION HAS MOVED TO STRIKE THOSE OUT OF THE INTENT SECTION.  SO I JUST WANTED TO PROVIDE AN ALTERNATIVE METHOD FOR THE PLANNING COMMISSION TO STILL FOLLOW-UP ON THE CITY COUNCIL DIRECTION. JUST AS A REMINDER, THE CITY COUNCIL HAS ASKED THE PLANNING COMMISSION FOR TWO THINGS. ONE IS TO PROPOSE A NEW TRANSIT CORRIDOR ZONING ORDINANCE THAT CONSIDERS A VARIETY OF FACTORS. THIS ORDINANCE INCORPORATES SEVERAL OF THOSE FACTORS, NOT ALL, BUT WE'VE HAD DISCUSSION ABOUT ALL OF THOSE. AND THEN IT ALSO ADDITIONALLY SUGGESTS REQUESTS THAT YOU RECOMMEND GEOGRAPHIES WHERE THIS DISTRICT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE. IF THE COMMISSION MAINTAINS STRIKING VOTES SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHIES OUT OF THE INTENT SECTION WHICH IF THEY WERE INCLUDED I THINK IT ACCOMPLISHES THAT, SHARED WITH YOU VIA E-MAIL OR A LITTLE BIT EARLIER THIS AFTERNOON, A SIMPLE PROPOSED RESOLUTION THAT WOULD STILL PROVIDE THAT FEEDBACK TO THE CITY COUNCIL ALL BE IT NOT EMBEDDED DIRECTLY INTO THE ORDINANCE. THE MOTION SIMPLY AS VENT PRESENTED TO YOU WOULD SAY THE FOLLOWING GEOGRAPHY WILL BE PRIORITIZED FOR CITY INITIATED ZONING TO TC1 TRANSIT ZONING AND INTENDS TO INCORPORATE INTO THE COMMISSION'S WORK PLAN.  THE FIRST PRIORITY WOULD BE SOUTH STATE FROM OAK BROOK TO I94 AND EISENHOWER PARKWAY FROM MAIN TO THE RAIL ROAD TRACKS.  THE SECOND PRIORITY WOULD BE WASHTENAW FROM PLATT ROAD TO US23. THE THIRD FROM WEST STADIUM FROM MAPLE TO PAULINE AND MAPLE TO LIBERTY, AND FOURTH PLYMOUTH FROM MERVYN TO U.S. 23.  I'VE ALWAYS INCLUDED BUT NOT IN THE PROPOSED MOTION. CONSISTENT WITH THE PATTERNS WE ARE SEEING IN THE MASTER PLAN LANGUAGE IS SORT OF MORE SPECIFIC THEN I HAVE SEPARATED OUT SOUTH INDUSTRIAL TO THE SOUTH WHICH IS EXCLUSIVELY MANUFACTURING ZONING. THEN PACKARD FROM STADIUM TO STONE SCHOOL THAT IS THAT PORTION OF PACKARD THAT HAS MIXED JOINING DISTRICTS THAT MIGHT BE APPLICABLE TO THIS PLANNING DISTRICT AND THEN AN ADDITIONAL SEGMENTS OF PACKARD FROM SPRING BROOK TO FERNWOOD WHICH IS LARGELY THE COMMERCIAL CORRIDOR NEAR PLATT AND PACKARD. AND THEN FINALLY MAIN STREET NORTH FROM EISENHOWER TO ANN ARBOR. THOSE ARE SOME OF THE OTHER CORRIDORS THAT HAVE COME UP.
01:16:31.012: >> VERY GOOD. NOW WE'LL OPEN THE PUBLIC HEARING. THIS IS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR PERSONS TO SPEAK FOR UP TO THREE MINUTES ABOUT THE PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO THE UDC TO ESTABLISH A NEW TRANSIT CORRIDOR ZONING DISTRICT. IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK ON THIS ITEM PLEASE INDICATE BY SAYING SO BY PRESSING STAR 9 ON YOUR PHONE TO RAISE YOUR HAND. CITY STAFF WILL CALL ON CALLERS THAT HAVE RAISED THEIR HAND. AS USUAL PLEASE MUTE ANY BACKGROUND SOUNDS STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS AT THE BEGINNING OF YOUR COMMENT.
01:17:09.917: >> CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 010. UNMUTE YOUR PHONE EXPO DRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
01:17:26.601: >> CAN EVERYONE HEAR ME?
01:17:27.468: >> WE CAN GO AHEAD.
01:17:28.736: >> MY NAME IS ANDREW AND I LIVE AT 201 SOUTH FIRST. I'M INTHE INVESTMENT DIRECTOR AT OXFORD COMPANIES AND â€” I'M IN SUPPORT OF THE PROSE POSED TC BUN - - . A â€” PROPOSED TC1 DISTRICT. CONSTRUCTION COSTS ARE RISING RAPIDLY DUE TO INCREASES IN MATERIAL AND LABOR COSTS AT OXFORD WE'RE EAGER TO INVEST THE TC1 DISTRICT ON SOUTH STATE HOWEVER WE'RE HAVING DIFFICULTY FORMULATING A PROJECT THAT IS ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE SID AFTER GREATER HEIGHT LIMIT AT LEAST IN THE STATE STREET CORRIDOR OF 25. THE PROSE PROPOSAL POSED HEIGHT RESTRICTION LIMITS BUILDING TO ABOUT 9 STORIES IN COMPARISON 77 EISENHOWER IS 10 STORIES SO THE TC1 DISTRICT AS PROPOSED IS A STEP BACKWARDS. BY INCREASING THE HEIGHT LIMIT THIS WILL HELP US ADD MORE UNITS. ADDITIONALLY THERE ARE FEW NEIGHBORS IN THE SOUTH SIDE NEIGHBOR SO A HIGH â€” A HEIGHT OF 250 FEET WILL HELP ENCOURAGE MORE DENSITY WHICH WILL INCENTIVIZE MORE INVESTMENT AND CONTRIBUTE TO WALKABILITY AND AFFORDABILITY. THANKS.
01:18:51.519: >> WOULD ANYONE ELSE LIKE TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENT DURING THE PUBLIC HEARING FOR THE TC1 DISTRICT? IF SO YOU CAN INDICATE THAT BY PRESSING STAR 9 ON YOUR TELEPHONE.
01:19:06.400: >> I'D ALSO LIKE TO NOTE THAT I HAVE COMMISSIONER LEE HAS RECUSED HIMSELF FROM CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL HE HAS BEEN MOVED INTO AN ATTENDEE SO HE IS NOT PARTICIPATING.
01:19:21.248: >> THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE FOR THE PUBLIC HEAR HEARING, TAR 9 IF YOU'D LIKE TO PROVIDE A COMMENT. SEEING NONE I WILL READ THE MOTION AND WE CAN HAVE DISCUSSION. THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION HERE STANDBY RECOMMENDS THE MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL AAPPROVE AMENDMENTS TO THE UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE TO CREATE A NEW ZONING DISTRICT NAMED TC1, TRANSIT CORRIDOR BECAUSE CREATING A DISTRICT AND THE PROPOSED PERMITTED USES, USA-SPECIFIC STANDARDS AND DIMENSIONAL STANDARDS ARE RECOMMENDED BY NUMEROUS GOALS AND ACTIONS OF THE CITY MASTER PLAN FOR INCREASING DENSITY ALONG TRANSIT CORRIDORS.  MOVED BY COMMISSIONER SAUVE, SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER MILLSTEIN.  WHO WANTS TO START OFF DISCUSSION? COMMISSION â€” COMMISSIONER DISCH.
01:20:32.019: >> COMMISSIONER DISCH:  SO I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS BASED ON THE COMMUNICATIONS THAT WE RECEIVED TONIGHT. RAE INT OUT A CONTRADICONED TO THAT OUR WAREHOUSE AND REC REPAIR SITES CREATED WITH HALF OF THE FIRST SENT SENTENCE IN THE GENERAL INTENT STATEMENT. THE GENERAL INTENT STATEMENT - - WHERE IS IT?  OVER HERE. DISTRICT INTENDED ALONG ONE EXISTING TRANSIT CORRIDORS WITH REGULAR FIXED SERVICES PROVIDED BOY THE ANN ARBOR AREA TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY: ON ESTABLISHED COMMERCIAL AND OFFICE SITES OFTEN WITH DEEP FRONT SET BACKS VAST SERVICE PARKING LOTS AND LOWER AREA FLOOR RATIOS. WE ARE, IT IS NO LONGER LIMITED TO ESTABLISH COMMERCIAL AND OFFICE SITES BUT WE HAVE NOW EXTENDED IT TO HOTEL WHERE WAS THAT LIST THAT I READ HOTEL RESEARCH HOUSE AND VEHICLE REPAIR SITES. DO WE NEED TO ADDRESS THAT FIRST SO THAT THERE IS NO CONFUSION?
01:22:08.616: >> I DON'T BELIEVE THAT IT IS IMPERATIVE CONSIDERED COMMERCIAL USE THEY ARE NOT CONSIDERED RESIDENTIAL. HOWEVER, ON THE OTHER HAND, OBVIOUSLY THE SENTENCE CAN BE REVISED.
01:22:26.000: >> WHAT ABOUT INSERTING THE WORD PRIMARILY BETWEEN AUTHORITY AND ON?
01:22:34.041: >> I AM HAPPY TO, I DON'T KNOW HOW FORMAL WE WOULD LIKE TO BE. I'M HAPPY TO MAKE THAT CHANGE BEFORE THE COMMISSION IS IF THAT IS WHAT THE COMMISSION LIKES.
01:22:43.584: >> DOES ANYONE ELSE FEEL LIKE THAT'S GOOD IDEA, OR JUST NOT NECESSARY?
01:22:53.861: >> COMMISSIONER.
01:23:18.986: >> I WOULD FEEL MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE WITH SAYING THEY OUGHT TO BE PRIMARILY OF AN OFFICE OR COMMERCIAL ESTABLISHED OFFICE COMMERCIAL THAN JUST IN TRANSIT CORRIDORS BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE THERE'S A LOT, LIKE, THERE'S WAY MORE TRANSIT CORRIDORS IN THE CITY THAN WHAT WE HAVE GIVEN FAIR SHIFT TO THINKING THROUGH.
01:23:41.642: >> IT DOESN'T SAY EXCLUSIVELY, SO WE COULD LEAVE IT OR PUT IN PRIMARILY TO SUGGEST THIS IS NOT EXCLUSIVE.
01:24:04.665: >> PRIMARILY GOING TO GO?
01:24:07.835: >> BETWEEN AUTHORITY AND ON. SO ATA PRIMARILY ON ESTABLISHED COMMERCIAL AND OFFICE SITES.
01:24:19.346: >> YOU'RE STILL THINKING ABOUT IT?  DO YOU WANT TO HEAR FROM MR. LEN -RT NONE IT'S UNRELATED TO THAT, I JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT FOR THE COMMISSION AND I'VE RECEIVED ONE NOTE THERE WAS A DELAY IN THE SYSTEM FOR FOLKS DURING THAT LAST PUBLIC HEARING TO BE ABLE TO PRESS STAR 9 IT WASN'T RESPONDING. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO OPEN UP THAT OPPORTUNITY AGAIN OR CONTINUE WITH DISCUSSON. I SORT OF ANTICIPATED HAVING MORE PEOPLE THAT WE WOULD, WE MIGHT HAVE MORE PEOPLE, UM, CALL IN SO I'M WILLING TO OPEN IT UP IF OTHERS... UNLESS, YES, I SEE THUMBS UP. SO, UM, LET'S PUT THIS ON PAUSE FOR JUST A MINUTE. SINCE OUR DISCUSSION JUST STARTED WE'LL REOPEN THE PUBLIC HEARING AND MR. LENNERT, THANK YOU FOR LETTING US KNOW AND IF YOU CAN KINDLY PERMIT FOLKS TO RAISE THEIRLAND.
01:25:18.672: >> THIS IS A REMINDER FOR OTHERS INTERESTED IN SPEAKING AND HAVEN'T ADDRESSED THE PLANNING COMMISSION DURING THE PUBLIC HEARING O THAN TC1 PROPOSED - - ON THE TC1 PROPOSED PLANNING DISTRICT, PRESS STAR 9 IF YOU'D LIKE TO ADDRESS THE COMMISSION. CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 955. YOU CAN PRESS STAR 6 TO UNMUTE YOUR PHONE AND ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
01:25:49.503: >> HI, EVERYBODY, THANKS FOR REOPENING THE HEARING I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED THERE. YOU'D THINK I HAVE ENOUGH PRACTICE DOING IT BY NOW. ANYWAY. I APPRECIATE THE CHANGES THAT WERE IN PROCESS REFERRING TO THE CORRIDOR HOWEVER I WONDER HOW PEOPLE FEEL ABOUT THE RED LINES ON THE MAPS KIND OF OVERRIDING THAT PROXIMATE LANGUAGE. IF YOU HAVE TO HAVE THOSE PARCELS DELINEATED. I WONDER WHAT IMPACT IT WILL HAVE ON PARCELS JUST OUTSIDE THAT RED LINE. I THINK IT'S A GREAT CHANGE TO HAVE JUST THE VERY SMALL AREAS IN YOUR CORNERS RESERVED FOR BUILDINGS THAT WILL HAVE AMENITIES FOR THE DENSITY THAT WILL EVENTUALLY COME. I WONDER IF THE SETBACK MIGHT BE INCREASED TO 15 FEET FOR MIXED USE JUST BECAUSE I PICTURE PLACES THAT WANT TO HAVE DINING SIDE WALK DIBBING ON PLYMOUTH ROAD LIKE THAT STARBUCKS ON NIXON ROAD. SMALLER QUESTIONS ABOUT PARKING STRUCTURES BOWING CALCULATED ON A SQUARE FOOT BASIS LOOKING AT MAXIMUM AREA ALLOWED OR JUST BY A PLANNED VIEW FOOT PRINT. I GUESS I WOULD ECHO THE CALLER THAT ASKED FOR GREATER DENSITY, GREATER HEIGHT ALLOWANCE IF YOU'RE 300 FEET AWAY FROM RESIDENTIAL, CERTAINLY NOT UNLIMITED. WE KNOW HOW THAT WENT OVER ON THE COMMUNITY BUT IT SEEMS LIKE 150 FEET WOULD BE A GREAT EXTENSION IF THAT'S WHAT SEEMS FEASIBLE TO THE DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY. THE LENGTHEN ORG THE CORRIDORS IS GREAT I STILL QUESTION WHY LOWER TOWN ISN'T INCLUDED. OR STATE GOING TO STIMPSON. I START TO WONDER WHAT AREAS ARE NOT APPLICABLE TO THIS I THINK SUGGESTIONS IN A MEMO TO COUNCIL COULD BE A NICE WAY TO NOT HAVE IT IN THE ORDINANCE ITSELF.
01:28:41.341: >> 30 MORE SECOND.
01:28:42.175: >> I ENCOURAGE YOU TO PERHAPS NAME STREETS, PACKARD ROAD, SOUTH MAIN, ANN ARBOR STREET, BROADWAY STREET, COMMERCIAL OR NON-RESIDENTIAL AREAS ON WITHOUT DELINEATING A START AND END PLACE. IF THERE'S A RATIONALE LIKE SOME COMMERCIAL AREAS OF THOSE I'D APPRECIATE ITEM THOUGHTS ON THAT. THANKS SO MUCH.
01:29:07.234: >> THANK YOU. TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES WHICH WE ALWAYS APOLOGIZE FOR AHEAD OF TIME. DURING THE ZOOM MEETINGS.  IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WANTS TO TO ADDRESS US ON THIS ITEM?
01:29:24.284: >> STAR 9 TO RAISE YOUR HAND.
01:29:28.121: >> THANK YOU FOR REITERATING THAT.
01:29:33.193: >> I THINK YOU'VE MENTIONED IT ONCE OR TWICE.
01:29:35.262: >> IN THE TIME JUST IN CASE THERE'S A DELAY ALTHOUGH WE CAN'T BLAME THE TV DELAY.
01:29:40.167: >> I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER INDICATIONS.
01:29:42.035: >> KAY, GATE. SO WE'LL GO BACK TO THE DISCUSSION OF THE GENERAL INTENT STATEMENT PARAGRAPH A EFFECTIVELY. WHAT COMMISSIONER DISH WAS SUGGESTING WAS IN ADDITION OF A WORD PRIMARILY, WE NOW HAVE IT BEFORE US SO WE CAN LOOK AT IT MORE EASILY TOGETHER.  THOUGHTS?
01:30:37.224: >> LET'S LET STAFF CAPTURE THEM TOGETHER AND THEN WE CAN MAYBE IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT'S GOING TO THAT PEOPLE ARE NOT HAPPY WITH LET'S CHIME IN. AND WE'LL DISCUSS IT AS IT GOES RATHER THAN ALL THE MOTIONS UNFOLDING AND ALL OF THAT. COMMISSIONER DISCH.
01:30:55.042: >> OPINION:  THE OTHER THING I WANTED TO RAISE FROM THE COMMUNICATIONS THAT WE RECEIVED TONIGHT WAS THE TWO STORY MINIMUM IN THE CASE OF MOVIE THEATERS PLANT NURSERIES THAT MIGHT WANT TO EXPAND BY BUILDING INTO THEIR PARKING LOTS AND WE ALWAYS LOVE LESS PARKING LOT AND MORE ACTIVE USE. MOREOVER I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE TWO-STORY MINIMUM DISCOURAGING NEW SMALL GROCERY STORES, EVEN DRUG STORES.  WE LIKE TO HAVE THESE ON TRANSITS CORRIDORS FOR OUR 20-MINUTE NEIGHBORHOOD GOAL. SO IT WOULDN'T BE THIS WOULDN'T BE A CONCERN OF ALL OF OUR AREAS, BUT IT WOULD BE A CONCERN IN THE MOST MORE, IN THE... WELL CONCERNING A, SAY, ON PACKARD. IT MIGHT BE BE A CONCERN ON WEST STADIUM. OBVIOUSLY NOT ON STATE AND EISENHOWER BECAUSE THERE WE'RE GOING TO GET TALLER STUFF.  I'M JUST, HAD STAFF CONSIDERED THAT, AND WHAT IS YOUR RESPONSE TO THIS CUBSON RAISED?  â€” CONCERN RAISED.
01:32:14.187: >> WE ARE NOT PROPOSING THAT PACKARD BE CONSIDERED RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE, FOR THOSE REASONS, WE HAVE SAID THAT WE HAVE FOCUSED ON THESE AREAS WHERE TWO-STORY MINIMUM IS DEFINITELY APPROPRIATE, AND THEN MAYBE THAT'S ANOTHER REASON WHY THE NEXT ITERATION IS TC2 FOR, FOR AREAS WITH MUCH SMALLER NARROWER, SHALLOWER LOTS. ANSOME DISCUSSIONS EARLIER DAY AND LOOKING AT THENTECITY AE SAME TESTS TO PACKARD. IT MIGHT BE THAT PACKARD DOESN'T MAYBE NEED TO BE REZONED, BUT MAYBE PACKARD NEEDSS A SPECIAL PARKING DISTRICT TO HELP WITH PARKING REQUIREMENTS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. THAT WOULD BE THE RESPONSE. IT'S A VERY VALID COMMENT AND THAT SORT OF ACTUALLY SPEAKS TO RATHER THAN AMENDING TC1, THAT SPEAKS TO THAT PACKARD IS NOT FULLY ANALYZED AND MAYBE IS NOT APROPE FOR THE TC1.
01:33:35.602: >> MR. LEN -RT:  I WOULD ADD THAT I DON'T... I THINK PART OF THE BALANCE IS SINGLE STORY COMMERCIAL SOMEWHAT SINGULAR PURPOSE BUILDINGS ARE WHAT WE GET NOW. BOTH BUILDINGS I THINK IT'S A GOOD QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT WE WANT TO - - PART OF THE INTENTION OF THE DISTRICT WAS TO CHANGE THE TYPOLOGY OF THE DEVELOPMENT HAPPENING ON THESE CORRIDORS INTO SOMETHING THAT HAS MORE UTILITY, MORE LIFE IN DIFFERENT WAYS OVER THE LONG-TERM. WE. I DON'T KNOW THAT THIS WOULD, FOR EXAMPLE, A TWO-STORY MINIMUM IS ADDED, THAT MIGHT ADD TO A BARRIER TO THOSE USES BEING REALIZED IN THE FUTURE ALONG THESE CORRIDORS.  I THINK PART OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS IS REACTING TO THAT PROTOTYPE THAT'S HAPPENING NOW. THERE'S NOTHING TO STOP THE GROCERY STORE FROM BEING CONSTRUCTED ON THESE CORRIDORS OVER THE LAST 20 TO 30 YEARS. THIS IS, YOU KNOW, I WANT TO BE HONEST, IF THAT TWO-STORY REQUIREMENT IS THERE, IT LIMITS THAT POSSIBLEIBILITY GOING FORWARD. - - IT LIMITS THAT POSSIBILITY GOING FORWARD. I DON'T KNOW THAT I HAVE A LOT OF MARKET EXPECTATION FOR THAT USE TO HAPPEN, AND PART OF THIS IS SHOULD THE FORM OF BUILDINGS ALONG THESE CORRIDORS LOOK DIFFERENT THAN THOSE GROCERY STORES SO THAT WHEN THOSE USES CHANGE, 10 OR 20 YEARS FROM NOW, THEY MIGHT HAVE MORE UTILITY FROM WHEN THE GROCERY STORE CLOSED. SO IT'S A BALANCE.
01:35:22.442: >> THAT, I WANT TO JUMP IN HERE BECAUSE HEIGHT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WAS THINKING ABOUT TOO AND I WANT TO, I NEEDED TO DOUBLE CHECK TO MAKE SURE. FOR THE VERY DEEP LOTS THAT ARE... IT'S STILL IN THE ORDINANCE THAT IF IT'S MORE THAN 750 FEET FROM THE CORRIDOR YOU CAN STILL HAVE A ONE-STORY BUILDING. THAT'S WHAT I'M SEEING IN THAT TABLE; RIGHT? SO THE IDEA THAT IF I DON'T KNOW, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE. WHAT IS THE ONE ON THE WEST SIDE?
01:35:56.977: >> MAPLE VILLAGE.
01:35:57.777: >> MAPLE VILLAGE, RIGHT? LIKE, SOME OF THOSE BACK BUILDINGS OR MAYBE PART OF ARBORLAND CAN STAY AND THINGS GET DEVELOPED IN THE FRONT. I CAN'T THINK OF HOW MANY LOTS WE HAVE I WAS PULLING OP MAP, 750-FOOT DEEP, BUT THAT'S STILL IN THERE; RIGHT? SO THE KROGER COULD STAY. OPINION COMMISSIONER DISCH SO COULD THE PLUM ON PLYMOUTH STAY I THINK IT'S CLOSER TO 750 FEET.
01:36:54.601: >> LIKE RIGHT ON...
01:36:55.869: >> AND IT'S SUPER NICE TO HAVE THAT PLUM THERE.
01:37:05.278: >> PART OF THE EFFORT IS WE ARE RECOGNIZING AND WE ARE SAYING IT IS NO LONGER ACCEPT TOOL BUILD ONE STORY.  OUR LAND IS TOO VALUABLE AND OUR MIXED USE NEEDS ARE TOO GREAT. IF THE ONLY WAY THAT A ONE-STORY BUILDING IS GOING TO WORK THEN THEY PERHAPS NEED TO LOOK AT SOME PLACE THAT IS NOT ZONED TC1. I'M NOT SAYING THAT THE USES THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ARE NOT VALUABLE, BUT THERE ARE CITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY THAT HAVE FOUND A WAY TO HAVE PHARMACIES, GROCERIES, SO FORTH, AND ONE STORY BUILDINGS. I'M SORRY, IN MOMENTFUL STORY BUILDINGS. IN MULTIPLE STORY BUILDINGS. NOTHING THAT IS EXISTING TODAY WILL BE TORN DOWN BY THE CITY SO IF IT IS CURRENTLY VIABLE AND SELF SUSTAINING AND VALUABLE, I IMAGINE IT WILL STAY FOR A GOOD, LONG TIME.  THIS IS ACTIVELY SENDING A SIGNAL BECAUSE WE ARE CHOOSING BY ADOPTING THIS, CHOOSING TO SEND THE SIGNAL HENCE FORTH ONE-STORY BUILDINGS ARE NOT APPROPRIATE IN THESE SPECIFIC AREAS WHICH AGAIN SORT OF SPEAKS TO PERHAPS IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE, AS JEFF HAS SAID, TO BLANKETLY REZONE THE WHOLE CITY, AND SO WE'RE NOT PROPOSING THAT. BUT WE ARE SAYING IN THESE CHUNKS, THE TRANSITED IS THERE AND OUR OTHER NEEDS ARE SO GREAT THAT IN92 PROTOTYPE MUST BE â€” THE NEW PROTOTYPE MUST BE. THE ZONING ALLOWS 2 TWO HUNDRED PERCENT FAR, OR 300 PERCENT FAR, BUT WHAT WE'RE GETTING IS 40 PERCENT FAR WITH ONE-STORY BUILDINGS SET BACK 900 FEET AND A THOUSAND PARKING SPACES IN FRONT. SO WE'RE SAYING THAT HENCEFORTH THAT SHALL NOT BE SO.  TRUNK ARE. YOU CAN POINT TO OTHER CITIES WHERE THEY'RE GETTING THE LAND USES THAT WE DESIRE AND BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GETTING THEM VOLUNTARILY, WE ARE RAISING OUR MINIMUM STANDARDS.
01:39:30.657: >> YEP, ALL OF THAT MAKES TOTAL SENSE TO ME AND JUST TRYING TO MAKE A PRACTICAL POINT WHICH IS THAT ONE OF THE BIGGEST COMPLAINTS THAT I HEAR FROM PEOPLE IN WARD ONE IS THAT THEY HAVE TO GET INTO A CAR TO GROW GROCER SHOPPING AND ONE OF THE THINGS ABOUT PLYMOUTH ROAD IS THAT IT IS THE ONE PLACE WHERE YOU SEE ENORMOUS NUMBERS OF STUDENTS NOT AT PLUM BUT AT KROGER WHERE YOU CAN TAKE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION TO DO GROCERY SHOPPING.  SO WHEN WE HAVE BRAIL BOUGHTFUL MIXED USE RESIDENTIAL BUILDING AT STATE AND EISENHOWER AND THERE'S NO PLACE FOR PEOPLE TO SHOP, I DON'T THINK THAT WE'RE FULLY REALIZING THE PICTURE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO CREATE HERE WHICH IS TO GET PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR CARS BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO GO DRIVE TO GO GROCERY SHOPPING WE ARE CREATING A CONFLICT WITH OUR GOALS. I KNOW THERE ARE TWO-STORY GROCERY STORES BUT I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY HERE.  I SEE THEM IN CHICAGO ALL THE TIME. AND I'M SURE THOSE ARE MORE EXPENSIVE TO BUILD BUT I'M JUST TRYING TO THINK PRACTICALLY HERE LIKE WHERE WHERE PEOPLE GOING TO MEET THEIR BASIC NEEDS?
01:40:58.011: >> COMMISSIONER SAUVE.
01:41:02.015: >> IN THIS CONVERSATION TARGET IS SHOWING UP DOWNTOWN IN A SMALLER PRINT FOR THOSE NEEDS AND TO KIND OF, ON THE COMMENT OF CHICAGO TIGHTER BUT INTENTIONALLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TIGHTER STANDARDS FOR MORE COMPACT SPACES. ON STATE AND EISENHOWER A GROCERY STORE ON THE GROUND FLOOR OF THE APPROPRIATE SIZE TO THE ANCHOR TENANT WITH RESIDENTIAL ABOVE. TRYING TO INCENTIVIZE. WE'RE NOT SAYING HOUSING NOW, AND WHAT THIS POLICY REALLY IS TRYING TO DO IS CONVERGE BOTH OF THOSE ESPECIALLY WITH THE ADDITION OF RETAIL AT INTERSECTIONS. TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S A CONVERGE, OF BOTH OF THOSE AND NOT ISOLATION OF EITHER AMONG ALL OF THESE. I SEE IT AS A GOOD THING THAT WE ARE MAKING IT HARDER. I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF INCENTIVE AND DEVELOPMENT HERE FOR CHEAP LAND AND CHEAPER BUILDINGS AND WE NEED TO THINK SMARTER ABOUT THE GROWING NEED FOR SUSTAINABILITY AND HOUSING CRISIS WHICH MEANS PUTTING PEOPLE CLOSER. I'M OKAY WITH MAKING IT. IT'S A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO START BECAUSE WE HAVE TO CHANGE HABITS. IT'S HARD TO CHANGE HABITS BUT WE BECOME A BETTER CITY FOR IT. THAT'S MY STANCE.
01:42:43.549: >> COMMISSIONER DISCH, ANYTHING ELSE ON YOUR LIST YOU WANTED TO TALK ABOUT?
01:42:57.697: >> OKAY. EVERYBODY MOVED THEN COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL RANDALL.
01:43:11.110: >> ONE QUESTION AND THEN A POTENTIAL DISCUSSION POINT. I REMEMBER BACK WHEN WE A FEW MONTHS AGO WHEN WE FIRST STARTED TALKING ABOUT THIS AND WE REMOVED THE OPEN SPACE REQUIREMENT, WHICH I THINK MAKES SENSE IN THIS CASE I'M JUST CURIOUS IF THIS DOES WHAT WE WANT IT TO DO ALONG THESE CORRIDORS AND WE STRESS OUT OUR CURRENT PUBLIC PARKS IS THERE ANY SORT OF, DOES THE CITY MONITOR PARK SPACE PER CAPITA AND THEN THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO PURCHASE LAND?  I'M SEEING NODS. I JUST WANTED TO CHECK. I GUESS MY SECOND COMMENT IS RELATED TO THAT, THOUGH AND ACTUALLY THE SETBACKS FOR LIKE PLAZAS OR DINING MAYBE 10 FEET. I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S A WAY TO, I THINK WE SAID 10 FEET FOR MIXED USE. I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S TOO COMPLICATED TO BUILD IT IF IT'S IF YOU'RE GOING TO USE IT FOR OUTDOOR DINING IT COULD BE UP TO 10 FEET TIGHT CLOSE TO THE ROAD, TO HAVE THAT KIND OF OUTDOOR SPACE ESPECIALLY NOW DURING COVID I THINK A LOT MORE RESTAURANT ESTABLISHMENTS, COFFEE SHOPS WOULD WANT THAT HRUT. I DON'T KNOW IF I'M PROPOSING ANYTHING I'M JUST CURIOUS IF PEOPLE ARE THINKING ABOUT PUSHING THAT A LITTLE BIT MAYBE WITH THE CONDITION THAT IT HAS TO BE THAT'S SOMETHING WE COULD DO.
01:44:49.509: >> I WOULD CAUTION THE COMMISSION TO THINK ABOUT IT NOT IN A USE-SPECIFIC BASE BECAUSE ARE LIMITING THE UTITY OF THATOU SPACE LONG-TERM. ONE OF THE PURPOSES IS TO CREATE FLEXIBLE SPACE THAT HAS SOME UTILITY. WE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THE CHALLENGES OF RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL. I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU NOT TO JUST TIE IT TO A USE, YOU PROVIDE THE FLEXIBILITY AND THE SETBACK SO THAT THERE ISN'T A LIMITATION THAT IF IT'S WITHIN 100 FEET OF AN INTERSECTION AND YOU CAN ONLY DO COMMUNITY AMENITIES. I THINK YO SHOULD THINK ABOUT HOW IT CAN RELATE TO THE STREET.
01:45:47.533: >> THANK YOU.  I GUESS I WOULDN'T WANT A BUNCH OF BUILDINGS SET BACK FROM THE STREET FOR NO REASON. SO I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S A WAY
01:46:00.780: >> WELCOME TO ZONING.
01:46:02.648: >> I'VE GOT AN IMMEDIATE FOLLOW-UP WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SPECIFIC CORRIDORS WE KNOW THAT SOMETIMES THE RIGHTS OF WAY ARE MUCH MORE VASTLY DIFFERENT FROM PLACE TO PLACE AND WHAT'S CURRENTLY ESTABLISHED IS NOT WHAT NEEDS. TO WE KNOW WITH ANY OF THESE PLACES IF 10 FEET WILL FEEL TIGHT GIVEN KIND OF WHAT THAT WHERE THAT IS? LIKE HOW NARROW THE RIGHT OF WAY IS THERE? AGAIN I DON'T KNOW KIND OF THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE HOW THAT WORKS I JUST KNOW THIS COMES UP. SOMETIMES 10 FEET FEELS VERY, VERY NARROW AND SOMETIMES IT DOES NOT. JUST GIVEN HOW WIDE THE ROAD IS AND.
01:46:48.961: >> I WOULD SAY MY INSTINCT IS THESE ARE CORRIDORS THAT THIS LAND, THIS DEVELOPMENT PATTERN AND THEN THE CORRESPONDING CAPITAL INVESTMENTS ALONG THEY FOCUS ON THESE CORRIDORS ARE GOING TO EVOLVE HOPEFULLY TO BE SORT OF PERFORM AT A TRANSIT AND MULTIMODAL WAY MORE SUCCESSFULLY THAN THEY ARE NOW. BUT FOR A LONG TIME ON MOST OF THE - - I THINK 10 FEET'S GOING TO FEEL PRETTY SMALL GIVEN HOW THOSE CORRIDORS FEEL AND FUNCTION TODAY. AND SO I THINK WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE, I JUST THINK THAT A 10-FOOT SET BACK ON WASHTENAW IS GOING TO FEEL QUITE DIFFERENT THAN A 10-FOOT SETBACK ON STATE STREET OR LIBERTY. SO. AGAIN, I THINK THAT IF YOU WANT TO BUILD IN MORE FLEXIBILITY THERE, I WOULDN'T MAKE IT SO SPECIFIC TO THE SORT OF INITIAL TENETS OF THAT SPACE OR SOME HOW LIMIT THE TENETS OF THOSE SPACES. I MEAN, IT MIGHT JUST BE PERFECTLY ACCEPTABLE TO RECOGNIZE THAT END AND THEY COULD BE SET BACK MORE. THAT GIVES FLEXIBILITY. AND ONE WAY IT GIVES MORE FLEXIBILITY TO THE OPTIONS FOR ADDING THOSE MODES ALONG WITHIN AN EXISTING RIGHT OF WAY, BUT IT'S ALSO GOING TO LOSE SOME OF THAT STREET PRESENCE.
01:48:22.154: >> GO AHEAD. YOUER YOU COULD DO 0 OR 10 OR 15.
01:48:34.433: >> I WOULD SAY I THINK 10 FEET IS TIGHT WITH THE SPEED OF THOSE ROADS AND ALSO WITH THE FACT THAT WE WILL BE INTRODUCING HOPEFULLY MORE PEDESTRIAN AND BIKERS INTO THIS. WHEN BUILDINGS ARE RIGHT UP CLOSE TO THE INTERSECTION THE VISIBILITY OF PEOPLE ZIPPING BY AND THINGS LIKE THAT STARTS TO BECOME PROBLEMATIC. I'LL JUST SAY THAT WHEN WE DESIGN SOUTH MAIN THAT BUILDING WAS SET SEVEN FROM FEET BACK FROM WHERE THE RIGHT RIGHT OF WAY LINE IS, SO IT'S SET BACK FURTHER FROM WHAT IS REQUIRED THERE. PEOPLE HAVE COMPLAINED OVER AND OVER AGAIN AABOUT PULLING UP NEXT TO THAT BUILDING NOT BEING ABLE TO SEE AND THAT'S A ROAD THAT IS A LOT SLOWER THAN WHAT THESE OTHER ROADS ARE. IT'S SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT, ESPECIALLY AS WE ARE, WE WANT THE STREET WALL THING, BUT THE STREET WALL THING FEELS DIFFERENT IN A WIDER ROAD AND A FASTER ROAD, TOO. I THINK THAT MAYBE  COMMISSIONER SAUVE IF YOU HAVE IDEAS AROUND THIS TOO, IN TERMS OF DIMENSIONALITY, I THINK THE SCALE OF THESE ROADS AND THE SPEED OF THESE ROADS MEANS THAT THE SETBACKS CAN BE GREATER. WE CAN JUST APPLY LIKE A D2 TO THESE AREAS BECAUSE THEY REALLY DO HAVE DIFFERENT CONDITIONS GOING ON. I THINK 15 FEET ACTUALLY MAKES SENSE IN THESE SETTINGS GIVEN THAT ALL OF THEM ARE EITHER FASTER ROADS OR WERE ORIGINALLY DESIGNED TO BE FASTER ROADS AND THE SPEED LIMIT HAS LESSENED BECAUSE OF OF THE STUFF WE KNOW, BUT IT STILL IS EXPERIENCED THAT WAY. PLYMOUTH ROAD, YOU TRY DRIVING DOWN THAT THING AT 35 MILES AN HOUR, YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ARE COMPLETELY GOING 10 MILE MILES UNDER THE SPEED LIMIT BECAUSE IT WAS DESIGNED TO BE 45, WE JUST POSTED IT AT 35. THE LANES ARE WIDE, EVERYTHING IS WAY FAR BACK. WE NEED TO PULL THINGS CLOSER IN ORDER TO HAVE THAT EXPERIENCE BE DIFFERENT BUT WE ALSO NEED TO SEE THE REALITY OF IT IS A FASTER PLACE.  YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? WE DO WANT TO START GETTING PEOPLE ON THAT ROAD AND IF THE BUILDINGS THAT ARE REALLY CLOSE ESPECIALLY A INTERSECTIONS I WORRY A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SAFETY STUFF WITH PEDESTRIANS AND BIKERS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. -RPB THAT'S MY TWO CENTS ON THAT.
01:50:55.341: >> THIS IS IMMEDIATELY ON THIS ONE BEFORE MOVING ON TO ANOTHER TOPIC?
01:50:59.011: >> YOU'RE MUTED.
01:51:00.279: >> YEAH, JUST, UM, REAL QUICK, IF THAT'S OKAY. I WAS GOING TO EXPRESS THAT I THINK HAVING THE NARROWER SETBACK IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE I THINK THAT WE RISK RECREATING PROBLEMATIC PATTERNS IF WE TRY AND ACCOMMODATE I GUESS THE CURRENT ISSUES THAT WE HAVE. SO IF WE TRY TO AND CONTINUE THIS TREND OF BUILDING THE ROADS WITH THESE WIDER SET BACKS WE'RE JUST KIND OF CREATING CREATING OUR PROBLEMS.  I LIKE THE IDEA OF HAVING A FLEXIBILITY IN THE SET BACKS BUT I SEE THEM AS BEING TWO CONTRADICTORY POINTS. HAVING A WIDER SET BACK FOR STREET SIDE LIKE DINING, ACTIVITY USES LIKE THAT, ON OBVIOUSLY REALLY BUSY ROADS, I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE IF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO WANT TO SIT OUTSIDE ON A BUSY ROAD AND HAVE A CUP OF TEA OR WHATEVER. SO HAVING THE WIDER SET BACKS I DON'T REALLY THINK MAKES MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE ON THE USE OF THOSE SPACES AND ON THE OTHER HAND COULD ACTUALLY JUST ENCOURAGE MORE SPEEDING AND THE LIGHTER ROADS LIKE THAT COULD BE CHANGED. DIFFERENT TREATMENTS CAN BE DONE, WE'LL BE MOVING TOWARDS TRYING TO CONVERT LANES, MAKE MORE CYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE, AND I THINK THAT IF WE START HAVING VERY WIDE SETBACKS WE'LL BE TAKING A STEP IN THE WRONG DIRECTION AND KIND OF ACCOMMODATING THE SAME PROBLEMS THAT WE ALREADY HAVE.
01:52:34.373: >> GOT IT. MAYBE THEY'LL PICK UP ON AND THIS IS THE WAY I ENTER MID CLASS DO THE RAISE YOUR HAND BUTTON IF YO HAVE SOMETHING THAT'S IMMEDIATELY RELEVANT. AND THEN RAISE YOUR HAND OTHERWISE IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE THE TOPIC. COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN AND COMMISSIONER SAUVE YOU WANT TO STAY ON THIS TOPIC? OKAY, LET'S DO THAT.
01:53:00.966: >> PEOPLE SAID ON PACKARD IT WAS A COMFORTABLE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE ROAD. CAN WE LOOK INTO THAT AND SEE WHAT THE SPACE WAS?  BECAUSE I REMEMBER LOOKING AT THE PLANS THINKING THAT'S REALLY NICE AND A COUPLE O OF THE RESIDENTS THERE ALSO COMMENT SAIDED ABOUT THAT. I THINK THAT WOULD BE A REALLY NICE BENCH MARK FOR US TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT NUMBER IS AND PUT THAT INTO PLAY WITH THIS.
01:53:27.760: >> THANK YOU. COMMISSIONER SAUVE.
01:53:31.463: >> YEAH, I JUST WANTED TO ADD THINKING ABOUT THE ON MAPLE AND EVEN BERNER HILLS AND RETAINING WALLS AND ACCESSIBILITY AND RAMPS IS KIND OF ONE CONDITION TO THINK BOT IF WE'RE GOING TO LOAD THOSE IN THE FRONT AND JUST SWITCH BACK RAMP FOR CERTAIN SLOPES IF WE HAVE STEEP HILLS. I ACTUALLY THINK ARBOR HILLS IS A NICE EXAMPLE OF DOING A VERY CLEAN TWO STORY BUILDING THAT HAS ONE STORY THAT INSTEAD OUR YOU WOULD HAVE A STEP TIER HAVING TO ADDRESS THAT HILL. IF WE DON'T HAVE THE DEPTH TO NEGOTIATE SOME OF THAT PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC, THAT'S KIND OF A MATHEMATICAL PUZZLE. I JUST WANT TO RAISE THAT AS A THING, PROBABLY TOWARDS THE ARGUMENT OF A LITTLE BIT DEEPER, GET A LITTLE BIT MORE ROOM FOR ENGINEERING IN THAT FLEXIBILITY. AND SORRY JUST PULLED IT UP GOING TO TRY REALLY QUICK SEE HOW FAST I COULD GET THROUGH THIS. 40 FEET ACTUALLY FROM OUTSIDE OF THE SIDE WALK TO THE FRONT OF THE BUILDING FOR A PACKARD IS THAT BUFFER LINE RIGHT NOW. THAT'S ACTUALLY RIGHT NOW. YEAH SO THAT I THINK IS MY MAIN SET BACK CONDITIONS WERE THINKING ABOUT ACCESSIBILITY TO KIND OF ADD IN AS WELL, 10-FOOT SETBACKS FROM SIDEWALK TO BUILDING SO IT'S NOT FROM RIGHT OF WAY SO ANOTHER 5 FEET, SO IT'S 15 FEET.
01:55:18.437: >> I'M HEARING A LOT.... GENERALLY, PRO POTENTIALLY INCREASING. COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT YOU STARTED US DOWN THIS PATH. BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO THE NEXT TOPIC I WONDER IF WE CAN FINISH THIS ONE.
01:55:39.691: >> THE PROJECT REFERENCE IS 10 FEET.
01:55:43.962: >> OKAY SO 10 IS COMFORTABLE, WE'RE CURRENTLY AT 10.  I HEARD PACKARD IS A SLOWER ROAD SO POTENTIALLY THAT MEANS IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT. WHAT DO PEOPLE WANT TO DO?
01:55:56.608: >> LET'S MOVE IT UP TO 15.
01:55:59.011: >> ANY OBJECTIONS TO MOVING IT SO THAT IT CAN BE RIGHT ON THE SIDEWALK, IT CAN BE ZERO, OR IT CAN BE UP TO 15, GIVING IT A LITTLE BIT MORE FLEXIBILITY.
01:56:10.856: >> JUST FOR COMPARISONS SAKE, THEIR MILLSTEINST BRINGING IT CLOSER NOW TO A 25-FOOT SETBACK. SO, UM, WE'RE STILL SETTING A HIGHER BAR FOR STREET PRESENCE.
01:56:27.573: >> AND PRESUMABLY SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE CURRENTLY BUILD BULLET ALONG THESE â€” BUILT ALONG THESE WERE BEFORE WE HAD THAT MAXIMUM SETBACK DISTANCE, THEY WERE WILL BEFORE THAT. GREAT. OTHER ISSUES, COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT, DID YOU HAVE ANYTHING ELSE ON YOUR LIST? I THINK BEFORE THAT COMMISSIONER SAUVE WAS NEXT. WAS THAT TAKEN CARE OF OR DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING ELSE?
01:56:54.333: >> THERE'S STUFF, BUT IT'..
01:56:57.736: >>HAT'S OKAY. I FEEL LE WE'RE DONE WH SETBACKS.
01:57:00.239: >> OKA
01:57:06.178: >> COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN AFTER COMMISSIONER SAUVE.
01:57:09.014: >> OKAY, WE'LL COME BACK TO YOU.
01:57:12.517: >>O HAD A COUPLE OF THINGS. ONE I'M NOT SURE THIS IS HOW IT WAS INTENDED FOR THE 100 FEET WITH COMMERCIAL AT THE INTERSECTIONS, BUT HOW I READ IT IS THAT YOU CAN'T PUT SECOND STORY APARTMENTS WITHIN A HUNDRED FEET. IS THAT TRUE? IT SAYS TOWNHOUSES APARTMENTS ARE NOT PERMITTED WITHIN 100 FEET OF THE INTERSECTION.
01:57:44.449: >> YES. SO, RIGHT, A TOWNHOUSE OR AN APARTMENT BUILDING IS NOT PERMITTED WITHIN HAD A HUNDRED FEET BECAUSE, AND SO A TOWNHOUSE OR APARTMENT BUILTING THAT'S THE ONLY USE IN THERE.  IT'S A TOWNHOUSE OR AN APARTMENT BUILDING.
01:57:58.096: >> OKAY.
01:57:58.363: >> A BUILDING, A MIXED USE BUILDING CAN BE BUILT AT THE CORNER.  THAT PORTION OF THE BUILD BUILDING, THE 100 FEET, NEEDS TO BE NON-RESIDENTIAL, BUT THE UPPER PORTION CAN BE RESIDENTIAL. AND THEN BY DEFINITION, IT'S A MIXED USE BILLING.
01:58:15.914: >> GREAT. OKAY. I THINK IT'S CLEAR THEN. SOMETIMES ALL BUILDINGS I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WAS A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING. I'LL WEIGH IN AND I LIKE THE IDEA OF THE MEMO BECAUSE IT REALLY DOES MOVE THE ACTION PROACTIVELY STARTING TO ZONE THOSE SPECIFIC CORRIDORS AND MOVING IT OUT ADS WE'RE SEEING IT NOW,. I THINK IT GIVES STRONG GUIDANCE TO THE PARAMETERS.  LIKE, THERE'S CERTAINLY A CONVERSATION FOR NEXT WEEK BUT A LOT OF THE COMMENTS TALKED ABOUT WHAT DO WE WANT TO SEE IN THAT AND WHAT DO WE WANT TO SEE INSTEAD OF ITALLIZING THINGS OUT?  I THINK AS IT'S WRITTEN RIGHT NOW IT'S LESS ABOUT ITEMIZING AND MORE ABOUT JUST GETTING THE BOXES TO CHECK UP THE GOALS. WE HAVE GOALS AND MAYBE THE SPECIFICS BECOME TROUBLESOME. IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S MORE DESIRE FOR NEXT USE. I SUPPORT REINTRODUCING THE COST.
01:59:50.175: >> COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN.
01:59:50.776: >> SO THIS IS PROBABLY A LITTLE BIT LATE IN THE GAME AND I MISSED THE LAST MEETING BUT SOMETHING THAT CAME UP AS I WAS DRIVING TODAY THROUGH OUR D1 AREAS AND SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN MEANING TO TRY TO FIX AT SOME POINT SOON BUT WE'VE HAD OTHER MORE PRESSING ISSUES. AMAZON TRUCKING AND SOME MAJOR ROADS.  FLUSH. WHAT WE'RE ENVISIONING T1 TO LOOK AT IS THOSE SORTS OF VEHICLES STOPPING ON MAIN ROADS AND IT MAY BE TOO LATE IN THE GAME THAT'S ALL I FIND. MAYBE WE CAN PUT THAT ON THE LIST FOR LATER ON.
02:00:53.705: >> I BELIEVE AT ONE POINT A VERSION HAD SOME SORT OF REQUIREMENT FOR BUT IT WAS NOT SPECIFIC, BUT THERE WAS MENTION OF A GENERAL AMENITY THAT MUST BE PROVIDED FOR CAR SHARING SERVICES AND GENERIC SERVICES. IT IS NOT IN THIS CURRENT DRAFT. I WOULD SAY AT THIS POINT IN TIME I THINK MAYBE A MORE HOLISTIC VIEW SHOULD BE TAKEN AND THERE'S ALSO A COMBINATION OF WHERE TO, WHAT SORT OF RULES AND REGULATIONS DO WE NEED OR MAYBE ENFORCEMENT IN THE RIGHT OF WAY VERSUS WHAT IMPROVEMENTS ARE NECESSARY ON PRIVATE PROPERTY. IT'S JUST A THING OF ANN ARBOR. WE DON'T SPECIFY HOW MANY LOADING DOCKS OR LOADING SPACES ARE NECESSARY. THE ORDINANCE BASICALLY SAYS YOU MUST PROVIDE AS MANY LOADING SPACES OR NOT AS YOU DEEM FIT. SO WE JUST DON'T, WE HAVEN'T YET GOTTEN INTO THAT REALM OF REQUIRING LOADING, DROPOFF, PICKUP, AND SO FORTH. AS LIFE EVOLVED AND MAYBE IT'S GROWING BUT THERE'S TWO SIDES OF IT. THERE'S CURBSIDE MANAGEMENT AND THEN THERE'S THE ONSITE IMPROVEMENTS THAT MIGHT BE NECESSARY.
02:02:34.839: >> THANK YOU. SO THIS IS JUST SOMETHING AS T1 TAKES OFF AN APPROACH ON ALL OF OUR ZONING DISTRICTS WITH REGARD TO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD TACKLE. I DON'T THINK IT'S SUPER URGENT, BUT I THINK IT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE ON YOUR TO-DO LIST AT SOME POINT IN TIME. THANK YOU.
02:03:02.634: >> YOU WERE IN THE CUE BEFORE AIT WAS ADDRESSED.  ANYONE ELSE, COMMISSIONER ABRONS?
02:03:07.939: >> I HAVE A COUPLE OF SMALL THINGS. I NOTICE THUN SPECIFIC PURPOSE STATEMENT - - I NOTICED IN THE SPECIFIC PURPOSE STATEMENT ON THE FIRST LINE IT SAYS WHEN APPROVING A PETITION TO REZONE A SITE FROM ITS CURRENT DESIGNATION TO TC1, I WONDERED IF THAT LANGUAGE IS FUNNY, IF THERE'S GOING TO BE A CITY-INITIATED REZONING.
02:03:35.867: >> WELL, WHETHER IT BE CITY INITIATED OR OWNER INITIATED THERE ARE ARE THE SAME STANDARDS THAT APPLY. SO IT WORKS BOTH WAYS.
02:03:46.077: >> OKAY, GREAT. AND THEN THIS IS MORE JUST LIKE A FOR MINOR INFORMATION, I NOTICED IN THE DIMENSIONAL STANDARDS TABLE SOMETHING ABOUT BUILDING BUILT BEFORE DECEMBER 262009, HAVING A DIFFERENT... I JUST WONDERED WHERE THAT DATE COMES FROM.
02:04:06.698: >> THAT'S HAD DATE OF - - NOW I'M BLANKING. THAT'S THE DATE OF THE AREA HEIGHT AND PLACEMENT REQUIREMENTS THAT ADDED A MAXIMUM FRONT SETBACK OR THAT'S THE DATE THAT A2 - - THAT IS THE DECEMBER 2009 IS WHEN A2D2 WAS ADOPTED WHICH REQUIRES TWO-STORY BUILDINGS.
02:04:26.017: >> GOT IT. AND THEN I THINK JUST IN TERMS OF THE LANGUAGE COMING OUT OF THE SPECIFIC PURPOSE STATEMENT OR BEING B3 I GUESS IS THE SECTION, I THINK I AGREE WITH COMMISSIONER SAUVE THAT I AM IN FAVOR OF THE MEMO. BUT I ALSO WANTED TO POSE THE QUESTION, IT SEEMED LIKE THE STAFF FEEDBACK THAT WE'RE GETTING, THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION WOULD BE TO REINSERT IT BECAUSE IT JUST PROVIDE MEARS CLARITY ABOUT THE INTENT. I THINK THE REASON WHY I WAS IN FAVOR OF REMOVING IS BECAUSE WHAT I HEARD THUN LAST DISCUSSION IS THAT IN ADDITION TO CLARIFYING INTENT, IT ALSO CLARIFIES PREFERENCE OR SOME HOW MAYBE UNINTENTIONALLY SIGNALS EXCLUSION OF OTHER AREAS AND I JUST WONDERED IF THERE'S A WAY TO DRAFT THE LANGUAGE SUCH THAT IT'S SPECIFIC AND USEFUL AND INCLUSIVE. SO MAYBE THE MEMO IS ACTUALLY. IT COULD BE THE MEMO IS THE WAY TO DO THAT BUT I APPRECIATE HEARING FROM ALEXIS AND BRAD ABOUT THAT. I THINK IF IT'S THAT TENSION THAT IS THE ONE THAT I'M UNCOMFORTABLE INCLUDING IT IF IT EXCLUDES OR PRODUCES AN OBSTACLE
02:06:01.045: >> I'LL STARTED.
02:06:03.581: >> I'LL START. FIRST OF ALL REMEMBER I'M NOT THE BOSS OF YOU.
02:06:06.117: >> YOUR EXPERTISE.
02:06:07.185: >> YOU NEED TO BECOMFORTABLE. I THINK ONE OF THINGS THAT... I DON'T THINK, I DON'T MAINTAIN OUR RECOMMENDATION IN THIS REGARD THAT ONE IS WRONG OR ONE IS RIGHT. I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S HAPPENING WITH THIS IS THAT THIS TRANSIT PROPOSE PROPOSED TRANSIT CORRIDOR DISTRICT DIRECTED BY CITY COUNCIL IS AN IMPLEMENTATION MECHANISM THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH DECADES OF MASTER PLANNING CONVERSATION. IN A VARIETY OF DOCUMENT SAID OVER MULLET MULTIPLE DECADES. SO THERE'S A LOT OF GOALS IN OUR MASTER PLANS THAT THIS PROPOSED DISTRICT SPEAKS TO AND FURTHERS GOAL STATEMENTS REGARDING. AT THE SAME TIME, YOU WILL NOT FIND IN OUR MASTER PLANS THE CITY SHALL CREATE A TC1 ZONING DISTRICT TO MEET ALL THESE GOALS.  SO THE THING THAT I LIKE ABOUT HAVING THOSE CORRIDORS RIGHT IN THE INTENT STATEMENT IS IT AT LEAST SETS A VERY DELIBERATE BRIDGE BETWEEN THOSE PLANNING DOCUMENTS AND AN IMPLEMENTATION TOOL SAYING INCH THESE SPECIFIC AREAS, THIS DISTRICT IS APPROPRIATE TO MEET THE GOALS THAT WE HAVE IDENTIFIED IN THAT AREA. WHEN YOU TAKE THOSE OUT, IT'S NOT I DON'T PROFESS THAT IT'S A DIFFERENT DECISION. THE DECISION IS THE SAME. IT'S STILL APPLYING THE PROPOSED REZONING OF THE PROPERTY TO A SPECIFIC PARCEL BUT IN THAT CASE IT'S A LITTLE BIT, IT'S ONE STEP BACK SAYING OKAY SOMEBODY'S COMING IN TO PROPOSE REZONING TC1 THAT'S ON THE WASHTENAW CORRIDOR, WHAT IS THE MASTER PLAN SAY?  IT SAYS IT'S MASTER PLANNED FOR COMMERCIAL. BUT WE ALSO HAVE THIS TRANSIT DISTRICT AND IT ALSO HAS THESE GOALS RELATED NON-MOTORIZED TRANSPORTATION AND MIXED USE SAID AND ADDING MORE CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN OUR TRANSITION SYSTEM AND REDUCING VEHICLES AS THE PRIMARY MODE OF TRANSPORTATION.  I JUST THINK, I LIKE THAT IT'S A STEP FORWARD IN OUR ORDINANCE SAYING IN THESE DISTRICTS, THIS ZONE SPEAKS TO THE GOALS OF THESE CORRIDORS. WHEN WE JUST KEEP IT BROAD I THINK WE'RE GOING TO BE HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS ON A LITTLE BIT WIDER LENS EVERY TIME WE PROPOSE REZONING. I THINK THAT JUST HAVING THOSE CORNERS IN THERE TAKES US A STEP CLOSER TO YEAH, THIS IS PROBABLY SUITABLE BECAUSE WE'VE IDENTIFIED THAT AND THAT WIDER RANGE IS ONLY GO GOING TO APPLY TO WHERE ELSE WE MIGHT MEET THE CHARACR O TSE. TTS WHEREE' COMING FROM SFF PERSPECTIVEO BE CLEAR AS I SAID AND YOU SPOKE TO THE RESOLUTION, I THINK THAT YOU ARE ACCOMPLISHING COUNCIL'S DIRECTION IN EITHER WAY HAVE ASKED FOR A ZONING DISTRICT, A GEOGRAPHIC. I THINK WHEN IT'S IN THE INTENT SECTION YOU'RE SORT OF DOING THAT ALL IN ONE ACTION, THE RESOLUTION IS A PERFECTLY ACCEPTABLE AND EFFECTIVE WAY TO DO THE SAME. THAT'S MY RATIONALE FOR WHY KEEPING THOSE CORRIDORS IN MAKES SENSE TO ME. ALEXIS, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO ADD ANYTHING FROM YOUR LENS.
02:09:41.699: >> NO, I WOULD HAVE SAID THE SAME THING.  AND A LOT MORE WORDS.
02:09:49.307: >> IS THERE A BURD - - I THINK I WANT TO KEEP IT THE WAY IT IS WITH THE MEMO BUT I JUST AM CURIOUS IS THERE A VERSION THAT COULD HAVE BEEN MORE INCLUSIVE THAT WOULD HAVE SAID SOME LIKE INCLUDING BUTANOL NAUGHT LIMITED TO?  - - BLUE PUTTING THESE IN HERE IT DOES MAKE IT HARDER FOR A PARCEL ON SOUTH INDUSTRIAL TO BE INCLUDED?
02:10:22.306: >> I DISAGREE WITH THAT. I CAN'T PREDICT THAT.  BUT I THINK THAT THE CHANGES YOU PROPOSED TO GENERALIZE THE ONE AND TWO PORTIONS OF THAT INTENT HELP CLARIFY IT COULD BE CONSIDERED ELSEWHERE.  I APPRECIATE THAT PERSPECTIVE BUT BY ALSO HAVE SOME SPECIFIC CORRIDORS LISTED MAYBE THERE'S A SORT OF PERCEIVED ADDITIONAL BARRIER WHEN YOU'RE OUT SOD -F THAT. I THINK WE'RE REDUCING A BARRIER ON THOSE CORRIDORS FROM APPLYING THE ZONING DISTRICT THERE BUT AT THE END I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR THE ACTIONS ARE THE SAME IS THAT THE CITY HAS TO DECIDE TO REZONE A PROPERTY BASE SAID ON THE ORDINANCE AND THE MASTER PLAN. I HONESTLY DON'T THINK THE INCLUSION OF THAT MAKES IT - - DEIT DOESN'T CHANGE THAT LEGISLATIVE DECISION, BUT AGAIN I THINK IT ACTUALLY HOLDS THE CITY A STEP MORE ACCOUNTABLE TO BE OPEN TOWARDS SAYING YES TO THAT REZONING BECAUSE WE SPECIFICALLY DESIGNATED THOSE CORRIDORS.
02:11:34.145: >> OKAY. APPRECIATE THAT PERSPECTIVE, THANKS.
02:11:46.557: >> COMMISSIONER DISCH?
02:11:48.426: >> I WAS JUST GOING TO ASK, COULD YOU SAY A LITTLE BIT MORE, MR. LEONARD, WHEN YOU SAID WE'RE REDUCING A BARRIER? IT'S BECAUSE WE'RE MAKING THE CITY MORE OPEN TO SAYING YES.
02:12:06.644: >> I THINK THAT BY CODE WE ARE INVITING APPLICATIONS OF THIS DISTRICT TO THESE GEOGRAPHIES. JUST BY INVITING IT DOESN'T MAKE IT SO, BUT WE ARE, THROUGH OUR LEGISLATIVE ACTION SAYING THAT'S A WAY OF SAYING WE WELCOME THESE ZONING DISTRICTS TO BE APPLIED IN THIS AREA. IT'S NOT TO SAY THAT THE CITY WOULDN'T BE WELCOMING WITHOUT THOSE, IT'S NOT TO SAY THAT THAT CHANGES THE CITY'S WELCOMING ELSEWHERE IN THE CITY THAT NEEDS THE OTHER IMPACT STATEMENTS, BUT I JUST THINK THAT IT IS IN A WAY IT'S TESTING US TO SAY WELL, YEAH OF COURSE THIS DISTRICT IS APPROPRIATE THERE.  IT'S SORT OF TESTING US AND CHALLENGING US TO SAY WHY WOULDN'T IT BE BECAUSE WE HAVE DESIGNATED THAT AREA. AGAIN, I DON'T WANT TO OVERSTATE IT, IT'S JUST THE INTENT SECTION, THE LEGISLATIVE ACTION IS THE SAME, BUT I THINK IT IS IF I'M A PROPERTY OWNER AND I'M LOOKING AT THAT ORDINANCE THINKING SHOULD I THINK ABOUT TC1?  & INTENT STATEMENT SAYS THE CITY FINDS IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE IN THIS GEOGRAPHY, THAT GIVES ME A CONFIDENCE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT. THAT MIGHT BE DIFFERENT THAN MAKE YOUR CASE AND WE'LL SEE IF IT MEETS THE CONDITIONS RESPONDING.
02:13:30.261: >> TO FOLLOW-UP AND MAKE SURE THAT I GET THIS TOO, BECAUSE I THINK I HEARD YOU SAY THIS EARLIER. EVEN IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WASHTENAW, WHICH WE EFFECTIVELY SAY THIS IS WHAT REIMAGINE WASHTENAW IS CALLING FOR, BUT IT DOES, REIMAGINE WASHTENAW, PART OF THE TOMB OF PLANNING DOCUMENTS, DOES NOT SAY TC1 IN IT. SO WHEN WE GO TO WHEN SOMEBODY ON WASHTENAW, IF THEY BEAT US TO REZONING, IF THEY BOAT BOO ITEM THE CITY TO REZONING, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THEM TO, LIKE THE REZONING APPLICATION SAYS, TELL US HOW YOU MEET THE INTENT OF THE ZONING DISTRICT BUT ALSO WHAT EVIDENCE DO YOU HAVE IN THE MASTER PLAN? PEOPLE, LIKE, THERE COULD BE ARGUMENTS MADE AGAINST WASHTENAW BECAUSE THAT WAS NOT A DISTRICT WHEN WE DID REIMAGINE WASHTENAW.
02:14:22.146: >> RIGHT.
02:14:22.513: >> WHAT WE'RE SAYING, THIS IS AFFIRMING THAT HEY IT WASN'T TALKED ABOUT IN THESE EXISTING DOCUMENTS, THESE CORRIDORS WEREN'T TALKED ABOUT BUT WE WILL SAY THESE PLACES, EASY, NO BRAINER. THERE ARE OTHERS THAT COULD MEET THIS CRITERIA, THAT COULD ALSO SATISFY THE CRITERIA BUT THESE ONES THERE SHOULD BE NO ARGUMENT AGAINST IT. IT'S JUST WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN AROUND TO IT YET.
02:14:48.973: >> YEAH. AND IT'S JUST INTENT. THE PLANNING SESSION COULD SAY EVEN IN A CORRIDOR RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE I THINK THAT WOULD BE FRANKLY A MORE QUESTIONABLE LEGISLATIVE DECISION ONCE WE'VE PUT IN THE INTENT STATEMENT THAT THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE PLACE FOR IT. YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
02:15:14.165: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT.
02:15:14.965: >> DO WE TYPICALLY MAYBE THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A SPECIALIZED ZONE DO WE TYPICALLY CALL OUT SPECIFIC CORRIDORS OR AREAS FOR WHICH THEY SHOULD APPLY IN INTENT STATEMENTS?
02:15:31.449: >> ALEXIS?  YOU'RE MUTED.
02:15:37.421: >> IT ALWAYS HAS TO BE ONE, RIGHT? THERE IS NO GEOGRAPHY CALLED OUT IN ANY OF THE OTHER ZONING DISTRICTS EXCEPT FOR THE CHARACTER AREAS IN THE CHARACTER OVERLAY DISTRICTS. HOWEVER, I WOULD SAY THAT 95 PERCENT OF THE DISTRICT CHARACTER INTENT STATEMENTS ARE WRITTEN IN 1953. SO NOW THEY ALL OF THE INTENT STATEMENTS ARE PRETTY SPECIFIC, AND THEY'RE ALL EACH DIFFERENT AND THEY ALL HAVE VERY SPECIFIC LANGUAGES ABOUT WHERE THEY SHOULD BE LOCATED, CHARACTERISTICS, AND WHAT THEIR INTENT ARE, BUT THEY DON'T HAVE STREET iS IDENTIFIED LIKE WE ARE DOING HERE. AGAIN MOST WERE WRITTEN IN 1953.
02:16:33.177: >> OKAY. I IT SOUNDS LIKE WE HAVEN'T WRITTEN A ZONING DISTRICT IN A WHILE. I COULD GO EITHER WAY I THINK I DEFINITELY WANT TO DO MEMO REGARDLESS. I THINK THE MEMO SIGNALS MORE THAT WE NOT ONLY IDENTIFY THAT THESE ARE THE AREAS THAT SHOULD HAVE A ZONING APPLY, BUT WE WANT TO PROACTIVELY REZONE THEM. I WILL POINT OUT THAT THERE'S SOME CONFLICT WITH THE PLYMOUTH ROAD ONE, THE SECTION THREE SAYS TO - - I'M SURE WE CAN SORT THAT OUT. I DEFINITELY WANT TO DO A MEMO AND I NEED TO THINK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE ORDINANCE TEXT.
02:17:24.728: >> COMMISSIONER SAUVE WANTS TO ADD IN HERE.
02:17:28.265: >> BUSINESS DISTRICT I KNOW IT'S A DANGEROUS THING TO BRING UP BUT WE'RE SEEING THE SAME, LIKE, SCRUTINY BECAUSE THERE'S PROXIMITY LANGUAGE INSTEAD OF JUST SAYING THIS IS HOW IT'S INTENDED TO BE APPLIED IN POPULATIONS. WE'VE GOT THIS CAMPUS THING, WHICH I THINK YOU CAN MAKE AN ARGUMENT EITHER WAY IN TERMS OF TRANSIT CORRIDORS AND CAMPUS AND SYNONYMOUS WHEN TALKING ABOUT THOSE TWO ZONING DISTRICT TYPES SO I JUST KIND OF WANT TO BRING IT UP FOR THOUGHT ABOUT PROACTIVELY REZONING AND WHAT THAT MEANS AND HOW THIS IS OR ISN'T A TOOL FOR ADDITIONAL PARCELS AND HOW WE'VE SEEN IT TRY TO BE APPLIED BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE A ZONING TYPE AVAILABLE OTHER THAN CAMPUSES IN THE DISTRICT THAT MEET SOME OF THESE GOALS NOW. LAKE, WE NOW HAVE TC1 THAT I THINK OVERLAP SOME OF WHAT I THINK CAMPUS BUSINESS DISTRICT WAS TRYING TO DO WITH THE NEW YORK CAMPUS. JUST KIND OF BRINGING THAT UP MAYBE FOR ADDITIONAL THOUGHT IN TERMS OF HOW TO DEAL WITH THAT INTERPRETATION AND APPLICATION AREA THAT WE WISH WE HAD TC1 FOR AVAILABLE PARCELS AND THAT MAY BE IN THE VENN DIAGRAM STILL LEAVING THE OPPORTUNITY OUT OF IT AND THAT'S STILL MY CONCERN. I THINK THE PROACTIVE IS WHAT'S A REALLY NICE ADDED LAYER ESPECIALLY IN THIS MEMO, AND THEN LEAVING KIND OF THE REST TO BE ABLE TO MANIFEST WITH GOOD ARGUMENTS.
02:19:10.034: >> GO AHEAD.  I HAD SOMETHING I THINK THAT BRINGS UP A COUPLE OF REALLY GOOD POINTS. CONTRADICTORY POINTS, ACTUALLY.
02:19:17.942: >> I JUST WANT TO SAY, I JUST WANT TO REMIND THAT THIS IS A NEW DISTRICT AND I WANT TO SET THE EXPECTATION WHETHER THESE CORRIDORS ARE INCLUDED IN THAT INTENT SECTION OR NOT DOESN'T PRECLUDE US FROM GOING BACK IN THE FUTURE AND CLARIFYING THAT BASED ON OUR EXPERIENCE. I ALSO THINK TO AN EXTENT THAT MEMO HAS A LITTLE LESS WEIGHTED AS CONVEYING TO AT LEAST THE CITY COUNCIL, THESE ARE THE, THESE ARE DEFINITELY THE AREAS THAT THIS IS APPROPRIATE FOR. SO I JUST REMEMBER IF YOU CHOOSE NOT TO INCLUDE THOSE NOW, IT DOESN'T PRECLUDE US IN THE FUTURE FROM TRYING TO CLARIFY, ADD BETTER LANGUAGE, IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT END UPZONING TO BE A STRUGGLE. SO I JUST WANTED TO, I JUST WANT TO REMIND FOLKS OF THAT. WE CAN LEARN ON THE INTENT SECTION LIKE WE'RE GOING TO LEARN ON THE REALIZATION OF THIS ZONING DISTRICT.
02:20:24.408: >> COMMISSIONER DISCH.
02:20:29.980: >> THIS MATTER IS AS MUCH IF AND WHEN WE MOVE FROM PETITIONER INITIATED TO CITY INITIATED ZONING FOR THESE CORRIDORS.
02:20:40.457: >> IT WOULDN'T.  I DON'T THINK IT WOULD MATTER FOR PETITIONER INITIATED REZONING THAN IT WOULD FOR CITY INITIATED REZONING.
02:20:52.670: >> RIGHT, SO FOR THE MOMENT IT MATTERS BECAUSE THERE'S DISCUSSION ON THE COUNCIL AS TO WHETHER OR NOT TO GRANT A PETITION BUT IF WE ENVISION TIME FIRMING THESE UP AS CITY-INITIATED ZONING, THERE'S NO DISCRETION ON CITY COUNCIL IT DOESN'T MATTERS MUC WHICIS NOTO SAY SHOUL'T PUT IT I THERDINAN NOW. I THINK WE PROBABLY SHOULD.
02:21:21.031: >> I WOULD SAY THAT MAYBE THIS KIND OF SQUARING THOSE TWO THINGS UP, IF YOU IMAGINED EVERYTHING THAT SOMEBODY COULD CONSTRUE AS A CORRIDOR IN THE FUTURE HAS BEEN REZONED THIS WAY. THIS IS WHERE I THINK COMMISSIONER SAUVE, I DID NOT WANT TO BRING UP CAMPUS, BUT I THINK IT'S A GOOD EXAMPLE ABOUT HOW FIRST, ONE, THAT IS TIED INTO PROXIMITY WHICH IS WHAT OURS IS, BUT WHAT CAMPUS HAS CHANGED OVER TIME.  WHAT IS A CORRIDOR HAS CHANGED OVER TIME. THAT MAKES IT REALLY HARD IN SOME WAYS.  THEN THERE'S DISPUTES OVER WHAT'S OUR INTENT RIGHT NOW, AND HOW SHOULD THAT. ON THE ONE HAND I WANT TO PUT IN THERE WHAT CORRIDORS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BUT KNOWING THAT'S SOMETHING I WOULD WANT TO CHANGE OVER TIME BECAUSE I'M EXPECTING THAT IT'S GOING TO CHANGE. SO I GUESS THIS IS USING THAT RECENT EXPERIENCE OF SOMETHING THAT IS ABOUT A PLACE BUT ACTUALLY THAT CAMPUS BUSINESS DISTRICT DOES NOT NAME SPECIFIC PLACES, RIGHT, IT'S SORT OF LIKE WHAT WE'RE MOVING TO WHICH IS LIMITED, PROXIMATE, CORRIDOR, UP FOR INTERPRETATIONLINGER â€” I CAN TOTALLY SEE WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM ON WANTING TO BE MORE SPECIFIC BECAUSE FOR THE TIME IT WORKS BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT THEN EVOLVES IN TIME. HOW DOES THIS NOT BECOME OBSOLETE WHEN, YEAH, HOW DOES IT NOT BECOME OBSOLETE?  WHEN WE'RE NAMING THEM NOW BUT THE EXPECTATION IS THAT MAYBE IN THE NEXT MASTER PLAN WHICH WE SHOULD DO TO MAKE NOW THAT WE HAVE A DISTRICT TO SEE DOES MORE OF THE CITY FALL INTO WHAT WE HAVE? SHOULD WE REALLY BE THINKING ABOUT MORE PROACTIVE REZONING? HOW DOES THAT FIT INTO THE EVOLUTION OF OUR MASTER PLAN OVER TIME AND WHAT HAPPENS ALONG OTHER, WHAT PLACES THAT ARE TRANSIT ACCESSIBLE RIGHT NOW BUT MAYBE THAT WE DON'T CONSIDER CORRIDORS BUT COULD BE IN 10 YEARS, 15 YEARS.
02:24:03.760: >> I WOULD SAY THAT THE MASTER, WELL, THE MASTER PLAN NOR THE ZONING ORDINANCE IS INTENDED TO BE STATIC OR CONCRETE IS A VALID CRITICISM THAT WE DON'T UPDATE OUR ZONING ORDINANCE ENOUGH AND WE DON'T WORK ON, WE HAVEN'T RECENTLY WORKED ON PLANNING ENOUGH BUT IF ALL GOES AS PLANNED WE MIGHT BE TALKING NEXT YEAR ABOUT A TC2 AND PROBABLY SOME AMENDMENTS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE MADE TO CLARIFY THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN TC1 AND TC2. I THINK THAT WE NEED TO TAKE MORE ADVANTAGE OF THOSE OPPORTUNITIES TO CONTINUALLY REFINE WHAT DO WE MEAN, AND TO EXPAND OR CONTRACT AND ALSO MAKE SURE THAT THE DIFFERENT DISTRICTS PLAY NICELY WITH EACH OTHER. SO I DON'T... I THINK THAT WHATEVER IS DECIDED, THERE ARE ALWAYS OPPORTUNITIES FOR AMENDMENTS TO DO EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AS THINGS EVOLVE OVER TIME, AS WE INTRODUCE DISTRICTS. MAYBE EVERYONE MOVES DISTRICTS OR CONSOLIDATES SO IT'S JUST PART OF OUR WORK. I WOULDN'T BE CONCERNED, I WONT BE AFRAID, AND I DON'T THINK THAT WE CAN MAKE A MISTAKE BECAUSE WE CAN ALWAYS ENTERTAIN A SIMILAR PROCESS TO CONTINUALLY GET IT RIGHT. THE ZONING ORDINANCE IS SUPPOSED TO BE CONSTANTLY WORKED AT TO MAKE SURE THAT A, WE'RE GETTING IT RIGHT, AND B, WE ARE EVOLVING WITH THE CHANGING MARKET CONDITIONS, AND CHANGING DEMANDS, AND CHANGING NEEDS AND SO FORTH. THERE'S NOT NECESSARILY A RIGHT OR WRONG ANSWER AND THIS IS NOT A BE ALL END ALL AND A NEVER NO OPPORTUNITY FOR EITHER CORRECTIONS OR LEARNING AND.
02:26:08.218: >> COMMISSIONER DISCH, AND THEN COMMISSIONER SAUVE.
02:26:11.488: >> THAT'S A WRONGNESSER FOR YOU BUT THERE'S NO WRONG ANSWER OR RIGHT.
02:26:16.827: >> I THINK COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN YOU ANSWERED YOUR OWN QUESTION IN THE SENSE THAT THE PRINCIPLE BEHIND NAMING THESE FOUR, IT'S FOUR RIGHT?  IS THAT THEY ARE LINKED TO MASTER PLANNED ELEMENT ELEMENTS THAT WE HAVEN'T YET IMPLEMENTED. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE IS WE ARE GOING TO UPDATE OUR MASTER PLAN.  THAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN. AS THAT HAPPENS THERE MAY BE MORE PLACES WHERE WE WRITE IN THIS COULD BE APPROPRIATE FOR, OR THIS IS APPROPRIATE FOR, AND THEN YOU ADVANCE ON THE SAME PRINCIPLE, BUT THEN THERE'S MASTER PLAN UNDERPINNING FOR IT. I THINK IT STRONGEST ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF PUTTING THESE FOUR INTO THE ORDINANCE NOW, AND NOT WORRYING ABOUT IT AS A LIMIT IS THAT THESE ARE THE FOUR THAT ARE LINKED TO THE MASTER PLAN AND THEY GIVE US A CONCRETE EXAMPLE OF THINGS WE MIGHT EXTRAPOLATE IS THIS LIKE X. WHEN A PETITIONER COMES WITH SOMETHING OUTSIDE AND THEY SAY I WANT TO DO HILLDALE DRIVE AND THE STEM STREET AND WE SAY THAT'S NOT REALLY VERY MUCH LIKE ANY OF THESE OTHER THINGS IN ANY WAY, SHAPE OR FORM SO NO, WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET THAT HAPPEN. I ACTUALLY DON'T SEE THIS AS A PROBLEMATIC LIMIT. I ACTUALLY SEE THIS IS AS GROUNDING THIS ON THE PRINCIPLE THAT PLANNING DRIVES ZONING AND THAT PUTS ON ON VERY SAFE GROUND IN TERMS OF THIS PETITIONER-INITIATED PERIOD BEFORE THESE GET WRITTEN AS CITIED INITIATED ZONING.
02:28:06.470: >> COMMISSIONER SAUVE.  FLUSHEN.
02:28:10.173: >> SO I GUESS A FEW POINTS. IN ALL CASES OF REZONING WE HAVE TO POINT TO MASTER PLANNING THE MASHER PLANNING DOCUMENT TO MAKE A CASE FOR WHY THE REZONING IS APPROPRIATE. IN ALL OTHER POINTS OF THE ORDINANCE WE DON'T LAY IT OUT, SPELL IT OUT IN THE UDC WHAT THOSE MASTER PLAN DOCUMENTS ARE ON UNPACK THE ZONES FOR IT. WHY IS THIS CASE DIFFERENT IN ALL REZONING CASES THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN A PART OF THE PETITION SO WE'RE GOING TO SEE THAT AGAIN AND ALL OF THESE DOCUMENTS ARE ALREADY SHOWING THAT. WORKING WITH DEVELOPERS, IT DOES GIVE AN IMPLIED DIRECTION TO WHAT'S ALLOWED AND WHAT'S NOT ALLOWED AND GIVEN THE RISK ASSOCIATE WOULD GOING THROUGH THE PLANNING PROCESS TO NOT SEE YOUR PARCEL INCLUDED IN THIS MEANS IT'S AN AN EXCLUDED INTERPRETATION. I'LL SAY THAT FROM EXPERIENCE ON OTHER PROJECTS.  IT FEELS LIKE A BIGGER HURTLE AND LESS LIKELY TO PROCEED. I GUESS LIKE THE LAST THING BACK TO CAMPUS BUSINESS DISTRICT IS I THINK THAT ONE I BRING IT UP TO OPEN UP THIS CONVERSATION BECAUSE I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE TALK ABOUT ALL ANGLES IS IT WAS THE INTERPRETATION OF WHAT IS CAMPUS AND THEN THE ARGUMENT OF IT WAS WRITTEN WHEN IT WAS A DOWNTOWN CAMPUS. SO IT'S STILL INTENDED RELATIVE TO ITS ASSOCIATION OF THE DOWNTOWN CAMP OUTS IT SHOULD ALWAYS BE ADJACENT TO CAMPUS BECAUSE THAT'S THE SENSE THAT IMPACTS SERVICE.  I THINK THE INTENT STATEMENT HERE DOES SAY THAT IT NEEDS TO BE A REGULAR FIXED SERVICE WITH THE AAPA AND ON ESTABLISHED COMMERCIAL. SO IT HAS KIND OF BENCHMARKS OF NOT NEW FRESHER RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, BUT IT HAS KIND OF INCREMENTAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS OF THOSE THINGS NEED TO BE MET FOR THIS TO BE AN AREA. TO POINT TO.  EVEN IF THIS ISN'T ADDRESSED IN A DECADE OR SO I FELTLIKE GENERAL INTENT STATEMENT DOES TALK ABOUT GROWTH AND REVOLUTION IN THAT WAY TO CAPTURE IT. I'LL JUST KIND OF STILL SAY THAT DEVELOPERS READING THE UDC ARE GOING TO SEE THEIR ZONES NOT INCLUDE, THEY'RE GOING TO FEEL LIKE IT'S A BIGGER HURTLE BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO LOOK LESS BY RIGHT JUST BY INTERPRETATION. I KNOW THERE'S INTERPRETATION OF PLANNING STAFF, THERE'S COMMISSIONER REVIEW AND CITY COUNCIL REVIEW, BUT I'M JUST KIND OF LAYING IN FROM EXPERIENCE SO YOU AWARE OF IT AND THAT'S IT.
02:30:59.876: >> THAT POINT JUST TO FOLLOW-UP QUICKLY IF I MAY, COMMISSIONER DISCH, TO JUMP IN. I MEAN, AND MAYBE THIS IS A QUESTION TO STAFF LIKE THESE ARE THE CORRIDORS THAT HAVE OFTEN COME UP IN THAT THERE'S A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT ARE IN THIS INTENT STATEMENT AS YOU MENTIONED MR. LEN -RT, ARE FROM YEARS OLD MASTER PLANS. THAT ARE CITY-WIDE GOALS.  EVEN SO THERE ARE NOT EVERY CITY GOAL IS ACCOMPLISHED IN EVERY SINGLE PARCEL OF THE CITY ON EVERY SINGLE STREET OF THE CITY. AND I FEEL LIKE WHERE I INTERPRETED KIND OF THE CERTAINTY GOING IS THAT SOME OF THIS STUFF IS LIKE APPLE PIE OR WHATEVER THE SAYING IS. THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS YOU CAN SUPPORT WITH OUR MASTER PLAN GENERALLY. I DON'T THINK WE'RE READY TO SAY EVERY PARCEL â€” I'M NOT CERTAINLY AT THE POINT TO SAY EVERY PARSE -TSAL IN â€” PARCEL IN THE CITY IS OKAY. THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT THAT OUGHT TO BE SEEN AS BY RIGHT. I THINK THAT SOME PLACES WE MIGHT WANT TO GIVE WE NEED TO GO THROUGH THE PLASTER PLANNING PROCESS WE NEED TO HAVE A MASTER PLANNING PROCESS WHEN HOUSING CRISIS IS ONE OF THE GOALS OF THE CITY. I'M ACTUALLY I THINK I DON'T WANT TO PASS FALSE HOPE ON TO PEOPLE PERSONALLY. BY SAYING. TO SEE COOL IN ANN ARBOR. THAT'S AMONG THE REASONS WHY SAYING THIS IS VERY CLEAR. NOT TO SAY THAT IT'S NOT POSSIBLE BUT ALSO MAYBE WE'RE NOT GOING TO SEE A RUSH ON THI.
02:33:18.782: >> I JUST WANTED TO ADDRESS T POINT THAT COMMISSIONER SAUVE RAISED ABOUT WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS. AND. THIS IS A POTENTIALLY LARGE CHANGE TO THE FEELING OF THE SCALE OF THE CITY. FOR ALL THE REASONS THAT YOU SAID EARLIER WHEN WE WERE TALKING ABOUTS PLYMOUTH ROAD. BECAUSE OF THAT, AND BECAUSE WE ARE ESSENTIALLY CATCHING UP WITH MASTER PLAN DOCUMENTS THAT ARE SOME 5 YEARS OLD, SOME A DECADE OLD WHICH IS REALLY NOT THAT OLD ACTUALLY GIVEN HOW SLOW THINGS CHANGE IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AND THERE IS A CONCERN ABOUT LEGIT - - LEGITIMACY THAT MAKING DIRECT REFERENCE TO MASTER PLAN DOCUMENTS CAN BE VERY HELPFUL WITH. NOT IN EVERY INSTANCE OF A ZONING CHANGE IS THERE SUCH A BIG CONCERN ABOUT LEGITIMACY.
02:34:39.295: >> COMMISSIONER ABRONS.
02:34:40.263: >> I THINK I JUST, I THINK FOR ME IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND THIS ISN'T GOING TO BE AN OVERNIGHT TRANSFORMATION OF THIS CITY.  I THINK IT IS GOING TO BE VERY INCREMENTAL AND SLOW AND IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME COMING AND I WOULDN'T, I DON'T, I DON'T WANT TO SEE US LIMIT IT, I GUESS.  I'M MORE LEANING TOWARDS THINKING ABOUT WAYS TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S INCLUES NAME NOT â€” INCLUSIVE AND NOT LIMITING AS OPPOSED TO IT BEING CONCERN ABOUT A FREE FOR ALL BEING SIGNALED THROUGH THE ORDINANCE BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE STATE OF AFFAIRS. IT COULD BE TRANSFORMATIONAL FOR THE CITY BUT I THINK THAT TRANSFORMATION IS GOING TO BE DECADES IN THE MAKING. FOR ME INCLUDING THE CORRIDOR BY NAME IN THE ORDINANCE THAT WE ALREADY KNOW WE'RE ALREADY ITACING ABOUT THEIR POTENTIAL TO BE UPDATED IN THIS NEW MASTER PLAN THAT WE'RE GOING TO UNDERTAKE SOON FEELS A LITTLE BIT UNNECESSARY I GUESS.
02:36:10.486: >> WE WENT RIGHT TO LIKE THE BIG THING THAT WAS REALLY THE SECOND PART OF THIS. I MIGHT FEEL LIKE, I DON'T HEAR CONSENSUS. WHICH IS A BUMMER. SO OTHERS TO CHIME IN ON THIS ISSUE IN PARTICULAR.  I MEAN, THIS TO SOME EXTENT IS THE BIG THING THAT'S GOING TO DETERMINE WHETHER WE HAVE ANOTHER MOTION; RIGHT? WELL, AND ACTUALLY COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT, I HEARD HER SAY WE SHOULD DO A MEMO NO MATTER WHAT. SO, LIKE, SO THERE SHOULD BE A SECOND PART OF THIS. DO WE NEED TO TAKE A BREAK FOR JUST A MINUTE TO STRETCH LEGS? OR DO WE WANT TO KEEP ON - - LIKE... I NEED TO DRINK OF WATER TO FIGURE OUT, TOO. MYSELF. COMMISSIONER ABRONS.
02:37:06.876: >> JUST MAYBE WHEN WE TAKE A BREAK WHEN WE COME BACK FROM A BREAK WHAT WOULD BE HELPFUL WOULD BE TO SUMMARIZE WHERE WE HAVE. ARE - - ARE WHERE WE ARE. THERE WERE FRIENDLY AMENDMENTS OR MINOR REVISIONS AND THEN ARE THERE ANY OTHER ISSUES THAT ARE GOING TO REQUIRE THIS KIND OF DIALOGUE AND DEBATE OR IS THIS THE ONE? THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR ME BECAUSE I'VE KIND OF LOST TRACK OF THE JOURNEY.
02:37:33.836: >> I THINK THAT THAT'S HELPFUL AND SO I FEEL LIKE - - THE ONLY THING THAT'S WRITTEN DOWN ON MY LIST THAT CAME UP IN PUBLIC COMMENT TONIGHT WAS THE HEIGHT LIMIT, NOT THE ONE STORY, IT'S THE OTHER END OF THE HEIGHT LIMIT. AND SO WE, I THINK, WE OUGHT TO HAVE A SHORT DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT. AT LEAST. ANYTHING ELSE THAT AS I'M FILLING MY WATER BOTTLE, WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT?
02:38:10.606: >> COMMISSIONER GOOD GIBB-RANDALL RANDALL.
02:38:11.607: >> NOT DISCUSSING THIS UNTIL 11:30 P.M. I ACTUALLY HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO. I REALLY AM NOT KEEN ON LETTING THIS DRAW OUT FOR A LOT LONGER SO I'D BE KEEN ON A SHORT BREAK, AND THEN TRYING TO DO A PITHY SUMMARY AND FIGURE OUT WHERE WE ARE DISCUSSING THE HEIGHT LIMIT THING BRIEFLY AND FIGURING OUT -
02:38:29.826: >> WHAT WE WANT TODO THANK YOU. I FORGET THAT IT'S - - THANK YOU FOR REMINDING. ALL RIGHT, LET'S IF WE CAN TAKE FOUR MINUTES WE'LL COME BACK AT 9:45 P.M.
02:47:31.567: >> AS YOU CAN SEE THERE'S A COUPLE OF WAYS TO, THERE IS MORE THAN ONE WAY TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE. I THINK PERHAPS THE MOST EXPEDIENT FORM THIS EVENING WOULD BE A FOURTH LEVEL OF PROXIMITY TO RESIDENTIAL.
02:47:51.253: >> COMMISSIONER RANDALL DID YOU RAISE YOUR HAND? THEN COMMISSIONER DISCH.
02:48:00.562: >> COMMISSIONER DISCH:  I WONDER IF WE COULD IF WE THINK IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE FOR THE STATE AND EISENHOWER, RATHER THAN BUILDING IN ANOTHER PIECE OF THIS GENERAL ORDINANCE THAT COULD THEN GO WHEREVER IT'S A THOUSAND FEET FOR REZ DENGAL, I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PLACES THAT WOULD REALIST LACK Y BE, WHAT IF WE JUST POSTPONED THAT AND RECONSIDERED HEIGHT LIMITS FOR STATE AND EISENHOWER IF AND WHEN WE ARE TAKING UP THE QUESTION OF PERMANENTLY REZONING, WHICH I THINK SARAH ALREADY BROUGHT UP SOMETHING SHE WANTED TO WORK ON. COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT, SORRY. ALL.
02:49:02.591: >> THIS IS NOT SET IN STONE, SOME OF THIS STUFF CAN EVOLVE AND WILL ADVISE. COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN.
02:49:11.834: >> I WOULD PREFER THAT WE MAKE THIS PART OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NOW VERSUS SOMETHING LATER ON OR MAYBE WHEN WE'RE REZONING. I'D RATHER GET THIS PART DONE AND KNOW THAT IT'S DONE SO THAT WE CAN MOVE ON. I DO LIKE ALEXIS' IDEA OF A THOUSAND FOOT DISTANCE FROM RESIDENTIAL TO GO TO 250, 300 FEET, SOME NUMBER LIKE THAT. I THINK THAT'S THE BEST WAY. BUT I DON'T WANT TO KICK THE CAN BECAUSE WE HAVE A REALLY GOOD TRACK RECORD OF DOING THAT AND THEN NOTHING EVER HAPPENS WITH IT. SO LET'S NOT KICK THE CAN, LET'S JUST GET THIS, LET'S HAVE THIS DISCUSSION AND MOVE ON FROM IT.
02:49:55.444: >> COMMISSIONER DISCH:  WOULD THAT HAVE TO GO BACK TO ORC, IF WE MADE THAT CHANGE? OKAY.
02:50:06.755: >> BUT IF WE WANTED TO VOTE ON IT TONIGHT WE SHOULD KNOW WHAT THE DISTANCE IS. AND WHAT THAT HEIGHT LIMIT IS AND THEN WE CAN EXTRAPOLATE A LITTLE BIT LOOKING AT THE MAP, THE 300-FOOT CONTOUR GIVES YOU A BIT TO HELP, COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN.
02:50:24.940: >> WITH REGARDS TO DISTANCE FROM RESIDENTIAL, DO WE HAVE, SO WITH... I GUESS I'M THINKING OF LOOKING FROM RESIDENTIAL AND SCHOOLS CAN SOMEONE REMIND ME IS THAT 600 OR A THOUSAND.
02:50:47.329: >> A THOUSAND FEET FROM SCHOOLS AND 600 FEET FROM ONE ANOTHER.
02:50:53.168: >> OKAY, SO I WOULD BE FINE WITH THE THOUSAND I WOULD BE FINE WITH A THOUSAND FEET. WITH REGARDS TO HEIGHT, 300? HOW MANY I GUESS HOW MANY STORYSIS 300?
02:51:14.389: >> 30?
02:51:15.591: >> YEAH, PROBABLY, PROBABLY A LITTLE LESS THAN THAT, 28, 29, IF I HAD TO GUESS.
02:51:22.231: >> SOUNDS GOOD.
02:51:29.605: >> MY INITIAL REACTION TO THAT, THAT METHOD, THAT THOUSAND, IT'S TIED TO SOMETHING ELSE THAT WE HAVE WITH JUST LOOKING AT THE MAP THIS IS REALLY GOING TO APPLY IN VERY FEW PLACES WHICH COULD BE A GOOD THING. THE CONTOURS HELP THERE A LOT. BUT EVEN THE THANK YOU, STAFF, FOR PULLING THIS MAP TOGETHER. MY READING OF THIS IS THAT THERE'S SOME RESIDENTIALLY ZONED PARCELS THAT ARE LIKE THAT IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S SOUTHEASTISH OF THE MALL THAT MAKE THIS BEAM, THAT WHEN YOU MAKE THAT THOUSAND FOOT SET BACK IT'S GOING GOING TO IT MAY ALMOST GO ALL THE WAY UP TO EISENHOWER ON THE SOUTH SIDE IF YOU JUST LOOK AT IT IT'S KIND OF SQUEEZED IN. THERE IS VERY, VERY - - SO, I LEAK THE IDEA OF DOING THAT BUT, LIKE, HAVING THE MAP TO BACK IT UP AND SHOW US IF IT'S ACTUALLY ANY EFFECT MAY BE HELPFUL. COMMISSIONER SAUVE.
02:52:41.109: >> WITH R5 INCLUDE WOULD WOULD THAT SETBACK BE NEGATED IF THIS MAP WERE UPDATED THEN?
02:52:48.884: >> R5 IS NON NOT CONSIDERED A RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT.
02:52:52.254: >> BECAUSE THERE'S AN ISLAND RIGHT NEXT TO THE MALL THAT COMMISSIONER MILLS IS TALKING ABOUT THAT I BELIEVE IT'S R5 LIKE KENSINGTON HOTEL AND EVERYTHING SO THAT WOULD NOT SQUEEZE IT OUT AS MUCH.
02:53:08.804: >> THAT'S HELPFUL.
02:53:13.041: >> DO YOU SEE WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ALEXIS?
02:53:18.647: >> HIDDEN VALLEY APARTMENTS IS MUCH CLOSER TO 777 EISENHOWER THAN THE SIGNATURE VILLAS ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE. ALTHOUGH, SO THERE'S ONE POINT WHERE R4C ZONING IS 655 FEET FROM 777 EISENHOWER.
02:53:53.448: >> I THINK GENERALLY JUST LOOKING THE ONLY PARCELS ALONG WASHTENAW THAT WOULD BE ELIGIBLE WOULD BE THE FRONTAGE OF PROBABLY NOT EVEN THE FRONTAGE OF ARBORLAND BECAUSE THE RESIDENTIAL ACROSS THE STREET WOULD SO IT'S PROBABLY NOTHING ALONG WASHTENAW. IT WOULD PROBABLY ONLY BE APPLICABLE AT STATE AND EISENHOWER.  WE COULD, IF THAT'S A DESIRE BASED ON THAT CONVENTION, WE WOULD MAKE SURE TO INCLUDE MAPLE VILLAGE MAPS AND MAKE SURE THAT THE COUNCIL IS SEEING EXACTLY WHAT IF THAT IS, AS WELL, AS PART OF THAT.
02:54:39.261: >> I'M SEEING THUMBS UP FROM COMMISSIONER SAUVE. A NOD FROM COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN, AND A HAND FROM COMMISSIONER ABRONS.
02:54:49.204: >> I'M WONDERING IF WE COULD CONSIDER A SMALLER NUMBER THAN A THOUSAND IF IT'S EFFECTIVELY LIMITING IT TO, I THINK OVER ON THE STADIUM CORRIDOR IT WOULD ON THE PARKING LOT IN FRONT OF PLUMB WOULD BE OKAY WHERE CORE LIFE EATERY IS, THAT KIND -F LOT I THINK A THOUSAND IS TOO BIG. IT'S HARD TO DO IT ON THE FLY.
02:55:25.507: >> I THINK IT'S SOME SORT OF - - I FEEL LIKE DOUBLING 300-FOOT BUILDINGS MAYBE THERE'S A LITTLE BIT TALLER BUT A LITTLE BIT FURTHER AWAY. IT'S GOING TO BE A THOUSAND FEET AND 300 FEET, AND THEN APPLY NOWHERE AND I DON'T SEE THE POINT IN DOING THAT.
02:55:44.192: >> I WAS JUST THINKING LIKE WE'VE GOT A 300-FOOT BUFFER FRAWLEY 150 FEET IS THAT RIGHT? OR 120 FEET?
02:55:53.135: >> WHY DOUBLE IT?
02:55:55.937: >> IT'S SCALED. IF YOU IMAGINE A 600-FOOT BUFFER FOR 240 FEET OR 250 FEET THAT'S STILL I THINK EVEN WITH A 600-FOOT BUFFER EVEN OF THAT. IS THAT FAIR?
02:56:26.668: >> I DON'T WANT, IT WOULD JUST BE SOMETHING THAT SPECIFICALLY WOULD WANT TO SPEND A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME WITH. I THINK THE SMALLER THAT NUMBER IS, THE MORE POTENTIAL THERE IS FOR IT TO HAPPEN ELSEWHERE. I DO THINK THAT THE CHARACTER OF STATE STREET AND EISENHOWER IS SUCH THAT IT'S PROBABLY, IT'S JUST PROBABLY EASIER TO GET TO THOSE HEIGHTS THERE WITH A BIGGER DIMENSION. BUT, YEAH, SORT OF THE SAME MIND THAT I THINK I SORT OF FEEL LIKE THAT THOUSAND FOOT IS SAFE AS WE ELSEWHERE THROUGH THEITY.ON AGAIN, IT DOESN'TN THAT W CAN'T REVISE -T IT IF WE IT TURNS OUT WE WANT TO OPEN UP FLEXIBILITY. I THINK ARGUABLY THAT IS GOING TO PROBABLY PRECLUDE THAT IN MOST OF THE CORRIDORS EXCEPT THAT AREA.
02:57:26.361: >> WHICH SMS LIKE THE WOULD BE MOREOMFORTLE WITHHA BUT  CAN ALSOOOSE IT B THE IMARY GOAL. A THOUSAND FOOT SEEMS GOOD ESPECIALLY AT THAT CORNER. COISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL.
02:57:44.145: >> I JUST LOOKED AT WASHTENAW AND YOU CAN'T DO IT AT: BEING ACROSS THE STREET FROM LIKE AT THE FRONT OF ARBORLAND YOU'RE TOO CLOSE TO THE RESIDENTIAL ACROSS THE STREET IS LESS THAN 600 FEET. THAT 600 FEET. SO LIKE A THOUSAND FEET SEEMS COMPLETELY SAFE BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO KIND OF FINE TUNE IT. IS IT SO TERRIBLE TO HAVE SOMETHING AT THE FRONT OF WASHTENAW AND ARBORLAND? PROBABLY NOT. AND NOT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET. A THOUSAND WOULD BE SAFE BUT I DON'T KNOW, IT FEELS A LITTLE FUNNY.
02:58:26.254: >> THIS IS JUST A BALANCE, YOU KNOW, WE START AFTER WITH A DISTRICT THAT WAS TAILORED TOWARD STATE AND EISENHOWER THEN STARTED TO BROADEN THE UTILITY, WE MAKE THESE KIND OF DECISIONS MORE DIFFICULT OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE IT HAS DIFFERENT APPLICATIONS ELSEWHERE.  I THINK THE THOUSAND FOOT IS AN EXTREMELY LARGE BUFFER. THAT IS I THINK IT IS GOING TO BE PRETTY CONSERVATIVE AS FAR AS LIMITING THAT APPLICATION A WE BRING THAT DOWN THERE'S GOING TO BE A BIT MORE TO DO AND FIND AN ANALYSIS FOR YOUR COMFORT. I WOULD SAY IF THE DESIRE IS TO LOOK AT THAT, I THINK THAT SEEMS LIKE AN APPROPRIATE FRAMEWORK.
02:59:26.915: >> OKAY. SOUNDS GOOD TO ME. LIMITING IT TO NUMBERS THAT WE'RE SURE, PRETTY DARN SURE WE'RE ONLY GOING GOING TO GET IN STATE STREET CORRIDOR.
02:59:37.058: >> TO BE CLEAR, IF WE INCORPORATE THAT WE'RE GOING TO COMMUNICATE WATT WHAT THAT IMPACT - - WHAT THAT IMPACT LOOKS LIKE AS THIS PROGRESSES TO COUNCIL SO THEY'RE CLEARLY UNDERSTANDING WHERE THAT APPLIES.
02:59:52.607: >> ANY OBJECTIONS TO THAT ELEMENT? ANY, WE DID THIS BEFORE, BEFORE WE VOTE ON THIS, WE'RE VOTING ON AMENDED IT OR THREE TIMES THE GENERAL STATEMENT, THE INTENT STATEMENT, VERY FIRST SENTENCE. THE SECOND PART WAS - -
03:00:17.132: >> 15-FOOT â€”
03:00:18.066: >> YES, THAT'S RIGHT, MAXIMUM SETBACK, AND NOW ADDING AN ADDITIONAL HEIGHT THE INTENTION IS THAT IT ONLY REALLY APPLIES STATE AND EISENHOWER. AND THAT IT WOULD AT LEAST MY UNDERSTANDING IS WITHIN A THOUSAND, LIKE, IF YOU ARE MORE THAN A THOUSAND FEET FROM RESIDENTIAL BUT STILL WITHIN THE DISTRICT, YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO BUILD UP TO 300 FEET. OKAY. THAT GIVES US SOME WIGGLE ROOM TO FIND SOMETHING IN BETWEEN IF WE DETERMINE LATER ON TO COMMISSIONER MAPLE VILLAGE â€” COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT'S POINT THERE IS SOMETHING BETWEEN. ALL RIGHT. VERSION THAT WE'RE VOTING ON IS WITH NO ENUMERATION OF PLACES IN AS THE SPECIFIC INTENT STATEMENT.
03:01:12.554: >> DO COMMISSIONERS SAUVE AND MILSHTEYN AGREE WITH THOSE, YOU WERE THE MOVERS AND SUPPORTERS OF THAT, I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT'S CONSISTENT.
03:01:19.494: >> COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL, YOU HAD A QUESTION.
03:01:21.629: >> ARE WE VOTING ON JUST THESE THREE CHANGES FIRST AND THEN ON THE INTENT STATEMENT OR ARE WE DOING THIS ALL AT THE SAME TIME?
03:01:29.971: >> ALL AT THE SAME TIME.  THIS IS TO VOTE ON THE ORDINANCE AS DRAFTED WITH THESE CHANGES.
03:01:36.578: >> IF IT FAILS IS THERE AN OPPORTUNITY TO RECONSIDER RIGHT NOW?
03:01:41.649: >> IF THERE'S ANY QUESTION I GUESS I WOULD ASK THE COMMISSION TO TRY TO COME TO A RESOLUTION ON THE INTENT STATEMENT. IT SEEMS TEE ME THAT'S THE ONLY OUTSTANDING ISSUE.  I GUESS I'M HEARING MORE COMMISSIONERS THAT ARE OF THE MIND THOSE CORRIDORS SHOULD NOT BE INCLUDE, MEMO'S THE MORE APPROPRIATE PLACE TO DO THAT. I THINK THE EEZE OOHOSIS â€” I HAD HEARING MORE SUPPORT FOR THAT. IT MIGHT BE BETTER TO CONSIDER A MOTION TO MAKE THAT MODIFICATION, GIVE THE COMMISSION THE OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE ON WHETHER TO ADD THAT OR NOT, AND THEN THE TOTAL.
03:02:33.034: >> GOT IT. OKAY.
03:02:34.702: >> THREE THINGS WE TALK TALKED ABOUT BUT I FEEL DIFFERENTLY ABOUT THE INTENT STATEMENT AT THE FRONT SO I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SEPARATE THOSE THINGS OUT A LITTLE BIT.
03:02:43.077: >> YOU WOULD LIKE TO MOVE TO ADD THOSE CORRIDORS OF THE INTENT SECTION INTO THE INTENT STATEMENT?
03:02:48.917: >> SO WE CAN AT LEAST SEE WHERE WE LAND.
03:02:55.323: >> YES WOULD ANYBODY LIKE TO SECOND THAT MOTION? SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER DISCH. WE KIND OF DISCUSSED IT BEFORE, I THINK THIS IS FOR US TO SEE WHERE IT IS UNLS PEOPLE HAVE CLOSING THOUGHTS BEFORE WE VOTE. OKAY. DO YOU WANT JUST A VOICE VOTE?
03:03:12.941: >> IT'S UP TO YOU. A VOICE VOTE WOULD BE FINE, BUT I'M HAPPY TO ROLL CALL.
03:03:17.212: >> I THINK WE CAN JUST COUNT - - WE'LL RAISE OUR HANDS OR SAY YES. ALL IN FAVOR OF THE THE PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO ADD TO THOSE PLACES BACK IN, THAT PARAGRAPH C, PLEASE RAISE YOUR HAND OR SAY YES.
03:03:35.129: >> I SEE THREE.
03:03:36.564: >> I SEA THREE AS WELL. THAT ONE FAILED. SO WE'RE BACK TO THE MOTION THAT WE'VE AMENDED NOW THREE TIMES THE THREE AMENDMENTS BUT NOT WITH THE ENUMERATED PLACEMENT.
03:03:50.378: >> I'M PRESUMING THE REST OF THE COMMISSIONERS ARE DEFINITELY NAYS ON THAT. GREAT. BACK TO THE OR ELKFUL â€” ORIGINAL MOTION WITH THREE MODIFICATIONS DEEMED FRIENDLY ADDING PRIMARILY TO THE AMEANT IT, THE ADDITION INCREASING THE MAXIMUM SET BACK TO 15 FEET AND TO ADD AN ADDITIONAL HEIGHT LIMIT OF 300 FEET WHEN WHEN GREATER THAN 1,000 FEET FROM RESIDENTIALLY ZONED DISTRICTEDS.
03:04:20.275: >> YES.
03:04:28.616: >> COMMISSIONER MILL.
03:04:31.586: >> YES.
03:04:32.620: >> COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN.
03:04:34.055: >> YES.
03:04:34.489: >> COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL.
03:04:36.524: >> YES.
03:04:38.826: >> COMMISSIONER SAUVE.
03:04:40.928: >> YES.
03:04:42.664: >> COMMISSIONER ABRONS.
03:04:44.032: >> YES.
03:04:45.733: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT.
03:04:49.537: >> YES.
03:04:52.106: >> COMMISSIONER DISCH.
03:04:53.341: >> YES.
03:04:54.208: >> COMMISSIONER CLARKE.
03:04:54.742: >> YES.
03:04:55.009: >> CARRIES UNANIMOUSLY.
03:04:58.112: >> COMMISSIONER MILLS. OKAY, SO NOW THAT LEADS TO A SECOND THING BECAUSE THIS DOES NOT FULLY CAPTURE OUR REMIT TO COUNCIL WE HAVE A DEADLINE TO SEND IT BACK TO THEM.
03:05:12.760: >> THE SECOND PROPOSED MOTION AS I PRESENTED TO YOU AS A REMINDER WOULD BE THAT YOU RECOMMEND THE CITY COUNCIL THAT THE FOLLOWING GEOGRAPHIES BE PRIORITIZED FOR CITY INITIATED REZONING TO TC1 AND THAT YOU AS THE PLANNING COMMISSION INTEND TO INCORPORATE THIS INTO YOUR WORK PLAN. THIS IS YOU COMMUNICATING THAT THIS IS THE ORDER YOU INTEND TO DO IT AND YOU ARE GOING TO UNDERTAKE THAT WORK. I HAVE PRIORITIZED AHEAD OF TIME FOR YOU FIRST, SOUTH STATE, AND EISENHOWER, SECOND WOULD BE WASHTENAW AVENUE. THIRD WOULD BE WEST STADIUM AND MAPLE, AND FOURTH WOULD BE PLYMOUTH. THOSE ARE THE ONLY FOUR THAT I AM IN THE A PROPOSED MOTION FOR YOU TO CONSIDER THAT WOULD BE PRIORITIZED FOR CITY INITIATED AND I GUESS I WOULD AT THIS POINT IF YOU WOULD ENVISION ANY CHANGE TO THAT PRIORITIZATION OROMISSIONS, OR ADDITIONAL THAT ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THERE FOR CITY-INITIATED REZONING, YOU COULD MAKE THOSE MODIFICATIONS, AND ACCOMPANY THE PROPOSED AMENDMENT.
03:06:21.629: >> LET'S MOVE IT SO WE CAN DISCUSS IT. MOVED BY COMMISSIONER MILLS, SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER DISCH. DISCUSSION? I LIKE THIS ORDER, PERSONALLY. COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT.
03:06:34.876: >> WELL, SELFISHLY, I'M JUST CURIOUS HOW WILL YOU SLOT IT IN THE STADIUM ABOVE THAT?  I DON'T THINK THAT WAS ORIGINAL NAIL ON OUR LIST.  â€” ORIGINALLY ON OUR CELESTE EARN OPEN TO DISCUSSION WE'VE HAD - -
03:06:54.495: >> YEAH, OPEN TO DISCUSSION.  WE HAD PROPOSALS ON THE STADIUM THAT CAME TO MIND.  I WANT TO BE CLEAR, ALL OF THESE ARE BIG PROJECTS, I PROBABLY ENVISION TACKLING THESE ONE AT A TIME, BUT YOU'RE COMMITTING TO SORT OF PRIORITIZE THESE AND RESOURCE IT IN THE CONTEXT OF OTHER THINGS I WOULD SAY BOTH OF THOSE ARE PROBABLY GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD IF THIS IS ADOPTED.
03:07:25.660: >> THIS IS NOT HILL I'M GOING TO DIE ON. HOW LONG WOULD YOU SAY THE PROCESS YOU THINK WOULD TAKE TAKING, LIKE, WE START TOMORROW?
03:07:36.204: >> JUST IN LINE UNTIL EVERYBODY'S HAPPY WITH ALL OF THE PROPERTIES BEING REZONED.
03:07:40.341: >> OKAY, SO, LIKE, YEARS.
03:07:43.878: >> I WOULD, I MEAN, GENERALLY EACH ONE OF THESE IS PROBABLY A NINE-MONTH PROCESS, TO 12-MONTH PROCESS IF I HAD TO GUESS. WHAT DO YOU THINK, ALEXIS? AND JUST FOR COMPARISON, IT WAS PROBABLY ABOUT A SIX-MONTH PROCESS FOR A COUPLE OF CITY INITIATED REZONINGS WE DID ON HOOVER AND ASHLEY, SOUTH ASHLEY, THOSE ARE CITY-INITIATED, THOSE ARE MUCH SMALLER, AND THOSE PROBABLY STILL TOOK ALL TOLL ABOUT SIX MONTHS.
03:08:29.824: >> GOING FROM MULTIFAMILY TO SINGLE FAMILY TO ALLEVIATE SOME CONCERNS, BUT THE PROPERTY OWNERS WERE HAPPY IN NOT BEING ABLE TO MAKE CHANGES TO THEIR PROPERTIES.
03:08:43.905: >> YEAH. SO YEAH.  I THINK NINE MTHS IS PROBABLY A GOOD TARGET.
03:08:49.744: >> IT TAKES THREE MONTHS JUST TO DO PUBLIC NOTICES AND IF YOU RECALL ANY ORDINANCE INCLUDING A MAP AMENDMENT HAS TO HAVE A FIRST READING AND A SECOND READING AT COUNCIL. SOME OF THOSE ARE WORTH NOTICING AND THEN IT'S HOWEVER MANY ENGAGEMENT MEETINGS OR STAKEHOLDER OR OWNER MEETINGS THAT NEED TO BE ACCOMPLISHED SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT, SO THEN IT BECOMES A FUNCTION OF HOW MANY OWNERS ARE IN THE BATCH AND SO IT'S... I DON'T DISAGREE. YOU PROBAY SHOULD CSIR PARCELS ARE INCLUDN ANY ONE BATCH.
03:09:40.528: >> REGARDING THE MASTER PLAN IN BETWEEN NOW AND REZONING DUH THAT DO ANYTHING TO SPEED UP THE PROCESS?
03:09:48.903: >> POTENTIALLY.  FLUSH. I MEAN, POTENTIALLY, BUT IT'S STILL GOING TO BE ALLOWED BY PROPERTY OWNERS UNDERSTANDING WHAT THEY HAVE NOW, HOW THE USE OF THEIR PROPERTY IN THE FUTURE MIGHT CHANGE FROM THIS, SO I THINK.
03:10:03.050: >> I THINK SOME OF THE ENGAGEMENT MIGHT BE SHORTENED BECAUSE YOU WOULD PRESUME THEY WOULD BE PARTICIPATING IN THE MASTER PLANNING PROCESS ABOUT DEVELOPING THE RECOMMENDATIONS BLOT THERE'S STILL THE PROCEDURAL.
03:10:22.436: >> MAKES SENSE.
03:10:24.105: >> OTHER QUESTIONS, COMMENTS? REORDERING, ADDING TO THE LIST? THIS IS FOUR
