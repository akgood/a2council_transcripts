THIS IS DONE SIMPLY THROUGH A NOMINATION, A MOTION. THAT CAN BE MADE AND SUPPORTED BY MEMBERS OF THE COMMISSION. AND IT CAN BE DONE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS OR YOU CAN DO IT AS A SLATE OF CANDIDATES FOR ALL OF THE COMPENSATIONTIVE OFFICER OF THE COMMISSION, AS A REMINDER THE OFFICERS ARE THE CHAIR THE VICE CHAIR AND SECRETARY. CURRENTLY AS YOU KNOW THOSE ARE COMMISSIONER MILLS, COMMISSIONER RANDALL, AND COMMISSIONER ABRAMS RESPECTIVELY. I HAVE ASK THEM, THEY ARE WILLING TO SERVE IN CAPACITY FOR ANOTHER YEAR. THE DEBLAZIO DO BYLAWS DO ALLOW FOR A TWO YEAR TERM. AFTER THAT TWO YEARS IF THEY WERE REAPPOINTED NEW COMMISSIONERS WOULD HAVE TO FILL THOSE ROLES AT THE NEXT TIME. SO WITH THAT YOU CAN ENTERTAIN A MOTION OR IF OTHER INDIVIDUALS WOULD LIKE TO NOMINATE ANYONE ELSE THAT IS OF COURSE OKAY AS WELL.
00:13:37.283: >> COMMISSIONER MILLSTONE.
00:13:39.185: >> MOVE TO AAPPOINT OUR CHAIR VICE CHAIR AND SECRETARY FOR ANOTHER TERM.
00:13:46.292: >> MOVED BY COMMISSIONER SUV AND SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER LEE.

OKAY, MOTION CARRIES. ALRIGHTY. SO WE ARE NOW ON TO THE LAST PUBLIC COMMENT WHICH IS ITEM NUMBER 11, THIS IS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR PERSONS TO SPEAK UP TO THREE MINUTES ABOUT ANY ITEM OF INTEREST --
00:14:34.540: >> ONE MORE PUBLIC BUSINESS ITEM.
00:14:36.676: >> OH, SORRY I JUST SKIPPED RIGHT OVER THAT. HOW COULD I. ITEM TEN B WHICH IS OTHER BUSINESS. REVIEW OF THE BYLAWS.
00:14:46.352: >> AND JUST GIVE ME ONE MOMENT HERE. WELL, SINCE THIS IS MOSTLY TEXT ORIENT I CAN PROBABLY JUST PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE CHAINS. LET ME KNOW IF THE COMMISSIONERS WOULD LIKE ME TO PULL UP THE LANGUAGE AND I CAN DO THAT. ALSO IN THE CURRENT BYLAWS IT THE DIRECTS THE PLANNING COMMISSION TO REVIEW THE BYLAWS FOR PROPOSEDDED CHANGED OR JUST SORT OF AFFIRMATION OF THE BYLAWS AS APPROPRIATE AN AN ANNUAL BASIS. YOU WILL RECALL THAT WE MADE QUITE A NUMBER OF CHANGES TO THE BYLAWS LAST YEAR. TY CONFESS TO I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WITH THOSE SO THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ADOPTED BY CITY COUNCIL. BUT SINCE YOU HAVE ALREADY MADE THOSE CHANGES MY INTENTION WAS TO ROLL THOSE CHANGE AS WELL AS ANY ACTION YOU MAKE TONIGHT. SO WHAT YOU ARE SEEING ARE THE BYLAWS AS YOU PREVIOUSLY AMENDED THEM BUT NOT AS THEY CAN'TLY EXIST BECAUSE CITY COUNCIL HAS TO TAKE ACTION ON THOSE. THE ADDITIONAL PROPOSED CHANGES THAT I WOULD IF RECOMMEND AT THIS TIME ARE TO JUST ADD A COUPLE OF DEFINITIONAL REFERENCES SPECIFICALLY ADD CI.P. AS A REFERENCE TO THE CAPITOL IMPROVEMENTS PLAN. I PROPOSING THAT BECAUSE ANOTHER CHANGE THAT I'M ALSO PROPOSE IS TO STRIKE THE WORD MAST PLAN AND REPLACE IT WITH COMPREHENSIVE PLAN AND LIKEWISE GENERALLY REFER TO THAT DOCUMENT GOING FORWARD AS THE PLAN, SO MAKE SURER BETWEEN THE CIP AND THE PLAN BEING OUR COMPREHENSIVE PLAN VERSUS THE CAPITAL UP-TO-THE-MINUTE PRIVATES PLAN. THE CHANGE FROM CORN HE SAIDIVE PLAN HAS BEEN A COFFERS THAT HAS HAPPENED RECENTLY AT THE PLANNING COMMISSION ABOUT HOW THE TERM MASTER CAN HAVE VERY NEGATIVE CONNOTATIONS TO AMERICAN HISTORY AND A SENSE OF PATERNALISM, SO WHILE I'M ACKNOWLEDGING I'M STILL DOING ANY BEST TO CHANGE MY OWN TERMINOLOGY WHEN REFERRING TO IT I WOULD SUGGEST WE MODIFY OUR BYLAWS TO THAT ASPIRATION. THE NEXT PROPOSED CHANGE IS TO MODIFY OUR EXPECTED ATTENDANCE AT REGULARLY SCHEDULED MEETINGS. I HAVE [INDISCERNIBLE] THE LANGUAGE THAT WAS ADOPTED FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION AND THE CHANGES TO THAT ARE THAT IT NO LONGER REQUIRES THE CHAIR TO REPORT WHEN A MEMBER MISSES A CERTAIN CATEGORY MEETINGS BUT IT ALLOWS THE CHAIR TO REPORT IF NECESSARY OR IF DESIRED. AND THEN I ALSO MODIFIED THE NUMBERS AS THE PLANNING COMMISSION HAS MORE MEETINGS IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION TO BE A SLIGHTLY HIGHER STANDARD THAN THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION FROM A PERCENTAGE PERSPECTIVE BUT IT WOULD SAY THAT COMMISSIONER CAN'T MISS MAR THAN THREE CONSECUTIVE MEETINGS WITHOUT NOTICE OR SIX OR MORE MEETINGS IN ANY 12 MONTH PERIOD SEW THOSE WOULD BE SETTING THE THRESHOLD FOR THOSE AND THAT WOULD BE FOR -- WELL, THE THAT WOULD SET THAT NEW THRESHOLD. AND THEN AGAIN IT WOULD BE PER MISS I EVER FOR THE CHAIR TO REPORT AN ATTENDANCE ISSUE TO THE MAYOR BUT NOT DIRECTIVE FOR THE CHAIR TO DO SO. AND THEN LAST PROPOSED CHANGE THAT I AM PROPOSING IS IN THE STANDARD ORDER OF OUR AGENDA, I'M PROPOSING THAT WE STRIKE INSTRUCTIONS. WHILE IT DOESN'T TAKE A LOT OF TIME THERE'S NOTHING THAT STOPS US FROM MAKING AN INTRODUCTION AS PART OF AN GENTLED ITEM AND IT MIGHT JUST SAVE A BRIEF 35 SECONDS ON EVERY MEETING NUMBER OF OF ITEMS. SO THOSE ARE THE CHANGES I WOULD SUGGEST. IF YOU AGREE A MOTION WOULD BE IN ORDER TO ADOPT THEM AS PRESENTED AND THEN SCOUT'S HONOR GOING FORWARD IT WOULD BE PRESENTED TO CITY COUNCIL IN CONJUNCTION WITH YOUR PREVIOUS RECOMMENDED CHAINS FOR ADOPTION BY THE CITY COUNCIL.
00:19:06.846: >> ALRIGHTY. ANY QUESTIONS OR DISCUSSION? NO? ALRIGHTY. CAN I HAVE A MOTION TO APPROVE THE BYLAWS AS PRESENTED? MOVED BY COMMISSIONER MILLSTONE AND SENTED BY COMMISSIONER MILLS. ANY DISCUSSION OF THE PROPOSED MOTION? COMMISSIONER MILLS.
00:19:29.635: >> I WOULD JUST SAY THAT IREFUL APPRECIATE THE MOVE IN THE LANGUAGE FOR ATTENDANCE. I FEEL LIKE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IF EVER YEAR COMES UP AGAIN AND AGAIN AND SPEAKING AS THE CHAIR WHO HAS THE ATTENDANCE RESPONSIBILITY I APPRECIATE -- I LIKE -- I FEEL MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE WITH THIS LANGUAGE. ALSO I DO APPRECIATE HAVING REVIEWING THIS ONCE A YEAR JUST TO REMIND OURSELVES OF KIND OF WHAT'S IN IT. SO I'M GLAD THAT'S PART OF OUR ORDER.
00:20:06.472: >> ALRIGHTY. ANYONE ELSE? OKAY, ALL OF THOSE IN FAVOR OF THE MOTION PLEASE SAY AYE OR RAISE YOUR RIGHT HAND. LOOKS LIKE WE PASS THERE AND ANY OPPOSE? THE MOTION CARRIES. ALRIGHTY. ANY OTHER BUSINESS PROPOSEED? I PROPOSE THAT WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A -- HE'S TRYING.
00:20:39.238: >> WE HAVE ONE MORE PUBLIC COMMENT OPPORTUNITIES.
00:20:44.777: >> SO TO PUBLIC COMMENT NEXT, MR. LEONARD? ALL RIGHTY. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PERSONS TO SPEAK UP TO THREE MINUTES ABOUT ANY ITEM OF INTEREST. IF YOU WISH TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION AT THIS TIME USE THE RAISED HAND FEATURE,. CITY STAFF WILL SELECT CALRS THAT HAVE RAISED THEIR HAND USING THE LAST THREE DIGITSES OF YOUR FURNITURE OR BY NAME. YOU WILL HEAR AN AUTONATED ANNOUNCEME THAT THEOSTS LONG Y TOPEAK WHE SPEAKING PLEE MOVE TO A QUIET AREA AND MUTE. PLEASE TAKE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS AT THE BEGINNINGS OF YOUR COMMENTS. SEEMS LIKE WE HAVE A LISTENER BUT I DON'T SEE THEIR HAND RAISED.
00:21:40.065: >> LET'S JUST GIVE IT A MOMENT OR TWO IN CASE THEIR CONTEMPLATING THEIR THOUGHTS. GETTING THEIR THOUGHTS TOGETHER. AND I SEE NO INDICATION.
00:21:53.812: >>> OKAY, ALRIGHTY. SO THEN WE MOVE ON TO ITEM 12 WHICH IS COMMISSION PROPOSED BUSINESS. ANY COMMISSION PROPOSED BUSINESS? YES MR. LEONARD.
00:22:06.859: >> WE TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE THE MEETING GOT STARTED AND I WANTED TO ACKNOWLEDGE DEPENDING ON ACTION BY THE CITY COUNCIL THIS COULD BE [INDISCERNIBLE] HUSBAND TERM HAS ENDED AND HE IS IN THE BYLAWS SPECIFIED EXTENSION UNTIL HIS REPLACEMENT IS SPECIFIED. A REPLACEMENT HAS BEEN NOMINATED AT THIS WEEK'S CITY COUNCIL MEETING IF APPOINTED AT THE FINAL PLANNING COMMISSION MEETING THAT WOULD BE OCCURRING PRIOR TO OUR NEXT MEETING, SO I.D TO SHARE A BRIEF OVERVIEW. COMMISSIONER MILL STEIN HAS HAD A LONG RECORD OF PUBLIC SERVICE I'M SURE BEYOND WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SUMMARIZE BUT STARTING IN 2006 HE WAS SERVING ON THE BUILDING BOARD OF APPEALS. HE SERVED UNTIL 2011. FROM 2010 COSERVING ON THE BUILDING BOARD OF APPEALS TO THE ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS. SERVED FROM 2010 UNTIL 2016 AND AGAIN BECAUSE HE IS SUCH A BRIDGE BUILDER FROM 2000 TO 2021 HE HAS BEEN SERVING ON THIS BOARD OBVIOUSLY MOST RECENTLY PRIOR TO THE CURRENT YEAR AS CHAIR AS WELL. BASED ONLY MY SCIENTIFIC CALCULATIONS COMMISSIONER MILLSTONE HAS AEXTENDED ABOUT 418 MEETINGS OVER THAT TIME PERIOD. THAT WORKS OUT TO ABOUT EVERY NINE BUSINESS DAYS HE IS SPENDING HIS EVENING EITHER IN CITY COUNCIL CHAMBERS OR ON ZOOM DOING THE BUSINESS OF THE CITY ALONG WITH HIS COLLEAGUES. SO I WANTED TO SAY THAT I REALLY APPRECIATE HIS TIME ON THE COMMISSION, HE'S ALWAYS BEEN A GREAT RESOURCE AND SUPPORTIVE AND HAS OBVIOUSLY CONTRIBUTED TO MAKING THE CITY A BETTER PLACE. SO THANK YOU COMMISSIONER MILL STEINS.
00:24:11.950: >> ANYBODY ELSE? COMMISSIONER MILLS.
00:24:19.358: >> I'LL ADD THAT I FEEL LIKE COMMISSIONER MILL STEIN IS A TOUGH ACT TO FOLLOW IN TERMS OF CHAIR AND I LEARNED A LOT BY BEING AT THE TABLE, AND I FEEL LIKE WE STARTED AROUND THE SAME TIME IN 2012. BECAUSE I THINK WE TOOK OVER TERMS OF SOME OTHER PEOPLE, RIGHT? IT WAS 2014. EVEN SO THAT'S A LONG TIME AS I CAN ATTEST. AND I MEAN, YOU BROUGHT TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION TABLE THIS EXPERIENCE WITH THESE OTHER COMMISSIONS AND I CAN'T -- ESPECIALLY THE VOTE BOARD OF APPEAL HOW MANY TIMES THAT WAS USEFUL TO THE TABLE AND THAT EXPERIENCE IS GOING TO BE MISSED. SO I'M GLAD THAT YOU GET YOUR TUESDAY NIGHTS BACK AND THAT YOU'LL BE HEARING US FROM THE SIDELINES BE REALLY DO APPRECIATE ALL OF YOUR SERVICE AND THE LEADING THE WAY. SO THANK YOU.
00:25:20.486: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMER SCHMIDT.
00:25:24.523: >> [INDISCERNIBLE] WITH YOU BEING THE CHAIR AND THEN JUST ALL THE THOUGHTFUL THINGS THAT YOU WOULD ASK PETITIONERS, I LEARNED SO MUCH FROM LISTENING TO YOU SO I APPRECIATE THAT. AND HOPEFULLY WE'LL STILL GET TO SEE YOU AROUND. I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S BEEN SO LONG SINCE WE MET IN PERSON. WE CAN'T EVEN CELEBRATE YOU IN PERSON BUT HOPEFULLY SOON. ANYONE ELSE?
00:25:54.787: >> COMMISSIONER SUV.
00:25:57.856: >> I'LL JUST ADD THAT I HAVE THE UTMOST AREN'T FOR THE VOICE OF REASON YOU BRING TO A LOT OF THINGS AND I THINK YOU HOLD A
