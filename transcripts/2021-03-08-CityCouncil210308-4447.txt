00:00:22.679: >> Mayor Taylor: WELCOME TO THE MARCH 8 WORK SESSION OF THE ANN ARBOR CITY COUNCIL WHERE TODAY WE WILL BE TALKING ABOUT THE FISCAL YEAR '22-23 BUDGET WITH RESPECT TO THE PUBLIC SERVICES AND THE CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. MR. CRAWFORD, YOU HAVE THE COM.
00:00:39.497: >> City Admin. Crawford: MAYOR TONIGHT, AND NEXT IN OUR SERIES OF BUDGET DISCUSSIONS MR. POSTEMA WAS GOING TO GO FIRST. SO WE'LL HAVE HIM PRESENT HIS MATERIAL.
00:00:49.306: >> I THINK IT WAS THE REVERSE ORDER, MR. HUPY WAS GOING TO GO FIRST AND I WAS GOING TO BAT CLEANUP.
00:00:56.413: >> THAT IS FINE. THANK YOU, MAYOR AND COUNCIL FOR THE CHANCE TO PRESENT THE PUBLIC SERVICES AREA BUDGET AND STRATEGIC PLAN IMPLEMENTATION FOR '22 AND '23. WITH ME I HAVE MARTI PRASCHAN, OUR CHIEF OF STAFF. WE WILL DIVVY UP THE PRESENTATION. STARTING OFF WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF WHAT WE'RE GOING TO COVER, MARTHI WILL SHARE. WE'LL DO AN OVERVIEW OF THE BUDGET. WE'LLSTART OFF WITH THE FOOTBALL OVERVIEW AND THEN WE'LL MOVE INTO THE -- FINANCIAL OVERVIEW AND THEN WE'LL MOVE INTO THE STRATEGIC PLAN AND HOW THAT WILL MOVE FORWARD AND THEN THE HORIZON ISSUES. THE PUBLIC SERVICE AREA IS FIVE OPERATING UNITS, AND THEN THE ADMINISTRATION UNIT. ALSO ON THIS SLIDE, YOU WILL SEE THE CAPITAL PROJECTS WHICH IS SORT OF A PAPER UNIT. IT IS WHERE ALL THE CAPITAL PROJECTS AND THE EXPENDITURES FOR CAPITAL PROJECTS ARE ROUTED THROUGH. AS A TOTAL TO PUBLIC SERVICES AREA, HAS ABOUT 225 FTEs. AND MARTI WILL LEAD US THROUGH THE FINANCIAL PORTION. YOU ARE ON MUTE, MARTI.
00:02:38.716: >> GOOD EVENING. AS MR. HUPY MENTIONED, I'M MARTI PRASCHAN, CHIEF OF STAFF OF THE PUBLIC SERVICES AREA AND THIS EVENING, I WILL PRESENT THE MAJOR FUNDS MANAGED BY THE PUBLIC SERVICES AREA. THAT BEING SAID, PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT THESE PLANS AND MODELS REPRESENT INFORMATION THAT WE HAD AT THE TIME OF BUDGET PREPARATION. THEREFORE, IT'S A SNAPSHOT IN TIME. THESE MODELS ARE UPDATED WHEN WE HAVE NEW INFORMATION OR SITUATIONS CHANGE. SO JUST KEEP THAT IN MIND. THE FIRST AREA WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT IS THE WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM FUND. YOU WILL NOTICE A CHART IN THE UPPER PORTION OF THE SLIDE THAT REFLECTS THE PLANNED USE OF FUND BALANCE AND YOU WILL SEE THE BLACK LINE HERE REPRESENTS OUR TARGET FUND BALANCE, WHICH IS 25% OF OPERATING EXPENSES WHICH IS ABOUT $4 MILLION. YOU WILL SEE THAT WE HAVE A PLANNED USE OF FUND BALANCE AND THIS PLANNED USE IS IN ACCORDANCE, WHICH YOU WILL SEE FURTHER ON BELOW IS OUR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS PLAN. AS WE MOVE TO THE BOTTOM LEFT OF THE SLIDE, YOU WILL SEE A CHART REPRESENTING THE CASH FLOWS OF THE FUND. BY FISCAL YEAR '23, YOU CAN SEE THAT WE'LL BE SPENDING ALL OF OUR INCOMING REVENUE TO SUPPORT OPERATIONS AND OUR CAPITAL PLAN. AT THIS POINT IS WHERE WE WOULD START ISSUING DEBT NO TO -- IN ORDER TO COMPLETE OUR FULL C.I.P. PLAN. AND THEN MOVING ON OVER TO THE LEFT, AS I MENTIONED IN OUR CURRENT CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS PLAN THAT WAS RECENTLY UPDATED FOR THE WATER FUND AND ALL OF OUR FUNDS. YOU CAN SEE WE'RE RUNNING A ABOUT $20 MILLION IN CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS ANNUALLY, UNTIL WE START HITTING FISCAL YEAR '23/24 AND THIS IS REFLECTIVE OF THE WATER TREATMENT REPLACEMENT PROJECT. IT'S A LARGE-SCALE PROJECT THAT WILL SPAN NUMEROUS FISCAL YEARS AND THE CURRENT BUDGET FOR THAT PROJECT IS $108 MILLION. NEXT UP THE SEWAGE DISPOSAL FUND. AGAIN THE TOP PORTION OF THE SLIDE IS REPRESENTING OUR PLANNED USE OF FUND BALANCE. AGAIN, YOU WILL SEE THE SOLID BLACK LINE REPRESENTING OUR TARGET FUND BALANCE IS, AGAIN, 25% OF OPERATING EXPENSES, WHICH IN THE SANITARY SEWER FUND IS ABOUT 1.8 -- JUST UNDER $2 MILLION. THAT POLICY IS SET -- IS A CITY POLICY THAT'S SET BASED ON BEST PRACTICES AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE CITY'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR. ON THE LOWER LEFT-HAND PORTION OF THE SLIDE, AGAIN, YOU WILL SEE CASH IN, WHICH IS OUR -- MOSTLY OUR RATE REVENUE DOLLARS AND THE CASH OUT, WHAT WE PLAN TO SPEND. AGAIN, YOU SEE THE LINES MEET IN FISCAL YEAR '24, AND '24 IS WHERE WE PLAN TO ISSUE DEBT TO COMPLETE OUR CAPITAL PROJECTS. OF NOTE IN THIS FUND, PLEASE NOTE THAT WE WILL SEE IN '21 AND '22, INCREASED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES RELATED TO LINING OF OUR SYSTEM AS WELL AS CLEANING AND REPLACEMENT. THESE CAPITAL PROJECTS ARE IN LINE WITH OUR ADMINISTRATIVE CONSENT ORDER. YOU WILL ALSO SEE OVER IN '24 AND '25 WHERE WE START TO PULL IN SOME PROJECTS FROM THE PLANT, THE WATER TREATMENT PLANT. WE ARE PLANNING TO REPLACE A SCREENING SYSTEM AND CONTINUE OUR LIFT STATION REPLACEMENT PROJECT. NEXT UP, WE HAVE THE STORMWATER FUND AND, AGAIN, YOU WILL SEE A THEME OF US HAVING A PLAN TO SPEND DOWN OUR FUND BALANCE OF FISCAL YEAR '24 TO OUR TARGET OR ABOUT $1.5 MILLION. YOU WILL SEE THE SAME AND IN THE CASH FLOW WE HAVE CASH OUT EXCEEDING OUR REVENUE STREAM AND THEN WE KIND OF -- WHERE WE TOUCH HERE IS WHERE WE PLAN TO ISSUE DEBT TO FINANCE OUR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS PLAN. ON THE BOTTOM RIGHT, YOU WILL SEE THE PLAN FOR THE STORMWATER FUND AND YOU WILL NOTICE QUITE A SPIKE HERE IN FISCAL YEAR '24. THAT IS DUE TO SOME PLANNED PROJECTS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE SOLID -- OR THE SOLID -- PART ME, THE STORM WATT FUND MANAGEMENT FUND -- WATER MANAGEMENT FUND TO FIX SOME DRAINAGE ISSUES. NEXT SLIDE UP WILL INDICATE YOU TO OUR PLANNED RATE INCREASES FOR THE UTILITY FUNDS. IN COORDINATION WITH OR UTILITY FUND MODELS OUR RATE PLANS ARE DEVELOPED. OUR FISCAL YEAR '22 IMPACTS TO THE AVERAGE RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMER IS AN OVERALL INCREASE OF ABOUT $6.69 PER QUARTER, OR $26.76 ANNUALLY. WHICH IS JUST UNDER A 3% INCREASE TO THE AVERAGE RESIDENTIAL HOMEOWNER OR SYSTEM USER. THE CHART ON THE BOTTOM REFLECTS OUR RATE PLAN THROUGH FISCAL YEAR '26. PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THAT WE REEVALUATE THIS PLAN ANNUALLY. YOU WILL SEE A STEADY INCREASE ANTICIPATED FOR THE WATER FUND TO ADDRESS CAPITAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, HOWEVER, WE ARE PROJECTING NO INCREASES THROUGH FISCAL YEAR '24 ON THE SANITARY SEWER SIDE AND THEN WE WILL RETURN TO ABOUT INFLATION LEVELS IN '25 AND '26. AND IN THE STORMWATER FUND, WE ARE IN OUR LAST YEAR OF OUR FIVE-YEAR PLANNED RATE INCREASE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE 2018 LEVEL OF SERVICE STUDY. SO ONCE WE GET PAST FISCAL YEAR '20, WE WILL BE AROUND THE RATE OF INFLATION PLANNED FOR RATE INCREASES IN THE STORMWATER FUND. TO YOU WE'RE MOVING ON TO OUR RIGHT-OF-WAY AND ROAD MAINTENANCE FUNDS. FIRST UP WE HAVE THE MAJOR AND LOCAL STREET FUNDS WHICH WE COMBINED INTO ONE SLIDE. THE MAJOR STREET AND LOCAL STREET FUNDS ARE SUPPORTED BY THE PUBLIC ACT IN GASOLINE TAX DOLLARS. YOU CAN SEE THE COMBINED FUND BALANCE AS OF JUNE 30th EACH YEAR HERE, THE GREEN PORTION INDICATING THE MAJOR STREET FUND PORTION AND THE BLUE PORTION THE LOCAL STREET FUND BALANCE. AGAIN, THE TARGET IN THIS FUND HAPPENS TO BE ONE YEAR OF AT 51 WEIGHT AND GAS TAX ANNUAL REVENUES. SO THAT'S ABOUT $13 MILLION AGAIN, BROKEN UP BY MAJOR AND LOCAL STREET FUNDS. AGAIN, THE CURRENT PLAN, AGAIN, YOU WILL SEE REFLECTS A PLAN SPEND DOWN OF FUND BALANCE TO -- IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR CAPITAL MAINTENANCE PROJECTS INCLUDING PROJECTS THAT SUPPORT PAVEMENT ASSET MANAGEMENT GOALS AND TRAFFIC SYSTEM ENHANCEMENTS. MOVING ON OVER TO THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE SCREEN, YOU SEE THE CHART THAT REPRESENTS THE ORANGE LINE, THE REVENUES COMING IN AND YOU WILL SEE THE BLUE LINE REPRESENTING EXPENDITURES. YOU SEE QUITE A DIP HERE IN FISCAL YEAR '19. WE HAD SOME ONE-TIME REVENUE FROM THE STATE OF MICHIGAN, AND THEN IN FISCAL YEAR '19 IS WHERE WE STARTED TO SEE SOME IMPACTS OF CONTRACTOR CAPACITY ISSUES AND ALSO CONSTRUCTION SEASON HAPPENS TO LAND RIGHT AT THE END OF OUR FISCAL YEAR. CONTRACTOR CAPACITIES OR WEATHER ISSUES GETS MOVED OVER INTO THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR AND YOU SEE THAT HAPPENS IN FISCAL YEAR '20 AS WELL AND YOU SEE SOME SPIKES IN '21 AS WE EXPECT TO SPEND DOWN AND FINALIZE THOSE PROJECTS. AS WE MOVE OUT TO FISCAL YEAR 2 AND ' OURXPENSESRE EXEDIN OUR REVENUESY BIT. THE BOTTOM PORTION OF THE SLIDE, YOU WILL SEE A PIE CHART THAT REPRESENTS HOW THE FUNDS ARE SPENT. YOU WILL SEE THE LARGEST PORTION OR PIECE OF THE PIE IS SPENT ON RIGHT-OF-WAY MAINTENANCE, WHICH INCLUDES THINGS SUCH AS SNOWPLOWING, POT POTHOLE FILLIND SURFACE MAINTENANCE OF THE PAVEMENT. AND THE THIRD LARGEST CATEGORY IS TRAFFIC CONTROL, WHICH INCLUDES SIGNS AND SIGNALS NOT ONLY FOR VEHICLE TRAFFIC BUT PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC AS WELL. AND THEN NEXT UP IS THE OTHER CATEGORY WHICH WILL INCLUDE THINGS SUCH AS ADMINISTRATION, AND CUSTOMER SERVICE AND SOME RETIREE HEALTHCARE COSTS. WE ALSO HAVE DEBT IN THIS FUND. AND THIS FUND IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE BROADWAY BRIDGES PROJECT AS WELL AS A PORTION  OF THE WHEELR MAINTENANCE FACILITY AND THEN THE 4% THAT'S LABELED ALTERNATIVE TRANSPORTATION, IT SHES ONLY TO THE PORTION OF ACT 51 REVENUE THAT'S AUTOMATICALLY TRANSFERRED TO THE ALTERNATIVE TRANSPORTATION FUND, WHICH IS ABOUT $600,000 ANNUALLY OR 5% OF WEIGHT AND GAS TAX. SO THAT PIECE OF THE PIE WOULD NOT INCLUDE ANY OTHER -- ANY OTHER EFFORTS OR ACTIVITIES AMONG THESE OTHER CATEGORIES THAT SUPPORT PEDESTRIAN -- PEDESTRIAN OR NON-MOTORIZED ACTIVITIES SUCH AS THE -- THE R.F.B.s, THE B PEDESTRIAN CROSSINGS AND THE CROSSWALK IMPROVEMENTS. NEXT UP IS OUR STREET TO BRIDGE AND SIDEWALK MILLAGE FUND. AT THE TOP, AGAIN, YOU WILL SEE OUR FUND BALANCE IS ABOUT $5.5 MILLION AND OUR TARGET IS ACTUALLY ONE YEAR -- PARDON ME, HALF A YEAR OF STREET MILLAGE REVENUE. YOU WILL SEE THAT WE ACTUALLY ARE PROJECTING AN INCREASE IN THE TARGET AREA -- PARDON ME, IN THE FUND BALANCE TO ADDRESS SOME CAPITAL NEEDS THAT YOU WILL SEE LATER ON IN OUR CAPITAL PLAN. AGAIN, TO THE RIGHT, YOU WILL SEE EXPENDITURES VERSUS REVENUE AND YOU CAN SEE PRETTY MUCH WE'RE IN LINE WITH, YOU KNOW, SPENDING WHAT IT IS WE BRING IN ON CAPITAL PROJECTS. BUT YOU WILL SEE IN FISCAL YEAR '21 AN INCREASE IN EXPENSE AND, AGAIN, THIS IS DUE TO SOME BLEED OVER OF CONTRACTOR CAPACITY ISSUES ON THE ROAD MAINTENANCE SIDE. AND ON THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN, AGAIN THE PIE CHART REPRESENTING HOW THE FUND IS SPENT. SO THE MAJORITY OF STREET BRIDGE AND SIDEWALK MILLAGE IS SPENT ON RESURFACING AND CAPITAL MAINTENANCE. NEXT UP IS ROAD PROJECTS WHICH WOULD BE RECONSTRUCTION OF ROADS. AND BRIDGE AND CAPITAL MAINTENANCE. WE DO SOME MAINTENANCE PROJECTS ON -- SOME CAPITAL MAINTENANCE AND BRIDGE OUT OF THIS FUND AS WELL AS THE SIDEWALK RAMP AND REPAIR PROJECT AND, AGAIN, THIS IS JUST THE PORTION THAT SUPPORTS THE ANNUAL PROGRAM. OF THIS WOULDN'T INCLUDE ANY SIDEWALK AND RAMP REPAIRS OR FOR THAT MATTER CROSSWALK ROUTES THAT ARE INCLUDED AS PART OF THE ANNUAL MAINTENANCE OR THE ANNUAL RESURFACING PROJECTS OR THE ROAD PROJECTS. AGAIN, THE OTHER CATEGORY WE INCLUDED ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND RETIREE COSTS. AND THE LAST FUND WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS EVENING IS THE SOLID WASTE FUND. I WILL TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO REMIND YOU OF THE FACT THAT THE PLAN AND BUDGET ARE DEVELOPED WITH THE INFORMATION THAT IS AVAILABLE AT THE TIME, WHICH IN THIS CASE WAS LATE DECEMBER, EARLY JULY. SPECIFICALLY, FOR THIS FUND, I'M REFERRING TO THE CONTRACT FOR COLLECTIONS, RECYCLE COLLECTIONS. IT WAS STILL IN NEGOTIATIONS. IT WAS A SIGNIFICANT CONTRACT TO THE FUND AND WHAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE AWARE OF IN THIS PARTICULAR INSTANCE WE ASSUMED NO CONTRACT SAVINGS BECAUSE NEGOTIATIONS WERE STILL ONGOING. KEEP THAT IN MIND AS I MOVE FORWARD IN THIS CONVERSATION THAT WE AREN'T ANTICIPATING ANY SAVINGS THERE. AS NEGOTIATIONS ARE FINALIZED AND C COUNCIL FINALIZED FINAL CONTRACT IMPROVEMENTS, THOSE CHANGES WILL BE ROLLED INTO THE MODEL. YOU WILL NOTICE AGAIN A HEALTHY FUND BALANCE IN THE S SOLID WASE FUNDS WITH THE TARGET BEING AT 25% OF OPERATING COSTS. AGAIN, YOU WILL NOTICE BY FISCAL YEAR '23 WE ARE SLIGHTLY UNDER THAT TARGET, AGAIN ASSUMING NO CONTRACT SAVINGS IN OUR COLLECTION CONTRACTS. AND, AGAIN, YOU WILL SEE OVER ON THE RIGHT, THE EXPENSES ON THE BLUE LINE, REVENUE ON THE ORANGE LINE AND, AGAIN, YOU WILL SEE OUR ANNUAL EXPENSES BEGIN TO EXCEED WHAT WE'RE BRINGING IN, AND OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE SPENT DOWN OUR FUND BALANCE, THEREFORE, THE SITUATION WOULDN'T BE SUSTAINABLE IN THIS MANNER, HOWEVER WE ANTICIPATE SOME CONTRACT SAVINGS ON THAT COLLECTION CONTRACT. AGAIN, THE PIE CHART ON THE BOTTOM OF THE PAGE SHOWS A ABOUT 550/50 SPLIT FOR WASTE SERVICES TO MATERIAL RECOVERY SERVICES. WE ALSO IN THIS FUND SUPPORT THE COMPOST SELECTION AND IN THIS CASE, PUBLIC WORKS HAS PUT INTO THEIR BUDGET THIS YEAR INCREASED COMPOST COLLECTIONS BOTH BY VOLUME AND BY THE PERIOD THAT THEY ARE COVERING. SO THEY ARE ADDING THE DECEMBER THROUGH APRIL PERIOD HERE. AGAIN, THIS FUND HAS ITS OWN DEPRECIATION AND OPEB AND GASB REQUIREMENTS, AS WELL AS THIS OTHER CATEGORY, WHICH INCLUDES THINGS SUCH AS CUSTOMER SERVICE, SUSTAINABILITY, LANDFILL MAINTENANCE, AS WELL AS ADMINISTRATION. SO AT THIS POINT, I WILL TURN IT BACK OVER TO CRAIG UNLESS YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR ME.
00:17:09.919: >> City Admin. Crawford: MAYOR, BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO MR. HUPY, BECAUSE THE AMOUNT OF MATERIAL WE HAVE, IT MAY BE USEFUL TO SEE IF COUNCIL HAS QUESTIONS AS WE GO THROUGH THIS PRESENTATION, IF THAT'S YOUR -- IF THAT'S OKAY WITH YOU.
00:17:21.097: >> Mayor Taylor: I WILL BE GUIDED BY YOU.
00:17:25.468: >> THANK YOU. NOW, FOR THE NEXT 30 SLIDES, YOU GET TO LISTEN TO ME DRONE ON ABOUT THE WORDS ON THE SCREEN, AND I WILL NOT REALLY READ EACH WORD. WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS HIT THE HIGHLIGHTS AND IF THERE'S SOMETHING YOU HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT, PLEASE, PLEASE ASK IT. THIS IS NOT A TEST OF ENDURANCE FOR YOU LISTENING TO ME READ OFF OF A SLIDE. SO ON THE DRAFT STRATEGIC PLAN, THE GOALS ARE SHOWN AND AS YOU HAVE SEEN IN OTHER PRESENTATIONS, THEY ARE -- THEY ARE THERE. THE THREE THAT REALLY HIT PUBLIC SERVICES IS THE DIVERSE EQUITABLE INCLUSION -- INCLUSIVE COMMUNITY, ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDS AND A WELL-MAINTAINED AND SUSTAINABLE INFRASTRUCTURE. SO WE WILL EMPHASIZE THAT AS WE GO THROUGH THE NEXT SLIDES, AND ALSO THE REMINDER OF THE IMPACT. STAFF IMPACTS REFLECT THE IMPACT TO SERVICES. IT IS OUR SERVICES ARE DELIVERED BY OUR STAFF. ADMINISTRATION IS THE FIRST AREA THAT WE WILL COVER. AS ADMINISTRATION IN THE PUBLIC SERVICES, WE ARE CHARGED WITH PRUDENTLY MANAGING OUR FINANCES AND TWO OF THE MEASURES FOR THAT IS OUR BOND RATINGS. OUR WATER BOND RATING OF AA OR BETTER AND OUR WASTEWATER RATING OF AA PLUS. GOING FORWARD, THERE ARE NO RESOURCES -- ADDITIONAL RESOURCES REQUESTED IN THIS BUDGET FOR ADMINISTRATION. THE CORE SERVICES, I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT SAFETY TRAINING, OUR EMPLOYEES IS VERY IMPORTANT. RELIABILITY OF OUR REVENUE PROJECTIONS, OUR MODELS FOR OUR FINANCIAL MODELS ARE IMPORTANT AND WE WANT TO BE WITHIN 90% OF BUDGETS AS WE GO FORWARD. ALSO WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN 1.25 DEBT COVERAGE RATIO BY -- FOR BOTH OUR WATER AND SEWER BONDS. SO OUR RATES HAVE TO BE ESTABLISHED TO COVER THAT. AND ALSO, WE WANT TO BE A BEST PRACTICES ORGANIZATION AND OUR GOAL IS TO ACHIEVE 75 PERCENTALE IN AWWA'S ORGANIZATIONAL BEST PRACTICES. NEXT. THE IMPACTS AS WE GO FORWARD, THERE IS A REDUCTION IN SUPPORT TO THE PUBLIC ART THAT IS FOLLOWING THE CUTS IN THE GENERAL FUND AS THAT SUPPORT COMES OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND. WE WILL BE INCREASING OUR SUPPORT FOR PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT AND COMMUNICATIONS REFLECTIVE OF THE INCLUSIVE COMMUNITY GOAL. NEXT -- OR NEXT FUNCTION UNIT WE'LL BE LOOKING AT IS THE ENGINEERING UNIT. ONE OF THEIR PRIMARY GOALS IS VISION ZERO AS WE GO FORWARD. AND AS WE STRIVE TO REACH VISION ZERO IS BY 2023, HAVING LESS THAN FIVE INCAPACITATING INJURIES OR FATALITIES IN THE SYSTEM. TO GIVE YOU BACKGROUND FOR THAT, PRECOVID, AS A COMMUNITY, WE WERE SUFFERING 20 TO 30 INCAPACITATING INJURIES OR FATALITIES A YEAR. ALSO, THE BOTTOM BULLETS ON THIS SLIDE REFLECT OUR COMMITMENT TO TRANSPORTATION ALTERNATIVE TRANSPORTATION, COMPLETING THE NEAR TERM SIDEWALK GAPS AS IDENTIFIED IN THE TRANSPORTATION PLAN, INSTALLING NEW CROSSWALKS AND ALSO INSTALLING ADDITIONAL BIKE LANES OR LOW STRESS BIKE NETWORK. ALSO ON THE SLIDE IS THE AAATA GOAL OF 15-MINUTE EFFECTIVE FREQUENCY THROUGHOUT THE DAY ON MAJOR CORRIDORS. IMPACTS TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL IS ON THE VISION ZERO. WE DON'T HAVE A NUMBER -- OR WE DIDN'T HAVE A NUMBER CALCULATED BACK IN DECEMBER, JANUARY AS THESE SLIDES WERE BEING PUT TOGETHER. BUT AS WE GO THROUGH THE TRANSPORTATION MASTER PLAN AND WE TAKE THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS AND DEVELOP COSTS, WE'LL BE INCORPORATING THAT INTO THE PLAN. THE NEAR TERM SIDEWALK GAPS WILL BE $16 TO $21 MILLION AS WE INSTALL THOSE. CROSSWALKS WILL BE ABOUT $60,000. ENGINEERING CORE SERVICES, T GOAL FOR THE ENGINEERING UNIT IS TO COMPLETE 90% OF THE CAPITAL PROJECTS ON TIME. ENSURE THAT THE ROADS ARE PATCHED BY PRIVATE CONTRACTORS WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THEM BEING OPENED, AND THE GOAL WHICH WE -- YOU HAVE HEARD BEFORE FROM US AS GOOD OR BETTER FOR 80% OF THE STREETS BY 2026. FOR THE TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING GROUP, THE RESPONDING TO 100% OF THE A2FIXIT REQUESTS WITHIN A QUARTER. AND THAT MAY SEEM A LITTLE LONG, BUT UNDERSTAND SOME OF THOSE REQUESTS ARE TRAFFIC CONTROL ITEMS SUCH AS SIGNS, SIGNAL CHANGES, ET CETERA. SO SOME HAVE FAIRLY LONG LEAD TIMES. AND THE OTHER TWO GOALS RELATE TO PROCESSING TRAFFIC REVIEWS AND TRAFFIC CONTROL ORDERS. THE PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT, THE GOALS LISTED THERE ARE PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD. AND UNDER THE STREETLIGHTS, THE GOAL AS WE CURRENTLY HAVE IT IS 100% OF OUTAGES OF 72 HOURS, IF A MISDEED CLEARANCE IS NEEDED. MANY TIMES THEY ARE NOT NEEDED. AND TO CONTINUE THE MIGRATIONS OF OUR SIGNS, SIGNALS AND STREETLIGHTS WORKFLOW MANAGEMENT OVER TO CITY WORKS. THE IMPACTS TO ACHIEVE THOSE CORE SERVICES. THERE IS A REDUCTION IN THE GENERAL FUND OF $126,000 FOR THE STREETLIGHT REPLACEMENT PROGRAM. WE ARE ASKING FOR AN ADDITIONAL FTE TO HANDLE THE STREETLIGHT, SIGN SIGNALS, SMART CITY. AS WE LOOK AT OUR STREETLIGHTS AND MANAGE THEM MORE AS AN ASSET SYSTEM CATEGORY, WE NEED ADDITIONAL STAFF TO KEEP TRACK OF THAT AND KEEP US ON SCHEDULE. ANTICIPATED ADDITIONAL ELECTRICITY. AS WE HAVE INSTALLED NEW STREETLIGHTS, THE IMPACT OF THAT IS $30,000 A YEAR IN ADDITIONAL ELECTRICITY. THE INCREASED IN ANNUAL STREETLIGHT MAINTENANCE, THAT'S AN OFFSET FOR THE LINE UP ABOVE, WHERE INSTEAD OF CHARGING GENERAL FUND, WE WILL BE PROPOSING TO TAKE IT OUT OF THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH, PEDESTRIAN SAFETY BUCKET. WE WILL BE REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF MONEY WE HAVE BEEN PUTTING FORWARD FOR SCHOOL SAFETY, ELECTRONIC SPEED SIGNS AND FLASHING BALLS AS ALL OF THOSE ARE ON MAJOR STREETS AND THEY HAVE BEEN INSTALLED PRIOR TO THIS BUDGET. SO WE CAN START TO RAMP THAT EFFORT DOWN. NOT NEEDING ADDITIONAL INSTALLATIONS. AND THEN VISION ZERO MARKETING AS WE RAMP UP VISION ZERO AND DO THE EDUCATION. HEALTHY STREETS TO BE DETERMINED DETERMINED. SHORTLY WE WILL BE IN FRONT OF COUNCIL ON HEALTHY STREETS AND AS WE DO THAT, WE WILL BE ESTABLISHING WHAT THE COSTS ARE GOING FORWARD. TALK ABOUT SUPPORTING SUSTAINABILITY AS WE CONVERT TO ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND GREENER FLEETS, THERE IS A COST TO THAT ANNUALLY. THAT'S WHAT'S REPRESENTED ORDINATED INTELLIGENCE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM STRATEGY DEVELOPMENT. AND I HAD TO ASK MY STAFF AS TO ALL RIGHT, WHAT DID THAT BUNDLE OF WORDS REALLY MEAN? WHAT IT IS, IS AS WE GO FORWARD WITH OUR INTELLIGENCE TRAFFIC SIGNALS, OUR SCOOT SYSTEMS, THE STATE HAS THEIR SYSTEM, COUNTY HAS THEIR SYSTEM. WE ARE STARTING TO IN R ENGAGE IN SMART CITY APPLICATIONS. THIS WILL ALLOW ALL OF THESE SYSTEMS TO WORK IN A COORDINATED MANNER. SOFTWARE LICENSES ARE PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD AND WE WILL BE FUNDING THIS OUT OF ACT 51 REVENUE. PUBLIC WORKS, STRATEGIC OVERVIEWS LOOKING AT ACHIEVING ACHIEVING A 43% DIVERSION RATE IN 2023 AND INCREASING THE DIVERSION OF ORGANICS WASTE UP TO 20%. THE IMPACTS TO ACHIEVE THOSE OBJECTIVES, THE FIRST TWO ITEMS COME TO ABOUT $2.5 MILLION. THAT WOULD BE THE COMMERCIAL COMPOST AND THE MULTIFAMILY COMPOST AS WE GO FORWARD WITH THOSE NEW PROGRAMS AND INFALLING THEM. THAT'S AN ESTIMATED COST. AS A SAID EARLIER, THE ELECTRIC VEHICLES TO SUPPORT SUSTAINABILITY HAS A CHARGE TO THIS OPERATION ALSO. YEAR ROUND RESIDENTIAL COMPOST IS $99,000. AND JUMPING DOWN TO DROPOFF CENTER, THAT COMES TO $2.4 MILLION. THAT WOULD BE A REGIONAL DROPOFF CENTER IF WE HAVE OUR PARTNERS ALIGNED AND GOING FORWARD WITH IT. RIGHT NOW SERVICES AT THE DROPOFF CENTER ON LESS THAN 50% OF IT ARE CITY RESIDENTS USING IT. SO WE -- AS WE GO FORWARD AND NEEDING TO DEVELOP A FULL-TIME DROPOFF CENTER, WE HAVE TO HAVE PARTNERS TO GO FORWARD WITH THAT. THE ONLY OTHER ONE I WOULD MENTION IS STUDENT MOVE-IN AND MOVE-OUT. THAT PROGRAM IS GOING THROUGH CHANGES RIGHT NOW PREVIOUSLY WE USED TO DO IT ON A STREET AND HILL AND TAPPAN AREA. AND IT IT WAS NOT SUSTAINABLE THERE AND OUR VENDOR, RAA, THE ONLY BIDDER ON THAT SERVICE HAS DECLINED TO UNDERTAKE THE SERVICE ANYMORE. LAST YEAR WE DID IT ON THE FINGERLY SITE. U OF M HAS NOT INVITED US BACK THERE FOR THIS COMING MOVE-OUT, MOVE-IN THIS SPRING. SO WE ARE STILL LOOKING FOR A SITE TO HOST THAT AND STAY TUNED. CORE SERVICES IN PUBLIC WORKS. OUR GOAL IS TO SWEEP EACH BIKE LANE WEEKLY. WE SWEEP THE STREETS TWO TIMES IN THE FALL AND 90% OF THE POTHOLES ARE PATCHED WITHIN 72 HOURS. FROM A SANITARY AND WATER SLIDE, SIDE -- THE BLOCKAGES CAUSE BACKUPS. REPLACE 40 WATER VALVES ANNUALLY. CLEAN 20% OR A FIFTH OF OUR LARGE STORM SEWER SYSTEM ANNUALLY. AND DO INSPECTION OF OUR CROSS LOT SEWERS. THOSE ARE THE SEWERS THAT RUN BEHIND HOUSES, THROUGH THE WOODS, ET CETERA. 50% OF THOSE EACH YEAR. SOLID WASTE, THE GOAL IS TO INCREASE SPECIAL RECYCLING 5% ANNUALLY. 99% OF THE RESIDENTIAL TRASH SERVICES IS COMPLETED ON SCHEDULE. AND CONTINUE TO DECREASE THE PERCENTAGE OF OUR MATERIALS LAND SKILLED RELATIVE TO THE ENTIRE WASTE STREAM FROM THE STATE INDUSTRY, PRUNE 10% OF OUR TRUES ANNUALLY AND THEN CONTINUE WITH THE 1,000 PLANTINGS EACH YEAR WITHIN THE RIGHT-OF-WAY. PUBLIC WORKS CONTINUING STILL ON THE TREATED, THE FIRST TWO ITEMS ARE CONTINUING OUR MOVE TO SALT BRYN APPLICATION INSTEAD OF USING ROCK SALT. I JUMP DOWN TO THE INCREASED VEHICLE COSTS AS WE SUPPORT ELECELECTRIC VEHICLES AND GREEN FLEETS. AS WE ESTABLISH OUR BIKE LANES AND BIKE TRACKS, WE HAVE TO INCREASE OUR MAINTENANCE EXPENSES FOR THOSE, TO MAINTAIN THEM. ALL OF THESE WILL BE OFFSET BY THE ACT 51 REVENUE. AGAIN, MIKE AS WE GO TO THE BOTTOM PART OF THE SLIDE, BIKE LANE SWEEPING AND THE BIKE CYCLE TRACKS ARE REQUIRING US TO SPEND MORE ON THE MAINTENANCE THAN WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY. GOING INTO THE WATER FUND, THE ITEMS TO POINT OUT ON THIS SLIDE ARE, AGAIN, OUR ELECTRIC VEHICLES, GREEN FLEETS, COST AS WE GO FORWARD WITH SUSTAINABILITY, AND IT HITS THIS FUND AS DOES IT HIT THE STORMWATER FUND. AS WE MANAGE OUR STORMWATER SYSTEM MORE FROM AN ASSET MANAGEMENT STANDPOINT, THERE -- WE NEED INCREASED ENGINEERING SUPPORT TO UNDERTAKE THOSE ACTIVITIES. MOVING ON TO THE NEXT SLIDE, THE SOLID WASTE FUND, TOP OF THIS SLIDE IS GREEN FLEETS INCREASE TO SUPPORT GREEN FLEETS. AND ALSO AS PART OF THAT, A RAPID VEHICLE CHARGER. AS WE LOOK TO GOING TO AN ELECTRIC SOLID WA WASTE GARBAGE TRUCK AND NEEDING A RAPID CHARGER ON THAT VEHICLE. THERE IS OFFSET BECAUSE WE HAVE LESS FUEL. WE HAVE TO HAVE A VEHICLE AND A BODY TO PICK THE COMPOST UP. SO THAT'S IN RESPONSE TO PICKING UP OUR COMPOST PICKUP. OTHER ITEMS WORTH MENTIONING ON THIS SLIDE IS AT THE BOTTOM, A NEW TRUCK. AS WE MIGRATE AWAY FROM THE 300 300-GALLON TOTES, WE WILL BE NEEDING TO CHANGE OUR TRUCK THAT PICKS UP 300-GALLON TOTES TO A TRUCK THAT WILL PICK UP DUMPSTERS AND BE MORE FLEXIBLE GOINGORRD. SYSTEMS PLANNING. STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE FOR SYSTEMS PLANNING WILL BE TO MOVE THE ALLEN CREEK WATERSHED SCORE FROM A 9 TO A10. IT'S A STRETCH GOAL BUT IT'S ONE WORTH WORKING TO ACHIEVE. THERE IS NO INCREMENTAL RESOURCES NEEDED IN SYSTEMS PLANNING. SYSTEMS PLANNING CORE SERVICES, THEY M MANAGE THE STORMWATER RETENTION AND INFILTRATION PROGRAM. SO WE WILL CONTINUE INSTALLING GREEN CHASSE TO INCREASE OUR -- INCREASE OUR STORMWATER. INCREASE THE PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT AND THIS IS ACROSS ALL AREAS, PUBLIC SERVICES COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT, PUBLIC ENSTAGEMENT AND THIS IS AN EFFORT TO INCREASE THE DIVERSITY ACROSS ALL OF OUR ENGAGEMENT. THE MODELING FOR OUR  SANITARY STORM AND WATER SYSTEM IS DONE IN SYSTEMS PLANNING. AND THAT IS CRITICAL SUPPORT AS WE MODEL AND LOOK AT WHAT WE NEED TO DO GOING FORWARD WITH EACH OF THOSE SYSTEMS AND MOVING ON TO THE NEXT SLIDE. THE FINANCIAL IMPACTS A MINNAL DECREASE FOR THE TREE LINE. FOR THE WATER FUND WE HAVE TO UPDATE OUR MODEL, IT'S DUE, AND WE'LL BE MIGRATING IT TO A NEW PLATFORM FROM THE STORMWATER SIDE, EVERY THREE YEARS WE DO AN IMPERVIOUS WATER UPDATE AND IT'S DUE NEXT YEAR AND WE WILL BE PERFORMING THAT. MOVING TO THE WATER PLANT, EACH OF THESE GOALS ARE THE PERFORMANCE MEASURES ARE WHAT WE ALREADY ACHIEVE AND DO. IT'S OUR STANDARD OF OPERATING. NEXT. FOR THE WATER PLANT, WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT, IMPACTS THE CHEMICAL FEED SYSTEM, AND FILTER PRESS IMPROVEMENTS NEED TO OCCUR. BARTON PUMP STATION, WHICH IS THE PUMP AT THE BOTTOM OF THE HILL AT THE RIVER THAT PUMPS THE RIVER WATER UP TO THE PLANT, THAT NEEDS TO DO SOME UPGRADES. AND WITHIN THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM, WE ALSO HAVE PUMP UPGRADES THAT NEED TO OCCUR. COULCORE SERVICES, FIRST BLOCK REPRESENTS WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT FOR WHAT WE -- HOW WE OPERATE OUR GOALS, WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY NON-DETECT AND DOCTOR THE PFAS, TURBIDITY, ET CETERA. THE WATER COMPLAINTS LESS THAN 38 A YEAR. THAT WOULD BE TASTE, ODOR AND COLOR TO WATER. THAT WOULD BE OUR GOAL THE DRINKING WATER AWARENESS WITH COVID, WE HAVEN'T BEEN DOING PLANT SOURS. WE HAVEN'T BEEN ACTIVELY ENGAGING THE PUBLIC IN COMING TO THE PLANT TO SEE HOW WATER IS PROCESSED. BUT WE WILL BRING THOSE BACK AS COVID PROGRAM. S DOWN. AND THE OTHER TWO ARE JUST GOOD OPERATING MEASURES THAT WANTING TO DO PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE IN THE RIGHT AMOUNT VERSUS REACTIVE MAINTENANCE. THE IMPACTS, THESE ARE GENERAL FUND IMPACTS ALTHOUGH WE ARE IN THE WATER TREATMENT PLANT THESE ARE THE EFFORTS THAT THE WATER TREATMENT PLANT DOES ON BEHALF OF THE GENERAL FUND FOR THE HYDRO DAMS FOR THE DAMS SYSTEMST GENERATE ELECTRICITY. THE BIG LARGE ITEMS ON THE BOTTOM ARE REQUIRED BECAUSE THEY ARE THEY ARE MANAGED BY FERC AND WE HAVE TO MAKE THOSE INVESTMENTS TO KEEP OUR OPERATING LICENSES. NEXT. EMPACTS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE PLANT. THE WATER INTERN POSITION IS A POSITION THAT WOULD BE A GRADUATE OR SENIOR COLLEGE STUDENT THAT WOULD BE WORKING ON ISSUES AT THE WATER PLANT. THE WATER QUALITY RESEARCH, IS A MATCH. WE HAVE AN ONGOING GRANT THAT THEY ARE LOOKING AT CATER QUALITY ON OUR FILTERS AND HOW WE CAN IMPROVE IT. THE BIGGEST ONE ON THIS CHART ARE THE CHEMICAL PRICE INCREASES AND ENGINEERING SERVICES FOR ASSET MANAGEMENT. AS WE GO FORWARD WITH OUR NUMBER OF REPLACEMENT PROJECTS THAT WE HAVE, WE EXCEED THE OUR OUR ENGINEERING EFFORTS THAT ARE EMBEDDED IN THE PLAN. WE SEE A MODEST INCREASE IN ELECTRICAL SERVICES NEEDED AND SCAD UPDATES. AND THAT IS ALL BEING OFFSET BY RATES. MOVING TO WASTEWATER TREATMENT, THE GOAL IS 99% COMPLIANCE WITH OUR OUR DAILY NPDES COMPLIANCE. THE IMPACT THAT WE ARE ASKING MONEY FOR IS REVISITING OUR BIODIGESTER FEASIBILITY STUDY AND NEEDING TO UPDATE THAT STUDY AND LOOK AT IT GIVEN THE CURRENT VIEW TOWARDS SUSTAINABILITY AND ISSUES THAT WE MAY BE FACING IN THE FUTURE. YOU WILL SEE THIS UNDER OUR FUTURE LONG-TERM IMPACTS OF LAND APPLICATION. CORE SERVICES. THE FIRST ONE IS GOES WITHOUT SAYING. IT'S RUNNING A PLANT NEAT AND CLEANLY. THIS SECOND ONE IS THE LAND APP OF BIOSOLIDS AND THAT WAS ONE OF THOSE THAT A DIGESTER, A DYEIO DIGESTER WOULD HELP US WITH LESS LAND APPS BEING NEEDED. AGAIN, THE OPEN HOUSES HAVE NOT BEEN OCCURRING, BUT WE NEED TO BRING THOSE BACK AS COVID IS LETTING GO OF ITS GRIP ON US. AND THE OTHER ONE IS WE'RE OBVIOUSLY AFTER 100% OF OUR STAFF HAVING UP-TO-DATE SAFETY TRAINING. GOING FORWARDS THE BIG ITEM IS SOLIDS HANDLING AND ANTICIPATED LANDFILL INCREASE, AS OUR LANDFILL CONTRACT COMES UP FOR RENEWAL, WE ARE EXPECTING THAT THAT PRICE WILL GO UP. WE ARE EXPECTING NATURAL GAS AND ELECTRICITY INCREASES TO HIT THE PLANT HEAVILY THE WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT IS THE LARGEST ENTITY USER IN THE CITY. OR RISON ISSUE -- HORIZON ISSUES FACING US. INCREASING REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, PFAS. WE'LL SEE A NATIONAL STANDARD OR LIMIT FOR PFAS COME DOWN. WE ARE VERY WELL POSITIONED FOR THAT GIVEN THE LEADERSHIP OF OUR STAFF AT THE WATER TREATMENT PLANT. WHERE THAT WILL CAUSE US PROBLEMS IS NOT ON THE WATER SIDE BUT ON THE WASTEWATER SIDE, PFAS WILL PASS THROUGH THE PLANT AND AS THE REGULATIONS TIGHTEN UP, WE MAY HAVE PFAS ISSUES WITH OUR WASTE. NPDES PHOSPHORUS LIMITS ON THE WASTEWATER IS AN ISSUE. CHLORIDES, LEAD AND COPPER ARE ISSUES WE WILL BE FACING ON THE DRINKING WATER SIDE. SUCCESSION PLANNING AND RETIREMENTS AND RECRUITMENT ARE ALWAYS A DRUGLE FOR OUR OPERATION AS WE COMPLETE AGAINST THE PRIVATE SECTOR AS THE ECONOMY HEATS UP AND THERE IS -- BETTER TIMES COMING, IT'S HARDER FOR US TO RECRUIT STAFF. CHANGES IN THE SOLID WASTE PROGRAM WILL BE ISSUES AS WE GO FORWARD: CONTRACTOR ESCALATING COSTS IS A MAJOR ISSUE WE WILL BE FACING IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS. AS AN EXAMPLE, ON ONE OF OUR STORMWATER PROJECTS THAT WE ARE STARTING TO LOOK AT, THE CHURCHILL POND, THE COST OF DIRT MOVING ON THAT PROJECT HAS DOUBLED FROM PRECOVID TO CURRENT PRICES. AND THAT IS A SCARY TREND FOR US IN OTHER PROJECTS. HOPEFULLYWE WON'T SEE IT IN OTHER PROJECTS BUT IT'S ONE THAT WE WILL HAVE TO BE FACING. THE OTHER -- YOU KNOW, THE AGING INFRASTRUCTURE, WE HAVE TO KEEP VIGILANT ON REPLACING OUR INFRASTRUCTURE. LAND APPLICATION, BIODIGESTER, IF WE CAN GO TO BIODIGESTING, IT WILL HELP THE PRESSURE WE HAVE ON LAND APP. GOING FORWARD LAND APPLICATION WILL BECOME HARDER AS THERE'S LESS LAND AVAILABLE, FARMERS WILLING TO TAKE THE LAND APP. THE INCREASING NON-MOTORIZED ASSETS, BIKE PATHS, CYCLE TRACKS, AS YOU SAW AS WE WENT THROUGHOUT PRESENTATION, WE ARE HAVING TO RAMP UP THE MONEY PUT FORWARD TO THOSE PROJECTS FOR ONGOING MAINTENANCE AS WE BUILD THEM. AND I'M OPEN TO QUESTIONS.
00:47:44.819: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER DISCH?
00:47:47.889: >> Councilmember Disch: THAN YOU. SO I TNK TWO QUEIONS. THK YOU FOR VY DAILE AND SRITED PRESENTATION, MR. HUPY. SO I SEE THAT YOU HAVE A SOLID WASTE GOAL OF INCREASING COMMERCIAL RECYCLING BY 5%, WHICH I THINK IS EXCITING, BUT I'M WONDERING HOW EXACTLY YOU ARE -- WHAT'S THE PLAN FOR ACHIEVING THAT, BECAUSE I DON'T -- I'M LOOKING AT ALL THE SLIDES ABOUT WHERE YOU ARE INCREASING THINGS AND I SEE RESIDENTIAL RECYCLING CART AND MULTIFAMILY RECYCLE DUMPSTERS BUT I DON'T SEE ANYTHING -- I DON'T SEE ANYTHING ADDITIONAL BEING EXTENDED TO COMMERCIAL. SO IS THERE MORE EDUCATION THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN? WHAT'S GOING TO INCREASE THESE RATES?
00:48:37.372: >> AS ON ONE OF THE SLIDES AS WE WENT THROUGH, WE TALKED ABOUT SUPPORT FOR OUTSIDE CONSULTING ON THAT. THAT'S WHERE WE WILL BE DEVELOPING THOUGH PLANS AND GOING OUT TO BID FOR THOSE SERVICES. AS WE RATIONALIZE HOW WE DO COLLECTION IN THE DOWNTOWN, THE GOAL IS TO MAKE IT EASIER AND MORE CONVENIENT FOR THES TO USE THOSE SERVICES -- THE FOLKS TO USE THOSE SERVICES.
00:49:16.177: >> Councilmember Disch: OKAY. AND THEN SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT QUESTION. YOU HAVE GOT -- WHERE YOU LIST OVER A MILLION FOR COMMERCIAL COMPOST AND A 1.5 MILLION FOR MULTIFAMILY, THAT'S INCREASED EXPENSES THERE?
00:49:36.531: >> THOSE ARE THE INCREASED EXPENSES TO UNDERTAKE THOSE SERVICES.
00:49:45.173: >> THOSE ARE SERVICES WE ARE ESSENTIALLY NOT PROVIDING AT ALL RIGHT NOW. HOW DOES COMMERCIAL COMPOSTING AND YEAR-ROUND RESIDENTIAL COMPOSTING ALIGN WITH A2ZERO GOALS OF CARBON NEUTRALITY? ARE WE DRIVING MORE TRUCKS AROUND AND PICKING STUFF UP BUT NOT GETTING A BIG BANG FOR THAT BUCK?
00:50:07.295: >> I THINK Y YOU ARE AIMING AT RESIDENTIAL YEAR-ROUND PICKUP AND THAT MAY BE THE CASE AS WE LOOK AT IT IN DETAIL. FOR THE COMMERCIAL AND MULTIFAMILY THE EXPECTATION IS THAT DIVERTING THAT OUT OF THE PASTE STREAM WILL MORE THAN OFFSET.
00:50:32.053: >> OKAY. THANK YOU.
00:50:35.656: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
00:50:36.591: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WANTED TO POINT OUT, ESPECIALLY FOR THE NEW COUNCILMEMBERS THAT ON SLIDE 19, WE HAVE A $200,000 DECREASE IN PEDESTRIAN SAFETY AND THE SCHOOL ZONES AND THAT'S THE RESULT OF A VERY AGGRESSIVE, PROBABLY FIVE-YEAR PROGRAM FOLLOWING THE DEATH OF A STUDENT. WE BEING THE COMMUNITY AND STAFF IDENTIFIED AND PRIOR IDALIAIZED ALL THE SCHOOL WALK ZONE -- PRIORITIZED ALL THE SCHOOL WALK ZONES AND THAT PROJECT IS JUST ABOUT COMPLETED. I WANTED TO SAY THANK YOU TO STAFF. THAT WAS A MAJOR IMPROVEMENT. IF YOU LOOK AT HURON PARKWAY NEAR HURON HIGH SCHOOL, YOU WILL SEE THE FLASHERS AND ALL THE SIGNS. THAT'S A MODEL FOR PEDESTRIAN SAFETY? -- SAFETY IN SCHOOL WALK ZONES.
00:51:30.611: >> AND IF I CAN JUST INTERRUPT A SECOND. ALTHOUGH THEY ARE INSTALLED, WE CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THEM AND TWEAK THE INSTALLATIONS. THE YELLOW FLASHING BALLS, YOU HAVE SEEN US ADD THOSE ON SO THAT WE CAN CONTROL NOTIFYING THE MOTORISTS WHEN THE SCHOOL SWEDE LIMITS ARE IN EFFECT. ALTHOUGH WE ARE INSTALLING NEW ONES, WE HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN THE OLD ONES.
00:52:01.309: >> Councilmember Griswold: AND REMEMBERING WHEN SCHOOL IS IN SESSION AND ALL OF THOSE DITAILS YES. AND THEN VISION ZERO, YOU USED THE TERM "MARKET."
00:52:15.223: >> EDUCATION, MARKETING.
00:52:16.958: >> I THINK EDUCATION SOUNDS MORE SINCERE THAN JUST SELLING A PRODUCT.
00:52:24.198: >> POINT TAKEN.
00:52:24.599: >> Councilmember Griswold: THANKS.
00:52:26.701: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
00:52:27.568: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. AND THANKS TO STAFF FOR PROVIDING US SEASON'S INFORMATION. I HAVE A QUESTION ON THE RATE INCREASES PROPOSED ON PAGE SEVEN. WE WERE TOLD IN PRIOR YEARS THAT I BELIEVE THESE PERCENTAGES WHEN THEY CAME TO STORM AND WATER WILL BE HIGHER THAN WHAT WE ARE SEEING HERE TODAY, STORM 5%, I THOUGHT, PERHAPS LAST YEAR WE WERE LOOKING AT SOMETHING CLOSER TO 13%. SEWER, I DIDN'T THINK WE WOULD HAVE A ZERO PERCENT. I'M JUST WONDERING WHAT'S HAPPENED ALONG THE WAY TO -- TO REVISE THOSE NEEDS. AND JUST CURIOUS AS TO WE ARE NOT EVEN RAISING THE SEWER AT ALL IF WE HAVE INFLATIONARY PRESSURES WITH NATURAL GAS AND ELECTRICITY, SHOULDN'T WE BE ABSORBING THOSE IN SOME RATE INCREASES RATHER THAN A FUND BALANCE? AND THEN I HAVE SOME OTHER QUESTIONS.
00:53:41.409: >> WELL, I WILL ASK MARTI TO ANSWER THOSE. BUT, AGAIN, REMEMBERING WHAT SHE SAID AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PRESENTATION, WE LOOK AT THE RATE MODELS EACH AND EVERY YEAR TO SEE WHAT OUR NEEDS ARE AND HOW THE RATES NEED TO BE CHANGED TO SUPPORT THE OPERATION. AS TO WHAT HAPPENED, I THINK OPEN WASTEWATER, WE WERE LOOKING AT ABOUT A 3% AND WE HAVE TAKEN IT DOWN TO ZERO, BUT I WILL LET MARTI TO SPEAK TO EACH OF THOSE.
00:54:13.974: >> HE WHY, THAT'S CORRECT. -- YES, THAT'S CORRECT. ON THE SEWER SIDE, WE WERE ANTICIPATING ABOUT A 3% INCREASE, HOWEVER, WE HAVE FOUND THAT IT'S REALLY ISN'T NECESSARY AND DUE TO THE HARDSHIPS THAT ARE RESIDENTS ARE EXPERIENCING, WE WERE ABLE TO DROP IT TO ZERO AND STAY WITHIN THE 3% FOR '25 AND '26 AND SUPPORT THE OPERATIONS AS WELL AS THE CAPITAL INVESTMENT ME NEEDED TO MAKE WITH THAT RATE INCREASE. ON THE STORM SIDE, ACTUALLY YOU ARE CORRECT, 3% WAS OUR LAST INCREASE LAST YEAR BUT PER THAT LEVEL OF SERVICE PLAN, FISCAL YEAR '22 SHOWED A 5% INCREASE AND THEN THERE AFTERIT WOULD BE ASH THE -- THEREAFTER, IT WOULD AROUND 5% AND THAT'S FITTING IN WITH THE PLAN.
00:55:07.161: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: WELL, I APPRECIATE THAT AND I'M SURE THE RESIDENTS WILL TOO WITH IT COMES TO PAYING THEIR BILLS . ON PAGE 24 WE TALK ABOUT THE INCREASED MAINTENANCE REGARDING THE BIKE LANE. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT UNFORTUNATELY MANY CONSTITUENTS AND RESIDENTS ARE UNAWARE OF, THE ONGOING MAINTENANCE GOVERNMENT WITH WE AT TO OUR INFRASTRUCTURE. WHAT WERE THESE COSTS JUST THREE YEARS AGO? DO WE KNOW? I MEAN RIGHT NOW WE ARE TALKING $300,000 PERHAPS. AND IS THIS JUST IN THE PROTECTED BIKE LANES? ARE WE TALKING ARTERIALS? HOW MUCH DOES $300,000 GET US AND WHERE WAS THAT A FEW YEARS AGO?
00:55:58.946: >> WE CAN GET BACK TO YOU WITH WHAT WE SPENT THREE YEARS AGO ON THAT. IT'S NOT ONLY IN THE NEW LANES WE HAVE BUILT BUT IT'S A HIGHER LEVEL OF SERVICE IN THE EXISTING LANES, LET'S SAY OUT PACKARD. WE ARE PUTTING MORE EFFORT IN MAIN TAPING THE EXISTING BIKE LANES, BESIDES THE ONES WE HAVE ADDED. I DON'T KNOW IF WE CAN TEASE OUT HOW MUCH IS INCREASED LEVEL OF SERVICE AND HOW MUCH IS NEW SERVICE.
00:56:32.613: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  SO THAT $277,000 OR THEREABOUTS DOES THAT INCLUDE THE MONTHLY SWEEPING THAT OCCURS OR IS THERE ADDITIONAL FUNDS FROM ACT 51 OR SOMEWHERE ELSE THAT PAY FOR THAT? WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET IS $277,000, I'M SORRY. GO AHEAD.
00:56:55.870: >> I BELIEVE THAT'S CORRECT AND I'M LOOKING AT MARTI AS I SAY THAT.
00:57:00.808: >> YES, SO THE.
00:57:02.743: >> IT'S AN INCREASED LEVEL OF SERVICE. WE WERE SWEEPING THE ACTUAL BIKE LANES AT  HIGHER FREQUENCY THAN THE ROAD ITSELF. AND THE $277,000 WAS INCREASED SWEEPING FREQUENTLY. I THINK THE PUBLIC WORKS STAFF WAS DOING THAT TWICE A MONTH, IF I RECALL THAT CORRECTLY.
00:57:21.328: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: AND, AGAIN, WHAT PARTS OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE? CAN YOU GET THAT NOW OR LATER.
00:57:43.918: >> WE WILL LOOK AT WHETHER WE CAN DECIPHER THAT OUT.
00:57:49.723: >> SOME OF THAT IS LEAVES FALLING. AND THIS YEAR WE SAW A BIG SPIKE IN THE AMOUNT OF LEAVES IN THE BIKE LANE. WE CAN LOOK AT TEASING IT A PART.
00:58:02.836: >> ANYTHING WOULD BE BETTER THAN THE GENERAL SUM. WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF WE WILL BE INCREASING BIKE LANES, I THINK IN THIS PRESENTATION, YOU TALKED ABOUT TEN MORE MILES HERE SHORTLY, THE ONGOING CARRYING COST OF THIS NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WE ARE SIGNING UP TO HERE WITH SUBSCRIBING TO DO THIS. IT'S IMPORTANT. AND IF I COULD GET THAT, WHAT ARE WE TAKING FOR THE BIKE LANES? WE HAVE OTHER AREAS OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE THAT ARE EXCEEDINGLY DANGEROUS AND DON'T MAKE THE CUT IN TERMS OF REPLACEMENT OR ADDRESSING. IF WE GO BACK TO PAGE 10, APOLOGIZE. WE TALK ABOUT 18% OF THE FUND BALANCE GOs TO SUSTAINABILITY. WHAT PART OF SUSTAINABILITY IS THAT GOING TO? IS IT PART OF THE COMPOSTING. WE TALK ABOUT 18% GOING TO SUSTAINABILITY, WHAT --
00:59:07.234: >> WHAT SLIDE AGAIN, PLEASE?
00:59:08.869: >> PAGE 10.
00:59:10.371: >> YES, THAT INCLUDE SUCH AREAS AS STAINABILITY, BUT THAT'S NOT SUSTAINABILITY IN TOTAL. THAT INCLUDES ADMINISTRATION COSTS, LANDFILL MAINTENANCE COSTS, CUSTOMER SERVICE, AND SUSTAINABILITY IS ONE PROSECUTION OF THAT 18%.
00:59:37.297: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  AND WHAT DOES THAT INCLUDE?
00:59:39.600: >> IT'S MOSTLY STAFF EFFORT. IT'S STAFF -- SUSTAINABILITY STAFF IS FUNDED WITH THE SOLID WASTE MILLAGE.
00:59:47.541: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU SO MUCH.
00:59:48.709: >> YOU BET.
00:59:50.144: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER
00:59:56.150: >> Councilmember Briggs: FOLLOWI NG UP ON THE BIKE LANE MAINTENANCE. AND IMPROVING THE LEVEL OF SERVICE IS GREAT TO SEE, ESPECIALLY IF OUR INVENTORIES IS WE NEED TO MAKE SUR THAT OURLED. INFRASTRTURE IS WL MATAED. EAT  SEEHA THE ADDITIONA FTE FORND STREETLIGHTS. COULD YOU DESCRIBE A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT POSITION IS AND IF ADDING THAT POSITION MEANS THAT THAT FREES UP OTHER STAFF MEMBERS TO BE FOCUSING IN ON, OR WERE THEY FOCUSED ON STREETLIGHTS.
01:00:42.863: >> THAT POSITION IS -- LET ME BACK UP AND SAY DURING GREAT RECESSION, WE HAD IGNORED OUR STREETLIGHTS WE JUST CUT OUR MAINTENANCE AND BUDGET TO THEM TO THE BONE. WE WERE ONLY BUYING THE ELECTRICITY. AS WE GO FORWARD WE ARE RAMP UP TO MANAGE THEM AS AN ASSET CATEGORY, AS AN ASSET SYSTEM, AND THAT REQUIRES STAFF TO TEND TO THAT. JUST AS WE DO MODELING AND ASSET INVENTORY IN THE OTHER SYSTEMS. FOR EXAMPLE, WHY WE DO MODELING AND WATER, STORM AND SANITARY AND WE DO G.I.S. MAINTENANCE IN THOSE, WE PROBABLY HAVE OH, FIVE PEOPLE THAT ARE ENGAGED IN JUST THE SUPPORT OF THOSE SYSTEMS AND THEIR ASSET MAGMENT WE NEED TO BUILD THAT ABILITY TO BUILD THE STREETLIGHT SYSTEM. IT WILL NOT BE 100% ONLY STREETLIGHT. THEY WILL BE USED IN OTHER AREAS IN SIGNS AND SIGNALS BUT IT'S PROO I MARELY SUPPORTING STREETLIGHTS AND ASSET MANAGEMENT AND MAKING SURE WE ARE IDENTIFYING WHAT LIGHTS NEED MAINTENANCE AND WHEN IT'S BEING DONE AND WHEN THEY ARE BEING REPLACED, ET CETERA.
01:02:13.253: >> Councilmember Briggs: OKAY. THANKS. I KNOW THAT -- I KNOW THAT DTE WAS UPGRADING THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE AND CHANGING OUT TO MORE L.E.D. LIGHTS. IS THAT SOMETHING THAT'S HAPPENING INTERNALLY WITHIN OUR SYSTEM AS WELL?
01:02:33.907: >> I SHOULD HAVE THIS PERCENTAGE OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD BECAUSE WE JUST DISCUSSED THIS WITH MR. CRAWFORD A LITTLE BIT AGO. A LOT OF OUR STREETLIGHTS ARE ALREADY CHANGED OVER TO L.E.D. AND I DON'T KNOW IF MARTI PRASCHAN KNOWS ARE L.E.D.
01:02:53.794: >> Councilmember Briggs: I WAS JUST CURIOUS.
01:02:55.662: >> NO, IT IS THE DIRECTION WE ARE GOING.
01:02:57.965: >> Councilmember Briggs: I GUESS THE FOLLOWIUM ON THIS IS I KNOW WE ARE UPDATING -- AT SOME POINT WE WILL HAVE OUR LIGHT ORDINANCE THAT IS FOR PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT FOCUSED ON ADDRESSING SORT OF LIGHT POLLUTION AND I KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN SOME KIND OF INTERNAL DISCUSSIONS AROUND THE ORANGE BOOK AND HOW THAT MIGHT KIND OF COORDINATE AROUND OUR STREETLIGHT AND HOW THAT WORKS INTO THIS NEW POSITION.
01:03:39.640: >> YES, ALL THE FIXTURES WE ARE PURCHASING ARE FOR STREETLIGHTS ARE DARK SKY FRIENDLY. I DON'T WANT TO SAY THEY ARE ALL CERTIFIED, BUT THEY ARE -- WE VERY MUCH LOOK AT DARK SKIES AS WE ARE PURCHASING THEM.
01:04:02.396: >> Councilmember Briggs: THANK YOU SO MUCH.
01:04:04.031: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER SONG.
01:04:06.533: >> Councilmember Song: THE CONTRACTOR COSTS, IS THAT SOMETHING WE SAW RECOVERING FROM THE LAST RECESSION. IS THERE ANY WAY TO, I DON'T KNOW, COORDINATION WITH OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS OR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS THAT ARE HAPPENING IN TOWN? I UNDERSTAND WE HAVE DIFFERENT PROCESSES FOR RFPs AND EVERYTHING, BUT IF THERE'S -- I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S BEING DONE AT U OF M, COULD WE LEVERAGE THEIR WORK WHILE THEY ARE WORKING. I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S A WAY THAT WE CAN -- IF WE ARE EXPECTING THIS CAPACITY, ARE THERE CREATIVE WAYS TO MITIGATE THAT, AND HAVE WE DONE THAT BEFORE?
01:04:54.915: >> YES, YES, AN EXAMPLE IS THE CHURCHILL POND THAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO THIS YEAR -- PLANNING TO DO THIS YEAR. WE ARE DOING THAT AT THE SAME TIME AS SCIO CHURCH IS BEING RECONSTRUCTED AND WE WOULD BE MINIMIZING THE IMPACT TO THE RESIDENTS AND ALSO MAKING IT -- THE SITE COULD HAVE THE -- THE CONTRACTOR COULD HAVE THE SITE WITH LESS TRAFFIC WHILE WE ARE DOING. WE COORDINATE FREQUENCY PROJECTS WITH THE U. SOUTHWEST UNIVERSITY, WHICH WAS COMPLETED LAST YEAR, THAT ACTUALLY WAS A COMBINED PROJECT WITH THE CITY AND THE UNIVERSITY AND IN THAT CASE, WE HAD THE U TAKING THE LEAD ON THE CONSTRUCTION. UPCOMING IN THE NEAR FUTURE, THE ANN STREET OBSERVATORY WATER MAIN PROJECT WILL BE DONE IN CONJUNCTION WITH WHAT THE U CALLS THE C. I.T., THE TOWER THAT WE ARE WORKING ON. THAT WILL BE A PROJECT WHERE THEY WILL TAKE THE LEAD ON THE WATER AND WE WILL TAKE THE LEAD ON ROAD RECONSTRUCTION AFTERWARDS. SO YES, WE VERY FREQUENTLY LOOK AT WHAT THE PARTNERS ARE OUT THERE AND CAN WE ACHIEVE ECONOMY?
01:06:27.441: >> Councilmember Song: THANK YOU.
01:06:31.711: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER QUESTIONS? THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
01:06:40.687: >> HOPEFULLY I LEFT ENOUGH TIME FOR MR. POSTEMA.
01:06:43.290: >> City Atty. Postema: I DON'T NEED THAT MUCH TIME, BUT LOOKING AT YOUR PRESENTATION AND WHEN I TALKED ABOUT MR. WILHELM'S RESPONSIBILITY TO UNDERSTAND THAT AND DO ALL THE WORK ASSOCIATED WITH THAT. IT FREAKS ME OUT. I WILL HAVE TO STABILIZE MYSELF AND GET GOING. I WILL DO THAT BY DOING A SCREEN SHARE. I DON'T KNOW WHY I APPEAR AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN SHARE.
01:07:21.161: >> Mayor Taylor: THAT'S OUTSTANDING!
01:07:25.866: >> City Atty. Postema: I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT. IT MUST HAVE DONE IT BY ITSELF.
01:07:30.437: >> Mayor Taylor: YOU ARE A ZOOM SAVANT!
01:07:33.507: >> City Atty. Postema: YEAH, YEAH. IT IS HELPFUL TO SORT OF BAT CLEANUP IN ONE AGAINST GET A FULL UNDERSTANDING OF -- OF ONE SERVICE AREA SO YOU CAN LOOK THROUGH THAT -- YOU CAN LOOK -- THINK ABOUT THAT WHEN I COME TO SOME BOXES OF THE PEOPLE WHO DO THE WORK FOR THE SERVICE AREAS. OUR SERVICE SERVES THE CITY, SERVES THE COUNCIL AND SERVES THE SERVICE OTHER ADMINISTRATORS IN SERVING THE WORK. THE CHARTER HAS SPECIFIC MANDATES TO PROVIDE LEGAL ADVICE, TO DEAL WITH ANYTHING THAT IS IN COURT, TO PROSECUTE AND THEN TO REVIEW THE LEGALITY OF ALL OF THE CONTRACTS AND OTHER LEGAL INSTRUMENTS. THAT'S THE GENERAL GIST OF WHAT WE'RE MANDATED TO DO. AS FAR AS THE BOXES. LAST YEAR, I WENT THROUGH THESE AND YOU ALL KNOW THAT I BASICALLY HAVE DIVVIED UP THE ASSIGNMENTS IN THE OFFICE ON A BUSINESS MODEL THAT HAS AN ATTORNEY SPECIFICALLY ASSIGNED TO A SERVICE AREA. SO FOR PUBLIC SERVICES, THAT -- WHERE CRAIG JUST OUTLINED ALL THE WORK IN THAT AREA, THE PRIMARY ATTORNEY AS YOU KNOW IS MR. WILHELM, AND SO ONE OF HIS RESPONSIBILITIES, OBVIOUSLY IS TO UNDERSTAND ALL OF THE WORKINGS OF THAT BUSINESS UNIT, AND TO DO ALL OF THE LEGAL WORK THAT IS INVOLVED IN THE PUBLIC SERVICES. THE COMMUNITY SERVICES, OF COURSE, RECEIVE INN Mc -- KEVIN McDONALD IS ASSIGNED TO THAT AND FINANCIAL SERVICES BETSY BLAKE. SAFETY SERVICES IS SORT OF A HYBRID ARYAN SLAY DOES THE PROSECUTION AND ADVISES THE POLICE. JOHN RISER, WHO I HIRED IS A HYBRID BETWEEN COMMUNITY SERVICES AND PRIVATE SERVICES AND HE PROSECUTES ORDINANCE VIOLATIONS AND SO ON. YOU ALL KNOW ATTORNEY RADABAUGH AND SHE DOES THE EMPLOYMENT AND LABOR WORK FOR THE CITY AND THEN ATTORNEY CHRIS FROST ON THE BOARDS OF COMMISSIONS AND ON THE REAL ESTATE. WE DO PROBABLY OVER 100 REAL ESTATE MATTERS A YEAR, AND SO THAT MAY TO GO TO PUBLIC WORKS AND THERE MAY BE EASEMENTS AND LICENSES. AND ATTORNEY TOM MA WHO DOES FOIA -- THOMAS WHO DOES FOIA AND ELECTION ISSUES AND WORKS WITH ME ON LITIGATION MATTERS. LAST YEAR AT THIS TIME, WE WALKED ABOUT THE -- WE TALKED ABOUT THE DIFFICULTIES GOING BACK TO PUBLIC SERVICES THAT WE HAD LOOKED AT THAT MODEL AND THAT CRAIG HUPY HAD REALLY ASKED US TO GET ANOTHER ATTORNEY IN AND THAT'S WHY IT IT SAYS ATTORNEYS HERE. THAT'S ATTORNEY RICHARDS AND YOU AUTHORIZED THAT AND CRAIG FUNDED THAT. AND SO THAT'S THE COMPOSITION OF THE ATTORNEY'S OFFICE AND THAT IS THE WORK THAT WE DO. AND, AGAIN, HIGHLIGHTING WHEN WE WENT TO THE ISSUE OF WHAT IS GOING ON H HORIZON ISSUES IT REALLY DOES MIRROR THE HORIZON ISSUES THAT WERE PUT FORTH BY EACH OF THE DEPARTMENTS. AND I DON'T WANT TO READ THROUGH THIS. BEFORE WE GET TO PUBLIC SERVICES WE HAVE THREE GENERAL HORIZON ISSUES THAT ARE ALWAYS HORIZON ISSUES, BUT IN THIS CASE, WE'LL TAKE OUT A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT TONE. THERE IS SUCCESSION PLANNING THIS OUTLINE TONIGHT ON THE BUDGET WILL BE MY LAST TWO-YEAR BUDGET THAT I DO FOR THE CITY. AND THAT IS SOMEWHAT SOBERING FOR ME, BUT ALSO IT'S THE SAME THING I HAVE BEEN SAYING EVERY YEAR SINCE 2003. SO IT HAS A FAMILIAR RING IN SOME WAYS. BUT THAT'S GOING TO BE AN EFFORT THAT OBVIOUSLY I'M WORKING WITH THE COUNCIL ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE ON AND THERE WILL BE WORK THAT WE'LL NEED TO ATTEND TO THAT. SECOND ALTHOUGH IT'S THE THIRD BULLET POINT, WE ALWAYS HAVE SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION AND I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT, BECAUSE THAT INVOLVED BOTH TIME AND MONEY. SOMETIMES IT'S OUTSIDE COUNSEL. WE HAVE A RATE AND FEE FACE, THE HAHN CASE. OBVIOUSLY COUNCIL IS CONCERNED ABOUT A CASE LIKE THAT, A CASE THAT IS ALLEGING THINGS THAT ARE INCORRECT, FROM THE CITY'S POINT OF VIEW, BUT NONETHELESS CAUSE CONCERN NOT ONLY TO THE COUNCIL BUT TO THE RESIDENCE AND CERTAINLY PEOPLE RAISE AN ISSUE, WELL, YOU HAVE A LAW FIRM GOING AROUND AND SUING ALL THE MUNICIPALITIES THAT THEY HAVE ALL DONE ONE THING WRONG OR ANOTHER. WE TAKE THOSE ALLEGATIONS SERIOUSLY, BUT IN THAT TYPE OF LITIGATION, THE CITIES DO TAKE THAT SERIOUSLY. THE ONE CASE THAT WAS TALKED ABOUT LAST YEAR WAS A TRIAL VERDICT AGAINST BLOOMFIELD TOWNSHIP FOR $10 MILLION AND THAT'S WHAT CAN HAPPEN IN THESE TYPE OF CASES. INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH, AS THESE THINGS GO, EVEN A SMALLER COMMUNITY WILL DEFEND ITS RIGHT TO THEIR RATE AND FEE STRUCTURE AND THAT JURY VERDICT -- OR THAT VERDICT WAS OVERTURNED BY THE COURT OF APPEALS IN JANUARY. AND SO THIS TYPE OF LITIGATION DOES CAUSE MUNICIPALITIES TO DEFEND THEIR RIGHTS NOT JUST AT THE TRIAL LEVEL BUT ALSO APPELLATE LEVEL AND IN THAT CASE, THAT HAPPENED IN JANUARY AND JUST LAST WEEK THE COURT OF APPEALS ALSO MADE THAT A PUBLISHED OPINION RATHER THAN AN UNPUBLISHED OPINION, WHICH AS YOU ALL KNOW IS PRECEDENT FOR THE WHOLE STATE. I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO THAT LITIGATION HERE, BUT I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THIS IS BOTH TIME INTENSIVE AND MONEY INTENSIVE AND MUNICIPALITIES DO, IN FACT, DEFEND THEIR ABILITY TO -- TO DEFEND THEIR RATE STRUCTURES AND SO WE WATCH ANOTHER MUNICIPALITY, OBVIOUSLY, A SMALLER MUNICIPALITY DEFEND ITS RIGHT AND BE YOU SUCCESSFUL IN . AND SO WE WILL BE WATCHING THAT ISSUE. IT'S SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION BECAUSE IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT POINT AND WE HAVE DISCUSSED THAT BEFORE. SO THAT TYPE OF LITIGATION, OTHER LITIGATION IN THE PAST, DRAIN DISCONNECT CASES, THESE THINGS COME UP. NOW THE THIRD BULL LEFT POINT IN JEN -- BULLET POINT IS THE INCREASED WORK BY BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS. YOU ALL KNOW THAT THE CULTURE OF ANN ARBOR BE IS WE HAVE A LOT OF BOARDS. I NEVER COMPARED IT SPECIFICALLY TO OTHER CITIES BUT A LOT OF OTHER CITIES THINK WE HAVE LOTS OF BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS. LET'S PUT IT THAT WAY. I'M NOT CRITICIZING IT, AT ALL, AGAIN, IT'S IMPORTANT TO THE CULTURE, BUT IT DOES GENERATE ADDITIONAL WORK AND LEGAL ISSUES COMING OUT OF THOSE BOARDS AN COMMISSIONS. THOSE ARE GENERAL HORIZON ISSUES. YOU HEARD CRAIG G GO THROUGH ALL THE THINGS THEY ARE DOING. IT'S NOT JUST? PUBLIC WORKS BUT DR. STULTS SUSTAINABILITY EFFORTS, THOSE THINGS, THOSE GOALS AND EFFORTS DEAL WITH REGULATORY WORK, DEAL WITH ALL SORTS OF LEGAL ISSUES THAT COME OUT OF IT AND SO THAT'S JUST IMPORTANT TO -- AS FAR AS THEMES, SUSTAINABILITY AND FRANKLY TECHNOLOGY. ALL OF THE TECHNOLOGY CONTRACTS, ALL OF THOSE HAVE RISK ASPECTS AND SO THOSE ARE FAIRLY SPECIALIZED. SO THAT'S JUST ONE UNIT AND THAT'S PUBLIC SERVICES. I WILL GO -- FINANCIAL SERVICES, THE MAIN ASPECT OF THAT, ATTORNEY BLANK IS WORKING ON THIS IS THE CONTRACT LIFE CYCLE MANAGEMENT. IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS CITY-WIDE AND SHE HAS WORKED WITH I.T. AND REALLY PROCUREMENT ON THIS PROJECT AND THAT IS CONTINUING THIS YEAR. COMMUNITY SERVICES. I JUST FINISHED TALKING WITH DEREK DELACOURT SERVICES TODAY AND HE WAS LIKE CRAIG WAS LAST YEAR, AND THAT IS HE INDICATED HE WANTS MUCH MORE OF ATTORNEY McDONALD'S TIME. NOW GIVE THAN HE HAS ALL OF ATTORNEY McDONALD'S TIME, THE REQUEST IS FOR MORE TIME AND MORE -- IT MAY BE OUTSIDE COUNSEL ON SOME ASPECTS. AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING MILLAGE, AND GREEN BELT AND THOSE ACQUISITIONS ALTHOUGH NOT DONE BY ATTORNEY McDONALD, DONE BY ATTORNEY FROST, WE SEE -- I JUST GOT THE LIST OF EVEN CLOSINGS BY THE END OF THIS YEAR, AND CERTAINLY THEY ARE SUBSTANTIAL. HUMAN RESOURCES. ATTORNEY RADABAUGH WORKS ON ALL OF THESE THINGS. IT WAS ANNUA AN UNUSUAL YEAR THT GENERATED A LOT OF WORK FROM HERE AND WORKING WITH JOHN FORNY ER. SAFETY SER SERVICES ATTORNEY SLY HAS IDENTIFIED IS EVERY CITY IS DEALING WITH 80 NEW STATE LAWS GOING INTO EFFECT IN THE COMING MONTHS. IT'S STAGGERED A LITTLE BIT, BUT THE INTEGRATION OF THOSE LAWS INTO EXISTING LAWS AND AN EFFORT THAT REALLY IS PART OF A THREE-YEAR EFFORT THAT SHE'S BEEN DOING TO LOOK AT AND REDRAFT CURRENT CODE TO INTEGRATE ALL OF THIS IS GOING TO TAKE SIGNIFICANT TIME. AGAIN, IMPLEMENTATION OF THE POLICING MODEL THAT, HAS A LEGAL IMPACT MAINLY IN FOURTH AMENDMENT TRAINING, OTHER COMMUNITY STANDARDS TRAINING AND WORKING ON POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. NOW, AS FAR AS THE CITY ATTORNEY IMPACTS. WE TRIED DO A 5% BUDGET CUT. OBVIOUSLY $73,000 IS NOT 5% OF MY BUDGET. IT'S NOT THAT I'M NOT COMPLYING WITH THE DIRECTIVE. THIS IS INCOMPLETE. THE MAIN ABILITY FOR ME TO -- WE HAD IN THE BUDGET MONEY FOR OUTSIDE COUNSEL. THIS REPRESENTS TAKING AWAY ALMOST ALL THE OUTSIDE COUNSEL WORK AND THAT -- ANOTHER $50,000 IS NEEDED TO GET TO THE 5%. THIS IS INCONSISTENT WITH THE LEGAL NEEDS AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR WILL NEED TO LOOK AT. AND THE CITY ATTORNEY'S BUDGET IS JUST PERSONNEL. AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THE HORIZON ISSUES. WITH THAT, I DON'T WANT TO TAKE ANY MORE OF WHY YOU ARE TIME. MY PRESENTATION HAS BEEN SIMILAR EVERY YEAR. BUT IT GIVES YOU AN IDEA FOR THE NEW COUNCILMEMBERS WHO ARE IN THE BOXES. YOU HAVE MET A LOT OF THEM, AND I REMIND PEOPLE AGAIN THAT THEY ARE NOT JUST THINGS TO DO, BUT THERE'S PEOPLE WHO DO THEM, AND THEY WORK CLOSELY WITH THE SERVICE AREAS AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE A PROACTIVE VIEW OF LEGAL WORK IN THE CITY. SO WITH THAT, I WILL END IT AND TAKE ANY QUESTIONS.
01:21:25.037: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:21:25.905: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, MAYOR AND THANK YOU, MR. POSTEMA FOR THAT PRESENTATION. YOU MENTIONED HAVING AN OVER HIRE PROGRAM TO HELP WITH THE SUCCESSION PLANNING, AND MONEY WAS PUT ASIDE FOR THAT. I DIDN'T SEE THAT HERE. ARE YOU PLANNING TO DO THAT.
01:21:47.426: >> City Atty. Postema: USUALLY THE OVERHIGH PROGRAM IS DONE THROUGH THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR AND NOT THE INDIVIDUAL DEPARTMENT. I THINK THEY WILL NEED -- THEY MAY NEED AN OVERHIRE PROGRAM, EVEN IN MY -- IN MY POSITION, IN SOME WAYS, BECAUSE AS I HAVE OUTLINED TO THE ADMIN COMMITTEE AND I APPRECIATE YOUR INTEREST IN SUCCESSION PLANNING, COUNCICOUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI ANDI THINK ALL THE PEOPLE ON ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE ARE COMMITTED TO THAT. IF YOU LOOK AT HIRING FOR MY POSITION. OBVIOUSLY I WAS HIRED IN 2003, OVER 18 YEARS AGO. SO THE ISSUE WILL COME UP IF YOU HIRE SOMEONE FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR, AS I DID, THEY WOULD NEED TO COME IN AND ASSESS THINGS. SO THERE MAY BE A NEED TO DO SOME OVERHIRING. IF YOU HIRE AN INTERNAL CANDIDATE, IF SOMEBODY STEPS UP AND DOES THAT, YOU WILL NEED TO REPLACE THAT CANDIDATE'S WORK AT LEAST A PORTION OF THAT WORK. AND SO IT'S NOT THE FACE THAT SOMEONE INTERNAL CAN TAKE OVER BECAUSE YOU WILL HAVE TO DO ANOTHER HIRE ANYWAYS FOR AT LEAST A PORTION OF THE WORK. AND SO THAT REALLY IS THE -- IS THE ISSUE. THERE MAY WELL BE AN OVERHIRE COMPONENT OF THIS. IT JUST CAN'T FULLY BE DETERMINED RIGHT NOW AND SO THAT WOULD BE A DISCUSSION WITH THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR.
01:23:21.087: >> City Admin. Crawford: COUNCIL MEMBER RAMLAWI, WHILE THAT WAS NOT AN IMPACT IN OURPROOFOUS CONVERSATIONS WHEN A BUDGET WAS ORIGINALLY KIND OF BROUGHT TOGETHER AS A CONCEPT, THAT'S BEEN INCREASINGLY -- I THINK WE MAY NEED TO CONSIDER AND I MAY BE BRINGING FORWARD TO YOU WITH A RECOMMENDATION.
01:23:39.672: >> City Atty. Postema: THE SUCCESSION PLAN, COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI AND CERTAINLY THE COUNCIL IS AWARE OF IT. THE SUCCESSION PLANNING THAT I HAVE DONE OVER A FIVE-YEAR PERIOD REALLY WITH THE INPUT. ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE AND THE CONSTANT ATTENTION OF THE ADMIN COMMITTEE TO MAKE SURE THIS IS BEING FOLLOWED THROUGH. IT'S BEEN A REALLY SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM AND SO I APPRECIATE YOUR INTEREST IN THAT. I MAY HAVE ONE HIRE NEXT YEAR DEPENDING ON A TRANSITION. SO I WOULD HAVE TO TALK TO THE ADMINISTRATOR FURTHER BUT I DON'T USUALLY PUT IT IN MY BUDGET. THANK YOU.
01:24:24.917: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
01:24:25.918: >> THANKS FOR THE PRESENTATION. I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT OUTSIDE LEGAL FEES. ARE THEY TOTALED SOMEWHERE? ARE THEY ASSIGNED TO DIFFERENT ATTORNEYS DEPENDING WHAT THEY ARE DOING?
01:24:43.169: >> City Atty. Postema: WE DON'T USE OUTSIDE COUNSEL THAT MUCH, ALTHOUGH WE HAVE TWO LARGER CASES RIGHT NOW, BOTH GELMAN AND THE HN CE WHE WE DO HAV LEGAL FEES. AND SO I DON'T HAVE THAT IN THE BUDGET USUALLY CRAIG WOULD HAVE THOSE TYPE OF THINGS IN HIS BUDGET IN SOME WAY AND SO WE'LL BE REVIEWING THAT FURTHER WITH HIM. THAT USUALLY GETS DONE CLOSER TO THE TIME THE ADMINISTRATOR ACTUALLY FINISHES THE BUDGET BECAUSE IT'S NOT ALWAYS CLEAR WHAT THE HORIZON ISSUES FOR THOSE PARTICULAR LITIGATION. AND SO WE DON'T USUALLY PUT THAT IN, IN DECEMBER. SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO -- NEEDS TO BE ADJUSTED.
01:25:36.822: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER QUESTIONS?
01:25:44.697: >> City Atty. Postema: AND TO FOLLOW UP COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD, WE DO HAVE SOME OUTSIDE COUN COUNSEL IN MY BUDG. THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR PUT THAT IN LAST YEAR TO COVER SOME THINGS. WE USED PART OF IT, BUT MISCELLANEOUS THINGS MAY OR DO COME UP AND SO THAT'S ON ISSUE. I DEALT WITH THE COUNCIL LAST YEAR ON IT AND HIRING THE ADDITIONAL PERSON, WE'RE HOPING TO CUT THAT BACK SOMEWHAT IN MY BUDGET. SO THAT WAS THE PLAN AND WE'RE WORKING ON THAT. YEAH.
01:26:23.435: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER QUESTIONS? MR. POSTEMA, THANK YOU.
01:26:27.373: >> City Atty. Postema: THANK YOU, COUNCIL.
01:26:31.410: >> Mayor Taylor: WE NOW COME TO PUBLIC COMMENT GENERAL TIME. PUBLIC COMMENT GENERAL TIME IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MEMBERS OF PUBLIC TO SPEAK TO COUNCIL.

01:27:45.584: >> CALLER ENDING IN 888.
01:27:53.992: >> HI. MY NAME IS JOE SPALDING AND I'M CALLING FROM HOLLAND, MICHIGAN. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT BLOCK BUSTING EMINENT DOMAIN AND EVIL DEVELOPERS FOR A SECOND. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHY HOUSING IS IMPORTANT TO ME BEYOND WANTING TO END SEGREGATION ONCE AND FOR ALL. I'M PERMANENTLY LIVING IN MICHIGAN BUT I WAS IN CALIFORNIA FOR THREE YEARS AN WITHIN MONTHS OFFING THERE, IT BECAME CLEAR HOW VOLATILE THE DISCOURSE ON HOUSING HAS MADE THE POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT. CONVENTIONAL WISDOM SAYS -- THE FOUNDATION IS A MULTISIDED, WELL-INTENDED STRUGGLE OVER AN ISSUE THAT HAS BEEN A BUCK PASSED DOWN TO THE LOCAL LEVEL FOR OVER A CENTURY. THE I.P.O.C. KNOW ABOUT BLOCK BUSTING. WE KNOW ABOUT GOVERNMENT SEIZING BLACK AND BROWN-OWNED PROPERTIES FOR PRIVATE INVESTMENT AND TO BUILD HIGHWAYS. WE KNOW THAT IN MANY CITIES AREAS CURRENTLY ZONED FOR MULTIFAMILY HOUSING ARE PURPOSEFULLY PUT NEAR AND IN OUR COMMUNITIES. THIS IS RIGHTFULLY ANGERED ACTIVISTS WITH LONG MEMORIES LEADING TO PROGRESSIVE DISTRUST OF DEVELOPERS. THE TRADE SHOULD NOT HAND OUT TAX ABATEMENTS TO THOSE WHO BUILD ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. THIS IS WHY LEGALIZING FOURPLEXES ACROSS AMERICAN CITIES IS AN EQUITY ISSUE. NO ONE IS SAYING DENSITY IS NOT NEEDED. WE ALL KNOW THAT SUSTAINABILITY AND ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF LETTING PEOPLE LIVE NEAR THEIR JOBS. A POSITION THAT MAINTAINS THE SEGREGATIONIST STATUS QUO WE HEAR MOST FREQUENTLY IS WE NEED HOUSING, BUT NOT IN THIS SPOT. THIS IS WHY THE BERKELEY RESOLUTION IS SO SIGNIFICANT. I'M ASKING COUNCIL TO REVIEW THE RESOLUTION BERKELEY PASSED AND CONSIDER PASSING ONE THAT IS SIMILAR SUITED TO THE NEEDS OF ANN ARBOR. IT AIMS TO LEGALIZE FOURPLEXES BY 2023. THEY PASSED 100% AFFORDABLE HOUSING OVERLAY WHICH I BELIEVE COUNCILMEMBERS HAYNER AND GRISWOLD SHOULD TAKE A LOOK AT. OF I'M SERIOUS ABOUT THAT. HOUSING COULD ABSOLUTELY SPLIT THE DEMOCRATIC IN HALF OVER THE NEXT SIX YEARS BUT ANN ARBOR CAN LAY THE GROUND WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR IT CTA AND COUNTRY COME OUT STRONGER OVER THIS ISSUE IN A VERY HISTORIC WAY. THAT'S ALL I WANTED TO SAY TONIGHT. THANK YOU, EVERYONE, FOR GIVING ME YOUR TIME.
01:30:05.324: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
01:30:16.068: >> ANNE BANISTER.
01:30:23.375: >> HELLO, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
01:30:25.677: >> Mayor Taylor: YES, WE CAN.
01:30:26.778: >> OKAY. GREAT. HI. ANN BANNISTER AND I JUST HAD A QUESTION FROM THE ATTORNEY OFFICE'S PRESENTATION, MAYBE IN THE FUTURE. I THINK I HAD MADE THIS SUGGESTION LAST YEAR, BUT ON SLIDE 3 OF THE ATTORNEY'S OFFICE PRESENTATION, WE HAD ALL THE BOXES OF ALL THE DIFFERENT AREAS THAT THE ATTORNEY'S OFFICE COVERS AND I WOULD SUGGEST IT WOULD BE USEFUL TO TALK ABOUT HOW MANY FTE THERE ARE. I THINK THERE MIGHT BE 12FTE AND WHAT THE BUDGET IS. I THINK IT'S AROUND $3 MILLION AND IT WOULD BE GREAT IF THOSE DIFFERENT BOXES COULD BE BROKEN DOWN INTO A BIG PIE CHART ABOUT JUST FOR ACCOUNTABILITY, YOU KNOW, HOW MANY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS ARE SPENT IN EACH OF THE VARIOUS AREAS THAT WERE TALKED ABOUT TONIGHT. MR. POSTEMA GAVE A HIGH LEVEL RUN THROUGH OF A LOT OF VERY EXPENSIVE LEGAL WORK, BUT IT -- I WOULD THINK IT WOULD BE USEFUL IF WE COULD TIE IT TO SPECIFIC ATTORNEYS, SPECIFIC DEPARTMENTS THAT RELATED TO THOSE BOXES ON SLIDE THREE. THANK YOU.
01:31:40.752: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. WOULD ANYONE LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT, PLEASE PRESS STAR LINE TO INDICATE THAT YOU WISH TO SPEAK. STAR NINE.
01:32:13.885: >> PHONE NUMBER ENDING IN 323.
01:32:23.061: >> HELLO. CAN YOU HEAR ME?
01:32:24.496: >> Mayor Taylor: YES, WE CAN.
01:32:26.465: >> GOOD EVENING COUNCILMEMBERS AND MAYOR TAYLOR, MY NAME IS DEVIN MAYER. I'M A STUDENT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AND AN ATHLETE ON CAMPUS AND I'M ENROLLED IN THE MICHIGAN SOCIAL WORK PROGRAM. I HAVE SPOKEN HERE BEFORE AND I WILL GO AHEAD AND INTRODEUCE MYSELF AGAIN JUST IN CASE ANYONE HAS NOT MET ME BEFORE. BUT BEFORE I START, I FEEL IT'S IMPORTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE PRIVILEGE AND STATUS PRIOR TO SPEAKING BEFORE A GROUP OF PEOPLE SUCH LIKE YOURSELVES I'M A WHITE MIDDLE-CLASS AFFLUENT MALE, AND I SEEK TO UTILIZE MY PRIVILEGE TO SPEAK FOR THOSE VISIONS WHO HAVE BEEN REJECTED OR SILENCED. I'M HERE TO SPEAK ON SURVIVORS SPEAK WHO SEEKS TO AMPLIFY THE VOICES OF THOSE WHO SEEK INJUSTICE. DESPITE ANN ARBOR IN ELITE STATUS AND RESOURCES IT HAS NOT CHOSEN TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES OF REPARATIONS AND ASSISTING THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY TO FEEL WHOLE AGAIN. AS I TALKED ABOUT A FEW WEEKS AGO, WE ARE STILL LOOKING FOR PLANS OF REPARATION FOR THE HURTING BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITY FROM THE MARIJUANA TAX THIS CAN AND SHOULD BE DONE. IT'S HAPPENED ALREADY AND ASSISTANCE CAN BEGIN NOW. WE DON'T NEED TO WAIT. AN ACTION PLAN THAT WORKS CAN BE SEEN IN ILLINOIS, WHERE THEY LAUNCHED A CAMPAIGN TO BEGIN PUBLICLY FUNDING REPARATION THROUGH THE MARIJUANA TAX. THE CITY PROMISED $10 MILLION TO HELP STIMULATE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND PROVIDE HOUSING ASSISTANCE FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN CITIZENS. ON THE CONVERSATION OF HOUSING ASSISTANCE, ANOTHER THING FOR CONSIDERATION COULD BE HOUSING ALLIANCES. HOUSING IN ANN ARBOR IS UNBELIEVABLY EXPENSIVE. A SUGGESTION FOR -- WOULD BE FOR ALL OF YOU TO ACCEPT NAMES RAFFLE STYLE AND PAY FOR PEOPLE'S HOUSING THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. THINGS CAN BE DONE WHILE WE WAIT FOR BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY, YET THEY ARE NOT. WE CAN CHOOSE TO CLOSE THE WEALTH GAP IN ANN ARBOR ONE PERSON AT A TIME AND YOU GUYS HAVE THE POWER TO DO IT. WE HOPE THAT YOU GUYS WILL TAKE THIS CONSIDERATION SERIOUSLY AND THAT YOU WILL STILL PUSH VERY HARD FOR REPARATIONS IN THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. IT'S VITA VITAL THAT WE DO SO BE THE CITY IS HURTING AND THEY WANT TO BE HELPED AND BE MADE WHOLE AGAIN AND ONLY YOU, THE ELECTED OFFICIALS OF THE CITY CAN TAKE THAT KIND OF POWER AND PUT IT TO GOOD USE. SO THANK YOU FOR LISTENING. AGAIN, I WANT TO REITERATE THAT WE AS WHITE PEOPLE IN THIS CITY HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO USE OUR PRIVILEGE TO HELP OUR BLACK AND BROWN BROTHERS AND SISTERS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
