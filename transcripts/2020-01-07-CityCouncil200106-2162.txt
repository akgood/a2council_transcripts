00:01:35.095: >> WE DO. YOU WILL NOTICE I'M NOT HOWARD LAZARUS. I'M THE ASSISTANT CITY ADMINISTRATOR. MR. LAZARUS SENDS HIS REGARDS. HE'S OUT OF THE STATE, CELEBRATING BIRTH OF HIS FIRST GRAND CHILD. AND YOU ARE ALL STUCK WITH ME TONIGHT. I WANT TO LET YOU KNOW TOMORROW THERE WILL BE A COMMUNITY MEETING AT THE PITTSFIELD TOWNSHIP HALL REGARDING AN AMENDMENT TO THE P.U.D. AT THE LANDFILL FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF A SOLAR POWER PLANT. THAT MEETING WILL START AT 7:00. SO PLEASE BE THERE IF YOU ARE INTERESTED. AND LASTLY, I WOULD LIKE TO THANK OFFICER TRAVIS KELLER FOR BEING HERE TONIGHT TO GRACE US WITH HIS PRESENCE AT TONIGHT'S CITY COUNCIL MEETING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MR. MAYOR.
00:02:18.705: >> Mayor Taylor: THERE ARE NO INTRODUCTIONS TODAY. WE NOW COME TO PUBLIC COMMENT RESERVE TIME. PUBLIC COMMENT RESERVE TIME IS ITEM FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO SPEAK TO THE COUNCIL AND THE COMMUNITY ABOUT MATTERS OF INTEREST. YOU MUST SIGN UP IN ADVANCE BY CONTACTING THE CITY CLERK. SPEAKERS HAVE THREE MINUTES IN WHICH TO SPEAK. SO PLEASE PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE TIME CLOSE. AS A MATTER OF THE COURTESY, WE MAY ONLY HAVE ONE PERSON SPEAKING AT A TIME. IF YOU REQUIRE ASSISTANCE IF IN SPEAKING BEFORE COUNCIL TODAY, WE WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO PROVIDE IT TO YOU. OUR FIRST SPEAKER IS RALPH McGEE.
00:02:54.474: >> MY NAME IS RALPH McGEE, 5th WARD. I SENT TWO EMAILS RECENTLY YOU IN THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS ON THE SHORT-TERM RENTAL TOPIC. I WILL CALL THAT S.T.R., WHICH I HAVE OR HOPE YOU WILL READ. THEY COVER A LOT OF POINTS. I WOULD LIKE TO FOCUS ON A COUPLE OF TONIGHT. FIRST OFF, I SUPPORT ESSENTIALLY OPTION THREE IN YOUR CONSULTANT REPORT, WHICH WOULD ALLOW HOMEOWNERS WHICH I WILL CALL P.R.s, PRINCIPAL RESIDENCE, TO RENT THEIR SPARE ROOMS AND THE WHOLE HOUSE WHEN THEY ARE AWAY FOR UP TO 60 DAYS A YEAR BUT BANNING NON-P.R. WHOLE HOUSE S.T.R.s FOR THREE REASONS. ONE, THE NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE HOUSING MARKET; TWO, PROLIFERATION OF PARTY HOUSES; AND THREE, HURTING NEIGHBORHOOD CHARACTER. LET'S FOCUS ON THE HOUSING FIRST. ALL OF YOU HAVE AGREED THAT WE HAVE AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS. IT'S BEYOND DISPUTE THAT EVERY HOUSE WHICH TURNS INTO A NON-P.R. WHOLE HOUSE S.T.R. IS ONE LESS HOUSE FOR PEOPLE TO RENT OR BUY. THE S.T.R. PROPONENTS THAT I HAVE HEARD SPEAK OR WRITE OR ARGUE THAT WE DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT THE EFFECT ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING, AND THEREFORE, WE SHOULDN'T REGULATE YET, WE SHOULD ANALYZE MORE DATA. I FIND THAT ARGUE. DISINGENUOUS AND MADE IN BAD FAITH. THE ONLINE PLATFORMS REFUSE TO PROVIDE ANY MEANINGFUL DATA AND THE ARGUE. WE SHOULD WAIT UNTIL WE ANALYZE THE SAME DATA IS A CLASSIC CATCH 22 AND SHOULD BE REJECTED FOR THAT REASON ALONE. FURTHER, MANY OF YOU HAVE OFTEN CONTENDED THAT ADDING NEW HOUSING WILL INEVITABLY LEAD TO LOWER PRICES IN RENTS. SO IF YOU REMOVE HUNDREDS OF HOUSES FROM THE RENTALS OR SALE MARKET, THAT HAS TO BE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE IN A PRICING CONTEXT. THERE'S NO OTHER LOGICAL WAY TO LOOK AT IT. SOME S.T.R. PROPONENTS, SHIFTING GEARS HERE HAVE OFTEN ARGUED THAT REGULATION WILL HURT THEIR INVESTMENT IN NON-P.R. S.T.R.s, I DON'T THINK THAT'S TRUE. FIRST, THE UNDERLYING PROPERTIES CAN BE RENTED LONG TERM, OR SOLD PROFITABLY, DOES ANY KNOW OF ANY HOUSES THAT WENT DOWN IN VALUE OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS? AND ALSO SEVERAL CITIES HAVE BANNED THEM IN THE LAST FEW YEARS, SO INVESTORS KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BEFORE BUYING PROPERTIES OF THE RISK OF REGULATION. THAT'S BASKETBALL OUT  -- THAT'N OUT THERE FOR A LONG TIME. AND I THINK THE REASON THAT THE PROPONENTS OF SUCH S.T.R.s ARE ARGUING SO STRONGLY AGAINST A BAN OF THEM IS THAT THEY HAVE A -- AN UNFAIR COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE, NONLEVEL PLAYING FIELD SINCE THEY ARE NOT PAYING HOTEL, OCCUPANCY TAXES WHILE THEY ARE, IN FACT, RUNNING A HOTEL. FINALLY, THE ARGUMENT THAT I HAVE HEARD ALSO THAT NON-P.R. S.T.R.s ARE NECESSARY TO PROVIDE HOUSING FOR SPECIFIC NEEDS FOR HOSPITAL PATIENTS OR ACADEMIC VISITORS, THAT'S A WEAK ARGUMENT. UNDER THIS PROPOSAL, OPTION THREE, THIS WOULD BE PLENTY OF HOME RENTAL AND S.T.R. ROOMS AVAILABLE.
00:06:02.662: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS NOAH HOFFMAN.
00:06:07.967: >> THANK YOU. I'M A RESIDENT OF ANN ARBOR AND I'M A SHORT-TERM RENTAL HOST AND I HAVE BEEN DOING SO FOR ABOUT TWO YEARS. I HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING ALL AVAILABLE GUIDELINES AND REGULATIONS TO OFFER OUR GUESTS A TERRIFIC EXPERIENCE. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, I HAVE GONE ABOVE AND BEYOND TO BE A GREAT NEIGHBOR. I HAVE INVESTED TO DO THIS LEGALLY. AND I'M HERE TODAY BECAUSE THE PROPOSED LEGISLATION AS DEFINED IN THE MEMO, SPECIFICALLY OPTION THREE THREATENS TO CAUSE SEVERE ECONOMIC STRESS TO ALL INVOLVED NOT JUST HOSTS BUT OUR GUESTS AND A BROAD NETWORK OF CLEANERS AND HANDYMEN, RESTAURANTS AND VENDORS IN ANN ARBOR. NOW, THIS DISCUSSION BEGAN WITH A DISCUSSION ABOUT NEIGHBORHOOD SAFETY. THERE WERE SEVERAL OTHER ISSUES COMMUNICATED BY STAKEHOLDERS AND I AGREE, THOSE ISSUES NEED TO BE THOUGHT ABOUT. AS WE THINK ABOUT ADDRESSING ANY ISSUES, MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS, IS THAT THE STAKEHOLDERS' CONCERNS ARE VOICED AND PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED AND SOLUTIONS PROPOSED AND ULTIMATELY LAWS ARE ADOPTED. AFTER HOLDING THREE PUBLIC MEETINGS AND OPENING UP THE PROPOSED RESOLUTION FOR PROPOSED PUBLIC COMMENT ONLINE, IT'S RESOUNDING THAT LESS REGULATION, NOT MORE IS WHAT IS WARRANTED HERE. IT'S WHAT IS VOICED REPEATEDLY THAT THE RIGHT DATA HAS NOT BEEN USED TO COME TO ANY CONCLUSIONS ON WHAT THE ISSUES ACTUALLY ARE. OF THE 60 COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE TO OPPOSE OR SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION, ONLINE, ONLY ONE HAS BEEN IN SUPPORT WHILE 59 HAVE OPPOSED. THE BOTTOM LINE IS WE SHOULD PUT ORDINANCES IN PLACE THAT ACCOMPLISH WHAT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE, BASED ON THE DATA AND THE OPINIONS VOICED. ONLY RECENTLY AND VERY DISCREETLY, THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR HAS APPARENTLY DECIDED THAT SHORT-TERM RENTALS FALL INTO A SPECIAL CATEGORY, THAT THEY FEEL HAS PRECEDENT BASED ON CERTAIN CASE LAW IN MICHIGAN. BUT THE USE FOR AND THE INTERPRETATION OF ZONING CODES SHOULD BE BASED ON WHAT THE FOLKS WHO LIVE IN THE AREAS IN QUESTION ACTUALLY WANT. AND IT IS OVERWHELMINGLY CLEAR THAT THE INTERPRETATION OF THE SHORT-TERM RENTAL AS A COMMERCIAL BUSINESS GOES AGAINST THE WILL OF THE COMMUNITY, AND AS YOU AS CITY COUNCILMEMBERS HAVE A DUTY TO REPRESENT US, WE ASK THAT YOU DIRECT THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR TO DRAFT LEGISLATION BASED ON OPTION ONE IN THE CARLISLE WARD MEMO, BASED ON THE OPINIONS THE COMMUNITY. AS A FINAL THOUGHT, PERMITS AND ACCOUNTABILITY WILL MAKE THIS CITY SAFER. PERMITS WILL PROVIDE CRUCIAL DATA FOR THE CITY ACCOUNTABILITY, FOR THOSE WHO RENT ON A SHORT-TERM BASIS, AND A DIRECT PROCESS FOR PENALIZING NEGLIGENT HOSTS, AS YOU WOULD ANY NEIGHBOR OR LANDLORD. I THINK WE ALL LEARNED A LOT FROM THIS DISCUSSION AND THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF TALK AND I REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING A COMMON SENSE RESOLUTION ADOPTED. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
00:09:13.252: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS CAROL SCALA.
00:09:18.791: >> I APOLOGIZE. I HAVE TO READ THIS FROM MY PHONE. I DON'T HAVE A PAPER COPY. AT AN INFORMAL MEETING YESTERDAY, A WELL-RESPECTED CITIZEN NONOWNER COMMENTED THAT THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE CARLISLE REPORT WERE NOTHING SHORT OF DRACONIAN. I AGREE. THE REPORT IS THE REFUSAL TO ACCEPT THAT OUR CITIES ARE DYNAMIC, EVOLVING AND EVERCHANGINGEN ATHE TRAVEL WORLD IS NO DIFFERENT. OUR NEIGHBORHOODS ARE CHANGING TOO, CONSTANTLY. IF ANN ARBOR WANTS TO CONTINUE TO PRESENT ITSELF TO THE WORLD AS PROGRESSIVE, INCLUSIVE, DIVERSE, AND A GREAT PLACE TO VISIT, HOME STAYS NEED TO BE A PART OF THE HOUSING LANDSCAPE. THE NEED IS EVEN GREATER, CONSIDERING THAT WE ARE ONE OF THE GREATEST MEDICAL CARE CITIES IN THE WORLD. S.T.R.s ARE NOT A BLIGHT ON THE CITY AND THE CURRENT IMPACT IS INSIGNIFICANT EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT SOME PEOPLE JUST DON'T LIKE THEM AND DON'T WANT THEM HERE. IT'S INSULTING TO INSINUATE THAT MY COMPLETELY RENOVATED HOME IS A BLIGHT ON MY STREET BUT THE HOUSE FOUR DOORS DOWN FROM ME THAT IS OVERGROWN TO THE POINT OF OBLIVION AND OCCUPIED BY A HOARDER IS NOT. WHAT IS BEING DONE ABOUT THESE TRULY BLIGHTED PROPERTIES? S.T.R.s REPRESENT A MINUSCULE PERCENTAGE OF FAMILY HOMES IN THE CITY. S.T.R. OWNERS WANT TO WORK WITH COUNCIL, TO CRAFT, FOLLOWY ISES THAT ARE REASONABLE AND FAIR. MANY CITIES HAVE SUCCESSFULLY DONE THIS AND ANN ARBOR HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE A BELLWEATHER CITY IN THIS EFFORT. NOT BY INDISCRIMINANTLY SLAMMING THE DOOR ON RENTALS BUT FINDING CREATIVE SOLUTIONS THAT WORK FOR EVERYONE. AT CAUCUS YESTERDAY, IT WAS MENTIONED THAT NONOWNER OCCUPIED S.T.R.s WILL BE PROPOSED TO COUNCIL AS A VIOLATION OF THE RESIDENTIAL ZONING ORDINANCE AND THAT FOR THIS REASON ALONE, THEY SHOULD BE BANNED BECAUSE THEY ARE A BUSINESS OPERATING IN A RESIDENTIAL ZONE. HOW IN THE WORLD WOULD COUNCIL PROPOSE BANNING ALL BUSINESSES CURRENTLY BEING RUN OUT OF SINGLE FAMILY HOMES IN THE CITY? THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF THEM. YOU CAN'T DISCRIMINATE THESE SERVICE BUSINESSES AGAINST S.T.R.s. IF THEY ARE TRANSACTING BUSINESS MAKING MONEY, THEY ARE A BUSINESS. ANY OF THESE PROFESSIONALS HAVE COMINGS AND GOINGS IN THE COURSE OF BUSINESS AND ALL OF THEM ARE EXPECTED TO COMPLY WITH NUISANCE ORDINANCES LIKE TRASH, NOISE AND PARKING IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS. S.T.R.s ARE NO DIFFERENT. THIS ENTIRE PROCESS HAS BEEN A RUSH TO JUDGMENT. PLEASE MOVE TO TABLE THIS RECOMMENDATION FOR FURTHER STUDY WITH RELIABLE AND UNBIASED DATA AND HOPEFULLY DRAFT AN ORDINANCE THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR AT LEAST A GRANDFATHERING OF THE EXISTING S.T.R.s OR A CAP ON S.T.R. REGULATION TO BE FAIR AND EQUITABLE TO BOTH SIDES INVOLVED. AND THE FINAL QUESTION TO COUNCIL IS THIS, IF YOU USE EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU, S.T. R.s IN YOUR TRAVELINGS -- AND I KNOW THAT SOME OF YOU DO, IS THIS NOT A CLEAR EXAMPLE OF NOT IN MY BACKYARD?
00:12:26.746: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS SHANNON HATUCOMI.
00:12:39.358: >> HAUTOMAKI. I LOVE IN LOWER BURNS PARK. I WOULD LIKE TO ENCOURAGE COUNCIL TO PASS THIS CONSENT AGENDA ITEM TO BEGIN THE WORK OF REGULATING SHORT-TERM RENTALS. SO IN JULY, I WAS SEXUALLY ASSAULTED ON THE SIDEWALK OF ROSE AVENUE BY A MAN WHILE I WAS WALKING TO ROSE WAY PARK IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD. THE HOUSE THE MAN WAS STAYING IN ALSO ON ROSE AVENUE IS BEING USED EXCLUSIVELY FOR SHORT-TERM RENTALS. THE OWNERS OF THIS HOUSE HAVE NOT EXPRESSED ANY REMORSE FOR WHAT HAS HAPPENED. THEY LIVE IN FRANCE F FULL TIME. THEY DON'T FEEL ABOUT ME. THEY ARE NOT HERE TO SEE THE PAPPANE AND THE REAL ANXIETY. I THINK EVERYONE IS AWARE OF UNREGULATED HOTELS TO BE RUN IN RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS. I WAPPED TO TELL TELL YOU ABOUT THE NEIGHBORHOOD I REALLY LOVE. MY HUSBAND AND I WERE FORTUNATE TO START A FAMILY IN LOW BUPA. WE HAVE A 4-YEAR-OLD AND 2-YEAR-OLD. WE HAVE ONE CAR. SO THE KIDS AND I RIDE THE BUS OFTEN TO THE LIBRARY, THE HANDS ON MUSEUM AND THE FIRST STEP CLASSES. WE ARE REGULARS AT AUGUST FARM START AND ROOSEVELT COFFEE ON SOUTH INDUSTRIAL. WE BUY PRELOVED CLOTHES FROM SALVATION ARMY AND GROCERY'S FROM LUCKY'S MARKET. I THINK I GOT EVERYBODY. WE NEARLY ALWAYS WALK OR BIKE TO ALL OF THESE PLACES. THIS ALL MY OLDEST WILL ATTEND BURNS PARK ELEMENTARY WHERE WE WILL WALK OR BIKE TO SCHOOL EVERY DAY. THE NEED FOR ANOTHER CAR MY FAMILY WILL PEOPLE EVEN LESS. I LOVE THIS CAR LIGHT LIFESTYLE MY NEIGHBORHOOD ALLOWS BUT I SEE IT BECOMING MUCH HARDER FOR OTHERS TO OBTAIN BECAUSE OF THESE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES USED EXCLUSIVELY FOR SHORT-TERM RENTALS. THERE ARE OUT-OF-STATE INVESTORS TARGETING OUR NEIGHBORHOOD BECAUSE OF THE CLOSENESS TO MICHIGAN STADIUM. THEY ARE DISPLACING THE PEOPLE WHO WOULD LOVE TO LIVE IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO FULLY USE ALL THE HOUSING IN THE CITY AND THE DOWNTOWN ADJACENT NEIGHBORHOODS ESPECIALLY IF WE WANT TO HOPE TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN REDUCING OUR COLLECTIVE CARBON FOOTPRINT. I THINK A BAN ON INVESTMENT PROPERTIES IS WHOLLY APPROPRIATE. THESE ARE THE MOST PROBLEMATIC OF ANY OF THE SHORT-TERM RENTALS BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT ACCOUNTABLE TO THEIR NEIGHBORS. THEY DON'T HAVE TO SEE THEM EVERY DAY AND THEY ARE THE ONLY ONES WHO CONTRIBUTE TO THE CURRENT HOUSING CRISIS. I'M NOT TRYING TO COMPLETELY GET RID OF S.T.R.s ARE THE BENEFITS THEY PROVIDE TO SOME PEOPLE AND OWNERS, AND I DON'T WANT TO HAVE OUR NEIGHBORHOODS DECIMATED WHERE NO ONE LIVES THIS IN THE WINTER. THANK YOU.
00:15:29.228: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS KATHY STRAUB. MY APOLOGIES. THANK YOU. MY NEXT SPEAKER IS CAROL STRAUB.
00:15:42.975: >> ACTUALLY MY NAME IS KATHY.
00:15:45.711: >> Mayor Taylor: OH, GOODNESS. IS IT YOU?
00:15:48.347: >> YES, MY NAME IS KATHY STRAKEN.
00:15:56.589: >> I WAS HERE LAST NIGHT, THAT S.T.R.s HAVE MORE NUANCE ISSUES AND AFFECT AVAILABILITY AND AFFORDABILITY OF HOUSING IN ANN ARBOR WAS OPTION THREE WAS PRESENTED AS THE COURSE TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES. AT CAUCUS, COUNCILMAN ALI SHARED A DISCUSSION HE HAD WITH STAFF, AND IT WAS REALLY THE ZONING ORDINANCE THAT IS CENTRAL TO THE BAN ON NONOWNER OCCUPIED S.T. R.s. WOW! THIS IS QUITE A BAIT AND SWITCH. WHEN THE SMOKE SCREEN OF NUISANCE AND AFFORDABILITY WAS CHALLENGED ON THE BASIS OF DATA AND FACTS, A NEW REASON WAS PRESENTED. WHEN THE PROPOSAL FOR 616 WASHINGTON THE TALLEST BUILDING TO BE BUILT IN ANN ARBOR IN 50 YEARS WAS BROUGHT BEFORE COUNCIL, MANY MEMBERS FELT IT WAS NOT FAIR TO IMPOSE NEW RULES AFTER THE FACT. THESE SHORT-TERM OWNERS HAVE FOLLOWED THE RULES BY REGISTERING THEIR PROPERTIES, GETTING INSPECTED, OBTAINING CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCIES AND WITH NO PROBLEM. THE ZONING ORDINANCE WAS NEVER BROUGHT UP AS AN ISSUE. WHAT CHANGED? LIKE, WHAT HAPPENED? WHAT IS THE REASON THAT SHORT-TERM RENTALS ARE NOW UNDER ATTACK? WHAT IS THE HIDDEN BACK STORY HERE? WE FEEL THAT WE HAVE BEEN MISLED AND THAT SOMEONE HAS AN AGENDA OUT TO BAN S.T.R.s. THE COMMUNITY WEBSITE AS SOMEONE MENTIONED HAS 60 COMMENTS ON IT, ONLY ONE OPPOSING THE RESOLUTION. AND CREATING THE REGULATION ACCORDING TO OPTION THREE. BANNING S.T.R.s IS NOT THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE FROM THE COMMUNITY MEETINGS THAT I ATTENDED, AND IT HAS NOT BEEN EXPRESSED ON THE COMMUNITY WEBSITE. THE REASONS FOR OPPOSING ARE VARIED AND CLEARLY ARTICULATED. IN APRIL OF 2019, MLIVE REPORTED THAT RESIDENTIAL LOTS WERE REZONED ALONG HOOVER AND DAVIS AVENUES WEST OF MAIN FOR MULTIPLE FAMILY TO SINGLE FAMILY. THE OUTCOME WAS PROPERTIES THAT HAVE OPERATED AS MULTIPLE FAMILY RENTALS CAN CONTINUE IN THE SAME MANNER UNDER THE SINGLE FAMILY ZONING, AS THEY WERE GRANDFATHERED IN ACCORDING TO BRETT LEINART THE CITY PLANNING MANAGER. WE SHOULD GRANDFATHER IN THE CURRENT S.T. R.s WHERE THEY CURRENTLY EXIST. FROM MY CURRENT PERSPECTIVE AS A HOMEOWNER, I LIVE IN WARD ONE. IF I WANT TO RENT OUT MY HOME RESIDENCE FOR A FEW DAYS, I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO HAVE MY HOME INSPECTED. IT SENDS A MESSAGE TO A GUEST STAYING AT MY HOUSE THAT THEY NEED TO BE PROTECTED FROM AN UNSAFE HOUSE THAT I'M CURRENTLY LIVING IN. AND I ASK THAT YOU SUPPORT OPTION ONE FOR THE SHORT-TERM RENTAL REGULATION. THANK YOU.
00:18:42.154: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS KATHY STRAUB.
00:18:48.127: >> GOOD EVENING. I WAS HERE LAST NIGHT, AND FOR THE FIRST CAUCUS, I HAVE EVER ATTENDED FOR CITY COUNCIL. BY THE WAY I LIVE AT 2271 PLACID WAY, ANN ARBOR, 111. I WAS HERE LAST NIGHT. THERE WERE FOUR OF YOU HERE. IT WAS A GREAT DISCUSSION! I MEAN, WE WERE HERE FOR TWO HOURS AND AT LEAST OVER AN HOUR WAS ON THIS ISSUE. AND I MET SOME WONDERFUL PEOPLE WHO ARE HERE TONIGHT, WHO ARE NOT ON -- NOT ON MY -- THEY DON'T THINK EXACTLY THE WAY I THINK, BUT WE'RE NOT ON OPPOSITE PLACES. WE ALL ARE FOR YOU PASSING THE DIRECTION TONIGHT THAT YOU LOOK INTO REGULATIONS OR THAT YOU INSTRUCT YOUR STAFF TO LOOK INTO REGULATIONS, WHETHER IT'S OPTION ONE, OPTION TWO, OPTION THREE, OR OPTION FOUR OR SOMETHING ELSE. THOSE OF US THAT HAVE BEEN IN GOVERNMENT FOR MANY YEARS -- YOU I WAS ON THE COUNTY BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS FROM 1972 TO 1980, WE UNDERSTAND ZONING LAW AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE PEOPLE IN ANN ARBOR HAVE SPOKEN. THE PEOPLE IN ANN ARBOR HAVE SAID, WE WANT A REGULATED COMMUNITY. WE DON'T WANT GAS STATIONS NEXT TO OUR HOUSES. WE DON'T WANT MULTIUNIVERSITY HOUSING IN OUR RESIDENTIAL AREAS. WE WANT A ZONING LAW THAT SAYS ONLY FOUR UNRELATED PEOPLE MAY LIVE IN A HOME. FOR ALL KINDS OF REASONS. THIS NEEDS TO PASS TONIGHT. AND THE DETAILS ARE GOING TO BE WORKED OUT LATER. SO PLEASE PASS THE INSTRUCTING STAFF TO GO AHEAD WITH THIS. THANK YOU.
00:20:36.969: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS MOZHAN.
00:20:48.080: >> I HAVE SPOKEN AGAINST THE PLAN TO PUT GELMAN CONTAMINATION SITE ON A SUPERFUND LIST AND I HAVE GIVEN YOU THE REASONS WHY. IT TAKES UP TO 30 YEARS FOR SITES THAT ARE ALREADY ON THE EPA LIST TO BE CLEANED UP. IF WE WANT TO GO THAT ROUTE, IT'S BASICALLY JUST BEING FORCED TO WAIT FOR A VERY LONG TIME, IF IT COMES TO BE CLEANED. I KNOW THAT COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER LAST OCTOBER TOLD US THAT THE MORE HE LEARNS ABOUT THIS SITUATION, THE MORE HE REALIZES THAT WE MIGHT HAVE TO CLEAN UP THIS CONTAMINATION OURSELVES. I WANT TO INVITE HIM TO PLEASE ELABORATE ON THAT. WHAT HAS HE LEARNED THAT HAS BROUGHT HIM TO THIS CONCLUSION, AND WE WE WILL KNOW BETTER. FROM MY SIDE, I KNOW HAVING WORKED ON EPA SITES THAT ARE CONTAMINATED, I KNOW EVEN IF THE SITE IS ON THE LIST OF SUPERFUND SITES, IT WILL TAKE DECADES BEFORE THE EPA GETS AROUND TO DOING IT. AT THIS STAGE, WHEN EPA IS BASICALLY AN ORGANIZATION THAT SUPPORTS POE HUTTERS, I VERY MUCH DOUBT -- POLLUTERS, I VERY MUCH DOUBT THIS WILL BE A WAY TO GO WITH. IT WILL MAKE YOU LOOK LIKE YOU ARE BUSY, BUT YOU ARE NOT GOING THE RIGHT WAY. SINCE THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT A FEW DAYS AGO, ASSASSINATED AN IRANIAN GENERAL, WHO HAS BEEN THE SAVIOR OF THE ENTIRE REGION, BY DEFEATING ISIS -- AND I AM ORIGINALLY FROM IRAN -- I FEEL I NEED TO MAKE A STATEMENT HERE. THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT JUST ASSASSINATED A MAN THAT WAS LOVED ACROSS THE MIDDLE EAST FOR HIS EFFORTS AND SUCCESS IN REMOVING I ISIS FROM THE AREA. ISIS WAS PROMOTED AND AROUNDED BY THE UNITED STATES. THE REASON WHY PEOPLE LOVE HIM IS BECAUSE HE PROTECTED THEIR CHILDREN FROM BEING RAPED BY ISIS. THEY PROTECTED PEOPLE FROM BEING DECAPITATED BY E ISIS. THIS MAN WAS LOVED. THE UNITED STATES ASSASSINATED HIM ILLEGALLY. THE REASON WHY I TALK ABOUT IT HERE TODAY IS BECAUSE THE RACISM THAT ALLOWED THIS CRIMINAL ACT TO HAPPEN, STARTS RIGHT HERE IN THESE CHAMBERS. EVERY TIME YOU STAND AGAINST MEASURES TO PROTECT LIVES OF ARABS, YOU ARE SAYING IT IS OKAY TO OKAY KILL ARABS AND IRANIANS. EVERY TIME YOU SAY NOTHING ABOUT ISRAEL AND THE MURDER OF PALESTINIANS, ARABS, EVERY TIME YOU SAY NOTHING ABOUT IT AND KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT, YOU ARE ALLOWING A RACISM IN THAT IN THE LONG RUN AND IN THE BIG PICTURE MURDERS AND ASSASSINATES ARABS, IRANIANS. YOU HAVE HAD MANY, MANY CHANCES AND MANY, MANY YEARS TO SPEAK UP AGAINST ISRAEL. I ASK YOU TO DO IT.
00:23:48.994: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
00:23:49.828: >> BOYCOTT ISRAEL. AT LEAST CUT OFF THE MILITARY AID TO THEM.
00:23:53.966: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS DAVID HALLMAN.
00:24:04.409: >> GOOD EVENING, I'M DAVID HALLMAN. I WANT TO THANK MR. MAYOR AND COUNCILMEMBERS AND THE STAFF FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK THIS EVENING. AND I DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS THE OFFICER THAT WALKED IN WITH ME, WE JUST SHARED AN ELEVATOR. DID HE NOT BRING ME TO THE MEETING. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M ASKING THAT CONSENT AGENDA ITEM NUMBER 1 BE REMOVED FROM THE CONSENT AGENDA AND BE LOOKED AT AS AN INDIVIDUAL ITEM. WE HAVE A CLAIM WITH THE CITY ON SEWER BACKUP THAT WAS OBVIOUSLY -- WE HAVE BEEN THE RECOMMENDATION WAS TO TURN US DOWN. WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH THE WHOLE STORY, WHAT HAPPENED, WHY IT HAPPENED:  IT'S NOT AN EASY CASE. WHAT I HAVE GOTTEN IS TWO LETTERS FROM YOUR SENIOR CLAIMS ADJUSTOR, WHO YOU CONTRACT FOR, BECAUSE YOU ARE SELF-INSURED AND YOU DON'T HAVE AN ADMINISTRATOR ON THE CITY PAYROLL. AND THAT PERSON WROTE ONE LETTER SAYING IT'S REJECTED. THE FOLKS THAT WERE HERE AT THE CAUCUS LAST NIGHT GOT COPIES OF THE LETTERS. SO IF YOU DON'T HAVE ONE, YOU DON'T HAVE THE WHOLE STORY. BUT BASICALLY WHAT SHE SAYS, IT'S A NUMBER OF REASONS, THE IMMUNITY THAT THE STATE SAYS IS BY STATUTE. WHAT WE ARE SAYING IS WE ARE IMMUNE. IF WE DON'T WANT TO PAY IT, WE DON'T PAY IT. WHETHER WE DESERVE TO OR WHETHER WE WERE WRONG, OR WHETHER THIS' A QUESTION OF LIABILITY, THE STATE OF MICHIGAN HOLDS US HARMLESS. AND SO YOU UNDERSTAND LORI O'MALLEY WHO SIGNED THE LETTERS AS YOUR ADMINISTRATOR HAS NEVER BEEN TO OUR HOME. I THINK SHE KNOWS HOW TO GET TO TOLEDO TO THE COMMISSION MEETINGS HERE. THAT'S IT. BUT SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT THE COMMISSION IS RECOMMENDING THAT IT BE TURNED DOWN. AND I GUESS THAT'S FINE. YOU HAVE A PLANNING COMMISSION. DO YOU APPROVE EVERY RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THE LAPPING COMMISSION GIVES YOU? I THINK NOT. ANN ARBOR IS A COMMUNITY OF RESIDENTS AND PEOPLE AND WE ARE RESIDENTS. WE HAVE BEEN PAYING TAXES ON THAT PROPERTY FOR OVER 25 YEARS, AND ALL WE ARE ASKING FOR IS A FAIR SHAKE. TO BE TREATED LIKE A FELLOW RESIDENT OF THE CITY. THANK YOU.
00:27:01.720: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. YOUR NEXT SPEAKER IS LAUREN TUTARSKI.
00:27:09.461: >> I HAD ALL. GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. MY NAME IS LAUREN TUTA RSKI, I'M A FORMER POLICE TASK FORCE MEMBER. THIS PROPOSAL IS PRESENTED IN A WAY THAT SEEMS TO MAKE IT -- THAT MAKES IT APPEAR LIKE A NEW OFFICER IS SOMETHING THAT THE I.C.U.P.C. HAD ASKED FOR OR WOULD BE BENEFICIAL TO THE COMMISSIONERS BUT THAT'S NOT THE CASE FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS. ONE, CURRENTLY, IT'S A RULE THAT THE STATE POLICE OFFER TRAINING TO THOSE WHO CAN HAVE ACCESS TO REPORTS. SO MICHIGAN STATE POLICE SHOULD EDIT THAT RULE TO ALLOW SOME COMMISSIONERS, THOSE WHO CHOOSE TO DO SO BASED ON THE FACT THAT THERE'S A BACKGROUND CHECK INVOLVED TO TAKE THE LEAN TRAINING AND ACCESS UNREACTED COMPLAINTS AND REPORTS THEMSELVES. IT IS SIMPLY COUNTERPRODUCTIVE AND ANTITHETICAL TO CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT TO NOT ALLOW FULL ACCESS BE GIVEN IF ACCESS TO REPORT LIES ABOUT THE POLICE'S JURISDICTION THEY WILL REDACT REPORTS BEFORE SHARING THEM WITH I.C.P.O.C. WHICH TAKES OUT CRITICAL INFORMATION NECESSARY FOR THE COMMISSIONERS TO HAVE ADEQUATE CONTEXT TO DO THEIR JOB. NUMBER THREE, THIS NEW HIRE WOULD ALSO SERVE TO EXPAND A.A.P.D.'S ATTEMPT AT COMMUNITY POLICING AND I WOULD LIKE TO NOW SHARE HOW COMMUNITY POLICING IS PROBLEMATIC. THE FOLLOWING WORDS ARE ALL TAKEN FROM PHYLLIS PARIS, A Ph.D. CANDIDATE AT YALE UNIVERSITY. ON THE SURFACE, COMMUNITY POLICING SOUNDS LIKE AN IDEAL WAY TO REFORM POLICING. BUT POLICE VIOLENCE TOWARDS BLACK PEOPLE HAS PERSISTED. A STUDY PUBLISHED BY THE JOURNAL BY EXPERIMENTAL CRIMINOLOGY, SUGGESTS THAT COMMUNITY POLICING DOES NOT SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE CRIME, OR MAKE COMMUNITIES SAFER. THE STRATEGY FURTHER FLOODS COMMUNITIES WITH POLICE AND LEGITIMIZES AN INSTITUTION THAT IS CENTERED ON PUNISHMENT AND CONTROL. POLICE IS EXTRA SURVEILLANCE OF THE RESIDENTS AS OPPOSED TO PROTECT. AS LONG AS POVERTY AND RACIAL INEQUALITY EXISTS, POVERTY WILL ALWAYS HAVE AFR AFR AFR AFRICANO HIGHER SURVEILLANCE. COMMUNITY POLICING SUGGESTS THAT THEY CAN SOLVE STRUCTURES BY BUILDING PARTNERSHIP BUT POLICING HAS MADE THESE ISSUES WORSE. POLICE DO NOT SPEAK TO THE WIDE RANGE OF CONCERNS THAT RESIDENTS HAVE, NOR SHOULD THEY TRY TO MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES NEED RESOURCES TO THRIVE. INVESTING IN COMMUNITY POLICING OR POLICING MORE BROADLY WILL NOT CHANGE UNDERLYING STRUCTURAL CONTEXT THAT LEADS TO A LACK OF SAFETY, NOR WILL IT CHANGE THE LAWS THAT CRIMINALIZE PEOPLE FOR BEING POOR AND DISADVANTAGES. THE SOLUTION, DIVERT FUNDS FOR ADDITIONAL POLICE PERSONNEL TOWARDS COMMUNITY-BASED SAFETY AND WELLNESS INITIATIVES SUCH AS ARTS AND ATHLETIC PROGRAMS, VIOLENCE INTERRUPTION, QUALITY SCHOOLS HAVING TRAINED RAPID RESPONSE TEAMS THAT CAN ADR. HE IS A WIDE RANGE OF EMERGENCIES WITHOUT POLICE PRESENCE. SO I SUGGEST THAT YOU TAKE THAT $100,000 AND CHANNEL IT INTO COMMUNITY RESOURCES. THANK YOU.
00:30:13.178: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS HENRY HERSKOWITZ.
00:30:24.789: >> GOOD EVENING. I WOULD LIKE TO EXPLAIN TO COUNCIL WHY OUR GROUP SELECTED BETH ISRAEL CONGREGATION AS THE APPROPRIATE VENUE FOR PROTESTS AGAINST THE JEWISH STATE. 16 YEARS AGO, WE WROTE, WE HOLD VIGILS OUTSIDE THE SYNAGOGUE BECAUSE BETH ISRAEL IS A HOUSE OF WORSHIP, USING ITS FAITH TO PROMOTE A NATIONALIST AGENDA. THEN IN 2007, RABBI DOBBERSON CONFIRMS THAT THE ENTIRE CONGREGATION SUPPORTED ISRAEL'S CLAIMED RIGHT TO EXIST AS A JEWISH STATE AND WE OPPOSE THAT CLAIM TO A RIGHT TO ETHNICALLY CLEANSE PALESTINE OF ITS NON-JEWISH INHABITANTS. WE NOTED THAT BETH ISRAEL FLIES A FOREIGN FLAG IN ITS SANCTUARY. AND MANY WAVE ISRAELI FLAGS AS THEY DRIVE INTO THE PARKING LOT. AND THAT SOME EVEN SPORT JEWISH-ISRAELI LICENSE PLATES. WE THEN RECOGNIZED THE GREAT INSIGHT INTO RACIAL DIFFERENCES BY MALCOLM X. HE SAID TO WHITE ACTIVISTS, THE NEGROES AREN'T THE RACISTS. WHERE THE REALLY SINCERE WHITE PEOPLE HAVE TO DO THE PROVING OF THEMSELVES IS NOT AMONG THE BLACK VICTIMS BUT HOW THERE ON THE BATTLE LINES WHERE OUR AMERICA'S RACISM REALLY IS AND THAT'S IN THEIR OWN HOME COMMUNITIES. LET'S REPHRASE THAT. THE PALESTINIANS AREN'T THE RACISTS. WHERE THE REALLY SINCERE JEWISH PEOPLE HAVE GOT TO DO THEIR PROVING OF THEMSELVES IS NOT AMONG PALESTINIAN VICTIMS BUT OUT THERE ON THE BATTLE LINES OF WHERE ISRAEL'S RACISM REALLY IS, AND THAT'S IN THEIR OWN JEWISH COMMUNITIES. THE SYNAGOGUE IS THE CORE OF THE JEWISH COMMUNITY. BETH ISRAEL IS CERTAINLY NO EXCEPTION. THE JEWISH CHEFFENNISM REFORMED THIS IS REFLECTED IN JEWISH HOLIDAYS WHERE JEWS ARE PORTRAYED AS VICTIMS OF AN ALLEGED HOSTILE WORLD. AN UNHEALTHY TOXIC PARADIGM OF US vs. THEM IS FORMED. IT IS A PARADIGM WHICH IS THE OPPOSITE OF THE UNIVERSAL EXPRESSED IN CHRISTIANITY. THE JEWISH COMMUNITY SELF-ISOLATES FROM THE OTHERS. CONSIDER SOME SIGNS IN FRONT OF LOCAL CHURCHES. BETHLEHEM CHURCH SAYS "GOD'S DOORS ARE OPEN TO ALL." FIRST CONGREGATIONAL SAYS, ALL ARE WELCOME. FIRST BAPTIST SAYS, OPEN TO ALL, CLOSED TO NONE. BUT SADLY, NOT SO AT BETH ISRAEL. ITS SUPPORT OF A SELF-ISOLATED STATE, JEWISH STATE MAKES IT THE LEGITIMATE VENUE FOR PROTEST. THANK YOU.
00:33:09.821: >> Mayor Taylor: ARE THERE COMMUNICATIONS FROM COUNCIL? COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
00:33:20.765: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I HAVE THREE THINGS. AND FIRST, I WANT TO ASK A QUESTION, AND ONE OF THE REASONS THAT I'M ASKING THIS IS BECAUSE OF THE OPEN MEETINGS ACT, WE REALLY CAN'T GET TOGETHER AND DISCUSS HOUSEKEEPING-TYPE ISSUES AS A GROUP. AND THAT IS COMMUNICATIONS. WHEN AN EMAIL COMES IN TO THE MAYOR AND ALL OF COUNCIL, COULD SOMEONE AT A FUTURE MEETING EXPLAIN EXACTLY WHAT THE RESPONSE IS FOR THAT? AND IS THERE A STANDARD RESPONSE? SO THAT'S MY QUESTION. BECAUSE AS A NEW COUNCILMEMBER, I REALLY DON'T KNOW. AND FOR THE PUBLIC, WE GET SOMETIMES 50 EMAILS IN A DAY. SO SOME OF THE MORE GENERIC ONES I'M ASSUMING THAT A STAFF MEMBER IS REPLYING TO THOSE BUT I WANT TO ENSURE. THAT ALSO REGARDING COMMUNICATIONS, I WANT TO THANK COUNCILMEMBER NELSON FOR HER NEWSLETTER AND FOR HER VOTING CHART. LAST WEEK, I HAD A NUMBER OF PEOPLE APPROACH ME AND ASK ME WHEN IS IT GOING TO BE OUT. SO THAT TELLS ME THAT IT'S VERY VALUABLE. SO THANK YOU. NUMBER TWO IS REALLY SHORT. IT'S ABOUT STREET LIGHTS. I HOPE WE FOCUS ON STREET LIGHTS THIS YEAR, ESPECIALLY AT CROSSWALKS. I HAVE BEEN TO A NUMBER OF THE MEETINGS LATELY AND PEOPLE -- I DON'T KNOW IF THEY RECOGNIZE ME AND THAT'S WHY THEY START TALKING ABOUT THE NEED FOR STREET LIGHTS OR IF THERE JUST IS A LEGITIMATE NEED BUT THAT'S GOOD. THE LAST THING IS I JUST WANT TO THANK EVERYONE IN THE AUDIENCE FOR COMING. SOMETIMES IT'S A BIT UNCOMFORTABLE, BUT WHAT HAVE YOU TO REALIZE IS THAT WE ARE MAKING TREMENDOUS PROGRESS AS A COUNCIL, AND AS A RESULT OF THAT, WE'RE ACCELERATING THAT PROCESS, AND THERE'S GOING TO BE MORE TENSION. AND I BELIEVE THAT IS A GOOD THING. AND I ALSO WANT TO THANK EVERYONE TO SUBMITTED ANALYSES REGARDING SHORT-TERM RENTALS. I WAS REALLY IMPRESSED BY THE PROFESSIONAL NATURE OF THOSE REPORTS REGARDLESS OF THE POSITION THAT PEOPLE TOOK. THEY SUPPORTED THEIR POSITIONS WITH DATA. THEY WERE VERY THOUGHTFUL AND FOR THAT, THANK YOU.
00:35:39.270: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
00:35:40.438: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. IT'S BEEN A FEW WEEKS. I WANTED TO WELCOME EVERYONE BACK AND WISH EVERYONE A HAPPY NEW YEAR. HOPEFULLY WE HAVE A GREAT START TO THE NEW YEAR, AND GET LOTS OF THINGS DONE BEFORE OUR BIG ELECTION LATER THIS YEAR. I WOULD LIKE TO CONGRATULATE OUR CITY ADMINISTRATOR, AND GIVE HIM BEST WISHES TO HIM AND HIS FAMILY TO BECOMING A GRANDPA. I HEARD THAT'S THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF HAVING KIDS, IS TO HAVE GRANDKIDS. [ LAUGHTER ] SO I JUST WANTED TO CONGRATULATE HIM AND HIS FAMILY.
00:36:12.837: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
00:36:13.705: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU. A COUPLE OF ANNOUNCEMENTS ON WATER ISSUES. TOMORROW IS THE FIRST CARD MEETING OF THE YEAR. JANUARY 7th FROM 6 TO 8 P.M. AT WASHTENAW THAT IS THE COALITION FOR THE REMEDIATION OF DIOXANE. ONE OF THE REASONS THAT I'M CONCERNS IS THAT IF YOU GO TO THE CARD MEETINGS AND YOU SEE THE DATA THAT'S BEEN COLLECTED OVER THE 30 SOME YEARS WE HAVE NO REAL PROGRESS ON THIS. THE THREE INTERVENING PARTIES TOGETHER, SPEND ABOUT $900 A DAY, 365 DAYS A YEAR ON LEGAL HELP WITH NOTHING TO SHOW FOR IT, REALLY NOTHING. AND THE CHARTS AND THE DATA SHOW THAT THIS JUST KEEPS CONTINUING TO SPREAD. I CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT -- THE UNFORTUNATE CONCLUSION THAT SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE AND WE MAY HAVE TO TAKE MATTER INTO OUR OWN HANDS AND IT MAY BE SOONER RATHER THAN LATER. WE'LL SEE HOW IT KEEPS GOING. THE FOLLOWING TUESDAY, JANUARY 14th FROM 5 TO 8 P.M. WITH WASHTENAW COMMUNITY COLLEGE BUILDING, THE M PART WHICH IS A MICHIGAN PFAS RESPONSE TEAM IS GOING TO BE TAKING A CITIZEN COMMENTS ON PFSAS RULES AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE STATE -- THE STATE IS TALKING ABOUT CREATING ITS OWN DRINKING WATER CRITERIA FOR PFAS AND WE KNOW WITH DIOXANE, THEY WOULD PROBABLY AGREE AND SAY THE SAME THING WITH PFAS THAT ZERO IS THE RIGHT AMOUNT TO HAVE IN THE DRINKING WATER. WITH OUR STATE AND OUR SHARED STATE WATERS, THAT'S -- THAT A'S NOT POSSIBLE, UNFOR THE -- THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE AND SO THEY ARE ASKING TO SET A STANDARD THAT CAN BE ENFORCED AND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT AND SO ANYBODY IS WELCOME TO DO THEIR PUBLIC COMMENTS AT THAT TIME. HELLO TO THE DEER CULL PEOPLE HERE. I'M SORRY I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO RESTRICT THIS BARBARIC PRACTICE. I HAVE ASKED TO OBSERVE THE PRACTICE AND INSTEAD I WAS OFFERED TO MEET WITH OUR VENDOR, EUPHEMISTICALLY CALLED VENDOR ON THIS PROCESS, WHICH DOESN'T GIVE ME ANY CONFIDENCE THAT WE HAVE REAL OVERSIGHT ON THIS ISSUE. I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THAT AND I WANTED TO SHARE MY CONCERNS WITH THE FOLKS HERE IN THE ROOM. ONE LAST THING. WELL, TWO LAST THINGS. WELL, I -- I AGREE WITH COUNCILWOMAN GRISWOLD ABOUT OUR NEED FOR STREET LIGHTING AND OTHER CONCERNS ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY AND THE SHARED TRANSIT CORRIDORS AND OVER THE YEARS, I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO OBSERVE, BIKES, PEDESTRIANS AND CARS AT LENGTH AS I SCOOTED AROUND TOWN IN MY VARIOUS MODES AND I HAVE SEEN SOME ABHORRENT BEHAVIORS BY ALL THREE OF THOSE VEHICLE MODES. WE SAW HERDS OF PEDESTRIANS CROSSING AGAINST THE LIGHT. ALL OVER THE HOLIDAYS. I DON'T KNOW IF DRINKING PLAYED A PART IN THAT. IT MIGHT HAVE. I HAVE SEEN MANY CARS GOING DOWN THE WILLIAMS STREET BIKE LANE. THERE'S A LOT OF CONFUSION AROUND WILLIAM AND ASHLEY AND FIRST AND WHAT'S GOING ON THERE, AND SO A LOT OF CARS TURNING OFF THE MAIN STREET AND DOWN THE BIKE LANE. I'M NOT SURE THAT THAT HAS IMPROVED BEHAVIOR. AND I ALSO HAD AN UNFORTUNATE EXPERIENCE WHERE CLEARLY A BIKE HOUND TYPE PERSON, A FULL GEAR PERSON WITH THE THING ON HIS HEAD AND THE CAMERA AND EVERYTHING, BLEW THE RED LIGHT ON CATHERINE AS WE WERE GOING ON 5th SOUTHBOUND, AND WHEN I ASKED MY PASSENGER TO ROLL HIS WINDOW DOWN SO I COULD GIVE HIM A FRIENDLY SHARE THE ROAD, INSTEAD, WE WERE GIVEN A STRING OF EXPLETIVES AND HAND GESTURES FROM THE CYCLISTS AS IF IT WAS MY FAULT FOR GOING THROUGH THE GREEN LIGHT. SO I QUESTION THIS NOTION OF SHARING THE ROAD. IF WE ARE GOING TO SHARE THE ROAD, THEN YOU SHARE THE RULES. AND THAT'S THE SAME FOR PEDESTRIANS AND BIKES AND CARS AND I JUST WANT TO HANG THAT OUT THERE. AND LASTLY, I'M SORRY ABOUT OUR WAR MONGERING AND PROFITTERRING WITH IRAN. I WANT TO SEND OUT A SHOUT OUT TO MY WIFE IN RWANDA, WOULD IS INSPECTING ORGANIC TEA PLANTATIONS AND I WISH HER WELL IN GETTING HOME. THANK YOU.
00:40:18.449: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER COMMUNICATION FROM COUNCIL. COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
00:40:21.819: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. I WISH EVERYONE A HAPPY NEW YEAR AND I THANK EVERYONE FOR COMING OUT TONIGHT. IT'S GREAT TO START OFF OUR YEAR WITH SO MUCH PARTICIPATION. I WANT TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY -- I DON'T THINK IT'S TOO LATE, BECAUSE IT STARTED JUST TODAY -- TO THINK ABOUT JOINING THE 21-DAY EQUITY CHALLENGE FROM THE UNITED WAY OF WASHTENAW COUNTY AND LOTS OF OTHER PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS. YOU CAN FIND INFORMATION ABOUT THAT ON THE UNITED WAY OF WASHTENAW COUNTY'S WEBSITE AND A NUMBER OF OTHER PARTNER ORGANIZATION WEBSITES AND THERE ARE FLYERS DOWNSTAIRS AT OUR WELCOME DESK, IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN GETTING SOME MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THAT. I THINK IT'S A TERRIFIC WAY TO START OFF THE NEW YEAR WITH SOME QUALITY AND COMMUNITY REFLECTION. AND ALSO I WANT TO THANK THE ANN ARBOR POLICE DEPARTMENT, AND CHIEF COX. I HAD THE PLEASURE OF JOINING MEMBERS OF MY RELIGIOUS COMMUNITY TO CELEBRATE H HANUKKH IN DECEMBER AND WE WERE JOINED BY MANY MEMBERS OF THE ANN ARBOR POLICE DEPARTMENT, WHICH I KNOW AT LIBERTY PLAZA WHICH ENABLED EVERYONE TO CELEBRATE SAFELY AND SHARE IN SOME OF OUR CUSTOMS AND LETTING SOME LIGHT INTO THE SEASON. SO THANK YOU.
00:41:43.401: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
00:41:44.402: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I HESITATED WHETHER OR NOT TO SAY ANYTHING IN RESPONSE TO MR. HERSKOWITZ'S COMMENT. HE WAS LAST PERSON TO SPEAK TO CITY COUNCIL AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT I MAKE A COMMENT IN RESPONSE, NOT ONLY BECAUSE BETH ISRAEL IS A CONGREGATION SITS WITHIN THE 3rd WARD AND I REPRESENT THE 500 RESIDENTS AND MEMBERS THE CONGREGATION. ALSO BECAUSE I GREW UP IN THE CONGREGATION. I HAD MY BAR MITZVAH THERE AND I WENT TO HEBREW THERE AND MY PARENTS WERE MEMBERS OF THE CONGREGATION FOR OVER A DECADE. ANTI-SEMITISM IN MODERN AMERICA IS NOT USING THE WORD KIKE OR DRAWING CARICATURES OF BANKERS WITH BIG NOSES THE ANTI-SEMITISM LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE MR. HERSKWITZ. IT LOOKS LIKE EMBEDDING DISTRUST IN YOUR NEIGHBORS. I'M NOT ACCUSING YOU OF ANYTHING. I'M ACCUSING MR. HERSKOWITZ AS BEING ANTISEMITE AND PROTESTING A HOUSE OF WORSHIP FOR THE LAST 16 YEARS AS RACIST AND ANTI-SEMITIC. AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO CALL OUT WHAT ANTISEMITISM IN AMERICA IS TODAY IS CALLING INTO QUESTION OUR LOYALTY AS AMERICANS AND ALSO MEMBERS OF THE JEWISH FACE. IT MEANS CALLING INTO QUESTION THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE WHO DIED IN THE HOLOCAUST TO QUESTION THE LEGITIMACY OF ANY CLAIMS OVER ANYTHING. IT MEANS USING --
00:43:22.800: >> THIS IS A HOLOCAUST!
00:43:26.337: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  IT MEANS -- IT MEANS USING THE WORD JEWISH OR JEW, NO MORE OR NO LESS THAN 15 TIMES IN YOUR COMMENTS TO CITY COUNCIL WHILE DRAWING COMPARISONS OF THE JEWISH FAITH TO THE CHRISTIAN FAITH AND THE SUPERIORITY OF THE CHRISTIAN FAITH. ANTI-SEMITISM EXISTS IN OUR COMMUNITY. IT LOOKS LIKE MR. HERSKOWITZ AND ANY TIME WHILE HE COMES UP TO SPEAK WHILE I'M STILL IN OFFICE, I WILL MAKE SURE EVERYONE IN THE ROOM KNOWS WHO HE IS AND WHAT HE STANDS FOR.
00:44:04.542: >> I BROUGHT THE K WORD INTO THIS COUNCIL. YOU BROUGHT IT THE JEWISH K WORD INTO THE COUNCIL. ONLY YOU DID THAT.
00:44:17.188: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER COMMUNICATION FROM COUNCIL? WE HAVE BEFORE US THE CONSENT AGENDA. MAY I HAVE A MOTION TO APPROVE THE CONSENT AGENDA. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD, SECONDED BY LUMM. DISCUSSION OF THE CONSENT AGENDA. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
00:44:34.739: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  IF I COULD PULL A COUPLE OF THINGS. I WOULD LIKE TO PULL OUT CA-1 AND CA-11.
00:45:04.135: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
00:45:05.069: >> Councilmember Lumm: WE HAVE SEVERAL IMPORTANT ITEMS ON THE CONSENT AGENDA TONIGHT. AND I THINK WE SHOULD DISCUSS THEM PUBLICLY. I WOULD LIKE TO PULL OUT ALSO CA-6, CA-7, CA-17, CA-18 AND CA-20.
00:45:25.856: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE CONSENT AGENDA. COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
00:45:30.227: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WOULD LIKE TO PULL CA-19.
00:45:35.432: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE CONSENT AGENDA. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
00:45:38.269: >> Councilmember Hayner:  JUST DISCUSSION. 12, 13, 14, AND 15, ARE ALL RELATED TO THE MENTAL HEALTH COURT AND THE OTHER FACILITIES HERE IN THE COMMUNITY THAT WE SUPPORT THESE SOCIAL GOODS IN OUR COMMUNITY AND I WISH THEY WERE NOT EIGHT VOTES OUT OF THE BUDGET CYCLE. THEY SHOULD BE IN THE BUDGET CYCLE. I ESPECIALLY ENCOURAGE MY COLLEAGUES TO SUPPORT CA-15, WHICH IS A SAFE HOUSE AND YOU THEY DO A REMARKABLE GOOD WORK OUT THERE WITH REMARKABLY SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY FROM A CITY AND SO I'M -- IT'S SORT OF A COUNTY -- SORT OF COUNTY-BASED THING, IT'S NOT ACTUALLY IN THE CITY PROPERTY. I THINK THEY DO AN AMAZING JOB OUT THERE AND I REALLY ENCOURAGE US TO SUPPORT SAFE HOUSE NOW AND IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU.
00:46:22.847: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE CONSENT AGENDA. ALL IN FAVOR OF THE CONSENT AGENDA WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CA-1, 6, 11, 17, 18, 19, AND 20, ALL SAY AYE. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? THE CONCEPT AGENDA WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CA-1, 6, 11, 17, 18, 19, AND 20 ARE APPROVED. THAT SATISFIES THE 8 WITH CA-12, CA-13, CA-15, AND CA-14. THANK YOU. CA-1. RESOLUTION TO APPROVE NOVEMBER 21, 2019, RECOMMENDATION OF THE BOARD OF INSURANCE ADMINISTRATION. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI. SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER. DISCUSSION OF CA-1, COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
00:47:15.799: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. I'M JUST REPRESENTING MY CONSTITUENT HERE AND I APPRECIATE STAFF'S TIME AND EFFORT IN GETTING DOCUMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN REQUESTED REGARDING THIS CLAIM. MY CONCERN WAS THAT IT'S JUST REPORTED TO ME THAT SOME OF THE INFORMATION THAT WAS RELEASED LATER TO ME AND THEN GIVEN TO MY CONSTITUENT WAS NOT A PART OF THE INITIAL REVIEW OF THE CLAIM. AND I WAS JUST WONDERING IF THERE'S ANY LIGHT THAT CAN BE GIVEN AND I APOLOGIZE, PERHAPS FOR NOT PUTTING THIS IN THE AGENDA QUESTIONS. WITH THIS CLAIM, IF THERE'S ANY INFORMATION THAT CAN BE SHARED, IF NOT, I UNDERSTAND AT THIS POINT BUT I WANTED TO BRING IT UP. IT'S BEEN ASKED TO BE PULLED AND PERHAPPED DISCUSSED. AND, YOU KNOW, I JUST GOING BACK -- THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR SEVERAL MONTHS AND I NO WE NEED TO DENY THIS, OR APPROVE THIS FOR IT TO BE DENIED IN ORDER FOR THE APPEALS TO GO FORWARD, BUT WE ARE RUNNING AGAINST THE CLOCK. WITH THE WEATHER AND THE CONSTRUCTION AND THE REPAIRS THAT NEED TO BE DONE. AND I'M JUST WONDERING WHETHER THERE WAS ANYTHING THAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED IN A DIFFERENT WAY WHERE WE COULD HAVE HAD A RESOLUTION BROUGHT SOONER THAN CURRENTLY IS THE CASE.
00:48:42.519: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
00:48:43.520: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I SERVE ON THE BOARD OF INSURANCE WITH COUNCILMEMBER NELSON, AND I WILL JUST SHARE THAT THE BOARD OF INSURANCE HEARD TWO -- PROVIDED MR. HALLMAN THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE TECHNICALLY TWO APPEALS OF THIS MATTER. WE DISCUSSED IT AT LENGTH. AND MR. PETTIGREW, THE CITY TREASURER, WHO PRESIDES OVER THESE DELIBERATIONS IS NOT HERE THIS EVENING. I APOLOGIZE. I DIDN'T KNOW THIS WOULD BE REMOVED FROM THE AGENDA. I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THAT. I WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU -- SO THAT THE INFORMATION CAN BE PROVIDED YOU, THE ADDITIONAL BACKGROUND INFORMATION OF THE REVIEWS THAT WENT INTO THIS RECOMMENDATION, AND IN ORDER FOR MR. PETTIGREW TO BE HERE, TO FIELD ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE AND OTHERS MAY HAVE, I WOULD LIKE TO SUGGEST THAT WE POSTPONE THIS TO THE NEXT COUNCIL MEETING.
00:49:48.852: >> Mayor Taylor: MAY I HAVE A SECOND? SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER SMITH. DISCUSSION OF THE POSTPONEMENT? COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
00:49:55.959: >> Councilmember Bannister: WELL, AND I JUST WANTED TO WEIGH IN AND PERHAPS ASK JOHN FORNIER FOR FURTHER EXPLANATION. WE HAVE HAD AT LEAST ONE OTHER SITUATION THAT I KNOW OF, WHERE A CONTRACTOR WASHES THEIR CONCRETE DEBRIS INTO THE STORM DRAIN THAT SUBSEQUENTLY CAUSES A SEWER BACKUP AND OVERFLOW.
00:50:19.016: >> Councilmember Lumm: TO THAT, I WILL SAY THAT WE DID DISCUSS THAT ASPECT OF THIS CLAIM AND THERE WAS NO RELATED CAUSE AND EFFECT WITH WHAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED AND -- AND THIS BACKUP THAT HAPPENED. MR. PETTIGREW CAN PROVIDE YOU MORE INFORMATION. I THINK POSTPONING IT WOULD BE HELPFUL, BUT WE DID -- THIS WAS DISCUSSED, ADDRESSED, INVESTIGATED BY THE CITY STAFF, AND SO THERE'S MORE INFORMATION THAT WE COULD PROVIDE YOU TO HELP CLARIFY THIS RECOMMENDATION.
00:51:02.793: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER TO THE POSTPONEMENT.
00:51:04.995: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES. I WILL SUPPORT A POSTPOPEMENT BECAUSE I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN SEEING THAT INFORMATION. MY QUESTION ABOUT THE POSTPONEMENT IS, DOES POSTPONING THIS FOR TWO WEEKS IN ANY WAY AFFECT ANY KIND OF TIME LINE FOR APPEAL OR ANY OTHER SUCH MATTERS.
00:51:18.742: >> Councilmember Lumm: HE'S ALREADY HAD TWO APPEALS.
00:51:21.211: >> Councilmember Hayner:  IS THERE APPEAL OVER THE CITY OR IS IT SOLELY WITH THE CITY?
00:51:29.620: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. POSTEMA?
00:51:30.254: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I DON'T HAVE ALL THE BACKGROUND.
00:51:33.724: >> Coun.SOLELY A CITY CLAIM. [ OFF MICROPHONE COMMENTS ]
00:51:51.808: >> Councilmember Hayner: WELL, I WILL SUPPORT A DELAY.
00:51:55.879: >> Mayor Taylor: ALL IN FAVOR OF THE POSTPONEMENT? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT'S POSTPONED TO OUR NEXT MEETING. CA-11 RESOLUTION TO APPROVE THE PURCHASE OF A VEHICLE FROM LaFONTAINE CHRYSLER DODGE, MICHIGAN BID IN AMOUNT OF $39,772. MOVED BY RAMLAWI, SECONDED BY SMITH. DISCUSSION OF CA-11, COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
00:52:19.870: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. I WILL BE PULLING THESE TYPE OF CONSENT AGENDA SPENDING REQUESTS WHEN THEY PERTAIN TO THE MENTAL HEALTH COUNTY MILLAGE. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT CONTINUES TO BOTHER ME. IT WILL CONTINUE TO BOTHER ME UNTIL WE ADDRESS IT. IN THIS CASE, WE ARE GOING TO BE USING $21,000 OF THE COUNTY HEALTH MILLAGE TO PAY FOR SOMETHING THAT OUGHT TO BE PAID FOR WITH THE FLEET'S FUNDS. EVEN THOUGH WE ARE UPGRADING AND REPLACING ALL OF OUR VEHICLES TO MEET THE CLIMATE ACTION GOALS, THOSE COSTS NEED TO BE REALIZED BY THE ACTUAL DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE INCURRING THOSE COSTS AND QUIT, IN MY OPINION, ABUSING THE COUNTY HEALTH MILLAGE TO PAY FOR, IN THIS CASE, A CAR AND A CHARGING STATION THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE PAID FOR WITH A REGULAR OPERATING REVENUE AND EXPENSES AND IN THIS CASE IT WOULD BE PAID FOR BY THE FLEET FUND COMPLETELY. SO I'M GOING TO KEEP CALLING THIS OUT. I'M GOING TO KEEP URGING MY COLLEAGUES TO JOIN ME AND TO TURN THIS THING AROUND SO WE CAN SPEND THAT MONEY IN WAYS IT WAS BETTER INTENDED TO BE SPENT.
00:53:41.485: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. ROLL CALL VOTE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER SMITH. I'M SORRY. JEFF?
00:53:48.458: >> Councilmember Hayner: THAT'S OKAY. I WILL TALK TO YOU LATER, COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI. I AGREE.
00:53:55.165: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER SMITH.
00:54:05.709: >> Councilmember Smith: YES.
00:54:06.310: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  NO.
00:54:07.244: >> Councilmember Hayner:  NO.
00:54:08.245: >> Councilmember Bannister: NO.
00:54:11.114: >> Councilmember Griswold: NO.
00:54:15.285: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES.
00:54:15.886: >> Councilmember Grand: YES.
00:54:16.486: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES.
00:54:19.489: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
00:54:19.990: >> Councilmember Eaton: NO.
00:54:20.590: >> Councilmember Nelson:  YES.
00:54:22.326: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION CARRIES.
00:54:30.667: >> Mayor Taylor: C.A.LY 6, RESOLUTION TO APPROVE A GRANT APPLICATION TO THE USDA AGRICULTURAL CONSEVENNATION EASEMENT PROGRAM. MOVED BY LUMM AND GRAND. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
00:54:43.380: >> Councilmember Lumm: THIS IS TO APPLY FOR A GRANT FOR CONSERVATION EASEMENT IN SALEM TOWNSHIP. IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S 375 ACRES WHICH WOULD REPRESENT THE LARGEST GREEN BELT TRANSACTION WE EVER HAD. THE PRICE TAG WILL BE A BIG ONE IN THE $3.5 MILLION RANGE, WHICH MAKES IT ALL THE MORE CRITICAL THAT CITY TAXPAYER GREEN BELT DOLLARS ARE VERY WELL LEVERAGED. THE FIRST STEP IN LEVERAGING IT TRYING TO SECURE A FEDERAL GRANT, AND THAT'S WHAT THIS RESOLUTION DOES. SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING IT. A FEDERAL GRANT ALONE WILL NOT PROVIDE THE NECESSARY LEVERAGE, I BELIEVE ANN ARBOR TAXPAYERS DESERVE. SO IT WILL BE VERY IMPORTANT TO ALSO SECURE FUNDING FROM THE COUNTY, FROM SALEM COMPANY AND PERHAPS OTHERS. THE COVER MEMO INDICATES A CITY QUOTE WILL SEEK FUNDING CONTRIBUTIONS FROM WASHTENAW COUNTY BEING SALEM TOWNSHIP, LOCAL LAND CONSERVATION ENTITIES AND OTHER RELEVANT STAKEHOLDERS, END QUOTE. THAT IS CERTAINLY APPROPRIATE AND HOPEFULLY THERE WILL BE SEVERAL OTHER CONTRIBUTORS AND THE CONTRIBUTIONS WILL BE SUBSTANTIAL. IF NOT, I WILL LIKELY NOT SUPPORT THE CONSERVATION PURCHASE EASEMENT WHEN IT COMES BACK TO COUNCIL WHICH IS EXPECTED IN SEPTEMBER. IT'S NOT JUST THE MAGNITUDE THAT MAKES THIS PURCHASE UNIQUE, HOWEVER. A PORTION OF THIS PROPERTY, 80 ACRES OR ABOUT 20% LIES OUTSIDE THE GREEN BELT BOUNDARY. AND THAT'S VERY CONCERNING TO ME. PURCHASING PROPERTY OUTSIDE THE BOUNDARIES IS A SLIPPERY SLOPE, ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING WE HAVE ALREADY EXPANDED THE BOUNDARY TWICE IN 2007 AND IN 2011. BEYOND WHAT WAS ORIGINALLY APPROVED BY VOTERS BACK IN 2003. AT SOME POINT AS WE MOVE FURTHER AND FURTHER AWAY FROM ANN ARBOR, THERE ARE DIMINISHING RETURNS FOR FOLKS PAYING THE BILLS, ANN ARBOR TAXPAYERS. DIFFERENT PEOPLE WILL HAVE DIFFERENT VIEWS ON WHETHER WE HIT THAT POINT ALREADY. COUNCIL NEEDS TO CAREFULLY CONSIDER HOW FAR FROM THE CITY LIMITS WE WILL GO TO PROTECT PROPERTY. SO WITH THIS ONE, THERE'S STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS BEYOND JUST THE BASIC OBLIGATION TO LEVERAGE ANN ARBOR TAX DOLLARS. WE WILL BE HAVING CONVERSATIONS SOON ABOUT THE GREEN BELT STRATEGIC PLAN AND THAT'S APPROPRIATE. IN THE MEANTIME, I WILL SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION TONIGHT TO APPLY FOR FEDERAL GRANT FUNDS, BECAUSE THAT'S THE NECESSARY FIRST STEP. THANK YOU.
00:57:07.691: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER COMMUNICATION -- PARDON ME. FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. CA-7, RESOLUTION TO ACCEPT THE REVISED SOLID WASTE RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PLAN. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN. DISCUSSION BY CA-7, COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
00:57:30.313: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU AGAIN MR. MAYOR. THIS SOLID WASTE RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PLAN IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT STUDIES WE HAVE UNDERTAKEN. IT WAS VERY WELL-DONE. COMPREHENSIVE, AND OBJECTIVE. AND THE RECOMMENDATION IS WELL THOUGHT OUT AND DATA DRIVEN. MY THANKS AGAIN TO CITY STAFF, AND TO ACTUM. AS EVIDENCED BY THE STUDY ITSELF AND THE POTENTIAL COST SAVINGS IDENTIFIED, IT'S CLEAR THAT THE PROCESSES THAT WE HAVE NOW FOR SOLID WASTE, RECYCLING AND COMPOSTING ARE NOT EFFICIENT OR PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE. FOR WHATEVER REASONS, WE HAVE EVOLVED TO A POINT WHERE WE HAVE AI HODGEPODGE OF SERVICE PROVIDERS DOING DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF COLLECTION AND FOR ME, THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT TAKE AWAY FROM THE STUDDIE IS THAT THERE ARE SUBSTANTIAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR COST SAVING TO TAXPAYERS THROUGH COLLECTION CONSOLIDATION. IT'S NEVER PLEASANT TO DISCOVER THAT WHAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING IS NOT PARTICULARLY EFFICIENT, BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS THE POTENTIAL CONSOLIDATION SAVINGS ARE REALLY SIGNIFICANT. OVER $2 MILLION A YEAR, AND THOSE SAVINGS CAN FUND THE NEW SERVICES WE WOULD LIKE, LIKE YEAR ROUND COMPOSTING AND IMPROVEMENTS NECESSARY, LIKE WEEKEND SERVICE DOWNTOWN. I FULLY SUPPORT THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE PLAN AND ENTHUSIASTICALLY SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION TONIGHT. IT'S NOT OFTEN WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE ACTIONS THAT CAN RESULT IN SUCH FINANCIAL BENEFITS TO OUR -- FOR OUR TAXPAYERS. AGAIN THE STUDY IDENTIFIES POTENTIAL TAX DOLLARS OF $2 MILLION ANNUALLY. $1.3 MILLION FROM COMMERCIAL COLLECTION ACTIVITIES AND $775,000 FROM CONSOLIDATION OF RESIDENTIAL COLLECTION SERVICES. OBVIOUSLY, WE NEED TO GO THROUGH THE COMPETITIVE BIDDING PROCESSES BEFORE WE KNOW WHAT THE ACTUAL SAVINGS WILL BE, BUT THE POTENTIAL IS HUGE! I JUST HOPE THAT WHEN DECISION TIME COMES, THE CITY WILL BE PERSUADED BY THE FINANCIALS AND THE SERVICE QUALITY RATHER THAN BY A BLIND ALLEGIANCE TO A PARTICULAR VENDOR. IF HISTORY IS ANY INDICATION, HOWEVER, COUNCIL WILL CHOOSE BUSINESS TO SOURCE BUSINESS TO RECYCLE ANN ARBOR. REGARDLESS OF COST OR QUALITY CONSIDERATIONS. WE LIKE THEM. THEY ARE OUR FRIENDS. ANYWAY, WE WILL HAVE TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS BUT WE DO APPEAR TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE SERVICE QUALITY OVERALL AND SAVE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS BY IMPLEMENTING THIS SOLID WASTE RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PLAN, AND THAT'S EXCITING. THANK YOU.
01:00:02.732: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
01:00:07.871: >> Councilmember Eaton: THIS IS ONE OF THOSE RARE OCCASIONS WHERE I DISAGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE COUNCILMEMBER LUMM. I BELIEVE THAT THIS SOLID WASTE PLAN IS LACKING IN FUNDAMENTAL WAYS. I'M DISAPPOINTED THAT WE SPENT THE AMOUNT OF MONEY AND THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT WE DID ON THIS PLAN AND CAME UP WITH A DOCUMENT THAT REALLY SPECULATES AS TO SAVINGS, AS OPPOSED TO IDENTIFYING REAL AND IDENTIFIABLE SAVINGS. I'M ESPECIALLY DISTURBED THAT WE HAVE A FIVE-YEAR PLAN IN FRONT OF US, THAT REALLY DOESN'T MAKE ANY RECOMMENDATIONS AS TO HOW WE GET TO OUR -- OR PROCEED TOWARDS ZERO WASTE, WHICH HAS BEEN A LONG-TERM GOAL OF OURS, AND YET WE ARE NOT EVEN DISCUSSING IT AT THIS POINT IN TIME. INSTEAD THIS PLAN PARSES OUT SMALL PARTICULAR ACTIVITIES SUCH AS FIXING THE LONG-TERM DOWNTOWN TRASH COLLECTION PICKUP PROBLEMS, AND RATHER THAN BEING A PLANNING DOCUMENT, IT'S REALLY JUST A LIST OF TO DO ITEMS THAT WE CAN DO WITHOUT A PLAN, ACTUALLY. WE COULD HAVE SOLVES OUR MRF PROBLEM SOMETIME AGO. AND THIS FALLS SHORT IN A VARIETY OF WAYS. THIS MORNING WE RECEIVED A MEMORANDUM -- A JOINT AIRPORT FROM THE HURON VALLEY OF THE SIERRA CLUB AND THE HURON VALLEY AREA LABOR FEDERATION, THE ECOLOGY CENTER, AND ANN ARBOR AREA ELDERS FOR CLIMATE ACTION, AND A RETIRED SOLID WASTE EMPLOYEE FROM THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. MAKING SOME RECOMMENDATIONS AND I BELIEVE THESE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE PERTINENT. AND I WOULD LIKE TO RECOMMEND THAT WE REFER THIS PLAN BACK TO COUNCIL -- I MEAN BACK TO STAFF TO ACTUALLY ADDRESS THE ISSUES RAISED IN THAT MEMORANDUM AND SEEK AN IMPROVED PLAN. IF WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A FIVE-YEAR PLAN, IT SHOULD ACTUALLY HAVE SOME GREATER VISION WITHIN ITS RECOMMENDATIONS. SO I'M MOVING TO --
01:02:39.422: >> Mayor Taylor: PERHAPS CAN I SUGGEST THAT THAT BE A MOTION TO TABLE, AND THAT STAFF TAKE THAT RECOMMENDATION?
01:02:48.898: >> Councilmember Eaton: OKAY. I HAVE NO OBJECTION TO TABLING IT.
01:02:51.401: >> Mayor Taylor: ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU S. THERE A SECOND? SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER SMITH.
01:02:56.739: >> Councilmember Smith: DISCUSS? [ OFF MICROPHONE COMMENT ]
01:03:04.581: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM? COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN. ZACK >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK STAFF FOR LOOKING AT THIS THIS IS DATA THAT WE HAVE NOT LOOKED AT COMPREHENSIVELY IN MY TIME HERE, AND DONE SO IN A PROFESSIONAL MANNER. I THINK THERE IS STILL SOME HEARTBURN FOR MEMBERS OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND LABOR COMMUNITIES THAT WE WOULD LOVE TO WORK THROUGH WITH YOU. BUT I WANT TO EXTEND THANKS BEFORE THIS VOTE.
01:03:34.110: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
01:03:37.313: >> Councilmember Hayner: WELL, I THINK THAT SETTING THIS ASIDE MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE IF WE UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE TO KIND OF HUSTLE ON THE BACK SIDE HERE TO LET STAFF KNOW WHAT IT IS THAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR. I AGREE WITH COUNCILMEMBER EATON'S CONCERNS ABOUT THE SOLID WASTE PLAN, SOMEWHAT NEGLECTING ZERO WASTE OR PASSING OFF ZERO WASTE BACK TO THE SOLID WASTE RESOURCES PLAN, BUT OUR CITY SOLID WASTE RESOURCES PLAN SAYS THAT WE SEEK TO MAXIMIZE, COMPOSTING OVER THE AMOUNT OF LANDFILL. THAT'S NOT ZERO WASTE. IT MEANS IT DISAPPEARS FROM YOUR CURB AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE IT GOES. ZERO WASTE IS YOU DON'T GENERATE ANY WASTE OR YOU GENERATE AS LITTLE WASTE AS POSSIBLE AND THEN IT'S DEALT WITH IN AN ECOLOGICALLY APPROPRIATE MANNER. I DON'T SEE THAT SPELLED OUT HERE AND I'M HAPPY TO TABLE IT AND SEND IT BACK FOR REVIEW. I'M NOT BEHOLDEN TO ANY SPECIAL INTEREST. I DON'T HAVE ANY PREDISPOSITION AS TO WHO SHOULD BE TAKING OUR TRASH AND RECYCLING IT. I WANT THE BEST DEAL FOR COMMUNITY AND THE ENVIRONMENT AND KEEPING WITH OUR CLIMATE ACTION GOALS. SO I WILL HAPPILY SUPPORT TABLING THIS, AS LONG AS MY COLLEAGUES UNDERSTAND THAT TABLING IT SENDS IT OFF INTO A NETHERLAND. WE NEED TO LET STAFF KNOW WHAT IT IS THAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR. THANK YOU.
01:04:55.959: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. COUNCILMEMBER SMITH AND RAMLAWI.
01:04:59.162: >> Councilmember Smith: I WOULD ADD THE BIG THING THAT CHANGED FROM THE POINT WHERE -- THE INITIAL DRAFT WAS DEVELOPED AND NOW IS THE FACT THAT WE -- WE HAVE GOT OUR C CARBON NEUTRALITY COMMITMENT THAT IMPACTS THIS DOCUMENT AND NEEDS TO BE REVISED. I THINK WHEN WE -- WHEN THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION VOTED TO RECOMMEND THAT THIS BODY APPROVE THE PLAN, YOU KNOW, WE ALL RECOGNIZED THAT THIS IS LIGHT ON THE LANGUAGE THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE REGARDING ZERO WASTE AND CARBON NEUTRALITY, BUT IT ALSO MOVES THE BALL FORWARD FOR THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN PROBLEMATIC FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS, NOTABLY YEAR ROUND ORGANICS COLLECTION AND THE RESOLUTION THAT WE PASSED TO REOPEN THE MURF WAS REALLY THE PRIMARY FOCUS OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION. I THINK BEING ABLE TO OF MONTH THOSE TWO THINGS FORWARD IS IMPORTANT AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION CERTAINLY WANTS THOSE THINGS TO HAPPEN. I THINK IT'S WORTH TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION SOME OF THE INFORMATION THAT THE SIERRA CLUB MEMO RAISES. I THINK, YOU KNOW, ADDRESSING SOME OF THE CARBON NEUTRALITY ISSUES THAT ARE NOW REQUIRED, I THINK, IS A USEFUL THING TO DO. AND I KNOW THAT ONE OF THE STICKING POINTS FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION WAS IN METRIC TOWER. HOW ARE WE TRACKING ALL OF THIS INFORMATION? HOW ARE WE GOING TO DETERMINE WHAT'S SUCCESSFUL AND HOW DO WE DO THAT? AND ONE THING THIS REPORT WAS QUITE LIGHT ON WAS ON RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WAY AND I KNOW THAT THERE'S A SUBCOMMITTEE WORKING ON DEVELOPING SOME TARGET PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
01:06:54.644: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:06:55.545: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, MAYOR. AND THANKS TO STAFF FOR PUTTING THIS TOGETHER. THERE'S BEEN A LOT TO WRANGLE AND PUT INTO A DOCUMENT. THIS CAME TO US IN ITS COMPLETE FORMAT. A LOT TO LOOK AT, A LOT OF DETAILS. WE ARE POLICYMAKERS. SO, YOU KNOW, I FEEL THAT THAT'S WHERE I NEED TO STAY, BUT THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS IN THIS PLAN THAT I THINK NEED ADDRESSING AND I'M GLAD IT'S BEING TABLED. I WAS HOPING IT WOULD BE POSTPONED AT LEAST UNTIL OUR FULL-TIME CITY ADMINISTRATOR WAS HERE TO ANSWER SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WE HAVE. I DON'T REALLY -- I'M NOT REALLY SWAYED VERY STRONGLY ABOUT THE SAVINGS THAT ARE PROJECTED TO HAPPEN UNDER THIS. PLAN. THERE'S WAY TOO MANY VARIABLES AND THAT WON'T MOVE ME VERY MUCH. I WANT TO SEE CERTAIN POLICIES IMPLEMENTED. WE ARE ONLY LOOKING AT 5 TO 10% REDUCTION IN OUR WASTE, WHICH IS WOEFULLY TOO LOW. WE ARE PUTTING, YOU KNOW, THESE CLIMATE ACTION GOALS AND MEASURES ON THE SHOULDERS OF BENEVOLENT BUSINESS OWNERS: BUSINESS OWNERS THAT WANT TO PAY MORE TO HAVE THEIR ORGANICS TAKEN. THAT'S NOT REALLY GOING TO GET US TO THE LEVEL THAT WE NEED TO BE AT. WE NEED TO BE DOING MORE. WE NEED -- THERE IS A GREATER GOOD THAT NEEDS TO BE APPLIED HERE, AND PAID FOR. THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WE ARE GOING TO JUST PUT ON INDIVIDUAL BUSINESSES IN THE DOWNTOWN AREA, AND SAY, WELL, IF YOU PAY AN EXTRA $4,000 OR $5,000 A YEAR, YOU CAN GO TO BED WITH A CLEAR CONSCIENCE. THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR. I'M LOOKING FOR ALL THE ORGANICS TO BE PICKED UP, REGARDLESS IF THE SMALL BUSINESS OWNER IS GOING TO PAY MORE OR NOT. WE ARE NOT LOOKING AT THAT. WE ARE LOOKING AT MORE RED TAPE, WHEN WE LOOK AT FATS, OIL AND GREASE. THE F.O.G. THESE THINGS, I DON'T THINK ARE VERY PRAGMATIC IN ACHIEVING THE GOALS THAT WE SET OUT, AND I'M NOT GOING TO BE SWAYED BY THE FACTS -- WELL, I WILL BE SWAYED BY THE FACTS, BUT THE FIGURES BEING PUT IN HERE. I DON'T THINK IT'S WORTH IT. I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE THESE OTHER ISSUES THAT I OUTLINED ADDRESSED, AND WORRY ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO PAY FOR IT. THERE IS ROOM UNDER OUR MILLAGE TO INCREASE OUR FEES BUT I REALLY DON'T LIKE SOME OF THE DETAILS IN HERE AND I CAN TALK OFFLINE WITH THAT, BUT THERE'S -- IT'S A GOOD STARTING STARTINGPOINT BUT, THERE'S A LOT STILL NEEDS TO BE DONE WITH IT.
01:09:57.360: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE TABLING. MR. FORNIER?
01:10:01.197: >> THANK YOU ALL. I JUST WANT TO LET EVERYBODY KNOW THAT I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS THAT ARE THANKFUL TO STAFF FOR THE WORK THEY PUT IN OON THIS PLAN. IF IT'S THE DESIRE OF THE COUNCIL TO DELAY THIS MOTION FOR SOME TIME, STAFF WILL CERTAINLY COMPLY AND WE WILL LOOK FORWARD TO A CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW THE PLAN -- YOU KNOW, HOW WE CAN MOVE FORWARD WITH THE PLAN. I WANT TO JUST REITERATE THE EXCELLENT WORK THAT CITY STAFF HAS DONE ON THIS PLAN. I KNOW EILEEN, CR, CRAIG, MOLLYD OTHERS HAVE WORKED OPEN THIS AND POURED THEIR HEART AND SOUL ON THIS. WE RETAINED AN EXCELLENT CONSULTANT WITH AN EXCELLENT REPRESENTATION WHO HAS A VERY GOOD PRODUCT. SO GIVEN THE COST AND THE TIME THAT HAS BEEN EXPENDED ON THIS, I WOULD LIKE US ALL TO KEEP IN MIND THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO MOVE FORWARD WITH A SOLID WASTE RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PLAN AND MAKE SURE THAT WE GET VALUE OUT OF THE PROCESS AND THE EFFORT THAT WE HAVE PUT INTO THIS THUS FAR. SO, AGAIN, APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO COUNCIL'S DIRECTION ON THIS ISSUE.
01:11:09.465: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
01:11:10.766: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU, MAYOR TAYLOR, AND MR. FORNIER. IN ALL OF MY YEARS, UNEQUIVOCALLY, THIS IS THE MOST THOROUGH, WELL-RESEARCHED, DATA-DRIVEN REPORT I HAVE EVER SEEN THE CITY PRODUCE. IT IS EXCEPTIONAL. AND LOTS OF QUESTION WERE ASKED AND YOU CAN GO TO THE COUNCIL Q&A. IT'S ATTACHED AS A LEG ISTAR ITEM. WE HAVE 77 PAGES IN RESPONSE MATERIAL TONIGHT. BECAUSE OF THE HOLIDAY, WE GOT IT THIS EVENING. THANK YOU, STAFF. MOST OF THEM, THERE WERE ATTACHMENTS RELATED TO WHAT WE HAVE. WE HAVE A BOAT LOAD AND THAT'S A GROSS UNDERSTATEMENT. AGAIN, I CANNOT COMMEND STAFF ENOUGH. AND ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I DID ASK AND MAYBE MR. HUPY, I SEE YOU OVER IN THE CORNER. AMONG OTHER THINGS, THERE ARE 24 INTERTWINED RECOMMENDATIONS THAT STAFF, YOU KNOW, WE NEED TO MOVE ON. AND ONE OF THE ISSUES HAS TO DO WITH THE -- WITH COMPETITIVE BIDDING OF THE SERVICE AND I'M LOOKING FOR THAT PARTICULAR QUESTION, WHICH I DID ASK ABOUT. AND WE WERE TO UNDERTAKE THAT RELATIVELY SOON. DO YOU WANT TO SPEAK TO THAT MR. HUPY? WHEN WE TALK ABOUT TABLING, WE CAN'T LOSE SIGHT OF THIS. I THINK YOU -- THE PROCUREMENT DOCUMENTS WILL BE ISSUED BY THE END OF JANUARY 2020.
01:12:54.637: >> THAT'S THE CURRENT TIMETABLE THAT WAS PREDICATED ON IT
01:13:01.710: >> Councilmember Lumm: APPROVING
01:13:03.179: >> WE CAN ADJUST THAT AS THE PLAN LOOKED AT. THAT IS OUR TIMETABLE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE PROCUREMENTS GOING OUT THE END OF THE JANUARY FOR BIDDING. UNDERSTANDING THAT WE HAVE THE END OF JUNE THAT THE CURRENT CONTRACTS EXPIRE, EVEN GIVEN THAT WITH THE PROCUREMENT OF TRUCKS FOR WHOEVER WOULD RECEIVE -- BE THE -- THE PROPOSER THAT WOULD RECEIVE THE CONTRACT. IT'S LIKELY THAT WE WILL HAVE TO DO SOME EXTENSION OF EXISTING CONTRACTS BECAUSE THE LEAD TIME ON TRUCKS IS NEARLY A YEAR. SO, YES, WE ARE AWARE OF THE TIME CONSTRAINTS.
01:13:49.625: >> Councilmember Lumm: AND MR. SLAUGHTON, I WANT TO CALL YOU OUT FOR YOUR MANY YEARS OUTSTANDING SERVICE TO OUR CITY AND YOU ARE THE LEAD ON --
01:13:57.132: >> YES, HE IS THE LEAD ON THIS.
01:14:00.135: >> Councilmember Lumm: AND YOU ARE HERE FOR ANOTHER WEEK, I BELIEVE.
01:14:02.605: >> THREE.
01:14:02.905: >> Councilmember Lumm: THREE WEEKS. OKAY. SO COLLEAGUES, THAT'S ALSO SOMETHING TO KEEP --
01:14:07.543: >> I WILL TAKE THAT LEAD TO INTRODUCE ELAINE NAPLES, OUR RESOURCE RECOVERY MANAGER, WHO HAS BEEN HIRED TO STEP IN THE SHOES BEHIND --
01:14:18.587: >> Councilmember Lumm: BIG SHOES TO FILL. YES. SO THANK YOU ALL. SO I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING TABLING. AGAIN, I -- YOU KNOW, WE HAVE GOT COMPREHENSIVE SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE SOUND, LOGICAL, AND ONE OF THE THINGS I TRULY LOVE ABOUT THIS IS THAT THE BASIC APPROACH THAT'S BEING TAKEN HERE IS TO GENERATE SAVINGS FOR DESIRED NEW SERVICES AND TO TAKE THAT APPROACH RATHER THAN JUST RAISE THE COST OF TAXPAYERS, YOU KNOW, TO OVERRIDE -- DO A HEADLEY OVERFROM THE SOLID WASTE MILLAGE. I THINK OUR TAXPAYERS PAY PLENTY. TO GENERATE SAVINGS THE WAY THIS PROPOSAL DOES, TO SAVE THAT COST, THE ADDED COST FOR THE TAXPAYERS IS HUGE. AND I ALSO HOPE THAT, YOU KNOW -- THAT THE WHOLE COMPETITIVE SOLICITATION EFFORT IS NOT A WASTE OF TIME. YOU KNOW, I'M SKEPTICAL THAT WE WILL RESOURCE BUSINESS AWAY FROM RECYCLE ANN ARBOR AND THIS COMPETITIVE SOLICITATION WILL BE A WASTE OF TIME. I SURE AS HECK HOPE NOT. WE OWE THAT TO OUR TAXPAYERS FOX ONE HAS A GOD-GIVEN RIGHT TO DO ANYTHING. WE H OWE HAD TO COMPETITIVELY B. IT'S THEIR MONEY AND WE HAVE TO TREAT IT THAT WAY AND VIEW IT THAT WAY.
01:15:55.951: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
01:15:57.219: >> Councilmember Hayner:  IF WE VOTE THIS DOWN, THEN WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASK QUESTIONS OF THE STAFF HERE IN THE ROOM?
01:16:03.559: >> Mayor Taylor: CORRECT. FURTHER DISCUSSION? I WOULD LIKE TO -- I WILL SUPPORT THE TABLING AND I ALSO WANT TO ECHO MY THANKS TO REALLY, CERTAINLY TO STAFF AND THE CONSULTANTS FOR THE HARD AND DETAILED WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE HERE. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION. THEY HAVE BEEN LONG ENGAGED IN THIS PROCESS AS WELL AND, OF COURSE, TO THE SEVERAL COMMUNITY GROUPS WHO HAVE T FOCUSED ON THS IMPORTANT PART OF -- WELL, IT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE MUNICIPAL SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE EVERY DAY. IT'S THE METHED ODD IN WHICH WE PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES. IT'S THE SERVICES THAT ARE DELIVERED. IT IS THE COSTS FOR THOSE SERVICES, AND THE ECONOMIC AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF THOSE SERVICES. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE WORK THAT WE DO AS A CITY. IT IS, I BELIEVE, IMPORTANT THAT -- THAT WE GET IT RIGHT AND THAT WE DO IT IN A MANNER THAT ACHIEVES THE BROADEST BASED POSSIBLE SUPPORT AND I LOOK FORWARD TO HELPING ACHIEVE THAT, BUILDING UPON THE BASE OF A DETAILED AND WELL-WORKED PLAN. FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
01:17:17.166: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YEAH, I JUST WANT TO SAY, I DON'T DIMINISH THE WORK THAT'S BEEN PUT IN HERE, AND I APPRECIATE COUNCILMEMBER LUMM'S EXPERIENCE ON THIS BODY TO KNOW THE QUALITY OF THIS REPORT AND I'M NOT HERE TO ADMONISH THAT OR TAKE ANYTHING AWAY FROM THAT. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME THINGS APPLIED TO THIS TO STRENGTHEN IT, AND HOPEFULLY IT DOES NOT JEOPARDIZE OUR POSITION WHEN IT COMES TO PROCURING SERVICES FOR OUR RESIDENTS. BUT I DON'T NECESSARILY BELIEVE THIS IS ALL DOLLARS AND CENTS. I THINK A LOT OF IT IS ABOUT SERVICE AND VALUE AND THE SURVEYS REPRESENT THAT. HAD .PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO PAY W EXTRA DOLLARS MORE SO THAT THE TRASH AND THE COMPOST IS HANDLED PROPERLY. I FEEL LIKE THE TAXPAYER WOULD BE WILLING TO PAY A LITTLE BIT MORE IN ORDER TO GET SERVICES -- INCREASED SERVICES THAT REPRESENT THE VALUES THE COMMUNITY.
01:18:33.142: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE TABLING. ROLL CALL VOTE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER SMITH.
01:18:42.284: >> Councilmember Smith: YES.
01:18:43.719: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES.
01:18:45.554: >> Councilmember Hayner:  NO.
01:18:46.155: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES.
01:18:47.856: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES.
01:18:51.326: >> Councilmember Lumm: NO.
01:18:51.894: >> Councilmember Grand: YES.
01:18:52.494: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES.
01:18:55.297: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
01:18:55.798: >> Councilmember Eaton: YES.
01:18:56.398: >> Councilmember Nelson:  YES. CLERK MOTION CARRIES.
01:19:03.338: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION CARRIES.
01:19:11.046: >> Mayor Taylor: DISCUSSION OF CA LIVE 17. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
01:19:15.517: >> Councilmember Lumm: THIS IS TO HAVE 100 NEW HOUSING VOUCHERS THE CITY HAS RECENTLY BASKETBALL AWARDED FROM H.U.D. RECEIVING THE ADDITIONAL 100 VOUCHERS TOTALING ABOUT $900,000 IS REALLY GOOD NEWS WORTH MENTIONING AND THE AWARD ALSO INCLUDES ABOUT $70,000 TO PAY FOR THE RELATED ADMINISTRATION COSTS. MY GENERAL RULE IS TO REJECT BUDGET AMENDMENTS DURING THE COURSE OF THE YEAR AND OUTSIDE OF THE REGULAR BUDGETING PROCESS. I BELIEVE STRONGLY THAT IT'S JUST NOT SOLID BUDGET DISCIPLINE OR FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE. WE DISCUSS THE DETAILS IN THE WORK SESSION AND THEN APPROVE THE BUDGET AFTER A LENGTH ROBUST PROCESS. APPROVING ONE OFF ACTIONS OUTSIDE THAT PROCESS IS NOT APPROPRIATE PROCESS. BUT OCCASIONALLY THERE ARE VALID EXCEPTIONS. WHEN YOU HAVE A SITUATION LIKE THIS ONE, WHERE A SPECIFIC EVENT OCCURS DURING THE YEAR THAT WAS NOT ANTICIPATED IN THE BUDGET. AND THAT EVENT DRIVES WORKLOAD. AND NOT MEETING THAT WORKLOAD HAS SPECIFIC ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES. AND IN MY VIEW IT IS APPROPRIATE TO ADJUST THE BUDGET. AND THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE HERE. THE VOUCHER AWARDS WE JUST RECEIVED WERE NOT EXPECTED WHEN THE BUDGET WAS APPROVED. THEY OBVIOUSLY DRIVE WORKLOAD. AND IF WE DON'T USE THE VOUCHERS, WE LOSE THEM GOING FORWARD. SO THERE ARE SPECIFIC ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES OF NOT ACTING. FOR ME, THIS IS A VALID EXCEPTION. PLUS, THE ADD ADD VOUCHERS ARE AUTOMATICALLY RENEWED ANNUALLY. SO THIS IS NOT THE CASE OF STAFFING UP FOR A ONE-TIME TEMPORARY WORKLOAD INCREASE WHICH IS NOT FISCALLY PRUDENT EITHER. AGAIN, IT'S EXCITING THAT WE RECEIVE THE SIGNIFICANT ADDED AWARD FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS RESOLUTION TONIGHT. THANK YOU.
01:21:07.462: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED WITH 11 COUNCILMEMBERS PRESENT, ALL VOTING IN THE AFFIRMATIVE, THUS SATISFYING THE 8 VOTE REQUIREMENT. CA-18, RESOLUTION DIRECTING THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR TO DEVELOP ORDINANCE AMENDMENTS FOR THE PURPOSE OF REGULATING SHORT-TERM RENTAL PROPERTIES. MOVED BY LUMM AND GRAND. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
01:21:32.287: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANKS. I'M SURE SEVERAL PEOPLE WANT TO SPEAK TO THIS. THANK YOU TO EVERYONE WHO HAS WRITTEN US ON THIS, AND COME TO SPEAK TO US TONIGHT. YOUR FEEDBACK AND INPUT HAS BEEN VERY HELPFUL. THIS ITEM, ESTABLISHING REGULATIONS ON SHORT-TERM RENTALS IN ANN ARBOR IS ANOTHER TOPIC THAT'S IMPORTANT TO OUR RESIDENTS, AND CLEARLY WORTH DISCUSSING. SHORT-TERM RENTALS OF PROPERTIES AIRBNB AND THE LIKE HAVE GROWN DRAMATICALLY IN ANN ARBOR. WHILE WE ALL UNDERSTAND THE BENEFITS TO TRAVELERS, WE MAY NOT FULLY APPRECIATE THE POTENTIAL NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES, INCLUDING INCREASED NUISANCES, ALTERING THE CHARACTER OF NEIGHBORHOODS AND REDUCING THE SUPPLY OF PERMANENT HOUSING. WE HAVE RECEIVED SEVERAL EMAILS FROM RESIDENTS SPEAKING TO THESE IMPORTANT ADVERSE IMPACTS ESPECIALLY FROM THE NONOWNER OCCUPIED SHORT-TERM RENTAL PROPERTIES. AND THANKS AGAIN TO ALL THE PEOPLE WHO WEIGHED. IN GIVEN THE POTENTIAL ADVERSE IMPACTS AND THE EXPLOSIVE GROWTH, THE DATA WE WERE PROVIDED INDICATED THERE WERE 1,400 SHORT-TERM RENTALS FROM JULY 2018 TO JUNE 2019 WITH 131 PROPERTIES RENTED FOR MORE THAN 150 DAYS DURING THE YEAR. AND THOSE NUMBERS ARE PROBABLY UNDERSTATED. IT CLEARLY MAKES SENSE TO CONSIDER SPECIFIC NEW REGULATIONS ON SHORT-TERM RENTALS. I SUPPORT THE APPROACH THE CITY HAS TAKEN HERE. FIRST COLLECTING DATA, LOOKING AT BENCHMARK CITIES, CONDUCTING PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT AND IDENTIFYING REGULATORY OPTIONS. AND THEN TONIGHT, PRESENTING A RESOLUTION FOR COUNCIL TO CONSIDER DIRECTING STAFF TO DEVELOP ORDINANCES BASED ON A SPECIFIC FRAMEWORK. WHILE STILL LEAVING ROOM FOR FLEXIBILITY, HAVING AN ESTABLISHED FRAMEWORK UP FRONT GIVES COUNCIL AND THE COMMUNITY A GOOD SENSE OF WHAT IS COMING WHEN THE SPECIFIC ORDINANCES ARE PRESENTED TO COUNCIL THIS SUMMER AND THAT'S VERY HELPFUL. THE FRAMEWORK CONTEMPLATED IS BASED ON OPTION THREE, OUTLINED IN THE CARLISLE WARTMAN REPORT. THAT OPTION THREE PROHIBITS NONOWNER OCCUPIED SHORT-TERM RENTALS ALL TOGETHER, AND WOULD ESTABLISH REGULATIONS FOR OWNER OCCUPIED PRIMARY RESIDENT SHORT-TERM RENTALS INCLUDING REGISTRATION AND LICENSING REQUIRED INSPECTIONS AND PAYING FEES. I BELIEVE THAT'S AN APPROPRIATE FRAMEWORK AND REASONABLE PLACE TO START. I WILL BE SUPPORTING CA-18 TONIGHT. PERSONALLY, I BELIEVE EVEN STRICTER REGULATIONS ARE APPROPRIATE, SUCH AS RESTRICTIONS ON SPACING, DISTANCE AND LOCATION AND LIMITING THE NUMBER OF RENTAL DAYS, AND I WAS ENCOURAGED BY STAFF'S RESPONSE TO MY QUESTION THAT THEY BELIEVE BANNING PRIMARY RESIDENTS, WHOLE HOUSE RENTALS WHEN THE OWNER IS NOT PRESENT SHOULD ALSO BE CONSIDERED. I AGREE WITH THAT. BUT AS I SAID, THIS IS A REASONABLE PLACE TO START AND COUNCIL WILL HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO AMEND THE ORDINANCE PROPOSALS WHEN THEY COME TO US. I ALSO THINK THESE REGULATIONS MAY PROMPT SOME OWNERS TO TRY AND FIND WAYS AROUND THEM. SO WHEN THE ORDINANCES COME TO COUNCIL, THE PLAN FOR MONITORING AND ENFORCEMENT AND TO CLOSE ANY LOOPHOLES WILL BE CRITICAL AND LIKELY REQUIRE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. ANYWAY THANKS AGAIN TO STAFF FOR STRUCTURING A SOLID APPROACH TO ADDRESSING THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE, AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THE ORDINANCE RECOMMENDATIONS LATER THIS YEAR. THANK YOU.
01:24:52.420: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF CA-18. COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
01:24:59.094: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I VIEW THIS WAS A PROCESS AND I BELIEVE THAT THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR ADDRESSED THIS LATE -- SORT OF LATE IN THE GAME. AND SO WE NEED TO BALANCE THE NEEDS OF THE NEIGHBORHOODS, BUT I STILL THINK THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME TYPE OF GRANDFATHERING IN OF THE EXISTING SHORT-TERM RENTALS AND SO I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT DIRECTION TO STAFF. THANK YOU.
01:25:37.098: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
01:25:38.333: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANKS. EVENTUALLY THIS WILL BE A QUESTION TO STAFF, IF YOU WANT TO START MAKING YOUR WAY UP. THANK YOU. SO I APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK THAT WENT INTO THIS AND FACILITATING THE COMMUNITY CONVERSATION. THIS WAS A REALLY RICH PROCESS OF ENGAGING EVERYONE WHO CARES ABOUT THIS ISSUE, AND FOR THAT VERY GRATEFUL. YOU KNOW, I'M READY TO TAKE THIS ACTION AND GIVE THIS DIRECTION, HOWEVER, I THINK THAT THE DETAILS ARE GOING TO BE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. SO I WANT TO LOOK AT THE PROCESS THAT GETS US FROM HERE TO JULY 30th.
01:26:20.008: >> GOOD EVENING, MAYOR AND COUNCIL I'M PRE BRETT LEINART. THERE'S A LOT OF RANGING CONCERNS, OPINIONS ABOUT THIS MATTER, AND I APPRECIATE THE WORDS WE WERE PROUD OF THE PROCESS TO OPEN UP OUR EARS AND OUR INPUT BROADLY TO HEAR WHAT THE COMMUNITY'S CONCERNS AND STRENGTHS THAT THEY SAW AS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE CITY. SO THIS IS JUST THAT. IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY HOPEFULLY FOR US TO VALIDATE HOW WE ARE CONSIDERING AND MOVING FORWARD TOWARDS THAT JULY DEADLINE. THAT PROCESS WOULD MOST LIKELY TAKE THIS DIRECTION FROM YOU, IF THIS IS THE DIRECTION YOU WANT TO GO AND THEN WE WOULD WORK TO IMPLEMENT THAT IN THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY THAT WE THINK APPROPRIATE. WHETHER THAT'S INCLUSIVE OF LAND USE REGULATIONS, OTHER REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS, AND DO OUR BEST TO PUT FORTH WHAT WE FORESEE ANY CHALLENGES OR OPPORTUNITIES FOR MONITORING AND ENFORCEMENT AND HOW THAT SHOULD BE ADEQUATELY RESOURCED.
01:27:32.280: >> Councilmember Ackerman: AND SO ON JULY 30th OR SHORTLY THEREAFTER, DO YOU ANTICIPATE RELEASING A DRAFT OF THAT ORDINANCE AND THEN WOULD THERE BE A PERIOD FOR PUBLIC INPUT AGAIN?
01:27:45.427: >> I WOULD ANTICIPATE PUBLIC INPUT AT A MINIMUM THROUGH THE DRAFTING PROCESS FOR ANY LAND USE REGULATIONS THROUGH THE PLANNING COMMISSION. THAT WOULD ALSO BE SHARED WIDELY AS ANY PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENTS ARE THROUGH THE UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE. SO I WOULD ANTICIPATE THAT WE ARE PRESENTING A MORE VETTED AND FINALIZED RECOMMENDATION TO YOU, BASED ON ADVICE OF STAFF AS TO HOW TO ACHIEVE THE GOALS THAT YOU DIRECTED US TO DO SO AND ANY CORRESPONDING ADVICE FROM ANY APPROPRIATE BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS ■THAT MIGHT BE INVOLVED.
01:28:14.856: >> Councilmember Ackerman: OKAY. THANK YOU.
01:28:18.893: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:28:20.562: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. I GUESS I WILL HAVE A QUESTION OR TWO FOR STAFF BEFORE MAKING A STATEMENT. THE QUESTION, WE HAD A COUNCILMEMBER SUGGEST GRANDFATHERING IN EXISTING LOCATIONS. IS THAT EVEN LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE?
01:28:43.184: >> SO RIGHT NOW, WE DON'T SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS SHORT-TERM RENTALS IN OUR ORDINANCE, ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. WE HAVE A LOT OF OTHER USES AND THUS FAR, THAT'S HOW THEY HAVE BEEN FALLING INTO THE CONFINES OF OUR EXISTING DEVELOPMENT. DEPENDING ON WHICH OF THESE SORT OF ASPECTS COUNCIL DIRECTS US TO DO, I CAN'T REALLY SAY DEFINITIVELY WHAT -- WHETHER THAT WOULD BE VIABLE OR NOT, A LOT OF THAT DEPENDS ON WHAT REGULATIONS ARE ULTIMATELY PUT FORWARD AND WHERE THEY ARE ACTUALLY MANIFESTED IN OUR CODES. SO AT THIS POINT, I JUST DON'T KNOW. I MEAN, THE BEST DIRECTION I CAN TAKE AS A PLANNING MANAGER RIGHT NOW IS TO BE CLEAR AS TO THE TYPES OF REGULATIONS THAT YOU SEE AS WORTH EXPLORING AND WE'LL PRESENT THE BEST SET OF ORDINANCES WHEREVER THOSE MAY FALL TO IMPLEMENT THOSE.
01:29:35.537: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: NOINOWSPEAKING WITH DEREK LAST I WAS TOLD THAT THERE WOULD BE AREAS THAT STAFF WOULD SUGGEST IN THIS ORDINANCE ALLOW FOR THESE SHORT-TERM RENTALS TO EXIST THAT ARE WE TARGETING JUST SINGLE FAMILY ZONING OR ARE WE PROHIBITING IT THROUGHOUT THE CITY LIMITS?
01:29:57.692: >> SO THE WAY WE ARE CONSIDERING IT FROM A STAFF PERSPECTIVE IS NOT THROUGHOUT THE CITY LIMITS. WE ARE VERY MUCH THINKING ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THESE USES AND THE NATURE OF THESE USES. AT WHAT POINT DO THEY PERHAPS CHANGE FROM TRULY A RESIDENTIAL NEWS TO A MORE COMMERCIAL OR ENTERPRISE USE? AND WE PROVIDE A WIDE RANGE OF DISTRICTS IN THE CITY THAT WE PROVIDE A FLEXIBILITY OF THE MULTIPLE USES BOTH RESIDENTIAL AND NONRESIDENTIAL. I THINK THERE'S AMPLE OPPORTUNITY TO ALLOW THOSE CONTINUE. I THINK THE MORE SPECIFIC DIRECTION THAT IS ARTICULATED EITHER IN OPTION THREE OR IN SOME OF THE AGENDA QUESTIONS AND IN THE LEGISTAR MEMO IS IF COUNCIL HAS ANY SPECIFIC FEEDBACK AT THIS POINT ABOUT TAKING THAT A STEP FURTHER AS IT RELATES TO THE OTHER TYPES OF RENTAL UNITS, THAT IS THE PRIMARY RESIDENCE, HOME STATE, OR THE PRIMARY RESIDENT'S WHOLE HOUSE. RIGHT NOW OPTION THREE WOULD PROVIDE MORE FRAMEWORK FOR PRIMARY HOME STAY THAN PRIMARY RESIDENTS WHOLE HOUSE. STAFF'S PERSPECTIVE IS ONCE WE START CONSIDERING THE WHOLE HOUSE, THAT PROBABLY CREATES SOME COMPLICATIONS OF REGULATION AND MONITORING. IT'S NOT TO SAY THAT IT'S NOT ATTAINABLE, BUT WHEN -- FROM A LAND USE PERSPECTIVE, OUR INITIAL THOUGHT IS WHETHER YOU AS A RESIDENT ARE VACATING YOUR HOUSE FOR THREE WEEKENDS OR A PROPERTY IS RENTING IT OUT FOR 52 WEEKENDS. THE NATURE STARTS TO DEVIATE FROM A RESIDENTIAL USE.
01:31:32.921: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: OKAY. I APPRECIATE THAT. AND THAT'S ALL THE QUESTIONS I HAVE RIGHT NOW. I APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE. I WILL PUSH BACK A LITTLE BIT ON MY COLLEAGUE'S ASSERTION THAT WE ARE LATE IN THE GAME IN THE WHOLE PROCESS. I THINK THIS IS A RECENT PHENOMENON THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY SINCE THE LAST GREAT RECESSION AND I DON'T NECESSARILY THINK THAT WE ARE LATE TO IT. WE ARE A SMALL COMMUNITY WITH LIMITED RESOURCES AN A COMPLICATED COMMUNITY WITH A LOT OF DIFFERENT INTERESTS AND ACTIVITIES. THE -- YOU KNOW, THE ISSUE THAT WE HAVE AND WE HAVE HEARD ARE NUMEROUS ARE TRUE, AND THE CURRENT SITUATION IS -- OF THE STATUS QUO IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. AND FRANKLY, GOING BACK TO MY FIRST QUESTION ABOUT GRANDFATHERING AND WE CAN'T EVEN GRANDFATHER THEM IN BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY EXIST. AND WHEN DO WE START THAT CLOCK? SO, YOU KNOW, WE DON'T EVEN HAVE REGISTRATION AND INFORMATION ON THE NUMBERS AND LOCATIONS TO ANY SORT OF RELIABLE STANDARD. SO, YOU KNOW, I JUST FIND THIS, YOU KNOW, SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. AND I DON'T WANT TO DISRUPT A HORNET'S NEST BUT I PROBABLY WILL. THIS IS WHERE YOU SEE CAPITAL, UNBRIDLED CAPITAL WORKING IN WAYS THAT I DON'T THINK BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY TO THE DEGREE THAT IS BEING PERPETRATED TO BENEFIT. I DO USE AIRBNBs WHEN I TRAVEL BUT I ALSO KNOW THE COSTS THAT THEY COME AT. AND I JUST HAVE AN ISSUE WHEN YOU SET UP A BUSINESS IN AN AREA THAT'S NOT ZONED FOR BUSINESS. I MEAN, WE CAN EXTRAPOLATE FOR QUITE SOMETIME WHAT THAT MEANS. BUT THE INTENTION OF THESE SINGLE FAMILY ZONING AREAS OF OUR COMMUNITY WERE NOT INTENDED FOR THIS TYPE OF NEW PHENOMENON. WE WILL HAVE A LOT OF TIME AND A LOT OF PUBLIC INTERPUT AS WE DRAFT THE ORDINANCES AND WHAT THEY MEAN AND HOW THEY REGULATE THIS INDUSTRY, BUT THEY DO HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE COMMUNITY AND I FEEL IT COMES AT THE COST OF THE COMMUNITY AND WE CANNOT UNFORTUNATELY AT A LEVEL OF THE CITY TAX THIS INDUSTRY AND USE THE FROM THAT TO PAY FOR THE -- YOU KNOW, THE INTANGIBLES THAT COME ALONG WITH IT. SO UNLESS WE GET TOGETHER AS A COUNTY AND PROPOSE TO TAX THIS, I DON'T SEE THAT AS MY CURRENT OPTION. SO I WILL JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT. I'M WILLING TO LISTEN AND I HOPE THAT WE DO FIND A MIDDLE GROUND WHERE WE DO ALLOW THESE TO CONTINUE TO EXIST IN OUR COMMUNITY. THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT AREAS IN ZONING AND I HOPE WE CAN FIND MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL ORDINANCE.
01:35:02.263: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, AND GRISWOLD.
01:35:07.568: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANKS, MR. MAYOR. I APPRECIATE THE PUBLIC'S INPUT ON THIS. AND I HAD SOME REALLY GOOD CONVERSATIONS WITH SOME OF MY NEIGHBORS WHO BOTH OWNER OCCUPIED AND NOT OWNER OCCUPIED, AND ONE INSTANCE BOTH, I ALSO BRING A SORT OF DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE FOR IT BECAUSE I DO MAINTENANCE ON PROPERTIES AND I DO THEM ON SHORT-TERM RENTALS AND LONG-TERM RENTALS AND HOMES AND BUSINESSES. AND THE DIFFERENTIATION THAT WE HEAR BEING TALKED ABOUT HERE TONIGHT IS -- IS PRETTY NEGLIGIBLE WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT HEY, WE SHOULDN'T HAVE S.T. R.s IN AN R1 NEIGHBORHOOD? HOW MANY ARE IN MULTIFAMILY DISTRICTS AND SO ON. I DON'T THINK WE HAVE NEW INFORMATION TO ACT IN A DRACONIAN WAY. LIKE OPTION THREE READS TO ME. SO LET ME JUST SPEAK TO A FEW THINGS. WHEN I TALK ABOUT THE MAINTENANCE ISSUES, EVERY SINGLE OWNER OF THESE SHORT-TERM RENTALS THAT I SPOKE TO, JUST THESE THREE NEIGHBORS, THEY HAD BEEN LONG-TERM RENTAL OPERATORS, AND THEY GO IN AFTER ONE YEAR OR TWO YEARS OR THREE YEARS WHEN THE TENANT WAS OUT AND THE PLACE WOULD BE DESTROYED. THEY WERE SO HAPPY TO HAVE THIS PLATFORM EVOLVE THIS AIRBNB PLATFORM, OR VRBO, THAT THEY ARE IN THERE IN BETWEEN EVERY SINGLE TENANT AND THOSE PLACES HAVE NEVER BEEN BETTER MAINTAINED, THAN I HAVE SEEN THEM EVER. THESE SHORT-TERM RENTALS ARE VERY WELL-MAINTAINS. I WANTED TO SAY THAT AS SOMEONE WHO DOES THE MAINTENANCE. AND WE ARE TALKING ABOUT MAYBE 1500 UNITS, AND SO WE ARE 97% -- WE DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH 97% OF OUR UNITS JUST THIS 3%. AGAIN, IT'S A VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF UNITS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HERE. AND THEIR EFFECT ON AFFORDABILITY IT'S LARGELY HYPOTHETICAL. IF THIS 3% OF UNITS CONVERTING FROM LONG-TERM RENTAL, TO SHORT-TERM RENTAL MAY BE AFFORDABLE OR MAY NOT BE AFFORDABLE, WHAT DO WE SAY OF THE 4,000 CLEARLY UNAFFORDABLE BEDROOMS WE ADDED THROUGH REGULAR DEVELOPMENT? WHEN WE PUT IN ALL OF THESE CONDO TOWERS AND EVERYTHING, THEY ARE NOT AFFORDABLE UNITS AND THAT'S SWAYING THE BALANCE OF OUR AFFORDABLE CRISIS. I'M NOT BUYING THAT ARGUMENT. SO WHEN I LOOK AT -- WHEN I LOOK AT -- I MEAN, A COUPLE OF THINGS. WE WE TALK ABOUT WE ARE CREATING BUSINESSES IN NEIGHBORHOODS. LAURA DOESN'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH ME RUNNING MY SHOP, RUNNING MY HOME OFFICE AND NEITHER DOES THE I.R.S. WHEN I GET GENTRIFIED OUT OF MY LEGAL SHOP SPACE AND IT GETS TORN DOWN AND THEY BUY 51 CONDOS, I MOVED BACK TO MY HOME AND MY SHOP AT HOME. AND LAURA DOESN'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT AND THE I.R.S. AND MY NEIGHBORS DON'T COMPLAIN AND I DON'T HAVE NOISE PROBLEMS. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THESE COMPLAINTS, I REALLY WONDER HOW MANY -- WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE AAPD IS HUSTLING FOR SHORT-TERM RENTAL COMPLAINTS VERSUS LONG-TERM RENTAL COMPLAINTS WHICH WE KNOW ARE A PROBLEM? AGAIN, I THINK WE HAVE TO TEMPER OUR QUESTION OF OVER REGULATION OF THIS. SO I MEAN, THOSE ARE THE BIG THINGS. THE PLATFORMS, I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY FOLKS ON COUNCIL USE THEM, I KNOW SOME OF THEM DO. THE PLATFORM HAS ITS OWN CONTROLS. IF YOU HAVE A BAD TENANT OR BAD RENTER, NOT ONLY CAN YOU CALL THE PLACE. YOU CAN CALL THE HOST, TO USE AIRBNB'S PARLANCE. I NEVER HAD A PROBLEM USING AIRBNBs IN OUR TRAVELS BECAUSE WE ARE GOOD OCCUPIERS BUT I KNOW A BAD GUEST CAN GET SINGLED RIGHT OW A OUT AND NOT BE ALLOWO STAY. THAT'S A BIG ISSUE. I THINK IT'S PROPER THAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT THESE EXIST IN OUR COMMUNITY AND IT'S ALSO PROPER THAT WE PERHAPS KEEP A LIST OF WHERE THEY ARE. BECAUSE IT FULFILLS OUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A COUNCIL AND CITY TO LOOK OUT FOR GUESTS ALIKE. WITH YOU TALK ABOUT OPTION THREE, REGULATE PRIMARY RESIDENCE HOME STAY, FEES AND REQUIRED INSPECTIONS. SO LET'S SAY I HAVE A SPACE. MY KID MOVES TO COLLEGE. MY SISTER COMES HERE FROM OVERSEAS AND WANTS TO STAY FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS AND I THINK THAT WORKED OUT OKAY. I WANT TO PUT IT ON AIRBNB FOR A WEEKEND AND NOW I WILL PAY A FEE AND I WILL REQUIRE THE CITY TO COME INTO MY PRIVATE RESIDENCE. MY RESIDENCE IS UP TO CODE BUT THE REGULATIONS THAT WE APPLY TO RENTAL PROPERTIES ARE DIFFERENT THAN THE REGULATIONS WE APPLY TO RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES. THERE'S ALL KINDS OF THINGS IN THE RENTAL PROPERTY CODE THAT YOU WOULDN'T COME INTO MY HOUSE AND SAY, HEY, THAT HANDRAIL DOESN'T HAVE PROPER RETURNS AT THE TOP AND BOTTOM. ARE ALL THE BACKFLOW PREVENTERS IN PLACE? ARE THERE ANY CHIPS IN YOUR ENAMEL IF WE TAKE THE INTERNATIONAL CODE. ARE THERE ANY CHIPS IN YOUR ENAMEL. THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT GET A WRITE-UP THAT YOU WOULD NEVER DO TO  A PRIVATE HOMEOWNER. I THINK THIS IS A GROSS OVERREACH. I THINK IT'S A SOLUTION IN SEARCH OF A PROBLEM. THE MORE I LOOK AT IT, I THINK, WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO DO HERE? WHAT ARE OUR GOALS FOR REGULATING THESE? CAN SOMEONE TELL ME WHAT THOSE ARE? TELL ME WHAT THEY ARE, AND CONVINCE ME TO SUPPORT IT? WHAT ARE THE GOALS FOR REGULATION? IS TO INCREASE PUBLIC SAFETY? IS IT TO CREATE A LICENSING PROGRAM BECAUSE WE HAVE CERTAIN SPECIFIC CONCERNS? IS IT TO RAISE MONEY FOR THE CITY BY THE TAXABLE VALUE?
01:41:00.855: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER?
01:41:01.522: >> Councilmember Hayner:  WHAT ARE OUR GOALS? SOMEONE TELL ME WHAT THEY ARE, AND PERHAPS I WILL SUPPORT IT. IT'S TOO MUCH. OPTION THREE IS TOO MUCH AND FRANKLY, OPTION ONE IS A LITTLE TOO MUCH.
01:41:11.966: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER.
01:41:12.633: >> Councilmember Hayner:  IT'S JUST TOO MUCH.
01:41:14.068: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. COUNCILMEMBER GRAND. [ APPLAUSE ] COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
01:41:23.844: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. THIS IS -- THIS IS ONE THAT'S BEEN TRICKIER FOR ME THAN USUAL, I WOULD SAY WHERE I CAN HONESTLY SEE BOTH SIDES OF THE ARGUMENT, AND IT'S REALLY MADE ME LOOK AT ARGUMENTS OF PEOPLE THAT I FRANKLY OFTEN DISAGREE WITH, AND LOOK AT ARGUMENTS THAT ARE MADE BY PEOPLE THAT I MIGHT TEND TO AGREE WITH MORE AND I HAVE TO LOOK AT THESE THINGS CAREFULLY. ONE, I AM GOING TO SUPPORT THIS TONIGHT, BECAUSE -- BECAUSE I'M SUPPORTIVE OF A LOT OF WHAT'S IN THE OPTIONS. I DON'T KNOW THAT I'M ACTUALLY SUPPORTIVE OF EVERYTHING THAT'S IN OPTION THREE, BUT I AM SUPPORTIVE OF THIS PROCESS MOVING FORWARD, AND I THINK THERE ARE AMPLE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PUBLIC INPUT. AND I REALLY -- WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE COMPLAINTS THAT I TEND TO GET FROM CONSTITUENTS ABOUT SHORT-TERM RENTALS, IT TENDS TO BE -- WE DON'T KNOW WHO THE CONTACT PERSON IS. THERE'S A PROBLEM. WE DON'T KNOW WHO TO CALL. SO I THINK THESE OCCUPANCY -- OR THERE ARE NINE PEOPLE IN THIS, YOU KNOW, THROWING A PARTY IN THIS HOUSE NEXT TO ME, AND WHAT DO I DO? SO I THINK THE OCCUPANCY LICENSING, LOCAL CONTACT PERSON THAT SEEMS FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, A SLAM DUNK TO PUT INTO THE ORDINANCE THAT BOTH SIDES IF YOU ARE BEING REASONABLE COULD AGREE TO. SO I WANT TO MOVE THE PROCESS IF NOTHING ELSE FOR THAT REASON BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF VALUE THERE. I DO USE THIS PLATFORM FOR VACATIONS AND WHEN I GO TO LARGER CITIES OR VACATION AREAS. I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE ARE PROVIDERS OF SHORT-TERM SERVICE PROVIDERS THAT ARE OF VALUE. IF YOU ARE HERE AT THE MEDICAL CENTER AND YOU WANT TO STAY SOMEWHERE. IF YOU ARE HERE VISITING FOR A FEW WEEKS AT A TIME. I DO BELIEVE THAT THIS IS VALUE TO THAT. I'M JUST NOT SURE WHEN I RATE -- WHEN I WEIGH THE PROS AND CONS THAT THE VALUE TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS OVERRIDES THE VALUE OF A FAMILY BEING ABLE TO LIVE IN A HOUSE OR SOMEONE NOT LIVING NEXT TO A COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISE. SO THIS IS REALLY WHAT I HAVE BEEN WRESTLING WITH IT AND IT IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISE THAN SOMEONE WHO IS OPERATING A BUSINESS OUT OF THEIR HOAX. HAVING A CONSTANT FLOW OF PEOPLE LIVING IN A PLACE THAT WAS NOT DESIGN TO BE A -- A HOTEL IS DIFFERENT THAN MY NEIGHBOR GIVING CELLO LESSONS OUT OF HER YARD AND HAVING SOME PEOPLE PARK IN FRONT OF MY HOUSE ON A PUBLIC STREET WHICH THEY ARE TOTALLY ALLOWED TO DO. THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN, YOU KNOW A LOT OF THE COMPLAINTS THAT WE HEAR AND CONCERNS ABOUT NOISE SAFETY, INSTABILITY AND NOT KNOWING WHO TO CONTACT. AND I DON'T THINK THAT THE MONEY THAT GOES INTO UPGRADE THESE FACILITIES ARE SOME OF THE ARGUMENTS WE HAVE LEARNED THAT I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE IN NICER THAN SOME RENTAL PROPERTIES OUTWEIGHS THE BENEFIT OF A FAMILY BEING ABLE TO LIVE IN A HOUSE, PERHAPS MORE AFFORDABLY AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING, I KNOW IT AND I WANT TO SEE THAT DATA TOO. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE STRONGER ANALYSIS THERE TOO, BUT WE OFTEN ARE BATTLING FOR SMALL NUMBER OF UNITS AT A TIME. AND SO I DON'T THINK THAT THIS IS REALLY ANY DIFFERENT THAN WE ARE ADVOCATE FOR TEN UNITS AND A HIGH RISE TO BE AFFORDABLE AS WELL, BUT SOMETIMES WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THE INDIVIDUAL LIVES AND THE INDIVIDUAL FAMILIES WHEN WE THINK ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SO FOR THOSE REASONS I'M SUPPORTING MOVING THIS FORWARD BUT HOPE THAT WE CAN HAVE SOME CONTINUED NEGOTIATIONS AS WE -- AS WE GO FORWARD.
01:45:15.109: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
01:45:16.243: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES, I WOULD LIKE TO ASK OUR ATTORNEY IF HE HAS ANY INFORMATION TO SHARE WITH US ON THIS TOPIC.
01:45:24.618: >> City Atty. Postema: ON THE SHORT-TERM RENTALS?
01:45:29.923: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES.
01:45:31.859: >> City Atty. Postema: WE DON'T AT THIS TIME. MR. McDONALD IS WORKING ON VARIOUS LEGAL SCENARIOS AND THAT WILL BE PART OF THIS PROCESS.
01:45:41.135: >> Councilmember Griswold: OKAY. GOOD. I HAVE RECEIVED SOME INFORMATION.
01:45:45.105: >> City Atty. Postema: THAT WILL BE PART OF --
01:45:46.273: >> Councilmember Griswold: OKAY. THANK YOU.
01:45:48.909: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. COUNCILMEMBER NELSON?
01:45:52.079: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I HAVE A QUESTION FOR STAFF. I WENT TO ALL THREE OF THE CARLISLE WARTMAN MEETINGS AND THEY WERE MAPPED PRESENTED WHERE THE HIGH TRAFFIC LOCATIONS. IN LOOKING AT THOSE LOCATIONS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED BY CARLISLE WARTMAN, DID YOU DRAW ANY CONNECTION BETWEEN WHAT THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS AND, LIKE, ZONING -- I MEAN, I GUESS I'M WONDERING ARE THERE ANY IMPLICATIONS FOR MASTER PLANNING? I'M LOOKING AT ONE OF THE POSSIBILITIES OF REGULATING BY GEOGRAPHY AND SORT OF CREATING DISTRICTS. DID YOU DRAW ANY CONCLUSIONS FROM WHERE YOU SAW MORE ACTIVITY?
01:46:35.489: >> WE DIDN'T. ONE OF THE PROBLEMS AND THE LIMITATIONS OF THAT DATA IS WE CAN'T SPECIFICALLY PINPOINT IT TO ADDRESSES. THERE'S VARIABILITY WHERE IT'S LOCATED. IT'S LATITUDE AND LONGITUDE, AND TO TRY TO LINK THAT MORE ACCURATE TO PROPERTIES, WE COULDN'T DO IT IN SUCH A WAY THAT WE FELT THAT -- AND THERE WAS ENOUGH VARIABILITY IN IT WHERE THERE MIGHT BE -- IT MIGHT BE ALONG ZONING DISTRICT BOUNDARIES. WE COULD LOOK AT THAT AGAIN. IT COULD BE MORE OF A CATEGORY, INSTEAD OF DISTRICT BY DISTRICT. IN SHORT, NO, WE HAVE BEEN BASING THE RECOMMENDATIONS ON SORT OF FROM A USE PERSPECTIVE AND SOME OF THE FEEDBACK WE HEARD.
01:47:17.698: >> Councilmember Nelson: OKAY.
01:47:18.432: >> I THINK I WANT TO JUMP IN BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF COMMENTARY TOO ON WHY STAFF MAYBE MADE SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS IT DID IN THE WAY AND IN THE MANNER THAT IT DID. THE MORE WE TALKED ABOUT, THIS MORE SO THAN GEOGRAPHY AND A LOT OF IT HAS BEEN MENTIONED ABOUT HOME OCCUPATIONS AND BEING ABLE TO RUN BUSINESSES OUT OF THEIR HOMES AND ONE THE CONSISTENTS THROUGHOUT THAT, WITHIN OUR CITY ZONING ORDINANCE AND EVERYTHING ELSE, ONE OF THE PRIMARY REQUIREMENTS OF THAT IS THAT THE OWNER LIVE IN THE PROPERTY. YOU CAN'T BUY A HOUSE AND RUN A BUSINESS THERE IF YOU DON'T LIVE THERE. NOWHERE IN THE CITY AND IN NO RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT IS THAT ALLOWED. WE DO ALLOW EXACTLY WHAT WAS DESCRIBED BY THE COUNCILMEMBERS UP HERE. IF YOU LIVE IN YOUR HOME, YOU CAN HAVE AN ARCHITECT'S OFFICE AND TEACH MUSIC LESSONS BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, THE PRIMARY USE OF THE PROPERTY HAS TO BE OWNED AND THE PRIMARY USE OF IT IS HAS TO BE OCCUPIED BY THE RESIDENT. IF YOU HAVE AN OWNER OCCUPIED PROPERTY IN THE SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENT, THE OWNER LIVES THERE AND OCCUPIES AND IS AN MEMBER OF THE CITY. WHETHER IT'S THREE MONTHS, SIX MONTHS OR A YEAR, IF THE OWNER OF A PROPERTY LEASES DIRECTLY TO A TENANT THAT TENANT BECOMES A RESIDENT OF THE CITY AND MORE OR LESS OCCUPIES THAT PROPERTY WITH SOME RIGHTS. MY UNDERSTANDING AND MR. McDONALD IS NOT HERE TONIGHT, THAT IS THE BREAK POINT FOR US IN OUR RECOMMENDATION IS IN A SINGLE FAMILY NEIGHBORHOOD THAT DOESN'T EXIST UNDER A SHORT-TERM RENTAL SCENARIO UNDER VBRO, OR AIRBNB. THE PEOPLE OCCUPYING THOSE PROPERTIES, THEY DON'T HAVE LEASES WHERE THEY TAKE OCCUPANCY OF THE PROPERTY. THEREFORE, IT STARTS TO RUN AFOUL OF WHAT THE INTENT OF THOSE ZONING DISTRICTS ARE, WHICH IS TO HAVE SINGLE FAMILY HOMES AS A PRIMARY USE. YOU CAN, ONCE YOU ESTABLISH AS THAT AS THE PRIMARY DO ALL TYPES OF THINGS AND INCIDENTAL AND ACCESSORY TO THAT PRIMARY, WHETHER OR NOT IT'S AS A PRIMARY USING -- RENTING OUT PORTIONS OF YOUR HOME, WHETHER THROUGH AIRBNB AND SHORT-TERM STAYS BUT WHERE WE CAME TO OUR BREAK POINT WAS AS LONG AS THE PRIMARY WAS STILL THAT THE OCCUPANT OF THE HOME OWNED IT AND OCCUPIED IT, WE WERE COMFORTABLE WITH THE USE OF IT, WHETHER IT'S LONG-TERM OR SHORT-TERM RENTAL, FOR THOSE USES. WHERE WE STARTED TO MAKE OUR RECOMMENDATION HEADING TOWARDS OUR OPTION THREE WAS WHEN YOU DON'T -- WHEN YOU BUY A HOME AND YOU DON'T OCCUPY IT AND NOBODY OCCUPIES IT AND THERE'S NO RESIDENT THAT LIVES THIS, IT SEEMS TO US TO START TO RUN AFOUL OF THE INTENT OF THE SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD RAILROADMENTS. AND THAT'S WHERE THE CRUX OF OUR RECOMMENDATION -- MUCH TO OUR SURPRISE, FROM WHERE WE STARTED ON THIS PROCESS, CAME FROM. HOW WE GET THERE THROUGH REGULATION IS OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO WORK OUT AND WE ARE INTERESTED AND NEED FEEDBACK FROM COUNCIL, WHETHER YOU GUYS AGREE WITH THAT IS KIND OF A JUMPING OFF POINT. WE KNOW THERE'S GOING TO BE NUANCE TO THAT. WE KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF, IN ABOUT HOW TO DO THAT, HOW TO ENFORCE IT AND I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO QUAKILY TOUCH ON THE GRANDFATHERING THING. GRANDFATHERING THESE FACILITIES IN IS DIFFICULT BECAUSE WE DON'T CLASSIFY OR CERTIFY RENTALS AS EITHER LONG OR SHIRT TERM, THEY ARE RENTAL PROPERTIES. WHETHER OR NOT IT'S A SHORT-TERM LEASE OR NOT, WE DON'T TRACK THAT NOW. SO HAVE A POINT TO SAY HOW MANY WE HAVE IN THE CITY PER WHAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE CERTIFIED WOULD BE INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT FOR US TO DO. WE HAVE INFORMATION THAT SOME OF OUR CERTIFIED RENTALS ARE RENTED THROUGH PLATFORMS LIKE AIRBNB AND OTHER SHORT-TERM MAT FORMS FORMS -- PLATFORMS BUT WE DON'T KEEP THAT AS A CATEGORY  WITHIN THE CITY. I WANTED TO ADD THAT AS CLARIFICATION AT THIS POINT.
01:51:17.771: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER NELSON, YOU STILL HAVE THE FLOOR.
01:51:19.539: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I HAVE A FEW COMMENTS, ACTUALLY. I APPRECIATE YOUR EXPLANATION OF THAT. MY FAMILY WAS RECENTLY TRAVELING AND WE TRAVELED TO A COMMUNITY THAT I WALKED UP TO THE HOUSE WE WERE STAYING AT, THE AIRBNB AND THERE WAS A BIG SIGN ON OUTSIDE OF THE HOUSE, A SHORT-TERM RENTAL HOT LINE. IT SENT ME GOOGLING AND I HAD THE SPECIFIC EXAMPLE OF THIS TOWN THAT I HAPPENED TO BE STAYING IN. SO A LOT OF THESE REGULATIONS WERE SORT OF PUT INTO A REAL WORLD CONTEXT FOR ME, JUST RECENTLY. THEY FELT VERY HYPOTHETICAL WHEN THEY FIRST PRESENTED TO US, BUT I BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND THEM MORE WHEN I FOUND A SPECIFIC TOWN TO LOOK AT. SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT WE HEARD FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE IN SUPPORT OF LEAVING WELL ENOUGH ALONE, I'M REALLY STRUGGLING TO SEE THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT THAT -- THAT YOU ARE ASKING US TO RECOGNIZE. I DO NOT SEE AIRBNBs AS A BLIGHT ON ANY COMMUNITY. I HAVE NOT HEARD ANYONE DESCRIBE THEM THAT WAY. I -- I DO KNOW THAT THEY ARE TAKING AWAY HOUSING THAT WE WOULD RATHER -- OR WE HAVE THE CHOICE TO DECIDE THAT WE WOULD RATHER SEE LONG-TERM RESIDENTS OCCUPYING. I HAVE THE ANECDOTAL EXPERIENCE OF HAVING WORK DONE ON MY HOUSE RECENTLY AND HAVING TO BE AWAY FROM IT FOR A NIGHT AND IT WAS DURING THE WEEK. IT WAS NOT -- THERE WERE NOT ANY SPECIFIC EVENTS GOING ON IN TOWN AND NO PARTICULAR REASON FOR ME EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTY IN FINDING AN AIRBNB. I. THI THOUGHT THIS WILL BE AN N INTERESTING EXPERIENCE IN AN AIRBNB. I COULD NOT FIND AN AIRBNB, IN MY SORT OF NEAR DOWNTOWN NEIGHBORHOOD FOR LESS THAN $250 A NIGHT AND MY FAMILY ENDED UP STAYING OUT BY BRIARWOOD IN AN APARTMENT SETTING WHERE I HAD ACCESS TO A KITCHEN. AND IT WASN'T AS CONVENIENT BECAUSE I WASN'T CLOSE TO THE BUS STOPS THAT MY KIDS USE AND THE -- MY OWN WORKPLACE THAT I WALK TO. AS I SEE IT, THE WAY AIRBNBs ARE FUNCTIONING IN OUR TOWN, WE HAVE TOURISTS IN RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS NEAR DOWNTOWN. AND IT STRIKES ME AS A COMMUNITY WE CAN MAKE A CHOICE TO REGULAR REGULATE AT THIS POINT AND TRY TO PROTECT OUR NEAR DOWNTOWN RESIDENTS FOR RESIDENTS WOULD WANT ACCESS ON A DAY-TO-DAY BASIS TO WALKING TO STORES AND WALKING TO THEIR WORKPLACE AND WALKING TO THE BUS STOP. I ASKED STAFF IN ONE OF MY QUESTIONS TO THE AGENDA BECAUSE I WAS WONDERING ABOUT THIS ARGUMENT THAT WE WERE LACKING -- WE ARE LACKING HOTEL ROOMS. WE ARE LOOKING HOUSING FOR TOURISTS AND I SAID HOW MANY HOTEL ROOMS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED IN THE LAST TEN YEARS. AND IN LAST TEN YEARS, ANN ARBOR HAS APPROVED FOR DEVELOPMENT OVER 1,000 HOTEL ROOMS. AND AN ADDITIONAL 577 ARE CURRENTLY UNDER REVIEW. SO I GUESS I'M -- I APPRECIATE AIRBNB WHEN I TRAVEL. I APPRECIATE THAT AIRBNB, THERE WOULD BE USES FOR IT IN THIS COMMUNITY, BUT I THINK WE ARE AT A CROSSROADS NOW AND THERE ARE A LOT OF COMMUNITIES NOW THAT ARE AT CROSSROADS IN TRYING TO DECIDE, ARE WE A TOURISM TOWN THAT'S SUBJECT TO THE WHIM OF SEASONALITY AND PEOPLE COMING IN AND OUT, OR ARE WE PRIMARILY A COMMUNITY WHERE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO LIVE AND WORK IN NEIGHBORHOODS? SO THAT'S WHERE I STAND. I WANT TO ECHO THE WORDS OF -- I FORGET WHO SAID IT, WHETHER IT WAS COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD OR COUNCILMEMBER GRAND, THAT I'M CONFIDENT THAT THERE'S ENOUGH DISCUSSION AHEAD OF US AND THERE'S A LOT OF ROOM FOR OPTION THREE AS A STARTING POINT AND A LOT OF COMMUNITY DISCUSSION AND BACK AND FORTH ABOUT HOW -- HOW WE WANT TO GO ABOUT THIS. BUT I'M GRATEFUL FOR EVERYONE'S ENGAGEMENT IN THIS ISSUE AND PARTICIPATION AND DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS ISSUE BECAUSE I THINK IT'S TIMELY. THANK YOU.
01:55:24.751: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER SMITH.
01:55:29.589: >> Councilmember Smith: EVEN THOUGH I DON'T SUPPORT OPTION THREE, I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO MOVE FORWARD ON THIS AND START THE WORK AND WE CAN MAKE CHANGES AS WE GO. I THINK OPTION THREE IS THE WRONG ANSWER, BUT THAT'S MY TWO CENTS WORTH. THANKS.
01:55:43.837: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
01:55:46.539: >> Councilmember Lumm: I JUST WOULD LIKE TO ALSO THANK STAFF FOR ALL OF YOUR WORK ON THIS AND THE CARLISLE WARTMAN REPORT, THE FACT THAT IT INCLUDED BENCHMARKING OF FIVE COMPARABLE CITIES, I FOUND VERY HELPFUL. AND IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT FOUR OF THE OF THE FIVE DO NOT ALLOW NON-PRIMARY RESIDENTS SHORT-TERM RENTALS. I BELIEVE ONLY COLUMBIA, MISSOURI ALLOWS THAT. AND I THINK THE INFORMATION THAT'S BEEN PROVIDED US THUS FAR, THE -- YOU KNOW, WE KNOW WHERE THESE HIGH VOLUME SHORT-TERM RENTAL PROPERTIES SEEM TO BE CONCENTRATED, AND NOT IN THE SECOND WARD, BUT THE OLD WEST SIDE, THE OLD FOURTH WARD, BURNS PARK AREA AND NOT SURPRISINGLY THE VOLUME OF SHORT-TERM RENTALS ARE HIGHEST IN JULY ART FAIR AND DURING THE FALL FOR THE U OF M FOOTBALL GAMES. THERE'S CERTAINLY A TOURIST CONNECTION AND I APPRECIATE COUNCILMEMBER NELSON POINTING OUT THE NUMBER OF HOTEL ROOMS THAT HAVE BEEN ASKED FOR. I HAPPENED TO SIT ON THE MALLICE CREEK AREA AND MOST OF OUR MEETINGS TORE REVIEW HOTEL SITE PLANS BEFORE THEY -- THEY ARE ADVANCED TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION, AND US ULTIMATELY. SO THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF ACTIVITY IN THAT REGARD AND IT CONTINUES. SO THAT -- I THINK THAT'S NOTEWORTHY AS WELL. AND I DO LOOK FORWARD TO -- WITH THIS, CERTAINLY THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS. AND I DO HOPE, AGAIN, THAT WE CONSIDER DEVELOPING THESE REGULATIONS, SPACING DISTANCE, LOCATIONS, AND LIMITATIONS ON NUMBER OF GUESTS. EVEN THOSE WHERE THE OWNER IS PRESENT DURING THE STAY. OBVIOUSLY TO BE CONSIDERED. THIS WILL BE A LOT OF ENGAGEMENT WITH THE PUBLIC AND ON THIS END OF THINGS. I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AND I APPRECIATE COUNCILMEMBER ZACKERMAN ASKING ABOUT THE PROCESS GOING FORWARD.
01:58:09.182: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION?
01:58:10.884: >> Councilmember Hayner:  CAN I ASK TWO STAFF QUESTIONS. DEREK MAYBE.
01:58:15.555: >> AS LONG AS IT'S NOT TOO SPECIFIC.
01:58:19.092: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I DON'T THINK IT WILL BE. IN OPTION THREE, IT SAYS REGULATE OA OWNER OCCUPIED. YOU ARE SAYING OPTION THREE, WE JUST WON'T ALLOW ANY NONOWNER OCCUPIED AIRBNBs. IS THAT WHAT YOU ARE SAYING THIS?
01:58:37.610: >> YES.
01:58:37.877: >> Councilmember Hayner:  SO IF I HAVE A NEIGHBOR WHO OWNS A DUPLEX THAT IS CURRENTLY WAS A LONG-TERM RENTAL AND IS NOW A SHORT-TERM RENTAL, BOTH UNITS, IT'S ON THE BOOKS WITH THE CITY, AND THEY ARE PAYING THEIR TAXES A NON-PRIMARY RESIDENCE, YOU ARE SAYING IF YOU FIND OUT THAT'S A AIRBNB, YOU ARE GOING TO TELL THEM THEY CAN'T DO SHORT-TERM RENTALS THERE.
01:59:01.668: >> WHICH UNIT? THE UNIT THAT'S OCCUPIED OR THE UNIT THAT'S NOT OCCUPIED.
01:59:07.340: >> Councilmember Hayner:  IT'S ON THE BOOKS A A RENTAL PROPERTY. THEY SWITCHED FROM LONG-TERM RENTALS TO SHORT-TERM RENTALS.
01:59:14.747: >> IF NEITHER UNIT OF THE DUPLEX -- AND I WILL ASK BRETT TO KICK ME IF I'M WRONG HERE. IF YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT A DUPLEX WHICH IS TWO UNITS IF NEITHER UNIT HAS AN OWNER OCCUPANT, THEN IT CAN NOT BE USED AS A SHORT-TERM RENTAL. A REGULAR RENTAL UNDER A REGULAR LEASE SCENARIO, BUT NOT AS A SHORT-TERM RENTAL UNDER THE TRADITIONAL PLATFORMS, NO.
01:59:44.677: >> Councilmember Hayner:  SO WHEN YOU HAVE A BUILDING THAT'S PROPERLY ZONED FOR RENTAL LIKE POWER RENTAL OR SOME TOWER RENTAL RESIDENT BILLING AND IT'S NOT OWNER OCCUPIED BECAUSE IT'S A MANAGEMENT COMPANY IS OCCUPYING THOSE YOU MIGHT SAY, UNTIL THE LONG-TERM TENANT IS SEENED. -- IS SIGNED. WE HAVE A 12-MONTH LEASE BUT WE HAVE EIGHT MONTHS OF UNIVERSITY ATTENDANCE. AND SO HOW ARE WE GOING TO TREAT THE SUBLETTER WHO CHOOSES TO USE AIRBNB AS A PLATFORM TO SUBLET THEIR APARTMENT IN THE SUMMER AND THEY DON'T LIVE THERE ARE WE GOING TO OUTLAW THAT UNDER OPTION THREE.
02:00:26.085: >>> SUBLETTING IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO DISCUSS. I THINK THAT GETS INTO THE OUTLIER ISSUE OR NUANCE. WHEN YOU HAVE A TRADITIONAL LEASE, YOU HAVE AN OCCUPANT. IF THAT OCCUPANT CHOOSES TO SUBLET, THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN NOT HAVING AN OCCUPANT AT ALL. IT'S CERTAINLY A NUANCE WITH WHAT WE ARE DISCUSSING, BUT THERE'S STILL A 12-MONTH LEASE BETWEEN THE OWNER OF THE PROPERTY AND THE TENANT WHO OCCUPIES THE SPACE.
02:00:52.545: >> Councilmember Hayner:  SO LIKE WHEN A --
02:00:54.347: >> THAT TENANT IS THE OCCUPANT RESIDENT OF THE SPACE.
02:00:57.684: >> Councilmember Hayner:  SO I HAVE A COLLEAGUE WHO LIVES IN NORTHVILLE AND HE COMES HERE ON AN OA OCCASIONAL ONCE A YEAR FOR HASH BASH. AND HE GETS AN AIRBNB AND HE GETS THE CHEAPEST ONE. ONE TIME HE RENTED A BEDROOM IN A HOUSE. AND WE WALKED IN THERE AT 2:00 IN THE MORNING AND THERE WAS A GUY SLEEPING ON THE COUCH AND I'M GUESSING HE SLEPT ON THE COUCH SO HE COULD MAKE $60 OFF HIS BEDROOM. WE ARE NEVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO MANAGE THOSE SORTS OF THINGS. AND I FEAR THAT WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO APPLY THE LAW FAIRLY. BECAUSE THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE SITUATIONS LIKE THAT, WHERE IT'S JUST A POP UP AIRBNB, I NEED $60 TO GET A BUS TICKET HOME. NO PROBLEM, I WILL STUFF ALL OF MY STUFF IN MY ROOMMATE PEACE'S CLOSET. AND MAYBE THEY AREN'T ALL LONG-TERM LEASES THAT MAYBE SOME ARE BEING HELD ASIDE AND DONE SHORT TERM BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT IT PAYS MORE TO AIRBNB THAN IT DOES TO DO A LONG-TERM RENTAL. WE HAVE AN EXAMPLE ON ASHLEY. IT WAS A TWO BEDROOM APARTMENT UPSTAIRS AND THE WOMAN NI FLIPPD IT TO AIRBNB AND THEY'S MAKING MORE IN SIX MONTHS THAN IN A YEAR I HAVE LONG-TERM RENTALS. WE KNOW THE PROFIT MOTIVE IS THERE. I WONDER ABOUT THE LAWFUL USES FOR PROPERTIES. SO MY SECOND QUESTION, DEREK, IF WE ADOPT OPTION THREE, ARE WE GOING TO HAVE TO PUT ON FULL-TIME STAFF TO HANDLE THESE INSPECTIONS AND LICENSING AND ALL OF THAT?
02:02:41.187: >> WELL, ONE OF THE CONVERSATIONS WE HAVE -- AND, AGAIN, THAT'S -- WE HAVEN'T DETERMINED EXACTLY WHAT WE WOULD NEED AS FAR AS ADDITIONAL STAFFING, IF ANY. WHAT'S DIFFICULT FOR US, IN ENFORCEMENT, IS SOME OF THE MIDDLE GROUND ORDINANCES YOU HEAR ABOUT, WHERE WE HAVE TO COUNT NIGHTS AND HOW DO WE COUNT NIGHTS AND HOW DO WE VERIFY SOMEONE WHO ONLY USED A PROPERTY 14 NIGHTS VERSUS 30 NIGHTS VERSUS 35. IT'S CERTAINLY MUCH EASIER FOR US TO ENFORCE MORE STRAIGHT LINE REGULATION THAN IT IS WHEN YOU GET INTO ASKING STAFF TO TRY TO MAKE DETERMINATION ABOUT HOW MANY NIGHTS A PROPERTY IS USED FOR A CERTAIN USE OR NOT, WHETHER THE OWNER IS ACTUALLY IN THE PROPERTY OR NOT, AND HOW MANY NIGHTS. WE HAVE ABOUT 30-SOME ODD THOUSAND RENTAL UNITS THAT WE REGULATE AND INSPECT ON A REGULAR BASE WITNESS FULL-TIME STAFF. WE WOULD HAVE TO SEE THE NUMBER OF ACTUAL SHORT-TERM RENTALS THAT REGISTERED FOR US AND WANTED TO BE INSPECTED AND CERTIFIED BEFORE WE DETERMINE WHAT OUR ACTUAL ADDITIONAL STAFFING NEED WAS. PUTTING THE REGULATION IN PLACE WILL CERTAINLY MAKE IT EASIER FOR US TO ENFORCE THE ORDINANCE, THAN UNDER THE SITUATION WE HAVE NOW, WHERE WE DON'T HAVE A DEFINED SET OF CRITERIA TO ENFORCE AND ARE TRYING TO TAKE WHAT WE HAVE NOW, SITUATIONALLY IN THE CITY, AND FIT IT WITHIN OUR EXISTING HOUSING ORDINANCE. SO REGARDLESS OF WHAT THOSE NEEDS ARE, AS FAR AS STAFF IS CONCERNED, HAVING A DEFINED SET OF CRITERIA, REGARDLESS OF WHAT THAT ENDS UP BEING WILL BE EASIER FOR US TO MAKE THAT DETERMINATION.
02:04:26.759: >> Councilmember Hayner:  SO SPEAKING TO THE INSPECTION, WHAT SET OF RULES AND GUIDELINES WOULD YOU USE? WOULD IT BE A RENTAL INSPECTION OR RESIDENTIAL INSPECTION? IT WOULD BE A RENTAL INSPECTION? SO OWNER OCCUPIED, A ROOM AND OWNER OCCUPIED HOME WHERE THE PERSON HAD ACCESS TO THE KITCHEN AND THE BATHROOM, ALL OF THOSE PARTS OF THAT HOME WOULD FALL UNDER A RENTAL INSPECTION REQUIREMENT AND THE REST OF THE HOME WOULD BE RESIDENTIALLY INSPECTED?
02:04:52.685: >> WELL, WE HAVEN'T MADE THAT DETERMINATION YET. IN THE DISTRICTS WHERE RENTALS ARE ALLOWED SHORT TERM OR OTHERWISE, NONOWNER OCCUPIED, THOSE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO BE INSPECTIONS AND REGISTERED THE SAME AS ANY OTHER RENTAL PROPERTY IN THE CITY. NOTHING WOULD BE BANNED ACROSS THE CITY. IT MAY REQUIRE THAT SHORT-TERM RENTALS IN CERTAIN RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS ONLY TAKE PLACE IN OWNER OCCUPIED HOMES. ONE OF THE QUESTIONS WE HAVE FOR YOU AND ONE OF THE QUESTIONS WE ARE STILL TRYING TO DECIDE IS IF YOU HAVE AN OWNER OCCUPIED HOME THAT DOES PARTICIPATE IN SHORT-TERM RENTAL FOR A PORTION, A ROOM, A GRANNY FLAT OR SOMETHING THAT'S LEGALLY CONFORMING TO THEIR PROPERTY DOES COUNCIL WANT TO SEE US INSPECT THAT PROPERTY THE SAME WAY WE WOULD ANY OTHER REGISTERED RENTAL? CURRENTLY WE DO NOT. WE DO NOT, WHETHER IT'S A SHORT-TERM OR A LONG-TERM RENTAL. IF IT IS AN OWNER OCCUPIED STRUCTURE, WE DO NOT REQUIRE IT TO BE INSPECTED AND CERTIFIED WITH THE CERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE. BECAUSE THE OWNER IS THE PRIMARY OCCUPANT AND MAY TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THOSE UNDER THEIR ROOF, WE DON'T INSPECT IT. WE INSPECT PROPERTIES WHERE THE OWNER IS ABSENT AND THE PEOPLE LIVING THIS HAVE A CERTAIN EXPECTATION THAT THE CITY IS INVOLVED AND CERTIFIED THOSE PROPERTIES AS SAFE FOR OCCUPANCY.
02:06:17.737: >> >> Councilmember Hayner:  AND THAT COMES WITH THE AGENT LICENSED WITHIN 25 MILES? THAT'S ALL PART OF THAT?
02:06:26.946: >> CORRECT. ONE OF THE DECISIONS THAT HAS TO BE MADE. THERE WILL BE THE ABILITY TO DO SHORT-TERM RENTAL IN OWNER OCCUPIED PROPERTIES THROUGHOUT THE CITY, SHOULD THE CITY INSPECT THOSE AND CERTIFY THE SAME WAY WE DO AS NONOWNER OCCUPIED RENTALS? AND WE'RE GOING AROUND IN CIRCLES AS STAFF AS WELL. THAT'S ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WILL COME BACK AS PART OF THE ORDINANCE, DEPENDING WHAT DECISION IS MADE HERE TONIGHT. IT'S STILL SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO FINALIZE. WE WILL COME BACK WITH A RECOMMENDATION. BUT IF COUNCIL HAS ANY INPUT ON THAT TONIGHT, WE WOULD CERTAINLY LIKE TO HEAR IT.
02:07:01.347: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU FOR ANSWERING ALL OF THAT.
02:07:04.984: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THE RESOLUTION AS IT IS, AND I GUESS WHAT I'M HEARING FROM COUNCIL IS THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE -- BECAUSE A LITTLE BIT OF FLUX AS TO WHERE PEOPLE ARE. IF THIS PASSES, I HAVE WOULD SUGGEST AND REQUEST THAT COUNCILMEMBERS COMMUNICATE TO STAFF IF THEY HAVE ANY POINTS OF DEVIATION FROM OPTION THREE, THAT WAY STAFF CAN CATALOGUE THAT, THINK IT THROUGH, AND THEN, YOU KNOW, MOVE FORWARD, INCORPORATE THAT INTO AT THE RECOMMENDATION PROCESS. FOR ME, THE KEY DIFFERENCE -- FOLKS THAT AVAIL THEMSELVES OF AIRBNBs, OF SHORT-TERM RENTALS, THEY DO NOT BECOME PART OF OUR COMMUNITY, AND PEOPLE WHO MOVE INTO RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS HAVE AN EXPECTATION THAT THEY ARE MOVING INTO A NEIGHBORHOOD, THAT THEY ARE MOVING INTO A COMMUNITY. AND THE PROLIFERATION OF SHORT-TERM RENTALS, FRUSTRATES THAT IMPECTATION THAT. FOR ME IS A KEY DIFFERENCE. THERE ARE -- YOU KNOW, THERE'S INCOMPLETE DATA AS TO SAFETY THERE'S INCOMPLETE DATA AS TO THE EFFECT ON PRICING, BUT I THINK THAT THE ABSENCE OF COMMUNITY IS UNANSWERABLE AND FOR ME, IS OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE.
02:08:44.083: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
02:08:45.050: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE MR. DELACOURT'S INSIGHTS INTO THIS. I THINK IT SPEAKS TO THE STRENGTH OF THE PROCESS AND THE AMOUNT OF THOUGHT THAT WENT INTO THIS. I DO APPRECIATE THE RECOMMENDATION TO US THAT WE DO HAVE AN ORDINANCE THAT IS CLEAR, THAT IS RELATIVELY ELOQUENT AND STRAIGHTFORWARD AND THERE IS NOT AS MUCH ROOM FOR MISINTERPRETATION AND I WANT TO CAUTION MY COLLEAGUES THAT FOR ANY POLICY, ANY ORDINANCE THAT WE CAN GO FORWARD WITH, THERE CAN ALWAYS BE HYPOTHETICALS OR CONCERNS ABOUT LACK OF ENFORCEMENT, BUT IF WE ARE WORRIED ABOUT THAT, WE WOULDN'T HAVE SPEED LIMITS OR WE WOULDN'T HAVE, YOU KNOW, REQUIREMENTS THAT PEOPLE HAVE SMOKE DETECTORS IN THEIR HOMES. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT AND IT'S WHY WE ARE HERE TO MAKE ORDINANCES THAT MAKE OUR COMMUNITY A MEMBER PLACE FOR OUR RESIDENTS TO LIVE AND JUST LOOKING FORWARD TO THE PROCESS AND I WILL GET SOME QUESTIONS TO STAFF. THANKS.
02:09:52.751: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. ROLL CALL VOTE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER SMITH.
02:09:58.524: >> Councilmember Smith: YES.
02:10:00.292: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES.
02:10:03.362: >> Councilmember Hayner:  NO.
02:10:03.963: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES.
02:10:05.965: >> Councilmember Griswold: NO.
02:10:09.568: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES.
02:10:10.269: >> Councilmember Grand: YES.
02:10:10.870: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES.
02:10:12.705: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
02:10:13.205: >> Councilmember Eaton: YES.
02:10:13.806: >> Councilmember Nelson:  YES.
02:10:15.007: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION CARRIES.
02:10:16.408: >> Mayor Taylor: LET'S TAKE A SHORT BREAK. [ BREAK ]
02:22:24.301: >> Mayor Taylor: WE ARE BACK AFTER A SHORT BREAK, CA-19, RESOLUTION TO APPROVE THE EXTENSION OF TEMPORARY EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT BETWEEN ABIGAIL ELIAS AND THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. $25,000. MOVED BY HAYNER AND SECONDED BY GRISWOLD. DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
02:22:41.453: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I JUST WANT TO APOLOGIZE, BECAUSE I MADE AN ASSUMPTION AND MADE SYMPATHY STATEMENTS LAST NIGHT THAT THIS WAS ACTUALLY AN EXTENSION OF OUR LEGAL FEES FOR THE 1, 4 DIOXANE CASE, AND THAT IS NOT TRUE. THIS IS ACTUALLY $30,000 THAT'S GOING TO BE FUNDED THROUGH PUBLIC SERVICES, AND IT'S FOR WORK IN THAT AREA WITH A SMALL AMOUNT OF WORK BEING DONE, REGARDING THE DIOXANE PLUME.
02:23:16.755: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
02:23:20.058: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YEAH THANK YOU, BECAUSE I HAD THE SAME CONSIDERATION UNTIL WE READ THE REST OF THE INFORMATION, AND MS. ELIAS HAS DONE A FINE JOB HERE AND I'M SURE IT'S PERFECTLY FINE TO KEEP HER ON A LITTLE BIT MORE. SORRY SHE HAD TO RETIRE. RIGHT IN THE THROES OF GELMAN, OFF SHE GOES. WE HAVE 11 PEOPLE OVER THERE, MR. POSTEMA? THERE'S LIKE 11 ATTORNEYS AND SHE'S -- THIS IS A VERY SPECIFIC THINGS THAT SHE'S BEEN KIND OF CONCLUDE THESE PROJECTS, IS THAT WHAT IT IS?
02:23:51.356: >> City Atty. Postema: YES, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS. THIS HAS BEEN CONSULTATION WITH CRAIG HUPY AND JUST THIS PROCESS IS VERY TECHNICAL AND SO IT'S A WRAP-UP AND YOU HAVE ENTRUSTED ME WITH THESE TRANSITIONS AND, YEAH, YOU DON'T WANT EVERYTHING GRINDING TO A HALT RIGHT NOW.
02:24:13.044: >> Councilmember Hayner:  ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM AND THAN GRISWOLD.
02:24:18.349: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU. I FULLY SUPPORT THIS EXTENSION. THE ORIGINAL AGREEMENT WAS FOR $25,000, AND IT WAS INTENDED TO COVER THE PERIOD FROM JULY JULY 1st, 2019, THROUGH NOVEMBER 1st, MS. ELIAS' REPLACEMENT WAS HIRED ON SEPTEMBER 9th. HONESTLY, I WASN'T QUITE SURE WHY THE LONG OVERLAP WAS NECESSARY, BUT GIVEN THAT MS. ELIAS IS WORKING ON GELMAN MATTERS, THAT OBVIOUSLY EXPLAINS PART OF THE ISSUE. AS YOU KNOW, I WASN'T SURE WHY PUBLIC SERVICES WAS -- THE BUDGET WAS PAYING FOR THIS. I APPRECIATE THE RESPONSE TO MY QUESTION ABOUT THAT. AND SO CLEARLY, IT'S NOT -- IT DOESN'T SEEM TO ME LIKE IT'S A, YOU KNOW, OVERLAP OR TRANSFER OF KNOWLEDGE ISSUE BUT IT'S MORE LIKELY DRIVEN BY THE COMFORT LEVEL OF HAVING, YOU KNOW, AN EXTRA PERSON AROUND. NO QUESTION MS. ELIAS BRINGS ENORMOUS EXPERIENCE. I WILL JUST SAY AS WITH ALL GOOD THINGS, I DO THINK WE HAVE TO BREAK LOOSE SOONER OR LATER. I WILL JUST --
02:25:31.823: >> City Atty. Postema: OH, I AGREE WITH THAT.
02:25:33.658: >> Councilmember Lumm: OKAY. THANKS.
02:25:35.593: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? I'M SORRY. MY APOLOGIES. COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
02:25:42.367: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WANT TO ADD THAT I DID TALK TO ABIGAIL TODAY AND I LEARNED SOME MORE INFORMATION. I'M MOST APPRECIATIVE OF HER. SO THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH HER PERFORMANCE AND, IN FACT, IT'S A REALLY VERY ECONOMICAL OPTION BECAUSE INSTEAD OF PAYING THE GOING RATE FOR A LAWYER, WHICH IS 200 PLUS, BECAUSE SHE'S RETIRED FROM THE CITY AND HAS RETURNED, WE CAN ONLY PAY HER $66 AN HOUR. SO IN A WAY WE PROBABLY WOULD LIKE TO KEEP HER FOREVER BUT -- BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO AND SHE DOESN'T WANT TO STAY.
02:26:20.638: >> City Atty. Postema: SHE NEEDS TO RETIRE.
02:26:22.807: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES.
02:26:26.811: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. CA-20 RESOLUTION TO AMEND THE FISCAL YEAR 20 GENERAL FUND BUDGET BY ADDING ONE FULL-TIME EQUIVALENT POSITION AND RELATED FUNDING TO THE ANN ARBOR POLICE DEPARTMENT. MOVED BY LUMM AND SECONDED BY ACKERMAN. DISCUSSION OF CA-20 COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
02:26:47.532: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I SEE CHIEF COX AND DEPUTY CHIEF ARE HERE. THIS RESOLUTION TO ADD AN FTE TO THE POLICE BUDGET IS SIMILAR IN MY MIND TO CA-17, WHICH WAS THE RESOLUTION ADDING AN FTE TO THE HOUSING COMMISSION. IT REPRESENTS ONE OF THE FEW EXAMPLES WHERE THE SITUATION IS SUCH THAT MID-YEAR BUDGET AMENDMENT IS APPROPRIATE. A VALID, APPROPRIATE, EXCEPTION TO THE GENERAL RULE -- THE GENERAL RULE THAT I APPLY THAT MID-YEAR BUDGET CHANGES ARE POOR PROCESS AND SHOULD NOT BE APPROVED. LIKE THE HOUSING COMMISSION, FTE, THERE'S A SPECIFIC NEW WORKLOAD HERE THAT IF NOT DONE PROPERLY, AND EXPEDITIOUSLY. WE HAVE HEARD FROM CHIEF COX, FROM PLA LAZARUS AND FROM THE INDEPENDENT CITIZEN POLICE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION, COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI AND I SERVE ON THAT COMMISSION AS THE COUNCIL LIAISON. THERE'S A BACKLOG OF DATA AND INFORMATION REQUESTS THAT ARE NOT BEING MET NOW, AND CAN BE MET ONLY WITH AN OFFICER. A PRIMARY PURPOSE OF THIS AUDIT AND REVIEW, LIEUTENANT POSITION IS TO ADDRESS THAT PROBLEM. AS A COUNCIL, WE HAVE COMMITTED TO DO WHAT IT TAKES TO HELP ICPAC TO BE SUCCESSFUL. IT COULD RESULT IN SLOWING THE COMMISSION'S MOMENTUM. THAT'S AN ADVERSE OUTCOME AND WE SHOULD DO WHAT WE CAN TO AVOID EVEN APPROVING A MID-YEAR BUDGET AMENDMENT. THE ADMINISTRATOR HAS INDICATED THAT TWO MORE POLICE FTEs WILL LIKELY COME TO COUNCIL YET THIS FISCAL YEAR, AS FISCAL YEAR '20 BUDGET AMENDMENTS. A DATAL ANALYST AND A COMMUNICATION OFFICERS POSITION. AS MUCH AS I SUPPORT THAT MISSION AND REINVIGORATE COMMUNITY POLICING IN NASH, I LIKELY WILL NOT SUPPORT THOSE AS MID-YEAR BUDGET AMENDMENTS. IN MY MIND, THOSE ADDITIONAL -- ADMINISTRATIVE ADDITIONS DO NOT MEET THE SAME THRESHOLD. ADDRESSING AN IMMEDIATE SPECIFIC NEED THAT IF NOT ADDRESSED HAS SPECIFIC IDENTIFY PHIABLE ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES THAT WANT AN EXCEPTION TO MY GENERAL RULE OF NO MID-YEAR OUT-OF-PROCESS BUDGET AMENDMENTS. NO ONE WANTS TO RESTORE STAFFING IN THE AAPD MORE THAN I DO. I PROPOSED ADDING STAFFING IN EVERY BUDGET DELIBERATIONS SINCE I HAVE BEEN BACK ON COUNCIL. BUT EXCEPT IN UNUSUAL SITUATIONS, THE TIME FOR THAT IS DURING BUDGET DISCUSSIONS AND WHEN THE BUDGET IS ADOPTED, NOT MID-YEAR. SO I WILL SUPPORT THIS AMENDMENT TONIGHT, BUT LIKELY NOT THE ONE YET TO COME. ONE CONCERN I DID HAVE WITH THIS RESOLUTION INITIALLY IS THE FUNDING SOURCE. REDUCING THE PROVISION IN THE BUDGET FOR THE FIRE STATION MASTER PLAN. THE RESPONSES TO MY QUESTIONS HAVE ALLAYED THAT CONCERN, HOWEVER, AS APPARENTLY WE RECEIVED MORE REVENUE FROM THE STATE FIRE PROTECTION GRANT PROGRAM THAN WE HAD ANTICIPATED IN THE BUDGET. THAT'S VERY GOOD NEWS, AND BECAUSE AS IT SEEMED AT THE BUDGET RETREAT LAST MONTH, THAT WE WERE MAKING REAL PROGRESS AND PUTTING MEAT ON THE BONES OF THE FIRE STATION MASTER PLAN, AND I CERTAINLY WOULD NOT WANT TO DO ANYTHING TO SET THAT INITIATIVE BACK. SO THANK YOU FOR LISTENING.
02:30:15.540: >> Mayor Taylor: I REALIZE I SHOULD HAVE CANNED OUR STANDING CITY ADMINISTRATOR TO MAKE REFERENCE. WE HAVE BEFORE US AN AMENDED -- OR AN AMENDED RESOLUTION RATHER THAN ONE WHICH WAS INITIALLY BEFORE US. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE PRIMARY DIFFERENCE, THE LEAD DIFFERENCE IS THAT THE PRIOR REQUEST WAS FOR $100,000. THE REQUEST BEFORE US IS FOR $75,000. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
02:30:38.429: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, MAYOR TAYLOR AND, WELL, THAT'S GOOD NEWS!
02:30:42.934: >> Councilmember Lumm: THAT IS GOOD NEWS.
02:30:44.335: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I WILL HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FOR OUR POLICE CHIEF. THANKS FOR BEING HERE, AS WELL AS THE DEPUTY POLICE CHIEF AS WITH COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, I AM THE LIAISON TO THE INDEPENDENT POLICE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION. AND WE HAVE HAD MANY MEETINGS AND GROWING PAINS DURING THOSE MEETINGS TRYING TO FIND OUR WAY TO THE BEST PRACTICES AND WE'RE FACING SOME ISSUES WITH DELAYS IN GETTING INFORMATION BACK TO THE COMMISSION, THAT HAS BEEN ASKED. INFORMATION THAT CAN ONLY BE APPARENTLY REDACTED AND IF YOU CAN HELP ME EXPLAIN THAT PROCESS, POLICE CHIEF AND WOULD IS ALLOWED AND WOULD IS NOT? BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF MISCONCEPTION, UNFORTUNATELY IN THE COMMUNITY AS TO THE ABILITIES OF COMMISSION TO LOOK AT DOCUMENTS AND WO WHO GETS TH- IF YOU CAN EXPLAIN THAT. AND INITION TO THAT,  -- AND IN ADDITION TO THAT, THE ROLE OF THIS NEW POSITION, HELP US EXPLAIN AGAIN WHERE YOU THINK IT WILL FIT IN.
02:32:01.913: >> SURE. SO I WILL START OFF BY, FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME COME BEFORE YOU TODAY. I WANT TO START OFF BY EXPLAINING WHAT THIS AUDIT REVIEW POSITION IS REALLY FOR. IT IS A QUALITY ASSURANCE, INTERNAL POSITION TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING THAT WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING, WE ARE DOING IT. WE HAVE AN INT INTERNAL AFFAIRS FUNCTION THAT INVESTIGATES ALLEGATIONS OF POLICE ABUSE AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE, BUT AUDIT REVIEW LOOKS AT ALL PLACES IN THE DEPARTMENT, WHETHER IT'S PROPERTY, FINANCE, OUR DAY-TO-DAY ACTIVITIES, VIDEO FOOTAGE, TO PRO PROACTIVELY GO THROUGH. IT'S ONE THING TO SAY THAT YOU ARE GOOD AND IT'S ANOTHER THING TO HAVE DATA TO SHOW THAT YOU ARE GOOD. IT'S A POSITION THAT DOESN'T CURRENTLY EXIST. IF YOU HAVE STRONG INTERNAL CONTROLS, THIS IS THE KIND OF POSITION YOU NEED TO DO THAT. AND SO, YOU KNOW, IT STRUCK ME AS A CERTAIN NEED AS SOON AS I GOT HERE AND THAT'S SOMETHING I DEFINITELY THINK WE SHOULD ALWAYS HAVE, A STRONG INTERNAL CONTROLS, AS FAR AS WHAT YOU ARE DOING AND HOW YOU ARE DOING IT AND THE ONLY WAY TO DO IT IS TO MEASURE IT AND ACTUALLY GO OUT AND D DO THE WORK AND THAT'S THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF THIS. BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT PART OF THIS POSITION, YOU LOOK AT VIDEO, WE PROACTIVELY LOOK AT SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS, IT DOES CROSS OVER WITH IPAC IS ACTUALLY ASKING FOR SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THEY ARE LOOKING FOR. SO WE CAN CERTAINLY INITIALLY START OFF BY HAVING THAT PERSON START OFF BY HAVING US GO THROUGH THAT BACKLOG AND WE ARE ABLE TO GET SOME OF THE INFORMATION THAT THEY ARE ASKING FOR US. YOU KNOW, OUT. BECAUSE THE REALITY IS WE HAVE AN INTERNAL AFFAIRS POSITION OF ONE PERSON. AND IT'S HARD FOR THAT ONE PERSON TO BOTH LOOK AT THE CASES THAT COME IN, STOP WHAT THEY ARE DOING, AND THEN GO AND GIVE INFORMATION TO IPAC WHEN IT'S ONLY ONE PERSON. THEIR PRIMARY TUTSI TO INVESTIGATE THE ALLEGATIONS OF MISCONDUCT THAT COME THROUGH. THAT'S THEIR PRIMARY PURPOSE TO MAKE SURE THAT HAPPENS. YOU CAN'T, YOU KNOW, STOP THAT PROCESS TO DO SOMETHING ELSE. SO WE NEED ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL TO HELP ADDRESS SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THEY HAVE BEEN ASKING FOR. AND THIS POSITION WILL HELP ALLEVIATE SOME OF THE PRESSURE THAT IS OUT THERE. YOU ASKED ABOUT THE REDACTIONS AND THE LEAN PROCESS. WE DON'T CONTROL THE LEAN PROCESS. THE STATE POLICE DOES THAT. AND BASICALLY, LEAN IS TO SUM IT UP, THE STATE HAS A DATABASE, REALLY, WHICH IS RUN BY THE FBI AND IT H ALL THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE INFORMATION THAT MOST PEOPLE -- WELL, LAW ENFORCEMENT SHARES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AND SO THERE'S USUALLY A CRITERIA AROUND THAT. WHO CAN HAVE ACCESS TO THAT INFORMATION AND SO THE STATE POLICE HAVE A CRITERIA FOR WHO CAN HAVE ACCESS TO THAT. AND FRANKLY, YOU KNOW, MANY MEMBERS OF IPAC OR, YOU KNOW, WERE DENIED ACCESS THROUGH STATE POLICE, WHICH WE DON'T OWN TO HAVE ACCESS TO THAT INFORMATION. AND SO WE HAVE TO PERSONALLY GO THROUGH AND REDACT WHAT OUR INDIVIDUALS REMEMBER TO GET THEM THIS INFORMATION. WE HAVE A TON OF VIDEO FOOTAGE, FROM ALL OFFICERS WHEN THEY GO OUT, THEY HAVE BODY CAMERAS. IT TAKES, GOSH -- IT -- FOR EVERY -- FOR EVERY HOUR OF VIDEO, IT TAKES THREE TO FOUR HOURS TO REDACT THE INFORMATION TO GET IT OUT THERE. THERE'S A LOT OF MANPOWER INVOLVED WITH JUST PULLING THE INFORMATION. NEVER MIND THE OTHER INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE TO PUT OUT THERE, WHETHER IT'S FOIA REQUESTS AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE. IPAC, I'M ALL FOR IT, AND IT'S TREMENDOUS THAT IT'S HERE BUT THE REALITY IS WE DON'T HAVE POSITIONS TO DO SOME OF THESE FUNCTIONS THAT WE'RE BEING ASKED TO DO, AND THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF THE PEOPLE WOULD WORK THERE, AS A MANAGER, THEY HAVE TO INVESTIGATE THE ALLEGATIONS OF MISCONDUCT. THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE HERE FOR. WE CAN'T SPLIT THEIR DUTIES TO SAY STOP DOING THAT TO DO THIS OTHER THING AND THAT'S WHY THE IMPORTANCE OF THE AUDIT AND REVIEW, AS WELL AS DO THE OTHER THINGS I TALKED ABOUT TO RELIEVE THE PRESSURE OF GETTING THAT INFORMATION OUT FOR IPAC, YOU KNOW SO, WE CAN LIVE UP TO THE AGREEMENT THAT THE CITY SIGNED US UP FOR. WAS THAT HELPFUL?
02:36:35.786: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: MORE THAN HELPFUL. I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME, IN EXPLAINING IT. I JUST WOULD LIKE TO HAVE IT ON THE RECORD. OBVIOUSLY WE HAD CONVERSATIONS AND I HAVE HEARD IT FROM YOU BEFORE, BUT IT'S HELPFUL THAT -- TO HAVE IT OUT THERE FOR THE PUBLIC TO HEAR, FOR MY COLLEAGUES TO HEAR BECAUSE THERE'S SOME MISUNDERSTANDING AS TO THE PROCESS AND WHO HAS ACCESS TO THESE VITAL INFORMATION AND THE CONFIDENTIALITY SURROUNDING IT ALL. I DO APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORTS COMING INTO OUR COMMUNITY, EVALUATING THE ORGANIZATION THAT YOU ARE AHEAD OF, AND TRYING TO MAKE IT A MORE EFFECTIVE FORCE. AND I REMEMBER YOU SAYING EARLY ON, IT'S NOT JUST ADDING UNIFORMED POLICE OFFICERS, BUT HAVING A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE THE SHORTCOMINGS ARE, SO WE CAN BETTER USE THE ONES WE HAVE AND I FEEL THAT THAT'S THE SPIRIT OF THE INITIATIVE HERE, IS TO HAVE A POSITION FILLED SO THAT THE REST OF THE FORCE IS -- CAN DO THEIR JOB WITH BETTER EFFECTIVENESS SO IT'S NOT JUST ADDING ONE. IT HAS A MULTIPLYING EFFECT AND HOPEFULLY IT'S MORE THAN ONE OFFICER, AND THERE'S A MULTIPLIER EFFECT BECAUSE THOSE OFFICERS THAT ARE THERE ARE GOING TO HAVE BETTER INFORMATION TO DO THEIR JOB WITH. SO I APPRECIATE THAT. THAT HIGH LEVEL THINKING ON THIS AND THE FACT THAT WE ARE ADDING MORE POLICE. IT'S MORE THAN JUST ADDING POLICE TO THE FORCE. IT'S MAKING THEM MORE EFFECTIVE FOR THE ONES THAT WE HAVE. YES, I AGREE WHOLEHEARTEDLY AND WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THIS.
02:38:35.539: >> IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT ADDING MORE. IT'S MAKING SURE YOU HAVE THE RIGHT KIND AND MAKING SURE THAT YOU ARE MEASURING AND MAKING SURE THAT THE QUALITY OF THE OFFICERS IS AS HIGH AS IT CAN BE. AND THAT COMES FROM BASICALLY DOING AUDITS AND MAKING SURE YOU SPOT CHECK AND DO ALL THE THINGS NECESSARY TO MAKE SURE THAT NOT ONLY DO WE SAY THAT WE ARE GOOD, BUT THAT WE ACTUALLY ARE GOOD. ALONG THE WAY, WE WILL FIND THINGS LIKE ANY OTHER PLACE WHO DOES QUALITY ASSURANCE TEST AND THEN WE ADDRESS THOSE AND FIX THOSE TO MAKE THE QUALIT BETTER. THAT'S THE GO ELF IT. THAT'S HOW YOU RUN A WELL-RUN POLICE DEPARTMENT IN MANY I POSITION.
02:39:13.444: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER EATON AND THEN HAYNER.
02:39:15.646: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I HAVE ONE LAST THING. IT'S NOT A QUESTION. IT'S TIME FOR ME TO GET A LITTLE POLITICAL. I WILL SUPPORT THIS, OF COURSE, IN THE MID-YEAR BUDGET AMENDMENT. I DO THINK IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT WE GET IPAC THE INFORMATION IT'S ASKING FOR WITHOUT DELAY AND MAKE YOUR FORCE A BETTER FORCE BUT IT'S THE FUNDING SOURCE THAT I HAVE AN ISSUE WITH. AND I REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A M PLACE WHERE WE SHOUD USE THE COUNTY HEALTH MILLAGE, AND FOR THE YEARS COMMENT TO THIS. I THINK THE FUNDING SOURCE THIS YEAR IS A STOPGAP MEASURE. WE FOUND SOME MONEY FROM SOME OTHER UNUSED SOURCE AND WE APPLIED IT HERE. IF WE ARE GOING TO FUND THIS POSITION FOR DECADES TO COME, WE HAVE TO FIND A BETTER RECURRING SOURCE OF REVENUE. WE HAVE SEVEN YEARS LEFT ON THE MENTAL HEALTH MILLAGE AND THIS WOULD BE NO MORE JUSTIFIABLE WAY OF SPENDING THAT TAX DOLLAR THAN TO PAY FOR A POSITION LIKE THIS. SO, AGAIN, I WILL CONSTANTLY BEAT THAT DRUM AS LONG AS I'M ON THIS COUNSEL TILL. -- COUNCIL.
02:40:27.651: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
02:40:28.485: >> Councilmember Eaton: I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE GOOD JOB YOU ARE DOING. I WANT TO REITERATE WHAT COUNCILMEMBER LUMM SAID. I'M HESITANT TO ADD NEW POSITIONS MID-YEAR. HAD YOU BEEN HERE LAST YEAR, WHEN WE WERE DESIGNING THIS YEAR'S BUDGET, I WOULD HAVE EXPECTHAT YOU WOULD HAVE ASKED FOR THESE POSITIONS IN A TIMELY MANNER. I WILL SUPPORT THIS BECAUSE WE HAVE GIVEN YOU A TASK, AND THIS IS WHAT YOU TOLD US YOU NEED TO ACCOMPLISH THE TASK WE HAVE GIVEN YOU. I'M REALLY IMPRESSED WITH THE JOB YOU ARE DOING ALREADY AND YOU CAN EXPECT MY SUPPORT NOT ONLY ON THIS POSITION BUT ON THE TWO THAT ARE FORTHCOMING. I REALLY APPRECIATE THE GOOD WORK YOU ARE DOING, YOUR WILLINGNESS TO MEET WITH US ON A REGULAR BASIS TO EXPLAIN WHAT YOU ARE DOING AND THANKS.
02:41:12.329: >> THANK YOU.
02:41:13.597: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
02:41:14.465: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I GUESS THE QUESTIONS CONTINUE. THIS IS A FULL-TIME POSITION; IS THAT CORRECT?
02:41:19.169: >> YES.
02:41:19.436: >> Councilmember Hayner: MOVING FORWARD, AND THIS IS A FULL-TIME POSITION IN PERPETUITY, YOU MIGHT SAY. I SAW WE DID SOME CALCULATIONS. THIS YEAR $75,000, AND NEXT YEAR $250,000? NO?
02:41:32.983: >> 205 FOR THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR.
02:41:35.385: >> Councilmember Hayner:  OH, 205, A LITTLE DYSLEXIA HERE. SO WE APPROVED TWO OTHER SWORN OFFICER POSITIONS, DOES WE NOT IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. SO I GUESS I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THESE GET -- HOW THESE ROLES GET FILLED. I KNOW WE HAVE TROUBLE FINDING SWORN OFFICERS. SO WHY AREN'T WE JUST USING ONE OF THOSE APPROVED POSITIONS? BECAUSE OF WHERE THE FUNDING IS COMING FROM?
02:42:05.682: >> SO THIS IS THE THIRD, IF I MAY. THE TWO POSITIONS ADDED TO THE BUDGET WERE POLICE OFFICERS, WHO ARE ON THE GROUND, MUCH LIKE OFFICER KELLER HERE TONIGHT. OUR RECRUITING STAFF IN HUMAN RESOURCES AND ALSO THE COMMAND STAFF AND THE POLICE DEPARTMENT HAVE BEEN WORKING DILIGENTLY TO FILL THOSE VACANCIES AND VACANCIES THAT COME UP AS A RESULT OF RETIREMENT AND TRANSFERS OR WHATEVER. THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THE YEAR, THE VACAN VACANCIES EBB AW AS PEOPLE TRANSITION IN AND OUT OF THE POLICE DEPARTMENT. RIGHT NOW THERE ARE THREE VACANCIES AND THREE OFFERS OUT FOR THEM TO BE FILLED. SO WE ARE AT CAPACITY. THOSE POSITIONS HAVE BEEN FILLED. THIS POSITION IS A POLICE LIEUTENANT IN COMMAND STAFF WHO IS A SWORN OFFICER, WHO WILL, YOU KNOW, NOT BE ENGAGING IN PATROL ACTIVITY, BUT WILL BE WORKING WITH COMMAND STAFF TO FULFILL THE AUDIT AND REVIEW FUNCTIONS THAT THE CHIEF REQUIRES. IT WAS ASKED WHY THE CHANGING TO $75,000. IT'S A MATTER OF TIMING. THE BUDGET STAFF LOOKED AT WHEN COULD THIS POSITION BE REASONABLY FILLED AND HOW MUCH OF THAT SALARY TIME IS LEFT IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND IT WAS DETERMINED THAT $100,000 IS JUST A LITTLE SHY OF SIX MONTHS OF SALARY FUNDING, WHICH WE HAVE ALREADY ECLIPSED THE SIX MONTH PERIOD AND TIME LEFT IN THIS FISCAL YEAR. ASSUMING BUDGETARY APPROVAL AND THE CONTRACTUALLY REQUIRED POSTING PROCESS AND THE RECRUITMENT PROCESS, THE FEELING FROM THE BUDGET OFFICE WAS THAT $75,000 WOULD BE ENOUGH TO SATISFY THE SALARY REQUIREMENTS FOR THIS YEAR.
02:43:53.824: >> Councilmember Hayner:  SO THE CONCERNS OVER TIMELINESS IS ASKED TO THE BACKLOG OF REQUESTS FROM THE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION BUT THE ONGOING USE IS GOING TO BE VARIOUS INTERNAL FUNCTIONS THAT YOU SPELLED OUT QUITE CLEARLY IN YOUR MEETINGS, LIKE WHEN ANN AND I MET ABOUT YOU.
02:44:11.909: >> IPAC DID NOT EXIST, I WOULD BE ASKING FOR THIS POSITION BECAUSE IT'S AN IMPORTANT POSITION TO MEASURE, YOU KNOW, HOW WELL YOU ARE DOING WHAT YOU ARE DOING. IT JUST SO HAPPENS A LOT OF THINGS THAT THEY WILL BE LOOKING AT, IT JUST SO HAPPENS THAT IPAC IS ASKING FOR THAT MATERIAL AND WE DON'T HAVE ANYONE TO DO THAT. SO IT'S A CROSSOVER. AND SO, YOU KNOW, YOU GET THE BENEFIT OF THIS POSITION, AS FAR AS, YOU KNOW, RELIEVING THE BURDEN THAT WE ARE HAVING RIGHT NOW, JUST TRYING TO GET THE WORK DONE.
02:44:37.868: >> Councilmember Hayner:  THIS IS HYPOTHETICAL. DO YOU SUPPOSE OUR 1 1400 SHORT-TERM RENTALS GENERATE MORE THAN THE 30,000 LONG-TERM RENTALS. I JOKED BECA BECAUSE I EMAILED E WILL GET THAT INFORMATION FOR ME.
02:45:00.090: >> THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT.
02:45:02.459: >> Councilmember Hayner:  FEEL FREE TO ANSWER.
02:45:06.063: >> WITH MORE DATA. HOW ABOUT THAT.
02:45:12.035: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
02:45:12.903: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS. SO THE STATE GOVERNS THE -- WHO CAN ACCESS LEAN.
02:45:19.209: >> YES.
02:45:19.476: >> Councilmember Nelson:  DO YOU -- EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT YOUR PURVIEW, I'M CURIOUS, WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT HOW STATE SETS ITS ITEMS --
02:45:31.054: >> THEY DO HAVE A CRITERIA.
02:45:32.556: >> Councilmember Nelson: OKAY.
02:45:34.257: >> AND, YOU KNOW, I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK FOR ANOTHER ENTITY. YOU KNOW, BUT, YOU KNOW, I COULD, YOU KNOW, GET THE INFORMATION AND MAYBE FORWARD TO YOU THE CRITERIA THAT, YOU KNOW, THEY HAVE SENT TO US, AS FAR AS WHAT REASONS THEY HAVE. BECAUSE THEY CONTROL THAT. AND BASICALLY, I THINK PART OF THE CRITERIA IS REALLY, LIKE, YOU KNOW, WHAT IS YOUR FULL-TIME POSITION? WHERE DO YOU CURRENTLY WORK? I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO IT WITHOUT, YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY LOOKING AT THE CRITERIA, BUT USUALLY YOU HAVE TO HAVE A NEXUS OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE OR LAW ENFORCEMENT OR SOME NEXUS TO REALLY THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND THE PURPOSE FOR LOOKING AT THAT MATERIAL, OR HAVING ACCESS TO THAT MATERIAL. YOU KNOW, FOR A FULL-TIME BASIS, I THINK, YOU KNOW TO SUMMARIZE SOME OF THE THINGS.
02:46:19.970: >> GENERALLY SPEAKING, I CAN ADD ON TO THAT. THE REQUIREMENTS THAT THE STATE HAS, SAY, THAT YOU HAVE TO BE A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL WITH THE POWER TO ARREST SOMEBODY OR ENGAGED IN LIKE A COALITION OF REGIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT PROFESSIONALS WHO WORK IN SOME PUBLIC SAFETY CAPACITY. THE RULES ARE RESTRICTIVE. WE CAN PROVIDE THE SPECIFIC GUIDE LINES.
02:46:46.730: >> Councilmember Nelson:  THAT WAS THE BALLPARK I WAS GUESSING AT. I ASSUMED SOMETHING LIKE THAT BECAUSE CLEARLY, ICPAC PORTION WOULD WANT ACCESS TO THAT INFORMATION BUT A STANDARD THAT YOU HAVE TO WORK IN LAW ENFORCEMENT WOULD DISQUALIFY VOLUNTEER MEMBERS OF THE COMMISSION. THERE'S A LOGIC TO THAT, I GUESS. I GUESS MY OTHER QUESTION WAS, SO YOU WERE SAYING THAT THIS INTERNAL AFFAIRS POSITION IS KIND OF OVERLAPPING WITH SOME OF THE NEEDS OF ICPAC AND MY CURIOSITY WAS WOULD THAT PERSON -- IF NOT FOR THE NEEDS OF ICPAC, WOULD THAT PERSON NEED TO DO ALL OF THAT REDACTING? WOULD ALL OF THAT REDACTING BE --
02:47:32.476: >> NO. UH-UH.
02:47:33.844: >> Councilmember Nelson:  SO IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE OVERLAP.
02:47:38.014: >> NO, LOOKING AT BODY CAMERA FOOTAGE, SOME OF THE THINGS WE ARE DOING AS A RESULT OF ICPAC'S INQUIRY, THEY WOULD BE DOING IT ANYWAY. THE REDACTION IS NOT SOMETHING THAT THEY WOULD DO, BUT THE FACT IS -- THE OVERLAP IS THE VIDEO ITSELF AND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THEY ARE LOOKING AT IN THAT COMPLIANCE, BUT THE ACTUAL REDACTION PROBABLY WOULDN'T -- YOU KNOW, WOULDN'T BE A PART OF THAT NORMAL DAY-TO-DAY ACTIVITY. BUT FOR THESE PURPOSES, WE DON'T HAVE ANYONE TO DO IT, BUT THE EXTRA POSITION, YOU KNOW, WE WOULD CERTAINLY BASICALLY GIVE A SPECIAL ASSIGNMENT TO DO THAT UNTIL WE CAN ADDRESS SOME OF THESE DEFICITS THAT WE HAVE.
02:48:18.522: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I GUESS MY LAST QUESTION AND THIS IS GOING TO TELEGRAPH HOW PERHAPS LITTLE I KNOW ON THE SUBJECT. WHAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF HOW A VIDEO MIGHT NEED TO BE REDACTED FOR THE PURPOSES OF --
02:48:31.735: >> SURE. SURE. SO THE OFFICERS WEAR BODY CAMERAS AND WE GO INTO PEOPLE'S HOMES. WHEN YOU GO INTO A PERSON'S HOME, WE WOULD REDACT IF THEY HAVE KIDS, OR, YOU KNOW, THINGS IN THE BACKGROUND, THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO BLUR OUT AND REDACT, YOU KNOW? THINGS OF THAT NATURE, AS WELL AS, YOU KNOW, IN THE STREETS. YOU KNOW, THERE'S FOOTAGE OF STUFF OUT THERE, WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING, THEIR NAMES, WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION, WE JUST CAN'T RELEASE FOOTAGE OF OTHER PEOPLE.
02:49:02.933: >> Councilmember Nelson:  EVEN IN A PUBLIC SPACE, LIKE A STREET? I MEAN, IF I'M OUT IN A PUBLIC STREET, DO I HAVE AN EXPECTATION OF PRIVACY?
02:49:12.943: >> SO WE'RE VIDEOTAPING, BUT NOW WE ARE DISTRIBUTING, YOU KNOW, THAT INFORMATION. SO THE ISSUE IS, WE DON'T HAVE AUTHORIZATION TO PUBLICIZE, YOU KNOW, SOMEONE ELSE -- A BYSTANDER, YOU KNOW, VIDEO WITHOUT THEIR ORGANIZATION.
02:49:31.428: >> Councilmember Nelson:  SO ICPAC'S -- GIVING VIDEO TO ICPAC IS CONSIDERED DISTRIBUTION.
02:49:50.413: >> LEAN. IT'S POLICE REPORTS, IT'S NOT JUST VIDEO. IT'S ANYTHING THAT GOES THROUGH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE DATABASE. IF YOU ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO USE IT, THEN THE FACT THAT WE GIVE IT TO SOMEONE ELSE IS -- WE'RE VIOLATING THE LAW BY DISTRIBUTING LEAN INFORMATION TO OUTSIDERS, WHICH MEANS WE WOULD BE IN VIOLATION OF THAT, AND COULD POTENTIALLY LOSE OUR ABILITY TO HAVE, YOU KNOW, THAT DATABASE, WHICH WOULD BE, YOU KNOW, UNHEARD OF FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY TO OPERATE WITHOUT THAT INFORMATION.
02:50:17.107: >> Councilmember Nelson:  SO DOES EVERY PIECE OF EVIDENCE THAT YOUR DEPARTMENT COLLECTS IN ANY INVESTIGATION, DOES IT AUTOMATICALLY BECOME PART OF THE LEAN DATABASE? IS THAT --
02:50:27.550: >> WELL, IT DEPENDS ON WHERE IT CAME FROM.
02:50:30.186: >> Councilmember Nelson: WELL, INTERNALLY WITHIN YOUR DEPARTMENT. LIKE -- OKAY SO HERE'S MY HYPOTHETICAL.
02:50:37.994: >> NOW I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED.
02:50:39.829: >> Councilmember Nelson:  YOU HAVE BODY CAMERA FOOTAGE OUT ON THE STREET IN A PUBLIC PLACE, NOT IN SOMEBODY'S PRIVATE HOME. ONE OF YOUR OFFICERS TOOK IT. IT'S, YOU KNOW -- AN INCIDENT HAPPENED AND ICPAC HAS QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT INCIDENT, DOES THAT FOOTAGE -- IS THAT SOMEHOW PART OF LEAN AND THAT REQUIRES REDACTION?
02:50:59.115: >> WE DON'T HAVE TO REDACT EVERYTHING, BUT THE FACT IS THAT IF WE WERE HAVING CONTACT WITH A PERSON AND IT'S THERE'S A POLICE OFFICER THERE AND THEY HAVE RAN THE PERSON FOR A WARRANT CHECK OR SOMETHING OF THAT NATURE AND THE INFORMATION ON HIS VIDEO BLBLARES OUT, THAT'S LEAN INFORMATION. WE WOULD HAVE TO BLUR OUT THAT INFORMATION BECAUSE IT'S THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION WHETHER THEY HAVE A LICENSE, WHETHER THEY HAVE A WARRANT, AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE. AND SO THAT'S INFORMATION THAT WE COULDN'T DISSEMINATE. YOU KNOW, THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS, A LICENSE. IF THEY HAVE A LICENSE ON THEIR HAND AND THE VIDEO CAPTURES A PICTURE OF THEIR LICENSE: THAT'S LEAN INFORMATION. THERE'S A LOT OF PIECES OF INFORMATION THAT GO THROUGH THAT ATLANTA SYSTEM. AND IT REALLY TAKES A LOT OF TIME BECAUSE WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW.
02:52:00.110: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I DON'T WANT TO TAKE ANY MORE TIME I REALIZE WE HAVE ICPAC AND THE COUNCIL LIAISON SHOULD BE ASKING THESE QUESTIONS. I JUST SORT OF WANTS TO PROJECT SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT I'M HEARING FROM PEOPLE LIKE THE IDEAS ABOUT HOW CAN WE MAKE THINGS MORE TRANSPARENT AND SORT OF ANXIETY ABOUT ARE WE -- ARE WE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO BE AS TRANSPARENT AS WE CAN BE? AND SO I WANTED TO EXPRESS SOME OF THAT. I THANK YOU FOR ANSWERING MY QUESTIONS.
02:52:31.775: >> JUST TO ADD ONE FINAL END NOTE ON THIS CONVERSATION, JUST FOR EVERYBODY'S BENEFIT, WE DID ASK THE STATE TO GRANT LEAN ACCESS TO THE MISS OVERSIGHT COMMISSION MEMBERS AND THEY DENIED THAT REQUEST, JUST SO EVERYBODY IS AWARE.
02:52:43.620: >> Councilmember Nelson:  WHO MADE THAT REQUEST?
02:52:46.222: >> IT WAS THE CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE, RIGHT?
02:52:51.161: >> City Atty. Postema: YEAH. THEY ASKED, I THINK -- SENIOR ASSISTANT CITY ATTORNEY ARYAN SLAY W A DESCRIPTION AND A MONTH LATER THEY SENT IT BACK AND I CAN SEND IT TO THE COUNCIL.
02:53:18.988: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN. ZA>> Councilmember Ackerman:  I WOULD REFERENCE DR. JACKSON'S LETTER TO COUNCIL, AND SHE HAS THE PLAY-BY-PLAY OF THE LEAN PROCESS AND THE REJECTIONS WERE ISSUED. DR. JACKSON BEING THE SHARE OF THE INDEPENDENT POLICE COMMUNITY OVERSIGHT COMMISSION. I THINK IN THE LAST YEAR, WE HAVE SEEN TWO MAJOR CHANGES TO THE POLICE DEPARTMENT, CHIEF COX JOINED US FROM THE BOSTON POLICE DEPARTMENT, AND WE CREATED THE INDEPENDENT COMMUNITY POLICE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION, ICPOC. YOU KNOW, WE DID THESE TWO THINGS IN CONJUNCTION, ACCIDENTALLY, BUT ALSO TO OUR BENEFIT. CHIEF COX COMES FROM A POLICE DEPARTMENT WITH, YOU KNOW, A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF EXPERIENCE DEALING WITH COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND COMPLEX COMMUNITIES. AND NOW WE HAVE AN ENTITY IN ICPOC THAT CAN HELP US TAKE A RESPONSIBLE POLICE DEPARTMENT AND MAKE THEM A LOT MORE SENSITIVE TO THE ISSUES OF MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES AND BOTH OF THESE THANKS ARE VERY EXCITING. WHEN WE ENDEAVORED ON THEM OVER THE LAST YEAR, WE EXITED TO RESOURCE ICPOC, WE COMMITTED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THEIR NEEDS WOULD BE OVER THE COURSE OF THE FIRST YEAR, THE INAUGURAL YEAR AND RESOURCE THEM ACCORDINGLY. I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE ARE AIMING TO DO HERE. THE -- YOU KNOW IN, A LETTER FROM DR. JACKSON, THE CHAIR OF THE COMMISSION, THERE'S AN EXPLICIT ASK FOR THIS. IT WASN'T THEIR PLAN A, BUT IT'S A PLAN B THAT SEEMED TO BE SUITABLE. AND I'M ENCOURAGE TO GIVE THEM THE DATA THAT THEY NEED. AS A COMMUNITY WE DECIDED THAT OUR POLICE OFFICERS WILL WEAR BODY CAM. I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF TRANSPARENCY AND OVERSIGHT. BUT PART OF THAT MEANS THERE'S AN IMMENSE AMOUNT OF DATA THAT NEEDS TO BE REVIEWED AND ICPOY NEEDS TO HAVE ACCESS TO THAT DATA TOL TO LIAISE WITH THE POLE DEPARTMENT. I THINK THIS IS ABSOLUTELY APPROPRIATE AND NEEDED AND I TRUST THE LEADERSHIP TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS USED FOR THE BETTERMENT OF THE COMMUNITY. ALSO JUST WITH RESPECT TO THE REDACTIONS AND THE PRIVACY, BASED ON THE CONVERSATION I JUST HEARD, IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF REDACTION IS TO PROTECT THE PRIVACY OF VICTIMS, THE ACCUSED AND BYSTANDERS AS OPPOSED TO --
02:55:52.875: >> I WOULD SAY THAT, BUT I WOULD SAY OUR PRIMARY PURPOSE IS TO STAY WITHIN THE LAW AND COMPLY WITH THE LAW. I MEAN, THAT IS THE -- YOU KNOW, OUR ABSOLUTE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF REDACTIONS TO FULFILL THE REQUIREMENTS. ZAC>> Councilmember Ackerman:  T IS A RARE JOB WHERE EVERYTHING YOU DO IS FILMED AND PEOPLE'S PERSONAL LIVES GET CAUGHT IN THAT AND DON'T NEED TO BE BROADCAST TO THE WORLD. SO THANK YOU.
02:56:21.170: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
02:56:22.739: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANKS. I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION ABOUT THE NEED AND THE WORK THAT IS ENTAILED WITH THE REVIEW OF THE -- AND THE HANDLING OF THE COMPLAINT DISPOSITION, AND THE -- OUR ORDINANCE THAT WE PASSED STATED THAT THE POLICE CHIEF SHALL MAKE THE REPORT WITHIN 30 DAYS, AND THE COMPLAINT DISPOSITION, THE REPORT OUT TO THE INDEPENDENT POLICE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION AND WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT -- AND WE'RE LEARNING AS WE GO ALONG, AS WITH MOST THINGS, WE CANNOT MEET THE 30-DAY TIME FRAME BECAUSE OF THE WORK ENTAILED AND IT IS LABOR INTENSIVE WORK TO DO THE REDACTIONS FOR THE PURPOSES THAT HAVE BEEN EXPLAINED. AND I APPRECIATE COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN, THAT YOU ARE DRAWING OUR ATTENTION TO THE LETTER FROM THE CHAIR, DR. LISA JACKSON. WHAT WE LEARNED, WE DISCUSSED THIS. THIS CAME UP AND WE HAD THESE DISCUSSIONS AT THE LAST TWO, ICPOC MONTHLY MEETINGS AND IN THE COURSE OF THIS, WE CAME TO LEARN ABOUT THE LEAN STATUTE, WHICH IS THE STATE STATUTE, AND THE REQUIREMENT THAT THE -- AS HAS BEEN NOTED THE THAT THE REDACTIONS HAVE TO BE DONE BY THE POLICE AND SO IT'S A STAFFING ISSUE FOR CHIEF COX INITIALLY TO ASSIST THE CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE DID ASSIST, BUT IT'S REALLY -- EXCUSE ME -- A FUNCTION OF THE POLICE AND THE STATE LAW DOES NOT ALLOW CITIZENS OR CITIZENS OVERSIGHT GROUP TO REVIEW UNREDACTED MATERIAL AND IT WOULD ACTUALLY BE A MISDEMEANOR IF WE DID. AND SOW WITH HAVE WONDERFUL VOLUNTEERS SERVING THIS ON THIS COMMITTEE, BUT WE DON'T WANT ANYONE SERVED WITH A MISDEMEANOR OFFENSE. SO WE ARE FOLLOWING THE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS AND TO MEET THIS 30-DAY TIME FRAME, THIS WILL ASSIST IN THAT REGARD. SO, AGAIN, IT'S -- THAT -- THAT WAS -- YOU KNOW, IT'S -- IT WOULD HAVE ADVERSE IMPACTS IF WE DIDN'T ADD THAT POSITION. SO -- AND THIS POSITION CERTAINLY WAS IDENTIFIED IN THE RETREAT MATERIALS AS ONE OF FIVE IDENTIFIED. AS I STATED PREVIOUSLY, I'M CERTAINLY PORTATIVE OF THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AND ADDING POSITIONS AND DEPUTY FORSBERG DID A FANTASTIC JOB, WHEN HE WAS STANDING AT THAT PODIUM AND SPOKE FRANKLY IN SUPPORT OF THE BUDGET AMENDMENT AND SO THOSE POSITIONS WERE ADDED AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME, AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING FTEs THAT WILL BE PART OF THE FISCAL YEAR 21 BUDGET REQUEST. THANK YOU.
02:59:34.330: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
02:59:35.731: >> Councilmember Ackerman: ONE OTHER SMALL THING. ADVOCATE TO THE MICHIGAN STATE POLICE CHANGES IN THEIR LEAN POLICIES. I THINK THAT COULD BE A OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE REPRESENTATIVES WITHOR IRWIN AND A COALITION OF OTHER REPRESENTATIVES, I MEAN WE HAVE ALL OF THESE THAT TRY TO GET MSPs, POLICIES CHANGED.
02:59:56.118: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? I'M -- THANK YOU, CHIEF. I'M CERTAINLY GOING TO BE SUPPORTING THIS. I THINK THAT THE ADDITION OF THIS POSITION WILL BE SUBSTANTIAL UTILITY, FIRST TO ICPOC TO DO THE WORK WE ASKED OF THEM AND SECOND TOO, I THINK AS THE CHIEF INDICATES THE POLICE DEPARTMENT WILL BENEFIT -- THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AND BY EXTENSION THE POLICE DEPARTMENT WILL BENEFIT FROM A LEADERSHIP POSITION IN THE POLICE DEPARTMENT TASKED WITH ENSURING COMPLIANCE WITH POLICIES AND ACCREDITATION PROCEDURES AND SO FORTH THIS IS SOMEBODY WHO IS GOING TO HAVE A FOCUS ON POLICY AND PROCEDURES AND I THINK IT'S -- THEY WILL DO EXCELLENT WORK THAT WILL BE A BENEFIT TO US ALL. FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED WITH 11 COUNCILMEMBERS PRESENT, THUS SATISFYING THE EIGHT VOTE REQUIREMENT. WE HAVE BEFORE US THE SPECIAL SESSIONS MINUTES OF DECEMBER 8 AND 12, AND WORK SESSION OF DECEMBER 9, AND REGULAR SESSION MEETING MINUTES OF DECEMBER 16th, 2019. MOVED AND SECONDED. ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? DC-1, RESOLUTION SUPPORTING THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY'S ACTIVE INVOLVEMENT WITH THE GELMAN SITE AND ENCOURAGING ITS LISTING OF THE SAME AS A SUPERFUND SITE. MOVED BY GRISWOLD AND HAYNER. COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
03:01:39.055: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE TO POSTPOPE THIS TO JANUARY 21st. IS THERE A SECOND?
03:01:49.565: >> Mayor Taylor: YOU STILL HAVE THE FLOOR.
03:01:51.300: >> Councilmember Griswold:  WE EXPECT TO HAVE AN UPDATE REGARDING THE CONSENT JUDGMENT THAT OUR LAWYERS ARE WORKING ON, AS WELL AS CONGRESSWOMAN DEBBIE DINGLE IS HOLDING A JOINT MEETING WITH THE CITY, THE COUNTY COMMISSIONERS, THE TOWNSHIP JUSTEES, AND. I SAID THURSDAY, JANUARY 16th, I BELIEVE IT'S AT 6:30, IT WILL NOT BE A CLOSED SESSION. THE MEETING WILL BE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC. THERE WILL BE A TIME FOR A PUBLIC COMMENT, AND REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE EPA AND EGLE WILL BE THIS TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AND SHARE INFORMATION. I THINK IT'S CRITICAL THAT BEFORE WE TAKE A VOTE OR MAKE A FINAL DECISION IN ANY DIRECTION, THAT WE HAVE ALL OF THE FACTS AND I BELIEVE THAT THIS MEETING WILL BE VERY HELPFUL AND ONCE AGAIN, I WANT TO SHOW MY GREAT APPRECIATION FOR REPRESENTATIVE DEBBIE DINGLE.
03:02:49.091: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE POSTPONEMENT. COUNCIL MAYBE HAYNER.
03:02:53.062: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES, THANKS. I GUESS, I WILL SUPPORT THIS POSTPONEMENT. IT GOT BOUNCED FROM 10/7 AND I THOUGHT WE WOULD LONG HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION TO THIS POINT. IT'S POSSIBLE THAT WE DO BUT THE FACT THAT REPRESENTATIVE DICKLEE IS BRINGING SOME REGION 5 FOLKS TOGETHER, WITH EGLE, WE CAN SEAL WHAT THAT RELATIONSHIP WILL BE LIKE IF WE DECIDE TO GET THE EPA WITH. I THINK IT'S WORTH KICKING DOWN THE ROAD ONE MORE SESSION. I KNOW WE HAD A RECENT SITUATION IN MADISON HEIGHTS WHERE THE FAMOUS GREEN OOZE THAT'S BEEN ALL OVER THE NEWS, AND, YOU KNOW, EPA CAME IN THERE AND THEY SAID, I SAW THE -- I SAW THE PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT IN THE VIDEO ASSESSMENT AND THEY CAME IN THERE AND TOLD DEQ TO CLEAN IT UP. AND THEY FAILED TO CLEAN IT UP AND NOW THE EPA'S NAME IS ON THAT FENCE. AND SO THAT'S ENCOURAGING. I DON'T SEE THAT AS A NEGATIVE FOR THE OPPORTUNITIES WITH THE EPA THAT THEY STEP BACK IN HERE. I'M A LITTLE DISCONCERTED THAT THE AMOUNT OF FOLLOW-UP THAT WAS DONE BUT THAT POLLUTER IS IN PRISON. YOU KNOW, THAT'S GOOD TOO. AND SO, HE I  YEAH, LET'S PASS O ONE MORE MEETING. HOPEFULLY YOU WILL BE THERE ON THE 16th AND I DON'T THINK WE HAVE A LOCATION YET, DO WE?
03:04:27.089: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES, THE WASHTENAW COUNTY LEARNING CENTER.
03:04:30.926: >> Councilmember Hayner: YEAH, THE LEARNING ANNEX.
03:04:33.362: >> Councilmember Griswold: JUST EAST OF CARPENTER.
03:04:36.165: >> Councilmember Hayner:  AND I ENCOURAGE THE PUBLIC AND MY COLLEAGUES TO ATTEND. FOR THAT REASON, I WILL SUPPORT THIS.
03:04:43.839: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT IS -- THE POSTPONEMENT IS APPROVED. DC-IT, RESOLUTION AUTHORIZING APPEALS OF THE DENIALS OF THE CITY'S PETITIONS TO THE STATE BOUNDARY COMMISSION TO ANNEX VARIOUS ASELS FROM THE CHARTER TOWNSHIP OF ANN ARBOR AND CHARTER TOWNSHIP OF PITSFIELD. MOVED AND SECONDED. COUNCICOUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
03:05:06.061: >> Councilmember Bannister:  I HAD A QUESTION ON THIS. DO WE HAVE ANY ESTIMATES FOR HOW MANY HOURS OR COSTS THAT THE CITY WOULD INCUR TO APPEAL THIS ANNEXATION TO THE CIRCUIT COURT?
03:05:23.479: >> City Atty. Postema: WE DON'T AT THAT TIME. FILING THE CLAIM IS QUITE EASY. THE INITIAL CLAIM WITH THE CIRCUIT COURT, AND SO THAT'S NOT A TIME INTENSIVE, THE RECORD IS ALREADY SET, SO IT IS NOT A CASE THAT HAS DISCOVERY. BUT I CAN'T GIVE YOU AN ESTIMATE YET UNTIL I SIT DOWN WITH MR. WILHELM AND WE LOOK AT THAT MORE CLOSELY.
03:05:46.835: >> Councilmember Bannister: DO YOU HAVE LIKE A RANGE OF ATTORNEY'S OFFICE TIME? THE REASON I ASK, WE HAVE LIMITED ATTORNEY'S OFFICE RESOURCES, AND I'M CONCERNED THAT AFTER THE STATE BOUNDARY COMMISSION AND THE LARA DIRECTOR TURNED DOWN THESE ANNEXATIONS BECAUSE OF THE HIGH COST OF HOMEOWNERS TO CONNECT TO THE CITY UTILITIES, WHEN THEY ALREADY HAVE FUNCTIONING WELLS AND SEPTIC SYSTEMS IN MANY CASES, MANY OF THEM KNEW WITHIN THE LAST FIVE YEARS. I'M CONCERNED THAT THE CITY IS SPENDING OUR UNKNOWN LIMITED RESOURCES TO PURSUE APPEALING.
03:06:30.145: >> City Atty. Postema: COUNCILM, OBVIOUSLY WITH ANY LITIGATION, WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT ONGOING, AND IF IT BECOMES A SITUATION THAT YOU WANT TO CHANGE AT ANY POINT, YOU KNOW, YOU CAN CERTAINLY DO IT OR W WE CAN WITHDRAW THE APPEAL AND SO ON. WE ARE ON SOME TIME CRUNCH TO GET THIS FILED ON THE 17th AND SO THAT'S WHAT THE RESOLUTION IS FOR TONIGHT, AND WE HAVE ALREADY PROVIDED YOU ADVICE ON THE REASON FOR THIS.
03:07:00.843: >> Councilmember Bannister: I'M SORRY. YOU WERE FAR AWAY FROM YOUR MICROPHONE.
03:07:05.848: >> City Atty. Postema: I'M SORRY, I WAS MUMBLING, BUT THE -- OBVIOUSLY, AS WITH ANY LITIGATION, YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR VIEW AND ASK US TO DISMISS IT OR GET IT SETTLED, ALTHOUGH IN THIS CASE, IT'S AN APPEAL. AND SO WHAT WE'RE ASKING TONIGHT IS WE HAVE A TIME PERIOD TO FILE THE CLAIM. THAT'S FAIRLY -- THAT'S NOT TIME INTENSIVE, AND -- BUT THAT IS DUE, I THINK ON THE 17th.
03:07:33.108: >> Councilmember Bannister: WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE THEN AFTER YOU FILE IT TO GIVE -- PROVIDE COUNCIL A RANGE OF COSTS?
03:07:40.749: >> City Atty. Postema: YES.
03:07:41.350: >> Councilmember Bannister: SO PURSUE IT AND HOURS AND ATTORNEY'S TIME?
03:07:45.721: >> City Atty. Postema: YES, PROBABLY AT THE NEXT COUNCIL MEETING, I WILL HAVE A BETTER SENSE.
03:07:49.825: >> Councilmember Bannister: PUBLICLY AVAILABLE ON THAT. BECAUSE I THINK THE PUBLIC HAS A RIGHT TO KNOW HOW MUCH -- HOW MUCH TIME THE ATTORNEY'S OFFICE IS SPENDING ON THIS SORT OF ACTIVITY. I WOULD APPRECIATE IT IF YOU WOULD FOLLOW UP ON THAT LATER ON. THANK YOU.
03:08:08.143: >> City Atty. Postema: LET ME THINK ABOUT THAT. I WILL CERTAINLY GIVE THAT INFORMATION TO THE COUNCIL.
03:08:13.949: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION, COUNCILMEMBER GRAND AND THEN HAYNER.
03:08:17.886: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. BRIEFLY, I WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS MY THANKS TO THE ATTORNEY'S OFFICE FOR DEPENDING COUNCIL POLICY AS WE EXPECT YOU TO DO. I'M SURPRISED THIS EVEN NEEDS TO COME BEFORE US. AND I UNDERSTAND HOW TIME SENSITIVE THIS IS, AND I'M GRATEFUL THAT WE WERE ABLE TO BRING MR. WILHELM ON TO OUR ATTORNEY'S STAFF AS HE HAS A LOT OF EXPERTISE AND HE'S FULL ON -- HOPEFULLY HE CAN BE SUCCESSFUL AND HELPING US COMPLY WITH THIS POLICY THAT'S BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR DECADES.
03:08:50.185: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
03:08:51.053: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WAS TRYING TO LOCATE TO THE ATTACHMENTS REFERRED TO IN OUR AGENDA, BECAUSE IT DIDN'T PULL UP WITH MY ELECTRONIC COPY OF THE AGENDA. I WOULD JUST LIKE TO READ WHAT I VOTE ON. COULD THE CLERK OR SOMEONE FORWARD THOSE TO ME? THEY WERE NOT ATTACHED TO ANYTHING THAT I RECEIVED.
03:09:09.304: >> City Atty. Postema: YOU MEAN THE SIGNED ORDERS?
03:09:14.543: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I BEG YOUR PARDON?
03:09:17.212: >> City Atty. Postema: THE FINAL SIGNED ORDERS?
03:09:20.883: >> Councilmember Hayner:  THEY ARE NOT ATTACHED TO THE AGENDA?
03:09:24.820: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I KNOW THEY ARE NOT. DC-2 IS NOT ON MY SHEET. IT DIDN'T SHOW UP ON MY ELECTRONIC COPY.
03:09:30.526: >> Mayor Taylor: THERE MIGHT BE AN AMENDED PACKET WHICH OCCASIONALLY ROLLS IN AS WELL.
03:09:34.263: >> Councilmember Nelson:  THIS WAS ADDED VERY LATE TO THE AGENDA.
03:09:37.933: >> Councilmember Hayner: YEAH, I MEAN, I DOWNLOADED TONIGHT'S WHAT I GOT HERE.
03:09:45.274: >> Mayor Taylor: THERE'S A PACKET ADDENDUM.
03:09:48.577: >> IT'S LISTED AS DC-1 ON THE ADEN ITEM.
03:09:54.683: >> City Atty. Postema: AND COUNCIL DOES HAVE ALL OF THESE SIGNED ORDERS. WE SENT THEM TO YOU ALSO IN NOVEMBER SO I CAN FIND THAT.
03:10:00.289: >> Councilmember Hayner:  IT'S THE SAME ORDERS?
03:10:03.425: >> City Atty. Postema: YES, IT'S THE SAME ORDERS YOU HAD IN NOVEMBER.
03:10:07.763: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? I'M SORRY. COUNCILMEMBER NELSON?
03:10:12.734: >> Councilmember Nelson: ACTUALLY, SINCE, WE ARE ON THE PROCEDURAL TOPIC OF COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER NOT BEING ABLE TO FIND IT I WAS CURE WHY THIS LANDED ON THE AGENDA QUITE SO LATE. I KNOW WE WERE HAVING A WEIRD AGENDA ANYWAY BECAUSE OF THE HOLIDAYS. I THINK THIS LANDED ON THE AGENDA FRIDAY OR FRIDAY AFTERNOON?
03:10:34.256: >> City Atty. Postema: YES, I SENT AN EARLIER COMMUNICATION BEFORE JANUARY. THE ISSUE HAD TO DO WHETHER OR NOT WE ACTUALLY NEEDED TO HAVE A VOTE ON THIS AND MR. WILHELM WENT BACK AND WE LOOKED AT THAT ISSUE AND THE UNDERLYING RESOLUTION WAS -- WAS SPECIFIC AS TO FILING THE CLAIM AND THEREFORE WE BRIEF THIS IN A MEMO TO THE COUNCIL AND SO BECAUSE WE LOOKED AT THAT AGAIN, WE DETERMINED THAT IT TECHNICALLY DIDN'T MEET THAT QUALIFICATION, ALTHOUGH IT'S COMPLETELY CONSISTENT WITH THIS. OBVIOUSLY WHEN THE INITIAL RESOLUTION WOULD COME IN, IT WAS UNHEARD OF FOR THE STATE BOUNDARY COMMISSION WHO ENCOURAGED THE CITY TO DO THIS AS FAST AS POSSIBLE. SO THE FACT THAT THEY WOULD DENY IT, I WOULD NOT CONTEMPLATE IT.
03:11:34.416: >> Councilmember Nelson: SO -- OKAY. THANK YOU.
03:11:43.625: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
03:11:45.127: >> Councilmember Lumm: IT SEEMED LIKE IT WAS A BIT OF A GRAY AREA BUT IT'S CLEARLY BETTER TO HANDLE THIS WITH A COUNCIL RESOLUTION, A PUBLIC MEETING AND I APPRECIATE THIS THIS WAS ADDED TO AUTHORIZE THE APPEAL AND THE -- AS YOU NOTED, MR. POSTEMA, THE GUIDANCE BY THE COMMISSIONER THAT WE NEEDED TO FINISH THESE ANNEXATIONS EXPEDITIOUSLY. SO IT'S A LITTLE COUNTERINTUITIVE, AND I APPRECIATE TAKING THIS ACTION AND IT ALSO DIRECTS THAT WE WILL NOT IGNORE THE PRIOR AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE CITY AND THE TOWNSHIPS. THESE ARE LONGSTANDING AGREEMENTS AS NOTED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRAND. SO I APPRECIATE YOUR WORK ON THIS AS WELL.
03:12:38.547: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
03:12:39.481: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES, THANKS. I GOT TO READ THROUGH IT. I APPRECIATE MY COLLEAGUE HANDING IT OVER TO ME. SO, YOU KNOW, WE -- WHERE THIS STANDS IS THE BODY, IS -- I DON'T RECALL IF I SUPPORTED THESE ARE NOT, HONESTLY, THE BODY DID WHAT THE COMMISSION HAD ASKED US TO DO AND THEY FOUND THAT THE STATE AGREED WITH THEM AND WHEN I LOOK AT AT THEIR COMPLAINTS, I -- I'M VERY SYMPATHETIC WITH THEIR CONCERNS. THEY ARE BASICALLY ASKING FOR SELF-RELIANCE AND WATER AUTONOMY AND THAT SEEMS LIKE SORT OF A BASIC HUMAN RIGHT. YOU'VE GOT A PERFECTLY WORKING WELL AND SEPTIC FIELD AND THE CITY WANTS YOU TO END AND YOU HAVE TO ABANDON THAT WELL AND FIELD EVENTUALLY AND AT GREAT EXPENSE. I'M SYMPATHETIC WITH THEIR CONCERNS AND I'M NOT SURE SURPRISED THAT THE STATE IS GOING BACKWARDS ON THIS BECAUSE THAT'S BEEN THE TENOR OF THE STATE TO BE KIND OF LIKE STAND UP -- WELL, I WON'T SAY THAT. THAT'S TOO BROAD OF A STATEMENT. I'M NOT SURPRISED BY IT. AND I'VE GOT TO SAY AS A BODY, WE DID WHAT THE STATE ASKED AND THEY HAVE APPEALED. AND I'M NOT SO CERTAIN THAT I SUPPORT THIS FIGHTING THAT. I THINK I MIGHT AGREE WITH THE COURTS IN THIS CASE. I'M SORRY TO SAY.
03:14:01.430: >> City Atty. Postema: THE COURT HAS NOT RULED.
03:14:03.732: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I MEAN WITH LARA, I THINK I FINE MYSELF IN AGREEMENT WITH THEIR DECISION. SO YOU WILL HEAR A NO FROM THIS END IF WE HAVE A ROLL CALL VOTE.
03:14:12.741: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
03:14:20.382: >> Councilmember Lumm: [ OFF MICROPHONE COMMENTS ] IT'S NOT SURPRISING. THERE IS AN AGREEMENT, A LONGSTANDING AGREEMENT TO ENACT AND THIS WAS WELL DOCUMENTED AND AGAIN, VERY, VERY LONG STANDING. AND I THINK THERE ARE ISSUES OF EQUITY TO THOSE FOLKS WHO LIVE NEXT DOOR TO SOME OF THESE ITEMS AND SO I -- I -- AGAIN, THIS IS -- THIS IS TO PURSUE FULFILLMENT OF THESE AGREEMENTS. THESE ARE LEGAL AGREEMENTS THAT WE ALL SIGNED OFF ON. I REALIZED MY MICROPHONE WAS NOT ON. I JUST TURNED IT ON. I WON'T REPEAT WHAT I JUST SAID.
03:15:24.312: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
03:15:25.180: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES, I WASN'T GOING TO SPEAK ON THIS. I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO GO WITHOUT MUCH DELIBERATION. I THINK IT'S DANGEROUS FOR US TO DEBATE THIS POLICY AD HOC IN MIDSTREAM HERE. I'M LOOKING AT SOME OF THESE DOCUMENTS AND THESE DOCUMENTS ARE SIGNED OCTOBER 1st, 1994. THIS IS A LONG TIME AGO. FOLKS HAVE KNOWN ABOUT THESE PLANNED ANNEXATIONS FOR DECADES. IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT THEY ARE FACING A HIGHER PROPERTY TAX BILL, BUT IT SHOULD COME TO THEM AS NO SURPRISE. WE HAVE MADE IT MORE FINANCIALLY PALATABLE TO CONNECT TO THE SANITARY LINE AS ONE OF OUR FIRST ORDINANCES THAT WE APPROVED HERE ON COUNCIL TO GIVE FOLKS UP TO 10 YEARS TO SWITCH TO THE SEWER. THEY DEFINITELY NEED TO CONNECT TO THE WATER BECAUSE OF STATE LAW AND COUNTY LAWS, BUT I JUST FEEL LIKE NOTHING HAS REALLY CHANGED IN OUR INITIAL VOTE THAT WE ASKED OUR CITY ADMINISTRATOR AND THE LEGAL DEPARTMENT TO PURSUE ANNEXATION. NOTHING HAS CHANGED IN OUR POSITION. OUR POLICY HAS NOT CHANGED. WHY WOULD WE NOT PURSUE THIS IN THE NEXT LEVEL? SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS AND I THINK WE SHOULD BE ALL SUPPORTING THIS.
03:17:04.613: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER SMITH.
03:17:14.189: >> Councilmember Smith: YES.
03:17:14.789: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES.
03:17:17.192: >> Councilmember Hayner: NOPE.
03:17:18.526: >> Councilmember Bannister: NO.
03:17:19.995: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES.
03:17:23.298: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES.
03:17:23.899: >> Councilmember Grand: YES.
03:17:24.499: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES.
03:17:26.968: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
03:17:27.469: >> Councilmember Eaton: YES.
03:17:28.069: >> Councilmember Nelson:  YES.
03:17:29.838: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION CARRIES.
03:17:31.506: >> Mayor Taylor: OTHER COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE CITY ATTORNEY?
03:17:34.643: >> City Atty. Postema: NO, MAYOR.
03:17:36.511: >> Mayor Taylor: WE HAVE BEFORE US THE CLERK'S REPORT OF COMMUNICATIONS, PETITIONS AND REFERRALS. MAY I HAVE A MOTION TO APPROVE THE CLERK'S REPORT. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, SECONDED BY GRAND. DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? THE CLERK'S REPORT IS APPROVED. WE NOW COME TO PUBLIC COMMENT GENERAL TIME. TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT GENERAL TIME, ONE NEED NOT SIGN UP IN ADVANCE. SPEAKERS HAVE THREE MINUTES IN WHICH TO SPEAK. PLEASE PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE TIME CLOCK. AS A MATTER OF THE COURTESY, WE MAY ONLY HAVE ONE PERSON SPEAKING AT A TIME AND IF YOU REQUIRE ASSISTANCE IN SPEAKING BEFORE COUNCIL TODAY, WE WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO PROVIDE IT TO YOU. IS THERE ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT?
03:18:20.322: >> COULD YOU HOLD THE CLOCK UNTIL I ACCESS MY SPEECH ON MY COMPUTER? THE COMPUTER IS SLOW.
03:18:26.127: >> Mayor Taylor: IF IT WILL BE A MOMENT, PERHAPS THERE'S SOMEONE ELSE WOULD WOU WHO WOULD LIKE T?
03:18:33.001: >> WELL, YOU GO FIRST.
03:18:34.436: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
03:18:39.341: >> I WANTED TO SPEAK ON THE SHORT-TERM RENTAL RESOLUTION THAT WAS PASSED. I GUESS MY QUESTION TO COUNCIL THAT I WOULD LIKE YOU TO THINK ABOUT, IF YOU CAN DO A STUDENT RENTAL ANYWHERE, WHY EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE SIGNING A LEASE, THEY ARE SURE NOT ADDING TO THE QUALITY OF ANY NEIGHBORHOOD. AND I WOULD SAY THAT WHY WOULD YOU LEGISLATE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A SHORT-TERM RENTER COMING IN, WHO IN MANY CASES HAS MORE OF A CONNECTION TO ANN ARBOR THAN ANY STUDENT EVER WILL. AND MOST PEOPLE ARE COMING HERE EITHER BECAUSE OF AN EVENT AT THE UNIVERSITY OR A STUDENT HERE, MEDICAL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. EXCUSE ME. SO IT SEEMS TO ME WE SHOULDN'T BE LEGISLATING THE DIFFERENCE IF WE ARE LOOKING AT RENTALS, LOOK AT STUDENT RENTALS AND ALL THE REST. THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE INVENTED IN SHORT-TERM RENTALS, IF FOR SOME REASON THE RESOLUTION GOES THROUGH AS PASSED, AND THEY ALL TURN INTO STUDENT RENTALS, THEN WHAT HAPPENS TO ALL OF THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS THAT ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE JUST SPENT UPDATING THOSE HOUSES? AND THE NEIGHBOR NEIGHBORHOOD LT BETTER WITH THE SHORT-TERM RENTAL HOUSES THAN IT EVER DID WITH THE STUDENT RENTAL HOUSES. MY OTHER QUESTION IS: I FEEL HIKE THE VOICE OF THE COMMUNITY, YOU TALKED ABOUT A LOT ABOUT WHEN YOU DO THIS LEGISLATION, THAT THERE WILL BE A LOT OF INPUT FROM THE COMMUNITY, YET I FEEL LIKE THE COMMUNITY GAVE A LOT OF INPUT AND YET THIS RESOLUTION STILL PASSED. I WAS AT ALL THE COMMUNITY MEETINGS. THE FEELING OF EVERYBODY AT THOSE MEETINGS, EXCEPT FOR A NUMBER OF A FEW PEOPLE, WAS DO NOTHING, OR DO VERY LITTLE, AND SUDDENLY WE ARE AT NUMBER THREE, DO THE MOST. SO TO ME, I AGREE WITH JEFF, THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE NO DEFINITION OF WHAT THE PROBLEM IS, AND YET WE HAVE COME UP WITH A RESOLUTION OF COMPLETELY SHUTTING IT DOWN, AND IT MAKES ME WONDER HOW MUCH INPUT WOULD REALLY BE LISTENED TO WHEN THE ORDINANCES ARE ACTUALLY BEING CREATED. SO I HOPE THAT THIS -- AND I HOPE THAT THERE'S PEOPLE WHO ARE LISTENING TO WHAT PEOPLE SAY THEY WANT INSTEAD OF ANECDOTAL EXAMPLES FROM SPECIFIC NEIGHBORHOODS OR SPECIFIC PEOPLE WHO HAVE TRAVELED TO PLACES THAT AREN'T LIKE ANN ARBOR IN IN I WAY SHAPE OR FORM. THAT'S IT.
03:20:54.576: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
03:20:55.577: >> OH, I'M SORRY. I DID HAVE ONE MORE THING. AND YOU ARE PENALIZING THOSE OF US WHO FOLLOWED THE RULES WOULD HAVE AGENTS IN TOWN, REGISTERED AGENTS WHO HAVE REGISTERED PROPERTIES AND HAD THEM INSPECTS AND IF YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW MANY SHORT-TERM RENTALS THERE ARE OUT THERE, ADD IT TO THE REGISTRATION. SO THOSE OF WHITE US WHO DO FOLE RULES CAN SAY IT'S A SHORT-TERM RENTAL AND YOU CAN SEE HOW MANY THERE ARE, AND GIVE PEOPLE A DATE TO SAY IF YOU WANT TO BE GRANDFATHERED IN, HERE'S YOUR STATE. MAKE SURE YOU ARE REGISTERED HERE. WE WILL GRANDFATHER YOU IN BECAUSE NOW WE KNOW THAT YOU ARE A SHORT-TERM RENTER. THAT'S IT.
03:21:30.545: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
03:21:37.385: >> THREE RATIONALES ARE PROPOSED FOR THE ANN ARBOR ANNUAL DEER KILL. TRAFFIC SAFETY IS A FALLACIOUS RATIONALE. GIVEN THAT MOST DRIVERS EXCEED THE SPEED LIMITS. THIS IS BASED ON MY PERSONAL OBSERVATION. SO THAT STRICT ENFORCEMENT OF LOWER SPEED LIMITS AND OTHER BETTER HIGHWAY ENGINEERING WOULD REDUCE DEER VEHICLE COLLISIONS AND SAVE MOTORISTS, CYCLISTS AND PEDESTRIANS FROM INJURY. THE ANN ARBOR OBSERVER IN JUNE 2019 REPORTED THAT ANN ARBOR PEDESTRIAN ACCIDENTS ARE INCREASING, AND THAT FROM 2000 TO 2008, THERE WERE SEVEN DEATHS BUT FROM 2009 TO 2017, INCLUDING TWO YEARS OF THE CULL, THERE WERE NINE. I COMMEND COUNSELOR GRISWOLD FOR THE CITY'S INADEQUATE PEDESTRIAN SAFETY MEASURES. THAT C CULL PROPONENTS ARE NOT SERIOUS ABOUT DISEASE PREVENTION AS SHOWN BY THE USE OF DEER BAITING IN THE CULL, WHICH THE MICHIGAN DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES BANNED IN THE LOWER PENINSULA, BECAUSE BAITING SPREADS CHRONIC WASTING DISEASE. CWD MAY CAUSE KRAUTSFELD DISEASE. THE ONLY RATIONALE FOR THE DEER CULL, WHICH MAKES ANY SENSE IS THE HABITAT DESTRUCTION AND THIS IS A RED HERRING AS SHOWN BY THREE CULL PROPONENTS FOR ORDINANCE 19-30 TO REZONE 7.7 ACRES AT 2875 PACKARD FROM PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT WHICH ENTAILS CUTTING 300-YEAR-OLD TREES. I COMMEND COUNCILORS EATON, GRISWOLD, RAMLAWI, BANISTER AND NELSON FOR VOTING AGAINST THIS HABITAT DESTRUCTION. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM VOTED BOTH TO KILL THE DEER AND TO CUT THE TREES AND HAS AN UNETHICAL RELATIONSHIP FOR THE ORIGINATORS OF THE CULL. THE ONLY HAS BEEN CAT THAT -- HT THAT MS. LUMM CARES ABOUT IS HER AFTER FLUENT FRIENDS GARDENS.
03:24:20.815: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WOULD WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT?
03:24:23.818: >> I WOULD LIKE TO ASK HOW MANY COUNCILMEMBERS ATTENDED THE SHORT-TERM RENTAL MEETINGS. JUST A SHOW OF HANDS. HOW MANY ATTENDED ALL OF THEM. HOW MANY IN HERE ATTENDED ALL THE SHORT-TERM RENTAL MEETINGS. YOUR JOB AS ELECTED OFFICIALS IS TO REPRESENT YOUR CONSTITUENTS AND HAD YOU BEEN AT ALL OF THEM, YOU WOULD KNOW THAT THERE WAS A RESOUNDING OPPOSITION TO OPTION THREE. I HAVE A SHORT-TERM RENTAL. MY FAMILY HAS SHORT-TERM RENTALS AND I AM NOT OPPOSED TO REGULATION AS I THINK MOST OF US WOULD AGREE. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS SHOULD BE REGISTRATION. WE CARE ABOUT OUR HOMES. I DON'T WANT A FOOTBALL RAGER AT MY HOUSE, TRUST ME. I SCREEN THE PEOPLE THAT I RENT TO. I'M VERY RESPONSIBLE NEIGHBOR. THE PERSON WHO LIVED IN MY HOME PRIOR TO ME WAS A SINGLE MAN WHO TRAVELED 80% OF HIS TIME. NONE OF THE NEIGHBORS MY STREET EVEN KNEW HIS NAME. I KNOW EVERY SINGLE ONE OF MY NEIGHBORS. THIS HE SEE ME ON A WEEKLY BASIS. I MAY NOT SLEEP AT MY HOUSE, BUT I'M THERE WEEKLY. I TAKE CARE OF MY LAWN. I PLOW MY DRIVEWAY AND ALL OF THAT WAS DONE BEFORE I MOVED INTO MY HOME. I WOULD GATHER IF YOU ASKED MY NEIGHBORS, WHO WOULD THEY PREFER ON THEIR STREET, THEY WOULD SAY ME. I'M CURRENTLY REPRESENTING TO A FAMILY, MOTHER WHO IS A HIGH-RISK PREGNANCY. SHE WILL BE DELIVERING HER BABY AT U OF M AND IF HER BABY SURVIVES WILL LIKELY END UP IN THE NICU FOR SEVERAL WEEKS. SHE CANNOT INBOUND A RESIDENCE INN. THSHE CANNOT AFFORD A HOTEL AND THERE'S ISSUES WITH SAFETY AND CLEANLINESS. WE HAVE RENTED TO ONCOLOGY PATIENTS WOULD HAVE COME TO MICHIGAN FOR TREATMENT. THEY CAN NOT STAY IN HOTELS. WHEN YOU GO THROUGH CHEMOTHERAPY, THERE ARE GERMS. THEY NEED A PRIVATE RESIDENCE TO LIVE IN. THERE ARE A LOT OF POOR ASSUMPTIONS. THERE'S A LACK OF EDUCATION ON HOW SHORT-TERM RENTALS ARE RUN, HOW THEY ARE REGULATED AND THERE'S A LOT OF TALK ABOUT TAXES, AND WE DON'T PAY OCCUPANCY TAXES WHEN THAT'S FALSE AND I THINK THESE ASSUMPTIONS NEED TO BE EXPLORED. I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE DATA. MY HUSBAND IS A 22 VETERAN OF THE POLICE DEPARTMENT, NOT ONCE HAS HE BEEN CALLED TO A SHORT-TERM RENTAL IN HIS CAREER. IF YOU ASK HIM HOW MANY TIMES HE HAS BEEN DISPATCHED TO LONG-TERM RENTALS AND STUDENT HOUSINGS AND IRRESPONSIBLY SUBLETS, HE WILL TELL YOU IT HAPPENS ON A DAILY BASIS. THERE ARE STUDENTS WHO SUBLET THEIR APARTMENTS FOR TWO MONTHS AND THREE MONTHS THAT'S NOT REGULATED, AND THAT SHOULD BE SUBJECT. IF YOU ARE NOTING TO REGULATE SHORT-TERM RENTALS THAT SHOULD BE INCLUDED. THANK YOU.
03:27:00.341: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
03:27:09.717: >> I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE SHORT-TERM RENTALS. I TOOK SOME NOTES. SO I'M PRETTY BUMPED ABOUT COUNCILMEMBERS THAT VOTED YES, DESPITE SAYING THAT OPTION THREE WAS NOT THE WAY TO GO. THAT'S WHAT THIS VOTE WAS ABOUT, AND YOU GUYS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE LEADERS TOX MAYBE HAVE A BACK BONE. SO I AGREE WITH COUNCILMAN HAYNER ABOUT THIS SEEMS LIKE IT'S A SOLUTION IN SEARCH OF A PROBLEM. I DON'T THINK THIS IS ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING. I DON'T THINK IT'S ABOUT CHANGING CHARACTER OF NEIGHBORHOODS IT'S ONLY 3% OF HOUSESES. I DON'T THINK IT'S ABOUT ORDINANCE VIOLATIONS. THE ONLY POINT THAT MAKES SENSE TO ME IS THE ZONING ISSUE THAT THEY BROUGHT UP. BUT I FEEL LIKE TRYING TO FIT THE NEW SHARING ECONOMY INTO OLD ZONING LAWS WILL NOT WORK. WE NEED TO ADOPT -- ADAPT TO THE TIMES AND WE NEED TO MAKE THE RULES. SO I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE ARE DOING THIS. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE ARE DOING IT IN SUCH AN EXTREME WAY. 95% OF AIRBNBs ARE NONOWNER OCCUPIED AND YOU ARE ESSENTIALLY BANNING AIRBNBs. I CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT.
03:28:21.155: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT?
03:28:28.496: >> DWIGHT SMITH. THE ONLY ONGOING NONPARTISAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE EVER! I HAVE SPOKEN BEFORE THE COUNCIL BEFORE. SEVERAL OF THE MEMBERS ARE NEW. THE POINT I WOULD MAKE IS ONE THAT I MADE BEFORE. AND THAT IS MY FATHER IS A REAL JENGENUINE Ph.D. WILDLIFE BIOLOGISTS AND HE WOULD TELL YOU THE CULLS DO NOT WORK. THEY ARE A GROSS WASTE OF TAX MONEY. THANK YOU.
03:29:04.165: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
03:29:14.375: >> OKAY. LIKE OTHERS BEFORE ME, I'M TALKING ABOUT THE SHORT-TERM RENTAL ISSUE AND I KNOW IT'S LATE. SO I WILL TRY TO MAKE IT BRIEF. ON THE PLUS SIDE, LOOK AT HOW MANY OF US ARE GETTING INVOLVED IN LOCAL POLITICS THAT HAVE NEVER BEEN HERE BEFORE. IT'S MY FIRST CITY COUNCIL MEETING. I'M GLAD I CAME. I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK ON THE HUMAN SIDE OF IT. OBVIOUSLY THIS HAVE BEEN A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO INVESTED A LOT OF MONEY IN HOUSES THAT FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE BEEN MISLED AND A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE IMPROVING THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS WHO FEEL LIKE IT'S NOT REALLY ADEQUATELY REPRESENTING THEM. BUT ON MY END, I SPENT THE LAST TWO YEARS OR SO BUILDING A SMALL BUSINESS IN ANN ARBOR. AND I'M JUST TIRED. IT'S NOT LIKE I'M NOT TEARING UP OR ANYTHING. I SPENT THE LAST TWO YEARS BUILDING A SMALL BUSINESS, HELPING PEOPLE MANAGE THEIR BNBs AND SPENT A LOT OF NIGHTS AND WEEKENDS AND I HAVE A FEW CLEANERS HELPING ME NOW. FOR US, THIS IS A LIVELIHOOD. THIS HAS A LARGE IMPACT ON, YOU KNOW, WHAT WE DO AS CAREERS. I WANT TO PUT A FACE ON THAT SIDE OF IT AND SAY, YOU KNOW, THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO LIVE -- IT'S NOT JUST, YOU KNOW, IT WAS MENTIONED WE YOU HAVE IN THE PRPRIORITIZE. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING IN TOWN, WHO ARE ALSO, YOU KNOW, BEING SEVERELY IMPACTED BY THIS DECISION. I HOPE THAT THAT'S KIND OF KEPT IN MIND GOING FORWARD AS, YEAH, THE COMMENTS ARE MADE TO THE CITY STAFF. AND, YEAH, JUST LIKE ON THE POINT OF THE PRIORITIZING PEOPLE WHO ARE FROM OUT OF TOWN. THERE ARE OWE TELLS DOWNTOWN, BUT THEY ARE LARGELY EXPENSIVE AND I KIND OF MENTIONS THIS IN MY PUBLIC COMMENT. IF YOU REALLY ARE ON A BUDGET AND TRYING TO STAY DOWNTOWN, THERE ARE VERY FEW OPTIONS. AND SO A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD ARE STAYING IN THE PLACES THAT I WORK WITH ARE PEOPLE WHO FIT INTO THAT CATEGORY. WE WANT PEOPLE EXPERIENCING DOWNTOWN AND OBVIOUSLY THAT DOES COME SOMETIMES AT A COST THAT'S BEEN MENTIONED, BUT, YEAH, I THINK THAT THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO STAY DOWNTOWN WHO MIGHT NOT OTHERWISE AND LIKE A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE MENTIONED, THERE ARE REALLY A LOT OF PEOPLE COMING TO THE HOSPITAL AND COMING IN FOR EXTENDED STAYS WHO ARE LOOKING FOR THESE KIND OF OPTIONS AND WHO REALLY BENEFIT AND WON'T GET THAT FROM OWNER OCCUPIED OPTIONS. IT'S A REALLY -- YOU DON'T NECESSARILY SEE IT BUT AS HOSTS WE SEE IT AND THERE ARE -- THERE IS A NEED FOR THAT OPTION. SO THE LAST THING IS JUST THAT WE'RE TAKING LITERALLY ONE OF THE MOST RESTRICTIVE APPROACHES ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY. THERE ARE OTHER CITIES DOING THINGS LIKE THIS BUT IT'S FREW AND FAR BETWEEN. OTHER CITIES ARE FINDING A WAY TO REGULATE THIS EFFECTIVELY. I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE SAID THEY ARE KIND OF FOR THAT. REGISTERING -- ONCE WE REGISTER SHORT-TERM RENTALS WE KNOW WHERE THEY ARE AND WE CAN LIMIT THE AMOUNTS IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS AND DEVELOP SOLUTIONS THAT HELP BOTH SIDES. I HOPE THAT WE WILL NOT JUST JUMP INTO THE MOST RESTRICTIVE APPROACH BECAUSE IT SEEMS EASY. THANKS A LOT FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.
03:32:12.586: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
03:32:16.157: >> I WANT TO SAY, I ALSO COME TO TALK ABOUT THE SHORT-TERM RENTALS. YESTERDAY I WAS HERE AND I PRETTY MUCH SAY THE SAME THING, AND I'M REALLY, REALLY GLAD TO ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND THAT MANY OF YOU ON THIS PANEL ACTUALLY HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO USE AIRBNBs AND YOUR SHORT-TERM RENTALS IN YOUR TRAVELS AROUND AND IN YOUR BUSINESS. WHEN EVERYBODY TALKED, EVERYBODY TALKED ABOUT HOW WE PRIORITIZE THE NEIGHBORHOOD ABOVE THE VISITORS THAT WE GET, OR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE VACATIONING. THE TRUTH IS THAT IT'S NOT LIMITED TO PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUALLY VACATIONING AT ALL OR OCCASIONALLY COMING HERE TO WATCH FOOTBALL. THE TRUTH IS SOME OF US WHO ARE OPERATING THESE SERVICES GIVEN THE AMENITIES, WE ARE ACTUALLY HELPING OUR NEIGHBORS AS WELL. I TALKED ABOUT YESTERDAY, ABOUT IN THE -- LET ME SLOW DOWN BECAUSE ACTUALLY, I'M ONE OF THOSE ANGRY LANDLORD. I HAVE DONE MORE THAN PATCHING WALLS THAT I CARE TO DO. THANK YOU, COUNCILMAN HAYNER. I HAVE CHANGE CHANGED COMMODE. I HAVE BEEN RENTING HOUSES FOR OVER DECADES. I'M TIRED OF DOING THAT. WHSO I SOLD ALL OF MY PROPERTIE. WHEN I MOVED TO ANN ARBOR, I WASN'T GOING TO RENT ANYMORE. BUT THIS OPPORTUNITY CAME. AND FOR ME, HAVING A FAMILY, WHEREBY WE DON'T HAVE THE OPTION OF USING IT OURSELVES. MY KIDS HAVE ALLERGIES. AND I SO HAVE TO STAY IN AN AIRBNB. I HAVE TO WIPE EVERY PLANE DOWN, BEFORE I PUT MY KID DOWN ON THE PLANE. AND I DO THE SAME THING ON THE HOTEL ROOM. DO UNTO OTHERS AS YOU HAVE THEM DO UNTO YOU. WHEN I TRAVEL AROUND THE WORLD AND I HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO STAY IN GREAT PLACES WHERE OUR CHILDREN WERE ABLE TO PLAY. THE SAME I HAVE DECIDED WHILE I'M IN ANN ARBOR, I WILL DO THAT FOR OTHER PEOPLE AS WELL. SO I DOVE INTO THIS THING. SO WHAT YOU GUYS HAVE PASSED TONIGHT IS REALLY KILLING THE SPIRIT THAT I HAVE AND THE LOVE THAT I HAVE FOR THIS CITY BECAUSE MY IDEA IS THAT THE ANN ARBOR THAT I'M EXPERIENCING AND THE THING IS THAT I HAVE BEEN HERE. I WANT TO SHARE WITH SOMEBODY ELSE AND I CAN TELL YOU, IN THE TIME THAT I HAVE BEEN HERE, ONE YEAR THAT I HAVE BEEN DOING THIS NOW IN ANN ARBOR, AND SOME OF OUR NEIGHBORHOODS HERE, IN ANN ARBOR, THEIR HOUSE BURN DOWN. THEY STAYED IN AN AIRBNB. RIGHT NOW MY WIFE SENT ANOTHER PERSON THAT WE ARE HOSTING RIGHT NOW, BECAUSE I DON'T EVEN KEEP TRACK OF IT, HAD AN ACCIDENT, ALMOST FATAL ACCIDENT AND HE'S RETURNING BACK TO U OF M TO FINISH UP HIS DEGREE AND HIS PARENTS HAVE TO COME STAY WITH HIM. THIS IS HOW WE ARE HELPING OUR NEIGHBORS, PEOPLE. THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT TRAVELERS OR FOOTBALLERS ALONE. I WILL STOP AT THAT. THANK YOU.
03:35:23.477: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
03:35:33.420: >> HELLO, EVERYBODY. HAPPY 2020. I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHERE I'M GOING TO GO WITH THIS. BUT I GUESS, FIRST OF ALL, I'M IN A PRETTY GOOD MOOD TODAY BECAUSE I LUCKILY FOUND A PLACE WHERE I CAN MOVE IN. SO I DON'T HAVE TO SLEEP IN MY CAR WHICH I HAD PREFERRED TO THAN THE WARMING CENTER AT THE DELON IS CENTER. THERE WERE PREVIOUSLY 70 BEDS CRAMMED IN ONE ROOM WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE SICK, A LOT OF -- AND I WAS -- I KIND OF DECIDED THAT THE HYPOTHERMIA OR THE PNEUMONIA I COULD CATCH IN MY CAR WOULD BE BETTER THAN THAT ENVIRONMENT FOR ME. SO THAT'S WHAT I HAVE BEEN DOING. I WILL NOT TELL YOU WHERE I PARKED. BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, A REASON WHY YOU DON'T HEAR A LOT OF HOMELESS VOICES HERE IS BECAUSE THEY WON'T GO ANYWHERE NEAR CITY HALL. THEY WON'T GO ANYWHERE NEAR THE POLICE STATION BECAUSE OF HARASSMENT. OR THE FEAR OF HARASSMENT, NOT REAL OR IMAGINED. THEY ARE JUST IN THAT KIND OF POSITION. I MET A MAN WOULD -- YOU KNOW, I USUALLY RAN INTO HIM A LOT ON THE STREETS. I HADN'T SEEN HIM IN A WHILE AND I SAW HIM. HE'S LIKE, HEY, MAN, I HAVE BEEN IN JAIL FOR 17 DAYS. I'M LIKE, THEY FINALLY GOT ME ON THIS WARRANT THAT WAS -- HE TOLD ME IT WAS FROM PETTY THEFT FROM -- AND REALLY THE JAMES JAE WAS FOR FAILURE TO APPEAR IN COURT. SO, YOU KNOW, THERE'S THOSE KINDS OF ISSUES. BUT I ALSO WANTED TO SPEAK UP ABOUT THE DEER BECAUSE I DO HAVE AN OPINION ON THIS BEFORE THAT, I WILL END WITH THAT. I WILL SAY THAT THIS IS ON DECEMBER 16th. THE U.S. SUPREME COURT, ON MONDAY LEFT A LOWER COURT RULING IN PLACE THAT STRUCK DOWN A LAW MAKING IT A CRIME TO SLEEP IN PUBLIC PLACES WHEN HOMELESS SHELTER SPACE IS UNAVAILABLE. SO JUST SO YOU KNOW, A STATEMENT -- IT IS LEGAL TO SLEEP IN A PUBLIC PARK OR A STREET AS A HOMELESS PERSON AND I HOPE THE POLICE WILL KNOW THAT. ABOUT THE DEER, MY SOLUTION IS TO RE-INTROTUESDAY WOLVES. YOU GET SOME WOLVES HERE, THAT TAKES CARE OF IT RIGHT AWAY. AND THIS WAS A TIME WHEN PEOPLE ON THIS LAND THAT WE SQUABBLE ABOUT FOR EVERY RICH REASON AND WAY COEXISTED WITH THE DEER AN THE WOLVES. SO --
03:38:35.068: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT?
03:38:47.714: >> YOU GUYS ARE BREAKING A LOT OF HEARTS TONIGHT WITH THIS SHORT-TERM RENTAL STUFF. SO I'M PROBABLY GOING TO BE THE LAST PERSON TO TALK ON IT. SO HOPEFULLY YOU WON'T HAVE TO HEAR TOO MUCH MORE OF IT. BUT I JUST WANTED TO GO THROUGH A FEW THINGS. SO FIRST OFF, IT'S ALREADY BEEN SAID, BUT REALLY IT SEEMS LIKE THE GENERAL SUPPORT FOR AIR BBNBs ON A PERCENTAGE BASIS IS PRETTY OVERWHELMING. I WOULD LOVE TO SEE A POLL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, BUT IT SEEMS LIKE NOT EVEN JUST A MAJOR DEMAJORITY BUT KIND OF AN OVERWHELMING NUMBER OF PEOPLE WANT AN AIRBNB. ON OUR COMMUNITY PEOPLE WE HAD 59 PEOPLE WO WHO WANTED TO STAYD ONE PERSON WHO WAS NOT AGAINST IT. SO A LARGE, LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE REALLY, REALLY WANT THIS. A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE, YOU KNOW, STARTED SMALL BUSINESSES. I MEAN, MY MOM AND I, WE DO STUDENT RENTALS, LONG-TERM RENTALS, AND SHORT-TERM RENTALS. AND SHORT-TERM RENTALS ARE MOST FUN. YOU GET TO ACTUALLY MAKE THEM REALLY NICE. I MEAN, WE PICK OUT ALL OF OUR FURNITURE. EVERY FIXTURE, WE DESIGN EVERYTHING OURSELVES. WE HAVE BOUGHT PROPERTY IN ANN ARBOR FOR THE LAST 12 YEARS AND RENOVATE THEM AND RENT THEM OUT TO STUDENTS, FAMILIES, OR, YOU KNOW, SHORT-TERM RENTALS. I CAN TELL YOU SOME OTHER THINGS. THESE PROPERTIES ARE NOT SITTING IN THE WINTER. THEY ARE GENERALLY OCCUPIED JUST AT LOWER RATES. I CAN SAY THAT LONG-TERM RENTALS DON'T HAVE AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF SUPPORT IN THIS CITY TO FIN WITH. I HAVE HAD A -- TO BEGIN WITH. I HAVE HAD NEIGHBORS TELL ME THIS IS NOT A RENTAL NEIGHBORHOOD. THERE'S SOME RESENTMENT TOWARDS BUSINESS, IT DOESN'T MATTER IN WHAT FACET. SO I -- I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, AS STUDENT AND LONG-TERM RENTAL PEOPLE, ARE YOU GOING TO BAN LONG-TERM RENTALS? AFFORDABILITY, THAT'S A PRETTY -- I THINK IT HAS -- I DON'T KNOW THE IMPACT IT HAS AND I DON'T THINK YOU GUYS DO EITHER AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT. I CAN TELL YOU WHAT THE PROBLEM IS WITH AFFORDABILITY IN ANN ARBOR BEING AN INVESTOR IS OUR COST OF THE LAND AND COST OF CONSTRUCTION. OUR COST OF CONSTRUCTION IS NOT GOING TO CHANGE. OUR COST OF LAND CAN IF YOU GUYS WORK ON THE ZONING CODE TO ALLOW FOR MORE AFFORDABLE USING AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS TO BE DEVELOPED, THEN THIS CAN HAPPEN, BUT IT'S NOT HAPPENING, AND SO I DON'T THINK THAT IT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR YOU TO TRY TO STALL AFFORDABILITY BY GETTING RID OF THE SHORT-TERM RENTALS. I HAVE A CLEANER THAT WE EMPLOYED JUST TO, YOU KNOW, DO OUR TURNOVERS AND NOW SHE GETS TO WORK FOR US EVERY DAY. AND, YOU KNOW, SHE'S ABLE TO NOW PROVIDE FOR HER FAMILY. SHE CAME FROM ANOTHER COUNTRY, IMMIGRATED HERE AND WE LOVE WORKING WITH HER. ALSO, THIS IS MOSTLY LOCAL PEOPLE DOING THIS. THIS IS NOT A CORPORATE THING. PEOPLE ARE NOT BUYING PROPERTIES. WE ALL KNOW EACH OTHER BY NAME.
03:41:59.873: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
03:42:00.807: >> AND THERE'S NO HOTEL LOBBYING. I THINK AS A COMMUNITY, WE SHOULD SAY THAT THIS IS IN THE BEST INTEREST. THANK YOU.
03:42:07.681: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT? SEEING NO ONE, PUBLIC COMMENT IS CLOSED. ARE THERE COMMUNICATIONS TODAY FROM COUNCIL? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
03:42:26.133: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I PROMISE, I WILL KEEP IT UNDER THREE MINUTES. I'M SITTING HERE LISTENING TO THESE FOLKS AND THE WHOLE MEETING AND THE CONVERSATION WE HAD AND I'M STRUCK BY ONE THING THAT WAS SAID, ESPECIALLY, WHEN IT WAS KIND OF SUGGESTED THAT PEOPLE WHO TAKE ADVANTAGE OR USE SHORT-TERM RENTALS ARE NOT PART OF YOU COMMUNITY AND CLEARLY THAT'S BEEN REFUTED BY THESE SPEAKERS AND I APPRECIATE YOU COMING FORWARD AND SPEAKING. AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT VERY CHRISTIAN OF US TO SAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT. AND IT'S A STRANGER DANGER SITUATION, BUT ON THE OTHER FACE OF THAT IS EVERY DAY WE WELCOME 80,000 PEOPLE INTO OUR COMMUNITY AND THEY DON'T PAY TAXES. WE HAVE 45,000 STUDENTS WHO SOME REGISTER AND VOTE AND BE PART OF OR COMMUNITY AND SOME DON'T. THOUSANDS OF HOTEL ROOMS, AND FIVE OR SIX WEEKENDS WE HAVE 100,000 PEOPLE, 110,000 PEOPLE WHO WE DON'T KNOW EITHER AND HALF OF THEM ARE DRUNK. ON ONE HAND, WE PROMOTE THINGS LIKE ADUs AND GROWTH AND MIXED USE AND DENSITY. AND ON THE OTHER HAND, WE COMPLAIN ABOUT MAYBE THERE'S A BUSINESS IN A NEIGHBORHOOD. WELL, THAT'S MIXED USE. MAYBE THERE'S SOMEBODY RENTING OUT PART OF THEIR HOUSE. WELL, THAT'S AN ADU. SO THOSE ADUs AND MIXED USE AND DENSITY, THOSE ARE NOT FOR CURRENT RESIDENTS, THAT'S FUTURE RESIDENTS. THOSE ARE PEOPLE WE DON'T KNOW. THOSE ARE STRANGERS. SO NOT ONLY ARE WE NOT BEING VERY CHRISTIAN AND WELCOMING BUT WE ARE BEING HYPOCRITICAL ABOUT WHAT WE SAY. AND I KNOW I GET A LOT OF GRIEF OUT THERE IN THE COMMUNITY AND SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES, AND I KNOW SOME OF YOU CAN'T WAIT TO HAND IT OFF TO THE NEWS, THE LETTERS I WRITE YOU. IF THERE'S TWO THINGS I'M GOING TO WORK FOR HERE ON CITY COUNCIL, IT'S CLEAN WATER AND END OF THE HYPOCRISY THAT WE HAVE.
03:44:26.653: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
03:44:27.554: >> Councilmember Bannister: AND I JUST WANTED TO THANK ALL OF THESE LAST FIVE OR SIX PUBLIC COMMENTERS ABOUT SHORT-TERM RENTALS. I WOULD RUN OUT AND HAND EACH OF YOU MANY I CARD BUT INSTEAD THROUGH THIS COMMENT, I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO KEEP IN EMAIL, CITYCOUNCIL@A2GOV.ORG. I IT WAS A DIFFICULT DECISION ON TONIGHT'S VOTE AND I THINK EVERYONE HERE WANTS TO GET IT RIGHT IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. SO YOUR FEEDBACK AND INPUT MUCH LIKE YOUR PUBLIC COMMENTS TONIGHT, SHORT EMAILS BUT, YOU KNOW, ARE REALLY HELPFUL IN US AS WE SHAPE IT, WHAT THE FINAL VOTE WILL BE IN JULY.
03:45:18.238: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
03:45:19.072: >> Councilmember Lumm: AND I WOULD MAKE AN APPEAL TO OUR LONG-TERM RESIDENTS WHO LIVE IN THEIR HOMES, IN THESE NEIGHBORHOODS THAT ARE IMPACTED BY NON-OCCUPIED SHORT-TERM RENTALS, WE -- I ATTENDED ONE OF THE MEETINGS AND IN SPEAKING TO OTHERS WHO ATTENDED ALL OF THE MEETINGS, APPARENTLY THE MEETING I ATTENDED WAS THE DYNAMIC -- THE DYNAMIC WAS VERY TYPICAL, IN THAT AT ONE POINT IN THE MEETING, FOLKS WERE ASKED TO BREAK OUT INTO THE GROUPS. AND INVARIABLY, WHAT WE FOUND -- AND I THINK THIS IS REFLECTIVE, FOR EXAMPLE, FROM THE ECOMMENTS WE RECEIVED TONIGHT AND I THINK SOME THAT WAS PR PRECIPITATED BY AIRBNB SENDING OUT AN EMAIL TO THEIR MEMBERS AND TO COME AND SPEAK TONIGHT AND SPEAK TO CITY COUNCIL WHICH IS FREE SPEECH WORLD, THAT'S ALL WELL AND GOOD BUT I DO THINK AT THE SAME TIME, THAT THAT IS -- BECAUSE THAT LOBBY IS SO STRONG, AND THIS IS A VERY LUCRATIVE BUSINESS, THAT MUCH LIKE AT THE PUBLIC MEETINGS, WHERE IN THESE GROUPS OF, SAY, TEN, YOU HAD ONE NEIGHBORHOOD REPRESENTATIVE, AND NINE PEOPLE OUT OF THE TEN WERE AIRBNB HOSTS. THAT THE FOLKS I HAVE HEARD FROM ARE NEIGHBORS. ARE LONG-TERM RESIDENTS. THE PEOPLE WOULD LIVE IN THEIR HOMES IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS WHO DON'T RENT OUT THEIR PROPERTIES AND WOULD OCCUPY THEIR HOMES, AS THEIR PRIMARY RESIDENTS FELT THAT THEIR VOICES WERE DROWNED OUT AND I WILL CONTINUE TO BE AN ADVOCATE FOR THE -- THE VITALITY AND THE QUALITY OF OUR NEIGHBORHOODS AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE OUR RESIDENTS WHO MAY OR MAY NOT BE TUNING IF BUT WHO HAVE CONTACTED US TO STAY ENGAGED. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE HEAR FROM YOU. I FRANKLY THINK THAT YOU ARE WHAT MAKE OUR NEIGHBORHOODS STRONG AND WE ARE HERE TO REPRESENT YOU PRIMARILY. YOU KNOW, I RECOGNIZE THIS IS A LUCRATIVE BUSINESS AND BUT I DO THINK IT'S BEEN POINTED OUT AT THE BREAK, SOME PEOPLE NOTED THAT THERE ARE REALLY NOT TOO MANY OF THESE. WHY IS THIS NECESSARY? THAT WAS ONE QUESTION THAT WAS POSITED TO ME. BUT I DO THINK THAT, LIKE OTHER COMMUNITIES, THAT ARE FRONTING THIS, AND INSTITUTED REGULATIONS, WE ARE COMING AT THIS BECAUSE IT WAS BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION AS A CONCERN AND SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO GET AHEAD OF. I DO APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT'S GONE INTO THIS THUS FAR AND LOOK FORWARD TO OUR DEVELOPING REGULATIONS THAT WILL HELP TO STRENGTHEN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS AND REPRESENT THE CONCERNS OF OUR RESIDENTS.
03:48:28.795: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER COMMUNICATION FROM COUNCIL? COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
03:48:31.197: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU. I HAVE WANT TO MAKE TWO CLARIFYING STATEMENTS WITH REGARDS TO MY COMMENTS REGARDING MR. HESKOWITZ'S COMMENTS. FIRST, I WAS SPEAKING ON MYSELF AND NOT THE BODY, AND HIS COMMENTS AT CITY COUNCIL TONIGHT AND IN YEARS PRIOR. OTHER PEOPLE CAN INTERPRET THOSE FACTS DIFFERENTLY.
03:48:57.323: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER COMMUNICATION? I GUESS, YOU KNOW, I WOULD JUST LIKE TO OBSERVE THAT NO ONE HERE, I THINK, AT COUNCIL DENIES THE UTILITY OF SHORT-TERM RENTALS FOR PROPRIETORS, THE UTILITY FOR PEOPLE THAT AVAIL THEMSELVES OF SHORT-TERM RENTALS, THE SHORT-TERM TENANTS. YOU KNOW, THE -- AND I THINK PEOPLE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THIS HAS BEEN AN INVESTMENT MADE IN HOMES AND THAT A CHANGING LANDSCAPE COULD AFFECT THOSE INVESTMENTS AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I THINK WE WILL HAVE TO ALL TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH ANY ORDINANCE RELATED TO THESE RENTALS. I THINK IT'S ALSO TRUE AND IT'S NOT AT ALL INCONSISTENT TO OBSERVE THAT PEOPLE MOVE IN INTO A RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT THEY WILL BE SURROUNDED BY RESIDENTS. PERSONS WHO AVAIL THEMSELVES OF SHORT-TERM RENTALS. THAT IS TO SAY SHORT-TERM RENTERS, THEY ARE NOT RESIDENTS. I DON'T HAVE PROBLEMS WITH PEOPLE SHOPS IN THEIR HOUSES OR TEACH MUSIC OUT OF THEIR HOMES. IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF THE COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISE. THE CONCERN I IDENTIFIED RELATES TO THE -- LIKE I SAID, THE EXPECTATION THAT ANN ARBOR RESIDENTS WILL BE SURROUNDED IN RESIDENTIAL AREAS BY OTHER RESIDENTS. I THINK THAT THAT IS WHAT MAKES OUR COMMUNITY. I DON'T THINK FURTHER THAT THAT'S AT ALL INCONSISTENT WITH THE IDEA THAT WE SHOULD HAVE MORE RESIDENTS THAT MORE RESIDENTS IN A NEIGHBORHOOD IS A GOOD THING, THAT IT'S GOOD TO HAVE AD Us TO PERMIT HOMEOWNERS, PROPERTY OWNERS TO RENT THEIR PROPERTY TO LIVE ON THEIR LAND WITH THEM AND PARTICIPATE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD,
