00:02:10.320: >> OKAY. THANK YOU. WELL, THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING. THANK YOU, MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL AND MAYOR MAYOR TAYLOR E OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. MY NAME IS DAVE DeVARTI, I LIVE AT 1231 BALDWIN IN ANN ARBOR. I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN ANN ARBOR PUBLIC PLANNING FOR SEVERAL YEARS HAVING SERVES ON THE PLANNING COMMISSION, AND DOWNTOWN DEVELOPMENT ADMINISTRATION, AND CURRENTLY SERVING THE CITY ON THE ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS AND THE COUNTY AS AN ELECTED MEMBER OF THE WASHTENAW COUNTY BOARD OF TRUSTEE. I COME TONIGHT TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF PASSING A FIRST READING, THE PROPOSED MINOR TEXT CHANGE IN THE PUD FOR DOMINICK'S RESTAURANT ON MONROE INDUSTRY. DOMINICK WAS MY FATHER. I STARTED WORKING THERE IN JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL. THAT'S MY BROTHER'S RESTAURANT. I NO LONGER HAVE ANY FINANCIAL INTEREST. SEVERAL GENERATIONS OF LAW SCHOOL STUDENTS, ALUMNI, COMMUNITY MEMBERS FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE HAVE MET AND ENJOYED EACH OTHER'S CONVERSATION AND COMPANY OVER THE PAST 60 YEARS IN THE RESTAURANT AND ON ITS PATIOS, BALCONY AND IN ITS GARDEN. I WANT TO EMPHASIZE A COUPLE OF POINTS IN FAVOR OF THIS PROPOSAL. FIRST, MY BROTHER RICH AND THE OWNER OF THE GREEN PLANET BUSINESS ON THE CORNER OF MONDAY ROE AND TAPPAN HAVE AGREED TO ADD A RAIN GARDEN IN THE NORTHEAST CORNER OF THE PARCEL TO ASSIST THE CITY IN REDUCING ONE OF ITS GOALS, REDUCING RAIN WATER FLOW IN THE STORMWATER SYSTEM. THIS IS A POSITIVE BENEFIT FOR THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY. SECOND, THE CURB CUT IN QUESTION AT THE MOMENT, DIRECTLY SERVES AN APARTMENT THAT'S BEEN A PART OF THE DOMINICK'S -- OF NO, OFDOMINICK'S SINCE IT BECAME ONE FIRST PUDs IN THE CITY. I'M NOT SURE IF IT WAS THE FIRST OR SECOND WHEN THE PUD ORDINANCE WAS FIRST ALLOWED. UP WITH THE REASONS THAT MY DAD --
00:04:33.864: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
00:04:34.765: >> OKAY. ONE THE REASONS MY DAD UNDERTOOK TO DO A PUD WAS TO KEEP THE HOUSING THERE. SO THERE'S AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT THIS DRIVEWAY SERVES. PLEASE VOTE YES TO MOVE THIS PROPOSAL TO A PUBLIC HEARING A SECOND READING. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AND I HOPE YOU ALL HAVE A GOOD THANKSGIVING.
00:04:56.420: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS SCOTT MUNZEL.
00:05:07.330: >> MR. MONDAYZEL, PHONE NUMBER 310 GO AHEAD.
00:05:10.700: >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MAYOR AND CITY COUNCILMEMBERS. GOOD EVENING. THIS IS SCOTT MUNZEL SPEAKING FROM 9 JEFFERSON COURT ANN ARBOR, MICHIGAN. I'M THE ATTORNEY REPRESENTING THE GREEN PLANET WHICH IS THE TENANT AT 700 TAPPAN STREET AND THE LICENSEE OPERATING FROM THAT LOCATION FOR MANY YEARS. THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A COUPLE OF BRIEF COMMENTS ABOUT YOUR AGENDA ITEM C-2. BASICALLY, WE ARE ASKING THAT YOU SCHEDULE A SECOND READING AND HOLD A PUBLIC HEARING ON THIS PROPOSAL TO SLIGHTLY REVISE THE TEXT OF PUD SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS. AT THAT PUBLIC HEARING, WE CAN EXPALESTEXPLAIN THE PROPOSAL, AD EXPLAIN THE PUBLIC BENEFITS BEING OFFERED AND EXPLAIN, IN FACT, WHY THE PROPOSED TEXT AMENDMENT ACTUALLY RETURNS THE PUD TO ITS ORIGINAL INTENT RELATED TO THE TIMING OF THE REMOVAL OF THOSE CURB CUTS OR THE TIMING OF THE REMOVAL OF THAT CURB CUT. AND SO WE'RE REQUESTING THAT THE CITY COUNCIL SCHEDULE THE SECOND READING, AND THE PUBLIC HEARING TO MORE FULLY EXPLAIN TO COUNCIL THOSE ISSUES AND THANKS AGAIN FOR THE TIME, AND I CAN ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS WHEN YOU GET TO THE ITEM C-2 ON THE AGENDA. THANKS VERY MUCH.
00:06:45.195: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS BLAINE COLEMAN.
00:06:58.441: >> MR. COLEMAN, PHONE NUMBER 941, PLEASE PRESS STAR SIX TO UNMUTE YOUR PHONE. GO AHEAD.
00:07:04.548: >> THIS IS BLAINE COLEMAN. ALL HUMAN RIGHTS MOVEMENTS OF THE 1960s AND '70s CAME OUT OF THE BLACK FREEDOM MOVEMENT WHICH WAS THOUSANDS OF COMPLETELY DEFENSELESS PEOPLE, PUTTING THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE AGAINST THE BRUTE FORCE OF AMERICAN CITY COUNCILS, STATE GOVERNMENTS AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SO IT'S ESPECIALLY SICKENING FOR ANN ARBOR CITY COUNCIL TO PRETEND -- TO PRETEND THAT IT SUPPORTS HUMAN RIGHTS WHILE THROWING UP A STONEWALL AGAINST ANY PROPOSAL -- ANY PROPOSAL FOR PALESTINIAN HUMAN RIGHTS. YOU, THE CITY COUNCIL, STOOD LIKE A STONE WALL AGAINST BLACK CIVIL RIGHTS. BASIC, MOST BASIC BLACK CIVIL RIGHTS. PHYSICALLY, YOU STOOD AGAINST FAIR HOUSING LAWS UNTIL DEMONSTRATORS OUTSIDE YOUR COUNCIL BUILDING FORCED YOU TO FINALLY BREAK DOWN THAT WALL IN 19 # 3. YOU THE CITY COUNCIL STILL STAND LIKE A STONE WALL AGAINST THE THOUSANDS WHO DEMONSTRATED FOR PALESTINIAN HUMAN RIGHTS, RIGHT OUTSIDE YOUR BUILDING LAST SUMMER. WHILE ISRAEL HAD JUST FINISHED MURDERING PALTINIANS. THOSE DEMONSTRATES LOUDERLY DEMANDED THAT YOU APPROVE AT RESOLUTION AGAINST MILITARY AID TO ISRAEL. PRETTY SIMPLE, WOULDN'T YOU SAY? BUT, NO, YOU STILL STAND LIKE A STONE WLGAIN THE THOUSDS OF PEOPLEHO A PITIONING YOU TO APPROVE THE RESOLUTION AGAINST MILITARY AID TO ISRAEL. AND FOR 20 YEARS, YOU HAVE BEEN A STONE WALL AGAINST EVEN THE SLIGHTEST RESOLUTION # FOR PALESTINIAN HUMAN RIGHTS. IT SEEMS LIKE YOU HAVE NO SHAME. NO SHAME AT ALL. ARE YOU EVEN HUMAN? WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO OFFER THOSE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO WERE DEMANDING THE MOST BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS AGAINST YOUR GUNS, YOUR MONEY, YOUR MILITARY AID TO ISRAEL WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO OFFER TO PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS? HERE'S WHAT YOU HAVE TO OFFER, YOU APPROVE RESOLUTIONS TO GIVE THE WHOLE POPULATION PSYCHEDELIC DRUG WITHOUT MEDICAL SUPERVISION. YEAH, YOU APPROVED THAT.
00:09:49.112: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
00:09:49.879: >> YOU APPROVE RESOLUTIONS TO GIVE THE WHOLE POPULATION MARIJUANA CONSUMPTION LOUNGES. YEAH, AWE  YOU APPROVED THAT TO. THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE PASSIONATE ABOUT, NOT BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS. CERTAINLY NOT PALESTINIAN HUMAN RIGHTS, NOT JOBS, NOT AFFORDABLE HOUSING, NOT ANY MEANINGFUL:DOWN OF THE 50-YEAR TOXIC GELMAN PLUME.
00:10:19.676: >> Clerk Beaudry: TIME.
00:10:21.044: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS MOZHGAN SAVABIEASFAHANI.
00:10:27.150: >> I HAVE TO SAY STAR 6?
00:10:34.424: >> Clerk Beaudry: PHONE NUMBER 941, GO AHEAD.
00:10:45.068: >> CAN YOU HEAR ME?
00:10:48.872: >> Mayor Taylor: YES, WE CAN. MY NAME IS MOZHGAN SAVABIEASFAHANI. ANN ARBOR CITY COUNCIL WANTS YOU TO BELIEVE THAT THEY CARE ABOUT OUR HEALTH AND OUR ENVIRONMENT. DO THEY REALLY? IS THAT WHY FOR 50 YEARS, MAYBE 60, THEY HAVE ALLOWED THE GELMAN DIOXANE CONTAMINATION TO GROW AND BECOME THE LARGEST IN THE WORLD, YES, YOU HEARD IT RIGHT, THE LARGEST IN THE WORLD. YOUR SO-CALLED CONCERN FOR OUR ENVIRONMENT IS SO DEEP, THAT PFAS IS OOZING OUT FOR SEVERAL YEARS WITH YOU DOING VIRTUALLY NOTHING TO STOP IT. NORTHERN CITY COUNCIL WANTS US TO BELIEVE THAT THEY CARE ABOUT OUR QUALITY OF LIFE. WHAT BIG WORLDS! IS THAT WHY NOT ONE OF THEM HAS EVER PROPOSED $15 MINIMUM WAGE FOR PEOPLE OF ANN ARBOR, FOR WORKERS OF ANN ARBOR? IS THAT WHY YOU HAVE NEVER, NONE OF YOU, PROPOSED A $15 MINIMUM WAGE FOR ANN ARBOR WORKERS? IS THAT WHY THEY BEND OVER BACKWARDS TO PLEASE DEVELOPERS, DEVELOPERS WHO USE CITY SUPPORT AND APPROVAL AND THROW A PITTANCE TO THE CITY IN THE FORM OF AFFORDABLE HOUSES. THEY HOUSE THE ULTRA RICH IN THEIR LUXURY APARTMENTS AND LEAVE THE REST OF US ON THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING WAITING LIST. AFFORDABLE HOUSING WAITING LIST THAT'S GROWING BY LEAPS AND BOUNDS, WHAT BULLSHIT, YOU EXPECT US TO BELIEVE YOU? ANN ARBOR CITY COUNCIL WANTS TO YOU BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE PROGRESSIVE AND CHAIR ABOUT HUMANITY AND HUMAN RIGHTS. NOTHING COULD BE MORE LAUGHABLE. LET'S SEE NOW, IS THAT WHY FOR 20 YEARS YOU BLUFFED ANY RESOLUTION TO BOYCOTT ISRAEL? IS THAT WHY YOU HAVE TURNED A BLIND EYE AND A DEAF EAR TO CRIES OF THOUSANDS OF PROTESTERS THROUGHOUT THE YEARS, DEMANDING THAT AT THE VERY LEAST OW SHOULD STOP MILITARY AID TO ISRAEL? AT LEAST SAY THAT YOU ARE AGAINST MILITARY AID TO ISRAEL. HAVE YOU? NONE OF YOU HAVE! HOW DO YOU WANT US TO BELIEVE YOU ARE PROGRESSIVE AND YOU CARE ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS? YOU ARE LIARS. ANN ARBOR CITY COUNCIL RECORDS SHOWS THAT IT IS A BUNCH OF RACIST BASTARDS, MASQUERADING AS HUMAN BEINGS. YOU ANN ARBOR CITY COUNCIL ARE SERVANTS OF THE RICH AND WEALTHY IN THIS TOWN. ANYONE WHO CAN'T SEE THAT IS EITHER ASLEEP OR DEAD. BE WARNED THERE ARE REAL PROGRESSIVES AND REAL HUMAN RIGHTS ADVOCATES IN THIS TOWN WHO HAVE BEEN FIGHTING FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND FOR CLEANUP OF GELMAN DIOXANE PLUME AND FOR $15 MINIMUM WAGE AND FOR PUBLIC HOUSING. THERE ARE REAL HUMAN BEINGS WHO REALLY CARE ABOUT THIS. WE WILL FIGHT YOU EVERY ELECTION DAY, IN BETWEEN THEM AND WE WILL KICK YOU OUT!
00:14:02.799: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
00:14:03.466: >> YOU PASS THE RESOLUTION THAT WE ARE AGAINST MILITARY AID TO ISRAEL TO AT LEAST IMPROVE YOUR ATROCIOUS RECORD.
00:14:11.607: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS MICHELLE HUGHES.
00:14:24.187: >> Clerk Beaudry: MICHELLE HUGHES. GO AHEAD AND UNMUTE YOURSELF.
00:14:26.723: >> HI, THIS IS MICHELLE H HUGHS AND TODAY IS PART OF TRANS AWARENESS WEEK THAT'S GOING ON UNTIL NOVEMBER 19th AND THEN ON NOVEMBER 20th, IT'S THE TRANS DAY OF REMEMBRANCE WHERE WE REMEMBER THE TRANS PEOPLE WHO WERE MURDERED THIS YEAR, IN TRANSPHOBIC VIOLENCE. AND I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO COME AND ASK YOU GUYS ABOUT SOME THINGS I ASKED ABOUT BACK IN MARCH AND SEE IF THERE'S ANY PROGRESS ON THAT. I WAS HOPING THAT WE COULD HAVE A NEW ORDINANCE THAT REQUIRES BUSINESSES TO POST INFORMATION ABOUT OUR NONDISCRIMINATION ORDINANCES IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE POSTING IS VISIBLE TO CUSTOMERS AND TO EMPLOYEES, BECAUSE I KNOW TOO MANY TRANS PEOPLE HAVE BEEN FIRED FROM THEIR JOBS IN ANN ARBOR FROM BEING TRANS OR HAVE SUFFERED TRANSPHOBIC HARASSMENT AND DECIDED TO QUIT THEIR JOBS HERE IN ANN ARBOR. AND I KNOW TOO MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN DENIED SERVICES FOR BEING TRANS HERE IN ANN ARBOR. AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S -- SOME PEOPLE KNOW THAT THERE'S AN ORDINANCE IN ANN ARBOR THAT MAKES THAT ILLEGAL. SOME PEOPLE KNOW THAT THEY CAN CALL THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION. SOME PEOPLE KNOW THAT THEY CAN CALL THE STATE'S CIVIL RIGHTS COMMISSION, BUT WE CAN'T REALLY COUNT ON -- OUR MANS SHOULDN'T BE THAT PEOPLE JUST HAVE TO KNOW THIS STUFF. OUR PLANS SHOULD BE THAT THIS INFORMATION IS POSTED, EVERYWHERE IT'S LIKELY TO BE A PROBLEM, AS EVERY BUSINESS AND OUR PLAN SHOULD BE THAT THIS WILL CAUSE BUSINESSES TO THINK TWICE BEFORE DOING SOMETHING LIKE THAT, BEFORE BEING TABS TRS PHOBIC AND WILL GIVE PEOPLE IDEAS WHAT THEY CAN DO IF THEY DO EXPERIENCE DISCRIMINATION. I HOPE TO HEAR DURING COMMENTS FROM COUNCIL, SOMEBODY TELL ME OR MAYBE EMAIL ME LATER THAT THIS IS IN THE PROCESS SOMEWHERE, THAT MAYBE THE LAWYER'S OFFICE IS WORKING ON IT, OR MAYBE IT'S GOING TO BE DISCUSSED AT A COMMISSION SOMEWHERE. I HOPE WE HAVE SEEN SOME PROGRESS ABOUT IT IN MARCH WHEN I ASKED FOR IT IN THE FIRST PLACE. SO WHEN TRANS PEOPLE HAVE APPLIED FOR A NAME CHANGE.
00:16:55.271: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
00:16:56.806: >> WE NEED TO GET OUR FINGERPRINTS AND GET A BACKGROUND CHECK. WE HAVE TO GET OUR FINGERPRINTS AT THE WASHTENAW POLICE DEPARTMENT. AND AT GRANDVILLE, THEY DO IT AT THE CITY HALL. I HOPE WE CAN DO THAT HERE TOO. GET FINGERS PRINTS AT CITY HALL SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO TO THE POST OFFICE WHEN WE GET FINGERPRINTS. THOSE ARE MY TRANS DAY AWARENESS ASKS OF YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
00:17:28.905: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS STEVE SONNTAG.
00:17:43.519: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER 190, PRESS STAR SIX TO UNMUTE YOUR PHONE. GO AHEAD.
00:17:49.325: >> OKAY. CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW?
00:17:51.727: >> Mayor Taylor: YES, WE CAN.
00:17:54.531: >> OKAY. GREAT. SO FIRST, I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE -- THANK AND COMMEND THE ANN ARBOR CITY COUNCIL AND ALL THE PAST CITY COUNCILMEMBERS WHO HAVE ENACTED ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY POLICIES. I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT. FOR INSTANCE, I LOVE THE FACT THAT WE CAN GET BEHIND THE CITY BUS AND NOT HAVE IT SPEW TOXIC FUMES INTO OUR FACE AND THEY ARE USUALLY HYBRID BUSES. AND I LOVE TRAFFIC CIRCLES THAT KEEP THE TRAFFIC MOVING AND CUT DOWN ON AIR POLLUTION. I FEEL LIKE WE ARE IN A LIFE AND DEATH BATTLE TO STAVE OFF THE ITEMS. I WOULD LIKE TO ASK A SMALL REQUEST OF TRAFFIC LIGHTS. SOMETIMES I DRIVE LATE AT NIGHT, AND SOME OF THE TRAFFIC LIGHTS NASH YELLOW, AND/OR RED, WHICH IS GREAT. IT KEEPS TRAFFIC MOVING AND CUTS DOWN ON AIR POLLUTION, BUT SOME ARE CYCLING THROUGH THEIR SLOW, BORING, NORMAL CYCLE AS IF THERE'S HEAVY TRAFFIC AND IT'S 3 A.M. IN THE MORNING AND I'M SITTING THERE IDLING AWAY AND PUTTING EXTRA POLLUTION INTO THE AIR FOR NO REASON. SO I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE IF SOMEBODY COULD PLEASE, PLEASE LOOK INTO THE TRAFFIC LIGHTS THAT ARE OPERATING NORMALLY WITH THEIR SLOW, BORING CYCLES AND, YOU KNOW, IT WOULD BE GREAT IF WE COULD ELIMINATE THOSE, HAVE THEM FLASH RED AND/OR YELLOW, TO KEEP TRAFFIC MOVING AND CUT DOWN ON AIR POLLUTION. I REALIZE ANN ARBOR CAN'T SAVE THE WORLD, BUT IN THE FUTURE, WE NEED TO LOOK BACK AND SAY WITH A CLEAR CONSCIOUS THAT ANN ARBOR DID EVERYTHING THEY COULD, EVEN IN SMALL WAYS TO HELP STAVE OFF CLIMATE CATASTROPHE. THANK YOU.
00:20:10.099: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS GLEN NELSON.
00:20:18.140: >> MR. NELSON, PHONE NUMBER 733. GO AHEAD.
00:20:21.877: >> MY NAME IS GLENN NELSON. I'M ONE. LEADERS OF CITIZENS FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND PUBLIC SAFETY. I APPLAUD YOUR ATTENTION TO UNARMED PUBLIC SAFETY RESPONSE. I WILL MAKE TWO POINTS. FIRST, CITY OFFICIALS SHOULD RECOGNIZE A 24/7 UNARMED CRISIS RESPONSE TEAM ALREADY EXIST AND SERVES ANN ARBOR ASELL AS THE REST OF THEOUNTY. WATENAWOUNTY MENLEALTH PRID THIS SERVICE. THE TELEPHONE NUMBER IS 734-544-3050. BASED ON INFORMATION FROM THE CALLER THE MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS WILL ANSWER AND DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE RESPONSE. CHOOSING FROM OPTIONS SUCH AS SENDING THE CMH MOBILE CRISIS SERVICE TEAM OR CONNECTING THE CALLER WITH THE CMH CARES TEAM WHICH A ACTS AN INFORMATION CENR OR OUTPATIENT CLINIC OR SENDING EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES OR SENDING POLICE OFFICERS AS BACKUP OR HANDOFF. CITY OFFICIALS SHOULD AVOID DUPLICATING SERVICES WHICH WOULD CREATE CONFUSION AND WASTE TAXPAYER DOLLARS. SECOND, CITY OFFICIALS SHOULD EDUCATE RESIDENTS ABOUT USING THE EXISTING CRISIS TEAMS. COUNCILMEMBERS SHOULD FUND A CAMPAIGN TO INFORM CITY RESIDENTS ABOUT THE CMH 24/7 NUMBER AND OTHER CURRENT AND UPCOMING CRISIS INITIATIVES LIKE 988. THROUGH THE COUNTY WE RESIDENTS OF ANN ARBOR HAVE 24/7 ACCESS TO UNARMED MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS, SUBSTANCE ABUSE EXPERTS EMERGENCY MEDICAL TECHNICIANS AND PEER SUPPORT SPECIALISTS. RESIDENTS NOT NEEDED OR WORSE MIGHT ESCALATE TO A MANAGEABLE PROBLEM INTO A CRISIS. IT SHOULD BE CALLING 544-3050, RATHER THAN 911. THIS INFORMATION IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR RESIDENTS WHO DELAY CALLING 911, BASED ON PAST BAD EXPERIENCES WITH POLICE. EVERYONE'S SAFETY WOULD BE IMPROVED BY EDUCATING RESIDENTS ABOUT CALLING 544-3050 PROMPTLY. THE FUNDS FOR THIS RECOMMENDATION ARE READILY AVAILABLE FROM THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH AND PUBLIC SAFETY MILLAGE SENT DIRECTLY TO THE CITY.
00:22:59.468: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
00:23:00.369: >> SUCH AN EDUCATION CAMPAIGN WOULD IMPROVE SAFETY AND WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH THE INTENT OF VOTERS WHO SUPPORTED THE MILLAGE. THANK YOU.
00:23:14.383: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS AMIR FLEISHMAN.
00:23:22.958: >> MR. FLEISHMAN. PHONE NUMBER 632. MY NAME IS AMIR, I'M A GRAD STUDENT AT U.M. I'M ALSO A MEMBER OF G.O. HOUSING CAUCUS. I'M CALLING TO TALK ABOUT THE TOTAL FAILURE OF THE CITY TO ENFORCE THE EARLY LEASING ORDINANCE. G.E.O. HAS RECEIVED HUNDREDS OF COMPLAINTS FROM RENTERS WHO ARE STILL BEING PRESSURED BY THEIR LANDLORDS TO RENEW THEIR LEASE, LESS THAN THREE MONTHS INTO THE TERM. LANDLORDS ARE SAYING THAT THEY ARE SIGNING OPTIONS, QUOTE/UNQUOTE WITH OTHER RESIDENTS. SO THEY ARE GETTING AROUND THE EARLY LEASING ORDINANCE BY STILL ENTERING INTO ANOTHER FORM OF AGREEMENT. THEY FEEL VERY STRONGLY THAT THE CITY IS NOT READING OF ORDINANCE IN THE MAXIMALIST INTERPRETATION THAT COULD BE USED TO PROTECT RENTERS. THIS IS NO URGENCY FROM THE CITY ABOUT THIS HUMONGOUS PROBLEM THAT IS AFFECTING THE MAJORITY OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS. INDEED, THINGS HAVE GOTTEN WORSE SINCE THE PASSAGE OF THE EARLY LEASING ORDINANCE, AS LANDLORDS ARE RETALIATING AGAINST US AND PRESSURING US TO RENEW OUR LEASES EVEN EARLIER THAN THEY HAVE IN THE PAST. RENTERS ARE HURTING. WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU? OUR EXODUS SHOULD NOT BE DOING THE WORK OF COMBING THROUGH COMPLAINTS AND SENDING THEM TO THE CITY ON YOUR BEHALF. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE A BUREAUCRACY! USE IT TO SERVE YOUR RESIDENTS! IT IS YOUR JOBS TO GO THROUGH TO THE COMPLAINTS. YOU NEED TO BE DOING THIS, NOT US. WE HAVE JOBS. MY PEOPLE ARE BECOMING CYNICAL ABOUT WORKING WITH THE CITY. THEY NO LONGER WANT TO ENGAGE WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT BECAUSE THEY SEE IT AS A WASTE OF TIME. AND FRANKLY, I'M HAVING A HARD TIME JUSTIFYING IT TO THEM. IS THIS THE IMPRESSION OF CIVIC ENGAGEMENT THAT YOU WANT TO GIVE TO YOUR RESIDENTS? RENTEERS CANNOT WAIT. RENTERS UNDER ASSAULT FROM LANDLORDS AND YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT TRAFFIC LIGHTS. WHAT WILL YOU DO TO HELP REPREREPRRENTERS? YOU NEED TO ACT. THANK YOU. FREE PALESTINE.
00:25:46.669: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS AMANDA CARLISLE.
00:25:51.440: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER 298, PRESS START SIX TO UNMUTE YOUR PHONE. CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING ON 298, PRESS STAR SIX.
00:26:06.822: >> GOOD EVENING. THIS IS AMANDA CARLISLE. I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE WASHTENAW HOUSING ALLIANCE AND TONIGHT I WANT TO SHARE MY CONCERNS WITH YOU ABOUT THE NEW HUMAN SERVICES PARTNERSHIP WHICH IS REPLACING WHAT WE KNEW AS THE PAST DECADE FOR COORDINATED FUNDING. I'M URGING YOU TO EXTEND HUMAN SERVICES, TRANSITION GRANT CONTRACTS FOR ANOTHER SIX MONTHS AND CONSIDER ALTERNATE FUNDING MODELS THAN WHAT HAS SO FAR BEEN PROPOSED BY THE COUNTY. AS BACKGROUND, THE WHA IS A COALITION OF NONPROFIT AND GOVERNMENT PARTNERS WORKING TO END HOMELESSNESS IN WASHTENAW COUNTY. OUR COALITION MEMBERS INCLUDE THE NONPROFIT AGENCIES THAT PROVIDE A CONTINUUM OF SERVICES IN HOUSING THAT HELP PEOPLE OBTAIN AND MAINTAIN HOUSING. OVER THE PAST DECADE, WASHTENAW COORDINATED FUNDERS PROVIDED CRITICAL FUNDING TO MONDAY PROFIT HUMAN SERVICES AGENCIES IN THE AMOUNT OF $4.3 MILLION ANNUALLY AND TO THE HOMELESS SYSTEM OF CARE IN THE AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY $1.3 MILLION ANNUALLY. THESE DOLLARS HAVE BEEN USED TO THEN LEVERAGE OTHER FEDERAL AND PRIVATE FUNDING TO SUPPORT PROGRAMS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO THE PEOPLE MOST IN NEED IN OUR COMMUNITY. THE HOMELESS SYSTEM OF CARE HAS RELIED ON THESE FUNDS TO PROVIDE SERVICES LIKE STREET OUTREACH, SINGLE POINT OF ENTRY, EMERGENCY SHELTER AND PERMIT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING AND SERVICES. OUR SYSTEM OF CARE RELIES ON COMMUNITY PARTNERS THINKING NOT AS INDIVIDUAL AGENCIES OR PROGRAMS, BUT AS A SYSTEM, AND IT IS FOCUSED ON HELPING THE MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTY. AS A RESULT OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED AND COORDINATION EFFORTS, WE HAVE SEEN A REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE EXPERIENCING UNSHELTERED TREAT HOMELESSNESS BY 78% AND REDUCTION OF OVERALL HOMELESSNESS SINCE 2015. OUR PROGRESS IN MAKING HOMELESSNESS NONRECURRING WILL BE UPENDED WITH IN THE NEW PARTNERSHIP AS IT'S DESIGNED BECAUSE AGENCIES WILL NO LONGER HAVE A RELIABLE SOURCE OF FUNDING. IN THE EMAIL I SENT YOU EARLIER TODAY, I SHARED WITH YOU A DETAILED TIMELINE OF THE COUNTY'S PROCESS TO NON-PRIVATE PARTNERS TO THE SHIFT IN THE FUNDING MODEL. COMMUNICATIONS AND ACTIONS ABOUT THE NEW FUNDING MODEL HAVE BEEN DELAYED TIME AND TIME AGAIN OVER THE AFTER YEAR WHAT WAS PROPOSED TO AGENCIES BY EMAILS ON FRIDAY IS A SHIFT FROM HOLDING A SAFETY NET GRANT, TO AL ALTERNATIVE PROCESS THAT EXCLUDES MANY CRITICAL SUPPORTIVE SERVICES AND HOUSING PROGRAMS FROM FUNDING. THE COUNTY IS CHANGING PROCESS TESS LAST MINUTE WHEN THEY ARE IN JEOPARDY OF HAVING TO FUNDING IN 45 DAYS. THE THIS SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED TO CIRCUMVENT A PRO S SIS BECAUSE THE COUNTY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DEVELOP A NEW HUMAN SERVICE FUNDING MODEL. IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE THAT THE COUNTY HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO DEVOTE THE TIME AND EFFORT THEY NEED TO REVAMP A FUNDING MODEL THAT HAS EXISTED FOR THE PAST DECADE. WE ARE STILL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PANDEMIC AND THERE HAVE BEEN COMPLETING PRIORITIES. PLEASE EXTEND CONTRACTS FOR AT LEAST ANOTHER SIX MONTHS SO A MORE THOUGHTFUL AND EQUITABLE APPROACH CAN BE DEVELOPED. WE ALL WANT THIS TO WORK. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TONIGHT.
00:29:12.274: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. ARE THERE COMMUNICATIONS TODAY FROM COUNCIL? MS. BEAUDRY, DO I HAVE HAND AUTHORITY? COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
00:29:34.029: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I ENCOURAGE YOU TO JOIN ME ON SATURDAY AT 10:00, THE HUSTLE FOR HOMELESS EVENT WILL OCCUR. IT WILL INCLUDE SPEAKERS, A TWO-MILE WALK AND THEN REFRESHMENTS. SECONDLY, I KEPT HEARING A THEME ABOUT COMMUNICATIONS, THE NEED TO IMPROVE COMMUNICATIONS. WHETHER IT BE AN ORDINANCE THAT WE PASS THAT PEOPLE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT OR COMMUNICATING SIGNIFICDECISIONSBEING MADE. AND SOMETHING I WAS THINKING ABOUT EVEN BEFORE MEETING, THAT I FIND TROUBLING AND IT PUTS AN EXTRA BURDEN ON STAFF, IS THAT WE PASS ONE ORDINANCE OR RESOLUTION AFTER ANOTHER, AND WE DON'T ALWAYS COMMUNICATE OUT OR HAVE A STRONG IMPLEMENTATION PLAN, BUT THERE'S CONFLICTS BETWEEN THOSE ORDINANCES AT TIMES AND SO I THINK THAT WE NEED TO STEP BACK AND LOOK AT HOW WE CAN REDUCE THOSE CONFLICTS. BE IT A2ZERO, THE TRANSPORTATION PLAN, AND WHEN WE DON'T REDUCE THOSE CONFLICTS, PEOPLE ARE CONFUSED AND ONCE WE GET INTO A MILL SEASON, THEN THOSE ISSUES ARE WEAPONIZED. FOR EXAMPLE, WE JUST RESURFACED BETTY'S ROAD BETWEEN HURON PARKWAY AND EARHART. I RECEIVED A NUMBER OF CALLS BECAUSE PEOPLE WANTED TO KNOW, WHERE'S THE SIDEWALK? IF WE HAVE COMPLETE STREETS, WE NEED SIDEWALKS ON THAT STREET, AND, OF COURSE, THAT'S NOT PRACTICAL, AND THERE ARE MANY REASONS WHY WE DIDN'T DO IT AT THIS TIME, INCLUDING TOWNSHIP ISLANDS BUT WE NEED SAFE PASSAGE. WE NEED A SHOULDER OF 6 FEET. I HOPE WE CAN FOCUS ON OUR COMMUNICATION AND WHEN WE DO PASS A NEW RESOLUTION OR ORDINANCE, THINK ABOUT HOW WE ARE GOING TO COMMUNICATE IT AND THINK ABOUT HOW IT WILL FIT WITH OUR EXISTING RESOLUTIONS. THANK YOU.
00:31:43.525: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. COUNCILMEMBER RAM LAW.
00:31:48.830: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU AND GOOD EVENING. I WANTED TO REPORT OUT THAT I MET WITH COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS AND OTHERS FROM THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH AAPD, ANN ARBOR FIRE DEPARTMENT AND OTHERS THIS AFTERNOON TO TALK ABOUT THE SITUATION AT LIBERTY PLAZA. I APPRECIATE MR. DOHONEY AND OTHERS WITHIN CITY HALL WHO HELPED PUT IT TOGETHER AND IT WILL BE COMING BACK TO US AS A GROUP IN A FEW WEEKS TO HEAR WHAT CAN BE DONE IN THE SHORT TERM AND WHAT CAN BE DONE IN THE LONG TERM. WE HAD A GOOD DISCUSSION WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND NEARBY TENANTS. OPTIES.PLE WHO MANE WAS MELEARHAT THERE'S AN ACUTE SAFETY ISSUE GOING ON IN OUR PARK. AND SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN KEEP THE OWE MIAMIMENT GOING AND ADDRESS SAFETY CONCERNS THAT ARE REAL. FURTHER. ONGOING DELAY LIBERTY STREET WATER MAIN. IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S ALMOST COMPLETE. THIS LOOKS LIKE THERE'S SOME CEMENT THAT NEEDS TO BE PUT DOWN. I KNOW THE NEIGHBORHOOD WOULD BE EAGER TO GET THAT BACK. THERE'S MANY NEARBY SCHOOLS AND THAT'S A VERY HEAVILY TRAFFICKED INTERSECTION THAT'S BEEN OUT OF COMMISSION FOR QUITE SOMETIME. SO RELIEF IS ON THE WAY, AND I HOPE BY THE WEEKEND OR THIS TIME NEXT WEEK, IT'S FULLY OPENED. THANK YOU.
00:33:41.476: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER SONG.
00:33:42.978: >> Councilmember Song: I'M HAPPY FOR PEOPLE TO CALL ON BEHALF OF SOCIAL SERVICE AGENCIES. WE'VE BEEN HAVING LONG DISCUSSIONS WITH FOLKS. A LOT OF NONPROFITS BEGIN THEIR FISCAL YEAR IN JULY AND NOT HAVING A SENSE OF BEING ABLE TO TRACK TIMING AND POTENTIAL FUNDING HAS PUT OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS AT RISK. I KNOW OUR STAFF AND COUNTY, THE COUNTY FOLKS ARE WORKING HARD ON THIS AND I'M REALLY HAPPY TO HEAR THAT THERE WILL BE A RESOLUTION COMING FORWARD NEXT MONTH SO WE CAN SEE WHERE WE CAN EXTEND THESE CONTRACTS AND MAKE SURE THE VULNERABLE FOLKS ARE TAKEN CARE OF. I ENCOURAGE OUR FELLOW COUNCILMEMBERS TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHO DOES THIS WORK ON A DAILY BASIS. WE HAVE H.U.D. WE HAVE OZONE FOR HOMELESS TEAMS AND WE HAVE A VARIETY OF FOLKS WHO ARE RAPID REHOUSING FOLKS WOULD WOULD NORMALLY BE OUT ON THE STREETS. THEY ARE STRUGGLING BECAUSE A LOT OF THEM ARE NOT BEING ABLE TO FUND RAISE EVEN AT THE PREPANDEMIC LEVEL. I ENCOURAGE FOLKS TO REACH OUT AND DO WHAT YOU CAN. ANOTHER UPDATE IS COUNTY COMMISSIONER, ANDY LaBAR IS EXTENDING THE PILOT ON CHILD CARE. THIS' AN APPLICATION GOING ON WHERE THE CHILD CARE NETWORK CAN PARTICIPATE IN A TRISHARE PROGRAM WHERE EMPLOYEES CAN GET REIMBURSED FOR THE REMAINING CHILD CARE PROGRAMS. THERE'S -- WE KNOW HOW THE CHILD CARE CRISIS HAS BEEN AFFECTING ALL SECTORS IN ANN ARBOR. IF YOU WOULD CONSIDER PARTICIPATING IN THIS, I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONTACT ANDY LaBAR. IT'S DUE ON WEDNESDAY. SO CONTACTING ANDY LaBAR MEANS BETWEEN NOW AND END OF DAY TUESDAY. BUT CLEARLY THIS CONVERSATION WILL BE ONGOING. ALL RIGHT. THANKS.
00:35:43.131: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
00:35:44.199: >> Councilmember Grand: I DON'T HAVE TOO MUCH TO ADD TO WHAT COUNCILMEMBER SONG JUST SAID BUT I WANT TO COMMUNITY IN REALLY CLEAR LANGUAGE, I HAD SOME GREAT CONVERSATIONS WITH DIRECTORS OF SOME OF OUR SAFETY NET PROVIDERS TODAY, WHO WERE RIGHTLY IN QUITE A PANIC THINKING ABOUT TRYING TO RECOGNIPROVIDE THESE CRITICAL SS DURING A PANDEMIC AND IN THE WINTER AND NOT KNOWING IF THEY WILL HAVE FUNDING. WHILE I'M ONE OF 11, I WILL DO MY BEST TO WORK WITH STAFF AND OUR PARTNERS AT THE COUNTY COMMISSION TO ENSURE THAT THIS FUNDING IS MAINTAINED SO THERE'S SOME STABILITY OVER THE NEXT SIX MONTHS AS WE MAKE THIS TRANSITION. I WON'T SPEAK FOR THOSE AT THE TABLE. I DO NOT WANT TO SEE ANYONE OUT ON THE STREET IN THE COLD. AND I CAN'T THINK THOSE I SPOKE WITH TODAY AND THOSE WHO ARE DOING THIS CRITICAL WORK FOR WHAT THEY DO, AND FOR WHAT THEIR STAFF DO, I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE THAT STABILITY SO YOU CAN CONTINUE TO HAVE YOUR EXCELLENT PEOPLE DO THEIR GOOD WORK IN OUR COMMUNITY. SO PLEASE BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR THAT RESOLUTION THE FIRST MEETING IN DECEMBER THAT I KNOW STAFF IS WORKING HARD ON. HOPEFULLY WE WILL HAVE OUR SUPPORT FROM THE COUNTY AS WELL. THANKS SO MUCH.
00:37:23.431: >> Mayor Taylor: ARE THERE FURTHER COMMUNICATIONS FROM COUNCIL? AS TO THE FAMILIARITIONS WOULD LIKE TO RECOMMEND, THE LOCAL OFFICERS COMPENSATION COMMISSION, ELIZABETH JENOVICH. MOVED BY BRIGGS AND SECONDED BY RADINA. DISCONSCIOUS? -- DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED WITH 11 COUNCILMEMBERS PRESENT ALL VOTING IN THE AFFIRMATIVE THUS SATISFYING THE EIGHT VOTE REQUIREMENT. I HAVE MYSELF A COMMUNICATION. WE HAVE A CLIMATE EMERGENCY THAT WE DECLARED AND THAT IS A MORAL OBLIGATION TO REDUCE CARBON IN OUR COMMUNITY. AND TO DATE, WE HAVE NOT DONE ENOUGH, BUT WE DO HAVE A PLAN. THAT PLAN IS A2ZERO, IT'S A PLAN ADOPTED UNANIMOUSLY BY COUNCIL TO TRANSFORM OUR COMMUNITY TO CARBON NEUTRALITY IN A WAY THAT'S EQUITABLE, URGENT AND EFFECTIVE BY THE YEAR 2030: IT'S A PLAN TO IMPROVE BASE I CAN SERVICES AND ENHANCE THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR EVERYONE IN ANN ARBOR TODAY. IT'S CLEAN, RELIABLE, AFFORDABLE LOCAL ELECTRICITY, A DRIVE TO ZERO WASTE THROUGH YEAR ROUND COMPOSTING AND EXPANDED RECYCLING, WEATHERIZATION PROGRAM IN HOMES AND BUSINESSES TO INCREASE COMFORT. MILES OF NEW BIKEWAYS AND PEDESTRIAN INFRASTRUCTURE, NEIGHBORHOOD RESILIENCY HUBS AND AGGRESSIVE E.V. SUPPORT AND THOUSANDS OF TREES. BUT WE DO NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL. AND THAT'S WHY I'M PROUD AND INCREDIBLY EXCITED TO BRING FORWARD ON DECEMBER 6th THE COMMUNITY CLIMATE ACTION MILLAGE. A ONE MILL, 20-YEAR MILLAGE TO RAISE THE FUNDS NECESSARY FOR EVERYONE IN ANN ARBOR TO ENJOY THE SAFETY, COMFORT, AFFORDABLE AND MORAL BENEFITS OF A CARBON NEUTRAL COMMUNITY. THE COMMUNITY CLIMATE ACTION MILLAGE WILL COST THE HOMEOWNER $4 A WEEK BUT THE BENEFITS THEY WILL RECEIVE WILL BE TRUE VALUE FOR THE MONEY. CITYWIDE PROGRAMS TO REDUCE ENERGY COSTS, INCREASE COMFORT AND SAFETY, IMPROVE LIVES TODAY. EVERY PERSON ALIVE NOW IS GOING TO SPEND MORE DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE. THAT IS A FACT. THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THAT NEW SPENDING WILL BE AN INVESTMENT IN OUR COMMON FUTURE OR WILL THAT NEW SPENDING BLOAT TENFOLD IN A FURTHER DEGRADED WORLD? IN ANN ARBOR WE BELIEVE IN SCIENCE AND VALUE FOR THE MONEY. WE BELIEVE IN COMMON ACTION FOR A COMMON PURPOSE. AND THAT'S WHY I'M CONFIDENT THAT ANN ARBOR WILL SUPPORT THE COMMUNITY CLIMATE ACTION MILLAGE IN MAY 2022, TO IMPROVE OUR BASIC SERVICES AND ENHANCE QUALITY OF LIFE, ACHIEVE EQUITABLE, AFFORDABLE, COMMUNITY-WIDE CARBON NEUTRALITY. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THE CONVERSATION. WE HAVE BEFORE US THE CONTENT C. MOVED BY GRISWOLD AND SECONDED BY DISCH. DISCUSSION OF THE CONSENT AGENDA. COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
00:40:23.745: >> Councilmember Nelson: THANK YOU. I WOULD LIKE TO PULL CA-2 AND CA-3.
00:40:35.456: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE CONSENT AGENDA? ALL IN FA FAVOR KOON SENT AGENDA WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CA-2 AND CA-3, PLEASE SAY AYE. OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED WITH 11 COUNCILMEMBERS BEING PRESENT, US THIS SATISFYING THE EIGHT VOTE REQUIREMENT WITH RESPECT TO CA-9. CA-2, RESOLUTION TO AWARD A CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT FOR GALVANIZED WATER SERVICES LINE REPLACEMENTS TO SWT EXCARBON NEUTRALITY RATING IN THE AMOUNT OF $1,013,116.15, PER YEAR FOR A PERIOD OF TWO YEARS FOR THE TOTAL OF 2,026,223.30. MOVED BY NELSON AND SECONDED BY RADINA.
00:41:22.337: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FOR STAFF. A RESIDENT REACHED OUT TO ME, WITH THEIR OWN ESTIMATE THAT THE TOTAL COST OF THIS PROJECT IS LIKELY TO REACH $19 MILLION, AND I'M JUST CURIOUS IF -- I WANTED TO HEAR A RESPONSE TO THAT. I APPRECIATE THAT WE WERE OBLIGATED TO TAKE CARE OF 5% A YEAR DO. WE HAVE AN ESTIMATED TIMELINE OF WHEN THIS WOULD BE ACHIEVED LIKE THE WHOLE OF REPLACING ALL OF THESE GALVANIZED LINES?
00:42:05.780: >> AS YOU HAVE SAID, WE ARE REQUIRED TO DO THESE. WE ARE PROCEEDING AT SLIGHTLY MORE THAN THE 5% PER YEAR, WHICH WOULD BE A 20-YEAR TIME PERIOD. WE HAVE NOT FULLY COMPLETED OUR INVENTORY YET TO KNOW WHETHER WE ARE -- WHAT OUR EXACT NUMBER OF THESE TO BE DONE, BUT, YES, IT IS APPROXIMATELY $1 MILLION A YEAR AS WE TAKE THESE ON.
00:42:36.377: >> Councilmember Nelson: OKAY.
00:42:37.278: >> AND IT'S UNFUNDED. IT HAS TO COME OUT OF RATEPAYER DOLLARS, CURRENTLY.
00:42:42.017: >> Councilmember Nelson:  ALL RIGHT. THANKS.
00:42:49.457: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? OPPOSED? CA-2 IS APPROVED. RESOLUTION TO SUPPORT A TRANSPORTATION ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FUNDS CATEGORY A GRANT OF RESEARCH PARK DRIVE. MOVED BY NELSON AND SECONDED BY HAYNER. COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
00:43:11.646: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I WAS DIGGING A LITTLE DEEPER ON THESE NUMBERS. I NOTE THIS IS ALSO IN WARD 4. IF THE TOTAL -- I APPRECIATE THAT THIS IS QUITE A LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY TO GET AS A GRANT, WHICH IS WONDERFUL. BUT THE COST TO THE CITY IS ANTICIPATED TO BE ALMOST $1 MILLION ALSO AND I WAS JUST CURIOUS, I'M LOOKING NOTHING MY BUDGET. IT LOOKS LIKE THE STREET BRIDGE AND SIDEWALK MILLAGE IN '22 AND '23 WILL BE LIKE $16 MILLION, 17 # MILLION DOLLARS. DO I HAVE THOSE NUMBERS RIGHT? AM I READING CORRECTLY IN THE BUDGET? MAYBE YOU DON'T KNOW OFF THE TOP OF YOUR HEAD HOW MUCH MONEY THAT IS. $1 MILLION RELATIVE TO THE -- I WAS CURIOUS IF YOU HAD AN IDEA OF WHAT THIS IS LIKELY TO DISPLAY IN THE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS PROJECT.
00:44:04.999: >> NICK, YOU ARE ON MUTE. YES.
00:44:06.567: >> I THINK AS FAR AS THE NUMBERS, I THINK THINK THE STREET, BRIDGE AND SIDEWALK NUMBERS COME TO ABOUT $3 MILLION $13 MILLION A YEAR IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY. IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH THIS WOULD REPLACE, I DON'T KNOW THAT YET. THIS PROJECT IS IN THE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PLAN B AT AN OUTER YEAR. WE WOULD HAVE TO MOVE IT FORWARD AND PROBABLY JUST SHIFT SOTHG BACK YEA I N'T KNOWXACTLY WHATHAT WOULD BE RIGHT NOW. WE WOULD WAIT UNTIL WE SEE IF WE GOT THE GRANT BEFORE DOING THAT.
00:44:43.538: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I GUESS MY OTHER QUESTION WAS: HOW MANY PROBLEMS OTHER THAN SARTORIOS GOING TO BE HELPED BY THAT IMPROVED DRIVE?
00:44:53.614: >> I BELIEVE THERE'S ABOUT 30 OR 40 PROPERTIES, ALTHOUGH THEY ARE NOT ALL DEVELOPED ON RESEARCH PARK DRIVE. YEAH, I COUNTED THEM RECENTLY. I THINK THAT'S ABOUT RIGHT.
00:45:07.494: >> Councilmember Nelson: OKAY. ALL RIGHT. I MEAN, I GUESS -- YEAH. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU.
00:45:14.836: >> THE NEED IS THERE. THE PAVEMENT CONDITION IS POOR AND THUS IT'S IN THE C.I.P. FOR A FUTURE PROJECT.
00:45:28.916: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
00:45:31.452: >> Councilmember Hayner:  JUST A QUICK FOLLOW-UP. I ASSUME THAT THIS GRANT HAS SOME TYPE OF SUNSET ON THE SPENDING OF IT. THAT'S WHY WE WANT TO MOVE THIS PROJECT FORWARD. IT'S NOT THAT IT'S JUST A TERRIBLE LOOP THROUGH THERE. IT'S BEYOND THE NEED OF THIS SINGLE PERSON WHO IS GOING TO HELP US -- OR SINGLE CORPORATION THAT'S GOING TO HYPOS PLY FOR THIS GRANT, LIKE, WE HAVE TO SPEND IT RIGHT AWAY; IS THAT CORRECT?
00:45:56.544: >> WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN THE GRANT, OBVIOUSLY. ONCE WE GET IT, THERE'S A LIMITED AMOUNT TO SPEND IT IN. I BELIEVE IT'S WITHIN TWO YEARS.
00:46:16.330: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I SHARE THE CONCERN ABOUT THE DISPLACEMENT OF PROJECTS. I KNOW THERE'S A BIG BOOM GOING ON OUT THERE. I HAVE BEEN DOING SOME WORK ON MORGAN ROAD. AND THERE'S A BIG PUSH TO GET THIS AREA GOING AGAIN AND IT'S APPROPRIATE, BUT, IT ALSO HAS THE PERCEPTION THAT IT'S A BIT OF A FAVORITISM AS WE START SHUFFLING PROJECTS AROUND. I GUESS WE WILL DEAL WITH THE SHUFFLES WHEN AND IF IT BECOMES NECESSARY. THANK YOU.
00:46:48.663: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
00:46:49.596: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I APPRECIATE STAFF BEING HERE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. AND SO I WILL HAVE ONE. HOW OFTEN DO WE GET THIS TYPE OF GRANT? WHEN WAS THE LAST ONE? I APOLOGIZE, I DIDN'T SPIT IT AS AN AJEN -- SUBMIT IT AS AN AGENDA QUESTION. IT SEEMS TO BE AN UNUSUAL OPPORTUNITY. FOR US, BUT NICK, YOU HAVE BEEN WITH US FOR A LONG, LONG TIME. MAYBE YOU WOULD KNOW HOW OFTEN ONE OF THESE COME AROUND.
00:47:14.622: >> NOT VERY OFTEN. I HAVE BEEN AT THE CITY FOR 15 YEARS AND THIS IS FIRST ONE I HAVE EVER DONE. IT'S A VERY UNUSUAL OPPORTUNITY THAT HAS COME IN FRONT OF US, AND WE ARE -- OUR THINKING WAS TAKING THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET AN EXTRA $1.6 MILLION TO INVEST IN OUR ROAD NETWORK, IS PROBABLY WORTH SHUFFLING A LITTLE BIT.
00:47:35.643: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  AND WHAT WAS THE CASE HERE THAT MADE THIS POSSIBLE, AT LEAST, YOU KNOW, FOR US TO DISCUSS IT? WHAT CONDITIONS ARE THERE THAT HAVEN'T BEEN HERE FOR THE LAST 15 YEARS.
00:48:00.934: >> I'M LEARNING ABOUT THE PROCESS, AS I PUT THIS GRANT TOGETHER. MY UNDERSTANDING IS IT'S CONNECTED TO A SPECIFIC DEVELOPMENT OR A DEVELOPMENT OR DEVELOPMENTS. AND I'M NOT SURE THE DETAILS OF HOW IT GENERATES BUT THE -- WE WERE INITIALLY APPROACHED BY SPARK, COMING THROUGH WORKING WITH THE DEVELOPMENT AND I BELIEVE THE GENESIS OF IT WAS IT WAS MAKING -- THE RESURFACING OF THIS ROAD WAS HELPING IT MAKE MORE ATTRACTIVE TO BRING THIS DEVELOPMENT TO THE AREA. AND THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THE TDEF GRANTS FROM THE STATE SPECIFICALLY.
00:48:45.880: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE TO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS. WHAT YOU LEARN AND WHAT YOU LEARN MORE IMPORTANTLY WILL HELP US BE MORE WATCHFUL FOR THESE TYPE OF OPPORTUNITIES IF THEY DO PRESENT THEMSELVES. I WOULD ASK QUESTIONS, YOU KNOW, ON OUR CLIMATE NEUTRALITY GOALS HERE, WE TALK ABOUT GOING WITH LESS INDUCED DEMAND FOR TRAFFIC AND SUCH, BUT WE ARE PAVING ROADS HERE THAT WILL DO, PERHAPS JUST THE OPPOSITE, BUT THAT IS JUST A SIDEBAR. THANK YOU.
00:49:34.495: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. I WANT TO SAY BRIEFLY, IT'S BEEN SUGGESTED, THE WORD "FAVORITISM." IT CONNOTES BAD ACTIONS AND IT CONNOTES SOMETHING THAT IS OUTSIDE OF THE USUAL PROCESS IN A WAY THAT IS -- THAT IS NOT CORRECT AND INTRUST. AND I JUST WANT TO STATE CLEARLY THAT THAT'S NOT THE CASE HERE. WHAT WE HAVE IS STAFF DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE SAVING ANN ARBOR TAXPAYER MONIES BY FINDING A GRANT AND APPLYING IT, APPLYING FOR IT IN AN EFFORT TO IMPROVE THE ROADS UTILIZING STATE RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR THE PURPOSE WHICH IS AN ENTIRELY RIGHT AND PROPER THING TO DO. COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
00:50:34.955: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WILL BE VOTING FOR THIS. LARGE BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS ARE MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE THAN AT ADVY THAN NEIGHBORHOODS AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET SOME FEDERAL FUNDS TO ADDRESS OUR NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS THAT ARE IN EXTREMELY POOR CONDITION. SO IT'S ALWAYS A BALANCING ACT. AGAIN, I WILL VOTE FOR THIS, BUT I HOPE THAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT NEIGHBORHOODS CANNOT ADVOCATE AS EFFECTIVELY AND SO WE AS COUNCILMEMBERS NEED TO STAND UP FOR THEM. THANK YOU.
00:51:09.223: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
00:51:10.925: >> Councilmember Hayner: YEAH, I WANTED TO GENTLY PROTEST YOUR ANALYSIS OF MY CHOICE OF WORDS. I WASN'T SUGGESTING ANY KIND OF MALFEASANCE ON THE PART OF CITY OR THE STATE OR STAFF, JUST PASSING ALONG WHAT I OFTEN HEAR WHEN PROJECTS GET BUMPED, WHEN LARGE EMPLOYERS COME TO TOWN, PEOPLE GET CONCERNED THAT THEY HAVE PRIORITIZATION OVER MATTERS, PERHAPS PRIORITIZATION WAS A BETTER WORD TO USE. FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? HE OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. WE NOW COME TO PUBLIC HEARING.

00:54:20.581: >> Clerk Beaudry: MATT WILL, DID YOU HAVE A COMMENT? CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER 111, DO YOU STILL HAVE A COMMENT?
00:54:36.731: >> SORRY, NOT FOR THIS ITEM.
00:54:40.801: >> Clerk Beaudry: THANK YOU. MAYOR YOR, I DON'T SEE ANY CALLS WITH THEIR HANDS UP FOR THIS ITEM.
00:54:51.678: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. PUBLIC HEARING NUMBER TWO, AN ORDINANCE TO ADD CHAPTER 74 TO TITLE VI OF THE CODE OF THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR WHICH SHALL BE ENTITLED “GENERAL HEALTH” AND TO ADD SECTIONS 6:650-6:653 (SANITATION SUPPLIES IN PUBLIC RESTROOMS). IS THERE ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING?
00:55:13.033: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER 111.
00:55:15.302: >> I HAD THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY. MY NAME IS QUINN. I USE THEY/THEM PRONOUNS AND I'M THE STUDENT PROJECT MANAGER FOR EMU, CHANGING THE CYCLE THAT PROVIDES FREE PERIOD PRODUCTS THROUGH DISPENSERS IN EASTERN MICHIGAN UNIVERSITY'S CAMPUS. AS A NONBINARY PERSON. I WANTED TO THANK COUNCILMEMBER RADINA, THAT NOT A ALL PEOPLE WO MENSTRUATE OR WOMEN. WE FOUND THAT EMU CHANGING THE CYCLE LEARNS THAT AFTER 1 IN 10 WOMEN ARE ABLE TO AFFORD PERIOD PRODUCTS AND ADDITIONAL 1.2 ARE OCCASIONALLY UNABLE TO AFFORD THESE PROJECTS. THEY ARE FORCED TO DECIDE BETWEEN BUYING FOOD AND TEXTBOOKS AND BUYING TAMPAX. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THESE NUMBERS ARE FROM BEFORE THE PANDEMIC. PERIOD POVERTY IS AFFECTING ALL AGES, GENDERS AND RACES CAN STRUGGLE TOFFORD TSE PRODUCTS ESPECLLY DURING THE TIME LIKE THE PANDEMIC. SOME WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE INCREASING USE OF THEIR BATHROOMS THESE PRODUCTS WERE PROVIDED. MORE SHOWERING AND SHELTERING RESOURCES. NO ONE IS CHOOSING TO BATHE IN A RESTAURANT BATHROOM IF THEY HAVE OTHER OPTIONS. PROVIDING FREE PERIOD PRODUCTS CANNOT WAIT UNTIL THAT HAPPENS. IT'S NEEDED NOW BY THOSE EXPERIENCING PERIOD POVERTY RIGHT NOW. PROVIDING FEE PERIOD PRODUCTS WON'T JUST HELP PEOPLE WHO CAN'T AFFORD THEM, BUT ALSO PAYING CUSTOMERS TO THESE BUSINESSES. ONE SURVEY FOUND THAT 80% OF PEOPLE WHO MENSTRUATE GOT THEIR PERIOD IN A PUBLIC PLACE WHEN THEY DIDN'T HAVE SUPPLIES WITH THEM. IF THEY DON'T WANT TELEPHONE WAH OUT. HAVING PADS AND TAMPONS WILL NOT COST MUCH BUT IT WILL MAKE IT MORE INNOOSIVE AND WELCOMING. PLEASE VOTE YES, SIR ON THIS ORDINANCE TO ENSURE THAT THESE NECESSARY PRODUCTS WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR ALL PEOPLE WHO NEED THEM. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME.
00:57:41.715: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER 865. PRESS STAR SIX TO UNMUTE YOUR PHONE IF YOU HAVE A COMMENT.
00:57:48.589: >> GO AHEAD.
00:57:49.456: >> HI, MY NAME IS NANCY KRAMER, I WOULD JUST LIKE TO REITERATE ALL THE POINTS THAT OUR PREVIOUS SPEAKER MADE ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR TOPIC. THIS IS A AN ISSUE THAT I HAVE BEEN ADVOCATING FOR SINCE THE FIRST TIME I WENT INTO THE RESTROOM AT APPLE'S CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS IN 1982 AND I SAW TAMPONS AND PADS LAYING ON THE COUNTER  APPLE'S CORPORATE HHEADQUARTERS AN I THOUGHT WHY S EVERY REST ROOM NOT LIKE THIS. A WOMAN NEEDS TO TAKE CARE OAR ANY MENSTRUATING PERSON NEEDS ACCESS TO THESE ITEMS IN ORDER TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR NORMAL BODILY FUNCTIONS. I HAVE BEEN ADVOCATING FOR THIS SINCE 1982. I HAVE ADVOCATES FOR IT IN SCHOOLS. I HAVE A NONPROFIT AROUND THIS. I HAVE ADVOCATE FOR BUSINESSES. I INSTITUTED POLICIES IN MY OWN BUSINESS, AND I HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN ABLE TO ADVOCATE THAT MY CURRENT EMPLOYER IBM INSTITUTE THIS POLICY AROUND THE WORLD FOR OUR 350 ASSOCIATES AND 197 COUNTRIES. MENSTRUAL SUPPORT IN ALL RESTROOMS FOR ANYONE WHO MAY NEED THEM IS A PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE. IT IS WHAT IS RIGHT. IT IS WHAT IS GOING TO PROVIDE EQUALITY. NO ONE SHOULD BE FACED WITH THE CONSEQUENCES OF HAVING AN UNEXPECTED START TO A MENSTRUAL CYCLE. THE RESULTS CAN BE HUMILIATING AND THE CONSEQUENCES ARE SO INCREDIBLY NEGATIVE. I'M SO HAPPY TO BE HERE AT THIS COUNCIL MEETING AND SAY IT'S VERY HEART INTO GO ME, SOMEBODY WHO HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON THIS FOR A VERY LONG TIME THAT ANN ARBOR WOULD BE ONE OF THE FIRST CITIES TO INSTITUTE THIS AT THIS LEVEL AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS, AND I HOPE THAT THIS MEASURE PASSES. SO THANK YOU SO MUCH.
00:59:50.510: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING?
01:00:20.107: >> Clerk Beaudry: I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER CALLERS AT THIS TIME.
01:00:22.876: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. SEEING NO ONE, THIS PUBLIC HEARING IS CLOSED. PUBLIC HEARING NUMBER THREE. RESOLUTION TO APPROVE GRACE BIBLE CHURCH SITE PLAN, 1300 SOUTH MAPLE ROAD. IS THERE ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING?
01:00:48.568: >> Clerk Beaudry: MAYOR YORK SEE ANY CALLERS -- I DON'T SEE ANY CALLERS WITH THEIR HANDS UP FOR THIS HEARING.
01:01:00.347: >> Mayor Taylor: SEEING NO ONE, THIS PUBLIC HEARING IS CLOSED. WE HAVE BEFORE US THE REGULAR MEETING MINUTES OF NOVEMBER 1, 2021. MOVED BY RAMLAWI AND SECONDED BY GRAND. ALL IN FAVOR? OPPOSED? THIS THEY ARE PASSED. B-1, AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND CHAPTER 55 (ZONING), REZONING OF 1.24 ACRES FROM TWP (TOWNSHIP DISTRICT) TO R2A (TWO-FAMILY DISTRICT), ISSA PROPERTY, 201 SCIO CHURCH. MOVED BY COUNCIL MEMBER DISCH, SECONDED BY NELSON. DISCUSSION, PLEASE, OF B-1. ALL IN FAVOR? OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. B-2, AN ORDINANCE TO ADD CHAPTER 74 TO TITLE VI OF THE CODE OF THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR WHICH SHALL BE ENTITLED “GENERAL HEALTH” AND TO ADD SECTIONS 6:650-6:653 (SANITATION SUPPLIES IN PUBLIC RESTROOMS). MOVED BY EYER AND SECONDED BY BRIGGS. DISCUSSION OF B-2. I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT I'M DELIGHTED IT IS BEING BROUGHT FORWARD AND WE WILL BE VOTING ON IT AND I BELIEVE PASSING IT TONIGHT. IF YOU HAVE A PUBLIC REST ROOM WHO WILL USE THE TOILET AND THERE SHOULD BE TOILET PAPER AVAILABLE FOR ALL. IF YOU HAVE A PUBLIC RESTROOM, THERE WILL BE PEOPLE WHO WILL WANT TO WASH THEIR HANDS AND THERE SHOULD BE SOAP AND PAPER TOWELS AVAILABLE FOR ALL. AND IF YOU HAVE A PUBLIC RESTROOM, THERE SHOULD BE TAMPONS AND PADS AVAILABLE FOR ALL. THESE PRODUCTS SUPPORT BASIC HUMAN NEEDS AND IS LONG PAST TIME THAT WE AS A SOCIETY ACKNOWLEDGE AND RESPOND TO THAT REALITY. WE HAVE MET THESE NEEDS, OF COURSE, AS A GENERAL CULTURAL MATTER WITH TOILET PAPER AND TYPICALLY SOAP AND TOWELS BUT WE HAVE NOT MET THE NEED WITH RESPECT TO MENSTRUAL PRODUCTS. THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN GOOD IF THAT WAS THE CASE. AND SO THIS ORDINANCE IS A NECESSITY AND IT'S A LONG-TIME COMING. I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT I HAVE MENTIONED BEFORE THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A LONGER TIME COMING STILL IF A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT WHO KNOWS -- WHO KNOWS WHO SHE IS, HAD NOT COME TO ME A BIT AGO TO DISCUSS HER CONCERN THAT THE LESS PRIVILEGED IN ANN ARBOR HAD DIFFICULTY OBTAINING MENSTRUAL PRODUCTS. THAT CONVERSATION GOT ME THINKING AND SO AFTER SOME ADVANCES IN MENSTRUAL PRODUCT AVAILABILITY IN ILLINOIS, AND NEW YORK, AND SCOTLAND, I ASKED STAFF TO SEE IF WE COULD AFFECT THIS. PERIOD PRODUCTS ARE A NECESSITY FOR ANYONE WHO MENSTRUATES. ACCESS TO THESE ITEMS IS A MATTER OF PERSONAL DIGI DIGNITY. TOO MANY STRUGGLE IN ANN ARBOR TO OBTAIN THEM AND I'M JUST SO GLAD THAT WE ARE GOING TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT HERE TODAY. IT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO 100%. COUNCILMEMBER RADINA?
01:04:00.393: >> Councilmember Radina: THANKS, MAYOR AND I DON'T WANT TO SPEND TOO MUCH TIME REITERATE ALL THE EXCELLENT POINTS THAT YOU JUST MADE OR THOSE THAT WE DISCUSSED LAST WEEK. I WANTED TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO THANK YOU AGAIN AND MEMBERS OF STAFF FOR LEADING ON THIS AND ALSO FOR THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO CALLED IN, AND FOR THEIR WORK IN THE COMMUNITY ON THIS FOR YEARS AS WELL. SPECIFICALLY, DID I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE EMPHASIZED ONE OF THE CALLERS DURING PUBLIC HEARING REQUESTED THAT THIS NOT BE SPECIFIC TO ONLY FEMALE GENDERED BATHROOMS AND THAT IS NOT THE CASE. THIS IS REQUIRED FOR ALL RESTROOM FACILITIES AND SO WE ABSOLUTELY MADE THAT CASE DURING DRAFTING THIS AND I KNOW THAT THE MAYOR MADE SURE THAT THIS WAS AVAILABLE FOR ANYONE WHO MAY MENSTRUATE, NOT JUST IN WOMEN'S RESTROOMS. THANKS.
01:04:56.950: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS.
01:04:58.551: >> Councilmember Briggs: YEAH, THANK YOU. I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU AND THOSE WHO HAVE ADVOCATES FOR THIS ORDINANCE COMING FORWARD. I HAVE TO SAY, THIS IS ONE OF THE ORDINANCES THAT I HAVE FOUND TO BE A LEARNING PROCESS FOR MYSELF AS WELL, , DESPITE THE FT THAT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN A BIGGER PROPONENT OF THIS EARLIER ON. IT TOOK ME A LITTLE WHILE TO GET BEHIND WHY THIS WAS SO NECESSARY, I AP APPRECIATED TO E OPPORTUNITY TO READ AND CHALLENGE MY OWN ASSUMPTIONS. I AAPPRECIATE THE END TO PERIOD POVERTY AND THERE'S AN EQUITY THAT WE LEARN TO LIVE WITH. CERTAINLY EVERY WOMAN HAS EXPERIENCED THIS, AND YOU KNOW, ANYBODY WHO MENSTRUATES. DOES EVERY WOMAN HAS EXPERIENCED THAT HUE MAILIATING -- EXPERIENCED THAT HUMILIATING FEELING WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE THE SUPPLIES THAT THEY NEED AND I'M GLAD TO KNOW THAT OUR COMMUNITY IS GOING TO BE LEADING THIS FORWARD AND ENDING THAT EXPERIENCE IN OUR COMMUNITY.
01:06:16.896: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
01:06:18.698: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES, I HOPE THAT WE WILL GROW FROM THIS RESOLUTION, AND LOOK AT PUBLIC RESTROOMS IN THE DOWNTOWN AREA, BECAUSE I THINK THAT IS REALLY A HUMAN RIGHT, AND IT'S EMBARRASSING AS A MEMBER OF THE ANN ARBOR COMMUNITY, THAT WE DON'T HAVE PUBLIC REST RESTROOMS IN THE DON AREA. IT PUTS AN EXTRA BURDEN ON BUSINESSES IN THE DOWNTOWN AREA. YOP WHAT THE NEXT STEP IS. I DON'T KNOW IF A RESOLUTION IS NEEDED BUT WE DO NO N NEED TO HE PUBLIC RESTROOMS DOWNTOWN. THANK YOU.
01:07:05.545: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:07:06.346: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. I JUST WANTED TO TAKE A FEW MINUTES AND THANK THE CITY ATTORNEY JOHN RISER ON ALL THE WORK HE'S PUT INTO THIS. HE OUTLINED A LOT THAT HE DISCOVERED, LOOKING INTO THIS. IN FACT, WE WILL BE FIRST TSE IN AMERICA TO MANDATE THIS AND NOT JUST ONE BUT THE ONLY. SO I APPRECIATE THE WORK, AND THE BACKGROUND WAS GIVEN TO US REGARDING THIS, THE FINANCIAL IMPACTS IT WILL HAVE ON BUSINESSES AND THE DIFFERENCES -- AND ALL THE DIFFERENT PRODUCTS, AND SOME ARE REQUIRED ONLY FOR RESTAURANTS THAT GET INSPECTED BY THE COUNTY. SO ENFORCEMENT WILL BE A CHALLENGE. WE KNOW THAT. I DON'T THINK IT WILL BE SOMETHING THAT WILL BE ENFORCED LIKE MANY OTHER THINGS, BUT I SUPPOSE IT'S A NECESSITY -- IT'S NECESSARY WITH AN ORDINANCE LIKE THIS TO HAVE SOME SORT OF CONSEQNCE TO IT, BUT I D LIEVE AT IT HOPEFULLY WILL BE A SUE INTO THE DISCUSSION OF PUBLIC RESTROOMS. THIS WAS AN ARTICLE I HAVEN'T COMPLETED READING YET, THAT WAS SENT TO ME BY A FRIEND THAT TALKED ABOUT THE PROGRESSIVENESS OF PUBLIC RESTROOMS AT THE TURN OF THE LAST CENTURY, IN THE TEENS AND THE ROARING '20s, WHEN THOSE PUBLIC RESTROOMS IN CITIES WERE HALLMARK OF PROGRESSIVE POLITICAL MOVEMENT IN AMERICA. SO HOPEFULLY THIS AGAIN, BUILDS UPON THE DISCUSSIONS THAT WE HAD BEFORE. I REACHED OUT TO MR. DOHONEY ALREADY. I WILL FOLLOW BACK UP AFTER THIS MEETING, TO BEGIN DISCUSSIONS ON PUBLIC RESTROOMS AND PROVIDE THE BASIC HUMANITARIAN RIGHT FOR ALL PEOPLE, FOR SOMETHING THEY HAVE EVERY DAY OF THEIR LIFE, A NEED TO AND I THINK THE BURDEN IS TOO MUCH ON SMALL BUSINESSES TO ACCOMMODATE SO MUCH OF WHAT OUR GOVERNMENT FAILS TO DO AND THIS IS NOT GOING TO PUT PEOPLE OUT OF BUSINESS, BUT I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE NOTED THAT WE NEED TO HAVE OUR OWN PUBLIC RESTROOMS AS A MUNICIPALITY, AND NOT JUST PUNPUT RESPONSIBILITY ON EVERYBY ELSE, EXCEPT FOR OURSELVES WHEN IT COMES TO THESE BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS AND ISSUES THAT AFFECT US ALL. SO I WILL GO AS FAR AS TO ASK THE CLERK TO ADD ME AS A COSPONSOR TO THIS RESOLUTION, AND THE EFFORTS AND THE HOPES TO REALLY MAKE IT CLEAR WHERE I STAND, AND WHERE I WANT TO GO WITH THINGS. SO I WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A COSPONSOR. THANK YOU.
01:10:13.099: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
01:10:14.033: >> Councilmember Hayner:  REAL QUICKLY, I APPRECIATE MOVING THIS FORWARD AND SOMETIMES ONE THING BUILDS ON ANOTHER AND BY SUCH MEANS CAN WE WORK TOGETHER TO GET GOOD THINGS DONE FOR THE COMMUNITY. WE STARTED OFF A LITTLE CONVERSATION ABOUT PUBLIC RESTROOMS AND I WANT TO THANK STAFF FOR PROVIDING THE ANSWERS TO SOME OF THE RESEARCH THAT NEEDED TO BE DONE ON THAT BECAUSE, OF COURSE, WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF, YOU KNOW, PUBLIC RESTROOM LOCATIONS IN THE PARKS SYSTEM RIGHT NOW. AND SO I APPRECIATE SEEING THAT AS PART OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WENT OUT AROUND THIS ORDINANCE AND SO, YEAH, DEFINITELY THAT'S GOING TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD AND, YOU KNOW, WE WILL TAKE A LOOK AT IT. I HAD A FEW CALLS WITH SOME OF THE ATTORNEY STAFF ON THIS AND, YEAH, WE WILL MOVE THIS TO THE NEXT STAGE. I AGREE, IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY AND, YOU KNOW, WE TALK ABOUT THE COORDINATED FUNDING PANIC THAT HAS COME ACROSS OUR DESK TODAY AND OTHER THINGS IT'S ONE MORE THING WE CAN DO TO LOOK OUT FOR EVERYBODY. SO THANKS FOR BRINGING THIS EVERYBODY GIVING SOME INPUT ON A PUBLIC RESTROOM SITUATION GENERALLY. THANKS.
01:11:26.272: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER SONG?
01:11:29.142: >> Councilmember Song: I'M ENCOURAGED THAT THIS WORK IS HAPPENING AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL TOO. GRACE MAY OF NEW YORK HAD INTRODUCED LEGISLATION BACK IN MAY, HOPING TO ADVOCATE FOR STATES TO BE ABLE TO USE FEDERAL GRANT FUNDS TO USE FREE MENSTRUAL PRODUCTS IN SCHOOLS, FOR SHELTERS, COLLEGES, UNIVERSITIES, INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS, HOMELESS SHELTERS, HOPEFULLY, IF THIS PASSES, EMPLOYERS WITH 100 OR MORE BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE MENSTRUAL PRODUCTS. SO I SEE THAT WE HAVE GOT SOME WORK THAT WAS HAPPENING HERE AT THE STATE LEVEL TOO, GETTING RID OF THE TAXES ASSOCIATED WITH MENSTRUAL PRODUCTS AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT WORKING LOCALLY TO ALIGN OURSELVES WITH THE PROGRESSIVE WORK WHERE WE ARE ENCOURAGING LOCAL BUSINESS OWNERS TO INVEST IN DIGNITY. WE TALKED ABOUT MENSTRUATION. I REACHED OUT TO WOMEN LIKE MYSELF WHO LOST PREGNANCIES IN PUBLIC PLACES AND HAD TO RETURN TO WORK. SO THESE ARE -- IT IS A MATTER OF DIGNITY, AND NOT JUST POVERTY, PERIOD POVERTY. IT'S DIG KNITLY AND BEING ABLE TO RETURN -- DIGNITY AND BEING ABLE TO RETURN TO WORK DURING YOUR SHIFT AND CONTINUING WITH WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH THESE CHALLENGES. SO I HAVE SPOKEN TO LOCAL BUSINESSES WHO HAVE DONE THIS AHEAD OF THE CITY, HAVE DONE THIS -- THE LIBRARY HAS DONE THIS A YEAR IN ADVANCE OF THIS. SO I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT THIS IS NOT TOO MUCH OF A BURDEN LOCAL BUSINESSES GIVEN THE COST OF PERIOD PRODUCTS AND GIVEN THAT IF YOU HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE LIBRARY, EVEN WITH THE SCHOOLS WHO ARE PREPARING TO -- PREPARING TO HAVE THIS IN ALL THE BATHROOMS OVER THE HOLIDAY BREAK, IF THEY CAN DO THAT FOR A NUMBER OF BUILDINGS THROUGHOUT THE DISTRICT, I'M CONFIDENT THAT OUR SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS CAN FOLLOW SUIT AND SHOW REAL CARE FOR A SIZABLE NUMBER OF COMMUNITY MEMBERS. THANKS.
01:13:47.947: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ATTORNEY RISER WAS REFERENCED AND THAT DOES GIVE I GUESS FIRST OF ALL, I WOULD LIKE TO ADD MY THANKS MR. RISER FOR HIS WORK AND ALSO TO REFLECT THE OUTSTANDING WORK OF MS. BLAKE, FORMERLY OF THE OFFICE, WHO WAS THE FIRST PERSON INVOLVED IN DOING THIS -- WORKING ON THIS ORDINANCE BACK IN THE SPRING. FURTHER, I NOTE THAT THERE IS A SUGGESTED AMENDMENT IN COMMUNICATION THAT I -- THAT HAS BEEN DISTRIBUTED TO OTT GROUP AND I WILL BE GRATEFUL -- HOLD ON, PLEASE. THERE IS AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE AMENDMENT THAT WAS ORIGINALLY REQUESTED. I HAD DISTRIBUTED TO STAFF AND TO THE CLERK AND TO COUNCIL AMENDMENT WHICH I THINK IS BEING REQUESTED BY STAFF WHICH IF I INFER CORRECTLY WOULD NOT REQUIRE GOING BACK TO FIRST READING. THE AMENDMENT BEING IN ADDITION TO SECTION 6, 652, SECTION 2, WHICH WILL THEN THEREAFTER STATE A PROVISION OF THIS ORDINANCE SHALL NOT APPLY TO MOSQUES, TEMPLES, CHURCHES AND OTHER PLACES OF WORSHIP FOR WHOM COMPLIANCE WOULD CONFLICT WITH THE ENTERRITIES SINCERELY HELD REDUCED BELIEFS, PRACTICES OR OBSERVANCES. MAY I HAVE A MOTION? MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWILY AND SECONDED BY DISCH. IS THAT FRIENDLY TO THE BODY. FRIENDLY TO THE BODY. MR. REISER, THANK YOU. FURTHER DISCUSSION? I GUESS, I WILL JUST FOLLOW-UP AND SAY THAT I'M -- I STILL HAVE THE FLOOR. I'M GRATEFUL THAT, AGAIN, THE WORK THAT'S BEING DONE BY STAFF AS HAS BEEN NOTED. THIS IS TO OUR KNOWLEDGE THE FIRST OF THESE -- THE FIRST OF THIS SORT OF REQUIREMENT IN THE COUNTRY, AND IT'S MY EARNEST HOPE THAT OTHERS QUICKLY FOLLOW SUIT. COUNCILMEMBER SONG.
01:16:16.262: >> Councilmember Song: OUR LAST MEETING, I WAS ASKED TO BE A SPONSOR TO THIS RESOLUTION AND I DON'T SEE IT REFLECTED. MS. BEAUDRY, IF YOU COULD HELP ME. THANK YOU.
01:16:26.506: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
01:16:29.108: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANKS, MR. MAYOR. I I JUST WAS WONDERING WHAT -- A, I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THIS WHOLE THING. I APPRECIATE YOUR RESOLUTION. WAY WAS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHERE THAT WAS COMING FROM. I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THERE WAS SUCH A THING THAT A CHURCH OR A RELIGIOUS BELIEF THAT -- BECAUSE IT'S A DISTRIBUTION OF A PRODUCT OR -- I'M JUST NOT SURE WHERE THAT'S COMING FROM. I THINK IT'S FINE IF IT SEEMS APPROPRIATE, BUT I JUST NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING. I'M TRYING TO --
01:17:08.547: >> Mayor Taylor: THE REFERENCE IS IN MR. REISER'S MEMO.
01:17:12.618: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WILL TAKE A LOOK. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU.
01:17:20.226: >> Mayor Taylor: ALL IN FAVOR? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
01:17:23.229: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: PERHAPS FOR OUR VIEWING AUDIENCE AND OTHERS IF M MR. REISER IS COMFORTABLE IN ANSWERING THE AMENDMENT AND WHY IT WAS BROUGHT FORWARD.
01:17:40.846: >> YEAH, I HAD A LITTLE BIT OF A HARD TIME HEARING COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
01:17:46.652: >> Councilmember Hayner:  WHAT COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI JUST SAID. MAYBE IT'S A QUESTION THAT THE PUBLIC MIGHT ASK, WHY HE WOULD WOULD ADD THAT TO THE RESOLUTION, IF YOU CAN SAY.
01:17:57.063: >> WITHOUT GETTING TOO MUCH INTO THE LEGAL MEMO, DIFFERENT RELIGION AND CULTURES TREAT MENSTRUATION DIFFERENTLY AND THERE ARE SOMETIMES RELIGIOUS PREFERENCES FOR ONE TYPE OVER ANOTHER, AND IT MIGHT BE AGAINST THE RELIGION TO PROVIDE ONE TYPE OR THE OTHER. SO THE AMENDMENT THAT YOU HAVE KIND OF ALLOWS THE FREE EXERCISE OF RELIGION WHILE STILL MANDATING THE LAW GENERALLY. THE MOMENT RECENT AMENDMENT ALLOWS, YOU KNOW, THEM TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE PROVISIONS OF IT. THERE ARE PROBABLY NOT RELIGIONS AGAINST TOILET PAPER OR SOAP, BUT THERE ARE CERTAINLY PRESCRIPTIONS AGAINST ONE TYPE OF MENSTRUAL PRODUCT OVER THE OTHER, AND THAT'S THE GENESIS OF THE SUGGESTION FOR THAT AMENDMENT.
01:18:46.312: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  AND IF I COULD ADD TO THAT, THIS IS IN HOUSES OF WORSHIP SO THAT THE PROPERTIES, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE CONCONGREGATE, THAT'S -- THOSE ARE THE RESTROOMS THAT ARE -- ARE BEING DISCUSSED? SO YOU KNOW, I WILL JUST SAY THAT THAT IS A DISTINCTION. NOW, WHAT PEOPLE DO IN THEIR OWN HOMES AND EVERYWHERE ELSE IS DIFFERENT.
01:19:14.373: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION?
01:19:15.641: >> OTHER THAN MR. POSTEMA THINKS THAT THE -- MY BOSS THINKS FOR WHOM COMPLIANCE MAYBE SHOULD BE FOR WHICH COMPLIANCE. SO I WANT TO GET IT GRAMMATICALLY CORRECT.
01:19:27.820: >> Mayor Taylor: WE'LL COUNT THAT AS A SCRIVENER'S ERROR.
01:19:31.857: >> OKAY.
01:19:32.157: >> Mayor Taylor: OR MAYBE A SCRIVENER'S IMPROVEMENT. FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. C-1, AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND CHAPTER 55 (UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE), ZONING OF 32.6 ACRES FROM R3 (TOWNHOUSE DWELLING) TO R4B ULTIE-FAMI DWELLING), MILL CREETOWNHOMES ZONING, 30 CHSEA CIRCLE. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER DISCH. SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRAND. DISCUSSION, PLEASE, OF C-1. COUNCILMEMBER DISCH.
01:20:32.752: >> Councilmember Disch: AS JUST WANTED TO SAY A COUPLE. THINGS ABOUT THIS PROJECT. I'M SURE IT LEAPT OUT TO ALL OF YOU, BUT THIS IS AN INFILL PROJECT. THAT'S VERY EXCITING. WE DON'T SEE VERY MUCH OF THIS. AND THIS INFILL PROJECT, IF IT IS APPROVED WILL PROVIDE THREE 30-UNIT THREE-STORY BUILDINGS. AND IT WILL USE EXISTING UTILITIES TO ACHIEVE GREATER DENSITY AND IT WILL ALSO CREATE RELATIVE AFFORDABILITY, BOTH BY VIRTUE OF THE LOCATION OF THIS PROJECT, WHICH IS DEFINITELY NOT THE CENTER OF TOWN, AND THE SIZE OF THE APARTMENT PROJECTS. AND CURRENTLY MILL CREEK DEVELOPMENT HAS MOSTLY TWO BEDROOM TOWNHOMES A FEW ONE-BEDROOMS AND A COUPLE OF THREE-BEDROOMS. THE PROPOSAL HERE IS TO PROVIDE ONE BEDROOM APARTMENTS AND THERE IS AFFORDABILITY BUILT IN. THE PROJECT WILL BE SIGNIFICANTLY UPGRADING THE STORMWATER RETENTION MANAGEMENT. RIGHT NOW THERE'S NO NORM WATER TREATMENT, WHICH IS THE CASE ON SO MANY OF OUR PROPERTIES. AND SO THE DEVELOPER IS PROPOSAL TWO NEW UNDERGROUND CONTROL SYSTEMS. I HAVE TO DO THIS BECAUSE THEY ARE ON CLAYEY SOIL AND SO THEY CANNOT DO THE RELEASE THROUGH HUR STORM SYSTEM. THEY ARE -- THEY HAVE ADDED ADDITIONAL THINGS SINCE THE PLANNING COMMISSION SAW THIS PROPOSAL AND WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR THAT. AND THEN THEY HAVE, AS YOU KNOW, REQUESTED AND BEEN GRANTED A VARIANCE FROM THE E.V. ORDINANCE. AND IF PEOPLE HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT, ALTHOUGH, I THINK I HAVE ALL THE MATH RIGHT, I WOULD ASK STAFF IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE E.V. ORDINANCE. SO PLANNING COMMISSION WAS HAPPY TO SEE THIS. I'M DELIGHTED TO SEE IT COME TO COUNCIL AND I HOPE WE CAN PASS IT.
01:22:41.447: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
01:22:50.623: >> Councilmember Hayner: SORRY, I'M HAVING DIFFICULTY WITH MY ALTERNATIVE READING SCREEN HERE. SO THIS IS THE FIRST READING ON THIS REZONING OR THIS IS IT BECAUSE IT'S A REZONING AND SITE PLAN TOGETHER FOR US? THIS IS IT? CAN ANYBODY ANSWER THAT QUESTION?
01:23:16.248: >> Mayor Taylor: IT'S A FIRST READING.
01:23:17.449: >> Clerk Beaudry: IT'S A FIRST READING.
01:23:18.583: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WILL GET MY QUESTIONS IN ABOUT THE E.V.I. HAVE SOME CONCERNS AND CONSIDERATIONS ABOUT THAT. I KNOW PEOPLE REALLY -- REALLY ARE INTERESTED IN HAVING THAT BE INTEGRATED. CURIOUS CONSTITUENT OF MINE HAD POINTED SOMETHING OUT INTERESTING TO MINE. WHAT COUNCILWOMAN DISCH WAS SAYING THERE ARE SMALLER UNITS AND HAVE SOME AFFORDABILITY AND I THINK THERE'S A NEED FOR THESE MIX OF UNIT SIZES, NUMBER OF BEDROOMS IN UNITS ALL AROUND OUR CITY, AND SOMETHING THAT WAS INTERESTING, WAS THAT ONE OF THE THINGS -- THERE'S DIFFERENT WAYS TO LOOK AT THINGS ALWAYS AND WE CAN -- IT'S POSSIBLE WE NEED TO CONSIDER MORE PEOPLE IN THE SAME AMOUNT OF SPACE, RIGHT? AND SO WE HAVE SOMEBODY -- SOMEBODY WILL HAVE A BIG THREE OR FOUR BEDROOM HOUSE AND THERE'S ONE OR TWO PEOPLE LIVING IN THERE. I DON'T KNOW HOW WE CAN GET AROUND TO ENCOURAGING THAT KIND OF BEHAVIOR, BUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S A UNIQUELY AMERICAN TH TO BE BOUNCING AROUND A LOT TO HEAT. I WILL SUPPORT IT MOVING FORWARD.
01:24:28.854: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? I'M SORRY, COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:24:40.132: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: JUST REAL QUICK. FIRST READING, IT LOOKS VERY PROMISING AS MY COLLEAGUE STATED. THIS IS AN ATTRACTIVE INFILL PROJECT TO INCREASE DENSITY IN AREAS THAT AREN'T THE MOST CONGESTED ALREADY OR EXPENSIVE TO BUILD. REALLY HAS MANY OF THE FEATURES WE ARE LOOKING FOR AND HOPEFULLY, YOU NO HE, THIS PASSES AND WE HAVE MORE DISCUSSION ON IT AT SECOND READING, BUT NO BIG RED FLAGS ANYWHERE ABOUT THIS. AND I HOPE THAT THERE'S MORE PROJECTS LIKE THIS THAT WE CAN -- WE CAN SEE IN THE FUTURE, BUT THAT'S PROBABLY UNLIKEY THERE. THANK YOU.
01:25:25.077: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. ALL IN FAVOR. IT'S APPROVED. C-2. AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND CHAPTER 55 (UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE) REZONING OF 0.61 ACRES FROM PUD (PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT) TO PUD (PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT), CASA DOMINICKS DEVELOPMENT PUD ZONING AND SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS, 800, 812, 814 MONROE, 705 OAKLAND, 700, AND 706 TAPPAN. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRAND, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER RADINA DISCUSSION OF C-2. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:26:03.615: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. AGAIN, ANOTHER FIRST READING HERE, USUALLY DON'T HAVE OBJECTIONS WITH SUPPORTING THINGS TO SECOND READING. BUT IN THIS CASE, YOU HAVE STAFF RECOMMENDING DENIAL, 8-0. AND IT -- SINCE WE HAVE STAFF HERE, PERHAPS THEY CAN PARAPHRASE AND ARTICULATE IN THREE MINUTES OR SO, WHAT THEIR CERTAINS ARE, WHY THIS IS BEING RECOMMENDED FOR DENIAL. IT WOULD BE HARD PRESS FOR ME TO GO AGAINST SOMETHING THAT HAS SUCH A UNANIMOUS, YOU KNOW, RECOMMENDATION FROM STAFF. SO I APOLOGIZE, BUT IF IT'S AVAILABLE, IF I CAN HAVE AN EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OR SYNOPSIS OF WHY THAT'S THE CASE FOR THE REST OF THE US AND THE PUBLIC. SHOO SURE. GOOD EVENING, EVERYBODY. MATT KOWASKI. IT'S ONE OF OUR ORIGINAL PUDs IN THE CITY, HOWEVER, IN ABOUT -- I THINK 2009, THEY DID A MAJOR REVISION TO THE PUD ORDINANCE FOR THIS PROPERTY. THE WHOLE DOMINICK'S IS A CONGLOMERATE OF PROPERTIES WAS ALL BROUGHT TOGETHER UNDER OUR PUD ZONING AND AT THE TIME, THAT WAS THE MECHANISMS -- THEY WERE PLANNING SOME EXPANSIONS AND OTHER THINGS WITHIN THE CASA DOMINICK'S AREA AND THE PREVIOUS PUD DID NOT ALLOW CERTAIN EXPENSIONS. SO WHILE THEY WERE -- WHILE THE PLAN WAS THERE AGAIN FOR THOSE, THEY WENT IN -- WE HAD TO OPEN UP THE SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS WHICH ARE ZONING REGULATIONS FOR THIS PARTICULAR GROUP OF PROPERTIES. SO WITHIN THAT REGULATION, THIS IS PART OF WHAT'S REALLY INITIALLY COUNCIL AND THEN FINAL APPROVAL WAS -- THE PLANNING COMMISSION AND FINAL APPROVAL BY COUNCIL. BACK IN 2009, ONE THE BIG CONCERNS THROUGH THIS DEBATE WAS AGAIN, KIND OF A PUBLIC BENEFIT. PUD NEEDS TO PROVIDE A PUBLIC BENEFIT. WHILE IT'S A GREAT MIX OF USES, IT'S KIND OF CREATIVE, YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY LIKES THAT. THE PUBLIC BENEFITS ARE AREAS THAT THEY WERE LOOKING TO EXPAND UPON. ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT WAS NOTED AT THAT TIME, WAS PEDESTRIAN ACCESS. IT'S HEAVILY PEDESTRIAN ORIENTED AREA, WHERE A LOT OF TRAFFIC IN THAT AREA AND REALLY CONFLICTS, POTENTIAL CONFLICTS. AND SO PART TO MAKE IT MORE USER FRIENDLY TO MAKE IT MORE PEDESTRIAN FRIENDLY WAS LOOKING AT SOME OF THE CURB CUTS THAT SERVICE THIS SITE AND THEY COME IN AT DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE PROPERTY AND THERE ARE DIFFERENT BUILDINGS THAT ARE PART OF THIS, THE CONCERN WAS TRYING TO LIMIT POTENTIAL CONFLICT POINTS AND ELIMINATE SOME DRIVEWAYS AS A PART OF THE PUBLIC BENEFIT. SO THOSE WERE DEBATED AMONG PLANNING COMMISSION. ULTIMATELY CITY COUNCIL. SO THE SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS THAT WERE AGREED UPON IN 2009, WERE REGULATIONS THAT EFFECTIVELY REQUIRED THEM TO CLOSE, A CURB CULT, SO BASICALLY THE SITE PLAN WHEN THEY GO FORWARD WITH ANY KIND OF SITE PLAN THAT TRIGGERS ON THE PROPERTY. THEY ARE REQUIRED TO CLOSE CURB CUTS BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE ZONING DISTRICT NOW SAYS. THEY CAN HAVE A MAXIMUM OF TWO CURB CUTS FOR THAT PROPERTY. IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY WHICH CURB CULTS BUT IT SAYS TWO. AS PART OF -- WHEN PLANNING -- I'M TRYING TO GO A LITTLE BIT QUICKER THROUGH THIS, BUT THEN -- SO, AGAIN, SOME OF THE CURB CUTS. ONE CURB CUT IN QUESTION, WHICH IS WHAT WE ARE DEBATING NOW IS 700 TAPPAN WHICH ALLOWS A PARKING BETWEEN THE BUILDING AND MONROE AND THEN THAT'S PART OF IT AND THEN IT ALSO LEADS TO A PARKING SPACE BEHIND 700 TAPPAN. SO THAT WAS THE SPACE THAT PLANNING COMMISSION DEBATED ABOUT AND AGREED THAT WAS THE MOST LOGICAL TO BE REMOVED. IT'S FLOOR THE CORNER AND THE PATIOPATIO DOMINICK AND'S A LOTF PEDESTRIAN. AND WHEN 700 TAPPAN CAME IN AS A PROVISIONING CENTER, THEY ARE STILL REQUIRED -- WELL, THEY WERE AT THE TIME OF PROVISIONING CENTERS NOW REQUIRED SPECIAL EXCEPTION USES. AS PART OF THAT SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE IT HAS TO GO TO PLANNING COMMISSION WITH THE SITE PLAN. AS PART OF THE THAT PROVAL OF THAT SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE BACK IN 2010 -- I'M -- NEAR 2009 AS PART OF THE APPROVAL OF THAT REQUIRED THAT THAT CURB CUT BE CLOSED. SO THAT'S PART OF THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE WAS REMOVE AFL OFF THAT CURB CUT. THAT'S THE BASIS THAT STAFF -- AS OF WHERE WE SIT TODAY, THEY HAD A SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE THAT REQUIRES THAT CURB CUT TO BE REMOVED AND RESTORED, AND THE PUD ZONING REGULATIONS FOR THAT COMPLEX, REQUIRE A MAXIMUM OF TWO CURB CUTS WHICH IS NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH RIGHT NOW. SO STAFF -- AND LOOKING THROUGH THE REVISION, WE LOOKED HEAVILY TO PLANNING COMMISSION WHO HAD A LOT OF FEEDBACK ON THIS. THEIR FEEDBACK WAS PRETTY -- WAS PRETTY -- IT WAS PRETTY AGGRESSIVE, MEANING THAT THE PEDESTRIAN CONFLICTS WERE THEIR BIGGEST CONCERN OF SAFETY. SO THAT WAS THE BASIS OF STAFF'S DENIAL, LOOKING AT THE ORIGINAL SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE, LOOKING AT THE AMOUNT OF EMPHASIS THAT PLANNING COMMISSION PUT UPON PEDESTRIAN SAFETY AT THAT LOCATION. SO THAT IS WHY WHEN THEY CAME IN TO LEAVE THAT CURB CUT OPEN AND THEN NOT TOUCH ANYTHING IN THAT AREA, THAT IS WHY STAFF SAID, THAT'S NOT CONSISTENT WITH THE APPROVED SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE, ORIGINAL PLANNG COMSSNT WH THE MOTI AUT PESTRIA SETY AND TRYING IMPROVET IN THAT AREA. SO I HOPE THROUGH MY LONG WINDED -- I APOLOGIZE THAT. IT WAS IMPORTANT TO TOUCH ON THAT HISTORY. WE LOOKED BACK IN THE RECORDS OF PLANNING COMMISSION TO MAKE OUR RECOMMENDATIONS.
01:32:19.991: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
01:32:22.193: >> Councilmember Grand: I WANT TO THANK PLANNING STAFF, MR. LENART, WHO WALKED ME THROUGH SOME OPTIONS TODAY. I THINK THAT THE QUESTION THAT COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI WHY WOULD ANYONE BE OPPOSED TO THIS. I TALKED TO THE OWNER OF PROPERTY. I LOOKED BACK AT THE HISTORY. WELL, YOU DIDN'T FOLLOW THE RULES A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO AND NOW IT SEEMS TO BE COMING AROUND AND THERE ARE GOOD REASONS FOR PEDESTRIAN SAFETY, AND WHY YOU SHOULD BE DOING THIS. IS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO BALANCE THIS DESIRE FOR BID SAFETY AND BENEFIT, WITH ACCESS FOR A RESIDENT AND I BELIEVE WE ALL RECEIVED AN EMAIL FROM THAT RESIDENT TODAY. SO IN CLOSING THIS CURB CUT IT MEANS THAT THE RESIDENT WILL NOT LONGER HAVE VEHICULAR ACCESS, AT LEAST, TO WHERE SHE LIVES AND WHERE SHE'S LIVED FOR THE PAST TEN YEARS. SO IN TRYING TO BALANCE THAT AND SPEAKING WITH STAFF TODAY, I DID COME UP WITH AN AMENDMENT, YOU KNOW, AGAIN, I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I REALLY PERSONALLY STRUGGLED WITH BACK AND FORTH BECAUSE I THINK THERE ARE PROS AND CONS TO BOTH SIDES, BUT IN SPEAKING WITH STAFF AND, AGAIN, THEY WERE NOT TRYING TO TIP THEIR THUMBS ON THE SCALE ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. IF YOU WERE TO BALANCE THIS OUT, WHAT WOULD IT LOOK LIKE IF YOU HAVE A CURB CUT IS 9 IS THE RECOMMENDATION OF AN AMENDMENT THAT I SENT OUT EARLIER TODAY. AND WHAT IT DOES INSTEAD OF RECOMMENDING THAT THERE ARE RAIN GARDENS THAT IT REQUIRES ALL IMPRECIOUS BETWEEN TAPPAN AND MONROE STREET TO BE REMOVED. SO IT WOULD REMOVE PARKING ON THE TAPPAN STREET SIDE. AS KIND OF A COMPROMISE. SO I'M GOING TO MOVE THAT AMENDMENT.
01:34:24.482: >> Mayor Taylor: CAN YOU READ THAT INTO THE RECORD.
01:34:27.119: >> Councilmember Grand: I THOUGHT I DID, BUT I WILL READ IT AGAIN. SO IT SAYS THAT -- OH, THAT'S THE WRONG AMENDMENT. I APOLOGIZE. I APOLOGIZE, I JUST HAD IT. ALL IMPRECIOUS SURFACE BETWEEN 700 TAPPAN AVENUE AND MONROE MOE STREET SHALL BE REMOVED.
01:34:57.549: >> Mayor Taylor: AND STRIKE ALL THE LANGUAGE WITH RESPECT TO RAIN GARDENS. IS THERE A SECOND?
01:35:04.189: >> Councilmember Grand: AND THAT DOESN'T MEAN WHERE THE BUILDING SITS.
01:35:06.891: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE A SECOND? SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER. IS THAT FRIENDLY TO THE BODY? I WILL ROLL THROUGH THE QUEUE WITH RADINA.
01:35:27.412: >> Councilmember Radina: THANKS. I AM SPEAK ON BOTH OF THESE SINCE THEY ARE RELATED. I'M INCREDIBLY SYMPATHETIC TO THE PROPERTY OWNER AND THE TENANTS WOULD RESIDE THERE AND THE BUSINESS NEXT DOOR. AS COUNCILMEMBER GRAND INDICATED, THERE'S A TENANT WHO HAS LIVED HERE FOR OVER A DECADE AND REALLY DUE TO SOME MEDICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THAT INDIVIDUAL, REMOVING A DRIVEWAY TO HER RESIDENCE WOULD BE PRETTY DETRIMENTAL TO HER. SHE ACTUALLY INDICATED THAT SHE WOULD LIKELY NEED TO RELOCATE. AND SO THAT'S NOT SOMETHING I'M WILLING TO DO HERE. YOU KNOW, I RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S SOME TANGIBLE PEDESTRIAN BENEFIT TO REMOVE THIS CURB CUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THIS AGREEMENT WAS TRIGGERED BY A SITE PLAN THAT ACTUALLY DIDN'T MAKE ANY CHANGES TO THE SITE, BUT RATHER IT WAS MORE OF A REQUIREMENT OF THE NEED TO GET A DISPENSERY PERMIT APPROVED FOR GREEN PLANET AND SO I'M GOING TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF THE OVERALL CHANGE OR OF THE AMENDMENT HERE, BUT I'M ALSO -- TO COUNCILMEMBER GRAND'S AMENDMENT SPECIFICALLY, I'M WILLING TO SUPPORT THIS, I THINK TO MOVE IT ALONG TO SECOND READING AND GET US TO A PUBLIC HEARING WHERE WE CAN HEAR MORE FROM THE PUBLIC AND FROM THE PROPERTY OWNERS AS WELL. THIS ACTUALLY, THE AMENDMENT THAT COUNCILMEMBER GRAND IS PUTTING FORWARD IS REFLECTIVE OF LARGELY THE AGREEMENT THAT GREEN PLANET PROPOSES IN ATTACHED LETTER TO OUR PACKET. SO THE BUSINESS THAT BENEFITS FROM THOSE PARKING SPACES, ACTUALLY SUPPORTS REMOVING THOSE PARKING SPACES. I HAVE SPOKEN TO THE PROPERTY OWNER. I THINK HE HAS A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION THERE AND THAT'S LIKELY SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE WORKED OUT BETWEEN THE LANDLORD AND THE TENANTS BUT IN THIS CASE, I'M WILLING TO MOVE IT FORWARD FOR THE SAKE OF PUBLIC HEARING.
01:37:41.446: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD ON THE AMENDMENT.
01:37:47.518: >> Councilmember Griswold: YESZ. THIS AMENDMENT PRESERVE THE CURB CUT?
01:37:52.056: >> Councilmember Grand: IT WOULD PRESERVE IT. TAKING SOME PARKING OUT TO LEAVE THE CURB CUT IN.
01:38:01.599: >> Councilmember Griswold: OKAY. I WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT, THE CURB CUT WOULD BE LEFT. THANK YOU.
01:38:09.007: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:38:09.874: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. I DON'T SUPPORT THIS, NOT BASED ON THE INFORMATION WE HAVE GOTTEN FROM OUR CITY PLANNER, THE AUSPICES OF THE AGREEMENTS PUT IN PLACE. THIS IS NOT THE ONLY ONE. SOL WE'RE NOT I WOULD BE OKAY WITH IT. -- OBVIOUSLY IT WOULDN'T BE A DISCUSSION OR AN AMENDMENT IF THEY WERE ADDRESSING A DIFFERENT CURB CUT. BUT WE PRIDE OURSELVES ON PEDESTRIAN SAFETY, ESPECIALLY THIS COUNCIL AND VISION ZERO, AND THIS MAIMED  AMENDMENT FLIEO THE FACE WHEN IT COMES TO THE VISION ZERO GOALS AND THERE'S OTHER CURB CULTS THAT CAN BE RE -- CURB CUTS THAT CAN BE REMOVED. I REVVED THAT' MILE JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE. BUT GOVERNMENT MAKES SAUSAGE. IT'S NOT A CLEAN, PRETTY SIGHT AND I DON'T WANT TO BE COLD AND CALLUS TO THE INDIVIDUAL AFFECTED BY THIS, BUT I REALLY HAVE AN ISSUE WITH MAKING EXCEPTIONS ON THE FLY IN CASES LIKE THIS WHERE WE HAVE OVERRIDING GOALS AND PRINCIPLES THAT GUIDE OUR CITY AND OUR STAFF AND THIS IS ONE THAT I DON'T SEE ENOUGH JUSTIFICATION IN ORDER TO MAKE AN EXCEPTION THAT ALLOWS THE CURB CUTS TO CONTINUE TO EXIST IN THE NUMBER THAT THEY DO, WHILE THEY IMPOSE ALL SORTS OF DISRUPTION AND HARDSHIPS ON ALL SORTS OF BUSINESSES AND RESIDENTS THROUGHOUT THE CITY EVERY OTHER WEEK WHEN WE COME TOGETHER. SO I DON'T SEE HOW WE CAN SAVE CREDIBLE AND FACE, AND HAVE THE SUCCESSION. AND THEN WHEN IT COMES TO OTHER FOLKS IN A SUBSEQUENT MEETING OR PRIOR MEETING, WE FOLLOW A VERY STRINGENT LINE. AND SEVEN-DAY FORECAST. SO I'M SORRY. I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF COMPLETING INTERESTS HERE, BUT BASED ON OUR POLICIES AND BASED ON THE EVIDENCE AND THE ARTICULATION OF THE SITUATION, I FIND IT TROUBLING TO BRING THIS AMENDMENT FORWARD.
01:41:03.247: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER DISCH.
01:41:04.449: >> Councilmember Disch: IN MY POSITION ON THE PLANNING COMMISSION, I WILL NOT BE VOTING YES TO THIS AMENDMENT. I UNDERSTAND THE BALANCING AND I THINK IT'S REASONABLE FOR OTHERS TO VOTE ON THIS AMENDMENT. IT'S NOT JUST -- THE ISSUE IS NOT JUST ABOUT THIS CURB CUT AND THE TENANT. THE ISSUE ALSO THAT THIS PROPERTY -- THE PROPERTY WE ARE TALKING ABOUT WAS NOT IN THE SITE PLAN. AT SOME POINT -- WELL, AT SOME POINT, AT WHICH NOBODY IS SURE WHEN IT HAPPENED, DOM DOMINICK'R THE GREEN PLANET PAVED OVER A GRASSY HEAR TO CREATE A PARKING LOT. AND WHEN THEY CAME TO PLAN FOR THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE FOR THE MARIJUANA DISPENSARY, PLANNING SAID, WHAT'S THAT? THAT'S NOT ON YOUR SITE PLAN. WE WANT TO YOU REMOVE THAT. AND SO THEY MADE REMOVAL OF THIS ASPHALTED AREA, WHICH CANNOT SEEM TO BE ON THE ORIGINAL SITE PLAN. THEY MADE THAT IS AS A PLAN FOR THE PUD, AND THE MONROE CURB CULT, AND MR. KOWALSKI CAN VERIFY THAT. AND THEN THE ISSUE IS THAT THEY COME BACK 2020, SAYING WE DON'T REALLY WANT TO REMOVE THE PARKING LOT CAN WE PUT IN A RAIN GARDEN INSTEAD? SO I THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA TO FORCE THEIR HAND ON REMOVING THE PARKING. PLANNING COMMISSION HAS BEEN ASKED TO LOOK AT THIS TWICE AND TWICE IS, NO, WE THINK WE SHOULD ENFORCE THE PUD AND THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE AND IT WAS PARTICULARLY IRRITATING TO PLANNING COMMISSION, I THINK IS UNDERSTANDABLE TO FIND THE PETITIONER, AFTER HAVING BEEN ACCOMMODATED WITH I ASPECIAL EXCEPTION USE TO HAVE THE PETITIONER COME BACK AND NOT HAVING ADDRESSED THE ISSUE OF PARKING THAT THEY INSTALLED WHICH DOESN'T APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN PAR WARRANTED BY ANY PLAN R CODE.
01:43:31.395: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER NELSON?
01:43:35.366: >> Councilmember Nelson: THANK YOU. I SOME CLARIFICATION. I WAS ABLE TO WATCH ONE THE PLANNING COMMISSION'S DISCUSSION ON THIS ISSUE. I WOULD LIKE TO ASK STAFF FOR VERIFICATION. THIS PAVED AREA DIDN'T PREVIOUSLY EXIST OR WE DON'T MOROR LESS, WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHEN IT ORIGINATED. WE CAN LOOK BACK IN OUR PHOTOS, IT'S BEEN THERE FOR A WHILE BUT LOOKING BACK TO THE ORIGINAL SPSITE PLAN, IT WASN'T ON THERE. OUR PHOTOS ONLY GO BACK SO FAR. IT'S BEEN ON THERE FOR AT LEAST 20 YEARS SO.
01:44:15.740: >> Councilmember Nelson:  120  0 YEARS. OKAY. I ALSO SPOKE WITH THIS PROPERTY OWNER AND THE CHALLENGE OF THIS PUD BEING NEGOTIATED WITH EXPANSION IN MIND, AND THE CURB CUT REMOVAL ALSO BEING PART OF WHAT'S WAS EXPANSION ANTICIPATED THAT DIDN'T HAPPENING THAT'S WHAT'S TRAVELING TO ME IN TERMS OF WHAT WE ARE -- TROUBLING TO ME IN TERMS OF WHAT WE ARE CALCULATING BETWEEN VEHICULAR TRAFFIC AND PEDESTRIANS. I WANT TO POINT TO -- OF COURSE WE DO ON PRINCIPLE DISCOURAGE THIS TYPE OF PARKING AREA. I THINK TWO CARS COULD FIT IN IT AND WHEN I VISITED IT, IT WAS NO CAR. IT WAS A DRIVEWAY LEADING TO THIS APARTMENT. I CAN POINT TO WARD 4 AS A REMARKABLE EXAMPLE OF WHERE WE ARE JUST IDENTIFYING A PUBLIC BENEFIT AND THAT'S YORK. THERE'S A LOT OF PARKING IN FRONT OF THERE, RIGHT ON TOP OF THE SIDEWALK AND WE HAVE -- WE LIKE CHARACTER AND SO WE WE LIKE YORK, AND WE WILL ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN. WHILE THIS IS A HIGH PEDESTRIAN AREA? HOW MANY CARS GO DOWN IT AN HOUR? AND HOW MANY CARS ARE LIKELY TO GO DOWN THE DRIVEWAY. I'M GRATEFUL THAT DECISIONS LIKE THIS GET AN EXTRA STOP AT COUNCIL. WHAT I APPRECIATE PLANNING COMMISSION OF IMPOSING THIS IN A STRICKER WAY, IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO STEP BACK AND THINK MORE CAREFULLY ABOUT CAN W WE EXERCISE SOME CON COMMENCE. THEY SAID, FINE, WE DON'T NEED PARKING AND WE WILL PUT PLANTERS UP SO IT'S NOT PARKING ANYMORE. AND I'M CONFLICTED OF THIS AMENDMENT. I DON'T KNOW IF WE ARE GOING TO A GREAT EXPENSE TO RIP THIS UP AND WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THAT? YEAH, THIS TO ME IS NOT -- IT'S NOT HARD TO ALLOW A LITTLE BIT OF FLEXIBILITY.
01:46:41.285: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS AND RADINA AND PERHAPS WE CAN TAKE IT TO A VOTE. COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS.
01:46:47.024: >> Councilmember Briggs: I APPRECIATE COUNCILMEMBER DISCH'S EXPLANATION OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED AT PLANNING COMMISSION. WHILE I APPRECIATE THE SOURCE AND THE DESIRE AROUND BRINGING FORTH THESE AMENDMENTS, I'M NOT SUPPORTIVE OF THEM. I THINK IT'S THESE TYPES OF DISCUSSIONS AND ARE BEST LEFT AT THE PLANNING COMMISSION LEVEL. AND I THINK PARTICULARLY THIS ONE HAPPENED MULTIPLE TIMES AND WE HAVE A RECOMMENDATION COMING IN ORDER TO US BOTH DENIAL FROM STAFF AND DENIAL FROM PLANNING COMMISSION. AND SO FURTHERMORE BEYOND THAT, I DON'T THINK WE CAN MAKE OUR DECISIONS AS MUCH AS WE WANT TO LOOK OUT FOR INDIVIDUALS WITHIN OUR COMMUNITY, THAT'S NOT OUR -- WHEN WE MAKE PLANNING DECISIONS, WE ARE LOOKING HOLISTICALLY HOW DO WE WANT THE COMMUNITY TO LOOK LIKE NOT FOR AN INDIVIDUAL TENANT. AND WHILE I FEEL FOR THIS INDIVIDUAL TENANT, I DON'T THINK THAT THAT IS THE BEST WAY FOR US TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT IS THE BEST DESIGN FOR OUR COMMUNITY.
01:47:55.525: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RADINA.
01:47:56.661: >> Councilmember Radina: I WANT TO CLARIFY A COUPLE OF THINGS, ONE THAT I THINK I HEARD COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI BRING UP ABOUT ADDITIONAL CURB CUTS THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE REMOVED. I'M LOOKING AT THE MAP AND I BELIEVE ALL THE CURB CUTS SERVICE RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES. I WANTED TO ADD THAT IN AS WELL. YES, THERE IS THE POTENTIAL THAT A DIFFERENT CURB CUT COULD BE REMOVED. IT WAS PROBABLY IDENTIFIED BECAUSE THAT'S THE LEAST TENANT THAT WILL BE USING IT. IT'S PROBABLY NOT VERY TRAFFICKED AND MAY NOT ACTUALLY BE PROVIDING THAT MUCH OF A PEDESTRIAN BENEFIT TO REMOVE IT. I APPRECIATE COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS' PERSPECTIVE, WE DON'T WANT TO MAKE DECISIONS FOR INDIVIDUAL RESIDENTS BUT I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO FACTOR IN AND I THINK THIS IS WHY THESE DECISIONS DO COME TO COUNCIL WHERE WE ARE A LITTLE BIT CLOSERS TO THE RESIDENTS AS ELECTED OFFICIALS. THIS IS AN INSTANCE WHERE THE LARGEST IMPACT IS TO A RESIDENT WHO LIVES ON THIS SITE WHO HAS MEDICAL NEEDS REQUIRING HER TO BE ABLE TO DRIVE TO HER DRIVEWAY AND THE REALITY IS THAT DUE TO A SITE PLAN THAT WAS SUBMITTED QUITE SOMETIME AGO, LIKELY BEFORE THEY LIVED THERE, WE WOULD BE REMOVING THAT FROM HER HOME. AND I'M INCREDIBLY SYMPATHETIC TO THAT. I THINK THE COMPROMISE THAT COUNCILMEMBER GRAND IS PUTTING FORWARD. I WILL SUPPORT THIS AND I WILL SUPPORT THE ORIGINAL EITHER WAY. THANKS:
01:49:49.206: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:49:50.174: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. WE DISCUSS GOING MORE TOWARDS TO A COMMUNITY OR A CULTURE THAT'S NOT CAR ORIENTED. AND YET WE ARE MAKING THIS EXCEPTION HERE, BASED ON THE ONE EMAIL THAT WE RECEIVED. AND I DON'T WANT TO COME OFF CRASS AND COLD AND UNSYMPATHETIC, BUT I APPRECIATE COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS' REMINDER THAT WE MAKE DECISIONS BASED ON THE COLLECTIVE WHOLE, THE GREATER GOOD. AND NOT BASED ON INDIVIDUALS. I MEAN, WE CONSTANTLY HAVE ISSUES WHERE WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO PROTEST DECISION THAT WE MAKE THAT GREATLY AFFECT THEM. BUT WE GO FULL STEAM AHEAD. SO TO START MAKING EXCEPTIONS I THINK IS A SLIPPERY SLOPE. APE I DON'T SUPPORT THIS. I SPENT SUPPORT IT TONIGHT. I WON'T SUPPORT THE MAIN MOTION. FURTHER MORE, THIS IS EXTREMELY HEAVY STUDENT PEDESTRIAN AREA. YOU HAVE ROSS, THE BUSINESS SCHOOL, AND ECONOMICS SCHOOL THERE. YOU HAVE QUITE A BIT OF PEOPLE WALKING, THOUSANDS DAILY. UNLIKE PACKARD STREET WHERE YORK IS AT. NOT TO DISCREDIT THE SAFETY CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE THERE, BUT IT'S AN APPLES TO ORANGES COMPARISON WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT MONROE AND TAPPAN AND OVER THERE ON PACKARD. THAT'S CENTRAL CAMPUS WITH THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS ON AN HOURLY BASIS. I WANT SOME CONSISTENCY IN OUR APPLICATIONS OF OUR POLICIES. THAT IS WHAT'S DRIVING MY NO VOTE ON THIS ISSUE.
01:52:08.712: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER.
01:52:09.446: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU.
01:52:18.689: >> Mayor Taylor: DISCUSSION OF THE AMENDMENT. COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
01:52:21.659: >> Councilmember Grand: IT WAS NOT DONE ON THE FLY. IT WAS DONE IN CONSULTATION WITH PLANNING STAFF AND IN THINKING ABOUT A COMPROMISE AND THINKING OF PUBLIC BENEFIT IN TERMS OF THE PUD THAT REMOVING THIS MANY IMPERVIOUS SURFACE WAS A GREATER BENEFIT, POTENTIALLY THAN REMOVING A CURB CUT THAT ONE CAR COMES IN AND OUT OF MAYBE A COUPLE OF TIMES A DAY. I'M HIGHLY, HIGHLY AWARE OF THE PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC THAT GOES THROUGH THIS BUT I DON'T THINK THERE'S A LOT OF CONFLICTS. IT'S SOMETHING IT RUGGED WITH AND WAS TRYING -- I STRUGGLED AND WAS TRYING TO COME ONE A SOLUTION FOR THIS. I WOULD LIKE TO GET RID OF PUDDING ALL TOGETHER. AGAIN, I CAN SEE WHERE REASONABLE PEOPLE WOULD COME DOWN ON EITHER SIDE, BUT IT WASN'T SOMETHING I CAME UP WITH SITTING HERE THIS EVENING. IT WAS DONE IN CONSULTATION AND WITH SOME THOUGHT BEHIND IT.
01:53:48.545: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
01:53:51.614: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I FULLY APPRECIATE THE EFFORT. I THINK IT'S THE RIGHT -- I HAVE A HARD TIME THINKING IT'S NOT THE RIGHT THING TO DO. IT JUST SEEMS FULLY APPROPRIATE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF IMPERVIOUS SURFACE. I WON'T DOWNPLAY THE PROCESS HERE, BUT I WILL SUPPORT THIS AMENDMENT. I THINK IT'S A GESTURE THAT SHOWS, THAT YOU KNOW, CITY HALL ANT ALL ONE WAY. IT'S NOT BLACK AND WHITE AND WE CAN EXIST THAT THERE ARE EXISTING CONDITIONS THAT WE NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO. WE WERE GETTING SOME BENEFITS FROM IT. SO I WILL SUPPORT IT, THANK YOU.

01:55:16.500: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION CARRIES.
01:55:23.807: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN MOTION. BE MINDFUL THIS IS FIRST READING. COUNCILMEMBER DISCH.
01:55:29.346: >> Councilmember Disch: I WANT TO ASSURE ALL OF YOU THAT I -- I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THAT COUNCIL CAN CHANGE THE PUD BY MAKING THE VOTE -- BY VOTING YES ON THIS BUT IT WILL STILL HAVE TO GO BACKO THELANNING COMSSN TO TAL ABOUT THEPECIAL EXEMPTION USEND PLANNING COMMISSION MAY NOT WANT TO APPROVE THAT. I'M TAKING NOTES ON EVERYTHING THAT YOU ARE SAYING AND I WILL CONVEY TO THEM YOUR VIEWS AND WHAT SIGNAL YOU ARE TRYING TO SEND AND I WON'T VOTE YES ON THIS. I JUST WANTED YOU TO KNOW THAT.
01:56:07.083: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
01:56:08.017: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES, I THINK THAT THIS CONVERSATION DEMONSTRATES WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT EARLIER TONIGHT ABOUT CONFLICTING RESOLUTIONS. WE WANT AFFORDABLE HOUSING, THIS ONE UNIT PROVIDES IT. WE WANT INCLUSION IN OUR COMMUNITY. WE HAVE A RESIDENT WHO NEEDS A DRIVEWAY CLOSE TO HER DOOR FOR WELCOME -- MEDICAL REASONS. WE WANT MIXED USE. THIS IS DONE. WE TALK ABOUT PEDESTRIAN SAFETY. I FEEL WE SLAP THAT TERM ON WHENEVER WE WANT IT. WE HAVE A DISPENARRY AT YOST. ONE IS WITHIN 50 FEET AND THE OTHER IS WITHIN 100 FEET. THERE'S MANY DISABLED PEDESTRIANS CROSSING WASHTENAW THERE. ITS EXTREME LeDANGEROUS. IF HE WANT TO TALK ABOUT PEDESTRIAN SAFETY, LET'S TALK ABOUT PEDESTRIAN SAFETY, AND TALK ABOUT SIGHT DISTANCE SO WE CAN SEE AROUND THE CORNERS. LET'S TALK ABOUT STREETLIGHTS ON ALL OF OUR CROSSWALKS SO WE CAN SEE PEDESTRIANS. AND LET'S NOT CHEAPEN THE TERM "PEDESTRIAN SAFETY" BY SLAPPING IT ON WHEN IT REALLY IS NOT THE ISSUE. THANK YOU.
01:57:43.813: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCIL MEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:57:45.048: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: WELL, CURB CULTS INTERSECT PEDESTRIAN SAFETY. IT'S JUST A MATTER OF THE FACT. I HAVE A QUESTION FOR OUR LEGAL DEPARTMENT OR MAYBE OUR PLANNING STAFF. THERE'S THIS ONE RESIDENT WHO HAS RIGG TRIGGERED THIS AMENDMET WHERE THERE WOULD BE AN ADDITIONAL AGREEMENT PLACED ON EVERYTHING THAT'S GONE ON, IT'S GETTING DEEPER AND DEEPER HERE WITH THIS SPECIFIC SITE THAT ONCE THIS RESIDENT WERE TO VIA GATE THAT PROPERTY, THAT WE WOULD -- VACATE THAT PROPERTY THAT WE WOULD ELIMINATE THAT CURB CUT. DOES THAT GET WAY TOO COMPLICATED AND UNENFORCEABLE OR OTHER THINGS THAT NEED TO HAPPEN AFTER THIS VOTE? IS THAT SOMETHING THAT CAN BE INCORPORATED IN THE CONVERSATION AND THE DECISIONS BEING MADE ON WHETHER THERE COULD BE A CONDITIONAL ARR ARRANGEMENT MADE WHEN THAT TENANT MOVES OUT, WITH HE COULD ELIMINATE THE CURB CUT?
01:58:51.181: >> GOOD EVENING, AGAIN, I CAN ANSWER PART OF THAT. OBVIOUSLY, I'M NOT THE LEGAL DEPARTMENT. I CAN SPEAK FROM THE PLANNING AND ZONING POINT OF VIEW, THAT WOULD BE VERY -- ONE, I GUESS I WOULD LET OUR LEGAL DEPARTMENT TO SEE IF IT'S HELD BUT IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE, BECAUSE WE HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING WHEN THAT RESIDENT WOULD MOVE OUT. WOULD SAY I THINK WOULD THAT WOULD BE AN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT THING TO ENFORCE, IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE. AND THEN I WILL LEAVE THE LEGAL ASPECTS TO OUR LO LEGAL TEAM.
01:59:24.214: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, MATT, FOR RESPONDING.
01:59:32.155: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: COULD WE PUT A FIVE-YEAR PROVISION ON THIS, SO THAT THIS COMES BACK TO COUNCIL AT SOME POINT SO THAT THIS ISSUE CAN BE RESOLVED, THE AMENDMENT TO THE SUPPLEMENTAL AGREEMENTS MADE IN 2009. ANYTHING THAT CAN BE DONE TO ADDRESS THAT?
01:59:49.973: >> HE WITH COULDN'T PUT AN EXPIRATION ON THE ZONING, NO, WE COULD NOT DO THAT.
01:59:56.380: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:
02:00:03.587: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL.
02:00:06.056: >> Councilmember Nelson:  THIS IS ON THE MAIN MOTION?
02:00:07.924: >> Mayor Taylor: MY APOLOGIES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THIS IS ON THE MAIN MOTION AS AMENDED, AS I REFLECT.
02:00:14.497: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES.
02:00:21.104: >> Councilmember Disch: NO.
02:00:21.805: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES.
02:00:25.542: >> Councilmember Song: YES.
02:00:26.943: >> Councilmember Grand: YES.
02:00:33.483: >> Councilmember Radina: YES.
02:00:34.551: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
02:00:35.886: >> Councilmember Eyer: YES.
02:00:36.486: >> Councilmember Nelson:  YES.
02:00:40.691: >> Councilmember Briggs: NO.
02:00:41.491: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  NO.
02:00:43.159: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION CARRIES. DB-1, RESOLUTION TO APPROVE GRACE BIBLE CHURCH SITE PLAN, 1300 SOUTH MAPLE ROAD. TAR. MOVED BY DISCH AND SECONDED BY RAMLAWI. DISCUSSION OF DB-1. ALL IN FAVOR? OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. DC-1. RESOLUTION TO CONTINUE ELECTRONIC MEETINGS FOR CERTAIN CITY BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2021. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD. SECONDED BY GRAND. DISCUSSION, PLEASE, OF DC-1. THIS, OF COURSE, COMES TO US FROMMED ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE, IN RESPONSE TO THE OPEN MEETINGS AFFECT THAT WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE IN DECEMBER 31, 2021, WHICH WILL HAVE THE EFFECT OF PROHIBITING CERTAIN MEETINGS PRODUCTLY. AND THOSE ARE LISTED IN THE RESOLUTION. IN MY VIEW, THESE CHANGES TO THE OPEN MEETING ACT WHICH ARE COMING ONLINE IN DECEMBER 31, ARE DEEPLY UNWISE. WE HAVE IT WITHIN OUR POWER TO AFFECT PUBLIC MEETINGS WITH 100% SAFETY, AND WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE ALLOWED TO DO THAT. WE HAVE IT WEAP WITHIN OUR POWEO AFFECT PUBLIC MEETINGS WITH ESSENTIALLY 100% ACCESSIBILITY AND WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE ALLOWED TO DO THAT. WE HAVE IT WITHIN OUR POWER TO AFFECT PUBLIC MEETINGS WITH FUNCTIONALLY 100% TRANSPARENCY AND WE WON'T BE ABLE TO DO THAT BECAUSE THE LEGISLATURE IN ITS WISDOM HAS PUT INTO PLACE MEASURES THAT WILL REQUIRE US TO MEET IN PERSON. IT'S CONTRARY TO THE HEALTH OF MEMBERS OF THE BODY, MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC AND MEMBERS OF STAFF TO OBLIGATE THESE MEETINGS. IT IS CONTRARY TO ACCESS TO MEETINGS. REMOTE MEETINGS, WE WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE REMOTE MEETINGS WHICH WILL HAVE -- WE WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE IN-PERSON MEETINGS. IT WILL HAVE SOME IN-PERSON ACCESS AND SOME REMOTE ACCESS, BUT OTHER BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS WILL NOT. AND THAT IS GOING TO DIMINISH THE ABILITY OF MEMBERS OF PUBLIC TO ACCESS THESE THINGS. REMOTE MEETINGS ARE EFFECTIVE AND ACCESSIBLE AND TRANSPARENT, AND THEY AFFECT PUBLIC BUSINESS IN A WAY THAT IS 100% COVID SAFE. IT'S MY HOPE THAT THE LEGISLATURE WILL OVER TIME HAVE A CHANGE OF HEART AND WILL ALLOW US TO MAKE THIS LOCAL DECISION ON HOW TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS IN A MANNER THAT IS SAFE, EFFECTIVE, OPEN, TRANSPARENT, AND FULLY ACCESSIBLE. COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
02:03:32.295: >> Councilmember Nelson: THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE YOUR REMARKS AND I GUESS I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS, I THINK, FOR STAFF WITH HOW THIS IS MOVING FORWARD. DID I -- I THINK I HEARD YOU SAY, MAYOR TAYLOR THAT SOME OF OUR BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS WOULD HAVE SOME KIND OF HYBRID ACCESS AND SOME WOULD NOT. AND I KNOW THAT THIS HAS BEEN AS TOPIC OF DISCUSSION ABOUT THE COMMISSION OF DISABILITY. SOME OF OUR MEMBERS PREFER BEING IN PERSON, BECAUSE THE VISUAL, WITHOUT -- IT'S JUST HARDER TO NAVIGATE SOME OF THE TECHNOLOGY. ON THE OTHER HAND, IT'S EASIER FOR -- YOU KNOW, THERE ARE TRADEOFFS. WE DID HAVE SOME DISCUSSIONS HERE AND THE DISABILITY COMMISSION, ABOUT PRESERVING PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO ATTEND REMOTELY. HAVE WE FIGURED OUT A WAY TO ESTABLISH AN IN-PERSON MEETING WHERE PEOPLE CAN STILL ACCESS REMOTELY?
02:04:45.034: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. FOURNIER?
02:04:45.735: >> YES, THE TECHNOLOGY SOLUTION THAT WE PUT TOGETHER THIS FOR THAT IS A LITTLE COMPLICATED AND IT CAN ONLY BE PUT INTO EFFECT IN THE CITY COUNCIL CHAMBERS AT THIS MOMENT, AND SO WHAT WE ARE RECOMMENDING IS THAT THE HYBRID MEETINGS ARE ALLOWED FOR THE CITY COUNCIL AND THE PLANNING COMMISSION FOR THE TIME BEING, SO WE CAN TEST THE TECHNOLOGY OUT AND ESSENTIALLY TROUBLE SHOOT WAYS THAT IT CAN BE ROLLED OUT IN A SEAMLESS FASHION TO OTHER BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS.
02:05:23.439: >> Councilmember Nelson:  DID YOU CONSULT WITH ANY OF THE BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS OF CONSULTING WITH BEING VIRTUAL OR IN PERSON?
02:05:31.648: >> WE DID NOT DO A SURVEY, NO. THE HYBRID CAPABILITY WAS DEVELOPED WORKING BETWEEN THE CITY CLERK'S OFFICE, I.T., AND WITH BRETT LENART AND THE PLANNING COMMISSION. AND BETWEEN THOSE INDIVIDUALS THE HYBRID MEETINGS WERE DEVELOPED AND -- BUT VERY NOT DONE A SURVEY OF BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS TO SEE WOULD PREFERS TO MEET IN PERSON OR WOULD WOULD PREFER TO MEET IN A HYBRID FORMAT OR WHO WOULD PREFER TO MEET VIRTUALLY.
02:06:05.882: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I GUESS BECAUSE IT WAS A SPECIFIC TOP ON THE COMMISSION OF DISABILITY, THIS SHOULD VISIT THAT BODY, IF NOT OTHER, BECAUSE WE LITERALLY ARE TALKING ABOUT ACCESSIBILITY ISSUES THERE. AND IT'S PERSON ALLEY RELEVANT FOR ME. SINCE THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE PAN DEM ECK, I FOUND MYSELF IN -- PANDEMIC, I FOUND MYSELF IN QUARANTINE. IS THE HYBRID MODEL, IS TT GOING TO APPLY TO COUNCIL MEETINGS? IS THERE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO PARTICIPATE?
02:06:38.781: >> THE STATE LAW AFTER DECEMBER 31st, WILL NOT ALLOW ELECTED OR APPOINTED MEMBERS TO PARTICIPATE VIRTUALLY. SO IF YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO ATTEND PHYSICALLY, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO ATTEND THE MEETING.
02:06:51.327: >> Councilmember Nelson:  ALL RIGHT, I GUESS I WILL TIGHTEN UP MY MASK THEN. ALL RIGHT, THANKS.
02:06:58.067: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
02:06:59.001: >> Councilmember Hayner:  INK YOU MR. MAYOR AND MAYOR TAYLOR FOR SAYING THAT WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT THAT. I KIND OF HAVE TO AGREE. AS YOU KNOW, I WAS AN EARLY MASK ADVOCATING AND I'M NOT THRILLED BY THIS NOTION THAT WE HAVE TO BE THIS IN PERSON AND WE CAN DO ALL WE CAN FOR OUR OWN HEALTH AND THE COMMUNITY'S HEALTH BUT THEN ANYBODY CAN WALK IN THERE AND IT DOESN'T SEEM OPTIMUM FOR PUBL HEALTH, BUT I ALSO APPRECIATE THAT WE HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THE STATE RULES AND AND THIS THIS IS WHAT WE WILL DO ANDHARE YOU CCERN, HERE AND I WANT TO THANK STAFF AND THE LEGAL TEAM FOR THEIR ANSWER TO THE MANY QUESTIONS. IT'S JUST A CURIOSITY, I THINK, AND YOU KNOW, WE'LL SEE HOW HAD GOES AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN CONTINUE TO ACT IN A WAY THAT PPROTECTS THE HEALTH AND THE SAFETY OF O OURSELVES AND OUR COMMUNITY. I THINK WE ARE DOING A FAIRLY DECENT JOB OF MEETING REMOTELY HERE AND TRYING TO BE OPEN AND STAFF HAS BEEN VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THAT. SO THANK YOU FOR THAT.
02:08:20.449: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RADINA.
02:08:22.085: >> Councilmember Radina: WITHOUT SPENDING TOO MUCH TIME TO REITERATE POINTS. I THINK IT'S INTERESTING THAT WE FIND OURSELVES DISAPPOINTED WITH THE REPUBLICAN LEGISLATURE, THAT IS NOT EX EXTENDING THIS PUBLIC HEALTH MEASURE TO ALLOW US TO CONTINUE TO MEET REMOTELY. I WANT TO USE MY TIME TO ENCOURAGE RESIDENTS TO CONTACT ELECTED OFFICIALS IN LANSING AND TELL THEM TO RECONSIDER. I DON'T HAVE MUCH FAITH IN THAT GIVEN SOME OF THE LEGISLATIVE LEADERSHIP, BUT -- BUT I APPRECIATE ALL THAT WE ARE DOING LOCALLY TO MITIGATE THIS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. THANKS.
02:09:07.496: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
02:09:08.464: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THE CONCERNS AND QUESTIONS AND THOUGHTS AND ISSUES THAT COLLEAGUES HAVE RACERAISED OVER THE MANY MONTHS REGARDING COVID AND MANY MONTHS AND O.M.A. MEETING WITH THE ASSISTANT ADMINISTRATOR AND ORES DURING THE ADMIN MEETING. WE ARE ONE OF ONLY HANDFUL OF ELECTED BODIES THAT STILL MEETS REMOTELY. WE HAVE BEEN AFFORDED THAT OPPORTUNITY AND THAT COMFORT AND HAVE EXERCISED IT TO ITS FULLEST EXTENT. I WOULD JUST SAY FOR THE LAST 19, 20 MONTHS, MY OCCUPATION HAS NOT GIVEN ME THAT COMFORT. I'VE HAD NO SHOW UP AND WORK THROUGH THIS WHOLE THING, EACH AND EVERY DAY. AND NOW IT'S NOT SOMETHING GOING AROUND AND BEATING MY CHEST, LOOK AT ME, I'M SUPERMAN, BUT AT SOME POINT, PEOPLE HAVE TO GET ON WITH GETTING ON. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO MEETING IN PERSON. I THINK PUBLIC AND CITY GOVERNMENT LOSES OUT QUITE A BIT WITH THE ELECTRONIC FORMAT AND I'M ALSO EXCITED ABOUT THE HYBRID VERSION BEING INTRODUCED FOR OUR CITY MEETINGS AND PLANNING COMMISSION MEETINGS TO ALLOW THE PUBLIC TO ENGAGE WITH THEIR GOVERNMENT IN THE COMFORT AND THE SAFETY OF THEIR HOME. I HEN COURAGE MY COLLEAGUES TO GET THE SHOT AND BOOSTERS AND WEAR MASSINGS. BUT AT SOME POINT WE HAVE TO GET ON WITH GETTING ON. I WELCOME THAT DAY. THANK YOU.
02:11:26.402: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER SONG.
02:11:37.279: >> Councilmember Song: COULD STAFF TELL ME IF THE COUNTY AND THE LIBRARY ARE STILL MEETING VIRTUALLY, CORRECT? AND IT'S ONLY THE SCHOOL BOARD THAT'S MEETING IN PERSON CURRENTLY? ARE THERE OTHER MOVEMENTS -- OTHER EFFORTS TO REMAIN VIRTUAL?
02:11:58.634: >> THEY WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO REMAIN VIRTUAL. IT WOULD BE OVERRED BY THE STATE O.M.A., BUT I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH WHAT THOSE ORGANIZATIONS ARE DOING IN THE MEANTIME.
02:12:13.549: >> Councilmember Song: OKAY. GREAT. THANK YOU.
02:12:16.419: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. ALL IN FAVOR? OPPOSES? IT IS APPROVED. DO WE HAVE A CLOSED SESSION TODAY?
02:12:28.598: >> City Atty. Postema: YES, WE DO. I WAS JUST CHECKING THE -- JUST FOR THE RECORD, IT IS A CLOSED SESSION FOR LITIGATION PURPOSES UNDER THE O.M.A.15.268E PENDING LITIGATION. THE TWO CASES ARE YONKER vs. THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR, A WASHTENAW COUNTY CIRCUIT COURT CASE, THAT'S JONKER AND THE SECOND IS DORTCH VERSUS THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR, WASHTENAW COUNTY CIRCUIT COURT AS WELL.
02:13:02.298: >> Mayor Taylor: MAY I HAVE A MOTION TO GO INTO CLOSED SESSION FOR THE FORGOING REASONS? MOVED BY DISCH AND SECONDED BY SONG. ROLL CALL VOTE STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
02:13:14.544: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES.

02:13:42.505: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE ARE IN CLOSED SESSION. SEE YOU ON THE OTHER SIDE. [ CLOSED SESSION ]
02:49:00.853: >> Mayor Taylor: DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? OPPOSED? WE ARE BACK IN OPEN SESSION. WE HAVE BEFORE US THE CLERK'S REPORT OF COMMUNICATIONS, PETITIONS AND REFERRALS. MAY I HAVE A MOTION TO APPROVE THE CLERK'S REPORT. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER DISCH, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER RADINA. DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? OPPOSED? THE CLERK'S REPORT IS APPROVED. WE APPARENTLY HAVE HAD ENOUGH COMMUNICATION FROM THE CITY ATTORNEY. MR. POSTEMA, DO WE HAVE FURTHER COMMUNICATION FROM YOU TODAY? I WILL TAKE THAT AS A NO. WE COME TO PUBLIC COMMENT GENERAL TIME. IT'S TIME FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO SPEAK TO MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL. TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT GENERAL TIME, PLEASE ENTER THE NUMBER ON YOUR SCREEN, 877-853-5247. ONCE YOU ARE CONNECTED, PLEASE ENTER MEETING I.D. 94212732148. 94212732148. ONCE YOU ARE CONNECTED FURTHER, PLEASE ENTER STAR NINE. STAR NINE TO INDICATE THAT YOU WISH TO SPEAK.

WHEN YOUR TIME HAS EXPIRED, PLEASE CONCLUDE YOUR REMARKS AND CEDE THE FLOOR. IS THERE ANYONE WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT?
02:50:51.832: >> Clerk Beaudry: MAYOR, I DON'T SEE ANY CALLERS WITH THEIR HANDS UP.
02:50:55.902: >> Mayor Taylor: SEEING NO ONE, PUBLIC COMMENT IS CLOSED. ARE THERE COMMUNICATIONS FROM COUNCIL? COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS?
02:51:04.511: >> Councilmember Briggs: YES. I WOULD JUST LIKE TO DIRECT COUNCIL'S ATTENTION TO THE RESIGNATION OF BRAD PARSONS ON THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION, WHICH POINTS TO AN OPENING OF THAT COMMISSION. /THERE ARE MEMBERS OF COMMUNITY WHO ARE INTERESTED. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK MR. PARSONS FOR HIS SERVICE ON THE COMMISSION. HE'S BEEN AN INCREDIBLE -- INCREDIBLY KNOWLEDGE AND ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION ADVOCATE AND PROVIDED A LOT OF SERVICE ON THIS COMMISSION. HE DUG INTO THE PACKETS AND WAS THERE WITH DETAILED QUESTIONS, BRINGING THOUGHTFUL IDEAS AND -- TO THE COMMISSION AND CHALLENGING US AS A CITY TO DO MORE. SO I APPRECIATE THAT AND WISH HIM AND HIS FAMILY GOOD LUCK AND NOW IN ALASKA. SO MICHIGAN'S LOSS AND ALASKA'S GAIN.
02:51:55.496: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
02:51:58.165: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  YOU KNOW, I WOULD LOVE TO END THESE MEETINGS ON POSITIVE NOTES, BUT UNFORTUNATELY, MY EXPERIENCE DURING THE COURSE OF THE MEETING LEADS ME TO END THEM SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT. I AM UNDER DISTRESS WHEN WE GO INTO CLOSED SESSION. THE LAST COUPLE CLOSED SESSION MEETINGS THAT WE HAVE GONE INTO, ONE WITH MR. DOHONEY AND THE ONE PRYER TO MR. DOHONEY'S COMING TO ANN ARBOR, I HAVE FELT THERE'S DIFFERENT SETS OF TREATMENT BEING GIVEN TO COUNCILMEMBERS. DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU ARE ON THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM AND HOW CLOSELY YOU ARE ALIGNED TO THE MAYOR. WE ARE NOT TREATED EQUALLY. WE ARE NOT GIVEN EQUAL CONSIDERATION. WE ARE NOT GIVEN EQUAL RESPECT OR TIME. AND I SAY THIS SO THE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDS THE CONDITIONS THAT MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL ENDURE IN CLOSED SESSION. I WILL SAY TODAY'S CLOSED SESSION WAS LIGHTYEARS BETTER THAN OUR LAST ONE. BUT WE HAVE A DOUBLE STANDARD BEING PRACTICED AS TO YOUR POLITICAL AFFILIATION WITH THE MAYOR AND THE KIND OF CONSIDERATION THAT YOU GET WHILE IN CLOSED SESSION. AND THAT THE PUBLIC SHOULD KNOW. I WON'T BE BULLIED OR SILENCED EVEN IN CLOSED SESSION.
02:53:57.284: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
02:53:58.251: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WANT TO THANK STAFF FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO STREETLIGHT OUTAGES. THERE'S STILL OPPORTUNITY FOR IMPROVEMENT, BUT WE ARE MOVING FORWARD. I SAW IT IN THE ADMINISTRATOR'S LETTER TODAY. THAT'S A POSITIVE AND ALSO I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE CONTRIBUTION OF BRADLEY PARSONS WHEN HE SERVED ON THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION. HE WAS VERY ANALYTIC AMAND HE AE ALWAYS GOT TO THE BOTTOM OF THINGS. HE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT PEDESTRIAN CRASHES AND WHAT WAS CAUSING THEM. HE SPENT ONE WEEKEND OF READING ALL THE UD-10 REPORTS AND PROVIDING A REPORT THAT WAS VERY HELPFUL IN MOVING FORWARD. SO GOOD-BYE BRADLEY, AND YOU WILL BE MISSED.
02:54:59.913: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
02:55:00.814: >> Councilmember Hayner:I WILL TRY TO END ON A PLEASANT NOTE. THE'S A LOTF TK ABO GELMANN THE NEW IET PEOE ASKING ME ABOUT IT EVERY TIME SOMETHING HAPPENS ON THAT CASE. I WANTED TO QUICKLY REITERATE MY THANKS TO SCIO FOR DOING SOME WELL TESTING. I THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD THING THAT THEY DID AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THE CITY HAVING OUR OWN SIX WELLS MONITORING AND OPERATING SHORTLY. THE CITY'S WATER SOURCE IS SAFE, AS LONG AS WE CONTINUE TO HOLD THE POLLUTER ACCOUNTABLE AND ACCELERATE THE CLEANUP. THIS IS A LONG-TERM GAME THAT WE ARE PLAYING HERE AND EVERYBODY WHO IS AFFECTED BY IT. WE KNOW SCIO GETS WATER FROM ANN ARBOR. EVERYBODY WHO IS AFFECTED BY IT, CONTINUES TO PLAY THEIR PART AND WE NEED TO DO SO TOO. I WANT TO THANK THE PUBLIC FOR IT NEEMS TO ME, BEING MORE AND MORE AWARE OF THIS CASE, AND VOCAL ABOUT IT. I THINK THAT'S A GOOD THING. WE HAD SOME CALLERS EARLIER WHO SPOKE UP ABOUT PFAS. THEY BROUGHT UP A GOOD POINT THAT WE TALK ABOUT ANCILLARY TO THE GELMAN ISSUE, BECAUSE WE GET WATER DOWNSTREAM FROM VARIOUS POLLUTING INDUSTRIES THAT MAYBE WE DO NEED TO LOOK AT WORKING WITH THE GREATER HURON RIVER WATERSHED PARTERS TO MAKE SURE THESE PLACES ARE SHUT DOWN AND MAYBE DEXTER AND SOME OF THE SMALLER PLACES DON'T HAVE THE LEGAL MITE THAT WILL CRUSH THESE BUSINESSES, OR CHANGING THEIR PLAYS. I APPRECIATE WHEN PEOPLE CALL IN AND EXPRESS THEIR CONCERNS OVER ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES. SO THANK YOU.
02:56:55.762: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER COMMUNICATION FROM COUNCIL? MAY I HAVE A MOTION TO ADJOURN, PLEASE. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER SONG. SECONDED BY GRISWOLD. DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? OPPOSED? WE ARE ADJOURNED.
