00:01:37.523: >> Mayor Taylor: MAY I HAVE A MOTION TO APPROVE THE AGENDA. MOVED AND SECONDED BY RAMLAWI. ALL IN FAVOR. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? THE AGENDA IS PROVED. AND NOW WE COME TO PUBLIC COMMENT GENERAL TIME. ONE NEED NOT HAVE SIGNED UP IN ADVANCE. SPEAKERS HAVE THREE MINUTES IN WHICH TO SPEAK. SO PLEASE PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE TIME CLOCK. AS A MAT OF COURTESY, WE MAY HAVE ONLY ONE PERSON SPEAKING AT A TIME. FINALLY IF YOU REQUIRE ASSISTANCE IN SPEAKING BEFORE COUNCIL, WE WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO PROVIDE IT TO YOU. IS THERE ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT?
00:02:16.862: >> HI, I REQUESTED THE HURON HIGH SCHOOL TURKEY FLOAT POLICY TO BE CHANGED, AND THE CITY COUNCIL -- THE CITY AGREED NOT TO CHANGE. SO I SENT DETAILED REPLY WHAT, YOU KNOW, OUR PUBLIC SECRETARY TOLD HOWARD IS NOT TRUE HOR OR DIFFERENT. SO PLEASE READ THE EMAIL. I HIGHLIGHTED IN RED AND BLACK BOLD FONT. PLEASE, CHANGE THE TRAFFIC FLOW POLICY, BECAUSE BASICALLY, THE NEW -- I MEAN THE OLD TRAFFIC POLICY ROBBED US MONEY, TIME, REALLY. AND YOU DON'T WANT TO CHANGE IT? WHY? I MEAN, THEY SAY THE BUSES ARRIVE AT THE SAME TIME AND STAY THERE. OKAY. GIVE ME THE DATA. THEY DON'T. AND WHEN I COUNT THE BUSES, ONLY EIGHT BUSES WAITING OR UNLOADING. THEY SAID, 16, 17 BUSES NOT LONG ENOUGH USING THE FLOW. SO THEY ROUTE SEVERAL HUNDRED PERSONAL VEHICLES FOR 16 OR 17 BUSES. DOES IT MAKE SENSE TO YOU? ANOTHER THING, WHAT THEY SAY IS THE SAFETY OF OF THE STUDENTS TE PERSONAL AND THE BUSES JOIN THE STUDENTS. THERE'S NO INTERACTION BETWEEN THE STUDENTS AND THE BUSES -- THE VEHICLES. THERE'S NO SAFETY ISSUE. AND ALSO, THE SAME -- THE SAFETY GOAL CAN BE ACHIEVED BY ROUTING BUSES THROUGH THE INTERSECTION, NOT THE HUNDRED VEHICLES. AND THEY SAY BLOCK THE OLD PERSONAL VEHICLES FROM 7 A.M. TO 4 P.M. SCHOOL STARTS AT 7:45 AND ENDS 2:40. DOES IT MAKE SENSE? BLOCK, 7 A.M. TO 4 P.M. AND THEN I ASKED WHY? AND SAY THERE COULD BE SOME BUSES -- SCHOOL BUSES LATER. REALLY? PLEASE CHANGE. DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. LOOK AT THE INTERSECTION. BUSES -- I MEAN, THE VEHICLES WENT THROUGH RED LIGHT, BECAUSE THEY ARE FED UP WAITING FOR, LIKE, MINUTES! TEN MINUTES. PLEASE WATCH THE INTERSECTION AFTER THE SCHOOL STARTS AND WITH THE T SAME TRAFFIC FLOW POLICY.
00:05:18.944: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT?
00:05:24.616: >> IT LOOKS LIKE THE PUBLIC IS MISSING BECAUSE I THINK THESE PEOPLE ARE IN COMMITTEES AND STUFF. THEY ARE NOT REALLY THE PUBLIC. ALL RIGHT. MY NAME IS MOSHGA SAVABIEASFAHANI. I WANT TO ASK THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR TO CLEAN UP THE DIOXANE PLUME THAT GELMAN LEFT FOR US 50 YEARS AGO. I THINK YOU ALL KNOW THE CATASTROPHE THAT HAS UNFOLDED. IT'S 50 YEARS OF POLLUTION GROWING AND 30 YEARS OF CITY OF ANN ARBOR PLAYING FOOTSY WITH GELMAN AND HIS PREDECESSORS. SO WHAT I'M HERE TO SAY IS THIS WE HAVE SEEN -- THE PEOPLE OF ANN ARBOR HAVE SEEN THE RECORD OF OUR OFFICIALS. IT IS A MISERABLE FAILURE WHEN IT COMES TO CLEANING UP OUR ENVIRONMENT. AND DIOXANE IS ONLY ONE EXAMPLE OF IT. FLINT IS ANOTHER CATASTROPHE. AND NOW THE PFAS CONTAMINATION OF OUR WATERS. WHAT WE SEE IS EXTREME LENIENCY TOWARDS THE POLLUTER AND WHAT WE SEE IS CONTINUED POLLUTION OF OUR ENVIRONMENT. IT LEAVES US TO WONDER WHOM ARE YOU SERVING. WHEN UNDER YOUR REIGN, THE POLLUTER ENDS UP WITH THE MONEY IN HIS POCKET FOR DECADES AND WE END UP DRINKING THE DIRTY WATER. WHOM ARE YOU PROTECTING? FROM WHERE I STAND, YOU SEEM TO BE FULLY PROTECTING THE POLLUTER. IN 2005, YOU ALLOWED GELMAN TO GO TO A MORE OR LESS ACCEPTABLE OF CLEANING THE PLUME, AND CONTAINING IT. AT LEAST IT WAS BEING CONTAINED IF IT WASN'T AGGRESSIVELY CLEANED, BUT AT LEAST IT WAS BEING CONTAINED THE PLUME. AYOU ALLOWED THEM TO SAVE MONEY AND PICK A MUCH INFERIOR WAY OF CLEANING UP THE PLUME AND DITCH THE U.V. LIGHT TREATMENT, WHICH IS THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN CLEAN UP DDIOXANE. SO THAT SAVED GELMAN A BUNCH OF MONEY, AND IT ALLOWED OUR ENVIRONMENT TO GET MORE AND MORE AND MORE POLLUTED. YOU ARE DOING THE SAME THING RIGHT NOW WITH PFAS. TRIBAR MANUFACTURING IN WIXOM CONTINUES TO SPEW OUT HIGHLY, HIGHLY, TOXIC PFAS COMPOUNDS AT THOUSANDS OF PARTS PER TRILLION, 28,000 PARTS PER TRILLION. THIS COMPOUND IS MANY, MANY MORE TIMES, HUNDREDS OF MORE TIMES TOXIC THAN DIOXANE AND YOU ARE ALLOWING IT TO HAPPEN. IT'S FUNCTIONING. YOU HAVEN'T CRIMINALLY CHARGED THEM. YOU HAVEN'T GONE IN THERE AND CLEANED IT UP. YOU CAN DO ALL OF THAT, BUT HAVE YOU NOT DONE IT. CLEAN UP THE DIOXANE PLUME NOW.
00:08:30.669: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. IS THERE INN IN  ANYONE ELSE WHD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT. SEEING NO ONE, PUBLIC COMMENT IS CLOSED. DO WE HAVE A CLOSED INTERROGATION, MR. POSTEMA.
00:08:41.747: >> City Atty. Postema: WE DO. IT'S UNDER THE OPEN MEETINGS ACT FOR A PENDING LITIGATION PROVISION IN THE CASE OF ATTORNEY GENERAL vs. GELMAN SCIENCES. IT'S A WASHTENAW COUNTY LAWSUIT.
00:08:52.290: >> Mayor Taylor: MAY I HAVE A MOTION TO GO INTO CLOSE SESSION? MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER SMITH, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER EATON. DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
