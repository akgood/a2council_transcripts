00:00:14.557: >> Mayor Taylor: GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE, AND WELCOME TO THE SEPTEMBER 23rd WORK SESSION OF THE ANN ARBOR CITY COUNCIL, A SPECIAL WORK SESSION WITH RESPECT TO MARIJUANA REGULATION. WE HAVE BEFORE US A DISCUSSION OF THE PROPOSED ORDINANCES FOR THE ZONING AND THE PERMITTING OF ADULT USE RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA ESTABLISHMENTS AS ALLOWED BY THE MARIJUANA REGULATION AND TAXATION OF MARIJUANA ACT. MR. LAZARUS?
00:00:38.182: >> City Admin. Lazarus: THANK YOU, MAYOR. WELCOME COUNCILMEMBERS. WE ARE GOING TO START THIS EVENING WITH A SHORT PRESENTATION TO KIND OF BRING EVERYBODY TO A SIMILAR LEVEL OF UNDERSTANDING WHERE WE ARE, TO KIND OF DEFINE SOME TERMS AND SET THE STAGE AND THEN WITH THIS SPECIAL CALL WORK SESSION, OUR HOPE IS TO ALLOW AS MUCH TIME FOR QUESTIONS AND DISCUSSION AS WE CAN AND AS THE COUNCIL CAN TOLERATE. SO I WILL TURN IT OVER TO MR. LENART. WHILE HE'S DOING IT. I WANT TO EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION TO BRAD AND MR. McDONALD AND MS. LARKEN OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS AND LAST WEEK.
00:01:18.355: >> GOOD EVENING, I'M BRENT LENART, THE PLANNING MANAGER. JOININGME WILL BE CHRISTEN LARKAM AND THE ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. I WANT TO START VERY BROADLY. THE CITY OBVIOUSLY HAS A UNIQUE HISTORY WITH MARIJUANA THAN A LOT OF OTHER COMMUNITIES BOTH IN THE STATE OF MICHIGAN AND THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. A HISTORY OF INVOLVEMENT, WHETHER IT BE THE HASH BASH OR THE ACTIVIST GROUPS OR PRETTY PROGRESSIVE, IN SOME EYES AT THE TIME, MUNICIPAL REGULATIONS GOVERNING MARIJUANA IN THE COMMUNITY. AND MORE RECENTLY, THAT'S BEEN ENHANCED THROUGH LEGAL STATUTES AND ACT. THE FIRST 2008, WAS THE MICHIGAN MEDICAL MARIJUANA ACT. THIS WAS OPENING THE STRUCTOR FOR C CAREGIVERS TO USE MARIJUAA MENISCALLY. AND THEN THERE WAS CREATING BUSINESSES AROUND THAT INDUSTRY, THROUGH THE MEDICAL MARIJUANA FACILITIES LICENSING ACT AND THEN IN 2018, VOTER INITIATED REFERENDUM WAS ADOPTED, THE MICHIGAN REGULATION AND TAXATION OF MARIJUANA ACT OR IN SORT OF COMMON REFERENCE FOR TONIGHT, THE RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA ACT. THIS EVOLUTION IS COMPLEX IN THAT WHILE IT SEEMS VERY LOGICAL IN THE STEPS WE COVERED FROM 2008 TO 2018, THERE THINGS THAT ARE COMPLEX, REFERENCE TO THE ACT IS DISTINCT AND THE TYPES OF FACILITIES THAT ARE DISTINCT ARE SOMETIMES SHARED TERMS AND SOMETIMES DISTINCT TERMS AND YOU WILL NOTICE IN THAT SLIDE, PARTICULARLY IN THAT LAST PARAGRAPH, THE UNDERLINED TERMS ARE THOSE NEW FACILITIES THAT ARE ESTABLISHED FOR FIRST TIME UNDER THE MICHIGAN RECREATIONAL AND TAXATION OF MARIJUANA ACT. SO I'M GOING TO COVER ON SURPRISINGLY, HOW WE APPROACH THIS FROM A LAND USE PERSPECTIVE AND RECOMMEND UNITED FROM THE UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE AND I WOULD SAY THAT YOU SHOULD ALL BE CONGRATULATED THAT THE MEDICAL MARIJUANA CHANGES TO THE U.D.C. SET A GREAT STAGE TO CONSIDER THE IMPLEMENTATION OF RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA INTO OUR ORDINANCE AND WE FOLLOWED THAT LEAD IN TRYING TO BUILD ON THE LANGUAGE THAT ALREADY EXISTED. ALL IS NOT OVERLY COMPLEX. THERE ARE A LOT OF SHARED TERMS THAT WERE CREATED AND ESTABLISHED IN OUR U.D.C. THROUGH THE MEDICAL FACILITIES ACT THAT WE HAVE SIMPLY -- ARE SIMPLY RECOMMENDING STRIKING THE TERM MEDICAL FROM. FACILITIES IS A GENERAL TERM AND THEN SAFETY COMPLIANCE BEING SECTOR, TRANSPORTER, GROWER AND PROCESSOR, THEY WILL BE FACILITIES, WHETHER FOR MEDICAL OR RECREATIONAL USE. THE RECREATIONAL ACT DOES CREATE SOME NEW TERMS AND NEW USES. YOU HAVE OBVIOUSLY SEEN THOSE AT FIRST READING PREVIOUSLY BUT WE WANTED TO SPEND A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME ABOUT EXPLAINING THOSE TONIGHT. THE FIRST IS DESIGNATED MARIJUANA CONSUMPTION FACILITY AND UNSURPRISINGLY, THIS IS A BUSINESS FACILITY ESTABLISHED WHERE ADULTS 21 YO 21 YEARS OF R OLDER CAN GO TO SMOKE OR INGEST IN OTHER METHODS. WE ARE CARRYING FORWARD THE REQUIREMENT THAT IT BE 1,000 FEET FROM THE SCHOOL AND WE ARE RECOMMENDING IT BE ALLOWED IN COMMERCIAL DISTRICTS BECAUSE IT -- BY ITS NATURE, IT'S A RETAIL SERVICE USE. IT IS CUSTOMERS GOING TO ACCESS A SERVICE, AND SO THEREFORE, WE THOUGHT IT WAS VERY APPROPRIATE WITH OTHER BUSINESS AND COMMERCIAL USES. YOU WILL RECALL FROM YOUR FIRST READING OF THIS, THIS IS NOW VIA AMENDMENTS AT THE -- OF THIS BOARD. IT CAN BE COLLOCATED WITH A PROVISIONING CENTER OR RETAILER AND, AGAIN, THIS IS A PLACE WHERE YOU CAN CONSUME, BUT THERE ARE RESTRICTIONS THAT YOU CANNOT SELL PRODUCT AT THIS LOCATION. A NEW TERM IS A MARIJUANA RETAILER. WHILE THIS IS A NEW TERM, IT'S VERY P PROXIMATE TO A MARIJUANA THAT SILLITY. THIS IS ESSENTIALLY A STORE WHERE AN ADULT CAN GO AND BUY RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA. OUR PROPOSAL IS TO -- AS REFLECTED IN THE PROPOSED U.D.C. CHACHANCHANGES IS TO TREAT IT SM TO PROVISIONING CENTERS. AGAIN, IT'S A RETAIL FUNCTION. IT IS A COMMERCE-TYPE USE. SO WE ARE RECOMMENDING THAT WE MAINTAIN IT AS RETAIL, AND ACCESSORY USE, WHEN IT'S A LARGER FACILITY IN THE MANUFACTURING DECEMBER STRICTS. WE ARE RECOMMENDING THAT THE PROVISIONING CENTERS ARE AUTOMATICALLY APPROVED NOW UNDER THEIR EXISTING SPECIAL EXCEPTION USES TO BE RETAIL CENTERS AS WELL. IN IS BUILDING ON LANGUAGE, ACTUALLY, OF THE STATE OF THE APPROVED ACT THAT ACTUALLY LIMITS NEW APPLICATIONS FOR A TIME PERIOD ONLY TO EXISTING PROVISIONING CENTERS THAT HAVE BEEN LICENSED UNDER THE MEDICAL ACT AS OPPOSED TO OPENING IT TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC. SAME STANDARDS APPLY. 1,000 FEET FROM SCHOOLS AND THE INTENTION IS THAT THE CAP, WHICH WE'LL GET TO IN THE ATTORNEY'S PORTION OF THE PRESENTATION, IS THAT 28 PERMIT CAP, THOSE 28 PROVISIONING CENTER CAPS BECOME SHARED PROVISIONING CENTER AND/OR RETAILER PERMITS. SO THAT IT WOULD HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO BE A SHARED FACILITY OR IT COULD BE ONE OR THE OTHER ALL CAPPED AT THE PROPOSED 28 PERMITS. MARIJUANA MICRO BUSINESS IS A NEW FACILITY ESTABLISHED UNDER THE RECREATIONAL ACT. THIS IS A FACILITY THAT ALLOWS HAD THE GROWING, PROCESSING AND SALE OF PRODUCT DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS. IT DOESN'T ALLOW TRANSFER TO OTHER PROCESSING CENTERS OR TO PROVISIONING CENTERS, NOR DOES IT ALLOW CONSUMPTION. SO IT'S SORT OF THE EQUIVALENT OF A MICROBREWERY, WHERE YOU WOULD HAVE TO TAKE EVERYTHING OUT IN A GROWLER AS OPPOSED TO DRINKING IT ON RECOMMEND SIS. -- PREMISES. WE ARE PROPOSING THIS AS A SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE IN THE C3 DISTRICT AND THE MANUFACTURING DISTRICTS. THE NATURE OF THAT IS THE PRIMARY PORTIONS OF THIS USE, THERE'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE MORE OF THE FLOOR AREA DEDICATED TO THE GROWING AND PROCESSING THAN THE RETAIL OPERATIONS. SO THAT'S WHY THE RECOMMENDATION IS FOR THOSE ZONING DISTRICTS AND CORRESPONDINGLY HOPEFULLY THERE'S MORE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE SIZE OF FLOOR PLAN THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED FOR THOSE USES THERE. THEY WOULD ALSO HAVE TO BE 1,00S PART OF THESE AMENDMENTS WE ARE ADDING A REQUIREMENT THAT 10% OF THE ENERGY MUST COME FROM RENEWABLE ENERGY OR SOLAR PANELS INSTALLED ON THE SITE OF THE MICROBUSINESS. WE ARE ALSO PROPOSING THAT CHANGE TO NEW GROW FACILITIES. A LOT OF COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE SORT OF ARE FURTHER AHEAD OF THE EVOLUTION OF MARIJUANA LAW AND BUSINESS FACILITIES HAD A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES WITH ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND DEMAND ON THOSE AND WE BEL THIS IS A REASONABLE STEP TOWARDS TRYING TO MITIGATE SOME OF THOSE FACTORS. FINALLY, WE HAVE MADE CHANGES TO THE PERMITTED USE TABLE, IDENTIFYING WHICH OF THOSE USES ARE GOING TO BE PERMITTED AND WHICH DISTRICTS AND SPECIAL EXCEPTION USES. WE ADDED THE SPECIFIC STANDARDS OR PROVISIONS. THIS IS WHERE WE HAVE NOW ADDED THE REFERENCES TO THE RECREATIONAL STATUTE. WE HAVE ADDED THE NEW USES INTO THE REQUIREMENTS. WE HAVE CLARIFIED THAT BOTH MICROBUSINESS AND RETAILERS ARE NOW SUBJECT TO THAT 600-FOOT SEPARATION AGREEMENT WHERE PREVIOUSLY ONLY PROVISIONING CENTERS WERE AND WE SPECIFICALLY HAVE EXEMPTED THE CONSUMPTION FACILITY. PREVIOUSLY THERE WAS A BLANKET PROHIBITION THAT NO CONSUMPTION COULD OCCUR AT ANY MARIJUANA FACILITY. NOW WITH THE INTENTION OF DESIGNATED CONSUMPTION  FACILITY TO BE OPPOSITE OF THAT, WE WANT TO CLEAR PROVISION TO ALLOW FOR THAT AND AS I REFERENCED PREVIOUSLY, IT'S A 10% ANNUAL ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SEEKING TO GET A RELIEF FROM THE NEW ENERGY DEMAND. AND THE THIRD ACT WHICH IS BEING PROPOSED INTO THE UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE. GENERALIZING SOME OF THE CODES THAT ARE SAFETY COMPLIANCE FACILITY, SECURED TRANSPORTER AND THE LIKE AND THE NEW USES AND FACILITATIVES THAT ARE BEING ESTABLISHED. SO NEXT UM, I WILL TURN IT OVER TO KRISTA LARKUM WHO WILL GO OVER THE MORE GENERALIZED PERMITTING ORDINANCE.
00:10:34.878: >> I HAD, MAYOR AND COUNCIL. KRISTEN LARKUM ASSISTANT CITY ATTORNEY. SO I AM GOING TO TALK AND IT WILL BE VERY SHORT ABOUT THE PERMITTING ORDINANCE. WHAT WE HAVE TRIED TO DO MAKE AS FEW CHANGES AS WE NEED TO AND JUST INCORPORATE ADULT USE MARIJUANA INTO WHAT -- INTO THE FRAMEWORK WE ALREADY HAVE FOR MEDICAL MARIJUANA. AND AS BRETT HAS ALREADY GONE OVER, AS YOU CAN SEE, THE -- THERE ARE FOUR OF THE DIFFERENT TYPES IN THE MMFLA AND THE RMTLA THAT HAVE THE SAME NAME. THEY ARE ESSENTIALLY HAVE THE EQUIVALENT FUNCTION. AND SO WE DON'T REALLY DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THEM FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE PERMITS, THE CITY PERMITS. THERE IS ONE THAT IS DIFFERENT, BUT ALSO HAS THE EQUIVALENT FUNCTION AND I THINK BRETT COVERED THAT TOO, PROVISIONING CENTER. THEY GAVE THEM TWO DIFFERENT NAMES, BUT FUNCTIONALLY, THEY ARE EQUIVALENT. SO FOR PURPOSES OF THE PERMIT, WE HAVE JUST CALLED IT A PROVISIONING CENTER/RETAILER. AND THERE ARE THESE TWO NEW TYPES OF FACILITIES, THE DESIGNATED CONSUMPTION FACILITY AND THE MICROBUSINESS WILL BE REQUIRING THE ORDINANCE REQUIRES PERMITS FOR BOTH OF THOSE ALSO. THE CURRENT ORDINANCE, IT HAS A 28 PROVISIONING CENTER CAP. WE ARE JUST CARRYING THAT OVER, EXCEPT CHANGING THE NAME TO PROVING CENTER RETAILER, CAP OF 28, AND AT FIRST READING, COUNCIL AMENDED THE ORDINANCE AMENDMENT, TO PUT A CAP ON DESIGNATED CONSUMPTION FACILITIES AND MARIJUANA MICROBUSINESSES, SIMILARLY 28. SO WHAT WE HAVE DONE AND I THINK BRETT COVERED MOST OF THIS ALREADY. WE DETERMINED -- OR THE ORDINANCE DEEMS THOSE WHO HAVE PROVISIONING CENTERING TO BEIONS AND SO THOSE WHO HAVE PERMITS AS PROVISIONING CENTERS UNDER THE ORDINANCE AMENDMENT WOULD BE COUNTED IN THAT 28 CAP. SO I DON'T -- I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING LIKE 15 PERMITS NOW AND SO THOSE 15 WOULD COUNT TOWARDS THE 28 CAP. I THINK THAT PRETTY MUCH COVERS IT. LIKE I SAID, IT WOULD BE SHORT.
00:13:42.666: >> I WOULD LIKE TO COVER VERY BRIEFLY THE PERMIT APPLICATION, WHICH WE HAVE SPOKEN OF. THE CURRENT STATE LAW THAT ALLOWS THESE RECREATIONAL FACILITIES REQUIRES THAT A CITY TO HAVE A COMPETITIVE PROCESS AS IS DESCRIBED WHEN THE CITY PUTS A NUMERICAL LIMIT ON THE NUMBER OF PERMITS THAT ARE AVAILABLE. AS PROPOSED RIGHT NOW, AS KRISTEN LARKUM JUST SHOWED YOU, AS AMENDED BY THE COUNCIL, WE HAVE PERMIT LIMITS ON THREE DIFFERENT AREAS. THE PROVISIONING CENTER RETAILER, THE MICRO BUSINESS AND THE DESIGNATED CONSUMPTION FACILITY. AND THOSE THREE PARTICULAR USES WOULD REQUIRE THIS COMPETITIVE PROCESS. AND ESSENTIALLY THIS IS SUCH THAT -- AND THIS IS JUST IN THE STATE LAW THAT IF THE STATE RECEIVES MORE APPLICATIONS THAN THE CITY IS ALLOWING, IT REALLY TURNS TO THE CITY TO MAKE THE DECISION AS TO WHICH APPLICATIONS IT'S SUPPOSED TO ACTUALLY ISSUE. AND SO THE -- EXCUSE ME, THE LANGUAGE THAT'S IN THAT STATE LAW REGARDING THAT SAYS IT'S REALLY THE MUNICIPALITY'S DUTY TO CHOOSE THE APPLICATIONS WHICH ARE BEST SUITED TO OPERATE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE STATE LAW. WE WILL BE RECOMMENDING TO YOU ALONG WITH THE ADMINISTRATOR AN ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS THAT WILL BE ESTABLISHED BY RESOLUTION. THE WAY THAT THAT WILL WORK IS THE CITY WILL PROBABLY ON A QUARTERLY BASIS OPEN UP AN ACCEPTANCE PERIOD FOR A SET DURATION. WE HAVEN'T DECIDED ON WHAT DURATION WILL BE EACH QUARTER AND THEN ALL APPLICATIONS WILL BE SCORED AGAINST THE OTHER APPLICATIONS FOR THAT QUARTER, AND THE CITY WILL -- AND THE CITY WILL THEN ISSUE APPLICATIONS BASED ON THOSE THAT SCORE HIGHEST. AND WE ARE REALLY DOING THIS AND IT'S REALLY TO KIND OF TRACK AND SIMILAR TO THE WAY THAT WE REALLY PROCESS OUR REPORT FOR PROPOSALS AND OR APPLICATIONS. IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE AN OBJECTIVE PROCEDURE SO WE CAN COME UP WITH THE APPLICATIONS THAT SHOULD RISE TO THE TOP OF THE PACK AND SHOULD BE SCORED AND THEN THOSE FOLKS WHEN THEIR LICENSE IS AVAILABLE, WILL BE GIVEN THE ABILITY TO MOVE FORWARD IN THE PROCESS. AND SO JUST AN OUTLINE OF THE PROPOSED PROCESS AND I'M GOING TO BE VERY CLEAR THAT WE HAVE NOT WORKED OUT ALL OF THE DETAILS AND WE'RE SEEING -- AND I WILL NOTE THAT WE ARE SEEING SIMILAR PROCESSES BEING BROUGHT FORWARD EVEN AS WE SPEAK IN OTHER COMMUNITIES AROUND MICHIGAN, BUT ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT IS A POINTS PROCESS, WHERE THE APPLICATION WILL BE GRADED AGAINST VERY SPECIFIC CRITERIA. IN HERE IS AT LEAST AN INITIAL PROPOSAL WHERE THERE WILL BE SOME POINTS MAYBE 25 GRANTED FOR PAST PERFORMANCE EXPERIENCE WITE COMMUNITY. THAT WOULD BE LIKE THE APPLICANT HISTORY OPERATING THE SAME TYPE OR SIMILAR TYPE LICENSED FACILITY IN ANY COMMUNITY IN MICHIGAN. THE APPLICANT HISTORY OPERATING A LICENSE OF MARIJUANA BUSINESS IN ANY COMMUNITY IN MICHIGAN AND THEN SPECIFICALLY THE HISTORY OF THOSE APPLICANTS OPERATING THOSE SAME TYPES OF -- OR EQUIVALENT TYPES OF FACILITIES IN THE CITY OF NASH AND THE LENGTH OF TIME OPERATING THE LICENSED MARIJUANA BUSINESSES, AS WELL AS OTHER GENERAL RELEVANT MANAGEMENT AND BUSINESS EXPERIENCE. UNDER BUSINESS PLANS STATE COMPLIANCE, WE WOULD BE LOOKING AT THINGS LIKE THE OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE, THE CHART, THE FINANCIAL STRUCTURE AND THE FINANCING, PROOF OF PREQUALIFICATION AND PLAN TO MINIMIZE THE EXPOSURE TO MINORS OF THE MAR MARKETING FACILITIESD THE FACILITY ITSELF. UNDER LOCATION, WE WOULD, OF COURSE, LOOK AT REALLY PRIMARILY WHETHER THE PROPOSED LOCATION IS CONSISTENT WITH THE CITY'S ZONING ORDINANCES BUT WE WOULD ALSO WANT TO LOOK AT THINGS LIKE GEOGRAPHIC EQUITY, MAKING SURE THAT THE GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION OF THE APPLICANT'S PROPOSED FACILITY TO OTHER SIMILAR PROPOSED FACILITIES IN THE CITY, ACCESSIBILITY OF THE FACILITY TO TRAFFIC, AND OTHER ITEMS. UNDER COMMUNITY INTEREST, THAT WILL INCLUDE POINTS FOR THINGS LIKE THE PLAN AND STRATEGIES FOR COMMUNITY OUTREACH, AND EDUCATION, JOB CREATION, USE OF RENEWABLE ENERGY, AS WELL AS HOW THE FACILITY MAY RESPOND TO SPECIFIC COMMUNITY NEEDS. BUT THE IDEA HERE IS THAT THIS WILL BE A VERY SPECIFIC POINT SYSTEM. THERE WILL BE POINTED GRANTED FOR THING BEING ACHIEVED AND THEREFORE IT WILL BECOME AN OBJECTIVE SYSTEM AND WILL ALLOW US TO MEET THE STATE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PERMIT APPLICATION PROCESS. AND SO REALLY, THAT IS THE VERY QUICK INTRODUCTION WE WANTED TO GIVE YOU ON THE U.D.C., AS WELL AS THE CHANGES TO THE -- TO THE CITY'S PERMIT ORDINANCE AND SO WE WILL LEETCH LEAVE IT NOW TO COUNCIL'S DISCUSSION AND WE ARE LAPPIE TO ANSWER ANY -- HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE.
00:18:58.314: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
00:18:59.148: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU, MAYOR. THANK YOU TO STAFF FOR CONDUCTING THIS WORK SESSION TONIGHT AND FOR RESPONDING TO MY MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS. AS YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T VOTE FOR THE TWO ORDINANCES AT FIRST READING, LAST MEETING BECAUSE I DID NOT THINK THAT THEY WERE READY OR THAT THE STAFF THE CITY -- THE STAFF AND THE CITY COUNCIL WERE TAKING THE TIME NECESSARY TO GET THIS RIGHT. AND I THINK IF ANYONE READS THE RESPONSES TO THE QUESTIONS THAT WE RECEIVED, YOU -- I THINK YOU MIGHT NOW SHARE THIS CONCERN THAT WE ARE RUSHING THIS JUST SO WE CAN BE OPEN FOR BUSINESS WHEN THE STATE BEGINS TAKING APPLICATIONS ON NOVEMBER 1st. THIS IS A REALLY BIG DEAL. RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA IS OBVIOUSLY COMING AND WE ARE SETTING THE REGULATIONS OF HOW MANY FACILITIES THERE CAN BE AND HOW THEY CAN OPERATE. SO IT'S A BIG DEAL AND FROM THE RESPRESPONSES WE NOW. WE HAVE DONE ZERO BENCHMARKING. WHETHER IT'S WHAT CITIES OF MICHIGAN HAVE DONE OR THE CITY LIKE BOULDER WHICH WE CLEARLY RESPECT AND LIVED THIS REALTIME FOR FIVE YEARS NOW. TWO, WE KNOW WE NEED A COMPETITIVE PROCESS WHICH WE JUST NOTED FOR ALLOCATING PERMITS. WE DON'T HAVE ONE. I SUBMITTED QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS. WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE DRAFT THAT STAFF IS WORKING ON, WHICH OBVIOUSLY IT'S NOT IN A FINAL FORM. WE HAVE RECEIVED NO SPECIFICITY OF IT AND IT'S FIRST WE HAVE SEEN IN TERMS OF ANY KIND OF ROLLOUT OF A COMPETITIVE PLAN. WE KNEW THAT THE STATE REQUIRES THIS. AND I THINK WE NEED TO APPROVE SOMETHING IN TERMS OF THIS COMPETITIVE PLAN, CORRECT ME IF I'M RIGHT OR WRONG, MR. McDONALD. BEFORE NOVEMBER 1st, THE PLAN NEEDS TO BE IN PLACE.
00:21:08.678: >> ARE YOU ASKING ME IF IT LEGALLY NEEDS TO BE PLACED?
00:21:11.981: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES, I AM.
00:21:12.782: >> I WOULD SUGGEST THAT COUNCIL PUTS IT IN PLACE BY THEN. IT'S UNCLEAR.
00:21:17.220: >> Councilmember Lumm: WHENEVER YOU CAN GET THAT TO US. IT WOULD BE HELPFUL. THREE, WE KNOW WE DON'T HAVE A PROCESS TO ALLOCATE PERMITS. WE DON'T KNOW WHO WILL DECIDE AND WHETHER WE NEED AN ADVISORY BOARD. WE KNOW WE ARE TRIPLING THE NUMBER OF FACILITIES. RETAIL TYPE FACILITY, SALE OR CONSUMPTION CAN OCCUR. WE DON'T HAVE ANY SENSE OF HOW MANY FACILITIES PER CAPITA ARE REASONABLE OR APPROPRIATE. I ASKED ABOUT THAT. NO BENCHMARKING HAS BEEN DONE. WE KNOW THAT ADDITIONAL NOW, WE KNOW THAT ADDITIONAL POLICING RESOURCES WILL BE REQUIRED AND THAT BUDGET AMENDMENTS FOR MORE RESOURCES ARE LIKELY YET THIS FISCAL YEAR. BUT WE DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH. FOR WHAT RELATION IS BETWEEN THE NUMBER OF FACILITIES AND THE INCREMENTAL RESOURCES REQUIRED AND WE NOW KNOW OUR POLICE AND FIRE DEPARTMENTS HAVE NOT BEEN ENGAGED AT ALL. THEY HAVE NOT BEEN CONSULTED IN DEVELOPING THE REGULATIONS WE ALREADY VOTED ON ONCE. WHICH I GOT TO TELL YOU, THAT WAS SHOCKING. SO THESE ARE JUST A FEW EXAMPLES OF WHY THIS ISN'T READY FOR PRIME TIME AND IT'S AMAZING TO ME THAT WE HAVE NOT TAKEN THE TIME TO STUDY THIS IN IN-DEPTH, TO STUDY WHAT BOULDER HAS DONE, AND THEY HAVE LIVED THIS. SO, AGAIN, IF YOU LOOK AT BOULDER'S ORDINANCES, AS I HAVE DONE, YOU SEE A MUCH MORE DETAILED AND VERY SPECIFIC SET OF REQUIREMENTS AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING OPERATIONS, AND YOU SEE A GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE IN PLACE TO MONITOR AND ENSURE GUIDANCE. WE THOUGHT WE SHOULD ADOPT A TEMPORARY -- TEMPORARY OPT OUT. EMPHASIS ON TEMPORARY. THAT FAILED WITH SEVERAL OF MY COLLEAGUES SAYING THEY COULDN'T OPERATE A TEMPORARY OM OPT OUT F 30 DAYS OR SO, BECAUSE OF THE MESSAGE IT WOULD SEND. WHAT TERRIBLE MES MESSAGE ARE WE SAYING THAT WE WILL TAKE 30 DAYS TO STUDY WHAT BOULDER AND OTHERS HAVE DONE TO ENGAGE POLICE AND FIRE IN THE PROCESS WHO HAVE BEEN OUTSIDE OF THIS PROCESS AND TO THINK THROUGH THE DETAILS OF THE -- INCLUDING THE PROCESS WE USED TO ALLOCATE THE AVAILABLE PERMITS? ALL WE ARE SAYING IS THAT FOR THE SAKE OF OUR RESIDENTS WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO GET THIS RIGHT AND WE ARE TAKING ANOTHER MONTH OR SO. WE WORK FOR THE RESIDENTS I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE REAL IMPACTS ON THEM AND OUR COMMUNITY. I'M MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT THAN PERCEIVED MESSAGES. FOR THOSE WHO SAY AND I'M ALMOST DONE. NO BIG DEAL, IF THERE'S PROBLEMS WE WILL MAKE CHANGES LATER. YOU KNOW, AS I DO THAT ONCE PERMITS ARE GRANTED UNDER A SET OF REGS, THEY CANNOT BE REVOKED BECAUSE WE DECIDE TO CHANGE THE RULES. WE LIVE WITH THE SET OF CONSEQUENCES THAT COME BACK FOR THAT. SO I WILL BE MOVING TO A TEMPORARY -- TEMPORARY OPT OUT TO GET THIS RIGHT AND HOPEFULLY YOU CONCLUDE AGAIN -- I INVITE ANYBODY TO LOOK AT THE RESPONSES TO THE QUESTIONS I COMMITTED. IT SHOWS YOU WHAT WE HAVEN'T DONE, LOOKED AT WHO WE HAVEN'T PENGAGED, ON AND ON. HOPEFULLY YOU CONCLUDE THAT WE NEED A BIT MORE TIME TO GET THIS RIGHT. IF THAT FAILS AGAIN, I WILL HAVE AMENDMENTS RELATED TO SPECIFICS OF THE ORDINANCE INCLUDING RESTRICTIONS ON LOCATION OF DESIGNATED CONSUMPTION FACILITIES AND THEIR PROXIMITY TO EACH OTHER, ON CREATING AN ADVISORY BOARD, SIMILAR TO WHAT BOULDER HAS ADOPTED AND PERHAPS OTHERS. SO I HAVE USED MY TIME NOW, AND I HAVE QUESTIONS, AND IF THERE'S TIME, I WILL GET TO THOSE LATER. THANKS.
00:24:55.972: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
00:24:56.839: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, MAYOR TAYLOR. AND THANK YOU TO STAFF FOR PUTTING THIS TOGETHER. THERE HASN'T BEEN OBVIOUSLY AS MUCH TIME AS WE WOULD LIKE TO DISCUSS THIS. IN FACT, I'M ON MY HEELS AFTER LISTENING TO MY COLLEAGUES, COUNCILMEMBER LUMM DESCRIBE THE SITUATION, AND MAYBE I'M A LITTLE NAIVE BUT I DON'T HAVE THE SKY IS FALLING FEELING ABOUT DISCUSSING THIS AND MOVING FORWARD. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN TALKED ABOUT IN OUR COMMUNITY AND OUR STATE AND OUR COUNTRY FOR A VERY LONG TIME. WE HAVE MEDICAL CENTERS THAT HAVE BEEN IN THE COMMUNITY FOR ALMOST TEN YEARS. YOU KNOW, I THINK -- I TAKE A DIFFERENT POSITION ON THIS THAN YOU DO. I THINK WE ARE DOING OUR DUE DILIGENCE. WE ARE HAVING A WORK SESSION. WE ARE TAKING TIME SO THAT WE HAVE THE PUBLIC HEARINGS AND THE PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT, WE ARE LISTENING TO OUR RESIDENTS, OUR BUSINESS OWNERS, OUR COMMUNITY LEADERS. AND THE JURY IS STILL OUT BUT TO SLAM THE DOOR ON THIS DISCUSSION BEFORE WE HAVE THIS PROCESS, I THINK ISN'T DOING OUR DUE PROCESS. SO I PUSH BACK ON THAT A LITTLE BIT. I DO HAVE CONCERNS, YOU KNOW, COMPETITIVE PROCESS IS A CONCERN. BUT FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND, DURING FIRST TWO YEARS, AND CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG, I'M OFTEN WRONG, THAT THE -- THE PERMITS ARE GOING TO BE GOING TO THE MEDICAL PROVISION CENTERS THAT ARE CURRENTLY LICENSED BY THE STATE. IS THAT CORRECT?
00:26:50.419: >> WELL, IT IS CORRECT THAT YOU HAVE TO BE A LICENSED FACILITY OWNER TO APPLY. SO THAT WOULD MEAN -- WELL, AT LEAST ONE MEANING OF THAT IS THAT IT DOESN'T CLARIFY THAT THEY HAVE TO ALREADY BE IN ANN ARBOR. SO SOMEBODY WHO HAS A LICENSED FACILITY IN SOME OTHER LOCATION MAY BE ABLE TO APPLY HERE BUT THEY ALL HAVE TO BE LICENSED AND THAT'S IN THE STATE LAW AND THAT PREFERENCE IS GRANTED BY STATUTE.
00:27:16.812: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: OKAY. SOME OF THE ISSUES -- AND, AGAIN, YOU KNOW, WE CAN CONTINUE TO AMEND OUR ORDINANCES. SO I HIGHLY DOUBT THAT WHATEVER WE PASS, IF WE PASS SOMETHING TO OPT IN, IS NEVER GOING TO BE TOUCHED. IT WILL CONTINUOUSLY BE AMENDED AND CHANGED AS TIME AND UNDERSTANDING OF EVOLVES. AND WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE STATE -- WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT LAWS AND REGULATION, I'M -- I'M THE ONE TO THINK THAT PERHAPS THAT SHOULD BE COMING FROM THE STATE LEGISLATOR AND THIS BODY OF GOVERNMENT NECESSARILY. I DON'T THINK THAT WE'LL NECESSARILY HAVE A PATCH WORK OF DIFFERENT LAWS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. YOU KNOW, REGULATING THAT. I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE BROUGHT FORTH BY THE FOLKS IN LANSING. BUT M MY CONCERNS ARE A FEW THIS OF THE FIRST ARE THE CAPS AND THE LIMITS, THE 28. IT JUST SEEMS THAT THE FOLKS THAT GOT IN EARLY AND ARE NOW IN BUSINESS, HAVE A MON MOW MOPLY - MONOPOLY ON THE INDUSTRY AND I FEEL CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. SO THAT HAS TO BE DISCUSSED AND, YOU KNOW, THE SOCIAL INJUSTICES THAT HAVE GONE ON FOR DECADES THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. THE RENEWABLE ENERGY, THESE GROWERS ARE HUGE ENERGY CONSUMERS. 10%, I FEEL IS WOEFULLY INADEQUATE. I FEEL IF LOCATIONS THAT ARE IN DOWNTOWN CANNOT PROVIDE THE ENERGY THAT THEY CONSUME, THEN PERHAPS THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME SORT OF A TRADE SYSTEM. BUT I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE THAT NUMBER CLOSER TO 100% AND IT STARTS MUCH HIGHER THAN 10%. ANOTHER ISSUE IS PERHAPS THE ORDER, THE NUANCE THAT THESE FACILITIES CREATE. AND IT'S NOT JUST FROM THE SMOKING OF IT, BUT THECTUAL CULTIVATION. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOMETHING IN THE ORDINANCES TO ADDRESS THE ORDER THAT COMES FROM. AND, YOU KNOW, AGAIN BACK TO THE SOCIAL JUSTICE ISSUES I FEEL LIKE THERE SHOULD BE MORE MANDATED INTO PROGRAMS SUCH AS FOR RECOVERY AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND MAYBE SOME OTHER HEALTH SERVICES, BUT THERE STANDS TO BE A HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY AND THAT WE SHOULD TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THAT NOW BECAUSE THAT'S GOING TO BE A LOT HARDER TO GET INTO OUR POCKETS LATER AND MIGHT AS WELL GET IT IN NOW. AND SO I THINK THAT WOULD HELP TO SOLVE SOME OF THE SOCIAL INJUSTICE ISSUES THAT I HAVE WITH IT. AND I RESERVE THE REST OF MY TIME. THANK YOU.
00:30:31.407: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
00:30:32.608: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. I WOULD LIKE TO GET -- AND I THINK SOME DATA MIGHT HELP. I KNOW WE HAD THIS LAST TIME, WHEN WE PUT THE CAP ON 28, I THINK THIS WAS A MAP AT SOME POINT OF GIVING THE ZONING RESTRICTIONS. HOW MANY PLACES WHERE THERE ACTUALLY COULD BE GIVEN THE 600 FEET FROM ONE ANOTHER AND 1,000 FEET FROM SCHOOLS, WHERE THEY EVEN COULD BE LOCATED.
00:31:02.972: >> THERE CERTAINLY ARE THOSE RESTRICTIONS, THE 28 -- MY RECOLLECTION WAS IT WAS A COMBINATION OF SORT OF VIABLE LOCATIONS, AS WELL AS SOME CONSIDERATION OF THE HISTORY OF DISPENSARIES AND OPERATIONS IN THE CITY. AND TO SOME EXTENT AN ANTICIPATION OF MARKET DEMAND IN THE CITY. SO I THINK IT WAS FOR A VARIETY OF FACTORS, BUT I HAVEN'T DOPPLER RADAR ANY UPDATED MAP FOR THIS ANALYSIS.
00:31:32.201: >> Councilmember Grand: OKAY. SO MAYBE THAT'S SOMETHING WE COULD LOOK AT SOME POINT WOULD BE GREAT BECAUSE I'M -- YOU KNOW, NOT SURE. I THINK WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT THIS WITH THE CAP AND CAPPING, 28, 28, 28, WITH SOME OF THEM TO BE FOUND. I THINK THAT WOULD HELP TO INFORM OUR CONVERSATION. AND I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S YOU MR. LENART OR YOU MR. McDONALD CAN HELP. I KNOW THERE WAS A CONCERN RAISED BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM ABOUT REGULATIONS BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT MUCH OF THE COMPLIANCE HAPPENS BY THE STATE IN TERMS OF ONCE THEY ARE GIVE ON A LICENSE, THAT ALL OF THESE, YOU KNOW, DIFFERENT FACILITIES WOULD STILL BE INSPECTED, REGULATED BY THE STATE, BECAUSE THE LICENSING PROCESS. SO CAN YOU -- CAN MAYBE SOMEONE HELP ME UNDERSTAND SORT OF WHERE THAT LINE IS, IN TERMS OF OUR RESPONSIBILITIES WITH COMPLIANCE FROM THE CITY VERSUS THE STATE RESPONSIBILITIES  FOR COMPLIANCE FROM THE STATE?
00:32:40.135: >> SURE. WE -- THAT -- DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF COMPLIANCE ARE MEASURED I ABOUT DIFFERENT PARTIES, AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT. TYPICALLY THE EXPERIENCE OF THE CITY HAS GONE THROUGH A PROCESS WHERE THE FIRST STEP HAS BEEN LAND USE. THAT IS, IS THE LOCATION APPROPRIATE? IS THE ZONING APPROPRIATE? SOMETIMES THAT REQUIRES A PLANNING COMMISSION ACTION. SOMETIMES IT'S AS SIMPLE AS VERIFYING THE ZONING DISTRICT IS APPROPRIATE FOR THE USE ANTICIPATED. FROM THAT, THE PETITIONER OR THE APPLICANT OR THE BUSINESS OWNER IS TYPICALLY GOING TO TAKE THAT INFORMATION AND START A COUPLE OF APPLICATION PROCESSES THAT GO FROM OUR OFFICE, NEXT DOOR TO THE BUILDING DEPARTMENT WHERE THEY START COMPLIANCE WITH BUILDING CODES. SO THAT IS WHERE WE ARE LOOKING AT SAFETY, WE'RE LOOKING AT THE FIRE CODE. WE ARE LOOKING AT HOW THAT PHYSICAL BUSINESS IS BEING DEVELOPED AND OPERATED TO MEET BASIC HEALTH AND SAFETY CODES THAT ARE SPECIFIED BY ALL OF OUR APPLICABLE BUILDING CODES. THEN ON A BASIS, THEY ARE GOING FROM THAT -- FROM THAT, THEY WILL TAKE THAT SATISFACTORY COMPLETION, WHICH IS ULTIMATELY US MAKING THAT DETERMINATION THAT THEY MEET ALL OF THOSE BUILDING CODE REQUIREMENTS. THEY ARE GOING TO APPLY TO THE CLERK FOR A PERMIT UNDER OUR CHAPTER 96. THEY ARE GOING TO APPLY IT TO STATE FOR A STATE LICENSE. THE STATE IS -- I HAVE HEARD -- I'M NOT EXPERT, BUT I HEARD OF A DOIQUE INSPECTORS COMING THROUGH A SINGLE PROVISIONING CENTER LOOKING AT UNIQUE ASPECTS OF THAT PROVISIONING CENTER FROM THE STATE FOR ALL THE RULES THAT HAVE BEEN SET UP AT THE STATE LEVEL. AT THE CULMINATION OF THAT SATISFACTION, THAT IS THE TRIGGER BY WHICH THEN THE CLERK'S OFFICE IS GOING TO RELEASE OUR LOCAL PERMIT THAT ALL OF THAT HAS BEEN SATISFIED. SO IT IS A COMBINATION. WE TEND TO LOOK AT THE LAND USE THAT IS THE NATURE OF THE BUSINESSES THAT ARE APPROPRIATELY LOCATED AND THEN WE LOOK AT IT FROM A VERY TECHNICAL BUILDING CODE PERSPECTIVE. DOES IT MEET THE APPLICABLE BUILDING CODES FOR THAT TYPE OF USE IN THAT SPACE? THEN THE STATE IS DOING THE MONITORING OF SAFETY AND SECURITY AND MONITORING AND IS ADEQUATELY INVENTORIES FROM SEED TO SALE? AND THAT I ANTICIPATE IS GOING TO CONTINUE WITH THE RECREATION BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF REQUIREMENTS THAT EVEN THOUGH YOU MIGHT HAVE COLLOCATION OF SOME OF THOSE FACILITIES THEY STILL HAVE TO MAINTAIN AN INDEPENDENCE IN THE OPERATION. SO IT'S A PARTNERSHIP. I WOULD SAY MOST OF THE INSIDE OF BUILDING REGULATION IS DONE BY THE STATE AND MOST OF THE LOCATIONAL BUILDING OR FRAMEWORK IS DONE BY THE CITY.
00:35:16.458: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. THAT'S HELPFUL. JUST AN ASIDE, THAT'S SOMEWHAT RELATED TO THIS. I WAS LOOKING AT OUR NEWS FROM THE ATTORNEYS -- I WAS LOOKING AT THE OUTDOOR SMOKING ORDINANCE AND IT DOESN'T INCLUDE MARIJUANA PROBABLY WAS IT WAS NOT LEGAL AT THE TIME, BUT SOMETHING THAT WE MIGHT WANT TO LOOK INTO, BECAUSE I THINK IT'S --
00:35:36.845: >> AS DRAFTED WE PROHIBIT ANY OUTSIDE ACTIVITIES FOR ANY FACILITY.
00:35:42.517: >> Councilmember Grand: YEAH. BUT IT SPECIFICALLY SAYS -- I KNOW LIKE IN PARKS, FOR EXAMPLE, CIGARETTES, ECIGARETTES AND SO WE HAVE A VAPING AND CIGARETTE SMOKING, CIGAR SMOKING BAN BUT WE DON'T TO OUR KNOWLEDGE HAVE SPECIFIC LANGUAGE FOR MARIJUANA.
00:35:56.298: >> ALSO THE LAW DOES REQUIRE THAT IT CAN'T OCCUR IN A PUBLIC SPACE.
00:36:03.572: >> Councilmember Grand: I DON'T KNOW, IT COULDN'T HURT -- IT'S A CONCERN I HEAR A LOT FROM MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC.
00:36:14.349: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
00:36:15.550: >> Councilmember Lumm: I HAVE A FOLLOW-ON TO THE INSPECTION Q&A. I DID SUBMIT A QUESTION ABOUT THAT. I WOULD LIKE YOU TO POINT OUT WHERE YOU JUST DESCRIBED -- [ OFF MICROPHONE COMMENTS ]
00:36:31.199: >> NO. I -- [ OFF MICROPHONE COMMENTS ]
00:36:40.609: >> Councilmember Lumm: NO INSPECT CONS AND IN TERMS THE INSPECTION PROCESS, THERE'S NOTHING DESCRIBED ABOUT THE CITY'S PROCESS, ONLY THE STATE WITH RESPECT TO FACILITIES PART OF THE LICENSURE PROCESS. SO IT'S VERY DIFFERENT, BASED ON THAT RESPONSE, ANY WAY. I TAKE IT -- IT WAS NOTHING LIKE WHAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED AND I CAN'T FIEN FIND ANY ORDINANCE TT YOU JUST DESCRIBES. THE PROCESS FOR THE -- [ OFF MICROPHONE COMMENTS ] TO GET BACK TO THE CONTRARY, THE STATE LICENSING PROCESS. YOU HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING SPECIALA SPECIAL, ACCORDING TO S RENOON WE DON'T DO ANY OTHER INSPECTION OF MARIJUANA FOR --
00:37:31.727: >> Councilmember Lumm: FOR LIQUOR PERMITS DO YOU.
00:37:33.428: >> FROM THE ZONING AND BUILDING DEPARTMENT. WE INSPECT IT AS T MERCANTILE USE, OR INDUSTRIAL USE OR ASSEMBLY USE. AND SO BASED ON THAT USE PROPOSED, WHAT WE HAVE TO DO WE MAKE SURE THAT THAT BUILDING IS SAFE AND CONSTRUCTED AND AND MEETS THE REQUIREMENTS OF THAT. THE CULMINATION IS THE CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY, WHETHER WE ARE ISSUING A CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY FOR A COFFEE SHOP OR MEDICAL MARIJUANA PROVISIONING CENTER, WE ARE MAKING THAT DETERMINATION THAT IT MEETS BOTH OUR LAND USE AND OUR BUILDING CODE AND FIRE CODE REQUIREMENTS WITH THE CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY AND THEN THERE'S A WHOLE HOST OF OTHER STANDARDS UNDER THE MEDICAL MARIJUANA FACILITIES AND RECREATION THAT ARE REQUIRED BY THE STATE, THAT TEND TO BE MORE FOCUSED ON OPERATIONAL ASPECTS OF THE BUSINESS, WHICH ARE OUTSIDE OF THOSE BUILDING CODES WHICH WE HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO ENFORCE. SO I APOLOGIZE. I WASN'T TRYING TO CONVEY THAT WE DON'T INSPECT THEM. WE INSPECT ANY USE PURSUANT TO THE BUILDING TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S SPECIFIC. BUT WE DON'T DO ANYTHING SPECIFIC OR ADDITIONAL FOR MARIJUANA FACILITIES THAN WE WOULD ANY OTHER BUSINESS.
00:38:42.998: >> Councilmember Lumm: AND COUNCILMEMBER GRAND AND -- [ OFF MICROPHONE COMMENT ] COUNCICOUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, WH% FOR THE ENERGY OFFSETS.
00:38:56.812: >> YES.
00:38:57.779: >> Councilmember Lumm: AND I SENT YOU THE BOULDER ORDINANCE, AND THEY REQUIRE FOR CULTIVATION FACILITIES AT LEAST -- OH, SORRY. THIS ISN'T ON, THANKS. THE CULTIVATION FACILITIES ARE REQUIRED IN BOULDER TO OFFSET 100% OF THE ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION. SO TO -- AGAIN, I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WAS A QUESTION, BUT ANYWAY TO THE QUESTION THAT --
00:39:16.998: >> I CAN JUST TELL YOU THE EVOLUTION OF THAT. WE DID LOOK AT HIGH EMMERSAGES.R PERCENTAGES.
00:39:28.977: >> WE LOOKED AT THE TYPICAL SOLAR EXPOSURE AND SORT OF SQUARE FOOTAGE, AND BASED ON THAT CONVERSATION, IT'S -- IT'S -- FOR SURE, IT'S AN INEXACT -- IT'S HARD TO SET A STANDARD FOR EVERYTHING, BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING, GIVING OUR SOLAR EXPOSURE AND -- AND OTHER FACTORS, WE ESTIMATED THAT 10% WOULD BE A REASONABLE THRESHOLD TO ACHIEVE, PRESUMING COVERAGE OF THE CORRESPONDING SQUARE FOOTAGE OF THAT SPACE HERE IN MICHIGAN. I THINK BOULDER DOES PROVIDE SOME OTHER WAYS THAT YOU CAN ACHIEVE THAT, THROUGH MAYBE PURCHASES --
00:40:10.552: >> Councilmember Lumm: I THINK I SENT YOU A PRESENTATION --
00:40:13.154: >> YEAH. AND THAT GETS INTO WHAT -- FRANKLY, WHAT MY GOAL WAS FROM THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT CODE REQUIREMENTS, TO FIND A REASONABLE ON THAT SITE STANDARD WITHOUT STARTING TO WADE INTO THE COMPLICATION OF PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION REQUIREMENTS ABOUT OUR LIMITATIONS OF DIRECTING PEOPLE HOW THEY HAVE TO GET THEIR POWER. SO IT'S A -- IT'S -- OTHER COMMUNITIES HAVE HAD A DRASTIC IMPACT FROM THESE GROW FACILITIES AND THIS WAS AN ATTEMPT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AND PUT A STAKE IN THE GROUND IN WHAT WE THOUGHT WAS AI REASONABLE -- A REASONABLE AND DEFENSIBLE MANNER.
00:40:58.967: >> Councilmember Lumm: AGAIN, IN BOULDER, THEY NEED A VERIFIED SUBSCRIPTION TO A COMMUNITY SOLAR GARDEN TO OFFSET 100% OF THEIR USE AND PERHAPS YOU CAN COME BACK WIT THIS, SOME SUGGESTIONS FOR MAYBE THERE ARE WAYS TO CONTRIBUTE TO -- TO OFFSETS, LIKE WE DO WITH AFFORDABLE HOUSING TRUST FUND CONTRIBUTIONS IF THEY CAN'T DO IT ON SITE. BECAUSE I KNOW, FOR EXAMPLE -- AND THERE ARE CERTAINLY OPPORTUNITIES THERE. YOU KNOW, WE ARE GOING TO BE DOING THIS SOLAR GARDEN FIELD, WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT, ARRAY, POTENTIALLY AT THE MUNICIPAL AIRPORT. AND I UNDERSTAND THAT'S A 40 -- WE ARE GOING TO REPAY D.T.E. $44 MILLION FOR THAT AND WE DON'T HAVE A FINANCIAL PLAN FOR THAT, THAT I'M AWARE OF. SO THERE'S SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES FOR THESE LUCRATIVE BUSINESSES TO HELP OFFSET THEIR ENERGY CONSUMPTION BY MAKING PERHAPS FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO THAT. SINCE WE NEED TO COME ONE SOME FINANCIAL PLANS FOR THAT ARRAY AT LEAST.
00:42:05.033: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. McDONALD?
00:42:05.700: >> I JUST WANTED TO QUICKLY RESPOND, I THINK TO TWO QUESTIONS FROM BOTH COUNCILMEMBER GRAND AND COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THE CITY DOESN'T USUALLY ADOPT ORDINANCES OR ORDINANCED THAT SORT OF REPEAT REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE IN THE STATE LAW. AND SO SIMILARLY, I WOULDUST LIKE TO SAY IN TERMS OF ING, WE CERTAINLY WITHIN OUR CHAPTER 96 LICENSING ALLOWF. I'M NOT SAYING CITY INSPECTIONS HAVE TAKEN PLACE BUT THAT'S ALLOWED FOR IN THE LICENSING PROVISION. IT'S NEVER OUR INTENTION TO REPLACE AND/OR -- IT'S REALLY JUST A SUPPLEMENT BUT WE ARE REALLY NOT REPLACING THE SUBSTANTIAL DUE DILIGENCE AND INSPECTIONS THAT THE STATE IS DOING REGARDING THEIR REQUIREMENTS. SIMILARLY, I WANT TO SAY TO COUNCILMEMBER GRAND. YOU MENTIONED THE SMOKING ORDINANCE BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S CLEAR, THERE'S ALL KINDS OF PROVISIONS OF THE STATE LAW WHERE THINGS ARE ACT LOUED AND NOT ALLOWED. WE DON'T NECESSARILY PULL THEM -- ARE BEING ALLOWED AND NOT ALLOWED, WE DON'T NECESSARILY PULL THEM INTO OUR LAW. SMOKING MARIJUANA IS NOT BEING MADE LEGAL HERE. IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD HAVE A PROHIBITION IN THAT REPEATS WHAT THE STATE HAS ALREADY SAID IS NOT LEGAL.
00:43:34.255: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
00:43:35.190: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES, I THINK THIS IS A Q&A. SO IF THE STATE LAW PROHIBITS SMOKING MARIJUANA IN PUBLIC AN WE ALL KNOW HOW WELL THAT WORKS IF YOU HAVE BEEN TO A MUSIC FESTIVAL OR ANYTHING, LIKE ON HART PLAZA, WHAT AUTHORITY WOULD THE LOCAL MUNICIPALITY, OUR P.D. HAVE TO ENFORCE IT? WOULD THEY HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO ENFORCE THAT SHOULD THEY CHOOSE TO? COMPLAINT DRIVEN OR HOW WOULD THAT WORK?
00:44:15.964: >> IF WE DON'T HAVE AN ORDINANCE, THEN THE POLICE WOULD ENFORCE THAT UNDER THE STATE LAW. WE COULD HAVE AN ORDINANCE AND THEN THEY WOULD PROCEED UNDER CITY LAW. SO --
00:44:26.374: >> Councilmember Hayner: OKAY. SO WHILE I HAVE YOU UP HERE. SO I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS BASED ON THE PRESENTATION. SO WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT CREATING THESE NEW RULES WE ARE TALKING ABOUT STRIKING THE WORLD "MEDICAL" AND CALLING IT SIMPLY MARIJUANA PROVISIONING.
00:44:40.889: >> YEP.
00:44:41.156: >> Councilmember Hayner:  BUT IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT MEDICAL WILL BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE, CARDHOLDERS WILL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO PURCHASE MEDICAL MARIJUANA, BUT THERE'S A STATE TAX STRUCTURE IN PLACE THAT'S DIFFERENT FOR THESE TWO. AND SO HOW ARE WE GOING TO DEFINE WHAT IS -- IS UP TO THE RETAILER TO DEFINE WHAT IS -- TO KEEP THE RECORDS ON WHAT IS A MEDICAL SALE VERSUS WHAT IS A RECREATIONAL SALE? AND IS IT BECAUSE THE TAX STRUCTURE IS DIFFERENT IN WHAT COMES BACK TO THE COMMUNITIES, DO WE HAVE ANY CONCERNS ABOUT WHAT TYPE OF SALES ARE GOING ON AS TO WHAT'S, YOU KNOW, HAPPENING AND WHAT IS GETTING LOOPED BACK TO THE CITY THROUGH STATE LAW?
00:45:28.036: >> WELL, I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE ADMINISTERED BY THE STATE AND THERE HAS TO BE -- THEY -- THEY ARE GOING TO BE SEPARATE BUSINESSES. THEY MAY BE IN THE SAME BUILDING BEING BUT THEY ARE SEPARATE. AND THAT'S BY ADMINISTRATIVE RULES REQUIRE THAT THERE BE A SEPARATION BETWEEN THE TWO. SO --
00:45:49.190: >> Councilmember Hayner:  SO THEY ARE KEE KEEPING SEPARATE BS EVEN THOUGH IT'S A CASH OPERATION.
00:45:56.431: >> I BELIEVE IT'S A SEPARATE SET OF BOOKS BUT IT'S CERTAINLY A SEPARATE INVENTORY AND EVERYTHING HAS TO BE SEPARATE IF THOSE ARE COLLOCATED BUSINESSES. STATE HAS -- YOU KNOW, THE STATE HAS PRETTY EXTENSIVE RULES REGARDING THE COLLOCATION OF THESE BUSINESSES AND THEY ARE NOT REALLY ALLOWING THINGS TO BE COMBINED IN A TRADITIONAL MANNER. SOME OF THE USES EVEN REQUIRE SEPARATE ENTRANCES AND EXITS, SUCH AS IF YOU HAVE A -- A -- A DESIGNATED CONSUMPTION FACILITY AND A RETAILER IN THE SAME LOCATION. SEPARATE ENTRANCES AND EXITS, SEPARATE INVENTORY, I BELIEVE, SEPARATE BOOKS AND RECORDS BUT IT'S REALLY KIND OF COMPLETE SEPARATION.
00:46:40.508: >> Councilmember Hayner: OKAY. SO WHEN COUNCILMEMBER LUMM SPOKE OF THIS MARIJUANA REVIEW BOARD, I KNOW I SIT ON THE LIQUOR LICENSE REVIEW BOARD WITH HER. AND SO THERE'S A CASE WHERE WE HAVE LOCAL RULES AND SOME LOCAL AUTHORITY. WE HAVE GRANTED OURSELVES SOME LOCAL AUTHORITY, EVEN THOUGH IT'S A STATE LICENSING PROCESS. WE DO THAT FOR -- WE HAVE A BUILDING REVIEW BOARD FOR THE STATE LICENSED BUILDING ACTIVITIES. SO IS THERE ANY REASON WE WOULDN'T HAVE THIS FOR OVERSEEING THE -- THIS MARIJUANA LICENSING, EVEN THOUGH IT'S A STATE LICENSE. WHY WOULDN'T WE GIVE OURSELVES SOME AUTHORITY OVER THAT? I NO H KNOW WITH LIQUOR LICENSEF THE POLICE HAVE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF CALLS TO THE FACILITY, WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO INTERJECT WITH THE STATE'S LICENSE AND SAY THIS IS NOT WORKING OUT IN OUR COMMUNITY. WE WANT TO PULL OUR LICENSE. IS THAT AUTHORITY NOT GIVEN TO US UNDER THE STATE LAWS?
00:47:42.603: >> I WOULD SAY RIGHT NOW, THERE IS NOT A PROCESS LIKE THAT UNDER THE STATE LAW. WE CAN ALWAYS MAKE A COMPLAINT, AND IF THERE IS A PROBL WITH A PARTICULAR BUSINESS, I THINK WE WOULD.
00:47:57.285: >> AND PART OF THE PURPOSE OF THE CITY HAVING A PERMIT SECTION IS THE CITY HAS THE ABILITY WITHIN THAT PERMIT SECTION IF SOMEBODY IS IN VIOLATION WITHIN OUR ORDINANCE TO REVOKE THE PERMIT. AND THAT WOULD -- AND THAT WOULD BE COMMUNICATED TO THE STATE, WHERE WE WOULD INDICATE THAT THEY NO LONGER HAVE THE ABILITY TO OPERATE HERE.
00:48:16.437: >> Councilmember Hayner: WELL, IT SEEMS LIKE THE BOARD WOULD BE A GOOD PLACE FOR THAT TO FUNCTION. I MEAN, AT THE VERY LEAST, WE COULD GO COUNT THE SOLAR PANELS, YOU KNOW? IT JUST SEEMS LIKE IT WOULD BE WORTH WHILE TO HAVE A BOARD TO OVERSEE THESE PERMITS. WE DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH LIQUOR LICENSES AND IT HAS OTHER KINDS OF OTHER BENEFITS TO THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY AND TO THE BUSINESS OWNERS. I MEAN, ARE LIKER LICENSES CAPPED HERE IN THE CITY? IN ANY MEANINGFUL WAY? IT'S ACCORDING TO STATE LAW. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THERE ARE QUOTAS. THERE'S SOME TYPES, AND --
00:48:53.941: >> I MEAN THE D.D.A., I KNOW WHAT THEIR FUNCTION IS.
00:48:57.678: >> YEAH.
00:48:57.945: >> Councilmember Hayner:  WE HAVE APPROVED SOME OF THOSE LICENSES. I JUST WONDER IF IT'S ANALOGOUS AND SOMETHING TO LOOK AT WHEN WE CONSIDER THE AMOUNTS THAT ARE HELD. LET'S SEE WHAT ELSE I HAVE HERE. I WILL PASS AND I'M SURE MORE WILL COME UP, IF THAT'S OKAY. THANK YOU.
00:49:13.127: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
00:49:14.262: >> Councilmember Nelson: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER MOSTLY ASKED THE QUESTION THAT I HAD, BUT I -- SOME OF THE RESPONSE THAT YOU GOT, ACTUALLY TRIGGERED SOME MORE QUESTIONS FOR ME. MR. McDONALD, YOU SAID THAT -- YOU SAID THAT EVEN WITHOUT A BOARD, WE COULD COMMUNICATE TO THE E THAT AN OPERATOR WAS IN VIOLATION AND WE WANTED THEM TO REMOVE THEIR STATE --
00:49:44.525: >> WE ARE GRANTING PERMITS AND THERE'S AIL SECTION IN THE ORDINANCE AND IT'S BEEN IN THE ORDINANCE FROM THE MEDICAL MARIJUANA FACILITIES WERE PRESENT THAT ALLOWS -- EXCUSE ME, FOR THE CITY TO REVOKE PERMITS AND THEY HAVE TO CONTINUE TO COMPLY WITH THE STATE LAW. AND SO THAT IS A TOOL THAT IS AVAILABLE TO THE CITY AND I -- I WASN'T REALLY TRYING TO SPEAK TOWARDS WHETHER THAT WAS A BOARD IMPLEMENTING THAT TOOL OR SOMEONE ELSE. I WAS JUST TRYING TO SPEAK TO THE TOOL ITSELF.
00:50:25.566: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I DON'T SIT ON THE LIQUOR LICENSE. I WAS GOOGLING TO SEE WHERE A LIQUOR LICENSE WAS REVOKED. I'M LOOKING AT THE STANDARDS THAT WE'RE APPLYING, AND -- I MEANMEAN, APART FROM SOMETHING REALLY CUT AND DRY, LIKE FAILING TO PAY TAXES IN ORDER TO REMAIN COMPLIANT, ARE THERE ANY CIRCUMSTANCE UNDER THIS ORDINANCE AS PROPOSED WHERE, FOR INSTANCE, A FACILITY JUST HAD CREATES A NUISANCE IN A NEIGHBORHOOD AND, LICENSE COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER SUGGESTED, YOU KNOW, THERE WERE LOTS OF POLICE CALLS WITHOUT --
00:51:03.137: >> Councilmember Hayner:  SALE TO MINORS.
00:51:04.272: >> Councilmember Nelson: YEAH, SOMETHING LIKE THAT. I MEAN I GUESS THAT STRIKES ME AS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR A REVIEW BOARD OF -- OF PEOPLE TO CONSIDER SOMETHING THAT'S NOT JUST A PIECE OF PAPER SAYING THEY OWE $3,000 ON TAXES THAT THEY DIDN'T PAY. SORT OF BROADER CIRCUMSTANCES THAT NEED TO BE JUDGED BY PEOPLE RATHER THAN A CALCULATOR. I MEAN, DO YOU FOLLOW WHAT I'M SAYING? SO I'M LOOKING AT THESE STANDARDS. SO PAST PERFORMANCE EXPERIENCE WITH THE COMMUNITY BUSINESS PLANS, STATE COMPLIANCE AND POINTS FOR EACH OF THESE FOUR CATEGORCATEGORY. WOULD THAT APPLY FOR A RENEWAL OF A PERMIT. OR WOULD IT RENEW IF YOU MAINTAINED YOUR STATE LICENSE.
00:51:53.888: >> ARE YOU REFERRING TO THE COMPETITIVE LICENSE FOR THE ISSUANCE OF A PERMIT.
00:51:58.259: >> NO, I'M ASKING ABOUT A RENEWAL OF A PERMIT. I'M PIGGYBACKING ON COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER'S QUESTION, IN TERMS OF THE POWER THAT THE LIQUOR LICENSE HAS, WHEN A LIQUOR LICENSE ISN'T WORKING OUT. THAT'S MY QUESTION.
00:52:19.714: >> IF THAT'S THE COMPETITIVE PROCESS WE SET UP --
00:52:22.416: >> IN THE RENEWAL PROCESS.
00:52:24.218: >> IN THE RENEWAL PROCESS, YES.
00:52:28.789: >> OKAY. THANK YOU.
00:52:31.792: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
00:52:32.660: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANKS FOR THE SECOND OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. I JUST WANTED TO ASK BRETT REAL QUICK, AND I KNOW YOU ARE NOT THE FIRE MARSHAL, BUT THE FIRE DEPARTMENT HAS DONE A PRETTY VIGOROUS JOB A OF LATE INSPECTING BUILDINGS THROUGHOUT OUR CITY; IS THAT CORRECT? IS IT DONE YEARLY, ANNUALLY?
00:52:55.082: >> THE FIRE DEPARTMENT ENFORCES THE FIRE SAFETY CODE. SO SOMETIMES THAT'S REGULAR INSPECTIONS. IT'S ALSO REVIEW OF NEW DEVELOPMENTS.
00:53:02.890: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: OKAY. I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WAS A VERY ENFORCEABLE INSPECTION. AND THEN THAT'S ALL I REALLY HAVE. I'M SORRY. I WISH I HAD MORE, BUT I DO SIT ON THE LIQUOR LICENSE REVIEW BOARD AS WELL, AND IT'S A FUN BOARD TO BE ON. IT'S NOT A TIME SUCK, BUT YOU LEARN QUICK THAT OUR POWERS ARE VERY LIMITED AS A CITY. AND MOST OF THAT LIES IN LANSING. SO WHEN WE GO AHEAD WITH OUR COMPETITIVE PROCESS, WE ARE GOING TO REALLY NEED -- IF WE GO FORWARD WITH IT, MORE TEETH IN THAT REVIEW PROCESS. CURRENTLY IT'S VERY HARD TO REVOKE THE CITY LIQUOR LICENSE. IT COULD BE A LOT OF COMPLAINTS, AND VERY LITTLE CAN GET DONE. I SUGGEST MODELING A REVIEW BOARD. AND THE SAME PEOPLE. IT'S SUCH A LIGHT LOAD AND IT COULD USE -- IF YOU USE THE CALENDAR CORRECT, IT COULD DO BOTH, IN MY OPINION. AND IT'S A VERY GOOD BODY, BECAUSE THERE YOU HAVE THE BUILDING DEPARTMENT, THE FIRE, THE POLICE, THE CITY, THE TREASURER, EVERYBODY IS LISTENING AND REVIEWING THESE APPLICATIONS, AND EACH DEPARTMENT GETS TO REVIEW IT, COME TO THE TABLE AND SAY, YOU KNOW WHAT, THEY DIDN'T PASS THEIR BUILDING INSPECTION. THEY DIDN'T PAY THEIR TAXES. THEY HAVE HAD 100 CALLS IN THE LAST YEAR. BAR. AND THEN AS A BODY WE CAN MAKE A RECOMMENDATION WHEN ALL OF THESE FACETS OF OUR CITY GOVERNMENT COME TOGETHER TO REVIEW THE LICENSE AND THE APPLICATION. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND IT AND I REALLY DO BELIEVE THE PEOPLE THAT SIT ON THE LICENSE FOR THE LIQUOR LICENSE CAN DO THIS TASK. I WON'T TAKE UP ANY MORE TIME.
00:55:16.323: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
00:55:17.191: >> Councilmember Hayner:  IT'S NOT LIKE A PUNITIVE BOARD OR ANYTHING. IT'S LIKE WE COME IN AND WE TALK TO EVERYBODY. WE FIND OUT WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THE BUSINESS, WHY IS THERE A PROBLEM TO THE BUSINESS. WHY THERE ARE COMPLAINTS IN THE COMMUNITY AND THEN WE SEND THE APPROPRIATE PEOPLE TO DISCUSS IT WITH THE OWNER. WE WANT TO SOLVE THESE BUSINESSES AND WE WANT THEM TO HAVE A SMALL COMMUNITY BUSINESS HERE IN TOWN. IT'S NOT A PUNITIVE ASPECT AND I THINK IT IS ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE AND I THINK THAT IT -- YOU KNOW TO HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THAT. AND I THINK IT WILL GIVE US AN OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE A PLACE FOR OUTREACH WITH THIS NEW TYPE OF BUSINESS THAT WE'RE ALLOWING TO POTENTIALLY FLOURISH HERE IN THE CITY. I THINK IT'S ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE TO HAVE ONE. SO MAYBE COUNCILMEMBER LUMM AND ALI, WE CAN FORM SOMETHING. IT'S ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE THAT IT SITS ON THAT BOARD WITH THE SAME TYPE OF MAKEUP BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, THE CLERK IS THE KEY TO THAT, AND THE CLERK IS IN CHARGE OF PERMITS AND SHE'S IN CHARGE OF THE LIQUOR LICENSE REVIEW BOARD.
00:56:25.426: >> Mayor Taylor: I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS BASED UPON THE PRESENTATION. I GUESS JUST CYCLING BACK FROM THE LAST CONVERSATION, THE APPLICATION CRITERIA ARE -- HAVE BEEN ARTICULATED, THAT IS THE FOUR 25-POINT NODES, DO WE HAVE AN ESTABLISHED CRITERIA FORNEWA. IT SEEMS THESE CRITERIA WOULDN'T MAKE MUCH SENSE FOR RENEWALS. THE LOCATION, YOU KNOW, THAT'S NOT GOING TO SHIFT.
00:57:01.729: >> NO. AS I REALLY SAID, WE WANTED TO KIND OF SHOW YOU THAT KIND OF AS AN OUTLINE.
00:57:07.368: >> Mayor Taylor: UNDERSTOOD. AND FOR APPLICATIONS THAT MAKES SENSE.
00:57:09.403: >> WE HAVE NOT DEVELOPED THE FULL POINT SYSTEM.
00:57:12.840: >> Mayor Taylor: UNDERSTOOD.
00:57:13.440: >> SO SIMILAR TO RENEWALS THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT.
00:57:16.577: >> Mayor Taylor: PERFECT. SO THE RENEWAL CRITERIA WILL ULTIMATELY BE SEPARATE FROM THE APPLICATION CRITERIA?
00:57:23.417: >> SEPARATE OR INCLUDED WITHIN. SO, YES.
00:57:27.888: >> Councilmember Lumm: WITH IS THAT?
00:57:33.794: >> Mayor Taylor: WHERE IS THAT?
00:57:35.529: >> Mayor Taylor: THERE'S SOME OTHER POINTS WITH REFERENCE TO FUNDING AND THE OPPORTUNITY FOR MUNICIPAL REVENUE AND THE LIKE FROM THIS LINE OF -- THIS LINE OF NEW BUSINESSES. I WOULD BE GRATEFUL IF SOMEONE ON STAFF COULD ARTICULATE FOR FOLKS ON COUNCIL AND FOR THE COMMUNITY WHAT THE -- WHAT TAXES AND FEES AND THE LIKE COME TO THE MUNICIPAL ORGANIZATION.
00:57:59.320: >> City Admin. Lazarus: SO THE LICENSING FEES ARE $5,000 PER LICENSE.
00:58:05.192: >> Mayor Taylor: MM-HMM.
00:58:05.726: >> City Admin. Lazarus: AND THAT'S THE MAXIMUM THAT'S ALLOWED UNDER THE STATE STATUTE UNDER THE LAW RIGHT NOW. WE ALSO GET A PERCENTAGE OF THE TAXES ON SALES OF ADULT USE. I DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S POSSIBLE TO FORECAST WHAT THAT WILL BE RIGHT NOW. SO WE -- AS A MATTER OF GENERAL POLICY, WE DON'T -- IT'S A MATTER OF PRACTICE, WE DON'T COUNT REVENUES UNTIL WE HAVE A YEAR'S EXPERIENCE. SO WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT WILL BE. AND WE WILL HAVE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH PEOPLE IN COLORADO AND EUGENE, OREGON, THAT WILL ADDRESS SOME ADDITIONAL POLICE STAFFING AND SOME EQUIPMENT THAT, AGAIN, SOME OF THIS IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE MID-YEAR ADJUSTMENT AS COUNCILMEMBER LUMM TALKED ABOUT. CHIEF COX AND I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT WITH THE CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE, BUT THERE WILL HAVE TO BE SOME ADJUSTMENTS AS WE GO THROUGH IT. CITIES THAT HAVE GONE THROUGH THIS, HAVE EXPERIENCED SOME INCREASES IN ARMED ROBBERIES SINCE IT IS A CASH BUSINESS. THERE ARE SOME ADDITIONAL COSTS THAT DEAL WITH EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS AND THOSE KIND OF RELATED MEDICAL COSTS. I DON'T THINK MOST OF THAT IS RELATED TO THE CITY. WE DO HAVE INSPECTION FEES FOR THE FIRE DEPARTMENT TO INSPECT COMMERCIAL ESTABLISHMENTS. THERE MAY BE SOME REQUIREMENT FOR ADDITIO ADDITIONAL FIRE INSS WELL. AS MUCH AS WE WANT TO HAVE CERTAINTY BEFORE WE GET POSSIBLE, I DON'T THINK THAT'S POSSIBLE. IT WILL BE A YEAR OR TWO OF ADDITIONAL COST UNTIL WE PROBABLY SEE THE SALES TAX REVENUE COME BACK TO THE CITY AND I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU CAN SAY WHETHER IT WILL COVER THE ADDITIONAL COSTS OR NOT.
00:59:52.966: >> Mayor Taylor: WHAT IS THE SALES TAX PERCEE IF WE DON'T KNOW THE ABSOLUTE AMOUNT?
01:00:06.847: >> THE EXCISE TAX WILL BE 10% OF THE SALES PRICE.
01:00:10.317: >> Councilmember Hayner:  IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE MUNICIPALITIES  THAT ALLOW THE OPERATIONS GET 15% OF THE 10% OF THE EXCISE TAX AND THAT MEANS FOR $1 MILLION IN SALES WE GET $15,000.
01:00:23.497: >> City Admin. Lazarus: IT'S BASED UPON THE NUMBER OF FACILITIES, THOUGH THAT --
01:00:26.266: >> Councilmember Hayner:  AND THERE'S ANOTHER VARIABLE IN THERE.
01:00:28.469: >> City Admin. Lazarus: YES. SO I THINK THE 15%, I BELIEVE, IS CORRECT FOR THE MUNICIPALITY, BUT IT'S BASED UPON THE TOTAL COLLECTION AND THE TOTAL NUMBER OF FACILITIES THAT EXIST. SO WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S
01:11:28.660: >> Councilmember Lumm: A PROVISIONING CENTER AND THE RESPONSE WAS THAT THEY DID NOT THINK THAT HAVING A MINIMUM PARKING REQUIREMENT FOR CARS WAS IMPORTANT. THE ORDINANCE DOES REQUIRE A MINIMUM NUMBER OF BIKE SPACES, BUT WHY DO WE REQUIRE MINIMUMS FOR BARS -- AGAIN, I'M LOOKING AT EQUITY THERE, BUT NOT FOR DESIGNATED MARIJUANA CONSUMPTION FACILITIES?
01:11:50.049: >> I THINK THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION. I THINK WE SHOULD LOOK AT BARS. I THINK WE SHOULD LOOK AT BARS AS WELL.
01:12:10.703: >> WE HAVE IDENTIFIED AS LOOKING AT PARKING CHANGES AS POTENTIAL ORDINANCE CHANGES. THERE'S A LOT OF EVOLVING THOUGHT ABOUT PARKING REQUIREMENTS IN COMMUNITIES, SPECIFICALLY THAT WHEN COMMUNITIES START SETTING MINIMUM PARKING STANDARDS, GENERALLY, WE ARE ADDING TO THE COST OF DEVELOPMENT AND WE ARE SORT OF FOREVER --
01:12:31.357: >> Councilmember Lumm: SORRY. YOU ARE GOING TO GO DOWN THAT PATH.
01:12:34.294: >> SO IN THIS CIRCUMSTANCE, I DON'T -- I AGREE. I THINK THAT THERE IS A SIMILARITY AND EQUITY TO LOOK AT BARS AND CONSUMPTION FACILITIES AS A NEW USE, BOTH STAFF AND PLANNING COMMISSION THOUGHT THIS THE PRIMARY USE OF THE FACILITY AND IT MIGHT BE MORE OF A COMBINATION OF FOOD AND DRINK WAS CONSUMPTION OF MARIJUANA AND -- BUT WE ARE NOT PROHIBITING PARKING FOR THE CITY TO REQUIRE THAT A CERTAIN NUMBER OF VEHICULAR SPACES BE ASSOCIATED WITH THAT USE, IT -- IT JUST WASN'T ELEVATED TO A PRIORITY. SO THAT'S WHY WE CITE AT A MAXIMUM.
01:13:13.933: >> Councilmember Lumm: I'M A LITTLE SURPRISED AT YOUR RESPONSE. I HAVE BEEN A MEMBER OF THE LIQUOR ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR QUITE A FEW YEARS NOW, AND I APPRECIATE THAT COUNCILMEMBERS RAMLAWI AND HAYNER AND NELSON WHO IS NOT ON THE LIQUOR ADVISORY COMMITTEE APPRECIATE THAT -- I RESENT IT TO EVERYONE, I SENT IT TO YOU LAST WEEK, THE CITY -- BOULDER CITY ATTORNEY MEMO ABOUT TREATING THESE TYPES OF BUSINESSES SIMILARLY. THAT PROCESS WAS SET UP BEFORE I ARRIVED AT COUNCIL AND IT ENABLES THE CITY TO ACCRUE TAXES, UNPAID LIQUOR LICENSE FEES, YOU KNOW, MAKE THE BUSINESSES COMPLIANT WITH THE FIRE CODE, THE BUILDING DEPARTMENT TAKES A LOOK, TREASURY OBVIOUSLY, THE CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE, AND IT'S A WAY TO HELP BUSINESSES, AND MAKE THEM COMPLIANT AND IT'S -- SO IT'S A GOOD THING AND THE BOULDER CITY COUNCIL DETERMINED THAT -- THAT THERE WERE INEQUITY ISSUES AND SO THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THE MARIJUANA ADVISORY BOARD TAKES A LOOK AT AND OVERSEES AND ADVISES ON. NOT ONLY POLICY, PUT ON THESE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND THEY REALLY WANTED THEIR RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA PENALTY FEES, REQUIREMENTS, TO MIRROR THOSE THAT ARE -- THAT THEY ESTABLISHED FOR LIQUOR LICENSE BUSINESSES. SO LAST QUESTION. AS YOU KNOW, I COMMITTED -- SO I WAS SURPRISED ABOUT THE PARKING. YEAH. DIFFERENT. SO I SUBMITTED QUESTIONS RELATED TO THE OLDER ORDINANCE AS YOU KNOW -- THE BOULDER ORDINANCE AND I GUESS THOSE QUESTIONS WILL BE F FORTHCOMING. BOULDER INCLUDES CHILD CARE CENTERS AND DRUG ADDICTION CENTERS IN THEIR DEFINITION OF SCHOOLS AND THE 1,000-FOOT RULE. WE SAY THE CHILD CARE FACILITIES ARE NOT RELEVANT BECAUSE IT'S YOUNG CHILDREN WHO ARE, QUOTE, NOT INDEPENDENTLY AT RISK, END QUOTE. SO I'M WONDERING IF YOU OR MR. McDONALD COULD EXPLAIN WHAT THAT MEANS AND WHY YOU THINK BOULDER MAY INCLUDE CHILD CARE FACILITIES.
01:15:47.854: >> I CAN'T SPEAK TO WHY THEY INCLUDE CHILD CARE FACILITIES BUT AS A LIVE DISCUSSION THIS EVENING, THE LANGUAGE AND OUR MEDICAL MARIJUANA SEPARATION PROVISIONS, I BELIEVE CAME OUT OF THE CONVENTIONS APPLIED BY THE STATE AS IT RELATES TO LIQUOR LICENSES AS WELL. AND SO THAT'S WHERE WE STARTED AND SORT OF PULLING THAT LANGUAGE FORWARD. AS YOU RECALL, WE DID HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT POTENTIALLY MAKING THOSE CHANGES. THAT WASN'T REALIZED. I THINK THAT --
01:16:18.985: >> Councilmember Lumm: IT WAS BASED ON THE L.A. ORDINANCE. SOME OF THOSE, I THINK YOU WILL RECALL, THEY WERE VERY MEASURABLE IDENTIFIABLE -- IDENTIFIABLE FACILITIES. THERE WAS OTHER LANGUAGE IN THE PROPOSED CHANGE THAT I THINK WAS PROBABLY MORE DIFFICULT TO CATEGORIZE AND DETERMINE. BUT I DON'T -- AGAIN, I DON'T KNOW W WHERE BOULDER'S LANGUAGE CAME FROM, BUT WE STARTED WITH EXACTLY HOW LIQUOR LICENSES ARE CONSIDERED IN THE CONTEXT OF SCHOOLS.
01:16:51.384: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER, NELSON, HAYNER AND GRAND.
01:16:54.721: >> Councilmember Lumm: I HAD ANOTHER QUESTION. YES, I COPIED YOU ON ALL THE OTHER QUESTIONS. IT WAS ONE FEE QUESTION, SINCE YOU ARE STANDING HERE. SO BOULDER CHARGES PERMIT -- CHARGES FEES BEYOND PERMIT FEES. AND RELATED TO CLEANUP AND INSPECTION OF MARIJUANA FACILITIES. DO WE HAVE ANY PLANS TO ADOPT PLANS I DON'T KNOW PERMIT FEES FOR ADDITIONAL COSTS THAT THE CITY MAY INCUR?
01:17:24.050: >> City Admin. Lazarus: WE DO HAVE FIRE INSPECTION FEES. SO THAT COVERS THE COST OF THE FIRE DEPARTMENT.
01:17:28.621: >> Councilmember Lumm: WHERE IS THAT IN THE PROPOSED ORDINANCE? IT'S LAID OUT IN BOULDERS BUT NOT OURS.
01:17:34.393: >> City Admin. Lazarus: IT'S A COMMERCIAL ESTABLISHMENT. WE INSPECT COMMERCIAL ESTABLISHMENT.
01:17:38.464: >> Councilmember Lumm: BUT IT'S NOT LAID OUT IN THIS ORDINANCE.
01:17:40.233: >> JUST A COUPLE OF PROVISIONS IN REGARDS TO THAT. NO -- THE MEDICAL MARIJUANA U.D.C. AND AS IT RELATES TO THE CHAPTER 96, ANY METHODS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO THE CITY FOR ENFORCEMENT OF ANY CODES WOULD APPLY TO MARIJUANA USES AS ANY OTHER USE IN THE CITY. SO IN THE CASE OF FIRE CODE INSPECTION, ANY PROVISIONS FOR FEES FOR ANY ROUTINE INSPECTIONS OF THE FACILITY, OR IF AS A FIRE SUPPRESSION CERTIFICATION, THAT WOULD BE -- LIKEWISE WHEN WE ISSUE ANY BUILDING PERMITS OR CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY, THOSE WOULD BE INTRODUCED IN THAT, AS IT RELATES TO THE ACTUAL PETITION FEE, BOTH LAWS ACTUALLY CREATE SOME CAPS BY WHICH WE CAN'T CHARGE ANY MORE FOR THE APPLICATION FEE AT THE MUNICIPAL LEVEL. I THINK IT'S $5,000 IN BOTH ACTS IF I RECALL. SO I GUESS THE ONLY PIECE THAT I --
01:18:42.295: >> Councilmember Lumm: THERE WAS A LICENSING FEE. THAT WAS THE LICENSING FEE.
01:18:46.299: >> City Admin. Lazarus: RIGHT.
01:18:46.933: >> CORRECT. AND THAT'S GOING TO BE ON TOP OF ANY NORMAL CONDUCTING BUSINESS AND DEVELOPMENT FEES. SEPARATE FROM THAT. SO, FOR EXAMPLE, THE BUILDING PERMIT FEE IS NOT IN THAT $5,000. THAT'S AN ADDITIONAL FEE THAT WE WOULD APPLY A CHARGE TO ANY BUILDING MER MITT. --ER MITT.
01:19:08.788: >> City Admin. Lazarus: SO THEY WON'T GET A CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY, UNLESS THEIR PLAN IS REVIEWED AND CONSTRUCTION IS INSPECTED. THOSE ARE ALL COVERED BY THE BUILDING CODE.
01:19:17.263: >> YES. NOT SPECIFICALLY BY THE MARIJUANA ORDINANCE.
01:19:26.873: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
01:19:28.107: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I HAVE BEEN SCRIBBLING ON MY PAD ALL OF THESE NUMBERS FLYING AROUND AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW THEY ADD UP TO MAKE THE BIGGEST NUMBERS. SOMEBODY NEEDS TO EXPLAIN TO ME. SO IN OUR RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS, THERE'S -- ACTUALLY, LET ME BACK UP. A COUPLE OF PEOPLE HAVE COMMUNICATED WITH COUNCIL THAT THERE ARE THESE PERMITS ISSUED TO SPECULATORS OR PEOPLE HAVE GOTTEN PERMITS AND THEY ARE NOT MAKING USE OF THEM, AND WITH 26 OUT AND THE LIMIT OF 28, THERE'S SORT OF THIS -- THIS CHASE AFTER A SCARCITY, RIGHT? AND I'M -- I HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT THIS. SO I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE ADD UP TO 26 IN OUR RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS, THERE ARE 26 PROVISIONING CENTERS THAT HAVE GOTTEN A SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE.
01:20:32.605: >> YES.
01:20:32.872: >> Councilmember Nelson:  BUT THEN IT SAYS 15 --
01:20:36.208: >> 26 HAVE RECEIVED THAT LAND USE OR SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE. THAT IS THE CITY HAS MADE THE DETERMINATION THAT THEIR PROPOSED USE IS APPROPRIATE IN THEIR LOCATION, SUBJECT TO CONDITIONS OR STANDARDS. THEY HAVE TO TAKE THAT AS WELL AS COMPLIANCE WITH THE BUILDING AND FIRE CODE TO APPLY THEM TO THE CLERK'S OFFICE UNDER CHAPTES ZONING IS UNDER CHAPTER 55 TO SAY, WE WOULD LIKE TO RECEIVE A PERMIT FROM THE CITY TO OPERATE A PROVISIONING CENTER AT THIS LOCATION. THEY PAY A 5,000 FEE TO THE CLERK'S OFFICE, AFTER THEY HAVE ALREADY DEMONSTRATED THAT THEY HAVE THE ZONING AND THE BUILDING CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY. THE CLERK'S OFFICE STARTS PROCESSING THAT APPLICATION. THEN AFTER -- SOMEWHERE BETWEEN MAKING THAT APPLICATION AND FINALIZING AND APPROVING THAT APPLICATION, THE CLERK'S OFFICE IS WAITING FOR AN EXTENSIVE INSPECTION AND VERIFICATION PROCESS TO HAPPEN AT THE STATE LEVEL, AT WHICH POINT THEY RECEIVE THEIR LICENSE FROM THE STATE, WHICH IS THE FINAL BENCHMARK THEN FOR THE CLERK'S OFFICE TO ISSUE THE LOCAL PERMIT UNDER CHAPTER 96. THAT PERMIT IS GOOD FOR A YEAR. THEY HAVE TO COME BACK ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. AND THE CLERK WILL CONTRIBUTE THAT REQUEST TO ALL THE VARIOUS CITY DEPARTMENTS, FIRE, BUILDING, ZONING, POLICE, SOLICITING ANY FEEDBACK ABOUT ANY POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE COMMUNITY EXPERIENCE THAT HAS THAT OVER THE PAST YEAR AND THEN TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT WITH A DETERMINATION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT TO ISSUE A RENEWAL OF THAT. I HOPE I'M ON THE RIGHT FRAME WITH THAT.
01:22:17.510: >> Councilmember Nelson:  THE CLERK IS TAKING THAT ON RIGHT NOW?
01:22:21.213: >> YES, SIMILAR TO LIQUOR LICENSE RENEWALS.
01:22:23.649: >> City Admin. Lazarus: THE COUNCIL HAS LIMITED THE NUMBER OF PERMITS, NOT THE NUMBER OF S.E.U.s THAT ARE GIVEN. IN ORDER TO GET THROUGH THAT PROCESS, WITHOUT ASSURANCE THAT YOU ARE GOING TO GET A PERMIT, YOU STILL HAVE TO GET THE USE APPROVED THROUGH THE PLANNING COMMISSION. SO THERE IS -- WE WILL WHETHER IT'S THE INTENDED USE WE WILL HAVE MORE APPROVED USES THAN PERMITS.
01:22:48.374: >> I WOULD -- LOOK AT IT AS THAT SENSE OF PROSPECTING ON THESE IS TWO THINGS. WHEN THERE WAS A CAP ON THE PROVISIONING CENTERS AND THEY HAVE TO BE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE PERMITS THAT REALLY CREATED THAT CIRCUMSTANCE BECAUSE BY -- BY LAW, AND JUDICIAL PRECEDENCE, SPECIAL EXCEPTION USES RUN WITH THE LAP. THEY DON'T RUN WITH THE TENANT. AND SO WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES IS THE TENANT HAS WORKED WITH A LANDLORD, SOUGHT APPROVAL TO APPLY FOR A SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE, RECEIVED THAT, AND THEN SOMETHING HAPPENED IN THAT RELATIONSHIP WHERE IT NOW THE PROPERTY UNDER LAW HAS THE BENEFIT OF THAT PERMIT, NOT NECESSARILY THE TENANT, AND EVEN THOUGH IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES TO BE CLEAR THE TENANT DID THE HEAVY LIFTING TO GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS AND MAYBE PAY FOR THE DESIGN APPLICATION, ET CETERA. SO THAT'S PROBABLY WHAT YOU ARE HEARING ABOUT IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES POTENTIALLY.
01:23:52.204: >> Councilmember Nelson:  BUT WHEN WE -- THE CHANGES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ADOPTING, IT'S NOT -- NOT EVERY -- NOT EVERY LOCATION IS GOING TO BE A SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE ANYMORE, IS IT?
01:24:03.015: >> ALL PROVISIONING CENTERS AND RETAILERS ARE. MICROBUSINESSES ARE. SOME OF THE OTHER USES DEPENDING ON THE ZONING DISTRICT WHERE THEY ARE LOCATED ARE EITHER MER MITTED OR SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE.
01:24:16.228: >> Councilmember Nelson: OKAY. IT ANSWERS MY QUESTION. I WAS TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF THIS PERCEPTION THAT WE -- THAT PEOPLE ARE FIGHTING OVER TWO REMAINING OPPORTUNITIES TO HAVE -- OKAY. I GET IT. THANKS.
01:24:27.573: >> WELL, YEAH, BUT TO BE CLEAR, WE HAVE OF -- AS A CITY, WE NOW BASED ON OUR DECISION, MAPPED OUT 26 PHYSICAL LOCATIONS WHERE PROVISIONING CENTERS MAY BE LOCATED. THAT'S UNDER CONDITIONS. THOSE HAVE TO BE REALIZED WITHIN A CERTAIN TIME FRAME. THEY HAVE TO RECEIVE CITY PERMIT AND A STATE LICENSE. AND -- BUT THAT COULD HAPPEN BY TENANT A OR A SUBSTITUTE TENANT, AS LONG AS IT HAPPENS WITHIN THAT TIME FRAME, IN THE CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE THOSE CONDITIONS ARE NOT MET WITHIN A REQUIRED TIME FRAME, ESSENTIALLY THAT WILL OPEN UP THE OPPORTUNITY FOR MAYBE A NEW LOCATION.
01:25:04.410: >> I A
01:25:06.278: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I ACTUALLY HAVE A FOLLOW-UP QUESTION. IF IT'S JUST A MATTER OF DEFINING THE LAND USE, LIKE I APOTENTIAL USE, WE COULD THEORETICALLY MAKE -- IT MAKES -- HAVE A SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE FOR A THOUSAND -- WELL, I MEAN, WE WOULDN'T BUT LIKE -- IF THE LIMIT IS ON THE PERMITS, THEN THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE, IF NO ONE IS FOLLOWING THROUGH WITH GETTING A PERMIT, AM I -- DOES THAT MAKE SENSE? IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER HOW MANY -- HOW MANY PIECES OF LAND WE ALLOW THE USE AT, IF IT'S LIMITED BY THE NUMBER OF PERMITS. THAT NUMBER OF 26 IS NOT MEANINGFUL AS THE NUMBER 15 OF THE ACTUAL PERMITS?
01:25:48.287: >> IT'S AN INTERESTING QUESTION. UNDER THE MEDICAL FACILITIES ACT, THERE WASN'T THE SAME REQUIREMENT OF A COMPETITIVE PROCESS. IT WAS MORE HOW DID THE CITY BELIEVE THAT IT WAS EQUITABLE AND FAIR TO DETERMINE WHERE THOSE 28 PERMITS MIGHT -- HOW -- IN WHAT ORDER MIGHT THEY BE CONSIDERED. SO I THINK YOUR QUESTION IS A GOOD ONE. YOU COULD APPROACH IT THAT WAY. THUS FAR, WE HAVE BEEN VERY CAREFUL FROM A STAFF PERSPECTIVE, NOT TO SET UP THE EXPECTATION OF RECEIVING A SPECIAL EXPECTATION -- A SPECIAL EXCEPTION PERMIT WITHOUT THE --
01:26:22.154: >> Councilmember Nelson:  THE LIKELIHOOD.
01:26:24.690: >> THE LIKELIHOOD OF A PERMIT EVER BEING GRANTED. IT IS CONCEIVABLE THAT YOU COULD -- WE COULD SHIFT THAT EXPECTATION AND RELY ON THE COMPETITIVE PROCESS, BUT TO BE CLEAR, WE ARE GOING THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION WITH THE PROPOSED CHANGES. IT SPECIFICALLY SAYS WE WILL NOT ISSUE MORE LAND USE PERMITS THAN WILL BE PERMITTED UNDER CHAPTER 96.
01:26:46.612: >> Councilmember Nelson:  OH, AS A POLICY --
01:26:49.081: >> IT'S PROPOSED IN THE CODE AT THIS POINT AS PART OF THE AMENDMENTS.
01:26:52.251: >> Councilmember Nelson: OKAY. THANK YOU. THAT'S HELPFUL.
01:26:55.921: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
01:26:56.789: >> Councilmember Hayner:  SO THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE PERMITS THEY APPLY TO THE MICROBUSINESSES?
01:27:00.993: >> YES.
01:27:01.260: >> Councilmember Hayner:  AND THE CONSUMPTION CENTERS NO? WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE THAT? THAT WAS AN ERROR, RIGHT?
01:27:10.102: >> NO, CONSUMPTION -- NO, DESIGNATED CONSUMPTION ERRORS SHOULD BE IN THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE. THEY WERE LISTED IN THE PERMITTED USE TABLE CORRECTLY.
01:27:19.712: >> Councilmember Hayner:  ALL RIGHT.
01:27:22.147: >> AND MICROBUSINESSES -- LET ME JUST DOUBLE CHECK THAT.
01:27:24.249: >> Councilmember Hayner:  SO THE USE OF THOSE ARE DEFINED BY STATE LAW, RIGHT? SO THAT TYPE OF BUSINESS IS DEFINED BY STATE LAW. SO A CONSUMPTION CENTER HAS TO HAVE CERTAIN PROPERTIES AND A MICROBUSINESS HAS CERTAIN PROPERTIES AND 1LANTS, THAT'S -- THAT'S NEW MICRO, I GUESS. SO I JUST HAD A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THE STATE LAW, AS IT REGARDS TO THESE TWO TYPES OF FACILITIES. IS THERE A -- IN A CONSUMPTION CENTER, YOU CONDITION PURCHASE, BUT YOU COULD -- YOU CAN'T PURCHASE, BUT COULD YOU HAVE A SEPARATE ACCESS, SEPARATE BOOKKEEPING AND YOU GO ONE PLACE AND GO NEXT DOOR TO CONSUME. IS THERE A MINIMUM OR A MAXIMUM SET AS TO WHAT YOU CAN BRING IN THERE, AND HOW MANY PEOPLE CAN BE IN THERE AND HOW MANY PEOPLE COME IN TOGETHER? THAT KIND OF THING? IS THAT DEFINED IN THE STATE LAW? LIKE, IF I RA I REREAD THE STATE LAWS, I WILL KNOW THESE ANSWERS. THE VOLUMES, IS THAT THE SAME FOR THE MICROBUSINESSOR OTT RETAIL OUTLETS? IS THERE A MINIMUM OR MAXIMUM PURCHASE THAT HAS TO BE MADE? I'M CURIOUS.
01:28:23.776: >> IF YOU GO BACK TO THE LAW, THERE'S A MAXIMUM AMOUNT THAT YOU CAN POSSESS AS AN INDIVIDUAL RECREATIONALLY.
01:28:32.217: >> Councilmember Hayner: RIGHT. SO THAT'S THE MAXIMUM WALKING OUT --
01:28:36.088: >> THE MAXIMUM ON YOUR PERSON.
01:28:37.556: >> Councilmember Hayner:  AND WALKING INTO A CONSUMPTION CENTER --
01:28:40.692: >> IF YOU EXCEEDED THAT LEVEL, YOU WOULD BE IN VIOLATION OF THE LAW BY HAVING TOO MUCH.
01:28:46.698: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WILL TRY TO BE BRIEF. WE TALK ABOUT THESE CAPS AND IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT IF WE HAD NO CAPS THEN THERE WOULD BE NO NEED FOR THIS EQUITY PERMIT APPLICATION; IS THAT CORRECT?
01:28:59.511: >> THAT'S CORRECT.
01:29:00.012: >> Councilmember Hayner:  SO WE ARE KIND OF CREATING WORK FOR OURSELVES AND THE WHOLE PROCESS BY SETTING THESE CAPS IN PLACE. OKAY. SO JUST ONE LAST COMMENT. SO I KNOW THAT BUSINESSES -- NO BUSINESS LIKES TO OPERATE IN A REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT THAT'S A CONSTANTLY MOVING TARGET. YOU DON'T WANT TO SET UP SOMETHING, MAKE AN INVESTMENT, GO THROUGH ALL OF THESE HOOPS, TO FIND OUT THAT LATER ON, COUNCIL BODY IS GOING TO MAKE IT MORE OR LESS PERMISSIVE FOR YOU TO OPERATE UNDER THESE RULES. AND SO I -- I KNOW THAT EVERY DAY THAT REC MARIJUANA IS NOT BEING SOLD IN THESE ENVIRONMENTS, AS A MONEY LOSS TO THESE PEOPLE WHO HAVE INVESTED IN THIS BUT AT THE SAME TIME, IT SEEMS LIKE I JUST -- YOU KNOW, I'M FULLY SUPPORTIVE OF, YOU KNOW, LETTING THESE THINGS HAPPEN IN THE PROPER WAY AND I HATE THE IDEA OF GIVING BUSINESSES A MOVING TARGET AND SAY, WE ARE GOING TO COME BACK AND BE MORE OR LESS PERMISSIVE LATER ON, WE ARE NOT SURE, ESPECIALLY IF ARE THE TARGETS OF LAWSUITS, UNLIKE 800 OR 1,000 CITIES BY NOVEMBER 1st ROLLS AROUND. I WOULD LIKE TO THINK OF SUPPORTING A TEMPORARY OPT OUT, BUT I HOPE THAT THE CALENDAR OF SEPTEMBER, GIVING US THIS EXTRA WEEK IN BETWEEN WILL DO THAT FOR US. I HOPE THAT WE CAN COME TOGETHER ON THIS AND GET ALL THE THINGS THAT WE FEEL THAT WE NEED TO BE PRODUCTIVE OF THE COMMUNITY. IF YOU READ THE PREAMBLE TO BOULDER'S LAW. THERE'S TWO THINGS THAT WE DON'T TALK ABOUT, AND ONE IS THEY RECOGNIZE THAT -- THAT IS STILL ALL UNLAWFUL UNDER FEDERAL LAW, AND I WONDER IF WE SHOULDN'T MAKE THAT A SAME KIND OF STATEMENT THAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT TO PROTECT OURSELVES IN THE FUTURE AND THEY ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THEIR LAW IS WRITTEN TO BE PROTECTIVE OF THE COMMUNITY AT LAW -- IT'S FOR THE COMMUNITY'S BENEFIT, NOT FOR THESE BUSINESSES BENEFITS. I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING ELSE I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IN OUR PREAMBLES. THANK YOU.
01:31:03.001: >> Mayor Taylor: I HAVE GRAND AND BANNISTER AND PERHAPS -- I THINK WE HAVE PROBABLY RUN UP TO OUR TIME. COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
01:31:10.809: >> Councilmember Grand: I THINK COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN ANSWERED THIS QUESTION BUT IT'S SOMETHING I WANT TO STATE PUBLICKY. IF YOU HAVE A SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE AND YOU DON'T GET A PERMIT WITHIN THREE YEARS THAT SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE DISAPPEARS?
01:31:22.721: >> CORRECT.
01:31:23.055: >> Councilmember Grand: SO THAT IS A WAY WE CAN PROVIDE AN OPENING FOR ADDITIONAL PERMITS IF THAT'S NOT REALIZED. OKAY. SO I THINK THAT MAYBE HELPS STRUCTURE THE NUMBERSCONVERSATI. JUST TO COMMENT MORE THAN ANYTHING. I JUST WANTED TO SPEAK TO THESE PARKING MAXIMUMS. I THINK THIS COULD BE REASONABLE TO ASSUME THAT AT A CONSUMPTION CENTER, THAT THERE WOULD BE EMPLOYEES THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO PROVIDE PARKING FOR OTHERWISE, THOSE THAT ARE CONSUMING ARE NOT REALLY -- ARE NOT REALLY KEEN TO BE PROVIDING PARK POR FOR THOSE FOLKS. I KNOW THE EDUCATION AND THE WATCHFULNESS THAT WILL OCCUR IN THESE CONSUMPTION CENTERS ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT FOLKS ARE NOT OVER CONSUMING, PARTICULARLY IF IT'S THEIR FIRST TIME IN SUCH A FACILITY, BUT, YOU KNOW -- I WOULD BE ALL IN FAVOR OF US MOVING THAT WAY WITH BARS AS WELL.
01:32:18.143: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
01:32:19.044: >> Councilmember Bannister:  I HAD SOME FOLLOW-ON QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS 600 FEEL AND THE CAPS. YOU KNOW, IF WE HAVE A LOCATION THAT HAS THEIR S.E.U., AND THEY HAVE GONE DORMANT BUT THEIR THREE YEARS IS NOT UP. SO THEY ARE HOLDING THAT 600 FEET BUT THERE'S ANOTHER GUY -- ANOTHER BUSINESS JUST 10W THEY COULD POSSIBLY GET OUT OF LUCK IF ANOTHER BUSINESS THAT'S 600 FEET AWAY FROM THE FIRST BUSINESS, AN INTERLOPER BUT NOT AWAY FROM THE SECOND BUSINESS, HE COULD BE STUCK IN A BAD SITUATION, WHERE HE WOULD BE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST SO TO SPEAK. HOW -- BECAUSE OF THE 600 FEET OR MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE OF THE CAPS, IS THERE A WAY TO HANDLE THAT?
01:33:08.827: >> SO THAT'S HOW WE -- WE FACE THAT EXACT PROBLEM OR CIRCUMSTANCE WITH MEDICAL MARIJUANA PROVISIONING CENTERS AND THAT'S WHERE I WAS REFERENCING, IT WASN'T DICTATED BY THE STATE LAW, BUT RATHER OUR LEGISLATIVE CONSCIENCE ON WHAT WAS A FAIR AND EQUITABLE WAY TO DEAL WITH THAT CIRCUMSTANCE AND THE WAY WE DID THAT IS WE SET UP AN OPENING TIME AT WHICH POINT WE WOULD START ACCEPTING APPLICATIONS AND WE CONSIDERED THEM IN ORDER. WE WERE VERY DELIBERATE WHERE WE WOULD GO THROUGH APPLICATIONS TO MAKE SURE WE HAD THE MATERIALS AND THEN WE WOULD START REVIEW WITH THEM AND IF THAT CIRCUMSTANCE PRESENTED ITSELF, WE WOULD HOLD AN APPLICATION IN SORT OF QUEUE UNTIL A RESOLUTION OCCURRED ON ANOTHER DETERMINATIVE APPLICATION. I THINK THE OPPORTUNITY EXISTS IN TERMS OF RECREATIONAL TO REFIND SOME OF THAT THROUGH A COMPETITIVE SCORING, THE LOCATION AT THE CATEGORY AS ATTORNEY McDONALD HAD INDICATED, BUT IN SHORT, WE -- WE HAD TO DEAL WITH THAT EXACT CIRCUMSTANCES AND THAT'S HOW WE DID IT WITH MEDICAL. AS INDICATED, WE WOULD PROBABLY PROVIDE A MORE SPECIFIC SCORING COMPETITIVE PROCESS FOR FUTURE APPLICATIONS FOR RETAIL. AND TO BE CLEAR, WITH THE INCLUSION OF A CAP, THE COMPETITIVE REQUIREMENT IS SPECIFICALLY FOR RECREATIONAL USES NOT FOR MEDICAL FACILITIES.
01:34:42.320: >> Councilmember Bannister: OKAY. AND ANOTHER PROBLEM ALONG SORT OF IN THAT SAME WAY THAT COULD BE A PROBLEM LATER, SO IF THE STATE EXPUNGES RECORDS OF PEOPLE WHO WERE PREVIOUSLY IN PRISON FOR SELLING MARIJUANA, AND YELTSIN WE HAVE ALREADY CAPPED -- AN ANN ARBOR IS ALREADY IN BUSINESS AND WE ARE CAPPED AND WE ARE FILLED UP, THOSE PEOPLE THAT ARE NOW EXPUNGED AND ELIGIBLE, THAT WE ARE TRYING TO NOT BE DISCRIMINATING AGAINST, THAT, I GUESS, WOULD BE ADDRESSED WITH AN ORDINANCE CHANGE IN THE FUTURE?
01:35:23.528: >> I PUT IT IN TWO AREAS. ONE ADDRESS IT IN THE COMPETITIVE SCORING. FIND WAYS YOU WANT TO PROVIDE A MORE COMPETITIVE RESULT FOR APPLICATIONS THAT WERE COMING OUT OF THAT CIRCUMSTANCE. AND THEN I WOULD SAY THE STATE -- THIS IS AN IMPERFECT ANSWER. THE STATE IS ALSO ACTIVELY TRYING TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE THAT HAVE BEEN MORE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY THOSE KIND OF CIRCUMSTANCES. SO THEY ARE ACTUALLY ACTIVELY PUTTING UP TRAINING SESSIONS TO HELP TO ULTIMATE ELEVATOR NEW BUSINESSES IN THOSE COMMUNITIES. NAANN ARBOR IS NOT ONE OF THOSE COMMUNITIES AND I WOULD SAY THE BENEFIT IS HAPPENING ON A STATEWIDE LEVEL TO SOME EXTENT. IF WE WANTED TO INCORPORATE IT INTO THE CITY, IT WOULD PROBABLY BE THROUGH SOME SORT OF SCORING METRIC.
01:36:15.714: >> AND IF I COULD ADD TO, THAT IT'S CERTAINLY WITHIN THE COUNCIL ACE DISCRETION AT SOME LATER TIME TO MAKE A DECISION THAT MORE FACILITIES ARE NEEDED FOR THE COMMUNITY IN WHICH YOU WOULD JUST RAISE THE CAP AT THAT TIME.
01:36:31.730: >> Councilmember Bannister: OKAY. AND MAYBE YOU CAN EXPLAIN THE LOGIC ON THIS. IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE A PARTY STORE THAT'S ALREADY SELLING LIQUOR WOULD BE A NATURAL FIT TO ALSO SELL MARIJUANA TOO, BUT WHAT'S THE LOGIC OR -- BETWEEN THAT BEING EXCLUDED THAT WAY?
01:36:57.222: >> I THINK STATE LAW PROVIDES SOME RESTRICTIONS ON ANY BUSINESS SELLING LIQUOR AND MARIJUANA. SO TO THAT POINT OF REALLY SETTING STATE REQUIREMENTS SO THAT THE OPERATIONS ARE DISTINCT AND CAN BE TRACKED IN A VERY SPECIFIC BASIS, THE STATE PROVISIONS WOULD RESTRAIN THAT. ALL THE PEOPLE BEHIND THIS KNOW ME MORE THAN I DO. BUT THERE'S POTENTIALLY SOME CHALLENGES ON THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION TO INTEGRATE THOSE USES TOO MUCH UNTIL THE BANKING INDUSTRY CATCHES UP SATISFACTORY TO THE MARIJUANA MARKET.
01:37:36.895: >> Councilmember Bannister: OKAY. YEAH. THAT'S -- THAT'S -- SO THERE'S NO LITTLE WORK AROUND WHERE WE WOULD LET THEM BE SEPARATE BUT STILL ON THE SAME PREMISES?
01:37:45.737: >> SO PROPOSING SIMILAR DISTRICTS, COMMERCIAL DISTRICTS WHERE THAT SORT OF RETAIL EXCHANGE OF GOODS WOULD APRIL, BUT PROBABLY -- WOULD HAPPEN, BUT PROBABLY DISTINCT USES.
01:37:56.147: >> Councilmember Bannister: OKAY. SO JUST IN CLOSING, I WANTED TO PIGGYBACK ON COUNCILMEMBER'S GRISWOLD'S COMMENTS, THAT THE MARIJUANA MAY CONTRIBUTE TO THE OPIOID CRISIS. THERE WAS A CONFERENCE HERE IN TOWN ABOUT PSYCHOLOGISTS AND SOCIAL WORKERS USING SOME NEW GUIDED THERAPY SESSIONS THAT WAS APPARENTLY A VERY INSPIRING AND EXCITING CONFERENCE. AND HAD A LOT OF PROMISE TO MENTAL HEALTH.
01:38:40.959: >> Mayor Taylor: THANKS. THANK YOU FOR THE WORK TO GET US TO THIS POINT. IT IS A FAST-MOVING AND COMPLEX AND, YOU KNOW, OPAQUE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE OPERATE AND I KNOW STAFF RESPONDED TO MANY OF OUR CONCERNS THAT WE DO GET SOMETHING ON THE TABLE TO DISCUSS, AND THEY DID SO AND I'M GRATEFUL FOR IT. TO THANK YOU. WE NOW COME TO PUBLIC COMMENT GENERAL TIME. PUBLIC COMMENT GENERAL TIME IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO SPEAK TO COUNCIL AND THE COMMUNITY ABOUT MATTERS OF MUNICIPAL INTEREST. TO SPEAK AT GENERAL COMMENT GENERAL TIME, YOU HAVE THREE MINUTE TO SPEAK. PLEASE PAY ATTENTION TO THE TIME CLOCK. WE MAY HAVE ONLY ONE PERSON SPEAKING AT A TIME AND FINALLY, IF YOU REQUIRE ASSISTANCE IN SPEAKING BEFORE COUNCIL TODAY, WE WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO PROVIDE IT TO YOU. IS THERE ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT? JUST PLEASE JUST WALK ON UP. YOU DON'T NEED TO BE RECOGNIZED.
01:39:35.814: >> GOOD EVENI MR. MAYOR AND CITY COUNCILMEMBERS, MY NAME IS HUGO J. MACK, AND I'M A CANDIDATE FOR THE PROSECUTOR IN 2020. I'M HERE BECAUSE I'M TOUCHED BY WHAT COUNC COUNCILWOMAN GRESS WD ABOUT THE POSITIVE EFFECTS OF WHAT IT CAN BENEFIT US IN, PEOPLE THAT ARE IN TREMENDOUS PAIN, AS OPPOSED TO RESORTING TO MORPHINE AND I'M UNDERSTANDING OF THAT, BUT THE NEXT WASHTENAW COUNTY PROSECUTING ATTORNEY WILL BE THE CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT ATTORNEY, AND THAT MEANS I WILL HAVE TO ENFORCE LAWS IF THE VOTERS DECIDE THAT TO BE ME, AND WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT IS AS WE PROGRESS THE FULFILLMENT OF THE VOTER'S DECISION LAST NOVEMBER, ARE WE GOING TO LOOK AT PUBLIC EDUCATION, FOR EXAMPLE? THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE, AND PRACTICING ATTORNEY, WHO THINK BECAUSE I HAVE A MEDICAL MARIJUANA CARD, IT'S OKAY FOR THEM TO SMOKE MARIJUANA AND DRIVE A VEHICLE, REGARDLESS OF THE MATTER OF THC IN THEIR SYSTEM. THAT'S FALSE. THERE ARE SOME WHO DON'T SEE THAT MARIJUANA IS STILL A SCHEDULE ONE OFFENSE, ALONG WITH LSD. NOT EVERYONE KNOWS THIS. NOT ONLY IN LOOKING AT THE -- PRIMARILY AS THE MINISTER OF JUSTICE, RESPONSIBLE FOR JUSTICE FOR THE 325,000 RESIDENTS OF THIS COUNTY, INCLUDING ALL OF YOU AND YOUR FAMILIES. SO WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT IS, JUST AS IN ANY OTHER SUB STANCE, THERE CAN BE ABUSE. WE HAVE OVER 3,000 STATUTES NOW IN TERMS OF CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES AND I'M CONCERNED IF WE ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGING IN PUBLIC EDUCATION TO LET PEOPLE KNOW YOU CAN'T JUST GO IN AND CONSUME AND THINK THAT YOU CAN BE DISORDERLY ON STREETS AND PASS THAT OFF ON A MEDICAL MARIJUANA CARD OR PUBLIC CONSUMPTION, FOR RECREATIONAL USE. NOW THE CONCERN I HAVE IS, IS THAT, FOR EXAMPLE, AS I BELIEVE COUNCIL WOMAN GRISWOLD STATED, IN TERMS OF THE USE OF IT, IN TERMS OF PEOPLE THAT ARE INCARCERATED NOW FOR SOMETHING WHICH IS NOW BEING LEGAL, I AM CONCERNED ABOUT INDIVIDUALS HAVING OPPORTUNITIES TO REENTER INTO RESTORATIVE JUSTICE. I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THAT, BUT I'M ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THE PUBLIC EDUCATION PIECE BECAUSE I REALLY DON'T WANT CITIZENS TO BE MISLED INTO THINKING THAT IT'S JUST AN OPEN AREA, IT'S AN OPEN FIELD, IT'S AN OPEN OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE I WILL ENFORCE THE LAW. AND SO I'M ASKING AND I'M REACHING OUT TO CITY COUNCIL TO BE SURE THAT WE HAVE PUBLIC EDUCATION IN THIS ALSO. I MEAN THERE IS AN OFFENSE TO DRIVE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF DRUGS. I'M ASKING FOR HELP FOR WHOEVER THE NEXT COUNTY PROSECUTOR WILL BE. HOPEFULLY IT'S ME. BUT WE NEED TO EDUCATE THE CITIZENS. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
01:42:41.132: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT?
01:42:52.543: >> GOOD EVENING, BRIAN FENICK, I APPRECIATE THE TIME TO SPEAK THIS EVENING AND THE SPECIAL WORKING SESSION THIS EVENING AS WELL. IT'S OBVIOUSLY AN IMPORTANT TOPIC. IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE CITY AS A WHOLE BECAUSE IF WE ARE TRULY GOING TO HAVE A REGULATED MARKET IN THIS TOWN, WE NEED TO FLESH OUT SOME OF THESE ISSUES NOT SO MUCH THE OPTING IN OR OUT POINT. I THINK THAT IS SOMEWHAT CLEAR AT THIS POINT, BUT TO ECHO SOME OF WHAT COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI HAS STATED, I THINK THERE'S SOME ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL EQUITY ISSUES THAT THE COMPANY KIND OF HAS AN IMPACT ON. AND IF WE ARE GOING TO SILT AND HAVE -- A SIT AND HAVE A NUMBERF 28 -- WHICH I BELIEVE WAS SET AT 28, PRIMARILY BECAUSE THAT'S THE NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS THAT WERE AT THE TIME THE AMENDMENT TO THE ORIGINAL ORDINANCE WAS PASSED. SO THAT'S REALLY WHY IT WAS AT 28 AT THE TIME, BUT IF WE ARE GOING TO -- IF WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A TRUE ROBUST MARKET IN THIS TOWN, REGULATED MARK IN THIS TOWN, THEN WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT OPENING UP SOME OF THOSE CAPS, ESPECIALLY IF WE ARE GOING TO SAY THAT YOU CAN HAVE COMBINED CONSUMPTION AND THE CONSUMPTION FACILITIES AND THE MICROBUSINESSES AT 28, AS WELL, IF YOU ONLY HAVE 28 BUSINESSES THAT ARE GOING TO HAVE PERMITS, PROVISIONING CENTERS, THEN IT'S REALISTIC TO THINK THAT THOSE ARE THE ONLY NUMBERS THAT ARE GOING -- THOSE ARE THE ONLY PERMITS THAT ARE GOING TO APPLY FOR THE CONSUMPTION -- THE COMBINED CONSUMPTION FACILITIES. SO IN OTHER WORDS, THERE'S REALLY -- YOU ARE REALLY NOT OPENING UP MUCH OF ANYTHING, THIS TERMS OF THE PROVISIONING CENTER COMBINED WITH A -- A CONSUMPTION FACILITY AND A STAND ALONE CONSUMPTION FACILITY TRULY REALLY -- THEY ARE NOT REALLY THAT VALUABLE FROM AN ECONOMIC STANDPOINT. AND THEN FINALLY, SPEAKING ABOUT S.E.U.s, WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IS THAT THEY HAVE BEEN COMMODITYIZED BY THE CAP. WE HAVE SEEN SOME LOCATIONS WHERE AN S.E.U. HAS BEEN ACQUIRED AND SOLD UP TO TWO TIMES. AND THEY ARE JUST LEASES. THEY DON'T EVEN OWN THAT PROPERTY. SO BY, AGAIN, CREATING THE CAP, YOU ARE CREATING A BIT OF A MONOPOLY FOR THOSE WHO ARE OPERATING RIGHT NOW, AND BY NOT OPENING IT UP, YOU ARE REALLY NOT CREATING A ROBUST REGULATORY MARK. YOU ARE INVITING A MORE ROBUST BLACK MARKET, SO TO SPEAK. AND THEN FINALLY, I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT I BELIEVE AT THE COUNCIL MEETING LAST WEEK, THERE WAS SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT OPENING UP THE COLLOCATION OF PROVISIONING CENTERS AND CONIF A SILLS TO MORE THAN D1 AND D2 AND I BELIEVE THERE WAS AN AMENDMENT THAT WAS PROPOSED AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT AMENDMENT WAS EVER VOTED ON. SO I WOULD LIKE TO JUST REMIND YOU ALL TO MAYBE GO BACK AND LOOK AT THE RECORD AND SEE IF THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS AN AMENDMENT THAT WAS PROPOSED, BUT I DO THINK THAT D1 AND -- IT SHOULD BE OPENED UP BEYOND THAT, AS WELL AS INCREASING THE CAP. THANK YOU.
01:46:01.199: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
01:46:07.972: >> GOOD EVENING. MY NAME IS DIANE GIANOLA AND I LIVE IN THE 4th WARD. I WAS TAKEN BY SURPRISE WHEN THE MARIJUANA CONSUMPTION FACILITIES WERE ADDED TO THE PROPOSED ORDINANCE FOR MARIJUANA RETAIL STORES. THE BALLOT PROPOSAL ASKED FOR LEGALIZATION OF MARIJUANA SALES. NO WHERE WAS IT MENTIONED OR EVEN DISCUSSED THAT CONSUMPTION CENTERS OR USE CENTERS COULD BE OR WOULD BE ESTABLISHED. THESE CONSUMPTION CENTERS ARE A DANGER STUDENT OF ALL OF US ON THE R. EVERY CUSTOMER THAT VISITS A MARIJUANA CONSUMPTION CENTER WILL LEAVE HIGH OR BUZZED AND WILL LIKELY GET INTO A CAR TO DRIVE HOME OR AROUND TOWN. ALL PATRONS WHO LEAVE THESE ESTABLISHMENTS HIGH AND DRIVE ARE A DIRECT SAFETY RISK TO THE REST OF THE RESIDENTS OF THE CITY. MARIJUANA IS NOT LIKE ALCOHOL. IT IS A FALSE EQUIVALENCY THAT ALCOHOL AND MARIJUANA USE ARE THE SAME. THEY ARE NOT. YOU CAN GO TO A BAR OR RESTAURANT AND HAVE ONLY ONE ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE WITH OR WITHOUT A MEAL. YOU DON'T HAVE TO GET DRUNK AND MOST DON'T GET DRUNK AFTER VISITING AN ESTABLISHMENT WITH ALCOHOL. THE PRIMARY PURPOSE IS SIMPLY ENJOY A BEER WITH FRIENDS OR GLASS OF WINE WITH A MEAL, NOT TO GET DRUNK. THE VAST MAJORY IT OF PEOPLE WHO LEAVE BARS DO NOT LEAVE DRUNK OR ARE IMPAIRED DRIVERS. IT IS THE ABUSE OF CON ALCOHOL,T THE USE OF ALCOHOL THAT IS THE PROBLEM IN RELATION TO DRIVING. THE VAST MAJORITY MANUFACTURE OF PEOPLE WHOLEAVE THE MARIJUANN CENTER. THE ONLY PURPOSE IS TO GET HIGH. YOU DON'T GO TO ENJOY THE AROMA OR THE TASTE OF POT BEFORE YOU GET HIGH OR TAKE ONE HIT OFF THE JOINT. YOU DON'T HAVE TO ABUSE MARIJUANA TO GET HIGH AND BECOME AN EMP IMPAIRED DRIVER. THE CITY CAN'T ASSUME THAT THE BALLOT PROPOSAL THAT HE WILLIZEL LEGALIZED -- LEGALIZED THAT EVERYONE WOULD WANT CONSUMPTION CENTERS AROUND TOWN. THE BALLOT MEASURES MENTIONED NOTHING ABOUT CONSUMPTION CENTERS. WHY IS COUNCIL NOW TRYING TO SLIDE THIS THROUGH WHEN THE PUBLIC THINKS YOU ARE SIMPLY TALKING ABOUT REGULATING AND ZONING THE RETAIL SHOPS? I ASK THAT YOU SIMPLY PASS THE REGULATIONS AND ZONING FOR THE RETAIL SHOPS AS EXPECTED AND DISCUSS THE CONSUMPTION CENTERS AT A LATER DATE. THERE ARE SO MANY ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE DISCUSSED. PARKING? THERE SHOULD BE NO PARKING AT THESE FACILITIES SO AS NOT NO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE DRIVING BUZZED. WILL THE CITY BE RESPONSIBLE BECAUSE IT ALLOWED PARKING AT THIS SORT OF PLACE KNOWING FULL WELL OF THE SAFETY RISK. THERE'S NO DRUNK DRIVING TEST THAT CAN BE IMPAIRED ON IMPAIRED DRIVERS. HOW DO YOU PREVENT HOO I DRIVING. I'M APPALLED THIS IS BEING SLIPPED THROUGH WITHOUT COMMUNICATION DISCUSSION. I ASK YOU REMOVE ANY CONTRIBUTION OF MARIJUANA CONSUMPTION CENTERS AND TEMPORARY MARIJUANA. S IN THESE ORDINANCES. BOTH OF THESE ARE RISK TO THE PUBLIC SAFETY IF YOU CAN'T CONTROL IMPAIRED DRIVER BEHAVIOR. THANK YOU.
01:49:11.155: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WOULD WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT (
01:49:21.499: >> MY NAME IS CHARLES REAM. WE KNOW THAT THE STATE COMMISSION ON DRIVING JUST FINISHED UP AND FOUND NO CONNECTION WHATSOEVER WITH THE AMOUNT OF THC AND IMPAIRMENT. IT'S MOSTLY A QUESTION OF PRACTICE OR EXPERIENCE. THE PEOPLE OF ANN ARBOR WERE READY FOR THE SOCIAL CONSUMPTION CENTERS IN 1972. THE PEOPLE OF ANN ARBOR HAVE WETTED 50 YEARS FOR THIS. -- WAITED 50 YEARS FOR THIS. TO SAY THERE IS SOME KIND OF HURRY OR RUSH OR WE NEED A BIT MORE TIME AFTER WE WAITED 50 YEARS IS KIND OF AN INSULT TO A LOT OF US. ALCOHOL IS DEADLY. AND MANY PEOPLE IN MY FAMILY ARE DEAD FROM IT. ONE COUSIN WAS BORN WITH -- RETARDED WITH HAIR GROWING ALL UP HER BACK. PEOPLE DESERVE TO HAVE AS MANY OPTIONS TO USE AND PURCHASE HEALTHY MARIJUANA AS THEY DO TO PURCHASE THE POISONS OF TOBACCO OR ALCOHOL. THERE'S GOT TO BE EQUIVALENTS AND THERE CAN'T BE ANY PREJUDICE AGAINST FOOD. IF YOU PROHIBIT FOOD, YOU ARE JUST ENCOURAGING SORT OF A DRUG EXPERIENCE. IF YOU ALLOW FOOD, YOU ARE ENCOURAGING A COMPLETE CULTURAL EXPERIENCE. ONE THING I FOUND JUST FASCINATING WAS THE CURFEW. A 9:00 CURFEW. HERE IN MY LIFE, I HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO GO OUT AND SOCIALIZE. I CAN'T DRINK ALCOHOL. I SIMPLY CANNOT DO IT. AND I CAN'T GET NEAR CIGARETTES AT ALL BECAUSE THEY MAKE ME REALLY SICK. SO I HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO GO OUTOUT AND SOCIALIZE. NOW I WILL BE ABLE TO GO OUT AND SOCIALIZE AND I WILL HAVE TO BE HOME BY 9:00. IN EAST LANSING, IT'S 10:00. LOTS OF AMERICANS EVEN AREN'T DONE WITH DINNER UNTIL 10:00. AT LEAST WE COULD MAKE IT A MIDNIGHT CURFEW OR SOMETHING. IT SHOULD BE THE SAME WAY AS ALCOHOL. NOT 9:00, COME ON, BOYS AND GIRLS. AND WE KNOW THE POLICE AND THE FIRE REPORTS. YOU HAVE ALL BEEN HERE WITH THE POLICE AND THE FIRE REPORTS, THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE FIRE DEPARTMENT ALWAYS SAY THESE ESTABLISHMENTS ARE JUST FINE AND NOT CAUSING ANY DIFFICULTY WHATSOEVER. YOU SHOULD REALLY THINK ABOUT THIS 10% ENERGY OFFSET. THAT TAKES A LOT OF ENERGY TO GROW, CANNABIS. THEY ARE NEVER GOING TO BE ABLE -- I DON'T THINK JUST BY PUTTING SOLAR PANELS ON THE ROOF YOU ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET 10% OF YOUR ENERGY USE. THIS IS PROBABLY PROHIBIT ANY GROWERS FROM LOCATING HERE BECAUSE THEIR COSTS WILL BE SO MUCH HIGHER. AND MAYBE YOU KNOW THE DATA ALREADY ABOUT MARIJUANA ESTABLISHMENTS, CRIME GOES DOWN ANYWHERE NEAR MARIJUANA ESTABLISHMENTS BECAUSE THERE'S USUALLY A LOT OF SECURITY. PROPERTY VALUES GO UP NEAR ANY MARIJUANA ESTABLISHMENTS. WE DON'T NEED ANY PROBLEMS WITH PROXIMITY TOO. WE NEED TO LET THESE THINGS EXIST. THE ANN ARBOR VOTERS WANT THEM AND WANT THEM NOW. THANKS.
01:52:21.812: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
01:52:28.352: >> HELLO, GOOD EVENING. MY NAME IS KEVIN BROWN WITH MEDICINE MAN OF ANN ARBOR. WE ARE GRANDFATHERED IN AS A TEMPORARY OPERATOR OF ANN ARBOR. WE ARE A COMPASSION-DRIVEN BUSINESS AND LOVE OPERATING IN ANN ARBOR. MY FATHER AND I BOTH ATTENDED THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AND FELL IN LOVE WITH ANN ARBOR. WE HAVE BEEN SELECTED AS A BUSINESS REP FOR THE STATE OF MICHIGAN SOCIAL EQUITY PROGRAM. THE DILEMMA WE FACE IS THE UNWRITTEN RULE OF S.E.U. CAP OF 28. THE CAP OF 28 DISPENSARIES WAS VERY CLEAR IN THE ORDINANCE, HOWEVER THE S.E.U. CAP IS UNWRITTEN AND IT GREATLY ARMED US ON OUR A -- HARMED US IN OUR MOVING OF OUR BUSINESS. OUR APPROACH WAS TOWARDS TAKING ONE OF THE 28 PERMITS IN THE LOVER LICENSE. WE WERE UNABLE TO MOVE TO THE NEW GREEN ZONE LOCATION BECAUSE THE PLANNERS DECIDED THE CAP OF THE S.E.U. AT 28 AS WELL. THIS KURT BU HURT BUSINESSES SUS HOURS. BY CAPPING THE S.E.U.s YOU ESSENTIALLY ATTACHED A CITY DISPENSARY TO THE LOCATION AND NOT THE BUSINESS. THIS PUSHES CORPORATE GREED IN AND PUSHES YOUR COMPASSION FOR THE BUSINESSES OUT BY NOT ALLOWING A BUSINESS SUCH AS OURS TO MOVE, AND KEEP OUR CURRENT ACTIVE PERMIT. WE ASK THAT THIS IS CORRECTED BY NOT GAPPING THE S.E. U.s OR TO AT LEAST ALLOW A BUSINESS WITH A STATE LICENSE WITH A CITY PERMIT TO SEEK AN ADDITIONAL S.E.U. IN ORDER TO MOVE OUR BUSINESS AND NOT LOSE OUR HARD-EARNED LICENSE. WE WILL COLLECTED 100 SIGNATURES SUPPORTING OUR ATTEMPT TO REMAIN ACTIVE HERE IN ANN ARBOR. WE ASK THAT YOU LOOK AT THE ORDINANCE OF THE UNWRITTEN ROLE OF S.E.U. AS WELL. THANK YOU.
01:54:07.217: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WOULD WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT?
01:54:19.964: >> GOOD EVENING AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. I ACTUAL DIDN'T EXPECT TO MAKE ANY COMMENTS TONIGHT. AS THIS MEETING HAS GONE FORWARD, I THINK IT'S CLEAR THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW. NOT IF. I THINK IT'S OBVIOUS THAT ANN ARBOR WILL ALLOW RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA BUSINESSES TO PROLIFERATE IN THE COMMUNITY, BUT I THINK WE ARE LEFT WITH THE BIG HOW QUESTION. HOW DO WE IMPLEMENT THIS? WHAT IS THE CORRECT WAY TO IMPLEMENT THIS? I DON'T WANT TO TELL YOU HOW TO DO YOUR JOBS BUT I REMEMBER WHEN WE WENT THROUGH THE MEDICAL MARIJUANA ORDINANCE REVIEW, WE HAD A WHOLE REVIEW COMMISSION. I BELIEVE COUNCILMEMBER SMITH WAS ON THAT COMMISSION. I BELIEVE MR. LENART WAS THERE MANY A TIMES. IT'S HARD FOR ME TO REMEMBER WHO ELSE WAS THERE. BUT WE DID HAVE THAT TYPE OF COMMISSION. WE HAD A LOT OF COMMUNITY INPUT, AND WE HAD ALL OF THOSE THINGS BEFORE BEFORE WE CRAFTED THE MEDICAL MARIJUANA ORDINANCE WHICH LOOKING BACK HAS TURNED OUT TO BE A PRETTY GOOD ORDINANCE. I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE AN EASY JOB HERE AND I THINK YOU HAVE A LOT OF COMPETING -- COMPETING THINGS FROM ALL THE INDIVIDUALS HERE TONIGHT, BUT I WOULD MAKE A PROPOSAL. THAT WE DO WANT TO DO THIS FAST! I THINK IT'S OBVIOUS. EVERYBODY IN ANN ARBOR WA WANTSO HAVE RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA AND WANTS TO HAVE IT NOVEMBER 1st. I THINK THAT'S COME THROUGH LOUD AND CLEAR HERE TONIGHT. I WOULD PROPOSE, THOUGH, THAT THIS COULD -- THAT OUR COUNCIL LOOK AT THIS, AND REALIZE WHAT'S GOING ON. LOOK AT OUR ALREADY LICENSED MEDICAL MARIJUANA PROVISIONING CENTERS, ALLOW THEM TO GO INTO RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA MEDICAL PROVISIONING CENTERS AS LICENSED AND THEN TAKE THE TIME TO COMPLETELY CRAFT THIS ORDINANCE MOVING FORWARD. THAT WAY WE CAN HAVE WHAT WE WANT WHICH IS FAST. WHICH IS SOME RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA AVAILABLE IN ANN ARBOR, ON NOVEMBER 1st ON THE FIRST DATE THAT WE CAN ABSOLUTELY HAVE IT AND TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CRAFT THIS ORDINANCE AND MAKE SURE IT MEETS ALL OF THESE COMPETING NEEDS THAT EVERYBODY HAS COME OUT HERE TONIGHT. THANK YOU.
01:56:13.510: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
01:56:31.528: >> GOOD EVENING, I'M KELLY WAKOVICH, I'M A MOTHER OF A TODAYER AND A PRACTICING PEDIATRICIAN. IN REVIEW OF THE CURRENT RECREATIONAL DRAFT. I WAS SURPRISED BY THE LACK OF DETAIL FOR A CITY THAT HAS PERFECT PRIDED ITSELF FOR BEING A LEADER IN THIS AREA AND WAITED 50 PLUS JE YEARS FOR THIS TO COE TO FRUITION. I'M ENCOURAGED BY YOUR COMMENTS TODAY, IT SEEMS LIKE MANY OF YOU HAVE ASKED RELEVANT QUESTIONS ASKING FOR A BOARD, ASKING FOR SPEED AND RESOLUTION AND EQUITY TOO. OUR COLLEAGUES AND OUR BUSINESSES. MY CONCERN IS WITH THE DESIGNATED MARIJUANA CONSUMPTION BUSINESSES AND THE ARBITRARY CAP INCREASES THE PLACES WHERE MARIJUANA IS READILY PRESENT TO THE PEOPLE IN THE CITY OF 84. THAT'S THREE PER EVERY SQUARE MILE OF THE CITY. THIS APPEARS TO BE DONE WITHOUT CONSIDERATION OF THE POTENTIAL NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON CHILDREN, SPECIFICALLY THE YOUNGER CHILDREN IN OUR COMMUNITY, AS WELL AS RECOVERING ADDICTS WITHOUT INPUT FROM PARENTS OR THE COMMUNITY. AND I'M LESS CONCERNED WITH THE OVERALL NUMBER AND MORE CONCERNED ABOUT A SAFE AND COMFORTABLE ENVIRONMENT FOR THE FAMILIES THAT LIVE HERE AS WELL AS THE RECOVERYING ADDICTS WOULD DESERVE A SAFE SPACE. WHILE COUNCIL IGNORED MY AND MY MEDICAL COLLEAGUE CONCERNS REGARDING THE MEDICAL MARIJUANA RESTRICTIONS, AS FAR AS THE RESTRICTS TO SCHOOLS AND DAY CARES, I'M CURIOUS IF YOU MAY BE MORE MOVED GIVEN YOUR REALM OF POLITICS BY PUBLIC OPINION. SO BEFORE YOU IS THE MOP HOLE, ON PARENTAL ATTITUDES AND THE WISH TO BE COMMUNICATED WITH REGARDING MARIJUANA USE. THIS WAS DONE BY THE MOM POLL. IT'S A LARGE NATIONAL DEMOGRAPHIC THAT FOLLOWS AIL BUNCH OF FAMILIES IN DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE COUNTRY AS WELL AS DIFFERENT ENTITIES BUT IT'S REFLECTIVE OF OUR ANN ARBOR COMMUNITY AND IN THAT SURVEY 74% OF PARENTS WANT A RESTRICT BETWEEN MEDICAL MARIJUANA FACILITIES AND SCHOOLS AND 68 ALSO WANTED THAT SAME RESTRICTION WITH DAY CARES. IT'S BEEN BROUGHT UP BEFORE WHERE THIS WOULD BE FEASIBLE AND I WOULD SAY THAT IT IS FEASIBLE. WE HAVE SEEN IT IN SMALL COMMUNITIES, TO MORE MODERATE LIKE BOULDER, COLORADO, AND LARGE SCALE CITIES LIKE LOS ANGELES AND I WOULD ASK YOU NOT ONLY TO CONSIDER IT BUT ALSO TO BE CAREFUL TO ENGAGE PARENTS IN THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY IN A MORE MEANINGFUL WAY. OVERALL, I THINK THERE ARE MANY QUESTIONS TO BE ANSWERED. I THINK A BOARD WOULD BE HELPFUL. SOME QUESTIONS MORE AND MORE DETAILS AND I REALLY URGE YOU TO CONSIDER JUST A TEMPORARY. YOU HAVE WAITED ALMOST HALF A CENTURY. A COUPLE MORE WEEKS WOULD BE VALUABLE. TO HAVE A ROBUST SET OF REGULATIONS AND MAINTAIN SAFETY FOR OUR NUMBERS.
01:59:37.914: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
01:59:48.925: >> GOOD EVENING AND THANK YOU FOR THE TIME AND ATTENTION ON THIS. I KNOW THIS IS A TIME CONSUMING ISSUE ANY TIME IT COMES BEFORE THE CITY COUNSEL SIX MY NAME IS ALLISON IRTON I LIVE ON WICKFIELD COURT IN WARD ONE. AND I'M THE ATTORNEY FOR BLOOM CITY CLUB, WHICH IS ON MILLER AVENUE AND I KNOW MANY OF YOU SITTING UP HERE BECAUSE I WENT THROUGH THAT PROCESS -- THE MMFLA PROCESS ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF AGO. I JUST WANTED TO MAKE A COMMENT. I WASN'T PLANNING ON SAYING ANYTHING. I WAS JUST IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND SO I STOPPED BY RATHER THAN WATCHING FROM HOME. AND MR. JOE, THE ATTORNEY WHO SPOKE TWO SPEAKERS AGO, BROUGHT UP AN INTERESTING POINT. IF CITY COUNCIL IS UNSURE ABOUT HAVING 28 CONSUMPTION CENTERS AND 28 MICROBUSINESSES THAT THERE ARE PERMITTED LICENSING FACILITIES CURRENTLY IN ANN ARBOR THAT YOU COULD TO THE EXTENT THAT, YOU KNOW, THE STAFF AND THE ATTORNEYS TRIED TO JUST MIRROR WHAT CURRENTLY EXISTS AND OVERLAY THE MEERTMA, COULD YOU HAVE -- NOTICE VERY LITTLE CHANGE IN THE COMMUNITY, AND THEN HAVE THE PUBLIC, YOU KNOW, APPEARANCE OF NASH WITH ALL OF -- ANN ARBOR WITH ALL OF OUR RICH HISTORY OF SUPPORTING THESE TYPE OF MOVEMENTS AND THIS CAUSE, YOU KNOW, NOMAR G, ANN ARBOR ISALL ON BOARD ANDT CERTAIN PIECES OF THIS AFTER MORE CONSIDERATION WAS GIVEN TO NUMBER AND LIMBS AND WHERE AND HOW. -- LIMITS AND WHERE AND HOW. AND THAT'S WHAT MOVED ME TO COME UP AND SPEAK. IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S AN INTERESTING COMPROMISE THAT I DIDN'T HEAR PREVIOUSLY. AND I ALSO HEARD A LOT OF COMMENTS TONIGHT ABOUT HOW PROPERTY VALUE GOES UP WHEN ONE OF THESE THINGS GET LICENSED. THAT'S HAPPENING ALL OVER THE STATE. WHEN AMAZON MOVED INTO VIRGINIA, PROPERTY VALUES INCREASE. THAT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS WHEN NEW INDUSTRY MOVES IN. THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT GOOD. IT DOESN'T MAKE IT BAD. IT DOESN'T MAKE PEOPLE BAD IF THEY WANT TO ACQUIRE THESE PROPERTIES OR FLIP THEM TO SOMEONE ELSE WHO IS WILLING TO PAY MORE SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO OPERATE THE BUSINESS AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT OPERATING ONE OF THESE BUSINESSES IS NOT EASY. IT'S VERY ATTRACTIVE TO A LOT OF PEOPLE TO FLIP THESE TO SOMEBODY ELSE WHO HAS BEEN DOING IT FOR A LONG TIME. SO I JUST WANT TO CAUTION ABOUT MAKING ANY JUDGMENTS THAT THESE ARE -- THATT'S A GOOD THING OR A BAD THING. THE PROPERTY VALUES GO UP AND THE PEOPLE WANT TO SELL THEIR BUSINESS. SO THAT JUST LEADS ME TO MY FINAL THOUGHT WHICH WAS ON A CAP. YOU KNOW, AS MR. LENART SAID, WE HAVE 28 PERMITS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE AND ONLY 13 OR 15 PROVISIONING CENTERS ARE EVEN OPEN. IT MIGHT BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE WHEN 28 ARE FINALLY OPEN TO SEE HOW THAT, YOU -- YOU KNOW, WHETHER THE CAP SHOULD BE RAISED AND IF THE CAP IS RAISED, WHAT IS IT 30? AND THEN THERE ARE 30 PEOPLE THAT HAVE A MONOPOLY OR 32 PEOPLE HAVE A MONOPOLY, NUMBER 33 OR THE NEXT ONE IS ALWAYS GOING TO THINK THAT THE OTHERS HAVE A MONOPOLY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TONIGHT.
02:02:58.949: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT.
02:03:01.985: >> HI, EVERYONE, MY NAME IS LISA CON NE AND I'M WITH THE HOME OF MEDICINE, A MEDICAL CANNABIS PROVISIONING CENTER LOCATED ON MAIN STREET. I'M HERE TODAY TO EXPRESS SUPPORT FOR NOT ONLY A SENSIBLE ADULT USE ORDINANCE APPROVED BY THE NOVEMBER 1st TIME LINE, THAT THE STATE HAS GIVEN, POSITIONING ANN ARBOR ONCE AGAIN AS A CONTINUED LEADER ON THIS FRONT. BUT ALSO FOR IS SENSIBLE POLICIES SURROUNDING CONSOLIDATED CONSUMPTION SPACES. I INTERACT WITH THE PUBLIC AND OUR PATIENTS FREQUENTLY REGARDING THEIR CANNABIS USE AND THEIR DESIRE TO HAVE A COMMUNAL SPACE TO DO SO. IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT THE ORDINANCE PASSES ALONG WITH THE STATE'S TIMELINE SO WE CAN IMPLEMENT THE SYSTEM AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. AT OUR FACILITY, WE HAVE A LOUNGE WHERE WE HOST A NUMBER OF EVENTS IN HOUSE AS A WAY TO EDUCATE ON CANNABIS AND CREATE A FUN AND SAFE COMMUNITY FEEL. A NUMBER OF YOU HAVE VISITED OUR FACILITY AND HAVE WITNESSED THIS YOURSELVES. IT'S OWN THE NATURAL ORDER TO HAVE A SPACE FOR COMMUNITY EVENTS AND EDUCATION, TO INCLUDE THE CON ASSUMPTION OF CANNABIS. OUR COMMUNITY IS READY FOR THIS NOW. AS STATED BEFORE, THOSE UNABLE TO CONSUME IN THEIR OWN HOME, DUE TO RENTING OR LIVING IN PUBLIC HOUSING NEED A PLACE TO CONSUME CANNABIS AND ONE THAT ISN'T IN THE BACK ALLEYS, PUBLIC PARKS OR PUSHED TO THE OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN. THE FACT THAT PEOPLE WHO DO NOT OWN A HOME ARE UNABLE TO CONSUME CANNABIS WITHOUT FEAR OF PENALTY IS DISCRIMINATORY. THOSE INDIVIDUALS DESERVE THIS ORDINANCE TO BE PUT IN PLACE IN A TIMELY FASHION. WE ALSO WANT ALL INDIVIDUALS TO HAVE ACCESS TO A HEALTHIER OPTION FOR SOCIALIZING AND CONSUMING SOMETHING OF THEIR CHOICE. WE BELIEVE THAT HAVING DESIGNATED CONSUMPTION LOUNGES WILL ALLOW FOR ADULTS TO CONSUME CANNABIS WITHOUT SHAME. AT THIS POINT, IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT WE ALL KNOW AT LEAST AN ACQUAINTANCE THA
