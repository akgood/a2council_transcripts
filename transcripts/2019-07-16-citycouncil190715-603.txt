00:01:20.803: >> City Admin. Lazarus: WE DO. THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR'S UPDATE IS PROVIDED AS AN ATTACHMENT TO THE AGENDA. WITHIN THAT REPORT ARE THE JUNET AND THE JULY 2019 TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION PROJECT UPDATE. WE ALSO ATTACHED THE UPDATE ON CROSSWALK IMPROVEMENTS AND MAINTENANCE. TONIGHT'S AGENDA INCLUDES THE MDOT FOR THE ALLEN CREEK BERM OPENING PROJECT THIS PROVIDES A SIGNIFICANT CONNECTION BETWEEN THE BORDER TO BORDER TRAIL AND THE TREELINE TRAIL. THE TREELINE, ALLEN CREEK URBAN TRAIL MASTER PLAN WAS RECENTLY SELECTED AS THE RECIPIENT OF THE TRANSPORTATION PLANNING AWARD BY THE BY 2019 FOR THE MICHIGAN ASSOCIATION OF PLANNING FOR PLANNING. LENS. THE PROJECT WAS IN PART CHOSEN BECAUSE OF THE GATEWAY, THE PLACE MAKING AND SAFETY THAT ARE STRONG THROUGHOUT THE PLAN. SO WE THANK COUNCIL FOR THEIR ROLE IN APPROVING THAT PLAN. IN ADDITION MS. HEATHER SEYFERTH WHO HAS TAKEN OVER AS THE MAVEN OF THE TREELINE, WAS ALSO AWARDED THROUGH A PROJECT FOR IMPACTING YOUR CITY CLASS FOR THE COURSE THAT SHE HAD AT COMMUNITY HIGH SCHOOL THIS PAST SPRING TO HELP TEACH YOUTH CIVIC COMPETENCE AND PLANNING BASICS AND THAT WAS THE RECIPIENT OF A PUBLIC OUTREACH AWARD, ALSO FROM THE MICHIGAN ASSOCIATION OF PLANNING. MS. SEYFERTH HOPES TO EXPAND IT TO A LARGER YOUTH OUTREACH EFFORT. AS A REMAINDER ART FAIR IS THIS WEEK. WITH A ART FAIR, THERE'S A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE WEATHER, IN THE FORM OF THUNDERSTORMS. ISOLATED STORMS MAY BE CAPABLE OF WIND GUSTS UP TO 60 MILES PER HOUR. LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL IS ALSO POSSIBLE. MR. NORMAN, OUR EMERGENCY MANAGER ALSO TELLS US THAT THERE WILL BE A CHANCE FOR SHOWERS AN THUNDERSTORMS DURING MID AND LATE WEEK AS HOT AND HUMID CONDITIONS REMAIN OVER THE REGION. EVERYONE IS ENCOURAGED TO ENJOY ART FAIR BUT EXERCISE CAUTION AS WELL. I WANT TO THANK OFFICER HERR FOR PROVIDING SUPPORT. AND IT'S MY PLEASURE TO INTRODUCE CHIEF MICHAEL COX YOU TO THIS EVENING. TODAY WAS CHIEF COX'S FIRST DAY WITH THE ANN ARBOR POLICE DEPARTMENT. AND WE WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE A MOST CHEERFUL INTRODUCTION. CHIEF, THE FLOOR IS YOURS.
00:04:09.671: >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU ALL FOR SHOWING SOME CONFIDENCE IN ME IN LEADING IT GREAT CITY AND THE POLICE DEPARTMENT GOING FORWARD. I HOPE TO EARN ALL OF YOU ALLS TRUST THAT YOU PROVIDED IN ME. I CAN'T WAIT TO WORK WITH BOTH THE CITIZENS OF ANN ARBOR AND THE POLICE OFFICERS HERE AS WE GO FORWARD AND TRY TO ENHANCE OUR COMMUNITY POLICING.
00:04:36.398: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELCOME! [ APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU VERY MUCH, YOU WILL FIND THAT THERE'S ALMOST ALWAYS APPLAUSE WHEN YOU SPEAK AT THE PODIUM. YOU WILL GET USED TO IT. WE COME TO PUBLIC COMMENT RESERVE TIME. PUBLIC COMMENT RESERVE TIME IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE MEMBERS OF PUBLIC TO SPEAK TO COUNCIL AND THE COMMUNITY ABOUT MATTERS OF MUNICIPAL INTEREST TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT RESERVE TIME, ONE NEEDS TO HAVE SIGNED UP IN ADVANCE BY CONTACTING OUR CITY CLERK. SPEAKERS HAVE THREE MINUTES IN WHICH TO SPEAK. SO PLEASE PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE TIME CLOCK. AS A MATTER OF COURTESY, WE MAY ONLY HAVE ONE PERSON SPEAKING AT A TIME. IF YOU REQ NEED ASSISTANCE, FIRT MER IS MOZHGAN SAVABEISFAHNI.
00:05:32.354: >> THANK YOU, MAYOR. THAT WAS A VERY GOOD PRONUNCIATION. I WANT TO THANK YOU WHO CUT OFF AID TO ISRAEL AND RESPONDED TO IT. FOR MANY YEARS, WE WERE NOT ABLE TO GET THIS MESSAGE ACROSS BUT IT APPEARS THAT SOME OF YOU HAVE HEARD US AND SOME OF YOU HAVE HAD ENOUGH EWE MANTY IN YOU TO MOVE YOU TO ACTUALLY TAKE ACTION AND -- AND EMBRACE IT IN THAT YOU SAY WE NEED TO DISCUSS IT. LAST WEEK, WE DID GO TO THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION. THERE ALSO WE WERE WARMLY RECEIVED. WE SPOKE TO THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION AND OUR MESSAGE WAS QUITE UNDERSTOOD, AND NEXT MEETING OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION, WE WILL BE DISCUSSING CUTTING OFF MILITARY AID TO ISRAEL. I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU AND PEOPLE AT THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION FOR THEIR HUMANITY, AND FOR ACKNOWLEDGING THAT LIFE OF A PALESTINIAN IS WORTH IT. AND THAT ISRAEL IS AN ISSUE WE HAVE HERE AND THE UNITED STATES FINANCING OF ISRAELI MILITARY IS A SERIOUS, SERIOUS CRIME, ACTUALLY, AND WE SHOULD BE DISCUSSING IT AND AS SOON AS POSSIBLE CUTTING OFF MILITARY AID TO ISRAEL. JUST A REMINDER FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE NOT UP ON THE LITERATURE OF ISRAELI CRIMES, I WOULD LIKE TO TELL YOU THAT THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT HAS COMMITTED TO GIVING $38 BILLION DURING THE NEXT TEN YEARS TO THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT. THIS 38 BILLION WILL DIRECTLY -- DIRECTLY BE USED TO MASSACRE PALESTINIANS AS THEY HAVE BEEN FOR THE PAST MANY, MANY DECADES. WHAT WE WANT IS FOR ANN ARBOR TO SPEAK LOUD AND CLEAR AND SAY, NO MORE MILITARY AID TO ISRAEL. WE, THE AMERICANS WOULD PAY TAXES, FUND HEALTHCARE, FULL HEALTHCARE FOR EVERY ISRAELI. WE FUND THEIR FREE EDUCATION, PRETTY MUCH ALL OF THEIR HOUSING IS FREE BECAUSE THEY STEAL THE LAND. SO WHAT I'M SAYING, IT'S LET US KEEP THE $38 BILLION HERE. LET US FUND OUR OWN STUDENTS. LET US FUND OUR OWN HEALTHCARE, AND LET US CUT OFF THE MONEY TO ISRAEL. FIRST AND FOREMOST, LET US CUT OFF MILITARY AID TO ISRAEL. IT'S A VERY, VERY IMPORTAT GESTURE THAT THE -- THAT ANN ARBOR CAN MAKE. WE CAN BE THE FIRST CITY IN THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, TO PASS A RESOLUTION TO SAY THE LIFE OF PALESTINIANS MATTER AND WE CUT OFF MILITARY AID TO ISRAEL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
00:08:33.435: >> Mayor Taylor: OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS BLAINE COLEMAN.
00:08:43.145: >> THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION OF ANN ARBOR, WHICH IS APPOINTED BY THE MAYOR AND THE CITY COUNCIL PASSED A RESOLUTION TO COURAGE A CUT OFF OF MILL TEAR -- URGE A CUTOFF OF MILITARY AID TO ISRAEL. THEY PASSED THAT RESOLUTION IN 2003, AND IT'S HIGH TIME THAT THE CITY COUNCIL TOOK THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION'S ADVICE BACK THEN, AND VOTES FOR THAT RESOLUTION NOW. ISRAEL HAS SHOT MANY THOUSANDS PALESTINIANS SINCE THAT RESOLUTION WAS FIRST PASSED. ISRAEL HAS SHOT THOUSANDS OF PALESTINIANS DOWN IN GAZA IN THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF. HUNDREDS OF THEM ARE DEAD. THOUSANDS OF THEM ARE GOING TO BE ON ARTIFICIAL LIMITS, CRUTCHES AND WHEELCHAIRS IF THEY CAN GET THEM. IF YOU DON'T WANT TO PASS THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION'S RESOLUTION, YOU CAN CERTAINLY PASS YOUR OWN SEVEN WORD RESOLUTION WHICH SAYS THE SAME THING. WE ARE AGAINST MILITARY AID TO ISRAEL. GOT IT? WE ARE AGAINST MILITARY AID TO ISRAEL. SIMPLE. GETS TO THE POINT. AND IT STOPS ISRAEL FROM PULLING THE TRIGGER ON MORE THOUSANDS OF PALESTINIANS. ISRAEL IS AN EXTREMELY RACIST, EXTREMELY VIOLENT STATE, WHICH HAS BEEN IN BUSINESS FROM DAY ONE MURDERING PALESTINIANS AND DRIVING THEM OFF THEIR LAND. THAT'S WHAT ISRAEL IS ABOUT. THIS CITY COUNCIL HAS PASSED NUMEROUS RESOLUTIONS FOR ISSUES OF A NATIONAL AND GLOBAL NATURE. THIS RESOLUTION AGAINST MILITARY AID TO ISRAEL WILL BE NO DIFFERENT. THIS CITY COUNCIL VOTED FOR A BOYCOTT AGAINST APARTHEID SOUTH AFRICA IN 1985 AND RIGHTLY SO. THIS CITY COUNCIL VOTED FOR BOYCOTT AGAINST BURMA IN 1999. THE ONLY VOLTS AGAINST -- IF I REMEMBER -- WERE A REPUBLICAN COUNCILMEMBER NAMED LUMM, JANE LUMM AND A REPUBLICAN COUNCILMEMBER NAMED KWAN, DAVID KWAN. THIS CITY COUNCIL ALSO JUST FEBRUARY OF 2019, THIS CITY COUNCIL VOTED TO SUPPORT BOYCOTT AGAINST WENDY'S TO SUPPORT THE FARM WORKERS. ALL OF THESE HUMAN RIGHTS RESOLUTIONS WERE A GOOD THING. AND WHEN YOU APPROVE A HUMAN RIGHTS RESOLUTION TO STOP MILITARY AID TO ISRAEL, THAT WILL BE A GOOD THING TOO. IN FACT, YOU WILL BE SAVING THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF LIP LIVES. YOU WILL BE PROTECTING PALESTINIANS.
00:11:44.659: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS DECKY ALEXANDER.
00:11:52.200: >> I AM AN AMERICAN JEW. I HAVE NEVER BEEN TO ISRAEL OR WARSAW OR ODESSA, OR THE TENMENTS OF THE LOWER EAST SIDE OF THE NEW YORK. MANY OF THE PLACES THAT MY ANCESTORS HAD TO LAND SO THEY COULD LIVE SO I COULD LIVE. UNLIKE MANY OF MY JEWISH AMERICAN CONTEMPORARIES, I HAVE NOT YET VISITED THE LAND WHEN NOT IF, THE WORLD, THE TOWN, THE WARD I LIVE IN CURRENTLY DECIDES DOESN'T LOVE ME BACK AND THEN THIS PLACE ISRAEL WILL TAKE ME. REGARDLESS IF I DISAGREE WITH THE POLICIES AND THE POLITICIANS, IT WILL ALLOW ME AND ALL THE FUTURE MES A PLACE TO INVENT OR INNOVATE, RIGHT OR WANDER. I WANTED TO SHARE HOW I FEEL ABOUT THE COUNCIL'S MOVE TO USE AND EMPOWER THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION'S OUTSIDE OF THE PURSUE OF ITS MISSION AND PURPOSE TO BE A MECHANISM ON POLICY AGAINST ISRAEL. A COUNTRY MADE UP OF AN INTERNATIONAL HUMAN MINORITY, JEWS. IT DOESN'T FEEL VERY HUMANE OR VERY RIGHT. LESS FAMILIAR WITH THE WORKINGS OF THIS CITY COUNCIL, I UNDERSTAND ITS CHARGE IS TO DEAL WITH AMONG OTHER THINGS ROAD DIETS AND INFRASTRUCTURE, GREEN SPACE, AND NOW IT SEEMS INTERNATIONAL POLICY. THIS IS HOW IT BEGINS, THEY SAY. FIRST IT'S ABOUT POTHOLES AND ROADS AND THEN IT'S ABOUT FIXING THE POTHOLES AND ROADS AND THEN JEWS AND THEIR CARS CAUSING THE POTHOLES IN THE ROADS. A SIGNIFICANT TENSION IN ISRAEL AMERICAN JEWS AND AMERICAN RELATIONS IS THAT THERE ARE AS MANY AMERICAN JEWS DO NOT SUPPORT CURRENT ISRAEL POLICIES IS THAT MANY FEEL ANTI-ISRAEL SENTIMENT IS ANTI-JEWISH SENTIMENT. THIS TRUTH APPEARS TO BE THE LEAST UNDERSTOOD AMONG NON-JEWS. IT'S TRUE. WE CAN DO A BETTER JOB OF MAKING O OUR VOICES AAS JEWS. WE DON'T SHARE MOMENTS OF DIRECT HATE OR BIAS OR LOVE AT US IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS OR WORK SPACES. AS THIS COUNCIL HAS OPTED OR COOPTED THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION TO FOCUS ON MATTERS OUTOF ITS STATED PURPOSE AND BYLAWS I ASK FOR THE REMOVAL. RESOLUTION OF ANTI-ISRAEL, ANTI-JEWJEWISH INQUIRY INTO THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION. BEFORE YOU USE THE VENEER OF A COUNTRY, TO MASS WHACK REALLY IS TO MANY OF US A LEGACY OF OTHERRING AND OSTRACIZING, RECOGNIZE THE UNFORGIVING HISTORIES WE ARE ALL PART OF AND THAT NO MATTER HOW YOU SPIN IT OR HOW YOU JUSTIFY IT, CALLING OUT ONE COUNTRY, THE ONLY PREDOMINANTLY JEWISH COUNT FRIDAY IN THE WORLD -- COUNTRY IN THE WORLD AND NOT OTHERS JUST DRIPS HATE. THANK YOU.
00:14:45.707: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS JOAN LOWENSTEIN.
00:14:57.085: >> THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. AT THE LAST CITY COUNCIL MEETING, COUNCILMEMBERS HAYNER AND RAMLAWI TOOK SPECIAL NOTE OF THE ANTI-ISRAEL PROTESTERS WHO HAVE BEEN PEPPERING THE COUNCIL FOR YEARS WITH PROPAGANDA AND UNTRUTHS. THESE COUNCILMEMBERS HAVE PRESSURED THE HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL TO STRAY FROM ITS PURPOSE WHICH IS TO ENFORCE THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF ANN ARBOR RESIDENTS, AND WASTE VALUABLE TIME IN A DEBATE THAT HAS NO IDENTIFIABLE OUTCOME BECAUSE OUR CITY HAS NO INFLUENCE ON FOREIGN POLICY. IF IT DID, THE CITY MIGHT WANT TO ADDRESS SOME REAL HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES. AN INVESTIGATION RECENTLY DETERMINED THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF VENEZUELA HAS KILLED 9,000 PEOPLE IN THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF. HUNDREDS OF AFRICAN REFUGEES HAVE DROWNED LEAVING COAST OF LIBYA BECAUSE EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS FAILED TO ACT. CHINA IS JAILING JOURNALISTS AND ARTISTS AND BASHING PROTESTERS IN HONG KONG. THE PHILIPPINES HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION ESTIMATES THAT THERE HAVE BEEN 27,000 EXTRA JUDICIAL KILLINGS THERE IN THE LAST THREE YEARS. JUST LAST WEEK, AN N.G.O. IN THE UNITED KINGDOM FOUND THAT THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT HAS KILLED 4,000 PALESTINIANS WHO WERE LIVING THERE IN SYRIA DURING THE CIVIL WAR. A FEW WEEKS AGO, THE FORMER PRESIDENT OF EGYPT DIED OF NEGLECT AS A POLITICAL PRISONER IN JAIL. ON OUR OWN U.S. SOUTHERN BORDER, THOUSANDS OF REFUGEES ARE BEING HELD IN CAMPS, IN HORRIBLE, UNJUSTIFIABLE CONDITIONS, CHILDREN SEPARATED FROM PARENTS, SOME DYING OF CURABLE ILLNESS. THERE ARE ABOUT 200 COUNTRIES IN THE UNITED NATIONS AND ONLY ONE OF THEM, ISRAEL, IS A JEWISH STATE. WITH ALL THE HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES GOING ON IN THE WORLD, WHEN YOU UNFAIRLY SINGLE OUT THE ONE JEWISH STATE AS TWO COUNCILMEMBERS HAVE DONE, THE IMPLICATIONS ARE OBVIOUS.
00:17:14.255: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS KATHLEEN HIRAGA.
00:17:20.195: >> HELLO, EVERYONE. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK ON A SUBJECT, AIRBNB AND SHORT-TERM RENTALS IN THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. IN ANN ARBOR, THE ACCELERATION OF RESIDENTIAL HOUSES AND APARTMENT BUILDINGS BEING PURCHASED FOR THE SOLE USE OF RENTING OUT TO TRANSIENT SHORT-TERM GUESTS THROUGH DIGITAL PLATFORMS IS INCREASING. I THINK EVERYBODY HAS HAD SOME KIND OF INTERACTION WITH AIRBNB PRO OR CON. MY NEIGHBORHOOD, WHICH IS A FAIRLY HUMBLE NEIGHBORHOOD, VERY RESIDENTIAL, WOODLAND DRIVE, HAS RECENTLY HAD A COUPLE OF AIRBNBs, ONE ADJACENT TO ME AND ONE ACROSS THE STREET. A COUPLE DOCTORS IN TOWN HAVE DECIDED TO BUY AND CONVERT TO AIRBNBs. THESE ARE NOT LONG-TERM ARE RENTALS. I -- LONG-TERM RENTALS. I HAD THREE DIFFERENT PEOPLE COMING IN AND OUT, CARS PARKED, ET CETERA, ET CETERA, IN THE LAST WEEK. I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE CITY AND OTHER CITIES ARE BEING IMPACTED BY. I HAVE CREATED A CASE STUDY OF A COUPLE OF CITIES. ONE IS SANTA MONICA, CALIFORNIA, WHERE I USED TO LIVE FOR 20 YEARS. THAT HAS BEEN AN ISSUE FOR, I GUESS ABOUT TEN YEARS, 28% OF ALL OWNERS ACTUALLY RESIDE THERE. SO THE QUALITY OF LIFE, I THINK, IS REALLY BEING IMPEDED, EITHER BY THE FOOTBALL OR THROUGHOUT THE YEAR ART FAIR INCLUDED. I REALIZE THERE IS A SHORTAGE OF HOTEL SPACE, BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I THINK THAT IT'S INCUMBENT UPON THE CITY TO ACT ON THIS. I HAVE A COUPLE OF IDEAS THAT I WOULD LOVE TO SHARE AT SOME OF THE COFFEE CHATS. I DID HAVE A CHAT WITH JACK AND ELIZABETH. SO I WOULD LIKE TO JUST DISCUSS AT SOME POINT, SOME OF THE OPTIONS AND SOME OF THE CASE STUDIES THAT I HAVE LOOKED AT INCLUDING LARGER CITIES, SEATTLE, LOS ANGELES, TOKYO HAS EVEN BANNED LAST SIX MONTHS COMPLETELY BANNED ALL BNBs AND THIS IS PRIOR TO THE 2020 OLYMPICS. SO I THINK EVERYONE GLOBALLY IS TAKING A HARD LOOK AT THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU.
00:19:24.786: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. ARE THERE COMMUNICATIONS TODAY FROM COUNCIL? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
00:19:32.093: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, MAYOR, AND THANK YOU TO THE AUDIENCE MEMBERS WHO SHOWED UP TO SPEAK. KATHLEEN, I APPRECIATE YOU COMING TOGETHER TO TALK ABOUT THE AIRBNB ISSUE. MANY ON COUNCIL HAVE ALREADY EXPRESSED CONCERN AND WE ARE LOOKING INTO THE MATTER. AND HOPEFULLY GOING TO COME OUT SOON WITH SOME NEW POLICIES SO GOVERNMENT CAN CATCH UP WITH PRIVATE INDUSTRY. I WANT TO GO ON RECORD TO DEFEND MYSELF. I FEEL IT VERY IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW, MY LIVELIHOOD IS UNDER ATTACK, UNDER THREAT, BOYCOTTS HAVE NOW BEEN TALKED ABOUT, ABOUT MY RESTAURANT OF 30-SOME YEARS HERE IN ANN ARBOR. I WOULD LIKE TO CORRECT FORMER COUNCILMEMBER JOAN LOWENSTEIN AND D.D.A. BOARD MEMBER. DID I NOT GO ON RECORD AT THE JULY 1st MEETING TO DISCUSS THIS ISSUE OF BOYCOTT ISRAEL. YOU CAN GO BACK AT THE TAPES, LOOK AT THEM. I DON'T THINK YOU WERE WATCHING THE MEETING. I THINK YOU ARE JUMPING TO CONCLUSIONS, VERY DANGEROUS CONCLUSIONS. ONE THAT JEOPARDIZES THE LIVELIHOOD OF MYSELF AND THE 40 PEOPLE THAT WORK FOR ME. THE ISSUE THAT GOT ME INVOLVED IS THE FACT THAT I'M THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION LIAISON. A H HAT I WEAR PROUDLY. AS THE ONLY BROWN PERSON UP HERE, I FEEL THAT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ME TO EVERYBODY SN THAT COMMISSION. AS SOMEONE WOULD HAS BEEN A PART OF THE PALESTINIAN STRUGGLE FOR ALL OF MY LIFE, CONSIDERING IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR 71 YEARS NOW, 101, IF YOU REALLY GO BACK TO THE BELFOUR DOCUMENTS THAT STARTED THIS MESS BACK IN 1918. I'M NOT A STRANGER TO THE CONTROVERSY. SO AT THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION MEETING, COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER HAD DIRECTED THE ADVOCATES WHO HAVE BEEN COMING IN FOR 17 YEARS TO GO TO THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION TO HAVE THE ISSUE ADDRESSED THERE. SO AT OUR LAST MEETING, IT WAS DISCUSSED ON WHETHER IT WOULD EVEN BE BROUGHT UP AND BE ALLOWED TO BE DISCUSSED. AND WHETHER THE ISSUE ITSELF, THE TOPIC -- AND THE TOPIC WAS NOT ABOUT BOYCOTT. THERE WAS NO BOYCOTT IN THAT ORIGINAL RESOLUTION IN 2003. MLIVE TOOK LIBERTIES AND USED A HEADLINE THAT WAS MISLEADING TO WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THAT MEETING. THAT MEETING WAS ABOUT WHETHER THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION UNDER ITS MANDATE SHOULD DISCUSS THE ISSUE OF ISSUES OUTSIDE OF OUR CITY'S BOUNDARIES AND BEYOND, AND WHETHER THESE ISSUES THAT ARE GOING IN YEMEN OR IN THE WEST BANK ARE THINGS THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION SHOULD BE DID DEBATING. IT DID NOT SINGLE OUT ISRAEL, THE DISCUSSIONS THAT WE HAD. IT WAS NOT ABOUT BOYCOTT. IT'S ABOUT WHETHER WE CAN HAVE A DISCUSSION AT THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION ABOUT THE ATROCITIES THAT ARE BEING COMMITTED THROUGHOUT THIS WORLD. AND IF IT'S NOT GOING TO OCCUR AT THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION MEETING WHERE IS IT GOING TO OCCUR? AT A BOWLING ALLEY? AT THANKSGIVING DAY DINNER? THIS IS CITY HALL. THIS IS POLITICS. IT'S A PLACE FOR UNCOMFORTABLE CONVERSATIONS. SO I JUST WANT TO GO ON RECORD RIGHT NOW AND CLEAR THE AIR. I DO NOT STAND FOR BOYCOTTING AND DIVESTMENT. I DO STAND FOR FREE SPEECH AND FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION. SO MS. LOWENSTEIN, I DO -- YOU OWE ME AN APOLOGY AT THE VERY LEAST. [ APPLAUSE ]
00:23:49.283: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER COMMUNICATION FROM COUNCIL?
00:23:51.285: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I AM NOT DONE.
00:23:52.887: >> Mayor Taylor: OH, MY APOLOGIES.
00:23:54.088: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THE ISSUE THAT I HAVE WITH OUR FOREIGN POLICY IS THAT IT VIOLATES INTERNATIONAL LAW. IT VIOLATES OUR OWN FEDERAL LAWS BECAUSE THE WEAPONS THAT WE SELL OTHER NATIONS ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE USED FOR OFFENSIVE PURPOSES. THEY ARE USED ALL THE TIME OWE OWE -- OFFENSIVELY. SO WE ARE VIOLATING SOME LAWS AND WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO SAY THAT PUBLICLY WITHOUT BEING SHAMED. AND THE TREASURES THAT WE SPENT ON FOREIGN WARS SINCE 9/11, WE SPENT $6 TRILLION. SO WHEN PEOPLE ARE UP HERE ASKING US TO FIX THE ROADS AND WE NEED BETTER CROSSWALKS AND WE NEED THIS, GUESS WHAT, WE ARE GETTING LESS FEDERAL DOLLARS. WE ARE GETTING LESS STATE DOLLARS BECAUSE WE ARE SPENDING THEM ON FOREIGN WARS. SO THERE IS A CONNECTION. I'M FINISHED. THANK YOU. [ APPLAUSE ]
00:24:52.480: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
00:24:53.881: >> Councilmember Griswold: ON A MORE POSITIVE NOTE, I WOULD LIKE TO ANNOUNCE THAT ON JULY 29th, WHICH IS TWO WEEKS FROM TODAY, THAT WILL BE A FIFTH MONDAY OF JULY, AND SO THERE WILL NOT BE  A COUNCIL MEETING, BUT SOME OF OUR COUNCILMEMBERS WILL BE HOLDING A COMMUNITY CONVERSATION AND THE TOPIC IS ACCELERATING IMPROVEMENTS IN PEDESTRIAN SAFETY. I STATED SOME FACTS AT A PREVIOUS MEETING, AND AS A RESULT, THIS WAS QUITE A BIT OF ACTIVITY ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND WHAT IT REVEALED TO ME IS THAT THERE REALLY ISN'T A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF SOME OF THE PRINCIPLES THAT ARE BEING USED NOW, INCLUDING IN ANN ARBOR, BUT SUCCESSFULLY IN NEW YORK CITY, IN MANY CITIES IN EUROPE, AND THE MOST CORRESPOND NAME IS VISION ZERO. IT'S BASED ON QUALITY IMPROVEMENT METHODOLOGY. IT IS VERY, VERY SUCCESSFUL. THE CITY. ANN ARBOR HAS INVESTED IN THIS PROGRAM BY HIRING A CONSULTANT WITH EXPERTISE IN THIS AREA, $400,000 CONTRACT. WE WANT TO GET MOST FOR THAT MONEY THAT WE CAN, AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS I WILL BE HAVING THIS SESSION IN TWO WEEKS. I ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO COME. SOME OF MY DATA WAS DISPUTED, AND IT'S NOT THAT MY DATA IS NOT RIGHT. IT'S THAT THERE IS MANY -- THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT WAYS TO DESCRIBE THIS AND WE ALL NEED TO BE TALKING TOGETHER SO THAT WE CAN REDUCE PEDESTRIAN CRASHES AND CYCLING CRASHES AND THIRDLY JUST ROADWAY CRASHES TO THE ABSOLUTE LOWEST LEVEL POSSIBLE. AND I ALSO WAS REFERRED TO AS ZERO VISION, RATHER THAN VISION ZERO, BECAUSE ZERO IS NOT ATTAINABLE, BUT I WOULD LIKE TO REPORT THAT IN MAY, WE HAD ZERO PEDESTRIAN CRASHES AND IN JUNE WE ONLY HAD ONE. GRANTED OUR PEDESTRIAN CRASHES GO DOWN IN THE SUMMER WHEN THE STUDENTS LEAVE, BUT IT IS ATTAINABLE AND IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE COME TOGETHER AS A COMMUNITY AND WORK TO REDUCE CRASHES AND CREATE THE SAFEST COMMUNITY WE CAN POSSIBLY HAVE. THANK YOU.
00:27:18.692: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
00:27:20.261: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. YES, I THINK IT'S INTERESTING. I WOULD LIKE TO FOLLOW UP WITH WHAT COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI SAID. I KNOW THAT MR. STANTON HERE IS DESPERATE TO FIRE UP THE CLICKS AND MISCHARACTERIZE THINGS THAT ARE SAID HERE IN THIS CHAMBER. THAT'S FINE. THAT'S HIS JOB. BUT WHEN OTHER PEOPLE WHO COME HERE AND KNOW BETTER, AND SAY I HAVE PRESSURED THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION OR THE CITY HAS NO INFLUENCE ON FOREIGN POLICY, WELL, THE WAY IT WORKS IS CITY, COUNTY, STATE, FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WE'RE AN INCORPORATED BODY. THAT'S THE HIERARCHY. AND SO WE HAVE A POLICY AGENDA. WE'RE CONSTANTLY ASKING THE STATE TO DO THINGS AND WE'RE PASSING IT UP THE FOOD CHAIN AS IT WERE. THE IDEA THAT THE CITY HAS NO INFLUENCE ON THINGS HIGHER UP THAN US IS JUST -- IS JUST NOT SO. AND, YOU KNOW, IN FACT -- I MEAN SEVERAL PEOPLE HAVE REACHED OUT TO ME IN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS AND IT'S ANALOGOUS TO SAYING, WELL, HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO EARL. ISRAEL? NO. BUT I HAVEN'T BEEN TO ANTARCTICA, BUT I BELIEVE IT WHEN THE ICE CAPS ARE MELTING. I DON'T HAVE TO BE THERE TO KNOW IT. I HAVE FAMILY IN ISRAEL. AND SO THEY CAN TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT AND THEY HAVE. AND SO THIS IS NOT ABOUT ISRAEL, BUT HUMAN RIGHTS GENERALLY. IT'S ALSO ABOUT OUR RESPONSIBILITY -- ALL THE RESPONSIBILITIES TO -- TO WORK FOR PEACE AND ALSO OUR -- OUR -- THE FACT THAT WE ARE ALLOWED TO CRITICIZE U.S. FOREIGN POLICY, AND IF WE'RE NOT CRITICIZING U.S. FOREIGN POLICY, WHO IS GOING TO? AND THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. THIS IS NOT ABOUT ISRAEL OR VENEZUELA OR ANY OF THESE OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE TERRIBLE THINGS ARE HAPPENING, INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES. IT'S ABOUT U.S. FOREIGN POLICY AND IT'S ABOUT EXPORTING SMALL ARMS ALL OVER THE WORLD. AND EXPORTING TERROR AND PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THIS VERY ROOM WILL LOVE TO STIR UP THESE THINGS AND POINT TO ME A GUN NUT, THIS PERSON IS THAT WAY, THIS PERSON IS THAT WAY. HOW MANY A.R.s DO YOU THINK WE SEND TO ISRAEL AND THE MIDDLE EAST AND ALL OF OUR OTHER ALLIES ALL AROUND THE WORLD? MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF SMALL ARMS ARE EXPORTED EVERY YEAR. BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN FOREIGN AID ARE GIVEN OUT THAT COMES BACK TO US IN ARMS SALES. I'M COMPLAINING ABOUT U.S. FOREIGN POLICY. I'M NOT SINGLING OUT A NATION OR A PEOPLE. DO WHAT YOU WILL TO MISCHARACTERIZE THE SITUATION FOR POLITICAL GAIN. IT'S NOT STICKING TO ME AND I WILL NOT BACK DOWN. AISLE PROUD FOR -- FOR YEARS, AS LONG AS I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO IT, I HAVE BEEN WORKING FOR PEACE AND THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT. SO THANK YOU.
00:30:17.204: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
00:30:18.172: >> Councilmember Bannister: I GOT A LATE BREAKING PHONE CALL FROM SUMI KAILASAPATHY AND SHE WANTED ME TO SPEAK FOR HER OR THROUGH HER ABOUT -- THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO -- IN LIGHT OF SOME OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S COMMENTS ABOUT SOME OF THE WOMEN OF COLOR SERVING IN CONGRESS THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO ASSURE THE PEOPLE OF COLOR THAT THIS IS ALL OF OUR HOME, AND WE ARE ALL OF YOUR SISTERS AND BROTHERS. AND THEN ON A LOCAL NOTE, JUST A FOLLOW-UP TO THE RESOLUTION, WE PASSED ON JULY 1st, HERE AT COUNCIL TO URGE THE WASHTENAW COUNTY ROAD COMMISSION TO REDUCE HERBICIDE USE THROUGH ADOPTION OF A COMPREHENSIVE ROADSIDE VEGETATION CONTROL PLAN, BASED ON BEST ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. THE COUNTY ROAD COMMISSION IS HAVING A MEETING TOMORROW AT 1:00 TUESDAY TOMORROW THE 16th AT 555 ZEEB ROAD AND THEY WILL TAKE UP THE ISSUE OF ANY CHANGES TO THEIR ROADSIDE VEGETATION PROGRAM AND THEIR HERBICIDE USE. SO THANK YOU, EVERYONE, FOR HELPING MOVE THAT FORWARD.
00:31:33.414: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
00:31:37.251: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. FIRST, JUST TO ANNOUNCE PUBLIC PARTICIPATION MEETING. I HAVE SAT ON THE GREEN BELT COMMISSION FOR A LONG TIME AND THE GREENBELT ADVISORY COMMISSION AS IT MOVES TOWARDS THE SECOND HALF OF THE MILLAGE IS MOVING FORWARD WITH A STRATEGIC PLANNING PROCESS AND WE ARE HOPING TO GET LOTS OF INPUT FROM THE PUBLIC. THE FIRST OF THE THOSE THREE MEETINGS WILL BE MONDAY, JULY 29th, FROM 5:30 TO 7:30 AAT THE ANN ARBOR DISTRICT LIBRARY WEST GATE BRANCH. SO IF YOU ARE ENTERED IN LAND PRESERVATION, OUTSIDE OF THE CITY THROUGH THAT MILLAGE AND HAVE SOME IDEAS ABOUT THE STRATEGIC PLAN, PLEASE DO COME AND PARTICIPATE. THERE WILL ALSO BE MEETINGS ON AUGUST 15th, AND SEPTEMBER 5th, WHICH ONE AT THE TRAVER BRANCH AND ONE AT CITY HALL. I HAVE DEBATED FOR A LONG TIME WHETHER TO SAY ABOUT THE ISSUES BROUGHT TO THE COUNCIL TONIGHT. ONE, BECAUSE AS -- AS A FAIRLY SECULAR JEW, I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN REALLY HESITANT TO SPEAK UP ON THESE ISSUES BECAUSE -- BECAUSE I KNOW THAT -- BECAUSE I NEVER WANTED TO SPEAK FOR ALL JEWS IN ANN ARBOR SUPPOSE OPINION AND PEOPLE ARE DIVERSE, BUT IT IS A COMMUNITY THAT I'M PROUD TO BELONG TO. I'M ALSO PROUD TO SIT ON THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION AND PART -- PART OF WHY I HAVE NEVER WANTED TO RESPOND AND PART OF WHY COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER'S COMMENTS AT THE LAST MEETING WERE BOTH SURPRISING AND HURTFUL TO ME, IT'S IN THE JUST ABOUT THE MESSAGE, BUT IT'S ALSO ABOUT THE BEHAVIOR AND TREATMENT OF SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES BY THOSE WHO HAVE COME BEFORE COUNCIL. IT'S WHEN COUNCILMEMBER EATON WAS CALLED A NAZI, I BELIEVE. IT'S WHEN COUNCILMEMBER WARPEHOSKI WAS CALLED NAMES AND WE ARE CALLED MURDERERS WEEK IN AND WEEK OUT. THAT'S NOT SOMETHING I WANT TO GIVE A LOT OF ATTENTION TO, BUT I JUST WANT TO PROVIDE THAT CONTEXT FOR WHY I WAS REALLY TROUBLED BY THOSE COMMENTS. YOU KNOW, IT'S ALSO RELATED TO ACTIVITIES THAT HAVE HAPPENED AND NOT MY OWN CONGREGATION, BUT AT BETH ISRAEL CONGRESS WHICH SITS IN THE THIRD WARD WHICH I REPRESENT. WE ARE AN ENTIRE GENERATION OF CONGRECONGREGANTS HAVE PUT IN SL NOTICES FOR LIFE EVENTS FOR BAR MITZVAHS TO WARN OUT-OF-TOWN GUESTS THAT THERE WILL BE PROTESTERS AT THEIR CONGREGATION. I FIND THAT ABHORRENT AND WHILE I CERTAINLY SUPPORT FREE SPEECH, I REALLY DO FEEL FOR -- FOR THOSE PEOPLE IN MY COMMUNITY AND WHO LIVE IN THE WARD THAT I REPRESENT AND IT'S JUST -- IT'S JUST BEEN INCREDIBLY UNFAIR TO THOSE RESIDENTS THAT THEY HAVE HAD TO GO THROUGH THAT. I ALSO SIT ON THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION AND I HAVE A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT INTERPRETATION OF WHEN WENT DOWN AT THAT MEETING AND -- OF WHAT WENT DOWN AT THAT MEETING AN I CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO ACCUSE ANY COVERAGE OF MISATTRIBUTING ANYTHING. I THINK IF YOU TALK TO EVERYBODY, THERE'S PROBABLY 12 DIFFERENT OPINIONS OF WHAT WENT DOWN AT THAT MEETING. IT'S AN INTIMATE SPACE. IT'S ONE WHERE I THINK OUR COMMISSIONERS ARE TRYING TO BE RESPONSIVE TO THOSE WOULD COME BEFORE THEM, AND -- TO THOSE WHO COME BEFORE THEM AND IT'S ONE WHERE WE HAVE A LOT OF NEW MEMBERS OF THAT COMMISSION, AND AT THAT MEE MEETING LESLIE STANBAUGH STEPPED IN AND SAID SHE WAS NOT SUPPORTIVE AND THOUGHT IT WAS OUTSIDE OF THE ORDINANCE THAT GOVERNS THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION, AND MAYBE EVEN MANDATE IS TOO STRONG OF A WORD. AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I IMMEDIATELY SUGGESTED AND I WAS VERY FORTUNATE THAT OUR CITY ATTORNEY MR. POSTEMA WAS THERE, WAS THAT AT OUR NEXT MEETING WE HAVE JUST A PRIMER FOR EVERYONE WHO -- YOU KNOW, CONSIDERING THAT WE HAD A LOT OF TURNOVER ON THAT COMMISSION, AND I THINK IT NEVER HURTS TO HAVE THAT FOR ANY COMMISSION FROM TIME TO TIME, JUST TO -- JUST TO GET SOME INPUT FROM STAFF AND FROM OUR ATTORNEY'S OFFICE ABOUT WHAT THE MISSION AND THE PURPOSE OF THE ANN ARBOR HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION ACTUALLY IS. AND -- AND TO THEN CONSIDER REQUESTS SUCH AS THIS, WITHIN THAT CONTEXT. SO I DON'T EVEN LOOK AT IT AS STRONGLY AS THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION COMING FORWARD TO SAY, THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE TAKING UP THIS ISSUE. I LOOK AT IT AS THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION WITH MANY NEW MEMBERS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT -- WHAT THEIR SCOPE OF PURPOSE IS AND DO YOU REQUESTS LIKE THIS AND OTHERS THAT COULD COME FORWARD FELT IN WITH WHAT THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION DOES. WE HAVE A RALLY -- WE ARE SO FORTUNATE TO HAVE A DIVERSE GROUP OF DEDICATED CITIZENS THAT SIT ON THAT GROUP AND I DON'T WANT THEM TO BE VILIFIED BY EITHER SIDE BECAUSE -- AND I DON'T WANT THEM TO BE CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS AND I 40EN HE THAT THEY WON'T BE. I WOULD RATHER TAKE THAT HEAT AS LIAISON THAN HAVE THESE VOLUNTEERS GO THROUGH THAT BUT THAT'S NOT CERTAINLY WHAT THEY SIGNED UP FOR. BUT I HOME THE COMMUNITY BETTER UNDERSTANDS THAT IT'S REALLY A CONVERSATION OF A GROUP WHO IS DEDICATED TO HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES OF ALL KIND BUT MOSTLY IN THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS APPROPRIATE WHEN THEY GET CITIZEN REQUESTS. SO WE OFTEN GET CAUSE TO RAISE THE LEVEL OF DISCOURSE AT THIS TABLE. I HOPE WE CAN KEEP IT THIS AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS PARTICULAR CONVERSATION. AND THANKS FOR LISTENING.
00:37:56.663: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
00:37:57.798: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANKS. JUST A QUICK POSTSCRIPT IF I MAY ON THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT WE ALL RECEIVED TODAY, THE CITY ISSUED A PRESS RELEASE ABOUT THE GREENBELT STRATEGIC PLAN. COUNCILMEMBER GRAND IS CORRECT THAT WE LAUNCHED THIS EFFORT WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE GREENBELT, IT'S A 30-YEAR MILLAGE AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WE HAVE TAKEN THIS KIND OF LOOK AT THE GREEN BELT. SO WE ARE 15 YEARS INTO THIS. IT'S THE FIRST TIME. THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A VERY BIG DEAL. AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S BEING CONTEMPLATED OVER THE YEARS. I HAVE BEEN SUBMITTING QUESTIONS FROM TIME TO TIME ABOUT THIS. AND THE DATES THAT THE CITY SELECTED AND ARE INCLUDED IN THIS PRESS RELEASE ARE HONESTLY DATES WHEN NOT A WHOLE LOT OF PEOPLE ARE IN TOWN. JULY 29th, AUGUST 15th, AND SEPTEMBER 5th. SO I REACHED OUT TO THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR TO RESCHEDULE THIS WHEN MORE PEOPLE ARE AROUND AND COULD PARTICIPATE AND WE COULD HEAR FROM THEM OBVIOUSLY. SO I THINK THAT'S -- I SEE YOU NODDING MR. LAZARUS. SO I HOPE THAT WE'LL DO THAT.
00:39:11.071: >> City Admin. Lazarus: COUNCIL. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM BROUGHT THE ISSUE UP AT THE ADMIN MEETING THIS AFTERNOON. I THINK SOMETHING AS IMPORTANT AS THE GREENBELT MASTER PLAN SHOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THE MAXIMUM OPPORTUNITIES FOR PARTICIPATION. SO WHAT I COMMITTED TO HER IS THAT I WOULD TALK TO FOLKS IN COMMUNITY SERVICES AND SEE HOW WE CAN RESTRUCTURE THE SCHEDULE TO PROVIDE MORE OPPORTUNITIES AND WE'LL DO THAT IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS.
00:39:38.632: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU.
00:39:39.900: >> City Admin. Lazarus: YOU'RE WELCOME.
00:39:45.071: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN. ZACK >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I ALSO DEBATED WHETHER OR NOT TO DISCUSS THE ISSUE OF U.S. RELATIONS WITH ISRAEL. I'M ALSO A JEWISH MEMBER OF THIS BODY. I GREW UP ATTENDING A SYNAGOGUE AND A CONGREGATION THAT BEARS THE NAME OF ISRAEL. IT'S A CONGREGATION THAT'S BEEN IN THIS COMMUNITY FOR 100 YEARS, ACTUALLY 102. BETH ISRAEL. AND GROWING UP IN THIS CONGREGATION, BEING BAR MITZVAHED IN THAT CONVERSATION AND GOING TO HEBREW SCHOOL AT THAT CONGREGATION, THREE DAYS A WEEK. YOU LEARN THAT YOUR IDENTITY AS AN AMERICAN-JEW IS ALSO AN IDENTITY THAT CAN BE PROTESTED. EVERY SATURDAY WHEN MY FAMILY WENT TO WORSHIP, OUR GOD AND BE PART OF OUR COMMUNITY BE PROUD OF OUR HERITAGE, PICKETERS GREETED US. THAT'S PART OF THE REALITY OF BEING JEWISH IN ANN ARBOR, AND HAS BEEN FOR THE LAST 14, 15 YEARS. 16 YEARS THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER LUMM. THESE ARE SENSITIVE TOPICS. THESE ARE TOPICS THAT I WRESTLE WITH PERSONALLY. AS SOMEONE WOULD BELIEVES IN A JEWISH HOMELAND BUT DISAGREES SO MUCH WITH THE POLICY THAT COMES FROM THE STATE OF ISRAEL, I'M TORN. BUT TO CLAIM THAT THESE ARE ISSUES NOT OF -- OF HOW WE TREAT JEWISH PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD, BECAUSE THEY ARE SIMPLY U.S. FOREIGN POLICY ISSUES IS A LUXURY. IT'S A LUXURY BECAUSE THE REALITY IS THERE WOULD NOT BE A JEWISH HOMELAND WITHOUT U.S. FOREIGN AID. THE NUANCES OF THAT FOREIGN AID AND HOW IT'S DEPLOYED, I DON'T KNOW AND I DON'T KNOW HOW IT SHOULD BE. I'M NOT IN THE U.S. SENATE, AND I DON'T HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL MANDATE TO DETERMINE THOSE THINGS. I DO HAVE A MANDATE TO REPRESENT THE PEOPLE OF ANN ARBOR AND THESE LOCAL ISSUES. AND I CAN WITH SOME CONFIDENCE SPEAK TO OUR $400 MILLION BUDGE BUDGET. I CAN SPEAK TO THE NUANCES OF ROAD DIETS AND THE NUANCES OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. I CANNOT SPEAK TO THE NUANCES OF AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY ADMINISTERED TO THE MIDDLE EAST. AND I DON'T THINK ANY OF US CAN AND I DON'T ANY OF US NECESSARILY SHOULD, BECAUSE WE HAVE TASKS AT HAND. IMPORTANT TASKS AT HAND THAT WE HAVE BEEN ENTRUSTED WITH. AND WHILE I WOULD LOVE TO SIMPLY PASS A SEVEN WORD RESOLUTION THAT SPOKE TO THE POWER THAT IS THE STATE OF ISRAEL -- AND FRA FRANKLY, POWER THAT MAY BE WIELDED UNJUSTLY, IT'S MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT AND IT'S MORE COMPLICATED THAN THIS CHAMBER. AND IT'S SIMPLY NOT OUR JOB. AND SO I WOULD JUST -- I WOULD OFFER TO COUNCILMEMBERS, TO COLLEAGUES TO MEMBERS OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION WHO ENGAGE IN THIS SUBJECT TO KNOW YOU ARE ENGAGING IN 16 YEARS OF INTENSE EMOTION THAT IS ON THE BACKS OF GENERATIONS OF EMOTION SINCE THE HOLOCAUST. AND TO OPEN UP THIS DIALOGUE TO SAY YOU ARE FOR FREE SPEECH IS ALSO TO OPEN THE DIALOGUE AND OPEN THE OPPORTUNITY FOR MEMBERS OF RECOGNIZED HATE GROUPS WHO HEADQUARTER THEMSELVES IN THIS CITY TO DENY THE HOLOCAUST AND DO SO HOUSED IN THIS CITY HALL. AND THAT'S THE RIGHT AND THEY COME MONDAY TO MONDAY, FROM TIME TO TIME, AND THAT'S THEIR RIGHT. BUT THE MICROPHONE THAT WE CHOOSE TO GIVE THEM WILL BE ON US. AND I DON'T MEAN TO SPEAK ABOUT THE RESIDENTS HERE. I DON'T KNOW. I FRANKLY HAVE NEVER SEEN THEM --
00:43:54.120: >> WE NEVER DENIED THE HOLOCAUST. THAT'S A SLANDER.
00:43:59.826: >> Mayor Taylor: PLEASE.
00:44:00.360: >> Councilmember Ackerman: I'M NOT SPEAKING OF YOU.
00:44:03.563: >> WE ARE AGAINST ISRAELIS MURDERING PALESTINIANS, PERIOD.
00:44:13.306: >> Councilmember Ackerman: I'M NOT SPEAKING OF YOU. THE -- THESE ARE REAL TOPICS. THESE ARE REAL THINGS WE WILL GRAPPLE WITH IF WE CHOOSE TO ENGAGE IN THESE SUBJECTS. THESE ARE THINGS THAT ARE PAINFUL FOR AN IMPORTANT AND BEDROCK COMMUNITY OF ANN ARBOR, THE JEWISH COMMUNITY. AND I SUPPOSE I WILL LEAVE IT THIS. I DIDN'T PREPARE THESE REMARKS AND PERHAPS I WILL PREPARE SOMETHING IF THIS CONVERSATION CONTINUES, BUT IT'S A PAINFUL ONE. AND I APPRECIATE THE SENSITIVITY IF THIS IS A ROAD WE TRAVEL TOWN.
00:45:02.422: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER COMMUNICATION FROM COUNCIL? I WOULD LIKE TO REQUEST CONFIRMATION OF THE FOLLOWING APPOINTMENT PRESENTED TO CITY COUNCIL, JULY 1st, 2019, THE BUILDING BOARD OF APPEALS, BRUCE CARSON. MAY I HAVE A MOTION TO PLEASE? MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER NELSON, AND SECONDED BY SMITH. DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. WE NOW COME TO OUR CONSENT AGENDA. MAY I HAVE A MOTION TO APPROVE THE CONSENT AGENDA. MOVED BY SMITH AND SECONDED BY RAMLAWI. DISCUSSION OF THE CONSENT AGENDA. COUNCILMEMBER BANNIST.
00:45:36.189: >> Councilmember Bannister: I WOULD LIKE TO PULL CA-4 AND CA-8.
00:45:40.827: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE CONSENT AGENDA? COUNCICOUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
00:45:47.767: >> Councilmember Hayner: JUST A DISCUSSION ON CA-9. WHEN WE HAVE CONTRACTS WITH TREE PLANTING MARGOLIS THAT WE HAVE A BOND THAT THE TREES TO HAVE A CERTAIN LIFE EXPECTANCY. I WANTED TO MAKE THAT REMARK PUBLICLY. WE SEE ALL KIND OF DEAD TREES ALL OVER THE CITY AND IT'S NOT CHEAP. I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT I -- I WAS HAVING SOME I.T. WOES. I COULDN'T PULL UP THE ENTIRETY OF THAT RFP EARLIER, THAT CONTRACT. MR. HUPY, COULD YOU LET US KNOW IF THERE IS SUCH A THING IN THERE?
00:46:21.434: >> YES, THERE IS. AND THEY ARE REQUIRED TO WATER FOR THE FIRST YEAR ALSO.
00:46:27.073: >> Councilmember Hayner: OKAY. I APPRECIATE THAT. A LOT OF RESIDENTS ASKED ME ABOUT THAT.
00:46:33.346: >> YES.
00:46:33.613: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU.
00:46:35.949: >> TO CLARIFY IF, I MAY.
00:46:39.085: >> Councilmember Lumm: IS MARGOLIS OR THE RESIDENTS. IS IT THEY MARGOLIS OR THE PROPERTY OWNERS.
00:46:45.625: >> THE CONTRACTOR. THE CONTRACTOR.
00:46:48.761: >> Councilmember Hayner:  IS THAT CONSIDERED, LIKE -- AND THEN WHAT IF THE TREE DIES ANYWAY DO THEY REPLACE THEM IN THE FIRST YEAR?
00:46:56.703: >> YES, THEY REPLACE THEM, GENERALLY NOT IN THE SAME YEAR THAT THEY DIE. THEY COME BACK AND REPLACE IT THE NEXT PLANTING PERIOD. WE GENERALLY PLANT TREES IN THE SPRING AND IN THE FALL, NOT DURING THE HEAT OF THE SUMMER.
00:47:11.617: >> Councilmember Hayner: RIGHT. OKAY. THANK YOU.
00:47:13.987: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
00:47:15.154: >> Councilmember Bannister: AND MR. HUPY, HOW DOES MARGOLIS COORDINATE WITH CREME BOLI. IS THAT ANOTHER VENDOR THAT WE HAVE FOR TREE PLANTING IN THE RIGHT-OF-WAY?
00:47:28.901: >> I'M NOT SURE WHAT YOU ARE REFERRING TO. WE MAY HAVE A CONTRACTOR PLANTING UNDERNEATH CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT RESTORATION, DIFFERENT THAN MARGOLIS.
00:47:43.216: >> Councilmember Bannister: I'M JUST -- I GOT A PHONE CALL OVER THE WEEKEND FROM A WARD 3 RESIDENT WHO SAID THERE WERE FIVE STREET TREES PRESENTED THIS THEIR RIGHT-OF-WAY OVER IN WARD 3, AND IN JULY AND THEY ALL PROMPTLY DIED.
00:48:00.299: >> WELL, IT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN OUR CONTRACTOR IN JULY, BECAUSE THAT'S MIDDLE OF SUMMER. SO IF YOU CAN GIVE ME THE LOCATIONS, EMAIL ME THE LOCATIONS AND I WILL FOLLOW UP.
00:48:10.076: >> Councilmember Bannister: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
00:48:13.946: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
00:48:14.847: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, MAYOR. LATE LAST YEAR, COUNCILMEMBER, MYSELF AND ACKERMAN BROUGHT FORTH A RESOLUTION, THE FIRST ONE THAT I HAD THE PLEASURE OF BRINGING AND PASSING ABOUT CITIZENS JOINING WITH OUR EFFORTS TO PLANT TREES IN THE RIGHT-OF-WAY. HOW WILL THAT GO ALONG WITH THIS, IF IT DOES? IS IT GOING TO BE MEASURABLE? WILL WE SEE ANY KIND OF METRICS?
00:48:40.406: >> THERE IS -- THE PROGRAM IS SET UP. THE CITIZENS CAN PARTICIPATE IN THIS. THERE IS A COST SHARE ON BEHALF OF THE CITIZENS DOING THAT, AND IT IS OUTSIDE OF THESE TREES. IT WOULD BE IN ADDITION TO THE NORMAL CONTRACTED TREES.
00:48:57.690: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: WOULD IT BE THIS COMPANY DOING THE WORK?
00:49:00.026: >> IT WOULD BE THE -- I'M NOT GOING TO SAY BECAUSE I'M NOT -- I WAS GOING TO SAY NO BUT I --
00:49:04.964: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  SO WE HAVE MANY COMPANIES THAT --
00:49:07.066: >> NO. NO. THERE'S VERY FEW, BUT I WILL GET BACK TO YOU AS TO WHO PLANTS THE TREES. ACTUALLY, IF I'M REMEMBERING THE PROGRAM CORRECTLY, WE DIG THE HOLE AND THE CITIZEN PLANTS THE TREE AND DOES THE BACKFILL. IT IS NOT A COMPANY PLANTING IT.
00:49:24.283: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: NOT A COMPANY PLANTING IT.
00:49:26.619: >> City Admin. Lazarus: NO, THE GREENBELT HEMENT THAT WE HAVE HAVE -- THE AGREEMENT THAT WE IS THAT THE PROGRAM -- ESSENTIALLY THE PROPERTY OWNER, THE RESIDENT BUYS THE TREE. WE HELP THEM PLANT IT. THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MAINTENANCE, AND I WOULD IMAGINE AS THE SEASON GETS CLOSER FOR WHEN WE PLANT TREES, WE WILL ADVERTISE THE PROGRAM A LITTLE MORE STRENUOUSLY.
00:49:47.573: >> WE DIG THE HOLE FOR TWO REASONS. ONE IS USUALLY THE GROUND IS PRETTY HARD TO DIG. AND SECONDLY, WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MISSED DIGS IS CLEARED AND THERE'S NO STRIKE ON UNDERGROUND UTILITIES.
00:50:04.957: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: CAN I GET A CLARIFICATION ON WOULD PLANTS THE TREES?
00:50:08.594: >> THE CITIZEN DOES.
00:50:10.229: >> City Admin. Lazarus: WITH OUR ASSISTANCE.
00:50:12.098: >> YES.
00:50:13.566: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I GUESS I CAN TAKE THIS UP. --
00:50:17.136: >> Councilmember Ackerman: PUBLIC WORKS DIGS THE HOLE AND THEN THE CITIZEN HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY PUT THE SAPLING INTO THE GROUND AND COVER IT BACK UP SO THAT THEY ARE PART OF THE PRO E SIS.
00:50:25.678: >>PROCESS.>> Councilmember Raml THE CITIZEN IS ALSO PAYING $135 FOR THE HOLE?
00:50:33.519: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THE HOLE AND THE TREE.
00:50:35.521: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: WHY DON'T WE PUT THE TREE IN THE HOLE WITH THEM.
00:50:37.890: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  I HOPE WE COULD WITH ASSISTANCE, I SHOULD SAY.
00:50:41.093: >> City Admin. Lazarus: THE GOAL OF THE PROGRAM IS TO ENGAGE OUR RESIDENTS WHO, YOU KNOW, RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF TREES. THE REASON WE HAVE A COST OF THE TREES IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S OWNERSHIP AND IT'S CARED FOR, AND AS YOU KNOW, OUR FORESTRY CREWS, OUR PUBLIC WORKS GREWS ARE VERY GOOD AT WORKING WITH THE PUBLIC AND ASSIST THEM SO THERE'S THE I DON'T KNOWJOINT THE OWNERSHIP OE TREE. DIGGING THE HOLE IS HARD WORK. THERE'S A PARTNERSHIP THAT EXISTS.
00:51:13.759: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: WELL, I WOULD STRESS IN ORDER FOR THESE THINGS TO SUCCEED THAT WE DO THE WHOLE A TO Z AS WE WOULD NORMALLY. MAYBE NOT COME BACK AND WATER THEM AS WE NORMALLY DO, BUT I FIND WE STOP A LITTLE SHORT.
00:51:26.272: >> WE DON'T DIG THE HOLE AND WALK AWAY. WE ARE THERE AS THEY ARE PLANTING IT.
00:51:29.809: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: OKAY.
00:51:33.112: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE CONSENT AGENDA. COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
00:51:36.782: >> Councilmember Ackerman: JUST AS A CLARIFYING POINT. THE ORIGIN OF THE PROGRAM WERE A COUPLE OF RESIDENTS WHO HAD INTEREST IN THEMSELVES PLANTING THE TREE IN THE RIGHT-OF-WAY BUT SIMPLY WANTED TO DO IT THROUGH THE PROPER PROTOCOLS AND PROCEDURES. THOSE WERE REALLY BURDENSOME, LIKE $500 TO GO THROUGH AN APPROVED VENDOR. AND SO THIS IS TRYING TO BRING THAT COST DOWN TO MORE LIKE $130, $150, AND ALSO AYOU LOCAL COMALLOW THEMTO BE PART OF PROCE THEIR HANDS IN THE DIRT.
00:52:09.048: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR OF THE CONSENT AGENDA WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CA-4 AND CA-8. ALL IN FAVOR. [CHORUS OF AYES] ALL OPPOSED? THE CONSENT AGENDA WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CA-4 AND CA-8 IS APPROVED WITH 11 COUNCILMEMBERS PRESENT, ALL VOTING IN THE AFFIRMATIVE, THUS SATISFYING THE EIGHT VOTE REQUIREMENT WITH RESPECT TO CA-16, CA-17, AND CA-18. CA-4 RESOLUTION TO APPROVE FAIRVIEW CEMETERY RULES AND REGULATIONS. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER AND SECONDED BY BANISTER. DISCUSSION OF C-4.
00:52:46.952: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES, WELL, ON PAGE 8. FAIRVIEW CEMETERY RULES AND REGULATIONS, WE START WITH THE GENERAL RULES. AND NUMBER 9 SAYS PETS ARE NOT ALLOWED IN THE CEMETERY. AND AS IT TURNS OUT, LOTS OF PEOPLE IN WARD 1, IN THE AREA, ENJOY STROLLING THROUGH THE BEAUTIFUL TREE-LINED CEMETERY WITH THEIR DOGS ON A LEASH. AND ALSO HOPEFULLY PICKING UP AFTER THEIR DOGS AS NEED BE. SO COULD WE AMEND OR STRIKE RULE NUMBER 9 ABOUT PE PETS NOT ALLOWED?
00:53:33.566: >> Councilmember Hayner:  A FOLLOW-UP QUESTION, IF I MAY. IS THAT STANDARD FOR OTHER CEMETERIES IN THE CITY? I KNOW THIS IS THE CITY CEMETERY.
00:53:41.574: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE SOMEONE ON STAFF? PLEASE.
00:53:45.678: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I'M SORRY. THIS JUST CAME TO OUR ATTENTION.
00:53:48.247: >> THAT'S OKAY. THE REQUEST TO ADD THE BAN ON PETS WAS FROM OUR SEXTON AND HE THE ROADSIDE VE ROA REPORTS TO S ARE UNLEASHED AND WE CONTACTED ANN ARBOR POLICE TO ENFORCE BUT THERE'S NO BAN IN THE CEMETERY ON UNLEASHED PETS. SO THAT'S WHERE WE ARE AT.
00:54:16.375: >> IT SAYS NO PET EXERCISING.
00:54:20.112: >> Mayor Taylor: I FORGET WHO HAD THE FLOOR. COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
00:54:23.315: >> Councilmember Bannister: WE HEARD FROM SOME RESIDENTS. WE HAVE ONE OF THE NEIGHBORS WITH US FROM ARGO DRIVE, SAYING IT'S NO EXERCISING, PERSONS OR PETS. [ OFF MICROPHONE COMMENTS ]
00:54:39.265: >> NO P PET EXERCISING IS CURRENTLY THE RULE.
00:54:43.669: >> Councilmember Hayner:  AS POSTED.
00:54:45.237: >> IT IS POSTED. [ OFF MICROPHONE COMMENTS ]
00:54:51.577: >> Mayor Taylor: SO IS THIS SOMETHING YOU WOULD LIKE TO POSTPONE AND PERHAPS COME BACK.
00:54:55.047: >> Councilmember Bannister: REVISIT AND HAMMER OUT. IF MS. BEAUDRY THINKS THERE'S ANY HOPE.
00:55:05.090: >> Mayor Taylor: PERHAPS LET'S POSTPONE THIS UNTIL THE NEXT MEETING AND YOU BOTH AS INTERESTED CAN WORK WITH THE CLERK TO FIGURE OUT WHERE WE ARE GOING WITH IT.
00:55:11.697: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WOULD MOVE TO POSTPONE THIS.
00:55:15.367: >> Mayor Taylor: TO.
00:55:15.868: >> Councilmember Eaton: THE NEXT MEETING.
00:55:17.803: >> Mayor Taylor: SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER. IS THAT GOOD? DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR. [CHORUS OF AYES] POSTPONED. CA-4, IT'S POSTPONED TO OUR NEXT MEETING. CA-8, RESOLUTION 1, PREPARE PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS FOR THE PROPOSED BARTON DRIVE RESURFACING PROJECT'S SIDEWALK GAP PORTION SPECIAL ASSESSMENT, AND APPROPRIATE $25,000 FROM THE GENERAL FUND OF THE BALANCE FOR THE DESIGN. MOVED BY BANNISTER, AND SECONDED BY GRAND. COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
00:55:49.735: >> Councilmember Bannister: THE REASON I PULLED THIS, IS NOT TO MAKE A CONTROVERSY OUT OF THE SIDEWALKS ON BARTON DRIVE, BUT MAINLY TO JUST GIVE A CALL OUT TO THE POTENTIALLY IMPACTED NEIGHBORS. THIS RESOLUTION ONE IS PART OF THE FOUR RESOLUTION SIDEWALK PROCESS. SO UPON PASSING THIS RESOLUTION, IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING NEIGHBORS WILL BEGIN TO BE NOTIFIED OF THE PROCESS. AND SO THEY MAY BE GETTING THE LITTLE BITTY POSTCARD IN THE MAIL OR A LETTER OR SUCH AND SO I JUST WANTED TO SPEAK TO THOSE NEIGHBORS. THERE'S 23 PARCELS AFFECTED. THEY ARE ON BARTON DRIVE. HILLDALE DRIVE AND OAK PARK DRIVE. AND DUE TO SOME OF THE PRIVACY RULES THAT THE CITY TRIES TO ADHERE TO, ANT EVEN THOUGH I HAE REQUESTED THAT COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER AND I ARE CONNIEED ON YOUR COMPLAINTS OR CONCERNS OR QUESTIONS SO WE CAN STAY IN THE LOOP AND HELP REPRESENT YOU AND HELP GUIDE THE WAY, BECAUSE OF PRIVACY, WE'RE HAVING SOME STRUGGLE GETTING COPIED IN. SO THIS IS THE FORUM THAT I WANTED TO NOTIFY NEIGHBORS ON THOSE STREETS THAT COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER AND I ARE -- ARE HERE TO HELP REPRESENT YOU AND HELP GUIDE YOU THROUGH THE PROCESS. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY COMPLAINTS OR PHONE CALLS SO FAR, AND IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT A TREE INVENTORY WILL BE PREPARED AND THAT WILL INCLUDE THE CURRENT AGE OF THE IMPACTED TREES THAT MAYBE NEED TO BE REMOVED AND ALSO THEIR LIFE SPAN. SO WE'LL BE SENSITIVE TO THE TREES AND IF ANYONE WAS WONDERING ABOUT OUR COMPLETE STREETS POLICY AND WILL BIKE PATHS WILL BE INCLUDED IN THE PROCESS, I HAVE BEEN INFORMED THAT BIKE LANES ARE -- WILL BE -- ARE SEPARATE. THEY WOULD BE PART OF THE STREET DESIGN, THE ROAD DESIGN, AND THAT IS NOT PART OF WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT HERE. WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT WITH THIS RESOLUTION IS JUST NEW SIDEWALKS ALONG THESE ROADS.
00:58:07.306: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER AND THEN GRISWOLD.
00:58:11.510: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES THANK YOU. SOME OF THESE GAPS ARE DESPERATELY NEEDED, CLOSER TO THE -- CLOSER TO THE ENTRANCE OF THE BOARDWALK AND SO ON AND CLOSER TO THE WEST END AND THEY WERE DISPUTED WHEN THEY CAME UP TO THE SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOL, WHEN IT COMES ALL THE WAY AROUND TO STARWICK, THE FOLKS ON STARWICK, WHO OWN A COUPLE OF HOURS ON THE CORNER WERE NOT THRILLED WHEN THIS WAS PART OF THE S SAFE ROAD TO SCHOOLS. I MEAN, WE WILL MOVE THIS FORWARD BUT IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF WE HAD SOME COMMENTS FROM THE PEOPLE WOULD SIT IN FRONT OF THESE PROPERTIES THAT WAS PART OF THE SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOL. SINCE I MUTTERED THOSE WORDS SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOLS FOR THE THIRD TIME, I WILL LET EVERYBODY KNOW THAT THE FOLKS OVER AT NORTH SIDE STEAM ARE REVISITING THAT PROJECT AND THEY ARE CONSIDERING REAPPLYING FOR A GRANT IN THE NEXT GRANT CYCLE AND HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH STAFF, I UNDERSTAND, A BIT AND WORKING ON THEIR OWN SOMEWHAT TO KIND OF GET A SENSE OF WHAT'S, YOU KNOW -- KIND OF FILL OUT THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND THE COUNCIL, IF IT'S WORTH BRINGING IT FORWARD AGAIN. I SEE SOME OF THESE PROJECTS ARE AS WE PROMISED TO THOSE NEIGHBORS, THEY WILL GET SIDEWALKS ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. AND I THINK THIS WAS PART OF THAT. I JUST WANTED TO SHARE THAT WITH EVERYBODY. I MEAN, I THINK WE SHOULD MOVE IT FORWARD TO THE PUBLIC HEARING ASPECT. THAT'S UP TO YOU TO DECIDE. THIS IS JUST THE FIRST PART.
00:59:44.336: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? I'M SORRY. SORRY. COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
00:59:49.441: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I HAVE A QUESTION FOR STAFF REGARDING. THIS I REALIZE IT WAS PART OF THE SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOL PROGRAM INITIALLY, AND IF WE PASS THIS RESOLUTION TONIGHT, AND WE HAVE A NEW SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOL PROGRAM AND ONE THE DISCUSSIONS HAS BEEN TO GO FORWARD THAT DOES NOT THREW TRAVER AND ADDRESS TRAVER, THEN THERE WOULD BE FUNDING THEORETICALLY FOR THIS PROJECT. IF WE APPROVE THIS RESOLUTION, WOULD IT TAKE OUT OF ANY SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOL PROGRAM OR COULD IT STILL BE INCLUDED?
01:00:31.450: >> LET ME SEE IF I UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION. NICK HUTCHINSON, THE ENGINEER. THE PROJECT THAT'S IN FRONT OF US RIGHT NOW, THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT, IS MOSTLY FOR THE SIDEWALK NORTH OF BARTON TO THE WEST OF PONTIAC, BUT ALSO THAT ONE PIECE BY STARWICK AS WELL.
01:00:51.870: >> Councilmember Griswold: MM-HMM.
01:00:53.338: >> IF THIS PROJECT, IF -- IF SOMETHING -- YOU KNOW, IF THE SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOL COMMITTEE AT STEAM DECIDES TO REAPPLY FOR A GRANT, WHAT IS INCLUDED IN THAT GRANT RIGHT NOW, I DO NOT KNOW. BUT WE COULD NOT APPLY THIS WHOLE PROJECT TO THE STEAM GRANT BECAUSE THAT'S NOT WHAT WAS ORIGINALLY APPLIED FOR.
01:01:25.304: >> Councilmember Griswold: CORRECT. BUT I'M TOLD THAT THIS SIDEWALK WAS IN THE ORIGINAL DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS WHEN THE PROFESSORS CAME DOWN FROM MICHIGAN STATE AND THEY SORT OF GAVE US --
01:01:34.880: >> ABOUT THREE PARCELS. IT WAS ONLY THE PIECE AT BARTON AND STARWICK THAT WAS PART OF THE STEAM PROJECT AND REST OF IT WAS NOT.
01:01:46.625: >> Councilmember Griswold: THE REASON I WAS ASKED,  I THOUGHT IT WAS COST LESS WHEN IT'S IN THE SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOL. I DID GET AN EMAIL THAT THERE IS A LARGE SPRUCE TREE PLANTED IN THE RIGHT-OF-WAY IN THIS AREA, AND SO I'M WONDERING WHEN ENGINEERING IS OUT THERE IF THEY CAN DETERMINE IF THIS IS A SSIGHT DISTANCE ISSUE.
01:02:13.652: >> I KNOW WE HAVE DONE THE TO. TOPOGRAPHIC SURVEY OUT THERE. WE HAVEN'T STARTED ANALYZING IT AND CERTAINLY SIGHT DISTANCE IS GOING TO BE A KEY FACTOR IN A LOT OF STUFF WE LOOK AT ON THE DESIGN, NOT JUST THE SIDEWALK DESIGN BUT THE ROAD DESIGN AS WELL. PART OF THE ROAD DESIGN WHICH IS NOT PART OF THIS RESOLUTION, IS LOOKING AT APPROPRIATE CROSSWALK LOCA LOCATIONS AND THS OF THAT AND SIGHT DISTANCE IS ALSO AN ISSUE OUT THERE.
01:02:41.880: >> Councilmember Griswold: GREAT. THANKS.
01:02:43.682: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. ALL IN FAVOR. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? CA-8 IS APPROVED WITH 11 COUNCILMEMBERS PRESENT, ALL VOTING IN THE AFFIRMATIVE, THUS SATISFYING THE EIGHT VOTE REQUIREMENT. WE NOW TO PUBLIC HEARINGS. PUBLIC HEARINGS ARE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO SPEAK TO COUNCIL AND THE COMMUNITY ABOUT A SPECIFIC ITEM ON THE AGENDA, THE SPECIFIC SUBJECT OF THE PUBLIC HEARING. TO SPEAK AT A PUBLIC HEARING, YOU NEED NOT TO HAVE SIGNED UP IN ADVANCE BUT YOUR SPEECH MUST RELATE TO THE SUBJECT OF THE PUBLIC HEARING. SPEAKERS WILL HAVE THREE MINUTES IN WHICH TO SPEAK. SO PLEASE PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE TIME CLOCK. AS A MATTER OF THE COURTESY, WITH HE MAY HAVE ONLY ONE PERSON SPEAKING -- WE MAY HAVE ONLY ONE PERSON SPEAKING AT A TIME. IF YOU REQUIRE ASITTANCE IN SPEAKING BEFORE COUNCIL TODAY, WE WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO PROVIDE IT TO YOU. PUBLIC HEARING ONE. AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND SECTIONS 1:311, 1:316, 1:317, 1:319, AND 1:324 IN CHAPTER 14 (PURCHASING, CONTRACTING AND SELLING PROCEDURE) OF TITLE I OF THE CODE OF THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. IS THERE ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING. SEEING NO ONE THIS PUBLIC HEARING IS CLOSED. PUBLIC HEARING NUMBER TWO. RESOLUTION NUMBER 4, CONFIRMING THE SINGLE LOT SPECIAL ASSESSMENT 1425 PONTIAC STREET PROJECT SPECIAL ASSESSMENT ROLL. IS THERE ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING? PLEASE JUST COME RIGHT ON UP.
01:04:17.709: >> THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THIS EVENING, TO THE NUMBER OF COUNCILMEMBERS WHO REACHED OUT OR RESPONDED TO THE LETTER I SENT TO EACH OF YOU, I'M PARTICULARLY GRATEFUL. YOU MADE A DIFFICULT PROCESS THAT I WAS INVOLVED WITH LATE EASIER TO NAVIGATE. IN PARTICULAR I WANT TO THANK ANN BANNISTER WOULD HAS BEEN THERE AT EVERY TURN, ASKING QUESTIONS, MAKING INTRODUCTIONS AND ADVOCATING FOR MEMBERS OF A WARD IN A WAY THAT I NEVER EXPERIENCED. YOUR COMMITMENT IS IMPRESSIVE AND APPRECIATED. SPEAKING TO THE MATTER AT HAND. I ASK THAT YOU VOTE AGAINST PH-2, RESOLUTION 4, CONFIRMING THE SPECIAL ASSESSMENT AT 1425 PONTIAC. I ASK THIS, TO BEST UNDERSTAND THE PRIORIZATION OF SAFETY NEEDS TO CONTINUE TO ENSURE THAT WE ADDRESS AND CRITICAL SAFETY NEEDS WITH THE LIMITED RESOURCES WE HAVE. I WANT TO ADD THAT IT IS APPEARED FROM THE BEGINNING THAT THIS OUTCOME TO THIS PROCESS MAY HAVE BEEN DECIDED BEFORE THOSE AFFECTED WERE EVEN HEARD OUT, WHICH IT WAS THE INITIAL INFORMATION I RECEIVED FROM THE CITY HALL OR FROM THE CITY STAFF, THE COUNCILMEMBER THAT HAD NOT MUCH TIME TO LISTEN BUT A GREAT DEAL OF OPINION OR SIMPLY WALKING OUT MY DOOR INTO THE YARD AND SEEING ALL THE SIDEWALK MARKED OUT FOR CONSTRUCTION, ORANGE BARRELS THERE READY TO GO BEFORE THE HEARING EVEN STARTED OR A VOTE TONIGHT HAD EVEN TAKEN PLACE. IT WAS SURPRISING TO ME AND WHILE I HOPE THAT'S NOT THE CASE IT LEAVES ONE FEELING ESSENTIALLY STEAM ROLLED AT TIMES BY A PROCESS THAT MAY BE BIGGER THAN ANY RESIDENT OR TAXPAYER. PLEASE KNOW THAT WE SUPPORT THE NEED TO ENSURE PEDESTRIAN SAFETY AND SPOKE TO A NUMBER OF PROFESSIONALS TO GET INPUT ON WHETHER THIS PROJECT REPRESENTS A CRITICAL NEED AND I DIDN'T FIND ONE RESOURCE ASIDE FROM CITY ENGINEERING THAT FELT IT WAS. I SPOKE WITH A NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS, INCLUDING EILEEN TYLER, A LOCAL PLANNER AND PRESERVATION ARCHITECT WHO STATED THIS SEEMS TO BE A POLITICALLY-CHARGED ISSUE. WHAT IS THE POINT ADDRESSING A SIDEWALK ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE PROPERTY? PEDESTRIAN SAFETY SEEMS TO BE SUFFICIENTLY ADDRESSED WITH THE WALK ON THE OTHER SIDE OF ARGO, AS THAT EASILY WRAPS AROUND TO LONG SHORE. I HAVE HEARD FROM OTHERS THAT THERE ARE MUCH GREATER NEEDS THAT ADDRESS CRITICAL PEDESTRIAN SAFETY NEEDS AND THE CITY HAS THE CHALLENGING AND ENSURE THE FUNDS THERE ARE TO MANAGE THE ENORMOUS COST IN WHAT WE HAVE IN TERMS OF SIDEWALKS. IT D DOES NOT MAKE SENSE TO SHAE TO THIS BURDEN. THE SIDEWALK HAS NOT BEEN UPDATED SINCE IT WAS CREATED AND THAT THE SAFE HAS AN INITIAL MEETING SCHEDULED FOR NEXT WEEK TO DISCUSS MODIFYING THE SYSTEM. AGAIN, GIVEN THIS INFORMATION AND OUR LIMITED RESOURCES IT SEEMS RIGHT TO WAIT FOR THIS UPDATE TO BE COMPLETE AND ENABLED BETTER, MORE DATA-DRIVEN FACT-BASED DECISIONS TO BE MADE. INSTEAD OF MANDATING PROJECTS BECAUSE THERE'S CONSTRUCTION NEARBY, OR SIMPLY OUT OF CONVENIENCE. OUR REQUEST IS ALSO CONSISTENT WITH THE PRINCIPLES AND THE APPROACH THAT WERE TAKEN PLACE ON ARLINGTON BOULEVARD WHERE WE JUST RECENTLY MOVED FROM WHEN THE CONSTRUCTION WAS PUT THROUGH AT THAT TIME. I WAS TOLD BY A COUNCILMEMBER THAT THE REASON THAT THE SIDEWALKS WERE DECLINED AND PASSED ON WAS THAT THERE WAS ALREADY -- THERE WAS NEAR UNANIMOUS OPPOSITION TO THAT. THIS IS UNANIMOUS OPPOSITION.
01:07:23.361: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
01:07:23.962: >> MUCH MORE TO SAY, BUT APPRECIATE YOUR TIME.
01:07:26.198: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
01:07:31.403: >> HELLO, MY NAME IS ANDREW PICNIC. I LIVE RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET FROM MY NEIGHBOR, AND I'M SUPPORTING HIM AND HOPE THAT YOU GUYS VOTE NO ON THIS SPECIAL ASSESSMENT. SO I WELCOME THE USE OF MY SIDEWALK AS A WORK AROUND, AND DEFINITELY, THE BERKELEY HOUSE BECKLEY HOUSEIS A BEAUTIFUL HISC BUILDING AND I THINK THAT WE ADEQUATELY -- WE ADEQUATELY SUPPORT PEDESTRIANS AND WELCOME THEM ON MY SIDE. AND I THINK THE POINT OF THE -- BEING SINGLED OUT AND BEING UNANIMOUS IS VERY INTERESTING, BECAUSE I THINK ABOUT WHERE I WALK THROUGH THE NEIGHBORHOOD, INCLUDING FAIRVIEW CEMETERY. BUT, YOU KNOW, LONGSHORE AS PART OF THE WATER MAIN PROJECT, LONGSHORE WAS SET TO GET SIDEWALKS AND PAVED STREET ALL THE WAY THROUGH. AND THE CITY DECIDED TO NOT DO THAT. I THINK BECAUSE OF PUSHBACK BY THE CITIZENS. AND I THINK IT WOULD BE WRONG TO SINGLE OUT THIS CITIZEN AND FORCE THEM TO PAY FOR A SIDEWALK WHEN JUST ON THE SAME PROJECT OTHERS DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT. I FEEL LIKE IT'S UNEQUITABLE. SO THANK YOU.
01:08:49.748: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
01:09:10.335: >> MY NAME IS ED VILMETTI, I DON'T LIVE NEAR THE SUBJECT PROPERTY. I LIVE IN A NEIGHBORHOOD ACROSS TOWN THAT MOSTLY HAS SIDEWALKS BUT THAT HAS SOME SIDEWALK GAPS IN IT. AND SO, YOU KNOW, NOT EVERY DAY BUT SOME DAYS I HAVE TO WALK ON THE STREET TO GET TO WHERE I'M GOING. AND, YOU KNOW, ONE THE THINGS THAT I THINK MAKES A CITY A CITY IS THE ABILITY FOR PEDESTRIANS TO GET AROUND AND NOT HAVE TO CROSS THE STREET AND NOT HAVE TO WALK IN STREET AND NOT HAVE TO GO OUT OF THEIR WAY TO ENJOY THE STREET IN A SAFE WAY. AND, YOU KNOW, I WOULD SAY THAT, YOU KNOW, I HAVE A SIDEWALK IN FRONT OF MY HOUSE. I BOUGHT IT WHEN I BOUGHT THE HOUSE. YOU KNOW, AND I HAVE BEEN PAYING A BIT TO KEEP IT MAINTAINED SINCE THEN, PUTTING IN NEW SLABS AND WHATNOT. I DON'T THINK IT'S UNREASONABLE. WELL, WE CAN ASK THE QUESTION OF WHETHER IT'S REASONABLE FOR CITIZENS TO BE RESPONSIBLE AT ALL FOR THEIR SIDEWALKS, WHETHER THE STREETS -- THE STREET MILLAGES SHOULD PAY FOR THE SIDEWALKS RATHER THAN THE CITIZENS BEING CHARGED WITH THAT. I THINK THAT'S A DIFFERENT BIGGER QUESTION. THERE'S -- IT'S SOMEHOW RIDICULOUS THAT THE CITY WILL PAVE YOUR ROAD BUT THEY WON'T LET YOU WALK NEXT TO IT SAFELY WITHOUT SOME MONEY COMING FROM YOU FOR THAT. BUT IN THIS PARTICULAR INSTANCE, SINCE THAT'S SORT OF WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW, I'M ALL IN FAVOR OF CLOSING SIDEWALK GAPS ANYWHERE WE FIND THEM IN THE CITY, AND I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A SIDEWALK IN FRONT OF ONE SIDE OF THIS PARTICULAR PROPERTIES, THE OLDEST PHOTO I HAD OF IT WAS SINCE THE 1930s AND I DON'T THINK IT'S A BURDEN TO THE HISTORIC NATURE OF THE DWELLING TO HAVE PEDESTRIAN ACCESS TO IT. I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SEE, YOU KNOW, SYSTEMICALLY, ROUTINELY, EVERY TIME WE GET A CHANCE CLOSING SIDEWALK GAPS IN THIS TOWN. THANK YOU.
01:11:10.889: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC -- PARDON ME, IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING. SEEING NO ONE, THIS PUBLIC HEARING IS CLOSED. PUBLIC HEARING NUMBER THREE, RESOLUTION NUMBER FOUR. SCIO CHURCH IMPROVEMENTS PROJECT, CURB ANGULATER AND SIDEWALK SPECIAL ASSESSMENT DISTRICT NUMBER 52, FILE NUMBER 19-0064. IS THERE ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING? SEEING NO ONE, THIS PUBLIC HEARING IS CLOSED. PUBLIC HEARING NUMBER FOURR. E SOLUTION NUMBER 4, DHU VARREN SIDEWALK IMPROVEMENTS PROJECT SPECIAL ASSESSMENT DISTRICT 53, FILE NUMBER 19-0881. IS THIS THIN WOULD WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PU PUBLIC HEARING. PLEASE COME RIGHT UP. YOU DO ON HAVE TO RAISE YOUR HAND TO BE RECOGNIZED.
01:12:02.740: >> GOOD EVENING. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY AND THANKS FOR THE SIDEWALK. MY CONCERN IS THAT I THINK THESE ASSESSMENTS SHOULD BE BASED ON THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD USE THAT SIDEWALK RATHER THAN THE FRONTAGE OF THE PARCEL OR WHATEVER THE CRITERIA IS USED. I KNOW MY NEIGHBOR. I KNOW THAT SHE WOULD NEVER USE THE SIDEWALK AND SHE WOULD PAY THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS AND I THINK THAT'S UNFAIR. I THINK THESE ASSESSMENTS SHOULD BE BASED ON NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THAT PARTICULAR NEIGHBORHOOD. OF COURSE WE SHOULD CONTRIBUTE. WE SHOULD PAY FOR ALL OF THESE THINGS. NONOTHING IS FREE, CERTAINLY BU, PLEASE, I'M REQUESTING -- I'M ASKING THE MAYOR AND THE COUNCIL TO CONSIDER THIS ISSUE SERIOUSLY TO BE MORE FAIR TO THE TAXPAYERS. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
01:13:15.280: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
01:13:20.318: >> I DON'T REALLY -- I'M CHERYL LEISHER, 2975 SOUTH FOX RIDGE COURT AND I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT TO SAY EXCEPT TO ASK THE QUESTION, I'M SUPPOSED TO GET ASSESSED FOR $1,000 FOR THE SIDEWALK SOME OTHER PEOPLE ARE JUST GETTING ASSESSED $147. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT THE CITY DOESN'T PAY FOR. WE HAVE A PRIVATE STREET. SO WE MAINTAIN OUR STREET. IT'S NOT A CITY STREET. AND WE MAINTAIN OUR STREET LIGHTS, AND SO $1,000 ASSESSMENT FOR THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH FOX RIDGE RESIDENTS JUST SEEMS OUTRAGEOUS. AND I ONLY MAKE SOCIAL SECURITY OF $936 A MONTH. I HAVE PAID OFF MY HOUSE BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN THERE FOR 25 YEARS BUT THIS KIND OF ASSESSMENT REALLY MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE TO A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO AS MEHMET SAID. WE ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES WHO ARE GOING TO BE USING THE SIDEWALK. AND I KNOW THAT THERE'S BRAND NEW CONDOMINIUMS THAT ARE GOING FOR OVER $700,000 RIGHT ON THE CORNER OF DHU VARREN AND NIXON. OVER $700,000 FOR THESE CONDOMINIUMS BUT THEY ARE NOT PAYING FOR THE SIDEWALK. AND THE REASON THE SIDEWALK IS GOING IN IS BECAUSE OF THAT HUGE -- I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY, 3,000 CONDOMINIUMS ARE GOING IN RIGHT THERE. SO I'M PRETTY SURE SOME OF THEM MIGHT BE USING THE SIDEWALK. ANYWAY, THAT -- SO MY QUESTION IS:  WHY AM. I GOING TO HAVE TO PAY $1,000? THANK YOU.
01:15:13.798: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING? SEEING NO ONE THIS PUBLIC HEARING IS CLOSES. WE HAVE BEFORE US THE MINUTES, THE SPECIAL SESSION OF JUNE 24, AND THE REGULAR SESSION MEETING MINUTES OF JULY 1st, 2019. MAY I HAVE A MOTION TO APPROVE THE MINUTES. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER SMITH, AND SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM? DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] ALL OPPOSED? MINUTES ARE APPROVED. B1, AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND SECTIONS 1:311, 1:316, 1:317, 1:319, AND 1:324 IN CHAPTER 14 (PURCHASING, CONTRACTING AND SELLING PROCEDURE) OF TITLE I OF THE CODE OF THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM AND SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRAND. DISCUSSION OF B-1. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
01:16:04.015: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANKS, MR. MAYOR. SORRY. IF SOMEONE ELSE WANTS TO SPEAK. I PICKED UP THE CHANGES COUNCIL MADE TO THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF THIS, THE CHANGES MADE FIRST ON JUNE 17th AND THEN ON JULY 1st. I THINK THAT NOW WE HAVE ENDED UP AT A REASONABLE PLACE WITH THIS. SO WHAT WE ARE CONSIDERING TONIGHT AT SECOND READING, I THINK STRIKES THE RIGHT BALANCE. IT MAINTAINS PROPER FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY AND COUNCIL'S FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY BUT MAINTAINS A DEGREE OF FLEXIBILITY FOR STAFF NECESSARY FOR EFFICIENT DAY-TO-DAY OPERATIONS. AS YOU KNOW, I WAS NOT AT ALL COMFORTABLE WITH THE ORIGINAL VERSION PROPOSED BY CITY STAFF WHICH GRANTED THE ADMINISTRATOR BROAD AUTHORITY TO WAIVE THE CITY'S COMPETITIVE BIDDING REQUIREMENT ON ANY PURCHASE OR CONTRACT REGARDLESS OF AMOUNT. IN THE ADMINISTRATOR DECIDED COMPETITIVE BIDDING WAS NOT PRACTICAL OR OF NO VALUE TO THE CITY, END QUOTE. THE EXISTING CHARTER LANGUAGE DOESN'T ALLOW WAIVING THE COMPETITIVE BIDDING REQUIREMENT UNLESS IT'S AGREED TO BY BOTH CITY COUNCIL AND THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR. THAT JOINT SHARED AUTHORITY IS AN IMPORTANT CONTROL IN SAFEGUARD FOR TAXPAYERS. THE INITIAL PROPOSAL TO GRANT UNILATERAL AUTHORITY TO THE ADMINISTRATOR TO WAIVE COMPETITIVE BIDDING ON ANY PURCHASE WAS IN ANY MIND TOO BROAD, TOO VAGUE AND A STEP TOO FAR. COMPETITIVE BIDDING IS A FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE IN ENSURING TAX DOLLARS ARE SPENT WISELY. COMPETITIVE BIDDING HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE STANDARD, THE EXPECTATION, AND EMBEDDED IN THE CITY'S CULTURE. FORTUNATELY WITH COUNCIL'S PROVISIONS, JUNE 17th, IT WILL REMAIN THAT WAY. I WILL ADMIT THAT I DID NOT FULLY APPRECIATE THE VOLUME OF SMALL DOLLAR PURCHASES THAT ALREADY ARE SOLE SOURCED AND I AGREE THAT REQUIRING COUNCIL APPROVAL OF EACH ONE IS NOT PRACTICAL OR EFFICIENT. SO THE REVISIONS ON JULY 1st, TO WAIVE THE COMPETITIVE BIDDING REQUIREMENTS, THOSE UNDER $25,000, WAS APPROPRIATE. ESPECIALLY IN COMBINATION WITH THE NEW REQUIREMENT THAT ALL SOLE-SOURCED PURCHASES WILL BE REPORTED MONTHLY TO COUNCIL. AND IT WAS REINFORCING TO HEAR FROM ASSISTANT ADMINISTRATOR FORNIER AT THE LAST MEETING THAT HAVING PURCHASING DOLLAR THRESHOLDS IN COMBINATION WITH MONTHLY REPORTING, TO THE GOVERNING BODY WAS A GOVERNANCE BEST PRACTICE. I DO BELIEVE WE ENDED ONE A GOOD BALANCE ON THIS IMPORTANT POLICY QUESTION. SO I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS SEASON AT SECOND READING AND I WOULD LIKE TO THANK ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES FOR SPENDING THE TIME TO GET THIS RIGHT. I WAS ENCOURAGED TO GET A COUPLE OF ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION MEMBERS THAT THE CITY WOULD NOT BE SOLE SOURCING. IT TRIGGERED AND IT WAS EXACTLY THAT CONTRACT. BUT THAT THE CITY, I WAS TOLD LAST WEEK, AGAIN, FROM A COUPLE OF OUR COMMISSION MEMBERS THAT THE CITY PLANS TO ISSUE AN RFP FOR THE SERVICES AND CONDUCT A NORMAL COMPETITIVE BIDDING PROCESS. AND I CERTAINLY THINK THAT APPROPRIATE GIVEN THAT RECYCLING ANN ARBOR'S UNSOLICITED PROPOSAL IS FOR A TEN-YEAR CONTRACT WITH A LIFETIME COST OF 16 PLUS MILLION DOLLARS. SO I HOPE IT'S ACCURATE THAT WE'LL BE ISSUING AN RFP, AND I WOULD APPRECIATE IT IF STAFF WOULD SHARE THE DRAFT RFP WITH COUNCIL BEFORE IT GOES OUT. THE LAST THING WE WANT TO DO IS CONDUCT A BIDDING PROCESS THAT DOESN'T HAVE A -- A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD. SO THANK YOU, MR. LAZARUS FOR FOLLOWING UP WITH PROVIDING US THE DRAFT OF THE RFP.
01:19:51.575: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR. [CHORUS OF AYES] ALL OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. C-1, AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND THE ZONING MAP, BEING A PART OF SECTION 5:10.2 OF CHAPTER 55 OF TITLE V OF THE CODE OF ANN ARBOR, REZONING OF 0.2 ACRE FROM C1B (COMMUNITY CONVENIENCE CENTER DISTRICT) TO C1A (CAMPUS BUSINESS DISTRICT) WITH CONDITIONS, THE GARNET REZONING, 325 EAST SUMMIT STREET. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN, AND SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER. DISCUSSION OF C-1. COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
01:20:26.844: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR, AND THANK YOU TO THE MEMBERS OF COUNCIL FOR CONSIDERING THIS. I JUST WANTED TO QUICKLY SUMMARIZE SOME CONVERSATION THAT HAPPENED AT PLANNING COMMISSION WITH REGARDS TO THIS SITE. IT'S JUST UNDER A QUARTER OF AN ACRE LOCATED ON ANN ARBOR'S NORTH SIDE, JUST SOUTH OF THE BROADWAY BRIDGE. THE SITE IS CHALLENGING IN THAT IT'S ON A GRADE, SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER FROM THE STREET FRONT AT BROADWAY AND BEAKS. THE SITE IS ALSO CONTAINS CONTAMINATION OF NOTE, ORIGINALLY POLLUTED BY D.T.E., IF MY MEMORY SERVES ME CORRECTLY. THE LAND AS THE MOTION READ IS ZONED C1B AND BE ZONED TO C1A. C1A IS A CAMPUS COMMERCIAL DISTRICT, THE JUSTIFICATION FOR THIS ZONING, WHICH WAS APPROVED BY STAFF AND RECOMMENDED BY THE PLANNING COMMISSION, IS THAT IT IS WELL WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE OF U OF M CENTRAL CAMPUS AND MEDICAL CAMPUS. THE SITE ITSELF WOULD HAVE A MAXIMUM HEIGHT OF 65 FEET BUT AS YOU READ THROUGH THE STAFF REPORT, YOU WILL NOTE THAT HEIGHTS ARE REALLY 60 FEET AND 50 FEET. BUT THAT THE GRADE AND THE LOCATION OF THE SITE RELATIVE TO THE STREET MAKES THOSE HEIGHTS VERY RELATIVE AND BIZARRE TO MEASURE FROM THE STREET FRONT. AND SO THAT PEAC'S WHY THERE'S N ELEVATION LIMIT INSERTED, JUST TO MAKE IT ABSOLUTE, I SUPPOSE SEA LEVEL TO AN ELEVATION LEVEL OF MAXIMUM OF 850 FEET. AND THEN LIMITING THE MASSING, WHICH WOULD LIMIT THE -- LIMIT IT TO UNDER THE 200F.A.R. THAT WOULD BE ALLOWED BY THE ZONING. AND WHEN I SAY UNDER, I MEAN JUST UNDER BY 1%. SUBJECTS DISCUSSED BY THE PLANNING COMMISSION FOCUSED AROUND -- I SHOULD SAY FIRST RESPONSIVE TO THE ONE PIECE OF PERHAPS NEGATIVE FEEDBACK WE GOT FROM THE PUBLIC WHICH WAS AROUND UBER, LYFT AND PACKAGE DROPOFF, WHICH THAT THERE WAS NOT SUFFICIENT STAGING LOCATED, AND THEN THE REMAINDER OF PUBLIC COMMENTARY WE GOT, WE GOT IN THE FORM OF WRITING FROM NEIGHBORS WHO WROTE IN RECOMMENDING OUR -- OUR APPROVAL. OTHER TOPICS OF CONCERN WERE WITH REGARDS TO THE DISTRIBUTION OF BIKE AND CAR PARKING IN THE BELOW GRADE PARKING THAT EXISTS AND ENTERS ON TO THE ALLEY AS OPPOSED TO CURB CUTTING ON TO SUMMIT. ULTIMATELY, THE PLANNING COMMISSION VOTED TO RECOMMEND APPROVAL AND I KNOW MR. LEONARDD TO ANY QUESTIONS. AND I KNOW IT WILL BE CLEANED UP BY THE OWNER.
01:23:33.864: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
01:23:36.967: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANKS, MR. MAYOR, AND THANK YOU COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN FOR THE HELPFUL DEBRIEF ON THIS. THIS IS OBVIOUSLY FIRST READING FOR THIS, AND IN LOOKING AT THIS, I CERTAINLY CAN UNDERSTAND THE DESIRE TO MOVE TO SECOND READING TO ALLOW PUBLIC HEARING. AS I SUSPECT THERE WOULD BE NEIGHBORS AND OTHERS WHO WOULD LIKE TO VOICE THEIR OPINIONS ON THIS. BUT I WILL JUST SAY FOR NOW, FOR ME, UNLESS I'M MISSING SOMETHING BEING I'M NOT VERY LIKELY TO SUPPORT THIS ULTIMATELY. I SEE THE PETITIONER IS HERE AND PERHAPS HE MIGHT WANT TO FIELD QUESTIONS LATER. SO WHEN I READ THE STAFF REPORT, AND I SEE COMMENTS THAT SUGGEST TO ME THAT -- COMMENTS THAT SEEM TO MAKE THE CASE TO REJECT THE ZONING AND THE SITE PLAN AND I WILL TOSS OUT SOME OF THE COMMENTS. THE SURROUNDING NEIGHBORHOOD IS PRIMARILY ONE TO TWO AND A HALF STORY STRUCTURES. AND THIS, OF COURSE, IS FOUR STORIES. AND QU QUOTE AS OFFERED AT 65 FEET, A STRUCTURE ON THIS LOT WOULD BE ONE FLOOR TALLER THAN THE REST OF THE BLOCK, END QUOTE. AND QUOTE, WHEN REQUESTED BY STAFF, THE PETITIONER DECLINED TO PROVIDE MASSING DRAWINGS SHOWING THIS I. AB BUILDING, SHG THIS STRUCTURE IN RELATE TO OTHER. THIS IS A FOUR-STORY 17,000 SQUARE FOOT BUILDING ON A LOT THAT'S A BIT LESS THAN .2 OF AN ACRE AND AN AREA OF PRIMARILY ONE TO TWO AND A HALF STORIES. SO GIVEN ALL THAT, YOU WOULD THINK THAT THE DEVELOPER WOULD PROVIDE MASSING DRAWINGS, RIGHT? IT'S VERY DISAPPOINTING THAT THE DEVELOPER DID NOT AND THAT SAYS SOMETHING, NOT -- NOT POSITIVE, UNFORTUNATELY. AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT, YOU SEE THE DEFINITION OF C1A ZONING, QUOTE INTENDED PRIMARILY TO SERVE AS A NEIGHBORHOOD SHOPPING AREA, END QUOTE. WHICH, OF COURSE THIS IS NOT. AND YOU THINK, OKAY. HOW CAN ANYBODY SUPPORT THE REZONING AND THE PROPOSAL? I ALMOST COULDN'T HELP BUT CONCLUDE -- BECAUSE I THINK THE ANSWER BECOMES PRETTY CLEAR THAT THIS IS THE WHAT I TO MAXIMIZE DENSITY. SO APPARENTLY IT NO LONGER MATTERS WHETHER ZONING CLASSIFICATIONS ARE APPROPRIATE FOR A PROPOSAL OR FOR A NEIGHBORHOOD. NOR DOES IT MATTER WHAT PRECEDENT WE ARE SETTING IN A NEIGHBORHOOD OR CITYWIDE BY USING OBSCURE, -- LET'S FACE IT, IT'S AN OBSCURE ZONING CLASSIFICATION TO UP ZONE FOR DENSITY. SO I HAVE TO SAY THAT WHEN YOU SEE THIS HAPPEN PRETTY FREQUENTLY, AND IT'S HAPPENING MORE AND MORE AND MORE, IT'S HARD NOT TO CONCLUDE -- I'M SORRY TO SAY THAT OUR STAFF AND OUR PLANNING COMMISSION HAVE NOW OFFICIALLY DEFINED THE RULES OF DEVELOPMENT GAME IN ANN ARBOR'S DENSITY, TRUMPS EVERYTHING. BUT I WILL SAY THAT RULE DOESN'T WORK FOR ME. AND SO BEFORE I EVER THINK OF SUPPORTING THIS, I NEED TO SEE THE MASSING DRAWINGS TO KNOW WHAT THE FOLKS WILL BE LIVING IN FOR YEARS TO COME. I DON'T THINK THAT'S AN UNREALISTIC THING TO REQUEST. SO I'M INTERESTED IN OTHERS VIEWS BUT MY SENSE ON THIS, OBVIOUSLY, IS THAT THIS IS THE WRONG ZONING AND THE WRONG SITE PLAN FOR THIS PROPERTY. AND IF IT WAS COUNCIL'S PLEASURE TO TAKE THIS TO SECOND READING TO OBTAIN MORE PUBLIC INPUT, I'M CERTAINLY OKAY WITH THAT. THIS IS A PROJECT USING AN OBSCURE, INAPPROPRIATE ZONING CLASSIFICATION FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF MORE DENSITY. AND A PROJECT THAT IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE SURROUNDING AREA. AND WE'RE DOING ALL OF THAT FOR TEN CONDOMINIUM UNITS. JUST THINK ABOUT THAT ONE. THANKS.
01:27:37.174: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
01:27:38.041: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR AND THANK YOU COUNCILMEMBER LUMM FOR ONCE AGAIN SUGGESTING THE VERY THINGS I WAS GOING TO SAY. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY -- I DO UNDERSTAND WHERE THIS IS COMING FROM. THIS -- WE LET THE C1A R CREEP IN ON THE LOWER TOWN SITE AND WITH GREAT PROMISES THAT IT WOULD GET OUT OF HAND AND THEN, OF COURSE, LAST MEETING, WE APPROVED A QUITE LARGE STRUCTURE IN AN AREA PLAN FORM FOR THE DTE SITE. AND WHILE ALL OF THESE THINGS MAY -- MAY SEEM -- AND THE I CENTER BUILDING MAY MAKE IT SEEM APPROPRIATE AND MAYBE EVEN SMALL TO MAKE IT FOUR STORIES HERE, IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT'S RIGHT AND IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE ARE USING THE RIGHT KIND OF ZONING AND IT DOESN'T REALLY MEAN THAT WE ARE BEING GENUINE TO OUR MASTER PLAN, AND TO THAT AREA, ESPECIALLY. AND SO I GUESS MY QUESTION FOR THE PETITIONER WOULD BE, WHAT TYPE OF STRUCTURE WOULD BE BUILT WITHOUT THESE -- WITHOUT THIS RESTRICTED OVERSIZED ZONING? AND I NO H KNOW THAT THERE WAS A CIRCULATION THAT WENT AROUND THIS MORNING THAT OTHER RESIDENTS COULD WE HAVE BEFORE US, A MAP OF WHAT PLANNING STAFF CONSIDERS APPROPRIATE, NEAR CAMPUS AREAS? IS IT THE ENTIRE CITY? DOES THE OLD WEST SIDE COUNT NOW BECAUSE OF THE ARGUS BUILDING IS OVER THERE? DOES NORTH AND EAST MEDICAL CAMPUSES COUNT? CAN WE HAVE NO HEIGHT LIMIT BUILDINGS GOING UP OUT ON PLYMOUTH BECAUSE THE PURCHASE OF THE PROPERTIES UP THERE? AND SO AS -- WE KNOW WHERE -- THE CITY IS INTEGRATED WITH THE UNIVERSITY IN A VERY INVOLVED WAY. BUT, YOU KNOW, JUST WHAT DOES DEFINE NEAR CAMPUS? I NEVER CONSIDERED THIS NEAR CAMPUS. I LIVE VERY CLOSE TO THIS LOCATION, AND I CONSIDERED IT NEAR DOWNTOWN. IF ANYTHING, D2 WOULD BE THE TYPE OF THING THAT WOULD FLOW DOWN THE HILL TO THIS AND EVEN THAT IS OBVIOUSLY TOO BIG AND I THINK I EXPRESSED THAT LAST WEEK WHEN WE DISCUSSED THE D.T.E. SITE. SO I QUESTION THE NEED FOR THIS RESTRICTED OVERSIZED ZONING. I THINK WE SHOULD STICK TO WHAT WE HAVE. WE'RE GOING THROUGH THE MASTER PLAN. I'M SURE THE PRO DENSITY FOLKS WILL HAVE THEIR SAY, BUT UNTIL THAT DAY, IT'S INCUMBENT ON COUNCIL TO MAKE THESE DECISIONS AND TO ENFORCE THE LAW AS IT STANDS. NOT TO MAKE UP LAW AS WE GO ALONG. AND I WOULD CONSIDER THIS A SPOT ZONING, WHICH WAS, YOU KNOW, THE SPOT -- THE WHOLE IDEA OF SPOT ZONING, WAS SHOSHOUTED DOWN YEARS AGO, A HANDFUL OF YEARS AGO AND NOW IT'S BECOME OUR HABIT. AND I SUGGEST IT'S THE WRONG HABIT FOR US. SO I -- I -- AS COUNCILWOMAN LUMM SAID, I'M ALWAYS HAPPY TO HAVE A PUBLIC HEARING AND MOVE IT FORWARD BUT I DON'T SUPPORT IT TONIGHT AND I'M NOT LIKELY TO SUPPORT IT NEXT WEEK EITHER. SO I APPRECIATE YOU TAKING SOME TIME TO LISTEN AND I KNOW OTHERS MIGHT HAVE QUESTIONS FOR THE PETITIONER AND MY QUESTION WOULD BE, WHAT TYPE OF BUILDING WOULD GO THERE UNDER THE EXISTING ZONING? WHY THE REQUEST FOR A SHOPPING AREA THAT'S GOING TO BE TEN CONDOS. THERE'S NO SHOPPING. WE NEED SHOPPING. IF THEY WERE PUTTING THIS IN AND THEY WERE SAYING IT WAS SHOPPING, I WOULD SAY, WELL, THAT'S PROPRIETOR USE BUT IT'S SIMPLY INAPPROPRIATE ON ITS FACE.
01:31:13.290: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND AND THEN NELSON.
01:31:16.293: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS AT FIRST READING THIS EVENING. I THINK WHEN I LOOK AT THE SURROUNDING AREA, I SEE A MIX OF BUILDING TYPES AND USES AND SO FEEL THAT FOUR STORIES IS NOT INAPPROPRIATE GIVEN THAT THIS BASICALLY IS AT AN INTERSECTION OF A NUMBER OF STREETS. I ALSO JUST, Y YOU KNOW, TAKE ISSUE WITH THIS -- WITH THIS KIND OIFICATION OF DENSITY AS IF IT SOMEHOW JUST A NEGATIVE. TO ME, THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF MISSING MIDDLE HOUSING THAT I WANT TO ENCOURAGE THAT TYPE OF CREATIVITY AND TRYING TO GET DIFFERENT KINDS OF HOUSING NEAR OUR DOWNTOWN. YOU KNOW, AS WE SAID, IT IS JUST TEN UNITS. SO THIS DOESN'T STRIKE ME AS A -- YOU KNOW, AS A TOWERING BUILDING THAT'S INTRUSIVE TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD. WHEN I LOOK AT MAPPING AND PULL UP A MAP, I SEE DIFFERENT PEAKS AND SOME LOWER KINDS OF HOUSING AND SOME TALLER KINDS OF HOUSING AND OTHER KINDS OF BUILDINGS AND SO TO ME, I THINK THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE USE FOR THE NEIGHBORHOOD, FOR THE CONTEXT FOR THE SURROUNDING AREA AND I WILL BE PLEASED TO SUPPORT IT GOING THROUGH TO SECOND READING.
01:32:49.486: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
01:32:50.353: >> Councilmember Nelson: THANK YOU, MAYOR TAYLOR. I ALSO PLAN TO SUPPORT THIS DEVELOPMENT. I'M SYMPATHETIC TO THE CONCERNS OF PEOPLE AT THIS TABLE ABOUT BENDING THE RULES AND SPOT ZONING AND MAKING EXCEPTIONS IN A LOT OF PLACES THAT WE COULD BE JUST FOLLOWING THE RULES, BUT IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE, I'M JUST LOOKING AT THE SIZE AND THE SCALE OF IT, AND I'M SYMPATHETIC TO ARGUMENTS ABOUT IT BEING A HALF MILE WALK AWAY FROM WHAT WAS THE NURSING SCHOOL. I THINK IT WAS A HALF MILE AWAY. AND WHEN I LOOK AT THE MAP, I DO SEE WHERE IT'S ACCESSIBLE TO A LOT OF PLACES AND WE LEGIT LEGITIMATELY HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WANT TO LIVE HERE. IT DOESN'T FEEL HUGE RELATIVE TO WHAT'S AROUND IT. AND WE TALK ABOUT -- WE ARE REVISITING OUR MASTER PLAN AND YES, IT'S TRUE WE CAN REVISIT A LOT OF THESE ZONING DECISIONS, BUT I'M JUST NOT -- I'M NOT OVERLY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS ONE DECISION HAVING A HUGE IMPACT PUSHING A SNOWBALL DOWN THE HILL AND CAUSING A DOMINO EFFECT OF A LOT OF OTHER THINGS THAT WE DON'T WANT. SO I PLAN TO SUPPORT THIS PROJECT. THANK YOU.
01:34:04.561: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
01:34:05.762: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. AND THANKS FOR THE CONVERSATION TO COLLEAGUES. I TOO WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS AS I DID AT PLANNING COMMISSION. I GUESS I WANT TO POINT OUT A FEW THINGS. I THINK THE GRADE OF THE SITE GIVES A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY TO HIDE MUCH OF THE HEIGHT AND THE MASSING. AND I THINK TOO THAT AS YOU LOOK IN THE DISTRICT -- AND THIS IS INCLUDED IN THE STAFF REPORT AND COUNCILMEMBER GRAND ALLUDED TO THIS, THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST DIVERSE AREAS BY BUILDING HEIGHTS, TYPES, USES. WE LOOK AT THE IMMEDIATE AREA. WE HAVE THE FLATIRON, WHICH IS, YOU KNOW, A SIMILAR MODERN CONSTRUCTION THAT MAKES HOMAGE TO, LIKE THE RED BRICK OF OLD GERMAN ANN ARBOR, THREE STORIES TALL JUST AROUND THE CORNER. WE HAVE ACTUALLY THE OLD BREWERY WHICH IS AN 1860 BREWERY, YOU KNOW, HALF PAY BLOCK DOWN, WHICH IS THREE AND A HALF STORIES. BEAUTIFUL. AND I THINK WHAT THIS PRESENTS IS AN OPPORTUNITY, IS TO SHOW MODERN ARCHITECTURE AND PROGRESS, YOU KNOW, JUXTAPOSED TO THAT TRULY OLD HISTORY, CAREYTOWN. I THINK TOO, YOU KNOW, OF ST. THOMAS, YOU KNOW, A BLOCK AWAY OF THIS MASSIVE AND BEAUTIFUL BUILDING AND SOME NOT AS BEAUTIFUL MODERN ADDITIONS OF SIMILAR OR GREATER SCALE. AND THIS WHOLE AREA IS AN EEL ECLECTIC MIX, AND I THINK DISMISSING THE IMPACT THAT THE HOUSING HAS ON OUR MARKET IS NOT ENTIRELY FAIR. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT ADDING TEN CONDOMINIUMS TO THE CITY'S HOUSING MARKET, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT TEN HOUSES IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS THAT AREN'T VYING FOR THE SAME INCOME PA BRACKET F BUYER AND THAT MAKES A MEANINGFUL DIFFERENCE WHEN IT TALKS ABOUT OUR AVERAGE HOUSE SALE PRICE GOING UP AND UP AND UP, CREEPING ABOVE $350,000. AND THAT'S MEANINGFUL, RIGHT? THAT'S TEN HOUSES IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS THAT WE LOVE, THAT, YOU KNOW -- I'M NOT GOING TO GUARANTEE, BUT, YOU NO KNOW, HAVE GREATER OPPORTUNITY TO -- TO GO TO -- THEY ARE NOT THE WEALTHIEST OF THE WEALTHY. I WILL LEAVE IT AT THAT. THAT'S MY PERSONAL OPINION AND I WILL BE GLAD TO SUPPORT THIS TONIGHT IN THE SECOND READING IF IT GETS THERE.
01:36:38.181: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
01:36:39.416: >> Councilmember Eaton: THANK YOU. I DON'T REALLY OBJECT TO THE PARTICULAR BUILDING THAT'S BEING PROPOSED, BUT I DO OBJECT TO THE ZONING CLASSIFICATION THAT'S BEING SOUGHT. I BELIEVE THAT WE ARE SETTING A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT WHEN WE EXTEND THE CAMPUS BUSINESS DISTRICT TO AREAS THAT IT WAS NOT INTENDED TO APPLY TO. THE CAMPUS BUSINESS DISTRICT IS INTENDED PRIMARILY TO SERVE AS A NEIGHBORHOOD SHOPPING AREA FOR THE UNIVERSITY-ORIENTED POPULATION THAT IS CONCENTRATED AROUND IT. THAT'S FROM THE -- OUR ORDINANCE. THESE DISTRICTS SHALL BE LOCATED IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE CENTRAL AREA OF THE CITY. NEITHER ONE OF THOSE IS TRUE ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR PROPERTY. REZONING DECISIONS ARE SUBJECT TO A DUE PROCESS ANALYSIS BY THE COURT. WHILE THIS PARTICULAR REZONING HAS CONDITIONS ATTACHED TO IT, WE CAN'T REQUIRE CONDITIONS. SO IF A NEIGHBORING PROPERTY REQUESTS C1A ZONING WITH THE UNLIMITED HEIGHT, WE WOULD BE HARD PRESSED TO FIGHT THE LITIGATION THAT WOULD FOLLOW A DENIAL. WE CAN'T REQUIRE THE CONDITIONS THAT ARE ATTACHING TO THIS REQUEST. HWE CAN'T APPLY THAT TO OTHER REQUESTS FOR REZONING UNDER THIS ZONING DISTRICT. THIS DEFINITION OF THE CAMPUS BUSINESS DISTRICT IS REALLY SOUTH UNIVERSITY OR SOUTH STATE STREET, TUCKED INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE CITY, IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE CENTRAL CAMPUS. AND TO EXTEND IT THIS FAR NORTH INTO THE NORTH SIDE OF THE CITY, IS A MISUSE THIS CLASSIFICATION AND IT SETS A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT, I BELIEVE. WE SHOULDN'T BE IN A WILLY-NILLY FASHION SPOT ZONING ONE PARCEL AT A TIME THROUGHOUT THE CITY. WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT OUR D1 AND D2 ZONING DISTRICTS ARE WHERE WE WANT DENSITY AND HEIGHT. THE D2 ZONING DISTRICT IS A BUFFER ZONE FROM THE CORE DENSITY TO THE NEARBY NEIGHBORHOODS. USING THIS ZONING DISTRICT OUTSIDE OF THOSE AREAS, ALLOWS UNLIMITED HEIGHT BEYOND THOSE BUFFER AREAS THAT WE HAVE ESTABLISHED TO PROTECT NEIGHBORHOODS. THIS JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME. I WILL BE VOTING AGAINST IT TONIGHT, AND I WILL LIKELY BE VOTING AGAINST IT IF IT COMES BACK FOR A SECOND READING. THANK YOU.
01:39:36.025: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND AND GRISWOLD AND THEN WE CAN MOVE ON SINCE IT'S FIRST READING.
01:39:41.998: >> Councilmember Grand: SURE. I WANTED TO ASK OUR CITY ATTORNEY TO CLARIFY SOME POINTS IF HE'S ABLE TO, BASED ON COUNCILMEMBER EATON'S ASSERTATION IF WE WERE TO PROVIDE THIS TYPE OF ZONING WHICH I UNDERSTAND HAS A NUMBER OF CONDITIONS THAT LIMIT THE HEIGHT, THAT NEIGHBORHOOD PROPERTIES WOULD BE ABLE TO SUE US AND THEN GET THE SAME ZONING FOR UNLIMITED HEIGHT THAT STRIKES ME AS UNLIKELY BUT I'M NOT AN ATTORNEY. SO I THOUGHT I WOULD ASK OURS.
01:40:11.227: >> City Atty. Postema: YES, AND MR. McDONALD WILL LOOK AT THAT. HE REVIEWED THAT ISSUE AND HE WILL PREPARE SOMETHING FOR THE COUNCIL. HE'S REVIEWING THAT ISSUE BECAUSE IT'S BEEN RAISED. I'M NOT PREPARED TO TALK ABOUT IT TONIGHT AND NOR WOULD I ORDINARILY DO SO UNDER A QUESTION WITHOUT LOOKING AT IT FURTHER.
01:40:26.910: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU.
01:40:27.710: >> City Atty. Postema: I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION.
01:40:30.046: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
01:40:31.147: >> Councilmember Griswold: THIS WAS DISCUSSED LAST NIGHT AT CAUCUS. I SUPPORT THE DENSITY. I SUPPORT THE BUILDING, BUT I DO NOT SUPPORT C1A ZONING. I'M A RELATIVELY NEW COUNCILMEMBER, AND I HAVE SPENT MANY HOURS IN CLOSED SESSIONS AND I FEEL LIKE I GOT ON COUNCIL AND THERE WAS A MESS THAT WE ARE NOW EXPECTED TO CLEAN UP AND ONE OF THOSE IS THE COTTAGES OF BARTON. AND ALL OF THAT FOLLOWS THE THEME THAT ANN ARBOR IS A VERY FORTUNATE COMMUNITY. WE ARE A WEALTHY COMMUNITY. SO WE MAKE MANY OF OUR DECISIONS HERE AT THE TABLE BASED ON WISHFUL THINKING. WE ARE NOT DISCIPLINED BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE TO BE. WE HAVE RESOURCES TO BE A BIT SLOPPY. AND FOR US, TO APPROVE C1A ZONING, IS CREATING AN UNACCEPTABLE RISK FOR THIS COMMUNITY AND THERE HAS TO BE ANOTHER ZONING CLASS THAT WOULD WORK FOR THIS BUILDING. THAT'S WHAT I ASKED FOR LAST NIGHT AND THAT'S WHAT I'M ASKING FOR NOW. IF WE CAN'T GET CLARIFICATION REGARDING WHAT THE HEIGHT LIMITS WOULD BE, THEN I THINK WE SHOULD POSTPONE IT UNTIL WE HAVE ALL OF THE INFORMATION.
01:41:54.764: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
01:41:55.598: >> Councilmember Lumm: I HAVE A FOLLOW-UP QUESTION FOR YOU MR. POSTEMA. SO FOLLOWING UP ON COUNCILMEMBER GRAND'S QUESTION ABOUT THE PROTECTIONS AFFORDED SURROUNDING PROPERTIES IN THIS PROPOSED ZONING DISTRICT, FOR THIS PROPERTY, THIS .2 OF AN ACRE PROPERTY, COUNCIL HAD RECEIVED A LETTER FROM SUSAN FREELANDER ABOUT THIS VERY QUESTION, THIS RELATED TO THE BROADWAY REZONING BACK IN NOVEMBER OF 2017. I CAN'T RECALL, WAS THAT LETTER CONFIDENTIAL? BECAUSE IF NOT, SHE ANSWERS THAT QUESTION IN THAT LETTER TO COUNCIL.
01:42:48.985: >> City Atty. Postema: SHE MAY ANSWER THAT LETTER -- SHE MAY ANSWER THAT LETTER TO THE COUNCIL, BUT SHE'S NOT THE CITY ATTORNEY.
01:42:56.693: >> Councilmember Lumm: RIGHT BUT SHE'S THE EXPERT, THE PERSON WHO IS BROUGHT IN TO OWE WINE AND ADVISE ON QUESTIONS LIKE THIS FOR -- OPINE ON QUESTIONS LIKE THIS FOR --
01:43:08.938: >> City Atty. Postema: THAT'S INCORRECT. FREELANDER IS AN ATTORNEY WOULD WE WORK WITH ON THE OTHER SIDE BUT SHE'S OPPOSED TO THE CITY AND SHE DOESN'T PROVIDE ADVICE TO THE CITY.
01:43:19.716: >> Councilmember Lumm: WELL WE HAVE UTILIZED HER IN THE PAST, BUT I WON'T -- WE WON'T, YEAH, HAVE THIS DISCUSSION HERE TONIGHT, OBVIOUSLY. I WILL JUST SAY THAT EXPERT OPINION, OTHER OUTSIDE EXPERT OPINION HAS BEEN PROVIDED US ON THIS QUESTION AND I THINK THE REQUEST HE -- THE CONCERN IS RAISED BECAUSE WHERE THIS IS BEING PROPOSED, IS THE C1A ZONING, IT HE ESSENTIALLY WOULD BE -- I MEAN, IT PERMITS MORE INTENSE DEVELOPMENT THAN D2. SO HENCE THE REQUEST THAT WAS MADE EARLIER FOR A MAP, I THINK THIS WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL TO THE CITY. I KNOW I WOULD FIND IT HELPFUL TO HAVE HAVE A MAP FOR THE AREAS THAT THE CITY USED AS POSSIBLE CANDIDATES FOR THIS ZONING DESIGNATION. I KNOW WE HAVE APPARENTLY 22 PROPERTIES NOW THAT ARE ZONED IN THIS FASHION, AS COUNCILMEMBER EATON SAID. IT'S REALLY, YOU KNOW, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT SOUTH U, AND AREAS, YOU KNOW, AROUND STATE STREET, SOUTH STATE, PRIMARILY, AND -- BUT TO HAVE ABETTER UNDERSTANDING SO WE CAN UNDERSTAND, YOU KNOW, WHAT IS BEING ENVISIONED IN TERMS OF HOW THIS -- THESE ZONING CLASSIFICATIONS COULD BE FORCE FIT. THAT'S WHAT WE ARE DOING HERE. IT IS FORCE FIT AROUND OTHER AREAS OF TOWN WOULD BE HELPFUL.
01:44:49.872: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
01:44:55.845: >> Councilmember Griswold: NO.
01:45:02.919: >> Councilmember Lumm: NO.

01:45:26.142: >> Mayor Taylor: C2. AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND CHAPTER 55 (UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE), ZONING OF 1.19 ACRES FROM TWP (TOWNSHIP DISTRICT) TO R1A (SINGLE-FAMILY DWELLING DISTRICT), 2705 NEWPORT ROAD. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER SMITH, SECONDED BY COU COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI. DISCUSSION OF C-2? CALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] ALL OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. C3, AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND SECTIONS 5.15 (TABLE 5-15), 5.17.3, 5.17.5 (TABLE 5:17-5), AND SECTION 5.37.2 OF CHAPTER 55 (UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE) OF TITLE V OF THE CODE OF THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR (PERMITTED USE TABLE, PARKLAND DONATIONS, DIMENSIONAL STANDARDS TABLE, FRONT LOT LINE). MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER SMITH. SECONDEDBY GRISWOLD. DISCUSSION OF C-3. COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
01:46:22.665: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I HAVE ONE QUICK QUESTION OF STAFF. MY UNDERSTANDING FROM READING OUR PACKET IS THAT THESE WERE ERRORS THAT WERE SPOTTED IN THE CODE. I WAS CURIOUS HOW THEY WERE SPOTTED, HOW THEY WERE IDENTIFIED.
01:46:39.849: >> GOOD EVENING MAYOR AND CENTER, I'M BRETT LINARD. WE WERE COMMITTED TO IF WE IDENTIFIED ANY ERRORS IN THE CODE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CORRECTED THEM IN A QUICK BASIS. THESE ARE STRICTLY CORRECTIONS THAT WE NOTICED IN THE CONTEXT OF FREQUENT USE OF THE CODE AND ANSWERING QUESTIONS REGARDING THE CODE. IT DIDN'T ARISE OUT OF ANY PARTICULAR PERMITS OR PETITIONS.
01:47:07.710: >> Councilmember Nelson:  OH, OKAY. YOU ARE GOING THROUGH THE CODE IN A METHODICAL WAY OR YOU STUMBLED UPON IT?
01:47:15.051: >> YOU KNOW, I WOULD HAVE TO DEFER TO MY STAFF. THESE ACCUMULATED OVER TIME BY STAFF AS WE ARE ANSWERING QUESTIONS AND COMPARING THEM WITH THE PREVIOUS OR NANCE TO MAKE SURE -- ORDINANCE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE UP TO DATE. I CAN ANSWER WE DO NOT HAVE -- WE ARE NOT GOING THROUGH THIS IN A SYSTEMIC WAY ON A PAGE-BY-PAGE BASIS. THEY TEND TO ARISE FROM ANSWERING QUESTIONS, WE NOTICE THAT IT'S INCONSISTENT WITH WHAT THE PREVIOUS CODE WAS AND WE MOVE TO CORRECT IT.
01:47:40.843: >> Councilmember Nelson: OKAY. THANK YOU. I SHOULD APOLOGIZE. THIS WAS A QUESTION I SHOULD HAVE COMMITTED TO THE AGENDA LAST WEEK. I WAS CAUGHT UP IN FAMILY STUFF. THANKS.
01:47:52.855: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
01:47:53.789: >> Councilmember Ackerman: IF YOU WOULDN'T GO TOO FAR. BECAUSE THE UDC WAS PASSED AND APPROVED BY PRIOR COUNCIL, AND I THINK IT'S A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO REMIND FOLKS OF PROCESS OF HOW WE GOT TO NEW CHAPTER 55, THE UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE. THIS IS A TEN-PLUS YEAR PROCESS IN WHICH OUR OLD ORDINANCE WAS REWRITTEN AND SIMPLIFIED AND CLARIFIED AND REORGANIZED INTO A MUCH MORE MODERN AND LESS COMPLICATED VERSION. THERE WERE SEVERAL ROUNDS OF REVISIONS, SOME SYSTEMIC, DONE BY ST STAFFING CONSULTANT. AND SOME FOUND BY THE RESIDENTS IN THE LEAD UP TO THE APPROVAL THROUGH A LONG PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT PROCESS. AND THEN NOW AS I UNDERSTAND STAFF IS LOOKING THROUGH SOME PROPOSALS, EVEN USING BOTH THE UDC AND THE OLD CODE OR AT LEAST YOU WERE PREVIOUSLY TO MAKE SURE THAT AS THE UDC IS BEING APPLIED TO REAL WORLD EXAMPLES, WHERE IT AFFECTS THE COMMUNITY, THAT WE HAVE THAT DOUBLE CHECKED TO THE OLD VERSION. SO A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS IN WHICH THESE REVISIONS HAVE BEEN CAUGHT, SOME BEFORE THE PASSAGE. UCD DC, BUT MAKING SURE WE CORRT IT BEFORE IT AFFECTS ANY REAL WORLD PROPOSALS.
01:49:11.400: >> THAT'S CORRECT AND I WOULD JUST ADD ON, THAT'S AN ACCURATE SUMMARY OF HOW THAT EVOLUTION HAPPENED. WE ALSO WERE CAREFUL TO USE BOTH CODES, ACTUALLY LEADING UP TO ADOPTION. SO WE HAVE THAT EXPERIENCE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ADOPTION.
01:49:26.515: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
01:49:29.752: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU. OKAY. SO FOR CATCHING THESE KIND OF THINGS AND BRINGING THESE AMENDMENTS FORWARD, SO MY APPRECIATION FOR, YOU KNOW, MOVING FROM CHAPTER 55, WHICH A LOT OF US WERE, YOU KNOW, ACCUSTOMED TO USING AND VERY FAMILIAR WITH TO THE UDC, IS THAT -- AND THIS MIGHT BE VERY DIFFICULT TO CREATE THIS ADDED TOOL. IS THAT WITH CHAPTER 55, IF YOU WERE LOOKING FOR WHATEVER, THERE WAS A SEARCH BAR BOX AND YOU JUST TYPE IN WHAT IT WAS THAT YOU WERE LOOKING FOR AND IT WOULD BRING UP THAT PART OF CHAPTER 55. SO UDC, WE DON'T HAVE THAT. I WILL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE. THERE'S SOME PROPERTY BEING REDEVELOPED IN THE SECOND WARD AND THEY HAD QUESTIONS ABOUT WHERE -- WHAT THE REQUIREMENT IS AND SINGLE FAMILY ZONING, WHERE YOU LOCATE, YEAH, ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT AND OTHER THINGS AROUND THE PERIMETER OF THE PROPERTY. OKAY. CHAPTER 55, I COULD FIND IT AND UDC I COULD ONLY FIND THE LANGUAGE ABOUT WHERE TO STORE RECYCLING CONTAINERS AND GARBAGE CANS. SO I DON'T KNOW IF WE JUST INADVERTENTLY DROPPED THAT, BUT, AGAIN IF THIS WAS A WAY TO SEARCH FOR SPECIFIC THINGS, ANYTHING. IT WOULD BE HELPFUL.
01:50:54.770: >> ALL GREAT QUESTIONS. WE -- WE'RE STILL EVALUATING THE BEST INTEGRATION TO IT IN OTHER CITY CODES. THIS IS QUITE A DIFFERENT FORMAT. THIS IS THE FIRST ONE THAT IS INDEXED AND FULL TABLE OF CONTENT.
01:51:13.355: >> Councilmember Lumm: BUT IT'S SO MUCH HARDER. I KNOW.
01:51:14.957: >> ON TOP OF THAT, IT IS AVAILABLE DIGITALLY, IT'S FULLY SEARCHABLE AS JUST A SIMPLE P.D.F. DOCUMENT. SO IF YOU ARE OR ANY OF WHY CONSTITUENTS HAVE QUESTIONS, THAT'S HOW I USE IT. I FIND IT ACTUALLY QUITE MORE EFFECTIVE BECAUSE IT IS A MUCH MORE SIMPLE AND SORT OF COMMON INTERFACE.
01:51:34.977: >> Councilmember Lumm: OKAY.
01:51:35.611: >> SO IN SHORT, ALWAYS FEEL FREE TO REFER PEOPLE.
01:51:39.014: >> Councilmember Lumm: BUT COULD I HASSLE YOU. BEFORE IT WAS SEVERAL SERVE.
01:51:43.853: >> MM-HMM.
01:51:44.153: >> Councilmember Lumm: I SENT THE PDF OUT TO PEOPLE AN I DOWNLOADED AND LOOKED THROUGH THE PDF AND I SAID CHART Xs ON THIS PAGE. STILL, THOUGH, FOR VERY SPECIFIC THINGS WITHOUT A SEARCH, YOU KNOW, WINDOW, IT'S -- IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO FIND, EVEN GOING THROUGH THE TABLE OF CONTENTS, LOOKING AT ALL OF THESE CHARTS. IF DOWN THE ROAD IF IT WERE --
01:52:07.009: >> WE'RE ALWAYS LOOKING TO IMPROVE IT.
01:52:09.144: >> Councilmember Lumm: POSSIBLE TO LOOK AT A WAY TO MAKE IT -- THAT A BIT MORE USER FRIENDLY OR EVERYONE SO WE DON'T HAVE TO, YOU KNOW, CONSULT YOU, FOR EXAMPLE. WE COULD JUST DIRECTLY HELP PEOPLE. AND THEY CAN HELP THEMSELVES. I THINK THAT WOULD BE AWFULLY NICE.
01:52:25.394: >> ABSOLUTELY AND THERE'S A LOT OF LINKS IN THERE THAT CROSS REFERENCE. I THINK THIS' A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND THAT WITH SOME SUBSECTIONS THAT WE HAVEN'T TAKEN TO THE NEXT LEVEL. WE ALSO HEARD FEEDBACK TO THE CONTRARY OF THAT, HOW MUCH PEOPLE APPRECIATE WITHIN THAT SINGLE DOCUMENT. IT'S NOT ONLY CHAPTER 55. WE INTEGRATED DIFFERENT TEN DIFFERENT CHAPTERS. BUT IN SHORT, I HEAR THE MESSAGE.
01:52:48.450: >> Councilmember Lumm: THE SEARCH ENGINE.
01:52:49.385: >> I THINK MORE ACCESSIBILITY, THE BETTER IT WILL BE FOR ALL OF US.
01:52:52.554: >> Councilmember Lumm: YEAH.
01:52:55.157: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR. [CHORUS OF AYES] ALL OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. DC1 ARE E SOLUTION TO APPROVE AN ADDENDUM TO COUNCIL ADMINISTRATIVE RULES, RULE 3, REIMBURSEMENT OF COUNCIL EXPENSES. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER. DISCUSSION OF DC-1. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
01:53:19.381: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU. I APPRI APPRECIATE THE ADMINISTR LOOKING AFTER OUR EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND PUTTING THIS IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. I HAVE A -- KIND OF A PERSONAL CONCERN ABOUT IT BECAUSE I KNOW THAT WE HAVE HAD INSTANCES -- NOT WE, BUT THERE HAVE BEEN IN MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT, INSTANCES IN THE PAST, WHERE THERE'S BEEN CONCERNS ABOUT THE REIMBURSEMENT PROCESS AN THINGS LIKE THAT AND WE ALSO HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT US GETTING A SALARY INCREASE TONIGHT AND SO THIS IS SORT OF MORE OF THAT. AND SO I HAVE BEEN DOING SOME SSOUL SEARCHING. I'M NOT SURE I WANT TO BE PUTTING MYSELF IN A SITUATION WHERE I TAKE MORE MONEY FROM THE CITY. I HAVE CONCERNS THAT THIS WILL GIVE US SITUATIONS WHERE PEOPLE WILL EXPRESS THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT TRANSPARENCY ABOUT HOW WE MAY BE SPENDING THIS $500 THAT WE ARE GRANTED EACH YEAR HERE. AND I'M JUST -- I'M NOT SURE HOW THAT'S GOING TO WORK OUT FOR US. JUST IT SEEMS LIKE A POTENTIAL PITFALL REGARDLESS OF HOW FIES TIDDOUS OUR BOOKKEEPING S. I WANTED TO GO AHEAD AND SHARE THAT. PERHAPS THE FOLKS ON RULES OR ADMIN COULD ELUCIDATE.
01:54:37.893: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER NELSON?
01:54:39.361: >> Councilmember Nelson: WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT THIS AT RULES, THE -- I THINK MOST OF MY CONTRIBUTION TO THE CONVERSATION WAS JUST SORT OF TRYING TO PONDER WHAT I COULD POSSIBLY SUBMIT TO BE REIMBURSED FOR -- OR WHAT OTHER PEOPLE COULD POSSIBLY SUBMIT AS REIMBURSABLE AND INSOFAR AS I WAS LOOKING AT THIS ISSUE A A HELP TO PEOPLE WHO MAYBE DIDN'T -- DIDN'T HAVE A SPARE MONEY TO THROW AT THINGS, RELATED TO CITY BUSINESS, THAT SEEMED LIKE A HELPFUL THING. BUT I THINK GOING TO YOUR POINT, COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, I WOULD BE CURIOUS WHAT OUR CITY ADMINISTRATOR HAD IN MIND IN TERMS OF TRANSPARENCY AND IN TERMS OF REPORTING AND IN TERMS OF -- LIKE I SAY, I COULDN'T QUITE -- I CAN'T QUITE FATHOM WHAT I WOULD USE THIS FOR BUT IF OTHERS WANTED TO USE IT, I THINK THERE SHOULD BE A MECHANISM FOR TRANSPARENCY. THAT WOULD BE MY QUESTION.
01:55:41.824: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. LAZARUS?
01:55:42.458: >> City Admin. Lazarus: COUNCILO SEPARATE ITEMS AND I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS BOTH OF THEM. THE FIRST IS WE WENT AND LISTENING TO COUNCIL CONCERNS ABOUT MISCELLANEOUS COSTS, AND ALSO THE ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES THAT WOULD IMPROVE THEIR EFFICIENCIES AS COUNCILMEMBERS, THERE'S REALLY NO WAY TO DO THAT. SO WE SET SOME FUNDING, A MODEST AMOUNT OF FUNDING IN THE BUDGET TO FACILITATE THAT BECAUSE IF IT'S CITY-RELATED BUSINESS, CERTAINLY THERE SHOULD BE A WAY FOR THE CITY TO SUPPORT YOU IN DOING THAT. AND THAT IS A BU BUDGETARY ISSUE SEPARATE AND APART FROM THE RULES. IF YOU CHOOSE NOT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT'S BEEN MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU, BECAUSE OF A -- YOU KNOW, A PERSONAL, ETHIC OR A CONCERN ABOUT SPENDING CITY MONEY, YOU KNOW, IT'S AN INDIVIDUAL DECISION TO DO THAT. ASIDE FROM THAT, THERE'S REALLY NO PROVISION IN THE COUNCIL RULES TO PROVIDE FOR REIMBURSEMENT, AND IN TALKING TO MR. CRAWFORD, THIS ALLOWS THE SAME RULES THAT APPLY TO CITY STAFF TO BE APPLIED TO -- TO THE CITY COUNCIL. THERE ARE VERY STRONG RULES ABOUT WHAT'S AN ALLOWABLE EXPENSE, WHAT'S NOT, THE DEGREE OF BACKUP AND DOCUMENTATION FOR IT, AND WE THOUGHT THAT THIS WOULD PROVIDE THE MECHANISM TO MAKE THOSE RULES APPLICABLE TO COUNCIL AS WELL. I THINK THAT DOES ENHANCE, TRANSPARENCY IF COUNCIL DESIRES. WE COULD PROVIDE REPORTS ON A MONTHLY BASIS ON EXPENDITURES, BUT THERE ARE TWO SEPARATE ITEMS AND WHILE THE SPUR TO PUT THE ADMIN RULES IN PLACE WAS PROVIDING AN ALLOWANCE, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOU APPROVE THE ALLOWANCE OR USE IT, IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO HAVE THE RULES INCORPORATE THOSE SAME ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES THAT APPLY TO THE CITY STAFF.
01:57:40.609: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:57:41.510: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, MAYOR. TO ANSWER MY COLLEAGUE'S QUESTION, THE NEED FOR THIS HAS ARISEN FOR ME, BECAUSE I KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT IT, AND WHERE IT COULD BE APPLICABLE. BUT THE POLICE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION HAS BEEN INVITED, MEMBERS OF THAT AS WELL AS THE LIAISONS TO A CONFERENCE IN DETROIT ON POLICE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION. SO THERE'S A THREE-DAY CONFERENCE GOING ON IN DETROIT, LATE SEPTEMBER THAT I HOPE TO BE ATTENDING AND PERHAPS I WILL SUBMIT REIMBURSEMENT FOR THAT IN THAT CASE. AND I THINK FOLLOWING UP ON WHAT OUR ADMINISTRATOR HAS SAID, I MEAN, IT'S PROBABLY GOOD TO HAVE THIS IN PLACE. SO IT'S THERE WHEN WE NEED IT. AND BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, THERE'S GOING TO BE A NEED SOMEWHERE IN YOUR FOUR-YEAR TENURE THAT YOU MAY NEED IT. AND OBVIOUSLY IT'S GOOD TO EXTEND THROUGHOUT CITY HALL FOR ALL CITY EMPLOYEES.
01:58:47.909: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
01:58:48.877: >> Councilmember Nelson: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT EXPLANATION. THAT CLARIFIES THE ISSUE QUITE A LOT FOR ME AND I THINK I WOULD ALSO ADD THAT TO ME $500 STRIKES ME AS A RELATIVELY SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY. IT'S $500 FOR EACH OF US AND I -- IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE'S VERY LITTLE ROOM FOR ABUSE. I MEAN, PARTICULARLY IF MOVING FORWARD WE ANTICIPATE SOME OPPORTUNITY TO SEE WHAT THE $500 LOOKS LIKE, YOU KNOW, WHETHER OR NOT SOMEBODY TAKES IT, IF COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI WERE TO USE IT FOR SOMETHING AS LEGITIMATE AS THAT, CERTAINLY I WOULD HOPE THAT HE WAS NOT OPENING HIMSELF UP TO ACCUSATIONS OF INAPPROPRIATE ANYTHING OR, YOU KNOW -- IT STRIKES ME AS A SMALL TOKEN KIND OF.
01:59:35.290: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
01:59:37.292: >> Councilmember Eaton: I WANT TO REMIND MY COLLEAGUES OF THE CONTROVERSY THAT AROSE OVER REIMBURSED EXPENSES BY COUNTY COMMISSION MEMBERS IN 2011. WHEN YOU OPENED UP THIS CAN OF WORMS, YOU WILL HAVE PEOPLE SECOND GUESSING YOU, BOTH POLITICALLY AND IN A FIDUCIARY CAPACITY, AND I JUST DON'T THINK THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT TO EXPOSE YOURSELF TO. WHEN THERE'S DISCRETION OVER ASKING FOR AND RECEIVING MONEY, IT'S -- IT'S JUST FRAUGHT WITH DANGER FOR THE PERSON WHO SEEKS THE FUNDS. IF, IN FACT, WE WANT PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT, I THINK THAT WE SHOULD HOLD WORK SESSIONS AND PROVIDE ALL COUNCILMEMBERS THE SAME PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT, BRING IT IN-HOUSE, AND WE HAVE EXCELLENT STAFF THAT CAN TEACH US A LOT OF WHAT WE KNOW. WITH REGARD TO THE POLICE OVERSIGHT EXAMPLE, IF WE BROUGHT FORWARD AN INDIVIDUAL ITEM TO FUND THAT, I WOULD -- I WOULD SUPPORT THAT. I WILL REMIND MY COLLEAGUES THAT I SUPPORTED A LARGER BUDGET FOR THE POLICE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION, SO THAT THE INITIAL COMMISSION COULD HAVE ADEQUATE TRAINING. IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME THAT THE DIVERSE POPULATION OF THAT COMMISSION ALL HAVE THE SAME INFORMATION AND TRAINING WHEN THEY SET OUT ON THEIR TASK TO OVERSEE OUR POLICE DEPARTMENT. WE DIDN'T PASS THAT BUDGET AND SO NOW WE ARE GOING TO DO THIS INSTEAD. AND THAT SEEMS LIKE A LEGITIMATE USE FOR A COUPLE OF MEMBERS OF COUNCIL, BUT THEN OTHER COUNCILMEMBERS MAY USE IT FOR OTHER THINGS AND I WOULD POINT TO THE WISDOM OF SOME OF THE COUNTY COMMISSIONERS WHO ALTHOUGH THEY HAD ACCESS TO THE -- THAT REIMBURSEMENT POLICY, NEVER MADE A CLAIM FOR ANY MONEY AT ALL, AND THEREBY AVOIDED ALL THE CONTROVERSY THAT OTHER COUNTY BOARD OF COMMISSION MEMBERS GOT INVOLVED IN. AND I WILL BE VOTING AGAINST THIS BECAUSE I THINK IT IS -- IT'S DANGEROUS TO MAKE THIS AVAILABLE.
02:02:05.440: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
02:02:15.917: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANKS. SO THIS PROPOSAL IS TAKING PLACE ON THE 2020 BUDGET THAT INCLUDED THE $500 PER COUNCILMEMBER ALLOWANCE FOR REIMBURSABLE EXPENSES. I'M NOT SURE THAT IT WAS NECESSARY. I DON'T THINK IT'S INAPPROPRIATE. IT'S NOT A HUGE AMOUNT. WHAT I DO LIKE ABOUT THIS, RULE THREE, IT'S REASONABLE AND REIMBURSED ONLY SELECT EXPENSES. SO I THINK -- I THINK THESE ARE GOOD CONTROLS. THE REIMBURSEMENT REQUEST MUST BE SUPPORTED BY RECEIPTS AND DOCUMENTATION. THE MAYOR MUST APPROVE THE REIMBURSEMENT REQUESTS. OUR CFO WILL PREPARE A MONTHLY REPORT. I THINK THAT THE STRUCTURE IS SPECIFIC ENOUGH TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON WHAT'S REIMBURSABLE AND AS THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR SAID, IT'S CONSISTENT WITH HOW REIMBURSEMENT IS HANDLED FOR CITY EMPLOYEES. SO I THINK FOR ME, ONCE IT WAS DECIDED THAT THERE WOULD BE ALLOWANCES AND IT WAS APPROVED IN THE FISCAL 2020 BUDGET, IT'S APPROPRIATE TO HAVE RULES AND GUIDANCE ON HOW THESE ALLOWANCES AND REIMBURSEMENT WILL WORK. I -- I -- YOU KNOW, AGAIN, WHAT KIND OF EXPENSES ARE REIMBURSABLE AND WHAT AREN'T. I ALSO AGREE THAT IT'S APPROPRIATE TO ALLOW DOLLARS THAT ARE LEFT OVER AT THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR TO SIMPLY FLOW TO THE GENERAL FUND FUND BALANCE. SO THEY ARE NOT CARRIES OVER. IT'S ALSO APPROPRIATE BECAUSE YEARS AGO, IT WAS A SMALLER DOLLAR AMOUNT. AND THERE'S ONE CONTROVERSY WHEN SOME COUNCILMEMBERS DIDN'T SPEND THEIR -- THEIR ALLOWANCE. SOME OTHER COUNCILMEMBERS OVERSPENT THEIR ALLOWANCE AND SOME COUNCILMEMBERS -- SO THE ONES THAT OVERSPENT THEIR ALLOWANCE WERE THEN CAUGHT, IF YOU WILL. THEY WERE REQUESTING THAT THE COUNCILMEMBERS WHO DID NOT SPEND THEIR ALLOWANCE TO GIVE THEM THOSE MONIES. AND THAT BECAME KIND OF CONTROVERSIAL AND IT WAS OBVIOUSLY NOT APPROPRIATE. AND SO THE RULE HERE STIPULATES AND SPEAKS TO THAT. SO COUNCILMEMBERS CONDITION GIVE THEIR ALLOWANCE TO ANOTHER COUNCILMEMBER. THAT'S A GOOD THING. THAT'S A GOOD CONTROL AS WELL. SO I THINK THAT THESE RULES ARE GOOD RULES. THIS RULE 3, I WILL BE SUPPORTING IT.
02:04:59.114: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBERCR GRISWOLD.
02:05:03.585: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING THIS. I THINK IT'S MORE THAN JUST THE RULES. I THINK IT'S ALSO PUBLIC OPINION, AND WHILE I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN QUOTED CORRECTLY BY MLIVE, WE SAW TODAY THAT SOMETIMES MLIVE IS NOT ABSOLUTELY CORRECT, ACCORDING TO SOME PEOPLE. AND THEREFORE, I COULD SEE THIS BEING AN MLIVE ARTICLE. IT COULD BE USED FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES. EVERY DOLLAR IS A POTHOLE THAT'S NOT FILLED AND SO WHAT IS THE PUBLIC GOING TO -- HOW ARE THEY GOING TO DUNG US ON THIS? SO I THINK IT'S JUST -- IT'S A SMALL DOLLAR AMOUNT AND I REALLY DON'T THINK IT'S WORTH BUREAUCRATIC OVERHEAD OR THE POLITICAL RISK.
02:05:47.429: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
02:05:48.963: >> Councilmember Lumm: I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT -- SORRY. THAT THERE WILL BE NO REIMBURSEMENTS FOR MONEY THAT'S USED FOR PERSONAL USE OF ANY POLITICAL NATURE. AGAIN, GOOD RULE. SO WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, THIS ALLOCATION WAS APPROVED WITH WE APPROVED THE BUDGET. WE KNEW THAT. SO IF WE -- AND I'M FINE WITH THAT. IF WE DON'T APPROVE THIS ALLOWANCE AND WE NEED TO AMEND THE BUDGET TO RETURN THIS MONEY TO THE GENERAL FUND FUND BALANCE AT THIS INTEREST PO, -- AT THIS POINT BUT I THINK SOME PEOPLE WILL UTILIZE THIS MONEY AND -- AND TO HAVE A RULE, TO HAVE TEHAVE THESE RULES THAT ARE OUTLINED ARE IMPORTANT AND THESE ARE GOOD CONTROLS THAT WE NEED.
02:06:40.448: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
02:06:41.449: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, MAYOR TAYLOR. SORRY TO SPEND SO MUCH TIME ON THIS MATTER. YOU KNOW, THE FACT IS, WE DON'T NEED TO USE THIS MONEY IF YOU DON'T WANT TO, YOU CAN AVOID ALL SORTS OF ISSUES IF YOU ARE WORRIED ABOUT WHAT MLIVE IS GOING TO WRITE. DON'T SPEND IT. AND THEN IT'S $500 MORE IN THE GENERAL BUDGET. YOU KNOW, THE CITIZENS HAVE ELECTED US. THEY HAVE A LOT OF TRUST AND FAITH IN US, I HOPE. THEIR TRUST IN US WITH THE $400 MILLION BUDGET, BUT WE CAN'T TRUST OURSELVES WITH A $500 PERSONAL ALLOWANCE, $10 A WEEK? IT JUST -- THE MONEY IS ALREADY ALLOCATED. THESE ARE JUST RULES TO CHACLARIFYTHE RULES OF ALLOCATIT MONEY. IF YOU DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE SPENDING IT, YOU ARE NOT OBLIGED TO. FOR THE MEMBERS WHO ASKED FOR THIS, THEY ASKED FOR SPECIAL SERVICES, ADDITIONAL SERVICES TO HELP THEM WITH THEIR WORK. I WAS HERE WHEN THOSE ASKS WERE MADE. CITY ADMINISTRATOR PROVIDED SOMETHING FOR US. AND -- AND HERE WE ARE DEBATING THAT. SO IT'S -- IT'S A LITTLE ODD, BUT WE ALL HAVE A VOTE, I GUESS.
02:07:59.427: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLE CALL VOTE, PLEASE. STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
02:08:08.469: >> Councilmember Griswold: NO.
02:08:13.474: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES.

02:08:29.157: >> Mayor Taylor: LET'S TAKE A SHORT BREAK. [ BREAK ] I WAS HAVING SOME I.T. WOES.
02:19:46.533: >> Mayor Taylor: AFTER A SHORT BREAK, DC2, RESOLUTION TO APPOINT GEOFFREY PERKINS TO THE BUILDING BOARD OF AMIELS. MOVED BY NELSON AND. DISCUSSION OF DC2. ALL IN FAVOR. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED WITH 11 COUNCILMEMBERS PRESENT, AND ALL VOTING IN THE AFFIRMATIVE. DC-3, RESOLUTION TO OVERRIDE MAYOR'S VETO OF R-19-325, MOVED BY HAYNER AND SECONDED BY LUMM. DISCUSSION OF DC-3. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
02:20:23.504: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WILL START SINCE I BROUGHT THIS RESOLUTION. SO I THINK IT'S -- I THINK IT'S CLEAR WHY I WANT TO OVERRIDE THE MAYOR'S VETO ON THIS. WHEN I WAS RUNNING FOR COUNCIL, EVERY FORUM I WENT TO, EVERY INTERVIEW I HAD, PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW, ARE YOU FOR NONPARTISAN ELECTIONS? THIS ISN'T SOMETHING THAT CRAWLED OUT OF NOWHERE. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT FOR YEARS OVER AND OVER AGAIN. AND THE TIME HAS COME. THE TIME HAS COME TO JOIN THE REST OF THE CIVILIZED WORLD, AND HAVE NONPARTISAN ELECTIONS. THE BENEFITS ARE -- FAR OUTWEIGH ANY KIND OF CONCERNS THAT OUR MAYOR LIGHT HAVE ABOUT THE OTHER, AND IN THE LETTER THAT WAS SENT, MR. MAYOR, ABOUT YOUR VETO, THE BINARY LANGUAGE THAT WAS USED WAS STARTLING TO ME. IT WAS VERY DIVISIVE. IT'S US OR THEM. IF YOU ARE NOT LIKE ME, YOU ARE NOT WELCOME ON THE BALANCE BALLOT.IT'S NOT THE KIND OF INCLUSIVITY THAT WE WANT TO HAVE AS AI CITY. NONPARTISAN ELECTIONS ARE AN IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD. WE TALK ABOUT DIVERSITY IN OUR COMMUNITY. DIVERSITY IS DIVERSITY OF OPINIONS, DIVERSITY OF THOUGHT, DIVERSITY OF POLITICAL BEHAVIOR AND ALL ARE WELCOME HERE AND ALL ARE WELCOME HERE IN A NONPARTISAN WAY. AND SO THAT'S WHY I WAS HAPPY TO COSPONSOR THIS RESOLUTION INITIALLY AND I'M HAPPY TO COSPONSOR THIS RESOLUTION TO ATTEMPT TO OVERRIDE THAT VETO, WHICH I SEE AS SORT OF A HEAVY-HANDED ATTEMPT TO PROP UP THE STATUS QUO. AND TO BE HONEST, I HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT THE COHESIVENESS AND THE LEADERSHIP THAT WE ARE SEEING FROM THE MAYOR'S OFFICE WHEN YOU HAVE FEARS THAT YOUR POLITICAL CAREER MIGHT SUDDENLY BE CHALLENGED OUTSIDE THE PARTISAN BUBBLE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO THINK. MAINTAINING PARTISAN ELECTIONS CONTINUES TO DISENFRANCHISE A LARGE GROUP OF IMPORTANT RESIDENTS TO THE CITY. THE STUDENT POPULATION. WHEN THE STUDENTS ARE HERE, WE HAVE NONPARTISAN ELECTIONS. THEY ARE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN OUR DEMOCRACY. AND I THINK THAT WE WOULD BE A BETTER CITY IF THEY WERE. AND FOR THAT REASON ALONE, WE SHOULD HAVE NONPARTISAN ELECTIONS TO SPEAK NOTHING OF ALL THE OTHER DISENFRANCHISEMENT THAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GO TO THE AUGUST BALLOT BOX ON THE AUGUST PRIMARY AND YOU HAVE TO STAY ON ONE SIDE OF THE TICKET OR ANOTHER. WE HAD A SOCIALIST WHO RAN AGAINST MYSELF IN NOVEMBER THIS YEAR. AND SO SOCIALISM IS BOOMING RIGHT NOW IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND OUTSIDE THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. AND SO IMAGINE IF WE CONTINUE WITH PARTISAN ELECTIONS AND THEN WE WILL HAVE -- A SOCIALIST WILL GO DOWN THERE AND SAY, OH, I WANT TO VOTE FOR MY SOCIALIST PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, BUT I HAVE NO SAY AT ALL -- I'M COMPLETELY DISENFRANCHISED TO VOTING FOR MY CITY COUNCIL, BECAUSE THEY HAVE TWO DEMOCRATS. THEY WON'T HAND ME THE BOARD REP, IF I WANT TO VOTE FOR A SOCIALIST PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE. AND HOW MUCH MORE -- HOW MUCH LESS INCLUSIVE CAN YOU GET THAN THAT? I MEAN, NONPARTISAN IS -- IS THE WAIVE OF THE FUTURE. IT'S INCLUSIVITY AND I SAY IT'S TIME WE GET ON WITH IT. AND EVERYBODY -- I HAVEN'T RECEIVED ONE EMAIL OR ONE COMMENT OR ONE PERSON STOP ME ON THE STREET SAYING, PLEASE, PLEASE STAY WITH THAT PARTISAN TICKET. NOBODY. EVERYBODY I KNOW -- I MEAN, I HAVEN'T HAD ANYBODY REACH OUT TO ME AND SAY, DON'T BOTHER OVERRIDING THIS VETO, WE LOVE OUR PARTISAN BALLOTS OF THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO LOVE THE PARTISAN BALLOTS ARE THE PEOPLE WHO CONTINUE TO BENEFIT FROM THE STATUS QUO. AND THAT'S NOT INCLUSIVITY AND THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M HERE FOR. I'M SPEAKING TO THE FOUR FOLKS WOULD VOTED AGAINST IT LAST WEEK AN I URGE YOU TO RECONSIDER YOUR POSITION. THIS IS WHAT THE PEOPLE WANT. THE TIME HAS COME. THE MAJORITY OF US PUT IT ON THE BALLOT. LET THE PEOPLE DECIDE. THERE'S NOTHING TO FEAR FROM PUTTING SOMETHING ON THE BALLOT. LET THE PEOPLE SPEAK. THANK YOU.
02:25:03.417: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
02:25:04.885: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU VERY MUCH, COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER. IT WAS ELOQUENTLY PUT, AND VERY PERSUASIVELY PUT AND I TOO AM I SPEAKING TO MY COLLEAGUES WHO VOTED NOT TO ALLOW THIS QUESTION TO BE PLACED OPEN THE BALLOT. OBVIOUSLY I BELIEVE THAT THE ARGUMENTS FOR MOVING TOARTISAN N ANN ARBOR ARE VERY COMPELLING. HAVING THE DECIDING VOTES WHEN TURNOUT IS HIGHER, INCREASING PARTICIPATION IN TERMS THE CANDIDATES AND VOTER EDUCATION, BUT I WANT TO USE MY TIME TONIGHT TO SPEAK TO THE MAYOR'S VETO AND THE ACCOMPANYING MESSAGE THAT WAS ISSUED. FIRST, IT'S CRITICAL TO LOOK AT WHAT THE VETOED RESOLUTION DID AND DID NOT DO. IT DID NOT CHANGE THE BASIS OF ANN ARBOR'S LOCAL ELECTIONS TO NONPARTISAN. IT DID PLACE THE QUESTION ON THE BAL BALLOTS FOR VOTERS TO DECIDE IN NOVEMBER. ISSUING A VETO NOT TO REVERSE AN ACTION OR POLICY BUT TO BLOCK A VOTER REFERENDUM IS DRAMATIC, AND NOT YOUR EVERYDAY OCCURRENCE. SO I ASKED STAFF IF THIS HAD EVER BEEN DONE BEFORE. THEY RESEARCHED BACK TO 1976, AND THIS WOULD BE THE FIRST. UNPRECEDENTED. THE FIRST MAYOR TO ISSUE A VETO TO BLOCK A VOTER REFERENDUM AT LEAST GOING BACK TO 1976 AND THAT INCLUDES A LOT OF MAYORS. THE VIEW HE TOE MESSAGE CONCLUDED BY SAYING THAT THE CHANGE TO NONPARTISAN WOULD, QUOTE, CREATE A REAL AND SUBSTANTIAL HARM, END QUOTE. THAT'S NONSENSE AND SO OVER THE TOP IT'S LAUGHABLE. REAL AND SUBSTANTIAL HARM? HOW MUCH REAL AND SUBSTANTIAL HARM HAS IT CAUSED IN THE CITY WE OFTEN BENCHMARK, WORSHIP FOR THAT MATTER AND ASPIRE TO BE, LIKE BOULDER, MADISON, BERKELEY, AUSTIN? THEY SEEM TO BE DOING QUITE WELL WITH NONPARTISAN ELECTIONS. HOW MUCH REAL AND SUBSTANTIAL HARM HAS IT CAUSED EVERY OTHER CITY IN MICHIGAN, EXCEPT YPSILANTI AND IONIA. THEY TOO SEEM TO BE FINE WITH NONPARTISAN ELECTIONS. IF THIS WOULD MAKE ANN ARBOR ODD OR AN OUTLYER, THAT WOULD BE ONE THING BUT THIS IS EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE. ANN ARBOR IS THE OUTLIER NOW. WITH PARTISAN LOCAL ELECTIONS. THIS CHANGE WOULD BRING US IN LINE WITH THESE BENCHMARK CITIES AND EVERY OTHER -- VIRTUALLY EVERY OTHER MICHIGAN MICHIGAN -- CITY IN MICHIGAN. THE VOTERS HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO WEIGH IN ON THIS QUESTION SINCE THE 1950s. UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE ANN ARBOR IS THE OUTLIER AND FOLKS HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO WEIGH IN AT 60 YEARS IT TAKES A SUPREME ARROGANCE TO CONCLUDE THAT IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE TO DO A VOTER REFERENDUM AND TAKE A CONSCIOUS, EXTRAORDINARY ACTION TO PREVENT IT. IT TAKES AN EXTRAORDINARY CONVICTION THAT YOU KNOW BETTER THAN YOUR COLLEAGUES, KNOW BETTER THAN THE VOTERS OF ANN ARBOR AND KNOW BETTER THAN ANY OF THOSE OTHER CITIES THAT WE WORSHIP AND ASPIRE TO BE LIKE. THAT'S QUOTE A BAR TO GET OVER, BUT SOMEHOW THE MAYOR DID IT. IT WAS SILENT ON THE ISSUING OF A VETO TO PREVENT A VOTER REFERENDUM. ALL IT SAID WAS THAT SURELY NOT EVERY QUESTION THAT MUST GO TO COULD GO TOTHE VOTERS MUST GO TE VOTERS. BD QUOTE. THIS IS A FRIVOLOUS, TRIVIAL QUESTION NOT WORTHY OF VOTER CONSIDERATION. THAT TOO IS OBVIOUSLY NONSENSE. THERE'S NOT ANY MORE IMPORTANT QUESTION THAN HOW WE CONDUCT OUR E ELECTIONS. THE MAYOR'S MENTIONED THAT WE DID NOT PLACE FOUR-YEAR TERMS ON THE BALLOT. OKAY. GUILT. THERE IS NO COMPARISON. IN NONPARTISAN PROPOSAL IS INTENDED TO SERVE VOTERS AND ENGAGE MORE OF THEM, AS CANDIDATES AND BETTER EDUCATED VOTERS. THAT PROPOSAL FOR FOUR-YEAR TERMS ONLY SERVED US, THE ELECTED OFFICIALS, NOT RESIDENTS. I WOULD ARGUE THAT FOUR-YEAR TERMS HAS REDUCED OUR ACCOUNTABILITY TO YOU AND THAT'S A DISSERVICE TO OUR RESIDENTS. SO ONE SERVED ELECTED OFFICIALS AND ONE WOULD SERVE RESIDENTS. YOU CAN'T GET MORE DIFFERENT THAN THAT. I'M SEEING TWO VERY DISTURBING TRENDS AND PROCLIVITIES WITH THE MAYOR. ONE, A DISREGARD FOR THE WILLING VOICE OF THE PEOPLE AND TWO, NO VERSION TO MESSING WITH ELECTIONS. THE MAYOR HAS NOW ISSUED TWO VETOES. ONE WAS TO PROVENT -- TO PREVENT REFLECTING THE COMMUNITY'S INPUT ON HOW TO SPEND THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH AND PUBLIC SAFETY MILLAGE PROCEDURES. AND NOW THIS, TO PREVENT A REFERENDUM ON A KEY POLICY QUESTION. THE COMMON THREAD, BOTH VETOES SERVED TO SUBVERT THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE AT THE EXPENSE OF THE MAYOR'S VIEWS. THIS VETO ISN'T THE FIRST TIME THE MAYOR HAS INSERTED HIMSELF INTO A REFERENDUM QUESTION. ON THE CENTER OF THE CITY BALLOT INITIATIVE, THE MAYOR DID NOT SUPPORT PLACING THE QUESTION ON THE BALLOT EITHER. SINCE HE CAN'T VETO A VOTER I NAISHIATED BALLOT REFERENDUM, HE LED TO EFFORT TO INSERT LANGUAGE TO VOTE AGAINST THE PROPOSAL. THAT INFAMOUS QUOTE EXPLANATORY CAPTION, END QUOTE WAS SUBSEQUENTLY THROWN OUT BY THE COURTS. WHAT THIS SEEMS TO N COMMON SDEMONSTRATE,THE MAYOR IS NOT AS WITH THE END RESULTS THAT HE WANTS. THERE'S JUST NOT ANY GOOD REASON WHY VOTERS SHOULDN'T DECIDE THE QUESTION. I'M HOPEFUL THREE COUNCILMEMBERS OPPOSED WILL RECONSIDER THEIR PREVIOUS POSITION OR ADD A MINIMUM CONCLUDE IT'S JUST NOT APPROPRIATE TO VETO A VOTER REFERENDUM SUPPORTED BY SEVEN OF HIS TEN COLLEAGUES. SORRY, I DON'T THINK THAT'S GOOD LEADERSHIP. OBVIOUSLY, YOU WILL BE SUPPORTING THE OVERRIDE TONIGHT BUT IF IT DOES NOT PASS, I AND OTHERS WILL BEGIN COLLECTING PETITION SIGNATURES. I HAVE HEARD FROM MANY, MANY RESIDENTS, THANK YOU VERY MUCH, WHO FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT THIS, MANY WHEN GENEROUSLY OFFERED TO COLLECT SIGNATURES SOME WHO HAVE DONE RESEARCH AND IT'S ALL GREATLY APPRECIATED. CLERK BEAUDRY, HAS INDICATED THE REFERENDUM MUST OCCUR AT A REGULARLY SCHEDULED ELECTION. AND THAT IS -- SO THERE ARE TWO SETS OF RULES, BASICALLY. ELECTED OFFICIALS CAN PLACE A REFERENDUM QUESTION ON VIRTUALLY ANY BALLOT. CITIZEN INITIATED PETITIONS CAN ONLY APPEAR ON PRIMARY AND GENERAL ELECTION BALLOTS. SO THIS NOVEMBER ISN'T DOABLE, UNFORTUNATELY. BUT WE, THE PLAN GOING FORWARD, TO ALL OF THOSE WHO HAVE KINDLY REACHED OUT AND OFFERED TO HELP, WE WILL PLAN FOR THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE DATE TO DO THIS, BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY FORWARD THAT'S NOT -- THAT IS VETO PROOF FROM THE MAYOR. SO WE WILL GET THIS QUESTION BEFORE YOU. I'M SORRY WE HAVE TO JUMP THROUGH ALL OF THESE HOOPS. WE HAVE TO COLLECT 5100 SIGNATURES AS OF THIS POINT IN TIME. BUT PEOPLE ARE VERY ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT HELPING. THIS MATTERS A LOT TO OUR COMMUNITY AND SO WE ARE GOING TO GET THE JOB DONE, NO MATTER HOW DIFFICULT YOU MAKE IT FOR THE FOLKS IN YOUR COMMUNITY, MR. MAYOR.
02:32:59.059: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
02:33:01.361: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, MAYOR. THANK YOU TO MY COLLEAGUES WHO SPOKE BEFORE ME. I WON'T BE AS LONG BECAUSE OF IT. I SHARE MANY OF THE SAME CONCERNS. IT'S NO SECRET HOW DISAPPOINTED I AM IN THE MAYOR. MY COMMENT ON MLIVE, I STILL STAND BY THEM. THIS IS AN ABUSE OF VETO POWER, UNLIKE YOUR FIRST VETO. YOUR FIRST VETO -- AND I UNDERSTAND IT'S IN THE CITY CHARTER. I GET IT. AND THE REBUTTAL WILL BE IT'S DEMOCRATIC. IT'S IN THE CITY CHARTER. I CAN DO THIS. THERE'S NOTHING THAT'S NOT UNDEMOCRATIC, BUT WHEN YOU STRIP THE VOTES OF 70% OF THE ELECTED OFFICIALS THAT ARE UP HERE ON A MEASURE THAT WE PASSED THAT DEALS WITH HOW THE DEMOCRACY FUNCTIONS IN OUR COMMUNITY, NOT ALLOWING IT TO GO TO THE COMMUNITY FOR THEM TO VOTE AND, AGAIN, BASED ON ALL OF THESE STUDIES, WE'RE THE MOST HIGHLY EDUCATED COMMUNITY IN THE COUNTRY. SOME MAY DISAGREE WITH THAT AFTER WATCHING THE CITY COUNCIL MEETING, BUT THAT IS THE FACTS. BUT WE DON'T TRUST THEM TO GO IN AND MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION. THEY MUST HIDE BEHIND LABELS OR USE LABELS, TAKE COMPLEX ISSUES AND SIMPLY PUT A LABEL ON IT. THAT DUMBS DOWN THE CONVERSATION. THAT HAS GOT US TO WHERE WE ARE AT TODAY IN OUR COUNTRY. MY BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH THIS VETO IS, YES, YOU TOOK IT AWAY FROM THE VOTERS, BUT YOU ALSO STRIPPED OUR POWERS AND EACH ONE OF US REPRESENTS 20,000 RESIDENTS. YOU KNOW, THE -- THERE ARE OVER 40% OF PEOPLE WHO IDENTIFY THEMSELVES AS INDEPENDENTS WHEN THEY GO TO THE VOTING BOOTH OR WHEN THEY GET CALLED ON THE PHONE, BUT WHEN THEY GO TO THE VOTING BOOTH, THEY ARE JUST GIVEN TWO CHOICES OR THREE TO CHOOSE FROM. WE HAVE DISENFRANCHISED SO MANY PEOPLE ALONG THE WAY AND THEN WE WONDER WHY THE TURNOUT IS SO LOW. IT'S NOT A SURPRISE TO SOMEONE LIKE ME. IF THIS VETO FAILS -- AND I HOPE IT DOESN'T. I HOPE ONE OF THE MEMBERS WHO DIDN'T SUPPORT IT TWO WEEKS AGO WILL FIND IT TODAY THAT THE RIGHT THING TO DO FOR OUR COMMUNITY AND FOR THIS COUNCIL IS TO RALLY AND FUNCTION AS A WORKING BODY. AND IF THIS VETO IS ALLOWED TO STAND, THE 2020 ELECTION IS NOT GOING TO BE VERY GOOD FOR THE PEOPLE THAT SUPPORT THIS VETO OVERRIDE. THIS WILL BE THE BATTLE CRY IN THE 2020 ELECTIONS. AND WHAT ARE THE FOLKS WHO SUPPORT THIS VETO HIDING BEHIND? IT'S MORE THAN WHAT WAS GIVEN IN THAT LETTER BECAUSE, FRANKLY, DEMOCRATS DON'T OWN, YOU KNOW, A PATENT ON THESE ISSUES. WE NEED TO BECOME MORE INCLUSIVE. AND THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE WITH DIFFERENT VIEW POINTS AND DIFFERENT HISTORIES AND DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS AND THEY DON'T BELONG TO A CLIQUE. THEY DON'T BELONG TO A GROUP. THEY DIDN'T COME THROUGH A FARM SYSTEM OF PEOPLE IN THE KNOW. THEY ARE AVERAGE ORDINARY CITIZENS WOULD PUT ON THEIR PANTS THE SAME WAY WE DO AND GO OUT THERE AND WHO WANT TO SERVE THEIR COMMUNITY AND WANT TO MAKE THIS PLACE A BETTER PLACE. THEY DON'T CARE IF THERE A D OR R, LOCAL ISSUES ARE NONPARTISAN AND I SAND BY THAT. -- AND STAND BY THAT.
02:37:28.561: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
02:37:29.429: >> Councilmember Nelson: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I WANT TO REITERATE A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT HAS BEEN SAID BEFORE ME, LIKE COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, I HAVE NOT GOTTEN ANY FEEDBACK FROM ANYBODY SAYING, OH, PLEASE, PRESERVE OUR PARTISAN ELECTIONS. I THINK WE NEED TO BE HONEST ABOUT WHO IS ADVANTAGED BY THIS. A LOT HAS BEEN SAID JUST GENERALLY AND PHILOSOPHICALLY IN SUPPORT OF NONPARTISAN ELECTIONS BUT I WANT TO SPEAK ABOUT JUST THE PRACTICAL EFFECT OF WORKING HARDER TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A CONTESTED ELECTION IF WE CAN HAVE ONE IN NOVEMBER. AND THERE WAS A SITUATION IN WARD 4, AS RECENTLY AS 2016, UNDER THE CURRENT SYSTEM, AN INCUMBENT WAS ABLE TO HOLD ON TO THEIR SEAT WITH 40% OF THE VOTE BECAUSE IT WAS SPLIT -- THE VOTE WAS SPLIT THREE WAYS. IF WE ALLOWED VOTERS TO CONSIDER A MEASURE LIKE THE BALLOT MEASURE THAT WAS JUST VETOED, THERE WOULD BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE TWO HIGHEST VOTE GETTERS IN A PRIMARY IN AUGUST TO GO ON TO NOVEMBER. AND THAT'S SIGNIFICANT IN TERMS OF HOW MANY MORE PEOPLE ARE IN THIS TOWN ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN AN ELECTION IN NOVEMBER. SO I JUST WANT TO SPEAK TO MY COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE SUPPORT -- WHO COULD THEORETICALLY CHANGE THEIR MINDS AND NOT SUPPORT THIS VETO. DO YOU REALLY WANT TO STAND FOR THIS DISENFRANCHISING VOTERS IN THIS WAY, THIS REAL WAY THAT HAPPENED JUST RECENTLY AS TWO AND A HALF YEARS AGO, DISENFRANCHISING, STUDENTS AND EVERYBODY WHO DOESN'T CHOOSE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY. THAT NUMBER IS GROWING. PEOPLE ARE BECOMING DISILLUSIONED WITH THE TWO PARTIES AS THEY EXIST. I REALLY HOPE THAT WE COME OUT OF THIS MEETING WITH A WAY FORWARD THAT DOESN'T INVOLVE A WHOLE LOT OF FRUSTRATED MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY HAVING TO RUN AROUND WITH PETITIONS BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT WILL HAPPEN. THANK YOU.
02:39:24.544: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
02:39:30.383: >> Councilmember Griswold: LAST TIME I SPOKE ABOUT THIS ISSUE, I TALKED ABOUT AN ASSAULT ON DEMOCRACY, BUT THIS IS SO MUCH MORE THAN THAT. AND I DON'T EXPECT ANYONE HERE TO CHANGE THEIR MINDS BECAUSE THAT'S HOW THIS COUNCIL WORKS. BUT THERE WILL BE A TREMENDOUS COST TO OUR CITIZENS BECAUSE WHAT WILL HAPPEN -- OR AT LEAST THE ATTEMPT IS TO CONTROL THE ELECTION IN 2020. AND IT WILL BE ABOUT SPECIAL INTERESTS AND IT WILL BE ABOUT WISHFUL THINKING. AND I KNOW I ALWAYS TALK ABOUT PEDESTRIAN SAFETY, BUT THAT'S WHAT I FEEL MOST PASSIONATE ABOUT AND THAT'S WHAT HURTS ME EVERY TIME THERE IS A SERIOUS INJURY ACCIDENT IN THIS COMMUNITY THAT DIDN'T NEED TO HAPPEN BECAUSE WE DIVERTED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF TRANSPORTATION FUNDING FROM OUR ROADWAYS WHILE WE HAD A TEN-YEAR M MORATORIUM ON STREET LIGHTS TO PLANS FOR A TRAIN STATION. SPECIAL INTERESTS. WE -- THE VOTERS SPOKE IN 2018 AND THEY WANTED SOME CHANGES. THEY WANTED BACK TO BASICS. THEY WANTED SAFE CROSSWALKS. THEY WANTED ILLUMINATION AT THEIR CROSSWALKS. POSITIVE CONTRASTS LIGHTING. THEY WANTED DATA ANALYSIS OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING. DATA-DRIVEN DECISIONS. NOT WISHFUL THINKING, WHICH WE HAD FOR ALMOST TWO DECADES. WE HAVE A COUNCIL MAJORITY NOW THAT IS PREPARED AND EDUCATED AND THEY HAVE THE SKILL SET TO BE DISCIPLINED AND MAKE DATA-DRIVEN DECISIONS. BUT WE HAVE A SMALL MINORITY AND THE MAYOR WHO HAS THE POWER TO CONTINUE WISHFUL THINKING AND SPECIAL INTERESTS AND THERE WILL BE A NEGATIVE IMPACT, A REAL NEGATIVE IMPACT OF SOME OF OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS, ESPECIALLY OUR MORE VULNERABLE COMMUNITY MEMBERS, INCLUDING CHILDREN WALKING TO SCHOOL IN UNLIT CROSSWALKS BECAUSE WE HAVE DIVERTED MONEY TO SPECIAL INTERESTS. THANK YOU.
02:42:01.467: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND?
02:42:04.203: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. IT WILL PROBABLY COME AS NO SURPRISE TO MEMBERS OF THIS BODY THAT I CERTAINLY DO NOT INTEND TO SUPPORT THE OVERRIDE. I THOUGHT LONG AND HARD ABOUT THIS DECISION. ONE, I DON'T THINK THAT PLACING ANYTHING ON THE ODD YEAR NOVEMBER BALLOT WHERE TURNOUT OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS HAS GONE BETWEEN 8.7% AND 19% IS ACTUALLY THE RIGHT TIME FOR VOTERS TO BE VOTING ON THIS ISSUE. WHEN WE WENT TO FOUR-YEAR TERMS, I WAS RARING TO GO THE YEAR BEFORE IN AN ODD YEAR ELECTION AND WAS REMINDED BY ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES THAT WE SHOULD PUT THIS TO A VOTE WHEN THEY ARE -- DURING A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. I KNOW THAT MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES WHO SUPPORT THE OTHER SIDE HAVEN'T HEARD FROM RESIDENTS, BUT I CERTAINLY. HAVE MANY OF THEM THAT HAVE ASKED ME TO PLEASE HOLD THIS LINE AND HOLD STRONG TO MAINTAINING PARTISAN ELECTIONS. I VEHEMENTLY DISAGREE THAT THERE ARE ISSUES IN THIS COMMUNITY THAT ARE -- THAT EVERYTHING WE DEAL WITH IS NONPARTISAN. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S TRUE. AND I'M VERY CONCERNED. I HAVE SEEN ISSUES IN NONPARTISAN E ELECTIONS IN THE CITY WHERE THE FOLKS HAVE PACKED ROOMS FOR NONPARTISAN ELECTIONS AND THEY GOTTEN ENFORCEMENTS FROM LOCAL PARTIES AND THEY ARE THE CANDIDATES WOULD WON THE ELECTIONS. THAT'S A LESS DEMOCRATIC PROCESS THAN THE ONE WE HAVE NOW. DO I BELIEVE IT'S IMPERFECT? ABSOLUTELY. IF STATE LAW CHANGES WHERE WE COULD GET SOMETHING TO A NOVEMBER BALLOT, THAT IS BETTER THAN WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED WHERE I SUPPORT IT, ABSOLUTELY, I WOULD. I ALSO JUST HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT NONPARTISAN ELECTIONS BEING MOVED DOWN BALLOT AND HAVING LESS PARTICIPATION, BUT -- BUT ULTIMATELY -- AND I CERTAINLY TAKE OFFENSE AT THINKING THAT IF WE GO FROM -- IF WE MAINTAIN PARTISAN ELECTIONS THAT OUR CHILDREN WILL BE LESS SAFE. THAT WE -- YOU KNOW, IF IT WERE REALLY THAT COMPELLING OF AN IDEA, THE MAYOR WAS ELECTED WITH A -- WITH A LARGE MAJORITY OF VOTES. IF IT WAS THAT COMPELLING, THERE WOULD BE VOLTS AT THIS TABLE. THERE'S PLENTY OF OTHER ISSUES WHERE WE NEED EIGHT VOTES AT THIS TABLE AND NOW THIS IS ONE OF THEM TODAY. I UNDERSTAND THE FRUSTRATIONS. I HAVE SAT ON THE OTHER SIDE WHERE I HAVE BEEN ONE OF SEVEN, AND WE DIDN'T HAVE EIGHT. AND I KNOW WHAT THAT FEELS LIKE AND I EMPATHIZE WITH IT. AND IF -- YOU KNOW, IF ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES CAN BE CONVINCED, THEN SO BE IT. BUT WHEN WE HAVE IMPORTANT CRITICAL DECISIONS TO MAKE, SOMETIMES IT TAKES EIGHT VOTES TO GET THERE, AND I'M NOT SURE THERE ARE EIGHT VOTES TONIGHT.
02:45:11.791: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER SMITH, LUMM, HAYNER, RAMLAWI. COUNCILMEMBER SMITH.
02:45:18.330: >> Councilmember Smith: I JUST WANT TO TALK ABOUT GOVERNING FOR A SECOND. YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES WHEN YOU TRY TO MOVE POLICY IDEAS FORWARD, YOU HAVE TO FIND PEOPLE TO FIND COMMON GROUND WITH. I TAKE GREAT OFFENSE TO WHAT COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD SAID DURING HER SPEECH THAT SAYS THAT PEOPLE DON'T CHANGE THEIR MIND AND CANNOT POSSIBLY, YOU KNOW, HAVE DIFFERENT POSITIONS. WHAT I WOULD SAY TO THIS IS IN THE TWO WEEKS SINCE WE HAD THIS VOTE, I HAVE VERY CLEARLY SAID THAT THIS NEEDS -- FOR ME TO SUPPORT THIS, IT NEEDS TO BE ON THE NOVEMBER 2020 BALLOT, AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE LAST THREE ELECTIONS WHERE THE SCHOOL -- THE SCHOOL BOND ISSUE WAS THE MAIN REASON FOR PEOPLE TO COME OUT, THE TURNOUT WAS 9, 10, AND 21%. I LOOK AT THIS AS NOTHING MORE THAN TRYING TO SNEAK SOMETHING THROUGH DURING AN ELECTION YEAR WHEN NOBODY IS PAYING ATTENTION THAT WILL SERVE TO EMPOWER MONEY. IT WILL SERVE TO EMPOWER INCUMBENTS. IF WE ARE TALKING ABOUT DATA-DRIVEN DECISION MAKING, I DON'T -- YOU KNOW, I HAVE DONE SOME RESEARCH ABOUT TRYING TO FIND THE STATISTICS THAT NONPARTISAN ELECTIONS INCREASE TURNOUT. I FOUND OFTEN CONCERNS THAT THEY EWE  SUPPRESS TURNOUT BECAE OF THE LACK OF INFORMATION. GOING BACK TO MY POINT ABOUT GOVERNING, IS IN THE TWO WEEKS SINCE WE HAD THIS VOTE, NOT A SINGLE PERSON CALLED ME OR EMAILED ME THAT WE'RE SPONSORING THIS RESOLUTION TO SAY, HOW CAN WE GET YOU TO CHANGE YOUR MIND? WHAT CAN WE DO? THAT SEEMS TO ME TO BE THE DEFINITION OF POOR LEADERSHIP, THAT IT'S -- YOU DO IT OUR WAY OR WE'RE JUST NOT GOING TO TALK TO YOU. I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE A POSITION. BUT WHEN THERE'S A MIDDLE GROUND TO BE FOUND, I THINK WE NEED -- WE OWE IT TO THE PEOPLE OF THE CITY TO TRY TO FIND IT AND I THINK THAT THIS IS LAZY. I THINK THIS IS INEPT. AND I THINK THAT THIS IS JUST A GIANT PIECE OF GRAND STANDING. SO I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THE MAYOR, UPHOLD THE VETO. I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU ARE GOING TO GET TO EIGHT, BUT WE CAN TALK ABOUT IT FOR ANOTHER HOUR.
02:47:42.741: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
02:47:49.682: >> Councilmember Lumm: SO I SAW COUNCILMEMBER SMITH IN SOME EMAILS, YOU SAY THAT I DIDN'T REACH OUT TO YOU. WELL, I WILL TELL YOU WHY. I HONESTLY THOUGHT YOU WERE SORRY, A LOST CAUSE ON THIS MATTER. I VOTED AGAINST IT. THIS IS NOW THE FOURTH TIME YOU VOTED AGAINST PLACING THIS QUESTION ON THE BALLOT. AND YOU SAID, YEAH, I WILL SUPPORT IT IN 2020, TO PUT IT ONON THE PRESIDENTIAL BALLOT IN 2020. WHAT DID YOU DO IN 2016, YOU VOTED AGAINST IT. COUNCIL HAS REJECTED THIS IN 2015, 2016, 2018, 2019. COUNCILMEMBER SMITH, YOU VOTED AGAINST THIS THREE TIMES. SO THE LAST PRESIDENTIAL BALLOT, YEAH. YOU COULDN'T FIND YOUR WAY TO SUPPORT PLACING THIS QUESTION ON THE BALLOT FOR VOTERS. SO WHAT ARE THE ODDS THAT YOU WOULD BE OKAY ALLOWING VOTERS TO WEIGH IN ON THIS? SLIM, FAT AND NONE AT BEST, BASED ON YOUR VOTING RECORD ON THIS QUESTION ALONE. SO TO THE PEOPLE THAT COUNCILMEMBER SMITH HAS WRITTEN SAYING, HEY, YEAH, I WILL SUPPORT THIS IN 2020, DON'T TAKE THAT TO THE BANK. YOU DIDN'T DO IT IN 2016. HE'S NOT ABOUT TO AND I REALLY RESENT YOUR STATEMENT THAT THIS WAS LAME, LAZY, WHATEVER THOSE OTHER -- YOU KNOW, THOSE CRITICAL WORDS THAT YOU JUST USED TO DESCRIBE THIS. WE SHOULD PUT A LOT OF TIME IN THIS WITH THE CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE OVER THE YEARS WITH THE -- WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE TO APPROVE THE LANGUAGE IT TAKES A LOT OF EFFORT AND APPRECIATE THE ASSISTANCE I HAVE RECEIVED. AND, YOU KNOW, AFTER TRYING FOUR TIMES AT THIS, TO FINALLY HAVE SEVEN VOTES TO PLACE THIS QUESTION ON THE BALLOT, IT WAS -- IT WAS SUCH AN EXHILARATING MOMENT. ONLY TO THEN HAVE AS COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI SAID -- I MEAN, MOST IMPORTANTLY, IT IS ABOUT NOT ALLOWING -- NOT TRUSTING RESIDENTS TO WEIGH IN ON THIS QUESTION BECAUSE WE ARE NOT DECIDING IT QUESTION. AND FOR YOU I GET IT. YOU DON'T WANT TO GIVE HIM THAT OPPORTUNITY AT ANY TIME. YOU HAVE HAD, AGAIN, MANY OPPORTUNITIES TO DO THAT. BUT TO ALSO PREVENT A VOTER REFERENDUM THAT A STRONG MAJORITY, SEVEN OF 11 COUNCIL FELT WAS IMPORTANT, YOU KNOW, IS INSULTING AND DISMISSIVE OF THE PEOPLE THAT THE MAYOR IS SUPPOSED TO LEAD AND OF YOUR COLLEAGUES. AND, YOU KNOW IT SENDS VERY CLEAR AND VERY TROUBLING MESSAGES THAT, AGAIN, NOT ONLY DO WE NOT TRUST THE VOTERS. WE DON'T TRUST OUR COLLEAGUES. WE KNOW BEST. AND THE OPINIONS OF OUR COLLEAGUES, THE OPINIONS OF OUR VOTERS ARE NOT IMPORTANT AND WE ARE NOT GOING TO ASK THEM. THEY ARE NOT RELEVANT. AND THAT THE MAYOR WILL DO OBVIOUSLY ANYTHING UNPRECEDENTED OR NOT TO ACHIEVE THE OUTCOMES THAT IN HIS VIEW ARE THE RIGHT ONES. SO, YOU KNOW, IT IS TRULY AN ASSAULT ON THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE. IT REALLY IS. AND SO HOWEVER YOU VOTE TONIGHT, THERE ARE PEOPLE HERE WHO ARE GOING TO HAVE EGG ON THEIR FACES BECAUSE THIS IS GOING TO BE PLACED ON THE BALLOT. YOU CAN TAKE THAT TO THE BANK. I PERSONALLY WILL NOT ON EVERY DOOR IN THE CITY IF THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES. I KNOW I WON'T HAVE TO BECAUSE LOTS OF PEOPLE IS STEPPED UP ALREADY AND PETITION LANGUAGE IS -- ACTUALLY, PEOPLE ARE VERY ENCOURAGED THAT WE COULD GET THIS DONE FOR THE NOVEMBER BALLOT, THAT THEY COULD MEET THE JULY 30th DEADLINE, BUT NOW BECAUSE OF THE RULES THAT, YOU KNOW, NOVEMBER BALLOT UNFORTUNATELY DOESN'T QUALIFY, IT WILL COME LATER. HOWEVER YOU VOTE TONIGHT, IT WILL HAPPEN. IT WILL BE VETOPROOF FROM THE MAYOR BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE CITIZEN DRIVEN, MUCH LIKE THE LIBRARY LOT QUESTION WAS. SOREY THAT WE MADE PEOPLE JUMP THROUGH THESE HOOPS TO HAVE -- TO ALLOW DEMOCRACY TO TAKE PLACE IN OUR CITY, BUT THAT'S CLEARLY, YOU KNOW, WHAT WE ARE DEALING WITH. IT'S UNFORTUNATE -- IT DOESN'T SPEAK WELL OF OUR COMMUNITY AND IT DOESN'T SPEAK WELL OF OUR INTEREST IN ENCOURAGING DIVERSITY, PARTICIPATION, ENFRANCHISING PEOPLE WHO ARE DISENFRANCHISED, AND THERE ARE A LOT OF THEM. HAVING ELECTIONS WHEN MORE PEOPLE CAN VOTE AND PARTICIPATE. WE NEED TO AIM A LOT, LOT HIGHER. AND I THANK MY SEVEN COLLEAGUES FOR SUPPORTING AND AIMING -- SUPPORTING -- PLACING THIS QUESTION ON THE BALLOT AND ALLOWING PEOPLE TO WEIGH IN ON THIS QUESTION FOR TRUSTING PEOPLE. THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID WITH YOUR VOTE.
02:52:55.153: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, RAMLAWI AND BANNISTER.
02:52:58.123: >> Councilmember Hayner: BEFORE I ADDRESS A FEW LITTLE NOTES I HERE, I WILL SUGGEST THAT YOU WILL FIND TWO CHARTER QUESTIONS ON THE 2020 BALLOT. THE FIRST ONE IS GOING TO BE TO CHANGE THE CITY CHARTER TO ALLOW FOR NONPARTISAN ELECTIONS. AND THE SECOND ONE IS GOING TO BE CHANGE THE CITY CHARTER TO REMOVE THE VETO POWER OF THE MAYOR WHICH IS AN UNUSUAL THING IN OUR CITY. AND I COULDN'T BRING THAT TO THIS TABLE, ALTHOUGH I KNOW I COULD GET SEVEN VOTES BECAUSE SURELY HE WOULD VETO THAT BUT YOU DIDN'T EVEN HAVE THE DECENCY TO RESPOND TO MY EMAIL WHEN I SAID THAT TO YOU, MAYOR. WHY I REACH OUT TO ANY OF YOUR COLLEAGUES THAT ARE PERHAPPING PROPPINGYOU. YOU SAID THAT THIS WILL EMPOWER MONEY. SOMEHOW PART PARTISAN ELECTIONSS GOING TO EMPOWER MONEY. YOU HAVE $20,000 FROM SOUTH-OF-TOWN REAL ESTATE LAWYERS? WHAT DOES THAT TELL ME ABOUT EMPOWERING MONEY? YOU TOLD ME LAST WEEK THAT THE GOLDEN TICKET WILL BE THE ENDORSEMENT OF THE LOCAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND COUNCILWOMAN GRAND, YOU JUST SAID THE SAME THING, THAT YOU WOULD HATE TO SEE THAT HAPPEN. YOU DOPPLER RADAR WANT TO EMPOWER THE LOCAL PARTY TO -- TO GIVE THAT VERIFICATION. WELL, WE HAVE SEEN THAT, YOU BROKE THE PARTY RULES WHEN YOU SHOWED UP AT THE WASHTENAW DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND YOU SIGNED ON THAT DAY TO BRING ALL OF YOUR SOCIALISTS OUT THIS TO WITHHOLD BY ENFORCEMENT AND HOLD UP YOUR LITTLE WHITE CARDS AGAINST ME. AND I WAS PROUD TO NOT HAVE THE ENDORSEMENT OF THOSE ESTABLISHMENT DEMS HERE IN THIS TOWN. I DIDN'T NEED IT AND I DIDN'T WANT IT. DON'T TELL ME THAT IT'S A GOLDEN TICKET. YOU ENDORSED SOMEBODY AGAINST ME WHO WAS A FORMER REGISTERED REPUBLICAN WHO HASN'T VOTED IN 12 YEARS. THERE'S YOUR DEMOCRATS FOR YOU. THAT'S SOMEONE RUNNING WITH A D. YOU PUT A D IN FRONT OF YOUR NAME, AND YOU MIGHT VOTE FOR JEFFREY EPSTEIN BY MISTAKE. ARE ALL Ds ALIKE? IS THAT WHAT WE ARE SEEING HERE? CLEARLY NOT. AND THE IDEA THAT WE HAVE TO WORK HARD TO GET THAT EIGHTH VOTE IS TRUE. IT'S TRUE. WE DON'T HAVE THE LEISURE TO APPOINT SOMEONE TO THIS SEAT AS THE VOTE TO SELL THE LIBRARY LOT, AS YOU DID COUNCIL MAYOR AND COUNCIL COLLEAGUES. WE HAVE TO EARN THAT EIGHTH VOTE. THAT'S WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT HERE. IF I SOUND ANGRY, IT'S BECAUSE I AM. BECAUSE YOU ARE STIFFING THE PEOPLE, AND THIS IDEA THAT 2019 IS  A LOW TURNOUT. THAT'S NOT HOW YOU GROW A BALLOT. YOU GROW TURNOUT BY PUTTING INTERESTING THINGS ON THERE AND THEN BEATING PUSHES TO GET PEOPLE OUT THIS TO VOTE FOR THEM. AND THE SCHOOL IS NOT GOING TO DO THAT ON THEIR BILLION DOLLARS BOND BECAUSE THE ONLY PEOPLE THEY WANT OUT THERE VOTING FOR IT ARE THE TEACHERS. SO IT PASSES. BUT I'M HAPPILY GOING TO DO THAT OR HAPPILY WOULD HAVE BEEN DOING THAT FOR THIS RESOLUTION. AND SO THAT'S HOW YOU BUILD TURNOUT. NOT BY WAITING AROUND FOR A BIG YEAR AND THROWING ALL OF YOUR STUFF AT THAT GIANT BALLOT. BY PUTTING ON OFF-YEAR ELECTION AND HUSTLING TO GET PEOPLE TO SHOW UP. THAT'S LEADERSHIP AND THAT'S GROWING VOTER PARTICIPATION. IT'S EXACT OPPOSITE OF WHAT YOU ARE DOING. EXACT OPPOSITE. I'M HAPPY TO BE UPSET HERE ABOUT THIS, BECAUSE IT'S UPSETTING. IT'S UPSETTING TO A LOCAL COMMUNITIES OF PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF THIS ROOM. --  UPSETTING TO A LOT OF PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF THIS ROOM. I GET LECTURED AT THIS TABLE ABOUT MY VALUES. THEY DON'T LISTEN TO HOW I VOTE. EVERYONE IS TELLING ME I'M ANTIHOUSING, ANTI-THIS, ANTI-THAT. THIS IS THE MAYOR OF NO. THIS IS THE VIE VETO MAYOR. THAT'S ANTI. THAT'S WHAT ANTIIS. YOU MAY FIND THIS PERSONAL AFFRONT OR WHATEVER, BUT THAT'S JUST HOW IT GOES. I MEAN, YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHAT YOU GET -- THAT'S WHAT YOU GET WHEN YOU FLAUNT THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE. I'M SORRY, I'M NOT HERE TO POP UP THE STATUS QUO, I'M HERE TO SPEAK FOR THE PEOPLE AND I SAID ENOUGH AND I CALL THE QUESTION, BUT I KNOW THERE'S OTHERS WAITING.
02:57:18.583: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, BANNISTER AND ACKERMAN.
02:57:21.586: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: WOW! I DON'T KNOW WHAT I CAN SAY THAT HASN'T BEEN SAID ALREADY. I JUST WANT TO USE MY TWO TIMES TO TALK ABOUT THIS. IT'S OBVIOUS IT'S A VERY PASSIONATE ISSUE, ESPECIALLY AMONGST MY NEW COLLEAGUES AND SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN HERE AS LONG AS COUNCILMEMBER LUMM. THIS RESOLUTION IS ABOUT TO OVERRIDE THE VETO, AND THE FACT THAT THAT VETO POWER IS BEING ABUSED. WHEN YOU STRIP SEVEN COUNCILMEMBERS WHO HAVE BEEN ELECTED TO SPEAK FOR THE RESIDENTS, YOU HAVE STRIPPED US OF OUR POWER. I GOT SOMETHING, INSTEAD OF GIVING US A RAISE, WE JUST ALL GET UP AND LEAVE AND ALLOW FOR THE MAYOR TO RUN THIS WHOLE CITY IF HE KNOWS WHAT'S BEST. HE CAN GET RID OF A BUNCH OF COUNCILMEMBERS AND JUST HAVE ONE PERSON RUN IT AND WE CAN SAVE A WHOLE LOT OF TIME AND MONEY. THESE MEETINGS WOULD BE OVER IN 4545 MINUTES. SO THIS IS NOT ABOUT WHEN IT'S GOING TO SHOW UP ON THE BALLOT, MY FORMER -- MY FELLOW COLLEAGUE OVER HERE KEEPS STRESSING. AND I AM UPSET WITH MY COLLEAGUE THAT I NORMALLY GET ALONG WITH VERY WELL, EVEN ON ISSUES THAT WE DISAGREE ON, WHEN YOU START CALLING SOMEONE LIKE COUNCILMEMBER LUMM LAZY. AND FRANKLY, THE LEADERSHIP IS BORNE BY ALL OF US. IF YOU FEEL THAT SOMEONE SHOULD HAVE REACHED OUTTA CROSS THE AISLE, IT COULD HAVE BEEN YOU. YOU COULD HAVE -- YOU COULD HAVE REACHED OUT AND OFFERED AN AMENDMENT. SO, YOU KNOW, IT SLICES BOTH WAYS. AND THE MAYOR IS SUPPOSED TO BE A CONSENSUS BUILDER. I DON'T SEE MUCH CONSENSUS GOING ON HERE. I SEE BRIGHT -- REAL BRIGHT WHITE LINES BEING DRAWN. THERE'S LINES IN THE SAND BEING DRAWN. THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE. AND EVERYONE KNOWS IT. THE CITY KNOWS IT. THE COMMUNITY KNOWS IT. MEMBERS ON THE COUNCIL, MEMBERS IN THE AUDIENCE. THERE WILL BE ANOTHER ELECTION AND THAT ELECTION WILL HAVE CONSEQUENCES AS WELL.
02:59:50.502: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
02:59:51.736: >> Councilmember Bannister: I'M NOT GOING TO TRY TO MATCH ALL OF THOSE ELOQUENT COMMENTS BY MY COLLEAGUES. I WILL SAY THAT I HAVE HEARD FROM A LOT OF MY RESIDENTS AND ADVISORS AND THEY HAVE URGED ME TO COSPONSOR AND VOTE YES ON THIS OVERRIDE. SO I WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A COSPONSOR AND I WILL APOLOGIZE TO THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE TO GO OUT AND GATHER THE 5100 SIGNATURES BUT I DO THINK IT WILL GO VERY QUICKLY. BECAUSE THAT IS MY READ ON THE TEMPERATURE OF THE CITIZENS IS THAT THEY ARE ANXIOUS TO GET TO SPEAK ON THIS ISSUE AND BE INCLUDED AND SO -- AND THAT'S ALL. I WOULD JUST LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A COSPONSOR. THANK YOU.
03:00:43.888: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
03:00:45.290: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANKS, MR. MAYOR. THIS CONVERSATION GOT PRETTY UGLY PRETTY QUICKLY. I THINK AT CERTAIN POINTS -- I'M NOT SURE IF I WAS OR WE WERE COMPARED TO A PEDOPHILE, BUT THE --
03:01:04.442: >> Councilmember Hayner: POINT OF ORDER. THERE WAS NO COMPARISON.
03:01:07.012: >> Mayor Taylor: I THINK IT WAS A REFERENCE TO MR. EPSTEIN AND THE EXACT STATEMENT WAS I DON'T KNOW IF I WAS OR WE WERE.
03:01:13.318: >> Councilmember Hayner: OKAY. DON'T PUT WORDS IN MY MOUTH.
03:01:17.522: >> Councilmember Ackerman: SO I WILL KEEP GOING BECAUSE IT'S MY TURN TO SPEAK. BUT I JUST WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE ISSUE AT HAND WHICH IS HOW WE HOLD OUR ELECTIONS. AND, YOU KNOW, IN THE TIME SINCE THIS -- SINCE THIS LAST CONVERSATION, I TOOK IT UPON MYSELF TO TALK TO A HANDFUL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE PROFESSORS BECAUSE I WAS CURIOUS ABOUT THE FACTS. AND I THOUGHT THE CONVERSATIONS WERE INTERESTING. THERE'S NO ONE MIND BEHIND WHETHER OR NOT NONPARTISAN ELECTIONS ARE THE SILVER BULLET TO INCREASING DEMOCRATIC TURNOUT. BUT THERE IS A LOT OF RESEARCH BEHIND WHY HE THIS DON'T WORK. AND THE SIMPLE REASON FOR THAT, AND THE REASON THAT I CAN FEEL CONFIDENT SUPPORTING THE MAYOR'S VETO AND FEEL COMFORTABLE IN MY VOTE IN PRIOR WEEKS IS A SIMPLE FACT IS THAT WHAT MAKES DEMOCRACY WORK IS THE COMPETITIVE NATURE OF IT. IT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE ARE ALMOST IN VIOLENT AGREEMENT ABOUT IS THAT THERE SHOULD BE DIVERSITY OF THOUGHT INJECTED INTO THE DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM, AND AS IT TURNED OUT, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE RESEARCH, IT APPEARS AS THOUGH NONPARTISAN LOCAL ELECTIONS DECREASED THAT COMPETITION THROUGH TWO MAJOR MEANS. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT VO VOTER TURNOUT IN RAW NUMBERS. VOTER TURNOUT IN THE NOVEMBER ELECTIONS IS HIGHER THAN NONPARTISAN ELECTIONS BUT VOTER TURNOUT IS NOT THE ONLY MEASURE BY WHICH A COMPETITIVE ELECTION SHOULD BE CONSIDERED. ANOTHER IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION AND MEASURE IS THE TURNOVER IN INCOUPINCUMBENCY. IN NONPARTISAN ELECTIONS INCUMBENCY IS SAFER. WITHOUT THE IDENTIFIER OF IDEOLOGY OR PARTY AFFILIATION, PEOPLE FALL BACK ON NAME RECOGNITION. AND THE PERSON WITH THE GREATEST NAME RECOGNITION IS THE PERSON WHO HAS MADE THE NEWSPAPER FOR THE LAST TWO TO FOUR YEARS. AND SO THAT -- YOU KNOW, THERE'S ANOTHER CONSIDERATION. THE OTHER CONSIDERATION IS BALLOT ROLLOFF, AND SIMPLY THE FACT THAT AS VOTERS MOVE TO THE NONPARTISAN SECTION, THE TURNOUT -- THE TURNOUT DECREASES DRAMATICALLY AS YOU FLIP THE BALLOT. I THINK TWO, I HAVE POINTED TO A FEW ISSUES. THERE'S THE ISSUE OF ENFRANCHISEMENT, ESPECIALLY OF YOUNGER PEOPLE, AND STUDENTS IN PARTICULAR. IT'S TRUE ONLY ABOUT 10% OF THE STUDENTS ARE ENROLLED IN THE AUGUST MONTHS. AND THAT SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASES STUDENT TURNOUT AND YOU CAN SEE THAT IN PRECINCTS ONE OR TWO, ALL THE WAY AROUND ALL FIVE WARDS. AND I HAVE SAID THIS BEFORE AND I HAVE GOT SOME FEEDBACK THAT IS KIND OF WHAT ABOUT-ISM BUT I POINTED OUT THAT THE WARD SYSTEM INHERENTLY DISENFRANCHISES THE STUDENTS BECAUSE THEY ARE SPECIFICALLY GERRYMANDERED TO DIVIDE THE STUDENT VOICE IN FIVE AND DECREASE THE VOTE AT THIS THE ONLY WAY THAT IT'S MEANINGFUL AND SWAYING AN ELECTION WOULD BE THE MAYOR'S AS IT TURNS OUT BECAUSE IT'S A CITYWIDE VOTE. AND I APPRECIATE THAT AS A WHAT ABOUT-ISM. AIM SI'M SAYING THERE'S THIS FLD SYSTEM AND WE SHOULD NOT FIX ANOTHER. IN THAT SCENARIO, YOU KNOW IN THAT CONTEXT OF WHAT I WAS SAYING, I APPRECIATED A FORMER COLLEAGUE'S PEARLE SPECKIVE THAT THESE AREN'T REFORMS THAT WE SHOULD BE CHERRY PICKING TO PUT ON THE BALLOT, BUT INSTEAD WE SHOULD ENABLE AND CREATE THE SPACE FOR A PUBLIC DESPITING CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT HOLISTIC REFORMS SHOULD WE BE PUTTING FORWARD TO INCREASE THE ENFRANCHISEMENT OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING UNDERREPRESENTED TODAY? AND THE FIRST QUESTION TO ASK IS WHO ARE THE PEOPLE UNDERREPRESENTED TODAY? I HAVE MY THEORIES AND YOU HAVE YOUR THEORIES AND THEY PROBABLY OVERLAP A LOT. I THINK WE NEED A PROCESS AND A STRUCTURE AND A BODY NOT MADE UP OF ELECTED OFFICIALS TO BE MAKING THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS TO PUT TO THE BALLOT. SO I WILL LOO ENV LEAVE IT THERD ON THE SIMPLE MERITS OF THE ORIGINAL VOTE, I WILL BE VOTING AGAINST THIS.
03:05:54.332: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
03:05:57.368: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT THIS VOTE TONIGHT IS NOT ABOUT MAKING A DECISION FOR OR AGAINST NONPARTISAN ELECTIONS. IT IS ABOUT PUTTING THE ISSUE ON THE BALLOT FOR THE PEOPLE TO DECIDE. AND THAT IS WHAT THE MAJORITY OF COUNCILMEMBERS WANTED TO DO AND THAT'S WHAT WE VOTED FOR. SO WE CAN TALK ABOUT ALL OF THESE ACADEMIC ISSUES. WE CAN BRING IN MORE Ph.D.s AND HAVE THEM TALK ABOUT ALL KINDS OF POLITICAL SCIENCE ISSUES BUT RIGHT NOW, THE ISSUE IS VERY SIMPLE. SHOULD THE PUBLIC BE ALLOWED TO DECIDE?
03:06:47.719: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN?
03:06:50.288: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANKS, MR. MAYOR. I RESPECT AND VALUE EXPERTISE AND ALL OF THOSE Ph.D.s THAT YOU SPEAK DOWN TO MAKE UP A BIG, SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE POPULATION OF THIS CITY, AND -- AND THAT'S GREAT. BUT I -- BUT I THINK IT'S -- IT'S GOOD TO ENGAGE THE EXPERTS IN THEIR FIELDS AND THEIR AREAS OF EXPERTISE, WHICH ARE HOW POLITICAL SYSTEMS WORK AND HOW THEY DON'T. AND I WILL HAVE THAT CONVERSATION WITH A POLITICAL SCIENTIST WHEN APPROPRIATE. I WILL HAVE IT WITH A CLIMATE CHANGE SCIENTIST WHEN APPROPRIATE. I WILL HAVE IT WITH -- WITH AN EQUITY EXPERT, SOCIOLOGIST WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATE. I DON'T THINK IT'S PROPER, GOOD TO DEMEAN THAT EXERCISE. THAT'S GOOD RESEARCH AND I'M GLAD TO HAVE DONE IT.
03:07:42.340: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? WELL, AS IS LIKELY OBVIOUS, I'M GOING TO VOTE AGAINST THIS RESOLUTION. I AM -- I'M THE PROBLEM IS NOT SHRINKING IN ANN ARBOR. THEY SAW ABOUT A 75% INCREASE IN PARTICIPATION IN 2018. SECRETARY CLINTON WON ANN ARBOR, IF I RECOLLECTED AROUND 85-15 AND AS A PERSON WHO HAS WON A COUPLE OF CITY-WIDE ELECTIONS, I HAVE SOME SENSE AS TO THE WILL OF ANN ARBOR VOTERS. AND THAT WILL IS CONSISTENT WITH THE VIEWS OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND I THINK THAT'S JUST A SIMPLE FACT. IT'S BEEN SUGGESTED THAT OUR CURRENT SYSTEM DISENFRANCHISES VOTERS ON THE BASIS OF IDEOLOGY. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT TO BE TRUE. REPUBLICANS ARE WELCOME ON THE BALLOT. THEY JUST HAVE TO DECLARE THEMSELVES. I'M NOT GOING TO HELP CANDIDATES DECEIVE ANN ARBOR VOVOTERS ABOUT THEIR VALUE SET. IN MY OPINION, THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT. ITS ABOUT REQUIRING CANDIDATES TO DECLARE THEIR POSITION ON ISSUES OF LOCAL IMPORTANCE AND IDEAL LOGICAL IMPORTANCE AND ISSUES THAT ARE HIGHLY RELEVANT TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AS I DISCUSSED IN MY VETO MESSAGE, I BELIEVE THAT THERE IS, INDEED A REPUBLICAN AND A DEMOCRATIC WAY TO RUN LOCAL GOVERNMENT. THINK ABOUT HOW YOU -- HOW YOU UNDERSTAND THOSE PARTY DIVIDES. HOW WOULD A REPUBLICAN COUNCILMEMBER GENERALLY SPEAKING VIEW THE SUPPORT AND THE EXISTENCE AND EMPOWERMENT OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION? THE EMPOWERMENT AND THE EXISTENCE OF THE INDEPENDENT POLICE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION. HOW WOULD SUCH A PERSON ACT IN SUPPORT OF OUR CLIMATE ACTION PLAN? WOULD THEY SUPPORT THE PROVISION OF $880,000 A YEAR TO EFFECT THE GOALS OF THAT PLAN. WOULD THEY SUPPORT $1.2 MILLION OF DIRECT HUMAN SERVICES FOR ANN ARBOR'S NEEDIEST? ON AND ON AND ON. THOSE ARE AREAS OF REASONABLE PARTISAN CONVERSATION. AND I BELIEVE THAT ANN ARBOR VOTERS HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW WHO THEIR CANDIDATES ARE. I UNDERSTAND THAT PEOPLE DON'T -- THAT PEOPLE WOULD VOTED IN FAVOR OF THIS RESOLUTION DO NOT LIKE THE FACT THAT I HAVE VETOED IT. I HAVE LOST VOTES ON THE MAJORITY OF 7-4 WHEN EIGHT WAS NEEDED. I HAVE LOST VOTES 7-4 WHEN THE EIGHT VOTE RREMENT AROSE AT THE VERY LAST MINUTE BECAUSE OUR RULES ALLOW IT. DID I NOT TAKE INSULT FROM THOSE WHO EXERCISE THEIR THAT AUTHORITY UNDER THE CHARTER. WE ARE ALL ELECTED HERE IN VARIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES. SOME WARD BY WARD, SOME TO REPRESENT THE CITY AS A WHOLE. WE WERE ALL ELECTED AND GIVEN AUTHORITY AND INVESTED WITH THE POWER TO ENTRUST, TO ACT IN FURTHERANCE OF THAT AUTHORITY, WHEN PEOPLE VOTE IN A WAY THAT I DISAGREE WITH, THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE DOING IN GOOD FAITH AND THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING IF GOOD FAITH HERE TODAY. IT'S BEEN SUGGESTED THAT NO ONE HAS COME FORWARD AND SPOKEN IN FAVOR OF THE VETO. I HAVE RECEIVED A HANDFUL OF COMMUNICATIONS. I DON'T CLAIM TO HAVE RECEIVED A TON. THEY HAVE SWUNG BOTH WAYS. THE ONLY ORGANIZATION THAT HAS COME AND SPOKEN TO ME ABOUT THE -- ABOUT THE VETO IN SUPPORT OF THE -- AND THE ORGANIZATION WHICH CAME OUT IN SUPPORT OF THE VETO AND AS I UNDERSTAND IT UNANIMOUSLY AND COMMUNICATED THAT SUPPORT THIS COUNCIL, WAS THE HURON VALLEY AERIAL LABOR FEDERATION, AN IMPORTANT VOICE IN OUR COMMUNITY. IN THE END, I BELIEVE THAT THE INTRODUCTION OF NONPARTISAN ELECTIONS TO ANN ARBOR WOULD CLOUD THE ELECTORATE. IT WOULD REMOVE FROM THE VOTERS IMPORTANT CRUCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT CANDIDATE VALUE SETS. YOU KNOW, OUR FORM OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS NOT PERFECT. THERE ARE PLAIN AND OBVIOUS WAYS -- THERE ARE PLAIN AND OBVIOUS DEFECTS. THIS CHANGE, HOWEVER, IN MY VIEW WILL AUGMENT THOSE DEFECTS. IT WILL NOT ADDRESS THEM OR SOLVE THEM. AS A CONSEQUENCE, I VETOED THE RESOLUTION. PARDON ME, I VETOED THE INITIAL RESOLUTION AND I WILL VOTE AGAINST THIS EFFORT TO OVERRIDE. FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER EATON?
03:12:42.973: >> Councilmember Eaton: THANK YOU. THREE MICHIGAN CITIES HAVE PARTISAN ELECTIONS. IONIA WITH A POPULATION OF 11,000 PEOPLE. AND  YPSILANTI OF 21,000 AND ANN ARBOR. NONPARTISAN ELECTIONS WORK FOR EVERY OTHER CITY IN THIS STATE. WE AREN'T TODAY DECIDING WHETHER OR NOT TO HAVE PARTISAN ELECTIONS BUT RATHER WE ARE DECIDING WHETHER OR NOT TO ALLOW VOTERS OF ANN ARBOR TO DECIDE THAT QUESTION. I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S A CONCERN ABOUT A LOW TURNOUT IN NOVEMBER OF 2019, BUT IF THIS IS NOT PUT ON THAT BALLOT, WE WILL COLLECT SIGNATURES AND IT WILL BE ON THE AUGUST 2020 BALLOT WITHOUT AN ENORMOUS TURNOUT EITHER. THOSE ARE THE CHOICES THAT WE HAVE. BECAUSE WE DON'T TRUST THAT AT THIS TIME NEXT YEAR, WE WILL HAVE EIGHT VOTES TO OVERCOME A VETO TO PUT IT ON THE 2020 NOVEMBER BALLOT. IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE TRUST THIS BODY TO COME TO TERMS WITH IN ONE YEAR. WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT PARTISANSHIP ACTUALLY HELPS VOTERS BE LAZY. IN THE NOT SO DISTANT PAST, ANN ARBOR COUNCILMEMBERS WHO HAD RUN AS REPUBLICANS JUST SIMPLY CHANGED THEIR PARTY TO DEMOCRAT. AND THEN THEY WON THE NOVEMBER ELECTIONS BECAUSE THEY HAD THE D NEXT TO THEIR NAME, NOT BECAUSE THEY CHANGED THEIR POSITION ON ANY ISSUE AT ALL. IN REALITY, IN ANN ARBOR, BECAUSE SO MANY VOTERS ARE DEMOCRATS, WE WILL TYPICALLY HAVE TWO COUNCILMEMBERS WHO ARE VOTE DEMOCRATS RUNNING AGAINST EACH OTHER AND OUR CHOICE WILL BE TO HAVE 3,000 PEOPLE DETERMINE WHICH DEMOCRAT WILL REPRESENT THEM IN AUGUST, OR 10,000 PEOPLE DECIDE THAT SAME ISSUE IN NOVEMBER. NOW, AS A LIFELONG DEMOCRAT AND AN INCUMBENT, I WOULD BENEFIT FROM PARTISAN ELECTIONS IN 2020 WHEN I'M UP FOR REELECTION. BUT THIS ISN'T ABOUT ME. IT'S ABOUT GIVING VOTERS -- ALL OF THE VOTERS, ESPECIALLY THAT PORTION OF OUR CITY THAT ARE STUDENTS THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN OUR LOCAL ELECTIONS AND HAVE A SAY. YOU CAN SAY THAT STUDENTS AREN'T GOING TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON ANY RACE OTHER THAN THE MAYORAL RACE AND THAT'S SIMPLY UNTRUE. AS CLOSE AS OUR COUNCIL RACES ARE THESE DAYS, STUDENTS CAN ACTUALLY FORM AN AGENDA, ASK US WHAT WE BELIEVE ON THEIR ISSUES AND THEN BE THE DECIDING VOTES IN DETERMINING WHO REPRESENTS THEM ON COUNCIL. I NOTE THAT IN THE MAYOR'S MEMO TO US, EXPLAINING HIS VETO, HE SAID THAT THERE ARE SOME ISSUES THAT ARE PA PARTISAN, SUCH HAVIG ACE POLICE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION. THE MAYOR WORKED WITH THE ONLY NON-DEMOCRAT ON COUNCIL TO WATER DOWN THE POLICE OVERSIGHT ORDINANCE TO ITS CURRENT STATE. I'M NOT SURE THAT THAT WAS A GOOD EXAMPLE TO USE. ON THE OTHER HAND, I BELIEVE DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS IN THIS CITY ARE ALL ENVIRONMENTALISTS, AND WHEN WE FAIL TO TAKE CARE OF OUR SEWERS, WE END UP DUMPING HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF GALLONS OF RAW SEWAGE INTO THE RIVER BECAUSE WE DON'T TAKE CARE OF THE BASICS. THERE ARE ISSUES THAT ARE SO FUNDAMENTAL TO JUST RUNNING A GOVERNMENT. RECYCLING, SEWERS, STREETS, THAT WE'RE NOT DOING A VERY GOOD JOB ON. AND IT'S BECAUSE 3,000 PEOPLE IN AUGUST PICK COUNCILMEMBERS RATHER THAN PUTTING IT TO THE ENTIRE POPULATION IN NOVEMBER. I, OF COURSE, WILL BE SUPPORTING THE OVERRIDE. VETO AND I WISH THAT SOMEONE WOULD CHANGE THEIR VOTE SO THAT WE CAN ASK VOTES IF THEY SUPPORT THIS OR NOT. THANK YOU..
03:17:15.379: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE. STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.

03:17:46.877: >> Mayor Taylor: DC-4, MOTION RESOLUTION TO REJECT THE DETERMINATION OF SALARIES FOR THE PAYER AND CITY COUNCILMEMBERS APPROVED BY THE LOCAL OFFICERS COMPENSATION COMMISSION ON JUNE 17th. MOVED AND SECONDED. COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
03:18:02.192: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THIS IS A GOOD ONE TO MAKE NO FRIENDS ON. THANK YOU, MAYOR. I WANT TO FIRST THANK THE LOCAL OFFICERS COMPENSATION COMMISSION FOR RAISES FOR THIS BODY. I WANT TO PUT THIS FORWARD FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT AS A BODY, WE DISCUSS AND VOTE ON RAISES FOR NEARLY EVERY OTHER CITY EMPLOYEE FROM THE FIREFIGHTER TO THE CITY ATTORNEY. AND THIS REPRESENTS A 37% RAISE FOR CITY COUNCIL, AND I THINK THAT DESERVES DISCUSSION AND A VOTE. I THINK BEFORE I'M QUIET, I DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT MAY BE EASIER FOR ME THAN OTHERS TO TURN THIS DOWN. I'M YOUNG. I'M A PROFESSIONAL AND I REALIZE THAT $5,000 TO $6,000 IN THE COURSE OF A YEAR CAN MAKE A VERY REAL DIFFERENCE FOR SOMEONE LIVING ON THE EDGE. AND -- BUT I DO -- I WANT TO CHALLENGE US MORE. AND IF WE WANT TO MAKE DIVERSITY AT THIS TABLE BY AGE AND BY INCOME, MORE ACCESSIBLE, THEN I THINK WE NEED TO BE EXAMINING OUR SALARY SYSTEMS, WHICH WE ARE, AND THIS IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. BUT I DO WANT TO CHALLENGE HOW WE LOOK AT THOSE SYSTEMS, A FLAT RAISE TO $23,000 DOESN'T OPEN THE DOOR TO MANY MORE PEOPLE. AND I WANT US -- ARE OR THE LOCC, TO EXAMINE THE SYSTEM, ON A SLIDING SCALE BASED ON NEED BUT START THAT EXPLORATION THAT WOULD ACHIEVE AN EQUITABLE PLAYING FIELD AND ENABLE US TO DO HIGH QUALITY WORK AND SERVICE FOR THE PEOPLE. FOR ME TONIGHT, I CAN'T VOLT VOTEFOR A RAISE FOR MYSELF ON PRINCIPLE. SO UNFORTUNATELY, I CAN'T VOTE FOR A RAISE FOR ALL OF YOU EITHER. THANKS.
03:19:59.443: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
03:20:02.946: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I ACTUALLY -- I THINK THAT -- IT IS -- 37% IS A LOT, I AGREE. BUT I DISAGREE WITH THE STATEMENT THAT IT DOESN'T OPEN THE DOOR TO MANY PEOPLE, BECAUSE THAT'S -- NOW WE ARE TALKING ABOUT LOW WAGE JOB. I MEAN, IT'S A LOW-WAGE JOB, BELIEVE IT OUT THI THERE IN THE AUDIENCE. IT DEPENDS ON HOW MANY HOURS YOU DO IT. IT DOESN'T PAY THE BILLS. I NOTICED SOMETHING THIS WEEK, AND I WAS REALLY IN TUNED TO THIS. I HAVE NOTICED THAT OVER THE LAST SEVEN MONTHS OR SO, EIGHT MONTHS, I HAVE NOT BEEN TAKING THE TAPES OF JO  JOBS THAT I HAN THE PAST. I HAD A CUSTOMER SAYING I HAVE A TWO AND A HALF HOUR JOB, CAN YOU COME OVER AND DO IT? I CAN'T BECAUSE I BOOKED STUFF OUT. SO I HAVE XED OUT THINGS BECAUSE I HAVE A MEETING HERE, I MEETING THERE AND I HAVE TO READ THIS OR THAT AND DO MY COUNCIL BUSINESS WHICH I'M FAIRLY COMPENSATED FOR NOW. I HAVE NOTICED THAT IT HAS CHANGED MY WORK HABITS AS AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR. AND SO I -- I DON'T KNOW IF I WILL SUPPORT THIS OR NOT. YOU KNOW, I'M KIND OF TORN ABOUT IT BECAUSE TO BE HONEST, I COULD USE THE MONDAY. AND IT IS AN EQUITY ISSUE IN MANY WAYS. 16 ISN'T MUCH. 24 IS A LITTLE BETTER. YOU KNOW, 24 IS $12 AN HOUR JOB FOR, YOU KNOW -- I MEAN THAT HE IS NOT SO TERRIBLE. THAT'S A STARTING WAGE AT KROGER OR SOME PLACE LIKE THAT. SO IT'S AS IF IT COULD BE A FULL-TIME JOB FOR SOMEONE. AND BELIEVE ME, IF SOMEBODY WAS DIGGING INTO THIS AS A FULL-TIME JOB, YOU WOULD HAVE SOME AWESOME REPRESENTATION, IF THEY WERE WORKING SOLELY ON THIS, NOT -- WE ALL DO THIS FULL-TIME, BUT WE ALSO HAVE OTHER JOBS, AND I THINK WOULD YOU HAVE SOME INTERESTING REPRESENTATION. AND SO I KNOW MY COLLEAGUE MS. BANNISTER WANTS TO SAY A FEW THINGS ABOUT IT. SHE OPENS MY EYES TO THE EQUITY ISSUES. I HAVE NOTICED THAT IT -- IT -- I HAVE SUBSTITUTED MY TRADES WORK FOR MY CITY COUNCIL WORK, TO THE DETRIMENT OF MY BOTTOM LINE. BUT IT'S PUBLIC SERVICE. IT'S IN THE NAME. AND SO I APPRECIATE COUNCILMAN ACKERMAN BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND I'M GOING TO MULL IT OVER WHILE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IT. I'M ON THE EDGE ON THIS ONE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK. I -- YOU KNOW, PEOPLE DON'T GET INTO THIS FOR THE MONEY, OBVIOUSLY. BUT IT DOESN'T HURT IF YOU ARE A -- YOU KNOW, A SINGLE FAMILY, YOU KNOW A SINGLE PARENT OR SOMETHING, AND YOU ARE SPENDING ALL OF THIS TIME ON COUNCIL BUSINESS. THAT CAN MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN SOMEBODY'S LIFE. MY FOLKS WERE HERE EARLIER. MY DAD IS KIND OF OLD-FASHIONED INVESTOR GUY. THEY COME DOWN FOR THE KIDS' ART FAIR. THEY WERE SITTING OVER THERE. I TALKED TO MY DAD ABOUT THIS. MY DAD SAID I SHOULD JUST SHUT UP AND TAKE IT AND ASK MR. CRAWFORD TO TAKE THE DIFFERENCE AND PUT IT IN MY ROTH I.R.A. TO INVEST SO I HAVE INVESTED IN MYSELF, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO SALARIES AND PRETEND LIKE I NEVER GOT IT AND INVEST IN MY ROTH FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS OR WHATEVER TO MAKE UP FOR WHAT I'M NOT PUTTING IN FOR MY SELF-EMPLOYMENT TAX. AND THAT'S SOME PRETTY DECENT ADVICE I THOUGHT FROM AS OLD-FASHIONED MONEY MANAGER TYPE. HE'S JUST A MILLWRIGHT BUT HE DID GOOD WITH HIS MONEY, YOU KNOW? I'M NOT SURE WHERE I SIT ON THIS, BUT I WON'T BE -- I ASSURE YOU,F I GET THIS RAISE, I WILL BE INVESTING IN MY FUTURE AND I WILL POUR SOME BACK INTO THE COMMUNITY TOO, BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT DRIVES ME CRAZY ABOUT OUR HIGH PROPERTY TAXES, THE TAX FOR THIS AND TAX FOR THAT. EVERY DOLLAR THAT THE CITY THAT THEY WANT TO SPEND ON PUBLIC ART, IT'S A DOLLAR I CAN'T SPEND ON KIDS' PUBLIC HART. EVERY DOLLAR THE CITY SAYS THEY WANT TO SPEND ON SOMETHING, IT'S COMING OUT OF MY MONEY, MONEY I CAN'T PUT BACK IN THE COMMUNITY IN WAYS I SEE FIT. I ASSURE YOU IF I GET THIS, I WILL CONTINUE TO DO WORK AND I GUESS I WILL DO 37% MORE WORK. AND IT'S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE THAT I COULD DO THAT. I THINK WE ALL -- SOME OF US GOOD. I KNOW ANNE WORKS SUPER HARD. IF THIS PASSES OR IF THIS FAILS, I WILL DO 35% MORE WORK. THANK YOU.
03:24:29.413: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
03:24:31.882: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, MAYOR TAYLOR. YES, LOOKING AT THIS WHEN IT FIRST CAME UP, I APPRECIATE COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN'S SENTIMENTS.
03:24:40.690: >> YOU WOULD BE WILLING TO DO THIS AS A PUBLIC SERVICE, AND THE COMMUNITY GOOD. I THINK BY AND LARGE, MANY MEMBERS UP HERE FEEL THAT SAME WAY. WE ARE NOT DOING THIS BECAUSE OF THE PAY CHECK. SO I APPRECIATE THE SOURCE THIS IS COMING FROM, BUT YOU ALSO KNOW THAT NOT EVERYONE IS AS FORTUNATE AS WE ARE. AND IT COULD PE OTHERS FROM PARTICIPATING IN CITY GOVERNMENT, WHERE THIS MIGHT BE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BEING ABLE TO AFFORD CHILD CARE, BEING ABLE TO AFFORD HEALTH INSURANCE AND I WOULD CAUTION AGAINST SETTING THE FIGURE SO LOW THAT ONLY RETIREES AND THE WELL-TO-DO AND THE WELL-CONNECTED ARE INVOLVED IN CITY POLITICS, BECAUSE OF THE TIME COMMITMENT THAT COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER HAS TALKED ABOUT, THE OPPORTUNITY COSTS OF SITTING HERE. THERE IS GREAT OPPORTUNITY COSTS FOR US WHEN WE ARE -- WHEN WE CAN'T DO OTHER THINGS IN OUR LIFE BECAUSE OF THE COMMITMENTS WE MADE HERE. AGAIN, I'M FORTUNATE THAT IF THIS RAISE COMES OR DOESN'T COME, I WILL BE LIVING IN THE SAME HOUSE, EATING THE SAME FOOD, DRIVING THE SAME CAR. IT'S NOT GOING TO M MAKE A DIFFERENCE. BUT I WANT TO KEEP IN PLACE COMPENSATION FOR THOSE WHO MAYBE ARE LESS FORTUNATE, OR HAVE MORE DEMANDS FOR THEM TO PARTICIPATE IN CITY GOVERNMENT. I FEEL WE ARE IN -- YOU KNOW, WE ARE IN DANGER OF LOSING THAT CONNECTION WITH THE ORDINARY CITIZEN IN THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY AND THIS WOULD BE ANOTHER STEP IN MAKING THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY MORE DISTANT FROM THE EVERY DAY CITIZEN. IF WE WERE GOING TO TAKE THIS MONEY AND RELATIVELY DIRECT IT FOR A COUNCIL ADMINISTRATOR, AN ASSISTANT TO HELP US WITH CONSTITUENT SERVICES, I WOULD BE SUPPORTIVE OF THAT. BUT I FEEL EITHER THIS BODY, OR THE COMMUNITY DESERVES THE SUPPORT THAT COMES WITH THE RAISE THAT WAS GIVEN. AND THE DANGER OF SAYING NO TO THAT GREATLY OUTWEIGHS THE IMPACT IT HAS ON OUR BUDGET. SO FOR THAT REASON, I CANNOT SUPPORT THIS, BUT I DO APPRECIATE THE SPIRIT THAT BROUGHT IT TO THIS TABLE.
03:27:27.057: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
03:27:28.191: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN FOR PUTTING THIS ON THE AGENDA. AS THE GENERAL PUBLIC UNDERSTANDS THE WAY THE COMPENSATION WORKS IN TERMS OF RAISES FOR MAYOR AND COUNCILMEMBERS IS THAT THIS JUST AUTOMATICALLY HAPPENS. THESE RAISES WITHOUT A VOTE, AND THAT OBVIOUSLY DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT. SO UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOUR POSITION IS, THERE OUGHT TO BE AT LEAST A PUBLIC VOTE AND DISCUSSION AND SO I'M GLAD WE ARE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION. THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN FOR PUTTING THIS ON TONIGHT AND THANKS AS WELL TO THE FOLKS WOULD SERVED ON THE ANN ARBOR LOCAL OFFICERS COMPENSATION COMMISSION. CLEARLY THEY DID THEIR HOMEWORK AND RESEARCH AND IT'S APPRECIATED. I HAVE MIXED VIEWS ON THIS. AND I DO UNDERSTAND AND AGREE WITH THE ARGUMENTS ON BOTH SIDES. I THINK THE PRIMARY ARGUMENT FOR ACCEPTING THE COUNCIL RAISES IS THAT WE DON'T WANT THE COMPENSATION LEVEL TO PREVENT FOLKS FROM PARTICIPATING. THERE'S OBVIOUSLY REAL OPPORTUNITY COSTS HERE THAT -- THAT FOLKS -- SOME FOLKS, YOU KNOW, ARE CONFRONTING AND THAT'S -- YOU KNOW, SO THAT'S CERTAINLY A VALID ARGUMENT. BUT I WILL SAY THAT I'M NOT SURE ABOUT $17,000 A YEAR OR $23,000 A YEAR WILL REALLY MOVE THE NEEDLE MUCH IN TERMS OF PARTICIPATION, AND THIS IS ABOUT PUBLIC SERVICE, BUT IT CAN'T HURT. WHAT I'M NOT SURE ABOUT IS WHETHER PEGGING COUNCIL COMPENSATION AT 50% OF THE MAYOR'S IS APPROPRIATE. THERE ARE MANY DEMANDS ON THE MAYOR'S TIME, THAT INDIVIDUAL COUNCILMEMBERS DO NOT HAVE, AND WHETHER 50% OF THE MAYOR'S SALARY MAKES SENSE OR NOT, I CERTAINLY DON'T THINK IT'S NECESSARY TO MAKE THAT HAM IN ONE YEAR. THE RESULT OF MAKING THAT KIND OF AN ADJUSTMENT TO HALF THE MAYOR'S SALARY AND IMMEDIATELY A 37% INCREASE TORE COUNCILMEMBERS AND I -- FOR COUNCILMEMBERS AND I THINK THAT'S TOO MUCH TO TAKE. IT'S TOO GENEROUS. SO FOR ME, I DON'T THINK THIS 37% INCREASE IS REASONABLE. I KNOW IT'S NOT A HUGE SUM OF MONEY. YOU KNOW, IT'S STILL A $60,000 INCREASE IN GENERAL FUND COSTS. AGAIN, SO I SEE BOTH SIDES OF THIS. SO I'M NOT GOING TO DISPARAGE OR CRITICIZE ANYONE WHO VOTES FOR THE RAISES. FOR ME, THE MAGNITUDE OF THE INCREASE AT 37%, THE 37% INCREASE IS, I THINK, JUST TOO MUCH. IT'S BEYOND WHAT I THINK IS REASONABLE. SO WE WILL REJECT THE RAISES, AND GOING FORWARD, MY ADVICE TO THE LOCAL OFFICERS COMPENSATION COMMISSION WOULD BE, YOU KNOW, IN THE FUTURE, IF THERM TO PHASE IN INCREASES, THAT -- THAT I MIGHT FEEL DIFFERENTLY AND TAKE A DIFFERENT VIEW ON THAT. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ONE FELL SWOOP OF A 37% INCREASE AND THAT'S JUST -- IT JUST DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT TO ME. THANKS.
03:30:52.128: >> Mayor Taylor: I'M GOING TO VOTE AGAINST THE RESOLUTION THAT'S IN SUPPORT OF THE COMMISSION'S RECOMMENDATION AS I STATED FROM THE OUTSET OF THIS PROCESS. I WILL DO WHATEVER THE COMPENSATION COMMISSION SUGGESTS WITHOUT REGARD TO ITS -- WHICH WAY IT TOGGLES. IF THEY CHOSE TO DOUBLE OUR SALARIES, I WOULD SUPPORT IT. IF THEY CHOSE TO HAVE OUR SALARIES, I WOULD SUPPORT IT. I BELIEVE IN TURNING THIS QUESTION OVER TO THEM AND SUPPORTING THEM IN WHATEVER THEY DO. THEY WILL HAVE MADE THIS DECISION TO TICK UP THE MAYOR'S SALARY AND TO SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE THE COUNCILMEMBER'S SALARIES. THEY MADE THAT DECISION. I'M GOOD WITH IT. I'M GOOD WITH IT BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT ABOUT IT CAREFULLY AND WE HAVE ENTRUSTED THE DECISION TO THEM AND I'M GOING TO BACK IT UP. COUNCILMEMBER GRAND AND THEN GRISWOLD AND THEN PERHAPS WE CAN MOVE FORWARD.
03:31:44.147: >> Councilmember Grand: I DON'T MUCH MORE TO ADD TO THAT. I WANTED TO SPEAK TO THE GOOD WORK OF THE LOCC AND I HAVE SUPPORTED THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS EVERY YEAR THAT I HAVE BEEN ON COUNCIL. I WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS GOING FORWARD. I DO APPRECIATE SOME OF THE CONCERNS ABOUT EQUITY THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP AT THIS TABLE. ONE THING THAT HASN'T, THAT WOULD POSSIBLY MAKE ME GO THE OTHER WAY IS THE FLIP SIDE OF THAT WHICH IS ABOUT OVER PROFESSIONALIZATION OF INCREASING THE SALARY TO THE POINT WHERE IT WOULD SEEM INAPPROPRIATE TO HAVE ANOTHER JOB. WHILE DOING THIS JOB AND I DON'T WANT -- I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR TO HAVE THE EXPECTATION BE THAT YOU CAN'T HOLD ANOTHER JOB. I CERTAINLY HAVE MADE CHOICES ABOUT HAVING A JOB THAT AT THE BEGINNING  PART TIME, SO THAT I COULD GET THAT LEARNING CURVE UP AND I HAD THE LUXURY OF DOING THAT WHEN MY KIDS WERE SMALLER AND THEN TAKING A FULL-TIME JOB AND ONE THAT WAS RELATIVELY CONTAINED AND SUPPORTIVE OF THIS WORK. BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE ON COUNCIL, THAT IT DOESN'T INCREASE TO A POINT WHERE IT WOULD BE WORK AND IT WOULD BE LOOKED AT IRRESPONSIBLE OR LOOKED DOWN UPON FOR ALSO HAVING PROFESSIONS. I THINK HAVING PEOPLE IN THIS -- AT THIS TABLE WITH DIFFERENT PROFESSIONAL BACKGROUNDS, STRENGTHENS WHAT WE BRING IN TERMS OFUR DECISION MAKING BY HAVING DIFFERENT PEARLE SPECKIVES. YOU KNOW, I -- I THINK IT WORKS OUT ABOUT PERCENTAGE-WISE, THAT I -- SINCE THEY HAVE BEEN TRASHED SO MUCH. I'M THE ONLY PERSON WITH A Ph.D. AND THAT'S 10%. I THINK IT HELPS ME MAKE DECISION. I WOULD HATE TO LOCAL LOCAL LOST THIS TABLE.
03:33:44.434: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
03:33:45.335: >> Councilmember Griswold: MY PRIMARY ISSUE IS GREATER DIVERSITY, AND NOT HAVING THE RATE SET SO LOW THAT IT'S AN OBSTACLE FOR ANYONE WHO MIGHT WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN PUBLIC SERVICE. I WAS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF THE INCREASE AND I TALKED TO A MEMBER OF THE COMMISSION AND FOUND OUT THAT THIS WAS A UNANIMOUS DECISION AND I HAVE ALSO MENTIONED TONIGHT, DATA-DRIVEN DECISIONS AND THAT'S WHAT THIS WAS. THEY LOOKED AT THE AVERAGE TIME OF COUNCILMEMBERS AND THE TIME THAT THE MAYOR ESTIMATED THAT HE SPENT AND IT WAS VERY SIMILAR IN TERMS OF THE AMOUNT OF TIME. AND SO THAT'S WHY THEY THOUGHT IT SHOULD BE RAISED TO HALF OF WHAT THE MAYOR WAS MAKING. SO I WILL SUPPORT THE DECISION OF THE COMMISSION, AND I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH WAYS TO WORK SMARTER AND NOT HARDER. WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED THE A2FIXIT SYSTEM, AND WE HAVE SOME OTHER AUTOMATION. WE ALSO INTO ED TO LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF COMMUNICATIONS THAT WE'RE GETTING FROM CONSTITUENTS BECAUSE THEY ARE UNHAPPY WITH WHAT'S HAPPENED BE IT THEY JUST MISUNDERSTAND OR THEY DIDN'T GET THE SERVICE THAT THEY EXPECTED. AND SO CAN WE LOOK AT GOING BACK DOWN THAT COMMUNICATION STREAM AND SEE IF WE CAN IMPROVE THE SYSTEM SO THAT OUR WORKLOAD IS REDUCED SO THAT WE DON'T EXPECT OR -- THERE AREN'T JUSTIFICATION. SORRY, IT'S GETTING LATE. BUT THERE IS NOT JUSTIFICATION FOR THESE HUGE INCREASES GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU.
03:35:33.509: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
03:35:34.710: >> Councilmember Eaton: THANK YOU. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE LOCC FOR THE WORK THAT THEY HAVE PUT INTO THIS. THEY DID A GOOD JOB. THEY EXPLAINED THE RESULTS VERY WELL. IN THE PAST, I HAVE TYPICALLY VOTED AGAINST RAISES. I DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE GIVING MYSELF A RAISE. ON THE OTHER HAND, LIKE COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN, I'M ECONOMICALLY PRIVILEGED. I COULD DO THIS FOR FREE. I DON'T NEED THIS MONEY. BUT I DON'T THINK THAT'S TRUE ABOUT EVERYBODY. AND I THINK THAT FOR SOME PEOPLE WOULD WOULD LIKE TO SERVE, THEY REALLY DO HAVE TO WORK LESS OR EARN LESS IN THEIR OTHER CAPACITIES IN ORDER TO PUT THE TIME THAT THIS DEMANDS. SO I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THE RECOMMENDATIONS BECAUSE I SUPPORT PAYING ENOUGH TO ENCOURAGE OTHERS TO SERVE AS WELL WOULD Y WITHOUT REGARD TO I NEED OR WHAT MY CIRCUMSTANCES ARE. AND SO I WILL BE VOTING AGAINST THIS RESOLUTION.
03:36:37.039: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTERS.
03:36:38.274: >> Councilmember Bannister: I WANT TO SAY ONE THING THAT HASN'T BEEN SAID. NOT ONLY ARE WE WORKING A LOT ON COUNCIL BUSINESS, WE ARE ALSO SPENDING A LOT OF MONEY BECAUSE WE ATTEND A WHOLE BUNCH OF THE LOCAL NONPROFITS EVENTS, AND SO THE DINNERS, THE MUSEUM DINNERS AND THE EVENTS AND SO IT'S PART OF OUR CODE OF ETHICS THAT WE DON'T GO FOR FREE. SO WE'RE SHELLING OUT $100 REGULARLY FOR THIS, THAT AND THE OTHER EVENT. AND THEN ALSO MEETING WITH RESIDENTS IS A $5 EVENT AT THE COFFEE SHOP OR $15 IF YOU GO FOR A SANDWICH. AND ALSO -- SO WE'RE WORKING SO MUCH TOO, THAT I FIND YOUR TIME TO DO YOUR OWN LAWN CARE AND SNOW REMOVAL CAN BE HAMPERED. SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING GOING WITH THE LOCC'S RECOMMENDATIONS TOO, BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THIS POSITION OF SERVING ON COUNCIL BE OPEN TO EVERYBODY IN THE COMMUNITY AND NOT BE RESTRICTED TO JUST THE PEOPLE WHO CAN AFFORD TO DO IT. THANKS.

03:38:41.197: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WOULD LIKE TO SAY SOMETHING BRIEFLY. SPEAKING TO THE SIDEWALK GAPS AND A RESIDENT SPOKE EARLIER TO THAT AND THE IDEA THAT WE DO NEED TO FILL THESE GAPS, AND ALSO THE -- ALSO THAT -- BUT THE FACT THAT WE DO, AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT IT'S A NEED AS A CITY AND IT BEEN F BENEFITS THEE OF THE COMMUNITY. IT LEADS ME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT A CITY AS A WHOLE SHOULD BE CARRYING THE COSTS FOR THIS. AND I NO KNOW THAT'S NOT HOW ITS BEEN DONE. THE MORE WE TALK ABOUT WHAT A GREAT COMMUNITY BENEFIT THAT SIDEWALKS ARE -- AND THEY ARE, AND WE ALL RECOGNIZE THAT -- THE MORE I THINK OUR SYSTEM FOR PAYING FOR THEM, THAT IS TO MAKE THE RESIDENT PAY FOR THEM, IS NOT THE RIGHT APPROACH. SO WE HAD BEFORE US ONE THAT I -- BECAUSE I KNOW THE AREA WELL. I USED TO LIVE A LITERAL STONE'S THROW FROM THERE AND NOW I LIVE FOUR BLOCKS FROM THERE. I -- I MEAN, I CAN SEE -- AND I SUGGESTED LAST -- WHEN THIS CAME OUT BEFORE THAT A DIFFERENT KIND OF PATH, A DIFFERENT KIND OF THING, A SIDEWALK NEAR THE STREET AND ALL DIFFERENT WAYS TO APPROACH A SIDEWALK TO CONTINUE TO FILL THE GAPS BUT I CAN'T GOOD ET CETERA MYSELF AROUND THE -- GET MYSELF AROUND THE IDEA THAT ONE PERSON IS PAYING FOR A SIDEWALK AND BENEFITS ALL AND ACCESS TO THE PARK. AND ESPECIALLY RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET WE HAVE A BUS STOP, AN A.T.A. STOP IN FRONT OF THIS PROPERTY, AND YOU GOT TO TO GO THIS WAY TO THE MARKED CROSSWALK AND THEN EASTBOUND ACROSS PONTIAC TRAIL TO WHAT IS A STUB. THERE'S NO SIDEWALK. AND SO WE HAVE A CROSSWALK GOING TO A LANDIN LANDING STUB E THERE'S NO SIDEWALK. AND THEN SO ALL THE HOUSING FOLKS GET OFF THE BUS AND ALL THE NEIGHBORS DO. IT'S A VERY ACTIVE BUS STOP, NOT JUST THE AVALON BUT EVERYBODY. AND THEY CREATED THIS GOAT PATH. AND SO THIS SIDEWALK PALES IN COMPARISON TO THE NEEDS ACROSS STREET IS WHAT I'M SAYING. SO I'M NOT GOING TO SUPPORT THIS TONIGHT FOR THE COST AND FOR THE IDEA THAT IT'S OUT OF SYNC WITH THE NEEDS OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD, FRANKLY. THANK YOU.
03:41:16.318: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION, COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
03:41:19.722: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES, ME TOO. I WANT TO THANK COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER FOR REVISITING THE IDEA THAT THERE AS A LOT OF SUPPORT OUT THERE FOR THE SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS FOR SIDEWALKS, NOT BEING CHARGED TO THE INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNER. BECAUSE -- BECAUSE A LOT OF THE HOMEOWNERS AREN'T EVEN GOING TO USE THE SIDEWALK. IT'S THE COMMUNITY THAT'S BENEFITING. SO WE'RE GOING TO WORK SOME MORE ON THAT ISSUE. BUT I THINK WE HAVE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT THE HISTORIC SIGNIFICANCE OF THE BECKLEY HOUSE AND HOW IT MAY BE -- IN THE TOP FIVE OR TEN, IF NOT THE MOST HISTORICALLY SIGNIFICANT HOME IN THE CITY. THAT'S A LITTLE REASON WHY I DON'T THINK WE NEED A SIDEWALK THERE. THE BIG REASON IS THE CRITICAL NEED FOR SIDEWALKS AND CROSSWALKS AND ILLUMINATION AND RFPs AND THOSE SORT OF -- THE CRITICAL NEED TO SPEND OUR MONEY ELSEWHERE. WE HAVE -- WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF IDENTIFYING. WE HAVE NEIGHBORS IDENTIFYING WHERE THERE IS MONEY TO BE WELL-SPENT ON REDUCING OUR PEDESTRIAN CRASH RATE AND INCREASING PEDESTRIAN SAFETY AND BIKE SAFETY. AND TO PUT 5 FEET WIDE, YOU KNOW, 1,000 SQUARE FEET APPROXIMATELY OF CONCRETE, WHERE WE DON'T NEED IT SO MUCH, WHERE IT'S NOT A TOP PRIORITY IS NOT MONEY WELL SPENT. I WANT TO CHA CLARIFY ONE THING ABOUT OUR AUTOMATED PRIORITIZATION SYSTEM. I THINK SOME COUNCILMEMBERS WERE CONFUSED IN THINKING THAT'S UPDATED CONTINUOUSLY, BUT I HAVE A MEMO FROM STAFF, FROM JUNE OF 2019, WHERE STAFF CONFIRM THAT THE -- WE'RE USING THE G.I.S. DATA FROM 2016, WHEN THIS ORIGINAL AUTOMATED SIDEWALK PRIORITIZATION SYSTEM WAS CREATED, AND THEY ARE MEETING STARTING LATER THIS WEEK OR LATER THIS MONTH TO UPDATE THAT SYSTEM. SO I LOOK FORWARD TO THOSE UPDATES TO WHERE THE AUTOMATED SYSTEM FEELS THE PRIORITY IS AND ALSO WHERE OUR PROFESSIONAL STAFF FEEL THE PRIORITIES ARE. WE KNOW WE ARE RECEIVING FEEDBACK FROM RESIDENTS ABOUT OTHER AREAS. AND THEN ONE OF THE THINGS JUST IN GENERAL I WANT TO SAY, IN CLOSING, ABOUT THE PROCESS FOR WHICH WE DO THATES SIDEWALKS. FOR THIS PARTICULAR SIDEWALK AT THE BECKLEY HOUSE, THE HOMEOWNER CAME INTO THE PROCESS WHEN WE WERE ALREADY ON RESOLUTION 3, AND IT WAS ONLY BECAUSE COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER AND I REACHED OUT TO HIM AFTER HE CAME TO PUBLIC COMMENT THAT WE WERE ABLE TO FIND OUT MORE DETAIL ABOUT THE SITUATION. AND SO GOING FORWARD, I WANT TO TELL SIDEWALK PROJECT PEOPLE, PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING SUBJECT TO THE SIDEWALK PROCESS FROM THE CITY TO REACH OUT TO THEIR COUNCILMEMBERS IF YOU FEEL THAT YOU NEEDE INFORMATION OR NEED SOMEONE TO HELP ADVOCATE FOR YOU BECAUSE RIGHT NOW, AS I MENTIONED AT THE BEGINNING OF TONIGHT'S MEETING, THERE'S A PRIVACY ISSUE WHERE WE ASKED TO BE COPIED ON YOUR CONCERNS, THERE'S A DISCONNECT THERE SO WE DON'T HAVE YOUR EMAILS AND PHONE NUMBERS TO -- SO YOU HAVE TO CONTACT US OR YOU HAVE TO COPY US IN YOUR COMMUNICATIONS WITH STAFF IN ORDER FOR US TO HAVE -- TO HELP REPRESENT YOU. SO THE PROCESS IS -- NEEDS WORK. I MEAN, I COULD GO ON THE SIDEWALKS. ONE OTHER THING WAS THAT -- THIS SIDEWALK THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT ON PONTIAC TRAIL AND ARGO, MAINLY ON ARGO WAS PART OF A WHOLE WATER MAIN REPLACEMENT PROJECT AND A WHOLE BUNCH OF NEIGHBORS WERE EARLY ON IN JANUARY -- DECEMBER/JANUARYEJANUARY ASKED Y WANTED THE SIDEWALK AND TEN HOUSEHOLDS SAID NO, WE UNANIMOUSLY, STRONGLY OPPOSE IT. WE DON'T WANT SIDEWALKS AND THE CITY SAID OKAY. BUT THIS PROPERTY WAS IN THE PROCESS OF BEING SOLD. THERM OUT OF THE LOOP. -- THEY WERE OUT OF THE LOOP AND THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO BE REMOVED FROM THE PROJECT AND SO THAT IS ONE OF THE -- THOSE ARE REASONS WHY I AM VOTING NO ON THIS SIDEWALK TONIGHT. I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TO IMPROVE THE PROCESS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, CONTINUE TO WORK AND TO SPEND OUR MONEY TO REDUCE OUR PEDESTRIAN CRASH RATES AND INCREASE OUR SAFETY FOR OUR BIKES AND OUR PEDESTRIANS IN THE CITY. THANKS.
03:46:32.835: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
03:46:34.570: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU. FIRST, I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT I DO RESPECT THE CONCERNS EXPRESSED BY THE PROPERTY OWNER IN TERMS OF NOT WANTING TO RISK THE HISTORICAL CHARACTER OF THIS IMPORTANT UNDERGROUND RAILROAD BECKLEY HOUSE. I THINK THAT'S VALID AND UNDERSTANDABLE CONCERN. SO THE QUESTION THERE IS, FOR SOME OF US, WHO THE SIDEWALK SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTS THE NATURE AND THE FEEL OF HISTORIC HOME. THERE ARE, OF COURSE, MANY HISTORIC HOMES IN SIGHTS HERE AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY THAT HAVE SIDEWALKS. SO IS IT COMPROMISED? I'M NOT SO SURE. MY CONCERN IS, WELL, ONCE YOU BEGIN TO WEIGH THAT SORT OF OBJECTION, TO FILL A SIDEWALK GAP FOR THEM OR OTHER SIDEWALK OPTIONS, WITH DOES IT STOP? I THINK IT'S ALSO A CONCERN WE SHOULD GRAPPLE WITH. I WILL SAY I FOUND ONE OF THE STAFF Q&A RESPONSES IN CONSIDERING THIS PROJECT AND THIS ASSESSMENT. THE QUESTION IS WHETHER FILLING OTHER SIDEWALK GAPS WERE HONORED OR THIS ONE. FILLING THIS PARTICULAR SIDEWALK GAP WAS RATED FAIRLY HIGH AND T THE PRIORITIZATION MODEL. I THINK THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT -- YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY, IT'S A HIGH PRIORITY GAP. I DO RECOGNIZE THAT THE ASSESSMENT IS NOT INSIGNIFICANT AT OVER $7,000 AND I SYMPATHIZE WITH THE OWNER. THE CITY HAS APPLIED ITS NORMAL RULES REGARDING NEW SIDEWALK INSTALLATIONS AND RELATED INVESTMENTS. I WILL JUST SAY SO -- YEAH. SINCE THE MAYOR'S VETO, I WENT BACK AND LOOKED AT PAST MAYOR VETOES TO SEE IF ANY MAYOR HAD VETOED PLACING A BALLOT QUESTION ON THE BALLOT, AND AS YOU HEARD ME SAY, NOW THIS IS UNPRECEDENTED. SO THERE I'M READING THESE OLD, YOU KNOW, MINUTES, MEETING MINUTES BECAUSE I WAS LOOKING FOR SOME SPECIFIC VETOES TO FIND OUT PRECISELY WHAT THEY WERE AND THE CLERK'S OFFICE WAS EXCEEDINGLY HELPFUL AND I'M GOING THROUGH PAGE UPON PAGE OF SIDEWALK ASSESSMENTS. SO WE BASICALLY HAVE BEEN DOING FOR THIS 40 PLUS PLUS YEARS, OKAY, THIS WAY. I SEE MR. HUPY SITTING OVER THERE IN THE CORNER. AND IT'S THE PROCESS. AND IF PEOPLE WANT THE SIDEWALK MILLAGE TO PAY FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION, THEN FOLKS, YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A NEW MILLAGE. WHEN THE SIDEWALK MILLAGE WAS CREATED, IT'S FOR MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR AND MR. HUPY, YOU ARE WELCOME TO UP AND SPEAK TO THAT. WHEN YOU HEAR THIS FROM FOLKS TELL THEM -- ASK THEM IF THEY WANT A NEW MILLAGE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WOULD BE REQUIRED BECAUSE THIS IS THE WAY IT'S ALWAYS BEEN DONE. AND SO UNLESS YOU HAVE, YOU KNOW, CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE YOU HAVE A SAFE WALKS TO SCHOOLS GRANT OR A FEDERAL GRANT TO OFFSET THAT COST, IT'S PAID FOR BY THE PROPERTY OWNER AND THE AMOUNT IS BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF FRONTAGE. AND WE HAVE BEEN DOING IT THIS WAY FOR DECADES AND DECADES. SO THAT -- ALL OF THAT AND, AGAIN MR. HUPY, YOU KNOW, COME UP HERE AND WEIGH IN ON ANY OF THIS. BUT THAT COUPLED WITH THE FACT THAT THIS GAP IS CONSIDERED A PRIORITY DOES LEAD ME TO CONCLUDE THAT WE SHOULD PROCEED WITH THIS PROJECT AND THE ASSESSMENT. THANKS.
03:50:26.868: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER NELSON AND HAYNER AND PERHAPS WE COULD CALL IT A DAY?
03:50:30.772: >> Councilmember Hayner: SURE. MINE IS A QUESTION.
03:50:33.241: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I WANT TO QUICKLY SAY THAT I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS MOSTLY BECAUSE IT'S CONNECTING TO A PARK. AND GENERALLY SPEAKING, I DO -- I DO WANT TO SUPPORT SIDEWALKS BUT THE THING THAT -- THE THING THAT I -- I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE A SERIOUS CONVERSATION ABOUT IS THIS PROCESS OF PRIORITIZING SIDEWALKS BECAUSE I KNOW THAT OUR -- HOW WE PRIORITIZE SIDEWALKS BECAUSE I NO HE IN WARD 4, I GET A LOT OF COMMUNICATION FROM RESIDENTS ABOUT THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN PACKARD AND INDUSTRIAL AND WE HAVE SOME STREETS THAT HAVE SIDEWALK GAPS THAT NEED FILLING AND SIMPSON BETWEEN INDUSTRIAL AND STATE. I'M JUST CONFUSED AS TO -- I UNDERSTAND THE EFFICIENCY OF PUTTING IN SIDEWALKS WHEN WE ALREADY HAVE CITY CREWS OUT WORKING BUT IT IS FRUSTRATING TO A LOT OF RESIDENTS WHO HAVE GOAT PATHS AND PEOPLE WALKING DOWN STREET JUST YEAR AFTER YEAR, AND WONDERING WHERE THEY ARE IN THE PRIORITY LIST. WE GET QUESTIONS A LOT, WHAT ARE THE POTHOLES GOING TO BE REPAIRED ON MY STREET, AND THEN WE GET QUESTIONS WHEN ARE WE GOING TO GET SIDEWALKS? I WISH WE HAD FEWER QUESTIONS COMING BEFORE US OF SIDEWALKS WHERE THE RESIDENTS DON'T WANT THEM, BECAUSE WE'RE INVESTING MONEY IN PLACES WHERE THE RESIDENTS ARE BEGGING FOR THEM. SO I GUESS THAT'S THE OWN THING I HAVE TO ADD TO THE DIS -- THE OWN THING I HAVE TO ADD TO THE DISCUSSION. I APPRECIATE THAT IT'S CONNECTING PEOPLE TO A PARK.
03:52:04.499: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. HAYNER.
03:52:05.100: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I COULD HAVE SENT THESE YOU TO EARLER, ABOUT THE I CAN'T. MY TWO RHETORICAL QUESTIONS AROUND THIS ISSUE. WHAT WOULD THE YEARLY COST BE TO THE CITY IF WE PICKED UP THE TAB FOR ALL OF THESE SIDEWALK GAPS THAT WE ARE FILLING ON AVERAGE? AND MY SECOND QUESTION WOULD BE:  IS A HOMEOWNER ALLOWED TO CREATE A SIDEWALK TO THE CITY STANDARD OUT OF THEIR OWN POCKET WITHOUT THE CITY BILLING THEM FOR IT? AND WITH ALL THE PERMITTING, ENGINEERING AND INSPECTION THAT GOES WITH THAT SO THOSE ARE MY RHETORICAL QUESTIONS AROUND THE TOPIC. I GUESS WE WILL HAVE TO GET SOMETHING ON THE AGENDA TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION. I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHERE THIS CONVERSATION WOULD TAKE PLACE. IS THIS A STAFF ISSUE? A PLANNING ISSUE? I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW?
03:52:51.213: >> City Admin. Lazarus: I WILL LET MR. HUPY ANSWER THE SECOND QUESTION. AND THEN I WILL RESPOND TO THE FIRST ONE.
03:52:55.617: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU.
03:53:03.525: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON'S COMMENT. FIRST OF ALL, CRAIG HUPY, PUBLIC SERVICES AREA ADMINISTRATOR. YES, A RESIDENT CAN BUILD THEIR OWN SIDEWALK TO OUR STANDARD. THERE'S NOTHING PREVENTING THEM FROM DOING THAT. AND TO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT FILLING GAPS AND RESIDENTS AND WONDERING WHERE THEY ARE. THEY CAN REQUEST A SIDEWALK GAP TO BE FILLED. IT DOES CHANGE THE PRIORITY RANKING. ONE OF THE THINGS WE CONSIDERED IS THEIR SUPPORT OR THE REQUEST IN PLACE FOR A SOMEWHAT GAP TO BE FILLED.
03:53:42.797: >> Councilmember Nelson: OKAY. SO I'M A LITTLE BIT FAMILIAR WITH A DIFFERENT CITY PROCESS BECAUSE IT HAPPENED IN WARD 4, REQUESTING TRAFFIC CALMING MEASURES. IS REQUESTING FILLING SIDEWALK GAPS ANY CLOSE RELATION OR COUSIN TO THE --
03:54:00.749: >> NO.
03:54:00.982: >> Councilmember Nelson: THAT PROCESS, IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT IT WOULD BE INTERESTING IF FILLING SIDEWALK GAPS HAD A PROCESS THAT WAS SIMILAR TO THAT.
03:54:10.926: >> CURRENTLY THEY DON'T MATCH EACH OTHER.
03:54:12.027: >> Councilmember Nelson:  WE ARE ADDING POINTS TO THE SCORE?
03:54:14.829: >> RIGHT NOW.
03:54:15.363: >> Councilmember Nelson: OKAY.
03:54:16.731: >> AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED, AS STAFF, WE ARE LOOKING AT THE PRIOR TPRIORITIZATION MODEL ANDE RANKINGS GIVEN UPON THE CONSIDERATION -- THE WEIGHT. WHAT THE WEIGHTS ARE GIVEN. SO THE -- NOT -- THE G.I.S. BASE HAS NOT CHANGED MUCH IN THREE YEARS. THE GAPS ARE THE GAPS THAT ARE THERE. WHAT STAFF WAS CONCERNED ABOUT AND WILLING TO LOOK AT IS THE RANKING BASED UPON THE RIGHT WEIGHTINGS OF CONDITIONS.
03:55:00.308: >> Councilmember Nelson:  SO IF THERE'S -- IF IT'S NOT A FORMAL PROCESS, WHO WOULD RESIDENTS CONTACT TO -- TO EXPRESS THEIR SUPPORT AND REQUEST --
03:55:09.951: >> THE CITY ENGINEER.
03:55:11.586: >> Councilmember Nelson:  THE CITY ENGINEER.
03:55:14.322: >> MR. HUTCHINSON.
03:55:14.756: >> Councilmember Nelson:  SO YOUR EMAIL, I CAN FORWARD? OH, EXCELLENT.
03:55:18.960: >> IT'S VERY SIMPLE. AND THEN BACK TO THE QUESTION OF COST. THE ASSESSMENT THAT IS UNDER -- THAT IS FOR THIS ONE PARCEL WOULD BE PAID OFF OVER SIX YEARS BUT AGAIN I REMIND COUNCIL THAT IT'S THEIR PREROGATIVE TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO EXTEND IT IF YOU WERE TO CHOOSE TO AUTHORIZE A LONGER PAYBACK PERIOD THAT'S WELL WITHIN YOUR PREROGATIVE.
03:55:52.027: >> City Admin. Lazarus: THE QUESTION WAS ASKED IF WE TOOK ON THE BURDEN, HOW MUCH DOES IT COST? IT DEPENDS HOW MUCH WORK YOU WANT TO GET DONE EVERY YEAR AND SO IT'S AN OPEN-ENDED QUESTION. I WANT TO REEMPHASIZE HERE. STAFF HAS A RATIONAL PROCESS BASED UPON THE TRACTORS AND THE COST, AND CONNECTIVITY THAT THEY USE TO EVALUATE THE PRIORITY OF SIDEWALKS. IT'S A FAIR SYSTEM. IT'S SIMILAR TO WHAT I HAVE USED IN OTHER PLACES. THE ASSESSMENT PROCESS IS DEFINED BY ORDINANCE. IT'S NO THE SOMETHING THAT STAFF HAS DEVELOPED, NOR DO WE HAVE ANY DISCRETION IN FOR NEW SIDEWALKS. WE HAVE HAD THE CONVERSATION BEFORE, IF COUNCIL WOULD LIKE TO GIVE US THE DIRECTION TO LOOK AT OTHER OPTIONS WE WOULD CERTAINLY COMPLY WITH COUNCIL'S DIRECTION AS WELL, BUT IT IS MOST CERTAINLY A DISCUSSION EVER POLICY DIRECTION THAT WE WOULD ASK COUNCIL TO PROVIDE IT. THE FACT THAT FILLING IN SIDEWALK GAPS CAN BE EXPENSIVE AT TIMES IS A MATTER THAT COUNCIL SHOULD CONSIDER.
03:56:56.157: >> CAN WE?
03:56:57.158: >> City Admin. Lazarus: COUNCIL HAS THE DISCRETION TO AS MR. HUPY SAID TO EXTEND THE PERIOD IN WHICH THOSE PAYMENTS WERE MADE. IN SOME CASES WHEN -- DURING THE PROCESS, PROPERTY CHANGES HANDS, IT'S A LITTLE BUILT UNFAIR TO SAY STAFF HASN'T CONTACTED THE PROPERTY OWNER BECAUSE WE DID START THE PROCESS WITH THE PROPERTY OWNER. I WOULD EXPECT THAT IF YOU ARE BUYING A HOUSE, YOU CAN ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT LIABILITIES THAT ARE THERE. SO I KNOW IT'S DIFFICULT. I KNOW THAT COST IS A DRIVING FACTOR. SOMETIMES WE TRY TO FIND OTHER REASONS TO GET AROUND THE FACTOR THAT COST IS A DRIVING FACTOR BUT IT'S GOVERNED BY ORDINANCE. EVERY HOMEOWNER AND EVERY PROPERTY OWNER HAS PAID FOR THE SIDEWALK BY ONE MEANS OR ANOTHER. IT'S PART OF A NETWORK. TO SAY THAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE WALKING ON IT, THEY SHOULD PAY FOR IT, IT CAN BE FLIPPED TO WHERE IF I'M WALKING ON YOUR SIDEWALK, I SHOULD PAY FOR IT. SO IT'S REALLY A MATTER OF A COMMUNAL BENEFIT AND THE WAY IT'S STRUCTURED, THE PROPERTY OWNERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INSTALLATION. COUNCIL WANTS TO CHANGE THAT, YOU CAN GIVE US THE DIRECTION TO BRING US SOME CHANGES BACK TO THE ORDINANCE.
03:58:06.428: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBERS LUMM AND HAYNER. IT'S RANGING INTO I ACONVERSATION MORE BROAD THAN
03:58:12.200: >> Councilmember Lumm: ABSOLUTE LY. AND I WILL JUST POINT OUT THAT ENGINEERING THANK YOU VERY MUCH, HAS A GREAT FAQ PAGE AND I JUST SENT IT TO FOLKS ON THIS VERY TOPIC. AND IF ANY NEIGHBORHOOD CAN PETITION THEY WANT SIDEWALKS AND THAT IS LAID OUT, AND THE CONTACT INFORMATION IS THERE FOR MR. HUTCHINSON AND IT'S A GOOD PROCESS, AND IF THE CITY IS GOING TO CONSIDER CHANGING ANY RULES YOU KNOW -- HAVE YOU HEARD ME SAY THIS BEFORE, THEY SHOULD -- WE GOT TO BE FAIR AND THEY SHOULD AB PLIED RETROACTIVELY TO PEOPLE WOULD ARE NOW IN THESE ASSESSMENT PAYMENTS, YOU KNOW, GOING BACK, SAY MINIMUM FIVE YEARS. AND WE GOT TO BE EQUITABLE AND FAIR AND APPLY RULES, YOU KNOW, AGAIN FAIRLY AND EQUITABLY. SO WE HAVE -- WE HAVE -- WE UNDERTAKE SIDEWALK GAP PROJECTS YEAR IN AND YEAR OUT. AND RULES GOT TO BE THE SAME FOR EVERYBODY WHO IS GOING ALONG WITH THIS PROGRAM. THANKS.
03:59:19.467: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNSEL SIM MEMBER HAYNER.
03:59:20.502: >> Councilmember Hayner: WHEN WE START TO BE RETROACTIVELY EQUITABLE, I WANT MY $750, THREE MONTHS BEFORE THE SIDEWALK MILLAGE WAS OVER. I KNOW PEOPLE DID A LOT MORE THAN THAT. I GUESS I WILL SAY THIS AND WE WILL VOTE ON IT. APOLOGIZE FOR DRAGGING THIS OUT A LITTLE BUT I THINK IT'S AN INTERESTING TOPIC FOR US TO ADDRESS IN THE FUTURE AND I THINK THAT IT SEEMS LIKE IT WOULD BE REASONABLE TO -- YOU KNOW, THE ASSESSOR WOULD CERTAINLY BE ABLE TO PULL THE RECORD OF ALL THE SIDEWALK ASSESSED TOTAL VALUE FOR THE LAST SO MANY YEARS AND THAT MIGHT BE A PLACE WHERE WE SAY, HEY, WE ARE STARTING FROM HERE OR NOT, AND CONSIDER WITH THE CITY TAKING OVER, PERHAPS PUTTING A CAP PER SQUARE THAT THE HOMEOWNER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS MUCH AND THIS MUCH, JUST TO GET A SENSE OF IT. I GUESS I WILL ADDRESS THAT, MR. LAZARUS TO YOU IN AN EMAIL REQUEST. IS THAT OKAY? WE CAN SAY CAN THE ASSESSOR OR SOMEONE TAKE A LOOK AT THAT AND GIVE US AN HISTORIC RECORD OF WHAT WE HAVE BEEN SPENDING ON SIDEWALK GAP ASSESSMENTS.
04:00:26.834: >> City Admin. Lazarus: I THINK IT'S FOR A CONVERSATION BUNT NOT AT 11:00 AT NIGHT. I WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO SIT THROUGH IT.
04:00:33.708: >> Councilmember Hayner:  NO, IT'S WHAT THE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN PAYING. THE ASSESSMENT VALUE.
04:00:37.412: >> City Admin. Lazarus: GETTING THE ASSESSMENT IS NOT THE HARD PART.
04:00:41.382: >> Councilmember Hayner: OKAY.
04:00:43.718: >> Mayor Taylor: ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE. STARTINGWITH COU COUNCILMEMBER Z WORLD.

04:01:30.765: >> Councilmember Hayner: OPPOSED.

04:02:05.199: >> Councilmember Hayner: YES, I FIGURE SINCE I'M GOING TO BE CHARACTERIZED IN THE SOCIAL MEDIA AS AGAINST SIDEWALKS, I MIGHT AS BE UNIFORM IN MY OPPOSITION TO THEM TONIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] SO THIS ONE HERE IS EXTRA INTERESTING TO ME, BECAUSE HERE WAS A CASE WHERE WE HAD NO REAL CALL FOR SIDEWALKS UNTIL WE OVER DEVELOPED THIS CORNER AND NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN WE NEED SIDEWALKS. AND SO WE HAVE -- SINCE THIS IS WARD ONE AGAIN, WE HAVE GOTTEN A LOT OF INPUT FROM RESIDENTS WHO ARE NOT THRILLED WITH THIS, ESPECIALLY WAYS THAT VARIOUS SPLITS AND DEED RESTRICTIONS AND COVENANTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE PAST SUBDIVIDED THIS IN AN UNUSUAL WAY. AND SO THERE'S HUNDREDS OF FOLKS PAYING HUNDREDS OF BUCKS AND SOME PEOPLE ARE PAYING THOUSANDS. AND THIS GETS BACK TO THE EQUITY ISSUE THAT I THINK WE NEED TO ADDRESS. I -- THERE WERE SOME -- THERE WERE SOME RESIGNATION -- NOT RESIGNATION, BUT -- WELL, THERE'S SOME OF THAT TOO. THERE WAS SOME RESERVATIONS GIVEN BY SOME HOMEOWNERS THAT I -- I HAVE TO SAY PUBLICLY, I CAN'T -- I CAN'T ACCEPT THESE CONCERNS THAT PEOPLE DON'T WANT SIDEWALKS GOING NEAR THEIR HOUSE BAZ BECAUSE THEY ARE AFRAD IT WILL BRING CRIME. WITH HAVE HEARD THAT. I'M SURE YOU HAVE HEARD ALL KIND OF THINGS AND I WANT TO REJECT THE NOTION THAT ANN ARBOR IS A DANGEROUS CITY IF WE PUT SIDEWALKS IN. THAT'S JUST GOING TOO FAR ANTI-SIDEWALK, EVEN FOR ME. SO I DON'T SUPPORT THAT IDEA BUT I DO HAVE MANY MY CONCERNS ABOUT THE EQUITABLE NATURE OF THIS ASSESSMENT, ESPECIALLY. SO I -- I'M GOING TO BE UNIFORM IN MY REJECTION OF THESE ASSESSMENTS TONIGHT. THANK YOU.
04:03:49.904: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
04:03:51.539: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WILL SUPPORT THIS AND ACTUALLY, I THOUGHT THAT SIDEWALKS SHOULD HAVE BEEN REQUIRED AT THE TIME FOX FIRE WAS BUILT, BECAUSE THE CHILDREN WOULD BE -- WOULD WALK FROM FOX FIRE IN THE STREET TO GET TO CLAGUE SCHOOL AND HURON ARE WHATEVER WHEN THEY MISSED THE BUS. IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT THE ASSESSMENT PROCESS IS NOT AS CLEAN AS I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT, BUT THIS IS CRITICALLY NEEDED FOR SAFETY.
04:04:22.837: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
04:04:23.771: >> Councilmember Hayner:  HOW IS IT THAT SOME DEVELOPMENTS GET AWAY WITH NOT PUTTING IN SIDEWALKS AND OTHERS DO? THEY ALL -- WE ALL REQUIRE SIDEWALKS NOW, CORRECT? LIKE THE NIXON FARMS AND SO FORTH, THEY PUT IN THEIR SIDEWALK SHARE. IS THAT UNIFORM GOING FORWARD? ARE WE EVER GOING TO HAVE A SITUATION WHERE A DEVELOPER FAILS TO PUT IN SIDEWALKS IN THE FUTURELY? I CERTAINLY HOPE NOT?

WE MAY ONLY HAVE ONE PERSON SPEAKING AT A TIME AND IF YOU REQUIRE ASSISTANCE IF SPEAKING BEFORE COUNCIL TODAY, WE WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO PROVIDE IT TO YOU S. THERE ANYONE WOULD WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT.
04:06:33.701: >> COUNCIL, DON'T BASH THE PRESS. WE LIVE IN A TRUMPING SOCIETY WHERE RACIST COMMENTS ARE ACCEPTED BY THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. THE PRESS AND THE VARIOUS FORMS OF IT HOLD LOCAL GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABLE. I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR COMMENTS AGAINST THE OTHER LOCAL PRESS THAT'S CURRENTLY WORKING AGAINST DESTROYIA FOIA REQUESTS. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, EVEN WHEN I DISAGREE WITH YOU POLITICALLY, I DON'T BELIEVE THAT YOUR BUSINESSES SHOULD BE TARGETED FOR A BOYCOTT. I HATE WHEN PEOPLE ARE TARGETED AT THEIR PLACES EVER BUSINESS. IT'S NOT SIGHT IN MY VALUES TO BOYCOTT YOUR BUSINESS FOREIGN FOR FIR POLITICAL BELIEFS WHEN IT COMES TO INTERNATIONAL POLICIES, I THINK THOSE ARE BEYOND THE THAT OF CITY COUNCIL. COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN, YOU WERE INCREDIBLE, HOW YOU TALKED ABOUT THIS INCREDIBLY HARD TOPIC. AND COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, FREE SPEECH IS IMPORTANT. DO NOT GIVE HATRED A SECOND MICROPHONE. HAKE RED HAS THREE TO SIX MINUTES. DON'T GIVE HATRED ANOTHER THREE MINUTES. MAYOR, I HATE VETOES. I RECOGNIZE THAT YOU CAN DO THEM, BUT I HATE THEM. I CAN UNDERSTAND VETOES A BIT IF THERE'S A CRITICAL ISSUE THAT WOULD CAUSE GREAT HARM TO THE CITY, EAT LETTER FINANCIALLY OR LEGALLY BUT THIS VETO IS NEITHER. LASTLY, I WANT TO TOUCH UPON BY FOIA REQUEST AGAIN. AND THE RESPONSE I GOT FROM THE CITY IT SAID THAT, IN QUOTE, FURTHER THE CITY IS PROHIBITED FROM DISCLOSING SOME OF THEIR RESPONSIVE RECORDS TO THIS PORT OF YOUR REQUEST PURSUANT TO PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION. UNTIL FURTHER ISSUED BY THE CIRCUIT COURT, THE CITY CANNOT PRODUCE THESE RECORDS. I KNOW YOU CAN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THIS. IT'S LITIGATION. BUT DO YOU NOT REALIZE THE HYPOCRISY OF THIS. MANY OF YOU WHO RAN OFFICE, RAN ON TRANSPARENCY TO RUN ON A PLATFORM OF TRANCE PARENTY IS BUT THEN TO SIT ON COUNCIL THAT'S STRIPPING AWAY TRANSPARENCY ON YOUR OWN WATCH THAT'S DISTURBING. I HOPE THAT IN THE CLOSED SESSIONS THAT YOU CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR TRANSPARENCY. LASTLY, COUNCILMEMBER NELSON, HAPPY BIRTHDAY. HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.
04:08:47.701: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? I'M SORRY. THANK YOU. NEXT, PLEASE. MY APOLOGIES.
04:08:54.575: >> ANDREW PICNIC, 711 ARGO DRIVE. I WILL TALK REALLY QUICKLY ABOUT THE FAIRVIEW CEMETERY CHANGES. AND THEN DOVE TAIL THAT INTO MAYBE A COUPLE OF SUGGESTIONS TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE PROBLEMS WITH MAYBE DOG WASTE FOUND IN THE CEMETERY. THE FAIRVIEW CEMETERY CURRENTLY, I THINK AND I MAY BE WRONG. YOU HAVEN'T BEEN THERE IN A WHILE, FROM THE FRONT ENTRANCE SAYS NO PET EXERCISING, I BELIEVE, IS THE CURRENT LANGUAGE. BUT WAS CLEARLY OPEN TO HAVING YOUR PET WITH YOU OR IT WOULD JUST SAY CLEARLY NO PETS, I THINK. SO ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THERE WITH TO  TO GOES EXERCISING OR PLAYING OFF LEASH MIGHT BE SOLVED IN THE FENCE AROUND THE CEMETERY WERE SIMPLY REMOVED. THAT WOULD LOWER THE COST TO THE CITY, MAKE IT PRETTIER AROUND THE AREA, AND PROBABLY SOLVE YOUR OFF LEASH DOG PROBLEM HE I AT THE SAME TIME. AND ON THE FECES OR THE DO DOG WASTE FRONT, I WOULD BE VERY INTERESTED IN WHEN WE COULD POTENTIALLY UP THE GRASS CUTTING FREQUENCY SO IF YOU ARE DOG DOES GO TO THE BATHROOM AND IT MAY BE HARD TO FIND IN THE EXTREMELY TALL GRASS THAT WE HAVE HAD THIS YEAR THROUGHOUT OUR PARK SYSTEM. SO NOT MUCH MORE TO SAY BUT MAYBE UPPING THE FREQUENCY, MAYBE SOMETHING I WILL TAKE UP WITH THE COUNCILMEMBERS BECAUSE I THINK WHEN THAT CAME BY, THAT WAS A RECESSION RESPONSE, AND GAS WAS VERY EXPENSIVE. AND MAYBE THERE'S ROOM IN THE BUDGET TO CHANGE THOSE THINGS AROUND JUST A LITTLE BIT. THANK YOU.
04:10:44.351: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
04:10:56.530: >> HI, MY NAME IS ED VELMETTI. I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO ONE ISSUE REGARDING THE SIDEWALK GAP SPECIFICALLY THE SIDEWALK GAP ALONG STIMSON STREET. STIMSON IS IN THE 4th WARD. IT'S CONNECTOR BETWEEN STATE STREET AND SOUTH INDUSTRIAL. DURING FOOTBALL SEASON THERE'S LOTS OF PEOPLE TRAMPING DOWN, GOING TO THE GAME. DURING THE REST OF THE YEAR, THERE'S TWO ACTIVE BUS STOPS ON THAT STREET. IT'S RELATIVELY LOW-INCOME HOUSING ALONG THAT AREA, INCLUDING SOME -- I THINK THERE'S AVALON HOUSING THERE. AND AS A RESIDENT OF THE NEARBY NEIGHBORHOOD, I DON'T KNOW ANYONE IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD. IT'S A LITTLE -- THERE'S A LITTLE CHUNK OF NEIGHBORHOOD THERE THAT AS FAR AS I KNOW DOESN'T HAVE ITS OWN NAME. CERTAINLY DOESN'T HAVE A NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATION THAT I HAVE EVER FOUND. I DON'T THINK IT HAS ITS OWN NEXT DOOR OR FACEBOOK GROUP. I THINK IT'S JUST SPACE. BUT THIS IS A -- A SIDEWALK GAP THAT'S BEEN IDENTIFIED SINCE 2013, WHEREIN THE SOUTH STATE STREET CORRIDOR PLAN DOCUMENT OF 2013, PAGE 17, IT NOTES CURRENTLY THE STATE/STIMSON, THEY HAVE SIDEWALKS THAT ABRUPTLY END AND THE RECOMMENDATION WAS TO CONNECT EXISTING SIDEWALKS AND FILL IN AREAS WHERE THE SIDEWALKS END AND IMPROVE SIDEWALKS AT THE STATE STIMSON AND BRING IT 40 MINIMUM A.D.A. STANDARDS AND SIX YEARS OF CITY'S OWN DOCUMENTS RECOMMENDING SIMPLE, BASIC, IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF WHETHER PEOPLE WALK THERE. IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF WHETHER IT'S SEEN BY VISITORS TO OUR FAIR CITY. IT'S JUST A VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD, WE HAVE VERY DEEP RUTS OF DIRT THERE. WE HAVE PEOPLE WALKING TO AND FROM BUS STOPS. WE HAVE PEOPLE LIVING WHO DO NOT HAVE AS MUCH INCOME AND MAYBE DEPEND ON THAT BUS TO GET THERE. IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW, REALLY NOT -- NOT A GOOD SPOT. I HAVE NO EARTHLY IDEA HOW YOU ALL PRIORITIZE THINGS. NO CLUE AT ALL. AND I'M LED TO BELIEVE THAT EMAIL TO SOME PEOPLE WILL BUMP THIS INCREMENTALLY UP AND I HAVE DONE THAT. BUT I THOUGHT THAT, YOU KNOW, SOMETHING SMALL LIKE SPEAKING AT CITY COUNCIL AT QUARTER AFTER 11:00 MIGHT HELP THINGS ALONG MAYBE. MAYBE NOT. THANKS.
04:13:47.901: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT? SEEING NO ONE, PUBLIC COMMENT IS CLOSED. THERE ARE COMMUNICATIONS FROM COUNCIL? COUNCILMEMBER GRAND?
04:13:58.879: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. I WANTED TO RESPOND TO THE GENTLEMAN WHO HAD CONCERNS ABOUT THE MOWING CYCLE. THIS SPRING, WE HAD A LOT OF RAIN. SO IT'S TRUE THAT WHILE DURING THE RECESSION WE WERE ON A 21 HAD I HAVE DAY MOWING CYCLE, WE ARE NOW ON A 14-DAY MOWING CYCLE. THAT WAS CHALLENGING WHEN IT WAS RAINING FOR LIKE SEVEN DAYS STRAIGHT AND THEN THE RAIN MAKES THE GRASS GROW. IT ALSO MADE A FEW PLACES IN THE PARK DANGEROUS TO MOW OR WHERE THEY WERE ABLE TO MOW. I DID GET SOME QUESTIONS FROM CONSTITUENTS, SAYING, ARE THEY DOING ONE OF THOSE BIOSWAIL THINGS INTENTIONALLY, BUT, NO, IT JUST -- THEY COULDN'T GET THE MOWERS IN FOR SAFETY REASONS OR BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T WANT TO DESTROY THE PARK. SO NOW THAT WE HAVEN'T HAD AS MUCH RAIN, ALTHOUGH AROUND THE CORNER, I'M SURE WE WILL HAVE SOME RAIN. YOU SHOULD SEE THE PARKS COMING BACK TO OUR 14-DAY STANDARDS.
04:14:50.998: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
04:14:51.899: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WAS AT A SIMCOG TASK FORCE MEETING THIS WEEK AND I WANT TO MENTION THAT ONE OF THE SIMCOG GOALS IS TO HAVE A UNIFORM STATE CROSSWALK LAW. THE OTHER THING I WANTED TO APOLOGIZE. MY STATEMENT REGARDING MLIVE, I SHOULD HAVE BEEN CLEARER. I WAS NOT CRITICIZING MLIVE. IT WAS THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT OPINIONS, AND INTERPRETS OF THE ARTICLE AND AC APOLOGIZE FOR NOT BEING CLEARER.
04:15:23.564: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER COMMUNICATIONS. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
04:15:28.168: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: TTHANK YOU, MAYOR TAYLOR. I NOTICED ELECTRIC LEAF BLOWERS IN THE DOWNTOWN AREA. SO I WAS HAPPY TO SEE THAT. HOPEFULLY THERE'S GOING TO BE 100% ADHERENCE TO OUR NEW ORDINANCE THAT WAS ADOPTED AND HAS GONE INTO EFFECT ON JULY 1st TO NOT HAVE THOSE NOISE-GENERATING CO-2 EMITTING LEAF BLOWERS OUT THERE. IT WAS GOOD TO SEE THE ELECTRIC LEAF BLOWERS OUT IN THE DOWNTOWN AREA.
04:16:06.273: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER COMMUNICATION.
04:16:08.675: >> Councilmember Lumm: IT'S NON-SECOND WITH TER AT THIS HOUR. THE LEAF BLOWER REMINDED ME THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY SEEING IN SOME NEIGHBORHOODS LEAVES FALLING FROM TREES. WE HAVE A GYPSY MOTH PROBLEM. I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO BE AS SIGNIFICANT AS THE PROBLEM WE WERE CONFRONTING AROUND THIS TIME LAST YEAR BECAUSE WE HAVE HAD A LOT MORE RAIN AND THAT SUPPRESSES THE POPULATION, BUT I WILL BE FOLLOWING UP. I TALKED SOME PRIVATE TREE COMPANIES AND ASKED THEM WHAT THEY ARE SEEING AND THEY ARE SEEING CATERPILLAR DAMAGE AND OBVIOUSLY, YOU KNOW, TREE DAMAGE IN VARIOUS PARTS OF TOWN. I KNOW ON THE WEST SIDE IN THE FIFTH WARD, THEY ARE SEEING TREE DAMAGE DUE TO -- TO THE GYPSY MOTHS AND SO I'M HOPING THAT -- I KNOW THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN BECAUSE THE NORTH CAMPUS, THE RESEARCH COMPLEX WAS DEVASTATED LAST YEAR AND THE NEIGHBORHOODS IN AND AROUND THAT AREA, AND THE UNIVERSITY HAD A PLAN FOR ADDRESSING THIS, AND I -- THE CITY REALLY DIDN'T HAVE A PLAN. SO I WILL BE FOLLOWING UP AND HOPE THAT -- THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S ON OUR RADAR. AND IT -- AND THAT WE HAVE BEEN TRACKING THIS AROUND TOWN BECAUSE IT'S -- IT IS A PROBLEM IN SOME AREAS. AGAIN, UNFORTUNATEY THERE. NOT AS BAD AS LAST YEAR, BUT THEY ARE OUT THERE. THANKS.
04:17:43.870: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER COMMUNICATION? DO WE HAVE A CLOSED SESSION TODAY, MR. POSTEMA?
04:17:47.874: >> City Atty. Postema: YES, WE DO. IT WILL BE A SHORT ONE, I BELIEVE, AND IT IS ON THE LESKO WASHTENAW CIRCUIT COUNTY COURT CASE.
04:17:59.353: >> Mayor Taylor: MAY I HAVE A POLICE STATION TO GO INTO CLOSED SESSION. MOVED BY LANER AND SECONDED GRISWOLD. QUESTION?
04:18:08.428: >> Councilmember Hayner:  CAN I ADD ONGOING LITIGATION, CITY vs. GELMAN.
04:18:14.635: >> City Atty. Postema: WE COULD GO IN ON THAT BUT WE WILL PROVIDE SOMETHING WRITTEN FOR YOU.
04:18:18.438: >> Councilmember Hayner:  SO I WON'T BE ABLE TO ASK A QUESTION BACK IN THERE FOR IT?
04:18:21.775: >> City Atty. Postema: IF YOU WANT TO ADD IT IN.
04:18:25.212: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WOULD LIKE TO ADD THAT AS ONE OF OUR REASONS.
04:18:28.015: >> City Atty. Postema: THAT IS THE GELMAN CASE, WHERE EAR THE INTERVENERS IN THE WASHTENAW CIRCUIT CASE.
04:18:35.055: >> Mayor Taylor: IS IT FRIENDLY TO THE BODY. I ASSUME IT IS. ROLL CALL VOTE, STARTING WITH GRISWOLD.
