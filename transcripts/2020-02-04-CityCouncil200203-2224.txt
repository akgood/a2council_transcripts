00:01:15.976: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  MAY I HAVE A MOTION PLEASE PLEASE TO APPROVE THE AGENDA, MOVED BY BY COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, DISCUSSION PLEASE OF THE AGENDA? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
00:01:25.452: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER: THANKS, KATHY. I WAS GOING TO ASK IF WE COULD MOVE DC1 TO AFTER OUR POTENTIALLY CLOSED SESSION TONIGHT. DC1 IS -- YEAH.
00:01:33.727: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU, DC1 TO AFTER THE CLOSED SESSION. FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE AGENDA? CAN I HAVE THAT -- I SUPPOSE WE SHOULD BE VOTING ON THESE, PLEASE. MAY I HAVE THAT BY ACCLIMATION?
00:01:57.517: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  OKAY.
00:01:58.385: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE AGENDA AS AMENDED?
00:02:02.222: >> IS IT POSSIBLE TO HAVE STAFF PULL DS1?
00:02:06.560: >> I'M OKAY WITH THAT.
00:02:13.300: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  YES. PULL IT?
00:02:15.936: >> YES.
00:02:16.637: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  SO REMOVE DS1 FROM THE AGENDA? THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR INDICATOR HIS ASSENT. JUST PULL IT FROM THE AGENDA. STAFF WILL BRING IT BACK, I ASSUME, WHEN IT'S RIGHT AND PROPER.
00:02:30.617: >> YEAH.
00:02:33.220: >> [ OFF MIC ] --
00:02:33.987: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  I THINK IT'S JUST PULLED OFF THE AGENDA, AND THEN IT WILL BE PLACED BACK ON THE AGENDA BY STAFF AT A TIME OF STAFF'S CHOOSING. DS1.
00:02:48.635: >> [ OFF MIC ] --
00:02:51.538: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  SURE. I GUESS -- ALL RIGHT. SO LET'S -- WE ARE GOING TO DO THIS MORE FORMALLY. THERE HAS BEEN A MOTION TO PULL DS1 FROM THE AGENDA. I ASSUME THERE'S A SECOND? SECOND, COUNCILMEMBER LUMM. DISCUSSION?
00:03:03.450: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  YEAH, I JUST FIND THIS APPROACH HIGHLY IRREGULAR, AND I MEAN ARE WE JUST GOING TO START PULLING VARIOUS THINGS FROM THE AGENDA AT RANDOM? OBVIOUSLY NOT. THAT WAS A BIT OF A RHETORICAL QUESTION. BUT I WOULD LIKE US TO KEEP IT ON THE AGENDA, AND THEN IF IT'S TO BE POSTPONED, TABLED, NOT DISCUSSED FURTHER, I WANT TO HEAR WHAT THE -- I WANT TO HEAR WHAT THE CONCERNS ARE RELATIVE TO REMOVING IT. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAD BEEN POSTPONED TO TONIGHT'S AGENDA, AND SO I WOULD LIKE TO RETAIN IT, AND THEN WHEN IT COMES UP IN THE AGENDA, JUST, YOU KNOW, KIND OF STANDARD PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURE, IF YOU WILL. THEN HAVE A COUNCILMEMBER, ANYONE, MOVE TO POSTPONE IT, TABLE IT, WHATEVER.
00:03:54.935: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION?
00:04:00.073: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  JUST BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS REALLY IRREGULAR.
00:04:02.743: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  I GUESS WE ARE AT A ROLL CALL VOTE ON PULLING DS1 FROM THE AGENDA. THIS IS ON THE AMENDMENT OF THE AGENDA TO REMOVE DS1. ROLL CALL VOTE --
00:04:13.053: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  CAN I ASK A FURTHER QUESTION? WHAT IS THE PARLIAMENTARY ROBERT'S RULE THAT ALLOWS US TO DO WHAT WE ARE ABOUT TO VOTE ON?
00:04:23.063: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  I THINK COUNCIL CONTROLS ITS AGENDA.
00:04:25.065: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  RIGHT, BUT WHEN WE REMOVE SOMETHING OR POSTPONE IT, IT COMES UP, WE THEN DO THAT. WE DON'T JUST RANDOMLY YANK STUFF OFF THE AGENDA LIKE THIS.
00:04:37.411: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  I HAD COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI -- LET ME PAUSE FOR A SECOND. LET ME MAKE A -- PARDON ME, BECAUSE I DON'T REALLY CARE IF WE BRING THIS UP. COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD, DO YOU REALLY CARE? CAN WE SUSPEND THIS CONVERSATION AND MOVE ON? I HAD --
00:04:52.559: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  THANK YOU. I CONCUR WITH MY COLLEAGUE, COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
00:04:58.865: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  GREAT.
00:04:59.433: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  I JUST FIND THIS A LITTLE ODD, AND I WOULD LIKE IT TO BE, YOU KNOW, ACTION TAKEN ON THIS WHEN IT COMES UP THROUGH OUR MEETING, THROUGH OUR DISCUSSION.
00:05:09.876: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  RIGHT.
00:05:10.577: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  IT JUST -- I DON'T -- I'LL BE VOTING AGAINST ANY TYPE OF -- THANKS.
00:05:17.017: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER NELSON?
00:05:20.320: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  I GUESS I WOULD HAVE TO CONCUR THAT THIS IS PERHAPS SOMETHING WE DON'T NEED TO TALK ABOUT. HOWEVER, I WAS GOING TO SAY THAT SINCE IT WAS PREVIOUSLY POSTPONED, I DIDN'T REALLY HAVE A PROBLEM PULLING IT, ALTHOUGH IT SEEMED TO ME THAT WE WOULD BE TABLING IT, WOULDN'T WE? THAT'S WHAT WE WOULD BE DOING.
00:05:38.572: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  [ OFF MIC ] --
00:05:39.473: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FAIR POINT. FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE AGENDA AS AMENDED? THAT IS, TO SAY WITH THE REMOVAL -- PARDON ME -- WITH THE ALTERING OF DC1 TO AFTER THE CLOSED SESSION? ALL IN FAVOR? OH, I'M SORRY.
00:05:54.254: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  I JUST HAD A PARLIAMENTARY QUESTION FOR OUR PARLIAMENTARIAN. SO EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE CONTROL OF OUR AGENDA, THIS IS AN ITEM PLACED ON AGENDA BY STAFF. DOES THAT MEAN MR. LAZARUS HAS TO MOVE?
00:06:12.205: >> CITY ADMIN. LAZARUS:  YOU'RE IN CONTROL OF THE AGENDA ONCE IT COMES HERE.  THIS IS AN ITEM THAT COUNCIL HAS ASKED FOR A RESPONSE TO. IF COUNCIL AS A WHOLE WOULD LIKE US TO TAKE ANOTHER ACTION, THAT WOULD BE FINE TOO. AS THE CITY ATTORNEY SAID, IT'S COUNCIL'S AGENDA. I'M OPEN TO EITHER.
00:06:32.058: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU. ALL IN FAVOR OF THE AGENDA AS AMENDED? [ CHORUS OF AYES ]
00:06:37.063: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  AND IT WAS JUST --
00:06:39.032: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  PARDON ME. ALL OPPOSED -- I'LL PULL THAT VOTE BACK, IF I MAY. THERE HAS BEEN ONE AMENDMENT TO THE AGENDA. THAT IS TO SAY, THE MOVE OF DC1 TO AFTER CLOSED SESSION.
00:06:51.077: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  OKAY.
00:06:51.912: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THAT IS THE SOLE AMENDMENT TO THE AGENDA. ALL IN FAVOR OF THE AGENDA AS AMENDED? [ CHORUS OF AYES ] ALL OPPOSED? THE AGENDA AS AMENDED IS APPROVED. ARE THERE COMMUNICATIONS TODAY FROM THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR?
00:07:12.632: >> CITY ADMIN. LAZARUS:  WE DO, MAYOR. I WANT TO CELEBRATE SOME THINGS THAT THE CITY CLERK HAS DONE. AS YOU KNOW, TONIGHT IS THE KICKOFF OF THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN IN A PRETTY BUSY ELECTION SEASON, SO OUR CLERK HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN A LOT OF THINGS THAT WILL MAKE IT EASIER FOR OUR PUBLIC TO VOTE, AS WELL AS SUPPORT THE COUNCIL'S PRIORITY OF ENGAGING MORE PEOPLE IN THE LECTOR -- ELECTORAL PROCESS. MS. BEAUDRY WAS PART OF A NATIONAL TASK FORCE WHICH RELEASED ITS REPORT ON THE BIPARTISAN TASK FORCE ON ELECTIONS, SO HER CONTRIBUTIONS HERE NOT ONLY LOCALLY BUT NATIONALLY ARE SIGNIFICANT AND SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED. ALONG THOSE LINES, THE CITY CLERK'S OFFICE ALSO WON AN NATIONAL ELECTION ASSISTANCE COMMISSION AWARD FOR THE LINE TRACKER, WHICH THEY DID IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN'S SCHOOL OF INFORMATION. WE TALK A LOT ABOUT COLLABORATION WITH OUR BIG NEIGHBOR DOWN THE STREET, AND THIS IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF HOW WE CAN WORK TOGETHER TO BENEFIT OUR PUBLIC. ALONG THOSE LINES AS WELL, CITY CLERK REMINDS US THAT THERE IS A NEW APPEARANCE OF MAILED ABSENTEE BALLOTS, THAT THEY ARE BLUE AND THEY SHOULD NOT BE MISTAKEN FOR JUNK MAIL. SO, PLEASE WATCH IF YOU'VE APPLIED FOR AN ABSENTEE BALLOT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU DON'T MISTAKE IT FOR SOMETHING ELSE. THE FEBRUARY A2 WATER QUALITY MATTERS UPDATE IS ALSO POSTED. I KNOW THAT THERE'S A LOYAL FOLLOWING OF THAT, AND THAT'S AVAILABLE ALSO. SO THOSE ARE THE ITEMS OF INTEREST IN THE ADMINISTRATOR'S UPDATE, AND I ENCOURAGE YOU TO READ THE REST AS WELL. SO, THANK YOU.
00:08:58.071: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU. WE NOW COME TO PUBLIC COMMENT RESERVE -- PARDON ME, PUBLIC COMMENT RESERVE TIME. IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO SPEAK TO COUNCIL AND COMMUNITY ABOUT MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST. TO SPEAK, ONE NEEDS TO HAVE SIGNED UP IN ADVANCE BY CONTACTING OUR CITY CLERK. SPEAKERS HAVE THREE MINUTES IN WHICH TO SPEAK, SO PLEASE PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE TIME CLOCK. AS A MATTER OF COURTESY, WE MAY ONLY HAVE ONE PERSON SPEAKING AT A TIME, AND FINALLY, IF YOU REQUIRE ASSISTANCE IN SPEAKING BEFORE COUNCIL TODAY, WE WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO PROVIDE IT TO YOU.
00:09:34.407: >> OKAY. I HOPE THAT YOU WERE ALL PRESENT WHEN THE E.P.A. REPRESENTATIVE SPOKE VERY CLEARLY ABOUT THE FACT THAT IT COULD TAKE UP TO DECADES, MAYBE 30 YEARS, BEFORE E.P.A. CAN SAY YES OR NO TO CLEANING UP DIOXANE CONTAMINATION OF OUR WATERS. I THINK MANY OF YOU WERE THERE. SHE WAS VERY, VERY CLEAR ABOUT IT. THERE IS NO WAY YOU COULD MISREAD THAT, SO THE C1 PROPOSAL THAT YOU HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU, WHICH CONTINUES THE SAME ROUTE, E.P.A. ROAD TO NEVER, EVER CLEANING UP THE DIOXANE CONTAMINATION, IS DISTURBING. THE PUBLIC IS REALLY SICK AND TIRED. I WALK ON THE STREETS OF ANN ARBOR, PEOPLE HAVE HAD IT. IT'S OVER 30 YEARS. THIS IS -- THIS THING IS GROWING. WE NEED TO PUT THE SHOVEL IN THE GROUND AND CLEAN IT UP RIGHT NOW. WE CAN'T WAIT ANYMORE. THIS E.P.A. PROPOSAL IS JUST ANOTHER 30 YEARS OF USELESS WAITING, USELESS WAITING. WE JUST SAID LET US SPEND A BILLION DOLLARS TO IMPROVE OUR SCHOOLS. I VOTED YES FOR THAT. I AM PROUD TO PAY MORE SO KIDS IN THIS TOWN WILL HAVE BETTER SCHOOLS, BUT I WOULD ALSO LIKE THEM TO DRINK BETTER WATER. I DON'T WANT THEM TO GO TO THE YARD WHERE THERE IS GRASS AND THEY ARE PLAYING, AND WE DON'T KNOW IF THERE IS HIGH LEVELS OF DIOXANE IN IT OR NOT. I WANT THEM TO PLAY IN THE GRASS WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT THEIR SUCKING UP DIOXANE IN THEIR BODIES. I WANT THEM TO DRINK GOOD WATER. SO, THIS CITY COUNCIL AND MANY BEFORE THEM HAVE HAD THIS POSTURE OF, WELL, LET US SEE, AND THAT IS JUST NOT GOOD ENOUGH ANYMORE. YOU HEARD FROM THE WOMAN FROM E.P.A. IT COULD TAKE UP TO 30 YEARS FOR THE E.P.A. TO -- THEY MIGHT EVEN SAY NO, AFTER 30 YEARS OF FEASIBILITY STUDIES, THEY COULD VERY WELL SAY NO, WE DON'T WANT TO DO IT. SO, I ENCOURAGE EVERYONE ONE OF YOU WHO ARE PUSHING FOR THIS RESOLUTION TONIGHT THAT, YOU KNOW, WE SHOULD GO WITH THE E.P.A., I AM TRYING TO TELL YOU, REMEMBER WHAT THE WOMAN SAID. REMEMBER, IT'S BEEN 30 YEARS OR MORE THAT THIS THING HAS BEEN GROWING, POLLUTING OUR WATERS, POLLUTING OUR SOURCES OF DRINKING WATER. IT'S JUST SIMPLY A SHAME. I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW YOU GUYS CAN SIT THERE AND TAKE THIS TO A NEXT LEVEL OF 30 YEARS OF WAITING. HOW CAN YOU DO THAT IN HONEST, GOODNESS -- YOU KNOW, HOW CAN YOU LEAVE THIS FOR THE CHILDREN? HOW? IT'S JUST -- IT BOTHERS ME, AND IT BOTHERS A LOT OF PEOPLE, AND I WANT YOU TO SPEAK UP ABOUT IT, AND NOW YOU DECIDED YOU'RE GOING TO DISCUSS IT LATER? I MEAN, I DON'T UNDERSTAND. YOU'RE POSTPONING TALKING ABOUT IT, C1? WHAT'S GOING ON? I AM -- I'M REALLY UPSET, AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE REALLY UPSET. WE DON'T WANT TO LEAVE THIS TO THE NEXT GENERATION, AND I AM REALLY DISHEARTENED THAT PEOPLE WHO REPRESENT MY WARD, MR. EATON, WHO HAS BEEN HERE FOR SEVEN YEARS, HAVE DONE NOTHING TO FIX IT. FIX IT NOW.
00:12:43.229: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS BLAINE COLEMAN.
00:12:51.404: >> THANKS FOR GIVING ME TIME TO GET THIS SIGN READY. I AM HERE ALSO TO TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE CITY HAS TAKEN 30 YEARS TO NOT CLEAN UP THE DIOXANE, AND THE POSTURE OF THE CITY COUNCIL, AS FAR AS I CAN TELL, IS TO TAKE AN ADDITIONAL 30 YEARS TO NOT CLEAN UP THE DIOXANE, WITH THE EXCUSE THAT AFTER 30 YEARS, THE E.P.A. MIGHT FINISH A FEASIBILITY STUDY AND MIGHT, AT THAT POINT, DECIDE TO START CLEANING UP THE DIOXANE, IF IT SEES FIT. I MEAN, YOU ADD TOGETHER 30 YEARS, ANOTHER 30 YEARS, AND ANOTHER 30 YEARS AFTER THAT, BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A LOT OF YEARS. WHY AM I CARRYING THIS SIGN TONIGHT? I'M SUPPOSED TO BE TALKING ABOUT DIOXANE, RIGHT? IT'S REALLY HARD TO TALK ABOUT ANY SOCIAL IMPROVEMENT WHILE A WAR IS GOING ON FOR DECADES AGAINST THE ARAB WORLD, AGAINST THE ARAB CIVILIZATION, AND AGAINST AFGHANISTAN, AND AGAINST PAKISTAN, AND AGAINST THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE AND AGAINST SOMALIA. THIS IS THE WAR POSTURE THAT THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN SHOVING THE WORLD INTO FOR SO MANY DECADES NOW, AND WE ARE SUPPOSED TO TALK ABOUT CLEANING UP THE ENVIRONMENT. WE ARE SUPPOSED TO TALK ABOUT IMPROVING CHILDREN'S EDUCATION. WE ARE SUPPOSED TO TALK ABOUT MASS TRANSPORTATION AND HOUSING AND ALL OF THESE SOCIAL IMPROVEMENTS, WHILE A MASSIVE MULTITRILLION DOLLAR WAR IS GOING ON, KILLING MILLIONS OF PEOPLE. SO, YES, TONIGHT I AM ALSO ASKING YOU TO JUST PUT YOUR SHOVELS IN THE GROUND AND CLEAN UP THIS DIOXANE CONTAMINATION NOW. YOU CAN DO IT NOW, AND I'M ASKING YOU TO DO IT NOW, BUT I'M ASKING YOU AGAINST A BACKDROP THAT MAKES IT REALLY HARD TO TALK ABOUT THE NEEDS OF SOCIETY BECAUSE THE UNITED STATES AND ITS ALLIES, LIKE ISRAEL, ARE SO BUSY MURDERING ARABS. THEY ARE SO BUSY MURDERING AF AFG AFGHANS, PAKISTANIS, SOMALIS, AND MOST BOLDLY AND OUTRAGEOUSLY, THEY ARE SO BUSY MURDERING THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE. I HOPE THIS CITY COUNCIL WILL NOT ONLY PUT ITS SHOVELS IN THE GROUND AND CLEAN UP THE DIOXANE CONTAMINATION, BUT ALSO FINALLY ALLOW THE RESOLUTION AGAINST MILITARY AID TO ISRAEL TO BE HEARD.
00:15:52.785: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS ERICA BRIGGS.
00:15:59.459: >> GOOD EVENING. I AM HERE TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION AND THE PUBLIC'S ATTENTION TO DC4, A RESOLUTION TO IMPROVE CITY COUNCIL COMMUNICATIONS, SPONSORED BY COUNCILMEMBERS GRISWOLD, EATON AND BANNISTER AND ASK YOU TO VOTE AGAINST IT. THERE ARE NUMEROUS PROBLEMS WITH THIS RESOLUTION, BUT FUNDAMENTALLY IT IS MISLEADING AND EXEMPLIFIES POOR LEADERSHIP. THIS RESOLUTION RESOLVES TO IMPROVE EFFECTIVENESS BY IMPROVING THREE COMPONENTS OF GOVERNMENTAL COMMUNICATION.  THE BIG ISSUE IS THAT THIS RESOLUTION DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE ABOUT IMPROVING COUNCIL COMMUNICATIONS OR FURTHERING THOSE NICE SOUNDING GOALS. RATHER, IT APPEARS IT IS ROOTED IN PARANOIA, A MISTRUST OF STAFF AND RECOMMENDATIONS, AND A SOMEWHAT OBSESSIVE NEED TO MICROMANAGE STAFF. AMONG OTHER THINGS, IT REQUIRES STAFF TO RECORD AND REPORT TO COUNCIL ON MEETINGS THAT THEY ARE HOLDING WITH RESIDENTS, AND PERHAPS THE ODDEST RESOLVE, CITY STAFF AND COUNCILMEMBERS WILL CONTINUE TO STRIVE TO MAKE ACCURATE PUBLIC STATEMENTS AND PUBLICLY ACCURATE INACCURATE STATEMENTS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. AS COUNCIL SURELY KNOWS, GIVEN THE POWER DYNAMIC, STAFF IS GENERALLY UNABLE TO CHALLENGE THE ACCURACY OF COUNCILMEMBER STATEMENTS. WE CAN PRESUME THAT STAFF ARE DOING THEIR BEST TO PROVIDE ACCURATE AND COMPLETE STATEMENTS TO COUNCIL, SO WHILE NOTHING NEW, IT POINTS TO A DISTURBING TREND WE ARE HEARING ALL TOO OFTEN FROM SOME MEMBERS OF COUNCIL. IT SUGGESTS THAT IF A COUNCILMEMBER DOES NOT AGREE WITH STATEMENTS FROM A STAFF MEMBER OR S ADVICE, THEY CALL IT FALSE. IT IS THE JOB OF COUNCIL TO SET POLICY, AND INDEED AT TIMES THAT MAY MEAN DEVIATING FROM STAFF ADVICE, BUT THAT CAN BE DONE WITHOUT SUGGESTING THAT THE FACTS AND ADVICE PROVIDED BY STAFF AREN'T BASED ON DATA AND PROFESSIONAL TRAINING. I URGE YOU TO OPPOSE THIS RESOLUTION AND FURTHER TO STRIVE FOR GREATER CIVILITY AT THIS TABLE, TO TREAT OUR PUBLIC SERVANTS WITH THE RESPECT THEY DESERVE, AND TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE WAY THAT YOU SPEAK AT THIS TABLE AND THE RESOLUTIONS THAT YOU INTRODUCE AFFECT WORKPLACE MORALE, AND THUS THE PRODUCTIVITY AND PERFORMANCE OF CITY STAFF AND OPERATIONS. THANK YOU.
00:18:24.704: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU.
00:18:27.073: >> I HAVE ONE EXTRA SECOND, SO I JUST WANTED TO MENTION --
00:18:30.543: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  MY APOLOGIES.
00:18:32.612: >> THAT'S OKAY. I JUST ALSO WANTED TO MENTION I ALSO OPPOSE DS3. THANK YOU.
00:18:38.584: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS MARILYN --
00:18:44.223: >> VERY GOOD. HI. MY NAME IS MARILYN. I'M A RETIRED SOCIAL WORK PROFESSOR FROM EASTERN MICHIGAN UNIVERSITY, AND I'M HERE REPRESENTING THE CITIZENS FOR MENTAL HEALTH IN PUBLIC SAFETY. OUR MAIN GOAL IS TO ADVOCATE FOR MENTAL HEALTH FUNDING, BOTH IN ANN ARBOR AND FOR WASHTENAW COUNTY. OUR WEBSITE IS A2mentalhealthmillage.COM, AND WE ARE A GROUP OF CONCERNED CITIZENS ADVOCATING THAT THE MONEY ALLOCATED TO THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR FROM THE NOVEMBER 2017 MENTAL HEALTH AND PUBLIC SAFETY MILLAGE BE USED FOR EXACTLY THAT, FOR PUBLIC SAFETY AND FOR MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS. WE ALSO URGE COUNTY OFFICIALS TO ADEQUATELY FUND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN THE COUNTY. OUR FOCUS IS HOW SHOULD THE MILLAGE REVENUE BE ALLOCATED TO THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR, HOW SHOULD IT BE SPENT. WHAT IS AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF FUNDING FOR MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS FROM THE GENERAL FUNDS OF THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR, WASHTENAW COUNTY AND THE STATE OF MICHIGAN? WE ALL KNOW THAT CURRENT FUNDING IS INADEQUATE, AND MORE IS NEEDED FOR OUR MOST VULNERABLE AND UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS, THOSE COPING WITH A MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION AND THEIR LOVED ONES WHO SUPPORT THEM. GLENN NELSON, ALSO A MEMBER OF OUR COMMITTEE, WILL SPEAK AFTER ME TO TALK MORE DIRECTLY ABOUT THE FUNDING ISSUES. WHEN THE MILLAGE WAS PROMOTED, PEOPLE THOUGHT THEY WERE VOTING TO HELP MEET THIS NEED OF MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES, AND VOTING FOR THE 2017 MENTAL HEALTH AND PUBLIC SAFETY MILLAGE. UNFORTUNATELY, SOME OF THOSE FUNDS EARMARKED FOR MENTAL HEALTH WERE DIVERTED TO ANOTHER ISSUE ALL TOGETHER. THOUGH AN IMPORTANT ISSUE, IT'S NOT WHAT PEOPLE VOTED FOR. THIS WAS AT THE EXPENSE OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE AND UNDERSERVED. PERHAPS YOU THOUGHT NO ONE WOULD SPEAK UP FOR THAT GROUP, BUT THAT IS EXACTLY WHY WE ARE HERE. WHEN A CITIZEN VOTES FOR A MILLAGE, IT'S A SACRED TRUST, THAT WHAT THEY ARE VOTING FOR WILL BE WHAT THE MONEY IS SPENT FOR. WE URGE YOU TO RECONSIDER YOUR EARLIER DECISION. THERE'S STILL TIME. THERE'S STILL YEARS FOR THIS MILLAGE, AND FOR THE FUNDING TO GO TO THE AREA OF MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS IN THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR, PLEASE SUPPORT THE PUBLIC TRUST OF HAVING PEOPLE GET WHAT THEY VOTED FOR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
00:21:27.253: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS GLENN NELSON.
00:21:41.634: >> HI. I'M GLENN NELSON, ONE OF THE LEADERS OF CITIZENS FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND PUBLIC SAFETY. I APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT PART OF OUR BUDGET RECOMMENDATION OF OUR GROUP. THE TIME IS TOO SHORT TO PRESENT ALL OF IT. WE WILL BE DOING OTHER PARTS OVER THE COMING WEEKS. I WILL PROVIDE THE CLERK WITH COPIES OF OUR COMPLETE RECOMMENDATION. WE WELCOME A DIALOGUE WITH YOU, IF YOU SEE WAYS TO MAKE THE RECOMMENDATIONS EVEN MORE EFFECTIVE IN IMPROVING THE LIVES OF THOSE LIVING WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. I WILL EMPHASIZE FOR NEW INITIATIVES, PUTTING ASIDE FOR NOW ENDORSEMENTS FOR SEVERAL OF THE POLICIES YOU CURRENTLY SUPPORT. OUR GROUP SUPPORTS TWO NEW INITIATIVES THAT PRIMARILY REQUIRE LEADERSHIP IN CHANGING CULTURE AND ONLY SMALL APPROPRIATIONS. THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR SHOULD BE CHARGED WITH, ONE, EMPHASIZE ALL CITY EMPLOYEES SHOULD CONDUCT ALL FACETS OF CITY BUSINESS, WITH ATTENTION AND CONCERN FOR THOSE LIVING WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. AND, TWO, FORMULATE AND IMPLEMENT A PLAN TO DEMONSTRATE ANN ARBOR IS AN ENTHUSIASTIC PARTNER IN A COUNTY-LED EFFORT TO MAKE WASHTENAW COUNTY A STIGMA-FREE COMMUNITY WITH RESPECT TO MENTAL HEALTH STATUS. WE SUGGEST $50,000 BE APPROPRIATED FOR THE ASSOCIATED EXPENSES OF THESE. THIRD, WE SUPPORT A NEW APPROACH TO THE FUNDS FROM THE MILLAGE FOCUSED ON CLIMATE CHANGE ACTIONS IN FISCAL YEAR 2020. WE SUPPORT APPROPRIATING FUNDS FOR PROGRAMS THAT SERVE BOTH THOSE LIVING WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND THOSE DESIRING ACTIONS TO REDUCE OUR CARBON FOOTT. FOR EXAMPLE, THE FUNDS COULD BE USED TO INSTALL SOLAR ARRAYS DEDICATED TO THE ELECTRICAL NEEDS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR THOSE REQUIRING SUPPORTIVE SERVICES, THUS REDUCING THE OPERATING COST OF THIS HOUSING. YOU HAVE APPROPRIATELY STIPULATED THAT EQUITY MUST BE AT THE CENTER OF THE A20 POLICY, AND CORRECTLY STATED EQUITY MEANS EVERYONE GETS THE SUPPORT THEY NEED. THERE IS NO MORE EQUITABLE USE OF MILLAGE FUNDS DEVOTED TO SUSTAINABILITY THAN USES WHICH SIMULTANEOUSLY IMPROVE THE LIVES OF THOSE LIVING WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. WE RECOMMEND $950,000 BE APPROPRIATED FOR THESE EXPENSES. FOURTH, OUR GROUP SUPPORTS THE CITY BECOMING A PARTNER AND PLANNING AND FUNDING A PLACE, PERHAPS CALLED AN ASSESSMENT CENTER, WHICH WILL ACCEPT JUVENILES PICKED UP BY THE ANN ARBOR POLICE, BUT IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE FOR THEM TO GO HOME BUT NOT TO JUVENILE DETENTION. EVERY JURISDICTION WITH A POLICE DEPARTMENT SHOULD SHARE --
00:24:51.890: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU.
00:24:53.058: >> -- IN THIS ENDEAVOR. THERE WILL BE MORE LATER SINCE I RAN OUT OF TIME.
00:24:58.063: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAK IS ABU IBRAHIM. ABU IBRAHIM. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS MOLLY CLYMAN.
00:25:18.751: >> HELLO. MY NAME IS MOLLY CLINEMAN. I SERVE AS THE CHAIR OF THE ANN ARBOR TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION, BUT I'M NOT REPRESENTING THE COMMISSION THIS EVENING. MY COMMENTS ARE MY OWN. I'M HERE TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO VOTE AGAINST DC3, THE RULINGS TO ESTABLISH CITY COUNCIL MOBILITY COMMITTEE, WHICH DID NOT COME BEFORE THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION FOR REVIEW, DESPITE BEING WITHIN THE COMMISSION'S MISSION. ACCORDING TO THE ANN ARBOR CITY CODE, THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION WAS ESTABLISHED TO FOSTER EXCELLENCE IN THE PLANNING, DESIGN, CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE OF A SUSTAINABILITY AND RESILIENT MULTIMODAL TRANSPORTATION NETWORK FOR THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. THE COMMISSION SERVES AS AN ADVISORY BODY TO THE CITY COUNCIL AND THE ADMINISTRATOR ON TRANSPORTATION POLICY, WITH A FOCUS ON ACCESSIBILITY, MOBILITY, EQUITY AND SAFETY FOR ALL. THE PURPOSE AND ACTIONS OF THIS PROPOSED CITY COUNCIL MOBILITY COMMITTEE WOULD DUPLICATE THE EFFORTS OF THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION WITH LESS PUBLIC PARTICIPATION AND OVERSIGHT. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE AAATA AND CITY COUNCIL, TRANSPORTATION COMMISSIONERS ARE UNPAID VOLUNTEERS WHO HAVE DEMONSTRATED A DEEP COMMITMENT TO IMPROVING OUR CITY'S MOBILITY SYSTEMS FOR EVERYONE, REGARDLESS OF THEIR MODE OF TRANSPORTATION. WE ARE BIKE COMMUTERS AND TRANSIT USERS. WE ARE DRIVERS AND PEDESTRIANS. WE ARE PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND PARENTS OF CHILDREN, LOCAL BUSINESS OWNERS AND MEMBERS OF COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS. WE SERVE ON THIS COMMISSION BECAUSE WE WANT TO HELP MAKE ANN ARBOR A SAFER, GREENER, FRIENDLIER PLACE TO LIVE AND WORK. IN 2019, A COUNCILMEMBER WAS ABSENT FROM FIVE OF THE 12 MONTHLY COMMISSION MEETINGS AND MISSED MORE THAN HALF OF TWO ADDITIONAL MEETINGS. IF CITY COUNCIL WANTS TO WORK WITH STAFF AND ENGAGE WITH THE PUBLIC AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS REGARDING MOBILITY POLICIES, IT SHOULD APPOINT A REPRESENTATIVE WHO WILL PARTICIPATE FULLY IN TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE MEETINGS, INSTEAD OF CREATING ITS OWN PRIVATE COMMITTEE WHICH INCLUDES NO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC AND OPERATES OUTSIDE THE CITY'S BOARD STRUCTURE. COUNCIL HAS TAKEN FOR ITSELF THE POWER TO CANCEL PLANNED BIKE LANES ON SIDEWALKS. IT VOTES ON TEMPORARY LANE CLOSURES AND CHANGES TO PARKING CONFIGURATIONS. IT REGULARLY OVERRULES THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF CITY STAFF AND EXPERT CONSULTANTS, AS WELL AS THE RESULTS OF A PUBLIC OPINION SURVEY THAT COUNCIL ITSELF REQUESTED. CREATED A CITY COUNCIL MOBILITY COMMITTEE WOULD ONLY FURTHER INSULATE CITY COUNCIL FROM THE DESIRES AND REALITIES FROM PEOPLE WHOSE LIVES ARE DIFFERENT THAN THEIR OWN. RATHER THAN CONSULT A DIVERSE GROUP, CITY COUNCIL WOULD CONSULT ONLY ITSELF. I HOPE YOU ALL VOTE AGAINST DC3. THANK YOU.
00:27:59.645: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU. ARE THERE COMMUNICATIONS TODAY FROM COUNCIL? COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
00:28:07.352: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRAND:  I WOULD, AS A MEMBER OF THE COUNCIL ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE, LIKE TO REMIND ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES ON COUNCIL THAT EVALUATIONS FOR THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR AND THE CITY ATTORNEY ARE DUE ON FEBRUARY 7TH. I MYSELF HAD THEM GO TO MY "OTHER" INSTEAD OF "FOCUSED" FOLDER, SO YOU MAY NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AND SEE IF THEY ARE HIDING THERE. IF YOU SEARCH FOR THE PROVIDER, YOU WILL FIND THEM. IF YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEMS, LET ME KNOW, AND I'LL GET IN TOUCH WITH OUR CONSULTANT ON THAT PROJECT. I WOULD ALSO JUST LIKE TO THANK WARD 3 RESIDENT SUE HANSON, ROBERT GORDON, AND LISA FOR ORGANIZING OUR NEIGHBORHOOD CLIMATE CHANGE GATHERING LAST WEEK. DR. MISSY STULTS FROM OUR OFFICE OF SUSTAINABILITY AND INNOVATION JOINED US THERE. IT WAS WELL ATTENDED AT PITTSFIELD ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. WE HAD DOZENS OF NEIGHBORS THERE, WHO WERE ABLE TO ASK QUESTIONS AS A GROUP AND ENGAGE IN BREAKOUT SESSIONS. I THINK EVERY SINGLE RESIDENT WHO WAS THERE GOT TO LEARN MORE WANT WHAT THE CITY WAS DOING TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE AND FEEL LIKE THEY COULD BE PART OF A SOLUTION AND HAVE INPUT AS WE GO FORWARD, AND THERE WILL BE SOME MORE OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE'LL BE ALERTING YOU TO IN THE FUTURE COMING UP FOR PUBLIC INPUT REGARDING THOSE EFFORTS, BUT TO ME, IT WAS ALSO JUST A GREAT OPPORTUNITY NOT ONLY TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS BUT ALSO FOR RESIDENTS JUST REALLY TO LEARN ABOUT THE EXPERTISE THAT WE HAVE ON OUR STAFF AND TO APPRECIATE JUST THE DEPTH AND BREADTH OF WHAT WE HAVE GOING ON IN THE CITY RELATED TO CLIMATE CHANGE, SO THANK YOU TO DR. STULTS FOR TAKING TIME OUT OF HER EVENING TO SPEND TIME WITH THOSE NEIGHBORS, AND TO ALL OF THOSE NEIGHBORS FOR COMING OUT.
00:29:52.991: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER COMMUNICATIONS FROM COUNCIL? COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
00:29:58.430: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD:  THIS IS REALLY A PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT. I WOULD LIKE TO REMIND EVERYONE LISTENING THAT IT IS CRITICAL THAT YOU USE OUR A2 FIX IT APPLICATION TO REPORT SIDEWALKS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN SIDEWALKS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN ADEQUATELY SHOVELED AND ARE FREE OF ICE, AS WELL AS STREETLIGHT OUTAGES. WE HAD A SENIOR IN OUR COMMUNITY SLIP ON AN ICY SIDEWALK AND DIE THE LAST -- JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO, SO FOR ANYONE LISTENING, IT'S -- THERE'S A REASON WHY WE NEED TO KEEP OUR SIDEWALKS FREE OF ICE AND SNOW. I ALSO SERVE ON ONE OF THE SEMCOG COMMITTEES, AND I WAS GIVEN A REPORT THAT I'LL BE SHARING WITH COUNCIL AND HOPEFULLY PUTTING IN THE COUNCIL PACKET SO THAT THE COMMUNITY CAN SEE IT, ABOUT THE IMPROVEMENT IN THE PEDESTRIAN CRASH RATE THAT WAS REALIZED IN DETROIT AFTER THEY MADE A MAJOR INVESTMENT IN STREET LIGHTING, AND IT SHOWS JUST HOW CRITICAL STREETLIGHTS ARE FOR PEDESTRIAN SAFETY. THE LAST THING IS I WAS ASKED TO SERVE ON ANOTHER MOBILITY COMMITTEE, AND THIS IS THE MOBILITY TECHNICAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE WITHIN THE OFFICE OF SUSTAINABILITY, SO WE DO HAVE MANY COMMITTEES AND  TASK FORCES WORKING ON THE ISSUE OF MOBILITY AT THIS TIME.
00:31:29.955: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER COMMUNICATION FROM COUNCIL? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
00:31:35.060: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. YEAH, I WANTED TO SEND OUT MY CONDOLENCES TO THE FRIENDS AND FAMILY OF MR. DEREK, WHO PASSED AFTER SLIPPING ON AN UNSHOVELED SIDEWALK HERE IN THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. UNBELIEVABLE, A FIRST WARD RESIDENT, OLD FOURTH WARD AREA, A SUPER NICE, FRIENDLY GUY, AND REALLY A GREAT GUY. SO I MOVE TO -- I MOVE TO HAVE A COUPLE OF QUICK COMMENTS. SO AC1, WHICH IS THE S.P.A.R.K. ANNUAL REPORT, I ALREADY SENT AN EMAIL TO OUR L.D.F.A. LIAISON AND MR. LAZARUS, BECAUSE I EXPRESSED CONCERNS THAT THE REPORT ISN'T COMPLETELY TRANSPARENT BECAUSE WE USED CODE NUMBERS TO DISCUSS THE COMPANIES THAT WE ARE INVESTING IN, AND SO I HAVE ASKED FOR A KEY TO THAT SO WE CAN FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON, AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN WORK OUT A WAY THAT THAT IS ACTUALLY PUBLIC -- BECOMES A PUBLIC MATTER, BECAUSE THEY ARE USING A MIX OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE FUNDS, BUT IT'S INVESTED UNDER THE WATCHFUL EYE OF L.D.F.A. S.P.A.R.K. IS SORT OF A VENDOR. IT'S A LITTLE BIT CONVOLUTED, BUT S.P.A.R.K.X. IS A VENDOR FOR L.D.F.A. SO I THINK THAT'S CLOSE ENOUGH THAT IT IS A PUBLIC MATTER. I HAVE ASKED FOR THAT, AND I HAVE RECEIVED ASSURANCES THAT THERE ARE REASONS IT ISN'T IN THE PUBLIC REPORT, BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT I AGREE WITH THEM YET. WE'LL HAVE TO SEE HOW THAT -- SECONDLY, I MOVED TO HAVE DC1 MOVED BECAUSE -- I HAD THE PLEASURE OF MEETING WITH THE GELMAN ATTORNEYS AND OUR COMPETENT LEGAL STAFF FROM ALL OF THE INTERVENING PARTIES, BUT I'LL LET MR. POSTEMA SPEAK TO THAT. I THINK IT'S WORTH THE CONVERSATION THAT WE'LL HAVE IN THE CLOSED SESSION. I'LL JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
00:33:22.134: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER COMMUNICATION FROM COUNCIL? COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
00:33:24.769: >> COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER AND I WOULD LIKE TO INVITE THE WHOLE COMMUNITY TO JOIN US ON SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 9TH, FOR A MEET THE CANDIDATES FOR WASHTENAW COUNTY PROSECUTOR. WE ARE GOING TO BE JOINED ON SUNDAY AFTERNOON FROM 1:00-2:30 WITH ARIANNE SLAY, HUGO MACK, AND ELLIE -- SO THAT WILL TAKE PLACE AT THE ERRWOOD COMMUNITY CENTER, AND EVERYONE IS WELCOME TO JOIN US ON THIS IMPORTANT GET TO KNOW THE CANDIDATES. AND THEN ALSO, COMING UP AT OUR NEXT MEETING OF COUNCIL ON -- IT'S NOT GOING TO BE ON PRESIDENT'S DAY, FEBRUARY 17. IT WILL BE THE FOLLOWING DAY, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 18, AND LEGISTAR HAS NOT BEEN UPDATED YET WITH RESOLUTION 3 FOR THE BARTON DRIVE SIDEWALK PROJECT, ALTHOUGH THE JULY RESOLUTION 1 AND 2 HAD INDICATED THAT THE SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS WOULD BE BACK ON THE CALENDAR FOR FEBRUARY 18, SO I JUST WANTED TO GIVE A CALLOUT TO THE NEIGHBORS WHO ARE INTERESTED IN THAT TO FEEL FREE TO EMAIL COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER AND ME WITH YOUR LATEST THOUGHTS ABOUT THE SIDEWALK ASSESSMENTS AS THEY ARE ANTICIPATED TO BE ON COUNCIL'S AGENDA FOR THE NEXT MEETING, FEBRUARY 18TH. THANK YOU.
00:35:00.398: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER COMMUNICATION FROM COUNCIL? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
00:35:02.734: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  THANK YOU. JUST READING THROUGH THE ADMINISTRATOR'S REPORT, I HAVE NOTICED IN THE ORDINANCE'S SECOND READING FOR TONIGHT, WHERE WE AMENDED THE AGE FROM 16 TO 25, BUT IN THIS PUBLICATION, I THINK IT STILL SHOWS THE 14, AS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE AND ISSUES THAT SURROUND IT. IN FACT, I'M HAVING AN EARLY MEETING TOMORROW WITH A CONSTITUENT TO HELP BRING ME UP TO SPEED WITH WHAT THAT REALLY MEANS, WHAT KIND OF ACTIONS REALLY NEED TO BE TAKEN, IF WE ARE GOING TO BE SERIOUS ABOUT MEETING THAT GOAL BY 2030. I WAS THINKING TODAY THAT PROBABLY NONE OF US WILL BE UP HERE IN 2030, AND SO WE CAN MAKE THESE PROMISES AND WE CAN MAKE THESE RESOLUTIONS AND COMMITMENTS, BUT ARE WE GOING TO BE UP HERE IN TEN YEARS TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE? THIS HAS BROUGHT UP MANY TIMES NOW SINCE WE DECLARED THE CLIMATE EMERGENCY. NOW EVERY ACTION THAT'S BEING TAKEN IS BEING LOOKED AT THROUGH A NEW LENS. I UNDERSTAND THERE WAS AN INVITATION FOR MEMBERS OF OUR CITY COUNCIL AND THE MAYOR TO GO TO GERMANY TO DISCUSS CLIMATE ACTION. WE HAVE MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY WHO HAVE SOME STRONG OBJECTIONS TO THIS. I WOULD OFFER THAT, IN TEN YEARS FROM NOW, IF WE ACHIEVE OUR GOALS, WE CAN TAKE THAT FLIGHT, BUT I REALLY DO THINK IT SENDS THE WRONG MESSAGE TO OUR COMMUNITY, TO THE TAXPAYERS, TO OTHER MEMBERS ON THIS CITY COUNCIL WHEN WE GET ON A PLANE AND FLY ACROSS THE OCEAN USING TAXPAYER DOLLARS TO TALK ABOUT CLIMATE ACTION. I DON'T KNOW, PERHAPS I'M MISSING SOMETHING, AND MORE CAN BE EXPLAINED TO ME AS TO WHY THIS WILL NEED TO BE -- HAVE TO HAPPEN. AT THIS POINT, I'M UNCONVINCED THAT THIS IS A WISE ENDEAVOR, AND I URGE TO RECONSIDER THAT INVITATION AND POLITEFULLY REJECT IT AND SAY WHEN WE MEET OUR GOALS IN 2030, WE'LL BE THERE, AND INSTEAD TAKE THAT MONEY AND PUT IT INTO MEASURES THAT ACTUALLY SEQUESTER CARBON RATHER THAN EMIT CARBON.
00:37:44.996: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER COMMUNICATION FROM COUNCIL? I NOTE THAT ONE MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC WHO WAS HERE -- WHO WISHED TO BE HERE FOR PUBLIC COMMENT SIGNED UP FOR PUBLIC COMMENT BUT THEN JUST ARRIVED AFTER COUNCIL COMMUNICATION STARTED. AS WE HAD FEWER THAN TEN MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC COME SPEAK, I'M ASKING COUNCIL'S ACQUIESCENCE TO HAVING THE MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC GIVE HIS THREE MINUTES. ANY OBJECTION? SO, REOPENING PUBLIC COMMENTARY, MR. IBRAHIM, THREE MINUTES, AT YOUR PLEASURE.
00:38:28.139: >> GOOD EVENING. I WANT TO ADDRESS THE COUNCIL ON A MATTER THAT I HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH FOR THE LAST NINE YEARS. FIRST, LET ME INTRODUCE MYSELF. MY NAME IS ABU IBRAHIM. I'M A 26-YEAR-OLD. I HAVE BEEN A RESIDENT OF ANN ARBOR FOR THE LAST 20 YEARS, AND SO HAVE MY FAMILY MEMBERS. MY FAMILY OWNS A SMALL BUSINESS. WE TRY TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO GIVE BACK TO THE COMMUNITY AND STAY OUT OF TROUBLE. I PERSONALLY HAVE NO CRIMINAL RECORD. I HAVE NO TRAFFIC RECORD. BUT LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS, ALMOST TEN YEARS. LAST SEPTEMBER, I WAS SEEKING A JOB AT UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN WHEN THEY TOLD ME THAT I COULD NOT PROCEED WITH MY EMPLOYMENT BECAUSE I WAS A FELON, WHICH DIDN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME. SO I LOOKED INTO IT. I GOT A REPORT FROM THE MICHIGAN STATE POLICE, IN WHICH THEY LIST EIGHT PAGES OF MISDEMEANORS AND FELONIES THAT I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH. I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT MY NAME IS LINKED TO 44 OTHER ALIASES, AND I HAVE TALKED TO MULTIPLE MEMBERS OF COUNCIL ABOUT THIS OVER THE YEARS, TO TRY TO ADDRESS IT, TO TRY TO FIX IT, WHAT CAN BE DONE ABOUT IT. THERE IS STILL NO RESOLUTION TO MY PROBLEM. I HAVE A HUGE TARGET ON MY BACK, EVERY TIME I'M STOPPED BY THE POLICE, WHETHER I'M DRIVING, WHETHER I'M BEING DETAINED, IT DOESN'T MATTER. THIS HAS PUT MY LIFE IN DANGER. TO ADD TO MY PLIGHT, IT'S GOT ME KICKED OUT OF SCHOOL, FIRED FROM JOBS. I PAID THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN FINES TO THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR, FINES THAT THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR HAD TOLD ME, JUDGES AND POLICE OFFICERS, THAT THEY KNOW THAT AREN'T MY FINES, BUT I HAVE TO PAY THEM ANYWAY, WHICH DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME. I WAS SCHEDULED TO MEET WITH THE CHIEF OF POLICE LAST WEEK, WHEN HE UNEXPECTEDLY CANCELLED MY MEETING. I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHY. AFTER I PUT IN MY COMPLAINT IN LAST SEPTEMBER WITH LIEUTENANT BONNY [ OFF MIC ] FROM THE ANN ARBOR POLICE DEPARTMENT, SPECIAL STANDARDS DIVISION, SHE RECENTLY TOLD ME, IN JANUARY, THAT THIS COMPLAINT HAS BEEN REVIEWED, AND ALL OF THE OFFICERS INVOLVED WITH MY COMPLAINT WERE EXONERATED. THIS COMPLAINT IS TIED TO A DASH CAM VIDEO OF FOUR OFFICERS COMING TO MY HOUSE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, HARASSING ME, INTERROGATING ME, ILLEGALLY HOLDING ME AND THEN TAKING ME TO JAIL ILLEGALLY WITHOUT ANY CHARGES. I HAVE ASKED THAT THE POLICE DEPARTMENT RELEASE THIS VIDEO TO THE I.C.P.O.C. AND THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION. THEY STILL HAVE NOT RELEASED THE VIDEO AND THE INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN CLOSED PERTAINING TO MY COMPLAINT. I JUST WANTED TO LET YOU GUYS KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON, MAKE YOU AWARE OF THE SITUATION, AND NOW IT'S PUBLIC INFORMATION NOW. SO, THANK YOU.
00:41:29.988: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU. I WOULD LIKE TO REQUEST CONFIRMATION OF THE FOLLOWING APPOINTMENT THAT WAS PRESENTED TO COUNCIL FOR CONSIDERATION ON THE JANUARY 21, 2020, REGULAR MEETING, AN APPOINTMENT OF ROBERT WHITE. DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [ CHORUS OF AYES ] OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. WE NOW HAVE BEFORE US THE CONSENT AGENDA. MAY I HAVE A MOTION PLEASE TO APPROVE THE CONSENT AGENDA? DISCUSSION OF THE CONSENT AGENDA, COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
00:42:06.824: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  WITH THE BODY'S INDULGENCE, I WOULD LOOIC TO REMOVE CA5 AND CA9 FOR DISCUSSION.
00:42:14.165: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE CONSENT AGENDA? COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
00:42:17.068: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  I DIDN'T WANT TO PULL THE ITEM, BUT I DO WANT TO COMMENT ON CA2. ANNUALLY, THE N.I.T. WHICH IS NOW KNOWN AS THE A.L.L.I.A.N.C.E. BRINGS A CONFERENCE TO TOWN. A LOT OF PEOPLE COME, A LOT OF PEOPLE SPEND MONEY IN OUR TOWN, AND WE ARE REALLY FORTUNATE TO HAVE THEM COME BECAUSE THEY HAVE REMOVED THEIR PRESENCE FROM OTHER STATES AFTER THE STATES PASSED RIGHT TO WORK LAWS. THIS IS BASICALLY A LABOR ORGANIZATION, BUT THEY MAINTAIN THEIR PRESENCE HERE, BECAUSE, IN FACT, ANN ARBOR IS FRIENDLY TO LABOR. ANN ARBOR HAS A LOCAL ORDINANCE ON PREVAILING WAGES, AND SO THEY RECOGNIZE US AS THE KIND OF ALLIES THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO ASSOCIATE WITH, AND SO THEY HAVE MAINTAINED THIS ACTIVITY IN OUR TOWN, AND WE ARE FORTUNATE TO HAVE THIS.
00:43:06.250: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE CONSENT AGENDA? COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
00:43:09.353: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I JUST HAD A CLARIFYING QUESTION. CA7 IS LINED THROUGH. ARE WE TO INTERPRET THAT WE ARE NOT VOTING ON THAT THIS EVENING?
00:43:19.931: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THAT'S CORRECT. SEVEN AND 11 ARE REMOVED BY STAFF. FURTHER DISCUSSION? THE CONSENT AGENDA WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CA 5, 9, 11 IS APPROVED, 11 COUNCILMEMBERS ARE PRESENT, THUS SATISFYING THE 8-VOTE REQUIREMENT WITH RESPECT TO CA5, CA6 -- PARDON ME, NOT CA5, MY APOLOGIES, CA6. CA5, RESOLUTION TO APPROVE RIVERSIDE PARK PARKING LOT LAND LEASE WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRAND, SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER. DISCUSSION, PLEASE, OF CA5? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
00:44:06.978: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I SENT TO OUR CLERK A WHEREAS AND RESOLVED CLAUSE THAT I WOULD LIKE TO ADD TO THIS RESOLUTION, AND I'LL READ THEM OUT LOUD. THE WHEREAS RESOLUTION -- AND THE RESOLVED CLAUSE IS RESOLVED THESE 18 PARKING SPACES SHALL BE RESERVED FOR ZERO EMISSIONS VEHICLES. AND SO THE REASON I'M ASKING FOR THIS IS NOT THAT WE DON'T SEE THE BENEFITS OF RENTING SPACES IN OUR PARKING LOTS TO UNIVERSITY IN A PARTIAL MANNER. THAT MONEY GOES INTO THE PARKS GENERAL FUND, WHICH IS NEEDED AND USED, AND BUT I, AS COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI SPOKE TO JUST A FEW MOMENTS AGO, WE NEED TO BE LOOKING AT EVERY ACTION THIS CITY TAKES THROUGH THIS LENS OF THIS CLIMATE EMERGENCY THAT WE ALL AGREED WAS UPON US. AND SO IF WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SUBLEASE SOME OF OUR PROPERTY FOR A CERTAIN USE, WE SHOULD MAKE CERTAIN THAT THAT USE DOESN'T BRING 18 CARBON CARS INTO OUR CITY EVERY DAY, AND IT'S ONE OF THE FEW OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE HAVE TO LEAN ON THE UNIVERSITY TO UPHOLD THEIR END OF IT, AND I REALLY BELIEVE THAT IT IS APPROPRIATE AND RIGHT TO SUGGEST THAT THAT THEY SAY, HEY, THAT'S PRIME SPOTS FOR ZERO EMISSIONS VEHICLES, WHATEVER TYPE THEY ARE THAT FIT THAT BROAD DEFINITION, I'M HAPPY TO WELCOME 18 ZERO EMISSIONS VEHICLES INTO THAT PARKING LOT. OTHERWISE, I DON'T THINK THAT WE SHOULD DO IT. IT'S BAD ENOUGH THAT THEY ARE PUTTING OVER 2000 PARKING SPOTS IN THAT SAME NEIGHBORHOOD. I LOOK TO ADD THAT RESOLUTION AND THAT WHEREAS CLAUSE.
00:45:44.208: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  IS THERE A SECOND? SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER EATON. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, YOU STILL HAVE THE FLOOR.
00:45:49.447: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  IT'S PRETTY SELF-EVIDENT AFTER THAT EXPLANATION WHY WE SHOULD BE DOING THIS. WE HAVE TOLD OURSELVES WE NEED TO BE LOOKING FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO LEVERAGE OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE UNIVERSITY, AND THEY EXIST AND COME BEFORE US ALL THE TIME, AND I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS OPPORTUNITY.
00:46:05.429: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
00:46:06.497: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  I WOULD LIKE TO ASK THE SPONSOR OF THIS RESOLUTION IF HE WOULD CONSIDER A NUMBER LOWER THAN ALL. IF YOU LOOK AT JUST THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF CAR OWNERSHIP RIGHT NOW, THERE'S NO GROUP THAT HAS 100% ELECTRIC VEHICLES AT THIS VERY MOMENT.
00:46:24.882: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  WELL, I MEAN, YOU CAN NAME A NUMBER, BUT WE ACTUALLY LEASE 600 SPACES CITY-WIDE TO THE UNIVERSITY, AND BETWEEN ALL OF OUR STRUCTURES AND PARKS, INCLUDING FULLER PARK, SO THIS IS JUST ONE OPPORTUNITY TO CHOP AWAY AT THAT, SO FEEL FREE TO PUT FORWARD A NUMBER.
00:46:44.635: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  I RELEASE MY TIME TO MS. LUMM HERE.
00:46:48.506: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  WELL, I HAVE GOT RAMLAWI, ACKERMAN, LUMM ON THE QUEUE, AND THEN GRAND. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
00:46:54.879: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  THIS IS ON THE AMENDMENT, NOT ON THE MOTION?
00:46:58.683: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  ON THE MOTION.
00:46:59.817: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  I WILL WANT TO SPEAK ON THE MAIN MOTION LATER AS WELL. ON THE AMENDMENT, IS THERE A TRULY ZERO EMISSIONS VEHICLE? YOU KNOW, EVEN YOUR ELECTRIC VEHICLES WILL REQUIRE ELECTRICITY PRODUCED WITH CARBON, UNFORTUNATELY, SO WE END UP NOT HAVING A ZERO CARBON, YOU KNOW, IN ACTUALITY. I DO APPRECIATE THE SPIRIT THAT THIS IS COMING UNDER. I DO WANT TO SPEAK TO IT UNDER THE MAIN MOTION, WHEN WE TALK ABOUT IT MORE, BUT I JUST PAUSE TO SAY I DON'T THINK THERE'S EFFECTIVELY ZERO CARBON EMISSIONS WITH HOW WE PRODUCE THIS ENERGY.
00:47:42.326: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
00:47:43.227: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I HAVE GOT A COUPLE OF THOUGHTS. I THINK ON ITS FACE, I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING AGAINST THIS. I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN A CHANCE TO RESPOND TO IT, SO IF THIS PASSES, I WOULD LIKE TO POSTPONE THIS, AND I LIKE THE IDEA IF WE ARE GOING TO START THE CONVERSATION, AT LEAST START HIGH WITH ALL OF THEM AND SEE WHERE IT GOES. THE ONLY OTHER THOUGHT I HAVE IS, YOU KNOW, THIS IS ON PARKS GROUND, AND THIS WOULD REQUIRE A FAIR AMOUNT OF INFRASTRUCTURE TO BE LAID DOWN, AND IT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT IDEALLY WE WOULD -- IDEALLY, WE WOULD NO LONGER HAVE -- WE WOULD MOVE THE UNIVERSITY OFF OF THIS SITE AND USE IT AGAIN IN THE FUTURE AS PARK AND ENCOURAGING THE UNIVERSITY TO LAY DOWN E.V. INFRASTRUCTURE SEEMS LIKE IT WOULD BE COUNTERINTUITIVE TO THOSE GOALS -- OR COUNTER-PRODUCTIVE TO THOSE GOALS. SO, A COUPLE OF THOUGHTS THERE. I THINK, AGAIN, ON ITS FACE, I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING AGAINST IT, BUT IF IT DOES PASS, I THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD TO POSTPONE TO GIVE THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN A CHANCE TO RESPOND.
00:48:46.390: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
00:48:47.224: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  THANKS, MR. MAYOR. TO THE AMENDMENT, I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION THAT WAS POSED BY COUNCILMEMBER EATON AND COMMENTED ON BY COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI ABOUT, YOU KNOW, ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES, AND MY CONCERN WITH REGARD TO THE AMENDMENT IS THIS REQUIREMENT WOULD NOT ONLY BE MADE OF THE UNIVERSITY FOLKS WHO USE THESE 18 SPACES, AND I WILL SAY THIS, YOU KNOW, UNDERSTANDING THE SPIRIT WITH WHICH YOU'RE MAKING THIS PROPOSAL, BUT RELEASING THESE SPACES FROM 6:00 A.M. TO 5:00 P.M., WHICH IS A GOOD ARRANGEMENT, WE, YOU KNOW, MAKE A BIT OF MONEY FOR PARKS AND WRECK, WHICH IS WHERE THIS MONEY ACCRUES TO, BUT ALSO THE PARKING IS AVAILABLE FOR PARK USE IN THE EVENINGS AND WEEKENDS, SO IT'S NOT -- THIS AMENDMENT WOULDN'T AFFECT JUST THE UNIVERSITY FOLKS BUT ALSO PRESUMABLY THE OTHERS WHO ARE GOING TO BE USING THESE 18 -- THE PARK USERS, IN THE EVENINGS AND ON WEEKENDS. SO I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT WOULD PLAY OUT, AND I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S SOMEONE HERE FROM PARKS AND REC? MR. LANIFELD? IS THAT -- THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE YOUR BEING HERE.
00:50:09.840: >> MY PLEASURE. YES, I WOULD AGREE THAT THE UNIVERSITY USES THESE SPOTS FOR ABOUT 33% OF THE WEEK, FROM 6:00 A.M. TO 5:00 P.M., AND THE REST OF THE TIME IS FOR PARK USERS. IN REGARDS TO MAKING IT LOW EMISSIONS VEHICLES ONLY, THAT WOULD LIMIT THE PARK USERS' ABILITY FOR THOSE 18 SPOTS, AND WHEN THERE'S ONLY 18 SPOTS AT RIVERSIDE, IT WOULD BE HARD TO MAKE THEM ALL LOW EMISSIONS, BUT I WOULD AGREE WITH COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN THAT WE'D PROBABLY WANT TO TALK WITH THE UNIVERSITY AS WELL BEFORE WE -- IF THIS WAS APPROVED BY COUNCIL.
00:50:45.442: >> THANK YOU, MR. LANDERFEL.
00:50:52.249: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  IF I MAY, TWO THINGS.
00:50:54.451: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  HOLD ON. I HAVE GOT A QUEUE HERE. COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
00:50:58.255: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRAND:  THANK YOU. SO PART OF THE REASON WHY I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER IS BRINGING THIS FORWARD RIGHT NOW IS PARTLY PROCESS ISSUE. HE SITS ON THE PARK ADVISORY COMMISSION AND HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO BRING THIS UP WHEN IT WAS RECOMMENDED TO COUNCIL, SO I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED ABOUT THE TIMELINE. ALSO, IT'S JUST THAT WE -- THIS IS A PRENEGOTIATED CONTRACT, WHICH MY UNDERSTANDING OF THAT IS THAT IT GOES BOTH WAYS BETWEEN THE CITY AND THE UNIVERSITY. SO I DON'T THINK THAT IT'S ACTUALLY -- IF WE WANT TO SEND IT BACK TO PARKS, I'M NOT IN FAVOR OF THAT. I THINK THIS IS A REALLY FAVORABLE ARRANGEMENT. IT IS A HIGHLY-USED PARK. IT'S USED FOR THINGS LIKE RECREATIONAL FIELD GAMES, WHERE PEOPLE DO COME FROM DIFFERENT PLACES, AND I THINK IT IS REALISTIC THAT WE HAVE PARKING FOR THOSE USERS. IT'S ADJACENT TO A PATH THAT TAKES YOU TO ONE OF OUR, YOU KNOW, MOST HIGHLY USED AMENITIES IN THE CITY, WHICH IS THE ARGO CASCADES AND THE ARGO LIVERY, SO THERE ARE REAL REASONS WHY WE WANT PARKS USERS TO BE ABLE TO COME AND PARK AT THIS SPOT. I DON'T THINK I WOULD ACTUALLY BE IN FAVOR OF GETTING RID OF ALL OF THESE 18 SPACES AND HOPE THAT EVERYONE WOULD BIKE OR WALK TO THAT SITE, BECAUSE BEING ABLE TO DRIVE AND PARK HERE ENABLES PEOPLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO A REALLY, YOU KNOW, IMPORTANT NONMOTORIZED ASSET WHERE THEY CAN RECREATE IN OUR COMMUNITY, AND SO TO BE ABLE TO GET SOME MONEY AND TO BE ABLE TO LEVERAGE THE FACT THAT THE UNIVERSITY USES THIS FOR GOLD PASSES, WE CAN ACTUALLY GET MORE MONEY FROM THEM. I WOULD ASSUME THAT IF WE WERE GOING TO BE ASKING FOR, YOU KNOW, ELECTRIC VEHICLES THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO MAKE REALLY SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN OUR INFRASTRUCTURE, BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE ARE COMMUTING IN AND USING THESE SPACES, AND I THINK IT'S A SAFE ASSUMPTION THAT THEY WOULD WANT TO CHARGE THOSE FOLKS IF THEY WERE PAYING, YOU KNOW, A COUPLE OF THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR FOR A PARKING PASS TO PARK THERE. SO I WON'T BE SUPPORTING THE AMENDMENT. I APPRECIATE WHERE IT COMES FROM, BUT I THINK THIS -- THIS JUST MISSES THE PARK.
00:53:05.282: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
00:53:06.150: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  YEAH, THANK YOU. FIRST OFF, READ MY SIMPLE WHEREAS AND RESOLVED CLOSE, I MAKE NO MENTION OF REQUIRING E.V. INFRASTRUCTURE. I'M SIMPLY SAYING I'M TIRED OF HAVING A CAR COME DOWN TO THE AREA WHEN WE ARE IN A CLIMATE EMERGENCY. IT'S TERRIBLE FOR THE AIR AND FOR OUR CARBON COUNTING. ALSO, I DID NOT SUGGEST IN ANY WAY THAT WE GET RID OF THESE SPOTS, NOR THAT WE REQUIRE CITY USERS TO HAVE LOW EMISSION VEHICLES ONLY. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT POSTING A SIGN THAT SAYS ZERO EMISSION OR LOW EMISSION VEHICLE. IF WE DON'T, WHAT WAS THE POINT OF DECLARING A CLIMATE EMERGENCY? EVERYTHING THAT WE DO ON COUNCIL HAS TO BE SEEN THROUGH THE LENS OF THE EMERGENCY THAT WE DECLARED. IF WE DON'T, WE ARE GOING BACKWARDS. SO IT'S JUST A MATTER OF HOW IS IT POSTED. THERE'S A STRAWMAN, E.V. INFRASTRUCTURE. IT'S A STRAWMAN THAT I WANT TO GET RID OF THE SPACES. THOSE SPACES ARE THERE. I WANT THEM TO BE USED PROPERLY AND CONSISTENT WITH OUR DECLARATION OF A CLIMATE EMERGENCY. THAT'S ALL.
00:54:12.883: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION. PERHAPS WE CAN MOVE THIS LONG, COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
00:54:15.819: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. MR. HAYNER, IF WE MISINTERPRETED, I APOLOGIZE. THE LANGUAGE IS SHALL BE RESERVED, WHICH IS THE FIRMEST LANGUAGE CAN BE. THAT "SHALL BE" IMPLIES MUST BE.
00:54:36.940: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  FOR UNIVERSITY USERS. THIS IS REFERRING TO THE UNIVERSITY --
00:54:40.677: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN:  IT'S NOT, THOUGH. IT'S NOT IN THE LANGUAGE.
00:54:44.014: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
00:54:46.016: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  AND JUST TO REITERATE, THESE 18 PARKING SPACES, TWO THIRDS OF THE TIME, THEY ARE USED BY JOHN Q. PUBLIC, JANE AND JOHN Q. PUBLIC, WHO WERE THERE TO ACCESS OUR PARKS.
00:55:02.065: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  SURE. I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE CITY. I'M TALKING ABOUT THE UNIVERSITY.
00:55:08.405: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  THIS SAYS 18 SPACES SHALL BE RESERVED FOR ZERO EMISSIONS VEHICLES.
00:55:12.543: >> IN OUR LEASE LANGUAGE, WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, NOT WITH RESIDENTIAL USERS.
00:55:18.916: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  BUT AS PROPOSED, IT DOESN'T SPECIFY THAT.
00:55:25.055: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  MR. POSTEMA, CAN YOU RESOLVE THIS ISSUE?
00:55:34.164: >> CITY ATTY. POSTEMA:  ON THE GRAMMAR OF IT?
00:55:38.936: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  DOES THIS RESOLVED CLAUSE RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE LEASE, OR IF PASSED, WOULD IT ALTER THE USE OF THESE SPACES IN TOTAL FOR CITY USERS AS WELL?
00:55:51.949: >> CITY ATTY. POSTEMA:  I WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT IT. I'M SORRY. I DON'T HAVE IT IN FRONT OF ME.
00:55:57.921: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER NELSON IN THE MEANTIME.
00:56:00.924: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  I APOLOGIZE, BUT I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS JUST BECAUSE OF THE LOGISTICS THAT I KNOW FROM HAVING DRIVEN A HYBRID VEHICLE AND HOW MANY MILES I HAD ON A SINGLE CHARGE. IF YOU DON'T -- IF YOU DON'T INVEST IN INFRASTRUCTURE AT THIS LOCATION, YOU HAVE LIMITED THE CATEGORY OF USERS THAT CAN MAKE USE OF IT, IF THEY ARE COMMUTING ANY DISTANCE AT ALL, AND SO I JUST, AS A PRACTICAL QUESTION, I DON'T -- I DON'T THINK THE UNIVERSITY WOULD EVEN HAVE ANY REASON TO RENT THESE SPACES FROM US AT ALL IF THE RESTRICTION WAS DRAFTED THIS WAY.
00:56:34.658: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER EATON?
00:56:35.526: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  THANK YOU. SO I SECONDED THIS, BUT I WON'T BE SUPPORTING THE AMENDMENT. I THINK THAT IT HAS TO -- WE HAVE TO GIVE SOME LEAD TIME TO STAFF TO NEGOTIATE THESE KIND OF TERMS. LAST FRIDAY, WE SAT -- COUNCILMEMBER GRAND AND I SAT DOWN WITH STAFF TO TALK ABOUT THE FULLER ROAD PARKING LOT LEASES, AND WE ARE LOOKING AHEAD ON THOSE, AND SO IT'S THAT -- LOOKING THAT FAR AHEAD THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING RATHER THAN AMENDING IT AFTER THE NEGOTIATIONS ARE COMPLETE. SO, I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THIS KIND OF IDEA COME UP WELL BEFORE A LEASE IS COMING FOR OUR APPROVAL, AND SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO WRITE TO STAFF AND TELL THEM YOUR CONCERNS ABOUT THE FULLER ROAD PARKING LOTS, BECAUSE THERE'S HUNDREDS OF PARKING SPACES THERE THAT WE LEASE, AND YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO MAKE MORE OF AN IMPACT ON THESE 18 SPACES IF YOU TURN YOUR ATTENTION TO THE AUGUST LEASE THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY NEGOTIATING, RATHER THAN THIS PARTICULAR ONE.
00:57:39.590: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  I HAVE GOT COUNCILMEMBER SMITH, AND THEN PERHAPS WE CAN MOVE THIS FELLOW ALONG TO A VOTE. I THINK WE ALL KIND OF KNOW WHERE EACH OF US ARE GOING, PERHAPS. COUNCILMEMBER SMITH?
00:57:47.331: >> COUNCILMEMBER SMITH:  YEAH, I'M NOT GOING TO SUPPORT THIS, BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS, BECAUSE, AS WE TALK ABOUT E.V. INFRASTRUCTURE, THIS IS AN IMPORTANT DEFICIT, AND JUST LOOKING AT THE UNIVERSITY'S RESOURCES FOR E.V. CHARGING STATIONS AND ALL OF THEIR PARKING FACILITIES, THEY HAVE A GRAND TOTAL OF 14 E.V. CHARGING SPACES, AND I THINK IT'S PROPER FOR COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER TO RAISE THIS AS AN ISSUE THAT THEY NEED TO DO MORE TO AUGMENT THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR E.V. CHARGING STATIONS IN THEIR FACILITIES. THIS DOESN'T NECESSARILY DO IT, BUT AS WE LOOK AT OTHER SITUATIONS, PARTICULARLY SURFACE PARKING LOTS WHERE THERE'S OPPORTUNITY TO ALSO DEVELOP SOLAR IN CONJUNCTION WITH E.V. CHARGING STATIONS, I THINK WE NEED TO PURSUE SOME OF THAT LANGUAGE IN SOME OF THOSE AGREEMENTS.
00:58:39.483: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE PLEASE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER. ON THE AMENDMENT.
00:58:50.293: >> CITY CLERK:  COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
00:58:52.963: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  YES.
00:58:53.597: >> CITY CLERK:  COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER?
00:58:54.931: >> COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER:  NO.
00:58:55.565: >> CITY CLERK:  COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD?
00:58:56.900: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD:  NO.
00:58:57.534: >> CITY CLERK:  COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
00:58:58.335: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  NO. GRAND?
00:58:59.936: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRAND:  NO.
00:59:00.537: >> CITY CLERK:  COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN?
00:59:01.405: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN:  YES.
00:59:02.039: >> CITY CLERK:  MAYOR TAYLOR?
00:59:04.341: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  NO. EATON?
00:59:05.008: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  NO. NELSON?
00:59:06.343: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  NO. SMITH?
00:59:07.411: >> COUNCILMEMBER SMITH:  NO.
00:59:09.079: >> CITY CLERK:  COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
00:59:09.913: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  NO.
00:59:10.981: >> CITY CLERK:  THE MOTION FAILS.
00:59:12.215: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN MOTION? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
00:59:15.485: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY YOU TALK ABOUT GETTING AHEAD OF THE CURVE ON NEGOTIATING THINGS, I WAS NOT EVEN AWARE THAT THIS LEASE WAS UP FOR RENEGOTIATION UNTIL IT SHOWED UP ON P.A.C.  IT'S ON THE AGENDA. WE DON'T GET TO VOTE ON IT AS LIAISONS. WE ARE EX OFFICIO ON P.A.C. SO MY COLLEAGUES CONCERNS ABOUT WHY DIDN'T I BRING THIS UP AT THE MEETING, SOMETIMES YOU DON'T THINK ABOUT THINGS UNTIL YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THEM, YOU GO HOME, AND -- WHAT'S A GOOD RESOLUTION? SO THAT'S WHERE MY ATTEMPTED MODIFICATIONS CAME FROM. I HAVE A HARD TIME SUPPORTING THIS. I KNOW THE PARK NEEDS THE MONEY, AND I KNOW EVERYBODY IS GOING TO SAY YES TO IT, BUT IT'S NOT THE RIGHT THING. IT'S LIKE OUR PIMPING OUR PARKS OUT, TO BE FRANK. I DON'T THINK WE ARE GETTING ENOUGH FOR IT, ESPECIALLY NOW WHERE I DON'T THINK IT'S AN APPROPRIATE USE. COUNCILMEMBERS SMITH AND RAMLAWI? OH, MY APOLOGIES.
01:00:22.219: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  THANK YOU. I HAD WRITTEN DOWN IN MY NOTES TO TALK ABOUT THE MAIN MOTION WITH THE ELECTRIC CHARGING STATIONS, AND THAT WAS DEFINITELY AN ISSUE THAT I HAD WITH THIS. THIS AGREEMENT DIDN'T ADDRESS THAT, AND I THOUGHT THAT THAT SHOULD BE, AGAIN, EMBEDDED IN ALL OF OUR NEGOTIATIONS GOING FORWARD, AND PERHAPS WE ARE A LITTLE LATE EMBEDDING IT IN THIS ONE. FURTHERMORE, I THINK WE HAVE WOEFULLY UNDERSOLD OURSELVES FINANCIALLY. I APPRECIATE COUNCILMEMBER LUMM'S QUESTIONS EVERY MEETING. IF SHE EVER LEAVES COUNCIL, I HOPE SHE JUST SENDS QUESTIONS IN, AND, YOU KNOW, THIS STAFF'S RESPONSE TO THAT IS THIS IS 33% OF THE WEEK, AND, YOU KNOW, I'M DOING THE MATH HERE, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, THERE IS NO CHARGE FOR PARKING ON SUNDAYS, PARK IS CLOSED FROM 10:00 P.M. TO 6:00 A.M., SO WE ARE NOT JUST GIVING THESE SPACES OUT FOR 33% OF THE DAY. IN FACT, IT'S WELL OVER 50% OF THE TIME, IF YOU REALLY LOOK AT THE ECONOMIC SENSE IN THE USE OF THESE SPACES. SO, UNFORTUNATELY, I KNOW THE UNIVERSITY IS A VERY IMPORTANT PARTNER WITH THE CITY AND THE CITY WITH THEM. I CANNOT SUPPORT THIS AMENDMENT -- OR THIS LEASE, THAT IS. I CANNOT SUPPORT IT AT THIS DOLLAR FIGURE, WITH THE UNIVERSITY CHARGING CLOSE TO $1,900 FOR A PERMIT AND GIVING THE CITY A FRACTION OF IT. I FIND IT A BAD BUSINESS DEAL. THEREFORE, I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS LEASE WITH THESE FINANCIAL TERMS.
01:02:14.731: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
01:02:18.435: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRAND:  I JUST WANT TO THANK PARKS STAFF FOR THE THOROUGH JOB THAT YOU DID WORKING WITH THE UNIVERSITY AND EXPLAINING HOW YOU CAME UP WITH THESE NUMBERS. THIS IS A SMALL LEASE RELATIVE TO SOME OF THE LARGER LEASES THAT WE HAVE, AND I THINK WE ARE DEFINITELY GETTING AHEAD OF THE NUMBERS ON THAT ONE. YOU KNOW, IT'S AN ASSET THAT WE ALREADY HAVE. IT'S A WAY TO LEVERAGE SOME MONEY. I REALLY DO TAKE OFFENSE AT THE -- I'M NOT EVEN GOING TO REPEAT WHAT COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER SAID -- ABOUT WHAT WE ARE DOING TO OUR PARKS. I THINK THAT'S PROBLEMATIC, TO SAY -- TO USE THAT TO CHARACTERIZE STAFF'S EFFORTS FOR WHAT REALLY HAS BEEN LIKE A -- FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, A CREATIVE USE OF AN ASSET THAT WE ALREADY HAVE IN A WAY TO BE GOOD PARTNERS AND BRING SOME REVENUE INTO A SYSTEM. I THINK IT ALSO PROBABLY CAPTURES A WAY THAT IF WE DIDN'T HAVE -- IF WE DIDN'T HAVE THIS AGREEMENT, THAT THERE MIGHT BE EMPLOYEES PARKING THERE ANYWAY, SO IT IS A WAY TO ACTUALLY CAPTURE THAT REVENUE AND HAVE SOME STRONGER REGULATIONS AND HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING AND COMMUNICATIONS WITH THOSE EMPLOYEES BETWEEN THE PARKS AND THE UNIVERSITY ABOUT WHEN EMPLOYEES CAN BE PARKING THERE AND WHEN THEY NEED TO LEAVE, AND I THINK THESE RELATIONSHIPS HAVE BEEN REALLY HELPFUL IN ENSURING THAT THOSE SPACES ARE OPEN FOR OUR PARK'S USERS WHEN THERE'S THE GREATEST NEED. SO I'M REALLY APPRECIATIVE OF STAFF'S EFFORTS. THIS WAS VETTED BY THE PARK ADVISORY COMMISSION, AND LIKE COUNCILMEMBER EATON SAID, I ENJOYED THAT CONVERSATION THAT WE HAD LAST WEEK. I THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY THOROUGH, AND PARKS STAFF HAVE A REALLY GREAT PRESENTATION IF ANYONE IS INTERESTED IN SEEING WHAT WE ARE THINKING ABOUT FOR FULLER PARK COMING UP.
01:04:10.413: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
01:04:13.450: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS JUST MADE BY COUNCILMEMBERS RAMLAWI AND GRAND, AND I WILL ALSO JUST NOTE THAT STAFF IN THEIR RESPONSE, THANK YOU VERY MUCH, SHARED THAT, YOU KNOW, PROVIDED THE RATIONALE FOR THESE RATES, WHICH I AGREE ARE REASONABLE, AND IT WAS BASED ON WHAT THE U OF M GOLD PERMIT IS, COST PER YEAR, AND IT WAS DIVIDED BY A THIRD, BECAUSE THEY ARE GOING TO BE USING THIS A THIRD OF THE TIME, ESSENTIALLY, SO THIS CHARGE OF $739 PER SPACE OR A LITTLE OVER 13,000, SORRY, A YEAR TOTAL WITH A 3% BUILT-IN INCREASE FOR YEAR TWO I THINK IS A GOOD ARRANGEMENT, AND SO, AGAIN, AND A REASONABLE RATE TO CHARGE, AND IT'S NICE TO SEE THAT THIS REVENUE ACCRUES TO PARKS IN THE PARKS AND REC GENERAL FUND. SO, YEAH, I APPRECIATE YOUR WORK ON THIS AS WELL, AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING IT. THANKS.
01:05:20.150: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  I TOO AM GOING TO BE SUPPORTING THE RESOLUTION. THE CITY AND THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN WORK CLOSELY AND WELL TOGETHER ON A WIDE VARIETY OF MATTERS. THIS IS AN INSTANCE IN WHICH WE CAN HELP THEM WITH SOME OF O OUR -- WE CAN HELP THEM, RATHER, WITH THEIR PARKING NEEDS IN AN IMPORTANT AREA OF THE COMMUNITY, AND WE CAN OBTAIN A MEASURE OF REVENUE FOR OUR PARKS AT LITTLE OUTLAY TO -- AT LITTLE COST TO OURSELVES. IT IS A WIN-WIN. IT IS WHAT -- THIS IS AN EXAMPLE, I THINK, OF WHAT PARTNERS DO WITH EACH OTHER, AND I'M PLEASED TO SUPPORT IT. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
01:06:04.227: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  THANK YOU. YOU KNOW, AGAIN, I WON'T BE SUPPORTING THIS. I BELIEVE IT'S A BAD BUSINESS DEAL. I APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT'S BEEN PUT INTO IT BY STAFF TO GET US TO THIS POINT. I WOULD JUST SAY I ASK MY COLLEAGUES TO JOIN ME IN ASKING STAFF TO GO BACK AND RENEGOTIATE A BETTER DEAL TO GET US MORE MONEY FOR OUR PARKS. AS WE KNOW, THEY ARE UNDERFUNDED, SO EVERY DOLLAR MATTERS. WE ARE INDUCING PARKING HERE, INDUCING TRANSPORTATION, INDUCING CARS COMING INTO THIS PART OF THE CITY THAT'S GOT A LOT OF TRAFFIC TO BEGIN WITH. SO, I JUST THINK WE ARE INCONSISTENT WITH THE MESSAGE AND THE POLICY THAT WE ARE SETTING. AGAIN, WE DECLARED A CLIMATE EMERGENCY, AND BUT WE ARE NOT FOLLOWING UP WITH THE INCREMENTAL ORGANIC MEASURES THAT NEED TO TAKE PLACE IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS. I APPRECIATE AGAIN THAT THE -- THE THOUGHT AND THE SPIRIT. THIS IS SOMETHING I BELIEVE CAN BE FIXED WITH RENEGOTIATING, GOING BACK AND NEGOTIATING WITH OUR PARTNERS TO GET IT RIGHT, COME BACK WITH US, MAYBE A COUPLE OF CHARGING STATIONS IN LIEU OF THE ADDITIONAL, YOU KNOW, FINANCIAL OUTLAY, SOMETHING MORE THAN IS CURRENTLY BEING OFFERED. I THINK WE ARE UNDERSELLING OURSELVES IN THIS CASE ON MANY LEVELS, AND I DON'T THINK IT'S TOO MUCH TO GO BACK AND ASK FOR A BETTER DEAL, SOMETHING THAT'S MORE MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL.
01:07:46.496: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  LET ME SUGGEST THAT WE ARE DONE ON THIS, BUT IF THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT WANT MORE TO SAY, COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER AND THEN HAYNER.
01:07:54.170: >> COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER: YES. I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS OF COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI AND HAYNER, AND I DO THINK U OF M NEEDS TO BE MORE -- OR I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THEM ENCOURAGED BY CITY STAFF AND CITY COUNCIL TO MOVE MORE QUICKLY ON ENCOURAGING THEIR EMPLOYEES TO PARK AND RIDE AND ZIP INTO TOWN ON POSSIBLY AN ELECTRIC BUS, AND ALSO BUILD MORE WORKFORCE HOUSING ON THEIR 2000 ACRES OF LAND HERE. SO, ONE THING THAT WAS DISCUSSED LAST NIGHT AT CAUCUS WAS THE WHEREAS CLAUSE, WHERE THIS WAS FOR A TWO-YEAR LEASE AGREEMENT WITH AN OPTION TO RENEW FOR ANOTHER SUCCESSIVE TWO-YEAR TERM, TAKING US THROUGH 2024. THERE WAS SOME ENCOURAGING WORDS AT CAUCUS LAST NIGHT THAT WE COULD MAKE AN AMENDMENT TO BRING THAT DOWN TO ONE YEAR, A ONE-YEAR LEASE FOR TODAY, AND SO -- AND THEN REVISIT IT AGAIN MORE QUICKLY. SO I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE THAT AMENDMENT TO THE WHEREAS CLAUSE, THAT THE TERM OF THE AGREEMENT SHALL BE ONE YEAR.
01:09:13.182: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  ONE TWO-YEAR TERM, OR ONE YEAR?
01:09:16.919: >> COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER:  A ONE-YEAR TERM.
01:09:20.990: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  I WOULD SECOND THAT.
01:09:23.393: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI. COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER, YOU STILL HAVE THE FLOOR.
01:09:27.230: >> COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER: THAT WAS FOR ALL OF THE REASONS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED. THAT'S WHERE THIS AMENDMENT IS COMING FROM.
01:09:34.671: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
01:09:40.043: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  I THINK WE NEED AN ANSWER FROM MR. POSTEMA ABOUT HOW THAT WOULD WORK, BECAUSE THE LEASE AS IT IS PRESENTED IS TWO YEARS WITH SORT OF INCREASING RATES ON THE SECOND YEAR, SO --
01:09:54.357: >> CITY ATTY. POSTEMA:  WE HAVE ALREADY ADOPTED A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME, BUT YOU'RE ASKING ON THE RENEWAL TO HAVE IT FOR ONE YEAR. WE HAVEN'T GONE INTO THE NEXT YEAR, SO THE ONE-YEAR PERIOD IS, I BELIEVE, FOR THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR?
01:10:19.182: >> CITY ADMIN. LAZARUS:  IT'S WHATEVER THE CONTRACT TERMS ARE. THIS IS A BILATERAL AGREEMENT. ANY CHANGES THAT WE MAKE, WE HAVE TO GO BACK TO U OF M TO HAVE THEM AGREE AS WELL, IF IT'S THE PLEASURE OF COUNCIL WITH A PROVISO THAT WE LOOK AT -- IT TAKES A LOT OF NEGOTIATING TIME FROM STAFF, AND MAYBE THE BETTER ANSWER IS TO ENCOURAGE US TO GO TALK TO U OF M TO LOOK AT PARKING AS A WHOLE.
01:10:56.619: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER NELSON, I THINK YOU STILL HAVE THE FLOOR.
01:10:59.822: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  I'M DONE.
01:11:00.656: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  SO, I GUESS ALTERING A WHEREAS CLAUSE DOES NOT ALTER THE UNDERLYING, IF IT'S COUNCIL'S DESIRE TO HAVE THIS PARTICULAR LEASE BE RENEGOTIATED, LET ME I GUESS SUGGEST THAT WE POSTPONE IT, THAT THERE BE A MOTION TO POSTPONE, WHICH I WOULD VOTE AGAINST, BUT IF THAT'S THE DESIRE, THE METHOD, I THINK, THAT MAKES SENSE IS TO HAVE THERE BE A MOTION TO POSTPONE, WHICH THEN GETS VOTED ON. DURING THE COURSE OF THAT POSTPONEMENT, WE WOULD HAVE STAFF TALK TO THE UNIVERSITY ABOUT ALTERING THE TERM, CONSISTENT WITH THE YES VOTES, AND WE'D MOVE FORWARD ON THAT BASIS. SO, IN THAT LIGHT, CAN I ASK FOR THIS AMENDMENT TO THE WHEREAS CLAUSE BE WITHDRAWN?
01:11:46.502: >> YES.
01:11:47.170: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU. DOES ANYBODY HAVE AN OBJECTION TO THAT? SO NOW WE HAVE DISCUSSION ON THE MAIN MOTION. I GUESS COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER YOU STILL HAVE THE FLOOR.
01:11:53.776: >> COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER: OKAY. WELL, I WOULD LIKE TO OFFER THEN THAT WE POSTPONE THIS RESOLUTION AND GO BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD TO INCORPORATE SOME OF THE DISCUSSION WE HAVE HAD TONIGHT, INCLUDING A ONE-YEAR TERM AND SOME OF THE OTHER LANGUAGE ABOUT ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND PARK AND RIDE AND A HIGHER PIECE OF THE RENT COMING TO THE CITY.
01:12:23.506: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  HOW LONG IS NECESSARY TO HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS?
01:12:32.381: >> I WOULD ASSUME AT LEAST A COUPLE OF MONTHS, WORKING WITH THEM DURING THAT TIME, AT LEAST A MONTH TO TWO MONTHS IF NOT LONGER. SORRY. I DON'T DO THE NORMAL OF IT.
01:12:40.656: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THAT'S ALL RIGHT. SO THIS IS THE FIRST MEETING. DO YOU WANT TO SAY THE SECOND MEETING IN APRIL?
01:12:48.631: >> IT EXPIRES ON MARCH 31ST, IS WHEN THE CURRENT LEASE --
01:12:55.004: >> CITY ADMIN. LAZARUS:  I THINK IT'S REASONABLE TO ASK US TO COME BACK WITH A CONTRACT OR AN UPDATE.
01:13:07.016: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  IS THAT ALL RIGHT, COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER? DISCUSSION OF THE POSTPONEMENT, COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER, YOU STILL HAVE THE FLOOR, AND LET'S MOVE THIS ONE QUICKLY, PLEASE.
01:13:16.425: >> COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER:  I'M ALL SET.
01:13:17.393: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
01:13:18.494: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  SO THIS IS A TWO-YEAR LEASE AGREEMENT FOR 18 PARKING SPACES. WE ARE POSTPONING THIS? WE ARE PROPOSING -- YEAH, IT'S LIKE MIND BLOWING. I'M SORRY, IT REALLY IS. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 18 PARKING SPACES, 13,000 TO THE PARKS DEPARTMENT, YEAR ONE, IT'S REAL MONEY, AND IT GROWS BY 3%. SO, POSTPONING IT UNTIL WHEN?
01:13:44.921: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  SECOND MEETING IN MARCH.
01:13:47.356: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  AND THAT WILL GET THE JOB DONE? WE'LL SEE.
01:13:51.661: >> IF I CAN SPEAK, IF WE COULD POTENTIALLY DO -- IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT SOME WAY TO MAKE AN AMENDMENT, IF YOU COULD DO THE TWO YEARS WITHOUT THE SECONDARY RENEWAL, THAT WAY WE WOULD BE IN THAT CONTRACT, AND THEN AS WE WORKED WITH U OF M --
01:14:04.941: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  BUT WHY? IF I CAN ASK, JUST KNOW YOU HAVE 3% BUILT IN FOR YEAR TWO.
01:14:12.782: >> IT'S A TWO-YEAR AGREEMENT, AND THEN WITH THE RENEWAL, SO THAT WOULD BE -- IF THERE'S ANYTHING, IF WE CAN GET THE TWO-YEAR AGREEMENT, THAT WOULD BE GREAT. I THINK STAFF WILL DO WHAT COUNCIL WOULD LIKE.
01:14:30.433: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD, HAYNER. COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD? ON THE POSTPONEMENT. LET'S KEEP IT QUICK, PLEASE.
01:14:39.075: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD:  I THINK THAT WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED BY STAFF IS A GOOD COMPROMISE, AND I ALSO HAVE ONE QUESTION FOR STAFF:  THE FULLER ROAD PARKING, ARE THOSE ONE-YEAR OR TWO-YEAR CONTRACTS?
01:14:51.253: >> HISTORICALLY, IT'S BEEN A ONE-YEAR LEASE WITH AN OPTION TO RENEWAL ADMINISTRATIVELY, SO THAT IS WHAT THE LAST EIGHT YEARS HAVE BEEN. IT'S BEEN ONE-YEAR LEASE WITH A RENEWAL.
01:15:04.000: >> OKAY. THANK YOU.
01:15:06.202: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
01:15:07.069: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I AGREE WITH YOUR EFFORT AT COMPROMISE, SIR. I THINK VOTING ON A TWO-YEAR LEASE IS APPROPRIATE. I MEAN, WHETHER I SUPPORT IT OR NOT, WITHOUT THE ADMINISTRATIVE CLAUSE TO RENEW IT, BECAUSE THEN AT LEAST WE HAVE [ OFF MIC ] OURSELVES IN A FUTURE A TWO-YEAR CONVERSATION TO BE HAD AGAIN, AND WE HAVE TWO YEARS TO THINK ABOUT WHAT'S NEEDED FOR THOSE SPACES. IF YOU LIVE IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD THAT I REPRESENT, IT'S NOT REALLY LIKE A PARTNERSHIP, BECAUSE IN A MONTH, THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE 1482 SPACES OPERATING BETWEEN THOSE TWO STRUCTURES, AND ANOTHER 18 IS -- IN THE OCEAN. I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE DON'T DELAY THIS AND THAT WE VOTE UP OR DOWN ON A TWO-YEAR PLAN. I MEAN, IT'S NOT MINE TO MODIFY, BUT I ALREADY SAID MY THING ABOUT IT.
01:15:59.789: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE POSTPONEMENT?
01:16:02.525: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  I APPRECIATE YOUR OFFER.
01:16:04.060: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE POSTPONEMENT?
01:16:08.264: >> I WOULD LIKE TO WITHDRAW MY POSTPONEMENT FOR THE OTHER AMENDMENT, AS DISCUSSED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD AND HAYNER.
01:16:20.576: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  WE CAN'T AMEND THE CONTRACT ON THE FLOOR. ALL WE CAN DO IS POSTPONE IT. FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE POSTPONEMENT? COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
01:16:36.292: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  I'M SORRY. I THINK COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER IS TRYING TO WITHDRAW HER POSTPONEMENT. SHE CANNOT WITHDRAW HER POSTPONEMENT AND OFFER ANOTHER AMENDMENT? IS THAT WHAT YOU JUST TOLD HER?
01:16:48.170: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  BECAUSE IT'S AN NEGOTIATED CONTRACT, WE CAN'T AMEND THE CONTRACT. WE CAN HAVE IT POSTPONED.
01:16:53.976: >> OKAY.
01:16:54.977: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  AND THEN WITH INSTRUCTION TO ALTER IT.
01:16:58.080: >> OKAY, OKAY.
01:16:59.548: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  BUT WE DON'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO AMEND THE UNDERLYING CONTRACT EFFECTIVELY.
01:17:02.485: >> I FOLLOW YOU. IT'S THE FRAMING OF HER AMENDMENT, I GUESS IS WHAT -- YEAH. OKAY.
01:17:10.292: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER?
01:17:12.361: >> COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER:  SO ARE YOU SAYING -- ARE WE SAYING THAT WE CAN POSTPONE IT AND TAKE OUT THIS RENEWAL FOR ANOTHER TWO-YEAR TERM? BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S AGREEMENT THAT WE WOULD GO WITH THE EXISTING LEASE, AS SUGGESTED BY STAFF, FOR TWO YEARS. WE JUST WOULD LIKE TO REMOVE THE SECOND HALF OF THAT WHEREAS CLAUSE ABOUT HAVING AN AUTOMATIC RENEWAL FOR ANOTHER TWO YEARS.
01:17:35.684: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  I BELIEVE STAFF IS GOING TO TAKE THAT AS ITS INSTRUCTION AS IT GOES BACK TO RENEGOTIATE THE CONTRACT WITH THE UNIVERSITY IN THE EVENT THAT THE POSTPONEMENT PASSES. AM I CORRECT?
01:17:48.931: >> YES. .
01:17:56.972: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING WITH THE POSTPONEMENT, STARTING WITH -- UNLESS SOMEONE HAS SOMETHING TO SAY. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
01:18:05.948: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  DOES THE CLERK CALL IT OR YOU, MR. MAYOR?
01:18:10.019: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  I DON'T CALL IT.
01:18:12.721: >> I'M JUST WAITING FOR JACKIE. HAYNER?
01:18:20.162: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:
01:18:22.298: >> COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER: YES.
01:18:23.666: >> CITY CLERK:  COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD?
01:18:24.533: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD:  YES. LUMM?
01:18:26.535: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM: GRAND?
01:18:28.170: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRAND:
01:18:28.804: >> CITY CLERK:  COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN?
01:18:29.672: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN:  NO. MAYOR TAYLOR.
01:18:30.639: >> MAYOR TAYLOR: EATON?
01:18:31.240: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON: NELSON?
01:18:32.341: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON: SMITH?
01:18:33.108: >> COUNCILMEMBER SMITH:  NO.
01:18:34.343: >> CITY CLERK:  COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
01:18:35.177: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  YES.
01:18:35.811: >> CITY CLERK:  THE MOTION FAILS.
01:18:37.413: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN MOTION? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, ON THE MAIN MOTION, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
01:18:45.855: >> CITY CLERK:  COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
01:18:48.924: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  NO.
01:18:49.725: >> CITY CLERK:  COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER?
01:18:50.593: >> COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER: YES. GRISWOLD?
01:18:53.295: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD:  YES.
01:18:53.929: >> CITY CLERK:  COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
01:18:55.231: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  YES. GRAND?
01:18:56.031: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRAND:  YES.
01:18:56.932: >> CITY CLERK:  COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN?
01:18:57.800: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN:  YES.
01:18:58.467: >> CITY CLERK:  MAYOR TAYLOR?
01:18:59.068: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  YES. EATON?
01:18:59.768: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  YES. NELSON?
01:19:01.003: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  YES.
01:19:01.637: >> CITY CLERK:  COUNCILMEMBER SMITH?
01:19:02.438: >> COUNCILMEMBER SMITH:  NO.
01:19:03.038: >> CITY CLERK:  COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
01:19:04.940: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  NO.
01:19:06.775: >> CITY CLERK:  THE MOTION CARRIES.
01:19:08.043: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  CA9, RESOLUTION TO RESTATE THE PURPOSE OF THE ANN ARBOR ENERGY COMMISSION. DISCUSSION, PLEASE, OF CA9, COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
01:19:18.787: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  JUST BRIEFLY, THIS IS SIMILAR TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION, WHERE WE WANT TO ADD YOUTH MEMBERS TO THE ENERGY COMMISSION, WHICH I FULLY SUPPORT. HOWEVER, I'M NOT CERTAIN IF THIS IS LINED CORRECTLY IN THE AGENDA, BUT IT SAYS 14-25 IS THE DEFINITION OF A YOUTH MEMBER. I KNOW WE HAD A GO-ROUND AT THE LAST MEETING OF IS 14 TOO YOUNG, SHOULD IT BE 16, IS 25 TOO OLD FOR YOUTH. SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE COMMENTS THAT I BELIEVE 14 IS TOO YOUNG AND 25 IS TOO OLD. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE NUMBER IS TO AMEND IT. PERHAPS MY COLLEAGUE COUNCILMEMBER EATON WOULD HAVE A NUMBER. I THINK 14 IS TOO YOUNG. IT'S JUST MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH MY 14-YEAR-OLDS.
01:19:59.328: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
01:20:01.297: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE MY KIDS WERE 14, BUT I TEND TO AGREE, AND SO I WOULD MOVE TO AMEND THIS IN PARAGRAPH 1(B), WHERE IT CURRENTLY SAYS THE AGES OF 14 AND 25, AND CHANGE THAT TO 16 AND 25.
01:20:19.782: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER. IS THAT FRIENDLY TO THE BODY?
01:20:23.252: >> YES.
01:20:23.619: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  NOT FRIENDLY? COUNCILMEMBER EATON, YOU STILL HAVE THE FLOOR.
01:20:27.189: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  WE HAD THIS DISCUSSION A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO ON THE OTHER COMMISSION. IT PASSED. I'M NOT GOING TO FLOG THIS HORSE.
01:20:34.997: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
01:20:36.865: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRAND:  I WON'T FLOG IT EITHER, BUT I DO HAVE A 14-YEAR-OLD AT HOME, AND I GET EXPOSED TO A LOT OF 14-YEAR-OLDS, AND THROUGH MOVEMENTS RELATED TO CLIMATE ACTION IN THE CITY HAVE ENCOUNTERED A LOT OF 14 AND 15-YEAR-OLDS WHO KNOW A LOT MORE ABOUT THESE ISSUES THAN MOST ADULTS THAT I RUN INTO. SO I THINK THEIR APPLICATIONS SHOULD BE ABLE TO STAND ON THEIR OWN MERITS. I UNDERSTAND THIS IS GOING DOWN, BUT JUST HAVING A LOT OF PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH YOUNG PEOPLE THAT AGE, I FEEL LIKE IF THEY WANT TO COME OUT AND CONTRIBUTE TO THEIR COMMUNITY, AND I HOPE THAT WE WILL MAKE EFFORTS ON OTHER COMMISSIONS TO INCLUDE YOUTH MEMBERS AS WELL. I HOPE THESE AREN'T THE FIRST -- YOU KNOW, THE LAST TWO WHERE WE MAKE THIS CHANGE, BECAUSE I THINK IT'S REALLY ENCOURAGING TO TRY TO ENCOURAGE YOUNG PEOPLE TO GET INVOLVED IN THEIR BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS AND START PARTICIPATING IN CIVIC LIFE EARLY. SO I'LL BE VOTING NO, UNDERSTANDING THAT --
01:21:40.529: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? I'M SORRY. MY APOLOGIES, COUNCILMEMBER GRAND. FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
01:21:52.908: >> ON THE AMENDMENT?
01:21:53.509: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU. THIS IS ON THE AMENDMENT FROM 14 TO 16. HAYNER?

01:24:15.117: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  JUST I WANT TO THANK MR. CRAWFORD AND THE FOLKS AT WATER FOR PUTTING THIS TOGETHER. I WAS SURPRISED, AND MAYBE SOME OF YOU WERE TOO, TO SEE THE AMOUNT OF ROLLING BONDS THAT WE HAVE OUT THERE, AND IT'S A -- YOU KNOW, IT'S A LOT. IT'S AN ONGOING PROCESS, AND SO IT WAS JUST -- YOU KNOW, IT WAS JUST SORT OF -- IT SHOWS THE LONG-TERM COMMITMENT THAT WE HAVE TO OUR WATER SYSTEM HERE IN THE CITY, AND I JUST -- PEOPLE AREN'T DRINKING DIRTY WATER. THEY ARE NOT GOING TO DRINK DIRTY WATER. WE CAN -- WE ARE DOING THE BEST THAT WE CAN HERE, AND THIS IS A BIG A PART OF THAT. I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO SUPPORT THIS BOND ISSUANCE.
01:24:54.456: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
01:24:56.491: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  I WOULD JUST SAY THE BONDS ARE OF COURSE SECURED BY THE REVENUES, PAID FOR BY THE UTILITY PAYERS, AND THE WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM, THESE ARE NOT GENERAL OBLIGATION BONDS TO THE CITY, AND I APPRECIATE THE FEEDBACK ABOUT THE RATES, THAT BY ISSUING -- AND THIS IS THE SEVENTH TIME WE HAVE ISSUED THEM THROUGH THE DRINKING WATER REVOLVING FUND, AND THEY ARE SOLD TO THE MICHIGAN FINANCE AUTHORITY THROUGH THIS PROGRAM, AND THAT THE RATES ARE LOWER, AND THE FINANCIAL ADVISORS INDICATED THAT THE RATES COULD BE HALF A PERCENT LOWER IF THE CITY ISSUED THE REVENUE BONDS, SO WELL DONE, FINANCE DEPARTMENT.

01:26:09.298: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  DC1 BEING SHIFTED, WE COME TO DC2, RESOLUTION TO APPOINT ERIC ELLIS TO THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE.
01:26:16.938: >> YOU MISSED ONE.
01:26:19.641: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  I DID, INDEED. MY EARNEST APOLOGIES. C2, AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND SECTION 1:171 OF CHAPTER 8 (ORGANIZATION OF BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS) OF THE CODE OF THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER NELSON, SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER EATON. PLEASE, PLEASE, OF C2, COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
01:26:38.460: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. SO, THIS IS -- THIS IS AN AMENDMENT -- THIS IS SORT OF JUST CREATING A STANDARD PROCEDURE FOR HOW APPLICANTS TO BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS ARE CONSIDERED, AT LEAST IN CASES WHERE A BOARD OR COMMISSION HAS A COUNCIL LIAISON, AND I GOT THE IDEA FOR THIS FROM MY WORK ON THE COMMISSION ON DISABILITIES ISSUES, BECAUSE ON THAT BODY, WE HAVE A DESIGNATED COMMISSIONER WHO IS IN CHARGE OF RECRUITMENT AND MEMBERSHIP, AND HE HAD PREVIOUSLY -- FOR THE LAST YEAR, HE'S COORDINATED, SINCE I HAVE BEEN ON THE COMMISSION, FOR THE LAST YEAR, HE'S COORDINATED WITH THE MAYOR'S OFFICE AROUND APPLICANTS AND FILLING OPENINGS, AND WE JUST DECIDED ON OUR COMMISSION THAT IT ACTUALLY WOULD BE A LOT MORE EFFICIENT IF OUR MEMBERSHIP PERSON COORDINATED WITH ME, BECAUSE I, AS A COUNCILMEMBER, I HAVE ACCESS TO THE DATABASE OF APPLICATIONS, SO I LOOKED AT SOME BYLAWS FOR OTHER BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS, AND THERE ARE DIFFERENT PROCEDURES FOR HOW APPLICANTS ARE CONSIDERED, AND IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT IT WOULD PROBABLY BE A REALLY GOOD IMPROVEMENT TO THE PROCESS IF EVERY BOARD AND COMMISSION, WITH THE BENEFIT OF A COUNCIL LIAISON WHO HAS ACCESS TO THIS DATABASE, COORDINATED WITH ANOTHER COMMISSIONER AND BASICALLY HAD A REGULAR REVIEW OF APPLICANTS SO THERE COULD BE A CONVERSATION ABOUT -- FROM PEOPLE SITTING ON THE BODY, WHAT SKILLS AND EXPERIENCES DO WE NEED TO CONTRIBUTE TO OUR WORK, AND SO I HOPE THIS ISN'T TERRIBLY CONTROVERSIAL. IT DOES NOT DIMINISH IN ANY WAY THE AUTHORITY OF ANYONE PROCEDURALLY TO CHOOSE WHOEVER THEY WANT AS A NOMINEE, AND I'M SPEAKING OF THE MAYOR, OF COURSE. THE MAYOR CAN CHOOSE WHOEVER HE WOULD LIKE TO NOMINATE TO POSITIONS. HOWEVER, I'M -- THIS SORT OF ADDS AN EXTRA CONVERSATION WHERE BOARD MEMBERS AND COUNCIL LIAISONS TO BOARDS COULD MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE MAYOR AND SEE, YOU KNOW, THESE ARE SOME APPLICANTS THAT WE THINK YOU SHOULD GIVE AN EXTRA LOOK TO. SO THAT'S MY SUMMARY, AND I HOPE YOU'LL SUPPORT MY AMENDMENT. THANK YOU.
01:28:50.559: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:28:52.194: >> WHERE IS -- I DON'T SEE --
01:28:53.128: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  THANK YOU, AND THANK YOU TO MY COLLEAGUE WHO BROUGHT THIS FORTH IN ORDER TO HAVE MORE BEST PRACTICES USED AS WE TRY TO GOVERN. IN THIS CASE, THIS IS A FIRST READING, SO I WILL SUPPORT IT, BUT I JUST -- I'M JUST CURIOUS AS TO HOW MUCH INFLUENCE THE MEMBER OF THE COUNCIL IS GOING TO HAVE ON WHO IS ON THESE BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS. I APPRECIATE KNOWING WHO IS COMING IN AND WHO IS LEAVING AND WHO THE APPLICANTS ARE, AND I KNOW THAT WE HAVE ACCESS TO IT, BUT THERE ARE SO MANY BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS, AND TIME FLIES, SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT IT'S GOOD TO HAVE A GROUP DESIGNATED TO HELP WITH THAT, AND WE'LL TALK MORE OFFLINE BETWEEN NOW AND THE NEXT MEETING ABOUT HOW THIS WILL HELP ADDRESS IT, BUT I JUST WANTED THESE BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS TO OPERATE IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T HAVE UNDUE INFLUENCE, AND I UNDERSTAND THERE'S GOING TO BE A RUB THERE, AND IT'S OBVIOUS IN SOME BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS THAT IT EXISTS TODAY, BETWEEN POLICY MAKERS AND PEOPLE ON BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS WHO WANT TO SHAPE POLICY AS WELL. SO, I'LL JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT. I APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU.
01:30:23.385: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER EATON?
01:30:24.386: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  I WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A COSPONSOR FOR THIS. THANK YOU.
01:30:29.824: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
01:30:30.692: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER: THANKS. A QUESTION AND A COMMENT. THE QUESTION IS IN ADDITION TO 1B, WHERE IT SAYS THE GROUP DESIGNATED UNDER SECTION NAMED SHALL SUBMIT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR APPOINTMENTS. SO, SHALL? LIKE, THEY ARE? THAT'S HOW EVERY BOARD AND COMMISSION THAT HAS A COUNCIL LIAISON IS GOING TO CREATE THIS SMALL GROUP TO REVIEW THESE, AND THEN MUST -- SHALL OR MUST, RIGHT? THAT'S WHAT SHALL MEANS, SO I'M JUST -- THAT'S MY QUESTION. IS THAT WHAT THAT MEANS THERE? SO LIKE -- SO ANNE AND CHIP ARE ON ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION, AND SO THEY ARE GOING TO GET THEIR GROUP TOGETHER FROM E.C. OR THE MAYOR AND JULIE AND I OR WHOEVER, SHALL SUBMIT? THAT'S MY QUESTION. AND THE COMMENT IS I THINK IT IS A GOOD IDEA TO GET A FORMAL PROCESS IN THERE AND THIS DOES HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BENEFIT THE BOARDS AND ALSO THE SELECTION PROCESS AND GET MORE PEOPLE LOOKING AT WHOSE NAMES THOSE ARE AND PERHAPS ASSIST THE MAYOR IN CHOOSING, BUT IT ALSO HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CREATE A -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE RIGHT WORD IS. THIS ISN'T GOING TO SOUND RIGHT MAYBE, BUT SORT OF A SYSTEM WHERE THERE'S UNDUE AUTHORITY GIVEN TO COUNCIL LIAISONS TO COMMISSIONS TO MAKE THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT CREATE A KIND OF AN INBRED SYSTEM. INBRED ISN'T THE RIGHT WORD, BUT A SYSTEM WHERE THERE MIGHT BE TOO MUCH AUTHORITY GIVEN OVER THE SELECTION. I MEAN, I KNOW IT ONLY RESTS WITH THE MAYOR NOW, BUT IT JUST -- SOMETHING -- I'M JUST CONCERNED. I JUST HAVE GENERAL CONCERNS ABOUT IT, VAGUE CONCERNS. THANK YOU.
01:32:20.602: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER GRAND -- I'M SORRY, COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER. MY APOLOGIES. COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
01:32:26.007: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRAND:  THANK YOU. I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE WHERE THIS IS COMING FROM. I LIKED THE SYSTEM AND THINK IT IS AN EXCELLENT IDEA TO HAVE, MORE ACCESS TO THOSE APPLICATIONS. BUT I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS AS IT IS BECAUSE I DO FEEL LIKE IT IS OVERLY RIGID IN TERMS OF DESIGNATING HOW THE PROCESS GOES. IN VARIOUS COMMISSIONS THAT I HAVE SAT ON AND HAVING SAT ON A COMMISSION, I THINK THE PROCESS CAN VARY. FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN I APPOINT MEMBERS TO THE GREENBELT, WE ALSO -- WE INVOLVE LEADERSHIP, MYSELF, AND THE STAFF LIAISON, AND THERE'S NO MENTION OF THE STAFF PERSON THAT HELPS IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT CANDIDATES, BECAUSE I THINK SOMETIMES THEY HAVE A GREAT UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE NEEDS ARE,SO I DO LIKE THE IDEA OF HAVING A PROCESS. I ALSO AM CONCERNED ABOUT IF THE MAYOR WERE TO GO FORWARD WITH ANOTHER MEMBER THAT WASN'T RECOMMENDED THAT THAT WOULD CAUSE JUST UNNECESSARY CONFLICT AND TOXICITY INTO THE PROCESS THAT IF THE MAYOR DECIDED TO GO AGAINST THAT RECOMMENDATION, THAT WE ARE JUST DRAGGING POTENTIALLY AGAIN PEOPLE'S NAMES WHO ARE TRYING TO VOLUNTEER THROUGH THE MUD PUBLICLY AT THIS TABLE, AND I WOULD LIKE TO AVOID THAT. SO I DO LIKE THE IDEA OF HAVING A PROCESS WHERE WE HAVE ACCESS TO THIS DATA. THERE IS NO REASON WHY WE CAN'T SHARE IT WITH THE DESIGNATED PERSON ON THE COMMISSION OR THE LEADERSHIP OF THAT COMMISSION, BUT I -- I DON'T LIKE THE STEP OF MAKING THIS SO FORMALIZED THAT IT HAS TO BE THE SAME WAY, BECAUSE I THINK COMMISSIONS OPERATE DIFFERENTLY, AND I'M JUST A LITTLE NERVOUS ABOUT DICTATING THIS PROCESS TO A COMMISSION.
01:34:12.914: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD?
01:34:16.918: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD:  I WOULD LIKE TO BE LISTED AS A COSPONSOR. THIS IS FIRST READING. I THINK THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES POSSIBLY FOR IMPROVEMENT. I THINK THAT FORMALIZING PROCESSES WHILE STILL PROVIDING SOME AGILITY IS A GOOD IDEA, AND SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE BALANCE IS THERE, BUT I HOPE THAT COUNCILMEMBER NELSON WILL LOOK AT THAT. THANK YOU.
01:34:42.076: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
01:34:42.977: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  I WONDER IF SOME OF THESE CONCERNS, NOW IN GIVING IT A MOMENT'S THOUGHT, COULD BE MODIFIED TO ADD PARAGRAPH A IN THERE, AND/OR STAFF LIAISON, AND MODIFYING PARAGRAPH B TO SAY MAY SUBMIT. JUST MY OPEN-ENDED SUGGESTIONS, THAT WE COULD SAY -- I AGREE WITH WHAT COUNCILMEMBER GRAND SAID, THAT SOMETIMES THE STAFF LIAISONS ARE IN A GREAT POSITION TO REALLY SAY, HEY, HERE'S THE NEED THAT WE HAVE. LIKE, REALLY, KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN FOR THIS KIND OF PERSON. LET'S SIT DOWN AND REVIEW THESE FOR A PERSON THAT FITS THIS BILL. I AGREE THAT STAFF SOMETIMES HAS A REALLY GOOD IDEA. LIAISONS HAVE BEEN VERY HELPFUL. I KNOW THAT IT HAS BEEN WITH THE CENTER CITY TASK FORCE. SHE HAS BEEN REALLY TERRIFIC, SO I DON'T KNOW IF THAT -- I'M NOT A SPONSOR OF THIS, BUT THAT'S MY SUGGESTION, THAT WE MODIFY IT IN THAT WAY.
01:35:34.229: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER NELSON?
01:35:35.129: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  SO YOUR SUGGESTION IS TO ADD A CLAUSE IN A AND/OR CITY STAFF MEMBERS?
01:35:45.607: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  WHERE IT SAYS AND/OR ONE OR MORE VOTING MEMBERS OF THE BOARD COMMISSION AND/OR STAFF LIAISON TO THE BOARD.
01:35:52.080: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  STAFF LIAISON?
01:35:53.047: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  I AM NOT SURE.
01:35:53.948: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON: BECAUSE I WOULD BE OPEN TO THAT. SO, A COUPLE OF THINGS. I GUESS MY APPOINTMENTS ARE SOMEWHAT UNCONVENTIONAL. I HAVE THE MOST -- THE MOST CONVENTIONAL APPOINTMENT THAT I HAVE AS A COUNCIL LIAISON IS THE COMMISSION ON DISABILITIES, AND AS IT'S FUNCTIONING NOW, IT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD FOR LARRY AND I MEET TO JUST ONCE A MONTH AND SIT DOWN, AND LIKE IF ANYBODY ELSE WERE TO WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT APPLICATIONS ARE OUT THERE FLOATING. SO I DON'T -- BUT THE CHALLENGE OF LOGISTICS, MAYBE IT'S MY -- IT'S THAT MY -- I DON'T HAVE THE KIND OF CONVENTIONAL APPOINTMENTS THAT OTHERS HAVE IN ENVIRONMENTAL OR ENERGY OR ONES WITH LOTS OF VOLUNTEERS. ANYWAY, I GUESS I'M ALSO LIKE REALLY INTRIGUED BY THE IDEA THAT IT IS MORE PROBLEMATIC TO INCLUDE MORE PEOPLE, AND A FEW OF US ARE MORE COMFORTABLE HAVING THIS ALL REST IN THE HANDS OF ONE PERSON, BECAUSE I ALWAYS FEEL BETTER ABOUT A DECISION THAT INCLUDES A COUPLE MORE HEADS RATHER THAN JUST ONE. SO -- AND I GUESS MY OTHER IDEA WAS THAT, TRULY, THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE BEST POSITION TO KNOW WHAT'S NEEDED ON A BOARD OR COMMISSION ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SITTING ON IT. BUT I WOULD TAKE AS A FRIENDLY AMENDMENT ADDING THE PHRASE AND/OR STAFF LIAISONS OR STAFF MEMBERS, IF ANYBODY HAS A PROPOSED PHRASING FOR THAT, BECAUSE I APPRECIATE THAT STAFF IS SUPPORTING THESE BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS, AND THEY ALSO ARE IN A POSITION TO KNOW. I WOULD -- FOR THE B, PERHAPS WE COULD SAY MAY INSTEAD OF SHALL. AGAIN, THIS IS WHERE I AM LOOKING TO MY OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE ON THE DISABILITY COMMISSION. IT'S NOT -- IT'S NOT BURDENSOME FOR US TO LOOK THROUGH A LIST OF APPLICANTS, AND WHEN I LOOK THROUGH THE GRANT DATABASE, IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE TO ME THAT THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF APPLICATIONS THAT ARE THIS UNWIELDY TASK FOR A COUPLE OF PEOPLE TO SIFT THROUGH, BUT I GUESS I'M LISTENING TO OTHERS' SUGGESTIONS, FROM OTHERS.
01:38:01.943: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FOLLOWING UP ON THAT, I THINK I HAVE SOME LANGUAGE WHICH MIGHT FIT THE TWO INTERESTS. IN A, WHEN ONE OR MORE COUNCILMEMBERS ARE APPOINTED AS MEMBERS OF THE LIAISONS TO A BOARD AND COMMISSION, THE BOARD OR COMMISSION SHALL DESIGNATE A GROUP CONSISTING OF RELEVANT STAFF, THE COUNCIL, THE CITY COUNCILMEMBERS, AND ONE OR MORE MEMBERS.
01:38:27.402: >> UH-HUH.
01:38:28.703: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  IS THAT ACCEPTABLE?
01:38:29.537: >> THAT'S FRIENDLY.
01:38:32.907: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  MOVED BY ACKERMAN AND SECOND BY NELSON. IS THAT FRIENDLY TO THE BODY?
01:38:38.679: >> NO.
01:38:39.647: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  ALL RIGHT. LET'S HOLD OFF, IF I MAY.
01:38:42.650: >> WE SHOULD DO THEN ONE AT A TIME.
01:38:47.121: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN:  IT HAS ALREADY BEEN MOVED.
01:38:49.357: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  IT HAS ALREADY -- EXACTLY, YOU'RE RIGHT. WELL, THE NEW LANGUAGE IS ADDING RELEVANT STAFF, AND IT HAS BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED, AND THERE IS AN OBJECTION TO IT, SO IT WAS NOT FRIENDLY, AND SO LET'S ROLL WITH THAT AMENDMENT. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
01:39:04.639: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  IF I COULD SPEAK TO THE AMENDMENT?
01:39:06.941: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  PLEASE.
01:39:07.475: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  SO MY CONCERN HERE -- AND THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER NELSON, FOR PRESENTING THESE RECOMMENDATIONS, AND GENERALLY, THEY ARE FINE, AND I CAN SEE HOW FROM YOUR EXPERIENCE ON THE DISABILITY COMMITTEE, YOUR BEING INVOLVED WITH RECOMMENDATIONS AND BEING AWARE OF APPLICANTS TO THAT BOARD OR COMMISSION AND THEN PASSING ALONG THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS HAS BEEN VERY HELPFUL WITH SOME OTHER BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS AS WELL. I KNOW THE WAY THE POLICE COMMISSION IS SET UP, WE HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY NOW, SET UP FORMALLY. YOU KNOW, IT'S ESTABLISHED IN THE ORDINANCE TO PROVIDE THAT GUIDANCE. MY CONCERN AND WHY I SAID I OBJECT TO AMENDING IT IN A FRIENDLY MANNER, SORRY, RESIDES WITH, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO STAFF, JUST HISTORICALLY, APPOINTMENTS TO BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS HAS BEEN GOVERNED BY CHARTER, AND THE MAYOR, YOU KNOW, IS THE GREATER AMONG US AND HAS ALWAYS HAD THIS AUTHORITY. IT'S ESTABLISHED IN THE CHARTER AS WELL, AND I DO NOT THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO -- YOU KNOW, WE CAN ALWAYS SEEK THE ADVICE OF STAFF MEMBERS, BUT WHEN IT COMES TO MAKING APPOINTMENTS, I DO NOT THINK THAT SHOULD BE SOMETHING THAT IS -- WHERE A STAFF PERSON -- AGAIN, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO OUR STAFF, WHERE A STAFF PERSON IS GIVEN THAT AUTHORITY. I DO THINK THAT SHOULD RESIDE -- CONTINUE TO RESIDE WITH THE ELECTED OFFICIALS. AGAIN, WE CAN BE ADVISED BY STAFF, BUT I DO NOT THINK THAT THEY, YOU KNOW, SHOULD BE HAVING THIS MUCH AUTHORITY ON APPOINTMENTS TO OUR BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS. I REALLY THINK IT SHOULD BE MORE OF A CITIZEN-DRIVEN, ELECTED-OFFICIAL RECOMMENDATION, IF YOU WILL, THE WAY IT ALWAYS HAS BEEN, SO I'M NOT COMFORTABLE INCLUDING -- THE PRECISE LANGUAGE AGAIN, MR. MAYOR, WAS?
01:41:32.920: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  CONSISTING OF RELEVANT STAFF, CITY COUNCILMEMBERS --
01:41:45.266: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  IT'S GIVING THE AUTHORITY TO STAFF. AGAIN, I SAY THAT RESPECTFULLY.
01:41:49.737: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN?
01:41:51.005: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN:  THAT MADE ME REDO MY MENTAL MATH IN CONSIDERATION OF THIS, BUT I THINK I WILL STILL SUPPORT IT. I THINK WE ALL HAVE BLIND SPOTS. I THINK WE AS GROUPS OF PEOPLE HAVE EVEN MORE BLIND SPOTS, AND I THINK IF STAFF'S ROLE IS TO BE AN OBJECTIVE PERSON IN THE ROOM, THEY CAN BE A VALUABLE ASSET IN POINTING OUT WHAT DEFICITS OF EXPERTISE THE COMMISSION OR BOARD MAY HAVE. I THINK THEY CAN BE REALLY VALUABLE. I THINK TOO WHILE THE LANGUAGE DOESN'T SPECIFY THIS, IT WOULD BE MY EXPECTATION THAT IT WOULD BE ONE MEMBER OF STAFF. A MINORITY OF THE GROUP WOULD BE STAFF, AND THEIR VOICE WOULDN'T OVERWHELM THIS PROCESS, AND I THINK WITH THAT, I WOULD BE COMFORTED TO KNOW THAT THEY WOULD BE A VOICE IN THE ROOM BUT NOT THE LARGEST VOICE IN THE ROOM.
01:42:33.180: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
01:42:35.549: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  YEAH, I APPRECIATE COUNCILMEMBER LUMM'S THOUGHTS ON THIS, DEEP THOUGHTS REGARDING OUR BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS AND HOW THIS SHOULD RESIDE WITH ELECTED MEMBERS, WITH THE POLITICAL BODY RATHER THAN STAFF, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO STAFF. THIS IS THE ONE PART WHERE OUR COMMUNITY CAN INTERJECT THEIR POLITICAL WILL AND CHALLENGE THE INSTITUTIONAL WAY OF DOING BUSINESS, AND SO, YOU KNOW, I PAUSE. YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU START MAKING THAT, IT BECOMES A SEISMIC FUNDAMENTAL SHIFT IN HOW YOU COMPOSE THESE BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS WOULD ULTIMATELY SHAPE POLICY. SO I DO THINK YOU'RE MIXING OIL AND WATER IN SOME RESPECTS.
01:43:42.683: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, AND THEN PERHAPS WE CAN --
01:43:44.251: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  YEAH, I KNOW I WAS THE ONE WHO BROUGHT IT UP, BUT I'M FINDING MYSELF AGREEING WITH WHAT COUNCILMEMBERS LUMM AND RAMLAWI HAVE SAID, AND I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS A QUESTION FOR OUR ATTORNEY, BUT ARE THERE CHARTER -- IS THERE ANYTHING IN THE CHARTER THAT PRECLUDES THIS KIND OF CONVERSATION THAT WE ARE EVEN HAVING RIGHT NOW? YOU WOULD SPEAK UP, I WOULD ASSUME.
01:44:05.873: >> CITY ATTY. POSTEMA:  I'LL LOOK FURTHER. OFFHAND, I DO NOT SEE ANYTHING ON THAT. ULTIMATELY, THE CHARTER DOES GIVE THE APPOINTMENT AUTHORITY SPECIFICALLY TO THE MAYOR, BUT THIS ORDINANCE, AS WE HAVE ADVISED COUNCILMEMBER NELSON, THERE IS NOT A CHARTER PROBLEM WITH THE -- WITH GIVING THIS DIRECTION.
01:44:26.861: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  OKAY. WELL, THANK YOU FOR CLARIFYING THAT, AND COUNCILWOMAN LUMM SPEAKS FROM EXPERIENCE AND AS MAYOR PRO TEM, AND I THINK SHE'S RIGHT, THIS IS A PROCESS THAT IS RESERVED FOR THE POLITICAL BODY. IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT -- JUST ANOTHER THING THAT WE ARE LAYING ON STAFF FOR. I SPOKE HIGHLY OF OUR STAFF, AND I DON'T TAKE THAT BACK, BUT I THINK I'M NOT GOING TO SUPPORT THIS AMENDMENT. I THINK THAT -- I THINK MY COLLEAGUES ARE RIGHT ON THIS ONE, THAT THIS IS NOT THE WAY TO GO. IT'S PEOPLE'S PROCESS. NOT THAT STAFF AREN'T PEOPLE, JUST LIKE NOT THAT COUNCILMEMBERS AREN'T MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. COUNCILMEMBERS ARE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC.
01:45:12.807: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FOR WHATEVER IT'S WORTH, I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THE AMENDMENT. I THINK THIS IS AN ADVISORY -- THIS ORDINANCE SEEKS TO EFFECT AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE. STAFF PERFORMS ADVISORY FUNCTIONS ALL THE TIME. THEY HAVE VALUABLE INFORMATION AND EXPERTISE WITH RESPECT TO THE VARIOUS BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS. FURTHER, I WOULD EXPECT ANY -- I WOULD EXPECT STAFF NOT TO DOMINATE THOSE CONVERSATIONS. IT'S MY, YOU KNOW, FIRM BELIEF THAT THEY WOULD PARTICIPATE AND PROVIDE ADVICE TO THE COUNCILMEMBER AND THE RELEVANT MEMBERS OF THE BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS AND THEN MOVE FORWARD. FINALLY, EVEN IF THIS DOESN'T PASS, I GUESS I WOULD EXPECT THE CHAIR AND THE COUNCILMEMBER TO CONSULT WITH THE STAFF MEMBER, BECAUSE THE STAFF MEMBER KNOWS A THING OR TWO ABOUT THE COMMISSION AND THE SUBJECT MATTER RELATED. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
01:46:08.996: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  I WOULD JUST SAY THIS WOULD BE A LEAP BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, I THINK IT'S A BIT OF A LEAP TO OPEN THIS UP TO HAVING COUNCILMEMBERS -- IN FACT EVEN MAKE THESE KINDS OF RECOMMENDATIONS, BUT THIS WILL LEAD TO, YOU KNOW, ENGAGING PEOPLE IN A POSITIVE WAY AND PRODUCTIVE WAY. BUT I -- IT'S WHY DO I SAY IT'S A BIT OF A LEAP, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, AS WE KNOW, AGAIN, IN THE CHARTER, IF YOU LOOK AT THE DUTIES OF THE MAYOR, THE MAYOR IN DESCRIPTION IN CHAPTER 4 OF THE CHARTER, THE MAYOR APPOINTS ALL MEMBERS OF COMMITTEES AS A MEMBER THEREOF AND MAKES OTHER APPOINTMENTS IN THE CHARTER OR BY THE COUNCIL, AND, AGAIN, THE AUTHORITY HAS ALWAYS, AT THE END OF THE, RESIDED WITH THE MAYOR, AND AGAIN, HE'S THE GREATER AMONG US. THE -- WHOEVER SITS IN THAT SEAT IS, SO THAT GOES ALONG WITH THAT JOB DESCRIPTION, AND RIGHTFULLY SO, IN MY VIEW. THE -- BUT TO -- THIS WOULD BE A DRAMATIC, OR AS COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI SAID, A SEISMIC SHIFT, AND EVEN THOUGH THIS -- WHOEVER, YOU KNOW, IS IN THE ROOM, WHEN THESE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE MADE ON THE STAFF SIDE, WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE IN THE MINORITY, IT STILL IS -- YOU KNOW, AGAIN, I THINK IT'S ALWAYS HELPFUL TO SEEK THAT INPUT. HOWEVER, TO HAVE THE STAFF PERSON AS THIS NOW READS ACTUALLY MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS ON WHO SHOULD BE APPOINTED TO A BOARD AND COMMISSION IS REALLY A SEISMIC CHANGE, AND SO I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING IT.
01:48:04.011: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER EATON, AND THEN PERHAPS WE CAN MOVE FORWARD ON THE AMENDMENT.
01:48:07.381: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  SO I HAVE FOUND THE ARGUMENTS OF COUNCILMEMBERS LUMM AND RAMLAWI PERSUASIVE, AND I'LL BE VOTING AGAINST THIS. THANK YOU.
01:48:16.256: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE ON THE AMENDMENT STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER. HAYNER?
01:48:21.662: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER: BANNISTER?
01:48:22.997: >> COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER: GRISWOLD?

01:48:35.943: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  NO.
01:48:36.577: >> CITY CLERK:  THE MOTION FAILS.
01:48:37.411: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THE SECOND, I GUESS, CONTEMPLATED OR AT LEAST SUGGESTED AMENDMENT WAS TO CHANGE SHALL TO MAY.
01:48:44.351: >> SO MOVED.
01:48:46.420: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN, SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER EATON. IS THAT FRIENDLY TO THE BODY?
01:48:48.922: >> YES.
01:48:52.526: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
01:48:55.195: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  I APPRECIATE THE ACRIMONY ON THIS, BUT I THINK IT TAKES THE TEETH OUT AND THIS BECOMES MOOT. SHALL IS PRETTY DIRECTIVE, AND MAY IS OPTIONAL, AND I THINK IT REALLY -- THAT'S JUST SOMETHING TO THINK OF.
01:49:14.948: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
01:49:16.450: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  IT DOES SEEM SLIGHTLY OUT OF SYNCH WITH A. WE ARE SAYING FORM THIS BOARD, BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING BUT WITH IT, SO MAYBE THEY SHOULD BOTH BE MAY OR BOTH BE SHALL. I WONDER IF OUR CHIEF OF -- I DON'T KNOW, I DON'T KNOW. I JUST THINK THAT, AS YOU SAID, COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, IT'S SHALL FORM THE BOARD, MAY SAY SOMETHING TO THE MAYOR, IT DOESN'T QUITE JIVE, EVEN THOUGH I SUGGESTED IT.
01:49:44.178: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  I HAVE GOT ACKERMAN, GRAND AND NELSON ON THE QUEUE.
01:49:49.450: >> DID YOU WANT TO RESPOND TO SOMETHING?
01:49:54.121: >> YOU KNOW, I DID. I AM TRYING TO BE AGREEABLE TO THIS, BECAUSE I'M OPEN TO COMPROMISE USUALLY, BUT TRULY THE WHOLE REASON I BROUGHT THIS FORWARD IS I WAS LOOKING AT COMMISSION BYLAWS, AND THERE WAS SUCH VARIATION THAT I DID SEE THE VALUE IN HAVING THIS BE THE PROCESS IN EVERY CASE. THE TRUTH IS THAT SHALL DOES MAKE A LOT MORE SENSE IN TERMS OF THE INTENT OF WHY I BROUGHT THIS FORWARD, SO I -- YEAH, IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE FOR THE -- FOR PEOPLE TO GET TOGETHER AND LOOK AT APPLICATIONS AND NOT ACTUALLY DO ANYTHING WITH IT. SO, I WOULDN'T SUPPORT CHANGING IT TO MAY.
01:50:31.058: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION?
01:50:35.763: >> WE ARE VOTING ON MAY?
01:50:36.897: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  WE ARE VOTING ON SHALL TO MAY. FOR MY PART, I'M GOING TO VOTE IN FAVOR OF MAY. I AND MY PREDECESSORS AND I ASSUME MY SUCCESSORS, YOU KNOW, REALLY DO VALUE ALL OF THE INPUT THAT WE GET. YOU KNOW, IT'S A BIG CITY, AND WE DON'T -- YOU KNOW, WE, MEANING MYSELF AND MY PREDECESSORS AND ACCESSORs DO NOT KNOW EVERYBODY, NOR DO WE KNOW WHAT THE EXIGENCIES OF ALL OF THE VARIOUS BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS ARE. AT THE SAME TIME, I DON'T WANT IT TO BE A VIOLATION OF LAW TO FAIL TO PROVIDE A RECOMMENDATION. SO THAT'S WHY I'M RECOMMENDING -- THAT'S WHY I'M GOING TO VOTE IN FAVOR OF MAY BUT ALSO VOTE IN FAVOR OF THE THING AS A WHOLE. FURTHER DISCUSSION, COUNCILMEMBER GRAND?
01:51:23.410: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRAND:  I WOULD JUST LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT SOME OF THESE APPOINTMENTS ARE TIME SENSITIVE, AND THERE ARE ACTUALLY RESTRICTIONS IN THE BYLAWS ABOUT GETTING PEOPLE REAPPOINTED WITHIN A CERTAIN TIMELINE, OR BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS CAN BE LEFT WITHOUT ENOUGH MEMBERS TO HAVE A QUORUM AND FUNCTION EFFECTIVELY. THAT CAN BE A PARTICULAR CHALLENGE AROUND TIMES OF -- LIKE SUMMERTIME, FOR EXAMPLE, SO I COULD ALSO SEE THIS BEING, IF IT WAS SHALL AND HAVING THAT PROCESS SLOW THINGS DOWN, I JUST WANTED TO MENTION THAT, BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER COMPLICATION OR UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE THAT WASN'T BROUGHT UP.
01:51:58.612: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE ON THE AMENDMENT, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
01:52:04.985: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?

01:52:40.888: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR, AND I JUST WANTED TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR AND TO THE NOW SPONSORS. I THINK THIS IS A GOOD FRAMEWORK TO PUT IN PLACE THAT SHOULD BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS WANT TO BE INVOLVED WITH THE NOMINATION PROCESS, THEY KNOW HOW TO, AND THAT'S FANTASTIC. SO, THANK YOU.
01:52:58.538: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  I'LL SAY THAT I WILL CERTAINLY BE SUPPORTING THIS. MANY, AS HAS BEEN OBSERVED, MANY BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS FOLLOW A PROCESS SIMILAR TO THIS, EITHER THE CHAIR COMMUNICATING OUT DIRECTLY TO ME OR OTHER FOLKS IN THE COMMISSION COMMUNICATING TO ME, AS INDICATED, YOU KNOW, THE PERSON SERVING AS MAYOR KNOWS ONLY A SUBSET OF FOLKS THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY, AND CERTAINLY DOESN'T KNOW THE NEEDS OF ALL OF THE VARIOUS BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS, AND SO IT'S HIGHLY USEFUL TO RECEIVE INPUT FROM A WIDE VARIETY OF SOURCES. AND, YOU KNOW, TO THE EXTENT THAT THIS GIVES BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS THE INCENTIVE TO ENCOURAGE THAT REFLECTION UPON MEMBERSHIP AND THE PROVISION OF INPUT, IT'S ALL TO THE GOOD. FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
01:53:47.087: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  YEAH, THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR FOR ARTICULATING THAT, AND I WANT TO AGREE. I THINK THIS IS ANOTHER IN A DECENT LINE OF EFFORTS TO OPEN UP THE BUSINESS OF THE CITY AND THE CITY COUNCIL TO MORE RESIDENTS, AND, YOU KNOW, ALONG WITH THESE OTHER SUNSHINE LAWS AND OTHER THINGS THAT WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT, AND I WANT TO THANK COUNCILWOMAN NELSON FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. I THINK IT IS -- YOU KNOW, I THINK ON THE WHOLE, IT'S A NICE IDEA.
01:54:13.413: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? I WILL SAY TOO, JUST ONE FINAL POINT BY WAY OF EXPERIENCE, IT'S BEEN -- IT WAS EXPRESSED THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOME CONCERN WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS OR REQUESTS FROM A SET OF BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS NOT RECEIVING -- YOU KNOW, WHOEVER IS SERVING AS MAYOR DECLINING THE RECOMMENDATION. YOU KNOW, THAT CERTAINLY HAPPENS. THE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE ALSO FOLLOWED, I THINK A LOT DEPENDS ON THE MANNER IN WHICH THAT'S DONE. THE PERSON SERVING AS MAYOR I THINK NEEDS TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE INPUT FROM THE BOARD AND COMMISSION AND NEEDS TO HONOR IT BY REFLECTION, AND FURTHER NEEDS TO HONOR IT IF AN ALTERNATE DECISION IS MADE BY ARTICULATING THE REASONS TO THE PEOPLE PROVIDING THE RECOMMENDATIONS, AS IS TYPICALLY THE CHAIR. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
01:55:07.467: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  THANKS. I'M JUST ASSUMING THAT HOWEVER THIS PROCEEDS WITH THE PROPOSAL GOING FORWARD, THERE WILL ALWAYS BE THE UNDERSTOOD FLEXIBILITY THAT IT IS THE MAYOR'S ULTIMATE CALL, AND, AGAIN, THAT IS DETERMINED BY OUR CHARTER. WHOEVER THE MAYOR IS, THAT ABILITY, THAT AUTHORITY SHOULD BE PRESERVED, UNLESS WE CHANGE THE CHARTER, AND THAT -- WE'D GO TO THE VOTERS TO CHANGE OUR CHARTER, IF THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO DO. BUT THE MAYOR, YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE THAT AUTHORITY, THAT ABILITY, AND WHETHER IT'S YOU, AND, AS YOU SAID, FOR YOUR PREDECESSORS AND SUCCESSORS, YOU KNOW, I WOULD EXPECT THE SAME AND WANT THE SAME.

01:56:39.159: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  DC2, RESOLUTION TO APPOINT ERIC ELLIS TO THE -- DID I DO THIS RIGHT? YES, I DID, TO THE GREENBELT ADVISORY COMMIT, MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRAND, SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM. DISCUSSION PLEASE OF DC2? ALL IN FAVOR? [ CHORUS OF AYES ] OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. DC3, RESOLUTION TO ESTABLISH CITY COUNCIL MOBILITY COMMITTEE
01:57:09.556: >> I HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH STAFF ON THIS, AND THEY HAVE REQUESTED THAT I MOVE TO POSTPONE THIS UNTIL THE NEXT MEETING.
01:57:15.896: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  IS THERE A SECOND? SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN. COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD, YOU STILL HAVE THE FLOOR IF YOU WISH IT.
01:57:22.769: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD:  YES. I WOULD LIKE TO READ THE MEMORANDUM THAT WAS ADDED TO THIS RESOLUTION AND ALSO PROVIDE SOME BACKGROUND. THIS RESOLUTION WAS ORIGINALLY WRITTEN ALMOST A YEAR AGO, AND I THINK THAT I CONSIDERED IT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE AS AN ELECTED OFFICIAL, BUT I DID NOT CONSIDER IT FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF OTHER PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY AND ON BOARDS AND ON COMMISSIONS, AND FOR THAT I APOLOGIZE. THE FACT THAT MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY HAVE COME OUT AND SPOKEN ABOUT MOBILITY I THINK FURTHER IS EVIDENCE THAT MOBILITY IS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE IN THIS COMMUNITY AT THIS TIME. IT WAS MY INTENT TO FORMALIZE SOME OF THE POLICY MAKING ACTIVITIES THAT COUNCILMEMBERS ARE ENGAGED IN RIGHT NOW THAT ARE NOT RECORDED AND IN SOME CASES ARE NOT FORMALLY COMMUNICATED TO STAFF MEMBERS, AND SO THIS WOULD BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO IT. THIS IS REAL SHORT. THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF THE COUNCIL MOBILITY COMMITTEE IS TO FORMALIZE AND STRENGTHEN EXISTING ACTIVITIES AND RELATIONSHIPS OF COUNCIL AND OTHER ENTITIES EXTERNAL TO THE ANN ARBOR CITY GOVERNMENT. THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION WILL CONTINUE, PER ITS CHARTER. THE COUNCIL LIAISON TO THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION WOULD SERVE ON THE COUNCIL MOBILITY COMMITTEE TO FOSTER IMPROVED COMMUNICATIONS. THE COUNCIL MOBILITY COMMITTEE WILL ALLOW FOR A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE INTERRELATIONSHIPS AND DEPENDENCIES BETWEEN THE COUNCIL GOALS OF AFFORDABILITY, SUSTAINABILITY, EQUITY, VISION ZERO, ET CETERA. AND SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET IT RIGHT AND THAT WE CONSIDER ALL OF THE PERSPECTIVES ON HOW THIS WOULD BE DONE. I SERVE ON THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION, AND I SEE THEIR WORK AS BEING WITH STAFF AND ON -- WITH POLICY SORT OF INTERNAL TO THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. I DO NOT SEE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION MEMBERS ADVOCATING IN LANSING OR SERVING ON SEMCOG TASK FORCES, EXPEDITING TICKETS WITH D.T.E. WHEN THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IN SUPPORT OF STAFF, AND SO THESE ARE REALLY TOTALLY SEPARATE FUNCTIONS, AND I AM WILLING TO CONTINUE TO FLESH OUT THOSE DIFFERENCES AND MAKE SURE THEY ARE DOCUMENTED WELL. THANK YOU.
02:00:11.838: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION BY COUNCIL OF THE POSTPONEMENT? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
02:00:20.180: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  I APPRECIATE COUNCILWOMAN GRISWOLD FOR BRINGING THIS FORTH. I WOULD JUST SUGGEST TO INCLUDE THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN IN THE FOURTH RESOLVED CLAUSE, WHEN THIS COMES BACK, AS --
02:00:33.460: >> THANK YOU.
02:00:34.794: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  -- ONE OF THE PARTNERS IN THE AREA. MOBILITY IS BECOMING A BIG ISSUE, AS WE TRY TO TACKLE ALL OF THE THINGS, WHETHER IT'S AFFORDABLE HOUSING OR CLIMATE ACTION, QUALITY OF LIFE ISSUES, AND IT SEEMS TO HAVE CAUSED A LOT OF CONSTERNATION AND FRUSTRATION WITH POLICY MAKING. I DON'T THINK THIS IS AN ATTEMPT, AT LEAST I DON'T VOTE AND SUPPORT IT IF IT'S AN ATTEMPT TO TRY TO DO SOMETHING IN A WAY OF NEGATING THE FOLKS THAT SERVE ON THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION FROM DOING WHAT THEY ARE CURRENTLY DOING, BUT I THINK THIS PERHAPS WOULD HELP US ADDRESS OUR LARGER CHALLENGES AND THE CROSS-POLLINATION THAT OCCURS IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE HAVE WITH OTHER ACTORS IN THE REGION. MOBILITY ISN'T JUST IN OUR SPHERE OF INFLUENCE HERE IN TERMS OF THE VOTERS BUT BEYOND THE BORDER AS WELL. SO I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING WHERE THIS GOES AND HEARING THE ADVICE AND CONCERNS OF STAFF AND COUNCILMEMBERS.
02:02:00.613: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE POSTPONEMENT? COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
02:02:03.516: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  THANKS, MR. MAYOR. I'LL SUPPORT THE POSTPONEMENT. I DO SUPPORT THE GIST OF THIS, AND I DON'T WANT IT TO GET LOST, BUT I DO THINK THAT THERE ARE POTENTIAL ISSUES OF OVERLAP WITH THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION AND SPECIFIC ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THIS COMMITTEE THAT NEED TO BE WORKED THROUGH. YOU KNOW, I HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT HOW THIS WOULD ALL WORK AND THE POSSIBLE EXTRA STAFF WORKLOAD THAT IT WOULD TAKE, AND THEN I'M ALSO CONCERNED THAT CREATING THIS COMMITTEE UNDERMINES THE ROLES OF INDIVIDUAL COUNCILMEMBERS IN TERMS OF COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT ON SPECIFIC WARD ISSUES. YOU KNOW, I JUST -- YOU KNOW, THE REFERENCE TO -- IN THE RESOLVED CLAUSE, THE COUNCIL MOBILITY COMMITTEE THAT WOULD IT SOUNDS LIKE TAKE THE LEAD ON COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT, AND AS WE KNOW, MOBILITY ISSUES THAT CROP UP IN OUR WARDS OR OUR NEIGHBORHOODS ARE REALLY END OF THE CURB, IF THERE EVER WAS ONE, ISSUES, AND HAS A HUGE IMPACT ON OUR CONSTITUENTS, AND EACH COUNCILMEMBER IN EACH WARD NEEDS TO HAVE -- TO BE -- TO TAKE THE LEAD ON REPRESENTING THOSE CONCERNS TO THEIR COUNCIL COLLEAGUES AND THE MAYOR, AND I JUST WOULD -- IT WOULD NOT BE HELPFUL AND NOT A POSITIVE IF WE ARE CREATING SOME COMMITTEE TO TAKE THAT LEAD ROLE IN -- YOU KNOW, BECAUSE THESE ARE -- LET'S FACE IT, THESE ARE SPECIFIC WARD ISSUES, AND SO IT'S THOSE COUNCILMEMBERS WHO NEED TO BE ENGAGED. AND I KNOW WHEN IT COMES TO THE UNIVERSITY, WE HAVE HAD, YOU KNOW, MOBILITY ISSUES CROP UP, AND WE HAVE HAD SOME RECENTLY IN THE SECOND WARD, AND OVER THE YEARS, AND WITH EVERY WARD, AND THE UNIVERSITY, YOU KNOW, IT'S BEEN MY EXPERIENCE, HAS ACTUALLY DONE A GOOD JOB OF REACHING OUT TO THE SPECIFIC AREAS AND NEIGHBORS WHO ARE IMPACTED, AND THE NEIGHBORS ARE VERY ENGAGED, AND IT'S UP TO US TO HELP TO FACILITATE THAT KIND OF ENGAGEMENT, AND, AGAIN, AND REPRESENT THEIR -- OUR NEIGHBORS' CONCERNS TO THE UNIVERSITY AND BE PRESENT IN THOSE, ALL OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS. SO, THAT'S ONE OF MY BIG CONCERNS, THAT THIS SHOULD NEVER UNDERMINE THAT ROLE THAT WE -- THAT VERY IMPORTANT ROLE THAT WE ALL HAVE, AND NEED TO, YOU KNOW, BE AN ADVOCATE AND REPRESENTATIVE OF AND FOR. BUT FOR NOW, I WILL CERTAINLY SUPPORT THE POSTPONEMENT. THANKS.
02:04:58.958: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER GRAND AND THEN SMITH.
02:05:02.528: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRAND:  I RELUCTANTLY WILL LIKELY SUPPORT POSTPONEMENT, BUT I REALLY STRUGGLE TO SEE HOW I COULD SUPPORT THIS JUST A COUPLE OF WEEKS FROM NOW, UNLESS IT WAS, I DON'T KNOW, RIPPED APART AND LIKE TOTALLY DIFFERENT WORDS WERE IN FRONT OF ME. THERE'S SO MUCH REDUNDANCY HERE IN TERMS OF THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION. WE HEARD FROM THE CHAIR. I KNOW YOU'RE NOT SPEAKING FOR THE ENTIRE COMMISSION, BUT I THINK HER POINTS WERE WELL TAKEN. WE DON'T HAVE OTHER -- I THINK THERE'S ALSO REDUNDANCIES WITH THE POLICY COMMITTEE, IF THIS IS REALLY AN ISSUE ABOUT POLICY. THERE'S NOTHING THAT SAYS THAT FIVE COUNCILMEMBERS WHO ARE INTERESTED IN ISSUES CAN'T BRING FORWARD RESOLUTIONS TO COUNCIL RELATED TO MOBILITY, SO I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY WOULDN'T JUST DO THAT, WHY WE WOULD NEED A SEPARATE COMMITTEE. I'M REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE THIRD RESOLVED CLAUSE AND THE FOURTH RESOLVED CLAUSE, THAT THIS GROUP WOULD SOMEHOW SPEAK FOR THE ENTIRE BODY ON ISSUES OF MOBILITY. I FIND THAT HIGHLY PROBLEMATIC, AS OPPOSED TO COUNCIL VOTING AS A WHOLE TO ADVOCATE FOR POLICY, AND, YOU KNOW, AND WE DON'T HAVE OTHER COMMITTEES FOR ISSUES THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO US. WE DON'T HAVE A COUNCIL CLIMATE ACTION COMMITTEE. WE DON'T HAVE A COUNCIL AFFORDABILITY -- YOU KNOW, AFFORDABLE HOUSING COMMUNITY, BECAUSE WE HAVE OTHER BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS THAT DO THOSE THINGS, AND THEN WHEN THE ISSUES ARE REALLY IMPORTANT, WE COME TOGETHER AS A BODY, AND WE WORK ON THEM. SO I FEEL LIKE THIS IS A REALLY SLIPPERY SLOPE, AND I KNOW THAT MANY OF US BELONG TO ALREADY -- YOU KNOW, WE ARE LIAISONS TO MANY, MANY BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS, SO I WOULD PERSONALLY RATHER SEE THAT ENERGY BE USED ON SPECIFIC INITIATIVES RELATED TO MOBILITY, AS OPPOSED TO JUST CREATING SOMETHING THAT I SEE AS COMPLETELY REDUNDANT.
02:07:01.180: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER SMITH?
02:07:02.014: >> ARE WE SPEAKING ON THE POSTPONEMENT?
02:07:04.617: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  PEOPLE ARE DOING WHAT THEY ARE DOING.
02:07:09.188: >> OKAY. [ LAUGHTER ].
02:07:10.723: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER SMITH.
02:07:11.591: >> COUNCILMEMBER SMITH:  LET'S GO AHEAD AND GET TO THE POSTPONEMENT, BECAUSE I'M NOT GOING TO SUPPORT EITHER.
02:07:16.896: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD?
02:07:19.332: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD:  I HAVE LISTENED TO THE COMMENTS AND WILL CONSIDER THEM. I THINK THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVEMENT, AND THAT'S ALL I'LL SAY. I FORGOT MY TRAIN OF THOUGHT WITH THE HUMOR IN THE AUDIENCE.
02:07:37.850: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE POSTPONEMENT? I WILL JUST SAY THAT I HAVE VERY SUBSTANTIAL CONCERNS WITH RESPECT TO THE RESOLUTION AND THE PROPOSAL, BUT I'LL COMMUNICATE THOSE OFFLINE.
02:07:48.895: >> EXCUSE ME. MAY I MAKE MY STATEMENT NOW?
02:07:55.601: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  YES, OF COURSE.
02:07:57.670: >> ONE OPTION WOULD BE TO ACTUALLY ROLL SOME OF THESE RESPONSIBILITIES INTO THE POLICY COMMITTEE, BECAUSE THEY REALLY ARE POLICY ISSUES BUT THAT -- I'LL GIVE SOME THOUGHT AND WORK WITH THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR ON IT TO SEE IF -- THAT WOULD REDUCE THE STAFF COMMITMENT AND MAY STREAMLINE THIS PROCESS, WHILE STILL GETTING ACCOMPLISHED WHAT WE NEED TO.

02:21:16.435: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  -- SHORT BREAK, DC4, RESOLUTION FOR CITY COUNCIL COMMUNICATIONS, MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD, SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM. DISCUSSION, PLEASE, OF DC4, COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
02:21:28.614: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD:  I MOVE TO POSTPONE THIS UNTIL THE NEXT MEETING, AND GIVEN THE OTHER IMPORTANT ISSUES WE HAVE BEFORE US TONIGHT, I WOULD PREFER THAT WE DISCUSS THIS IN COMMITTEES RATHER THAN TONIGHT. HOWEVER, I'M WILLING TO LISTEN TO ANY OF MY COUNCILMEMBERS' COMMENTS.
02:21:47.866: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  POSTPONE TO THE NEXT MEETING YOU SAY?
02:21:53.639: >> YES.
02:21:53.905: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN. ALL IN FAVOR? [ CHORUS OF AYES ] ALL OPPOSED? IT IS POSTPONED. DC5, RESOLUTION TO RECOMMEND APPROVAL AND ISSUANCE OF A DOWNTOWN LIQUOR LICENSE TO JAGGED FORK LLC MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
02:22:17.596: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  THANK YOU ALL FOR MEETING ON FRIDAY, AND THANK YOU, MS. BEAUDRY, FOR BETTING THIS ON THIS AGENDA. IT'S TO RECOMMEND THE STATE APPROVE A DOWNTOWN DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT LICENSE FOR JAGGED FORK LLC. THE STATE ABOUT 15 YEARS AGO ESTABLISHED THESE TYPES OF LIQUOR LICENSES, AND THE APPLICANT MEETS ALL OF THE CRITERIA, INCLUDING DEMONSTRATING IN EXCESS OF $75,000 OF INVESTMENT IN THE PROPERTY. CITY STAFF DOES NOT HAVE ANY OBJECTIONS. THE LIQUOR LICENSE COMMITTEE RECOMMENDS YOUR APPROVAL OF THE RESOLUTION. THANK YOU.
02:22:55.267: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? I'M SORRY. DID I MISS? MY APOLOGIES, COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
02:23:02.908: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  I JUST HAD A QUICK QUESTION, WHICH I ASKED KATHY AT CAUCUS, AND SHE DIDN'T HAVE ANY ANSWER FOR IT. WHEN I WAS READING THIS ITEM ON THE AGENDA, THERE WAS A MENTION ABOUT HAVING DEMONSTRATED $75,000 IN BUILDING IMPROVEMENTS, AND JANE, I WONDER IF YOU COULD SPEAK TO THAT OR IF ANYBODY COULD SPEAK TO THAT, WHAT WAS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF IT.
02:23:23.862: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  THAT'S A REQUIREMENT OF THESE TYPES OF LICENSES, ALTHOUGH THIS IS THE APPLICANT -- IT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO BE A TYPE C LIQUOR LICENSE THAT THIS APPLICANT WILL BE ULTIMATELY GETTING. IT'S A REQUIREMENT.
02:23:38.710: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  OKAY.
02:23:40.612: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  OF THESE LICENSES.
02:23:41.947: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  THAT PARTICULAR TYPE OF LICENSE.
02:23:43.749: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  SO IN OUR MEETINGS, STAFF FROM CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE, LIEUTENANT BUSH FROM THE POLICE DEPARTMENT, FIRE MARSHAL, BUILDING INSPECTOR, THE TREASURER, LOTS OF STAFF ARE IN THE ROOM ADVISING US, AND THE CLERK'S OFFICE -- LET'S SEE, WHO AM I MISSING, ANYONE? ALL REVIEW THESE APPLICATIONS AND HAVE TO SIGN OFF AND BE OKAY WITH THIS BEFORE WE RECOMMEND APPROVAL TO COUNCIL.
02:24:18.884: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON: THANKS.
02:24:19.651: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
02:24:20.919: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  YEAH, THANKS. BRIEFLILY, SO THESE DDA LICENSES HAVE CERTAIN STIPULATIONS, AS COUNCILMEMBER LUMM SAID, AND THERE'S NO LIMIT ON THEM, UNLIKE A CLASS C TYPE LICENSE THAT, WE CAN HAVE A LOT OF THESE, IF THEY MEET THESE REQUIREMENTS, AND ACTUALLY I'M NOT SURE HOW SUPPORTIVE I AM OF THAT, AND YET THEY EXIST, AND SO I THINK THIS ONE IS BASICALLY TAKING OVER AND EXPANDING -- THIS ONE IS TAKING OVER AND EXPANDING AN EXISTING LOWER -- A BEER AND WINE TYPE LICENSE. THEY ARE ADDING LIQUOR TO THIS, SO I THINK THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE USE OF THAT ABOVE ALL OTHERS, BECAUSE IT'S IN THE SAME LOCATION AND I THINK THAT'S FINE, AND THEY HAVE SHOWN IN THEIR OTHER LOCATIONS THAT THEY HAVEN'T HAD ANY PROBLEMS. BUT IT WAS CURIOUS TO NOTE AT THIS LATEST MEETING THAT WHEN WE LOOK AT THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF LIQUOR AVAILABILITY, LIQUOR LICENSES, EITHER A CLASS-C LICENSE, A VENDOR'S LICENSE, BEER AND WINE, WHATEVER, A TAVERN'S LICENSE, THERE'S BASICALLY ONE PLACE TO GET A DRINK FOR EVERY 500 PEOPLE IN THIS TOWN, AND I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT COMPARES TO OTHER COMMUNITIES, BUT IT WAS KIND OF A SHOCKING FIGURE. SO FOR EVERY 500 PEOPLE, THERE'S A BAR, A PARTY STORE, A RESTAURANT, WHATEVER THAT SERVES, AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S A LOT, AND IT SEEMS LIKE A LOT. I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT COMPARES TO OTHER THINGS, BUT JUST OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD, I THOUGHT, WOW, THAT'S VERY CONVENIENT.
02:25:40.665: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
02:25:43.368: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  I APPRECIATE IT. I DO ALSO SIT ON THIS COMMITTEE. THERE IS ACTUALLY A CAP ON THESE TYPE OF D.D.A. LICENSES. IT IS CLOSE TO A THOUSAND. IT'S NOT NECESSARILY UNLIMITED, BUT OVER 900, AND FROM WHAT I WAS TOLD BY MS. BEAUDRY, I THINK THE CALCULATIONS TO GET TO THAT NUMBER, THEY INCLUDED THE T.I.F. THE AMOUNT OF T.I.F. THAT'S CAPTURED, AND AMONGST OTHER THINGS, I BELIEVE, SO I JUST WANTED TO MAKE A CORRECTION. IT'S NOT UNLIMITED, BUT IT IS PRETTY DARN HIGH.
02:26:16.501: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [ CHORUS OF AYES ] OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. DC6, RESOLUTION TO RENAME THE EAST STADIUM BRIDGES LOCATED BETWEEN THE 500 AND 700-BLOCK OF EAST STADIUM BOULEVARD TO THE JOHN D. DINGELL MEMORIAL BRIDGES, MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN, SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER GRAND. DISCUSSION PLEASE OF DC6? I AM DELIGHTED TO BE A PART OF BRINGING THIS RESOLUTION FORWARD, AS FOLKS IN THE COMMUNITY KNOW. WE IN ANN ARBOR HAVE THE PLEASURE OF BEING -- AND THE HONOR OF BEING REPRESENTED BY JOHN DINGELL FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS FROM AROUND 2000 OR SO TO 2015 WHEN HE LEFT CONGRESS, AND OF COURSE SUCCEEDED ABLY AND HONORABLY AND WITH VIGOR BY REPRESENTATIVE DINGELL. JOHN DINGELL HOLDS A PLACE IN ANN ARBOR HISTORY, OF COURSE, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY IN AMERICAN HISTORY AS THE LONGEST SERVING MEMBER OF CONGRESS IN THE UNITED STATES HISTORY, WHICH IS TRULY AN INCREDIBLE THING. JOHN DINGELL SERVED THE -- HIS DISTRICT, HIS STATE AND THE NATION WITH DIGNITY AND COURAGE AND PASSION AND INTEGRITY, AND HE WAS EVERYTHING THAT YOU WOULD WANT A LEGISLATOR TO BE, AND A TRUE FRIEND TO HIS CONSTITUENTS. DURING HIS LIFE, IT WAS CONTEMPLATED HOW WE WOULD HONOR HIM AFTER HIS SERVICE, A REQUEST THAT HE ALWAYS POO-POOED, NOT INTERESTED WAS HE IN SUCH AN HONOR AS THIS. HOWEVER, HE DID HAVE A FONDNESS FOR BRIDGES. THE STADIUM BRIDGES WERE IN MANY RESPECTS THE RESULT OF HIS STRONG WORK. WE FOR YEARS WERE HAVING DIFFICULTY IN ATTAINING THE NECESSARY FUNDING TO IMPROVE THE STADIUM BRIDGES, TO REPAIR THE STADIUM BRIDGES, BUT WITH HIS ABLE AID WE WERE FINALLY ABLE TO RECEIVE A 13.9 MILLION DOLLAR GRANT FROM THE UNIVERSITY -- PARDON ME, FROM THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION -- FROM THE UNIVERSITY [ LAUGHTER ], AS IF -- FROM THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF TRANSP TRANSPORTATION, AND THE BRIDGES WERE FINALLY REPLACED. IT IS RIGHTEOUS AND FIT THAT WE HONOR MR. DINGELL BY NAMING THESE BRIDGES AFTER HIM. WE ARE COMING UPON THE ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF HIS PASSING, AND I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE THAT WE PASS THIS RESOLUTION TODAY SO HONORING HIM, AND, BY EXTENSION, BRINGING FORWARD THE NAMING OF THE BRIDGES WHICH TOO WILL ENSURE THAT HIS MEMORY IS LONG. FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
02:29:07.338: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. THE HONOR OF WORKING AS THEN -- DEBBIE DINGELL'S SPECIAL ASSISTANT IN 2014 FOR HER CONGRESSIONAL CAMPAIGN, AND FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO KNOW HER, SHE WORKS TIRELESSLY, AND EVERY MOMENT THAT SHE IS IN DISTRICT, SHE SPENDS GETTING FROM ONE PLACE TO GET NEXT TO GET WITH HER PEOPLE, AND THAT MEANT THAT HER DAYS STARTED AT 6:00 A.M. AND ENDED AT 9:00 P.M., WHICH MEANT THAT MY DAYS STARTED AT 6:00 A.M. AND 9:00 P.M. STARTING IN DEARBORN, AND ONE OF THE HIGHLIGHTS EVERY DAY WAS GETTING TO SEE JOHN'S FACE WHENEVER HE WAS IN DISTRICT AND NOT IN DC. HE HAD THE ABILITY TO MAKE WHOEVER HE WAS SPEAKING TO FEEL IMPORTANT, AND THAT COMES WITH AN IMMENSE AMOUNT OF HUMILITY FOR SOMEONE PEOPLE HAVE CALLED THE MOST POWERFUL PERSON IN WASHINGTON TO NEVER BE ELECTED PRESIDENT. HE HAD THE ABILITY TO MAKE PEOPLE FEEL SPECIAL, AND IT TAKES AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF HUMILITY THAT HE CARRIED WITH HIM EVERY DAY, AND WITH THAT -- YOU WOULDN'T KNOW WHAT HE HAS DONE. IF YOU WERE TO LIST HIS ACCOMPLISHMENTS, AMONG THEM WOULD BE HELPING TO PASS MEDICARE AND MEDICAID, THE CLEAN AIR ACT AND THE CLEAN WATER ACT, THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS THAT HE DID BEHIND THE SCENES TO HELP CONSTITUENTS FOR 59 YEARS, TEN OF WHICH HE REPRESENTED ANN ARBOR. IT WOULD TAKE 59 YEARS TO LIST THEM ALL. AMONG EXAMPLES OF THESE, THE WAYS IN WHICH HE FOUGHT FOR HIS CONSTITUENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE SAFE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE NEED TO THRIVE, A STATE-OF-THE-ART TRAIN STATION IN DEARBORN, STATE-OF-THE-ART INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT JUST 25 MILES FROM HERE, AND A STADIUM BRIDGE THAT WE STRUGGLED TO REPAIR OURSELVES. AND WE OWE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT TO HIM. IT JUST STANDS TESTAMENT TO HOW HE PUT HIS COUNTRY, HIS CONSTITUENTS, HIS FAMILY, HIS FRIENDS AND HIS STAFF BEFORE HIMSELF EVERY DAY OF HIS LIFE, AND THIS IS A SMALL NOD TO THAT SACRIFICE. SO, THANKS.
02:31:45.997: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
02:31:47.232: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR, THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN. YOUR PERSONAL EXPERIENCES OF HAVING HAD THIS INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY AND EXPOSURE TO THE DINGELLS, CONGRESSMAN AND CONGRESSWOMAN DINGELL, IS NICE TO, YOU KNOW, APPRECIATE FROM YOUR, AGAIN, FIRSTHAND EXPERIENCE. THANK YOU FOR SHARING THAT. I AM SURE IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE. AND I WOULD JUST LIKE TO ASK TO HAVE MY NAME BE ADDED AS A SPONSOR. I AM SURE PROBABLY EVERYBODY HERE SITTING AT THIS TABLE WILL MAKE A SIMILAR REQUEST, BECAUSE THIS IS APPROPRIATE, CERTAINLY, AND HIS RECORD OF SERVICE, 59 YEARS OF SERVICE IS EXTRAORDINARY AND WORTHY OF RECOGNITION. CONGRESSMAN DINGELL IS CERTAINLY WORTHY. IT'S A VERY WELL WRITTEN RESOLUTION, AND I FOUND IT WORTH READING OVER, JUST TO REMIND US OF HIS INCREDIBLE LIFE AND SERVICE. SO, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR INITIATING THIS AND FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD, AND TO ALL OF THE SPONSORS. AND THANK YOU FOR ADDING MY NAME.
02:33:07.378: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
02:33:08.579: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  THANK YOU, AND I APPRECIATE THE WORDS THAT HAVE BEEN SPOKEN ON THE FORMER CONGRESSMAN, A CHAMPION OF PEOPLE, NO DOUBT, AND I JUST WILL MAKE THIS BRIEF. I JUST WANTED TO BE ADDED AS A COSPONSOR. IT'S ONLY FITTING THAT WE ARE RENAMING A BRIDGE, I THINK. YOU KNOW, IT'S SYMBOLIC, AND HE WAS ABLE TO BRIDGE THE DIFFERENCES, BRIDGE THE GAPS, GET EFFECTIVE LEGISLATION PASSED IN OUR COUNTRY THAT AFFECTED MILLIONS OF PEOPLE, SO AGAIN, IT'S JUST VERY FITTING THAT WE WILL REMEMBER HIM IN SO MANY GREAT WAYS, AND THIS RESOLUTION IS REALLY WELL WRITTEN, TREMENDOUS ACCOMPLISHMENTS BY MR. DINGELL.
02:34:01.833: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
02:34:02.700: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  THANK YOU. I JUST HAVE A TECHNICAL QUESTION. SO THAT BRIDGE HAS A PLAQUE THAT WAS DEDICATED WHEN IT OPENED, AND ARE WE GOING TO REPLACE THAT OR AMEND IT WITH ANOTHER PLAQUE? OR HOW IS THIS GOING TO HAPPEN? AND JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY, DOES THE MONEY HAVE TO COME FROM STREETS OR GENERAL FUND? I FULLY SUPPORT THIS NOTION. I'M JUST CURIOUS.
02:34:23.521: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  I'LL LEAVE THAT TO STAFF.
02:34:25.590: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  OKAY. I MEAN ONLY BECAUSE I KNOW THAT, YOU KNOW, AN INSTALLED PLAQUE MIGHT BE A COUPLE GRAND.
02:34:36.768: >> CRAIG HUPY, PUBLIC SERVICES AREA ADMINISTRATOR. WE HAVEN'T DISCUSSED IT IN DETAIL, BUT MY FIRST THOUGHT WOULD BE THAT WE WOULD ADD THE PLAQUE TO IT, AND IT WOULD BE COMING OUT OF STREETS.
02:34:50.548: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER: THANKS. I JUST -- YOU KNOW, IT DIDN'T SAY, SO I APPRECIATE IT. WHAT'S THAT? WELL, I MEAN, I THINK IT IS GREAT. YOU KNOW, I CERTAINLY HAD MY OPPORTUNITIES TO MEET MR. DINGELL, AND, YOU KNOW, I SUPPORTED MANY OF THE NOTIONS THAT HE SUPPORTED OVER THE YEARS, SO I'M ALL IN FAVOR OF THIS, AND THE LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS CONSISTENTLY RANK HIM VERY HIGH, AND IT'S ALL WELL AND GOOD. HE DID GOOD WORK FOR OUR COMMUNITY.
02:35:16.674: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER SMITH.
02:35:17.575: >> COUNCILMEMBER SMITH: CLEARLY, WE WOULDN'T HAVE BUILT THOSE BRIDGES WITHOUT HIS HELP, SO PLEASE ADD ME AS A COSPONSOR.
02:35:24.849: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
02:35:25.716: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  I WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A COSPONSOR AS WELL. I ONLY MOVED TO TOWN IN 2004, WHEN THAT BRIDGE WAS FAMOUSLY FALLING APART, AND SO IT'S -- THE STORY IS LEGEND OF MR. DINGELL GETTING THE FUNDS TO FIX THAT BRIDGE FOR US, AND IT IS THE BEST BRIDGE IN WARD 4. [ OFF-MICROPHONE COMMENT ].
02:35:49.607: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  [ LAUGHTER ] COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
02:35:50.775: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD: YEAH, I HAD MANY CONVERSATIONS WITH JOHN DINGELL THE LAST FEW YEARS OF HIS LIFE, AND THEY WERE ALWAYS MEMORABLE, AND I ALWAYS LOOKED FORWARD TO HIS PERSPECTIVE AND GUIDANCE, AND I REMEMBER AFTER OUR PRESIDENT WAS ELECTED MOST RECENTLY, PEOPLE WERE REALLY DEPRESSED. I HAD FRIENDS THAT LITERALLY WOULD NOT GET OUT OF BED FOR TWO DAYS, THEY WERE JUST SO, SO DEPRESSED, AND SO I SAID TO HIM, I SAID, WELL, I THINK THAT YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON THIS IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE YOU'VE LIVED SO LONG AND YOU'VE LIVED THROUGH WORLD WAR II AND ALL OF THESE OTHER WARS, AND SO FROM A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE, THIS REALLY ISN'T THAT BAD, AND HE LOOKED AT ME AND SAID, "YES, IT IS," AND THAT'S ALL HE SAID, AND THAT JUST WAS SO POWERFUL. SO, I AM THRILLED THAT WE ARE NAMING THE BRIDGES AFTER HIM.
02:36:50.034: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER AND THEN LUMM.
02:36:56.574: >> COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER: JUST A QUICK, I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO BE A COSPONSOR. THANK YOU.
02:37:00.778: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
02:37:01.612: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  JUST VERY QUICKLY, ONE OF THE THINGS COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN MENTIONED IS THAT WHEN YOU OR ANYONE SPOKE WITH CONGRESSMAN DINGELL, YOU FELT THAT YOU WERE ALL HIS, I GUESS, IF THAT'S AN OKAY WAY TO PUT IT, BUT THAT HE WAS ENTIRELY FOCUSED ON YOU, WHAT YOU HAD TO SAY, THAT HE WAS A GREAT LISTENER, AND AS WE WELL KNOW, IN A RECENT MEETING, CONGRESSMAN DINGELL SAID THERE'S A REASON WE HAVE TWO EARS AND ONE OF THESE, SO LISTENING IS IMPORTANT, AND I WILL JUST SAY, YOU KNOW, ON THE VARIOUS TRIBUTES THAT WERE MADE TO CONGRESSMAN JOHN DINGELL AFTER HE PASSED AWAY, NOLAN FINLEY OF THE DETROIT NEWS, SO A CONSERVATIVE WRITER, MADE THAT VERY SAME OBSERVATION. IT TURNS OUT HE AND CONGRESSMAN DINGELL WERE FAST FRIENDS OVER THE YEARS, PROFESSIONALLY, PERSONALLY, AND HE MADE THAT SAME OBSERVATION. I THINK THAT'S VERY, VERY MEANINGFUL, AND IT SPEAKS TO THE INTEGRITY OF THE MAN AND HIS ABILITY TO BRIDGE DIFFERENCES WITH VARIOUS FOLKS, AND THAT IS SORELY LACKING IN SO MANY OF OUR LIVES TODAY. SO, I'M JUST ADDING ON TO WHAT COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN OBSERVED ABOUT HIS WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE IN WORKING WITH THE CONGRESSMAN.
02:38:41.145: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [ CHORUS OF AYES ] ALL OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. AND LET THE RECORD SHOW, IT IS UNANIMOUS. DB1, RESOLUTION TO APPROVE THE HOSFORD ANNEXATION, 2.56 ACRES, 2260 TRAVER ROAD, MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN. DISCUSSION, PLEASE, OF DB1. COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
02:39:06.070: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. BECAUSE OF SCHEDULING CONFLICTS, NO MEMBER OF THE PLANNING STAFF WAS ABLE TO JOIN US TONIGHT. IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS, THEY INVITED COUNCILMEMBERS TO POSTPONE IF THEY FELT THE NEED. THEY WOULD BE HAPPY TO JOIN FOR THE NEXT MEETING.
02:39:19.116: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
02:39:20.051: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  YEAH, I WOULD ALSO BE HAPPY TO ANSWER THEM. THIS PARCEL IS, YOU KNOW, IT SCORES VERY HIGH. IT'S AN EXCELLENT LOCATION FOR ADDING TO OUR PARKS. IT PROTECTS THE WATERSHED AT THE END OF OUR PARKS. YOU KNOW, IT WAS HAD FOR A REASONABLE PRICE, AND I THINK EVERYBODY FEELS THAT IT -- THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS IS, ESPECIALLY THE WATERSHED, IT'S SORT OF AN UNDEVELOPABLE PARCEL BY MOST SENSES BECAUSE OF ITS RUNOFF INTO THE EXISTING KIND OF PSEUDOWETLANDS THERE, AND I DON'T KNOW, I THINK IT'S A DECENT DEAL FOR THE CITY. YOU KNOW, I HAD WISHED THAT WE COULD HAVE COME TO AGREEMENT ON ALL THREE PARTS OF THIS PARCEL, ALL THREE PARCELS THAT MAKE UP THIS ENTIRE PROPERTY, BUT, YOU KNOW, IT JUST WASN'T THERE FOR THE HOUSE, AND SO I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE US TO GO AHEAD AND VOTE FOR THIS. I THINK IT'S A GOOD -- IT'S A GOOD ADDITION TO OUR PARKS SYSTEM. IT'S GOING TO EXPAND THEM IN A WAY THAT I THINK IS APPROPRIATE.
02:40:28.853: >> YEAH.
02:40:30.821: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN AND THEN LUMM.
02:40:32.123: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN:  JUST TO CLARIFY, THIS IS A RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY.
02:40:37.328: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  WELL, JULIE, I BELIEVE THAT -- OR COUNCILMEMBER GRAND, THE ADDRESS --
02:40:43.300: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRAND:  IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING -- IS IT OKAY --
02:40:47.104: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  SURE.
02:40:48.739: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRAND:  MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THIS PIECE WAS THE RESIDENTIAL PIECE, AND THE OTHER PIECE WAS THE PARK PIECE. THIS WAS THE RESIDENTIAL PIECE. THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO SEWER WATER, SO THEY ARE ASKING FOR IT AND ASKING TO BE ANNEXED INTO THE CITY, AND -- [ OFF MIC ] -- YEAH, YEAH. THIS IS NOT A PURCHASE. THIS IS ANNEXING.
02:41:12.830: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  THAT'S GOING TO PRICE IT RIGHT OUT.
02:41:15.666: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN:  THAT WAS MY COMMENT.
02:41:16.867: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
02:41:18.102: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY, I THINK WE SHOULD ACT ON THIS, BECAUSE IT'S JUST A GARDEN VARIETY ANNEXATION, IF YOU WILL. THE PETITIONER REQUESTED ANNEXATION BECAUSE THE SEPTIC IS FAILING, AND THEY WANT TO HOOK UP TO THE CITY SANITARY, AND IT'S WITHIN THE CITY WATER SEWER DISTRICT, AND IT WILL BE PROPOSED AS R1B, WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE ADJACENT ZONING AND LAND USES. SO HENCE, YOU KNOW, THE STAFF AND PLANNING COMMISSION'S SUPPORT.
02:41:51.235: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
02:41:52.102: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  SORRY FOR MY CONFUSION ON THIS. SO, HOW ARE WE GOING TO -- WHERE ARE THEY RUNNING THAT? WHERE ARE THEY GOING TO RUN THAT FROM? I'M JUST CURIOUS HOW THIS PHYSICAL CONNECTION TO OUR WATER AND SEWER IS GOING TO HAPPEN OUT THERE IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHER NOWHERESVILLE. IS IT COMING ACROSS THE STREET, OR THROUGH LESLIE? I'M GLAD THEY ARE ASKING. WE KNOW THESE ANNEXATIONS AREN'T ALWAYS INTO IT, BUT THESE ARE ALL TOWNSHIP ISLANDS, SO I'M JUST CURIOUS HOW THAT --
02:42:22.600: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN:  I MEAN, NO, IF I -- IF I COULD --
02:42:27.171: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN --
02:42:28.272: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  I KNOW PLANNING TOOK A BETTER LOOK AT IT, OBVIOUSLY.
02:42:31.308: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN:  I'LL SAY IT AGAIN, IF NEED BE, WE CAN POSTPONE AND QUESTIONS CAN BE ANSWERED OFFLINE.
02:42:38.148: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  THAT'S FINE.
02:42:38.983: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN:  I'M LOOKING AT THE MAP, AND IT'S PRETTY SOLIDLY IN THE CITY, I WOULD IMAGINE. IT'S GOING TO COME THROUGH EITHER ON TRAVER OR THROUGH ONE OF THE ADJACENT NEIGHBORHOODS TO THE NORTHEAST, BUT I'M NOT GOING TO BE THE ONE LAYING THE PIPE.
02:42:55.599: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  IT'S ALL UNIMPROVED ROAD, IS WHY I'M ASKING. I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM MOVING FORWARD. I WAS JUST VERY CURIOUS TO HEAR THAT.
02:43:03.073: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [ CHORUS OF AYES ] OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. DS1, RESOLUTION TO APPROPRIATE $5,000.00 FROM GENERAL FUND TO FUND ADDITIONAL TASKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPREHENSIVE TRANSPORTATION PLAN UPDATE PROJECT AND TO APPROVE AN AMENDMENT TO THE PROFESSIONAL SERVICES AGREEMENT WITH SAM SCHWARTZ CONSULTING, LLC IN THE AGGREGATION OF $356,870, MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER GRAND. DISCUSSION, PLEASE, OF DS1. COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
02:43:40.177: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD:  I TALKED TO OUR CITY ADMINISTRATOR BEFORE THIS MEETING ABOUT ANOTHER OPTION THAT WOULD ELIMINATE THE NEED TO SPEND THIS MONEY, AND I THINK WE POSTPONED THIS, AND THERE HAS BEEN SOME QUESTION ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT WAS ASKED FOR AND WHAT WAS BEING DELIVERED, AND MY GOAL WAS THAT WE BE ABLE TO REALIZE A REDUCTION IN OUR CRASH RATE BY IMPLEMENTING VISION ZERO, AND WHILE WE HAVE A VISION ZERO PROGRAM AND WE HAVE PEOPLE WORKING ON A TRANSPORTATION PLAN, WE HAVE NOT REALIZED ANY SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN OUR CRASH RATE YET, WHEREAS AN OPTION WOULD BE TO WORK WITH GRAND RAPIDS WHERE THEY ARE TWO YEARS AHEAD OF US IN IMPLEMENTING VISION ZERO AND HAVE REALIZED A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN PEDESTRIAN CRASH RATES IN 2018. I DON'T HAVE THE 2019 NUMBERS, BUT I WILL DEFER TO THE CITY ADMINISTRATIVE BECAUSE HE DOES HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR IN GRAND RAPIDS, AND THEY SEEM QUITE WILLING TO SHARE SOME OF THEIR SUCCESS.
02:44:59.690: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
02:45:01.025: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN: WASN'T THERE MENTION OF A POSTPONEMENT?
02:45:05.229: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  I'M SORRY. I MUST HAVE BEEN SPACING.
02:45:07.231: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN:  NO, NOT NOW, BUT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE MEETING.
02:45:14.905: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THERE WAS, BUT THERE HAS BEEN NO MOTION.
02:45:17.241: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN:  I MOVE -- IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE MIGHT BE A COMPETING RESOLUTION OR A COMPETING IDEA COMING FORWARD.
02:45:28.852: >> I WOULD DEFER TO THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR SINCE IT IS A STAFF RESOLUTION.
02:45:34.191: >> CITY ADMIN. LAZARUS:  COUNCIL PASSED A RESOLUTION SEVERAL MONTHS AGO --
02:45:39.029: >> IN OCTOBER.
02:45:40.764: >> CITY ADMIN. LAZARUS:  ASKING US TO ENGAGE WITH SAM SCHWARTZ TO DO AN EVALUATION OF SOME OF OUR NONMOTORIZED INFRASTRUCTURE. WE HAVE GOTTEN INTO A LITTLE BIT OF A CIRCULAR DISCUSSION, BECAUSE THE COST IS MORE, I THINK, THAN COUNCIL ENVISIONED TO HAVE SAM SCHWARTZ DO IT. WE ALSO TO BE PRUDENT AS IT RELATES TO EXPENDITURE OF CITY FUNDS. MS. GRISWOLD APPROACHED ME, AS SHE JUST MENTIONED, THAT IN GRAND RAPIDS THEY HAVE SOME EXPERTISE ON STAFF WHO MAY BE WILLING TO ASSIST US RATHER THAN US PAYING MORE MONEY THAN WAS INITIALLY ENVISIONED. MR. WASHINGTON, WHO IS THE CITY MANAGER IN GRAND RAPIDS, AND I HAVE A VERY STRONG RELATIONSHIP. WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT STAFF EXCHANGES IN THE PAST, SO I THINK MS. GRISWOLD'S RECOMMENDATION IS VERY -- IS A GOOD ONE, THAT WE SHOULD GO AND TALK TO THE FOLKS IN GRAND RAPIDS AND SEE IF WE CAN BENEFIT FROM THEIR EXPERTISE. THAT WILL REQUIRE A CHANGE IN THE RESOLUTION COUNCIL PASSED, BECAUSE WE TAKE DIRECTION FROM COUNCIL AS A WHOLE, BUT I THINK IT IS A CASE WHERE A LITTLE BIT OF TAKING THE TIME TO SEE WHAT ORE -- OUR PEER CITIES ARE DOING MAY BE BENEFICIAL -- WILL BE BENEFICIAL.
02:47:08.719: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN:  I THINK I STILL HAVE THE FLOOR. SO DO YOU RECOMMEND THAT WE POSTPONE OR VOTE THIS DOWN?
02:47:15.025: >> CITY ADMIN. LAZARUS:  I THINK BECAUSE COUNCIL PASSED THIS AS A WHOLE TO GIVE US DIRECTION, I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT WE POSTPONE, AND THEN IF WE COME BACK, WE WOULD HAVE TO CHANGE THE RESOLUTION THAT COUNCIL INITIALLY ADOPTED.
02:47:25.702: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN:  HOW LONG WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO THIS?
02:47:27.304: >> I'M GOING TO SEE MR. WASHINGTON THIS WEEKEND. I WITH TALK TO HIM THEN.
02:47:32.609: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN:  TWO WEEKS?
02:47:34.011: >> CITY ADMIN. LAZARUS:  TWO WEEKS IS FINE.
02:47:36.313: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN:  I MOVE TO POSTPONE THIS UNTIL OUR NEXT MEETING.
02:47:43.353: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  DISCUSSION?
02:47:44.488: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  OF COURSE I WILL POSTPONE, BUT I HAVE TO SAY IN TERMS OF THE CIRCUITOUSNESS ABOUT THIS, IT IS NOT ABUNDANTLY CLEAR TO ME WHAT WE ARE POSTPONING THIS TO ACCOMPLISH. SO IT SOUNDS LIKE WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO GO OFF TO TALK TO THE FOLKS IN GRAND RAPIDS, BUT IT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME HOW THEY WILL DO OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE PEDESTRIAN CYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE. I MEAN, I'M NOT -- AGAIN, I'LL SUPPORT POSTPONEMENT, BUT I THINK THROUGHOUT, STAFF HAS BEEN RESPONSIVE TO THE DIRECTION THAT COUNCIL HAS GIVEN THEM. AT THE JANUARY 21ST MEETING WHEN THIS WAS POSTPONED, THE DIRECTION AT THAT MEETING WAS THAT THE INTENT OF THE ORIGINAL RESOLUTION, WHICH WAS -- WE PASSED THAT IN OCTOBER, WAS TO GET AN ASSESSMENT OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE, NOT AN ASSESSMENT OF THE STAFFING RESOURCES. THEN STAFF ASKED SAM SCHWARTZ TO COME BACK WITH A REVISED PROPOSAL, AND THAT'S WHAT THEIR JANUARY 28TH PROPOSAL DID, AND THE SUBSTITUTE RESOLUTION REFLECTS, SO I FOR ONE SUPPORTED THE ORIGINAL, YOU KNOW, COUNCIL RESOLUTION IN OCTOBER, BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO GET AN ASSESSMENT OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE, AND I SUPPORTED THE POSTPONEMENT AT THE LAST MEETING BECAUSE I AGREED WITH MY COLLEAGUES THAT THAT PROPOSAL MISSED THE MARK. IT WAS FOCUSED ON STAFFING AND THE RESOURCES RATHER THAN AN ASSESSMENT OF THE PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE. I APPRECIATE THAT STAFF HAS BEEN RESPONSIVE TO THE DIRECTION AT THE LAST MEETING, SO STAFF THEN ASKED THE CONSULTANT TO COME UP WITH A REVISED PROPOSAL, WHICH THEY HAVE NOW DONE, AND SO THEY HAVE GIVEN US A SUBSTITUTE RESOLUTION. AGAIN, I'M NOT CRAZY ABOUT SPENDING AN ADDITIONAL 22,000, BUT IF WE ARE GOING TO DO A TRANSPORTATION UPDATE PROPERLY, IT SEEMS WE NEED TO INCLUDE AN ASSESSMENT OF THE PEDESTRIAN AND CYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE, AND IT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME HOW -- SO WE ARE GOING TO POSTPONE THIS IN TWO WEEKS. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO NAIL DOWN WITH GRAND RAPIDS OR OTHER BENCHMARK CITIES THAT WILL GET US THERE, TO THAT KIND OF ASSESSMENT? MR. HESS, CAN YOU SPEAK TO THAT PERHAPS?
02:50:04.328: >> CITY ADMIN. LAZARUS:  I DON'T THINK MR. HESS HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN THE CONVERSATION. WHAT MR. HESS DID WAS, AS YOU DESCRIBED, BROUGHT BACK THE PROPOSAL FROM SAM SCHWARTZ THAT WAS COMPLIANT WITH COUNCIL'S DIRECTION, AND WE ARE PREPARED TO DO THAT. IT IS AN ADDITIONAL $23,000.
02:50:23.780: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  I THINK THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE.
02:50:26.016: >> CITY ADMIN. LAZARUS:  IF WE CHOOSE NOT TO DO THAT, THEN WE CAN DISCUSS THE SCOPE OF WORK WITH STAFF IN GRAND RAPIDS AND SEE IF THEY HAVE THE CAPACITY TO ESSENTIALLY MEET THE GIST OF WHAT COUNCIL ASKED FOR.
02:50:40.764: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  TO DO THIS ASSESSMENT FOR US? IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING OR SUGGESTING OR PROPOSING?
02:50:47.838: >> CITY ADMIN. LAZARUS:  THAT'S WHAT I AM -- YES.
02:50:52.442: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
02:50:55.345: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  YES, VERY CIRCULAR HERE. YOU KNOW, WE ARE SPINNING OUR TIRES, I THINK. AT LEAST I FEEL LIKE I AM ON THIS ISSUE. WITH RESPECT TO WHAT COUNCIL ASKED FOR A FEW MONTHS AGO, THIS RESOLUTION DOES NOT ADDRESS THAT ISSUE PER SE. I KNOW WE HAVE THAT OPTION UNDER OPTION 3 THAT DOES REQUIRE ADDITIONAL MONEY, $26,200, AND I THINK THAT ACTUALLY WILL ADDRESS WHAT COUNCIL ASKED FOR MONTHS AGO. THIS $5,000 FRANKLY FALLS SHORT, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT. I UNDERSTAND WE WERE GIVEN OPTIONS, AND I APPRECIATE OPTIONS TO WEIGH OUT AND GIVE US PERSPECTIVE, BUT I WOULD REQUEST AND ASK FOR THAT OPTION 3 BE GIVEN AS AN OPTION WHEN THIS COMES BACK, BECAUSE THIS $5,000 OPTION REALLY DOESN'T ADDRESS MUCH. IT JUST SPENDS $5,000. IF I CAN JUST WEIGH IN ON THAT ISSUE, I JUST DON'T THINK THAT'S REALLY WORTH OUR TIME OR THE MONEY BEING SPENT, AND I DO APPRECIATE, YOU KNOW, GRAND RAPIDS' ASSISTANCE IN HELPING US BE MORE EFFECTIVE AT ADDRESSING OUR ISSUES, OUR GOALS, AND WHAT IS NEEDED TO DO THAT.
02:52:27.704: >> CITY ADMIN. LAZARUS:  IF I COULD HAVE MR. HESS SPEAK, BECAUSE I THINK THE LIST IN THE POSTING IS A LITTLE BIT MISLEADING, BECAUSE IT'S BRINGING BACK WHAT WAS POSTED LAST TIME, BUT THE BODY IS DIFFERENT.
02:52:38.181: >> RIGHT, RAYMOND HESS, TRANSPORTATION MANAGER. SO, TO MR. LAZARUS'S POINT, I THINK THERE IS SOME VERSION ISSUES TO FOLLOW ON THIS. THERE IS A SUBSTITUTE RESOLUTION, WHICH INTRODUCES KIND OF A VERSION 3.2, FOR LACK OF A BETTER TERM. THAT'S THE ONE THAT I THINK COUNCILMEMBER LUMM WAS SPEAKING TO A MOMENT AGO AS WELL, AND IT DOES KIND OF REPLACE THE $5,000 RESOLUTION WITH A NEW SCOPE FROM SAM SCHWARTZ THAT IS SLIGHTLY MODIFIED. IT'S $21,700, AS OPPOSED TO THE $26,200. THAT SCOPE WAS MODIFIED SLIGHTLY BASED ON THE DIRECTION WE GOT FROM CITY COUNCIL AT THE LAST MEETING. SO I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY, I THINK, THE REASON WHY THE 5,000 ONE IS STILL THE ONE IN THE PACKET IS PROBABLY PARLIAMENTARY, QUITE FRANKLY, BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WAS ON YOUR AGENDA LAST TIME, AND IT WAS POSTPONED UNTIL NOW, SO THAT'S WHAT THE AGENDA ITEM READS, BUT THERE IS A REPLACEMENT RESOLUTION THAT WOULD I THINK ADDRESS THE ISSUE THAT YOU'RE BRINGING, WHICH IS CLOSE TO OPTION 3 BUT SLIGHTLY MODIFIED AS WELL.
02:53:43.146: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  SO IN ORDER TO GET FROM POINT A TO POINT B THE QUICKEST, WOULD IT BE PERHAPS ADVISABLE TO VOTE THIS DOWN TO GET TO WHAT WE NEED TO IN THE QUICKEST TIME POSSIBLE?
02:54:00.830: >> CITY ADMIN. LAZARUS:  I THINK AS I STATED, WE ARE PREPARED TO GO FORWARD AND EXECUTE THE -- WITH SAM SCHWARTZ IF THAT'S THE WILL OF THE COUNCIL. THERE IS AN OPTION THAT MAY PROVE TO BE EQUALLY EFFECTIVE THAT MAY COST LESS. ONE OF THE SPONSORS OF THE ORIGINAL RESOLUTION ASKED US TO LOOKED AT IT -- TO LOOK AT IT. IT'S OUR INTENT TO COMPLY WITH THE DIRECTION THAT WE GET FROM COUNCIL AS A WHOLE.
02:54:31.161: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GUIDE THE SHIP HERE, BUT I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE -- WE NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE ASSISTANCE FROM OUR CITY ADMINISTRATOR IN LETTING US KNOW WHAT PATH IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE. OTHERWISE, WE CONTINUE TO GO IN CIRCLES.
02:54:50.046: >> CITY ADMIN. LAZARUS:  WELL, WITH THAT REGARD THEN, I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO SPEAK WITH ANYBODY FROM GRAND RAPIDS YET, SO I DON'T THINK THIS IS PARTICULARLY TIME SENSITIVE, SO I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY -- ANYTHING WRONG WITH -- I KNOW IT'S ANNOYING, BUT WAITING A COUPLE OF MORE WEEKS TO SEE IF WE CAN ESTABLISH THE COLLABORATIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE STAFF THERE, WHICH WE PROBABLY -- WHICH WOULD PROBABLY BE MORE BENEFICIAL LONG-TERM, AS OPPOSED TO BRINGING SOMEBODY IN FROM OUT OF TOWN AND THEN GOING HOME. WE COULD CONTINUE TO EXCHANGE THE BEST PRACTICES. BUT, AGAIN, I WANT TO BE CAREFUL NOT TO NOT COMPLY WITH WHAT COUNCIL ASKED US TO DO.
02:55:33.957: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  I HAVE GOT COUNCILMEMBER EATON, ACKERMAN, HAYNER, AND THEN PERHAPS WE CAN CALL IT A DAY ON THE POSTPONEMENT.
02:55:40.597: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  SO I WANT TO DRAW MY COLLEAGUES' ATTENTION TO THE PACKET ADDENDUM THAT HAS THE SUBSTITUTE RESOLUTION, AND I THINK THAT THE SUBSTITUTE RESOLUTION GETS US MUCH CLOSER TO WHAT WE ASKED FOR IN OCTOBER, BUT I WOULD POINT OUT THAT IT HAS FIVE TASKS FOR A TOTAL OF $21,700, AND I QUESTION THE NEED FOR TASK FOUR OR FIVE. WE GAVE THE DIRECTION. I WOULD HOPE THAT AFTER THE ASSESSMENT IS DONE, IT'S BROUGHT BACK TO US, BECAUSE THAT'S WHO ASKED FOR IT, RATHER THAN TAKING IT TO THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION. I THINK THAT WE COULD REDUCE THE NUMBERS OF HOURS OF WORK AND THE COST OF THIS, AND SO IF WE POSTPONE THIS, I HOPE THAT WE WOULD AGAIN FOCUS ON WHAT WE ORIGINALLY ASKED FOR IN OCTOBER, WHICH I THINK IS TASKS ONE, TWO, AND THREE IN THESE PROPOSED SUBSTITUTE RESOLUTIONS.
02:56:33.483: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN?
02:56:37.120: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN:  NO FURTHER COMMENT.
02:56:41.091: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
02:56:42.358: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  MY QUESTION IS PURELY PROCEDURAL. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY -- I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS AN ALTERNATE RESOLUTION ASSOCIATED WITH THIS, BUT THE RESOLUTION THAT WE'D BE VOTING EITHER TO POSTPONE OR ACCEPT OR REJECT IS NOT THAT, AND SO -- I KNOW THE NOTION IS WE ARE GOING TO POSTPONE THIS, AND IT'S GOING TO COME BACK PROPERLY BEFORE US, SOMETHING THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY VOTE ON, OR ARE WE GOING TO JUST VOTE ON THE $5,000? BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT'S BEFORE US IN THE PRINTED AGENDA AND THAT'S WHAT'S BEFORE ME IN THE ELECTRONIC AGENDA, EXCEPT FOR THAT ONE HAS THE ATTACHMENT 1, 2, AND 3, BUT WHAT WE WOULD BE VOTING ON IS THE WHEREAS AND THE RESOLVED CLAUSE THAT SAYS 5,000, AND SO IT'S A PROCEDURAL QUESTION:  ARE WE OR ARE WE NOT VOTING ON THIS? YOU PUT SOMETHING BEFORE ME TO VOTE ON, IT'S GOT TO BE WHAT WE ARE VOTING ON, SO I'M POSTPONING 5,000 AND HOPING IT COMES BACK DIFFERENTLY. IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME?
02:57:37.480: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
02:57:38.348: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  WHAT HAS BEEN MOVED TO BE POSTPONED IS THE DS1 SUBSTITUTE RESOLUTION, WHICH IS OPTION 3. IT'S AN ATTACHMENT, AND IT'S TO APPROPRIATE $21,700 TO AMEND THIS AGREEMENT AND APPROPRIATE THIS MONEY TO AMEND THIS AGREEMENT WITH SAM SCHWARTZ CONSULTING, AND I DO APPRECIATE THE CLARIFYING DIRECTION PROVIDED BY COUNCILMEMBER EATON ON THE TASKS THAT ARE ENUMERATED, AND I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY HOURS AND THE ASSOCIATED COSTS TASKS FOUR AND FIVE WOULD REPRESENT, BUT THAT SOUNDS LIKE A FINE RECOMMENDATION TO ME TO ASK THE CONSULTANT TO PROVIDE AN ASSESSMENT OF THE PEDESTRIAN AND BICYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE, WHICH WOULD INVOLVE THE FIRST THREE TASKS, AND THEN, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE THE REPORT, AND THAT SHOULD BE, I WOULD HOPE, SUFFICIENT. AND SAVE A FEW MORE DOLLARS.
02:58:43.346: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE POSTPONEMENT? COUNCILMEMBERS GRISWOLD AND HAYNER, AND THEN MAYBE WE VOTE.
02:58:51.988: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD:  I WANT TO REITERATE THAT I THINK WE SHOULD FOLLOW THE LEAD OF THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR AND POSTPONE THIS AND SEE WHAT CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED WITHOUT ADDITIONAL FUNDING. 21,000 IS $21,000 THAT WE COULD BE USING FOR STREETLIGHTS, FOR PAINTING CROSS-WALKS, FOR ACTUAL INFRASTRUCTURE, AND THAT IS MUCH BETTER SPENT IF WE HAVE THAT OPTION.
02:59:14.878: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
02:59:16.412: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  I'LL JUST SAY WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THIS CAME BEFORE US LAST TIME, SO I DON'T FEEL THAT IT'S COMPREHENSIVE IF IT DIDN'T INCLUDE THE THINGS THAT WE ARE ASKING FOR, SO I'LL SUPPORT THE POSTPONEMENT OR THE VOTING DOWN THIS NOTION. I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT WE DON'T MAINTAIN AND HAVEN'T HAD OUR OWN INVENTORY OF BIKE LANES AND CROSSWALKS AND CROSSWALK SIGNAGE AND ALL OF THAT STUFF. THEN WHY DO WE NEED SOMEBODY ELSE TO TELL US WHAT IT IS?
02:59:39.769: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE --
02:59:47.143: >> [ OFF MIC ].
02:59:47.744: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  -- ON THE POSTPONEMENT STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER. HAYNER?
02:59:51.214: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:
02:59:52.048: >> COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER: YES. GRISWOLD?
02:59:53.816: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD:  YES. LUMM?
02:59:54.684: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  YES. GRAND?
02:59:55.652: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRAND:  YES.
02:59:57.120: >> CITY CLERK:  COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN?
02:59:58.922: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN:  YES.
03:00:00.857: >> CITY CLERK:  MAYOR TAYLOR?
03:00:01.457: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  YES. NELSON?
03:00:03.493: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  YES. SMITH?
03:00:05.028: >> COUNCILMEMBER SMITH:  NO.
03:00:05.628: >> CITY CLERK:  COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
03:00:07.597: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  YES.
03:00:08.831: >> CITY CLERK:  THE MOTION CARRIES.
03:00:11.167: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  DO WE HAVE COMMUNICATIONS TODAY FROM OUR CITY ATTORNEY?
03:00:17.640: >> CITY ATTY. POSTEMA:  NO, MAYOR.
03:00:20.677: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  MAY HAVE A MOTION PLEASE TO APPROVE THE CLERK'S REPORT, MOVED BY BY COUNCILMEMBER SMITH, SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI. DISCUSSION OF THE CLERK'S REPORT? ALL IN FAVOR? [ CHORUS OF AYES ] OPPOSED? THE CLERK'S REPORT IS CLOSED. WE NOW COME TO PUBLIC COMMENT GENERAL TIME, AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO SPEAK TO COUNCIL AND COMMUNITY ABOUT MATTERS OF MUNICIPAL INTEREST. TO SPEAK, ONE NEED NOT HAVE SIGNED UP IN ADVANCE. SPEAKERS HAVE THREE MINUTES MINUTES IN WHICH TO SPEAK, SO PLEASE PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE TIME CLOCK. AS A MATTER OF COURTESY, WE MAY ONLY HAVE ONE PERSON SPEAKING AT A TIME, AND FINALLY, IF YOU REQUIRE ASSISTANCE IN SPEAKING BEFORE COUNCIL TODAY, WE'D BE DELIGHTED TO PROVIDE IT TO YOU. IS THERE ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK FOR PUBLIC COMMENT?
03:01:05.421: >> I EMAILED YOU ABOUT THE MOBILITY COMMITTEE AND THE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTIVE FOR CITY STAFF, URGING YOU TO -- SPECIFICALLY THE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTIVE, VOTE THAT DOWN. I AM OKAY WITH THE POSTPONEMENT OF THE MOBILITY RESOLUTION BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE THE INTENT WAS NOT TO SUBVERT THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION, BUT I WOULD LIKE TO REQUEST MORE CLARITY OVER WHAT'S -- ONE THAT COMES BACK FROM COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD, MORE CLARITY ABOUT WHAT EXACTLY THE INTENT IS W WITH -- IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S PROPERLY DEALING WITH EXTERNAL, LIKE THE STATE OR SOMETHING, BUT USING MORE SPECIFIC WORDS ABOUT MOBILITY, MOBILITY IS A VERY GENERAL TERM, AND SPECIFICALLY WHAT THAT WOULD INVOLVE. AND THEN FOR THE COMMUNICATIONS WITH CITY STAFF MOTION, I WAS -- I WOULD RATHER SEE THAT VOTED DOWN, BECAUSE AS I SAID IN MY EMAIL, I THINK THE CITY STAFF ARE OPERATING IN GOOD FAITH, AND IF THERE'S PROBLEMS WITH THINGS SLIPPING THROUGH THE CRACKS MAKING IT UP TO COUNCIL, I WOULD RATHER SEE MORE PROCEDURAL GUIDANCE, MAYBE FROM THE ADMINISTRATOR OR SOMETHING, THAN REQUIREMENTS TO CC COUNCIL ON AN EMAIL, WHICH SEEMS LIKE A VERY -- IT SEEMS LIKE A BLUNT TOOL FOR THE JOB, WHEREAS A MORE -- SOMETHING MORE PROCEDURAL OR NOT JUST CC'ING ON AN EMAIL WOULD BE BETTER. IF I WERE A CITY EMPLOYEE, I WOULD BE INTIMIDATED BY THE FACT THAT I WOULD BE REQUIRED TO CC EFFECTIVELY MY BOSSES OR THE CITY COUNCIL ON THINGS THAT I'M NOT YET READY TO BRING TO THEM. SO, THAT'S IT. THANK YOU.
03:03:12.014: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT?
03:03:21.591: >> HELLO, EVERYONE. I THINK BY NOW THAT Y'ALL KNOW LIKE WHAT ISSUES ARE REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME, WHAT I THINK NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED, SO I HOPE I'M NOT SOUNDING LIKE A BROKEN RECORD EVERY TIME, BUT I HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT SOME STUFF ONLINE, READING SOME ARTICLES I HAPPENED UPON, AND ONE IS FROM FINLAND. I DON'T KNOW IF ANYBODY HAS HEARD THAT THEY ARE THE ONE COUNTRY IN EUROPE WHO HAVE CUT HOMELESSNESS DOWN LIKE SUBSTANTIALLY. THE FIGURES ARE STAGGERING, AND ONE OUTCOME OF THAT WAS THAT THEY USED A HOUSING-FIRST INITIATIVE, WHICH HAS BEEN USED IN SOME CITIES IN THIS COUNTRY. THEY ACTUALLY TOOK THAT AND EXPANDED UPON THAT, WHEREAS INSTEAD OF TELLING A HOMELESS PERSON, YOU KNOW, YOU NEED TO GET A JOB, YOU NEED TO GO TO REHAB, DO ALL OF THIS STUFF, AND THEN YOU'LL BE ABLE TO FIND A PLACE TO LIVE, THE HOUSING FIRST, THE CITY AND THE WHOLE COUNTRY INCREASED THE SUPPLY TO A POINT WITH LOW-INCOME HOUSING, GIVING PEOPLE A PLACE TO LIVE, AND THEN WITH A ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD, THEY ARE ABLE TO TAKE THESE OTHER STEPS.  AND SO THAT BRINGS ME TO JUST A PERSONAL ANECDOTE OF OVER THE SUMMER, SPRING-SUMMER, I SAW THIS YOUNG MAN ABOUT 23 YEARS OLD, HE WAS WITH A BIG BIKE AND A HUGE BACKPACK STUFFED WITH ALL OF HIS POSSESSING WALKING AROUND EVERY DAY, JUST ASKING PEOPLE FOR MONEY. YOU KNOW, I WOULD GIVE HIM A COUPLE OF DOLLARS HERE AND THERE WHEN I COULD, AND I SAT DOWN WITH HIM A COUPLE OF TIMES AND TALKED TO HIM FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS, COLLECTIVELY, AND KIND OF -- HIS FATHER HAD COMMITTED SUICIDE WHEN HE WAS 16, AND FROM HIS BROTHER, HE GOT INTO HEROIN, AND WAS DEALING WITH DRUG ADDICTION SINCE THAT TIME, AND JUST ONE DAY, I WAS LIKE, YOU KNOW, I KNOW THERE IS SERVICES AVAILABLE IN THE CITY AND THE COUNTY, AND I LOOKED SOME THINGS UP, AND I KIND OF WENT AROUND WITH HIM TO A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT PLACES, AND THEN I DIDN'T SEE HIM FOR, YEAH, ABOUT SIX MONTHS, UNTIL LAST WEEK, AND HE DIDN'T HAVE A BIKE, DIDN'T HAVE A BIG BACKPACK. HE SAID HE HAD JUST GOTTEN OUT OF REHAB. HE WAS IN FOR ABOUT SIX MONTHS. HE'S IN TRANSITIONAL HOUSING. HE LOOKED LIKE A TOTALLY DIFFERENT PERSON. HIS MOTHER HAD KIND OF DISOWNED HIM BECAUSE OF THE -- WHAT COMES WITH THE ADDICTION ISSUES AND EVERYTHING, AND HE SAID THAT THEY HAD BEEN TALKING TOGETHER AND DEVELOPING THEIR RELATIONSHIP, SO, YEAH.
03:06:24.240: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT? SEEING NO ONE, PUBLIC COMMENT IS CLOSED. DO WE HAVE -- ARE THERE COMMUNICATIONS FROM COUNCIL? DO WE HAVE A CLOSED SESSION TODAY? OH, I'M SORRY, WAS THERE -- COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
03:06:41.590: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  YEAH, THANK YOU. I KNOW HE'S NOT HERE ANYMORE, BUT I WANT TO SPEAK TO THE GENTLEMAN WHO HAD THE CONCERNS WITH THE CITY AND THE POLICE, AND ANNE AND I SPOKE ABOUT THIS, BECAUSE I BELIEVE IT WAS THE SAME PERSON WHO CAME RUNNING DOWN TO THE FRONT OF THE -- YEAH, THE LECTURE, THE OTHER DAY AT HILL AUDITORIUM, MR. IBRAHIM WITH THE SIGN SAYING HE WAS BEING FRAMED, AND I'M REALLY SORRY WITH THE TROUBLES GOING ON, AND FROM OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THERE HAS BEEN A MIX-UP OF INFORMATION WITH THE LIEN SYSTEM, WHICH IS MONITORED BY THE STATE, AND THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THAT. WE CAN'T GO IN AND MODIFY THE RECORDS, WHERE FINGERPRINTS AND OTHER IDENTIFYING DATA WERE SWITCHED. SO I JUST WANTED TO LET HIM KNOW THAT THE CHIEF IS AWARE OF THIS, AND THE ASSISTANT DEPUTY CHIEF, AND THE FOLKS ON I.T. THERE, AND THEY ARE GOING -- DOING WHAT THEY CAN TO MAKE THE RECOGNITION IN THE FORCE THAT, HEY, THIS ISN'T THE GUY, IT'S A DIFFERENT GUY. AND I CAN'T SPEAK TO EVERYTHING GOING ON, BUT I WISH THAT I COULD GIVE HIM ASSURANCES THAT WE ARE AWARE OF HIS SITUATION AND I'M SORRY FOR HIS TROUBLES.
03:08:02.171: >> COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER:  BY THE FEBRUARY 14TH MEETING, WE WILL BE BRINGING FORTH AN INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT AND TURF GRASS RESOLUTION FOR YOU ALL TO CONSIDER. THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION APPROVED IT, SO NOW IT'S BACK WITH STAFF GETTING IRONED OUT, AND IT'S MAINLY AN EDUCATION AND OUTREACH EFFORT, WHERE WE WOULD USE THE EXISTING PARKS DEPARTMENT INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT FOR PROCEDURES AND GOING INTO THE SPRING HERE, ENCOURAGING ANN ARBOR RESIDENTS AND OWNERS OF LARGE TURF GRASS TO MINIMIZE THEIR PESTICIDES AND CHEMICALS ON OUR LAWNS.
03:08:48.584: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
03:08:50.119: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRAND:  THANK YOU. I JUST SAW A LOT OF POSITIVE COMMENTS ON SOCIAL MEDIA TODAY ABOUT THE OWNERS OF -- AND WANTING TO SUPPORT THEIR BUSINESS IN REALLY BRAVE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT THEY MADE TALKING ABOUT RACIAL DISCRIMINATION IN SOME OF OUR LOCAL SCHOOLS. AND I ALSO, YOU KNOW, HAVE SEEN SOME COMMENTS THAT MAKE IT SOUND LIKE IT'S MAYBE JUST ONE COMMUNITY WHERE THAT HAPPENS, AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT IMPACTS ALL OF US, BUT I WAS REALLY PLEASED TO SEE LOTS OF SUPPORT FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND THAT BUSINESS, BECAUSE THEY DO WONDERFUL THINGS FOR OUR COMMUNITY, AND I JUST WANTED TO EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION.
03:09:30.726: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER COMMUNICATION FROM COUNCIL? DO WE HAVE A CLOSED SESSION TODAY?
03:09:36.599: >> YES, MAYOR.
