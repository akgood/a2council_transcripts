00:00:33.841: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  THANK YOU. DO WE HAVE ANY INTRODUCTIONS THIS EVENING?
00:00:38.379: >> WE DO NOT.
00:00:39.046: >> APPROVAL OF THE AGENDA? MOVED BY COMMISSIONER MILLS, SECOND BY WOODS. MINUTES OF THE PREVIOUS MEETING BEFORE US, WE HAVE THE AUGUST 20TH, 2019, MEETING. DO WE HAVE A COMMISSIONER WHO WILL MOVE? MOVED BY COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL, SECOND BY COMMISSIONER MILLS. ANY DISCUSSION OR CHANGES? ALL THOSE IN FAVOR, PLEASE SAY AYE. [ CHORUS OF AYES ] OPPOSED? THOSE ARE APPROVED. WE MOVE ON TO REPORTS FROM THE COMMITTEES AND WRITTEN COMMUNICATIONS AND PETITIONS. WE'LL BEGIN WITH COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN.
00:01:20.287: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN:  CITY COUNCIL MET LAST NIGHT AND GOT OUT EARLY THIS MORNING. ON PROPERTY SPECIFIC UPDATES, THE CITY EXECUTED ITS RIGHT TO FIRST REFUSAL AT THE PROPERTY OF 1146 SOUTH MAPLE. FOLKS WILL REMEMBER THIS IS ADJACENT TO AN AVALON DEVELOPMENT THAT WE REVIEWED AND PASSED ON TO CITY COUNCIL, PROBABLY OVER A YEAR AGO AT THIS POINT, BUT THE CITY'S PURCHASE OF THIS WOULD ALLOW -- WOULD ENABLE AVALON TO EXPAND THE OPPORTUNITY FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING ON THOSE TWO PARCELS NOW. 2857 PACKARD, ALSO KNOWN AS THE WEBBER PROPERTY, PASSED AT FIRST READING. AND A -- THIS BODY ALSO REVIEWED PLANS FOR AN ANN ASHLEY PARKING STRUCTURE BUILD-OUT. THAT PROPOSAL WAS VOTED DOWN AT CITY COUNCIL. THAT WAS ACTUALLY -- THERE WERE SOME ACTIVE AND PRODUCTIVE DEBATE ABOUT THE SPECIFICS, AND STAFF REQUESTED TO VOTE IT DOWN AND BRING SOMETHING FRESH, JUST BECAUSE IT REQUIRED A LOT MORE NUMBER CRUNCHING. ON ZONING RELATED MATTERS, TWO AMENDMENTS TO THE CHAPTER 55 PASSED AT SECOND READING. THE FIRST WAS ALLOWING RESTAURANT BAR AND FOOD SERVICE USES IN OUR OFFICE DISTRICT. THE SECOND WERE FIXING SOME CLERICAL ERRORS AND UPDATING OUR UDC TO REFLECT OUR FORMER CHAPTER 55. UPDATES ON THE TREELINE TRAIL, WE WERE ABLE TO SECURE AN EASEMENT AT THE KINGSLEY CONDOMINIUM PROPERTY, WHICH WILL ALLOW FOR A POTENTIAL STRETCH OF THE TREELINE TRAIL TO RUN THROUGH THE NEAR DOWNTOWN AREA. AND ADDITIONALLY, WE ARE APPLYING FOR A GRANT TO THE COUNTY TO STUDY THE POSSIBLE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN 721 NORTH MAIN, A CITY OWNED PROPERTY, AND ARGO POND. TRANSPORTATION UPDATES, OF RELEVANCE TO THIS BODY, CITY COUNCIL WILL BE LOOKING AT THE LOWER TOWN MOBILITY STUDY, WHICH WOULD LOOK AT THE REGION AROUND THE INTERSECTION OF PLYMOUTH, TRAVER, AND PONTIAC TRAIL. TWO ROAD RECONFIGURATIONS, WHICH WERE PROPOSED ROAD DIETS THAT WOULD PROVIDE ADDED AMENITIES FOR CYCLIST AND IS PEDESTRIANS. ON TRAVERWOOD DRIVE ON THE NORTHEAST SIDE OF TOWN, ONE PROPOSAL HAS BEEN KIND OF CYCLING BETWEEN VERSIONS, AND WE ARE SOLICITING MORE INPUT FROM INSTITUTIONAL STAKEHOLDERS, LIKE THE ISLAMIC CENTER AND A COUPLE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN FACILITIES IN THE AREA. THE SECOND ON GREEN ROAD, ALSO ON THE NORTHEAST SIDE OF TOWN, FAILED AT CITY COUNCIL. AND, FINALLY, I WILL BE LEAVING THIS BODY. I WAS NOT ABLE TO SECURE ENOUGH VOTES FOR REAPPOINTMENT. IT'S BEEN AN HONOR AND A PLEASURE TO SERVE WITH YOU. I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY WHAT THE MAYOR'S TIMELINE IS FOR NOMINATING A REPLACEMENT CITY COUNCIL REPRESENTATIVE, BUT THIS HAS BEEN A DISTINCT HONOR OF MY TENURE ON CITY COUNCIL. SO, THANK YOU.
00:04:31.044: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  THANK YOU. I AM SURE WE'LL HAVE MORE THOUGHTS ON THAT LATER IN THE MEETING. MOVING ON TO PLANNING MANAGER, MR. KOWALSKI, DO YOU HAVE ANY REPORT FOR US?
00:04:40.821: >> I DO NOT HAVE A REPORT TONIGHT.
00:04:45.659: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  PLANNING OFFICERS AND COMMITTEES? COMMISSIONER BRIGGS.
00:04:49.029: >> COMISSIONER BRIGGS:  JUST AN UPDATE THAT THE MASTER PLAN CONSULTANTS THAT HAVE PUT IN PROPOSALS, THOSE INTERVIEWS ARE GOING TO BE HAPPENING IN A COUPLE WEEKS, SO THAT PROCESS IS MOVING FORWARD.
00:05:04.011: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  GREAT. ANY OTHER -- ALL RIGHT. WRITTEN COMMUNICATIONS AND PETITIONS, I BELIEVE WE RECEIVED TWO LETTERS THAT ARE IN OUR PACKET. SO, PLEASE TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. AND NOW MOVING ON TO AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION. IF THERE IS ANYONE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION IN REGARDS TO AN ITEM THAT IS NOT ON OUR AGENDA, THIS IS YOUR OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION. SO IF YOU ARE HERE IN REGARDS TO HIDEAWAY LANE OR VIC VILLAGE SOUTH, WE'LL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THAT IN A LITTLE BIT, BUT IS THERE ANYONE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO CURRENTLY WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION ON AN ITEM THAT IS NOT ON THE AGENDA THIS EVENING? IF SO, PLEASE STEP UP TO THE PODIUM. SEEING NO ONE, I WILL MOVE ON TO PUBLIC HEARINGS SCHEDULED FOR NEXT BUSINESS MEETING, WHICH WE HAVE NONE.
00:05:49.456: >> WE DO NOT HAVE ANY.
00:05:51.024: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  SO I AM NOT SURE WHAT WILL HAPPEN AT THAT MEETING, BUT WE WILL MOST LIKELY HAVE A MEETING.
00:05:55.562: >> YES, WE'LL KEEP YOU POSTED ON THE DETAILS.
00:05:58.499: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  SO NOW MOVING ON TO REGULAR BUSINESS, THE FIRST ITEM IS HIDEAWAY LANE PLANNED PROJECT SITE PLAN FOR CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL, AND WE WILL BEGIN WITH THE PETITIONER'S PRESENTATION. THE PETITIONER WILL HAVE UP TO TEN MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION, AT WHICH TIME WE WILL THEN HEAD OVER TO STAFF TO GET A STAFF REPORT, AND THEN WE'LL OPEN IT UP FOR PUBLIC HEARING BEFORE OUR DISCUSSION. SO, PLEASE.
00:06:23.223: >> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. MY NAME IS MICHAEL POWELL. I'M THE DESIGN ENGINEER FOR THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT, AND MY ADDRESS IS 4700 CORNERSTONE DRIVE AND WHITE LAKE, AND IF YOU DON'T HOLD IT AGAINST ME, I'M A U OF M GRAD AS WELL, SO IT'S NICE TO BE BACK IN MY HOMETOWN HERE. THIS PROJECT, UNLESS YOU'RE MUCH OLDER THAN I AM, HAS BEEN AROUND A LONG TIME. THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT STARTED IN 1965, IN WHICH IT WAS PART OF A PLANNED DEVELOPMENT THAT FAR BACK. NINE OF THE ORIGINAL UNITS WERE CONSTRUCTED AND STILL EXIST ON THE SITE. APPROXIMATELY 15 YEARS AGO, THAT WAS MODIFIED TO A SITE CONDO STATUS, CONSISTING OF 18 SINGLE-FAMILY HOME SITES. THE CONSTRUCTION STARTED APPROXIMATELY THREE YEARS AGO, IN WHICH THREE OF THE BASEMENTS WERE DUG AS PART OF THAT ORIGINAL APPROVAL, AND AS YOU CAN WELL IMAGINE, THE ECONOMY DELAYED IT MANY, MANY YEARS DURING THE MIDDLE 2000s. THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT, AS YOU CAN SEE BEFORE YOU, HAS -- STARTED OUT AS A SINGLE-FAMILY HOMESITE, AND AS THE DEVELOPER STARTED CONSTRUCTION ON IT, HE SOON FOUND THAT THE CONSTRUCTION COST AND THE SALES PRICES FOR THESE HOMES WOULD BE MUCH LARGER THAN WHAT THE AREA CAN REALLY AFFORD, SO, AS PART OF AN ECONOMICAL EFFICIENT HOME SALES AND FOR RENTALS, HE DECIDED TO APPROACH THE PLANNING COMMISSION AND STAFF TO MAKE THESE DUPLEXES INSTEAD OF SINGLE-FAMILY HOMESITES, MUCH MORE AFFORDABLE HOMESITES IN THE AREA. SO, AS PART OF THAT, WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH STAFF FOR A COUPLE THREE YEARS NOW TO TRY TO GET THIS SITE TO ACCOMMODATE DUPLEXES VERSUS SINGLE-FAMILY HOME SITES, SO THE PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU RIGHT NOW IS FOR 17 INDIVIDUAL BUILDINGS IN VIRTUALLY THE SAME LOCATION OF THE ORIGINAL SINGLE-FAMILY HOME SITES, AND ONE SINGLE-FAMILY HOME SITE THAT'S ALREADY FINISHED ON SITE, AND TO CHANGE THOSE BUILDINGS INTO DUPLEXES INSTEAD OF SINGLE-FAMILY HOME SITES. AND AS YOU CAN SEE, IT'S VIRTUAL A SINGLE-FAMILY HOME LOOK WITH TWO DOORS IN IT INSTEAD OF ONE DOOR IN THE FRONT OF THE STRUCTURE, AND EACH UNIT IS GOING TO HAVE A TWO-CAR GARAGE, AN ENCLOSED TWO-CAR GARAGE, SO ALL OF THE INDIVIDUAL HOME SITES WILL HAVE THEIR AUTOMOBILES INSIDE THE STRUCTURES, AND THEN WILL HAVE INDIVIDUAL DRIVES LEADING UP TO EACH OF THE HOME SITES. SO, THERE ARE TWO DRIVEWAYS LEADING UP TO EACH OF THE HOME SITES THEMSELVES. WE HAVE, AS I SAID, WE HAVE WORKED VERY HARD WITH STAFF, AND I WANT TO PERSONALLY THANK AND TELL YOU THAT MR. JEFF KAHAN AND AMY ARE PROFESSIONALS IN EVERY SENSE OF THE WORD. THEY SEE PROBLEMS WITH SITES, THEY LET US KNOW ABOUT IT AHEAD OF TIME, AND THEY WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DOT OUR Is AND CROSS OUR Ts TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PRESENT A NICE PROJECT TO YOU PLANNING COMMISSIONERS. SO THE REQUEST NOW IS TO ALLOW FOR A LITTLE MORE DENSE DEVELOPMENT IN THAT THE NUMBER OF UNITS AREN'T  -- ARE CHANGING BUT THE NUMBER OF STRUCTURES ARE STAYING EXACTLY THE SAME. THERE ARE A COUPLE OF ITEMS I WOULD LIKE TO LET THE PLANNING COMMISSION KNOW, BECAUSE IN DOING THIS KIND OF WORK AROUND THE STATE, NOT MUCH CHANGES IN THE CONCERNS OF THE NEIGHBORING COMMUNITY AND THE PLANNING COMMISSIONS. NOT THE LEAST OF WHICH, AND I APOLOGIZE AS WELL, IN THAT THAT I'M A CRAZY BOARD MEMBER IN WHITELAKE TOWNSHIP, SO I GET TO HEAR THE CONCERNS OF DEVELOPMENT IN MY OWN COMMUNITY, SO TRAFFIC IS A MAJOR ISSUE, AND I HAVE A REVISED TRAFFIC STUDY, AND I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE THAT THE REVISED TRAFFIC STUDY IS BEFORE YOU. I KNOW ONE WAS SUBMITTED, BUT AS OF THE SINGLE-FAMILY HOME SITE WITH 18 UNITS PROPOSED ENDED UP WITH 215 TRAFFIC INCIDENCES OR TRAFFIC -- I'M SORRY, I'M TRYING TO GET THERE -- THE ACTUAL TRAFFIC COUNT FOR SINGLE-FAMILY HOMES, WHEN IT WAS RE-EVALUATED BY A PROFESSIONAL TRAFFIC ENGINEER, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TRAFFIC COUNT IN SINGLE-FAMILY HOME SITES AND MULTIPLE-FAMILY UNITS, THE INCREASE ONLY RAISED BY 16 TRAFFIC COUNTS, GOING FROM THE SINGLE-FAMILY HOME SITE TO THE MULTIPLE FAMILY. THE CHURCH AND -- AND OTHER TRAFFIC ANALYSIS SHOW THAT THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE DIFFERENCE IN THE USE OF THOSE HOMES. YOU DON'T HAVE A FAMILY OF FOUR, FIVE, AND SIX IN THE HOME SITE. YOU DON'T HAVE A NUMBER OF TRIPS BACK AND FORTH TO SCHOOL. TYPICALLY, THEY ARE OCCUPIED BY ONE AND TWO-MEMBER FAMILIES AND NOT LARGER FAMILIES IN THE MULTIPLE. SO, A TOTAL OF 16 ADDITIONAL TRIPS ONLY BY CHANGING FROM SINGLE-FAMILY TO MULTIPLE, AND ONLY FOUR ADDITIONAL TRIPS DURING PEAK TIMES, MORNING AND EVENING, SO ONLY A FOUR ADDITIONAL TRIPS. SO, THE CONCERN FROM THE NEIGHBORS ARE SOMEWHAT ALLEVIATED BECAUSE OF THE DIFFERENT TYPE OF OCCUPANT THAT WILL BE IN THE MULTIPLE-FAMILY DEVELOPMENT. WE HAVE SANITARY SEWERS ALREADY EXTENDED INTO THE SITE FROM THE PREVIOUS PROJECT. WATER MAIN IS ALREADY INSTALLED IN THE DEVELOPMENT, AND THE SANITARY -- I MEAN THE STORM SEWER STORM WILL BE UPGRADED TO ACCOMMODATE ALL OF THE ROADWAYS, AS THEY CURRENTLY ARE, AND THEY HAD TO BE MODIFIED MEETING THE FIRE DEPARTMENT'S REQUIREMENTS. STORMWATER FLOWS FROM THE NORTH SIDE TO THE SOUTH SIDE IN A PARALLEL STORM SEWER SYSTEM, PICKING UP THE STORM WATER COMING OUT OF THE SITE FROM THE SURROUNDING AREA, AS WELL AS DOWN THE STREETS. IT GOES INTO A FORE BAY, A DETENTION BASIN, AND OUTLETS INTO A CONTROL CREEK THAT FOLLOWS ALONG THE WESTERLY SIDE OF THE DEVELOPMENT. JEFF, IS THERE A -- CAN YOU CHANGE THAT --
00:13:46.166: >> IF YOU HAVE THE KEYBOARD THERE, IF YOU HIT THE RETURN, THE RETURN SHOULD ADVANCE IT.
00:13:50.337: >> THE RETURN OR THE ENTER?
00:13:52.339: >> ENTER I GUESS IT'S CALLED.
00:13:53.440: >> OH, LOOK AT THAT. ALL RIGHT. SO, THIS SHOWS THE LOCATION. IT'S ALONG THE SOUTHERLY SIDE OF TRAVER DRIVE. THIS IS STRICTLY A RESIDENTIAL TYPE ROADWAY. THIS WHOLE AREA IS CURRENTLY ZONED MULTIPLE, AND THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF MULTIPLE ALREADY EXISTING IN THIS AREA. THE PICTURE ALONG THE BOTTOM PORTION OF THAT SCREEN IS THE -- IS REALLY FROM THE RAILROAD TRACKS, THE OUTLET UNDERNEATH THE RAILROAD TRACKS, AND THE OWNER HAS STEPPED IN AND CLEANED UP ALL OF THOSE BASKETS AND CREATED A VERY NICE AND A VERY EFFICIENT MANNER TO CARRY THE WATER FROM UNDERNEATH THE RAILROAD TRACKS DOWN TO THE STREAM OR CREEK TO THE WEST. SO, THE CURRENT PROPOSAL, AS I SAID, IS TO CHANGE THE SINGLE-FAMILY HOMES TO DUPLEXES. WE HAD TO LOSE ONE OF THE DUPLEX UNITS, BECAUSE IN WORKING WITH THE FIRE DEPARTMENT, THEY NEEDED TO HAVE A TURNAROUND AT THE END FOR THEIR FIRE TRUCKS, AND SO WE HAVE ACCOMMODATED A TURNAROUND FOR THE FIRE DEPARTMENT, AS WELL AS IN FIGHTING THE FIRES, IF SOMETHING WERE TO HAPPEN BACK THERE, THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE PROJECT WILL BE SPRINKLERED. ALL OF THE HOMES IN THE SOUTHERN PORTION OF THE DEVELOPMENT WILL BE SPRINKLERED, FIRE-SUPPRESSED, SO THE FIRE DEPARTMENT HAS -- THEIR HOPE IS THE FIRE WILL BE OUT BEFORE THEY EVEN ARRIVE ON SITE. SO, ALL OF THAT WAS DONE TO ACCOMMODATE THE FIRE DEPARTMENT'S CONCERNS. WE ALSO HAD AN INTERESTING CHORE, BECAUSE, BELIEVE IT OR NOT, AND I KNOW YOU DIDN'T HAVE ANY HAND IN THIS AT ALL, YOUR ORDINANCES HAVE CHANGED OVER THE YEARS, AND SO TO ALLOW THIS SITE TO ACCOMMODATE THE BALANCE OF -- OR TO THE -- TO NEW ORDINANCES, WE HAD TO ACCOMMODATE IT BY WIDENING THE DRIVES FROM THE ORIGINAL SITE, SO WE WIDENED THE DRIVEWAYS AND FIRE HYDRANTS. AS I SAID, WE HAVE SPRINKLERED THE BUILDINGS. WE HAVE MODIFIED HOW EACH BUILDING WAS GOING TO BE SERVED WITH SANITARY AND WATER, AND SO WE HAVE WORKED VERY CAREFULLY WITH STAFF TO MODIFY EVEN THE DUMPSTER AREA AND RECONFIGURED THAT AND WE ARE GOING TO REBUILD THOSE WALLS AROUND THAT. WE HAVE ADDED BICYCLE RACKS ON SITE. MOST OF THE INDIVIDUAL BICYCLE RACKS WILL BE IN THE BUILDINGS, BUT WE HAVE A CLASS A BICYCLE RACK OUT IN FRONT TO WHERE ANYBODY CAN KEEP THEIR BIKES THERE AS WELL. SO I'LL BE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS YOU HAVE, AND I'M -- JUST ONE OTHER VERY QUICK NOTE, YOUR NOTES SAY THAT THE OWNER HAS REQUESTED THAT THIS BE POSTPONED. THEY DIDN'T BELIEVE THAT THEY COULD HAVE ANYONE HERE TO REPRESENT THEM, SO I'M HERE REPRESENTING THEM, AND IF THE PLANNING COMMISSION SO DESIRES, AND I HAVE ANSWERED ALL OF YOUR QUESTIONS AND THIS GOES PROPERLY, WE WOULD APPRECIATE A RECOMMENDATION TO CITY COUNCIL TONIGHT, IF IT'S YOUR PLEASURE. SO, THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN.
00:17:18.444: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  THANK YOU. WE'LL NOW HEAD TO MR. KAHAN FOR A STAFF REPORT.
00:17:22.315: >> THANK YOU. JUST A LITTLE BIT OF HISTORY, FIRST, IN THE MID '60s, A NINE-UNIT TOWN HOME PROJECT WAS CONSTRUCTED ON THE SITE, WHICH STILL EXISTS TODAY. IN 2003, ANOTHER DEVELOPER RECEIVED APPROVAL TO CONSTRUCT THE SINGLE-FAMILY HOMES ON THE SITE, BUT ONLY ONE OF THOSE HOMES WAS CONSTRUCTED. ANOTHER HOME REMAINS UNFINISHED ON THE SITE, AND TWO BASEMENTS WERE CONSTRUCTED WITHOUT ANY OTHER IMPROVEMENTS. THE CURRENT DEVELOPMENT TEAM ACQUIRED THE PROPERTY FAIRLY RECENTLY AND CAME UP WITH THIS NEW CONCEPT OF PROPOSING DUPLEXES WHERE PREVIOUSLY SINGLE-FAMILY HOME SITES WERE SHOWN, SO THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A HISTORY. I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT AT THAT TIME, IN THE MID-2000s, WHEN THE INITIAL DEVELOPMENT TEAM WAS ATTEMPTING TO CONSTRUCT THE HOMES, A NUMBER OF NATURAL FEATURES WERE REMOVED AT THE SITE, AND ARE IN THE PROCESS OF BEING REPLACED. THERE WERE TWO MITIGATED WETLANDS THAT WERE CONSTRUCTED AT THAT TIME THAT ARE NOT IN GREAT SHAPE, SO WE HAVE ASKED THE CURRENT DEVELOPERS TO IMPROVE THEM, WHICH THEY HAVE AGREED TO DO. THERE ARE TWO OTHER WETLANDS ON THE SITE FOR A TOTAL OF FOUR. THE STAFF REPORT DOES INCLUDE A DISCUSSION ON TREE REPLACEMENT, AND THE PETITIONER HAS AGREED TO PROVIDE ALL OF THE NECESSARY REPLACEMENT TREES. THE PETITIONER HAS ALSO AGREED TO DEDICATE FUNDS FOR PARK IMPROVEMENTS NEARBY, AND AT THIS POINT, BECAUSE THE PETITIONER HAD REQUESTED POSTPONEMENT, STAFF IS RECOMMENDING THE PROJECT SITE PLAN BE POSTPONED. IF THE PLANNING COMMISSION HAS ALL OF ITS QUESTIONS ANSWERED AND FEEL THAT THIS PETITION CAN MOVE FORWARD TO CITY COUNCIL, THEN THEY CAN -- THEN THE COMMISSION CAN MOVE THAT.
00:19:45.191: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  THANK YOU. AT THIS TIME, I WOULD LIKE TO OPEN UP A PUBLIC HEARING ON THIS ITEM. IF THERE IS ANYBODY IN THE AUDIENCE WHO WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION, PLEASE STEP UP TO THE PODIUM AND STAYED YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS FOR THE RECORD AND YOU'LL HAVE UP TO THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
00:20:01.641: >> MY NAME IS PATRICIA HALL. I WOULD LIKE TO READ THE COMMENTS OF MY NEIGHBOR AT 2000 TRAVER ROAD. AND HE SAYS, I AM OPPOSED TO THIS PROJECT FOR SEVERAL REASONS. THE DEVELOPERS HAVE NOT DEMONSTRATED THEMSELVES TO BE RESPONSIBLE NOR RESPECTFUL NEIGHBORS. CURRENTLY, THERE IS ONE HOUSE HALF CONSTRUCTED ON THE LOT AND TWO OPEN FOUNDATIONS. THESE FOUNDATIONS HAVE BEEN OPEN WITHOUT ANY SAFETY PRECAUTIONS, SUCH AS A FENCE OR A RAIL, FOR OVER THREE YEARS. I HAVE EXPRESSED MY CONCERN REGARDING THE SAFETY OF THESE OPEN FOUNDATIONS IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD WITH CHILDREN AND PETS BUT HAVE RECEIVED NO RESPONSE. THE DEVELOPER TURNED OUR ONCE BEAUTIFUL BACKYARD WITH TREES AND A PICNIC AREA INTO AN UNKEMPT WETLAND THAT THEY REFUSE TO MAINTAIN. WHEN I EXPRESSED CONCERNS IN THE AREA, SPECIFICALLY ABOUT STANDING WATER AND THE MOSQUITOES I WAS TOLD THAT I SHOULD GET USED TO IT BECAUSE THAT IS HOW THE LAND WILL REMAIN. THREE, OUR AREA HAS ALREADY EXPERIENCED PROBLEMS WITH PARKING. INCREASING THE TOTAL NUMBER OF DWELLINGS FROM 29 TO 45 WOULD PUT UNDUE STRESS ON OUR PARKING. AS THE CONSTRUCTED HOUSE DEMONSTRATES, ONLY ONE UNIT WITHIN THESE PROPOSED DUPLEX DEVELOPMENTS WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO A GARAGE. AND, FINALLY, AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF TOTAL DWELLINGS WOULD LEAD TO TRAFFIC PROBLEMS, SOMETHING I'M ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT. AS THERE IS CURRENTLY ONLY ONE DRIVEWAY FROM TRAVER ROAD WITH ACCESS TO THE DEVELOPMENT. AS STATED BY A MEMBER OF THE PREVIOUS PLANNING COMMISSION WITH THESE DEVELOPERS, AN INCREASE IN CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT POSES A SAFETY RISK TO THE CHILDREN IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. THE DEVELOPERS STATED THEY SHARED THIS CONCERN AND WOULD MEET WITH PARENTS TO ENSURE SAFETY. SUCH A MEETING NEVER TOOK PLACE, AND NO MEASURES TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD CHILDREN WERE TAKEN. WHAT WILL BE THE DIFFERENCE THIS TIME? THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION, ZACHARY HUT HUTTINGER.
00:22:23.749: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  THANK YOU.
00:22:28.087: >> MY NAME IS DAVID FAVOR. I LIVE AT 1791 HIDEAWAY LANE, AND REGARDING THE EXISTING STRUCTURE, THE PARTIALLY BUILT HOUSE, IT IS, AS FAR AS WE CAN TELL, ONLY FRAMED OUT. THERE IS NO DRYWALL INSIDE. IT'S NOT READY TO MOVE IN. THE WINDOWS ARE PERIODICALLY OPEN TO THE ELEMENTS FOR WEEKS AT A TIME DURING RAIN AND SNOW, AND THE TWO OPEN FOUNDATIONS A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO WERE MODIFIED TO PRESUMABLY ACCOMMODATE THE PROPOSED DUPLEXES. THEY HAD CINDER BLOCK WALLS INSERTED, AND IN THE PROCESS OF THIS, THE FOUNDATIONS THEMSELVES WERE DAMAGED, SO WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE QUALITY OF THE BUILDINGS THAT ARE GOING TO BE GOING IN ON THE EXISTING PIECES.
00:23:24.277: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  THANK YOU.
00:23:30.683: >> IT SEEMS LIKE WE HAVE A GOOD REPRESENTATION FROM HIDEAWAY LANE. I AM CRAIG WAGNER AT 1793 HIDEAWAY LANE. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU, AND I APPRECIATE THIS FORUM FOR YOU TO LISTEN TO US. AND I URGE YOU NOT TO APPROVE THE NEW PROPOSAL. THREE PRIMARY REASONS, TWO SPECIFIC TO THE SITE, AND ONE LARGER FROM A DEVELOPMENT PERSPECTIVE IN ANN ARBOR. WE HAVE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT TRAFFIC. THAT IS NUMBER ONE. WITH 16 NEW DWELLINGS ON THE SITE, THAT WILL DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF CARS ON THAT SITE, AND IF WE ARE ASSUMING THAT THERE WILL BE BETWEEN ONE AND TWO CARS FOR EACH OF THE DWELLINGS, THAT'S 16-32 CARS ADDITIONALLY THAT WILL BE COMING AND GOING, AND WHEREAS 16-32 CARS IN ANN ARBOR, YOU KNOW, THAT'S A DROP IN THE BUCKET, OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE MANY DECISIONS ON EXPANDING DEVELOPMENT, BUT CERTAINLY IN THAT AREA, WHERE THERE'S ONLY ONE PAVED ROAD OUT TO GREATER ANN ARBOR, WE ARE GOING TO CERTAINLY SEE GREATER TRAFFIC THERE. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WAS INTERESTED IN SEEING WAS THE NEW SITE PROPOSAL, AND THIS GOES TO MY POINT NUMBER TWO, AND THAT IS GREEN SPACE. AS I EXPECTED, TO KEEP THE NUMBER OF DWELLINGS AND DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF -- OR KEEP THE NUMBER OF BUILDINGS BUT DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF DWELLINGS, THE DWELLINGS HAVE TO BE BIGGER, AND CERTAINLY COMPARING THE TWO BEFORE AND AFTER, THE DWELLINGS ARE MUCH LARGER, AND YOU CAN, I THINK, TAKE A LOOK. ME EYEBALLING IT FROM 50 FEET, IT LOOKS LIKE 30-40% GREATER SQUARE FOOTAGE ON THE BUILDINGS AND ALSO LESS GREEN SPACE. I'M GUESSING IT LOOKS LIKE, IF YOU -- YOU KNOW, IF YOU LOOK AT ALL OF THE GREEN SPACE ON THAT FOUR ACRES, I'M GUESSING IT'S ABOUT CUT IN HALF, BUT, YOU KNOW, YOU CERTAINLY CAN MAKE THAT CALCULATION. FROM THE SITE PLAN. AND, LASTLY, I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO THIS IN THE LARGER ANN ARBOR PERSPECTIVE, BECAUSE I KNOW YOU HAVE AN INTEREST IN MANAGING THE NEW DEVELOPMENT THAT COMES INTO THIS CITY, AND IT'S HARD TO ARGUE WITH THE FACT THAT, YOU KNOW, MORE HOUSING BRINGS IN MORE TAX REVENUES, BRINGS MORE PEOPLE IN TO OUR FAIR CITY, WHICH IS WONDERFUL, BUT THERE IS ALSO A LOT OF HIDDEN COSTS THAT WE OFTEN DON'T CONSIDER. THAT IS IN TERMS OF INCREASED TRAFFIC, GREATER STRESS ON THE CITY INFRASTRUCTURE, REDUCTION IN GREEN SPACE, GREATER NOISE AND LIGHT POLLUTION, AND MORE CROWDING ON OUR STREETS, AND THESE ALL CONTRIBUTE IN A MINOR WAY TO DEGRADING THE CHARACTER OF THE CITY THAT WE LOVE, AND THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE, GIVEN THAT WE ARE IN THE UNIQUE POSITION OF HAVING A WONDERFUL UNIVERSITY THAT ALSO WAS PUTTING SIGNIFICANT PRESSURE -- OH, IS THAT IT? SO, SO I URGE YOU NOT TO APPROVE THE PROPOSAL. THANK YOU.
00:26:44.343: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  THANK YOU.
00:26:50.382: >> I'LL JUST PUT THIS HERE. OKAY. SO, I'M GOING TO READ OFF MY IPhone, JUST TO KEEP MY COMMENTS EFFICIENT. MY NAME IS JOSEPH PRATT. I LIVE PART-TIME AT 1790 HIDEAWAY LANE AND THE OTHER PART OF THE TIME AT 3092 OVEREEN DRIVE OVER IN COLONIAL SQUARE. I WANT TO COMMENT ON WHAT I OBSERVE AS THE RESPONSIBILITY OR IRRESPONSIBILITY OF THE DEVELOPERS. YOU HAVE HEARD COMMENTS ABOUT THE OPEN FOUNDATIONS, THIS DERELICT HOUSE THAT THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING ON OFF AND ON FOR FOUR YEARS THAT IS TRASHED BY THE WEATHER. IT'S SOMETIMES LEFT OPEN. THERE'S ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE LIVING IN THERE, AND ANIMALS TOO, SOMETIMES, SO IT KIND OF CONCERNS ME THAT THIS KIND OF IRRESPONSIBILITY IS GOING ON, AND NOW THEY ARE PROPOSING THIS DEVELOPMENT, AND MY BIGGEST QUESTION IS THE DRAINAGE. OKAY. THE CITY SPENT MILLIONS OF DOLLARS DEVELOPING THE DRAINAGE ON LESLIE GOLF COURSE A FEW YEARS AGO, AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU WOULD WANT TO PRESERVE THAT INVESTMENT. WELL, THIS AREA THAT THE PROPOSED HIDEAWAY LANE DEVELOPMENT IS GOING IN ON IS SOGGY ALL THE TIME. CLEARLY, IT HAS DRAINAGE PROBLEMS. WHEN WE HAVE ONE OF THESE HARD RAINSTORMS, THE GROUND CAN BE SOGGY FOR SEVERAL DAYS. MY QUESTION IS, BUILD THIS THING, AND WHERE'S ALL OF THE WATER GOING TO GO? SO, YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT THE EMPTY FOUNDATIONS, THE DERELICT HOUSE. THE CITY HAS SPENT MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON THE WATERSHED, DEVELOPING THE WATERSHED FOR LESLIE PARK GOLF COURSE. WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO SCREW THAT UP? I'M CONCERNED THAT THIS HIDEAWAY LANE DEVELOPMENT WOULD POTENTIALLY ALTER THE WATER DYNAMICS IN THE AREA. IT IS NOT FAIR TO TAXPAYERS, ESPECIALLY TO THOSE WHO OWN STRUCTURES IN THE AREA THAT COULD BE POTENTIALLY NEGATIVELY AFFECTED -- EXCUSE ME -- BY THE WATER BACKUPS. CURRENTLY, THE WATER DOES NOT DRAIN EASILY. AFTER A HEAVY RAIN, THE AREA IS OFTEN SOGGY FOR SEVERAL DAYS, WITH A BUILD OF THE DEVELOPMENT, I FEAR THAT THERE WILL NOT BE A GOOD WAY FOR THE WATER TO DRAIN. THE SITE HAS CONSIDERABLE MARSHLAND AREA. IT WILL BE FAIR -- WILL IT BE FAIR TO BUILD HOUSES ON AN AREA THAT WILL CAUSE PROBLEMS FOR THE BUYERS OF THOSE UNITS? ADDITIONALLY, THOSE OF US WHO LIVE NEARBY COULD ALSO ENCOUNTER DRAINAGE PROBLEMS. THAT IS NOT FAIR. IF A PROBLEM OCCURS. AND YOU DON'T KNOW IF A PROBLEM OCCURS. MR. POWELL IS SAYING, OH, YEAH, WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT, BUT HE TOLD ME JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO, WELL, THIS IS A TOUGH AREA, SO, YOU KNOW, I'M KIND OF GUESSING THEY ARE NOT SURE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. SO MY CONCERN IS THERE IS A PROBLEM. IT'S SEEMING LIKE TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE. THEY ARE COMING IN, SAYING, OH, YEAH, WE ARE GOING TO FIX THIS, TREAT THAT. I THINK IT'S JUST A WET AREA. SO, ANYWAY, THAT'S MY STATEMENT. THANK YOU.
00:29:59.004: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION IN REGARDS TO THIS PETITION? SEEING NO ONE, I WILL READ THE MOTION. THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION HEREBY RECOMMENDS APPROVE THE HIDEAWAY LANE PLANNED PROJECT SITE PLAN AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT. MOVED BY COMMISSIONER MILLS AND SECOND BY COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN. WE ARE IN DISCUSSION. BEFORE I HAND IT OFF TO SOMEBODY, SO, FOR AS LONG AS WE HAVE HAD THE PACKET, WHICH IS SINCE LAST WEEK, THERE HAS BEEN A STAFF RECOMMENDATION FOR POSTPONEMENT IN THE PETITIONER'S REQUEST FOR A POSTPONEMENT, SO MY FEAR IN HAVING A DEEP DISCUSSION THIS EVENING IS THAT WE AREN'T ACTUALLY GETTING THE FULL PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS ITEM, SO I AM -- I WILL -- OF COURSE I'LL LISTEN TO WHAT EVERYBODY HAS TO SAY, BUT I DO ENCOURAGE THIS BODY TO VOTE FOR A POSTPONEMENT SO THAT WE CAN GATHER ADDITIONAL FEEDBACK. AND I WILL HAND IT OFF TO COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN.
00:31:14.446: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN:  THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR. I HAD LISTED EIGHT THINGS THAT I WANTED TO CHECK IN ON, BUT I DO APPRECIATE -- I DON'T KNOW IF MORE NEIGHBORS WOULD COME. I DON'T KNOW IF NEIGHBORS WERE DETERRED BY THE RECOMMENDATION FOR POSTPONEMENT, AND SO I WOULD ALSO HEAR THE BENEFIT OF POSTPONING NOW AND GETTING, YOU KNOW, THEIR INPUT, SO I GUESS I'LL HOLD OFF AND SEE IF THAT'S OF INTEREST NOW. IF WE ARE TO POSTPONE, I DO WANT TO JUST ASK ONE THING OF THE DEVELOPER, SO I GUESS --
00:31:47.613: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  I GUESS TAKE A QUICK POLL. ARE WE OKAY WITH HAVING A LIGHT DISCUSSION AND THEN MOVING ON TO POSTPONEMENT?
00:31:56.622: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN:  AS A POINT OF ORDER, I DON'T KNOW IF WE CAN TAKE A POLL.
00:32:00.359: >> I DIDN'T PREPARE IN THE WAY THAT I NORMALLY WOULD, BECAUSE I SAW THIS WAS BEING POSTPONED, AND THIS HAS GOT A LOT OF COMPLEXITY TO IT, SO I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO POSTPONE. HOWEVER, I DO THINK THAT BRINGING UP A FEW ITEMS THAT THEY CAN THEN ADDRESS THE NEXT TIME AROUND WOULD BE GREAT. SO IF THERE'S A FEW KIND OF BULLET LIST TYPE THINGS THAT WE CAN GIVE TO THE DEVELOPER, I'M TOTALLY IN FAVOR OF THAT, BUT I PERSONALLY DON'T FEEL READY TO REVIEW THIS, BECAUSE I JUST DIDN'T DO MY NORMAL DUE DILIGENCE ON IT, BECAUSE I SAW IT WAS RECOMMENDED TO POSTPONE.
00:32:33.559: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  OKAY. COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN, LET'S START WITH THE LIST.
00:32:36.662: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN: THANKS, MR. CHAIR. WITH RESPECT TO THE FENCING, I UNDERSTAND YOU DIDN'T ACQUIRE THE PROPERTY THAT LONG AGO, AND IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE HAS BEEN A SORDID HISTORY OF DIFFERENT PROPERTY OWNERS. I APPRECIATE THAT. IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY NOW, AND SO WHILE THIS IS BEFORE THIS BODY, IF YOU COULD TAKE BACK TO THE OWNER TO GET THIS FENCED OFF, WHILE THIS IS GOING THROUGH PROCESS, I THINK IT WOULD MEAN A LOT TO THE NEIGHBORS AND CERTAINLY A LOT TO CITY HALL, SO IF THERE COULD BE SOME KIND OF PROTECTIVE FENCING WHILE IT'S GOING THROUGH PROCESS, I THINK THAT WOULD BE GOOD.
00:33:10.996: >> YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AROUND THE OPEN --
00:33:14.399: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN:  YES.
00:33:16.235: >> THANK YOU.
00:33:16.602: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN:  SO AT THE VERY LEAST, SOME CHANGE THERE WOULD BE GREAT IMMEDIATELY. AND IN TERMS OF SOME OF THE OTHER ITEMS THAT I WANTED TO TOUCH ON, WITH RESPECT TO STORMWATER, THERE ISN'T A LOT IN OUR STAFF REPORT. GETTING SOME COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THE AFFECTS OF THIS DEVELOPMENT WILL BE ON THE MOVEMENT OF WATER AND WHAT YOU'RE DOING TO MITIGATE THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. INFORMATION ON THE CHANGES IN TRIP GENERATION FROM A TRAFFIC PERSPECTIVE, YOU MENTIONED 16 INCREASED TRIPS BUT DIDN'T MENTION THE UNIT OR DURING WHAT TIME SPAN OF THE DAY. ON PARKING, I DID HEAR THE RESIDENTS, ALTHOUGH IT SEEMS LIKE THE SITE IS OVERPARKED WITH THREE PARKING SPACES PER UNIT, WHICH IS A FAIR AMOUNT, ON THE BUILDING QUALITY, I'LL PROBABLY WANT TO LOOK TO STAFF ON ASSURANCES THAT OUR PERMITTING PROCESS AND INSPECTION PROCESS IS GOING TO ENSURE THAT ANYTHING BUILT IN THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR IS SAFE AND SECURE FOR ITS RESIDENTS. ON THE SIZE OF THE BUILDINGS AND THE CHANGES TO GREEN SPACE, IT WOULD BE GREAT TO GET A COMPARISON, NOT JUST VISUALLY BUT IN TERMS OF DIMENSIONS TO ANY CHANGES ON THE BUILDING ENVELOPES AS WELL AND THE IMPACTS TO GREEN SPACE.
00:34:28.874: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN: COMMISSIONER BRIGGS?
00:34:30.042: >> COMISSIONER BRIGGS:  THAT TOUCHED ON MOST OF THE CONCERNS THAT I HAD AS WELL. THE ONLY OTHER ONE THAT I WOULD SUGGEST THAT IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE IS OPPORTUNITY FOR ANOTHER -- FOR A PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT MEETING, IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE IS A REQUEST FROM FOLKS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD WHO ARE EXISTING THERE TO DEAL WITH WHAT CONSTRUCTION IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE AND MEETING REQUESTS THAT HAVE NOT NECESSARILY BEEN FULFILLED, SO IT WOULD BE NICE TO SEE THAT THAT IS MOVING FORWARD IN SOME CITIZEN INPUT AND SOME KIND OF NEIGHBORHOOD INPUT IS HAPPENING PRODUCTIVELY.
00:35:05.244: >> I APPRECIATE THAT.
00:35:06.378: >> COMISSIONER BRIGGS:  AND I WOULD BE INTERESTED TO HEAR JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY OF THE HOUSES THAT GOT RAISED A FEW TIMES, IF YOU COULD SPEAK TO HOW THE CITY SORT OF ADDRESSES ISSUES LIKE THAT THAT MAY SORT OF BE -- IT SOUNDS LIKE SOME OF THOSE THINGS MIGHT BE AHEAD OF TIME --
00:35:24.630: >> IT COULD BE SOMETHING THAT THE BUILDING OFFICIALS WILL FOLLOW UP ON. I ASSUME THAT JEFF WILL TAKE NOTE OF THAT. I'M NOT AWARE OF THAT HISTORY OFF-HAND, BUT, YEAH, IF THEY ARE DANGEROUS AND FALLING IN, THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT, AND THAT WOULD ALSO BE INSPECTED BEFORE THE PROJECT WAS ALLOWED TO GO FORWARD, IF IT WAS APPROVED IN ANY WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM BEFORE ANY CONSTRUCTION STARTS ON THAT FOUNDATION, IT WILL BE INSPECTED, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF THE LENGTH OF TIME IT'S BEEN IN THE GROUND.
00:35:50.722: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN: COMMISSIONER MILLS?
00:35:53.191: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  I THINK WHEN WE GET THE STAFF REPORT NEXT TIME, TOO, KIND OF UNDERSTANDING A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE NECESSITY FOR THE PLANNED PROJECT MODIFICATION, AND I ASSUME THAT WHEN THE PETITIONER TALKED ABOUT CHANGES THAT HAPPENED IN ZONING SINCE THEN THAT THAT WAS WHAT WAS BEING REFERRED TO POTENTIALLY, BUT KIND OF UNDERSTANDING A LITTLE BIT BETTER WHERE THAT IS AND HOW THAT CAME TO BE, WHERE IT IS THAT IT'S CLOSER TO, IT SOUNDS LIKE, THE EAST PROPERTY LINE THAN ALLOWED BY CODE, HOW THAT CAME TO BE. I'LL JUST ASSERT SINCE PARTICULARLY WE ARE MOVING TO DUPLEXES NOW AND IT'S THE REQUIREMENT, IS 30 AND IT'S ASKING FOR 20, YES, THERE IS A BIGGER SET BACK ON THE OTHER SIDE. LIKE, THERE'S LOTS OF OTHER THINGS THAT CAN BE PART OF A PLAN PROJECT THAT HELPS MEET THAT QUALIFICATION, AND SO I THINK WE SHOULD BE CONSIDERING THAT, KNOWING WHAT'S ON THAT LIST.
00:36:59.291: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN: COMMISSIONER WOODS.
00:37:03.695: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS:  JUST A QUESTION ABOUT THE EASEMENT IN THE BACK, WHICH THE REAR SETBACK IS GOING TO ABUT THE RAILROAD TRACK, SO I WOULD LIKE TO SEE HOW THAT'S GOING TO BE FENCED AND HOW YOU'RE GOING TO KEEP CHILDREN AND OTHERS SAFE, IF, INDEED, THAT'S GOING TO BE PRETTY CLOSE TO FOLKS' PROPERTY.
00:37:28.186: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN: COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN.
00:37:29.187: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN:  THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR. I'M GOING TO MOVE TO POSTPONE, BUT ALSO JUST TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH OUR ETHICS RULES, I SAID IT WOULD MEAN A LOT TO THE CITY HALL AND NEIGHBORS TO GET FENCING. I CAN'T SPEAK TO CITY HALL. IT WOULD MEAN A LOT TO THIS COMMISSIONER AND CITY COUNCIL.
00:37:46.638: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  DO WE HAVE A SECOND? COMMISSIONER MILLS. ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION ON THE POSTPONEMENT? COMMISSIONER WOODS.
00:37:53.145: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS:  DID YOU WANT TO POSTPONE IT TO A DATE CERTAIN? YOU SAID JULY 19TH?
00:38:00.185: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN:  NEXT MEETING IS WHAT I SAID.
00:38:02.454: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  I THINK WE ASKED A LOT OF QUESTIONS, SO I THINK IT WOULD BE BEST TO LET MR. KAHAN AND THE PETITIONER.
00:38:09.094: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS:  THAT WAS GOING TO BE MY SUGGESTION, BUT I DIDN'T HEAR WHAT YOU SAID.
00:38:13.098: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN:  I SAID THE NEXT MEETING OR WHATEVER MAKES MORE SENSE, SO IF I COULD AMEND TO A FRIENDLY DATE UNCERTAIN.
00:38:21.173: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS:  ALL RIGHT.
00:38:22.107: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  FURTHER DISCUSSION ON THE POSTPONEMENT, ALL THOSE IN FAVOR, PLEASE SAY AYE. [ CHORUS OF AYES ] IT IS POSTPONED.
00:38:28.413: >> THANK YOU, COMMISSIONERS, VERY MUCH.
00:38:31.016: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  THANK YOU. MOVING ON TO VIC VILLAGE SOUTH SITE PLAN FOR CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL, AND WE WILL BEGIN WITH PETITIONER'S PRESENTATION. THEY WILL HAVE UP TO TEN MINUTES TO PRESENT THEIR PROJECT. WE WILL THEN OPEN IT UP TO -- OR THEN WE'LL GO TO A STAFF REPORT FOLLOWED BY A PUBLIC HEARING AND THEN DISCUSSION.
00:38:54.105: >> OKAY. HOLD ON ONE SECOND.
00:39:01.046: >> YOU TOLD ME TO HIT ESCAPE. YOU DIDN'T TELL ME ANYTHING AFTER THAT. YOU DIDN'T TELL ME TO GO TO THAT PART.
00:39:06.651: >> THESE ARE JUST GOING TO BE THE GENERAL PLANS, SO YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO KIND OF SCROLL THROUGH.
00:39:11.690: >> IT WILL START AT THE END.
00:39:14.426: >> OKAY.
00:39:25.470: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  FULL SCREEN MODE. GOOD EVENING. MY NAME IS SHAUN. I'M A DEVELOPER WITH VIC VILLAGE SOUTH. I HAVE RON HUGHES, WHO IS WITH US TODAY AS WELL, ONE OF THE PRINCIPALS AT HUGHES PROPERTIES. WE HAVE -- AND TOM COVERT AND TED HERSH WITH MCI, WHO ARE CIVIL ENGINEERS. WE ARE PROPOSING TODAY A 13-STORY APARTMENT COMPLEX LOCATED AT THE CORNER OF EAST UNIVERSITY AND SOUTH UNIVERSITY. WE HAVE GONE THROUGH DESIGN REVIEW BOARD. WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED A LOT OF THE CHANGES THAT THE DESIGN REVIEW BOARD CAME BACK TO US WITH, PRIMARILY AS IT RELATED TO THIS CORNER. WE HAVE ALSO WORKED VERY DILIGENTLY WITH ALL OF THE VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS WITHIN THE CITY AND HAVE ADDRESSED ALL OF THEIR CONCERNS, I BELIEVE TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITY AND WHAT THEY WERE LOOKING FOR AS WELL, AND WITH THAT, I'LL HAND IT OVER TO DIANE TO DO  THE REST OF THE PRESENTATION, AND THEN WE'LL BE HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS.
00:40:35.407: >> THANK YOU, SHAWN. THANK YOU, COMMISSION MEMBERS. I WANTED TO WALK YOU THROUGH AN OVERVIEW OF THE VIC VILLAGE SOUTH PROJECT. AS SHAWN MENTIONED, WE ARE ON SOUTH UNIVERSITY AVENUE, AND WE ARE BETWEEN EAST UNIVERSITY AND CHURCH STREET, TAKING PRETTY MUCH THE WHOLE BLOCK, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF 16 -- OF A RESTAURANT ESTABLISHMENT NOT INCLUDED IN THIS PROPERTY. WE ARE 13 STORIES OF PRIMARILY STUDENT HOUSING, AND AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE RENDERING, PRIMARILY A BRICK BUILDING WITH METAL PANEL ACCENTS AND STONE ACCENTS AS WELL. WE HAVE TWO LEVELS OF UNDERGROUND PARKING PROPOSED FOR A TOTAL OF ABOUT 71 OFF-STREET SPACES THAT WOULD BE FOR RESIDENT USE ONLY. AND I AM GOING TO SEE HOW FAST THIS WILL SCROLL THROUGH. THAT'S BRINGING US TO OUR LOWER LEVEL PLANS OF PARKING, AND THEN UP TO THE FIRST FLOOR, WHERE YOU CAN SEE A BIT MORE OF THE SITE AND HOW IT FRONTS ON SOUTH UNIVERSITY AVENUE AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN AND THEN CONNECTS, ACTUALLY, BETWEEN EAST UNIVERSITY AND CHURCH STREET AT THE SOUTHERN PORTION OF THE SITE, AND THAT THAT ALLEY WOULD ACTUALLY BE CREATING A PEDESTRIAN WALKWAY BETWEEN THOSE TWO STREETS. THE FIRST FLOOR CONSISTS MAINLY OF RETAIL, COMMERCIAL TENANT SPACES, AND THEN YOU CAN ALSO SEE THE PARKING RAMP TO THE BELOW GRADE PARKING OFF OF EAST UNIVERSITY AVENUE. THE BUILDING CONSISTS OF ABOUT 133 LIVING UNITS. WE ARE FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON ONE, TWO, THREE, AND FOUR-BEDROOM UNITS FOR THIS PROJECT, NO FIVE OR SIX-BEDROOM UNITS ARE PROPOSED AT THIS TIME, AND WE ARE ALSO INCORPORATING AFFORDABLE HOUSING INTO THIS DEVELOPMENT AS WELL. AMENITY SPACES ARE GATHERED MOSTLY ON THE SECOND FLOOR, AND THEN AS YOU MOVE UP TO THE BUILDING, THE 13th FLOOR. I'M GETTING USED TO THIS MOUSE [ LAUGHTER ] -- WOULD PROVIDE AMENITY SPACES FOR THE RESIDENTS AND AN AMENITY PATIO AS WELL OVERLOOKING THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN DIAG. AND LOOKING AT THE NORTH FACADE OF THE BUILDING, WHICH IS RIGHT ON SOUTH UNIVERSITY AVENUE, THE MAIN RESIDENTIAL ENTRANCE, SOMEWHAT CENTERED ON THE BUILDING, AND DISTINGUISHING ITSELF WITH THE USE OF DIFFERENT MATERIALS, CAST STONE AND STONE FRAMING THE RESIDENTIAL ENTRANCE, DIFFERENT MODULES OF RETAIL AND COMMERCIAL SPACES ALONG THE FIRST FLOOR, AND THEN THE NORTHWEST CORNER OF THE BUILDING ACTUALLY HAVING A RECESS AT THE FIRST TWO FLOORS, AND THEN BRINGING DOWN A STRUCTURAL COLUMN ELEMENT AT THE BOTTOM OF THE 12-STORY GLASS TOWER, AND LOOKING TO INCORPORATE KIND OF A VISUAL GRAPHIC TO HELP DEFINE THE AREA. IN THIS CASE, IT IS A V LOGO FOR VIC VILLAGE SOUTH. AS YOU KNOW, VIC VILLAGE NORTH HAS JUST OPENED JUST ACROSS THE STREET. AS WE MOVE TO THE SOUTH ELEVATION ALONG THE ALLEY, AND THEN THE WEST ELEVATION AT EAST UNIVERSITY AVENUE, ADDITIONAL RETAIL, COMMERCIAL SPACES, ENTRANCE TO THE PARKING GARAGE. AND THEN ALONG CHURCH STREET, THERE IS ALSO A RETAIL ELEMENT CONNECTING THE EXISTING RESTAURANT ESTABLISHMENT, WHICH WILL BE GOOD TIME CHARLIE'S, AND THEN THE PIZZA HOUSE ESTABLISHMENT TRYING TO MAKE A CONNECTION AS WELL WITH RETAIL AND COMMERCIAL ESTABLISHMENTS. A SECTION OF THE BUILDING SHOWS THE BUILDING HEIGHT TO BE 150 FEET TOTAL. THAT'S TO THE TOP OF THE MECHANICAL EQUIPMENT SCREEN. THE BUILDING ITSELF WOULD BE MORE AROUND 140, 141 FEET. AGAIN, TWO LEVELS OF UNDERGROUND PARKING FACILITIES, AND THAT BRINGS US BACK TO THE ORIGINAL RENDERING, SHOWING THE MASSING, ARTICULATION, AND MATERIALS. AND THANK YOU.
00:45:38.509: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  THANK YOU. AND WE WILL HEAD TO MR. KOWALSKI FOR A STAFF REPORT.
00:45:46.651: >> THANK YOU. I DON'T REALLY HAVE TOO MUCH TO ADD. THERE'S NOT A LOT OF COMPLEXITY TO THE SITE. I CAN SAY THIS IS A PROJECT THAT HAS BEEN IN THE WORKS FOR A WHILE. DISCUSSIONS WITH PLANNING COMMISSION -- I'M SORRY, NOT PLANNING COMMISSION, PLANNING STAFF, INCLUDING WITH THE DDA AS WELL COORDINATING THE STREET SCAPING IMPROVEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN ONGOING FOR A YEAR OR SO RIGHT NOW, SO THOSE DISCUSSIONS BEGAN QUITE A WHILE AGO, AND SO THOSE DETAILS ARE ALL FLESHED OUT. REALLY THE ONLY THING ELSE TO ADD THAT'S A LITTLE UNIQUE ABOUT THIS PROJECT, IT'S THE FIRST PROJECT THAT WE HAVE SEEN THAT IS UTILIZING THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING PREMIUM, SO THAT WILL BE REGULATED IN THE SAME WAY AS OUR OTHER AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROGRAMS. IT WOULD -- IT'S A DEED RESTRICTION FOR THE LIFE OF THE PROJECT. I BELIEVE IT'S 14 UNITS THAT WOULD NEED TO BE AFFORDABLE FOR THE LIFE OF THE PROJECT. REALLY, THERE ARE NO NATURAL FEATURES ON THE SITE. THERE IS ONE LANDMARK TREE, ACTUALLY, WHICH IS IN THE RIGHT-OF-WAY, AND THAT WILL HAVE TO BE REMOVED FOR THE PROJECT AND WILL BE REPLACED WITH VARIOUS OTHER TREES THROUGH THE RIGHT-OF-WAY AND THROUGH TREE MITIGATION PAYMENT. SO, THAT REALLY SUMMARIZES IT UP. AND STAFF IS RECOMMENDING APPROVAL AT THIS TIME.
00:46:55.853: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  THANK YOU. AT THIS TIME, I WOULD LIKE TO OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING ON THIS ITEM. IF THERE IS ANYBODY IN THE AUDIENCE WHO WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION ON THIS ITEM, PLEASE STEP UP TO THE PODIUM, STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS OF RECORD, AND YOU'LL HAVE UP TO THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
00:47:13.204: >> LET'S SEE IF I CAN REACH THIS. NOW CAN YOU HEAR ME?
00:47:15.940: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  YES, I CAN.
00:47:17.308: >> THANK YOU. MY NAME IS ETHEL POTTS, 1939 JACKSON ROAD, AND I'M REMEMBERING BACK TO THE CALTHORPE -- REPORT. WE HAD PICTURES. THE PICTURES WERE OF A STREET WITH TREES AND RETAIL ALONG AND RATHER LOW BUILDINGS. IS THIS BUILDING INTENDED TO FILL ANY PARTICULAR NEEDS OF ANN ARBOR, OF ANN ARBOR PEOPLE? OR IS IT JUST THE WISHES OF THE LAND SELLER AND THE DEVELOPER THAT ARE BEING CONSIDERED HERE? DOES IT FILL ANY OF OUR NEEDS? THE DOWNTOWN D1 AND D2 ZONING PLANS, AS IN THE UDC, THE UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE, STATES THAT THE LAND USE AND STANDARDS FOR SOUTH U STATES THAT IT IS THE OFFICIAL ADOPTED DOWNTOWN CHARACTER AREA OVERLAY. QUOTE -- LET ME QUOTE THE OVERLAY, THE CHARACTER AREA OVERLAY. THE INTENT AND STANDARDS OF THIS OVERLAY DISTRICT ARE A MIX OF BUILDING TYPES AND SIZES. RETAIL FIRST ON THE FIRST LEVEL SHOULD CONTINUE TO REFLECT NARROW LOTS WITH SMALL-SCALE WIDTHS AND HEIGHTS. ANY HEIGHT -- ANY TALL OF THE BUILDING SHOULD BE AT THE CENTER OF THE BLOCK, NOT UP TO THE CENTER OF THE STREET. RETAIN A VARIETY OF -- MINIMIZE IMPACTS ON NEARBY RESIDENTIAL STREETS. THIS IS THE END OF THE QUOTES FROM YOUR OWN CITY CODE. WILL THE COMMISSION -- WILL THE COMMISSION DISCUSS THE OVERLAY DISTRICT? IN THE PAST, THE COMMISSION HAS NOT. I HAVE ATTENDED YOUR MEETINGS WHERE YOU HAVE DONE DOWNTOWN BUILDINGS THAT HAVE AN OVERLAY CHARACTER AREA, AND NOTHING WAS EVER SAID BY COMMISSION ABOUT THIS. DOES THE STAFF REPORT SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THE CHARACTER AREA OVERLAYS? I DON'T THINK SO. AT WHAT POINT ARE WE GOING TO DEAL WITH THEM? THEY ARE IN YOUR CITY CODE. THEY ARE THE LAW, THE LOCAL LAW. AT THE TIME -- AT THE TIME OF WRITING AND ADOPTING THE D1 AND D2 ZONINGS, THE PUBLIC WAS ASSURED THAT THE CHARACTER OVERLAYS WOULD PROTECT EXISTING SMALL-SCALE RESIDENTIAL AND RETAIL BUILDINGS. THAT WAS THE PURPOSE OF IT, IS TO LET ANN ARBOR CONTINUE TO BE ANN ARBOR. WILL YOU BE DISCUSSING THAT TONIGHT? I HOPE SO. WILL YOU STATE YOUR REASONS FOR YOUR VOTE, AND WILL THE REASONS FOR YOUR VOTE BE IN THE MINUTES ALSO? THANK YOU.
00:50:22.960: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION IN REGARDS TO THIS ITEM? SEEING NO ONE, I WILL CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING, AND I WILL READ THE MOTION. THE ANN ARBOR PLANNING COMMISSION HEREBY RECOMMENDS THAT THE CITY COUNCIL APPROVE THE VIC VILLAGE SOUTH SITE PLAN AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT, SUBJECT TO COMBINING THE LOTS PRIOR TO ISSUANCE OF ANY PERMITS. MOVED BY COMMISSIONER SAUVE, SECOND BY COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT. WE ARE IN DISCUSSION. COMMISSIONER BRIGGS?
00:51:02.967: >> COMISSIONER BRIGGS:  SO, I FORGOT MY COMPUTER AT HOME, SO I DON'T HAVE ALL OF MY NOTES, BUT I'LL TRY TO GO OFF OF MEMORY. SO, A FEW THINGS THAT I REMEMBER, I WANTED TO FOLLOW UP ON, ONE -- I NOTICED IN THE REPORT REGARDING THE PUBLIC MEETING REPORT, ONE OF THE QUESTIONS WAS ABOUT SIDEWALKS AND THE WIDTH OF THEM AROUND THE BUILDING, AND IT WAS I THINK BETWEEN THREE AND FIVE FEET FOR THE SIDEWALKS, WAS THE RESPONSE.
00:51:32.263: >> I THINK THAT'S REFERRING MORE TO TOWARDS THE BACK SIDE OF THE PROPERTY, BECAUSE THE ONES ALONG THE STREETS ARE DICTATED. WE DON'T HAVE CONTROL OF THOSE.
00:51:39.103: >> OKAY.
00:51:40.671: >> SO, YEAH, SO THAT'S -- THAT QUESTION WAS PRIMARILY HOW DOES THAT PEDESTRIAN PATHWAY WORK IF I'M COMING FROM EAST UNIVERSITY OVER TO CHURCH STREET, SO, CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG, TOM, BUT FROM EAST U TO THE MIDDLE OF THE BUILDING, YOU HAVE A FIVE-FOOT WALK. AND THEN IF YOU GO THROUGH THE PORTION OF THE BUILDING THAT'S ON THE NORTH SIDE, THAT'S A THREE-FOOT WALK, WHICH MOST PEOPLE PROBABLY AREN'T GOING TO USE THAT, BUT IF YOU GO TO THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE BUILDING --
00:52:06.931: >> CAN YOU SHOW ME WHERE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, WHERE THE THREE-FOOT WALK MIGHT BE? BECAUSE THAT WAS --
00:52:14.605: >> YEP. SO, THIS SECTION HERE IS FIVE FEET, AS YOU COME ACROSS HERE. THEN YOU HAVE AN OPTION. YOU CAN EITHER CONTINUE TO GO BACK THROUGH THIS PORTION RIGHT HERE. THAT PORTION IS ONLY THREE FEET. BUT THEN IF YOU COME BACK OVER THIS SIDEWALK, THE SYMBOL SHOWS IT BETTER THAN THIS PLAN, BUT THERE'S A WALK HERE. THAT WALK IS -- FOUR FEET, TOM? YES, FOUR FEET THERE, SO YOU HAVE A BARRIER BETWEEN FIVE AND THREE FEET, AS THEY WALK THROUGH THE MID BLOCK OF THE BUILDING.
00:52:44.669: >> OKAY, OKAY.
00:52:45.303: >> YEAH, THE OTHER ONES ARE ALL DICTATED BY CITY ORDINANCE AND EVERYTHING.
00:52:49.607: >> THAT MAKES SENSE.
00:52:51.709: >> WE ARE PUTTING BACK OR MAKING BIGGER.
00:52:54.945: >> SERIOUS CONCERNS IF --
00:52:55.980: >> YEAH, IT'S A LITTLE CONFUSING.
00:52:58.616: >> OKAY. AND THEN WITH REGARDS TO THE BICYCLE PARKING, I SAW THAT THERE'S FOUR CLASS C, WHICH IF I'M CORRECT, FROM THE GOOGLE STREET MAP, IT LOOKED LIKE THERE WERE EXISTING BIKE PARKING, MAYBE OUTSIDE ON CHURCH STREET AS IS. IS THAT THE FOUR CLASS C OR TWO CLASS C?
00:53:18.536: >> NO. IT WOULD BE RIGHT HERE.
00:53:20.604: >> YEP.
00:53:20.838: >> OKAY. OKAY.
00:53:22.673: >> SO IT DOES NOT INCLUDE THE PARKING WITHIN THE RIGHT-OF-WAY.
00:53:26.610: >> OKAY.
00:53:26.877: >> THAT PARKING WILL BE REPLACED AS THE DDA --
00:53:29.213: >> OKAY.
00:53:30.381: >> WE WILL REPLACE LIKE FOR LIKE ON THE NORTH SIDE, SO ALL OF THE BIKE HOOPS, EVERYTHING THAT IS CURRENTLY THERE AS PART OF THE STREET SCAPE PLANS, WE WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR PUTTING BACK AFTER WE END CONSTRUCTION, JUST AS WE DID ON THE NORTH PROJECT.
00:53:46.130: >> AND I HAD A CALL INTO THE DDA ABOUT THIS, BUT THEY DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO GIVE ME A CALL BACK. I AM SURE YOU HAVE TALKED MORE EXTENSIVELY WITH THEM AROUND POTENTIALLY BICYCLE PARKING. I WAS SURPRISED FOR -- IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S A LOT OF BICYCLE PARKING INSIDE ON THE FIRST FLOOR, AND I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR ABOUT THAT IN A SECOND, BUT GIVEN THE DENSITY OF THIS BUILDING AND THE POPULATION THAT IT'S SERVING, WHICH IS STUDENT POPULATION, IT SEEMS SURPRISING THERE'S NOT ACTUALLY THAT MUCH BICYCLE PARKING OUT FRONT, WHERE PEOPLE WOULD WANT TO USE IT DURING THE FAIR WEATHER MONTHS, AND I'M CURIOUS HOW YOU WOULD ANTICIPATE --
00:54:19.296: >> WE DON'T CONTROL, OBVIOUSLY, THAT'S DICTATED BY THE DDA AND THEIR STREET SCAPE PLAN, SO THE NUMBER OF BIKE HOOPS AND EVERYTHING THAT HAVE BEEN THERE WERE PART OF THE APPROVAL WHEN THAT WENT THROUGH WHATEVER THE PROCESS WAS WITH THE CITY, SO THAT ISN'T ANYTHING THAT WE CAN CONTROL. WE CAN ONLY CONTROL WHAT'S IN THE BUILDING AND ON SITE.
00:54:36.280: >> YEAH.
00:54:36.647: >> AND I CAN JUST ADD TO THAT, IT WAS NOT DIRECTLY INVOLVED THROUGH THE DDA, BUT IT WAS THE SOURCE OF MANY DISCUSSIONS, HOW MUCH BICYCLE PARKING YOU PUT IN THE RIGHT-OF-WAY. YOU KNOW, THERE'S TRADEOFFS. TOO MUCH, IT GETS CONGESTED, SO IT IS A DDA -- SHAWN IS CORRECT. IT IS A DDA DECISION. IT HAS BEEN THOUGHT THROUGH. I CAN'T RESPOND TO ALL OF THE SPECIFICS OF IT.
00:54:57.535: >> YEAH, I GUESS MAYBE THERE'S A QUESTION TO FOLLOW UP ON WITH THEM -- IT'S MORE OF THE ONSTREET PARKING THAT COULD PROBABLY BE USED FOR BIKE CORRALS.
00:55:06.710: >> EXACTLY, AND THAT'S A WHOLE --
00:55:10.047: >> AND THEN I HAD I HAD ANOTHER QUESTION AROUND IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S ONE PUBLIC ON STREET PARKING SPACE THAT'S BEING REMOVED FOR THIS. COULD YOU TALK ABOUT IT? IT LOOKS LIKE THAT'S A ONE-TIME COST.
00:55:22.326: >> IT IS. SO WITH THE DDA, I THINK, MATT, IT'S LIKE 75,000 OR SOMETHING TO REMOVE THAT PARKING SPACE, AND SO WHAT THAT STEMMED FROM WAS A NUMBER OF THESE CONVERSATIONS, LIKE MATT HAD, SAID THAT WE HAD BETWEEN THE DDA, ENGINEERING, AND TRAFFIC OF WHERE DO YOU PUT THE RAMP INTO THE BUILDING, AND IT WAS DETERMINED BETWEEN ALL OF THOSE, OUR CONSULTANT AS WELL, THAT COMING OFF OF EAST U WAS THE PREFERRED LOCATION TO HAVE THAT, AND SO AS A RESULT OF THAT, WE OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO REDUCE ONE PARKING SPACE BECAUSE OF, YOU KNOW, DISTANCE THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE TO THE SOUTH UNIVERSITY, BUT ALSO TOO ONE OF THE COMMENTS THAT CAME BACK FROM BOTH DDA AND I THINK ENGINEERING, MAYBE, WAS WE ARE ACTUALLY BEING REQUIRED ON THAT CORNER THERE TO ACTUALLY BUMP THAT CORNER ACTUALLY FURTHER OUT THAN WHAT IT CURRENTLY IS RIGHT NOW.
00:56:15.880: >> OKAY. AND I KNOW THIS IS NOT IN OUR REGULATIONS, SO IT'S NOT REALLY SOMETHING THAT -- I KNOW IT CAME UP IN SORT OF THE PUBLIC QUESTIONS THAT YOU RECEIVED, BUT WE DON'T -- IN TERMS OF LYFT AND UBER, WE ARE NOT REQUIRING THAT FOR LARGE DEVELOPMENTS RIGHT NOW TO PROVIDE THAT SPACE. IS THAT CORRECT?
00:56:34.265: >> THAT'S CORRECT.
00:56:36.767: >> AND I THINK WE SHOULD BE PUTTING THAT ON TO OUR WORK PLAN AT SOME POINT. WE CAN'T HAVE DEVELOPMENTS OF THIS TYPE AND SAY, OH, WELL, WE'LL JUST SUGGEST THAT THEY PARK OVER ON THE SIDE. WE KNOW THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. I MEAN, THIS IS REALLY BECOMING A PROBLEM IN OUR DOWNTOWN.
00:56:53.050: >> I THINK THAT THE CHALLENGE THAT YOU HAVE IS HOW DO YOU DO THAT ON AN URBAN SITE, AND THAT IT'S SOMETHING THAT I THINK IS A BIGGER OVERREACHING THAN JUST SAYING TO A DEVELOPER THAT IT NEEDS TO BE DONE, OBVIOUSLY. I KNOW THERE HAVE BEEN CONVERSATIONS AT ONE POINT IN TIME WITH THE VARIOUS LOADING ZONES THAT ARE ON BOTH EAST UNIVERSITY AND CHURCH STREET OF, HEY, IN THE EVENING TIME, WE ARE GOING TO MAKE THEM THE UBER AND THE LYFT AREAS OR WE ARE GOING TO MAKE THEM THE AMAZON AREA. WE GET HUNDREDS OF PACKAGES EVERY DAY INTO OUR BUILDING, SO IT OBVIOUSLY IS AN ISSUE BETWEEN UPS, FedEx, AMAZON, ALL OF THESE, OF HOW DO YOU HANDLE AN URBAN AREA.
00:57:31.989: >> PROBABLY AMAZON IS BIGGER. THEN CAN YOU TALK ABOUT HOW THAT FRONT ENTRANCE HAS EVOLVED SINCE THE DESIGN? WAS INITIALLY PROPOSED?
00:57:46.904: >> SO --
00:57:47.805: >> YEAH, IT'S EASIER TO GO THIS WAY.
00:57:52.176: >> I THINK --
00:57:52.509: >> DURING OUR INITIAL DESIGN REVIEW BOARD PROCESS, WE HAD A TOTALLY DIFFERENT DESIGN AT THE NORTHWEST CORNER. IT WAS RECESSED, SOMEWHAT LIKE IT'S SHOWN NOW, BUT ONLY AT THE FIRST FLOOR AND PART OF THE SECOND FLOOR AND DID NOT HAVE ANYTHING REALLY, I THINK, GROUNDING IT OR MAKING IT STAND OUT, SO FOR OUR SECOND ROUND OF DESIGN REVIEW BOARD, WE TOOK A TOTALLY DIFFERENT APPROACH AND REALLY TOOK OUT ANY RECESSES AT THIS END AND BROUGHT THE WHOLE BUILDING DOWN, BUT, AGAIN, I THINK THE CONCERN WAS THAT IT DID NOT STAND OUT OR WAS NOT -- DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH CHARACTER, AND THERE WAS SOME CONCERN ABOUT, YOU KNOW, IF YOU WANTED TO SAY, YOU KNOW, MEET ME AT THE CLOCK TOWER OR ANYTHING, YOU KNOW, OR MEET ME AT, IN THIS CASE, THE V, WHERE WE ARE TAKING A RECESS OUT OF BOTH FIRST AND SECOND FLOOR AND THEN BRINGING DOWN A DOMINANT FEATURE TO HELP ANCHOR THIS SPOT AT THAT REALLY LIVELY ACTIVE CORNER.
00:59:06.717: >> AT ONE POINT IN TIME, EVEN THE FACADES WERE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT ON THE SECOND FLOOR, AND SO WE TOOK BACK THOSE COMMENTS OF THE ONE THAT, LIKE SHE SAID, ONE OF THE BIG THINGS WAS WHAT'S THE IDENTIFYING FEATURE SO I CAN TELL SOMEBODY MEET ME AT THIS LOCATION, AND THAT'S WHAT WE CAME BACK WITH, SO --
00:59:23.133: >> SO THIS IS AFTER THE SECOND SORT OF ROUND OF DESIGN?
00:59:25.903: >> CORRECT, YEAH.
00:59:26.637: >> SO, I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS GOING TO EVOLVE ANYMORE, AND I KNOW THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE OUR RECOMMENDATIONS, BUT THIS IS KITTY-CORNER TO THE DIAG, RIGHT? ONE OF THE MOST ICONIC ENTRANCES, LIKE, ONE OF THE MOST ICONIC SPOTS IN OUR CITY, I WOULD SAY, AND WHAT I'M LOOKING AT FROM THE INITIAL PICTURES IS YOU SORT OF LOOK ACROSS AND SEE A BIG COLUMN WITH A V ON IT, AND, YOU KNOW --
00:59:56.834: >> THERE'S ALSO --
00:59:57.534: >> THAT'S NOT A REASON THAT WE CANNOT APPROVE THE BUILDING. I JUST THINK IT IS A REALLY WASTED OPPORTUNITY FOR YOUR BUILDING.
01:00:03.941: >> THERE ARE ALSO SOME THINGS THAT THAT YOU CAN'T REALLY SEE, BUT WE ARE DOING SOME NICE LIGHT FEATURES AT THE FRONT TO REALLY LIVEN AND BRIGHTEN UP THAT AREA
01:00:12.616: >>.
01:00:12.783: >> I AM SURE THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT I CAN'T SEE, BUT THE THINGS THAT I CAN SEE, THIS SEEMS -- THIS BUILDING IS GOING TO BE AROUND FOR A LONG TIME. THIS IS THE CHARACTER OF SOUTH U. THIS IS WHAT PEOPLE ARE SEEING, AND THERE'S SOME OPPORTUNITY HERE TO REALLY, I THINK, PUSH THIS A LITTLE BIT FURTHER, TO MAKE THIS SOMETHING THAT IS BEAUTIFUL COMING OUT OF THE DIAG. I MEAN, YOU'RE COMING OUT OF ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SPOTS OF OUR TOWN, AND THE BUILDING ITSELF IS WHAT WE ARE SORT OF USED TO SEEING IN TERMS OF STUDENT HIGH RISES, AND I THINK MUCH OF IT IS FINE. BUT I DO THINK THAT THAT ENTRANCEWAY COULD USE A LITTLE BIT OF EMPHASIS TO MAKE THAT SOMETHING THAT IS MEMORABLE FOR OUR COMMUNITY.
01:00:58.796: >> AND I THINK THE CHALLENGE THAT YOU HAVE AND PART OF THE REASON WHY YOU GO THROUGH DESIGN REVIEW BOARD IS EVERYBODY IS GOING TO HAVE THEIR OWN SLIGHT TAKE ON WHAT DOES THAT MEAN, BECAUSE WE COULD MAKE ANOTHER CHANGE, AND YOU MAY LIKE IT, BUT YOU MAY NOT LIKE IT, AND NOW THAT'S NOT GOING FAR ENOUGH, SO THAT'S THE CHALLENGING ASPECT THAT WE HAVE AT THAT ASPECT.
01:01:17.881: >> I CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE THAT TO BE TRUE, BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT CAME UP AT BOTH DESIGN REVIEW MEETINGS, AND AFTER THE SECOND ONE, THERE WAS STILL AN EMPHASIS TO PUSH ON THIS AREA, AND SO WE ARE THE NEXT BODY TO SEE THAT AFTER IT, AND I AM SURE THAT IF YOU ASK EACH ONE OF US, THERE WILL BE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT REACTIONS TO THIS. HOWEVER, I'LL BE CURIOUS TO HEAR WHAT OTHERS SAY, BUT I DO THINK THAT IS SOMETHING THAT COULD USE ADDITIONAL EMPHASIS AND WOULD BE WORTH IT FOR THE COMMUNITY TO SEE THAT. COULD YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING? THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT WE HAVE SEEN SOMETHING LIKE THAT COME HERE, AND WE HAVE HAD QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE, IN TERMS OF INTERNALLY MANAGING --
01:01:56.854: >> SO I CAN'T SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS HOW THAT IS HANDLED FROM A MANAGEMENT STANDPOINT, SO OUR OPERATOR, WHO WE ARE UTILIZING ON THE NORTH PROJECT, IS ASSET LIVING. THEY ARE THE LARGEST THIRD-PARTY OPERATOR OF STUDENT HOUSING, MULTI-FAMILY AND THAT IN THE U.S. AND SO WE HAVE HAD A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM. THEY ARE LIKE, YES, WE MANAGE -- WE HAVE A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT PROJECTS AT DIFFERENT LOCATIONS THAT DO THIS TYPE OF THING, BECAUSE IT IS BECOMING MORE COMMON TO INCORPORATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING INTO DEVELOPMENTS AND EVERYTHING ELSE, SO I DON'T HAVE THE SPECIFICS, BUT OUR MANAGER DOES HAVE THE EXPERIENCE OF HOW THEY HANDLE THAT ASPECT.
01:02:38.095: >> I AM SURE STAFF HAS THOUGHT ABOUT THIS. IF I REMEMBER CORRECT, IT WAS 80% AMI, IS THE NUMBER? SO CONSIDERING THIS IS A BUILDING THAT SERVES A STUDENT POPULATION AND THAT IS A POPULATION THAT IS OFTEN UNDER THE POVERTY LINE ANYWAY, I'M CURIOUS WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE IN TERMS OF PROVIDING THESE PREMIUMS AND HOW WE -- HOW WE CONSIDER THAT AS A CITY.
01:03:05.188: >> NO, IT'S A GOOD QUESTION. WHEN THEY REGISTERED AS AFFORDABLE UNITS THROUGH THE COUNTY PROGRAM, THEN THE COUNTY WILL HAVE TO TAKE FROM THAT TO FILL THESE AFFORDABLE UNITS. BUT, YOU'RE RIGHT, I MEAN, ANYBODY CAN -- WE CAN'T DISCRIMINATE STUDENT OR NONSTUDENT OR WHO GETS ON THAT LIST, SO, YES, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT STUDENTS COULD GET ON THAT LIST. THEY WOULD HAVE ALREADY BE ON THAT LIST. WE ARE NOT JUST GOING TO HAVE STUDENTS WALKING IN OFF THE STREET.
01:03:32.716: >> SO THEY ARE COMING THROUGH THE COUNTY.
01:03:35.285: >> EXACTLY, IT'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE THROUGH THE PROGRAM. IT WILL BE MANAGED IN A SIMILAR WAY AS OTHER AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROGRAMS, BUT, YES, YOU'RE CORRECT, THAT'S SOMETHING WE MAY STRUGGLE WITH, THE OCCUPANT --
01:03:48.932: >> OKAY. THAT'S IT FOR NOW. THANKS.
01:03:52.869: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN: COMMISSIONER WOODS? I FEEL LIKE A TEETER TOTTER.
01:03:55.372: >> YEAH, THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT. SO, JUST A FEW MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT NORTHWEST CORNER. CAN YOU TELL US WHAT ONE WOULD SEE LOOKING AT IT FROM ACROSS THE STREET ON THE INTERIOR OF THE BUILDING? I MEAN, ARE YOU -- I THINK THE DESIGN REVIEW BOARD SAID SOMETHING LIKE MAYBE A LARGE CHANDELIER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT PUBLIC ART OR WHAT YOU'RE PLANNING FOR THAT, BUT --
01:04:38.682: >> THERE WE GO. SO, OBVIOUSLY, WE HAVEN'T FULLY VETTED OUT THE WHOLE LIGHTING SCHEME, BUT WE DO HAVE SOME LIGHTS UP THERE IN REGARDS TO THAT. THERE ARE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE CAN HAVE, OBVIOUSLY, WITH AN ARTIST, OF DOING SOMETHING ON THAT COLUMN AS WELL, SO THERE'S A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY THAT WE HAVE THERE. I DON'T WANT TO SAY THAT WE HAVE ALL OF THE ANSWERS RIGHT AT THIS MOMENT OF WHAT EXACTLY WE ARE GOING TO DO THERE. I KNOW ONE OF THE CONVERSATIONS, AND I KNOW I'M KIND OF JUMPING, BUT IT TIES BACK IN, IS WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE BACK AREA, HOW DO WE MAKE THAT PEDESTRIAN FRIENDLY. WE ARE DOING A LOT OF LIGHTING. WE ARE GOING TO TALK WITH AN ARTIST, ON ONE OF THE WALLS -- WE HAVE A BUILDING WHERE THE STEAKHOUSE IS DOWNTOWN, AND WE DID A MURAL IN THAT ALLEY WAY, SO THERE ARE THOSE TYPES OF THINGS THAT WE WILL LOOK AT THERE AND LOOK AT THIS AREA AS WELL. WHAT ALSO HAPPENS HERE TOO THOUGH IS THE FIRST-FLOOR TENANT, THIS DOESN'T GO ALL THE WAY OUT ALL THE WAY TO THE PROPERTY LINE, SO IT SITS FURTHER BACK, SO IT CREATES AN OUTDOOR AREA FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO UTILIZE SEATING OR FOR PEOPLE TO COME IN AND DO SEATING AS WELL, WHILE STILL WALKING THROUGH AND BEING ABLE TO SEE ACROSS CORNER TO CORNER THERE. IT'S NOT LIKE YOU COME AND THERE'S A COLUMN RIGHT THERE. LET ME GO TO THE FIRST FLOOR.
01:06:02.599: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS:  DOES THAT COLUMN HAVE TO BE MADE OUT OF CEMENT?
01:06:06.803: >> IT'S AN ACTUAL STRUCTURAL COLUMN, CORRECT?
01:06:08.638: >> THERE IS A CONCRETE COLUMN WITHIN THE COLUMN ENCLOSURE, BUT THE ENCLOSURE IS INTENDED TO BE MORE OF A STONE MATERIAL, A GRANITE BASE AND CAST STONE.
01:06:19.916: >> SO THIS KIND OF SHOWS THAT WE CREATE A LITTLE BIT OF RAILING HERE AROUND THIS, SO THAT IT STILL CREATES A PEDESTRIAN AREA, WHERE PEDESTRIANS CAN BE UNDERNEATH THE BUILDING AS WELL. IT CREATES AN AREA IN HERE THAT TENANTS CAN UTILIZE TO HAVE SOME SEATING AS WELL.
01:06:32.829: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS:  OKAY. SO THAT'S JUST FOR THE RETAIL TENANT, WHATEVER THAT BUSINESS IS RIGHT THERE, TO COME IN AND OUT OF THAT ENTRANCE.
01:06:44.074: >> YEP.
01:06:44.908: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS:  SO DO YOU HAVE ANY SENSE YET AS TO WHETHER OR NOT SOME OF THE CURRENT BUSINESSES ALONG THAT STREET ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO BE A PART OF YOUR -- WE DO, MOST OF THE BUSINESSES THAT ARE THERE HAVE BEEN RELOCATED, SO PNC BANK, WHICH IS THERE, IS ACTUALLY MOVING ACROSS AND TO THE NORTH -- VIC VILLAGE NORTH PROJECT. UNDERGROUND PRINTING IS MOVING ACROSS TO VIC VILLAGE NORTH AS WELL. OASIS RESTAURANT IS MOVING WHERE THE OLD CHINA GATE RESTAURANT USED TO BE AT, SO THERE ARE A LOT OF THOSE THAT HAVE RELOCATED ALREADY WITHIN THE BLOCK AREA, SO IT DOES LEAVE A LOT OPEN THERE. WE HAVE SOME -- WE HAVE HAD SOME INTEREST FROM OTHER BUSINESSES IN THE AREA TO LOOK AT THAT. WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN ANY FURTHER IN THERE, OBVIOUSLY, YET, WITH THEM, BUT THERE HAS BEEN SOME DISCUSSION WITH OTHER BUSINESSES ON THAT AREA.
01:07:34.958: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS:  OKAY. AND SO YOU -- THIS PROPERTY AND THEN THE ONE RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET FROM IT, SO IT'S V NORTH AND V SOUTH?
01:07:42.532: >> YEP, VIC VILLAGE NORTH AND VIC VILLAGE SOUTH.
01:07:45.035: >> SO HAS THERE BEEN ANY DISCUSSION ABOUT SOME SORT OF A WALKWAY BETWEEN YOUR TWO PROPERTIES? AN OVERHEAD?
01:07:54.945: >> NO, THAT'S WAY TOO COSTLY TO DO. TRUST ME, WE THOUGHT ABOUT IT.
01:07:59.482: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS:  UH-HUH, OKAY. I'M JUST CURIOUS. OKAY. THANK YOU.
01:08:05.021: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN: COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL.
01:08:06.056: >> COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL: WHEN I WAS LOOKING FROM THE STREET LEVEL AT THE EXISTING CONDITIONS, THERE'S I THINK LIKE SEVEN BUSINESSES ALL ALONG SOUTH UNIVERSITY THERE, AND IF YOU ZOOM OUT A LITTLE BIT FROM THE SCREEN --
01:08:17.200: >> OH, SORRY, YEAH.
01:08:21.771: >> COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL: YOU'RE IN THE RIGHT SLIDE, BUT, YEAH. SO, NOW IT'S BECOMING THREE, AND I THINK PART OF THE CHARACTER OF THAT AREA IS THAT IT'S KIND OF CHEEK TO JAW WITH A WHOLE BUNCH OF LITTLE FUNKY BUSINESSES AND I THINK THAT'S PART OF THE APPEAL AND PART OF THE CHARACTER OVERLAY, THE INTENT WITH SOME OF THAT, AND I WAS JUST WONDERING HOW FLEXIBLE THESE SPACES COULD BE TO ACCOMMODATE ANY KIND OF FUTURE HOLE IN THE WALL SPOT THAT IS JUST, YOU KNOW -- I DON'T KNOW, THAT RETAINS SOME OF THAT.
01:08:54.237: >> THERE IS ALWAYS A CHALLENGE WITH THAT, OF HOW DO YOU DO THAT AND CREATE SOMETHING THAT'S STILL LEASABLE FROM A SPACE, AND SO OBVIOUSLY WITH THE OTHER ASPECTS THAT YOU HAVE TO PUT IN THERE, WITH THE VESTIBULE, THAT YOU GO TO LIKE OVER TENANT DEED SPACE, TRYING TO BREAK THAT UP, STILL GIVE THEM ACCESS TO A BACK SERVICE CORRIDOR, THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF CHALLENGES THAT BECOME RATHER CHALLENGING TO TRY TO BREAK THESE INTO MULTIPLE LITTLE ONES, WHICH IS HOW DO YOU SERVE THE BACK OF HOUSE BUT THEN ALSO HAVE THE RENTABLE SQUARE FOOTAGE NEEDED TO SUPPORT THAT. I'M NOT SAYING THAT THEY CAN'T GET SPLIT, BUT IT IS ALSO MARKET DRIVEN BY WHO ARE THE RETAIL TENANTS THAT WANT TO GO IN THERE. YOU SEE A LOT MORE RESTAURANTS THAT COME INTO THE DOWNTOWN AREA. THEY REQUIRE A LARGER SQUARE FOOTAGE THAN SOMEBODY ELSE DOES. OR YOU MAY HAVE A COFFEE SHOP. EVEN COFFEE SHOPS, SOME OF THE COFFEE SHOPS THAT WE HAVE HAVE SIZABLE SQUARE FOOTAGE AS WELL. SO IT IS A CHALLENGE, AND THE GREATEST CHALLENGE IS HOW DO YOU MAKE THE BUILDING CIRCULATION WORK WITH EVERYTHING ELSE THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE ON THE FIRST FLOOR. SO...
01:10:02.072: >> I GUESS I WOULD JUST REQUEST SOME FLEXIBILITY TO BE ABLE TO RETAIN THAT, IF POSSIBLE. I KNOW WITH SOME OTHER PROPERTIES WE HAVE HAD, I'M JUST KIND OF THINKING OF THE LOWER TOWN ONE THAT WE DID WHERE THEY WEREN'T QUITE SURE WHETHER IT WAS GOING TO BE, YOU KNOW, COMMERCIAL OR RESIDENTIAL, AND THEY WERE BUILDING THINGS TO BE ABLE TO BUILD FLEXIBILITY INTO THINGS, AND SO I WOULD JUST PUT THAT FORTH, THAT PART OF THE FEELING OF THAT PLACE IS THAT THERE -- I UNDERSTAND THERE'S DESIGN CHALLENGES, AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT THERE'S CURRENT CODE THAT YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW, WHICH IS DIFFERENT THAN WHEN IT WAS BUILT A LONG TIME AGO, BUT THAT IS PART OF THE CHANGE, I THINK, IS THAT FEELING OF THAT EVERY 20 FEET, YOU'RE PASSING SOMETHING DIFFERENT, YOU KNOW, THAT THAT IS NOT A BIG MONOLITHIC RETAIL EXPERIENCE THERE THAT FEELS MUCH MORE KIND OF SLEEK AND STANDARD, AND MAYBE THIS IS JUST THE CHANGING NATURE OF HOW THIS AREA IS GOING TO EVOLVE. I'M KIND OF TICKLED THAT YOU STILL HAVE GOOD TIME CHARLIE'S ON THE CORNER, EVEN THOUGH I THINK YOU GUYS PROBABLY HATE IT. I LIKE IT, THAT IT'S KIND OF TUCKED IN THERE, AND THERE'S THESE LITTLE REMNANTS OF OLDER BUILDINGS THAT ARE STILL IN THERE, THE HOLDOUTS TO KIND OF REMIND US OF WHAT THE CHARACTER HAS BEEN FOR A LONG TIME. SO, AGAIN, NOT A LOT THAT WE CAN LEGISLATE AT THIS POINT WITH THAT, BUT I GUESS I WOULD ASK YOU TO KEEP AN OPEN MIND ABOUT SOME OF THAT.
01:11:26.489: >> AND WE ALWAYS DO. I MEAN, IF WE -- WE HAVE ALWAYS LOOKED AT BUILDINGS AND CHANGED THINGS UP, YOU KNOW, EVEN ON THE NORTH PROJECT, WE HAD ONE TENANT WANTED TO TAKE ALL OF IT, AND, NOPE, THEY DIDN'T, AND THEN WE HAD A LITTLER SPACE, SO YOU TRY TO WORK WITH HOW THINGS EBB AND FLOW WITH WHO COMES IN AND WHO IS INTERESTED TOO.
01:11:48.611: >> COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL: AND I GUESS I HAVE A LARGER GLOBAL QUESTION. YOU ALL HAVE DONE QUITE A FEW DEVELOPMENTS NOW IN THIS AREA, AND WHAT DO YOU FEEL LIKE ARE LESSONS LEARNED FOR YOU? WHAT IS DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS BUILDING? WHAT DO YOU FEEL LIKE HAS EVOLVED IN TERMS OF YOUR APPROACH? I MEAN THE FIRST ONE WAS WAY DOWN IN SOUTH FOREST. THAT'S PRETTY DIFFERENT.
01:12:07.163: >> YEAH, THAT'S A LOT DIFFERENT DOWN THERE.
01:12:10.967: >> COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL: TELL US HOW YOU FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE EVOLVED, WHAT YOU ARE LEARNING, WHAT YOU FEEL -- WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS ONE? WHAT IS --
01:12:17.774: >> SO PART OF THE EVOLUTION OF THIS ONE IS -- AND PART OF THE REASON WHY WE HAVE THE VIC VILLAGE NAME, TO CREATE A VILLAGE IN THAT AREA, BECAUSE WE DO HAVE MULTIPLE PROPERTIES IN THAT THAT WE WILL EVENTUALLY REDEVELOP, WITH THIS ONE, WHAT YOU SEE IS YOU DON'T HAVE FIVE AND SIX BEDROOMS, SO IT'S TO COMPLEMENT THE ADJACENT BUILDING NEXT DOOR. AS WE LOOK AT THE AMENITY AREAS, WE ARE COMPLIMENTING THE TWO DIFFERENT PROPERTIES IN REGARDS TO THE TENANTS BEING ABLE TO UTILIZE EITHER SIDE OF THE PROJECT, SO IF I -- LIKE I HAVE A FITNESS ON DEMAND AND A FULL TYPE OF FITNESS ROOM OVER ON NORTH. HERE, WE ARE USING MORE OF A CROSS FIT TYPE ENVIRONMENT. IT'S A DIFFERENT TYPE OF THEME. WE ARE PUTTING MORE OF A GAME ROOM, LIKE XBOX, PLAY STATIONS. THAT'S THE NEWER THING NOWADAYS. SO YOU EVOLVE, OBVIOUSLY, AS YOU SEE THE MARKET, AND OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A STUDENT DRIVEN PROJECT, OBVIOUSLY, SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE CHANGED, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE LOOKED AT THERE, COMPLIMENTING EACH OTHER WITH THE BUILDINGS SO THAT THE PROJECTS COMPLEMENT. YOU LOOK AT THE DIFFERENT MATERIALS, AND THAT IS PARTLY, OBVIOUSLY, IS WHAT'S BEEN DRIVEN BY THIS BODY AND BY CITY COUNCIL IN REGARDS TO HOW DO YOU MODULATE, HOW DO YOU CHANGE MATERIALS. SO IN THIS BUILDING, YOU SEE A LOT MORE GLASS ON THIS ONE. I THINK WE HAD THE SAME AMOUNT OF BRICK TONES, LIKE NUMBER OF BRICK TONES, BUT DIFFERENT HOW WE APPLY THOSE AS WELL. YOU KNOW, BUT EVERY SITE IS UNIQUE. IT'S CHALLENGING.
01:13:48.665: >> SURE.
01:13:49.365: >> EVERYONE HAS GOT ITS OWN UNIQUE CHALLENGES.  YOU TRY TO LEARN WHAT YOU LEARNED ON THE OTHER ONES AND BRINGING THEM FORWARD TO WHAT YOU SEE THE INDUSTRY IS LOOKING AT. SO...
01:13:59.008: >> COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL: DO YOU SEE THIS AS -- I MEAN, I GUESS I'M THINKING OF WHAT MS. POTTS BROUGHT UP, JUST THINKING ABOUT THE CHARACTER OF THE PLACE AND EVERYTHING. IS THE PLAN TO PRETTY MUCH TAKE OVER THE ENTIRE AREA? I KNOW AGAIN WE ARE REVIEWING THIS, BUT WHAT IS EXACTLY THE PROCESS OF WHERE IS THE OVERLAY DISTRICT? HOW DOES THAT REALLY PLAY IN, REALLY, IN TERMS OF THE REVIEW PROCESS WITH THE STAFF? I MEAN, BECAUSE THEY ARE ALL IN THERE. THERE'S ALL OF THE DESCRIPTIONS IN THERE, AND YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO FOLLOW THEM AND EVERYTHING, BUT CLEARLY, THIS ONE REALLY IS PRETTY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT'S GOING IN, AND SO I'M JUST CURIOUS, LIKE, WHAT -- HOW DOES THAT GET WEIGHTED IN ALL OF THIS? YOU JUST KIND OF HOPE THAT YOU HAVE A COUPLE OF HOLDOUTS AND THAT YOU HAVE A FEW THREE AND FOUR-STORY BUILDINGS THAT ARE LEFT IN THERE? WHAT HAPPENS, REALLY? I'M JUST CURIOUS.
01:14:51.661: >> WELL, I MEAN, YOU KNOW, WE CAN'T STOP THE EVOLUTION, BUT THERE ARE -- LIKE YOU SAID, THERE'S OBVIOUSLY THE CHARACTER OVERLAY. THIS PROJECT, AND ANY FUTURE PROJECTS, WILL FALL WITHIN THOSE CHARACTER OVERLAY GUIDELINES, BUT THEY DON'T NECESSARILY -- IT CAN'T -- THEY REGULATE, AND IF YOU CAN SEE IN THE COMPARISON CHART, THERE'S ONLY SO MANY THINGS THEY REGULATE, LIKE SETBACKS, YOU KNOW, MASSING, AND I CAN'T THINK OF SOME OF THE OTHER TERMS OFFHAND -- YEAH, LIKE THE MASSING ARTICULATION, THE FRONT SETBACKS, OH, THE OFFSETS INTO STREET WALLS, SO PUSH IT BACK AND THINGS LIKE THAT, BUT THEY DON'T -- WE DON'T DELINEATE LIKE -- HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO SAY IT, LIKE STOREFRONTAGE EXACTLY.
01:15:35.938: >> SURE.
01:15:37.206: >> EXACTLY LIKE YOU SAID, SOME OF THEM ARE BARELY TEN FEET WIDE, IT SEEMS, BUT THE CHARACTER OVERLAYS DON'T REALLY ADDRESS THAT.
01:15:44.514: >> YEAH.
01:15:44.981: >> I MEAN, THEY DON'T. THERE'S LANGUAGE IN THERE THAT SAYS THESE ARE THE KIND OF THINGS THAT WE WANT TO LOOK TO HELP PRESERVE, AND WE'LL USE THAT IN SOME OF OUR ANALYSIS IN LOOKING AT THIS, AND A DESIGN REVIEW BOARD USED SOME OF THAT IN PUSHING BACK FROM SOME OF THEIR INITIAL ELEVATIONS IN USING THAT. SO, WE DO LOOK AT IT, AND WE DO USE IT, AND THE THINGS WHERE THERE ARE DEFINITIVE NUMBERS, YOU KNOW, IT MEETS IT, BUT IT'S REALLY HARD, AND I REMEMBER THE DISCUSSIONS VERY WELL, DO WE REGULATE BUILDING WIDTHS AND THINGS LIKE THAT TO KEEP THESE SMALLER THINGS. BUT THE FACT IS, IT IS TRUE, MANY OF THOSE NOW DON'T MEET BUILDING CODES OR PLANNING CODES, SO YOU COULDN'T RE-CREATE THOSE PIECES. SO IT IS A CHALLENGE, BUT WE KIND OF WORK IN THERE, AND WE CAN WORK WITH WHAT'S BROUGHT TO US AND TRY TO FORM IT IN THE BEST WAY THAT WE CAN TO GIVE IT TO YOU GUYS AND EVENTUALLY EVEN HIGHER. SO I DON'T KNOW IF THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION SPECIFICALLY, BUT IF THERE IS NOTHING STOPPING FROM REDEVELOPING WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE CODE, THE REST OF THE BLOCK OR ANYBODY ELSE.
01:16:50.179: >> COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL: SO, IN OTHER WORDS, IN TERMS OF THAT CHARACTER OVERLAY, THIS WHOLE FOUR-BLOCK AREA OR WHATEVER IT IS THAT GETS COVERED COULD TRULY BE ALL OF THESE SIZED BUILDINGS, AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH WHAT -- BECAUSE -- SO THE CHARACTER OVERLAY REALLY DOESN'T --
01:17:03.893: >> WELL, IT DOES. I MEAN, I THINK IT DOES SOME ARTICULATION. I THINK IT DOES HELP, BUT IT'S NOT GETTING YOU, I THINK, WHAT YOU WANT EXACTLY, WITH THE SMALLER --
01:17:15.238: >> COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL: AND I DON'T THINK IT ALL HAS TO STAY THE WAY THAT IT IS. I'M NOT SAYING THAT. BUT IT DOES -- THEY ARE VARIATIONS ON A THEME, YOU KNOW, THE ONES, THE NEW ONES THAT ARE THERE, YOU KNOW, AND PART OF THAT IS OUR CODE, YOU KNOW, IN TERMS OF WHAT WE ARE ASKING FOR, AND WE DON'T HAVE FORM BASED CODE EITHER, SO THAT'S PART OF HOW WE HAVE STRUCTURED OUR SYSTEM TOO. SO I GUESS I'M JUST PUTTING IT OUT THERE INTO THE WORLD FOR US TO PONDER SOME MORE.
01:17:54.911: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN: COMMISSIONER SAUVE?
01:17:56.712: >> COMMISSIONER SAUVE:  THANK YOU. MAYBE I'LL START KIND OF CONTINUING THAT CONVERSATION AND THEN GO TO SOME OTHER DETAILS. SO, WHEN LOOKING AT THAT CHARACTER OVERLAY DISTRICT, I WOULD SAY IN TERMS OF SMALL COMMERCIAL, WHEN I REVIEW THIS, WE ARE LOOKING AT 2500 SQUARE FEET AS KIND OF THE MAX AND 1500 SQUARE FEET AS THE MIN. I THINK ONE OF MY PREFERRED FAVORITE UNIT IS TENANT E, AS IT'S JUST GOT THE CORRIDOR BETWEEN BOTH SIDES. LIKE, IT WEDGES IN THERE AS ITS OWN KIND OF ISOLATED PIECE VERSUS B AND D, WHICH, LOOKING AT IT, THERE ARE WAYS TO SLICE THOSE UP INTO SEGMENTS AND TIE INTO THOSE CORRIDORS IF NECESSARY. I HAVE SEEN AND DONE IT BEFORE, SO YOU CAN HAVE D1 AND D2 AND B1 AND B2 FOR THOSE TENANTS, SO I FEEL LIKE THERE IS THAT POSSIBILITY, IF NECESSARY. BUT THE SMALL SCALE, WHEN WORKING ON SPACES LIKE THIS, IS ALMOST RELATIVE, LIKE MODERN BUILDING CODE WITH ACCESSIBILITY AND EGRESS DEMANDS REQUIRES MORE SQUARE FOOTAGE WITHIN USES FOR THAT, AND SO THE KIND OF ORIGINAL THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT, YOU KNOW, SMALL HOLE IN THE WALL IS NOT VERY FEASIBLE TO MEET ALL OF THOSE BUILDING REQUIREMENTS, SO CREATING THEM DOESN'T ACTUALLY OFFER THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET BUILD-OUTS COMPLETED AND PEOPLE TO MOVE IN, SO SMALL IS ACTUALLY RELATIVE TO WHAT THE BUILDING CODE WOULD REQUIRE. WHEN WE ARE LOOKING AT 2500 SQUARE FEET, IT'S ACTUALLY RELATIVELY SMALL WHEN YOU HAVE TO PUT IN THE BATHROOM AND THE EGRESS AND ALL OF THOSE THINGS. SO IT'S RIGHT AT THE EDGE OF IT, BUT IT'S HITTING KIND OF THAT SCALE.
01:19:34.977: >> WE CAN TAKE OUT ABOUT 200, ALMOST 400 SQUARE FEET JUST FOR BATHROOMS.
01:19:40.416: >> RIGHT, AND SO IF YOU GET INTO A KIND OF LARGER RESTAURANT, IT'S LIKE FOUR BATHROOMS, YOU KNOW, AND IT CAN REALLY TAKE UP A LOT OF SPACE. AND KIND OF THE OTHER POINT OF THE OVERLAY DISTRICT THAT I'M LOOKING AT IS MINIMIZING THE IMPACT ON THE ADJACENT RESIDENTIAL STREETS, AND THE DENSITY HERE, YOU KNOW, WE ARE TALKING A VARIETY OF SIZES, WE HAVE GOT R4C SOUTH AND ADJACENT TO IT, SO IF WE CAN PUT A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF UNITS HERE, RELIEVING SOME OF THAT DEMAND OF UNITS THAT WE COULD SEE A LOT MORE DEVELOPMENT OF R4C IN THE CHARACTER OF THOSE OLD HOUSES, I FEEL LIKE THAT'S PART OF THE PROTECTION OF WHAT CAN WE DO ON THIS STREET VERSUS HAVING IT TRICKLE INTO THE NEIGHBORHOODS. PART OF THIS OVERLAY DISTRICT IS TO LET THIS DISTRICT PROTECT THOSE NEARBY RESIDENTIAL STREETS, SO I THINK IT'S WEIGHING THOSE PROS AND CONS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THIS DISTRICT CAN DO AND HAS TO DO VERSUS THE OTHER. SO, LIKE I REALLY APPRECIATE MR. POTTS RAISING THIS AND KEEPING AN EYE ON THIS AS WE SEE PROJECTS GOING THROUGH WITH THIS, BUT THERE ARE, YOU KNOW, A VARIETY OF FACTORS WITHIN THAT TERRITORY TOO TO KIND OF BALANCE THEM OUT. SO, ESPECIALLY WITH THE KIND OF SMALL COMMERCIAL. FROM MY EXPERTISE, THAT'S KIND OF HOW I SEE IT WEIGHED, SO I'M JUST GOING TO PUT THAT OUT THERE AS MY REASON FOR SUPPORTING THIS PROJECT AS IT RELATES TO THAT OVERLAY DISTRICT. QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PROJECT, THERE'S THE ADDITIONAL TRANSFORMER AREA IF REQUIRED IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT WALKWAY.
01:21:14.710: >> YEAH. SO --
01:21:17.146: >> IT'S A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT LIKE PEDESTRIAN SPACE IF IT DOESN'T HAPPEN, OR EVEN IF IT DOES HAPPEN, SO I'M INTERESTED, SINCE IT'S IN BETWEEN TWO MORE NARROW PATHWAYS HOW THAT SPACE IS DESIGNED AND WHAT THAT EXPERIENCE IS, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO LIGHTING AND OVERHANGS.
01:21:34.897: >> SO, I CAN'T GIVE YOU THE EXACT ANSWER YET, BECAUSE WE ARE STILL WORKING WITH DTE ON EXACTLY WHAT IS REQUIRED. WE ARE WORKING ON AGREEMENTS WITH THE SIX PROJECTS TO THE SOUTH OF US. THEY HAD THEIR TRANSFORMER YARD, SO WE GET A TRANSFORMER IN THERE. AS IT STANDS RIGHT NOW, WE ARE GOING TO NEED AT LEAST TWO TRANSFORMERS THAT WE KNOW OF BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF THE BUILDING, THE BUILDING NEEDS ONE, THE FIRE PUMP NEEDS ONE. WE ARE STILL WORKING ON HOW MANY SWITCH CABINETS DO YOU NEED. DTE HAS GONE THROUGH AND COMPLETELY CHANGED HOW THEY SERVICE HIGH-RSE BUILDINGS, AND THIS IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE FIRST NEW BUILDINGS UNDER THEIR PROGRAM AND HOW THEY FEED IT. WE DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT YET. YOU TALK TO ONE PERSON, THEY TELL YOU ONE THING, YOU TALK TO ANOTHER PERSON, THEY TELL YOU ANOTHER THING, AND NOW WE THINK WE HAVE EVERYBODY THAT'S INVOLVED. SO ONCE WE KNOW EXACTLY THOSE REQUIREMENTS, YOU KNOW, MOST LIKELY THERE WILL BE A TRANSFORMER THERE OF SOME FORM THAT WILL BE BLOCKED AND SCREENED, JUST LIKE IT IS NOW BACK OVER THERE.
01:22:37.626: >> IS THIS THE MAXIMUM FOOTPRINT THAT WE WOULD BE LOOKING AT THAT'S PLANNED?
01:22:40.796: >> OF THE TRANSFORMER?
01:22:42.231: >> YEAH.
01:22:43.365: >> I THINK YOU'RE LOOKING AT THAT BECAUSE OF THE CLEARANCES THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE ON ALL FOUR SIDES TO SERVICE IT.
01:22:48.070: >> OKAY.
01:22:48.337: >> SO WE MAY NOT NEED THE GATE. I DON'T KNOW. JUST BECAUSE, AGAIN, THAT DEPENDS ON HOW THAT GETS ORIENTED AND HOW THEY CAN GET IN AND EVERYTHING ELSE, SO THERE'S STILL A LOT OF THAT THAT STILL HAS TO BE FLESHED OUT WITH DTE.
01:23:01.250: >> AND I GUESS BECAUSE IT'S STILL KIND OF A LARGE PEDESTRIAN AREA IN THE MIDDLE BETWEEN THOSE TWO AISLES, I WOULD BE INTERESTED, WITH OR WITHOUT THE TRANSFORMER AREA, IT'S STILL A LARGE FOOTPRINT FOR PEDESTRIANS TO USE. IF YOU COULD TELL ME, YOU MENTIONED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT LIGHTING.
01:23:13.429: >> OH, SO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW DO YOU WALK THROUGH.
01:23:15.531: >> YEAH, HOW DO YOU WALK THROUGH THE EXPERIENCE, SO PEOPLE ARE MINGLING BACK THERE, SMOKING, DUMPING GARBAGE OR MAKING OUT.
01:23:22.938: >> IT IS ALSO A SERVICE AREA, OBVIOUSLY, FOR THE BUILDING. IT IS BOTH FOR US AND FOR THE ADJACENT. SO I'LL GO WITH HOW WE SEE PEOPLE CURRENTLY. THEY REALLY DON'T CARE. I MEAN, TO BE HONEST, THEY WILL WALK THROUGH ANYWHERE THEY CAN GET A WAY THROUGH. THEY ARE GOING TO WALK. WE ARE GOING TO DO OUR BEST. THIS AREA ACTUALLY -- SO THIS IS ALL -- WHAT PART IS COVERED UNDER HERE? THE BUILDING FOOTPRINT COMES HERE, RIGHT?
01:23:46.529: >> YEAH, I THINK ALL OF THAT IS COVERED. IT'S BY THE PARKING SPOTS, IT'S OPEN, YEAH.
01:23:51.300: >> OKAY. AND THEN THAT GETS OPENED BACK.
01:23:53.068: >> AND THIS IS ALL --
01:23:54.203: >> OKAY.
01:23:54.670: >> AND THE SECOND FLOOR ACTUALLY STEPS IN.
01:23:57.907: >> OKAY. SO, I NEEDED TO UNDERSTAND IT BECAUSE I HAVE SEEN SO MANY DIFFERENT PLANS LATELY. SO, OBVIOUSLY, WE ARE GOING TO LOOK AT, YOU KNOW, LIGHTING. WE'LL HAVE CAMERAS BACK HERE AS WELL FROM A SECURITY STANDPOINT. LIKE I SAID, DEPENDING ON ULTIMATELY ONCE WE GET THROUGH ALL OF THE MECHANICAL EQUIPMENT AND VENTILATION AND WHAT IS A GRILL AND WHERE IS NOT A GRILL, WE'LL LOOK AT ADDING ART BACK THERE LIKE WE HAVE DONE AT OTHER LOCATIONS AS WELL. WHILE PEOPLE CAN WALK THROUGH THIS, THIS WILL PRIMARILY JUST BE LIGHTED. THE INTENT IS TO PROBABLY STILL BRING THEM THROUGH THIS WAY TO THE SOUTH, OVER ACROSS THIS WALK AS WELL. THE GOOD THING ABOUT THIS AREA HERE IS THERE IS NOT A HUGE AMOUNT OF TRAFFIC. WE HAVE FOUR CARS. THOSE ARE PRIMARILY MEANT FOR BUILDING MANAGEMENT PURPOSES, SO THEY ARE NOT COMING AND GOING ON A VERY QUICK BASIS, AND THEN PIZZA HOUSE, IT COMES IN AND GOES UNDERNEATH THEIR BUILDING, AND IT'S ONLY ONE WAY IN, SO THEY ONLY COME IN AND GO DOWN, AND THOSE ARE PERIODICALLY THROUGHOUT THE DAY. I KNOW WHEN WE DID OUR TRAFFIC STUDY, IT WASN'T A HUGE AMOUNT OF THEM COMING IN AND GOING OUT, SO WE CAN WORK ALONG WITH THEIR -- TRY AND CREATE DIRECTIONAL WAYS, PATHWAYS TO GET THROUGH THAT, BE IT ON THE WALK ITSELF AND DIRECTING PEOPLE OR CREATING SOME AVENUE, SO I DON'T WANT TO SAY I HAVE THE FULL ANSWER OF HOW THAT'S GOING TO BE DONE, BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT IDEAS, AND WE HAVE TO FULLY VET OUT WHERE DTE IS AT THE END OF THE DAY, WHERE ARE THEY AT AND EVERYTHING ELSE.
01:25:26.695: >> SO WHEN YOU SAY LIGHTING, IS IT UTILITY LIGHTING? WILL IT BE DESIGNED FEATURE LIGHTING?
01:25:34.336: >> IT WILL BE MORE OF DESIGNED FEATURE LIGHTING. WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE METRICS AND HOW THAT WILL DIRECT SOME OF WHAT WE HAVE ALONG THOSE PATHWAYS, SO I WOULD SAY YOU'RE LOOKING AT MORE LIKE A UTILITY L.E.D. LIGHT ALONG HERE JUST TO KEEP IT NICE AND BRIGHT. ALONG HERE...  (SPEECH AWAY FROM MICROPHONE).
01:25:56.458: >> YEAH, THAT WOULD BE MY NEXT QUESTION, TO PROTECT FOR THAT MIDDLE AREA.
01:26:02.364: >> WE DIDN'T HAVE BALLARDS BECAUSE OF THE DISTANCE THAT WE HAD TO MAINTAIN FOR THE SIDEWALK AND FOR THE INGRESS THAT WAS REQUIRED FOR THE AGREEMENT THAT WE HAVE ALSO WITH THE ADJACENT PROPERTY OWNER AS WELL. SO THOSE WOULD PROBABLY BE MORE DECORATIVE, BECAUSE WE DO HAVE OPTIONS ALONG THE BUILDING TO CREATE MORE DECORATIVE THERE, WHEREAS HERE WHEN YOU HAVE ONLY A SHORT PATHWAY, YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO KEEP IT FOR SOMETHING TO LIGHT IT UP.
01:26:31.927: >> YEAH, AND BOLLARDS, BECAUSE I DON'T SEE ANYTHING KIND OF BLOCKING EVEN PAST THAT TRANSFORMER. I'M THINKING, YOU KNOW, ELECTRICS, MOTORCYCLES AND THINGS CAN ACTUALLY SCOOT ALL THE WAY THROUGH THAT RIGHT NOW. YOU CAN GET THROUGH BOLLARDS WITH A SMALL SCOOTER TOO.
01:26:48.711: >> YEAH, WE'LL WORK WITH MCI IN FIGURING OUT EXACTLY WHERE THOSE HAVE TO GO, OBVIOUSLY, BECAUSE LIKE I SAID, ONCE WE KNOW WHERE DTE IS AT, WHAT EQUIPMENT IS BACK THERE, ARE THERE THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO FURTHER PROTECT AS WELL. YOU HAVE YOUR TRASH ROOM HERE, AND FOR US COMING OUT, TRYING TO HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF BOLLARDS, IT'S GOING TO BE A PROBLEM WITH CITY SERVICES AND THOSE THINGS AS WELL.
01:27:18.006: >> MY NEXT QUESTION IS FOR THE RAILING ON THE PATIOS ON THE THIRD FLOOR, IN THE RENDERINGS, THEY SHOW ALL THE WAY ACROSS, AND HOW I'M READING THE PLAN, THERE'S ROOF OVERHANG LABELS, AND THEN BALCONIES, AND THE BALCONY PATIO ISN'T THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THAT BUILDING FACADE.
01:27:44.633: >> IS THIS THE AREA?
01:27:46.034: >> YEAH, SO ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ENTRY, THE RAIL LINES RUN KIND OF THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE STOREFRONT ON EITHER SIDE, BUT WHEN I LOOK AT THE PLAN, THERE'S KIND OF ROOF OVER LEVEL TWO AND THEN LINE DRAWN AND THEN PATIO 3.
01:28:08.223: >> SO ACTUAL PATIOS, LIVING UNITS, LIVING ROOMS, BUT THE RAILING COULD RUN ALL THE WAY ACROSS TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE IT IS ALL A PATIO, BUT WE DIDN'T WANT TO PUT PATIOS IN FRONT OF BEDROOMS.
01:28:19.201: >> SO IS THE ROOF FINISHED DIFFERENTLY THERE THAN THE PATIO AREA?
01:28:22.871: >> YEAH, A ROOF FINISH VERSUS A PATIO --
01:28:26.942: >> SO TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE, SO ON THE NORTH PROJECT, SO YOU HAVE MULTIPLE UNITS ACROSS THE FRONT. YOU MAY HAVE THREE ACROSS THE FRONT. SO THEY WILL HAVE AN AREA WHERE IT'S THE PEDESTALS, THE RAILINGS, REGULAR ROOF, SO THE PEDESTAL WILL SIT UP EIGHT, NINE INCHES, BUT THEN THE ROOF IS DOWN EIGHT, NINE INCHES, AND SO IT'S REGULAR ROOF, SO --
01:28:48.630: >> I'M JUST IMAGINING LIKE EVERYBODY LINED UP ALONG THE RAILING (SIMULTANEOUS SPEECH) --
01:28:54.136: >> WE DON'T ALLOW THAT ALL THE WAY ACROSS. WE SPECIFICALLY HAVE THOSE PATIOS, AND THEY ARE NOT LIKE (SIMULTANEOUS SPEECH) --
01:29:01.443: >> I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY WHEN I'M LOOKING AT ELEVATION VERSUS PLAN THAT THOSE ARE IN SYNCH. (SPEECH AWAY FROM MICROPHONE) I THINK MY LAST ONE GOT ANSWERED, WHICH WAS WHAT WAS THE INTENDED USE FOR THE OVERHANG IN THAT RETAIL AREA. THAT IS FOR THE RETAIL AND TRYING TO BLOCK THAT OFF. I WOULD KIND OF REINFORCE COMMISSIONER BRIGGS'S COMMENTS ABOUT THE DESIGN IN THAT -- I MEAN, WE HAVE SEEN IT AT THE CORNER OF MAIN AND HURON, THE SAME KIND OF COLUMNS AND SETBACK FOR AN ENTRANCE. IT DOES SOMETHING. I DON'T THINK IT'S THE SUCCESSFUL STATEMENT OF A PIECE THAT'S BEEN KIND OF SAID HERE, AND SO I THINK THERE'S DEFINITELY -- I WOULD -- I WOULD REQUEST SOME MORE --
01:29:52.027: >> SO I HAVE A QUESTION, AND THIS IS THE CONFUSING PART THAT WE HAVE. OBVIOUSLY, WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE DESIGN REVIEW PROCESS.
01:29:58.901: >> YEP.
01:29:59.301: >> AND SO THAT PROCESS IS MAINLY FOCUSED ON THE DESIGN ASPECTS OF THE BUILDING. WE COME BACK, AND NOW THERE ARE ADDITIONAL DESIGN CHANGES THAT ARE WANTED. I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THAT PROCESS, BECAUSE --
01:30:13.515: >> I DON'T THINK THESE ARE CHANGES THAT ARE -- THAT WE HAVE ANY CONTROL OVER. THIS IS JUST TO --
01:30:18.954: >> I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND, DO WE HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE DESIGN REVIEW --
01:30:23.158: >> NO, THIS IS A REALLY STRONG SUGGESTION.
01:30:27.029: >> YES. WE MIGHT TALK ABOUT BROWN BRICK LATER. [ LAUGHTER ].
01:30:32.701: >> WE WILL.
01:30:33.235: >> I'LL LEAVE THAT. BUT, YEAH, EVEN IN TERMS OF -- YEAH, THE ART IN THE ALLEYS AND KIND OF WHAT HAPPENS HERE IS A STATEMENT. I THINK MOVING IT FORWARD, WE WANT THIS -- YOU WANT IT TO BE A SUCCESSFUL PROJECT.
01:30:49.151: >> SO HERE'S A QUESTION. DO YOU HAVE SUGGESTIONS? BECAUSE WE ASKED THE DESIGN REVIEW BOARD, AND THEY DON'T REALLY GIVE US A LOT OF SUGGESTIONS. SO THAT'S THE CHALLENGING PART THAT WE HAVE. WE HEAR SOMETHING. WE TAKE THAT BACK. WE HAVE APPLIED IT THE BEST WE THINK IT APPLIES. YOU SAY WE THINK YOU CAN DO MORE. DO YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS, BECAUSE I DON'T WANT US TO GO BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD AND THEN COME BACK AND COUNCIL SEES SOMETHING AND THEY ARE LIKE WAIT A SECOND. SO, YOU KNOW --
01:31:14.710: >> I MEAN IT'S HARD TO MAKE DESIGN RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE FLY FOR THIS THING.
01:31:18.447: >> EVEN IF YOU WANT TO EMAIL US, YOU CAN EMAIL US.
01:31:21.316: >> YEAH, BUT I THINK IT ALSO FEELS LIKE A COUPLE OF PIECES THAT WERE, YOU KNOW, SOLVING THE COLUMN, AND THEN PLUGGING LIGHT IN, RIGHT? THEY ARE OBJECTS PLACED INSTEAD OF CONSIDERED IN CONTEXT OF THE FACADE AND THE REST OF THE KIND OF GROUND FLOORING, WHAT IT'S WORKING WITH, SO THAT IS WHAT I THINK I'M MORE REACTING TO, IS I FEEL LIKE COMPONENTS AND INTEGRATED DESIGN TO THE FACADE AND HOW IT WORKS AS A STATEMENT. AND, YEAH, AND THESE ARE MORE JUST KIND OF PREFERENCES AT THIS POINT BUT NOT REQUIREMENTS OR RECOMMENDATIONS TO MOVE FORWARD. BUT THE -- YEAH, SO THOSE I THINK ARE MY MAIN CONCERNS AT THIS POINT. THANK YOU.
01:32:00.455: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN: COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN.
01:32:04.693: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN:  THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR. I THINK MOST OF WHAT I HAD HAS BEEN COVERED. I THINK ULTIMATELY I APPRECIATE THAT THIS IS COMING FORWARD UTILIZING THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING PREMIUM THAT WE HAVE ON THE BOOKS. IT'S BEEN A DECADE, AND IT'S NICE TO SEE SOMETHING MOVE FORWARD. IT'S MY HOPES THAT NEW PREMIUM REFORMS WILL GO THROUGH CITY COUNCIL, AND THIS MAY BE THE FIRST AND THE LAST OR THE FIRST AND THE PENULTIMATE TO UTILIZE THIS VERSION. BUT WHO KNOWS? I ALSO SEE THE NEED FOR INCREASED DENSITY IN THE NEAR-CAMPUS AREA. IN THE LAST 15 YEARS, THE UNIVERSITY HAS INCREASED ITS ENROLLMENT BY 10,000, AND WITH PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT AND THE CONSTRUCTION OF NEW DORMS, WE STILL SEE A SIGNIFICANT SHORTAGE OF BEDROOMS TO THE NET INCREASE OF STUDENTS, WHICH IS SHOCKING AT THE RATE OF DEVELOPMENT THAT WE HAVE SEEN, BUT THAT'S JUST THE NATURE OF A GROWING UNIVERSITY THAT DOES NOT QUIT. AND WE NEED TO HOUSE THESE STUDENTS, AND IF WE DON'T HOUSE THEM NEAR CAMPUS, THEY ARE GOING TO BE CHEWING UP SINGLE-FAMILY HOMES, WHICH, AS I HEAR FROM RESIDENTS, ISN'T DESIRED EITHER. AND SO I THINK THIS IS BEST. I APPRECIATE THAT IT'S MIXED USE. I APPRECIATE THAT THERE ARE RETAIL OPPORTUNITIES. I WILL ALSO ADD MY COMMENTS ABOUT THE CORNER. I THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE THE COMMERCIAL ENTRANCE TO THE CITY. I THINK ACROSS THE STREET YOU STILL HAVE THE HISTORIC ESPRESSO ROYALE THAT ADDS A LITTLE BIT MORE CHARACTER AND DIFFERENTIATION TO THAT CORNER. OTHER THAN THE SCHOOL OF SOCIAL WORK, YOU HAVE HISTORIC, YOU HAVE -- YOU HAVE THE DORM, I'M BLANKING ON ITS NAME. IS THAT MARTHA COOKE? AND THEN WEST HALL, THE ICONIC OLD ENGINEERING BUILDING. AND I THINK WHAT WEST HALL DOES REALLY WELL, IT'S A REDDER BRICK. IT ALSO HAS A LOT OF CURVED ARCHWAYS WITH SQUARE WINDOWS, SO YOU HAVE A LOT OF RIGHT ANGLES HERE. I MEAN, IT'S ENTIRELY RIGHT ANGLES, AND SEEING SOMETHING BREAK THAT UP MIGHT BE INTERESTING, AND I THINK IT ALSO COULD CREATE A REALLY GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR THAT RETAIL STALL AT THE CORNER FOR SOMETHING KIND OF FLAGSHIP AND ICONIC, SOMETHING FOR YOUR COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE BROKER TO REALLY WORK WITH AND DO SOMETHING SIGNIFICANT AND MEANINGFUL AS PEOPLE EXPERIENCE ANN ARBOR FOR THE FIRST TIME, MATRICULATING IN. I'LL ALSO SAY THAT WEST HALL, YOU KNOW, HAS THE REALLY RED BRICK. IT HAS THE CAST STONE, AND IT ALSO HAS THE REALLY AGED COPPER, AND I THINK ALL OF THOSE PROBABLY OFFER SOME KIND OF CONTEXT THAT YOU COULD REFERENCE IN YOUR ARCHITECTURE, SOMETHING THAT WOULD REALLY TRY TO DRAW THOSE TWO SIDES OF THE CORNER TOGETHER IN AN INTERESTING WAY. I'LL SAY, TOO, YOU KNOW, MR. HUGHES, SHAWN, YOU GUYS ARE THE CLOSEST THING WE HAVE TO LOCAL DEVELOPERS WHEN IT COMES TO STUDENT HOUSING DOWNTOWN, AND IF SOMEONE IS GOING TO TAKE A RISK ON ARCHITECTURE, I THINK IT CAN BE YOU GUYS.
01:35:34.069: >> I'M TRYING TO GET BILL KENLEY HIS CLOCK THAT HE WANTS.
01:35:38.506: >> SO, YOU KNOW, I THINK IF EVERYONE SAYS IT'S SUBJECTIVE AND WE ARE NERVOUS, WE ARE GOING TO GET A LOT OF RIGHT ANGLES, WE ARE GOING TO GET A LOT OF BROWN BUILDINGS, AND I THINK THERE IS SOME OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE SMALL RISKS TO DO SOMETHING MUCH MORE INTERESTING IN REFERENCE TO WEST HALL, SO I'LL LEAVE IT THERE.
01:35:57.359: >> I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS. I THINK THAT HELPS GIVE US A LITTLE BIT MORE -- YOU KNOW, BECAUSE AGAIN, WITH DESIGN REVIEW, WE TRY TO ASK SOME QUESTIONS OF, OKAY, WHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE? AND IT WAS LIKE, OKAY, KIND OF I AM STILL NOT SURE, BUT, OKAY.
01:36:13.708: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN: COMMISSIONER MILLS?
01:36:14.609: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  I DON'T TOTALLY KNOW WHAT THE COMMENT ABOUT THE CLOCK WAS, BUT, HONESTLY, IN MY MIND, A CLOCK WOULD BE BETTER THAN THE V. HONESTLY. LIKE, IN TERMS OF A LANDMARK, THE V IS UNDERWHELMING. IT DOES NOTHING FOR ME PERSONALLY. BUT I ALSO LIKE EVERYTHING THAT COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN JUST SAID. LIKE, YEAH, THAT WOULD BE AWESOME. OTHER THINGS THAT I HAVE SOMEWHAT COVERED BUT MOSTLY ON THAT FIRST FLOOR AGAIN, THE STAFF REPORT TALKS ABOUT TWO TO FOUR RETAIL SPACES. I SEE THREE TO FIVE, SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE UNDERSTANDING, IT IS THREE TO FIVE?
01:36:53.548: >> YES.
01:36:53.982: >> OKAY. GREAT.
01:36:56.718: >> MATT FORGOT HIS CALCULATOR.
01:36:59.220: >> FORGOT OFF TO THE SIDE. THAT'S KIND OF WHAT I ASSUMED. BECAUSE YOU DO HAVE THIS EXPERIENCE, I WANT YOU TO TALK TO ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW OFTEN BIKE ROOMS ARE USED.
01:37:11.533: >> YOU KNOW, IT VARIES. RIGHT NOW, NOBODY HAS REALLY USED ANY OF IT AT NORTH. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S JUST BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN WRAPPING THINGS UP AND PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO PUT THEIR BIKES IN THERE JUST YET. YOU KNOW, WITH LANDMARK, IT'S HARD TO SAY, BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY SOLD THAT BUILDING TWO WEEKS AFTER WE HAD FINISHED IT, SO I'M NOT QUITE SURE HOW MUCH THAT BIKE ROOM IS ACTUALLY UTILIZED THERE, SO I CAN'T ACTUALLY SAY. I THINK IT'S HIT OR MISS. YOU HAVE PEOPLE NOWADAYS THAT USE LYFT, AND NOW WITH THE INVENT OF THE SPIN SCOOTERS THAT EVERYBODY DRIVES ON THE SIDEWALKS THAT THEY ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO, YOU SEE A LOT OF THAT GOING BACK AND FORTH. WITH WHERE WE ARE LOCATED AT AS WELL, A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE JUST WALKING TO THEIR CLASSES BECAUSE OF THE PROXIMITY THAT WE DO HAVE, SO IT IS HARD TO SAY, BECAUSE YOU ARE SEEING A LOT OF THAT CHANGING MORE AND MORE WITH THE DEMOGRAPHIC OF THE STUDENTS THAT ARE ACTUALLY IN NOWADAYS, SO I UNFORTUNATELY DON'T HAVE A FULL ANSWER TO BE ABLE TO GIVE YOU HOW MUCH IS UTILIZED AND HOW MUCH IS NOT. SO --
01:38:16.364: >> GOT IT. I DON'T KNOW. THAT'S LIKE IF I HAVE TIME, SOMETIME, I'M GOING TO GO AROUND AND FIGURE OUT WHAT THOSE LOOK LIKE. I WANT --
01:38:23.571: >> I WOULD APPRECIATE IT.
01:38:25.040: >> WELL, NO, SO I WANT IT THERE. I'M NOT GOING TO -- LIKE, I APPRECIATE THAT YOU HAVE A SPACE. GIVEN THE PREVIOUS CONVERSATION, I NOW KIND OF HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF WHAT'S COVERED IN THE BACK, HOW OPEN IT IS, AND WHAT'S NOT. I WAS REALLY AFRAID THAT IT WAS LIKE VERY NARROW. I'M STILL A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS, PARTICULARLY ABOUT THAT FIVE-FOOT WIDE SECTION ON THE WEST SIDE TO, YOU KNOW, IF I'M COMING IN WITH A -- I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG THAT STRETCH IS, YOU KNOW. I MEAN, GETTING THROUGH WITH A BIKE, I -- IF IT WERE ME, RIGHT, LIKE I WOULD PROBABLY USE THE -- OR THE VEHICLE LANE THAT YOU HAVE ON THE EAST SIDE TO GET OUT, BECAUSE IT'S JUST MORE OPEN.
01:39:16.224: >> OH, ON THE OTHER SIDE.
01:39:17.926: >> ON THE OTHER SIDE.
01:39:20.128: >> BIKE ROOMS ARE KIND OF SPLIT RIGHT NOW TOO, SO THAT COULD GET TWEAKED OBVIOUSLY AS WE TALK MORE WITH DTE. IF THEY ARE ON ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER, THAT WOULD HELP.
01:39:31.272: >> ONE THING THAT STRIKES ME, AGAIN, THIS IS NOT IN OUR CODE ANYWHERE, BUT HOW EASY IT IS TO PARK A CAR TO GET INTO THE BUILDING, AN APARTMENT, VERSUS HOW EASY IT IS IF YOU PARK A BIKE TO GET IN, WHICH IT IS NOT. LIKE, HOW MANY DOORWAYS DO YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH TO GET TO AN ELEVATOR OR A STAIRWAY? A LOT, RIGHT? AND SO THAT'S NOT -- THAT'S NOT FACILITATING. THAT'S NOT -- AGAIN, THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT OUR CODE REQUIRES, BUT MY GUESS IS THAT IF THEY ARE UNDERUTILIZED, THIS MAY BE ONE OF THE REASONS. I THINK IT IS MUCH MORE OPEN THAN AT LEAST ON THE PLAN I ANTICIPATED, SO I'M LIKE -- BUT I'M STILL LIKE -- I'M WORRIED THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO GET UTILIZED, AND THEN PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SAY, SEE, WE DON'T NEED BICYCLE INFRASTRUCTURE, WHEN, IN FACT, IT'S JUST BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE TO GO OUTSIDE AND THROUGH MULTIPLE DOORS AND WALK AROUND, AND SO -- YEAH.
01:40:35.370: >> I THINK I COULD AGREE IF THIS WAS MORE OF A MARKET RATE APARTMENT COMPLEX IN DOWNTOWN, BUT WITH STUDENTS, THEY ARE A TOTALLY DIFFERENT BEAST, A TOTALLY DIFFERENT BEAST.
01:40:46.981: >> WELL, THIS IS EXACTLY WHY I THINK INSTEAD, GETTING TO THE EARLIER COMMENTS, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A WHOLE BUNCH, YOU SAID IT YOURSELF, CHAIN TO TREES ON THE FRONT. AND THAT'S NOT WHAT WE WANT TO SEE.
01:40:57.959: >> IF I COULD PUT MY BIKE THERE, I WOULD BE HAPPY ABOUT THAT.
01:41:02.163: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  SO, YEAH. IT MEETS OUR CODE. I APPRECIATE THAT IT'S THERE. I APPRECIATE THAT YOU'RE GOING ABOVE AND BEYOND. I WISH IT WERE BETTER INTEGRATED, THAT JUST LIKE THERE IS A DIRECT ACCESS FROM THAT PARKING GARAGE INTO THE UNIT, YOU HAVE TO GO OUTSIDE THIS WAY, RIGHT? AND SO I WISH THAT WERE HERE, BUT I THINK IT'S MORE OF US KIND OF FOOD FOR THOUGHT AND MAYBE FOOD FOR THE NEXT TIME WE HAVE THE BUILDINGS COME BEFORE US. BUT, OVERALL, I THINK WHAT OTHER PEOPLE SAID, THIS IS THE RIGHT PLACE FOR DENSITY. THIS DOES TAKE PRESSURE OFF OF SOME OF THE NEARER NEIGHBORHOODS THERE. I THINK THAT -- I'M CONFIDENT THAT THE CORNER CAN BE IMPROVED AND THAT YOU GUYS HAVE SOME MAYBE IDEAS NOW. I'M HAPPY THAT THERE ARE THREE TO FIVE RETAIL SPACES, BECAUSE I THINK THE MORE KIND OF DIVERSITY THAT WE HAVE, THE BETTER, BUT I ALSO -- I APPRECIATE SOMEBODY WHO DESIGNS THESE PLACES TAMPERING OUR EXPECTATIONS IN THAT REGARD, SO, THANKS.
01:42:20.008: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN: COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT.
01:42:23.311: >> I THINK MOST OF WHAT I WAS GOING TO ASK WAS ADDRESSED AS WELL, EXCEPT I'M GOING TO BE A BROKEN RECORD ABOUT THIS ALLEY. I HAVE A THING FOR ALLEYS. I LOVE THEM. I THINK THEY ARE A PUBLIC SPACE THAT CAN BE UTILIZED IF DONE IN A WAY THAT MAKES SENSE DESIGN WISE. I THINK THE TRANSFORMER BOX DOES KIND OF GET IN THE WAY, BUT I'M JUST TRYING TO THINK OF WHAT GETS DONE BECAUSE IT IS A WEIRD SPACE. I CAN'T ACTUALLY VISUALIZE THE EXPERIENCE OF WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE GOING THROUGH THIS. I WORRY THAT PEOPLE WOULD FEEL UNSAFE, AND OBVIOUSLY THE GARBAGE ROOM IS BACK THERE. I WISH I HAD A BETTER PICTURE OF WHAT THE SECTION WOULD LOOK LIKE THROUGH THAT ALLEYWAY, BUT I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT WHAT YOU COULD PUT IN THERE, SUGGESTIONS IN TERMS OF SEATING BACK THERE, PRIMARILY IN THIS AREA THAT COMES OUT OF THE BUILDING THAT'S RIGHT BEHIND THE PARKING RAMP AREA OR THIS IS KIND OF CRAZY, BUT MAYBE EVEN SOME SORT OF LIKE WATER FEATURE. I MEAN, IT'S A LOT OF SPACE BACK THERE, AND I THINK THERE'S NOT REALLY ANY OTHER OPEN SPACES THIS BUILDING CAN USE, SO, YOU KNOW, I LIKE THE ARTWORK IDEA. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE SOUTH ELEVATION, IT'S JUST ALL WALLS, SO THEY JUST SCREAM TO ME THAT SOMETHING COULD BE DONE THERE, AND THEN I'M JUST THINKING OF LIKE -- I'M ACTUALLY THINKING OF SPECIFICALLY BUILT ALLEY IN DETROIT, BUT THE OVERHEAD STREAM LIGHTS COULD MAKE THE EXPERIENCE SOMETHING YOU WANT TO WALK INTO. I THINK ON THE EAST SIDE, IT'S RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET FROM RICK'S MAYBE AND SOME OTHER RESTAURANT RETAIL, SO PEOPLE MIGHT ACTUALLY BE ACCESSING IT THAT WAY, AND JUST MAKING IT FEEL LIKE THIS IS AN ENTRANCE AND NOT SOME SCARY BACK OF A BUILDING I THINK WOULD HELP. SOMETHING COMMISSIONER MILLS WAS JUST SAYING MADE ME LOOK AT THE BIKE STORAGE ROOM A LITTLE BIT MORE. SO YOU CAN ONLY GO IN AND OUT ONE WAY. THERE'S NO ENTRANCE FROM THE BIKE STORAGE ROOM INTO THE BUILDING. YOU HAVE TO GO BACK OUTSIDE. AM I LOOKING AT THIS RIGHT? OKAY. I ALSO DON'T LOVE THAT. I KIND OF AGREE WITH YOU, THAT WHY WOULD PEOPLE DO THAT. YEAH. BUT YOU STILL HAVE TO GO BACK OUTSIDE. AND THEN JUST ONE OTHER THING, BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY YOU CAN ACCESS THE BUILDING FROM THE CORRIDOR, SO LIKE IF YOU LIVE THERE, GOING IN THERE, THAT'S A GOOD BENEFIT, BUT THESE JUST LOOK LIKE, YOU KNOW, VERY LONG PASSAGEWAYS BACK TO A DOOR WHERE YOU CAN GET TO STAIRS. I MIGHT ENCOURAGE SOME SORT OF LIKE MURALS ON THOSE WALLS TOO OR SOMETHING TO MAKE IT -- AGAIN, LIKE YOU'RE WALKING DOWN THIS VERY LONG HALLWAY, MAKE IT A NICER EXPERIENCE FOR PEOPLE WHO MIGHT BE ACCESSING IT FROM AN ALLEY. DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?
01:44:58.599: >> ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT INTERIOR OR EXTERIOR?
01:45:01.135: >> INTERIOR. I WOULD POINT AND SHOW YOU, IF I COULD.
01:45:03.938: >> YEAH. THE ONE CAVEAT THERE IS THESE ARE A LOT OF TIMES USED BY SERVICE CORRIDORS. IF I PUT A MURAL UP, IT'S GOING TO GET DESTROYED.
01:45:14.682: >> OKAY. MAYBE JUST BRIGHT PAINT THEN.
01:45:16.317: >> BRIGHT PAINT, BUT I'M GOING TO BE PAINTING IT A LOT, TRUST ME, BASED ON EXPERIENCE.
01:45:21.222: >> MURAL ON THE CEILING.
01:45:22.457: >> MURAL ON THE CEILING, CLOUDS, LIKE WHEN YOU'RE IN THE DENTIST OFFICE.
01:45:26.994: >> I DON'T HAVE ANY DATA TO BACK THIS UP, BUT IF IT FEELS LIKE A SPACE THAT IS LESS LIKE A SERVICE CORRIDOR, PEOPLE MIGHT TREAT IT BETTER. TOTALLY UP TO YOU. IT MIGHT BE WORTH PILOTING.
01:45:40.208: >> IT WOULD REALLY BE A PILOT.
01:45:45.179: >> I FORGET WHAT STUDENTS ARE LIKE, I GUESS. I THINK THAT'S ALL I HAVE.
01:45:50.785: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN: COMMISSIONER WOODS.
01:45:53.888: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS:  JUST A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS THAT I WONDERED. ONE IS WILL EACH OF THE BEDROOM UNITS THEN HAVE A WINDOW?
01:46:01.262: >> YEAH, THEY ARE REQUIRED BY CODE TO HAVE A WINDOW.
01:46:03.798: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS:  OKAY. GOOD. THERE WERE TIMES WHEN WE WEREN'T SO SURE THAT WAS HAPPENING, SO I JUST WANTED TO DOUBLE-CHECK.
01:46:08.769: >> IS THAT A BUILDING CODE AS WELL?
01:46:11.072: >> IT IS. IT IS IN OUR ZONING CODE. I KNOW THAT. (SIMULTANEOUS SPEECH) --
01:46:15.309: >> YEAH, I THINK BUILDING REQUIRES IT AS WELL.
01:46:18.212: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS:  GOOD. AND THEN ARE YOU DOING ANYTHING GREEN WITH THIS BUILDING? HAVE I MISSED IT, LIKE A GREEN ROOF, ANYTHING?
01:46:23.284: >> NO, WE ARE NOT. WE ARE NOT DOING GREEN.
01:46:27.288: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS:  MISSED OPPORTUNITY, I GUESS.
01:46:36.063: >> I CAN'T COMMIT TO --
01:46:37.064: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS:  SO WHAT'S ON THE TOP OF THE ROOF? MECHANICS AND STUFF?
01:46:42.904: >> YEAH, MECHANICAL.
01:46:44.639: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS:  IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE SOMETHING GREEN UP THERE. THANK YOU FOR THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WE APPRECIATE THAT, BUT WE ALSO LIKE GREEN THINGS TOO. AND DID YOU INDICATE THAT THE LANDSCAPING IS ALL GOING TO BE A PART OF WHATEVER THE DDA IS DOING IN THAT AREA?
01:47:01.589: >> YEAH, SO, I FORGOT WHAT ALL PARKS REQUIRE, BUT, YEAH, PRIMARILY EVERYTHING IS WHAT THE DDA HAS REQUESTED AS PART OF THE CITY STREET SCAPES OR WHAT WE HAD TO DO ON THE EAST U AND CHURCH.
01:47:15.937: >> AND I CAN JUST ADD IT IS ON THE SITE PLAN AS WELL ON DETAILED SHEETS AND AS WELL AS IN THE DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT, AND THEY HAVE WORKED IT OUT WITH DDA IN ADVANCE. (SIMULTANEOUS SPEECH) --
01:47:28.583: >> I THINK THERE HAVE BEEN FIVE DIFFERENT APARTMENTS THAT HAVE TALKED ABOUT THAT.
01:47:31.586: >> IT'S COVERED.
01:47:35.656: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS:  ALL RIGHT. GOOD.
01:47:38.793: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN: COMMISSIONER ABRONS.
01:47:39.794: >> COMMISSIONER ABRONS:  I'LL JUST MAKE A COUPLE OF BRIEF COMMENTS. I THINK WE WERE KIND OF KINDLY REQUESTED TO PROVIDE SOME EXPLANATION FOR THE WAY IN WHICH WE WERE GOING TO VOTE, SO I WAS GOING TO TAKE THAT REQUEST SERIOUSLY. I THINK THIS PROJECT IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF ONE WHERE I FEEL THAT I HAVE TO VOTE IN FAVOR OF THE PETITION BECAUSE IT MEETS ALL OF THE REQUIREMENTS, BUT I THINK THAT ALL OF THE COMMENTS ARE EVIDENCE THAT THE REQUIREMENTS ARE SUBSTANDARD, RIGHT, SO THAT A PROJECT CAN MEET THOSE REQUIREMENTS AND YET I THINK LEAVE US KIND OF WANTING FOR SO MUCH MORE, AND MAYBE JUST TO OFFER ONE MORE PERSPECTIVE ON WHY MAYBE THE DESIGN FEELS LIKE IT COULD BETTER --
01:48:18.899: >> ARE WE TALKING SPECIFICALLY THE CORNER?
01:48:21.035: >> I'M TALKING ABOUT THE WHOLE THING, I GUESS, AT THIS POINT, WHICH IS JUST TO SAY THAT I UNDERSTAND THAT FROM A DEVELOPMENT PERSPECTIVE, THERE IS NO INCENTIVE TO TAKE A RISK, AND SO I THINK WHAT WE SEE BEFORE US IS SOMETHING WHICH IS KIND OF NICE WITHIN THE STANDARDS OF WHAT'S KNOWN AND FAMILIAR AND PROVEN TO WORK, BUT MAYBE ONE WAY THAT WE COULD THINK ABOUT THAT IS THAT YOU COULD KIND OF PICK THIS BUILDING UP AND PROBABLY PLACE IT ANYWHERE, AND IT WOULDN'T -- IT WOULD CHANGE VERY, VERY LITTLE, WHICH IS TO SAY THAT THERE IS NOTHING THAT HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY CONSIDERED IN ITS DESIGN THAT IS I THINK CARING FOR THE CHARACTER OF ITS SITE AND ITS LOCATION. AND I'M KIND OF SHOCKED. I'M SOMEWHAT NEW TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION, SO TO A CERTAIN EXTENT, IT'S INTERESTING FOR ME TO OBSERVE THE WAY IN WHICH THE PROJECT CAN KIND OF MEET ALL OF ITS LEGAL REQUIREMENTS AND STILL HAVE SO MANY THINGS THAT WE ALL WISH IT COULD HAVE, THAT WE CAN ONLY OFFER MERELY AS SUGGESTIONS OR PREFERENCES, BUT I'M SURPRISED THAT THE CHARACTER OVERLAY REQUIREMENT FOR THE OFFSET ABOVE THE STREET WALL IS FIVE FEET. RIGHT? SO, THE CHARACTER OVERLAY IS SUPPOSED TO MAINTAIN THIS KIND OF TWO-STORY -- THE KIND OF VIBE OF A TWO AND THREE-STORY STREETSCAPE, AND THE WAY IT DOES THAT IS BY HAVING THIS OFFSET, BUT THE OFFSET IS ONLY FIVE FEET, SO, IN EFFECT, YOU GET A BUILDING THAT FEELS LIKE IT IS 11, 13 STORIES HIGH, NOT TWO STORIES HIGH, SO I DON'T KNOW IF MAYBE AT SOME POINT THE CHARACTER OVERLAY SHOULD BE REVISITED. SO, AND THEN MAYBE JUST AS ONE LESS THING, IN REGARDS TO ALLEYS, JUST IF YOU'RE INTERESTED, THERE'S A PROJECT IN NASHVILLE THAT WAS COMPLETED MAYBE ONLY A YEAR AGO BY A SMALL ARCHITECTURE PRACTICE CALLED SPORTZ, THE LAST LETTER IS A Z, I THINK, NOT AN S, SO SPORTZ WITH A Z, BUT THEY DID A PROJECT FOR REVITALIZATION IN NASHVILLE THAT MIGHT BE NICE TO CHECK OUT THAT INVOLVES BRIGHT GREEN SEATING. THANKS.
01:50:31.365: >> ALL RIGHT. I HAVE A LIST OF QUESTIONS, AND THEN WE'LL HEAD BACK TO SOME OTHER COMMISSIONERS. SO, AFFORDABLE HOUSING, WHERE IS THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING GOING TO BE LOCATED IN THE BUILDING?
01:50:43.010: >> I THINK WE ARE STILL DISCUSSING WHICH UNITS WOULD BE THE AFFORDABLE UNITS. BUT IT WAS DISCUSSED WITH THE COUNTY AT ONE POINT THAT THEY WOULD LIKE THAT DISPERSED THROUGHOUT THE BUILDING AND NOT JUST ALL ON ONE FLOOR AND THAT THE RESIDENTS OF THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING OF COURSE WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO THE SAME AMENITIES, AND ALTHOUGH IT WASN'T MENTIONED, THE SAME BUILDING ENTRANCE, BECAUSE I GUESS IN SOME COMMUNITIES THAT IS NOT THE CASE. SO, 14 UNITS AND IT HAS NOT BEEN DETERMINED WHICH UNITS YET.
01:51:19.513: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  I WOULD ENCOURAGE THAT THEY BE DISPERSED THROUGHOUT THE BUILDING, NOT JUST ONE FLOOR OR ONE STYLE OF UNIT BUT DISPERSED THROUGHOUT THE BUILDING. AND I GUESS MY NEXT QUESTION IS HOW BIG ARE THOSE UNITS GOING TO BE.
01:51:30.357: >> A MINIMUM OF 600 SQUARE FEET, MAYBE 625. IT'S HARD TO SAY EXACTLY.
01:51:37.097: >> IT REQUIRES A MINIMUM --
01:51:38.899: >> 600 SQUARE FEET.
01:51:41.101: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  VERY GOOD. THEN IN REGARDS TO -- SO LET'S TALK ABOUT PARKING. SO, WE ARE SEEING MANY PROJECTS IN THE DOWNTOWN AREA GOING TO THE CITY'S AND THE DEA'S PARKING STRUCTURES TO GET ADDITIONAL PERMITS, AND I GUESS THIS IS MORE OF A QUESTION FOR STAFF. THEN WE HEAR THE DDA AT THE LAST -- WITH THE ANN STREET PARKING STRUCTURE SAYING WE ARE OUT OF SPACE, SO HOW ARE THEY GOING TO GET 41 SPACES WHEN I KNOW THAT THE DDA IN SOME PARKING STRUCTURES CURRENTLY HAS A MULTIYEAR WAITING LIST?
01:52:25.112: >> I CAN ACTUALLY ANSWER THAT QUESTION. SO, BASED UPON NORTH, THERE ARE NO PARKING SPACE LEFT IN FOREST STRUCTURE. WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO GO GET PARKING. WE MAY BE ABLE TO GET EVENING PASSES, WHICH IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DID ON NORTH, BUT PRIMARILY WE'LL BE USING THE CONTRIBUTION IN LIEU ASPECT.
01:52:46.367: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT, WHAT IS THE CONTRIBUTION IN LIEU, HOW MUCH.
01:52:53.274: >> I FORGET WHAT THE AMOUNT IS.
01:52:55.809: >> I WANT TO SAY 50 SOMETHING, SOMETHING LIKE THAT I THINK.
01:52:58.746: >> IS IT PER SPOT?
01:53:00.114: >> YEAH, IT'S PER SPOT. IT'S PER SPACE. I WANT TO SAY IT'S AROUND 55, I THINK, SOMEWHERE IN THERE, A 55 CONTRIBUTION TO THE PARKING SYSTEM. I BELIEVE IT'S TO THE DDA AND IT GETS PUT INTO THE PARKING SYSTEM.
01:53:13.894: >> YES, IT IS, CORRECT.
01:53:16.864: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  IT WOULD BE GREAT TO KNOW THAT NUMBER, NOT THAT THIS WILL AFFECT MY VOTE.
01:53:21.535: >> I WANT TO SAY OFF THE TOP 55 IS WHAT IT IS, BUT I COULD BE WRONG.
01:53:26.573: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  AND I HAVE ASKED YOU THIS QUESTION BEFORE, AND ANYTIME ANYBODY COMES WITH A CAMPUS PROJECT TO US, I ASK THIS QUESTION, AND THAT IS THE SUPPLY DEMAND. YOU KNOW, I AM SURE YOU HAVE CRUNCHED YOUR NUMBERS BEFORE YOU'VE STARTED THIS PROCESS, BUT CAN YOU TALK TO US A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND AND WHAT YOU'RE SEEING AND LIKE WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE NORTH AND WHAT YOUR EXPECTATIONS ARE FOR THE SOUTH.
01:53:48.896: >> SO WE ARE FULLY RELEASED UP AT NORTH. I BELIEVE YOU MAY HAVE ONE OR TWO BEDS AVAILABLE, BUT IT'S NOT BECAUSE OF PEOPLE NOT COMING IN, JUST BECAUSE OF WE DON'T HAVE ANY MALE BEDS LEFT. WE HAVE FEMALE BEDS LEFT, SO WE HAVE QUITE A BIT OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE ACTUALLY COME IN THIS WEEK STILL LOOKING FOR SPACES FOR THE UPCOMING YEAR. SO YOU'RE STILL SEEING THE DEMAND OUT THERE. OBVIOUSLY AS YOU WELL KNOW, LOCATION IS EVERYTHING, VIC NORTH, VIC SOUTH I BELIEVE BY FAR HAVE THE BEST LOCATIONS OF ANYWHERE DOWNTOWN.
01:54:18.726: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  THAT'S WHAT ALL OF THE DEVELOPERS SAY.
01:54:20.828: >> WELL, YES, BUT IN REGARDS TO PROXIMITY OF ACTUAL TO CAMPUS, I THINK THOSE TWO HAVE IT. SO ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE CHANGED THE ONES, TWOS, THREES AND FOURS IS WE SEE THAT DEMAND STILL HIGHLY OUT THERE FOR THOSE TYPES OF UNITS. THE FIVES AND SIXES, WE WERE ABLE TO LEASE. WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY PROBLEMS WITH THOSE, BUT YOU STILL SEE THE HIGH DEMAND FOR ONES, TWOS, THREES, AND FOURS, AND SO THAT'S WHY THOSE UNITS ARE ONES, TWOS, THREES, AND FOURS, TO MAKE THEM MORE MARKETABLE IN THE MARKET THAT WE ARE SEEING OUT THERE. COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN HAD NOTED AS WELL, THE UNIVERSITY IS STILL ADDING STUDENTS, BUT THEY ARE NOT ADDING A WHOLE LOT OF BEDS, SO THERE IS STILL A GREAT DEAL OF DEMAND STILL OUT THERE I BELIEVE STILL IN THE DOWNTOWN AREA.
01:55:05.105: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  AND THEN WHAT'S NEXT FOR YOU GUYS, SINCE YOU OWN ANOTHER BLOCK OR TWO?
01:55:08.809: >> RIGHT NOW, I WAS WORRIED ABOUT GETTING NORTH COMPLETED, AND WE ARE NOW WORKING ON SOUTH AND WE'LL WORRY ABOUT WHAT ELSE IS OUT THERE. SO WE ARE TRYING TO GET A RESTAURANT THAT USED TO BE THERE. RIGHT NOW THAT'S GOING TO OASIS. WE ARE DOING A FACADE RENOVATION FOR THE TENANTS THAT ARE THERE. THE NEXT ONE WOULD BE TO MOVE TO THE EAST SIDE, WHICH IS WHERE MIDDLE EARTH USED TO BE AT WHAT WE PLAN TO DO ON THAT, WE DON'T HAVE IT FULLY VETTED OUT, OBVIOUSLY, BECAUSE WE HAVE GOT TO SEE WHERE THE MARKET IS AT, WHAT DEMAND IS THERE AS WELL.
01:55:46.280: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  GREAT. AND THEN SO THE OTHER PIECE, JUST TO -- YOU KNOW, I HAVEN'T DRIVEN ON SOUTH U IN SO LONG, JUST BECAUSE IT'S BEEN UNDER CONSTRUCTION SINCE PROBABLY FOR YEARS NOW AT THIS POINT, BETWEEN --
01:55:58.258: >> AND IT WILL PROBABLY BE FOR SOME MORE YEARS.
01:56:04.031: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT CONSTRUCTION TIMELINE? BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IN A LONG TIME THAT THERE HASN'T BEEN CONSTRUCTION ON SOUTH U.
01:56:11.305: >> SO WE ARE FINISHING UP THAT NORTH STREET SCAPE WORK THERE RIGHT NOW, SO I BELIEVE WE HAVE TO BE COMPLETED BY THE END OF NEXT WEEK IN CONVERSATIONS WITH CITY ENGINEERING AND EVERYTHING, SO BY THE END OF NEXT WEEK, WE SHOULD HAVE ALL OF THAT IN THERE. DDA MAY STILL HAVE SOME OF THE WORK THAT THEY HAVE TO DO, COMING IN, DOING THE PLANTINGS AND THINGS ALONG THOSE LINES THAT THEY HAVE TO DO. THIS PROJECT, WE PROBABLY WOULD BE BREAKING GROUND SOMETIME IN THE SPRINGTIME, WHERE WE WOULD BE DOING MORE OUT IN THE STREET AGAIN AS WE WOULD. WE'LL OBVIOUSLY FENCE IT OFF AS WE DO DEMOLITION AND SOME OF THE EXCAVATION AND EVERYTHING TOO, AND WE ARE WORKING THROUGH THE LOGISTICS OF HOW DO YOU LOGISTICALLY GET IN WHEN YOU'RE DEMOING AND EXCAVATING TWO STORIES DOWN, ROUGHLY, AND HOW DO YOU GET THAT OUT OF THE SITE AS WELL, SO WE ARE STILL WORKING THROUGH ALL OF THOSE REQUIREMENTS. SO THAT'S WHERE THIS IS LOOKING AT, AND I BELIEVE THE COMPLETION DATE WOULD BE 2022.
01:57:03.590: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  OKAY. AND THEN IN REGARDS TO DESIGN, SO I CHALLENGE YOU, AND MAYBE IT'S NOT THIS PROJECT, MAYBE IT'S THE NEXT ONE, BROWN BRICK.
01:57:13.634: >> BROWN BRICK?
01:57:14.334: >> I TALK ABOUT THIS ALL THE TIME. THE CITY IS TURNING BROWN, AND IT'S EVERY PROJECT THAT WE ARE SEEING, DIFFERENT TONES OF IT, AND SOUTH U HAS A LOT OF CHARACTER THAT'S GOING AWAY, YOU KNOW, FUNKY CHARACTER, AND IT'S BECOMING THIS BLOCK. SO I REALLY CHALLENGE YOU AND YOUR ARCHITECTS DOWN THE ROAD TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT'S UNIQUE, THAT'S MAYBE NOT ALL BROWN. I APPRECIATE THAT THIS PROJECT HAS MORE GLASS AND THAT YOU'RE INTRODUCING MORE GLASS TO IT, BUT I THINK WE NEED TO STRIVE TO DO A LITTLE BIT BETTER IN THIS CITY. OBVIOUSLY, NOTHING THAT WE HAVE CONTROL OVER, BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT I -- YOU KNOW, YOU GUYS ARE AS CLOSE TO LOCAL DEVELOPERS AS IT GETS, SO I ASK THAT YOU TRY THAT FOR YOUR NEXT PROJECT. JUST AS, YOU KNOW, AT THIS POINT IT MIGHT BE TOO LATE, BUT FOR ME, YOU KNOW, JUST THAT CORNER ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE DIAG, JUST REMOVING THAT COLUMN, AND I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S FEASIBLE. I'M NOT AN ARCHITECT.
01:58:13.260: >> IT'S A STRUCTURAL COLUMN.
01:58:14.394: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  I AM SURE THERE IS A WAY. I AM SURE. BUT I'M NOT AN ARCHITECT, SO I CAN'T -- IT IS WHAT IT IS, BUT THAT WOULD BE THE ONLY THING THAT I WOULD ADD TO IT OR THE THING THAT I WOULD SUBTRACT IN ORDER FOR IT TO BE MORE ATTRACTIVE IN MY OPINION, AND WITH THAT, I WILL HEAD TO COMMISSIONER BRIGGS.
01:58:36.783: >> COMISSIONER BRIGGS:  THE ONE THING THAT DIDN'T GET BROUGHT UP, THERE WAS A LOT OF DISCUSSION OF LIGHTING, ESPECIALLY IN THE ALLEYWAY. ONE THING THAT YOU MAY OR MAY NOT BE AWARE OF IS THAT WE ARE WORKING ON UPDATING OUR LIGHTING ORDINANCE, AND WHILE IT'S NOT IN THERE YET ABOUT DARK SKIES COMPLIANT, IF YOU COULD MAKE EVERY ATTEMPT TO BE COGNIZANT OF LIGHT POLLUTION AND TO --
01:58:55.869: >> YEAH, WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE REPEATING SOME OF THE STUFF ON NORTH WHERE WE HAVE UPLIGHTS AND EVERYTHING ELSE, SO, YEAH, WE'LL BE LOOKING AT THAT AND THE IMPACT OF HOW THAT ORDINANCE FLESHING OUT AND HOW IS THAT APPLIED DOWN IN THESE AREAS AS WELL.
01:59:07.281: >> OKAY. AND THEN THE OTHER THING THAT JUST GOT BROUGHT UP, I THINK I UNDERSTOOD WHAT YOU WERE SAYING, BUT I GUESS IT DID RAISE A QUESTION FOR ME, THE FEEDBACK THAT YOU HAD GOTTEN FROM THE COUNTY IN TERMS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING WAS MAKING SURE THAT IT WAS DISPERSED THROUGH THE BUILDING AND NOT A SEPARATE ENTRANCE. I ASSUME THAT YOU WERE SAYING THAT THAT IS WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IN THIS BUILDING AS WELL, NOT THAT THAT WAS STILL UP FOR DEBATE?
01:59:32.806: >> CORRECT, YEAH. YOU CAN'T DO SEGREGATED. WE WOULDN'T BE DOING SEGREGATED.
01:59:41.882: >> COMISSIONER BRIGGS:  I WASN'T SURE. I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE. GREAT.
01:59:44.384: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN: COMMISSIONER MILLS?
01:59:46.553: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  THANK YOU, AND ONE OF YOUR QUESTIONS ABOUT PARKING ALSO HAS ME WONDERING, YOU HAVE NOTED THAT YOU'LL, YOU KNOW, BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE 71 SPACES HERE UNDERGROUND, BUT THEN THERE WILL BE THIS PAYMENT IN LIEU FOR THE BALANCE. HOW DO YOUR TENANTS FEEL ABOUT THAT? DO THEY WANT TO BRING CARS AND DON'T HAVE THEM? CAN YOU SHARE WITH US YOUR EXPERIENCE?
02:00:14.147: >> SO, WITH NORTH, YOU SAW -- I MEAN, YOU SAW SOME PEOPLE WHO SAID, WELL, I'M NOT GOING TO RENT THERE BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE A CAR. YOU SAW SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE LIKE, YEAH, I'M FINE WITH THE EVENING PASSES. THERE ARE OTHER LOCATIONS WITHIN THE AREA WHERE THEY WERE ABLE TO FIND PARKING IF THEY REALLY, REALLY WANTED PARKING, BUT OVERALL, WE HAVEN'T SEEN IT BE TOO MUCH OF A DETRIMENT OF NOT HAVING A CAR FOR EVERY PERSON OR WHATNOT, AND YOU TYPICALLY DON'T SEE THAT ANYWAYS. I KNOW WITH LANDMARK, EVEN THOUGH WE HAD SOLD THAT, FROM TALKING WITH MANAGEMENT THERE THAT WE HAD KEPT IN CONTACT WITH, EVEN THEIR PARKING STRUCTURE WASN'T UTILIZED FULLY A HUNDRED PERCENT WITH CARS WITH THE SPACES THAT THEY HAD DOWN THERE AS WELL. I KNOW WHEN YOU LOOK AT -- I KNOW IT'S NOT STUDENT HOUSING, BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE ONE THAT -- IT'S ON 1st AND -- THE ONE --
02:01:05.098: >> 1st AND WASHINGTON? COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN ANN ARBOR CITY APARTMENTS.
02:01:11.972: >> CITY PLACE I THINK.
02:01:13.039: >> OH, ON FOURTH?
02:01:13.907: >> YES, THE ONE DOWN THERE, WITH PUBLIC UNDERNEATH IT THAT THEY DID WITH DDA, YEAH, CITY CLUB. FROM WHAT WE HEARD, THEY DON'T EVEN USE ALL OF THE PARKING SPACES THAT THEY HAVE FOR THEIR RESIDENTS TOO, SO YOU ARE SEEING THE SHIFT, OBVIOUSLY, AGAIN, WITH THE INVENT OF UBER AND LYFT AND DOWNTOWN AND EVERYTHING, YOU'RE SEEING THAT CHANGE, SO WE HAVEN'T REALLY SEEN IT BE -- OBVIOUSLY, AS WE ARE FULLY LEASED UP, WE HAVEN'T SEEN IT AS AN ISSUE.
02:01:48.975: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  THE 41 SPOTS THAT YOU WILL HAVE TO ENTER INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH WITH THE DDA, WHICH WON'T BE PROVIDED THERE, BECAUSE THERE'S NO SPACE LEFT IN THE STRUCTURE, IT WON'T BE PROVIDED THERE, YOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT THIS IS HINDERING YOUR ABILITY TO RENT OUT THIS PLACE?
02:02:04.157: >> NO.
02:02:04.391: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  OKAY. I THINK THAT'S KIND OF HELPFUL TO PUT IT INTO CONTEXT ABOUT HOW MUCH PARKING IN THESE, YOU KNOW, VERY CLOSE TO CAMPUS AREAS --
02:02:12.499: >> LET ME SAY, THOUGH, HOWEVER, THAT IS DIFFERENT THAN THE PARKING IN GENERAL FOR PEOPLE COMING AND VISITING IN THE DOWNTOWN AREA, TWO TOTALLY DIFFERENT THINGS, BUT FROM A RESIDENTIAL STANDPOINT, WE ARE NOT SEEING IT AS A DETRIMENT. NOW, AS SOMEBODY WHO HAS BEEN ON THE SOUTH AREA ASSOCIATION AND SERVED AS A PRESIDENT, TOTALLY DIFFERENT VIEWPOINT, YES, THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE PARKING FOR PEOPLE IN THE DOWNTOWN AREA TO COME AND VISIT. I HAVE BEEN HERE EVEN COMING DOWN TO MAYNARD STREET AND COMING TO A CONCERT, THANKFULLY I HAVE A PARKING SPACE BECAUSE THE PARKING STRUCTURE IS FULL, BUT TWO TOTALLY DIFFERENT STRUCTURES, YES.
02:02:53.840: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  DOES THAT FACTOR INTO ALL OF THE RETAIL SPACE? THE PARKING EFFECTIVELY, DOES THAT COME UP?
02:02:59.679: >> SOME OF THE RETAIL TENANTS, YES. WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO WORK WITH THEM THROUGH OPTIONS, BUT OVERALL, IT HASN'T BEEN TOO MUCH OF A DETRIMENT WITH THE PEOPLE THAT ARE COMING INTO THE BUILDING THAT WE HAVE SEEN SO FAR.
02:03:10.891: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  GOT IT. THANKS FOR SHARING THAT.
02:03:15.529: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN: COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN.
02:03:17.597: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN:  THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR. MR. KOWALSKI, IS THERE A PROCESS, IF WE WERE TO -- I GUESS I -- IF WE WERE TO VOTE THIS FORWARD TONIGHT BUT WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT PETITIONER WORKED WITH STAFF ON SOME KIND OF STREETSCAPE ELEVATION CHANGES, IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WOULD NEED TO COME BACK TO PLANNING COMMISSION BEFORE MOVING TO COUNCIL? WOULD YOU RECOMMEND THAT IT DO?
02:03:41.454: >> I WOULDN'T NECESSARILY, BECAUSE IT WOULD BE HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE AT THAT POINT FOR US, FOR STAFF TO MAKE THAT DETERMINATION THAT THIS MEETS YOUR, YOU KNOW, WHAT YOU GUYS ARE KIND OF GOING, AND WE HAVE HEARD A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT. I MEAN, I HAVE HEARD YOUR CONVERSATIONS HERE.
02:03:59.339: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN: RIGHT.
02:04:00.140: >> BUT I THINK ULTIMATELY WHEN IT GETS TO CITY COUNCIL, THEY CAN MAKE CHANGES WITHOUT IT COMING BACK TO THIS BOARD. THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT. THEY CAN MAKE SOME OF THESE CHANGES OR MAKE MODIFICATIONS. I MEAN, WE CAN -- THE STAFF OBVIOUSLY WILL LOOK AT IT AND MAKE SURE IT STILL COMPLIES WITH THE STANDARDS AND ALL OF THAT KIND OF STUFF, BUT IT WOULD BE MORE OF KIND OF A JUDGMENT CALL AT THAT POINT, WHETHER OR NOT WE THINK THIS ADDRESSES, MOVE THE COLUMN REMARK, IT'S A DIFFICULT CALL.
02:04:31.972: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN:  SO YOU'RE RECOMMENDING THAT IT COME BACK TO PLANNING COMMISSION?
02:04:36.109: >> I'M NOT SAYING THAT. I'M SAYING IF THE DESIGN IS THAT IMPORTANT, YOU MIGHT WANT TO HAVE THE DESIGN FLESHED OUT BEFORE IT MOVES FORWARD. WE CAN CERTAINLY MAKE THOSE CHANGES AND WE CAN LOOK AT THAT AND WE CAN MAKE A DETERMINATION ON THAT, BUT I WOULDN'T WANT TO SPEAK FOR THE WHOLE OF THE COMMISSION.
02:04:49.723: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN:  YEAH, CERTAINLY.
02:04:51.424: >> IN SAYING WHETHER THIS ADDRESSES YOUR CHANGES. BY CODE, IT WOULDN'T BE REQUIRED TO COME BACK HERE.
02:04:56.429: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN:  OKAY.
02:04:57.664: >> UNLESS YOU POSTPONE IT, I GUESS.
02:05:00.500: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN: UNDERSTOOD. SO I GUESS I'LL DEFER TO COLLEAGUES, SIMPLY BECAUSE EITHER WAY I'LL GET TO SEE IT AGAIN, SO, REALLY, I WOULD DEFER TO YOU ALL AND YOUR JUDGMENT.
02:05:13.713: >> ONE OTHER COMMENT, TOO, BECAUSE THEY JUST MENTIONED IT, THE DRB ACTUALLY MADE A COMMENT ABOUT HAVING THAT COLUMN THERE, TOO, SO, AGAIN, THAT'S THE ISSUE THAT --
02:05:27.661: >> WITH THAT BEING A TENANT SPACE, THEY ARE WORRIED ABOUT A BIG STARBUCKS LOGO AS THE FIRST THING THAT YOU SEE WHEN YOU COME OUT OF THE DIAG, SO THEY WANTED US TO PUT A PERMANENT BUILDING FEATURE THAT YOU WOULD FOCUS ON, RATHER THAN THE TENANT SPACE THAT'S RIGHT THERE.
02:05:43.510: >> CAN YOU VERIFY THAT THAT WAS THE DRB MEETING, AND THAT WAS A DECISION POINT BACK AND FORTH ABOUT MOVING SOMETHING THERE OR OPENING UP THAT SPACE, THAT'S CORRECT.
02:05:55.555: >> I AM SURE STARBUCKS WOULD PAY A LOT OF MONEY FOR THAT.
02:05:58.491: >> WE'LL MAKE IT A STARBUCKS CLOCK.
02:06:01.861: >> NOW YOU'RE TALKING. [ LAUGHTER ].
02:06:11.237: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN: COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT.
02:06:18.878: >> ONE MORE THING. SOUND PROOFING, FROM LIKE SOUND MITIGATION IN BETWEEN THE UNITS. I DON'T KNOW IF PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THE WAITING LIST FOR AFFORDABLE UNITS -- CAN THEY OPT OUT? PROBABLY, RIGHT? I DON'T KNOW IF I WOULD WANT TO LIVE IN A BUILDING FULL OF STUDENTS, BUT THAT JUST MADE ME THINK WHAT OTHER KINDS OF THINGS ARE YOU DOING IN TERMS OF THE BUILDING AND NOT BEING ABLE TO HEAR LOUD MUSIC COMING FROM THE PERSON NEXT DOOR.
02:06:44.804: >> THAT COMES TO SOMEWHAT OF MANAGEMENT, BUT OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE INSULATION THAT GOES IN BETWEEN THE WALLS AND THOSE ASPECTS THERE. SO WE HAVEN'T HEARD OF ANY ISSUES BETWEEN A UNIT AND A UNIT OR ANYTHING, BUT IF SOMEBODY IS PLAYING LOUD MUSIC, THAT BECOMES A MANAGEMENT ISSUE. WE WERE ACTUALLY TALKING WITH A TENANT WHO WAS BELOW A UNIT THAT IS BEING CONSIDERED THE PARTY UNIT, NOW THAT WE ARE FINDING, AND SHE'S LIKE, YEAH, WE CAN HEAR THEM IF THEY DROP SOMETHING OR EVERYTHING, AND THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT WHERE THEY WERE GETTING A LITTLE BIT LOUD, BUT THEY TOLD MANAGEMENT AND MANAGEMENT WAS ABLE TO HANDLE IT. SO YOU CAN ONLY DO SO MUCH TO SOUND DAMPEN IT, BUT THERE IS GOING TO BE NOISE NO MATTER WHAT, AND IT GOES TO MANAGEMENT IF THERE IS NOISE. THAT IS HANDLED BY THE MANAGEMENT AND IS IN THE LEASE DOCUMENTS. YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE A NOISY BUILDING. THOSE ARE SOME OF THE LESSONS THAT WE LEARNED FROM WHEN WE DID LANDMARK AND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE DID DIFFERENTLY TOO.
02:07:42.529: >> I HAVE LIVED IN PLACES WHERE I FELT LIKE THERE WAS CARDBOARD BETWEEN THE WALL.
02:07:46.466: >> WE PUT SPECIFICALLY SOUND BAT BETWEEN THE MICING WALLS AND THE CORRIDOR WALLS AND EVERYTHING TOO.
02:07:53.306: >> GREAT. THANK YOU.
02:07:55.208: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN: COMMISSIONER BRIGGS?
02:07:59.312: >> COMISSIONER BRIGGS:  I AM NOT SURE I FEEL COMFORTABLE SUGGESTING POSTPONING FOR IT TO COME BACK TO US, SO I THINK I UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S DIFFICULT TO TAKE THIS FEEDBACK AROUND DESIGN. I THINK YOU HAVE HEARD IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN, THOUGH, FROM DIFFERENT BODIES, AND THE NEXT BODY YOU GO TO IS THE ONE THAT SEEMS TO BE -- HAVE THE MOST INTEREST IN NEIGHBORHOOD CHARACTER IN THE COMMUNITY RIGHT NOW, SO I THINK IT'S MAYBE WORTH YOUR TIME TO REALLY THINK ABOUT HOW THIS INTERFACES, AND I THOUGHT THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN GAVE WERE AT LEAST VERY MUCH IN LINE WITH THINGS I THOUGHT MADE A LOT OF SENSE AND CHARACTER TO DRAW UPON AND THINGS THAT YOU COULD SAY THAT YOU WERE DRAWING UPON. SO, THOSE ARE MY THOUGHTS ON THAT QUESTION.
02:08:45.158: >> AND THOSE ARE VERY HELPFUL COMMENTS THAT WE CAN TAKE BACK AND IMPLEMENT, SO --
02:08:51.865: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  MY FEELING IS THAT WE MOVE FORWARD ON THIS THIS EVENING. THIS IS OUT OF OUR PURVIEW AT THIS POINT, SO I DON'T SEE A REASON TO STOP. ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION? ARE WE READY FOR A VOTE? ALL RIGHT. ALL OF THOSE IN FAVOR, PLEASE SAY AYE. [ CHORUS OF AYES ] OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. THANK YOU. NEXT ITEM ON OUR AGENDA IS AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION. THIS IS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR ANYBODY IN THE AUDIENCE TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION. YOU WILL HAVE UP TO THREE MINUTES TO SPEAK ON ANY SUBJECT YOU WOULD LIKE. IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION, PLEASE STEP FORWARD. STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS FOR THE RECORD.
02:09:39.913: >> ETHEL POTTS AGAIN. I SHOULD HAVE SAID WHEN YOU WERE DEALING WITH THE HIDEAWAY LANE THAT WHEN IT HAD BEEN BEFORE COMMISSION BEFORE, WHEN IT WAS AN ISSUE IN THE PAST, THE BIGGEST SINGLE PROBLEM WAS THE WATERWAY. THERE WAS GREAT DIFFICULTY KEEPING IT UNDER -- HAVING IT UNDER CONTROL, DEALING WITH IT, DEALING WITH RUNOFF, EVERYTHING THAT WOULD RELATE TO AN OPEN WATERWAY NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT AGAIN. IS IT IN BETTER SHAPE, IN WORSE SHAPE? WHAT ARE THE PLANS? THANK YOU.
02:10:13.313: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  THANK YOU.
02:10:24.390: >> I'LL BE REAL BRIEF. I REPRESENT KEN BRYANT, WHO IS THE OWNER OF MEDICINE MAN ANN ARBOR, WHICH IS A MEDICAL MARIJUANA PROVISIONING CENTER HERE IN ANN ARBOR THAT IS STATE LICENSED. MAYBE SOMEBODY CAN ANSWER THIS QUESTION FOR ME AFTER THE MEETING, BECAUSE I'M JUST KIND OF GETTING INVOLVED WITH THE LOCAL CODES AND THINGS. SO, FOR THE SEUs, I'M UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE 28 ISSUED FOR MEDICAL MARIJUANA PROVISIONING CENTERS. KEN CURRENTLY HAS ONE OF THOSE BUT HE'S BEING -- HE'S GOT PROBLEMS WITH THE LANDLORD, SO HE'S BEING FORCED TO RELOCATE, AND HE IS NEXT IN THE QUEUE, BUT I HAVE GONE THROUGH ONLINE AND FOUND A COUPLE OF THEM THAT, YOU KNOW, THEY WERE APPLIED FOR YEARS AGO, AND NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE ON THESE. I'M WONDERING AT WHAT POINT DO SOME OF THESE, YOU KNOW, EITHER GET DENIED OR SOMEBODY ELSE GETS A CHANCE, YOU KNOW, TO COME TO THE TABLE. WHAT IS THE PROCESS ON THAT? YOU KNOW, HOW LONG DO THEY GET? YOU KNOW, IS IT A STATE LICENSING ISSUE, LIKE THEY ARE WAITING FOR THE STATE LICENSES? I'M NOT REALLY SURE THAT I WOULD AGREE THAT THAT WOULD BE FAIR. I MEAN, KEN HAS GOT A PLACE LICENSED. HE'S READY TO GO. I FEEL LIKE SOMETHING IN TERMS OF GETTING THESE EITHER APPROVED OR DENIED, YOU KNOW, THEY SHOULDN'T BE TAKING YEARS, IS ALL PRETTY MUCH WHAT I'M SAYING, SO MAYBE IF SOMEBODY COULD SHED SOME CLARIFICATION ON THAT FOR ME, I WOULD VERY MUCH APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU.
02:11:46.906: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  AND I'M SURE MR. KOWALSKI WILL BE HAPPY TO ADDRESS THAT SHORTLY AFTER THE MEETING. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION? SEEING NO ONE, MOVING ON TO COMMISSION PROPOSED BUSINESS. THE ONLY THING I WOULD JUST LIKE TO DISCUSS VERY BRIEFLY, AND I DON'T THINK THIS IS IN OUR PURVIEW IS THE LYFT AND UBER SITUATION THAT WE HAVE IN THE CITY, AND I HAVE NOW SEEN MANY CITIES NO LONGER ALLOW PICKUPS AND DROP-OFFS ON MAJOR ROADWAYS, LIKE MAIN STREETS AND SOME VERY BUSY ROADS, SO I WOULD ASK THAT COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN MAYBE TAKE THIS BACK TO COUNCIL OR WHOEVER, WHICHEVER COMMISSION IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS, BUT THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT FOR SOUTH UNIVERSITY, HURON, MAIN STREET, AND SOME OF OUR MAJOR ROADS. SO, COMMISSIONER BRIGGS?
02:12:43.763: >> COMISSIONER BRIGGS:  JUST TO ADD TO THAT, I THOUGHT THE COMMENT AROUND AMAZON WAS ACTUALLY ALSO REALLY USEFUL. I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW MANY AMAZON DELIVERIES THEY GET EVERY SINGLE DAY, AND THAT HAS GOT TO BE -- IT'S SOMETHING WE WOULD NEED TO PLAN FOR IN DOWNTOWN.
02:13:00.913: >> ACTUALLY, ON THEIR FLOOR PLANS, THEY HAVE AMAZON DROP BOXES. IF YOU COULD SEE IT ON THEIR FLOOR PLANS, THEY HAVE LARGE AREAS SET ASIDE SPECIFICALLY FOR AMAZON, WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT WE WOULDN'T HAVE THOUGHT OF A COUPLE OF --
02:13:14.760: >> NOW THERE ARE INDEPENDENT DELIVERY VEHICLES TOO, AND THERE HAS BEEN SOME QUESTION. ANYWAY, THERE'S A WHOLE LOT THERE. THE SECOND THING THAT I FEEL LIKE WE SPEND JUST A TON OF TIME ON, PROBABLY UNNECESSARILY SO, REPETITIVELY, IS BIKE PARKING IN THE DOWNTOWN, ABC, AND I THINK THAT IF THERE IS A WAY FOR MAYBE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION TO GET -- TAKE A LOOK AT THOSE REQUIREMENTS OR SOME SORT OF INTERFACE BETWEEN PLANNING AND TRANSPORTATION, TO TAKE A LOOK TO SEE IF THOSE SORT OF -- OUR REQUIREMENTS ARE IN LINE WITH OUR NEEDS. I THINK WE JUST -- WE TALK ABOUT IT QUITE A BIT.
02:13:58.037: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN: COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN?
02:13:58.971: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN:  THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR. I WANTED TO GIVE A QUICK PLUG TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ORDINANCE COMMITTEE IS FOCUSING ON AND MAYBE PUSHING STAFF A LITTLE BIT AROUND SHORT-TERM RENTAL REGULATION. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS A BIG IMPACT ON NEIGHBORHOODS, ON COMMUNITY BUILDING AND ON AFFORDABILITY. WE ARE SEEING A LOT OF HOMES BEING PURCHASED UP AND ESSENTIALLY TURNED INTO HOTELS, WHICH REALLY RUNS COUNTER TO A LOT OF BOTH THE BEST PRACTICES AND THE PHILOSOPHIES IN OUR CONVERSATIONS AROUND THE SUPPLY OF HOUSING FOR PEOPLE WHO LIVE HERE. AND SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S ON THE WORK PLAN, BUT I JUST WANTED TO GIVE A PLUG FOR THAT TO KEEP THE MOMENTUM UP. IT'S A COUNCIL DIRECTIVE, SO I PROMISED A COLLEAGUE I WOULD GIVE THAT PLUG, BUT IT'S FROM ME
