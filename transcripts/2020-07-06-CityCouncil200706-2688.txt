00:03:06.798: >> City Admin. Crawford: THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.
00:03:08.534: >> Mayor Taylor: DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY OBJECTION TO US ROLLING IN PUBLIC COMMENT? IF SHE ROLLS IN, WE WILL PUT HER IN IN THE MIDST OF PUBLIC COMMENT. DO THAT SEEM GOOD TO EVERYONE? ALL RIGHT. SO THAT'S WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO. DR. JACKSON, IF YOU CAN HEAR US, -- AS SOON AS YOU GET ON. IN THE MIDST OF PUBLIC COMMENT. MEANWHILE, WE HAVE NOW COME TO PUBLIC COMMENT GENERAL TIME. PARDON ME, PUBLIC COMMENT RESERVE TIME. IT'S A OPPORTUNI FOR MEMRS OF THE PUBLIC TO SPEAK TO COUNCIL AND THE PUBLIC ABOUT MUNICIPAL INTERESTS. TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT RESERVE TIME, ONE NEEDS TO HAVE SIGNED UP IN ADVANCE, BY CONTACTING OUR CITY CLERK. TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT, IF YOU ARE LISTED, PLEASE CALL 877-853-5247, THAT IS 7-855247, AND ENTER THE MEETING ID97465979811. THIS NUMBER SHOULD APPEAR ON YOUR SCREEN. SPEAKERS HAVE THREE MINUTES IN WHICH TO SPEAK. PLEASE PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO OUR CLERK WHO WILL LET YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE AT THE 30 SECOND POT. OUR FIRST SPEAKER -- WHEN YOU HAVE REACHED THREE MINUTES, MS. BEAUDRY WILL LET YOU KNOW AND YOUR TIME WILL BE UP. OUR FIRST SPEAKER TONIGHT IS GLEN ZIEGLER.
00:04:43.228: >> OKAY. I'M GLEN ZIEGLER. I LIVE IN THE OLD WT SIDE. I LIVE ABOUT FOUR HOUSES DOWN FROM THE 415 WEST WASHINGTON STREET YOU ARE CONSIDERING TONIGHT. I WILL CUT TO THE CHASE. I BELIEVE THE PROPOSAL YOU GOT BEFORE YOU TO PREENTITLE 170 UNITS OF DEVELOPMENT AT THIS SITE IS PRETTY FLAWED. IN A MINUTE, I WILL GET INTO THOSE FLAWS. I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT EN BROUGHT FORWARD BY AEARBYS NEIGHBOR WHO LIVES WITHIN A BLOCK OF THE SITE AND ALSO HAS A BUSINESS WHICH ABUTS THE SITE. AND HE'S PROPOSING TO REDEVELOP THE EXISTING STRUCTURES AT THE SITE, FOR SOME NEIGHBORHOOD AND PEDESTRIAN-FRIENDLY USES LIKE FARM MARKETS, COFFEE SHOP, ARTIST SPACE AND OFFICES. HE'S ALSO PROPOSING TO INCLUDE ABT0 UNITS OF HOUNG TERRACED UP THE HILLSIDE ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE PROPERTY, WHICH LEADS UP TO HIS EXISTING PROPERTY, AND THE OLD -- THE MOVABLE FEEDS BUILDING ON WEST LIBERTY. REGARDING THE FLAWS IN THE PREENTITLEMENT PROPERTY THIS CAME AFTER A SERIES OF MEETINGS ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING ON CITY SITES, AROUND THE CITY, ONLY TWO PLANS HAD HOUSING ON THE WEST WASHINGTON SITE, WHICH APPEARS NONE OF WHICH WILL BE AFFORDABLE DUE TO THE FLOODPLAINS CONCERNS THAT WOULD PROHIBIT ANY FEDERAL OR STATE FUNDS BEING USED AT THIS SITE. AND ANOTHER FLAW HERE IS THAT NEARBY NEIGHBORS WERE NOT NOTIFIED ABOUT THIS PLAN UNTIL IT CAME BEFORE YOU IN APRIL, WHICH ON YOUR CONSENT AGENDA, IT WAS PROPOSED TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS WITHOUT NOTIFYING THE NEARBY NEIGHBORS. THANKFULLY THE MAJORITY OF YOU PERFPREVAILED AND THE NEIGHBORSE NOTIFIED ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON. I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU FOLKS ASKED YOUR STAFF TO PRESENT SOME OPTIONS TO THE NEIGHBOR BUT NO OPTIONS WERE PRESENTED. IS70 UNIT PLA W PRESENTED ASHE PROJECT, A WE WERE INVITED IN A WEBINAR, NOT AN OPEN MEETING WITH GIVE AND TAKE. IN A WEBINAR, WE WERE INVITED TO ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PROJECT WHICH WE DID, WHICH WERE NOT REALLY ANSWERED. WHAT IS PROPOSED NOW IS TO SPEND DO PREDEVELOPMENTLAN FOR EXPENSES THAT WOULD NORMALLY BE PAID B A DEVELOPER. THE PROJECT HAS NO AFFORDABLE HOUSING, THE BEST WE CAN TELL, AND THERE ARE OTHER NEGATIVE FACTORS INVOLVED TOO. YOU HAVE FLOODPLAIN AND FLOODWAY CONCERNS. YOU HAVE THE TREELINE AND THE GREENWAY USES BEING PRECLUDED BY THIS USE.
00:07:18.550: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECON.
00:07:19.818: >> IT' ANISRICISTRICT AND IT HAS A-- THERE'S 170 UNIT MASSIVE PROJECT IS ORBEARING ON THE NEARBY NEIGHBORHOOD. AND THERE'S NO ASSURANCE IF YOU DID SPEND THIS QUARTER MILLION DOLLARS YOU COULD FIND A DEVELOPER THAT WOULD BE WILLING TO COME IN DURING THE COVID TIMES TO PROCEED WITH THIS PROJECT ANYWAY AND I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY REAL COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND I THINK YOU FOLKS PROPOSS TONIGHT. OR SEEK OTHER AND I THA YOU FOR YOURIME AND THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING M TO SPEAK.
00:07:47.012: >> Clerk Beaudry: TIME.
00:07:47.546: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. MS. BEAUDRY, I GUESS I WILL RELY UPON YOU TO TELL ME WHEN DR. JACKSON IS AVAILABLE, IF THAT'S OKAY. THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS DAVID SILK WORTH.
00:08:09.734: >> Clerk Beaudry: GO AHEAD, MR. SILKWORTH.
00:08:11.937: >> GOOD EVENING. MY NAME IS DAVID SILKWORTH. I'M A FIFTH WARD RESIDENT AND CANDIDATE FOR CITY COUNCIL. I WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT ON DS-1, THE RESOLUTION TO CREATE THE AND REVIEW AND RECMENDATERIALS VELOENT ENTITLEMENTS FOR 415 WEST WASHINGTON. I BELIEVE IT WOULD BE A MISTAKE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS RESOLUTION AT THIS TIME. I WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE SEVERAL REASONS FOR MY POSITION. THE FIRST QUESTION OUR CITY SHOULD ASK ABOUT ANY PROPOSED RESOLUTION IS HOW DOES IT AFFECT THE RESIDENTS WHO WILL BE MOST IMPACTED BY IT AND HOW DO THEY FEEL ABOUT IT? WELL, I HE LISTE MANY OF THE -- LISTENED TO MANY OF THE EXCITING NEIGHBORS WHO ARE EXCITED TO HAVE THE SITE REACTIVATED AND BROUGHT BACK INTO THE FABRIC OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD BUT THEY ARE UNHAPPY WITH THE MASSING CURRENTLY BEING PROPOSED. THE OPINIONS OF THE SURROUNDING RESIDENTS SHOULD WEIGH MOST HEAVILY IN ANY DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS ON THIS SITE BECAUSE IT'S THEIR HOMES AND QUALITY OF LIFE THAT WILL BE MOST AFFECTED. SECOND, THIS SITE ISOT A VIABLE OPTION FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING DUE TO THE PROXIMITY TO THE RAILROAD TRACKS AN THE LOCATION IN A FLOOD PLAIN. THIRD, THE PROCESS FOR PREENTITLEMENT WILL COST MONEY AND STAFF RESOURCES THAT THE CITY CAN SIMPLY NO LONGER AFFORD DUE TO OUR CURRENT BUDGET SHORALLS, PENDING BGE CUTS AND UNCTAINTY IN THE REAL ESTATE MARKET. LASTLY, I RECENTLY ATTENDED A VIRTUAL NEIGHBORHOOD MEETING HOSTED BY JOE LAMBERT, AND HE HAS A PROPOSAL FOR REDEVELOPING THE SITE IN A MANNER THAT RESPECTS THE HISTORY OF THE BUILDING, ACTIVATES IT WITH SMALL SHOPS, ARTIST SPACES, PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC, AND SOME US AND ALSO MAINTAINS T CHIMNE F THE SWISS. HIS PLAN OFFERS OUTSTANDING PUBLIC BENEFITS AND PROVIDES SOLUTIONS TO MANY OF THE PROBLEMS OF THE SITE, AT A SCALE THAT IS MORE AGREEABLE TO THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY. IF HIS PROPOSAL IS ATTAINABLE, IT SOUNDS LIKE A WIN/WIN FOR EVERYONE. AS IT IS TODAY, 415 WEST WASHINGTON IS A NEIGHBOOOD PROBLEM. WOUL'T IT BE NIC IF WE COULD DEVELOP A NEIGHBORHOOD-FRIENDLY SOLUTION? SHOULDN'T WE AT LEAST GIVE THE MOST REASONABLE SOW HOUSE THAT PROVIDES MOST BEN -- SOLUTION THAT PROVIDES MOST BENEFIT TO THE LOCAL CIT CITIZENS SOME THANK YOU
00:10:37.782: >>ayor Taylor: THE NEXT SPEAKER ISOE LAMBERT.
00:10:42.754: >> Clerk Beaudry: MS. JACKSON IS AVAILABLE.
00:10:44.723: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MS. LAMBERT, WE WILL HOLD TIGHT ON YOU. DR. JACKSON, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
00:11:00.205: >> Clerk Beaudry: YOU JUST NEED TO UNMUTE YOURSELF.
00:11:02.040: >> SORRY FOR THE TROUBLES GETTING IN, EVERYBODY. SORRY TO INTERRUPT PUBLIC COMMENTS TO EVERYBODY ELSE. GOOD EVENING. BEFORE I GET STARTED, I HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ON THIS DAY IN 2017, FILANDA CASS STEEL WAS PULLED OVER FOR A BROKEN TAIL HEIGHT AND WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ROUTINE TRAFF STO HE WAS ULTIMATELY KILD IN FRONT OF HIS PARTNER AND INFANT CHILD, WHO LIVED TO BE ACQUITTED OF ALL CHARGES. I SET BOTH HERE AND AT OUR OWN MEETINGS WE MUST CONTINUE TO SAY THEIR NAMES AND ON THIS DAY I BELIEVE IT'S ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE SAY THE NAMES OF BOTH VICTIMS AND OFFICERS. RESOLUTION THAT THE INDEPENDENT COMMUNITY POLICE OVERSIGHT PASSED. MANY PEOPLE IN AND AROUND ANN ARBOR, RAN DAN OATS' COMMENTS IN THE JULY ANN ARBOR OBSERVER. I WOULD LIKE TO ECHO HIS SENTIMENT THAT THE MAJORITY OF POLICE OFFICERS ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE WILLING TO SACRIFICE THEMSELVES TO PROTECT OTHERS, POLICE OFFICERS WHO ENTEREDAL POLICE WORK AND STAYED IN POLICE WORK BECAUSE OF THEIR COMMITMENT TO HELP THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE. HOWEVER, AS WE ENGAGE IN OUR BROADER DISCOURSE ABOUT POLICE REFORM, IT'S CLEAR THAT ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND EVEN HERE IN ANN ARBOR, GOOD POLICE OFFICERS ARE NOT ENOUGH. NO REFORM IS GOING TO HAPN UNLESS POLITICIA SUCH AS THOSE OF YOU ON THIS COUNCIL ARE WILLING TO FIGHT FOR IT, BY TAKING ON POLICE UNIONS. I KNOW THAT BINDING ARBITRATION AND PUBLIC ACT 312 MIGHT SEEM TERRIFYING BUT WE URGE YOU TO NEGOTIATE FOR TERMS THAT WILL FACILITATE REAL TRANSPARENCY AND REAL REFORM. COLLECTIVE BARGAININ AGREEMENTS INCLUDING THENE ON THE TABLE TONIGHT ARE OFTEN ANTIQUATED AND THEY CONTAIN PROVISIONS REPRESENTATIVE OF CULTURAL ATTITUDES ON POLICING FROM DECADES LONG PAST. FURTHER, IN TALKING TO SEVERAL COUNCILMEMBERS, I WAS SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT YOU DON'T TYPICALLY REVIEW THE ENTIRE CONTRACT AS IT PROGRESSES. AND THAT YOU MIGHT NOT EVEN SEE IT UNTIL A FEW HOURS BEFORE IT COMES UP FOR A VOTE. THISS FRANKLY DISAPPOINTING, ESPECIALLY IN CONTRAST TO OUR COMMISSION, WHICH HAS TAKEN THE TIME TO GO THROUGH THE CONTRACT LINE-BY-LINE IN PREPARATION NOT JUST FOR THIS MEETING BUT IN ORDER TO BE BETTER ACCOUNTABLE TO THE COMMUNITY THAT WE SERVE. OUR RESOLUTION, WHICH HAS BEEN A2IPOC HAS ADDRESSED SOMEER AT SALIENT ISSUES. THIS IS BY NO MEANS AN EXAFTIVE LIST. FIRST THE COMMISSION REQUESTS THAT ANY COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT INCLUDE THAT ICPOC HAS ACCESS TO THE NAMES OF POLICE OFFICERS NAMED IN COMPLAINTS WHETHER EXONETEDR NOT. IT NECESSARY FOR US TO BE ABLE TO TRACK PATTERNS OF COMPLAINTS IN ORDER TO ASSURE THE PUBLIC THAT WE ARE, IN FACT, LIVING UP TO OUR MISSION OF ACCOUNTABILITY. WE WERE FORTUNATE TO BE ABLE TO CONSULT WITH THE CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE DURING THE CREATION OF OUR RESOLUTION, SO WE KNOW THAT THERE'S NO LEGAL IMPEDIMENT TO SECONDWE HAV ALSO LOOKED AT POLICE DISCIPLINE FILES, ALTHOUGH THE PERSONNEL FILES ARE RETAINED INDEFINITELY. THE PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINE OF POLICE ARE BASED ON THE LAST TWO YEARS ONLY. WE REQUEST THAT THIS BE EXTENDED TO SEVEN YEARS, BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT THAT PAST MISCONDUCT BE CONSIDERED IN DISCIPLINARY DECISIONS. ALTHOUGH OFFICERS SHOULD BE ABLE TO REDEEM THEELVES, IT IS CLR THAT TRE ARE SOME PATTERNS OF MISCONDUCT THAT WOULD BE BETTER EVALUATED AND DISCIPLINED OVER A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME. THIRD, WE REQUEST THE ELIMINATION OF BINDING ARBITRATION FOR TERMINATION. THE ELIMINATION OF BINDING ARBITRATION IN THIS MATTER HAS BEEN HAPPENING ACROSS THE COUNTRY, AS MUNICIPALITIES AGREE THAT POLICE CHIEFS NEED TO BE MISCONDUCT.ICE OFCERS FOR AS IT STANDS NOW, UNIONS NEGOTIATE FOR FAVORABLE RETIREMENT TERMS AND CHIEFS HAVE TO FIND CREATIVE EXPENSIVE PENSION PACKAGES TO GET RID OF PROBLEMATIC POLICE OFFICERS. FOURTH, ANOTHER PROBLEM WE HAVE CONSISTENTLY HAD IS THAT PROCESSES IN THIS CITY HAVE EXCLUDED US, EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE EXISTED FOR ALMOST TWO YEARS. FOR US TO HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED THROUGHOUT THIS NEGOTIATION PROCESS IS A SERIOUS OVERSIGHT. I CAN'T HELP BUT BE REMINDS OF WHITES ONLY PRIMARIES THAT TOOK MACE DURING RECONSTRUCTION WHERE IF FRIEIF AFRICAN AMERICANS WERE ALLOWED TO VOTE AT ALL, THEY WERE ALLOWED TO DAT THE END OF THEROCESS, AFTER THE PRIMARY CANDIDATES WERE SELECTED. THAT WAS THE ISSUE WITH THE POLICE CHIEF AND THIS BARGAINING AGREEMENT. THAT MUST BE REMEDIED. GOING FORWARD, WE WANT TO BE NOTIFIED OF A 30-DAY INTENT TO BARGAIN ANY POLICE CONTRACT AND WE WANT THE CHIEF NEGOTIATOR, WHETHER IT'S THE HR OR THE CITY MANAGER'S OFFICE TO GIVE US TIMELY AND REGULAR UPDATES TO ANY BARGAING. WE ALSOANT OUR CONCERNS TO BE INCLED AND TAKEN INTO SERIOUS CONSIDERATION DURING NEGOTIATIONS. WE UNDERSTAND THAT CITY COUNCIL HAS MANY CONCERNS, BUT OUR ONLY FOCUS AND THE REASON FOR OUR EXISTENCE IS POLICE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. THE ENTIRETY OF OUR COMMISSION IS BEING TRAINED AS CERTIFIED PRACTITIONERS OF OVERSIGHT AND EXPERTISE  BR DURING THE NEGOTIATION PROCESS. WE REPRESENT THE ANN ARBOR COMMUNITY AND THEY NEE TO HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT THERE'S A TRAINED BODY OF INDIVIDUALS EXAMININGHE CONTRACT. PRAGMATICALLY SPEAKING IF YOU GUYS ARE CONCERNED THAT DOING THE RIGHT THING WILL NEGATIVELY AFFECT YOUR REELECTION PROSPECTS WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO ASSUME THAT REONSIBILI. FINALLY, I HEO SAY THAT FOR US TO HAVE BEEN CONSULTED REGARDING THIS CONTRACT FOR THE FIRST TIME ON MONDAY, JUNE JUNE 1st, ON THE DAY THAT THE CONTRACT WAS FIRST UP FOR A VOTE BY COUNCIL, IS INCREDIBLY INDICATIVE OF HOW UNIMPORTANT IT IS TO THIS BODY THAT ANYBODY THOROUGHLY EXAMINES THE CBA AND ASKS THE HARD QUESTIONS. PEOPLE WHO LIVE AND WORK IN ANN ARBOR ARE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THE FACT THAHIS BODYEADILY VOTES ON SH IMPORTANT CONTRACTS WITHOUT READING THEM! AND THIS COMMUNITY CERTAINLY DESERVES TO KNOW THAT SOMEONE EXAMINES THESE ISSUES WITH THEIR INTEREST IN MIND. IT'S OUR SINCERE HOPE THAT CITY COUNCIL DOES NOT PASS THE CBA. IT WOULD DISREGARD THE ENORMOUSOUT POURI OF POLICE REFORM AND THE ENTIRE PROCESS, THE ENTIRE PURPOSE OF OUR COMMISSION'S EXISTENCE. THANK YOU.
00:17:40.304: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. MR. LAMBERT.
00:17:53.851: >> CAN YOU HEAR ME?
00:17:54.986: >> Mayor Taylor: WE CAN. THANK YOU.
00:17:55.920: >> THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. I WILL BE QUICK. SO IN RELATION TO 415 WEST WASHINGTON, WE WOULD ASK FOR A PAUSE IN THAT, OR TABLING OF THE ISSUE. I THINK WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO FIND IS THAT STAFF HAS GONE OFF AND VERY DILIGENTLY PURSUED WHAT COUNCIL ASKED THEM TO DO, WHICH IS AEVOPMENT THAT'SIAE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND WITHIN THAT, IS THAT THEY HAVE PROVEN THE DEVELOPMENT THIS WITH AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS NOT VIABLE AND THE MOTION IS TO PROCEED SPENDING MONEY TO CONTINUE MOVING FORWARD TOWARDS A PLAN THAT STAFF HAS NOT PROVEN VIABLE. IN COMPARISON, W HE A PROPOSAL, PROJECT WCH WOULD LIKE T PUT IN FRONT O YOU. WE HAVEN'T HAD TIME IN THE LAST 40 DAYS TO GET IF FRONT OF THE TEAM WITH COVID BUT IT FOCUSES ON COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT IN THE SPACE, RENOVATION OF THE BUILDINGS THAT ARE THERE, THE PRESERVATION AND THE CHIMNEY SWIFTS AND A TON OF GREEN SPACE AND SHOPS FOR LOCAL VENDORS AND ARTISTS, PRESERVATN OF T -- I SAID THE CHIMNEY SWIFTS, SORRY, AND A LITTLE BIT OF HOUSING. A SMALL AMOUNT OF WHICH IS AFFORDABLE, REALLY LIKE 10%. NOT MUCH. BUT SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE A LEGACY FOR ANN ARBOR, SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE REALLY VERY FOCAL TO ANN ARBOR AND SOMETHING UNIQUE TO ANN ARBOR AS OPPOSED TO ANOTHER LARGE BUILDING THAT WOULD BE PERFECTLY AT HOME IN PLYMOUTH, CANTON, OR GRA RAPIDS. SOMETHING THAT LOOKS FORWARD TO THE INNOVATIVE CREATIVE FUTURE AND IF WE COULD HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME, WE ARE ASKING FOR THAT OPTION TO PUT THIS IN FRONT OF YOU, SHOW IT TO YOU AND BUILD YOUR CONFIDENCE AND WE'RE READY TO GO QUICKLY AND 36 MONTHS WE ARE LOOKING TO HAVE THE PREDOMINANCE OF THE SITE REACTIVATED AND KIDS AND ADULTS IN THIS HAVING FUN. WE ASK TO P LITTLE BIT OF A BREA IN THIS. I THINK THERE'S PROBABLY A COUPLEF OTHERHINGS WHY IT' MIGHT BE WELL-ADVISED MOVING FORWARD WITH THE ENTITLEMENT WORK BEFORE WE CAN SHOW YOU SOMETHING BETTER. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TO YOU GUYS AND WOULD WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK MORE AND IN DETAILS AND DIG INTO IT. I THINK IF WE GET A CHANCE TO DO THAT, YOUIL BE EVERY BIT EXCITED ABOUT WHAT'S POSSIBLE HERE AND NOT TRYINGO SLAM ANOTHER BIG PROJECT OUT OF THAT SITE. THANKS MUCH. YOU KNOW WHERE TO FIND ME, I HOPE. SO PLEASE REACH OUT. THANKS, BYE.
00:20:15.493: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS MOZHGAN SAVABIEASFAHANI.
00:20:23.801: >> HELLO. CAN YOU HEAR ME?
00:20:25.236: >> Mayor Tlo YES, WE CAN.

I ALSO VOTE TO TE T $30 LLION THAT ANN ARBOR SPENDS EACH YEAR ON POLICING AND DIVERTING IT TO ANN ARBOR'S COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT POSSIBLE. MY OPPONENTS WILL DO NO SUCH THING.

SHE'S THE ONLY CANDIDATE IN WARD 4, I BELIEVE FOR SURE THE ONLY CANDIDATE IN WARD 4 WHO IS ASKING FOR AN IMMEDIATE CLEANUP OF THE GELMAN OF THE DIOXANE PLUME. NO ONE ELSE WILL DO IT. AND THE EPA SAID, UUH, NO, IT MAY TAK THEM 30 YEARS TO THINK ABOUT TOKING IT. SHE'S YOUR CANDIDATE IF YOU WANT -- IF YOU VALUE THE ENVIRONMENT. AND IF YOU CARE ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS, SHE'S YOUR CANDIDATE. NO OTHER CANDIDATE IN WARD 4 HAS STOOD UP FOR THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE. EATON HAS PUSHED HARD AGAINST THE RESOLUTION THAT WOU PROTECT PALESTINIANS, THE RESOLUTION AGAINST POLITICAL MID AND AS FAR AS IER GOES, SHE HAD A ENDORSERS WHO WERE HONCHOS WHO WERE FRIENDS IN THEDF. THEYERE FENDS IN THE ISRAELI DEFENSE FORCES MICHIGAN CHAPTER AND ONE OF THOSE FRIENDS HAS BEEN ATTACKING DR. SAVABIEASFAHANI VICIOUSLY AND DR.  -- AND MS. EYER HAS NOT STOPPED HIM. AND ALSO MS.

00:26:55.292: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS PETER HOUK.
00:27:09.606: >> Clerk Beaudry: GO AHEAD.
00:27:11.375: >> HELLO. CAN YOU HEAR ME?
00:27:12.810: >> Mayor Taylor: YES, WE CAN.
00:27:14.745: >> HELLO, COUNCILMEMBERS. ANKS FOR THE CHANCE TO COMMENT. I'M PETER HOUK. A RESIDENT ON YEOMAN COURT. I WOULD LEOELL YOU ABOUT APAN INCIDENT THAT HAPPENED TO Y FAMILY IN 2009. WE WERE WAITING AT THE TRAFFIC CORNER AND TRAFFIC WAS NONSTOP AT 9:00 IN THE MORNING. THIS ARE WAS NO GAP WE COULD RUN THROUGH AND GET OURSELVES AND OUR BIKES AND OUR CHILD ACROSS THE STREET. I EDGED CLOSER TO THE STREET HOPING THAT PEOPLE WOU UNDERSND WE WERE TRYG TO CRSND STOP AND LET US THROUGH. NO ONE DID. BUT A WOMAN DID SPEED BY AND HONK AT US. WE WAITED ■ITOUT AND EVENTUALLY WE DARTED ACROSS BUT WE WERE SCARED AND STRESSED OUT FROM TRYING TO CROSS A STREET IN OUR OWN TOWN. NOW, IT'S HAPPENED SINCE THAT DAY IN 2009. COUNCIL PASSED A LOCAL CROSSWALK ORDINANCE WITH INPUT FROM LEGAL STF, AND CMUNITY MEMBERS. A PEDESTRIAN SAFETY TASK FORCE WAS FORMED AND RECOMMENDED THAT WE KE KEEP THE ORDINANCE AND THY RECOMMENDED IT AGAIN AND AGAIN. AN INDEPENDENT ENGINEERING ANALYSIS DETERMINED THAT THE ORDINANCE WAS REASONABLE IN LINE WITH EXPECTATION FOR DRIVER BEHAVIOR AND DRIVER EDUCATION IN MICHIGAN. THE RESULTS ARE IN THE STUES KE THE 2017 STUDYF DRIVER BEHAVIOR THAT ANN ARBOR DID AND I SEE THE RESULTS EVERY TIME I USE A CROSSWALK. PEOPLE WAIT FOR ME AND MY FAMILY WHEN WE ARE STANDING ON THE CURB. THE CULTURE HAS CHANGED. IS COMPLIANCE 100%, NO, BUT IT IS SO MUCH BETTER NOW. USING A CROSSWALK WITH MY FAMILY IS NO LONGERN ANXIETY-PROVEHICLING EVENT. BUT TODAY, WITH -- PVEHICLING EVENT, BUT TODAY, WE RISK TUTURNING THE CLOCK BACK TO 200. DRIVERS WON'T HAVE A LEGAL REQUIREMENT TO YIELD TO ME UNTIL I PUT MY BODY INTO THE ROADWAY. IS THIS REALLY WHAT WE WANT? PEOPLE RUNNING ACROSS TRAFFIC WHEN THERE'S A GAP. THAT'S NOT WHAT I WANT, NOT FOR ME OR KIDS OR PEOPLE IN WHEELCHAIRS. PLENTY OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS DON'T WANT IT EITHER. IN THE LAST 36 HOURS, 285 PEOPLE HAVE SIGNED MY PETITION ASKING YOU NOT TO ENDORSE THIS LAW THAT WILL NULLIFY OUR LOCAL ORDINANCE. COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD HAS WORKED WITH A STATE REPRESENTATIVE FROM OUTSIDE OF ANN ARBOR TO INTRODUCE HOUSE LL 18OHE REPUBLICAN-CONTROLLED LEGISLATURE. COUNCILMEMBERS IS THIS HOW YOU ADVOCATE FOR YOUR CONSTITUENTS. ASK IN REPUBLICANS TO DECIDE WHAT RIGHTS THE PEDESTRIANS OF ANN ARBOR DO AND DON'T GET?
00:29:45.362: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
00:29:46.430: >> THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU DO IF YOU VOTE FOR DC-11. I UNDERSTAND THE ASSERTION THAT THE BIL M IMPROVE LEGISLATIVE COMMITTE EA WAITND EORSE IT ONCE THE LANGUAGE IS CORRECT. WHY THE RUSH TO ENDORSE A BILL THAT'S NOT CONSISTENT WITH WHAT ANN ARBOR RESIDENTS WANT? BY ALL MEANS, SUPPORT A STATEWIDE CROSSWALK LAW, BUT PLEASE DO NOT ENDORSE ONE THAT DOESN'T ALREADY INCLUDE THE PROTECTIONS THAT YOUR ANN ARBOR CONSTITUENTS HAVE TODAY. ONE LAST THING, IF YOU HAVEN'T SIGNED, YOU C FINY PETITION ON CHANGE.ORG. I WILL SHARE THE RESULTS WITH COUNCILMEMBERS BEFORE DISCUSSION ON DC-11 BEGINS.
00:30:23.934: >> Clerk Beaudry: TIME.
00:30:24.468: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS SHANNON HAHAUTAMAKI.
00:30:40.184: >>S. HAUTAMAKI GO AHEAD.
00:30:41.151: >> THANK YOU, MEMBERS OF COUNCIL FOR HOLDING THIS MEETING OVER ZOOM AND TAKING CALLS FROM THE PUBLIC. I WANT TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO EXPRESS MY THANKS PUBLICLY FOR OUR PARKS DEPARTMENT. MY FAMILY HAS BEEN WORKING OUR WAY THROUGH THE VISIT EVERY PARK CHALLENGE AND HAVING A LOT OF FUN EXPLORING DIFFERENT PARTS OF OUR CITY, OUTSIDE AND SAFELY. WE EVEN G T SWIM AT FULLER RK POOL ON FRIDAY, WHICH ALL WENT VERY SMOOTY TO ALLOW AT LEAST A SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE COOL OFF WITH A GREATLY -- MY SONS HAD A GOOD TIME AND IT WAS NICE TO SEE THEM BE KIDS IN A NORMAL WAY. BECAUSE OF POSTPONEMENTS BY THIS COUNCIL,ASIER LIFE WHILE ACTICING SOCIAL DISTANCING HAS BEEN DELAYED AND STALLED. I URGE YOU ALL TO PASS DC-3 AND 4, AND PROVIDING MORE STREET SPACE FOR ORDINARY PEOPLE, NOT JUST RESTAURANTS AND RETAIL SHOPS. I WAS EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED IN COUNCIL'S ACTION THREE WEEKS AGO TO POSTPONE DISCUSSION OF THOSE RESOLUTIONS THAT REMED SOME TRAVEL LANESND THE NUMBER OF STREETS THAT WE CAN MAKE SPACE FOR PEDESTRIAN BIKE LANES AND PEDESTRIAN PASSING LANES. THE PREJUDICE GIV -- THE PRESENTATION THAT WAS GIVEN TO YOU GAVE PICTURES OF THE STREETS AND INSTEAD OF LISTENING TO THAT PROPOSAL AND HEEDING THE RECOMMENDATIONS BEFORE VOTING FOR THE POSTPONEMENT, CERIN MEMBERSOMPLNED ABOUT SINTIAL SEETS UNDERGOING CLOSURES FOR NONLOCAL TRAFFIC. SOMETHING THAT IS NOT EVEN PART OF THOSE RESOLUTIONS. IN FACT, COUNCIL GAVE ITS APPROVAL FOR STAFF TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT THOSE RESIDENTIAL STREET CLOSURES CALLED NEIGHBORHOOD SLOW STREETS ON MAY 4th. SPEAKING OF THAT, I REALLY APPRECIATE MR. CRAWFORD'S UPDATE ON THAT, BUT IT HAS BEEN MULTIPLE WEE AFTER MY STREET ON BROOKLYN AVENUEAS PROPOSED TO BE CLOSED TO NONLOCAL TRAFFIC AND WE'RE STILL WAITING ON THE BARRICADES IN SIGNAGE. WHEN I INQUIRED ABOUT THIS, THEY DIRECTED ONCE TO STOP THE BARRICADES FROM GOING UP, CONCERNS FROM COUIL AND CONCERNS THAT I HAVE YET TO HEAR IT'S MADDENING THAT TSE SOFT CLOSURES ARE HAPPENING, BUT WE CAN'T GET IT TOGETHER IN ANN ARBOR. IT'S BEEN FOUR MONTHS SINCE THIS PANDEMIC HIT. WHILE IT'S REALLY NICE TO SEE PEOPLE MAKE USE OF THE SHUTDOWN STREETS IN THE DOWNTOWN AREA ON WEEKENDS TO ENJOY LOCAL RESTAURANTS OUTSIDE. IT'S VERY TELLING HOW QUICKLY THESE RO CLOSURESAPPENED, BECAE THERE WAS MONEY TO BE MADE. FOR PEOPLE TO GET TO THEIR JOBS SAFELY OR EXERCISE OR GET AROUND WITHOUT A CAR MORE EASILY, THAT HAD TO BE DELAYED BY THREE WEEKS. WE ARE CURRENTLY ALMOST FOUR MONTHS INTO THIS PANDEMIC WHERE MANY PEOPLE HAD THEIR LIVES COMPLETELY --
00:33:24.448: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
00:33:26.416: >>  -- INSTEAD OF DOING WHAT YOU CAN TO ALLOW PPLEEORE HEALTHY, IT HAS BEEN DELAYED. LET YOUR CITY ENGINEERS GET TO WORK ON THE PILOT PROGRAMS BEFORE THE CHANGES IN WEATHER MAKE IT TOO LATE FOR THESE CHANGES TO BE OF MUCH USE. THANK YOU.

I AM CALLING IN TOD, BECAUSE I'M DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE FACT THAT IPPCPOC EXISTS AND HASN'T BEEN GIVEN ANY ABILITIES TO DO THE JOB THAT IT'S DESIGNED TO DO. DR. JACKSON WAS JUST SPEAKING EARLIER ABOUT HOW SHE SOUNDS ILLIAN AT HER JOB AND Y'ALL WON'T LET HER DO IT. Y'ALL HAVE NOT INTEGRATED -- IT SEEMS LIKE WHAT HAPPENED TWO YEARS AGO, THAT ICPO CLOC WAS CREATED. GREAT, WE DID THE JOB. WE DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING FURTHER. WE DON'T HAVE TO INTEGRATE THIS INTO EVERY ASPECT OF THE -- ACCOUNT FOR EVERY ASPECT OF THE POLICE, GIVE THEM ACTUAL AUTHORITY TO DO THE JOB, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW -- I MEAN EITHER YOU CREATED THIS AND WILL GIVE THEM THE AUTHORITY TO DO TRUE OVERSIGHT OR IT WAS JUST TO LOOK GOOD. [ CHUCKLES ] AND SO, YOU KW, YEAH. LIKE, GIVE HER THE AUTHORITY TO DO HER JOB. SHE KNOW MS. W -- SHE KNOWS WHAT SHE'S DOING. I TRUST HER MORE THAN YOU. Y'ALL HAVE NOT BEEN DOING YOUR JOB. THAT'S BEEN CLEAR. RIGHT? WE HAVE CONTRACTS THAT FRANKLY PROVIDE WAY TOO MUC PO POCE UNIONS. WE AS PEOPLE WHO JUST LIVE IN TOWN HAVE NO POWER IN THIS SITUATION. AND WHEN WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO THIS COMMISSION, YOU HAVE GIVEN IT NO CHIEFS. WHY? I GUESS I'M CALLING IN SUPPORT OF ICPOC. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE ARE SO SLOW TO PROVIDE THEM THE RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED AND ALSO THE AUTHORITY TO MAKE CALLS IN DECISIONS. CLEARLY EVERYONE IS VERY SLOW TO INVOLVE THEM IN MOST OF THIS PROCESS BUT ALSO THEY HAVEN'T BEEN GIVEN OFFICIAL AHORITY TO DO A LOT OF THESE THINGS.
00:36:28.865: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
00:36:30.934: >> (INAUDIBLE). I WOULD LIKE THEM TO BE MORE THAN JUST ORNAMENTAL. I WOULD LIKE THEM TO REPRESENT ME. [ CHUCKLES ] AND I WOULD LIKE THEM TO HAVE ACTUAL OVERSIGHT CAPACITY AND RESPONSIBILITY AND AUTHORITY AND THAT MEANS BEING ABLE TO SAY WHEN SOMEONE GETS SANKIONED RING PEOE. -- SANCTIONE AND FIRING PEOPLE. I SUPPORT DR. JACKSON'S STATEMENTS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. TAME THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS TOM STULBERG.
00:37:01.031: >> GOOD EVENING. THIS IS TOM STULBERG. I LIVE AT 1202 TRAVER STREET AND ARBOR IGHBORS FORESPONSIBLE DEVELOPMENT. AS YOU ALL KNOW WE SERVE THE CITY OVER THE IMPROPER REZONING OF THE LOWER TOWN SITE TO C1A/R WITH ZBA VARIANCES AND WITH ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS. I WILL NOT TALK ABOUT THE DETAILS OF THE LAWSUIT TONIGHT. YOU ARE ALL VERY AWARE OF THEM. ANYBODY IN THE PUBLIC THAT IS NOT, CAN GO WWW.LOWERTOWNLIFE.ORG, WHERE WE HAVE DETAILS. WE HAVE THE ACTUAL LAWSUIT POSTED. WE HAVE AN FAQ PAGE. SO WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SUIT? WE SETTLED WITH THE CITY. WE DISSSED IT WITHOUT PREJUDICE, WHICH ALLOWS US TO BRING IT BACK IF THE CITY DOESN'T, YOU KNOW, FULFILL ITS SETTMENT.E DEAL I O SETTLI ITY THAT MANNER ALLOWED THE CITY TO NOT SPEND THE PERSONNEL HOURS TO ANSWER IN DETAIL TO THE COURT A DEFENSE OF THE POINTS IN THE LAWSUIT AND IN EXCHANGE, THERE'S A LIST OF ITEMS THAT THE CITY AGREES TO DO. SO MORATORIUM TONIGHT IS BRINGING THE RESOLUTION TO HAVE THIS PORE TOREIUMONIG. IT PART --ORATORIUM TONIGHT. IT'S PART OF THIS AGREEMENT. I THANK YOU FOR MOVING FORWARD WITH THAT. LAST WEEK, I SENT YOU A 30-PAGE DOCUMENT TO REVIEW FROM WELL-KNOWN EXPERT IN THIS FIELD, AND IT INCLUDES COMMENTS ON THE HISTORY AND THE USE OF C1A AND INCLUDED THE NOVEMBER 13, 1987 REPORT FM THE PLANNING DIRECTOR TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION, WHICH WAS AN ANALYSIS OF C1A/4 AND SOME OF THE C2s AT THE TIME IN DOWNTOWN. I WANTED TO GIVE YOU PLENTY OF TIME TO DIGEST THAT DOCUMENT BECAUSE IT'S CLEAR AS YOU READ THAT, THAT THE CITY HAS BEEN CONTEMPLATING CHANGES IN THE ELIMINATION OF SOME OF THESE CATEGORIES IN QUITE SOMETIME. INDEED C1A AND C2A/R WERE REPLACED BY D1 AND D2, WHEN WE REVIEWED THIS NOT THAT RECENT, BUT NOT THAT LONG AGO EITHER. THINGS AT THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT ARE LOOKING -- WE SUGGEST LOOKING AT C1A/R AND FOR EXAMPLE TRANSIT-ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT, T1 THAT HAS THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT IS WORKING ON. RECOGNIZE THE ADVANTAGE OF TRUE MIXED USE ZONING. THE LAPPING DEPARTMENT IS GOING THROUGH A REVIEW OF THE PLANNED PROJECT ORDINANCE AND RECENTLY OUR ADOPTION OF THE UDC. SO THERE'S SOME REAL UNANSWERED QUESTIONS ABOUT OUR MIXED USE ZONING.
00:39:40.223: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
00:39:40.857: >> IT GS REAL CFUNG WHEN YOU GET IO DIFFERENT FACTS AND DIFFERENT MIXED USE CATEGORIES AND HOW MUCH MIXED USE IS MIXED USE. IS IT 100% OR 0%? THESE ARE A LOT OF QUESTIONS AND THE LOCATION WHICH CANNOT BE IN THE CAMPUS PURPOSE DISTRICT. AND YOU HAVE DISAGREEMENT. IT'S TIME FOR A STUDY AND A MORATORIUM SO WE CAN COME TO AN AGEMT, WHATSPPROPRIATE FOR THE CAMPUS BUSINESS DISTRICT ZONING. THANK YOU.
00:40:10.420: >> Mayor Taylor: OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS RALPH MCKEE.
00:40:19.262: >> Clerk Beaudry: MR. McKEY?
00:40:19.863: >> HI. THIS IS RALPH McKEE. 310 RED OF COURSE. PLEASE FOLLOW THE LEAD OF ICPOC AS DESCRIBED BY DR. LISA JACKSON. SECOND ON DC-9, PLEASE APPROVE THE PORE TOREIUM, THE CAMPUS BUSINESS DISTRICT ZONING WAS USED IMPROPERLY FOR PROJECTS THAT ENTHUSIASM HAVE BEEN PUDs AND PUT DOLLARS INTO THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUND. ON D IS-1, 415 WEST WASHINGTON. THIS IS PARADIGM OF GOOD INTENTIONS AND BAD PROCESS EQUALS ENOUGH. POLICYMAKERS ARE SUPPOSE TO BE THE CITIZENS AND THE ELECTIVE REPRESENTATIVES NOT THE STAFF. THE POLICY DIRECTOR HERE TO STAFF WAS TO EVALUATE SITES FOR VIABILITY OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IELIEVE TT STA QUICKLY ANDT. EALY DETERMINE THAT BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING WAS NOT FEASIBLE ON THIS SITE. THE EARLY PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT SHOWED THAT SELLING THE PROPERTY TO GENERATE PROCEEDS RANKED VERY LOW BUT THE STAFF KEPT WORKING ON DEVELOPMENT. AS FAR AS I CAN TELL UNDER THE RUBRIC OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THAT'S LAUDABLE BUT ONLY UP TO A POINT. THE PROPOSA GOT SCIFIC PRETTY FAST AND THE NEIGHBORS HADN'T EVEN BEEN NOTIFIED. THE PUBLIC INPUT GATHERED AT THE FEBRUARY MEETING WAS INACCURATELY DESCRIBED BY STAFF AND CONSULTANT. IT DOESN'T REALLY SUPPORT THE DIRECTION STAFF WAS GOING IN. LINDA BUREAU'S EMAIL TO YOU LAYS THAT OUT  PAINSTAKING DETAIL. YOU ENGAGED THE NEIGHBORS ON WHAT THE WOULD LIKE ON THE SITE. INSTEAD THEY GOT A WEBINAR PRESENTING AND DEFENDING A I ATTENDED IT. STAFF SAID THAT THERE WOULD LIKELY NOBODY AFFORDABLE UNITS. SO THE ONLY CONNECTION TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING WAS POSSIBLE SALE PROCEEDS. AS TO THAT, STAFF SAID ONLY IF THE BILLING HAD TO BE AT -- BUILDING HAD TO BE AT LEAST AS BIG TENERATE MONEY FOR THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUN. THAT'S NOT ENOUGH INFO. IN THE DRIVER OF THIS WHOLE PROCESS IS AFFORDABLE HOUSING DOLLARS IN THE FUND, STAFF NEEDS TO PROVIDE YOU, AS POLICYMAKERS WITH AN ESTIMATE OF THE REMEDIATION AND OTHER COSTS COMING OFF THE TOP, WHETHER HDC APPROVAL IS LIKE AND THE IMPACT OF THE EXPANONF T FODWAY AND A ROUGH IDEA TO THE NET PROCEEDS. TO GO FORWARD SPENDING $250,000 WITHOUT PREENTITLEMENT MAKES NO SENSE. WE HEARD A LOT FROM MAYOR TAYLOR IN RECENT CAMPAIGN LITERATURE WITH REGARD TO LACK OF RESPECT FOR STAFF AND THE PUBLIC. THREE POINTS, THE PUBLIC --
00:42:55.919: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
00:42:57.220: >> THE PUBLICS ENTITLESO RESPECT. TWO RESPECT IS A TWO-WAY STREET. AND IT THREE YOU HAVE TO EARN THAT RESPECT. THANK YOU FOR LISTENING. I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME.
00:43:11.100: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. ARE THERE COMMUNICATIONS TODAY COCIL MEMBER HAYNER, I SEE YOUR HAND U IS THAT FROM A WHILE AGO?
00:43:23.546: >> Councilmember Hayner: THAT'S NEW, BUT, YOU KNOW, YOUR PICK. THANK YOU. JUST A COUPLE OF THINGS REAL QUICK. I WANT TO LET SOME FOLKS KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON. YOU KNOW, WE ASKED TO DO -- LOOK AT A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS, AND A LOT OF LEGISLATION, RESOLUTIONS AND SO ON, AND SOMETIMES THEY TAKE A LONG TIME BUT WIND THEIR WAY UP TO BE IN FRONT OF US HER ANDOME OF THO HAVE HAD SOME FRUSTRATING ENDS TO THEM RECENTLY. WE HAD PLANNED -- I HAD PLANNED TO BRING FORWARD APRIL ORDINANCE REQUIRING ELECTRIFICATION OF ALL NEW CONSTRUCTION HERE IN THE CITY AND THAT'S BEEN EXAMINED BY OUR LEGAL STAFF AND THEY EXPRESSED SOME CONCERNS THAT IT MIGHT BE CHALLENGED IN COURT BECAUSE STATE DOESN'T ALLOW IT GH NOW. WELL, HAVE DONE TT FOR OTHER THINGS AND I BELIEVE IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND I'M GOING TO TRY TO GO AHEAD AND BRING THAT FORWARD AND WE'LL TRY TO GET IT WRITTEN IN A WAY THAT DELAYS THAT KIND OF POTENTIAL CHALLENGE TO DEVELOPERS WHICH IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF OUR A2ZERO PLAN THAT WE APPROVED RECENTLY. SAME THING WHEN I SPOKE ON THE ROONEY RULE FOR HIRING AND I WANT TO THANK OUR ADMINISTRATOR AND ASSISTANT ADMINISTRATOR FOR WORKING THAT IN AND WE WILL HAVE BEFORE US NEXT WEEK STAFF OR COUNCIL -- STAFF'S RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE ROONEY RULE WHICH IS THE MANDATE THAT WE INTERVIEW AND CANDIDATES OF COLOR AND WOMEN FOR ANY EXECUTIVE POSITIONS HERE. IT'S GOING TO BE INTEGRATED INTO OUR HR DOCUMENTS AND SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT. I'VE HAD A LF PEOPLEACH T TO ME AND ASK IF I COULD MAKE A LOCAL MASK LAW TO REQUIRE PEOPLE TO WEAR MASKS AND MAKE IT EASIER FOR BUSINESSES TO MANDATE THAT PEOPLE WEAR MASKS IN THEIR BUSINESSES AND I HAVEN'T SENT THAT OFF TO LEGAL YET. I NO HE KNOW THAT'S DIFFICULT BE THE STATE IS VACILLATING ON THAT. I THINK IT WOULD EVEN BEE BEFICIAL FOR US. WE HAV SEEN ALL OF THOSE U OF M PARTIES AND THIS AND THAT WILL BE TROUBLE. SOME OTHER TROUBLE WE ARE HAVING IN OUR COMMUNITY IS THIS ISSUE OF RENT CONTROL AND EVICTIONS. AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE NATIONAL ESTIMATES FOR EVICTIONS, IT'S A REAL MESS COMING FORWARD, AND, AGAIN, THIS IS A SITUATION WHERE THE CITY DOESN'T REALLY HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO STEP INTO THESE PRATE CONTRAS BETEN TENANTS AND LANDLDS AND BUILDING OWNERS AND I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT THERE'S NOT MUCH WE CAN DO, BUT I WANTED TO THANK THE FOLKS WHO SENT ME POTENTIAL RESOLUTION THAT WAS SIMILAR TO ONE THAT WAS ACTED ON IN ITHACA, NEW YORK, AND SO I WILL BE SENDING THAT OVER TO LEGAL TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. IS THIS ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO, YOU KNOW, CONTINUE TO HELPIT COTY AND STATEORESTALL THESE EVICTIONS, IT'S A CRISIS THAT'S LOOMING BEFORE US. IT'S A REAL PROBLEM AND I WANT TO BE ABLE TO HELP THESE PEOPLE. WE WANT TO KEEP PEOPLE OUR COMMUNITY. I WOULD RATHER HAVE SOMEBODY IN A BUILDING, SOMEBODY IN A HOME, THAN OUT ON THE STREET. IT'S JUST COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATE TO BE KICKING PEOPLE OUT ON THE STREET IN THIS DAY AND AGE. I WANT TO L FOLKS KNO THAT WE AR WORKING ON TSE THINGS AND WE'RE GETTING TO THEM AS FAST AS WE CAN, AND HOPEFULLY WE'LLAVE SOME GOOD NS FOR YOU AT THE MayOUNCTING. SMITH. TAYLOR ITT Rer SmithI WT
