00:01:29.866: >> YES, MAYOR, I WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT STAFF HAS BEEN VERY BUSY. IF YOU LOOK ON THE AGENDA, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF COMMUNICATIONS ABOUT THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN GOING ON. ONE I WOULD HIGHLIGHT FOR YOUR ATTENTION IS A MEMO ON THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS FOR A DRAFT RESOLUTION FOR APPROVING MARIJUANA LICENSES IN THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO TAKE JUST A MINUTE TO RECOGNIZE AND CONGRATULATE THE OFFICE OF SUSTAINABILITY AND INNOVATION. LAST WEEK, THEY WERE ABLE TO HELP WITH RESIDENTS, U OF M STUDENTS, SOME PEOPLE FROM THE ENERGY COMMISSION AND STAFF, SOLAR PANELS ON THE ROOF OF FIRE STATION 6. THE RESULT WILL BE OFFSETTING THE ENERGY NEEDS OF THAT STATION AND IS REFLECTIVE OF A LOT OF WORK. ADDITIONALLY, THE PUBLIC WORKS HAVE THEIR FIRST OPEN HOUSE THIS PAST WEEKEND. WE HAD OVER 280 RESIDENTS ATTEND. IT WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE. IT WAS A FUN EVENT. PEOPLE GOT TO HANG ON THE BLADE OF SNOWPLOWS AND WORK ON THE ARM ON A SOLID WASTE TRUCK. TRY THEIR SKILLS ON CLIMBING ON SOME OF THE EQUIPMENT AND IT WAS A LOT OF FUN BY THE PEOPLE WHO WERE THERE. LASTLY, I WILL POINT OUT THAT THE CITIZENS ACADEMY STARTED A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO HAS OPENED UP FOR APPLICATIONS. IF YOU KNOW OF SOMEONE WOULD IS INTERESTED IN THAT, THAT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO LEARN ABOUT THE CITY OPERATIONS. THEY CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION ABOUT IT ON THE CITY'S WEBSITE OR CONTACT THE CLERK'S OFFICE AND THANKS TO OFFICER KEEN FOR JOINING US TONIGHT.
00:03:13.202: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. WE NOW HAVE A BRIEF ENTORONTO DUCKION, A -- INTRODUCTION, PROCLAMATION, RECOGNIZING CO-OP MONTH OF OCTOBER IN ANN ARBOR. IF THERE ARE ANY REPRESENTATIVES PLEASE JOIN ME AT THE PODIUM. SO, YOU KNOW, THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF WAYS TO ORGANIZE BUSINESS AND ALL SORTS OF WAY TO ACHIEVE SOCIAL GOOD AND BAN TOGETHER TO ACCOMMODATE BOTH TO ACHIEVE BOTH. AND ONE OUTSTANDING WAY OF AFFECTING AND OPERATING IN COMMERCE AND ACHIEVING SOCIAL GOOD IS COOPERATIVES. AND WE ARE SO FORTUNATE IN ANN ARBOR TO HAVE SO MANY STRONG COOPERATIVES, YOU KNOW, WE ALL -- MANY OF US HAVE HISTORIES WITH CO-OPS HERE IN TOWN AND I'M PROUD TO MAKE THIS PROCLAMATION FOR CO-OPS AS A CONSEQUENCE. WHEREAS, COOPERATIVES ARE A UNIQUE FORM OF COLLABORATIVE BUSINESS WHERE MEMBERS OWN, USE, AND RUN THEIR OWN BUSINESSES NOT FOR PROFIT, BUT FOR THE COLLECTIVE GOOD OF MEMBERS; AND WHEREAS, COOPERATIVE BUSINESSES ARE OPERATED ACCORDING TO THE ROCHDALE PRINCIPLES, RECOGNIZED AND USED BY CO-OPS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, WHICH INCLUDE: VOLUNTARY AND OPEN MEMBERSHIP; DEMOCRATIC MEMBER CONTROL (1 PERSON 1 VOTE); MEMBERS' ECONOMIC PARTICIPATION (LIMITED RETURN ON INVESTMENT, REBATES IN PROPORTION TO USAGE); AUTONOMY AND  INDEPENDENCE; EDUCATION, TRAINING AND INFORMATION (FOR MEMBERS AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC, ABOUT THE BENEFITS AND PRACTICES OF COOPERATION); COOPERATION AMONG COOPERATIVES; AND CONCERN FOR COMMUNITY; AND WHEREAS, THERE ARE 40,000 COOPERATIVE BUSINESSES IN THE UNITED STATES, SERVING MORE THAN 346 MILLION MEMBERS IN NEARLY EVERY SECTOR OF THE ECONOMY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO: PRODUCER, AGRICULTURE, FINANCE, PURCHASING, CHILD CARE, ENERGY AND UTILITIES, HOUSING, FOOD, EDUCATION, RETAIL, WORKER, AND MORE; AND WHEREAS, THERE ARE COOPERATIVE BUSINESSES THROUGHOUT ANN ARBOR, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE INTER-COOPERATIVE COUNCIL OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, FOREST HILLS COOPERATIVE HOUSING, ARROWWOOD HILLS COOPERATIVE HOUSING, COLONIAL SQUARE COOPERATIVE; PINELAKE VILLAGE COOPERATIVE; ANN ARBOR COOPERATIVE NURSERY, STONE SCHOOL COOPERATIVE NURSERY, FIRST UNITED METHODIST COOPERATIVE NURSERY; UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN CREDIT UNION, HURON RIVER AREA CREDIT UNION; AND THE PEOPLE'S FOOD CO-OP; AND WHEREAS, OCTOBER IS CO-OP MONTH, FIRST SO DESIGNATED IN 1948 BY AND CELEBRATED BY CO-OPS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES AS A TIME TO HONOR THE SERVICE TO THEIR MEMBERS AND THEIR COMMUNITIES PROVIDED BY COOPERATIVE BUSINESSES. NOW THEREFORE, I, CHRISTOPHER TAYLOR, MAYOR OF ANN ARBOR, MICHIGAN, ON BEHALF OF THE CITY COUNCIL AND CITIZENS OF ANN ARBOR, DO HEREBY OFFICIALLY HONOR THE COOPERATIVE BUSINESSES THAT SERVE THE ANN ARBOR COMMUNITY, AND ENCOURAGE CITY RESIDENTS TO EXPLORE THE BENEFITS AVAILABLE THROUGH COOPERATIVE BUSINESSES BY PROCLAIMING THE MONTH OF OCTOBER AS "CO-OP MONTH" IN THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. [ APPLAUSE ]
00:06:00.236: >> I AM JUST SAY SOMETHING QUICKLY ON BEHALF OF THE INTERCOOPERATIVE COUNCIL. IT'S BEEN SUCH A GREAT COMMUNITY FOR ME TO LIVE IN A CO-OP. THAT'S WHY I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CONTINUE AS A STUDENT IN THE COOPERATIVE HOUSING GROUP. CO-OPS ARE VERY IMPORTANT AND THANK YOU FOR HONORING US THIS MONTH.
00:06:18.621: >> YES, I JUST WANT TO SAY WE RECENTLY CELEBRATED 75 YEARS OF INCORPORATION THIS PAST WEEKEND. SO WE HAD CO-OPERS FROM THE PAST TO THE '60s AND '50s COME MEET WITH US. IT WAS REALLY WONDERFUL. AND I THINK 50 ESPECIALLY GIVEN THIS TIME, SOMETHING LIKE THIS WHERE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CAN BE SO HARD TO COME BY, IT'S REALLY GREAT THAT YOU ARE RECOGNIZING OUR -- WHAT WE ARE DOING. SO THANK YOU. WE NOW COME TO PUBLIC COMMENT RESERVE TIME. PUBLIC COMMENT RESERVE TIME IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO SPEAK TO COUNCIL AND THE COMMUNITY ABOUT MATTERS OF MUNICIPAL INTEREST. TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT RESERVE TIME, ONE NEEDS TO HAVE SIGNED UP IN ADVANCE BY CONTACTING OUR CITY CLERK. SPEAKERS HAVE THREE MINUTES IN WHICH TO SPEAK. SO PLEASE PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE TIME CLOCK. AS A MATTER OF COURTESY, WE MAY HAVE ONLY ONE PERSON SPEAKING AT A TIME. AND FINALLY, IF YOU REQUIRE ASSISTANCE IN SPEAKING BEFORE COUNCIL TODAY, WE WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO PROVIDE IT TO YOU. OUR FIRST SPEAKER IS ETHEL POTTS.
00:07:43.706: >> HELLO. I'M SPEAKING ON ABOUT THE ANN ASHLEY PARKING STRUCTURE. I'M A LITTLE BIT LATE DEALING WITH IT, YOU HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH IT FORSOMETIME AND I'M A LITTLE LATE TO COME IN WITH OPINIONS BUT IT'S NOT FINALIZED YET. YOU HAVE ANOTHER STEP OR TWO TO DO. FIRST THING YOU SHOULD DO, I THINK, IS MAKE SURE THAT THE DEVELOPERS PROVIDE ENOUGH PARKING FOR WHATEVER THEY ARE BUILDING, AND NOT -- AND NOT EXCUSE THEM FOR PROVIDING THEIR OWN AMOUNT OF PARKING. THE SECOND IMPORTANT THING IS I WANT TO GO BACK TO THE 10-YEAR-OLD TRANSPORTATION PLAN FOR ANN ARBOR. IT WAS A VERY GOOD PLAN. IT HEAVILY FEATURED PARK AND RIDE LOTS AND THOSE HAVE NOT HAPPENED. WE HAVE ONLY HAD A COUPLE SINCE THEN, BUT THE A.A.T.A. AT THAT TIME VOLUNTEERED TO CREATE AND MANAGE PARK AND RIDE LOTS WITH FREQUENT SHUTTLE BUSES TO ALL THE DESTINATIONS IN TOWN. DRIVERS OF CARS WHO HAVE JOBS OR BUSINESS IN TOWN OR AT THE UNIVERSITY WOULD BE ABLE TO AVOID HAVING TO MEET -- GO THROUGH ALL THE RUSH HOURS AND HAVE TO THEN TRY TO FIND A PARKING PLACE IN TOWN. IT WOULD -- I THINK THEY WOULD BE VERY POPULAR. THIS IS WHERE OUR FUNDS SHOULD GO, NOT TO PUT MORE LAYERS ON ANOTHER PARKING STRUCTURE, BUT TO BUILD MORE PARK AND RIDE LOTS OUT AT THE EDGE OF TOWN TO KEEP AS MANY CARS AS POSSIBLE OUT OF TOWN SO WE DON'T HAVE TO PROVIDE PARKING STRUCTURES FOR THEM IF WE KEEP THEM OUT OF TOWN. WE HAVE RECENTLY ADDED A COUPLE OF PARK AND RIDE LOTS TO OUR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM, BUT THAT'S NOT ENOUGH. WE HAVE SOMETHING LIKE 20 ENTRANCES TO THE CITY. IF YOU ARE GOING TO ADD MORE FLOORS TO OUR PARKING, IT SHOULD BE SECOND AND THIRD FLOORS ON THE PARK AND RIDE LOTS. IF THEY WERE -- IF THEY WERE -- I'M SURE THEY WOULD BE POPULAR ENOUGH SO WE WOULD BE ADDING FLOORS TO THEM. ARE WE SERIOUS ENOUGH ABOUT MANAGING OUR CARS? I DON'T THINK WE'RE MANAGING TRAFFIC OR PARKING OR CARS HE IS WELL IN THIS CITY. -- CARS VERY WELL IN THIS CITY. LET'S SEE HOW MANY CARS WE CAN KEEP FROM ACTUALLY COMING INTO THE CITY, BUT THE PEOPLE WHO NEED TO BE HERE COULD STILL BE HERE. ADDING TO ANN ASHLEY I DON'T THINK IS THE SOLUTION.
00:10:21.864: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS BLAINE COLEMAN.
00:10:33.409: >> WE'RE FORTUNATE -- WE ARE FORTUNATE TO HAVE A LOT OF STUDENTS FROM SKYLINE HIGH SCHOOL HERE TONIGHT. YOU LEARN THINGS IN HIGH SCHOOL ABOUT THE NATION AND THE WORLD THAT WILL STICK WITH YOU FOR A LIFETIME. AND ONE OF THE THINGS YOU MAY HAVE ALREADY LEARNED IS LINCOLN'S HOUSE DIVIDED SPEECH. HAVE YOU LEARNED THAT YET IN SCHOOL? YOU WILL LIKE THAT. SO WHAT LINCOLN SAID AROUND 1858, A HOUSE THAT'S DIVIDED AGAINST ITSELF CANNOT STAND. IT CAN NOT BE PART SLAVE AND PART FREE. IT HAS TO BE ALL ONE THING OR ALL ANOTHER. AND THIS WAS AN ARGUMENT AGAINST SLAVERY, BECAUSE HE BELIEVED AND HE WAS RIGHT THAT SLAVERY WOULD GOBBLE UP THE COUNTRY UNLESS THE COUNTRY STOPPED SLAVERY FROM GROWING. NOW, I CAN'T SEE HOW THE UNITED STATES CAN GO ON GIVING $38 BILLION TO A VERY VIOLENT, RACIST STATE LIKE ISRAEL, TO KEEP KILLING THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE. HOW THE UNITED STATES CAN KEEP DOING THAT AND STILL CALL ITSELF A DEMOCRACY. ALREADY THERE ARE MANY LAWS SEEKING TO CRIMINALIZE WHAT I HAVE BEEN SAYING HERE FOR 17 YEARS, WHICH IS BOYCOTT ISRAEL. A LOT OF LAWS HAVE BEEN PASSED IN MOST STATES, INCLUDING MICHIGAN, THAT SEEK TO GIVE THE IMPRESSION THAT IT'S A CRIME TO ASK FOR BOYCOTT OR OTHER ACTION AGAINST ISRAEL. SO IF THE UNITED STATES KEEPS ON SUPPORTING THIS VIOLENT, RACIST STATE OF ISRAEL, WITH $38 BILLION, LIKE IT'S BEEN DOING, I DON'T SEE HOW THE UNITED STATES IS GOING TO STAY A DEMOCRACY, BECAUSE THEY ARE ALREADY GOING -- THE U.S. AND THE INDIVIDUAL STATES ARE ALREADY GOING HEADLONG TOWARDS TRYING TO CRIMINAL SIZE THIS KIND OF SPEECH, DEMANDING ACTION AGAINST ISRAEL. BOYCOTT ISRAEL, DIVEST FROM ISRAEL. STOP GIVING MILITARY AID TO ISRAEL. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE SAY THESE THINGS BECAUSE THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO GET ISRAEL TO STOP PULLING THE TRIGGER ON THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE. ISRAEL HAS MASSACRED THOUSANDS OF PALESTINIANS. ISRAEL HAS SHOT DOWN THOUSANDS OF PALESTINIANS JUST IN THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF. FROM MARCH OF 2018 TO NOW, ISRAEL HAS ACTUALLY MURDERED HUNDREDS OF PALESTINIANS FROM MARCH OF 2018 UNTIL NOW. AND I URGE YOU AT SKYLINE, TO ASK YOUR TEACHERS TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT HOW MANY PALESTINIANS HAS ISRAEL KILLED AND CONSIDER EXACTLY ARE WE GIVING THEM AID.
00:13:33.722: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
00:13:34.957: >> WHY ARE WE GIVING ISRAEL AID?
00:13:37.059: >> Mayor Taylor: OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS MOZHGAN SAVABIEASFAHANI.
00:13:41.163: >> MY NAME IS MOZHGAN SAVABIEASFAHANI, AND I HAVE LIVED IN PALESTINE, AND TAUGHT YOUNG PEOPLE AS YOUNG AS YOURSELVES, AND I KNOW THE LIFE OF A PALESTINIAN. PALESTINIANS LIVE IN SHEER FEAR OF BEING KILLED, EVERY SINGLE DAY. CHILDREN ARE NOT IN WAY PROTECTED. THE MINUTE THEY LEAVE THEIR HOME, THEY COULD NEVER COME BACK. PARENTS COULD BE ARRESTED AT ANY TIME. ISRAELI MILITARY BREAKS INTO PEOPLE'S HOMES WITHOUT ANY DISCRIMINATION ARRESTING PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND EXPOSING THEM TO HORRIFIC, HORRIFIC EXPERIENCE OF BEING SNATCHED OUT OF THEIR HOMES INTO JAIL CELLS. ISRAEL KEEPS CHILDREN IN JAILS FOR -- WITHOUT ANY EXCUSE FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS AND YEARS AND YEARS. A LOT OF TIMES WHEN THEY RELEASE THE CHILDREN, THEY IMMEDIATELY SNATCH THEM THE NEXT DAY. INCREASING THEIR TORMENT AND THEIR TORTURE. ISRAEL IS A RACIST STATE. IT IS MURDERING A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE JUST LIKE YOURSELVES, SHOOTING THEM IN THE HEAD, THE FOOT. MANY, MANY PALESTINIAN YOUNG PEOPLE LIKE YOURSELVES HAVE HAD TO HAVE AMPUTATIONS. YOU WILL SEE HUNDREDS OF PICTURES OF THEM, WITHOUT ARMS, WITHOUT LEGS AND IMAGINE WHAT LIFE WOULD BE LIKE IF SOMEBODY JUST SHOT YOU BECAUSE YOU ARE AN ARAB, AND YOU LOST YOUR LEG. OR YOU LOST YOUR ARM. ON TOP OF ALL OF THAT, ISRAEL GETS MASSIVE MILITARY AID FROM THE UNITED STATES AND AS WE ALL KNOW, ONE OF THE MAJOR MAJOR REASONS FOR GLOBAL REASONS IS MILITARY ACTIVITY AND MILITARY EXPENDITURE. U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE IS THE BIGGEST POLLUTER OF THIS EARTH AND THE BIGGEST ORGANIZATION THAT IS PUSHING THE WORLD TOWARDS MORE AND MORE EHEATED ATMOSPHERE. SO THERE'S A LOT OF REASONS TO BOYCOTT ISRAEL, TO STOP THE U.S. FROM SPENDING BILLIONS EACH YEAR ON THIS RACIST STATE. RACIST ZIONIST STATE. AND I WANT TO TELL THESE YOUNG PEOPLE ONE MORE THING, YOU ARE ALL HEADED TO UNIVERSITIES AND YOU ARE ALL THINKING HOW AM I GOING TO PAY FOR IT. WELL, DECEMB GUESS WHAT, ISRAELE FREE EDUCATION. HOW DO THEY PAY FOR IT, BY YOUR TAXES? YES, THE TAXES THAT YOU PAY GOES STRAIGHT TO ISRAEL, AND IT FUNDS THEIR SYSTEM OF EDUCATION, WHICH IS FREE-FOR-ALL JEWISH PEOPLE THERE. NOT FOR ARABS. BUT WHAT I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU IS THIS:  WE AS PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THIS COUNT I E COUNTRY AND P, WE ARE FUNDING AN ATROCIOUS STATE. WE SHOULD BOYCOTT ISRAEL. AT THE VERY LEAST, STOP SENDING THEM MILITARY. AT THE VERY, VERY LEAST.
00:16:55.190: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS LISA ABRAMS.
00:17:13.075: >> GOOD EVENING. CAN YOU HEAR ME? OKAY. I'M SPEAKING TONIGHT ON BEHALF OF FRIENDS OF ANN ARBOR WILDLIFE AND NATURE, KNOWN AS FAAWN AND ALL CITIZENS COMMITTED TO NONVIOLENCE IN THOUGHTS, WORDS AND ACTIONS TO PLEASE RECONSIDER YOUR DECISION TO KILL 150 DEER THIS COMING WINTER IN ANN ARBOR. PLEASE PROTECT THE WILDLIFE, INCLUDING ALL THE DEER IN ANN ARBOR. THERE WAS A RECENT INTERVIEW WITH JANE GOODALL, THE PRIMATOLOGIST, ANTHROPOLOGIST KNOWN FOR HER STUDY OF CHIMPANZEES AND ANIMAL WELFARE. SHE RECOMMENDED TO ALL OF US COMMITTED TO PROTECTING WILDLIFE ON THIS PLANET, THAT THE WAY TO SPEAK WITH PUBLIC OFFICIALS IS THROUGH OUR HEARTS BECAUSE WORDS FROM THE HEART GO TO THE HEART. AND THAT IS MY INTENTION THIS EVENING. EACH LIFE ON THIS EARTH HAS A UNIQUE PLACE THAT HELPS TO US CONTRIBUTE TO OUR ECOSYSTEM. IT'S ONLY THROUGH OUR HEARTS THAT THE KILLING AND THE VIOLENCE WILL END. IT'S ONLY THROUGH OUR HEARTS WE WILL SEE THE MADNESS AND JUSTIFICATION MADE FOR KILLING IN THE NAME OF METRICS AND SAFETY. IT IS ONLY THROUGH OUR HEARTS THAT WE WILL SEE THAT EVERY LIFE IS A GIFT ON THIS PLANET, AND WE HAVE NO RIGHT TO TAKE ITS LIFE AWAY. IT IS ONLY THROUGH OUR HEARTS THAT WE CAN FORGIVE ONE ANOTHER FOR PERCEIVED WRONGDOINGS. AND IT IS ONLY THROUGH OUR HEARTS THAT WE TRANSFORM PERCEIVED PROBLEMS INTO NONVIOLENT SOLUTIONS. IT IS ONLY THROUGH OUR HEARTS THAT WE EXPERIENCE PEACE AND WHEN WE EXPERIENCE PEACE, WE FEEL OUR ONENESS AND OUR CONNECTIONS WITH ALL LIFE AND WE WANT TO PROTECT ALL LIFE AND EXTEND PEACE EVERYWHERE. THANK YOU.
00:19:27.008: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OTHER COMMUNICATIONS TODAY FROM COUNCIL? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
00:19:34.082: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES, THANK YOU. JUST REAL QUICK, I WAS AT THE EBER WHITE PLAYGROUND CEREMONY YESTERDAY, AND IT WAS A GREAT SITE. IT WAS GOOD TO SEE COMMUNITY COME TO GO AND PITCH IN IN ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT WAYS AND IT WAS A SIGHT TO BE SEEN AND I'M SURE THERE'S PICTURES OUT THERE OF IT, BUT SHOUT OUT TO THE FOLKS THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THAT SUCCESS. AND GLAD THE FOLKS IN THE CO-OP SHOWED UP TO RECEIVE THEIR AWARD AND RECOGNITION. KENDAL CCO-OPS ARE VERYIMPORTANT WAYS. YOU ALWAYS GET TO SEE PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY COMING TO ANN ARBOR, WHEN -- WHEN THEY GET TOGETHER AND THE HISTORIC CONTRIBUTIONS THEY HAVE TO THE LABOR MOVEMENT, TO DEMOCRATIC VALUES, TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING, OBVIOUSLY, TO A DIFFERENT WAY OF LIVING OTHER THAN MONETIZING EVERYTHING. SO IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE THAT. AND I HOPE IT CONTINUES FOR A LONG TIME TO COME.
00:20:43.818: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. I WANT TO THANK COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN FOR HELPING TO FACILITATE OUR SECOND MEET AND GREET IN WARD 3, WHICH WILL HAPPEN TOMORROW EVENING AT 7 P.M. AT THE BRYANT COMMUNITY CENTER. IT'S A MEET AND GREET WITH POLICE CHIEF COX AND SOME OTHER POLICE OFFICERS. SO IT'S NOT JUST OPEN TO THOSE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD, OPEN TO ANYONE IN THE COMMUNITY WHO WANTS TO COME OUT AND MEET THE CHIEF AND SOME OTHER OFFICERS AND TALK ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY IN ANN ARBOR. AND I WILL BE THERE. I WANT TO THANK A.P.S. TRUSTEES SUSAN BASKETT FOR FACILITATING THAT MEETING AS WELL.
00:21:26.861: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
00:21:27.729: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU, MAYOR. I APPRECIATE THE PROCLAMATION OF CO-OPS. I GUESS MAYBE IT'S JUST BECAUSE I LIVE IN ANN ARBOR, I BELIEVE IN THE SPIRIT OF THEM. I WAS COUNTING BACK HOW MANY TIMES -- HOW LONG I HAVE BEEN IN THE PEOPLE'S FOOD CO-OP. OUR KIDS WENT TO FUM. FUMPKIN AND I HAVE BEEN IN THE CREDIT UNION SINCE THE '80s. IT'S ESPECIALLY INTERESTING WHEN YOU SAY A CO-OP IS FORMED NOT FOR PROFIT BUT FOR THE COLLECTIVE GOOD OF ITS MEMBERS. AND IF EVER THERE WAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK TO SOLUTIONS FOR THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS HERE IN THE CITY, IT WOULD BE THE CO-OP ANDWOOD PROVES THAT EVERY DAY. I KNOW IT'S NOT THE KIND OF THING THAT WE CAN CREATE ZONINGS JUST FOR CO-OPS BUT WISH WE COULD. THEY ARE AN EXCELLENT MODEL AND THEY REALLY GIVE PEOPLE A CHANCE. REAL QUICK SOME ANNOUNCEMENTS, NOVEMBER 6th -- I KNOW IT'S A COUPLE OF WEEKS OUT BUT NOVEMBEF THE CITY CENTER TASK FORCE PUBLIC OUTREACH. WE HAD MANY PRIVATE PUBLIC OUTREACHES TO VARIOUS GROUPS INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS, NEIGHBORS AND SO ON. NOVEMBER 6th FROM 6 TO 8 P.M. AT THE DOWNTOWN LIBRARY, ON THE FOURTH FLOOR, EVERYONE IS INVITED TO LEARN WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE TASK FORCE AND THE PROJECT AND SHARE THEIR THOUGHTS ON CREATING A COMMONS IN THE CITY AND ALSO TO STAY IN CONTACT AND IN TOUCH WITH US AND SIGN UP TO CONTINUE TO GIVE YOUR INPUT AND CONTINUE TO BE INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS. AND SO EVERYONE IS WELCOME TO THAT. NOVEMBER 13th, THERE'S ALSO AN A2 CARBON NEUTRALITY. THE COUNTY PASSED AN ACTION OVER CLIMATE ACTION AND THAT MIGHT BE A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO GET OUT THERE AND LISTEN AND LEARN AND ALSO SHARE. THANK YOU.
00:23:19.441: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER COMMUNICATION FROM COUNCIL. COUNCILMEMBER NELSON?
00:23:22.010: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I JUST WANT TO ECHO PRAISE FOR OUR PUBLIC WORKS DEPARTMENT FOR THE OPEN HOUSE THAT THEY PUT ON ON SATURDAY. MY KIDS AND I WENT AND WE HAD A FABULOUS TIME. I MEAN, IT REALLY WAS A WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL THING. AND SORT OF ALONG THE LINES OF WHAT COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI SAID. MY OWN KIDS WENT TO EBER WHITE AND MY HUSBAND AND I HELPED TO WORK ON THE PLAYGROUND LAST WEEK. I WANTED TO GIVE A SHOUT OUT TO OUR SUSTAINABILITY DEPARTMENT. I UNDERSTAND THAT EBER WHITE GOT ONE OF THE SUSTAINABLE GRANTS TO HELP BUILD THAT PLAYGROUND. THIS WEEK, I SAW A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES OF THE CITY WORKING TOGETHER MAKE GOOD THINGS HAPPEN.
00:24:04.686: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
00:24:05.587: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES, I WANT TO REPORT ON THREE THINGS. A WEEK AND A HAL HALF AGO, I WEO A VISION ZERO CONFERENCE IN NEW YORK. MY CHILDREN PAID FOR IT AND NOT THE CITY. I WAS TREATED LIKE A CELEBRITY. THERE WERE PEOPLE FROM THE EAST COAST AND PEOPLE FROM THE WEST COAST, BUT I ACTUALLY WORE MY U OF M JACKET AND THE FACT THAT SOMEONE FROM THE CAR CAPITAL OF THE WORLD AS INTERESTED IN PEDESTRIAN SAFETY, WAS OF INTEREST. I LEARNED A LOT AT THIS CONFERENCE AND I'M HOPING TO HAVE A COMMUNITY CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS IN THE NEAR FUTURE SO THAT WE CAN EDUCATE THE PUBLIC AND ALSO GATHER INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THE PUBLIC CONSIDERS PRIORITIES. NUMBER TWO, I FOUND IT INTERESTING THAT AN ARTICLE IN "THE NEW YORK TIMES," THE HEADLINE WAS "IN ANN ARBOR THE STUDENT NEWSPAPER IS THE ONLY NEWSPAPER." THE SAME WEEKEND, MLIVE HAD AN ARTICLE BY RYAN STANTON ABOUT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN STUDENTS TAKING PART IN A SOLAR PANEL INSTALLATION ON TOP OF OUR FIRE STATION. SO OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE MORE THAN ONE NEWSPAPER IN ANN ARBOR AND I WANT TO THANK RYAN STANTON. I KNOW HE HAS A LOT TO COVER. HE'S ONLY ONE REPORTER. THE THIRD THING IS IN THE PACKET LELEGISTAR, UNDER THE POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING TOMORROW, IS A COPY OF THE LETTER THAT WAS SENT BY THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR TO OUR LOCAL STATE REPRESENTATIVES STATING SUPPORT FOR THE STATE CROSSWALK LAW FROM COUNCIL. I CAN TALK AT BREAK IN ANYONE WANTS FURTHER INFORMATION ON THAT.
00:26:00.401: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER COMMUNICATION FROM COUNCIL. COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
00:26:02.937: >> Councilmember Bannister:  I WANTED TO GIVE A THANK YOU TO CHIEF COX AND HIS THREE OFFICERS WHO CAME OUT TO ARROWWOOD. IT WAS A GREAT MEETING BEING THANKS TO THE ARROWWOOD PEOPLE, REBECCA AND JAMES DANIEL FOR ORGANIZING THAT AND ALSO FOR CHIEF COX FOR COMING OUT AND MEETING EVERYONE, REMINDING US THAT POLICE OFFICERS ARE HUMAN TOO. AND WE SHOULD ALL SAY HI TO THEM AND REACH OUT. I ALSO WANT TO THANK MISSY STULTS AND THE OFFICE OF SUSTAINABILITY AND INNOVATION AND THE U OF M STUDENTS WHO HELPED US PUT SOLAR PANELS ON THE FIRE STATION DOWN BY BRIARWOOD LAST FRIDAY. THEY WORKED THURSDAY AND FRIDAY, AND SO NOW THAT FIRE STATION WILL BE CARBON NEUTRAL FOR MOST PART AND ALL FOR ONLY $74,000 IN SOLAR PANELS. SO THAT WAS ANOTHER BIG SUCCESS STORY. AND THEN LASTLY, I JUST WANT TO REMIND EVERYONE, YOU ARE ALL INVITED TO JOY THE OLD 4 4th WARD ASSOCIATION TOMORROW NIGHT FROM 7 P.M. TO 9 P.M. WHERE COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER AND I WILL BE THERE AND WE'LL BE TALKING WITH THE GROUP ABOUT ZONING ISSUES, PARKING ISSUES, AND SHORT-TERM RENTALS. AND THE PUBLIC IS WELCOMED TO JOIN US AT ST. ANDREW'S CHURCH ON NORTH DIVISION. THANK YOU.

00:29:02.250: >> Councilmember Lumm: I WOULD LIKE TO PULL CA-4.
00:29:08.356: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE AGENDA?
00:29:11.592: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WOULD LIKE TO SAY CA-6, I'M GLAD WE HAVE A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT WITH THE FIRE. I APPRECIATE THAT AND I APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S SERVICE IN THOSE AREAS.
00:29:25.439: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
00:29:26.440: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WANT TO POINT OUT CA-7 A RESOLUTION TO ACCEPT A SIDEWALK EASEMENT AT NARROW GOUGEWAY NATURE AREA AND THAT WILL ALLOW A SIDEWALK TO BE PUT IN IN A SCHOOL WALK ZONE AREA. IT'S ACTUALLY CITY PROPERTY AND HOPEFULLY THAT SIDEWALK WILL BE PUT IN THIS FALL. COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
00:29:48.830: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  I WANT TO SAY THANKS FOR ALL THE WORK ON CA-3. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WE WILL BE RELEASING MONEY FROM OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUND, WITH NEW TAX DOLLARS THAT COME TO US THROUGH THE COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH MILLAGE. IT'S AN EXCITING OPPORTUNITY AND I APPRECIATE THE PARTNERSHIP WITH AVALON HOUSING. FURTHER DISCUSSION. OF THE AGENDA WITHOUT THE CA-4. [CHORUS OF AYES] IT'S APPROVED WITH 11 COUNCILMEMBERS PRESENT, ALL VOTING IN THE AFFIRMATIVE THUS SATISFYING THE EIGHT VOTE REQUIREMENT FOR CA-2, CA-5 AND CA-7. CA-4, RESOLUTION TO INCREASE COMMUNITY SERVICES AUTHORIZED STAFFING LEVEL, 55,296. MOVED BY LUMM AN SECONDED BY HAYNER. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
00:30:43.017: >> Councilmember Lumm: THIS IS THE RESOLUTION TO INCREASE COMMUNITY SERVICES AUTHORIZED STAFFING LEVEL BY ONE FTE. FOR FISCAL YEAR '20, WE ADDED 14 FULL-TIME EMPLOYEES TO THE CITY BUDGET. AND OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS WE ADDED 30 FTEs. YES, 30! THAT IS A HUGE NUMBER AND NEW FULL-TIME CITY EMPLOYEES AN A SIGNIFICANT PERMANENT STRUCTURAL COST COMMITMENT. IT ROUGHLY REPRESENTS $3 MILLION A YEAR ADDITIONALLY. NOW HERE WE ARE THREE PLUS MONTHS INTO THIS FISCAL YEAR AND WE ARE BEING ASKED TO ANOTHER ANOTHER FULL-TIME PERMANENT EMPLOYEE. ADDING FTEs DURING THE YAO ERR S POOR BUDGET DISCIPLINE AND IT'S ESPECIALLY POOR PROCESS WHEN WE ARE THREE AND A HALF MONTHS INTO THE FISCAL YEAR. WE RARELY USED TO DO IT. NOW IT SEEMS WE DO IT FREQUENTLY. INSTEAD OF A FIRM BINDING DOCUMENT, THE BUDGET HAS BECOME A SUGGESTED STARTING POINT, THAT COUNCIL JUST ADDS TO DURING THE YEAR. EMERGENCIES ARE ONE THING. BUT ADDING RESOURCES FOR NORMAL BUSINESS ACTIVITIES THIS SOON INTO THE FISCAL YEAR, IS NOT THE KIND OF FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY I BELIEVE WE NEED TO MAINTAIN. WE HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY RAMPED UP SPENDING AND RESOURCES FOR THE SUSTAINABILITY OFFICE AND CLIMATE ACTION PROGRAMS THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS. WHAT WAS AN EXPENDITURE BUDGET OF ROUGHLY $400,000 OR SO THREE YEARS AGO, IS NOW A $1.8 MILLION SPENDING BUDGET IN AN OFFICE WITH FIVE FULL-TIME EMPLOYEES. WE ADDED  $880,000 IN NEW SPENDING AND ANOTHER FTE IN THE CLIMATE ACTION PROGRAMMING AND THAT WAS LARGELY BASED ON THE FIVE-YEAR PLAN WE REVIEWED IN MAY. A PLAN WE APPLAUDED FOR ITS THOROUGHNESS. NOW WE ARE THREE PLUS MONTHS INTO THE FISCAL YEAR AND WE ARE TOLD WE NEED TO AMEND THAT BUDGET TO ADD ANOTHER COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT SPECIALIST, SHARED WENT THE SUSTAINABILITY OFFICE AND THE BUILDING DEPARTMENT. EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE ONE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT OFFICE IN THE SUSTAINABILITY OFFICE AND EVEN THOUGH THERE WERE THREE EXTRA PEOPLE IN THE BUILDING DEPARTMENT AND ONE IN THE SUSTAINABILITY OFFICE. ANYWAY, I'M SURE THIS ITEM WILL PASS AND I SUSPECT, I WILL BE THE ONLY PERSON TO VOTE NO. MY COLLEAGUES WILL LIKELY SAY AMENDING THE BUDGET IS OKAY AND NOT A BIG DEAL, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S FOR CLIMATE ACTION PROGRAMMING. I JUST DO NOT AGREE. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THE PURPOSE IS. I BELIEVE IN AMENDING THE BUDGET THREE PLUS MONTHS INTO THE YEAR FOR A NONEMERGENCY, NORMAL BUSINESS ITEM DEMONSTRATES A LACK OF BUDGET DISCIPLINE, AND COMPROMISES OUR ANNUAL BUDGETING PROCESS SO I WILL BE VOTING NO ON CA-4 AND THANK YOU FOR LISTENING. THANK YOU.
00:33:39.460: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
00:33:41.796: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. THE EXPENSE FOR THIS IS GOING TO BE SPLIT BETWEEN SUSTAINABILITY AND THE CONSTRUCTION FUND, AND I ALSO AGREE WITH WHAT COUNCILMEMBER LUMM IS SAYING ABOUT THE BUDGET, THE WAY THAT WE TREAT THE BUDGET SEEMS KIND OF FLEXIBLE AND IT'S A BIG BOOK. I DAH ARERY IT AROUND A LOT AND I GO THROUGH IT. THERE'S A LOT IN IT AND WE ALL READ IT AND WE ALL COMMIT TO IT. AND SO I -- I MAY BE WILL ONLY OTHER PERSON VOTING AGAINST THIS FOR THAT REASON ALONE. THE OTHER REASON I MIGHT IS BECAUSE THE CONSTRUCTION FUND FINDS ITSELF WITH A POSITIVE FUND BALANCE AND WHEN WE TALK TO FOLKS IN COMMUNITY SERVICES, ESPECIALLY IN THE BUILDING TRADES AND SO ON AND WE REACH OUT TO THESE COMMUNICATES AND WE ASK THEM, TOUSS DO YOU WANT US O LOWER YOUR RATES NEXT YEAR OR DO YOU WANT MORE SERVICE? THEY SAY THEY WANT MORE SERVICE. I THINK IT'S GREAT THAT THE CITY WILL PROVIDE THAT SERVICE AND I THINK IT'S GOOD ARE TO THE BILLERSEN ATHE DEVELOP -- THE BILLERS AND THE DEVELOPERS AND SO ON WHEN THEY CAN HAVE TIMELY INSPECTIONS AND TIMELY PLAN REVIEW AND SO ON. AND THAT'S GREAT. BUT I'M NOT SO SURE THAT THEY KNEW THAT THEY WERE GOING TO GET A SUSTAINABILITY PERSON. AND SO, YOU KNOW, THAT PEACE JUST KIND OF MY HALF REASON FOR NOT REALLY LOVING THIS OPTION HERE. SO, I JUST WANTED TO SHARE THAT WITH EVERYBODY, AND I THINK THAT SOME OF THE BIG LOW HANGING FRUIT IS TO BE HAD IN MAKING IMPROVEMENTS IN THE CURRENT RENTAL STOCK AND MAKING SURE THAT NEW HOUSES AND NEW DEVELOPMENTS ARE BUILT IN WAYS THAT OUR FUTURE-PROOFED AND THAT THEY ARE USING AS LITTLE ENERGY AS POSSIBLE. THAT SHOULD BE OUR GOALS FOR SURE. AND SO THAT'S WHY THAT'S -- THE OTHER HALF OF THAT IS GOOD FOR ME. I THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE GET THAT MESSAGE OUT. I'M NOT CERTAIN THIS IS THE GREATEST WAY TO DO, IT BUT I DO BELIEVE IT'S -- IT IS A WAY TO DO IT. AND THAT'S IMPORTANT TOO. SO THIS IS SORT OF ONE OF THOSE FLIP A COINS BUT I REALLY DON'T LIKE THE BUDGET DISCIPLINE ON THIS OBJECT. THANK YOU.
00:35:42.116: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI. RAM THANK YOU, MAYOR TAYLOR AND THANKS TO MY COLLEAGUES FOR OUTLINING SOME OF THE CONCERNS, WE ARE USING THE COUNTY HEALTH MILLAGE? MILLAGE IN WAYS THAT I DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE SPENDING THEM IN. THESE INSPECTIONS, THIS PERMITTING FOR RENTALS AND ALL THIS, NEEDS TO COME THROUGH THE CONSTRUCTION FEES AND THE PERMIT FEES AND IT SHOULD BE BAKED IN TO THE COSTS THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS. SO PERHAPS THE STAFF CAN HELP ME BETTER UNDERSTAND WHY THERE'S A NECESSITY TO SPLIT THIS 50/50, AND WHY DOESN'T IT ALL JUST COME FROM THE CONSTRUCTION AND PERMIT, YOU KNOW, FUND?
00:36:42.142: >> GOOD EVENING. COUNCIL, MAYOR, I WOULD LOVE TO TAKE A SHOT AT STARTING TO ANSWER THAT, AND MAYBE DISCUSSING A LITTLE BIT WHY THIS IS IN FRONT OF YOU. THE PROGRAM ITSELF IS ONE THAT WAS STARTED THROUGH THE SUSTAINABILITY OFFICE AND IS SOMETHING THAT THE ENTIRE STAFF FEELS COULD MOVE THE NEEDLE AS FAR AS SUSTAINABILITY IN THE COMMUNITY. HOW RENTAL -- THE RENTAL PROPERTIES AND HOW BUILDING CONSTRUCTION IS DONE IN THE CITY, HAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND SUSTAINABILITY WITHIN THE CITY. DURING OUR DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN THE TWO OFFICES -- AND WE ADMIT COUNCILWOMAN LUMM, THIS WAS NOT SOMETHING THAT WE DISCUSSED BEFORE THE BUDGET, IF NOT NOW, PROBABLY SOMETHING THAT WE WILL BRING FORWARD WITH THE BUDGET NEXT YEAR. WE FELT IT WAS IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO START THE DISCUSSION NOW AND WE WERE READY TO DISCUSS IT. IT'S PART OF THE ADOPTIVE SUSTAINABILITY PLAN AND SOMETHING THAT WE FEEL IF WE ARE GOING TO START TO INDUCE THESE DISCUSSIONS OR HAVE THESE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE BUILDING AND THE RENTAL COMMUNITY, IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WANT A DEDICATED STAFF PERSON. IN OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH BRAGG AND WITH W.A.3 AND THE DEPARTMENT ASSOCIATION, ONE OF THE THINGS THEY SAID TO US IS IF THEY ARE GOING TO ENACT ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS ON THEM, ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES OR ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS AS FAR AS INSPECTIONS OR CERTIFICATIONS FOR RENTAL OR BUILDING, IS THAT THERE BE DEDICATED STAFF OR DEDICATED RESOURCES THERE AVAILABLE TO THEM, TO HELP THEM THROUGH THAT PROCESS. SO THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED AS PART OF THE STRATEGY. IT'S SOMETHING WE FEEL IS IMPORTANT, AND IF WE ARE GOING TO GO FORWARD WITH IS IT'S SOMETHING WE FELT WAS REASONABLE TO REACH OUT TO NOW AND TALK ABOUT ADDING THAT STAFF RESOURCE FOR THE COMMUNITY, AS OPPOSED TO WAITING FOR THE BUDGET. WE WOULD BE GLAD TO DISCUSS WHEN THE BUDGET COMES UP NEXT YEAR AND SOMETHING WE WOULD BE GLAD TO BRING FORWARD NEXT YEAR. WE HAVE NOT BROUGHT OUT AN OUT-OF-CYCLE F.T.E. BEFORE. WE UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT, BUT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS DEFINED AND WE WANT TO GET STARTED NOW. SO WE FELT IT WAS WORTH THE DISCUSSION AND POTENTIALLY WORTH BRINGING ON THE ADDITIONAL F.T.E. NOW AS OPPOSED TO WAITING UNTIL NEXT FISCAL YEAR. SO THAT'S WHY WE ARE HERE AS FAR AS THE BILLING AND RENTAL PART OF IT OR THE COMMUNITY SERVICES, IS WE FEEL IF WE ARE GOING TO START THIS PROGRAM, AND START TO ENACT THIS PROGRAM, THAT HAVING THAT DEDICATED RESOURCE IS IMPORTANT. IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT COUNCIL WOULD RATHER WAIT UNTIL NEXT YEAR TO START THE DISCUSSION ON, WE WOULD BE GLAD TO DO THAT. WE FEEL THE PROGRAM IS DEFINED AND IF WE ARE GOING TO GET STARTED ON, IT THAT THERE WAS REALLY NO REASON NOT TO HAVE THAT DISCUSSION ABOUT THE F.T.E. NOW.
00:39:27.708: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I APPRECIATE THE SENSE OF URGENCY. WE HAVE HEARD THAT FROM ALL OF OUR -- I HAVE A WHOLE 30 SECONDS OR SOMETHING LEFT. THAT WE APPRECIATE THE URGENCY. WE DON'T WANT TO WAIT A YEAR. MY MAIN CONCERN IS WHY IS NOT COMING FROM YOUR DEPARTMENT 100%? I MEAN, IF THESE -- IF THESE BUILDERS -- WE GOT A SURPLUS IN THAT ACCOUNT, LET'S SPEND IT. LET'S SPEND IT ON THE PROGRAMS THAT IT ADMINISTERS. WHY DOES IT HAVE TO COME FROM THE COUNTY HEALTH MILLAGE MONEY? THAT IS A STICKING POINT.
00:40:00.374: >> I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT. THE CONSTRUCTION FUND CAN ONLY BE USED FOR ITEMS DIRECTLY RELATED TO PERMIT ISSUANCE OR INSPECTION. THEY CAN'T BE USED FOR EDUCATION. THEY CAN'T BE USED FOR A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT THIS PROGRAM INVOLVES. WE ARE TAKING OUR BEST GUESS AT THIS POINT, WITHOUT ACTUALLY HAVING STARTED THE PROGRAM THAT THE SPLIT BETWEEN THE STAFF PERSON'S TIME WILL BE APPROXIMATELY 50% RELATED TO PERMITTING, INSPECTION, AND BUILDING AND RENTAL-RELATED ACTIVITIES THAT COME IN THROUGH A PERMIT FEE. ONLY THAT INVOLVEMENT CAN COME OUT OF THE CONSTRUCTION FUND. THE REST OF THE INVOLVEMENT FROM SUSTAINABILITY AS FAR AS EDUCATION, OUTREACH, AND OTHER THINGS CAN'T BE PAID FOR THROUGH THE CONSTRUCTION FUND. SO THAT WOULD BE A VIOLATION OF BOLT AND A LOT OF OTHER THINGS THAT GO INTO THIS. SO WE ARE TAKING OUR BEST GUESS RIGHT NOW THAT THIS STAFF PERSON'S TIME WILL BE SPLIT 50/50, EQUALLY. THERE'S A VERY GOOD CHANCE, AS THE PROGRAM EVOLVES, WE WILL COME BACK AND RECOMMEND THAT THERE'S A DIFFERENT DIVISION OF TIME BETWEEN THE TWO RESOURCES. BUT RIGHT NOW, AT OUR BEST ESTIMATE, IT WILL BE ABOUT 50/50 BETWEEN THE TWO ITEMS.
00:41:12.713: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, VERY QUICKLY, THE BUDGET FROM SUSTAINABILITY IS NOT FROM THE MENTAL HEALTH MILLAGE. THE BUDGET SAVINGS IS FROM THE GENERAL FUND AND IT'S BECAUSE TWO OF REASONS, ONE, IT'S TAKEN A VERY LONG TIME TO GET THROUGH OUR HIRING PROCESS AND SO WE SAT ON A LOT OF EXTRA BUDGET. AND THE SECOND IS BECAUSE WE ANTICIPATED HIRING AT A LEVEL AND WE ACTUALLY BROUGHT PEOPLE SLIGHTLY IN ARE THAT. SO WE HAVE BUDGET SAVINGS. NONE OF IT IS ACTUALLY FROM THE
00:41:37.204: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER -
00:41:42.142: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: IT'S IN THE AR RESOLUTION?
00:41:47.881: >> IT'S OR MISTAKE THEN. THAT IS NOT TRUE IN TERMS OF HOW WE HAVE HOUR BUDGET -- I WILL ATTACH THIS FOR EVERYONE, OUR SAVINGS WE WORKED WITH THE FINANCE DEPARTMENT THAT ACTUALLY TRACKS WHERE YOU WILL ATHE MONEY AND THE SAVINGS IS COMING FROM.
00:41:59.159: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANKS FOR BEING HERE TO ANSWER THOSE.
00:42:02.963: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
00:42:05.365: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THAT SPOKE TO IT. IF THESE DOLLARS REASON COMING, WOULD YOU RECOMMEND STRIKING THE WHEREAS [ APPLAUSE ] THAT REFERS TO THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH -- WHEREAS CLAUSE THAT REFERS TO THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH MILLAGE. I WOULD LOOK TO OUR ACTING CITY MANAGER, WHO IS OUR C.F.O. JUST THE PART -- WE JUST SAY FROM OUR BUDGET.
00:42:37.864: >> WE COULD STRIKE COUNTY HEALTH MILLAGE AND PUT OFFICE OF SUSTAINABILITY IN IT. WE STARTED THE ENGAGEMENT, COUNCILMEMBER LUMM WITH OUR REAL ESTATE FOLKS WITH OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING COLLEAGUES AND WITH OUR AREA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION FOLKS, AS PART OF THE WORK PLAN, LIKE NORMAL PROCESS AND IN THAT, WHAT HAPPENS IS IT BECAME VERY, VERY CLEAR THAT THERE WERE MORE IDEAS THAN WE EVEN THOUGHT OF THAT WERE EMERGING. THAT'S WHY WE REALIZED WE HAD THE CAPACITY. I THOUGHT I WOULD SHARE THAT.
00:43:13.233: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
00:43:14.134: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  I WILL MAKE A MOTION THAT IN THE FINAL WHEREAS CLAUSE, THE OFFICE OF SUSTAINABILITY HAS FUNDING AVAILABLE AND THE ANTICIPATED FISCAL YEAR 2021 BUDGET FOR THEIR 50% SHARE OF THIS POSITION IN THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH MILLAGE THAT WE STRIKE "IN THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH MILLAGE." SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER SMITH. IS THAT FRIENDLY TO THE BODY? FRIENDLY. COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN, YOU STILL HAVE THE FLOOR.
00:43:36.356: >> Councilmember Ackerman: I'M OKAY.
00:43:39.726: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
00:43:41.528: >> Councilmember Grand: WE HEARD FROM COUNCILMEMBER LUMM THAT THIS IS NOT AN EMERGENCY. THERE WERE A BUNCH OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO SHOWED UP A MONTH AGO THAT SAID THIS IS AN EMERGENCY AND WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE FROM THE COMMUNITY WHO ARE ASKING US TO DECLARE A CLIMATE EMERGENCY. CLIMATE EMERGENCY IS PRETTY EMPTY IF YOU DON'T TAKE ACTIONS TO SUPPORT IT. I WOULD RATHER SEE US DOING THIS AND DECLARE -- WE CAN DECLARE A CLIMATE EMERGENCY ALSO, BUT I WOULD RATHER SEE US TAKING SUBSTANTIVE ACTION WHEN I THINK THAT WE WANTED TO  WE WANT TO BE TAKING ACTIONS, OF COURSE, AND LEADING AS A CITY BUT WHEN WE THINK ABOUT WHERE THE GAINS WILL COME FROM, WE ARE SUCH A SMALL PART AS A CITY, AND THIS IS AN ENORMOUS PART OF WHERE OUR ENERGY IS BEING USED. IT SEEMS LIKE A SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY TO GO AFTER THOSE KIND OF SAVINGS IN TERMS OF -- IN TERMS OF CARBON EMISSIONS AND IN TERMS OF ENERGY SAVINGS. SO I REALLY DO SUPPORT THIS EFFORT. IN TERMS OF PROCESS, ALSO IT DOES TAKE EIGHT VOTES TO AMEND THE BUDGET. SO I THINK THAT'S A FAIRLY HIGH THRESHOLD AND THAT'S WHY WE DON'T SEE THESE KINDS OF THINGS COMING FORWARD, BECAUSE IT'S NOT EASY TO GET EIGHT VOTES THROUGH THIS BODY, BUT YOU CERTAINLY HAVE MINE. IT'S AN EXCELLENT PROGRAM AND IF FOR SOME REASON IT DOESN'T GO THROUGH TONIGHT, I LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING IT IN THE BUDGET IN A FEW MONTH, BUT HOPEFULLY WE CAN ACT SOONER BECAUSE IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO WAIT.
00:45:03.310: >> Mayor Taylor: I WILL SUPPORT THIS WHOLEHEARTEDLY, THE -- I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO LIMIT OUR GOOD IDEAS TO DECEMBER, JANUARY, FEBRUARY, MARCH, APRIL, BEFORE THE BUDGET. IF WE HAVE GOOD IDEAS THAT GERMINATE IN THE SPRING AND THE SUMMER, THEN I THINK -- AND WE ARE ABLE TO TAKE ACTION ON THOSE GOOD IDEAS IN THIS TIME FRAME, THEN I THINK IT MAKES A GREAT DEAL OF SENSE FOR US TO ADDRESS THEM BY AMENDING THE BUDGET REASONABLE WHERE WE HAVE THE FUNDS TO DO SO. AND HERE WE PLAINLY DO. IN MY VIEW, THIS FLEXIBILITY, THIS IS NOT A -- THIS IS NOT A BUG. THIS IS A FOOTURE. THIS IS AN -- THIS IS A FEATURE. THIS IS A GOVERNMENT THAT IS THOUGHTFUL AND PROACTIVE AND IT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE DOING AN WE SHOULD BE PROUD OF. CON SILL MEMBER EATON.
00:45:51.091: >> Councilmember Eaton: SO I UNDERSTAND WHERE THE FUNDING IS COMING WITHIN THIS FISCAL YEAR, WHERE WILL THE FUNDING FOR THIS POSITION COME FROM NEXT YEAR?
00:46:02.302: >> WELL, CONSTRUCTION FUND.
00:46:04.204: >> THE AVAILABILITY OF THE CONSTRUCTION FUND IS RECURRING.
00:46:07.440: >> Councilmember Eaton: 50% OF IT.
00:46:10.243: >> AT A MINIMUM. WE CAN SUPPORT FOR THIS FOR YEARS TO COME.
00:46:14.815: >> WE HAVE SUSTAIN ADSAVINGS BECAUSE THE SALARIES ARE LOWER THAN WHEN WE HIRED FOR OUR POSITIONS. WE WILL HAVE A MODEST BUDGET ASK IN THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR BUT IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S LESS THAN $20,000. THE REST IS THROUGH SAVINGS.
00:46:31.131: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
00:46:32.465: >> Councilmember Lumm: AGAIN, I WANT TO REITERATE, THIS IS ALL ABOUT BUDGET DISCIPLINE. AGAIN, WE ARE 3 TO 4 MONTHS INTO THIS FISCAL YEAR. HERE'S A BUDGET AMENDMENT. THIS USED TO BE RARE. TRUST ME, WHEN I SAY THAT. AND NOW IT'S NOT UNUSUAL TO SEE EIGHT VOTE REQUIREMENTS TO AMEND THE BUDGET. I THINK THAT THIS IS POOR PROCESS UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE. AND ESPECIALLY SO IN AN AREA WHERE WE HAVE ALREADY ADDED A HUGE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES. THIS YEAR BETWEEN BUILDING AND RENTAL AND SUSTAINABILITY OFFICES, WE ADDED IN FISCAL YEAR '20 BUDGET, FOUR POSITIONS. IF WE TALK ABOUT ADDING POLICE OFFICERS, YOU KNOW, AGAIN, I -- I REMIND MY COLLEAGUES ABOUT BUDGET DISCIPLINE, AND, YOU KNOW, YOU CAN BASICALLY MAKE A CASE WHERE YOU NAME THE PROGRAM OR THE SERVICE BECAUSE WE HEAR FROM LOTS OF PEOPLE FOR LOTS OF THINGS. IT'S BUDGET DISCIPLINE 101 FOR ME AND IT DOESN'T CUT IT.
00:47:59.386: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER. AND THEN MAY I SUGGEST WE CALL IT A DAY.
00:48:02.956: >> Councilmember Hayner: THESE ARE QUESTIONS. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK AGAIN. BECAUSE WE ARE BUDGETING FOR 2021, IS THIS A TWO-YEAR CO OR ONGOING HIRE?
00:48:15.735: >> WE ANTICIPATE THIS BEING AN ONGOING POSITION?
00:48:18.571: >> Councilmember Hayner:  SO A PERPETUAL POSITION?
00:48:20.240: >> IT WOULD BE.
00:48:21.841: >> Councilmember Hayner:  SO PERHAPS, BRIEFLY, YOU COULD ENLIGHT US, ARE WE GOING TO GET OUR GREEN SHEET OUT OF THIS LIKE WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. FOR THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW, WHEN I TALK ABOUT THE GREEN SHEET, IT'S MY FERVENT WISH THAT THE HOUSING INSPECTORS GIVE THEM A CHECK LIST OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY THINGS TO BE LOOKING FOR. AND I KNOW THEY ALREADY DO. YOU HAVE TO HAVE STOPS IN DRAFTS AND WINDOWS AND SCREENS AND STUFF, BUT WE TALKED ABOUT ADDITIONAL THINGS AND SUGGESTIONS THAT MAY BE MADE AND WE MAY NEED TO DO LEGISLATION AROUND THIS TO SAY THIS TYPE OF ZONING REQUIRES THESE THINGS NOW MOVING FORWARD AND I FULLY ANTICIPATE THAT WE WILL BE DOING THAT. IS THIS THAT KIND OF PERSON?
00:49:02.382: >> YES, THIS PERSON, THERE'S TWO KINDS OF THINGS, IT'S USEFUL, AT LEAST HOW WE CONCEPTUALIZE THIS POSITION. WE HAVE THINGS IN THE WORK PLAN, THE GREEN RENTAL HOUSING IS ONE, AND THAT IS WHEN YOU ARE DOING INSPECTION RIGHT,  YOU UP TO CERTAIN STANDARD AND COSTS? THERE'S WORK WITH OUR REALTORS IN TERM OF SELLING HOMES SO PEOPLE BUYING CAN UNDERSTAND. THOSE ARE THE THINGS WE ALREADY THOUGHT THROUGH, BUT THE THING IS WE NEED TO DO THAT IN PARTNERSHIP, RIGHT, WITH THE UPD US EARS, THE REAL ESTATE COMMUNITY, OR WHOEVER, AND THEY WILL BE CREATING THOSE PROGRAMS AND THEN THERE ARE THE THINGS WE HAVEN'T EVEN THOUGHT OF, RIGHT, THE THINGS THAT EMERGE ORGANICALLY AS AN EXAMPLE, IN SITTING DOWN WITH THE REAL TORES A FEW WEEKS AGO, THEY OFFERED TO HELP US DEVELOP SUSTAINABILITY MESSAGING FOR ANYONE LOOKING TO BUY IN ANN ARBOR. THAT'S A GREAT IDEA BUT WE JUST DIDN'T HAVE THE CAPACITY AT THE MOMENT TO DO THAT. SO THIS PERSON WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR BEING GENERATIVE IN IDEAS THAT WE HAVEN'T EVEN IMAGINED AND COMING BACK TO YOU WITH POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS SHOULD THEY BE NECESSARY. SO, YES AND IS THE ANSWER.
00:50:04.110: >> AND FOR US, I WILL ADD IN FROM THE BUILDING AND RENTAL SIDE OF IT, WHAT WE HAVE ASSURED OUR CUSTOMERS OF, IS THAT WE -- IF WE ARE GOING TO ENACT ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS OR REQUIREMENTS EITHER AS PART OF A RENTAL INSPECTION OR AS PART OF A BUILDING CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY, IS THAT WE WOULD PROVIDE DEDICATED RESOURCES TO HELP THEM THROUGH THAT PROCESS, AND HELP THEM UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT PROCESS IS, BEFORE WE ENACT IT. OUR ROLE, OUR GOAL WITH THIS PERSON, IS A PRIMARY POINT OF CONTACT FOR THESE PEOPLE AS THIS PROGRAM MOVES FORWARD, AND WHEN THEY ENACT ADDITIONAL REGULATION UPON HOW THEY DO THEIR BUSINESS. OUR GOAL WITH THIS PERSON IS IF WE ARE GOING NO MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS PROGRAM AND THE CITY FINDS THIS PROGRAM TO BE IMPORTANT, IS THAT WE CAN GO TO THEM AND TELL THEM WE HAVE PROVIDED A DEDICATED RESOURCE TO HELP THEM GET THROUGH THAT PROCESS. AND SO THAT'S --
00:51:03.069: >> AND CODEVELOP IT.
00:51:04.104: >> YES, THAT'S OUR INTEREST IN IT AND TO DEVELOP IT, CORRECT. PGH >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER
00:51:08.475: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK . I HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT FOR YOU AND THE WORD ON THE STREET IS THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS RUNNING GREAT AND PEOPLE APPRECIATE THE SERVICE THAT YOU ARE PROVIDING. AND NO OFFENSE IF I VOTE AGAINST IT. I'M IN MY 11th MONTH HERE AND SO WE HAVE EASILY HAD 11, EIGHT REQUIREMENTS, EASILY. SO ONE A MONTH, TWO A MONTH. LIKE, COUNCILWOMAN LUMM SAID, WE'RE ALWAYS BEING ASKED TO WAIVE OUR BUDGET. AND I DIDN'T KNOW IF THAT WAS NEW OR NOT, BUT SHE INSISTS IT'S NOT -- OR THAT IT'S A RELATIVELY NEW THING THAT WE ARE DOING HERE. I MEAN, YEAH, THE FREQUENCY OF THAT, AND SO I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. I HAVEN'T REALLY HAD A CHANCE TO LOOK BOOK INTO OLD AGENDAS AND SEE IF THIS IS A TREND TOWARDS THAT BUT I'M MOST INTERESTED IF AND THAT'S SO, THEN I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. I WANTED TO SHARE THAT WITH EVERYBODY. THANK YOU.
00:52:04.564: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILWOMAN GRISWOLD.
00:52:05.798: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I AGREE THIS IS A GREAT IDEA. HOWEVER, IT SEEMS IF IT'S SUCH A GREAT IDEA, WHY CAN'T WE PRIORITIZE IT WITHIN THE EXISTING BUDGET? AND WHAT TROUBLES ME IS WE STILL HAVE CHILDREN CROSSING THE STREET IN CROSSWALKS WITH NO LIGHTING. AND SO AS A COUNCILMEMBER, I NEED TO LOOK AT ALL OF OUR NEEDS. HOW CAN WE PRIORITIZE IT WITHIN THE EXISTING BUDGET? THANKS.
00:52:41.334: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
00:52:42.268: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION AROUND FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY. IT'S SOMETHING NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART AND THAT SOUNDIKE IT'S HANG-UP. I WON'T SPEAK TO THE VALUE OR THE NEED OF MAKING THIS HIRE BUT INSTEAD MAKE AN ARGUMENT FOR THE FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY OF IT. IF WE DON'T USE THIS MONEY, WE'LL CONTINUE TO SIT ON REVENUE THAT WE HAVE EARNED FROM PRIVATE REAL ESTATE DEVELOPERS, WHO WANT TO DO BUSINESS IN THIS CITY, AND IT'S MONEY THAT WE'RE JUST SITTING ON IT FOR HALF THE POSITION. THE OTHER HALF OF THE POSITION IS SAVINGS THAT WE HAVE ALREADY REALIZED. SAVINGS THAT WE REALIZED BECAUSE WE HAVE CIVIL SERVANTS WHO WORK HARD FOR TO MANAGE THEIR BUDGET AND FIND SAVINGS FOR THE TAXPAYERS. SO THIS IS MONEY THAT WE WOULD OTHERWISE BE SITTING ON. HALF OF IT FROM REAL ESTATE DEVELOPERS AND HALF OF IT THROUGH TAXPAYERS WHO WOULDN'T GET A REBATE IF WE DON'T SPEND THIS MONEY. I WOULD RATHER DO SOMETHING TO ACCOMPLISH OUR MISSION OF CREATING HIGH QUALITY OF LIFE NOW AND FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS BY HELPING OUR PRIVATE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY DO WHAT THEY DO, BUT A LITTLE BIT GREENER.
00:54:00.246: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE STARTING WITH COUNCIL WOMAN GRISWOLD. DOG NO.

SPEAKERS HAVE THREE MINUTES IN WHICH TO SPEAK SO PLEASE PLAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE TIME CLOCK. AS A MATTER OF COURTESY, WE MAY ONLY HAVE ONE PERSON SPEAKING AT A TIME AND IF YOU REQUIRE ASSISTANCE IN SPEAKING BEFORE COUNCIL TODAY, WE WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO PROVIDE IT TO YOU.

[CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? THEY ARE APPROVED. ORDINANCES, SECOND READING. AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND SECTIONS 7:400, 7:401, 7:402, 7:403, 7:404, 7:405, AND 7:406 OF CHAPTER 93 (ALARM SYSTEMS) OF TITLE VII OF THE CODE OF THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR.

00:57:32.091: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I'M SORRY. IT WENT WELL THE FIRST TIME THIS CAME TO COUNCIL, I'M HOPING TO GET THE SAME KIND OF SUPPORT AND BRINGING THIS FORWARD AMENDING THE ORDINANCE AND HAVING SOMEBODY FROM THE ANN ARBOR ARTS COMMISSION REPRESENT THE COMMUNITY'S INPUT AND INTEREST WHEN IT COMES TO PUBLIC ART OR POSSIBLE WAYS TO INFLUENCE DESIGN AT THE EARLY STAGES AT THE DESIGN AND REVIEW BOARD. AGAIN, THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE A VOTING MEMBER, BUT SOMEBODY WHO CAN HELP FACILITATE CONVERSATIONS AND MAY SPARK SOMETHING WITH THOSE DISCUSSIONS AT THAT EARLY STAGE, THAT CAN IMPROVE THE AESTHETICS OF BUILDING AND HOPEFULLY PROVIDE SOME PUBLIC ART THAT'S BEING -- THAT WOULD BE DONE BY THE DEVELOPERS, AND NOT THE TAXPAYERS AS WE LOOK TO GET AWAY FROM HAVING TAXPAYERS PAY FOR PUBLIC ART, TRYING TO INFLUENCE PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS AND PRIVATE INSTALLATIONS OF PUBLIC ART, WHICH IS A LOT LESS CONTROVERSIAL AND FAR MORE EXPEDIENT. SO I HOPE TO GET EVERYONE'S SUPPORT HERE. I KNOW COUNCILMEMBER LUMM HERE HAS COSPONSORED IT AND I APPRECIATE THAT. AND AGAIN, JUST LOOKING FOR SOME CROSS SYNERGIES BETWEEN OUR BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS TO STRENGTHEN OUR COMMUNITY.
00:59:02.615: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, LUMM AND THEN GRISWOLD.
00:59:07.286: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES, I WILL SUPPORT THIS BECAUSE WE CERTAINLY NEED SOMETHING TO IMPROVE OUR BUILT ENVIRONMENT. I REALLY BELIEVE THAT STRONGLY AND HOPEFULLY THIS WILL PROVIDE THAT LITTLE SPARK AND NOT ONLY IN KEEPING PUBLIC ART IN MIND BUT IN KEEPING WHEN THEY TAKE A LOOK AT THESE DESIGNS AND TIGHT PLANS FOR THESE BUILDINGS THAT THEY KEEP IN MIND THAT THE PUBLIC ART NEEDS A SPACE AND IT MAY NOT ALWAYS BE A WALL. IT MAY BE SOME SPACE ON THE SITE PLAN THAT WE CAN CREATE AND IT SEEMS LIKE ESPECIALLY IN OUR DOWNTOWN AREA, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE MAP OF ALL THE DOWNTOWN PARKS THAT COUNTS NINE UNIVERSITY PARCELS, IT'S VERY SPARSE. WE HAVE SOME TINY CORNER PARKS AND I THINK IT'S LONG SINCE -- YOU KNOW, SOME WATER GARDENS AND THINGS. I THINK IT'S TIME THAT WE INCORPORATE INTERESTING SPACES AND ENTERING VIEW SHEDS IN OUR URBAN ENVIRONMENT. HOPEFULLY THIS WILL SUPPORT THAT, AND I FULLY SUPPORT THAT.
01:00:07.346: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
01:00:08.948: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI FOR YOUR ADVOCACY AND INITIATING. THIS I KNOW YOU DO GOOD WORK AS THE PUBLIC ART COMMISSION LIAISON AND THIS IS AN ILLUSTRATION OF THAT. AS I NOTED AT THE FIRST READING, I THINK IS GOOD FOR, YOU KNOW, SEVERAL REASONS YOU TOUCHED ON MOST OF THEM, AND OUR -- YOU KNOW, OUR APPROACH TO PUBLIC ART HAS BEEN TO FOCUS EXCLUSIVELY ON THE CITY'S CAPITAL PROJECTS AND I HAVE ALWAYS FELT THAT THAT IS A FLAWED APPROACH AND IT'S JUST TOO NARROW OF A SCOPE. THIS BROADENS THAT SCOPE AND THIS, AGAIN, FOCUSES ON PRIVATELY FUNDED ART WORK AS PART OF DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, NOT TAXPAYER FUNDED PUBLIC ART. AND SO THIS IS, YOU KNOW, YOU SAID THIS SYNERGISTIC, THIS IS THE APPROPRIATE PLACE FOR THE TE DESIGN REVIEW BOARD TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT PUBLIC ART INSTALLATIONS AND IT FITS WELL WITH OTHER DESIGN-RELATED DISCUSSIONS. AGAIN, THANK YOU, AND I HOPE THIS PRODUCES YOU KNOW, SOME -- SOME PRIVATELY FUNDED PUBLIC ART INSTALLATIONS AS PART OF THE THESE VARIOUS DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS THAT WE'LL BE SEEING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YES, FINGERS CROSSED.

01:05:52.725: >> Councilmember Grand: AND I WOULD LIKE TO THANK JERON CRANE WHO IS ON WOODLAWN WHO GOT THE PROCESS STARTED. AT ONE POINT SHE HAD 100% PARTICIPATION. SOME. OTHER DISCUSSIONS IN PARKING WERE IN RESPONSE TO DEVELOPMENT. THIS IS NOT ONE OF THOSE CASES, FROM WHAT THE NEIGHBORS SAY THIS SEEMS TO BE MOSTLY PEOPLE WHO WORK AT THE UNIVERSITY PARKING IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD AND THEY WANT PEOPLE TO PARK THERE BECAUSE THEY CAN'T GET IN. I WAS ABLE TO HAVE I ACONVERSATION WITH ONE OF THE OWNERS ABOUT -- AND JUST GIVE THEM A HEADS UP THAT THIS WAS COMING DOWN SO THAT THEY CAN ALERT THEIR STAFF TO JUST PICK A DIFFERENT SIDE OF THE STREET TO PARK ON.
01:06:44.043: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. DC-3, RESOLUTION TO APPOINT SOPHIE GRILLET TO ANN ARBOR PUBLIC ART COMMISSION. MOVED AND SECONDED. DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR IN. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED WITH 11 COUNCILMEMBERS PRESENT, ALL VOTING IN THE AFFIRMATIVE THUS SATISFYING THE SEVEN VOTE REQUIREMENT. AND DC-4, RESOLUTION TO APPOINT MICAH BARTELME, TO THE DOWNTOWN DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY. MOVED AND SECONDED? DISCUSSION?
01:07:22.915: >> Councilmember Hayner:  THIS IS SEVEN VOTES FOR THE RESIDENCE ADDRESS?
01:07:28.654: >> Mayor Taylor: CORRECT. IS THIS A SPECIAL SPOT THAT THIS PERSON IS TAKING?
01:07:34.726: >> Mayor Taylor: THE GENTLEMAN IS NOT AN ANN ARBOR RESIDENT.
01:07:38.297: >> Councilmember Hayner:  HE JUST LOVES THE DOWNTOWN.
01:07:46.038: >> Councilmember Grand: BUSINESS OWNER. Councilmember Hayner: LIKE, IT'S A REQUIRED APPOINTMENT SEAT.
01:07:51.543: >> Mayor Taylor: I UNDERSTAND.
01:07:52.478: >> Councilmember Grand: WORKS DOWNTOWN.
01:07:54.646: >> Mayor Taylor: I HESITATE TO SAY YES. I DON'T KNOW WHETHER OTHER PEOPLE SATISFY THAT SPOT BY WAY OF EXAMPLE, LIKE THE PERSON WHO WE JUST APPROVED ALSO WORKS IN THE DOWNTOWN, THIS GENTLEMAN, I KNOW, HAS EQUITY INTERESTS IN DOWNTOWN BUSINESSES IF THAT'S RELEVANT. WONDERING WHY IT'S SEVEN VOTES FOR SOMETHING THAT'S NOT DOWNTOWN.
01:08:16.535: >> Mayor Taylor: BECAUSE HE'S NOT AN ANN ARBOR RESIDENT. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
01:08:20.973: >> Councilmember Lumm: SEVEN VOTES BECAUSE HE'S NOT A RESIDENT. HE'S A BUSINESS OWNER AND I THINK THAT'S WHO SHOULD BE ON THE DDA. THIS IS FOR A PARTIAL TERM, AND, YOU KNOW, I THINK THE DDA MEMBERS SHOULD BE FOLKS WITH CONTINUE IN THE GAME, EITHER A BUSINESS OWNER, TAXPAYER OR RESIDENT TAXPAYER. AND HAVE RELEVANT EXPERIENCE AND -- AND HE MEETS BOTH CRITERIA, IN MY VIEW.
01:08:45.531: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
01:08:48.834: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I AGREE. THANK YOU FOR THE EXPLANATION.
01:08:51.303: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: IT'S GOOD TO SEE NEW FACES ON THE DDA. I KNOW MICAH. WE DON'T ALWAYS SEE EYE-TO-EYE ON EVERYTHING, BUT HE DOES LIKE, COUNCILMEMBER LUMM SAID, HAVE SKIN IN THE GAME. HE HAS BUSINESSES, INVESTMENTS IN THE DOWNTOWN AREA. I THINK HE WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE A FRESH PERSPECTIVE ON MATTERS AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING HIM.
01:09:15.561: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, DID I INTERRUPT YOU. MY APOLOGIES.
01:09:21.133: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I THANK COUNCILMEMBER LUMM FOR THE EXPLANATION. I APPRECIATE THAT.
01:09:26.738: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. ALL IN FAVOR. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED BY HE 11 MEMBERS PRESENT AND ALL VOTING IN FIVE, AND THUS SATISFYING THE # VOTE REQUIREMENT. DC-5, RESOLUTION TO PROVIDE DIRECTION TO THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR ON THE PROVISION OF SOLID WASTE SERVICES. MOVED AND SECONDED. COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
01:09:49.361: >> Councilmember Eaton: ON OCTOBER 7th THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR RELEASED A SOLID WASTE ROADMAP, AND THAT ROADMAP DESCRIBED COMBINING ALL OF THE DOWNTOWN -- ALL THE COMMERCIAL AND ALL. MULTIUNIT SOLID WASTE COLLECTION SERVICES INTO ONE BUNDLE TO MAKE IT EASIER TO SUBCONTRACT IT. LAST YEAR, IN MAY, WE PASSED A RESOLUTION ON DIRECTING THE ADMINISTRATOR NOT TO PRIVATIZE SOLID WASTE SERVICES THAT ARE CURRENTLY BEING PROVIDED BY CITY EMPLOYEES. THIS IS JUST TO REPEAT AND AFFIRM THAT POSITION. AND I HOPE THAT I HAVE YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS, BECAUSE WE HAVE DONE THIS BEFORE. THANK YOU.
01:10:38.343: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN?
01:10:40.212: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR AND THANK YOU, MR. EATON FOR BRINGING THE CONVERSATION BACK UP. I WAS GLAD TO SUPPORT THE RESOLUTION BACK IN MAY. BECAUSE MR. LAZARUS AND MR. HUPY AREN'T WITH US AND ARE OUT OF TOWN, WOULD -- I WOULD BE CURIOUS IF COLLEAGUES WOULD BE WILLING TO POSTPONE THIS SO WE CAN USE THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO JUST HAVE A SOLID WASTE DISCUSSION ON THE AGENDA BECAUSE I THINK A LOT OF US HAVE FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS AFTER THAT OCTOBER WORK SESSION THAT WOULD BE -- I DON'T KNOW. THAT NEED A PLATFORM FOR DISCUSSION.
01:11:14.346: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THAT A MOTION?
01:11:15.614: >> Councilmember Ackerman: IT'S A MOTION. WILL THEY BE BACK AT THE NEXT MEETING?
01:11:18.750: >> Mayor Taylor: I ASSUME.
01:11:19.785: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  I WOULD MOVE TO POSTPONE THIS TO THE NEXT MEETING. DISCUSSION POSTPONEMENT. YOU STILL HAVE THE FLOOR.
01:11:31.396: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
01:11:33.098: >> Councilmember Eaton: BECAUSE IT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING NEW, BECAUSE IT DOES WHAT WE DIRECTS THE ADMINISTRATOR TO DO AND AFFIRMS OUR PREVIOUS POSITION, I'M NOT SURE THAT THERE'S MUCH NO DISCUSS, UNLESS EVERYBODY HAS DECIDED THAT WE'RE GOING TO ABANDON THE POSITION THAT WE TOOK LAST MAY. I -- I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE HAVE HAD OUR WORK SESSION ON SOLID WASTE. THIS IS THE ROADMAP THAT HE INTENDS TO FOLLOW. THIS IS NOT THE LAST THING THAT I WILL PICK OUT OF THE ROADMAP TO ADDRESS BY RESOLUTION, BUT CERTAINLY ACCORDING TO HIS CHRONOLOGY IN THAT ROADMAP, THIS IS THE FIRST THING THAT HE INTENDS TO DO. AND SO I -- I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU ARE DESCRIBING, BUT I DON'T THINK THAT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A FURTHER DISCUSSION ABOUT SOLID WASTE. WE HAD THAT WORK SESSION AND THIS IS JUST TO AFFIRM THE DIRECTION THAT WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY GAVE HIM. SO I DON'T SEE ANY REASON TO POSTPONE IS.
01:12:32.391: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI AND THEN ACKERMAN.
01:12:36.027: >> Counc
01:12:37.028: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED BY THIS. IF THIS JUST REAFFIRMS THINGS AND WHAT WE APPROVED LAST STILL STANDS, WHY -- WHY DOES THE VOTE NEED TO OCCUR TONIGHT? I'M JUST -- I SUPPORT UNION LABOR. I SUPPORT THE VALUES THAT PERPETRATED -- THAT BROUGHT THIS RESOLUTION FORTH BUT I'M A LITTLE PERPLEXED AS TO IF IT'S NOT REALLY DOING ANYTHING, IN THE LAST THING WE SAID WAS WHAT THIS SAYS, THEN THAT STILL STANDS.
01:13:14.366: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN. ZA>> Councilmember Ackerman:  I FOR ONE SUBMITTED 12 QUESTIONS AFTER THE WORK SESSION. I GOT ANSWERS TO ALL OF THEM IN WRITING BUT WE HAVEN'T YET HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A FOLLOW-UP CONVERSATION. AND SOMETHING AS CRITICAL AS SOLID WASTE IN OUR NEXT FIVE-YEAR PLAN I THINK NEEDS MORE DELIBERATION AND I WAS EXCITED FOR THIS TO -- AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION. BUT WITHOUT THE APPROPRIATE STAFF, THAT CAN'T HAPPEN.
01:13:45.163: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER SMITH?
01:13:47.466: >> Councilmember Smith: YOU KNOW, FIRST THING IS I WOULD ECHO WHAT MY FIFTH WARD COLLEAGUE SAID IS THERE'S BEEN NOTHING TO -- TO -- NO VOTE TO OVERTURN THE CURRENT COUNCIL POLICY. SO I SEE THIS AS DUPLICATIVE AND UNNECESSARY. I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE HEARD AT THIS TABLE, PARTICULARLY ABOUT JOINING THE SOLID WASTE -- THE REGIONAL SOLID WASTE AUTHORITY WE CAN'T HAVE THE DISCUSSION UNTIL THE SOLID WASTE PLAN IS DONE. WE DON'T HAVE A SOLID WASTE PLAN IN FRONT OF US. WHAT WE HAD IS A REPORT THAT GAVE US SOME INFORMATION, BUT THAT IS NOT THE SOLID WASTE PLAN THAT WILL COME TO US FOR EVENTUAL APPROVAL. THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION WILL BE DISCUSSING THIS IN DEPTH AT THE DECEMBER -- IS IT THE DECEMBER 6th MEETING, I THINK IS WHAT I HAVE BEEN TOLD. I CAN'T REMEMBER IF IT'S THE DECEMBER 6th OR THE NOVEMBER MEETING. BUT IT WAS -- WE WILL BE HAVING ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION ON IT THEN, BEFORE ANY RECOMMENDATION WOULD COME BACK TO COUNCIL. SO I WOULD THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, IT WOULD BE PREMATURE TO HAVE THIS DISCUSSION ABSENT THE RELEVANT STAFF HERE TO DISCUSS IT.
01:15:08.580: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
01:15:10.382: >> Councilmember Lumm: IS THE MOVE TO POSTPONE ON THE TABLE?
01:15:12.884: >> Mayor Taylor: IT IS.
01:15:13.451: >> Councilmember Lumm: TO THE POSTPONEMENT, I WOULD JUST SAY IN DEFENSE OF NOT POSTPONING -- AND I SUBMITTED LIKE 30 PLUS QUESTIONS AFTER THE WORK SESSION, AND GOT A RESPONSE LAST WEEK. AND SO THERE'S STILL A LOT OF, YEAH, ISSUES TO DISCUSS, OBVIOUSLY. AND I DO APPRECIATE THE RESPONSES RECEIVED. WHEN WE LAST VOTED ON THIS WAS MAY 21st, THIS IS TO THE POSTPONEMENT. AND IT WAS PASSED ON A 7-4 VOTE. I DID NOT VOTE FOR IT ALONG WITH THE MAYOR, THE FORMER COUNCILMEMBER WESTPHAL AND COUNCILMEMBER SMITH. SO WE HAVE A NEW GROUP NOW. SO I THINK THAT'S A REASON WHY IT'S NOT JUST GOING OVER THE SAME OLD GROUND WITH OBVIOUSLY NOT THE SAME PEOPLE. YOU KNOW WHO VOTED. YOU KNOW AMONGST YOURSELVES WHO VOTED FOR THIS, BUT THERE'S ONE, TWO, THREE COUNCILMEMBERS WHO SUPPORTED PREVIOUSLY, WHO ARE NO LONGER HERE. SO I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO WEIGH IN ON THIS.
01:16:28.226: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
01:16:29.394: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI THIS DOES SEEM -- AND I GOOD HE WITH COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN THAT -- AND I AGREE WITH COUNCIL ACKERMAN, THAT IF WE ARE GOING TO GIVE THIS TYPE. DIRECTION WITHOUT A COMPLETE PLAN, THE RELEVANT STAFF SHOULD BE HERE. WE TALKED ABOUT EXISTING COUNCIL POLICY, BUT THIS IS NOT PRESENTED AS NEW COUNCIL POLICY. THIS IS AN AFFIRMATION OF EXISTING COUNCIL POLICY. SO TO ME, THIS ISN'T REALLY THE SAME LEVEL OF URGENCY THERE, AND -- AND I THINK WE -- IF WE WANT TO HAVE A NEW POLICY, THEN BRING FORWARD A NEW POLICY BUT I DON'T WANT TO HAVE A NEW POLICY. I WAS ONE OF THOSE COUNCILMEMBERS THAT VERY PROUDLY VOTED ON MAY 21st, 2018 TO SUPPORT THIS POLICY. I THINK IT'S REALLY STRAIGHTFORWARD THAT WE USE UNION LABOR FOR SOLID WASTE, THAT WE'RE CERTAINLY NOT LOOKING TO REDUCE OUR UNION WORKFORCE IN THIS AREA. I ANTICIPATE THAT IF ANYTHING, THAT IT WILL STAY THE SAME OR IT WILL BE INCREASED AS THE NEW PLAN GOES FORWARD, BUT I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM STAFF AND I'M VERY SUPPORTIVE OF A SHORT POSTPONEMENT SO THAT WE CAN HAVE OUR EXPERTS AT THE TABLE.
01:17:50.375: >> Mayor Taylor: IT'S BEEN REPRESENTED THAT THIS -- THAT ALL THIS RESOLUTION DOES IS RATIFY -- RATIFY THE EXISTING -- EXISTING RESOLUTION. IS THERE SOLID WASTE STAFF IN THE HOUSE WHO CAN LET US KNOW WHETHER THAT'S ACCURATE OR NOT?
01:18:09.627: >> MR. HUPY IS NOT HERE -- WAS NOT ABLE TO ATTEND TONIGHT. SO THERE'S NOT STAFF HERE.
01:18:14.432: >> Mayor Taylor: SO IT'S BEEN REPRESENTED THAT IT'S A RATIFICATION BUT WE CAN'T HAVE THAT CONFIRMED BY STAFF. IN MY VIEW, THAT SPEAKS TO IT BEING APPROPRIATE FOR A POSTPONEMENT. YOU KNOW, WE HAVE -- AS COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI SAYS, THE RESOLUTIONS FROM THE -- FROM BACK IN 2018 STANDS. THAT'S THE RULES. MR. LAZARUS, IF NOTHING ELSE FOLLOWS THE RULES IN MY VIEW, IT'S THE ONGOING POLICY, AND THAT'S GOING TO BE THE ORDER OF THE DAY, UNTIL COUNCIL CHANGES ITS MIND. AND -- BUT I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT'S IN HERE AND HOW THIS COINCIDES WITH -- WITH THE EXISTING POLICY. AND SO I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THE POSTPONEMENT SO THAT WE CAN FIND
01:19:00.011: >> Councilmember Eaton: MR. MAYO R.
01:19:02.847: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
01:19:04.716: >> Councilmember Eaton: SO I BELIEVE WE GAVE THE ADMINISTRATOR CLEAR DIRECTION ON MAY 21st. WE HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING TO CHANGE THAT DIRECTION. SO I BELIEVE IT REMAINS IN EFFECT. BUT HIS OCTOBER 7th ROADMAP ON SOLID WASTE CLEARLY ANNOUNCES THE INTENTION TO SUBCONTRACT WORK THAT'S CURRENTLY BEING PERFORMED BY CITY EMPLOYEES. IT'S NUMBER FOUR ON THE SECOND PAGE, AND IN RESPONSE TO AN AGENDA QUESTION, WHERE I ASKED WHETHER THIS DOESN'T CONFLICT WITH THE MAY 21st, 2018 DIRECTION THAT WE GAVE HIM, HE SEEMS TO BELIEVE THAT IT DOESN'T. AND SO I -- I THINK THAT IT IS APPROPRIATE FOR US TO AFFIRM THAT DIRECTION AS STILL BEING IN FORCE AND SUSCEPTIBLE TO BEING OBEYED.
01:19:59.737: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE POSTPONEMENT. ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
01:20:07.712: >> Councilmember Griswold: NO.
01:20:12.183: >> Councilmember Lumm: NO.
01:20:12.750: >> Councilmember Grand: YES.
01:20:13.351: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES.
01:20:16.754: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
01:20:17.455: >> Councilmember Eaton: NO.
01:20:18.056: >> Councilmember Nelson:  NO.
01:20:20.592: >> Councilmember Smith: YES.
01:20:21.192: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES.
01:20:22.694: >> Councilmember Hayner:  NO.
01:20:24.395: >> Councilmember Bannister: NO.
01:20:26.831: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION FAILS.
01:20:34.138: >> City Atty. Postema: EXCUSE ME, MAYOR, CAN WE TAKE A SHORT BREAK?
01:20:37.308: >> Councilmember Lumm: CAN WE VOTE ON THIS FIRST?
01:20:39.143: >> City Atty. Postema: I BROUGHT -- ATTORNEY ELIAS IS DOWN HERE. I WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO COUNCILMEMBER EATON BRIEFLY ON A MATTER RELATING TO IT. THAT MIGHT BE RELEVANT. BEFORE YOU TAKE A VOTE ON IT.
01:20:53.491: >> Mayor Taylor: LET'S TAKE A SHORT BREAK. [ BREAK ]
01:24:34.578: >> Mayor Taylor: WE ARE BACK AFTER A SHORT BREAK. MR. EATON. COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
01:24:45.623: >> Councilmember Eaton: UPON THE ADVICE OF COUNCIL I WOULD LIKE TO STRIKE THE LAST RESOLVE CLOSE ON THE RESOLUTION.
01:24:52.864: >> Mayor Taylor: SECONDED BY BANNISTER. IS THAT FRIENDLY TO THE BODY? THE AMENDMENT IS FRIENDLY. FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN MOTION AS AMENDED? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
01:25:05.409: >> Councilmember Hayner:  JUST BRIEFLY -- I THANK YOU, MAYOR. I WASN'T ONE OF THOSE FOLKS WHO SUPPORTED THIS NOTION IN MAY AND I RECOGNIZE WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING, THAT UNTIL IT'S RESCINDED IT STILL STANDS AND WE HAVE SEEN EXAMPLES OF THAT AND WE WERE SPEAKING TO SOME PRIVATELY. I WOULD BE HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS, AND I WOULD HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT IN MAY, AND I THINK STRIKING THAT DOES HELP. IT HELPS TO CLARIFY WHAT'S GOING ON HERE A LITTLE BIT. I STILL WOULD -- I KIND OF HAVE TO AGREE, I WOULD PREFER SOMETHING THAT IS, YOU KNOW, EXHIBITING CHANGE BUT I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS AS I WOULD HAVE, HAD I BEEN IN MAY. THANK YOU.
01:25:43.314: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? SO I GUESS, YOU KNOW, SINCE -- WELL, AS I SAID FROM THE JUMP, I DON'T KNOW -- NOT HAVING HEARD FROM STAFF AS TO THE CONGRUENCE BETWEEN NOW THE FIRST TWO RESOLVE CLAUSES AND THE ACTUAL RESOLUTION IN MAY, I GUESS -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IN THESE CLAUSES AND HOW THAT RELATES TO THE MAY RESOLUTION AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT CHANGES THOSE TWO RESOLVE CLAUSES WOULD AFFECT. AND SO I GUESS I WOULD ASK IF SOMEONE WOULD CONSIDER OFFERING AN AMENDMENT ESSENTIALLY STRIKING THE TWO RESOLVE CLAUSES AND SAYING RESOLVE THAT THE CITY COUNCIL RATIFIES AND APPROVES THE RESOLUTION R-18-19 # TO ENSURE THAT WHAT WE ARE, IN FACT, DOING, IS WHAT WE SAID WE ARE DOING AND THAT IS RATIFYING THE EXISTING POLICY. SECONDED BY? RATHER IS THERE SOMEONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO DO THAT OR IF NOT, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
01:26:57.088: >> Councilmember Eaton: I WANTED TO SPEAK AND HE NEEDS SOMEONE TO MOVE AND SECOND.
01:27:01.826: >> Mayor Taylor: MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, AND SECONDED BY GRISWOLD. THAT IS TO SAY RESOLUTION -- OFFERING AN AMENDMENT DELETING FIRST TWO RESOLVE CLAUSES AND SAYING, WITH -- RESERVING -- REINSERTING RESOLVE THE CITY COUNCIL RATIFIES RESOLUTION R-18-194. DISCUSSION OF THE AMENDMENT? COUNCILMEMBER EATON?
01:27:26.984: >> Councilmember Eaton: WITH REGARD TO THE AMENDMENT, IN HIS RESPONSE TO THE AGENDA QUESTIONS, HE MAKES CLEAR THAT HE DOESN'T CONSIDER THE MAY 2018 RESOLUTION TO BE A LIMIT ON HIS ABILITY TO SUBCONTRACT DOWNTOWN WORK THAT'S BEING PERFORMED BY CITY EMPLOYEES. INSTEAD, HE ASSERTS THAT IF WE MOVE THOSE SAME EMPLOYEES TO OTHER VALID SOLID WASTE SERVICET IT'S CONSISTENT WITH THAT PRIOR RESOLUTION. I WROTE THAT PRIOR RESOLUTION. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT IT SAYS. SO I WOULD LIKE TO CLARIFY WITH THESE TWO RESOLVE CLAUSES THAT THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE MEANT IN MAY OF 2018 AND WE STILL MEAN IT. THERE'S A DISTINCTION BETWEEN ELIMINATING JOBS AND ELIMINATING WORK. HE'S PRESERVING A NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES BUT HE IS -- HE HAS EXPRESSED THROUGH HIS OCTOBER 7th -- OR OCTOBER THE 9th ROADMAP THAT HE INTENDS TO CONTRACT OUT THE WORK AND THOSE -- IN LABOR RELATIONS THOSE ARE TWO DISTINCT AREAS AND SO THIS RESOLUTION IS MEANT TO RESTATE AND AFFIRM WHAT WE PREVIOUSLY SAID BUT IN A MANNER SO THAT HE DOESN'T FURTHER ARGUE WITH THE INTENT OF THAT RESOLUTION. SO I HOPE THAT YOU WILL VOTE AGAINST REMOVING THOSE TWO RESOLVE CLAUSES. AND REMOVE ANY ARGUMENT THAT MAY -- MAY PERSIST IN HIS MIND ABOUT WHAT PREVIOUS RESOLUTION MEANT.
01:29:11.255: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
01:29:12.123: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I'M JUST NOT COMFORTABLE RIGHT NOW VOTING ON THIS WITHOUT STAFF HERE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. I MEAN, THIS JUST -- IT'S ASKING FOR THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR TO CEASE ALL ACTIONS -- I MEAN, STOP WHAT YOU ARE DOING. DON'T GIVE US ANY OPTIONS. DON'T LET COUNCIL AS A BODY LOOK AT EVERYTHING AND MAKE A DECISION. AND IT LIMITS OUR CHOICES, PERHAPS SOME MAY SUPPORT IT, SOME MAY NOT, BUT THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR WORKS FOR THE ENTIRE CITY. AND I THINK, YOU KNOW, THAT TO ME IS JUST -- IT JUST -- IT'S HANDCUFFING SOMEBODY THAT IS SET OUT TO DO A JOB. AND I -- I JUST DON'T LIKE IT AS MUCH AS I STAND BY, YOU KNOW, THE VALUES OF UNION AND UNION LABOR, I ALSO KNOW THAT OUR SOLID WASTE IN DOWNTOWN AND OTHER PARTS HASN'T BEEN AT ITS BEST PERFORMANCE AND WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF A MAJOR REOVERHAUL. AND WE DON'T HAVE STAFF HERE TO RESPOND TO QUESTIONS OR TELL US WHAT'S DIFFERENT BETWEEN THIS ONE AND THE ONE THAT WAS PASSED IN 2018, AND IT'S JUST -- I DON'T UNDERSTAND. IT WAS SOMETHING THAT MEANS THIS MUCH, CAN'T BE POSTPONED UNTIL STAFF IS HERE TO RESPOND TO SOME OF THE QUESTIONS. UNFORTUNATELY, MY COLLEAGUES PUT ME IN A BAD POSITION HERE. I CANNOT -- I CANNOT SUPPORT THIS IN THE CURRENT SITUATION.
01:30:50.955: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND AND THEN HAYNER.
01:30:53.624: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU.
01:30:54.558: >> Mayor Taylor: ON THE AMENDMENT.
01:30:55.926: >> Councilmember Grand: YES. SO I WOULD LIKE TO SUPPORT THE AMENDMENT AND I KNOW IT'S SPEAKING TO THE RESOLUTION, BUT I THINK IT, YOU KNOW, SPEAKS TO ONE BEING VERY CLEAR AND ONE BEING NOT SO CLEAR. YOU KNOW, WHEN I ARE A ED PART OF THE FIRST RESOLVE CLAUSE, ANY PART OF WHICH ARE CURRENTLY PERFORMED BY CITY STAFF, THERE'S A LOT OF ROOM FOR AMBIGUITY IN THAT STATEMENT THERE. COULD BE SOMEONE FROM CITY STAFF WHO COMES DOWN TO THE MAYOR'S GREEN FAIR AND DOES RECYCLING EDUCATION. THAT COULD BE RELATED TO SOLID WASTE. SHOULD THAT PERSON HAVE TO BE UNIONIZED? I DON'T KNOW. I UNDERSTAND THAT'S NOT THE INTENT AND THIS IS WHY I VOTED FOR POSTPONEMENT BECAUSE I THINK WE NEED SOME CITY STAFF HERE TO HELP US CLARIFY WHERE WE ARE AND IN MAY 2018, I VOTED TO SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION BECAUSE -- BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH WE HAD OPTIONS IN FRONT OF US, IT WAS PRETTY CLEAR WHAT THOSE OPTIONS WERE GOING TO BE CLEAR AND IT WAS PRETTY CLEAR THAT WE WEREN'T -- OR AT LEAST THE MAJORITY OF COUNCIL WAS NOT GOING TO GO WITH ONE OF THOSE OPTIONS BECAUSE IT WAS GOING TO PRIVATIZE, AND THAT WENT AGAINST OUR VALUES. THIS, TO ME, IS A LOT MORE WE SWISHY-WASHY. I THINK WHAT WE HAVE NOW PROTECTS THE STAFF THAT WE HAVE. IT COULD POSSIBLY EVEN GIVE THEM SOME POTENTIAL TO GROW WITHIN THEIR POSITIONS. IT DOESN'T LIMIT AS MUCH OF WHAT THEY DO. BECAUSE I -- I THINK WE HAVE GOTTEN STRONGER AS A CITY WHEN WE HAVE ALLOWED WORKERS, FOR EXAMPLE, TO ALLOW -- YOU KNOW, THEY CAN F PLOW SNOW IN THE WINR OR CUT GRASS IN THE SUMMER. WE SAY THAT WE BELIEVE THAT OUR UNIONIZED CITY WORKERS SHOULD BE UNIONIZED BUT I'M IN THE SURE WHAT VALUE ADDED WE HAVE HERE. I WOULD RATHER KNOW WHAT OUR -- WHAT OUR OPTIONS ARE AND THEN WITH THE SENSE THAT WE HAVE, SAY, YOU KNOW, HOW CAN WE ENSURE THAT WE USE OUR CITY STAFF TO OUR GREATEST CAPACITY, OUR UNIONIZED STAFF AND THEN, YOU KNOW, WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE TO USE UNIONIZED STAFF FOR THESE -- FOR THESE OTHER JOBS AND HOW CAN WE MAXIMIZE THAT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE? BUT I'M JUST -- I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHY THIS IS COMING HERE TO US NOW AND WHY WE, YOU KNOW CAN'T WAIT A COUPLE OF WEEKS.
01:33:30.047: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
01:33:30.948: >> Councilmember Hayner:  TO SPEAK TO THE SHUFFLING OF THE RESOLVE CLAUSES, THE RESOLVE CLAUSE THAT MEANS THE MOST TO ME IS THE SECOND ONE WHICH MEANS CITY COUNCIL AFFIRMS ITS OPPOSITION TO THE PRIVATIZATION OF SOLID WASTE SERVICES NOT CURRENTLY PERFORMED BY AN OUTSIDE CONTRACTOR. AND THAT'S THE IMPORTANT PART. I WOULD GET RID OF THE SECOND ONE AND GET RID OF THE FIRST AND THE THIRD ONE. I'M NOT SURE THAT THAT'S WHERE WE ARE AT. WHAT IS THE MOTION? TO DELETE FIRST TWO AND LEAVE THE THIRD? FOR ME --
01:33:58.108: >> Mayor Taylor: THE THIRD IS ALREADY GONE.
01:33:59.777: >> Councilmember Hayner:  SO WE ARE TALKING ABOUT LOSING THE FIRST TWO?
01:34:03.714: >> Councilmember Lumm: IT RATIFIES THE MAY --
01:34:05.949: >> Mayor Taylor: THE PROPOSAL WAS TO DELETE THE FIRST TWO RESOLVE CLAUSES AND TO SUBSTITUTE THEM WITH THE RATIFICATION, BUT --
01:34:17.695: >> Councilmember Hayner:  THE THIRD? I MEAN, THE ONE THAT MEANS MOST TO ME IS THE SECOND ONE. SO I GUESS THAT MEANS I'M NOT SUPPORTING THIS BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO AMEND AN AMENDMENT. I DON'T WANT TO GO DOWN THAT HOLE.
01:34:30.174: >> Mayor Taylor: AMENDING AN AMENDMENT IS PERFECTLY PROPER PROCEDURE.
01:34:35.079: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WOULD SAY LEAVE THE SECOND RESOLVE CLAUSE AND IT ACTUALLY ACTS AS A RATIFICATION IN MY MIND.
01:34:41.185: >> Mayor Taylor: WHAT I HEAR YOU SAYING, WOULD YOU OFFER AN AMENDMENT TO THE AMENDMENT, THAT IS TO SAY TO PROVIDE THAT THE AMENDMENT NOW ONLY RELATES TO THE FIRST RESOLVE CLAUSE, SAVING THE SECOND?
01:34:55.032: >> Councilmember Grand: I HEAR FROM THOSE THAT PUT IT FORWARD THAT THAT'S FRIENDLY?
01:34:58.435: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I'M NOT SURE THAT'S WHAT I MEANT. I WOULD LOSE THE FIRST ONE, KEEP THE SECOND ONE AND THEN I WOULD -- YOU KNOW, THAT'S FINE BUT IT SEEMS LIKE THE SECOND ONE ACTS AS OUR AFFIRMATION ON ITS OWN, BUT THAT'S JUST -- THAT'S -- THAT'S MY TAKE ON IT, AND TO BE FRANK, AFTER THIS CONVERSATION, I'M CONSIDERING MOVING FOR POSTPONEMENT AGAIN AND I WISH THAT I HAD VOLTED THE OTHER WAY. -- VOTED THE OTHER WAY ON THAT MATTER.
01:35:25.729: >> Councilmember Eaton: YOU CAN MOVE FOR RECONSIDERATION.
01:35:29.099: >> Councilmember Hayner: WHAT'S THAT.
01:35:29.933: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WOULD MOVE FOR RECONSIDERATION.
01:35:33.403: >> Mayor Taylor: OF THE POSTPONEMENT. IS THERE  A SECOND.
01:35:45.616: >> Clerk Beaudry: HAYNER.
01:35:46.216: >> Mayor Taylor: PROCEDURALLY WE ARE ON THE AMENDMENT.
01:35:49.520: >> Councilmember Hayner: THAT'S WHY I'M SORRY TO GO DOWN THAT.
01:35:52.823: >> Mayor Taylor: FOR MY PART, I THINK POSTPONEMENT IS PROBABLY -- IS WHAT I PREFER. MAY I ASK THAT THE AMENDMENT BE WITHDRAWN AND THEN WE ROLL WITH RECONSIDERATION ON THE POSTPONEMENT AND THEN WE'LL TAKE IT FROM THERE?
01:36:04.334: >> Councilmember Hayner: OTHERWISE I WOULD TRY TO RECRAFT IT AND I GOT OUT OF SYNC AS TO WHERE WE ARE AS TO LEAVE THE SECOND RESOLVE CLAUSE ONLY AND GET RID OF THIS.
01:36:13.310: >> Mayor Taylor: GET RID OF NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO. PARDON ME --
01:36:16.780: >> Councilmember Hayner:  GET RID OF ONE AND THREE AND THE AFFIRMATIVE STATEMENT BECAUSE I BELIEVE TWO ACTS AS  THE AFFIRMATION. THAT'S WHERE I WOULD LIKE IT TOO BE BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT IT'S A PROPER MOTION, NOR HAS IT A --
01:36:35.766: >> Councilmember Grand: IT'S FRIENDLY.
01:36:38.302: >> Councilmember Eaton: I THINK SOMEONE HAS TO WITHDRAW THE PROPOSED AMENDMENT THAT IS CURRENTLY BEING CONSIDERED IN ORDER TO ALLOW HIM TO MAKE HIS MOTION TO RECONSIDER.
01:36:47.411: >> Mayor Taylor: YES, BUT --
01:36:49.546: >> Councilmember Eaton: WHICH WOULD NOT PREVENT THEM FROM BRINGING BACK THE AMENDMENT.
01:36:52.616: >> Mayor Taylor: EXACTLY. LET'S DO THAT. SO I FORGET WHO MOVED AND SECONDED. IS LUMM --
01:37:00.324: >> Mayor Taylor: LUMM AND GRISWOLD. IS IT OKAY IF WE PULL THAT BACK? THE AMENDMENT IS WITHDRAWN FOR THE TIME BEING. MOTION TO RECONSIDER WITH RESPECT TO POSTPONEMENT?
01:37:08.732: >> Councilmember Hayner:  WITH YOUR PERMISSION.
01:37:11.668: >> Mayor Taylor: I'M HERE TO SERVE. IS THERE A SECOND ON THE RECONSIDERATION? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI. CAN WE HAVE A ROLL CALL VOTE ON THE RECONSIDERATION?
01:37:20.844: >> Councilmember Eaton: IF IT HELPS, I WON'T OPPOSE IT THIS TIME AND I THINK W COULD DO IT BY ACCLIMB.
01:37:28.085: >> Mayor Taylor: IF WE CAN DO IT BY ACCLAIM, WE CAN DO IT BY ACCLAIM. ALL IN FAVOR OF RECONSIDERATION? SORRY, I NEED TWO PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE.
01:37:39.930: >> Councilmember Eaton: NEVER MIND THEN.
01:37:41.431: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THAT TRUE.
01:37:43.867: >> Councilmember Eaton: GO AHEAD WITH THE ROLL CALL.
01:37:46.870: >> Mayor Taylor: ROLL CALL STARTING WITH -- WITH THE RECONSIDERATION OF THE POSTPONEMENT.
01:37:53.210: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: ALLOWING IT TO COME BACK.
01:37:56.546: >> Councilmember Nelson:  IS THERE A SECOND? TO RECONSIDER?
01:38:02.819: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI. WE NEED A SECOND ALSO? I'M WELCOME TOLD ME NEED A SECOND WHO VOTED AGAINST THE POSTPONEMENT.
01:38:13.263: >> Councilmember Eaton: I WOULD SECOND IT.
01:38:14.531: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU, COUNCIL MEMBER EATON. ROLL CALL CALL VOTE WITH GRISWO.
01:38:25.842: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES.
01:38:28.011: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES.
01:38:28.612: >> Councilmember Grand: YES.
01:38:29.212: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES.
01:38:31.715: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.

01:38:32.816: >> Councilmember Nelson:  YES.
01:38:34.985: >> Councilmember Smith: YES.
01:38:35.585: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: ABSOLUTELY.
01:38:37.120: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES.
01:38:38.221: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES.
01:38:39.790: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION CARRIES.
01:38:41.558: >> Mayor Taylor: THE MOTION FOR POSTPONEMENT IS UP NOW FOR RECONSIDERATION. SO IT IS ON THE FLOOR WITH THE PRIOR MOVERS AND SECONDERS. IS THERE FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MOST TO POSTPONE? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER AND THEN GRISWOLD.
01:38:56.173: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU FOR YOUR INDULGENCE. I THINK AFTER THAT CONTINUING CONVERSATION, IT MADE ME RETHINK MY CONSIDERATION OF POSTPONEMENT. SO I APPRECIATE YOU ALLOWING ME TO BRING IT BACK FOR ANOTHER VOTE.
01:39:10.487: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD?
01:39:11.388: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I THINK WE ARE A POLICY MAKING GROUP WITH A LOT OF PRIORITIES AND THIS DISCUSSION TONIGHT SEEMS CRAZY. I DON'T KNOW HOW ELSE TO PUT IT. IT SEEMS LIKE WE HAVE A RESOLUTION BECAUSE IT'S PERCEIVED THAT THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR IS NOT FOLLOWING A PREVIOUS RESOLUTION THAT WE PASSED AND NOW WE ARE TALKING ABOUT POSTPONING SOMERESOLUTION. AND IF ANYONE IN THE AUDIENCE KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE DOING, YOU KNOW, GRAPH IT! GREAT! BUT I JUST THINK THAT THIS IS ALL EXTREMELY DIFFICULT AND REFLECTS POORLY ON US AS A GOVERNING BODY.
01:39:54.398: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE POSTPONEMENT? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
01:39:58.135: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I THINK THIS MAY SOUND A LITTLE COARSE AROUND THE EDGES. I'M ASKING FOR THIS POSTPONEMENT BECAUSE IT FIXES WITH MY LONGSTANDING POLICY, THAT I WON'T SAY SOMETHING BEHIND SOMEONE'S BACK THAT I WOULDN'T SAY TO THEIR FACE. IF WE THINK THAT THE CITY MANAGER IS IGNORING STUFF. WE SHOULD TALK TO HIM PUBLICKY THERE. IT SITS WITH ME MORALLY TO POSTPONE IT.
01:40:31.068: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I JUST APPRECIATE THAT EXTRA 15, 20 MINUTES GAVE US THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME TO THE CONCLUSION OF GOOD GOVERNMENT AND, YOU KNOW, AND ALLOWING FOR A FULL DISCUSSION. THANK YOU.
01:40:49.286: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
01:40:50.287: >> Councilmember Lumm: I WILL SUPPORT THE POSTPONEMENT. BUT IN GENERAL, I -- YOU KNOW, WHEN A SIMILAR RESOLUTION CAME TO COUNCIL MAY OF LAST YEAR, I DIDN'T SUPPORT IT BECAUSE I BELIEVED IT UNNECESSARILY LIMITED THE CITY'S FLEXIBILITY AND CLOSED THE DOOR ON OPTIONS TO IMPROVE SOLID WASTE EFFICIENCIES -- SYSTEM EFFICIENCIES THAT WE SHOULD CONSIDER. I WILL SUPPORT POSTPONEMENT, BUT I THINK -- AND IN THE ROADMAP FOR SOLID WASTE RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PLAN, AND WE HAVE SEEN IT, THERE'S BEEN SOME PUSHBACK ON A SAVINGS SYSTEM AND STAFF HAS CONFIDENCE IN THE ANALYSIS TO USE THEIR WORDS AND THE PLAN IS TO COMPETITIVELY PROCURE THE BUSINESS AND WE'LL SEE THIS -- THE COMPLETION IS EXPECTED BY NOVEMBER, IF I UNDERSTAND, AND I JUST THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, IN GENERAL COMPETITIVE BIDDING ISLWAYS A SOUND FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE APPROACH TO TAKE, AND -- AND IN THE PAST, I PROPOSED RESOLUTIONS FOR COMPETITIVE BIDDING FOR SOLID WASTE. SO, AGAIN, NOT -- I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM POSTPONING THIS, BUT I THINK YOU CAN SENSE WHERE I WILL BE COMING FROM WHEN THIS IS -- WHEN WE REVISIT THIS. SO THANKS.
01:42:14.538: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE POSTPONEMENT. ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT IS POSTS PONED. DC-6, RESOLUTION TO APPROVE FEES FOR MEDICAL MARIJUANA FACILITIES/ADULT USE MARIJUANA ESTABLISHMENT PERMITS. MOVED BY RAMLAWI AND SECONDED BY SMITH. DISCUSSION OF DC-6. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:42:34.724: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. I SPONSORED THE ORDINANCE, ALLOWING RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA TO TAKE EFFECT NOVEMB NOVEMBER 1st AND THIS IS JUST PROTOCOL AND ALLOWING THAT TO FOLLOW THROUGH, THE FEES THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE PERMITTING PROCESS WILL GO BACK INTO ADMINISTERING THE PROGRAM. I HOPE THAT FUTURE FEES THAT WE COLLECT GIVE THE LATHTUDE TO MONEY IN THE SOCIAL PROGRAMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SOCIAL ILLS AND THE SOCIAL INJUSTICE THAT COME ALONG IN EVERYBODY'S LIFE. EVERYBODY KNOWS SOMEBODY THAT HAS SOME ISSUES THAT COULD BE -- COULD BE HELPED WITH AND PROVIDE THE REVENUE COMING FROM THIS NEW INDUSTRY SHOULD COME BACK INTO HELPING PEOPLE WHO NEED THE HELP THE MOST. SO UNFORTUNATELY, WE WERE NOT ABLE TO PROCURE MONEY. WITH THIS STEP, HOPEFULLY IN THE FUTURE, WE SHOULD. IT SEEMS TO BE PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD TYPE OF LEGISLATION.
01:43:46.596: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
01:43:48.331: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU. I KNOW THIS IS JUST THE FIRST READING ON THIS AND WE MAY HAVE SOME PEOPLE SHOW UP AT THE NEXT PUBLIC HEARING, AT SECOND READING. I MEAN, THERE WILL BE A SECOND PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULED, CORRECT? NO?
01:44:00.977: >> Mayor Taylor: IT'S A STRAIGHT UP RESOLUTION.
01:44:02.479: >> Councilmember Hayner:  IT'S A STRAIGHT UP RESOLUTION FOR FEES. LET ME SAY THAT THERE'S SOME EQUITY ISSUES WITH THESE FEES. ANNUAL PERMIT APPLICATION. SO THAT'S LIKE A FIRST PERMIT. $5,000. I KNOW THAT'S PERMITTED ALLOWED BY THE STATE. ADDITIONAL PERMIT TYPE $5,000. I UNDERSTAND AGAIN IT'S ALLOWED BY THE STATE AND SO WOULD BE THE RENEWAL OF AN ANNUAL PERMIT AT $58,000. THAT SEEMS LIKE -- AT $5,000. THAT SEEMS LOOK A BARRIER ENTRY, $5,000 TO ASK FOR A PERMIT AND 5 GRAND TO RENEW IT. AND WHEN WE SET THE LIQUOR LICENSE FEES, WE ARE GETTING READY TO RAISE THEM UP. THERE'S INCREASED STAFF TIMES AND INCREASED WAGES AND SO ON, TO DEAL WITH THE LIQUOR LICENSES. I WOULD ASSUME THE SAME FOR THIS BUT I THINK A LIQUOR LICENSE RENEWAL IS GOING UP. AND THIS IS $5,000. DOES THIS NOT HAVE TO BE COMMENSURATE WITH THE SERVICE PROVIDED. MAYBE THAT'S A QUESTION -- SORRY TO SPRING THAT ONE, MR. CRAWFORD. IS THAT A QUESTION FOR THE ACCOUNTING ADMINISTRATOR OR ATTORNEY? I THOUGHT THAT OUR FEES HAD TO BE COMMENSURATE WITH SERVICES PROVIDED.
01:45:07.877: >> City Atty. Postema: I THINK WITH THE ANALYSIS THAT THIS HAS BEEN A DETERMINATION THAT THAT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE. THAT'S MY UNDERSTAND.
01:45:23.626: >> Councilmember Hayner: BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH MORE WITH THE FEE.
01:45:28.398: >> I BELIEVE WHEN THE STATE LAW ALLOWED FOR THE PERMITS TO BE AT THIS LEVEL, IT WASN'T AT A COST BASIS.
01:45:35.505: >> Councilmember Hayner: THAT'S WRITTEN INTO THE STATE LAW.
01:45:37.307: >> I WITH WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT. THE MAXIMUM WAS SET BY THE STATE.
01:45:42.011: >> Councilmember Hayner:  AND THAT'S WHAT THIS IS, CORRECT.
01:45:44.848: >> RIGHT.
01:45:45.148: >> Councilmember Hayner: BECAUSE I REMEMBER SEEING THE FIVE IN THERE. WELL, I -- I'M NOT SURE I CAN SUPPORT THIS ESPECIALLY FOR THE RENEWAL. OF COURSE, ONCE YOU ARE IN BUSINESS, YOU WILL HAVE THE MONEY FOR THE RENEWAL. I'M NOT SURE I SUPPORT THIS MAXIMUM, ALTHOUGH, I WOULD LOVE IT AS COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI SAID TO HAVE THIS MONEY DIRECTED PROPERLY TO PLACES THAT WE THINK ARE KIND OF EQUITABLE USES FOR WHAT IT -- YOU KNOW THE PERMIT IS BEING APPLIED FOR. THERE WILL BE NO EXCESS IF IT COSTS US $5,000 TO PROCESS THESE. NOW, MY OTHER QUESTION AROUND THAT WOULD BE IS THERE ANY SITUATION WHERE NIP APPLIES FOR THIS AND IS DENIED EXCEPT FOR EGREGIOUS CASES THEY DON'T MEET THE STATE LAW REQUIREMENTS. WE ARE NOT GOING TO DENY ANY OF THESE, ARE WE? IN THAT CASE, THE COST DOESN'T SEEM -- I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT IS THAT WE ARE CHECKING OUT ON THESE. COULD SOMEONE FILL ME IN? I'M SORRY TO ASK THESE ARE COUNCIL QUESTIONS OR AGENDA QUESTIONS. WHAT IS IT THAT WE ARE DOING FOR THAT $5,000? ANYONE?
01:46:47.811: >> City Atty. Postema: I HAVEN'T LOOKED AT THAT ISSUE. I WILL HAVE KRISTEN LARKHAM COME DOWN. I  KNOW THIS  HAS WORKED WITH DK DELACOURT ON THIS.
01:47:00.890: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU. IT SEEMS LIKE A LARGE ISSUE. WHEN WE LOOK AT THE MAE TRIX FOR EVALUATING AND ONE OF THOSE THINGS IS EQUITY AND THIS IS JUST -- WRITING THAT CHECK IS PAY BIG EQUITY ISSUE, TO ME.
01:47:18.241: >> Mayor Taylor: MS. BEAUDRY AND THEN GRAND AND THEN HAYNER -- RAMLAWI.
01:47:22.545: >> Clerk Beaudry: I CAN CLARIFY THE MEDICAL MARIJUANA LAW AND MEDICAL APPROVE A MAXIMUM OF $5,000. AND WHEN THE MEDICAL WAS APPROVED, HE IT WAS -- WE STATED THAT OTHER MUNICIPALITIES THAT ARE LICENSING MARIJUANA ALSO CHARGE THE MAXIMUM. SO THIS RESOLUTION WAS JUST TO EXPAND IT FROM THE MEDICAL FEE TO ALL MARIJUANA PERMITS.
01:47:50.573: >> Councilmember Hayner:  AND SO ADDITIONAL PERMIT TYPE WOULD BE THE REGISTERED CARRIER.
01:47:55.545: >> Clerk Beaudry: CORRECT.
01:47:56.112: >> Councilmember Hayner:  THECR?
01:47:58.715: >> Clerk Beaudry: MM-HMM.
01:47:59.282: >> Councilmember Hayner:  ANY OF THOSE THINGS? CONSUMPTION? SO THIS IS -- THIS IS PAY SMALL BUSINESS MATTER THEN. THIS IS NOT FOR THE CASUAL USER. DOES THIS -- THIS ISN'T THE HOME PERMITTING, RIGHT? THERE'S -- THIS IS ONLY FOR THE FIVE BUSINESS TYPES. OKAY. THERE ARE SEVEN. OKAY. THANK YOU.
01:48:17.700: >> Clerk Beaudry: BUT IT WAS NOT BASED ON STAFF TIME. IT WAS BASED ON THE MAXIMUM ALLOWED UNDER THE LAW.
01:48:23.840: >> Councilmember Hayner: OKAY. SO WILL WE HAVE AN EXCESS? IF STAFF TIME IS NOT CHEWED UP BY THAT?
01:48:31.281: >> THE STAFF TIME -- WE ARE NOT ADDING STAFF AND THE STAFF WILL BE THERE ANYWAY. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT EXCESS, IT'S JUST NEW REVENUE INTO THE CITY FOR ALREADY EXISTING STAFF RESOURCES.
01:48:43.159: >> Councilmember Hayner:  AND SO THIS IS FOR THE CLERK'S OFFICE THEN?
01:48:47.564: >> Clerk Beaudry: THE CLERK'S OFFICE COLLECTS THE REVENUE BUT IT'S GENERAL FUND REVENUE.
01:48:51.067: >> Councilmember Hayner:  NO, I WAS LOOKING FOR THE -- NO, THANK YOU. I WANT TO KNOW THE ULTIMATE DESTINATION OF THOSE FEES.
01:48:59.042: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
01:49:00.610: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. REMEMBER AT OUR LAST MEETING, WHEN WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS, THERE WERE A LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT WHAT THESE NEW BUSINESSES MIGHT COST TO THE CITY IN TERMS OF SOME OTHER RESOURCES, LIKE PUBLIC SAFETY, FOR EXAMPLE, AND WHETHER YOU BELIEVE THAT TO BE TRUE OR NOT. YOU KNOW, ANY TIME THERE IS A NEW BUSINESS TYPE, THERE ARE GOING TO BE SOME STAFFING COSTS, EDUCATION, YOU KNOW, WHAT HAVE YOU. SO $5,000 TO ME DOESN'T SEEM LIKE AN EXORBITANT COST. WE HAVE A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER AT THE TABLE. I'M SURE THERE ARE OTHER COSTS THAT ARE MUCH LARGER BARRIERS TO STARTING A NEW BUSINESS THAN A $5,000 PERMIT FEE. NOT TO -- NOT TO DOWNPLAY THAT CONCERN, BUT IF THIS HAS WORKED FOR US IN THE PAST, WITH THE MEDICAL BUSINESS, I THINK IT SEEMS TOTALLY REASONABLE TO KEEP IT THIS WAY FOR ALL THE OTHER TYPES.
01:49:50.860: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBERCR RAMLAWI.
01:49:53.029: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I APPRECIATE THE SECOND TIME TO TALK ON THE MATTER AND AS COUNCILMEMBER GRAND,ES, AS A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER, I LOOK AT THIS AND SAY, YEAH, IT IS A LOT OF MONEY, BUT, YOU KNOW, FOR MY FOOD LICENSE, IT'S $1,000 A YEAR. SO, YOU KNOW, $5,000 IS A LOT, I AGREE. BUT THERE IS A LOT OF RESOURCES THAT HAVE ALREADY GONE INTO THIS, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU. I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH TIME THE LEGAL DEPARTMENT HAS PUT INTO DRAFTING THE ORDINANCE AND REVIEWING THE LAW, GIVING US ADVICE, PLUS ALL THE EXTERNAL COSTS THAT MAY COME WITH IT, THAT WE'RE NOT SURE OF. SO IT WILL TAKE A YEAR OR MORE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT OUR TRUE COSTS ARE, WHAT OUR OTHER COSTS COMING IN THAT WE DIDN'T ANTICIPATE. BUT TO SAY THIS IS A BARRIER TO, YOU KNOW, THE ENTREPRENEURIAL SPIRIT OF AMERICA, I DON'T BELIEVE SO.
01:50:55.792: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
01:50:58.461: >> Councilmember Lumm: JUST LIKE TO PROVIDE AN OBSERVATION FROM LIQUOR LICENSING COMMITTEE. AS YOU KNOW, COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER AND I APPRECIATE YOU SERVE Y ON THE LIQUOR LICENSE REVIEWS. AND THE ANNUAL REVIEWS ARE A MASSIVE UNDERSTATEMENT. IT INVOLVES THE TREASURE'S OFFICE, THE POLICE DEPARTMENT, THE BUILDING DEPARTMENT, THE FIRE DEPARTMENT, AIM SURE I'M MISSING SOMEONE. AND EVERY BUSINESS THAT HAS A LIQUOR LICENSE IN THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR IS REVIEWED BY ALL OF THOSE FUNCTIONS ANNUALLY, AND WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT INCREASING THE $90 RENEWAL FEE ANNUALLY AND I -- I APPRECIATE THAT MS. BEAUDRY HAS BEEN LOOKING INTO THIS BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK WE'RE CAPTURING -- RECOVERING ALL THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT. THERE ARE SOME FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS KIND OF WORK, AND I ALSO SUPPORT THIS FEE PROPOSAL. AGAIN, AS NO NOTED BY COUNCILMER GRAND. AND MS. BEAUDRY, THE FEES WE CHARGE MEDICAL LARGE LARGE FACILITIES AND BUSINESSES.
01:52:25.081: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
01:52:37.226: >> Councilmember Griswold: ABSENT.
01:52:42.932: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES.

01:52:49.739: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES.
01:52:51.841: >> Councilmember Hayner:  NO.
01:52:52.441: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES.
01:52:54.110: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION CARRIES.
01:52:56.746: >> Mayor Taylor: DB-1, RESOLUTION TO APPROVE SHELL GAS STATION PUD SITE PLAN AND LANDSCAPE MODIFICATION, 2679 ANN ARBOR-SALINE ROAD. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER EATON. DISCUSSION, PLEASE OF DB-1? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. DB-2, RESOLUTION TO APPROVE THE 1831 TRAVER ROAD LESLIE SCIENCE AND NATURE CENTER BROWNFIELD PLAN. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRAND. DISCUSSION OF DB-2? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
01:53:31.247: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU ALL FOR, HOPEFULLY YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS. THAT WAS A REAL THING WE RAN INTO OVER THERE AND WE NEED TO TAKE CARE OF IT. IT'S -- I'M SORRY THAT THIS HAPPENED TO THE CITY AND I'M GLAD IT WILL NOT BE HAPPENING MOVING FORWARD AS WE ARE LOOKING AT ALL PHASE ONES OF PROPERTIES WE TAKE ON. SORRY TO THE P TAXPAYER BUT HOPEFULLY WE HAVE ANOTHER 1 HUB YEARS OUT OF THE LESLIE SCIENCE AND NATURE CENTER. AND LESLIE AND THE GOLF COURSE AND OTHER VALUABLE PROPERTIES IN THE MORE OF THESE WILDLIFE CORRIDORS AN CONNECTIVITY WE CAN CREATE, I THINK THE BETTER OFF WE ARE MOVING FORWARD IN THE FUTURE. SO THANK YOU FOR SUPPORTING THIS OUT OF THE BROWNFIELD COMMITTEE.
01:54:23.966: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER. BENZ IS DEREK DELACOURT STILL IN THE BUILDING.
01:54:33.442: >> HE'S NOT HERE.
01:54:34.577: >> Councilmember Bannister: OKAY. LAST NIGHT AT CAUCUS, ONE OF THEM ASKED ABOUT D.T.E. HELPING TO CONTRACT FUNDS FOR THIS CLEANUP. AND I'M NOT SEEING THAT IN THE RECORD, BUT I WASN'T SURE. I PROMISED I WOULD RAISE IT FOR THE RESIDENT WHO ASKED YESTERDAY.
01:54:53.596: >> THIS PARTICULAR CLEANUP IS BEING FUNDED FROM THE BROWNFIELD WHAT WE CALL A BROWNFIELD LBRF FUND. D.T.E. HAS NOT YET CONTRIBUTED TO THAT FUND. SO THIS IS COMING OUT OF PREVIOUSLY CAPTURED FUNDS.
01:55:13.516: >> Councilmember Bannister: THANK YOU.
01:55:15.618: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:55:17.820: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN ANSWER THIS MR. CRAWFORD WHAT IS D.T.E.'S OWNERSHIP IN THE PROPERTY? DO WE KNOW? CAN SOMEONE HERE SHED SOME LIGHT ON THAT? BECAUSE WE WERE TOLD THIS LAST NIGHT. I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S TRUE. WHETHER THEY WOULD HAVE ANY OWNERSHIP IN THE PROPERTY.
01:55:35.371: >> I WOULD HAVE TO FOLLOW-UP ON THAT.
01:55:38.007: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: OKAY.
01:55:43.279: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I DON'T THINK THAT D.T.E. HAS ANY SORT OF -- THEY MADE AN INVESTMENT AND A DONATION TO HELP FUND THE SOLAR SYSTEMS ON THAT SOLAR HOUSE, AND IT'S NAME THE D.T.E. HOUSE AND SO FORTH. I DON'T BE THEY HAVE ANY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SITE WHATSOEVER. NOW TO SPEAK TO WHAT MR. CRAWFORD SAID, THESE ARE FUNDS THAT COME FROM OTHER APPLICATIONS AND IN THE FUTURE, D.T.E. WILL BE PUTTING IN HANDILY FOR THE BROADWAY OR THE -- YOU KNOW, BROADWAY SITE, THE BROADWAY PARK DEVELOPMENT AND THEY WILL BE MAKING SOME DONATIONS AS PART OF THAT BUT THIS IS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH THAT IN THIS WAY. JUST TO ANSWER THE RESIDENT FROM LAST NIGHT, D.T.E., AS FAR AS I'M AWARE AND I DIDN'T SEE ANY REPORTS, AND COUNCILMEMBER SMITH IS NODDING IN ASCENT, THEY DON'T HA ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SIGHT WHATSOEVER.
01:56:34.430: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] ALL OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED -- DO I NEED TO SAY? NO, I DON'T NEED TO SAY. IT'S JUST APPROVED. DS-1, RESOLUTION AUTHORIZING PUBLICATION OF NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE GENERAL OBLIGATION CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT BONDS TO FUND DOWNTOWN DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY ANN ASHLEY PARKING STRUCTURE EXPANSION PROJECT. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, AND SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI. DISCUSSION OF DS-1? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
01:57:07.830: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. I MAY SPEAK TWICE ON THIS. WE THIS A PRETTY PRODUCTIVE WORK SESSION LAST MONDAY WITH THE DDA FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE WE WERE ALL SEATED TOGETHER AND DISCUSSIONS WENT BACK AND FORTH AND, YOU KNOW, AT THE END, I FELT LIKE THERE WERE A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT POLICY DIFFERENCES AND THE NEEDS FOR THIS EXPANSION WERE BEING ARTICULATED IN TWO DIFFERENT SPHERES AND ONE IS FUTURE DEVELOPMENT AND THE NEED FOR FUTURE GROWTH AND THE LOSS OF FUTURE SURFACE LOTS AND THEN THIS' THE OTHER ONE, TALKING ABOUT LONG WAIT LISTS, MEMBERS IN THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY HAVE SPOKEN OUT RECENTLY NOW. WE GOT A LETTER FROM SPARK TODAY ADVOCATING FOR THE ADDITION. AND I JUST FEEL LIKE AS A BODY, WE NEED TO GET TO GO AND I WILL BE WORKING ON THIS, SHORTLY WITH STAFF TO REFORM OUR POLICY AND REDIRECT THE D.D.A. IN WAYS SO WE CAN CLEAR UP THE DIFFERENCES THAT CURRENTLY EXIST. I THINK IT'S OVER DUE. I THINK IT'S NECESSARY. AND I DON'T THINK WE NEED NECESSARILY TO VOTE THIS DOWN OR VOTE THIS UP TONIGHT. I THINK THOSE POLICY DIFFERENCES MUST BE ADDRESSED FIRST AND THEN TAKE A VOTE ON IT THEN. SO I MOVE TO HAVE THIS POSTPONED TO A DATE -- TO A FUTURE DATE THAT WE CAN AGREE ON, THAT WE CAN HAVE THESE DIFFERENCES WORKED OUT. SO I CAN EXPAND ON THAT HATER, BUT I JUST -- THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT I WOULD BE MORE COMFORTABLE WITH ONCE THESE POLICY DIFFERENCES ARE MANAGED TO BE WORKED OUT.
01:59:24.867: >> Mayor Taylor: I THINK FOR A POSTPONEMENT WE LOOK FOR A DATE.
01:59:28.604: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: WELL, SINCE OUR CITY ADMINISTRATOR IS NOT HERE, I'M NOT SURE IF SUSAN PALATE IS HERE, WHO CAN ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS WHEN IT COMES TO THESE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE. AND THE TWO ISSUES ARE WITH OUR WAIT LISTS AND CITIZEN ED, THANK YOU FOR GETTING US THAT INFORMATION WITH YOUR FOIA REQUESTS. BUT AFTER REVIEWING THEM MYSELF, I FIND IT VERY HARD TO UNDERSTAND WHERE THE DEMAND. IS I THINK WE HAVE AN ANTIQUATED WAY OF TRACKING THE SYSTEM AND KNOWING WHERE OUR TRUE NEEDS ARE IN REALTIME. SO I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THAT WAIT LIST DONE A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY, WHERE WE GET QUARTERLY, IF NOT MONTHLY REPORTS AS TO WHERE THE DEMAND IS AND HAVE A BETTER SYSTEM, PERHAPS, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE PEOPLE ON ALL DIFFERENT LISTS ASKING FOR EVERYTHING. I MEAN, BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A DEPOSIT REQUIRED, YOU KNOW? LET'S TEASE OUT SOME OF THIS AND MAKE SURE THAT IF YOU WANT TO BE ON A WAIT LIST, THEN PUT SOME SKIN IN THE GAME. HOW COMMITTED ARE YOU TO THIS, RATHER THAN JUST APPLY EVERYWHERE, ALL THE TIME, AND WE HAVE ACE CASE WHERE CERTAIN PEOPLE ARE GIVEN PERMITS AND OTHERS ARE NOT. AND WE'RE NOT REALLY CLEAR -- I'M NOT, AT LEAST, AS TO HOW THAT IS DONE. AND WE'RE GIVING PERMITS TO PEOPLE WHO INSTEAD OF BUILDING PARKING, WE'RE GIVING THEM -- YOU KNOW, GIVE US A FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTION AND WE'LL ALLOW YOU TO BUILD WITHOUT THAT PARKING. I THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE CHANGED. I DON'T THINK THAT'S A GOOD PRACTICE. I THINK IT'S LEADING TO A LOT OF CONFLICT IN OUR COMMUNITY AND IN OUR DOWNTOWN. AND I LOOK TO KNOW HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE FOR THAT SYSTEM -- FOR THE WAITING LIST TO BE ADDRESSED AND I CAN SPEAK WITH OUR CITY ADMINISTRATOR AND OTHERS AND STAFF TO FIND OUT HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE TO DRESS THE OTHER ISSUES THAT WE HAVE WITH ALLOWING DEVELOPERS TO PAY FOR PARKING FROM THE DDA RATHER THAN BUILD IT THEMSELVES. THOSE ARE TWO ISSUES THAT I REALLY NEED TO GET A BETTER COMFORT LEVEL WITH, BEFORE APPROVING THIS AT THE CURRENT STATE.
02:01:56.852: >> AND THANK YOU FOR THAT. I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE COUNCIL FOR AN EXCELLENT WORK SESSION LAST WEEK AS WAS MENTIONED. IT WAS A REALLY GOOD DISCUSSION. AND IT REALLY CENTERED A LOT ON THE POLICIES AND THE QUANTITIES OF PARKING AND THE FUTURE AROUND PARKING AND IT WAS A REALLY HELPFUL DIALOGUE AND DEFINITELY WANTED TO BE CONTINUED. TO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT THE DEPOSIT, WE HAVEN'T YET THOUGHT ABOUT THAT, THAT'S A GREAT IDEA. SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN DISCUSSED AT THE OPERATIONS COMMITTEE THAT WE HAVE NOT PURSUED TO BREAK IT APART AND ISSUE PERMIT SOLELY TO INDIVIDUALS. AT THIS POINT, A BUSINESS CAN ASK FOR PERMITS OR THE PROPER OWNER CAN ASK FOR PERMITS. THE OTHER IDEA IS TO MAKE IT PERSON SPECIFIC. THAT'S ANOTHER CHANGE TO HOW WE WOULD BE MEASURING THEY ARE WAIT BECAUSE IT WOULD NOW BE DOWN TO AN INDIVIDUAL. SO THOSE -- THAT'S A GREAT SUGGESTION. TO YOUR POINT ABOUT WORKING WITH OURSELVES TO CHANGE THE ORDINANCES, AS RELATES TO PARKING, I KNOW A QUESTION THAT WE HAVE FOR COUNCIL IS, IN ADDITION TO CHANGING THE CONTRIBUTION IN LIE LIEUS. IT -S IT TIME TO QUESTION AFFORDABLE HOUSING WITH THE 415 PROPERTY AND THE OLD WILD LOT TO EXAMINE THAT PORTION OF THE ORDINANCE. DO WE TEASE OUT HOW WE HAVE PARKING MAXIMUM SYSTEMS AND COULD WE BEGIN WITH AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE DOWNTOWN. THAT'S ANOTHER WAY TO LESSEN THE PRESSURE ON THE PERMIT SYSTEM.
02:03:24.640: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH US. WE DO NEED A PARTNER ON THE OTHER SIDE. I DO NOT WANT TO CONFLATE ABLE HOUSING WITH THIS CURRENT ISSUE. THEY ARE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE. WE CAN DECIDE ON THAT WHEN IT COMES TO THOSE PROPERTIES AT THAT TIME, CITY-OWNED PROPERTY, WE CAN DO WHATEVER WE WANT, WRITE IT HOW WE WILL AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING THE BEAUTY ABOUT IT IS THOSE FOLKS DO NOT OWN CARS AT THE SAME RATE THAT FOLKS WHO OTHERWISE WOULD LIVE DOWNTOWN HAVE THE AFFORDABILITY TO OWN A CAR AND PAY FOR THE PARKING AND EVERYTHING THAT GOES ALONG WITH TRANSPORTATION COSTS. MY SENSE IS THAT THAT NEED IS NOT AS GREAT. AND SO WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO TACKLE AFFORDABLE HOUSING NOW FOR DECADES. I DON'T WANT TO WAIT FOR THAT TO BE SOLVED UNTIL WE ADDRESS MORE SIMPLE MATTER THAT WE THAT IS CAUSING A LOT OF FRICTION. SO I DON'T WANT TO ENGAGE IN THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING WITH THIS, AT THIS TIME. I WOULD LIKE TO KEEP IT SIMPLE AND KEEP IT CLEAR, IF I COULD.
02:04:36.612: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION?
02:04:40.082: >> Councilmember Lumm: IS THE MOVE TO POSTPONE IT.
02:04:42.084: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  THE DATE WOULD BE FIRST MEETING IN JANUARY.
02:04:44.720: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE AIL SECOND ON THAT?
02:04:47.322: >> Councilmember Eaton: I WILL SECOND.
02:04:48.790: >> Mayor Taylor: SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER EATON. FURTHER DISCUSSION POSTPONEMENT? COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
02:04:54.696: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES, I'M RELUCTANT TO SUPPORT A POSTPONEMENT. WE ALREADY POSTPONED IT. OBVIOUSLY I HAVE NOT ALWAYS AGREED WITH MANY DDA RECOMMENDATIONS BUT, YOU KNOW, THEY REMOVED THE $4 MILLION BUILDOUT. THAT'S NO LONGER PART OF THE PLAN. I THINK THEY GOT IT RIGHT THIS TIME. I DID ASK FOR WAIT LIST INFORMATION. YOU SAW THE RESPONSE. THANK YOU FOR THE RESPONSE FOR THAT, FOR ALL THE STRUCTURES DOWNTOWN. I DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL CHANGE BETWEEN NOW AND JANUARY. THE WAIT LIST IS OVER 6,000 NOW. AND EVEN IF THE REAL DEMAND IS JUST HALF THAT, 3,000 IS STILL A HUGE UNMET DEMAND. AND SO IF YOU BACK OUT, AS YOU SAID -- INDICATED, COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, YOU DON'T WANT TO TALK CONFLATE THIS WITH THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING DISCUSSION FOR THESE PROPERTIES, AND THAT'S CERTAINLY IN THE BACKGROUND. THERE'S TALK ABOUT CONVERTING ALL OF THESE SURFACE LOTS AND USING THEM FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND NOT FOR PARKING BUT TAKING THAT OUT AGAIN. WE KNOW THAT, AGAIN, IF YOU JUST -- IF THE WAIT -- IF THE MONTHLY PERMIT WAIT LIST IS OVERSTATED BY A FACTOR OF TWO, THAT'S -- WE STILL HAVE 3,000 PLUS PEOPLE LOOKING FOR MONTHLY PERMITS. SO I DON'T SEE THINGS CHANGING IN THIS WHOLE LANDSCAPE BETWEEN NOW AND -- WE HAD A GOOD DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS LAST AY. SO I -- YOU KNOW, I THINK THERE'S MORE URGENCY TO MOVE ON THIS AND NOT DELAY, FRANKLY.
02:06:43.872: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION ON THE POSTPONEMENT. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
02:06:47.476: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I BELIEVE THERE NEEDS TO BE REFORM. THERE NEEDS TO BE DIFFERENT WAYS OF DOING BUSINESS. AND I WOULD FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE APPROVING THIS WHEN THAT IS DONE. TO SAY WELL, MAYBE THAT WILL GET DONE -- THESE ARE THINGS THAT NEED TO BEED. THESE ARE THINGS THAT NEED TO BE CLEANED UP NOW. THIS HAS BEEN TOLD TO BE THE FASTEST AND THE CHEAPEST WAY TO ADD PARKING TO OUR SYSTEM. IT'S ESSENTIALLY SHOVEL READY. I DON'T SEE ANY OF THOSE SURFACE LOTS MOVING ANY TIME SOON. THERE'S NOTHING IN THE PIPE WORK. THERE'S NOTHING IN THE PIPELINES. THIS CAN BE DONE IN UNDER TWO YEARS OR TWO YEARS' TIME. SO I WOULD RATHER CLEAN UP OUR HOUSE A LITTLE BIT BEFORE WE MOVE FORWARD.
02:07:34.856: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION POSTPONEMENT? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
02:07:38.460: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES, I POSTPONED THE FIRST TIME SO WE COULD HAVE OUR WORK SESSION, WHICH WAS, YOU KNOW, INTERESTING. IT WAS MY FIRST ONE. I SAT IN ON SOME OTHER ONES, BUT THAT WAS PRETTY INTERESTING. AND I -- YOU KNOW, LIKE MANY WORK SESSIONS, YOU COME OUT WITH AS MANY QUESTIONS AS YOU WENT IN WITH, AND THAT WAS CERTAINLY THE CASE ON THIS TOPIC. AND SO I WOULD HAPPILY POSTPONE THIS TO JANUARY 6th. I THINK THAT'S THE FIRST MEETING, IF ONLY IT WOULD GIVE ME MORE TIME TO HAVE MY GIANT LIST OF QUESTIONS ANSWERED. AND I WAS SURPRISED TO HAVE A POSTPONEMENT MOTION COME FORWARD BUT I FULLY SUPPORT IT.
02:08:16.631: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER SMITH?
02:08:18.133: >> Councilmember Smith: I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT POSTPONEMENT LARGELY BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, AS THIS IS, I'M NOT LIKELY TO SUPPORT IT. YOU KNOW, ONE THE RATIONALES THAT WE HAVE BEEN GIVEN FOR EXPANDING THE DECK IS TO REPLACE SURFACE LOT SPACES THAT WILL BE LOST IN THE COMING YEARS AS A RESULT OF SOME OF THOSE LOTS BEING DEVELOPED ANY DEVELOPMENT ON THOSE LOSSES WOULD HAVE TO BE APPROVED FOR THOSE SPACES TO BE LOST AND I THINK ANY EXPANSION OF THIS DECK SHOULD BE TIED VERY SPECIFICALLY TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THOSE SPACES INTO THE CREATION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IF WE MOVE AHEAD TO PARKING EXPANSION FIRST, WITHOUT A DIRECT LINK BETWEEN THOSE TWO THINGS, I THINK IT SETS A TERRIBLE PRECEDENT THAT WE ARE PRIORITIZING CAR STORAGE OVER HOUSING. I THINK CREATING AFFORDABLE, CARBON NEUTRAL HOUSING SO PEOPLE CAN LIVE CLOSE TO THEIR JOBS AND NOT NEED A CAR OR SOMETHING, IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO DO, IF WE HOPE TO ACHIEVE CARBON NEUTRALITY. THE PUBLIC HAS HEARD ME TALK ABOUT THIS A LOT, BUT, YOU KNOW, IN MOVING AHEAD WITH, THIS WE ARE PRIORITIZING DRIVING DOWNTOWN AND IN THE FACE OF CLIMATE CHANGE, AND KNOWING THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF RESIDENTS THAT WANT TO SEE ACTION INSTEAD OF JUST WORDS, AND ACTUAL PROGRESS TOWARDS LOCAL CARBON NEUTRALITY, WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE SACRIFICES TO HOPE TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL, AND ONE OF THESE SACRIFICES IS WE CANNOT DILEWD OURSELVES INTO THINKING THAT DRIVING BY YOURSELF AND DRIVING AND PARKING DOWNTOWN CHEAPLY DOESN'T HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT AND CONTRIBUTING TO CLIMATE CHANGE. AND SO FOR ME, IT'S NOT A DIFFICULT DECISION TO NOT SUPPORT THIS ABSENT THE OTHER TIES. ULTIMATELY, BUILDING MORE PARKING DOES NOTHING TO INCENTIVIZE BEHAVIORAL CHANGE HERE. IT DOES THE EXACT OPPOSITE. WE ARE MAKING IT EASIER TO DO WHAT WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO DO. AND THEN LASTLY, ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO DRIVE DOWNTOWN IS AAT ODDS WITH WHAT I HEAR FROM A LOT OF RESIDENTS THAT THEY WANT DOWNTOWN TO BE A MORE PEDESTRIANLY FRIENDLY PLACE, OUR HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF CAR BIKE CRASHES IS IN DOWNTOWN. I BELIEVE THAT, YOU KNOW, WE CAN APPROACH THIS BETTER. I THINK CONTINUES TO COME UP WITH THE SAME SOLUTIONS FOR PROBLEMS THAT ARE ONGOING AND SYSTEMIC, JUST LEADS US INTO MORE OF THE SAME PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE. I THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK FOR A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WAY TO HANDLE PARKING IN THIS COMMUNITY.
02:10:53.355: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE POSTPONEMENT. I'M SORRY, COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN AND THEN LUMM.
02:10:57.225: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I WOULD SUPPORT POSTPONEMENT AS WELL AS I DISCUSSED AT THE LAST COUNCIL MEETING. I HAVE A LOT OF HESITATION IN THIS FOR A LOST REASONS THAT COUNCILMEMBER SMITH ARTICULATED. I THINK THERE ARE FOUR KEY ARGUMENTS TO CONSTRUCTIONING THIS PARKING AND FOR ME, ONLY ONE RINGS TRUE AND IS COMPELLING AND THAT IS THAT INCREASING THE PARKING AND ABANDONING THE STRUCTURE WOULD INCREASE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF SURFACE PARKING LOTS WHICH ARE OBJECTIVELY UNDER UTILIZED ASSETS THAT THIS COMMUNITY HAS. HOW I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THOSE ASSETS BE USED IS IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND IF YOU RECALL, THIS BODY ASKED STAFF, THE HOUSING COMMISSION TO REPORT BACK ON THE VIABILITY OF CONSTRUCTING AFFORDABLE HOUSING ON A NUMBER OF SITES, SOME OF WHICH WERE IN THE JO U DOWNTOWN AREA IN THE DA DISTRICT. THE ONE ADVISORY BOARD THAT COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER AND I SIT ON, HAVE A SNEAK PEEK OF THOSE MANY PROPERTIES. THREE UNDER THE DDA DISTRICT AND IN THIS PARKING DISTRICT, AND ARE PRIMED AND, YOU KNOW, ABOUT AS DEVELOPABLE AS LAND GETS. AND SO I THINK THAT THE STRINGS THAT COUNCILMEMBER SMITH ARTICULATED ARE REAL OPPORTUNITY ON THE IMMEDIATE HORIZON AND I THINK THAT THERE IS THAT OPPORTUNITY BUT I DON'T THINK THAT THAT OPPORTUNITY EXISTS YET. AND I THINK THAT THAT CONVERSATION IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN TAKE UP IN THE NEW YEAR IN A MEANINGFUL, SUBSTANTIVE WAY SO THAT WE CAN PURSUE AFFORDABLE HOUSING, PURSUE AFFORDABLE HOUSING DOWNTOWN AND TAKE CARE OF THE EXTERNALITIES AROUND OUR PARKING THAT THAT MAY CREATE.
02:12:43.598: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
02:12:47.802: >> Councilmember Lumm: YEAH, I -- [ OFF MICROPHONE COMMENTS ] SORRY ABOUT THAT. THANKS. I JUST SAID THAT ANN ASHLEY IS ONE OF THE BUSIEST STRUCTURES AND THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE WAYS TO ADD CAPACITY AND COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN JUST NOTED THAT THE HOUSING AND HUMAN SERVICES ADVISORY BOARD IS LOOKING AT THE -- THE SURFACE LOTS IN THIS VICINITY TO BE REDEVELOPED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SO TAKING THAT PARKING OUT OF THE SYSTEM. I DO THINK THAT THE CASE FOR ADDING TO ANN ASHLEY IS COMPELLING, AND HONESTLY, I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHAT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WE NEED TO CONVINCE US OF THAT. I -- YOU KNOW, SO I'M HEARING, YOU KNOW, CARS CONFLICT WITH OUR VALUES. I WONDER WHICH COUNCILMEMBER HERE DOESN'T HAVE A CAR. AND, YOU KNOW, IF YOU BELIEVE THAT -- AND I NO HE  KNOW THAT F MY COLLEAGUES DO THAT NOW IS THE TIME TO TAKE CONCRETE ACTION TO DISCOURAGE CAR USE AND MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR RESIDENTS WHO WANT TO DRIVE DOWNTOWN, YOU SHOULD VOTE AGAINST THIS. FORGET ABOUT POSTPONING IT. BUT IF YOU BELIEVE, AS I DO, THAT IN THIS AUTO CENTRIC WORLD THAT WE LIVE IN, AND WITH ANN ARBOR'S LESS ROBUST MASS TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS, INADEQUATE PARKING IS A REAL ECONOMIC RISK TO OUR DOWNTOWN. AND I -- I WOULD SUGGEST THE MORE PRUDENT STRATEGY IS TO APPROVE THIS AND THEN WE CAN HAVE THIS ROBUST CONVERSATION ABOUT THE WISDOM OF, YOU KNOW, DISCOURAGING PERSONAL VEHICLES AND WE CAN DO THINGS LIKE -- YOU KNOW, WE CAN ASK THE DDA TO PUBLISH THE CURRENT MONTHLY PARKING PERMIT LIST FOR ALL THE STRUCTURES PUBLISHED OPEN THE DDA'S WEBSITE, UPDATE IT REGULARLY, THERE'S BEEN SOME SUGGESTIONS THAT MAYBE WE SHOULD -- TO ADDRESS COUNCIL'S CONCERNS ABOUT USING OUR PUBLIC SYSTEM FOR DEVELOPMENTS. THAT MODIFY THE ZONING ORDINANCE TO ELIMINATE THE OPTION, THAT DEVELOPERS NOW HAVE, TO SEEK A CONTRACT FROM THE DDA TO SATISFY THE PARKING REQUIREMENT FOR THEIR DEVELOPMENT. WE CAN ADDRESS THAT. WE CAN BE -- WE CAN MULTITASK ON THIS ONE, BUT I THINK, YOU KNOW -- I THINK KNOWING WHAT WE KNOW, YOU KNOW, POSTPONING ISN'T -- ISN'T THE RIGHT ACTION TO TAKE AT THIS TIME.
02:15:50.852: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER GRAND?
02:15:55.623: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. AS I HAVE ALL ALONG WITH, THIS I FEEL PRETTY CONFLICTED. I THINK LIKE SOME OF MY OTHER COLLEAGUES DO ABOUT THIS. MY BIGGEST FEAR IN NOT APPROVING THIS IS THAT WHEN WE GO TO -- TO TRY TO REDEVELOP THE SURFACE LOTS, THAT WE WILL USE THE FACT THAT WE DON'T HAVE ADDITIONAL PARKING AS AN EXCUSE NOT TO APPROVE. SO I SEE THIS AS KIND OF A CHICKEN AND EGG CONUNDRUM. IF WE -- YOU KNOW, WE ARE BEING ASKED TO APPROVE THE PARKING SO WE CAN REDEVELOP THE SURFACE LOTS AND WE SAY UNTIL THE SURFACE LOTS ARE REDEVELOPED, WE CAN'T HAVE THE PARKING BUT MY FEAR IS THAT THAT THIRD PIECE THAT IF WE DON'T HAVE THE PARKING THAT THAT WILL BE THE BARRIER. IT WAS CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT CAME UP A LOT IN THE, YOU KNOW, PRIOR LIBRARY LOT DISCUSSIONS FOR NOT APPROVING THE CORE SPACES. AND SO -- SO THAT, TO ME IS MY BIGGEST FEAR. I'M ALSO A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT JUST IN TERMS OF WHO IS RESPONSIBLE TO MAKE THOSE CHANGES BETWEEN NOW AND JANUARY. SO I THINK I WOULD LIKE A LITTLE CLARITY ON THAT MAYBE FROM COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI OR STAFF, IF THE IDEA IS TO TRY TO MAKE THOSE CHANGES SO THAT WE GET RID OF PARKING IN LIEU. I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHO IS -- YOU KNOW, I WOULD ASSUME THAT WE WOULD PLAY A ROLE IN THAT SOMEWHERE AS A COUNCIL, SO THAT IS TO ME IS MORE ON US THAN THE DDA AND HAVING A LOT OF EXPERTISE IN THIS AREA, BUT I'M JUST -- I FEEL LIKE THAT THAT'S MORE ON US THAN ON THEM, AND I'M NOT SURE THAT IT'S RIGHT TO PUNISH THEM FOR OUR OWN INACTIONS. SO THAT'S WHERE I'M KIND OF TORN HERE, AND I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR OTHER THOUGHTS.
02:17:45.533: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION POSTPONEMENT? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
02:17:48.603: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I GUESS SINCE YOU ASKED FOR OTHER THOUGHTS, I DON'T SEE A POSTPONEMENT AS AI PUNISHMENT, BUT TO HAVE A WAY TO HAVE OUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED IN THE CONVERSATION. I MEAN, WHAT ACTIONS WOULD WE TAKE BETWEEN NOW AND THEN? SO WHEN -- IF THE PROBLEM WAS WE HAVE A LACK OF DOWNTOWN PARKING, AND THE SOLUTION IS BUILD PORE PARKING, WELL, THAT'S JUST ONE SOLUTION. ANOTHER SOLUTION IS FREE UP SPACES IN THE STRUCTURES THROUGH OTHER MEANS. DO WE CHARGE ENOUGH RIGHT NOW? PERHAPS IF OUR STRUCTURES ARE FULL, WE'RE NOT CHARGING ENOUGH. PERHAPS THERE'S A TIERED SYSTEM OF USES OR COSTS FOR USERS THAT NEED TO BE CREATED. SO SOMEBODY WHO IS A DOWNTOWN EMFLOWEE, THEY ARE PAYING $1.20 AN HOUR, BUT SOMEBODY WHO ISN'T IS PAYING MORE. SO WE CREATE THE RIGHT KINDS OF SPACES AND USES IN OUR STRUCTURES. THAT'S ONE EXAMPLE. SO WHEN WE LOOK AT -- WE TALK ABOUT PUBLISHING A WAIT LIST, I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE USE LIST. IF THE CITY AND THE COUNTY ARE 300 OR 400 SPACES IN THIS STRUCTURE AND WE ARE CREATING NEW SPACES BECAUSE THERE'S A DEMAND FOR THAT, WHAT BETTER GROUP OF EMPLOYEES TO KICK IS OUT TO A PARK AND RIDE LOT, WHERE THEY COULD TAKE A PARK AND RIDE AND USE A MOTOR POOL CAR IF THEY HAD TO RUN ON ERRAND AT LUNCH. I THOUGH THIS OUT THERE. THIS MAY NOT BE THE ONLY SOLUTION TO A PROBLEM, A LACK OF DOWNTOWN PARKING. FOR THAT ON ARE, I THINK WE SHOULD LOOK AT OTHER SOLUTIONS BETWEEN NOW AND SAY, JANUARY 6th, WHICH WAS THE MOVED POSTPONEMENT DATE AT THE VERY LEAST AND THAT'S WHY I'M SUPPORTING A POSTPONEMENT TONIGHT.
02:19:35.109: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE POSTPONEMENT? COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
02:19:40.081: >> Councilmember Bannister: THIS HAS BEEN A BIG ISSUE IN THE WARD 1, IN THE DOWNTOWN NEIGHBORHOODS BECAUSE THERE IS A BIG PARKING CRUNCH FOR THEM. AND THEY REALLY ARE SUFFERING AND THIS IS NOT EVEN WITH ALL THE THINGS IN THE PIPELINE THAT ARE COMING. SO I WOULD -- THEY WOULD LIKE THIS PARKING STRUCTURE, A LOT OF WARD ONE RESIDENTS WOULD LIKE THESE EXTRA 375. I WOULD BE -- I'M CONSIDERING THIS POSTPONEMENT IF WE -- TO FOLLOW ON COUNCILMEMBER GRAND'S IDEA THAT WE WOULD WORK ON THIS PART DURING POSTPONEMENT AND THE LAUNDRY LIST OF THINGS THAT WE WOULD BE WORKING ON WOULD BE TO, LIKE, INCREASE THE PARKING FINES, SUBSTANTIALLY IF YOU PARK ILLEGALLY IN A RESIDENTIAL PARKING PERMIT AREA. RIGHT NOW, IT'S ONLY $25, WHICH CAN ACTUALLY GIVE YOU TWO DAYS OF PARKING IF YOU GET A TICKET, YOU CAN STAY THERE TWO DAYS WHICH IS CHEAPER THAN THE STRUCTURE. SO DRAMATICALLY DETER PARKING IN THE RESIDENTIAL PARKING PERMIT AREA WITH A HIGHER FINE. INCREASE THE ENFORCEMENTS AND THE TRAFFIC ENFORCEMENT. THE WAIT LISTS, I HAD ONE OF OUR PEOPLE WOULD TENDED CAUCUS LAST NIGHT HAD FOIAED THE WAIT LIST AND DISSECTED IT AND SAW MANY FLAWS ON THE WAIT LIST. THINGS LIKE THE DOUBLE COUNTING THAT'S BEEN MENTIONED. PEOPLE ON THE LIST SINCE 2010. AND THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON WHERE IT'S NOT FIRST COME, FIRST SERVE, THEN WHO ACTUALLY GETS A PARKING SPACE? SO THE WHOLE ISSUE OF CLEANING UP THE PERMITS, THE WAIT LIST AND THEN THE BIGGEST ONE OF ALL IS NEW DEVELOPMENT, JUST LIKE IT SHOULD HANDLE ITS OWN STORMWATER, IT SHOULD HANDLE ITS OWN PARKING. AND SO A BIG ONE ON PEOPLE'S LISTS, AND MINE TOO, WOULD BE TO -- THIS ZERO PARKING REQUIREMENT IN D1 AND D2 ZONES SHOULD BE REVOKED ALONG WITH THE APPROVAL OF THIS -- OF THIS EXTRA 375 PARKING SPACES.
02:22:10.197: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE BOTH PONEMENT? -- POSTPONEMENT? FOR MY PART -- OH, I'M SORRY. COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
02:22:17.238: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU. I THINK IN THE INTEREST OF THIS POSTPONEMENT IS STAFF AND DDA ARE GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET TO SIX VOTES BECAUSE I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT VOICES ASKING FOR DIFFERENT THINGS AND PRIORITIZING DIFFERENT THINGS. AND THAT'S GOING TO BE A CHALLENGE. AND SO I -- I ACTUALLY WANT TO TAKE A NOTE FROM COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI THAT I ACTUALLY DO WANT TO CONFLATE THESE CONVERSATIONS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE, THE PARKING AND THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING BECAUSE THE ONLY WAY THAT I SEE A BENEFIT TO THIS COMMUNITY AND ADDING THESE 370 PLUS SPACES IS IF IT IS TO ENABLE US AS LEADERS TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND I'M REALLY EXCITED FOR MY COLLEAGUES TO GET THIS REPORT USE THERE'S SO MUCH REAL OPPORTUNITY AT THE SURFACE PARKING LOT AT 4th AND KATHERINE, THE SURFACE PARKING LOT AT 404 ASHLEY AND THE SURFACE PARKING LOT AT KLEIN, THERE'S HUGE OPPORTUNITY FOR LOW-INCOME TAX CREDITS FOR -- FOR DDA PARTNERSHIP THAT JUST AS MUCH AS THIS IS THE CHEAPEST AND MOST ACCESSIBLE WAY TO INCREASE PARKING DOWNTOWN, THOSE THREE SITES ARE, YOU KNOW, SOME OF THE BEST OPPORTUNITIES TO CONSTRUCT NEW AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN OUR CITY AND I WOULD LOVE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE TO MAKE REAL HEADWAY ON THAT AND REALLY FOCUS OUR EFFORTS ON THAT INSTEAD OF CREATING AN IMPOSSIBLE LAUNDRY LIST THAT CAN HAPPEN FROM NOW UNTIL JANUARY AND REALLY FOCUS OUR EFFORTS ON WHAT WE ALL SEE AS OUR NUMBER ONE CRISIS IN OUR DOWNTOWN, WHICH IS THE LACK OF DIVERSITY AND THE NEED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING.
02:24:10.718: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION?
02:24:18.292: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  IF I CAN RESPOND.
02:24:21.128: >> Mayor Taylor: YOU ROLLED TWICE. FOR MY PART, UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE ARE ISSUES THAT FOLKS, YOU KNOW, REASONABLY WANTED TO ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT AS TO WAIT LIST AND SO FORTH, I WILL VOTE AGAINST POSTPONEMENT BECAUSE I SUPPORT THE PROJECT AS IS. THE WAIT LIST RATIONALE DOESN'T REALLY SING TO ME. THAT'S NOT PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR MY PERSPECTIVE AS TO THIS RESOLUTION. THE RESOLUTION IS AS COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN SAID IT FREES UP SPACE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSE. COUNCIL WILL ONE DAY RETIRE SURFACE PARKING LOT, WHICH ARE TERRIBLE USES OF LAND AND WE WILL REMOVE HUNDREDS OF SPACES FROM THE SYSTEM, AND THE REMOVAL OF THOSE SPACES WILL CAUSE HARD ACHE AMONG BUSINESSES -- HEARTACHE AMONG BUSINESSES AND RESIDENTS AND THEY WILL TELL US THAT THEY ARE UNHAPPY WITH THAT CHOICE. THAT'S HAPPENED TO ME WHEN I HAVE PROPOSED AFFORDABLE -- WHEN I HAVE TRIAL BALLOONED FORWARDABLE HOUSING ON SOME OF THESE -- AFFORDABLE HOUSING ON SOME OF THESE EXCITES THE ONLY WAY THAT WE OFFSET THIS, THE ONLY WAY THAT WE HAVE THE COLLECTIVE STOMACH TO ADDRESS THAT AND TO OVERCOME WHAT WILL BE OPPOSITION IS IF WE HAVE OFFSET THOSE SPACES WITH OTHER PARKING. I DON'T VIEW THIS AS BEING INCONSISTENT WITH OUR VALUES. THE -- YOU KNOW, THE PARKING SPACES CAN BE OCCUPIED BY VEHICLES THAT DO NOT HAVE INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINES. PEOPLE WILL BE DRIVING DOWNTOWN GOD WILLING AND THEY WILL NEED PLACES TO PARK. AND THEY WILL NEED MORE PLACES TO PARK IF WE USE SURFACE LOTS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING AS WE ABSOLUTELY SHOULD AND AS I BELIEVE WE WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO. GETTING THOSE SPACES ONLINE NOW WILL -- IT WILL, I THINK, BE -- AS WE HEAR FROM THE DDA, THE LEAST COSTLY, MOST EFFICIENT WAY TO MAKE OURSELVES READY TO HAVE THAT AFFORDABLE HOUSING INVESTMENT AND SO I WOULD SUPPORT IT FROM THE JUMP. AND SO THAT'S WHY I'M GOING TO RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THE POSTPONEMENT. FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE ON POSTPONEMENT STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD? ABSENT.
02:26:46.373: >> Councilmember Lumm: NO.
02:26:46.941: >> Councilmember Grand: NO.
02:26:47.541: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES.
02:26:50.344: >> Mayor Taylor: NO.

02:26:51.912: >> Councilmember Nelson:  NO.
02:26:53.814: >> Councilmember Smith: YES.
02:26:54.415: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES.
02:26:56.150: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES.
02:26:59.787: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES.
02:27:01.388: >> Clerk Beaudry: THE MOTION FAILS.
02:27:02.990: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN MOTION? COUNCIL MEMBER HAYNER?
02:27:09.163: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I SIMPLY CAN'T SUPPORT THIS FOR THE REASONS I SPOKE DURING OUR REQUESTS FOR POSTPONEMENT, AND FOR THE REASONS I MENTIONED LAST WEEK AT THE DDA WORK SESSION. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THIS IS THE BEST SOLUTION TO MANAGING OUR PARKING DEMAND IN CITY AND I DON'T THINK WE MADE THE RIGHT EFFORTS TO DO SO TO THIS POINT. WHEN I LOOK AT WOULD USING THESE STRUCTURES AND WHO IS TAKING THEM UP, AND HOW IT MESHES WITH OUR -- WE'RE JUST AT ODDS WITH OURSELF. WE TALK ABOUT D1 AND D2 DOWNTOWN ZONING NOT REQUIRING PARKING, WHICH LOOKS LIKE A WAY TO -- IT LOOKS LIKE THE BIGGEST RESULT FROM THAT DOWNTOWN ZONING WAS INCREASING THE TIF CAPTURE AND PROPPING UP PARKING DEMAND IN OUR SYSTEM. TWO BENEFITS FOR THE DDA. AND I JUST -- I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THIS MONEY SPENT BETTER AT PARK AND RIDE LOTS, WE WOULD GET TWICE AS MANY SPOTS IF THIS WAS ON THE OUTSIDE OF OUR COMMUNITY, BUILT IN A DIFFERENT METHOD, AND THESE CITY AND COUNTY EMPLOYEES COULD USE THAT, WHICH WOULD RELIEVE SPACES DOWNTOWN. WE COULD CHANGE OUR ZONING TO HAVE REASONABLE PARKING MAXIMUMS IN NEW DOWNTOWN STRUCTURES AND STOP SHIFTING THE BURDEN FOR PRIVATE DEVELOPMENTS FAILURE TO PROVIDE ZONING, FAILURE TO PROVIDE PARKING, WHICH OBVIOUSLY INCREASES DEMAND ON THE STRUCTURES. AND SO THERE'S JUST -- THERE'S -- THERE'S -- THE COST OUTWEIGHS THE BENEFITS FOR ME, DESPITE THE FACT THAT WE ARE TOLD THAT THE PARKING IN THE STRUCTURE ITSELF WILL PAY FOR THIS. AND I MEAN, I HAVE BOND ISSUANCE QUESTIONS. IT SAYS NOT TO EXCEED 10% AND IT'S ON THE BOOKS AT 3.5%, BUT WHO KNOWS WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN TWO YEARS AND NOBODY WILL WANT THOSE ISSUANCES AND WE MAY HAVE TO PAY $35 MILLION PROJECT, COST OVERRUNS, I DON'T LIKE IT. WE HAVE A LOT OF NEEDS IN THE CITY AND BUILDING PARKING SPACE IS NOT AT THE TOP OF MY LIST. I UNDERSTAND IT'S THE DDA'S MISSION TO PROMOTE PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT IN THE DOWNTOWN AND ONE OF THE WAYS TO DO THAT IS TO HAVE PARKING. BUT THAT'S -- THAT'S YESTERDAY THINKING FOR ME AND SO I CANNOT SUPPORT THIS.
02:29:43.984: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. YEAH, AGAIN, I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS TONIGHT. I'M NOT GOING STRESS WITH ALL DUE RESPECT ABOUT THE DDA'S ABILITY TO PAY OFF THIS. WE NEED TO REMEMBER THAT THE DDA'S PARKING FUND RESERVES ARE VERY HEALTHY. IT'S $11.8 MILLION AT YEAR END FISCAL YEAR '19, WHICH IS 5 OF THEIR ANNUAL ARE ENVIRONMENT KNEW. PARKING REVENUE IS VERY, VERY STABLE. AND THIRDLY THE DDA TIF REVENUE GROWTH IS ANOTHER SOURCE OF FINANCIAL GROWTH FOR THEM. THE TIF GREW FROM $3.7 MILLION IN '13 AND $7 MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR '20. ALMOST DOUBLE. AND THE DDA WILL PAY ALL THE COST AND THE DEBT SERVICE AND THE ISSUANCE COST. SO THEY ARE UP TO IT. THERE HAVE BEEN CONCERNS RAISED ABOUT HOW EXPENSIVE IT IS TO BUILD PARKING CAPACITY. NO ONE IS ARGUING IT'S NOT. HOWEVER, I WOULD JUST PUT FORTH THAT THE COST OF THE COMMUNITY NOT SUSTAINING A HEALTHY -- A HEALTHY ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND GROWTH DOWNTOWN FAR EXSOLDIERSOS $20 MILLION. THIS IS THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS. AND THE DDA HAS POINTED OUT CORRECTLY THIS WAS SUPPORTED BY WHAT WE HAVE HEARD ABOUT HOW THESE SURFACE LOTS ARE NOW BEING VIEWED, THAT FUTURE -- IN ADDITION TO THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT IN DOWNTOWN, ELIMINATING THE CAPACITY IN SURFACE LOTS, I MEAN, IT DOES SUPPORT THE ARGUMENT THAT THIS IS -- THIS IS REALLY JUST TO MAINTAIN THE SYSTEM. AND THAT IT'S EVEN MORE ACCURATE IF THE DESIRE IS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND IF THAT DESIRE IS REALIZED DOWNTOWN. LASTLY, I WOULD POINT TO THE INFORMATIVE EMAIL FROM THE OLD FOURTH WARD NEIGHBORS REGARDING THE PARKING SITUATION NEAR DOWNTOWN. OBVIOUSLY, IT'S VERY CHALLENGING NOW. IT'S LIKELY TO GET WORSE. WE ARE HEARING MORE AND MORE FROM PEOPLE WHO RECENTLY MOVED ONTOWN, SHARING -- DOWNTOWN, SHARING HOW DIFFICULTY IT IS TO FIND ON-STREET PARKING. SO THE POINT IS WE HAVE A SYSTEM NOW THAT'S AT CAPACITY, BOTH IN DOWNTOWN AND NEAR DOWNTOWN. AND I JUST THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, THERE'S NOTHING TO PROHIBIT US FROM -- FROM SUPPORTING THIS, AND THEN WORKING ON THESE OTHER ISSUES THAT WE SHOULD BE AWORKING ON, THE ZONING ISSUES AND OTHER ISSUES, AND WE SHOULD GET PARK AND RIDES OUTSIDE OF TOWN. WE DON'T REALLY HAVE CONTROL OVER THAT THE WAY WE WOULD LIKE TO. SO OBVIOUSLY, I'M HOPING THAT MY LEAGUES WILL SUPPORT THIS -- LEAGUES WILL SUPPORT THIS.
02:33:02.149: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. WELL, I'M DISAPPOINTED IN MY COLLEAGUES FOR NOT JOINING MY CALL TO POSTPONE THIS. IT'S REALLY UNFORTUNATE. I DON'T ASK FOR TOO MUCH OF MY COLLEAGUES, BUT FOR TWO MONTHS. I WAS ELECTED ON REFORM. WE CAN CONTINUE WITH DDA REFORM, AND THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO HERE. AND APPARENTLY WE'RE NOT ALL IN CONCERT WITH THAT. I ASKED FOR A COUPLE OF THINGS TO BE FIXED. I MEAN THE OLD FOURTH WARD IS 1.5 MILES AWAY FROM THIS. YOU MIGHT AS WELL BE TALKING ABOUT BURNS PARK. I MEAN, IT'S JUST -- AND THEN TO ALSO -- YOU KNOW, IT'S AMAZING THAT WE CAN TALK ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THIS ARGUMENT. IF YOU WANT AFFORDABLE HOUSING, BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING! NOT PARKING GARAGES. SO IT'S JUST -- IT'S JUST FOR ME, IT'S HARD FOR ME TO ACCEPT. AND HARD FOR ME TO LOOK PEOPLE IN THE EYE TO SAY WE ARE BUILDING 375 PARKING SPACES FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WHERE IS THE LOGIC IN THAT? I'M SORRY. I'M NOT BUYING IT. I KNOW WE ARE STUDYING THESE OTHER LOTS AND WE ARE STUDYING THESE OTHER PROPERTIES, BUT WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN THE RESULTS OUT OF THEM. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT YET AND TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, I THOUGHT ALL EYES WERE ON THE Y LOT. THAT'S WHERE MY ATTENTION IS. IT SHOULD BE ON THE LOT. WE JUST SPENT $75,000 IT STUDY IT AND IT'S GOOD TO DO OUR DUE DILIGENCE AND LOOK AT OTHER PROPERTIES. BUT IF WE WANT AFFORDABLE HOUSING, LET'S QUIT TALKING ABOUT PARKING, WHETHER IT'S CORE OR WHETHER IT'S THIS AND JUST KNOW THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THERE IS NOTHING IN THE PIPELINE WITH THESE SURFACE LOTS, THE SURFACE LOTS HAVE BEEN SURFACE LOTS SINCE I GOT TO TOWN IN 1987. GUESS WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN 35 YEARS. NOTHING! SO, YOU KNOW, I JUST -- IT'S JUST DISAPPOINTING THAT I DON'T GET THE POSTPONE TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS I HAVE WITH THE WAIT LISTS, AND HAVING 2020 TECHNOLOGY WITH THOSE, AND DON'T SOCIALIZE THE RISK AND PRIVATIZE THE PROFITS. THAT'S WHAT THIS IS. I MEAN, IT'S CORPORATE WELFARE. AT THE GOVERNMENT LEVEL. AND, YOU KNOW, I KNOLL THERE'S SOME OTHER -- I KNOW THERE'S SOME OTHER ISSUES WHETHER IT'S TRAFFIC OR CLIMATE OR OTHER ISSUES BUT THESE ARE BASIC CORE PRINCIPLES THAT I FIND I NEED TO ADDRESS. SOMEONE NEEDS TO BRING THIS UP. WE ARE SOCIALIZING THE RISK, PRIVATIZING THE PROFITS.
02:36:09.803: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
02:36:10.704: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I'M ALSO DISAPPOINTED THAT WE DIDN'T POSTPONE. I THINK I WAS A VOTE THAT WANTED TO BE A YES BUT AT THIS POINT CAN'T. LIKE I SAID EARLIER, THE ONE COMPELLING CASE TO ME FOR THIS EXPANSION WOULD BE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING ON LOTS WITHOUT CREATING A DETRIMENTAL SITUATION FOR BUSINESS OWNERS DOWNTOWN AND I THINK WE HAVE TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS TOGETHER. I THINK THAT'S ONE CONVERSATION. IT CAN'T BE TWO BECAUSE DOWN THE ROAD, LET'S SAY WE BUILD THIS 370 PLUS PARKING SPACES AND BY THE TIME WE GET AROUND TO THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING SOMETIME NEXT YEAR, HOPEFULLY, EVEN THAT WON'T BE ENOUGH. WE HAVE TO BE SHOWING THE CONNECTION IN OUR COMMUNICATIONS TO THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY IN THE DOWNTOWN COMMUNITY. AND I JUST -- IT'S HARD. I WANT TO CREATE THE OPPORTUNITY, BUT I WANT THE SURFACE LOTS TO BE USED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. I CAN'T VOTE YES TONIGHT.
02:37:41.328: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND?
02:37:43.129: >> Councilmember Grand: I WANT TO RESPOND TO WHY I DIDN'T THINK POSTPONING TWO MONTHS WAS A GOOD IDEA. I JUST DIDN'T THINK THAT IT WAS REALISTIC TO GET THAT MUCH DONE IN SUCH A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME AS, -- YOU KNOW, FOR THOSE OF WHITE HOUSE S -- OF US WHO SAT HERE, WE KNOW THAT GOVERNMENT MOVES SLOWLY AND IT WAS NOT CLEAR WHAT THE ASK WAS ON WHAT WE WILL GET DONE IN TWO MONTHS. IT WASN'T THAT WE WANTED TO HAVE TIME FOR DISCUSSION. I THINK WE HEARD A LOT OF GOOD IDEAS. I THINK I'M COMPLETELY IN FAVOR OF LOOKING AT SOME OF THE IDEAS THAT COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER BROUGHT UP, FOR EXAMPLE, ABOUT HOW WE -- ABOUT HOW WE STRUCTURE FEES AND HOW WE CHANGE WAIT LISTS BUT I DON'T THINK THE ZONING ISSUE -- JUST KNOWING HOW LONG THE ZONING TAKES TO GET DONE AND KNOWING, YOU KNOW, THE RESPONSES THAT I HEARD FROM PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY THAT WHEN WE MAKE ZONING CHANGES, PARTICULARLY WITH THE MASTER PLAN ON THE HORIZON AND HOW CAN YOU BE SUGGESTING SOMETHING LIKE T1 ZONING, FOR EXAMPLE AND WHAT SEEMS LIKE FOREVER TO ME. SO A LOT OF THESE ISSUES ARE CONFLATED TO ME, BECAUSE I HAVE LIVED THROUGH A LOT OF HOW PEOPLE HAVE MADE THE CONNECTIONS AND I JUST DON'T REALISTICALLY SEE HOW HAVING -- HOW WE WILL MAKE A ZONING CHANGE ABOUT DOWNTOWN PARKING THAT I PERSONALLY DON'T THINK IS A GOOD REIDEA TO HAVE D1 BUILDINGS CREE THEIR OWN PARKING. THAT'S A HORRIBLE IDEA. IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DO WITHOUT A LOT OF COMMUNITY CONVERSATION AND INPUT. SO TO ME, THAT'S NOT JANUARY. AND THAT'S WHY I DIDN'T SUPPORT IT. IT WAS DEFINITELY NOT DUE TO A LACK OF RESPECT FOR THE REQUEST.
02:39:34.074: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
02:39:41.881: >> Councilmember Bannister: I'M GOING TO HAVE TO VOTE YES OPEN THIS PARKING STRUCTURE, BECAUSE -- ON THIS PARKING STRUCTURE BECAUSE I KNOW THAT'S WHAT THE WARD 1 IMMEDIATE NEIGHBORS ARE WANTING ME TO DO. BUT I WANT TO SAY THAT I AM VERY, VERY UPSET TO HAVE TO DO IT. I DO FEEL THAT I AGREE WITH MANY OF THESE COMMENTS AROUND THE TABLE ABOUT CORPORATE WELFARE AND THAT THIS ZERO PARKING FOR DOWNTOWN PEOPLE -- THE DOWNTOWN DEVELOPMENTS IS UNACCEPTABLE. SO I'M GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THOSE, ON THOSE ZONING CHANGES AND TRY TO GET -- THERE'S SEVERAL VULNERABILITIES IN OUR ZONING THAT WE DON'T WANT TO WAIT UNTIL THE MASTER PLANNING PROCESS. WE HAVE TO LOOK AT SEVERAL OF OUR ZONING CATEGORIES AND THIS IS ONE EVER THEM. THIS ZERO PARKING REQUIREMENT IN D1 AND D2 IS JUST A RECIPE FOR SOCIALIZING THE PARKING TROUBLE. SO I'M GOING TO VOTE YES ON IT, BUT I'M GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK HARD ON MAKING DEVELOPMENT PAY FOR ITS OWN STORMWATER AND PAY FOR ITS OWN PARKING, AND NOT EXTERNALIZE THEIR COSTS ON TO THE REST OF US. THANKS.
02:40:58.091: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.

02:41:27.821: >> Mayor Taylor: DO WE HAVE COMMUNICATIONS TODAY FROM OUR CITY ATTORNEY?
02:41:30.256: >> City Atty. Postema: NO, MAYOR.
02:41:32.192: >> Mayor Taylor: WE HAVE BEFORE US THE CLERK'S REPORT OF COMMUNICATIONS, PETITIONS AND REFERRALS. MAY I HAVE A MOTION TO APPROVE THE CLERK'S REPORT. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, AND SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER SMITH. DISCUSSION OF THE CLERK'S REPORT? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? THE CLERK'S REPORT IS APPROVED. WE NOW COME TO PUBLIC COMMENT GENERAL TIME. IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO SPEAK TO COUNCIL AND THE COMMUNITY ABOUT MATTERS OF MUNICIPAL INTEREST. TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT GENERAL TIME, ONE NEED NOT SIGN UP IN ADVANCE. SPEAKERS HAVE THREE MINUTES IN WHICH TO SPEAK. SO PLEASE PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE CLIMB CLOCK. AS A MATTER OF THE COURTESY, WE MAY ONLY HAVE ONE PERSON SPEAKING AT A TIME AND IF YOU REQUIRE ASSISTANCE IN SPEAKING BEFORE COUNCIL TODAY, WE WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO PROVIDE IT TO YOU. IS THERE ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT?
02:42:18.238: >> MY NAME IS ED VILLAMETI. I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS COUNCIL AND THE MAYOR, REGARDING PLANNING FOR N. YEAR'S BUDGET, SPECIFICALLY THE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PLAN, VERY SPECIFICALLY THE SIDEWALK GAP PIECE OF THAT PLAN. THERE WILL HOPEFULLY BE SUFFICIENT FUNDING IN THE BUDGE TOTE ADDRESS SOME OF THE MORE EGREGIOUS NEEDS IN OUR SIDEWALK NETWORK. THINGSWHICH HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY REFERRED TO AS GOAT PATHS, WHICH I THINK IS A TERM THAT SHOULD BE RETIRED FROM USE IN FAVOR OF THE NOTION THAT THESE ARE DESIRE LINES WHERE PEOPLE WANT TO WALK AND WILL WALK AND EVEN IN CASES WHERE THE MUNICIPALITY HAS NOT PROVIDED THEM ANY AFFORDANCES FOR WALKING. THE ISSUE IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD IS THE SIMPSON STREET, AND THIS HAS GONE BACK TO THE STATE STREET PLANNING PROCESS WHERE THERE'S A GAP BETWEEN IN FRONT OF RELATIVELY LOW-INCOME HOUSING BETWEEN THE UNIVERSITY AND THE NEIGHBORHOODS THERE. IT'S A GAP WHICH HAS A DEEP RUT IN THE -- IN THE STREET. IT'S I GAP NEAR SEVERAL BUSY -- NEAR SEVERAL BUSY BUS STOPS. AND THE WAY THE CITY CURRENTLY HANDLES SIDEWALK GAPS IS TO ASSUME THAT THEY SHOULD BE HANDLED BY ASSESSING THE NEARBY PROPERTY OWNERS, WHICH CERTAINLY WILL BRING UP SOME CONCERN THAT THE -- THAT AN UNFAIR ASSESSMENT. AND I WOULD SIMPLY PONT OUT THAT THE NEEDS AFTER DRESSING THESE GAPSGAPS ACCRUED BENEFITS ACROSE CITY, ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO MINIMIZE THE BURDEN ON ANY INDIVIDUAL PARCEL OWNER FOR NOT HAVING A SIDEWALK ON THEIR LAP, ESPECIALLY LONG AFTER THEIR PARCEL WAS ANNEXED FROM THE TOWNSHIP, MIGHT BE A NICE THING TO DO, BUT IT'S MUCH MONTH ARE IMPORTANT TO ADDRESS THE GAPS THEMSELVES AND MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO WALK IN THE MUD TO GET TO THE BUS. SO THANKS VERY MUCH.
02:44:47.086: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
02:44:57.664: >> HELLO, ADAM OXNER. I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI'S WANTING TO SEPARATE PARKING FROM AFFORDABLE HOUSING DISCUSSIONS BUT I THINK THEY ARE NECESSARILY ENTWINED AND IT'S ACCOMPLI INDICATED ISSUE. SO -- COMPLICATED ISSUE AND SO IT CAN BE -- IT'S NOT LIKE BUILDING PARKING WILL BE THE ONLY FACTOR IN THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUT THE ZONING ORDINANCES THAT REQUIRE PARKING DOWNTOWN DO INCREASE THE PRICING OF THE DOWNTOWN -- OR THE DEVELOPMENTS DOWNTOWN, WHICH WOULD WORK IN OPPOSITION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND IN GENERAL, AND THERE'S A LOT OF CONNECTION BETWEEN PARKING AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING BECAUSE IT IS A LAND USE ISSUE. SO I THINK THAT TO TOTALLY DISMISS IT FROM THE DISCUSSION WAS -- IS MAYBE NOT ADVISED IN THE FUTURE DISCUSSIONS OF PARKING, ALTHOUGH, ITS WEIGHT IN DISCUSSION CAN BE ARGUED, BUT IT IS IMPORTANT TO THE DISCUSSION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THAT'S IT. THANK YOU.
