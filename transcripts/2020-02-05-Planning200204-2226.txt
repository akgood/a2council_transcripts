00:00:26.927: >> Chair Milshteyn: THTHANK YOU. DO WE HAVE ANY INTRODUCTIONS?
00:00:33.033: >> WE DO NOT.
00:00:33.900: >> Chair Milshteyn: DO WE HAVE A COMMISSIONER THAT WILL MOVE THE AGENDA MOVED BY GIBB RANDALL AND SECONDED BY MILLS. ALL THOSE IN FAVOR PLEASE SAY AYE. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. MINUTES OF PREVIOUS MEETING. BEFORE US, WE HAVE THE JANUARY 22nd, 2020, MEETING MINUTES. DO I HAVE A COMMISSIONER THAT WILL MOVE. MOVE BY COMMISSIONER ABRAMS AND SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER GIBB RANDALL. ALL THOSE IN FAVOR PLEASE SAY AYE. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. NOW WE COME TO REPORTS FROM CITY ADMINISTRATION.

00:01:16.877: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR. ONE UPDATE FROM THE MEETING LAST NIGHT. 2260 TRAVER ROAD, A SINGLE FAMILY PARCEL OF 3.5 ACRES WAS ANNEXED INTO THE CITY.
00:01:31.258: >> Chair Milshteyn: DO WE HAVE A REPORT FROM THE PLANNING MANAGER?
00:01:34.061: >> WE DO NOT.
00:01:38.031: >> Chair Milshteyn: PLANNING COMMISSION OFFICERS AND COMMITTEES. COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL.
00:01:41.501: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: I THINK WE TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE, THAT ON FEBRUARY 22nd, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE OUR BIG KIND OF CLIMATE SUMMIT, FOR THE CITY AND THAT THIS IS A CHANCE FOR PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO HEAR ABOUT THE POTENTIAL STRATEGIES USED FOR ACHIEVING CARBON NEUTRALITY. I THINK IT'S NOON TO FIVE. IT'S A CHANCE FOR PEOPLE TO WEIGH IN ON WHICH STRATEGIES THEY LIKE, THAT WILL BE KIND OF A SERIES OF TED TALK-STYLE PRESENTATIONS. AND IT'S A REAL OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO INFLUENCE THE DIRECTION OF WHAT WE MAY SEE AS WE TRY TO MEET OUR VERY AMBITIOUS CLIMATE GOALS.
00:02:30.784: >> Chair Milshteyn: GREAT. ANY OTHER REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES? COMMISSIONER MILLS?
00:02:37.958: >> Vice Chair Mills: I JUST THOUGHT I WOULD REPORT THAT THE O.R.C. DID MEET LAST WEEK AND WE DISCUSSED TWO ITEMS OF BUSINESS. ONE WAS ALLOWING SOLAR ENERGY ON CARPORTS AND WHAT THAT MIGHT LOOK LIKE. I THINK THAT'S CLOSE. AND THEN THE OTHER THING THAT WE DID WAS STARTED A DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT SORT OF BENEFITS COUNT IN OUR PLANNED PROJECT -- TOWARDS PLANNED PROJECT MODIFICATIONS. AND SO THAT'S ONE THAT I THINK THE O.R.C. WILL BE TALKING ABOUT A LITTLE BIT MORE BEFORE IT COMES TO A WORKING SESSION OR IT MIGHT COME TO A WORKING SESSION FIRST. THAT ONE, KIND OF GOING THROUGH THE LIST AND FIGURING OUT WHAT WE WANT TO PULL OFF AND WHAT WE WANT TO PULL ON IS -- WAS ON THE AGENDA.
00:03:25.138: >> Chair Milshteyn: ANY OTHER REPORTS FROM ANY COMMITTEES? VARIOUS CORRESPONDENCES TO THE CITY PLANNING COMMISSION. WE HAVE ACTUALLY QUITE A BIT THAT WE RECEIVED IN THE LAST -- SINCE FRIDAY. SO PLEASE TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. WE NOW MOVE ON TO AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION. THIS IS A TIME FOR ANY MEMBER OF THE AUDIENCE TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION IN REGARDS TO ANY ITEM NOT ON THE AGENDA. IF YOU HAVE AN ITEM THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO DISCAUSE THAT'S NOT ON THE AJEN -- DISCUSS THAT'S NOT ON THE AGENDA, PLEASE STEP UP TO THE PODIUM AND STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS FOR THE RECORD AND YOU HAVE UP TO THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
00:04:01.374: >> I HAD THERE. NOAH HOFFMAN, 1760 NORTH BRIDGE DRIVE. I SPOKE TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO, AND I'M COMING HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE PROPOSED ORDINANCE TO REGULATE SHORT-TERM RENTALS. I WANT TO GIVEN A LITTLE BIT OF AN OUTLINE AND I THINK LAST TIME I SPOKE -- AND I APOLOGIZE -- THERE WASN'T A WHOLE LOT OF CONTEXT FOR WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT AND I WANT TO GIVE A LITTLE OVERVIEW AS BEST I CAN. TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE, BACK IN MID-20 19, THERE WAS ONE CONSTITUENT IN  IN ANN ARBOR WHD A BAD EXPERIENCE. SHE LIVED NEXT TO SOMEONE WHO DECIDED TO RENT HER HOUSE ON A SHORT-TERM RENTAL SITE. THERE WAS AN ISSUE AND SHE TOOK IT UPON HERSELF TO CREATE A MOVEMENT, WHICH WE ARE NOT REALLY SURE THAT IT HAS MUCH BACKING, BUT SHE STARTED BAN A2BNB AND THERE WAS SO MUCH BACKFLASH AGAINST IT AND SHE CHANGED IT TO LEGISLATE AIRBNB. THAT WAS A COMMON TREND THAT WE FOUND. THE NEXT STEP WAS SHE LOBBIED THE CITY COUNCIL. SHE DECIDED TO GO TO DEREK DELACOURT AND OTHER CITY COUNCILMEMBERS, CALLING AND CALLING AND CALLING AND ASKING FOR THEM TO DO SOMETHING. FINALLY, THEY DECIDED TO HIRE CARLISLE WARTMAN AND ASSOCIATES, AND PUT OUT  A MEMO AFTER THREE PUBLIC MEETINGS. THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY WAS THE NUMBERS WERE 50%, 25% AND 15% IN THE FOLLOWING ORDER OF DO NOTHING. SO DON'T REGULATE. DO VERY LITTLE. SO INCLUDE PERMITS AND INSPECTIONS OR DO A LOT, WHICH IS SPECIFICALLY BANNING THE SHORT-TERM RENTALS THAT ARE NOT SOMEONE'S PRIMARY RESIDENCE, RIGHT? SO 15%, ROUGHLY, IS WHO SUPPORTED THAT IDEA. THEREAFTER, THE CITY COUNCIL IN NOVEMBER RECEIVED A MEMO FROM CARLISLE WARTMAN, WHICH IN OUR ESTIMATION GROSSLY MISCHARACTERIZED THE SITUATION OF SHORT-TERM RENTALS IN THE COUNTRY. ONE SPECIFIC DATA POINT THEY SAID FOUR OR FIVE REPRESENTATIVE CITIES, SO 80% OF THE CITIES IN THE COUNTRY, BAN NON-PRIMARY RESIDENTIAL SHORT-TERM RENTALS. THAT'S NOT TRUE. IF YOU LOOK AT ANN ARBOR, AND ROYAL OAK, COLUMBUS, OHIO, THOSE ARE GOOD EXAMPLES THAT THEY DECIDED NOT TO INCLUDE. THOSE ONES EXPLICITLY ALLOW IT. THEY HAVE A GREAT PERMITTING PROCESS. IT'S VERY SAFE AND ABOVE BOARD AND THEY HAVE DECIDED NOT TO INCLUDE IT. FINALLY CITY COUNCIL DECIDED TO PASS A RESOLUTION IN EARLY JANUARY, THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR THE FRAMEWORK OF AN ORDINANCE THAT WAS BASED AROUND BANNING THE SHORT-TERM RENTALS AND AS SOMEBODY WHO HAS BEEN DOING IT FOLLOWING ALL THE RULES FOR THE BETTER PART OF A YEAR AND A HALF, I'M A LITTLE BIT CONFUSED ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED. AND I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND WHY THEY ARE MOVING INTO THIS DIRECTION, BECAUSE ZONING IS A PART OF THIS, I COME BEFORE YOU TO ASK AND JUST KIND OF EXPLAIN THIS PROCESS. THANK YOU.
00:07:08.928: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU.
00:07:17.904: >> I'M JEFF HUGH. 111 NORTH ASHLEY STREET. SO I ACTUALLY KIND OF WANTED TO TALK ABOUT THE SAME ISSUE, BUT KIND OF FROM A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE. I'M A RESIDENT PHYSICIAN AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN. I JUST WANTED TO TAKE A COUPLE OF MINUTES TO TALK ABOUT THE SHORT-TERM RENTAL ISSUE AND HOW IT CAN AFFECT US AS A MEDICAL COMMUNITY BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY HOW IT AFFECTS OUR PATIENTS THAT WE HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF TAKING CARE OF. WHEN I STARTED MEDICAL RESIDENCY THIS PAST YEAR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, I WAS TOTALLY NEW TO THE AREA, DIDN'T HAVE A PLACE TO LIVE. LIKE MANY OF MY FELLOW RESIDENTS I WAS MOVING ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND WAS UNABLE TO VISIT APARTMENTS UNTIL I MOVED HERE A FEW WEEKS BEFORE WE STARTED WORK. SO DURING THAT -- DURING THE TIME WHEN I MOVED HERE, THE FIRST COUPLE OF WEEKS MY FAMILY AND I STAYED IN AN AIRBNB AND DURING THAT TIME FOUND A PERMANENT RESIDENCE. ANOTHER WAY THE SHORT-TERM RENTALS IMPACT OUR COMMUNITY IS DURING MEDICAL STUDENT AWAY ROTATIONS. EVERY YEAR, A LARGE NUMBER OF FOURTH YEAR MEDICAL STUDENTS COME TO ANN ARBOR FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO DO TWO TO FOUR WEEK AWAY ROTATIONS WHICH ARE ESSENTIALLY ADDITIONS WITH DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS AT OUR HOSPITAL. IN MY EXPERIENCE, THE MAJORY IN OF THESE STUDENTS WHO DON'T HAVE A FRIEND TO STAY WITH IN THE AREA, DON'T KNOW ANYBODY IN THE AREA APPRECIATE THE CONVENIENCE OF RENTING AN AIRBNB, BECAUSE THEY WILL BE WORKING PRETTY LONG HOURS FOR SEVERAL WEEKS. WITH REGARD TO THE PARTIES THE UNIVERSITY OF -- PATIENTS, UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN IS A TERTIARY CARE CENTER AND SERVES PEOPLE FROM MICHIGAN AND OHIO. I TREAT PEOPLE EVERY DAY WHO COME FROM HOURS AWAY TO GET TREATMENT FROM THOSE WHO ARE EXPERTS IN THEIR FIELD. MANY FAMILIES USE AIRBNBs AS THEY COME FROM FAR AWAY CITIES AND THEY ARE HERE FOR LIFE CHANGING PROCEDURES AND MAJOR SURGERIES. THEY MENTIONED THAT THEY APPRECIATE THE PRIVACY, AS OPPOSED TO STAYING IN A HOTEL, WHEN THEY ARE UNDERGOING SOMETHING THAT COULD CHANGE THEIR LIVES. I JUST WANTED TO THANK YOU GUYS FOR TAKING THE TIME TO LISTEN AND HOPE THAT YOU CONSIDER THE REPERCUSSIONS OF POTENTIALLY BANNING AIRBNBs IN THE CITY. THANK YOU.
00:09:40.713: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU.
00:09:47.754: >> HI, THANKS FOR HEARING ME AGAIN. I'M CAROL SCALA AND I LIVE AT -- WELL, OUR HOME IS AT 1524 MARION. I JUST WANTED TO ASK YOU GUYS TO FAST FORWARD A LITTLE BIT IN YOUR THOUGHT PROCESS. I KNOW OR I THINK THAT YOU HAVEN'T PROBABLY RECEIVED ANY WRITTEN DOCUMENTS FROM CITY STAFF ON THIS, SO YOU HAVE NO FRAMEWORK TO, YOU KNOW, REALLY START CONSIDERING WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO DO BUT I THINK IT'S GOING TO COME AND IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO COME AS WAS RECOMMENDED BY COUNCIL AND I WOULD ASK YOU TO CONSIDER A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT I THINK WE REALLY HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT TOO MUCH AND ONE IS ENFORCEMENT. WELL, IF THEY REQUIRE AND REQUEST A TOTAL BAN ON NONOWNER OCCUPIED AIRBNBs, IT WILL BE REALLY DIFFICULT FOR THE CITY TO ENFORCE THIS. I DON'T EVEN KNOW, YOU KNOW -- YOU WOULD NEED A REGISTRATION SYSTEM OF SOME SORT AND THEN YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO HIRE SOMEBODY TO ACTUALLY TRACK THE AIRBNBs AND FIND OUT ABOUT THE ONES THAT AREN'T REGISTERED AND THEN WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WITH THEM. I DON'T -- IT'S GOING TO GET REALLY COMPLICATED AND THE OTHER ISSUE IS ZONING. I MEAN, WILL WE END UP HAVING TO REZONE ANN ARBOR BECAUSE WE HAVE GOT STUDENT RENTALS AND LONG-TERM RENTALS MIXED IN WITH SHORT-TERM RENTALS IN RESIDENTIAL AREAS WHERE PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT THEY SHOULDN'T BE? SO IT'S REALLY COMPLICATED AND I DON'T THINK IT NEEDS TO BE THIS COMPLICATED. I THINK THAT THERE ARE CITIES WHO ALREADY HAVE DONE THE HOMEWORK FOR ANN ARBOR, CITIES LIKE COLUMBUS, DUBLIN, OHIO DID AN EXTENSIVE REVIEW. I JUST EMAILS ALEX THIS EVENING, A COPY OF THEIR REPORT, AND THEY HAVE OPTED VIRTUALLY TO DO NOTHING BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T REALLY IDENTIFY A PROBLEM. AND SO I THINK THAT THERE WAS SOME WORK THAT NEEDED TO BE DONE BY COUNCIL, NOT BY THE CONSULTING FIRM, ALTHOUGH, THE CONSULTANTS WERE HIRED TO DO THIS WORK BUT WE DIDN'T GET A VERY GOOD REPORT. THE WORK SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE BEFORE IT CAME TO YOU, BEFORE IT WENT BACK TO CITY STAFF, TO DRAFT SOMETHING. PEOPLE WERE NOT LOOKING AT THE CITIES WHO HAVE SUCCESSFULLY COME UP WITH A REASONABLE PLAN THAT BENEFITED BOTH SIDES OF THIS ISSUE. THE MAYOR OF COLUMBUS ACTUALLY SAID THAT IT WAS INCUMBENT UPON THE CITY TO BALANCE THE BENEFIT OF SHORT-TERM RENTALS AGAINST PUBLIC SAFETY, THAT THAT WAS THE ONLY THING THAT THEY WERE CONSIDERING WAS PUBLIC SAFETY AND WE HAVE ORDINANCES IN PLACE AND LAWS IN THE CITY TO DEAL WITH PUBLIC SAFETY AND THERE HAS BEEN NO PROOF THROUGH THE POLICE DEPARTMENT THAT SHORT-TERM RENTALS ARE A PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUE IN THIS CITY. SO I JUST THINK THAT WE NEED TO BE LOOKING AT SOME OF THE EXAMPLES OF THE CITIES WHO HAVE DONE IT AND ARE DOING IT WELL. AS -- THANK YOU.
00:13:09.422: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU.
00:13:19.599: >> GOOD EVENING, I'M TOM STALLBERG, A LOWER TOWN RESIDENT. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU ARE ALL AWARE, WE ARE JUST NOW SETTLING A LAWSUIT, RESOLVING THE LAWSUIT AGAINST THE CITY FOR IMPROPERLY REZONING LOWER TOWN TO A CAMPUS BUSINESS DISTRICT CATEGORY. SO WHERE IS THE CAMPUS BUSINESS DISTRICT? HOW IS IT DEFINED? HOW CAN IT GROW OR MIGRATE? AND WHO GETS TO DECIDE THAT? IF THE U OF M BUYS MORE PROPERTY, LIKE FINGERLY, DOES THAT INSTANTLY CHANGE THE BOUNDARIES OF CAMPUS AND IN TURN OUR ZONING BOUNDARIES? IF THE U OF M RENTS A CLUSTER OF BUILDINGS IS THAT CAMPUS -- WHAT ABOUT NORTH CAMPUS? WHAT ABOUT THE ARGUS CAMPUS, DOES THAT U OF M CAMPUS, ALLOW ZONING FOR 415 WEST WASHINGTON. HOW CLOSE DO YOU HAVE TO BE TO BE NEAR CAMPUS? DOES THIS MEAN THE U OF M CONTROLS THE BOUNDARIES OF OUR ZONING DISTRICTS? CAN SOMEONE ELSE HAVE A COUPLE PUS LIKE WHEN WE HAD COOLEY LAW SCHOOL ON PLYMOUTH ROAD? WHAT HAPPENS TO OUR ZONING BOUNDARIES WHEN THAT CAMPUS CLOSES? SO THE ANSWER IS VERY SIMPLE, NONE OF THAT MATTERS. THE BOUNDARIES FOR CAMPUS BUSINESS DISTRICT ARE NOT DEFINED FROM A RADIUS OF A SINGLE BUILDING OR CLUSTER OF BUILD, IT'S NOT NORTH CAMPUS OR THE MEDICAL CENTER AND ESPECIALLY NOT A SATELLITE BUILDING THAT'S NOT PART OF THE MEDICAL CENTER. IT'S NOT DEFINED BY ANY -- BY THE U OF M IN ANY WAY WITHOUT INPUT FROM THE CITY. WE MAKE OUR LAWS. SO THE CAMPUS BUSINESS DISTRICT, WHAT IS IT? IT'S THE GOWN PART OF OUR TOWN AND GOWN DOWNTOWN URBAN CORE AREA. THE PLANNING DOCUMENTS SAY THAT IT IT'S ESSENTIALLY ALONG THE SOUTH UNIVERSITY AVENUE ALONG WITH STREETS IMMEDIATELY ABUTTING THAT TO THE SOUTH AND THE STATE AND PACKARD INTERSECTION. IT IS NOT ANYTHING SIMPLY CALLED CAMPUS. IT'S THE CAMPUS BUSINESS DISTRICT. AND IT DIDN'T MERELY DEFINED BY PHYSICAL LOCATION, BUT ALSO BY CHARACTER. URBAN CORE ZONING CATEGORIES HAVE REQUIREMENTS AND STANDARDS PARTICULAR TO THE CHARACTER OF AN URBAN CORE. PICTURE EITH EITHER THE TOWN OR, LIKE THE SMALL FRONT SETBACKS AND ZERO SIDE YARD SETBACKS, BUT THEY DON'T MAKE SENSE IN A NEIGHBORHOOD. URBAN CORE CHARACTERISTICS USUALLY INCLUDE THINGS LIKE TALLER HEIGHTS AND GREATER DENSITY AND LESS PARKING AND MORE FLEXIBILITY AND MIXED USE. SO YOU PICTURE THE HERD OF UNIVERSITY STUDENTS GOING TO CLASS AND FINDING A PLACE TO EAT OR DRINK. OUR PLANNING DOCUMENTS AND ZONING CODE SUPPORT SUCH AN URBAN CORD AND WE DIFFERENTIATED OUR TOWN AND GOWN URBAN CORES. C1A AND C1R ARE CORE ZONING CATEGORIES. WHILE THE CASE COULD BE MADE TO STRETCH THE BOUNDARIES A LITTLE, PERHAPS TO IMMEDIATELY ADJACENT PROPERTIES, THAT WOULD HAVE MORE TO DO WITH THE EXPANSION OF THE URBAN CORE CHARACTER. NOT THE SIGN OF A U OF M BUILDING OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. THE CHARACTER OF THESE CATEGORIES ARE SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR URBAN CORE AREAS LIKE D1 AND D2 ARE. THEY ARE NOT TO BE USED ELSEWHERE, WHERE THE ZONING CATEGORIES DO NOT FIT.
00:16:27.220: >> THANK YOU.
00:16:35.194: >> HELLO. MY NAME IS NICK WILKINSON. I LIVE AT 1115 FOUNTAIN STREET. I'M JUST HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE BANNING OF SHORT-TERM RENTALS. I OWN ONE FULL-TIME AIR -- SHORT-TERM RENTAL PROPERTY, AND I HAVE -- I HAVE INTRODUCED MYSELF TO BOTH OF THE NEIGHBORS AND HAVE GOOD RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEM. AND HAVING -- RUNNING THIS PROPERTY AS A SHORT-TERM RENTAL, ACTUALLY, PRODUCES INCOME WHICH I THINK IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE JUST GETTING INTO BUYING RENTAL PROPERTIES AS AN INVESTMENT OR A BUSINESS IN ANN ARBOR TO ACTUALLY MAKE ANY MONEY BECAUSE THE PROPERTIES ARE SO EXPENSIVE AND SO ARE THE PROPERTY TAXES. SO THIS ALLOWS ME -- IT PRODUCES INCOME FOR ME AND MY FAMILY AND ALLOWS ME TO STAY HOME SOME OF THE DAYS WITH OUR NEW DAUGHTER. ON THE OTHER END OF THAT, I ALSO OWN A TRADITIONAL DUPLEX THAT HAS NORMAL, TRADITIONAL TENANTS AND I THINK THE SMARTEST BUSINESS DECISION THAT I COULD MAKE IS ENDING THEIR LEASES AND TURNING THEM INTO SHORT-TERM RENTALS BECAUSE RIGHT NOW, IT'S -- IT'S NOT REALLY PRODUCING MUCH OF ANY INCOME, AND I'M PUTTING A LOT OF WORK FOR NOTHING, ESSENTIALLY. SO I DON'T -- I HAVEN'T DONE THAT AND I DON'T THINK I'M GOING TO, BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT I HAVE DEFINITELY CONSIDERED. SO IT'S ABOUT -- YEAH, IT'S -- HOUSING IS NOT AFFORDABLE IN ANN ARBOR. SO IT'S -- AND THAT'S ONE THE ARGUMENTS IS THAT THESE ARE TAKING UP INVENTORY FOR RENTALS. I THINK SHORT-TERM RENTALS SHOULD BE REGULAR LATED BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IT'S A -- REGULAR LATED BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IT'S A FREE-FOR-ALL, BUT HAVING SOME REGISTRATION AND I THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA BUT TOTALLY BANNING THEM IS PROBABLY NOT THE WAY TO GO. THAT'S IT. THANKS.
00:18:46.258: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU.
00:18:58.471: >> MY NAME IS ALEX GROSS, 758 SOUTH MAPLE AND A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY SPOKE T SPOKEN TO D I DON'T WANT TO TAKE UP TOO MUCH MORE TIME. SAME KIND OF THING, JUST THAT I HAVE A PLACE THAT I WORK WITH MY MOM AND I HELP A FEW OTHER PEOPLE MANAGE AROUND TOWN, AND, YEAH, IT'S JUST YOU MAKE LIFE DECISIONS BASED ON WHAT YOU THINK IS ALLOWED AND YOU SPEND A LOT OF NIGHTS AND WEEKENDS WORKING ON IT, AND, YOU KNOW, JUST WANT TO COME HERE AND MAKE A PERSONAL APPEAL. I HOPE THERE WILL BE A REASONABLE APPROACH INSTEAD OF PUTTING US AMONG THE MOST RESTRICTIVE CITIES IN THE COUNTRY. AND IT SEEMS LIKE ALL THE HOSTS THAT I TALKED TO, INCLUDING THE ONES HERE, LIKE THIS, I MEAN, WE ARE ALL FOR KIND OF REASONABLE REGISTRATION AND TAXING OR WHATEVER IT IS. BUT, YEAH, JUST THAT -- YEAH, IT'S HARD WHEN YOU MAKE DECISIONS AND I WANT TO GET UP AND GET A PERSONAL APPEAL. YEAH, THERE'S -- LIKE PEOPLE SAID, THERE ARE A LOT OF ADVANTAGES BOTH IN TERMS OF PEOPLE COMING TO THE CITY AND REALLY NOT OF DISADVANTAGES. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
00:20:06.005: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION?
00:20:14.747: >> ALL RIGHT. SEEING NO ONE, WE WILL MOVE ON TO PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULED FOR OUR NEXT MEETING WHICH SUR NEXT REGULAR MEETING, WHICH IS FEBRUARY 20th, 2020.
00:20:26.959: >> A PUBLIC HEARING WILL BE HELD ON THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 20th AT 7 P.M. FOR 3874 RESEARCH PARK DRIVE, SITE PLAN FOR CITY COUNCIL. THE PROPOSAL TO DEMOLISH THE EXISTING BUILDING AND CONDUCT A RESEARCH AND OFFICE BUILDING ON THE 5.36-ACRE SITE. ACCESS SITE TO THE SITE CONTINUES TO THE SOUTHERN ADJACENT SITE.
00:20:51.951: >> Chair Milshteyn: AND NOW WE ARE ON REGULAR BUSINESS. FIRST ITEM IS THE GARNET PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT AND SITE PLAN FOR CITY COUNCIL. THE PETITIONER WILL HAVE UP TO TEN MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION. WE WILL THEN GET A STAFF REPORT, FOLLOWED BY A PUBLIC HEARING AND THEN DISCUSSION AND A VOTE. SO WE WILL BEGIN WITH THE PETITIONER.
00:21:12.404: >> GOOD EVENING, I'M BRAD MOORE, ARCHITECTER FOR THE PROJECT. YOU MAY REMEMBER US FROM A PREVIOUS MACHINATION OF THE PROJECT AND THE PUD PRESUBMISSION MEETING THAT WE HAD. THIS IS AN IDENTICAL, FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES PROPOSAL TO WHAT THIS BODY RECOMMENDED CITY COUNCIL APPROVE PREVIOUSLY, UNDER A DIFFERENT ZONING CLASSIFICATION. IT WAS DETERMINED BY ENOUGH OF THE CITY COUNCILMEMBERS THAT THEY DID NOT FEEL THAT THE PREVIOUS PROPOSAL FOR THE ZONING DESIGNATION OF C1A WAS APPROPRIATE AND MOST OF THOSE CITY COUNCIL PEOPLE WHO EXPRESSED THAT OPINION ALSO EXPRESSED THE OPINION THAT THEY LIKED THE PROJECT, THEY JUST WOULD RATHER IT COME BACK AS A PUD AND SO THAT'S WHY I STAND BEFORE YOU TONIGHT. SO I'M JUST GOING TO RUN THROUGH THE PROJECT TO REFRESH MEMORY THAT MAY HAVE LAPSED OR GONE COLD OVER THE COURSE OF A YORE PRACTICALLY -- AND I KNOW THERE ARE A FEW NEW PEOPLE HERE. THIS IS AS LOCATION MAP. YOU MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH THIS WILL HOLD MICHIGON SITE. AND THAT'S DEPOT STREET, THE TRAIN STATION IS JUST KIND OF NORTHEAST OF US. HOW DO I ADVANCE THIS, JOE? JUST CLICK?
00:22:45.164: >> ROLL. JUST ROLL THE WHEEL.
00:22:48.300: >> AH.
00:22:48.534: >> THERE YOU GO.
00:22:50.369: >> OKAY. SO HERE WE GO. HERE IS A PLAN OF THE BUILDING SITTING ON THE SITE. THE BUILDING IS ON THE CORNER OF BROADWAY AND SUMMIT AND ALSO ON THE CORNER OF SUMMIT AND AN ALLEY THAT GOES BETWEEN SUMMIT AND DEPOT ON THE WEST. THIS IS A FIRST FLOOR, WHICH SHOWS THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE BUILDING TO THE SITE. IT'S NOT EXACTLY A RECTANGULAR SITE, BECAUSE THE BROADWAY IS AT AN ANGLE. THE SITE SLOPES FROM THE SOUTHWEST CORNER DOWN TOWARDS THE NORTHEAST CORNER. SO THERE'S A DIAGONAL SLOPE ACROSS THE SITE AND WE CREATE A BELOW GRADE PARKING LEVEL BELOW THE BUILDING AND THEN PLACE THE RESIDENTIAL LEVEL ON THE TOP AND THEN YOU SEE THE RESIDENTIAL LEVEL WHERE THERE'S A SINGLE DWELLING UNIT ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE BUILDING AND TWO DWELLING UNITS ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE BUILDING. ALL THE UNITS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED WITH LARGE OUTDOOR LIVING SPACES BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH TODAY MAY NOT BE AN EXAMPLE, WE DO GET NACE WEATHER OCCASIONALLY AND IT'S NICE TO BE ABLE TO SIT OUT ON A PATIO, RATHER THAN HAVING SOME PLACE TO HAVE A TOMATO PLANT. HERE YOU CAN SIT OUT AND ENJOY. THIS IS THE BASEMENT GARAGE THAT'S TUCKED UNDERNEATH THE BUILDING. YOU MAY RECALL THAT IN AN EARLIER VERSION OF THE PLANNING COMMISSION, WE SAW WE HAD MORE VEHICULAR PARKING AND LESS BICYCLE PARKING. IT WAS SUGGESTED BY THE PLANNING COMMISSIONERS AT THAT TIME, THAT WE TRY TO MAYBE GET RID OF A PARKING SPACE AND ADD MORE BIKE PARKING, WHICH WE DID. SO WE NOW HAVE IN ADDITION TO THE FOUR ON SITE CLASS C PARKING, WE HAVE A TOTAL OF 19 BIKE PARKING SPACES IN THE BASEMENT FOR A TOTAL OF TEN UNITS IN THE BUILDING. AND THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES FOR EACH OF THE PARKING SPACES TO ALSO HANG A BIKE OVER THEIR HOOD IF THEY WANT EVEN MORE BIKE PARKING AND THEY CAN ALSO REORGANIZE. WE HAVE SHOWN A LOT OF THESE BIKES AS THE REGULAR HORIZONTAL GROUPED TYPE. THERE ARE MORE EFFICIENT WAYS OF DOUBLE STACK TYPE OF ARRANGEMENTS, IF THE CONDOMINIUM OWN BEERS WANT TO DO THAT. THEY CAN PUT MORE BIKES THAN THAT. WE HAVE ALMOST TWO PER DWELLING. THIS IS THE SECOND FLOOR. THIS IS THE THIRD AND THE FOURTH FLOOR. THE THIRD AND FOURTH FLOORS STEP BACK. YOU CAN SEE ON THE WESTERN SIDE OF THE BOUNDARY, OF THE TWO LOWER FLOORS IS HERE. ON THE UPPER FLOOR, THE BUILDING STEPS BACK FROM THE ALLEY. SO THAT ON THE TOP TWO FLOORS, THERE'S ONLY TWO DWELLING UNITS. THEN WE HAVE A GREEN ROOF. WE PROPOSED A GREEN ROOF FOR MOST OF THIS ROOF SURFACE, THAT WILL FILLER IT AND REDUCE THE HEAT ON EFFECT AND BE A PELLENATEOR- -- POLLINATOR-FRIENDLY ENVIRONMENT UP ON THE ROOF. THIS QUICK SITE SECTION. THESE ARE THE 2D ELEVATIONS, AND THIS SHOWS -- THIS IS LOOKING FROM SUMMIT NORTHWARDS. SO YOU CAN SEE HOW THE BUILDING GOES UP TWO FLOORS AND THEN STEPS BACK. SO IT OPENS UP ON THE WESTERN SIDE HERE AND YOU CAN SEE ALL OF THE OUTDOOR LIVING SPACES. WE HAVE MADE A FEW CHANGES FROM THE PREVIOUS ITERATION IN THAT -- IN TALKING TO POTENTIAL BUYERS, WE CHANGED SOME OF THE GRILL WORK IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT. ESSENTIALLY THE WINDOWS ARE THE SAME SIZE. THEY JUST HAVE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT GRILL WORK PATTERNS AND WE ALSO CHANGED TO A MORE DECORATIVE RAILING STYLE THAN JUST THE PURE LINEAR RAILINGS. SO THIS WOULD BE THE EAST ELEVATION LOOKING WEST AND THIS IS THE NORTH ELEVATION LOOKING SOUTH AND YOU CAN SEE THE HOW THE BILLING STEPS UP -- BUILDING STEPS UP. YOU CAN SEE THE GARAGE DOOR GOING IN UNDERNEATH THE BUILDING. THAT IS THE TRASH ROOM DOOR SO THAT THE TRASH CARTS CAN BE MOVED OUT. HERE'S THE COLORED VERSION OF THE SOUTH ELEVATION FROM LOOKING NORTH FROM SUMMIT. THE BRICK COLOR HAS CHANGED MORE FROM RAY RED BRICK TO A MORE CHICAGO COMMONS STYLE ORANGE BRIDGE WRAP AROUND. AND MUCH OF THE TRIM HAS GONE TO A DEEP GREEN AS OPPOSED TO A BROWN. THE OWNERS WERE TRYING TO, AGAIN, INCORPORATE A LITTLE BIT MORE OF THE COLOR IN THE BUILDING. IN IS ALSO THE SAME COLOR SCHEME ON THE EAST ELEVATION, ON THE NORTH ELEVATION AND ON THE WEST ELEVATION. WE ENVISIONED THE DOOR GOING INTO THE GARAGE TO BE SMOKED OR CLOUDY GLASS SO THAT WE GET SOME NATURAL LIGHT COMING INTO THE GARAGE BASE, WHEREAS THE DOOR TO THE STORAGE AREA WOULD BE SOLID. A QUICK 3D ELEVATION FROM THE COMPLICATED INTERSECTION THERE OF BROADWAY AND SUMMIT, LOOKING AT THE BUILDING. AGAIN, THIS IS ROTATED AS IF YOU WERE HEADED UP TOWARDS THE BROADWAY BRIDGE. AND I THINK THAT'S THE LAST SLIDE WE HAVE. I HOPE THAT'S ADEQUATELY DESCRIBED PROJECT, TEN RESIDENTIAL UNITS. WE HAVE 11 TRUE PARKING SPACES OF THE CITY. WE HAVE A COUPLE OF SMALLER VEHICLE STORAGE AREAS SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY GET THEM IN THE GARAGE DOWNSTAIRS AND 19 BIKES DOWNSTAIRS AND I THINK THAT'S A QUICK DESCRIPTION IN THE TEN MINUTES ALLOTTED. I CAN GO INTO SOME OTHER DETAILS ABOUT THE PROJECTS AND HOW WE ENDED UP HEREN AI WILL SAVE THAT FOR THE -- HERE AND I WILL SAVE THAT FOR THE PUBLIC HEARING AND IF YOU HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS, WE HAVE OUR CIVIL ENGINEER AND IF THERE'S QUESTIONS ABOUT STORMWATER OR REMOVING ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION ON THE SITE, WE CAN ANSWER ALL OF YOUR QUESTIONS TONIGHT HOPEFULLY.
00:29:04.376: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU. WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO MS. THATCHER FOR THE STAFF REPORT.
00:29:13.885: >> I THINK I'M JUST GOING TO USE THESE SLIDES BECAUSE THEY ARE PRETTY MUCH THE SAME SLIDES THAT I HAVE. SO VERY QUICKLY LET'S SEE -- SO THERE'S CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL PUD ZONING DISTRICT APPLICATIONS. THE FIRST IS JUST THE APPLICATION THAT REQUIRES A BUNCH OF HISTORY ON SITE, SURROUNDING LAND USES AND HOW IT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE MASTER PLAN. ONE OF THE THRESHOLD REQUIREMENTS IS THAT FOR CERTAIN APPLICATIONS THAT HAVE A RESIDENTIAL COMPONENT THAT'S BEYOND THE BASE ZONING REQUIREMENT, AND THERE'S A LITTLE BIT MORE ON THAT IN THE STAFF REPORT, BUT IT DOES REQUIRE AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING CONTRIBUTION OR UNITS, AND THAT IS A GET YOU IN THE DOOR TO THE PUD THAT DOES NOT COUNT TOWARDS YOUR PUBLIC BENEFITS. THAT'S REQUIRED OF ALL PUD PROJECTS MEET THAT THRESHOLD. THERE ARE ALSO BENEFICIAL EFFECTS THAT ARE REQUIRED. THESE ARE IN 529.10F, STANDARDS FOR PUD ZONING DISTRICT. I LISTED THEM IN THE STAFF REPORT. THESE ARE NOT, IF YOU LOOK ON THE THIRD PAGE OF THE STAFF REPORT, A THROUGH G, THESE ARE NOT INCLUSIVE. THEY ARE EXAMPLES OF THE KINDS OF BENEFITS THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED AS BEING BENEFICIAL TO THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY AND THEREFORE MAKING THE PUD AN APPROPRIATE KIND OF ZONING DISTRICT FOR THIS SITE. THEN THERE ARE SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS PROVIDED AND THEY ALSO LIST THE PUBLIC BENEFITS TO THE UNIT THAT ARE PROVIDED BY THE PROJECT. SUPPLEMENTAL REGS IN THIS CASE, BASICALLY, PROPOSED TO MATCH OR SLIGHTLY EXCEED THE CURRENT ZONING, THE FLOOR AREA IS BUMPED UP FROM 150 TO 200%. THE SETBACKS ARE THE SAME AS THE PREVIOUS PETITION. THEY ARE JUST CODIFIED IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS INSTEAD OF CONDITIONS TO A DIFFERENT ZONING DISTRICT. THERE ARE TWO LANDMARK TREES ON THE SITE. ONE IS PROPOSED TO BE REMOVED AND THE OTHER WOULD BE MITIGATED FOR. THE FIRST FLUSH STORMWATER MANAGEMENT WILL BE REQUIRED AND THAT WILL BE CAPTURED BY A GREEN ROOF AND NO INFILTRATION ON THE SITE IS NOT ALLOWED BECAUSE IT'S A HIGHLY CONTAMINATED SITE AND THEY WILL MAKE A PARKLAND CONTRIBUTION OF $652. THERE'S A FUTURE LAND USE OF COMMERCIAL AND OFFICE OF THIS BLOCK. RESIDENTIAL IS APPROPRIATE UNDER THE CURRENT ZONING DISTRICT. AND STAFF'S COMMENTS -- SO THE PROPOSED PUD SITE PLAN MEETS ALL THE DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS IN THE PROPOSED PUD ZONING DISTRICT. WHAT THEY ARE SHOWING HERE ABSOLUTELY MEETS WHAT'S PROPOSED IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS. SO STAFF BELIEVES, THOUGH, THAT THE PUD ZONING DOES NOT MEET THE FIRST OF THE STANDARDS FOR PUD ZONING DISTRICT REVIEW, WHICH IS THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS TO THE CITY THAT CANNOT BE ACHIEVED IN ANY OTHER ZONING DESIGNATION. THERE'S SOME CONFUSION ABOUT THIS EARLIER TODAY, AND IN THE STAFF REPORT, IT SAYS THAT THE BENEFITS COULD BE ACHIEVED BY THE C1A ZONING DISTRICT. WE HAVE BEEN DOWN THAT ROAD WITH CONDITIONS AND IT WAS DENIED BY CITY COUNCIL. IT'S SAYING THAT THERE'S A THRESHOLD THAT YOU HAVE TO CROSS. YOU CAN'T ACHIEVE THIS ANYWHERE ELSE, BUT, IN FACT THIS COULD ACHIEVED AS A C1A. THE PROJECT DEFINITELY HAS MERITS FIRST GO AROUND, AND STAFF SUPPORTED IT. IT'S APPROPRIATE SIZE AND SCALE AND USE FOR THE SITE. IT HAS A LOT OF GOOD THINGS GOING FOR IT. THE PROBLEM IS THAT IT JUST DOESN'T MEET THE CRITERIA FOR PUBLIC BENEFITS THAT A PUD PROJECT REQUIRES. IN STAFF'S OPINION, I AM -- I AM INTERPRETING CODE HERE, AND WHETHER OR NOT I BELIEVE IT MEETS IT. AND SO THAT IS MERELY STAFF'S OPINION, AND THE PLANNING COMMISSION AND THE COUNCIL WILL POSSIBLY INTERPRET IT THE SAME WAY OR DIFFERENTLY, BUT THAT'S WHEN -- WHENEVER STAFF READS CODE AND DOES NOT THINK THAT IT IS MET, THEY CANNOT -- THEY CANNOT RECOMMEND APPROVAL OF A PROJECT. IT DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S -- WHAT CHAPTER OF CITY CODE IS. IT COULD BE ANY OF THE STAFF RECEIVERS BUT IN THIS CASE, PLANNING STAFF DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THIS MEETS THE THRESHOLDS FOR PUD ZONING DISTRICT. THANK YOU.
00:33:49.961: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU. AT THIS I AM TOO TIME, I WOULD O OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING ON THIS ISSUE. PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS FOR THE RECORD AND YOU WILL HAVE UP TO THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE LAPPING COMMISSION.
00:34:04.476: >> MY NAME IS CHRIS CROCKETT. I LIVE AT 506 EAST KINGSLEY STREET, NOT FAR FROM THIS PROPOSED PROJECT. AND I'M ALSO PRESIDENT OF THE OLD FOURTH WARD ASSOCIATION. TONIGHT, I'M SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION. LAST WEEK, WE HAD A BOARD MEETING, AND UNANIMOUSLY, OUR BOARD, 12 MEMBERS, WHO ARE -- WHO MAKE UP THE BOARD OF THE OLD 4th WARD ASSOCIATION AGREED THAT THIS IS A GOOD PROJECT AND WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT BUILT. PERSONALLY, I HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH KELLY FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS NOW. SHE SHOWED ME THIS PROJECT WHEN IT WAS IN THE CONCEPTUAL STAGE AND IT WAS AGREED AT THAT TIME, THAT IT LOOKED LIKE A REALLY APPROPRIATE PROJECT FOR THE NORTH CENTRAL AREA, WHICH IS ADJACENT TO THE OLD FOURTH WARD HISTORIC DISTRICT. THIS PROJECT WAS REJECTED BY CITY COUNCIL, WHICH RECOMMENDED THAT IT COME BACK AS A PUD. SO YOU CAN'T IMAGINE OUR AMAZEMENT WHEN WE READ THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION FOR DENIAL. IT'S THE SAME PROJECT THAT WAS PASSED BEFORE. AND CITY COUNCIL RECOMMENDED THAT IT BE A PUD. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CRITERIA THAT SHOULD BE MET OR CAN BE MET, BUT NOT ALL OF THEM HAVE TO BE MET. THIS IS A HANDSOME BUILDING. IT'S APPROPRIATE IN DESIGN, SIZE, AND SCALE FOR THE NORTH CENTRAL PROPERTY OWNERS AREA. IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR OUR RESIDENTIAL AREA. AND WE LIKE THIS PROJECT VERY MUCH. IT WILL BRING A DOZEN OR MORE RESIDENTS TO OUR NEIGHBORHOOD AND WE ARE HAPPY TO SEE THAT, ESPECIALLY ON I A A PIECE OF PROPERTY WHICH IS NOT CURRENTLY BEING USED AS RESIDENTIAL. IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT IT'S LUXURY DEVELOPMENT. ALL ANN ARBOR DEVELOPMENT IS LUXURY DEVELOPMENT. BUT WHAT ASTONISHES ME IS THIS IS A BUILDING DEVELOPED BY A LOCAL WOMAN WITH LOCAL MONEY IN TRIBUTE TO HER MOTHER, WHO WAS THE PIONEER WOMAN DEVELOPER OF ANN ARBOR. IT'S ASTONISHING TO ME THAT SO MUCH LEEWAY IS GRANTED WITH BIG, DEEP POCKETS AND LOTS OF OUT-OF-TOWN MONEY AND OUT-OF-TOWN ARCHITECTS AND THIS IS BEING LOOKED DOWN UPON SO MUCH BY THE LOCAL PLANNING DEPARTMENT, WITH A LOCAL WOMAN, PAYING TRIBUTE TO A LOCAL WOMAN IN CREATING A BEAUTIFUL BUILDING THAT'S APPROPRIATELY PLACED IN A RESIDENTIAL AREA. I URGE YOU TO PASS THIS PROJECT. I THINK THAT THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT ON THIS OCCASION IS IN ERROR. THIS IS A GOOD PROJECT, AND IT'S A BEAUTIFUL PROJECT AND IT DESERVES TO BE BUILD.
00:37:03.688: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU.
00:37:11.729: >> MY NAME IS JULE RITTER AND A MEMBER OF THE OLD FOURTH WARD, HOWEVER, OLD FOURTH WARD WARD, BUT I'M SPEAKING FOR MYSELF TONIGHT. I SENT AN EMAIL EARLIER TODAY THAT LISTED SEVEN THINGS THAT ARE REASONS WHY I THINK IT SHOULD BE APPROVED AS A PUD AND NOT A C1A. I WILL NOT REPEAT THAT HERE AND IT INCLUDES SU INCLUDES YOU USUE MASTER PLAN AND I'M NOT GOING TO REPEAT THEM. THIS HAS BEEN -- THIS HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS CONDOMINIUM DEVELOPMENTS IN ANN ARBOR IN THE LAST TEN YEARS ON ALL KINDS OF PROPERTY, ALL SHAPES AND ALL SIZES AND ALL PLACES. SIDE STREETS, MAIN STREETS, THROUGH THE BLOCK, INTO THE HILL, NONE OF THEM HAD ANY MORE PUBLIC BENEFIT OR ANY MORE OF THE LONG LIST OF QUALITIES THAT STAFF HAS USED TO JUSTIFY THE REJECTION OF THIS PUD ZONING, THAN THIS BEAUTIFUL PROPERTY THAT WE ALL REALLY LIKE. ALL OF THOSE CONDOS WENT THROUGH WITH BARELY A WHISPER. I HAVE NOT HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO ININVESTIGATE THE ZONING OF ALL THE CONDOS BUT THE FACT THAT THIS TINY LITTLE LOT IN THE RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD, THE STAFF -- THE ONLY ZONING THAT STAFF CAN COME UP WITH IS A CAMPUS ZONING WITH UNLIMITED HEIGHT, IT WOULD BE LAUGHABLE IF IT WEREN'T SO EGREGIOUS. IT'S PATHETIC. AND SO BLINDSIDE THIS YOUNG DEVELOPER WHO WE SHOULD BE LIFTING UP AND CELEBRATING, AND INSTEAD BEING TREATED MISERABLY. IT'S NOT ABOUT THE DESIGN, IT'S ABOUT ANOTHER AGENDA. I CAN EASILY GUESS THAT IT'S AIMED AT SIDELINING THE UPCOMING MASTER PLAN PROCESS AT EXCLUDING NEIGHBORS AND OTHERS FROM ENGAGEMENT AND COMMENTS. [ NO AUDIO ] PLEASE OVERRIDE THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION AND APPROVE THIS AS A PUD AND IF YOU CAN'T APPROVE IT AS A PUD, CHOOSE ANOTHER ZONING THAT'S A LOT MORE APPROPRIATE. THANK YOU.
00:39:28.232: >> HELLO, THOMAS STALBERG AGAIN, I LIVE AT 1202 TRAVER STREET AND AS YOU HEARD BEFORE, MY NEIGHBORHOOD SUED THE CITY OVER USING CAMPUS BUSINESS ZONING WHERE IT DOESN'T BELONG, AND I WILL FOCUS ON THAT ASPECT HERE. I UNDERSTAND SOME OF WHAT STAFF SAID. THE POINTS THAT STAFF MADE ABOUT THE PUD, I HEAR YOU. AND I'M A DEVELOPER. I HAVE JOINED MY FAMILY BUSINESS 28 YEARS AGO. SO I'M A SECOND GENERATION DEVELOPER, AND MY FATHER IS AN ATTORNEY AND DEVELOPER. THIS WAS DINNER TABLE TALK FOR US, ZONINGS AND I PRESENTED AT TOWNSHIP BOARDS THROUGHOUT OAKLAND COUNTY. SO I JUST GIVE YOU THAT BACKGROUND, SO THAT I'M NOT SOME GUY FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD TALKING. SO WITH WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHY C1A IS NOT A GOOD BAR TO COMPARE THIS TO, WHETHER OR NOT YOU WANT THE PUD, THAT'S ONE ISSUE. BUT YOU CAN'T COMPARE IT TO C1A, C1A IS OFF THE TABLE AT THIS LOCATION. THIS LOCATION IS NOT VALID FOR C1A, BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE CAMPUS BUSINESS AREA AND C1A IS OFF THE TABLE FOR THIS AREA BECAUSE THE CHARACTER OF C1A DOES NOT MATCH THE CHARACTER THAT'S APPROPRIATE FOR THIS LOCATION EITHER. IF YOU CAN DO C1A, CONSIDER WHY IN THE C1AR, IT'S THE COMPANION DISTRICT THAT'S RESIDENTIAL WHERE C1A'S INTENT IS COMMERCIAL. YOU CAN DO RESIDENTIAL UNDER C1B SO THERE IS NOT REALLY A NEED IF YOU WANT TO LOOK AT IT THAT WAY TO GO TO C1A, JUST BECAUSE THE NUMBERS AND LETTERS ARE CLOSE, IT DOESN'T THE MEAN THOSE TWO CATEGORIES ARE CLOSE. THEY ARE VERY DIFFERENT CATEGORIES. IN A REZONING. ONE OF THE THINGS YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO DEMONSTRATE, WHY DO YOU HAVE TO REZONE IT? WHERE IS THE ERROR, THE CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES. AND THAT'S NOT RECOGNIZED, IF YOU TALK ABOUT C1A AT THAT LOCATION, BECAUSE IT CAN BE DEVELOPED, RESIDENTIALLY, RIGHT NOW UNDER ITS CURRENT ZONING. SO, AGAIN, I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND USING C1A JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN MAKE THIS BUILDING FIT C1A, IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT'S THE APPROPRIATE BAR TO COMPARE THIS PROJECT TO. WE LOOK AT WHAT'S THE BIG PROBLEM THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IF WE WENT C1A AT THIS LOCATION? IT'S NOT WHETHER THEY WILL SUE OR NOT. THAT'S UP TO THEM. IT'S SMALL POTATOES. IF WE COME CAMPUS BUSINESS ZONING, THE CITY IS SETTING THEM UP -- YOURSELVES UP FOR A LAWSUIT. SIMILAR TO A COTTAGES LAWSUIT OR THE WEBER PETERS BUILDING LAWSUIT WHERE YOU ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE A CHANCE TO WIN. YOUR CITY ATTORNEY WILL TELL YOU THAT YOU WILL LOSE AND YOU WILL HAVE TO NOT FIGHT IT BECAUSE SOME BIG POCKET DEVELOPER WILL COME IN WITH A C1A OR C1AR, AND YOU WILL BE HORRIFIED. WE CANNOT LET C1A AND C1AR OUT OF THE BOX. THANK YOU.
00:42:36.354: >> GOOD EVENING. I'M GOING TO SPEAK AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEVELOPER. SO I DON'T KNOW IF I GET MY THREE ARE OR FIVE.
00:42:43.995: >> TECHNICALLY YOU ALREADY HAD TEN.
00:42:45.129: >> BUT THAT WAS FOR THE PRESENTATION OF THE PROJECT, NOT FOR THE PUBLIC HEARING.
00:42:50.201: >> RIGHT.
00:42:51.269: >> BECAUSE WHAT I WANT TO SPEAK TO NOW IS SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN MENTIONED. I WILL TRY TO MAKE IT THREE. I UNDERSTAND THAT, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU LOOK ON PAPER THAT THERE'S A THEORETICAL APPLICATION OF A C1A, BUT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE ARE A HE WILL WORLD, AND IN THE REAL WORLD, THERE'S NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE ON CITY COUNCIL WHO BELIEVE THAT C1A IS APPROPRIATE FOR THIS SITE. SO I WOULD SUGGEST THAT IN THE REAL WORLD, WHERE WE HAVE TO FUNCTION, C1A, WE TRIED IT. WE WERE TOLD IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK. WE COULDN'T GET THE VOTES FOR THE PROJECT AND WE DON'T BELIEVE C1A IS A VIABLE PATH BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN SHOWN THAT IT ISN'T. IN TERMS OF THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS, THE ZONING ORDINANCE LISTS THAT PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS DESIGNED FEATURES OR AMENITIES PROPOSED SHOULD HAVE THE BENEFICIAL EFFECT OF THE CITY IN TERMS OF PUBLIC HEALTH, SAFETY, WELFARE, AESTHETICS, OR CONVENIENCE OR ANY COMBINATION OF THESE. THERE'S DEFINITELY A PUBLIC HEALTH BENEFIT HERE BECAUSE WE ARE MOVING TONS AND TONS AND TONS EVER CONTAMINATED SOIL THROUGH THE PROJECT AND THEN WE ARE PUTTING DOWN A VAPOR BARRIER TO PREVENT WATER FROM LEACHING INTO THE -- ANY REMAINING CONTAMINANTS AND PUSHING THAT TOWARDS THE RIVER. SO THERE'S A DEFINITE PUBLIC HEALTH BENEFIT FROM THIS PROJECT MOVING FORWARD. AND REDUCTION OF CONTAMINANTS IN THE CITY AND MIGRATION OF CONTAMINANTS. IT IS -- WE THINK IT QUALIFIES UNDER AESTHETICS BECAUSE WE HAVE USED THE PALLET OF MATERIALS THAT ARE COMMON TO THE DISTRICT. AND THUS ENHANCING THE NEIGHBORHOOD AS OPPOSED TO USING CORRUGATED METAL SIDING OR SOME OTHER MATERIAL THAT WAS NOT AESTHETICALLY COMPATIBLE WITH THE NEIGHBORHOOD. IT CERTAINLY QUALIFIES UNDER THE CONVENIENCE FOR THE PEOPLE WHO WILL LIVE THERE BECAUSE IN ADDITION TO THE BICYCLE PARKING WE HAVE PROVIDED, THEY DON'T HAVE TO HAVE T A CAR TO MOVE AROUND THE CITY, THEY CAN REDUCE THEIR CARBON FOOTPRINT AND ALL OF THESE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ACCRUED TO THE PROJECT AND IN TERMS OF THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CONTRIBUTION, YOU MAY REMEMBER, WHEN COUNCIL TOLD US TO BRING IT BACK AS A PUD IN AUGUST, THE BASIS FOR CALCULATING THE RESIDENTIAL DENSITIES OF THE PROJECT AND THEREFORE THE CONTRIBUTIONS REQUIRED WAS BASED ON THE UNDERLYING MAXIMUM DENSITY ALLOWED IN THE ZONING DISTRICT THAT WAS THE UNDERLYING ZONING DISTRICT. THERE'S NO MAXIMUM UNDERLYING ZONING DENSITY IN THIS DISTRICT. IF YOU COULD HAVE A 10 SQUARE FOOT APARTMENT, YOU COULD HAVE 85 OF THEM ON THE PROJECT. SO WE LOOKED AT WHAT WOULD COST AS A CONTRIBUTION FOR A SINGLE UNIT OF ABOUT 700 SQUARE FEET. THAT CALCULATION WAS 88,200 AND THAT'S THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT THE DEVELOPERS HAVE PROPOSED TO PUT TOWARDS THE AFFORDABLE UNIT. THANK YOU.
00:45:55.686: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE WISHING TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION WITH REGARDS TO THIS ITEM? SEEING NO ONE, I WILL CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING AND I WILL READ THE MOTION. THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION HEREBY RECOMMENDS THAT THE MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL APPROVE THE GARNET UNIT DEVELOPMENT AND PUD SITE PLAN AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT. MOVED BY COMMISSIONER MILLS AND SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN AND WE ARE IN DISCUSSION. COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN.
00:46:26.317: >> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR. THANK YOU TO THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY AND TO THE DEVELOPMENT TEAM FOR COMING BACK OUT TON. THANKS TO MS. ASHER FOR HER REVIEW. I'M NOT GOING TO SPEAK TOO MUCH TO SUBSTANCE. I THINK THERE ARE HOURS OF FOOTAGE ONLINE OF US DELIBERATING THIS VERY SITE AND THIS VERY PROJECT. SO FEEL FREE TO LOG ONLINE AND WATCH ALL OF IT. I WANT TO SET SOME TONE AND CONTEXT. BUT FIRST, I DO WANT TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE COMMENTS MADE TOWARDS CITY STAFF. WE HAVE A TREMENDOUSLY PROFESSIONAL CIVIL SERVICE HERE IN THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR, WHO DOES THEIR JOBS EXCEEDINGLY WELL, AND IN RESPONSE TO THE DIRECTION OF THE ELECTED BODIES, CITY COUNCIL. I THINK MS. THATCHER AND HER TEAM DID A GOOD JOB AND AN APPROPRIATE JOB IN THIS CASE. WHILE I DON'T AGREE WITH THEIR FINDINGS, I THINK IT WAS PROFESSIONALLY PREPARED AND DELIVERED. TO PUT ANY CONSPIRACIES TO REST, PLANNING STAFF ATTEMPTED TO GET THIS PROJECT TO THE FINISH LINE AND, IN FACT, THEY DID AND CITY COUNCIL, A GROUP OF ELECTED OFFICIALS VOTED IT DOWN GIVING THIS VERY DIRECTION. SO TO SAY THAT CITY STAFF WAS WORKING TO ARM OR TO DELAY A LOCAL DEVELOPER, WHILE AFFORDING OTHER LUXURIES TO OUT-OF-STATE DEVELOPERS IS NOT FAIR. AND I WANT TO SET THAT RECORD STRAIGHT. NOW, BACK TO MY INTENDED COMMENTS ABOUT TONE AND CONTEXT. THIS IS A GOOD PROJECT. IT WAS A GOOD PROJECT WHEN WE SAW IT AS C1AR AND IT'S A GOOD PROJECT AS A PUD. I VOTED FOR IT TWICE AND I WILL BE VOTING FOR IT TWICE AGAIN. I THINK IT'S A GOOD PROJECT BECAUSE IT PLACES RESIDENTS CLOSER TO WHERE THEY WORK. IT'S WITHIN A WALKING PROXIMITY OF THE TWO LARGEST EMPLOYERS IN THE. OF THE COUNTY AND TWO OF THE LARGEST EMPLOYEES IN SOUTHEASTERN MICHIGAN. THAT TAKES CARS OFF THE ROOKED WHEN PEOPLE -- THE ROAD, WHEN PEOPLE CAN WALK TO WORK. WHICH REDUCES EMISSION. IT RESPECTS THE KERRYTON AND THE OLD FOURTH WARD HISTORIC CHARACTER IN ITS DESIGN AND ITS BUILDING MATERIALS, AND IT CLEANS UP A CONTAMINATED SITE, AND IT OFFERS GREEN FEATURES LIKE A LARGE NUMBER OF BIKE SPACES, A GREEN ROOF, AND ENERGY EFFICIENT DESIGN. AND SO WITH THAT, I WILL LEAVE IT THERE. I'M SURE COLLEAGUES HAVE COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS BUT I INTEND TO VOTE FOR THIS TONIGHT.
00:48:56.167: >> COMMISSIONER MILLS?
00:48:59.737: >> Vice Chair Mills: THANK YOU. AND THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME FOLLOW COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN, WHO SAID MOST OF WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY, BUT FAR MORE ELOQUENTLY THAN I COULD SAY IT. SO THANK YOU. I COME TO THE SAME CONCLUSION IN TERMS OF I THINK THE STANDARDS THAT WE HAVE, I DON'T DISAGREE WITH THE STAFF REPORT, BUT I THINK THAT THE REMEDIATION FEATURES -- OR THE SITE REMEDIATION AND THE GREEN ROOF IN ITSELF ARE BENEFICIAL HERE. AGAIN, I WOULD GO BACK TO THE RECORD. I THINK THIS WAS FINE THE FIRST TIME WE SEE IT. I THINK IT'S FIND THE SECOND TIME. I REALLY HAVE QUESTIONS, THOUGH, ABOUT THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CONTRIBUTION AND BOTH BETWEEN THE STAFF REPORT AND KIND OF WHAT WAS JUST SAID, I KNOW WHAT THE PUD CALLS FOR, THAT IF IT EXCEEDS THE UNDERLYING DENSITY THAT -- THAT IT MUST. THERE MUST BE A CONTRIBUTION AND SO CAN YOU HELP US UNDERSTAND HOW YOU ARRIVED AT THE NUMBER? I'VE GOT THE WAY THAT I WOULD HAVE ARRIVED AT IT BUT I WANT TO HEAR FROM STAFF TOO.
00:50:09.440: >> SURE. HANG ON ONE SECOND WHILE I FIND THAT SMALL PIECE OF PAPER. ALL RIGHT. SO THE UNDERLYING INTO RAILROAD AREA DENSITY IS 150%. THIS PUD REQUEST IS FOR A 200%, BECAUSE THAT 50% DIFFERENCE IS LARGER THAN 25%. THEY ARE REQUIRED TO PREPARE THE EQUIVALENT OF -- FOR PROVIDE 15% OF THE FLOOR AREA, AND APPLY THAT TO THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING RATIO. WHAT YOU GET IS 15% OF UNITS IS 1.5 UNITS TIMES -- OH, WHAT'S THE DOLLARS PER SQUARE FOOT? HANG ON. I DON'T HAVE A CALCULATOR OR I WOULD DO THIS BACKWARDS.
00:51:05.663: >> 186, THAT DOESN'T SOUND RIGHT. 126. IT'S $126 PER SQUARE FOOT. TIMES 1.5 UNITS, TIMES THE AVERAGE FLOOR AREA OF THE UNITS, WHICH IN THIS CASE WAS 1,470 SOMETHING SQUARE FEET. THAT'S HOW THE NUMBERS ON THE STAFF REPORT CAME ABOUT. CLEAR AS MUD.
00:51:32.923: >> Vice Chair Mills: IS THAT THE SAME -- SO THE -- I -- THE KIND OF -- HOW Y YOU ARRIVED AT 15% BASED ON THE UNDERLYING F.A.R. THERE'S NO UNDERLYING HOUSING DENSITY.
00:51:47.838: >> CORRECT.
00:51:48.205: >> Vice Chair Mills: IN THE PUD, IT'S EFFECTIVELY AS MUCH AS -- YOU KNOW? AS MANY UNITS AS YOU CAN GET INTO THAT SQUARE FOOTAGE.
00:51:55.512: >> RIGHT. RIGHT. THE EXISTING MAXIMUM RESIDENTIAL DENSITY, THERE'S NO MAXIMUM AND THERE'S NO MINIMUM.
00:52:02.286: >> Vice Chair Mills: SIGHT. IF THE BUILD -- RIGHT. IF THE BUILDING WAS 150F.A.R. -- SORRY, YEAH, THEN THERE WOULD BE NO -- NO EXCEEDING THE UNDERLYING DENSITY. I GET HOW THAT IS THE 46, I THINK BECAUSE IT'S 196.
00:52:20.437: >> RIGHT. RIGHT.
00:52:22.039: >> Vice Chair Mills: SO 46 DIVIDED BY 150, IT'S 31% OVER THE UNDERLYING F.A. R. AND THAT PUTS YOU IN THE TERRITORY OF NEEDING TO GO, IF YOU NEED TO PROVIDE 15%.
00:52:32.349: >> YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO GO ALL THE WAY TO 200%, BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE PUD SUPPLEMENTAL REGS SAY.
00:52:39.423: >> Vice Chair Mills: THANK YOU. SO YOU ARE AT 33% THEN, RIGHT?
00:52:44.928: >> YES.
00:52:45.195: >> Vice Chair Mills: SO THE -- AND SO THAT'S HOW I WRITE IT TO -- THE NUMBER -- THE $126 PER SQUARE FOOT IS SET NOT IN OUR ZONING ORDINANCE BUT THAT'S BY COUNCIL, IN A DIFFERENT DOCUMENT; IS THAT RIGHT?
00:52:59.076: >> YES, AND THAT WAS MOST RECENTLY UPDATED IN AUGUST OF 2019.
00:53:03.981: >> Vice Chair Mills: GOT IT. AND THE 1.5 UNITS, IS MAKING SENSE.
00:53:10.254: >> YEAH, THAT'S THE -- THE 15% OF 10 UNITS. 1.5 UNITS.
00:53:17.861: >> Vice Chair Mills: AND THEN IS THE AVERAGE FLOOR AREA -- BECAUSE I THINK THAT THAT'S PROBABLY WHAT SOME OF THE DIFFERENCE IS, IS THE DECISION TO MULTIPLY IT BY THE AVERAGE SQUARE FOOTAGE FOR A UNIT, IS THAT SPELLED OUT IN THE COUNCIL RESOLUTION ABOUT HOW YOU CALCULATE THE CONTRIBUTION IN LIEU OR --
00:53:37.214: >> THAT IS NOW PART OF CODE THAT WAS ADOPTED BY CITY COUNCIL IN NOVEMBER.
00:53:45.522: >> Vice Chair Mills: GOT IT.
00:53:46.123: >> THAT'S IN THE PUD SECTION OF CODE, NOT IN -- THAT'S NOT PART OF THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING RESOLUTION THAT WAS PASSED BY COUNCIL SETTING THE RATES.
00:54:01.104: >> Vice Chair Mills: GOT IT. SO THAT NUMBER IS IN HERE. BECAUSE THERE'S A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT -- I GUESS I'M UNSURE AT THIS POINT, WHAT EXACTLY -- WHAT KIND OF CONTRIBUTION THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE MAKING BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND BECAUSE THEY -- BECAUSE COUNCIL ASKED -- INSTRUCTED THEM TO GO THE PUD ROUTE, THAT WHAT COMES ALONG WITH THAT IS A CONTRIBUTION TO -- OR PROVIDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING, RIGHT, IF IT EXCEEDS THE UNDERLYING F.A.R., I DON'T DISPUTE THAT. I THINK THAT'S THE CORRECT INTERPRETATION. I GUESS WHAT I'M UNCLEAR ABOUT IS THE PETITIONER IS SAYING ONE NUMBER AND I READ SOMETHING DIFFERENT IN THE STAFF REPORT AND THEN THERE WAS A LETTER THAT SAYS PROVIDES BOTH OF THOSE NUMBERS. I'M CONFUSED AS TO WHAT IT IS RIGHT NOW.
00:54:52.055: >> SO THAT SOMETHING THAT THE PETITIONER SAID MADE MORE SENSE OF THIS TO ME TONIGHT. THEY HAD PROPOSED A NUMBER THAT WAS 88,200, AND THAT COMES FROM THE CITY COUNCIL, AUGUST RESOLUTION. IT WAS AN EXAMPLE OF ONE WAY USING 2018 NUMBERS, A DIFFERENT METHOD OF CALCULATING AN AFFORDABILITY GAP IN HOUSING. IT'S SPELLED OUT IN THE CITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION, FOR A UNIT OF 700 SQUARE FEET USING 2018 NUMBERS. IT'S JUST AN EXAMPLE. IT'S NOT WHAT WAS ADOPTED.
00:55:32.129: >> JUST TO CLARIFY, WE WERE NOT APPROVED IN AUGUST. THAT WAS THE ONLY NUMBER THAT WAS AVAILABLE IN AUGUST WHEN WE WERE TOLD TO PROCEED WITH THE PUD.
00:55:44.975: >> Vice Chair Mills: MM-HMM.
00:55:45.576: >> THAT WAS THE NUMBER MY CLIENTS WENT BACK AND RAN THROUGH THEIR FINANCIAL CALCULATIONS AND DETERMINED THEY COULD MAKE THE PROJECT WORK WITH THAT DONATION. THE SUBSEQUENT CHANGES, WHICH CAME IN NOVEMBER, WERE NOT WHAT MY CLIENTS HAD ANTICIPATED, WHEN THEY WERE TOLD BY COUNCIL IN AUGUST TO MAKE THIS PATH. AND IN POINT OF FACT I REFERENCED THAT NUMBER ON OCTOBER 15th, WHEN WE WERE HERE FOR THE PRESUBMITTAL CONFERENCE BECAUSE THAT WAS WHAT WAS AVAILABLE IN AUGUST.
00:56:20.377: >> Vice Chair Mills: AND IT WASN'T NOVEMBER YET WHEN THEY --
00:56:22.779: >> PRECISELY. THERE'S THE DISCONTINUITY OF WHAT HAPPENED OVER TIME BETWEEN WHEN COUNCIL SAID NO, GO THIS WAY AND THEN WHEN COUNCIL ADOPTED A NEW FORMULA IN NOVEMBER.
00:56:38.895: >> Vice Chair Mills: YEAH, GOT IT.
00:56:39.796: >> I WILL CLARIFY ONE MORE PIECE OF THIS. THE NOVEMBER ORDINANCE CHANGES CLARIFIED THE ORDINANCE. THEY DIDN'T CHANGE IT. , THEY CLARIFIED WHAT HAD ALREADY BEEN GOING ON WITH USING FLOOR AREA IN RESIDENTIAL PROJECTS IN ZONES THAT ARE NOT RESIDENTIAL. IT DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING. IT JUST CLARIFY THE METHOD TO THAT, TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO SORT OUT WHAT TO DO WITH UNDERLYING RESIDENTIAL ZONING AND WHAT TO DO WITH ALL OTHER UNDERLYING ZONINGS IF YOU ARE BUILDING RESIDENTIAL. I REALIZE THAT DOESN'T MAKE A WHOLE LOT OF SENSE RIGHT NOW, UNLESS YOU ARE LOOKING AT BOTH OF THEM, BUT IT WAS REALLY MEANT AS A CLARIFICATION. IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE CODE THAT WAS USED PREVIOUSLY.
00:57:28.845: >> Vice Chair Mills: GOT IT. SO THIS HAS GOT TO BE FRUSTRATING! IT'S GOT TO BE FRUSTRATING, RIGHT? IT'S SOMETHING THAT, LIKE, THE BUILDING HASN'T CHANGED, RIGHT? BUT IN ORDER TO USE THE ZONE THAT YOU WERE INSTRUCTED TO USE, THERE WAS CRITERIA THAT HAVE TO BE MET. AND LIKE I SAID, THIS IS WHERE I WOULD DISAGREE WITH STAFF, IN TERMS OF I THINK THERE ARE SOME ADDITIONAL BENEFITS THAT ARE PROVIDED BY THIS BUILDING THAT HONESTY WERE OFFERED THE FIRST TIME AROUND, RIGHT? I JUST SAYING, LIKE IT'S ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT WAS REQUIRED THE FIRST TIME AROUND. THE REMEDIATION AND THE GREEN ROOF, RIGHT? AND SO I THINK IT'S LEGIT TO COUNT THAT AS THE BENEFITS TOWARDS THE PUD BUT I THINK THE THING WE HAVE TO SORT OUT IS THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING COMPONENT, AND FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, LIKE THAT'S WHAT WE REQUIRE OF ALL PUDs, LIKE, I -- I DON'T SEE A WAY -- AND I DON'T THINK -- I WOULDN'T WANT TO SET THE PRECEDENT OF CHANGING THAT. I DON'T THINK -- AGAIN, I WOULD HAVE APPROVED -- I DID SUGGEST TO APPROVE THIS WITHOUT THAT. AND SO THAT'S WHAT'S REALLY FRUSTRATING BECAUSE ADDING $200,000 ON TO THE TOP OF THIS, DOES NOTHING TO INCREASE AFFORDABILITY IN ANN ARBOR. SURE, IT'S ADDING MONEY TO THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUND BUT IT'S MAKING THESE UNITS MORE EXPENSIVE. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I'M PERSONALLY STRUGGLING WITH AND I'M SORRY THAT I'M CHANNELING MY, LIKE, UNFORTUNATE, THAT THIS IS KIND OF PLACE THAT WE ARE AT. SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE VOTING ON TONIGHT, IT'S MAKING THE ASSUMPTION OF THE CALCULATION OF 200 -- THE 200 NUMBER THAT YOU FAME UP WITH, THAT STAFF CAME UP WITH, BASED ON WHAT'S IN THERE.
00:59:27.264: >> YEP.
00:59:27.531: >> AND I GUESS THE QUESTION KIND OF TO THE PETITIONER IS, LIKE, DO YOU STILL WANT US TO GO FORWARD? CAN YOU STILL ACTUALLY DO THAT BECAUSE I DON'T SEE HOW WE CAN CHANGE THAT.
00:59:37.307: >> SO THE PROJECT CAN'T HAPPEN WITH THAT SIZE OF A CONTRIBUTION AT THAT LEVEL, BUT THAT'S A NEGATIVE PROFIT FOR THE DEVELOPER. THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DO THE PROJECT. SO IT WOULD MEAN ZERO UNITS.
00:59:50.587: >> Vice Chair Mills: GOT IT.
00:59:51.488: >> NO AFFORDABLE, NO NOTHING.
00:59:55.358: >> Vice Chair Mills: YEAH. YEAH. WHAT I'M JUST SAYING IS, LIKE -- WHAT WE CAN VOTE ON IS WHAT IS IN THERE NOW, AND I WOULD SAY THAT IF WE ARE GOING TO BE CONSISTENT IN APPLYING THIS, I DO THINK THAT THERE'S THE BENEFIT BUT WE NEED TO BE CONSISTENT ON THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. I THINK IT MEETS THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING, I WILL PLAN TO VOTE YES. I, LIKE, AGAIN, WOULD HAVE VOTED, YOU KNOW -- I DID VOTE YES LAST YEAR. SO THOSE ARE MY COMMENTS ON IT.
01:00:30.026: >> Chair Milshteyn: SO MS. THATCHER, SO WHAT WE ARE VOTING FOR -- I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR. THE NUMBER IS 200 AND -- SO PER THE DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT, AND PER OUR RECORD, $279,078 IS WHAT WILL BE CONTRIBUTED TO THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUND?
01:00:51.715: >> YES. IIF CITY COUNCIL WANTS TO ADDRES THAT OR ANY OTHER CHANGES TO THIS PETITION, THAT'S UP TO THEM. BUT, REALLY, THAT PACKAGE IS WHAT YOU ALL ARE VOTING ON TONIGHT.
01:01:07.030: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANKS. COMMISSIONER ABONS.
01:01:09.332: >> Commissioner Abrons:  BUT WE ARE VOTING ON THAT BUT THE COMMISSIONER IS TELLING US THAT THAT NUMBER IS NOT ACCEPTABLE, BUT WE DISREGARD THAT INPUT? I JUST NEED A LI LITTLE GUIDANCE FROM STAFF ABOUT THIS. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO --
01:01:22.812: >> YES SO IT -- IT -- THIS BODY CAN'T CHANGE CITY CODE. YOU CAN --
01:01:29.486: >> Commissioner Abrons: RIGHT.
01:01:32.255: >> AND YES, THERE'S A DISCONNECT BETWEEN WHAT THE DEVELOPERS WOULD LIKE TO CONTRIBUTE AND WHAT THE FORMULA IS SAYING THEY NEED TO CONTRIBUTE. SO -- BUT WHAT THEY NEED TO CONTRIBUTE AND WHAT'S IN THE DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT, AND WHAT'S IN THE STAFF REPORT IS WHAT IS -- IS THE STARTING PLACE. BECAUSE, AGAIN, YOU CAN'T CHANGE WHAT IS REQUIRED BY CODE, AS THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
01:02:00.183: >> Commissioner Abrons: RIGHT. SO DOES THE BE PETITIONER WANT S TO VOTE ON A PETITION THAT INCLUDES A $279,000 CONTRIBUTION? THAT'S WHAT -- THAT'S WHAT WE ARE VOTING ON.
01:02:10.293: >> IF THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU --
01:02:13.830: >> Chair Milshteyn: MR. MOORE. MICROPHONE.
01:02:17.167: >> IF THAT'S YOUR ONLY OPTION, YES, PLEASE VOTE.
01:02:19.970: >> Commissioner Abrons:  OKAY. THERE WOULD BE AN OPTION TO TABLE, POTENTIALLY. RIGHT?
01:02:27.444: >> YOU STILL COULDN'T CHANGE THIS.
01:02:29.980: >> Commissioner Abrons: RIGHT. THE NUMBER IS WHAT THE NUMBER IS. I SUPPOSE IT WOULD GIVE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PETITIONER TO -- YEAH. THAT DOESN'T -- OKAY. SO I'M ONE OF THE NEW FACES THAT YOU REFERRED TO EARLIER. I WASN'T HERE THE FIRST TIME THAT THIS CAME BEFORE THE COMMISSION AND I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO SORT THROUGH THE BACK STORY AND I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY THAT THERE'S A LOT OF TALK TONIGHT ABOUT C1A BUT C1A IS NOT ON THE TABLE AND IT'S CURRENTLY C1B AND THE REASON WHY C1B IS INSUFFICIENT WAS NOT ADDRESSED AND IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE IS A BUILDING HEIGHT LIMIT OF 50 FEET AND 4 STORIES AND THE APPLICATION FOR THE PUD IS SO THAT YOU CAN BUILD A TALLER BUILDING; IS THAT CORRECT?
01:03:16.593: >> AND THE -- AND THE LIMIT ON THE TOTAL FLOOR AREA. SO WE --
01:03:22.132: >> Commissioner Abrons:  AT 150 INSTEAD OF 200.
01:03:26.336: >> SO THOSE TWO PARAMETERS, UNLESS JOE HAS OR INPUT, THOSE ARE THE OTHER PARAMETERS.
01:03:34.811: >> AND SETBACKS.
01:03:35.678: >> Commissioner Abrons:  IS IT SAFE TO ASSUME THAT WITH THOSE REVICKIONS, THE DEVELOP -- RESTRICTIONS BEING ARE THE DEVELOPER WOULD NOT BUILD THIS PROJECT?
01:03:45.188: >> CORRECT.
01:03:45.522: >> Commissioner Abrons:  OKAY. THAT'S IT FOR NOW. THANKS.
01:03:51.928: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN.
01:03:52.862: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANKS. A QUESTION FOR MS. THATCHER. ON NOVEMBER 4th OF LAST YEAR, CITY COUNCIL PASSED A SET OF ZONING REFORMS AIMED AT HELPING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THE PUD CHANGING THE FORMULA WAS ONE OF THOSE. ALSO IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT ORDINANCE, WE TALKED ABOUT ALLOWING PROJECTS THAT WERE ALREADY IN THE PIPELINE TO CONTINUE WITH REGULATIONS AS THEY EXISTED PRIOR TO NOVEMBER 4.
01:04:23.393: >> YES.
01:04:24.127: >> Councilmember Ackerman: WOULD THIS BE INCLUDED IN THAT?
01:04:25.829: >> IT WOULD NOT. WE FIGURED IT OUT TODAY AND EMAILED IT TO THE PETITIONERS, BUT THE EFFECTIVE DATE WAS 10 OR 15 DAYS -- THERE WAS AN EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE ORDINANCE. THERE WAS A NUMBER OF DAYS WITHIN THAT DATE WHICH YOU COULD -- DO YOU HAVE THE EMAIL?
01:04:46.950: >> I DON'T.
01:04:47.750: >> OKAY. IT DOESN'T -- IT DOESN'T MEET THE BANDWIDTH THAT CITY COUNCIL LAID OUT FOR PROJECTS THAT WERE ALREADY IN THE WORKS?
01:04:57.794: >> Councilmember Ackerman: WHEN WAS THIS SUBMITTED?
01:05:00.497: >> NOVEMBER 20.
01:05:00.897: >> SO LET ME JUST ADDRESS DATES, RIGHT? SO WE HAD A PRESUBMITTAL MEETING WITH STAFF ON THE 23rd OF AUGUST. THEN TO SET UP THE PREPETITION CONFERENCE BEFORE THIS BODY WHICH WAS THE NEXT STEP ON THE PUD, ON THE 15th OF OCTOBER AND THEN WITH THE BLESSING OF BOTH THE STAFF AND THIS BODY, WE THEN SUBMITTED THE APPLICATION FOR SITE PLAN APPROVAL AND REZONING IN NOVEMBER 19th, I THINK IT WAS. I THINK THAT THE DATE OF THE ADOPTION OF THE CHANGE OR CLARIFICATION DEPENDING UPON THE SEMANTICS OF CALCULATION OF THE FORMULA HAPPENED BETWEEN THE PREPETITION CONFERENCE THAT WE HAD HERE AND THE FORMAL APPLICATION. SO IT REALLY DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU DEFINE AS "THE PIPELINE" BECAUSE THERE'S NO WAY TO GET TO THAT APPLICATION PROCESS UNTIL YOU DO THOSE OTHER TWO FIRST STEPS. SO WE ACTUALLY BEGAN THE STEPS IN AUGUST. AND THEN THE NEXT STEP WAS IN OCTOBER, AND THE FINAL STEP WAS IN -- A DATE IN NOVEMBER, WHICH WAS AFTER TIME WHEN THE COUNCIL CHANGED OR CLARIFIED THE FORMULA. WHEN YOU ARE IN THE PIPELINE IS WHAT?
01:06:16.372: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANKS FOR THE CLARIFICATION. THAT'S REALLY UNFORTUNATE. [ LAUGHTER ]
01:06:24.414: >> AMONG THE LONG LIST.
01:06:25.915: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THAT'S REALLY UNFORTUNATE AND FRUSTRATING. THIS IS A GOOD PROJECT. AND NEIGHBORS LIKE IT. I THINK IF WE VOTE TO RECOMMEND THIS, MS. THATCHER, IS THERE ANY WAY THAT WE CAN GIVE DIRECTION BETWEEN NOW AND WHEN IT APPEARS ON THE CITY COUNCIL AGENDA TO GET CLOSER TO 88,200 NUMBER? I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S BY REEXAMINING SUBMISSION DATE AND WHEN THAT IS. I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY THE BEST LEGAL ROUTE. BUT --
01:07:05.288: >> YEAH, WE LOOKED AT THAT. WE ARE HAPPY TO GO OVER IT WITH THE CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE AND GET THEIR OPINION ON IT BEFORE IT COMES BACK. IT MAY BE A DIFFERENCE IN DEFINITIONS OF WHEN A PROJECT IS ACCEPTED.
01:07:24.240: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YEAH, I DON'T WANT TO OPEN THE FLOODGATE TO EVERY SINGLE PETITIONER IN TOWN SAYING THAT THEY CAN EXIST UNDER THE OLD ZONING CODE, BECAUSE IT'S MUCH MORE PERMISSIVE WHEN IT COMES TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING, BUT THIS -- THIS IS REALLY UNFORTUNATE. SO I THINK MY PREFERENCE WOULD BE IF WE DO -- I MEAN EITHER WAY WE WILL MOVE THIS FORWARD, EITHER AS A DENIAL OR A -- OR A RECOMMENDATION OF DENIAL OR APPROVAL. I THINK SOME DIRECTION ALSO TO STAFF TO SPEAK WITH THE CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE TO TRY TO GET CLOSER TO THAT 88200 AS GOVERNED BY LAW PRIOR TO NOVEMBER 4th.
01:08:11.187: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER MILLS?
01:08:13.890: >> Vice Chair Mills: AS I SAID BEFORE, I'M TOTALLY FINE WITH THAT. LIKE, I WOULD -- THE ONLY -- THE ONLY CONCERN THAT I HAVE ABOUT SPESENDING THAT KIND OF MESSAGE OVERALL. THERE ARE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK, PARTICULARLY AS WE -- AS IT RELATES TO OUR -- OUR -- SORRY, C1A, IS ABOUT PRECEDENCE SETTING AND I WORRY ABOUT PRECEDENCE SETTING OF CHANGING THE AFFORDABILITY FORMULA. SO I -- AGAIN, I DON'T WANT LIKE -- IF THIS -- IF THIS FITS THAT LOOPHOLE, JUST RIGHT AND THIS IS THE ONE THING, I THINK -- I DON'T WANT TO STAND IN THE WAY OF THAT. I THINK THAT THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE. I WANT TO MAKE SURE, THOUGH, THAT WE KNOW WHAT OUR PUD IS ABOUT. RIGHT? AND WHAT PUD IS SUPPOSED TO BE FOR AND IF THERE ARE, AS YOU JUST RECOMMENDED -- OR AS YOU JUST NOTED, LIKE IF THERE'S -- IF WE OPEN IT TOO WIDE AND IT -- AND IT SENDS THE MESSAGE THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT CAN BE SKIRTED, THAT'S NOT WHAT PUD IS INTENDED FOR. THAT'S NOT ITS INTENTION. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT DOESN'T SET AN UNFORTUNATE PRECEDENT THERE.
01:09:38.541: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER BRIGGS.
01:09:41.611: >> Commissioner Briggs: COULD YOU JUST DESCRIBE A LITTLE BIT MORE THE -- IN TERMS OF THE PUD BENEFIT AROUND THE REMEDIATION AND KIND OF HOW THAT FACTORED INTO STAFF CONSIDERATIONS?
01:09:55.191: >> MM-HMM. SO CERTAINLY REMEDIATION IS A BENEFIT TO THE PUBLIC. IN THIS CASE, THE REMEDIATION THAT'S PROPOSED HERE IS THE SAME REMEDIATION THAT WAS PROPOSED UNDER THE PREVIOUS PLAN. THERE WAS NOT ANY ADDITIONAL BENEFIT PROVIDED BY THIS REMEDIATION OVER THAT ONE. POSSIBLY IT COULD BE DEFINED AS A PUBLIC BENEFIT, BUT THERE WASN'T ANY BACKUP INFORMATION ON THAT. SO I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW MORE IF THAT WAS GOING TO BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION FOR JUST WHAT THAT REMEDIATION MEANS. WHAT THEY ARE TAKING OUT AND HOW MUCH IT WILL COST AND THINGS LIKE THAT. AND THE OTHER THING IS STORMWATER, THE GREEN ROOF THAT'S PROVIDED IS GREAT. WE LOVE GREEN ROOFS BUT ONE OF THE REASONS IT'S BEING PROVIDED IS TO MEET THE MINIMUM THRESHOLD TO ARE STORMWATER, BECAUSE THIS SITE -- IT CAN'T UTILIZE INFILTRATION BECAUSE OF THE CONTAMINANTS BECAUSE IT CAN'T GO THROUGH THE GROUND AND THEY ARE CHOOSING TO DO IT THROUGH THE GREEN ROOF. SO THAT ONE CAN'T REALLY BE COUNTED AS AN ADDITIONAL BENEFICIAL EFFECT OF THE PROJECT BECAUSE IT'S MEETING THE STANDARD THAT'S REQUIRED BY CODE.
01:11:20.810: >> Commissioner Briggs: IF THIS HAD BEEN THE FIRST TIME YOU HAD SEEN THIS PROJECT, IF YOU DIDN'T SEE THIS COME IN UNDER A DIFFERENT REQUEST PREVIOUSLY, HOW WOULD REMEDIATION GENERALLY BE TREATED? I MEAN, IS THIS -- I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THIS FROM A PRECEDENCE SETTING PERSPECTIVE. IT SEEMS LIKE THE LARGEST PUBLIC BENEFIT WITH THIS PROJECT, AND SO I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND BETTER HOW YOU THINK THROUGH THIS PROCESS?
01:11:48.571: >> YEAH, CERTAINLY IF REMEDIATION WERE PROPOSED AS A PUD BENEFIT AND MORE INFORMATION WITH ARE SUPPLIED ABOUT THAT, IT WOULD NOT BE ME WHO IS REVIEWING THAT INFORMATION, FOR ONE THING.
01:11:59.982: >> Commissioner Briggs: OKAY.
01:12:00.616: >> IT WOULD BE SOMEBODY FROM THE CITY ENVIRONMENTAL STAFF, PERHAPS. WHO WOULD GIVE US FEEDBACK ON WHO HAS BEEN PROPOSED AND THE MERITS OF THAT, AND SO IF THIS WERE A FIRST-TIME PROJECT THAT IS THE SORT OF THING THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED. ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU WANT TO KEEP IN MIND THAT IF THERE IS PARKING REQUIRED, AND THEY CHOOSE TO PUT IT SOMEWHERE, AT SOME POINT, IT'S TOUGH TO CALL THAT VOLUNTARY REMEDIATION. WELL, NO, ACTUALLY, IT'S A TIGHT ROPE THAT YOU WALK THERE. WHAT WILL THEY HAVE TO DO ANYWAY? AND WHAT IS REALLY GOING ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT AN AVERAGE SITE PLAN WOULD HAVE TO REQUIRE.
01:12:52.935: >> Commissioner Briggs: RIGHT.
01:12:53.569: >> TO PROVIDE.
01:12:55.271: >> Commissioner Briggs: GREAT. WOULD YOU LIKE TO ELABORATE.
01:12:57.106: >> WE CAN EASILY DO THE PROJECT WITHOUT THE GREEN ROOF. WE CAN HANDLE OUR STORMWATER RETENTION IN A SUBTERRANEAN TANK THAT WAS ABOVE A LEVEL WHERE THIS REMEDIATION COULD HAVE OCCURRED AND IT BE SEALED. WE DID THAT TYPE OF STORMWATER MANAGEMENT ON THE YARD, ON SOUTH MAIN STREET BUT THAT WAS ALSO A CONTAMINATED SITE. YOU CANNOT INFILTRATE BECAUSE OF CONTAMINATION. YOU JUST OVERSIZE. IN TOO FACT WE EVALUATED THE OPPORTUNITY OF NOT PUTTING THE GREEN ROOF ON AND SAVING THE COST OF ALL OF THAT AND DOING AN UNDERGROUND TANK. WE ACTUALLY ARE DOING SOMETHING OVER AND ABOVE.
01:13:35.778: >> Commissioner Briggs: OKAY. DID YOU DISCUSS THE REMEDIATION?
01:13:38.047: >> YES, SO THE CONTAMINATED SOILS WILL BE REMOVED DOWN TO A LEVEL BELOW THE FOUNDATION SYSTEM, AND THEN BELOW THAT, IS A -- A MAT, IF YOU WILL, THE PERVIOUS MATERIAL, CRUSHED STONE, WHICH HAS VENTILATION PIPES IN IT AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT, YOU PUT A BARRIER THAT'S IMPERVIOUS NOT GASES THAT MIGHT COME OUT AND ALSO WATER THAT MIGHT LEACH DOWN AND FORCE THE CONTAMINATION ELSEWHERE AND YOU HAVE THE BARRIER INSTALLED BELOW THE BUILDING LEVEL AND THEN YOU CONSTRUCT THE FOOTINGS AND THE BUILDING AND THEN YOU BRING IN CLEAN SOIL TO PUT AROUND THE BUILDING, PLANTING NEW PLANTS IN SO THAT CONTAMINATION DOESN'T FIND ITS WAY OFF THE SITE ANYMORE, BECAUSE THERE'S NO HYDROSTATIC PRESSURE TO PUSH IT AWAY ON THE NEIGHBORING PROPERTIES OR DOWNGRADIENT TO THE RIVER. SO IT -- IT DOES OFFER THAT BENEFIT TO THE PUBLIC.
01:14:34.270: >> Commissioner Briggs: IS THIS REMEDIATION THAT WOULD INTO ED TO BE DONE IF THIS PROJECT WAS SOMETHING ENTIRELY DIFFERENT? YOU KNOW, FOR EXAMPLE -- SINCE I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS PROCESS PARTICULARLY WELL, IF YOU COULD TALK ME THROUGH ANOTHER TYPE OF PROJECT THAT WOULDN'T REQUIRE THIS REMEDIATION? BRIEFLY.
01:14:49.952: >> WELL, IF WE PROPOSED NONRESIDENTIAL USES, THE LEVELS OF REMEDIATION ARE MUCH LOWER THAN PLACES WHERE PEOPLE WERE GOING TOIVE THERE. IF WE CHOSE A NONRESIDENTIAL, THE AMOUNT OF REMEDIATION IS --
01:15:06.435: >> Commissioner Briggs: YES.
01:15:07.036: >> IT HAS A COMMERCIAL ZONING, OFFICES, STORES, GAS STATIONS, PROBABLY DISPENSERRIES. [ LAUGHTER ] SO IT HAS A NON- -- IT HAS A ZONING WHICH PERMITS NONRESIDENTIAL AND THEREFORE, A LOWER LEVEL OF CLEANUP.
01:15:25.654: >> Commissioner Briggs: GREAT. THANK YOU. AS WE ALL ARE DOING, THANK YOU FOR BEING BACK HERE. I KNOW THIS IS A DIFFICULT SITUATION THAT EVERYBODY IS IN, AND ONCE AGAIN, FOR THOSE WHO HAVE SPOKEN TO US TONIGHT, ITS ALREADY BEEN SAID BUT I REALLY THINK STAFF IS STUCK IN AN AWKWARD PLACE AND I REALLY DON'T THINK THAT THEY DESERVE ANY GRIEF FOR THIS. THEY ARE DOING THEIR BEST TO IMPLEMENT THE POLICY THAT HAS BEEN SET BY CITY COUNCIL AND ALSO TO FOLLOW THOSE DIRECTIVES. AND THIS WAS APPROVED -- YOU KNOW, IT CAME WITH A STAFF RECOMMENDATION OF APPROVAL. OUR BODY HAS ALREADY APPROVED IT ONCE. IT'S BEING SENT BACK TO CONSIDER UNDER A DIFFERENT -- AS A PUD AND THAT COMES WITH THE REQUIREMENTS AND SO I APPRECIATE THE VERY DIFFICULT PLACE THAT THEY ARE IN. AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH, JILL, FOR BEING WILLING TO GO THROUGH THIS AGAIN AS WELL. THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT CITY COUNCIL WASN'T POTENTIALLY RIGHT TO SEND IT BACK, IF THEY BELIEVED THAT IT WAS NOT THE APPROPRIATE ZONING CATEGORY. HOWEVER, I -- IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE'S ENOUGH PUBLIC BENEFIT IN TERMS OF THE REMEDIATION, AND THE MORE INFORMATION I'M GETTING ON THE GREEN ROOF, IT SOUNDS LIKE MAYBE MORE INFORMATION WOULD BE WARRANTED AS IT MOVES FORWARD AS WELL TO HELP ELABORATE ON THOSE BENEFITS, MORE SUBSTANTIALLY AS WE LOOK FORWARD TO CITY COUNCIL AS A WHOLE IF IT DOES. BUT I -- STAFF HAS A CERTAIN CALCULATION THAT THEY ARE REQUIRED TO USE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND SO THAT'S -- UNLESS THERE'S SOME OTHER FORMULA THAT GETS WORKED OUT THAT SEEMS PRO ENTER AND THAT WAS THE CONSEQCONSEQUENCE OF SENDING IT.
01:17:26.508: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL.
01:17:29.979: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: THE OTHER THING THAT I TEND TO THINK THAT WE THINK OF GREEN ROOFS AS POLLINATOR OPPORTUNITY AND THEY ARE COOLER BUT ACTUALLY A MASSIVE THING THAT I THINK WE SHOULD CONSIDER FOR OTHER FUTURE POTENTIAL STORMWATER MANAGEMENT AND ZONING IN THE DOWNTOWN, IS THAT THEY ARE AMAZING AT INSULATING. AND I WOULD SUGGEST YOU FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU ARE SAVING IN TERMS OF YOUR ENERGY COST AND EFFICIENCIES IN THIS NEXT STEP, SHOULD IT HAPPEN. BECAUSE THEY REALLY ARE QUITE INCREDIBLE FOR THAT, AND THAT COMPLETELY ALIGNED WITH WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO FOR OUR CARBON NEUTRALITY GOALS. AND I APPLAUD YOU FOR USING IT ON THIS BUILDING AND I HOPE THAT OTHER PEOPLE HEAR THIS AND THINK ABOUT USING IT ON THEIR OWN, BECAUSE IT HAS SO MANY CO-BENEFITS THAT I THINK ARE REALLY IMPORTANT. THE OTHER PIECE IS THAT I -- IN MY MIND, I FEEL THAT THE EARLIER SUBMISSION OF THE PUD THAT CAME TO US IN SOME WAYS IS WHAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS THE DATE. BECAUSE THEY -- THEY WOULDN'T -- IF -- THAT'S REALLY THE NECESSARY FIRST STEP IN ORDER FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO MOVE ON. AND THAT THEY COULDN'T HAVE COME TO -- LIKE, IF THAT FORMULA HAD CHANGED BEFORE THEN, THEN THAT MAY HAVE HAD A DIFFERENT RESULT FOR THEM. AND SO I FEEL LIKE IT'S THAT -- AND I -- I THINK, AGAIN, WE'RE ALL IN AN AWKWARD PLACE. I ECHO EVERYTHING THAT EVERYBODY IS SAYING IN TERMS OF SUPPORTING STAFF BUT ALSO REALIZING THIS IS -- THIS IS REALLY DIFFICULT, BUT I ALSO WOULD BE CURIOUS TO KNOW IF THERE ARE TRULY OTHER PROJECTS THAT FIT THIS LOOPHOLE OR NOT, WHICH I DOUBT, IN TERMS OF JUST ALL THE ORDER OF EVENTS THAT HAVE HAPPENED WITH THIS. BUT IN MY MIND, I THINK IT'S THAT PUD MEETING WITH US, IN SOME WAYS THAT REALLY TRIGGERS SOME OF THIS, AND FOR ME, I FEEL LIKE THAT WOULD BE A REASON TO BE ABLE TO THINK ABOUT THE CALCULATIONS IN A DIFFERENT WAY BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT CLARIFIED. SO I FEEL LIKE EVERYBODY GETS TO HANG THEIR HAT IN THAT SCENARIO IN SOME WAYS, BECAUSE AGAIN, I DON'T THINK THEY WOULD HAVE COME BEFORE US, WITH THE CHANGE IN PUD IF IT WAS CLARIFIED. IT WAS UNCLEAR, PEOPLE AND IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO. AND IF THEY HAD AN EXAMPLE, AND THAT'S WHAT THEY COULD USE, THEN THAT'S WHAT THEY COULD USE. I THINK THIS IS A GOOD PROJECT. I THINK IT TOTALLY FITS IN THE AREA. I WILL BE VOTING FOR IT TONIGHT AND I FEEL LIKE THERE ARE REASONS TO DO SO.
01:20:24.520: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER SAUVE.
01:20:27.122: >> Commissioner Sauve: I WILL PIGGYBACK OFF OF THAT. LOOKING AT THE PUD, IT'S DATED OCTOBER 15th THAT THEY MET WITH THIS. SO THESE ARE NOT CASUAL DATES EITHER THAT MEET WHAT OUR PRE AND POST -- YOU KNOW THIS NEW ADOPTION IN NO O INTO THIS PROC. WE CAN ALIGN THIS THAT SETS THIS PRECEDENT. MAYBE IT'S A SMALL LOOPHOLE BUT AS LONG AS THERE'S DATES THAT STICK AND IT'S NOT ABOUT PEOPLE CASUALLY SAYING, OH, WE HAD A MEETING AT THE CITY, BUT THESE ARE SIGNED AND NOTARIZED DATES OF THE APPLICATION. THOSE SEEM LIKE A PRETTY STRICT WAY TO SAY THIS WAS BEFORE VERSUS AFTER. SO I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN STAFF KIND OF REEVALUATING WHAT THOSE FIXED DATES ARE ALONG THE WAY AND HOW THEY ARE REVIEWED. I KNOW YOU CAN, LIKE, POSTMARK A POSTCARD FOR WHEREVER YOU WANT AND SEND IT TODAY OR TOMORROW, BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN DATES THAT ARE KIND OF SET HERE. THOSE M POST MARKS ARE FEDERALLY STAMPED. THEY ARE REGULATED AS WELL. I'M ON BOARD WITH LOOKING AT THOSE DATES AND FIGURING OUT THE SWEET SPOT FOR WHAT WE ARE SETTING AS A PREC PRECEDENT. AND I'M NOT INTERESTED IN NEGOTIATING BETWEEN THE $88,000 AND THE $200,000. WHATEVER THAT EQUATION IS THAT'S WHAT I'M INTERESTED IN SEEING HAPPEN. SO I'M INTERESTED -- I'M VOTING TONIGHT FOR THIS TO MOVE FORWARD. I KNOW THAT WE ARE AT THE HIGHER END OF THE NUMBER, BUT REALLY WHAT I'M -- I WOULD BE VOTING FOR IS THAT THE MATH BE APPLIED APPROPRIATELY FOR THAT AFFORDABLE HOUSING. YEAH, I DO -- LIKE, STAFF IS IN A SITUATION WHERE LOOKING AT C1A, YOU KNOW, WAS ON THE TABLE. IT WAS EVALUATED TO NOT FIT BECAUSE C1A IS NOT AN APPROPRIATE ZONING EVERYWHERE IN THE CITY, AND SO THE AGENDA THAT IS THE CITY STAFF HAD WAS TO THEN LOOK AT WHAT IS APPROPRIATE AND NOT. IF IT'S NOT TO DETER ANY OTHER EFFORTS IN THE CITY, I BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE JUST TRYING TO LOOK AT THINGS APPROPRIATELY AND NOT IN ANY SORT OF CONTEXT. SO I THINK -- ACTUALLY, MY BIGGEST -- MY BIG QUESTION IS PUDs, WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THIS TYPE OF ZONING OR IF WE ARE APPLYING ZONING FOR A MASTER PLAN AND IF, LIKE, A ZONING AREA IN THE FUTURE THROUGH A MASTER PLAN HAPPENED AND THE PUD MATCHED THAT, LIKE, WHAT'S A RETROACTIVE PUD FALLING INTO A ZONING DISTRICT OR IS IT ALWAYS A PUD?
01:23:15.123: >> IT R REMAINS THAT PUD ZONING DISTRICT UNTIL IT'S REZONED TO ANOTHER PUD ZONING DISTRICT OR -- A DIFFERENT ZONING DISTRICT. IF THIS BUILDING WAS BUILT UNDER A PUD ZONING ORDINANCE, AND THEN 30 YEARS FROM NOW, THE SITE WAS TO BE REDEVELOPED, AND SOMEONE ON WWANTED TO CLEAR THE LAND AND CHANGE THE ZONING TO R1Z, FUTURE ZONING DISTRICT, THEY COULD DO THAT.
01:23:47.689: >> Commissioner Sauve: WHAT IF THEY WANTED TO -- WHAT IF LIKE THROUGH THE MASTER PLANNING PROCESS, WE PUT A ZONING IN THIS AREA THAT WOULD HAVE MAPPED OVER THE PUD AND IT'S A NEW ZONING AND SO IT'S, SAY 250% F.A.R. AND THE SETBACKS AND EVERYTHING MATCH AND THIS PROPERTY COULD COME BACK TO ADD AN ADDITIONAL FLOOR AND THEN OPT TO ZONE IN WITH THAT BUILDING OR SOMETHING?
01:24:12.948: >> SO THE SAME THING WOULD STILL APPLY, THE PUD ZONING DISTRICT WOULD HAVE TO BE AMENDED, BUT THE MASTER PLAN PROCESS WILL FIGURE OUT FUTURE LAND USES AND SENSSENSITY -- DENSITIES THAT AE APPROPRIATE AND IF IT'S DIFFERENT FOR THIS AREA THAN THE PUD, THE ZONING WOULD NOT BE IMMEDIATELY CHANGED TO MATCH THAT.
01:24:33.669: >> RIGHT.
01:24:33.969: >> Commissioner Sauve: BUT IF THE MASTER PLAN CALLED FOR AN APPROPRIATE ZONING, THERE WOULD BE AN APPROPRIATE ZONING CATEGORY, THIS COULD THEN REZONE INTO THAT APPROPRIATE THING FROM A PUD?
01:24:45.113: >> POSSIBLY BY UNDERTAKING THE ENTIRE PUD PROCESS OVER AGAIN. YEAH.
01:24:50.285: >> Commissioner Sauve: I'M JUST THINKING OF, LIKE, WHY THIS DOESN'T FIT IN ANY SORT OF ZONING RIGHT NOW. IF IT FIT THAT SOME SORT OF ZONING CATEGORY WE HAD AND WHY WE ARE AT THE PUD STATE AND THEN WHAT THE FUTURE OF THE SITE IS, RIGHT, AND THE PRECEDENT OF, OH, WE ARE SO CLOSE TO HAVING A ZONING CATEGORY AND WE HAVE TO PUD IT. I DON'T THINK THAT'S A DETRIMENT TO MOVING THIS PROJECT FORWARD, I THINK THIS IS A GOOD PROJECT, BUT IT IS ONE OF THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT IF WE'RE RIGHT ON THE EDGE OF A ZONING CATEGORY, MEETING SOMETHING, AND THEN SWITCHING INTO A PUD, I THINK THAT'S WHERE STAFF HAS LED TO THAT DENIAL. SO JUST UNDERSTANDING THAT MORE.
01:25:36.198: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER MILLS.
01:25:38.633: >> Vice Chair Mills: I PROMISE THIS IS THE LAST TIME. THIS IS WHY I REALLY APPRECIATE, LIKE ALL THE COMMISSIONERS HERE BECAUSE I THINK YOU BRING UP IDEAS THAT ARE REALLYOFANTASTIC. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT COMMISSIONER SAUVE'S QUESTIONS BROUGHT UP IN MY MIND AND I THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT TO SEND ALONG IS THAT IF THIS DOES GET REZONED -- IF IT -- YOU KNOW, REGARDLESS OF WHAT THIS BODY DOES, RIGHT, IT'S UP TO CITY COUNCIL TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO REZONE THIS, BUT IF CITY COUNCIL REZONES IT AS THE PUD, WITH THE CALCULATION TOWARDS AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT THEY CAN'T AFFORD, NOTHING CAN BE DEVELOPED ON THIS, EXCEPT FOR EXACTLY WHAT WE SEE BECAUSE THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT FOR BETTER OR WORSE, YOU GET WITH A PUD IS ONLY EXACTLY WHAT YOU SEE. I THINK THAT'S -- JUST LET THE NOTES REFLECT THAT IT'S REALLY, REALLY IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT. AND THAT IS NOT THE CASE IN OUR STANDARD DISTRICTS. I THINK THAT'S AMONG THE REASONS THAT OUR ZONING ORDINANCE SAYS IT SHOULD ONLY BE ZONED AS A PUD, IF IT CAN'T FIT IN ONE OF THE OTHER DISTRICTS BECAUSE COMMISSIONER SAUVE OFTEN TALKS ABOUT ADAPTIVE REUSE AND THAT'S NOT DOABLE IN THE PUD.
01:27:05.687: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT.
01:27:08.323: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I UNDERSTAND THIS. IF WE APPROVE THIS, AND THE CITY COUNCIL APPROVES THIS AND IT BECOMES A PUD BUT IT'S NOT BUILT, THE ONLY THING THAT COULD BE BUILT IS THIS, EXCEPT IF THEY RESTART THIS WHOLE PROCESS?
01:27:24.306: >> THAT'S CORRECT.
01:27:24.773: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: OKAY. GOING BACK TO THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING DISCONNECT, WHAT WAS THE GRACE PERIOD THAT YOU MENTIONED AFTER NOVEMBER 4th THAT WE'RE WITHIN JUST A FEW DAYS OF?
01:27:39.888: >> SO THE CITY COUNCIL AAMENDMENT ADOPTED ON NOVEMBER 4 SAYS SITE PLAN RECEIVES AND ACCEPTED BY THE AND CURRENTLY UNDER REVIEW OF THE CITY AS OF THE PUBLICATION OF THIS ORDINANCE SHALL BE EXEMPT FROM THE TERMS EVER THIS AND SHALL BE REVIEWED UNDER ALL ORDINANCES AS OF THE PUBLICATION OF THIS ORDINANCE. SO THE ORDINANCE WAS PUBLISHED ON NOVEMBER 7, AND THE GARNET PUD APPLICATION WAS SUBMITTED ON NOVEMBER 20. IT WAS UPLOADED TO TRACK IT AND ACCEPTED FOR REVIEW SOMETIME AFTER THAT. ARE.
01:28:13.555: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: OKAY. I DO AGREE WITH EVERYBODY UP HERE, THOUGH, THAT RELOOKING AT THOSE DATES, I ASSUME THAT THE $88,000 WAS ASSUMED BY PETITIONER BECAUSE OF THINGS THAT HAPPENED WHILE THEY WERE IN THE PROCESS AND I WOULD VERY MUCH SUPPORT GOING BACK TO LOOK AT THAT AND I G I AGREE THAT WEI MEAN, I DON'T -- I WOULD ASSUME THAT IF YOU KNEW THEY WERE GOING TO GO THROUGH ALL OF THIS AND HAD TO PAY $279,000 WHEN YOU INITIALLY APPLIED FOR THIS, THINGS WOULD HAVE BEEN VASTLY DIFFERENT FOR THIS PROJECT. AND I ALSO -- I WAS NOT HERE AT THE INITIAL C1A APPROVAL BUT I FOLLOWED ALONG AND I WAS HERE IN OCTOBER AND I ALSO THINK THAT THIS IS A GREAT PROJECT AND I WOULD LIKE TO FIND A WAY TO GET THIS BUILT. I'M NOT SURE I LOVE THE GREEN, BUT THAT'S OKAY.
01:29:15.417: >> I HAVE BEEN OLD TO, I CAN'T DO AMAZING BLUE EITHER. [ LAUGHTER ]
01:29:19.554: >> THAT WOULD NOT LOOK GOOD AT ALL. ONE THING I WANTED TO CLARIFY WITH YOU, YOU SAID YOU COULD DO A STORMWATER TANK IN THE GARAGE AND THEN ABOVE AND BEYOND THAT. ARE YOU DOING A TANK IN THE GARAGE OR NO?
01:29:32.867: >> NO. I SAID WE COULD DO UNDERGROUND DETENTION TANK IN LIEU OF THE GREEN ROOF.
01:29:41.343: >> THEN IF YOU DO BOTH --
01:29:43.511: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: I'M TRYING TO THINK OF WAYS THAT COULD BE ADDITIONAL BENEFITS IF IT CAME TO THAT. AND THE THING THAT I GUESS I'M STRUGGLING WITH A LITTLE BIT IS THAT WE APPROVE A PUD, WHEN THERE'S NO OTHER ZONING CATEGORY. STAFF IS SAYING BUT THERE IS ANOTHER ZONING CATEGORY BUT THE CITY COUNCIL IS SAYING WE ARE NOT GOING TO USE IT AND WE THROW THAT OUT AND IT DOESN'T EXIST AND BECAUSE THERE IS NO C1A, IT HAS TO BE A PUD? I GUESS THAT'S WHAT WE ARE SAYING? OKAY. THIS IS OBLIGATED. I FEEL FOR YOU GUYS BUT I ALSO LAP TO SUPPORT THIS PROJECT AND I REALLY HOPE THERE'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DO ABOUT THAT FEE.
01:30:28.890: >> Chair Milshteyn: SO JUST A COUPLE OF COMMENTS FROM ME. SO WHEN I GOT THE STAFF REPORT, I WAS -- YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY WHEN I READ IT AND I SAW IT DENIED, I THOUGHT I WAS READING THE WRONG DOCUMENT AT FIRST. I WAS REALLY SURPRISED BY THAT, BUT THEN FURTHER READING THE STAFF REPORT, AND UNDERSTANDING THE RATIONALE BEHIND WHY THEY DID WHAT THEY DID, I UNDERSTAND IT AND I SUPPORT IT 100%. YOU WERE PUT IN A REALLY DIFFICULT SITUATION, MS. THATCHER, AND MR. LENART, AND I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND AND I SUPPORT 100% OF THE POSITION THAT YOU HAVE TAKEN ON THIS. WITH THAT SAID, MS. ANDERSON, I'M SORRY. ON BEHALF OF ME AND ME ALONE, I'M SORRY THAT YOU ARE HERE AND YOU HAVE BEEN HERE SO MANY TIMES, AND YOU HAVE MY SINCERE, SINCERE APOLOGIES. WHAT I CAN SAY IS THAT I SUPPORTED THIS PROJECT PREVIOUSLY AND I WILL CONTINUE SUPPORTING THIS PROJECT AND I HOPE THAT CITY COUNCIL ULTIMATELY DOES SUPPORT AND I'M GOING TO THINK HAPPY THOUGHTS BETWEEN NOW AND THE TIME IT LANDS ON CITY COUNCIL'S TABLE, THAT THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CONTRIBUTION WILL BE WORKED OUT AND WORKED OUT IN THE FAVOR OF THE SMALLER NUMBER. SO -- BUT ON BEHALF OF ME AND ME ALONE, I'M SORRY. COMMISSIONER BRIGGS.
01:31:55.243: >> Commissioner Briggs: JUST A COUPLE MORE THINGS ON THE PUBLIC BENEFITS, JUST FOR THE FUTURE. GIVEN THE LOCATION OF THIS, I DON'T SEE -- THERE AS A LOT OF DISCUSSION IN THE ATTACHMENT ON THE PUD DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM ABOUT SORT OF THE WALKABILITY AND BIKABILITY OF THE AREA. THAT IS INHERENT IN THE LOCATION AND SO IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME TO SEE THAT AS A PUBLIC BENEFIT, ANY DEVELOPMENT THAT IS PUT INTO THAT LOCATION WILL FIT THAT AND IT'S SORT OF INHERENT IN BUILDING THESE WALKABLE/BIKABLE COMMUNITIES THAT WE HAVE AND SO THAT'S SORT THE SUBSTANCE OF THE BENEFITS AND I THINK IT'S THE NEXT PRACTICALLY -- PARAGRAPH WHICH IS NOT 50 ELABORATED ON AS MUCHS THERE, ONE THING THAT HAS NOT BEEN MENTIONED BUT IS IN THE REPORT WHICH IS NOTABLE BECAUSE WE DISCUSS IT IS THAT EACH CAR PARKING SPACE WILL BE PREPPED FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING STATIONS IN AN EFFORT TO ENCOURAGE THE USE OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT, REQUIRING IN THE FUTURE AND SO THAT'S -- THAT'S AHEAD OF THE CURVE IN THAT. SO THAT IS EXTRA, AND SOMETHING THAT IS OF PUBLIC BENEFIT. SO THANKS FOR DOING THAT AND THINKING AHEAD ON THAT RESPECT.
01:33:16.724: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER ABRONS.
01:33:18.793: >> Commissioner Abrons:  I WANTED TO ALSO SHARE THAT I SYMPATHIZE WITH ALL THE PARTIES IN THIS. IT'S INCREDIBLY COMPLEX. I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO THREAD THE NEEDLE AND I'M READING OVER AND OVER AGAIN THIS DESCRIPTION IN THE CODE ABOUT THE STANDARDS FOR PUD REVIEW, AND ANYONE WANTS TO, PAGE 202, IN THE UDC AND IT SAYS THE BENEFICIAL EFFECT FOR THE CITY SHALL BE ONE THAT COULD NOT BE ACHIEVED UNDER ANY OTHER ZONING CLASSIFICATION. AND AS FAR AS I CAN UNDERSTAND IT, THE ONE THING THAT COULD NO THE BE ACHIEVED UNDER ANY OTHER ZONING CLASSIFICATION OTHER THAN C1A WHICH HAS BEEN DENIED, IS THE DENSITY, RIGHT? SO NOT THE GREEN ROOF, I THINK NOT THE WALKABILITY. I AGREE WITH THE COMMENT ABOUT THAT. NOT THE REMEDIATION. THOSE THINGS COULD BE ACHIEVED UNDER ANOTHER ZONING CLASSIFICATION AND IT GOES ON TO SAY IT SHALL BE ONE THAT IS NOT UNDER ANY EXISTING STANDARD, OR ORDINANCE AND THAT TAKES AFFORDABLE HOUSING. I FEEL LIKE WHAT I'M LEFT WITH IS THE DENSITY AND IN MY MIND THAT IS ENOUGH AND I PLAN TO SUPPORT THE PROJECT. BUT IF I MAY BE TRYING TO OFFER CITY COUNCIL ALSO A WAY TO THREAD THE NEEDLE OR HOW THEY MIGHT CONCEIVE OF THE PUBLIC BENEFIT, THE DENSITY IS ONE, BECAUSE WE HAVE A HOUSING SHORTAGE, AND WE NEED MORE HOUSING. THANKS.
01:34:47.548: >> Chair Milshteyn: FURTHER DISCUSSION? SEEING NONE, ALL THOSE IN FAVOR PLEASE SAY AYE. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. THANK YOU. MOVING ON TO 9B, AN AMENDMENT TO CHAPTER 55 UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE, SECTIONS 5.29.6 SITE PLANS, 5.29.7 AREA PLANS AND 5.29.8 REQUIRED PLAN INFORMATION. WE WILL HEAD TO MS. THATCHER FOR A STAFF REPORT.
01:35:26.888: >> THIS ONE IS BLISSFULLY STRAIGHTFORWARD. [ LAUGHTER ] WE ARE TAKING THE REQUIREMENTS FOR SITE PLANS OUT OF THE SITE PLAN SECTION AND THE REQUIREMENTS FOR WHAT SHOWS UP ON AREA PLANS OUT OF THE AREA PLANS SECTION, AND ALL OF THE LITTLE HERE AND THERE REFERENCES TO SPECIAL EXCEPTION USES AND WHAT THEY ARE REQUIRED TO SHOW, WE ARE PUTTING IT ALL IN ONE NEW SECTION 5.28.8, REQUIRED LAP INFORMATION, WITH A NEW HANDY DANDY TABLE TELLING YOU EXACTLY WHICH SHEETS YOU WILL NEED TO PUT WITH WHICH SITE PLANS. IT DOES NOT CHANGE ANY OF THE CODE REQUIREMENTS. IT'S STRICTLY A RESHUFFLING OF THE EXISTING INFORMATION.
01:36:10.431: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU. AT THIS TIME, I WOULD LIKE TO OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING ON THIS ITEM. IF ANYONE IN THE AUDIENCE WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION, PLEASE STEP UP TO THE PODIUM. SEEING NO ONE, I WILL CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING AND I WILL READ THE MOTION. THE ANN ARBOR BE CITY PLANNING COMMISSION HEREBY RECOMMENDS THAT THE MAYOR AND THE CITY COUNCIL APPROVE AT FEBRUARY 4th, 2020, DRAFT TO AMENDMENTS TO CHAPTER 55 UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE, SECTIONS 5.29.6 SITE PLANS AND 5.29.7 AREA PLANS AND ADD A NEW WILL SECTION 5.29.8 REQUIRED PLAN INFORMATION, TO REORGANIZE CODE REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL TYPES OF SITE PLANS AND AREA PLANS. MOVED BY COMMISSIONER MILLS AND SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER SAUVE. DISCUSSION? COMMISSIONER BRIGGS?
01:37:04.452: >> Commissioner Briggs: JUST A QUICK QUESTION. I UNDERSTAND IT'S A REORGANIZATION, AND IT'S NOT CHANGING ANYTHING, BUT IF WE -- I THINK THIS CAME UP BEFORE, BUT JUST TO REFRESH MY MEMORY. IF WE WANTED TO CHANGE ANY OF THE STANDARDS THAT, FOR EXAMPLE, IT WENT INTO THE TRANSPORTATION PIECE OF IT OR SOMETHING, 40 YOW WOULD THAT -- WHAT WOULD THAT PROCESS LOOK LIKE?
01:37:22.503: >> IT'S SIMILAR TO WHAT THIS ONE IS GOING THROUGH, THE ORDINANCE REVIEW COMMITTEE AND THEN GO TO THIS BODY AND RECOMMENDATION TO CITY COUNCIL. IT WOULD CERTAINLY PROBABLY HAVE A LOT MORE DISCUSSION. BUT OTHERWISE --
01:37:39.220: >> Commissioner Briggs: ARE YOU AWARE OF, BY CHANCE, ANYTHING THAT CAME OUT OF THE TRANSPORTATION PLAN UPDATE OR ANY OF THE DISCUSSIONS THAT MIGHT INFORM WHETHER THE REQUIREMENTS THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE ARE THE APPROPRIATE ONES?
01:37:53.701: >> I'M NOT AWARE OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS.
01:37:56.370: >> Commissioner Briggs: OKAY. THANKS.
01:38:00.675: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL.
01:38:01.676: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: A HEART FELT THANK YOU TO REORGANIZATION OF ALL OF THIS. IT WAS SO SCATTERED AND CONFUSING BEFORE. AND AS SOMEBODY WHO USES IT ON THE OTHER SIDE, IT'S JUST SO WONDERFUL TO HAVE IT ALL IN ONE PLACE SO CLEARLY ORGANIZED. THANK YOU FOR YOUR EFFORTS.
01:38:23.264: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER ABRONS.
01:38:24.966: >> Commissioner Abrons:  IS IT SUPPOSED TO BE 5.29.8?
01:38:36.477: >> YES.
01:38:36.744: >> Commissioner Abrons:  THE DOCUMENT THAT WE RECEIVED SAYS 5.28.8.
01:38:42.083: >> OKAY. WE WILL FIX THAT BEFORE IT GETS TO COUNCIL. THANK YOU.
01:38:47.155: >> Chair Milshteyn: ALL THOSE IN FAVOR, PLEASE SAY AYE. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. MOVING ON TO 1780 SCIO CHURCH ROAD ANNEXATION AND ZONING FOR CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL. WE'LL BEGIN WITH A STAFF REPORT.
01:39:03.504: >> THIS IS A VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD REZONING AND ANNEXATION. SORRY, IT'S -- I DON'T MEAN TO BE HARPING ON THE STRAIGHTFORWARD STUFF. JUST TRYING TO GET ANY SLID SHOW TO PLAY BUT MY MOUSE IS -- IS BEHAVING BADLY. I WILL JUST TALK ABOUT IT. IT'S A .74-ACRE SITE THAT'S CURRENTLY IN THE TOWNSHIP, ON EAST SCIO ROAD, AND IT'S 2574 SQUARE FOOT HOUSE ON THE LOT WHICH IS SEWE IS SUPPOSED TO BED TO RESIDENTIAL. IT HAS A HOUSE. IT'S A PRETTY LARGE LOT. ALL AROUND IT IS RESIDENTIAL AND THE ZONING MAP AND EVERYTHING IN HERE IS R1C, UNTIL YOU GET DOWN TO THE PUBLIC LAND. THE WEST AREA PLAN RECOMMENDS RESIDENTIAL USE FOR THE SITE. 50 FEET OF THE RIGHT-OF-WAY FOR SCIO CHURCH ROAD, AS MEASURED FROM THE CENTERLINE WILL HAVE TO BE GRANTED TO THE CITY, IN A MANNER DETERMINED BY THE CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. THAT'S PRETTY STANDARD. A LOT OF TOWNSHIP LOTS WERE DRAWN TO THE CENTER LINE OF THE ROAD INSTEAD OF OUTSIDE THE RIGHT-OF-WAY AND STAFF SUPPORTS THE PROPOSED R1C ZONING BECAUSE IT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE SURROUNDING LAND USES AND THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE WEST AREA PLAN.
01:40:33.261: >> Chair Milshteyn: AT THIS TIME, I WOULD LIKE TO OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING. ANYONE WHO WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION, PLEASE STEP UP T TO THE PODIUM AND YOU HAVE THREE MIN DOLLARS TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
01:40:49.010: >> HELLO. I THINK I'M THE PETITIONER. I'M SARAH LORENZ. MY HUSBAND AND I OWN THIS PROPERTY. WE HAD BEEN TOLD THAT THIS WOULD BE ANNEXED AUTOMATICALLY IN AUGUST UNDER -- WITH A LARGE NUMBER OF PARCELS THAT WERE SUPPOSED TO BE AUTOMATICALLY ANNEXED AND THEN ALL KINDS OF INTERESTING THINGS HAPPENED WHERE PEOPLE APPARENTLY PUT UP A HUGE HUMAN CRY ABOUT THEIRS HAPPENING TO THEIRS AND WE WERE LOOKING FORWARD TO OURS BEING ANNEXED AUTOMATICALLY AND FREE AND SO INSTEAD, IT WAS NOT ANNEXED AND SO NOW WE WILL PAY THE $1,500 AND HOPE THAT IT WILL BE ANNEXED NOW SO THAT WE CAN BUILD A HOUSE.
01:41:38.059: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU.
01:41:39.093: >> THANK YOU.
01:41:39.460: >> Chair Milshteyn: IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION IN REGARDS TO THIS ITEM? SEEING NO ONE, I WILL CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING AND I WILL READ THE MOTION. THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION HEREBY RECOMMENDS THAT THE MAYOR AND THE CITY COUNCIL APPROVE THE COMPOSO ANNEXATION, MOVED BY COMMISSIONER MILLS AND SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER ABRONS. WE ARE IN DISCUSSION. COMMISSIONER MILLS -- I'M SORRY,S COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL.
01:42:09.190: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: I BEAT YOU TO IT. SO WE GOT AN INTERESTING CORRESPONDENCE AROUND THIS THING, IN TERMS OF THE NATURE OF THE TRUE PROPERTY LINE HERE. AND I'M JUST WONDERING FROM STAFF, YOU KNOW, WITH THESE ANNEXATIONS DO THEY DO A REAL DEAL BOUNDARY SURVEY WITH THIS OR IS IT SOMIN SOMETHING THAT'SN OFF THE CITY G.I.S., WITH THE REAL DEAL --
01:42:35.182: >> THEY DO A REAL BOUNDARY SURVEY AND THE FENCE DID SHOW UP ON THE NEIGHBOR'S PROPERTY WHO WROTE THE LETTER.
01:42:43.057: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: OKAY. WHAT THE NEIGHBOR IS SAYING, IS HE CORRECT IN THAT IT LOOKS LIKE THEY OWN MORE PROPERTY THAN WHAT APPEARS IF YOU ARE SITTING THERE ARE ON THE LAND BECAUSE THIS FENCE OFTEN SITS RIGHT ON THE PROPER LINE? YES, THAT'S VERY LIKELY. YEAH. I HAVEN'T BEEN OUT THERE MYSELF, BUT, YEAH, IF THE FENCE IS TOO FAR BACK ON THE NEIGHBOR'S PROPERTY, THEN BRETT LENART CORRESPONDED WITH THE NEIGHBORS ABOUT THINGS THEY COULD DO TO TOO I TO ADDRESS THAT AND WORKING WITH THE PROPERTY OWNERS AND COMING TO SOME RESOLUTION ABOUT EITHER WHO OWNS THE FENCE OR MOVING IT OR -- I'M NOT SURE WHAT THEY DESIRE THE OUTCOME TO BE. BUT IT'S -- IT'S NOT THAT THERE'S MORE PROPERTY, THAT THEY ARE SOMEHOW GETTING BY HAVING A FENCE ON THE NEIGHBOR'S PROPERTY.
01:43:32.740: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: SO IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND COMING BACK UP AGAIN. SO YOU ARE AWARE OF THIS DISCREPANCY THAT THE NEIGHBOR IS BRINGING UP THEN.
01:43:41.081: >> SO WE PURCHASED PROPERTY ON A LAND CONTRACT AND THE PEOPLE THAT WE PURCHASED IT FROM SAID THERE WAS AN OLDER COMPLAINT FROM A NEIGHBOR ABOUT A FENCE AND SO I DON'T -- DO YOU KNOW WHEN THAT CORRESPONDENCE WAS? WAS IT MORE RECENT?
01:43:57.031: >> IT JUST CAME IN TODAY OR WHY YESTERDAY.
01:44:00.568: >> THAT'S NEW TO ME. WE HAD KNOWN THAT THERE WAS SOME, BUT WE, I THINK -- I THINK WE CAN TAKE CARE OF THAT WHEN HE WITH DO ANY CONSTRUCTION. THERE'S A VERY, VERY OLD SEPTIC FIELD THAT IS FAILING THAT IS GOING TO NEED TO BE REMOVED AND SO THERE'S A FAIR AMOUNT OF WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE THERE. SO I'M SURE WE CAN COME TO SOME RESOLUTION ABOUT THE FENCE.
01:44:21.222: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: BECAUSE THERE'S -- THERE'S -- THE NATURE OF WHAT THIS -- THE NEIGHBOR IS QUESTIONING IS THAT A PREVIOUS OWNER WAS CANTANKEROUS AND THAT KIND OF REQUIRED THEM TO BUILD A FENCE THAT WAS REALLY ON THEIR PROPERTY INSTEAD OF KIND OF ON THE LINE, BECAUSE HE ASSERTED THAT HE OWNED THAT, WHICH HE PROBABLY DIDN'T IT SOUNDS LIKE ACCORDING TO THIS, BUT IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE THIS SETTLED IN TERMS OF WHAT THE REAL DEAL PROPERTY BOUNDARY IS.
01:44:55.089: >> YES, WE HAD A STAKE SURVEY DONE. SO THERE ARE STAKES. THAT WAS JUST DONE RECENTLY.
01:45:00.995: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: OKAY. SO YOU ARE AWARE OF WHERE YOUR CORNERS ARE AND THAT SORT OF THING.
01:45:05.633: >> WE HAVE THE NEW SURVEY WITHTH
