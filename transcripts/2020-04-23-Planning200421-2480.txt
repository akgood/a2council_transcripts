00:02:15.372: >> Chair Milshteyn: DO WE HAVE APPROVAL OF THE AGENDA? ANY DISCUSSION OR CHANGES OF THE AGENDA? ARE WE DOING A ROLL CALL FOR ALL VOTES, BRETT?
00:02:24.215: >> Planning Manager:  ROLL CALLS ARE RECOMMENDED UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S ORDER:  I'M LESS CONCERNED ABOUT PROCEDURAL VOTE SUCH AS MINUTES AND AGENDA. IT WILL BE IMPORTANT TO TAKE ROLL CALL VOTES ON PETITION ITEMS.

MINUTES OF PREVIOUS MEETING BEFORE US, WE HAVE THE FEBRUARY 20th, 2020, CITY PLANNING COMMISSION MEETING MINUTES. DO WE HAVE A COMMISSIONER THAT WILL MOVE THEM. MOVED BY COMMISSIONER MILLS, SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER BRIGGS. ANY DISCUSSION OR CHANGES? SEEING NONE, ALL OF THOSE IN FAVOR, PLEASE SAY AYE. [CHORUS OF AYES]
00:03:08.726: >> Chair Milshteyn: ALL RIGHT. THEY ARE APPROVED. REPORTS FROM CITY ADMINISTRATION, CITY COUNCIL, PLANNING MANAGER, PLANNING COMMISSION OFFICERS AND COMMITTEES. WE WILL BEGIN WITH OUR CITY COUNCIL REPRESENTATIVE, COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN.
00:03:21.405: >> Councilmember Ackerman: GREAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MR. CHAIR. CITY COUNCIL HAD A LONG MEETING LAST NIGHT. I GOT OUT EARLY HOURS OF MORNING TODAY. JUST A SMALL HANDFUL OF UPDATES FOR YOU FROM THAT MEETING. WITH RESPECT TO WORK THAT WILL BE COMING OUR WAY, AT THE DIRECTION OF CITY COUNCIL, THE ANN ARBOR HOUSING COMMISSION AND THE ANN ARBOR PLANNING STAFF LED BY MR. LENART HAVE BEEN PURSUING THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING ON SEVERAL CITY OWNED SITES. OF THOSE, TWO IN PARTICULAR WERE TOPIC OF CONVERSATION LAST NIGHT, 415 WEST WASHINGTON, WHICH IS A DECOMMISSIONED ROAD COMMISSION FACILITY, ACROSS FROM THE YMCA AND 350 SOUTH 5 5th WHICH IS THE SET OF THE FORMER Y, NEXT TO THE BLAKE TRANSIT CENTER. WITH RESPECT TO -- WELL, I GUESS I SHOULD SAY FOR BOTH PROJECTS, STAFF HAS BEEN CREATIVE IN PROPOSING A DIFFERENT PROCESS TO MOVE FORWARD THAN WE HAVE IN PREVIOUS YEARS WITH RESPECT TO DEVELOPING PUBLICLY OWNED LAND. INTO THESE SCENARIOS, WE WOULD BE MOVING FORWARD WITH A PREENTITLEMENT, MEANING WE WILL AS A CITY, AS A COMMUNITY, BE SHAPING THE PARAMETERS UNDER WHICH WE WOULD BE COMFORTABLE SEEING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE SITES. AND AT THAT POINT, GOING TO MARKET TO FIND A DEVELOPMENT PARTNER TO CONSTRUCT IT ON OUR BEHALF. SO A LITTLE BIT OF A REVERSE KIND OF PROCESS THAT WE HAVE EXPERIENCED IN THE PAST, BUTTING THINGS OUT FOR AN -- PUTTING THINGS OUT FOR AN RFP AND SEE WHAT THE COMMUNITY BRINGS TO US. SO HOPEFULLY IT WILL DEVELOP MORE BUY-IN EARLIER IN THE PROCESS. WITH RESPECT TO 350 SOUTH 5th, WE MOVED THAT FORWARD WITH SOME EXCITEMENT. ON 415 WEST WASHINGTON, MR. LENART -- I'M SORRY, I WILL HAVE TO CALL ON YOU. DID WE VOTE TO MOVE THAT FORWARD OR POS POSTPONE IT? IT WAS SUCH A LONG MEETING.
00:05:37.775: >> I THINK 350 SOUTH MAIN WAS ENACTED. SO WE WILL PROCEED WITH THAT.
00:05:42.212: >> Councilmember Ackerman: RIGHT.
00:05:43.414: >> BUT THERE WERE SOME QUESTIONS ON 415 WEST WASHINGTON.
00:05:46.350: >> Councilmember Ackerman: AND ARE WE POSTPONING THAT FOR MORE ENGAGEMENT?
00:05:54.391: >> Planning Manager:  THE Y LOT?
00:05:57.194: >> Councilmember Ackerman: 415 WEST WASHINGTON.
00:05:59.363: >> Planning Manager:  YES, IT WILL BE POSTPONED WITH THE TREELINE CONSERVANCY AND SOME OF THE MORE IMMEDIATE NEIGHBORS AND RESIDENTS OF THAT SITE.
00:06:10.073: >> Councilmember Ackerman: AWESOME, THANK YOU. AND THEN TO CLOSE THE LOOP ON SOMETHING THAT THIS COMMISSION HAD A HAND IN, THE CREDIT UNION THAT WE REVIEWED AND RECOMMENDED APPROVAL FOR AT 2151 WEST STADIUM, THE MSGCU CREDIT UNION SITE PLANNING AND REZONE, BOTH WERE APPROVED BY CITY COUNCIL. AND THEN TURNING YOUR ATTENTION TO LONG-TERM PLANNING. LAST NIGHT, CITY COUNCIL HAD THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE FIRST TIME TO VOTE ON THE A2ZERO, ANN ARBOR CARBON NEUTRALITY PLAN WHICH IT OUR AMBITIOUS ENDEAVOR TO BRING OUR COMMUNITY AND USING THE CITY GOVERNMENT AS A LEAD AGENCY, AN ACTOR IN THAT, TO CARBON NEUTRALITY BY THE YEAR 2030. THERE WAS ROBUST DISCUSSION AND DEBATE WHICH LANDED ON MOVING THE PLAN FORWARD AND BEGINNING TO IMPLEMENT IT WHILE ALSO REQUESTING OF STAFF TO BRING BACK IN SHORT ORDER SOME MORE INFORMATION ABOUT FINANCIAL PLANNING, TO PUT SOME DOLLARS AND CENTS TO THE STRATEGIES AND THE GOALS CONTAINED IN THAT. THAT'S EVERYTHING FROM ME.
00:07:24.114: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU. MR. LENART, DO YOU HAVE A REPORT FOR US THIS EVENING?
00:07:27.584: >> Planning Manager:  JUST BRIEFLY. WE'LL GET TO UPCOMING BUSINESS PUBLIC HEARINGS SOON, BUT AT THIS POINT, WE'RE ANTICIPATING THAT FOR THE NEXT ORDINANCE REVISIONS COMMITTEE MEETING, WE WILL BE DELVING A LITTLE BIT MORE INTO PLANNED PROJECT MODIFICATIONS. SO I ANTICIPATE THAT DISCUSSION, AND WE'LL SHARE THAT -- WE'LL SHARE THAT AGENDA SHORTLY FOR THOSE ORC MEMBERS AND THE PUBLIC. THAT'S IT.
00:07:55.379: >> Chair Milshteyn: GREAT. THANKS. PLANNING COMMISSION OFFICERS AND COMMITTEES. ANY REPORTS FROM THE PLANNING COMMISSION? SEEING NO ONE, WRITTEN COMMUNICATIONS AND PETITIONS. WE HAVE RECEIVED A COUPLE OF ITEMS. THEY ARE IN OUR PACKET. SO PLEASE TAKE A LOOK AT THOSE. AND WE ARE NOW AT AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION.

SO MAYBE -- MAYBE IT'S TOO LATE TO MAKE ANY COMMENT WITH REGARD TO THAT.
00:11:43.373: >> Chair Milshteyn: SO THE MAIN STREET IS LATER ON OUR AGENDA. SO THERE WILL BE A PUBLIC STATEMENT AFTER THE STAFF REPORT. SO IF YOU WANT TO STAY, YOU CAN CALL BACK IN. WE WILL REVIEW THAT LATER ON IN THE MEETING.
00:11:57.087: >> OH, OKAY. PARDON ME. I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT THEN. YEAH, I WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT ON THAT SPECIFICALLY. THANK YOU.
00:12:04.561: >> Chair Milshteyn: THAT'S AGENDA ITEM 9-C, IF YOU ARE LOOKING AT AN AGENDA, IT WILL COME UP LATER IN THIS MEETING.
00:12:12.002: >> OKAY. THANK YOU.
00:12:13.036: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU. DO WE HAVE ANYBODY ELSE AT THIS TIME? MR. LENART?
00:12:17.474: >> Planning Manager:  JUST THAT CALLER, IT'S POSSIBLE THAT CALLER MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN THE VALHALLA PROJECT AS WELL. WELL, THAT IS ON ANN ARBOR SALIM. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE REQUESTER HAS REQUESTED POSTPONEMENT. ITS ANN ARBOR SALIM ROAD.
00:12:38.962: >> Chair Milshteyn: GOT IT AND WE WILL HAVE A PUBLIC HEARING ON THAT SHORTLY AS WELL. IS THERE ANY OTHER AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION? SEEING NONE, ALL RIGHT ALL RIGHT.
00:12:53.810: >> NO ONE ELSE? WE WILL MOVE ON TO PUBLIC HEARINGS FOR THE NEXT BUSINESS MEETING. MR. LENART?
00:13:02.185: >> Planning Manager: SCHEDULED FOR THE MAY MAY 5th PLANNING COMMISSION MEETING, WE WILL HAVE TWO SCHEDULED PUBLIC HEARINGS, ONE IS 3611 TO 3621 PLYMOUTH ROAD REZONING SITE PLAN WITH PLANNED PROJECT MODIFICATIONS AND SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE FOR A DRIVE THRU FACILITY. THIS IS A PROJECT YOU HAVE SEEN ONCE BEFORE, HOWEVER, WE HAVE RENOTICED IT IN CONFORMANCE WITH THE GOVERNOR'S NOTIC ORDERS THAT MAY BE HELD ELECTRONICALLY. IT WAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO RENOTIFY FOLKS. AND THEN SECOND, WE HAVE A SERIES OF PROPOSED UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE AMENDMENTS RELATIVE TO SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM INSTALLATION. THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS WOULD PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY AND INSTALLING NEW ACCESSORY STRUCTURES FOR THE PURPOSES OF SOLAR RENEWABLE ENERGY AND PROVIDE SOME EXCEPTIONS TO SUPPORTING THE HEIGHT LIMITS FOR THE PURPOSE OF ADDING SQUARE ADR ENERGY FOR ROOFTOPS.
00:14:05.916: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU. WE ARE ENTERING THE REGULAR BUSINESS ON OUR AGENDA. FIRST ITEM BEFORE US IS THE VALHALLA ANN ARBOR SITE PLAN ANNEXATION AND REZONING FOR CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL. THE PETITIONER HAS REQUESTED POSTPONEMENT OF THIS APPLICATION, WHICH CITY STAFF PROPOSES FOR JUNE 2nd. WHILE NO PRESENTATION WILL BE GIVEN, A PUBLIC HEARING HAS BEEN NOTICED AND WILL BE HELD FOR THIS PETITION. I'M REQUESTING A MOTION TO POSTPONE THIS PETITION TO JUNE 2nd AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE PUBLIC HEARING. AUDIENCE MEMBERS WHO ADDRESS THIS PETITION THIS EVENING WILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO SO AGAIN ON JUNE 2nd. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY -- I'M SORRY, AND NOW I WOULD LIKE TO OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PERSONS TO SPEAK UP TO THREE MINUTES ABOUT THIS APPLICATION. TO COMMENT, PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS FOR THE RECORD. PUBLIC COMMENT WILL BE MADE BY PHONE AT THE NUMBER APPEARING ON THE PUBLISHED AGENDA AND DISPLAYED ON THE MEETING'S VIDEO FEED. IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN SPEAKING AT THIS TIME, PLEASE CALL THE MEETING WITH THE INFORMATION PROVIDED. CITY STAFF WILL SELECT CALLERS THAT HAVE RAISED THEIR HAND, ONE BY ONE, USING THE LAST THREE DDIGITS OF YOUR PHONE NUMBER. IN ORDER TO ELECTRONICALLY RAISE YOUR HAND, PLEASE PRESS STAR NINE ON YOUR PHONE. THAT IS STAR NINE. YOU WILL HEAR AN ALL AUTOMATED ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE HOST HAS ALLOWED YOU TO SPEAK. WHEN SPEAKING, PLEASE MOVE TO A QUIET HERE AND MUTE ANY TV OR BACKGROUND SOUNDS SO WE CAN HEAR YOU CLEARLY. WE WILL OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING AT THIS TIME. AND THE VALHALLA PROJECT IS THE PROJECT THAT IS AT ANN ARBOR SALIM AND MAIN STREET. SOUTH MAIN STREET.
00:16:00.030: >> CALLER 094, YOU SHOULD BE LIVE.
00:16:01.831: >> ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU. MY NAME IS DARRYL FISHER. I'M AT 2251 SOUTH MAIN STREET. LET'S SEE, I'M ALSO THE ASSOCIATION PRESIDENT FOR THE LAST 15 YEARS AT THE MAIN STREET COMMONS CONDO ASSOCIATION ON MAIN STREET. SO WE WOULD BE FAIRLY CLOSE NEIGHBORS TO THE VALHALLA PROJECT, AND I GUESS GIVEN THAT I HAVE THREE MINUTES, I WILL KEEP IT. SO THAT GENERALLY SPEAKING, THERE'S A LOT OF CONCERN THAT WE ALREADY HAVE ISSUES WITH RUNOFF, FOR EXAMPLE, FROM THE GROUND -- FROM THE GOLF COURSE, THAT'S NEXT TO US, WHICH WOULD BE SEPARATING THE VALHALLA PROJECT AND WHERE WE LIVE, BUT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT WOULD BE CHALLENGING. TRAFFIC WOULD BE ONE OF THEM, WATER WOULD BE ANOTHER FACTOR TO SAY THE LEAST, BOTH ON THE SURFACE AND THROUGH THE PIPES BASICALLY. SO, YEAH, I GUESS GIVEN MY THREE MINUTES, ARE PROBABLY ABOUT UP. I WOULD SAY THAT WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THAT AND IN GENERAL, WE ARE NOT SUPER EXCITED ABOUT IT TO SAY THE LEAST. JUST TO MAKE THAT KNOWN. SO, THANK YOU.
00:17:16.940: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU VERY MUCH, AND THIS WILL BE BACK ON OUR AGENDA ON JUNE 2nd. SO YOU WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION AT THAT TIME AS WELL. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION IN REGARDS TO THIS ITEM? IF SO, PLEASE PRESS STAR NINE ON YOUR TELEPHONE. IT LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE SOMEBODY WHO HAS RAISED THEIR HAND?
00:17:50.006: >> CALLER 107, GO AHEAD.
00:17:51.040: >> GO AHEAD, STEPHANIE.
00:17:52.509: >> HI. MY NAME IS STEPHANIE SAVARINO AND I LIVE AT 117 GOLFVIEW LANE. THIS DEVELOPMENT IS CONCERNING AND COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATE FOR THIS LOCATION, IN MY OPINION. WITH THE DENSITY ZONING REQUEST OF R4E, THERE'S NO REASON FOR A HIGH-RISE IN A SINGLE FAMILY, LOW DENSITY, MULTIFAMILY NEIGHBORHOOD IN THIS LOCATION. APPARENTLY THE DEVELOPERS CAN'T ASSEMBLE THE PARCELS WITHOUT OVERPAYING FOR IT AND THE NUMBERS DON'T WORK WITHOUT REQUESTING THIS ENORMOUS ZONING OF R4E, THAT'S COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATE FOR THE AREA. I WAS ALSO ANNEXED IN ON A TOWNSHIP ISLAND, AND ADJACENT TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN GOLF COURSE, WHEN I BUILT THE HOUSE YEARS AGO AND I REQUESTED ON ONE ACRE PARCEL, R1A IN THE SAME LOCATION, BASICALLY AS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ON THIS VALHALLA DEVELOPMENT. THERE'S A MULTIFAMILY DEVELOPMENT AT SOUTH MAIN AND GOLFVIEW, WHICH WE JUST SPOKE WITH DARRYL, WHO HAD JUST BEEN ON AND THAT'S CALLED MAIN STREET COMMONS. THAT WAS NOT OPPOSED BY ANY NEIGHBORS AND CONSISTS OF 60 SIDE-BY-SIDE, AND POND FEATURE AND IT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE DENSITY OF THE AREA, AND THAT -- THE NEXT ONE IS R1C, AGAIN CONSISTENT WITH THE AREA. IF I NEED TO STOP, YOU CAN STOP ME. I'M JUST GOING TO CITE ONE THING IN THE ANN ARBOR CITY'S MASTER PLAN THAT READS IN ADDITION TO THE TYPES OF DWELLINGS ME DWELLD IN R1, R, 2THEN TO ATTACH DWELLINGS AND ONE ABOVE THE OTHER OR SIDE BY SIDE. THAT'S WHAT WE THINK IS APPROPRIATE HERE. AND THERE'S ALSO CONCERN FOR THE NATURAL FEATURES IN THE AREA THAT WILL BE COMPROMISED PERMANENTLY WITH THIS EXCESSIVE PROPOSED DENSITIES THAT THE VALHALLA DEVELOPERS ARE ASKING FOR. IN ADDITION THE ENTRANCE AT THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR FROM SOUTH WILL BE UNRECOGNIZABLE AND A TRAGEDY. AS A LIFELONG ANN ARBOR RESIDENT, I STRONGLY OBJECT TO THE INAPPROPRIATENESS AND EXCESS OF THIS ABSURD DEVELOPMENT AS PROPOSED. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR LISTENING.
00:20:06.142: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU. IS THERE NIP ELSE WHO WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION AT THIS TIME?
00:20:23.660: >> HELLO. THIS IS EAD HOLLAND. I'M STEPHANIE'S NEIGHBOR. MY BACKYARD SPACE IS THE GOLF COURSE, AND I -- I JUST WANTED TO SUPPORT EVERYTHING SHE SAID. OUR NEIGHBORHOOD GROUP IS IN AGREEMENT AT A HIGH DENSITY, TALL, PACKED STRUCTURE AS BEING PROPOSED IS NOT APPROPRIATE FOR THIS PARTICULAR SETTING. YOU DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH SOMEONE WANTING TO DEVELOP THAT PARTICULAR NEIGHBORHOOD, BUT PUTTING 500 UNITS IN A PLACE THAT CURRENTLY HAS 15 OR 16 SINGLE FAMILY HOMES IS JUST AN UNBELIEVABLE IDEA. THAT'S REALLY ALL I HAD TO SAY.
00:21:21.751: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU SO MUCH. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION IN REGARDS TO THIS PROJECT? SEEING NONE, I WILL CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING AND I WILL ASK FOR A MOTION TO POSTPONE UNTIL JUNE 2nd. DO I HAVE A COMMISSIONER THAT WILL MOVE THAT? MOVED BY COMMISSIONER MILLS, SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL. ANY DISCUSSION ON THE POSTPONEMENT?
00:22:00.189: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  DO YOU HAVE TO READ THE MOTION?
00:22:04.127: >> Chair Milshteyn: WE DON'T HAVE A MOTION.
00:22:07.663: >> Councilmember Ackerman: OH.
00:22:10.299: >> Councilmember Ackerman: MR. LENART, WE DON'T HAVE A MOTION.
00:22:15.838: >> Planning Manager:  IT WOULD JUST BE A POSTPONEMENT OF THE MOTION THAT'S PRESENTED IN -- OH, YEAH. I'M SORRY. YOU DON'T HAVE A STAFF REPORT. I WOULD JUST SUGGEST THAT THE MOTION READ THAT THE REZONING AND SITE PLAN RELATED PETITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE VALHALLA APPLICATION BE POSTPONED UNTIL JUNE 2nd.
00:22:37.493: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER MILLS AND GIBB-RANDALL, ARE YOU OKAY WITH THAT MOTION AS STATED BY MR. LENART? THANK YOU. ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION? THANK YOU, COMMISSIONER, ACKERMAN FOR THAT. SEEING NO DISCUSSION, ALL OF THOSE IN FAVOR, PLEASE SAY AYE. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? ALL RIGHT. IT IS POSTPONED. NEXT ITEM ON OUR AGENDA FOR THOSE FOLLOWING THE MEETING, IT'S 9-B, GREENHILLS SCHOOL TRACK AND FIELD SITE PLAN AND LANDSCAPE MODIFICATION FOR PLANNING COMMISSION APPROVAL.
00:23:15.198: >> Commissioner Woods: COMMISSIE THAT I HAVE HAD A RELATIONSHIP WITH GREENHILLS SCHOOL. MY CHILDREN HAVE ATTENDED THE SCHOOL, AS WELL AS GRANDCHILDREN. AND SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE COMMISSIONERS ARE AWARE OF THAT, IN CASE SOME WOULD WANT ME TO RECUSE MYSELF FROM THIS DISCUSSION AND VOTE.
00:23:33.149: >> Chair Milshteyn: DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY CONCERNS ABOUT COMMISSIONER WOODS' PARTICIPATING IN DISCUSSING AND VOTING ON ITEM?
00:23:41.324: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  IF ANYTHING, I FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE MORE CONTEXT.
00:23:45.495: >> Chair Milshteyn: ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. SO OUR -- SO THIS EVENING, WE'LL HEAR FROM THE PETITIONER. THEY WILL HAVE UP TO TEN MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION IN REGARDS TO THIS ITEM. WE WILL THEN HEAD TO MR. KAHAN FOR STAFF REPORT, AND THEN WE'LL OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING AND THEN DISCUSSION AND VOTE. SO I WILL HAND IT OFF TO THE PETITIONERS FOR THEIR REPORT AND PRESENTATION.
00:24:14.724: >> HI, I KNOW YOU TURNED IT OVER TO JEFF. MY NAME IS PETER FEROYAN, I'M THE HEAD OF GR GREENHILLS SCHOOL AND HAVE BEEN NOW FOR TWO YEARS. IN TWO DIFFERENT ESTIMATES. I WAS THE HEAD IN 2005 TO 2012 AND THEN WENT OUT EAST TO RUN A BOARDING SCHOOL AND MISSED ANN ARBOR SO MUCH, AND WAS VERY FORTUNATE TO BE REHIRED A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO TO BE THE HEAD OF GREENHILLS AGAIN. MANY OF YOU KNOW AND WENDY WE LOVE YOUR KIDS AND GRANDCHILDREN, OF COURSE. IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE TO WORK WITH THEM. GREENHILLS, AS MANY OF YOU KNOW, HAS BEEN A VITAL PART OF THE EDUCATIONAL COMMUNITY IN ANN ARBOR FOR OVER 50 YEARS. WE WERE FOUNDED IN 1968. AND SINCE THAT TIME, WE HAVE GROWN TO BE A SCHOOL OF OVER 500 STUDENTS AND 100 FACULTY AND STAFF. WE HAVE BEEN ABOUT 500 OR MORE FOR THE LAST 20 YEARS AND WE STAYED TRUE TO THE FOUNDING PRINCIPLES WHEN A GROUP OF PARENTS IN ANN ARBOR FOUNDED THE SCHOOL TO SERVE ANN ARBOR COMMUNITY TO BE COMMITTED TO KEEPING A TUITION LEVEL THAT'S STILL WITHIN RANGE OF, YOU KNOW, THE ORIGINAL BLUEPRINT WAS LOOKING AT TUITION FOR A TWO-PROFESSOR INCOME AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN. COMMITMENT TO FINANCIAL AID WHICH IS 20 TO 25% OF OUR STUDENTS ARE ON AID, ABOUT 10 TO 15% OF OUR OPERATING BUDGET. SO RIGHT NOW, IT'S $1.5 MILLION A YEAR THAT WE -- THAT WE USE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE CASTING A BROAD NET AND WE ARE PROVIDING THIS EDUCATION FOR AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE. OVER THE YEARS, WE HAVE SEEN GROWTH, OBVIOUSLY, LIKE ANY SCHOOL, WE HAD TO MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS AND I AM PROUD TO SAY THAT THE CAPITAL PROJECTS THAT WE HAVE EMBARKED UPON, WE HAVE GONE ABOUT THOUGHTFULLY. WE HAVE GONE ABOUT WITH SOME OF OUR CORE PRINCIPLES IN MIND AND MISSION TO EMPOWER STUDENTS TO BE CREATIVE, CURIOUS AND RESPONSIBLE AND WHOSE LIVES WILL BETTER THE WORLD AND PARTICULARLY WITH SUSTAINABILITY IN MIND AND COMMUNITY IN MIND. THE CAMPBELL CENTER FOR THE PERFORMING ARTS IS NOT JUST A THEATER SPACE FOR OUR OWN STUDENTS AND OWN COMMUNITY, BUT IT IS A SPACE THAT WE OPEN UP TO THE PUBLIC, THAT NONPROFITS IN THE AREA DO PROBONO. OUR TENNIS COURTS AND OUR FIELD AND OUR GROUNDS ARE PLACES WHERE OUR NEIGHBORS ENJOY. IT'S A BEAUTIFUL AREA. WE ARE SURROUNDED BY BOTH EARHART VILLAGE AND CONCORDIA AND GLACIER VILLAGE, ALL THREE ENTERPRISES ARE PLACES WE HAVE HAD GREAT RELATIONSHIPS WITH, INCLUDING BUILDING TRAILS THAT CONNECTED GLACIER HILLS AND GREEN HILLS TO THE NORTH. OUR MOST RECENT PROJECTS, WE HAVE A -- WE PUT A GEOTHERMAL WELLS BEHIND THE SCHOOL WHEN WE BUILT THE NEW SCIENCE WING, WE PUT A GREEN ROOF ON IT. THE RETENTION PONDS AND ALL OF THE WORK WE HAVE DONE, HAVE BEEN IN KEEPING WITH OUR CORE PRINCIPLES AND THE MIDDLE EAST T PROJECT IS A GREAT EXAMPLE. WE WORKED WITH THE ECOLOGY CENTER DOWNTOWN TO MAKE SURE THE TURF FIELD IS GOING TO BE ORGANIC INFILL. WE HAVE BEEN RESEARCHING THE PFAS IN THE GRASS BLADES AND THE ARTIFICIAL GRASS BLADES. WE ARE VERY MUCH TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE FACT THAT ON THE ONE HAND WE ARE THE LAST TO GO TURF. WE ARE REALLY ONE OF THE ONLY SCHOOLS IN MHSAA TO ONLY HAVE A GRASS FIELD, BUT WE HAVE LEARNED. WE LEARNED FROM THE LOCAL SCHOOLS AND SOME OF THE DECISIONS THEY MADE ABOUT THEIR TURF PROJECTS. THIS IS A FIELD THAT IS NECESSARY FOR OUR STUDENT ATHLETES BECAUSE IT'S A MICHIGAN SPRING AND FALL AND WHEN YOU HAVE ONE FIELD, WE END UP HAVING TO ACTUALLY USE A LOT OF OUR LOCAL SCHOOLS' FIELDS WHEN OURS IS UNPLAYABLE. AND THE TRACK IS AN AGING TRACK AND WE HAVE TO REPLACE IT WITH AN EIGHT LANE TRACK THAT WILL MEET THE NEEDS OF THE STUDENT ATHLETES. WE ARE EXCITED ABOUT THIS PROJECT AS WE ARE WITH EVERYTHING AT GREENHILLS. IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED AND WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO GETTING IT IN THE GROUND AND GETTING IT GOING. I'M GOING TO TURN IT OVER NO YOU TO EMILY, WHO WILL TALK A LITTLE BUILT MORE AND THEN I LOOK FORWARD TO ANSWERING SOME QUESTIONS.
00:29:08.551: >> YES, AND WE SUBMITTED SOME SLIDE SHOWS. DO I NEED TO SHARE THAT, JOE? YEAH? OKAY. HERE, I WILL SHARE THAT FOR YOU.
00:29:17.927: >> GREAT. THANK YOU. GREAT. YOU CAN MOVE TO THE NEXT ONE, JILL. HOLD ON JUST A MINUTE. IT JUST FULLED UP MY WHOLE SCREEN AND I LOST MY NOTES. THERE WE GO. ALL RIGHT. THANKS. SO THIS PROJECT AS PETER INTRODUCED YOU TO IS REPRAISING AND IMPROVING THE ATHLETIC FIELD, WHICH IS LOCATED BETWEEN THE SCHOOL FACILITY AND THE HIGHWAY, SO EAST OF THE FACILITIES. AND AS HE NOTED, NEED TO DO THIS IS REALLY FOR THE STUDENT ATHLETES' SAFETY AND TO IMPROVE THE ATHLETIC CONDITIONS THAT THE STUDENT ATHLETES ARE USING HERE, AND TO MAKE THE AREA MORE USABLE DURING ADVERSE WEATHER CONDITIONS WITH THIS SYNTHETIC SURF BEING IN THE MIDDLE THERE. IN ADDITION TO THAT, IT ACTUAL -- ACTUALLY, THE IMPROVEMENTS WILL ALLOW FOR STORMWATER MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENTS, WITH REPLACING THE TRACK, FROM SIX LANES AND GOING TO EIGHT LANES THERE AND IMPROVING SOME OF THE INFIELD AREAS WITH TRACK SURFACE, AND THEN THE INTERIOR GOING FROM NATURAL TURF TO SYNTHETIC TURF, WE ARE INCREASING THE IMPERVIOUS SURFACE OF THE SITE EVER SO SLIGHTLY WHICH TRIGGERS SOME OF THE STORMWATER MANAGEMENT REQUIREQUIREMENTS OUT. HERE WE ARE LIMITED BY THE CLAY SOILS OUT HERE. WE HAVE AN UNDERGROUND DETENTION THAT WILL BE OCCURRING UNDERNEATH THE NEW SYNTHETIC TURF FIELD THAT WILL BE MANAGED TO MANAGE THE 100 YEAR, 24-HOUR STORM EVENT WITH A RELEASE RATE THAT'S BEEN APPROVED BY THE WASHTENAW WATER RESOURCE COMMISSION. THE DRAINAGE IN THIS AREA WILL DISCHARGE TO THE NORTH THROUGH THE EXISTING DRAINAGE SYSTEM AND CONNECT TO THE EXISTING DRAINAGE SYSTEM, THERE THROUGH THE RESTRICTED OUTLET. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH -- AS YOU HAVE SEEN ON THE PLANS, WITH JS VIG, SMITH GROUP AND JS VIG HAVE WORKED ON A NUMBER OF PROJECTS IN THE AREA, WE HAVE A LOT OF SUCCESS WITH THAT AND GREENFIELD. IT'S A REMINDER OF HOW WE CAN GET ACCESS TO THIS AREA AS IT'S BEHIND THE FIELDS -- BEHIND THE SCHOOL AND WE ARE AWARE THAT CONSTRUCTION ACCESS IS AND LIMITING DISTURBANCE OF OTHER AREAS. THAT AREA WHERE ATHLETIC FIELD IS, IS THE ONLY AREA OF DISTURBANCE. WE ARE NOT PROPOSING ANY IMPROVEMENTS AT THE DRIVEWAYS OR PARKING LOT AREAS, AND AS INDICATED IN THE STAFF REPORT, THIS IS A REQUEST FOR A LANDSCAPE MODIFICATION, SINCE WE ARE NOT CHANGING ANYTHING IN THE PARKING LOT, WE DON'T MEET THE REQUIREMENTS THE INTERIOR LANDSCAPING, IN TERMS OF SIZES BUT WE MEET THE INTENT OF THE OR ORDINANCE HERE AND ALL THE OTHER LANDSCAPE REQUIREMENTS AROUND THE SITE OR IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE ORDINANCE THROUGH THERE. IF YOU CLICK THROUGH, I PROBABLY TALKED THROUGH MOST EVER THESE OTHER SLIDES BUT WE CAN SHARE A LITTLE BIT MORE INFORMATION. THE NEXT ONE SHOWS THE -- THE ZOOMED IN. THAT'S THE PROPOSED FIELD RIGHT THERE, AS I SAID. SO EXISTING FIELD RIGHT HERE, YOU CAN SEE ALL THE NATURAL TURF ON THE INSIDE. JUST SIX LANES OF TRACK. MOVING TO THE NEXT SLIDE, YOU CAN SEE THE GRAPHIC REPRESENTATION OF A SLIGHTLY WIDER TRACK, TO INCLUDE EIGHT LANES, AS WELL AS NEW INTERIOR TRACK SURFACE, AT EACH END OF THE TRACK. AND THEN A SYNTHETIC TURF WILL BE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FIELD THIS. IF YOU CAN CLICK THROUGH TO A FEW OF THE OTHER ONES, YOU CAN SEE SOME OF THE STORMWATER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM OUTLINED, WHICH IS IN STONE BASE UNDERNEATH THE FIELD, WHICH HELPS TO STABILIZE THE FIELD AND PROVIDE A MORE STABLE FIELD DURING OTHER CONDITIONS AS WELL. THAT'S THE PROPOSED LAYOUT THERE. SO THE INTENT IS HAD TO MOVE FORWARD. HOPEFULLY WE CAN RECEIVE APPROVAL FOR THIS AND CONSTRUCTION CAN START THIS SUMMER WITH THE TRACK BEING COMPLETED IN ORDER FOR THE SPRING SPORTS PERIOD OF 2021. WHEN HOPEFULLY WE ARE ALL BACK TO PARTICIPATING AND WATCHING SPORTS. I THINK THAT'S ALL WE HAD. PETER OR JOHN, AND JOE, FROM JS VIG ARE HERE. JEFF, IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT WE MISSED THAT YOU WANT TO POINT OUT.
00:34:34.977: >> NO, EMILY, I THOUGHT YOU DID A FINE JOB SUMMARIZING THE PROJECT. DELIGHTED THAT YOU BROUGHT YOUR WHOLE CREW WITH YOU TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. I WOULD ONLY ADD THAT STAFF RECOMMENDS THAT THE SITE PLAN BE APPROVED BECAUSE IT WOULD COMPLY WITH ALL LOCAL, STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. THEY WOULD DISTURB THE LAND MINIMALLY. AND IT WOULD NOT CAUSE A PUBLIC OR PRIVATE NUISANCE. IT WOULD NOT HAVE A DETRIMENTAL EFFECT ON PUBLIC HEALTH, SAFETY AND WELFARE. SECONDLY THE STAFF RECOMMENDS THAT THE LANDSCAPE MODIFICATION BE APPROVED BECAUSE THE MODIFICATIONS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE INTENT OF THE ORDINANCE, AND ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE PREVIOUSLY APPROVED SITE PLAN. THAT'S ALL I HAVE.
00:35:26.895: >> Chair Milshteyn: GREAT THANK YOU SO MUCH, MR. KAHAN. AT THIS TIME, I WOULD LIKE TO OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING ON THIS ITEM. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PERSONS TO SPEAK UP TO THREE MINUTES ABOUT THIS APPLICATION TO COMMENT, PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS FOR THE RECORD. THE PUBLIC COMMENT WILL BE MADE BY PHONE AT THE NUMBER APPEARING ON THE PUBLISHED AGENDA AND DISPLAYED ON MEETING'S VIDEO FEED. IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN SPEAKING, PLEASE CALL THE MEETING WITH THE INFORMATION PROVIDED. CITY STAFF WILL SELECT CALLERS THAT HAVE RAISED THEIR HAND ONE BY ONE, USING THE LAST THREE DIGITS OF YOUR TELEPHONE NUMBER. IN ORDER TO ELECTRONICALLY RAISE YOUR HAND TO SPEAK, PLEASE PRESS STAR NINE ON YOUR PHONE AT THIS TIME. THAT IS STAR NINE.
00:36:20.015: >> CALLER, 963, GO AHEAD.
00:36:21.617: >> MY NAME IS RITA ROSS, I LIVE AT 782 GREENHILLS DRIVE. AND I LIVE IN EARHART VILLAGE HOMES. I BELIEVE THE SITE PLAN SAYS THAT THIS IS THE PROPERTY WEST AND AN APARTMENT COMPLEX, BUT IT IS NOT AN APARTMENT COMPLEX. IT'S A CONDOMINIUM ASSOCIATION OF 174 TOWNHOUSES. MY CONCERNS ARE ABOUT THE BUFFERING LANDSCAPE, THE TRAFFIC IMPACTS AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF THE PROJECT. IN TERMS OF THE BUFFERING OF -- THE BUFFER LANDSCAPE, WHEN GREENHILLS INSTALLED THEIR TENNIS COURTS AND THE TRACK ORIGINALLY, THERE WAS A SITE PLAN THAT HAD A BUFFERED LANDSCAPING. THAT WAS NEVER DONE. IT WAS PART OF THE MAN. IT AS APPROVED, AND TALKED ABOUT IT, BUT APPARENTLY THEY RAN OUT OF FUNDS AND THEY NEVER PUT IN THE BUFFERED LANDSCAPING. SO IF YOU ARE REFERRING TO THAT, IT WAS NEVER DONE. AND CURRENTLY, THE SITUATION NOW IS THAT THE C CANOPY TREES THAT SEPARATE THE CONDOMINIUM ASSOCIATION FROM THE SCHOOL'S PARKING LOT, SEVERAL OF THOSE LARGE PINE TREES HAVE BEEN REMOVED AND NOT REPLACED. MANY ARE DISTRESSED DUE TO DROUGHT CONDITIONS. AND MUCH OF THE MATURE VEGETATION HAS DIED OFF, THEREFORE, EXPOSING THE PARKING LOT AND THE CONDOMINIUM HOMEOWNERS TO VEHICLE NOISE AND TO LIGHT POLLUTION. SO I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE SCHOOL IMPROVE THREE DETERIORATING BUFFERING CONDITIONS AND BRING IT UP TO WHAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE FROM THE PREVIOUS SITE PLAN THAT WAS NEVER COMPLETED. I CURRENTLY ALSO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT ROAD SAFETY AND ACCESS. PRIMARILY DURING DROPOFF AND PICKUP HOURS THEY SCHOOLS, IT'S VERY CONGESTED, AS YOU WOULD EXPECT. BUT MY CONCERN IS -- IS WHAT WILL THE CONSTRUCTION TRAFFIC BE LIKE WHEN THIS OCCURS? MOST IMPORTANTLY, WE HAVE PEDESTRIANS, STUDENTS WALKING TO THE CORNER OF EARHART AND GREENHILLS. I DID NOT KNOW UNTIL THIS MEETING TODAY THAT THIS CONSTRUCTION WAS OCCURRING IN THE SUMMER, WHICH WOULD BE GREAT. IT WOULD ELIMINATE A LOT OF THAT PROBLEM, BUT IT IS A CONCERN AND I WOULD HOPE THAT HOMEOWNERS COULD BE ASSURED THAT CONSTRUCTION VEHICLES AND TRAFFIC ON GREENHILLS WOULD NOT BE FURTHER INCUMBERED. LASTLY, I'M CONCERNED ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION. EARHART CONDOMINIUMS --
00:39:05.113: >> 30 SECONDS, CALLER.
00:39:06.982: >> HAS HAD AN EXCELLENT RELATIONSHIP WITH GREENHILLS, AND WHEN THEIR BUSES WERE IDLING IN THE PARKING LOT AND CAUSING FUMES TO COME INTO OUR HOMES THEY MADE ARRANGEMENT TO MOVE THEIR BUSES TO AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT AREA OF THE SCHOOL PROPERTY AND WE HAVE BEEN VERY GRATEFUL FOR THAT. WE WOULD JUST LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE ASSURANCES THAT CONSTRUCTION VEHICLES DO NOT PARK IN THAT PARTICULAR PARKING LOT, CREATING FUMES AND ODOR AND NOISE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
00:39:39.347: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU SO MUCH. IF THERE IS ANYBODY ELSE THAT WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION WITH REGARDS TO THIS ITEM, PLEASE PRESS STAR NINE.
00:39:52.894: >> I DON'T SEE ANY OTHERS.
00:39:54.863: >> Chair Milshteyn: OKAY. SEEING NO ONE ELSE, I WILL READ THE MOTION. THERE ARE TWO MOTIONS THAT WE HAVE THIS EVENING. DOES ANYONE OPPOSE TAKING THEM TOGETHER? SEEING NO UP WITH, I WILL GO AHEAD AND READ BOTH OF THE MOTIONS. THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION HEREBY APPROVES THE GREENHILLS SCHOOL, 850 GREENHILLS DRIVE SITE PLAN FOR PLANNING COMMISSION APPROVAL, AND THE SECOND MOTION IS THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION HEREBY APPROVES THE PROPOSED LANDSCAPE MODIFICATIONS ACCORDING TO THE UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE SECTION 5.30.2 LANDSCAPE MODIFICATIONS. WILL A COMMISSIONER MOVE THIS? MOVED BY COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN, SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL. WE ARE IN DISCUSSION, AND MY PLAN IS JUST TO -- I WILL KEEP TABS OF WHO HAS RAISED THEIR HAND AND AS A CALL A NEW SPEAKER, WHOEVER IS IN THE QUEUE, I WILL LET THEM KNOW THAT THEY ARE IN THE QUEUE. SO ANY DISCUSSION? COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL?
00:41:02.497: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: WE ALSO, AS I'M SURE YOU ALL KNOW, HAD A WRITTEN CORRESPONDENCE THAT COVERED MANY OF THE POINTS THAT THE CALLER JUST IDENTIFIED. AND I HAVEN'T DRIVEN OUT TO THE SITE, BUT I JUST WANTED TO GET A SENSE FROM MR. KAHAN. I'M ASSUMING THAT BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF THE PROJECT THAT'S GOING ON THAT, THE WHOLE SITE HAS TO COME UP TO COMPLIANCE AND THAT'S WHY WE ARE LOOKING AT THE PARKING LOT SCREENING AND THINGS LIKE THAT WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THIS PROJECT. BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY IF THE LANDSCAPE ISLANDS ARE TWO SMALL AND THEY ARE FAR DISTANT, THAT'S WHY THIS IS ALL BECOMING REVIEWED AT THIS POINT?
00:41:48.677: >> RIGHT. JUST GLOBALLY, WE REQUIRE EVERY SITE PLAN TO ENSURE ALL THE TREES THAT WERE ORIGINALLY SHOWN ON THE SITE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO BE PROVIDED, AND IF THEY DIE, OR IF THEY ARE REMOVED, WE REQUIRE THAT THEY BE RESTORED AND AS YOU CAN IMAGINE IF A SITE HAS BEEN THERE OVER 50 YEARS, THERE WILL BE SOME DIE BACK. MY GUESS IS THAT THE FOLKS WHO TYPICALLY LOOK AT LANDSCAPING, PROBABLY DIDN'T GO BACK TO THE OLD SITE PLANS TO SEE WHAT WAS THERE. WE CAN CERTAINLY DO THAT. WE DO THAT PERIODICALLY IF WE RECEIVE CONCERNS OR COMPLAINTS FROM NEARBY RESIDENTS THAT MAYBE TREES ARE GONE FROM A PARTICULAR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT. WE WILL WORK WITH THE PROPERTY OWNERS TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAD REPLACE THE TREES ORIGINALLY SHOWN ON THE SITE PLAN AND WE CAN CERTAINLY DO THAT IN THIS CASE.
00:42:47.636: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: I THINK THAT WOULD BE GOOD BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S AT LEAST AN ACCUSATION OF LANDSCAPING NOT PUT IN IN THE FIRST PLACE TOO, SO SOME SORT OF CONSHCORROBORATION, AND THE PAST PROMISES WHETHER THEY WERE MADE AND BROKEN AND THROUGH ATTRITION, AND BEING ABLE TO DO THAT. WHEN I JUST -- AGAIN, I HAVEN'T DRIVEN OUT THERE. I'M JUST DOING THE GOOGLE STREET VIEW VERSION. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE LOT OVER ON THE SOUTH, IT LOOKS PRETTY WELL VEGETATED IN TERMS THE INTENT OF YOUR ORDINANCE. I DON'T SEE A CONTINUOUS, YOU KNOW, BERM OR HEDGE THAT'S 4 FEET TALL TO MEET YOUR CONFLICTING LAND USE BUFFER ORDINANCE OVER ON THAT SIDE, BUT, AGAIN, I THINK THE INTENT IS MET. I THINK THE PARKING LOT TO THE NORTH, HOWEVER, LOOKS MORE SPARSE TO ME, IN TERMS OF THE COVERAGE. AND SO PERHAPS YOU MIGHT TAKE -- LOOK AT THAT A LITTLE BIT IN TERMS OF WHAT NEIGHBORS WOULD SEE, BECAUSE THERE'S SOME GAPS THAT ARE IN THERE AND IT'S PROBABLY JUST THROUGH ATTRITION OF TREES AND THINGS LIKE THAT. IF IT'S COMING UP TO SNUFF AND WE ARE LOOKING AT THE WHOLE SITE PLAN, I'M PERSONALLY COMFORTABLE WITH UNDERSIZED LANDSCAPING ISLANDS IN THE MIDDLE OF A PARKING LOT BECAUSE IT'S A PRETTY BIG LIFT TO RECONFIGURE THEM. I DO THINK THAT PROMISES ARE MADE ABOUT HOW WE ARE GOING TO HANDLE SCREENING AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND I THINK THESE OPPORTUNITIES FOR -- FOR RENOVATION, ALLOW US TO LOOK AT SITE PLANS AGAIN AND TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE MEETING OUR STANDARDS AND ARE COMPLYING WITH OUR STANDARDS, AS WELL AS WORKING WITH NEIGHBORS TO TRY TO WORK THINGS OUT IN THAT WAY. SO THAT'S MY TWO CENTS.
00:44:43.084: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER MILLS?
00:44:46.888: >> Vice Chair Mills: THANKS. AND THIS IS JUST AN IMMEDIATE FOLLOW-UP, BECAUSE THAT WAS MY COMMENT AS WELL. WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO ENSURE THAT THAT FOLLOW-UP, THE CHECKING KIND OF ON THE LANDSCAPING, IN PARTICULAR, TO PAST SITE PLANS, HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT THAT HAPPENS? DO WE NEED TO HAVE, LIKE, A -- SOMETHING THAT'S ADDED TO THE MOTION OR IS IT JUST TALKING ABOUT IT HERE ENOUGH? I GUESS THAT'S -- [ NO AUDIO ] THE QUESTION FOR STAFF.
00:45:20.588: >> Planning Manager:  I DON'T THINK WE NEED ANYTHING SPECIFIC TO THE MOTION. WHAT WE CAN DO IS JUST REVIEW PAST PROJECT FILES FOR THOSE PAST SITE PLANS AND AS PART OF -- AS PART OF SORT OF SITE COMPLIANCE FOR ANY CHANGES, IF THIS PROPOSED PLAN IS APPROVED, WE CAN JUST INCORPORATE COMPLIANCE WITH THOSE PAST PLANS TO ENSURE THAT EVERYTHING IS APPROPRIATE. AS -- AS JEFF INDICATED, AS WE HEAR -- YOU KNOW, WE ARE NOT PROACTIVELY GOING OUT TO EVERY SITE PLAN THAT'S APPROVED AFTER IT'S BEEN SORT OF REALIZED AND MONITORING THE HEALTH OF THOSE LANDSCAPING, THAT IS A REQUIREMENT THAT IT IS MAINTAINED, SO, IN SHORT WE DON'T NEED ANYTHING SPECIFIC IN THE MOTION AND WE CAN INCORPORATE THAT COMPLIANCE AS WE GO FORWARD.
00:46:08.870: >> GREAT. THANK.
00:46:12.507: >> Vice Chair Mills: AND THEN I WANTED TO VERIFY, TO BE CLEAR, THE CHANGE YOU JUST CHECK TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE LANDSCAPING AND THE BUFFERING AND THAT KIND OF THING ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH WHAT WE HAVE, AND SO THIS IS WHERE PRESUMABLY LIKE THIS IDEA FOR THE LANDSCAPING ISLANDS HAS BEEN ADDED SINCE THAT -- THAT PARKING LOT WAS BUILT, LIKE OUR ORDINANCE CHANGE IS A LIVING DOCUMENT, AND SO THAT'S -- THAT'S ONE OF THE PLACES WHERE WE HAVE MADE THAT CHANGE, GENERALLY IF THEY WERE TO BUILD A NEW PARKING LOT, WE WOULD REQUIRE THOSE LANDSCAPING ISLANDS, BUT THAT IS A HEAVY LIFT IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE. IS THAT -- IS THAT CORRECT, KIND OF WHAT -- HOW I CHARACTERIZED THAT?
00:46:54.182: >> I THINK IT WAS. I THINK YOU SUMMARIZED IT WELL. I THINK THAT IT'S A GREAT ADDITION TO OUR CODE SECTION, BUT IT'S EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE AND FOR SOMEONE WHO IS MAYBE TWEAKING A LITTLE PART OF THEIR SITE, IT COULD DISCOURAGE A LOT OF -- A LOT OF IMPROVEMENTS.
00:47:14.269: >> Vice Chair Mills: SORRY FOR THE KIDS SCREAMING IN THE BACKGROUND. IT'S BATH NIGHT. THE OTHER QUESTION THAT I HAD WAS -- SO IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE, LIKE OF ALL THE CHANGES THAT HAVE HAPPENED OVER TIME, IS THAT THE ONLY THING THAT REALLY THEN REQUIRED THAT [ NO AUDIO ] WILL BE APPROVING?
00:47:37.058: >> SARAH, WOULD YOU MIND RESTATING THAT? THE LAST PART OF YOUR STATEMENT WAS CUT OFF FOR ME.
00:47:43.531: >> Vice Chair Mills: SORRY. THE QUESTION WAS:  IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE -- IN DOING THAT REVIEW, WAS THE -- THE PARKING LOT ISLANDS THE ONLY THING THAT WAS OUT OF COMPLIANCE OR IS KIND OF LANDSCAPE -- [ NO AUDIO ] THAT WE'RE APPROVING TONIGHT SOMETHING ELSE THAT WE HAVE TO -- WAS THERE ANYTHING ELSE CAPTURED IN THAT?
00:48:08.156: >> MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IT'S ONLY THE -- THE MODIFICATION IS -- WAS THE FOCUS FOR TONIGHT. BRETT, YOU MAY HAVE HAD A BETTER CHANCE OF HEARING SARAH'S WHOLE STATEMENT. SO YOU MAY WANT TO INTERJECT.
00:48:24.672: >> Planning Manager:  TO MY UNDERSTANDING, IF I'M UNDERSTANDING YOUR QUESTION CORRECTLY, THAT'S THE ONLY MODIFICATION THAT IS NECESSARY FOR COMPLIANCE.
00:48:36.384: >> MAY I ADD SOMETHING, THIS IS EMILY FROM SMITH GROUP. I WANT TO SAY AS YOU SEE IN THE PLANS THAT WE HAVE A COPY OF, WE DID AN EXTENSIVE TREE SURVEY OF THE ENTIRE PROPERTY AND CONFIRMED TREE SPECIES AND SIZE AND CONDITION OUT THERE. AND, JEFF, YOU CAN CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG HERE BUT I DO BELIEVE WE ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH EXISTING REQUIREMENTS, IN TERMS OF CONFLICTING LAND USE BUFFERS AND OTHER ELEMENTS REQUIRED BY THE LANDSCAPE ORDINANCE. AND I BELIEVE THE ONLY THING THAT WE DON'T MEET IN THE CURRENT ORDINANCE REGARDLESS OF WHAT MAY HAVE BEEN ON PREVIOUS SITE PLANS IS THE LANDSCAPE ISLANDS AS THEY HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED.
00:49:17.759: >> THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING. TIFFANY JAKABOZI DOES THE LANDSCAPING REVIEW. SHE DOES A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW AND SHE WOULD HAVE DONE THIS FOR THE WHOLE SITE. THE ONE THING THAT IS NOT CURRENTLY CONSISTENT WITH CODE IS THE LANDSCAPE MODIFICATIONS WITHIN THE ISLANDS. BUT STARTING TOMORROW MORNING, I'M GOING TO CONTACT TIFFANY, AND EMILY, WE'LL CERTAINLY WORK WITH YOU ON HAVING A LOOK AT THOSE OLDER PLANS TO MAKE SURE THAT WHATEVER TREES WERE IDENTIFIED ON THOSE PLANS ARE -- ARE REPLACED IF THEY -- IF THEY HAVE BEEN LOST.
00:50:03.271: >> Chair Milshteyn: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COMMISSIONER WOODS?
00:50:11.412: >> Commissioner Woods: SORRY. I HAD TO UNMUTE MYSELF. JUST A QUESTION THAT THE NEIGHBOR BROUGHT UP CONCERNING THE CONSTRUCTION AND WHEN THAT MIGHT TAKE PLACE, AND HER CONCERN ABOUT THE NOISE OR THE TRAFFIC, AND I WAS WONDERING IF SOMEONE MIGHT BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THAT. I KNOW -- I THINK MR. FAYROIAN, YOU INDICATED THAT CONSTRUCTION MAY START THAT SUMMER. IS THAT PENDING THE GOVERNOR'S PERMISSION OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT? AND THEN COULD YOU GIVE US A SENSE OF THE HOURS THAT THE WORK WOULD TAKE PLACE AND WHETHER OR NOT YOU WOULD ANTICIPATE -- I'M ASSUMING YOU WOULD PREFER THAT IT NO NOT TAKE PLACE WHILE SCHOOL WAS IN SESSION, BUT COULD YOU JUST GIVE US A LITTLE SENSE OF THAT SO WE CAN MAKE SURE WE ARE ADDRESSING THE CONCERNS THAT THAT ANYBODY BROUGHT UP?
00:51:03.264: >> SURE. MY PREFERENCE IS THAT SCHOOL IS IN SESSION, FIRST OF ALL. (LAUGHTER).
00:51:08.703: >> Commissioner Woods: OURS TOO.
00:51:10.171: >> WHICH ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW THIS IS THE THING WITH US, RIGHT? IS NO BETTER TIME FOR US TO HAVE A CONSTRUCTION PROJECT AT A SCHOOL RIGHT NOW AND THERE'S NO SCHOOL AND NO TRAFFIC AND, YOU KNOW, IT WOULD BE IDEAL. SO I WILL TURN IT OVER TO JOE VIG, WHO CAN TALK ABOUT THE DETAILS ABOUT THE TRUCKS COMING IN AND OUT AND WHEN HE AND WE WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN THIS PROJECT.
00:51:32.493: >> GOOD EVENING. I'M JOE VIG, WITH JS VIG CONSTRUCTION COMPANY, AND, YOU KNOW, HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF KNOWING THE SCHOOL VERY WELL. MY CHILDREN WENT TO SCHOOL AT GRGREENHILLS AND I HAVE BEEN A CONSTRUCTION MANAGER FOR GREENHILLS FOR PROBABLY SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS NOW, ON MULTIPLE PROJECTS. AND, YOU KNOW, WE ARE VERY MINDFUL AND AWARE OF THE RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT TO THE WEST. AND WE HAVE WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH JOHN NICHOL AND HIS TEAM TO TRY TO ADDRESS ANY OF THEIR CONCERNS IN THE PAST. YOU KNOW, AS EMILY MENTIONED, IN HER PRESENTATION, WHEN THIS PROJECT WAS DESIGNED, WE ACTUALLY DESIGNED THE CONSTRUCTION ACCESS ROAD, THE SMITH GROUP DID, AROUND THE EAST SIDE OF THE BUILDING. SO CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY WILL ENTER THE SIDE AT THE NORTH END OF THE SITE, AND IT WILL BE ROUTED AROUND THE EAST SIDE OF THE BUILDING. THE CLOSEST PROXIMITY OF THE FIELD CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY TO THE RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS IS ABOUT 500 FEET, AND, YOU KNOW, AS MY FIELD SUPERVISOR POINTED OUT TO ME, THERE'S QUITE A BIT OF ELEVATION CHANGE AS WELL AS YOU EXTEND FROM WEST TO EAST, YOU KNOW, WESTERN ELEVATIONS SIT HIGHER IN ELEVATION. AND THEN ALSO AS YOU SAW IN EMILY'S PRESENTATION, THE STORMWATER CONNECTION IS TO SOUTH OF THE PROPERTY. SO THERE'S REALLY KIND OF NO INTERFERENCE OR DIRECT CONFLICT BETWEEN ANY OF THE RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT TO THE WEST, AND THIS CONSTRUCTION PROJECT. THAT WOULD BE MAYBE IN CONTRAST TO THE LAST PROJECT THAT WE DID, THE MOST RECENT PROJECT THAT WE DID, WHERE WE HAD CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY HAPPENING ON THE WEST SIDE IN THEST WEST PARKING LOT, AND THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE DIRECT BUT WE STILL MANAGED TO MITIGATE THAT, YOU KNOW, QUITE WELL. FROM A PEDESTRIAN SAFETY STANDPOINT, I THINK THAT WAS A REALLY GOOD QUESTION BY THE CALLER SO, YOU KNOW, WE WILL HAVE FLAG PEOPLE STATIONED AT APPROPRIATE POINTS SO THAT WHEN WE HAVE TRUCKS ENTERING AND EXITING THE PROPERTY, YOU KNOW, WE WILL HAVE SAFETY CONTROLS IN PLACE. AND THEN ALSO, FROM A KIND OF DUST MITIGATION STANDPOINT, WE WILL HAVE IN ADDITION TO THE -- YOU KNOW, THE SOIL EROSION CONTROLS THAT ARE EXPLICITLY CALLED FOR ON THE PLANS, WE HAVE A CAN COMPLETE KIND OF DUST MITIGATION STRATEGY AND STREET SWEEPING STRATEGY. SO BECAUSE OF OUR FAMILIARITY WITH THE EXPECTATIONS OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD, WE ARE VERY CONFIDENT THAT WE CAN MEET THOSE REQUIREMENTS. IN FACT, I PERSONALLY KNOW RESIDENTS IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND I'M EXTREMELY MINDFUL OF THEIR EARN CANS. THANK YOU.
00:54:41.749: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU. ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL RIGHT. COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL.
00:54:49.256: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: WHEN YOU HAVE TIFFANY LOOK AT THINGS, I'M JUST LOOKING AT THE WASHTENAW COUNTY'S, YOU KNOW, AERIALS AND THINGS, AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE NORTH PARKING LOT, IT GETS PRETTY THIN IN TERMS OF A BUFFER AND I KNOW -- YOU KNOW, FOR ANY NEW DEVELOPMENT, THERE'S -- THERE'S QUITE A FEW COMPONENTS TO THE CONFLICTING LAND USE BUFFER AND I DON'T SEE SHRUBS AND THINGS LIKE THAT IN THERE. SO JUST HAVE HER LOOK AT ALL OF THE DIFFERENT COMPONENTS WHICH ARE EVERGREEN TREES, DECIDUOUS TREES AND A 4-FOOT SHRUB OR -- A 4-FOOT HEDGE OR BERM. JUST MAKE SURE THAT IF WE ARE REVIEWING IT FOR THAT AND THIS IS GOING THROUGH AND GETTING PASSED BY US THAT SHE'S LOOKING AT IT WITH THOSE EYES TOO.
00:55:36.637: >> WILL DO.
00:55:39.206: >> Chair Milshteyn: ALL RIGHT. FURTHER DISCUSSION? COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT.
00:55:43.778: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: JUST REALLY QUICK SO I CAN FEEL GOOD ABOUT ASKING THIS QUESTION. JOE, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR EXPLAINING, YOU KNOW, THE PROCESS THAT YOU ARE GOING TO GO THROUGH TO MAKE SURE THAT ENVIRONMENTALLY AND FROM SAFETY PERSPECTIVE IS GOOD. I'M ASSUMING YOU WILL HAVE SIGNS UP SO THAT A RESIDENT DOES HAVE AN ISSUE, THEY WILL KNOW EXACTLY WHO TO CALL TO MAKE A COMPLAINT?
00:56:05.599: >> YOU KNOW, THAT'S AN EXCELLENT SUGGESTION AND WE ABSOLUTELY WILL DO THAT.
00:56:11.238: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: OKAY. GREAT. THANK YOU.
00:56:16.811: >> Chair Milshteyn: GREAT. FURTHER DISCUSSION? I THINK GREENHILLS WINS IN REGARDS OF DURING MY WHAT FEELS LIKE NOT MANY YEARS, BUT IT'S BEEN A COUPLE OF YEARS THAT I HAVE BEEN ON THE COMMISSION. I THINK THIS IS THE THIRD TIME THAT WE HAVE SEEN YOU FOR DIFFERENT CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS. SO YOU GUYS ARE DEFINITELY BUSY THERE. ANY OTHER DISCUSSION? ALL RIGHT. SEEING NO ONE, WE ARE READY FOR A VOTE. ALL OF THOSE -- ACTUALLY, WE WILL BE DOING A ROLL CALL VOTE. SO I WILL HAND IT OFF TO MR. LENART FOR THAT.
00:56:50.110: >> YES, SO NOW YOU CAN EITHER -- I WOULD PREFER YOU GIVE ME BOTH AN AUDIO AND A VISUAL FOR PREFERENCE. SO THE MOTION IS BOTH MOTIONS TOGETHER, AS PRESENTED, FOR BOTH THE APPROVAL OF THE SITE PLAN AND THE LANDSCAPE MODIFICATION. COMMISSIONER WOODS?
00:57:09.897: >> Commissioner Woods: YES.
00:57:10.798: >> COMMISSIONER BRIGGS?
00:57:15.269: >> Commissioner Briggs: YES.
00:57:16.670: >> Vice Chair Mills: YES.
00:57:17.404: >> Chair Milshteyn: YES.
00:57:17.938: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: YES.
00:57:20.307: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES.
00:57:25.446: >> Commissioner Sauve: YES.
00:57:26.046: >> Commissioner Abrons:  YES.
00:57:27.815: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: YES.
00:57:31.385: >> Planning Manager:  THE MOTION CARRIES UNANIMOUSLY.
00:57:35.189: >> Chair Milshteyn: GREAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
00:57:38.092: >> ZACK THANK YOU.
00:57:40.027: >> Commissioner Briggs: THANK YOU.
00:57:42.897: >> Chair Milshteyn: WE WILL MOVE ON TO 2043 NORTH MAIN STREET REZONING FOR CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL. AND WE WILL BEGIN WITH MR. KAHAN WITH THE STAFF REPORT.
00:57:56.944: >> THE SITE IS LOCATED ON THE WEST SIDE OF NORTH MAIN, NORTH OF DEPOT STREET AND IN THE HURON RIVER WATERSHED. I WILL SUMMARIZE THE STAFF REPORT AND THEN WE HAVE A FEW SLIDES WE WOE WOULD LIKE TO SHA. THE SITE IS CURRENTLY ZONED AGRICULTURE. THE MINIMUM LOT SIZE FOR THE AG DISTRICT IS 100,000 SQUARE FEET WHICH IS TWO AND A HALF ACRES WHICH MEANS A NEW SINGLE FAMILY HOME IS NON-CONFORMING FOR THE LOT SIZE WHICH IS ABOUT 6200 ACRES. 6200 SQUARE FEET. ADDITIONALLY, THE AG DISTRICT REQUIRES A MINIMUM OF A 50-FOOT REAR SETBACK THAT WOULD BASICALLY MAKE THE SITE IMPRACTICAL TO CONSTRUCT A NEW HOME ON. SO THE SITE, WE BELIEVE, IS TOO SMALL FOR ANY OTHER RESIDENTIAL ZONING DISTRICT, OTHER THAN SINGLE FAMILY. SINCE THE MINIMUM LOT SIZE FOR R1D IS 5,000 SQUARE FEET, THE PETITIONER IS PROPOSING AN R1D ZONING DISTRICT IN ORDER TO CONSTRUCT A NEW SINGLE FAMILY HOME, ACCESS WILL BE FROM NORTH MAIN STREET. STAFF RECOMMENDS THE PROPOSED R1D ZONING BE APPROVED BECAUSE IT IS AN APPROPRIATE ZONING DISTRICT FOR THE PROPOSED SINGLE FAMILY LAND USE, IT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE MASTER PLAN RECOMMENDATION AND COMPATIBLE WITH ADJOINING USES. I THINK JILL BROUGHT UP THE SLIDES FOR 1043 NORTH MAIN. THIS IS A PHOTOGRAPH LOOKING WEST OF THE -- OF THE HOUSE THAT'S THERE NOW, THAT IS NOT IN GREAT SHAPE. WE CAN GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE. THIS IS A SURVEY SHOWING PARCEL 1, WHICH INCLUDES A -- THE SINGLE FAMILY HOME. THE SINGLE FAMILY HOME DID HAVE A CARPORT THAT EXTENDED A LITTLE BIT INTO THE NORTH PROPERTY LINE, BUT THAT CARPORT HAS BEEN REMOVED. IT ALSO SHOWS A LITTLE BIT OF AN ENCROACHMENT INTO THE M DOT RIGHT-OF-WAY ALONG NORTH MAIN STREET. ONCE THE BUILDING IS REMOVED, THAT ENCROACHMENT WOULD CEASE TO EXIST. WE CAN GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE. THIS IS AN AERIAL PHOTOGRAPH SHOWING THE APPROXIMATE LOCATION OF THE HOME. AS YOU CAN SEE, IT'S PRETTY CLOSE TO -- PRETTY CLOSE TO NORTH MAIN. THERE ARE A FEW OTHER HOMES JUST IMMEDIATELY TO THE SOUTH AND BUFFERING THE SITE TO THE NORTH AND TO THE WEST IS BLUFFS PARK. WE CAN GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE. INTHIS IS A SLIDE JUST SHOWING E ZONING IN THE AREA. AS YOU CAN SEE, THE AG ZONING IS BY ITSELF THERE. ALTHOUGH I DO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE ST. THOMAS CEMETERY IS ALSO ZONED AG, JUST A BIT TO THE WEST. SO THE SOUTH IS R4C AND I BELIEVE THAT MAY BE THE LAST SLIDE, UNLESS THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE IN THERE. YEAH, THAT LOOKS LIKE IT. AND SO THAT'S THE END OF MY STAFF REPORT.
01:01:10.871: >> Chair Milshteyn: GREAT. THANK YOU. AT THIS TIME, I WOULD LIKE OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING ON THIS ITEM. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TORE PERSONS TO -- FOR PERSONS TO SPEAK UP TO THREE MINUTES. TO COMMENT, PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS FOR THE RECORD. PUBLIC COMMENT WILL BE MADE BY PHONE AT THE NUMBER APPEARED ON THE PUBLISHED AGENDA AND THE VIDEO FEED. IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK, PLEASE CALL THE MEETING WITH THE INFORMATION PROVIDED AND CITY STAFF WILL SELECT CALLERS WHO RAISED THEIR HANDS ONE BY ONE, USING THE LAST THREE DIGITS OF YOUR PHONE NUMBER. IN ORDER TO ELECTRONICALLY RAISE YOUR HAND, PLEASE PRESS STAR NINE ON YOUR PHONE. THAT IS STAR NINE IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION IN REGARDS TO THIS ITEM.
01:02:05.125: >> I SEE NO HANDS RAISED BUT I DO SEE MR. FOWLER IN THE AUDIENCE.
01:02:14.935: >> Chair Milshteyn: ALL RIGHT, SEEING NO HANDS RAISED, I WILL CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING AND I WILL READ THE MOTION. THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION HEREBY RECOMMENDS THAT THE MAYOR AND THE CITY COUNCIL APPROVE THE 1043 NORTH MAIN R1D ZONING. DO I HAVE A COMMISSIONER THAT WILL MOVE? MOVED BY COMMISSIONER MILLS, SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER ABRONS. WE ARE NOW IN DISCUSSION. COMMISSIONER BRIGGS?
01:02:41.161: >> Commissioner Briggs: YEAH, THANKS. SO I WAS WONDERING -- I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THERE WOULD BE DESIRE TO REBUILD THAT HOUSE THERE. IT'S DEFINITELY IN POOR CONDITION. AND I CAN SEE THE DESIRE TO REZONE TO A SINGLE FAMILY USE DISTRICT, BUT I WAS WONDERING IN TERMS OF HOW THIS WAS TAKEN IN CONSIDERATION WITH REGARDS TO NATURAL FEATURES AND HOW -- I WAS LOOKING AT THE DIFFERENT SORT OF PRIORITIES IN TERMS OF HIGHEST AND MIDLEVEL AND LOW LEVEL CONCERNS HOW ARE THOSE SLOPES CONSIDERED? AND I NOTICE THAT THERE'S ALREADY WORK THAT'S HAPPENING ON THE SITE. SO THAT'S ONE OF MY FIRST QUESTIONS.
01:03:25.939: >> I CAN TRY TO START MY RESPONSE BY ADDRESSING YOUR SECOND POINT, WHICH IS THE WORK THAT'S ALREADY BEEN DONE. I WAS OUT THERE YESTERDAY AND NOTICED A BOBCAT DOING SOME GRATING. I IMMEDIATELY CHECKED TO SEE IF A PERMIT HAD BEEN ISSUED AND THEN CONTACTED PETER STEVENS WHEN I DIDN'T SEE ONE. HE SAID HE WOULD INVESTIGATE THE MATTER. HE WILL THOUGHT THIS MIGHT HAVE BEEN A PERMIT ISSUED FOR ONE OF THE FOUR PARCELS ALONG THIS STRETCH. HOPEFULLY HE WILL GET BACK TO ME A LITTLE LATER THIS WEEK. WITH REGARD TO THE NATURAL FEATURES PORTION OF YOUR QUESTION, AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW, SINGLE FAMILY HOMES ARE EXEMPT FROM MEETING OUR NATURAL FEATURES REQUIREMENTS AND ON THIS -- AND ON THIS SITE, THE SLOPE OF BLUFFS DOES COME DOWN INTO THE PROPERTY. SO THERE IS SLOPE OPEN THE BACK PORTION OF THE SITE THAT'S QUITE -- THAT'S QUITE STEEP. I DON'T KNOW WHAT -- HOW STEEP IT IS. I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S 40%, BUT IT'S PRETTY STEEP AND THERE ARE SOME TREES BACK THERE. I MIGHT DEFER TO MR. FOWLER, ROB FOWLER TO SEE IF HE HAS AN IDEA ABOUT WHERE THE PROPOSED HOME WOULD BE LOCATED, TO SEE IF IT WOULD IMPACT THOSE NATURAL FEATURES.
01:04:58.365: >> YES, MY NAME IS ROB FOWLER. SO WE ARE NOT GOING TO PUSH -- OBVIOUSLY, WE ARE NOT GOING TO PUSH THE HOUSE ANY FURTHER BACK THAN WE HAVE TO BECAUSE THE FARTHER WE GO BACK, THE MORE WE HAVE TO CONTEND WITH THE HILL. WE DO FIGURE THAT WE W HAVE TO PUT IN A RETAINING WALL IN THE BACK TO GIVE US SOME SORT OF A FLAT SPOT SO WE ACTUALLY HAVE A REAR YARD.
01:05:24.291: >> Commissioner Briggs: SO THERE IS CURRENTLY -- PART OF THE HILL HAS BEEN DUG OUT, WHETHER IT'S ON THAT PROPERTY OR THE ADJACENT PROPERTY RIGHT NOW.
01:05:34.267: >> IT'S ON THE ADJACENT PROPERTY. WE HAVE A -- A PERMIT TO BUILD A GARAGE THERE ON 1041 NORTH MAIN.
01:05:50.584: >> Commissioner Briggs: SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS HOW DO THE NATURAL FEATURES THINK ABOUT A REZONING AND WHETHER THE REZONING IS APPROPRIATE GIVEN THE NATURAL FEATURES THAT ARE THERE?
01:06:05.332: >> WELL, THE --
01:06:06.166: >> Commissioner Briggs: THIS QUESTION IS MORE FOR STAFF ON THAT ONE, SORRY.
01:06:11.505: >> OH, I'M SORRY.
01:06:11.938: >> Planning Manager:  I THINK UP WITH OF THE THINGS YOU ARE REFERENCING COMMISSIONER BRIGGS IS THAT UNDER THE UDC, THERE ARE SOME EXCEPTIONS FROM REZONINGS WHERE EITHER AN AREA PLAN OR SITE PLAN IS REQUIRED. ONE OF THOSE IS WHEN A PROPOSED PROPERTY UNDER 2-ACRE IS BEING PROPOSED TO BE REZONED FOR A SINGLE FAMILY. I THINK WHAT PROBABLY THERE'S A BIT OF A GAP IN KNOWLEDGE BECAUSE THE DETAILED SITE PLAN HAS NOT BEEN ACCOMPANIED BY THIS REZONING PER THOSE STANDARDS. GIVEN THAT PROVISION, I HAVE ISSUED A WAIVER FROM THE AREA PLAN FOR THE REZONING IN THIS CIRCUMSTANCE, BECAUSE IT WAS ONLY A SINGLE FAMILY. I'M HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP ON THIS TO SEE IF THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS ABSOLUTE IN THAT DECISION OR IF THAT'S PART OF YOUR DECISION AS WELL TO SAY, NO, THAT'S SOMETHING WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE BEFORE WE MAKE THAT DETERMINATION, BUT I WILL NEED A MINUTE ON THAT. BUT IN SHORT, I DON'T THINK THAT THE NATURAL FEATURES -- MY INITIAL REACTION IS THAT THEY SHOULDN'T BE PARAMOUNT TO YOUR DECISION ON THE REZONING. THE MASTER PLAN HAS ALREADY PROVIDED SOME LEVEL OF GUIDANCE AS TO HOW THAT LAND USE SHOULD BE GOVERNED AND THEN WE IN TURN RELY ON OUR UCD, NATURAL PROTECTION ORDINANCES AND REQUIREMENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT ANY PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT THAT HAPPENS THERE IS RE RESPECTFUL F THOSE. I RECOGNIZE WE PROVIDE MORE FLEXIBILITY FOR SINGLE FAMILY USES THAN WE DO FOR SITE PLANS, BUT THAT'S THE SORT OF REGULATORY FRAMEWORK THAT WE THUS FAR HAVE CHOSEN TO ENACT AS THE CITY.
01:07:50.737: >> Commissioner Briggs: AND THEN IT'S ADJACENT TO BLUFFS PARK AND IT'S RONED R4C AND IF I'M CORRECT, NONE OF THEM APPEAR TO HAVE PARKING ASSOCIATED WITH THEM. I'M ASSUMING THAT FOLKS HAVE BEEN -- THAT THERE'S BEEN KIND OF A SHARED PARKING ARRANGEMENT THAT MAYBE HAS BEEN HAPPENING BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN AN INCREDIBLY -- THERE'S AN INCREDIBLY WIDE DRIVEWAY THERE AND A CARPORT AND THE SIDEWALK HAS ENDED AT THAT PROPERTY. AND I'M CURIOUS WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH REGARDS TO -- I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY, WE ARE JUST REZONING AND WE DON'T KNOW. BUT BASED ON HOW WE ARE SEEING THE PROPERTY USED TODAY, I WONDER IF THOSE CONSIDERATIONS HAVE BEEN LOOKED AT.
01:08:42.989: >> THAT'S WHY WE ARE BUILDING THE BIG GARAGE ON 1043 IS TO MAKE ACCOMMODATIONS FOR THE NEXT THREE PROPERTIES TO PARK.
01:08:57.704: >> Commissioner Briggs: GOT IT. SO I'M STRUGGLING A LITTLE BIT WITH THIS ONE, BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE -- I CAN UNDERSTAND THE LIMITATIONS AROUND HAVING IT ZONED AGRICULTURE, BUT IT SEEMS LIKE AN AREA THAT BASED ON KIND OF WHAT THE -- IT'S NOT A GREAT ZONING CATEGORY, BUT BASED ON WHAT THE INI INITIAL PURPOSE OFT WAS, IT SEEMED APPROPRIATE FOR THE AREA, BUT IT SEEMS INAPPROPRIATE THAT HOUSING WAS ACTUALLY EVER BUILT ON THIS PIECE OF PROPERTY. SO I'M HAVING A LITTLE PROBLEMS WITH ACTUALLY REZONING IT AND MAINTAINING SINGLE -- AND THEN PUTTING SINGLE FAMILY HOMES THERE THAT THEN DON'T HAVE TO BE RESPECTFUL TO THE NATURAL FEATURES AS MAYBE THEY SHOULD BE. THAT'S WHERE I'M AT RIGHT NOW AND TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHY WE ARE AT IT. I WILL LET OTHERS DISCUSS THIS MORE.
01:09:51.625: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN.
01:09:52.559: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR. JUST A VERY SPECIFIC QUESTION. THIS IS WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS ON THIS SIDE. WOULD ANY FUTURE CONSTRUCTION INCLUDE SIDEWALK CONTINUING THROUGH THE SITE? HOPEFULLYONE DAY CONTINUING NORTH THROUGH THE PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY AS WELL?
01:10:10.477: >> I CAN TAKE A STAB AT THAT. TYPICALLY WHEN A NEW SINGLE FAMILY IS BEING CONSTRUCTED, OUR PUBLIC SERVICES STAFF WILL ASK FOR A SIDEWALK TO BE INCLUDED. AS YOU KNOW, NORTH MAIN IS A VERY NARROW RIGHT-OF-WAY. I THINK IT MAY BE 60 OR 66 FEET, ACCOMMODATING A FOUR-LANE BOULEVARD WITH -- WITH A SIDEWALK ON THE EAST SIDE. SO THE SIDEWALK ACTUALLY IS PROBABLY GOING TO -- IF THE SIDEWALK GETS CONSTRUCTED, IT WOULD WIND UP ON PRIVATE PROPERTY, BUT WE MAY BE ABLE TO OBTAIN A PUBLIC ACCESS EASEMENT ON TOP OF IT.
01:10:49.749: >> Councilmember Ackerman: BUT THOSE ARE ALL VOLUNTARY? NONE OF THAT IS REQUIRED BY CODE?
01:10:55.955: >> I MAY ASK BRETT IF HE HAS AN IDEA ABOUT THAT.
01:10:59.626: >> Planning Manager:  ON THE SIDEWALK? I THINK IT IS -- IT IS PART OF OUR STANDARD SPECIFICATION CONSTRUCTIONS THAT A SIDEWALK BE PUT IN PLACE, HOWEVER, THERE ARE RELIEF VALVES THAT THE PUBLIC SERVICES ADMINISTRATOR, I BELIEVE, CAN DETERMINE THAT IT IS -- HE CAN WAIVE THAT REQUIREMENT AS PART OF THE ISSUANCE OF PERMIT. THIS HAVE BEEN CASES WHERE THERE AREN'T, FOR EXAMPLE, AN APPROVED STREET WHERE YOU HAVE FULL CURB AND GUTTER AND STORMWATER OR I DON'T KNOW IF THOSE EXEMPTIONS HAVE OCCURRED WHERE THERE ARE NOT AN EXISTING COMPLETE SIDEWALK NETWORK OR NOT. SO THE SHORT OF IT IS, IS THAT IT'S AN EXPECTED DETAIL, BUT THERE IS A RELIEF VALVE ADMINISTRATOR IF A COMMISSIONER WERE TO SEE TO TRY TO LIMIT THE REQUIREMENT OR AVOID THAT REQUIREMENT AS PART OF A SINGLE FAMILY HOME.
01:11:57.984: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YEAH, I REMEMBER IT WAS QUITE THE TOPIC OF CONVERSATION WE WERE DISCUSSING MEDICAL MARIJUANA PROVISIONING CENTER AT HAWKINS AUTO BODY, JUST -- THIS IS AN AREA THAT'S CHRONICALLY HAD SIDEWALK ISSUES. BUT IT WOULD BE GOOD TO PRESERVE THAT, IN CASE WE ARE EVER ABLE TO CONNECT THOSE, JUST BECAUSE IT'S ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PARTS OF TOWN, BUT ONE OF THE HARDEST TO GET TO BY FOOT OR BY BIKE, WHICH IS HOW YOU WANT TO ENJOY IT. SO MY TWO CENTS.
01:12:34.053: >> Planning Manager:  IF I COULD FOLLOW-UP O ON THAT PREVIS QUESTION. I MISSPOKE, THAT'S NOT A WAIVER GRANT. IF YOU LOOK IN SECTION 5.29.29 OF THE UDC, THE ACTUAL ORDINANCE SAYS IN THE CASE OF A REZONING FOR A SMALL ONE OR TWO FAMILY RESIDENTIAL, ONLY A DIMENSION MAP IS REQUIRED. IT DOESN'T REQUIRE AN AREA PLAN OR SITE PLAN. THEREFORE, THAT'S WHY THOSE FULL NATURAL FEATURES ANALYSIS DON'T OCCUR IN CONJUNCTION WITH THAT.
01:13:09.823: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  ON ZOOM, WE CAN'T TELL IF YOU ARE READING OR YOU JUST HAVE THE UDC MEMORIZED LIKE CHAPTER AND VERSE.
01:13:18.231: >> Planning Manager:  I WILL LEAVE IT AS A MYSTERY. ZA>> Councilmember Ackerman: COOL.
01:13:25.004: >> Chair Milshteyn: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL?
01:13:28.041: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: A COUPLE OF THINGS. ONE IN REGARDS TO THE LAST POINT ABOUT THE SIDEWALK, FURTHER UP TO NORTH, THERE WAS A NEWER HOME THAT WAS PUT IN, I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE TEN YEARS AGO, WHEN I WAS JUST LOOKING FROM STREET VIEW, THEY PUT IN A LITTLE SIDEWALK IN FRONT OF IT, JUST FOR THEIR LITTLE SECTION, JUST AS A POINT OF REFERENCE FOR SOMETHING ALONG THIS THAT HAS A VERY SIMILAR CONDITION. THE OTHER THING, I WOULD JUST LIKE TO GET MORE CLEAR ON. SO YOU ARE BUILDING A PARKING AREA BASICALLY FOR THE NEIGHBORS? IS THAT TRUE? LIKE, THAT YOU ARE PUTTING IN A GARAGE FOR ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT LIVE SOUTH OF THE PROJECT AS WELL?
01:14:11.417: >> THE OWNER OF THIS PROPERTY OWNS THREE PROPERTIES. THE THREE PROPERTIES -- [ TELEPHONE RINGING ] THOSE OTHER THREE PROPERTIES, THEY ARE ALL OWNED BY THE SAME PERSON.
01:14:26.466: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: OKAY. SO, BO BRETT, IS THERE ANY -- L, IS THAT -- THAT'S A LITTLE ODD. DOES THAT MEAN THAT THEY HAVE TO CONNECT WITH THE SIDEWALK WITH ALL OF THOSE TWO. THAT'S NOT USUAL. CAN YOU SHED A LITTLE LIGHT ON HOW THAT MIGHT FUNCTION?
01:14:43.950: >> Planning Manager:  YEAH, I DON'T KNOW THE -- I DON'T KNOW -- I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE DETAILS OF THAT PARTICULAR PERMIT. THAT WAS SOMETHING I WOULD HAVE TO FOLLOW UP, UNLESS JEFF HAS MORE DETAIL ON IT. GENERALLY, REGARDLESS OF THE ZONING DISTRICT, IF -- IF YOU ARE BUILDING -- IF IT'S ONE AND TWO FAMILY -- YEAH. LET ME JUST STOP THERE. IN SHORT, YES, IF YOU WERE -- IF YOU WERE TO BE BUILDING SOME SORT OF LARGE GARAGE OR PARKING LOT THAT WAS INTENDED TO SERVE MULTIPLE FAMILIES, THAT WAS SORT OF BEYOND THE USE OF THAT INDIVIDUAL LOT, WE WOULD NEED TO LOOK AT THAT FROM A SITE PLANNING PERSPECTIVE. THAT SAID, IF IT'S BUILDING A GARAGE TO HOUSE VEHICLES FOR A SENGLSINGLE FAMILY HOME ON THAT PROPERTY, THAT MAY NOT REQUIRE THE SAME -- THAT MAY NOT REQUIRE A SITE PLAN. IN SHORT, I WOULD HAVE TO FIND OUT MORE DETAIL ABOUT THAT PERMIT, AND LEARN MORE ABOUT THAT.
01:15:40.907: >> Comm
01:15:41.774: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: OKAY.
01:15:43.309: >> Planning Manager:  BUT TO BE CLEAR, I THINK THAT PERMIT IS FOR A DIFFERENT SITE THAN THIS ONE.
01:15:49.215: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: OKAY. I GUESS A LITTLE BIT OF DUE DILIGENCE ON THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. COMMISSIONER BRIGGS, FOR WHAT IT IS WORTH, I WILL OFTEN GO TO THE COUNTY OLD AERIAL INFORMATION TO GET A SENSE OF, LIKE ATTACHED FOREST FROM A LONG TIME AGO BECAUSE THAT GIVES ME SOME PRETTY GOOD CLUES ABOUT WHAT THE EXISTING CONDITIONS ARE LIKE AND WHEN I GO BACK IN TIME, IN 1947, THESE TWO LOTS WERE PRETTY MUCH RAISED. NO TREES. MAYBE ONE EVERGREEN, WHEREAS JUST WEST OF IT, UP THE HILL AND TO THE NORTH, IT HAS A BUNCH OF OLD OAKS. I CAN JUST TELL BY WHAT THEY ARE. SO THAT TELLS ME THERE'S PROBABLY A LOT MORE YOUNG VEGETATION THAT'S IN THAT AREA, IN TERMS OF THE HILLSIDE. IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THERE AREN'T YOUNG OAKS THERE AND THINGS LIKE THAT, BUT IT'S PROBABLY NOT THE SAME QUALITY AS WHAT'S FURTHER UP, BECAUSE CLEARLY IN THIS OLDER AERIAL, YOU CAN JUST SEE THAT THE THING WAS SCRAPED. AND NOT -- NOT MUCH WAS THERE. SO AGAIN, I KNOW WE ARE NOT REGULATING AROUND THAT, BUT JUST IN TERMS OF MY UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THAT SITE -- WITHOUT GOING OUT AND SEEING IT RIGHT NOW, YOU KNOW, HOW IT -- WHAT THE QUALITY OF IT MAY BE. MY GUESS IS THAT IT'S NOT SOME OF THE HIGHER QUALITY IN THAT AREA BASED ON THE FACT THAT IT WAS STRIPPED IN THAT TIME BECAUSE OFTEN POST THAT TIME, A LOT OF INVASIVES COME IN. THAT'S A TYPICAL SCENARIO THAT HAPPENS. NOT OFTEN, BUT A TYPICAL ONE.
01:17:23.643: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER MILLS.
01:17:29.082: >> Vice Chair Mills: SORRY. HANDLING THE MUTE IS HARD. THIS IS A FOLLOW-UP TO THE QUESTION THAT COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN ASKED ABOUT THE SIDEWALK. AND KIND OF PULLING TOGETHER WHAT COMMISSIONER BRIGGS WAS SAYING AS WELL. I SIMILARLY HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT, LIKE, WHETHER THE CONTINUATION OF SOME OF THESE USES ON THAT STRETCH OF ROAD IS WISE. THEY ARE NARROW, LIKE GETTING OUT OF THAT DRIVEWAY HAS GOT TO BE DANGEROUS, EFFECTIVELY. AT THE SAME TIME, IF IT IS CONTINUED, I WOULD JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE TAKING A STEP TOWARDS WHAT WE HOPE THAT ROAD COULD BE WHICH IS ACCESSIBLE. TO ALL SORTS OF TRAVELERS, AND SO IS THERE ANY WAY THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT -- THAT A SIDEWALK IT GET BUILT THERE, THAT IF THIS SITE IS REDEVELOPED, THAT A SIDEWALK DOES GET BUILT THERE?
01:18:35.648: >> I CAN RESPOND BY SAYING THAT MANNING CERTAINLY WOULD LIKE A NEW SIDEWALK HERE AND THAT I'M GOING TO CONTACT OUR PUBLIC SERVICES FOLKS TOMORROW TO SEE WHAT THEIR LIMITS ARE WITH REGARD TO OUR STANDARD SPECIFICATIONS, OTHERWISE KNOWN AS THE ORANGE BOOK WITH REGARD TO GETTING A SIDEWALK INSTALLED HERE, WHICH WOULD BASICALLY BE ON PRIVATE PROPERTY, BUT COULD HAVE IT -- AN ACCESS ON TOP OF IT. AN ACCESS EASEMENT REQUIRES THE WILLINGNESS OF A PROPERTY OWNER.
01:19:15.988: >> Vice Chair Mills: AND SO I GUESS THIS IS A QUESTION FOR THE PETITIONER. I MEAN IS THAT -- HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT HAVING A SIDEWALK THERE? OR, LIKE -- THIS IS SOMETHING IN MY MIND THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHAT IS BUILT THERE NOW, WHAT WE ARE BUILDING TODAY WILL BE THERE HOPEFULLY 50 YEARS. HOPEFULLY 100 YEARS FROM NOW AND SO I -- YOU KNOW, I RECOGNIZE THAT THAT CONSTRAINS, YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE GOT CONSTRAINTS TO THE WEST, CLEARLY, THERE'S A HILL. AND I RECOGNIZE THAT THAT WOULD CONSTRAIN WHAT HAPPENS TO THE EAST. I FEEL LIKE THIS IS THE TIME, BUT IF YOU -- IF THE HOUSE IS EFFECTIVELY RIGHT WHERE YOU WOULD -- WHERE -- THE OWN PLACE WHERE A SIDEWALK WOULD BE LEFT, THEN -- THEN IT'S NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN. AND THAT'S A CONCERN TO -- FOR ME. SO I --
01:20:04.203: >> I CAN'T SPEAK FOR THE -- BUT SO HE OWNS THE THREE PROPERTIES TO THE SOUTH AND THERE'S A -- THERE IS A SIDEWALK ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THOSE. SO I'M SURE HE'S GOING TO WANT TO CONTINUE IT TO OUR FOURTH PROPERTY AS IT IS NOW, BECAUSE THE SIDEWALK ACTUALLY GOES ALL THE WAY TO THE DRIVEWAY. I'M SURE THAT THERE WILL BE A SIDEWALK THAT WILL GO TO THE EDGE OF THE PROPERTY LINE. THAT SIDEWALK WILL CONTINUE, THE EXISTING ONE THAT'S IN FRONT OF 1039, 1035 AND 1043, WILL CONTINUE THROUGH -- OR 1042, WILL THEN CONTINUE ON TO THIS PROPERTY WHICH IS 1043.
01:20:50.917: >> Vice Chair Mills: GOT IT. TYPICALLY WHEN WE ARE DOING REZONINGS BECAUSE IT TENDS TO BE MORE BIGGER THINGS IT COMES WITH A STAFF PLAN. IS THERE ANY WAY, STAFF, JEFF OR BRETT, THAT WE CAN, AGAIN, JUST LIKE MAKE SURE THAT THAT IS -- THAT IF THE REZONING IS APPROVED, THAT ANY DEVELOPMENT THAT HAPPENS THERE WOULD GET THE SIDEWALK?
01:21:17.109: >> Planning Manager:  NO. I DON'T -- THE SCALE OF THIS SEEMS -- THE SCALE OF THIS SEEMS INAPPROPRIATE FOR THE SORT OF ZONING MECHANISMS THAT WOULD ALIGN WITH CONDITIONS OR THE LIKE. SO -- BUT AS JEFF INDICATED, AND AS PRECEDENT SUGGESTS, SIDEWALKS ARE CONSTRUCTED WHEN DEVELOPMENT HAPPENS ALONG HERE. IT IS PROPERTY OF OUR STANDARDS PROCEDURES, I AM, OF COURSE, HAPPY TO FOLLOW-UP WITH OUR PUBLIC SERVICES JUST TO ADVOCATE FOR THE SORT OF IMPORTANCE OF THAT. AND FURTHERMORE, THIS IS A REZONING. WE COULD -- WE COULD EMPHASIZE THAT AS PART OF ANY RECOMMENDATION THAT YOU CHOOSE TO MAKE, AND -- AND THAT WOULD GIVE THE PETITIONER AND PROPERTY OWNER THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROBABLY RESPOND TO THAT MORE FULLY BEFORE IT PROGRESSES TO CITY COUNCIL IN A MORE DEFINITIVE MANNER. WE WILL MIGHT BE ABLE TO MAKE SOME OF THE STEPS IN ADVANCE, JUST TO, YOU KNOW -- IF -- FOR EXAMPLE, PUBLIC ACCESS EASEMENT IS REQUIRED OR WHAT HAVE YOU. THAT WOULD GIVE US THE TIME TO START PUTTING THAT INTO PLACE. SO I -- I -- I THINK THAT I AM COMFORTABLE RELYING ON OUR STANDARD SPECIFICATIONS AND OUR GOALS AS THE CITY, THAT -- THAT THERE IS A RELIEF VALVE IN THAT, BUT, AGAIN, I DON'T THINK THAT TRADITIONAL ALONG THIS CORRIDOR HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT THERE'S BEEN A QUICK WILLINGNESS TO INVOKE THAT FOR THESE DEVELOPMENTS. SO DOES THAT HELP AT ALL?
01:22:53.039: >> Vice Chair Mills: YEAH, I MEAN, I KNOW I FOR ONE, JUST IN TERMS OF, LIKE, PASSING THIS ALONG, I DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S WORTH HOLDING IT UP NOW, BUT SENDING THE MESSAGE THAT IF THAT PUBLIC ACCESS EASEMENT IS -- I WOULD FEEL A WHOLE LOT MORE COMFORTABLE VOTING FOR THE REZONING IF I KNEW THAT THAT -- [ NO AUDIO ] THAT THE OWNER OF THE PROPERTY WAS WILLING TO HAVE THAT THERE. BECAUSE IN MY MIND, LIKE, THAT ENSURES THAT -- EVEN IF IT DOESN'T GET BUILT, IF FOR WHATEVER REASON, YOU KNOW, THE SIDEWALK UNIT DECIDES THAT IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO REQUIRE THE -- [ NO AUDIO ] THE FUTURE. I THINK THAT THAT'S THE REALLY IMPORTANT PART.
01:23:38.250: >> Planning Manager:  SO YOU KNOW, AS A RECOMMENDATION, YOU COULD SIMPLY ADD THAT. YOU COULD SAY THAT, YOU KNOW, IF YOU CHOOSE TO RECOMMEND THIS REZONING, THAT -- THAT YOU WOULD ALSO RECOMMEND THAT THE OWNER COMMIT TO MEETING THE CITY'S SPECIFICATIONS AND ENSURE A PUBLIC SIDEWALK, CONTINUES ALONG THAT SITE. I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT'S NOT 100%, EVEN WITH THAT, IT'S NOT GOING TO BE 100%, BUT BASED ON WHAT THE PETITIONER IS INDICATING AND THE HISTORY OF THE PROPERTY OWNERS, INSTALLS IT AND OTHER PROPERTIES, I JUST -- I JUST SEE THE RISK AS RELATIVELY LOW.
01:24:17.556: >> Vice Chair Mills: YEAH, I GUESS THERE'S SO MANY LIKE -- YOU NEVER KNOW. DEVELOPMENT IS EXPENSIVE. ANYWAY. I WOULD FEEL -- I WOULD FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE KNOWING THAT ALL OF OUR Ts WERE CROSSED AND Is WERE DOTTED AND THAT THE CITY -- THAT THAT AGREEMENT WERE MADE. I WOULD WELCOME OTHERS THOUGHTS AND OTHER COMMISSIONERS' THOUGHTS AND BRETT, IS THAT APPROPRIATE AS AN AMENDMENT OR IS THAT LIKE A SEPARATE THING THAT WE WOULD -- A SEPARATE RESOLUTION. LIKE, I'M NOT SURE WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE.
01:24:58.631: >> Planning Manager:  WE WILL JUST AMEND THE MOTION AND BASICALLY, YOU ARE ADDING A CONDITION TO YOUR RECOMMENDATION.
01:25:05.738: >> Vice Chair Mills: RIGHT. OKAY. I'M LEANING TOWARDS DOING THAT. I GOT TO SCRAMBLE TO FIND SOME PAPER TO MAKE THAT -- TO WRITE IT OUT, BUT I WILL HEAR WHAT OTHERS SAY.
01:25:17.082: >> Chair Milshteyn: MEANWHILE, START ING AND COMMISSIONER BRIGGS THIS.
01:25:27.760: >> Commissioner Briggs: I WASN'T GOING TO SPEAK YET. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO HAS OTHER COMMENTS?
01:25:33.933: >> Chair Milshteyn: GO AHEAD. I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER HANDS GOING UP.
01:25:38.404: >> Commissioner Briggs: I THINK WHAT I'M STRUCKL STRUGGLING WITE MOST -- I LOVE SIDEWALKS. I DO -- I'M CONCERNED WITH THE LOGIC AND BUILDING AND LOCATION. THIS IS NOT MY AREA OF EXPERTISE. I'M CERTAINLY WILLING TO TAKE OTHERS THOUGHTS ON THIS, BUT IT SEEMS -- I'M NOT SO MUCH CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT THE CALLY IT OF THE -- THE QUALITY OF THE WOODS ARE THERE, 50 YEARS AGO OR 70 YEARS AGO. IT'S MORE THAT THIS IS A REALLY STEEP SLOPE AND WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE A NATURAL PARK, THE BLUFFS THAT'S RIGHT THERE AND IT'S ADJACENT. IT SEEMS APPROPRIATE -- IT JUST SEEMS THAT IF THERE WEREN'T A HOUSE HERE ALREADY, WE WOULDN'T POSSIBLY BE CONSIDERING HOUSING IN THIS KIND OF LOCATION. AM I WRONG ABOUT THAT? # IT JUST -- AGRICULTURE -- IT'S OBVIOUSLY NOT -- A SPACE IT'S NOT A SPACE FOR AGRICULTURE EXACTLY, BUT IT DOES SEEM LIKE AN AREA THAT WE MIGHT PRESERVE OPEN SPACE IF THAT HOUSE WAS NOT THERE OR SOME PLACE THAT IT MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE FOR THE CITY TO RECOGNIZE THAT IT'S -- THAT THAT SHOULD BE BROUGHT INTO THEIR ASSETS, CONSIDERING WHAT THE IMPACT MIGHT BE TO THE PROPERTY OWNER FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO BUILD THIS. SO JUST MORE THOUGHTS ON THAT, I GUESS.
01:27:21.974: >> Chair Milshteyn: SO MY --
01:27:22.574: >> Planning Manager:  JEFF, COULD YOU JUST RESUMMARIZE THE MASTER PLAN FOR THIS PROPERTY.
01:27:29.715: >> A SINGLE TWO FAMILY HOMES FOR THIS PROPERTY, AND RELATED TO WHAT COMMISSIONER BRIGGS WAS SAYING. THIS HAD HUMAN HABITATION FOR PROBABLY OVER A CENTURY. THESE HOMES WERE PROBABLY CONSTRUCTED WHEN THIS WAS A DIRT ROAD, SOMETIME PROBABLY IN THE EARLY 20th CENTURY. SO THE AG ZONING DISTRICT IS, YOU KNOW, CLEARLY AN ANOMALY. IT MAY HAVE BEEN -- IT MAY HAVE BEEN -- IT MAY HAVE BEEN PART OF A PREVIOUS AGRICULTURAL HOLDING BUT IT CERTAINLY -- 6,000 SQUARE FOOT AG SITE DOESN'T MAKE A WHOLE LOT OF SENSE. THE R4C TO THE SOUTH DOES ALLOW FOR DIFFERENT USES. AND SUCH AS MAYBE TOWNHOME USES OR STACK FLAT USES, BUT THAT'S A TOUGH SITE ON WHICH TO DEVELOP. SO, YOU KNOW, CITY STAFF HAS ONLY CERTAIN LIMITATIONS WITH HOW WE CAN PROCEED WITH REGARD TO LAND PRESERVATION OR GETTING THE EXACT PERFECT PROJECT THAT WE WANT WE DO ALLOW PETITIONERS TO BUILD SINGLE FAMILY HOMES WHERE IT'S APPROPRIATE. AND IT'S DIFFICULT TO SAY NO IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS, WHICH IS WHY WE RECOMMEND APPROVAL.
01:29:06.678: >> Planning Manager:  AND COMMISSIONER BRIGGS, I WOULD JUST -- THANKS FOR THAT, JEFF. THE MASTER PLAN IS OUR FIRST PLACE. THAT IS WHERE WE GO TO. THAT'S WHERE THE CITY IS SET TO ADOPT THESE POLICIES. IT'S BEEN AFFIRMED BY YOU, THIS COMMISSION OVER TIME. BUT, YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHY WE ARE ASKING FOR YOUR OPINION AS WELL. YOU KNOW, OCCASIONALLY PROJECTS COME UP WHERE THE CONDITIONS HAVE MAYBE CHANGED IN SUCH A DRAMATIC WAY WHERE YOU QUESTION THE VALIDITY LAND USE THAT'S HOUSED IN THE MASTER PLAN. YOU KNOW, I AGREE WITH A LOT OF POINTS YOU ARE SAYING. AND I GUESS I WANT TO BE CLEAR, WE ARE DOING OUR BEST TO APPLY THE POLICY DECISIONS AND BALANCE SO IF FOR SOME REASON YOU FELT THAT THAT LAND USE POLICY WAS NOT RELEVANT THEN I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO MAKE SURE YOU VOTE IN THE WAY THAT YOU FEEL AND THINK ABOUT -- IF YOU DO SO, IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL TO ARTICULATE, YOU KNOW, WHAT WHAT ARE THE CHANGES OR OTHER ASPECTS OF THE MASTER PLAN THAT YOU DON'T THINK WOULD BE FURTHERED BY THAT? OBVIOUSLY FROM A STAFF PERSPECTIVE, WE FELT THAT ON BALANCE THIS PROPOSED REZONING DOES FIT THAT, GIVEN THE LONG-TERM HISTORIC USE OF THE SITE AND POTENTIAL FOR IN YOU USE. ITS MODERATE IN THE CONTEXT OF SOME OF THE FACTORS OF THAT MART PARTICULAR LOCATION. SO --
01:30:55.187: >> Chair Milshteyn: SO PERSONALLY, I -- I'M IN FAVOR OF THIS REZONING. PART OF THE REASON WHY I'M IN FAVOR OF IT IS THIS STRETCH OF NORTH MAIN IS THE GATEWAY INTO THE CITY FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE AND IT'S NOT ATTRACTIVE RIGHT NOW. IT HASN'T BEEN FOR A VERY LONG TIME AND I KNOW THERE'S BEEN TALK AND THIS IS AN INCREMENTAL MOVE. BUT I THINK IT'S P IT'S A GOOD N THAT DIRECTION. I LIKE THE IDEA OF A SIDEWALK. SO I LOOK FORWARD TO COMMISSIONER MILLS' MOTION IN REGARDS TO THAT. I HAVE LISTED AND SOLD THE PROPERTY COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL THAT YOU HAVE MENTIONED AT 1329 NORTH MAIN, WHICH IS JUST RIGHT NEAR THE ENTRANCE TO M14, AND THAT SIDEWALK, OBVIOUSLY IS NOT HEAVILY USED BECAUSE IT'S NOT -- THERE'S NOTHING CONNECTING THERE BUT AT SOME POINT, I DO HOPE THAT SOMETHING CONNECTS THERE. FOR NOW IT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT TO PUT A FOR SALE SIGN SINCE IT'S ALL CONCRETE IN FRONT OF THAT HOUSE, BUT I'M IN FAVOR OF THIS, AND I -- I WILL BE VOTING IN FAVOR OF THIS THIS EVENING. COMMISSIONER SAUVE?
01:32:09.661: >> Commissioner Sauve: THANK YOU. I HAVE A PRACTICAL QUESTION. IF WE DON'T REZONE, THE REZONE APPLICATION NOTES TO DEMOLISHED CONDEMNED HOME AND BUILD A NEW SINGLE FAMILY. SO I'M ALSO JUST CURIOUS ABOUT COULD THEY RENOVATE THIS HOME THAT ENCROACHES ON THE SETBACKS, AND THE PROPERTY LINES WITHOUT REZONING. TO WHAT DETRIMENT DO WE NOT REZONE THIS AND GET A SINGLE FAMILY HOME VERSUS REZONE IT AND GET A WELL SITED SINGLE FAMILY HOME?
01:32:43.662: >> I COULD TRY TO START WITH THAT RESPONSE AND THEN MAYBE MR. FOWLER CAN ADD WHAT HE KNOWS ABOUT THE FUTURE OR THE PROPOSED HOME ON THIS SITE. THE HOME, AS FAR AS WE CAN TELL, IS SO FAR TO THE EAST THAT A PORTION OF IT SITS WITHIN THE MDOT RIGHT-OF-WAY. AND IT'S -- AS FAR AS I CAN TELL, IT'S PRETTY FAR DOWN THE LINE OF NOT BEING IN GOOD SHAPE, MR. MR. FOWLER CAN SHED SOME LIGHT AS FAR AS REHABILITATION OF THE HOME. I DON'T BELIEVE THE HOME HAS BEEN CONDEMNED, ALTHOUGH PRETTY MAY KNOW SOMETHING THAT I DON'T. BUT MAYBE M MR. FOWLER CAN SHED LIGHT ON THE POTENTIAL FOR -- FOR RECONSTRUCTING THE HOUSE OR INNOVATING THE HOUSE, AS WELL AS WHAT THE PROPOSED HOUSE MIGHT LOOK LIKE.
01:33:49.828: >> MY EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN PULLING PERMITS FOR ACE HOUSE THAT -- FOR A HOUSE THAT'S NON-CONFORMING GREATLY LIMITS HOW MUCH WE CAN REMODEL A HOUSE. SO -- SO EVEN TO REMODEL THE HOUSE AND HAVE IT ZONED AGRICULTURAL, MY HANDS WOULD BE TIED TO DO ANYTHING SIGNIFICANT TO THE HOUSE. I GUESS WHAT I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND, IF WE DO NOTHING, IT'S NO THE L NOTHING, IT'S NOTE ARE GOING TO SEE THE HOUSE DEMOLISHED AND REVERTED TO NATURAL FEATURES. BUT WHAT WE MIGHT SEE IS A LESSER QUALITY HOME AND -- LOOKING AT THE TRADEOFFS. NOT TO PASS THIS WOULD BE A LOWER QUALITY RENOVATION POSSIBLY. VERSUS PASSING THIS AND ALLOWING FOR A NEW SINGLE FAMILY HOME ON THE SITE IS REALLY WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT AS OPTIONS?
01:34:58.663: >> Planning Manager:  YES, I WOULD AS ADD AS A NON-CONFORMING STRUCTURE TO DO ANYTHING OF SUBSTANCE WOULD REQUIRE APPROVAL FROM ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS TO ALTER A NON-CONFORMING STRUCTURE. SO THAT WOULD BE AN UNKNOWN. THAT WOULD NOT PROVIDE EXCEPTION FROM LIMITATIONS BUT IT WOULD BE A PRECURSOR TO DO RENOVATIONS TO THE PROPERTY. THAT SAID, I THINK OFTEN -- THEY ARE CONSIDERED ON A PROPERTY-BY-PROPERTY BASIS, BUT I KNOW THEY DON'T ISSUE MANY SUCH APPROVALS FOR THAT KIND OF ENKNOW VACATION, BUT IT ALSO STILL HAS SOME LIMITING EFFECT FROM OVERALL CONFORMITY OF THE DISTRICT GOING FORWARD. SO SO IN SHORT, I THINK THAT THE PROPERTY MIGHT BE ABLE TO BE MAINTAINED, BUT THAT WOULD BE A DECISION OF A LOT OF FACTORS SUCH AS THE INTEREST OF THE OWNER, THE VIABILITY OF THE RETAINING THE STRUCTURE, THOSE ASPECTS OF THE STRUCTURE, FOR EXAMPLE, IF IT'S IN THE RIGHT-OF-WAY THAT MAY NOT -- THAT MAY NOT SUPPORT APPROVAL OR EXPANSION OF IT. SO THERE ARE AVENUES BY WHICH THAT STUCTURE OR A STRUCTURE COULD REMAIN ABSENT REZONING THAT COULD PROVIDE FOR A SORT OF DIFFERENT BUILDING ENVELOPE.
01:36:38.063: >> Commissioner Sauve: OKAY. AND IT SEEMS LIKE WE ARE LOOKING AT THE WAYS FORWARD FOR A SINGLE FAMILY HOUSE IN A LOT OF WAYS AND I THINK REZONING THIS FEELS LIKE THE APPROPRIATE FIT TO ALIGN THIS WITH EVERYTHING ELSE, AND IF WE CAN PUSH FORWARD WITH A SIDEWALK, IT JUST MAKES A CORRIDOR AND A RIVER FRONT DISTRICT THAT'S BEEN ABANDONED FOR A LONG TIME OR AT LEAST NEGLECTED. IT GIVES IT, YOU KNOW, ONE MORE PROPERTY TO SHOW THAT THE COMMUNITY IS TRYING TO IMPROVE IT. SO --
01:37:12.197: >> Chair Milshteyn: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT.
01:37:15.100: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: I JUST HAVE A POINT OF CLARIFICATION. I NOTICED IN THE APPLICATION -- YOU SAID THE DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT IS A 2300 SQUARE FOOT HOME AND THEN A DETACHED GARAGE. DID YOU SAY THAT THE GARAGE IS ACTUALLY BEING BUILT ON THE ADJACENT PROPERTY AND THIS WOULD JUST BE THE HOUSE? ON THIS, THE GARAGE WILL BE UNDERNEATH TO THE NEW HOME, SIMILAR TO THE HOUSE DOWN THE STREET THAT WAS MENTIONED, JUST BECAUSE THE ELEVATION -- OUR GARAGE, YOU WOULD DRIVE RIGHT INTO THE GARAGE. SO NOW THIS WILL HAVE -- THE HOME WE ARE STILL WORKING ON PLANS DEPENDING ON WHAT HAPPENS, WILL HAVE ITS OWN GARAGE.
01:38:06.151: >> ATTACHED GARAGE.
01:38:07.886: >> AND THAT WILL BE ON THE BASEMENT LEVEL, SO TO SPEAK AND THEN WE GO UP WITH THE -- WITH THE LIVING LEVEL. SO WE WANT TO GET ABOVE MAIN STREET SO YOU CAN OUT IN THE RIVER, BECAUSE THAT'S -- THAT'S WHERE THE VIEW IS.
01:38:24.602: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: YEAH. YEAH, I'M PERSONALLY VERY CURIOUS WHAT YOU WILL COME UP WITH FOR THE SLOPE. AND I'M ALSO IN SUPPORT OF THIS SIDEWALK RECOMMENDATION.
01:38:36.014: >> AND, YOU KNOW, I DON'T -- I -- I -- I THINK THE SIDEWALK IS -- WOULD HELP OUR PROPERTY VALUES TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.
01:38:43.455: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: YEAH.
01:38:44.689: >> I DON'T SEE ANY REASON THAT THERE -- THAT THERE IS GOING TO BE AN ISSUE WITH US PUTTING A SIDEWALK IN THERE. AGAIN, WE WANT TO CONNECT ALL FOUR PROPERTIES TOGETHER.
01:38:53.331: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: MM-HMM.
01:38:54.199: >> BECAUSE IT'S THE SAME OWNER. SO I -- THE SIDEWALK IS NOT GOING TO BE A PROPER FOR US.
01:39:02.907: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: OKAY. ALL RIGHT. THAT WILL BE NICE TO SEE SOMETHING OTHER THAN WHAT EXISTS CURRENTLY. THANK YOU.
01:39:19.891: >> Chair Milshteyn: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COMMISSIONER WOODS? YOU NEED TO UNMUTE YOURSELF.
01:39:24.029: >> Commissioner Woods: UP MUTE. OKAY -- UNMUTE. OKAY. I'M IN FAVOR OF THE SIDEWALK. SO THANK YOU, COMMISSIONER MILLS, FOR WORKING ON THAT. I'M ALSO, YOU KNOW, CERTAINLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE SLOPES IN THE BACK, BUT I THINK IN THIS CASE, THE FACT THAT THERE'S ALREADY A HOME THERE AND GETTING A SINGLE FAMILY HOME THERE, I THINK IS SOMING THAT WILL HOPEFULLY MAKE THAT -- IS SOMETHING THAT WILL HOPEFULLY MAKE THE ENTRY INTO THE CITY BETTER AS WELL. SO I'M IN FAVOR OF IT.
01:39:55.860: >> Chair Milshteyn: GREAT. COMMISSIONER MILLS? COMMISSIONER BRIGGS BEFORE WE -- YEAH. COMMISSIONER BRIGGS.
01:40:06.304: >> Commissioner Briggs: I APPRECIATE THE TALK. YOU TALKED ME INTO WHY THIS WAS THE APPROPRIATE ZONING AND I STILL HAVE SOME CONCERNED IN MY IDEAL WORLD OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN THERE, WHICH IS UNLIKELY TO HAPPEN. SO I WILL VOTE IN FAVOR, EVEN THOUGH I HAVE SOME RESERVATIONS ABOUT THIS AND COULD IMAGINE A DIFFERENT FUTURE FOR IT. THIS SEEMS LIKE THE ONLY ONE THAT WILL HAPPEN.
01:40:33.164: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER MILLS.
01:40:38.203: >> Vice Chair Mills: I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE AN AMENDMENT. I HAVE BEEN GOOGLE STREETVIEWING THIS TOO AND THERE'S A SIDEWALK THAT GOES HALF TO THE PROPERTY. SO THIS IS WHY YOU WILL SEE I TALK ABOUT HAVING AN EASEMENT ALONG THE ENTIRETY OF THE NORTH MAIN FRONTAGE. I DON'T THINK THAT FIRST HALF IS THE SOUTHERN HALF IS CONTROVERSIAL. IT'S ALREADY THERE. IT'S KIND OF JUST CONTINUING THAT ON, MAKING SURE THAT THAT IS THERE SO THE AMENDMENT THAT I WOULD PROPOSE IS JUST TACKING ON TO THE END OF THE EXISTING RESOLUTION, SUBJECT TO THE PROPERTY OWNER COMMITTING A PUBLIC ACCESS EASEMENT FOR A SIDEWALK ALONG THE ENTIRETY OF THE NORTH MAIN FRONTAGE.
01:41:22.080: >> Chair Milshteyn: DO YOU HAVE A COMMISSIONER WHO WILL SECOND THAT? SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER BRIGGS.
01:41:28.620: >> Vice Chair Mills: I WELCOME WORDSMITHING BY MR. LENART IF I DIDN'T PICK UP THE RIGHT WORDS COMMITTING THE SIDEWALK EASEMENT.
01:41:40.231: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN.
01:41:41.166: >> Councilmember Ackerman: AND MAKING SURE THAT IT INCLUDES PRESERVATION OR THE EXTENSION OF THE SIDEWALK. SO IT'S BOTH THE PUBLIC EASEMENT, AS WELL AS THE CONSTRUCTION SHOULD THAT BE NEEDED.
01:42:05.623: >> I ALSO WANT A SIDEWALK AND THIS IS ALONG THE MDOT RIGHT-OF-WAY. AND THAT NEEDS TO BE VETTED AGAINST THAT. SO THEY ARE ONLY GOING TO LET YOU DO THAT. I THINK THE CITY FOLKS NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE LIMITATIONS ARE WITH THAT. AND SO MAYBE THAT GETS ADDED INTO THE LANGUAGE SOMEHOW. I KNOW I HAD A PROPERTY THAT I WORKED ON FURTHER UP MAIN STREET AND WE HAD TO DO A WHOLE SPECIAL SUBMISSION TO MDOT WITH ANYTHING IN THE RIGHT-OF-WAY IN THAT AREA. AND SO ANYWAY, I JUST -- YOU CAN SEE IF YOU LOOK AT THE PERHAPS IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO CHAIR THE SCREEN WHERE WE ARE LOOKING AT THE SURVEY THAT SHOWED THE YELLOW RESIDENTS. AND THEN I THINK YOU ALL WILL SEE WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. IT'S AT THE END OF SO YOU CAN SEE WHERE THE EDGE OF THE ROAD ACTUALLY IS. YES. SO SO THE ROAD IS REALLY LIGHT. IT'S A LITTLE BIT BETTER IN THE STAFF REPORT. YOU CAN SEE THE EDGE OF THE ROAD IS THIS REALLY LIGHT LINE. YEAH, THERE YOU GO AND THAT DRIVEWAY IS COMPLETELY THE IN MIDDLE OF THE MDOT RIGHT-OF-WAY AND, IN FACT, EXISTING SIDEWALK THAT GOES IN FRONT OF THOSE HOUSES IS ALSO IN THE MDOT RIGHT-OF-WAY. AND THEY BASICALLY GET TO DO WHATEVER THEY WANT IN THAT 66-FOOT AREA. SO I WOULD JUST LIKE PLANNING STAFF TO BE ABLE TO DO A LITTLE BIT MORE DIGGING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT OUR OPTIONS REALLY ARE IN TERMS OF WHAT WE SAY WE WANT THEM TO DO IN THIS AREA. BECAUSE WE MAY BE SOMETHING THAT IS ACTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO DO. SO IF YOU GUYS COULD JUST DO A LITTLE VETTING ON WHAT THAT ACTUALLY MEANS. SO THAT WE ARE NOT PROMISING SOMETHING THAT THEN IN THE END ENDS UP GETTING OVERTURNED BECAUSE OF WHAT MDOT HAS TO SAY ABOUT THAT.
01:44:23.227: >> Planning Manager:  I WOULD SAY THE MOTION AS IT EXISTS, IT IS -- IT IS -- IT SORT OF DOESN'T HAVE THE CAVEAT, BUT, AGAIN, IT'S A RECOMMENDATION. I THINK THAT'S A GREAT POINT. WE ARE HAPPY TO WORK WITH TRANSPORTATION AND ENGINEERING AND THE LIKE TO -- IF THIS PROCEEDS TO CITY COUNCIL, WE CAN ANSWER THAT AS DEFINITIVELY AS WE CAN. THAT SAID, I DOUBT WE WILL HAVE MDOT APPROVAL.
01:44:51.589: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: OH, NO, YOU WON'T.
01:44:53.224: >> Planning Manager:  WE WILL HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT IS POSSIBLE. THIS MIGHT BE OPTIMISTIC BUT THE PRESENCE OF THE SIDEWALK TO THOSE OTHER PROPERTIES MAYBE IS A GOOD INDICATOR THAT THERE IS A SUPPORT BY MDOT TO DO SO. I KNOW THAT MDOT HAS SORT OF IDENTIFIED IMPROVEMENTS ALONG THIS CORRIDOR IN THE COMING YEARS. WHO KNOWS HOW THAT -- WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW MIGHT AFFECT THAT. AND MY UNDERSTANDING WAS THEIR INITIAL THOUGHT -- THEIR INITIAL APPROACH WAS SORT OF VERY MUCH CURB-TO-CURB KIND OF APPROACH, WHICH WOULD SUGGEST THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOME OPPORTUNITY FOR WHAT HAPPENS IN THIS RIGHT-OF-WAY EXTENSION.
01:45:34.866: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: YEAH, AND THEN IF MR. FOWLER COULD PERHAPS DESCRIBE WHAT THEY ARE THINKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF PLACEMENT OF THE STRUCTURE, LIKE, HOW MUCH FURTHER BACK -- CLEARLY, YOU DON'T WANT TO BE IN THE MDOT RIGHT-OF-WAY, THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. WHERE DO YOU SEE YOURSELF PLACING THE STRUCTURE WITHIN THE LOT LINES JUST AS SOME SORT OF AN APPROXIMATE IDEA OF WHAT YOU ARE THINKING, ESPECIALLY GIVEN WHAT THE MDOT RIGHT-OF-WAY IS.
01:46:02.493: >> WELL, I'M GOING TO HAVE TO GET WITH THE ZONING TO SEE HOW FAR BACK -- IF THEY ARE GOING TO LET ME DO SOME AVERAGING LIKE THEY SOMETIMES DO. OBVIOUSLY, I WANT TO BE OUT OF MDOT'S WAY. I DON'T WANT TO GO BACK ANY FARTHER THAN I HAVE TO. I WILL GO FAR ENOUGH BACK SO THE GARAGE WOULD BE UNDERNEATH THE HOUSE AND THAT WAY, AGAIN, WE ARE RAISING UP THE LIVING QUARTER. THE LESS I HAVE TO PUSH BACK, THE LESS I HAVE TO CONTEND WITH THAT HILL. I MEAN, I KNOW -- BECAUSE IT IS -- IT'S FAIRLY FLAT FOR A WAYS AND THEN THE HILL GOES STRAIGHT UP. SO I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE SOME -- WE HAVE SOME SORT OF ROOM FOR A PATIO OR A DECK OR SOMETHING BEHIND THE HOUSE. SO I -- I'M GOING TO KEEP IT AS CLOSE TO THE FRONT PROPERTY LINE AS FEASIBLE.
01:47:19.470: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: AND SO I HAVE A SENSE THAT THERE'S SOME SORT OF SETBACKS AND THERE NEEDS TO BE A DRIVE THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO LIVE BEYOND ANY SORT OF MDOT IMPROVEMENT IN THERE. SO IT CAN'T -- THE FACE OF THE HOUSE CAN'T BE RIGHT AT THE CARS WHIZZING BY. SO HE WOULD HAVE SOME SORT OF GUIDANCE THEN, I PRESUME FROM THE CITY IN TERMS OF WHERE IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO PLACE THE STRUCTURE?
01:47:45.763: >> Planning Manager:  YES, IF IT'S REZONED IT WOULD HAVE TO MEET THE ZONING DESIGNATIONS OF THAT DISTRICT.
01:47:54.906: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: OKAY. THANK YOU.
01:47:56.474: >> Chair Milshteyn: FURTHER DISCUSSION ON THE AMENDMENT? ALL RIGHT. SEEING NO ONE, BRETT, DO YOU WANT TO DO A ROLL CALL VOTE ON THE AMENDMENT OR CAN WE DO A VOICE VOTE?
01:48:06.784: >> Planning Manager:  I THINK FOR THE AMENDMENT, A VOICE VOTE SEEMS FINE. I WOULD ASK THAT YOU ASK FOR THOSE IN SUPPORT AND FOR ANY THAT OPPOSE.
01:48:17.495: >> Chair Milshteyn: ALL RIGHT. ALL OF THOSE IN FAVOR, PLEASE SAY AYE. [CHORUS OF AYES] ANY OPPOSED, PLEASE SAY NAY. ALL RIGHT. THE AMENDMENT IS APPROVED. WE ARE BACK TO THE AMENDED MOTION. THE MAIN AMENDED MOTION. FURTHER DISCUSSION? SEEING NO ONE, I WILL CALL FOR A ROLL CALL VOTE.
01:48:43.220: >> Planning Manager:  OKAY. THISESTHE MAIN MOTION TO RECOMMEND THE REZONING WITH THE AMENDMENT TO THE PROPERTY OWNER COMMITTING TO ANY NECESSARY ACCESS AGREEMENT ALONG THE FRONTAGE AND MAINTENANCE AND CONSTRUCTION OF A PUBLIC SIDEWALK. COMMISSIONER WOODS.
01:49:06.177: >> Commissioner Woods: YES.
01:49:09.113: >> Commissioner Briggs: YES.
01:49:11.983: >> Vice Chair Mills: YES.
01:49:13.284: >> Chair Milshteyn: YES.
01:49:13.818: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: YES.
01:49:15.219: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES.
01:49:21.392: >> Commissioner Sauve: YES.
01:49:21.993: >> Commissioner Abrons:  YES.
01:49:22.660: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: YES.
01:49:24.996: >> Planning Manager:  THE MOTION CARRIES UNANIMOUSLY.
01:49:27.865: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU. WE ARE NOW MOVING ON TO THE NEXT ITEM ON OUR AGENDA, WHICH IS 9D, 950 GREENE STREET REVISED PLANT SCAPE PLAN. TREE MITIGATION PLAN, SITE PLAN FOR PLANNING COMMISSION APPROVAL. WE WILL BEGIN WITH THE PETITIONER PRESENTATION, AND WE'LL THEN HEAD TO A STAFF REPORT, A PUBLIC HEARING AND THEN DISCUSSION. SO WE WILL BEGIN WITH THE PETITIONER PRESENTATION. YOU WILL HAVE UP TO TEN MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
01:49:57.595: >> THAT'S GREAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE. MY NAME IS JENNIFER ROTH. I REPRESENT THE OWNER AND THE DEVELOPER FOR THE PROPERTY. MY ADDRESS IS 1 U 1 TOWN SQUAREN MICHIGAN. THE PROJECT -- AND MOST OF YOU ARE NEW FACES FOR ME. SO LAST YEAR, WE GOT APPROVAL FOR OUR MULTIFAMILY PROJECT. THE ADDRESS IS 950 GREENE. WE CALL IT HOOVER AND GREENE. AND IT INCORPORATES THE ENTIRE CITY BLOCK OF HOOVER, GREENE, BROWN, AND DAVIS. SO AS MOST OF YOU ARE FAMILIAR, IT WAS  AN ASSEMBLAGE OF 13 LOTS AND 12 STRUCTURES. SO WE STARTED CONSTRUCTION LAST YEAR, AND IN OUR ORIGINAL SITE PLAN, WE HAD TWO LAND MARK INDUSTRIES THAT WERE REMOVED AND UNFORTUNATELY, DURING OUR CONSTRUCTION PROCESS -- YES, THAT'S GREAT. THANK YOU. SO THE YELLOW HIGHLIGHTS THE ORIGINAL TWO TREES THAT WE HAD TO REMOVE DURING THE ORIGINAL SITE PLAN APPROVAL. AND THEN UNFORTUNATELY DURING OUR CONSTRUCTION, LAST YEAR IN OCTOBER, WE HAD TO REMOVE THE TWO THAT ARE HIGHLIGHTED IN GREEN THAT WE NOTE AS OUR AMENDED, WHICH IS TODAY. SO -- AND AS YOU CAN SEE, WE ARE THE FULL CITY BLOCK ON THIS -- ON THIS PROPERTY. SO WE INCORPORATE THE BLOCK. THE NEXT TAB REALLY GOES INTO THE TABLE OF WHAT WE HAVE DONE. SO THERE'S A COLUMN FOR THE ORIGINAL SITE PLAN, WHICH WERE THE TWO TREES THAT WERE REMOVED. AND THEN THE NEXT COLUMN IS THE AMENDED SITE PLAN, WHICH IS TODAY. BUT THE AMENDED SITE PLAN COLUMN INCORPORATED EVERYTHING FROM -- AS A TOTAL, SO IT INCLUDES EVERYTHING FROM THE ORIGINAL SITE PLAN AS WELL. SO IN OUR ORIGINAL SITE PLAN, WE REMOVED TWO, THE TOTAL IS NOW FOUR. INCLUDING THE TWO FROM THE ORIGINAL. SO IF YOU GO DOWN THE LIST, ON THE -- THE -- REALLY THE BOTTOM LINE, TOTAL NUMBER OF REPLACEMENT TREES PROVIDED. ON THE ORIGINAL SITE PLAN, WHEN WE REMOVED TWO TREES, WE HAD TO REPLACE 14. NOW, WITH THE AMENDED OF A TOTAL OF FOUR TREES BEING REMOVED, WE ARE ARE REPLACING THE FOUR TREES WITH 33 TREES TOTAL. 14 FROM THE ORIGINAL SITE PLAN AND AN ADDITIONAL 19 TREES FOR THE AMENDED SITE PLAN TO GIVE US THE 33 TREES. BACK WHEN THIS HAPPENED IN OCTOBER, WE WORKED WITH OUR -- WITH TIFFANY, PROBABLY SPENT THE ENTIRE MONTH OF NOVEMBER GOING THROUGH THE CORRECT SITE PLAN LAYOUT FOR THESE TREES. SHE HELPED US WITH THE SPECIFIC SPECIES OF THE TREES, OBVIOUSLY TO MAKE SURE BETWEEN THE COUNT, THE LOCATION AND THE SPECIES NATIVE TO THE AREA, WE CAME UP WITH THIS PLAN, WHICH WOULD BE THE NEXT TAB, IF YOU COULD. SO THIS IS THE OVERALL PLAN COLOR CODED. THE GREEN ARE THE 14 TREES, -- THE 14 MITIGATION FROM THE SITE PLAN. THE AND THESE ARE THE 10 TREES ON SITE AND THE BLUE ARE -- I'M SORRY, THE PURPLE IS THE OFFSITE TREES. THERE ARE 10 OF THEM AND THEN THE BLUE ARE THE S NINE TREES. ALL IN TOTAL FOR THE FOUR LANDMARK TREES THAT ARE REMOVED, WE ARE PLANTING 33 TREES TOTAL ON THE SITE.
01:54:04.441: >> Chair Milshteyn: GREAT. THANK YOU. WE WILL NOW HEAD TO MR. KAHAN FOR A STAFF REPORT.
01:54:19.456: >> JEFF, YOU ARE MUTED.
01:54:23.894: >> THANK YOU. JUST WANTED TO REITERATE WHAT JENNIFER HAS SAID, THE PETITIONER IS REQUIRED TO MITIGATE FOR A TOTAL OF 126 INCHES OF TREE DIAMETER THAT REFLECTS THE REMOVAL OF A TOTAL OF FOUR LANDMARK TREES, TWO THAT WERE ANTICIPATED TO BE REMOVED AS PART OF THE ORIGINAL@SITE ORIGINAL SITEPLAN AND TWO THAT D DURING CONSTRUCTION. SO THE TWO TREES THAT WERE NOT ANTICIPATED TO BE REMOVED ARE REQUIRED TO BE REPLACED AT 200% INSTEAD OF THE 50% IF THERM ANTICIPATED. SO THAT'S THE QUICK SUMMARY OF WHAT IS BEING PROPOSED. STAFF DOES RECOMMEND APPROVAL OF THIS PARTICULAR REVISION, WHICH AMENDS THE NATURAL FEATURES MITIGATION PLAN, AND THE LANDSCAPING PLAN BECAUSE IT COMPLIES WITH ALL APPLICABLE, LOCAL, STATE, AND FEDERAL ORDINANCES, STANDARDS AND REGULATIONS, AND IT WILL NOT CAUSE A PUBLIC OR PRIVATE NUISANCE AND IT WILL NOT HAVE A DETRIMENTAL EFFECT ON PUBLIC SAFETY HEALTH AND WELFARE. I WANT TO MENTION THAT TIFFANY JAKOBOZI WORKED MOST EXTENSIVELY WITH JENNIFER ROTH. TIFFANY OFFERED TO BE AVAILABLE IF WE HAD ANY SPECIFIC TECHNICAL QUESTIONS FOR HER AND I CAN REACH HER BY CELL PHONE.
01:55:52.182: >> Chair Milshteyn: GREAT. THANK YOU. AT THIS TIME, I WOULD LIKE TO OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PERSONS TO SPEAK FOR UP TO THREE MINUTES ABOUT THIS APPLICATION. TO COMMENT, PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS FOR THE RECORD. THE PUBLIC COMMENT WILL BE LEAD BY PHONE AT THE NUMBER APPEARING ON THE PUBLISHED AGENDA AND DISPLAYED ON MEETING'S VIDEO FEED. IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IF SPEAKING AT THIS TIME, PLEASE CALL MEETING WITH THE INFORMATION PROVIDED. CITY STAFF WILL SELECT CALLERS THAT HAVE RAISED THEIR HAND ONE BY ONE, USING THE LAST THREE DIGITS OF YOUR PHONE NUMBER. IN ORDER TO ELECTRONICALLY RAISE YOUR HAND, TO SPEAK, PLEASE PRESS STAR NINE ON YOUR PHONE. THAT'S STAR NINE ON YOUR PHONE.
01:56:37.528: >> HI, CALLER 750, YOU MAY GO AHEAD.
01:56:40.431: >> HELLO, PLANNING COMMISSION. THIS IS JULIE WEATHERBEE FROM SOUTH MAIN STREET. AND I JUST WANTED TO COMMENT. THIS ISN'T SO MUCH ON THIS PARTICULAR -- WHAT HAS BEEN DECIDED ON THIS PARTICULAR SITE BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS -- THEY HAVE DONE A GOOD  JOB. THERE'S A LOT GOING ON AND THEY WORKED HARD ON THIS. JENNIFER HAS BEEN GREAT TO WORK WITH. AND I'M GLAD THAT SHE'S OPEN THIS PROJECT. AS A NEARBY NEIGHBOR, YOU KNOW, WE DEFINITELY -- WE DEFINITELY APPRECIATE HER WORK ON THIS. ONE THE THINGS THAT HAS -- I HAVE NOTICED, THOUGH, IN LOOKING AT THE SITE AND THESE TREES -- AND THIS IS MAYBE JUST SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT FOR FUTURE SITES, BECAUSE, AGAIN, I DON'T WANT TO DERAIL THIS ONE. I KNOW A LOT OF WORK HAS GONE INTO IT, BUT THIS BLOCK NOW IS VERY TREED! AND THAT'S GREAT. I DON'T -- I DON'T WANT TO, YOU KNOW, DISCOURAGE THAT, BUT WHAT'S HAPPENED IS DURING THE CONSTRUCTION, A LOT OF THE STREET TREES ON THE ADJACENT AREAS, LIKE ACROSS THE STREET, HAVE GOTTEN DAMAGED BY CONSTRUCTION VEHICLES, AND SO NOW THIS BLOCK IS VERY TREED, AND ACROSS THE STREET ARE VERY KIND OF DAMAGED STREET TREES WITH LIMBS THAT HAVE HAD TO BE HACKED OFF, AND SO I'M JUST WONDERING IN FUTURE SITES, IF WE CAN KIND OF LOOK AT THE -- THE AREA AROUND THESE CONSTRUCTION SITES THAT MAYBE ARE IMPACTED BY THE BIG CONSTRUCTION TRUCKS, AND NOT JUST PLANT TREES RIGHT ON THE SITE ITSELF, WHICH IS NOW GOING TO BE VERY FULLY TRE AND THE AREA AROUND -- YOU KNOW, ACROSS THE STREETS WILL HAVE HALF OF A STREET TREE EVERY SO OFTEN. THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY AND IT'S LOVELY SEEING YOU ALL. YOU ARE DOING A GREAT JOB AND ZOOM IS WORKING WELL. HAVE A GREAT NIGHT AND I WILL CHECK IN WITH YOU LATER. BYE.
01:58:46.290: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU, MS. WEATHERBEE. IT WAS GOOD TO HEAR YOUR VOICE. IS THERE ANYBODY ELSE WHO WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION? IF SO, PLEASE PRESS STAR NINE ON YOUR TELEPHONE. SEEING NO ONE, I WILL CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING AND I WILL READ THE MOTION. THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION HEREBY APPROVES THE 950 GREENE SITE PLAN FOR PLANNING COMMISSION -- FOR PLANNING COMMISSION UPDATING THE NATURAL FEATURES MITIGATION PLAN AND THE LANDSCAPING PLAN. MOVED BY COMMISSIONER MILLS, SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER WOODS. DISCUSSION? COMMISSIONER MILLS?
01:59:32.135: >> Vice Chair Mills: I KNOW THAT OUR ORDINANCE IN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE -- WHERE THERE'S MITIGATION REQUIRED FOR LANDMARKED TREES, WE ASK -- IT'S NOT JUST LIKE THE PHYSICAL REMOVAL, BUT IT CAN ALSO BE, LIKE, DAMAGING THE ROOT ZONES. MY QUESTION IS, LIKE, WERE THESE TREES, LIKE COMPLETELY TAKEN DOWN OR WAS -- IS THIS MITIGATION REQUIRED BECAUSE YOU GOT TOO CLOSE TO THEIR ROOTS?
01:59:59.696: >> I WILL TELL YOU THAT THERE WAS PROBABLY BETWEEN THE TWO TREES, THE ONE WAS PROBABLY BECAUSE OF THE ROOT DAMAGE BECAUSE WE ARE THE FULL CITY BLOCK. AND THAT WAS THE ELM ON BROWN. THE OTHER ONE WAS ON THE CORNER OF DAVIS AND -- I'M LOOKING AT THE SITE MAP, DAVIS AND GREEN AND, REALLY, IT'S PROBABLY -- THEY ARE SAYING THE -- YOU KNOW TIFFANY IS SAYING THEY WERE BOTH DAMAGED BY CONSTRUCTION. WE WERE DOING INTENSE UNDERGROUND UTILITIES AND ROADWORK IN THAT AREA. IN IF A ACCOUNT, BETWEEN THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR AND US, WE WERE BUILDING A WATER MAIN IN GREENE STREET AND THAT TREE WAS THERE. THE ISSUE IS THAT THEY ARE SAYING THAT BOTH TREES WERE DAMAGED FROM CONSTRUCTION.
02:00:53.850: >> Vice Chair Mills: SO ARE THOSE TREES STILL STANDING OR DID YOU END UP TAKING THEM DOWN?
02:00:57.788: >> WE TOOK THEM DOWN, AND BETWEEN BRETT AND JEFF AND TIFFANY, THEY REQUIRED TO TAKE THEM DOWN, MORE FROM THE SAFETY STANDPOINT BECAUSE THEY WERE IN THE RIGHT-OF-WAY THAT THEY WERE REMOVED RIGHT AWAY.
02:01:14.137: >> Vice Chair Mills: GOT IT. OKAY. AND THEN THE SECOND QUESTION I HAD WAS, LIKE, HOW DO WE KNOW ABOUT THIS? LIKE, WHAT IS THE -- JUST FOR OUR -- YOU KNOW, FOR OUR OWN EDUCATION, LIKE, THE PROCESS WHERE YOU REALIZE, LIKE, OH, THERE ARE TWO TREES THAT ARE SHOWN ON SITE PLAN AS NOT BEING IMPACTED BUT THEY WERE. IT SOUNDS LIKE THAT'S A COMBINATION -- IT SOUNDED LIKE IT WAS PART OF A CITY STAFF INSPECTION THING; IS THAT RIGHT? I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S FOR JENNIFER OR FOR -- OR FOR JEFF.
02:01:47.804: >> I WILL ADD JUST QUICKLY AND THEN JEFF JUMP IN, OBVIOUSLY. WE -- YOU KNOW WHEN WE NOTICED THE TREES, WE HAD SENT AN EMAIL DIRECTLY TO TIFFANY TO MAKE SURE WE COULD COME OUT. AT THE SAME TIME, MARK HOWELL CAME OUT FOR THE BUILDING INSPECTION AND NOTICED THE TREES AND COMMENTED. IT WAS HAPPENING AT THE SAME TIME. OUR RECOMMENDATION OR HOPE WAS THAT -- BUT, YOU KNOW, THE CITY, BETWEEN THEIR ARBORIST AND TIFFANY, THEY DECIDED THE TREES WERE TOO FAR DAMAGED. WE WANTED TO HIRE  ANN ARBORIST AS WELL AND ASSESS THEM DO YOU IN THE SPRING, BUT THE DECISION WAS THAT THE TREES, IN THEIR OPINION WERE TOO FAR GONE TO BE MAINTAINED. I WILL ALSO -- YOU KNOW, IT'S ALL HINDSIGHT BUT WHEN YOU ARE BUILDING ON A CITY BLOCK, IT'S A LITTLE BIT TOUGH TO TRY TO SAVE TREES. YOU WILL NOTICE IN THE TAB ON THE FIRST -- FROM THE ORIGINAL SITE PLAN, PRIOR TO TIFFANY, THE OTHER PERSON THAT WAS THERE HAD RECOMMENDED WE HAD FIVE ADDITIONAL TREES BECAUSE SHE WAS WORRIED ABOUT THE TREES IN GENERAL. SO THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL FIVE TREES FROM THE ONLY A SITE PLAN APPROVAL THAT WE ADDED BECAUSE SHE ASKED US TO. SO IT -- IT IS TOUGH WHEN YOU ARE BUILDING ON A FULL SITE. OR A FULL BLOCK, I SHOULD SAY.
02:03:09.686: >> THE ONLY THING --
02:03:11.822: >> UNFORTUNATELY. SORRY, JEFF, GO AHEAD.
02:03:14.157: >> THE ONLY THING I WOULD ADD IS THAT BEST OF PLANS SOMETIMES GET INTERRUPTED BY CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY, RECOGNIZING THAT THERE ARE MULTIPLE CONTRACTORS OUT THERE DOING MULTIPLE THINGS, SOME OF WHOM ARE LESS FAMILIAR WITH THE NATURAL FEATURES PROTECTION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SITE PLAN. WHAT WE DO IS WE HAVE STAFF IN THE FIELD PRETTY REGULARLY, MONITORING SITUATIONS LIKE THIS IN HOPES TO PREVENT IT, BUT SOMETIMES WE'RE UNABLE TO. WE DO INCLUDE MITIGATION STANDARDS, WHICH ARE INTENTIONALLY EXPENSIVE AND PAINFUL. I THINK THESE TWO TREES MIGHT COST MORE THAN $30,000 TO REPLACE, MAYBE MORE. AND THAT'S WITH INTENT. WE WANT PEOPLE TO BE COGNIZANT OF THESE NATURAL FEATURES AND WE WANT TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PROTECT THEM, AND IF FOR SOME REASON THEY ARE DAMAGED, OR REMOVED, THEN WE DO HAVE A MECHANISM IN PLACE TO GET REPLACEMENT TREES.
02:04:30.867: >> Chair Milshteyn: MR. LENART?
02:04:31.535: >> Planning Manager:  YEAH, I WANT TO SORT OF FOLLOW UP ON THAT. I DON'T KNOW THE CIRCUMSTANCE, BUT I VAGUELY RECALL THAT THERE WERE A COUPLE OF SITES THAT WERE FLAGGED AS A ROUTINE COURSE OF CITY INSPECTIONS AROUND THIS TIME. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WAS SPECIFICALLY FROM OUR FORESTER OR THROUGH THE BUILDING DEPARTMENT -- OR OFTEN TIMES THROUGH OUR GRADING PERMIT IF WE SEE SOMETHING, A QUESTION, WE ENDEAVOR TO COMMUNICATE ACROSS THOSE FOLKS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE -- WE ARE IDENTIFYING WHAT WE CAN. TO JEFF'S POINT, THOUGH, YOU KNOW, THERE ARE TIMES WHERE IF WE IDENTIFY THAT SITE IT DOESN'T RESULT IN THIS. IN THIS CASE, OUR FORESTER DETERMINED THAT THESE TREES WERE COMPROMISED TO SUCH A POINT THAT WE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR PRESENCE IN THE RIGHT-OF-WAY, AND, YOU KNOW, THE APPLICANT, MS. ROTH IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. WE MADE THE DECISION THAT THEY NEEDED TO BE REMOVED. BUT IN OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES, WE HAVE FOUND, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT PROTECTION FENCING HAS NOT BEEN INSTALLED CORRECTLY. CERTAINLY WHEN WE CAN IDENTIFY THAT, WE WILL WORK WITH THE PETITIONER TO IDENTIFY THAT AS WELL, AND REMEDY THAT SITUATION HOPEFULLY BEFORE IT GETS TO THIS POINT BUT IN THE CASE WHERE THE ACTUAL RESOURCE IS LOST, THAT'S WHEN SOME OF THESE CONSEQUENCES BECOME MORE SUBSTANTIAL.
02:05:52.515: >> Vice Chair Mills: FOR WHAT -- FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH, I FEEL LIKE I HAVE BEEN ON COMMISSION A WHILE, AND I DON'T REMEMBER HAVING THIS KIND OF SITUATION COME BACK. SO I FEEL LIKE -- IF THERE'S ANYBODY OUT IN CTN WATCHING US, OUTSIDE OF MS. WEATHERBEE, I LEARNED SOMETHING NEW TONIGHT ABOUT HOW THE CODE WORKS WHICH IS THAT THE MITIGATION IS -- THAT THERE'S A BIGGER PENALTY IF YOU SAY ON THE SITE PLAN, YOU KNOW, THESE ARE THE TREES WE ARE GOING TO KEEP AND BECAUSE OF THE COURSE OF CONSTRUCTION THEY GET TAKEN DOWN, LIKE THIS IS A -- THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL PENALTY. GOOD JOB, WHOEVER THOUGHT OF DOING THAT BEFORE. LIKE, I'M -- BUT ALSO TO PAINT THE PICTURE THAT, LIKE, I THINK THE SYSTEMS WE HAVE IN PLACE MUST BE PRETTY GOOD TO HELP FOR THIS, BECAUSE THIS IS -- THIS IS A PRETTY RARE OCCURRENCE, ACTUALLY, THAT WE HAVE PEOPLE COME BACK AND HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE SITE PLANNING PROCESS AGAIN FOR THIS PARTICULAR INSTANCE. PHYSUNLESS THERE'S SOMETHING, ANOTHER ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS THAT THIS HAPPENS MORE OFTEN THAN WHAT WE SEE THE SITE PLANS FOR. I ASSUME THAT THAT'S NOT THE CASE. TIME SEEING THE SHAKING HEADS WHERE IT'S $30,000 FOR TWO TREES, I'M GUESSING THAT DOESN'T -- PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO AVOID THAT?
02:07:14.264: >> WE HAVE LEARNED USUALLY YOU MAKE THIS MISTAKE ONCE.
02:07:20.403: >> Vice Chair Mills: GOT. IT. THANK YOU.
02:07:25.341: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER ABRONS AND THEN COMMISSIONER BRIGGS.
02:07:31.448: >> Commissioner Abrons:  I HAVE ONLY BEEN ON THE COMMISSION A SHORT TIME BUT THIS IS FIRST TIME I HAVE SEEN A SITUATION LIKE. THIS AND I GUESS I WONDERED, LIKE, BECAUSE IT IS A PROJECT THAT'S ALREADY BEEN APPROVED AND UNDER CONSTRUCTION, IF WE DIDN'T APPROVE IT, WHAT WOULD BE THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT? LIKE, IS THERE ANY ALTERNATIVE PLAN? IN IN OTHER WORDS, I'M WONDERING WHY -- IT FEELS MORE ADMINISTRATIVE. IS THERE SOMETHING THAT I'M MISSING ABOUT, YOU KNOW, WHAT I SHOULD BE CONSIDERING WHEN I'M THINKING ABOUT THIS PETITION?
02:08:06.082: >> Planning Manager:  THE ORDINANCE IS SET UP IN A WAY -- SO ONCE A SITE PLAN IS APPROVED, WE HAVE INCORPORATED INTO THAT IS THE NATURAL FEATURES PROTECTION AND MITIGATION PLAN. AND THAT ORDINANCE IS INTENDED VERY SPECIFICALLY TO BE A VERY SPECIFIC ITEMIZED DETAILED COMPONENT OF THE SITE PLAN. SO THE CONSEQUENCE, IF THIS HAPPENED AND THIS STEP WAS NOT TAKEN, ULTIMATELY, JEFF WOULD GO OUT TO THE SITE, DO HIS FINAL INSPECTION ON THE EVE OF A CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY REQUEST AND WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO ISSUE A CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT COMPLIANT WITH THE NATURAL FEATURES, PROTECTION AND MITIGATION PLAN. THAT HAS A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT IMPACT TO THE PETITIONER, WHO ON THAT POINT IS HOPEFULLY OPEN THE CUSP OF PROBABLY TRANSITIONING FROM MONEY GOING OUT TO AT LEAST SOME SEMBLANCE OF MONEY COMING IN, AND I THINK THAT IT WAS ALSO, YOU KNOW TO THEIR CREDIT AS SOON AS THIS WAS IDENTIFIED, JUMPED ON IT RIGHT AWAY BECAUSE MAKING THESE DECISIONS NOW AS IT RELATES TO THEIR SITE GOING FORWARD, AS OPPOSED TO GETTING TO THAT FINAL STAGE TO IDENTIFY THIS PROBLEM, THAT WOULD BE MUCH MORE CHALLENGING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO THEN ADDRESS AND ACCOMMODATE THAT HIGHER LEVEL OF MITIGATION.
02:09:29.299: >> Commissioner Abrons:  BUT THE WAY IN WHICH THEY WERE MITIGATING THE LOSS OF THOSE TWO TREES, IS THERE -- IS THERE DISCRETION IN THAT MITIGATION OR IS IT PRETTY CLEAR ACCORDING TO THE ORDINANCE WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IN ORDER TO COMPENSATE FOR THAT LOSS?
02:09:44.447: >> Planning Manager:  THE ORDINANCE IS CLEAR IN THE AMOUNT THAT YOU HAVE TO MITIGATION, BUT THERE IS SOME FLEXIBILITY TO PROVIDE A CERTAIN AMOUNT ON SITE AND POTENTIALLY PROVIDE A FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTION TO THE CITY'S -- TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE CITY'S FORESTRY ASSETS ELSEWHERE, OR TO THE SITE. SO THERE IS SOME FLEXIBILITY, BUT IT'S NOT 100%. THE GOAL IS TO RETAIN AS MANY OF THE RESOURCES ON THE SAME SITE WHERE THEY WERE LOST AS POSSIBLE.
02:10:18.681: >> Commissioner Abrons:  SO MAYBE SOMEBODY COULD SPEAK TO THE DECISION THAT WAS MADE IN REGARDS TO THAT. LIKE, WHAT PERCENTAGE WAS MITIGATED ON SITE, VERSUS THE DONATION?
02:10:34.497: >> SO REQUIRED IS 126 INCHES. WE HAVE PROVIDED 99 INCHES. AND THEN THE REMAINDER -- BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO -- YOU HAVE TO EXCEED THE 50% AND THAT'S THE GOAL IS TRYING TO GET OVER THE 50%. SO THAT'S WHY WE SPENT SO MUCH TIME WITH TIFFANY TO MAKE SURE WE WERE LAYING THIS OUT STRATEGICALLY AND THEN THE REMAINDER 27 INCHES BECOMES -- THEN IN THE AGENDA, IT'S $5,400 THAT GOES TO A STORM STORMWATER. SO THAT'S HOW THEY -- THAT'S HOW THEY DO THE MATH ON THAT.
02:11:10.099: >> Commissioner Abrons:  OKAY. THANK YOU.
02:11:12.702: >> MM-HMM.
02:11:15.038: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER BRIGGS?
02:11:17.240: >> Commissioner Briggs: SO I GUESS PART OF MY QUESTION GOT ANSWERED THERE IN TERMS OF WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU CAN'T MITIGATE ENTIRELY ON SITE. AND THEN THE OTHER PART OF THAT IS -- IT SOUNDS LIKE MAYBE THE DUE DILIGENCE OBVIOUSLY WAS NOT TAKEN CARE OF ON THE SITE, BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE FROM JULIE'S CALL THAT MAYBE THE SAME -- THERE WASN'T ALSO THE AMOUNT OF CARE FOR THE ADJACENT NEIGHBORHOOD AS WELL. AND SO IS THERE ANY -- SHOULD NEIGHBORS BE INFORMING THE CITY IN ANY CERTAIN WAY AND IS THERE ANY RESOURCE FOR ANY STREET TREES POTENTIALLY IN THE RIGHT-OF-WAY THAT HAVE BEEN DAMAGE THROUGH THIS PROJECT, EITHER THIS PROJECT OR FUTURE PROJECTS BUT SPECIFICALLY FOR THIS ONE.
02:12:05.455: >> Planning Manager:  THAT IS SORT OF A NEW CONCERN THAT I HAVE NOT HEARD TO DATE, AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE BEST SORT OF REPORTING MECHANISM IS FOR THAT. BUT I KNOW THAT AS THE CITY, WE DO SPEND A FAIR AMOUNT OF TIME COORDINATING WITH PROJECT DEVELOPERS WITH SORT OF THEIR LOGISTICS, PLANNING FOR HOW THEY WILL ACCESS THE SITE, TRYING TO LIMIT SIDEWALK CLOSURES, FOR EXAMPLE TO THE GREATEST EXTENT POSSIBLE. I'M HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP WITH THE -- I WILL PROBABLY START WITH THE TEAM THAT SORT OF HELPS WITH SOME OF THOSE ASPECTS OF THE PROJECT AND JUST SEE WHAT MECHANISMS UNDER PLACE FOR THAT. -- ARE IN PLACE FOR THAT. OBVIOUSLY, YOU KNOW, WITH WE CARE DEEPLY ABOUT YOU ARE STREET TREES AND ALL OF OUR NATURAL RESOURCES. I WILL SEE WHAT THE PROPER CHANNELS ARE FOR THAT GOING IN THE FUTURE.
02:12:59.308: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL?
02:13:01.077: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: SO I HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE MITIGATION PLAN AND SOME OF THE SPECIES AND THE SIZE THAT IS LISTED ARE DIFFICULT TO PROCURE IN THE MARKETPLACE. YOU HAVE QUITE A FEW OF STORY UNDERTREE AND YOU LIST THEM AS Y KNOWLEDGE, IT'S PRETTY DIFFICULT TO BE ABLE TO TRACK THOSE DOWN IN THE REAL WORLD. YOU MAY BE ABLE TO COME UP WITH THEM, BUT I THINK IT'S UNLIKELY, ESPECIALLY GIVEN AFTER 2008, WITH THE RECESSION, A WHOLE LOT OF TREES WEREN'T PLANTED AND SO IT'S VERY DIFFICULT AT THIS POINT TO FIND -- AND TREES TAKE TIME TO GROW. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO -- TO FIND BIG CALIPER TREES RIGHT NOW. THEY HAVEN'T BEEN GROWING THEM LONG ENOUGH. SO WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW AND I'M WONDERING IF THERE'S SOME SORT OF SYNERGISTIC THING GOING ON WITH OUR FORMER PLANNING COMMISSIONER WEATHERBEE'S COMMENTS THAT IF YOU CAN'T FIND THESE, IF YOU CAN, FOR INSTANCE, ONLY FIND A 2-INCH RED BUD OR A IT INCH SERVICE BERRY AND YOU HAVE IT LISTED ON THE MITIGATION PLAN THAT SOME OF THOSE GAPS ACROSS THE STREET, SOME OF THE PLACES THAT ARE MORE GAFF TOOTH OR THINGS THAT WERE DAMAGED ACROSS THE STREET THAT PERHAPS THE  MAKEUP COULD BE ALONG THE CITY TREATS WHERE SOME OF THE CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT MAY HAVE DAMAGED OTHER TREES. SO, I MEAN, GOOD LUCK IF YOU CAN FIND IT, AWESOME. THAT'S GREAT. YOU HAVE GOT SOURCES THAT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT. BUT IF YOU CAN'T, THAT THERE'S SOME SORT OF MECHANISM IN PLACE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE UP THE DIFFERENCE AND IT COULD JUST BE MORE MONEY INTO THE STORMWATER FUND, BUT GIVEN THAT IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE WAS SOME DAMAGE TO SOME OF THE NEIGHBORING TREES ACROSS THE STREET, MAYBE THERE'S A WAY TO BE ABLE TO FILL IN SOME OF THE GAPS IN OTHER -- IN OTHER AREAS WHERE SOME OF THE CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT MAY HAVE HAD SOME IMPACT.
02:15:11.007: >> I WOULD JUST ADD THAT, YOU KNOW, THE THREE INCHES, I THINK YOU ARE RIGHT. WE ARE HEARING THAT, IF THIS GETS APPROVED, WE'VE GOT TO JUMP ON THIS RIGHT AWAY. IT WAS RECOMMENDED WE GO TO 3-INCH, JUST FOR THE DURABILITY, ESPECIALLY DURING FOOTBALL GAMES AND THE SIDEWALK AND THE RIGHT-OF-WAY, AND THE TREES IN THE RIGHT-OF-WAY. IT WAS RECOMMENDED THAT WE GO TO A 3-INCH CALIPER.
02:15:40.303: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: AGAIN, IF YOU CAN FIND THEM, I USUALLY NEVER SPEC OVER 2-INCH FOR THOSE PARTICULAR SPECIES BECAUSE THEY ARE HARD TO FIND -- AND BECAUSE THEY ARE SMALL INDUSTRIES. SO THEY JUST DON'T GET THAT HUGE. AND THAT WAY, IT'S A LOT EASIER -- I MEAN, YOU ARE PROBABLY GOING TO BE ABLE TO FIND YOUR TULIP TREE, AND MAYBE THIS ONE, BECAUSE IT'S A BIGGER TREE BUT THE RED BUD, THEY ARE JUST SMALLER TREES AND PEOPLE SELL THEM THAT WAY. SO, AGAIN, IF YOU FIND THEM, AWESOME. THAT'S GREAT, BUT IF YOU CAN'T, I JUST WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THAT THERE'S SOME SORT OF BACKUP PLAN AND PERHAPS THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO MAKE SOMETHING WORK WITH SOME OF THE OTHER TREES THAT WERE DAMAGED DURING THE CONSTRUCTION PROCESS AS A WAY TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE THAT.
02:16:30.519: >> Chair Milshteyn: MR. KAHAN.
02:16:31.153: >> I WAS JUST GOING TO RESPOND TO COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL THAT I WILL CERTAINLY TALK TO TIFFANY JAKOBOZI ABOUT THIS TOMORROW, ABOUT YOUR CONCERN, AND SEE WHAT KIND OF FLEXIBILITY SHE HAS WITH REGARD TO SIZES AND REMANHATTANNING ON ADJACENT RIGHT-OF-WAY, LAWN EXTENSIONS OR POSSIBLY SUPPLEMENT THE CONTRIBUTION TO THE CITY STORMWATER FUND. I WILL FOLLOW UP WITH THAT TOMORROW.
02:17:05.388: >> Planning Manager:  ONE OTHER ITEM ON THAT, IT'S STILL AN ADMINISTRATIVE PLAN ADJUSTMENT, BUT JUST CHANGING PLANT MATERIAL CAN BE APPROVED ADMINISTRATIVELY IF THERE'S A SPECIES -- IF THERE IS A NEED TO ADJUST SPECIES OR SOMETHING. AGAIN, IT'S AN MA ADMINISTRATIVE SITE PLAN, IT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WOULD COME TO PLANNING COMMISSION. IT WOULD JUST COME TO OUR DEPARTMENT AND WORKING WITH TIFFANY, BUT THAT'S ANOTHER RELIEF VALVE. IF THEY CAN'T FIND THAT, THEY CAN SAY, HEY, WE HAVEN'T FOUND THESE SPECIES AN WE WOULD PROPOSE SOMETHING DIFFERENT, AND WE WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO APPROVE THAT.
02:17:54.170: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: AND IT MAY BE THAT YOU CHOSE THE SMALLER SPECIES BECAUSE OF SIZE CONSTRAINTS OR OVERHEAD LINES TOO, SO THAT'S ALL PART OF HOW YOU WOULD MAKE THAT DECISION. I'M GLAD THAT THIS IS ALL HAPPENING AND THAT THE RECKONING IS HAPPENING BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S KIND OF PLANS IN PLACE FOR ALTERNATES IF THINGS DON'T WORK OUT IN TERMS OF THE MARKETPLACE.
02:18:26.435: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER WOODS?
02:18:30.806: >> Commissioner Woods: I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT IN TERMS OF THE POSSIBILITY OF OTHER STREET TREES BEING DAMAGED THAT AREA OR ANY OTHER AREA OF THE CITY, I WOULD PROBABLY FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE IF CITIZENS WOULD TAKE PICTURES AND CERTAINLY CALL THE CITY TO LET US KNOW WHEN THINGS LIKE THAT ARE HAPPENING, BECAUSE SINCE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT POSSIBLY FOR MITIGATION, I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE AT THE TO DOCUMENT, YOU KNOW WHICH TRUCKS DID IT. AND IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S MORE THAN JUST THE DEVELOPMENT WORK GOING ON OVER THERE IN THAT AREA. I THINK IT'S ALWAYS PROBABLY GOOD TO SORT OF DOCUMENT, YOU KNOW, WHERE THE DAMAGE IS OCCURRING AND WHO DID IT.
02:19:25.127: >> Chair Milshteyn: FURTHER DISCUSSION. IT LOOKS LIKE WE ARE READY FOR A VOTE. MR. LENART, IF YOU CAN DO THE ROLL CALL, PLEASE.
02:19:46.081: >> Commissioner Briggs: YES.
02:19:48.517: >> Vice Chair Mills: YES.
02:19:49.452: >> Chair Milshteyn: YES.
02:19:50.920: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: YES.

02:21:04.059: >> CALLER 339, WOULD YOU LIKE TO SPEAK TO THE COMMISSION? (MUSIC).
02:21:21.610: >> I DON'T SEE ANOTHER HAND RAISED.
02:21:23.879: >> Chair Milshteyn: ALL RIGHT. SEEING NO OTHER HAND, WE WILL JUST GIVE IT ONE QUICK SECOND. ALL RIGHT. WE WILL MOVE ON TO COMMISSION PROPOSED BUSINESS. ARE THERE ANY -- IS THERE ANY COMMISSION PROPOSED BUSINESS AT THIS TIME? COMMISSIONER BRIGGS FOLLOWED BY ACKERMAN.
02:21:48.070: >> Commissioner Briggs: I DIDN'T HAVE COMMISSION PROPOSED BUSINESS, BUT I WAS WONDERING WHERE WE WERE IN TERMS OF THE MASTER PLAN CONSULTANT SELECTION PROCESS. I KNOW THIS WAS A SURVEY THAT WAS BEING CONSIDERED. BUT --
02:22:06.789: >> Planning Manager:  THE PROPOSED CONSULTANT. IT'S THE TIME STATUS AS LAST UPDATE. THE PROPOSED CONSULTANT AND CONTRACT WAS PRESENTED TO CITY COUNCIL LAST LAST YEAR. THEY HAD SOME ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS SUGGESTED POSSIBLY A WORKING SESSION PARTICULARLY WITH SOME OF THE RESIDENT VOLUNTEERS THAT PARTICIPATED WITH THE CITY IN SELECTING AND RECOMMENDING THAT CONSULTANT. SOME OF THOSE CITIZEN REPRESENTATIVES HAVE EXPRESSED THAT THEY ARE NOT PARTICIPATING IN THAT ANY FURTHER. SO WE HAVE SHARED THAT INFORMATION. I THINK THAT WE HAVE THAT THEY RAISED A LOT OF GREAT COMMENTS THAT WERE, I THINK EITHER MORE -- IN A MORE REFINED WAY ANOTHADDED IN THE PROPOSED SCOOT WERE ADDED. SOME ADDITIONAL QUESTIONED DO REMAIN. I HAVE FORWARDED THE SORT OF -- A COUPLE OF OPTIONS TO THE COMMUNITY SERVICES ADMINISTRATOR AND THE R INTERIM CITY ADMINISTRATOR. I WOULD HAVE TO PRESUME GIVEN EVERYTHING ELSE THAT IS GOING ON, IT HAS NOT ELEVATED TO MAKING THE DETERMINATION ABOUT WHAT THE NEXT STEPS ARE WITH THAT, BUT WITH ANY LUCK THAT QUESTION WILL BE ANSWERED IN THE COMING MONTHS.
02:23:34.610: >> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR.
02:23:38.147: >> Councilmember Ackerman: TWO COMMENTS, ONE THAT I FAILED TO UPDATE ON THE COUNCIL UPDATE, THAT OUR LAST PLANNING COMMISSION MEETING HAD BEEN CANCELED, BUT I WANTED TO GIVE YOU AN UPDATE ON TRANSIT-SUPPORTED DEVELOPMENT. IT HAD BEEN MY INTENTION TO BRING FORWARD A RESOLUTION TO CITY COUNCIL GIVING US SOME CLEAR DIRECTION AND DEMONSTRATING BUY-IN FROM CITY COUNCIL ON THE TOPIC OF THE T1 THAT WE HAD BEEN DISCUSSING AND WAS THE SUBJECT OF A PUBLIC HEARING OF OURS IN THE FALL. COUNCIL WITH VERY LIMITED DEBATE VOTED TO TABLE IT UNTIL THE STATE AT HOME ORDER WAS LIFTED, BUT IT'S UNCLEAR WHAT THE NEXT STEPS MAY LOOK LIKE. SO I WOULD LEAVE IT TO KIND OF THE BODY MAYBE THE CHAIR OR VICE CHAIR IF THEY WANT TO KEEP TAKING THAT ON. WE DON'T HAVE A CLEAR DIRECTION IT'S IN LIMBO AND IT'S STILL IN OUR WORK PLAN AND I WOULD LEAVE IT TO THE BODY TO DECIDE IF YOU WANT TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON IT. I DON'T THINK THAT THERE ARE ANY PARLIAMENT ISSUES WITH THAT, BUT TOTALLY UP TO THE BODY TO MAKE THAT DECISION. AND I'M HAPPY TO TALK OFFLINE AS WELL. THE OTHER ONE WAS WITH RESPECT TO ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS. MR. LENART BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION THAT WHEN WE UPDATED THE UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE, THERE WAS A SCRIVENERS ERROR THAT OMITTED A ZONING DISTRICT FOR ADUs TO BE PERMITTED WITH IT, MEANING THERE'S A ZONING DISTRICT LEFT OFF THE MAPS, AND SO UNFORTUNATELY, IT WASN'T CAUGHT IN TIME -- OR ACTUALLY DO YOU WANT TO WALK THROUGH THE PROCESS AND EXPLAIN WHAT WE MIGHT ATTEMPT TO RECTIFY THAT?
02:25:43.272: >> Planning Manager:  YEAH, SURE. WHEN THE ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT THAT ON WAS ORIGINALLY AMENDED IN 2016, IT WAS PUT IN PLACE AT THAT TIME, AT THE TIME OF ADOPTION IN ALL THE R1 DISTRICTS AND ALSO IN THE R2A DISTRICT. THE INTENSION AT THE R2A INCLUDES, AND I THINK GENERALLY WAS THAT WE DO HAVE SOME LOTS IN THE CITY THAT DON'T MEET THE MINIMUM LOT SIDE TO ACTUALLY FULLY ALLOW A DUPLEX. THIS WOULD BE AB OPPORTUNITY FOR THOSE TO PROVIDE AN ADU IF YOU WERE A SINGLE FAMILY PROPERTY STILL MEETING ALL THE OTHER REQUIREMENTS OF ADU. THAT WAS ENACTED WHEN THE UDC WAS ADOPTED THAT THE R2A DISTRICT WAS LEFT OFF INADVERTENTLY. AFTER THAT ADOPTION OF THE UDC, WE LOOKED AT A WIDE VARIETY TO MODIFY THE ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT TO CONSIDER MORE REALIZATION OF IT. SO YOU AS THE COMMISSION WORKED ON A SERIES OF AMENDMENTS. AT THAT TIME, THAT ZONING DISTRICT WAS INCLUDED IN A WIDER RECOMMENDATION OF EXPANDING IT TO OTHER ZONING DISTRICTS AS WELL. THE CITY COUNCIL ULTIMATELY REJECTED THOSE PROPOSED AMENDMENTED AND SO MY POSITION ON THIS IS THAT WHILE PERHAPS LOST IN SOME OF THE CROSS FIRE OF SOME OF THAT BACK AND FORTH OF AMENDMENTS, THE COUNCIL HAS NOW TAKEN A VERY SPECIFIC ACTION NOT TO EXPAND THE ZONING DISTRICTS IN WHICH ACCESSORY DWELLINGS ARE APPROVED AND IT LOSES A BIT OF THAT SCRIVENER'S ERROR, IN MY LENS AS COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN HAS INDICATED. IS THAT BACKGROUND HELPFUL AT ALL?
02:27:46.328: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES. AND WHAT I WOULD HOPE THE BODY WOULD CONSIDER, WAS CUING UP A SIMPLE ORDINANCE AMENDMENT, IT WOULD GO THROUGH OUR NORMAL PROCESS BUT HOPEFULLY PRETTY STRAIGHT FORWARD IN SERVING SOME Ps INTO OUR UDC TABLE AND MOVING ON WITH OUR LOTS. AND I WANTED TO INSERT THAT AS WELL.
02:28:19.227: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER BRIGGS.
02:28:20.429: >> Commissioner Briggs: JUST TO ADD TO THAT. COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN, YOU PROBABLY -- YOU CAN DEFINITELY SPEAK TO THIS BETTER, BUT IT SEEMS TO ME, WHAT I REMEMBER FROM THAT COUNCIL DISCUSSION WAS NOT AP AN OUTRIGHT REJECTIONS OF THE AD Us BUT RATHER A SUGGESTION THAT MORE COMMUNITY INPUT WAS REQUIRED BEFORE WE COULD MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT, THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS, AND SO I WONDER IF THERE'S BEEN ANY CONSIDERATION PUT INTO PLACE TO GATHERING MORE COMMUNITY INPUT ON THIS MATTER, AT LEAST, YOU KNOW, IF NOT SEPARATELY, AT LEAST EXPLICITLY WHEN WE GET STARTED ON THE MASTER PLAN UPDATE SO THAT THAT -- PERHAPS THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS COULD GO FORWARD AT SOME POINT WHEN -- WHEN AND IF THAT COMMUNITY INPUT IS RECEIVED.
02:29:08.677: >> Councilmember Ackerman: ABSOLUTELY. I THINK THAT'S A GREAT IDEA. OBVIOUSLY THE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT COMES WITH COSTS ASSOCIATED AND STAFF TIME AND TO THE DEGREE THAT I THINK SOME COLLEAGUES WOULD BE SATISFIED THAT CAN BE, YOU KNOW, A FIVE FIGURE SUM. IT DOESN'T GET THROWN AROUND LIGHTLY. I LIKE YOUR IDEA OF THROWING THEM INTO THE MASTER PLAN BUDGET. THE TIMING OF THAT, I CAN'T PROMISE YOU ON ONE COUNCIL, IN NOVEMBER, BUT PERHAPS SOMEONE ELSE AT THIS TABLE WILL CHAMPION THAT.
02:29:46.348: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER MILLS.
02:29:52.087: >> Vice Chair Mills: SO ON THE -- ON THE ADU, LIKE, SCRIVENER'S ERROR, THIS -- I CAN'T REMEMBER IF WE CALLED IT LIKE ZORRO 2.0 OR UDC, I CAN'T REMEMBER EXACTLY WHAT NUMBER WE GAVE IT, FOR PEOPLE WOULD WEREN'T ON COUNCIL -- OR ON PLANNING COMMISSION THEN. THE PROCESS THAT WE WENT THROUGH TO GET US THE UDC WAS CALLED ZORRO. THE ZONING ORDINANCE REORGANIZATION. AND WE KNEW THAT THERE WOULD BE THINGS THAT FELL THROUGH THE CRACKS, LIKE, THAT WERE JUST NOT TRANSLATED APPROPRIATELY. AND WE WENT THROUGH ONE BATCH OF THOSE ALREADY. DO YOU KNOW, BRETT, IF THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE BESIDES THIS? OR HAVE WE -- DO WE THINK WE HAVE TAKEN CARE OF ALL THE OTHER KIND OF TRANSLATION ERRORS OR OMISSIONS OF -- THAT WE'RE WERE INADVERTENT. SO JUST FOR EVERYBODY'S LIKE, SAKE, WHO WASN'T -- THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS LIKE, STARTED WELL BEFORE I GOT ON PLANNING COMMISSION FIVE YEARS AGO AND TOOK A WHILE. THE HOPE WAS DOING ZORO TO GET US A UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT GOAT THAT WAS EASIER TO READ. WE KNEW THERE WOULD BE SOME TRANSLATION ERRORS AND THEN IT WOULD BE EASIER TO AMENDMENT TO SEE WHERE WE WANT TO MAKE SUBSTANTIVE CHANGES, BUT SUBSTANTIVE CHANGES. WE HAVE TRANSLATED IT AND THE TRANSLATION WAS NOT PERFECT. IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE THAT WAS MISSED IN THAT TRANSLATION?
02:31:27.883: >> Planning Manager: PROBABLY. I DON'T KNOW OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD. I WOULD WANT TO GO BACK TO MY TEAM AND THE CITY PLANNER DELEO, WHO I SORT OF TASKED WITH BEING A BIT OF THE MANAGER EVER ALL OF THOSE AMENDMENTS SO WE CAN MAKE SURE WE ARE KEEPING TRACK OF THEM, WE HAVE MADE A LOT OF THOSE SORT OF 2.0 CORRECTIONS. WE HAVE DONE A FAIR AMOUNT OF AMENDING TO THE UDC SINCE IS IT WAS ADOPTED AND I DON'T KNOW THAT WE HAVE BEEN NECESSARILY ALWAYS WAITING TO PACKAGE THOSE SORT OF, YOU KNOW, SCRIVENER KIND OF CHANGES. SOMETIMES THEY HAVE BEEN PACKAGED WITH OTHER CHANGES TO SIMILAR SECTIONS FOR EXAMPLE. I'M JUST -- SOME OF THE EXAMPLES THAT WE HAVE ADDRESSED SINCE THAT TIME, FOR EXAMPLE YOU RECALL WE MADE A CLARIFICATION TO PARKS DONATION THAT IF YOU KNOW DATE A PARK LAND AS PART OF A DEVELOPMENT, YOU CAN CALCULATE THAT ANY SORT OF DENSITY CALCULATIONS. I THINK WE HAD AN AREA HEIGHT AND PLACE TO ONE OF YOU ARE MIXED USE TABLES. WE HAD A SERIES OF THOSE CORRECTIONS. I THINK IF WE ARE GOING TO DO THAT, LET'S MAYBE PACKAGE TOGETHER EVERYTHING WE HAVE ON OUR LIST IN THAT REGARD. IF THERE WERE OTHER THINGS PRESENT FROM THE FIRST UDC ADOPTION, WE COULD LINK THOSE.
02:33:08.116: >> Vice Chair Mills: THE INTENTION OF ZORO WAS NOT TO CHANGE. THERE WERE PAGES AND PAGES OF THINGS WHERE WE HAVE TO SAY, HMM, THIS LOOKS REALLY FUNKY. SHOULD WE TRANSLATE INTO THE NEW VERSION AND WE WERE PRETTY BRUTAL, LIKE VERY DILIGENT IN SAYING NO, THIS IS NOT -- IT'S NOT ABOUT CHANGING THE ORDINATE, BUT MAKING -- ORDINANCE, BUT MAKING IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND AND READ. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T KEEP THOSE THINGS TOO LONG. I THINK IT MAKES TONS OF SENSE, COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN TO BRING THAT UP AGAIN TO JUST BE CLEAR THAT THIS WAS -- THIS WAS NOT INTENTIONAL. AND -- AND -- AND SO WHETHER IT'S PACKAGED TOGETHER OR JUST AN OPPORTUNITY TO AGAIN SAY, LIKE, LET'S MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE TRUE TO WHAT THE GOALS OF ZORO WERE ALL ABOUT AND I THINK THAT THAT THEN HELPS US DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN, LIKE, THIS JUST TRANSCRIPTION VERSUS POLICY CHANGE, RIGHT? LIKE ORDINANCE CHANGING. AND RECOGNIZING JUST LIKE PEOPLE IN THIS BODY, WE DON'T ALL HAVE THAT HISTORY, COUNCIL DOESN'T ALL HAVE THAT HISTORY EITHER. AND I THINK THAT THAT'S ALSO HELPFUL FOR, LIKE -- SO THAT THERE IS JUST SOME COLLECTIVE KNOWLEDGE, LIKE IT HELPS POTENTIALLY DEMONSTRATE KIND OF WHAT THAT WAS ALL ABOUT AND AN X BEING LEFT OFF THE TABLE, WHILE IT'S UNFORTUNATE WAS LIKE -- IT WAS CRAZY! YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THE NUMBER OF FOOTNOTES INVOLVED IN THAT TRANSLATION. IT WAS QUITE AN UNDERTAKING.
02:35:02.364: >> Planning Manager: OBVIOUSLY COMMISSIONER MILLS IS STILL SCARRED.
02:35:05.667: >> Vice Chair Mills: I'M SLIGHTLY SCARRED. I HAVE A COUPLE OF THE DRAFTS. IT WAS IMPRESSIVE. LIKE, A ALEXIS IS DEFINITELY A HERO UP THERE.
02:35:19.247: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES, I THINK THE MEMO WILL NEED TO BE LASER FOCUSED AND CRYSTAL CLEAR. VERY CLEAR. NOT A POLICY CHANGE. AND  FIXING AN HONEST TO MAKE.
02:35:42.670: >> Chair Milshteyn: ALL RIGHT. I'M IN FAVOR OF PUSHING T1. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT AND I THINK WHETHER IT'S NOW OR LATER, I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD CONTINUE WORKING ON SINCE WE HAVE ALREADY SPENT AS FAR AS I CAN REMEMBER WE SPENT TWO WORKING SESSIONS ON IT. I THINK WE HAVE
