00:01:29.053: >> I can.  Okay.  (Roll call)
00:01:58.916: >> Lee?
00:02:00.117: >> Here.
00:02:00.651: >> And Clark, not here yet.  So we'll keep an eye on her. Okay, we got a quorum.
00:02:06.324: >> Very good, item number three is introductions.  There are none this evening, are there?
00:02:12.463: >> There are none.
00:02:13.397: >> Okay.  Great.  Item four is approval of the agenda.  May I have a motion to approve the agenda, moved by commissioner Milshteyn.  Any discussion of the agenda.  All in favor say yes or raise a hand.  That is Commissioner Lee.  That is all of us present.  Commissioner Clark is here if you can promote her.
00:02:44.662: >> Will do.
00:02:48.466: >> And we will move onto item five.  The minutes of the previous might.  May I have a motion to approve the minutes of the January 21, 2021 meeting.  Are there any discussion of the minutes?  Is there any discussion?  Proper English.  All right.  All in favor of the motion, please say yes or raise your hand.  Yes? That is everybody here. Commissioner Clark?
00:03:17.928: >> Yes, sorry, technical difficulties.
00:03:20.598: >> No problem.  Welcome.  This is why we are patient in this online. . .  All right that is everyone then.  Item number six is reports from city administration, city council, planning manager, planning commission officers and committees and written communications.  Councilmember Disch, do you have any report from last night.
00:03:45.723: >> Yes, I do.  We did the final passage on the Lockwood project on the site plan and the rezoning and final passage of 2111 Packard which I enthusiastically championed as an all electric development because Ken Garber had called up and done the same thing but it turns out that's not necessarily the case.  It's likely but not in the development agreement I'm sorry for jumping the gun and getting all excited but maybe I'll have to send the developer a bottle of champagne and make my dream a reality.  We did not discuss the 1290 road annexation that you had discussed.  I don't know why that was taken off the council agenda but it's one of those, you know, since we are talking, you know, about the concerns that we have learned about, about the kinds of costs that we impose on folks, this was kind of a textbook case of that.  And I was going to speak to, you know, maybe the 12 inch water main, okay.  Or the fire hydrant but both?  Really?  But I didn't get a chance to do that.  So if anybody wants to reach out to me and give me a little bit more ammunition or suggestions or brief me in any way I am happy to go out with guns firing in the spirit I heard you all discuss and I think that's all that happened that's of major interest to you.  But I'm happy to be amended and corrected.
00:05:42.907: >> Very good.  Thank you for that report and any of us will be happy to fill you in.  And just for your organization, right, this is the other thing that will soon the idea of these development costs is in the memo that if it hasn't already been translated to your body was, you know, we voted to translate those soon. Mr. Kowalski, anything to add?
00:06:08.599: >> Yeah, I do have one item from the February 9th.  We have our working session on February 9th which will be continued did I concussion.  -- discussion on the creation of the transit supporting district as well as the dwelling ordinance So revisions on that that will be on your February 9th working session meeting and that's it for me.
00:06:33.691: >> Any other commissioner officers or committee lay liaisons who have anything to report. I'll report that ORC did meet last week and we talked -- gave some feedback to staff about things that might be helpful to bring to that working session regarding the transit district. I just want to underscore, first of all I think it's going to be a little bit different than normal working sessions in that there will be a webinar version, a Zoom so people can see what we're talking about and we've talked about potentially allowing for a little more interaction.  I don't know exactly what that's going to look like but for people who are listening, we really want feedback so please come out and tell us.  You know, that came out in a press release today.  But among the things are requiring or not every property have mixed use on it.  Height.  The setbacks, how close things e to the sidewalk or to other property lines so parking, like, whether we set a maximum.  Whether any parking is required at all and so all of these things are things that we want to -- we need to discuss in order to give a recommendation back to council so, please, come tell your friends.  Come and participate.  The other thing just as a report that we talked about in ORC is working through that site plan's threshold memo that we provided back to city council so thiss to what commissioner Ditschas just talking about. City couil had asked us fore to look at what the thresholds are f sma ojects. Anso w effectively said here's what we hea was broken d these are tngs we think we shod workn and ORC gave recommentions and direion of kind of wt t bri back next.  So that wcan actuall get working on that.  Athing else? here are som written communationsn ourackets so we'll mov onto item number seven ich is audnce rtipatn.This i an portity f personso spk for up to thr minutes on an issue that is not on the public agenda.  If you called to talk about 201 Church Road. To comment on any other matters please call and enter the ID. City staff will select callers that have raised their hand. Calling on you by the last three digits of your telephone number in order to electronically raise your hand to indicate your desire to speak press star nine on your phone.  You will hear an automated message saying that the host is allowing you to speak.  Once speaking, please move to a quiet area and remove background noise so we can hear you clearly.  Please state your name and address.  Looks like we have a caller on the line who has raised their hand.
00:09:53.524: >> We do.  Should be good. Caller with the last three digits 534.
00:10:04.234: >> This is Tom Stulberg.  I've talked before about my background, my experience and that I used to develop subdivisions that we didn't build the houses.  We specialized in doing rezonings and getting approvals from township boards and councils and my father did that for his entire career.  So I was a second generation developer. But I also have experience for other twenty years as a coach and a referee.  So I think it really fits my personality that I like the laws and the rules and the process.  And that's how I learnt zoning and planning.  Zoning is law.  And there is a process.  And I do get frustrated sometimes when we don't follow the process. We do some inappropriate things.  It's tough getting frustrated at you or councilmembers because you all have not been trained in a lot of the parts of the job that your asked to do.  There's some parts of it that you do a very good job at.  I've been watching planning commission for quite some time now but there's certain things like rezonings and when you need a master plan revision prior to entertaining a rezoning that you simply haven't been trained on.  And I know some top experts in the field and I had them watch some clips and I guess my favorite comment from one of the experts is they're not even having the right conversation.  There's criteria in our ordinance that need to be followed.  We have the Michigan zoning enabling act that allows us to have a zoning ordinance if they do us the way they want us to do it and we don't always do that.  So we put ourselves in some legal jeopardy by doing that and we put ourselves in the potential for some very negative outcomes.  One thing I want to object to is the memo from C1A and C1AR.  That's not how it happened.  You all voted on December 15th on a specific memo and you all said that it was very important that you respond to council before the end of the year as you were charged to do and you did that and you made a couple small changes.  Significant but small changes to the memo and that should have gone to council and it didn't go to council. Council had a meeting on the 21st.  That was within the time where the moratorium was still active and the moratorium could have been extended for another 180 days.  The memo did not go to council as you voted.
00:12:48.398: >> 30 seconds.
00:12:49.032: >> So councils will and planning commissions will -- were not achieved so I'm not blaming you guys.  You gave clear direction but it didn't happen.  I also want to talk about real briefly some of the things that are coming up. I'll be here next week and talk to you about the other things then.  So have a good evening, thank you.
00:13:13.323: >> Thank you.
00:13:15.792: >> Thank you.  I see no other callers on the line.
00:13:19.329: >> All right so, we will move onto item number eight which are the public hearings for the next meeting.
00:13:27.104: >> Yes.  We have three scheduled public hearings for the next meeting.  The site plan and special exception for special approval.  This is a proposed site plan to redevelop the existing one building into a marijuana provisioning center.  As well as a marijuana retailer including rearranging and improving the parking lot as well as providing complete land use buffers as well as having resource for solid waste recycling and there's the special exception use again to allow the marijuana provisioning center and retailer at that location.  And another one for 2394 Winewood. This is also -- this was a business that was originally approved in 2018.  Again, for a medical marijuana provisioning center.  The site permits were constructed according to the approved site plan and the petitioner is requesting the special use for the marijuana micro business which allows cultivation as well as the sales of marijuana.  No other changes are proposed to the site.  So that is not a site plan, just a special exception use.  Those are the two scheduled public hearings for the next meeting.
00:14:45.949: >> Very good.  Thank you, we are onto item 9-A in our regular business this is the 201 skyScio.  We will allow th petition ter to allow a presentation for up to ten minutes.  We will open the public hearing and then have our discussion.
00:15:27.657: >> I have a brief presentation dealing with the nature of the proposal.  I said the petitioner did not have to prepare a presentation since there wasn't much to present. He's on the phone right now. You should be unmuted if you would like to say anything, introduce yourself.
00:15:44.141: >> My name's Aziz and one of the owners of the lot and we're proposing to annex it from Ann Arbor to Pittsfield.
00:15:55.519: >> That is well within your ten minutes of presentation.
00:15:57.787: >> Thank you, short and to the point.  We will -- I will keep you on the line and just, if you want to mute yourself, if we have any additional questions we may call you back up.
00:16:07.564: >> Perfect.  Well, perfect. Yeah.
00:16:11.635: >> Okay.  Thank you.  Okay, I think at this time we'll go right into my presentation.  I should be able to share my screen here in a -- there we go.  Does everybody see my screen okay?
00:16:33.089: >> Yes, and it's full screen too.
00:16:35.392: >> I'll ask if it's not advancing because I've had that issue in the past.  Again, everybody knows the address. This is an annexation and a zoning, they are requesting an R2A zoning.  You can see here on the left is a zoning map. Obviously in the township the gray is surrounding township lands.  Most of the township lands to the west are currently vacant.  So, again, outlined in yellow across from pioneer high school just adjacent from Ann Arbor Celine Road.  One thing I will mention is as it relate to the master plan, the master plan recommendation, it really uncovered this whole general area here including all the gray parcels and one of the developed parcels here as well as the interception around Scio Church and Scio Main and this is along the intersection.  And then we have the transition from single family attached to the single family detached which is here along the west. This map's a pretty good indication of you do see there is some adjacent art.  Not quite adjacent but the development of duplexes as well as some similar on the land adjacent to that.  I wanted to point that out in light of the master plan recommendation. Here is the subject site as you can see from the road.  It's vacant.  And here's the required altered survey, I believe it's 1.4 acres.  1.24 acres.  Again, really at this time the petitioner is planning to annex it and requesting an R2.  With that we have -- the planning manager has recommended an area plan waiver which is something you can see that that is a separate motion planned by a planning commission.  We can requesting thatware at this time because according to the code there is no new development plan at this time and they have provided the required land survey. In the future, obviously, the intent would be to develop some kind of duplexes on the par krill and -- parcel. As an annexation and rezoning, if this is approved tonight it would go to council for the next step for the annexation and if the annexation is approved by city council that will go to the state of Michigan and then come back to city council for the readings of the R2 zoning.  That does conclude my presentation at this time.  Thank you.
00:19:26.763: >> Thank you very much.  I will now open the public hearing for this item.  This is an opportunity for persons to speak for up to three minutes about the proposed 301 Scio Church Road.  Enter ID 99171640409.  City staff will connect callers who have raised their hand calling on you one by one using the last three digits of your telephone number.  In order to electronically raise your hand you'll press star nine on your telephone.  You'll hear an announcement that you may speak.  Please also state your name and address at the beginning of your comments.
00:20:21.785: >> Okay, I see we have one caller on the line.  Ok, so caller with theast three digits 185 iyou can unmute
00:20:32.295: >> Hellone,ou can sak now.
00:20:40.069: >> Hello, we can he you.
00:20:42.172: >> s, my name'sAan.  I own rental prer.  Firstf al It's the- as I understd  the neighbors and lands down were not directly notified about this meeting.  Which I think they should have been.  I'm -- I object to any development that's going to have linkages to lands down.  I think it's going to be detrimental to the lands down subdivision.  It's going to provide -- it's going to increase traffic in the neighborhood.  And put an additional load on the sewer system which is already at capacity.  I just think that any connections to lands down are going to be detrimental to the lands down subdivision. That pretty much sums up my comment.
00:22:01.851: >> Thank you very much.
00:22:05.021: >> Thank you.  Seeing no one else on the line, I will go ahead and close the public hearing and read the motions. The Ann Arbor city planning commission hereby recommends that the council approve the annexation in R2A single family district zoning and waives the area plan requirement because the zoning is consistent with the master plan, no new construction is proposed and a survey of the existing improvements on the site has been provided.  Can I have a commissioner move these?  Moved by commission er Suave.  Any objections to take them together?  We will discuss them together as well?  Any questions?  Comments for staff?
00:23:07.617: >> Commissioner Lee.
00:23:08.885: >> About the public comment about the insufficiency of notice, can you just clarify whether sufficient notice was given to the nearby neighborhoods.
00:23:20.163: >> Sure, I just -- looked quickly when -- once we were -- during that comment.  We did sent out all the required mailing labels but it looks like from, again, I didn't have a lot of time but some of those -- a lot of them is outside the area that this would reach, outside the boundary of the buffer of what would be noticed unfortunately so when a site plan comes back in, we will make sure and double check that but at this time it looks they were beyond the notice.  We have the list of what was mailed out.  I can't verify, again, the postal service necessarily delivered them but it looks like the notice was prepared.
00:23:56.766: >> It's safe to say that procedurally everything was done correctly.
00:23:59.902: >> I believe so, yes, from my verification at this time, yes.
00:24:06.709: >> Okay.  Thank you.  My other question is whether there are plans to connect this with the land back drive.  I see there's a lot of other parcels but any indications that's the case?  I don't see how it's physically really possible but --
00:24:25.528: >> No, again, at this time, the property owner doesn't have any specific plans for development, but looking at the way the site lays out, looking at the configuration of the site, I think that would be, you'd have to acquire additional parcels in between there.  There's also wetland I know from my work on the adjacent -- well not adjacent, it kind of touches around the back there on Celine Road.  We'd have to look at that as a site plan but again, at this point there's no plans for that and I think it would be infinitely complicated.
00:25:02.965: >> GOIT.  Thank you.  Those are the two questions I had at this time.
00:25:07.203: >> Commissioner Ditsch.
00:25:08.104: >> I wanted to follow up on Mr. Lee's first question. And I think this is going to become increasingly an issue as we move into transit supportive projects.  Because they're in areas where the radius of notification isn't going to buy you much in terms of neighboring neighbors I should say.  And so I am not necessarily advocating one way or the other but I'm merely asking if in order to avoid this -- these situations where people feel as if they haven't heard about something that they should have heard about, I'm wondering if we don't need to extend the radius of notification when we're working in areas where there's a mix of commercial and residential.
00:25:58.087: >> Yes.  I mean, that's certainly a possibility I mean we've done that for other ordinance amendments.  I know, things that probably involve a much larger area is what you're speaking people outside the area are affected by it.  We have it set for certain projects automatically but there's no reason why on larger projects that concern more of the citizens that involve and really affect more citizens that that notice area couldn't be increased.  What that distance is, I'm not sure we'd have to look at but that's a great point.
00:26:35.658: >> It also -- yes, I think the size of the project is definitely a factor, and it's also as we're in, it's one thing to have a tighter radius when we're in a densely populated residential area but as we move into these areas that are less densely populated that we want to make more dense I think people do end up feeling shortchanged and we're not note -- we're not providing notice in sheer numbers as many people because of the nature of that kind of neighborhood. So --
00:27:13.529: >> Yes, that's correct. There's several large parcels around this as you can see. You're correct that is a lot of that notification area.  That's something we can take under advisement and I will make note for future --
00:27:33.816: >> Commissioner Lee.
00:27:35.284: >> This question is for the petitioner.  Is that appropriate still learning.
00:27:44.327: >> Obviously the annexation process is a fairly lengthy, you have to go get an -- what are you guys thinking I'd love some context.  I've ready some of the things on Nextdoor and things of that nature.  I read my bike through here all the time I love the new bike lanes here but I would love to hear what prompted this?
00:28:14.023: >> Sorry, can I hear your quick question again, that toward me.
00:28:17.393: >> Could you just provide some context as to what you're thinking?  Because the annexation process is fairly involved so I would love to hear kind of what you're thinking.
00:28:26.736: >> We're definitely thinking more of as Matt said potentially a duplex.  For more loving there.  We know from my research, there's definitely not as much apartments or condos available there.  So we've had this land for quite some time at this point.  It has been part of Pittsfield and we want to move it to Ann Arbor because that's what fits the master plan.  The master plan for Pittsfield was just a single family home.  So for us, we're just thinking more housing, either for family housing or for more -- would say graduate.  Not as much as undergrad.  It's kind of a little further away from campus.  So definitely, we're aiming toward having condos there what fits under the master plan to do more as I said for families or to do for grad students.  We're thinking two or three bedrooms with, you know, garages but we're not that in depth just yet but that's the plan hopefully.
00:29:39.275: >> Thank you.  That's really all I had.  Just needed to get a little context.
00:29:45.281: >> Great.  Anybody else?  I will just note that as, you know, we see a lot of township islands that come before us, right?  This is the first time that I remember this idea of an area plan waiver coming into play and to read the staff report and as it notes, Mr. Kowalski thinks we're pulling it out.  We don't require an area plan if it's going to be zoned for something in R 1.  Is that -- it's when it's more than one residence. Which, again, just as another indication to me of things that are in our code that kind of wonder about a little bit. I also -- there are many times when there's something that -- I just want to put it on the record, that if it is currently zoned something and like already in the city, right? And they want to have -- they want it to be rezoned elsewhere.  I tend to not like area plans and prefer to do right to the site plan. Because usually they do have something very clearly in mind. And I want to see what it is rather than, like, have it rezoned.  This is in my mind, so, generally speaking, like, having the site plan not even having an area plan is where I go but this one is one where it's very clearly in the master plan that, like, R2 is, like the right zoning designation here.  It's -- there's R2 even closer to the lands down neighborhood than from what this is.  There's R2 farther south.  That seems an appropriate thing here.  So seeing what that looks like, I think I'm comfortable with waiving the area plan, but for those who haven't been on commission for awhile like this idea of like having an area plan which shows you what could be built even if that's not what's going to be built, comes up.  It's just we haven't seen this very often in township islands because most of the time we -- those township islands are -- we end up having the recommendation based on the master plan that they be rezoned as Rs, is that fair?
00:32:08.157: >> Yeah, this is pretty rare and the first one I actually can remember to annex straight to an R2.  Again, in this case, it made the most sense.
00:32:22.571: >> And this is the other ing, like, if there is a movement, I kind of, you know, read throug  If there's an idea having sometng that's an R 1 that's not approiate it's anotr bar that we require petionerso jumphrough in unless wdecide to waive it. Anher opportunit for us to thk about what isequired in comments Great.  I thir we're read for a vo, Mr. Kolski, we usually a rollall vote.
00:33:07.783: >> Yep.  Okay.  Seeing nobody. Okay, Mills?
00:33:13.756: >> Yes.
00:33:14.490: >> Mill ssMilshteyn.
00:33:34.376: >> Yes.
00:33:36.312: >> Clark.
00:33:36.612: >> You can just -- thumbs up. Awesome.
00:33:39.215: >> Okay.  All right.  Okay.  It is approved.
00:33:42.318: >> The motion carries.  Very good.  Now you move onto city council.  All right.  That concludes our new business.  We are onto public comment.  Item number ten.  This is an opportunity for persons to speak for up to three minutes about any item of interest. Public comment can be made by calling in.  And entering meeting ID 991-71-6409 -- sorry, 0409.  City staff will call those who raise their hands.  When you have been -- when we called on you by the last three digits of your telephone number please move to a quiet area and state your name and address at the beginning of your comments.
00:34:36.338: >> Okay.  I see one call we are their hand up.  I will, 534. Under have permission to talk now.
00:34:49.551: >> Hello, this is Tom Stulberg again.  I want to thank council person and commissioner Ditsch for talking about notice. And how we should be maybe expanding notice. And I want to relate that to what happened with the ADU ordinance revisions from a couple years ago for those of you who weren't around or didn't really know what council ended up doing right after you passed it.  There were 19,000 residences that were going to be very significantly potentially very significantly impacted.  99% of them would have no clue that literally overnight or however long it takes an ordinance revision to clear the books, they could have a buy right condition in all their neighbors houses backyards having a brand new ADU constructed within, you know, less than ten feet of their rear yard lot line.  All five of their neighbors could do it.  It would be by right the way it was handled last final for those residents not to know is why it didn't pass the council.  It's less of a question of what is specific changes are and more it was a question of the significance of the changes without the knowledge of the public.  So I think some creativity is going to be needed here to properly notify the public.  Last time it was done as an ordinance revision which had notice.  All that had to be done was to be published in the Washtenaw legal news.  That wouldn't suffice to let people know even if it's technically correct. It really wouldn't serve the intent of letting people know what was going to happen to them.  So next week we're going to talk about the ADU ordinance and I think you're going to have a lot of interest from people to expand the ADU ordinance.  I would like to see an expansion of the ADUs but ill also -- I would like to make sure we figure out how we let everybody know.  Let's 9 -- let's let 99% of the people know.
00:37:18.267: >> I see other callers on the line.  If you like to speak you can press star nine to raise your hand and indicate that.
00:37:24.773: >> Okay.  I see one more caller.  The last three digits 205.  If you unmute yourself you should be able to speak no now.
00:37:36.819: >> Howdy, this is Joe Spaulding.  I wanted to say I absolutely think the ADUs are amazing and I think 99% of everybody should know they're fantastic and great and if there's going to be more accessibility for ADUs for Ann Arbor that people should know that and I don't think that should hold up the ordinance. Let's make sure we are diligent.  I know that I trust with Dr. Ditsch there that you will check all your boxes but let's get some ADUs up because it's a very efficient and great way to expand housing options and frankly if someone wants to leave ten feet from the end of my backyard and build a structure there and live in it that's awesome.  New neighbors are awesome.  That's all I got to say.  Thank you.
00:38:24.800: >> Thank you.
00:38:25.968: >> Thank you.  I see another telephone caller on the line. If you'd like to make a comment during this public comment opportunity, you can press star nine to indicate that to us.
00:38:46.121: >> Okay, caller with the last three digits 815.  You should if able to unmute your phone now and speak.
00:38:59.268: >> Sorry, I said 215.  I think it's 815.
00:39:05.474: >> Can you hear me now?
00:39:08.410: >> We can.
00:39:08.710: >> My name's Perry Samson.  I was a little bit late getting into the last discussion because I'm not fast with the buttons but my comments were neither pro or con that development on Scio Church. Living near it we have a lot of development going on in the area.  Scio Church has four different lots that could well be developed in the future.  We have 2250 Ann Arbor Celine Road and traffic studies seem to be going on piecemeal.  Each individual project does its own traffic study.  But with this happening and I saw that in your document that there might be yet another road added somewhere between Ann Arbor, Celine and Scio Church I would argue this needs to have a more holistic view of traffic flow given all the new development having south of Ann Arbor and south of I-94 and all this potential new development here and doing it piecemeal is not going to get us good solutions for how to handle the traffic issues in this area with a growing number of vehicles.  I stand wholly behind solar, I stand wholly behind people taking the bus more and if that happens, yay, but the reality is that people are probably going to use their cars still. So I would like to encourage you to think about how to do this to work with your traffic commission to get a better study for all these things happening to see where this is going to go.  Thank you.
00:40:49.344: >> Thank you very much.  I think that exhausts the telephone callers.  So I will close this opportunity for public comment and move onto item 11 which is commission proposed business.  Is there any?
00:41:05.560: >> I don't have any.
