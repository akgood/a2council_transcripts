00:00:37.176: >> City Admin. Crawford: THE FIRST PRESENTATION IS THE D.D.A., AND WE HAVE MAURA THOMPSON ALONG WITH SOME OTHER STAFF TO KICK IT OFF.
00:00:53.192: >> Mayor Taylor: EXCELLENT.
00:00:56.328: >> THANK YOU. I WAS IN THAT WEIRD NO MAN LAND'S SPACE FOR A MOMENT. I WILL GO AHEAD AND SHARE MY SCREEN. SLIDE SHOW. AND I WILL STOP MY VIDEO, BECAUSE SOMETIMES I HAVE PROBLEMS. THANK YOU MR. CRAWFORD AND MAYOR TAYLOR, I'M MAURA THOMPSON, THE INTERRIM DIRECTOR AND COMMUNICATIONS MANAGER AT THE D.D.A., AND I AM JOINED HERE TONIGHT WITH MY COLLEAGUES SARA McCALLUM WHO IS OUR DEPUTY DIRECTOR AND ACCOUNTING DIRECTOR. SO AS YOU HAVE SEEN IN ALL OF THE BUDGET PRESENTATIONS THUS FAR, THE C CITY HAS OBJECTIVES. PROPERTY VALUES WITHIN THE DOWNTOWN INCREASE FASTER THAN THE REST OF THE CITY. IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS, PROPERTY VALUES WITHIN THE D.D.A. HAVE INCREASED AN AVERAGE OF 9.7%. SO THAT'S THAT GREEN BAR ON THE GRAPH. AND THE CITY AVERAGE IS REPRESENTED ON THE BLUE LINE AT 4.4%. SO WE ARE HAPPY TO REPORT THAT WE HAVE BEEN CONSISTENTLY MEETING THIS OBJECTIVE. THE D.D.A. HAS TWO PRIMARY REVENUE SOURCES. PARKING FEES WHICH SUPPORT THE OPERATING AND CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS ACTIVITIES IN THE PARKING SYSTEM, AND TAX INCREMENT FINANCING, BETTER KNOWN AS T.I.F. WHICH SUPPORTS THE DOWNTOWN DEVELOPMENT AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING ACTIVITIES OF THE ORGANIZATION. TOGETHER THE ACTIVITIES OF THESE TWO PRIMARY SYSTEMS CARRY OUT THE D.D.A.'S MISSION THAT YOU CAN SEE THERE IN ORANGE WHICH IS TO UNDERTAKE PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS THAT HAVE THE GREATEST IMPROVEMENT ON STRENGTHENING DOWNTOWN AND ENCOURAGING PRIVATE INVESTMENT. THE D.D.A. MANAGES THE PUBLIC PARKING SYSTEM FOR THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. THEY HAVE 8,000 SPACES WHICH INCLUDES ON STREET, SURFACE LOTS AND PARKING STRUCTURES. THE D.D.A. DOES NOT HANDLE ENFORCEMENT OF ON-STREET PARKING. WE DO NOT ISSUE TICKETS. THAT IS HANDLED BY THE CITY'S COMMUNITY STANDARDS AND THE D.D.A. DOES NOT SHARE IN THAT REVENUE. SO THE PARKING SYSTEM PREPANDEMIC. WE FEEL VERY FORTUNATE THAT THE PARKING SYSTEM ENTERED THE PANDEMIC IN A STRONG POSITION IN TERMS OF FUND BALANCE, AND THE CONDITION OF THE FACILITIES. WE HAD A $13 MILLION FUND BALANCE AT THE END OF LAST JUNE. THIS FUND BALANCE HAD BEEN BUILT UP OVER SEVERAL YEARS IN ANTICIPATION OF A MAJOR CAPITAL PROJECT. THE EXPANSION OF THE ANN ASHLEY PARKING STRUCTURE. IN HINDSIGHT. IT WAS A BLESSING THAT COUNCIL DID NOT APPROVE THAT EXPANSION BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN IN A MUCH DIFFERENT POSITION RIGHT NOW HAD THAT PROJECT MOVED FORWARD. WE ALSO ENTERED THE PANDEMIC WITH PARKING FACILITIES VERY WELL MAINTAINED, THANKS TO STRICT ONGOING ADHERENCE TO A 20-YEAR MAINTENANCE PLAN. D.D.A. STAFF WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE PARKING OPERATOR, AND AN ENGINEERING FIRM TO ENSURE THE UPKEEP OF ALL COMPONENTS OF THE PARKING SYSTEM. SO THE PANDEMIC HITS JUST ABOUT ONE YEAR AGO THIS TIME. AND THE IMPACTS TO THE PARKING SYSTEM WERE IMMEDIATE. BASICALLY, THE BOTTOM FELL OUT. AS YOU CAN SEE HERE, IN APRIL, OUR HOURLY REVENUE IN THE STRUCTURES WAS DOWN 100%. AND AS YOU MAY RECALL, ANN ARBOR RESPONDED IN THE SAME MANNER THAT PARKING FACILITIES AROUND THE COUNTRY AND WE RAISED GATE ORDERS WHILE THE STAY AT HOME ORDERS WERE IN PLACE. ON-STREET METER REVENUES WERE DOWN 99%, AND MONTHLY PERMIT REVENUE BEGAN THE MUCH SLOWER DECLINE AT 5% BACK IN APRIL, AND WE HAVE CONTINUED TO SEE THAT NUMBER DECLINE FOR YOU. WE IMMEDIATELY BEGAN FOLLOWING REVENUE REDUCTIONS AND EXPANSION REDUCTIONS. WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FY-21 BUDGET PREPARATION. AND IN STEP WITH THE CITY, WE MOVED FORWARD WITH THE PREPANDEMIC BUDGET FIGURES. THIS GRAPH SHOWS YEAR-OVER-YEAR OFF-STREET METER REVENUES FROM MARCH OF 2020. SO LAST MARCH TO THIS PAST JANUARY, FROM PARKING SYSTEMS AROUND THE COUNTRY. AND I SHOW YOU THIS JUST TO POINT OUT YOU CAN SEE THAT THE IMMEDIATE IMPACT -- THAT BIG DIP YOU SEE ON THE LEFT WAS ALMOST IDENTICAL FROM COAST-TO-COAST. SO THIS IS SHOWING L.A. TO BOSTON, TEXAS TO FLORIDA, PARKING SYSTEMS CRASHED ACROSS THE COUNTRY, AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME. THE RECOVERY IS A BIT MORE SPORADIC AND THIS IS MOST LIKELY DUE TO STATE-BY-STATE RESPONSE. BUT ANN ARBOR LANDS RIGHT ABOUT IN THE MIDDING OF THIS GRAPH, AT AROUND -- MIDDLE OF THIS GRAPH, AT 50% OF PREPANDEMIC REVENUE MSSAS OF THIS PAST JANUARY. THISSTHIS GRAPH SHOWS PARKING FS ACROSS THE SYSTEM, ON-STREET, HOURLY AND MONTHLY PERMITS. SO THAT YELLOW LINE SHOWS OUR FY-21 BUDGET, AND, YOU KNOW, AS A REMINDER, THAT WAS SET AT PREPANDEMIC LEVELS. THE GRAY BARS ARE OUR FY-20 ACTUALS. AND APRIL THROUGH JUNE IS ALMOST ENTIRELY MADE UP OF PERMIT FEES. THE GREEN BARS ARE OUR FY-21 ACTUALS. WE ARE CURRENTLY JUST UNDER 48% OF BUDGET, AND WE ARE PROJECTED TO COME IN AT ABOUT 47% OF BUDGET BY YEAR-END WHICH IS JUN. ON THE EXPENDITURE SIDE, WE MADE SIGNIFICANT CUTS IN FY-20 AND FY-21. WE IMMEDIATELY CUT 39% OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN THE LAST QUARTER OF FY-20. FISCAL YEAR '21:00 WE CUT 67% OF EXPENDITURES. REPUBLIC PARKING HAS CUT 31% OF PERSONNEL AND 22% OF OTHER OPERATIONS, THINGS LIKE THE ONGOING SMALLER MAINTENANCE ITEMS THAT THEY TAKE CARE OF ON AN ONGOING BASIS. FOR FY-22 AND '23, THE BUDGET HAS BEEN TRIMMED WAY BACK TO REFLECT PANDEMIC RECOVERY RESPONSES. SO CLEARLY THE PARKING SYSTEM IS SUFFERING SIGNIFICANT PANDEMIC RELATED IMPACT AND THE RECOVERY IS UNCERTAIN. THE D.D.A.'S OBLIGATIONS, HOWEVER, ARE VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD AND WE PRIOR ITIZE EXPENDITURES ACCORDINGLY. DEBT OBLIGATION. WE KNOW WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR DEBT, AND WE WILL BE MAKING THOSE PAYMENTS. WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE CITY RELIES ON 20% OF PARKING REVENUE TO SUPPORT GENERAL FUND ACTIVITIES WHICH IN TURN SUPPORTS OUR COMMUNITY. I WANT TO POINT O THAT IF THE RECOVERY UNFOLDSES IN AORE POSITIVE WAY THAN WE HAVE PROJECTED, YOU WILL SEE US BACK HERE BEFE YOU FOR A BUDGET AMENDMEN THE CITY'S 20% DIRECTLY CORRELATES TO REVENUES. IF REVENUES COME IN HIGHER, THEN WE WILL NEED TOMEND OUR BUDG TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE SOASICALLY BEI I'M JUST SETTINGHE STAGE THAT IFOU SE US AGAIN IT'S BECAUSEE HA GOODEWS. WE ARE ALS RESPONSIBLE F CRITICAL REPAIRS. WE MUS KEEP OUR FACILITS SAFE FOR THE PLIC. SOHINGS LIK SIRCASES, ELEVORS, CRAS AND CCRETE, MTAINTAIN OUR SYSTEM.

THOUGH THEY E OPERATINGERY LE RIGHT NOW, THE HAV STILL INTAINED A HH LEVEL OF STOMER SERVICEEI REAY D ROCATG MER BAGSORG CHAES STREET CLOSURES, IT'S A VERY LABOR INTENSIVE PROCESS AND THEY DO A REALLY GREAT JOB. WE â– WAIVEDMONTHLY PENALTIES ON PAST DUE PERMIT ACCOUNTS AND WE DID A ONE-TIME MONTHLY PERMIT FEE WAIVER. SORRY ABOUT THAT. SO NOW I WILL SWITCH GEARS TO TALK ABOUT T.I.F., OUR TAX INCREMENT FINANCING. THROUGH T.I.F., THE D.D.A. TAKES ON MAJOR INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. AGAIN GOING BACK TO OUR MISSION OF TAKING ON PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS TO STRENGTHEN DOWNTOWN, AT ITS CORE, THE D.D.A. IS AN INFRASTRUCTURE ORGANIZATION. WE HAD BETTER NEWS ON T.I.F. SIDE. REVENUES WERE NOT IMPACTED, HOWEVER WE DID NOT KNOW THE IMPLICATIONS AT THIS TIME LAST YEAR, SO AS A PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE WE DELAYED ABOUT $3.7 MILLION IN FY-20 AND '21 PROJECTS THE MAJORITY BEING THE STATE STREET IMPROVEMENT PROJECT, WHICH WAS SCHEDULED TO HAND THIS CONSTRUCTION SEASON. LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE PANDEMIC HAVE BROADENED THE LENS THROUGH WHICH WE LOOK AT OUR PROJECTS AND THE PANDEMIC HAS HIGHLIGHTED THE CRITICAL LINK BETWEEN INFRASTRUCTURE AND RESILIENCE. D.D.A. PROJECTS PLAY A ROLE IN BUILDING A STRONGER COMMUNITY. AND THE D.D.A. IS GUIDED BY A DEVELOPMENT PLAN, ESTABLISHED BACK IN 2003. THE PLAN COULD NOT HAVE ANTICIPATED A GLOBAL PANDEMIC, HOWEVER, WORKING TOWARD A LONG-TERM VISION AND A MORE RESILIENT DOWNTOWN IS SIMPLY INHERENT IN THIS WORK. A QUOTE FROM THE PLAN STATES MAINTAINING AND INVESTING IN INFRASTRUCTURE IS ESSENTIAL TO DOWNTOWN'S ONGOING STABILITY AND VITALITY. THESE WORDS REMAN REMAIN JUST AS APPLICABLE TODAY AS THEY WERE BACK IN 2003. THE ROCKEFELLER CENTER DEFINED RESILIENCE AS THE CAPACITY TO PREPARE FOR DISRUPTIONS, RECOVER FROM SHOCKS AND STRESSES, AND ADAPT AND GROW FROM A DISRUPTED EXPERIENCE. THE AIN'T TO USE OUR STREETS IN A -- THE ABILITY TO USE OUR STREETS IN A FLEXIBILITY AND ADAPTABLE WAY WAS KEY TO OUR RESPONSE HERE IN ANN ARBOR AND AROUND THE WORLD. WE HAVE USED OUR STREETS FOR BUSINESS OPERATIONS, TO IMPROVE ACCESS AND PROVIDE SPACE FOR SOCIAL DISTANCING. STREETS ARE AN ASSET AND STREET DESIGN CAN HELP COMMUNITIES PREPARE FOR AND DEAL WITH DISRUPTION. OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, THE D.D.A. HAS BEEN UNDERWAY WITH PROJECTS FRAMED BY OUR PEOPLE-FRIENDLY STREETS INITIATIVE, WHICH IS ALL ABOUT IMPROVING ACCESS AND MAKING OUR STREETS SAFE AND COMFORTABLE FOR ALL USERS. THIS MAP SHOWS A SNAPSHOT OF THOSE STREETS. SO TO ORIENT YOU A LITTLE BIT, THE STREETS IN GREEN ARE OUR COMPLETED PROJECTS AND THOSE IN PURPLE ARE CURRENT. IT STARTED WITH THE SOUTH UNIVERSITY PROJECT, BACK IN 2018, THAT'S THAT GREEN LINE ON THE BOTTOM RIGHT. WE THEN MOVED TO 5th AND DETROIT IN  2018, THE GREEN X UP THERE ON THE TOP AND THEN ON TO THE TWO PARALLEL GREEN LINES IN THE MIDDLE, WHICH REPRESENT HURON STREET AND THE WILLIAMS STREET BIKEWAY, BOTH OF WHICH WERE COMPLETED IN 2019. AND CURRENTLY THE PURPLE LINES, WE ARE WORKING ON THE FIRST ASHLEY STREET PROJECT, WHICH WILL WRAP UP THIS SUMMER IN THE VERY BEGINNING OF OUR FY-22 BUDGET SEASON. WITHIN THESE PROJECTS, WE ARE REPLACING ESSENTIAL INFRASTRUCTURE, BUT DOING SO? A WAY THAT HAS PURPOSE AND EMPHASIZES SUSTAINABILITY, SAFE ACCESS, AND CREATING MORE INVITING CIVIC SPACES. YOU CAN SEE FROM THIS GRAPH THAT FOR THESE FOUR PROJECTS, THE MAJORITY OF THE PROJECT COSTS ARE INFRASTRUCTURE RELATED, FOLLOWED BY STORMWATER IMPROVEMENTS, AND STREETLIGHT REPLACEMENT. WE ARE CURRENTLY UNDERWAY WITH DEVELOPING THE NEXT ROUND OF PEOPLE-FRIENDLY STREETS PROJECTS. I KNOW SOME OF YOU PARTICIPATED IN OUR VIRTUAL PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT WORKSHOPS A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO OR MAYBE IT WAS JUST LAST WEEK. WE HAD GREAT DIALOGUE WITH THE COMMUNITY, AND WE'RE CONTINUING WOULD THAT OUTREACH, ACTUALLY USING PAPER SURVEYS TO TRY TO REACH MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY WE WERE NOT ABLE TO REACH THROUGH OUR VIRTUAL ENGAGEMENT. PEOPLE FRIENDLY STREETS PROJECTS ARE VALUE DRIVEN. AND THE DISCUSSION OF RESILIENCE AND OUR EXPERIENCE AT THE START OF THE PANDEMIC HELPED TO SHAPE THESE VALUES:  THIS PAST JULY, THE D.D.A. BOARD ADOPTED THE VALUE SET YOU SEE ON THIS SLIDE. THESE VALUES DRIVE PLANNING AND DESIGN, AND IDENTIFYING AND PRIORITIZING PROJECTS IN -- AND ALSO HELP US MEASURE THE SUCCESS AND THE IMPACT OF OUR PROJECTS. AND THESE VALUES ALSO ALIGN WITH KEY CITY INITIATIVES, BUILDING MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING, CARBON NEUTRALITY BY 2030, AND THE 2025 VISION ZERO GOAL. THE PANDEMIC HAS HIGHLIGHTED THAT WE DON'T WANT TO REBUILD THE STATUS QUO. WE WANT TO BUILD BETTER. PEOPLE-FRIENDLY STREETS PRIORITIZED ACCESS IMPROVEMENTS FOR ALL USERS, WHETHER YOU ARE WALKING, DRIVING, TAKING THE BUS, BIKING OR IN A WHEELCHAIR. THE GOAL IS TO ENSURE THAT OUR STREETS ARE SAFE AND COMFORTABLE, NO MALTE MATTER YO, YOUR MOBILITY OR YOUR MODE OF TRANSPORTATION. PEOPLE FRIENDLY STREETS PROJECTS ALSO AIM TO HELP BUILD RESILIENT FLEXIBLE STREETS, THE PANDEMIC HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE OF ADAPTABLE STREETS INCREASING SPACE FOR PEOPLE, AND REUSING CURBSIDE SPACE. WE CAN MAKE OUR SPACE ADAPTABLE FOR EVENTS, BUSINESS OPERATIONS, PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT. THE D.D.A. HAS ALSO BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR PARTNERS AT THE ANN ARBOR HOUSING COMMISSION AND THEIR EFFORTS ON CITY-OWNED PROPERTIES IN OUR DOWNTOWN. WE ARE COORDINATING THE NEXT ROUND OF PEOPLE-FRIENDLY STREETS PROJECTS SO THAT WE CAN PROVIDE THE HOUSING COMMISSION WITH THE INFRASTRUCTURE SUPPORT THEY NEED, THINGS LIKE WATER MAIN UPSIZING AND STORMWATER IMPROVEMENTS, WHILE ALSO MEETING OTHER D.D.A. AND CITY GOALS. SO THE -- OUR PROJECTS FOR FY-22 AND '23, LIKE I SAID EARLIER, THE FIRST AND ASHLEY STREET PROJECT WILL WRAP UP THIS SUMMER. OTHER PROJECTS ON THE HORIZON, THE D.D.A. BOARD HAS COMMITTED $10 MILLION FOR THE NEXT ROUND OF PEOPLE-FRIENDLY STREETS PROJECTS WITH OVER $7 MILLION IN THE FY-22/23 BUDGET. STATE STREET IMPROVEMENT PROJECT WHICH IS A PARTNERSHIP WITH CITY ENGINEERING IS SCHEDULED TO GET UNDERWAY IN 2022 CONSTRUCTION SEASON. SO ABOUT THIS TIME NEXT YEAR. THE TWO PROJECTS -- OH, I'M SORRY. AND I MISSED THE DIVISION STREET BIKEWAY, WHICH IS A PROJECT THAT INITIATED FROM ONE OF OUR PILOTS LAST YEAR, WHICH WE ARE PLANNING TO MAKE PERMANENT HOPEFULLY THIS FALL. AND THE TWO PROJECTS LISTED IN RED ARE OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE AS THEY ARE THE PROJECT THAT WE ARE WORKING ON WITH OUR PARTNERS AT THE HOUSING COMMISSION, AND THE TRIPLE A.T.A. MILLER/CATHERINE STREET, WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SUPPORT THE HOUSING COMMISSION'S EFFORT ON THE FOURTH AND CATHERINE PARKING LOT AND ALSO TO MAKE ANOTHER CONNECTION IN THE PROTECTED BIKE LANE NETWORK AND ADDRESS A TIER ONE OR HIGH CRASH CORRIDOR NOTED IN THE CITY'S TRANSPORTATION MASTER PLAN. THIS WILL LIKELY OCCUR IN 2022, AHEAD OF THE HOUSING COMMISSION'S PROJECT ON FOURTH AND CATHERINE, BUT WE STAY IN CLOSE CONNECTION WITH THE HOUSING COMMISSION TO MONITOR THE TIMING ON THAT. FOURTH AVENUE STREET AND TRANSIT IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS ANOTHER COLLABORATIVE PROJECT. NOT ONLY ARE WE WORKING WITH THE HOUSING COMMISSION, BUT ALSO THE A.A.A.T.A. THIS WILL SUPPORT THE HOUSING COMMISSION'S WORK AT 350 SOUTH 5th ALONG WITH STREETSCAPE IMPROVEMENTS TO SUPPORT TRANSIT OPERATIONS AT BLAKE AND PROVIDE A SAFER AND BETTER EXPERIENCE FOR TRANSIT USERS ON 4th AVE. WE HAVE BUILT CAPACITY IN OUR FY-22/23 BUDGET FOR THIS PROJECT, HOWEVER, THE TIMING IS YET TO BE DETERMINED AND WE CONTINUE WORKING WITH OUR PARTNERS AS THIS PROJECT TAKES SHAPE. T.I.F. DOLLARS HAVE FUNDED MUCH OF OUR PANDEMIC RESPONSE IN SUPPORT OF THE DOWNTOWN BUSINESS COMMUNITY. GIVEN THE WAY THIS CRISIS HAS UNFOLDED, THE FUNDING FOR THIS SUPPORT SPANS THE D.D.A.'S NY-20, '21 AND NOW '22 BUDGETS. WE PROVIDED $50,000 FOR BARRICADES FOR THE STREET CLOSURE PROGRAM. THE D.D.A. FUNDED THIS EMERGENCY EFFORT LAST YEAR, AND THANKS TO COUNCIL'S APPROVAL OF THE STREET CLOSURES AGAIN THIS YEAR, THE D.D.A. WILL PROVIDE THAT SAME LEVEL OF SUPPORT. THE D.D.A. ALSO FUNDED ALL OF THE SIDEWALK OCCUPANCY PERMITS FOR DOWNTOWN BUSINESSES LAST YEAR, AND WE WILL DO SO AGAIN THIS YEAR. WE PROVIDED SIGNAGE AND POSTERS AND ADS WITH PUBLIC HEALTH MESSAGES LAST YEAR AND WE ARE WORKING WITH OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE CITY COMMUNICATIONS DEPARTMENT THIS YEAR ON SOME MORE LIMITED SIGNAGE, THINKING THAT MOST OF US KIND OF KNOW THE DRILL BY NOW, BUT WE WILL GET SOME SIGNAGE UP THERE. OTHER PANDEMIC SUPPORT OUT OF T.I.F. INCLUDED DISTRIBUTING 500 BOXES OF P.P.E. TO THE DOWNTOWN COMMUNITY. LANDSCAPING AND MARKETING SUPPORT TO THE DOWNTOWN ASSOCIATIONS. WE INSTALLED PILOT PROJECTS TO PROVIDE MORE SPACE FOR SOCIAL DISTANCING. WE FUNDED MURALS BY FOUR LOCAL ARTISTS AND WE INSTALLED A HAND WASHING STATION ON MAIN STREET. THE D.D. A. ALSO PROVIDE ANNUAL COMMUNITY SUPPORTN AN ONGOING BASIS. IN FY-22 AND '23 THROUGH THE PARKING SYSTEM, THE D.D. A WILL PROVID-- D.A.A WILL PROVI THE ANNUA FUNDI FOR THE GET DOWNTOWN PROGRAM WE WIL CONTINUE TOANAGE THE PARKIN IN THEIKE HOUSE AND THE BIKEOOPS AND THE LOCKERS AND IN A TYPICALEAR, WE WOULD WAIV OVER $300,0 IN METER BAG FE FOR NONOFITS HAVING EVEN IN OUR DOWNTOWN. SO ART FAIR, SUMME FEST, TAS OF ANN AOR, THE AFRICAN AMERICAN FESTIVAL, DANCING IN THE STREE, KINDLE FES AND TH LIST GOES ONND ON. WHENEVERT'SAFE FOR THOSE TYPES OF EVES TOCCUR, W STAND READYO SPORT. AND FINAL, THROUGH OUR- THROUGH T.I.F. IN F22 AND 3, AS WE ALWS DO, W WILL BE PROVIDING T CY WITH OVER HA AILLION DOLLARS IN PPORT OF G O THE JUSTICE CENT. REPAIR AND MAINTENCE.LK WEILL CONTRIBUT $150,000 TO THITY'S STRTLIGHT REACEMENT PROGRAM, AND WE WILL ANSFER $330,0 INTO THE D.D.A.'S AFFORDABL HOUSING FUND. $100,000 TO SUPPORT T HOLIDAY LIGHTS YOU SEE IN OUR DOWNTOWN EES, A FINALLY,HE D.D.A WILL BE GETTING UNDERWAYITH A CURBSI MANAGEMENT SDYN FY-2 RBSIDE DEMD H AEADY BEEN THINGS LE RIDEHARE APP AND CREASED DELIVERIES. WE WERE ALREATARTING TO SEE SOME CHANG AND WITH T PANDEMIC, THE COMPETING NEEDS FOR CURBSIDE SPACE HAVE INCREASED AND THE TREND. CHANGE WE WERE ALREADY SEEING HAS JUST ACCELERATED. SO AN RFP FOR THAT STUDY, WE ARE HOPING TO GET OUT THE DOOR IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS. AND FUNDING FOR THAT STUDY WILL BE SPLIT BETWEEN OUR PARKING AND OUR T.I.F. FUNDS. AND NOW, I AM GOING TO HAND IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE, SARA McCALLUM.
00:23:28.946: >> THANK YOU, MAURA. CAN EVERYBODY HEAR ME?
00:23:32.783: >> Mayor Taylor: YES, WE CAN.
00:23:33.551: >> GREAT. GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE. SARA McCALLUM HERE, D.D.A. DEPUTY DIRECTOR AND ACCOUNTING DIRECTOR. WE APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THE TIME TO RECEIVE OUR BUDGET PRESENTATION TONIGHT. AND WE'RE ALMOST AT THE END. WE HAVE TWO MORE SLIDES TO GO THROUGH, THE ONES WITH THE BUDGET NUMBERS. MAURA, CAN YOU GO FORWARD ONE?
00:23:55.773: >> SORRY ABOUT THAT.
00:23:56.741: >> THAT'S OKAY. SO THESE MAY LOOK FAMILIAR TO SOME OF YOU. THEY ARE IN THE SAME FORMAT AS PREVIOUS YEARS AND IN THE SAME FORMAT THAT IS INCLUDED IN THE CITY'S BUDGET DOCUMENT. THE FIRST ONE PRESENTS INFORMATION ORGANIZED BY CATEGORY, AND THE NEXT SLIDE HAS THE SAME INFORMATION ORGANIZED BY FUND. BOTH SLIDES REPRESENT REVENUES IN THE BLUE SECTION AT THE TOP AND THE EXPENDITURES IN THE ORANGE SECTION ON THE BOTTOM. AND BOTH PRESENT FIVE COLUMNS OF INFORMATION. ACTUAL ACTIVITY FOR FISCAL YEAR '20, BOTH THE WILL BUDGET AND PROJECTED ACTUAL FOR '21, AND PROPOSED BUDGETS FOR '22 AND '23. WE'LL SPEND MOST OF OUR TIME ON THE NEXT SLIDE, THE ONE THAT'S ORGANIZED BY FUND, BUT I DID WANT TO POINT OUT A COUPLE OF ITEMS ON THIS ONE, BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO THAT. SO THE FIRST THING YOU MIGHT NOTICE, IF YOU GLANCE AT THE TOTAL REVENUES FOR ALL CATEGORIES THAT FIRST GRAY ROW BELOW THE -- IN THE BLUE SECTION, IS THAT SOMETHING IS CLEARLY UP WITH THE FISCAL YEAR '21 BUDGET. TOTAL REVENUES IN THAT COLUMN ARE $62.6 MILLION, COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY $30 MILLION IN THE OTHER COLUMNS, AND THERE'S A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT REASONS FOR THIS. THE FIRST HAS TO DO WITH OPERATING TRANSFERS IN, WHICH IS THE ROW THAT YOU WILL SEE KIND OF IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT REVENUE SECTION, THAT FOURTH ROW DOWN. FISCAL YEAR '21 BUDGET HAS $11 MILLION IN THIS LINE ITEM. SO THAT'S OVER DOUBLE WHAT IS IN THE OTHER COLUMNS. THE THING TO KNOW ABOUT THIS ITEM IS THAT IT DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR CASH RECEIVED. THE WAY WE TYPICALLY THINK OF REVENUE, IT ACCOUNTS FOR MONEY THAT HAS SHIFTED FROM ONE D.D.A. FUND TO ANOTHER D.D.A. FUND. SO WE HAVE TWO FUNDS THAT ARE PRIMARILY FUNDED THROUGH THESE TRANSFERS. THE HOUSING FUND, WHICH IS FUNDED BY TRANSFERS FROM THE GENERAL T.I.F. FUND AND THE PARKING CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT FUND WHICH IS FUNDED BY TRANSFERS FROM THE PARKING FUND. NECESSITY THEY DON'T HAVE THEIRN REVENUE STREAMS AND THEY ARE FUNDED ENTIRELY BY TRANSFERS IN. THE IMPORTANT THING TO KNOW HERE IS THAT THIS DOESN'T REPRESENT A BUMP IN REVENUES BUT SHIFTING MONEY FROM ONE POCKET TO ANOTHER. THE NEXT ITEM OF INTEREST IS ON THE ROW BELOW THAT, PRIOR YEAR SURPLUS. THAT'S THE FIFTH ROW DOWN. THIS IS ANOTHER LINE ITEM THAT DOES NOT REPRESENT CASH IN. THIS IS A CATEGORY THAT'S ESTABLISHED BY THE CITY'S BUDGET PROCESS TO ACCOUNT FOR ANY SPEND DOWN OF FUND BALANCE, AND YOU WILL NOTE THAT THOSE NUMBERS ARE ONLY INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET COLUMNS. SO NOT IN THE ACTIVITY FOR FISCAL YEAR '20, NOT NOT PROJECTED ACTIVITY FOR FISCAL YEAR '21. SO THAT'S SOMETHING TO KEEP IN MIND WHEN YOU COMPARE COLUMN TO COLUMN. THE LAST ITEM OF NOTE IS THE FINAL CATEGORY IN THE REVENUE SECTION, BOND PROCEEDS. THE CITY ISSUED BONDS ON BEHALF OF THE D.D.A. IN 2019, AND IT HOLDS THOSE FUNDS AND THEN REIMBURSES US FROM THE PROCEEDS FOR OUR CONSTRUCTION EXPENDITURES. SO THIS IS THE REVENUE SIDE OF THAT. THE BOND PROCEEDS. THE CONSTRUCTION PERIOD EXTENDS OVER THREE YEARS. SO THIS IS A TEMPORARY CATEGORY FUND THAT WILL BE CLOSED IN FISCAL YEAR '22. SO THAT'S WHY YOU SEE THE FADING OUT FOR FISCAL YEAR '23. OKAY AND YOU CAN MOVE ON TO THAT NEXT SLIDE THEN. AND TAKE A LOOK AT THE D.D.A.'S BUDGET BY FUND. SO THE D.D.A. AS MAURA EXPLAINED HAS TWO MAIN ACTIVITY CENTERS, BUT IT HAS FIVE FUNDS. TWO OF THOSE WERE ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE AUTHORITY'S PARKING SYSTEM AND THE OTHER TWO ACCOUNT FOR THE DOWNTOWN DEVELOPMENT -- OR THE OTHER THREE ACCOUNT FOR THE DOWNTOWN DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES. SO WE ARE GOING TO START BY TALKING ABOUT THE PARKING SYSTEM, WHICH IS COMPRISED OF THE PARKING FUND, WHICH IS THE PARKING OPERATING F AND THE PARKING CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT FUND. THESE FUNDS ARE FUNDED BY PARKING FEES AND TRANSFERS, ONE FROM THE PARKING FUND TO THE C.I.P. AND THEN THE ACTIVITIES ACCOUNTED FOR HERE ARE OPERATIONS, ADMINISTRATION, DEBT SERVICE, ABOUT 50% OF OUR DEBT SERVICE IS ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE PARKING FUND. THE CITY, 20% PAYMENT, SOME GRANTS, PRIMARILY TO THE A.A.A.T.A., AND CAPITAL MAINTENANCE AND IMPROVEMENTS. SO IF WE JUST KIND OF GO, AND WE ARE GOING TO WORK OUR WAY LEFT TO RIGHT, FISCAL YEAR '20 ACTIVITY, THE PANDEMIC HIT AS MAURA MENTIONED IN THE THIRD -- IT'S KIND OF THE VERY TAIL END OF THE THIRD QUARTER. WE SUFFERED A LOSS OF ABOUT $5.7 MILLION FOR THAT YEAR. SO IT REPRESENTS ABOUT 30% OF OUR OVERALL REVENUES FOR FISCAL YEAR '20. ONE OF THE CHANGES WE IMPLEMENTED IN RESPONSE TO THAT WAS TO REDUCE TRANSFERS OUT TO THE C.I.P. FUND, THAT WAS MINIMIZED SO WE COULD RETAIN THAT FUND BALANCE THAT WE HAD IN THE OPERATING FUND, WHICH IS THE FUND THAT WAS AFFECTED BY THE LOSS OF PARKING FEES. MOVING TO THE RIGHT, TO FISCAL YEAR '21 BUDGET, OF COURSE, THESE ARE THOSE PREPANDEMIC LEVELS, AS WAS APPROVED. AND FOR THE PARKING FUND, YOU SEE THAT $31 MILLION NUMBER, THAT INCLUDES $6 MILLION OF PRIOR YEAR SURPLUS. SO THAT REPRESENTS THAT SPEND DOWN OF FUND BALANCE. THE REMAINING $25 MILLION IS PRIMARILY MADE UP OF PARKING FEES, AND THE C.I.P. -- THE PARKING C.I.P. FUND FOR THIS YEAR, YOU WILL SEE $11.3 MILLION, AND THAT THAT'S THE TRANSFER FROM THE PARKING FUN. AGAIN, ALL PREPANDEMIC NUMBERS AS BUDGETED, FOR CAPITAL PROJECTS THAT WERE PLANNED. MOVING OVER THEN TO FISCAL YEAR '21 PROJECTED, OF COURSE WE ANTICIPATE OUR ACTUAL ACTIVITY FOR FISCAL YEAR '21 TO BE MUCH REDUCED. AND THE PARKING FUND WE ARE PROJECTING $12.3 MILLION IN PARKING FEES, VERSUS THE $25 MILLION THAT WAS BUDGETED. SO THAT, YOU KNOW, THAT 47 TO 49% OF BUDGET LEVELS AND THEN IN THE C.I.P. FUND, THE TRANSFER IN IS REDUCED AS WELL, JUST LIKE WE DID IN FISCAL YEAR '20, WE CUT THAT DOWN TO $4.7 MILLION THAT'S ABOUT A 58% REDUCTION OF THAT BUDGETED $11.2 MILLION. AND THEN MOVING OVER TO THE LEFT AGAIN, FOR FISCAL YEAR '22 AND '23, WE ARE PROJECTING PARKING REVENUES OF $14.7 MILLION, SO THAT BRINGS US UP FROM THAT KIND OF 48, 49% UP TO 58% OF FISCAL YEAR '21 BUDGET AND FOR FISCAL YEAR '23, WE'RE BUMPING THAT UP AGAIN TO ABOUT $18 MILLION OR 72% OF THE FISCAL YEAR '21 BUDGET NUMBERS. AND FOR THE C. I.P. FUND, TRANSFERS IN WE'RE PLANNING ABOUT $2.6 MILLION FOR BOTH YEARS. JUST ENOUGH TO COVER VERY MINIMAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURE LEVELS SO WE CAN FIND OF MAINTAIN ADEQUATE FUND LEVEL -- FUND BALANCE LEVELS. EXPENDITURES. SO WE'RE MOVING DOWN TO THE ORANGE SECTION NOW. GOING BACK TO FISCAL YEAR '20 ACTIVITY, AT THE LEFT SIDE. SO THOSE COST CUTTING MEASURES THAT MAURA MENTIONED WERE IMPLEMENTED IMMEDIATELY WHEN THE PACK DEMIC HIT, PUTTING A -- PANDEMIC PUTTING A HOLD ON ALL THE CRITICAL CAPITAL MAINTENANCE ITEMS. WE WERE ALREADY 75% THROUGH THE YEAR AT THAT TIME. WE WERE ABLE TO END THE YEAR WITH A SLIGHT INCREASE TO THE OVERALL PARKING SYSTEM FUND BALANCE AS WE HEADED INTO '21. SO AS MAURA MENTIONED THAT FUND BALANCE AT 6/30/20 WAS ABOUT $16 MILLION. FOR THE PREPANDEMIC NUMBERS, WE HAD THE PARKING FUND AT $31 MILLION, INCLUDING A 10.$6 MILLION TRANSFER OUT TO THE C.I.P. FUND, WHICH, OF COURSE WAS REDUCED. THE REMAINING $20.4 MILLION IS MADE UP OF OPERATIONAL COSTS. THE CITY'S 20%, DEBT SERVICE, GRANTS, ADMINISTRATION, AGAIN ALL AT PREPANDEMIC LEVELS. MOVING OVER TO PROJECTED, THOSE NUMBERS WERE REDUCED TO ABOUT 55% OF BUDGET AROUND THE $17 MILLION MARK. PRETTY MUCH IN LINE WITH THE REVENUE LOSSES. THE REDUCTION AND WHAT WE TRANSFERRED OUT TO C.I.P., OF COURSE, REPRESENTS THE LARGEST PORTION OF THIS. REDUCED BY 72% TO THAT $4.7 MILLION NUMBER. OF BUT OTHER CATEGORIES WERE REDUCED SIGNIFICANTLY AS WELL. EVEN WITH THESE COMPREHENSIVE REDUCTIONS, WE DO ANTICIPATE THAT FUND BALANCE WILL BE SPENT DOWN AS MUCH AS $6 MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR '21. SO THIS SHOULD BE THE YEAR HARDEST HIT BY THE EFFECTS OF THE PANDEMIC AND AS MAURA MENTIONED, WE WERE VERY FORTUNATE TO HAVE A $13 MILLION FUND BALANCE TO HELP US RIDE OUT THIS CHALLENGING TIME. SO MOVING FORWARD TO '22 AND '23, EXPENDITURES HERE ARE BUDGETED TO ALLOW US TO MAINTAIN, AGAIN, THOSE ADEQUATE FUND BALANCE LEVELS IN THE PARKIN SYSTEM WITH CONTINUED REDUCED LEVELS OF OPERATING AND ADMINISTRATION COSTS, AND MINIMUM LEVELS OF CAPITAL INTENANCE. ABOUT $2.6 MLION FOR EACH YEAR. I WANT TO EMPHASIZE HERE THAT MAINTENANCE REPRESENT A DEFERMENT OF COSTS RATHER THA A DUCTION. THE WK IS STILL NECESSARY IT'S JT DELAYED TO A LATER DATE WITH THE SUCTURES I GOODANDEMI REPAIR, THIS DEFERNT IS LES OTHERWISE,UT WE STILLNOWE AT, YOU KW, THAT WORK WL HAVE TO BE DONEN THE FUTURE. EV WITH THESE REDED EXPENDITUREEVELS SOM ADDITION SPENDOWN WILLE NECESSY. FISCAL ', T BUDGET DOES ANTIPATE A SPEND DOWN O 2.8 $2.8 MLION, MUCHMALLERN ANDHENN '23700,000. AND FORISCAL YEARS ' AND TLYING YEA, TEN-YR PLAN CALLS FOR A STEADY RECERY AND ANNUAL INCASES TO CITAL SO IT BEARS NOTG HEREHATOW PARKG FEE PROJECTIONS ARE HIGHLY UNCERTA AT THIS TE. FOR THAT REASO OUR GOA WASO CONSEATIVE IN OUR ESMATIONS AND THINK WE ACHIEVED THAT. OWN TE WILL TELL,UT WE WILL CONTUE - ONLY TIM WL TELL, BUTE LL CONTIE TO MITOR THE REVENS MONTHLY AND ADJUST EXPENDURE LEVELS WITH AN EYE ON MAINTAIN SUFFICIENT FUND LEVEL BALANCES FOR THE OVERALL SYSTEM WHILE PRIORITIZING THE MOST CRITICAL MAINTENANCE ITEMS IN THE STRUCTURE. SO NOW, WE'RE GOING TO MOVE FORWARD TO TALKING ABOUT THE DOWNTOWN DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM FUNDS. THESE WILL BE A LOT MORE STRAIGHTFORWARD AND SIMPLER TO GET THROUGH. ALMOST THERE. SO THIS AGAIN, DOWNTOWN DEVELOPMENT IS COMPRISED OF THREE FUNDS. THAT'S THE GENERAL T.I.F. FUND, THE HOUSING FUND AND THE T.I.F. CONSTRUCTION FUND, WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR THOSE BOND DOLLARS. SO THOSE FUNDS ARE FUNDED BY TAX BY T.I.F. DOLLARS, TRANSFERS IN THE CASE OF HOUSING AND BOND PROCEEDS IN THE CASE OF THE CONSTRUCTION FUND. ACTIVITIES ARE PRIMARILY CAPITAL CONSTRUCTION, DEBT SERVICE, GRANTS AND SOME ADMINISTRATION. AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND, AGAIN, CAPITAL CONSTRUCTION WITH THE BOND DOLLARS. I WILL TAKE A LITTLE BUILT OF A DIFFERENT TACT AS I GO THROUGH THESE. I THINK IT WILL BE MORE HELPFUL TO REVIEW THEM BY FUND RATHER THAN GOING ACROSS THE COLUMNS OR NEARS SO FOR THE GENERAL T.I.F. FUNDS, THEY REMAIN VERY CONSISTENT AND THE PLAN REMAINS SO THROUGH 2023. ANY VARIATIONS ARE DUE TO PLANNED SPEND DOWNS OF FUND BALANCE TO DO CAPITAL PROJECTS. AND ON THE EXPENDITURE SIDE, IT'S THE SAME THING. IF YOU SEE VARIATIONS, IT'S DUE TO THE CAPITAL PROJECTS BEING PLANNED IN THAT FUND. THE HOUSING FUND, CITY ORDINANCE IDENTIFIES THE ANNUAL TRANSFER TRANSFERFROM T.I.F. TO D.D.A. EXPENDITURES ARE BUDGETED JUST KIND OF TO MATCH THOSE FUNDING LEVELS TO GIVE THE D.D.A. BOARD THE FLEXIBILITY TO CONSIDER ANY HOUSING PROJECTS THAT MAY BE PRESENTED THAT WE PITCH TO SUPPORT. THE LAST FUND TO DISCUSS IS THE CONSTRUCTION FUND AND THIS ONE IS REALLY QUICK AND EASY. THAT'S A TEMPORARY FUND. IT WILL BE CLOSED IN '22 AND THAT BRINGS US TO THE END OF THE PRESENTATION. THANK YOU, EVERYONE.
00:38:07.591: >> Mayor Taylor: EXCELLENT. THANKS VERY MUCH. WE SHOULD PROBABLY GO TO QUESTIONS HERE.
00:38:25.842: >> City Admin. Crawford: YES, MAYOR. THAT WOULD BE GREAT.
00:38:29.112: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
00:38:30.013: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU FOR PROVIDING THIS INFORMATION AND I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS AND PERHAPS A POLICY ISSUE THAT AS WE TALK ABOUT OUR BUDGETS AND HOW THEY COMMINGLE. ON PAGE 6, WE TALK ABOUT THE PERMITS AND THEY DECLINE BY 5% FROM THAT FIRST MONTH OR TWO IN THE PANDEMIC. DO WE HAVE ANY INFORMATION ON WHERE IT IS A YEAR LATER, TEN MONTHS LATER WHAT IS THE REDUCTION WITH THOSE HOLLERS OF THE MONTHLY PERMITS -- THE HOLDERS OF THE MONTHLY PERMITS.
00:39:08.285: >> WE DO HAVE THAT INFORMATION. I DON'T HAVE IT OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD. SARA, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE THAT WITH YOU. I CAN GET THAT TO YOU TOMORROW TO LET US KNOW WHERE WE ARE.
00:39:18.094: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, MAURA. I THINK PERHAPS LET ALL OF US KNOW THE BOND -- YOU KNOW, THOSE BOND COVENANTS ARE DEPENDENT ON THOSE PERMIT HOLDERS, AND TO KNOW WHERE WE STAND WITH THOSE. ON PAGE 8, WE TALK ABOUT THE 48% PROJECTION. I KNOW WHEN THE GUY WAS FALLING, WE WERE ALL TAKING OUR BEST STABS AT WHAT TO EXPECT. I THOUGHT AT THE TIME OF THE DISCUSSIONS THERE WERE THREE PESSIMISTIC SCENARIOS OR THREE SCENARIOS THAT ALL SHOWED A NEGATIVE RESULTS OF THE BUDGET. WHERE DID WE LIE? DID WE KNOW IF WE WERE, LIKE, ONE OF THE BETTER CASES? WORST CASE IN THE MIDDLE OF THOSE EARLY ON THREE SCENARIOS?
00:40:21.124: >> WELL, RIGHT IN THE BEGINNING WE DID THREE, SIX AND NINE-MONTH SCENARIOS. AT THE TIME, WE THOUGHT, WHY WOULD YOU BOTHER DOING SIX AND NINE-MONTH SCENARIOS AND I KNOW SARA'S PROJECTIONS HAVE BEEN REMARKABLY CLOSE, BUT SARA, DO YOU HAPPEN -- AGAIN, I CAN GET YOU THIS INFORMATION. I DON'I DON'T HAVE IT RIGHT HER. DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT YOU HAD?
00:40:44.347: >> I THINK WE ARE PROBABLY CLOSER TO THE WORST, BUT NOT -- BUT NOT ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE VERY WORST. ALTHOUGH IT'S EXTENDED LONGER OUT THAN WE EVER ANTICIPATED INITIALLY, AND BY THE WAY, THE PERMITS QUESTION, WE'RE AT ABOUT 55% RIGHT NOW.
00:41:02.699: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  55% OF WHERE WE WERE PREPANDEMIC?
00:41:06.636: >> YES.
00:41:06.903: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  WE HAVE LOST 45%?
00:41:08.838: >> WE HAVE.
00:41:15.345: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: WOW. THAT'S SCARY. THANK YOU ON THAT QUICK TURNAROUND. I GUESS THE OTHER ISSUE AND THANKFULLY, WE -- WE JUST BY HAPPENSTANCE WERE ABLE TO COME INTO THIS WITH A GOOD FUND BALANCES AND I THINK THAT HAS HELPED MANY PEOPLE IN THIS PANDEMIC THAT WE ENDED IT WITH A TEN-YEAR BULL ECONOMY. AND SO GOING INTO IT IN GOOD SHAPE. MY CONCERN IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN SOMETHING ELSE HAPPENS AS WE EXPERIENCE IN CAPITALISM AND THIS WAS NOT WILL BROUGHT ON BY SOME OF THE OTHER FACTORS OF THE CAPITALISM. IN A YEAR, TWO YEARS, THREE YEARS, FIVE YEARS FROM NOW WE MAY EXPERIENCE SOMETHING LIKE WE EXPERIENCED MANY TIMES BEFORE AND JUST TOO KEEP OURSELVES GUARDED TO THAT FACT, IF WE WOULD. MY OTHER QUESTION IS REALLY ABOUT THE STREET MAINTENANCE AND THE BIKE LANES ADDING MORE BIKE LANES. AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT OUR COST AND MAINTENANCE ABOUT A MONTH AGO. STAFF SAID WE SPEND ABOUT $277,000 CLEANING BIKE LANES. HAS THE D.D.A. CONSIDERED SHARING THESE ONGOING MAINTENANCE COSTS WHEN THEY ARE ADDING IN THESE INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS?
00:42:40.830: >> THAT'S NOT A DISCUSSION WE HAD WITH PUBLIC WORKS. WE HAVEN'T ABOUT APPROACHED ON THAT.
00:42:49.039: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: OKAY. THANKS. PERHAPS THAT'S A CONVERSATION FOR A DIFFERENT DAY AND I APPRECIATE THAT AND I WILL FOLLOW UP LATER ON THAT. THANK YOU.
00:42:58.648: >> MM-HMM.
00:42:58.948: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
00:43:00.116: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES, THANK YOU FOR A CONCISE AND INFORMATIVE PRESENTATION. YOU MENTIONED STREETLIGHTS A FEW TIMES AND MOST OF YOU KNOW THAT I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT STREETLIGHTS FOR SOMETIME. AND YOU MENTIONED 11% FUNDING ON STREETLIGHTS AND MANY OF THOSE LIGHTS ARE THE VERY ATTRACTIVE PEDESTRIAN LIGHTS THAT ARE ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. THE QUESTION I HAVE IS WHEN WE'RE REPLACING THE TRADITIONAL STREET HEIGHTS WITH THE PEDESTRIAN LIGHT -- LIGHTS, WITH THE PEDESTRIAN LIGHTS, WE ARE ENSURING THAT WE HAVE ADEQUATE POSITIVE CONTRAST LIGHTING AT ALL OF OUR CROSSWALKS. I DON'T NECESSARILY NEED AN ANSWER RIGHT NOW, BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT -- THAT'S A QUESTION THAT HAS BEEN RAISED TO ME. ANOTHER ISSUE IS THAT WE HAVE ADOPTED VISION ZERO AND I DID SIT IN ON SOME OF THE PEOPLE-FRIENDLY STREETS PRESENTATION, AND I'M WONDERING IF WE'RE LOOKING AT THE AREAS WITH THE HIGHEST CRASH INCIDENTS AND ONE OF THE SOLUTIONS IS TO CREATE HARD LEFT TURNS TO YOU BUILD OUT A MEDIAN SO THAT A PERSON CANNOT TAKE A LEFT-HAND TURN AT THE 40 MILES PER HOUR THAT WE ARE SEEING DOWNTOWN IN SOME CASES NOW. AND SO I'M WONDER IF THAT'S BEING CONSIDERED.
00:44:37.614: >> THANK YOU FOR THOSE QUESTIONS. I CAN TELL YOU ON THE STREETLIGHT REPLACEMENTS. THE WORK WE DO IN OUR PROJECTS AND COLLABORATION WITH THE CITY WHERE WE CONTRIBUTE TO THE STREETLIGHT REPLACEMENT FUND, WE WORK DIRECTLY WITH CITY ENGINEERING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE COMFLY COMPLYING WITH ALL TE STANDARDS FOR SAFETY. AND AS FAR AS OUR STREETS, THE POLITICALLER AN CATHERINE STREET -- MILLER AND THE CATHERINE STREET HAVE BEEN CALLED OUT IN THE TRANSPORTATION MASTER PLAN AS TIER ONE, YOU KNOW, HIGHER CRASH AREAS AND I THINK YOU ARE REFERRING TO BUMP OUTS TO HELP WITH THOSE LEFT-HAND TURNS AND WE DO INSTALL BUMP OUTS IN MANY OF OUR PROJECTS. I DON'T KNOW -- WE'RE NOT AT THAT STAGE YET ON UPCOMING PROJECTS, DIVISION OR, MILLER, CATHERINE TO GIVE YOU THOSE SYSTEMS. YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ALWAYS CONSIDER AND INSTALL WHEN POSSIBLE.
00:45:37.273: >> Councilmember Griswold: OKAY. AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE BUMP OUTS THAT I'M SEEING AROUND TOWN. THIS IS ACTUALLY MORE OF A LITTLE MEDIAN THAT GOES OUT BEYOND THE CROSSWALK, BUT WE CAN TALK ABOUT IT ANOTHER TIME.
00:45:48.718: >> OH, OKAY.
00:45:49.919: >> Councilmember Griswold: AND MY LAST QUESTION IS, IS THE D.D.A. ABLE TO MONITOR STREETLIGHTUTAGES. I KNOWE USE A2 FIXT AND IT WORKS WELL IN RESIDTIAL AREAS BECAUSE PEOPLE THINK OF A THEIR OWN AND THEY REPORT IT. AND IN THE D.D.A. THAT'S NOT THE SE. KNOW THAT THE CITY AND THE D.D.A. HE ON ABOUT WORKING ON. TH I'M WONDERI WHAT T STATUS IS OF TRYGO MAINTAIN THE STRTLIGHTS IN A WKING CONDITN.
00:46:24.287: >> YES,R. CRAWFORD A I HAVE HAD DISCUSSNS ABOUT THIS. D I PASD O THAT IORMATION TO THE ARE ASSOCIATION WHO I KNOW WT DIRECTL TO SINESSES AND RUBLIC PARKING. SO W HAVE REPUBLIC PARKING STAFF MAKING SUR TT I TY SEEN OUTAGE, THEY REPORT IT AND IAN TELL Y THAT FORWO PARTULAR BUSINES OWNERS, I OW THEY HAVE BEEN NOW REPORTINGINCE W WE AED THEM TO, AND WE HAVHAD SOMEE PAIRS DE. I THINK IT'S AN EFFORT WE N NTINUE WORNG ON, B I THINK EVEN A LTLE B OF MMUNICATION WT A LONG WAY. Councilmemb Griswold: OKAY THAT'S REALLY GREAT NEWS. HAYNER.Taylor:OUNCILMEMBER THANKS,R. MAYOR AND THANKS F THE PRESENTATION. A CPLE OF THINGS REA QUICK. ONE, I PROMISED NT TIME I GOT INRONT OF THE D.D.A., I YOU'RE PKING APP SHOULD BE KE THE DROIT PARNG APP, TH WL NOTIFYOUHENHEIR EY FL THE DESPITEARNG P IS MUCH -- DETROIT PARKING APP IS MUCH MORE PROGRESSIVE. I DON'T USE THE APP MYSELF, BUT YOU MENTIONED A -- YOU SAID THAT -- YOU MENTIONED THE CRITICAL LINK BETWEEN INFRASTRUCTURE AND RESILIENCE, AND I WAS TAKING SOME NOTES AND WRITING SOME STUFF DOWN AND I WONDER IF YOU COULD REDEFINE THAT FOR ME. WHAT DID WE FIND TO BE THE CRITICAL LINK BETWEEN INFRASTRUCTURE AND RESILIENCE, THAT'S MY FIRST QUESTION.
00:48:05.254: >> WELL, I MEAN, A FEW THINGS. I THINK, YOU KNOW, OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SPACE FOR PEOPLE HELPED US BE MORE RESILIENCE. OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE SPACE FOR BUSINESS OPERATIONS. I KNOW FROM --
00:48:24.007: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YOU MEAN HELP THE CITY BE MORE RESILIENT, OR THE D.D.A. OR DOWNTOWN?
00:48:27.944: >> THE COMMUNITY. THE COMMUNITY. AND THEN WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT OTHER CRISIS, RIGHT, LIKE NOT JUST PUBLIC HEALTH BUT MAYBE IT'S CLIMATE RELATED SO WE KNOW THAT A LOT OF THE WORK THAT WE DO, LIKE WITH STORMWATER WORK IN OUR PROJECTS CAN HELP TO BUILD RESILIENCE IF THERE'S A FLOOD OR OTHER CLIMATE-RELATED THINGS. SO THROUGH OUR INFRASTRUCTURE, THERE'S MANY THINGS THAT WE CAN HELP OUR COMMUNITY BE STRONGER.
00:48:56.806: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I THINK THESE A2ZERO GOALS THAT THEY ARE INTEGRATED FULLY THROUGH OUR VERTIC -- VERTICALLY IF THAT'S THE EXPRESSION THROUGH ALL CITY CONCERNS. SO WHENEVER YOU ARE DOING A PROJECT, OBVIOUSLY IT HAS TO EXCEED OUR STORM THE WHAT STANDARDS AND ALL OF -- STORMWATER STANDARDS AND ALL OF THAT AND BE AS GREEN AS POSSIBLE. PEOPLE HAVE ASKED ME WHAT IS THE D.D.'S MISSION. AND -- D.D.A.'S MISSION. AND THE REMAKING OF THE STREETS, IT'S VERY VISIBLE PROJECTS. AND SO I HAVE HAD FOLKS ASK ME AND THEY EXPRESSED A LOT OF INTEREST IN OTHER THINGS GOING ON IN DOWNTOWN. HOW CAN THEY BE PART OF THIS FIBER INSTALLATION PROJECT GOING ON IN THE DOWNTOWN AREA, WHERE ONE, TWO, THREE'S DIGGING UP -- THEY'VE GOT TO BE BACK AT SOME POINT TO POUR THAT CONCRETE THAT THESE SIDEWALKS BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN TEARING IT UP DOWN THERE. CAN YOU REFER ME TO A PLACE WHERE BUSINESS OWNERS AND PEOPLE WHO LIVE DOWNTOWN AND WORK DOWNTOWN, WHO CAN THEY TALK TO IF THEY WANT TO BE PART OF THESE KINDS OF PROJECTS? THEY WANT ACCESS TO THAT FIBER PROJECT, THEY WANT ACCESS TO THE GRANT WRITING ASSISTANCE OR TO MAKE SUGGESTS FOR THE D.D.A. AND HOW THEY FEEL WHAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO DO. WHO SHOULD THEY TALK TO?
00:50:15.218: >> I GUESS I WOULD SAY AS FAR AS LIKE THE 123.NET AND ALL THE FIBER WORK DOWNTOWN, WE SEE IT TOO AND SOMETIMES IT HAPPENS IN AREAS THAT WE HAVE LITERALLY JUST RECONSTRUCTED. SO THAT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT THE D.D.A. IS INVOLVED WITH.
00:50:31.033: >> Councilmember Hayner:  WHAT IS THAT PROJECT? I THOUGHT WE WERE EXPANDING A FIBER OPPORTUNITY THROUGH THE COMMUNITY?
00:50:39.142: >> City Admin. Crawford: MAURA, I BE ABLE TO. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, THE WORK YOU ARE SEEING NOW IS PRIVATE WORK BEING DONE FOR PRIVATE PURPOSES. THE PROJECT YOU ARE REFERRING TO WHIR PLANNING TO START CONSTRUCTION LATER THIS YEAR AND FLYNN WHO WOULD LIKE TO HAVE INVOLVEMENT WITH THAT AS FAR AS, YOU KNOW, GETTING ACCESS OR THING BEES LIKE THAT, CAN REACH OUT TO MR. SHUCHUCK.
00:51:06.035: >> Councilmember Hayner:  OH, OKAY. THANKS. I'VE HAD PEOPLE SAY, YOU CAN USE MY BUILDING IF YOU WANT TO RELAY WIRE OR WHATEVER. THEY WANT TO REALLY GROW THIS SORT OF COMMUNICATION INFRASTRUCTURE IN OUR DOWNTOWN AREA. I THOUGHT THAT -- THAT WAS MAYBE WHAT WAS HAPPENING ABOUT OUR VERY EYES. I WILL WRITE DOWN THE REST OF MY
00:51:27.156: >> City Admin. Crawford: IDEALLY , I WILL POINT OUT WITH THE ROLLOUT OF THE CONSTRUCTION, MAYBE YOU WILL SEE LESS OF THAT BECAUSE THERE WILL BE CAPACITY FOR OTHER PEOPLE TO USE OURS.
00:51:45.675: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER SONG.
00:51:48.477: >> Councilmember Song: SINCE THIS IS A BUDGET QUESTION, I WILL ASK A BUDGET-RELATED QUESTION. CAN YOU CLARIFY TORE ME, IS IT -- IS IT -- FOR ME, IS IT CORRECT -- IS MY UNDERSTANDING CORRECT THAT OUR DEBT SERVICE IS PAID FROM T.I.F. AND NOT REVENUE, NOT PERMIT REVENUE? AND THAT EVEN WITH THE PANDEMIC, THAT WAS -- I MEAN, OUR T.I.F. REVENUE IS FINE AND WILL INCREASE OVER TIME?
00:52:14.203: >> YES, OUR -- SO OUR DEBT SERVICE FOR OUR PARKING CONSTRUCTION IS MAINLY COMES OUT OF OUR PARKING FUND BUT WE DO CARRY SOME OF THAT IN OUR T.I.F. FUND AS WELL. FOR EXAMPLE, THE LIBRARY LANE PARKING STRUCTURE BECAUSE IT WAS TO SUPPORT DEVELOPMENT ON TOP, THAT DEBT IS SPLIT. I DON'T HAVE THE RATIO OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD BUT IT'S SPLIT BETWEEN T.I.F. AND PARKING. THE PROJECTIONS RIGHT NOW, WE DON'T ANTICIPATE HAVING ANY REDUCTIONS IN T. I. F., YOU KNOW, WE ARE CAPPED AT 3.5% A YEAR. SO WE CAN GO UP INCREMENTALLY AND WE DON'T ANTICIPATE ANY REDUCTIONS.
00:53:03.085: >> Councilmember Song: GREAT. THANKS. I HOPE YOU CAN KEEP RAKING IN THE AWARDS FOR THE WORK WITH THE BIKE LANE AND KEEPING FOLKS SAFE AND ENVISIONING A MORE VIBRANT DOWNTOWN. THANKS.
00:53:20.169: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
00:53:21.037: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU FOR THE SECOND OPPORTUNITY. I JUST HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT OUR CREDIT CARD FEES AND IT'S BEEN, YOU KNOW, BOTHERING ME FOR THE TWO OR THREE TIMES I HAVE GONE THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS AND HEARD ABOUT THE FEES THAT ARE ASSOCIATED. ARE WE RENEWING THAT CONTRACT ANY TIME SOON? IS THERE ANYTHING THAT'S CHANGED? BUT THE FEES ASSOCIATED WITH RUNNING THAT, I THINK, ARE ABOVE AVERAGE.
00:53:48.564: >> I HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT, I WILL HAVE TO CHECK WITH OUR PARKING SYSTEMS MANAGER. I DON'T KNOW OF ANY CHANGES BEING MADE.
00:53:55.271: >> I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT EITHER, BUT TIMING-WISE, BUT DO KEEP IN MINE THAT WHEREVER YOU SEE CREDIT CARD FEES, IT ALSO INCLUDES SOFTWARE. SO WHERE IT'S NOT JUST A MATTER OF SWIPING A CARD FOR A TRANSACTION, WE HAVE SOFTWARE AT THE METERS THAT WE ALSO PAY THROUGH THAT LINE ITEM. THAT'S ALL KIND OF COMBINED THROUGH ONE VENDOR. THE OTHER THING TO KEEP IN MIND IS THAT OUR TRANSACTIONS TEND TO BE SMALL AND NUMEROUS. WHICH MEANS WE INCUR HIGHER PERCENTAGES OF FEES THAN WOULD BE NORMAL FOR MOST RETAIL ESTABLISHMENTS. AND I THINK OUR LEVELS ARE AT ABOUT 5% OVERALL, INCLUDING THE SOFTWARE COSTS RIGHT NOW. SO THEY ARE HIGHER THAN WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THEM, ALWAYS, BUT I DON'T THINK THEY ARE OUT OF LINE WITH INDUSTRY STANDARDS.
00:54:52.561: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANKS FOR THE INFORMATION. IF IT'S AT ALL POSSIBLE, I WILL BRING THIS UP AGAIN, AND PUT IT IN WRITING. I THINK IF YOU SHOP THAT AROUND, WE CAN PROBABLY SAVE SOME MONEY THERE. THANK YOU.
00:55:06.976: >> Mayor Taylor: ANY OTHER QUESTIONS? THANKS TO THE GOOD PEOPLE AT THE D.D.A.
00:55:16.652: >> THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR TIME. WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT.
00:55:20.022: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
00:55:30.533: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
00:55:31.400: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WILL EMAIL IT TO TOM. IT'S A PROCEDURAL QUESTION ABOUT HOW A BUDGET IS FORMS. THANK YOU. I PUT MY HAND UP QUITE LATE. YOU WERE CORRECT, THERE WERE NO RAISED HANDS. THANKS.
00:55:41.310: >> Mayor Taylor: MM-HMM.
00:55:47.583: >> City Admin. Crawford: MAYOR, WOULD YOU LIKE TO INTRODUCE THE NEXT GROUP?
00:55:52.154: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. CRAWFORD.
00:55:52.822: >> City Admin. Crawford: TONIGHT WE HAVE A PRESENTATION ON THE ANN ARBOR YPSILANTI SMARTZONE. WE HAVE A REPRESENTATIVE FROM SPARK, BILL MAYER, AND WE HAVE MR. STEPHEN RAPUNDALO.
00:56:10.973: >> GOOD EVENING MAYOR AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE LOCAL DEVELOPMENT FINANCING AUTHORITY OTHERWISE KNOWN AS THE ANN ARBOR-YPSILANTI SMARTZONE. I THINK IF I'M CORRECT, THE LAST TIME WE WERE BEFORE THIS BODY WAS TWO YEARS AGO. AND SO CERTAINLY THERE HAVE BEEN CHANGES AROUND THE COUNCIL TABLE AND SO RECOGNIZING THAT WHAT I WANTED TO DO WAS GIVE A LITTLE BIT OF A BACKGROUND ABOUT THE SMART ZONES. IT'S TYPICALLY NOT AS WELL-KNOWN IN TERMS OF T.I. FIX INCREMENT FINANCING AUTHORITIES AS IS THE D.D.A. AND I THINK IT HAS SOME INTERESTING -- THERE'S SOME ASPECTS OF IT THAT REQUIRE I THINK A LITTLE UNDERSTANDING AS TO HOW THIS ALL WORKS. SO I'M GOING TO JUST SHARE MY SCREEN. OKAY. SO THE SMART ZONES, I THINK THEY ARE A LITTLE -- 21 OF THEM NOW, BACK WHEN THIS WAS CREATED IN 2000, I THINK THERE WAS OWN ABOUT 8 OR 9 FORMS OF WHICH ANN ARBOR WAS ONE AND I WILL DIVE INTO THE DETAILS HERE IN A SEC. BUT BASICALLY OVER TIME, OVER THE LAST 20 YEARS, THE NUMBER OF SMARTZONES HAS BASICALLY DOUBLED AND IN MANY CASES, IT ALSO INCLUDES, SO-CALLED SATELLITE ZONES THAT ARE AFFILIATED WITH SOME OF THE LARGER AND MORE ESTABLISHED SMART ZONES AND WE'LL HIGHLIGHT TOWARDS THE END OF MY PRESENTATION. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT THE LDFA IS LIKE THE D.D.A. THERE ARE'S SOME ENABLING LEGISLATION AND GOVERNING DOCUMENTS THAT GOVERN, YOU KNOW, HOW WE OPERATE, EVERYTHING FROM OBVISLY THE ENABLING LEGISLATION BUT THEN AGREEMENTS BETWEEN ANN ARBOR AND YPSILANTI, WITH THE LDFA AND WEAVE THE T.I.F. PLAN WITH THE STATE OF MICHIG AND THE MDLC THAT GOVERN WHAT THE TIP BOUNDARS CAN -- WHAT THE MONIECAN BE USEDOR OROT, AND THEN THE GOVERNED B THE BAWS.URSES. AND I OY MENON ALL O THIS CAUSE, IN FACT, OVER THE ARS, A NUMBER OF THESE IN TREATIES HAVE BEEN IOKED WITH ALLOCATIS ORUDGET RUESTSUDGET THAT WE HAVE HAD TO, YOU KNOW, DECLIN OR BAUSE THEY DID NOT MATCHR WE NOT IN LINE WIT A REGULATIONS.ESE GOVERNING SO IN TERMS OFNN ARBOR, WE RECEED STATUSACK I ', BUT ZONE TO -- THE OPERAON TO GET F THE GROUND. AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTA TO NOHAT THETATE FUNDS ARE DISTRIBUTEOCALLY. OTHER WORDS, THIS IS A TAX CAPTUREITHIN THE BOUARIES TH AREDENTICAL T THOSEF THE D.D.A., AND IN THE CE OF THE SMART ZON THEY ARE ONLY CAURED IN E ANN ARBOR SID NO CAPTU OURS IN YILANTI ANDHOSEUNDS CAN ONLY BE USED IN THE NO ANN ARBOR-YPSILANTI SERVICE AREAS. TO BE CLEAR, THE SMARTZONE IS FUNDED BY THE STATE OF MICHIGAN AND WITHOUT THE SMART ZONE MONIES, THESE WOULD NOT OTHERWISE BE DISTRIBUTED OR RECEIVED LOCALLY. AND DECISION, AND I WILL TALK ABOUT -- I WILL DETAIL WHAT THE PURPOSES OF THE FUNDS ARE FOR, BUT THEY CAN ONLY BE USED FOR THE PURPOSES AS DEFINED BY THE REGULATING DOCUMENTS AND THEY CANNOT BE USED FOR OTHER LOCAL PURPOSES OR PROGRAMS OR BUDGET LINES IN THE MUNICIPAL BUDGET. AND MY NEXT COMMENT BEARS REPEATING, BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN MISINFORMATION THAT HAS COME UP TIME AND TIME AGAIN OVER THE YEARS. WHILE I MAKE CLEAR THE TAX CAPTURE COMES FROM TAXES COMMITTED TO SCHOOLS, THEY ARE BY LAW -- I REPEAT BY LAW REPAID TO THE LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS BY THE STATE OF MICHIGAN SO THE ANN ARBOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS, FOR EXAMPLE, FUNDING REMAINS WHOLE. AND BASICALLY, THE STATE HAS THE FORMULA THAT IS APPLIED TO THE TAX INCREMENTAL VALUE WITHIN THE DISTRICT AND THOSE FUNDS ARE WHAT IS DISTRIBUTED TO THE SMARTZONE TO BE DEPLOYED. AND SO THE SMART ZONE OVER THE YEARS. I THINK A FEW YEARS INTO ITS LIFE CONTRACTED WITH ANN ARBOR SPARK AND, IN FACT, ITS PRECURSOR FOR TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES THAT ESSENTIALLY WOULD GO TOWARDS ASSISTING CATALYZING COMPANY FORMATION, AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF HIGH-TECH TECHNOLOGIES AND PRODUCTS AND SPECIFICALLY THOSE ARE APPLIED IN BUSINESS ACCELERATOR SERVICES TO THE COMPANIES, AND THIS IS IT COMES IN THE FORM OF INCUBATOR SPACE WHERE WE ARE TALKING 330 EAST LIBERTY, THERE'S SPACE FOR ABOUT 25 TENANTS. THERE'S ADDITIONAL SPACE IN THE TOP LEVEL FOR MORE LATER STAGE COMPANIES BUT WHO ARE NOT YET READY FOR PRIME TIME OR MARKET RATE CONDITIONS. SO IN ESSENCE, THE INCUBATE LORE PROVIDES SUB -- INCUBATE LORE PROVIDES -- THERE'S GENERAL ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED. THERE'S MEETING SPACE. AND THEN A SMALLER AREA IS IN YPSILANTI ON MICHIGAN AVE. IN ADDITION, WE CONTRACT WITH SPARK TO MANAGE THE ACCOUNTING OF ALL THE LDFA SERVICES AAS WELL AS TO MANAGE MARKETING AS IT PERTAINS ONLY TO SUPPORT THE LDFA-FUNDED PROGRAMS. SO OUR DOLLARS DO NOT GO TOWARDS OTHER ASPECTS OF SPARK'S MISSION OF BRANDING THE AREA. JUST TO DO A DEEPER DIVE IN TERMS OF THE BUSINESS ACCELERATOR SERVICES. SO ESSENTIALLY THESE ARE SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED TO EVERYBODY WHO IS CONTEMPLATING FORMING A COMPANY TO THOSE THAT -- WHO ARE, YOU KNOW, GROWING AND COMMERCIALIZING TECHNOLOGIES AND PRODUCTS TO' LOGICAL EXIT OR A SALE OR AN ACQUISITION BY SOMEBODY. AND SO OBVIOUSLY, THERE'S VARIOUS STAGES THAT TAKES TIME BUT, YOU KNOW, SO WE HAVE OFFERED OVER THE YEARS VARIOUS SO-CALLED PHASES OF ACCELERATOR SERVICES. IT BEGINS WITH A GENERAL INTAKE, MANY TIMES THE COMPANY HASN'T EVEN LEGALLY FORMED. YOU KNOW, THEIR BUSINESS PLANS, IF THEY HAVE ONE, OR THEIR CONCEPTS ARE REVIEWED AND, YOU KNOW, CONSULTED. AS -- THEN THEY PROCEED TO PHASE TWO, WHERE THERE'S MORE IN-DEPTH VALUATION THAT'S CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE THE CAPABILITY OF THE BUSINESS FOR -- TO EXECUTE ON ITS MILESTONES AND WHAT IT THINKS IT CAN DO. AND PHASE THREE, WHICH IS REALLY THE MAIN SET OF SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED TO COMPANIES. HERE, YOU KNOW, COMPANIES -- WE'RE TRYING TO HELP THEM WITH SOME, YOU KNOW, BUSINESS OPERATIONS IF YOU WILL THAT CAN BE SUPPORTING COSTS RELATED TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION, TO IN THE CASE OF LIFE SCIENCE COMPANIES, IT COULD BE REGULATORY CONSULTS, THINGS LIKE THAT. IN ADDITION, THE SPARK THROUGH ITS PROGRAMS PROVIDES VARIOUS EDUCATION, YOU KNOW, AT THE VERY, VERY EARLY STAGE, YOU KNOW, PRIOR TO PHASE ONE OR AT PHASE ONE, IT'S AN ENTREPRENEUR'S BOOT CAMP, MANY FOUNDERS DON'T HAVE A CLUE AS HOW TO START AND BUILD A COMPANY. THERE ARE MANY BUSINESS NETWNETWORKING EVENTS ACROSS MAY TECHNOLOGY AND INDUSTRY AREAS AND SO FORTH. IN ADDITION, THE DOLLARS ARE SPENT FOR EXECUTIVES AND RESIDENTS AND SO THESE ARE ENTREPRENEURS, SERIAL ENTREPRENEURS WHO HAVE BEEN THERE AND DONE THAT AND NOW IN A POSITION TO TEACH OTHERS, WHICH NOT ONLY BENEFITS THE COMPANY IN QUESTION WHO SEEKS THAT KIND OF SUPPORT AND EXPERTISE, BUT ARE ALSO ALLOWS THESE EXECUTIVING, THESE SERIAL ENTREPRENEURS TO TAKE IN THE COMMUNITY AND RETAIN THAT C. LEVEL EXPERTISE, WHICH IS REALLY QUITE FRANKLY QUITE HARD TO COME BY, AND THEY CAN DO THEIR MAGIC ALL OVER AGAIN. IN I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY OF THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS, DOLLARS HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED TOWARDS TALENT AND WORKFORCE, PRIMARILY IN THE FORM OF INTERNSHIPS AND MATCHING FUNDS FOR INTERNSHIPS, AS WELL AS FOR DIGITAL ENGAGEMENT CLINIC WHERE WE ARE ASSISTING COMPANIES IN THEIR DIGITAL MARKETING EFFORTS. OTHER INITIATIVES THAT THE DARYLS SUPPORT ARE, I THINK, HOPEFULLY THINGS THAT YOU HAVE HEARD ABOUT OR PERHAPS PARTICIPATED, THE MOBILITY AND THE SMART CITIES INITIATIVE, IF YOU HOPEFULLY SOME OF YOU HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO TO PARTICIPATE IN A2TECH360 WHICH HAS GROWN TREMENDOUSLY OVER THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS AND REALLY SHINES A SPOTLIGHT ON THE LOCAL TECHNOLOGY SORT OF ECOSYSTEM, WHICH HAS PERHAPS HIDES SOMEWHAT IN THE BACKGROUND ON A DAILY BASIS BUT IS THIS EVENT REALLY BRINGS IT OUT TO THE FOREFRONT AND REALLY ARE E FEELS HOW ROBUST AND BROAD IT IS IN ANN ARBOR-YPSILANTI. AND ALSO WE HAVE ADRIAN? TECUMSEH SMARTZONE RELATIONSHIP WITH ANN ARBOR SPARK. SO JUST A LITTLE BIT IN TERMS OF SOME METRICS AND STUFF. OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS, IF ONE WAS TO TAKE THE SO-CALLED BUSINESS ACCELERATOR SERVICE, THE FUNS TO THE ACSELLERROR SERVICE, PARTICULARLY THE PHASE THREE, ALONG WITH THE TALENT ALLOCATIONS, THAT REPRESENTS ABOUT 6.15 MILLION. AND IF ONE DOES THE MATH, IT WORKS OUT THAT WE'RE LEVERAGE ABOUT 127 FOR EVERY DOLLAR SPENT AND THAT'S NOT COUNTING ACQUISITIONS AND SO IF THE COMPANY WAS PURCHASED FOR X. NUMBER OF DOLLARS, WE ARE NOT COUNTING THOSE BUT JUST THE WILL DIRECT ALLOCATION OF THE LDFA DOLLARS IS RETURNING 127 FOR EACH DOLLAR. PRETTY IMPRESSIVE. OVER THAT PERIOD OF TIME, THE LDFA VIA WITH SPARK, THEY REPRESENT ABOUT 2,000 TECH SECTOR JOBS WHICH HAS BEEN AN INCREASE OF 1,000FTEs OVER WHAT WAS THERE TO BEGIN WITH. THIS GIVES YOU A FLAVOR FOR COMPANY SERVED YEAR OVER YEAR. SO THERE CERTAINLY HAS BEEN A GOOD APPETITE FOR THE SERVICES, EVEN DURING THE PANDEMIC THAT REALLY DIDN'T -- DIDN'T SLOW THINGS DOWN TOO MUCH. AND THIS NEXT SLIDE KIND OF GIVES YOU A FLAVOR FOR THE ABILITY OF THE DOLLARS BEING SPENT TO TRANSLATE INTO COMPANY RETENTION. SO YOU CAN SEE THAT A LITTLE OVER HALF OF THE COMPANIES THAT HAVE BEEN SERVED CONTINUE TO RESIDE WITHIN THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. 6% ARE OVER IN YPSILANTI. NOW YOU KNOW, THIS IS A RISKY -- A RISKY -- WILL, LITERALLY BUSINESS, INDUSTRYO BE IN. AN SO IT'S NOT UNCOMMON TO SEE, YOU KNOW, THE 15, 2 OR MORE OF BUSINESSES N SVIVE OVER A AND THEN LTLY, THERE ABOUT AN 18% OF THE COMPANI THAT HAVE BN SERVED WHO STARTED OUT WITHIN THE SERVICE AREA, BUT,N FACT, HAVE NOW MOVED OUTSIDE. MANY STILL IN THENN ARBOR AR, BUTUST NOT I THE BOUNDARIES OTHE T.I.F. AND THE T.I.F. SERVI ARE THISIVES Y A SENSEF HOW CH MONEYHESE COMPANI SO YOUNOW, A LITTLEVER VENTURE CAPITALRAISEDHROUGH AN THEN ALL THETHER ASSOCIATEDOURCES OFUNDING. AND, YOU KW, THIS IS HELD AS A PROMPTER AOSS THE COUNT. THE MORYOUAN RAI, YOUG HUBS, KNOW, PEOPLEAVE T FLAG AND IT'S A -- IT'S AN IICATOR OF W WLN ENTPRENEURIAL ECOSYSM IS TIVING. AND OIOUSLY THIS EBBS A OWS AND SO TS IS AN IMPORTAN METRIC BYHICH CERTNLY COMPANI LK AT LOLITIES, WHETH IT'S BECAUSE THAT WHERE THEY WAN TO START IS ANMPORTANT METC THAT THEHIS LDFA TRACKS. I'M GETTING A LITTLE AHEAD OF MYSELF. SOME FISCAL YEAR 2020 METRICS. SO 148 COUNTRIES RECEIVED THOSE SERVICES. IT'S TRANSLATED INTO ABOUT 138 NEW JOBS 23 OF THOSE COMPANIES UTILIZED THE BOOT CAMP. 95 WERE TENANT AT THE DOWNTOWN INCUBATOR. AND THERE WAS ABOUT ALMOST 100 EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS AND EVENTS HOSTED SO, YOU KNOW, PRETTY ENGAGED TYPE OF COMMUNITY. SOME -- THIS GIVES YOU A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES OF SUCCESS STORIES. TWO COMPANIES MAY MOBILITY AND ADADAPTED WERE VERY SUCCESSFUL. THEY BOTH STARTED IN THE EARLY STAGES OF RECEIVING SERVICES FROM THE LDFA THROUGH SPARK AND HAVE GONE ON TO RAISE NOT ONLY A LOT OF VENTURE CAPITAL, AND HAVE GROWN THEIR BUSINESSES AND WORKFORCE AND HAVE STAYED AROUND HERE, WHERE THOSE INCOMES AND REVENUES HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED INTO THE LOCAL ECONOMY. I JUST WANTED TO TOUCH ON SPECIFICALLY WHAT THE ALLOWABLE ACTIVITIES ARE WITHIN THE SMART ZONE. I HAVE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE ACCELERATOR SERVICES AND THINGS LIKE THAT. BUT THEY GO TOWARDS THINGS LIKE ENTREPRENEURIAL TRAINING, LIKE I SAID THE BOOT CAMP. THE EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT AND COACHING, MENTORING AND COACHING, ASSISTANCE WITH WRITING GRANTS FOR FEDERAL SUPPORT, LIKE THE SMALL BUSINESS INNOVATION RESEARCH GRANTS WHICH ARE A BIG WAY THAT MANY COMPANIES LAUNCH THEIR -- OR CONDUCT THEIR PROOF OF CONCEPT AND TAKE THEIR FIRST STEPS INTO COMMERCIALIZATION. IT GOES TOWARDS INCUBATOR AND WET LAB AND ACCELERATOR SPACES AND SHARED SERVICES AND THINGS LIKE THAT. IT CAN ALSO BE USED FOR THE CREATION OF TECHNOLOGY PARKS AS LONG AS THEY ARE INSIDE THE SMART ZONE, AND A GOOD EXAMPLE OF UNFORTUNATELY WHERE THAT DOESN'T ASUPPLY, BUT WE WISH IT DID, I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY OF YOU ARE AWARE OF THE -- IT'S CALLED MI-HQ, WHICH IS A -- THEY TOOK THE OLD PAUL GELMAN SITE AND REPURPOSED IT AS A LIFE SCIENCES INCUBATOR. I FORGET HOW MANY COMPANIES ARE HOUSED THERE, BUT IT IS FULL, BUT UNFORTUNATELY, IT LITERALLY IS ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE BOUNDARY AND SO THE LDFA DOLLARS, WHILE IT SUPPORTS THIS KIND OF ACTIVITY, CANNOT, INCOMEINFACT, BE DEPLOYED THERE. SO SOME STRICT RULES. SO LET'S DIVE INTO SOME NUMBERS. SO THIS GIVES YOU A SENSE OF THE TRA DIRECTORY OF THE T.I.F. CAPTURE SINCE THE INCESTION OF THE SMART ZONE. OBVIOUSLY, YOU KNOW, IT WAS A TRAUMATIC UPTICK ALMOST TEN ERR YEARS AGO AND WE HAVE BUILT THE SET OF SERVICES, RATHER DELIBERATELY AND SYSTEMICALLY AS REVENUE HAS PERMITTED. I SUPPOSE I HAVE THE DUBIOUS HONOR OF, I BELIEVE, BEING THE LONGEST SERVING MEMBER OF THE LDFA BOARD, MOSTLY BECAUSE OF MY TENURE ON CITY COUNCIL, BUT WHAT IT OFFERED ME WAS THE ABILITY TO BE THERE, I THINK I JOINED IN '05, TO WATCH THIS NAYSENT IDEA OF BEING THE SMARTPHONE REALLY GROW TO BEING, I THINK, THE GOLD STANDARD IN THE STATE, AND ITS ABILITY TO SUPPORT COMPANY FORMATION AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP, AND AS A RESULT OF THAT, BECOME QUITE AN ECONOMIC DRIVER IN THE HIGH-TECH SPACE HERE LOCALLY. OKAY. MOVING A LITTLE BUILT MORE TO THE BUDGET SIDE. THIS KIND OF BEGINS TO GIVE YOU A FLAVOR OF WHAT KIND OF DOLLARS THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. SO WE'RE -- AT THE MOMENT, THE FISCAL YEAR '21, WE ARE TARGETING $4.6 MILLION. WE RECEIVED A FEW PENNIES BACK ON A PRIOR ACTIVITY WHICH WAS MICROLOANS WHICH WOULD MAKE 10,000, 20,000, $15,000 LOANS TO COMPANIES, AND THEY -- OF COURSE THE INTENT IS THAT THESE COMPANIES WOULD PAY US BACK. AND SO THOSE DOLLARS THAT ARE SHOWN THERE ARE, IN FACT, THOSE THAT HAVE DONE SO. AND THEN WE DO GET SOME INVESTMENT INCOME FROM THE MONEY EARNED OFF THE FUND BALANCE. AND THERE WE HAVE THE TOTAL REVENUES THAT WE GET TO WORK WITH. THE NEXT THING IS BASICALLY THE BUDGET THAT YOU GET TO SEE EVERY YEAR. WE WILL BE COMING TO YOU WITH THE NEXT ONE HERE, I THINK WE ARE GOING TO BE APPROVING OURS IF NOT THIS MEETING, THEN THE MEETING IN APRIL, BUT THIS KIND OF BREAKS OUT TO THE LEVEL OF SUPPOSESPECIFICITY. SO AT THE TOP, YOU SEE, YOU KNOW, THERE'S SES -- IT COB ASSUMES A LARGE PART OF THE FUNDS. AS A MENTIONED, THE MICROLOAN PROGRAM, THAT DOES NOT THAT WAS NOT PERMITTED WHEN THE SMART ZONE WAS REAUTHORIZED IN 2018 FOR AN ADDITIONAL 15-YEAR PERIOD. AND THEN YOU SEE SOME OF THE ENTREPRENEURIAL AND EDUCATION PROGRAM LINE ITEMS PARTICULARLY THE DOLLARS SPENT TOWARDS INTERNSHIP AND TALENT TRAINING. WE HAVE ALSO BROKEN OUT WHAT IS BEING ALLOCATED OVER TO IPLY SANDTY. AS I SAID -- YPSILANTI. THERE'S NO TAX CAPTURE IN YPSILANTI BUT IN THE NEW 15-YEAR REAUTHORIZATION, 10% OF OVERAIM T.I.F. CAPTURE IS NOW -- IT HAS TO BE ALLOCATED OVER TO YPSILANTI AND SO THOSE NUMBERS REFLECT THAT DISBURSEMENT AND USE. AND THEN LASTLY, THERE ARE SPARK INDIRECT SERVICES AND IN THE NEXT SLIDE, THIS REFLECTS SOME MAJOR STRATEGIC EXPENDITURES. A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO, WE DECIDED TO ASK FOR OR SOLICIT NEW IDEAS FOR SERVICES OR RESOURCES THAT THE LDFA COULD -- COULD FUND AND WE HAVE SET ASIDE 400,000 FOR THAT. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS DONE A PEER-REVIEWED BASIS WITH SOME SPECIFIC CRITERIA IN SCORING AND SO FORTH. BUT THE BIGGEST TICKET ITEM THAT I THINK THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY FUNDING IS THE TECH PARK FIBER GRANT. FOR YEARS, WE WERE UNABLE -- WE DIDN'T HAVE THE TAX CAPTURE TO SUPPORT SOMETHING LIKE THIS. AND CERTAINLY, WE ACCUMULATED A FUND BALANCE, SHOW, AND NOW WE ARE IN A POSITION WHERE THAT FUND BALANCE IS BEING DEDICATED TOWARDS VERY BIG CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECT. AND THEN LASTLY, WHAT YOU SEE HERE IS THE INDIRECT SERVICES THAT THE LDFA PAYS THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR, FOR ITS SUPPORT BOTH LEGAL AND ADMIN AND SO FORTH. AND THEN AT THE BOTTOM, YOU SEE THE FUND BALANCE THAT HAJJLY WILL BE -- THAT LARGELY WILL BE UTILIZED DUE TO THE TECH PARK FIBER GRANT OVER THE NEXT YEAR OR TWO. THIS IS WHO SERVES ON THE BOARD CURRENTLY BY -- BY REGULATION, IT'S MADE UP OF NINE MEMBERS AND THIS IS FIVE FROM THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR, AND IT TWO TO YPSILANTI AND ONE TO REPRESENT WASHTENAW COUNTY AND ONE TO REPRESENT THE WASHTENAW COMMUNITY COLLEGE. THAT IS FROM THE ENABLING LEGISLATION. AND SO THESE ARE THE MEMBERS I SHOULD POINT OUT THAT ANDY LeBARR WE ARE SEEING A SWITCH IN REPRESENTATION. ANDY'S TERM IS ENDING AND JASON MORGAN WILL BE JOINING US AT THE NEXT MEETING. AND THEN WE REPRESENTATIVES FROM BOTH THE CITIES, BILL MAYER WHO IS ON THIS CALL SERVES EX OFFICIO AND THEN WE HAVE A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE MICHIGAN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CORRATION WHO, OF COURSE IS THE SOURCE OF THE FUNDING AND IN REALITY, SITS AS THE A ARBITOR AS FAR AS WHAT CAN AND CANNOT BE DONE WITH THE FUNDS THAT WE RECEIVE. THIS JUST GIVESOU NAVOR ABOUT -- I WANT TO SAY -- A FLAVOR ABOUT THREE OR FOUR YEA AGOOW. THEDFA CONDUCTED ITS FIRST EVER STRATEGIC PN IN WHICH IT WANTED TOOCUS. THOSE INDATED IN RED ARE THO HIGHER PRIORY AND INTESTS ANYOU WILL NOT IN THE SOND COLUMN, THEIGH-TECH COUNTRY FRIEND INFRASTCTURE, THE VERY FIRST BULLET, ASSIST IN THE AND AS I INDICAT WE HAV BEEN ABLEOAKE FUNDS AND ALY TH IN THAT REGARD. AND SO I THI AS W-- AS THE T.I.F. CTUREROWS, WE WIL B CARELLY TRYINGO DETERMINE WHERE FUN CANEST B DEPLOYED TO ARESS SOMEF TSE PRIORITI TT, YOU KW, ARE IN SYNC, I THINK I SOME RESPECTS WIT WHAT T CITY OF NRBOR -- AND THE CITY OF YPSILANT ARE TRYING TOO ARE TOHE LONGER TERM. ANDHINK THAT'S -- TT CONCLUS MY PRESEATION.
01:24:18.392: >> May Taylor: EXCLENT AND ANK YOU. ARE TRE ANY QUESTNS FROM COCIL? COUNCILMEMBE RAMWI.
01:24:24.932: >> Councilmemberamlawi: THANK YOU, MAY. WANTED TO SAY I APPREATE DR. ARDR. A  RAPUNDALO'S PRESEND TIME ON THE BOARD, AND SEE YOU ON THURSDAY.
01:24:49.156: >> SEE YOU ON THURSDAY.
01:24:49.857: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I ALSO WANT TO SAY HELLO, AND COULD YOU ELABORATE ON THE FIBER PROJECT? I SEE YOU HAVE $6 MILLION COMMITTED OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS. AND WHAT IS THE EXTENT OF THE AREA WHERE WE ARE GETTING FIBER.
01:25:05.139: >> WELL, I WILL DEFER TO TOM ON THAT ONE. HE WAS -- YEARS AGO, HE REALLY WAS THE CATALYST FOR THIS AND WHEN, YOU KNOW, FINAL -- LIKE I SAID, ONCE WE HAD AT LEAST ENOUGH MONEY TO KIND OF BEGIN TO PUT A DOWNPAYMENT ON THIS, WE DID SO BUT TOM REALLY HAS BEEN THE BRAIN CHILD L BEHIND THIS. TOM?
01:25:31.498: >> City Admin. Crawford: IF I COULD JUST CLARIFY, IT LOOKS LIKE $6 MILLION, BUT ACTUALLY THE $1.5 MILLION IS DOUBLE COUNTED WHEN YOU DO THAT, SO IT'S $4.5 MILLION IS IN THE BUDGET, AND THAT IS -- THAT WOULD COVER AN UNDERGROUND FIBER NETWORK THROUGHOUT THE D.D.A. THAT WOULD BE ACCESSIBLE TO EACH OF THE FACILITIES. IT DOES NOT GO TO THE UNIVERSITY, JUST THE PRIVATE PROPERTIES. THE STRUCTURE IS DESIGNED TO BE FLEXIBLE SO THAT IT WOULD ENABLE CONNECTIONS BY PARTIES VERY EASILY SO, YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT WHETHER IT'S A SENSOR OR THINGS, WHATEVER THEY WOULD USE IN A SMART CITY, IT WOULD BE PRETTY EASILY IMPLEMENTED AND IT'S IN AN EFFORT TO SUPPORT AN INNOVATION ZONE TYPE OF TECHNOLOGY.
01:26:27.888: >> Councilmember Griswold: OKAY. GREAT. THANKS.
01:26:32.993: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS.
01:26:35.796: >> Councilmember Briggs: THANKS. MINE IS FAIRLY SIMILAR TO COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD'S QUESTION, JUST TO EXPAND A LITTLE BIT ON THAT. SO SINCE THIS LAST YEAR HAS SHOWN US HOW MUCH THERE HAS BEEN A RETURN TO WORKING AT HOME, AND SOME COMPANIES MAY BE BEGINNING TO THINK ABOUT DOING THAT MORE AND MORE, IS THERE CONSIDERATION OF HOW WE WILL MIGHT BE ABLE TO EXPAND UPON THE INNOVATION ZONE AND WITH FIBER THROUGHOUT OUR COMMUNITY AND THEN THE SECOND QUESTION WELL, I WILL GO -- I HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION.
01:27:09.129: >> City Admin. Crawford: AND TO CLARIFY ON THAT, THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT THE CITY IS PUTTING IN IS OPEN TO OTHER PARTIES TO USE. SO IT'S INTENDED TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF DIGGING THAT IS OCCURRING. BUT ALSO UTILIZE THE SPACE AND THE ASSETS MOST EFFECTIVELY. SO WITHIN THAT ZONE, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE COULD TALK TO MR. SHUCHUCK AND WE COULD GO FROM THERE. YOU KNOW THE FUNDING FOR -- FROM THE LDFA FOR THIS TYPE OF THING HAS REACHED ITS MAXIMUM POTENTIAL THAT THE LDFA FUNDS HAVE. WE HAD SOME CONVERSATIONS WITH THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS ABOUT CONNECTING THEIR FACILITIES. THE CITY HAS IN ADDITION TO THIS A RING IN THE CITY. IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT KIND OF CONCEPTUALLY, AND THAT RING WAS DESIGNED TO BE NEAR SCHOOLS. AND YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT THAT MIGHT BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR FURTHER DEVELOPMENT IN THE FUTURE BUT WE DON'T HAVE ANY PLANS AT THIS TIME. I WAS GOING TO ADD, THAT'S THE RUB, THAT WHILE THERE ARE CERTAINLY THINGS WHETHER IT BE CAPITAL INFRASTRUCTURE OR SERVICES, THAT WE WOULD DEARLY LOVE TO DEPLOY, BEYOND THE ACTUAL T.I.F. DISTRICT, WE ARE HAMP ERRED BY NOT BEING ABLE TO DO SO, AND THE FIBER PROJECT IS A GOOD EXAMPLE. YOU KNOW, LINKING ANN ARBOR -- WELL, EVEN EXTENDING IT BEYOND THE T.I.F. DISTRICT IN ANN ARBOR, MUCH LESS EXPANDING IT AND CONNECTING THE TWO PARTS OF THE SMART ZONE, I.E., ANN ARBOR TO YPSILANTI IS VERY PROBLEMATIC. WE CERTAINLY TRIED. BUT WE'RE NOT SUCCESSFUL IN CONVINCING THE POWERS TO BE IN LANSING THAT -- THAT THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT LDFA DOLLARS WERE ELIGIBLE FOR.
01:29:09.783: >> City Admin. Crawford: AND IT'S INSTITUTIONAL BUILD AND IT'S GOVERNMENT AND RELATED ENTITIES THAT'S PRIMARY FOCUS BUT IT WAS DESIGNED TO BE A COMMUNITY ASSET AND THE CITY IS PURSUING IS PURSUING A GRANT AND SPARK, I SHOULD SAY IN P PARTNERSHIP WITH THEM AND OTHERS ARE PURSUING AN E.D.A. GRANT AT THIS TIME TO SEE IF WE CAN CONNECT THE ANN ARBOR FACILITY TO -- TO S YPSILANTI AND THEN TE AMERICA SENATE FORMER BUILDING. IF THAT HAPPENS, IF THE GRANT IS AWARDED. THAT WOULD BE -- I THINK THAT COMES BACK TO COUNCIL, BECAUSE WE WOULD BE ADMINISTERING THE BILL OF THAT GRANT AND IT WOULD BE AN ASSET THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO HELP KIND OF REGIONALLY, BUT REALLY, CONNECT THE TECHNOLOGY CORRIDOR.
01:30:05.472: >> Councilmember Briggs: THAT'S GREAT AND EXCITING TO SEE THIS MOVING FORWARD. THE OTHER QUESTION I HAD WAS YOU MENTIONED THAT VERY MANIURE CAPITAL IS A MET -- VENTURE CAPITAL IS A METRIC USED TO DETERMINE SUCCESS. I WAS WONDERING HOW -- IS THAT -- -- HOW DOES THAT COMPARE TO OTHER SUCCESSFUL ZONES WHETHER IT'S IN THE STATE OR IN OTHER PARTS THE COUNTRY?
01:30:38.138: >> I WILL TURN THAT OVER TO BILL. SPARK HAS CERTAINLY BENCHMARKED OTHER REGIONS AND CERTAINLY WITH REGARDS TO VENTURE CAPITAL BUT OTHER METRICS TOO. BILL?
01:30:50.517: >> SURE. AND HELLO, EVERYONE, BILL MAYER. AND LOOKING AT ANN ARBOR AS BEING ANN ARBOR, IT IS SOMETIMES HARD TO BENCHMARK AGAINST OTHER COMMUNITIES, YOU KNOW, WE TRY AVOID DOING DIRECT COMPARISONS TO SAN FRANCISCO OR BOSTON JUST COMPARED TO THE SCALE. WHEN YOU LOOK AT ANN ARBOR, WE USE THE TERM PUNCH ABOVE OUR WEIGHT FOR THE CAPITAL RAISED AND BY CAPITAL RAISED WHAT WE REFER TO IS AT THE EARLIEST STAGE, THE SBIR FUNDING FOR FUNDAMENTAL SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND ANGEL INVESTMENT, VENTURE INVESTMENTS, BUT WE DON'T INCLUDE THINGS LIKE FOUNDER CAPITAL AND BUSINESS PLAN WINNINGS. THE MIDWEST H HAS UNDERPERFORMED THE COASTS BUT WE HAVE SEEN THAT PICK UP IN THE LAST FIVE TO TEN YEARS AND IT'S PICKED UP IN TWO WAYS. NUMBER ONE SHEER VOLUME OF CAPITAL AND HAVING COASTAL INVESTORS BEING COMFORTABLE IN INVESTING IN MIDWEST BUSINESS AS WELL AS WHAT USED TO BE A PROBLEM MAYBE 15 YEARS AGO WHERE A COMPANY WOULD GET VENTURE INVESTMENT AND THEN LEAVE THE AREA. WE HAVE SEEN THE VENTURE INVESTORS BEING COMFORTABLE LEAVING INVESTMENTS IN PLACE. WHEN YOU LOOK AT ARE A NUMBER LIKE THAT, YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE LARGE DEALS INSIDE OF THERE, BUT THERE ARE ALSO A LOT OF SMALLER DEALS. AND SO ONE OF THE NICE THINGS ABOUT THE MIDWEST IS OUR COMPANIES TEND TO DO MORE WITH LESS, SO, YOU KNOW, SOMEONE RAISING $5 MILLION IN MICHIGAN AS COULD COMPARED TO ONE OF THE COASTS, IT TENDS TO GO FURTHER. SO THAT'S ALWAYS HISTORICALLY A METRIC WE TRACK. BECAUSE IF THEY ARE ABLE TO GAIN EARLY TRACTION, CUSTOMERS, GROWTH, BUT THEN THEY CAN'T ACCESS GROWTH CAPITAL TO TAKE A COMPANY TO A LEVEL THAT IT IS APPROPRIATE OR THAT IT REALLY HAS A MAJOR ECONOMIC IMPACT ON THE COMMUNITY, THAT'S A PROBLEM AND THEY WILL LEAVE IF THEY CAN'T FIND THAT CAPITAL. SO WE HAVEN'T BEEN OBSERVING THAT. WE HAVE BEEN SEEING COMPANIES NOT ONLY COMMIT TO STAYING IN ANN ARBOR, POST FUNDING EVENT, BUT WE HAVE ACTUALLY SEEN COMPANIES -- YOU MAY HAVE SEEN K.L.A. AS AN EXAMPLE THAT'S BUILDING HEADQUARTERS UP ONYXON ROAD THAT ARE CHOOSING TO OPEN LOCATIONS HERE BECAUSE OF WHAT ANN ARBOR HAS TO OFFER. SO I MEAN I THINK FOR ANN ARBOR, WE ARE VERY GOOD. WHEN YOU START TO TRY AND COMPARE US TO OTHER COMMUNITIES IT CAN GET A LITTLE PROBLEMATIC, BUT WHAT STEVE REFERENCED IN TERMS OF OUR BENCHMARKING REPORT THAT WAS JUST PUBLISHED THAT TRIES -- IT GIVES IT OUR BEST TRY TO COMPARE EVERYTHING FROM CAPITAL RAISED TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO WORKFORCE ISSUES ACROSS THE BOARD. DID THAT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION?
01:33:48.295: >> Councilmember Briggs: IT DID, THANK YOU.
01:33:49.996: >> Mayor Taylor: MY APOLOGIES. COUNCILMEMBER SONG. OF.
01:33:53.734: >> Councilmember Song: HI, EVERYONE. I FEEL LIKE I -- THIS IS A FAMILIAR CONVERSATION. [ LAUGHTER ]
01:34:03.577: >> YOU KNOW A THING OR TWO ABOUT THAT.
01:34:06.413: >> Councilmember Song: I HEAR WHISPERS. I WAS WONDERING IS THERE -- YOU KNOW, EQUITY INCLUSION IS PART OF OUR STRATEGIC PLAN. WHEN YOU LOOK AT YOUR BUDGETING IS, THAT SOMETHING -- IS THAT PART OF YOUR OWN STRATEGIC PLAN AND HOW YOU HAVE -- I MEAN, IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHERE WE CAN HAVE MORE DIVERSE ENTREPRENEURS IN TOWN. WHEN I LOOK AT OTHER CITIES HOW THEY FOCUSED, LIKE SPECIFICALLY FOCUSED ON UNDERREPRESENTED COMMUNITIES AND MAKING SURE THEY HAVE ACCESS TO CAPITAL, IS THAT SUPPORTING THE PLAN, AND IF NOT, WHY NOT?
01:34:51.925: >> YES, THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION. SO WE DO HAVE A MEMBER OF OUR STAFF THAT IS OUR D.E.I. LEAD. HER NAME IS ANN PARTINGTON. SHE RUNS OUR SPARK EAST FACILITY AS WELL AS THE D.I. INITIATIV AT SPARK. AND A BIG PART OF WHAT WE TRY SUPPORTING PLAYER IN TERMS OFD A ENGAGING WITH OTHER ENTITIES THAT ARE FOCUSED ON THE  E.I., WHETHE THAT'S THROUGH THE UNIVERSITY OR REGIONAL GROUPS, IN DETROIT OR ANYWHERE ELSE. YOU KNOW,E TRY TO SORT OF BE INVOLVED ON A VYROAD REGIONAL LEVEL WITH THOSE INITIATIVES. AND WE TRY T-- FOR EXAMPLE,E JUST DID -- THERE'S A GRANT THAT CAME UP AND WE JUST RAN REPORT. WE IDENTIFIED THAT WITN THE START-UPS TT WERE FOUED B HAPPY T SEE WHICH WE ARE AND SO Y KNOW, THERE TWO SIDE OF IT,UMBER ONE, THE IDEA OFOU HE A BETTE STAFF AND BETTER WORKFOR WHE YOU E D.E.O.s AS STREGY EMBEDD IN YOUR BUSINESS AND IT SO YOU KNOW, WE HAVE SE PEOPLE ENTER MARKETSND HE OPPOUNITIES, FORXAMPLE, THE AUTONDUSTRY HAS SOME RELATORY EMENTS AROUN ITS --OU KNOW,T'S SORT OF VENDORS D OTHER BUSESS THAT THEY DO, BAUSE THE HAVE THEIR OWN D.E.I. GOALS. SO WE TRY TO TAKE THE POSITIO OFRAINING, ECATION, AND, YOU KNOW, JT MAKING SURE THAT IT'SART OF TH COERSATION. WE DO HE TO BE CARUL BECAUSE AT SPARK WE ARE OPEN AND INUSIVE. THE ENTPRENEURS THA CE US TO WILLELP THEMN EVERY WAY WE CAN T WE DEFINELY WEAVE A MESSAGE OF T BENEFIT OF D.E.I. WN WE ARE TALKI TO OUR COMNIES JUSTS IORTANT AS DOING CUSMERISCOVERY A BUILDI A STRONG CPANY CULTUR WE REALLY TRY T REFORCE THAESGE AND ANN PARTGTON WHO DS ALL OF OUR PROGMMING -- WELL, NOT ALL OF OUR PROGRAMMING BUT IS OUR LEAD IN OUR PROGRAMMING REALLY DOES A NICE JOB OF THAT, AT LEAST IN MY PERSONAL OPINION. IT'S AN INTERESTING SPACE THAT'S VERY MUCH IN MOTION. SO IT'S BEEN ENJOYABLE TO SEE HOW THAT'S GAINED SO MUCH TRACTION IN THE LAST FIVE OR SO YEARS.
01:37:19.606: >> Councilmember Song: BECAUSE WE NEED TO MAKE UP FOR 10 YEARS OR 15 YEARS BEFORE THAT.
01:37:24.644: >> KEEP GOING. LONGER THAN THAT.
01:37:26.947: >> Councilmember Song: YES, IT'S BEEN A WHILE. GREAT. WELL, THANK YOU. THAT'S VERY HELPFUL.
01:37:30.984: >> THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION. I APPRECIATE IT.
01:37:35.355: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER QUESTIONS? DR. RAPUNDALO, AND MR. MAYER, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
01:37:48.034: >> OF COURSE, THANK YOU.
01:37:50.236: >> Mayor Taylor: WE NOW COME TO PUBLIC COMMENT GENERAL TIME. IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO SPEAK TO COUNCIL AND THE COMMUNITY ABOUT MATTERS OF MUNICIPAL INTEREST. TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT GENERAL TIME, PLEASE ENTER THE NUMBER ON YOUR SCREEN, 877-853-5247. ONCE YOU ARE CONNECTED PLEASE ENTER MEETING I.D.94212732148. ONCE YOU ARE CONNECTED, PLEASE ENTER STAR 9, STAR 9 TO INDICATE THAT Y YOU WISH TO SPEAK. ONCE YOU ARE CONNECTED YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES IN WHICH TO SPEAK. THE CLERK WILL NOTIFY YOU WHEN YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS REMAINING, PLEASE CONCLUDE YOUR REMARKS AND CEDE THE FLOOR. IS THERE ANYONE WOULD WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC -- WOULD WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT.
01:38:42.088: >> CALLER 965, DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT?
01:38:43.556: >> I DO. HI, THIS IS JOE SPALDING. I WAS APPROACHED ONCE AGAIN BY A REPORTER FROM A MAJOR PAPER LAST WEEK ASKING FOR QUOTES ABOUT TIRED LIES BY MEMBERS OF COUNCIL TRYING TO CHILL MY FREE SPEECH WITH ABSURD DISTRACTIONS. YOU DON'T THINK THAT ANN ARBOR SHOULD HAVE TO PULL ITS WEIGHT ON CLIMATE CHANGE AND ENDING SEGREGATION WILL NOT GO THE WAY YOU HOPE IT DOES. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI HAD A RACIAL STEREOTYPE FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES. THIS IS GROW G GROTESQUE. YOU ARE NOT BLACK. YOU DON'T GET TO USE THE PAIN OF BLACK PEOPLE AS A SHIELD AGAINST ACCOUNTABILITY. I KEEP DETAILED RECORDS. YOU CAN BET YOUR RESTAURANT AND ANY REPORTER ASKING ME FOR A QUOTE GETS SCREEN CO CAPS AND TY WILL NOT COMMIT LIBEL FOR A COMPANY THAT IS TRYING TO THE GAS THEY ARE THROWING ON THE HOUSING CRISIS. DISCREDITS HIMSELF IN THE VIEW OF REPORTER ENAND HE DISCORRECTS THE CITY COUNCIL WHEN HE DOES THIS. HE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE. I SPEAK IN FRONT OF DOZENS OF COUNCILS ALL OVER, ONLY IN ANN ARBOR HAVE COUNCILMEMBERS CONSPIRED TO GET ME FIRED, DISCORRECTED, SILENCED, SUED AND EVEN ARRESTED. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, I HAVE A VER ITABLE BUFFET TO FEED MEMBERS OF THE PRESS. I'M NOT BEING PAID TO HOLD YOU ACCOUNTABLE. IT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. I'M NOT BEING PAID TO FIGHT SEGREGATION EVERYWHERE I FIND IT, I'M COMPELLED. AND I DO IT BECAUSE I'M GOOD AT IT. TELLING REPORTERS I AM PAID IS DEFAMATION, DOING IT TOGETHER IS CIVIL CONSPIRACY. THE MICHIGAN CONSTITUTION BEGINS WITH ALL POLITICAL POWERS INHERENT IN THE PEOPLE, THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR DERIVES AUTHORITY FROM THE MICHIGAN CONSTITUTION, WHICH IN TURN IS EMPOWERED BY THE CONSTITUTION, AND MICHIGANANDERS AND YOU NEED TO HOLD YOURSELVES LIKE U.S. SENATORS. WHEN IT COMES TO ME LET ME MAKE THE VALUABLE PROFESSIONAL ADVICE EXTREMELY CLEAR. WHEN YOU SPEAK TO THE PRESS, STICK TO THE ISSUES AND KEEP MY NAME OUT OF YOUR MOUTHS. THANK YOU.
01:40:52.252: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT?
01:41:00.226: >> Clerk Beaudry: MAYOR, I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER CALLERS ON THE LINE.
01:41:03.196: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. SEEING NO ONE, PUBLIC COMMENT IS CLOSED. ARE THERE COMMUNICATIONS FROM COUNCIL? A MOTION TO ADJOURN, PLEASE. COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
01:41:20.513: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WANTED TO MAKE A COMMENT ABOUT OUR WORK ON THE GELMAN CLEANUP, BUT I WAS WONDERING IF YOU OR COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER WANTED TO GIVE MORE DETAILED INFORMATION BECAUSE I'M NEITHER A LAWYER, NOR DO I HAVE ALL THE DETAILED INFORMATION THAT COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER HAS. BUT IF NO ONE ELSE IS INTERESTED, I WILL. FIRST I WANT TO THANK CONGRESSWOMAN DEBBIE DINGLE. I KNOW THAT REGULARLY. MOST PEOPLE HAVE NO IDEA HOW HARD AND DILIGENTLY SHE HAS WORKED FOR MANY YEARS ON THIS. I THINK THAT THE BEST WAY TO SUM IT UP IS WE ARE AT A TIPPING POINT. WE HAVE HAD OVER A YEAR OF DELAYS, MISCOMMUNICATIONS AND AROUND ARE AN EFFORT TO EXCLUDE THE ELECTED OFFICIALS AND BY EXCLUDING THE ELECTED OFFICIALS OR INTERVENERS, THAT SILENCES THE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE. BECAUSE WE DON'T JUST WANT STAFF MEMBERS AND APPOINTED OFFICIALS IN LANSING MAKING DECISIONS FOR US. TODAY WE HAD A HEARING BEFORE JUDGE CONNORS. HE DENIED GELMAN'S MOTION TO RECONSIDER. WHAT THAT MEANS IS WE WILL BE HAVING A HEARING ON MAY 3rd, 4th AND 5th, AND HE WILL THEN -- JUDGE CONNORS WILL THEN MAKE A DECISION REGARDING THE GELMAN CLEANUP. AT THE SAME TIME, IT WAS MADE VERY CLEAR LAST THURSDAY NIGHT, THAT OUR REQUEST FOR THE E.P.A. IS NOT CONTINGENT ON ANY SETTLEMENT IN LANSING. I ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE ALL OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE NEW TO THE GELMAN CLEANUP, BECAUSE THEY ARE MAKING SOME VERY NAIVE COMMENTS ON SOCIAL MEDIA. BUT I WELCOME THEM AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE THEM TO LOOK AT MLIVE ARTICLES AS WELL AS THE C.A.R. D. WEBSITE. THANKS.
01:43:38.551: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER SONG.
01:43:40.553: >> Councilmember Song: HI, I JUST WANT TO IF I CAN TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME AND RECOGNIZE THE MASSACRE THAT HAPPENED IN TTHE ATLANTA AREA LAST WEEK AND HOW I HAVE BEEN HEARING FROM A NUMBER OF COMMUNITY MEMBERS. THERE'S A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF FEAR AND ANXIETY AND CONCLUSION AS TO WHAT IS HAPPENING IN OUR COUNTRY, AND THIS RISE IN ANTIASIAN HARASSMENT AND HATE AND VIOLENCE. I KNOW THAT THERE ARE LOCAL COMMUNITY MEMBERS ORGANIZING AND I'M TRYING TO HELP ORGANIZE RESOURCES BUT I REALLY ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO REPORT THIS, AND REACH OUT TO EACH OTHER. I ENCOURAGE ALLIES TO INTERVENE. THERE'S -- THERE ARE EXCELLENT RESOURCES ON BISTANDER INTERVENTION. WE NEED TO PRACTICE HOW TO CARE FOR EACH OTHER AND THERE WILL BE A VICTIMS OF ASIAN VIOLENCE THAT'S AT 7 P.M. ON THE STEPS OF ANGEL HALL. I HOPE I CAN SEE LOCAL ELECTED FOLKS COME AND JOIN AND GIVE SOME COMFORT AND SUPPORT.
01:44:47.487: >> Councilmember Hayner: COULD YOU SAY THE AGAIN.
01:44:49.655: >> Councilmember Song: IT'S THIS FRIDAY. THIS FRIDAY.
01:44:50.923: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU.
01:45:01.067: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER COMMUNICATION FROM COUNCIL. WITH COUNCIL MEMBER SONG'S REFERENCE TO THE MURDERS IN ATLANTA, AND THE -- THE TERRIBLE AND LOADS OF DISCRIMINATION AND HARASSMENT THAT PEOPLE ASIAN DISSENT, IT'S THE RESULT
