00:00:32.152: >> City Admin. Lazarus: I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT AND THANK HER AND THE STAFF AND ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY WHO HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS SO FAR. IT'S HEARTWARMING TO SEE HOW MUCH SUPPORT AND INTEREST THERE IS IN PUSHING FORWARD TO DEVELOP MORE AFFORDABILITY THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY. AS MS. HALL WILL GO THROUGH, THE ROAD IS NOT ALWAYS STRAIGHT. SOMETIMES IT TAKES SOME TWISTS AND TURNS AND AS WE GET ALL THROUGH THIS TOGETHER, REALIZE THERE'S PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITIES IN THE FUTURE TO DISCUSS OUTCOMES AS WELL AS THE PROCESS. WE ARE GUIDED ALONG THAT PATH BY JENNIFER'S EXPERTISE AND MOST CAPABLE HANDS. SO THE FLOOR IS YOURS.
00:01:10.623: >> OKAY. GREAT. THANK YOU, EVERYONE. I ACTUALLY WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE SOME OF THE STAFF AND SOME OF OUR CONSULTANTS THAT ARE HERE TONIGHT, BECAUSE THEY ARE ALSO AVAILABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AS THEY MAY ARISE. WE HAVE BRETT LENART, WHO IS THE PLANNING MANAGER. DEREK DELACOURT, HE'S TALKING TO MISSY STOLTZ IN THE SUSTAINABILITY DEPARTMENT, AND SUSAN PAULIE. AND TERESA GILLOTI WITH THE COUNTY. I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE COUNTY HAS A CONTRACT WITH THE CITY TO DO MANY THINGS RELATED TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING, INCLUDING ADMINISTERING BLOCK GRANT AND HOME FUNDS, SERVING AS THE LIAISON TO THE HOUSING AND HUMAN SERVICES ADVISORY BOARD. THEY ALSO ARE THE STAFFING TO THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUND, THE BROWNFIELD, THE WASHTENAW COUNTY BROWNFIELD AUTHORITY. SO THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT MAY COME UP THAT MAY WANT TO ASK TERESA ABOUT. WE ALSO HAVE MICHAEL JOHNSON. HE'S HERE WITH THE SMITH GROUP AND HE WILL BE TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE. AND I DON'T BELIEVE HE'S HERE YET, MARK NORMAN. I DID NOT SEE HIM. I THINK HE'S TEACHING RIGHT NOW, BUT HE DID OUR FINANCIAL MODELING. HE WILL BE HERE LATER TONIGHT IF YOU HAVE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT SOME OF THE FINANCIAL MODELING THAT WE DID. THERE'S ALSO MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT HERE TONIGHT THAT HELPED WORK ON THIS ANALYSES, AND I THANK THEM. IT WAS A LOT OF WORK. SO BEFORE WE GET STARTED AND GET INTO THE DETAILS OF OUR DISCUSSION, I JUST WANT TO REEMPHASIZE THAT DEVELOPMENT IS A LONG AND DIFFICULT PROCESS. THE PROJECT YOU THINK YOU HAVE AT INITIAL CONCEPT IS RARELY EXACTLY THE SAME PROJECT THAT IS BUILT, BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY VARIABLES THAT CAN IMPACT THE FINAL PRODUCT. THE MARKETPLACE CAN CHANGE RELATED TO FINANCING, MATERIALS, DEMAND, NEIGHBORS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS CAN PROVIDE INSIGHTS AND REQUEST FOR CHANGES. REGULATORY CONFLICTS CAN FORCE A DESIGN CHANGE, OR YOU CAN START REMOVING SOILS AND YOU FIND UNEXPECTED TREASURES OR UNEXPECTED TRASH THAT IMPACTS YOUR DEVELOPMENT. SO FOR THE PURPOSE OF TODAY'S DISCUSSION, I WOULD LIKE YOU TO THINK ABOUT THESE SITES AS HAVING UNLIMITED POSSIBILITIES. AND WE'RE BASICALLY TRYING TO NARROW DOWN PIECE BY PIECE TO GET CLOSER AND CLOSER TO A FINAL PROJECT. WE ARE LOOKING AT ALL OF THE SITES TOGETHER, BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO FALL INTO THAT TRAP OF TRYING TO MEET EVERY PROBLEM IN THE COMMUNITY ON ONE INDIVIDUAL SITE. SO WE WANT TO LOOK AT THEM AS A GROUP. EACH SITE WILL ULTIMATELY HAVE ITS OWN PATH, AND IT WILL MEET A DIFFERENT SET OF GOALS. ONE THING IS TRUE OF ALL THE SITES. WE DO NEED THE SUPPORT OF THE MAJORITY OF CITY COUNCILMEMBERS TO GET IT DEVELOPED. SO PLEASE TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TODAY TO BRING YOUR QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS TO THE DISCUSSION. OF COURSE, THERE'S ALWAYS MORE OPPORTUNITIES IN THE FUTURE AS WELL. SO WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS QUICKLY GO THROUGH WHERE WE LEFT OFF IN OUR NOVEMBER COUNCIL MEETING, WITH THE CURRENT RESOLUTIONS. THEN WE WILL TALK ABOUT THE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT PROCESS THAT HAPPENED ON SOUTH 5th, THE FORMER Y SITE AND 415 WEST WASHINGTON AND WHAT WE LEARNED FROM THOSE SITES. THERE WERE TWO ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL FEASIBILITY ANALYSES THAT WE WERE ASKED TO DO. SO I WILL GO OVER WHAT WE FOUND. THEN WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE PATH FORWARD. WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE IN TERMS OF TIMING, IN TERMS OF FUNDING? AND SO THAT IS HOW WE ARE GOING TO MOVE FORWARD TONIGHT. PLEASE INTERRUPT IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS. I THINK YOU CAN DO THAT, RIGHT? OR DO YOU HAVE TO LET PEOPLE KNOW WHEN THEY CAN SPEAK? [ LAUGHTER ] OKAY. SO IN NOVEMBER, THESE ARE THE RESOLUTIONS THAT WERE APPROVED FOR THESE SITES. THE DEVELOP AND START RIGHT NOW, WHICH I WANT TO REMIND EVERYONE IS A THREE TO FIVE-YEAR PROCESS. SO STARTING RIGHT NOW IS A LONG PROCESS. BEFORE SOMETHING IS BUILT AND OCCUPIED, THESE SITES WERE RECOMMENDED TO START RIGHT NOW BECAUSE FROM A FINANCIAL FEASIBILITY ANALYSES, THEY ARE PERFECT SITES FOR MODEST SIZED 50 TO 80 UNIT TAX CREDIT, LOW-INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT PROJECT, ALSO KNOWN AS LITCHT FUNDING. THAT'S THE MOST AFFORDABLE FOR THE FUND. THE FUNDING OFTEN CAN FUND 60, 70% OF AN ENTIRE PROJECT, USING PRIVATE FUNDING SOURCES. IN MICHIGAN, IT IS A VERY COMPETITIVE PROCESS. AND CURRENTLY THE PRIORITIES ARE REALLY ON DOWNTOWN SITES BECAUSE THEY HAVE HIGH WALK SCORES AND CLOSE TO AMENITIES AND EMPLOYMENT CENTERS AND THEY ARE IN NEIGHBORHOODS WITH OTHER INVESTMENTS ALREADY HAPPENING IN THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS, AND SO THE SITES THAT ARE IN THE DOWNTOWN, THAT ARE ELIGIBLE FOR TAX CREDITS, ARE SCORING HIGH RIGHT NOW AND THAT'S WHY WE ASKED TO MOVE A COUPLE OF SITES TO THE DEVELOPMENT RIGHT NOW WHICH IS THE CATHERINE AND FOURTHLONE 404 TO 406 NORTH ASHLEY. IN ADDITION, BECAUSE SITES ARE IN THE DOWNTOWN, THEY ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM THE DDA. ALL OF THE SITES THAT ARE OUTSIDE THE DOWNTOWN WILL HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME COMPETING FOR L LIHTCT FUNDING WHICH AVALON AND THE HOUSING COMMISSION HAS APPLIED FOR. IT'S ALL UNDER PERMANENT SUPPORT OF HOUSING THAT. CATEGORY HAS FEWER DEVELOPERS APPLYING FOR THOSE FUNDS. BUT IT ALSO HAS A HIGHER FINANCIAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENT AROUND THE SUPPORTIVE SERVICES DELIVERY, AS WELL AS THE FINANCING OF THOSE SERVICES. CONSEQUENTLY, ALL SITES THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT TODAY WOULD TARGET HOUSEHOLDS ROUGHLY IN THE $20,000 TO $60,000 RANGE, JUST DEPENDING ON SITE AND THE FAMILY SIZE. SO WHEN YOU ARE IMAGINING, AND WE ARE TALKING ABOUT EACH OF THESE SITES. WE ARE NOT PLANNING OF TAKING MILLER MANOR AND DROPPING IT INTO THE MIDDLE OF DOWNTOWN, UNLESS THAT'S WHAT THE COMMUNITY DEMANDS THAT WE DO AND THEY HAVE FUNDING FOR SUPPORTIVE SERVICES FOR THAT SITE. IN THE CATEGORY CALLED DEVELOPMENT WITH A -- WITH COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT, SORRY, OUR SITES THAT ARE EITHER VERY LARGE, HAVE A REALLY HIGH IMPACT SUCH AS THE SOUTH ASHLEY OR IN THE FLOODWAY FLOODPLAIN AND NEXT TO THE RAILROAD AND ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR TAX CREDIT FUNDING AND HAVE ADDITIONAL GREENWAY PUBLIC PURPOSE GOALS SUCH AS 721 NORTH MAIN AND 415 WEST WASHINGTON. IN ADDITION, THE HOUSING OWNS THE PLATT AND SPRINGBROOK WHICH WE WANT TO CONTINUE THE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT. THE CATEGORY CALLED DEVELOPMENT AFTER FURTHER STUDLY INCLUDES SOUTH INDUSTRIAL, WHICH IS A VERY LARGE SITE. IT'S NOT ELIGIBLE FOR TAX CREDIT FUNDING BECAUSE IT IS AT JACE AT TO A RAILROAD BUT IT'S A MORE CREATIVE WAY TO FINANCE A PROJECT AND SO WE WANT TO DO FURTHER STUDY ON HOW WE CAN FINANCE A PROJECT AT THAT SITE, SEUSSING OTHER ALTERN -- USING OTHER ALTERNATIVE FINANCING. IN ADDITION, THE HOUSING COMMISSION NEEDS TO CONSOLIDATE OUR OFFICES AND MAINTENANCE FACILITIES IN ONE LOCATION. ONE OF THE SITES THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT IS SOUTH INDUSTRIAL AND THE OTHER ONE FOR FURTHER STUDY IS AT EAST STADIUM WHERE FIRE HOUSE NUMBER TWO IS. AND SO THE LAST MEETING, WE ASK COUNCIL TO ALLOW US TO DO AN ARCHITECTURAL STUDY OF THAT SITE TO SEE IF IT WOULD BE MORE FEASIBLE AT THAT SITE AND ADD A.D.A. OFFICE SPACE OR BUILD NEW AT SOUTH INDUSTRIAL. FINALLY TWO ADDITIONAL SITES THAT WERE ADDED BY CITY COUNCIL IN NOVEMBER TO DETERMINE THE FINANCIAL FEASIBILITY. 353 SOUTH MAIN IS A CITY-OWNED PARKING LOT, NEXT TO PALEO, AS WELL AS 2857 PACKARD WHICH IS NOT OWNED BY THE CITY. IT'S LOCATED NEAR BURR PARK. WE WERE ASKED TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY AND PRESERVING LANDMARK TREES. I WOULD LIKE TO INVITE MICHAEL JOHNSON FROM SMITH GROUP UP TO TALK ABOUT WHAT WE LEARNED IN THE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT PROCESS, AND THE RESULTS OF THAT AT WEST WASHINGTON AND SOUTH 5th.
00:10:16.936: >> THANKS, JENNIFER. WE HAD A LONG WEEKEND AROUND THE TWO SITES THAT WE WERE ASKED TO LOOK AT. WE RAN FIVE DIFFERENT WORKSHOPS ACROSS FIVE DAYS, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY, SUNDAY AND A MONDAY. 20 HOURS OF WORKSHOPS. SO A COME AS YOU ARE SERIES OF WORKSHOPS THAT HAD THREE STATIONS AT EACH ONE THAT WAS MORE GENERALLY INFORMATIVE ABOUT KIND OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT KIND OF PROCESSES IN GENERAL AND THEN A STATION SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE Y LOT AND SPECIFICALLY ABOUT 415 WEST WASHINGTON. WE HAD ALMOST, YOU KNOW -- WE HAD ABOUT 135 PEOPLE THAT SIGNED IN, BUT CLOSER TO 150 TO 200 PEOPLE THAT SHOWED UP AT THE WORKSHOP. WE CONCURRENTLY RAN A WEBSITE THAT HAD 1300 UNIQUE USERS THAT SIGNED IN. OF WHICH 300 TOOK AN ONLINE SURVEY. WE GOT A PRETTY GOOD CROSS SECTION OF RESULTS, BOTH FROM RESIDENTS, NONRESIDENTS, PEOPLE WHO WORKED IN TOWN AND DIDN'T WORK IN TOWN. WE TARGETED TRYING TO GET A PRETTY WIDE RANGE OF RESPONSES FROM PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT AGES AND INCOMES, AND ACROSS ALL WARDS. SOME OF THE HIGH LEVEL SUMMARY POINTS THAT WE WERE ABLE TO GARNER FROM SOME OF THESE WORKSHOPS AND WE DID THIS IN A WAY THAT WE ACTUALLY PUT FORWARD A SERIES OF VIABLE OPTIONS FOR EACH OF THE SITES. AND SO FOR -- FOR THE Y LOT, THE FORMER Y LOT, WE HAD SIX DIFFERENT OPTIONS THAT TESTED A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT ALTERNATIVES. AND FRAMES THEN SOME QUESTIONS WHERE WE ASKED PEOPLE TO REALLY VOICE WHAT OBJECTIVES WERE IMPORTANT TO THEM TO ACHIEVE CERTAIN OUTCOMES AND YOU CAN SEE ON THE RIGHT-HAND SIDE OF THE SCREEN, SOME OF THE OBJECTIVES THAT KIND OF ROSE TO THE TOP OF THOSE 300 RESPONSES, CERTAINLY AROUND MAXIMIZING AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS AS THE KEY PRIORITY CREATING A MINIMUM OF 140 HOUSING FOR THOSE FAMILIES BELOW -- AT OR BELOW 60% A.M.I. BEING THE SECOND PRIORITY AND YOU CAN SEE AS YOU GO DOWN THE MIX OF HOUSING AND INTEREST 50 TYPES AND PRICES AND INTEREST IN KIND OF FIRST FLOOR BEING ACTIVE AND SO ON AND SO FORTH. AND I THINK IT WAS INTERESTING AS WE TESTED THESE DIFFERENT FORM OPTIONS. HIGH -- REAL HIGH PERCENTAGE OF KIND OF RESPONDENTS EMPHASIZING THAT MAXIMIZING AFFORDABLE HOUSING, ESPECIALLY ON THE FORMER Y LOT, WAS IMPORTANT TO THEM, REGARDLESS OF WHAT WE HEARD AND KIND OF READ INTO SOME OF THE DENSITY IMPLICATIONS THAT WOULD LEAD TO. THERE WAS THEN, AS WE PULLED APART SOME OF THE MORE NUANCED CONVERSATIONS AND STEPPING DOWN SOME OF THE DENSITY AS YOU GOT CLOSER TO WILLIAM AND SOME OF THE USES ACROSS STREET. AND THEN IT WAS INTERESTING, WE ALSO TESTED A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT ALTERNATIVES THAT SAID IF YOU ACTUALLY USED THE Y LOT AND THEN LOOKED AT THE AIR RIGHTS ABOVE THE BLAKE TRANSIT CENTER, COULD YOU CERTAINLY ADD MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS AND MORE MARKET RATE HOUSING UNITS IN DOING SO BUT AS WE TESTED THAT OUT, I THINK WHAT WE HERD FROM THE PUBLIC WAS THAT THERE MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT MORE CONCERN ABOUT ADDING THE COMPLEXITY THAT MIGHT COME WITH DOING THAT.
00:14:02.328: >> SO BASED ON WHAT WE LEARNED FROM THIS COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT PROCESS. WE ARE RECOMMENDING THAT CITY COUNCIL APPROVE THIS SITE, AND WE'LL BRING A RESOLUTION PROBABLY BACK PROBABLY IN MARCH WITH THE HOUSING COMMISSION AS THE DEVELOPER, ALONG WITH THE AAATA AS A PARTNER BUT WE ARE RECOMMENDING THAT STAFF WORK WITH THE CONSULTANT AND THE CITY COUNCIL TO PREENTITLE THE PROPERTY THROUGH THE LAPPING AND ZONING PROCESS, PRIOR TO ISSUING EITHER AN RFP OR AN RFQ TO DEVELOP THE SITE BECAUSE WE WOULD NEED TO WORK WITH A PRIVATE DEVELOPER ON ANY OF THE SITES WE DEVELOP. WE ALWAYS WORK WITH THE A PRIVATE DEVELOPER BUT BEING SO LARGE AND REQUIRING MORE OF A MIXED INCOME, MIXED USE TYPE OF SITE, WE WOULD NEED TO HAVE THE EXPERTISE OF A PRIVATE DEVELOPER BUT WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SOME CERTAINTY GOING INTO THAT PROCESS, IN ADVANCE, WHERE WE WOULD PREENTITLE THE BASIC FOOTPRINT OF WHAT THE SITE WOULD LOOK LIKE. THIS SITE IS ELIGIBLE FOR TAX CREDITS, BUT BEING SO LARGE, IT REALLY MAXES OUT ON A PER PROJECT BASIS ON THE FUNDING FUG PRETTY QUICKLY AT 80 OR 90 UNITS OF THE MAYBE 400 THAT WE COULD PUT ON THE SITE. WE COULD DO TWO TAX CREDIT PROJECTS WITH TWO DIFFERENT PHASES AND THE REST WOULD BE MIXED INCOME AND THEN WE WOULD LOOK AT DOING OTHER USES ON THE SITE, INCLUDING PANDING THE FOOTPRINT OF THE -- EXPANDING THE AAATA, UNDERNEATH OR AROUND THE BUILDING.
00:15:34.520: >> AND THEN SO SIMILARLY, SOME OF THE HIGH-LEVEL POINTS THAT WE LEARNED FROM TESTING SOME DIFFERENT ALTERNATIVES AT 415 WEST WASHINGTON, HERE UNLIKE THE Y LOT, WHERE THE ZONING -- IT WAS MORE CERTAIN. SO FOR THE Y LOT, IT IS ASSUMED TO BE D-1 ZONING. THE ZONING AT 415 WEST WASHINGTON IS CURRENTLY PUBLIC LAND AND WE COULD TEST A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT ALTERNATIVES THAT WENT FROM D-2 TO R4-C AND IN BETWEEN. JUST IN GENERAL, WE HEARD LESS COMMENTS ABOUT 415 THAN WE DID ABOUT THE Y LOT. SO THAT WAS INTERESTING TO US. THE PEOPLE THAT CAME CHOSE TO FOCUS THEIR ATTENTION ON ONE AND NOT THE OTHER. AGAIN, HERE SIMILARLY, MAJORITY OF RESPONDENTS EMPHASIZING THE NEED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING REGARDING SOME OF THE DENSITY IMPLICATIONS. THERE WERE THEN SOME NUANCED COMMENTS AROUND STEPPING DOWN DEVELOPMENT, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU TRIED TO GET CLOSE TO MAXING OUT THE D2 ZONING TOWARDS WASHINGTON AND TOWARDS THE RESIDENTIAL USES. AND THERE WERE SOME OTHER COMMENTS THAT WERE SUPPORTIVE OF -- BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE CHALLENGES, BOTH ENVIRONMENTAL AND BEING IN PORTIONS IN THE FLOODWAY AND PORTIONS IN THE FLOODPLAIN, THAT MAYBE WE CONSIDER SELLING THIS PROPERTY AND TAKING SOME OF THOSE FUNDS AND PUTTING IT TOWARDS AFFORDABLE HOUSING ELSEWHERE. WHEN WE THEN ASKED A SERIES OF QUESTIONS BOTH ONLINE AND IN PERSON AROUND SOME OF THE PREFERRED OBJECTIVES OVERWHELMING SUPPORT FOR REMEDIATING ANY POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS CONNECTING THE TREELINE TRAIL, AND THEN THIRD MAXIMIZING AFFORDABLE UNITS. A LOT OF SUPPORT FOR OUR BELOVED CHIMNEY SWIFT HABITAT ON THE OLD WEST SIDE AND THEN YOU CAN SEE AS YOU GO DOWN SOME OTHER COMMENTS ON PROVIDING ADDITIONAL USES, MENTIONING SALE OF THE PROPERTY AND THEN FITTING IN WITH THE NEIGHBORHOOD AS IT RELATES TO JUST ADDITIONAL HEIGHTS AND THEN PARK SPACE YOU CAN SEE IS NUMBER EIGHT.
00:17:46.418: >> THE SITE HAS MANY POTENTIAL SITE ISSUES, AS MICHAEL MENTIONED, THAT WILL IMPACT THE COST AND THE DESIGN OF THE DEVELOPMENT. THERE'S SEVERAL COMMUNITY GOALS, INCLUDING MINIMIZING THE DISTURBANCE OF THE FLOODWAY FLOODPLAIN, A FUTURE GREENWAY, DEMOLISHING A BLIGHTED BUILDING, CLEANING UP SITE CONTAMINATION, PRESERVATION OF THE CHIMNEY WHERE THE CHIMNEY SWIFTS ARE NESTING. SOME OF THESE ARE COMPLIMENTARY. SOMETIMES THEY ARE COMPETING GOALS THAT MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR THE SITE TO GUARANTEE DEVELOPMENT INCLUDES AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SO AT SITE IS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL HUD FUNDING NOR IS IT ELIGIBLE FOR LIHTC BECAUSE OF THE FLOODWAY AND THE RAILROAD. WE ARE NOT RECOMMENDING THAT THE HOUSING COMMISSION DOES THE SITE. WE CAN CONTINUE TO DO CONSULTING. BASED ON WHAT WE LEARNED THROUGH THE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT, WE ARE RECOMMENDING THAT CITY STAFF WORK WITH A CONSULTANT AND CITY COUNCIL AGAIN TO PREENTITLE THE SITE PRIOR TO ISSUING AN RFP OR RFQ TO A PRIVATE DEVELOPER. THE SITE IS ELIGIBLE FOR BROWNFIELD TIF. SO IF A DEVELOPER REQUESTED BROWNFIELD TIF FINANCING IT WOULD TRIGGER A MINIMUM OF 15% OF THE UNITS TO BE AFFORDABLE, OTHERWISE THERE MAY NOT BE ANY TRIGGER FOR AFFORDABLE UNITS AND IF THERE WERE AFFORDABLE UNITS INCLUDED ON SITE, IT WOULD BE REGULATED BY THE COUNTY. THE WAY THAT THEY DO THE -- THE -- I FORGOT THE NAME OF THE APARTMENTS, THE ANN ARBOR CITY APARTMENTS ON 1st AND WASHINGTON. THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF A SITE WHERE IF WE DID HAVE AFFORDABLE UNITS INCLUDED BY A PRIVATE DEVELOPER, WE WOULD LIKE TO IMPLEMENT A PUBLIC WAIT LIST TO MANAGE AND MARKET THE AFFORDABLE UNITS PROVIDED BY A PRIVATE DEVELOPER THROUGH ZONING OR BROWNFIELD PROCESS WHICH IS DIFFERENT THAN THE TYPES OF UNITS THE HOUSING COMMISSION CURRENTLY HAS ON OUR SITES THAT WE HAVE A HUD-REGULATED WAIT LIST FOR AND THE IDEA IS TO LET PEOPLE KNOW IN THE COMMUNITY THAT THESE UNITS ARE AVAILABLE, OTHERWISE, IT'S HARD TO KNOW ABOUT THEM. SHOULD WE PAUSE AND SEE IF THERE'S ANY -- KEEP GOING? OKAY. SO THE NEXT SITE WE WERE ASKED TO DO A FINANCIAL FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS ON WAS 353 SOUTH MAIN. IT WAS VERY SIMILAR TO THE CATHERINE AND 404 NORTH ASHLEY. IT'S A MODESTLY SIZED SITE. AND IT'S ELIGIBLE FOR TAX CREDITS AND IT SCORES HIGH. ALL OF THOSE THINGS. AND FROM A FINANCIAL FEASIBILITY PERSPECTIVE, IT IS DEFINITELY A GOOD SITE TO BE REDEVELOPED AS AFFORDABLE HOUSING THROUGH THE LIHTC PROCESS, HOWEVER, WE ARE RECOMMENDING THAT THE SITE GO THROUGH COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT, SIMILAR TO WEST WASHINGTON AND THE FORMER Y. MOSTLY BECAUSE I WILL ALSO LATER ON IN THE PRESENTATION TALKING ABOUT ADDING IN CATHERINE INTO A BIGGER COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT PROCESS AND DO ALL OF THOSE SITES THAT ARE STILL  IN THE DOWNTOWN TOGETHER. WE LEARNED, I THINK FROM THE CATHERINE SITE, WE HAD A LOT OF COMMENTS ABOUT THE PROPOSAL AT CATHERINE AND SO IT DOESN'T REALLY NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO MOVE FORWARD AND HAVE A BIGGER COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND LEARN MORE FROM THE COMMUNITY. AND SO WE MIGHT AS WELL ADD IN 353 SOUTH MAIN AS WELL. AGAIN, THE INCOME TARGET IS ROUGHLY 20 TO $60,000 AND THIS IS A LITTLE BIT SMALLER SIZED PARCEL AND IT MIGHT BE 30 TO 50 UNITS HERE. WE WOULD LIKE TO BRING A RESOLUTION, PROBABLY IN MARCH AGAIN, RECOMMENDING COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND THEN MOVE FORWARD TO DEVELOPMENT. 2857 IS NOT A CITY-OWNED PROPERTY. AS I THINK I MENTIONED EARLIER, BUT WE WERE ASKED TO LOOK AT THE SITE FOR THE POTENTIAL OF PRESERVING LANDMARK TREES THAT SOME NEIGHBORS AND COUNCILMEMBERS ARE INTERESTED IN. YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO SEE FROM THIS SKETCH IF YOU LOOK AT THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE SKETCH, THAT LINE WHERE THE BLUE TRIANGLES AND ALL OF THAT ARE IS BASICALLY WHERE PACKARD IS, AND THE SITE STRETCHES -- IT'S A LITTLE BIT LONGER THAN WHAT IT SHOWS ON THE SCREEN. IT'S A LONG SKINNY SITE, AND THE BEST PLACE -- IF YOU WERE TO PRESERVE THE TREES, THIS IS AN AERIAL -- A MUCH OLDER ARIEL AEL SHOWING THE TREES THAT WERE GROWING, 60 OR 70 OR 80 YEARS AGO WHERE YOU CAN SEE MOST IMPORTANT OLDEST TREES ARE AND IT'S ON THAT BOUNDARY THAT'S ON THE BOTTOM. AND SO IF YOU WERE TO ACTUALLY DEVELOP THE SITE AS AFFORDABLE HOUSING. YOU WOULD WANT TO BUILD ON THE HIGHEST AND DRIEST SPOT WHICH IS THE BACK OF THE PROPERTY, THE FARTHEST AWAY FROM THE ROAD WHICH MAKES IT MORE EXPENSIVE TO DEVELOP WHEN YOU HAVE THAT LONG OF A DISTANCE TO RUN YOUR INFRASTRUCTURE. AND THE -- BECAUSE THE CITY DOESN'T OWN IT, THE ACQUISITION IS A BIG QUESTION MARK. I PUT IN ESTIMATED 75 TO $100,000 A UNIT, BUT I FORGOT, I WAS TO UPDATE THAT TO UP TO $160,000 A UNIT, BASED ON MODELING THAT MARK NORMAN DID AFTER I HAD TO GET THIS PUBLISHED AND THAT'S A BIG BARRIER TO DOING AFFORDABLE HOUSING, THAT ACQUISITION, THAT'S WHY WE ARE LOOKING AT PUBLICLY OWNED SITE, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE HIGH ACQUISITION, IT MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO FINANCE IT THROUGH NORMAL WAYS THAT WE WOULD FINANCE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IT ALSO ALTHOUGH ELIGIBLE FOR TAX CREDITS SCORES VERY POORLY AGAIN BECAUSE IT'S NOT IN THE DOWNTON. AS AN EXAMPLE, THE HOUSING COMMISSION IS IN THE PROCESS OF BUILDING OUR SITES ON STATE STREET, AS WELL AS PLATT. WE HAD TO APPLY FIVE TIMES. IT TOOK US THREE YEARS TO GET TAX CREDITS TO THOSE SITES AND THAT'S A SUPPORTIVE HOUSING SITE IN THE LAST COMPETITIVE CATEGORY AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES CHALLENGING, THAT'S JUST HOW THE SCORING IS TODAY. IT MIGHT CHANGE IN TWO YEARS. WE DON'T KNOW BUT THAT'S WHAT THE SCORING IS TODAY. SO WE ARE -- OH, GO AHEAD.
00:24:13.838: >> Councilmember Nelson: SINCE YOU ARE ON THE TOPIC. CAN YOU GO INTO A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL ABOUT HOW THE SCORING PUTS AN ADVANTAGED PROPERTIES LOCATED DOWNTOWN?
00:24:26.551: >> SURE. I HAVE THE ACTUAL SHEET OR I CAN SEND IT TO YOU. THE THINGS I REMEMBER OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD THERE. A WALK SCORE IS HIGHLY RATED AND SO ALL THE DOWNTOWN SITES ARE IN THE 90s. THIS SITE IS MORE LIKE IN THE 50s OR 60s, IF I RECALL. HAVING BEEN NEAR A CERTAIN SIZED EMPLOYMENT CENTER, YOU HAVE TO BE WITHIN A CERTAIN DISTANCE AND ONLY ONES WITHIN THE DISTANCE OF THE CENTER, 250 EMPLOYEES OR MORE, PUTS YOU WHERE THE COUNTY BUILDING IS AND THE U OF M IS. THE OTHER SCORES ARE -- IS IT AN AREA WHERE THERE'S A NEIGHBORHOOD COMMUNITY INVESTMENT PLAN WHICH WE DON'T HAVE IN ANY OF OUR NEIGHBORHOODS? AND IF NOT, THEN WHAT OTHER INVESTMENT IS HAPPENING IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD AND WE ARE TALKING MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. IF I RECALL MAYBE THE THRESHOLD WAS $50 MILLION OF INVESTMENT WITHIN A SMALL AREA. AND WE HAVE THAT HAPPENING IN THE DOWNTOWN. SO WE GET POINTS FOR THAT HAPPENING, THAT WE DON'T HAVE THAT OUT IN THE FARTHER NEIGHBORHOODS. AND THEN WE GET SMALL SPECIFIC NUMBER OF POINTS FOR HOW FAR AWAY ARE YOU FROM A PHARMACY, FOR EXAMPLE. I THINK THAT'S WORTH ONE POINT. YOU HAVE TOBACC TO BE WITHIN A .
00:25:49.768: >> Councilmember Nelson:  WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT INVESTMENT, IS THAT PUBLIC OR PRIVATE INVESTMENT?
00:25:56.941: >> IT CAN BE BOTH. AND YOU HAVE TO GET A LETTER SIGNED BY THE MAYOR OR THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR, VERIFYING THAT, YES, ALL OF THIS INVESTMENT IS HAPPENING IF YOU DON'T HAVE A COMMUNITY INVESTMENT PLAN WITH A SPECIFIC NEIGHBORHOOD THAT. EASILY HAPPENS IN THE DOWNTOWN, AS FAR AS ALL THE DIFFERENT INVESTMENT THAT'S HAPPENING DOWN THERE. THOSE ARE THE MAIN REASONS. YEAH. BECAUSE MOST OF THE OTHER ITEMS THAT YOU GET POINTS ON RELATED TO WHO THE DEVELOPER, IS WHO THE PROPERTY MANAGER IS. IF IT'S THE HOUSING COMMISSION, WITH OUR USUAL TEAM, WE SCORE THE SAME EVERY SITE. SO IT'S DOWN TO THE SITE-SPECIFIC CRITERIA THAT PULLS THE PROJECTS THAT DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. SO AT THIS TIME, WE ARE NOT RECOMMENDING ANY ACTION RELATED TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING ON THIS SITE.
00:26:48.693: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES, HI, THANKS, JENNIFER. I WANTED TO INCLUDE SOME OF WHAT YOU AND I WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS AFTERNOON. NO SOONER DID I FINISH TALKING WITH YOU, WHEN I ACTUALLY TALKED WITH MR. LAZARUS ALSO ABOUT IT. SO JUST FOR COUNCIL AND EVERYONE ELSE, THAT IT DOESN'T SCORE IN TOTAL A HIGH FOR THE HOUSING COMMISSION, HOWEVER, MR. LAZARUS AND I ARE STILL GOING TO EXPLORE PIECING TOGETHER DIFFERENT COURSES OF INCOME, SUCH AS THE COBBLESTONE FARMS EXPANSION POTENTIAL, YOU KNOW, DO THEY HAVE A SINKING FUND TO EXPAND AND WOULD THEY BE INTERESTED IN HELPING WITH THIS NEIGHBORING PROPERTY? AND THEN ALSO OTHER STATE GRANTS AND CONSERVATION FUNDS AND EVEN PRIVATE FUNDING. SO IT'S PART OF A MULTIPIECE PROJECT.
00:27:44.415: >> Councilmember Lumm: JUST A LQUICK QUESTION. THANK YOU, VERY MUCH, JENNIFER. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE PROPERTY OWNER SIGNED A LAND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT FOR THIS PROPERTY. SINCE WE HAD APPROVED THE SITE PLAN. I SEE MR. LAZARUS IS NODDING YES. SO WHAT'S BEING SUGGESTED HERE IS RECOMMENDED AS THINGS TO POTENTIALLY PURSUE, EVEN THOUGH THE LAND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT HAS BEEN SIGNED BY THE DEVELOPER AND THE CITY. APPARENTLY IT HAPPENED LAST WEEK.
00:28:30.495: >> City Admin. Lazarus: COUNCILP FOR POTENTIAL FUNDING SOURCES. IT DOESN'T ASSUME ANY COUNCIL ACTION AT THE END. SO THAT WAS OUR CONVERSATION.
00:28:47.011: >> Councilmember Bannister: DOES THAT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, JANE? THE LAND DEVELOPMENT -- I WAS WORRIED MORE ABOUT PERMITS TO REMOVE THE TREES. I WASN'T LOOKING FOR THE LAND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT MORE SO.
00:29:04.529: >> Councilmember Lumm: IT WAS JUST SIGNED LAST WEEK.
00:29:06.865: >> Councilmember Bannister: I'M NOT SURE WHAT THAT MEANS. I THINK I'M STILL INTERESTED IN RESEARCHING OPTIONS TO PIECE TOGETHER FUNDING FOR THIS PROJECT UNTIL SUCH TIMES AS THE TREES ARE REMOVED. SO THERE WILL BE A PERMIT COMMITTED TO THE CITY WHEN THEY GET READY TO DO THAT AND COUNCIL WILL BE NOTIFIED WHEN THAT IS SUBMITTED. AS FAR AS THE LAND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT, IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY ARE MOVING FORWARD, BUT I DON'T --
00:29:47.572: >> Mayor Taylor: MS. HALL.
00:29:48.172: >> SO TO TIE ALL OF THESE SITES TOGETHER. TO GIVE THE MAYOR AND THE COUNCIL A TIMELINE, I CREATED THIS VERY SIMPLE CHART. EACH SITE IS A STANDALONE PROJECT ON ITS OWN TRAJECTORY AND EACH ONE STANDING ALONE IS A REALISTIC SCENARIO, BUT THEY WILL ALL END UP COMPLETELY DIFFERENT IF WE LOOK BACK A YEAR OR FIVE YEARS FROM NOW. ON THE LEFT, THE ORANGE AND TO THE RIGHT IS RED. ON THE LEFT IS REALLY THE -- AT THE CONCEPT STAGE AND RED IS OCCUPANCY AND THERE'S LOTS OF DIFFERENT STAGES IN BETWEEN. THEY AREN'T FIXED IN LENGTH OR IT'S JUST A MATTER OF I USED AN EXCEL SPREADSHEET SIX MONTH INCREMENTS AND THEY CAN OVERLAP EACH OTHER. THIS IS JUST A SIMPLE LOOK AT WHAT IT COULD LOOK LIKE, AND DEPENDING ON THE SITE AND WHO THE DEVELOPER IS, IT HAS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT RECOMMENDATIONS. SO IF YOU START AT THE TOP, 121 NORTH CATHERINE, BASED ON THE NOVEMBER COUNCIL RESOLUTION, WE ARE IN GREEN, WHICH WOULD BE THE DEVELOPER DOES THE DESIGN AND SITE PLAN, WHICH WOULD BE THE HOUSING COMMISSION. COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT IS PART OF THE BUILT -- BUILT INTO THAT PROCESS. AS I MENTIONED AS  AN ALTERNATIVE, IF THE COUNCIL WANTS A MORE ROBUST COUNCIL PROCESS, WE CAN ADD THAT INTO WHAT WE ARE RECOMMENDING FOR THE NORTH MAIN AND THE SOUTH ASHLEY AND THE 353 SOUTH MAIN SITES. AND IT WOULD PROBABLY CAUSE ABOUT A SIX-MONTH DELAY, BUT IT WOULDN'T PREVENT US FROM ALSO LOOKING AT, YOU KNOW, DOING DESIGN AND THAT'S OKAY. THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM. 353 SOUTH MAIN AND THE OTHER SITES I JUST MENTIONED STARTING OUT WITH DOING COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT. WE ALREADY WENT OVER SOUTH 5th E DARKER GREEN IS THE PREENTITLEMENT PART OF THE PROCESS. AND THEN SOUTH INDUSTRIAL AND -- SOUTH INDUSTRIAL IS STILL IN THE ANALYZING STAGE. PLATT AND SPRINGBROOK, IT WAS ACTUALLY VOTED ON TO BE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT. ALTERNATIVELY, I MIGHT END UP SELLING THAT PROPERTY TO RAISE FUNDING FOR SOUTH INDUSTRIAL OR ANOTHER SITE. THE 404 NORTH ASHLEY SITE THAT WAS -- IT COULD LOOK LIKE CLOSER TO NORTH CATHERINE SITE, BUT WE'RE NOT 100% SURE WHAT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, WHAT THEIR TIME FRAME IS FOR MOVING OUT, WE NEED TO HAVE MORE DIALOGUE WITH THEM AND SEE WHERE THEY ARE AT IN THEIR PROCESS. THE WORST CASE SCENARIO IS THE LENGTH THAT YOU SEE, THAT'S THE ENTIRE FOUR AND A HALF YEARS THAT ARE POTENTIALLY LEFT ON THEIR LEASE BEFORE WE WOULD GO INTO THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS. SO HOPEFULLY THAT WILL BE SHORTER THAN WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE RIGHT THERE. AND THEN 1501 EAST STADIUM, DO THIS ANALYSIS AND STUDY OF ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN AND THEN REALLY I CAN'T MOVE FORWARD AS HOUSING OR AS OFFICES UNTIL THE FIRE DEPARTMENT HAS ACTUALLY MOVED OUT OF THE SITE.
00:32:56.994: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
00:32:58.162: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THE TERM THAT YOU USED PREENTITLEMENT FOR THE BASIC FOOTPRINT. THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE TO ME. IT'S TOTALLY LOGICAL. I'M CURIOUS, WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE.
00:33:10.608: >> HAS IT HAPPENED BEFORE? WHAT DID IT LOOK LIKE WHEN IT WAS UTILIZED BEFORE, IF IT HAS?
00:33:15.446: >> GOOD EVENING MAYOR AND COUNCIL, BRETT LENART THE PLANNING MANAGER. IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ENVISION FOR A MORE SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION AT THE EXECUTION OR THE LEASE OF A SALE. THAT IS DOING, PERHAPS -- ENLING IT -- IT COULD HAPPEN THROUGH A VARIETY OF MEANS. ONE THE WAYS IS THROUGH A PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT PROCESS AND THAT COULD MANIFEST IN A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT WAYS, AT A MINIMUM, WE COULD SET UP SORT OF THE BASIC PARAMETERS OF WHAT THE DEVELOPMENT EXPECTATIONS ARE FROM AMASSING SIZE, NUMBER OF AFFORDABLE UNITS, ET CETERA. THAT ALSO GIVES US THE FLEXIBILITY TO ADDRESS ANY TRADEOFFS THAT WE MADE DECISIONS ON, FOR EXAMPLE, PRESERVING A CHIMNEY OR OTHER ASPECTS OF ANY SITE DEVELOPMENT. WE CAN MEMORIAL THOSE IN THE AGREEMENT AND THEN WHEN THE CITY THEN SEEKS A DEVELOPMENT PARTNER, THAT GIVES US THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE VERY CLEAR AND HAVE A VERY CLEAR PLAYBOOK AS TO WHAT IS GOING TO BE EXPECTED AND ULTIMATELY APPROVED FOR THAT SITE. WE COULD THEN TAKE THAT EVEN FURTHER TO ACTUALLY SITE PLAN A SITE, AND THEN AT THE TIME OF ENGAGING A DEVELOPMENT PARTNER, TAKE THAT LEVEL OF ENTITLEMENT TO ACTUALLY TURN OVER NOT ONLY RIGHTS TO DEVELOP THE SITE BUT A PREFULLY READY TO ISSUE BUILDING MER MITTS DEVELOPMENT ON THAT SITE. THAT OBVIOUSLY HAS MORE OF AN ELEMENT OF RISK THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DESIGN SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE TRANSFERABLE BUT THERE'S PRECEDENT WHERE THAT HAS HAPPENED IN OUR COMMUNITY, MORE ON A PRIVATE SECTOR TO PRIVATE SECTOR TIME, WHERE ONE ENTITY HAS DEVELOPED THE ENTITLEMENT OF A SITE PLAN. BOTH OF THOSE WOULD BE POSSIBLE.
00:35:04.755: >> Councilmember Nelson:  SO IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE THAT PROCESS -- HOW DOES THAT PROCESS DIFFER FROM WHAT WOULD BE HAPPENING ORDINARILY FOR A PUD. AND THE WAY I HEARD YOUR DECDESCRIPTION, IT SOUNDED THE SAME. LIKE YOU SAID, THE PRIVATE ENTITY COULD GO THROUGH THE PROCESS AND GET ENTITLEMENT TO PASS THAT.
00:35:30.114: >> THE FORMER MIGHT BE SIMILAR TO THE RECENT PUD AND AREA PLAN APPROVED FOR BROADWAY PARK, 841 BROADWAY, THE FORMER D.E.T. COAL GASIFICATION SITE. THAT WAS WHERE THE SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS AND AN AREA OR CONCEPT PLAN ARE ADOPTED AND THEN THEY HAVE TO -- THEY ARE NOW COMING BACK THROUGH THE FORMAL SITE PLAN PROCESS, COMPARED TO PROJECTS THAT HAVE COME IN FOR PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT SUCH AS -- WELL, THE GLEN IS A GREAT EXAMPLE WHERE THAT WAS SEEKING REZONING AND A FULLY DEVELOPED SITE PLAN WITH ALL ASPECTS. THAT'S SORT OF POTENTIALLY ONE STEP APPROVAL PROCESS.
00:36:06.550: >> Councilmember Nelson: OKAY. ALL RIGHT. THAT'S CLEARER. THANK YOU.
00:36:13.224: >> THE REASON WE ARE RECOMMENDING THE PREENTITLEMENT AT SOME OF THESE SITES IS TO BOTH HAVE THE COMMUNITY INPUT UP FRONT, WHAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE, BUT TO REMOVE THE RISK WHEN IT CO COMES TIME FOR A DEVELOPEO BID OR RESPOND TO AN RFP OR RFQ PROCESS BECAUSE WE ALREADY HAVE SOMETHING THAT THEY KNOW THEY CAN BUILD. I THINK IS THE ONLY PLACE I SHOULD MENTION THIS. 721 NORTH MAIN -- I'M SORRY, SOUTH ASHLEY, THE FORMER -- SOME PEOPLE CALL IT THE KLEIN'S LOT. IF YOU LOOK AT THE LIGHT BLUE SECTION, WHERE IN OTHER PLACES IT SAYS CITY STAFF AND THAT ONE HAS CITY DOLLAR, DOLLAR. POTENTIALLY A SITE THAT WE COULD SELL AND USE THE PROCEEDS TO DEVELOP HOUSING OR ACQUIRE HOUSING THAT'S OUTSIDE OF THE DOWNTOWN, SINCE WE ALREADY HAVE A LOT OF SITES ARE IN THE DOWNTOWN. THIS IS A BIG, COMPLEX SITE. IT MAKES MORE SENSE FOR THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO TAKE THE LEAD ON IT AND COULD YOU PREENTITLE THAT WAS WELL OR NOT.
00:37:22.059: >> Councilmember Ackerman: JUST TO MAKE SURE I'M READING THE CALENDAR CORRECTLY. SO FOR EXAMPLE, 350 SOUTH 5th, WOULD YOU EXPECT PRE-ENTITLEMENT TO BE COMPLETED BY JANUARY OF NEXT YEAR?
00:37:39.777: >> ON A GOOD SCHEDULE, YES.
00:37:41.178: >> Councilmember Ackerman: OKAY. THANK YOU.
00:37:42.246: >> IF THAT WAS THE ONLY PROJECT THAT WE WERE WORKING ON, WE COULD PROBABLY MAKE THAT HAPPEN.
00:37:49.387: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU, JENNIFER. THIS IS VERY COMPLICATED AND YOU AND YOUR TEAM HAVE DONE OUTSTANDING WORK. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING US TO THIS POINT. SO SINCE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THIS PRE-ENTITLEMENT MONEY, I NOTICED THAT THE DOLLAR AMOUNT IS YET TO BE DETERMINED AND YOU LIST IN THE PRE-ENTITLEMENT-FUNDED OR DEVELOPED PARCELS 415, THE Y LOT, AND ALSO A REQUEST FOR DDA FUNDING AND I'M JUST WONDERING IN TERMS OF THE Y LOT, THE RECOMMENDATION AS YOU NOTE IS FOR A MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT, CODEVELOPED BY A PRIVATE DEVELOPER, THE HOUSING COMMISSION AND AAATA, AND ON THE BOTTOM OF THE DEVELOPMENT OPTIONS ATTACHMENT THAT YOU GAVE US, THE CODEVELOPMENT STRUCTURE IS LISTED AS A CON IN THE PROS AND CONS LIST. YOU NOTE THAT IT'S, QUOTE, MORE COMPLICATED FINANCING WITH CO-OWNERSHIP DEVELOPMENT. AND IF I'M JUMPING AHEAD JUST STOP ME.
00:39:03.327: >> THAT WAS THE NEXT SLIDE.
00:39:05.896: >> Councilmember Lumm: IT OCCURRED TO ME AS WELL BECAUSE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THIS PRE-ENTITLEMENT STUFF. YOU CAN DO THIS NOW OR LATER, I WONDER IF YOU COULD HELP US UNDERSTAND AND EXPAND A BIT ON HOW THIS CODEVELOPMENT WOULD WORK IN TERMS OF ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES PARTICULARLY FOR THE Y LOT, SINCE THAT SEEMS TO BE THE ONE THAT'S GOING TO BE COMING TO US RELATIVELY SOON. AND UNDERSTANDING WHAT AAATA'S ROLE AND PARTICIPATION WOULD BE, I'M VERY INTERESTED IN HAVING A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THAT. AND ALSO, IF YOU KNOW WHETHER EXAMPLES IN OTHER CITIES, WHERE SIMILAR CODEVELOPMENT STRUCTURE WORKED EFFECTIVELY IN CREATING AFOR THIBLE HOUSING UNITS. -- AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS.
00:39:51.041: >> AT THIS STAGE OF WHERE WE ARE AT, I CANNOT TELL YOU EXACTLY. IT'S STILL LIKE THE CONCEPT STAGE, BUT I CAN TELL YOU WAYS IT COULD HAPPEN. IN WORKING WITH THE AAATA, I SEE IT AS LIKELY GOING TO BE US FIGURING OUT HOW TO MAKE A BETTER SITE FOR WHERE THEY ARE AT. THEY MAY OR MAY NOT BE ABLE TO BRING FUNDING TO THE TABLE, BECAUSE THEY TYPICALLY GET FEDERAL FUNDS AND IT MIGHT BE A LONG PROCESS. AND SO THAT WOULD BE PART OF THE DISCUSSIONS ON RULES AND WHAT COULD YOU BRING TO THE TABLE? BUT WANTING TO AT LEAST DESIGN SOMETHING THAT IS COMPATIBLE WITH WHAT WOULD MAKE THEIR SITE WORK BETTER FOR THEIR BUSES. AND WITH THE PRIVATE DEVELOPER, DIFFERENT FROM THE PROJECTS THAT WE DO RIGHT NOW, WHERE WE OWN AND MANAGE AND DO THE WHOLE PROCESS, WHAT WE USE A PRIVATE DEVELOPER FOR IS THEY ARE MOSTLY THERE FOR HELPING US SECURE TAX CREDIT FINANCING. THEY ARE DEFINITELY EXPERTS -- WE HAVE USED IN THAT AREA YOU REALLY CAN'T DO IT WITHOUT HAVING THAT BACKGROUND. IT'S REALLY CHALLENGING. BUT MAINLY TO OVERSEE CONSTRUCTION. THEY ARE THE GRANTOR ON ALL THE CONSTRUCTION. THEY OVERSEE THE ARCHITECT, THE ENGINEER, THE GENERAL CONTRACTOR AND ESSENTIALLY ONCE THE BUILDING IS BUILT, WE GET ALL OF OUR C OF Os WHERE WE TAKE OVER THE OPERATIONS AND THE PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AND PUTTING TENANTS IN THE BUILDING. WE CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER TO MEETING THE COMPLIANCE OF TAX CREDIT FOR A COUPLE MORE YEARS AND THEN THEY GET OUT OF THE PICTURE. WHAT WOULD BE DIFFERENT ON THIS SITE IS IT'S SUCH A LARGE SITE, THAT IT MAY END UP HAVING MULTIPLE CONDOS, DEPENDING ON IF IT MAKES SENSE ON THE FINANCING, AND SO DEPENDS ON WHO THE DEVELOPER IS ON WHAT THEY WANT TO DO, WHETHER THEY WANT TO DO FOR SALE, WHETHER THEY WANT TO DO RENTAL. IT WOULD VERY LIKELY HAVE MULTIPLE PHASES JUST BECAUSE OF IT MAXING OUT ON THE TAX CREDIT SIDE. SO THEN IT WOULD BE A DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW ARE WE GOING TO MANAGE THIS PROPERTY? ARE WE GOING TO HAVE ONE PROPERTY MANAGER? AND IS IT GOING TO BE THE HOUSING COMMISSION AND WE GET PAID TO MANAGE THE REST OF THE BUILDING OR IS IT THE OTHER WAY AROUND? AND THAT WILL REALLY DEPEND ON WHO THE DEVELOPER IS AND THEIR COMFORT LEVEL AND THE ABILITY TO MANAGE A TAX CREDIT TYPE OF PROPERTY. THERE ARE DEVELOPERS WHO DO TAX CREDIT DEALS AND THEY HAVE IN-HOUSE EXPERTISE AND OTHERS THAT DON'T. SO YOU REALLY HAVE TO HAVE A PROPERTY TAX CREDIT COMPANY ON THAT SIDE, WITH THE INCOME CERTS AND THE STANDARDS FOR THE VARIOUS INVESTORS AND THAT KIND OF THING. SO THOSE THINGS WOULD ALL HAVE TO BE WORKED OUT. WE ARE DEFINITELY NOT AT THAT POINT WHERE WE HAVE THAT WORKED OUT AND THAT'S AGAIN PART OF THE REASON WHY WE THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD TO PREENTITLE THE SITE BEFORE WE GO OUT AND LOOK FOR A PRIVATE DEVELOPER. I HAVE A DEVELOPER I USE RIGHT NOW. THEY DON'T OWN -- THEY WOULDN'T WANT TO OWN AND MANAGE A SITE IN ANN ARBOR. LIKE, THEIR SPECIALTY IS MANAGING THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS THROUGH A LIHTC DEAL. I WOULDN'T FORESEE THEM NECESSARILY BEING THE DEVELOPMENT PARTNER ON THIS. EVEN THOUGH THE HOUSING COMMISSIONER IS PART OF IT, TO GO OUT THROUGH THE RFP OR RFQ PROCESS. A LOT DEPENDS ON WHO THEY RESPOND AND WHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO ACHIEVE ON THEIR OWN SIDE DOES THAT HELP?
00:43:35.466: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES, IT DOES.
00:43:37.267: >> BEFORE YOU PRE-ENTITLE BECAUSE WITH THESE THAT WOULD HAVE THIS APPROACH, THIS PRE-ENTITLEMENT APPROACH, AGAIN, YOU NOTE THAT YOU WOULD ALSO REQUEST DDA FUNDING AND THE INITIAL VERSION OF THE PRESENTATION SLIDES, AND THE ATTACHMENT ON PREDEVELOPMENT COSTS SHOWED THAT SPECIFIC LEVELS OF DDA FUNDING SUPPORT --
00:44:01.859: >> IGNORE THAT.
00:44:02.760: >> Councilmember Lumm: RIGHT. BUT THE FINAL SLIDES WERE CHANGED AND THEY DO NOT SHOW DDA COMMITMENTS AT THIS INTEREST PO. I WONDER -- AT THIS POINT. I WONDER IF YOU CAN CLARIFY WHAT THE DDA'S POSITION IS. YOU MENTIONED IN TERMS OF FUNDING FOR PREDEVELOPMENT OR OTHER COSTS ON THE PROPERTIES THAT ARE IN THE DDA DISTRICT.
00:44:27.251: >> SURE. JUST TO GIVE YOU BACKGROUND ON WHY THE SLIDES ARE DIFFERENT --
00:44:32.990: >> Councilmember Lumm: CHANGED.
00:44:33.657: >> BUT I HAD TO HAVE THIS READY BY JANUARY 2nd AND WE HAD NOT HAD A CHANCE TO MEET AS A GROUP AND I HAD TO PUT SOMETHING DOWN ON PAPER AND AFTER WE TALKED ABOUT IT, WE CAME UP WITH SOME GOOD IDEAS AND BETTER IDEAS AND THAT'S CONSIDER SOME STUFF HAS CHANGED SINCE THE ORIGINAL. SUSAN, DO YOU WANT TO -- THERE YOU ARE.
00:44:53.844: >> MARK NORMAN IS HERE AS WELL. AND HE HAS -- YOU HAD ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT HAS WORKED IN OTHER COMMUNITIES. WE HAVE LOADS OF EXAMPLES. WE ARE HAPPY TO SHARE WHEN WE GET TO THAT LEVEL OF DETAIL BUT HE'S WORKEDN OTHER COMMUNITIES AND CAN YOU CAN TALK ABOUT THAT AS WELL. DO YOU WANT TO FILL THEM IN ABOUT OUR OBSERVATION.
00:45:14.932: >> WE -- OUR CONVERSATION.
00:45:15.666: >> WE HAVE SCHEDULED TIME FOR JENNIFER TO MEET WITH THE DDA. WE AN ON AND OFF PARTNERSHIP. THIS COMING MONTH IS THE DDA-ONLY GROUP. WE HAVE SCHEDULED JENNIFER TO COME AND MEET WITH THE BOARD AND WE WILL SPECIFICALLY ASK A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS IN TERMS OF THE FUNDING FOR THE ELEMENTS THAT YOU ARE PUTTING TO. ONE PIECE OF IT IS THAT DDA HAD IN A -- I GUESS IT WAS JULY OF '18, I THINK IT WAS, THE DDA HAS APPROVED A RESOLUTION ASSIGNING $745,000 TO THE REDEVELOP Y LOT TO ENSURE AFFORDABLE HOUSING LOTS WERE ON SITE. GIVEN THE WORK THAT JENNIFER HAS DONE, IT MAY NOT BE NEEDED FOR THIS SITE TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND SO ONE OF THE ELEMENTS WE WILL TALK TO THE DDA ABOUT IS USING SOME OF THOSE FUNDS FOR OTHER ELEMENTS OF THIS, FOR INSTANCE, SOME OF THE EARLY PREDEVELOPMENT ANALYSES. THE GRANT DOLLARS COULD BE USED IN A VARIETY OF WAYS AND I THINK FOR JENNIFER TO OUTLINE HOW THEY COULD BE USED MOST IMPACTFULLY. WE HAVE THE MEETING SCHEDULED AND I HOPE BY THAT TIME, MAYBE THERE'S ENOUGH DETAIL THAT WE CAN SHOW IN OUR BUDGET LATER ON IN THE SPRING.
00:46:34.244: >> Councilmember Lumm: SO THAT WILL BE REFLECTED -- THE DDA'S RECOMMENDATIONS AND SOME NUMBERS, DOLLAR NUMBERS WILL BE PROVIDED IN ADVANCE OF OR IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE '21 BUDGET IT SOUNDS LIKE THAT?
00:46:49.526: >> YES, THAT'S OUR GOAL SO WE CAN WORK AND PRESENT THAT AS PART OF OUR BUDGET SO YOU KNOW WHAT OUR PLAN WOULD BE. WE WILL BE LEANING ON MR. NORMAN AND JENNIFER HALL TO HELP US UNDERSTAND WHAT THOSE NEEDS MAY BE FROM THE DDA.
00:47:04.041: >> Councilmember Lumm: OKAY.
00:47:04.641: >> WHICH I THINK ARE STILL VING AND TAKING SHAPE.
00:47:09.713: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI AND HAYNER, AND WE CAN SUSPEND QUESTIONS TO ALLOW THE PRESENTATION TO RUN TO ITS CONCLUSION.
00:47:15.018: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE YOU COMING TONIGHT AND PUTTING THIS INFORMATION TOGETHER FOR US. I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE ALL OF THIS LAST WEEK AT THE DDA PARTNERSHIPS COMMITTEE MEETING. SO IT'S GOOD TO GET A SECOND LOOK. WE TALKED ABOUT THE PROPERTY ON ASHLEY STREET.
00:47:39.476: >> 404?
00:47:39.743: >> WITH THE LEASE, WITH U OF M, AND HAS THERE BEEN ANY UPDATE ON THAT IN THE LAST WEEK ABOUT --
00:47:59.730: >> NO.
00:48:00.163: >> M>> Councilmember Ramlawi: MAYBE YOU COULD SHED SOME LIGHT ON THAT. AND SECONDLY WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE Y LOT AND GETTING A PRIVATE DEVELOPER INVOLVED, YOU KNOW, I JUST SPEAK FOR THE COMMUNITY AND FROM A BUSINESS STANDPOINT, THAT THE MORE WE ASK AND THE LESS WE GIVE, THE LESS WE'LL GET. AND I JUST -- WITH THIS SITE, I JUST WANT TO SEE THE MOST -- THEREFORE, THE COMMUNITY AND FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING ADVOCATES AND INTERESTS. IT WILL BE INTERESTING HOW THAT SHAPES OUT AND I'M VERY LEERY ON HAVING A PRIVATE DEVELOPER INVOLVED. ONE OF THE REASONS WAS THE CITY-OWNED LAND, IT SHOULD REMAIN IN PERPETUITY IN THE INTEINTERESTS OF AFFORDABLE HOUG AND KEEPING THAT IN MIND WHEN WE FORM THAT AGREEMENT.
00:49:08.432: >> I WILL TALK ABOUT THE SECOND PART FIRST. ABSOLUTELY 100% AGREE WITH YOU. EVEN THOUGH WE WOULD BE PARTNERING WITH A PRIVATE DEVELOPER, IT WOULD BE MAINTAINED OWNERSHIP WITH THE CITY AND WE WOULD HAVE LONG-TERM AFFORDABLE UNITS. IT'S MORE ABOUT HOW DO YOU DO A MIXED INCOME DEVELOPMENT WHERE THE PRIVATE SECTOR IS BRINGING PRIVATE DOLLARS IN AND PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO WANT TO RESPOND ARE GOING TO HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THOSE RESTRICTIONS UP FRONT. WE WANT TO PUT THEM UP FRONT. LIKE, WE WANT TO PUT THE ENTITLEMENTS UP FRONT. WE WANT TO PUT VERY SPECIFICALLY IN WHATEVER PROCESS WE USE, RFP OR RFQ. HERE'S WHAT WE EXPECT. HERE'S THE RESOURCES WE ARE BRINGING. HERE'S WHAT WE ARE EXPECTING FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND MAKE IT AS VERY SPECIFIC AS POSSIBLE AND NOT HAVE -- IT WOULD BE NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE TEAM, BUT NOT A PUBLIC PROCESS NEGOTIATION IF THAT MAKES SENSE. BUT I DO THINK THAT EACH STEP OF THE WAY, IN THE ENTITLEMENT PROCESS, RFP/RFQ, I WOULD IMAGINE THERE WOULD BE SOME MEMBERS OF SO COUNCIL THAT WANTO BE AN A SELECTION COMMITTEE AND HAVE YOUR INPUT ON EACH STEP OF THE WAY. AND THAT'S THE ADVANTAGE TO HAVING THE HOUSING COMMISSION INVOLVED AS A GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY THAT ANSWERS TO YOU. I WILL BE TRANSPARENT AND BRING STUFF BACK TO YOU AND, YOU KNOW, ASK ME TO SEND YOU INFORMATION, I'M HAPPY TO DO IT AS OPPOSED TO JUST IF AR YOU WERE TO SELL THE PROPERTY TO A PRIVATE PROPERTY, THEY HAVE THEIR OWN INFORMATION. THE FIRST ISSUE ABOUT THE DENTAL CLINIC. WE HAVE ABOUT ONE AND A HALF YEARS LEFT ON THEIR LEASE AND THEY HAVE A CLAUSE THAT WE CAN REQUEST AN ADDITIONAL THREE YEARS AND WHEN WE TALKED TO THEM PRIOR TO THE NOVEMBER COUNCIL MEETING, WE TALKED ABOUT PRYING TO WORK TOGETHER, THAT WE WEREN'T GOING TO JUST ESSENTIALLY EVICT THEM WHEN THEIR ONE AND A HALF YEARS ARE UP. WE WOULD WORK TOGETHER WITH THEM AND SO AFTER THAT MEETING, THEY SAID THEY WOULD VERY LIKELY WANT TO EXTEND THE THREE-YEAR EXTENSION. I SUSPECT THEY REALLY AREN'T GOING TO NEED FOUR AND A HALF YEARS BUT I THINK JUST FOR LACK OF TIME, I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO FOLLOW BACK UP WITH THEM AND SEE WHERE THEY ARE AT ON THEIR THOUGHT PROCESS OF WHAT THEY ARE LOOKING AT. I WOULD IMAGINE THEY WANT TO FIGURE OUT THE BEST LOCATION FOR A NEW SITE. THEY HAVE GOT THE NEW DENTAL SCHOOL. THEY MIGHT BE EXPLORING PUTTING IT IN THE NEW DENTAL SCHOOL. I DON'T KNOW. I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE MORE CONVERSATION AND THEN REPORT BACK TO YOU.
00:52:14.050: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
00:52:14.985: >> Councilmember Hayner:  WE TALK ABOUT ENTITLING LIKE THE KLEIN LOT. I KNOW AS COUNCILMAN RAMLAWI WHEN YOU PUT THE ENTITLEMENTS AND SOME VIEW THEM AS RESTRICTIONS, THAT IT MIGHT DECREASE THE VALUE, BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE WORTH IT TO GET THE TYPE OF STRUCTURES ON THESE PROPERTIES. WE HAD SOME VERY INTERESTING FINANCING METHODS, WAYS TO ENCOURAGE PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT AND USING PUBLIC ENCOURAGEMENT. WE MIGHT HAVE SOME PARCEL SALES. IT'S A DYNAMIC RAND LANDSCAPE, T IT'S REALLY INTERESTING LOOK AT HOW TO AFFORD THIS, HOW CAN THE CITY AFFORD THIS AND HOW CAN THE CITY PUT THE LEAST AMOUNT OF MONEY AND HAVE THE BEST RESULTS. I THANK YOU FOR DOING ALL OF THAT WORK ON HERE. WHAT TYPE OF ENTITLEMENTS WILL BE PUT ON THE KLEIN'S LOT BEFORE IT WAS SOLD? COMMITMENTS TO AFFORDABILITY OR WHAT?
00:53:28.925: >> MY PERSONAL VIEW -- AND I WILL TALK ENTITLEMENTS.
00:53:35.198: >> Councilmember Hayner:  WHAT IS LAWFUL?
00:53:36.466: >> TO GENERATE FUNDS FOR AT OTHER SITES THAT WE SHOULD NOT PUT ANY RESTRICTIONS ON IT.
00:53:47.243: >> I AGREE. IT DEPENDS ON THE GOALS FOR IT. ARE YOU LOOKING FOR GOALS TO BE MET. ALTERNATIVELY, IF YOU WANTED TO PRE-ENTITLE IT TO ADD FINANCIAL VALUE, IT WOULD PROBABLY HAVE MORE VALUE FOR SOMEONE TO BUY IT AND KNOW THAT THEY, ON DAY ONE, THEY COULD START CONSTRUCTING SOMETHING. HOWEVER, IF THE OVERALL GOAL WAS LESS SPECIFIC ABOUT AFFORDABLE UNITS OR OTHER COMMUNITY GOALS, THEN THE SORT OF GOAL TO PREENTITLE IT MIGHT BE LESS. IT MIGHT BE LESS OF A VALUE FOR THAT RFP PROCESS.
00:54:26.649: >> Councilmember Hayner: OKAY. LIKE 721. YOU MENTIONED THAT THERE'S SOME THINGS ON THAT PROPERTY THAT ARE -- IT'S JUST -- THE ENTITLEMENT WOULD INCLUDE YOU CAN'T DEVELOP HERE, THOSE TYPE OF RESTRICTIONS, RIGHT?
00:54:37.894: >> YEAH. AND, AGAIN, THINK OF -- THIS IS A VALUE FOR A SITE BEING READY TO GO FOR A DEVELOPER. ONCE THEY INVEST, THE TRANSFER TO REALIZATION ON A FASTER BASIS IS A BENEFIT. WE WANT TO SEE WHERE WE CAN ADD VALUE OR WHETHER IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO TAKE THAT STEP.
00:55:03.920: >> Councilmember Hayner:  AND BECAUSE THIS IS PUBLIC LAND AND THEY ARE NOT PARKS, THERE'S NO ISSUE AROUND SELLING THIS LAND OUTSIDE OF PUBLIC DISCUSSION?
00:55:12.362: >> THEY ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS
00:55:15.632: >> Councilmember Eaton: MR. MAYO R, I HAVE A REALLY QUICK QUESTION.
00:55:18.401: >> Mayor Taylor: IT'S ALL YOU.
00:55:19.169: >> Councilmember Eaton: YOUR NOTES ON 350 SOUTH 5th IT SAYS THERE ARE NO NEGATIVE SITE ISSUES.
00:55:27.844: >> MM-HMM.
00:55:28.845: >> Councilmember Eaton: AWARE THAT THERE ARE BROWNFIELD ISSUES AT THAT SITE?
00:55:32.549: >> WE CONSIDER THAT A POSITIVE BECAUSE YOU CAN USE BROWNFIELD FUNDING ON THAT SITE ALSO.
00:55:39.022: >> Councilmember Eaton: OKAY.
00:55:39.756: >> ON THE APPRAISING WE GOT BACK FOR ASH -- SOUTH ASHLEY, THEY APPRAISED IT AS A SITE WITH AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND THE D1 BONUS AND THEY DID IT WITHOUT ANY AFFORDABLE HOUSE AND THE D1 BONUS AND THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING, APPRAISAL CAME IN LOWER THAN THE APPRAISAL AMOUNT DID WITH NO AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS.
00:56:12.789: >> Councilmember Hayner: THAT'S CURRENTLY ZONED D1 OR D2?
00:56:20.864: >> D1.
00:56:21.097: >> Councilmember Hayner:  SO MUCH FOR TRANSITIONAL HOUSING.
00:56:25.001: >> THERE HAS A LOT MORE DETAIL, BUT IT'S BA BASICALLY LOOKING AT DIFFERENT WAYS TO DEVELOP. WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT ALL OF THESE SO FAR. SO I WILL MOVE ON. AND THIS IS THE SLIDE THAT JANE WAS TALKING ABOUT REGARDING LOCAL IF  FINANCIAL SUPPORT. FOR FISCAL YEAR '20, THE YEAR THAT WE ARE, IN WE ARE LOOKING AT TALKING TO, AGAIN, THE DDA ABOUT COULD WE EXPAND OUR COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT PROCESS, AND TECHNICALLY IT WOULD PROBABLY END UP BEING IN FISCAL YEAR '21 AND NOT FISCAL YEAR '20. THERE WERE FOUR SITES FOR 125, JUST FOR COMPARATIVE. THEY DID WEST WASHINGTON AND THE Y, IT WAS 150,000. BUT THEY HAVE ALREADY PUT IN SO MUCH LEG WORK. WE SPENT HUNDREDS OF HOURS WITH THEM, DEVELOPING THE TOOLS FOR COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT, THE WEBSITE, THE SURVEYS. SO IT WOULD ACTUALLY BE MUCH MORE FINANCIALLY FEASIBLE IF THEY CONTINUED AND AMENDED AND CONTINUED THAT PROCESS, AND SENT IT OUT FOR NEW RFP. WE ARE ALSO RECOMMENDED AND IF SUSAN WOULD LIKE TO COME UP. WE ARE ALSO RECOMMENDING THAT WE TALK TO THE DDA ABOUT DOING A DOWNTOWN PARKING ANALYSIS.
00:57:43.980: >> WE HAD SOME INITIAL CONVERSATIONS AROUND 4th AND CATHERINE. A LOT OF CONCERN HAS BEEN RAISED AROUND PARKING. AND SO IF THERE WAS AN INTEREST IN ENGAGING WITH THE COMMUNITY, INCLUDING THE SITE, WE WOULD WANT TO SIT DOWN AND TALK ABOUT WHAT A STUDY COULD HELP US FIND OUT. JUST TO UNDERSTAND HOW BEST TO RESPOND TO THAT CONCERN. FOR INSTANCE, IN 2015, THE DDA DID DID A PARKING SUPPLY AND DEMAND STUDY AND THAT COULD BE UPDATED. THAT LOOKED AT THE FULL WEEK TO UNDERSTAND WHEN DEMAND WAS HAPPENING, HOW MUCH DEMAND WAS HAPPENING, INFORMATION ABOUT PEAK, WHICH WAS MIDWEEK AND FRIDAY NIGHTS. WE CAN TRY TO UNDERSTAND IMPACTS OF PARKING VERSUS PEOPLE LIVING ON THAT SITE THIS WAS A QUESTION THAT CAME UP AT THE PARTNERSHIPS COMMITTEE. IF IT WAS POSSIBLE, IT WOULD BE GREAT TO ANALYZE. IF YOU HAD 60 PEOPLE LIVING ON THE 4th AND CATHERINE LOT, THEIR BUYING POWER, VERSUS PEOPLE COMING IN AND OUT DURING THE WEEK. IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO UNDERSTAND IF ANYBODY HAS BENCHMARKED THAT AROUND THE COUNTRY. TRYING TO UNDERSTAND AS MUCH ABOUT PARKING AS WE COULD. WE TAKE TO HEART THE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED AND WE TRY TO UNDERSTAND IT BETTER.
00:59:11.734: >> I THINK THE REST OF THIS IS SELF-EXPLANATORY. AND WE HAVE -- GO AHEAD. OKAY. THESE ARE SOME OTHER WAYS THAT THE DDA WOULD BE INVOLVED, IN ADDITION TO PARKING, THEY WOULD HELP WITH THE INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS, THE WATER, THE SEWER, THE SIDEWALK, THE AREAS THAT COULD DEFRAY THE COST OF A DOWNTOWN PARKING LOT. I WON'T SAY THAT WE WON'T COME BACK FOR MORE MONEY AT THE Y SITE. WE THINK THE $745,000 WOULD BE BETTER UTILIZED AT THIS STAGE OF PROCESS THAN HOLDING ON TO IT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT PART. AND THEN THE CITY HAS BROWNFIELD FUNDING, BOTH GRANTS, TIF, WE COULD SELL THE PROPERTY, AND THERE'S SUSTAINABILITY FUNDS. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH DR. STOLTZ AND HER DEPARTMENT WE HAD THIS DISCUSSION IN NOVEMBER ABOUT TRYING TO AT MINIMUM REACH NET ZERO, IF NOT CARBON NEUTRALITY. WE ARE CONTINUING THOSE DISCUSSIONS TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO. LATER ON, WE CAN TALK ABOUT BONDS OR MILLAGE. IS THAT WHERE YOU WANTED TO STOP? THE NEXT SLIDE IS SPECIFIC TO THE HOUSING COMMISSION. THERE WERE A LOT OF SITE THAT WE RECOMMENDED THAT WE DO THE DEVELOPMENT WHICH IS A LOT OF WORK AS YOU CAN IMAGINE. I'M THE ONE DOING IT ALL. I'M DOING THE ALL THE WORK UNDER THE DEVELOPMENT OF OPERATIONS AND DIRECTOR MANAGEMENT RIGHT NOW. I BELIEVE THAT IF WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE ADDING MORE SITES, I NEED SOMEBODY DEDICATED TO MANAGING ALL OF THOSE FUNDS IN THE REGULATIONS ON OUR ASSETS. AND BE THE QUALITY CONTROL PERSON. SO IN THE FISCAL YEAR '21 BUDGE ELIMINATE, I WILL BE REQUEST -- BUDGET, I WILL BE REQUESTING AN FTE THAT WE CAN FUND WITH OUR OWN FUNDING. I'M NOT ASKING FOR GENERAL FUNDS FOR THAT POSITION, BUT I DO NEED SOME KIND OF HELP ON THE DEVELOPMENT SIDE. YES, I WOULD HAVE A DEVELOPER, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN I HAVE TO MAKE 10,000 DECISIONS AND GO TO MANY, MANY MEETINGS THAT THE PRIVE A DEVELOPER WOULD NOT BE WHOLLY RESPONSIBLE FOR. SO I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A NEW POSITION OR HIRE A CONSULTANT. THE CONSULTANTS WILL RUN $200 AN HOUR ROUGHLY, AND A NEW FULL-TIME POSITION IS PROBABLY LESS THAN $100 AN HOUR, BUT THAT'S A LONG-TERM COMMITMENT AS OPPOSED TO A SHORT-TERM COMMITMENT. WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PAY FOR THAT FOR THE FIRST COUPLE OF YEARS BUT ONCE WE HAVE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS HAPPENING, WE CAN USE OUR DEVELOPER FEE TO PAY FOR THAT PERSON'S COST, WHETHER IT'S A STAFF PERSON OR WHETHER IT'S A CONSULTANT. WE JUST NEED SOME HELP AT THE BEGINNING FOR TWO YEARS. WE DON'T NEED IT AT '22. WE CAN'T DEVELOP THAT QUICKLY. AT SOME POINT, WHEN THE PROJECTS COME ONLINE, THEY HAVE TO MAINTAIN MAINTENANCE, AND THAT GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF WHAT TYPE OF STAFFING IS NEEDED BASED ON HOW MANY NEW UNITS ARE ADDED. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO TALK SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THIS SLIDE. IT WAS REALLY JUST SOME IDEAS THAT WERE GENERATED THROUGH OUR COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT PROCESS, PARKING CAME UP A LOT, AS YOU CAN IMAGINE, BECAUSE THERE WAS QUITE A FEW DOWNTOWN SURFACE PARKING LOTS THAT WE ARE ANALYZING AND THIS IS WHAT LED TO US COMING UP WITH THE IDEA OF DON'T WE DO A MORE BROADER PARKING STUDY AND THEN BRING THAT BACK TO CITY COUNCIL AND V HAVE FRESHER AND DIFFERENT PARKING IDEAS. THERE WAS ONE PERSON WHO SUGGESTED -- A COUPLE CAME IN AND THEY SUGGESTED THAT THE ANN ARBOR RAILROAD ONLY HAS ONE RAILCAR EVERY 24 HOURS THAT GOES DOWN THAT ELECTRONIC, WHICH GOES PAST INDUSTRIAL TO THE DOWNTOWN AND GOES OUT TO NORTH CAMPUS AND THEY HAD JUST COME BACK FROM A TRIP FROM SOMEWHERE DOWN SOUTH WHERE THEY HAD AS A COMMUNITY CREATED A TROLLEY THAT THE OTHER 23 HOURS OF THE DAY, THAT WASN'T BEING USED BY THE RAILROAD, THEY ACTUALLY HAD A TROLLEY GOING IN AND OUT OF THE DOWNTOWN. I THOUGHT THAT WAS AN AMAZING IDEA. SO I'M JUST PUTTING IT OUT THERE AS A POSSIBILITY.
01:04:00.756: >> Councilmember Ackerman: ARE YOU LOOKING FOR A MOTION? [ LAUGHTER ]
01:04:04.961: >> DID THEY HAVE TO PUT A SPUR IN OR SOMETHING?
01:04:10.099: >> THEY PUT A SPUR IN FOR THE TIME WHEN THE TRACK --
01:04:14.203: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  IF YOU NEED SOMEONE TO SOMEONE TO HAND PUMP IT.
01:04:21.811: >> ALL RIGHT WE WILL WORK ON IT. WE WILL TALK TO ELI. NOW WE ARE TALKING ABOUT MONEY. WE HAVE THE POTENTIAL BOND FUNDING THAT COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER MENTIONED EARLIER TODAY BUT THERE'S HOUSING REVENUE BONDS AND I TALKED TO TOM CRAWFORD AFTER THE MEETING AND WE WILL KEEP ON HAVING THAT CONVERSATION AND THIS IS REALLY FOR SITES THAT WE CANNOT USE TAX CREDITS, SUCH AS SOUTH INDUSTRIAL. SO THAT'S ALREADY ON THE ANALYSIS PART OF THE DISCUSSION. I HEARD THAT THERE ARE FOLKS MEETING WITH COUNCILMEMBERS ABOUT POTENTIAL MILLAGE. AND THIS IS A VERY FLEXIBLE SOURCE OF FUNDING WITH LOW REGULATORY BURDEN AND YOU CAN USE IT FOR SUPPORTIVE SERVICES AND YOU CAN ALSO USE IT FOR ACQUISITION. SO IT'S VERY FLEXIBLE, IF THAT'S A ROUTE THAT COUNCIL WANTS TO TAKE. THIS IS JUST INFORMATION. IT REMINDS US, I OWE ALI THE RESULTS OF THE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT PROCESS. I DON'T THINK I ATTACHED IT TO TONIGHT'S AGENDA. I WILL MAKE SURE I SEND IT OUT. WE DID A SURVEY OF OUR OWN TENANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEREVER WE BUILT A NEW PLACE, IT MADE SENSE. AND THIS IS KIND OF THE RESULTS EVER IT AND I ACTUALLY, I WILL TALK TO THE U OF M ABOUT SEEING IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THEY MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER DOING FOR THEIR OWN SITE TO KIND OF UNDERSTAND WHERE THEIR PATIENTS ARE AT AND HOW THEY GET TO THEIR LOCATION. IT MAY TURN OUT THAT BEING DOWNTOWN IS NOT NECESSARILY THE MOST CONVENIENT PLACE FOR FOLKS TO GO TO. STEPS GOING FORWARD, MARCH 2020. BUT IT'S HOW QUICKLY WE CAN GET STUFF ON THE COUNCIL AGENDA. WE WANT TO BRING A RESOLUTION TO DO COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AT 355 SOUTH MAIN AND INCLUDING A CONTRACT WITH THE SMITH GROUP FOR SOUTH MAIN -- I'M SORRY, NORTH MAIN AND THE ASHLEY PARKING LOT, AND WE WILL BE RECOMMENDING THAT THE CATHERINE LOT ALSO BE INCLUDED. THE -- PROBABLY AROUND MAY, WHEN THE BUDGET MEETING HAPPENS, THAT'S WHERE WE WILL BE TALKING ABOUT PREDEVELOPMENT FUNDING, BOTH ON THE DDA SIDE, AS WELL AS FROM THE ANN ARBOR HOUSING FUND. THE FTE FOR AN ASSET MANAGER AND THEN FIGURING OUT HOW TO GET HELP WITH DEVELOPMENT. AND THEN POSSIBLY YET THIS CALENDAR YEAR, BUT MORE LIKELY EARLY NEXT YEAR, WOULD BE THE FIRST ACTUAL VOTING ON THE FINAL PRE-ENTITLEMENT-TYPE PLANS BUT THERE WILL BE PLENTY OF DISCUSSIONS IN BETWEEN NOW AND THEN. OKAY. THAT'S IT FOR MY PART OF THE DISCUSSION.
01:07:24.093: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION? [ OFF MICROPHONE COMMENTS ]
01:07:40.809: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU. WHETHER YOU AGREE WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS OR NOT, YOU PROVIDED A SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE LOGICAL AND REALISTIC, I THINK, BUT, YOU KNOW, WE WILL HAVE, OF COURSE, LOTS OF QUESTION TO COME. AND, IN FACT, ON THE LAST SLIDE, RIGHT, WHERE YOU HAVE MAY 2020 COUNCIL FISCAL '21 BUDGET MEETING, I'M ASSUMING THAT THAT'S NOT -- BECAUSE MAY IS WHEN WE APPROVE THE BUDGET. WE ACTUALLY GET THE ADMINISTRATOR'S BUDGET IN APRIL. SO THAT THESE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ONE FTE FOR THE ASSET MANAGER AND THEN THE FUNDING FOR THE DEVELOPMENT CONSULTANT, ET CETERA, ET CETERA, THAT THOSE ARE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT YOU ARE NOW MAKING TO THE ADMINISTRATOR AND HIS BUDGET MAY OR MAY NOT REFLECT THAT BUT THAT WILL COME TO US IN APRIL, BASICALLY.
01:08:31.727: >> YES.
01:08:32.027: >> Councilmember Lumm: OKAY. GOOD. PARKING CAPACITY OVERALL QUESTION. SO THANK YOU FOR A SLIDE ON PARKING. AS YOU KNOW NOW, I BELIEVE WE NEED A PARKING PLAN. BY NOT REPR REPLACING THESE SURE LOT PROPERTIES IT WOULD BE DISASTROUS FOR OUR BUSINESSES. I DID GO TO THE KERRYTOWN MEETING LAST WEEK AND I SAW SOME OF YOUR THOUGHTFUL RESPONSES IN RESPONSE TO THEIR CONCERNS. THANK YOU FOR THAT. OBVIOUSLY YOU ARE AWARE OF THEIR CONCERNS, BUT -- AND SO I FULLY SUPPORT CONDUCTING A PARKING STUDY. I HAVE A COUPLE OF SPECIFIC QUESTIONS RELATED TO PARKING. ONE, IS THERE A PLAN, TO BRING IN ASHLEY LOT EXPANSION BACK TO COUNCIL FOR CONSIDERATION? THAT WAS ASKED BY A COUPLE OF FOLKS AT THIS KERRYTOWN MEETING LAST WEEK. I THINK NOW THAT WE HAVE TAKEN A DEEP DIVE INTO POTENTIAL AFFORDABLE HOUSING SITES AND BETTER -- AND WE BETTER UNDERSTAND THE ADVERSE IMPACTS OF DOWNTOWN PARKING CAPACITY, I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE THERE'S SUPPORT FOR THAT EXPANSION.
01:09:57.680: >> CERTAINLY THERE WERE MANY COMMENTS, PROS AND CON, ABOUT THAT PROJECT. ONE ELEMENT, THOUGH, THAT DOES RESONATE IS AT LEAST FOR SOME MEMBERS OF COUNCIL, BETTER CONNECTING THAT EXPANSION TO A GOAL OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING.
01:10:11.593: >> Councilmember Lumm: RIGHT.
01:10:12.328: >> THAT TO BE TALKING MORE GENERALLY AROUND DEVELOPMENT WAS NOT RESONATING BUT AT LEAST FOR SOME, WHAT I HEARD AN INTEREST IN CONNECTING THAT PROJECT. AND JUST CATHERINE IS TWO BLOCKS AWAY. AND IF WE CAN DO SOMETHING TO IMPROVE THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD --
01:10:30.612: >> Councilmember Lumm: RIGHT.
01:10:31.246: >> I THINK IT'S ALL BENEFICIAL.
01:10:33.615: >> Councilmember Lumm: RIGHT. SO THAT MAY COME BACK NOW THAT YOU ARE CONNECTING THESE OTHER DOTS.
01:10:39.888: >> YEAH.
01:10:40.155: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANKS. REGARDLESS OF WHETHER -- OH, TOO FAR. THE KLEIN'S LOT IS SOLD FOR MARKET DEVELOPMENT OR DEVELOPED WITH AFFORDABLE HOUSING, THE 144 SPACES THERE ARE LOST, AND I THINK THE POSSIBILITY OF -- IT'S BEEN RAISED ABOUT THE PARKING STRUCTURE FIRST AND WILLIAM, IS AN INTRIGUING POSSIBILITY. AND IT MIGHT MAKE PAY LOT OF SENSE, AND IS THIS ALL -- SOMETHING THE DDA IS LEGITIMATELY LOOKING AT OR IS IT JUST A -- I DON'T KNOW, A BRAINSTORM KIND OF AN IDEA?
01:11:16.458: >> SO I WOULD CHANGE THE VERB FROM "LOOKING AT" TO "LISTENING." THERE'S SO MUCH THAT SHOULD BE DECIDED THAT WOULD IMPEL US -- THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF PARKING SHOULD FOLLOW OUR COURSE OF ACTION. WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO DO? AND IF THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING SIGNIFICANT TO MEET COMMUNITY GOALS AROUND HOUSING AFFORDABILITY AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING, THE PARKING CAN FOLLOW THAT. WE ARE LISTENING. AS I SAID EARLIER AROUND THE STUDY OF PARKING, HEARING VERY SERIOUSLY THE CONCERNS THAT PEOPLE HAVE AND THE BETTER WE UNDERSTAND WHAT THE CONCERNS ARE AND THE BETTER WE UNDERSTAND WHAT THE OPTIONS MIGHT BE, AND HOW TO RESPOND TO IT.
01:11:55.764: >> Councilmember Lumm: MM-HMM.
01:11:56.532: >> RIGHT NOW WE ARE LISTENING, HOW PARKING CAN BE PLANNED, WE'LL HAVE TO FOLLOW AFTER WE KNOW WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO.
01:12:03.172: >> Councilmember Lumm: OKAY. IN TERMS OF LISTENING, I WOULD ALSO SHARE THAT AT THAT KERRYTOWN MEETING LAST WEEK, IT WAS NOTED THAT THE NELSON NIGARD STUDY HAD INDICATED AND FOUND THAT THE KERRYTOWN AREA WAS PARKING CHALLENGED WHEN THAT STUDY WAS CONDUCTED. SO IT WAS JUST AN OBSERVATION. SO -- AND, AGAIN, AS YOU ARE WELL AWARE, THIS WAS A LOT OF DISCUSSION AT THAT MEETING, REGARDING DEVELOPING THE 51 SPACES THERE. AND OF COURSE, WE RECEIVED AN EMAIL ABOUT THIS FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE KERRYTOWN DISTRICT ASSOCIATION TODAY, REFLECTING THEIR CONCERNS, ALSO A STUDY THAT WAS CONDUCTED THAT SHOWED LESS THAN A THIRD OF THE KERRYTOWN SHOPPERS LIVE IN ANN ARBOR. I THINK THAT'S PRETTY COMPELLING INFORMATION. THE SHOPPERS DRIVE. THEY NEED TO PARK. AND I THINK THEIR CONCERN IS VALID. SO I FOR ONE AGREE WITH MS. SINGLETON THAT WE SHOULD CONTINUE THE COMMUNITY DIALOGUE. MANY PEOPLE SAID -- YOU KNOW, THEY WERE VERY DISTRESSED THAT WE -- THAT THEY WERE NOT CONTACTACTED BEFORE THAT RECOMMENDATION CAME TO US, AND SO IS GREAT NEED FOR COMMUNITY DIALOGUE REGARDING DEVELOPING THAT SURFACE LOT. THE KERRYTOWN FOLKS, IN MY VIEW, THEY ARE SUPPORTIVE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND THE ISSUE IS THE LOST PARKING. AND THAT WE SHOULD LOOK AT OPTIONS FOR ADDRESSING PARKING OR FRANKLY, WE'LL PUT SOME OF THESE BUSINESSES AT RISK. AND NONE OF US WANTS THAT, OBVIOUSLY. AND I'M ALSO WONDERING, IN TERMS OF THE -- ON THE PARKING SLIDE, AGAIN, THE KERRYTOWN ASSOCIATION, YOU KNOW, THEY FLOATED SOME IDEAS AS WELL. OBVIOUSLY, WE NEED TO TAKE THE TIME TO GET THIS RIGHT. BUT ONE IDEA THAT WAS BROUGHT UP BEFORE WAS POSSIBLY UTILIZING THE COUNTY LOT, THE COUNTY EMPLOYEE PARKING LOT ACROSS THE STREET FOR PUBLIC PARKING. THE COUNTY IS AWARE OF THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING NEED. I'M WONDERING IF WE TALKED TO THE COUNTY ABOUT THIS. AND WHAT THE RESPONSE HAS BEEN IF WE TALKED TO THEM.
01:14:23.211: >> I WAS GOING TO SAY JUST CURRENTLY THE COUNTY VERY GENEROUSLY PROVIDES THEIR LOT FOR FREE FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO PARK. THAT'S THE COUNTY LOT AT 4 4th AND CATHERINE.
01:14:33.255: >> Councilmember Lumm: MM-HMM.
01:14:36.058: >> HI, GOOD EVENING. SO THE COUNTY IS DEFINITELY AWARE OF THE STUDY, AND IS ACTUALLY GOING TO TAKE OVER THE FIRST QUARTER OF THE YEAR, LOOK AT ITS DOWNTOWN SPACE NEEDS TO SEE IF WE CAN LOOK AT ANY OF THE THREE COUNTY PARKING LOTS THAT ARE DOWNTOWN FOR SIMILAR FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS. BUT IN THE FIRST QUARTER, WE WILL LOOK AT NEEDS FIRST AND WE WOULDN'T BE READY TO JOIN IN UNTIL PROBABLY SECOND QUARTER.
01:14:57.145: >> Councilmember Lumm: OKAY. THANKS.
01:15:02.618: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
01:15:05.253: >> Councilmember Griswold: THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THIS VERY PROFESSIONAL ANALYSIS AND I WANT TO ECHO WHAT MY COLLEAGUE IN THE SECOND WARD, COUNCILMEMBER LUMM STATED. I HAVE A FEW COMMENTS ON INDIVIDUAL SITES AND THEN ALSO -- BUT FIRST, I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE MILLAGE. I THINK THAT THE MILLAGE IS REALLY COUNTER PRODUCTIVE. IF YOU ARE TAXING PEOPLE WHO ARE MAKING LESS THAN 60% OF A.M.I., SUCH AS ON FIXED INCOMES, TO TRY TO PROVIDE HOUSING, AND SUPPLEMENT HOUSING FOR PEOPLE AT GREATER THAN 60% A.M.I. I MEAN IT GETS VERY, VERY COMPLEX, AND IF WE ARE PROVIDING HOUSING, SAY, FOR U OF M NURSES, MAKING CLOSE TO 60,000, IS THE REAL ARGUMENT NOT TAXING PEOPLE ON FIXED INCOMES BUT WORKING WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN SO THAT THEY PAY AN APPROPRIATE WAGE TO THEIR STAFF? SO I DON'T EXPECT AN ANSWER THERE, BUT IT IS VERY COMPLEX AND WE NEED TO BE VERY CAREFUL AND I WOULD ONLY CONSIDER A MILLAGE IF WE HAD TRIED EVERY POSSIBLE OPTION AND WE WERE FIVE YEARS DOWN THE LINE AND WE WERE STOPPED. I ATTENDED THAT MEETING AT 4:00 TODAY, AND I WAS -- I LEFT THERE REALLY EXCITED THAT WE DO HAVE OPTIONS FOR FINANCING CREATIVELY. NOW A FEW OF MY ISSUES, 404 ASHLEY, I USED TO BE THE COMMUNITY DENTAL CENTER BOARD AND I REA HOPE WE CAN DO SOME TYPE OF MIXED USE ON THAT, AND POSSIBLY HAVE THE COMMUNITY DENTAL CENTER RETURN TO THAT BUILDING OR SOMEWHERE NEARBY BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST PART OF THE DENTAL SCHOOL. IT ACTUALLY IS A BENEFIT FOR THE COMMUNITY THERE. 1501 EAST STADIUM, IT'S ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE STREET AND I THINK THAT'S A PERFECT OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A MIDRISE, POSSIBLY ON A MIDRISE WHERE THE PARKING IS IN THE BACK. BUILDING RIGHT NOW. SO I'M NOT AN ARCHITECT, BUT POSSIBLY THAT'S BEEN CONSIDERED AND WE HEAR SO MUCH ABOUT TALL BUILDING SHADOWS AND THAT'S A CASE WHERE THE ONLY SHADOW WOULD BE ON STADIUM AND IT WOULDN'T NEGATIVELY IMPACT ANY RESIDENTS. 121 NORTH CATHERINE, I THINK THAT WE HAVE LEARNED THAT WE REALLY DO NEED MORE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND I APOLOGIZE. THAT WAS PROBABLY A MISSTEP. WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO BE AMBITIOUS IN OUR GOALS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND SO WE MAY HAVE A FEW MISSTEPS. WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT IS THAT WE REMAIN FLEXIBLE AND WHEN WE ENCOUNTER AN ISSUE, WE'RE WILLING TO STEP BACK AND TAKE CORRECTIVE ACTION. AND I BELIEVE WE ARE GOING TO DO THAT. 350 SOUTH 5th, I REALLY HOPE WE CAN WORK WITH AAATA, I'M SO EMBARRASSED THAT WE HAVE BUSES LOADING AND UNLOADING ON THE STREET. I JUST THINK THAT SENDS A REALLY BAD MESSAGE TO OUR VISITORS TO ANN ARBOR. WE REALLY CONSIDER DO BETTER THAN THAT, AND WE SHOULD. DOWNTOWN PARKING ANALYSIS. I THINK THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT NOT ONLY PARKING DEMAND, BUT HOW CAN WE REDUCE PARKING DEMAND, NOT JUST PROVIDE MORE PARKING. AND I HOPE THAT THIS PARKING ANALYSIS IS CITYWIDE, NOT JUST THE DOWNTOWN BECAUSE PARKING IS A CITY ISSUE AND I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE MORE PARK AND RIDE LOTS AND A WAY TO INCENTIVIZE GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES PARKING IN THOSE PARK AND RIDE LOTS A MAJORITY OF THE TIME THAT. WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY FREE UP SOME PARKING SPACES. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AGAIN, IT WAS VERY PROFESSIONAL AND I REMAIN OPTIMISTIC.
01:19:08.330: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OR QUEST QUESTIONS. COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
01:19:22.844: >> Councilmember Eaton: I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BEING SO SENSITIVE ABOUT THE CONCERNS ABOUT THE CATHERINE AND 4 4th PARKING LOT. I WANT TO VOICE MY HESITANCY TO SUPPORT MILLAGE. I -- ONE OF THE THINGS I HEAR MOST FROM MY CONSTITUENTS IS THAT TAXING PEOPLE WHO ARE ON A FIXED INCOME TO SUPPORT OTHER PEOPLE'S HOUSING NEEDS IS --
01:19:48.970: >> Councilmember Lumm: DRIVING THEM OUT OF ANN ARBOR.
01:19:51.006: >> Councilmember Eaton: IT'S CAUSING A HOUSING PROBLEM FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE REALLY STRUGGLING TO AFFORD OUR TAXES AND FEES IN THIS TOWN, BUT OTHERWISE, I REALLY APPRECIATE EVERYTHING THAT YOU HAVE DONE HERE. THANK YOU.
01:20:02.417: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER QUESTIONS? YES, I HAVE A COUPLE. CAN YOU -- THIS IS PROBABLY IN SOME SLIDE OR I COULD PROBABLY FIGURE IT OUT IF I JUST ADDED IT AND LOOKED BACK AND FORTH. WHAT IS THE RANGE OF UNITS IF WE -- YOU KNOW, IF WE HIT A BUNCH OF DOUBLES AND TRIPLES, YOU KNOW, ON THE PARCELS THAT WE HAVE UNDER CONSIDERATION?
01:20:28.343: >> I THINK --
01:20:29.344: >> Mayor Taylor: WHAT IS THE BALLPARK?
01:20:30.312: >> I WANT TO SAY IF WE DEVELOPED EVERY SITE, IN THE HIGH END OF THE RANGE, IT WAS SOMEWHERE AROUND 1600 UNITS. DOES THAT SOUND FAMILIAR TO YOU GUYS? 1600 TO 14 UNUNITS IF ALL THE SITES WERE DEVELOPED.
01:20:49.030: >> Mayor Taylor: ALL RIGHT. AND IS THAT -- ARE THOSE -- THOSE ARE UNITS OF -- BECAUSE SOME OF THESE --
01:20:54.035: >> A MIXTURE. THAT WOULD BE A MIXTURE OF MARKET RATE AND AFFORDABLE.
01:20:59.307: >> Mayor Taylor: YES. UNDERSTOOD.
01:21:02.344: >> I CAN'T REMEMBER OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD.
01:21:06.281: >> Mayor Taylor: ISH? 1,000 PLUS OR MINUS?
01:21:08.550: >> BECAUSE THERE WERE A COUPLE OF REALLY BIG SITES, SOUTH ASHLEY WHICH IS A LOT OF MARKET RATE. I WANT TO SAY MAYBE HALF WERE AFFORDABLE.
01:21:16.458: >> Mayor Taylor: ALL RIGHT.
01:21:17.058: >> IF WE COULD DEVELOP EVERY SITE.
01:21:19.227: >> Mayor Taylor: UNDERSTOOD.
01:21:19.828: >> AND THE OTHER ONES THAT WERE MARKET WERE AT THE REALLY LARGE, OR LIKE 721 NORTH MAIN OR WEST WASHINGTON, WE ARE NOT SURE WHAT WE CAN DO THERE.
01:21:29.704: >> Mayor Taylor: ALL RIGHT. I GUESS -- FIRST OFF, I WOULD LIKE TO ECHO WHAT MY COLLEAGUES ON COUNCIL HAD TO SAY WITH RESPECT TO THE SCOPE AND THE WORK DONE BY YOURSELF AND THE FOLKS WITH WHOM YOU ARE WORKING. IT'S -- IT'S EXCELLENT. IT'S CLEAR. AND, YOU KNOW, I'M GLAD WE ARE TAKING THIS IMPORTANT STEPS. WITH RESPECT TO THE Y LOT, I WOULD LIKE TO ECHO MY COUNCIL COLLEAGUES' YOU KNOW, EAGERNESS FOR US TO COOPERATE WITH AAATA, HOW WE CAN MAKE THAT, YOU KNOW -- I THINK WE ALL WANT FEWER CARS DOWNTOWN. ONE WAY TO HAVE FEWER CARS DOWNTOWN IS TO HAVE MORE BUSES COME THROUGH DOWNTOWN AND IF WE CAN WORK WITH THAT SITE, I WOULD NOT -- LET ME STATE IT IN THE AFFIRMATIVE, I WOULD BE DELIGHTED IF WE HAD SOME AIR RIGHTS OVER THE AAATA PARCEL AT THIS JUNCTURE AND GET MORE BUSES INTO THE LOCATION AS A WHOLE. THAT, I THINK WOULD BE AN EXCELLENT SOLUTION, I'M SURE ENGINEERS COULD TELL WHETHER IT WORKS OR DOESN'T WORK. BUT, YOU KNOW, SITTING HERE AT THE TABLE, I CAN DREAM AND I'M DREAMING ABOUT IT. AND I GUESS I WOULD SAY TOO, UNDERSTANDING THAT, YOU KNOW -- AND I'M GLAD THAT WE HAVE EXPANDED OUR ENGAGEMENT WITH RESPECT TO ISSUES OF PARKING BUT I WOULD ALSO SAY, THAT FOR MY PART, THE FACT THAT THERE ARE TRADEOFFS FOR THE USE -- OUR CURRENT USES OF CITY LAND IN DOWNTOWN WERE WE TO SHIFT THOSE USES FROM PARKING TO HOUSING, IS NOT UNEXPECTED. YOU KNOW, I DON'T IMAGINE THAT EVERYONE IN THE COMMUNITY WILL BE HAPPY WITH THIS DIRECTION. I DON'T IMAGINE THAT A WHOLESALE SHIFT IN THIS DIRECTION WOULD NOT HAVE SOME NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON SOME R PRESENT USERS OF THESE SITES. ANY CHANGE THAT -- MOST ALL CHANGES HAVE THAT KIND OF PLUSES AND MINUSES THAT EBB AND FLOW. AND THAT'S LIFE AND REGRETTABLE. FOR MY PART, I'M CONFIDENT IN THE HEALTH AND THE VITALITY OF THE DOWNTOWN AS AN ECONOMIC ENGINE, AS AN ENGINE OF COMMERCE AND BUSINESS AND I -- AND I WANT MORE TO EMPHASIZE ITS AVAILABILITY FOR HOUSING BECAUSE I THINK THAT MEETS SO MANY OF OUR GOALS AND I THINK THIS IS IN PART A MAJOR WAY THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS WHETHER IT'S WITH RESPECT TO CLIMATE ACTION AND THE PREVENTION OF -- THE THE DEMOGRAPHIC SEGREGATION. AND I'M GLAD THAT WE ARE MOVING FORWARD. THANKS. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
01:24:23.478: >> Councilmember Hayner:  JUST SORT OF A QUICK QUESTION, COMMENT. SO A WHILE BACK, WE SET GOALS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND WITH SO MANY UNITS BY X YEAR. I WASN'T AROUND THEN. I'M NOT SURE WHAT THAT GOAL WAS. I KNOW WE HAVEN'T MET THE GOAL.
01:24:39.394: >> YEP.
01:24:39.661: >> Councilmember Hayner:  AND SO ARE WE BETTER OFF TO LOOK AT -- SO YOU SAID THIS POTENTIAL BY THIS DEVELOPMENT, SO MANY YEARS DOWN THE ROAD, WE MADE 1400 TO 1600 UNITS UNITS OF AFFE HOUSING THIS THAT RANGE OF AFFORDABILITY THROUGH THE CITY DOING IT. ARE WE BETTER OFF LOOKING AT TOTAL NUMBER OF UNITS OR PERCENTAGE OF UNITS OUT OF OUR TOTAL MARKET THAT ARE AFFORDABLE?
01:25:03.451: >> I BELIEVE WHEN THE MARKET ANALYSIS OR THE ANALYSIS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING WAS DONE IN 2015, THEY LOOKED AT THE WHOLE TO COME UP WITH THE NUMBERS. SO --
01:25:18.333: >> Councilmember Hayner: WHATEVER THAT RATIO WAS.
01:25:20.034: >> I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT WAS A PERFECT RATIO BUT IT WAS PART OF WHAT THEY LOOKED AT. IT WAS 140 UNITS A YEAR FOR FOUR YEARS. SO 2800 UNITS.
01:25:31.646: >> Mayor Taylor: 2800.
01:25:32.146: >> Councilmember Hayner:  SO 140 FOR 20 YEARS.
01:25:34.782: >> OKAY. THAT'S WHAT I HAD IN MY HEAD. SO IT'S TWICE THAT. IF WE WANTED TO GET -- WE ASKED THE 616, WHICH HAD 250 MARKET UNITS AND 20 AFFORDABLE UNITS ROUGHLY. IT'S 261 AND 19 WERE AFFORDABLE, I THINK IT WAS.
01:25:53.468: >> WE COUNT THOSE.
01:25:54.769: >> Councilmember Hayner: YEAH, RIGHT. SO THOSE ARE COUNTED.
01:25:57.805: >> RIGHT.
01:25:58.573: >> Councilmember Hayner:  BUT AT A RATIO OF 25:2. IF WE ARE GOING TO GET TO 2800, THEN WE WILL BE BUILDING -- THROUGH USE AND PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT, WE WILL BE PUTTING IN 36,000 UNITS OF MARKET RATE TO GET THAT RATIO. THAT'S NOT SUSTAINABLE OR BELIEVABLE THAT THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. ARE WE REALLY GOING TO BUILD THAT MUCH, WHERE WE WILL ADD 36,000 UNITS IN TEN YEARS? IS ANYBODY PROJECTING THAT? NO? IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IT.
01:26:28.936: >> I DON'T THINK SO.
01:26:29.804: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I'M GLAD WE ARE DOING IT THIS WAY. CLEARLY THE PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT RATIOS DO NOT WORK IN OUR FAVOR.
01:26:40.448: >> IT'S A SUPPLEMENT TO WHAT WE COULD DO.
01:26:42.583: >> Councilmember Hayner: YEAH, OKAY.
01:26:46.688: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
01:26:48.056: >> Councilmember Bannister:  I HAD TWO PROPERTIES I WANTED TO ASK ON. I JUST WANTED TO CONFIRM ON THE 415 WEST WASHINGTON, THAT THAT ONE IS A LOW PRIORITY AND BEING SORT OF TABLED FOR THE LONG TERM ON YOUR CHART.
01:27:10.378: >> I DON'T THINK IT WAS TABLED. IT WASN'T THE HIGHEST PRIORITY. IT HAD A LOT OF COMPETE THINGS HAPPENING ON IT.
01:27:15.249: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES. MOVING FORWARD WITH THE PRE-ENTITLEMENT PROCESS. I DON'T THINK I MENTIONED THIS EARLIER, BUT ONE THING WE TALKED ABOUT WITH THE SMITH GROUP WAS THEY GOT THE FREEDBACK FROM THE LARGER -- THE FEEDBACK FROM THE LARGER PROCESS. WE DIDN'T LAND THROUGH THAT PROCESS ON, YES, EVERYBODY LIKED THIS EXACT MODEL. IT WAS A HYBRID TYPE OF THING THAT THEY THINK WOULD BE WHAT THE COMMUNITY LET US KNOW ABOUT. AND SO WHAT WE TALKED TO THEM ABOUT WAS PUTTING THAT INFORMATION INTO ANOTHER DESIGN AND BRINGING IT BACK OUT TO THE COMMUNITY AGAIN AND HAVING MORE DISCUSSION ON IT. AND THEN START THAT PREENTITLEMENT PROCESS. SO STILL MOVING FORWARD. YOU KNOW, EVERYTHING IS ON ITS OWN TIME LINE. THAT MIGHT NOT BE THE ONE THAT -- IT MIGHT GET STALLED ALONG THE WAY BECAUSE WE ARE WORKING ON ANOTHER PROJECT BUT STILL MOVING IT FORWARD.
01:28:08.569: >> Councilmember Bannister: OKAY. WELL, I WANTED TO UNDERLINE SOME OF THE EMAILS AND CONVERSATIONS THAT WE HAD ABOUT BEING SURE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PLANS FOR THE TREELINE ARE FULLY DEVELOPED AND DISCLOSED TO RESIDENTS AS WE DISCUSS OTHER PLANS FOR THAT PROPERTY.
01:28:26.487: >> AND THE TREELINE MAYBE IT WASN'T PROMINENT IN THE DESIGN, BUT IT WAS INCLUDED IN ALL THE DESIGNS THAT WERE DISCUSSED WITH THE PUBLIC. THEY ALL HAD THE TREELINE TRAIL GOING THROUGH IT.
01:28:43.704: >> Councilmember Bannister: GOOD! WELL, THAT'S WHAT OTHER FOLKS WANTED TO BE SURE THAT THEY SAW THAT PROMINENTLY. AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE RECOMMENDING REALLY THE CITY CONTINUE TO OWN IT, NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS BECAUSE THEY HAVE A VERY VESTED INTEREST IN WHAT HAPPENS ON THAT, YOU KNOW, SPACE THAT ONCE -- THE GREENWAY THAT WILL RUN THROUGH THE PROPERTY. AND SO IT REALLY HAS TO MAKE SENSE. THE DESIGN HAS TO MAKE SENSE WITH THAT, ABSOLUTELY.
01:29:10.565: >> Councilmember Bannister: OKAY. GOOD. THANKS TFOR CONFIRMING THAT. I HAD SOME OTHER QUESTIONS ON THE 121 NORTH CATHERINE ONE. IF THE COUNTY PROPERTY ON THE SOUTH SIDE NEXT TO THE CITY PROPERTY ON NORTH SIDE, IF IT WOULD -- IT WOULD BE NICE IF THIS WOULD BE DEVELOPMENT ON EACH OF THOSE CORNERS, IF THE TWO PROJECTS COULD BE COORDINATED SO THAT THAT WOULD BE LESS DESTRUCTIVE IMPACT POTENTIALLY ON LOCAL BUSINESS AND ON THE WHOLE PARKING SITUATION.
01:29:44.065: >> I SUSPECT THAT THE TIMELINE ON WHICH THE CITY OWNED PROCESS IS ON WILL BE VERY DIFFERENT FROM AND THEY ARE NOT AS FAR ALONG AS WE ARE IN OUR DISCUSSION AND PROCESS. AND COORDINATED MEANS NOT AT THE SAME TIME, IT'S NOT AT THE SAME TIME. BUT IF COORDINATED MEANS AT THE SAME TIME, THAT WOULD BE MORE DIFFICULT. IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE ARE NOT HAVING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT IT. WE ARE. IT'S JUST IMAGINE THIS PROCESS THAT WE HAVE BEEN GOING THROUGH AND THEN COORDINATING THAT WITH ANOTHER ENTIRE POLITICAL BODY AND WHAT THEIR NEEDS ARE. IT WILL BE CHALLENGING, BUT WE ARE STILL TALKING TO THEM.
01:30:29.977: >> Councilmember Bannister: OKAY. WELL, I WAS JUST BRINGING IT UP BECAUSE SOME OF THE RESIDENTS HAD MENTIONED THAT SOME LOCAL BUSINESSES' PROFITS WERE DOWN AS MUCH AS A THIRD DURING FIFTH AVENUE IMPROVEMENTS. AND SO IF WE HAD TWO BACK-TO-BACK PROJECTS THAT COULD BE VERY DAMAGING LOCAL BUSINESS, WHICH IS SOMETHING THE KERRYTOWN DISTRICT ASSOCIATION AND OTHERS HAVE COME OUT STRONG, IS THAT THEY WANT TO BE THOROUGHLY ENGAGED IN THIS PLANNING. AND THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT -- I KNOW YOU HAVE SAID BEFORE, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN UNDERGROUND PARKING AND SURFACE LEVEL PARKING WAS ANOTHER QUESTION, AND I KNOW IT'S MUCH MORE -- MOST PEOPLE HAVE REALIZED IT'S MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE TO HAVE UNDERGROUND PARKING BUT THAT ALSO SEEMS TO BE SOMEWHAT OF A WAVE OF THE FUTURE IN COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY ARE RUNNING OUT OF LAND. IS THERE ANY -- IS UNDERGROUND PARKING STILL ON THE TABLE AT ALL?
01:31:29.670: >> WE ARE DEFINITELY LOOKING AT THAT WITH DOING A PARKING ANALYSIS AND COMING UP WITH A VARIETY R OF SOLUTIONS TO SEE WT EACH WOULD ENTATE AND COST, AND YOU CAN SEE IT IN LOOKING AT PRIORITIES. IF THE COMMUNITY WANTS TO SPEND X TO MAKE Y HAPPEN, THAT WILL ALL BE AVAILABLE FOR COUNCIL BEFORE WE MOVE FORWARD.
01:31:50.591: >> Councilmember Bannister: OKAY. AND THEN JUST MY LAST QUESTION WAS, JUST SORT OF A LOGISTICS, IF FEDERAL FUNDING, THE LIHTC IS REQUESTED FOR THE Y LOT AND THE CATHERINE LOT, DO THEY AT ALL CANCEL EACH OTHER OUT OR DO THEY APPLY SEPARATELY?
01:32:13.581: >> THEY APPLY AS THEIR OWN PROJECT. THERE'S A CAP BY DEVELOPER BUT THERE'S NOT A CAP BY COMMUNITY ON HOW MANY PROJECTS YOU CAN HAVE GOING AT THE SAME TIME. WHEN WE DID OUR FIRST RAD PUBLIC HOUSING CONVERSION, WE HAD TWO TAX CREDIT PROJECTS THAT GOT AWARDED IN THE SAME ROUND. SO THAT'S NOT GOING TO CAUSE A PROBLEM. WE WOULD NOT PUT FIVE PROJECTS IN THE SAME ROUND. WE MIGHT PUT TWO. LIKE, THAT WOULD -- DEFINITELY YOU WOULDN'T GET FIVE PROJECTS FUNDED BECAUSE THEY DON'T FUND THAT MANY AT THE SAME ROUND.
01:32:44.412: >> Councilmember Bannister: THANK YOU.
01:32:45.279: >> AND THERE'S TWO ROUNDS PER YEAR.
01:32:49.383: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
01:32:50.284: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR AND THANK YOU, MS. HALL. THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE STEP FORWARD. EARLY LAST YEAR, WE TOOK OUR FIRST STEP IN THIS PROJECT, WITH A SERIES RESOLUTIONS DIRECTING THE STUDY OF THESE SITES AND THEN BACK IN NOVEMBER, WE TOOK A FOLLOW-UP ACTION. AND NOW IN MARCH, WE ARE SET UP TO TAKE NOW A THIRD AND IT'S INCREDIBLE THAT WE NOW GET TO TAKE THREE STEPS SPREAD OUT OVER THE COURSE OF EVERY FOUR TO SIX MONTHS AND NOW YOU HAVE PLANNED FOR US WHAT WE WILL BE VOTING ON EVERY SIX MONTHS UNTIL 2027.
01:33:23.784: >> THAT'S RIGHT.
01:33:24.185: >> Councilmember Ackerman: AND THAT'S THE WAY IT SHOULD BE. THIS IS TERRIFIC LONG-TERM PLANNING OF HOW WE INTEND TO MAKE A BIG DENT IN ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CRISIS OUR COMMUNITY IS FACING AND THAT'S OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS AND TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO WALK DOWN THIS PATH IS REALLY APPRECIATED AND IT ALL HAS TO DO WITH YOU AND YOUR TEAM.
01:33:48.609: >> AND THE CITY COUNCIL AND THE MAYOR.
01:33:51.011: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  WE PUT OURSELVES ON THE BACK ENOUGH. WE WILL PAT YOU ON THE BACK. I LOOKED AT THE NUMBER FROM THE NOVEMBER REPORT, IT LOOKS LIKE UNDER SCENARIO TWO, WHICH IS -- EXCUSE ME, SCENARIO ONE WHICH WAS MIXED INCOME HOUSING, MAXIMIZING AS MANY UNITS AS POSSIBLE, AND THIS IS WITHOUT 353 SOUTH MAIN, WHICH YOU SAID TO BE 50 OR 60 UNITS. THAT WAS 927, 450 OF WHICH WOULD BE AFFORDABLE AND THEN 475ISH WOULD BE MARKET RATE.
01:34:22.109: >> AND I THINK IT ALSO DIDN'T INCLUDE WEST WASHINGTON OR THE Y SITE EITHER, DID IT? YOU WOULD HAVE TO ADD THOSE 400 OR 500 UNITS IN.
01:34:32.219: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YEAH, YOU ARE RIGHT. SO THAT 1600 NUMBER MAKES A LOT OF SENSE. AND THAT RATIO IS 50/50, YOU THINK?
01:34:39.627: >> OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD.
01:34:42.263: >> Counc
01:34:43.397: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THE TOP OF YOUR HEAD IS BETTER THAN THE TOP OF MY HEAD. AWESOME. SUPER, SUPER APPRECIATED. AND, YEAH, I THINK WE HAVE GOTTEN HERE -- AND ALMOST EVERY SINGLE VOTE HAS BEEN UNANIMOUS AT COUNCIL, AND I HOPE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE THAT MOMENTUM BECAUSE THE VOTES ARE GOING TO GET MORE CHALLENGING AS THE TRADEOFFS BECOME MORE CLEAR. HOUSING VERSUS PARKING, LOCAL SUBSIDY VERSUS STATE SUBSIDY, AND THOSE TRADEOFFS WILL ONLY GET TOUGHER AND I HOPE WE CAN KEEP THESE VOTES AS CLOSE TO UNANIMOUS AS POSSIBLE MOVING FORWARD.
01:35:19.233: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
01:35:20.134: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. MR. MAYOR THANK YOU. MS. HALL, YOU KNOW, I HAVE THE PLEASURE OF GETTING TO WORK WITH YOU AND GETTING TO READ FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS AS THELY AON THN TO THE HOUSING COMMISSION AND I'M SO GLAD THAT MY COLLEAGUES GOT TO SEE WHAT I GET TO SEE FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS. I WANTED TO END ON A FEW POSITIVE COMMENTS AND NOT TO CUT OFF MY COLLEAGUES IF THEY HAD SOMETHING TO SAY. I KNOW WE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THE VALUE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AT THIS TABLE AND I LIKE THAT WE HAVE A MODEL THAT WE CAN BRING FORWARD FOR ENGAGEMENT ON OTHER PROPERTIES. AND SOME THINGS THAT I SAW THAT I REALLY LIKED FROM THE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT PROCESS THAT CAME FORWARD WAS I THINK WE HEARD RESOUNDING SUPPORT FROM THE COMMUNITY FOR THE VALUE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND EVEN IF THAT MEANS HAVING MORE DENSITY ON THOSE SITES, THAT THAT WAS A VALUE THAT WE HEARD FROM THE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT SESSIONS, AS WELL AS THE SURVEYS, BUT THAT WE WERE ALSO SEEING OTHER GOALS, LIKE THE TREELINE ON THE 415 PROPERTY. SO THAT, I THINK IS TERRIFIC. I THINK WE HAVE SEEN A LOT OF SUPPORT FROM OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS, AS EVIDENCED BY EVEN, YOU KNOW, W WHO IS HERE IN THE AUDIENCE BUT REALLY DO APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT FROM THE DDA AND THE WILLINGNESS TO BE FLEXIBLE, AND RESPONSIVE AND HOW CAN WE BEST UTILIZE THE RESOURCES THAT HAVE BEEN COMMITTED AND WILLINGNESS TO LOOK FORWARD AND PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. I THINK THAT'S TERRIFIC AND I JUST WANTED TO NOTE THAT BECAUSE I THINK IT'S REALLY APPRECIATED. AND THEN ALSO, ON THAT SLIDE THAT WE JUST HAD UP RECENTLY, THAT IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME, OKAY, SO THERE'S CONCERNS ABOUT PARKING, THAT'S EXPECTED THERE, AND YOU SIT IN THE SEAT LONG ENOUGH, YOU HEAR LOTS ABOUT PARKING, BUT, YOU KNOW, I THINK WE HAVE SEEN SOME INNOVATIVE RESPONSES THAT WE WOULD EXPECT FROM THIS COMMUNITY WHO KNEW THAT THEIR COMMUNITIES WITH TROLLEYS WHO RUN 24 HOURS ON A TRACK. IF EVEN IF WE DON'T HAVE THERE, A DROP OFF AND PICK UP STATION SO YOU CAN DROP OFF WHAT YOU HAVE AT THE FARMER'S MARKET AND COME COME PICK IT UP. THAT SEEMS PRETTY FEASIBLE GIVEN THE STAFF THAT WE HAVE IN THE CITY AND I THINK IF YOU SAID TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO PICK UP YOUR ITEMS FROM THE FARMER'S MARKET FROM THE PICKUP STATION IF IT MEANT GETTING 80 UNITS AF UNITSF AFFORDABLE HOUSING, I BET THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY WHO WOULD SAY YES. I THINK THERE'S ALL SORTS OF WAYS THAT WE CAN PURCHASE GOODS AND SERVICES AND HAVE THEM DELIVERED TO US, WE ARE PRETTY USED TO PICKING UP THINGS IF BOXES. SO THAT'S -- SO I JUST WANTED TO, YOU KNOW, AGAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR TREMENDOUS WORK. IT'S CLEAR AND IT'S COMPREHENSIVE AND IT REALLY DOES GIVE US A PATH FORWARD WHICH WE WANTED FOR SUCH A LONG TIME. THANK YOU.
01:38:33.093: >> Mayor Taylor: ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU. WE NOW COME TO PUBLIC COMMENT GENERAL TIME. PUBLIC COMMENT GENERAL TIME IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO SPEAK TO COUNCIL AND THE COMMUNITY ABOUT MATTERS OF MUNICIPAL INTEREST. TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT INTEREST TIME, ONE NEED NOT HAVE SIGNED UP IN ADVANCE. SPEAKERS HAVE THREE MINUTES IN WHICH TO SPEAK. PLEASE PLAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE TIME CLOCK. AS A MATTER OF COURTESY, WE MAY ONLY HAVE ONE PERSON SPEAKING AT A TIME. AND IF YOU REQUIRE ASSISTANCE IN SPEAKING BEFORE COUNCIL TODAY, WE WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO PROVIDE IT FOR YOU. IS THERE ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT?
01:39:07.428: >> HELLO, I'M JEFF CROCKETT, 506 EAST KINGSLEY AND I WANT TO START OFF BY THANKING JENNIFER, BECAUSE I SENT A NUMBER -- A NUMBER OF US SENT EMAILS WITH THE LIST OF CONCERNS. AND SHE RESPONDED VERY QUICKLY WITH A VERY, VERY GOOD RESPONSE, AND SO WE REALLY APPRECIATE THAT. AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUED COMMUNICATION. ONE OF THE -- AND I WOULD MAKE SOME SUGGESTIONS ABOUT THE POWERPOINT AND THAT IS ONE OF THE UNFORTUNATE THINGS, I THINK THE SLIDE WHERE IT TALKS ABOUT THE THREE DIFFERENT KINDS OF DEVELOPMENT, ONE IS MOVING FORWARD WITH ENGAGEMENT, AND THIS WAS A SLIDE JUST WITH -- YOU KNOW, STARTING FORWARD. WELL, I DON'T KNOW, TO ME, THE FACT THAT IT SAID "WITH ENGAGEMENT" AT ONE AND NOTHING ON THE OTHER SORT OF SUGGESTED TO ME NO ENGAGEMENT AND THAT RAISED A WARNING FLAG, WHICH CAUSED US TO REALLY THINK CAREFULLY. IF THERE'S ANOTHER WAY OF LOOKING AT THAT, WE WOULD APPRECIATE IT. AND THE OTHER -- AND YOU WILL SORT OF LAUGH AT THIS ONE, FOR THE CONCRETE THINKERS LIKE ME, WHEN I WAS LOOKING AT THE DATES, YOU WAS THINKING OF EUROPEAN, LIKE 20th OF JULY, I WASN'T THINKING YEAR 2020. SO FOR CONCRETE THINKERS, IF YOU COULD SWITCH THAT AROUND AND SAY JULY 2020, YOU KNOW, OR -- JUST TO SWITCH THAT AROUND FOR LEFT/RIGHT THINKERS, WE WOULD APPRECIATE THAT. I WANT TO THANK COUNCILMEMBER LUMM AND BANNISTER FOR THEIR THOUGHTFUL ANALYSIS OF THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE. I WAS REALLY APPRECIATE I APPRECIATIVE OFTHAT AND THE ENGE KERRYTOWN COUNCIL. AND I KNOW BOTH OF YOU ARE INVOLVED AND I'M SURE JEFF WILL BE. I WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW THAT CHRIS, THE PRESIDENT OF THE OLD FOURTH WARD ASSOCIATION IS GOING TO BE MEETING REGULARLY WITH THE KERRYTOWN ASSOCIATION AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS PROCESS. I JUST WANT TO ALSO MENTION THAT WHEN WE STARTED TO ENGAGE WITH THE KERRYTOWN DISTRICT COUNCIL, THAT TWO-THIRDS OF THE PEOPLE WHO VISIT KERRYTOWN COME FROM OUT OF TOWN. WHEN WE DO -- AND I'M REALLY THRILLED THAT SUSAN POLLOCK WILL BE INVOLVED WITH THE PARKING ANALYSIS. I HAVE TO MENTION HER NAME AT LEAST ONCE. BUT I ALSO BASICALLY WANT TO SAY WHEN WE DO THE PARKING ANALYSIS, IT SHOULD BE DURING PEAK SEASON, AS WELL AS OFF-SEASON. SO WE GET A BETTER SENSE OF HOW THAT'S GOING TO WORK AND ALSO IF THERE'S SOME WAY OF SURVEYING PEOPLE FROM OUT-OF-TOWN WHO WILL BE COMING IN. YOU CAN DO THAT WITH A SIMPLE SURVEY AT SOME OF THESE LOCAL BUSINESSES. WHAT DO YOU THINK IF PARKING WAS ELIMINATED AT THAT SITE TO GET THE IMPRESSION FROM MANY OF OUR CUSTOMERS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
01:42:10.177: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT?
01:42:19.052: >> GOOD EVENING, MY NAME IS DAVID SILKWORTH AND I'M A RESIDENT OF THE 4th WARD. I WANTED TO MAKE A FEW COMMENTS ABOUT TONIGHT'S PRESENTATION. FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU FOR THE GREAT PRESENTATION. I THINK IT LAID OUT A LOT OF GOOD CONVERSATION POINTS THAT WE NEED TO HAVE AS AI COMMUNITY. SECONDLY -- A COMMUNITY. SECONDLY, I WANT TO SAY THAT I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS THAT THE LOSS OF THE SURFACE PARKING LOTS UP IN KERRYTOWN WILL HAVE WITH THE DEVELOPMENTS UP THERE AND SOME AREAS IN OUR DOWNTOWN. WE NEED TO SUPPORT OUR LOCAL BUSINESSES. YOU CAN'T THROW THE BABY OUT WITH THE BATH WATER, YOU KNOW? WE NEED TO FOCUS ON OUR LOCAL PEOPLE. AND I ALSO WANT TO SAY THAT I THINK THAT THE GROUP THAT YOU ARE TARGETING, THE INCOME GROUP, IS ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE. I THINK WE NEED TO FIND THAT MISSING MIDDLE HOUSING IN OUR COMMUNITY AND DO THAT IN A REALLY CREATIVE WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE MAXIMIZE THE RETURN ON ANY INVESTMENTS THAT WE MAKE. THE OTHER THING I WOULD LIKE TO SAY IS A LOT OF PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, THERE'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN REALLY LOW INCOME HOUSING AND THIS LOW-INCOME HOUSING SET THAT WE ARE TRYING TO TARGET HERE. THESE FOLKS ARE GOING TO HAVE JOBS. THIS HE WILL HAVE THEIR LITTLE FAMILIES AND HAVE THEIR -- YOU KNOW, THEY WILL BUY THEIR LITTLE CARS AND HOPEFULLY THEY WILL BE ELECTRIC. AND THEY WILL WANT TO TAKE A TRIP OUT TO THE BEACH OR GO CAMPING AND SO THEY WILL NEED A PARKING SPACE AND WHETHER YOU PROVIDE THAT DOWNTOWN, AND THEY WILL PROBABLY PREFER SOME PLACE CLOSE TO WHERE THEY LIVE OR A PARK AND RIDE LOT, THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WILL HAVE TO CONSIDER, OKAY? AND I KNOW THAT BECAUSE, LOOK, I LIVE IN A BUILDING TAG IS FULL OF PEOPLE WHO MAKE THIS INCOME LEVEL AND YOU KNOW WHAT, THEY ALL HAVE CARS AND TAKE THEIR LITTLE TRIPS AND HAVE THEIR LITTLE FAMILIES AND DO THEIR LITTLE THINGS. ANYWAY. HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.
01:44:13.600: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
01:44:24.311: >> GOOD EVENING, I'M STEVEN RANSINI AND I'M THE PRESIDENT AND THE C.E.O. OF THE UNIVERSITY BANK WHICH IS THE LARGEST LOCALLY BASED MORTGAGE-BASED LENDER IN WASHTENAW COUNTY AND I'M VICE PRESIDENT AND PREVIOUSLY PRESIDENT OF THE ANN ARBOR EDC AND WE HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING. I WILL JUST HASTEN TO MENTION THAT WHILE I'M A MEMBER OF THE NARDC, ALL THIS WORK IS PURELY JUST ME PROVIDING MY EXPERTISE AT NO COST TO THE CITY AND OUR CITIZENS. SOME THINGS THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL IN THE MIX OF FINANCING AFFORDABLE HOUSING OR WORKFORCE HOUSING, I WOULD JUST MENTION VERY BRIEFLY AND IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, FEEL FREE TO REACH OUT TO ME. I KNOW ALL OF YOU. YOU KNOW ME. FEEL FREE. THERE IS $10,000 PER UNIT OF GRANTS AVAILABLE FROM THE FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK OF INDIANAPOLIS TO ANY MEMBER, BANK, OR CREDIT UNION. WE HAVE -- WE ARE BLESSED WITH 21 BANKS AND CREDIT UNIONS IN OUR TOWN. SO THE LOVE CAN GO AROUND. THERE IS AN INNOVATIVE CONCEPT CALLED AN L3C, WHICH IS AN LLC WITH ANOTHER L. IT'S A MICHIGAN-TYPE OF CORPORATION, WHICH ALLOWS A FOUNDATION, WHICH IS I.R.S. APPROVED TO MAKE AN INVESTMENT WHICH ACCOUNTS TO THE ANNUAL REQUIREMENT TO GIVE 4% OF THEIR ENDOWMENT TO KEEP THEIR TAX ADVANTAGE, THE TAX-FREE ADVANTAGE WITHOUT ALIENATING THE MONEY FROM THE ENDOWMENT AND THIS IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING YOU WOULD WANT TO TAP INTO TO GET LARGE FOUNDATIONS LIKE CRESS CRE FOUNDATION OR OTHERS INVOLVED. WE HAD A MEETING AT 4:00, DISCUSSING INNOVATIVE IDEAS AROUND REVENUE BONDS. THAT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING WORTH EXPLORING FURTHER. I WOULD MENTION ALSO, YOU KNOW WHERE IS THERE A NEED FOR GAP FINANCING BETWEEN, SAY, REVENUE BONDS AND THE NEEDS OF INVESTORS FOR CREDIT RISK CONTROL PURPOSES, IT WOULD BE ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE, I BELIEVE, FOR PENSION FUNDS TO CO-INVEST WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR. FOR EXAMPLE, JUST TO USE PROMINENT ORGANIZATION -- IF McKINLEY THOUGHT A PROJECT WAS FINANCIALLY FEASIBLE, I THINK IT WOULD BE A GOOD THING FOR THE PENSION FUND TO CO-INVEST ON THE SAME TERMS AND CONDITIONS THAT THAT WOULD BE A GOOD INVESTMENT. THE CITY CONTROLS HALF A BILLION DOLLARS OF PENSION FUND MONEY. THE COUNTY A SIMILAR AMOUNT, AND THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN ALSO CONTROLS A VERY LARGE ENDOWMENT WITH A VERY LARGE REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT FUND TODAY. THEY WOULD NOT ONLY GET DOUBLE BOTTOM LINE BUT TRIPLE BOTTOM LINE. CROWD FUNDING IS ANOTHER VERY INTERESTING OPPORTUNITY FOR GETTING PEOPLE INVOLVED. THERE'S AN EXECUTIVE WE RECENTLY HIRED THAT WAS RAISING $1 MILLION A WEEK FOR A REAL ESTATE MORTGAGE FUND THROUGH CROWD FUNDING. I BELIEVE A MILLAGE IS A VERY BAD IDEA. I THINK TO CUSTOMERS THAT I KNOW PERSONALLY, WHO I HAVE HELPED OVER THE YEARS INCLUDING ONE WOULD LITERALLY LIVES ON CAT FOOD A FEW DAYS AT THE END OF EVERY MONTH BECAUSE IN ORDER TO KEEP HER HOME, THAT'S WHAT SHE NEEDS TO DO.
01:47:37.237: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WOULD WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT?
01:47:57.390: >> HELLO, I'M MARY KENT BRUCEY AND I LIVE IN ANN ARBOR ON HALL AVENUE. AND I OWN FOUNT GALLERY OVER IN KERRYTOWN MARKET AND SHOPS AND I KNOW EACH OF YOU RECEIVED A LETTER FROM ME KIND OF OUTLINING WHAT SOME OF MY CONCERNS WERE. I WAS OUT OF TOWN THIS WEEK AND DID NOT ATTEND THE KERRYTOWN MEETING, BUT I WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE WITH EACH OF YOU ABOUT WHAT IT TAKES TO BE A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER IN KERRYTOWN IN THESE TIMES. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I FOUND REALLY INTERESTING WAS THE STUDY THAT DAVE PONTHUNE DID SHOWING THAT -- CONFIRMING SOMETHING THAT I HAVE OFTEN SAID. I HAVE OFTEN SAID THAT I HAD THE SENSE THAT ABOUT 60% OF MY CUSTOMERS -- AND I HAVE BEEN A BUSINESS OWNER IN KERRYTOWN FOR THE LAST ALMOST 15 YEARS. I ALWAYS HAD THE SENSE ABOUT 60% OF MY CUSTOMERS CAME FROM A WIDER THAN 60-MILE RADIUS. I HAD THAT SENSE BECAUSE WE ARE A SHOP THAT MAKES A POINT OF TALKING TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND KNOWING WHERE THEY COME FROM. WE WELCOME PEOPLE WHO COME TO THE UNIVERSITY HOSPITALS FOR TREATMENT. WE WELCOME PEOPLEHO TRAVEL FROM BOTH COASTS ON REGULAR BASIS FOR BUSINESS. WE HAVE A WONDERFUL SET OF REGULAR REPEAT LOCAL CUSTOMERS, BUT THE STUDY THAT DAVE PUTHUTDE DID AND PRESENTED TO US AND WE WOULD LIKE TO SHARE, WITH THE MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION, IS THAT IN A STUDY THAT LOOKED AT A YEAR'S TIME AND HAD OVER 9,000 RANDOMLY SELECTED LOCATIONS OF WHERE THE CELL PHONE DATA FROM VARIOUS PEOPLE WHO VISITED KERRYTOWN MARKET AND SHOPS CAME FROM, IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT ONLY 29% OF THE CUSTOMERS LIVE IN ANN ARBOR. THAT THE PEOPLE WHO WERE IN THE GE UPHO FENCED AREA, THE KERRYTN MARKET AND SHOPS. IT SHOWED THAT 43% LIVED ELSEWHERE IN MICHIGAN AND THAT 22% LIVE ELSEWHERE IN THE COUNTRY. WHEN YOU ARE LOOKING AT BRINGING IN 60 UNITS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING, THAT IS WONDERFUL, BUT THIS NEEDS TO BE A WAY TO ACCOUNT FOR THE PEOPLE WHO COME
