00:02:40.077: >> I CAN TELL BY YOUR BACKGROUND.
00:02:43.380: >> YEP. LOVELY OLD ANN ARBOR.
00:02:44.414: >> SORRY ABOUT THAT.
00:02:46.683: >> OKAY. WE ARE REALLY ONTO THE ITEM THREE, NO INTRODUCTIONS. WE WILL QUICKLY MOVED UP TO ITEM FOUR, WHICH IS APPROVAL OF THE AGENDA. MAY I HAVE A MOTION TO APPROVE THE AGENDA?

ALL IN FAVOR OF THAT MOTION, PLEASE SAY AYE OR RAISE YOUR HAND. THAT IS ALL HANDS. BUT. MOTION CARRIES. WE ARE ON TO ITEM SIX, WHICH ARE ALL OF THE REPORTS. A COUNCILMEMBER DISH?
00:03:46.643: >> THE MOST INTERESTING THING THAT HAPPENED THAT CANCELED LAST WAS THAT THE STTR ORDINANCES WERE PASSED. AND APPRECIATION WAS EXPRESSED. WITH THE OF HAVING THESE IN THE ZONING CODE. AND THERE ARE A COUPLE OF US WHO ARE EXPLORING WHAT WE MIGHT THINK OF AS PHASE TWO, WHICH MIGHT INVOLVE SOME WORK ON WHAT IS PROVISION FOR MIXED USE ZONES. I DON'T WANT TO SAY ANYTHING AND GET AHEAD OF MYSELF BECAUSE WE REALLY ARE JUST STARTING IN HAVE NOT MET WITH STAFF. THE 614 SOUTH ASHLEY FRANKLIN WAS APPROVED. THE 22260 AND 3411 GEDDES ANNEXATIONS WERE APPROVED. AND THERE'S NOTHING THAT I CAN THINK OF OTHER CONSENT AGENDA OTHER THAN THAT THE ALLOCATION FOR HEALTHY STREETS DID NOT PASS. THAT IS MORE DIRECTLY OF CONCERN TO OUR TRANSPORTATION BUDDIES. I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT WANT TO K KNOW.
00:04:48.205: >> THEY TALKED ABOUT IT AT OUR JOINT MEETING TOGETHER, SO THANK YOU FOR SHARING THAT WITH US. MR. LEONARD, DO YOU HAVE ANY REPORT? EXPECT I DO. THREE ITEMS. FIRST OFF, AND REMINDER THAT NEXT BIG'S NORMALLY IS SCHEDULED WORKING SESSION. INSTEAD, WE WILL BE JOINING THE ENERGY COMMISSION FOR A PRESENTATION BY THE ROCKY MOUNTAIN INSTITUTE ON ELECTRIFICATION OF DEVELOPMENT. THAT MEETING WILL START AT 6:00 P.M. AND WE WILL BE JOINING THE ENERGY COMMISSION BECAUSE THAT IS A REGULAR AGENDA. COMMISSION BILLS THAT YOU WILL BE THAT SECONDARY SHARE. SO LOOK FOR THAT AGENDA COMING OUT LATE NEXT WEEK. REMINDER OF MAY 18th IS THAT RESCHEDULE OF THE OCCUPATIONAL ORDINANCE CONSIDERATIONS. THAT WOULD BE ON THE AGENDA. AND THEN A BIT OF A MARICOPA THAT I WANT TO MAKE. THE PROPOSED TC ONE ZONING DISTRICT IS PROGRESSING WITH CITY COUNCIL. I WANTED TO SHARE WITH YOU HOW EVER THAT I WILL BE ADDING SORT OF A MEMO, A STAFF RECOMMENDATION TO THE CITY COUNCIL RECOMMENDING THAT THEY BE CONSIDERED THE CHANGE THAT WAS MADE TO INCREASE THE HEIGHT UP TO 300 FEET AND I THINK EXCEEDS THOUSAND FEET OF RESIDENTIALLY ZONED PROPERTIES. I WAS PART OF THAT DISCUSSION AND AT THE TIME, I COMMUNICATED TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION THAT THAT WOULD CREATE SOME OPPORTUNITY FOR THE TALLER BUILDINGS,ARTILAR IN THE STATE ANEISEOWER AA. AT ITHE SE. I DON'T THINK UPON REFLECTION THAT THE GEOGRAPHY THAT THAT CREATES IS NECESSARILY A LOGICAL GEOGRAPHY FOR THAT TO OCCUR IN THAT WAY. SO I THINK THAT THAT WARRANTS ADDITIONAL CONVERSATION. IT IS PROGRESSING AS RECOMMENDED. BUT I JUST WANTED TO ALERT YOU TOUCH OF THE CONDITION THAT -- AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO EXPLORE THAT INTERACTIVE MAP IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT AS WELL. IT CREATES, I THINK, -- I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S GREAT AN APPROPRIATE PATTERN FOR WHERE I THINK THAT, AS THE PLANNING COMMISSION AND I ENVISION THAT IT WOULD CREATE THAT DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITY. I THINK THAT A HIGHER HEIGHT LIMIT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED PROBABLY AND RECONFIGURED. NONETHELESS, THAT DISTRICT HAS TO BE PROGRESSED TO CITY COUNCIL. THEY HAVE ASKED FOR THAT BY JUN. WE WILL BE PRESENTING IT AT THE FIRST JUNE MEETING. BUT AGAIN, I WANTED TO OTHER YOU TO THAT STAFF NOTE THAT I'M GOING TO BE PRESENTING TO THE COUNSEL. AND I ANTICIPATE THAT THAT WOULD PROBABLY REFLECT SOME ADDITIONAL CONVERSATIONS. THAT IS ALL.
00:07:47.384: >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ARE THERE ANY COMMISSIONER OF RESOURCE OR COMMITTEE LIAISONS THAT HAVE ANYTHING TO REPORT? I CAN REPORT THAT THE ORC DID MEET LAST WEEK. WE DISCUSSED THE WHOLE OCCUPATIONAL ORDINANCE. THERE WAS -- TO COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN'S SHOUT-OUTS OF THE STORY ABOUT IT. KIND OF -- WHICH I THINK DOES A GOOD JOB, AT LEAST WHAT I THOUGHT OUR DISCUSSION WAS COMING OUT OF THAT. I'M IMAGINING THAT THE DRAFT ORDINANCE THAT WILL BE DISCUSSING WILL BE -- IS THERE ANY -- WILL IT BE AVAILABLE BEFORE THAT WE CAN BEFORE, WHICH WAS KIND OF THE IDEA BEFORE -- OR DO YOU HAVE ANY -- LIKE, HOW --
00:08:40.704: >> I HATE TO SPEAK CLOSELY ON THAT ON THE WEBSITE. MAYBE NO LATER THAN WEDNESDAY OF NEXT WEEK. BUT POTENTIALLY EVEN BY THE END OF THIS WEEK. I WILL SEND THE NOTICE OUT TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION. WE CAN ALSO SHARE THAT WITH THAT NEIGHBORHOOD PLANNING E-MAIL LIST, THAT RESOURCE GET THAT DRAFT IS AVAILABLE ON THAT WEBSITE AS WELL.
00:09:00.590: >> THAT IS GREAT. THANKS. WE ALSO DISCUSSED SOME OF THE PROGRESS THAT STAFF HAD MADE ON THE SITE PLAN APPROVAL PROCESS FOR THOSE SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED PROJECTS. THEY HAVE KIND OF A NEW GRID LAID OUT AND KIND OF LANDS FOR THE NEXT STEP OF, YOU KNOW, WHAT IS REQUIRED. SO THEY ARE MAKING GOOD PROGRESS ON THAT. I'M EXCITED BUT YOU ALL GET TO SEE THAT. ALL RIGHT. ITEM SEVEN, THEN, IS PUBLIC COMMENT. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PERSONS TO SPEAK FOR UP TO THREE MINUTES ABOUT AN ISSUE THAT IS NOT LISTED AS A PUBLIC HEARING ON THIS AGENDA. THERE WILL BE THREE PUBLIC HEARINGS TONIGHT. 2601 PONTIAC TRAIL, WHICH IS THE LANDSCAPE MODIFICATION. 336 SOUTH ASHLEY, THAT DOES NEED MARIJUANA CONSUMPTION FACILITY AND 2280 AND 2290, WHICH IS THE GOLF COURSE ADDITION REZONING.

00:11:20.363: >> I SEE COMMISSIONER LEE HAS GUITAR IN THE BACKGROUND. MAYBE YOU COULD COMPOSE SOME JEOPARDY LIKE MUSIC FOR THESE SEGMENTS.
00:11:28.605: >> I LIKED THAT.
00:11:29.005: >> I THINK I WOULD BE BETTER OFF WITH THE PIANO. I GOT YOU.
00:11:34.210: >> I DON'T SEE ANY INDICATION.

00:11:47.857: >> NOTE NEW PUBLIC HEARINGS. IT IS HOME OCCUPATION.

00:13:18.915: >> OKAY. ALL RIGHT. LET'S SEE IF WE CAN DO THIS UNDER PRESSURE.
00:13:42.238: >> IT LOOKS LIKE NO.

00:13:50.380: >> ALL RIGHT. LET'S START OVER AGAIN. LET'S FIND IT. I HAD IT ALL LOADED HERE. OKAY. QUITE SIMPLY, WHAT WE ARE ASKING FOR THIS EVENING IS A LANDSCAPE MODIFICATION WEST. WE HAVE A CONFLICTING LAND-USE BUFFER OF THE PROPERTY LINE WHICH REQUIRES A TYPICAL --
00:14:25.615: >> I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT. IF YOU THINK YOU ARE SHARING THE SCREEN, I DON'T SEE ANYTHING.
00:14:29.819: >> OKAY.
00:14:34.357: >> SCOTT COOKE THIS IS DAMIEN. LET ME SEE IF I CAN DO THIS.
00:14:41.664: >> OKAY.
00:14:42.498: >> OH, WAIT. YOU HAVE GOT IT NOW.
00:14:44.133: >> YEP.

00:14:53.243: >> SO NOTE SLIDES YET. BUT --
00:14:58.248: >> SUCCESS?
00:15:02.518: >> NO.
00:15:03.286: >> OH. I'M SEEING IT. ALL RIGHT.
00:15:07.357: >> YOU MIGHT NEED TO STOP SCREEN SHARING AND WE START.
00:15:10.093: >> OKAY. WITH YOU. BUT I'M GOING TO -- START IF THIS FAILS, I WILL TRY TO GET OH DOES TAKE OVER. YOU GOT IT.
00:15:22.038: >> THERE YOU GO.
00:15:22.705: >> ALL RIGHT. BACK TO IT MY STORY. OKAY. WE HAVE A TYPICAL CONFLICTING LAND-USE BUFFER AGAINST OUR SELVES PROPERTY LINE. IT IS THAT NORMAL FASHION, REQUIRING 13 EVERY 15 FEET WITH A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF SHRUBBERY. THAT WAS PROPOSED ALL ALONG. NEVER CONSULTED. WHAT HAPPENED IS THAT DETROIT EDISON ACTUALLY HAS A POWER LINE THAT RUNS ALONG THE COMMON PROPERTY LINE BACK HERE. AND THAT IS WHERE THEY HAD TO DRAW THE POWER TO FEED MUCH OF THE SUBDIVISION FROM. AND AS SUCH, THEY SAID, WE NEED TO HANG SOME TRANSFORMERS BACK THERE AND SOME OTHER APPURTENANCES AND WE NEED TO GET THERE TO BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN THEM IN THE EVENT AT THAT THERE'S ANY ISSUE. THEY SAID, WE CAN'T HAVE YOUR TREES HERE BECAUSE IF YOUR TREES ARE HERE, WE CAN'T, LIKE, DRIVE OUR VEHICLES BACK HERE OR WHEN YOUR TREES GET BIG ENOUGH AND JUST ABOUT THE TIME EVERYONE? THE SIZE OF THEM, WE WILL COME DOWN AND CUT THE TOPS OFF OF THEM AND THAT IS GOING TO MAKE EVERYBODY UPSET. THEY SAID, IT CAN YOU GUYS PLEASE MOVE YOUR TREES OUT OF A 15-FOOT -- 12-FOOT OR 15-FOOT EASEMENT, A REAL NEED TO ACCESS TO THIS. WE REALLY WERE FACED WITH A CHOICE HERE. THEY WERE LIKE, YOU WANT POWER? THIS IS WHAT WE NEED. AND SO WE DID NOT REALLY HAVE A CHOICE. SO WE SAID, WELL, THERE'S NO HARM TO MOVE THEM FORWARD. AND LET ME SEE IF I CAN -- ARE YOU GUYS STILL THERE? DO YOU SEE WHAT I GOT?
00:17:17.186: >> WE ARE STILL THERE. I DON'T KNOW THAT THE SLIDE CHANGED.
00:17:25.061: >> NO?
00:17:25.294: >> I DON'T THINK IT DID.
00:17:27.029: >> YOU DON'T SEE A NEW EASEMENT THERE?
00:17:30.233: >> NOTE.
00:17:30.767: >> IT DID NOT SHOW UP, SCOTT.
00:17:37.507: >> HUH. WELL, IT SHOULD HAVE.
00:17:39.475: >> LET ME TRY HERE.
00:17:41.377: >> OKAY.
00:17:41.644: >> I WILL TRY TO TAKE OVER FOR AT YOU.
00:17:44.447: >> ALL RIGHT.
00:17:45.248: >> DOES EVERYBODY SEE A NICE PRETTY SCREEN WITH PURPLE --
00:17:48.284: >> WE DO.
00:17:49.385: >> WE GOT IT.
00:17:51.354: >> GREAT. ALL RIGHT.
00:17:52.688: >> SO BASICALLY, THE PURPLE IS WORK WITH THE TREES USED TO BE. SO WE BASICALLY WOULD JUST SHOOT THEM JUST A LITTLE BIT TENTATIVE NORTH, ABOUT 12 FEET. SINK AMOUNT OF TREES. SAME AMOUNT OF COVERAGE. WE JUST HAD HAD TO MOVE THEM OUT FROM UNDERNEATH. OUR EXISTING POWER LINES TO BE HONEST WITH YOU. SO THE DETROIT EDISON COULD GET IN THERE AND DO MAINTENANCE AND FUTURE SERVICE IF THEY NEEDED. THEY HAVE EASEMENT FROM OUR DRIVEWAY COMING SOUTH INTO THE PROPERTY. BUT OTHER THAN THAT, I MEAN, IT IS REALLY, ALL WE HAVE DONE EFFECTIVELY IS WE HAVE BASICALLY EFFECTIVELY GIVEN SOME OF THE PEOPLE BEHIND HERE A LITTLE BIT BIGGER BACKYARD. BECAUSE WE HAVE MOVED THE SCREEN WALL A LITTLE B BAC SO THAT CEPTION  TT THEHAVE WITH YOU BEHIND THEIR HOUSES. BUT THAT IS THE LONG SHORT OF IT.
00:18:52.949: >> ALL RIGHT. VERY GOOD. THANK YOU.
00:18:57.153: >> YEP. AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS.
00:18:59.856: >> EXCELLENT. MR. CAR, DID YOU HAVE A STAFF REPORT?
00:19:05.428: >> I DID NOT HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD. I WANTED TO INTRODUCE DAMIEN, WHO IS WITH TO US DEVELOPMENT. AS WELL AS SCOTT BESSEL WHO IS WITH MCI. HE DID A GOOD JOB SUMMARIZING THE PROPOSAL AND WE WILL HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS.
00:19:21.978: >> VERY GOOD. ALL RIGHT. I WILL OPEN THE PUBLIC HEARING THAN. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PERSONS TO SPEAK FOR UP TO THREE MINUTES ABOUT THE PONTIAC TRAIL LANDSCAPE MODIFICATION. PUBLIC COMMENT CAN BE MADE BY CALLING (877)853-5247. AND THEN ENTERING MEETING I.D. 9-291-620-2435. CITY STAFF WILL SELECT THE COLORS THAT HAVE RAISED THEIR HAND ONE BY ONE USING THE LAST THREE DIGITS OF YOUR TELEPHONE NUMBER IN ORDER TO ELECTRONICALLY INDICATE THAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN SPEAKING AND RACE THAT HAND. PLEASE PRESS STAR NINE ON YOUR TELEPHONE. YOU WILL HEAR AN AUTOMATED ANNOUNCEMENT ONCE THE HOST IS ALLOWING YOU TO SPEAK.

00:20:30.980: >> THE PHONE NUMBER MEETING WITH 134. YOU CAN PRESS STAR SIX TO UNMUTE YOUR PHONE AND ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
00:20:45.027: >> COLLAR WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING IN 134, THERE YOU ARE.
00:20:49.398: >> Caller: THANK YOU, MR. LEONARD CHAIR MILLS. THIS IS KEN. SO THIS IS MY OLD NEIGHBORHOOD. I WAS OVER THERE TODAY VISITING ED DAWSON, A FRIEND OF MINE WHO LIVES AT 473 SKY DEAL. WE NOTICED THE PROPOSED CHANGE IS ALREADY DONE. THE CONFLICTING LAND-USE BUFFER APPEARS TO BE SET WILL BACK FROM THE PROPERTY LINE AND THE ELECTRIC LINE PPE. AND IT LOOKS LIKE PPE HAS ITS RIGHT AWAY ALREADY -- RIGHT OF WAY ALREADY. AS WE SEE IT, I MEAN, WE DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT CHANGE. JUST A QUESTION ABOUT THE PROCESS. IT APPEARS THE PETITIONER WENT ABOUT DOING THIS AND AT SOME POINT MANY MONTHS AGO, AND ONLY NOW IS GETTING AROUND TO CHANGING THE OUTSIDE PLAN BY PETITIONING THE PLANNING COMMISSION. AGAIN, NO PROBLEM WITH THE ACTUAL CHANGES AS FAR AS I CAN SEE ALTHOUGH IT APPEARS VERY PUNY BEHIND THOSE FIVE HOUSES. COMPARED TO FURTHER EAST TOWARDS THE PONTIAC TRAIL AREA. AND I'M NOT SURE THAT NEIGHBORS WITH A GREAT THAT THEY ARE GETTING A LARGER BACKYARD. JUST A QUESTION ABOUT THE PROCESS. THIS APPEARS TO BE ASKING FOR PERMISSION AFTER THE FACT. THANK YOU.
00:22:21.290: >> THANK YOU. IF ANYONE ELSE WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION FOR THE PUBLIC HEARING, PLEASE PRESS STAR NINE. ON YOUR TELEPHONE.
00:22:36.906: >> CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING IN 404, YOU CAN UNMUTE YOUR PHONE USING STAR SIX AND ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
00:22:52.922: >> COLLAR WITH THAT PHONE NUMBER ENDING IN 404, IT IS STAR SIX ON YOUR PHONE TO UNMUTE. THERE YOU GO.
00:23:03.466: >> Caller: HI. HELLO, EVERYBODY. I JUST WANTED TO ASK, IS THERE SOMETHING NEW THAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN AS A RESULT OF THIS MOTION ON OUR STREETS OR ON THE EASEMENT BEHIND OUR HOUSE IS OR HAS IT ALREADY OCCURRED? THANK YOU.
00:23:21.250: >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IF ANYONE ELSE WISHES TO PROVIDE COMMENT DURING THE PUBLIC HEARING, IT IS STAR NINE ON YOUR PHONE TO INDICATE THAT. ALL RIGHT. I'M SEEING NO ADDITIONAL HANDS. I WILL GO AHEAD AND READ THE PROPOSED NOTION. THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION HEREBY APPROVES THE PROPOSED LANDSCAPE MODIFICATIONS ACCORDING TO THE UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE SECTION 5.3.2 LANDSCAPE MODIFICATION. MOVED BY COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT. DISCUSSION OF THE MOTION. COMMISSIONER DISH.
00:24:11.333: >> THIS IS MY WARD AND IT IS MY NEIGHBORHOOD. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF THE TREES HAVE ALREADY BEEN MOVED. I AGREE THAT IT IS NOT -- IT DOES NOT SEEM LIKE A TERRIBLE CHANGE TOOK OF THE PLAN. IT IS NICE TO GET APPROVAL BEFORE DOING THINGS. THE OTHER QUESTION I WOULD LIKE TO ASK IS, WHAT WILL THE EASEMENT ACTUALLY LOOK LIKE? WILL IT BE GRASS? AND WHO WILL MAINTAIN IT?
00:24:41.363: >> THAT SOUNDS LIKE IT IS PROBABLY THE PETITIONER.
00:24:46.368: >> HI, GOOD AFTERNOON. THIS IS DAMIEN, MAIN STREET LAFAYETTE, INDIANA. AS FAR AS THE PROCESS GOES, WE ACTUALLY LIKE SCOTT MENTIONED WE DID NOT HAVE A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY IN WHAT DTE WOULD ALLOW US. THE EASEMENT WERE ALREADY IN PLACE. WE ARE UTILIZING SOME EXISTING SERVICES THERE. THERE'S A 6-FOOT EASEMENT IN THE PREVIOUS TO THIS NEGOTIATION WITH DTE. WHEAT WHY DIDN'T THE EASEMENT AND THEN YOU ARE CORRECT. WE DID PLANT SOME TREES KIND OF IN ANTICIPATION OF THIS TO KEEP ON SCHEDULE. WE KNOW THEY ARE TREES. TREES CAN BE MOVED. BUT IT WAS ALREADY IN PLACE. SO WE KIND OF HAVE JUST EXTENDED THAT EASEMENT, IF YOU WILL. AND THEN YOUR SECOND QUESTION, OH, YES. WE ARE PROPOSING KIND OF -- IF YOU WILL. THE REASON BEING, IF DTE DOES IN D-- INDEED HAVE TO HAVE THEIR.
00:25:51.700: >> THAT THEY HAVE A DRIVABLE SERVICE. THEY CAN DRIVE OVER THE TOP OF THAT.
00:25:56.038: >> AND WHO WILL MOW IT?
00:25:59.675: >> WE WOULD. WE RUN AND MANAGE OUR OWN PROPERTIES.
00:26:03.145: >> THANK YOU.
00:26:04.647: >> SURE. THANK YOU.
00:26:06.315: >> ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR DISCUSSION? MR. LEONARD.
00:26:15.024: >> TO THE PRESS HIS QUESTION, -- PROCESS QUESTION, PART OF THE CHANGE IS THAT, IT WENT WE GO INSPECT THE SITE AND IT DIFFERS FROM THE APPROVED SITE PLAN, IT WOULD NOT BE APPROVED. SO THEM TAKING THAT WORK BEING CONDUCTED IN ANTICIPATION OF APPROVAL OR NOT IS SORT OF AT RISK OF THE PETITIONER. SO I JUST, YOU KNOW, FROM A PROCESS PERSPECTIVE, I GUESS I FUNDAMENTALLY THIS CASE IT IS NOT LIKE IT WAS IMPACTING OTHER NATURAL FEATURES OR THE LIKE. SO THAT WAS SORT OF AT THEIR BEHEST TO DO THAT. IF FOR SOME REASON YOU WERE NOT TO APPROVE LANDSCAPE MODIFICATION. THEY WOULD TO ALTER THE SITE OR FIGURE OUT SOME OTHER REASON. BUT I DON'T PERSONALLY SEE THE TIMING OF IT AS A CRITICAL QUESTION AS ULTIMATELY THE APPROVED PLAN REFLECTING WHAT IS ANTICIPATED.
00:27:14.316: >> SO JUST TO FOLLOW ON TOP OF THAT THERE WERE NOT OTHER EXISTING NATURAL FEATURES THAT WERE IN ROUGHLY THE SAME LOCATION THAT WERE IMPACTED BY PLANTING THESE NEW TREES THAT IF WE DECIDED, NO, NOT TO PROVE THERE'S A THEY WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK AND PLANT THAT PINK TREES AND THEY WOULD HAVE THESE ONES AS WELL POTENTIALLY, HOWEVER THAT WORKS. IS THAT FAIR?
00:27:43.078: >> YEP.
00:27:43.345: >> OKAY. GOT IT. THAT HELPS. I HAVE A COUPLE OF OTHER QUESTIONS, BUT DOES ANYBODY ELSE HAVE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS? COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT?
00:27:54.923: >> I WILL EXTRA CONFIRM FOR THE EXTRA COLLAR NO ADDITIONAL CHANGES ARE BEING MADE. THAT IS THE RELOCATED TREES. THERE'S NO OTHER CHANGES THAT ARE HAPPENING ON THAT. BASED ON A PRESUMPTIVE GUESS TONIGHT.
00:28:12.374: >> THAT SOUNDS LIKE IT IS TOP OF THE PETITIONER. SO -- TOUCH AT THE PETITIONER. SO --
00:28:20.315: >> IF I UNDERSTOOD THE QUESTION, YOU ARE WANTING TO BE SICKLY ENSURE THAT IF THE PLAN APPROVED TONIGHT WOULD BE CONSTRUCTED AS DESIGNED, CORRECT?
00:28:32.861: >> YES, IT IF IT HAS BEEN CONSTRUCTED. IS THAT CORRECT?
00:28:37.866: >> YES, YEAH, IT IS WELL ON ITS WAY. REALLY WHAT HAPPENS IS WE JUST TOOK THE SAME NUMBER OF TREES AND MOVED THEM NORTH. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT REPLANTING TREES IS WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT DOING.
00:28:51.180: >> YES, SO I'M JUST CONFIRMING FOR THAT CALLER. THEY SEE THAT THERE'S THIS REQUEST FOR, YOU KNOW, AN AMENDMENT. SO WHAT IS THERE IS THERE. WE ARE GOOD. NOTHING IS CHANGING OR MOVING.
00:29:08.730: >> CORRECT. I GREAT WITH THAT STATEMENT.
00:29:11.133: >> THANK YOU.
00:29:12.234: >> IS IT TRUE. FOLDING UP, THE PLANTINGS, HOWEVER MANY TREES WE ARE TALKING ABOUT KEPT HAVE BEEN PLANTED. -- ABOUT, HAVE BEEN PLANTED.
00:29:24.279: >> WE HAVE ONGOING LANDSCAPING TO THE PROPERTY. BUT YES, YOU ARE CORRECT. WHAT IS THERE IN THAT EASEMENT AREA AS PLANTED WOULD NOT CHANGE OTHER THAN US JUST DOING SOME FINAL GRADING AND SEEDING AND THINGS LIKE THAT. BUT YET. AND THIS IS KIND OF FOLDING ON. AT THAT. SO IT SOUNDS LIKE WHAT I HEARD YOU SAY IS THAT THE CAROLINE'S WERE ALREADY THERE. BUT PART OF THE PLAN ALSO INCLUDED THIS BERM. WAS THE BERM THERE BEFORE? HOW DOES THAT INTERSECT WITH THE EASEMENT? WHERE IS IT IN RELATIONSHIP TO THE EASEMENT?
00:30:03.185: >> SCOTT, ARE YOU STILL ON?
00:30:04.853: >> I'M HERE. YOU GUYS GOT ME?
00:30:08.991: >> WE DO. GO AHEAD.
00:30:10.092: >> YES. THE BERM WAS NOT THERE AT ALL. THE BERM WAS THE BERM THAT WE PUT THERE AS PART OF THE BUFFER BETWEEN THE RESIDENTS TOOK OF THE SOUTH. IT IS NOT A GIANT BERM. IT IS NOT LIKE A GRAVEL. BUT THAT IS ALL WE COULD GET IN THAT AREA AND THE TREES SIT AMONG THAT BERM AREA. BUT YEAH, THE TREES WERE PLANTED BASICALLY FIRST YEAR BECAUSE THEY WERE DELIVERED TO THE SITE AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME THAT DETROIT EDISON STARTS AT LET US KNOW THAT WE NEEDED TO GIVE THEM ACCESS THERE. THERE WERE ON THEIR WAY. THEY HAD TO PUT IN T GROD OR EY WOULDIE. SOE JUST ECTEDO PUT TM INHEROUN WRE WE THOUGHT THAT WE HAD PRETTY GOOD SHOT THAT THEY WOULD END UP BEING IF WE HAD TO MOVE THEM INTO THE SPRING. SO BE IT.
00:31:07.482: >> SO IS THE BERM -- MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROPER LINE IS THAT THE EASEMENT IS ALONG THE SOUTHERN PROPERTY LINE. IS THE BERM LIKE, ALONG WITH THAT? OR IS IT NORTH OF THE EASEMENT AND THEN THE TREES -- WHAT ORDER DOES IT GO IN?
00:31:27.970: >> THE BERM IS WITHIN THE EASEMENT. IT USED TO BE 6 FEET FROM THE COMMON PROPERTY LINE ENTIRELY ONTO THE PROJECT. NOW THAT EASEMENT IS 12 FEET ENTIRELY ON THE PROJECT. THE BERM IS WITHIN THAT AREA.
00:31:43.552: >> GOT IT. OKAY. JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE FROM KIND OF WHAT WAS THERE BEFORE. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS? ALL RIGHT. COMMISSIONER LEE?
00:32:01.069: >> YES. FOR LOOKING AT THIS EASEMENT, HOW ARE THEY EXACTLY GETTING IT? ARE THEY TURNING OFF INTO THE DRIVEWAY AND HUGGING THE PROPERTY LINE, LIKE, DOWN SOUTH AND IN EASTWARD PUT I'M LOOKING AT THIS PACKAGE RIGHT NOW. I JUST WANT TO NO, PRACTICALLY SPEAKING, HOW THEY ARE GETTING . I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED HERE. JUST FOR WHERE WE ARE ON STANDING, I DON'T SEE ANY MATERIAL ISSUES WITH THIS, OTHER THAN A THANK YOU TO, AND GARBER FOR OBSOLETE EYES ON THE STREET THAT IS OBVIOUSLY VERY HELPFUL FOR US. PRACTICALLY SPEAKING, OH, I SEE. PERFECT. KIND OF TURN OFF THIS EASEMENT COME ITSELF AND THEN SERVICE. IS THAT CORRECT?
00:32:56.258: >> THAT IS FOR THE PETITIONER.
00:32:56.892: >> THAT IS CORRECT. SORRY. THIS WAS NOT IN THE STAFF REPORT THAT I HAD. I HAVE NOT SEEN THAT. SO OVERALL, MATERIAL SPEAKING TO UNDERAGE OVER THE ISSUES WITH THIS. I JUST WANTED TO THANK MR. GARBER FOR BEING ABLE TO VISIT AND DO A SIDE -- SITE VERIFICATION. THAT IS IT FOR ME.
00:33:25.921: >> ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS? ALL RIGHT, MR. LEONARD, I THINK WE ARE READY FOR A VOTE. (ROLL BEING CALLED) MOTION CARRIES.
00:34:07.396: >> ALL RIGHT. VERY GOOD. ONTO -- SORRY?
00:34:13.135: >> THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.
00:34:14.536: >> ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU.
00:34:15.270: >> THANK YOU.
00:34:17.606: >> ONTO ITEM 9B. THIS IS THE 336 SOUTH ASHLEY PROPERTY WHICH IS THE LIBERTY CONSUMPTION ESTABLISHMENT OR PLANNING COMMISSION APPROVAL. ANOTHER THING WITH FINAL PLANNING COMMISSION APPROVAL. AGAIN, WE WILL HAVE THE PETITIONER PRESENTATION, THEN THE STAFF PRESENTATION, AND IN THE PUBLIC HEARING BEFORE OUR DISCUSSION.
00:34:45.167: >> ALL RIGHT, COMMISSIONER SYLVAN.
00:34:48.236: >> DID YOU GET DEMOTED?
00:34:49.905: >> NO. WHEN I'M MOVING PEOPLE AROUND THAT SOMETIMES THE LIST STARTS -- BECAUSE I'M JUST NOT -- (LAUGHTER)
00:35:00.749: >> ALL RIGHT. I GOT A PRETTY SIZABLE LIST. GIVE ME A MOMENT HERE TO GET EVERYONE --
00:35:05.854: >> NO PROBLEM.
00:35:11.726: >> COMMISSIONER LEE.
00:35:13.829: >> UH-HUH.
00:35:40.922: >> ALL RIGHT. IS THERE ANYBODY FROM THE PETITIONER'S TEAM THAT YOU'RE NOT SEEING THAT YOU SHOULD BE SEEING?
00:35:51.700: >> NOPE. OKAY.
00:35:53.568: >> ALL RIGHT. AND NOW --
00:35:56.071: >> I'M SORRY.
00:35:57.539: >> GO AHEAD.
00:35:58.273: >> I WAS JUST GOING TO SHARE, I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE MY SCREEN.
00:36:01.376: >> OKAY. THAT WAS MY NEXT QUESTION, SO YOU WERE --
00:36:04.446: >> RIGHT ON CUE.
00:36:06.948: >> THANK YOU.
00:36:14.756: >> IT SAYS THE HOST DISABLED SCREEN SHARING.
00:36:18.159: >> TRY IT NOW.
00:36:32.607: >> WE ARE SEEING IT, AND NOW IT IS IN FULL SCREEN. GREAT.
00:36:36.778: >> AWESOME.
00:36:41.349: >> CAN YOU HEAR ME OKAY?
00:36:42.717: >> WE CAN.
00:36:43.018: >> ALL RIGHT. HI, EVERYBODY. MY NAME IS RABBI JAMES CON, AND I AM THE DIRECTOR OF COMMUTING OUTREACH FOR LIBERTY CANNABIS. I WANT TO THANK THE COMMISSIONERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK THIS EVENING AND FOR YOUR COMMITMENT TO THE PUBLIC SERVICE AND TO THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE. I'M HERE TONIGHT TO REQUEST A SPECIAL EXCEPTION USED TO OPERATE IT DOES NEEDED MARIJUANA CONSUMPTION FACILITY AT 336 SOUTH ASHLEY STREET. DIRECTLY ADJACENT TO OUR EXISTING LIBERTY PROVISIONING AT RETAIL CENTER AT 338 SOUTH ASHLEY STREET. LIBERTY'S PROPOSED CONSUMPTION FACILITY WOULD BE THE FIRST OF ITS KIND IN ANN ARBOR. AND FOR THE STATE AS A WHOLE. HONESTLY, IT IS A HISTORIC OPPORTUNITY AND ONE THAT WE BELIEVE LIBERTY IS BEST SUITED TO BRING TO LIGHT. SHARON? NEXT SLIDE, PLEASE.
00:37:44.346: >> IT IS FROZEN.
00:37:47.215: >> YOU ALWAYS SEEM TO HAVE THIS PROBLEM.
00:37:49.517: >> HOLD ON.
00:37:53.521: >> WELL, I WILL TELL YOU ABOUT LIBERTY. LIBERTY WAS FOUNDED IN 2011 WHEN WE WERE AWARDED TWO OF SEVEN LICENSES TO CULTIVATE MEDICAL CANNABIS IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. FROM DAY ONE, WE HAVE BEEN ON A MISSION INSPIRED BY THE STORIES AND THE STRUGGLES OF COUNTLESS INDIVIDUALS, FAMILIES, AND COMMUNITIES WHO HAVE BEEN POSITIVELY IMPACTED BY THE CANNABIS PLANT. ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE IS THIS YOUNG MAN, JACKSON. I FIRST MET JACKSON WHEN HE WAS EIGHT YEARS OLD. HE HAD BEEN RECENTLY DIAGNOSED AND TRACTABLE EPILEPSY. WHICH MEANS TRADITIONAL MEDICATIONS NO LONGER WORK TO CONTROL HIS SEIZURES. ON THE DAY WE MET JACKSON HAD ALREADY HAD MORE THAN A DOZEN SEIZURES AND IT WAS ONLY KNOWN. HE HAD BEEN HOSPITALIZED MORE THAN 50 TIMES JUST THE PAST TWO YEARS. AND HIS MOM, LISA CUTTER LED AN ADVOCACY GROUP COMPOSED OF 50 DC MOMS ALL SEEKING AXES TO NON-PSYCHOACTIVE CANNABIS MEDICINE RICH IN CBD AND THC A. IT COULD ONLY BE OBTAINED IN CALIFORNIA COLORADO. AT THE REQUEST OF JACKSON AND HIS MOM, LIBERTY COMMITTED TO PRODUCING THE MEDICATION LOCALLY. AND JACKSON BECAME THE VERY FIRST MINOR ENROLLED IN DC'S MEDICAL CANNABIS PROGRAM. OUR STUFF WORKED WITH JACKSON'S DR. US TO DEVELOP A PROPRIETARY MEDICATION WHICH WE NAMED JACKSON'S COURAGE WHICH WE GAVE TO ALL 50 FAMILIES AT NO COST. INFECTED WE CONTINUE TO GIVE JACKSON'S COURAGE TO PEDIATRIC PATIENTS IN DC AT NO COST. THE RESULTS WERE FANTASTIC. JACKSON'S COURAGE HAD -- IT WAS NOT A PROFESSIONAL STUDY, BUT AMONGST THE FOLKS THAT WE SURVEYED, HAD AN 80% PLUS SUCCESS RATE IN EITHER PRODUCING SEIZURES OR IN SOME CASES ELIMINATING THEM COMPLETELY. JACKSON WAS ABLE TO RETURN HOME AND IS NO AN HONOR ROLL STUDENT. AND FOR US TO THIS STORY IS AT THE HEART OF WHO WE ARE AS A COMPANY. I WANTED TO TELL YOU WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE IN ANN ARBOR. ON A NATIONAL LEVEL, THAT MEANS SHAPING AN ETHICAL CANNABIS INDUSTRY, ONE THAT APPEARS BUSINESS SUCCESS WITH THE COMMITMENT TO THE MISSION. UNTESTED LEVEL, WE HAVE A FIVE YEAR TRACK RECORD IN MICHIGAN WITH LOCATIONS IN DETROIT AND ANN ARBOR AND A NEW CAMPUS OPENING IN MADISON HEIGHTS IN EARLY JUNE. ON A LOCAL LEVEL, INVESTING IN ANN ARBOR WITH OUR PROFICIENT CENTER AND NOW IT WAS OUR PROPOSED CONSUMPTION LOUNGE, MEANS MORE STAFF, ALL HIRED FROM THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY, MAKING A LIVABLE WAGE WITH GOOD BENEFITS THAT INCLUDE HEALTHCARE AND -- AND ON A PERSONAL LEVEL, ON A PERSONAL LEVEL, MANY OF OUR OWNERS, BOARD MEMBERS, AND STAFF CALL ANN ARBOR HOME. AND MANY OTHERS ARE PASSIONATE U OF M ALARM. -- ALUM. THE CONSUMPTION FACILITY IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF OUR CONTINUED LOCAL INVESTMENT. RESPONDING TO THE NEEDS OF OUR CUSTOMERS WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY CREATING NEW JOBS. THE GOAL OF LIBERTY'S PROPOSED CONSUMPTION LOUNGE ARE MULTIFACETED. WE WISH TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO CANNABIS. FOR WHAT MANY OF OUR CUSTOMERS, HAVING A SAFE SPACE TO CONSUME CANNABIS CAN BE A REAL CHALLENGE. THOSE WHO LIVE IN PUBLIC HOUSING OR RENT COULD FACE POSSIBLE EVICTION FOR USING CANNABIS IN THEIR HOMES. WE ALSO SEEK TO BUILD A SUPPORTIVE COMMUNITY. CONSIDER THOSE WHO MAKE KNOWN THEIR OWN HOME WHO LIVE ALONE AND MAY WISH TO EXPERIMENT WITH CANNABIS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A SAFE AND SUPPORTIVE ENVIRONMENT. PEOPLE WHO CAN EDUCATE THEM ABOUT CANNABIS USE. AND WE ARE ALSO TRYING TO ENHANCE OUR EXISTING OFFERINGS AND THE EXPERIENCE OF OUR EXISTING FACILITIES. REALLY TRYING TO CREATE A COMMUNITY AND RECOGNIZING THAT OUR LOCATION WHICH IS ACCESS TO LOTS OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION AND REALLY VERY FEW PATIENTS WHO DRIVE THAT DELETE OUR LOCATION IS IDEAL TO SERVE. AS THE CITY'S FIRST CONSUMPTION LOUNGE FOR CANNABIS. I SHOULD NOTE THAT THE PICTURES THAT YOU ARE SITTING ON THE ACTS LIKE THIS EX-ATHLETE NOT A RENDERING OF OUR ANN ARBOR FACILITY. BUT ABSOLUTELY CAPTURES THE SPIRIT OF THE SAFE AND ENJOYABLE SPACE THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE CREATING AND ANN ARBOR. SAFETY AND SECURITY ARE OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE TO US. NOT JUST THE SECURITY OF OUR PROMISES, BUT ALSO HOW WE ENSURE THE SECURITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND ALSO, IT IS PROBABLY A GOOD TIME TO NOTE THAT ALL OF OUR PLANS ARE COVID CONTINGENT WHICH WE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT IN EVERY ASPECT OF OUR OPERATIONS. I'M HAPPY TO GO INTO THAT IN A LATER TIME. RESPONSIBLE PLANNING. SO WE PUT A LOT OF ATTENTION IN THE OUTSIDE LIGHTING, INTO THAT MAINTENANCEF OUR SIDEWALKS AND TO PRENTING THGS LE DOLE PARNG AND LOITERING AND LITTERING AND OUTSIDE CONSUMPTION. IN ADDITION TO, YOU KNOW, A LOT OF DISK THAT YOU WILL ABLE TO READ ABOUT IN OUR PACKET. IN ADDITION TO WHAT I HAVE JUST NOTED HERE, I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO TELL YOU THAT RESERVATIONS WILL BE REQUIRED AT THIS FACILITY. THEY WILL BE AND 45 MINUTE BLOCKS. HOURS WILL BE FROM NOON TO IT O'CLOCK P.M. WAS THE LAST RESERVATION AT 7:15. PATRONS MUST HAVE PURCHASED MARIJUANA PRODUCTS FROM THE ADJACENT LIBERTY RETAIL AND PROVISIONING CENTER WHICH MEANS NO NEW TRAFFIC TRIP GENERATION. THIS IS A SERVICE FOR EXISTING CUSTOMERS. THAT RECEIVED IS GOING TO SERVE AS THEIR ENTRY TICKETS INTO THE CONSUMPTION FACILITY. LET ME STRESSED THAT THERE ARE MANY DETAILS WHICH YOU CAN READ ABOUT IN OUR PACKET. WANT THAT WE ARE ESPECIALLY PROUD ABOUT, ESPECIALLY PROUD OF IN WHICH WE KNOW IS OF IMPORTANCE TO OUR NEIGHBORS IS OUR ODOR CONTROL PROGRAM. MOST IMPORTANT TO NOTE IS THAT WE HAVE DEVELOPED A CUSTOM ODOR CONTROL, AND SMOKE REMOVAL SYSTEM THAT WILL MAKE CANNABIS VOTERS UNDETECTABLE THE STREET. IT IS CUSTOM, CREATED BY HIGH-TECH ENVIRONMENTS OF TROY IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE MECHANICAL ENGINEERS AND ARCHITECTS HAROLD OF DESIGN TEAM PLUS. WHILE HAROLD IS ON THE CALL AND IS AVAILABLE TO THE ANSWER COMPLEX QUESTIONS, THE PLANT TAKES A THREE-PRONGED APPROACH. FIRST, WE ARE MAKING STRUCTURAL IMPROVEMENTS TO THE BUILDING. ESSENTIALLY CREATING A HERMETICALLY SEALED SPACE. SECOND, WE WILL BE PRECISELY CONTROLLING AND MONITORING AIRFLOW WITHIN THE SPACE, CREATING NEGATIVE AIR PRESSURE AND AIR CURTAINS AT THE DOOR WITH THAT WILL COMPLETELY PREVENT ANY AIRBORNE PARTICULATES ESCAPING. AND LASTLY, BY UTILIZING A STATE-OF-THE-ART AIR FILTRATION SYSTEM, ODOR AND SMOKE REMOVAL SYSTEM WILL BE ABLE TO SCRUB THE AIR OF ANY ODOROUS GAS, ANY SMELLS.
00:45:24.772: >> 90 SECONDS REMAINING.
00:45:25.907: >> I'M GOING TO WRAP UP BY TAKING THE COMMUNITY FOR SUPPORTING US OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS. THE GREATEST TESTAMENT TO OUR SUCCESS ARE THE DETAILED LETTERS OF SUPPORT. THEY HAVE WITNESSED OUR COMMITMENT TO BEING A GOOD NEIGHBOR AND A RESPONSIBLE VENDOR OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS. SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE SEEN AS THIS PAST WEEKEND INSTALLING THIS DOG WASTE STATION AND STEWARDING THE OVERGROWN PROPERTY NEXT TO THIS SITE. LET ME JUST SAY THAT WE HAVE PROVIDED A VERY COMPREHENSIVE APPLICATION WHICH INCLUDES A DETAILED ANALYSIS OF HOW WE HAVE MET EACH OF THE CRITERIA OF THIS ORDINANCE AND IN ADDITION, WE DO INTEND TO ENCLOSE THE PORCH AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE SO WE WOULD RESPECTIVELY REQUEST THAT THE SQUARE FOOTAGE NOT BE LIMITED TO PUT THE INTERIOR AS WE WOULD LIKE TO BE CERTAIN THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO USE THE PORCH AREA AS AN ENCLOSED SPACE SUBJECT TO -- OR CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL. AGAIN, THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY AND FOR YOUR SERVICE AND WE HAVE AN ENTIRE TEAM HERE READY AND WILLING AND EXCITED TO ADDRESS ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU.
00:46:36.677: >> THANK YOU. DO WE -- WAS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WANTED TO ADD FROM THE STAFF PERSPECTIVE?
00:46:50.424: >> YES, THANK YOU. I WAS -- I AM HAVING SCREEN OVERLOAD. SORRY. I WILL COVER A FEW -- THANK YOU. LET ME TOUCH ON SOME THINGS IN THE STAFF REPORT HAVING TO DO WITH STANDARDS OF APPROVAL. AS VERY WELL DESCRIBED. THIS IS A SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE A REQUEST FOR A DESIGNATED MARIJUANA CONSUMPTION FACILITY. THE SITE IS ON D2. IT IS ABOUT 3,000 SQUARE-FOOT SITE. THEY WILL BE USING THE EXISTING BUILDING. SPECIAL EXCEPTION USES ARE SUBJECT TO THE GENERAL CRITERIA PROVIDED IN THE UDC. THEY COVERED SUCH THINGS AS COMPATIBILITY AND CONSISTENCY WITH THE MASTER-PLANNED. COMPATIBILITY WITH THE GENERAL FACILITY. CONSISTENCY WITH THE NEIGHBORHOOD. ADEQUATE PARKING AND GENERAL CIRCULATION AND PEDESTRIAN SAFETY. AND THE LEFT -- NO IMPACTED NATURAL FEATURE. THE COMMISSION MAY BE FAMILIAR THAT THERE ARE ADDITIONAL STANDARDS FOR OTHER TYPES OF MARIJUANA FACILITIES SUCH AS PROVISIONING CENTERS. THERE ARE NOT -- THEY ARE NOT FOR THE CONSUMPTION FACILITIES. HOWEVER, THE APPLICANTS HAVE ADDRESSED THOSE OTHER STANDARDS FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE REVIEW AND OF THE PLANNING COMMISSION. THEY HAVE PROVIDED MATERIALS THAT DESCRIBE THE DELIVERY PROCEDURES. FOR PLANS, SO ON AND SO FORTH. ODOR CONTAINMENT WHICH THEY ALSO PRESENTED. WITH DISPOSAL AND HOURS OF OPERATION. WE HAVE FOUND THAT THE APPLICATION MEETS THE STANDARDS OF APPROVAL FOR SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE. WE HAVE PROVIDED A DETAILED MOTION FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. AND I WOULD ONLY CLOSE BY SAYING THAT THIS HAS BEEN REVIEWED BY OTHER STAFF AS WELL. AND ALL RECOMMEND APPROVAL.
00:49:01.422: >> VERY GOOD. I WILL THEN OPEN THE PUBLIC HEARING FOR THIS PETITION. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PERSONS TO SPEAK FOR UP TO THREE MINUTES ABOUT THE PROPOSED DOES NEEDED CONSUMPTION FACILITY, SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE PERMIT AT 336 SOUTH ASHLEY. PUBLIC COMMENT MAY BE MADE BY CALLING (877)853-5247 AND THEN ENTERING MEETING I.D. 9-291-620-2435. CITY STAFF WILL SELECT COLORS THAT HAVE RAISED THEIR HAND ONE BY ONE.

00:50:19.934: >> WE GOT A FEW MOMENTS, PLEASE.
00:50:21.902: >> SURE. I DON'T HAVE A GUITAR TO PLAY BUT WE WILL NOTED THAT THERE WERE A NUMBER OF LETTERS IN OUR PACKET IN TERMS OF COMMUNICATIONS ABOUT FACILITY.
00:50:41.522: >> NOTE INDICATIONS. EXPECT I WILL CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING AND READ THE VERY LONG MOTION. IT CAN POST INCLUDES THE CONDITIONS.
00:50:49.797: >> WAIT.
00:50:50.064: >> OH. ALL RIGHT.
00:50:56.103: >> CALLER THE NUMBER ENDING IN 181. YOU CAN UNMUTE YOUR PHONE USING STAR SIX AND ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
00:51:04.178: >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I AM WITH 210 WEST WILLIAM. I AM NEIGHBORING THE LIBERTY OF PROVISIONING CENTER. AND WE WOULD JUST LIKE TO OFFER SOME COMMENTS ABOUT THE PROPOSAL. YOU KNOW, FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, THAT THE INCREASE IN TRAFFIC FLOW HAS BEEN EXCEPTIONAL. THAT WHEN WE LOOK AT WHAT USED TO BE IF REQUIRED ABILITY TO SIT ON OUR PORCH, IN THE BACKYARD, IT HAS BECOME VERY NOSY AND CERTAINLY -- NOW, PART OF THIS IS THE FLOW OF TRAFFIC THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE ENTERING THIS BUSINESS ARE ENTERING FROM THE REAR. THEY MOVED TO THE BUILDING AND INTO THE FRONT. AND SO THAT CREATES CERTAINLY, YOU KNOW, FOR MORE PEOPLE THERE TO BASICALLY LOOK AT AND BASICALLY, YOU KNOW, RESEARCH OUR PRIVACY AS WELL. THIRDLY, THAT IS ONE ASPECT OF THIS. I THINK AS WE THINK ABOUT, YOU KNOW, WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS? IT IS REALLY ABOUT, YOU KNOW, TAKING MORE MONEY. AND SO HAVING A CONSUMPTION CENTER NEARBY ALLOWS YOU TO MAKE MORE PROFITS. I DON'T SEE THIS AS REALLY SOMETHING THAT IS EVEN TEDIOUS. THERE ARE MANY PLACES TO CONSUME MARIJUANA. THERE DOES NOT NEED TO BE ONE HERE. THEREFORE, IT IS BASICALLY A CONSUMPTION TOWARDS THE -- AND LASTLY, WE TALKED ABOUT THIS. YOU KNOW, THERE'S CONCERNS ABOUT THE ELDERS. THEY DESIGNED A GREAT ODOR CONTROL SYSTEM. AND EXPOSES PEOPLE WHO DON'T WANT TO BE EXPOSED TO IT MARIJUANA VOTERS. YOU HAVE GOT A SCHOOL SYSTEM THAT IS CLOSE BY. YOU GOT LOTS OF TRAFFIC GOING BY PART AT THIS POINT MAKE INTEMPERATE YOU GOT A SITUATION WHERE BASICALLY PEOPLE HAVE CONSUMED AND OTHERS ARE GOING BACK OUT INTO THE PUBLIC IN THIS LOCATION. WHICH, KNOW, POSES ADDITIONAL SECURITY RISK FOR THOSE WHO LIVE NEARBY. SO THANKS VERY MUCH FOR ALLOWING ME TO COMMENT.
00:53:07.835: >> THANK YOU.
00:53:11.906: >> DO I HAVE A CHANCE TO RESPOND, ORONO.
00:53:13.807: >> YOU DO NOT, BUT THERE MAY BE QUESTIONS DIRECTLY TO YOU DURING OUR DISCUSSION. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE THAT WISHES TO SPEAK DURING THE PUBLIC COMMENTS? IF SO, PLEASE PRESS STAR NINE ON YOUR TELEPHONE TO INDICATE THAT. I'M GOING TO TRY TO START READING THAT MOTION AGAIN. IF THEY HAD POPS UP, STOP ME, MR. LEONARD. THE MOTION READS, THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION AFTER HEARING ALL INTERESTED PERSONS AND REVIEWING ALL RELEVANT INFORMATION, INCLUDING AN ACCOMPANIED SITE PLAN FINDS THE PETITIONS MEETS THAT DEFINITION IN CHAPTER 55 UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE. SECTION 5.29.5. D SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS. SECTION 5.16.3. G WHERE ONE OF FACILITY. THEREFORE APPROVES THE 336 SOUTH ASHLEY STREET SPECIAL EXCEPTION IS FOR DOES NEED MARIJUANA CONSUMPTION FACILITY. THIS APPROVAL IS BASED ON THE FOLLOWING FINDINGS. ONE, AT THE PROPOSED USE WILL BE CONSISTENT WITH THE DOWNTOWN INTERFACE DISTRICT. WHICH PROVIDES FOR RESIDENTIAL OFFICE AND COMMERCIAL USES. INCLUDING SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS FOR DESIGNATED MARIJUANA CONSUMPTION FACILITIES. THE PROPOSED USE WILL NOT ADVERSELY IMPACT TRAFFIC PEDESTRIAN BICYCLIST CIRCULATION OR WROTE INTERSECTIONS RESPOND TO LOCATION. SOUTH ASHLEY STREET PROVIDES ACCESS TO THE SITE AND THE PROPOSED USE IS CONSISTENT WITH OTHER SURROUNDING USES. THREE, A SITE PLAN DOCUMENTING THE EXISTING AND PROPOSED CONDITIONS OF THE SITE HAS BEEN SUBMITTED AS PART OF THIS APPLICATION. FOUR, THREE DOCUMENTATIONS SUBMITTED BY THE PETITIONER REGARDING WAIT DISPOSAL, INVENTORY TRAFFIC. SECURITY AND OTHER METHODS OF OPERATION OF THE SYNDICATE THAT DOES NEEDED MARIJUANA CONSUMPTION FACILITY WILL BE OPERATED IN A MANNER THAT WILL NOT HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD NEIGHBORING PROPERTIES OR AREA. AND WILL NOT HAVE A JUDGMENTAL IMPACT ON NATURAL FEATURES. THIS SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE APPROVAL IS BASED ON THE FOLLOWG CONDITIONS. ON THE PETITIOR OBTAINING ANMAINTAININ BOTH STATE OF MICHAN MARIJUANA LICSE AND A CITY OF ANN ARBOR IT MAJUANA PERMIT. AND PROVIDING DOCUMENTATION TO THE PLANNING SERVICES WITHIN REACH YEARS OF THE CITY PLANNING COMMISSION APPROVAL DATE OF THIS PETITION. TWO AT THE PETITIONER OPERATING EVERYONE A BUSINESS AT THIS ADDRESS WITHIN THREE YEARS OF THE CITY PLANNING COMMISSION APPROVAL DATE OF THIS PETITION. THREE, THE DOES NEEDED MARIJUANA CONSUMPTION FACILITY MAY ONLY BE USED BY CUSTOMERS AND THEIR GUESTS OF THE PROVISIONING CENTER/RETAIL AT 338 SOUTH ASHLEY STREET. AND THAT THE ANN ARBOR PLANNING COMMISSION APPROVES THE ATTACHED SITE PLAN WHICH DEMONSTRATES COMPLIANCE WITH THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE STANDARDS AS NO DEVELOPMENT WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE REQUIRE SITE PLAN APPROVAL HAS BEEN PROPOSED. MOVED BY COMMISSIONER -- ANY DISCUSSION OF THE MOTION? THERE'S SO MANY SQUARES. I SAW COMMISSIONER SAUVE AND COMMISSIONER DISCH.
00:56:35.743: >> STAFF FIRST. THE CONSUMPTION FACILITY VERSUS DISTRIBUTION AND THE -- REASON TO HAVE THEM SEPARATE AND WRITTEN INDEBTEDNESS REQUIRED TO PURCHASE FROM A PROVISIONING CENTER ONLY FOR CONSUMPTION AT THIS FACILITY.
00:56:53.360: >> WHY ARE THESE ONES TETHERED WHEN WE WROTE THEM AS TWO SEPARATE USES?
00:56:59.166: >> OKAY. FIRST, I THOUGHT YOUR QUESTION MIGHT BE, WHAT IS THE DIFF DIFFERENCE? THE DIFFERENCE HAVE MORE TO DO WITH THE STATE LAWS AND HOW THEY WERE INTRODUCED AND CLASSIFIED AND SO FORTH. THIS PARTICULAR ONE IS POSTED TO BE TIED AND CONNECTED SORT OF OPERATE ALMOST ACCESSORY SOLELY BECAUSE OF THE TRAFFIC -- THE TRAFFIC IMPACTS AND TRAFFIC CONSIDERATIONS. IT IS -- I DON'T THINK IT IS MY DAY. THE CONSUMPTION FACILITIES ARE TWO NEW OF A LAND USED TO HAVE MUCH DATA AT ALL ALONE ROBUST DATA BY THE INSTITUTE OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERS. AND THE -- THAT INSTITUTE OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERS HAVE AN ESTABLISHED PROCESS FOR COLLECTING THE DATA AND ANALYZING IT AND COMING UP WITH EITHER YOUR OWN DATA OR PROXIES. BUT IN LIEU  OF THAT EFFORT, ARE TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERS ON STAFF SAID COUPLE, IF THIS IS TRULY ACCESSORY, THEN SHE AGREES THAT THAT PROCESS IS NOT NECESSARY BECAUSE THE CONSUMPTION FACILITY WILL NOT BE GENERATING ANY ADDITIONAL TRAFFIC. IT IS WHAT I WAS TRYING TO SAY AND STUMBLING. IF WE HAD GONE THROUGH THIS PROCESS OF FIGURING, YOU KNOW, DETERMINING ALL OF THE TRAFFIC COUNTS AND THE PEAK HOUR TRIPS WITH TRAFFIC ANALYSIS -- MAYBE WE WOULD NOT BE AT THIS PLACE WHERE WE ARE SAYING THAT THE -- THERE SHOULD BE A CONDITION THAT IS TYING THEM TOGETHER. BUT IN LIEU OF THAT, IT WAS SORT OF THE EASIER WAY TO GO. AND I SHOULD SAY THAT IT WAS ALWAYS THEIR INTENTION. IT SEEM TO BE AN EASY WAY TO GO BECAUSE THEY CAN -- CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG, BUT IT WAS ALWAYS THEIR INTENTIONS THAT THEY OPERATE THEM AS SISTER BUSINESSES. IT IS NOT A REQUIREMENT. BUT THAT IS THEIR CHOSEN MODEL.
00:59:22.342: >> I SEE A LOT OF HEAD NODS ON THE PETITIONER SIDE AND I SEE MR. LEONARD'S HAND UP.
00:59:28.081: >> I JUST WANT TO WITHIN YOUR QUESTION, COMMISSIONER SAUVE AND THE RESPONSE, IS THAT I THINK FRANKLY THIS WAS AN UNANTICIPATED QUESTION. BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE BENEFIT OF LOOKING INTO THAT TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IT IS. IT HAS TO FOLLOW THAT PRESCRIBED SORT OF DATA ANALYSIS AND PRESENTATION AND VALIDATION OF WHAT IS BEING PROPOSED. I THINK AS THESE USES ARE CONSIDERED IN THE FUTURE WE WILL FACE SIMILAR QUESTIONS IF THEY ARE SORT OF VISION TO BE ACCESSORY. THAN THAT IS GOING TO BE AN OPTION. IF THEY ARE INTENDED TO BE SORT OF MORE ISOLATED OR PERHAPS EVEN JUST PHYSICALLY SEPARATED FROM A PROVISIONING CENTER. THAT IS PROBABLY GOING TO GOT THAT NECESSARY TO THE -- NECESSITY TO GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS TO PRESENT THE TRIP GENERATION IS GOING TO BE THROUGH ANALYSIS VERSUS JUST BEING ABLE TO RELY ON THE I.T.
01:00:28.976: >> GREAT. YEAH, BECAUSE IN ORDER TO -- WE ARE SEEING THAT BUNDLED. UNDERSTANDING THIS ONE VERSUS WHAT WE MAY SEE IN THE FUTURE. SO THAT IS HELPFUL. THANKS.
01:00:40.520: >> COMMISSIONER CLARKE -- SORRY, COMMISSIONER DISCH, AND THEN COMMISSIONER CLARKE.
01:00:45.759: >> , SO THIS WAS FAIRLY WELL EXPLAINED IN THE EXTENSIVE DOCUMENTATION. WE RECEIVED. I WANTED TO NOTE THAT I'M NOT EVEN SURE IF THIS IS A QUESTION. I JUST WANTED TO NOTE THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT JUMPED OUT AT ME AND ALL OF THE INFORMATION BESIDES THE INCREDIBLE DESCRIPTION OF YOUR ODOR CONTROL WHICH IS GREAT. QUITE AMAZING. BUT THIS IS A BIG INVESTMENT IN THIS PROPERTY. IT IS ALMOST $7,000. AND THE PROJECTED PROFIT IS 150,000 A YEAR. IN PART, I IMAGINE THAT IS BECAUSE PATRONAGE OF THIS PLACE IS LIMITED TO, WHO IS PURCHASING AT THAT CENTER NEXT DOOR. AND ALSO BECAUSE IT IS JUST ONE FLOOR. YOU ARE USING THE TOP FLOOR MANAGEMENT AND ADMINISTERED OF OFFICES. SO IT JUMPED OUT AT ME THAT THIS -- YOU ARE PUTTING A BIG INVESTMENT AND IT IS GOING TO TAKE YOU A LITTLE WHILE BETTER RECOUPED THAT. -- WHILE TO RECOUPED THAT. IF YOU HAD A COMMENT THAT YOU WANTED TO SAY OR IF OTHERS HAD THOUGHTS, I WOULD BE HAPPY TO HEAR THAT.
01:02:09.576: >> CAN I JUST -- YEAH WE TRULY SEE THIS AS A CONTINUATION OF OUR SUPPORT OF OUR CURRENT CUSTOMER BASE. AND WE SIMPLY BELIEVE THAT ACCESS TO CANNABIS IS -- THANKFULLY, IT IS NOW SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO HAVE. AND WHILE SOME PEOPLE HAVE THE BENEFIT OF BEING ABLE TO UTILIZE THEIR OWN HOMES TO THE CONSUMED THAT CANNABIS, NOT EVERYBODY HAS THAT OPPORTUNITY. AND IN FACT, WE OFTEN SEE ARRESTS GO UP IN STATES THAT LEGALIZE CANNABIS BECAUSE AN INCREASE IN ACCESS IS NOT MATCHED WITH AN INCREASE IN PLACES TO USE IT. AND SO OFTEN PEOPLE ARE USING IT IN PARKS OR OUTSIDE ON THE STREETS. AND UNFORTUNATELY, THE FOLKS THAT SEEM TO GET ARRESTED IN THOSE MOMENTS ARE OFTEN PEOPLE OF COLOR. SO IT REALLY BECOMES AN ISSUE OF RACIAL JUSTICE AS WELL. AND YEAH. THIS IS NOT A MONEYMAKING VENTURE FOR US. AGAIN, WE HOPE SO.
01:03:20.947: >> COMMISSIONER CLARKE?
01:03:25.352: >> I HAVE A QUESTION EN THE LANGUAGE. THERE WAS -- THAT LINE THAT SAYS THE CUSTOMERS AND THEIR GUESTS WILL BE ALLOWED ALONG WITH JUST INTERESTED DOES THAT MEAN THE GUESTS WILL BE ALLOWED TO CONSUME AS WELL? WILL THEY ALSO HAVE TO BE CUSTOMERS? I'M JUST CURIOUS. COULD YOU ELABORATE ON THAT?
01:03:48.975: >> I BELIEVE I CAN -- MY UNDERSTANDING AND I THINK IT IS REASONABLE. YOU CAN IMAGINE YOU MIGHT HAVE A SMALL GROUP OF -- YOU MIGHT GO WITH SOMEONE, ONLY ONE PERSON IS THAT PURCHASER. AND -- THE PURCHASER. AND SO IT IS, AGAIN, RELATED TO THE TRIPS. THERE MAY BE TWO PEOPLE IN THE SAME CAR OR TAKING THE SAME BUS. ONE PERSON IS ONLY ACTUALLY PURCHASING. AND SO THAT WAS JUST A WAY TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE GENERAL AND INCLUSIVE. BUT -- AND THAT WAS MY APPROACH. FOR THE SUGGESTED SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE CONDITION. IF YOU WANT FROM THE APPLICANT, THAT THEY COULD DESCRIBE MORE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMER POLICIES. BUT THAT WAS MY RELEVANCE TO THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION LAND USE CONDITION. AGAIN, BECAUSE AIR-CONDITIONED WAS NOT BECAUSE OF THE TWO NEED TO BE TIED TOGETHER. BUT BECAUSE OF THE TRAFFIC IMPACTS. THE UNKNOWN TRAFFIC IMPACTS.
01:05:01.448: >> THE PETITIONER WANT TO ADD ANYTHING IN ABOUT CUSTOMERS, LIKE HOW THEY ARE -- HOW THEY INTERPRET THAT?
01:05:08.121: >> IF ANYONE WANTS ON MY TEAM WANTS TO AT ANYTHING. BUT I WILL JUST SAY THAT CANNABIS CAN BE A SOCIAL AND KIND OF A COMMUNAL EXPERIENCE. THERE IS THAT REALITY. BUT MOST OF WHAT WE ARE REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT, YOU KNOW, ARE MOVED CUSTOMERS -- NEW CUSTOMERS WHO ARE BEING ACCOMPANIED BY A FRIEND OR A FAMILY MAP OR SOMEONE WHO IS GOING TO DRIVE THEM HOME. THERE'S JUST A LOT OF DIFFERENT TIMES WHERE WE ARE NOT ALONE. AND WE WANT TO BE SOMEONE -- WITH SOMEONE ELSE. ESPECIALLY SINCE CANNABIS CAN INSPIRE COMMUNICATE FEELINGS OF EMPATHY AND SOMETIMES SOCIALLY THAT DEEPEN FRIENDSHIPS. WE DON'T PLAN ON PEOPLE HANGING OUT ALL NIGHT OR ALL DAY THERE. BUT YES, WE DON'T WANT TO JUST HAVE SOLO INDIVIDUALS USING THE FACILITY.
01:06:02.742: >> THANK YOU. COMMISSIONER ABRONS?
01:06:06.880: >> THANK YOU. I WONDERED, JUST TO THE PERSON WHO CALLED IN WHO WAS TALKING ABOUT THE ODOR CONTROL SYSTEM, I ASSUME THAT IF IT WAS NOT WORKING, YOU WOULD CLOSE THE FACILITY AND NOT ALLOW PEOPLE TO CONSUME UNTIL IT WAS WORKING AGAIN? I WOULD OFFER AN OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU TO CONFIRM THAT.
01:06:30.570: >> WE -- PLEASE.
01:06:32.038: >> YEAH, ABSOLUTELY THAT WOULD BE THE CASE. ALSO, WE HAVE SOME FAILSAFES BUILT IN. YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO TELL IF THERE IS A FAIRLY EARLY ON. IF THERE WAS A FAILURE, WE WOULD CLOSE, OBVIOUSLY, YOU KNOW, WE KNOW THAT RULES AND WE DON'T WANT IT TO SPREAD OUTSIDE. WE DON'T WANT TO BOTHER THE NEIGHBORS. IN ADDITION TO THE SYSTEM WE ARE USING THAT UTILIZING TECHNOLOGY RECOUPED WE NOTE WHERE IT HAS TO BE REPLENISHED. WHAT WE ARE USING TO TAKE CARE OF THAT SMOKE AND WE WILL NO IN 60 DAYS. WE FEEL LIKE WE CAN BE AHEAD OF IT AT THAT POINT. BUT YES, IF THERE IS A FAILURE, WHICH WILL BE MARJORIE GREENE, WE WILL CLOSE DOWN ABSOLUTELY.
01:07:13.413: >> ANOTHER QUESTION ABOUT THE 45 MINUTES. I THINK THE LANGUAGE IN THE SEGMENTATION THAT WE RECEIVED SAID THAT VISITS ARE EXPECTED TO BE 45 MINUTES. IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE LIMITING RESERVATION SLOTS TO THE 45 MINUTES? IS THAT TRUE? IS THERE A HARD STOP AT 45 MINUTES?
01:07:30.530: >> YES, THAT IS THE -- WHENOU MAKE A RESERVATION AT THE CONSUMPTIO FACILITY, YOU ARE RESEING A 4 AND IT BLOCKED.
01:07:40.106: >> AND THEN YOU HAVE TOXIT? YOU MUST LEAVE.
01:07:43.243: >> YES.
01:07:43.743: >> OKAY. OKAY. THANKS.
01:07:48.948: >> AND HAVE COVID PROTOCOLS. THAT IS WHERE WE ARE AT RIGHT NOW. AND THAT IS WHY WE STRUCTURED IT THAT WAY.
01:07:59.826: >> OKAY.
01:08:00.093: >> AS FAR AS WHETHER OR NOT WE WOULD CLOSE, I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO THE STATE THAT LIST IN 2021 AMERICA OWNING CANNABIS BUSINESS IS NOT A RIGHT. IT IS A PRIVILEGE. AND YOU KNOW, IF WE HAVE TO COME AND, YOU KNOW, GET OUR LICENSE RENEWED ON A RICHLER BASIS AND BE STAND IN FRONT OF THE COMMUNITY AND IF WE DON'T HOLD TRUTH, IF WE DON'T DO RIGHT BY OUR NEIGHBORS, THEN OUR NEIGHBORS COME OUT AND TELL US. I WANT -- WE ALL WANT TO CREATE FACILITIES THAT WE ARE COMFORTABLE LIVING NEXT TO. THAT WE ARE PROUD OF SHOWING OUR KIDS AND TELLING OUR KIDS ABOUT AND THAT IS CRITICAL TO US. PAR SO JUST ADD THAT.
01:08:43.236: >> OF THE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS? COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT AND THEN COMMISSIONER LEE. NO, NEVERMIND, I WAS IMAGINING THAT.
01:08:55.748: >> JUST SORT OF DIRECTLY RELATED TO THAT WHAT YOU WERE JUST SITTING. I WANTED TO SEE IF YOU HAD ANYTHING ELSE THAT YOU WANTED TO THAT RESPOND TO THE COLOR. IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE MAY BE WERE SOME NOISE CONCERNS OR CONCERNS ABOUT PEOPLE CONGREGATING IN THE BACK, IF THAT WAS THE ENTRANCE. IF YOU HAVE ANY OTHER --
01:09:11.798: >> JUST -- YEAH. SO THE.
01:09:12.999: >> Cal108 MENTIONED THE ADDITIOL TRAFFIC -- THE CALLER MENTIONED THE ADDITIONAL TRAFFIC. WE REALLY DID NOT FIND IT SAFE. TO HAVE -- COULD NOT FILL THE SPACE WITH CUSTOMERS. SO WE HAVE LIMITED ALL TRAFFIC. AND BECAUSE OF THAT IT CREATED MORE CURBSIDE AND THUS MORE TRAFFIC. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ALL CONSUMPTION USED TRAFFIC WILL BE IN THE FRONT OF THE BUILDING AND NOT IN THE BACK. SO THE CALLER -- THIS WILL NOT CONTRIBUTE TO OR PEOPLE CONGREGATING BACK THERE. IT IS ONLY FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY USING THE FACILITY AND THE STAGGERED RESERVATION CHUNKS. THAT WAS IT.
01:10:05.151: >> THANK YOU. GO AHEAD.
01:10:08.254: >> I WAS GOING TO ADD REGARDING REGARDING THE NOISE ISSUE, ALL OF THE WORK THAT WE ARE DOING REPETITIVE AND SLEET THE BUSINESS WILL ELIMINATE -- INSULATE THE BUSINESS WILL ELIMINATE NOISE. WE TAKE CONSIDERATION OF HOW WE WILL INTERACT WITH OUR NEIGHBORS AND THAT WE ARE NOT BOTHERING THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
01:10:30.577: >> THANKS. I MENTIONED, POST-COVID, IF THAT IS EVER A THING, THAT ONE BE THE SAME ISSUE. THANK YOU.
01:10:40.219: >> IT WILL BE A THING. (CHUCKLES)
01:10:45.825: >> COMMISSIONER LEE?
01:10:48.027: >> YEAH, SURE. THANK YOU. AND THESE QUESTIONS MAY BE -- BEAR WITH ME. I'M TRYING TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THAT SCENARIO. THIS ONE IS FOR STAFF. SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE RUN WITH THE PARTICULAR PROPERTY? UNDER JUST THE LEASE WAS FOR TWO YEARS WITH THREE TWO-YEAR OPTIONS. THE OWNERSHIP AND THAT TENANTS SEEM TO BE TWO SEPARATE ENT ENTITIES. I WONDER IF THIS RUNS INTO THE PROPERTY. INSPECTION ALT SPECIAL EXCEPTION USES DO RUN WITH THE LAND. THE PLANNING COMMISSION'S FINDING THAT THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THIS ADDRESS ARE SUITABLE FOR THIS LAND USE REGARDLESS OF OWNER. SO THEY WOULD RUN WITH THE LAND. I WOULD ANTICIPATE YOUR QUESTION MIGHT BE IN LIGHT OF THE CONDITIONS. SO IN EIGHT YEARS' TIME TO GET THEY CAN WITH THEIR LEASE OR AS THEY WILL. I BELIEVE THAT SPECIAL EXCEPTION USES CAN BE VACANT FOR TWO YEARS. BUT AFTER TWO YEARS, THAN THEY ARE DEEMED TO HAVE LAPSED AND IT IS OVER. BUT IT DOES RUN WITH THE LAND BUT NOT WITH A PARTICULAR -- AND LAND USE, NOT A PARTICULAR OWNER. IN LIGHT OF THIS CONDITION, AGAIN, IT IS NOT TRIED TO THE OWNER OF THE ADJACENT BUSINESS EITHER. BUT IF THE EDGE AGENT -- ADJACENT PROVISIONING CENTER OR RETAIL AT WORK TO SEES THEN THIS CONSUMPTION FACILITY WOULD HAVE TO EITHER FIND ANOTHER OPERATOR FOR THE RETAILER. OR WE WOULD HAVE TO SORT OF GO BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD. BUT IT IS SORT OF A RISK THAT ALL SPECIAL EXCEPTION USES TAKE. THERE ARE PROVISIONS AND PROCEDURES, I SHOULD SAY COULD NOT PROVISIONS, PROCEDURES FOR AMENDING SPECIAL EXCEPTION USES. POSSIBLY BY THAT TIME, THERE WILL BE SOME DATA ABOUT TRAFFIC IMPACTS AND WE CAN REEVALUATE. BUT THAT IS A LOT OF WHAT-IFS AND A LOT OF ASSUMPTIONS. BUT JUST TO THE QUESTION AT HAND.
01:13:06.966: >> GOT IT. THANK YOU FOR THAT CLARIF CLARIFICATION. BEAR WITH ME. IS THE LANDLORD ENTITY AT AN ART'S LENGTH TRANSACTION? IS IT A RELATED ENTITY?
01:13:23.916: >> WE HAVE -- OKAY, GOT IT. THIS ONE IS FOR STAFF. OVERALL, ON A SPECIAL EXCEPTION YOU SPACE FOR CONSUMPTION CENTERS, HAVE SOME GUIDELINES FOR HOW MANY OF THESE WILL BE ALLOWED SPECIFIC ZONES? I THINK THEY SAID THIS OF THE FIRST ONE. I'M SPEAKING FROM AN OF JUST TRYING TO LEARN A LITTLE MORE ABOUT THIS. IS THERE KIND OF A MAXIMUM CAP DENSITY --
01:13:50.476: >> YEAH, IN -- IN THIS REGARD, YOU ARE NOT ALONE, ACTUALLY. I KNEW THAT THIS WAS THE FIRST IN ANN ARBOR. AND WE ARE GOING TO ALLOW 28. MENTIONED THE SAME 28 PROVISIONING. WE WILL GIVE OUT 28 LICENSES MATCHING THE NUMBER OF PROVISIONING CENTER RETAILERS. THIS IS THE FIRST. AND IT HAS BEEN A FEW YEARS THAT WE ALLOW THIS LAND USE OR ENABLED, I SHOULD SAY. THIS LAND USE. AND THIS IS OUR FIRST TAKER. IT DOES NOT SEEM TO BE A POPULAR -- IT IS NOT AS POPULAR AS THE RETAILER PROVISIONING CENTERS. AND I WAS ACTUALLY NOT AWARE THAT THIS IS THE FIRST INTERSTATE. BUT YOU ARE NOT ALONE PRACTICE OF THE FIRST IN THE CITY. AND WE HAVE OPENED UP THE POSSIBILITY FOR UP TO 28.
01:14:41.494: >> OKAY. GOT IT. THANK YOU FOR THAT CLARIFICATION. THIS ONE IS TOWARDS THE PETITIONERS. OBVIOUSLY, THIS BODY HAS BEEN VERY EMPHASIZING ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY. SO WHAT EFFORTS ARE YOU TAKING THAT PARTICULAR REALM AND WILL BE INSULATION THAT YOU GUYS ARE PUTTING IN FOR ODOR CONTROL, IMPROVED THE R VALUE AND THE INSULATED FACTOR AND IS YOUR CONTROL SYSTEM ACTUALLY GOING TO USE MORE ENERGY THAN, LIKE, A TRADITIONAL HVAC WITH THE FILTER TYPE, I GUESS, UNIT. SO CAN YOU JUST EXPOUND ON WHAT THAT THERE ARE THOUGHTS HERE AS TO IMPROVING THE ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY GOALS. AS YOU GUYS PROCEED HERE. I THINK I CAN ANSWER QUESTION. THE INSULATION THAT WE ARE USING COULD EXCEED ANY OF THE MACHINE -- REQUIREMENTS THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW. WE ARE LOOKING AT USING CLOSE SALES WITH THE SPACE. THE UNDERSIDE OF THE ROOF. CREATING AN IMPERMEABLE -- SO NO LEAKAGES COMING OUT. BUT TWO, AT A RATE OF ROUGHLY ABOUT PER INCH. COULD BE EXCEEDING THE R30 WITH THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS OR EXCEED THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS. THE WALLS WERE GOING TO BE USING SPRAY FOAM. WITHIN THE WALL STRUCTURE. WE COULD BE LOOKING AT AN R28. THAT IS REQUIRED FOR AN EXTERIOR WALL. AND ALSO, WE ARE GOING TO BE USING WHAT WE HAVE LISTED IN OUR PROTOCOLS FOR A SEALED BARRIER. AND WHAT THAT WILL DO IT WILL SEAL ANY CRACKS AROUND WINDOWS, DOORS, AND WALLS AND FLOORS. AND CASE STUDIES THAT, YOU KNOW, THAT MANUFACTURER HAS POSTED. REDUCES IT BY 70%. PREP JUST ALONE THERE. WE ARE GOING TO BE EXCEEDING ANY OF THE ENERGY STANDARDS WHICH IN TURN WILL REDUCE OUR COSTS AND WILL HELP WITH THE OVERALL ENERGY CONSUMPTION OF THAT BUILDING. AND THOSE SYSTEMS MEET ENERGY -- AND DATE MEET NEEDS. THEY MEET -- BUILDING, EVERYTHING. AND THEN I'M TRYING TO THINK WHAT ELSE. IT IS A PLETHORA OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE ALL ABOUT -- OR EXCEED THE STANDARDS.
01:17:20.753: >> OKAY. I APPRECIATE IT. WHEN I SEE THE TWO FILTRATION SYSTEMS, THE AMOUNT OF AIR THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE IT IS INCREASE. IT IS THE EFFORTS. I WONDERED HOW IT BALANCES OUT. ARE THERE OTHER KIND OF ELEMENTS WHETHER IT IS ELECTRIFICATION. AGAIN, IMAGINE THIS BEING A SLIGHTLY OLDER PROPERTY THAT YOU GUYS MAY HAVE. SLIGHTLY OLDER UNIT, SUPPOSE. BUT AS FAR AS INSULATION, I THINK THAT MAKES SENSE. ARE THERE ANY EFFORTS THAT YOU'RE GOING WITH THAT RESPECT?
01:17:58.958: >> TYPICALLY ON ANY NEW TYPES OF PROJECTS, LYNN B GET INTO THE CONTROLS FOR 90.1, THAT ARE REQUIRED, AND ALSO MAKING SURE THAT ALL OF OUR LAMPS ARE BEING EXPELLED AS LEDS. SO THAT WE ARE, YOU KNOW, AGAIN, CONSUMING THE LEAST AMOUNT OF ELECTRICITY THAT IS POSSIBLE ON THE PROJECT.
01:18:18.110: >> OKAY. PERFECT. YEAH, OCCUPANCY SENSOR IS GREAT. I'M GLAD YOU ARE MEETING ALL OF THE NECESSARY REQUIREMENTS. LAST ONE IS I'M GOING TO GO BACK. I KNOW OTHER COMMISSIONERS HAVE ASKED ABOUT THIS. BUT I WOULD LIKE FOR YOU JUST TO DIRECTLY RESPOND TO THE PUBLIC COMMENT COLOR THAT SAID THAT IT USED TO BE VERY QUIET. NOW IT IS TOO LOUD. YOU CAN'T SIT ON THE PORCH. IS THIS ABOUT MAKING MORE MONEY? SO COULD YOU GIVE US A VERY DIRECT RESPONSE TO THOSE PUBLIC COMMENTS? PLEASE.
01:18:52.378: >> ABSOLUTELY. WE HAVE JUST BEEN TRYING TO STAY AFLOAT DURING COVID. OR FROM A MONEY GRAB. IT IS THE CONTINUED SERVICE TO OUR PATIENTS. YOU KNOW, THERE'S A TEN DOLLARS FEE FOR ENTRY FOR THOSE WHO ARE ACCOMPANIED FOLKS. IT IS BELIEVED NOT A LOT OF MONEY THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE MAKING HERE. IT IS AN ADDITIONAL SERVICE. AGAIN, THE REASON FOR THE ADDITIONAL TRAFFIC THAT THAT CALLER HAS SEEN AS A SYMPTOM OF THE SAFETY CAUTIONS THAT WE TOOK TO PROTECT OUR STAFF AND OUR CUSTOMERS FROM SPREADING COVID. AND YEAH, I'M SAD TO HEAR THAT IT HAD ANY IMPACT ON IN A IT. I WISH I WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT AND EARLIER. BUT INDEED, IT IS A COVID REALITY THAT WILL END. WHEN COVID ENDS AND RE SO, THIS SPECIFIC ENTITY AND I THE CONSUMPTION FACILITY WILL HAVE NO IMPACT ON THAT BECAUSE, AG AGAIN, ALL TRAFFIC FOR THIS PART OF THE FACILITY WILL BE COMING FROM THE FRONT OF THE BUILDING. SO AGAIN, RESERVATIONS ONLY. AND THE CALLER'S BELIEF THAT THERE ARE MANY PLACES TO THAT LEGALLY USE CANNABIS, THERE IS ONE PLACE YOU CAN LEGALLY USE CANNABIS. YOUR HOME. PROPER AND THAT THAT IS ONLY IF THE TERMS OF YOUR HOME OWNERSHIP ALLOW. FOR A FRIEND PROFITS HELP OR WHOEVER'S HOME YOU ARE IN. YOU CAN'T USE THIS YOU CAN'T JUST GO INTO A PUBLIC BUILDING OR A HOTEL OR -- CAN'T. IT IS NOT THE CASE. THERE ARE ACTUALLY -- PEOPLE MIGHT USE CANNABIS WHEREVER THEY WANT TO. BUT THAT IS ACTUALLY NOT SOMETHING THAT WE ENCOURAGE. AS PART OF OUR GOOD NEIGHBOR POLICY.
01:20:47.459: >> JUST TO ADD A LITTLEBIT, WE ARE DOWNTOWN. WE ARE -- THERE COULD BE OTHER SIMPLY USES THERE. AND HELPING ON MIDNIGHT FROM 2:00 A.M. BUT WE ARE NOT ONE OF THOSE. WE ARE NOT DOING THAT. WE TALKS TO YOU KNOW, A LETTER OF SUPPORT FROM OUR IMMEDIATELY ADJACENT NEIGHBOR. WE APPROACHED OUR OTHER NEIGHBORS. WE ARE TRYING TO HAVE A DIALOGUE. I TRY TO TALK TO THE CALLER IN THE PAST AS WELL. WE ARE DOING OUR BEST TO INCORPORATE ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING WE HEAR FROM NEIGHBORS THAT IT MAKE SURE THAT WE DO NOT CAUSE ANY ISSUES FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD AND, YOU KNOW, GENERALLY WE HAVE GOTTEN REALLY GOOD EXP RESPONSES.
01:21:33.839: >> THE CALLER WHO CALLED DURING OUR COMMUTING MEETING THIS COMEDIC MEETING, I HOPE THAT THE SOPHISTICATED AND, YOU KNOW, COMPLEX NATURE OF OUR SOLUTION WHICH WE REALLY BELIEVE IS A SOLUTION TO IT THE OLDER. IS ASSIGNED TO HIM, THAT WE ARE COMMITTED TO GETTING IT RIGHT AND TO FIXING ISSUES THAT COME UP AND SAID THAT JUST BEING GOOD NEIGHBORS. SO WE WILL NOT COMMUNICATE STOP WITH WHATEVER. WE COULD NOT HAVE IMAGINED COVID. WHENEVER -- WHATEVER WE CAN MATCH UP NEXT, WE WILL MAKE SURE TO BE GOOD NEIGHBORS THEN, TOO. AND TO CONTINUE THAT CONVERSATION. PAR.
01:22:17.616: >> PERFECT. THAT IS THE REST, ALL OF MY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU.
01:22:22.988: >> THANK YOU.
01:22:23.355: >> COMMISSIONER RANDALL. THIS IS NOT ANY THINK THAT WE CAN MAKE YOU DO. BUT -- AND I AM IMPRESSED WITH A LOT OF THE WAYS THAT YOU ALL HAVE DISTINCT UP AND HAVE BEEN TRYING TO THINK AHEAD AND ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WE ARE TRYING TO THINK AHEAD AS THE COMMUNITY IS BY MEETING OUR CARBON NEUTRALITY GOAL IN 2030. THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY IS ACTUALLY -- HAS QUITE A BLACK EYE WITH THEIR ENERGY CONSUMPTION. AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF FACILITIES -- IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT FACILITIES. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU NECESSARILY HAVE A GROWTH FACILITY IN ANN ARBOR. BUT THERE ARE SOME PRETTY DIRE STATISTICS ABOUT THE INDUSTRY AND THE GROWING. AND I THINK IT WOULD BE A REALLY POSITIVE AND A REAL LEADERSHIP POSITION TO TAKE WITHIN YOUR INDUSTRY TO PUT SOLAR ON THESE TWO SOUTH FACING ROOF THAT YOU HAVE. NOT ONLY WOULD ALSO LOWER YOUR ENERGY BILLS INTO ALL KINDS OF OTHER GOOD THINGS FOR YOU, TOO. AND AGAIN, IT DOES NOT SOMETHING WE CAN MAKE YOU DO. BUT IT FEELS LIKE TO BE, THAT YOU ARE REALLY TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS. ABBY LUTZ THAT YOU ARE -- IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE RENTING. YOU DON'T OWN THE BUILDING. IT IS UNCLEAR TO ME. I THINK SOMEBODY MENTIONED THE LEASE. BUT THIS IS A PLACE WHERE, YOU KNOW, SOMEBODY TAKING A LEAD ON THIS, I THINK THAT WOULD BE A REALLY POSITIVE THING FOR YOU ALL WITHIN THE INDUSTRY AND ALSO JUST AS NEIGHBORS IN ANN ARBOR AND ONCE THAT YOU ARE WELL SET UP WITH THE SOUTH FACING ROOF WITHOUT ANY -- TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT. AND SO I AM GOING TO PUT A LITTLE PRESSURE AT A LITTLE PLUG OUT THERE FOR A ALL TO SEE IF YOU WOULD CONSIDER RISING TO THE OCCASION. I KNOW THAT IS NOT A SMALL THING TO DO. I PUT IT ON MY HOUSE. BUT IT IS ALSO SOMETHING FOR ME THAT WILL BE BACK IN TEN YEARS. I REALIZED THAT MAY BE BEYOND YOUR POLICE. BUT FROM THE LOOKS OF WHAT HOW THINGS ARE GOING IN ANN ARBOR WITH OUR CANNABIS INDUSTRY HERE IT SEEMS VERY ROBUST AND IT FEELS LIKE IT IS GOING TO STICK AROUND FOR A WHILE. SO I'M GOING TO PUT YOU ON THE SPOT. AND I'M JUST GOING TO ASK IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU ALL WOULD CONSIDER? I SEE --
01:24:59.611: >> YEAH.
01:25:01.380: >> -- NODDING HER HEAD A LOT.
01:25:03.615: >> I DON'T KNOW THAT I WILL DIRECTLY TAKE ON THE QUESTION ABOUT THE SOLAR PANELS. MAYBE I WILL LET NATE TAKE THAT ON. ONE THING THAT I DO WANT TO MENTION IS THAT WE ARE AWARE OF THE BLACK EYE TT THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY HAS BUT ONE THING THAT WE HAVE DONE AS A COMPANY ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND ALL OF THE FACILITIES THAT WE OPERATE, INCLUDING THE ONES THAT WE HAVE OPENING LATER THIS YEAR. AS WELL AS SOME OTHER STATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. WE HAVE SWITCHED TO ALL L.E.D. LIGHTS FOR GROWING IN EVERY SINGLE ONE OF OUR FACILITIES. IT IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT WE CARE A LOT ABOUT AND OUR PASSION LIES WITH YOURS. SO JUST WANTED TO PUT THAT OUT THERE AND MENTIONED THAT AS ONE THING THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY DOING AND I WILL LET NATE SPEAK TO THE POSSIBILITY OF SOLAR PANELS.
01:25:55.567: >> AND I THINK IT IS -- BECAUSE THERE'S A SMALL SPACE. BUT, YOU KNOW, I THINK I WILL SPEAK WITH HAROLD A BIT AND TALK ABOUT IT IN VARIOUS OTHER PROJECTS. THAT WE HAVE HAD AND LOOK INTO THE VISIBILITY OF IT. BY NO MEANS IN BALTIMORE. I KNOW SOME OTHER BUILDINGS WE HAVE NOT HAD THE KIND OF LIKE THAT WE WOULD HAVE HERE SO THAT WE CAN DO IT. I THINK WE CAN TALK AND CREATE A SERIES AND LET YOU KNOW SHORTLY IF YOU THINK THAT MAKES SENSE. TALK TO LANDLORD. IT IS NOT THAT WE ARE AGAINST, WE ARE GOING TO INTO THAT FOR SURE.
01:26:33.672: >> I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE THAT AND I THINK THAT, AGAIN, JUST -- IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU ALL ARE DOING LOTS OF THINGS WITHIN THE INDUSTRY. AND I THINK OF THE LIGHTS ARE A PIECE OF THAT. THAT FEELS LIKE NIBBLING AROUND THE EDGES IN TERMS OF THE REAL ISSUE. AND IT IS SOMETHING THAT IT JUST FEELS LIKE IT WOULD BE A GREAT WAY TO SHOW YOUR OWN COMMUNITY AS WELL AS THIS COMMUNITY, WHAT IS KIND OF POSSIBLE TO DO AND WHAT FEELS LIKE A REALLY RIGHT OPPORTUNITY WITH JUST THE WAY THE ROOFS ARE SET UP AND THERE'S JUST -- IT IS KIND OF WAITING FOR IT TO HAPPEN. THERE'S NO TREES IN THE WAY. AND SO WE WOULD, I THINK I PROBABLY SPEAK FOR MORE THAN JUST ME THAT WE WOULD APPRECIATE YOU ALL CONSIDERING THAT SERIOUSLY. AND I THINK THE MORE SEE THIS AROUND THE CITY, THE MORE THE MORE IT HAPPENS, THE MORE IT HAPPENS, IT REALLY. AND THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE DOING IT AND I THINK FRANKLY MORE BUSINESS PEOPLE STEPPING UP AND DOING IT. IT IS AN INSPIRATION FOR OTHER BUSINESSES THAT MAY BE RELATED OR NOT. SO ANYWAY. I MADE MY PLUG.
01:27:49.348: >> I APPRECIATE IT. (OVERLAPPING SPEAKERS)
01:27:52.985: >> IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE WILL TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION. WHILE L.E.D. LIGHTS ARE JUST A FIRST STEP FOR US, IT WAS ALMOST 10 MILLION-DOLLAR --
01:28:04.896: >> I GET IT. YEP. I GET IT.
01:28:07.966: >> IF I COULD ADD, YOU KNOW, I HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH NATE ON THESE PROJECTS SINCE ABOUT 2015. SO WE HAVE HAD THIS DISCUSSION NUMEROUS TIMES REGARDING THE CYST IN THE BUILDING, IN EFFECT, THAT MADISON HEIGHTS FACILITY THAT WAS BOOK ABOUT, IT WAS ORIGINALLY DESIGNED TO HAVE SOLAR PANELS ON THAT WITH TO AT THE POINT WORK AND WE WOULD FOLLOW THE ROOF TYPE -- ROOFTOP UNITS TO FREE UP ROUGHLY 45,000 SQUARE FEET OF ROOF SURFACE.
01:28:38.697: >> AWESOME.
01:28:40.198: >> UNFORTUNATELY, COVID HIT JUST AS WE WERE GOING THROUGH OUR PLANNING AND EVERYTHING ELSE. AND CONSTRUCTION AND CONSTRUCTION DOLLARS ALL CHANGED AND IT WAS PUSHING THE.
01:28:50.475: >> ALMOST EIGHT TO NINE MONTHS. HOWEVER, IT DOES NOT MEAN THAT -- IT STILL NOT BE A POSSIBILITY. THESE HOMES ARE THEY DID BACK TO THE -- THE 20th CENTURY. ROOF STRUCTURES ARE TWO BY FOUR. WITH CHICKEN BOARDS TRICK THEY ARE NOT DESIGNED -- THE ADDITIONAL SOLAR PANELS OUT THERE. I DO NOTE SOLAR PANELS DO PRODUCE SNOW BLOW. THEY SLIDE OFF. I HAVE BEEN DOING SOLAR INSTALLATION AND DESIGN ON PROJECTS I RAN THE SOLAR -- PROJECT FOR MORE THAN 72,006. SO I HAVE, YOU KNOW, A 40KW SYSTEM IN FLORIDA. SO THIS IS ONE OF -- YOU ARE SPEAKING TO COMMUNICATE I PUSH THIS AS MUCH AS I CAN IF DOLLARS, YOU KNOW, MAKE SENSE. AND AS YOU KNOW, IT DOES NOT BUY BACK ANYMORE. THEY CAP IT.
01:29:52.037: >> THAT IS RIGHT.
01:29:53.605: >> BECAUSE THE BUILDING IS VACANT, THEY LOOK AT TWO YEARS WORK ONE YEAR OF USAGE.
01:30:00.145: >> RIGHT.
01:30:00.445: >> YOU PUT THREE PANELS ON YOUR ROOF. THOSE ARE THINGS THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION. WE HAVE HAD THOSE CONVERSATIONS SINCE DAY ONE.
01:30:11.022: >> I'M ASKING YOU TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION.
01:30:14.025: >> I WILL PUSH.
01:30:16.862: >> AND DUKE LOOK INTO THE IMPACT OF L.E.D. LIGHTING. -- DO LOOK INTO THE IMPACT OF L.E.D. LIGHTING.
01:30:25.070: >> WE ARE TRYING TO --
01:30:26.738: >> I AM WITH YOU. I REALLY AM.
01:30:29.508: >> YOU KNOW? I MEAN, SO -- YEAH.
01:30:32.878: >> I WILL JUST TACK ON HERE THAT, YOU KNOW, PARTICULARLY GIVEN YOUR HOURS OF OPERATION ARE LARGELY DRINK THE DAYTIME HOURS YOU ARE ACTUALLY MATCHING WELL THE TIMING AND SO THOSE PANELS, LIKE THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO SELL BACK BECAUSE YOU WILL USE IT DURING THE DAY. MAY, YOU KNOW, JUST -- THIS IS WHERE IT IS DIFFERENT FROM FACILITY TO FACILITY, AS I'M SURE YOUR TEAM KNOWS. WHILE I'M TALKING ABOUT ENERGY, I WANTED TO AGAIN GIVE KUDOS TO HER WHAT COMMISSIONER -- TO WHAT COMMISSIONER LEE WAS POINTING OUT ABOUT THE EFFORTS TO AIR SEAL, LIKE, THAT IS THE TECHNOLOGY THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT USING IN OUR 1920s HOUSE BECAUSE I THINK THAT THAT -- I THINK THAT IS GREAT. IT IS GOING TO SERVE BOTH PURPOSES, BOTH OLDER BARRIER AND HELP MAKE YOU LOOK AT WHAT IS I'M SURE A PRETTY LEAKY HOME, NOT SO LEAKY IN THE FUTURE. I THINK, YOU KNOW, IS IT EXCITING IT IS EXCITING FROM MY END. THE KIND OF YOUR CEILING THINGS ARE T SO VISIBLE AND NOT NEARLY AS YOU KNOW, FLESHY OR TO PEOPLE. I THINK THAT THAT IS ACTUALLY ONE OF OUR BIGGEST BRIERS TO THE BEING ABLE TO OUR SUSTAINABILITY GOALS. HOW- RETFIT EVEXISTING ILDING STOCK AND ME YOU KNOW, BUILD THOSE LINKS. SO IT WAS EXCITING TO SEE THAT THAT WAS BEING DEPLOYED HERE. JUST EXCELLENT FINDING. MY SENSE, I AM IN THIS AREA QUITE A BIT. AND I ACTUALLY -- IT MAKES A LITTLE BIT MORE SINCE NOW. I WAS THINKING, I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYBODY HANGING OUT OR LIKE LOITERING OR, LIKE, NO LINE AT THE DOOR. AND SO, THAT IS MY PERCEPTION, NOT AS AN IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOR, BUT AS A FREQUENTER OF THIS PARTICULAR BLOG. THE QUESTION THAT I THINK YOU BROUGHT UP TO US WAS ABOUT SQUARE FOOTAGE. AND THE ABILITY OR THE REQUEST THAT THE ABILITY TO, YOU KNOW, NOT HAMPER YOURSELF TO FUTURE ENCLOSURE OF THE PORCH. THE QUESTION THAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT, AT THE PORCH A MINUTE. THE QUESTION, AT FIRST, THERE'S NOTHING. SOMETIMES FOR RETAIL FACILITIES, WE DO LIMIT THE SQUARE FOOTAGE. BUT THAT IS NOT PART OF THIS. IS THAT RIGHT?
01:33:19.678: >> CORRECT. I DID NOT PROPOSED IT SQUARE FOOTAGE LIMITATION. YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY. IF THE COMMISSION FEELS DIFFERENTLY, ONE CAN BE ADDED. THE COUPE IS CURRENTLY NOT ONE IN THE PROPOSED MOTION.
01:33:31.790: >> THERE IS A LIMITATION FOR THE RETAIL FACILITY THAT WE ARE TYING THIS TO, THOUGH. IS THAT RIGHT? OR MAYBE --
01:33:40.031: >> I CAN'T REMEMBER EITHER WAY. I WILL LOOK IT UP.
01:33:44.069: >> I THINK, YOU KNOW, I OFTEN THINK ABOUT, WHAT COULD HAPPEN IN REDEVELOPMENT? IT WOULD NOT NECESSARILY -- AGAIN, BECAUSE THAT GOES WITH THE PROPERTY. HOW WOULD THAT ACTUALLY WORK, IF THERE WAS A PHYSICAL CHANGE TO THE SITE SPECIAL EXCEPTION IS CONTINUES ON EVEN IF THE BUILDING BUT WE DEVELOP AND THEY COULD REESTABLISH THEMSELVES IN THREE YEARS?
01:34:07.492: >> WELL, GIVE ME A SECOND. TOO MANY QUESTIONS. COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN, GO AHEAD.
01:34:15.500: >> I THINK THIS IS THE HISTORIC DISTRICT. IS THAT CORRECT?
01:34:21.439: >> I DON'T THINK SO. ALL GOOD QUESTIONS.
01:34:28.580: >> I AM SEEING SHAKING THEIR HEADS. YOU WOULD KNOW, PROBABLY. ALSO, I WOULD IMAGINE THAT THAT IMPACTS IF YOU HAVE PLANS FOR THE FRONT PORCH. SO -- I WAS THINKING ABOUT THAT, TOO, THOUGH. I WAS LIKE, I'M NOT TOTALLY SURE. I WAS LOOKING AT THE BEST. I ASSUMED THAT.
01:34:52.303: >> I THINK THAT THAT -- YEAH, I WILL WAIT.
01:35:03.481: >> ALL RIGHT. THIS COULD BE A LITTLE BIT EASIER.
01:35:23.635: >> I CAN ADDRESS THE COUPLE OF THOSE. IT IS NOT IN THE HISTORIC DISTRICT. THE HISTORIC DISTRICT STOPS JUST A COUPLE OF BUILDINGS SOUTH OF LIBERTY THAT SIDE OF THE BLOCK. SO THE MAJORITY OF THAT BLOCK IS NOT IN THE HISTORIC DISTRICT. AS FOR HOW A RUBRIC -- REDEVELOPMENT WOULD WORK TO IT IS A GOOD QUESTION. TECHNICALLY, THE USE WOULD BE -- THE USE COULD BE AT REST OF THAT TWO-YEAR WINDOW IF FOR SOME RECENT THE WHOLE THING WAS TO BE WE DEVELOPED. NONETHELESS, THAT TYPE OF SCALE OF WE DEVELOPMENT WOULD MOST LIKELY REQUIRE A SITE PLAN. IT PROBABLY -- IF THERE WAS CONCERNED THAT IT WAS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN WITHIN A TWO-YEAR TIMEFRAME, WE WOULD PROBABLY JUST ADVISE SEEKING SORT OF REAPPLICATION OF THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE. TO THE SITE PLAN TO MAKE SURE THAT THE TIME WAS BUILT IN TO PROVIDE THAT. IF IT IS AN INTERESTING QUESTION. WE HAVE SORT OF A CORRELATED. IF THERE IS A RESTRICTION ON SIZE OR OCCUPANCY OR TRY TO'S SPECIAL EXCEPTION IS THAT YOU NEED TO AUTOMATICALLY MEANT THAT SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO EXPAND WITH THE SITE. SO THAT IS HOW I WOULD THINK IT WOULD HAPPEN THAT IT WOULD BE LARGELY PROBABLY TO THE PETITIONER. MICK THE DETERMINATION OF THEIR CONFIDENCE OF THAT OCCURRING WITHIN A TWO-YEAR WINDOW. PROPER ETIQUETTE WOULD BE -- IT WOULD STILL BE THE DISCRETION OF THE PLANNING COMMISSION TO DETERMINE THAT. BUT IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE, I JUST THINK IT PROBABLY WOULD BE A COMPELLING APPLICATION IN WHICH YOU HAVE A TRACK RECORD THAT YOU HAVE ESTABLISHED THERE. YOU HAVE SOME REAL APPLICATION DATA AND EXPERIENCE TO SEE HOW IT --
01:37:24.889: >> IF YOU ARE THINKING $700,000 INTO THE BUILDING, I CAN'T IMAGINE REDEVELOPING IT ANYTIME SOON. IF THIS IS WILDLY SUCCESSFUL, RIGHT, LIKE, I JUST CANNOT WOULD LIKE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THE IMPLICATIONS COULD BE. SO --
01:37:39.170: >> AND THEN I WILL LEAVE ANY SIZE PROVISIONS TO --
01:37:45.376: >> GREAT.
01:37:49.514: >> FOR APPROVED SPECIAL EXCEPTION USES, IT WHEN YOU A SITE PLAN. YOU ARE REQUIRED TO ALSO SEEK SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS. ENHANCE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE APPROVAL. IF IT IS A PLAN FOR THE CITY COUNCIL. AND THEN THE CODE OUTLINE THAN THE -- THEY WILL BASICALLY GO TOGETHER. IF THE SITE PLAN IS DENIED, THERE'S NO NEED FOR THE ADDITIONAL SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE. ALSO, IF THAT -- THAT USE COULD NOT BE PERMITTED. THE ORIGINAL SPECIAL EXCEPTION IS WITH STAN. BUT PHYSICALLY WITH AN EXPANDED SITE PLAN, IT WOULD TRIGGER THE REQUIREMENT TO ALSO SEEK AN EXPANDED SPECIAL EXCEPTION IS FOR THE ROLE. I THINK WHAT THEY WANT TO DO WITH THE FRONT PORCH, I'M THINKING THAT WOULD BE AN ADMINISTRATIVE AMENDMENT. THAT WOULD NOT TRIGGER A SPECIAL EXCEPTION IS.
01:38:53.711: >> OKAY. I WOULD JUST SAY, I CAN RECOGNIZE, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FLOW IS. THE FRONT PORCH REALLY MAKES THAT STREET. THE FRONT PORCH, I THINK HELP THAT STREET. AND SO PARTICULARLY IF THERE'S THINGS THAT, YOU KNOW, IT IS -- YOU ARE CAUGHT, ABOUT WHERE YOU DO THINGS AND IF THERE'S SPACE IN THE BACK OR NOT AND WHAT IMPACT THAT HAS ON NEIGHBORS, BUT, LIKE, IN THE STREAM OF, YOU KNOW, OF A FEW HOUSES THERE, MY SINS, I MEAN, THAT IS NOT WHAT IS BEFORE US. THAT IS MY TWO CENTS WORTH IS THAT, LIKE, THE CHARACTER OF HAVING FRONT PORCHES ALONG THE STRETCH IS KIND OF WHAT MAKES IT A FUN STRETCH OF -- A FUN BLOCK. SO --
01:39:50.034: >> IF I COULD REDUCE YOUR ANXIETY. WE ARE NOT GETTING RID OF THE ENTIRE PORCH. IT IS A PORTION OF THE PORCH CREATING AN ENTRY VESTIBULE. THERE WILL STILL BE A PROPER PORCH COVERED PORCH ON THE FRONT OF THIS BUILDING. SO IT IS NOT ENTIRELY GOING AWAY.
01:40:10.188: >> THERE'S THREE OR FOUR THAT ARE COMPLETELY ENCLOSED. THESE TWO HAVE ALWAYS BEEN OPEN. A BUNCH ON THE STREET THAT ARE FULLY ENCLOSED. WE ARE ONLY TRYING TO DO A PARTIAL ENCLOSURE.
01:40:22.734: >> GOT IT. YEAH. THERE ARE A COUPLE THAT ARE NOT SO NICE, I WOULD SAY.
01:40:36.714: >> THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL ENCLOSURE.
01:40:41.386: >> THE ARCHITECTURAL CHARACTER. AND DOING THE PANELS AND SO FORTH THINK IT ALWAYS HAS BEEN THERE. (LAUGHTER)
01:40:47.959: >> GREAT. AWESOME. I THINK -- I MEAN, I RECOGNIZE AMONG THE REASONS THAT IT WAS TIED TO THE NEIGHBORING, YOU KNOW, IT WAS IS WHAT -- THE NEIGHBORING RETAIL FACILITY. THAT IS WHAT YOU WERE PLANNING ANYWAY. IT HELPED EXPEDITE THE TRANSPORTATION OR THE TRAFFIC STUDY. I THINK THAT GIVES SOME ADDITIONAL -- HONESTLY, LIKE, THIS IS NEW. ANN ARBOR, FOR MICHIGAN. ETIQUETTE HELPS EASE INTO THIS. MY SENSE IS THAT THIS BUSINESS HAS BEEN AN ASSET TO THIS BLOCK. IT HAS BEEN IRRESPONSIBLE NEIGHBOR. AND SO I EXPECT THAT TO CONTINUE. AND I THINK IT DEFINITELY COULD HELP THE A MODEL FOR OTHERS -- BE A MODEL FOR OTHERS. I'M IN SUPPORT OF THIS.
01:41:40.812: >> OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMISSIONERS? I THINK THAT WE ARE READY FOR A VOTE, THEN. (ROLL BEING CALLED) THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
01:42:27.725: >> VERY GOOD. GOOD LUCK.
01:42:29.260: >> THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
01:42:31.095: >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME.
01:42:33.698: >> ALL RIGHT. BEFORE THE LAST THING THAT -- DO WE WANT A FIVE-MINUTE BREAK? WE WANT TO GO TO THE LAST ONE? THUMBS UP FOR A BREAK.
01:42:45.943: >> I JUST NEED TO GET WATER. I WILL TAKE TWO SECONDS.
01:42:50.581: >> I NEED TO GET WATER, TOO. LET'S MAKE IT FIVE. THAT WILL GIVE PEOPLE TIME TO STRETCH. WE WILL BE BACK HERE AT 8:52.
01:43:00.825: >> SOUNDS GOOD.
