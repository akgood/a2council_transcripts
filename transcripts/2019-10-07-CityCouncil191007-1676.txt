00:01:48.594: >> Councilmember Lumm: AND IF I COULD JUST EXPLAIN? AGAIN, C4 BEFORE B3 AND B4 AND THIS IS TO CHANGE THE AGENDA RELATED TO THE RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA ITEMS. C4 IS AN ORDINANCE TO TEMPORARILY OPT OUT UNTIL DECEMBER 16th AND GIVE THAN THE PURPOSE OF THE TEMPORARY OPT OUT IS FOR THE CITY TO TAKE MORE TIME TO REVIEW OUR PROCESSES, IT MAKES SENSE TO CONSIDER THAT ITEM PRIOR BEFORE TAKING A FINAL VOTE ON THE ORDINANCES THEMSELVES. FROM A SEQUENCE STANDPOINT THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING TO CONSIDER C4 FIRST.

WE HAD A VACANCY ON THE CENTER CITY TASK FORCE AND I ACTUALLY ASKED TO HAVE IT ON THE AGENDA, BUT WE HAVE KIND OF IDENTIFIED A REPLACEMENT AND SO I CAN -- I WILL SEND THAT AROUND TO THE CLERK ONCE WE GET IN HERE, IF I COULD. IT'S A SIMPLE RESOLUTION TO APPOINT A REPLACEMENT FOR MS. SYKES WHO RESIGNED.
00:03:16.648: >> Mayor Taylor: A NEW DC-5 ADDED. ALL IN FAVOR OF THE AGENDA AS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED? [CHORUS OF AYES]
00:03:27.159: >> Mayor Taylor: WAS THERE SOMETHING ELSE? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? THE AGENDA AS MODIFIED IS APPROVED DO WE HAVE COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR?

THANK YOU.
00:10:27.913: >> Mayor Taylor: THE FLOOR IS YOURS.
00:10:29.414: >> THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING. I AM LISA JACKSON, AS MAYOR TAYLOR SAID, I AM THE VICE CHAIR OF THE INDEPENDENT COMMUNITY POLICE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION. I AM JOINED TONIGHT BY SEVERAL OTHER COMMISSIONERS, ANI MIREI AND MOHAMMAD AHMED. BECAUSE WE ARE A NEWLY CREATED COMMISSION, IT'S IMPORTANT TO ARE US TO SPEAK PUBLICLY, DIRECTLY AND REGULARLY TO CITY COUNCIL AND TO THE COMMUNITY TO UPDATE YOU ON OUR PROGRESS. WE HAVE LEARNED IN OUR TRAINING THAT THAT IS A BEST PRACTICE NATIONALLY. AND THIS, OUR FIRST YEAR, THOUGH, OUR JOB AS WE INTERPRET IT IS TO LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR THE FUTURE. STARTING WITH SHARING OUR VISION AND GOALS AND BECOMING TRAINED TO BE COMPETENT. OUR PRIMARY VISION IS TO FOSTER A TRANSPARENT AND MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THOSE WHO LIVE AND WORK IN ANN ARBOR AND THE ANN ARBOR POLICE DEPARTMENT. WE UNDERSTAND THAT WHILE SOME DO HAVE FAITH, MANY SEGMENTS OF OUR COMMUNITY DON'T HAVE MUCH FAITH IN THE POLICE. WE KNOW THAT THE STEPS TO EARNING AND GROWING TRUST FACILITATE ENHANCED PUBLIC SAFETY FOR EVERYBODY. TRANSPARENCY IS AT THE HEART, THOUGH OF EARNING AND GROWING THAT TRUST. FIRST, THE PUBLIC NEEDS TO GET TO KNOW US. AND HERE OUR MOTIVATIONS TO SERVE ON THIS COMMISSION. COMMISSIONER DEANDRE CALDWELL SPEAR HEADS OUR OUTREACH AND HE HAS US GOING OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY TO HOLD LISTENING SESSIONS WHERE PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THEIR CONCERNS. WE HAVE MET AT LIBRARIES AND PEOPLE'S HOMES AND INELEVATORRED TO HOUSES OF WORSHIPS, AND NONPROFIT AGENCIES AND BASICALLY, WE WILL GO WHEREVER WE ARE INVITED. WE WELCOME INVITATIONS FROM ANY AND ALL COMMUNITY MEMBERS. WE WANT TO HEAR FEEDBACK. WE WANT TO GET CRITICISM AND WE WANT TO LEARN. WE ALSO WANT EVERYONE TO KNOW HOW TO FILE A COMPLAINT WITH US, BECAUSE THAT'S A NEW PROCESS. OUR GOAL IS FOR PEOPLE TO LEARN HOW DIVERSE WE ARE AS A COMMISSION IN OUR PERSPECTIVES AND IN OUR EXPERIENCES, AND YET HOW UNITED WE ARE BEHIND OUR MISSION. AND OUR MISSION, VERY QUICKLY IS TO ENCOURAGE THE ANN ARBOR POLICE DEPARTMENT'S RESPECTFUL TREATMENT OF ALL COMMUNITY MEMBERS, TO ENHANCE COMMUNICATION AND SHARING OF INFORMATION BETWEEN THE ANN ARBOR POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE COMMUNITY, TO PROMOTE POSITIVE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AND ESPECIALLY MEMBERS OF VULNERABLE, AT-RISK AND MARGINALIZED GROUPS WITHIN THE COMMUNITY. AND LAST, TO BUILD MUTUAL TRUST BETWEEN THE COMMUNITY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT. WE ALSO KNOW THAT EARNING AND GROWING THE TRUST OF THE COMMUNITY REQUIRES THAT WE BE COMPETENT. AND THAT INVOLVES TRAINING. WE OWE EVERY COMPLAINANT THE RESPECT OF AIR THOROUGH REVIEW AND THAT -- TO A THOROUGH REVIEW, AND THAT WE BE TRAINED AND ALONG WITH THE RIDE-ALONGS AND UNDERSTAND HOW THE POLICE DEPARTMENT GETS TRAINED IN USE OF FORCE. WE WERE ABLE TO ATTEND THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF CIVILIAN OF POLICE FORCES. IT WAS SO VALUABLE TO HELP US UNDERSTAND OUR WORK AND OUR GOAL IS TO HAVE FUNDING SUCH THAT ALL OF OUR COMMISSIONERS WITH ATTEND THIS CONFERENCE, BECAUSE IT'S THE LEADING AGENCY FOCUSING ON CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT. WE PARTICIPATED IN THREE LEARNING TRACKS, THE FIRST OF WHICH WAS THE TRAINING TRACK. IT TAUGHT PRINCIPLES AND COMPONENTS OF CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT, AND SKILLS NEEDED BY OVERSIGHT PROFESSIONALS. WE TALKED ABOUT THE ORIGINS OF CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT. WE DISCUSSED PUBLIC DEMANDS FOR CHANGE AFTER TRAGEDY, INCLUDING THE SHOOTING OF AURA ROSSER HERE IN ANN ARBOR, HOW TO USE STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS BIASED POLICING IN THE 21st CENTURY AND HOW TO ANALYZE VIDEO-DRIVEN INVESTIGATIONS. THE COMMUNITY TRUST TRACK REITERATED TO US THAT WHEN COMMUNITIES LOSE TRUST IN THE POLICE, THEY OFTEN DON'T REPORT CRIME. THEY HAVE DON'T COOPERATE WITH INVESTIGATIONS INTO CRIME AND THEY ARE OFTEN REMOVED FROM THE CONVERSATION ON POLICE EFFECTIVENESS. WE LEARNED HOW TO ENGAGE THE COMMUNITY TO HELP LAW ENFORCEMENT EARN AND GROW TRUST WITH THE COMMUNITIES THAT THEY SERVE, AND WE EXPECT TO BE A CONDUIT IN THAT PROCESS. THE COLLABORATION TRACK WAS -- IN TERMS OF OVERSIGHT PRACTITIONERS, TEACHING US HOW TO COLLABORATE WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS EFFECTIVELY, OBJECTIVELY, AND INDEPENDENTLY. IT STRESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF BUILDING EFFECTIVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT WHILE MAINTAINING OUR INDEPENDENCE, MAINTAINING THE PERCEPTION OF INDEPENDENCE, THROUGH GOOD COMMUNICATION, AND RECOGNIZING AND MITIGATING THREATS TO OVERSIGHT INDEPENDENCE. WE ARE CONTINUING TO USE NACOL FOR TRAINING MATERIALS SUCH AS WEBINARS AND WE ARE ALSO EXPLORING THEIR CREDENTIALING PROGRAM. THE CONFERENCE WAS ALSO BENEFICIAL TO US IN CONNECTING WITH US A NETWORK OF ALLIES AND CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT SUCH AS JUST JUDGEY LEAVE AND PROFESSOR BARBARA McQUAID AND WE CONNECTED WITH OTHER GROUPS IN MICHIGAN THROUGHOUT THE MIDWEST AND THE MICHIGAN DEPARTMENT OF CIVIL RIGHTS. ALL OF THESE INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS OFFERED THEMSELVES AS A RESOURCE TO US AND WE HAVE AND WE ARE CONTINUING TO FOLLOW UP WITH MEETINGS WITH EACH OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS. WE HAVE ALSO BEGUN EXPLORING OTHER LOCAL AND REGIONAL GROUPS, THAT FOCUS ON FACILITATING TRUST BETWEEN THE COMMUNITY AND THE POLICE FOR EXAMPLE. WE HAVE BEGUN COLLABORATING WITH THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION HERE IN ANN ARBOR. WE ALSO HAVE TRAININGS PLANS FROM MCOL, THE MICHIGAN COMMISSION ON LAW ENFORCEMENT STANDARDS AND CALEA, AND THE ACCREDITATION FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND WE EXPECT IT WILL GIVE US SOME INSIGHT AS TO HOW THEY SET THEIR STANDARDS AND HOW WE CAN CREATE A FORUM FOR THE COMMUNITY TO COMMUNICATE ITS EXPECTATIONS IN THAT PROCESS. WE ALSO KNOW THAT OUR ACTIONS AS A COMMISSION NEED TO BE TRANSPARENT. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THAT AS WELL. WE KNOW OUR PROCESSES NEED TO BE TRANSPARENT AND WE ARE WORKING TO FACILITATE THAT IN SEVERAL WAYS, INCLUDING BY HAVING A SIGNIFICANT PRESENCE ON THE WEBSITE, BUT WE INTEND TO ADD MORE CONTENT AND AS WE GO OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY WE PLAN TO BE MORE OPEN, MORE TRANSPARENT ABOUT OUR PROCESSES AND GETTING CRITICISM FROM COMMUNITY MEMBERS, WHICH IS ONLY GOING TO HELP US IMPROVE. WE ALSO KNOW THAT WE NEED TRANSPARENCY FROM THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE, WHICH TRANSLATES INTO ACCESS TO THEIR POLICIES AND PROCESSES. WE'RE OPTIMISTIC THAT CHIEF COX, A NEW AND YET AS NAMED DEPUTY CHIEF AND JASON FORSBERG WILL BE ABLE TO GAIN SOME GROUND IN GETTING THE TOOLS THAT WE NEED SUCH AS BODY CAM FOOTAGE, WITNESS STATEMENTS AND ORIGINAL COMPLAINANT REPORTS. WE HAVE BEGUN RIGOROUS TRAINING. THIS IS ONGOING. WE ARE INCREASING OUR OUTREACH. WE ARE WORKING TO EARN SUPPORT AND TRUST THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY. IT'S GOING TO TAKE MANY, MANY HOURS TO DEVELOP A ROBUST COMMUNITY POLICE OVERSIGHT GROUP AND WE WILL KEEP YOU UPDATED ON OUR PROGRESS, BECAUSE WE WANT YOU TO FEEL WHAT WE FEEL, WHICH IS THAT WE ARE ALL WORKING TOGETHER. WE LOOK FORWARD TO UPDATING YOU ON OUR CONTINUED PROGRESS IN A FEW MONTHS AND WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO CONTACT US WITH QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS. THANK YOU.
00:17:46.251: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [ APPLAUSE ] WE NOW COME TO PUBLIC COMMENT RESERVE TIME. PUBLIC COMMENT RESERVE TIME IS A TIME FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO SPEAK TO THE COUNCIL AND THE COMMUNITY ABOUT MATTERS OF MUNICIPAL INTEREST. ONE NEEDS TO HAVE SIGNED UP IN ADVANCE BY CONTACTING OUR CITY CLERK. SPEAKERS HAVE THREE MINUTES IN WHICH TO SPEAK. SO PLEASE PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE TIME CLOCK. AS A MATTER OF COURTESY, WE MAY HAVE ONLY ONE PERSON SPEAKING AT A TIME. AND FINALLY, IF YOU REQUIRE ASSISTANCE IN SPEAKING BEFORE COUNCIL TODAY, WE WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO PROVIDE IT TO YOU. OUR FIRST SPEAKER IS ADAM OXNER.
00:18:26.090: >> HELLO. I'M ADAM OXNER AND I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT DC-1, RESOLUTION DIRECTING THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR TO PULL UP SOME DATA FOR SAFETY AND CRASH DATA FOR THE VISION ZERO PROJECT. I'M IN GENERAL SUPPORT OF REGULAR REPORTS OF SAFETY AND CRASH DATA BECAUSE MORE INFORMATION IS BETTER. BUT I AM CONCERNED THAT THIS BRINGS ITS -- IT BRINGS THE DATA TO THE CITY COUNCIL UNNECESSARILY, AND MIGHT CAUSE UNNECESSARY OVERHEAD, WHICH COULD SLOW STAFF'S PROGRESS BECAUSE IT IS MY VIEW THAT CITY STAFF AND ENGINEERS ARE DOING A REALLY GOOD JOB AT -- AT LOOKING AT THE DATA THEMSELVES AND I'M SURE THEY HAVE THE DATA AVAILABLE, BUT PUTTING IT INTO REPORTS AND SENDING IT OUT TO COUNCIL REGULARLY, IT COULD BE BENEFICIAL, IF IT MOVES FORWARD. I WOULD LIKE TO KEEP -- HAVE COUNCIL KEEP AN EYE ON THE EFFICIENCY OF PROGRESS SO IT DOESN'T SLOW US DOWN. AND THEN THE -- I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE ABOUT, BUT THE SECOND RESOLVE STATEMENT IN DC-1 SEEMS LIKE IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT HEAVY HANDED, ASKING THE -- OR WORDED HEAVY HANDED, ASKING THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR TO PROVIDE REPORTS TO THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION AND SUCH. I -- MAYBE IT'S -- I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW IT WORKS EXACTLY, BUT IT SEEMS LIKE IT COULD HAVE POSSIBLY BEEN JUST A ONE-ON-ONE REQUEST INSTEAD OF HAVING A RESOLUTION BROUGHT TO COUNCIL. THAT'S IT. JUST A SHOUTOUT TO THE ENGINEERING STAFF. I THINK THEY ARE DOING A IF JOB AND THANK YOU.
00:20:09.660: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS ROBERT McGEE. ROBERT McGEE? OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS BLAINE COLEMAN.
00:20:33.050: >> THIS MAYOR HAS MADE IT CLEAR IN MLIVE THAT HE VIEWS THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE AS SUBHUMAN. IN MLIVE, IN 2018, WHEN ISRAEL WAS SHOOTING DOWN PALESTINIANS BY THE THOUSANDS, ONE OF US DEMANDED OF THE MAYOR TO SPEAK AGAINST THIS MASSIVE GUN VIOLENCE BY ISRAEL, AGAINST THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE. AND THE MAYOR SAID, UH, NO, WE TEND TO FOCUS ON MATTERS THAT IMPACT MEMBERS OF THE ANN ARBOR COMMUNITY. AS IF PALESTINIANS ARE NOT MEMBERS OF THE ANN ARBOR COMMUNITY. THEY ARE! PALESTINIANS ARE MEMBERS OF THE ANN ARBOR COMMUNITY. WE BROUGHT THIS UP REPEATEDLY. I HAVE YET TO HEAR THE MAYOR ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YES, PALESTINIANS ARE MEMBERS OF THE ANN ARBOR COMMUNITY AND IF SOMEONE WANTS TO BRING A RESOLUTION TO DEFEND THE RIGHTS OF PALESTINIANS TO THIS CITY COUNCIL, THEN BY GOD IT OUGHT TO BE HEARD BY THE CITY COUNCIL IN PUBLIC, LIKE ANY OTHER SERIOUS MATTER. I HAVE YET TO HEAR THE MAYOR SAY THAT. I HOPE THE REST OF THE CITY COUNCIL IS NOT TAGGING ALONG WITH THE MAYOR. I HOPE THE REST OF THE CITY COUNCIL DOES NOT ACT AS THOUGH PALESTINIANS WERE SUBHUMANS, NONMEMBERS OF THE ANN ARBOR COMMUNITY. PALESTINIANS ARE MEMBERS OF THE ANN ARBOR COMMUNITY. THOUTHOUSANDSOF PALESTINIANS LIE HERE AND EVEN IF THEY DIDN'T, EVEN IF NOT ONE PALESTINIAN LIVED HERE, OUR MONEY AND OUR POLITICAL SUPPORT SHOULD NOT BE GOING TO ISRAEL AS IT GUNS DOWN PALESTINIANS BY THE THOUSANDS. AND YOU SHOULD PASS THE RESOLUTION WHICH WE HAVE DEMANDED IN HERE, REPEATEDLY, THAT SAYS -- LOOK AT THE SIGN -- WE ARE AGAINST MILITARY AID TO ISRAEL. SEVEN LITTLE WORDS WON'T TAKE MUCH OF YOUR TIME. AND THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE ARE MEMBERS OF THE ANN ARBOR COMMUNITY, WHEN YOU, WITH YOUR TAX MONEY HELP ISRAEL GUN DOWN THOUSANDS OF PALESTINIANS AND IN THE GAZA STRIP. EVERY PALESTINIAN IN ANN ARBOR -- EVERY PALESTINIAN IN ANN ARBOR FEELS THOSE BULLETS THEMSELVES.
00:23:25.790: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS MOZHGAN SAVABIEASFAHANI.
00:23:30.528: >> NOT ONLY PALESTINIANS ARE MEMBERS OF THIS CITY, OF THIS COMMUNITY, THEY HAVE BEEN COMING TO CITY COUNCIL. THEY HAVE BEEN DEMANDING A CUTOFF OF MILITARY AID, BOYCOTT AND MANY, MANY THINGS FOR MANY, MANY YEARS. AND THIS MAYOR TAYLOR KNOWS IT BECAUSE HE USED TO BE A COUNCILMEMBER. ALL THOSE YEARS AGO, WHEN STUDENTS, PALESTINIANS, ARABS, MUSLIMS, FILLED THESE CHAMBERS, AND SHOUTED BOYCOTT ISRAEL. HE REMEMBERS THAT. YET, HE HAS NEVER, EVER, SAID A WORD ABOUT THE RIGHTS OF PALESTINIANS TO BE TREATED LIKE HUMAN BEINGS. HE HAS NEVER, EVER, SAID A WORD ABOUT THE MOST SIMPLE RIGHTS OF PALESTINIANS WHO LIVE IN THIS CITY. HE HAS TURNED HIS BACK ON ALL OF US WHO HAVE BEEN COMING AND DEMANDING BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS FOR OURSELVES. UNITED STATES IS A COLLABORATOR WITH THE RACIST STATE OF ISRAEL. THE UNITED STATES PROVIDES MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF POLITICAL AID, MILITARY AID TO THE RACIST STATE OF ISRAEL. WITH THOSE HELPS, ISRAEL IS ABLE TO SHOOT DOWN THOUSANDS OF PALESTINIANS EVERY DAY, EVERY WEEK THEY ARE SHOOTING PEOPLE. THEY ARE SENDING MANY OF THEM TO THEIR GRAVES. MOSTLY YOUNG CHILDREN, MOST LYEY TEENAGERSEN ATHE REST OF THEM END UP IN HOSPITALS WHERE THEY ARE MASSIVELY, MASSIVELY UNDEREQUIPPED AND MANY OF THEM, THOUSANDS OF PALESTINIANS END UP AMPUTATED LEGS AND ARMS. AND THIS IS DOING OF US. WE ARE DOING IT. THIS CITY COUNCIL, YOUR SILENCE IS HELPING THAT J GENOCIDAL GOVERNMENT OF ISRAEL TO CONTINUE THIS. IF WE DO NOTHING, THEY WILL CONTINUE TO DO IT. ON TOP OF, THE U.S. HAS COMMITTED 38 BILLION TO GO TO ISRAEL IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS. I AM SAYING, IF YOU HAVE NO HUMANITY IN YOU, TO STAND UP AND SAY NO MORE MILITARY AID TO ISRAEL, THINK ABOUT THE MONEY OUT OF YOUR POCKET, MR. MAYOR. THAT MANY CAN TAKE HERE, AND HELP HEALTH, EDUCATION, AND CHILDREN OF THE UNITED STATES WHO DESERVE IT. INSTEAD OF, WITH YOUR SILENCE, YOU ARE SENDING THOSE MILLIONS TO THE BUTCHERS IN ISRAEL WHO WILL TURN AROUND AND KILL CHILDREN AND DESTROY LIVES AND DESTROY THIS PLANET. THAT IS UNLESS YOU CHANGE YOUR HEART AND SAY NO MORE MILITARY AID TO ISRAEL.
00:26:32.743: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS JEFF CROCKETT.
00:26:43.621: >>> GOOD EVENING, MY NAME IS JEFF CROCKETT, . I'M HERE TO EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE WHO MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR FIRE WEEK DECLARATION THIS EVENING. ACCORDING TO STATISTICS PROVIDED BY CHIEF KENNEDY, ANN ARBOR FIRE DEPARTMENT HAS RESPONDED TO 113 STRUCTURAL FIRES SO FAR IN 2019, WITH TWO CIVILIAN INJURIES AND SIX FIREFIGHTER INJURIES ALONG WITH ONE CIVILIAN FATALITY. IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT EVERY FIRE PRESENTS A THREAT TO FIREFIGHTERS IN ADDITION TO RESIDENTS. AND SO AT THE OUTCOME OF FIRE SAFETY WEEK IS THAT EVEN ONE RESIDENT AND FIREFIGHTER ARE SAVED FROM INJURY, THIS EFFORT WILL BE WORTH IT. ON AUGUST 29th, MEMBERS OF THE OLD FOURTH WARD ASSOCIATION, CORD FACOORDINATED TO DELIVER WE PACKETS TO INCLUDE INFORMATION ABOUT FIRE SAFETY. THE INNER COOPERATIVE COUNCIL HAS ALSO JOINED US IN THIS EFFORT. WE BELIEVE IT WILL TAKE MORE THAN AN ANNUAL EFFORT TO MAXIMIZE FIRE SAFETY FOR THE RESIDENTS OF ANN ARBOR. RANGELY -- WELL, LINKS TO WEBSITES EMAILS EASILY GET LOST OVER TIME. THE OLD FOURTH WARD LOOKS FORWARD TO WORKING WITH CHIEF KENNEDY, AND 4th WARD BANNISTER AND COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER TO CONSIDER OLD WAYS TO OUTREACH, THE DEVELOPMENT OF FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS AND ANN ARBOR'S NOTIFICATION SYSTEM AND THE NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATION CONTACT LIST. IN ADDITION, I REALLY LOVE THIS PROCLAMATION, BECAUSE IT OUTLINES FIRE SAFETY PLANS BUT THERE ARE OTHER THINGS WE CAN DO. FOR EXAMPLE, WE PARTICIPATED IN THE RED CROSS PROGRAM WHERE WE GOT FREE SMOKE ALARMS. THE SMOKE ALARMS COME WITH TEN-YEAR BATTERIES. SO AS I UNDERSTAND IT, THE REQUIREMENT FOR THE FIRE DEPARTMENT IS TO REPLACE SMOKE ALARMS EVERY TEN YEARS. SO WHY NOT ASK LANDLORDS TO GET A TEN-YEAR BATTERY? BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS? WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU HAVE ONE-YEAR BATTERIES? THIS THEY EXPIRE AND FREQUENTLY WHAT HAPPENS -- I HAVE BEEN TOLD BY LANDLORDS -- SOME INDIVIDUALS WILL TAKE OUT THE BATTERY JUST TO STOP THE ALARM. I MEAN, THAT IS NOT GOOD. HOW CAN WE MAKE IT EASY FOR EVERYONE? GET TEN-YEAR LITHIUM BATTERIES LIKE THE FIRE SAFETY PROGRAM OF THE RED CROSS DOES. THE OTHER THING THAT SEEMS LIKE A NO-BRAINER IS FIRE EXTINGUISHERS. WE HAD A FIRE IN OUR HOUSE A YEAR AND A HALF AGO THAT I TOLD YOU ABOUT PREVIOUSLY O AND THE ONLY REASON WE WERE ABLE TO STOP THAT IS STUDENTS CAME OVER AND BORROWED MY FIRE EXTINGUISHER. I APPRECIATE ALL OF YOUR SUPPORT AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION.
00:29:48.572: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. ARE THERE COMMUNICATIONS TODAY FROM COUNCIL? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
00:29:53.377: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, MAYOR TAYLOR. A LOT OF TIMES, I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO SAY AT THESE MOMENTS, BUT I HAVE A LOT OF THINGS TO SAY. I HAVE TO KEEP IT DOWN TO A VIEW. I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THANKS TO THE MEMBERS ICPOC FOR SHOWING UP TONIGHT, THE POLICE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION TO GIVE US THAT GREAT UPDATE AS LIAISON TO THE COMMISSION WITH COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, IT'S GREAT TO SEE THAT. YOU PUT A LOT OF WORK AND TIME INTO IT. IT'S TAKEN MORE TIME THAN MOST COMMISSIONS, AND YOU KNOW, THERE'S UNCHARTERED WATER AND YOU HAVE TO GO OUT THIS AND LOOK FOR THE ANSWERS AND THEY ARE NOT THIS. SO IT'S -- WE'RE THRILLED TO KNOW THAT THE CONFERENCE IN DETROIT WAS A HUGE SUCCESS, AND WE'LL BUILD ON THAT. SO ALL FOR SHOWING UP TONIGHT AND ALL THE WORK YOU ARE PUTTING INTO IT. IT'S NOT GOING UNNOTICED. WE HAD A HUGE TURNOUT YESTERDAY AT THE U.S. GATE LIBRARY TO TALK ABOUT SHORT-TERM RENTALS. THIS WAS WELL OVER 100 PEOPLE IN ATTENDANCE FOR ABOUT TWO HOURS AND TALKED ABOUT THE PROS, THE CONS AND HOSTS, GUESTS, A WHOLE LIST OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE WHERE THERE TO REPRESENT THEMSELVES AND THEIR INTERESTS. WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE TWO OTHER MEETINGS THAT WILL BE OCCURRING LATER ON THIS WEEK SO WE CAN GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW TO FACILITATE THE SHORT-TERM RENTALS AND REGULATE THEM AND KNOW WHERE THEY EXIST AND HAVE THE CONVERSATION AROUND ALL THE INTANGIBLES. ALSO, I HATE TO END IT ON THIS NOTE, BUT THE COMMUNITY LOST A GIANT MARY HATHAWAY PASSED AWAY YESTERDAY, I THINK. REALLY SOMEBODY WHO HAS DONE A LOT IN THEIR LIFE, WHO LIVED A FULL LIFE, WHOSE LEGACY WILL CONTINUE. IT WAS AN HONOR TO WALK WITH HER AND KNOCK DOORS WITH HER AND MY THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS ARE WITH HER FAMILY AND FRIENDS AND I THINK ALL OF US UP HERE CAN LEARN SOMETHING FROM HER, BY THE WAY SHE CARRIED HERSELF AND THE CLASS AND DIGNITY SHE ENGAGED WITH PEOPLE, EVEN WHEN SHE HAD DIFFERENCES. SO YOU WOULDN'T KNOW IT BY THE TONE AND TENOR OF THE CONVERSATION. SO -- SO I WILL LEAVE IT ON THAT. THANK YOU.
00:32:34.271: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
00:32:36.440: >> Councilmember Eaton: THANK YOU. I WANT TO THANK OUR TRANSPORTATION STAFF FOR AGREEING TO MEET WITH COUNCILMEMBERS BANNISTER, GRISWOLD AND MYSELF ON SEPTEMBEE TRAFFIC RECONFIGURATION ON SOUTH DIVISION STREET. AT THE TIME OF THAT MEETING, WE -- THE TRANSPORTATION STAFF HAD NOT YET HEARD FROM OUR SAFETY STAFF, BUT IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT IN CONSULTATION WITH SAFETY STAFF, THAT AREA OF SOUTH DIVISION WILL BE REDESIGNED TO BETTER ACCOMMODATE EMERGENCY VEHICLES. I THINK THAT WE ALL UNDERSTAND THAT TRAFFIC CONFIGURATION IS NOT A SCIENCE BUT THERE ARE MINIMUM STANDARDS WHEN HE PAINT LINES ON THE ROAD TO ACCOMMODATE ALL MODES OF TRANSPORTATION. AND IN THIS CASE, WE JUST EXCLUDED THE NEED TO ACCOMMODATE EMERGENCY VEHICLES SUCH AS FIRE TRUCKS AND AMBULANCES. SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT REDESIGN BEING IMPLEMENTED TO BETTER ACCOMMODATE ALL OF THE KINDS OF VEHICLES THAT TRAVEL ON SOUTH DIVISION BETWEEN HILL AND PACKARD. SO THANKS SO MUCH TO STAFF.
00:33:52.583: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
00:33:53.483: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. THANK YOU FROM MYSELF AS WELL TO DR. JACKSON FOR THE OVERVIEW. I HAD THE DISTINCT PLEASURE OF GETTING TO SERVE ON THE INDEPENDENT POLICE OVERSITE COMMISSION FOR ONE DAY. IT'S AWESOME AND INCREDIBLE TO SEE THE PROGRESS THAT YOU -- EXCUSE ME, THAT YOU ALL HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE OVER THESE MONTHS AND IT'S REALLY A DELIGHT TO SEE. ON THE SAME NOTE, AND THE SPIRIT OF IMPROVING COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE PUBLIC AND THE POLICE DEPARTMENT, COUNCILMEMBER GRAND AND I WANT TO INVITE ANY CITY RESIDENTS BUT IN PARTICULAR RESIDENTS OF THE THIRD WARD TO MEET OUR NEW POLICE CHIEF, CHIEF COX IN TWO SEPARATE EVENTS. THE FIRST IS COMING UP QUICKLY ON THURSDAY, OCTOBER 10th, THAT'S THIS THURSDAY AT 7 P.M., AT PITTSFIELD ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. THE SECOND OPPORTUNITY IN THE THIRD WARD WILL BE ON TUESDAY, OCTOBER 22nd, AT THE BRYANT COMMUNITY CENTER, ALSO AT 7 P.M. WE LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING EVERYONE OUT THERE AND A SPECIAL THANKS TO CHIEF COX, HIS ASSISTANT KERRY, AS WELL AS ANGIE SMITH FROM THE FOREST BROOK NEIGHBORHOOD AND SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER, SUSAN BASKET FROM THE ARBOR OAKS NEIGHBORHOOD FOR CCOORDINATING DATES AND TIMES. THANKS.
00:35:17.334: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
00:35:19.503: >> Councilmember Grand: SPEAKING OF ICPOC AND I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU FOR YOUR HARD WORK. EVERY TIME I SEE THIS GROUP WORK TOGETHER, I FEEL SO GOOD ABOUT THE PROCESS THAT GOT YOU HERE AND NOW WE GET TO NOMINATE ONE MORE PERSON TO ICPOC AND I ALSO HAVE SOME OTHER POSITIONS THAT I WILL BE WORKING TO FILL IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS, MONTHISH, EITHER ON MY OWN OR WITH SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES. ANOTHER ONE IS TO THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION. SO WE HAVE A COUPLE OF POSITIONS THERE THAT WE ARE LOOKING THAT WE WILL BE LOOKING TO FILL. THE MAYOR MAKES THAT APPOINTMENT, BUT I WANT TO ENCOURAGE FOLKS TO APPLY, IF YOU ARE INTERESTED. I WILL ALSO BE NOMINATING AN AT-LARGE MEMBER AND A PERSON WHO HAS A BACKGROUND IN REAL ESTATE TO THE GREEN BELT ADVISORY COMMISSION. SO IF YOU HAVE A BACKGROUND IN REAL ESTATE, OR YOU JUST ARE INTERESTED IN LAND PRESERVATION, I ENCOURAGE YOU TO APPLY TO THAT COMMISSION AS WELL. WE'LL BE TRYING TO MOVE THOSE FORWARD SO WE CAN HAVE SMOOTH TRANSITIONS AND PLENTY OF PEOPLE PARTICIPATING IN THOSE COMMITTEES. I ALSO JUST WANTED TO GIVE A HEADS UP AND, OF COURSE, I ALMOST JUST LOST IT TO COUNCIL THAT I WILL BE COMING FORWARD EITHER AT THE NEXT MEETING OR THE FOLLOWING MEETING, I'M HOPING TO JUST BE PROACTIVE IN TERMS OF THE EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT WAS RELEASED ON SEPTEMBER 26th FROM THE WHITE HOUSE THIS WILL BE REQUIRING OFFICIAL CONSENT FROM STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FOR REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT. I THINK WE AS A COMMUNITY CAN GET OUT IN FRONT OF THAT, AND GIVE OUR CONSENT AND ENCOURAGE OUR STATE LEADERS TO D DO THE SAME. I DON'T THINK THAT WILL BE I ALONG CONVERSATION -- A LONG CONVERSATION BUT IF ANY OF MY COLLEAGUES WANT TO WORK WITH ME TO BRING THAT FORWARD, I CERTAINLY INVITE COLLABORATORS ON THE PROCESS.
00:37:22.392: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
00:37:23.260: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I GUESS I WILL THIRD OR FOURTH THE THE PRAISE FOR THE POLICE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION. IT'S GOOD TO HEAR WHAT'S GOING ON. I HAD THE DITINK  DISTINCT PLEAF HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH MS. JEAN FROM THE COORDINATOR FROM THE CITY. THEY ARE GETTING A LOT OF PHONE CALLS AND PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN REACHING OUT TO THE CITY AND FIND OUT WHAT RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE TO THEM. I THINK THAT ALONE SPEAKS TO THE SUCCESSES OF THAT AND I'M HAPPY TO HEAR ABOUT THAT. WHAT ELSE DO WE HAVE GOING HERE? WELL, THERE'S A LOT. I GUESS I WILL -- BRIEFLY, I WILL GIVE YOU AN UPDATE FROM THE CENTER CITY TASK FORCE. WE DIVIDED UP INTO SEVERAL SUBCOMMITTEES AND A LOT IS GETTING DONE AND IT'S PRETTY INTERESTING. THE FIRST PUBLIC OUTREACH SESSION WILL BE NOVEMBER 6th, A WEDNESDAY, AND NOVEMB NOVEMBER 6th THAT WILL BE AT THE DOWNTOWN LIBRARY, WHERE WE ARE BOUNCING AROUND ROOM SPACES. WE ARE NOT SURE OF THE TIMING. THIS WILL BE A COUPLE OF PUBLIC OUTREACH SITUATIONS FOR FOLKS TO COME OUT THERE AND SHARE THEIR VISION. AND SOME OF THE OUTREACH HAVE COME UP WITH GOALS FOR THE PRESENTATION. IT WILL BE I APRESEN A PRESENTAA Q&A AND A LISTENING SESSION. MOST IMPORTANTLY A LISTENING SESSION. I'M REAL HAPPY WITH THAT. AND THEN I GUESS THE LAST THING IS JUST TO PUT OUT THERE, WE ARE DOING A REVIEW OF ALL THE RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA LAWS TONIGHT AND IN THE SPIRIT OF FIRE SAFETY WEEK, I WILL POINT OUT THAT MOST FIRES ARE CAUSED BY SMOKING.
00:39:04.561: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
00:39:05.495: >> Councilmember Bannister: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER AND I HAVE TWO WARD 1 EVENTS COMING UP TO INVITE THE WHOLE COMMUNITY TO, NO MATTER WHAT WARD YOU ARE FROM. SIMILAR TO WARD 3. WE ARE HAVING CHIEF COX COME VISIT WITH US AT THE ARROWWOOD COMMUNITY CENTER ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT, OCTOBER 16 FROM 7 TO 9 P.M. AND SO CHIEF COX WILL VISIT WITH US. AND THEN ALSO BOTH COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER AND I WILL BE THIS TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AND GIVE AN UPDATE ON WHAT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON AND EVERYONE IS INVITED TO THE OLD FOURTH WARD MEETING, AT THE USUAL LOCATION, THE ST. ANDREW'S CHURCH ON FORTH DIVISION. AND THIS TIME, WE ARE GOING TO NOT BE IN THE LITTLE CHAPEL, WE WILL BE IN THE FULL CONGREGATION ROOM. SO WE WILL HAVE ROOM FOR EVERYONE. AND I BELIEVE CHIEF COX IS ALSO GOING TO -- HAS BEEN INVITED TO JOIN US THERE -- OH, I'M GETTING A SIGNAL. HE'S NOT COMING TO THAT UP. WITH ANYWAY, COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER AND I WILL BE THERE TO AGAIN ENGAGE WITH THE COMMUNITY, TELL FOLKS WHAT WE HAVE BEEN UP TO, AND ANSWER QUESTIONS AND HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS AND. SO MARK YOUR CALENDARS FOR THE 16th AND 22nd. THANK YOU.
00:40:27.410: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
00:40:29.112: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I WOULD LIKE TO JUST ALSO ADD MY THANKS AND APPRECIATION FOR ALL THE HARD WORK OF OUR OUTSTANDING ICPOC GROUP. IT'S AN HONOR TO SERVE WITH YOU AND TONIGHT ONCE AGAIN, YOU MADE US ALL VERY PROUD. YOU ARE DOING OUTSTANDING WORK FOR THE COMMUNITY. IT WAS A GREAT UPDATE. VERY INFORMATIVE AND I KNOW YOU WILL BE RETURNING WITH FUTURE UPDATES. YOU HAVE LEARNED A LOT THAT YOU ARE GOING TO SHARING WITH ALL OF US FROM ATTENDING THE NACOL CONFERENCE THAT WAS RECENTLY HELD IN DETROIT AND SO YOU ARE GOING TO BE BRINGING ALL OF THOSE BEST PRACTICES HERE. AND I THAN THINK THIS UPDATE --S REALLY EXCEPTIONAL I HAVE TO SAY, I'M A LITTLE BIASED. PROFESSOR JACKSON AND OTHERS, I KNOW, ALL YES. IT'S A TEAM EFFORT, AND IT SHOWS. THANK YOU. PERHAPS WE COULD ADD THAT TO THE WEBSITE WHICH IS, YEAH, IN PROGRESS. IT'S BEING DEVELOPED. BUT AS YOU CAN ALL SEE, THIS GROUP HAS BEEN DOING GREAT WORK AND -- AND IT WILL BE CONTINUING, OBVIOUSLY. BECAUSE IT'S IN VERY GOOD HANDS. SO THANK YOU VERY, VERY MUCH. AND THEN I ALSO APPRECIATE THAT COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI SHARED WITH EVERYONE THAT WE HAD OUR -- OUR COMMUNITY HAD A GREAT LOSS LAST NIGHT WITH THE PASSING OF MARY HATHAWAY, WHO IS REALLY A FOUNDING MOTHER OF THIS WONDERFULWONDERFUL COMMUNITY OFD OUR THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS GO OUT TO THE HATHAWAY FAMILY, CERTAINLY. AND JUST FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO MAY NOT HAVE KNOWN MARY, SHE WAS ALL ABOUT ALL THINGS WONDERFUL. SHELTERING THE HOMELESS, PROTECTING REFUGEES, RECYCLING, HISTORIC PRESERVATION, STEWARDSHIP OF NATURAL AREAS, YOU NAME THE CAUSE. SHE WORKED WITH MR. HATHAWAY, WHO PASSED AWAY MANY YEARS AGO, WAS A FORMER COUNCILMEMBER, THEY COLLABORATED TO HELP TO SAVE THE MICHIGAN THEATER. AND SHE TOOK THE LEAD ON SO MANY OF THESE GOOD CAUSES, IMPORTANT CAUSES AND FOR THE PAST NINE YEARS, SHE'S DEVOTED SO MUCH ENERGY TO PROMOTING THE IDEA OF HAVING AN ACTIVE PUBLIC SPACE AT THE LIBRARY LOT, AND THE CITY CHARTER AMENDMENT AND ALL THE WORK THAT WENT ALONG WITH THAT. SO SHE WAS QUITE A VISIONARY AND SO DEDICATED TO MAKING THIS COMMUNITY A BETTER PLACE. AND I APPRECIATE THAT COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, YOU ARE BRINGING FORWARD THIS RESOLUTION TO QUICKLY REPLACE -- TO REPLACE MS. SI SIP ES. THEIR WORK IS VERY IMPORTANT AND WE NEED TO MAKE THAT WORK AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND I SUSPECT THAT MARY IS LOOKING DOWN SMILING AND SAYING THANKS FOR THAT. THANK YOU.
00:43:44.808: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRIZ WALD.
00:43:46.309: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I APPRECIATE ALL THE POSITIVE COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE, AND I ALSO WILL MISS MARY HATHAWAY. SHE TOUCHED MY LIFE. A COUPLE OF ISSUES. NOT ISSUES. MY ADULT CHILDREN ARE SENDING ME TO NEW YORK CITY ROUND TRIP TO ATTEND A VISION ZERO CONFERENCE LATER THIS WEEK, AND I'M HOPING TO SCHEDULE ANOTHER COMMUNITY CONVERSATION IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS. SO THERE WILL BE MORE NEWS ABOUT THAT. AND I ALSO WANT TO THANK ADAM OXNER FOR READING THROUGH THE RESOLUTION, DC-1 AND JUST PROVIDE A COUPLE OF EXPLANATIONS. ONE IS THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR USUALLY WRITES MY RESOLUTIONS AND FREQUENTLY THE FEEDBACK IS THAT THERE ARE A LITTLE TOO HARSH AND CONTROLLING, BUT IT'S HIS LANGUAGE, NOT MINE. AND I'M ACTUALLY ON THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION. I'M THE LIAISON FROM COUNCIL AND WE DIVIDED UP SOME OF THE WORK WITH THE SIX Es. AND SO I HAVE HAD THE EVALUATION RESPONSIBILITIES. SO THAT'S ONE. OF THE REASONS FOR THIS RESOLUTION. I AGREE WITH YOU, SOMETIMES IT SEEMS LIKE WE COULD JUST MAKE A ONE-ON-ONE REQUEST BUT WITH THE OPEN MEETINGS ACT, I FEEL VERY STRONGLY THAT OUR COMMUNICATIONS WITH OUR CITY ADMINISTRATOR NEEDS TO BE THROUGH RESOLUTIONS AND WHILE THIS IS SOMETIMES BURDENSOME, I THINK IT IS MORE TRANSPARENT, BUT THANK YOU.
00:45:24.707: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER COMMUNICATION. I WOULD LIKE TO RECOMMEND THE FOLLOWING NOMINATIONS FOR CONSIDERATION. TO THE ANN ARBOR PUBLIC ART COMMISSION, PEGGY WIER LEONARD. AND JULIA PRESSEL, AND TO THE DOWNTOWN DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY, ANDREA DIECK. TO THE HISTORIC DISTRICT COMMISSION, KATHRYN FORTENER. TO THE PUBLIC ART COMMISSION, SOPHIE GRILLET, TO THE DOWNTOWN DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY, MICA BARTLEMAY AND TO THE ELIZABETH DEAN FUND COMMITTEE, ELIZABETH COLLINS. WE NOW HAVE BEFORE US THE CONSENT AGENDA. MAY I HAVE A MOTION TO APPROVE THE CONSENT. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER NELSON. DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
00:46:08.418: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WOULD LIKE TO REMOVE CA-11 FOR SEPARATE CONVERSATION.
00:46:17.527: >> Mayor Taylor: CA-11. COUNCICOUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
00:46:21.130: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A COUPLE OF COMMENTS ABOUT CA-3 AND CA4 AND WOULD IT BE APPROPRIATE TO DO IT NOW OR LATER? NOW? OH, OKAY. BOTH OF THESE ARE RESOLUTIONS IDENTIFYING PROPERTY THAT'S BEEN TRANSFERRED OVER TO THE CITY FROM DEVELOPERS. AND I THINK IT MAY BE USEFUL GOING FORWARD THAT WE EVALUATE THESE PROPERTIES THAT DEVELOPERS ARE GIVING US, BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO CONFLICT WITH WHAT I'M HEARING THAT WE CAN'T PURCHASE PROPERTY WITH GREEN BELT FUNDS BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO MAINTAIN THAT PROPERTY, EITHER AS A NATURAL AREA OR AS A PARK. AND SO I'M FAMILIAR WITH SOME OF THESE PIECES OF LAND THAT DEVELOPERS HAVE GIVEN US AND FREQUENTLY THEY ARE INFERIOR AND THEY ARE SMALL. I HAVE A COUPLE IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD AND I DON'T SEE THEM CONTRIBUTING MUCH TO OUR COMMUNITY OTHER THAN FOR THE TREE CANOPY THAT THEY PROVIDE.
00:47:35.271: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE CONSENT AGENDA. COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
00:47:40.343: >> Councilmember Grand: THOSE PROPERTIES WERE EVALUATED BY PARK STAFF AND PARK STAFF WHEN THEY LOOKED AT THE DEVELOPMENTS ACTUALLY MADE A SPECIFIC REQUEST FOR THOSE PIECES OF LAND. IF YOU LOOK AT WHERE THEY ARE, THERE'S CONNECTIVITY TO EXISTING NATURAL AREAS. THEY ALSO FORM SORT OF AN ARCH ALONG THE NORTHERN PART OF THE CITY. IT WAS ALSO IN RESPONSE TO A LOT OF NEIGHBORS' CONCERNS ABOUT WHAT PIECES OF PROPERTY THEY WANTED. SO THEY ARE NOT TERRIBLY EXPENSIVE TO MAINTAIN, BUT THEY WERE EVALUATED BY NATURAL AREA PRESERVATION AND THEIR WISE INPUT INTO THEM AND WERE LOOKED AT, YOU KNOW, IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE EXISTING DEVELOPMENT TO HELP, IN ADDITION WITH PEDESTRIAN AND NON-MOTORIZED CONNECTIVITY BECAUSE THERE WILL BE A PATH THAT COMES OUT OF ONE OF THOSE AREAS. BUT IT CONNECTS IT TO ANOTHER ONE.
00:48:35.264: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
00:48:38.568: >> Councilmember Griswold: THAT'S GREAT NEWS BECAUSE PROPERTIES THAT I'M FAMILIAR WITH ARE PROBABLY 30, 40 YEARS AGO ACQUIRED BY THE CITY AND SO IT LOOK LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE REALY IMPROVED OUR PROCESS.
00:48:51.814: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. ALL IN FAVOR OF THE CONSENT AGENDA WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CA-11. [CHORUS OF AYES] IT'S APPROVED WITH 11 UP COULD COUNCILMEMBERS PRESENT, WITH% TO CA-7, CA-14 AND THAT IS ALL. IS THAT RIGHT? YES, CA-11. RESOLUTION AUTHORIZING PUBLICATION OF NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE GENERAL OBLIGATION CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT BONDS TO FUND DOWNTOWN DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY ANN ASHLEY PARKING STRUCTURE EXPANSION PROJECT. MOVED BY LUMM AND SECONDED. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
00:49:35.892: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I THINK THIS ITEM IS A LITTLE PREMATURE FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS. ONE, NEXT WEEK IS A WORK SESSION, THE JOINT WORK SESSION WITH THE D.D. AA., THE DOWNTOWN DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY. THAT'S AT CTN. MY APOLOGIES. IT'S ON CTN ON SOUTH INDUSTRIAL AT 7:00. AND I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE THAT CONVERSATION WITH THEM BEFORE WE OFFER UP THE FULL FAITH AND CREDIT TO THE TUNE OF $23 MILLION, WHICH IS ACTUALLY $28 MILLION BY THE TIME WE GET DONE REPAYING THE BONES. I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE TO POSTPONE THIS UNTIL THE NEXT MEETING IN OCTOBER, OR WHATEVER MY COLLEAGUES WOULD THINK IS AN APPROPRIATE TEAM.
00:50:20.169: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE A SECOND? SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER SMITH. DISCUSSION?
00:50:26.542: >> Councilmember Hayner:  SO THIS WILL BE THE NEXT MEETING? OCTOBER?
00:50:30.379: >> Mayor Taylor: CORRECT.
00:50:30.947: >> Councilmember Hayner:  THE 21st.
00:50:32.715: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE ANY -- IF I COULD ASK, IS THERE ANY REASON WHY THAT CAN'T BE DONE FROM A STAFF'S PERSPECTIVE? ALL RIGHT. FURTHER DISCUSSION?
00:50:42.925: >> Councilmember Lumm: WHAT WAS POSTPONED?
00:50:44.527: >> Mayor Taylor: TO OUR NEXT MEETING. ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT'S POSTPONED. WE NOW COME TO A SET OF PUBLIC HEARINGS. PUBLIC HEARINGS ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO SPEAK TO COUNCIL AND THE COMMUNITY ABOUT A SPECIFIC ITEM ON THE AGENDA. THAT IS THE SPECIFIC SUBJECT OF THE PUBLIC HEARING. WHEN YOU SPEAK AT A PUBLIC HEARING, YOUR SPEECH MUST RELATE TO THE SUBJECT OF THE PUBLIC HEARING. SPEAKERS HAVE THREE MINUTES IN WHICH TO SPEAK. SO PLEASE PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE TIME CLOCK. SPEAKERS NEED NOT HAVE SIGNED UP IN ADVANCE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC HEARINGS. WE CAN HAVE ONLY ONE PERSON SPEAKING AT A TIME AS A MATTER OF THE COURTESY AND FINALLY, IF YOU REQUIRE ASSISTANCE IN SPEAKING BEFORE COUNCIL, WE WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO PROVIDE IT TO YOU. PUBLIC HEARING NUMBER ONE, AN AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND CHAPTER 55 (ZONING), REZONING OF 0.54 ACRE FROM PUD (PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT) TO PUD (PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT), THE GLEN MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT PUD ZONING AND SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS, 201, 213, 215, 217 GLEN AVENUE AND 1025 EAST ANN STREET. IS THERE ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING. YOU NEED NOT RAISE YOUR HAND. JUST MOSEY ON UP TO THE PODIUM.
00:52:01.604: >> MY NAME IS JEFF CROCKETT. I LIVE AT 506 EAST KINGSLEY WHICH IS NOT FAR FROM THE GLEN HOTEL SITE AND I'M SPEAKING IN FAVOR OF THIS PROJECT. WE REALLY -- OUR ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN WORKING WITH THE DEVELOPER FOR QUITE A WHILE ON THIS. AND WE HAVE FOUND THEM TO BE REALLY RESPONSIVE. THE GLEN STREET WAS A REAL ISSUE IN TERMS OF THE ONE-WAY STREET AND FIGURING THERE WOULD BE A LOT OF CARS COMING THROUGH THE NEIGHBORHOOD. AND NORM TYLER WORKED WITH THE CITY AND THE DEVELOPER TO PROPOSE A REAL COOL SOLUTION, WHERE A SECTION OF GLEN STREET WOULD BE TWO WAY, OFF OF GLEN INTO THE HOTEL, WHICH WE LIKED. I REALLY LIKE THE FACT THAT THERE ARE 252 PARKING SPACES. AND THIS IS GOING TO COME UP WITH AN ISSUE LATER ON WITH A DIFFERENT HOTEL, THAT HAS A DIFFERENT, YOU KNOW, PARKING PROPOSAL. SO IN OTHER WORDS, THE FACT THAT THERE ARE 252 PARKING SPOTS MEANS THESE PEOPLE WILL NOT BE GOING THROUGH OUR NEIGHBORHOOD WHICH IS REALLY IMPORTANT. SO WE SORT OF LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENED WITH THIS DEVELOPER AS AN EXAMPLE FOR WHAT WE WANT ALL DEVELOPERS TO DO, IN TERMS OF INPUT WITH NEIGHBORHOODS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
00:53:27.723: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING? SEEING TO ONE, THIS PUBLIC HEARING IS CLOSED. PUBLIC HEARING NUMBER TWO, RESOLUTION TO APPROVE THE GLEN MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT MODIFIED PUD SITE PLAN, 201, 213, 215, 217 GLEN AVENUE AND 1025 EAST ANN STREET. IS THERE ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING? SEEING NO ONE, THIS PUBLIC HEARING IS --
00:53:57.653: >> MAYOR?
00:53:58.053: >> Mayor Taylor: MY APOLOGIES.
00:54:05.694: >> MY APOLOGIES AS WELL. MY NAME IS JAMES DEMORE. I'M A NEARBY RESIDENT AT THE PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT, ALTHOUGH I'M JUST A COUPLE OF BLOCKS EAST. JUST SOME NOTES HERE. I HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THIS PROPOSAL FOR SOMETIME, THE VARIOUS ITERATIONS. I SPOKEN BEFORE YOU WITH RESPECT TO THIS PROJECT. AND --
00:54:32.721: >> Mayor Taylor: I THINK YOU ARE ON THE WRONG PUBLIC HEARING. THIS WITH RESPECT TO THE GLEN ON -- THE GLEN HOTEL ON ANN STREET.
00:54:38.494: >> OH, MY GOODNESS GRACIOUS! I WONDERED WHY THERE WAS HESITATION. MY ADDRESS OF RECORD SINCE I DON'T LIVE NEAR THAT IS 2771 MAPLEWOOD AVENUE, ANN ARBOR, MICHIGAN.
00:54:53.476: >> Mayor Taylor: HANG OUT THERE. YOU WILL BE FIRST IN THE PUBLIC HEARING NUMBER THREE. [ LAUGHTER ] IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC HEARING NUMBER TWO, WITH RESPECT TO THE GLEN? SEEING NO ONE, THIS PUBLIC HEARING IS CLOSED. PUBLIC HEARING NUMBER THREE, AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND CHAPTER 55 (ZONING), REZONING OF 7.7 ACRES FROM R1E (SINGLE-FAMILY DWELLING DISTRICT) WITH CONDITIONS TO PUD (PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT), WEBER REZONING, 2857 PACKARD ROAD. IS THERE ANYBODY WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING. AGAIN, PLEASE JUST MOSEY ON UP AND SOME CROWD SOURCED CUE.
00:55:33.849: >> SO I'M SURE THERE WILL BE A VERY -- RON LEV, 2645 EASY STREET, THERE'S MANY, MANY WHO WILL BE SPEAKING REGARDING THIS. THE PLAN FOR THIS SITE, THE PROPOSED PLAN IS A TERRIBLE PLAN! YOU WILL BE HEARING MANY, MANY SEASONS WHY IT'S A TERRIBLE PLAN FROM MY NEIGHBORS. A LOT OF THEM BOIL DOWN TO THE TREES ON THE SITE, AND THE DENSITY AND THE CHARACTER OF THE DEVELOPMENT VERSUS THE CHARACTER OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD. THIS IS A SIGNIFICANTLY LARGE SITE, AND THE COMMUNITY HAS A SIGNIFICANT STAKE IN ITS DISPOSITION. THIS IS NOT A MERE PRIVATE TRANSACTION OF A PRIVATE OWNER DEVELOPING THEIR LAND WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO PRIVATE OWNERSHIP AND THE RIGHTS OF PROPERTY OWNERS. THERE'S BEEN A SENSE OF INEVITABILITY REGARDING THIS PLAN FROM THE DAY IT WAS FIRST INTRODUCED BEFORE THE CITY REZONED THE R1E AND ACCEPTED THE ORIGINAL AREA PLAN. IT WAS DEEMED INN EVITABLE THAT THE PROPERTY HAD TO GET DEVELOPED AND DENSELY DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPED ACCORDING TO THE WAY THIS DEVELOPER DID IT. ANY -- ESSENTIALLY THE VISION OF THIS PLAN CAME FROM THE DEVELOPER TO SQUEEZE AS MUCH PRO E FIT AS THEY CAN FROM THE LAND. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO THEM, THAT'S THEIR JOB AND ALL WE HAVE DONE AS THE COMMUNITY, THE COUNCIL HAS BEEN CHIPPING AWAY AND SLIGHTLY MITIGATE THIS HORRIBLE PLAN. WHAT I'M PROPOSING IS YOU TURN DOWN THE PUD, YOU TURN DOWN THE PLAN, WE STOP ACTING LIKE THIS IS INEVITABLE AND BE AFRAID OF ALL THE THREATS OF LAWSUITS AND HORRIBLE THINGS THAT WILL HAPPEN IF WE DON'T DO THIS PARTICULAR PLAN. AND GO BACK TO THE DRAWING COMMUNITY AND ENGAGE THE COMMUNITY AND CREATE A VISION FOR THE SITE, THAT SUITS THE NEIGHBORHOODS AND THE DEVELOPER AND FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET TO THE END GOAL. THERE WILL BE A COST TO MAKE DIRECTIONS BECAUSE DECISIONS WERE MADE BY THE CITY. IN FACT, WE ARE CONVINCED IT WAS THE WRONG DECISION. IT'S BETTER TO CHANGE DIRECTION AFTER A WRONG DECISION, THAN TO KEEP GOING BECAUSE YOU ARE AFRAID. WHAT WE HEARD FROM MANY COUNCILMEMBERS, NOT ALL, BUT OH, THERE'S NO CHOICES. OUR HANDS ARE BOUND. I WANT TO CALL B.S. ON THAT. THERE ARE COSTS AND RU RISKS AND IT'S YOUR JOB TO TAKE THOSE RISKS AS A RESULT OF THE BETTER OF THE COMMUNITY. IT WILL IRREVOCABLY REPLACE A LARGE WOODLAND AND PUT A MONSTROSITY INTO THE NEIGHBORHOOD. I DON'T WANT YOU TO HAVE I ACLOSED MIND, SAYING ALL OF THESE DREAMERS WANT SOMETHING DIFFERENT BUT WE CAN'T HAVE IT. I WANT YOU TO SAY MAYBE A BIG MISTAKE WAS MADE AND ADDRESS THE CONCERNS EVEN IF IT'S HARD, EVEN IF IT REQUIRES RISK. I GUESS THAT'S IT.
00:58:39.068: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. [ APPLAUSE ]
00:58:43.005: >> HELLO, MY NAME IS RICHARD TAYLOR, I LIVE AT 2814CARNBROOK. SO WHEN THE PREVIOUS CITY COUNCIL MADE THE DECISION TO REZONE THIS LAND FROM R1C TO R1E, THERE WAS ALREADY A CITY FOREST WRITE RE VIGOROUSLY OPPOG THAT PLAN. WE WROTE A LETTER TRYING TO GET THE PREVIOUS CITY COUNCIL TO PAY ATTENTION TO THAT REPORT. IN RETROSPEAK, I THINK IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT THE SHOE HORN 51 HOUSES OR 51 HOUSES AND CONDOMINIUMS NOW ON 7.7 ACRES OF LAND WITH 57 LANDMARK TREES ON IT, THAT THAT WAS A BAD IDEA. THE PRESENT PUD PLAN WOULD STILL REMOVE 38 LANDMARKED TREES. TONIGHT, I ALSO HAVE THE FEAR THAT ANYTHING THAT YOUR CONSTITUENTS SAY TONIGHT WILL BE OF NO CONSEQUENCE BECAUSE YOU ARE BEING THREATENED WITH THE LAWSUIT AND THAT'S SAY SAD SITUATION. AND I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE UNDER -- YOU ARE IN A TOUGH POSITION AT THIS POINT. THE GROVE OF TREES APPROXIMATELY 300 YEARS OLD WILL BE SPARED BUT THE TRADEOFF DOES APPEAR TO BE ATTACHED HOUSING, WHICH IS INCONSISTENT WITH THE NEIGHBORHOOD, AND FREE RAIN TO REMOVE 38 OTHER LANDMARKED TREES. SO LOOKING FORWARD, I DO SUPPORT YOU IN CONTINUING TO ADVOCATE FOR RESPONSIBLE DEVELOPMENT WITH THIS CITY COUNCIL. AND DEVELOPMENT THAT IS JUDICIOUSLY APPROVED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME.
01:00:30.045: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. [ APPLAUSE ]
01:00:33.048: >> HI, MY NAME IS EMILY MILLER EPSTEIN, I LIVE AT 2601 EASY STREET. MY HUSBAND, MY NINE AND A HALF-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER AND I JUST MOVED THIS A YEAR AGO. WE LOVE OUR NEIGHBORHOOD. I HAVE WRITTEN TO THE CITY COUNCIL AND MY WARD REPS TWICE, BEFORE TODAY. AND NEVER HEARD A PEEP FROM EITHER OF YOU. AND THAT'S REALLY SAD BECAUSE THAT'S ABDICATING YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO YOUR CONSTITUENTS TO REPRESENT US AND TO LISTEN. I JUST WANT TO HARP, IF YOU WILL, ON THE FACT THAT ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC SUSTAINABILITY IS NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE. THEY ARE -- SINCE TIME AND MEMORIAL INTERTWINED. DO YOU KNOW THAT THE MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME FOR THIS CITY IN 2017 ASK -- I BELIEVE IT'S $77,000. IF ONE EARNING THE MEDIAN INCOME WANTS TO PURCHASE ONE OF THESE SMALL, EXPENSIVE HOMES ABOUT $400,000, IS THE PRICE POINT AN INDIVIDUAL EARNING THE MEDIAN INCOME MUST PUT DOWN 40 TO $120,000 FOR THE MORTGAGE. IF YOU TALK TO SOMEONE LIKE ME, I'M 41. I FINISHED MY Ph.D. AT WISCONSIN WITH MY HUSBAND A FEW YEARS AGO AND WE ARE MOVING INTO THIS NEIGHBORHOOD. WE HAVE TWO MORTGAGES ALREADY, OUR STUDENT LOANS AND NOW OUR HOUSE THAT WE LOVE. AND THEN COME TO FIND OUT, THERE'S BEEN NO FORESIGHT INTO THE PLANNING OF THIS. I JUST -- IT'S -- IT'S GREEN WASHING AT THE HIGHEST HEIGHTS. FIND IT DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT ELECTED SERVANTS WOULD HAVE SUCH A POOR COMMAND OF CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND THEY ARE INTERRELATIONSHIPS WITH SPECIFIC DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS LIKE THE SOON TO BE REFUGEE MIDDLE CLASS. MAYBE THEN IT WILL BE A SUBJECT OF CONCERN. THESE ARE NOT STARTER HOMES OR STARTER HOUSEHOLDS. THESE HOMES HOUSE REAL AND NOBLE PEOPLE. THE VAST NUMBER OF RETIREES THAT LIVE IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD WILL BE PUSHED OUT, AS PROPERTY TAXES RISE WITH ABSURD HOUSING COSTS UNDER THIS PROPOSED PUD. A SCENARIO THAT HAS PLAYED OUT ALL OVER THE U.S. AD NAUSEAM. THE PUDs WILL NOT BE AN OPTION FOR YOUNG FAMILIES STRUGGLING WITH OUTRAGEOUS STUDENT DEBT, CHILD CARE OR INSURANCE PREMIUMS. AS AN ECONOMIC GROWTH OR DEMOGRAPHIC GROUP FOR MY PARTICULAR GENERATION, WE ARE SIMPLY NOT COMPENSATED AT THE LEVEL OF BOOMERS. IT'S JUST THAT'S THE TRUTH. AND THE FACT THAT THE COMPLETE ABDICATION OF RESPONSIBILITY TO CONSIDER THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS REQUIRED TO MAKE THESE -- YES, I'M LOUD. I THINK I JUST HEARD THAT. I HAVE TO BE LOUD SO THEY CAN HEAR ME. ABDICATION TO CONSIDER THE TRAFFIC CONJESTION, THE WATER INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S REQUIRED, IT'S -- IT WAS NEVER DONE. I JUST DON'T SEE IT. I MEAN CERTAINLY YOU NEVER TALKED TO ME ABOUT IT, BUT, YOU KNOW -- AND THAT'S MY TIME.
01:03:38.934: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. [ APPLAUSE ]
01:03:43.839: >> HELLO, MY NAME IS ORA BLACHE. I LIVE AT 2907 CHESTERFIELD. WE ARE JUST SLIGHTLY OUT OF THE 100-YARD RANGE. I REALLY FEEL AT THIS POINT THAT THE CITY COUNCIL AND THE PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING WITH OUR DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITIES HAVE REALLY SOLD OUT OUR AREA. I DON'T FEEL LIKE ANY OF US HAVE REALLY BEEN ASKED. I DON'T THINK THAT A LOT HAS BEEN PUT INTO WHAT'S GOING ON HERE. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT, YOU KNOW, I JUST WANTED TO BRING UP IS THAT BACK IN 2014, $400,000 WAS SPENT TO MOVE ONE BURR OAK 100 YARDS. I WANT TO KNOW WHERE THIS TREE MATTERED SO MUCH WHERE OUR TREES DON'T. IT'S NOT RIGHT. IT SEEMS THAT -- [ APPLAUSE ] -- SO MUCH OF WHAT IS PUT INTO THE CITY IS IN -- WHERE U OF M EXISTS AND THEN ONCE YOU STEP OUTSIDE OF THAT, THE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN HERE FOR YEARS JUST CEASE TO MATTER. ALLEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL THAT IS, THERE OUR ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN OUR COMMUNITY, LAST YEAR, WE HIRED A FIFTH GRADE TEACHER THAT WE DID NOT HAVE CLASSROOM SPACE TO BE ABLE TO PUT HER IN. OUR SCHOOL IS RUNNING OUT OF SPACE TO BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF OUR EXISTING POPULATION THAT IS ALREADY GROWING. ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU ADD IN SCHOOL OF CHOICE AND EVERYTHING LIKE THAT. OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT IS VERY AWESOME, BUT THERE NEEDS TO BE SOMETHING PUT IN PLACE, YOU KNOW, THIS PUD DOES GO INTO EXISTENCE, THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE SOMETHING ADDED ON TO OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS BECAUSE IT JUST CAN'T TAKE ON ALL THESE ADDED PEOPLE. WE HAVE SO MANY HOMES THAT HAVE BACKLOGGED SEWER OVER THE YEARS. SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE HAD TO DO COMPLETE IN-HOME REMODELS AS THEY HAVE HAD SUMP PUMP DISASTERS. I DON'T THINK THAT THE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE WILL BE ABLE TO HANDLE THE ADDED ACCESS OF ALL OF THESE 50 OTHER HOUSES THAT AT THE WANT TO PUSH IN SUCH A SMALL AREA OF LAND! I MEAN YORK EVEN UNDERSTAND WHY SOMEONE WOULD WANT TO SPEND SO MUCH MONEY TO HAVE SO LITTLE YARD SPACE AND TO BE ABLE TO HAVE SO LITTLE TREES AND EVERYTHING THAT WE ALREADY TAKE IN OUR COMMUNITY THAT WE STAND UP FOR. I THINK OVER AND OVER, OUR COMMUNITY IS BEING ASKED TO SACRIFICE. AND THEN HOW DO WE GET DOWN TO PACKARD? THEN 4:30 AND 7:00, IT'S A STANDSTILL! I CAN'T MAKE A LEFT OUT OF MY NEIGHBORHOOD AS IT IS. WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF CARS NOW COMING THROUGH OUR NEIGHBORHOOD TO TRY AND AVOID ALL OF THIS. THESE THINGS NEED TO BE ADDRESSED. [ APPLAUSE ]
01:06:49.024: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
01:06:55.430: >> GOOD EVENING. MY NAME IS BRYCE BELLCAMP, I LIVE AT 2869 EASY STREET. SO MY BACKYARD WILL BE PUTTING G UP AGAINST SOME OF THE BACKYARDS, I GUESS IF YOU CAN CALL THEM THAT OF THE NEW DEVELOPMENT PROPOSED HERE. RENTING IN ANN ARBOR FOR ABOUT THE LAST 13 YEARS, I FIGURED IT WAS TIME TO PUT DOWN SOME ROOTS AND TIME TO BUY SOMETHING. AND LOOKING AROUND, IT BECAME VERY CLEAR TO ME, VERY EARLY ON THAT PROBABLY THE ONLY AREA OF THE CITY THAT I COULD AFFORD TO BUY IN WAS AROUND THE PACKARD AND PLATTE AREA AND WORKING THE NONPROFIT, THAT'S THE CASE FOR ALL OF MY COWORKERS, WE ARE CENTERED AROUND THE PACKARD AND PLATTE AREA. AND THAT'S ABOUT THE ONLY PLACE IN THE CITY THAT WE COULD AFFORD AND PROBABLY MANY OF MY GENERATION, THAT'S ABOUT THE ONLY PLACE IN THE CITY THAT WE COULD AFFORD. IF THIS PUD MOVES FORWARD, AND THERE ARE HOMES THAT ARE GOING FOR AROUND $400,000, I HAVE TO WONDER AND ASK, IS THERE GOING TO REMAIN ANY PART OF ANN ARBOR THAT IS GOING TO REMAIN SOMEWHAT AFFORDABLE FOR PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE HOMES AND EVEN AS SOME OF MY NEIGHBORS HAVE MENTIONED, FOR YOUNGER PEOPLE TO MOVE INTO THE CITY, WHICH, OF COURSE, YOU WILL NEED YOUNGER GENERATIONS MOVING INTO YOUR CITY. AND SO I REALLY LOVE MY NEIGHBORHOOD. IT IS A GREAT PLACE. I HAD A NEW ROOMMATE MOVE IN AND HIS PARENTS WERE TAKING PICTURES OF THE WOODS THERE. I'M NOT AGAINST DEVELOPMENT, BUT AS MANY NEIGHBORS WILL CITE, THERE ARE A LOT OF ISSUES REGARDING TEARING DOWN MANY LAND LANDMARK TREES THERE, THE INCREASED CONGESTION THAT WILL LIKELY BE FACED ON PACKARD ROAD, LET ALONE THE FACT THAT THE DENSITY DOES NOT MATCH THE SURROUNDING NEIGHBORHOODS. IF YOU TAKE THE NINE HOUSES ON MY SIDE OF THE STREET THAT LINE UP AGAINST THE PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT, ALONG WITH THE NINE HOUSES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET, SO 18 HOUSES ALL TO GO AND YOU TRANSPOSE THAT TO WHERE THE PUD IS PROPOSED, THAT BASICALLY FILLS UP THAT AREA. IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S FIT FOR ABOUT 18 TO 20 HOMES, NOT THE 50 OR PLUS SO HOMES THAT ARE CURRENTLY PROPOSED THERE. SO AS MANY HAVE SAID, I THINK THERE ARE MANY OTHER GREAT POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVES. I THINK IT IS WORTH EXPLORING. I THINK ANY FEARS AS TO GOING AHEAD AND SAYING, AYE TO THIS PROPOSAL, I THINK THE RISK IS WORTH IT TO CONTINUE TO EXPLORE WHAT OTHER POSSIBILITIES MAY BE AT HAND. [ APPLAUSE ]
01:09:39.561: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
01:09:46.201: >> GOOD EVENING. MARK BRADSHAW, 2969 EASY STREET. I FIRST MOVED INTO ANN ARBOR APPROXIMATELY 20 YEARS AGO, PART OF THIS TRAILING SPOUSE CLUB. AND WE FOUND AN AFFORDABLE HOUSE IN SOUTHEAST ANN ARBOR, WHICH USED TO BE A SEPARATE VILLAGE. IT HASN'T BEEN PART OF ANN ARBOR FOR ALL THAT LONG. IT STILL HAS A UNIQUE AREA IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD. IT'S A VERY DIVERSE NEIGHBORHOOD. 20 YEARS LATER, AFTER A DIVORCE AND RETIRING FROM U OF M, I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO HAVE TO LEAVE ANN ARBOR, BUT I WENT BACK TO THIS NEIGHBORHOOD AND FOUND A HOUSE ON EASY STREET. TWO BEDROOM RANCH ON A SLAB. SIMPLE HOUSE. THERE'S A REASON WHY THIS HOUSE IS A SMALL HOUSE ON A -- THAT DOES NOT HAVE A BASEMENT. MANY STREET -- MANY HOUSES ON THAT STREET DON'T HAVE BASEMENTS BECAUSE OF THE LAY OF THE LAND THERE, WE ARE ON THE WATERSHED ON THE CREEK THERE. THERE'S ABOUT 18 INCHES OF TOPSOIL AND THEN IT'S CLAY. I HAD TO TAKE OUT A COUPLE OF TREES MANY MY YARD BECAUSE THEY CAN'T PUT DOWN ROOTS. THEY ARE GROWING UNDERNEATH MY HOUSE AND ONE THREATENED TO FALL ON MY HOUSE AFTER D.E.T. CAME AND TRIPPED HALF OF IT OFF BECAUSE OF THE POWER LINE ISSUES. AND -- SO ADDING THIS DENSITY OF HOUSING ON THAT TYPE OF LAND, BESIDES NOT FITTING IN WITH THE NEIGHBORHOOD, IT DOESN'T SEEM SAFE, AND IT'S NOT GOING -- -- I DON'T HAVE PREPARED REMARKS. SO I'M JUST KIND OF WINGING WITH ME HERE. BEAR WITH ME. I LOVE THIS NEIGHBORHOOD. IT REALLY IS A VERY NICE NEIGHBORHOOD, VERY DIVERSE, RETIREES, YOUNG COUPLES, SINGLE PEOPLE, NEIGHBOR ACROSS THE STREET IS FROM KENYA. A GUY COUPLE DOWN IS A DEEJAY FOR WCBN, Ph.D.s, PR PROFESSORS, SELF-EMPLOYEES PROFESSIONALS AND PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD. IT'S A VERY UNIQUE NEIGHBORHOOD. AND SO PUT UP A STREET OF GARAGE DOORS, LIKE PREVIOUS WEBER DEVELOPMENTS, WOULD JUST BE A CRIME. THANKS FOR LISTENING. [ APPLAUSE ]
01:12:07.408: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
01:12:17.886: >> HI, MY NAME IS KATHERINE HEADLEY, I LIVE AT 1618 EASY STREET. I WANT TO START BY SAYING THAT I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS IS A HARD DECISION. I DON'T THINK ANY OF YOU TOOK THIS LIGHTLY AND I WOULD NOT WANT TO BE IN YOUR PLACE RIGHT NOW. SO I JUST WANT TO TAKE A SECOND BEFORE I START TO SAY THAT. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHY I LOVE MY NEIGHBORHOOD. SO I LOVE MY NEIGHBORHOOD BECAUSE. AFFORDABILITY, THE AFFORDABILITY IN NEIGHBORHOOD CREATES THE DIVERSITY THAT IS THERE. MY NEIGHBORHOOD IS ONE OF THE LAST POCKETS OF MIDDLE CLASS IN ANN ARBOR, AND, YOU KNOW, WE TALK A LOT ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND FOR THAT REASON, YOU KNOW -- YOU KNOW, THAT'S FOR A GOOD REASON BECAUSE HOUSING AROUND HERE IS NOT AFFORDABLE FOR LOTS OF PEOPLE. FOR MYSELF, I FAIL TO SEE HOW THIS PROJECT QUALIFIES FOR THE VISION THAT CITY COUNCIL PAINTS FOR OUR TOWN. THE PUD IS SI SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH. IDEAS ARE OUT THERE, BUT TO MANY, THEY FEEL LIKE IT'S FALLING ON DEAF EARS AN I FEEL FOR MY NEIGHBORS WHO FEEL A LITTLE ABANDONED AND SILENCED DURING THIS PROCESS. IT'S EASY TO TOSS UP WALLS AND SAY THESE PEOPLE ARE NIMBYS AND I'M NOT HAVING THIS CONVERSATION, BUT THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH AND THAT CAN'T BE WHO WE ARE. WE MUST LEARN TO COMMUNICATE ON THINGS LIKE THIS IN OUR CITY. AND TO ME, THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN A FAILURE TO COMMUNICATE. WE NEED TO COME TOGETHER. GIVING UP ON THIS IS SENDING A MESSAGE TO MY NEIGHBORHOOD THAT YOU HAVE GIVEN UP ON US. WE CANNOT EVER WALK BACK THIS DECISION. WE WILL NEVER IN OUR LIFETIMES GET THIS NATURAL LANDSCAPE BACK. SOME OF THESE TREES ARE OLDER THAN ANN ARBOR ITSELF. WE HAVE TO CONSIDER THE FUTURE. I HAVE TWO CHILDREN AT HOME AND IT WOULD BE A LIE TO TELL THAT YOU I DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE IMPACT OF DEVELOPMENTS LIKE THESE FOR THEIR FUTURE. AND I UNDERSTAND -- I UNDERSTAND THE FEAR BEHIND NOT CHALLENGING THIS PROJECT. THE STAKES ARE HIGH, AND IT'S A MURKY PLACE LEGALLY FOR THE CITY, BUT THE STAKES WILL ALWAYS BE HIGH AND WE WILL SEE THIS AGAIN. AND MISTAKES ARE GOING TO HAPPEN AND FOR ME, THIS IS -- TONIGHT YOU HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT YOUR LEGACY WILL BE FOR OUR WARD AND THAT'S UP TO YOU AND TONIGHT, I HOPE WHEN YOU CAST YOUR VOTE, THAT YOU CONSIDER VOTING FOR THE VOICE OF PEOPLE AND I REALLY DEEPLY APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. THANK YOU.
01:14:39.594: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. [ APPLAUSE ]
01:14:44.565: >> ALL RIGHT. LET'S DO THIS. [ LAUGHTER ]
01:14:52.373: >> SORRY FOR THAT. BUT IT'S A LITTLE DISTURBING TO SO MCOME UP HERE BECAUSE I FEELT IS BEING DISCUSSED HERE, I HAVE BEEN HERE BEFORE AS A FORMER PLANNING COMMISSIONER FOR THE CITY. AND SEEING SOME OF THE CASTS OF CHARACTERS, BOTH IN TERMS OF THE PETITIONER, AND CITY STAFF, INCLUDING THE CITY ATTORNEY, AND THAT MEANS YOU, KEVIN, I FEEL THAT I'M SEEING SOME THINGS THAT JUST AREN'T RIGHT IN TERMS OF THE PROCESS. I UNDERSTAND THE DIFFICULT SITUATION THAT YOU ARE IN AS COUNCILMEMBERS. BUT I REALLY HATE THE IDEA OF GOVERNMENT AND ORDINANCE PASSING BY BLACKMAIL, BY THREAT OF LAWSUIT. [ APPLAUSE ] AND I HATE THE IDEA THAT FOR WHATEVER REASON, THIS IS INTIMIDATION ON THE PART OF NEIGHBORHOODS OR PARTICULARLY ON THE PART OF POLICYMAKERS, BE IT PLANNING COMMISSIONERS, OR CITY COUNCILMEMBERS, THAT THE CITY WILL NOT DEFEND YOU IN THE EVENT OF THE LAWSUIT IF YOU VOTE TO DENY A PROJECT. THAT'S SIMPLY NOT RIGHT. AND I'M NOT SURE -- I'M NOT PRIEFPRIVILEGED TO THIS BUT I FL THIS IS A POSSIBILITY OF WHAT I'M SEEING HERE. AND I THINK -- I'M ALSO CONCERNED IN SOMETHING THAT COUNCILMEMBER GRAND YOU WROTE A NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR IN RESPONSE TO A THREAD REGARDING THIS ISSUE, THAT YOU HAD A QUOTE, FIDUCIARY DUTY TO APPROVE THIS PROJECT. IS THIS PROJECT, INDEED, A MUST PASS? I THINK WITH THE PUD PROCESS, YOU WOULD HAVE SOME TOOLS THAT ARE AVAILABLE AND I WILL TALK TO YOU ABOUT THAT AT THE NEXT -- AT THE NEXT MEETING -- THE NEXT HEARING THAT'S UP ON THE AGENDA. AT ANY RATE, I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR TO ALL OF YOU, THAT YOU AS MEMBERS, COUNCIL, YOU ARE IN CHARGE OF THIS PROCESS. YOU REPRESENT THE CITIZENS OF THE CITY. AND WHETHER IT'S FORCES THAT CITY HALL, OR THE DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY, YOU DO WHAT IS RIGHT FOR THE CITY, WHAT YOU FEEL IS RIGHT, WHAT BENEFITS THE COMMUNITY. STAY IN CHARGE. STAY IN CONTROL. THANK YOU. [ APPLAUSE ]
01:17:21.756: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
01:17:25.860: >> HI, GOOD EVENING. I HAD NAME IS SUE SYMINGTON, AND I HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THIS PROJECT FOR THREE YEARS NOW. NOTHING MADE ME SO SAD TONIGHT AS TO HEAR ONE OF OUR OTHER RESIDENTS TALK ABOUT HOW A DEVELOPER WORKED WITH THEM -- WORKED TOGETHER ON A PROJECT THAT WE HAVE NOT SEEN IN THREE YEARS IN THIS SPECIFIC PROJECT. THIS IS HEART BREAKING FOR ALL OF US. I HAVE COME UP WITH MANY -- EVERY TIME I COME UP, I TALK THERE ARE ANIMALS THAT WILL BE DISPLAYED. I TALKED ABOUT SEWAGE. I'M THE ONE WOULD KEEPS SENDING YOU THIS PICTURE OF BURR PARK. WE HAD A SEWAGE SPILL THIS -- RIGHT BEFORE SPRING. I KEEP TALKING ABOUT -- OH, THERE WAS ANOTHER THING, ON EASY STREET. I HAVE -- WE REPLACED SEWERS ON EASY STREET A FEW YEARS AGO. NOW THE DRAIN TILES STARTING TO SINK. WE HAD SEWAGE PROBLEMS. WE MENTIONED ALL OF THIS. I HAVE LIVED THROUGH ASHLEY NEWS HOLE, AND THE GEORGETOWN DEBACLE AND I IN MY HEART OF HEARTS, I'M SO AFRAID THIS WILL BE ANOTHER DEBACLE. THERE ARE SO MANY GREAT, GREAT IDEAS THAT ARE OUT THERE THAT WE CAN SUPPORT AN EXTENSION OF COBBLESTONE, SOMETHING, ANYTHING. I THINK THIS PARTICULAR PLAN IS JUST NOT FIT FOR THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND FOR THE RESIDENTS AND FOR OUR CITY. AND THAT'S ALL I'M GOING TO SAY AT THIS POINT. THANK YOU. [ APPLAUSE ]
01:18:55.316: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
01:18:57.852: >> I'M GOING TO PLAY DEVIL'S ADVOCATE. THE CITY, IN MY -- THE CITY, IN MY OPINION, THERE'S NOT ENOUGH SUPPLY. AND WE NEED DID, WE NEED MORE SUPPLY IN THE CITY FOR HOUSES OF VARIOUS TYPES. AND BY ADDING THAT SUPPLY, IT WILL MAKE THINGS MORE AFFORDABLE FOR THE CITY AS A WHOLE. SOME OF YOU WILL ARGUE THAT YOU DON'T WANT THIS BUILT BECAUSE OF THE ENVIRONMENT, BECAUSE OF CLIMATE CHANGE. I HEARD THAT LAST NIGHT FROM BANNISTER. AND YET, THE SAME PEOPLE WHO SOMETIMES ARGUE THAT, YOU KNOW, IT'S ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE -- I REMEMBER WE HAD VOTES WHERE YOU HAD A CHANCE TO VOTE ON GETTING MONEY FOR CLIMATE CHANGE ACTIVITIES AND YOU VOTED AGAINST IT. LAST NIGHT COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD, YOU MADE THE STATEMENT THAT YOU BELIEVE IN HIGH DENSITY DOWNTOWN, AND YET YOU VOTED AGAINST CORE. AND SO I SEE THESE CONTRADICTIONS WHERE YOU SAY THINGS FOR ONE THING AND YOU SAY THINGS FOR ANOTHER THING. [ OFF MICROPHONE COMMENTS ]
01:19:56.477: >> IT WAS SOMEWHERE. ANYWAY, IT'S JUST -- I SEE DEVELOPERS, THEY TRY TO MAKE SOMETHING AND THEN PEOPLE COMPLAIN AS THEY SHOULD, AND THEN I SEE THEM MAKING CHANGES AND COMPROMISING AND I SEE PEOPLE KEEPING CONSTANTLY FIGHTING AGAINST DEVELOPERS AND IT MAKES IT HARDER AND HARDER AND HARDER. THERE'S NOT ONE EASY PLACE IN ANN ARBOR TO BUILD ANYMORE AND YOU HAVE TO MAKE THESE HARD DECISIONS. AND IT IS A FIDUCIARY DUTY IF THERE ARE LAWSUITS AND STUFF AT STAKE. THAT IS A FIDUCIARY DUTY. IT HAS TO COME FROM EVERY SINGLE WARD. EVERYONE WILL HAVE TO MAKE SACRIFICES. ANYWAY, THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO SAY. HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.
01:20:46.694: >> MY NAME IS JOHN GIBNEY, I'M FROM 2720 CRANBROOK. I HAVE LISTENED TO ALL OF MY FRIENDS, ALL THE PEOPLE I MET. THE GREATEST THING ABOUT THIS PROCESS TO ME IS I HAVE MET PEOPLE. I MET MY NEIGHBORS. I TALKED TO MY NEIGHBORS. THE THING I REALLY WANT TO TELL ABOUT YOU CHRIS, ONE DAY HE GAME THROUGH. HE WANTED TO TALK ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. AND I SAID THE ORANGEBURG TILE. AND GUESS WHAT IT, A LOT OF IT HAS BEEN CHANGED. IT DIDN'T HELP ME BECAUSE I PAID $10,000 TO GET IT FIXED. EVERY DAY I WALK BY THIS PARTICULAR PIECE OF PROPERTY, EVERY DAY I HAVE SEEN THIS PROPERTY. I HAVE TAKEN PIECES OF POISON IVY AND USED THEM FOR MY ECOLOGY CLASSES. I HAVE TAKEN PICTURES OF THE DEER WALKING THROUGH IN THE SNOW. IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT, YEAH, I DIDN'T OWN THE PROPERTY, BUT IT WAS SPIRITUALLY PART OF MY NEIGHBORHOOD. AND I THINK THE GREATEST THING ABOUT THIS IS THAT WE HAVE COME TOGETHER TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT YOU AND SAY, GUYS, WHY CHANGE THIS? WE CAN DO OTHER THINGS. NOW I'M AN HISTORIC PRESERVATIONIST BY TRADE, AND WE SAVED GORDON HALL AND ALSO ONE OF THE CIVIL WAR PARTNERS FOR THE STATE OF MICHIGAN. THE GREATEST AND THE BIGGEST THING THAT WAS DONE WAS SAVING GORDON HALL. THE WHOLE STATE OF MICHIGAN. NOW, THEY WERE TOLD THEY COULDN'T RAISE THE MONEY. THEY WERE TOLD THEY COULDN'T DO THAT AND I'M VERY PROUD OF THE FACT THAT ONE OF MY FORMER STUDENTS SPEARHEADED THAT. AND NOW INSTEAD OF DRIVING BY AND HAVING 500 STUPID HOUSES, YOU HAVE GORDON HALL UP THERE LOOKING DOWN ON YOU. EVERY DAY I GO TO WORK -- AND YOU CAN SEE I'M ON MY WAY TO WORK. I HAVE TO PASS BY AND WATCH ALL THE CARS THAT CAUSE MORE POLLUTION AND MORE PROBLEMS. YOU KNOW, THERE ARE PLACES YOU CAN GO. THIS IS NOT REALLY A MIDDLE-CLASS NEIGHBORHOOD. IT IS A LOWER-CLASS NEIGHBORHOOD. WE ARE GOING DOWN. I HAVE BEEN THERE FOR 25 YEARS. I CAME THERE FROM UNIVERSITY TOWN HOUSES. SO YOU KNOW WHERE I'M FROM. AND I HAVE A LOT OF FRIENDS FROM UNIVERSITY TOWN HOUSES THAT MOVED THERE. IT'S THE OWN PLACE THEY COULD GO AND I KNOW THAT ALL OF YOU HAVE SUPPORTED MAKING SURE WE HAVE CO-OPS AND OTHER THINGS FOR PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO DO. THIS ONE SPOT IS A REFUGE FOR US. IT IS A SPOT THAT CONNECTS BROWN PARK, MARYBETH DOYLE PARK, AND IT CONNECTS BURR PARK AND IT CONNECTS COUNTY FARM PARK. SOME OF YOU MAY NOT LIKE THE IDEA THAT WE HAVE SO MANY DEER. I DON'T PARTICULARLY LIKE IT BECAUSE I KNOW IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS, I WILL BE SEEING THEM RUNNING ACROSS PACKARD ON MY WAY HOME, BUT THAT'S PART OF THE ENVIRONMENT. I HAVE MONARCH BUTTERFLIES NOW. I HAVE BIRDS THAT I COULDN'T EVEN IMAGINE WHEN I MOVED IN. WHEN I MOVED IN, IT WAS STERILE. NOW IT'S BECOMING SOMETHING SPECIAL. SO THANK YOU. [ APPLAUSE ]
01:23:51.812: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS --
01:23:58.485: >> NO. WE'RE NOT DONE YET.
01:24:00.788: >> Mayor Taylor: IT'S QUITE ALL RIGHT.
01:24:01.655: >> GOOD EVENING, MAYOR AND CITY COUNCILMEMBERS. I WROTE AN EMAIL TO ALL OF YOU, BUT IN CASE YOU DIDN'T GET IT, I'M GOING TO REPEAT WHAT I SAID AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU HEAR IT. IF I DIDN'T SAY IT THE FIRST TIME, WENDY BAKER, 2306 EASY STREET. I WAS BORN IN ANN ARBOR. I GREW UP ON EASY STREET. 60 YEARS. MY DAD WORKED FOR THE ANN ARBOR NEWS FOR 40 YEARS. I WENT TO STONE SCHOOL. I WENT TO ALLEN SCHOOL. I WENT TO TAPPAN, I WENT TO HURON. THEN I CLEARED OUT OF ANN ARBOR, MOVED TO NEW YORK CITY. I WAS IN BOOK PUBLISHING FOR 12 YEARS IN THE GREATER NEW YORK METROPOLITAN AREA. AND THEN OFF TO THE WEST COAST. AND I LIVED IN THE GREATER LOS ANGELES AREA FOR 25 YEARS WORKING IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY. I RECENTLY INHERITED MY PARENT'S HOME ON EASY STREET AND I'M SO PLEASED TO BE BACK THERE, BECAUSE IT IS A GORGEOUS PLACE. AT FIRST ALL THAT OCCURRED TO ME, IT ONLY TAKES ME 20 MINUTES NOW TO GET ACROSS TOWN, INSTEAD OF TWO HOURS! BUT NOW I'M SEEING OTHER THINGS, LIKE ALL THE TRAFFIC. AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND MR. DEVIL'S ADVOCATE BACK THERE IN THE CORNER WHO DIDN'T GIVE US HIS NAME OR ADDRESS. WHY WE HAVE TO KEEP GROWING. WHY? WHY CAN'T WE JUST BE A FINITE PLACE? [ APPLAUSE ] AND KEEP IT BEAUTIFUL! OR PRETTY SOON, DETROIT IS GOING TO RUN INTO IPY IS AND IT WILL RUN INTO ANN ARBOR AND THEN IT WILL RUN INTO DEXTER AND THEN IT WILL RUN INTO CHELSEA AND IT'S GOING TO JUST BE LIKE NEW YORK AND L.A. AND IF THAT HAPPENS, WE HAVE YOU FOLKS TO THANK. SO THAT'S ALL.
01:26:00.674: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. [ APPLAUSE ]
01:26:05.045: >> MY NAME IS KATHY BORIS. I LIVE AT 1726 CHARLTON IN WARD 5. I THINK THIS MIGHT BE A GOOD MOMENT TO REMIND OURSELVES THAT ELECTIONS MATTER. SO AS YOU OBSERVE THE VOTES OF THE MAYOR AND THE CITY COUNCIL TONIGHT, THINK ABOUT WHO YOU WILL VOTE FOR IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU. [ APPLAUSE ]
01:26:28.135: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
01:26:39.079: >> HI, MY NAME IS MICHELE BARCUDE, I LIVE AT 2829 EASY STREET AND MY PROPERTY BACKS UP TO 2857 PACKARD ROAD. I DID SEND AN EMAIL, BUT THERE ARE JUST SOME THINGS I WILL REITERATE FROM WHAT I SENT AND I THINK YOU HAVE PROBABLY HEARD A LOT OF THESE CONCERNS ALREADY TONIGHT. BUT IN REVIEWING THE CODE OF ORDINANCES, IT EXPLICITLY STATES THAT A PUD WILL EXPAND THE SUPPLY OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IN OUR OPINION, OF PRICE POINT OF $450,000 IS NOT AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND I DON'T THINK THAT THE DEVELOPER HAS ANY INTENTION OF MAKING ANY OF THESE UNITS IN THAT REALM. ALSO IN THE CODE OF ORDINANCES, IT SAYS ANALYSIS IS DONE ON THE SURROUNDING NEIGHBORHOOD TO NEIGHBORHOODCONSIDER THE EXISTIG ARCHITECTURAL STYLE. AGAIN, IT DOES NOT SEEM THAT WHAT WE HAVE EXISTING IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD IS TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION IN THE NEW DEVELOPMENT. I THINK REALLY MOST IMPORTANTLY, IN THE PUD SECTION, F-7, IT STATES SAFE, CONVENIENT, UNCONGESTED AND WELL DEFINED VEHICULAR AND PEDESTRIAN CIRCULATION WITHIN AND TO THE DISTRICT SHALL BE PROVIDED AND WHERE FEASIBLE, THE PROPOSAL SHALL ENCOURAGE THE SUPPORT AND THE USE OF ALTERNATIVE METHODS OF TRANSPORTATION. SO I INVITE ALL OF YOU TO COME AND SIT AT THE INTERSECTION OF PACKARD AND EASY STREET DURING RUSH HOUR. [ APPLAUSE ] IT IS NEARLY IMPASSIBLE TO MACK TO MAKEA LEFT TURN ON PACKARD. AND WHEN PEOPLE BECOME THE AGITATED ENOUGH, THEY TURN ON EASY TO STREET TO CUT THROUGH TO PLATTE. I CAN ONLY IMAGINE THAT YOU KNOW THESE PEOPLE DO NOT GO 25 MILES PER HOUR. WE HAVE SEVERAL CHILDREN LIVING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD, MY SON INCLUDED AND IT'S JUST NOT SAFE. SO NOW ADD 52 MORE HOUSES OR UNITS TO THIS AREA, NO ADDITIONAL S STOP SIGNS OR STOP LIGHTS AND IMAGINE HOW MUCH WORSE THAT SITUATION WILL BE. ANOTHER CONCERN IS THAT A PUD DOES NOT HAVE DEFINED MINIMUMS AND MAXIMUMS, WHICH MUST BE STATED IN THE PROPOSED SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATION. WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF THE DEVELOPER WOULD MAKE CHANGES WITHOUT APPROVAL AFTER REZONING OR WILL HE BE HELD TO THE PROPOSED PLAN? DESPITE WHAT HAPPENS WITH THIS PROPERTY, WE WOULD ALSO LIKE YOU TO CONSIDER CHANGING R1B ZONING SO THAT IF WE THE EXISTING HOMEOWNERS WOULD LIKE TO ADD ON TO OUR PROPERTIES WE CAN DO SO IN THE FRONT AND NOT JUST OUT THE BACK BECAUSE IF IT GOES THROUGH, WE'LL HAVE TEASE TOWERING TWO-STORY HOMES THAT ARE GOING TO BE ONLY 20 FEET OFF OF OUR PROPERTY LINE. [ APPLAUSE ]
01:29:43.797: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
01:29:50.037: >> HI, MY NAME IS BETH COLLINS. I LIVE IN WARD 5 AND MY HUSBAND GREW UP ON EASY STREET. THE TREE ON THE CITY LOGO IS A BEAUTIFUL GREEN BURR OAK TREE. I WAS TOLD THAT THIS PROPERTY, EVERYTHING SOUTH OF ANN ARBOR WAS ALL FARM LAND. SO IT'S VERY RARE TO HAVE THIS TYPE OF AMOUNT OF TREES ALL IN ONE SPOT. THEY WILL BE REMOVING 57 LANDMARK TREES, 19 WILL BE SPARED, BUT MANY WILL HAVE THEIR CRITICAL ROOT ZONE AFFECTED. I'M HOPING THAT YOU WILL MAKE SOME ADDRESSING OF THAT. 208 WOODLAND TREES WILL BE REMOVED AND 74 SPARED. MAYBE SOME CHANGES NEED TO BE MADE IN OUR NATURAL FEATURES ORDINANCES. I HAVE SEEN A LACK OF CONCERN FOR FEATURES ON OTHER SITE PLANS ALSO, NOT ENOUGH PROTECTION FOR WETLANDS, TREES, STEEP SLOPES AND THE GLACIER-MADE LAKE. THERE IS A CLIMATE CRISIS. WE NEED TO CHANGE OUR THINKING ABOUT DEVELOPMENT IN AREAS THAT HAVE SUCH PRECIOUS NATURAL FEATURES. I DISAGREE THIS LAND IS NOT WANTED FOR A PARK OR EDUCATIONAL HISTORIC HOME. WE MUST SPEND THE GREEN BELT ALLOTTED FOR THE CITY. THERE'S A BALANCE OF OVER $6 MILLION AND IT'S CALLED AN OPEN SPACE AND PARKLAND PRESERVATION MILLAGE, WHICH IN MY MIND MEANS TO USE TO PRESERVE SPACE INSIDE THE CITY! WHICH IS TO PREVENT DEVELOPMENT INSIDE THE CITY. [ APPLAUSE ] I DO AGREE THAT WE NEED SOME DEVELOPMENT IN THE CITY. SO DEVIL'S ADVOCATE KAY. THE RESIDENTS DID APPROVE THE GREENBELT MILLAGE. I HOPE WE START LOOKING AT THIS MORE. ALSO ON THE PROS PLANS, 89% OF VOTERS THINK THAT PARKS ARE IMPORTANT. WE ALWAYS APPROVE PARK MILLAGE WHEN IT'S ON THE BALLOT AND THE OTHER 11% WILL SAY THERE'S TOO MANY PARKS OR THAT THEY DON'T WANT THIS LAND OR THAT LAND. THERE ARE WRONG. IT'S 11%. LISTEN TO THE REST OF US AND PLEASE REMEMBER THAT BEAUTIFUL LOGO THAT'S BEHIND YOU, MUCH MAYBE WE DON'T WANT TO MAKE THIS MISTAKE AGAIN. THANK YOU.
01:32:14.014: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
01:32:25.992: >> HI. SO KAREN WHITE, 2719 CRANBROOK. YOU KNOW ALL THE REASONS THAT I'M VERY OPPOSED TO THIS DEVELOPMENT. YOU HAVE HEARD ME SAY THEM ALL BEFORE. SO THIS TIME, I'M JUST GOING TO READ WHAT I WROTE. HANG ON, AT THIS POLITICAL AND IRON ENVIRONMENTAL TIPPING POINT, I FEEL THE NEED TO PARAPHRASE THE SENTIMENT THAT CAPTURES MY FRUSTRATION RIGHT NOW. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY SOMEONE WOULD GO THROUGH ALL THE TROUBLE OF RUNNING FOR COUNCIL OR MAYOR OF THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR JUST TO TELL US WHAT WE CAN'T DO AND WHAT YOU WON'T FIGHT FOR. PREDATORY DEVELOPMENTS LIKE THIS PUD PROFIT FROM OUR NEIGHBORHOODS WHILE KILLING THE QUALITIES THAT MAKE THEM LIVABLE IN THE FIRST PLACE. WORST OF ALL, THE SYSTEM, AS IT CURRENTLY STANDS MAKES CITIZENS BELIEVE THAT WE ARE POWERLESS, AND THAT THE ONLY PRUDENT RESPONSE IS TO TRY AND SALVAGE TINY VICTORIES AT THE EDGES. WE HAVE SEEN THIS MOVIE BEFORE. THIS IS NOT MR. HOUSELLERs' FIRST LAWSUIT AGAINST THE ACITY. YOU MAY REMEMBER THE EXPENSIVE CUL-DE-SAC AGAINST LIBERTY HEIGHTS WHERE SIDEWALKS ALLOW NEIGHBORS TO STROLL PAST ONE ANOTHER'S ENORMOUS TWO-CAR GARAGES AND THE LAYOUT ENCOURAGES RESIDENTS TO DRIVE IN, CLOSE THE DOORS BEHIND THEM AND NEVER LOOK BACK. THE ONLY VIEW OFFERED BY THE HEIGHTS IS THE SIGHT OF THE STAND PIPE IN THE CENTER OF THE REQUIRED RETENTION POND. THERE IS A DANGEROUS PROBLEM HERE. THE CITIZENS OF ANN ARBOR ARE LOSING FAITH IN HOW WE ADMINISTER DEVELOPMENT. THEY ARE LOSING FAITH IN THE POWER OF DEMOCRACY TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE AND PLACES THAT MAKE ANN ARBOR UNIQUE. THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY SOMEONE WOULD GO THROUGH ALL THE TROUBLE OF RUNNING FOR COUNCIL OR MAYOR OF THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR, ONLY TO TELL US WHAT WE CAN'T DO AND WHAT YOU WON'T FIGHT FOR. OUR LAST CITY COUNCIL MADE A MISTAKE WHEN THEY REZONED THIS PARCEL BASED ON A LITTLE MORE THAN THE DEVELOPER'S VAGUE DESCRIPTIONS OF WHAT HE MIGHT BUILD. I'M GRATEFUL THAT COUNCILMAN ACKERMAN VOTED AGAINST IT. HE SAW THAT THIS WAS A DANGEROUS LACK OF SPECIFICS. [ APPLAUSE ] NOW SOME OF YOU ARE ADVISING ME AND MY NEIGHBORS TO SIT DOWN. DON'T TAKE THE RISK OF LETTING THIS PROPERTY OWNER CUT DOWN ALL THE TREES OUT OF SPITE. DON'T TAKE THE RISK OF HAVING THIS RELATER PURCHASE THE PROPERTY AND THEN BUILD AT AN EVEN HIGHER DENSITY.
01:35:30.677: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. [ APPLAUSE ]
01:35:37.017: >> I'M KATHLEEN DOLE LAN FROM 2465 EASY STREET. I'M BEGGING YOU TO VOTE NO. IT'S A BAD PLAN. WARD 3 DOESN'T WANT IT. A MISTAKE WAS MADE BY THE PREVIOUS COUNCIL THREE YEARS AGO. AND I KNOW THAT IT MIGHT COST THE CITY. WITH THIS LAWSUIT. BUT THE COST OF MOVING FORWARD WITH THE PROJECT THAT SACRIFICES THE CHARACTER OF ONE OF THE FEW AFFORDABLE NEIGHBORHOODS, IT'S WALKABLE, IT'S CHARMING AND IT HAS NATURE, AND IT'S KEEPING ANN ARBOR WEIRD. ALONG WITH AN IRREPLACEABLE NATIVE PIECE OF FOREST, HISTORIC HOME, AND I DON'T SEE ANY BENEFIT IN THIS PUD. WE NEED TO STOP THIS TRAIN TO GAIN TIME TO COME TOGETHER WITH ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS, CREATE A VISION AND PLAN THAT ACTUALLY REFLECTS WHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE VALUE AND WHAT WE WANT. I'M COUNTING ON ZACK AND JULIE TO STAND WITH WARD 3 ON THIS. DENSITY SEEMS TO BE THE MONDAY MANTRA,AND IT'S MEANINGLESS WITE PROPER CONTEXT. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT DENSE DENS. DENSITY SUPPOSEDLY LEADS TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING. TO BUILD HOMES IN $400,000 HOME, IN A NEIGHBORHOOD OF $200,000, THAT EQUALS GENTRIFICATION, NOT AFFORDABILITY. [ APPLAUSE ] AND FOR DENSITY TO ENABLE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION THESE SAME PEOPLE LIVING IN $400,000 HOUSES AIN'T GOING TO BE WAITING ON PACKAGE FOR A BUS AND NOR WILL ANN ARBOR EVER BE A CITY LARGE ENOUGH TO SUPPORT A TRUE CAR-FREE EXISTENCE. THAT'S RIDICULOUS. I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT THE ARGUMENT OF WHY DOES IT NEED TO GROW, GROW, GROW. CAN IT CONTINUE TO BE WHAT IT IS? THAT AH'S NOT WHAT WE WANT. WE ARE COUNTING ON YOU TO MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICE.
01:38:02.095: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
01:38:13.206: >> GOOD EVENING. MY NAME IS PETE BENSON. I'M FROM 2810 EASY STREET. I REALLY HAD NO INTENTION OF SPEAKING TONIGHT. BUT I DO WANT TO REITERATE SOME OF THE THINGS MY NEIGHBORS HAVE SAID THAT I UNDERSTAND THE CITY HAS AN ISSUE WITH THE TAX BASE POTENTIALLY AND THEY WANT TO INCREASE PROPERTIES THAT WILL GENERATE TAXES WHERE THE UNIVERSITY CONTINUES TO GOBBLE UP LAND. I WOULD SAY THIS AREA DOES HAVE STORMWATER ISSUES AND THAT NEEDS TO BE THOUGHT ABOUT. I MEAN, I'M A PROPONENT OF NEW URBANISM, BUT I AGREE WITH THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER, WHAT SHE SAID. IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE THE RIGHT CONTEXT FOR SOMETHING LIKE NEW URBANISM. WE DON'T -- THERE'S NOT THE SERVICES IN PLACE. MY QUESTION, HAS THERE BEEN A TRAFFIC STUDY THAT'S BEEN DONE IN THIS AREA OR HAS THERE BEEN AN IMPACT STUDY ON THIS MR. MAYOR? THERE HAS? AND WELL, YOU KNOW, IF THAT'S TRUE, YOU GUYS HAVE NOT DONE A GREAT JOB OF MARKETING THIS TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD ON ONE -- HAVE YOU NOT PROVIDED THE CONTEXT OF WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO DO, WHAT THE LAND USE PLAN FOR THE CITY IS. IT LACKS THE CONTEXT AND MAYBE YOU WOULD GET MORE BUY-IN IF THERE WAS A BETTER JOB OF MARKETING IT. AGAIN, IF THIS PIECE OF PROPERTY, WITHIN THE CITY IS NOT WORTH FIGHTING FOR, I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS. HOW MANY OTHER NATURAL AREAS WITHIN THE CITY CONTEXT HAS THIS KIND OF NATURAL FEATURES LEFT TO IT/AG. AGAIN, MALLET CREEK HAS STORMWATER ISSUES THAT ARE WELL DOCUMENTED. IT IS ONE OF THE SEMINOLE POINTS FOR ME, IT'S ALMOST LAUGHABLE THAT SOMEONE WANTS TO COME IN AND BRING IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE AREA THAT IS THE LAST BIT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE CITY. AND $400,00 $400,000 DOES NOT RY SEEM LIKE AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO ME. THANK YOU.
01:40:10.890: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. [ APPLAUSE ]
01:40:21.267: >> I HAD, I'M RITA MITCHELL, I LIVE ON 5th STREET. I WANT TO REMIND COUNCIL OF THE COUNCIL SEATED IN NOVEMBER OF 2017, THAT VOTED DOWN THIS PROJECT, I BELIEVE LARGELY BECAUSE OF THE NATURAL FEATURES ON THIS SITE, THAT ARE IRREPLACEABLE. IN OUR LIFETIMES, WE WILL NEVER SEE THE KIND OF TREES THAT ARE PRESENT ON THIS SITE. AND HAVE YOU PROBABLY HEARD IN OUR CURRENT ERA OF CURRENT WITH CLIMATE THAT TREES ARE THE LUNGS OF THE PLANET. WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SAVE THESE TREES AND SAVE A SMALL SPACE IN THE CENTER OF ANN ARBOR THAT ACTUALLY PROVIDES A SERVICE, A GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICE, THAT WOULD BE VERY HARD TO REPLACE AND IS PROBABLY ALREADY PROTECTING THIS NEIGHBORHOOD TO SOME EXTENT, GIVEN WHAT I HEARD ABOUT THE KINDS OF PROBLEMS WITH FLOODING AND ALL IN THE AREA. THOSE TREES ARE ABSORBING WATER, THEY ARE FILTERING THE AREA. THEY ARE PROVIDING THE GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE CAN'T REPLACE ARTIFICIALLY. IT WON'T HAPPEN. AND, IN FACT, MANY OF THE TREES THAT EVEN WHICH MAY REMAIN WILL PROBABLY DIE IF THIS IS DEVELOPED BECAUSE OF INCURSIONS ON CRITICAL ROOT ZONES AND BECAUSE OF COMP COMPACTION DURIG CONSTRUCTION. THAT TYPE OF THING IS A BIG LOSS. I URGE YOU TO NOT DO DEGREENFIELD DEVELOPMENT. THAT'S WHAT IT IS. IT'S LIKE GOING INTO A FARM FIELD AND PUTTING IN THE SEWERS, THE LIGHTS, THE WHATEVER. AND DEVELOP THINGS THAT ARE NOT THIS NOW FROM A HUMAN CONSTRUCTION PERSPECTIVE. BUT THEY ARE THERE IN THE NATURAL WORLD. AND SO I WOULD LIKE YOU TO RESPECT THAT, AND HOLD WITH YOUR ORIGINAL DECISION. THANK YOU. [ APPLAUSE ]
01:42:11.010: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
01:42:19.252: >> MY NAME IS MARY M. BENSON AND I LIVE AT 2810 EASY STREET. I'M GOING TO READ WHAT I WROTE. WHAT I WANTED TO SHARE WITH YOU. I DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW SO MUCH NEW DEVELOPMENT CAN BE OCCURRING IN A RELATIVELY CONDENSED AREA OF THE CITY. THIS IS NOT ONE DEVELOPMENT, BUT ONE OF THREE NEW DEVELOPMENTS THAT ARE MOVING FORWARD RIGHT NOW ALL WITHIN A FEW MILES OF EACH OTHER. ALL OF THIS PUSH FOR HIGH DENSITY IS AT A HIGH COST FOR THE RESIDENTS WHO HAVE INVESTED THEIR LIVES HERE. THREE NEW DEVELOPMENTS NEAR PACKARD AND PL PLATTE WHICH OF COURSE IS ONE OF ANN ARBOR'S LOWER INCOME AREAS WILL INCREASE NOISE POLLUTION, LIGHT POLLUTION, AIR POLLUTION AND TRAFFIC CONGESTION. NONE OF WHICH ARE INSIGNIFICANT IN THE EFFECTS THAT THEY HAVE ON HEALTH -- ON THE HEALTH AND THE MENTAL WELL-BEING OF THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE AND WORK IN THE AREA. WHEN ALL THREE ARE COMPLETED AND EVERYONE HAS MADE THEIR MONEY FROM THEM, WE ARE GOING TO BE LEFT WITH ALL OF THESE TRAILS TS THAT REDUCE THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR RESIDENTS ON THIS SIDE OF TOWN. IN ADDITION, THE TRAFFIC PROBLEMS INEVITABLE WILL LIKELY HURT THE BUSINESSES THAT HAVE MADE A COMMITMENT TO BE HERE. IF THE CITY HAS ANY POSSIBLE WAY TO BUY THIS LAND THROUGH THE GREENBELT FUNDS OR ANY OTHER MEANS, I URGE YOU TO CONSIDER IT. AT VERY LEAST, SLOW DOWN THE APPROVALS FOR THIS SITE. THE OTHER TWO DEVELOPMENTS ARE ALREADY LEVEL, BUT THIS LAND IS STILL RICH WITH NATURE AND HISTORY AND CAN BE UTILIZED BY THE CITY AS A REVENUE SOURCE, AS A RENTAL FACILITY, SIMILAR TO COBBLESTONE FARM. THAT SITE IS SO POPULAR, THAT PEOPLE ARE TURNED AWAY BECAUSE THEY BOOK OUT YEARS IN ADVANCE. SO THERE'S CLEARLY A NICHE TO FILL. IN ADDITION, THE SITE COULD BE SUIT LISEED FOR EDUCATION PROGRAMS, SIMILAR TO THE LESLIE SCIENCE CENTER. WHICH WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING LIKE THAT ON OUR SIDE OF TOWN. THOSE ARE JUST TWO IDEAS TO MAKE IT VIABLE FOR THE CITY TO CONSIDER PURCHASING THE LAND. IT WOULD BE A LONG TERM VISION BUT WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY BENEFIT OUR CITY. THANK YOU.
01:44:44.197: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
01:44:53.439: >> OH, GOODNESS. HELLO, Y'ALL. MY NAME IS DAN BILLICH, I LIVE AT 2719 CRANBROOK ROAD. IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT WARD THREE. IT'S ABOUT THE WHOLE CITY. SOMEONE MENTIONED GREENBELT AND I WANT TO SAY GREENBELT! AND THEN I WANT TO MENTION MY WIFE KAREN WHITE WHO ROSE TO SPEAK A WHILE AGO. I'M SO PROUD OF HER. LET ME BRAG ON CA KAREN A LITTLE BIT. KAREN GREW UP ON A FARM NEAR SAGINAW. SHE TYPICALLY DOES NOT TRADE ON HER ACADEMIC CREDENTIALS BUT I CAN LET YOU KNOW THAT SHE HAS DEGREED ON AMERICAN CULTURE AND FROM JAIL, AND UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN. SHE SPENDS MANY OF HER DAYS IN THE STACKS THE BENTLEY HISTORICAL LIBRARY. WHEN IT COMES TO AMERICAN ART HISTORY, CULTURE AND ARE ARARCHITECTURE, SHE KNOWS WHAT SHE'S TALKING ABOUT. SHE'S NOT BLOWING SMOKE ABOUT THE FARMHOUSE AT 2857 PACKARD. AS FOR ME WHEN THE CITY IS CONFRONTED WITH DEMANDS FROM A LITIGIOUS. THAT IS UNREASONABLY PRONE TO GO TO LAW TO SETTLE DISPUTES. LITIGIOUS. CARTOON VILLAIN, DEVELOPER, WHICH IS HOW IT FEELS. IT TENDS TO DRAW ALL OF US CONCERNED CITIZENS INTO THE CARTOON PLOT. AFTER ALL, IF THERE'S A CARTOON VILLAIN DEVELOPER, THEN WE NEED SOME CARTOON NIMBY BLEEDING HEARTS TO BALANCE THE STORY. LET ME BE CLEAR, KAREN AND I AND I THINK THE NEIGHBORS WHO HAVE SPOKEN ALSO TONIGHT ARE NOT AGAINST DEVELOPMENT, ANY DEVELOPMENT AT 2857 PACKARD. WE ARE AGAINST STUPID DEVELOPMENT. PAUSE. AS I UNDERSTAND IT, THE PLAN UNIT DEVELOPMENT IS SUPPOSED TO OFFER A CLEAR AND UNAMBIGUOUS BENEFIT TO THE CITY. THIS PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT IS IRRESPONSIBLE ABOUT THE TRAFFIC PROBLEMS THAT EXIST AND THAT IT WILL COMPLICATE. THAT WE ARE ALL DEAL WITH EVERY DAY. THE DEVELOPMENT -- THE PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT IS CAVALIER ABOUT CUTTING IRREPLACEABLE TREES. THE PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT IS BLOATED, PACKED SHOULDER TO SHOULDER. THE PROPOSED HOUSING THAT IS WAY OUT OF CHARACTER WITH THE SURROUNDING NEIGHBORHOOD. AND NOT LEASED, THIS PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT IS -- IT'S CONTEMPTUOUS OF ANN ARBOR HISTORY, OUR PAST AND OUR FUTURE. AND IT'S LOOKED THE OTHER WAY ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE HISTORIC 1850 GREEK REVIVAL FARMHOUSE ON THE SITE, A HOUSE THAT IT PROPOSES TO RAZE. THANK Y'ALL.
01:48:00.993: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
01:48:11.570: >> GOOD EVENING, I'M ELLEN RAMSBY. I DON'T THINK THAT I CAN ADD GREATLY TO THE ELOQUENCE AND THE VERY REAL CONCERNS THAT THE NEIGHBORS HAVE. THEY HAVE EXPRESSED THEMSELVES BEAUTIFULLY AND I HOPE THAT YOU ARE HEARING THEM. I DO WANT TO SPEAK THROUGHOUT SPEAKER -- TO THE HISTORIC NATURE OF THIS PLACE. THE MALIKS CREEK SETTLEMENT DATES FROM 1824, OR A LITTLE BIT BEFORE THAT ANN ARBOR WAS FORMED. SO THE COBBLESTONE FARM HOUSES, THE SAME AGE AS THE GREEK REVIVAL FARM HOUSE ON THIS PROPERTY. NOT ONLY DO YOU HAVE HISTORIC TREES, BUT YOU HAVE THE BEGINNINGS OF THE VERY FIRST SETTLEMENTS IN WASHTENAW COUNTY. TO THINK THAT YOU COULD SAVE NOT ONLY THE LANDSCAPE, BUT THAT YOU COULD SAVE THE REMNANTS OF THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT FROM THIS VERY -- WITH A LITTLE CREATIVITY ON THE PART OF THE CITY, THE OWNER OF THE PROPERTY, AND PERHAPS THE DEVELOPER, THAT YOU COULD GET OUTSIDE THE BOX, THAT YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO ACCEPT A DEVELOPMENT THAT REALLY ERADICATES THE HISTORY, THE TREES AND THE NATURAL AREAS AND THE CONTEXT OF THIS NEIGHBORHOOD, THAT YOU COULD JUST STEP BACK AND CREATE SOMETHING OF VALUE THAT WOULD LAST AS LONG AS THIS PIECE OF PROPERTY HAS ALREADY LASTED IN OUR HISTORY, WHICH IS, WHAT, I CAN'T DO THE MATH. SO CLOSE ON 200 YEARS. I HOPE YOU JUST CONSIDER THE HISTORY, THE LAND SCAPE, THE ENVIRONMENT, THE NEIGHBORHOOD, AND REALLY, REALLY GIVE THIS A SECOND THOUGHT. THANK YOU. [ APPLAUSE ]
01:50:15.194: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING?
01:50:27.072: >> JIM HEISLER, PETITIONER AND THE DEVELOPER, THE PROPOSED DEVELOPER FOR THE PROPERTY THAT WE'RE IN QUESTION TONIGHT, WITH ME IS TYLER SMITH, THE ENGINEER. I'M NOT GOING TO REHASH ALL THE DIFFERENT INFORMATION IN FRONT OF YOU. THE STAFF HAS DONE A VERY COMPLETE JOB OF GIVING YOU ALL THE INFORMATION. BUT A FEW OF THE FACTS, I WOULD LIKE TO REITERATE HERE THAT YOU HAVE COMPETENT STAFF THAT YOU RELY ON TO LOOK AT TRAFFIC, SEWER, WATER, STORMWATER, DRAINAGE, ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE ORDINANCES THAT YOU WROTE, AND WE'RE HERE FOR THIS PUD AT YOUR REQUEST, GIVEN WHAT HAPPENED ON THE OTHER ONE, WHICH WE WERE REQUESTED TO COME UP WITH A BETTER PLAN THAN WAS PROPOSED, THE ONE THAT WAS TURNED DOWN AND THROUGH ABOUT A YEAR PROCESS WE HAVE DONE THAT, WE FEEL. AND THEN WHEN WE WERE AT THE LAST MEETING, THERE WERE SOME QUESTIONS THAT CAME UP AND IN THE DOCUMENTS BEFORE YOU TONIGHT IN THE DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE HOUSE. PEOPLE CALL IT HIS TORIC, IT'S OLD. IT IS NOT ON HISTORIC REGISTER OR ANY OTHER THING BEFORE NOW. I'M JUST STATING THE FACTS. AND IF WE WOULD ALLOW THE CITY TIME TO EVAL WET, LOOK, MOVE IT, DO WHATEVER THEY WANT, WE HAVE AGREED TO THAT. THIS IS APPROVED FOR PRETTY MUCH FOR SIX MONTHS. ALSO SOME OF THE TREES AND THE HISTORIC NATURE OF THE ENVIRONMENT AROUND THERE, ALL THE VEGETATION THAT YOUR NATURAL AREA PRESERVATION, PLAN, AND COMMITTEE HAVE COME UP WITH DIFFERENT WAY WE COULD DO THAT AND WE HAVE AGREED THAT, YOU KNOW, IF IT GETS SPREAD AROUND THE CITY, HOWEVER THEY DO AND WE HAVE AGREED NOT JUST FOR THE FIVE YEARS BUT TO DO IT IN PERPETUITY, THERE WERE SOME OTHER THINGS ABOUT SUSTAINABILITY, THE HOUSE, THE ORIENTATION OF THE ROOFS. WE CAN WORK WITHIN THE ELEVATIONS WE GAVE YOU, TO ALOSING FAITH YOU -- THERE WOULD BE THE ABILITY TO PUT SOLAR PANELS ON THERE, AND THE WAYS THAT ARE PRACTICAL AT THIS TAMEE AND ALSO THE OPTION FOR ELECTRICAL SERVICE, IF PEOPLE DECIDE TO GO ALL ELECTRIC IN THE FUTURE THAT WE CAN A/ ACCOMMODAE THAT AND WILL BE WRITTEN IN THE DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT. I WANTED TO HIT THE ONES -- WE LISTENED TO YOUR COMMENTS LAST TIME AND WE TRIED TO ACCOMMODATE THOSE. WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME.
01:53:18.110: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU S. .IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WOULD WOUD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING? SEEING NO ONE, THIS PUBLIC HEARING IS CLOSED. PUBLIC HEARING NUMBER FOUR. RESOLUTION TO APPROVE WEBER PUD SITE PLAN AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT, 2857 PACKARD ROAD. IS THERE ANYONE WOULD WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC -- WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING.
01:53:41.967: >> RON LEV, 2645 EASY STREET. I WOULD LIKE TO REITERATE THAT I BELIEVE THE SENTIMENT IS NOT TO VOTE AGAINST THE PUD IN AND OF ITSELF. IT'S NOT -- IT'S NOT JUST TO VOTE AGAINST THE PUD, TO NEGOTIATE SLIGHTLY PER TERMS WITH THE DEVELOPER. TO SUBSTIT SCUTTLE THE PLAN, EVA COST TO THE CITY TO COME UP WITH A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT MAN AND MORE APPROPRIATE USE FOR THIS LAND. [ APPLAUSE ]
01:54:16.568: >> I WOULD JUST LIKE TO REITERATE SOMETHING I DIDN'T SAY THE FIRST TIME, WHICH IS A CASE EXAMPLE IN TERMS OF THE AFFORDABILITY ISSUE, I WILL OFFER MY GEN XY FRIENDS FROM WISCONSIN, THEY WORK IN THE MUSEUM STUDIES FEELS AND THEY JUST BOUGHT A HOME IN CLAYTON, MICHIGAN. DO YOU KNOW WHY? IT'S NOT AFFORDABLE HERE. AND QUITE FRANKLY, THIS IDEA THAT TO STACK THIS DENSITY UP HERE IN THE NAME OF GREENNESS IS A BIT OF GREEN WASHING, BECAUSE YOU KNOW AS MY NEIGHBORS HAVE ALREADY POINTED OUT, THEY WILL BE DRIVING CARS. THEY ARE NOT GOING TO BE TAKING THE FIVE BUS LINE WHICH TAKES, WHAT, 45 MINUTES TO GET DOWNTOWN AS IT IS, ANYWAY, THIS IS PREPOSTEROUS. ANYWAY, I BESEECH YOU TO CONSIDER THE HUMAN BEINGS, THE ACTUAL HUMAN BEINGS WHO HAVE TO LIVE WITH US, TO TAKE YOURSELF OUT OF BURNS PARK, PERHAPS, BECAUSE I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT ONE OF MY WARD REPRESENTATIVES IS ACTUALLY MY REPRESENTATIVE. BUT IT'S -- IT'S ANATHAMA TO THE ENTIRE -- YOU KNOW, HOW ANN ARBOR PURPORTS ITSELF TO BE. THIS IS A TRAGEDY IF YOU LET THIS FLY ON YOUR WATCH. AND IT WILL BE. WE VOTE REGULARLY, AND OFTEN. SO DO THE RIGHT THING. PLEASE. THANK YOU.
01:55:52.064: >> Mayor Taylor: IF I CAN JUST REQUEST THAT PEOPLE SPEAK TO THE SITE PLAN. THIS IS THE SUBJECT OF THE PUBLIC HEARING, SITE PLAN.
01:56:02.341: >> SO THE SITE PLAN, AS PRESENTING PRESENTED IN THE PUD, IS BASED IN SOME MANNER, I THINK WE ALL HAVE TO UNDERSTAND ON A LAWSUIT THAT'S BEING THREATENED AGAINST THE CITY, AND THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SOME NEGOTIATIONS SO THAT WE WOULD COME UP WITH THIS PARTICULAR PUD. I THINK THE MISTAKE THAT WAS MADE IN 2016, REGARDING THE AREA PLAN, THERE WAS DISCUSSION AT THAT TIME BY THE DEVELOPER, THAT THIS PROPERTY WAS ON A BUS LINE, THAT THERE WOULD BE POSSIBILITY. I THOUGHT THAT THERE WAS QUITE A BIT OF DISCUSSION THAT THERE WOULD BE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. UNFORTUNATELY, THAT HASN'T TAKEN PLACE. MANY OF THE THINGS THAT WERE PRESENTED AT THE TIME OF THE CHANGE TO R1E, SIMPLY HAVE NOT BEEN FOLLOWED THROUGH ON. BUT YOU NOW HAVE A LAWSUIT THAT YOU ARE FACING THAT MAINTAINS THAT YOU APPROVED -- WHEN YOU APPROVED THE R1E, THAT YOU APPROVED 51 HOUSING UNITS. YES, IT'S -- IT'S TRUE, THAT TECHNICALLY, I UNDERSTAND FROM A LEGAL POINT OF VIEW, YOU ARE UP AGAINST A VERY DIFFICULT SITUATION. HOWEVER, I THINK AS OTHER PEOPLE HAVE SAID, THE PRESENT PUD DOESN'T SHOW ANY PARTICULAR IMPROVEMENTS. IT DOESN'T -- THIS DOESN'T FIT WHAT THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR PRESENTS AS FAR AS HOW A PUD SHOULD BE ANALYZED. THANK YOU.
01:58:02.394: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
01:58:10.736: >> HI, KAREN WHITE AGAIN. I'M SORRY TO BE SO FRAUGHT, SO EMOTIONAL ABOUT THIS. THIS IS MY NEIGHBORHOOD. THIS IS MY FAMILY. DENSITY. I'M SO SORRY, MS. GRAND HAD TO STEP AWAY AT THIS POINT. BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN TOLD REPEATEDLY, THAT SOMEHOW DENSITY IS THE MAGIC BULLET THAT WILL SOLVE AFFORDABILITY PROBLEMS IN THIS CITY. THAT IS NOT TRUE! DENSITY DOES NOT ADDRESS ENVIRONMENTAL OR SOCIAL JUSTICE CONCERNS. THAT ARE TOTALLY WRAPPED UP IN AFFORDABILITY ISSUES. YOU CAN MAKE THIS YOUR OWN PRIVATE HELLISH VERSION OF MANHATTAN OR SAN FRANCISCO, AND YOU WILL STILL HAVE AFFORDABILITY PROBLEMS. DON'T SACRIFICE MY FAMILY, MY NEIGHBORHOOD, AND THE NATURE THAT WE CURRENTLY ENJOY, CHASING SOME MYTHICAL BELIEF THAT DENSITY IS GOING TO FIX EVERYTHING. PLEASE STEP BACK FROM THIS SITE PLAN. IT IS TOO DENSE! PLEASE PUT IT ON HOLD, RECONVENE ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS, COME UP WITH CREATIVE. DO SOME HARD WORK HERE! WORK WITH THE RESIDENTS TO MAKE THIS GOOD. YOU CAN MAKE THIS FANTASTIC! IT WILL NO LONGER BE FAST OR CHEAP. WE LOST THOSE OPPORTUNITIES, BUT IT CAN BE FANTASTIC! THANK YOU.
02:00:09.955: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
02:00:18.330: >> WE TALKED ABOUT PROCESS IN MY FIRST PUBLIC COMMENTARY. GOING TO THE ISSUE OF PUD AT THE HAND, I JUST WANT TO GIVE THIS ANALYSIS. AND, AGAIN, SPEAKING FROM MY ON THE OTHER HAND EXPERIENCE AS A FORMER MEMBER OF THE PLANNING COMMISSION. I'M GOING TO ASK YOU, AS OTHERS HAVE SAID, WHAT IS THE GREAT VALUE THAT YOU ARE GETTING OUT OF THE PUD? WHAT IS -- YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE LOSS OF A MAJOR TREE GROVE, WITH MANY LANDMARK TREES BEING DESTROYED OR CURRICULAR ROOTS BEING AFFECTED, WOODLAND TREES. THEY HAVE A TREMENDOUS VALUE, BOTH AESTHETICALLY AND FOR THE CLIMATE. SO THE QUESTION TO BE ASKED IS, AT HAND, WHAT IS THE PUBLIC BENEFIT WE ARE GETTING FOR THIS TRADEOFF. IF TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN TO HAVE SUCH A SACRIFICE, IT HAS TO BE REALLY HUGE AND WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO MR. POTINEN, JUST INTRINSICALLY BUILDING HOMES IS NOT A VALUE. WHAT WE HAVE OFFICIALLY HERE IS JUST MERELY A FEW TREES THAT MAY BE PROTECTED BUT LIKELY MANY MORE WILL BE LOST IN THIS DESTRUCTION, AND THE COMPANIONS BEING LOST BECAUSE THEY RELATE TO ONE ANOTHER. SO WE REALLY DON'T GET MUCH OF A TRADEOFF IN TERMS OF THE PUD. THERE'S NO PROVISION UNDER THE CITY'S PLAN FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. MANY OF YOU KNOW AND I HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE WITH THEM, WHEN I -- ON THE SIERRA CLUB BOARD, WITH MR. MATT GROCOFF WHO HAS BEEN AN ADVOCATE. A PROVISION TO PUT SOLAR PANELS ON THE ROOF, I'M NOT SEEING THAT THE HOMES ARE ALL ELECTRIC RIGHT NOW. THERE'S NO PUBLIC BENEFIT. SO WHERE IS THE PUBLIC BENEFIT IN THAT. AS WE MOVE FORWARD TO DRESS THE CLIMATE CRISIS. I'M JUST GIVING SOME EXAMPLES. I REALIZED SOME ISSUES REGARDING THE HOME. I THINK THERE ARE SOME ISSUES THAT CAN PROVIDE VALUE HERE. MY RECOMMENDATION TO YOU IS TO EITHER DENY THIS PROJECT OUTRIGHT, OR REMAND THIS BACK TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION AND PLANNING STAFF WITH FURTHER INSTRUCTION TO PROVIDE GREATER PUD BENEFITS, IN TERMS OF THE PROCESS. FINALLY, I REALIZE THIS IS A LITTLE BIT OFF TOPIC, REGARDING THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S TOO IMPORTANT TO BE LEFT TO NON-POLICYMAKERS. I URGE CITY COUNCIL AT SOME POINT TO PROVIDE AN ORDINANCE TO REMOVE THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION PLAN. THIS IS SIMPLY LEFT TO THE POLICYMAKERS, THE PLANNING COMMISSION AND MEMBERS OF THE CITY COUNCIL. THANK YOU. [ APPLAUSE ]
02:03:14.839: >> GOOD EVENING, MY NAME IS JAN TAYLOR I LIVE AT 2814 CRANBROOK. I HAVE BEEN A CITIZEN HERE SINCE 1977. I CURRENTLY WORK WITH HOMELESS PEOPLE. I UNDERSTAND THE ISSUE OF LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING VERY, VERY WELL. AS YOU ALL DO. YOU HAVE HEARD THE STORIES. YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. THIS IS NOT A HOUSING PROJECT FOR HOMELESS PEOPLE. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT. THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY. THANK YOU.
02:03:55.380: >> MARK BRADSHAW, BACK AGAIN, 269 269 EASY STREET. THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT THIS THREE YEARS LATER. IF IT WAS A REASONABLE SITE PLAN, IT WOULD BE APPROVED AND HALF BUILT BY NOW. THERE'S A LOT -- THE RESISTANCE YOU ARE SEEING FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD, THE DENSITY, THE -- JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN GET ENOUGH WATERLINES AND POWERLINES IN THERE TO SUPPORT THE HOUSES DOESN'T MEAN IT'S A GOOD IDEA. IT WILL HAVE A DETRIMENTAL EFFECT ON THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND JUST ON THE -- IT JUST DOESN'T FIT THE NEIGHBORHOOD. IF IT WAS A GOOD PLAN, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN APPROVED A LONG TIME AGO AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HALF BUILT NOW. LET'S STEP BACK A MINUTE AND RETHINK THIS. THANK YOU.
02:04:48.299: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
02:04:56.641: >> ONCE AGAIN, ORA BLACHE, 297 CHESTERFIELD. YOU KNOW THIS BAFFLES ME. MOST OF THE PEOPLE HERE ON CITY COUNCIL ARE ELECTED AS DEMOCRATS. THE SHEER FACT THAT WE ARE HERE FIGHTING FOR THREE YEARS TO BE ABLE TO CONSERVE OUR TREES WHEN THIS IS TREE TOWN, AMAZES ME! YOU KNOW, YOU CAME HERE TO BE REPRESENTED TO BE ABLE TO REPRESENT US. IT SEEMS THAT YOU REPRESENT BIG DEVELOPMENTS AND OUT-OF-TOWNERS. WHERE IS OUR VOICE? , YOU KNOW, YOU COME UP HERE. YOU SAY YOU ARE DEMOCRATS AND YET EVERYTHING YOU DO SCREAMS BEING A REPUBLICAN. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO MY COUNCIL. YOU KNOW, SHOW THAT YOU CARE ABOUT US. DON'T SELL US OUT, SOME DEVELOPER WANTS TO HOLE OUR CITY HOSTAGE. WHY ARE WE NEGOTIATING WITH PEOPLE WHO ACT LIKE TERRORISTS? [ APPLAUSE ] YOU KNOW, THIS IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE RUN BY FEAR. THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE RUN BY FACTS. THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE RUN BY PEOPLE GOING OUT AND MAKING SURE THAT EXISTING COMMUNITY CAN EVEN BE ABLE TO UPHOLD THIS BURDEN, OUR SEWAGE SYSTEM. DO YOU UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH OUR ELECTRICITY GETS KNOCKED OUT IN OUR COMMUNITY AS IT IS? I MEAN, TIME AND TIME AGAIN, SMALL LITTLE WINDS, WE LOSE OUR ELECTRICITY FOR DAYS. 40  HOW IS THIS GOING TO BETTERR INFRASTRUCTURE TO HANDLE THE OTHER 50 HOUSES COME INTO THIS COMMUNITY. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE ARE HERE, WHY YOU ARE STILL CONSIDERING TO SELL US OUT. STAND UP FOR US. DO THE JOB YOU WERE ELECTED TO DO. YOU HAVE HEARD THREE PEOPLE IN MY COMMUNITY AND MY UP TO, YOU KNOW, SAY THIS IS NOT WHAT WE WANT. PLEASE BE THE VOICE OF YOUR COMMUNITY. BE THE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE WHO ELECTED YOU. YOU KNOW, I EMAILED EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU. I EMA RECEIVED EPAILS FROM TWO F YOU. ONE WAS A FORM LETTER. WE EXPECT YOU TO DO BETTER FOR OUR COMMUNITY.
02:07:18.449: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
02:07:27.992: >> HI, MICHELE BERQUITTE. 2829 EASY STREET. ONE OF THE THINGS I FOUND INTERESTING IN THE TV REPORT IS THAT THE PETITIONER WANTS TO CHANGE THE UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE TO NOT INCLUDE BASEMENT SQUARE FOOTAGE IN THE MAXIMUM 2,000 SQUARE FOOT CAP IN R1E ZONING, WHICH TO ME SAYS YOU COULD BUILD 1,000 SQUARE FOOT HOME WITH A THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT BASEMENT AND BE 2,000 SQUARE FEET WHICH WOULD ACTUALLY BE QUITE SIMILAR TO THE HOUSES THAT WE HAVE IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD RIGHT NOW. SO IF I'M UNDERSTANDING THIS CORRECTLY, IT SOUTHBOUNDS TO ME LIKE THE REZONING WANTS TO -- IT SOUNDS TO ME THAT THE REZONING WANTS TO CHANGE, R1E, TO PUD JUST TO BUILD BIGGER HOMES TO MAXIMIZE PROFIT.
02:08:20.445: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
02:08:27.385: >> I THOUGHT ABOUT -- THE SITE PLAN. I THINK IT'S SITE PLANS WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE SIZE OF THESE HOUSES. IS THAT MART OF THE SITE PLAN? THAT'S LEGIT? THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE 2,000 SQUARE FOOT HOUSES AS I UNDERSTAND IT AND AT ONE OF THE PLANNING COMMISSION MEETINGS, THE DEVELOPER -- HOPE YOU ASK THE DEVELOPER ABOUT THIS, WAS BEING ASKED ABOUT THE UNFINISHED PAVEMENTS AND HOW DEEP THEY WERE GOING TO BE AND HE SAID SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT THAT, WELL, WE COULD JUST DIG THEM FULL DEPTH BECAUSE YOU MIGHT AS WELL, BECAUSE IT'S NOT MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE -- HE WILL CALL THEM -- IT WILL BE CALLED STORAGE SPACE BUT THEN HE TUGGED -- I'M NOT GOING TO QUOTE, BUT FARRA PHRASE, AND IT'S ALSO A GREAT PLACE FOR THE KIDS TO PLAY. THAT'S LIVING SPACE. HE'S BUILDING SOMETHING WE ARE CALLING IT THOUSAND SQUARE FEET HOUSES BUT THEY ARE GOING TO BE MARKETED AS 3,000 SQUARE FEET HOUSES AND PELL WILL PAY EXTRAS FOR THE FULL BASEMENTS AND THE CITY WILL NOT GO AND POLICE THIS. HE WILL SAY THAT, OH, THE NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATION. THE NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATION WILL MISS IT AND SAY, NEIGHBOR YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO REFINISH YOUR BASEMENT. YEAH. THE NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATION, THEY ARE GOING TO PROSERVE THE TREES TOO. THIS IS A SITE PLAN THING. THEY ARE GOING TO SAY, IF THERE'S LITTLE SAPLINGS COMING UP NEAR THOSE 300-YEAR-OLD TREES, THE ONE THAT HAS BEEN PRESERVED, WITH VERY TO LEAVE THOSE ALONE BECAUSE A BIG PART OF HOW IT GO THROUGH PLANNING COMMISSION, IT WAS SUPPOSED TO PRESERVE THOSE TREES AND THE ABILITY FOR THAT SAME SEED STOCK, THAT SAME GENETIC STOCK TO RECREATE. OKAY. THERE'S THESE KIDS. IT'S TIME TO PLAY KICK BALL IN THE ONE LITTLE TINY BIT OF LAND THAT'S LEFT THERE, WITHOUT HAVING TO GO AND BRAVE PACKARD AND EASY STREET TO GET OVER TO BURR PARK. AND THERE'S A SAPLING IN THE WAY OF WHERE THIRD BASE OUGHT TO BE. SOMEBODY IS GOING TO CUT IT DOWN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. YOU GUYS KNOW THAT THAT'S THE SITE PLAN. IT'S JUST -- IT'S DISINGENUOUS, AND THE LAST THING, TO TALK ABOUT ANY OF THIS STUFF, WELL, WE THE CITY, AND YOU ALL. I DON'T THINK YOU ARE THE PROBLEM. I REALLY DON'T. I DON'T WANT TO PICK ON A PARTICULAR MAN, BUT I THINK THE DEVELOPER HAS MESSED UP HERE AND HE'S JUST -- I HAVE TROUBLE WITH THAT. HUMOR HAS IT IF YOU PASS THE PUD -- EXCUSE ME, IF YOU VOTE DOWN THE PUD, THE PUBLISHER -- THE PUBLISHER? GOD. THE DEVELOPER MAY SUE THE CITY AND RUMOR HAS IT IF YOU PASS IT, HE PROBABLY WON'T SUE THE CITY, AT LEAST UNTIL THE NEXT TIME. THIS HAS A BEARING ON SITE PLAN. YOU ARE ASKED TO APPROVE THIS SITE PLAN UNDER DURESS. WE ARE BEING ASKED TO ACCEPT IT UNLESS THE OWNER AND DEVELOPER ARE CLEAR CUT EVIL ENOUGH TO CLEAR CUT, AVOIDING A LAWSUIT SEEMS TO BE THE MOST IMPORTANT, IF PERHAPS THE SECRET BENEFIT. I SUPPOSE WHEN CALCULATING THE PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTA VOIDING A LAWSUIT, SHOULD NOT GET TO COUNT AS A PUBLIC BENEFIT.
02:11:38.743: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
02:11:51.756: >> PETE BENSON, 2810 EASY STREET. I THINK THE DENSITY IS WRONG FOR THIS AREA. THAT'S REALLY THE SEMINAL POINT AGAIN WITH THE ISSUES OF STORMWATER. I WORK WITH A LOT OF ENGINEERS. AND THEY TELL YOU THEY CAN ENGINEER THEIR WAY OUT OF ANYTHING. THERE'S LIKELY TO BE PROBLEMMED ASSOCIATES WITH IT. THAT'S REALLY ALL I HAVE TO SAY. AGAIN, WE ARE NOT AGAINST DEVELOPMENT OF THE PROPERTY, AT LEAST I'M NOT AGAINST DEVELOPMENT OF THE PROPERTY. BUT THERE SEEMS TO BE A MORE REASONABLE APPROACH THAT COULD BE TAKING PLACE HERE IN TERMS OF, AGAIN, MAINTAINING THE CHARACTER OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD. I WISH YOU GUYS WOULD CONSIDER THAT. THANK YOU.
02:12:36.567: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEAR? SEEING NO ONE, THIS PUBLIC HEARING IS CLOSED. PUBLIC HEARING NUMBER 5. AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND SECTIONS 5.15, 5.16.3, 5.19.2, AND 5.37.2 OF CHAPTER 55 (UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE) OF TITLE V OF THE CODE OF THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. MARIJUANA RETAILERS, MARIJUANA BUSINESSES AND DESIGNATED MARIJUANA CONSUMPTION FACILITIES. IS THERE ANYONE WOULD WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING?
02:13:15.740: >> MY NAME IS CHARLES REAMES PACKARD ROAD. I JUST WANTED TO SHOW UP AND SEE WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN. I HAVE THINK YOU ALL KNOW WHAT YOUR VOTERS AND CITIZENS WANT TO HAPPEN. THEY WANT YOU TO BE BOLD AND DO SOMETHING NEW AND BREAK NEW GROUND. THIS IS ALWAYS HARD TO GO WHERE YOU DON'T HAVE A TEMPLATE LAID OUT, BUT WE CAN DO IT, AND ANN ARBOR HAS DONE IT IN THE PAST. WE WANT MARIJUANA LEGALIZATION IN ANN ARBOR AT THE 78% RATE. 78% OF THE PEOPLE ARE THE ONES WOULD MAKE POLICY. WE WILL HAVE THAT 22%, THAT OTHER 22% COMING IN HERE AND HOWLING, THE 22% DOESN'T MAKE POLICY IN A DEMOCRACY. THE 78% MAKES A POLICY. WE WANT LEGALIZATION. WE WANT SOCIAL USE TO FOLLOW LEGALIZATION SO THAT THE BENEFITS OF CANNABIS CAN REALLY BE RECOGNIZED AND NET IN OUR COMMUNITY. I THINK WE HAVE ALL GOT A STORY FROM OUR OWN FAMILY ABOUT ALCOHOL OR MANY STORIES AND WE NEED A REAL ALTERNATIVE. WE DIDN'T LEGALIZE IT TO ARE PEOPLE TO HIDE AND HAVE IT IN THEIR HOME SOMEWHERE. THEY NEED TO GET OUT AND SOCIAL SIZE SO THAT CANNABIS CAN BECOME AN ALTERNATIVE TO ALCOHOL SO PEOPLE CAN LIVE A LOT HEALTHIER, HAPPIER LIVES. [ APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU. MY MINE POINT REALLY TONIGHT IS SETBACKS. YES, YOU USE SETBACKS FOR MANY DIFFERENT LICENSE TYPES HERE IN ANN ARBOR, BUT LET'S NOT MAKE SETBACKS FOR CONSUMPTION ESTABLISHMENTS FROM ANYTHING OTHER THAN OTHER CONSUMPTION ESTABLISHMENTS. PLEASE DON'T MAKE SETBACKS FROM CONSUMPTION ESTABLISHMENTS FROM EVERY OTHER FORM OF CANNABIS BUSINESS THAT EXISTED OR YOU WON'T HAVE ANY PLACE THAT CONSUMPTION ESTABLISHMENTS CAN EXIST. I SPOKE FOR A LONG TIME TODAY WITH DIRECTOR BRISBO AT THE STATE MICHIGAN DIRECTOR, STATE DIRECTOR AND WE MAY HAVE A PROBLEM AT THE BEGIN WITH GETTING FREE STANDING, GETTING DISTRIBUTION OUTSIDE OF THE REGULAR PROVISIONING CENTERS, BUT ACTUALLY, WE WILL HAVE COFFEE HOUSES AND RESTAURANTS AND YOGA STUDIOS AND WEIGHT LIFTING ROOMS AND EVERY SORT OF AREA WILL BE LICENSED AND USED CANNABIS FREELY. AND YOU CAN USE ALL OF THESE VARIOUS ILLEGAL DRUGS. THANK YOU.
02:15:52.663: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING? SEEING NO ONE THIS -- OH, I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T REALIZE. MY APOLOGIES.
02:16:09.714: >> IT'S OKAY. ORA CHESTERFIELD, HI, EVERYBODY. ON THIS ONE ISSUE, I REALLY AAPPRECIATE WHAT THE COUNCIL HAS DONE IN BEING ABLE TO UPSTAND OUR MEDICAL MARIJUANA FACILITIES. I THINK YOU HAVE HANDLED ALL OF THEM REALLY WELL. I THINK WHEN WE GO FORWARD ON RECREATION TO BE ABLE TO UTILIZE THAT, WHETHER IT BE A COFFEE HOUSE OR THEATER OR WHATEVER OTHER ESTABLISHMENT THAT IS CHOSEN, I THINK THAT IN THIS CASE, YOU WILL BE A GOOD STEWARD OF THAT PROCESS, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE I THINK THAT IT WILL STREAMLINE PRETTY WELL FOR ALL. VARIETY OF DISPENSARIES THAT ARE THERE ARE HERE. ONE OF THE THINGS I WANT TO SPEAK ON, DURING HASH BASH, WE HAD A RECORD INFLUX OF PEOPLE INTO TOWN, AND VERY RAMPANT MARIJUANA USE ALL OVER. BUT EVEN THROUGHOUT ALL OF THAT, YOU KNOW, EXCESSIVE USE, ESPECIALLY ON THAT PARTICULAR DAY, THERE WAS VERY LITTLE TRAFFIC VIOLATIONS AND VERY LITTLE PROBLEMS WITH POLICE, AND EVEN WITH ALL THE CONFUSION AND EVERYTHING ELSE, THE CITY HANDLED IT AS THEY DO EVERY YEAR, VERY W WELL. YOU KNOW, ANN ARBOR HAS A GOOD TRACK RECORD OF BEING ABLE TO MANAGE OURSELVES WHEN IT COMES TO MARIJUANA USE. I WOULD APPRECIATE IF YOU KNOW, COULD YOU BE GOOD STEWARDS WHEN THIS COMES UP. AND REALIZE THAT, YOU KNOW, WE LIKE TO BE ABLE TO GATHER AND BE SOCIAL JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE DOES. I DON'T REALLY LIKE TO DRINK. I DON'T REALLY LIKE TO BE PLACES WHERE THERE'S DRINKING ALL THE TIME. YOU KNOW, PEOPLE HAVE EGREGIOUS BEHAVIOR AND THEY GET LOUD. YOU KNOW, THERE'S A LOT MORE PROBLEMS AND STUFF LIKE THAT. AND IT WOULD NICE TO GO TO A PLACE THAT DOESN'T JUST CATER ALCOHOL, THAT YOU CAN GO OUT AND HAVE A GOOD TIME. SO APPRECIATE WHATEVER YOU ARE GOGOING TO BE DOING IN THAT. THANK YOU.
02:18:34.592: >> GOOD EVENING. MY NAME IS DIANE GINOLA AND I LIVE IN THE 4th WARD. THE PROPOSAL THAT WAS PASSED LA LAST YEAR, SIMPLY REQUESTS RECREATION MARIJUANA AND COMMERCIAL SALES TO STATE LICENSED RETAILERS. NOWHERE WAS IT MENTIONED THAT CONSUMPTION CENTERS OR PUBLIC USE CENTERS COULD BE ESTABLISHED. THE CITY CAN'T ASSUME THAT NOW THAT THE BALANCELET PROPOSAL PASSED THAT EVERYONE WOULD BE ALLOW MARIJUANA FACILITIES AROUND. WE'RE NOT TRYING TO OVERTURN THE BALLOT INITIATIVES. THEY CAN SMOKE ALL THEY WANT IN THE PRIVACY OF THEIR OWN HOMES. THREE CONSUMPTION CENTERS ARE A DANGER TO THE SAFETY OF ALL OF US ON THE ROADS. ALL THE P PATRONS WHO LEAVE THEE FACILITIES HIGH, ARE A DIRECT DANGER TO THOSE. ALCOHOL USE AND MARIJUANA USE ARE THE SYSTEM, THEY ARE NOT, YOU CAN GO TO A BAR OR RESTAURANT AND HAVE ONLY ONE ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE WITH OR WITHOUT A MEAL. YOU DON'T HAVE TO GET DRUNK TO ENJOY ONE DRINK. THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WHO LEAVE BARS DO NOT LEAVE DRUNK OR ARE IMPAIRED DRIVERS. IT IS THE ABUSE OF ALCOHOL, NOT THE USE OF ALCOHOL THAT'S THE PROBLEM IN RELATION TO DRIVING. HOWEVER, THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WHO LEAVE CONSUMPTION CENTERS WILL BE IMPAIRED DRIVERS. THE ONLY REASON FOR THE CONSUMPTION CENTERS IS TO GET HIGH. IT'S NOT THE USE AND NOT THE ABUSE OF MARIJUANA THAT'S THE PROBLEM IN RELATION TO DRIVING. I REALIZE THAT MANY ON COUNCIL WANT TO BE THE FIRST TO OPEN CONSUMPTION CENTERS BECAUSE YOU CONSIDER US LEADERS. I JUST DON'T THINK THAT ANN ARBOR NEEDS TO BE A LEADER WHERE WE BECOME THE SCAM TOM OTHER COMMUNITIES IN WHAT NOT NO DO BY MAKING AVOIDABLE MISTAKES. WE SHOULD BE A LEADER BY SHOWING OTHER COMMUNITIES HOW NOT TO RUSH AND HOW TO ENGAGE OUR COMMUNITY IT DISCUSSION ABOUT THESE CENTERS. WE SHOULD LEAD ON HOW TO HAVE OPEN DISCUSSIONS IN THE COMMUNITY ON THE RIGHT WAY TO PLAN, AND SET UP THESE CENTERS WITHOUT INTIMIDATION FROM THE PRO MARIJUANA CROWD. THERE ARE SO MANY ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE DISCUSSED IN RELATION TO THE CENTERS. PARKING, IMPAIRED DRIVING AND HOW MANY USE CENTERS ARE NEEDED OR WANTED BY THE RESIDENTS. YOU ARE SET TO PASS 56 OF THESE CENTERS FOR 25 SQUARE MILES. THAT'S WAY TOO MUCH! RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA IS LEGAL BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT WE CAN'T PUT LIMITS ON WHERE AND HOW CONSUMPTION CENTERS ARE PLACED IN OUR COMMUNITY. AWE PROVING THESE CENTERS WITH BARELY A THOUGHT. MOST OF THE PUBLIC DOESN'T REALIZE. YOU HAVE BEEN ARGUING MORE TIME OVER THE LIFE OF INDUSTRY THAN HOW CONSUMPTION CENTERS MAY AFFECT ALL OF THE LIVES ON THE ROAD. I ASK YOU TO PASS THE REGULATION AND THE ZONING IN THE RETAIL SHOPS AS EXPECTED AND DISCUSS THE CONSUMPTION CENTERS AT A LATER DATE. THE LIVES OF RESIDENT SHOULD MIRROR AS MUCH OR MORE DISCUSSION TIME THAN DISCUSSION ABOUT SAVING THE TREES. THANK YOU.
02:21:33.037: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
02:21:45.015: >> GOOD EVENING. AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU. MY NAME IS DENNIS HAYES. OWN A PROPERTY ON 4th AVENUE AND ANN TREAT I HAVE BEEN A RESIDENT OF ANN ARBOR FOR 40 YEARS AND I'M HERE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THESE ORDINANCE AMENDMENTS AND I WILL HAVE TO TELL YOU, YOU HAVE MY ACCOMMODATIONS IF YOU READ THEM. THESE ARE JUST INCREDIBLY DETAILED AND TWISTED, BUT THE POINT IS THAT SINCE 1972 AND I WAS INVOLVED IN THE FIRST LEGALIZATION OF THE MARIJUANA -- THE ORDINANCE THAT SET A $5 FINE. I WAS HERE IN '74, WHEN WE REDITT THAT. AND AFTER IT HAD BEEN DECLARED UP CONSTITUTIONAL BY THE DISTRICT COURT. AND THE CITY PASSED IT. IN 19 -- EXCUSE ME. 20 ROLL, WHEN MEDICAL MARIJUANA PASSED, ANN ARBOR WAS A LEADER IN CREATING THE OPPORTUNITY TO -- FOR PEOPLE TO LEGITIMATELY USE MARIJUANA FOR MEDICAL PURPOSES. IN 2016, WHEN THE STATE FINALLY PASSED REGULATIONS FOR THE MEDICAL MARIJUANA ACT, WE WERE INVOLVED IN THAT TOO. 2018, WHEN THE RECREATIONAL LAW WAS PASSED, WE SUPPORTED IT FULLY AND TIP TO SUPPORT IT AND WITH REGARD TO THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER, THE EVIDENCE -- THE CLINICAL EVIDENCE IS THAT PEOPLE WHO USE MARIJUANA AND DRIVE, DRIVE SLOWER. AND THAT'S TRUE. IN FACT -- THE FACT IS MARIJUANA PEOPLE ARE PROBABLY SAFER THAN REGULAR DRIVERS, BUT THAT'S BESIDE THE POINT. THE ISSUE IS WHETHER OR NOT THE CONSUMPTION CENTERS AND THE -- WHETHER WHETHER THE CONSUMPTION CENTERS AND THE MICROBUSINESSES WILL BE A BENEFIT TO THE COMMUNITY. 56 OF THESE MAY BE MORE THAN WE ANTICIPATED AND THEY MAY BE TOO MANY BUT THEN AGAIN, THEY MAY NOT. THERE ARE A LOT OF MARIJUANA BUSINESSES IN TOWN, AND THEY -- YOU KNOW BETTER THAN I DO THAT THEY HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED VERY REASONABLY, NO PROBLEMS. THEY HAVE MAINTAINED THEIR PROPERTY, THEY CONTRIBUTE TO THEIR COMMUNITY AND THEY WILL GENERALLY BE A POSITIVE FORCE FOR THE REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT, FOR RENTS, FOR PUBLICATION PLACES AND THE NECESSITY OF PASSING THIS IS ANOTHER STEP IN ANN ARBOR'S HISTORY MAKING ABILITY. AND YOU SHOULD PASS IT AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO SO.
02:24:53.804: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
02:24:54.404: >> RON LEV 2645 EASY STREET. I HAVE BEEN IN ANN ARBOR FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO SMOKE POT AND I HAVE SMOKED POT. I DON'T PARTICULARLY LOVE POT. THERE'S PROBABLY THOUSANDS OF MARIJUANA CONSUMPTION CENTERS, THEY ARE CALL PEOPLE'S HOMES. SOME OF THEM GET HIGH AND DRIVE HOME. I DON'T THINK THE ADDITION OF THE ABILITY TO DO THAT IN A FEW MORE PUBLIC BUSINESS-LIKE SETS IS GOING TO HAVE ANY IMPACT WHATSOEVER ON SAFETY OR ANYTHING AT ALL. SO I THINK RESTRICTIONS ON THAT ARE PART OF THE PRUDISH, ARBITRARY RESTRICTION OF SOCIAL AND CULTURAL BEHAVIOR THAT WE ARE SHUCKING AND WE SHUCKED -- WITH MARIJUANA LEGALIZATION, AFTER YEARS OF PEOPLE BEING PUT IN JAIL NOR IT. I THINK IT WOULD BE NICE TO ALLOW THAT IN THE SPIRIT OF LIBERTY AND THE SPIRIT OF JUST NOT HAVING ARBITRARY RESTRICTIONS ON BEHAVIOR. THANK YOU.
02:25:48.892: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
02:25:52.629: >> GOOD EVENING. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK, BRIAN FENNIC, 4th WARD. WHEN WE DISCUSSED -- WELL, FIRST OF ALL, WE HAD PROVISIONING CENTERS IN THIS TOWN NOW FOR, YOU KNOW, EVERYA DECADE, AND I REMEMBER WHEN WE FIRST STARTED TALKING ABOUT WRITING AN ORDINANCE TO ALLOW FOR PROVISIONING CENTERS HERE, YOU KNOW, THERE WAS A LOT OF DISCUSSION, OF COURSE, AND THERE WERE PEOPLE WHO WERE AFRAID THAT THE SKY WAS GOING TO FALL AND HERE WE ARE TEN YEARS LATER, MORE THAN TEN YEARS LATER, WITH STATE LICENSES AVAILABLE, AND THE SKY HAS NOT FALLEN. IT IS FIRMLY IN PLACE, WHEN WE DRAFTED THE ORDINANCE FOR LICENSING IN THIS STATE -- IN THIS CITY, I WAS ON THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE AND WE HAD SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THERE SHOULD BE A CAP AND WE THOUGHT THAT THE MARKET SHOULD REGULATE ITSELF IN THAT WAY. THE CAP -- IT WILL SET ITS OWN CAP, BUT WITH -- BASED ON DISTANCES AVAILABLE REAL ESTATE INVENTORY, THE MARKET ITSELF, AND SO LET'S NOT PUT AN ARTIFICIAL NUMBER ON IT AND LET'S ALLOW IT TO FLOURISH ON ITS OWN AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS. AND IT WAS PASSED WITHOUT A CAP. AND 28 BUSINESSES APPLIED FOR LICENSES AND AGAIN, THE SKY DIDN'T FALL. THERE WAS ONLY 28, BUT THEN A CAP CAME ALONG IN AN EFFORT -- I DON'T KNOW, TO PUMP THE BRAKES BUT WHAT IT EFFECTIVELY DID WAS PUT THE MARKET HERE IN REVERSE. WE HAD 18 BUSINESSES AT THAT TIME. THERE ARE NOW NINE OPERATING OF THE 28 -- OF THE 26 THAT HAVE BEEN PERMITTED, ONLY NINE OPERATE. THE NUMBER THAT WAS GIVEN AT THE PREVIOUS WORK SESSION WAS INCORRECT. THAT INCLUDED ALSO OTHER LICENSE TYPES, NOT JUST PROVISIONING CENTERS. HERE WE ARE MORE THAN A YEAR INTO A STATE LICENSED REGULATED INDUSTRY, AND WE HAVE FEWER THAN WHEN IT WAS UNREGULATED AND THE DIRTY LITTLE SECRET IS OF THOSE REMAINING LICENSES, VERY FEW OF THEM WILL ACTUALLY OPERATE BEFORE RECREATIONAL COME ONLINE. WHAT THEY ARE DOING IS THEY ARE EITHER TRADING IT AS A COMMODITY, HOLDING OUT, WAITING FOR RECREATIONAL. IF WE WANT A ROBUST REGULATED MARKET IN THIS UNTO, WE NEED TO GET RID OF A CAP THAT'S ARTIFICIALLY IN PLACE. WE NEED TO -- OR INCREASE THE CAP TO ALLOW FOR NEW BLOOD, BLOOD THAT HAS BEEN EITHER WAITING IN THE WINGS, LIVE IN THIS TOWN, NOT FROM OUT OF STATE, OUT-OF-STATE MONEY, AND PEOPLE READY, WILLING AND ABLE TO OPERATE IN THIS TOWN. LET THEY OPERATE HERE AS OPPOSED TO PEOPLE WOULD WANT TO SPECK LATE AND WAIT AROUND AND SEE -- SPECULATE AND WAIT AROUND AND SEE HOW MUCH MONEY THEY CAN GET FOR THEIR PROPERTY. LANDLORDS ARE KICKING PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR LOCATIONS BECAUSE THEY SEE NOW THIS WORKS AND SO LET'S GET RID OF THAT, LET'S GET RID OF THAT OPERATOR AND USE THAT PERMIT FOR OURSELVES. YOU ARE CREATING AN ARTIFICIAL ENVIRONMENT HERE. YOU ARE ALLOWING FOR, YOU KNOW, SPECULATORS TO USE THAT 28 NUMBER. IF WE WANT A TRULY ROBUST REGULATED MARK, WE NEED TO LIFT THE CAP. THANK YOU.
02:29:00.383: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
02:29:12.529: >> THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. MY NAME IS NATHAN SHEDDIC. I REPRESENT MEDICINE MAN WHICH IS A LICENSED PROFISSIONING CENTER ON PLYMOUTH ROAD. I WILL PIGGYBACK ON SOME OF THE POINTS THAT WERE JUST MADE REGARDING THE NINE PROVISIONING CENTERS BEING OPEN AND THE REST WAITING FOR REC. I THINK THE ORDINANCE THAT YOU HAD FOR MEDICAL WAS PRETTY GOOD, BUT I AGREE WITH THE GENTLEMAN BEFORE ON THE CAPS BECAUSE WHAT HAS HAPPENED IS THE S.E.U.s HAVE ALLOWED THE PROPERTY OWNERS TO REALLY JUST DICTATE EVERYTHING. AND WHAT DOES THIS LOOK LIKE YOU MAY ASK? I KNOW A PROPERTY WAS -- A DEAL WAS BROUGHT TO ONE OF MY CLIENTS, THE GUY HAS A LEASE FOR SIX YEARS WITH A TEN-YEAR TERM. HE DOESN'T HAVE THE BUILDING TO SELL. HE'S SELLING THE LEASE FOR $8 MILLION. THE CHANCES OF THAT GETTING SOLD ARE RIDICULOUS. IF YOUR GOAL IS TO OPEN UP 28 OF THESE PLACES, THIS ONE WILL NOT BE ONE OF THEM. HE CANNOT GET A STATE LICENSE IN THIS LOCATION, AND IT IS JUST BEING SHOPPED. THAT'S ONE THAT I KNOW ABOUT. THERE ARE NINE OPEN, AND THERE HAVE BEEN 20 S.E.U.s OR 26 S.E.U.s THAT ARE OUT THERE. WHAT YOU DO THINK IS HAPPENING WITH THE REST OF THEM, I WOULD IMAGINE SIMILAR DEALS. I THINK WHAT THE COUNCIL MIGHT WANT TO DO IS TRY AND FORCE THESE PLACES TO OPEN. SO HOW DO YOU THAT? THERE IS NOTHING IN THE ORDINANCE ABOUT THE S.E.U. CAP. PROCESS THE S.E.U.s THAT ARE IN THE QUEUE AND LET THEM GO FORWARD. MAKE IT A RACE. MAKE THE PERMIT HOLDERS, YOU KNOW, NEED TO OPEN IN ORDER TO GET A RECREATIONAL LICENSE. IT'S ALL DONE ON SPECULATION FOR THE RECREATIONAL MARKET AS THE GENTLEMEN BEFORE WE SAID. THE PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO RUN BUSINESSES ARE GETTING SQUEEZED AND THEY ARE THE LOCALS. THE MONEY THAT'S COMING IN, SOMEONE WILL PAY $8 MILLION FOR A LEASE. THIS IS GOING TO BE A COMPANY FROM OUT OF STATE. IT WILL BE A COMPANY FROM, YOU KNOW, TORONTO. THESE ARE THE ONLY PEOPLE WOULD WILL BE ABLE TO AFFORD. THIS YOU ARE ESSENTIALLY PRICING PEOPLE OUT, SIMILAR TO WHAT WE JUST HEARD ABOUT THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING, I GUESS. BUT I WOULD THINK THAT YOU KNOW, ALLOWING THE PEOPLE THAT ARE HERE, OPENING FACILITIES NOW, I THINK GIVING THEM PRIORITY IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED. AND I THINK THE RETAIL ASPECT OF THE RECREATIONAL ORDINANCE WHERE THEY ARE THE SAME S.E.U. PROCESS THAT HASN'T WORKED ALREADY, I THINK IT SHOULD BE RECONSIDERED, AND, YOU KNOW, EITHER ELIMINATE THE CAP OR DO SOMETHING TO FORCE THE PLACES TO OPEN SO IT'S NOT JUST BEING TRADED OFF AS COMMODITIES ON SPECULATION. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
02:32:01.865: >> GOOD EVENING AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. BENJAMIN JOE. I HAVE AN OFFICE OVER HERE OR NORTH 4th AND I'M A RESIDENT OF THE 5th WARD. I WOULD ASK THAT THE COUNCIL TODAY PASS ORDINANCES AS WRITTEN. I BELIEVE THEY ARE COMMON SENSE ORDINANCES THAT WERE DEVELOPED THROUGH THE COMMITTEES THAT WE HAD FOR MEDICAL. THEY BEEN DEBATED IN THIS CHAMBER BEFORE AND TO BE QUITE HONEST, I WILL PIGGYBACK OFF THE LAST TWO GENTLEMEN'S ARGUMENTS. WE HAVE NINE PROVISIONING CENTERS IN ANN ARBOR RIGHT NOW. I DON'T SEE A NEED TO RAISE THE CAP OVER 28 RIGHT NOW OR TO MAKE IT EVEN MORE SO THAT WE CAN HAVE 35. THE MARKET SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO DEVELOP. THESE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN DEVELOPING. WE HAVE HEARD MANY HIS TRIES COME UP HERE TONIGHT, FROM A FEW OF THE SPEAKERS ABOUT HOW THIS LAW HAS GONE INTO REGULATION. I WOULD VENTURE BACK A FEW MONTHS AGO IF YOU CAN REMEMBER, THERE WAS A SUPPLY SHORTAGE. PEOPLE WERE HAVING TROUBLE GETTING THROUGH STATE. IT HASN'T BEEN THAT LONG. THESE PLACES HAVEN'T OPENED NOT BECAUSE OF PURE SPECULATION, BECAUSE I'M SURE AS MANY PEOPLE IN THIS AUDIENCE AND UP HERE ON THE COUNCIL KNOW, IT TAKES A BIT TO GET A BUSINESS GOING. TO DO THINGS CORRECTLY, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU ARE IN ONE OF THE MOST HEAVILY REGULATED INDUSTRIES IN MICHIGAN. I THINK YOU GUYS DID A GREAT JOB WITH THE ORIGINAL ORDINANCE AND I WOULD ASK YOU TO PASS IT AS WRITTEN. THANK YOU.
02:33:18.908: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
02:33:25.582: >> HI, I'M KELLY WALKISH, I CAN SENSE THE ENTHUSIASM FOR THE ORDINANCE, BUT I THINK IT COULD HAVE A FEW SMALL TWEAKS. PARTICULARLY, I WOULD LIKE TO OFFER SUPPORT FOR CONSIDERING THE INCLUSION OF A MARIJUANA OVERSIGHT BODY, THAT PARALLELS THE RULES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE COUNCIL LIQUOR LICENSE REVIEW BOARD. WHILE LIQUOR IS PERHAPS AN IMPERFECT SUBSTANCE. IT'S HAD A POSITIVE ROLE IN THE COMMUNITY FOR THE LIQUOR BOARD AND ARBITRATING DIFFERENCES COMING TOGETHER IN ONE VOICE. IT ALSO AT A MINIMUM RETAINS THE LOCAL CONTROL OF DECISION MAKING AROUND THESE ISSUE IN ANN ARBOR AND DOESN'T ABDICATE THEY DECISION MAKING TO THE STATE OR OTHER BODIES WHICH IS A BENEFIT TO MARIJUANA AND THE REST OF THE COMMUNITY. IMPORTANTLY AS I MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY AS A MOTHER OF A TODDLER AND PEDIATRIC ONCOLOGIST HERE IN ANN ARBOR, I WOULD INCLUDE THE EXPANSION OF THE 1,000 BUFFER BETWEEN MARIJUANA BUSINESSES THAT'S CURRENTLY AFFORDED TO K-12 SCHOOLS TO DAY CARES OR CHILD CARE CENTERS. THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT AS THE PROVISIONING CENTERS HAVE 28, WHICH HAS BEEN DISCUSSED A LOT IS ACTUALLY BEING EXPANDED TO A TOTAL OF 82 DIFFERENT SITES, WHERE MARIJUANA IS GOING TO BE AVAILABLE IN THE CITY, WHETHER YOU COUNT THE CONSUMPTION CENTERS AND THE MICROGROWERS. THAT'S 3 PER SQUARE MILE. THAT'S A LITTLE BIT DENSE BY MY TAKING. IT ALSO KINDLY REMINDS YOU THAT IT'S QUITE FEASIBLE TO MANAGE THE BUFFER BETWEEN DAY CARES. IN TINY COMMUNITIES IN FORSYTHE, WYOMING, AND BOULDER, COLORADO, WHICH IS SIMILAR IN CHARACTER AND NATURE TO ANN ARBOR, AND EVEN SUPERLARGE SCALE COMMUNITIES LIKE LOS ANGELES HAVE MANAGED THIS. IT'S ALSO A FAVOR TO HAVE THIS BUFFER INCREASED FOR K-12 SCHOOLS AND DAY CARES BY THE SAME MEASURE. THIS WAS SHOWN IN THE MOCK POLL, APPROXIMATELY TWO-THIRDS OF PARENTS AND THE POLL WAS LOOKING AT PARENTAL ATTITUDES ON MARIJUANA IN THE MEDICAL SETTING WHICH WAS PUBLISHED LAST FEBRUARY. AND INTERESTINGLY, IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THIS IS NOT IN DIRECT CONFLICT NOT GROWTH OF MARIJUANA BUSINESSES. THIS SAME PARENTS WHO VOTED FOR THE SCHOOL BUFFER AND THE DAY CARE BUFFER, THEY ALSO SUPPORTED MARIJUANA, MEDICAL MARIJUANA IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. I THINK THERE'S A GRAND OPPORTUNITY TO INCLUDE BOTH A LITTLE BIT OF THE OVERSIGHT MORE LOCALLY HERE IN ANN ARBOR WITH A MARIJUANA OVERSIGHT BODY AND THE 1,000-FOOT BUFFER BETWEEN DAY CARES ARE CHILD CARE CENTERS AND THE MARIJUANA CENTERS JUST TO CREATE A BALANCE FOR EVERYONE IN THE COMMUNITY SO THAT WE ALL CAN ENJOY IT IN WAYS THAT WE SEE BEST FOR OUR OWN FAMILIES. THANK YOU.
02:36:11.414: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
02:36:25.128: >> GOOD EVENING, MY NAME IS NICK ZATEL, 213 EAST JEFFERSON. I WARE A FEW DIFFERENT HATS IN THE CANNABIS REALM. I WAS ONE OF THE CAMPAIGN MANAGERS FOR M.I. LEGALIZE IN PROPOSAL ONE. I HAVE BEEN THE EXECUTIVE PLANNER FOR HASH BASH, SINCE 2011. AND I'M CURRENTLY ASSISTANT GENERAL MANAGER AT THE HOME OF GENERAL MEDICINE IN ANN ARBOR. I WANT TO THANK YOU FIRST AND FOREMOST FOR PUTTING FORWARD THIS ORDINANCE BEFORE GETTING IT HERE TO THE SECOND READING HERE TONIGHT. I WOULD ENCOURAGE TO ADOPT AND PASS THIS ORDINANCE. AS THE ORGANIZER OF THE ANN ARBOR HASH BASH, WE ARE COMING UP ON OUR 49th YEAR. IN 2021, WE WILL BE S CELEBRATIG THE JUBILEE AN ANNIVERSARY OF TE ANN ARBOR HASH BASH. FOR DECADES, FOR LITERAL DECADES, THE HASH BASH IN ANN ARBOR DID SERVE AS A PLACE FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE TO FEEL SAFE, WHETHER THEY WERE CANNABIS USERS, CASUALLY, CANNABIS ENTHUSIASTS TO THE UTMOST DEGREE, OR, YOU KNOW, MEDICAL CANNABIS PATIE PATIENTS WHO WERE LOOKING FOR OTHERS LIKE THEM AND WANTED TO TALK TO THEM. IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY NOW WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE MRTMA TO EMBRACE CANNABIS USE AND PROVIDE A SAFE PLACE. THERE'S TALK ABOUT SAFETY, EARLIER. I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO REBUT ONE OF THE RESIDENTS WHO SPOKE BEFORE ME. I UNDERSTAND THEIR INTENTIONS ARE GOOD AND SHARE SIMILAR CONCERNS ABOUT SAFETY, BUT I WANTED TO MAKE TWO CLARIFICATIONS. THE FIRST BEING THAT PROSE POLL AS ONE, THE MRTMRA DID, IN FACT, MAKE ALLOWANCES FOR THE GOVERNING AGENCY OR THE REGULATORY AGENCY TO DEFINE AND ALLOW FOR DESIGNATED CONSUMPTION SITES AND THAT WAS INCLUDED IN THE MOST RECENT EMERGENCY RULES. I ALSO WANTED TO TOUCH ON A COMMENT THAT THE SIMPLE USE AND APPLICATION AND USE OF MARIJUANA IS EINT INEBRIATING, AND ALCOHOS NOT. THAT'S FALSE. SIMPLE TASKS DONE WITH LESS ACCURACY AFTER ONE ALCOHOLIC DRINK. AND MARINOL IS THE SYNTHETIC VERSION OF THC, AND STRAIGHT FROM THE FDA'S WEBSITE, AND AS S OPPOSED, DON'T DO THAT UNTIL YOU ARE AWARE OF HOW THIS DRUG AFFECTS YOU. AGAIN, I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO PASS THIS PROPOSAL. I THINK THAT THERE IS SERIOUS POTENTIAL TO SIMULATE A NEW CULTURE IN THESE DESIGNATED CONSUMPTION SITES. THANK YOU H VERY MUCH.
02:39:34.350: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING?
02:39:49.799: >> GOOD EVENING, MY NAME IS TYESHA MONIGU. AND I'M HERE TO ASK THAT YOU SUPPORT THE AMENDMENT FOR THE SOCIAL USE. I THINK THAT IT IS DEFINITELY A SAFE ENVIRONMENT. IT'S A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE CANNOT ONLY MEDICATE BUT THEY CAN EDUCATE AND TEACH ONE ANOTHER. IT'S A HEALs SPACE AND IT'S PEOPLE THAT WOULD NORMALLY BE INTRO VERTS. I THINK IT WOULD BE MORE COMFORTABLE OF PEOPLE OF THEIR CONSTITUENCY. ALSO THE FACT THAT PEOPLE CAN'T MEDICATE IN THEIR HOMES. THE RENTAL PROPERTIES AND THE APARTMENT PEOPLE HAVE AN ISSUE WITH BEING ABLE TO MEDICATE SAFELY. SO, AGAIN, I JUST ASK THAT YOU SUPPORT THAT. THANK YOU.
02:40:39.882: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. IS THIS ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING? SEEING NO ONE, THIS PUBLIC HEARING IS CLOSED. PUBLIC HEARING NUMBER SIX. AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND THE TITLE OF ALL SECTIONS OF AND TO ADD A NEW SECTION 7:613 TO CHAPTER 96 (MEDICAL MARIJUANA FACILITIES) OF TITLE VII OF THE CODE OF THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR . IS THERE ANYONE WOULD WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK -- WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING?
02:41:13.249: >> DIANE GINOLA, THE 4th WARD. I WANTED TO ADD A FOLLOW-UP ON SOMETHING -- THAT SOMEONE SAID ABOUT THE MEDICAL MARIJUANA CAFES. IT'S NOT LEGAL TO HAVE I IN FOOD, OR ANY DRINK AND ALL EMPLOYEES TO HAVE STAY IN A SEPARATE ROOM THAN THE SMOKE ROOM. BASICALLY WHAT YOU WILL BE APPROVING IS A SMOKE ROOM. IT'S DREAMING TO SAY THAT WE WILL HAVE THESE LITTLE CAFES AND PATIOS AND ALL OF THESE OTHER THINGS THAT PEOPLE ARE DREAMING FOR, AND MAYBE IN THE FUTURE, BUT RIGHT NOW, WHAT YOU WILL BE APPROVING IS A ROOM WHERE PEOPLE CAN SILT AND SMOKE WITHOUT FOOD, WITHOUT DRINK, AND THE EMPLOYEES WHO ARE SUPERVISING HAVE TO BE IN ANOTHER ROOM. IT'S PLAIN AS DAY IN THE MEDICAL MARIJUANA ACT. I JUST WANTED TO GET THAT CLARIFIED. THANK YOU.
02:41:56.125: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
02:42:01.998: >> GOOD EVENING, ONCE AGAIN. I'M SURE IT'S A SURPRISE TO NO ONE, I'M BACK UP HERE. BRIAN FENNIC, 4th WARD. SPEAKING JUST TO THIS ISSUE, ITSELF, AND I'M GOING TO SPEAK ABOUT THE LANGUAGE. ORDINANCE, IN TERMS OF THE -- WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT CONSUMPTION FACILITIES, IF THERE IS A DISCUSSION ABOUT DISTANCES FROM DAY CARE CENTERS AND THINGS OF NATURE, WE HOPE IT WOULD BE CONSTRAINED TO THAT ONE ISSUE AND LOSING FAITH BECAUSE THE ISSUE OF DISTANCES FROM PROVISIONING CENTERS HAS BEEN LITIGATED ONE TIME BEFORE THIS BODY, AND NOTHING HAS CHANGED SINCE THEN AND NO NEGATIVE IMPACT HAS BEEN NOTICED BY THE COMMITTEE. WE HOPE YOU LIMIT IT TO THAT ASPECT OF THE ORDINANCE ALONE. AND I WOULD JUST -- AS TO THE OTHER ISSUE, AGAIN, WHEN WE ARE SPEAKING OF A CAP, ON ALL OF THE -- ON THE THREE DIFFERENT PERMITTING TYPES, SOME PEOPLE MAY ARGUE AGAINST CAPS AND THAT'S BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, THEY HAVE AN AGENDA AND THEY REPRESENT THEIR CLIENTS' AGENDA AND THEY BENEFIT FROM A RESTRICTED ENVIRONMENT, BUT THIS BODY REPRESENTS THIS COMMUNITY'S AGENDA, AND THE COMMUNITY DOES NOT BENEFIT FROM A RESTRICTED ENVIRONMENT LIKE THAT AND A REF STRICTED MARKET -- AND A RESTRICTED MARK. RESTRICTED MARKET. THANK YOU.
02:43:30.086: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WOULD WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING? SEEING NO ONE, THIS PUBLIC HEARING IS CLOSED. LET'S TAKE A SHORT BREAK. [ BREAK ]
02:57:15.342: >> Mayor Taylor: WE'RE BACK AFTER A SHORT BREAK. A1, WE HAVE BEFORE THE WORK SESSION MINUTES OF SEPTEMBER 9, THE SPECIAL WORK SESSION OF SEPTEMBER 12 AND THE REGULAR SESSION MEETING MINUTES OF SEPTEMBER 16th, 2019. MAY I HAVE A MOTION TO APPROVE THESE UM ITS, MOVED BY SMITH AND SECONDED BY RAMLAWI. DISCUSSION OF THE MINUTES. ALL IN FAVOR. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. ORDINANCES SECOND READING. AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND CHAPTER 55 (ZONING), REZONING OF 0.54 ACRE FROM PUD (PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT) TO PUD (PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT), THE GLEN MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT PUD ZONING AND SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS, 201, 213, 215, 217 GLEN AVENUE AND 1025 EAST ANN STREET. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN. DISCUSSION OF B-1. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
02:58:08.964: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: START ON A POSITIVE NOTE, JUST THANKING THE DEVELOPERS AND THE OWNERSHIP FOR COMING BACK AND GOING THROUGH THIS PROCESS. HOPEFULLY, YOU KNOW, WHEN THIS IS UP AND RUNNING, THEY WILL BE BACK TO DO ANOTHER BECAUSE THEY JUST GET NOTHING BUT GLOWING REVIEWS. IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE THAT. THANKS AGAIN AND SORRY THAT YOU HAD TO COME BACK AND DELAY THE PROJECT, BUT HOPEFULLY THIS IS THE LAST TIME.
02:58:37.425: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED. IT'S APPROVED. B-2 RESOLUTION TO APPROVE THE GLEN MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT MODIFIED AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND CHAPTER 55 (ZONING), REZONING OF 7.7 ACRES FROM R1E (SINGLE-FAMILY DWELLING DISTRICT) WITH CONDITIONS TO PUD (PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT), WEBER REZONING, 2857 PACKARD ROAD. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRAND, AND SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD. DISCUSSION OF B-2. COUNCILMEMBER MANNISTER. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, DID YOU WANT TO GO FIRST?
02:59:16.298: >> Councilmember Bannister: OKAY. WELL, I TAKE MY OATH OF OFFICE VERY SERIOUSLY AND THE H PUBLIC TRUST VERY SERIOUS AND OUR ROLE, AND VOTING NO ON THIS PUD WAS A CLEAR NO-BRAINER FOR ME. I'M REMINDED OF THE NATIVE AMERICAN PROVERB THAT HE WITH DON'T INHERIT THE EARTH BUT WE BORROW IT FROM THE CHILDREN. AND WHILE THE COLLINS HOUSE FROM 1849, THAT THIS NEIGHBORHOOD CRYSTALLIZED AROUND, IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME, FOR MY COMMENTS RIGHT NOW, I WILL FOCUS ON THE LACK OF THE TANGIBLE PUBLIC BENEFITS AND OF THE PUD PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO THE LOSS OF THESE EXTREMELY RARE, NATURAL FEATURES IN THE TREES. I WANT TO THANK THE DEVELOPER AND I WANT TO THANK STAFF AND THE NEIGHBORS FOR ALL WORKING ON, THIS FOR THE THREE YEARS. I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE NEIGHBORS FOR SCURRYING AROUND TO GET AN EIGHT-VOTE SUPER MAJORITY REQUIREMENT ON THIS. AND THE 24 WHO CAME OUT TONIGHT, INCLUDING THE TWO WHO SAID NO TO THE PROJECT, WHICH WAS ONE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE AND ONE DEVELOPER. SO I SERVE ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION, AND WE TALK A LOT ABOUT THE CLIMATE CRISIS AND AS WE KNOW, WASHTENAW COUNTY ON SEPTEMBER 18 ALREADY DECLARED A CLIMATE EMERGENCY AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION DISCUSSED IT AT OUR LAST MEET AND WE WILL DO IT AGAIN ON OCTOBER 24th AT 7:00. A CLIMATE CRISIS INVOLVES DECLARING NET ZERO CARBON EMISSIONS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. AND TREES AND THESE SUPERTREES AS RITA MITCHELL SAID -- REMINDED US ARE THE LUNGS OF THE PLANET. THEY DO A HUGE JOB WITH CARBON SEQUESTRATION. THEY ALSO HELP US WITH MITIGATION OF HEAT ISLANDS AND PROTECTION OF OUR STORMWATER AND DRAINAGE SYSTEMS. THEY MENTIONED MALIK'S CREEK AND SEWAGE OVERFLOW AND WE ALSO LEARNED ABOUT PYTO REMEDIATION. THEY SUCK THINGS OUT OF THE GROUND AND THEY GATHER UP CHEMICALS IN THE GROUND FOR US. I FIND IT JUST INTOLERABLY IRONIC THAT OUR CITY'S CORE VALUES ARE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY AND STEWARDSHIP. I WEAR THE BURR OAK LAPEL PIN THAT MAYOR DALEY GAVE TO ME ALMOST DAILY AND EVERYWHERE I GO, PEOPLE LOVE IT, AND THEY WANT ONE. I MEAN, IT'S -- THIS IS -- THESE ARE OUR CORE VALUES.
03:02:28.490: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER, THREE MINUTES.
03:02:29.591: >> Councilmember Bannister: OKAY. YOU KNOW, I HAVE TALKED WITH STATE REPS ABOUT THIS PROBLEM, AND THEY SUGGESTED -- AND I'M WILLING TO HELP THE DEVELOPER PULL OUT ALL THE STOPS AND FIND A BETTER PLACE FOR THESE 51 NEW HOUSING UNITS. PERHAPS AROUND BRIA BRIARWOOD M, WHERE WE ALREADY HAVE A PAVED PARADISE. TREESARE HABITATS FOR BIRDS AND WILDLIFE.
03:02:57.418: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER.
03:02:58.086: >> Councilmember Bannister: JUST IN CLOSING, I THOUGHT THAT WAS AN INTERESTING POINT THAT WE PAID $400,000 IN 2014 TO MOVE JUST ONE OF THESE BURR OAKS AND HERE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A STAND OF 57 BURR OAKS.
03:03:15.403: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
03:03:18.006: >> Councilmember Lumm: COUNCILMO ADDRESS BOTH THE ZONING AND THE SITE PLAN WITH ONE -- YOU KNOW, ADDRESS OF US ALL, PERHAPS SHE COULD SPEAK A LITTLE BIT LONGER, JUST A THOUGHT. MY COMMENTS WILL ADDRESS BOTH THE ZONING AND SITE PLAN.
03:03:36.758: >> Mayor Taylor: WELL, WE --
03:03:38.159: >> Councilmember Lumm: I WON'T SPEAK TWICE. DID YOU WANT TO --
03:03:42.697: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
03:03:46.234: >> Councilmember Lumm: OH, I -- DID YOU -- OKAY, I WILL MAKE MY COMMENTS FOR BOTH THE ZONING AND THE SITE PLAN, IF I MAY CONTINUE THEN. I WAS JUST MAKING A LITTLE PITCH FOR MY COLLEAGUE OVER HERE.
03:03:56.711: >> Mayor Taylor: WE'RE TRYING TO STICK WITH THE THREE-MINUTE TIME FRAME. SHE HAD HER THREE MINUTES WHICH EXTENDS AND THEN YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
03:04:05.420: >> Councilmember Lumm: MY COMMENTS ARE FOR THE ZONING AND THE SITE PLAN SO I WON'T USE SIX MINUTES, IF YOU WILL. AND I -- I WILL JUST START OUT BY SAYING -- WELL, FIRST, THANK YOU, EVERYONE, FOR COMING OUT. THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR VARIOUS EMAILS AND APPRECIATE ALL THE HELPFUL INPUT THAT YOU HAVE PROVIDED US. OBVIOUSLY THIS IMPACTS YOU DIRECTLY. MOST OF YOU HERE TONIGHT AND SO WE UNDERSTAND WHY THIS IS SUCH A SIGNIFICANT -- YOU KNOW, WE REPRESENTED DRAMATIC CHANGE TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD. THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT. AND MS. RANSBERG ALSO THANK YOU FOR COMING OUT AND FOR EDUCATING US ABOUT THE VALUE OF THIS 1850s GREEK REVIVAL HOME. THE -- THE -- WE HAVE HEARD YOUR APPEALS TO US, AND YOUR WELL-OR TICK LATED ARGUMENTS. I CONTINUE SO HAVE MIXED FEELINGS ON THIS AND I ALSO LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING MY FELLOW COUNCILMEMBER'S VIEWS ON THIS. AT FIRST READING, I HAD MIXED FEELINGS ON THIS PROPOSAL. I'M BEING HONEST. I STILL DO. THE -- I DO ANY THAT THE PLANNING COMMISSION AND THE CITY COUNCIL'S REJECTION OF THE ORIGINAL ZONING AND PLAN IN THE FALL OF 2017 WAS APPROPRIATE AT THE ADVERSE NATURAL FEATURES IMPACT OF THAT PLAN WERE MORE DEVASTATING AS YOU ALL APPRECIATE THAT THEY NEEDED TO BE AS EVIDENCED BY THE FACT THAT THEY WERE CONSIDERING A REVISED PLAN THAT KEEPS THE SAME NUMBER OF UNITS WITH RESPECT TO THE NATURAL FEATURE. STILL DAMAGE NONETHELESS. AS WE ALL KNOW, WE KNOW THE SEQUENCE OF ALL OF THIS FOLLOWING THAT ORIGINAL DENIAL, THE DEVELOPER SUED THE CITY AND THEN COUNCIL UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED THE RESOLUTION TO STAY THE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS SO WE COULD CONSIDER A NEW PLAN. AT THE TIME, THE EXPECTATION, I THINK MANY OF US HAD WAS THAT THE REVISED PROPOSAL WOULD BE PUD ZONING WITH THE SAME NUMBER OF UNITS. THIS IS -- BUT LESS NATURAL FEATURES DAMAGE. THAT'S KIND OF WHAT WE GOT BEFORE US. PUD ZONING, CHI T WHICH I THINKS MORE APPROPRIATE. AND SITE PLAN WHICH IS AN IMPROVEMENT, BUT THE $64,000, THAT'S NOT MUCH MONEY THESE DAYS, WHEN WE USED TO SAY $64,000 QUESTION, I GUESS. ANYWAY, THE BIG QUESTION IS WHETHER OR NOT THIS IMPROVEMENT WARRANTS APPROVAL OBVIOUSLY AND THE STAFF AND THE PLANNING COMMISSION BELIEVE THAT IT PARENTS APPROVAL. PUT AS WE HAVE HEARD FROM ALL OF YOU HAVE TONIGHT, AND OVER THE COURSE OF MANY WEEKS, THERE ARE SERIOUS AND LEGITIMATE CONCERNS THAT ARE NOT SURPRISING OR UNFOUNDED AT ALL, WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT THE PROJECT WILL, AGAIN, DRAMATICALLY CHANGE THE LONG STANDING CHARACTER OF YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD AND THAT CAN'T EVER BE TAKEN LIGHTLY. NONE OF US. WE KNOW THAT THE NATURAL FEATURES, THE ADVERSE IMPACTS ARE REVERSED. THEY ARE STILL SIGNIFICANT. THE ORIGINAL PLAN ESSENTIALLY REMOVED ALL THE HIGH QUALITY FEATURES.
03:07:20.748: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER THREE MINUTES.
03:07:22.383: >> Councilmember Lumm: OKAY. THIS IS FOR ZONING AND SITE PLAN. I WON'T RAISE MY HAND AGAIN. YOU WON'T H HEAR ANOTHER PEEP FM ME ON THIS ISSUE. [ LAUGHTER ] OKAY, I WILL WRAP UP. YEAH, AND I DO WANT TO HEAR FROM MY COLLEAGUES. YOU KNOW, IT'S BEEN STATED THAT -- IT'S BEEN NOTED THAT THE CONSTRUCTION WILL LIKELY THREATEN THE CRITICAL ROOT ZONE FOR THE REMAINING TREES AND THAT'S CERTAINLY POSSIBLE. I SAW IT WITH THE GEDDES AVE PROJECT, AND NICE, BIG OLD TREES AND THEY DIDN'T MAKE IT. SO THE SHEER SIZE OF THIS DEVELOPMENT AND PROPERTY, IT'S EIGHT ACRES, 50 UNITS, AGAIN, WE'LL CHANGE THE CHARACTER OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD. THAT'S A HUGE CONCERN AS WE HAVE HEARD AND SO IS TRAFFIC. SO LASTLY, I WOULD LIKE TO TOUCH ON THE 1850s VINTAGE GREEK REVIVAL HOUSE ON THE PROPERTY AND THE OUT BUILDINGS AS WELL. WE HAVE RECEIVED SEVERAL COMMUNICATIONS ABOUT THE HISTORIC NATURE OF -- AND SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS PROPERTY. AND I WILL JUST SAY THAT I WAS PLEASED AND I APPRECIATE THAT THE DEVELOPER AGREED TO THIS, THAT THE DEVELOPER CAN'T BEGIN THE DEMOLITION REMOVAL OR SALVAGE OF THE HOUSE UNTIL APRIE ISSUANCE OF THE GRADING PERMIT. THAT THAT PROVIDES SIX MONTHS OF STEADY ALTERNATIVES. SO THANK YOU FOR WORKING THAT OUT FOR US, CITY ATTORNEY. I THINK IT WAS NICING TO CREATE AN HISTORIC DISTRICT COVERAGE OR ADOPT A MORATORIUM BUT APPARENTLY, YOU KNOW, IT -- IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE. THOSE AREN'T APPROPRIATE MECHANISMS IN THIS INSTANCE. BUT -- SO I -- SO I AM GRATEFUL AND ENCOURAGED THAT WE HAVE TIME TO PURSUE SOME OTHER OPTIONS. SO, YOU KNOW, HOPEFULLY THAT REGARD, A PLAN CAN BE DEVELOPED. THANKS.
03:09:30.711: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
03:09:31.612: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR AND THANK YOU TO ALL THE RESIDENTS WHO HAVE BEEN ENGAGED FOR THREE YEARS. THIS IS A PROJECT THAT HAS KEPT ME TORN FOR THREE YEARS. AS WE THINK ABOUT ISSUES IN THE WARD THAT KEEP YOU UP, THIS IS ONE THAT JUST WON'T STOP. AND SO AS I THINK THROUGH HOW WE GOT HERE, YOU KNOW, IT -- I HAVE VOTED FOR THIS DEVELOPMENT AT TIMES AND AGAINST IT MOST RECENTLY A MONTH AGO AGAINST IT AT THE PLANNING COMMISSION. AND FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT WHEN THIS PROCESS -- THIS LATEST PROCESS BEGAN WITH THE PUD, STAFF SAID TO ME, VOTE ON IT HOW YOU WOULD WITH ANY PUD. AND THE ONLY PUBLIC BENEFIT OF TANGIBLE VALUE THAT THIS COMMUNITY IS GETTING OUT OF THE PUD TODAY IS THE IMPROVED STORMWATER. I TRUST OUR STAFF'S REVIEW OF THE ENGINEERING DRAWINGS THAT THIS WILL POSITIVELY IMPACT FLOODING TO THE PROPERTIES TO THE NORTH AND THE EAST, BUT THAT'S ONE SMALL -- THAT'S ONE SMALL PUBLIC BENEFIT. BUT IN MY -- AND THIS IS NOW AN EIGHT VOTE ITEM, WHICH I COMMEND RESIDENTS FOR ACHIEVING. IT'S DIFFICULT TO GET EIGHT VOTES ON ANYTHING. AND IF I WERE A BETTING PERSON AND UNTO THE NATALIE THIS ITEM REQUIRES -- UNFORTUNATELY THIS ITEM REQUIRES ME TO BE A BETTING PERSON. IT WOULD BE EXPEDIENT FOR ME TO VOTE NO, BUT I WILL BE VOTING YES. I WILL VOTE YES FOR THE VERY SPECIFIC REASON THAT I'M AFRAID OF THE CLEAR CUTTING. I'M POINT-BLANK AFRAID OF THE CLEAR CUTTING. I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE LAWSUIT. I TRUST THAT WE WOULD WIN THE LAWSUIT. I TRUST THAT THE CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE AND MR. McDONALD REPRESENTING THEM WOULD WIN THIS LAWSUIT, BUT WE WOULDN'T WIN THE LAWSUIT IF THIS PROPERTY WERE CLEAR CUT, AND IT DOESN'T EVEN NEED TO BE CLEAR CUT. IT COULD BE A CORNER, WHERE THE IMPACTED NATURAL FEATURES ARE AND IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE MR. HEISSLER WHO DOES IT OR MR. WEBER. THERE ARE TWO PARTIES AND MULTIPLE OPPORTUNITIES TO GIVE THEM THE OUT. THAT'S A LOT OF RISK TO ABSORB AS A Z DECISION MAKER. AND WHILE IT WOULD BE POLITICALLY EXPEDIENT TO VOTE NO, WHILE IT WOULD BE EASIER TO VOTE NO PERSONALLY, IF THIS FAILS AND THIS PROPERTY IS CLEAR CUT OR A PORTION OF THESE TREES ARE CLEAR CUT AND I DIDN'T VOTE NO, I WOULD -- I WOULD NOT BE OKAY WITH MYSELF. AND THAT'S A REALLY TOUGH PLACE TO BE. AND I GUESS I WILL LEAVE IT THERE FOR NOW. THERE ARE A LOT OF DETAILS TO DISCUSS AND I WILL DO THAT IN THE NEXT, BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE REZONING, THAT'S THE UNFORTUNATE REALITY OF WHERE WE ARE.
03:12:34.095: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
03:12:36.330: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. AND ALSO I WANT TO EXTEND MY THANKS TO THE RESIDENTS FOR COMING OUT AND WRITING AND I KNOW I RESPONDED TO SOME OF YOU, BUT NOT ALL OF YOU. I WILL GET BACK TO ALL OF YOU AS SOON AS I CAN. THIS -- SINCE WE ARE SPEAKING TO THE ZONING AND THE REZONING QUESTION HERE, I WILL FOCUS ON THAT AND THE FACT THAT IT NEEDS EIGHT VOTES, I WENT BACK AND LOOKED AT THE MEETING IN DECEMBER 19th, 2016, WHERE IT ALSO NEEDED EIGHT VOTES TO GET THIS REZONING IN THE FIRST PLACE AND IT KIND OF GOT OVER THE EIGHT VOTE HURDLES IN A WAY THAT MAKES THOSE OF US ON THIS SIDE OF THE TABLE UNCOMFORTABLE. IT ACHIEVED THE EIGHT VOTE MARGIN AND, HONESTLY, I WILL BE REAL FRANK ABOUT IT. YOU KNOW THAT EIGHT VOTE CAME FROM AN APPOINTED COUNCILMEMBER, NOT AN ELECTED COUNCILMEMBER WHO SAT IN THIS SEAT HERE NEXT TO ME. AND, YOU KNOW, THAT PLAYED ITSELF OUT ALL OVER OUR CITY FOR THAT HANDFUL OF MONTHS THAT THAT PERSON SAT IN THAT SEAT. AND I'M NOT SO SURE THAT THE PERSON WHO SAT IN THAT SEAT PRIOR TO THAT APPOINTED COUNCILMEMBER WOULD HAVE GONE FOR R1E AND SO R1E WAS JUST AN INAPPROPRIATE ZONE, REZONING FOR THIS AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED AND I DON'T LIKE THE IDEA OF USING PUD AS A WORKAROUND TO GET WHAT WE WANT IN THIS AREA. THAT'S NOT WHAT IT'S FOR. PUD IS DESIGNED TO CREATE BENEFITS FOR THE PUBLIC. AND AS COUNCIL MEMBER ACKERMAN REPORTS, THE BENEFITS ARE PRETTY LIMITED IN THIS CASE BUT THERE ARE SOME. WE HAVE SEEN SOME. AND IT STILL SEEMS WRONG TO ME SOMEHOW TO -- TO TAKE IT DOWN THAT ROAD. NOW A PUD IS MUCH BETTER THAN THE R1E THAT SITS THERE ON THE CURRENT PLAN. AND THE PUD COMES TO US WITH A SITE PLAN. WE CAN ACCEPT THE IDEA THAT R1E IS NOT APPROPRIATE AND THE PUD IS SOMEWHAT BETTER AND CONTINUE TO REJECT THE SITE PLAN. AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE THAT'S HOW IT WILL GO DOWN BUT IT REEKS OF A PREVIOUS PROBLEM THAT THIS COUNCIL HAD WHERE IN MY OPINION THEY HAD AN OVER APPROVED ZONING AND THAT WAS THE CITY PLACE PROJECT WHERE FIVE GREAT HISTORIC HOMES WERE TORN DOWN ON 4th AVENUE THERE. AND SO IT WAS JUST -- IT'S A PROBLEM, AND IT'S GOT US IN A STRANGE POSITION HERE. LIKE I SAY, I MEAN THE IDEA THAT THIS -- I BELIEVE IT WAS RIGHTLY REJECTED THE SITE PLAN, EVEN THOUGH IT WAS ZONED R1E, I BELIEVE THE SITE PLAN WAS RIGHTLY REJECTED FOR A MICHIGAN CENTENNIAL FARM WITH A STAND OF HISTORIC TREES. I'M NOT SURE HOW I WILL VOTE. I HAVE THE GOOD OR BAD FORTUNE, DEPENDING HOW YOU LOOK AT, IT GOING LAST TODAY. I DON'T LIKE IT AND I APPRECIATE THE RESIDENTS' CONCERNS AND I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO SPEAK UP, TO SPEAK UP TO THIS BODY WHICH IS A NEW BODY, AND SAY THAT THIS IS TOO DENSE. IT'S NOT WHAT YOU WANT AND IT'S RUINING THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD. IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO RUIN THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD AND THAT MEANS SOMETHING TO ME. I THINK THAT MEANS SOMETHING TO MY COLLEAGUES. AND SO I THANK THEM FOR PROPERLY REJECTING THE PREVIOUS -- THE PREVIOUS SITE PLAN.
03:16:08.442: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER EATEN.
03:16:09.443: >> Councilmember Eaton: THANK YOU. I REALLY STRUGGLED WITH THIS PARTICULAR REZONING REQUEST. I SHARE THE FEAR OF THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF MAKING THE DECISIONS HERE MIGHT BE THE CLEAR CUTTING OF THIS PROPERTY. AND YET, THAT'S NOT THE QUESTION THAT'S REALLY BEFORE US. THE QUESTION BEFORE US IS WHETHER REZONING THIS PROPERTY TO A PUD FITS OUR PUD ORDINANCE. AND AS COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN POINTED OUT, THERE ISN'T MUCH PUBLIC BENEFIT PROVIDED BY THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT. WE'LL SAVE 17, PERHAPS, IF NOTHING HAPPENS TO THE ROOT SYSTEM OF THE 17 SURVIVING TREES. 17 TREES. AND WE'RE GOING TO GET A STORMWATER SYSTEM THAT ACTUALLY EVERY DEVELOPER IS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE AN ADEQUATE STORMWATER SYSTEM THAT PREVENTS THE DEVELOPMENT FROM HAVING AN IMPACT OF SURROUNDING PROPERTIES. I'M NOT SURE THAT THAT EVEN COUNTS AS A REAL PUBLIC BENEFIT. IF YOU NEED TO DO IT ANYWAYS, BECAUSE OF THE -- THE EXTREME DEVELOPMENT THAT YOU ARE PLACING ON THE PROPERTY. SO FOR ME, THE QUESTION COMES DOWN TO WHETHER OR NOT THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL PROVIDES US WITH THE KINDS OF PUBLIC BENEFIT THAT ARE PUD ORDINANCE ASKS OF A DEVELOPER, AND IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE THAT THRESHOLD FOR ME. SO I WILL BE VOTING KNOW ON THIS, AND I HOPE THAT OTHER COUNCILMEMBERS WILL FOLLOW UNITE. SUIT. THANK YOU.
03:18:10.130: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
03:18:10.998: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANKS TO ALL THE PEOPLE WHO CAME OUT TONIGHT AND LAST NIGHT AT CAUCUS. WE HEARD THE PASSIONATE PLEAS OF WHAT OUR TRUE FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITIES ARE. YOU KNOW, MANY OF US, AT LEAST FOUR OF US HERE WERE NOT HERE WHEN THIS WAS REZONED INITIALLY WHICH MANY HAVE DESCRIBED AS A MISTAKE AND SO WE ARE INHERITING A MESS AND WE HAD TO COME UP TO SPEED QUICK ON THE FACTS OF THE MATTER AND THE OPTIONS AND WHAT SOME HAVE DESCRIBED AS BLACKMAIL WHEN IT COMES TO WHAT OUR OPTIONS ARE IF WE DON'T GO ALONG WITH THE PRESCRIBED PUD. I HAVE CONCERNS JUST LIKE MY COLLEAGUES HAVE OUTLINED. THE PUD SHOULD PROVIDE PUBLIC BENEFIT AND I FRANKLY DON'T SEE A WHOLE LOT OF IT. SAVING A FEW TREES AND AVOIDING THE WORST CASE SCENARIO, I GUESS WOULD BE THE PUBLIC BENEFIT. THE STORMWATER ISSUE, THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT ANY RESPONSIBLE DEVELOPMENT WOULD HAVE TO BE -- WOULD HAVE TO BE DONE WITH ANY RESPONSIBLE DEVELOPMENT. SO I DON'T SEE THAT AS SOME SORT OF HUGE PUBLIC BENEFIT. I JUST, AGAIN, HAVE CONCERNS ON THIS. I DON'T THINK IT'S WHAT THE PUD IS DESIGNED FOR AND I KNOW WHY IT WAS USED IN THIS CASE, BUT I WILL RESERVE THE REST OF MY TIME AND IF I DO NEED TO SPEAK ON IT AGAIN. BUT IT DOES NOT REACH THE LEVEL OF PUBLIC BENEFIT THAT I THINK NECESNECESSITATES SOMETHING THAS A STRONG OPPOSITION OF THE LOCAL RESIDENTS, WHEN YOU HAVE 80% OF THE AREA RESIDENTS PETITIONING AGAINST IT. THAT JUST SPEAKS VOLUMES. AND I SAID I WOULD STOP BUT I NOTICE I STILL HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME. YOU KNOW, MANY PEOPLE HAVE CHALLENGED US THAT WE ARE NOT LISTENING TO THEM, WE ARE PUSHED AROUND, WE ARE WEAK. I DON'T -- I DON'T KNOW IF THOSE FOLKS HAVE BEEN WATCHING THIS COUNCIL FOR THE LAST EIGHT OR NINE MONTHS. THAT'S NOT WHAT I WOULD DESCRIBE THIS COUNCIL AS. YOU CAN DESCRIBE IT AS A LOT OF THINGS, BUT THAT'S NOT HOW I WOULD DESCRIBE US. SO THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE IS BEING HEARD. AND ALLOW IT TO WORK.
03:20:55.829: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
03:20:59.566: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES, I MADE A SIMILAR STATEMENT LAST NIGHT, AND SOME OF MY GUIDING PRINCIPLES ARE SUSTAINABILITY AND DENSITY. WE HAVE AGREED TO THAT. BUT I THINK -- AND WE'RE LOOKING AT OUR MASTER PLAN RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THAT CONCEPT OF FILLING IN THE FREEWAY RING AND THAT'S NOT SMART DENSITY. WHAT SMART DENSITY IS, IS MORE LIKE OUR TRANSIT CORRIDOR PLAN. WE NEED MAXIMUM DENSITY DOWNTOWN AND WE NEED MAXIMUM DENSITY ON SOME OF THESE MAJOR ROADS, LIKE SOUTH STATE STREET, LIKE, WASHTENAW. WHAT I SEE HAPPENING IS NOT ANY BENEFIT AT ALL FROM THIS DEVELOPMENT, BUT IT'S A NET MINUS BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SPRAWL. IF YOU BUILD $400,000 UNITS, THOSE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO DRIVE AND WE CAN SAY DENSITY IS GOOD, AND WE'RE GOING TO INCREASE MASS TRANSIT, BUT THAT WILL NOT HAPPEN AS A RESULT OF THIS UNIT. WE NEED TRANSIT CORRIDORS AND SO I APOLOGIZE TO THE DEVELOPER AND I HOPE THAT THERE WILL BE SOME LESSONS LEARNED BECAUSE A THREE-YEAR PROCESS IS WAY TOO LONG. THANK YOU.
03:22:24.451: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
03:22:26.253: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THE PASSION AND THE ORGANIZATION AND THE COMMUNITY THAT SHOWN BY THE RESIDENTS. I WOULD ALSO BE REALLY INTELLECTUALLY AND MORALLY DISHONEST TO SAY THAT I THINK -- I KNOW IT'S AN UNPOPULAR OPINION HERE, BUT I DON'T THINK THE REZONING WAS A MISTAKE. I THINK THE RESPONSE FROM THE DEVELOPER TO THE REZONING WAS A MISTAKE WHICH IS WHY WE REJECTED THAT SITE PLAN. WHEN WE WENT TO R1E, WHAT I HEARD FROM RESIDENTS WAS WE DON'T WANT BIG HOUSES AND WE WANT AS MANY TREES AS POSSIBLE. THAT'S WHAT I HEARD OVER AND OVER AGAIN. SO I THOUGHT IN EXCHANGE FOR A FEW ADDITIONAL UNITS IT MADE SENSE TO MAKE THE HOUSES SMALLER BECAUSE I ALSO THOUGHT IT WOULD MAKE THEM MORE AFFORDABLE. THAT WAS NOT THE SITE PLAN THAT WE WERE GIVEN. WE WERE GIVEN ONE THAT TOOK A LOT OF TREES AND I GLADLY REJECTED THAT SITE PLAN AND IT WAS UNANIMOUS. SO THIS WASN'T A COUNCIL THAT -- THAT JUST DIDN'T GIVE ANY THOUGHT TO WHAT -- TO WHAT CAME FORWARD. IT WAS -- IT WAS A THOUGHTFUL DECISION. GOING FORWARD AND HAVING THIS LAWSUIT, IT BECAME REALLY CLEAR FROM ALL ALONG THAT THE THREAT WAS VERY REAL OF TAKING DOWN ALL OF THESE TREES AND WHAT I HEARD FROM NEIGHBORS IS, YES, YOU DON'T LIKE THE DENSITY. YES, YOU WANT DIFFERENT DEVELOPMENT, BUT THE TRUTH IS, IS THAT WE DON'T GET TO DESIGN DEVELOPMENT ON LAND THAT WE DON'T OWN. WE MIGHT WISH THAT WE COULD, BUT WE DON'T. AND SO INSTEAD, WHAT I VIEW MY JOB AS A COUNCILMEMBER IS TO LISTEN TO WHAT THE TOP PRIORITIES ARE AND I CONTINUE TO HEAR TREES. I CAN'T LIVE WITH MYSELF, VOTING, YOU KNOW, ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT THIS COUNCIL DID VOTE UNANIMOUSLY TO HAVE THIS COMBACK AS A PUD. WE ASKED FOR THIS. THIS IS WHAT WE UNANIMOUSLY ASK FOR AS A BODY. AND I THINK IT'S -- IT WOULD JUST -- IT WOULD BE DISHONEST OF ME TO ASK FOR IT AND THEN REJECT IT. EVEN THOUGH I UNDERSTAND THAT -- THAT THERE'S A LOT OF REALLY GOOD INTENT BEHIND WANTING TO KEEP YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD -- YOU KNOW, WANTING TO KEEP THE THINGS THAT YOU LOVE ABOUT YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD. SO I DON'T EXPECT THAT THIS IS GOING TO PASS, LIKE COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN, I THINK IT WOULD BE EASIER FOR ME TO VOTE NO AND SAY I'M FIGHTING FOR YOU BUT IT WOULD GO AGAINST MANY OF THE THINGS THAT I SAID I BELIEVE IN IN TERMS OF PROCESS, IN TERMS OF SPEAKING HONESTLY ABOUT THINGS I SAID I SUPPORTED, ABOUT SUPPORTING HOUSING WITHIN THE CITY, ABOUT SUPPORTING DIFFERENT HOUSING TYPES WITHIN THE CITY, AND I THINK THIS PLAN IS ACTUALLY -- WE'LL TALK WITH THE SITE PLAN LATER, BUT IT'S ACTUALLY -- IN TERMS OF HOUSING TYPE, A HORRIBLE PLAN AND WHAT IT DOES GIVE US IN TERMS OF BENEFIT IS TREES.
03:25:41.648: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER.
03:25:42.315: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. AND SO I CAN'T HAVE THAT ON MY CONSCIENCE TO VOTE NO IF THEY COME IN AND BULLDOZE THAT HOUSE AND CUT DOWN ALL OF THOSE TREES.
03:25:50.957: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? I WOULD LIKE TO TOUCH UPON A COUPLE OF THINGS WITH RESPECT TO THE R1E ZONING, I WOULD LIKE TO ECHO WHAT COUNCILMEMBER GRAND SAID THAT. WAS THE SOLUTION TO THE STATED NEIGHBORHOOD PROBLEM, THE PROBLEMS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED WAS THAT THERE WOULD BE McMANSIONS NEXT DOOR, BUFFERED RIGHT NEXT TO THE ADJACENT PROPERTIES AND THAT THEY NEED -- THAT FOLKS WANTED HELP. THE R1E ZONING WAS THE SOLUTION. THAT IS TO SAY, IT ADDED FIVE UNITS, SMALLER SQUARE FOOTAGE, AND ADDED VEGETABLE BUFFERING AND ADDITIONAL SETBACKS FROM ADJACENT PROPERTIES. MY CONCERN AS HAS BEEN STATED, I DON'T BELIEVE THE LAWSUIT TO BE LEVERAGED, I BELIEVE THE LEVERAGE IS THE TREES. AS WE KNOW THE PROPERTY OWNER -- NOT THE DEVELOPER. PERHAPS THEY DO. EITHER THE PROPERTY OWNER OR THE DEVELOPER HAS THE RIGHT TO CLEAR CUT THE PROPERTY PRESENTLY. THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO CLEAR CUT THE PROPERTY AND THEN RESUBMIT AN R1E, WHICH WOULD BE BY RIGHT, OBLIGATING US TO ACCEPT IT. AND THAT, I TAKE -- THAT'S A CONCERN AND A RISK I TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY. WE HAVE PLAYED CHICKEN BEFORE WITH DEVELOPERS. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER RAISED THIS ISSUE. THE CITY PLACE APARTMENTS. THE CITY PLACE APARTMENTS ARE TWO UGLY PROPERTIES ON 5th, THAT WERE THE RESULT OF THE COUNCIL, AT THAT TIME, REFUSING TO ACCEPT A MIDDLE GROUND. THERE WERE SEVEN PROPERTIES, RECEIVEN OLD HOMES WHICH WERE OFFERED FOR REHABILITATION, IN EXCHANGE, ESSENTIALLY FOR IN-FILL DENSITY FROM BEHIND. THAT WAS REJECTED BY THE COUNCIL, AND THE DEVELOPER DID  WHAT THE DEVELOPERS DO THEY TOOK THE NEXT ALTERNATIVE WHICH WAS TO BULLDOZE THE HOUSES AND BUILD WHAT WAS THEIR RIGHT UNDER THE LAW. THAT IS MY CONCERN HERE. THE EXPECTATION TO CHALLENGE SENATOR WARREN'S COMMENT AND ETHOS IS ONE, I THINK, WE DO NEED TO LISTEN TO. WE OPERATE IN A SET OF FACTS AND LAWS THAT ARE MORE CONSTRAINED AND MORE CABINED. WE HAVE AREAS WHERE YOU CAN DREAM AND TAKE RISKS. WE ALSO HAVE AREAS IN WHICH OUR FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT IS -- IS SUBSTANTIALLY LIMITED. LIMITED BY LAW. HERE I DON'T THINK WE HAVE THAT FREEDOM OF ASPIRATION. I THINK WE HAVE REALITIES TO TEAL WITH AND THE REALITIES TO DEAL WITH ARE THAT THE TREES ARE IN PERIL. A VOTE NO HERE PUTS THOSE TREES IN PERIL AND I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT. COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
03:28:55.709: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. SO I STILL CAN'T COUNT NOSES. TWO PEOPLE HAVEN'T SPOKEN. IT SOUNDS LIKE TWO PEOPLE ARE ON THE FENCE AND THEN THE REST OF US ARE FAIRLY DIVIDED. I WANT TO LOOK TO MR. HEISSLER, THIS IS THE OPPORTUNITY WHERE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER PUBLIC BENEFIT THAT YOU CAN ARTICULATE OR ANY OPENNESS TO PUBLIC BENEFIT, THAT YOU WOULD BE WILLING TO MOVE ON, I JUST WOULDN'T WANT TO -- I WANT TO GIVE YOU THAT OPPORTUNITY.
03:29:32.879: >> I APPRECIATE THAT OPPORTUNITY. BUT I THINK IT'S BEEN VERY WELL STATED.
03:29:36.750: >> Councilmember Ackerman: OKAY.
03:29:45.191: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION?
03:29:51.064: >> Councilmember Ackerman: IT'S HIS PROPERTY. I'M SORRY.
03:29:56.269: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
03:29:59.005: >> Councilmember Griswold: COMPANIES WORK VERY HARD TO PROTECT THEIR REPUTATIONS. WE TALK ABOUT BRAND. I HOPE THAT WE CAN COME UP WITH AN ACCEPTABLE SOLUTION, BECAUSE IF SOMEONE WERE TO CLEAR CUT THAT AREA, AND ALL OF THOSE 300-YEAR-OLD TREES, I WOULD EXPECT IT TO MAKE NATION NEWS. [ APPLAUSE ] I DON'T MEAN THAT AS A THREAT. IT'S SOMEONE WHO HAS AN MBA COMPANIES SPEND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO PROTECT THEIR REPUTATION AND THEIR BRAND. I HOPE WE COME UP WITH A SOLUTION THAT DOESN'T MAKE NATIONAL NEWS. THANK YOU.
03:30:47.187: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. COUNCILMEMBER SMITH?
03:30:49.989: >> Councilmember Smith: SO IF THIS WERE AN EASY ONE, WE WOULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING ABOUT IT ALREADY. YOU KNOW, I THINK I TOO HARKEN BACK TO THE CITY PLACE APARTMENTS DEBACLE AND PROCEED WITH CAUTION, KNOWING HOW THAT TURNED OUT, I THINK SOMETIMES THIS JOB IS REALLY HARD BECAUSE WE HAVE TO PICK THE LEAST BAD OF SEVERAL UNPLEASANT OPTIONS. I THINK IT'S PARTICULARLY HARD WHEN WE ARE TRYING TO PROTECT A RESOURCE LIKE THESE TREES. I THINK ULTIMATELY NOT EVERY IN-FILL SITE IN THE CITY IS APPROPRIATE TO BUILD ON. NOT EVERY SITE IS THE SAME, THE CONTEXT OF THE SITE, TO ME, IS DEFINED BY THE TREES, HOWEVER, IT IS ALSO ON A BUS LINE. IT IS ALSO, YOU KNOW, A PLACE WHERE DIFFERENT HOUSING TYPE WOULD BE APPROPRIATE. I THINK THIS IS A TOUGH ONE. I'M NOT SURE HOW I'M GOING TO GO BUT COUNTING VOTES, I DON'T SEE THAT THERE ARE EIGHT VOTES TO SUPPORT. NEVERTHELESS, YOU KNOW, I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO BE MINDFUL OF, AS WE TALK ABOUT DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION AND AFFORDABILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY AND WORKING TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE, THAT THIS WILL REQUIRE A SACRIFICE OF ALL OF US. ONE THE THINGS THAT I HAVEN'T SEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION OF, IS, YOU KNOW, IF WE ARE GOING TO DECLARE A CLIMATE EMERGENCY, WHAT ARE WE PREPARED TO DO? ARE WE PREPARED TO LOCK AT OUR LAND USE POLICIES TO INCREASE DENSITY ALONG OUR TRANSIT LINES? ARE WE PREPARED TO LIMIT PARKING AND CAR USE? I DON'T KNOW. I'M NOT GETTING THE SENSE THAT WE REALLY ARE. SO I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE LOTS MORE DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT AND I WILL BE INTERESTED TO SEE WHAT MY COLLEAGUES -- HOW THEY VOTE ON THIS ONE, THANK YOU.
03:32:57.383: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
03:32:58.284: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THERE'S SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT THE CITY PLACE ON 5th AVENUE. I WASN'T A PART OF GOVERNMENT BACK THEN, BUT I DO REMEMBER THE CONVERSATIONS AROUND THAT. AND I THINK THERE'S A COUPLE OF FAILURES. ONE OF THEM WAS TO DESIGNATE IT AN HISTORICAL OVERLAY DISTRICT. THAT WOULD HAVE PROTECTED THOSE SEVEN HOMES. THE DEVELOPER TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE SITUATION WHEN THAT WASN'T DONE. I WANT TO PUT THAT ON THE RECORD THAT THIS COUNCIL -- OR THE REEVOUS COUNCIL FAILED TO MAKE THE AREA AN HISTORIC DISTRICT, WHICH ALLOWED FOR THE DEMOLITION OF THOSE HOMES. I AGREE WITH A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN SAID HERE TONIGHT. ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE REAL, BUT THAT SHOULD NOT FORCE US INTO MAKING DECISIONS THAT WE ARE NOT COMFORTABLE IN MAKING. FURTHERMORE, WE HAD SOMETHING THAT POSTPONED ON THE CONSENT AGENDA, WHERE WE HAVE THE D.D.A. COMING IN ASK US TO BUILD 350 MORE SPACES. SO THERE'S A LITTLE SCHIZSCHIZOPHRENIA ABOUT CAR USD THE FUTURE OF CAR USE, WHETHER WE WILL BE BUILDING MORE PARKING PLACES DOWNTOWN OR ARE WE GOING CARLESS. I GUESS WE HAVE THAT CONVERSATION NEXT MONDAY. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE PROBABLY NEED TO WRAP OUR HEADS AROUND AS POLICYMAKERS.
03:34:23.336: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
03:34:26.906: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YOU CAN SEE WHAT HAS WE GOING HERE. YOU SAW ME WANDERING AROUND AND TALKING TO FOLKS ABOUT IT A LITTLE BIT. I FIND A PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT IS -- IS SUPERIOR TO R1E ZONING FOR THIS SITE. WHAT I DON'T FIND AND I GET TO SPEAK TO THIS A LITTLE BIT LATER IS THE SITE PLAN THAT ACCOMPANIES THAT PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT IS NOT SATISFACTORY TO ME, NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF THE PUBLIC BENEFITS THAT IT KIND OF FAILS TO PROVIDE, BUT JUST BECAUSE OF WHAT IT'S TAKING AWAY. AND SO WE ARE KIND OF IN THIS -- WE HAVE THIS SORT OF MENTAL IMPASSE WHERE I LIKE THE IDEA OF A PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT BUT I DON'T LIKE THE SITE PLAN THAT'S ATTACHED TO IT. IT PUT ME IN THIS ODD BALL POSITION THAT I DIDN'T CREATE. I WOULD HAVE NEVER VOTED TO REZONE THIS R1E. I THINK R1E SHOULD BE DONE AWAY. I WOULD STRIKE IT FROM THE BOOKS TOMORROW IF I COULD. WE HAVE SEEN IT UP ON PONTIAC TRAIL, WHERE IT'S RESULTED IN THESE SUPPOSED TINY HOUSES 8 FEET APART FROM EACH OTHER. A BIG ROW OF HOUSES. I APPRECIATE THAT PARTS OF THIS SITE PLAN, THE IDEA THAT WE PUSH THESE TOGETHER TO SAVE, PRESERVE MORE NATURAL SPACE. THAT MAKES SENSE TO ME AND SO SOME OF THE PLAN AND THE PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT MAKES SENSE TO ME AND SOME DOESN'T. BUT WHAT THIS IS CALLING FOR AND I ONLY REFER TO CITY PLACE AS THE KIND OF CONUNDRUM THAT WE FIND OURSELVES IN AND I APPRECIATE COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI POINTING OUT THAT IT WAS THE FAILURES TO PROVIDE THE HISTORIC PROTECTION THAT THE RESIDENTS WERE CLAMORING FOR PREVIOUS TO THAT WAS THE REAL FAULT OF CITY PLACE BUT WE ARE IN A SITUATION HERE WHERE WE ARE BEING KIND OF ASKED TO JUDGE THINGS THAT WERE PUT BEFORE US FOR PREVIOUS BODIES ARE WE PLACING FUTURE RESIDENT NEEDS OVER CURRENT RESIDENTS' NEEDS? ARE WE PLACING BUILDINGS OVER NATURE? TAX BASE OVER QUALITY OF LIFE? AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT -- IT'S NOT NECESSARILY ONE OR THE OTHER, BUT I'M NOT FINDING THIS SITE PLAN THAT GOES ALONG WITH THIS PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT, THIS REZONING, YOU KNOW, STRIKING THE RIGHT BALANCE FOR ME. SO THIS IS -- AS I SAID, THIS IS A DIFFICULT DECISION. AND, YOU KNOW, I WISH YOU ALL WELL IN YOUR DECIDING.
03:36:42.175: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
03:36:49.382: >> Councilmember Bannister: NO.
03:36:52.952: >> Councilmember Griswold: NO.

03:37:22.982: >> COULD I MAKE A MOTION TO MOVE DB-1 UP NEXT. I DON'T KNOW THAT ANYBODY WILL HAVE ANY OBJECTIONS TO THE GLENS REVISED SITE PLAN. WE ALREADY HAD THEM FOR FIVE YEARS.
03:37:38.231: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WILL SECOND THAT.
03:37:45.171: >> Mayor Taylor: YES. [CHORUS OF AYES]
03:37:46.038: >> Councilmember Lumm: SO THEY CAN GO HOME.

AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND CHAPTER 55 (ZONING), REZONING OF 0.54 ACRE RESOLUTION TO APPROVE THE GLEN MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT MODIFIED PUD SITE PLAN, 201, 213, 215, 217 GLEN AVENUE AND 1025 EAST ANN STREET. DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? APPROVED. AS LONG AS WE ARE ROLLING WITH THAT, CAN WE GO DB-2?
03:38:25.711: >> SURE.
03:38:27.113: >> Councilmember Hayner: WHERE ARE WE AT?
03:38:31.584: >> Mayor Taylor: SINCE THE -- ANY OBJECTION TO ROLLING DB-2 IN NOW AS WELL? THE SITE LAND? IS IT APPROPRIATELY VOTED --
03:38:51.971: >> IF THE ZONING DENIES, THEN IT'S APPROPRIATE TO DENY THE SITE PLAN, BECAUSE IT --
03:39:01.447: >> Mayor Taylor: DB-2, IS COUNCIL COMFORTABLE WITH DB-2.
03:39:08.120: >> Councilmember Lumm: WITHOUT COMMENT?
03:39:09.021: >> Councilmember Ackerman: JUST A VOTE.
03:39:09.889: >> Councilmember Grand: WE ARE JUST VOTING IT.
03:39:12.058: >> Councilmember Lumm: CAN I MAKE ONE LITTLE COMMENT? [ LAUGHTER ]
03:39:15.027: >> Mayor Taylor: OF COURSE YOU CAN.
03:39:17.430: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THE MOTION RIGHT NOW IS JUST TO BRING IT TO THIS POINT IN THE AGENDA. SO I THINK WE ARE ALL IN AGREEMENT THAT SHOULD BE DONE.
03:39:28.808: >> Councilmember Lumm: YEAH. [CHORUS OF AYES]
03:39:30.409: >> Mayor Taylor: DB-2. RESOLUTION TO APPROVE WEBER PUD SITE PLAN AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT, 2857 PACKARD ROAD. MOVED BY HAYNER AND SECONDED BY LUMM. BRIEF DISCUSSION OF DB-2. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
03:39:40.386: >> Councilmember Lumm: I WAS GOING TO VOLT  VOTE AGAINST THEE PLAN, EVEN THOUGH I VOTED FOR THE ZONING. I DO THINK -- I -- I WASN'T AROUND WHEN THE DEBACLE OCCURRED IN THE 5th WARD, WHEN THE HISTORIC DISTRICT WAS NOT DECLARED AND THE PROPERTIES WERE LEVELED AND THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF REGRETS THAT FOLLOWED ON TO THAT. AND IN THIS CASE, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE TREES THAT COULD BE I ANNIHILATED, I THINK THE PUD, THE PUBLIC BENEFIT IS SUBSTANTIAL IN MY OPINION? NO. BUT THE TREES ARE SIGNIFICANT MALTER, AND WE -- WITH THIS PUD, WE HAVE A BETTER CHANCE OF SAVING MORE TREES THAN WE WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE. I VOTED FOR THE ZONING. I WASN'T GOING TO VOTE FOR THE SITE PLAN. WE JUST GOT THE ADVICE THAT IT MAKES SENSE NOW TO DENY THE SITE PLAN ALSO AND I'M HOPEFUL THAT WHATEVER COMES BACK TO US, THAT I WILL PURSUE IF POSSIBLE CREATING A STUDY COMMITTEE TO -- AN HISTORIC STUDY COMMITTEE TO LOOK AT THE 1850 PROPERTY. YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW WHERE THIS WILL GO, BUT I DID ASK ABOUT IT PREVIOUSLY, PRIOR TO TONIGHT, OBVIOUSLY, AND -- BUT NOW I THINK MAYBE -- AND WORK THAT POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITY. WHO KNOWS. BUT I WILL CERTAINLY GIVE THAT A TRY. AND I WELCOME THE SUPPORT OF ANYONE.
03:41:28.994: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN. ZA>> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. WE MADE SOME INCREMENTAL IMPROVEMENTS INTO PRESERVING IF THERE EVER WAS A KNOCK DOWN. I WOULD BE GLAD TO WITH YOU ON THAT. I WILL BE VOTING AGAINST THE SITE PLAN. I FIGURE WE SHOULD AT LEAST BE OF ONE VOICE NOW.
03:41:50.416: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER SMITH.
03:41:52.218: >> Councilmember Smith: THE SITE PLAN DOESN'T MEET THE ZONING SO IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY NOT TO APPROVE THE SITE PLAN.
03:41:58.757: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE SITE PLAN THAT WE ARE ALL VOTING AGAINST.
03:42:03.629: >> Councilmember Lumm: RIGHT.
03:42:04.263: >> Councilmember Hayner:  JUST TO SAY THAT IT'S --
03:42:06.866: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
03:42:08.334: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU. YOU KNOW, I JUST HAD ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS WHERE I WAS DISAPPOINTED MANY MYSELF, NOT FOR THE WAY I VOTED BECAUSE I THINK THE PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT WAS BETTER, BUT THAT I DOESN'T EXPRESS MYSELF IN A WAY TO MY COLLEAGUES THAT CONVINCED ONE MORE PERSON TO VOTE FOR THAT AND I FEEL -- I REGRET THAT I WASN'T CONVINCING ENOUGH BECAUSE I THINK THAT WE HAD A BETTER OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT AND THEN QUESTION THE SITE PLAN IN THE PARAMETERS THE PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT THAN WE DO NOW AND I APOLOGIZE FOR NOT DOING MORE TO CONVINCE ONE MORE PERSON TO MAYBE SUPPORT THAT PUD. BUT OBVIOUSLY THIS IS OUT OF BOUNDS NOW AND WE HAVE TO VOTE THIS DOWN WHICH IS NOT A PROBLEM FOR ME.
03:42:59.785: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
03:43:02.454: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES, I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I AGREE WITH COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD THAT IT WOULD BE NATIONAL NEWS IF THE DEVELOPER WERE TO COME THROUGH AND TRY TO TEAR DOWN THIS EXTREMELY VALUABLE STAND OF TREES. AND SO I'M ASKING YOU MAYOR TAYLOR AND IF NOT YOU, ANOTHER COUNCILMEMBER, TO DIG DEEP INTO OUR LEADERSHIP SKILLS AND OUR COMMUNICATION AND PERSUASION SKILLS TO CALL OUT TO OUR DEVELOPER AND OUR PROPERTY OWNER AND COME TO THE TABLE AND HAVE A HEART-TO-HEART CONVERSATION ABOUT THE CLIMATE CRISIS AND HOW THESE TREES ARE INVALUABLE AND -- AND I REALLY URGE YOU TO USE YOUR LEADERSHIP SKILLS, YOUR CONSIDERABLE LEADERSHIP SKILLS TO DO THAT FOR US, AND IF YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THAT, THEN I THINK THE REST OF US WILL HAVE TO DO THAT INSTEAD. THANK YOU.
03:44:05.651: >> Mayor Taylor: UNDERSTOOD. FURTHER DISCUSSION. ALL IN FAVOR? ALL OPPOSED? [ CHORUS OF NOS ] IT IS NOT APPROVED. OR RATHER THE MOTION FAILS, I GUESS IS THE PROPER NOMENCLATURE. C-4, AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND THE CODE OF THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR BY ADDING A NEW CHAPTER WHICH NEW CHAPTER SHALL BE DESIGNATED AS CHAPTER 70 ADULT-USE MARIJUANA ESTABLISHMENTS OF TITLE VII OF SAID CODE. MOVED BY HAYNER AND LUMM.
03:44:53.432: >> Councilmember Lumm: THIS SETS THE MARIJUANA ORDINANCE, AND ENGAGE THE COMMUNITY IN A DISCUSSION AND TALK WITH OTHER COMMUNITIES LIKE BOULDER THAT HAVE IMPLEMENTED RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA IN THEIR COMMUNITIES TO LEARN FROM THEIR EXPERIENCES. SPECIFICALLY THIS WOULD OPT OUT UNTIL DECEMBER 16th. IT'S TEMPORARY. WITH THE UP SETH DATE OF DECEMBER 16th. RATHER THAN ALLOW STATE TO TAKE APPLICATIONS FOR RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA FACILITIES IN ANN ARBOR ON NOVEMBER 1st, THIS SAYS ANN ARBOR WILL TAKE AN EXTRA 45 DAYS OR SO TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE GOT IT RIGHT, BEFORE APPLICATIONS FOR LICENSES FOR ESTABLISHMENTS IN ANN ARBOR WILL BE ACCEPTED BY THE STATE. FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS, WE SCRAMBLED TO MEET THIS NOVEMBER 1st DATE. THIS IS A BIG DEAL FOR ANN ARBOR, YET IT'S BEEN A GUN TO THE HEAD EVER SINCE WE GOT A FIRST LOOK AT THE ORDINANCES ON A FRIDAY. THREE DAYS BEFORE VOTING ON THE ORDINANCES AT FIRST READING. AND WITHOUT ENGAGING THE COMMUNITY IN ANY MEANINGFUL WAY. WHY THE RUSH IN COLLEAGUES INDICATED WE DON'T WANT TO SEND THE WRONG MESSAGE. ON SEPTEMBER 16th WE WERE TOLD BY STAFF THAT WE WOULD SEE THE PROPOSED, QUOTE COMPETITIVE PROCESS FOR ANN ARBOR THAT'S REQUIRED BY THE STATE TO ALLOCATE THE LIMITED NUMBER OF PERMITS EITHER TONIGHT OR NEXT MEETING. IT'S NOT ON AGENDA TONIGHT AND WE HAVE NOT SEEN THE PROPOSAL YET. OBVIOUSLY, THE PROCESS BY WHICH -- BY WHICH WE ARE GOING TO GRANT PERMITS AND CONDITIONS FOR RENEWING THEM IS AN IMPORTANT OPEN ITEM, BUT HAVING MORE TIME TO DISCUSS THAT PROCESS, AND PERHAPS TWEAK IT, ISN'T THE ONLY BENEFIT OF TAKING A BIT MORE TIME. THE EXTRA TIME WOULD ALLOW US TO CONDUCT SOME REAL BENCHMARKING AND DISCOVERY OF WHAT OTHER COMMUNITIES WHO HAVE LIVED THIS LIKE BOULDER OR EUGENE HAVE LEARNED FROM THEIR EXPERIENCES. WHAT THEY LEARNED ABOUT RELEVANT POLICIES AND OPERATIONAL ASPECTS AND ABOUT ENFORCEMENT AND NECESSARY PUBLIC SAFETY RESOURCES AND ABOUT OVERSIGHT AND GOVERNANCE. THERE'S A SAYING, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WE DON'T KNOW AND THAT COULD CERTAINLY APPLY HERE. THE EXTRA TIME WOULD ALLOW US TO LOOK DEEPER INTO FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS LIKE OUM FACILITIES ARE APPROPRIATE FOR ANN ARBOR. THE CAP NUMBERS WE ORIGINALLY SET FOR MEDICAL MARIJUANA PROVISIONING CENTERS WAS COMPLETELY ARBITRARY. IT WAS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS THAT WE HAD AT A POINT IN TIME WHICH HAPPENED TO BE 28. NOW WE CARRIED FORWARD THAT 28 FOR PROVISIONING CENTERS AND -- OR RETAILERS AND SET THAT SAME ARBITRARY LIMIT OF 28 FOR DESIGNATED CONSUMPTION FACILITIES AND MICROBUSINESSES, ALL THOUGH I DO SUPPORT CAPS, I HAVE NO CLUE WHAT THE APPROPRIATE NUMBERS ARE AND WE HAVE NO DATE DATA OR ANALYSIS OR REASON BASIS FOR THE DATA. AND THE RELATIONSHIP OF RESOURCES REQUIRED TO THE NUMBER OF FACILITIES THAT WE HAVE. AND LOOK AT ISSUES LIKE AT PARENT ODORS EMANATING FROM OUTDOOR GROWING OPERATIONS IN NEIGHBORHOODS. THIS IS A CONCERN THAT WAS BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION AT MY AWARD 2 COFFEE ON THURSDAY. IT WAS BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION BY ACTUALLY A THIRD WARD --
03:48:04.556: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER, THREE MINUTES.
03:48:06.592: >> Councilmember Lumm: WHAT?
03:48:07.259: >> Mayor Taylor: THREE MINUTES.
03:48:08.260: >> Councilmember Lumm: I WILL WRAP UP.
03:48:09.294: >> Mayor Taylor: PLEASE DO.
03:48:10.596: >> Councilmember Lumm: IT WAS BROUGHT YOU TO MY ATTENTION BY A THIRD WARD RESIDENT AND SOMETHING I DIDN'T CONSIDER, PREVIOUSLY I DID SEND A NOTE TO OUR CITY ATTORNEY ABOUT THIS AND STILL WAITING FOR A RESPONSE BECAUSE OUR ORDINANCE DOESN'T ADDRESS THIS PARTICULAR TYPE OF CONCERN. PERHAPS MOST OF ALL, THE EXTRA TIME WOULD ALLOW US TO HAVE A MORE ROBUST COMMUNITY CONVERSATION. WE HAD A HEARD FROM PERSPECTIVE AND ANN ARBOR MARIJUANA FACILITY PROPRIETORS AND THEIR LAWYERS AND ACTIVISTS BUT WE HAVEN'T REALLY HEARD FROM THE COMMUNITY. IT'S NOT JUST ME AND YOUR CONSTITUENTS THAT HAVE QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS. STILL STAFF HAS INDICATED THAT TAKING A BIT MORE TIME MAY BE AN APPROPRIATE WAY TO PROCEED. THE DECEMBER 16th DATE CAME FROM STAFF AND I APPRECIATE MR. McDONALD'S ASSISTANCE IN DEVELOPING THE LANGUAGE IN THE ORDINANCE. THANK YOU FOR LISTENING AND FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.
03:49:04.483: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
03:49:11.290: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, MAYOR TAYLOR. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM TALKED ABOUT VOTERS, IS THAT SOMETHING THAT IS ADDRESSED IN THE ORDINANCE? THANK YOU.
03:49:32.110: >> GOOD EVENING MAYOR AND COUNCIL, BRETT LENART, THE PLANNING MANAGER. THE U.D.C. WHERE WE REGULATE THE LAND USE ASPECTS OF MEDICAL MARIJUANA DOES PROHIBIT THE DETECTION OF ODOR AT THE PROPERTY LINE FOR ANY TYPE OF FACILITY.
03:49:48.093: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: OKAY. THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE COUNCILMEMBER LUMM'S DILIGENCE AND PERSISTENCE IN JUST VIGILANCE WHEN IT COMES TO GOOD GOVERNMENT AND, YOU KNOW, HERE'S ANOTHER APPLICATION OF IT ALLOWING THE CITIZENS TO ENGAGE THEIR GOVERNMENT, TO GET IT RIGHT. YOU KNOW, THERE'S NOTHING THAT'S PERFECT. THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE PERFECT. BUT WE HAVE HAD OVER TEN YEARS OF EXPERIENCE WITH MEDICAL MARIJUANA IN OUR COMMUNITY. THERE HAVE NOT BEEN ANY MAJOR ISSUES. IN FACT, LAST WEEK AT AN ICPOC MEETING WITH MYSELF AND A FEW COMMISSIONERS, WE HAD THE PRIVILEGE TO SPEAK WITH DEPUTY POLICE CHIEF AND SERGEANT MILLS -- LIEUTENANT MILLS ACTUALLY NOW, AND OUR POLICE CHIEF AND WE TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THE MONTHS WHERE THERE WERE THE MOST CALLS AND PEOPLE RESISTING ARREST AND ALL OF THAT. IT WAS A FIVE-HOUR MEETING AND ONE THE COMMISSIONERS, I GUESS, APRIL IS ONE OF THE MONTHS WHERE YOU HAVE MORE PROBLEMS THAN NOT. ONE THE COMMISSIONERS SAID THAT'S MAYBE BECAUSE THE HASH BASH. THEY WERE QUICKLY CORRECTED AND SAID, NO, THAT'S ACTUALLY NOT A DAY WHERE WE HAVE MAJOR ISSUES. IT'S NOT LIKE A FOOTBALL FRIDAY OR A FOOTBALL SATURDAY. YOU KNOW, SO EVEN WITH EVENTS LIKE HASH BASH, WHICH WE HEARD ABOUT EARLIER TONIGHT, WE DON'T HAVE THIS -- THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE ON FOOTBALL SATURDAYS. I MEAN, TAKE A RIDE-ALONG ON A HASH BASH. I DON'T THINK IT WILL BE THE SAME KIND OF EXPERIENCE THAT YOU WOULD HAVE HAD LAST SATURDAY OR LAST FRIDAY. SO I JUST FEEL I APPRECIATE THE DILIGENCE AND WE HAVE HAD WEEKS FOR THE COMMUNITY TO REACH OUT SINCE THE FIRST READING, AND THERE REALLY HASN'T BEEN AN OUTCRY SAYING THAT, HEY, YOU ARE GOING TO GO OFF THE CLIFF HERE. WATCH WHAT YOU ARE DOING. FRANKLY, WE HAVEN'T HEARD THAT. SO APPRECIATE IT, BUT I WON'T BE SUPPORTING IT TONIGHT.
03:52:02.627: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
03:52:04.429: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I -- I MEAN, I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM SUPPORTING A TEMPORARY OPT OUT LIKE THIS, WITH A DATE CERTAIN AT THE END OF IT. AND I WILL JUST SHARE WITH YOU WHY. BECAUSE EVERY DAY THAT GOES BY, AS I PAY ATTENTION TO THIS AND READ THIS AND LISTEN TO STORIES ON THE RADIO AND LOOK AT THIS AND SO ON AND SO ON, I LOOK AT WHAT OTHER COMMUNITIES HAVE DONE. THESE NEW QUESTIONS KEEP COMING UP AND IT'S JUST QUESTION AFTER QUESTION. AT SOME POINT WE GOT TO DRAW THE LINE AND MAKE THESE LAWS. I UNDERSTAND THAT. NOW WE HAVE -- NOW WE HAVE HEALTH CONCERNS OVER THE QUALITY OF THE -- OF VAPING CARTRIDGES WHERE PEOPLE ARE DYING. WE WILL LET THAT INTO OUR COMMUNITY? ARE WE GOING TO GUARANTEE THAT WE ARE NOT? WE HAVE SPACING CONCERNS THAT SOME RESIDENTS HAVE TALKED ABOUT AND THOSE AREN'T NEW. WE HAD CONCERNS ABOUT THAT FOR MEDICAL MARIJUANA. I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THIS IS NOT MEDICAL MARIJUANA. THIS IS RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA. THIS IS A DIFFERENT ANIMAL HERE. WE HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE NUMERICAL LIMITS. I TOOD TO SET SOME LIMITS THAT WERE HIGH FOR ALL OF THEM, THAT DIDN'T PASS. PERHAPS WE SHOULD HAVE NO LIMITS ON THEM BECAUSE IT'S STARTING TO SEEM KIND OF ARBITRARY AND I'M WONDERING IF THIS ARBITRARY SETTING OF LIMITS IS GOING TO OPEN US UP TO LITIGATION. THERE'S ECOLOGICAL CONCERNS I HEARD ABOUT YESTERDAY ON THE RADIO IN THE STATE OF COLORADO, ESPECIALLY DENVER WHICH HAS AIR QUALITY ISSUES, JUST LIKE ANN ARBOR. IT TURNS OUT THAT THE LARGE GROW OPERATIONS, THE TERPINOIDS COMING OFF THE PLANTS ARE GETTING KICKED OUT OF THE BUILDINGS AND CREATING S OZONE T OF THESE BUILDINGS, AIR QUALITY ISSUES. MOST OF THESE BIG GROW AREAS OR IN THE M1, M2 IT, AND THEY ARE ON THE FRINGES OF THE CITY AND THERE'S LOTS OF CARS IN THE AREA. SO THAT WAS A CURIOUS THING. I DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM SUPPORTING THIS BECAUSE I KNOW WE WILL GET IT DONE ON THAT DATE AND LIKE I SAY, THE MORE I LOOK AT THIS, THE MORE QUESTIONS I HAVE. AND, YOU KNOW, THAT'S NOT A GOOD PLACE TO BE LEGGING FROM.
03:54:19.264: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
03:54:20.565: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU, EVERYONE. I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY SOMETHING. THIS RESIDENT THAT BROUGHT THE ODOR CONCERNS TO MY ATTENTION, IT HAS TO DO -- THIS INDIVIDUAL DOES NOT WANT TO IMPLICATE ANYONE, BUT IN THIS GIVEN NEIGHBORHOOD, ONE PERSON IS GROWING FIVE PLANTS AND WAS GOOD TO GO WITH IT. SO IT'S AN OUTSIDE. IT'S NOT A FACILITY BUILDING PROBLEM. IT'S AN OUTSIDE PROBLEM THAT AS WAS DESCRIBED -- AND I PASSED THIS ALONG TO STAFF. IT'S LIVING WITH A SKUNK SMELL THAT ROLLS INTO THE HOUSE ON A 24/7 BASIS. THIS PERSON LIVES WITH THE WINDOWS -- AND OTHER NEIGHBORS, APPARENTLY IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD, WINDOWS ROLLED UP, 24/7, CAN'T USE AIR CONDITIONING. AND CAN'T GO OUTSIDE. AND I WAS -- I LEARNED OPEN THURSDAY THAT IT'S CALLED SKUNK WEED. WHY DO YOU THINK IT'S CALLED SKUNK WEED, JANE, THIS PERSON SAID TO ME. ANYWAY, I SENT PHOTO. I FOLLOWED UP WITH THE ATTORNEY'S OFFICE AND MY QUESTION IS:  WHAT DOES OUR ORDER NUISANCE PROVIDE IN TERMS OF PROTECTIONS AND ENFORCEMENT? WHAT DO YOU RECOMMEND WE INCORPORATE? THE MARIJUANA ORDINANCE TO ADDRESS? I JUST SENT THAT IN ON FRIDAY. I HEARD FROM THIS PERSON ON THURSDAY. HAVEN'T RECEIVED A RESPONSE BACK. I -- THE STAFF HAS BEEN PRETTY BUSY. SO THAT'S OKAY. BUT IT'S JUST AN -- TO ME, IT WAS, YOU KNOW, A VERY REAL EXAMPLE OF THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE NEED TO THINK THROUGH THAT WE HAVEN'T YET THOUGHT THROUGH. THANKS.
03:55:56.628: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. LET ME SUGGEST THAT WE ALL KNOW HOW WE ARE GOING TO VOTE ON THIS AND MOVE ON. I DON'T WISH TO SQUELCH. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
03:56:06.838: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I'M PRETTY SURE THAT MARIJUANA IS GOING TO STICK 90 DAYS FROM NOW AS WELL.
03:56:13.445: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. ROLL CALL VOTE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
03:56:21.152: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES.
03:56:23.922: >> Councilmember Griswold: NO.
03:56:29.694: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES.

03:56:39.104: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES.
03:56:40.372: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION FAILS.
03:56:43.408: >> Mayor Taylor: B3 AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND SECTIONS --
03:56:52.317: >> Councilmember Bannister: EXCUSE MY. I WAS OUT OF THE ROOM AND I WISHED TO VOTE THE OTHER WAY ON THAT ISSUE.
03:56:57.789: >> Mayor Taylor: COULD WE NOTE THAT FOR THE RECORD? IS THERE ANY OBJECTION FROM THE BODY? SO COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER, NEGATIVE ON THAT VOTE. THANK YOU.
03:57:08.867: >> Mayor Taylor: B-3, AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND SECTIONS 5.15, 5.16.3, 5.19.2, AND 5.37.2 OF CHAPTER 55 (UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE) OF TITLE V OF THE CODE OF THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER SMITH, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI. DISCUSSION OF B-3. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
03:57:33.958: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I HAVE TWO AMENDMENTS FOR B-3 AND MY THANKS TO CITY ATTORNEY McDONALD FOR THE HELP IN DRAFTING THIS SPECIFIC LANGUAGE FOR THE AMENDMENTS. ACTUALLY, P MS. BEAUDRY, I WONDR IF YOU COULD -- I RESENT THEM TO MYSELF. THEY ARE ON THEIR WAY TO YOU RIGHT NOW. I'M HITTING SEND. YOU SHOULD HAVE THEM. HAVE YOU RECEIVED THEM?
03:58:38.857: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
03:58:39.457: >> Councilmember Lumm: AMENDMENT NUMBER ONE IS AN AMENDMENT MOVING THE FIRST AMENDMENT.
03:58:45.196: >> Mayor Taylor: PLEASE.
03:58:45.730: >> Councilmember Lumm: TO EXPAND THE 1,000-FOOT RULE BEYOND JUST SCHOOLS. THE FIRST AMENDMENT RELATES TO THE RESTRICTION THAT FACILITIES MAY NOT BE LOCATED WITHIN 1,000 FEEL OF A SCHOOL. THE AMENDMENT WOULD PLACE THAT SAME 1,000-FOOT RESTRICTION ON CHILD CARE CENTERS, GROUP CHILD CARE HOMES ADDICTION RECOVERY FACILITIES AND YOUTH CENTERS IN ADDITION TO SCHOOLS. SPECIFICALLY THE AMENDMENT REVISES SECTION --
03:59:07.819: >> Mayor Taylor: CAN WE JUST GET A SECOND ON THIS? SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM YOU STILL WILL HAVE THE FLOOR.
03:59:13.892: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANKS. SPECIFICALLY THE AMENDMENT REVISES SECTION 5, 16.3. G .3. F, THAT SECTION ENDS WITH PUBLIC SCHOOL OR PRIVATE SCHOOL BUT EXCLUDING DANCE OR ART SCHOOLS IS LOCATED, END QUOTE. THIS AMENDMENT WOULD ADD THE FOLLOWING AFTER ART SCHOOLS. "OR A CHILD CARE CENTER OR GROUP CHILD CARE CENTER IS DESIGNED IN MCL77.2.11 AND SON ON OR AN ADDICTION RECOVERY FACILITY OR A YOUTH CENTER DESCRIBED AS A FACILITY AND RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES INTENDED PRIMARILY FOR CHILDREN, CLOSE PAREN AND CLOSE QUOTE. I MOVE THAT TO THE OTHER SECTION. THAT WAS JUST WHAT I WAS MOVING. AND THEN A COMMENT.
04:00:14.786: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER.
04:00:15.520: >> Councilmember Lumm: I WAS EXPLAINING IT.
04:00:17.922: >> Mayor Taylor: PLEASE.
04:00:18.523: >> Councilmember Lumm: WHAT THIS DOES IS TO RETAIN THE 1,000 FEET FOR SCHOOLS, BUT ALSO PLACES THAT 1,000-FOOT RESTRICTION ON CHILD CARE CENTERS AND GROUP CHILD CARE HOMES. BOTH OF THESE ARE BASED ON THE STATE'S DEFINITION. AN ADDICTION RECOVERY CENTER WHICH IS DEFINED HERE. I HAD PROPOSED THESE SAME CHANGES FOR MEDICAL MARIJUANA BUT THE MAJORITY OF COUNCIL DID NOT SUPPORT THEM AT THAT TIME. I BELIEVE THAT AS ANN ARBOR MOVES TO RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA AND ITS HIGHER VOLUME, WE SHOULD AGAIN CONSIDER THE CHANGES. BOULDER PLACES LOW INDICATIONAL RESTRICTIONS ON CHILD CARE FACILITIES AND ADDICTION FACILITIES AND LOS ANGELES INCLUDES YOUTH CENTERS AS WELL. I THINK EXPANDING THE SCOPE BEYOND THE SCHOOLS THEMSELVES TO INCLUDE OTHER CENTERS AND FACILITIES WHERE STUDENT AND YOUTH ARE LOCATED ON A REGULAR BASIS IS FULLY CONSISTENT WITH THE INTENT OF THE SCHOOL RESTRICTION WE ALREADY ADOPTED AND INCLUDING A RESTRICTION ON PROXIMITY TO ADDICTION RECOVERY FACILITIES MAKES COMMON SENSE. I HOPE YOU WILL AGREE AND SUPPORT THIS AMENDMENT. THANKS FOR CONSIDERING IT AND THANK YOU AGAIN, MR. McDONALD.
04:01:25.523: >> Mayor Taylor: I MYSELF AND COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN. I INQUIRED AS TO WHETHER THIS WOULD INCLUDE A SUBSTANTIVE AMENDMENT, THUS PUSHING BACK FROM THE SECOND READING TO PUT ANOTHER SECOND READING AT OUR NEXT MEETING. THE ANSWER IS THAT IT WOULD. THEREFORE, VOTING AFFIRMATIVE ON THIS BLOWS US THROUGH THE NOVEMBER 1 DEADLINE. SO THAT'S SOMETHING TO NOTE IF THE COUNCIL WISHES TO BRING THIS BACK UP LATER. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DO. BUT BE MINDFUL OF THAT. ON THE SUBSTANCE, I VOTED AGAINST THIS CREATING AN ADDITIONAL EXPANSION ZONE OR PROHIBITED ZONES AT THE PRIOR EFFORT. MY LOGIC THEN IS CONSISTENT WITH BIOLOGICAL NOW, AND THAT IS FOLKS WHO ARE GOING TO CHILD CARE CENTERS OR GROUP CHILD CARE HOMES ARE TYPICALLY ACCOMPANIED BY PARENTS. THE RISK OF CHILDREN HAVING UNSUPERVISED ACCESS TO MARIJUANA, YOU KNOW, STRAYING AROUND THE VICINITY, YOU KNOW, DISCARDED ON THE GROUND IS -- WHICH IS, I THINK -- AS I UNDERSTAND IT THE PRIMARY OBJECTION TO THIS SORT OF THING. IT DOESN'T STRIKE ME AS PARTICULARLY PERSUASIVE. FOLKS DON'T DISCARD THEIR PRODUCT, THE EXPERIENCE WITH THE MEDICAL MARIJUANA, THEY ARE AKIN TO DENTIST AND NOT LIQUOR STORES. I THINK THE PROVISIONING CENTERS THAT WE WILL EXPERIENCE IN THE COMMUNITY WILL BE -- THEY WILL SIMILARLY BE GOOD NEIGHBORS AND SO, I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT THIS ON THE SUBSTANCE, THOUGH, I AM PARTICULARLY WORRIED ABOUT THIS ON THE PROCEDURE AND THE TIMING ELEMENT.
04:03:17.602: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
04:03:18.536: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS TONIGHT. I THINK THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MY PERSPECTIVE, SINCE THE LAST TIME WE TALKED ABOUT MARIJUANA PUBLICLY AND NOW IS THAT I'M IN RECOVERY MYSELF. AND WHILE, YOU KNOW, MY ISSUE WAS ALCOHOL, AND MARIJUANA IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT DRUG WITH COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SETS OF BEHAVIORS, I DID TAKE IT UPON MYSELF TO TALK TO EXPERTS IN THE FIELD WHO ARE THEMSELVES ALSO IN RECOVERY. AND I CAN'T BY ANY MEANS SPEAK FOR T THE ENTIRE RECOVERY BUT OY RELAY THAT THE AMENDMENTS IN -- AND ONES LAID OUT IN THIS GENERALLY RECEIVED POSITIVE FEEDBACKS FROM ADDICTION SPECIALISTS AND SOCIAL WORKERS. I WANTED TO ADD THAT. I WILL BE SUPPORTING IT BECAUSE THAT'S THE FEEDBACK I GOT FROM THOSE STAKEHOLDERS.
04:04:08.886: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER. PGH >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER
04:04:10.354: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK K YOU, COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN FOR THAT. I HAD SOME DAY CARE FOLKS APPROACH ME AFTER THE LAST MEETING HASN'T THEY WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT STATE LAW THAT ALLOWS THEM TO OPERATE DAY CARE OR CHILD CARE CENTERS ALLOWS THEM TO HAVE KIDS IN THERE UP TO 15 YEARS OLD. AND SO THIS ISN'T A BUNCH OF PRESCHOOLERS. IT IS NOT A BUNCH OF THIRD GRADERS OR FOURTH GRADERS. THEY HAVE KIDS IN AFTER-SCHOOL PROGRAMS WHERE THEY ARE RIDING THE BUS AND GOING TO THE AFTER-SCHOOL PROGRAMS AT THESE LICENSED DAY CARE FACILITIES. THEY OPERATE AFTER SCHOOL SEPARATIONS AND SO IT'S MORE THAN JUST LITTLE KIDS WHO WOULDN'T KNOW POT IF THEY FOUND IT. AND A ASSUME THAT --EN I KNOW MR. LENART COULD ANSWER THIS. I HOPE IN THE STATE LAW THAT WE WILL ADOPT HERE EVENTUALLY, THAT THERE'S SOME KIND OF RESTRICTIONS ON THE DISPOSAL AND THE GARBAGE FOR THESE PLACES BECAUSE I JUST KNOW AS A -- BECAUSE IT'S IN THE FIRST WARD THAT I HAVE HAD COMPLAINTS ABOUT DISPENSARY IN THE FIRST WARD'S GARBAGE THAT'S CONSTANTLY BEING CHURNED AND THROWN IN THE ALLEY OFF OF WASHINGTON. IN FACT, I KNOW OF FOLKS WHO KNOW WHICH DUMPSTERS TO JUMP AND PULL OUT EXPIRED MARIJUANA PRODUCTS THAT ARE BEING DISCARDED AND NOT LOCKED UP AND DISCARDED IN A SECURE MANNER AND THEY DO WHAT THEY WANT WITH THEM. AND SO I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S A STATE PROVISION THAT THE GARBAGE OF THESE PLACES HAS TO BE LOCKED DOWN OR SECURED IN ANY WAY, BUT IF NOT, THERE SHOULD BE AND THIS IS ONE OF THE MANY QUESTIONS THAT HAS COME UP, SINCE THIS HAS COME BEFORE ME. AND SO, YOU KNOW, WHEN A GUY SHOWS ME A FISTFUL OF VAPE PENS THAT HE GOT OUT OF A DISPENSARY'S GARBAGE, I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE WAY THESE THINGS ARE RUN. AND THAT WILL ONLY BE MAGNIFIED WHEN IT'S RECREATIONAL USE. I FULLY SUPPORT THIS PALTRY EFFORT TO APPLY SOME SAFEGUARDS TO THESE REGULATIONS WE ARE CREATING.
04:06:31.228: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
04:06:32.897: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I APPRECIATE THIS. THE QUESTION THE PROCEDURAL. THIS WILL NEGATE US HAVING ANYTHING IN EFFECT FOR THE NOVEMBER 1st DEADLINE. WE CAN TAKE UP THESE OTHER ISSUES AT A LATER TIME. I HAVE ISSUES WITH THIS. IT'S NOT PERFECT. BUT WE WILL HAVE MUCH MORE TIME AND OPPORTUNITY IN THE FUTURE TO ADDRESS ALL OF THESE CONCERNS. AND JUST -- I CANNOT SUPPORT IT BECAUSE IT EFFECTIVELY OPTS US OUT.
04:07:10.267: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
04:07:11.168: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I HAVE A QUICK QUESTION OR CONFIRMATION. AWFUL THE PERMITS RELATED TO THESE CENTERS, THEY ARE STILL SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE, AREN'T THEY? OR ARE THEY NOT?
04:07:23.848: >> YES, ALL PROVISIONING CENTERS AND RETAILERS ARE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USES.
04:07:27.385: >> Councilmember Nelson: WELL, SO I GUESS MY OPPOSITION TO THIS WOULD BE THEN BOTH PROCEDURAL AS WELL AS JUST A FEELING THAT, YOU KNOW, IF THERE'S A GREAT DEAL OF OPPOSITION TO A PERMIT BECAUSE IT'S IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO A CHILD CARE CENTER AS COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER MENTIONED MAYBE A CENTER THAT IS CARING FOR OLDER CHILDREN, THE AFTER-SCHOOL PROGRAM FOR AFTER-SCHOOL CHILDREN, THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT ARE CONSIDERED WHEN DECISIONS ARE MADE ABOUT THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE. AND SO, I MEAN, THIS IS COMING -- A SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE IS COMING THROUGH PLANNING COMMISSION, CORRECT? SO IT'S A CONVERSATION THAT WOULD HAPPEN AND SO IT SE SEEMSO ME WE DON'T NEED TO MAKE A RULE ABOUT THIS, PARTICULARLY IN THE RANGE OF CHILD CARE CENTERS IS INFANTS AND THEN THIS -- THE AFTER SCHOOL -- I MEAN THOSE ARE TWO VERY DIFFERENT THINGS AND WE ARE PAINTING WITH A VERY BROAD BRUSH. THAT'S THE WAY I SEE IT ANYWAY.
04:08:22.773: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN. ZACK >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR COME I ASK YOU, MR. LENART. THE PROCEEDINGS ARE SEMI JUDICIAL AND THEY -- WHILE THERE IS SOME DISCRETION, YOU STILL HAVE TO FOLLOW ZONING CODE AS IT'S LAID OUT AND IF THERE ISN'T A DISTANCE REQUIREMENT, THEN YOU COULDN'T ENACT THEM AD HOC WITH RESPECT TO A PARTICULAR PETITION.
04:08:52.002: >> SO IT PUTS FORTH A SERIES OF STANDARDS. THOSE STANDARDS ARE AROUND -- IT'S A YES/NO, DOES THE USE MEET THE REQUIREMENTS IF THERE ARE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS AND THEN THE SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS THEY EVALUATE OTHER THINGS SUCH AS THE PROXIMITY AND THE PROXIMITY TO OTHER USES AND PROXIMITY TO THE MASTER PLAN AND HAVE SPECIFIC EVALUATION AS IT RELATES TO TRANSPORTATION ACCESS TO THAT USE AT THAT LOCATION, BOTH FOR VEHICULAR AND NON-MOTORIZED. SO YOU ARE RIGHT. THERE IS A LEVEL OF -- I WOULD SAY A LEVEL OF DISCRETION IS APPLIED BUT IT IS NOT WIDE OPEN AND IT'S SET FORTH BY STANDARDS BY WHICH THEY CONSIDER THOSE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE PERMITS.
04:09:38.349: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  SO I GUESS JUST TO CUT TO THE CHASE, THE AMOUNT OF DISCRETION ARTICULATED BY COUNCILMEMBER NELSON, AND I DON'T CARE EITHER WAY, IS THAT AMOUNT OF DISCRETION AVAILABLE TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION?
04:09:55.666: >> SO I WOULD -- I WOULD ACTUALLY GO BACK TO PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE, WHERE WE ACTUALLY -- THEY ACTUALLY HAD DIALOGUE ABOUT PETITIONS THAT WERE IN PROXIMITY TO CHILD CARE CENTERS WITHOUT SUCH LANGUAGE ALOOING AND I WOULD SAY SOME OF THOSE ASPECTS CAME AND WERE DAYLIGHTED AS PART OF THAT DISCUSSION. ULTIMATELY, THAT SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE PERMIT WAS GRANTED. SO I WOULD GENERALLY SAY THAT IF THE STANDARD IS SCHOOLS AND IT DOESN'T INCLUDE CHILD CARE CENTERS, I WOULD PROBABLY NOT ADD THE DISCRETION TO SAY, WELL, IN THIS CASE, WE THINK BECAUSE THERE IS A DAY CARE CENTER, IT WOULD BE INAPPROPRIATE TO LOCATE THIS THERE. IF THAT WAS AN INTENTION TO USE THAT AS A FACTOR, I THINK IT WOULD HAVE TO PROBABLY BE IDEALIZED MORE BROADLY APPLIED, THAT IS WHEN THOSE IF A SELLITIES ARE -- FACILITIES ARE LOCATED THERE, AND WHETHER THEY ARE STRICTLY SERVING PRESCHOOLERS OR A WIDER RANGE OF CHILDREN THAN IT WOULD FAIL THAT TEST.
04:10:57.394: >> Councilmember Ackerman: OKAY. THANK YOU.
04:11:01.031: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? MR. McDONALD?
04:11:09.406: >> I THINK COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER WAS ASKING A QUESTION ABOUT THE DISPOSAL. IF YOU WANT, THERE'S A VERY SIMPLE ANSWER FOR THAT. IN THE EMERGENCY RULES, ANY MARIJUANA PRODUCT THAT IS TO BE DESTROYED HAS TO BE RENDERED IN UNUSABLE AND UNRECOGNIZABLE FORM. AND I'M JUST READING THE FIRST OF -- I DON'T KNOW, SEVEN OR EIGHT RULES ABOUT THE DISPOSAL. SO THERE ARE PLENTY OF RULES ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT COULD BE REUSED OR SOMEONE COULD DUMPSTER DIVE AND FIND SOME USE FOR IT.
04:11:37.601: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I APPRECIATE THAT, BECAUSE THE TALK WAS OF THESE THINGS LYING ABOUT ON THE GROUND AND AS -- IN MY ALTER EGO AS THE GRAFFITI REMOVAL SPECIALIST, I SEE THEM ALL THE TIME AND IN THE ALLEYS AND THE ROOFTOPS AND UP ON BUILDINGS AND UNDER BRIDGES AND I SEE THIS MARIJUANA PACKAGING LAYING EVERYWHERE. AND THAT'S UNDER MEDICAL RULES AND ALL I CAN THINK IS THESE POOH ARE GUYS HAD TO, YOU KNOW, DEAL WITH THEIR GLAUCOMA BEFORE THEY RAN INTO THE CLUB OR BEFORE THEY WENT UP AND SPRAY PAINTED THIS BUILDING OR SOMETHING. I JUST THINK -- YOU KNOW, I'M GLAD THAT THE ARTHRITIS WAS CURED UP ENOUGH. SO, IT'S A CONCERN. IT'S LEGITIMATE. I THINK THE FACT THAT WE KIND OF -- WE ARE THINKING THIS IS SOME KIND OF OUTRAGEOUS RESTRICTION ON OUR AUTHORITY TO MANAGE THIS BY SAYING KEEP IT AWAY FROM DAY CARE CENTERS. IT'S UNBELIEVABLE TO ME THAT IT'S LIKELY THAT THIS AMENDMENT IS GOING TO FAIL. I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE THAT, THAT WE SHOW SO LITTLE CONCERN FOR THE YOUTH IN OUR COMMUNITY.
04:12:43.500: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER GRAND?
04:12:46.537: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. VERY BRIEFLY DUE TO TIMING CONCCONCERNS, I WON'T BE SUPPORG THIS BUT I WOULD BE OPEN TO TALKING ABOUT THE ADDICTION CENTERS IN THE FUTURE. I DON'T SEE THE PRESCHOOL PIECE AS BEING VIABLE, JUST DUE TO MY OWN EXPERIENCE WITH KIDS IN PRESCHOOL AND UNDERSTANDING HOW CONTAINED THOSE SPACES ARE, I -- I DO -- I AM QUITE SYMPATHETIC TO THE CONCERN ABOUT ADDICTION CENTERS AND WOULD BE PLEASED TO SUPPORT AN AMENDMENT AFTER WE GET THROUGH THIS NOVEMB NOVEMBER 1st KIDLINE.
04:13:25.743: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. -- DEADLINE.
04:13:29.446: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE.
04:13:31.248: >> Councilmember Bannister: NO. ING.
04:13:32.916: >> Councilmember Griswold: NO.
04:13:35.919: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES.

04:13:42.926: >> Councilmember Smith: NO.
04:13:43.527: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: NEGATIVE.
04:13:45.329: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES.
04:13:47.331: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION FAILS. COUNCIL MEMBER LUMM, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR WITH RESPECT TO YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT.
04:13:51.502: >> Councilmember Lumm: THE SECOND AMENDMENT ADDS DESIGNATED CONSUMPTION USE. TO THOSE LOCATES WHERE -- IN TERMS OF PROM I AMITY TO ANOTHER FACILITY. SPECIFICALLY THE AMENDMENT REVISES SECTION 5.16.3. G .3. C THAT SECTION REALS THAT NO MEDICAL MARIJUANA PROVISIONING CENTER, MARIJUANA MICRO BUSINESS OR MARIJUANA RETAILER SHOULD BE LOCATED WITHIN 600 FEET IN MARRIAGEMENT MEDICAL MARIJUANA PROVISIONING CENTER OR MEDICAL MARIJUANA RETAILER IS LOCATED. WITH THE AMENDMENT, THE SECTION WITH READ NO LOT CONTAINING A MEDICAL MARIJUANA PROVISIONING CENTER, MARIJUANA MICROBUSINESS, DESIGNATED MARIJUANA CONSUMPTION FACILITY OR MARIJUANA RETAILER SHALL BE LOCATED WITHIN 600 FEET OF ANY LOT ON WHICH A MEDICAL MARIJUANA PROVISIONING CENTER, MARIJUANA MICROBUSINESS DESIGNATED MARIJUANA CONSUMPTION FACILITY OR MARIJUANA RETAILERS LOCATED, I MOVE THAT AMENDMENT TO SECTION 5.16.3. G.F. BE MOVED.
04:14:54.665: >> Mayor Taylor: SECONDED BY. HAYNER. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
04:14:58.936: >> Councilmember Lumm: IT ADDS DESIGNATED MEDICAL MARIJUANA FACILITY TO THE LIST WHERE THERE'S A RESTRICTION ON LOCATION PROM I PROXIMITY TO ANR FACILITY. THE MICROBUSINESSES HAVE THE RESTRICTION ALREADY BUT DESIGNATED CONASSUMPTION FACILITIES DO NOT. THE PURPOSE OF THIS RESTRICTION IS TO LIMIT CONCENTRATION OF FACILITIES IN SPECIFIC AREAS AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT OBJECTIVE WOULD APPLY TO CONSUMPTION FACILITIES, AS WELL AS RETAILERS AND MICRO BUSINESSES. EACH OF THESE TYPES OF FACILITIES SELLERS AS WELL AS USE FACILITIES HAVE RETAIL COMPONENTS AND THE POTENTIAL SAFETY AND TRAFFIC CONCERNS THAT ARE THE REASONS TO LIMIT CONCENTRATION APPLY TO EACH. MR. LENART MENTIONED THAT THERE WOULD NOT BE MANY MANY REQUESTS FOR MEDICAL USE FACILITIES, AND THAT MAY BE RIGHT BUT THAT WAS JUST HIS SPECULATION AND IN THE EVENT THAT THERE'S STRONG DEMAND FOR DESIGNATED USE PERMITS, I THINK IT'S WISE FOR US TO APPLY THE SAME REGULATION -- REGULATIONS TO LIMIT CONCENTRATIONS FOR DESIGNATED USE THAT WE DO FOR PROVISIONING CENTER RETAILER AND FOR MICRO BUSINESS. THANK YOU.
04:16:08.171: >> Mayor Taylor: SIMILAR TO THE PRIOR AMENDMENT, MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE PEACE PASSAGE OF THIS AMENDMENT WOULD MEAN RETURN TO SECOND READING AND THUS EFFECTIVELY RESULTING IN US NOT HAVING THE REGULATIONS IN PLACE IN TIME FOR THE NOVEMBER 1 OF THE DEADLINE. FOR THAT REASON, AT LEAST, I'M GOING TO BE VOTING AGAINST THIS AMENDMENT AND I URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO DO THE SAME. FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
04:16:33.196: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THE INTERPRETATION OF IT. SO THE DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS, IS THAT FROM LIKE FACILITIES, MEANING THAT CONSUMPTION LOUNGES WOULD HAVE TO BE 1,000 FEET FROM CONSUMPTION LOUNGES BUT THEY COULD BE NEXT DOOR TO A RETAIL OUTLET?
04:16:54.618: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WILL BE VOTING NO AT THIS TIME BUT I WOULD LIKE TO BRING THIS TOPIC UP AGAIN.
04:17:00.057: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER NELSON?
04:17:02.526: >> Councilmember Nelson: MAYBE I MISHEARD YOU, COUNCILMEMBER LUMM. I THOUGHT YOU SAID 600 FEET.
04:17:10.200: >> Councilmember Lumm: 600.
04:17:10.801: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  I MISSPOKE.
04:17:12.903: >> Councilmember Lumm: IT'S SIMILAR TO WHAT THE RESTRICTIONS FOR ALL THE OTHERS.
04:17:15.172: >> Councilmember Nelson: GOVERN A. I THINK I HAVE A QUESTION FOR MR. LENART BECAUSE THERE WAS SORT OF A LOT OF BACK AND FORTH AT THE LAST MEETING. MY UNDERSTANDING WAS THAT THE CONSUMPTION FACILITIES WERE NOT ALLOWED OUTSIDE OF, LIKE D1, D2, AM. I MISREMEMBERING THAT?
04:17:33.123: >> THEY ARE GENERALLY ALLOWED IN THE RETAIL LOCATIONS, AND AT THAT MEETING, YOU ALSO AMENDED THAT TO ALLOW THEM TO COLLOCATE WITH RETAILERS AND PROVISIONING CENTERS SO MY INTERPRETATION OF THIS IS IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE FOR A CONSUMPTION FACILITY TO COLLOCATE WITH ONE OF THOSE ESTABLISHMENTS, HOWEVER, APART FROM THAT COLLOCATION, IT WOULD HAVE TO BE AT LEAST 600 FEET FROM ANOTHER SIMILAR USE.
04:18:00.684: >> Councilmember Nelson: OKAY. ALL RIGHT. I WILL HAVE TO LOOK UP MY NOTES AGAIN FROM THE LAST MEETING BECAUSE I THOUGHT I REMEMBERED THERE WAS -- THERE WAS ONE CATEGORY THAT WAS RESTRICTED TO D1, D2 AND I -- DO YOU REMEMBER --
04:18:18.835: >> ORIGORIGINALLY, THERE WAS SOE DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT, BUT LET ME CHECK THE NOTES. [ OFF MICROPHONE COMMENTS ]
04:18:52.736: >> YES, AS PROPOSED THEY ARE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USES IN THE C1B, D1, D2, AND SO ALL THE COMMERCIAL DISTRICTS.
04:19:02.179: >> Councilmember Nelson:  OH, ALL RIGHT. I GUESS I TOOK NOTE OF THE TOPIC THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY DISCUSSING, I'M -- I'M NOT OVERLY CONCERNED ABOUT THESE BUSINESSES CLUSTERING TOGETHER. I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS AMENDMENT. I'M JUST NOT -- I'M NOT OVERLY CONCERNED ABOUT IT, ABOUT THE IDEA OF THEM -- OF HAVING A DISTRICT THAT'S ALL CONSUMPTION FACILITIES. I DON'T SEE THAT POTENTIAL, THANKS.
04:19:25.936: >> Mayor Taylor: FOURTH DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE. STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER, ON THE AMENDMENT.
04:19:32.342: >> Councilmember Bannister: NO.
04:19:34.845: >> Councilmember Griswold: NO.
04:19:37.514: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES.
04:19:38.281: >> Councilmember Grand: NO.
04:19:38.882: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES.
04:19:41.718: >> Mayor Taylor: NO.
04:19:42.185: >> Councilmember Eaton: NO.
04:19:42.786: >> Councilmember Nelson:  NO.
04:19:45.055: >> Councilmember Smith: NO.
04:19:45.655: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: NEGATIVE.
04:19:47.324: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES.
04:19:48.859: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION FAILS.
04:19:50.694: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN MOTION? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
04:19:58.068: >> Councilmember Hayner: JUST -- I JUST THINK THAT IT'S A RIOT THAT WE ARE SITTING HERE DISCUSSING THIS AS IF PEOPLE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO MARIJUANA IN ANN ARBOR. DOES ANYBODY KNOW SOMEONE WHO SMOKES THAT CAN'T FIND MARIJUANA IN ANN ARBOR? THE HURRY TO PASS THESE THINGS IS NOT A HURRY TO ACT RESPONSIBLITY TO OUR COMMUNITY. I DON'T BUY THE NOTION THAT SOME PEOPLE HAVE PUT FORWARD THAT WE'RE SHOWING SOME KIND OF LEADERSHIP BY RUSHING INTO THIS. AND SO THESE ARTIFICIAL DEADLINES THAT HAVE BEEN SET, REALLY BY US, BY NOT ACTING ON IT SOONER, THEY ARE NOT RINGING TRUE WITH ME. I THINK THERE'S -- I THINK THERE'S REASONS TO, YOU KNOW, EITHER LIMIT THE NUMBER OF THESE FACILITIES IN A UNIFORM WAY, LIKE I SUGGESTED LAST WEEK, OR REMOVE THE LIMITS COMPLETELY. BECAUSE RIGHT NOW, IT'S ARBITRARY AND I THINK IT'S GOING TO OPEN US OPEN TO POTENTIAL LAWSUITS FROM FOLKS WOULD WANT IN ON THE BUSINESS, AND I MEAN, I KNOW THAT FAILED LAST WEEK AT THE READING AND I'M AFRAID IT WILL FAIL THIS TIME BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO MESS WITH IT AND SEND IT BACK TO THE FIRST READING AND WE WON'T HAVE TIME TO SELL OUR MARIJUANA. AND SO, YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE ABOUT THIS AND I DON'T KNOW THE LEGAL REMEDY FOR, YOU KNOW THIS GETTING PASSED TONIGHT AGAINST MY WISHES AND COMING BACK AND CHANGING THOSE NUMBERS IN THE FUTURE AND CHANGING THE LOCATION OF THESE. I MEAN, I THINK THAT EVERYBODY KNOWS AND IS FAIRLY CONFIDENT THAT ONCE THE LID IS OFF OF THIS, HOW DO WE COME BACK AND RESTRICT THESE PLACES WITHOUT OPENING OURSELVES UP TO ALL KINDS OF SUITS IF THE -- IF 1200 PLUS COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE OPTED OUT ALREADY HERE IN THE STATE. I KNOW IPSI IS IN, NO THEY WILL SO THEY WILL HAVE THEIR OWN THING GOING. PEOPLE WILL BE LOOKING TO THE CITY FOR GOOD AND BAD. AND FIRST OF ALL, I'M DISAPPOINTED THAT WE COULDN'T PUT MODERATE RESTRICTIONS IN PLACE. YEAH, I'M NOT THEY  THRILLED WIL OF THIS AND I WISH WE COULD HAVE TAKEN THE TIME TO GET THIS TOGETHER. YOU CAN SEE THAT AND OUR CONVERSATIONS EVEN PEOPLE HAVE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE ARE GOING BACK TO OUR NOTES. WE ARE NOT REALLY SURE WHAT WE ARE DOING. I MAY SPEAK MORE IN A MOMENT.
04:22:31.955: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
04:22:33.490: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER AND COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN, FOR WHAT YOU -- FOR YOUR OBSERVATIONS AND SUPPORT FOR GIVING THIS THE NEEDED SOAK TIME. AS I SAID, SEVERAL TIMES OUT AT THE LAST MEETING AND AGAIN TONIGHT, I BELIEVE THAT APPROVING THESE ORDINANCES BOTH B-3 AND B-4 TONIGHT IS PREMATURE AND THAT WE HAVE NOT DONE THE PROPER DUE DILIGENCE OR TAKEN THE TIME NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE GETTING THIS RIGHT. AND I DON'T THINK THAT THE SKY IS FALLING, CHICKEN LITTLE, BEING -- I DON'T KNOW. IT'S DOING DUE DILIGENCE. AND I'M REALLY DISAPPOINTED THAT TRYING TO DO SOME DUE DILIGENCE COMES UNDER SUCH CRITICISM. RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA IS COMING TO ANN ARBOR. THE CITY AND THE COUNCIL HAVE CLEARLY DECLARED THE INTENT TO ALLOW THE FACILITIES PERMITTED BY THE STATE TO OPERATE IN ANN ARBOR AND IT WILL BE COMING RELATIVELY SOON. IT'S NOT A MATTER OF IF, BUT EXACTLY WHEN AND UNDER WHAT SET OF SPECIFIC REGULATIONS. I WILL JUST SAY THAT BECAUSE OF THE CONCERNS NOTED THAT -- ABOUT THE TWO AMENDMENTS THAT I WAS PROPOSING, THAT THESE ARE MATERIAL CHANGES AND WE WOULD REVERT THIS TO A -- THE SECOND READING INTO A FIRST READING. I WILL REINTRODUCE THESE, BUT AS NOTED BY COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, THEY ARE GOING TO COME AFTER WE ARE ISSUING PERMITS. SO ANY OF THESE POSSIBLE AMENDMENTS WON'T APPLY TO THE PEOPLE COMING IN THE DOOR ON NOVEMBER 1st BECAUSE I THINK WE NEED MORE TIME. OBVIOUSLY THAT'S WHY I SPONSORED C-4, WHICH IS THE TEMPORARY OPT OUT TO SEPTEMBER 16th. DECEMBER. THAT'S 45 DAYS AFTER NOVEMBER 1st, WHEN THE STATE WILL BEGIN ACCEPTING APPLICATIONS. 45 DAYS IS NOT A GREAT DEAL OF TIME IN THE GRAND SCHEME OF THINGS BUT IT WOULD BE SUFFICIENT TIME ACCORDING TO STAFF TO ALLOW FURTHER EVALUATION. I WON'T REPEAT ALL THE COMMENTS I HAVE FOR C-4 AND WHY THE CITY NEEDS A BIT MORE TIME, BUT THEY ARE SIGNIFICANT. TIME TO UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS FOR APPROVING INITIAL PERMITS AND RENEWALS. TIME TO GENUINELY ENGAGE RESIDENTS BEING TIME TO TALK WITH THEM AND LEARN FROM OTHER COMMUNITIES LIKE BOULDER WHO HAVE LIVED THIS AND TIME TO TAKE A DEEP DIVE INTO THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION OF HOW MANY FACILITIES ARE APPROPRIATE FOR ANN ARBOR. SOMEONE WILL SAY, WE CAN JUST SORT THIS ALL OUT FOR YOU LATER AND MAKE CHANGES WE MAY NEED TO MAKE LATER. THAT'S NOT THE WAY TO APPROACH SOMETHING AS IMPORTANT AS THIS. YOU DON'T JUST KICK THAT CAN. AND WE NEED TO REMEMBER THAT ONCE PERMITS ARE GRANTED UNDER ONE SET OF RULES AND REGULATIONS, THEY CANNOT BE REVOKED, BECAUSE WE CHANGE THE RULES. SO I DO OBVIOUSLY NOT THINK THAT THESE ORDINANCES ARE READY AT THIS POINT AND FOR THAT REASON, I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING THEM TONIGHT. THANKS.
04:25:51.354: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
04:25:52.255: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, MAYOR TAYLOR. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK AND I ACTUALLY ASKED THE CLERK TO ADD ME AS A COSPONSOR TO THIS I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO CONTINUE TO LEAD, TO MOVE THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT'S COME UPON US IN THE LAST 45 DAYS OR 90 DAYS. THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON IN OUR COMMUNITY FOR 50 YEARS. I THINK, AGAIN, THE MESSAGE WILL BE ONE OF WEAKNESS IF WE CLASS WE CHOOSETO OPT OUT. AGAIN, THERE'S NOTHING PERFECT. THIS' THE NARRATIVE OF THE SKY IS GOING TO BE FALLING AND ALL OF THESE TERRIBLE THINGS ARE GOING TO BE HAPPENING. FRANKLY, I HAVE NOT HEARD THIS FROM OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS. I HAVE NOT SEEN IT WITH THE MEDICAL MARIJUANA BUSINESSES. I'M KIND OF OFFENDED BY MY COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER ON THE END, MY COLLEAGUE ACCUSING PEOPLE WHO SMOKE MARIJUANA OF APPLYING GRAFFITI AND DOING ALL OF THESE THINGS. HOW DO WE KNOW THIS? YOU KNOW, IN FACT, I ■HAVEA GOOD FRIEND OF MINE WHO HAD HIS MOTHER AND FATHER WIPED OUT BY A DRUNK DRIVER IN SAN FRANCISCO THIS WEEKEND. YOU KNOW, ARE WE CALLING FOR PROHIBITION NOW? I MEAN, HOW MANY DEATHS OCCUR A YEAR FROM ALCOHOL? BUT YET IT'S CELEBRATED. AND SO, YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST -- IT'S JUST -- TO ME, IT'S NOT CONVINCING AND THIS DOES HAVE ISSUES, BUT THESE ARE THINGS THAT CAN BE WORKED THROUGH WITH A RESOLUTION THAT COUNCILMEMBER LUMM HAS PUT FORTH LATER IN THIS AGENDA, DC-3, ESTABLISHs MARIJUANA COMMISSION AND COMMITTEE TO LOOK AT THE PROBLEMS AND ADDRESS THEM, RESPONSIBLY. BUT, YOU KNOW, THE FACT IS, I WAS OVER HERE NOT TOO LONG AGO, WHEN WE DISCUSSED ROAD DIETS. THAT TOOK MORE THAN 45 DAYS. THAT WAS TRAVERWOOD, FOR ONE STREET. AND YOU THINK WE'RE GOING TO GET IT ALL FIGURED OUT IN 45 DAYS? I DON'T THINK SO. I HIGHLY DOUBT SO. SO MUCH SO THAT I'M NOT GOING ALONG WITH IT. THIS COUNCIL HAS NOT SHOWN THAT IT CAN ACT THAT FAST. THE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE, NEEDS TO BE DONE THROUGH THE COMMISSION, THAT WE NEED TO SET UP AND EVALUATE THE ISSUES ONE BY ONE. I FIND THESE FEARS COMPLETELY UNFOUNDED.
04:28:48.965: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
04:28:51.567: >> Councilmember Eaton: ANN ARBOR HAS ADULT MEDICAL MARIJUANA ALREADY GOING ON. THESE PROVIDE A REGULATED BUSINESS WHERE SAFE PRODUCT WILL BE SOLD IN SECURE FACILITIES. WE ARE NOT GOING TO CHANGE THE AVAILABILITY OF MARIJUANA. WE ARE GOING TO CHANGE THE QUALITY OF THE MARIJUANA THAT'S SOLD, AND THE ABILITY TO SECURE THE SELLER FROM THEFT IN OTHER CRIMES. THIS IS NOT AN ENORMOUS CHANGE IN THIS CITY. THE STATE HAS PROVIDED SUBSTANTIAL REGULATION OF THIS BUSINESS, AND THOSE PEOPLE WHO ENGAGE IN THIS BUSINESS HAVE TO FOLLOW THOSE REGULATIONS OR SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES OF LOSING THEIR STATE PERMIT. SO WE AREN'T RUSHING INTO THINGS. IT ISN'T SOMETHING DANGEROUS. WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE ARE ACTUALLY ESTABLISHING A SET OF REGULATIONS FOR BUSINESSES THAT ALREADY EXIST THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. AND SO I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU ANY DELAY TO DESCRIBE HOW MANY FEET WE HAVE TO BE APART FROM EACH OTHER, WHEN WE SELL MARIJUANA, OR THE PROXIMITY TO OTHER BUSINESSES. REALLY IT'S REASON TO STALL THIS. WE SHOULD GO FORWARD AND LEGALIZE A HIGHLY REGULATED SAFE BUSINESS PRACTICE. AND WATCH HOW IT DEVELOPS. I HAVE NOT SEEN SIGNIFICANT PROPROBLEMS SURROUNDING OR MEDIL MARIJUANA FACILITIES. AND I EXPECT THAT WE ARE REALLY ENGAGING IN CONSIDERABLE SPECULATION WHEN WE BELIEVE THAT THIS BUSINESS IS GOING TO CAUSE US PROBLEMS BEYOND WHAT WE ALREADY EXPERIENCED. SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS.
04:30:58.327: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
04:30:59.262: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I THINK GENERALLY, I'M GLAD THAT THE STATE AND OUR CITY WILL BE MOVING FORWARD WITH RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA. I THINK HISTORY HAS PROVEN, PUBLIC HEALTH RESEARCH HAS PROVE THAN PROHIBITIONS DON'T WORK. I THINK IT'S A LONG OVERDUE STEP. I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE DONE CAREFULLY AND WELL AND I'M GLAD THAT THERE WERE, YOU KNOW, A AMENDMENTS TONIGHT THAT AT LEAST PREVIEW WHAT FUTURE QUALITY REGULATIONS COULD LOOK LIKE. AND I WILL BE EXCITED TO SUPPORT THOSE AMENDMENTS IN THE FUTURE. I THINK ULTIMATELY, I WILL BE VOTING FOR THIS TONIGHT AND THE WAY THAT I UNDERSTAND THE STATE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK TO BE CREATED IS THAT THE LACK OF ANY LOCAL REGULATIONS WILL, IN FACT, CREATE MORE OF A VACUUM THAT I DON'T NECESSARILY WANT TO TEST AND SO I WOULD RATHER HAVE SOMETHING ON THE BOOKS THAN NOTHING. SO I WILL ULTIMATELY BE SUPPORTING THIS BUT LOOK FORWARD TO WORK WITH COUNCILMEMBER LUMM TO BRING FORWARD SOME OF THESE SMALL INCRE INCREMENTAL REGULATS THAT WILL BE POSITIVE FOR THE FUTURE.
04:32:13.669: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
04:32:15.705: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I THINK I'M INSPIRED BY COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN'S COMMENTS. I STOOD ON THE STAGE OF HASH BASH, BECAUSE I SUPPORTED THE DECRIMINALIZATION OF PROP ONE AND I SUPPORTED THE RESPONSIBLE LEGISLATION THAT WAS GOING TO ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN IN OUR COMMUNITY. AND AS COUNCILMEMBER EATON JUST SAID, WE ALL KNOW -- AND I WAS ALLUDING TO THAT EARLIER. WE ALREADY KNOW THAT IT'S HAPPENING IN OUR COMMUNITY. THERE'S NO MYSTERY ABOUT THAT AND THE CHANGES THAT THIS STATE AND LOCAL REGULATORY STRUCTURE IS GOING TO BRING IS JUST GOING TO SORT OF, YOU KNOW, FIRM THAT UP AND ALSO, YOU KNOW, KIND OF KICK A PITTANCE BACK TO US IN TAXED REVENUE. WE HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT WHERE WE ARE -- HOW WE ARE GOING TO SPEND THAT TAX MONEY YET. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE AN AMENDMENT THAT DISCUSSES THAT, BUT, YOU KNOW, NO BE IS CELEBRATING ALCOHOL AT THIS TABLE. AND I -- SOME OF MY CONCERNS ARE THAT I SPENT TIME IN OTHER COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE LEGALIZED MARIJUANA. AND IT'S -- IT IS A CHANGE IN THE CULTURE, WHEN YOU LOOK IN THE -- WHEN YOU LOOK IN THE ADVERTISING, THE PERIODICALS, THE WHOLE BACK SECTION IS MARIJUANA ADVERTISING. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE NEWSPAPER IT'S MARIJUANA ADVERTISING AND GIANT POT LEAVES AND SO ON AND SO ON. IT'S OKAY FOR SOME AND NOT FOR OTHERS AND SOME OF THOSE OTHERS HAVE REACHED OUT TO US PRIVATELY, AND SAID IT ISN'T OKAY WITH THEM. AND OBVIOUSLY, THIS IS GOING FORWARD. MY DISCOMFORT IS NOT THE FABLING THAT MARIJUANA EXISTS IN OUR COMMUNITY. OBVIOUSLY IT DOES. IT'S WITH THE FACT THAT WE DON'T SEEM TO BE SHOWING THE RESPONSIBILITY AND CARE FOR ESTABLISHING THE LOCAL AUTHORITY OVER IT THAT I THINK IS APPROPRIATE FOR OUR POSITION HERE ON CITY COUNCIL. AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE BOULDERS -- THE PREAMBLES TO BOULDER'S RESOLUTIONS, THEY SAY THAT THESE LAWS ARE TO PROTECT THE GREATER GOOD OF THE COMMUNITY, NOT ONLY TO ESTABLISH THESE BUSINESSES, BUT TO ESTABLISH THE ENVIRONMENT FOR WHICH THESE BUSINESSES CAN SAFELY AND REASONABLY OPERATE. I -- I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S WHERE THIS IS RIGHT NOW. I'M JUST -- AND I DON'T NEED THE CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS THAT COME WITH IT. IN 2013, SABER GOT A THIRD OF HER MONEY CAME FROM MEDICAL MARIJUANA FUND-RAISERS. WHILE SHE SAT ON THE MEDICAL MARIJUANA LICENSE REVIEW BOARD AND SO THIS IS NOT A MONEY ISSUE FOR ME. I DIDN'T GET ANY OF THAT. AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST -- I DON'T THINK WE'RE DOING OUR DUE DILIGENCE, AND SO, YOU KNOW, I WILL BE HAPPY THAT IT PASSES. I HOPE THE STATE DOES MORE WITH DECRIMINALIZATION EFFORTS AND EXPUNKMENT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO JAIL TORE SMOKING A JOINT. I THINK IT'S ALWAYS BEEN WRONG SINCE I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL. I LOOK FORWARD TO THOSE BENEFITS COMING TO OUR STATE AND I ALSO LOOK FORWARD TO ADDING SOME REASONABLE RESPONSIBLE LEGISLATION AROUND OUR LOCAL
04:35:27.530: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER - - OH, COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
04:35:35.304: >> Councilmember Bannister:  I WOULD LIKE TO SHOW MY SUPPORT FOR THE INDUSTRY AND I WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A COSPONSOR WITH RAMLAWI AND TAYLOR.
04:35:44.346: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
04:35:46.582: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. THERE'S JUST BEEN A LOT OF ALLEGATIONS THAT WE'RE NOT DOING OUR DUE DILIGENCE AND THAT WE ARE RUSHING TO THINGS AND PUTTING THE PUBLIC AT RISK AND IN DANGER AND I WANT TO PUSH BACK A LITTLE BIT. I MEAN THE STATE HAS GIVEN US OVER 60 PAGES OF GUIDE LINES, RULES, REGULATIONS. THEY HAVE DONE A LOT OF THE HEAVY LIFTING. A LOT OF IT HAS BEEN VETTED OUT AND FURTHERMORE, OUR LEGAL DEPARTMENT HAS WORKED WITH US. THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING HARD ON THIS FOR THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS. I THINK IF THEY THOUGHT WE WERE PUTTING THE CITY IN JEOPARDY, THEY RUN VERY CONSECUTIVE AS WE KNOW. AND FOR THEM TO ALLOW THIS TO GO FORTH WITHOUT ANY MAJOR RESERVATIONS, IT LEAVES ME WITH COMFORT THAT I'M NOT RUSHING FOR JUDGMENT AND I'M NOT PUTTING THE PUBLIC AT UNDUE RISK AND THAT A LOT OF THESE CONCERNS THAT KEEP GETTING RAISED AS WE FIND OUT LATER AS WE THUMB THROUGH THE STATE MANUAL, STATE STATUTE, THEY ARE ALREADY ADDRESSED. SO I THINK -- IF PEOPLE ARE RUSHING TO JUDGMENT, IT'S NOT THE FOLKS THAT ARE IN FAVOR OF THIS ORDINANCE RIGHT NOW. SO I WOULD JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT. THANK YOU.
04:37:00.523: >> Mayor Taylor: FOURTH ERFURTHR DISCUSSION? I'M GLAD THIS IS MOVING FORWARD. I THINK IT'S PLAINLY SOMETHING TAG THE FOLKS IN ANN ARBOR, THE COMMUNITY OF ANN ARBOR WANTS AND I THINK THE SOLUTION THAT WE HAVE DEVISED IS ORDERLY, AND WE'LL MEET. COMMUNITY'S NEEDS AND DO SO IN A TEMPERED REASONABLE MANNER. I WOULD LIKE TO PIGGYBACKING A LITTLE BIT ON WHAT COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI HAD TO SAY. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK AND CREDIT THE INCREDIBLE HARD WORK DONE BY THE ATTORNEY STAFF, BY PLANNING STAFF, BY FOLKS ON THE PLANNING COMMISSION GETTING THIS TO US. IT CAME TO US FAIRLY QUICKLY BUT IT CAME TO US FAIRLY QUICKLY AFTER A LOT OF WORK AND A LOT OF SLOW, DELIBERATE WORK PERFORMED BY THOSE -- BY THOSE FOLKS, ONCE THE STATE GUIDELINES LANDED. IT WAS -- IT WAS A FLEURY OF -- FLURRY OF WORK FOR WEEKS, IF NOT MONTHS BEFORE WE SAW THE END PRODUCT AND THE END PRODUCT WE HAVE IS REASONABLE. IT MEETS THE COMMUNITY'S NEEDS AND IT MEETS THE COMMUNITY'S DESIRES AND INSTRUCTIONS WE WERE TO THE SALE OF LEGALIZED MARIJUANA AND I THINK THAT -- AND I THINK WE ARE DOING THE RIGHT THING HERE. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
04:38:18.334: >> Councilmember Lumm: THIS IS FOR THE JOHN Q. PUBLIC OUT THERE. SO I DIDN'T COME UP WITH THE DECEMBER 16th DATE. STAFF DID. I ASKED THEM WHAT THEY WOULD RECOMMEND, WHAT THEY NEEDED AND SO DESPITE ALL THE SMOKE, DESPITE WHAT YOU JUST HEARD, IT'S NOT A JANE LUMM RECOMMENDATION. I SOUGHT GUIDANCE TO GET THIS RIGHT, AND DECEMBER 16th WAS THE DATE THAT WAS RECOMMENDED. RECOMMENDED BY STAFF.

04:39:42.851: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES.

04:40:32.101: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  IF I COULD ASK CHIEF KENNEDY A QUICK QUESTION IF HE'S STILL HERE. I NOTICED THAT THIS PERTAINS TO RESIDENCE. IN TERMS OF -- I SPOKE WITH YOU A FEW WEEKS AGO, IT'S ABOUT GOOD MARE CSAMARITAN LAW, SOMEONE WAY A HOUSE WHERE THE ALARM IS GOING OFF AND THEY CALL THE FIRE DEPARTMENT AND IT'S A FALSE ALARM. THE CURRENT WAY OF THINGS IS THAT THAT HOMEOWNER IS ASSESSED A CHARGE. THIS IS A MOVE TO REMOVE THAT, CORRECT?
04:41:05.000: >> CORRECT.
04:41:05.334: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: NOW, IS IT GOING TO BE APPLICABLE TO BUSINESSES OR OTHER TYPES OF DWELLINGS THAT FALL UNDER THE SAME SITUATION WHERE, YOU KNOW, THE BUSINESSES HAS AN ALARM GOING OFF, AND SOMEONE ELSE CALLED IT IN?
04:41:24.053: >> SO THE ORDINANCE DOES NOT SPECIAL RESIDENTIAL OR COMMERCIAL. THERE ARE SOME JUST FROM A TECHNICAL CLARIFICATION STANDPOINT. THERE ARE SOME COMMERCIAL SYSTEMS FOR SPRINKLER SYSTEMS THAT WILL HAVE AN EXTERNAL WATER GONG THAT'S MEANT SOLELY FOR THE IDEA TO ALERT -- IT'S A NON-MONITORED SYSTEM, WHICH MEANS IT'S NOT GOING TO AN ADT OR A BRINKS BUT IT HAS AN EXTERNAL GONG TO LITERALLY ALERT PEOPLE. SO IF IT WAS THAT SITUATION, WHERE IT WAS THE SYSTEM WAS DESIGNING AS INTENDED TO ALERT NEARBY PEOPLE, THEN THE SYSTEM WAS DOING WHAT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO DO. THIS WAS REALLY MEANT FOR, LIKE, THE SMOKE DETECTOR CHIRPING THE BATTERY. WE ALWAYS TRY TO SIDE IN FAVOR OF EITHER THE RESIDENT OR THE BUSINESS WHENEVER POSSIBLE. THE POLICY REALLY RESTRAINED US. SO IT GIVES STAFF SOME MORE LEE WAY, WHAT WAS THE INTENT.
04:42:20.676: >> Mayor Taylor: OKAY. THANK YOU.
04:42:24.446: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: OKAY. THANK YOU.
04:42:26.448: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. ALL IN FAVOR,. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? AS APPROVED. C-2 AN ORDINANCE ATO AMEND SECTION 5.13.9, 5.17.4, 5.18.6, 5.28.1, 5.28.6, 5.29.10, AND 5.30.1, AND 5.37.2 CHAPTER 55 OF THE UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE OF THE TITLE 5 OF THE CODE OF THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. DISCUSSION OF C-2, COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
04:42:56.178: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  I WANT TO START BY FRAMING THE CONVERSATION QUICKLY. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S INCREDIBLY NEAR AND DEAR TO ME. IT'S SOMETHING I HOPED TO ACCOMPLISH WITH THE HELP OF OTHERS THE LAST FOUR YEARS OF MY TENURE ON COUNCIL AND ONLY NOW AFTER LEGISLATIVE CHANGES AT THE STATE LEVEL AT THE END OF LAST YEAR HAS THIS CONVERSATION BECOME A POSSIBILITY. AND I JUST WANT TO SAY THIS IS A RESULT OF A LOT OF TREMENDOUS WORK ON BEHALF OF THE PLANNING STAFF AND THE PLANNING COMMISSION. AS WELL AS WITH INPUT FROM THE ANN ARBOR HOUSING COMMISSION, FOLKS AT AVALON AND REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY, BOTH ON THE ARE  ARCHITECTURAL SIDE ANDE FINANCING SIDE AND I ALSO JUST WANT TO SAY, NO PRIDE OF AUTHORSHIP, SO PLEASE ASK QUESTIONS TONIGHT. PUSH BACK. AND, YOU KNOW, EITHER SECOND READING NEXT TIME WE'LL DEAL WITH IT OR HOWEVER LONG IT TAKES. BUT HOPEFULLY WE CAN MAKE SOME INCREMENTAL CHANGES THAT WILL MAKE A REALITY POSITIVE IMPACT ON OUR DOWNTOWN AND OUR COMMUNITY. SO BACK IN MARCH, I WAS GLAD TO BRING FORWARD A RESOLUTION TO REEXAMINE AND HOPEFULLY INFORM THE WAY WE INCENTIVIZE DOWNTOWN DEVELOPMENT. OVER THE PAST FIVE MONTHS, THE PLANNING COMMISSION HAS BEEN WORKING TO MAKE THAT REQUEST A REALITY. SO HOW DID WE GET TO WHERE WE ARE TODAY? SO FIRST IN 2010, THE CITY UNDERTOOK A LARGE REZONING OF OUR DOWNTOWN IN THESE CHANGES THE CITY SIMPLIFIED ZONING DESIGNATIONS, SIMPLIFIED ZONING DESIGNATIONS THE D1 AND THE D2 DISTRICTS TODAY. AS PART OF THAT INITIATIVE, THERE WERE A SET OF INCENTIVES OR PREMIUMS TO HELP OUR COMMUNITY REALIZE THE KIND OF CONSTRUCTION THAT IT WANTED. SO EXAMPLES OF THIS WERE DOWNTOWN RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION AND SUSTAINABLE BUILDING AND CONNECTIVITY, AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND I THINK IN THE LAST TEN YEARS THIS HAVE BEEN A LOT OF SUCCESSES AND OUR INCREASED DOWNTOWN POPULATION HAS CREATED A LOT OF VIBRANCY AND IT'S CREATED MORE RESILIENT MARKET FOR RETAIL, DESPITE A LOT OF DESTRUCTIVE CHANGES LIKE AMAZON AND IT'S TRYING TO KEEP UP WITH U OF M'S INCREASED ENROLLMENT. ALSO DOWNTOWN CONSTRUCTION IS MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT THAN WE HAVE SEEN IN THE PAST, WHICH IS GREAT BUT I THINK IT'S TEN YEARS LATER NOW AND WE NEED TO LOOK BACK, LEARN AND IMPROVE. SO AS WE LOOKED BACK OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS WE HAVE SEEN A VERY CLEAR PATTERN OF DEVELOPMENT. ALMOST EVERY DEVELOPMENT IS 90% RESIDENTIAL, RIGHT? AND WE REALLY INCENTIVIZE PEOPLE TO BUILD MORE THAN 40% RESIDENTIAL. SO WE HAVE LEARNED NOW THAT THAT'S ESSENTIALLY INCENTIVIZING SOMETHING THAT DEVELOPERS WANT TO DO ANYWAYS. AT THE SAME TIME, WE HAVE APRIL AFFORDABILITY PREMIUM, BUT ONLY NOW TEN YEARS INTO IT, NINE YEARS INTO IT, ARE WE SEEING TWO PROPOSALS FOR FIRST TIME UTILIZE THAT PREMIUM. SO THAT MAKES YOU WANT TO, YOU KNOW, SCRATCH YOUR HEAD A LITTLE BIT. WHY ARE WE INCENTIVIZING WHAT DEVELOPERS AND FINANCIERS WANT TO BUILD ANYWAYS AND IN THE MIDST OF A HOUSING CRISIS, AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS, WHY ARE WE ONLY SEEING TWO DEVELOPMEMENTS TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT PREMIUM. I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW TO ASK THOSE QUESTIONS AND IN THIS AMENDMENT, IT SEEKS AN ANSWER. SO FIRST IT ELIMINATES THE RESIDENTIAL ZONING PREMIUM. IT CUTS AND ROLLS BACK AN INCENTIVE OF SOMETHING THAT DEVELOPERS ALREADY WANT TO BUILD. AND THIS IT REPLACES THAT BY GREATLY STRENGTHENING OUR EXPECTATIONS FOR HOW MUCH AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE DEMAND FOR THE AMOUNT OF ADDED DENSITY WE PROVIDE THROUGH OUR PREMIUMS. TO PUT IT INTO SCALE, THE TWO PROPOSALS, THEY WILL HAVE BETWEEN 9 AND 10% OF THEIR COMMUNITIES BE AFFORDABLE. THIS WILL SET A MINIMUM OF 15% AND UP TO 30%. SO EVEN AT A MINIMUM, WE ARE GOING TO BE EXCEEDING THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING PREMIUM WE GET TOGETHER. THIRD IT BRINGS THE INCOME LEVEL FROM 60% TO 80%. SO IT GETS TO OUR GOAL THAT WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT ALL THREE YEARS WHAT IS THE IMPACT? WE ARE TAKING AWAY A LUCRATIVE PREMIUM AND MUCH NOR AGGRESSIVE AFFORDABILITY PREMIUM AND WE ARE CHANGING THE REQUIREMENT FOR HOW AFFORDABLE IT REALLY NEEDS TO BE AND IN THIS WAY, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HOSPITAL TECHNICIANS AND THE LIKE. THREE MINUTES. I TRIED TO SPEAK QUICKLY. I WANT TO -- COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER AND COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, YOU RAISED EXPLICIT CONCERNS. YOU WERE FEARFUL OF INCREASED HEIGHT THAT THIS MIGHT CAUSE, AND COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, YOU WERE CONCERNED ABOUT PARKING. AND SO BOTH, I THINK COME BACK WITH TEMPERED APPROACHES TO BOTH OF THOSE CONSIDERATIONS ON THE HEIGHT SIDE IN ORDER TO GET ABOVE 180 FEET. YOU HAVE TO PROVIDE 30% OF YOUR BUILDING AS AFFORDABLE, WHICH WOULD TRANSLATE INTO ABOUT 50 UNITS BASED ON CALCULATIONS.
04:47:56.178: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER.
04:47:56.845: >> Councilmember Ackerman: AND IT WOULD ONLY WAIVE PARKING FOR AT FORWARDABLE UNITS. IT WOULD MAINTAIN THE PARKING REQUIRE FOR OTHER MARKET RATE. ASK QUESTIONS AND WE'LL WORK TOGETHER.
04:48:08.423: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER? FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
04:48:17.098: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: JUST TO SAY THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORTH, ALL THE -- I REMEMBER ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THAT YOU TOLD ME AFTER WINNING SEAT WAS GOVERNMENT MOMOVES INCREDIBLY SO. I'M GLAD YOU HAVE BEEN PERSISTENT AND HERE LONG ENOUGH TO SEE THIS. I'M SURE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS THAT MY CONSTITUENTS WILL RAISE AND THAT I HAVE -- I DON'T KNOW YET. BUT THANK YOU FOR THAT AND I THINK, COUNCILMEMBER LUMM SAID YOU DESERVE MORE THAN THREE MINUTES. THIS IS VERY COMPLICATED. AND I WOULD DEFER MY TIME IF YOU WANT TO CONTINUE TO EXPLAIN IT.
04:49:01.610: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
04:49:04.045: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANKS. I WANT TO THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN FOR THAT THOROUGH DEBRIEF ON THIS. SO THANK YOU FOR THAT INTRODUCTION AND THANK YOU FOR ALL OF YOUR WORK ON THIS. I DO SUPPORT THE INTENT HERE. IT NEVER MADE SENSE TO ME THAT WE DIDN'T -- THAT WE WOULD INCENTIVE MARKET RATE HOUSING, WHERE DEVELOPERS DON'T NEED AN INCENTIVE. PLUS WHEN I ASKED ABOUT THE SPECIFIC LEVELS IN THE ORDINANCE, THE REQUIRED AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND THE RESULTING F.A.R. PREMIUMS AND THE RESPONSES DEMONSTRATED TO ME ANYWAY THAT THIS WAS VERY WELL THOUGHT OUT. AND I THINK IT'S ALSO GOOD TO SEE THE REQUIREMENT THAT AT LEAST HALF OF THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING ACTUALLY NEEDS TO BE IN THE PROJECT. IT CAN'T BE, YOU KNOW, 100% PAYMENT IN LIEU. SO THAT'S A GOOD THING. THANKS FOR BRINGING UP THE PARKING. I DID ASK A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT. I ASKED ABOUT THE OFF-STREET PARKING REQUIREMENT AND HOW THAT WOULD WORK. STAFF'S RESPONSE WAS PARKING'S EXPENSIVE. SO NOT HAVING THAT REQUIREMENT REDUCES COSTS AND ULTIMATE AFFORDABILITY AND COUNCIL SPECIFICALLY DIRECTED THE PLANNING COMMISSION TO REDUCE PARKING REQUIREMENTS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING PREMIUMS. AGAIN, I MEAN, IT'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE THIS WAS WELL THOUGHT OUT. SO THERE MAY BE ISSUES AT THE PUBLIC HEARING THAT I'M NOT AWARE OF, BUT I'M -- I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS AT FIRST READING TONIGHT. THANKS.
04:50:33.301: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
04:50:35.837: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU. SO -- AND I APPRECIATE THE EXPLANATION THAT COUNCILMAN ACKERMAN OFFERED. SO I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS AND THEY WERE MOSTLY ANSWERED SO I APPRECIATE THAT TOO. ONE OF THE CONCERNS ABOUT INCENTIVIZING PARKING OR INCENTIVIZING NO PARKING I HAVE AND THIS WILL PROBABLY COME UP IN THE INTERVENING TWO WEEKS IS WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE YOU MAY HAVE SEEN THE RESPONSE. WE TALKED ABOUT THE D.D.A. COMING TO US FOR A NEW PARKING STRUCTURE OF HOW MANY SPACES WE GIVE AWAY IN THESE STRUCTURES TO DEVELOPERS BECAUSE WE DON'T OFFER -- WE ARE TRYING TO DO AWAY WITH THE PARKING MINIMUMS AND THEY ARE TAKING THEM OUT OF THE CITY STRUCTURES, WHICH I DON'T THINK IS A GREAT SITUATION. MORE TO THE AFFORDABILITY ON THIS. I THINK IT'S A GREAT STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND I APPRECIATE IT COMING FORWARD. MY CONCERN, I THINK IT'S GOOD WE LOWERED FROM 80 TO 60 A.M.I. SOME OF THEM SAY THAT 30% A.M.I. IS AAFFORDABLE HOUSING. THAT'S GENUINE PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING HOURLY JOBS FOR NOT GREAT PAGES, IS 3%, AND I MEAN, I COULD GIVE YOU EXAMPLES FROM MY OWN LIFE, FROM NEIGHBORS' LIVES AND THINGS AND THINGS CHANGE IN PEOPLE'S LIVES. I DON'T THINK 60% OF WASHTENAW COUNTY AREA'S MEDIAN INCOME WOULD BE CONSIDERED AFFORDABLE BY MOST OF THE NATION. I KNOW WE HAVE TO SET AND WORK WITH WHAT WE HAVE, BUT I THINK 60 IS TOO HIGH. I THINK THAT THE A.M.I. SHOULD BE LOWERED. TO RESPECT THE REALITY OF THE TYPES OF JOBS THAT WE HAVE HERE, AND THE TYPES OF PEOPLE WHO CAN'T AFFORD TO LIVE HERE. AND I THINK IT'S GOOD THAT WE ARE DOING WHAT WE HAVE. IT'S MORE THAN INSIDE THE FREEWAY RING, AND IT DEALS WITH THE COUNTY AND THE REGION, BUT I THINK WE CAN DO A LITTLE MORE TO LOWER THAT A.M.I., AND I WOULD CERTAINLY SUPPORT LOWERING THAT A.M.I. NUMBER, BECAUSE I -- WHAT I THINK IS IT'S KEEPING THE -- I UNDERSTAND -- I'M JUST GOING OUT ON A LIMB HERE AND GUESSING THAT PLANNING FELT THAT 60% A.M.I. WAS REASONABLE ENOUGH TO INCENTIVIZE THE DEVELOPER TO STILL GET A DECENT PROFIT OFF THESE UNITS EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE RENTING THEM. IF THEY REPRESENT IT AT 40% A.M.I. OR THEY GET STATE VOUCHERS AND THINGS. I UNDERSTAND WHERE THAT 60 CAME FROM, BUT I WANT TO THROW IT OUT THERE, THAT I MADE SOME PROMISES TO HOLD THAT LINE AND 60 IS TOO HIGH FOR ME.
04:53:31.513: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER GRAND. SORRY.
04:53:38.586: >> Councilmember Grand: INK THAT YOU. I JUST WANTED TO ALSO -- I WANTED TO THANK COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN AND PLANNING COMMISSION, WHEN READING THROUGH THE MINUTES THAT WERE IN OUR PACKET, I WAS IMPRESSED BY THE ITERATIVE DISCUSSION THAT HAPPENED, SO JUST AS WE THINK ABOUT POTENTIALLY MAKING CHANGES, I WOULD ENCOURAGE ANYONE TO GO BACK TO LOOK AT SOME OF THE CHANGES THAT WERE ALREADY MADE JUST TO GET A SENSE OF WHAT THEIR THINKING WAS HERE.
04:54:07.348: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN. ZACK THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR AND THANK YOU FOR THE FEEDBACK. IT WILL BE A MONTH, NOT JUST TWO WEEKS BECAUSE IT'S A ZONING AMENDMENT. SO YOU HAVE PLENTY OF TIME TO ASK QUESTIONS AND COPY ME INTO THAT. JUST QUICKLY RESPOND TO THE 60% A.M.I. BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S A GREAT POINT THAT CAME UP SEVERAL TIMES IN DISCUSSION. A FEW THINGS. ONE WAS WE GOT FEEDBACK FROM AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROPERTY MANAGERS THAT SAID, 30%, A.M.I. WAS MUCH MORE LIKELY TO COME WITH THE NEED OF SUPPORTIVE SERVICES, WHICH WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT TO ACTUALLY PROVIDE IN DOWNTOWN BUILDINGS LIKE THIS, WHERE IT'S MIXED INTO GENERAL UNITS THAT ARE MORE MARKET RATE AND MORE DIVERSE IN GENERAL. SO THAT WAS ONE CONSIDERATION. AND THEN THE OTHER WAS JUST THE -- IT'S STILL REALLY TOUGH FOR PEOPLE AT 60% A.M.I. TO FIND HOUSING IN THIS COMMUNITY, PARTICULARLY RIGHT IN NEAR THEIR JOB CENTERS. THAT'S PEOPLE WHO ARE HOSPITAL TECHNICIANS, ASSISTANTS TO PHYSICAL THERAPISTS NOT PHYSICAL THERAPISTS THEMSELVES LIKE OFFICE ADMINS. IT'S STILL A NEED AND IT WAS INTERESTING WHEN I WAS DOING SOME RESEARCH, A80% A.M.I., YOU COULD FIND THE AIRPORTS. IT WASN'T EASY BUT COULD YOU FIND THEM. AS SOON AS YOU DROPPED DOWN TO 60% A.M.I., I COULDN'T EVEN FIND APARTMENTS. SO IT'S FILLING A NEED THAT EXISTS.
04:55:36.738: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
04:55:39.774: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I THINK WHAT WE MIGHT HAVE HERE IS A SEMANTICS ISSUE, HOW TO ADDRESS THESE DIFFERENT TYPES OF HOUSING WE ARE TRYING TO SUPPORT AS A COMMUNITY, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW THIS MIGHT BE WHAT YOU CONSIDER, LIKE, WHAT WE MIGHT HAVE CALLED OUR WORKFORCE TYPE OF HOUSING. I HEARD THAT THE LANGUAGE AROUND ALL OF THESE THINGS HAS CHANGED TO RAPIDLY. I DON'T WANT TO SAY THE WRONG THING BUT I THINK IT'S SEMANTICS ISSUE. WHEN YOU DID THE RESEARCH AND WHEN YOU LOOK ONLINE, AND, YOU KNOW, I TALKED TO PEOPLE WHO ARE, YOU KNOW, WAITRESSES AND WHATEVER, THEY ARE MAKING FOR PARKING DOWNTOWN, BUT THEY CAN'T LIVE HERE AND THAT'S WHY THEY PAY FOR PARKING. I APPRECIATE THAT FEEDBACK. I CON FIND ALL THE PLANNING COMMISSIONS ON THE CTN SITE, BUT I WILL DIG THEM UP. THANKS.
04:56:28.156: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
04:56:29.090: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  YOU KNOW AS A -- THANK YOU. AS A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER HERE IN TOWN, I CAN JUST SAY THAT THE WAGES THAT PEOPLE EARN IN OUR INDUSTRY ARE NOT 30%. THEY ARE 60 TO 80%, AND, YOU KNOW, WE NEED TO BE ATTACKNG THIS CRISIS AT ALL LEVELS. WE NEED TO BE REALISTIC. CONSTRUCTION COSTS ARE NOT CHEAP. YOU ARE BUILDING DOWNTOWN, WHICH IS NOT CHEAP. AND THEN WE WANT IT AT 30% A.M.I. WHICH IS PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT SOME HUGE, FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SUBSIDY GRANTS AND SOME PHILANTHROPISTS, BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN IN A CAPITALISTIC MARKET SYSTEM. I DON'T WANT TO SET UP GOALS THAT ARE COMPLETELY UNATTAINABLE. I WOULD RATHER HAVE SOMETHING THAT IS ATTAINABLE THAT WILL ADDRESS THE ISSUE THAT MY EMPLOYEES FACE AND I WOULD BE HAPPY TO SEE 60 AND # 0% A.M.I., AND IT'S GOING TO RELIEVE THE PRESSURE ON THE OTHER PRICE POINTS AND THE OTHER PARTS OF THE SPECTRUM. SO I THINK BECOMING TOO AGGRESSIVE IS A RECIPE FOR FAILURE.
04:57:48.703: >> Mayor Taylor: I'M DELIGHTED THAT THIS IS GOING TO MOVE FORWARD. I HAVE THINK WE HAVE ALL HEARD FOLKS WHO NEED THIS HOUSING, AND FOLKS WHO SUPPORT AND NEED THIS HOUSING THAT WE WANT MORE AFFORDABLE UNITS IN THE DOWNTOWN, MORE AFFORDABLE UNITS THROUGHOUT ANN ARBOR. AND -- BUT THE DOWNTOWN HAS A -- YOU KNOW, A CONNECTION TO EVERYONE. EVERYONE FEELS LIKE THEY HAVE A DOWNTOWN, IT'S A COMMUNAL RESOURCE AND I'M GLAD THAT THIS IS MOVING FORWARD BECAUSE WE NEED MORE PEOPLE WHO -- TO BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT AND ACTUALLY LIVE AND ENJOY THAT RESOURCE. SO THIS IS, I THINK, A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND I'M GLAD THAT THE LAPPING COMMISSION HAS WORKED IT OUT SO CAREFULLY AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THE FURTHER CONSIDERATION. FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. C-3, AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND SECTION 1:239 OF CHAPTER 8 OF THE CODE OF CITY OF ANN ARBOR TO ADD A PUBLIC ART COMMISSION LIAISON AND DESIGN REVIEW BOARD. MOVED BY RAMLAWI AND SECONDED. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
04:59:03.311: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES, YES, THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS BROUGHT TO ME BY THE ANN ARBOR ARTS COMMISSION WHERE THEY FELT THAT IT COULD HELP WITH SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE ARE HAVING WITH THE BUILDINGS THAT GO UP IN -- IN AND AROUND OUR CITY. AND GIVE THE ARTS COMMISSION MORE PURPOSE, AND AGAIN, HELP WITH THE CONVERSATIONS EARLY ON WITH DEVELOPERS AND THE DESIGN REVIEW BOARD. SO WHAT THIS IS DOING IS ADDING A NONVOTING MEMBER TO THE DESIGN REVIEW BOARD TO BE IN THE CONVERSATIONS WITH DEVELOPERS EARLY ON. TO HAVE MAYBE A COSMIC COLLISION AND A CONVERSATION THAT WILL RESULT IN PUBLIC BENEFIT WHEN IT COMES TO ART AND THE WAY DEVELOPMENTS PROCEED. THERE WAS A LOT OF HESITATION EARLY ON THAT THIS WOULD GIVE MEMBERS OF THE ARTS COMMISSION FALSE HOPE AND INFLUENCE. AGAIN, IT'S A NONVOTING MEMBER. THEY ARE JUST THERE TO HELP FACILITATE A CONVERSATION AND MAYBE PRODUCE BUILDINGS THAT HAVE MORE AESTHETIC APPEAL TO THEM THAN SOME OF THE ONES THAT WE HAVE SEEN TO DATE. SO I CAN TAKE ANY QUESTIONS FROM STAFF. I'M PROUD TO BRING THIS FORTH AS SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN ASKED BY THE COMMISSION AND I THINK WOULD BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY.
05:00:40.107: >> Mayor Taylor: FOURTHFURTHER DISCUSSION?
05:00:43.911: >> Councilmember Hayner:  JUST A QUESTION. DOES IS OUR DESIGN REVIEW BOARD SORT OF A FORMALL DEAND NOT HAVE ANY POWER OF LAW? -- FORMALITY AND NOT HAVE ANY POWER OF LAW?
05:00:58.192: >> GOOD EVENING, STILL BRETT LENART. IT WAS DESIGNED NOT TO HAVE THE POWER OF LAW. IT WAS DESIGNED TO BE ADVISORY. SO ALL PROJECTS THAT ARE IN THE DOWNTOWN, THE D1 OR D2 THAT ARE NOT IN THE HISTORIC DISTRICT ARE DESIGNED TO COME TO THE REVIEW BOARD FOR REVIEW AND ADVICE FOR THE DESIGN GOODLINES BUT YOU ARE CORRECT IT'S NOT BINDING IN ANY WAY.
05:01:26.387: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YOU HEAR SOME COMMUNITIES WHERE IT IS AND I WONDER IF AT SOME POINT WHETHER YOU WEIGH THE OUTCOMES IN THOSE COMMUNITIES AND SEE IF THEY CHANGE THEIR ORDINANCE.
05:01:36.364: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
05:01:37.698: >> Councilmember Lumm: I APPRECIATE THIS BEING BROUGHT FORWARD AND I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE ME NAME ADDED AS A SPONSOR. I THINK THIS IS A GOOD IDEA FOR A BUNCH OF REASONS. AS A SAID ALL ALONG, I THINK FOCUSING PUBLIC ART EXCLUSIVELY ON THE CITY'S CAPITAL PROJECTS IS A FLAWED APPROACH. IT'S MUCH TOO NARROW OF A SCOPE. THIS BROADENS THAT SCOPE. THIS FOCUSES ON PRIVATELY FUNDED ART WORK AS PART OF DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, ON TAXPAYER FUNDED PUBLIC ART. I DO THINK THAT THE DESIGN REVIEW BOARD, EVEN THOUGH THEY DON'T HAVE THE FORCE OF LAW NECESSARILY, BUT I DO THINK IT'S AN APPROPRIATE PLACE FOR DISCUSSIONS ABOUT OPPORTUNITIES FOR PUBLIC ART INSTALLATIONS AND I AGREE THAT THE PUBLIC ART COMMISSION LIAISON SHOULD BE A NONVOTING MEMBER OF THE BOARD. SO THANKS.
05:02:25.946: >> Mayor Taylor: DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. DC-1 RESOLUTION DIRECTING REVIEW OF CITY TRANSPORTATION PLANNING AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STAFFING. MOVED BY GRISWOLD AND SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER. DISCUSSION, COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
05:02:48.269: >> Councilmember Griswold: IT'S VERY LATE AND I WILL BE BRIEF. IN THE BUDGET THIS YEAR, WE APPROVED A SENIOR ENGINEER. THAT POSITION HAS NOT BEEN FILLED YET. THIS RESOLUTION MOVES US IN THAT DIRECTION. I ALSO SUBMITTED TO JACKIE AN AMENDMENT TO THIS RESOLUTION A FEW HOURS AGO. DO YOU HAVE THAT, JACKIE? AND APOLOGIZE THAT STAFF HAD TO STAY HERE SO LATE. RESOLVE THAT THE CITY COUNCIL DIRECT THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR TO NEGOTIATE WITH SAM SCHWARTZ CONSULTING TO AMEND THE EXISTING CONTRACT TO INCLUDE AN AN ASSESSMENT OF OUR PEDESTRIAN AND CYCLING ENVIRONMENT BEFORE NOVEMBER 30th, 2019.
05:04:18.592: >> Mayor Taylor: SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
05:04:22.329: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I JUST HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THE FORM OF THAT AMENDMENT. IS -- IS MR. SCHWARTZ TO BE -- CONTRACT TO BE AMENDED PRIOR TO NOVEMBER 30th OR HIS ASSESSMENT TO BE COMPLETED BEFORE NOVEMBER 30th? I ASSUME IT'S THE PRIOR.
05:04:38.679: >> Councilmember Griswold: NO, IT'S THE ASSESSMENT. I SEE IT AS A TWO OR THREE DAY PROJECT AT MOST. AND HOWARD LAZARUS AND I DISCUSSED THIS TODAY, HOWEVER WE DID NOT DISCUSS THE DATE AND SO I AM FLEXIBLE THERE.
05:04:59.300: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THE DATE ACCEPTABLE TO STAFF. I DON'T SUPPOSE WE KNOW THE CONSULTANT'S AVAILABILITY. MR. HUPY, MR. LAZARUS?
05:05:18.185: >> CRAIG HUPY, PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIVE AREA. WE HAVEN'T DISCUSSED IT WITH THE CONSULTANT YET TO KNOW THE THEIR AVAILABILITY AND WE DON'T KNOW TO WHAT DEPTH THAT ASSESSMENT WOULD BE DONE. SO IT'S HARD TO SAY WHETHER IT'S NOVEMBER 30th OR THE END OF THE CALENDAR YEAR.
05:05:39.640: >> Mayor Taylor: THE END OF THE CALENDAR YEAR.
05:05:41.709: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WOULD CONSIDER THAT TO BE A FRIENDLY AMENDMENT.
05:05:45.379: >> Mayor Taylor: THE END OF THE CALENDAR YEAR? IS THAT ACCEPTABLE?
05:05:48.816: >> Councilmember Hayner:  WHEN IS THE REPORT DUE.
05:05:50.417: >> Mayor Taylor: BY THE END OF THE -- BY THE END OF THE CALENDAR YEAR.
05:05:54.054: >> Councilmember Hayner:  IT WAS PRIOR UNDER THE CONTRACT DUE THE END OF THE CALENDAR YEAR?
05:05:57.491: >> NO, THIS IS A NEW SCOPE WITHIN THE -- THE -- I SHOULDN'T SAY NEW SCOPE. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ROLLED INTO THE FULL FULL REPORT AT THE END OF THE PROJECT.
05:06:12.339: >> Mayor Taylor: AND WHAT I HEAR YOU SAYING IS DECEMBER 31 IS A REASONABLE EXPECTATION.
05:06:20.848: >> IF IT'S TRULY A TWO ARE THREE DAYEST AND THE CONSULTANT IS AVAILABLE, THEN WE WILL FIND THAT OUT WHEN WE NEGOTIATE.
05:06:30.824: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THAT A FRIENDLY AMENDMENT TO THE AMENDMENT.
05:06:33.360: >> Councilmember Griswold: THAT'S FRIENDLY. AND THE PURPOSE FOR DOING THIS IS SIMPLY TO LOOK AT OUR ENVIRONMENT, TO SEE IF THERE ARE SOME VERY SIMPLE LOW-COST OR NO-COST THINGS THAT WE COULD BE DOING THAT WOULD DRIVE DOWN OUR PEDESTRIAN CRASH RATE, AND I SEE THE FORMAT FOR THIS BEING THE SIX Es WHICH IS A PRETTY STANDARD FORMAT FOR NON-MOTORIZED TRANSPORTATION. YOU LOOK AT ENGINEERING, ENCOURAGEMENT, EDUCATION ENFORCEMENT, EDUCATION AND EQUITY. SO IT'S ALMOST LEEK A FILL-IN THE-THE-BOX.
05:07:12.900: >> Mayor Taylor: CAN I TAKE THIS AMENDMENT TO BE FRIENDLY?
05:07:14.902: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES.
05:07:16.070: >> Mayor Taylor: DOES ANYONE OBJECT TO THAT? [ OFF MICROPHONE COMMENT ]
05:07:20.975: >> Mayor Taylor: THE DEADLINE IS FRIENDLY. WE REFER TO THE DECEMBER 31 DEADLINE AND NOW THE QUESTION IS, IS THIS AMENDMENT FRIENDLY TO THE MOTION? NO ACTION. IT'S FRIENDLY TO THE MOTION. COUNCIL WOMAN GRISWOLD, YOU STILL HAVE THE FLOOR WITH RESPECT TO THE AMENDED RESOLUTION.
05:07:38.993: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE TO SAY GIVEN THE TIME.
05:07:42.730: >> Mayor Taylor: ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
05:07:46.834: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I JUST HAVE A QUESTION FOR OUR CITY ADMINISTRATOR. THERE'S THIS -- THIS HAS BEEN POSTPONED COMING FROM A PRIOR MEETING. WE'VE HAD DISCUSSIONS ABOUT HIRING A FULL-TIME EMPLOYEE TO HELP WITH OUR GOALS. FROM MY UNDERSTANDING THAT POSITION HAS NOT BEEN FILLED. I'M CONCERNED WITH THAT FACT. AND I'M WONDERING IF THERE IS ANY REASONS THAT WE'RE NOT AWARE OF, THAT -- NOT FILLING THAT POSITION FOR THAT. YOU KNOW, WE PASSED THE BUDGET. IT WENT INTO EFFECT IN JULY 1st AND WE ARE IN OCTOBER RIGHT NOW. SO JUST A LITTLE -- IF YOU WOULD LET US KNOW IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT'S KEEPING YOU FROM FILLING IT.
05:08:47.561: >> City Admin. Lazarus: I WILL THINK WE WANT TO BE DILIGENT. I THINK THERE WAS DIRECTION AND CONCERN ABOUT IT. THE PERSON HIRE HAVE SPECIFIC EXPERIENCE IN THE AREA OF VISION ZERO. WHAT STAFF HAS DONE IS REACHED OUT TO LEADING CITIES, THOSE THAT HAVE ADVANCED VISION ZERO PROGRAMS TO SEE WHAT THEIR JOB DESCRIPTIONS INCLUDE. AS WE CONCLUDE THAT, WE WILL POST THE AD AND TRY TO GET THE POSITION FILLED AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. BUT TO QUOTE MR. HAYNER, WE WANT TO MEASURE TWICE AND CUT ONCE.
05:09:27.201: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: I -- TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, I DON'T FIND THAT A SATISFACTORY RESPONSE. WE HAVE LIVES AT RISK DAILY, I -- I WOULD HAVE HOPED THAT THIS WOULD HAVE TAKEN A FASTER TRACK.
05:09:48.422: >> City Admin. Lazarus: WELL, I WOULD CALL YOUR ATTENTION TO --
05:09:50.357: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I'M SORRY. I WILL JUST FEEL THAT THIS -- WE SHOULD HAVE -- WE SHOULD BE MUCH CLOSER TO THAT HIRE.
05:09:59.233: >> City Admin. Lazarus: I WOULD CALL THE COUNCILMEMBER'S ATTENTION TO THE REPORTS WE SUBMIT MONTHLY ON THE AMOUNT OF IMPROVES ON PEDESTRIAN INFRASTRUCTURE.
05:10:08.909: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THOSE I APPRECIATE. THEY DO -- THEY SEEM ACCELERATED. WE ARE GETTING MUCH MORE WORK DONE. I APPRECIATE THAT, BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR HERE. WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOMEONE WOULD CAN HAVE A MORE COMPRENCIVE UNDERSTANDING OF ALL THE MOVING PARTS SO WE ARE NOT DEALING WITH HODGEPODGE.
05:10:33.734: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
05:10:38.872: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I THINK I JUST -- I JUST WANT A CLARIFICATION FROM WHAT -- OR FOR THE ANSWER THAT COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI JUST GOT. IT'S TAKEN -- IT'S TAKEN THIS MANY MONTHS TO COLLECT INFORMATION FROM -- FROM OTHER CITIES ABOUT HOW THE JOB SHOULD BE DESCRIBED? IS THAT WHAT I'M UNDERSTANDING? LIKE, WE DON'T YET HAVE A JOB DESCRIPTION TO EVEN POST?
05:11:05.065: >> City Admin. Lazarus: THAT'S WHAT I -- THAT'S CORRECT.
05:11:06.633: >> Councilmember Nelson: OKAY. THANK YOU.
05:11:10.537: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
05:11:13.907: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I DO SEE THIS RESOLUTION, THOUGH, AS A COMPROMISE AND I THINK THAT THIS POSITION IS SOMEONE WHO IS VERY SPECIALIZED AND BRINGING IN SOMEONE IN FRONT OF SAM SHULTZ DAYS FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS WILL COMPENSATE FOR THE FACT THAT WE DON'T HAVE ANYONE ON STAFF YET THAT HAS THIS EXPERTISE.
05:11:40.467: >> City Admin. Lazarus: SO WE HAD THAT CONVERSATION BEFORE ABOUT THE QUALIFICATION OF OUR STAFF, AND I WILL ACCEPT THE COMMENT WITHOUT NECESSARILY AGREEING WE HAVE A QUALIFIED STAFF. THE DIRECTION IS VERY CLEAR AND WE WILL COMPLY WITH IT.
05:11:59.019: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. DO WE HAVE AN ESTIMATE OF WHAT THE ADDITIONAL WORK IS BEING ASKED FOR FROM WHAT THE CONSULTANT -- IS THAT ALREADY PART OF WHAT WE PAID OR IS THIS AN ADDITIONAL FEE? AND WHAT WILL THAT FEE BE?
05:12:14.234: >> WE HAVEN'T HAD THAT DISCUSSION YET WITH THE CONSULTANT, SO I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE DOLLAR VALUE THAT THEY MAY ASSIGN TO THIS. A>> Councilmember Ramlawi: THAT AND WILL BE WHAT COMES BACK TO US BY THE END OF THE YEAR?
05:12:31.785: >> YES, IN FACT, IF WE -- WE HAVE A CONTINGENCY WITH THIS CONTRACT, I'M LOOKING AT STAFF. I CAN'T RECALL. IF WE HAVE A CONTINGENCY, WE CAN -- AND IT'S -- AS MUCH -- AS LITTLE WORKS AS DESCRIBED, WE CAN DO IT WITHIN THE CONTINGENCY. AS WE PAIRED THIS CONTRACT BACK, THAT'S WHY THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THE CONTINGENCY WAS LEFT IN IT OR NOT. IF THERE ISN'T A CONTINGENCY, WE WOULD HAVE TO COME BACK TO COUNCIL.
05:13:09.323: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES. AND I JUST -- I JUST AM TROUBLED BY THE LACK OF SPECIFICITY. WHAT IS THE ASSESSMENT. WHAT DEGREE ARE WE GOING INTO? I JUST -- I'M NOT -- I'M NOT GOING TO PIN MY -- I'M NOT GOING TO PIN HIGH HOPES ON THIS.
05:13:36.316: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. ROLL CALL VOTE WITH COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER OF THE MAIN MOTION.
05:13:44.992: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES.
05:13:47.861: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES.

05:14:01.008: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  NO.
05:14:02.576: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES. CLERK THE MOTION CARRIES.
05:14:09.182: >> Mayor Taylor: DC-2, RESOLUTION TO APPROVE CLOSING WILLIAM BETWEEN SOUTH 5th AND THOMPSON STREETS AND SOUTH DIVISION BETWEEN WILLIAM AND JEFFERSON STREETS FROM WILLIAM STREET BIKEWAY GRAND OPENING ON SUNDAY, OCTOBER 27th, 2019. DISCUSSION OF D CRITICAL DC-2. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
05:14:32.105: >> Councilmember Hayner:  IS THERE A CRITICAL MASS EVENT?
05:14:35.308: >> Mayor Taylor: IT'S I BIG OLD PARTY.
05:14:37.310: >> Councilmember Hayner:  ARE YOU CUTTING A RIBBON?
05:14:39.913: >> Mayor Taylor: WHAT GOOD AM. I IF I'M NOT CUTTING A RIBBON? , OH, OH, WE HAVE ANSWERS TO OUR QUESTIONS.
05:14:47.587: >> LAURA THOMPSON, THE COMMUNICATION DIRECTOR AT THE D.D.A. WE ARE PLANNING A GRAND OPEN CELEBRATION FOR THE WILLIAM STREET BIKEWAY. IT'S TO CELEBRATE THE FORT WORTH AND POTENTIALLY A NETWORK OF BIKE LANES SO WE ARE PARTNERING WITH A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS, WE ARE WORKING WITH WBWC, AND ACTUALLY THE ANN ARBOR POLICE AND THE ANN ARBOR FIRE DEPARTMENT, PEAK WHICH IS THE PROGRAMS AND EDUCATION FOR ALL CYCLISTS. SO THEY ARE ALL PART OF THIS EVENT. WE ARE RUNNING IT AS A BIKE RODEO. SO SAFETY IS WHAT WE ARE FOCUSING ON. WE WILL HAVE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT STATIONS ON WILLIAMS STREET AND BIKE HELMET FITTING AND WE ARE PROVIDING 100 FREE BIKE HELMETS. WE ARE WORKING WITH SAFE KIDS ON THAT OUT OF CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS. WE WILL HAVE A BIKE REPAIR STATION. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TURN BOX TRAINING BECAUSE WE WILL HAVE TURN BOXES ALONG WILLIAM STREET. THEY WILL BE THE FIRST IN ANN ARBOR SO WE FEEL LIKE IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO FOCUS ON THAT. SO WE ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO HAVE TURN BOX TRAINERS. IF YOU GO THROUGH TURN BOX TRAINING, YOU WILL GET A T-SHIRT. WE ARE WORKING WITH THE ANN ARBOR POLICE. THEY ARE GOING TO LEAD RIDES ALONG THE BIKE WAY. SO WE WILL HAVE AMBASSADOR-LED RIDES. SO WE ARE WORKING ON A WHOLE HOST OF DIFFERENT INITIATIVES TO GET PEOPLE INVOLVED AND EXCITED ABOUT THIS.
05:16:10.237: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU. I THINK ONE OF THE GREATEST THINGS THAT THE D.D.A. EVER DID WAS PROVIDE THOSE -- THE LIGHT KITS FOR THE BIKES. I SEE SO MANY OF THOSE ON KIDS BIKES IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD AND I WOULD --
05:16:26.353: >> Councilmember Lumm: IT'S THE CITY.
05:16:27.420: >> THE D.D.A. HAS DONE THAT AND GET DOWNTOWN HAS DONE IT IN THE PAST.
05:16:31.791: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I REALLY THINK THAT'S GREAT AND I WOULD LOVE TO PRY UP SOME MONEY. THAT'S REALLY A DIRECT IMPACT ON KID SAFETY YOU HAVE IN THOSE BIKE LANES.
05:16:40.534: >> YEAH. WE ARE ALSO PROVIDING BELLS, BIKE BELLS AT THE EVENT FROM WBWC ACTUALLY RECOMMENDED. THAT THAT HELPS WITH SAFETY WITH PEDESTRIANS AND BIKERS. SO --
05:16:58.018: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WOULD LIKE TO BE LISTED AS A COSPONSOR AND IT'S PART OF THE KIDS SAFE WIDE WORK AND OTHER SAFETY ACTIVITIES.
05:17:14.234: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I'M NOT THE BIGGEST FAN OF RIBBON CUTTING CEREMONIES. I DON'T GO TO TOO MANY I HAVE A -- I'M JUST A MISER AND I WANT TO KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY WE SPENT ON THIS PROMOTION FOR THIS REALLY SMALL STRETCH OF PROTECTED BIKE LANE. I FEEL LIKE WE SPENT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS PROMOTING OURSELVES, THAT COULD HAVE PERHAPS GONE INTO ACTUAL INFRASTRUCTURE FOR MORE SAFETY, RATHER THAN JUST PADDING OURSELVES ON THE BACK. I'M REALLY CONCERNED WITH THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT'S BEEN SPENT ON PROMOTION AND MARKETING, RATHER THAN DOING. SO REALLY CURIOUS TO SEE WHAT -- HOW MUCH MONEY HAS BEEN SPENT ON PROMOTING THIS. IT'S A VERY BIG CONCERN OF MINE. YOU KNOW, I WAS -- I WANT TO SEE SUBSTANCE -- AND FRANKLY, I APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT'S BEING DONE. I SEE A LOT OF MONEY BEING SPENT, THAT COULD BE SPENT FIXING THE UNSAFE CROSSWALKS IN OUR DOWNTOWN. THE TRIP HAZARDS THAT EXIST PRETTY MUCH EVERYWHERE. I'M JUST -- JUST ONE COUNCILMEMBER. I'M VERY CRITICAL OF THE MONEY BEING SPENT ON MARKETING.
05:18:39.252: >> AND JUST TO POINT OUT, OUR WHOLE CAMPAIGNS SURROUNDING IT BIKEWAY, FIRST WAS AWARENESS AND THE SECOND WAS EDUCATION. A LOT OF MONEY TOWARDS SPENDING IS EDUCATING THEM ON THE NEW ROAD.
05:18:57.937: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  DO WE HAVE ANY FIGURES OF HOW MUCH MONEY WE SPENT? PLEASE, CAN I GET THAT?
05:19:03.243: >> SURE.
05:19:05.045: >> Mayor Taylor: FOURTH DISCUSSION. -- FURTHER DISCUSSION. ROLL CALL VOTE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
05:19:13.920: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES.

05:19:31.104: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES.
05:19:32.839: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION
05:19:34.240: >> Mayor Taylor: DC-3:00 RESOLUT ION REGARDING ESTABLISHMENT OF A CITY OF ANN ARBOR MARIJUANA PERMITTING, OVERSIGHT AND REVIEW FUNCTION AND BODY. MOVED BY LUMM AND SECONDED BY RAMLAWI.
05:19:49.622: >> Councilmember Lumm: IN THE NEAR FUTURE, MARGIN WILL BE HOSTING A NUMBER OF MARIJUANA BUSINESSES. THE OVERGOING OVERSIGHT OF THESE ORDINANCES AND BUSINESSES. THE PREMISE UNDERLYING THE RESOLUTION IS THAT THE OVERSIGHT BODY TO SUPPLEMENT STAFF'S EFFORTS WILL HELP TO ENSURE A SAFE, EQUITABLE -- THE RESOLUTION IS NOT PRESCRIPTION IS IT DOES NOT ASSUME AN ANSWER IN TERMS OF THE AUTHORITY, THE STRUCTURE, AND SCOTT OF AN OVERSIGHT FUNCTION AND BODY WHAT THE RESOLUTION DOES DO IS TO INDICATE THAT COUNCIL ENDORSES CREATING AN OVERSIGHT BODY AND IT DIRECTS THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR TO PREPARE A REPORT FOR COUNCIL CONSIDERATION WITHIN 90 DAYS OUTLINING ALTERNATIVES AND RECOMMENDATIONS. MORE SPECIFICALLY, THE RESOLUTION OUTLINES THE EXPECTATIONS FOR THE REPORT, INCLUDING DISCUSSION, AND RECOMMENDATIONS ON AUTHORITY AND SCOPE, SUCH AS ALLOCATING PERMITS BOTH INITIALLY AND RENEWALS, ORDINANCE ENFORCEMENT AND OTHER POLICY CONSIDERATIONS AS WELL AS STRUCTURE AND MEMBERSHIP. PROPER OVERSIGHT OF MARIJUANA FACILITIES AND PERMITS IS SIMILAR IN MANY RESPECT TO OVERSIGHT OF THE LIQUOR LICENSES. WE HAVE A STANDING LIQUOR LICENSE REVIEW COMMITTEE, AND AT THE LAST MEETING, COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER AND I BELIEVE COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI SUGGESTED THE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THAT COMMITTEE COULD BE EXPANDED. THAT'S A VIABILITY POSSIBILITY BUT THIS RESOLUTION DOESN'T ASSUME THAT AND SPECIFICALLY REQUESTS RECOMMENDATIONS FROM STAFF REGARDING WHETHER THE LIQUOR LICENSE COMMITTEE SCOPE SHOULD BE EXPANDED TO INCLUDE THIS OR WHETHER THE CITY SHOULD CREATE A SEPARATE STANDALONE MARIJUANA REVIEW BOARD COMMISSION OR COMMITTEE. I AM NOT WEDDED TO 90 DAYS AND IF THE ADMINISTRATOR BELIEVES MORE OR LESS TIME IS NEEDED, THAT'S FINE BUT I DO BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO HAVE ESTABLISHED AN OVERSIGHT MECHANISM, SIMILAR TO LIQUOR LICENSES AND TO EXPICTURE EXPEDITIOUSLYHAVE THE DISCUSSIOS LIKE. IT'S NOT NEW NATIONALLY, BOULDER, A CITY MUCH LIKE US AND ONE WE OFTEN LOOK TO AS A BENCHMARK HAG LIVED WITH THIS FOR FIVE YEARS NOW AND WE CAN CERTAINLY LEARN FROM THEIR AND OTHER CITY'S EXPERIENCES. BOULDER HAS HAD A MARIJUANA ADVISORY PANEL SINCE'LL I2016, AND IS PRESENTLY LOOKING AT CREATING A MARIJUANA LICENSING AUTHORITY. I'M NOT SUGGESTING WE NEED TO COPY BOULDER BUT WE CAN CERTAINLY LEARN FROM THEIR EXPERIENCES. THE MOST OBVIOUS ROLE OF AN OVERSIGHT BODY IS ALLOCATING INITIAL PERMITS AND RENEWALS. THAT'S THE CASE WITH LIQUOR LICENSES BUT IT'S MORE THAN, THAT BEYOND JUST THE PERMITS BECAUSE RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA IS NEW, I THINK THE IMPOLITICALMENTATION OF OUR ORDINANCES AND THE SUCCESSFUL INTRODUCTION OF RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA IN ANN ARBOR WILL REQUIRE OVERSIGHT AND ENGAGEMENT ON A VARIETY OF OPERATIONAL ENFORCEMENT AND POLICY CONSIDERATIONS. ANYWAY, I HOPE YOU ALL WILL AGREE AND SUPPORT THIS TONIGHT AS I SAID UP FRONT, THIS DOESN'T PRESUME AN ANSWER BUT BEGINS THE DIALOGUE. AN IMPORTANT DIALOGUE AND WHAT THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL AND NATURE OF OVERSIGHT OF RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA NEEDS TO BE IN ANN ARBOR. THANK YOU FOR LISTENING AND FOR CONSIDERING THIS RESOLUTION.
05:22:55.008: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACREMAN. ZACK I LIKE THAT IT OPENS UP TO LOOK FOR BEST PRACTICES AND DIFFERENT ALTERNATIVES. I WOULD LOVE TO BE ADDED AS A COSPONSOR.
05:23:06.753: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
05:23:07.720: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER LUMM FOR BRINGING THIS FORTH AND LISTENING TO YOUR COLLEAGUES. I DO BELIEVE THAT THERE'S A LOT OF BANDWIDTH ON THAT LIQUOR LICENSE REVIEW COMMITTEE, AND AS YOU KNOW, MUCH OF THAT WORK IS DONE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR COME SUMMER TIME. THERE'S REALLY NOT MUCH GOING ON WITH THAT COMMITTEE. I HESITATE TO FORM A SEPARATE ONE. THERE ARE NUMEROUS ASSIGNMENTS, COUNCILMEMBERS ALREADY HAVE. I'M ON NEARLY 10 DIFFERENT ASSIGNMENTS AND, YOU KNOW, NOT TO SAY THAT OVERWORKED BUT YOU HAVE SOME SERIOUS SCHEDULING CONFLICTS. SO I BELIEVE THAT THAT WOULD BE MY POSITION, IS TO HARNESS WHAT WE ALREADY HAVE BROADEN IT AND THIS IS A VERY RESPONSIBLE -- RESPONSIVE MEASURE TO TAKE CONSIDERING WE JUST PASSED THE ORDINANCE THAT ALLOWS FOR RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA. IT'S ONLY NATURAL THAT WE FORM THIS AND MAKE SURE THAT WE, YOU KNOW, DO OUR FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITIES AND THIS IS A VERY, AGAIN, REASONABLE RESPONSIBLE AND I APPRECIATE IT AND THAT'S WHY I ASKED TO BE A COSPONSOR. THANK YOU.
05:24:42.315: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER EATON AND GRAND AND THEN WE CAN CALL IT A DAY. COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
05:24:46.519: >> Councilmember Eaton: I JUST WANT TO THANK COUNCILMEMBER LUMM FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND ASK THAT MY NAME BE ADDED AS A COSPONSOR.
05:24:52.291: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
05:24:53.159: >> Councilmember Grand: AFTER GETTING OVER THE SHOCK OF COUNCILMEMBER LUMM WANTING TO EMULATE BOULDER ON ANYTHING, I -- IT'S A COMPLIMENT. I THINK IS TERRIFIC. AND I THINK THIS WILL ALSO HELP ADDRESS SOME OF OUR CONCERNS ABOUT HOW WE, YOU KNOW -- HOW WE MANAGE TO MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS GOING FORWARD TO HAVE THIS TYPE OF GROUP TO HAVE -- TO HAVE SOME EXPERTS AND PEOPLE WHO REALLY, YOU KNOW, ARE PAYING ATTENTION TO HOW THIS IS BEING IMPLEMENTED SO THAT WE CAN MAKE SOME INFORMED DECISIONS IT WE NEED TO MAKE SOME TWEAKING. AND I WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A COSPONSOR AS WELL.
05:25:32.598: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION.
05:25:39.739: >> Councilmember Lumm: I CAN'T RESIST. YOU WANT TO REVISIT SOME OF THOSE AMENDMENTS, THEY ARE BOWELLER-LIKE.
05:25:44.444: >> Mayor Taylor: ALL IN FAVOR. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED?
05:25:47.080: >> Councilmember Bannister:  I WAS OVER HERE. IS IT POSSIBLE -- WE WERE OVER HERE WANTING TO BE COSPONSORS IF IT IT'S STILL POSSIBLE.
05:25:54.153: >> Councilmember Hayner:  WE DIDN'T WANT TO PILE ON.
05:25:57.390: >> Mayor Taylor: COME ON ABOARD. THE LIQUOR LICENSE REVIEW BOARD IS PRETTY AWESOME AND I THINK THIS WILL BE BENEFICIAL TO THE COMMUNITY AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THE ADMINISTRATOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS.
05:26:08.668: >> Mayor Taylor: ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. DC-4 RESOLUTION SUPPORTING THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY'S ACTIVE INVOLVEMENT WITH THE GELMAN SITE, ENCOURAGING ITS LISTING OF THE SAME AS A SUPERFUND SITE. MOVED BY GRISWOLD AND SECONDED BY BANISTER. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
05:26:27.954: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU. WITH MY COSPONSORS DEFERENCE, I -- I'M GOING TO MOVE TO POSTPONE THIS UNTIL PERHAPS THE FINAL MEETING OF THE YEAR. THIS WAS PLACED ON THE AGENDA BECAUSE WE HAD MADE A PROMISE TO OUR CONSTITUENTS AND OTHERS IN THE COMMUNITY, THAT WE WERE GOING TO ACT ON THIS ISSUE. AND WE HAD SOME -- WE HAVE HAD SOME ISSUES. WE HAD A COUPLE OF COMMUNITY MEETINGS ON IT AND A COUPLE OF GENT WORKING SESSIONS THAT HAVE BEEN VERY PRODUCTIVE AND THINGS ARE HAPPENING. SO IN DEFERENCE TO THAT, THE WORKING SESSION WITH OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS I WOULD LIKE TO SET THIS ASIDE TO THE MEETING IN DECEMBER. ONE THE REASONS THAT I USUALLY REPORT FROM OUR CARD MEETINGS, WHAT HAPPENED BUT THE WAY THE MONTH FELL, THIS TIME, OUR CARD MEETING WAS PRIOR TO -- IT WAS ON THE MONDAY -- OR THE TUESDAY, THE 1st AND SO WHAT HAPPENED AT THIS CARD MEETING IN A NUTSHELL IS ONCE AGAIN WE WERE GIVEN AN EXAMPLE OF HOW WE HAVE LEGITIMATE CONCERNS ABOUT EGLE/DEQ'S ABILITY TO OVERSEE PROPERLY THIS SITE AND INCLUDE ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS AND THE STAKEHOLDER'S CONCERNS IN THIS OVERSIGHT. SO THEY ALLOWED THE POLLUTER TO ABANDON THREE WELLS, ONE OF WHICH -- THREE MONITORING WELLS AND A CLUSTER OF FIVE WELLS, A PROPERTY CLUSTER OF FIVE WELLS AND THESE THREE WELLS ONE OF WHICH WAS A COMPLIANCE WELL UNDER THE TERMS OF CON SENT JUDGMENT. AND SO THE IDEA THAT DEQ WITHOUT SEEKING ANY OTHER COMMUNITY INPUT FROM ANY OF THE INTERVENING PARTNERS WOULD ALLOW THESE WELLS, COMPLIANCE WELL, IS BEYOND THE VEIL TO ME. AT SOME POINT THIS DECISION WILL COME BEFORE US, AND HOPEFULLY THAT POINT WILL BE SOON, BECAUSE MONTH AFTER MONTH, WE GET A REPORT THAT THE BEST PROTECTIONS ARE NOT IN PLACE.
05:28:32.144: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE I A SECOND ON THE --
05:28:34.080: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I APOLOGIZE FOR GOING ON ABOUT THAT WITHOUT AIL SECOND.
05:28:38.184: >> Mayor Taylor: THAT'S ALL RIGHT. IS THERE AIL SECOND ON THE POSTPONEMENT.
05:28:41.454: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WOULD LIKE TO CORRECT IT. I WILL SECOND IT FIRST.
05:28:48.094: >> Councilmember Hayner:  OH, DATE YOU MEAN.
05:28:51.564: >> Councilmember Griswold:  AN AMENDMENT OF JANUARY 7th, 2020 WHICH IS WHAT HAS BEEN REPLEDDED BY THE LEGAL STAFF.
05:29:01.741: >> Councilmember Hayner:  OH, OKAY.
05:29:02.708: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THAT FRIENDLY TO THE BODY? COUNCILMEMBER GRIZ WALD, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
05:29:08.781: >> Councilmember Griswold:  IT DRESSES ME TO MOVE THIS ON TO 2020, BUT WE NEED TO CONTINUE WITH THE PATH THAT WE HAVE TAKEN WITH OUR LAWYERS AND I BELIEVE THAT HAVING THIS AT A DATE CERTAIN IN JANUARY ALLOWS US TO NEGOTIATE FROM A POSITION OF POWER AND REALIZE THAT WE ARE NOT NEGOTIATING WITH GELMAN. WE ARE NEGOTIATING WITH DAN AHER, A MULTIBILLION DOLLARS COMPANY. I ALSO WANT TO PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR OTHER COSPONSORS.
05:29:41.914: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE POSTPONEMENT. FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE POSTPONEMENT?
05:29:48.087: >> Councilmember Eaton: I'M GOING TO VOTE IN FAVOR OF THE POSTPONEMENT. I ALSO WANT TO BE ADDED AS A COSPONSOR.
05:29:54.327: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR OF THE BOTH PONEMENT. [CHORUS OF AYES] IT IS POSTPONED. DC-5, DISCUSSION OF DC-5. THAT WAS ADDED WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE AGENDA. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
05:30:22.621: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES, I APPRECIATE LEGAL'S ADVICE IN HELPING TO PUT THIS TOGETHER AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT WE CAN CHOOSE TO DO THIS IN ONE MEETING IF IT MEETS A VOTE THRESHOLD. SO I -- DID EVERYBODY SEE A COPY OF THE RESOLUTION? IT'S ESSENTIALLY TO APPOINT A REPRAREPLACEMENT FOR THE CENTERF THE CITY TASK FORCE, AND SO THAT'S WHERE IT IS. SO WHEN COUNCILWOMAN GRAND AND I CAME UP WITH THE LIST OF FOLKS, WE HAD SORT OF AN ALTERNATIVE LIST, IN CASE IT WAS NECESSARY, AND I BASICALLY PULLED SOMEBODY FROM THAT ALTER ALTERNATIVE LISD BROUGHT IT FORWARD AND APOLOGIZE TO COUNCILWOMAN GRAND FOR NOT REACHING OUT TO HER EARLIER IN THE PROCESS ABOUT THAT. AND SO TYPICALLY THIS WOULD COME UP FROM A SORT OF COSPONSORSHIP SITUATION BUT I JUST ASKED -- I ASKED STAFF TO PUT THIS ON THE AGENDA FOR ME. SO I APPRECIATE THAT WE GOT IT ON THERE AND THE PERSON THAT I BROUGHT FORWARD, JOHN HAINES, REPRESENTS A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY THAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR THESE TYPES OF FOLKS. HE'S A NEAR NEIGHBOR, AND THE NEIGHBOR OUTREACH HAS BEEN GOING REALLY GREAT WITH THE OUTREACH SUBCOMMITTEE AND HE ALSO HAS MANY DECADES OF EXPERIENCE IN FUND-RAISING WHICH WAS IDENTIFIED AS AN ISSUE AROUND THIS SITE. AND SO WE ARE HOPING THAT HE CAN BRING SOME OF THAT VALUABLE EXPERIENCE TO THE GROUP AND SOME OF THE GROUP'S PARTNERS AND, YOU KNOW, BE A SUITABLE REPLACEMENT.
05:31:47.406: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
05:31:48.274: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, MAYOR TAYLOR AND THANK YOU, UP COULD SILL MEMBERR FOR ACTING ON THIS FOR THE REASONS STATED IN YOUR RESOLUTION. I ASKED TO BE A COSPONSOR OF THIS. I KNOW JOHN FAIRLY WELL. HE'S LIVED NEXT DOOR TO MY BUSINESS AND I STRONGLY BELIEVE WILL BE AN ASSET TO THIS TASK FORCE. HE'S VERY LEVEL HEADED. I DON'T THINK HE'S HIGHLY OPINIONIATED. HE'S FAIR AND BALANCED AND REASONABLE. HE CAN ENGAGE IN CONVERSATIONS IN WAYS I DON'T SEE VERY MANY PEOPLE DOING AND YOU ARE CORRECT IN HIS BACKGROUND AND HIS EXPERIENCE. HE'S DONE A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS AND I THINK IT WOULD BE A GREAT FIT, CONSIDERING WE LOST A WARD 5 PERSON WHO HAD TO STEP DOWN. HE HELPS TO REPLACE THAT -- THE RESIDENTIAL CREDENTIALS ARE THE SAME AND -- AND I CAN SPEAK HIGHLY OF HIS CHARACTER AND I URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO SUPPORT THIS APPOINTMENT.
05:32:57.810: >> Mayor Taylor: FOURTHFURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER.
05:33:04.550: >> Councilmember Grand: I ASK THAT MY NAME BE ADDED. I RECOGNIZE THAT THE PROCESS IS FLAWED BUT THERE ARE GREAT SEASONS FOR HAVING THIS PERSON ON THE TASK FORCE AND ONE OF THEM BEING THAT HE REACHED TO US. I THINK HIS ENTHUSIASM WILL SERVE THE TASK FORCE WELL.
05:33:22.535: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? ITIT IS APPROVED. DS-1. -- BY WAY THE CLARITY THIS POPS BACK TO DC-4, WE VIEW THIS AS A SCRIVENER'S ERROR. I UNDERSTAND THE FIRST MEETING IN JANUARY IS THE 6th, NOT THE 7th.
05:33:50.296: >> Councilmember Griswold: OH, OKAY.
05:33:57.436: >> Councilmember Nelson:  WE HAVE TO OPEN THE WHOLE THING AGAIN.
05:34:00.940: >> Mayor Taylor: GET THOSE PEOPLE IN THERE. DS LIVE 1, RESOLUTION AUTHORIZING SUMMARY PUBLICATION OF ORDINANCE NO 19-31, AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND SECTIONS 5.15, 5.16, 5.19 AND 5.37 OF CHAPTER 55 UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE OF TITLE V OF THE CODE OF CITY OF ANN ARBOR TO PIECIFY REGULATIONS OF USED ESTABLISHED BY THE MICHIGAN REGULATION AND TAXATION OF MARIJUANA ACT.
