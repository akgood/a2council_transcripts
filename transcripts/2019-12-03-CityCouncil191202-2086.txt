00:02:56.497: >> Mayor Taylor: AT THE PODIUM. IF WE COULD HAVE MICHAEL POCCIMELLI AND THE INDOMITABLE JENNIFER HALL.
00:03:06.974: >> GOOD EVENING. MY NAME IS MIKE POCCIMELLI AND I'M THE FIELD OFFICE DIRECTOR OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT MICHIGAN STATE OFFICE AND I WANT TO THANK YOU MAYOR TAYLOR, CITY ADMINISTRATOR LAZARUS, HOUSING COMMISSION DIRECTOR JENNIFER HALL AND THE ANN ARBOR CITY COUNCIL TO ALLOW ME TO ADDRESS EVERYBODY HERE THIS EVENING. I'M PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE THAT THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT WILL PROVIDE $3 MILLION FOR 384 NON-ELDERLY PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES ACROSS THE STATE OF MICHIGAN. THIS INCLUDES MORE THAN $822,000 AWARDED TO THE ANN ARBOR HOUSING COMMISSION TO SERVE 90 INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES AND I WILL NOTE THAT THE ANN ARBOR WARD IS THE LARGEST IN THE STATE. SECRETARY CARSON CAME TO DETROIT LAST WEEK, WHERE HE ANNOUNCED FIRST OF THESE MAINSTREAM HOUSING GRANTS. THEY ARE PART OF 325 AWARDS ISSUED TO LOCAL PUBLIC HOUSING AUTHORITIES AND KEY PARTNERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY, RECEIVING A TOTAL OF $131.3 MILLION, TO PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO MORE THAN 15,000 ADDITIONAL NON-ELDERLY PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES. THESE VOUCHERS WILL FURTHER THE AMERICAN WITH DISABILITIES ACT BY HELPING PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES LIVE IN THE MOST INTEGRATED SETTINGS POSSIBLE. H.U.D. IS EXCITED ABOUT WHAT THIS MEANS FOR EACH NEW INDIVIDUAL THAT WILL RECEIVE THESE NEW HOUSING ASSISTANCE VOUCHERS. THIS FUNDING PROVIDES A VITAL AFFORDABLE HOUSING OPTIONS FOR MOST VULNERABLE AMONG US. INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES ACROSS THE STATE OF MICHIGAN. FUNDING IS PROVIDED THROUGH THE MAINSTREAM HOUSING PROGRAM WHICH ISSUISSUES FUNDING TO ASSIST SUH VULNERABLE POPULATIONS THIS PROVIDES TARGETED ASSISTANCE TO THOSE WHO ARE TRANSITIONING OUT OF NURSING FACILITIES OR OTHER SEPARATED SETTINGS AT SERIOUS RISK OF GOING INTO NURSING FACILITIES IN SIMILAR SETTINGS. CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS, PREVIOUSLY EXPERIENCED HOMELESSNESS AND CURRENTLY IN SUPPORT OF HOUSING OR AT RISK OF BECOMING HOMELESS. HOUSING AUTHORITIES SUCH AS ANN ARBOR WHO RECEIVE THIS FUNDING AGREE TO FIND COMMUNITY PARTNERS WHO WILL PROVIDE VOLUNTARY SUPPORTIVE SERVICES TO HELP RECIPIENTS BECOME SELF-SUFFICIENT AND LIVE INDEPENDENTLY IN THEIR COMMUNITIES.

EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM HAS A VITAL ROLE TO PLAY IN THIS ENDEAVOR. THEY WANT TO HELP ALL AMERICANS HAVE THE BEST OPPORTUNITY I BELIEVE TO HELP PEOPLE REACH THEIR HIGHEST POTENTIAL. TO THIS END, THE MAINSTREAM VOUCHER FUNDING WE ARE ANNOUNCING TODAY COMPLIMENTS THE IMPORTANT WORK THAT H.U.D. DID TO SUPPORT THOSE WITH DISABILITIES THAT IT COULD NOT DO WITHOUT THE PARTNERSHIP OF ANN ARBOR HOUSING. THE FULL 60% OF THE FAIR HOUSING COMPLAINTS THAT H.U.D. PROCESSES CONCERNS DISABILITIES OF VARIOUS KINDS. WITH ALL INITIATIVES CENTRAL TO H.U.D.'S MISSION, OUR WORK IN THIS AREA IS UNFORTUNATELY NEVER OVER. OUR TEAM BEGINS EACH DAY WITH WILL I WILL HAVENS APWE HAD YESTERDAY AND WE WILL NEVER WAIVER IN THE VIGILANCE TO TOMORROW. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE YOU HERE IN ANN ARBOR, AND I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO FIGHT FOR OUR BRIGHTER FUTURE TOGETHER. WITH THAT, I WILL TURN IT OVER TO EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR JENNIFER HALL. [ APPLAUSE ]
00:06:50.231: >> THANK YOU. I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S A GOOD THING OR A BAD THING, BUT MY NAME, PHONE NUMBER, AND EMAIL IS LISTED ON H.U.D.'S WEBSITE AS A CONTACT. SO I GET CONTACTED BY HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE EVERY YEAR WHO ARE IN DESPERATE NEED OF HOUSING ASSISTANCE. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THEM EITHER HAVE A FAMILY MEMBER OR THEMSELVES HAVE A DISABILITY. SO WE ARE VERY HAPPY TO BE ABLE TO RECEIVE THESE ADDITIONAL VOUCHERS. IT'S A HUGE NEED IN OUR COMMUNITY. YOU WOULD LIKE TO ASK SERENA, ONE OF THE VOUCHER RECIPIENTS FROM THE PREVIOUS ROUND THAT WE AWARDED, TO PLEASE TALK ABOUT HER EXPERIENCE.
00:07:31.939: >> GOOD EVENING AND HAPPY HOLIDAYS TO YOU. WHEN I RECEIVED A CALL FROM LISA, COULD I SPEAK, WOULD I SPEAK, I -- PUBLIC SPEAKING IS NOT MY FORTE, BUT BECAUSE OF THE GREAT HELP I RECEIVED -- I WAS HOMELESS. I HAVE -- ON MY PROBLEM LIST, I GO TO U OF M, AND HERE IS MY PROBLEM LIST. THIS IS MY PROBLEM LIST. ALSO, I HAVE -- CURRENTLY I WAS TOLD BY DR. CASHLAND, THE NEUROSURGEON THAT THEY WANT TO DO SURGERY. THEY DISCOVERED HERE I HAVE -- THEY SAY IT'S A HEMAGIOMA, BUT IT'S COVERING THE VERTEBRAE AND HIS BRIT'S BROKEN MY VERTEBRAE. I'M SO HAPPY THAT WITH ALL OF THESE THINGS THAT I HAVE GOING ON WITH ME, THAT ONE THING I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IS MY RENT. BECAUSE I'M ON A FIXED INCOME AND IF I HAD TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT MY REPRESENT IT'S LIKE WHAT AM I GOING TO DO WITH ALL OF THESE THINGS GOING ON WITH ME? WITH ALL OF THESE ISSUES -- I MEAN, I'M STANDING HERE AND I KNOW YOU ARE LOOKING LIKE, WHAT? YES, I HAVE CHRONIC BACK PAIN. I HAVE -- I'M ALSO IN P.T. FOR MY NECK AT THE EISENHOWER -- OVER OFF EISENHOWER, THE BURLINGTON CENTER. I AM -- I GO THERE FOR THERAPY FOR MY NECK. BUT IF IT WASN'T FOR THIS PROGRAM, THAT I'M UNDER RIGHT NOW, I DON'T KNOW WHERE I WOULD BE RIGHT NOW. BECAUSE NOW I CAN GO TO MY HOME. I CAN REST. I CAN FOCUS ON HEALING. I CAN FOCUS ON -- SURGERY IS INEVITABLE. WE HAVE TO DO SURGERY. I'M TRYING TO HOLD OUT UNTIL AFTER THE HOLIDAYS, AND THAT'S A REAL CHALLENGE. BECAUSE EVERY DAY, EVEN RIGHT NOW, I'M IN PAIN. THEY HAVE ME ON GABOPENTIN, AND MOLOXACAM, BUT -- AND I ALSO HAVE DELOXATINE, BUT I'M CURRENTLY WITH DR. COIN OUT OF THE SPINE CLINIC. HE TOLD ME TO TRY THE GABOPENTIN TO STAY ON THAT. IF IT WASN'T FOR THIS PROGRAM, IF IT WAS NOT FOR THIS PROGRAM, I DON'T KNOW WHERE I WOULD BE RIGHT NOW. [ APPLAUSE ]
00:10:37.291: >> THANK YOU.
00:10:42.863: >> I HAVE MANY PARTNERS HERE. WE HAVE BOARD MEMBERS, STAFF WOULD HAVE WORKED ON THIS PROGRAM, AND A LOT OF COMMUNITY PARTNERS WHO HELP US WITH THIS PROGRAM THAT I WOULD LIKE TO ASK TO COME UP HERE FOR US TO RECEIVE OUR BIG FAT CHECK FROM H.U.D. [ OFF MICROPHONE COMMENTS ] [ APPLAUSE ]
00:12:04.645: >> CONGRATULATIONS ONCE AGAIN. [ APPLAUSE ]
00:12:14.021: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU, EVERYBODY, FOR COMING THIS IS TOTALLY EXCELLENT. THANK YOU. WE NOW COME TO PUBLIC COMMENTARY RESERVE TIME. IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO SPEAK TO COUNCIL AND THE COMMUNITY ABOUT MATTERS OF MUNICIPAL INTEREST. TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT RESERVE TIME, ONE NEEDS TO HAVE SIGNED UP IN ADVANCE BY CONTACTING OUR CITY CLERK. SPEAKERS HAVE THREE MINUTES IN WHICH TO SPEAK. SO PLEASE PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE TIME CLOCK. AS A MATTER OF THE COURTESY, WE MAY HAVE ONLY ONE PERSON SPEAKING AT A TIME AND FINALLY IF YOU REQUIRE ASSISTANCE IN SPEAKING BEFORE COUNCIL TODAY, WE WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO PROVIDE IT TO YOU. OUR FIRST SPEAKER TODAY IS TOM McMURTRIE. [ APPLAUSE ]
00:12:57.331: >> THANK YOU. I WORKED FOR OVER 20 YEARS AS THE CITY'S RECYCLING AND SOLID WASTE COORDINATOR. WHILE I HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF RESPECT FOR THE CURRENT CITY STAFF, I TAKE STRONG EXCEPTION TO THE RECOMMENDATION FOR THE CITY MRF, I THINK THE PROPOSAL TO ROE OPEN THE CITY MRT IS THE BEST PROPOSAL. I DISAGREE WITH THEM ON THE FOLLOWING POINTS. ONE, THE PROPOSED WORK PLANT. R. A.A.'S PROPOSAL INCLUDES SOME OF THE EXISTING MRT EQUIPMENT, BEYOND WHAT TV HAD ALLOWED. THIS WILL BE DONE BY A COMPANY THAT HAS A LONG TRACK RECORD OF DOING SUCH WORK. THEY WILL GUARANTEE THE WORK. STAFF PENALIZED R.A.A. FOR THIS WORK MAP. I BELIEVE THAT R.A.A.'S PROPOSAL SHOULD NOT BE PENALIZED FOR THIS. IT PROVIDES THE CITY AYER BY MAKING USE OF A PARTS OF AN ASSET THAT STILL HAVE USEFUL LIFE. TWO, TRANSLOADING OPERATIONS. STAFF HAS CONCERNS ABOUT R.A.A.'S ABILITY TO MAINTAIN SAFE TRANSLOADING OPERATIONS WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY REESTABLISHING FULL MRF OPERATIONS. R.A.A. WILL HAVE NO PROBLEM COMPLETING THIS. THE TRANSLOADING OPERATIONS AND THE MRF OPERATIONS UNDER TWO SEPARATE PARTS OF THE BUILDING. THREE, STAFF CLAIMS THAT R.A.A. FAILED TO MOTE PERFORMANCE MEASURES 75% OF THE TIME UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT. THE STANDARDS INCLUDED CLEANING ALL THE RECYCLABLES FROM THE FACILITY AT THE END OF EACH DAY. I HAVE NEVER BEEN TO A MRF WHERE THIS IS REQUIRED. THESE NEW STANDARDS THAT THE CITY SET UP ON THE CURRENT CONTRACT WERE DESIGNED TO SET R.A.A. FOR FAILURE. FOUR, STAFF CLAIMS THAT R.A.A. HAS NO DIRECT EXPERIENCE IN MRF OPERATIONS AND COMMODITY MARKETING. R.A.A.'S CURRENT DIRECTOR RYAN UCANNA HAS SET UP AND RUN FOUR DIFFERENT MRFs. THEY OPERATE BOTH A DROPOFF STATION AND A RECYCLING MRF WITH TONNAGES GREATER THAN THE PROPOSED CITY MRF, THERE ARE PLENTY OF EXAMPLES OF ENTITIES THAT PRATT ONLY ONE MRF AND DO IT WELL. FIVE, FEE PROPOSAL. CITY STAFF SCORED EMTERRA'S SCORE PROPOSAL SLIGHTLY LESS THAN R.A.A. THE COST DIFFERENCE, ONCE IT REACHED $45 PER TON WILL BE $40,000. THE COST DIFFERENCE AT TODAY'S MARKET PRICES IS OVER $400,000. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT R.A.A. SHOULD GET MORE CREDIT ON THEIR FEE PROPOSAL. IN ADDITION TO THE ABOVE POINTS I BELIEVE THAT OF THE RFP LEFT OUT SOME SIGNIFICANT ISSUES THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED. THE CLIMATE IMPACT, THE IMPROVED RECYCLING RATES, LOCAL JOBS TORQUE ADDITIONAL JOBS CREATED, EDUCATION AT THE MRF THERE WAS AN EDUCATION CENTER AND IT COULD BE REESTABLISHED AND FIVE, REGIONAL COOPERATION. IN SUMMARY, I THINK THIS SHOULD BE AN EASY DECISION. PLEASE SUPPORT ALTERNATIVE CA-7. THANK YOU.
00:16:00.514: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS JANE WRIGHT. JANE WRIGHT?
00:16:12.592: >> MY NAME IS ACTUALLY JAN WRIGHT. CLOSE, THOUGH. I'M SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE INTERFAITH COUNCIL FOR PEACE AND JUSTICE WHERE I CHAIR THE CAUCUS ON CONSUMPTION, WASTE AND THE CLIMATE CRISIS. AND I WANT TO SHARE SOME THOUGHTS WITH YOU TONIGHT ABOUT WHY REDEVELOPMENT OF THE ANN ARBOR MRF IS VERY IMPORTANT AS PART OF ANN ARBOR'S PLAN TO ADDRESS THE CLIMATE EMERGENCY. THERE ARE LOTS OF REASON, I WON'T HAVE TIME FOR VERY MANY OF THEM. LET ME SAY A COUPLE. ONE IS SOMETHING THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE. HIGH QUALITY, HIGH RECOVERABLE RECYCLING PROGRAMS ARE ONE OF THE MOST IMPACTFUL THINGS A LOCAL GOVERNMENT CAN DO TO ADDRESS THE CLIMATE CRISIS, ALTHOUGH THERE ARE MANY THINGS THAT CAN AND SHOULD BE DONE. BY DOUBLING OUR RECYCLING RATES, WHICH I HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO BELIEVE IS A LOW RECOVERY RATE IN THE COMMERCIAL AND THE MULTIFAMILY SECTORS, WE WOULD HAVE A CARBON IMPACT EQUIVALENT TO TAKING MORE THAN 5,000 CARS OFF THE ROAD, WHICH IS NO MEAN FEAT. PEOPLE TEND TO OVERLOOK THE ENERGY AND THE EMISSIONS WHEN THINGS ARE MANUFACTURING OUT OF SO-CALLED SCRAP MATERIALS, RATHER THAN VIRGIN MATERIALS. IT'S ALSO OBVIOUS THAT THE TRUCKING ALL OVER OUR RECYCLING TO LANSING, ESPECIALLY IN THE FORM THAT WILL END UP WITH LOWER QUALITY OUTPUT WILL CREATE A LOT OF GREENHOUSE GASES. IF THE MRF IS REDEVELOPED THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE WE WILL SAVE NOT ONLY MOST OF THESE TRIP TO LANSING EMIG EMISSIONS BUT EMISSIONS WHEN NEIGHBORING COMMUNITIES TRANSPORT THEIR RECYCLING ELSEWHERE. THEY WOULD, OF COURSE, HAVE TO MAKE THE CHOICE TO USE ANN ARBOR'S MRF BUT IT WOULD LIKELY BE A VERY ATTRACTIVE CHOICE. GIVEN THE CLIMATE EMERGENCY WE FACE, FRANKLY, I WOULD PROPOSE THAT WE REDEVELOP THE ANN ARBOR MRF EVEN IF IT WERE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE OTHER PROPOSAL. WE'RE NO LONGER IN A BUSINESS AS USUAL ENVIRONMENT. BUT FORTUNATELY, IT'S NOT MORE EXPENSIVE. IT'S CONSIDERABLY LESS EXPENSIVE. THE PRICING STRUCTURE THAT RECYCLE ANN ARBOR OFFERED THE CITY. WOULD PROTECT THE CITY FROM THE RISK OF COLLAPSING MARKETS WHICH SEEMS IMPORTANT. LAST, BUT NOT LEAST -- AND I'M NOT QUITE SURE HOW TO SAY THIS, MY FAITH -- AND I'M SORRY I HAVE A LOT OF FEELINGS ABOUT THIS. MY FAITH TRADITION AND INTERFAITH COUNCIL PUT A VERY HIGH VALUE ON FIGURING OUT HOW TO WORK WITH PEOPLE WE DISAGREE WITH. IT'S NOT AN EASY THING TO DO. I CANNOT CLAIM TO BE AN EXPERT AT IT, ALTHOUGH I WORK AT IT. BUT I FEEL LIKE THERE'S A HUGE CLIMATE PROBLEM FACING ALL OF US AND I REALLY HOPE THAT WE CAN FIGURE OUT WAYS TO WORK TOGETHER TO SOLVE IT, DESPITE OUR DIFFERENCES. THANK YOU.
00:18:53.053: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. [ APPLAUSE ] OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS LAUREN SARGENT.
00:19:01.661: >> HELLO. I'M LAUREN SARGENT. I WAS BEFORE A DIFFERENT COUNCIL ALMOST 30 YEARS AGO WHEN WE PASSED THE ENVIRONMENTAL BOND TO ESTABLISH OUR LOCALLY CONTROLLED MRF AND AT THAT TIME, ANN ARBOR WAS A NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED LEADER IN RECYCLING AND RESOURCE RECOVERY. WE ARE AT A CRISIS POINT, BUT IT'S A CRISIS/OPPORTUNITY TO RECLAIM THAT LEADERSHIP POSITION. AND 30 YEARS AGO, ALMOST 30 YEARS AGO BEING THE PUBLIC SPOKE AND SAID WE WANTED A PUBLICLY OWNED AND LOCALLY CONTROLLED MRF AND RECYCLING SYSTEM. AND IT'S ALSO LESS EXPENSIVE THAN THE ALTERNATIVES WITHOUT EVEN CONSIDERING THE CARBON IMPACT, WE ARE NOW IN A DECLARED CLIMATE EMERGENCY THAT WE ALL DECLARED HERE. THIS IS THE TIME TO RECOMMIT TO THE GOALS THAT WE SET FORTH ALMOST 30 YEARS AGO, THOSE GOALS ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER. AND SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT JAN AND TOM MENTIONED, WE NEED LOCAL CONTROL, LOCAL JOBS, COMMITMENT TO HIGH QUALITY END PRODUCTS BUT ALSO THE MARKET-BASED APPROACH TREATING OUR RECYCLABLES AS A COMMODITY ON THE INTERNATIONAL MARKETS IS A DISASTER. IT'S THAT WORLD VIEW AND THAT MODEL THAT'S GOTTEN US AT THE PRECIPICE OF PLANETARY COLLAPSE. LET'S BACK UP AND RECOMMIT TO THE GOALS THAT WE SET FORWARD ALMOST 30 YEARS AGO. AND I SUPPORT THE R.A.A. PROPOSAL TO REPURPOSE THE MRF AND RECOMMIT TO THOSE GOALS.
00:20:36.423: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. [ APPLAUSE ] OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS PRISCILLA CHEEVER.
00:20:45.098: >> YES, I'M PRISCILLA CHEEVER AND I'M A RESIDENT OF THE 5 5th WARD. I'M HERE TONIGHT TO SUPPORT THE SUBSTITUTE PROPOSAL TO RECONSIDER THE R.A.A. BID. I, LIKE OTHER SPEAKERS, AND MANY TAXPAYERS HAVE BEEN CONCERNED THAT $6 MILLION THAT WE SPENT ON THE MATERIAL RECOVERY FACILITY, IT NOW JUST SITS IDLE. IN ADDITION, THE REST OF -- OR MUCH OF THE REST OF THE COUNTY HAS GAP A COOPERATIVE EFFORT TO DO RECYCLING. I SEE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE CITY OF NOMAR GARCIAPARRA TO REOPEN THE MATERIAL RECOVERIES FACILITY, COOPERATE WITH THE REST OF THE COUNTY, OR AS MUCH OF IT AS IS IN THE COALITION AT THIS TIME AND BECOME A LEADER IN SUSTAINABILITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL GOODNESS. THAT'S WHAT WE SAY WE ARE ABOUT, AND IT SHOULD BE WHAT WE ARE ABOUT. SO LET'S RETHINK WHAT WE ARE DOING, AND GO WITH THE SUBSTITUTE PROPOSAL. I ALSO NOTICED THAT THERE WERE A NUMBER OF WORKERS HERE WHO ARE CURRENTLY EMPLOYED AND HAVE DECENT PAYING JOBS AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THEM CONTINUE TO HAVE THOSE JOBS INSTEAD OF US CREATING JOBS IN LANSING OR SOMEWHERE ELSE. REALLY, IT'S TIME FOR US TO STEP UP AND DO THE RIGHT THING, WHICH IS TO GO WITH THE SUBSTITUTE. THANK YOU.
00:22:08.615: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. [ APPLAUSE ] OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS CHRIS VANDENBROEK.
00:22:17.924: >> GOOD EVENING, MY NAME IS CHRIS VANDENBROEK. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME TO SPEAK AND THANK YOU ALSO FOR PASSING THE RESOLUTION TO BECOME CARBON NEUTRAL BY 2030. I'M A Ph.D. MECHANICAL ENGINEER AND A LIFELONG RESIDENT OF ANN ARBOR. I'M HERE TO VOICE SUPPORT FOR REBUILDING THE ANN ARBOR MATERIALS REBUIL RECYCLING FACI. EVERYONE USES THE PHRASE MRF. I BRING A LIFELONG COMMITMENT TO ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES AND A DECENT UNDERSTANDING OF THE SCIENCE OF CLIMATE CHANGE. SO I HAVE THE FOLLOWING OBSERVATIONS. POOR RECYCLING NEGATIVELY IMPACTS CLIMATE HEALTH. I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE WE NEED TO MINIMIZE CONSUMPTION AND AVOID SUBSEQUENTBURYING OR BURNING OF WASTE, TO MEET CASH OP NEUTRALITY BY 2030. GLASS AND PLASTICS CAN BE EFFECTIVELY RECOVERED. THAT MEANS IT HAS TO BE SORTED. THE LOCAL MRF HAS THE FOLLOWING ADVANTAGES. IT AVOIDS THE EMISSIONS OF TRANSPORT. IT AVOIDS COMPACTION RECYCLABLES WHICH INCREASES CONTAMINATION AND REDUCES THE ABILITY TO SORT. IT AVOIDS THE BURNING SOME OF MASTICS. IT PROMOTES HIGHER VALUE RECOVERED PRODUCTS, FOR EXAMPLE GLASS BECOMES BOTTLES AND NOT NECESSARILY JUST GROUND UP INTO LOW GRADE ROAD MATERIAL. AND WE CAN BECOME A HUB FOR THE REGION, INCLUDING NEIGHBORING CITIES LIKE YPSILANTI. WE DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH MRFS IN MICHIGAN AT THE PRESENT TIME. THE CURRENT ALTERNATIVE, NAMELY TO TRANSPORT RECYCLABLES TO LANSING HAS SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES OF TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS, INCREASED CONTAMINATION RESULTING IN POORER RECOVERY AND THE BURNING OF SOME MATERIALS. ANN ARBOR IS FORTUNATE TO HAVE A HISTORY OF A LOCAL RESOURCE TO ACHIEVE OUR RECYCLING OBJECTIVES. ANN ARBOR HAS EXPERIENCE AND A GREAT DEAL OF INTEREST AND MOTIVATION TO RECYCLE IN AN OPTIMUM FASHION. TWO FINAL POINTS. WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE OUR COMMUNITY AND THE CITY GOVERNMENT'S VAST COLLECTIVE RESOURCES TO NURTURE AND REKINDLE THE LOCAL MRF. AND THE FINAL POINT, COMMUNICATE A STRONG MESSAGE TO THE LOCAL COMMUNITY THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY TAKING SERIOUSLY THE RESOLUTION THAT Y'ALL PASSED A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO WITH CARBON NEUTRALITY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [ APPLAUSE ]
00:24:50.143: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS ERIC LIPSON.
00:24:54.847: >> GOOD EVENING, MR. MAYOR, COUNCIL. ERIC LIPSON, 1318 ROSEWOOD, ANN ARBOR. THE PEOPLE WHO PRECEDED ME DID AN INCREDIBLE JOB OF SAYING WHY IT IS -- OR SOME OF THE REASONS WHY YOU GUYS SHOULD VOTE TO USE THE ALTERNATE RATHER THAN THE -- THE PROPOSAL PUT FORWARD BY STAFF REGARDING THE RECYCLING CONTRACT. I THINK IT'S PRETTY CLEAR FOR A BUNCH OF POLICY REASONS, BEYOND MERELY THE NUMBERS, BECAUSE NUMBERS TELL ONLY PART OF THE STORY, BUT FOR A BUNCH OF POLICY REASONS WHICH HAVE BEEN STATED BEFORE, THAT THIS COMMITTEE -- THIS COUNCIL SHOULD VOTE FOR THAT. YOU GUYS, YOU KNOW, WOULD KNOWS WHAT THE NUMBERS SAY. RIGHT NOW I SENT YOU FOLKS A LINK TO AN ARTICLE IN THE WINNIPEG NEWSPAPER TALKING ABOUT HOW EMTERRA IS IN A $67 MILLION LAWSUIT WITH THE CITY OF WINNIPEG OVER THEIR FORMER RECYCLING CONTRACT, BECAUSE THE CITY IS SAYING EMTERRA IS LOW BALLING THEIR NUMBERS, AND EMTERRA IS SAYING THEY GAVE THEM BAD INFORMATION. IT'S A $67 MILLION PROBLEM. AND WHERE IS EMTERRA GOING TO GET THEIR STAFF IF THEY WERE TO START UP OUT OF WHERE? ZEUS' FOREHEAD? NO, THEY WILL HAVE TO HIRE RECYCLE ANN ARBOR STAFF WHO WILL LOSE THE BENEFITS AND THE SENIORITY THAT THEY HAD UP UNTIL THAT POINT. LET'S WALK THE WALK HERE, BOTH ON CARBON NEUTRALITY AND ON HUMAN RIGHTS AS FAR AS UNION WAGES GO AND MAKE THE CLEARLY CORRECT DECISION TO STAY WITH THE ORGANIZATION WHICH HAS STAYED WITH US FOR 40 YEARS WITHOUT REALLY A HITCH. I MEAN, YES, THERE HAVE BEEN SOME ISSUES. THERE'S ISSUES WITH THE TRUCKS RIGHT NOW, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BUT IT'S BEEN A SCANDAL-FREE ORGANIZATION FOR THAT TIME AND I THINK THAT WE SHOULD STAND BY THEM AND STAND BY ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE. THEY HAVE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN WORKING THERE FOR 20 YEARS WHO I PERSONALLY KNOW WHO ARE INCREDIBLY HARD-WORKING PEOPLE. AND THAT'S INCREDIBLE. THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT RECYCLE ANN ARBOR WILL BE ABLE TO USE TO SCALE UP. IT WILL BE EASIER FOR THEM TO SCALE UP THAN FOR SOMEONE TO COME FROM OUT OF TOWN. THEY ARE DOING IT. THEIR GENERAL MANAGER, BRIAN HAS 30 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN THIS. SO IT JUST -- IT -- THE IDEA OF USING SPECULATIVE NUMBERS TO SPACE YOUR DECISION ON, RATHER THAN FIRM POLICY DECISION. AND FINALLY, I HEARD THAT -- THIS COUNCIL WAS CONCERNED ABOUT NOT HAVING LEVERAGE ON THE REGIONAL WASTE AUTHORITY. IF YOU OWN THE MRF, YOU WILL HAVE A LOT OF LEVERAGE AND THAT WILL BE THE VISIONARY KIND OF THING THAT WE WANT TO SEE FROM OUR COUNCIL, LIKE, FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN THE COUNCIL BOUGHT THE MICHIGAN THEATER OR WHEN THE CITY BOUGHT THE MICHIGAN THEATER RATHER THAN TAKING IT DOWN AND TURNING IT INTO ANOTHER HIGH-RISE. THAT WAS VISIONARY. THANK YOU.
00:27:59.532: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. [ APPLAUSE ] OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS GRACE SINGLETON.
00:28:05.938: >> GOOD EVENING, COUNCILMEMBERS AND MAYOR TAYLOR. MY NAME IS GRACE SINGLETON, I'M A PARTNER AT ZINGERS DELICATESSEN. AND I'M A PARTICIPATE IN THE SOLID WASTE PLAN ADVISORY COMMITTEE. I HAVE BEEN PAYING ATTENTION TO THE SOLID WASTE DECISIONS AND I'M HERE TO SUPPORT THE DECISION TO REBUILD THE MRF. RECYCLE ANN ARBOR'S PROPOSAL IS A LOWER COST PROPOSAL AT CURRENT MARKET PRICES. RECYCLING MARKETS ARE VOLATILE, AND RECYCLE ANN ARBOR'S PROPOSAL PROTECTS THE CITY WHEN THE MARKETS ARE LOW AND WHEN MARKETS ARE STRONG, THE PROPOSAL IS ALSO BENEFICIAL FOR THE CITY. INVESTING IN LOCAL BUSINESSES AND ORGANIZATIONS BUILDS OUR COMMUNITIES WELL. IT CREATES LOCAL JOBS, LOCAL INVESTMENT, LOCAL CONTROL, RECYCLE ANN ARBOR HAS 40 YEARS EXPERIENCE OPERATING WITHIN THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR AND HAS BEEN NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED FOR THEIR RECYCLING EXPERIENCE. THEY ARE COMMITTED TO OUR CITY AND UNDERSTAND THE EXISTING SITUATIONS, CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES. THEY ARE COMMITTED TO THE EDUCATIONAL COMPONENT OF THE RECYCLING PROCESS THAT IS CONSIDERED A KEY FACTOR FOR ALL SUCCESSFUL RECYCLING PROGRAM. UTILIZING A LOCAL PARTNER ALLOWS FOR COORDINATION OF THE RECYCLING NEEDS IN THE FUTURE AND SUPPORTS MORE RECYCLING OPTIONS IN THE REGION. A LOCALLY OPERATED ANN ARBOR MRF ENSURES THAT MATERIALS ARE RECYCLES AND TRANSPARENCY ABOUT WHERE AND WHAT THEY ARE GETTING RECYCLED FOR. RECYCLING ANN ARBOR IS COMMITTED TO GETTING THE HIGHEST VALUE AND MATERIALS FOR THE RECYCLING CAPTURE. ONE EXAMPLE OF THAT IS FINDING A MARKET FOR RECYCLING GLASS THAT CAN BE USED FOR INSULATION OR THE MANUFACTURING OF GLASS BOTTLES RATHER THAN HAVING A LOW VALUE USE RATHER THAN GLASS FOR ROAD BASED. THERE SEEMS TO BE STRONG RESISTANCE FROM THE CITY TO REOPEN THE MRF AS A SORTING FACILITY. THERE ARE CLAIMS THAT THE EQUIPMENT CANNOT BE REUSED REFIDUCREFURBISHED OR REUPDATED. I HAVE OVER 20 YEARS EXPERIENCE OVERSEEING BUILDING FACILITIES AND I CAN'T TELL YOU THE NUMBER OF TIMES THAT I HAVE TALKED TO A TECHNICIAN ABOUT A PIECE OF EQUIPMENT THAT THEY SAID IT NEEDED TO BE RETIRED AND IT COULDN'T BE REUSED. AFTER CONSULTING WITH OTHER TECHNICIANS AND GETTING DIFFERENT OPINIONS A SOLUTION WAS FOUND THAT MINIMIZED THE COST AND ALLOWED THE REUSE OF SOME COMPONENTS. A WILLINGNESS AND OPENNESS TO CREDIT POTENTIAL USE OF SOME OF THE MRF STATION EQUIPMENT SHOULD BE RECONSIDERED. WE HAVE A COMMITTED VENDOR WHO UNDERSTANDS THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR AND THE RECYCLING NEEDS AND THEY WANT TO BE A PARTNER WITH US INTO THE FUTURE TO CAPTURE, IN THE AMOUNT OF REUSABLE GOODS THAT COULD BE MADE FROM THAT CAN'TURE. WE CAN EACH -- CAPTURE. WE CAN DO OUR PART, BIKE TO WORK BUT YOUR DECISION WILL HAVE A MUCH MORE SUBSTANTIAL AND LONG-TERM IMPACT ON OUR COMMUNITY AND THE ENTIRE REGION. I URGE YOU TO ALLOW RECYCLE ANN ARBOR TO TO GET THE MRF FUNCTIONAL AS A RESOURCE FOR ANN ARBOR AND THE REGION. THANK YOU.
00:31:03.783: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS PAULINA LUNG. LEUNG.
00:31:16.362: >> THANK YOU FOR AYOU LOWENSTEINING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU. AS YOU CAN SEE THIS WAS A LAST-MINUTE DECISION. SO I DO HAVE MY NOTES TYPED OUT INSTEAD OF PRINTED. MY NAME IS PAULINA. I EMTERRA ENVIRONMENTAL U.S.A. WE ARE A FAMILY BUSINESS. AND WE ARE AN AMERICAN COMPANY. OUR STAFF ARE LOCAL MANAGEMENT TEAM ALL RESIDE IN MICHIGAN AND WE ARE REGISTERED COMPANY IN MICHIGAN. THERE ARE A LOT OF COMMONALTIES BETWEEN MY COMPANY, MYSELF AND MANY OF THESE SPEAKERS THAT HAVE COME BEFORE ME. I THINK WE ACTUALLY HAVE MORE COMMONALTIES THAN DIFFERENCES. WE ALL BELIEVE THERE'S A CLIMATE EMERGENCY. THE WORD OF YEAR FOR 2018 AND 2019 WITH SINGLE USE IN 2018 AND 2019 IT WAS CLIMATE STRIKE. WE ARE A RECYCLING COMPANY FIRST AND FOREMOST. WE HAVE 14 MRF ACROSS CANADA. HOPEFULLY WE WILL HAVE ONE MORE TO SERVE IN MICHIGAN. YOU KNOW, OUR BUSINESS IS FOUNDED ON TAKING WASTE AND TURNING IT INTO SOMETHING VALUABLE. WE HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR 43 YEARS. YOU MAY SAY, OH, THEY DON'T HAVE A MRF IN THE U.S.A. GRANTED, THAT IS A VALID CRITIQUE. BUT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE NUMBER OF FACILITIES WE HAVE, ESPECIALLY THE NUMBER OF FACILITIES WE HAVE FROM ONTARIO, WHO IS JUST ACROSS THE LAKE, AS PART OF THE GREAT LAKES REGION, THAT REGION HAS MORE SIMILARITIES IN TERMS OF THE COMPOSITION OF THE RECYCLABLES, THE END MARKETS THAT THE RECYCLABLES ARE SOLD TO, THAN OUR COUNTERPARTS IN THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST. MICHIGAN AND ONTARIO AND A THE WHOLE MIDWEST AREA IS MORE COMMON IN TERMS OF RECYCLING CHALLENGES, THE LACK OF DOMESTIC END MARKETS THAN THE PACIFIC IN THE AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT. -- THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST, AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT. EACH YEAR WE PROCESS MARKETS AND ARRANGE FOR THE LOGISTICS OF 750 SHORE TONS, NOT METRIC TONS. ANN ARBOR'S TONNAGE REPRESENTS ABOUT 1.6% OF THAT. THIS IS NOT TO SAY THAT IT'S NOT IMPORTANT. EVERY TON IS VALUABLE. THE POINT IN ME POINTING THAT OUT IS THAT WE HAVE THE VOLUME, THE CONTRACTS WITH DIFFERENT END MARKETS, AND THE RANGE TO NEGOTIATE THE BEST PRICING FOR THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. ONE THING THAT'S FOR CERTAIN IS THAT THE LAST TWO YEARS OF THE RECYCLING INDUSTRY -- AND I HAVE ONLY BEEN IN IT FOR 15 YEARS WITH THE FAMILY BUSINESS. IT'S BEEN THE MOST TURBULENT AND WE TRIED TO REFLECT THAT IN A POSITIVE WAY IN OUR PROPOSAL. WE HAVE FOUR OPTICAL SORTERS. WE HAVE BALLISTIC SORTERS. WE HAVE TWO EDDIE CURRENTS, A MAGNET. WE HAVE A BALERS. WE HAVE ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT TO BE HONEST, ITS USEFUL LIFE WILL PROBABLY BE NEAR END BY FIVE YEARS. AND THAT'S WHY WE PROPOSED A FIVE-YEAR CONTRACT. THE REASON IS THE RECYCLING INDUSTRY CAN BARELY KEEP UP WITH THE RANGE AND THE DIVERSITY OF PACKAGING THAT COMPANIES, RETAILERS, FAST FOOD RESTAURANTS PUT OUT AND WE ALL BUY AND CONSUME BECAUSE WE NEED IT FOR OUR DAILY LIVES. TO KEEP UP WITH THAT KIND OF CHANGE IN PACKAGING, WE HAVE TO INVEST IN A LOT, AND MRFS CANNOT BE BUILT AND JUST LET SIT FOR 10, 20 YEARS. IF DO YOU THAT, WE WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO KEEP UP WITH THE CHANGES. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION. THANK YOU.
00:34:20.346: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS JOAN LOWENSTEIN.
00:34:29.822: >> HI, I THINK JAN WRIGHT, WOULD SPOKE FROM IPCJ SPOKE FROM THE HEART AND HOW IT'S A COMMUNITY ISSUE AND IT'S A WAY FOR OUR COMMUNITY TO ALL COME TOGETHER. IT'S REALLY WHAT MAKES ANN ARBOR ANN ARBOR. AND I WANT TO THANK COUNCILMEMBERS EATON AND SMITH FOR COMING UP WITH THIS NEW PROPOSAL TO KEEP THE RECYCLING HERE IN THE CITY, AND TO KEEP IT -- KEEP IT LOCAL. AND I WANTED TO STRESS THE EDUCATIONAL VALUE, BECAUSE I THINK A LOT OF US WHO HAVE RAISED KIDS HERE REMEMBER THE KIDS GOING ON FIELD TRIPS TO THE MRF, LEARNING ABOUT RECYCLING, LEARNING ABOUT IT AS SOMETHING YOU DO EVERY DAY, BECAUSE HAVING IT BE PART OF WHAT WE ARE LOCALLY SEEING LOCAL PEOPLE BRING THOSE TRUCKS UP AND THERE WAS A BOOK THAT CAME OUT -- I WAS LOOKING FOR IT, BUT I MUST HAVE RECYCLED IT. THAT CAME OUT 30 YEARS AGO. GRACE PROBABLY REMEMBERS IT. A BOOK ABOUT RECYCLE ANN ARBOR AND IT'S SORT OF LIKE THE RECYCLER IS A MEMBER OF YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD KIND OF THING. WHICH WAS GREAT. AND KIDS DO REMEMBER THAT! THEY REMEMBER ABOUT NOT JUST THROWING THINGS AWAY AND RECYCLING THEM AND GOING TO THE MRF AND LEARNING ABOUT WHERE THINGS GO AND HOW HARD IT IS TO RECYCLE THINGS AND WHY YOU HAVE TO WORK A LITTLE AT IT, AND IT'S NOT JUST AN EASY THING TO DO. I KNOW YOU HAVE GOTTEN A LOT OF MATERIALS AND SOME OF THEM HAVE BEEN -- I WANTED TO JUST GIVE A SHOUT OUT TO SOME REALLY GREAT EDUCATORS. NANCY STONE WOULD IS OVER THIS HIDING BEHIND THE PILLAR, WHO USED TO WORK FOR THE CITY. AND ALSO DAN EZEKIEL WHO IS OVER HERE, WHO IS NOW PRESIDENT OF THE LOCAL CHAPTER OF THE SIERRA CLUB. SO PLEASE REMEMBER THE EDUCATIONAL VALUE IN THIS AND ALSO REMEMBER, AS I THINK SOME OTHER PEOPLE HAVE ALLUDED TO, THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO INVEST IN. IT'S NOT JUST A CONTRACT AND SOMETHING WE NEED TO THROW OUT AND SAY WHAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE, BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO INVEST IN AS A COMMUNITY. THANKS.
00:36:31.076: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. [ APPLAUSE ] OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS WILL HATHAWAY.
00:36:41.620: >> GOOD EVENING. MY NAME IS WILL HATHAWAY AND I'M HERE TO SPEAK TONIGHT IN SUPPORT OF DC-5, THE RESOLUTION REGARDING THE CENTER OF THE CITY INTERIM USE AND LONG-TERM PLANNING. FIRST, I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE MEMBERS OF CITY COUNCIL WHO OFFERED PUBLIC COMMENTS MEMORIALIZING MY MOTHER, MARY HATHAWAY, AFTER HER DEATH IN OCTOBER. IT MEANT A LOT TO OUR FAMILY. WILE WE HAVEN'T, ALL OF US, ALWAYS AGREED ON EVERYTHING, MOM MAINTAINED HER HOPE THAT CITY COUNCIL AND THE CITY GOVERNMENT WOULD EVENTUALLY RALLY AND SUPPORT THE CREATION OF A DOWNTOWN PARK THAT WE WILL ALL BE PROUD OF. SHE MAINTAINED HER FAITH IN YOU. THAT VISION FOR A DOWNTOWN PARK AND CIVIC CENTER IS WHY I AM HERE TONIGHT. THE RESOLUTION THAT YOU WILL CONSIDER IS MEANT TO EXPRESS CITY COUNCIL'S VIEW THAT IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CHARTER AMENDMENT IS IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE DOWNTOWN DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY'S MISSION. THE RESOLUTION TAKES CARE NOT TO OVERSTEP, HOWEVER, IT IS COMPLETELY APPROPRIATE FOR THE COUNCIL TO COMMUNICATE WHAT IT HOPES THE D.D.A. WILL DO. GIVING DIRECTION TO THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR TO INITIATE DISCUSSIONS AND NEGOTIATIONS IS THE METHOD FOR THIS COMMUNICATION. IT IS ALSO APPROPRIATE FOR THE CITY COUNCIL TO SIGNAL ITS GOALS FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CITY CHARTER, WITH REGARD TO PLANNING FOR THE CITY'S BUDGET. THAT PROCESS WILL COMMENCE IN THE NEW YEAR, AND THE EARLIER THAT STAFF CAN BEGIN TO PLAN, THE BETTER. THE RESOLUTION DRAWS ON THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR'S RECOMMENDATION TO THE CITY COUNCIL IN THE 9/23/19 MEMORANDUM ON INTERIM STEPS TO IMPLEMENT THAT CENTER OF THE CITY CHARTER AMENDMENT. IT ALSO DRAWS ON A 2014 PROPOSAL THAT THE PARKS ADVISORY COMMISSION MADE TO CITY COUNCIL FOR THE CREATION OF A STAFF POSITION TO FOCUS ON PROGRAMMING AND OVERSIGHT OF DOWNTOWN PARKS. THIS IS AN IDEA FROM P.A.C., INFORMED BY P.A.C.'S 2013 STUDY OF PARKS AND OPEN SPACES. I HAVE HEARD SOME ASSERT THAT PROMISES WERE MADE THAT THE CITY WOULD NOT HAVE TO FUND THE CREATION OF A PARK ON THE LIBRARY LOT. THAT STATEMENT MADE BY AN INDIVIDUAL IN 2015 WAS CONTINGENT ON CITY COUNCIL HALTING ITS MOVEMENT TOWARDS SELLING THE LIBRARY LOT TO A PRIVATE DEVELOPER. AS WE KNOW, CITY COUNCIL DID NOT STOP. IT IS NOT FAIR TO HOLD THAT INDIVIDUAL TO HIS SIDE OF THE BARGAIN, NOR IS IT FAIR TO CONFLATE HIS OFFER INTO A PROMISE BY NIP  ANYONE OTHER THN HIM. SO LET'S DROP THAT PRETEND ISSUE. WILL OUR GROUP REMAIN COMMITTED TO RAISING MONEY THROUGH SEEKING DONATIONS AND GRANTS? YES. DID WE EVER PROMISE TO PAY FOR THE PARK OURSELVES THROUGH PRIVATE FUNDING? NO. I HOPE THE CITY WILL TAKE THIS STEP FORWARD TO CREATE THE CENTER OF THE CITY. THANK YOU.
00:39:43.368: >> Chair Mil
00:39:46.071: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. ARE THERE COMMUNICATIONS TODAY FROM COUNCIL? COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
00:39:54.279: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I HAVE BEEN WORKING ON A COMMUNICATIONS RESOLUTION THAT I PLAN TO BRING FORWARD AT THE NEXT COUNCIL MEETING. I THINK THAT WHAT WE SAW TONIGHT IS HOW IMPORTANT COMMUNICATION IS AND I WANT TO THANK ALL THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO CAME OUT TONIGHT TO COMMUNICATE WITH US. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT RESPONSIBILITIES OF A COUNCILMEMBER IS TO COMMUNICATE THE COMMUNITY'S VALUES TO STAFF, AND I APOLOGIZE BECAUSE I THINK WE HAVE FAILED AND THAT'S WHY WE ARE HERE TONIGHT. BACK TO MY RESOLUTION, AND IT'S FOCUSING ON TRANSPARENCY, COLLABORATION AND THE ACCURACY OF DATA. I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE ALL THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO HAVE GIVEN ME FEEDBACK ON THIS RESOLUTION. AND ONE POINTED OUT THAT IN OUR CITY CHARTER, SECTION 18.2, IS A RELEVANT STATEMENT. ALL RECORDS OF THE CITY SHALL BE PUBLIC, SHALL BE KEPT IN CITY OFFICES, EXCEPT WHEN REQUIRED FOR OFFICIAL REASONS OR FOR PURPOSES OF SAFE KEEPING TO BE ELSEWHERE AND SHALL BE AVAILABLE FOR INSPECTION AT ALL REASONABLE TIMES. I KNOW THAT THIS WAS WRITTEN BEFORE THE INTERNET, BUT I THIS IT'S REALLY SAD WHEN COUNCILMEMBERS HAVE TO FOIA SIMPLY TO GET PUBLIC RECORDS THAT ARE AVAILABLE PER THE CHARTER. NUMBER TWO, I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE IMPROVED COMMUNICATIONS WITH SOME OF OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS, INCLUDING OUR COUNTY COMMISSIONERS, AND THE UNIVERSITY LEADERSHIP AS WELL AS THE STUDENTS. THE CENTRAL STUDENT GOVERNMENT JUST CREATED A GOVERNMENT RELATIONS DIVISION. THESE ARE THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN STUDENTS WHO REPRESENT THE STUDENT BODY THROUGH CENTRAL STUDENT GOVERNMENT, AND THEY HAVE CREATED A GOVERNMENT RELATIONS DIVISION, WHICH IS A MAJOR STEP BECAUSE K NOT ONLY AE THEY NOT INVOLVED IN CLIMATE CHANGE AND A LOT OF NATIONAL ISSUES. THEY ARE NOW INTERESTED IN WHAT'S HAPPENING INANN ARBOR. THANK YOU.
00:42:07.980: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER COMMUNICATIONS FROM COUNCIL? COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
00:42:11.249: >> Councilmember Bannister: WHY YES. I WANT TO THANK MY COUNCIL COLLEAGUES AT OUR LAST METER OF NOVEMBER 18, APPROVING THE RESOLUTION 19-2216, HOOKING2216T THE FEASIBILITY OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AT 587 PACKARD. WE ARE MOVING FORWARD ON PREPARING A TIMELINE AND NEXT STEPS ON THAT ISSUE. WE ARE LOOKING AT DIFFERENT SOURCES OF FUNDING AND PUTTING IT IN THE CONTEXT OF OUR NEW A20 PLAN AND THE COMMUNITY VISION AND MASTER LAND USE PLAN. WE ARE ALSO LOOKING AT THE MALLETTS CREEK SHED THAT IS CURRENTLY GRADE LEVEL F IN SEVERAL IMPORTANT CATEGORIES. SO JUST A QUICK UPSET ON THAT. WE ARE WORKING ON THAT. -- UPDATE ON THAT. WE ARE WORKING ON THAT. A COUPLE OF PARKING ISSUES. WE HAD OUR MEETING ON NOVEMBER 6th INTERNALLY WITH STAFF MEMBERS AND WE ARE TRYING TO MOVE TOWARDS A MORE USER-FRIENDLY RESIDENTIAL PARKING PERMIT MAPPING COMPONENT, AND WE'RE ALSO CONSIDERING INCREASED ENFORCEMENT OF PEOPLE PARKED, PERHAPS ILLEGALLY IN RESIDENTIAL PARKING MER MITT DISTRICTS. WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT IMPROVING OF OUR -- AND EXPANDING OUR PARK AND RIDE, AND ALSO ISSUES RELATED TO BIG TRUCKS DOWNTOWN. SO THOSE PARKING ISSUES ARE PROCEEDING. ALSO AS THE PARKING RELATES TO THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT WE MOVED FORWARD WITH AT THE CATHERINE AND 4th LOT, WE HAVE REQUESTED AN HISTORICAL PARKING DATA AND TRENDS FOR THAT EXISTING SURFACE LOT, AND WE'RE ALSO LOOKING TO COMMUNICATE ENGAGEMENT AND LOCAL BUSINESS ENGAGEMENT AS WE LOOK AT THE DATA ON HOW MANY CARS ARE CURRENTLY PARKING THERE IN THE RECENT HISTORY. AND THEN JUST LASTLY, A COUPLE OF OTHER ISSUES THAT THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION WILL BE BRINGING FORTH IN DECEMBER AND JANUARY, WE'RE WORKING ON PROTECTION FOR HERITAGE TREES, AND WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT -- WORKING WITH FOOD GATHERERS ON SOME OF THEIR GOOD THINGS THAT THEY DO FOR THE COMMUNITY WITH REGARDS TO THE METHANE GAS THAT THEY HELPED TO LIMIT THROUGH THEIR USAGE -- THROUGH THEIR RECYCLING AND REUSING OF FOOD. SO THOSE FOOD GATHERERS RESOLUTION AND PRESENTATION, AND HERITAGE TREES, THOSE WILL BE COMING FORTH AT ANOTHER COUNCIL MEETING IN THE NEAR FUTURE.
00:45:07.159: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
00:45:08.059: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. I HOPE EVERYONE HAD A GREAT HOLIDAY WEEKEND. AND WHAT A WAY TO COME BACK TO THAT INTRODUCTION AND CHECK TO THE CITY FOR $882,000 BY H.U.D. I APPRECIATE THE SPEAKER WOULD SPOKE AND THE EFFECTS IT HAS ON HER LIFE. IT'S REALLY A GREAT WAY TO START TONIGHT'S MEETING TO SEE THAT, PROGRAMS THAT HAVE A HUGE IMPACT ON PEOPLE'S LIVES. SO I JUST WANTED TO THANK THE ANN ARBOR HOUSING COMMISSION, WITH ALL THE WORK THAT THEY DO. WE ARE LUCKY TO HAVE THAT INSTITUTION HERE, THAT WE REALLY HAD SOME FORWARD THINKING PEOPLE AND I HOPE WE CONTINUE TO -- BACK IN THE DAY WHEN THAT WAS FORMED, PUT THEM IN THE POSITION THAT THEY ARE TODAY TO DO SOME AMAZING THINGS THAT VERY FEW CITIES IN THE COUNTRY ARE DOING. AND THEN I ALSO WANT TO, YOU KNOW, BRING UP THE FACT THAT WE ALL WILL BE MEETING DECEMBER 12th TO DISCUSS THE GELMAN SITUATION, THE THREAT TO OUR DRINKING WATER, AND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING REGIONALLY TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE. I THINK MANY IN THE COMMUNITY ARE FED UP WITH THE STATUS QUO. SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING WHAT COMES OUT WHEN WE ALL MEET ON DECEMBER 12th. THANK YOU.
00:46:34.479: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION -- EXCUSE ME, FURTHER COMMUNICATIONS FROM COUNCIL? I WOULD LIKE TO REQUEST CONFIRMATION OF THE FOLLOWING APPOINTMENTS THAT WERE PRESENTED COUNCIL TESS NOVEMBER 18th TO THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION BOARD, JOHN FORNIER. TO THE EMPLOYEES RETIREE, AND THE VEBA, BROCK HASTIE. MAY I HAVE A MOTION. MOVED BY COUNCIL MEMBER SMITH. SECONDED BY RAMLAWI. DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. I WOULD LIKE TO, YOU KNOW, ECHO COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI'S THANKS TO THE GOOD PEOPLE FROM H.U.D. FOR COMING TODAY AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, OF COURSE, FOR THE PROGRAM THAT THEY RUN AND THE HOUSING COMMISSION FOR THEIR ABILITY AND FACILITY IN ACCEPTING THOSE H.U.D. FUNDS. THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY MUCH GREATER NEEDS THAN WE HAVE RESOURCES MUCH GREATER THAN WE HAVE NEEDS THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS ABLE TO GIVE RESOURCES AND I'M THANKFUL THAT WE GET TO BENEFIT FROM THE PROFESSIONALISM OF THE HOUSING COMMISSION. ONE EVENT THAT I WOULD LIKE TO IDENTIFY AND THAT IS THE ANN ARBOR 15th DISTRICT COURT HAS A WARRANT RESOLUTION DAY. THIS IS AT THE INITIATIVE OF MS. SLAY. ONE OF OUR CITY ATTORNEYS. ALL TOO OFTEN, FOLKS GO AROUND WITH WARRANTS THAT CREATE TROUBLES AND RISKS FOR THEM, OUTSTANDING WARRANTS AND IT CAN PREVENT PEOPLE FROM SEEKING OR SECURING EMPLOYMENT AND ASSISTANCE FOR THEMSELVES, THEIR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. THIS INCLUDES AT SITHE ASSISTANF SHELTER AND FOOD. ON MONDAY, NOVEMBER 16th, FROM NOON TO 8 P.M. THIS HAD BEEN MULTI AGENCIES AT THE ANN ARBOR JUSTICE CENTER FOR THE PURPOSES OF ENGAGING AND HOPEFULLY CLEARING WARRANTS. THE WARRANT RESOLUTION DAY WILL HAVE PUBLIC DEFENDERS, PROSECUTORS, JUDGES AN PROBATION AGENTS AVAILABLE TO ASSIST. THE GOAL IS TO CLEAR OUTSTANDING WARRANTS WHERE WE CAN, HOW WE CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE ARE TAKEN CARE OF APPROPRIATELY AND CLEANLY IN A WAY THAT ALLOWS PEOPLE TO GO ON WITH THEIR -- TO GO ON WITH THEIR LIVES. AND SO I HOPE THAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE OUTSTANDING WARRANTS WILL AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THIS OPPORTUNITY AND I GIVE MY THANKS TO MS. SLAY FOR THAT INITIATIVE. WE NOW HAVE BEFORE US THE CONSENT AGENDA. MAY I HAVE A MOTION TO APPROVE THE CONSENT AGENDA. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER SMITH. SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI. DISCUSSION OF THE CONSENT AGENDA?
00:49:17.909: >> Councilmember Smith: I WOULD LIKE TO PULL CA-7.
00:49:21.646: >> Mayor Taylor: CA-7. FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE CONSENT AGENDA. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
00:49:32.357: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I WOULD LIKE TO PULL CA-11.
00:49:36.428: >> Mayor Taylor: CA-11. FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR OF THE CONCEPT AGENDA WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CA-7 AND CA-11. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? THE CONSENT AGENDA IS APPROVED, W.CA-7, RESOLUTION TO APPROVE A SERVICES AGREEMENT WITH EMTERRA ENVIRONMENTAL U.S.A. CORP FOR MRF OPERATIONS AND RECYCLABLES PROCESSING. ESTIMATED FOR YEAR ONE WITH ONE POTENTIAL FIVE-YEAR EXTENSION. MOVED BY SMITH AND SECONDED BY RAMLAWI. COUNCILMEMBER SMITH.
00:50:14.065: >> Councilmember Smith: JACKIE HAS DISTRIBUTED A SUBSTITUTE RESOLUTION FOR THE COUNCIL TO CONSIDER. MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC, I HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH COUNCILMEMBER EATON THAT DIRECTS THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR TO ASSOCIATE WITH RECYCLE ANN ARBOR TO REOPEN OUR MATERIALS RECOVERY FACILITY, THIS REPLACEMENT RESOLUTION RESPONDS TO WHAT WE HEARD FROM THE NINE SPEAKERS THIS EVENING AND THE DOZENS OF EMAILS WE HAVE GOTTEN AND LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF CONVERSATIONS I HAVE HAD ABOUT THIS OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS. I THINK IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION HAS, SINCE I HAVE BEEN ON IT, HAD DISCUSSIONS AND CONTINUED TO RECOMMEND REOPENING THE MRF. WE HAD THE DIRECTOR OF THE MICHIGAN RECYCLING COALITION COME IN AND TELL US THAT THERE'S A SHORTAGE OF MATERIAL RECOVERY FACILITIES IN MICHIGAN. THE EMTERRA PROPOSAL, WHILE I APPRECIATE THEIR EXPER EXPERIENU KNOW, WE ARE SENDING OUR RECYCLABLES TO A SMALLER CITY, FARTHER AWAY. WE WERE ONCE A LEADER IN THIS FIELD. WE MADE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN OUR MRF. WE PASSED AN ENVIRONMENTAL BOND IN THE EARLY '90s. ALL OF THIS IS THE COMMUNITY SAYING, WE WANT TO DO THIS WORK HERE. WE CONTINUE TO HEAR THAT. I HAVE HEARD IT LOUD AND CLEAR ONLY THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION. SINCE THE MRF WAS SHUT DOWN, IT HAS BEEN A LONG, DIFFICULT, SLOG TO GET TO WHERE WE ARE, BUT I THINK THAT I'M VERY COMFORTABLE WITH THIS RESOLUTION DIRECTING THE ADMINISTRATOR TO NEGOTIATE WITH R.A.A. TO REOPEN THE MRF. I HAVE MADE ONE -- TWO SMALL CHANGES FROM THE VERSION THAT WAS POSTED ON LEGISTAR. ONE IS TO MAKE THIS A TEN-YEAR CONTRACT. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE TEN-YEAR TERM IMPACTS THE FINANCING TO REBUILD THE MRF. AND THE SECOND CHANGE I HAVE MADE IS THAT ONCE THE -- ONCE THE ADMINISTRATOR HAS NEGOTIATED AN AGREEMENT, THAT THAT AGREEMENT COME BACK TO COUNCIL FOR APPROVAL PRIOR TO EXECUTION.
00:53:01.899: >> Mayor Taylor: I'M TAKING THIS AS A MOTION.
00:53:03.635: >> Councilmember Smith: A MOTION TO SUBSTITUTE MY RESOLUTION.
00:53:10.375: >> Mayor Taylor: SECONDED BY COUNCIL MEMBER EATON. YOU HAVE THE FLOOR FOR ANOTHER 1:20.
00:53:14.345: >> Councilmember Smith: I'M DONE. I WILL HAND IT OFF TO SOMEBODY ELSE.
00:53:17.181: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. I'M SORRY. SO WHAT WE ARE DOING NOW, THIS IS ESSENTIALLY AN AMENDMENT -- IT IS PROPOSED THAT THIS RESOLUTION BE AN AMENDMENT TO THE MAIN MOTION THAT IS IN THE CONSENT AGENDA.
00:53:32.997: >> Councilmember Smith: WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO READ THIS?
00:53:34.198: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I HAVE A PROCEDURAL QUESTION?
00:53:38.436: >> Mayor Taylor: PLEASE.
00:53:38.970: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  IS IT POSSIBLE FOR THIS TO BE ITS OWN PIECE OF LEGISLATION, RATHER THAN A DIRECT SUBSTITUTE IN IT SHOULD BE A STANDALONE AND THE OTHER ONE BE VOTED UP OR DOWN OR THIS ONE BE VOTED UP OR DOWN.
00:53:50.448: >> Mayor Taylor: IN ORDER TO DO THAT -- THIS WILL SERVE THAT SAME FUNCTION. IN ORDER TO DO THAT, WE WOULD NEED TO AMEND THE -- AMEND THE AGENDA TO ADD THIS AS ESSENTIALLY CA-7B -- CA-71?
00:54:03.628: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  CAN I MAKE A MOTION TO --
00:54:09.467: >> Mayor Taylor: THIS HAS BEEN PROPOSED AS AN AMENDMENT, AS A RESOLUTION, WHICH BY AMENDMENT SUBSTITUTES FOR CA-7 AS IT WAS. [ OFF MICROPHONE COMMENTS ]
00:54:25.049: >> Mayor Taylor: YES. SO DISCUSSION OF THIS AMENDMENT TO THE ARE E SOLUTION. ASK THAT FRIENDLY TO THE BODY?
00:54:34.992: >> Councilmember Lumm: NO.
00:54:35.560: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
00:54:36.728: >> Councilmember Lumm: I CAN MAKE MY COMMENTS NOW. I SUPPORT STAFF'S RECOMMENDATION. I WOULD LIKE A VOTE FOR THE SUBSTITUTE.
00:54:46.704: >> Mayor Taylor: ABSOLUTELY. YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
00:54:49.207: >> Councilmember Lumm: FIRST, I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO HAVE A VOTE AS A SUBSTITUTE.
00:54:54.946: >> Mayor Taylor: THERE'S AN AMENDMENT PROPOSED. THE AMENDMENT IS THIS SUBSTITUTE RESOLUTION. IF YOU ARE IN FAVOR OF IT, YOU ARE IN FAVOR OF THE AMENDMENT. IF YOU ARE OPPOSED TO IT, YOU ARE OPPOSED TO IT.
00:55:04.455: >> Councilmember Lumm: I'M OPPOSED TO IT. I WILL BE SUPPORTING STAFF'S RECOMMENDATION TONIGHT AND NOT THE SUBSTITUTE RESOLUTION. SHOULD I EXPLAIN WHY AT THIS JUNCTURE THEN?
00:55:15.066: >> Mayor Taylor: PLEASE.
00:55:15.633: >> Councilmember Lumm: FIRST, I WOULD LIKE TO THANK STAFF IN ALL OF THEIR GOOD WORK IN CONDUCTING A THOROUGH, OBJECTIVE AND VERY FAIR PROCESS FROM START TO FINISH, FROM THE RFP AND THE FLEXIBILITY IT ALLOWED TO THE EVALUATION AND THE SCORING. THE CITY UTILIZES A VERY ROBUST, WE CAN ITABLE PURCHASING PROCESS AND PRACTICES, AS A GENERAL RULE, AND THAT WAS CERTAINLY THE CASE HERE. THE SUBSTITUTE RESOLUTION MAKES A MOCKERY OF THE PROCESS HERE AND OF COMPETITIVE BIDDING IN GENERAL. NOT TO MENTION PLACING TAXPAYERS AT A SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL RISK. THE SUBSTITUTE SAYS WE NEVER WANTED ANYTHING AND WON'T ACCEPT ANYTHING OTHER THAN TO RECOMMISSION THE MRF AS A PROCESSING FACILITY. I DON'T AGREE THAT'S PRUDENT AND STAFF DOESN'T EITHER, BUT IF THAT WAS COUNCIL'S POSITION, IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN STATED BEFORE THE RFP WAS ISSUED. TO SAY NOW THAT R.A.A. WAS THE ONLY BID UNDER THAT OPTION, SO WE SHOULD NEGOTIATE WITH THEM, WHEN THE RFP SAID EITHER APPROACH WAS OKAY, IS DISHONESTLY AND MAKES THE PROCESS A SHAM. ENTER DIRECT NOTIONS TO R.A.A. WITHOUT OFFERING OTHERS AN OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT A PROPOSAL UNDER OPTION TWO, THE ONLY OPTION COUNCIL APPARENTLY FINDS ACCEPTABLE VIOLATES THE PRINCIPLES OF COMPETITIVE BIDDING. OBVIOUSLY THE KEY CONSIDERATION HERE IS TO DO WITH THE CITY'S MRF, CONTINUE -- IS WHAT TO DO WITH THE CITY'S MRF. CONTINUE ITS USE AS A TRANSLOADING FACILITY OR RE-INVEST IN MAKING IT A FACILITY THAT SORTS AND PROCESSES RECYCLABLES. THE MRF WAS BUILT IN THE MID-1990s AND IT IS ABSOLUTELY NOT CORRECT TO SUGGEST THAT USING THE FACILITY FOR TRANSLOADING ONLY SOMEHOW WASTES MONEY. IT'S FINANCE 101 THAT SUNK COSTS ARE IRRELEVANT, END QUOTE. WHAT IS THE BEST COURSE FOR THE CITY NOW? STAFF BELIEVES AND I AGREE, CONTINUING ITS USE AS A TRANSLOADING FACILITY MAKES THE MOST SENSE FROM A IF I DO YOU REMEMBERARRY STANDPOINT. IT MAXIMIZES FLEXIBILITIES AND MINIMIZES RISK IN A TURBULENT CHANGING RECYCLING ENVIRONMENT. RE-INVESTING IN THE MANY MRF TO DO SORTING AND PROCESSING DOES A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FINANCIAL RISK REGARDLESS OF WHO THE OPERATOR IS AND GIVE THAN R.A.A. HAS NO DIRECT EXPERIENCE OFFERING A PROCESSING FACILITY LIKE, THIS THE RISKS ARE COMPOUNDED EXPONENTIALLY, BOTH FINANCIALLY AND OPERATIONALLY, INCLUDING R.A.A.'S ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO PROCESS THE CITY'S RECYCLABLES DURING THE YEAR OR TWO IT AS TO RENOVATE THE MRF. PLUS, R.A.A.'S PROPOSAL REFURBISHES PROCESSING EQUIPMENT THE CITY HAS CONCLUDED NEEDS TO BE REPLACED FOR SAFETY REASONS. ON TOP OF FINANCIAL AND SAFETY RISKS YOU CAN ADD ATE RISK WITH R.A.A.'S PROPOSAL. WOULD YOU EXPECT R.A.A. WOULD SHARE THE BURDEN BUT THEY DON'T REALLY DO THAT EITHER. R.A.A. PROPOSES TO RECEIVE ALL OF THE COMMODITY RECYCLABLING REVENUE UNTIL IT REACHES $45 A TON. ITS CURRENTLY $20 A TON. AND ONLY THEN WOULD THE CITY RECEIVE ANY OF THE REVENUE. BOTTOM LINE, THE CITY SAID THIS ABOUT R.A.A.'S OPTION TWO, IT'S NOT COST EFFECTIVE, AND INSTEAD IT INCREASES THE CITY'S FIDUCIARY RISK AND ELIMINATES R.A.'S INCENTIVE TO MARKET THE COMMODITIES AGGRESS ENVIRONMENTALLY AND REDUCES THE LIKELIHOOD OF AN INCOME STREAM TO THE CITY, A COMPLETELY AGREE. AND YET MY COLLEAGUES ARE SUGGESTING WE SHOULD JUST, QUOTE, NEGOTIATE, WHATEVER THAT MEANS, A DEAL WITH R.A.A. WHY? BECAUSE WE LIKE R.A.A. AND IT ADDS 20 UNION JOBS. NEVER MIND THAT VIOLATES THE PRINCIPLE OF COMPETITIVE BIDDING AND MAKES A FARCE OUT OF THE PROCESS. AND AS FOR THE JOBS, I JUST REMIND YOU OF TWO THINGS. FIRST THAT THE CITY REQUIRES CONTRACTORS TO PAY A LIVING WAGE AND SECOND, OUR FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY IS TO PROVIDE THE COST EFFECTIVE, LOWEST RISK MANNER AND NOT TO CREATE JOBS. FOR ALL OF THESE REASONS I STRONGLY ENCOURAGE MY LEAGUES TO SUPPORT THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION ON CA-7 AND REJECT THE SUBSTITUTE. LASTLY, I HAVE TO SAY, I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE TONE OF R.A.A.'S PROTEST LETTER. I CAN UNDERSTAND BEING FRUSTRATED WITH LOSING BUSINESS, BUT THAT'S NOT A REASON TO SUGGEST CITY STAFF IS, QUOTE, BIASED,END QUOTE OR THAT STAFF SLANTED THE BIAS OR DECISION IN A CAPRICIOUS AND ARBITRARY PROCESS DESIGNED TO DISADVANTAGE R.A.A. END QUOTE. IT'S NOT EVER APPROPRIATE TO MAKE ACCUSATIONS LIKE THAT TO A PARTNER OR CUSTOMER LET ALONE TO A PARTNER THAT HAS BAILED YOU OUT IN THE PAST AND BENT OVER BACKWARDS WITH PRICE AND OTHER CONTRACT ADJUSTMENTS TO ACCOMPLISH YOUR NEEDS AND KEEP YOU AFLOAT. THE CITY DESERVES A WHOLE LOT MORE FROM R.A.A. THAN INSULTS AND ACCUSATIONS. MY COMPLIMENTS TO THE CITY STAFF FOR TAKING THE HIGH GROUND IN THEIR RESPONSE TO R.A.A.'S NASTY, ACCUSETORY LEVEL. MY COMMENTS AS WELL TO CITY STAFF FOR THE THOUGHTFUL ANALYSIS AND PERSPECIFICKIVE. CITY STAFF HAS QUITE APPROPRIATELY FOCUSED ON OUR FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY TO TAXPAYERS IN MAKING THE RECOMMENDATION. KNOWING THERE WOULD BE PUSHBACK AND THAT TAKES COURAGE AND I APPLAUD STAFF FOR THAT. THANK YOU.
01:00:48.666: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
01:00:51.902: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: AGAIN, JUST ON THIS -- THIS IS JUST ON THE AMENDMENT ITSELF, AND NOT ON THE MAIN MOTION?
01:00:58.843: >> Mayor Taylor: CORRECT.
01:00:59.410: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU.
01:01:03.581: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE AMENDMENT? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE. STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
01:01:12.923: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES.
01:01:17.762: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
01:01:18.262: >> Councilmember Eaton: YES.
01:01:18.863: >> Councilmember Nelson:  YES.
01:01:21.866: >> Councilmember Smith: YES.
01:01:22.466: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES.
01:01:24.435: >> Councilmember Hayner:  NO.
01:01:26.537: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES.
01:01:27.838: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES.
01:01:30.775: >> Concilmember Lumm: NO.
01:01:31.809: >> Councilmember Grand: YES.
01:01:32.409: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION CARRIES.
01:01:33.177: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MOTION AS AMENDED? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI AND THEN HAYNER.
01:01:40.084: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: WELL, I APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT'S BEING PUT INTO THIS. THERE SEEMS TO BE A LOT THAT HAPPENED BEFORE I JOINED COUNCIL. 40 YEARS OF IT AND SOME OF IT HAS BEEN A LITTLE CHOPPY. THERE ARE MANY THINGS TO THIS, AND THAT'S UNFORTUNATELY -- I VOTED FOR THE AMENDMENT, BUT TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, I WOULD RATHER HAVE THIS -- BOTH OF THOSE MEASURES STAND THEIR OWN AND TAKE CRITICISMS AND -- AND PRAISE FOR THEIR OWN REASONS. PUT FOR THE SAKE OF SAVING SOME TIME, WE ARE GOING TO DO IT THIS WAY. I UNDERSTAND MY COLLEAGUE'S POINT ON THE OTHER END OF HAVING A STRONG FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY TO THE TAXPAYER AND SPENDING THEIR MONEY THE WAY IT'S BEEN SPENT. BUT IT'S BEEN MADE CLEAR TO ME BY THE COMMUNITY, BY THE NUMEROUS EMAILS THAT WE HAVE BEEN RECEIVING THROUGHOUT OUR COMMUNITY, THAT THIS IS MORE THAN JUST TRYING TO FIND THE BEST COSTS, YOU KNOW. IT'S NOT LIKE GETTING ON AMAZON AND LOOKING FOR THE LOWEST PRICE. THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR WITH HAVING R.A.A. STAY A COMMUNITY PARTNER AND THE FACT THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE INVESTING IN OURSELVES. WE'RE LOOKING TO INVEST IN OUR SAOURSELVES HERE, AND LOOKING TO INVEST HERE LOCALLY, INCLUDING EDUCATION. I BROUGHT THAT UP BACK MONTHS AGO WHEN I FIRST SAW THE DIFFERING PATHS. SO THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF EDUCATION THAT IS REQUIRED. WE HAVE GOTTEN AWAY FROM A LOT OF THAT. I THINK WE GOT AWAY FROM IT YEARS AGO AND WHERE WE ARE AT TODAY IS BECAUSE OF A WHOLE BUNCH OF MISSTEPS, AND WE HAVE GOTTEN TO A PRETTY LOW POINT IN TERMS OF WHERE WE SHOULD BE. AND SO IT'S JUST A SELF- -- YOU KNOW, WE HAVE SELF-INDUCED OURSELVES TO FAILURE TO THIS POINT. AND IT'S TIME TO PICK OURSELVES BACK UP AND GET BACK TO WHERE WE NEED TO BE AS A COMMUNITY AND WE JUST, AGAIN, VOTED FOR A CLIMATE EMERGENCY A MONTH AGO. AND THIS JUST IS INCONSISTENT WITH SOME OF THE GOALS THAT WE HAVE WHEN IT COMES TO MAKING THAT GOAL MET. AND THERE IS MORE TO THIS THAN JUST DOLLARS AND CENTS. THERE'S A LOT OF INTANGIBLE BENEFITS WITH WORKING WITH R.A.A. THANK YOU.
01:04:25.549: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
01:04:26.517: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I JUST WANTED TO LET MY COLLEAGUES KNOW AND COUNCILMEMBER EATON AND SMITH THAT IT WAS ALL TOO EASY TO ARE ME TO VOTE NO TO THAT. I WAS LOCKED OUT OF THE CITY ACCESS FOR OVER A DAY. I HAVEN'T READ THE SUBSTITUTE RESOLUTION. I'M TRYING TO SHOULDER SURF TO SEE WHAT WAS SENT OUT. I THINK IT'S -- I THINK THE CONTRACT AND THE RFP PROCESS DESERVED A FAIR DISCUSSION WITHOUT SUBSTITUTING THIS. SO THAT'S THE OTHER REASON I VOTED NO. I MEAN, I SEE HOW EMTERRA HAS SOME REAL BENEFITS. I THINK IT'S APPALLING THAT WE ARE SHIPPING OUR RESOURCES -- OUR RECYCLING ANYWHERE AND HAVE BEEN FOR YEARS AND I KNOW THAT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE MARKETS. BUT, YOU KNOW YORK LIKE THAT. I DON'T LIKE -- I DON'T LIKE THAT. I DON'T LIKE SHIPPING STUFF ANYWHERE. IT'S GOOD TO HAVE INVEST IN OURSELVES. WHEN YOU HAVE A COMPANY LIKE ANTENNA. THEY HAVE R.A.A. MAY COME BACK TO US FOR CAPITAL IN THE MRF NEEDS TO BE REDONE EVERY FIVE YEARS AS PACKAGING CHANGES. WITH THE VOLATILITY OF THE MARKETS, RECYCLING MARKETS, THAT A COMPANY COMPANY MIGHT HAVE BETTER ACCESS THAN 'EM TERRA. AND WE MIGHT HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY THAT COMES WITH A LOCAL PROVIDER WHERE WE MIGHT BE REACHING OUT TO A BIGGER MARKET. EITHER WAY, I DON'T WANT TO KEEP SENDING OUR RECYCLING SOMEWHERE. THAT MAY BE ONE REASON WHY THEY DON'T WANT THAT TO BE IN-HOUSE. PUTTING THAT LOSS OUT AS A CONTRACT IS NOT REALLY THAT MUCH BETTER. THERE WERE PROS AND CONS WITH BOTH OF THESE RESPONSES TO THE RFP BUT IF ANYTHING, WE SHOULD REISSUE AN RFP WITH A FAIR BID, SAYING THIS IS WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR AND GIVE ALL-COMERS AN OPTION TO BID ON THAT.
01:06:25.903: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
01:06:27.137: >> Councilmember Grand: I APPRECIATE THE WORK FROM COUNCILMEMBERS SMITH AND EATON, AS WELL AS THE WORK FROM STAFF. I -- I DON'T THINK THAT OUR STAFF HAS BEEN TREATED COMPLETELY FAIRLY BY MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY. I THINK THEY WERE RESPONDING TO A PROCESS AND DID SO WITH PITYING RITTITY AND RAISED SOME IMPORTANT ISSUES THAT I THINK THE SUBSTITUTE RESOLUTION HELPS RESOLVE BY GOING BACK TO LOOK AT A CONTRACT. THEY RAISED SOME SAFETY ISSUES THAT I'M NOT COMPLETELY COMFORTABLE WITH THAT THE CURRENT PROPOSAL ADDRESSES. I THINK THAT'S A DISCUSSION THAT NEEDS TO CONTINUE TO HAPPEN. I THINK THAT THERE ARE, YOU KNOW, SOME ECONOMIC ISSUES THAT STAFF RAISED THAT I THINK ALSO DESERVE FURTHER DISCUSSION. SO I WANTED TO THANK STAFF AND I WANTED TO THANK R.A.A. AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S A LONG HISTORY OF CONTENTIOUSNESS AND I HOPE THAT YOU CAN TAKE SOME INSPIRATION FROM MS. WRIGHT AND TRY TO, YOU KNOW, WORK TOGETHER GOING FORWARD IF THIS -- IF THIS DOES PASS TO RESOLVE THESE ISSUES, BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I -- I THINK THERE'S IMPORTANT COMMUNITY CONTEXT ABOUT HAVING A LOCAL PROVIDER AND I JUST CAN'T WRAP MY HEAD AROUND THE IDEA OF SHIPPING, YOU KNOW, ALL OF THESE MATERIALS TO LANSING EVERY DAY. I THINK THAT EMTERRA, THEY HAVE WELL-DESERVE REPUTATION, IT LOOKS LIKE AND SEEMS TO HAVE SOME EXPERTISE HERE, BUT THE IDEA THAT WE SHOULD SHIP THIS TO LANSING, JUST DOESN'T SIT WELL WITH ME AND I THINK THAT THIS IS REASONABLE TO HELP WORK THROUGH A FEW OF THOSE ISSUES ABOUT ECONOMICS AND SAFETY AND THAT I HOPE THAT WE CAN ALL PASS THIS AND THEN COME BACK WITH SOMETHING THAT ADDRESSES THOSE ISSUES AND WHERE WE CAN MOVE FORWARD, BECAUSE THIS IS -- THIS HAS BEEN HEART BREAKEN TO WATCH US SHIP OUR RECYCLABLES OFF. IT'S FLIES IN THE FACE OF WHAT WE AS A COMMUNITY WANT AND WHAT THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY WANT. I WANT TO ADDRESS THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY THAT FOR YEARS HAVE BEEN RIGHTFULLY ON OUR CASE ABOUT THIS. I'M HOPING THAT TONIGHT WE TAKE A STEP TOWARDS REALLY FIXING THE MRF. WE HAVE BEEN HEARING THAT FROM THE COMMUNITY FOR YEARS AND I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THAT HAS BEEN COMING FROM THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION, FROM THE CONSTITUENTS, FROM PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY, AND I HOPE THIS WILL BE AN IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD.
01:09:00.691: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER EATON AND THEN LUMM.
01:09:02.626: >> Councilmember Eaton: THANK YOU. SO WE HAVEN'T HAD AN OPERATIONAL MRF SINCE 2016. AND THAT ALONE SHOULD CAUSE US EMBARRASSMENT OPERATIONALLY. WE HAVE BEEN SPENDING $100,000 OR SO A MONTH TO SHIP OUR MATERIALS TO CINCINNATI, OHIO. WHICH HAS BEEN BURNING THROUGH OUR SOLID WASTE SURPLUS. WHEN THIS RFP WAS FINALLY RELEASED IT GAVE BITTERS TWO OPTIONS. ONE WAS TO RESTORE OUR MRF OPERATION AND THE OTHER ONE WAS TO CONTINUE THE BUNDLE AND SHIP METHOD THAT WE HAVE BEEN USING OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. OWN ONE BID CAME IN TO REOPEN THE MRF AND THAT WAS RECYCLE ANN ARBOR. IN THE SCORING PROCESS USED TO EVALUATE THE DIFFERENT BIDS THAT CAME IN, IN RESPONSE TO THE RFP, ONLY 30% OF THE SCORE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH PRICE. AND SO LOOKING AT THE FIGURES IN THESE BIDS, I REALLY BELIEVE THAT R.A.A. CAME IN AT A LOWER PRICE, BUT BECAUSE SO LITTLE OF THE SCORE WAS BASED ON THE PRICE OF THE BIDS, THEY DIDN'T GET THE ADVANTAGE THAT A LOW PRICE SHOULD. A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM FOR ME IN THE SCORING OF THE BIDS WAS THAT IT DIDN'T INCLUDE THE CONSIDERATION OF THE CARBON OUTPUT OF SHIPPING THE MATERIALS TO A DISTANT LOCATION. THERE IS ONE CONSIDERATION. THE DISTANCE TO THE PRIMARY AND INTERIM PROCESSING SITES AND I SUPPOSE THAT'S A REFLECTION OF THE CARBON YOU GENERATE, HOW FAR YOU HAVE TO SHIP IT, BUT THAT WAS ONLY 10% OF THE PROPOSED WORK PLAN'S TOTAL SCORE, WHICH IS GIVEN 35% OF THE ENTIRE SCORE, WHICH MEANS THAT OUR CARBON CONSIDERATION WAS ONLY LIKE 3.5% OF THE TOTAL SCORE. WE HAVE MADE A COMMITMENT TO REDUCE OUR AS CARBON TO ZERO. THIS BID AS IT WAS RELEASED DOESN'T REALLY REFLECT THAT VALUE. BUT OVERALL, I BELIEVE THAT WE NEED A LOCAL MRF NOT JUST FOR THE MATERIALS THAT ANN ARBOR GENERATES BUT FOR THE AREA. OUR MRF IN THE PAST HAS HAD GREATER CAPACITY THAN THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR ALL BY ITSELF COULD SATISFY AND WE TOOK IN MATERIALS FROM OTHER COLLECTIONS. AND SO HAVING A MRF IN OUR REGION, ALLOWS OTHER COMMUNITIES TO USE THAT FACILITY. WITHOUT SHIPPING IT A LONG DISTANCE. THERE ARE SO MANY REASONS WHY WE SHOULD RESTORE THE INVESTMENT WE MUTT INTO THE ORIGINAL MRF AND HAVE A LOCAL OPERATION SO THAT NOT ONLY N ANN ARBOR, BUT SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES ARE NOT SHIPPING THEM OFF TO LANSING OR OTHER AREAS. I ALWAYS PREFERRED REOPENING THE MRF. WITH ONLY GOT ONE BID TO REOPEN THE MRF. AND I THINK WE SHOULD GRANT A CONTRACT TO THAT BIDDER FOR THAT PURPOSE. THANK YOU.
01:12:34.905: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
01:12:36.807: >> Councilmember Lumm: JUST A COUPLE OF QUICK POINTS SINCE THE ISSUE OF TRANSPORTING AND THE CARBON GENERATED HAS BEEN RAISED, IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION ABOUT THIS, AND MR. HUPY, I WAS GOING TO READE THE RE -- READ THE RESPONSE THAT STAFF PROVIDED, THE MULTIPHASE JOURNEY THAT RECOVERED MATERIALS TAKE BEFORE THEY GET TO THE MANUFACTURING OR REUSE STAGE.
01:13:03.300: >> YES, THE RESPONSE WAS THAT THE JOURNEY FROM THE MRF -- OR FROM THE WIN ON THE CURB SIDE HAS MANY LEGS AND PORTIONS OF IT. AND THE JOURNEY BETWEEN THE BIN AND THE MRF MAY BE THE SMALLER PART OF IT. I S USE AN EXAMPLE OF PAPER. MOST OF THE PAPER WOULD BE USED BY PRIVATE INDUSTRIES IN INDIANA. THE DISTANCE BETWEEN EACH OF THE MRFS I BELIEVE THAT IT IS NOT THAT BIG OF A DIFFERENCE WHETHER IT GOES TO SOUTHFIELD OR ANN ARBOR OR LANSING BEFORE IT GOES TO THE END USE. SO THE CARBON GENERATED IS NOT ONLY JUST THAT ONE PORTION THAT WE HAVE BEEN FOCUSING ON TONIGHT, BUT IT'S THE WHOLE JOURNEY. AND WHEN WE ASKED THAT QUESTION IN THE INTERVIEWS AS TO MARKETING TEAMS, EMTERRA MADE IT VERY PLAN AND CLEAR THAT THEY HAVE EIGHT PEOPLE FOCUSED ON MARKETING AND PART OF THINK MARKETING GOAL TO PLACE THE END USE AS CLOSE TO THE MRF THAT'S GENERATING IT AS POSSIBLE. AND WHEN WE ASKED THAT QUESTION OF R.A.A., WHAT WAS THEIR MARKETING STRATEGY, THEY HAD ONE PERSON PART-TIME DOING IT.
01:14:51.141: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I APPRECIATE YOUR CLARIFICATION AND HOW THE MATERIALS TRAVEL DIFFERENT DISTANCES UNDER BOTH PROPOSALS. AND THAT EMTERRA HAS FOLKED DEDICATED TO MARKETING AND MARKETING CLOSE TO THEIR LOCATION AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. THANKS. THAT'S IT FOR NOW. #.
01:15:15.131: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:15:15.999: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANKS. I JUST -- YOU KNOW, I HEARD THE CONCERN OF PACKAGING AND THE INCREASINGLY AMOUNT OF DIFFERENT MATERIALS ARE BEING USED TO PACKAGE ITEMS, AND I THINK THIS JUST HARKED TO THE FACT THAT WE NEED A LOCAL GET INDICATOR HERE TO EXPLAIN TO THE FOLKS IN OUR COMMUNITY WHAT WE SHOULD BE BUYING AND WHAT WE SHOULDN'T BE BUYING, REDUCING.
01:15:47.864: >> WE SHOULD BE REDUCING, NOT JUST REPSYCHING, BUT WITH THE DIFFERENT PARTNERS IN THE CITY, YOU WOULD PROBABLY HAVE MUCH BETTER EFFECT OF GETTING THE PRODUCT AND THE RECYCLING THAT YOU CAN REUSE AND YOU WILL HAVE THAT THAT LINK AND THAT EDUCATION AND I JUST THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, THE FURTHER YOU GO AWAY, THAT THE DIMMER THAT LIGHT GETS. I JUST WANTED TO RESPOND REAL QUICK TO THAT.
01:16:27.904: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
01:16:31.107: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WOULD LIKE TO THANK JANE FOR GETTING ME BACK ONLINE. THERE SHE IS HELPING JANE. THAT'S MUCH APPRECIATED.
01:16:39.883: >> I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THE FORMAT THAT THIS GAME TO ME IN. BE THAT AS IT MAY. IF I'M READING THIS CORRECTLY, WE ARE ASKING THEM TO NEGOTIATE A TEN-YEAR CONTRACT AND THE EMTERRA CORT WAS IS THERE A REASON WHY WE ARE ASKING FOR TEN YEARS S. THERE CAPITAL CONCERNS OR SOME OTHER COMMITMENT THAT WE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT? WHY TEN YEARS? I DON'T ANYBODY LIKE TO PUT THAT FORWARD? COUNCILMEMBER SMITH?
01:17:12.248: >> Councilmember Smith: I DID EXPLAIN THAT EARLIER IN MY INTRODUCTION, BUT IT IS TIED TO THE FINANCING THAT R.A.A. HAS TO INVEST IN THE EQUIPMENT AND THE MRF.
01:17:26.362: >> Councilmember Hayner:  IS THIS A SITUATION WHERE -- OBVIOUSLY, WE ARE SENDING OFF TO NEGOTIATE THIS CONTRACT, BUT YOU KNOW, I HAD CONCERNS IN THE PAST ABOUT THE UNUSUAL SITUATION THAT WAS POINTED OUT TO US, WHERE WE OWNED THE VEHICLES AND THEN WE CAN -- AND THEN BASICALLY WE PAY FOR AND RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING THOSE R.A.A. VEHICLES AND I DON'T WANT TO SEE US GET INTO THE SAME KIND OF THING WITH THE MRF. WHAT IS THE RISK MODEL GOING FORWARD? DO WE HAVE ANY SENSE OF WHAT THAT'S GOING TO BE?
01:18:03.466: >> City Admin. Lazarus: COUNCILF NEGOTIATING AGREEMENTS. WHEN I HAVE DONE THAT IN THE PAST, THE LONGER TERM AGREEMENT HELPS WITH THE CAPITAL RECOVERY AND GETTING FINANCING, BUT O. & M. RESPONSIBILITY, REPLACEMENT BEING SALVAGE VALUE THOSE ARE ALL THINGS THAT NEED TO BE NEGOTIATED IN THE DETAILS OF THE CONTRACT AND THERE'S STEPS TO TAKE FROM GOING FROM A PROPOSAL TO A CONTRACT. AND THAT MAY AFFECT THE PRICING, BASED UPON WHAT THE WEAR AND TEAR IS, HOW YOU NEED TO UPGRADE THE SYSTEM, OVER TIME, FOR CHANGES AND MATERIALS. THOSE ARE THINGS THAT HAVE TO COME OUT IN THAT STEP FROM GOING WHERE WE ARE WITH THE PROPOSAL TO A FINAL AGREEMENT.
01:18:51.147: >> Councilmember Hayner:  IS EVERYTHING THAT YOU INTO ED TO DO THIS IN A WAY THAT YOU FEEL PROTECTS THE INTEREST OF THE CITY AVAILABLE TO YOU IN THIS RESOLUTION? SINCE YOU ARE BEING CHARGED WITH IT?
01:19:11.301: >> City Admin. Lazarus: IF COUNCIL GOES DOWN THIS PATH, IT WILL BE A NOTION WHERE WE'LL NEED SUPPORT FROM COUNCIL, AS WE WORK ON BEHALF OF THE DIRECTION YOU GIVE US.
01:19:21.177: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU.
01:19:33.423: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
01:19:36.426: >> Councilmember Lumm: RECYCLE ANN ARBOR HAD AN UNDOE LIST ITED OFFER TO REINVESTMENT IN THE MRF AS A PROCESSING FACILITY IN EXCHANGE FOR A TEN-YEAR CONTRACT. AND THAT GENERATED A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT COMPETITIVE BIDDING AND THE CITY'S POLICIES FOR COM.TIVE BIDDING AND AT THE END OF THE DAY THAT REMAINED INTACT. AND THEN THE CITY DECLARES AS A RESULT OF ALL OF THAT CONVERSATION AT THAT TIME, THAT WE WOULD CONDUCT AN RFP FOR THE RECYCLABLES PROCESSING AND THE MRF OPERATIONS. HOW IS THIS DIFFERENT FROM THAT IN YOUR VIEW UNSOLICITED OFFER FOR A TEN-YEAR CONTRACT THAT WE SAID, NO, WE NEED TO COMPETITIVELY BID THIS. --
01:20:28.278: >> City Admin. Lazarus: WHEN RECYCLE ANN ARBOR BROUGHT THE UNSOLICITED PROPOSAL IN, I WENT THROUGH A DISCUSSION WITH THE CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE GOING THROUGH THE CITY CHARTER AND ORDINANCES AND IN THE END, IT CAME DOWN TO THE FIRST STEP AS YOU REMEMBER WAS MODIFYING WHAT THE BEST SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT WAS AND THEN IT WOULD REQUIRE REALLY A CERTIFICATION FROM ME THAT THAT UNSOLICITED PROPOSAL REPRESENTED THE BEST SOURCE.
01:21:01.844: >> Councilmember Lumm: AND YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO COMPETITIVELY BID.
01:21:05.682: >> City Admin. Lazarus: I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS SUFFICIENTLY DEVELOPED FOR THE CITY TO GO FORWARD WITHOUT COMPETITION.
01:21:15.325: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU FOR THAT COLLAR VIC. CLARIFICATION.IT'S BEEN MENTIONN YEARS AND THAT WAS FINANCIALLY MORE VIABLE FOR RECYCLE ANN ARBOR AND IT RELATES TO THE REPLACEMENT OF EQUIPMENT. THEY DID INDICATE THAT THAT WAS NOT FINANCIALLY FEASIBLE, RECYCLABLE ANN ARBOR DID. WHAT IS DIFFERENT UNDER THIS PROPOSAL? I'M TRYING TO WRAP MY BRAIN AROUND -- I MEAN YOU LOOKED AT THE EXISTING EQUIPMENT. YOU KNOW WHAT'S --
01:22:02.972: >> City Admin. Lazarus: SO GOING BACK TO JULY OF 2019, THE FIRST THING WHAT AS RECOMMENDED TO ME WAS WE SHUT DOWN THE MRF BECAUSE OF SAFETY ISSUES, PARTICULARLY A SERIOUS INJURY. THE CONDITION OF THE MRF HAD DETERIORATED BECAUSE THE THROUGH PUTT THAT WAS GOING THROUGH IT WAS SO GREAT. IN ORDER TO MAKE UP FOR THE REDUCTION OR THE COLLAPSE OF RECYCLABLES MARKET. SO THE CONCERN WAS THE EQUIPMENT SAFE TO OPERATE? WE MADE THE DETERMINATION THAT THE EQUIPMENT IN ITS STATE WAS NOT SAFE TO SEPARATE AND THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE DECISION TO PERFORM TRANSLOADING OPERATIONS AT THE SITE UNTIL WE COULD GET THROUGH THE DISCUSSION ABOUT A REASONABLE WASTE MANAGEMENT RESOURCE RECOVERY AUTHORITY, UNTIL WE COULD GET THROUGH THE SOLID WASTE RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PLAN AND THEN BRING THESE THINGS TOGETHER SO WE HAD ALIGNED ALL OF OUR CONTRACTS TO EXPIRE AT THE SAME TIME. I THINK WE ALL WOULD AGREE THAT THE PROCESS TOOK LONGER THAN ANY OF US WOULD HAVE WANTED TO DO IT. IT WAS DONE WITH THE DELIBERATENESS AND THE APPROPRIATENESS TO ACHIEVE THE BEST VAL F VALUE FOR THE CITY. THE RFP FOR MRF OPERATIONS WAS PUT OUT AND IT WAS RANDED SEPARATEDLY FROM THE SOLID WASTE RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PLAN BECAUSE IT'S A UNIQUE OPERATION. WE TRIES TO MAKE THAT OPEN TO EITHER REDEVELOPING THE MRF FOR CONTINUING THE USE AS A TRANSLOADING FACILITY AND THE TWO OFFERS WE GOT, ONE DID NOT ADDRESS REUSING THE EQUIPMENT. I THINK WE WILL HAVE TO HAVE A VERY POINTED VIEW HAVE A LOT OF SCRUTINY WHETHER IT CAN BE DONE SAFELY AND WHILE WE ARE DOING TRANSLOADING AND THE FACILITY IS REHABILITATED AND IMPROVEMENT TO THE BUILDING ITSELF THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE DONE TO DO THAT AS WELL. GOING WHERE WE ARE NOW WITH THE PROPOSAL AT HAND, IT WILL TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME. AND SOME NEGOTIATIONS IN GOOD FAITH AND IN GOOD SPIRITS.
01:24:18.741: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU.
01:24:23.312: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
01:24:24.213: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I HAVE A QUESTION, I THINK FOR MR. HUPY. I FEEL LIKE THERE'S A WHOLE LOT OF INFORMATION THAT I WAS ONLY ABLE TO SEE IN THE LAST 24 HOURS. SO I WAS ABLE TO LOOK AT THE REPORT FROM ALEXANDER INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES, THE REPORT ABOUT THE STATE OF THE MRF AND THE VARIOUS THINGS THAT WERE IN DISREPAIR AND I'M LOOKING NOW AT THE PROPOSAL FROM RECYCLE ANN ARBOR. THE LIST OF PLANNED EQUIPMENT ON PAGE 20 AND 21 AND I GUESS I'M CURIOUS HOW THAT -- I PRESUME THAT YOU MADE THE COMPARISON IN YOUR ASSESSMENT OF THEIR PROPOSAL. AND I DON'T HAVE THEM SIDE BY SIDE. I'M CURIOUS WHAT THE -- HOW THE PROPOSAL FROM RECYCLE ANN ARBOR AND THEIR LIST OF PROPOSED NEW EQUIPMENT COMPARE TO ALEXANDER INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES.
01:25:23.472: >> THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION, BUT I'M NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER IT. I WILL HAVE CHRIS SLATTEN COME UP AND GIVE YO A SHOT AT GIVINGU AN ANSWER.
01:25:39.021: >> GOOD EVENING. THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION, THIS WASN'T A DIRECT COMPARISON. TO THE RESULTS. IT WAS REALLY BASED OPEN THE INSTRUCTIONS THAT WERE PUT FORWARD IN RFP THAT STATED THE BALER, THE EXISTING BALERS AND THE FEED COMPONENT WERE THE ONLY PIECED OF EQUIPMENT VIEWED TO BE USED. IT WAS LAID OUT VERY CLEARLY IN THE RFP TO DO THAT BASED ON AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED, THE EVALUATIONS DONE BEFORE, AND THE CONCERNS WITH THE SAFETY STAFF. SO TO GO BACK TO -- THROUGH THE COMPARESON THAT STEP HAS NOT BEEN DONE BECAUSE OF THE CONCERN WITH THAT EQUIPMENT.
01:26:26.569: >> Councilmember Nelson: OKAY. ALL RIGHT. AT SISMENT WAS THE THEIR PARTY INDUSTRIAL -- THE ASSESSMENT OF THE THIRD PARTY ANDERSON WAS WITH THE SAFETY STAFF. THE REPORT FROM ALEXANDER LOOKED TO ME LEEK A SORT OF LAUNDRY LIST OF ALL OF THE THINGS THAT WERE BROKEN. AND THEN THE RFP JUST SORT OF IDENTIFIED A FEW THINGS THAT WERE SALVAGEABLE. IS THAT KIND OF WHAT YOU ARE SAYING?
01:26:53.596: >> THIS WAS THE ALEXANDER HAMILTON AND THEN ALSO THE C.P. MANUFACTURING WHICH WAS THE ACTUAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER THAT WAS ANOTHER EVALUATION THAT WAS DONE.
01:27:06.008: >> Councilmember Nelson:  OH, OKAY.
01:27:07.143: >> IT WAS MORE EXTENSIVE.
01:27:08.444: >> Councilmember Nelson: OKAY.
01:27:09.245: >> AND THROUGH THOSE MULTIPLES, HAMILTON, C.P., CITY SAFETY STAFF, AND THAT ALL LED TO THE DETERMINATION AND WHAT WAS LAID OUT IN THE RFP THAT ONLY THE ONE BALER AND ITS FEED CONVEYORS WERE TO BE SEEN AS USABLE AND THE OTHER EQUIPMENT WAS NOT.
01:27:32.468: >> Councilmember Nelson: OKAY. THANK YOU.
01:27:36.772: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. LAZARUS.
01:27:37.406: >> City Admin. Lazarus: TWO POINTS TO ADD. ONE THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS OF EVALUATING THE EQUIPMENT, I THINK WE ARE ALL AWARE OF EVERYONE'S DESIRE TO PUT THE FACILITY BACK IN OPERATION. AND IT WAS ONLY AFTER A LOT OF CONSIDERATION OF THE REPORTS THAT WE GOT AND EVALUATION THAT IT WAS NOT CAPABLE OF BEING OPERATED SAFELY. I WANT TO GO BACK TO THE COMMENT THAT WAS MADE ABOUT EDUCATION. WE DO HAVE SEPARATE AGREEMENTS WITH THE ECOLOGY CENTER TO DO EDUCATION. THIS ISSUE WILL COME UP AGAIN WHEN WE TALK ABOUT RESIDENTIAL COLLECTION. IT IS OUR INTENT TO KEEP THAT PROGRAM IN PLACE. IT WORKS VERY WELL. BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT PRICING OF AGREEMENTS AND GETTING BEST VALUE. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S APPLES-TO-APPLES COMPARISON SO OPERATING OUT THE EFFORT TO DO THAT NEEDS TO BE SOMETHING THAT WE CAN SEE AS OPPOSED TO IT BEING INCLUDED IN OTHER COSTS. SO I BRING THAT UP NOW, ONE, BECAUSE IT FORESHADOWS A LITTLE BIT THE CONVERSATION THAT COUNCIL IS GOING TO HAVE, BUT ALSO TO RECOGNIZE THAT EDUCATION IS A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF THE RECYCLING PROCESS. IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE THAT WE INMIZE CONTAMINATION, BUT ALSO REDUCE THE QUALITY OF WASTE.
01:28:57.953: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE. STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
01:29:02.958: >> Councilmember Nelson:  IS THIS THE MAIN MOTION?
01:29:04.260: >> Mayor Taylor: THIS IS ON THE MAIN MOTION AS AMENDED.
01:29:06.595: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES.
01:29:10.132: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
01:29:10.633: >> Councilmember Eaton: YES.
01:29:11.233: >> Councilmember Nelson:  YES.
01:29:13.135: >> Councilmember Smith: YES.
01:29:14.670: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES.
01:29:16.939: >> Councilmember Hayner:  NO.
01:29:17.540: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES.
01:29:20.042: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES.
01:29:23.345: >> Councilmember Lumm: NO.
01:29:24.046: >> Councilmember Grand: YES.
01:29:24.647: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION CARRIES.
01:29:26.482: >> Mayor Taylor: CA-11, RESOLUTION REGARDING THE MICHIGAN REGULATION AND TAXATION OF MARIJUANA ACT COMPETITIVE PROCESS FOR ADULT USE RETAILERS DESIGNATED CONSUMPTION ESTABLISHMENTS AND MICROBUSINESSES. MOVED BY RAMLAWI AND SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER. DISCUSSION OF CA-11. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
01:29:43.132: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: WHILE I SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION IN ITS CURRENT STATE, I DO DEFINITELY WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE CAPS THAT WE PLACED ON THESE BUSINESSES THAT ARE SELLING RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA. YESTERDAY WAS THE FIRST DAY THAT IT BECAME LEGAL IN THE STATE OF MICHIGAN TO DO SO AND YOU HAD THREE BUSINESSES HERE IN ANN ARBOR WHO QUALIFIED AND HAD THE LICENSE TO TELL RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA. ALL REPORTS INDICATE THAT IT WAS SUCCESSFUL AND THERE WERE LONG LINES AT ALL THREE PLACES. AND THIS RESOLUTION CALLED FOR A COMPETITIVE PROCESS TO BE PUT IN PLACE, OR AT LEAST ASK THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR TO DIRECT US TO WHEN THAT HAS TO HAPPEN. BECAUSE OF THE CAPS THAT WE HAVE ON THOSE. I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE A DISCUSSION ON THOSE CAPS AND WHETHER WE NEED TO HAVE THOSE CAPS REMOVED AND WHETHER WE WOULD NEED A COMPETITIVE PROCESS IF WE DID DO THAT. I THINK THERE'S A QUESTIONABLE FOUNDATION THERE, TO PICK WINNERS AND LOSERS, WHETHER WE HAVE. AND SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS TONIGHT, BUT I WILL CALL ON MY COLLEAGUES IN ADDRESSING THE UP FAIR ADVANTAGES THAT WERE GIVEN TO SOME BUSINESSES THAT ARE EXISTING TODAY AND SHUTTING OUT THE OTHERS. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S THE RIGHT WAY TO DO THIS. AND WE CAN TAKE IT SOMEWHERE ELSE OFFLINE AND I'M SURE THIS WILL BE MANY MORE DISCUSSIONS. I DO CALL ON TAKING OFF THE CAPS SO WE DON'T NEED A COMPETITIVE PROCESS.
01:31:48.791: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
01:31:53.228: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WANT TO AGREE WITH WHAT COUNCIL RAMLAWI SAID. I ALSO WANT TO MENTION THAT MARIJUANA IN ITSELF HAS A REPUTATION AND WE HAVE TO KEEP UP WITH THE LATEST RESEARCH. TODAY I TALKED TO MY DOCTOR AND THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, ONE OF THE LEA LEADING PAIN MANAGEMT PHYSICIANS IS NOW RECOMMENDING CBD EDIBLES FOR ARTHRITIS. SO THERE'S SO MANY BENEFITS AND WE CAN'T BE CLOUDED WITH THE NEGATIVITY SURROUNDED BY MARIJUANA BY SOME OF US. I CONTINUE TO HOPE WE MAKE PROGRESS IN THIS AREA. THANKS.
01:32:35.404: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
01:32:36.472: >> Councilmember Lumm: THIS IS A RESOLUTION REGARDING THE COMPETITIVE PROCESS, AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE RESOLUTION BUT THE -- THE RECOMMENDATION TONIGHT AS WE ALL KNOW IS NOT TO ADOPT A NEW PROCESS, WHICH DIFFERS FROM WHAT WE WERE TOLD WAS NECESSARY, WHEN THE RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA RULES WERE ADOPTED IN OCTOBER. ANN ARBOR'S RULES FOR MARIJUANA ESTABLISHMENTS AS NOTED BY COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI INCLUDES THE CAPS ON THE NUMBER OF RETAILERS, DESIGNATED CONSUMPTION FACILITIES AND MICRO BUSINESSES. AND GIVEN THAT WE HAD CAPS, THE THINKING HAD BEEN THAT SINCE THE STATE REQUIRES, YOU KNOW, QUOTE COMPETITIVE PROCESS, TO ALLOCATE PERMITS WHEN A MUNICIPALITY LIMITS THE NUMBER OF PERMITS ARE FIRST COME, FIRST SERVE APPROVE TO ALLOCATING PERMITS WOULD NEED TO BE REVISED. NOW WE ARE TOLD THAT THAT PROCESS IS NOT NECESSARY. WHY? BECAUSE THE STATE RULES ONLY REQUIRE COMPETITIVE PROCESS WHEN THERE ARE QUOTE COMPETING APPLICATIONS. AND THE WAY THE ANN ARBOR PROCESS WORKS THERE WILL NEVER BE, QUOTE, COMPETING APPLICATIONS. THE ANN ARBOR PROCESS REQUIRES SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE APPROVAL BY THE PLANNING COMMISSION BEFORE A PERMIT IS GRANTED. AND BECAUSE THE PLANNING COMMISSION DOESN'T GRANT PERMITS UNLESS ONE IS AVAILABLE, AND BY DEFINITION, THE CITY WILL NEVER BE IN A POSITION OF COMET POOHING APPLICATIONS. I'M NOT A LAWYER. I SUPPOSE THAT MAKES SENSE BUT I SUPPOSE IT LEGS ANOTHER QUESTION, WHICH IS SETTING ASIDE A TECHNICAL LEGAL INTERPRETATION OF THE STATE RULES. IS ANN ARBOR'S FIRST COME FIRST SERVE APPROACH THE OPTIMAL APPROACH? I'M LOOKING OVER AT OUR CITY'S ATTORNEYS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT WOULD BE ABOUT ERR, BUT IT JUST SEEMS THAT FIRST COME, FIRST SERVE ISN'T WHAT MOST FOLKS WOULD CONSIDER AN OPTIMAL APPROACH IN DETERMINING SOMETHING AS SUBSTANTIVE AS THE LOCATION AND THE QUALITY OF RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA ESTABLISHMENTS. I WANT TO MENTION THAT I'M PLANNING TO BRING BACK AND -- COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN AND I ARE GOING TO WORK ON THIS TOGETHER AN AMENDMENT TO THE MARIJUANA RULES REGARDING TO LOCATIONAL AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS. I BROUGHT THESE UP IN OCTOBER, AND IT WAS REJECTED AT THAT TIME, BUT SOME VOTED NO THEN, AND SAID THEY WOULD CONSIDER THEM LATER. I WILL BE BRINGING THAT UP. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN ON THE AMENDMENT.
01:35:27.075: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. WE NOW COME TO A SET OF PUBLIC HEARINGS. PUBLIC HEARINGS ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO SPEAK TO COUNCIL AND THE COMMUNITY ABOUT A SPECIFIC ITEM ON THE AGENDA. THAT IS THE SPECIFIC SUBJECT OF THAT PUBLIC HEARING. YOUR SPEECH MUST RELATE TO THE SUBJECT OF THE PUBLIC HEARING. SPEAKERS AT PUBLIC HEARINGS NEED NOT HAVE SIGNED UP IN ADVANCE. SPEAKERS HAVE THREE MINUTES IN WHICH TO SPEAK. PLEASE PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE TIME CLOCK. WE MAY ONLY HAVE ONE PERSON SPEAKING AT A TIME. IF YOU REQUIRE ASSISTANCE IN SPEAKING BEFORE COUNCIL TODAY, WE WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO PROVIDE IT TO YOU. PUBLIC HEARING NUMBER ONE. AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND SECTION 7.34 OF CHAPTER 77 (FEES AND BONDS REQUIRED) OF THE CODE OF THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. IS THERE ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING? KNEEING NO ONE, THIS -- SEEING NO ONE THIS PUBLIC HEARING IS CLOSED. PUBLIC HEARING NUMBER TWO. RESOLUTION TO APPROVE 212 SOUTH STATE STREET SITE PLAN AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT. IS THERE ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING?
01:36:43.886: >> COUNCILMEMBERS, MY NAME IS NEIL REAR DON WITH E.S.G. ARCHITECTS IN MINNEAPOLIS. WE ARE THE DESIGN TEAM WITH A GROUP OF OTHERS ON BEHALF OF C.A. VENTURES FOR THIS PROJECT AT 212 STATE STREET. I WILL DO A QUICK OVERVIEW AND OUR TEAM IS HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONQUESTIONS SHOULD YOU HA. WE ARE PROPOSING AN ANNEX USE BUILDING AT THE 212 STATE STREET SITE WHICH WILL BE ACCESSED FROM WASHINGTON STREET, VIA A MIDBLOCK WALKWAY. THE FIRST FLOOR OF THE BUILDING INCLUDES RELOCATED MICHIGAN THEATER RESTROOMS, AND EXPANDED RESTROOMS FROM THEIR CURRENT LOCATION CONDITION THE C CADILLC BUILDING AT 616. AND IT INCLUDES A RESIDENTIAL LOBBY AND FIVE DWELLING UNITS ABOVE THAT AND ADDITIONALLY IT INCLUDES A SMALL TRASH ROOM FOR HANDLING OF TRASH FROM OUR BUILDING, AS WELL AS FROM SOME ADJACENT PROPERTIES. AS I MENTIONED FIVE LEVELS OF DWELLING UNITS ABOVE WITH 19 UNITS IN TOTAL, AND WE HAVE WORKED THROUGH STAFF -- WITH STAFF FOR A NUMBER OF MONTHS AND THIS IS WITHIN THE STATE LIBERTY HISTORIC DISTRICTS. SO WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS A BUILDING THAT'S JUST BLENDING INTO THE BACKGROUND AND REALLY LOOKING TO BE COMPLIMENTARY OF THE HISTORIC DISTRICTS AND THE FRONTAGES THAT FACE LIBERTY AND STATE STREET. WITH THAT, I WILL LEAVE TIME FOR QUESTIONS, SHOULD YOU HAVE THEM LATER. I BELIEVE MY COLLEAGUE CHRIS IS GOING TO ADDRESS YOU NOW. THANK YOU.
01:38:16.778: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. JUST COME ON UP.
01:38:23.285: >> SURE, SOUNDS GOOD. GOOD EVENING. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. MY NAME IS CHRISTOPHER JOHNSON. I'M A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEVELOPMENT GROUP AT C.A. VENTURES, HERE WITH THE SUPPORT OF OUR PARTNERS AT CIRCUIT TROVEA. I WOULD LIKE TO GO OVER A FEW OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFITS THAT WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED IN THIS PROJECT AND A FEW OF THE PARTNERSHIPS OR COMMUNITY GROUPS THAT WE HAVE WORKED WITH. IN SUPPORT OF MAXIMIZING THE URBAN FABRIC BY THE LOCATION OF THIS BUILDING USING A PREVIOUSLY UNUSED PORTION OF THE MIDBLOCK, WE ARE PROVIDING IN THIS PARTICULAR BUILDING A LESSER COST CONSTRUCTION THAT BRINGS A UNIQUE OFFERING OF THE SMALLER UNITS TO REDUCED CHUNK. IT'S AN EFFORT TO REDUCE OVERALL LIVING COSTS WE ARE SEEING A 7 TO 8% REDUCTION IN SIZE AND 12 TO 13% REDUCTION IN RENT. REFUSE AND RECYCLING PLAN FOR THE SURROUNDING PROPERTIES AT THE REQUEST OF THE CITY AND THE D.D. AX AND REMOVING OF ON CYCLE CONTAMINANTS PREVIOUSLY EXISTING BUT NOW SHOULD BE REMOVED -- WILL BE REMOVED, EXCUSE ME. PUBLIC PARKLAND CONTRIBUTIONS IN THE AMOUNT OVER 11,000 NEARLY $12,000. A BENEFITS OF SCREENING THE MICHIGAN THEATER'S LARGE ROOF TOP MECHANICAL UNITS COMPLETELY FROM VIEW FROM THE STATE STREET BETWEEN THE LANE HALL AND THE SAVA BUILDING. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS THAT WE HAVE WORKED WITH VERY CLOSELY, THE D.D.A., BOTH WITH THE PARKING REFUSE AND RECYCLING, AND -- AND STREET ORGANIZATION, LOCAL MERCHANTS ON THAT CORNER, SPECIFICALLY THE STARBUCKS RESTAURANT THAT NOW HAS THEIR PICKUP OF TRASH ON THE SIDEWALK WILL HAVE AN ENCLOSED PLACE TO PICK THAT UP. THE MICHIGAN THEATER FOUNDATION TO WHICH THIS BUILDING WILL PROVIDE NEW CODE COMPLIANT REST ROOMS RIGHT OFF THEIR MAIN LOBBY TO PREVENT THE LONG PATH THAT TAKES IT NOW TO THE CAD WELCOME BUILDING. ALSO, I WOULD LIKE TO DISCUSS JUST REAL QUICKLY THE ADDITION THAT CAME OUT OF OUR WORK WITH THE PLANNING COMMISSION AND STAFF, WHICH ENDED UP ON THIS BUILDING TO BE ADDITIONAL SOLAR CELLS, SIMILAR TO THE AMOUNT OF 7700-KILOWATTS PER YEAR, KILOWATT HOURS PER YEAR, EXCUSE ME. I'M PROBABLY MISSTATING THAT SOMEWHERE. AND IF YOU HAVE ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS FOR ME, I WILL BE AVAILABLE. THANK YOU.
01:40:49.231: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WOULD WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING SOME. SEEING NO ONE, THIS PUBLIC HEARING IS CLOSED. PUBLIC HEARING NUMBER 3. RESOLUTION TO APPROVE 616 EAST WASHINGTON PLANNED PROJECT SITE PLAN AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT, AT 616 EAST WASHINGTON STREET.
01:41:11.820: >> MY NAME IS ETHEL POTTS AT 1939 JACKSON ROAD. WHEN THIS BUILDING 616 EAST WASHINGTON WAS ON THE PLANNING COMMISSION AGENDA, I POINTED OUT THAT THE STATE STREET CHARACTER AREA OVERLAY STANDARDS WERE NOT BEING APPLIED. AND I ASKED -- AND THERE WAS NO EXPLANATION AS TO WHY THEY WERE NOT APPLIED. THE CHARACTER AREA OVERLAY STANDARDS ARE STILL NOT BEING APPLIED TO THIS BUILDING. TO QUOTE THE U.D.C. ZONING CODE, QUOTE, THE INTENT IS THE PRESERVATION OF THE INTEGRITY OF THE OVERALL HISTORIC CHARACTER OF THE AREA. BE END OF QUOTE. END OF QUOTE. THIS NAMED HISTORIC AREA, INCLUDES FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH, FIRST METHODIST CHURCH, BOTH ON STATE STREET AND LANE HALL AND THE MICHIGAN THEATER ON LIBERTY. THIS PROPOSED 208-FOOT HIGH BUILDING WILL BE IN THE MIDDING OF THESE THREE AND FOUR-STORY HISTORIC BUILDINGS. CLEARLY THIS PROPOSED BUILDING DOES NOT REFLECT THE MASSING SCALE AND RESIGN OF THE HISTORIC CHARACTER OF THIS AREA. IT DOES NOT MEET STANDARDS THAT ARE WRITTEN INTO YOUR CODE. THESE SHOULD ALL BE CORRECTED FOR YOUR APPROVAL. ANOTHER ISSUE IS PARKING PROBLEMS ARE ALREADY SEVERE IN THIS AREA AND WILL ONLY GET WORSE WITH THE INADEQUATE AMOUNT OF PARKING BEING PROPOSED. EVEN NOW THE PUBLIC IS SHUT OUT OF THE WASHINGTON STREET PARKING STRUCTURE MUCH OF THE DAY. 616 EAST WASHINGTON MEANS MUCH LESS BUILDING HEIGHT AND MUCH MORE PARKING BEFORE YOU APPROVE IT. THIS BUILDING IS GOING TO BE WITH US A LONG TIME.
01:43:12.274: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
01:43:20.015: >> MY NAME IS VINCE CARUSO, I'M A BOARD MEMBER OF THE CARD GROUP AND A FORMER MEMBER OF THE -- I WORKED FOR THE SIERRA CLUB. I THINK THAT ANN ARBOR NE NEEDSO DO BETTER THAN JUST VERTICAL. I THINK THEY ISOLATE RESIDENTS, INCLUDING CHILDREN, WHO ARE NOT ENCOURAGED TO BE OUTSIDE AND INTERACT WITH THE COMMUNITY. WE USE -- ON THESE TALL BUILDINGS WE USE HIGH EMITTING CARBON CONCRETE STRUCTURES. WE NEED TO MOVE TO LAMINATED WOOD BEAMS. MICHIGAN HAS GREAT POTENTIAL FOR WOOD CONSTRUCTION. I THINK WE ARE UNFORTUNATELY SUBSIDIZING DEVELOPERS WHEN WE DESIGN THESE KINDS OF BUILDINGS WITH VERY MINIMAL PARKING COMPARED TO THE NUMBER OF RESIDENTS. A LOT OF THESE WILL BE STUDENTS, FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN WITH HIGH INCOMES AND PROBABLY MORE THAN ONE CAR. I THINK THE TALL BUILDININGS DEVALUE NEIGHBORHOODS AND STRESSES THE PARKING AND THE NEIGHBORHOODS THEY CAN'T FIND PARKING BECAUSE OF ALL THE PEOPLE COMING FROM THE BUILDINGS. THEY BLOCK SOME TALL BUILDINGS. MY SON LIVES IN NEW YORK CITY AND THEY HAVE A VERY POPULAR WEBSITE THAT ALLOWS YOU TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH SUN YOU WILL GET ON A CENTRAL APARTMENT BUILDING. THAT IS HAVING PEOPLE PAYING MUCH MORE FOR LESSER APARTMENT SO THEY CAN GET S SOME SUN LIGH. WE HAVE CANYON AND WIND TUNNEL EFFECTS THAT ARE VERY DETRIMENTAL. THE TALL BUILDINGS ARE INHERENTLY INEFFICIENT. IF WE ARE COOLING AND HEATING SYSTEMS AND POOR VENTILATION. NEW YORK CITY HAS ESTIMATED THAT ALMOST 70% OF THE EMISSIONS ARE FROM BUILDINGS, AFTER CAREFUL ANALYSIS AND SOME OF THE WORST ONES ARE VERY RECENTLY BUILT TALL BUILDINGS INCLUDING THE TRUMP TOWERS AND THE -- HIS SON-IN-LAW'S BUILDINGS. LEED CERTIFICATION DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN ENERGY EFFICIENT. THAT LEED STANDARD WAS ESTABLISHED BEFORE GLOBAL WARMING BECAME AN ISSUE. I THINK WE NEED TO START CONSIDERING LIMITING HEIGHTS ON BUILDINGS AND FORTUNATELY THERE'S DISCUSSION OF UNLIMITED HEIGHTS IN THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR, WHICH I THINK IS HARD TO BELIEVE THAT WE WOULD DO THAT. WE NEED TO CONSIDER WHAT THESE BUILDINGS ARE BEING PROVIDED FOR AND THESE ARE STUDENTS, BASICALLY WITH THE LARGEST ENROLLMENT. ENROLLMENT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN HAS EVER HAD. I THINK WE NEED TO WORK WITH THE UNIVERSITY TO DEAL WITH THAT. THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR CLEARLY SHOT DOWN A BUILDING THAT WAS 16 STORIES NEXT TO THE LIBRARY. I THINK THAT IS A GOOD INDICATION. THANK YOU.
01:46:22.897: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
01:46:26.201: >> HI, PHIL STOLL, 1414 BROADWAY. I WILL TRY TO BE BRIEF. WHAT IS THE MOST ICONIC SPOT IN ANN ARBOR? IS IT MICHIGAN STADIUM? NICHOLAS ARCADE? FARMER'S MARKET? KERRYTOWN AND SINGERMAN'S? ABLE IT HAS TO BE THE PROMENADE ALONG EAST LIBERTY. EVERY DAY HUNDREDS OF STUDENTS AND RESIDENTS ALIKE WALK DOWN EAST LIBERTY STREET TO STATE STREET TO MAIN STREET AND BACK, STOPPING AT THE MICHIGAN THEATER, DROPPING IN ON RESTAURANTS AND BARS. EVERY BUILDING ALONG THE STREET IS AT A HUMAN SCALE. THE STREET CUTS THROUGH THE VERY HEART OF THE CITY, UNITING TOWN AND GOWN. 616 EAST WASHINGTON PLANNED PROJECT SITE PLAN, I HAVE BEEN TOLD WOULD BE THE TALLEST BUILDING APPROVED IN THE LAST 50 YEARS AND I HAVE READ THAT IT LOOKS LIKE A GIANT CHEESE GRATER. IT WOULD LOOM OVER THE PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC AND WOULD DESTROY THE CHARM AND CHARACTER OF THE MOST ICONIC WALKWAY IN ANN ARBOR. AND IT WOULD OPEN THE FLOODGATE FOR MORE OVERLY TAU BUILDINGS ENTROCHE -- TALL BUILDINGS ENCOACHING ON THIS STREET. I GET GREAT ENJOYMENT WALKING AROUND DOWNTOWN, ON A PERSONAL NOTE, EVERY STREET CORNER REMINDS ME OF A GOOD TIME OR DISTANT ANN ARBOR HISTORY. I GET LITTLE ENJOYMENT WALKING PAST THE FOUNDRY LOFTS, THE VARSITY OR OTHER HIGH-RISES AND I SUSPECT FEW PEOPLE DO EITHER. WHAT I SEE IS VESTORS PARKING THEIR WEALTH IN ANN ARBOR AND RUNAWAY INEQUALITY. THE PETITIONER IS PROPOSING A 208-FOOT TALL BUILDING WHICH IS 28 FEET TALLER THAN IT IS PERMITTED BY THE D-1 ZONING DISTRICT, WHICH WOULD SET IT AT 180 FEET. PLEASE DO NOT APPROVE THIS PLANNED PROJECT SITE. PARTERSUPPORTERS HAVE SAID THAT9 REASONABLE UNITS IS GOOD ENOUGH. IT'S LIKE TRADING THE CITY SOUL FOR 19 APARTMENTS. I'M SYMPATHETIC FOR THE NEEDS FOR MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. INDEED, I'M CONCERNED THAT ONE OR MORE OF MY CHILDREN WILL NOT BE AI BELIEVE TO AFFORD A -- ABLE TO AFFORD HOUSING IN ANN ARBOR, LIKE NANCY AND I WERE. HOWEVER, AFFORDABLE HOUSING CAN BE BUILT FARTHER AWAY FROM DOWNTOWN.
01:48:51.279: >> SO YOU CAN'T DO RENT CONTROL IN MICHIGAN BUT YOU CAN DO SOMETHING TO HELP KEEP RENTS AND THAT IS ADD SUPPLY TO THE MARKET AND SO I'M ALL IN FAVOR OF THIS, I BELIEVE A LOT IN HAVING SPRAWL UPWARDS THAN OUTSIDE. I LIVED AT OUTSIDE OF THE ANN ARBOR AND I'M IN FAVOR OF BUILDING UP INSTEAD OF OUT. I'M TAKE OFFENSE TO THE IDEA THAT I -- SO I HAVE A FAMILY. I HAVE A WIFE AND A KID. I LIVE IN AN APARTMENT UP HIGH. I PAY OFFENSE TO THE IDEA THAT LIVING IN THAT ENVIRONMENT THERE, YOU KNOW, ISN'T GOOD FOR MY FAMILY, BECAUSE MY -- I'M ENGAGED. MY SON IS ENGAGED. SO THAT ARGUMENT, I THINK IS NOT VALID. BUT I'M ALL IN FAVOR OF THIS, IT'S GOOD TO BUILD THESE KIND OF THINGS. THERE'S ONLY -- SORRY TO PICK ON THIS. , BUT ONE OF THE THINGS I REMEMBER WITH THE LIBRARY LOT, WAS THE IDEA PEOPLE DIDN'T WANT A BIG BUILDING THERE AND THERE'S ONLY LIKE ONE OF THESE CONCRETE CENTRAL PARKS THAT YOU CAN MAKE. YOU CAN'T TRY TO PUSH FOR ANOTHER ONE IN THE CITY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. I'M SORRY TO INSULT YOU GUYS ON THAT. YOU CAN ONLY SAY NO SO MANY TIMES UNTIL PEOPLE SAY LET'S BUILD SOMETHING. LET'S BUILD SOMETHING. I'M ALL IN FAVOR OF THIS, MAKE IT LOOK NICE AND PRETTY, BUT OTHERWISE, I WANT SUPPLY BECAUSE IT WILL HELP -- SOMETIMES PEOPLE SAY IF YOU BUILD SOMETHING LIKE THAT, IT'S LUXURY APARTMENTS. I THINK THAT HELPED A WHILE AGO, WHEN SOME OF THE SKYSCRAPERS AND SOME OF THE APARTMENTS. THEY RAISED AROUND THE CITY AND THEY'RE LIKE, HEY, I CAN CHARGE MORE. BUT AS MORE AND MORE OF THESE UNITS -- THESE APARTMENTS GO UP, IT'S PUTTING PRESSURE ON THE MARKET, AS MORE SUPPLY IS COMING INTO THE MARK A MARKET AND IT'SG TO KEEP THE RATE AT WHICH THE RENTS GO UP. ANYWAY, THAT'S MY TWO CENTS. HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.
01:50:43.891: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
01:50:51.666: >> HI, JOAN LOWENSTIEN. I'M ON THE BOARD OF THE WASHTENAW HOUSING ALLIANCE. AT FORWTHE AFFORDABLE HOUSING SN IS HERE IS NOT A PERFECT SOLUTION. NOBODY HAS A PERFECT SOLUTION. NO CITY IN AMERICA HAS A PERFECT SOLUTION. THIS IS AN EXTEARMENT. WE ARE TRYING SOMETHING -- EXPERIMENT. WE ARE TRYING SOMETHING THAT'S DIFFERENT AND I URGE YOU TO ALLOW THIS EXPERIMENT TO GO THROUGH. I THINK THE PEOPLE WHO OPPOSED THIS HAVE BASED THEIR ARGUMENT NOT ON FACT BUT ON SOME KIND OF EMOTION. FOR EXAMPLE, THE WHOLE ISSUE OF PARKING, IF YOU LISTEN TO THE PREVIOUS DEVELOPERS WHO COME THROUGH HERE, FOR INSTANCE, THOSE -- BOTH OF THOSE BIG VILLAGE ON SOUTH U THAT DON'T HAVE PARKING, THEY HAVE SAID -- WELL, THEY HAVE HAD TO PURCHASE PARKING FROM -- OR LEASE PARKING FROM THE D.D.   AX AND THEY FOUD THAT NONE OF THEIR RESIDENTS WANTED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT. THEY TOLD US THE LANDMARK, WHICH WAS FIRST KIND OF HIGH RISE BUILDING THAT WENT UP ON SOUTH U, THEY DID BUILD A LOT OF PARKING UNDERNEATH AND ONLY ABOUT A THIRD OF IT IS FULL. BECAUSE OF THE STUDENTS WHO ARE COMING HERE, THEY MAY BE WEALTHY AND THEY MIGHT HAVE TWO CARS WHEREVER THEY LIVE BUT THEY ARE NOT BRINGING THEM TO CAMPUS. IN ADDITION, PEOPLE WHO MIGHT LIVE THERE WHO AREN'T STUDENTS, WILL LEARN IF PARKING IS REALLY EXPENSIVE OR REALLY DIFFICULT, THEY LEARN HOW TO GET AROUND WITHOUT A CAR. I CAME HERE BY BUS AND WALKED HERE. I WALKED BY THAT AREA AND IT CERTAINLY IS NICE ON A DARK NIGHT TO LOOK UP AND SEE TALL BUILDINGS WITH LIGHTS ON, AND THAT'S PART OF AN URBAN LANDSCAPE AND WE HAVE TO COME TO GRIPS WITH THE FACT THAT WE ARE AN URBAN AREA. THERE IS -- THERE IS CHARM IN ALL DIFFERENT PARTS OF ANN ARBOR. WE ARE LEARNING TO LIVE WITH A NEW KIND OF CHARM IN OUR DOWNTOWN, WHICH IS THE CHARM OF AN URBAN LANDSCAPE. THANKS.
01:53:00.928: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
01:53:06.467: >> GOOD EVENING. MY NAME IS KATHLEEN McDONALD. I'M A RESIDENT OF THE THIRD WARD. I'M A PROPERTY OWNER DOWNTOWN. I RUN A BUSINESS, JUST A BLOCK AWAY ON ANN STREET. AND I'M ON THE DOWNTOWN BIZ BOARD AND I'M MORE IMPORTANTLY FOR TONIGHT'S DISCUSSION, 616 EAST WASHINGTON, I'M THE LAY LEADER FOR FIRST UNITED METHODIST CHURCH. THE BOTTOM LINE IS WE WOULD NOT WICK A BUILDING THE SIZE AND THE MASS OF THE ONE GOING UP IF WE OWNED THE PROPERTY. WE DON'T. OKAY? THE DEVELOPERS HAVE WORKED VERY HARD TO WORK WITH US AS THEY PUT TOGETHER THIS PROPERTY PROPOSAL, AND, AGAIN, WE DON'T LOVE IT, BUT THE BOTTOM HINE LINE IS WE E WORKING WITH THEM TO REMEDIATE TWO CONCERNS WE HAVE, ONE OF WHICH IS THE IMPACT IT WILL HAVE ON ENERGY, AND OUR BUILDING AND THE IMPACT IT WILL HAVE ON THE LANDSCAPE. AND IN BOTH OF THESE AREAS, THE DEVELOPER, OKAY, HOWARD, I'M LOOKING HIM IN THE EYE AND WE TALK PERIODICALLY ABOUT THIS. HE HAS PROMISED TO WORK WITH US TO, AGAIN, REMEDIATE THE IMPACT IN BOTH OF THESE IMPORTANT AREAS. WHAT I COME TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT TONIGHT IS ANOTHER IMPORTANT AREA AND THAT'S PUBLIC SAFETY. OKAY? WE HAVE BOTH THE DEVELOPER AND FIRST UNITED METHODIST HAVE VERY LARGE CONCERNS, PARTICULARLY IN THE AREA OF PEDESTRIAN SAFETY DUE TO THE DEVELOPMENT AND IT'S NOT JUST THE DEVELOPMENT OF THAT BUILDING BUT THE IMPACT OF THE PARKING STRUCTURES VERSUS THE CONGREGATIONS IN THE OTHER STRUCTURES THAT HAVE GONE UP ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THAT STRUCTURE. THERE'S A LOT OF PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC. IT WILL ONLY INCREASE IN THE YEARS TO COME, PLUS MORE AND MORE DRIVEWAYS LEADING OUT ON TO WASHINGTON. WE WANT TO WORK CLOSELY WITH THE SAFETY FOLKS HERE WITHIN THE CITY COUNCIL, TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN REVIEW AND REVISE WHERE THOSE CROSSWALKS ARE AND THE NEED FOR ANY OTHER SAFETY MEASURES WE NEED TO PUT IN TO MAKE SURE THE NEXT DEATHS WE HAVE IN ANN ARBOR ARE NOT ON WASHINGTON. THANK YOU.
01:55:31.379: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
01:55:40.988: >> I WILL HIGHLIGHT A FEW OF THE SITE PLAN AND ARCHITECTURE. THE WASHINGTON STREET BOULEVARD IMPROVEMENTS, THIS PROJECT FIRST AND FOREMOST CREATING A HIGH QUALITY PUBLIC REALM. WE HAVE A LOT OF WASHINGTON STREET FRONTAGE WITH OUR LOBBY AND MAKING IT SAFE AND PLEASANT AND IMPROVING THE CHARACTERISTICS. A FEW OTHER THINGS. THE PARKING SPOTS IN THE BASEMENT LEVEL ACCESS FROM A GOOD BLOCK CONNECTION AND THEN THERE'S REALLY THE BUILDING IS CELT INTO PLACE WITH THE PODIUM TO MATCH CONTEXTUALLY WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH WAYNE HALL AND SOME OF THE OTHER MATERIALITY, AND THEN REALLY THE TOWERS IS LOOKING TO BE MODERN AND ELEGANT DESIGN WITH AN ICONIC MARQUEE AND CANOPY ON THE WASHINGTON SIDE, BUT IT'S LOOKING TO BE ICONIC STRUCTURE AT 19 STORIES. DWELLING UNITS ON LEVELS 5 THROUGH 19 WITH AMENITIES, SPACES, AT LEVELS -- A FEW AT LEVELS ONE AND THEN LEVELS 5 AND 18 WITH INDOOR AND OUTDOOR AMENITY SPACES. AGAIN, WE HAVE WORKED OVER THE COURSE OF A NUMBER OF MONTHS WITH CITY STAFF TO SHAPE THIS PROJECT IN A NUMBER OF WAYS, THAT'S WITHIN GREAT. AGAIN, WE ARE HERE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ON THIS ONE AS WELL, FOR CIVIL ENGINEER, THE DEVELOPMENT TEAM AND ANYONE ELSE, ANY OTHER QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU.
01:57:21.122: >> RUSS COLLINS 2585 HOLLYWOOD, AN IRONIC ADDRESS FROM ME, THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR THE MICHIGAN AND STATE THEATER. I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT KATHY AND JOAN, I THINK, EXPRESSED A VERY RELEVANT POINT IN REGARDING TO THE WAY THAT THE DEVELOPERS HAVE BOTH WORKED WITH THE COMMUNITY THAT SURROUNDS THIS DEVELOPMENT, AND A MORE OBJECTIVE VIEW IN TERMS OF THE IMPACT. I HAVE SAT THROUGH D.D.A. MEETINGS. I SAT THROUGH THE PLANNING COMMISSION MEETING, AND WE HAVE OBVIOUSLY DONE OUR OWN RESEARCH IN TERMS OF WHAT SOME OF THESE IMPACTS ARE. THERE'S NEVER A PERFECT DEVELOPMENT OF ANY KIND, BUT THIS GROUP OF FOLKS HAVE DONE A GENUINE JOB IN WORKING WITH THE NEIGHBORS TO MITIGATE WHAT MAY BE ISSUES AND TO SUPPORT THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED BY THE MICHIGAN THEATER FOUNDATION, AND I'M ALSO GLAD TO HEAR AND NOT SURPRISED THAT THEY HAVE WORKED WITH FIRST METHODIST CHURCH AS WELL. THANK YOU FOR LISTENING AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONTINUED AND ONGOING AND WONDERFUL DEDICATION TO OUR CITY BY SERVING ON COUNCIL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
01:58:36.730: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD HIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING?
01:58:43.470: >> YES, SIR. THANK YOU AGAIN. CHRIS JOHNSON. I WOULD LIKE TO JUST GO THROUGH ONE MORE TIME, AND DISCUSS THE BENEFITS THAT ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE 616 PROJECT IN OPPOSITION TO THE 212. THE BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PREMIUM THAT WE ARE SEEKING UNDER THE ORDINANCE, TALKS TO THE POINTS OF PROVIDING USABLE OPEN SPACE, EXCESSIVE BUILDING SETBACKS AESPECIALLILY ALONG THE FRONTAGE, WE ARE LOOKING AT BUILDINGS AND DEVELOPMENTS ON EITHER SIDE FOR THE STREETSCAPE. AND THE STORMWATER RUNOFF, PRESEVENNATION OF ARCHITECTURAL FEATURES AND THE BUILDINGS HAVE BEEN OFFERED FOR DOCUMENTATION AND PERHAPS RELOCATION, IF ANYONE WOULD SEE FIT TO DO THAT. AND THE SOLAR ORIENTATION, AND CONSERVING ENERGY DESIGN, WE ARE OFFERING TO MEET LEED SILVER SUSTAINABLE DESIGN. WE ARE ALSO -- WE ALSO HAVE WORKED WITH STAFF AT THEIR RECOMMENDATION AND AGAIN, INCREASED OUR AMOUNT OF SOLAR ON THE ROOF TOP OF 616, TO THE POINT WE WENT THROUGH ABOUT A THREE-WEEK REDESIGN OF ALL OF OUR TOP FLOOR UNITS TO REMOVE SOME CODE-REQUIRED SKYLIGHTS AT THE TIME, AND COME BACK AND PRESENT THAT WHICH DID BUY US ADDITIONAL SPACE AND I BELIEVE ANOTHER 5,000-KILOWATT HOURS ANNUALLY. AT LAST PUBLIC BENEFITS RELATE MORE TO, YOU KNOW, SORT OF THE CITING AND SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS. THE ON-SITE ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINANTS AND PEDESTRIAN-ORIENTED DESIGN AND THE MIDBLOCK CONNECTION BEING OFFERED THIS FROM WASHINGTON TO LIBERTY. THE REDUCED NEED FOR MOTOR VEHICLES, WITH THE PROXIMITY TO TRANSIT, THE BIKE AND OTHER MICROMOBILITY OPTIONS THAT WE WILL BE OFFERING, STORAGE. WE ARE OFFERING ON SITE THREE ELECTRIC SHARED VEHICLES. THESE WILL BE VEHICLES THAT ARE ELECTRIC CHARGED, REDUCING EMISSIONS AND ALLOW FOR THOSE RESIDENTS TO BE SHARED WITHIN THAT COMMUNITY. ADDITIONALLY, I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WE ARE LOOKING AT 19 UNITS. AFTER OUR VISIT WITH THE PLANNING COMMISSION, WE DID VOLUNTEER -- WELL, WE RESPONDED TO A REQUEST TO REDUCE SOME TO 60% SO WE HAVE TAKEN A THIRD OF THOSE. THESE ARE BOTH TWO BEDROOM AND ONE-BEDROOM UNITS, BOTH OF THEM MEETING ABOVE THE MINIMUM SQUARE FOOTAGE. TO GO THROUGH SOME OF THESE OTHERS THERE IS INCLUSIVE AND OPEN TOT  TO THE EN ENTIRE COMM, REFUSE AND RECYCLING TO CLEAN UP THE ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOOD, WE ARE BRINGING A LOT OF THAT TO THE 616 PROPERTY AS WELL. PUBLIC ART PROPOSED AT THE MIDBLOCK CONNECTION, THE ACTIVATION OF THE STREET FRONT WASHINGTON WITH OUTDOOR DINING AND COMMERCIAL RESTAURANT. AS WELL AS 300 TO 350 CONSTRUCTION JOBS AS WELL AS SOME OTHERS. SO THANK YOU.
02:01:54.628: >> BRAD MOORE ONE OF THE ARCHITECTS ON THE PROJECT. I WANTED TO BRING UP A COUPLE OF THE POINTS THAT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN MENTIONED. THIS BUILDING HAS BEEN DESIGNED SO THAT IT APPEALS TO THE BROADEST POSSIBLE MARKET SEGMENT. IT IS NOT HEAVILY LADEN WITH FOUR AND FIVE AND SIX-BEDROOM UNITS TO FOCUS SOLELY ON THE STUDENT MARKET. ONLY 20% OF THE UNITS ARE FOUR AND FIVE BEDROOM UNITS AND THE REST ARE STUDIOS AND ONES, TWOS AND THREES AND WE HOPE TO ENCOURAGE A MIXTURE OF TENANTS IN THE BUILDING. THE BICYCLE MARKING. WE ARE PROVIDING -- PARKING. WE ARE PROVIDING 246 BICYCLE PARKING THAT'S IN VIEW OF 106 REQUIREMENT. WE ARE MORE THAN DOUBLING THE ON SITE BICYCLE PARKING. ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO USE CARS LESS. THE THREE ON-SITE SHARED THAT VEIN. WE ARE HOPING THAT THE 15 UNITS OF LEASED PARKING FROM THE D.D.A., A SMALL PORTION OF OUR PARKING BECOMES UNNECESSARY OVER THE LONG H HAUL THAT PEOPLE WILL NOT NEED TO USE THOSE SPACES AND WE CAN ACCOMMODATE ALL THE REQUIRED PARKING FOR OUR TENANTS ON SITE. THIS IS A PUBLIC ART COMPONENT TO THE PROJECT WHICH HAS NOT BEEN MENTIONED BEFORE. IN THE MIDBLOCK CONNECTION, WHICH CONNECTS WASHINGTON STREET TO THE PROJECTS ON THE EAST SIDE, WE HAVE A PLACE FOR A PUBLIC MURAL. SO WE ARE INCORPORATING PUBLIC ART INTO THE PROJECT. WE ARE TAKING TRASH OFF THE STREETS. OUR 616 BUILDING HAS A HUGE FACILITY DEDICATED TO RECYCLING AND WASTE HANDLING WHICH IS GOING TO TAKE THE STUFF OFF THE STREETS AND OUT OF THE ALLEYS AND PUT IT IN A PROCESSING ROOM ON OUR PROJECT IN THE 616 PROJECT TO CLEAN UP THE STREETS. WE DON'T HAVE GARBAGE. WE DON'T HAVE RECYCLABLES BLOWING AROUND ON THE STREET. THAT WILL BE A GREAT BENEFIT TO THE AREA. THERE ARE LARGE PORTIONS OF CITY, WHICH HAVE BEEN RESERVED FOR NON-TALL STRUCTURES, IF YOU LOOK AT LIBERTY STREET AND STATE STREET AND OTHER AREAS IN THE TOWN, THAT HAVE BEEN DESIGNATED AS HISTORIC DISTRICTS, YOU CANNOT BUILD THE TALLISH TYPE OF BUILDINGS IN THOSE AND LIBERTY STRSTREET, THAT BLOCK IS ONE OF THEM. THE CITY HAS DESIGNED WHERE TALL IS NOT APPROPRIATE AND LEFT TALL FOR OTHER SPACES AND WE ARE ON ONE OF THOSE LOCATIONS. AND IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, WE WILL ALL BE HERE TO ANSWER THEM LATER ON. THANK YOU.
02:04:29.616: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING?
02:04:44.197: >> JOHN FLOYD, 519 SUNSET ROAD, ANN ARBOR, MICHIGAN. THE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO DO THIS ARE NOT DEVILS OR EVIL OR TERRIBLE PEOPLE. WHAT IS A PROBLEM IS THE MANIPULATION OF THE PUBLIC PROCESS. AND FOR THE PRIVATE BENEFIT OF A SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE, THE TEMPTATION TO REVIEW THE PROCESS OF HOW THE ZONING HAPPENED THAT MADE THIS PROJECT BUT IT'S NOT REVIEW THAT THE SMALL PUBLIC CORRUPTIONS AND THE DISHONESTY AND THE DISINGENUOUSNESS THAT LED US TO THIS TONIGHT. THI THINK THE MOST IMMEDIATE EXAMPLE IS THE E REFUSAL TO APPLY THE CHARACTER OVERLAY EXHIBITS. IT'S ALMOST AN EXAMPLE OF THE BANKRUPTCY OF THE PUBLIC PROCESS AS WAS TONIGHT'S MRF DISCUSSION. WHAT'S THE POINT OF HAVING PUBLIC PROCESS IF YOU ARE GOING TO THROW IT OUT IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE A PREDETERMINED OUTCOME? I DON'T HEAR OF ANYONE'S RENT GOING DOWN. I HEAR COMPLAINTS ABOUT THAT THERE IS NOT ENOUGH AFFORDABLE HOUSING. YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BUILD YOUR WAY OUT OF THIS BY USING THE MOST EXPENSIVE CONSTRUCTION TECHNIQUES POSSIBLE, BUILDING UP. THE PLACE TO BUILD, LOWER INCOME, MULTIFAMILY HOUSING IS OVER THE PARKING LOTS OF WEST GATE, MAPLE VILLAGE AND ASHON LAND. IN THE CASE OF WESTGATE AND MAPLE VILLAGE, THEY ARE NEAR A PARK AND MINUTES FROM ONTOWN ON PUBLIC TRANSIT AND THEY DON'T INTERFERE IN THE EXISTING RESIDENTIAL VIEW SCAPE AND THERE'S SHOPPING RIGHT THERE AND ALMOST ANY PLACE ELSE IN TOWN. THE IMPACT OF THE BUILDING ON THE AREA. THE BAPTIST CHURCH, NEXT DOOR TO THE METHODIST TURNED DOWN THE IDEA OF SOLAR PANELS ON THEIR FLAT ROOF, SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE OF THIS BUILDING AND WHAT IT WOULD DO TO SOLAR AVAILABILITY IN THE AREA. THAT'S NOT A SMALL THING. AND I HAD AN OCCASION TO SPEAK WITH RICHARD FLORIDA LAST SUMMER, THE GUY WHO PROPOSED TO BE PAIRED DOWN PARIS AND REBUILD IT SO MORE PEOPLE COULD ENJOY IT. SORT OF THE WILLIAM WESTMORELAND APPROACH TO URBAN DEVELOPMENT AND HE ACKNOWLEDGED HE'S WRONG AT WHAT MILLENNIALS ARE LOOKING FOR OR AGAIN Z OR WHOEVER IT IS NOW, ARE PLACES THAT HAVE ACTUAL CHARACTER AND HAVE HISTORIC DISTRICTS THAT'S WHAT DRAWS PEOPLE, WE ARE CANNIBALIZING OUR CULTURE, THE VERY THING THAT MAKES US ATTRACTIVE TO ACHIEVE SMALL-TERM PROFITS FOR A SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE. SO IT'S AN EMBARRASSMENT TO SEE WHAT THIS COUNCIL HAS DONE. WHAT YOUR PREDECESSORS HAVE DOPPLER RADAR, AND WHAT CERTAIN MEMBERS TONIGHT HAVE DONE. THE DISHONESTY AND THE DISINGENUOUS THAT I HAVE SEEN OVER THE YEARS SINCE IT'S PASSED.
02:07:45.345: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
02:07:45.946: >> GOOD NIGHT. YOU'RE WELCOME.
02:07:47.080: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING? SEEING NO ONE, THIS PUBLIC HEARING IS CLOSED.

MOVED AND SECONDED. COUNCILMEMBER SMITH.
02:21:19.125: >> Councilmember Smith: THIS COMES OUT OF THE COUNCIL POLICY AGENDA COMMITTEE. I WOULD SAY THERE WAS QUICK, UNANIMOUS SUPPORT FOR THIS RESOLUTION. I THINK IT REFLECTS OUR LONGSTANDING POLICY TO LIMIT CONCEAL CARRY AND EXPANSION OF THAT IN THIS STATE, AND, YOU KNOW, FOR A COMMITTEE WITH FIVE PRETTY DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT OUTLOOKS ON THINGS, I THOUGHT IT WAS PRETTY IMPRESSIVE THAT WE SO QUICKLY UNIFIED BEHIND THIS. SO THANK YOU.
02:21:55.661: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
02:21:57.697: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR AND THANKS TO MY COLLEAGUES ON THAT COMMITTEE FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD AND PUTTING IT IN FRONT OF US HERE TOTEABLE. THOSE OF WHITE HOUSE -- TO THE TABLE. THOSE OF US WHO ARE INTERESTED IN THIS THING, WE WERE WATCHING WITH HOAR ROW AS THE WEAKENING OF OUR CONCEAL CARRY LAWS IS WORKING THROUGH OUR STATE HOUSE AND SENATE, AND THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH LAWFUL CARRY. IT HAS TO DO WITH THE DRAMATIC WEAKENING THAT WE SEEN IN THE LAST TWO DECADES, ACCESS TO CONCEAL CARRY LICENSES, RENEWAL OF LICENSES. SOME OF THESE BILLS DRAMATICALLY REDUCE THE PENALTIES WHICH ARE SORT OF THE BEHAVIORAL INPUTS TO THIS PROCESS FROM FELONIES TO MISDEMEANORS TO LETTING YOU HANG ON TO YOUR LICENSE FOR 100 DAYS EVEN THOUGH YOU VIOLATED CARRY -- YOU KNOW, CARRY LOCATIONS AND SO ON. SOME OF THEM WOULD REMOVE THE ENDORSEMENT THAT YOU RECEIVE ON A CARRY LICENSE, THAT SOME FOLKS ARE ALLOWED TO CARRY IN CERTAIN PLACES LIKE BA BARS, ARENA,S AND CHURCHES AND ON SO ON. AND THAT WOULD REMOVE THE ENDORSEMENTS. I DON'T KNOW ANY BAR OWNERS THAT WANT OPEN CARRY OR CONCEAL CARRY IN THEIR FACILITIES. THESE ARE GENERALLY A BUNCH OF BAD LAWS COMING FROM OUR HOUSE AND SENATE AND LIKELY MAKE IT TO GOVERNOR WHITMER'S DESK. WE HOPE THAT THEY WILL NOT EXPAND AND LOOSEN THESE LAWS. ESPECIALLY IF WE TALK ABOUT FEDERAL RECIPROCITY AND CONCEAL CARRY RECIPROCITY. WE DON'T WANT TO BE THE WEAK STATE THAT EVERYONE COMES AND GETS THEIR LICENSE FROM AND THEN TAKES IT TO ANOTHER STATE. WE WANT TO BE A STATE THAT IS -- DEALS WITH THIS APPROPRIATE AND RECOGNIZES THE GRAVE DANGER THAT BRINGING A FIREARM IN A PUBLIC MMACE REPRESENTS. AND SO -- PLACE REPRESENTS AND THANK YOU FOR SUPPORTING THIS.
02:23:49.975: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
02:23:50.876: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, MAYOR TAYLOR. I APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT HAS BEEN PUT INTO THIS AND I WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A COSPONSOR IF I COULD.
02:23:57.850: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES]
02:24:02.021: >> Councilmember Bannister:  I WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A COSPONSOR.

THEY HAVE A DECEMB DECEMBER 11th MEETING, WHERE THEY CAN, IN FACT, HAVE THAT DISCUSSION.
02:24:44.764: >> Mayor Taylor: SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER SMITH? DISCUSSION OF THE POSTPONEMENT. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
02:24:51.103: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I APPRECIATE THE SPONSOR MOVING FOR THAT POSTPONEMENT. WE HAVE PUT IT ON THE AGENDA FOR THE DECEMBER 1 11th MEETING AND I THINK GENERALLY THERE WAS A SUPPORT THAT THIS PROCESS IS BEGINNING TO AND CONTINUE TO ACTIVATE THAT SPACE FOR PUBLIC USE GENERALLY, BUT THERE WERE SOME DETAILS THAT WE WANT TO GO OVER AND I APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT ON A TEMPORARY POSTPONEMENT.
02:25:16.495: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN. [CHFAVOR?[CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT IS POSTPONED TO THE NEXT MEETING.

02:25:37.950: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES, I WOULD LIKE TO REFER THIS TO TWO OF OUR ADVISORY COMMISSIONS, THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION AND THE DISABILITY COMMISSION AND JUST FOR CLARIFICATION, THE WHITE CANE LANGUAGE IS IN THE UNIFORM TRAFFIC CODE, WHICH IS LANGUAGE THAT'S WRITTEN BY THE STATE POLICE THAT LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES HAVE THE OPTION TO ADOPT WHEREAS THE MICHIGAN VEHICLE CODE IS STATE LAW AND SO IT WOULD STRENGTHEN THIS LANGUAGE. THANK YOU.
02:26:09.582: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE A SECOND TO THOSE REFERRALS? SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM. DISCUSSION? COUNCICOUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
02:26:18.657: >> Councilmember Lumm: I WOULD SAY THAT I THINK IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO ARGUE THAT STOPPING FOR -- FULLY FOR VISUALLY IMPAIRED PEDESTRIANS SHOULDN'T BE A MANDATORY REQUIREMENT STATEWIDE, AND AS COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD AND I APPRECIATE HER BRINGING THIS FORWARD, IT'S AN OPTIONAL REQUIREMENT BECAUSE IT'S IN THE TRAFFIC CODE. AND THAT -- THIS LOBBIES STATE GOVERNMENT TO MOVE TO THE VEHICLE CODE, WHERE IT WOULD BE MANDATORY AND I -- I UNDERSTAND WE ARE GOING TO BE REFERRING IT TO THESE OTHER COMMITTEES, BUT I SEE NO REASON WHY WE SHOULDN'T ADVOCATE FOR THAT CHANGE. THANK YOU.

02:28:07.666: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR AND THANK YOU FOR MEMBERS THE PUBLIC WHO SPOKE TONIGHT AND EMAIL CORRESPONDENCE THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS THROUGH THE HISTORIC DISTRICT COMMISSION, THE DESIGN REVIEW BOARD AND THE PLANNING COMMISSION AS WELL. BEFORE US TONIGHT ARE OUR TWO SITE PLANS, 212 STATE AND 616 WASHINGTON. 212 STATE SITTING WITHIN THE STATE STREET HISTORIC DISTRICT. THESE PLANS ARE INCREDIBLY INTERTWINED IN A LOT OF WAYS FROM THE PEDESTRIAN PASS AND ACTIVITY FROM STATE STREET TO WASHINGTON, TO THE SOLID WASTE PLANS AND FORM WATER PLANS. SO I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THEM TOGETHER, BECAUSE I THINK THEY NEED TO BE ADDRESSED IN THE SAME CONTEXT. I THINK 616 WASHINGTON LIKELY GIVES PEOPLE MORE PAUSE. IT'S A 19-STORY BUILDING THAT HOUSES 240 PROPOSED APARTMENTS, 117, 144 PARKING SPACES. 5,000 SQUARE FEET OF RETAIL. AND IT'S PROPOSED TO BE 15% HIGHER THAN OUR BY RIGHT HEIGHT ALLIANCE OF 180 FEET. TO GET THIS ADDITIONAL HEIGHT, THE PROPOSAL PUTS FORWARD A PLANNED PROJECT, AND THAT PLANNED PROJECT RECEIVES CERTAIN ALLOWANCES LIKE HEIGHT AND EXCHANGE FOR PUBLIC BENEFITS, IN THIS CASE THE PROPOSAL OFFERS 19 UNITS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING, THAT IT WOULD BE BUILT TO LEED SILVER STANDARDS, AND THEN IMPROVES CURRENT STORMWATER RUNOFF AND PATTERNS. REALLY THE NATURE OF THESE TWO PROJECTS IS TIGHTLY CONNECTED, I JUST WANTED TOISCUSS SOME OF THE CONTEXT OF THE PLANNING COMMISSION'S DISCUSSION, AND I'M PROUD THAT MY COLLEAGUES ON THE PLANNING COMMISSION WERE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE AND SECURE A FEW CHANGES BETWEEN ITS ORIGINAL ITERATION AND WHAT'S BEFORE ME. NAMELY THAT SIX OF THE AFFORDABLE UNITS WILL BE AFFORDABLE TO PEOPLE MAKING $36,000 OR BELOW, DOWN FROM THE $48,000 THAT IS IN OUR LEGACY REGULATIONS. THAT IT HAS BETWEEN THE TWO BUILDINGS INCROCED SOLAR PRODUCTION, 19%, AND THE NEW PROPOSAL. AND THAT THE DEVELOPER WILL BE CONTRIBUTING POTENTIALLY TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF A MIDBLOCK CROSSWALK, SHOULD WE APPROVE EACH. I KNOW STAFF IS HERE FOR QUESTIONS AS FOLKS HAVE THEM. I'M HAPPY TO SHARE ADDED CONTEXT FROM THE PLANNING COMMISSION DELIBERATION AND I'M CERTAINLY HAPPY TO HEAR COLLEAGUES AND RESPOND AS NECESSARY.
02:30:48.594: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
02:30:51.730: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I HAVE A QUESTION FOR STAFF, IF IT'S POSSIBLE. I PROBABLY HAVE MORE THAN ONE, BUT ONE FOR NOW. AND THAT REALLY PERTAINS TO THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP WHETHER ALL OF THE HISTORIC OVERLAY DISTRICTS, CHARACTER ISSUE DID STRICTS, WHETHER ALL OF THOSE -- DISTRICTS WHETHER ALL OF THOSE WERE APPLIED TO THESE TWO -- WE CAN TALK WITH THE FIRST, BUT YOU CAN ADDRESS BOTH OF THEM IF YOU WOULD LIKE. BUT WE NEED SOME REASSURANCES AS TO WHETHER ALL OF THOSE WERE LOOKED AT AND APPLIED.
02:31:28.934: >> MR. MAYOR, MY NAME IS JEFF CAAN, CHRIS CHANG IS WITH US AND THE DEVELOPER BROUGHT THEIR WHOLE TEAM AND WE WILL TRY TO ANSWER WHATEVER QUESTIONS YOU HAVE. WITH REGARD TO THE CHARACTER OVERLAY DISTRICT, THE SITE IS IN THE STATE STREET CHARACTER OVERLAY DISTRICT. LANGUAGE WITHIN -- WITHIN THE SPECIFIC PURPOSE STATEMENTS TALKS ABOUT PRESERVING HISTORIC CHARACTER. THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT. IT ALSO MENTIONS THE IMPORTANCE OF SUPPORTING TRADITIONAL COMMERCIAL STORE FRONTS, ALONG A SIDEWALK EDGE, WHICH THIS PARTICULAR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT PROPOSES. SO WITH REGARD TO THE HISTORIC CHARACTER, THAT -- A 19-STORY BUILDING ON THE EDGE OF AN HISTORIC DISTRICT MAY OR MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT WITH THE CHARACTER OF THAT HISTORIC DISTRICT. I DO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE BUILDING ITSELF IS THE 616 BUILDING IS NOT LINKING THE -- IS NOT WITHIN THE HISTORIC DISTRICT, THE 212 BUILDING IS. THE 616 BUILDING DOES MEET THE STANDARDS FOR SETBACK AND FOR THE STEP BACK. SO IN TERMS OF THE ACTUAL SPECIFIC STANDARDS RELATED TO THE OVERLAY -- THE OVERLAY DISTRICT, THE BUILDING DOES -- IN OUR -- IN OUR VIEW, MEET THAT. THE PLANNED PROJECT WAS NECESSARY FOR TWO REASONS. ONE TO ACCOMMODATE THE ADDITIONAL 28 FEET IN HEIGHT, AND SECONDLY TO ACCOMMODATE THE FACT THAT SOME OF THE BUILDINGS FRONT SETBA SETBACK WAS MONTH OD AWAY FROM THE WASHINGTON STREET SIDEWALK, IN ORDER TO PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR OUTDOOR CAFE SEATING, AS WELL AS A -- AN ALLEY CONNECTION THAT WOULD TAKE A PEDESTRIAN FROM WASHINGTON MIDBLOCK ALL THE WAY THROUGH TO LIBERTY. I WANTED TO PAUSE THIS TO SEE IF CHRIS CHANG WANTED TO ADD ANYTHING TO THAT.
02:33:46.505: >> YEP. CHRIS CHANG WITH THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT. I'M MOSTLY DEALING WITH THE 212 SOUTH STATE STREET AS JEFF HAS ALREADY ALLUDED TO. THAT IS IN THE HISTORIC DISTRICT. IT DID GO TO DESIGN REVIEW, ALSO THE HISTORIC DISTRICT. IT IS SETBACK. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH STATE STREET AND SAVA, BUT IT'S BEHIND SAVA'S AND SO IT WAS SOMEWHAT HIDDEN AND IT DIDN'T HAVE TO MEET THE PRIMARY SETBACKS SINCE IT WAS BACK THERE. I HAVE QUESTIONS OR ASSIST JEFF ON 616 EAST WASHINGTON.
02:34:22.040: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMAN RAMLAWI, YOU STILL HAVE THE FLOOR.
02:34:24.109: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I'M ALSO WONDERING HOW MANY UNITS OF HOUSING WE WILL DISPLACE WITH THE HOUSES THAT ARE CURRENTLY THERE AND HAVE BEEN THERE. I KNOW OF AT LEAST ONE BUSINESS THAT TOOK THE PREEMPTIVE MEASURE OF LEAVING. IN FACT, A TATTOO PARLOR. I KNOW THE OWNERS VERY WELL. THEY WERE NOT GOING TO WAIT AROUND FOR THEIR MARCHING ORDERS AND THEY PREEMPTIVELY LEFT TO GO TO A DIFFERENT, SAFER PART OF TIME. THIS IS THEIR THIRD OR FOURTH TIME MOVING BECAUSE OF DEVELOPMENT, THAT COMES THIS AND TAKES OVER WHERE THEY DO BUSINESS. I DO KNOW ANOTHER SMALL BUSINESS OWNER NOT FAR FROM THIS SITE WOULD HAS ALSO BEEN DISPLACED RECENTLY BECAUSE OF SPECULATION ON LAND VALUES AND THE AIR RIGHTS, THE VALUE THE AIR RIGHTS AND THAT PERSON HAS NOW LEFT THE AREA. SO BACK TO MY ORIGINAL QUESTION IS:  HOW MANY UNITS OF HOUSING WILL BE -- ARE THERE TODAY THAT WILL NOT BE THERE IF THIS IS CONSTRUCTED.
02:35:32.611: >> WHAT IS PROPOSED TO BE DEMOLISHED ARE FOUR HOMES THAT HAVE A NUMBER OF DWELLING UNITS IN EACH OF THEM, AS WELL AS WHEN WE ALL THE OLD CADILLAC BUILDING, WHICH USED TO BE THE OLD CADILLAC DEALERSHIP. I WILL LET THE PETITIONERS SPEAK SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE TOTAL NUMBER OF DWELLING UNITS LOST.
02:36:00.639: >> IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE HOMES HAVE BEEN CARVED UP TO VARYING DEGREES AND 11 HOUSING UNITS FROM EFFICIENCIES TO SIX BEDROOM UNITS IN THOSE FOUR RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS. THERE'S NO DWELLINGS IN THE COMMERCIAL BUILDING.
02:36:21.426: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  IF I UNDERSTAND YOU, THERE'S SIX UNITS --
02:36:24.796: >> Councilmember Hayner:  11.
02:36:26.031: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THERE COULD BE UP TO 40 OR SO?
02:36:29.167: >> YES, CORRECT. I DON'T HAVE A NUMBER ON THE OCCUPANTS. JUST THE UNIT COUNTS.
02:36:36.208: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. THAT'S IT FOR NOW.
02:36:40.879: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. HAYNER.
02:36:41.480: >> Councilmember Hayner:  ARE WE SPEAKING TO 212 FIRST? OR ARE WE LUMPING THEM TOGETHER?
02:36:49.654: >> Mayor Taylor: HOW DOES THE SPIRIT MOVE U?
02:36:52.157: >> Councilmember Hayner: WELL, THE SPIRIT MOVES ME BECAUSE OF WHAT RAMLAWI SAID, IF WE HAVE 40 OR 50 PEOPLE BEING DISPLACED AND THEN A CERTAIN SQUARE FOOTAGE OF MARKET RATE RETAIL OR COMMERCIAL SPACE, I DON'T -- I MEAN, I WILL SPEAK TO 212, WE WILL COME BACK TO 616. I AGREE WITH YOUR CONCERNS, ALI. I THINK THAT'S LEGITIMATE. I THINK AS WE ARE TRYING -- WE HEAR A LOT ABOUT SUPPLY AND DEMAND AND KEEP SORT OF A BALANCE SHEET OF HOUSING SUPPLY IN THE CITY, YOU MIGHT SAY OR A SPREADSHEET BUT IT'S REALLY A BALANCE SHEET. HOW MANY AND WHAT TYPE. AND FOR THAT TO BE ACCURATELY ACTED FOR, I THINK WE NEED TO REMOVE WHAT HAS BEEN REMOVED WITH WE PUT NEW BUILDINGS THERE. AND THAT NEEDS TO BE REMOVED -- THAT PART OF THE SUPPLY NEEDS TO BE REMOVED WITH ITS ATTRIBUTES, FROM THAT BALANCE SHEET, AND WE DON'T DO THAT AND I THINK WE NEED TO DO THAT WHEN WE CONSIDER THESE BUILDINGS AND ESPECIALLY WHEN WE CONSIDER WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL EXCEPTIONS TO THE EXISTING ZONING LAWS, WHETHER PLANNED PRODUCT MODIFICATION, OR ANY OTHER KIND OF EXEMPTION, OR THE SUGGESTION THAT THERE'S A COMMUNITY BENEFIT. I JUST THINK THAT WE'RE NOT DOING A GOOD JOB OF ACCOUNTING FOR THE TYPE AND THE NUMBER OF HOUSING UNITS IN THIS TOWN. AND IT MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR US AS POLICYMAKERS TO UNDERSTAND WHERE WE SIT. AND WHAT HAVE WE GAINED AND WHAT HAVE WE LOST? 212 IS  A BUILDING THAT IS NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART. I GO GRAFFITI REMOVAL. IT WAS A GRAFFITI DEN AND IT WAS A CLUB HOUSE, YOU MIGHT SAY FOR SOME ACTIVITIES THAT, YOU KNOW, HAPPEN IN THE URBAN ENVIRONMENT. I GUESS SOME OF THAT URBAN CHARM. AND, YOU KNOW, I WAS DISAPPOINTED HOW LONG IT SAT THERE OPEN TO THE ELEMENTS AND I GUESS IT WAS BECAUSE NOBODY KNEW IT WAS BACK THERE, EXCEPT THOSE WHO PROWL THE BACK ALLEYS OF DOWNTOWN ANN ARBOR. I'M DISAPPOINTED IN THAT, THAT IT SAT THERE SO LONG, AND IT GIVES ME CONCERN ABOUT THE STEWARDSHIP OF THESE PARCELS. ALSO IT WAS MENTIONED DURING THE PUBLIC COMMENT THAT THESE UNITS IN THIS 212 BUILDING WHICH WILL BE TUCKED BACK IN THERE INTO ISLY, ARE 12 TO 13% REPRESENT LOWER. I WASN'T SURE -- RENT LOWER. I WASN'T SURE. WOULD SOMEONE LIKE TO ADDRESS THAT? THAT THESE ARE MORE AFFORDABLE UNITS, 12 TO 13% LOWER THAN MARKET RATE.
02:39:31.049: >> FOR THOSE COMPARABLE IN THEIR SIZE, YES, SIR. IT'S A DIFFERENT CONSTRUCTION TYPE, BEING A WOOD FRAME, AND THEY ARE BUILT WITH AN EFFICIENCY AS WE ARE SEEING SIZE NEEDS TREND IN THAT DIRECTION, WHICH DOES ALLOW US TO LOOK AT AN OVERALL LOWER CHUNK RENT.
02:39:47.232: >> Councilmember Hayner:  SO THIS WOOD FRAME TYPE. THERE'S A -- IS THERE A SET -- THERE'S A SET HEIGHT LIMIT TO THAT TYPE OF CONSTRUCTION, IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY AND I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S ZONING CODE OR ENGINEERING METHOD.
02:39:59.811: >> YES, IT'S A SIX-STORY LIMIT. LIMITED BY THE INTERNATIONAL BUILDING CODE.
02:40:05.283: >> Councilmember Hayner:  SO THIS IS LIKE USING TIMBER --
02:40:11.856: >> IT'S STICK. IT'S ONE STORY CONCRETE PODIUM.
02:40:16.194: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU FOR CLARIFYING THAT.
02:40:19.998: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
02:40:22.434: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I FAILED TO REMEMBER TO ASK, HOW LONG WILL THESE HOUSING UNITS BE UNDER THE AFFORDABLE FORMULA?
02:40:33.244: >> PERMANENTLY.
02:40:33.645: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  IN PERPETUITY.
02:40:40.618: >> THERE'S 20 OCCUPANTS ALL TOGETHER IN THE FOUR HOUSES.
02:40:42.320: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: OKAY. THANK YOU.
02:40:44.989: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER?
02:40:47.358: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES.
02:40:50.762: >> Councilmember Bannister: EVERYONE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO READ THE AGENDA RESPONSES WE GOT THIS AFTERNOON, BUT SEVERAL COUNCILMEMBERS ASKED ABOUT WHAT -- HOW MANY AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS WOULD BE REQUIRED UNDER OUR BRAND NEW PREMIUM AFFORDABLE HOUSING PREMIUM AND THE ANSWER IS THAT INSTEAD OF THE 19 UNITS, SOME AT 80% A.M.I., UNDER OUR NEW REAMIUM PM ORDINANCE, IT WOULD BE CLOSER TO 70 -- 72 UNITS AND THEY WOULD BE AT OR BELOW 60% OF A.M.I., WHICH FOR A HOUSEHOLD OF TWO PEOPLE, THAT'S INCOME BELOW 48,600. SO I WANTED TO BRING THAT UP TO PEOPLE BECAUSE THERE WAS QUITE A BIG DIFFERENCES BETWEEN 19 AND 72 AFFORDABLE UNITS. AND I ALSO WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT IN THE AGENDA RESPONSES, WE -- THE AGREEMENT -- THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING -- THE HOUSING AFFORDABILITY AGREEMENT HAS NOT BEEN FINALIZED ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A TENANT'S INCOME INCREASES AND SO ONE EXAMPLE WOULD BE THAT THEY -- THE TENANT WOULD BE ASKED IN IDENTIFY ANOTHER UNIT IN THE BUILDING TO MOVE TO, BUT THERE'S SOME AMBIGUITY THIS AS TO HOW THE 19 OR 72 UNITS WOULD ALWAYS BE IN PLACE. YOU KNOW, WILL PEOPLE BE ASKED TO LEAVE THE BUILDING IF -- IF THERE AREN'T -- IF THERE IS -- IF THEY ALMOST EXCEED THE LIMIT? AND THERE'S ALSO QUESTIONS I HAVE RECEIVED FROM CONSTITUENTS TODAY ABOUT IF STUDENTS ARE SUPPORTED BY THE PARENTS, BUT THE STUDENT THEMSELVES APPEARS TO HAVE VERY LITTLE INCOME? YOU KNOW, SO ALL THE NOT YET FINALIZED HOUSING AFFORDABILITY AGREEMENT IS -- IS OF CONCERN AND THEN ALSO I JUST WANTED TO RAISE TO COUNCIL COLLEAGUES ABOUT WHAT -- WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ARE ABOUT THE 72 UNITS UNDER THE NEW PREMIUM ORDINANCE.
02:43:20.345: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
02:43:22.847: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER POINTING OUT THAT UNDER OUR NEW ORDINANCE, WHICH DOESN'T APPLY TO THIS BUILDING, SINCE THEY SUBMITTED THEIR SITE PLAN AND WERE APPROVED BY THE PLANNING COMMISSION PRIOR TO US PASSING THIS, THAT WE WOULD HAVE MORE UNITS AND I THANK COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN AND THE PLANNING COMMISSION FOR THAT. I THINK THE COUNCIL WAS RIGHT IN SUPPORTING THAT. BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR TO HOLD THIS PETITIONER TO A STANDARD THAT DIDN'T EXIST WHEN THEY SUBMITTED THE PLAN. THAT'S JUST -- I THINK THAT'S JUST ASKING IN BAD FAITH AND THAT WOULD BE WRONG FOR COUNCIL TO DO THAT. AND I DID JUST WANT TO ANSWER THE ACCOUNTING QUESTION THAT MY COLLEAGUES RAISED BECAUSE IT WAS 11 UNITS OF HOUSING. SO BY MY MATH IF WE APPROVED THESE TWO BUILDINGS WE GAIN 248 UNITS OF HOUSING, BECAUSE IT'S 259 MINUS 11. SO SEEMS LIKE, YOU KNOW, A REAL GAIN AND EVEN IF WE LOOKED AT THOSE 11 UNITS AS POTENTIALLY HAVING UNITS THAT WERE MORE AFFORDABLE WHEN I THINK YOU FACTOR IN THE FACT THAT WE GAINED 19 AFFORDABLE UNITS, THAT THAT MORE THAN BALANCES OUT THAT CONCERN.
02:44:37.055: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
02:44:40.558: >> Councilmember Lumm: JUST CLARIFICATION. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT BOTH 212 -- WE ARE TALKING ABOUT BOTH PROJECTS?
02:44:46.364: >> Mayor Taylor: EVENTUALLY WILL. THIS VOTE THAT WE WILL TAKE -- FIRST VOTE WE TAKE IS EXCLUSIVELY WITH RESPECT TO 212.
02:44:52.637: >> Councilmember Lumm: 212 IS WHAT'S BEFORE US, CORRECT?
02:44:55.807: >> Mayor Taylor: CORRECT.
02:44:56.374: >> Councilmember Lumm: I WILL POINT OUT -- I WILL WAIT, BUT WHEN I ASKED THE QUESTION ABOUT -- WITH THE RECENTLY ADOPTED RULES, YOU KNOW, WHAT WOULD BE REQUIRED AND WHAT WE WOULD GET IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF AFFORDABLE UNITS, I DID ACKNOWLEDGE THAT PROJECTS IN THE PIPELINE WERE GRANDFATHERED UNDER THE OLD AFFORDABLE HOUSING PREMIUM RULES. AND I WAS CURIOUS TO KNOW WHAT -- WERE IT NOT GRANDFATHERED IN. YES, IT WOULD GENERATE 72 AFFORDABLE UNITS WOULD BE REQUIRED AND THEY BE RESERVED FOR HOUSEHOLDS AT OR BELOW 60% A.M.I. I WILL WAIT TO COMMENT ON THE NEXT ONE.
02:45:52.363: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. ROLL CALL VOTE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
02:45:56.934: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES.
02:46:00.838: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
02:46:01.339: >> Councilmember Eaton: YES.
02:46:02.473: >> Councilmember Nelson:  YES.
02:46:04.142: >> Councilmember Smith: YES.
02:46:04.742: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES.
02:46:07.445: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES.
02:46:08.079: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES.
02:46:09.247: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES.
02:46:12.650: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES.
02:46:13.284: >> Councilmember Grand: YES.
02:46:13.885: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION CARRIES.
02:46:16.754: >> Mayor Taylor: DB-2, RESOLUTION TO APPROVE 616 EAST WASHINGTON PLANNED PROJECT SITE PLAN AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT, AT 616 EAST WASHINGTON STREET. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM. DISCUSSION OF DB-2? COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
02:46:31.903: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MAYOR. FOLLOWING THIS CLOSELY THROUGH THE PLANNING COMMISSION, AND NOW THROUGH THE PUBLIC PROCESS, I THINK THERE'S A FEW MAJOR HESITATIONS OR CONCERNS FROM RESIDENTS AND COLLEAGUES AND I WILL TAKE THEM IN ORDER AND TRY TO TALK THROUGH EACH OF THEM AND DISCUSS THE BENEFIT I SEE IN THIS PROJECT BECAUSE ULTIMATELY, I WILL BE SUPPORTING IT. I THINK THE FIRST CONCERN THAT I HAVE HEARD IS AROUND HEIGHT, RIGHT? IT'S THE LARGE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM. IT'S THE LARGE BUILDING THAT WE ARE DISCUSSING. THIS BUILDING IS PROPOSED TO BE 15% TALLER THAN THE BY RIGHT HEIGHT ALLOWANCE OF 180 FEET. AESTHETICS FOR A SUBJECT ENVIRONMENT SUBJECT. IF SOMEONE THINKS THINK IS TALL AND I UGLY, I CANNOT CONVINCE TM OTHERWISE. WHAT I CAN TALK ABOUT IS BUILDING MORE DENSELY IN OUR HOUSING MARKET. WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE DEMAND FAR EXCEEDS SUPPLY. IT'S DOCUMENTED THROUGH A LOT OF DIFFERENT STATISTICS AND DATA THAT WE CAN CITE. THE FACT THAT SINCE 2000, THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN HAS INCREASED ITS ENROLLMENT BY 10,000 NEW UNITS AND WE BUILT JUST BARELY OVER 6,000 NEW BEDROOMS OF HOUSING WHICH LEAVES A NET OF 4,000 NEW STUDENTS, THAT DON'T HAVE NEW HOUSING UNITS ATTACHED TO THEM. WHICH MEANS THAT THOSE STUDENTS CAN EITHER LIVE IN NEW DEVELOPMENTS THAT WE AHO ALLOW E CONSTRUCTED DOWNTOWN OR COMPETE WITH WORKING PEOPLE IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS FOR THE HOUSING THEY DEPEND UPON. FOR ME, I THINK THE ANSWER IS CLEAR. I WOULD RATHER PROVIDE HOUSING CLOSER TO CAMPUS, NEW HOUSING CLOSER TO CAMPUS, THAN PUSH STUDENTS OUT INTO OUR NEIGHBORHOODS TO COMPETE WITH FAMILIES TRYING TO PURCHASE SINGLE FAMILY HOMES, WITH WORKING RENDERS TRYING TO LIVE CLOSE TO -- RENTERS TRYING TO LIVE CLOSE TO WHERE THEY WORK OR POTENTIALLY EVEN INCREASE THE DEMAND FOR NEW AND VERY PROBLEMATIC TYPES OF DEVELOPMENT LIKE THE COTTAGES THE BARTON GREEN, WHERE STUDENTS INSTEAD OF BEING HOUSED IN DENSE DEVELOPMENTS NEAR CAMPUS, ARE HOUSED IN SPRAWLING DEVELOPMENTS FAR OUTSIDE THE CAMPUS. THE SECOND THAT I HAVE HEARD COMMUNICATED WAS THE SHADOWS, AS WELL AS TO HEIGHT. I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE INCREASE OF 15% HEIGHT DOESN'T ACTUALLY FUNCTIONALLY IMPACT THE AMOUNT OF SHADOWS CAST ON FIRST UNITED METHODIST BUT A BY RIGHT DEVELOPMENT WOULD. THE MARGINAL INCREASE IS REALLY NOMINAL, NONEXISTENT. I ALSO WAS REALLY RELIEVED TO HEAR A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE CHURCH SPEAK TO THE -- TO HOW WELL THE DEVELOPER HAS BEEN WORKING WITH THEM AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN ECHOED THROUGH THE PUBLIC PROCESS AS YOU LOOK THROUGH THE MINUTES AS WELL. I'M REALLY APPRECIATIVE OF THAT. THEY WILL BE HELPING TO FUND REPLANTING PLANTS THAT WILL THRIVE IN THE NEW ENVIRONMENT. AND THEN THE THIRD I HAVE HEARD IS AROUND THE PLANNED PROJECT. THERE'S A GROUP THAT'S SUED THE CITY, CLAIMING THAT THE MICHIGAN ZONING ENABLING ACT DOESN'T ALLOW FOR ADDITIONAL HEIGHT LIKE THE HEIGHT THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW. AND THAT LAWSUIT REFERENCE VARIANCES AND VARIANCES AND PLANNED PROJECTS ARE INHERENTLY DIFFERENT. THEY ARE TWO VERY, VERY DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS AND LEGAL MECHANISMS. VARIANCES ALLOW FOR SOMEONE TO WORK OUTSIDE OF OUR ZONING CODE, BECAUSE THERE'S SOME HARDSHIP THAT THEIR PROPERTY PRESENTS. A PLANNED PROJECT SAYS THAT SOMEONE GETS A LITTLE BIT MORE OF SOMETHING OR A LITTLE BIT OF LEEWAY IN ONE REGULATION IN EXCHANGE FOR A PUBLIC BENEFIT AND UNDER OUR PLANNED PROJECT REGULATIONS THERE ARE ABOUT EIGHT CRITERIA AND THE DEVELOPER ONLY HAS TO MEET ONE OF THOSE EIGHT IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE A PLANNED PROJECT. THIS PROPOSAL ACHIEVED A NUMBER AND I HAVE SPOKEN TO THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING, THE SOLAR CAPACITY, AND THE LEED SILVER CERTIFICATION -- NOT CERTIFICATION, BUT THE LEED SILVER STANDARDS AND THE PEDESTRIAN ACCESS BETWEEN STATE STREET AND WASHINGTON. THESE THREE JUSTIFY THE PLANNED PROJECT AND THOSE PLANNED PROJECT REGULATIONS IN THE ZONING CODE HAVE BEEN IN PLACE FOR OVER 20 YEARS AND EXISTING ZONING CODES IN COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE OF MICHIGAN. WE'RE NOT UNIQUE IN ANY WAY WHATSOEVER. THEN THE ONE THAT I HAVE HEARD, ACTUALLY FOR THE FIRST TIME AT THIS TABLE WAS CONCERNED AROUND THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND I APPRECIATE THAT. AS SOMEONE WHO ANCHORED MY TENURE ON COUNSEL US IS ON TRYING TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR WORKING FOLKS IN THIS TOWN, I APPRECIATE THAT CONCERN. THE FIRST WAS AROUND WHAT ARE WE DISPLACING? AND I HEARD 20 PEOPLE, SIX BUILDINGS. I LOOKED THE RENTS FOR ONE OF THE BUILDINGS ON EACH WASHINGTON. AND ONE OF HOUSES IS REQUESTING SECURITY DEPOSIT THAT IF YOU ASSUME SOMEONE IS PAYING 150% OF THEIR RENT FOR THE SE SECURITY DEPARTMENT, WHICH THE STANDARD OF LANDLORDS, YOU CAN SAY THAT THE TENANT IS SPENDING 1100 TO $1,300 A MONTH ON RENT. WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT DISPLACING PEOPLE WHO HAVE AFFORDABLE HOUSING NOW TO GIVE WAY FOR A GENTRIFIER. THE SUPPLY IS SO ASTRONOMICALLY HIGH RELATIVE TO THE SUPPLY OF HOUSING. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT WE PLACING THE HOUSING OF 20 LIKELY STUDENTS WHO TURN OVER EVERY YEAR, AND ARE PLACING THAT HOUSING WITH AN ADDITIONAL 259 UNITS OF HOUSING, THAT WILL HAVE COMPARABLE RENTS, AND GUARANTEE RENTS AT THAT SAME PRICE POINT FOR EVEN MORE OF THE UNITS. SO I KNOW I'M AT TIME, I WILL LEAVE IT THERE AND I WILL TRY NOT TO SPEAK A SECOND TIME.
02:52:12.176: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
02:52:13.811: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. SO LIKE MANY OF YOU, I PROBABLY RECEIVED A LOT OF CORRESPONDENCE FROM FOLKS WHO WERE UNHAPPY WITH THIS FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER, AND I'M NOT THEY W THRILLED BY . THIS IS WHAT WE ARE SEEING WHEN WE CREATED ALL OF THIS BUILDING SQUARE FOOTAGE POTENTIAL WITH THIS D-1, D-2 ZONING AND WHEN THAT FILLS IN, IT BECOMES MORE OF A SQUARE AND A PLANNED VIEW, IT BECOMES THREE-DIMENSIONAL AND WE SEE THE ENVIRONMENT THAT WE'RE CREATING. AND NOT EVERYBODY LOVES, AND I APPRECIATE THAT. AND, YOU KNOW, SHH PEOPLE -- SOME PEOPLE WANT TO SPEAK TO THAT. AND WHEN WE -- WHEN WE TALK ABOUT DEMAND, FOR HOUSE, I MEAN, I THINK THAT OUR DEMAND -- I'M NOT AN ECONOMIST. I KNOW KAI IS OUT HERE SOMEWHERE. I THINK OUR DEMAND IS CHARACTERIZED AS INELASTIC. IT SEEMS LIKE PRICE DOESN'T REALLY PLAY A ROLE IN PEOPLE WANTING TO MOVE TO ANN ARBOR AND NEEDING A PLACE TO LIVE, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PUSH OF THE UNIVERSITY AND ALL OF THE RESEARCH JOBS AND STUDENT ENROLLMENT AND GOING UP AND SO ON. I THINK THAT CREATES AN INELASTIC DEMAND. I DON'T THINK WE WILL EVER REALLY SUPPLY ENOUGH TO SEE PRICES LOWER -- LOWER ON THEIR OWN AND, IN FACT, IT HASN'T AND THAT INCLUDES THE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF UNITS BEING BUILT IN THE TOWNSHIPS IN THE GREATER ANN ARBOR AREA. SO WE ACT LIKE WE EXIST IN A VACUUM HERE, IT'S JUST THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR INSIDE THE PROPERTY -- OR THE FREEWAY RINGS BUT, OF COURSE, IT'S NOT. AND SO WHEN WE INCLUDE ALL OF THAT BUILDING, WE HAVEN'T SEEN PRICES GO DOWN ANYWHERE. I'M JUST NOT BUYING THE SUPPLY AND THE DEMAND ARGUMENT WHEN IT COMES TO HOUSING IN ANN ARBOR. IT'S NOT A FREE MARKET. IT'S A MARKET THAT HAS GREAT MARKET PRESSURES ESPECIALLY BROUGHT ON BY THE UNIVERSITY AND THEIR WILLINGNESS TO PAY A FAIR WAGE AND EXPAND THEIR OPERATIONS HERE. YOU KNOW, IT COMES TO DECIDING ON OTHER THINGS. NOW, WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THIS 19 VERSUS 27 UNITS IN 616, IT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE THAT WE -- AND I DON'T BELIEVE I SUPPORTED THIS NOTION, BUT I CAN'T RECALL. IF -- THAT -- UNDER OUR NEW REGULATIONS WHICH I DO SUPPORT, WHEN WE GOT RID OF THE RESIDENTIAL PREMIUM, WE PUT IN THIS AFFORDABLE HOUSING PREMIUM AND THIS IS ONE OF THE PUBLIC SPEAKERS REFERRED TO THIS AS THIS GREAT EXPERIMENT BEING UNDERWAY. BUT THIS ISN'T -- THIS BUILDING IS NOT PARTICIPATING IN THAT EXPERIMENT, BECAUSE WE EXCLUDED IT SPECIFICALLY WHEN WE BROUGHT THE MOTION A COUPLE OF MEETINGS AGO. THIS IS SLIPPED IN UNDER THE WIRE OF THAT EXPERIMENT AS IT WERE. SO PEOPLE OUT THIS IN THE PUBLIC SHOULD KNOW THAT THE GOAL OF THAT, WHICH I FULLY SUPPORTED COUNCILMAN ACKERMAN AND I APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THAT FORWARD, THAT THIS BUILDING BUILT UNDER THE NEW RULES WOULD HAVE 72 UNITS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING, THIS BIDDING BUILT AS IT STANDS BEFORE US TODAY WILL HAVE 19 AND, YES, WE EXCLUDED THEM FROM THAT. WELL, YOU KNOW, MAYBE SHAME ON US OR MAYBE THAT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO FROM A LEGAL PERSPECTIVE, BUT PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW THAT. THAT'S THE CHANGES WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE HERE. AND THIS AMOUNT OF SQUARE FOOTAGE ON THAT PLANNED VIEW IS NOT GOING TO MEET THOSE CHANGES. NOW, I DON'T KNOW IF -- HOW TALL THEY WOULD LIKE TO BUILD THIS TO GET THE 60 SOME UNITS UP IN THERE. BUT WHAT IS A FIRST WARD REPRESENTATIVE, WHAT REALLY CONCERNS ME IS THAT -- WELL, THIS SLIPPED UNDER THE ENVIRONMENT OF THAT GREAT EXPERIMENT THAT WE ARE HOPING THAT OTHER PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT WILL HELP US MOVE FORWARD TO FIND MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THESE DOWNTOWN ZONING DISTRICTS, IS -- IT'S AN ANALOGY OF WHAT HAPPENS OVER IN LOWERTOWN, WHERE THE SAME BUILT STRUCTURE WOULD HAVE PROVIDED MUCH MORE BENEFIT THAN WE ALLOWED IT TO HAPPEN AT THIS TABLE. WHEN THEY WENT FROM A PUD TO C1A-4, THEY DIDN'T MAKE THE $9 MILLION DONATION TO THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND LETTING THIS ONE GO BY, WE ARE ESSENTIALLY SAYING, WELL, WE ARE OKAY WITH ONE LESS OPPORTUNITY TO MEET OUR OWN CITY GOALS AND I JUST GENERALLY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT. I KNOW IT'S NOT A B BY RIGHT DEVELOPMENT. AND COUNCILMAN ACKERMAN DISCUSSED WHY IT DOES MEET THIS REQUIREMENT. WE ARE NOT REQUIRED TO APPROVE IT. AND ONE LAST QUICK THING, WE TALKED ABOUT HEIGHT NOT BEING APPROPRIATE. WELL, JUST TO BE FRANK, AS A LIFETIME -- ESSENTIALLY A LIFETIME ANN ARBOR RESIDENT THAT SHIP SAILED WHEN WE LET THE D.D. D.D.A. BUILD THE TALLY HALL, AND BLOCK THE BELL TOWER. WHEN THAT WENT OUT TO HIBBERTITY LIBERTY.WE TRUE IN THE TOWEL OVY CONCERNS OVER SIGHT LINES IN THE DOWNTOWN AREA. I OBVIOUSLY WAS NOT A PART OF THE COUNCIL AT THAT TIME, BUT PEOPLE STILL SAY HOW DISAPPOINTED THEY ARE THAT THOSE BEAUTIFUL OLD VIEWS ARE GONE. IT COUNTS FOR SOMETHING. IT COUNTS FOR CHARACTER AND IT COUNTS FOR SORT OF PERSPECTIVE ON THE CITY, AND IT KIND OF SHOWS WHAT THIS DOWNTOWN AREA HAS BEEN ABOUT, AND IT'S BEEN ABOUT MAXIMIZING THE SQUARE FOOTAGE TO GRAB THAT TAXABLE VALUE. AND IN THE FUTURE, HOPEFULLY IT WILL BE ABOUT MAXIMIZING THAT SQUARE FOOTAGE TO PROVIDE THE TYPE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND RANGE OF HOUSING THAT WE NEED. SO I'M NOT A FAN OF THE THIS BUILDING, I APPRECIATE THAT THE MICHIGAN THEATER IS TRYING TO WORK IT IN FOR THEIR BENEFIT AND THAT'S A GREAT INSTITUTION. IT'S HAD HARD TO SAY NO TO THIST I WILL FIND A WAY.
02:58:09.199: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
02:58:10.200: >> Councilmember Lumm: I TOO HAVE MIXED VIEWS ON THIS AND APPRECIATE HEARING WHAT MY COLLEAGUES HAVE TO SAY. CLEARLY, THERE ARE POSITIVES. THE 240 HOUSING UNITS ARE A WELCOMED ADDITION AND THE FACT THAT 19 OF THE UNITS ARE ARE AFORWARDABLE UNITS IS AIS -- AFFORDABLE UNITS IS A POSITIVE. AND THE STORMWATER PLAN REPRESENTS AN IMPROVEMENT TO THE AREA AND THE. SPACE PLAN WITH THE MIDBLOCK WALKWAY SPACE WILL BE ATTRACTIVE ON TOP OF IMPROVING CONNECTIVITY AND, YOU KNOW, I CAN APPRECIATE AS WELL THAT THE REPRESENTATIVE OF UNITED METHODIST IS HERE TO SPEAK TO THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT FOR THEIR COMMUNITY. THE SOLAR ARRAY AND THE LEED SILVER ARE ALSO POSITIVE ATTRIBUTES TO THE PROJECT. LIKE MANY FOLKS WE HAVE HEARD FROM, MY PRIMARY CONCERN IS THE LIGHT. THE 180 FEET THAT'S ALLOWED IN D-1 WOULD BE QUITE DRAMATIC IN THIS SPACE. AND THE PROPOSALS WE KNOW IS TO ADD AN ADDITIONAL 28 FEET OR 15% ON TOP OF THAT TO MAKE THE BUILDING 208 FEET TALL AND 19 STORIES. IT IS NOT CLEAR TO ME THAT THAT FITS WELL, AND IS COMPATIBLE WITH THE IMMEDIATE AREA. I'M ALSO CONCERNED THAT TO ACHIEVE THE EXTRA HEIGHT, THE ONLY ADDITIONAL BENEFIT THAT THE CITY REALLY RECEIVES IS THE COMMITMENT TO LEED SILVER CERTIFICATION. I THINK ONE COULD ARGUE THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT SHOULD HAPPEN  ANYWAY. IT'S NOT A SUFFICIENT ADDED COMMUNITY BENEFIT TO JUSTIFY THE ADDED HEIGHT AND AS MANY HAVE NOTED, YOU KNOW, I THINK IT'S WORTH NOTING AGAIN THAT THE PROJECT WOULD NOT HAVE QUALIFIED. IT WAS IN THE PIPELINE UNDER THE NEW SET OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING PREMIUM RULES. I'M CERTAINLY NOT SUGGESTING THAT IT'S FAIR TO CHANGE THE RULES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GAME, BECAUSE IT'S NOT. THAT'S NOT A REASON TO OPPOSE THE PROJECT, BUT I THINK IT PROVIDES SOME PERSPECTIVE ON THE ASK AND ON THE BENEFIT. ALTHOUGH, I WILL ALSO JUST NOTE HEARING FROM SOME FOLKS IN THE DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY THAT THESE RECENTLY ADOPTED RULES MIGHT STYMIE FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS BECAUSE IT'S -- I SEE HEADS NODDING -- BECAUSE ECONOMICALLY, IT'S SIMPLY NOT A FEASIBLE PROPOSITION. SO WE WILL NEED TO -- WE WILL LEARN AS WE GO FORWARD ON THAT ONE. AND I'M ALSO CONCERNED AS I A ALWAYS AM. THAT THE PARKING PROVIDED, WHICH IN THIS CASE 146 UNITS WILL NOT BE ADEQUATE, BUT THE 142 NUMBER REFLECTS OUR RULES AND AT LEAST THERE'S SOME OFFSTREET PARKING HERE THAT IS NOT ALWAYS THE CASE WHEN WE NOW AGAIN -- I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO WHAT MY OTHER COLLEAGUES HAVE TO SAY ON THIS. THE -- YEAH, I MEAN, -- AND THE COMMENTS FROM THE COMMUNITY ARE SIGNIFICANT, YOU KNOW WHEN YOU HEAR PEOPLE SAY YOU ARE CANNIBALIZING OUR CULTURE, OUR -- YOU KNOW, THE CHARM SHOULD MATTER. I DO THINK THAT THOSE ARE NOT IN THE BENEFIT DESCRIBED AS FAUSTIAN. YOU KNOW? AND I THINK -- FAUSTIAN. THE VERTICAL SPRAWL, ON AND ON. SO THOSE ARE, I THINK, LEGIT CONCERNS. AND -- BUT AS THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM UNITED METHODIST ALSO SAID, WE DON'T OWN THE PROPERTY, BUT THESE ARE THINGS TO -- TO CONSIDER, YOU KNOW, IN A THOUGHTFUL MANNER WHICH WE ALL ARE DOING.
03:01:54.024: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
03:01:55.359: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, MAYOR TAYLOR. THERE ARE A LOT OF CONCERNS WITH THIS DEVELOPMENT. YOU KNOW, WE TALK ABOUT THE GENTRIFICATION OF OUR COMMUNITY AND WE HAVE BEEN SEEING THAT FOR A COUPLE OF DECADES AT LEAST, AND I BELIEVE WITH PROVIDING AND GIVING AWAY THESE PREMIUMS FOR LITTLE IN RETURN, WE INDUCE THE SPECULATION THAT IN TURN STRIVES SMALL BUSINESSES AWAY IN OUR COMMUNITY. SMALL BUSINESSES ARE THE FABRIC OF THE COMMUNITY. AND, AGAIN, I KNOW VERY WELL TWO SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS OF MANY YEARS THAT HAVE BEEN DRIVEN AWAY FROM THIS AREA OF TOWN. I'M EXTREMELY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. HIGHLY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT ENROLLMENT AT THE UNIVERSITY, I UNDERSTAND THAT'S IN OUR PURVIEW OF THE PRESSURES IT PUTS ON THE REST OF OUR COMMUNITY, BUT I THINK THAT'S AN ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE TACKLED NOT JUST IN THIS CHAMBER, BUT WITH THE BOARD OF REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN. I ALSO QUESTION WHETHER WE ARE AT A PEAK ENROLLMENT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN. I BELIEVE THE LAST THING I READ THERE WAS 49.9% OF THE STUDENT POPULATION THAT COMES IN NOW IS EITHER OUT-OF-STATE OR OUT-OF-COUNTRY. THIS IS A PUBLIC UNIVERSITY. I HAVE A REALLY STRONG QUESTION TO ASK THEM, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR THEIR FUTURE ENROLLMENT? ARE THEY GOING TO CROSS THE 50% MARK? AND STILL CALL THEMSELVES A PUBLIC UNIVERSITY? I BEG THE QUESTION. I THINK FOLKS THAT COME TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN ALSO LOOK AT HOUSING COSTS. AND THAT'S GOING TO BE A BIG FACTOR IN THE FUTURE DECISIONS THAT ARE MADE BY PEOPLE THAT COME TO THE UNIVERSITY. I WOULD CHALLENGE MY COLLEAGUE, WHO CLAIMS THAT WE'RE JUST GOING TO END UP WITH MORE UNITS EVEN WITH DISPLACING WHAT'S THIS NOW. IF THIS CAME IN AS A BY RIGHT DEVELOPMENT, THERE ARE MANY MORE UNITS THAT CAN BE PUT THIS, BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT IS BEING ASKED. WE ARE BEING ASKED TO APPROVE SOMETHING THAT GIVES PUBLIC BENEFIT. I FRANKLY HAVE A HIGH WATERMARK WHEN IT COMES TO APPROVING THESE TYPE OF DEVELOPMENTS. IF IT'S GOING TO BE A PUBLIC BENEFIT, IT NEEDS TO BE MORE THAN JUST RESPONSIBLE DEVELOPMENT. WHAT'S BEEN OUTLINED AS PUBLIC BENEFIT IS FRANKLY RESPONSIBLE DEVELOPMENT THAT I WOULD EXPECT FROM ANYBODY DOING BUSINESS IN MY COMMUNITY, INCLUDING MYSELF. AND, YOU KNOW, THERE ARE CONCERNS WITH PARKING. THIS IS 127 SPACES FOR A QUARTER -- OVER A QUARTER MILLION SQUARE FEET. IN AN AREA THAT'S ALREADY CHOKED WITH PROBLEMS WITH PARKING. YOU KNOW, I KNOW IT'S ONLY A QUARTER MILE AWAY FROM THE LAST DEVELOPMENT THAT WE APPROVED, BUT I SEE THESE AS VERY DISTINCTIVE PARTS OF OUR CITY. IN FACT, THIS HE HAVE TWO DIFFERENT ASSOCIATIONS THAT REPRESENT THOSE AREAS. AND I'M RUNNING OUT OF TIME. BUT I WILL LEAVE IT ON THIS, I DO QUESTION AND I HAVE CONCERNS AT WHETHER THOSE NEW PREMIUMS THAT WE PASSED WILL STYMIE DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN TOLD IT WILL BE ECONOMICALLY NOT PRACTICAL TO -- TO COME UNDER THOSE NEW -- THOSE NEW BENEFITS, THOSE NEW ASKS WITH THOSE PREMIUMS. SO I WILL LEAVE IT AT THAT FOR NOW. THANK YOU.

03:05:58.902: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO APPLY THE OLD RULES TO THIS PROJECT, BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I THINK WE NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE PROGRESS AND IMPROVEMENT THAT THIS COUNCIL HAS MADE IN THE AREA OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND MOST OF MY CONCERNS HAVE ALREADY BEEN RAISED, BUT I HAVE A COUPLE RELATED TO PEDESTRIAN AND CYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE. THE DESIGN OF THIS BUILDING, WOULD IT PRECLUDE HAVING AN INIVE STREET BIKE INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE FUTURE? SOME TYPE OF BIKE LANE SIMILAR TO WILLIAMS STREET?
03:06:40.210: >> NOTHING ABOUT OUR PROJECT WOULD CONCLUDE THAT.
03:06:43.246: >> Councilmember Griswold: OKAY. AND I DO APPRECIATE THAT YOU DO HAVE A LOADING ZONE AREA ON WASHINGTON. I THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT. AND MY OTHER QUESTION IS REGARDING THE MIDBLOCK CROSSWALK AND I BELIEVE THAT THE DEVELOPER HAS OFFERED TO FUND OR WOULD SUPPORT A MIDBLOCK CROSSWALK; IS THAT CORRECT?
03:07:07.170: >> THAT IS CORRECT.
03:07:07.937: >> Councilmember Griswold: OKAY. AND IT'S NOT CONSTRUCTED, IT'S FUND THE CONSTRUCT OF IT?
03:07:12.475: >> YES. I MEAN, WE WOULD -- SINCE ALL OF THAT WORK WITH BE DONE IN THE PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY, WE WOULD LOOK TO THE CITY TO AUTHORIZE WHO CAN WORK IN THAT PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY AND THEN WE WOULD WORK TO HELP PAY FOR THOSE IMPROVEMENTS. WE HAD A MIDBLOCK PEDESTRIAN CROSSWALK ON AN EARLIER VERSION OF THE PLAN, AND MOVING FORWARD IT WAS -- IT FELT THAT RATHER THAN LOCK THAT POSITION INTO OUR SITE PLAN, THE CITY WANTED TO STUDY WHERE IT MIGHT BE MORE APPROPRIATE. SO WE TOCK IT OFF OF IT.
03:07:44.674: >> Councilmember Griswold: -- WE TOOK IT OFF OF IT.
03:07:48.878: >> Councilmember Griswold: OKAY. I APPRECIATE THAT. WE HAD SOME PEDESTRIAN INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE RIGHT-OF-WAY THAT WAS EITHER PART OF -- WELL, IT WAS PART OF THE SITE PLAN, AND WE HAVE HAD PROBLEMS WITH SIDEWALKS DOWN IN LOWER TOWN, NOT BEING CONSTRUCTED, NOT BEING CONSTRUCTED AT THE RIGHT TIME, TWO SIDEWALKS BEING CONSTRUCTED AT THE SAME TIME WHICH MEANT THIS WAS NO PLACE TO WALK, AND THE SITE PLAN FOR CONCORDIA COLLEGE INCLUDED A CROSSWALK WHERE IT WAS DONE OVER THE PERIOD OF -- A PERIOD OF MANY WEEKS, WHICH MEANT AT ONE POINT IT LOOKED LIKE A CROSSWALK TO THE PEDESTRIANS BUT THE DRIVERS WERE UNAWARE THAT IT WAS A CROSSWALK. AND EVEN NOW WE DO NOT HAVE LIGHTING AT THAT CROSSWALK. SO IN CONCLUSION, WHAT I'M STATING IS MY PREFERENCE THAT ANY INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE RIGHT-OF-WAY BE COMPLETED BY THE CITY SO WE HAVE CONTROL OF IT. SO THANK YOU.
03:08:51.775: >> Mayor Taylor: I'M GOING TO, MYSELF, SUPPORT THE BUILDING. I HEAR WHERE MY COLLEAGUES ARE ON A NUMBER OF THESE POINTS. I GUESS WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT THE -- THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN WHAT IS BEING PROPOSED, AS A BUILDING AND UNDER A PLANNED PROJECT STRUCTURE AND WHAT IS BY RIGHT ARE, I THINK, IMPORTANT. THERE ARE THINGS THAT WE ARE -- WE ARE OBTAINING ADDITIONAL AND IMPORTANT UNITS UNITS OF FORWARE HOUSING. THE -- OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THE LEED CRITERIA. MEETING THE LEED CRITERIA IS AN IMPORTANT PUBLIC BENEFIT. AND THE STORMWATER IS AN IMPORTANT BENEFIT IN MY MIND. I WOULD LIKE TO POINT TO THE SOLID WASTE PLAN WITH RESPECT TO A PUBLIC BENEFIT. I'M NOT SURE THAT THAT'S A PARTICULAR CRITERIA, BUT THE -- YOU KNOW, THAT IS -- YOU KNOW, HOW WE DEAL WITH SOLID WASTE IN THE DOWNTOWN IS CONTESTED GROUNDS AND THE PHYSICAL -- THE PHYSICALITY OF THE GEOMETRY DOES NOT ENABLE US TO DO THE JO BE THAT WE WOULD ALWAYS -- JOB THAT WE WOULD ALWAYS LIKE TO BE ABLE TO DO AND THE IDEA AF OF ADDRESG THIS VERY IMPORTANT CORNER TAKING GARBAGE OFF THE STREET, HAVING A NEIGHBOR THAT'S WILLING TO WORK WITH NEIGHBORS ON -- TO ADDRESS THIS COMMON PUBLIC PROBLEM, THAT'S IMPORTANT TO ME. AND I THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ARE GETTING HERE. I THINK TOO, ALTHOUGH THE -- THE MICHIGAN THEATER IS NOT THE PUBLIC. IT'S THE NEXT BEST THING. AND THE BENEFITS OF THESE TWO STRUCTURES TO THE MICHIGAN THEATER, I THINK CANNOT BE GAME SET AND THAT IS -- THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WILL IMPROVE AND BENEFIT THE ANN ARBOR COMMUNITY FOR YEARS TO COME. I THINK THAT THIS IS A PROJECT THAT -- THAT IS EARNED -- THAT HAS EARNED OUR SUPPORT AND I'M HOPING IT WILL MOVE FORWARD. COUNCICOUNCILMEMBER EATON?
03:10:56.332: >> Councilmember Eaton: THANK YOU. I STRUGGLED WITH THIS ONE, BECAUSE WE HAVE TO JUDGE IT UNDER THE OLD STANDARDS NOT UNDER THE NEW PREMIUMS. ALTHOUGH IT WOULD BE REALLY NICE TO GET THOSE 72 UNITS OF AFFORD AABLE HOUSING IN THIS PROJECT, IT WOULD PROBABLY MAKE IT FINANCIALLY NOT VIABLE. AND SO WE REALLY HAVE TO LOOK AT THE PLANNED PROJECT CRITERIA, WHICH IS NOT VERY RIGOROUS, AND SO SATISFYING ANY EIGHT OF THE POSSIBILITIES IN THE CODE, QUALIFIES A PROJECT FOR A PLANNED PROJECT. I'M NOT A BIG FAN OF PLANNED PLD PROJECTS. I DON'T THINK THAT JUST BECAUSE IT SATISFIES ONE OF THOSE CRITERIA, IT AUTOMATICALLY DESERVES APPROVAL AS A PLANNED PROJECT. BUT TO TURN IT DOWN AS A PLANNED PROJECT WOULD REALLY SUBJECT THE WHOLE PROJECT TO THE NEW PREMIUMS WHICH WOULD PROBABLY MEAN THAT IT CAN NOT BE BUILT AND I'M NOT SURE THAT THAT'S WHAT I WOULD WANT TO DO. IF I THOUGHT THAT REJECTING THE PLANNED PROJECT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T GIVE IT ENOUGH EMOTION WOULD BRING IT BACK IN A BETTER FORMAT AND GIVE US MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING, I WOULD DO IT IN A MINUTE. AS A BO PONDER, THIS I BELIEVE T WE WILL SUPPORT THIS RELUCTANTLY BECAUSE WE WILL NOT GET SOMETHING BETTER THAN THIS, IF WE TURN THIS DOWN TONIGHT.
03:12:29.058: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER SMITH.
03:12:30.893: >> Councilmember Smith: SO THIS HAS BEEN SOME GOOD LISTENING THAT I HAVE ON ABOUT ABLE TO DO AND I THINK, YOU KNOW, WHAT A LOT OF THIS COMES DOWN TO IS DISCOMFORT OVER THE HEIGHT OF A BUILDING AND I WOULD SUGGEST THAT ONE WAY TO REDUCE THIS WOULD BE TO NOT REQUIRE PARKING AND I SAY THAT AND I KNOW THAT'S ANATHMA, THE TRANSIT SCORE IS A 74. BIKABLE SCORE IS 85. PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN THIS BUILDING, IF THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE CARS CAN AFFORD TO PAY TO STORE THEM. WE'RE REQUIRING AN AWFUL LOT OF CAR STORAGE SPACE WHICH IS ADDING THE BUILDING HEIGHT, PERSONALLY. I WOULD LOVE TO GET RID OF THAT CAR STORAGE AND LOWER THIS BIBUILDING AND MAKE IT MORE APPEALING TO SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES. THAT'S NOT WHERE WE ARE. I REALIZE I'M CERTAINLY IN THE MINORITY IN MY FEELINGS ON CAR STORAGE, BUT THAT'S HOW I FEEL ABOUT IT. I THINK THAT THIS PROJECT OFFERS LOTS OF BENEFITS, HAVING WORKED IN AN OFFICE IN THE CADILLAC BUILDING FOR JUST UNDER EIGHT YEARS, THOSE FOUR RENTAL UNITS ARE NOT AWESOME. I THINK THAT THERE'S CERTAINLY NOT NECESSARILY A GOOD NEIGHBOR TO THE MACHIN MACHIN MICHIGAN T. I THINK THESE TWO PROJECTS TAKEN TOGETHER MAKE A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT TO THAT CORNER OF THE STATE STREET DISTRICT. I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS. I'M DOING IT WITH NO RESERVATIONS. THE ONLY THING IS, YOU KNOW, I REALLY WISH, YOU KNOW, WE COULD HAVE AN HONEST DISCUSSION ABOUT CAR STORAGE, BECAUSE IT'S -- IT'S MAKING THINGS UNTENABLE IN OUR DOWNTOWN AND I THINK AS WE LOOK AT THE BIGGER PICTURE OF HOW WE LOOK AT LAND USE, IF SINGLE FAMILY ZONING IS SACROSANCT, THEN WE NEED TO BE MORE CREATIVE IN THINKING ABOUT HOW TO REPURPOSE SOME OF OUR COMMERCIAL DISTRICTS TO ACCOMMODATE MIXED USE AND DENSITY. THANK YOU.
03:14:48.498: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER AND THEN LUMM.
03:14:54.504: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I JUST HAD A QUESTION. I'M NOT SURE WHO COULD ANSWER THIS. MAYBE MR. CAAN. SO WHEN WE AGREED TO A DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT WITH A DEVELOPER, AND A BUILDER, THE SITE PLANS AND THE ELEVATIONS AND THE MATERIALS LISTED AND ALL OF THOSE THINGS THAT YOU SEE, THAT WE SEE AS A CITY OR THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT SEES AND APPROVES AND THEREBY IS BROUGHT TO US TO APPROVE, HOW IS THAT ENFORCED? LIKE, ARE THE MATERIALS AND THE DRAWINGS AND THE ELEVATIONS, THTHAT'S ENFORCED THROUGH THE INSPECTION PROCESS?
03:15:30.973: >> YES. I CAN DESCRIBE THE PROCESS TO YOU.
03:15:34.377: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I MEAN BRIEFLY, WITH MY COLLEAGUES -- IS THAT OKAY? I THINK IT WILL BE EDUCATIONAL, BUT I HAD A LOT OF PEOPLE EXPRESS -- THE REASON I ASK IS I HAD PEOPLE EXPRESS CONCERNS ABOUT A PROJECT THAT'S ADJACENT TO THIS SITE, I THINK IT'S CALLED THE CORNER LOFTS PROJECT WHERE IT WAS DESIGNED ONE WAY AND WENT UP A DIFFERENT WAY.
03:15:52.762: >> YEAH. SO PROBABLY ABOUT 15 YEARS AGO, MAYBE 13 YEARSA. A PROJECT WAS CONSTRUCTED THAT WAS FINISHED IN A MANNER DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WAS WHAT PROVED PI CITY COUNCIL. SINCE THAT POINT IN TIME, THE CITY COUNCIL HAS REQUIRED THAT WE INCLUDE LANGUAGE WITHIN THE DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT THAT STIPULATES THAT ANY MATERIAL CHANGE, ANY SUBSTANTIVE CHANGE TO THE ELEVATIONS OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT NEEDS TO GO BACK TO CITY COUNCIL FOR THEIR APPROVAL. SO WE CHECK THE CONSTRUCTION DRAWINGS WHEN THEY COME IN, WHICH IS TYPICALLY AFTER SITE PLANS HAVE BEEN APPROVED, AND WE COMPARE IT DIRECTLY WITH THE APPROVED SITE PLAN, AND WE LOOK AT EVERY WINDOW, EVERY SQUARE INCH TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY MATCH. AND SO THAT'S THE PROCESS WE GO THROUGH, SO THAT THE BUILDING PERMIT THAT IS ISSUED IS CONSISTENT WITH THE APPROVED ELEVATION.
03:16:50.620: >> Councilmember Hayner:  AND SO SINCE THAT LANGUAGE IS PUT IN PLACE, WHAT HAPPENS IF, YOU COME OUT THERE AND THEY ARE RUNNING THE SCAFFOLD UP AND THE BRICK IS UP, AND IT'S NOT THE SAME, WHAT DO YOU DO?
03:16:59.395: >> SO FAR WE HAVEN'T -- WE HAVEN'T RUN ACROSS THAT PROBLEM. BUT IN OTHER CITIES, MUNICIPALITIES HAVE DEALT WITH THAT ISSUE. NEW YORK CITY FORCES A DEVELOPER TO REMOVE MULTIPLE STORIES FROM A BUILDING THAT WAS CONSTRUCTED INCONSISTENT WITH HOW IT WAS -- HOW IT WAS APPROVED.
03:17:20.116: >> Councilmember Hayner: OKAY.
03:17:21.484: >> SO WE DO KNOW HOW TO ENFORCE CODE. WE DO NOT HOW TO WRITE TICKETS, AND WE DO HAVE ATTORNEYS.
03:17:29.125: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I APPRECIATE THAT ANSWER I WAS CURIOUS WHAT PROHIBITS THAT FROM HAPPENING IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU.
03:17:38.200: >> I THINK IT IS -- AND MR. POSTEMA CAN CONFIRM IT, THE LEVERAGE IS THE CITY HAS IS THEY WILL NOT ISSUE A CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY. YOU CAN'T MOVE ANYBODY IN, IF IT'S NOT COMPLIANT WITH THE DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT.
03:17:49.612: >> THAT'S ONE THE LEAVAGES, YES.
03:17:54.050: >> Councilmember Hayner:  THAT ONE COMES PRETTY LATE. THAT BIT OF LEVERAGE COMES LATE IN THE PROCESS. IT'S HARD TO EVERY LEVERAGE AT T POINT.
03:18:05.227: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
03:18:06.095: >> Councilmember Lumm: I WILL TAKE A PASS.
03:18:07.496: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
03:18:12.068: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES.
03:18:15.838: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
03:18:16.339: >> Councilmember Eaton: YES.
03:18:16.939: >> Councilmember Nelson:  YES.
03:18:18.741: >> Councilmember Smith: YES.
03:18:19.342: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  NO.
03:18:21.844: >> Councilmember Hayner: NOPE.
03:18:23.646: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES.
03:18:26.515: >> Councilmember Griswold:
03:18:29.151: >> Councilmember Griswold. YES.
03:18:31.020: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES.
03:18:32.121: >> Councilmember Grand: YES.
03:18:32.722: >> Mayor Taylor: DO WE HAVE COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE CITY ATTORNEY?
03:18:36.058: >> City Atty. Postema: NO, MAYOR.
03:18:37.660: >> Mayor Taylor: WE HAVE BEFORE US, THE CLERK'S REPORT FOR COMMUNICATIONS, PETITIONS AND REFERRALS. MAY I HAVE A MOTION TO APPROVE. MOVED BY HAYNERED AND SECONDED BY LUMM. DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED IT'S APPROVED. WE NOW TO PUBLIC COMMENT GENERAL TIME. IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO SPEAK TO COUNCIL AND THE COMMUNITY ABOUT MATTERS OF MUNICIPAL INTEREST. TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT GENERAL TIME, ONE NEED NOT TO HAVE SIGNED UP IN ADVANCE. SPEAKERS HAVE THREE MINUTES IN WHICH TO SPEAK. SO PLEASE PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE TIME CLOCK. WE MAY HAVE ONLY ONE PERSON SPEAKING AT A TIME AND FINALLY, IF YOU REQUIRE ASSISTANCE IN SPEAKING BEFORE COUNCIL TODAY, WE WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO PROVIDE IT TO YOU. IS T THERE ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT?
03:19:20.336: >> THANK YOU FOR VOTING YES. JUST ABOUT PARKING. LET THE FREE MARKET DECIDE. IF YOU HAVE AN APARTMENT COMPLEX THAT DOESN'T HAVE PARKING, AND THAT MATTERS TO PEOPLE, THEY WILL GO TO ANOTHER PLACE THAT HAS PARKING. AND IF ENOUGH PEOPLE LEAVE THAT APARTMENT COMPLEX, THAT MEANS THAT APARTMENT COMPLEX WILL HAVE TO LOWER THEIR RATES TO APPEAL TO PEOPLE COME IN. LET THE MARKET DECIDE. AND SO I'M ALL IN FAVOR OF APARTMENTS THAT HAVE NO PARKING BECAUSE IT WILL HELP -- THE MARK WILL DECIDE FOR YOU. OTHERWISE HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.
03:19:49.065: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU S. THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT?
03:19:55.604: >> HELLO, FOLKS. ANOTHER GOOD MEETING. I'M REALING STRUG WILLING STRUGD THE WORDS. I SEE YOU WORKING TO THE MORE THAN YOU HAVE IN THE PAST AND I'M PROUD THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO SETTLE SOME DIFFERENCES AND MOVE FORWARD WITH SOME THINGS. SO MY NAME AGAIN IS ZACHARY STORY, AND, CURRENTLY I'M LIVING WITH SOME HOUSING INSECURITY. I DON'T CALL MYSELF HOMELESS, BECAUSE HOME IS WHERE THE HEART IS, RIGHT? AND REALLY, I DON'T WANT ANYBODY'S SYMPATHY OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT, LIKE I'M USED TO TRAVELING AROUND AND DOING THIS IN OTHER CITIES. THIS IS LIKE JUST THE NEXT ADVENTURE FOR ME. BUT, YOU KNOW, ONE OF ANN ARBOR'S NICKNAMES IS 25, 26 SQUARE MILES SURROUNDED BY REALITY AND LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, I HAVE DISCOVERED SOME HARD REALITY AT THE DELONIS CENTER. IT'S -- I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THE AMOUNT OF, LIKE, THE INVISIBLE COMMUNITY THAT'S OUT THERE AND I HAVE SPENT HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF HOURS OUT ON THE STREET. I HAVE BEEN BOUNCING AROUND ON COUCHES AND STAYING AT THE DELONIS CENTER, THE WARMING CENTER WHICH IS ABOUT 50 GUYS SLEEPING ON MATS AT NIGHT. YOU KNOW, IT -- IT'S GREAT THAT THE CITY HAS THESE SERVICES, BUT IT HAS SHOWN ME THE NEED AND THERE REALLY ISN'T A LOT OF SUPPLY. I'M ON A WAITING LIST TO GO -- BE UPSTAIRS ON THE THIRD FLOOR THE DELONIS CENTER WHICH IS EXPECTED TO BE AT LEAST THREE MONTHS. THE WAIT LIST TO BE IN, YOU KNOW, SUBSIDIZED, LOW-INCOME HOUSING IS AT LEAST FOUR MONTHS, MORE LIKELY EIGHT MONTHS TO A YEAR OR EVEN LONGER. SO, YOU KNOW, THIS HAS BEEN A VERY HUMBLING EXPERIENCE FOR ME. IT'S BEEN, YOU KNOW, -- IT'S BEEN GOOD FOR ME TO, YOU KNOW, GO TO THE -- I GO TO THE FREE BREAKFAST, AND I'M GOING TO THE FREE MEALS AND FINDING COMMUNITY WITH OUR NEIGHBORS THAT -- THAT WE DON'T SEE EVERY DAY OR THINK ABOUT. SO THAT'S JUST A LITTLE ABOUT MY EXPERIENCE AND I GUESS I WILL HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL NEXT MEETING TO TALK ABOUT PEDESTRIAN SAFETY. THANK YOU.
03:22:59.321: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT? SEEING NO ONE, PUBLIC COMMENT IS CLOSED. ARE THERE COMMUNICATIONS FROM COUNCIL? COUNCICOUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
03:23:15.671: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WANTED TO SAY REAL BRIEFLY, THE WOMAN WHO IS HERE FROM FUMPKIN, I KNOW THEY ARE WORKING WITH THE DEVELOPER, I UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE GOING TO, LIKE, REPLANT THEIR BEAUTIFUL GARDEN TO BE FROM A SUN GARDEN TO A SHADE GARDEN, AND THINGS LIKE THAT, WHICH IS REALLY -- I THINK THAT'S DECENT OF THEM TO DO THAT. FORTUNATELY, I BELIEVE -- MY UNDERSTANDING FROM MY KIDS GOING TO THAT COOPERATIVE NURSERY THERE, WHICH IS A GREAT BENEFIT TO THE INTEREST COO THERE, THE OUTDOOR -- COMMUNITY THERE, THE OUTDOOR SPACE FOR THE CHILDREN WILL NOT FULLY INB BE IN SHADE. AND I KNOW MISS JULIE WILL APPRECIATE THAT. MY KIDS BOTH WENT THERE AND THAT'S THE COOPERATIVE SPIRIT THAT NEEDS TO BE FOUND IN MORE PLACES IN THIS CITY. I THINK THAT COOPERATIVE EFFORTS IN HOUSING WOULD GO A LONG WAY, BUT I UNDERSTAND IT'S DIFFICULT TO FIND A DEVELOPER THAT ISN'T IN IT JUST FOR THE BOTTOM LINE. AND I THINK WITH THESE NEW AFFORDABLE HOUSING PREMIUMS, WHICH I'M -- I'M HAPPY THAT WE ARE DOING, YOU KNOW, WE MIGHT HAVE TO SIT OUT A LITTLE MARKET RATE HOUSING UNTIL WE GET WHAT WE WANT, JUST LIKE WE LOOK FOR DEVELOPERS WHO ARE WILLING TO GO BEYOND SORT OF A LEED SILVER THING AND MAKE SOME GUARANTEES ABOUT THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND CARBON NEUTRALITY OF THEIR BUILDINGS AND ANN ARBOR IS A PLACE THAT PEOPLE WANT TO LIVE AND BUILD AND, YOU NO HE YOU KNE MIGHT HAVE TO WAIT OUT FOR THE RIGHT TYPE OF BUILDERS. THAT'S WHAT THE OPEN MARKET HAS TO GO THROUGH TO BECOME A MORE EQUITABLE CITY.
03:24:52.935: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER COMMUNICATIONS? I HAVE NONE. DO WE HAVE A CLOSED SESSION TODAY? WE DO HAVE A CLOSED SESSION, MAYOR. WE HAVE A CLOSED SESSION ON PENDING LITIGATION IN THE GELMAN MATTER AND THE WASHTENAW CIRCUIT COURT AND WE ALSO HAVE A -- A CLOSED SESSION ON POTENTIAL LAND PURCHASE.
03:25:14.390: >> Mayor Taylor: MAY I HAVE A MOTION TO GO INTO CLOSED SESSION ON THOSE BASIS. MOVED BY HAYNER AND SECONDED BY LUMM. DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
03:25:25.534: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES.
03:25:28.203: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
