00:01:13.062: >> Clerk Beaudry: WE HAVE A QUORUM.
00:01:15.598: >> WE HAVE A MOTION TO MOVE THE AGENDA, MOVED BY ACKERMAN AND LUMM. DISCUSSION OF THE AGENDA? ALL IN FAVOR,. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? THE AGENDA IS PROVED. DO WE HAVE COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR?
00:01:27.509: >> City Admin. Lazarus: WE DO. I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE FOR HELPING TO MAKE THE TRANSITION FROM HAVING CITY HALL GUEST SERVICES DESK STAFFED DOWNSTAIRS THIS MORNING. BY ALL ACCOUNTS THINGS WENT SMOOTHLY AND SEAMLESSLY. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE ADMINISTRATOR'S REPORT ATTACHED TO THE AGENDA, THERE'S A NEW SECTION TO IT THIS EVENING THE SUSTAINABILITY AND INNOVATIONS CORNER. SO WE WILL USE THAT AS A WAY TO COMMUNICATE WHAT'S GOING ON WITH OUR SUSTAINABILITY PROGRAMS. THIS IS ROAD CONSTRUCTION SEASON, AND THERE'S MUCH TO DO THIS YEAR. WE HAVE PLANS TO RESURFACE OR RESTORE 12 MAJOR STREETS, 33 LOCAL STREETS AND AN ADDITIONAL 40 MAJOR AND LOCAL STREETS ARE UNDERGOGOING PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE. SO FOR THOSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO TALK ABOUT FIXING THE ROADS, THAT'S WHAT FIXING THE ROADS LOOKS LIKE. THERE'S A SPECIAL ELECTION TOMORROW. SO PLEASE GO TO THE CITY'S WEBSITE FOR ANY PARTICULARS ABOUT YOUR POLLING LOCATION. I WOULD ALSO REMIND FOLKS THAT THERE IS CONSTRUCTION AROUND THE MARY STREET POLLING PLACE. SO IF YOU VOTE THERE ARE, PLEASE PAY SPECIAL ATTENTION THERE. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK OFFICER COLLEEN McCARTHY FOR BEING HERE, AND I THINK OUR INTREPID FIRE MARSHAL KATHLEEN SUMMERSGILL IS SOMEWHERE AROUND AS WELL. SO THANKS TO HER FOR BEING HERE. THAT'S ALL I GOT.
00:02:44.987: >> Mayor Taylor: ALL RIGHT. I HAVE NO INTRODUCTIONS TODAY. WE COME TO PUBLIC COMMENT RESERVE TIME. IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO SPEAK TO COUNCIL AND THE COMMUNITY ABOUT MATTERS OF MUNICIPAL INTEREST. TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT RESERVE TIME, ONE NEEDS TO HAVE SIGNED UP IN ADVANCE BY CONTACTING OUR CITY CLERK. SPEAKERS HAVE THREE MINUTES IN WHICH TO SPEAK SO PLEASE PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE TIME CLOCK. WE MAY ONLY HAVE ONE PERSON SPEAKING AT A TIME. IF YOU REQUIRE ASSISTANCE IN SPEAKING BEFORE COUNCIL TODAY, WE WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO PROVIDE IT TO YOU. OUR FIRST SPEAKER IS K.P. UNNIKRISHNAN.
00:03:23.659: >> THANK YOU, MAYOR TAYLOR.
00:03:25.127: >> THANK YOU.
00:03:25.627: >> THE LAST TIME I WAS IN THE CITY TRA HALL WITH YOU, YOU WERE MARRYING TWO OF OUR FRIENDS. AND WE WERE RUNNING AROUND WITH A CAMERA. TODAY I'M TALKING ABOUT DOGS ON LEASH IN THE FAIRVIEW CEMETERY. FAIRVIEWCEMETERY IS A PLACE CLOSE DO MY HEART. I LIVE ACROSS THE STREET. I GET UP AT 5:00 IN THE MORNING. THAT GIVES ME PEACE OF MIND. I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO SAY. IT IS A VERY SERENE PLACE. AND AS IT HAPPENS, THERE ARE FEW PEOPLE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD WITH DOGS THAT WALK THEIR DOGS IN THE CEMETERY. THE CURRENT LAW SAYS YOU CAN HAVE PETS ON LEASH. SO THE AGENDA ITEM TODAY IS GOING TO -- IS TO CHANGE THAT. MY REQUEST TO YOU ALL, DON'T CHANGE IT. BECAUSE IF YOU CHANGE IT, THAT SERENE PLACE WILL GO TO DOGS! I'M TELLING YOU. BECAUSE WHAT USED TO HAPPEN THERE, BEFORE PEOPLE STARTED WALKING THE DOGS AT ALL HOURS, WAS THAT THERE WERE DRUG DEALS. THERE WERE SEX ACTS GOING IN CARS AND THINGS OF THAT SORT. SO IF THE NEIGHBORHOOD STARTS USING THE CEMETERY, IT WILL GO BACK TO ITS ORIGINAL STATE WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY, YOU KNOW, A NO MAN'S LAND. PLEASE DON'T DO IT, GUYS, GIRLS, WOMEN, GENTLEMEN. THE NEIGHBORS HAVE BEEN WALKING THEIR DOGS WITHOUT AN ISSUE FOR 25 YEARS. I THINK DAVE NEWMAN HAS BEEN WALKING FOR 25 YEARS. IT'S ONLY RECENTLY THAT SOME QUOTE/UNQUOTE PROBLEMS CROPPED UP. I DON'T THINK IT'S A PROBLEM WITH THE NEIGHBORHOOD, BUT THE CURRENT CONTRACTOR. I SENT YOU ALL A DETAILED EMAIL. I DON'T WANT TO TAKE UP TODAY'S TIMES. PLEASE DON'T CHANGE THE RULES. LET DOGS BE ALLOWED ON LEASH IN THE CEMETERY. THE SECOND POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS THE FOLLOWING, IT'S AN INACTIVE CEMETERY. I WALK THERE EVERYDAY. SO I ESTIMATE THAT THERE MIGHT BE TWO BURIALS IN A YEAR. LESS THAN 10% IS MY ESTIMATE OF THE GRAVESTONES ARE VISITED BY PEOPLE. THE REST IS FOR HISTORIC VALUE. SO IT'S AN HISTORIC CEMETERY IN A PARK-LIKE SETTING. LET US TREAT IT AS SUCH AND DO NOT CHANGE THINGS DRASTICALLY SO THAT THE NEIGHBORHOOD WALKS AWAY FROM THAT PLACE. SO AS  AN ADJUNCT TO THAT, MY SUGGESTION IS THAT THE PARK NEXT DOOR HAD A CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE. CREATE A CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE FOR THE CEMETERY AND THEN WE WILL TAKE SPECIAL CARE OF THE CEMETERY. IT'S OUR OWN CEMETERY. WE ARE NOT GOING TO DESECRATE THAT, BECAUSE THAT'S THE LAST THING WE DO. THIS IS THE FIRST THING I VIEW WHEN I WAKE UP AND DRINK A CUP OF COFFEE TO BRING ME PEACE OF MIND AS A SCIENTIST. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
00:06:25.073: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS CARIN KRISHNAN.
00:06:29.778: >> HI. I HAVE TO READM MY PHONE BECAUSE I'M NOT A GOOD PUBLIC SPEAKER. MY NAME IS CARIN KRISHNAN AND I LOVE ACROSS THE VEIT FROM FAIRVIEW CEMETERY. I USED TO WATCH MY DOG ON THE LEASH IN THE CEMETERY UNTIL I FELT THREATENED BY THE CONTRACTOR WHO MOWS THE LAWN TO THE EXTENT THAT I DID CALL THE POLICE. THIS LAWN MOWING MAN HAD HIS CELL PHONE OUT AND HE WAS RECORDING MY WALK WHILE I GREETED MY NEIGHBOR. WHEN I ASKED HIM TO STOP, HIS HANDS WERE SHAKING. SOMETHING WAS UNSETTLING ABOUT HIS BEHAVIOR. HE SAID SOME VERY UNPROFESSIONAL THINGS TO ME, WHILE STATING THAT THIS WAS HIS PARK, AND HE WORKED FOR THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. AND THAT MY DOG NEEDED TO BE ON THE LEASH. MY DOG WAS ON THE LEASH! WHEN I CALLED THE POLICE, THEY STATED THAT NEXT TIME THIS HAPPENS, I NEED TO CALL THEM IMMEDIATELY, SO THAT THEY COULD SPEAK WITH HIM. I DECIDED TO NO LONGER WALK THERE. I FELT UNSAFE. IN MY OPINION, THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN CREATED BY LAWN MOWER MAN. I RESPECTFULLY ASK THE COUNCIL TO KEEP T THE RULES AS THEY ARE. AND I HAVE SEEN DEER, COYOTE AND COMES COMING UP AND CONDOMS AND SEXUAL AFFAIRS IN CARS, ALCOHOL BOTTLES ALL THAT WE HAVE PICKED UP OR EITHER CHASED AWAY. I'M VERY PROUD OF MY COMMUNITY AND I -- THEY ARE RESPECTFUL, HONEST AND HARD-WORKING CITIZENS WHO LIKE I PICK UP DOG WASTE THAT IS NOT OURS OUT OF COURTESY TO THE CEMETERY. WE CLEAN THE CEMETERY. ANOTHER NEIGHBOR CONTINUALLY MR. NEWMAN FIXES THE GATE, WHEN HE ENTERS THE CEMETERY BECAUSE THE CONTRACTOR WHEN HE OPENS IT, IT BREAKS THE GATE. SO HE GOES TO THE HARDWARE STORE AND BUYS THE MATERIAL AND ROUTINELY FIX THE GATE. WE ALL CONGREGATE AROUND THE CEMETERY. WE MEET OUR NEIGHBORS. I MET A WONDERFUL PIANO TEACHER THANK YOU, SUSAN. I FUND A VET, THANK YOU, BECCA AND MICHAEL. I MET MY CITY COUNCIL, THANK YOU JEFF AND ANN. I FOUND A LOCATION FOR MY DAUGHTER'S WEDDING IN ANN ARBOR ON THE OUTSIDE THANK YOU, DAVID. AND I FOUND A JAZZ BAND TO PLAY THERE, THANK YOU, EVAN. WE OFFER DINNERS TO EACH OTHER WHEN SOMEONE IS SICK OR THERE'S A DEATH IN THE FAMILY. WE HELP -- WE HAVE A COMMUNITY GARDEN. WE NEED A RESIDENT WHO IS DISABLED. SO WE ARE A GOOD COMMUNITY AND WE SHOULD NOT FEEL HARASSED ESPECIALLY BY A CITY CONTRACTOR WHO MOWS LAWNS BECAUSE HE FEELS HE CAN INDISCRIMINANTLY YELL AT US. THE FACT THAT YOU ARE NOT AWARE OF THESE ISSUES BUT THE AMEND WAS RUSHED THROUGH WITHOUT PROPER REPRESENTATION WAS CONCERNING. PLEASE ALLOW OUR DOGS ON THE LEASH.
00:09:14.076: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS DAVID NEWMAN.
00:09:29.524: >> THANK YOU FOR HAVING US HERE. CARIN AND K.P. THE GATE WAS NOT BROKEN BY THIS CONTRACTOR. IT WAS BROKEN 10 OR 12 YEARS AGO. THAT'S SORT OF A SIDE ISSUE. BUT IN 25 YEARS, I HAVE NOT SEEN DAMAGE TO THE CEMETERY CAUSED BY DOGS. AND I HAVE, YOU KNOW, WALKED IN THERE WHEN THERE ARE THINGS THAT I FEEL ARE DRUG DEALS GOING DOWN. AND THERE ARE, YOU KNOW -- THERE ARE CONDOMS TO PICK UP SOME WEEKENDS. SO WE -- IF I WERE A MOURNER, AND I WENT THERE AND SAW CONDOMS AND BEER CANS, -- ALTHOUGH THEY WERE IMPORTED BEER CANS -- I WOULD NOT REALLY WANT TO SEE THAT IF I'M GOING TO A CEMETERY. SO I THINK IT'S AN ADVANTAGE TO HAVE PEOPLE WALKING THROUGH THERE WHO ARE NOT DOING ANYTHING NEFARIOUS. THERE IS GOING TO BE ANIMAL WASTE IN THERE, AS CARIN MENTIONED THERE ARE FOXES AND RACCOONS AND DEER AND R RABBITS. I'M NOT SURE THAT THAT'S REALLY AN ISSUE. YOU KNOW, I KNOW IT'S BEEN BROUGHT UP BY THIS CONTRACTOR, BUT I DON'T THINK THE CEMETERY IS REALLY COVERED IN ANIMAL WASTE. AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT SPECIES OF ANIMAL IT ALWAYS IS. I GUESS ALL I WOULD REALLY SAY IS THAT IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S WORKED FOR 25 YEARS. YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE BENEFITS OF CHANGING THIS RULE, VERSUS THE BENEFITS OF KEEPING IT. I THINK WE HAVE GONE OVER A FEW OF THOSE. THANK YOU.
00:11:08.323: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS ANDREW PIEKNIK.
00:11:17.132: >> HELLO, EVERYONE. SO I'M GLAD THAT MY NEIGHBORS HAD A CHANCE TO SPEAK UP ABOUT THIS WITH SORT OF THE FORTUITOUS PARSING OF THE RULE CHANGE A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO. I LIVE AT 711 ARGO DRIVE. IT'S LESS THAN A BLOCK FROM THE CEMETERY. I TOO OPPOSE THE ESCALATION OF CEMETERY RULES FROM THE CITYWIDE -- THE STANDARD CITYWIDE LEASH POLICY TO AN ALL-OUT BAN ON PETS. THERE ARE TONS OF REASONS TO KEEP THINGS AS THEY ARE. MY NEIGHBORS HAVE ITERATED MANY OF THEM. AND IF YOU -- BUT MAINLY, IF YOU EVER PLAN ON ENFORCING THE EXISTING RULE, IT WOULD TOTALLY NEGATE THE REASON FOR AN ESCALATED RULE. SO I'M ALSO TRYING TO SQUARE THE CAMPAIGN THAT I HEAR ON MLIVE FOLLOWING NEW COUNCIL PEOPLE, WITH PROVIDING QUALITY LOW-INCOME HOUSING FOR ANN ARBOR'S RESIDENTS. YOU KNOW, WE WANT TO SUPPORT RENTERS. WE WANT TO PROMOTE HIGHER DENSITY. AND NOT HAVING A YARD. THERE ARE MANY CONDOMINIUM, APARTMENT, LOW-INCOME HOUSING RESIDENTS THAT VISIT THIS PARK WITH THEIR DOGS. I'M NOT SURE THAT ADDING A TEN-MINUTE WALK WHICH MIGHT BE SUGGESTED LATER ON BASED ON THE MAP THAT I SAW POSTED, YOU KNOW, THAT'S 20 EXTRA MINUTES IF YOU ARE WORKING TWO JOBS, THAT MAYBE THEY JUST WON'T HAVE DOGS. SO I JUST -- I JUST WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT THAT AND THE 25 YEARS THAT -- THAT THIS REALLY HASN'T BEEN A PROBLEM. AND -- AND SEE REALLY WHAT MAKES THE MOST SENSE. THERE MIGHT BE SOME OTHER SOLUTIONS, BUT I KNOW THAT CHANGING THE LAW OR CHANGING THE RULES JUST DOESN'T SOUND LIKE ONE. THANK YOU.
00:13:22.824: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS RYAN HUGHES.
00:13:34.102: >> EVERYBODY ASSUMES THAT ROADS ARE INHERENTLY DANGEROUS, AND IT'S A FACT OF LIFE, BUT IT'S NOT A FACT OF LIFE. VISION ZERO GIVES US AN ALTERNATIVE. IF WE REDUCE VEHICLE SPEEDS, WE CAN MAKE CAR CRASHES LESS FREQUENT AND LESS DANGEROUS. WE HAVE THREE OPPORTUNITIES TODAY TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. DS-1, 2, AND 3, VOTE YES ON ALL OF THEM. SOME OF THE COUNCILMEMBERS PLANNING TO VOTE NO COMPLAIN THAT THEY ARE BEING CALLED ANTISCIENCE. THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF DS1, 2, AND 3, FOLLOWING THE ROAD DIET INFORMATION GUIDE WHICH WAS CREATED USING SCIENCE. HERE'S THE 72-PAGE DOCUMENT. AND IT'S GOT TWO PAGES OF REFERENCES IN THE BACK. ONE OF MY FAVORITE TITLES THAT'S REFERENCED IS IMPACTS ON CRASH FREQUENCIES AND CRASH RATES ASSESSED FOLLOWING A BEIJING APPROACH. THAT'S SO SCIENCE. I FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO WEAR A LAB COAT TO HEAR THE TITLE. I TELL YOU THE REASON THAT THEY ARE NOT SUPPORTING THESE. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI THINKS THESE RECONFIGURATIONS ARE NOT THE PRESSING PRIORITY FOR PEDESTRIAN SAFETY. OUR STAFF WHO WE HIRE FULL-TIME TO CONSIDER EXACTLY THIS ISSUE THINK THESE ARE, IN FACT, OF THE MOST PRESSING ISSUES AND THAT'S WHY THEY ARE RECOMMENDING THEM. WHAT IS THE BASIS FOR DISAGREEING WITH THEIR WORK AND WHAT DOES HE THINK IS THE MOST PRESSING PRIORITY AND WHY DOES HE THINK THAT? COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD, TALKING ABOUT THE ROUNDABOUT ON EARHART SAYS THAT SHE DOESN'T LIKE THE IDEA OF TRYING THIS OUT, BASED ON OUR BEST EDUCATED GUESSES OF WHAT'S THE BEST THING TO DO, AND THEN STUDYING THE AVAILABLE LITERATURE AND MAKING DETAILED OBSERVATIONS AND SEEING WHAT HAPPENS. THE METHODOLOGY SHE'S OPPOSING HERE HAS THE NAME, THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD. IN THE RECENT FIFTH AVENUE RECONSTRUCTION TEMPORARY PAVEMENT MARKINGS WERE PLACED, DETAILED OBSERVATIONS WERE MADE, AND ANALYSIS OF THE DATA SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS. WHEN THE FINAL LAYOUT WAS COMMITTED TO CONCRETE, THE RESULTS WERE WILDLY SUCCESSFUL. PREVIOUSLY LESS THAN 50% OF CARS STOPPED FOR PEDESTRIANS NOW OVER 90% DUE. SCIENCE WORKS AND THAT'S WHY WE LIKE IT! COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD SAYS SHE DOESN'T NEED TO LISTEN TO OUR STAFF, OUR CITIZEN VOLUNTEERS ON THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION OR TO THE GUIDELINES OF THE FEDERAL HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION. SHE WILL ONLY LISTEN TO A PARTICULAR STAFF MEMBER WITH PARTICULAR QUALIFICATIONS WHO CONVENIENTLY HASN'T BEEN HIRED YET. UNTIL THAT PERSON IS HIRED, COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD FEELS JUSTIFIED REFUSING TO ENGAGEMENT WITH THE ARGUMENTS BEING PRESENTED. THE PEOPLE CALLING THE COUNCILMEMBERS ANTISCIENCE, THE REASON THEY ARE DOING, THIS THE ARGUMENTS THEY ARE MAKING ARE NOT BACKED UP BY A LINE OF REASON AGATHA'S REPEATABLE OR INDEPENDENTLY FALSIFIABLE. JUST GUT FEELINGS AN HOT TAKES. THAT DOESN'T MAKE ME FEEL SAFE.
00:16:26.808: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. THE NEXT SPEAKER IS ERICA BRIGGS.
00:16:33.915: >> GOOD EVENING, MY NAME IS ERICA BRIGGS I'M SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE WASHTENAW BICYCLING AND WALKING COMMISSION. AND ON BEHALF OF THE 383 INDIVIDUALS WHO SIGNED OUR PETITION WHO YOU I SUSPECT HAS SEEN COME IN FRONT OF YOU, AND PASS OUT FOR THE LATEST NUMBER OF SIGNATURES AND COMMENTS AT THE END OF MY -- SO YOU MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE ALL OF THEM IN FRONT OF YOU. AS WE HEARD LAST WEEK, THAT COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD'S ACCELERATING PEDESTRIAN SAFETY EVENT, LOWERING VEHICLE SPEEDS AND CHANGING ROADWAYS IS CRITICAL. WE ALSO LEARNED THAT WE NEED TO UTILIZE MULTIPLE TACTICS AND WE NEED TO EMBRACE ROADWAY ROADWAY CONFIGURATIONS AND WE NEEDED TO DO THIS BY HAVING MORE IN THE PIPELINE THAN WE THINK ARE NECESSARY BECAUSE SOME WILL NOT DELIVER AS MUCH AS WE HAD HOPED. SO THAT'S WHY WE ARE IN FRONT OF YOU TONIGHT URGING TO YOU SUPPORT THESE THREE ROAD DIETS. WE KNOW THAT THESE ARE CRITICAL IMPROVEMENTS. WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S BEEN A LITTLE BIT OF CHAFFING ABOUT THE USE OF THE VERBIAGE AND WE STAND BY IT. WE THINK THIS IS PROVEN SCIENCE. WE ARE NOT JUST GOING ON A CUT INSTINCT. THIS IS PROVEN COUNTER -- SAFETY COUNTER MEASURES BY THE FEDERAL HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION. AND AS MR. HUGHES JUST MENTIONED, THERE'S A LOT OF -- THERE'S A LOT OF RESEARCH THAT'S GONE INTO THIS. AND THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF STAFF RESEARCH INTO THIS. MAKING SURE THAT THE ANALYSIS OF THESE THREE PARTICULAR ROADWAYS IN ANN ARBOR ARE ACTUALLY APPROPRIATE FOR ROAD DIETS. AND AFTER QUITE A BIT OF ANALYSIS BY YOUR OWN STAFF, THEY CONTINUE TO SUGGEST THAT THESE ARE APPROPRIATE FOR OUR COMMUNITY. NOW, I HEARD LAST SPRING THAT THE REASON THAT COUNCIL WANTED TO HAVE MORE OF THESE ROAD DIETS COME IN FRONT OF YOU WAS SO THAT YOU COULD HAVE MORE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT, AND WE ARE HERE. YOU KNOW, WE HAVE SIGNATURES. WE'RE MAKING SURE THAT THE COMMUNITY KNOWS. WE UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WANT TO HAVE A ROBUST CONVERSATION AROUND THAT. BUT WE'RE HOPING THAT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU ARE GOING TO VOTE NO ON THESE PROJECTS THAT UNDER FRONT OF YOU TONIGHT. PLEASE REMEMBER WHAT THE IMPACT IS OF LOWERING ROADWAY SPEEDS. A PEDESTRIAN HIT BY A CAR TRAVELING 20 MILES PER HOUR HAS A 10% CHANCE OF DYING. WHEN A CAR TRAVELING 30 MILES PER HOUR, 50%. AND A CAR TRAVELING AT 40 MILES PER HOUR, 90%. WE NEED TO LOWER SPEEDS IF WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT THE VISION ZERO, BUT THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT PEDESTRIAN SAFETY. THIS IS THE GREATEST BENEFITS ARE GOING TO GO TO THE MOTORING PUBLIC. WE KNOW THAT THE OVERALL CRASH REDUCTION IS BETWEEN 19 AND 47% ACCORDING TO THE FEDERAL HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION. THE PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO BENEFIT ON EARHART ARE THOSE RESIDENTS OF GLA GLACIER HILLS. THEY MAY NOT REALIZE THAT THEY ARE GOING TO BENEFIT, BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE DATA, YOU CAN ACT ON THEIR BEHALF. THANK YOU.
00:19:39.767: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS LINH SONG.
00:19:49.310: >> GOOD EVENING, COUNCIL. MY NAME IS LINH SONG, A RESIDENT OF WARD 2. I'M HERE TO SPEAK AND ADVOCATE ON THREE RESOLUTIONS IN FRONT OF YOU. THEY DO NOT SPEAK DIRECTLY TO PEDESTRIAN SAFETY BUT DEFINITELY SUPPORT PEDESTRIAN SAFETY. THIS IS IMPORTANT TO ME, BECAUSE ONE REASON WHY WE MOVED TO WARD 2 WAS HOW ACCESSIBLE IT IS. OVER THE YEARS WE HAVE SEEN ROAD IMPROVEMENTS INCLUDING SPEED BUMPS INSTALLED IN FRONT OF OUR NEIGHBORHOOD PARK. THIS IS WHERE OUR COMMUNITY HAS HOSTED A  MEMORIAL DAY PARADE SINCE 1960s. IT WAS A JOY AND WONDER, I JOKINGLY THANKED OBAMA WHEN REALLY I SHOULD HAVE THANKED CITY COUNCIL AND STAFF. WHEN MY SON WAS AT KING SCHOOL, I MANAGED TO WORK WITH THE SCHOOLS AND THE CITY SUCCESSFULLY ADVOCATING FOR PARKING ALONGSIDE ONLY ONE SIDE OF THE STREET ON KING. AND ANY SCHOOL PARENT CAN TESTIFY HOW DIFFICULT SCHOOL DROPOFFS ARE UNLESS IT'S A COORDINATED EFFORT, TO FORGE ACTUAL PATHS TO AND FROM SCHOOL. WHAT I LEARNED IS IT'S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE TO HAVE PRODUCTIVE COMMUNITY CONVERSATIONS AROUND ROAD IMPROVEMENTS AND PEDESTRIAN SAFETY, ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY CONCERN OUR CHILDREN. GIVEN THAT WE HAVE THE POTENTIAL AND DEMONSTRATED WORK TOWARDS THIS END, I WAS SHOCKED TO SEE COUNCIL WOMAN GRISWOLD'S RECENT QUOTE ON MLIVE IF. I SEE A PEDESTRIAN AND CARS BEHIND ME, I DO NOT STOP. I SLOW DOWN SO I'M NOT GOING TO HIT THEM, BUT I DON'T WANT TO STOP BECAUSE I CAN'T CONTROL THOSE OTHER CARS. I WOULD LIKE TO ASK COUNCILWOMAN GRISWOLD TO PLEASE STOP FOR PEDESTRIANS' SUGGEST THAT THEY ARE TAIL LIGHTS HELP TO SIGNAL STOPS TO DRIVERS BEHIND HER. I WILL THOUGHT OF COUNCILWOMAN GRISWOLD, WHILE VISITING LANCASTER, PENNSYLVANIA, THIS WEEKEND WHERE I HAVE SEEN SIMILAR CROSSWALK SIGNS. SURELY IN THE MENNONITES CAN YIELD THEIR HORSE AND BUGGIES TO PEDESTRIANS, THEN WE CAN DO THE SAME IN THE MOST EDUCATED CITY IN AMERICA. I HOPE COUNCIL CONSIDERS HOW OTHER COMMUNITIES AROUND THE COUNTRY HAVE MANAGED TO MEET THE NEEDS OF PEDESTRIANS, BIKERS AND DRIVERS WITHOUT SACRIFICING ONE'S WELL-BEING FOR THE OTHER. I HAVE MET CITY TRAFFIC ENGINEERS AT COMMUNITY MEETINGS AND HAVE READ THE REPORTS. IT'S REASONABLE TO ASK FOR PAINT AND PLASTIC DELINEATORS THAT WOULD REDUCE CRASHES BY 50% AT EARHART AND GLACIER ROAD INTERVICTIMMIONS. THE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TRAVER AND GREEN SEEM WELL REASONED AND WELLED. WELCOMED. I URGE THE PEOPLE TO READ THE REPORTS SUBMITTED TO COUNCIL AND TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION. I KNOL KNOW SOME HAVE SIGNED THS SUMMER READING TO THEIR CHILDREN. THOSE FAMILIES ALSO PLAN TO ATTEND FUTURE COMMISSION AND COUNCIL MEETINGS TOGETHER ONCE THEY RETURN FROM VACATION. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR TIME AND COMMITMENT TO OUR CITY. I LOOK FORWARD TO MEETING AGAIN.
00:22:30.705: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS MATTHEW CATANZARITE. MY APOLOGIES.
00:22:47.622: >> ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU, EVERYBODY. I'M HERE TONIGHT TO TALK ON BEHALF OF THE WASHTENAW COUNTY WALKING AND BICYCLING COALITION. I'M A BOARD MEMBER WITH ERICA AS WELL, IN FAVOR OF SUPPORTING THESE ROAD RECONFIGURATION FOR TRAVER, EARHART AND GREEN ROADS. IT GOES HAND IN HAND WITH PROJECT ZERO VISION. BETWEEN NOW AND THAT TIME, THERE'S BEEN LOTS OF COMMUNITY STAFF HAVE PROVIDED AMPLE CRASH DATA AND FLOW DATA UTILIZING PUBLIC MEETING AND ONLINE SURVEYS TO OBTAIN INPUT. OPINIONS OF NEIGHBORS IMPACTED AREAS HAVE BEEN PROVIDED AND SUMMARIZED AND ALL SEEM TO SHOW THAT THE PUBLIC DOES DESIRE REDUCED SPEEDS AND SAFER CROSSINGS. KEY ELEMENTS TO -- KEY COMPONENTS TO VISION ZERO, REDUCING FATAL AND SERIOUS CRASHES. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVES OF THESE ROAD CONFIGURATIONS IS TO REDUCE SPEEDS AND HAVE SHORTER AND SAFER CROSSINGS AND PEDESTRIAN AND DRIVER INTERACTIONS. THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING. SPEED IS A FACTOR IN THE SAFETY OF THESE ROADS. AS MENTIONED EARLIER, PEDESTRIAN DEATH AT 20 MILES PER HOUR, 10%. AND 30 MILES PER HOUR 50% CHANCE AND GOING TO 40 MILES PER HOUR, 90% FATALITY BETWEEN DRIVER AND PEDESTRIAN INTERACTIONS. ADDRESSING SOME OF THE CITY COUNCIL CERTAINS RESPONSIBLE FOR DELAYING THESE PROJECTS, I HAVE HEARD INCLUDE THE COST AND FROM MY UNDERSTANDING FOR GREEN AND TRAVER DRIVES, AS MERELY THE PAINT WILL BE APPLIED TO THE ROAD. THIS' NO EXTRA COST ASSOCIATED WITH THE ROAD RECONFIGURATION AND EARHART, I HEARD SOMEWHERE IN THE RANGE OF $40,000 WHICH IS WELL WORTH IT CONSIDERING THE BENEFIT TO THE PEDESTRIANS AND MOTORISTS ALONG THAT ROADWAY. PUBLIC FEEDBACK IS A CONCERN. THAT'S HOW IT GOT PUSHED BACK TO THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION LAST MONTH. AND I'M HAPPY THAT THAT HAPPENED. IN THIS CASE, I FEEL THAT THE PUBLIC FEEDBACK WAS VALUE ADDED. I MEAN, WHO KNOWS BETTER THAN WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN IN THESE COMMUNITIES THAN THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITIES THEMSELVES. RESIDENTS ARE MOSTLY IN FAVOR OF RE CONFIGURING TH THESE ROADS AD REDUCING DRIVER SPEED IN THESE ROADS. IS THIS THE BEST USE OF THE COUNCIL'S MO MONEY AND RESOURCE? IT'S TO MAKE A POSITIVE IMPACT TOWARDS VISION ZERO. NOT IN A FEW MONTHS, NOT NEXT YEAR, NOT IN THE FIVE-YEAR PLAN BUT INSTANTLY. EARHART IS TEMPORARILY AND CAN BE CHANGED AS NEEDED. AN EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY TO CONDUCT A BEFORE AND AFTER STUDY WHICH IS A CONCERN OF MANY COUNCILMEMBERS, PARTICULARLY ALONG EARHART. THREE SCHOOLS ALONG THAT ROAD. RESIDENTS ARE IN FAVOR OF REDUCING THE SPEEDS OF DRIVERS. SLOWER SPEEDS, FEWER ACCIDENTS. FINAL WORDS BY DEBATING THE MINUTIA, YOU ARE DELATING THE EFFORT -- YOU ARE DELAYING THE EFFORTS IN VISION ZERO.
00:25:48.736: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
00:25:50.037: >> THANK YOU.
00:25:50.771: >> Mayor Taylor: OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS ALEXANDRA LINDSTROM.
00:25:59.080: >> I'M HERE TODAY AS PART OF THE SUNRISE MOVEMENT AND TO ASK ANN ARBOR CITY COUNCIL TO DECLARE A CLIMATE EMERGENCY. I REPRESENT A GENERATION BATTLE ANXIETY ABOUT WHAT OUR FUTURE MIGHT LOOK LIKE. TO PREPARE FOR LIVES AND CAREERS THAT MIGHT COME TO A GRINDING HALT IN THE CHAOS THAT SCIENTISTS WARN OF. EVERY DAY WE WAKE UP TO VIOLENCE, LOSS AND FEAR. FROM LOCAL FLOODING ERODING OUR ROADS TO FIRES LEVELING CITIES, THE CLIMATE CRISIS IMPACTS EVERY CORNER OF OUR PLANET. IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT ECO ANXIETY HAS EMERGED AS A WIDELY USED NEW TERM AMONG MY GENERATION, AS SYSTEMS AROUND US COLLAPSE. WE HAVE TAKEN TO THE STREETS AND TO POLITICAL OFFICES TO DEMAND CHANGE. THOUSANDS OF US GATHERED IN DETROIT LAST WEEK FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY DEBATES WITH LABOR AND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES TO DEMAND THAT CANDIDATES BACK THE GREEN NEW DEAL. HUNDREDS OF US ARE PUTTING OUR BODIES ON THE LINE, AND TRYING TO GET ATTENTION TO THIS CRISIS WHEN IT FEELS LIKE OUR CRIES ARE FALLING ON DEAF EARS. I AND 150 OTHER YOUTH WERE ARRESTED FOR SITTING IN NANCY PELOSI'S OFFICE LAST YEAR, WITH A SIMPLE REQUEST THAT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY CREATES A PLAN. JUST RECENTLY WE HAVE EXPERIENCED A RECORD-BREAKING HEAT WAVE WITH INTENSE ART FAIR STORMS AND WE BREATHES IN WILDFIRE SPOKE DRIFTING FROM CANADA. OUR FORMERS WERE UNABLE TO PLANT ON TIME THIS YEAR, DUE TO HEAVY RAINFALL. I HAVE WORKED AS A LIFEGUARD FOR SEVERAL SUMMERS IN THE CITY. I HAVE WATCHED STORMS ROLL IN COUNTLESS TIMES. THESE ARE NOTHING LIKE I HAVE SEEN BEFORE. WE'RE FACING LOCAL CHANGES WHERE UTTERLY UNPREPARED FOR AND INCREASING RISKS AS THE FOSSIL FUEL INFRASTRUCTURE AROUND US CONTINUES TO GROW. AND BRIDGE THE OWNER OF LINE FIVE JUST SAW A FATAL PIPELINE EXPLOSION IN KENTUCKY LAST WEEK. YET WE ARE NOT SEEING LEADERS AT ANY SCALE OF GOVERNMENT TREAT THIS CRISIS AS THE EMERGENCY THAT IT IS. THE PARIS AGREEMENT HAS COMPROMISED TARGETS AND LACKS ENFORCEMENT MEASURES. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT STALLS WHILE THE REGULATIONS ARE ROLLED BACK EVERY DAY. ONLY A HANDFUL OF STATES ARE TAKING ACTION. THE TRANSFORMATIVE CHANGE WE NEED HAS YET TO FORMALIZE. IT PLANS TO FILL IN THE GAPS OF FEDERAL AND STATE INACTION. ANN ARBOR IS UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO INTERVENE. AS HOME TO A LEADING UNIVERSITY AND INNOVATIVE START-UPS AND MANY NONPROFITS WE HAVE THE HECKUAL AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO PAVE THE WAY TO A BETTER FUTURE. WE CAN RISE TO THE CALL TO BE LEADERS IN THE BEST AND ACKNOWLEDGE OUR ROLE IN THE CREATION OF THIS CRISIS AND THE POTENTIAL TO BRING FORTH SOLUTIONS OR WE CAN SIT IDLY BY. I ASK ANN ARBOR TO DECLARE A CLIMATE EMERGENCY TODAY FOR MY GENERATION.
00:28:53.454: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. [ APPLAUSE ] OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS ROBIN TUCK.
00:29:04.365: >> HELLO. MY NAME IS ROBIN TUCK AND I'M A MEMBER OF WARD 5 AND I'M ALSO HERE TO ASK CITY COUNCIL TO DECLARE A STATE OF CLIMATE EMERGENCY. ON JULY 19th, YOU MIGHT BE FAMILIAR, WE HAD ONE OF THE SEVERE STORMS THAT SHE MENTIONED, AND A POWER LINE CAME DOWN AND LIT A CAR ON FIRE. THAT WAS A BLOCK AWAY FROM MY HOUSE. AND I COULD SEE THE FLAMES AND I COULD LISTEN TO THE TRANSFORMERS BLOW FROM MY BACK PORCH. IT'S NOT THE KIND OF NORMAL STORMS I'M USED TO. WE ALSO LOST POWER AS MUCH OF ANN ARBOR AND THAT SAME STORM SEVERELY IMPACTED ARTISTS AND VISITORS TO THE ART FAIR, WHICH IS ASSUMINGLY LOSING REVENUE FOR THE CITY AND DAMAGING ONE OF OUR CULTURAL TOUCHSTONES. AND THIS, OF COURSE, IS ONLY THE BEGINNING. THE PROBLEMS WILL CONTINUE TO GROW IF WE DO NOT OVERT THIS CRISIS. THE THREATS TO OUR HEALTH AND SAFETY WILL BECOME MORE OVERWHELMING AND COSTLY TO MITIGATE. THIS MUST BE CONFRONTED ON ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT. WE ARE SEEING THE DANGEROUS EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CRISIS IN ANN ARBOR. I STRONGLY URGE THE CITY COUNCIL TO DECLARE A STATE OF FINANCIAL EMERGENCY FOLLOWING THE STEPS OF U.K. AND NEW YORK CITY AND KALAMAZOO. THIS WOULD HELP TO RALLY OUR COMMUNITY TO FIGHT FOR A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE AND PUSH BACK ONE OF THE MOST SERIOUS THREATS OF OUR TIME. THANK YOU.
00:30:19.039: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. ARE THERE COMMUNICATIONS TODAY FROM COUNCIL? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
00:30:29.016: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I WOULD LIKE TO ANNOUNCE THAT THE QUARTERLY CARD MEETING IS TOMORROW MORNING FROM 10 TO 12 A.M. AT THE WESTERN WASHTENAW SERVICE CENTER AND IN THE BASEMENT CLASSROOM THIS TIME. AND THAT'S THE QUARTERLY JOINT UPDATE WITH EAGLE, FORMERLY D.E.Q. AND THE CARD GROUP. THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING INTERESTING HAPPENING THERE AND WE WILL GET THIS GELMAN PLUME TAKEN CARE OF SOONER RATHER THAN LATER. THINGS ARE MOVING FORWARD ON THAT. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK EVERYBODY, ESPECIALLY SOME FOLKS HERE AT THE TABLE, ESPECIALLY HOWARD LAZARUS, FOR HELPING WITH THE PRIDE FESTIVAL THIS WEEKEND. IT WAS A GOOD TIME WAS HAD BY ALL, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF SOME POOR WOMAN WHO I HEARD FELL THROUGH A BROKEN SEWER GRATE IN THE PARKING LOT UP TO HER KNEE. I DON'T WANT TO DAMPEN THE FESTIVITIES, OTHER THAN, THAT I WILL THOUGHT IT WAS A GREAT TIME AND MR. LAZARUS, I APPRECIATE YOU HELPING OUT WITH SOME OF THE SIDE EVENTS AND THE STREET MANAGEMENT AND THINGS LIKE THAT. IT MEANT A LOT TO THE SPONSORS OF THIS EVENT. WE HAD SOME GREAT SPONSORS FOR IT THIS YEAR AND I THINK IT'S BIGGER AND BETTER THAN EVER. IT'S ANOTHER GREAT PART ABOUT BEING IN ANN ARBOR. SO YEAH, THAT'S IT. THANK YOU.
00:31:41.989: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
00:31:42.890: >> Councilmember Bannister:  I JUST HAD A FEW UPDATES. THINGS TO GO A MILE A MINUTE FOR ALL OF COUNCIL, I'M SURE. I WANTED TO GIVE AN ANNOUNCEMENT TO ANY OF THE BARTON DRIVE SIDEWALK GAP PEOPLE THAT COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER AND I ARE HERE TO HELP THEM NAVIGATE THROUGH THE PRO E SIS. SO IF YOU ARE ONE OF THE BARTON DRIVE SIDEWALK GAP HOMEOWNERS, PLEASE REACH OUT TO US, IF YOU FEEL THE NEED. OTHER THINGS, I WANT TO THANK THOSE TWO YOUNG WOMEN FROM THE CLIMATE MOBILIZATION COMMITTEE. WE DID MEET THE OTHER DAY. KEN GASHER HELPED TO SET IT UP AND RITA MITCHELL WAS THERE AND WE HAD AN INTERESTING AND LIVELY MEETING AND SO I ENCOURAGE COUNCIL TO LOOK CLOSER AT DECLARING A CLIMATE EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN, AND PART OF IT WILL BE -- PART OF THE PROPOSAL IS A NET ZERO GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS CITYWIDE BY 2025. WHICH IS A HUGE ACCELERATION BUT IT MAY BE WARRANTED. SO THANKS TO ALLEY AND ROBIN. STAY TUNED FOR MORE UPDATES ON THAT. WE ALSO HEARD FROM SOME OF OUR LOCAL MARIJUANA DISPENSERRIES AND THEY ARE HELPING THE ATTORNEY'S OFFICE AND THE COMMUNITY SERVICES AREA AND COUNCILMEMBERS WORK THROUGH THE MARIJUANA SOCIAL USE CLUBS ISSUE. WE WILL TALK TO THE FOOD GATHERS AND THE GOOD THEY DO FOR THE CITY AND THE THINGS THEY ARE DOING FOR COMPOSTING. AND SO WHEN THEY CAN'T USE ALL OF THE FOOD THAT THEY GET, BUT THEY PAY TO COMPOST ABOUT A THIRD OF IT. SO WE'LL HAVE A MEETING ON FRIDAY TO TALK ABOUT OTHER OPTIONS ON THAT. AND FOR THOSE OF YOU CONCERNED ABOUT INDUSTRIES, WE ARE THE NATURAL FEATURES SUBCOMMITTEE OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION IS ACTIVELY WORKING AND WE'RE MOBILIZED AND WE'RE SCHEDULING MORE MEETING TO TALK ABOUT PROTECTING OUR NATURAL FEATURES AND THE NATURAL CAPITAL. AND LASTLY, THE WASHTENAW COUNTY ROAD COMMISSION BASED ON MANY OF OUR EFFORTS HAS AGREED TO STOP SPRAYING HERBICIDES ON THE COUNTY ROADS AND SO WE ARE USING THIS MOMENTUM TO FURTHER LOOK INTO PARTITIONING STATE OF MICHIGAN TO CHANGE OUR PESTICIDE RESTRICTIONS SO THAT WE COULD BE MORE LIKE PORTLAND, MAINE, OR CITIES IN MARYLAND WHERE WE CAN LOCALLY HAVE STRICTER REGULATIONS THAN ARE ALLOWED AT THE STATE LEVEL. SO ALL SORTS OF GOOD THINGS ARE GOING ON FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AND JUST ONE LAST THING I ALMOST FORGOT, THE CENTER OF THE CITY GROUP HAS STARTED TO MEET, AND LIBRARY GREEN, THE CENTER OF THE CITY TASK FORCE AND LIBRARY GREEN CONSEVERRANCEY MET YESTERDAY AND WE WANT EVERYONE TO HELP ACTIVATE THE LIBRARY LOT BLOCK AND LOOK TO SCHEDULE YOUR EVENTS ON THAT LOCATION AND ENJOY THE CENTER OF THE CITY. THANK YOU APARTMENT.
00:35:17.271: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
00:35:18.505: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. I WANT TO THANK OUR CLERK'S OFFICE FOR -- FOR THE HIGHER THAN AVERAGE VOLUME NOW THAT IT'S E EASIER TO VOTE ABSENTEE. THE FEEDBACK I HAVE RECEIVED FROM RESIDENTS IS GLOWING AND POSITIVE. THANK YOU FOR THAT. I KNOW IT'S MADE IT MUCH EASIER FOR MANY OF OUR RESIDENTS DURING THE SUMMERTIME TO BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ELECTION THAT WE ARE HAVING TOMORROW. AND IF YOU HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET OUT AND VOTE I CERTAINLY DO ENCOURAGE YOU TO GO OUT AND SUPPORT HIGH POINT SCHOOL. IT'S BEEN ANOTHER TERRIBLE WEEK IN OUR COUNTRY AND I WAS THINKING WHAT IS SOMETHING POSITIVE THAT I CAN DO, IT COULD BE TO HELP SOME OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE KIDS IN OUR COMMUNITY. SO I HOPE THAT YOU WILL GO OUT AND SUPPORT THEM TOMORROW.
00:36:06.853: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER COMMUNICATION FROM COUNCIL? COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
00:36:10.924: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE WHO HAS REACHED OUT AND CONTINUED THE DISCUSSION REGARDING PEDESTRIAN SAFETY AND VISION ZERO. I WANT TO ESPECIALLY THANK EVERYONE WHO CAME TO THE COMMUNITY CONVERSATION LAST WEEK. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK THE VISION ZERO COMMUNITY ADVISORY COMMITTEE MEMBERS, HOWEVER, I DON'T HAVE THAT LIST AND SO I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT STAFF PROVIDE THE LIST OF THOSE MEMBERS SO THAT I'M AWARE OF THEM AND CAN THANK THEM. I HAVE A FEW RESOLUTIONS-RELATED ITEMS. THE FIRST ONE IS A RESOLUTION THAT I AM WORKING ON TO LOOK AT ANY ON-SITE CHANGES ON PROPERTY, TRAFFIC FLOW CHANGES THAT NEGATIVELY IMPACT TRAFFIC FLOW ON OUR STREETS. ONE OF THE EXAMPLES IS HURON HIGH SCHOOL, WHERE AFTER 50 YEARS, THEY CHANGED THE TRAFFIC FLOW AND THE RESULT WAS THAT WE DOUBLED THE AMOUNT OF VEHICULAR TRAFFIC THAT GOES THROUGH THE CROSSWALK WHERE WE HAD A PEDESTRIAN FATALITY ALMOST THREE YEARS AGO. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO COORDINATE BETTER AND MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE NOT NEGATIVELY IMPACTING OUR ROADWAY SAFETY. NUMBER TWO, IS A RESOLUTION FOR THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR TO ADOPT THE LANGUAGE THAT'S IN THE HOUSE BILL THAT WOULD ESTABLISH A STATE CROSSWALK LAW, WHICH IS SIMILAR TO THE LANGUAGE OF GRAND RAPIDS AND TRAVERSE CITY. THERE IS NO COMMUNITY IN THE WORLD THAT HAS THE LANGUAGE IN OUR LOCAL CROSSWALK ORDINANCE. KALAMAZOO ADOPTED OUR LOCAL CROSSWALK ORDINANCE LANGUAGE PLUS A PEDESTRIAN MUST STOP BEFORE ENTERING A CROSSWALK. WE HAVE PEOPLE STOPPING FOR PEDESTRIANS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, NOT BECAUSE OF A LAW, BUT BECAUSE THE CROSSWALKS ARE SAFE FOR PEDESTRIANS TO CROSS AND FOR DRIVERS TO STOP. THAT REQUIRES A TREMENDOUS INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE. IT'S SOMETHING THAT I HAVE BEEN WORKING ON, AND WE HAVE TO REFINE OUR WORK BECAUSE WHILE WE ARE SPENDING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS MORE IN PEDESTRIAN INFRASTRUCTURE, UNLIKE NEW YORK CITY AND GRAND RAPIDS, WHERE THEY HAVE DECREASED THEIR CRASH RATE, WE HAVE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED OUR PEDESTRIAN CRASH RATE EVEN THOUGH WE ARE SPENDING MILLIONS MORE IN FUNDING. NUMBER THREE, I WOULD LIKE TO A RESOLUTION, IF NECESSARY, TO HAVE THE CITY SPECT ALL OF OUR SEWER GRATES AFTER THE -- INSPECT ALL OF OUR SEWER GRATES AFTER THE UNFORTUNATE ACCIDENT THAT OCCURRED ON SATURDAY. I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THERE IS AT LEAST ONE CCLICK FIX OR A2FIX-IT IN FOR THAT GRATE SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET THAT REPAIRED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. NUMBER FOUR, A RESOLUTION, AN AMENDMENT TO WHAT I BELIEVE IS CHAPTER 40, 3.14, WHICH IS THE ORDINANCE REGARDING VEGETATION, MAINLY ON THE PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY BUT ALSO ON PUBLIC PROPERTY. I WOULD LIKE IT TO BE MORE POLLINATOR FRIENDLY. IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A WILDFLOWER GARDEN, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO IT. BUT AT THE SAME TIME, WE NEED TO PROACTIVELY ENFORCE OVERGROWN VEGETATION. I WAS ON MY BIKE TODAY. I'M GLAD I HAD MY HELMET. IT PROTECTED ME FROM THE VEGETATION THAT WAS HANGING OVER THE SIDEWALK. I DIDN'T GET IN A CRASH BUT I WAS GLAD I HAD MY HELMET ON. WE NEED TO BE PROACTIVELY ENFORCING OVERGROWN VEGETATION. IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD, WE HAVE SCHOOL CROSSWALKS WHERE THE VEGETATION IS A WALL 6 TO 8 FEET TALL. EVERY YEAR I PUT IN CCLICK TICKET AND IT GETS TAKEN CARE OF AND THE NEXT YEAR, IT'S RIGHT UP THERE AT 8 FEET AGAIN. WE GOT TO BE PROACTIVE. WE'VE GOT TO MAINTAIN CLEAR SIGHT DISTANCE. AND LASTLY ON SEPTEMBER 17th, I WOULD LIKE TO ADD TO THE AGENDA A RESOLUTION TO SEND A LETTER TO THE GOVERNOR TO ESTABLISH AN EPA SUPERFUND SITE WITH THE DIOXANE PLUME. WE ALONG WITH SOME OF MY COUNCILMEMBERS, WE UNANIMOUSLY PASSED A RESOLUTION TO EXPLORE THAT OPTION. WE WILL BE MEETING AGAIN ALL FOUR UNITS OF GOVERNMENT WITH CONGRESSWOMAN DEBBIE DINGLE ON SEPTEMBER 12th. I WANT TO PUT THAT ON THE SEPTEMBER 17th AGENDA AS A PLACEHOLDER SO THAT WE DON'T LOSE ANY TIME. SORRY IT TOOK SO LONG, BUT I THINK THAT WE ARE OFF SUMMER VACATION AND IT'S TIME TO GET BACK TO WORK.
00:41:25.138: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER COMMUNICATION FROM COUNCIL? WE HAVE BEFORE US TODAY, A CONSENT AGENDA. MAY I HAVE A MOTION TO APPROVE THE CONSENT AGENDA. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER NELSON, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM. DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR. [CHORUS OF AYES] ALL OPPOSED IN THE CONSENT AGENDA IS APPROVED WITH 11 COUNCILMEMBERS PRESENT, ALL VOTING IN THE AFFIRMATIVE, THUS SATISFYING THE EIGHT VOTE REQUIREMENT WITH RESPECT TO CA-12 AND CA-15. AND CA-8. WE NOW COME TO A PUBLIC HEARING.
00:42:05.779: >> Councilmember Bannister:  I HAD A QUESTION ON CA-15. JUST A QUESTION ON IT. IS THAT OUT OF ORDER?
00:42:11.217: >> Mayor Taylor: IT HAS BEEN COMPLETED. CAN YOU RUN THAT QUESTION LATER?
00:42:13.920: >> Councilmember Bannister: YEP.
00:42:15.455: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. WE NOW COME TO PUBLIC HEARINGS. PUBLIC HEARINGS ARE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO SPEAK TO THE COUNCIL ABOUT MATTERS OF COMMUNITY INTEREST. TO SPEAK AT A PUBLIC HEARING, YOU NEED NOT TO HAVE SIGNED UP IN ADVANCE BUT YOUR SPEECH MUST RELATE TO THE SPECIFIC ITEM ON THE AGENDA. SPEAKERS HAVE THREE MINUTES IN WHICH TO SPEAK. SO PLEASE PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE TIME CLOCK. AS A MATTER OF COURTESY, WE MAY HAVE ONLY ONE PERSON SPEAKING AT A TIME. AND FINALLY IF YOU REQUIRE ASSISTANCE IN SPEAKING BEFORE COUNCIL, WE WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO PROVIDE IT TO YOU. PUBLIC HEARING NUMBER ONE, RESOLUTION TO APPROVE THE WILSON-BARRY ANNEXATION, .5 ACRES 614 RIVERVIEW S. THERE ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING? SEEING NO ONE THIS PUBLIC HEARING IS CLOSED. WE HAVE BEFORE US THE REGULAR SESSION MEETING MINUTES OF JULY 15, 2019, MAY I HAVE A MOTION TO APPROVE THE MINUTES. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRAND, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER SMITH. DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? THEY ARE APPROVED. C-1, AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND SECTION 5.15, TABLE 5-15, AND SECTION 5.16.6 OF CHAPTER 55, UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE OF THE TITLE V OF THE CODE OF THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR, OFFICE DISTRICT PERMITTED USES ACCESSORIES RESTAURANT? BAR,/FOOD SERVICE USE SPECIFIC STANDARDS. MOVED BY LUMM AND SECONDED BY SMITH. DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER NELSON?
00:43:52.152: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I JUST HAVE A QUESTION FROM STAFF. WHEN WE GET A MEMO ABOUT ITEMS LIKE THIS, THAT HAVE HISTORY, I ALWAYS TRY TO BIG BACK TO THE ORIGINAL MEETING MINUTES OF WHERE THEY BEGAN AND I SAW IN THE ORIGINAL PLANNING COMMISSION MEETINGS THAT THIS -- THE ORIGINAL PLANNING COMMISSION MEETING IN MARCH, IT ORIGINATED FROM A PETITION FROM A DEVELOPER IN TOWN, AND I WAS JUST CURIOUS IF SOMEBODY ON STAFF COULD EXPLAIN TO ME THE PROCESS OF SOMEONE PETITIONING TO GET SOMETHING ON THE PLANNING COMMISSION AGENDA. I WAS JUST CURIOUS WHAT THAT PROCESS LOOKS LIKE IF SOMEBODY COULD EXPLAIN IT TO ME.
00:44:23.750: >> Councilmember Ackerman: I'M HAPPY TO TAKE A WHACK AT IT WHILE STAFF COMES UP. IN ORDER TO PUSH ANY REZONING FORWARD, THERE'S A FEW MEANS THROUGH WHICH THAT CAN START. ONE OPTION IS A RESOLUTION FROM CITY COUNCIL WHICH COUNCILMEMBER SMITH DID IN THE CASE OF THE AREA NEAR WEST DAVIS, FOR EXAMPLE. THE OTHER IS STAFF INITIATED AMENDMENT TO THE UDC AND THEN THE THIRD IS ANY MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC IS ACTUALLY ABLE TO SUBMIT A PETITION TO CHANGE OUR ZONING IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.
00:44:56.249: >> Councilmember Nelson: THANK YOU. I WAS AWARE OF THAT. MY QUESTION WAS WHETHER THERE'S A FORMAL PROCESS FOR SIFTING AMONG THE VARIOUS REQUESTS FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. AS AN EXAMPLE, I WOULD OFFER THAT THERE ARE MANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO WOULD LIKE, FOR INSTANCE, THE PLANNING COMMISSION TO DISCUSS REGULATION OF SHORT-TERM RENTALS AND THEY ARE REACHING OUT TO US AND EMAILING US AND I'M TRYING TO GET IT ON THE AGENDA AND I'M SORT OF -- ANYWAY. SO MY QUESTION IS TO STAFF, IN TERMS OF THE FORMAL PROCESS FOR A REGULAR CITIZEN TO GET SOMETHING ON THE AGENDA FOR THE PLANNING COMMISSION. SO I -- YES, I APPRECIATE THAT MEMBERS OF COUNCIL CAN GET THINGS ON THE AGENDA. THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE IT.
00:45:36.689: >> THANK YOU. ANYONE IS -- BY CODE, NIP IS PERMITTED TO SUBMIT A PETITION TO AMEND THE TEXT. NOT ALL COMMUNITIES ALLOW THIS, BUT WE DO. AND THEN WHEN THAT IS SUBMITTED, IT GOES TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION'S ORDINANCE REVISION COMMITTEE TO PRIORITIZE AND THEY DECIDE IF IT SHOULD MOVE THROUGH IMMEDIATELY OR IF IT SHOULD PUT INTO THE -- SOMEWHERE FURTHER DOWN THE WORK PROGRAM.
00:46:01.581: >> Councilmember Nelson: OKAY.
00:46:07.020: >> Mayor Taylor: I GUESS COUNCILMEMBER NELSON STILL HAS THE FLOOR.
00:46:09.656: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I WILWILLCEDE THE FLOOR TO COUNCIR HAYNER.
00:46:20.633: >> Councilmember Hayner:  IS THIS WHERE YOU HAVE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF PETITIONS?
00:46:25.338: >> NO, YOU CAN WRITE DOWN THE EXACT WORDING THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO CHANGE OR YOU CAN PUT FORTH A TOPIC THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDRESSED.
00:46:31.744: >> Councilmember Hayner:  AND I THINK IF I READ THE MINUTES RIGHT, THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED IN THIS CASE WHERE THEY BROUGHT THE EXACT -- A PETITIONER BROUGHT THE EXACT WORDING THEY WANTED? AND THEN THROUGH THE PROCESS SOMEHOW, THE STAFF TOOK A LOOK AT THOSE POTENTIAL CHANGES AND THEN DECIDED TO BROADEN THAT IN THIS CASE. IS THAT ACCURATE?
00:46:48.928: >> YES. WELL, NOT SO MUCH STAFF. THE ORDINANCE REVISIONS COMMITTEE AND THE PLANNING COMMISSION ASKED FOR THEM TO BE BROADENED.
00:46:55.134: >> Councilmember Hayner:  OH, OKAY. [ OFF MICROPHONE COMMENT [ PRESIDENT CLINTON. COMMENT.>> Councilmember Hayner, ALL RIGHT.
00:47:09.182: >> Mayor Taylor: COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN.
00:47:10.316: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES, THE ORIGINAL PETITION WAS REFERENCED A SPECIFIC AMOUNT OF SQUARE FOOTAGE NECESSARY TO ACCESS THE ABILITY TO INCLUDE ANY KIND OF RETAIL RESTAURANT USE IN AN OFFICE DISTRICT. TURNS OUT THAT ONLY TWO PROPERTIES HAD THAT MUCH SQUARE FOOTAGE. SO IT SEEMED A LITTLE BIT LIKE WE WOULD BE GIVING SPECIAL PRIVILEGE TO ONE REPORT OWNER OR TWO PROPERTY OWNERS AS THE CASE WAS. SO WE WIDENED THE CONVERSATION TO GIVE EQUAL ACCESS AND OPPORTUNITY TO THIS KIND OF AMENITY TO ANY OFFICE, ANY OFFICE USE.
00:47:43.716: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
00:47:48.621: >> Councilmember Griswold: JUST A REAL BASIC QUESTION. I HAVE BEEN IN MANY OFFICE BUILDINGS AND FREQUENTLY THERE'S LIKE A LITTLE SNACK BAR OR A LITTLE RESTAURANT. SO WHAT EXACTLY IS THIS DOING BEYOND WHAT WE ALREADY HAVE?
00:48:04.537: >> SURE. THE ZONING ORDINANCE ALLOWS ACCESSORY USES AND THEY ARE OFTEN UNDEFINED WHICH IS VERY COMMON BUT THEY ARE -- THERE'S A PHRASE, BUT INCIDENTAL USES THAT ARE NORMAL AND CUSTOMARY ARE PERMITTED AND CAFETERIAS IN OFFICE DISTRICTS ARE ALREADY ALLOWED. THIS IS A NORMAL AND CUSTOMARY THING. THE INTENTION IS THAT IT'S A CAFETERIA SETTING ASIDE HOW THE FOOD IS PAD FOR BUT THE CAFETERIA FOR THOSE EMPLOYEES OF THE BUILDING THAT'S A NORMAL AND CUSTOMARY USE. THIS IS TO ALLOW ANY RESTAURANT LIKE A CHAIN RESTAURANT. I E EXPLAINED IT TO MY KIDS. THIS IS ALLOWING LIKE OLIVE GARDEN TO OPERATE, WATER TO OPERATE IN THE BUILDING. -- WHETHER TO OPERATE UNTIL BIDDING. OWN THE LARGEST PA PARCELS CAN SUPPORT. THAT IT'S UNLIKELY OTHER OFFICES WOULD BE ABLE TO SUPPORT MORE LIKE WHAT CITY HALL HAS, THE SMALL CAFE, BUT IT WOULD NOT BE INTENDED SOLELY FOR THE OCCUPANTS OF THE BUILDING THEMSELVES, BUT IT MIGHT BE OPEN -- IT WOULD BE OPEN TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC. IT MIGHT BE OPEN LONGER HOURS OR WEEKENDS. BUT IT WOULD BE A RESTAURANT IN THAT OFFICE DISTRICT.
00:49:24.684: >> Councilmember Griswold: AND I BELIEVE 777 HAD SUCH A -- 777 BUILDING HAD SUCH A RESTAURANT WHEN IT WAS FIRST OPENED. SO MAYBE IT WAS JUST NOT IN COMPLIANCE AT THAT TIME?
00:49:41.134: >> IT COULD HAVE BEEN. I'M PERSONALLY NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE RESTAURANT.
00:49:45.304: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I GUESS THAT'S WHY I'M CONFUSED WHAT THIS OR ORDINANCE IS GOINGO DO WITH REGARD TO WHAT IS ALRALREADYEXISTS.
00:49:56.816: >> YEAH.
00:49:57.083: >> Councilmember Griswold:  IS THERE A SUSTAINABILITY? IS IT THAT PEOPLE WILL NOT DRIVE AT LUNCHTIME BECAUSE THEY CAN EAT IN TH THEIR BUILDING.
00:50:09.328: >> THIS IS GIVING FOLKS AN OPPORTUNITY TO GRAB A BITE TO EAT, WHETHER IT'S AFTER HOURS. SO MAKING THE CLOSER CONNECTION BETWEEN WHERE YOU LIVE, WORK AND PLAY.
00:50:21.707: >> Councilmember Griswold: OH, OKAY. GREAT. THANKS.
00:50:25.878: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
00:50:28.047: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU. THIS IS THE FIRST READING. SO WE'LL HAVE ANOTHER CHANCE TO TALK ABOUT THIS. I GUESS I JUST WANT TO MAKE SOME COMMENTS ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE MIXED USE GENERALLY. I THINK WE SEE THAT THE OFFICE HAS ALL OF THESE OTHER PERMITTED USES. AND WHEN WE LOOK AT THE NEEDS IN OUR CITY, ONE OF THE NEEDS THAT WE SEEM TO HAVE IN OUR CITY IS HOUSING AND, YOU KNOW, THAT'S A PERMITTED USE IN OFFICE IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN. AND SO OFFICE WOULD ALLOW HOUSING USES; IS THAT CORRECT? YEAH? SO I JUST WONDER HOW IT CAME TO US THAT WE'RE HEADED FOR A RESTAURANT. YOU KNOW, THERE'S NO LACK OF RESTAURANTS HERE IN THE CITY. AND WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT CHANGING AROUND OFFICE TO PERMIT MORE HOUSING OR PERHAPS MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE CITY OR MORE HOUSING IN THE TRANSIT AREAS AND SO ON. BECAUSE I KNOW A LOT OF THESE OFFICES FROM LOOKING AT THE MAP. A LOT OF THESE OFFICE DISTRICTS ACT AS A BUFFER BETWEEN THE NEIGHBORHOODS AND THE COMMERCIAL DISTRICTS. IT WOULD SEEM NATURAL TO LET THE NEIGHBORHOOD CREEP ONE WAY AND MAYBE NOT THE COMMERCIAL DISTRICT TO CREEP THE OTHER WAY. I JUST WANTED TO EXPRESS THOSE SORT OF CONCERNS. WE HAD SOME CONVERSATIONS WITH SOME NEIGHBORS THIS WEEKEND ABOUT THESE TYPES OF THINGS AND, YOU KNOW, MY INITIAL CONCERN WITH THIS WAS THE ORIGINATION OF IT, BECAUSE AS COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN POINTED OUT, THE FIRST SQUARE FOOTAGE SETUP OF IT REALLY DID KIND OF FAVOR THE PETITIONER. IT LOOKED LIKE THEY WERE WANTING TO -- FRANKLY WANTING TO DO THIS SO THAT THEY COULD HEAD SOMETHING DOWN THE PIPELINE AND THEY NEEDED THE ORDINANCE TO CHANGE TO ALLOW THAT. AND, YOU KNOW, WE DON'T NECESSARILY WANT -- I MEAN, THE CORPORATIONS ARE PEOPLE TOO, I KNOW. BUT IS IT NECESSARILY THE RIGHT THING THAT WE HAVE A LARGE LAND-HOLDING CORPORATION COMING IN HERE AND WRITING SUGGESTS TO CHANGE OUR ZONING CODE THAT MAY BENEFIT THEM MATERIALLY? AND THAT'S WHAT WE HAD IN THIS CASE. SO I'M GLAD TO SEE THAT IT WAS MODIFIED BY THE PLANNING COMMISSION. AND, YOU KNOW, I'M NOT SURE HOW NECESSARY IT IS OR HOW I FEEL ABOUT IT AND I'M ACTUALLY NOT SURE THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT CHANGES TO OUR ZONING CODE ON THE LITERAL DOOR STEP OF REDOING OUR MASTER PLAN AN LAND USE PLANNING. HE WANTED TO SHARE THOSE CONCERNS WITH MANY I COLLEAGUES AND THE PUBLIC GENERALLY. YOU KNOW, WE HAD -- IS IT ANY -- IS ANY -- I WILL ASK COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN THIS. ANY ZONING CHANGE THAT MIGHT BE WANTED BY A -- THROUGH THIS PETITION PROCESS THAT COULD BE ANYTHING TO OUR PLANNING AND ZONING, THAT'S CORRECT?
00:53:05.671: >> Councilmember Ackerman: IT'S A BETTER QUESTION FOR STAFF, BUT I WOULD IMAGINE SO.
00:53:09.742: >> Councilmember Hayner: YEAH. SO WE RECENTLY -- IT BUBBLED UP WE WOULD TAKE A FRESH LOOK AT OUR SIGN ORDINANCE HERE IN TOWN. WAS THAT FROM PETITION ALSO?
00:53:20.686: >> NO. NO. I CAN CITE THE SECTION OF CODE BUT THERE ARE THREE WAYS TO INITIATE A CHAPTER AMENDMENT. CITY COUNCIL CAN INITIATE IT. IT CAN BE INITIATED BY STAFF OR PETITION. SOMEONE COMING IN. THE STAFF WORKS WITH THE PLANNING COMMISSION TO SET WHAT ORDINANCE AMENDMENTS WE SHOULD BE REVIEWING OR TAKING ON. COUNCIL HAS THEIR METHOD OF MAKING ASSIGNMENTS AND THEN WHEN A PETITION SENDS US AN APPLICATION. WE DO ALLOW THAT STUDENT. EVERYONE IS ENTITLED TO THEIR DAY IN COURT BUT THE PLANNING COMMISSION AND SPECIFICALLY THE ORDINANCE REVISIONS, THEY ARE THE VETTING BODY, SAYING THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN TAKE ON IMMEDIATELY. OR THIS IS SOMETHING THAT CAN BE DEFERRED. THE SIGN ORDINANCE AMENDMENT WAS INITIATED BY BOTH COUNCIL AND PLANNING COMMISSION.
00:54:15.641: >> Councilmember Hayner:  OH, OKAY. I WONDER WHAT THE REASON FOR THAT WAS. I HAVE MY SUSPICIONS.
00:54:21.080: >> THE SIGN ORDINANCE IS SOLELY OUT OF DATE.
00:54:24.450: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I KNOW THAT IT IS.
00:54:25.518: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  WE ARE JUST GOING TO GET OUT OF COMPLIANCE WITH STATE LAW VERY SOON AND IT MAKES US LIBEL TO THE FIRST AMENDMENT LAWSUIT.
00:54:32.525: >> AND ONE OF THE CHARGES OF ORDINANCE COMMITTEE IS TO CONSTANTLY LOOK AT THE CODE AND SEE WHAT NEEDS UPDATED.
00:54:38.898: >> Councilmember Hayner: OKAY. THANK YOU.
00:54:43.402: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
00:54:44.370: >> Councilmember Grand: I WANT TO THANK STAFF FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. I WILL FIND THIS TO BE A REAL POSITIVE TO PUSH MORE MIXED USE IN ANY SORT OF DISTRICT. I THINK WE LOOK AT THE LOCATION OF WHERE THIS REQUEST WAS INITIALLY COMING FROM. THIS IS POSSIBLY HOPEFULLY WHERE WE ARE GOING TO HAVE OUR FIRST REAL PUSH FOR TRANSIENT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT IN THE CITY AND I WOULD LOOK AT THIS AS A LOGICAL STEP TO BRING IN SOME MORE MIXED USE IN THE OFFICE BUILDINGS WHERE WE WILL HOPEFULLY SEE MORE HOUSING AS WELL. I ALSO THINK IT'S JUST RESPONSIVE TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING IN THOSE OFFICE BUILDINGS THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO DRIVE TO GET SOMETHING TO EAT AND THEY MAY NOT ALWAYS HAVE TIME TO BRING FOOD IN TO EAT. SO IT MAKES SENSE THAT THERE MIGHT BE A RESTAURANT OR TWO IN THEIR OFFICE BUILDING. SO I LOOK AT THIS AS A REAL LOGICAL STEP IN THAT INTEGRATION TOWARDS MORE OF THESE NEIGHBORHOOD DISTRICTS THAT WE ARE HOPING FOR WHERE WE SEE A LOT OF MIXED USE AND ACCESS TO TRANSIT.
00:55:45.264: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED?
00:55:49.702: >> Councilmember Hayner: OPPOSED.
00:55:51.937: >> Mayor Taylor: I'M SORRY. IT IS APPROVED WITH 11 COUNCILMEMBERS PRESENT, 10 VOTING IN THE AFFIRMATIVE. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER VOTING IN OPPOSITION. C-2, AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND SECTION 5.17.4 OF CHAPTER 55 UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE OF TITLE V OF THE CODE OF THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR MIXED USE ZONING DISTRICT DIMENSIONS. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN AND SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM. DISCUSSION OF C-2? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. DC-1R SOLUTION FOR COMMUNITY EVENTS FUND DISPERSEMENTS FROM THE FISCAL YEAR 2020 BUDGET. MOVED BY GRAND AND SECONDED BY -- COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
00:56:41.353: >> Councilmember Grand: I WOULD LIKE TO THANK SARAH HIGGINS WHO IS BEHIND THIS PROCESS THAT ALLOWS SO MANY OF OUR COMMUNITY GROUPS MAKE THEIR EVENTS MORE AFFORDABLE TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR MANY OF US IN THE CITY. AS OUR EXPENSES HAVE BEEN INCREASING THAT WE NEED TO CHARGE SOME OF THESE GROUPS TO ENSURE THAT THESE EVENTS ARE SECURE, IT'S -- YOU KNOW, IT REALLY IS HELPING THAT WE CAN OFFSET SOME OF THE COSTS FOR GROUPS SO THAT THEY CAN PROVIDE THESE EVENTS AND SARAH SIGNIHIGGINSHELPS US THROUGH PRS WITH -- SHE'S METICULOUS AND DOES AN OUTSTANDING JOB REACHING OUT TO ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE PARTICIPATED BEFORE, TO REMIND THEM, AND SHE DOES AN EXCELLENT JOB ANSWERING QUESTIONS AND REALLY HAS CREATED A PROCESS WHERE WE HAVE DATA FOR YEARS AND YEARS TO LOOK BACK HISTORICALLY AND, YOU KNOW, JUST MAKES IT, I THINK, A VERY CLEAN, SIMPLE SYSTEM FOR FOLKS IN THE COMMUNITIES TO ACCESS THE RESOURCES. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER FOR PARTICIPATING IN THE PROCESS WITH ME.
00:57:48.921: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
00:57:49.822: >> Councilmember Bannister:  I WANT TO THANK COUNCILMEMBER GRAND AND SARAH HIGGINS FOR WORKING ON THE COMMUNITY EVENTS FUND. AND JUST FOR PEOPLE -- RESIDENTS OUT THERE WHO MIGHT BE INTERESTED, IF YOU GO TO THE A2GOV.ORG WEBSITE, AND PUT IN COMMUNITY EVENTS, YOU WILL GET THE APPLICATION FOR -- TO APPLY TO BE REIMBURSED FOR YOUR EXPENSES THAT THE CITY MIGHT BE CHARGING YOU FOR YOUR EVENT, FOR BARRICADES, AND ANN ARBOR POLICE DEPARTMENT AND PUBLIC SERVICES COSTS. IT'S ABOUT $59,000 THIS YEAR -- NOT ABOUT. IT IS JUST SHORT OF $59,000 THIS YEAR. AND THAT IS REIMBURSED TO DIFFERENT EVENTS LIKE SUMMER FESTIVAL AND ART FAIR AND ANN ARBOR JAY SEECEES AND A WHOLE LT OF THEM. IF YOU ARE RUNNING A COMMUNITY EVENT, YOU COULD GO TO COMMUNITY EVENTS ON THE WEBSITE. AND THE DEADLINE WILL BE NEXT JUNE OF 2020 IT'S JULY JULY 1st THROUGH JUNE 30th. I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE AN ADVERTISEMENT SO IF MORE COMMUNITY EVENTS WOULD LIKE TO APPLY TO HAVE THEIR FEES FOR BARRICADES AND SUCH WAIVED THAT IS THE PROCESS.
00:59:16.108: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
00:59:16.975: >> Councilmember Hayner:  IS THIS A WAIVING OF FEES OR IS THIS A CHARGING THE PEOPLE TO PAY US BACK FOR THE PLACING THE BARRICADES AND THEN WE USE THIS FUND TO REIMBURSE THEM FOR THAT CHARGE? DOES ANYBODY WANT TO -- I JUST -- YOU KNOW, I THINK I SHARED WITH SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES AND MR. LAZARUS AND SO ON THAT THERE'S CONCERNS BY SOME OF THESE FOLKS THAT THE FEE THAT WE PUT THE BARRICADES DOWN IS ONEROUS FOR THEM, ESPECIALLY FOR THE SMALL EVENTS AND I KNOW THAT WE ARE OFFSETTING THAT THIS THIS WAY BUT I'M SKEPTICAL ABOUT THESE BOOKKEEPING SHUFFLINGS GOING ON. I WOULD LIKE TO BE WAIVING FEES FOR, SAY, THE ANN ARBOR HOUSING COMMISSION WHEN THEY HAVE $500,000 IN PLAN REVIEW SERVICES IN ONE OF THEIR PROJECTS THAT'S COMING BACK TO THE CITY. AND IT'S SORT OF LIKE -- SO THERE'S THESE SORT OF ODD LOOPS OF CITY MONEY GOING AROUND AND I -- THAT'S WHERE IT I MONEY DISAPPEARS. IT GET MSS IN THIS LITTLE LOOP. I WAS WONDERING IF THAT'S HOW THAT'S WORKING OR STRAIGHT UP WAIVING FEES OR COULD SOMEONE ANSWER THAT FOR ME?
01:00:31.350: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. LAZARUS.
01:00:31.984: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I KNOW IT'S A BUDGET ITEM.
01:00:34.520: >> City Admin. Lazarus: IT'S NOT A WAIVER OF FEES. IT'S MORE OF A GRANT.
01:00:38.857: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM AND THEN GRANT.
01:00:40.759: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES, I WOULD JUST ADD THAT, SO THIS IS -- WITH WE APPROVE THE BUDGET, WE APPROVE ALSO THIS FUND. AND THE -- AS COUNCILMEMBER MANNISTER KNOWS, -- COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTERS KNOWS, FOR THE SUMMER FESTIVAL, IN THEIR CASE, IT'S $28,000, ART FAIR $11,000. THE JAYCEES $8,000, AND ALL OF THE OTHERS, IT'S ABOUT $1,000 OR LESS. AND I KNOW -- I WAS ON THE ART FAIR BOARD FOR A LOT OF YEARS. OKAY, THEY ARE ONE OF THE LARGEST RECIPIENTS. THAT DOESN'T BEGIN TO COVER WHAT THEY PAY FOR, FOR ALL THE BARRICADES, AND -- YEAH. IT'S NOT A WAIVER FEES AS THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR SAID AND IT'S REALLY A GRANT TO COVER PART OF THEIR EVENT EXPENSES. BUT, YEAH, WE HAVE A LOT OF EVENTS AND WE ARE ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE THIS TO THESE LARGE EVENTS, AND THE OTHERS, IT'S ON AVERAGE ABOUT $1,000 OR LESS. IF ANY WAIVERS, THEN, YOU KNOW, IT'S GOT -- THE FUNDs HAS GOT TO COME FROM SOMEWHERE AND, AGAIN, WE APPROVE THE BUDGET. WE APPROVE THIS FUND.
01:02:05.878: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
01:02:07.546: >> Councilmember Grand: NO NEED.
01:02:09.047: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
01:02:09.915: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES, THANK YOU. I ACTUALLY SPENT SOME TIME SPEAKING WITH FOLKS LIKE MR. TUCKER AND WE TALK ABOUT FAIR MOON AND THE ART FAIR PEOPLE. CAN WE TAKE A LOOK AT WHEN WE -- NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET. I KNOW WE HAVE A TWO-YEAR CYCLE AND EVERYTHING. THEY HAVE EXPRESSED GRAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE COSTS OF THE CITIES CHARGING THEM FOR SOME OF THESE SERVICES AND I THINK IT'S JUST SOMETHING JUST TO -- ON OUR RADAR WITH A NEW POLICE CHIEF HERE IN TOWN. WE MIGHT HAVE -- BRING SOME GREAT IDEAS FROM THE EAST COAST FOR US OR SOMETHING. JUST DIFFERENT WAYS OF DOING THINGS AND CHARGING PEOPLE FOR IT THAT WILL HELP TO FACILITATE THIS KIND OF, YOU KNOW, ACTIVITY THAT MAKES ANN ARBOR WHAT IT IS. SO I JUST WANTED TO THROW THAT OUT THERE.
01:02:53.225: >> City Admin. Lazarus: IF I COULD ADD. IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S NECESSARILY UNDER THE RADAR. POLICE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN WORKING, I GIVE TARGET BILL CLOCK A LOT OF CREDIT FOR PUTTING BARRICADES IN AND BEING MORE FLEXIBILITY WITH THE TYPES OF BARRICADES THAT WE'RE REQUIRING, PARTICULARRING FOR SMALLER EVENTS. D.D.A. HAS HAD A BIG PART IN THIS AS WELL. IN THE 2018 BUDGET, COUNCIL SET ASIDE SOME FUNDS FOR US TO LOOK AT, BOTH TO LOOK AT THE KINDS OF SECURITY REQUIRING, AS WELL AS TO PROVIDE SOME SUPPORT. I THINK THERE'S BEEN SOME BENEFICIAL OUTCOMES FROM THAT AND I WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO GIVE AN UPDATE TO COUNCIL OF WHERE WE ARE.
01:03:38.537: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
01:03:39.705: >> Councilmember Bannister: AND I MIGHT SUGGEST THAT FOR EVENTS THAT WOULD LIKE TO HAVE ONE OF THESE GRANTS, DON'T WAIT UNTIL JUNE TO PUT IN YOUR APPLICATION. IF YOU PUT IT IN SOONER RATHER THAN LATER, THEN MAYBE WE CAN CONSIDER IT DURING THE BUDGET PROCESS AND IF WE NEED TO CONSIDER ALLOCATING MORE THAN $59,000 TO THIS, WE COULD DO IT IN THE MONTHS LEADING UP TO THE BUDGET VOTE IN MAY.
01:04:08.266: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:04:09.167: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES, THANK YOU. IT'S BEEN MY EXPERIENCE THAT STAFF HAS BEEN DOING THEIR BEST AT MINIMIZING COSTS AND I KNOW THAT THE WATER HILL MUSIC FESTIVAL, MR. NEWEL HAD ASKED FOR STREET CLOSURE PERMIT LATE, AND WHEN I WENT AND SAW HIM THAT DAY, HE WAS REALLY GRATEFUL FOR THE CITY AND THE EFFORTS THAT THEY TOOK TO MINIMIZE THE COSTS TO BARRICADE SPRING STREET
01:09:36.927: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  I WILL LEAVE IT THERE. I THINK WE MAKE TOO MUCH OF A STATEMENT BY REMOVING IT AND I THINK WE SHOULD KEEP IT IN BECAUSE IT IS THE TRUTH.
01:09:46.037: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
01:09:47.505: >> Councilmember Grand: I WASN'T AWARE THAT COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER IS AN EXPERT IN ELECTION LAW AND IS GOING TO BE TELLING STAFF HOW WE SHOULD BE COMPLYING WITH FOIA. TWO,  IT IS COMPLETELY INSULTING TO OUR STAFF WHO IS IN FULL COMPLIANCE WITH FOIA. IF WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHO ARE NOT IN FULL COMPLIANCE WITH FOIA, IT'S SOMEBODY OF OUR COUNCILMEMBERS, INCLUDING COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER WHO HAS NOT COMPLIED WITH THE FOIA REQUEST, AND IS REPRESENTED BY AN ATTORNEY SO SHE'S NOT COMPLY WITH THAT FOIA REQUEST. TO SAY THAT THE IT I IS NOT IN -- THAT THE CITY IS NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH FOIA, IT'S INSULTING TO TO OUR STAFF AND THIS BODY AND I TAKE IT AS A PERSONAL INSULT TO SAY THAT WHEN YOU YOURSELF CANNOT COMPLY WITH THAT FOIA REQUEST. IT'S JUST RIDICULOUS TO ME. I WILL SPEAK TO REST OF THIS LATER AND WHY THIS IS PROBLEMATIC.
01:10:51.269: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD ON THE AMENDMENT.
01:10:53.138: >> Councilmember Griswold: THANK YOU. RATHER THAN MAKING CRITICAL REMARKS, I WANT TO -- [ OFF MICROPHONE COMMENTS ] WHEN WE ARE NOT ACTING IN A PROFESSIONAL MANNER. HOWEVER, I THINK THAT THAT FIRST STATEMENT IS SIMPLY UNRELATED TO THE RESOLVE CLAUSE. SO I DON'T HAVE A STRONG OPINION EITHER WAY.
01:11:16.394: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
01:11:17.429: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. SINCE YOU ARE NOW AT THE TABLE, YOU ARE ALSO NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE FOIA REQUEST THAT WAS MADE MONTHS AGO BY A MEMBER OF OUR COMMUNITY. AND I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S UNPROFESSIONAL FOR ME TO CALL YOU OUT ABOUT IT. I THINK IT'S UNPROFESSIONAL TO NOT COMPLY WITH THE FOIA AMENDMENT.
01:11:43.121: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION FOR THE AMENDMENT. I WILL VOTE AGAINST THE AMENDMENT. I BELIEVE THAT CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE AND THE CITY STAFF ARE IN FULL COMPLIANCE WITH THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT, THE COMPLIANCE WITH THE -- WITH THE FOIA, WITH THE OPEN MEETINGS ACT, WITH VOLUNTARILY TRANSPARENCY. THESE ARE THINGS WE DO ABSOLUTELY EVERY DAY. THESE ARE THINGS WE DO BECAUSE THEY ARE IMPORTANT TO HELP EDUCATE THE PUBLIC ABOUT THE WORK THAT WE DO ON THEIR BEHALF. TO ALLOW THEM TO HELP US DO IT, TO HELP GUIDE US IN ITS DOING AND WHEN FOLKS IN THE PUBLIC DISAGREE WITH IT, TO CHANGE IT. THIS IS -- HAD IS AT ITS CORE THE -- YOU KNOW, IN PART THE REASONS FOR THE CHARGE AND WE TAKE THAT VERY SERIOUSLY. I THINK IT IS -- WELL, I THINK THAT THE SUGGESTION THAT WE ARE ACTING AS AN ORGANIZATION OTHERWISE IS IMPROPER AND INACCURATE. COUNCILMEMBER EATON AND THEN RAMLAWI.
01:12:50.021: >> Councilmember Eaton: I WANT TO POINT OUT THE CONTRADICTORY STATEMENT THAT COUNCILMEMBER GRAND MADE. SHE SAID THAT THE CITY IS IN FULL COMPLIANCE WITH FOIA AND THEN SHE TURNED TO HER TWO COLLEAGUES AND SAID THAT THEY ARE NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH FOIA. THEY ARE REPRESENTATIVES OF CITY. IF YOU ARE ACCUSING THEM OF NOT COMPLYING WITH FOIA, THEN YOU ARE AGREEING THAT THIS STATEMENT ISN'T COMPLETELY TRUE. THIS STATEMENT SAYS THE CITY IS IN FULL COMPLIANCE WITH FOIA. AND SO RATHER THAN DEBATE WHO IS IN COMPLIANCE OR WHO IS RIGHT ABOUT FOIA, I THINK THAT SIMPLY STRIKING THIS LANGUAGE BECAUSE IT'S NOT NECESSARY FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE RESOLUTION IS THE BEST OUTCOME. I HOPE YOU WILL RESPOND.
01:13:38.336: >> Councilmember Grand: I WOULD LIKE TO RESPOND TO THAT.
01:13:42.273: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI AND THEN GRAND AND ACKERMAN.
01:13:46.044: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: JUST FOR CLARIFICATION, THIS IS ON THE AMENDMENT. THE AMENDMENT STILL. ON THE AMENDMENT, I WOULD JUST -- I WAS WONDERING IF WE CAN HAVE MR. POSTEMA ANSWER THIS QUESTION FOR US, IF IT'S PERMISSIBLE AT THIS POINT, IF IT'S NOT, I UNDERSTAND. BUT I -- I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHETHER THAT WHEREAS [ APPLAUSE ] IS ONE THAT STANDS THE TEST OF COMPLIANCE.
01:14:26.918: >> City Atty. Postema: WELL, WHEN THE CITY -- THE CITY HAS AN EXTENSIVE POLICY AND PROCESS FOR COMPLYING WITH FOIA AND IN THAT SENSE, THE CITY OVERALL IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH FOIA. HOWEVER, THERE'S SOME ASPECTS OF FOIA THAT REQUIRE THE CITY TO HAVE COUNCILMEMBERS TURN OVER CERTAIN EMAILS AND THERE HAS BEEN AT LEAST ONE RESPONSE FROM THE CITY THAT HAS INDICATED THAT THE RESPONSE WAS NOT COMPLETE BECAUSE CERTAIN DOCUMENTS HAD NOT BEEN RECEIVED. SO IN THAT SENSE, WE ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH FOIA IN PROVIDING THE RESPONSE, AND WE HAVE DONE THAT. HOWEVER, THE LETTER DID INDICATE THAT PERHAPS NOT ALL THE DOCUMENTS HAD BEEN TURNED OVER AND FOR WHAT REASON.
01:15:16.067: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  SO THAT THE WORD "OPERATES." WOULD QUALIFY UNDER WHAT WE JUST WERE TOLD? WE OPERATE IN COMPLIANCE.
01:15:34.419: >> City Atty. Postema: THE OVERALL OPERATION OF THE FOIA SYSTEM UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION ULTIMATELY OF THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR IS DONE WITHIN IN COMPLIANCE OF THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT. HOWEVER, I HAVE GIVEN YOU AN EXAMPLE OF IN DOING SO THAT THERE WAS INCOMPLETE PROVISION OF DOCUMENTS.
01:16:02.880: >> Mayor Taylor: I'VE GOT COUNCILMEMBER GRAND, ACKERMAN, HAYNER.
01:16:10.021: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. I JUST WOULD LIKE TO RESPOND TO COUNCILMEMBER EATON'S COMMENTS AS I BELIEVE WAS JUST BACKED UP BY OUR CITY ATTORNEY THAT WHILE THE CITY IS AND DOES OPERATE IN FULL COMPLIANCE, PERHAPS WHAT I'M POINTING OUT IS THAT THE CURRENT -- THE TWO MEMBERS OF THE CITY COUNCIL ARE NOT COMPLYING WITH A FOIA REQUEST. THAT DOES NOT SPEAK TO THE CITY'S ABILITY TO OPERATE. I THINK IT SPEAKS DIRECTLY TO THE ACTION OF THOSE TWO COUNCILMEMBERS.
01:16:41.219: >> Mayor Taylor: I KIND OF GOT LOST. I THINK I HAVE ACKERMAN, HAYNER, GRISWOLD.
01:16:45.323: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  SO RIGHT NOW, THE SENTENCE READS WHEREAS THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR OPERATES IN FULL COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE MICHIGAN FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT FOIA. IF WE'RE FOLLOWING COUNCILMEMBER EATON'S LOGIC THAT WE ARE NOT IN COMPLIANCE BECAUSE TWO COUNCILMEMBERS WON'T RELEASE DOCUMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN REQUESTED BY THE PUBLIC, THEN THE MOST ACCURATE SENTENCE WOULD BE -- AND THIS WOULD BE THE APPROPRIATE AMENDMENT, THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR DOES NOT OPERATE IN FULL COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF INITIAL INITIAL FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT BECAUSE TWO ACTORS WILL NOT RELEASE DOCUMENTS. THAT WOULD BE THE MOST HONEST, IF WE ARE FOLLOWING THAT LOGIC.
01:17:22.627: >> Councilmember Eaton: THAT'S NOT WHAT I SAID.
01:17:26.664: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
01:17:27.799: >> Councilmember Hayner:  AND THAT'S NOT WHAT MR. POSTEMA SAID. MR. POSTEMA SAID THAT THE CITY OPERATES IN FULL COMPLIANCE, DESPITE THESE DIFFICULTIES BEHIND THE SCENES. WE ARE KEEPING WITH THE DEADLINES OF RESPONSE TO THE REQUESTERS. IF THERE'S SOME KIND OF LEGAL ACTION AROUND IT -- BEHIND THE SCENES HERE GOING ON, IT DOESN'T MEAN WE ARE NOT IN COMPLIANCE. IT MEANS THAT THAT COMPLIANCE IS HELD IN ABEYANCE UNTIL IT'S RESOLVED IN THE COURTS IS MY UNDERSTANDING, AND SO I FIND THIS -- DESPITE WHATEVER IS GOING ON HERE WITH FOIA, AND SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES, I FIND THIS TO BE AN ACCURATE STATEMENT AND I WOULD SUGGEST THAT IT'S THE TYPE OF STATEMENT WE WOULD LIKE TO LEAD UP ANY TYPE OF CONVERSATION ABOUT FOIA, BECAUSE I -- I BELIEVE THAT WE DO OUR BEST AND OUR STAFF DOES THEIR BEST AND I KNOW WE HAVE EXCELLENT CLERKS AND SO ON AND I -- I CAN'T SUPPORT TAKING IT OUT AND I DON'T KNOW WHY WE WOULD EVEN CONSIDER DOING IT.
01:18:30.895: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
01:18:32.129: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I HAVE NOT BEEN INFORMED OF BEING IN VIOLATION OF FOIA, NOR IN HAVING ANY DOCUMENTS THAT ARE MISSING. I EITHER DO MY BUSINESS ON MY A2GOV ACCOUNT OR WHEN I DO USE MY OTHER LAPTOP WITH MY GMAIL ACCOUNT, AND I DO GET SOME EMAILS THAT WAY, I SIMPLY COPY MY GOVERNMENT ACCOUNT. AND SO THOSE FILES ARE ALL ON THE CITY'S SERVER. SO IF THERE'S SOMETHING THAT'S MISSING, I HAVEN'T BEEN INFORMED OF IT HOWEVER, I HAVE ASKED FOR LEGAL CLARIFICATION IN A FEW INSTANCES BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT I HAVEN'T TURNED ANYTHING OVER. I'M SOMEWHAT MYSTIFIED BY THE CONVERSATION.
01:19:23.814: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ON THE AMENDMENT? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE. STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER LUMM. THE AMENDMENT TO STRIKE THE WHEREAS CLAUSE.
01:19:38.529: >> Councilmember Lumm: NO.
01:19:39.130: >> Councilmember Grand: NO.
01:19:39.730: >> Councilmember Ackerman: NO.
01:19:42.600: >> Councilmember Eaton: YES.
01:19:43.200: >> Mayor Taylor: NO.
01:19:44.268: >> Councilmember Nelson:  NO.
01:19:45.836: >> Councilmember Smith: NO.
01:19:46.437: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  NO.
01:19:47.038: >> Councilmember Hayner:  NO.
01:19:48.205: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES.
01:19:50.207: >> Councilmember Griswold: NO.
01:19:51.108: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION FAILS.
01:19:52.677: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN MOTION. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:19:55.179: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, MAYOR TAYLOR. WELL, I'M PROBABLY GOING TO SPEAK ON THIS TWICE. SO I WILL KEEP THIS RATHER BRIEF THE FIRST TIME. THIS MOTION, I'M GLAD IT COMES UP. I'M NOT SURE IF I SUPPORT IT THE WAY IT IS CURRENTLY, BUT I DEFINITELY NEED A BETTER UNDERSTANDING. I THINK THE ISSUE CURRENTLY THAT WE ARE HAVING IN THE COMMUNITY AND ON COUNCIL IS JUST A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IS PUBLIC DOCUMENT AND WHAT THE PUBLIC HAS ACCESS TO AND SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO. AND WHAT IS NECESSARY WITH THE FOIA REQUEST, AND WHERE THAT LINE IS DRAWN. AND IT JUST SEEMS TO BE THERE'S PUBLIC INFORMATION THAT SHOULD BE OUT THERE, THAT'S NOT THAT REPUTABLE MEDIA OUTLETS AND THAT'S THE OTHER THING, WHAT IS REPUTABLE MEDIA OUTLET AND WHO MAKES THAT DECISION? TO RELEASE PUBLIC DOCUMENTS THAT SHOULD BE OUT THERE FOR THE PUBLIC SAFETY AND WELFARE AND BETTERMENT. SO THAT WOULD REDUCE THE NEED FOR FOIA. THAT WOULD INCREASE THE TRANSPARENCY. THAT CALLS FOR TRANSPARENCY. SO I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS RESOLUTION IN THAT SPIRIT. AND THEN FURTHERMORE THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY WITH CONSTITUENTS WHO EMAIL THEIR ELECTED OFFICIALS AND I UNDERSTAND IT -- ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING GOES WHEN IT COMES TO FOIA. THAT'S WHAT HAS BEEN TOLD AND PRACTICED BY MYSELF AT LEAST WHERE YOU SEND SOMETHING TO ME, IT'S AS GOOD AS BEING IN THE PAPER. BUT I BELIEVE THERE SHOULD BE A LITTLE BIT MORE PRIVACY, I GUESS, BUT I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN VIA EMAIL OR ANYTHING ELECTRONIC. NOT THAT WE WANT TO BE OPERATING IN SECRECY, BUT PEOPLE DO APPRECIATE THEIR PRIVACY. AND SOME OF THESE FOIA REQUESTS, WHEN THEY ARE BEING RELEASED HAVE NOT REDACTED EMAILS OF OTHER RECIPIENTS AND PEOPLE THEN HAVE THEIR EMAIL ADDRESS RELEASED AMONGST SOME OTHER INFORMATION. THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY THOUGHT WOULD HAPPEN, SOMEBODY WHO IS NOT PRIVY TO ANY OF THE PARTIES THAT ARE INTERESTED IN THE FOIA. SO THAT'S MY TIME. [ LAUGHTER ]
01:22:37.641: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
01:22:38.542: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION. I THINK GENERALLY, I'M OKAY WITH THIS. I WILL VOTE FOR IT, SIMPLY BECAUSE IT'S A REQUEST TO BRING BACK, YOU KNOW, A FORMAL REVIEW ON THE PART OF THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR AND THE CITY ATTORNEY, WHO I THINK HAVE THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE PUBLIC AND COUNCIL IN MIND, AND, YOU KNOW, I HAVE A COUPLE, YOU KNOW, GENERAL QUALMS. YOU KNOW, I FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE CAN CITY COUNCIL GETTING SPECIAL TREATMENT, RIGHT, IF THE PUBLIC IS GOING TO BE CHARGED FOR SOMETHING, I THINK IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE THAT WE ARE AS WELL. I MEAN, I WAS SO EXCITED TO VOTE ABSENTEE FOR NO REASON FOR THE FIRST TIME. I SHOWED UP HERE AT 4:40 ONLY TO FIND OUT THAT THE CLERK'S OFFICE STOPPED TAKING APPLICATIONS AT 4 P.M. YOU KNOW, LIKE, I DIDN'T ASK FOR SPECIAL TREATMENT AND I FEEL -- I WOULD FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE ASKING FOR SPECIAL TREATMENT TO HAVE FEES WAIVED HERE AS WELL, AS JUST A GENERAL PHILOSOPHY. AND ALSO JUST THE SUGGESTIVE NATURE OF DECIDING WHAT'S A REPUTABLE NEWS SOURCE, LIKE COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI SAID. I'M FINE VOTING THROUGH IT HERE. I'M CURIOUS TO HEAR WHAT THE FEEDBACK IS, BUT IN TERMS OF A FIRST STEP, I -- I'M HAPPY TO VOTE FOR THIS.
01:23:55.920: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. COUNCILMEMBER NELSON?
01:23:58.389: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I FORGET WHO IT WAS THAT I WAS TALKING TO, BUT SOMEONE SUGGESTED TO ME THAT IN TERMS OF A FOIA REQUEST THAT WAS SORT OF A SPECIAL GRANTING TO A COUNCILMEMBER, PERHAPS THAT MIGHT BE A SITUATION WHERE IT SHOULD BE INFORMATION THAT'S PUBLICLY AVAILABLE ON A CITY WEBSITE. SO IT -- IT WOULD FEEL LESS -- LIKE LESS OF A GIFT TO A COUNCILMEMBER. I KNOW THAT I HAVE HEARD COUNCILMEMBER EATON DESCRIBE A COUPLE OF SITUATIONS WHERE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HELPFUL AND LEGITIMATELY PART OF HIS CONSTITUENCY WORK TO TRY TO GET INFORMATION AND WHEN THAT'S CLASSIFIED AS A FOIA, I GUESS I CAN IMAGINE A SITUATION THAT I I HAVE NOT YET BEEN IN ONE, WHY I FOUND MYSELF NEEDING INFORMATION THAT I'M ASKED TO PAY FOR, TO DO MY JOB AS A COUNCIL PERSON. SO I -- LIKE COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN, I HAVE NO PROBLEM SUPPORTING THIS BUT I CERTAINLY LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FEEDBACK FROM STAFF ABOUT BEST PRACTICES AND OTHER PLACES AND JUST SORT OF IDEAS MOVING FORWARD. WE'RE JUST GOING TO BE COLLECTING IDEAS. SO THAT SEEMS LIKE A GOOD THING. THANKS.
01:25:01.085: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER AND THEN GRAND.
01:25:05.623: >> Councilmember Hayner: COUNCILMEMBER NELSON BEING I WILL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE. CARD, THE CARD GROUP, THE DIOXANE WATCHDOG GROUP WANTS THE CITY, THE DATA THAT GELMAN HAS BEEN GIVING THE CITY, AND OTHER DATA THAT'S BEEN COLLECTED OPEN THE WELL TESTING RESULTS FOR THE LAST SO MANY YEARS. SINCE 2006, AND THE 2006 CONSENT JUDGMENT SAID THAT THE CITY GETS A SET OF DATA AND THE GELMAN PROVIDES OTHER PARTIES WITH THAT DATA. AND DOING TREND ANALYSIS THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS OF THE EXISTING DATA WE HAVE BEEN GETTING FROM GELMAN AND SPLIT SAMPLING AND SO ON FROM D.E.Q., WE FOUND THAT THERE'S HUGE VARIATIONS IN THE DATA. THEY ARE TELLING ONE PARTY ONE THING AND ANOTHER PARTY ANOTHER THING. OR IT'S NOT PUT IN THE RIGHT TABLE, THE RIGHT FORMAT. AND SO WE'RE HAVING A VERY DIFFICULT TIME KNOWING WHERE THE PROBLEM LIES. AND SO I HAVE BEEN ASKED TO IDENTIFY WHAT THAT DATA WOULD BE CALLED IN THE FOIA REQUEST SO THAT CARD COULD GET THAT DATA, COMPARE IT TO THE GELMAN DATA AND PURELY VOLUNTARILY ALTRUISTIC BASIS AND FIND OUT IF WHAT THE POLLUTER IS TELLING US IS TRUTH. AND SO THERE'S AN EXAMPLE OF MAYBE, YOU KNOW, I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO PAY FOR THAT OUT OF MY OWN POCKET TO -- IF IT DOES TAKE STAFF TIME TO DIG THAT UP. I CAN'T IMAGINE THERE WOULD BE REDACTIONS INVOLVED IN THAT SITUATION. BUT THAT'S WHERE THE STAFF TIME GOES, RIGHT, IS  REVIEWING AND REDACTING, THAT'S WHY THE STAFF FEES COME UP. NOW, OF COURSE THIS IS ON BEHALF OF ANOTHER -- OF A THIRD PARTY, THIS, YOU KNOW, NONPROFIT GROUP. AND THE NONPROFIT GROUP COULD ASK ON THEM -- YOU KNOW, ON THEIR OWN AND SO WE DEFINITELY DON'T WANT TO GO DOWN THE SLOPE WHERE EVERY RESIDENT SAYS, HEY, PUT THIS FOIA REQUEST THROUGH FOR ME SO I DON'T HAVE TO PAY. I DON'T THINK ANYONE WOULD REALLY DO THAT HERE AT THE TABLE. IT COULD HAPPEN. SO CONSTITUENT SERVICES. SO I SHARED SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED AT THE TABLE ABOUT THAT, AND I'M HAPPY TO MOVE IT FORWARD FOR THAT FOR ONE EXAMPLE AND JUST TO GET? INFORMATION BACK AND SEE IF WE SHOULD BE MORE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE NEEDS OF THE PUBLIC AND PUBLIC ADVOCACY GROUPS AND SO ON.
01:27:26.463: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
01:27:27.698: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. FIRST I HAVE A QUESTION IF THAT'S OKAY WITH THIS BODY FOR COUNCILMEMBER EATON. CAN YOU GIVE ME  AN EXAMPLE OF' REPUTABLE MEDIA OUTLET.
01:27:51.822: >> Councilmember Eaton: THAT'S WHAT I'M ASKING STAFF FOR CLARIFICATION ON.
01:27:55.192: >> Councilmember Grand: OKAY. THIS TO ME, WHILE I'M OFTEN WANTING TO HEAR FROM STAFF AND GET THEIR FEEDBACK, WE HAVE PLENTY OF EXAMPLES WHERE WHEN THIS BODY HAS DETERMINED THAT IT'S IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST TO RELEASE INFORMATION, WE MADE THAT REQUEST AT THIS TABLE TO GET THAT INFORMATION WITHOUT COST OF FOIA. SO I THINK THAT'S A REASONABLE SAFEGUARD THAT ALREADY EXISTS WITHIN OUR RULES AND OUR PRACTICE. I DON'T -- I REALLY DON'T LIKE THE IDEA OF COUNCILMEMBERS HAVING FREE ACCESS TO FOIA OR EVEN A REDUCED COST TO FOY A. I THINK THAT OPENS UP A SLIPPERY SLOPE AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT I CALL IT. SLIPPERY SLOPE OF MISTRUST AMONGST MEMBERS OF THIS BODY TO BE FOIAING ONE ANOTHER'S EMAILS. WHY CAN'T YOU JUST REACH OUT TO ONE OF YOUR COLLEAGUES ON COUNCIL AND ASK THEM ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON. LIKE COUNCILMEMBER NELSON, WHEN I NEEDED INFORMATION TO SERVE CONSTITUENTS, I FIND THAT THE REQUEST FOR INFORMATION PROCESS THAT WAS ESTABLISHED BY MR. FOREIGNER HAS COME IN HAS BEEN PERFECTLY ADEQUATE IN GETTING THE INFORMATION THAT I NEEDED TO GET BACK TO MY CONSTITUENTS. THE STAFF HAS BEEN QUITE RESPONSIVE. WE HAVE A RECORD OF THESE RESPONSES. AISLE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT -- I'M CONCERNED ABOUT COUNCILMEMBERS HAVING ACCESS TO FOIA. I THINK IT'S PROBLEMATIC AND I THINK IT BREEDS MISTRUST AND I THINK IT OVERSTEPS WHAT OUR ROLE AND I SHARE COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN'S CONCERNS ABOUT COUNCILMEMBERS GETTING SPECIAL TREATMENT. I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD HAVE, YOU KNOW, ACCESS TO FOIA WHEN OTHER MEMBERS. I KNOW WE HAVE HEARD THAT CONCERN FROM PEOPLE SITTING IN THE AUDIENCE. SO -- AND I REALLY DO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT -- ABOUT EVEN TRYING TO DEFINE IN THIS RAPIDLY TRAINING MEDIA LANDSCAPE WHAT A REPUTABLE MEDIA OUTLET IS. I JUST FEAR THAT WE CAN HAVE SOME WHO HAVE CALLED THEMSELVES MEMBERS OF THE MEDIA, AND SO FAR THE CITY HAS SAID, NO YOU ARE NOT AND SOME OF THOSE MEMBERS OF THE MEDIA STILL HAVE SOME BACKPAY IN TERMS OF FOIA FEES. SO, YOU KNOW, I JUST -- I THINK THIS JUST OPENS THE DOOR FOR -- FOR THOSE WHO CALL THEMSELVES MEDIA TO HAVE ACCESS TO FOIA AND NOT TO MENTION THE AMOUNT OF STAFF TIME THAT THIS COULD POTENTIALLY JUST CAUSE A REAL DRAIN ON OUR STAFF RESOURCES THAT, TO ME, IS TOTALLY UNNECESSARY.
01:30:53.904: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
01:30:54.771: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANKS. I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS. AS COUNCILMEMBER EATON NOTED, WHEN HE INTRODUCED IT, THIS -- AND THIS IS THE ARE E SOLUTION INDICATES, OBVIOUSLY, IT DOESN'T CHANGE ANY POLICY OR PRACTICE, JUST DIRECTS THE ADMINISTRATOR TO REVIEW THE FEE STRUCTURE. AND I THINK THE RESOLUTION APPROPRIATELY RECOGNIZES THE NEED -- THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A BALANCE. WHILE WE DESIRE AS MUCH TRANSPARENCY AND PUBLIC DISCLOSURE AS POSSIBLE, WE ALSO NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT MEETING FOIA REQUESTS TAKES STAFF TIME AND AS A RESULT HAS A COST. AND THAT'S A REASONABLE EXPECTATION AND DETERRENT TO FRIVOLOUS AND EXTENSIVE REQUESTS THAT CAN ABUSE THE FOIA REQUESTS. THIS ALSO SUGGESTS THAT THE SCOPE IS -- IT'S A LIMITED SCOPE OF REVIEW. SO I'M FINE SUPPORTING THIS. I THINK IT'S A REASONABLE REQUEST AND I APPRECIATE COUNCILMEMBER EATON BRINGING THIS FORWARD.
01:32:12.849: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER EATON?
01:32:14.551: >> Councilmember Eaton: SO I WANT TO ILLUSTRATE BY WHAT MOTIVATED ME TO BRING THIS FORWARD. IN JANUARY OF 2018, I REQUESTED POLICE RECORDS FOR A PROBLEM HOUSE IN THE 4th WARD. JUST THE POLICE REPORTS FOR A TWO-YEAR PERIOD WHICH TURNED OUT TO BE 208 PAGES OF POLICE MATERIALS. AND I WAS INFORMED THAT I WOULD OWE OVER $100 UNDER OUR FOIA. THE INFORMATION I WAS REQUESTING WAS PARTICULAR TO MY RESPONSIBILITIES TRYING TO REPRESENT THAT NEIGHBORHOOD. I DID PAY THAT FEE. WE HAVE DIFFERENT COUNSEL AT THAT TIME. I ASKED THAT IT BE TAKEN UP BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE COMMITTEE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY DID WITH IT BACK THEN. MORE RECENTLY, I ASKED FOR INFORMATION ABOUT THE TRAIN STATION SPECIFICALLY A GRANT THAT WAS APPLIED FOR AND PUTTING THE TRAIN STATION ON FULLER ROAD AND THE GRANT APPLICATION WAS DENIED. I DIDN'T ASK FOR THAT INFORMATION FOR MYSELF BUT I DID, IN FACT, ASK FOR IT FOR RESIDENTS WHO ARE ACUTELY INTERESTED IN THE DEBATE OVER WHERE WE PLACED OUR TRAIN STATION. AND THAT REQUEST WAS NOT HANDLED AS A FOIA REQUEST. IT WAS JUST SIMPLY TURNED OVER TO ME AND I, OF COURSE, TURNED IT OVER TO THE INTERESTED PARTIES. AND SO THERE'S BOTH THIS IDEA THAT WE ARE CHARGED WITH MATERIALS THAT WE NEED TO PERFORM OUR DUTIES, BUT NOT EVERY REQUEST FOR INFORMATION THAT WE MAKE IS BEING HANDLED CONSISTENTLY. SOME OF THEM ARE TREATED AS A FOIA REQUEST. SOME OF THEM ARE NOT. SO I JUST WOULD LIKE TO SET A POLICY. BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT I SHOULD WRITE THIS POLICY. I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM STAFF AND HEAR WHAT THEY THINK WE SHOULD DO WITH REGARD TO THAT PUBLIC INTEREST EXCEPTION TO FEES IN THE ACT. SO THAT'S THE MOTIVATION FOR THIS PARTICULAR RESOLUTION. I THINK IT'S WORTH WHILE TO HEAR FROM OUR STAFF ON THIS MATTER. THANK YOU.
01:34:35.625: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
01:34:37.594: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  I REALLY APPRECIATE THE EXAMPLES BROUGHT FORWARD BY COUNCILMEMBER EATON AND COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER. I THINK THESE ARE EXACTLY THE TYPES OPPORTUNITY WHERE THIS COULD BE WIELDED FOR GOOD. I JUST -- I WANT TO TRUST YOU AND I'M GOING TO VOTE FOR THIS. IT DOES MAKE IT DIFFICULT AS A COLLEAGUE WHEN THE NEXT AGENDA ITEM IS AN INSTANCE OF EXACTLY TRYING TO WAIVE THESE FEES BUT SEEMS TO BE ENTIRELY POLITICALLY MOTIVATED AND I DON'T WANT TO PUT THAT ASPERSION ON YOU, RIGHT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IN YOUR HEARTS AND MINDS. AND I KNOW COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER DOESN'T LIKE IT WHEN I ASSUME. BUT THE NEXT ONE IS ABOUT TRYING TO GET THE MAYOR'S EMAILS BETWEEN AN INDIVIDUAL AND HIM IN A VERY SPECIFIC TIME FRAME. IT REALLY FEELS LOOK A GOTCHA. SOMEONE WHO, YOU KNOW, RECENTLY COUNCICOUNCILMEMBER EATON RAN AT IN A COMPETITIVE PRIMARY. I -- THE EXAMPLES YOU GIVE ARE GOOD AND HAVE MERIT BUT WHEN IT'S IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED UP BY SOMETHING THAT JUST FEELS SO POLITICALLY MOTIVATED, IT'S JUST HARD TO TAKE IT THAT EARNESTLY. BUT WE CAN ADDRESS DC-3 WHEN WE GET TO IT.
01:35:59.042: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? I'M GOING VOTE IN FAVOR OF IT, ALTHOUGH AS I HEAR THE RATIONALE FOR IT, I THINK IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN BETTER ARTICULATED TO ASK FOR MAYBE A DESCRIPTION OF WHEN COUNCILMEMBER REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION FALL UNDER FOIA -- A POLICY RELATED TO WHEN COUNCILMEMBER REQUESTS FALL UNDER FOIA AND WHEN THEY DO NOT. IT SEEMS LIKE WHEN THEY FALL UNDER FOIA, WE SHOULD PAY OR FEES. WHEN IT FALLS UNDER, YOU KNOW, US CONDUCTING OUR REGULAR AND ORDINARY DUTIES, IT'S -- AND WE ARE NOT ASKING FOR -- AS A PROXY FOR A THIRD-PARTY, IT SEEMS REASONABLE THAT WE SHOULD NOT. BUT THAT, I GUESS, WILL BE A TOPIC FOR ANOTHER DAY WHEN THE ADMINISTRATOR AND ATTORNEY COME BACK TO US WITH THEIR WISDOM ON THIS POINT. FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
01:36:58.868: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES.
01:36:59.469: >> Councilmember Grand: NO.
01:37:00.070: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES.
01:37:03.106: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
01:37:03.606: >> Councilmember Eaton: YES.
01:37:04.240: >> Councilmember Nelson:  YES.
01:37:07.110: >> Councilmember Smith: YES.
01:37:08.211: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES.
01:37:09.846: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES.
01:37:10.847: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES.
01:37:12.849: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES.
01:37:14.451: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION CARRIES.
01:37:18.588: >> Mayor Taylor: DC-3 AND THEN WE'LL TAKE A BREAK. RESOLUTION TO WAIVE FEES ASSOCIATED WITH FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT, FOIA REQUEST 2147. MOVED BY EATON AND SECONDED BY RAMLAWI. DISCUSSION OF DC-3. COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
01:37:35.405: >> Councilmember Eaton: AS MY UNDERSTANDING SOMEONE HAS ASKED FOR A POSTPONEMENT OF THIS. IS THAT CORRECT?
01:37:41.111: >> THAT IS CORRECT.
01:37:43.313: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER SMITH?
01:37:45.015: >> Councilmember Smith: SO IN DISCUSSING THIS WITH THE -- MR. POSTEMA AND IN THINKING ABOUT IT, THIS IS SO CLEARLY TIED TO DC-2 THAT I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT WE POSTPONE THE MATTER ON THIS ACTION UNTIL WE HAVE RECEIVED THAT ADVICE THAT'S PUT FORTH IN DC-2. SO I WOULD MOVE TO POSTPONE THIS UNTIL WE RECEIVE THE REPORT OUTLINED IN DC-2.
01:38:13.109: >> Mayor Taylor: THAT SOUNDS EQUIVALENT TO A TABLING RATHER THAN AIRPOSTS PONEMENT BECAUSE IT'S -- A POSTPONEMENT, BECAUSE IT'S NOT A DATE CERTAIN.
01:38:27.290: >> Councilmember Eaton: I WOULD PREFER A DATE CERTAIN.
01:38:31.294: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER SMITH, DO YOU HAVE A DATE --
01:38:33.129: >> IT WAS 90 DAYS.
01:38:34.964: >> Councilmember Smith: 90 DAYS?
01:38:37.867: >> Mayor Taylor: SO THAT'S -- THE FIRST MEETING IN THE NEW YEAR?
01:38:43.373: >> Councilmember Smith: YES. THAT SOUNDS GOOD TO ME. STEVEN, YOUR --
01:38:47.210: >> City Admin. Lazarus: IT'S REALLY UP TO YOU. THE ADMINISTRATE --
01:38:50.747: >> City Atty. Postema: IT'S REALLY UP TO YOU. THE ADMINISTRATOR HAS LOOKED AT THE OTHER ISSUE. IT MAY BE TIED TO THE OTHER ISSUE. I CAN PARSE OUT -- I CAN MAKE THE ANALYSIS ON THE OTHER ONE FASTER THAN THE OVERALL ONE BUT IT MIGHT BE RELATED. THAT'S ALL. SO I'M NOT -- IT'S REALLY WHATEVER THE BODY FEELS COMFORTABLE WITH. I -- AUGUST IS NOT A PRETTY MONTH RIGHT NOW FOR ME. SO WHATEVER TIME FRAME YOU PUT IN HERE, I CAN WORK WITH.
01:39:19.442: >> Councilmember Smith: SO YOU
01:39:20.243: >> Councilmember Eaton: ON THIS PARTICULAR RESOLUTION, WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO POSTPONE IT TO THE SECOND MEETING IN SEPTEMBER?
01:39:30.053: >> City Atty. Postema: THAT WOULD BE FINE.
01:39:34.557: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER SMITH?
01:39:36.893: >> Councilmember Smith: SECOND MEETING IN SEPTEMBER.
01:39:43.099: >> Councilmember Eaton: SECOND.
01:39:43.766: >> Mayor Taylor: I DON'T KNOW IF COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER SHOULD BE VOTING ON THIS MATTER.
01:39:46.503: >> Councilmember Grand: IT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING --
01:39:53.076: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WILL RECUSE MYSELF FROM VOTING. I HAVE TO ASK FOR THE FOREBEARENCE OF MY COLLEAGUES TO RECLUSE MYSELF.
01:40:01.151: >> Councilmember Grand: I THINK HE HAS A DIRECT FINANCIAL INTEREST IN THIS MATTER. IT PROBABLY MAKES SENSE.
01:40:08.458: >> City Atty. Postema: WE CAN ADDRESS THAT WHEN IT COMES VOTING.
01:40:11.828: >> Councilmember Grand: I WAPPED TO MAKE SURE -- I WANTED TO MAKE SURE.
01:40:15.832: >> Councilmember Eaton: THERE'S NO CONFLICT FOR HIM TO VOTE ON POSTPONEMENT?
01:40:24.140: >> City Atty. Postema: PROBABLY NOT.
01:40:25.975: >> Councilmember Eaton: SO MR. HAYNER, WOULD YOU BE COMFORTABLE IF WE REFU RECUSE YN THE VOTE OF THE POSTPOPEMENT?
01:40:43.026: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES. THETHERE WAS NO REFERENCE TO ANY NAME, ANY RESIDENT, ANYTHING ELSE. I JUST WANTED TO SEE EMAILS FROM A ATTORNEY -- FROM ALL ACCOUNTS FOR 23 DAYS. AND I WAS TOLD THAT IT WAS $217 TO GO THROUGH AND REDACT THAT AND COUNCILWOMAN GRAND, YOU SAID THAT WE SHOULD JUST ASK FOR SOMETHING IF WE WANT IT, SO MR. MAYOR, WE CAN AVOID THE WHOLE CONVERSATION OF THIS IF YOU WOULD BE COMFORTABLE ME IN SENDING A SLICE OF THOSE DAYS OF YOUR EMAILS BECAUSE MY CONCERNS FROM COUNCIL RULE 18 IS CONTINUALLY VIOLATED BY PEOPLE AT THIS TABLE, AND MR. MAYOR, AFTER ALL THE GO-AROUND ABOUT THE NONPARTISAN ELECTIONS, I WAS INTERESTED IN WHO MIGHT BE WHO WOULD INFLUENCE SOMEONE PUTTING THE CHOICE BEFORE THE VOTER. I HAVE SEEN COPIES OF EMAILS FROM YOUR PRIVATE WORK ACCOUNT, REFERRING TO COUNCIL BUSINESS THAT HAVE BEEN SENT OUT TO THE COMMUNITY. I KNOW AT LEAST ONE PERSON, MR. MAYOR, YOU HAVE BEEN USING YOUR PRIVATE EMAIL ACCOUNT AND I WANTED TO SEE IT AND I WANTED TO CONFIRM IT AND SEE WHO YOU ARE TALKING TO. COUNCIL RULE 18 SAYS COUNCILMEMBERS SHALL USE THE CITY ELECTRONIC EMAIL SYSTEM FOR ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS OF CITY BUSINESS. AND I KNOW IT'S LAWYERS LIKE TO PLACE SEMANTICS WITH THE WORD "SHALL" BUT IN THE 34 PAGES, SHALL IS USED 255 TIMES AND IN EVERY SINGLE USE, INCLUDING THIS ONE, I BELIEVE, THE DEFINITION IS MUST OR WILL. SHALL MEANING MUST, INDICATING A REQUIREMENT. LIKE A CODE OF THE FEDERAL REGISTRY. SHALL MEANS HAS A DUTY TO. AND SO NOT ONLY AM I INTERESTED IN SEEING THOSE EMAILS AND CONFIRMING AT LEAST ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES IS VIOLATING COUNCIL RULE 18, BUT I'M INTERESTED IN SUGGESTING TO THE RULES COMMITTEE THAT WE GO THROUGH OUR 34-PAGES OF RULES AND MAKE IT NOT A SHALL AND SUBJECT TO SEMANTIC BICKERING BUT A MUST. AND I THINK THAT CITY BUSINESS SHOULD BE DONE ON CITY EMAIL, AND THAT'S WHAT I DO. THAT'S WHAT I ADVISED TO DO BY OUR ATTORNEY DURING OUR ORIENTATION AND THAT'S WHAT I CONTINUE TO DO. AND SO THAT WAS THE NUT OF MY FOY A. -- FOIA. IT WASN'T SEEKING ANY TYPE OF POLITICAL INFORMATION WHATSOEVER. IT WAS POSTED PUBLICLY AND I HAVE SEVERAL COPIES OF EMAILS THAT ARE NOT USING THE CITY SYSTEM. SO I JUST WANT TO PUSH BACK ON THAT AND IF PEOPLE WANT TO RECUSE ME FROM VOTING OR TALKING ANYMORE, I WILL HAPPILY DO SO. I DIDN'T ASK ANYONE TO BRING THIS FORWARD. I CAN SCRAPE UP $217 IF I HAVE TO.
01:43:37.767: >> Mayor Taylor: I THINK THE PROCESS IS THAT WE NEED TO HAVE YOU -- IF YOU WANT TO BE RECUSED, YOU NEED TO REQUEST IT.
01:43:47.043: >> Councilmember Hayner:  SO ARE WE VOTING ON A POSTPONEMENT? WELL, WITH MY COLLEAGUES' AFFIRMATIONS I WOULD LIKE TO RECUSE MYSELF FROM VOTING ON THIS.
01:44:03.426: >> Mayor Taylor: SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER NELSON. DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? STAND DOWN. FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE POSTPONEMENT? WE POSTPONED TO THE SECOND WEEK IN SEPTEMBER, AND -- SECOND MEETING IN SEPTEMBER. AND I HAVE FULLY COMPLIED WITH THE FOIA REQUEST MADE.
01:44:36.225: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES, I'M JUST -- I'M SORT OF TROUBLED BY THE LAST 15 MINUTES. IT TOOK A WHILE, BUT IT FINALLY HAPPENED. THE -- THE INSINUATION -- IT'S MORE THAN INSINUATION, BECAUSE I GUESS SOME PEOPLE ARE TACITLY ADMITTING THAT THESE TWO ARE TIED TOGETHER BUT WHEN I LOOKED AT THE AGENDA, I DIDN'T SAY THESE WERE TWO THAT WERE POLITICALLY MOTIVATED OR TIED IN A WAY THAT WOULD LEAD ME TO NEED THE ANSWER FROM ONE TO GET TO THE OTHER. AND I'M JUST NOT HAPPY WITH THE FACT THAT WE ARE GOING TO POSTPONE THIS FOR TWO MONTHS WHILE THERE ARE PRACTICES THAT ARE IN VIOLATION OF RULE 18. THAT TELLS ME THIS WILL CONTINUE, PERHAPS FOR THAT MUCH LONGER. AND TO HAVE THINGS DONE THAT DON'T -- THAT ARE NOT PRESCRIBED BY OUR CITY CHARTER AND OUR RULES, I WOULD BE COMPLICIT IN THE VIOLATION OF THOSE RULES BEING BROKEN. SO, YOU KNOW, I DON'T SUPPORT A POSTPONEMENT. WITHDRAW THIS OR VOTE ON IT, IN MY OPINION, BECAUSE THAT'S JUST HOW I FEEL. I DON'T LIKE WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON. AND I JUST FEEL LIKE I'M CONDONING IT BY POSTPONING IT.
01:46:26.068: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND?
01:46:27.303: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. I JUST -- I DON'T SERVE ON THE COUNCIL RULES COMMITTEE, BUT I HOPE THAT THE COUNCIL RULES COMMITTEE -- NOT THAT THEY CAN TAKE ANY DIRECTION FROM ME, BUT I WOULD REALLY LIKE IF THEY COULD DISCUSS HOW WE OPERATIONALIZE OUR COMPLIANCE WITH THIS RULE. YOU KNOW, IF I WERE ON THE RULES COMMITTEE, I THINK I WOULD BE PUSHING TO JUST SAY IF YOU GET AN EMAIL THAT'S ABOUT COUNCIL BUSINESS, IT'S UNDERSTOOD THAT YOU FORWARD IT TO YOUR COUNCIL EMAIL AND RESPOND FROM THAT. WE CAN'T CONTROL WHERE WE GET THE EMAIL FROM, RIGHT? IF IT COMES TO OUR PERSONAL EMAIL OR IT COMES TO THE COUNCIL EMAIL. WE CAN CONTROL WHAT WE DO WITH IT FROM THERE. AND IF IT'S NOT CAMPAIGN-RELATED, IF IT'S CITY-RELATED, I THINK THAT WOULD -- THAT KIND OF PRACTICE AND TRANSPARENCY WITH THAT PRACTICE WOULD MAKE IT MUCH CLEARER TO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TOO THAT IF THEY HAVE SOMETHING ABOUT COUNCIL BUSINESS, THEY KNOW THAT IT'S FOIAABLE. IF THEY DON'T WANT RECORD OF IT, THEY SHOULD TALK TO US ABOUT IT IN PERSON, RIGHT? AND IT JUST MAKES IT VERY SIMPLE. SO WHILE I'M NOT ON RULES, I HOPE THAT RULES WILL TAKE THIS UP. I'M COMFORTABLE WITH THE POSTPONEMENT, ALTHOUGH I WILL NOT PLAN ON -- I DON'T SEE HOW I WOULD SEE MYSELF VOTING FOR THIS. I WOULD ALSO BE COMFORTABLE VOTING NO THIS EVENING.
01:47:41.510: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
01:47:43.346: >> Councilmember Lumm: I'M OKAY POSTPONING, BUT I COULD ALSO SUPPORT IT TONIGHT. I -- I DON'T THINK IT'S A POSITIVE TREND FOR COUNCILMEMBERS TO START FOIAING, YOU KNOW, EACH OTHER'S EMAILS. IT'S NOT PARTICULARLY CONDUCIVE TO BUILDING A COLLABORATIVE ENVIRONMENT OR CULTURE. BUT I DO RESPECT AND HONOR COUNCILMEMBERS' RIGHT TO DO -- TO DO THAT WHEN HE OR SHE BELIEVES IT'S IMPORTANT OR NECESSARY AND SERVES THE PUBLIC INTEREST. AND IN THE RARE INSTANCE WHEN A COUNCILMEMBER DOES BELIEVE THAT IT'S IMPORTANT AND SERVES THE PUBLIC INTEREST, I -- I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THEY SHOULD BE CHARGED. SO, AGAIN, I WOULD SUPPORT THIS TONIGHT. THANKS.
01:48:29.925: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? I GUESS BY WAY OF FURTHER FOLLOW-UP, I GUESS THERE ARE -- WELL, JUST TO RESTATE, I BELIEVE WITH RESPECT -- PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO THIS FOIA REQUEST, I HAVE COMPLIED WITH IT AND TURNED THINGS OVER TO THE STAFF FOR THEIR REVIEW. I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THERE IS A LOT OF THTHINGS THAT WE ALL DO ON EMAI. WE CONDUCT OUR CITY BUSINESS AND WE COMMUNICATE WITH STAFF AND WE COMMUNICATE WITH RESIDENTS AND WE DO THINGS WITH RESPECT TO ITEMS WE ARE BRINGING FORWARD. WE ALSO, EACH OF US, CONDUCT POLITICAL BUSINESS, AND -- AND MAKE POLITICAL PLANS. THESE THINGS ARE NOT APPROPRIATE TO -- IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE TO USE CITY RESOURCES FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES. IN MY VIEW, THE USE OF CITY EMAIL, CITY RESOURCES FOR HIGHLY IMPROPER. AND, YOU KNOW, THAT'S, I THINK, A LINE WHERE WE SHOULD ALL BE VERY CAREFUL OF WANDERING. AND, YOU KNOW, THERE ARE -- THAT IS AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION AND THAT'S SOMETHING I THINK THAT WE ALL NEED TO BE MIND FULL OF AS WE -- MINDFUL OF AS WE GO FORWARD. FURTHER DISCUSSION?
01:49:47.136: >> City Atty. Postema: ARE YOU -- YOU ARE LOOKING AT -- OVER HERE, ARE YOU ASKING US TO HAVE THAT ANALYSIS AS PART OF THE PRIOR RESOLUTION? BECAUSE THAT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT --
01:49:56.746: >> Mayor Taylor: I DON'T THINK WE CAN CONTROL THE ADDITIONAL WISDOM THAT YOU CHOOSE TO GIVE US.
01:50:00.516: >> City Atty. Postema: OKAY. I HEARD WHAT YOU SAID, AND THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT THE FOIA AND THE TIME IT IS GOOD TO COUNCILMEMBER EATON'S WE'RE HAPPY TO COMPLY WITH DC-2 AND MAKE IT AS USEFUL AS POSSIBLE FOR THE COUNCIL.
01:50:17.233: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE POSTPONEMENT. I THINK WE HAD A DISSEN. LET'S DO A ROLL CALL VOTE.
01:50:29.812: >> Councilmember Lumm: NO.
01:50:32.481: >> Councilmember Grand: YES.
01:50:33.082: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES.
01:50:36.385: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
01:50:36.952: >> Councilmember Eaton: YES.
01:50:37.553: >> Councilmember Nelson:  YES.
01:50:39.889: >> Councilmember Smith: YES.
01:50:40.489: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  NO.
01:50:42.691: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES.
01:50:45.194: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES.
01:50:46.162: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION CARRIES.
01:50:48.864: >> Mayor Taylor: LET'S TAKE A SHORT BREAK. [ BREAK ]
02:01:29.069: >> Mayor Taylor: WE ARE BACK AFTER A SHORT BREAK. DS-1, RESOLUTION TO PROCEED WIT- DB-1, RESOLUTION TO APPROVE THE WILSON-BARRY ANNEXATION. ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED IT IS APPROVED. DS-2, ARE E SOW LOO US TO PROCEED TO A RESOLUTION RECONIF FIGURATION AND ENGANSMENT DOCTOR ENHANCEMENT PROJECT, MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM AND SECONDED BY ACKERMAN. DISCUSSION OF DS-1. COUNCILMEMBER LUMMS.
02:02:07.309: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. BEFORE DIVING, IN I DON'T WANT TO MENTION THAT I'M GLAD COUNCIL PASSED THE ARE E SOLUTION IN APRIL -- RESOLUTION IN APRIL, THAT ROAD DIET MUST BE APPROVED BY COUNCIL. THESE ARE IMPORTANT DECISIONS TO THE NEIGHBORS. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE ARE HAVING THE DISCUSSION ON THE ROAD DIETS. WHEN COUNCIL REFERRED THIS BACK TO THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION IN JUNE, I DIDN'T EXPECT THE PROPOSALS OR THE COMMISSION'S RECOMMENDATION TO CHANGE. AND THEY HAVEN'T. LIKE SOME CITY STAFF, THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION IS A STRONG, ADVOCATE FOR ROAD DIETS. THEIR COMMUNICATION TO COUNCIL READS A BIT LIKE A SAILS PITCH FOR ROAD DIETS' SUGGESTS ANY CONCONCERNS ARE EITHER BASED ON FAULTY PREMISESES, OR, QUOTE, LOOK OF UNDERSTANDING, END QUOTE. THE COMMUNICATIONS IS ALSO A BIT CONTRADICTORY IN TERMS OF PUBLIC FEEDBACK. IT SUGGESTS WE SHOULDN'T RELY VERY MUCH ON PUBLIC FEEDBACK FOR THESE DECISIONS THAT THEY ARE TECHNICAL DECISIONS, BUT THEN GOES TO GREAT LENGTHS IN STATING THAT THE SURVEY RESULTS INDICATED PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR ALL THESE PROPOSALS, WHICH ACTUALLY IS INCORRECT. THE SURVEY RESULTS SHOWED STRONG OPPOSITION TO THE GREEN ROAD PROPOSAL, AND TO THE ADDED PARKING ON TRAVER WOOD AND WE NEED TO BE CLEAR THAT THE ROUGHLY 60% SUPPORT SURVEY FOR EARHART WAS FOR A TEST, NOT NECESSARILY FOR PERMANENT CHANGES. ALSO I STOP SUGGESTING WE CONCLUDE THAT THERE'S SUPPORT FOR ROAD DIETS BASED TO RESPONSES TO GENERIC QUESTIONS LIKE, DO YOU THINK VEHICLE AND PEDESTRIAN SAFETY IS IMPORTANT? THIS PROPOSAL FOR EARHART IS TO CONVERT FOUR VEHICLE LANES TO TWO AND INSTALL ROUNDABOUTS AT EARHART AND GLACIER WAY AND EARHART AND WALDENWOOD. THE ANALYSIS PRESENTED BY THE CITY PRESENTED THAT A CHARACTERISTIC DISCOURAGING A ROAD DIET HERE IS THAT THE EARHART AND GLACIER WAY INTERSECTION LEVEL OF SERVICE WILL DETERIORATE TO AN E OR F CREATING AN E OR F LEVEL OF SERVICE IS SIGNIFICANT. AND IT'S INTERESTING THAT WE CAN REJECT PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT PROPOSALS THAT RESULT IN TRAFFIC LEVELS OF SERVICE OF E OR F. BUT WE ARE JUST FINE WITH THAT SAME RESULT IF IT'S GENERATED BY A ROAD DIET. IT'S NOT CONSISTENT. BEYOND DETERIORATION, WHEN YOU LISTEN TO NEIGHBORS AND READ THE SURVEY VERBATIMS. ONE THING THEY QUESTION THE NEED AND THE RELATION TO THE NEED. THE PROVERBIAL SOLUTION IN SEARCH OF A PROBLEM. LOTS OF FOLKS BELIEVE THE ROADWORKS OKAY FOR ALL USERS NOW AND IT'S NOT PARTICULARLY UNSAFE. MANY NEIGHBORS BELIEVE THE IMPROVEMENTS NECESSARY AND MORE LIKELY TO RESULT IN ENHANCING SAFETY ARE LIGHTING, SIGNAGE, PAVEMENT MARKINGS AND RESURFACING THE ROAD. NOT THE DRAMATIC CHANGES PROPOSED HERE. NEIGHBORS QUESTION WHETHER TWO ROUNDABOUTS SO CLOSE TO EACH OTHER ARE EVEN NECESSARY GIVEN THE OVERALL VOLUME OF TRAFFIC, AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, WHETHER THEIR INSTALLATION WOULD, IN FACT, IMPROVE SAFETY FOR ALL THE USERS. ALSO ON SAFETY, AS I MENTIONED IN JUNE, THERE HAVEN'T BEEN MANY ACCIDENTS HERE. ABOUT FOUR HERE OVER LAST FIVE YEARS. WHILE I CERTAINLY AGREE THAT ANY ACCIDENT IS A CONCERN, IT'S COMPLETELY REASONABLE FOR RESIDENTS TO QUESTION WHETHER THE LANE REDUCTIONS AND ROUNDABOUTS WILL REDUCE THAT NUMBER OR INCREASE IT AND WHETHER THE ROUNDABOUTS IMPROVE SAFETY FOR PEDESTRIANS AND CYCLISTS. ONE POSITIVE OUTCOME OF COUNCIL REFERRING THIS BACK TO THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION IS THE APPARENT COMMITMENT TO UTILIZE PERFORMANCE METRICS IN ASSESSING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ROAD DIETS THAT WAS CONTAINED IN THE JULY 15th STAFF MEMO. IN THE PAST, WE HAVE NOT HAD ANY FORMAL FOLLOW-UP ON ROAD DIETS. AND THAT'S BEEN A PROBLEM. TRAFFIC VOLUMES, CRASH DATA, AVERAGE SPEEDS, DELAYS, AND LEVEL OF SERVICE, PEDESTRIAN AND BIKE TRAFFIC, AND THE EFFECT ON PARALLEL ROUTES. WE HAVE NOT CONDUCTED THIS BEFORE OR AFTER ANALYSIS -- DATA ANALYSIS BEFORE, BUT CLEARLY, SHOULD HAVE. AND NEED TO GOING FORWARD. THESE ROAD DIETS ARE TESTS AN PILOTS. I'M SKEPTICAL THAT WE WILL INVEST THE RESOURCE TO DO THEIR FOLLOW-UP, BUT I'M HOPEFUL AND WE WILL SEE. I WILL BE KEEPING AN EYE. I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT WE ARE NOT PLANNING TO COMPLETE THE ANALYSIS RELATED TO THE VEHICLE FLOW AND THE DRIVER EXPERIENCE THAT HO LOOKS AT TRAFFIC SIGNAL DENSITY, TRANSIT AND PARKING USAGE, DRIVEWAY AND INTERSECTION CONFLICTS. THAT'S AN IMPORTANT MEASURE, ESPECIALLY IN SITUATIONS LIKE THE GREEN ROAD PROPOSAL WHICH WE'LL TALK ABOUT IN A BIT. IT WILL BE IMPORTANT TO GET VEHICLE AND PEDESTRIAN AND CYCLIST COUNTS. I'M SKEPTICAL TOO WHEN I HEAR IT'S JUST A TEST. IT'S NOT NECESSARILY PERMANENT. I JUST DON'T SEE US REVERSING THIS WHEN IT COMES TIME TO RESURFACE EARHART. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR LISTENING AND FOR ALL OF THESE REASONS, I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING THIS TONIGHT.
02:07:45.580: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
02:07:47.515: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE PEOPLE WOULD REACHED OUT TO US. I DID GET A HANDFUL OF EMAILS FROM PEOPLE WHO COULD OFFER SOME REALLY SPECIFIC INSIGHTS ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCES ON THIS ROAD. I HAD TO DIG THROUGH QUITE A LOT OF EMAILS THAT WERE FROM PEOPLE WHO HAD SOMEHOW BEEN PERSUADED THAT PEOPLE AT COUNCIL ARE GENERALLY AGAINST IMPROVING SAFETY OR GENERALLY AGAINST REDUCING SPEEDS OR GENERALLY AGAINST PEDESTRIANS. BUT, AGAIN, I REALLY APPRECIATE THOSE PEOPLE WHO OFFERED SOME HELPFUL INSIGHTS TO UNDERSTAND THIS AREA BETTER. I DO -- I WAS CONFLICTED ABOUT THIS AREA UNTIL I VISITED IT TWICE. I HAVE HEARD SOME MIXED MESSAGES ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THIS AREA -- WE'RE IMPROVING IT TO INTRODUCE BIKE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S NEEDED OR WHETHER THAT'S NOT AP AN ISSUE. IT'S PROBLEMATIC. I DON'T THINK OUR GOALS ARE VERY CLEAR. MY BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH THIS RECONFIGURATION IS THE ROUNDABOUTS BECAUSE WHEN I SEE IN THAT AREA IS AN APPLICATION OF ROUNDABOUTS WHEN WE HAVE A VISIBILITY PROBLEM, AND THAT'S NOT -- I DON'T SEE THAT AS A HELPFUL SOLUTION AT ALL, AND I HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EXPERIENCE WITH ROUNDABOUTS. EI QUITE ENJOYED THEM FOR THE FOUR YEARS I LIVED IN THE U.K. I DON'T THINK I ENCOUNTERED VERY MANY STOPLIGHTS AT ALL, IT WAS ALL ROUNDABOUTS. I WANT TO THANK, I GUESS WBWC ORGANIZATION FOR SHARING THAT PETITION, THE PHYSICAL COPY BECAUSE I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO LOOK AT IT CLOSELY. AND I GUESS IT'S HARD FOR ME TO TAKE FEEDBACK FROM PEOPLE FROM LOS ANGELES, OKLAHOMA CITY. I WAS MOST INTRIGUED BY THE PERSON ON THE PETITION FROM OKLAHOMA CITY, WHOSE NAME WAS YOUR MOM GAY. I -- I DON'T SEE HOW I CAN SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL. BUT I WILL COMMENT ADDITIONALLY, I WANT TO THANK STAFF FOR THE FRAMEWORK THAT'S PROPOSES. I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT IT IS A TRIAL. I LEGITIMATELY I APPRECIATE THAT THERE'S A RESURFACING PLANNED TWO YEARS FROM NOW BECAUSE I THINK WE COULD BELIEVE THE POTENTIAL FOR REVISITING AND REASSESSMENT AND IT NOT BEING A PERMANENT CONFIGURATION BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT QUITE A LOT OF RECONFIGURATIONS HAVE BEEN PITCHED TO NEIGHBORHOODS AS TRIALS AND OH, WE WILL DO A REASSESSMENT AND THE REASSESSMENT NEVER REALLY HAPPENS. AND IT HAPPENED NEAR MY HOUSE AND I'M NOT UP IN ARMS ABOUT IT PARTICULARLY, BUT I KNOW SOME PEOPLE ARE, THERE WAS A PROMISE THAT THERE WOULD BE A REASSESSMENT. AND THERE ARE PROBLEMS WOULD HAVE TWEAKS THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO SUGGEST AND THEY HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT AND THEY WONDER WHETHER DID WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE FEEDBACK ON HOW THIS HAS TURNED OUT FOR US. SO THANK YOU.
02:10:50.131: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND AND THEN RAMLAWI.
02:10:51.933: >> Councilmember Grand: I WOULD LIKE TO THANK ALL THE RESIDENTS WHO DID REACH OUT TO US. I WAS PARTICULARLY IMPRESSED THE NUMBER OF RESIDENTS WHO LIVE CLOSE TO WHERE THESE IMPROVEMENTS ARE SUGGESTED THAT WE HEARD FROM. IT WASN'T -- YOU KNOW, I THINK IN ANY -- IN ANY PETITION THAT COMES OUT, YOU ARE GOING TO -- IT'S GOING TO BE SUBJECT TO A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF RANDOMNESS, BUT THIS -- YOU CAN'T -- ANYONE WHO HAS ONE, KNOWS YOU CAN'T CONTROL TEENAGERS. IT WAS HIGHLY UNUSUAL TODAY AND YESTERDAY AND THE LAST FEW DAYS WAS JUST THE VOLUME OF EMAILS AND IT WASN'T A CUT AND PASTE JOB. REALLY WERE MESSAGES FROM RESIDENTS THAT SPOKE DIRECTLY TO WHY THEY ARE SUPPORTIVE OF ALL OF THESE IMPROVEMENTS. I WANT NO THANK STAFF F -- I WAT TO THANK STAFF FOR COMING UP WITH LOW-COST SOLUTIONS. WE HEAR ABOUT DATA-DRIVEN BEST PRACTICES AND I THINK THIS IS A WAY THAT WE CAN GET THERE. THAT'S ALSO AT VERY LOW COST. SO -- I'M TROUBLED BY -- WHEN MEMBERS OF PUBLIC WHO ARE INCREDIBLY INFORMED ABOUT THESE ISSUES SAY THAT COUNCIL IS NOT FOLLOWING SCIENCE AND SOMEONE TAKES THAT AS A PERSONAL ATTACK. THEY ARE NOT SAYING THAT SOMEONE LACKS INTELLIGENCE. THEY ARE SAYING THAT YOU ARE NOT DOING WHAT YOU SAID YOU WERE FOR. IF YOU ARE FOR PEDESTRIAN SAFETY, AND BEST PRACTICES, AND IF YOU ARE FOR EXPERTISE, THEN YOU KNOW, WE -- I HEARD ABOUT ACCELERATING PEDESTRIAN SAFETY. AND THESE ARE DIFFICULT DECISIONS. IT'S NOT A DIFFICULT DECISION. IT WAS REVIEWED MORE THAN ONCE BY OUR TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION. IT WAS -- IT RECEIVED INPUT FROM OUR STAFF THAT HAS EXPERTISE. AND THESE ARE PROVEN STRATEGIES. WHEN I WAS HOME, WE WERE LOOKING AT ROAD IMPROVEMENTS. HE SAYS, JULIE, DO YOU KNOW THAT THESE ROUNDABOUTS, THEY -- THERE WAS A STUDY IN AUSTRALIA, AND IT WAS SHOWN TO INCREASE SAFETY AND IT REDUCED CRASHES AND IT -- I SAID, YEAH, IT ACTUALLY REDUCES THE SEVERITY OF THE CRASHES TOO. AND THEY DIDN'T SAY, WELL, WE SHOULDN'T BE DOING THIS IN NEW ENGLAND BECAUSE THE STUDY WAS DONE IN AUSTRALIA. THERE WAS GOOD DATA AND WE REPLICATE IT. WE DON'T HAVE TO HAVE THIS CITY-SPECIFIC DATA. WHEN I GO TO VACCINATE MY CHILDREN, I DON'T ASK THE DOCTOR, DID YOU TEST THE VACCINES ON KIDS IN ANN ARBOR? IF IT'S SAFE AND IT REDUCES CRASHES AND IT SLOWS TRAFFIC DOWN. YOU KNOW, IF IT MEANS THAT SOMEONE TAKES AN EXTRA 10 SECONDS TO GET TO WHERE THEY ARE GOING BUT IT SAVES A LIFE, THIS TO ME IS A VERY SIMPLE DECISION. AND I THINK THAT'S WHY WE HEARD SO MUCH FROM MEMBERS THE PUBLIC LAST WEEK AND THIS WEEK, BECAUSE THERE IS A LOT OF COMMUNITY SUPPORT FOR THESE KINDS OF ACTIONS AND THE MORE THAT PEOPLE LEARN ABOUT WHEN THESE MEASURES ARE IMPLEMENTED THAT THEY INCREASE SAFETY, I THINK THE MORE RESIDENTS THAT GET ON BOARD WITH THE FACT THAT IT MIGHT TAKE THEM 10 SECONDS LONGER TO GET WHERE THEY ARE GOING. SO I THINK IT'S TELLING ON WHERE SOMEONE STANDS ON PEDESTRIAN AND CYCLE SAFETY. [ OFF MICROPHONE COMMENTS ]
02:15:02.516: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
02:15:03.417: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, MAYOR TAYLOR. I WOULD LIKE TO ASK STAFF A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS ON THIS PROJECT. HOW ARE YOU DOING RAYMOND.
02:15:29.176: >> RAYMOND HESS, TRANSPORTATION MANAGER.
02:15:30.878: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. MY PROBLEM WITH THIS IS -- AND I WILL GO ON ABOUT MY EXPANDED OPINION LATER, BUT THE -- THE ROUNDABOUTS THAT COUNCILMEMBER NELSON HAS BROUGHT UP AND IT'S ALWAYS BEEN PECULIAR FOR ME. I DO BELIEVE IN SCIENCE. JUST PUTTING THAT OUT THERE. IS THIS NECESSARY FOR THE OTHER PARTS OF THIS PROJECT TO BE COMPLETED AS WELL? IS THIS ALL OR NOTHING WHEN IT COMES TO THESE ROUNDABOUTS OR CAN WE PUT IN THE OTHER PARTS OF PROJECT AND TAKE THE ROUNDABOUTS OUT AND HAVE IT DONE THAT WAY? AND NOT JEOPARDIZING SAFETY OR ANY OTHER --
02:16:27.068: >> WELL, I THINK, YOU KNOW, THE FIRST THING TO REALLY CONSIDER IS IF YOU LOOK AT THE GEOMETRIES OF THOSE INTERSECTIONS, I HOPE WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT THOSE ARE AN ATYPICAL INTERSECTION. THEY ARE GIANT, EVEN IF YOU GO TO GOOGLE EARTH, DO A SCREEN VIEW OR GOGGLE MAPS AND YOU WILL JUST SEE CARS KIND OF IN THE MIDDLE, IN THIS NO MAN'S LAND. IT'S A BIG ILL DEFINED AREA ABOUT WHO SHOULD BE WHERE, TRAVERSING THOSE INTERSECTIONS. AND SO WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE LANE RECONFIGURATION, AGAIN, YOU KNOW, WHICH WAS IDENTIFIED IN THE TRANSPORTATION PLAN, WHICH IS WHY WE STARTED THIS PROCESS IN THE BEGINNING. THERE WAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT THAT INTERSECTION AS WELL. THAT IF A ROAD DIET IS PART OF THE SOLUTION SET OUT HERE AND THE INCLUSION OF A BICYCLE FACILITY AND IN THIS CASE A BUFFERED BICYCLE FACILITY, WHAT ARE THE THINGS WE COULD DO TO LOOK AT AND IMPROVE THE INTERSECTION CONFIGURATION. WHAT CAN WE DO TO IMPROVE THE WIDE, VAST SPACE WHICH IS UNLIKE ANYTHING I CAN THINK OF ANYWHERE ELSE IN ANN ARBOR? AND SO ROUNDABOUTS, YOU KNOW, ARE A PROVEN SAFETY COUNTERMEASURE. JUST BY THEIR VERY NATURE AND DESIGN. YOU KNOW, EVERYTHING IS KIND OF A SINGLE APPROACH, AND EVERYBODY IS KIND OF CHANNELIZED IN AN AREA AND SO YOU AR REDUCE SEVERL DIFFERENT CRASH TYPES THAT OCCUR.
02:18:02.396: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I UNDERSTAND. THIS IS NOT A ROUNDABOUT INSTALLATION. THIS IS MARKINGS ON THE PAVEMENT WITHOUT ANY KIND OF PHYSICAL BARRIERS AS FAR AS -- MAYBE I'M INCORRECT.
02:18:15.209: >> THEY ARE DELINEATORS.
02:18:24.885: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: AGAIN, WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT WHAT WOULD BE A ROUNDABOUT IN A PERMANENT INSTALLATION. MY CONCERN WITH THERE IS, YOU KNOW, YOU SEE THESE THINGS GET KNOCKED OVER, HIT ALL THE TIME. I MEAN, THE WINTER MONTHS HERE, THE SNOW COVERING, THE MARKINGS, THE CONFUSION THAT COMES WITH THESE INSTALLATIONS, IT REALLY GIVES ME PAUSE ON WHETHER THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO DO, YOU KNOW, NEARLY $40,000 OF THE SPENDING OR DO I WANT TO FIX SOME TERRIBLE AREAS THAT ARE AFFECTING US IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEM AS WELL? I MEAN, THERE'S JUST SO MANY NEEDS THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE, WHERE WE CAN BE PUTTING $40,000, $50,000. THIS ISN'T JUST THE ONLY ONE. SO MY QUESTION IS WHETHER WE CAN TAKE THAT OUT OF THE PROJECT AND THEN LEAVE EVERYTHING ELSE. AOR IS THIS A FUNDAMENTAL PART F THIS WHOLE PROJECT ON THIS STRETCH OF ROAD.
02:19:28.582: >> WE COULD GO BACK AND REEVALUATE IT. I HAVEN'T REALLY LOOKED AT -- I HAVEN'T ASKED THE DESIGN TEAM TO SEE THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE TWO. FUNDAMENTALLY, I'M SURE THERE'S A DESIGN CONCEPT THAT YOU COULD COME UP WITH. IF I UNDERSTAND YOU CORRECTLY, ARE YOU SUGGESTING THE LANE RECONFIGURATION, THE ROAD DIET PIECE WITH THE BUFFERED BIKE LANES BUT WITHOUT THE INTERSECTION RECONFIGURATION?
02:19:54.542: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THAT IS CORRECT.
02:19:56.744: >> OKAY. YEAH, I'M SURE THAT'S TECHNICALLY FEASIBLE. WE COULD LOOK AT THAT. WHETHER IT ACHIEVES THE SAFETY OUTCOMES WE COULD LOOK AT IT AND SEE THE CRASH PATTERNS AND WHICH ONE THE ROUNDABOUTS ARE TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION. THAT IS IDENTIFIED IN THE REPORT, WHICH -- HOW LONG WOULD THAT TAKE YOU TO COME BACK WITH US?
02:20:32.613: >> I DON'T KNOW.
02:20:33.380: >> THEY WOULD HAVE TO EVALUATE THE GEOMETRIES AND WHAT THE --
02:20:37.851: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  SO THESE ARE INTERDEPENDENT CURRENTLY, THESE TWO PIECES ARE INTERDEPENDENT? WELL, THEY ARE -- I MEAN, THEY ARE PROVIDED AS PART OF THE SOLUTION THAT SEEMS TO ACHIEVE THE OUTCOMES THAT WERE DESIGNED.
02:20:57.338: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, THERE ARE OUTCOMES -- IT'S ABOUT THE IF I TOUCHEARY RESPONSIBILITIES THAT WE HAVE IN SPENDING MONEY AND PROVIDING SAFETY AND ALL THE OTHER PRIORITIES THAT WE HAVE THAT ARE PRESSING AND FOR ME, BEING ABLE TO SUPPORT SOMETHING THAT I SEE THERE'S A PART OF THIS THAT I CAN GET BEHIND AND THERE'S A PART THAT'S NOT. AND THAT'S WHERE I'M HAVING TROUBLE SUPPORTING THIS MEASURE AS IT IS. AND I'M SORRY I DIDN'T MAKE THIS POINT EVEN CLEARER SOONER BUT IF THIS WAS A WAY OF TAKING THIS OUT, AND I ASKED IF IT WAS POSSIBLE AND THEY SAID THAT STAFF WOULD BE HERE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. I WOULD LIKE THE ROAD DIET IN PLACE, BUT DOING SOMETHING ELSE -- I FEEL LIKE WE ARE EXPERIMENTING ON OUR PUBLIC. WE ARE EXPERIMENTING ON -- THESE ARE EXPERIMENTS. AND I -- YOU KNOW, EXPERIMENTS AND WE'RE SPENDING $50,000 AND I JUST FEEL THERE ARE -- FOR ME, THERE'S MORE CONCRETE WAYS OF SPENDING $50,000 OR $40,000 INTO PROVIDING PEDESTRIAN SAFETY. THAT'S THE PROBLEM I'M HAVING WITH THE COMMUNITY OR CRITICIZING OUR DECISIONS NO THE TO SUPPORT THIS TONIGHT -- NOT TO SUPPORT THIS BECAUSE WE ARE AGAINST SCIENCE OR AGAINST VISION ZERO. AND THAT'S NOT THE CASE. THAT'S THE CRUX THAT WE ARE OUT THERE. THAT'S THE NARRATIVE THAT'S OUT THERE AND THAT'S WHAT I'M HERE TO EXPLAIN.
02:22:38.372: >> City Admin. Lazarus: IF I COULD JUST RESPOND TO THAT. IT'S NOT STAFF WHO IS MAKING ANY COMMENTS ABOUT PEOPLE'S SUPPORT FOR VISION ZERO OR ANYTHING ELSE. WE ARE RESPONDING TO COUNCIL'S REQUESTS TO ADDRESS A HAZARDOUS SITUATION. WE GOT EMAILS LAST SEPTEMBER. STAFF CAME UP WITH A SOLUTION, WHETHER IT'S TRAFFIC CALMING OR ROAD DESIGN, THINGS ARE -- MEASURES YOU ARE PUT IN PLACE TO OPERATE AS A SYSTEM AND TO PICK ONE OR THE OTHER AND TAKE THINGS OUT, I THINK IT HAS TO GO BACK TO THE ENGINEER THAT DESIGNED IT. THAT'S WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER TODAY. WE BROUGHT THIS FORWARD IN PART BECAUSE WE HAVE A RESURFACING SCHEDULED WITHIN THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS. TO PUT A PERMANENT ROUNDABOUT IN WOULD BE A PRETTY BIG EXPENSE. YOP THAT PUTTING PILOTS OUT THERE OR EXPERIMENTS IS AI BAD BAD -- A BAD THING. IT GIVES US A CHANCE TO VALIDATE BEFORE WE MAKE A MUCH LARGER INVESTMENT IN AN AREA WHERE COUNCIL HAS BROUGHT US TO LOOK AT THE SAFETY ASPECT OF IT. SO THAT'S WHY WE BROUGHT IT FORWARD. WE BROUGHT IT FORWARD WITH GOOD INTENTIONS. WITH THE IDEA THAT COUNCIL WOULD DELIBERATE ON IT, YOU KNOW, OPENLY AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SEEING. BUT TO TRY TO PICK AND CHOOSE THINGS OUT OF DESIGN HAS ITS OWN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES.
02:24:07.895: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. I WILL RESERVE MY TIME. HAYNER, ACKERMAN, GRISWOLD AND SMITH.
02:24:15.369: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. IT'S DIFFICULT WHEN WE GET THESE FLOOD -- IT'S NOT DIFFICULT. IT'S TIME CONSUMING. WE GET THE FLOODS OF EMAILS. ONES THAT COME IN FIRST ARE THE ONES WHO ARE REALLY INTERESTED. THIS IS SORT OF MY OBSERVATION. SUPER INTERESTED NEIGHBORS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. AND WE GOT A HANDFUL AND I ASK THEM, HEY, COULD YOU TELL ME SOME MORE. COULD YOU SHARE SOME MORE ABOUT YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD WITH ME. I WAS VERY THANKFUL THAT A COUPLE OF FOLKS I, YOU KNOW, INITIALLY RESPONDED TO DID, INDEED, SHARE THAT. BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, IT'S ONE THING TO LIVE HERE IN TOWN AND YOUR FRIENDS LIVE HERE AND THERE. YOU HAVE BEEN ALL OVER THE PLACE. IT'S ANOTHER THING TO LIVE THERE, RIGHT, EVERY DAY. YOU GOT TO KIND OF LISTEN TO WHAT THESE FOLKS ARE SAYING. AND, YOU KNOW, SOME OF THE CONCERNS I THINK THAT ARE EXPRESSED HERE AREN'T CONCERNS ABOUT COMMON GOALS OF PUBLIC SAFETY. I THINK THEY ARE CONCERNS ABOUT WHERE DO THESE PROJECTS BOIL UP FROM? HOW DO WE PRIORITIZE THESE NEEDS? YOU KNOW, I HEARD SOMEONE YELL OUT VISION ZERO. ONE OF THE CORE TENANTS OF VISION ZERO IS THE IMPLICATION OF IT IS DATA DRIVEN, RIGHT? THAT'S WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HERE. IT EVEN SAYS ON THE VISION ZERO, CITY STAKEHOLDERS ARE TO GATHER AND ANALYZE -- UTILIZE AND SHARE RELIABLE DATA TO UNDERSTAND TRAFFIC SAFETY ISSUES AND PRIORITIZE RESOURCES BASED ON EVIDENCE OF THE GREATEST IMPACT AND NEED. AND WHAT I HEAR IS THAT THERE WAS SOME NEED BROUGHT FORWARD BY THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND WE PRIORITIZED SOME RESOURCES TO TRY TO ADDRESS IT. I DON'T KNOW IF IT WILL HAVE THE GREATEST IMPACT CITYWIDE IF REDUCING THESE ISSUES OR IF WE ARE JUST SORT OF APPLYING VISION ZERO APPLICATIONS BROADLY ACROSS EVERYWHERE WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. AND SO THAT GETS A LITTLE BIT OUT OF WHAT I ALWAYS THOUGHT VISION ZERO WAS, WHICH WAS THE GREATEST IMPACT LIKE THEY DO IN NEW YORK CITY, WHERE THEY LOOK AT THE WORST INTERSECTIONS, THE WORST CROSSINGS AND THOSE ARE THE ONES YOU FOCUS ON. YOU GET THOSE RIGHT AND YOU DO SOME MORE. INSTEAD OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT STYLE, BROAD BASE APPLICATION, ROAD DIET, EVERYWHERE. MAYBE THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT. WE KNOW THEY WORK IN SITUATIONS. IT'S BEEN PROVEN THEY WORK. BUT WHEN WE HAVE MAINTENANCE ISSUES AND YOU COME TO A CORNER AND THE TREE BRANCHES ARE HANGING DOWN. THE CITY TREE BRANCHES ARE HANGING DOWN OVER THE CORNER AND YOU CAN'T SEE ANYTHING. AND THERE ARE ALL OF THESE OTHER ISSUES IT MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO SAY, HEY, HERE'S $75,000 FOR A TACTICAL URBANISM EXPERIENCE. THAT'S WHAT IT IS. IT CAME IN THE STAFF ANSWERS, IN THE STAFF ANSWERS, IT SAYS, ARE THERE ANY ENGINEERING STANDARDS -- QUESTIONS FROM COUNCIL THAT REQUEST THE USE OF PAINT SUCH AS PLASTIC DELINEATORS SUCH AS THIS RESOLUTION PROPOSES? AND THE RESPONSE FROM STAFF IS, PAINT AND REMOVAL DEVICES ARE TOOLS COMMONLY USED FOR TACTICAL URBANISM, A GRASS ROOTS MOVEMENT USING SHORT-TERM PROJECTS TO ADVANCE LONG-TERM GOALS. THEY SAW VALUE IN EXPERIMENTING, ET CETERA, ET CETERA. AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE TACTICAL URBANISM STUFF. I LIVED. TTHIS.I STARTED A BIKE TEAM IN E 1980s. WE DID URBANISM AND TACTICAL THINGS IN THOSE DAYS. I'M MUCH LESS RADICAL CYCLIST THAN I WAS IN THOSE DAYS. AND WE STILL RIDE AS A FAMILY. I MY CONCERN IN VOTING FOR THIS YOU KNOW, I HATE THE IDEA OF APPROVING SOMETHING THAT'S FOR THE OF AN EXPERIMENT. AN EXPERIMENT ON OUR ROADWAYS. I HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE -- I HAVE SEVERAL DIFFERENT PEOPLE WHO WORK OUT THERE AT THE DIFFERENT HOUSING COMPLEXES AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND THEY CON BELIEVE THAT WE WERE CONSIDER -- COULDN'T BELIEVE THAT WE WERE CONSIDERING THAT. THEY SAID IT WOULD BE BETTER TO DUMP A PILE OF BRICKS THERE OR STONES THERE IN THE MIDDLE SO PEOPLE CAN'T DO WHAT THEY THINK THEY WILL DO IS PLOW OVER THE BALLARDS, RIGHT. WE HAD A THING IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT AT THE PICNIC, ANNE, AT OUR RIVER HOP PICNIC, WHERE SOME RESIDENTS HAD WAITED SO MANY YEARS FOR THE CITY TO RESPOND TO THEIR -- IDENTIFY THE NEED AT THE REALIGNING CHANDLER AND BARTON DRIVE THAT THEY NECKED IT DOWN WITH PAINT, THAT THEY WENT AND GOT STREET PAINT AND NECKED DOWN WHAT THEY WANTED INTERSECTION TO LOOK LEEK. AND THE CITY -- LOOK LIKE. AND THE CITY BLEW A GASKET. AND THAT TACTICAL URBANISM WAS NOT LIKED BY THE CITY. NOW WE ARE COMING BACK AND DOING IT AND PAYING 7 # ATHOUSAND DOLLARS FOR -- $75,000 FOR THE PLEASURE. I REALLY APPRECIATE WHAT PEOPLE HAD TO SAY ABOUT IT LIVING OVER THERE. I WASN'T REALLY AWARE OF THE SITUATION WHERE THE NEIGHBORHOODS ARE KIND OF DIVIDED BY THIS ROAD AND SO ON. SO NOW I'M SUPPORTIVE OF THESE SAFETY EFFORTS BROADLY BUT I JUST WANTED TO SHARE THOSE CONCERNS AND THANK YOU FOR LISTENING.
02:29:36.289: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
02:29:37.257: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. AND THANK YOU TO ALL WHO HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS PROCESS. THANK YOU TOO TO MR. HESS FOR YOUR WORK IN SHEPHERDING THIS THROUGH MULTIPLE PROCESSES NOW. YOUR WORK IS APPRECIATED. IT IS STAFF'S JOB TO ROOT THROUGH A LOT OF DIFFERENT INTERESTS, EXPRESSED BY A LOT OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE, WORK WITH 300-MILE NETWORK OF ROADS, WITH DIFFERENT CONSTITUENCIES CALLING FOR DIFFERENT THINGS, MAKE SENSE OF ALL OF THAT AND BRING TO US REALISTIC COMPREHENSIVE AND PROFESSIONALLY DESIGNED ENGINEERING DRAWINGS AND THAT IS WHAT YOU HAVE ACCOMPLISHED AND THANK YOU FOR DOING THAT. WE TALK ABOUT AN EXPERIMENT, BUT, YOU KNOW, THERE'S NO WAY ANY ANYBODY IN PRIVATE INDUSTRY OR ANYBODY IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR SHOULD SPEND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON A ROAD RESURFACING WITHOUT HAVING THE PRACTICAL APPLICATION TESTED BEFORE. AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE ARE AIMING TO DO HERE IN THE NEXT TWO PROPOSALS AS WELL. PRACTICALLY WHAT THIS DOES IS IT CREATES A SAFE ROADWAY TO BIKE. IT CREATES CROSSWALKS THAT CONNECT NEIGHBORHOODS. AND IT STARTED TO TEST SOME EXPENSIVE BUT IMPORTANT INTERSECTION IMPROVEMENTS LIKE ROUNDABOUTS. WITH RESPECT TO THE BULLARDS BEING KNOCKED DOWN. I GUESS FAIR CRITICISM. LET'S BRAINSTORM ON WHAT TO DO IF THAT TURNS OUT TO BE AN ISSUE. BUT I ACTUALLY DON'T SEE A TERRIBLE AMOUNT OF OUR LANE TREATMENTS BEING KNOCKED DOWN BUT WHEN THEY ARE, THEY ARE PUT BACK UP VERY QUICKLY. AND THE KIND OF PERSON WHO WILL DRIVE RIGHT THROUGH 3-FOOT TALL BOLLARDS WILL DRIVE UP ON TO THE CURB OF A ROUNDABOUT. IT'S -- YOU KNOW, WE DEAL WITH THE REALITIES OF HUMAN BEINGS DRIVING CARS BUT THIS IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE CURRENT STATE. WHEN IT COMES TO -- THIS IS NOT REAL MONEY TO RESURFACING ROADS. IT SHOULD GO TO RUN RFB OR RECTANGULAR RAPID FLASHING BEACON WHICH IS A WORTH WHILE OPPORTUNITY HERE. IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH A HUGE AMOUNT OF ROADWAY WITHIN A LARGER NETWORK THAT'S GOING TO GIVE SO MANY MORE PEOPLE ACCESS TO SAFE BIKING, SAFE CROSSING AND ALLOW US TO THE TEST THE INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS BEFORE WE HAVE TO SPEND THE SERIOUS CAPITAL PUTTING DOWN CONCRETE AND ASPHALT. SO I'M SUPPORTIVE OF THIS AS A PRACTICAL MATTER BECAUSE I THINK IT IMPROVES THE SITUATION TODAY. WE HAVE A ABSURDLY DESIGNED INTERSECTION. IF WE CAN MAKE A IT SAFER, SO I APPRECIATE THIS WORK. I APPRECIATE THE INPUT OF RESIDENTS NO MATTER IF I AGREE OR DISAGREE WITH RESIDENTS, I APPRECIATE THEIR INPUT. IT'S WHY WE DO OUR JOBS AND I'M THANKFUL FOR THAT. SO I WILL LEAVE IT THERE.
02:33:37.697: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
02:33:39.265: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WANT TO SPEAK AS A POLICYMAKER WHO HAS A NUMBER OF CROSSWALKS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. THEY ARE FOUR LANE TO THREE-LANE CONVERSIONS THAT HAVE WORKED VERY WELL AND I SUPPORT THOSE. BUT I WANT TO PUT THIS DISCUSSION IN PERSPECTIVE. COUNCIL APPROVED OVER $400,000 TO DEVELOP A NEW TRANSPORTATION MASTER PLANNING DOCUMENT. JUST LAST YEAR. IN EFFECT ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THE OLDER DOCUMENTS THAT WE REFERENCED TONIGHT WERE OUT OF DATE. THE PROJECT CONSULTANT FOR THIS IS FROM SCHWARTZ CORPORATION AND IS A LEADER IN VISION ZERO. NUMBER TWO, THE COUNCIL'S LATEST BUDGET INCLUDED A POSITION FOR A SENIOR ENGINEER WITH VISION ZERO AND PEDESTRIAN SAFETY EXPERTISE. IN EFFECT ACKNOWLEDGING THE NEED FOR SUCH EXPERTISE. THE CITY HAS NOT FILLED THAT POSITION. WE HAVE INCREASED OUR FUNDING OF PEDESTRIAN INFRASTRUCTURE BY MILLIONS AND YET OUR CRASH RATE IS NOT DECLINING. NOW, AN EXPERIMENT MEANS THAT YOU IDENTIFY SUCCESS AND FAILURE IS ONE DEATH A SUCCESS AND FIVE DEATHS A FAILURE? ENGINEERS DO NOT EXPERIMENT. THEY GO BACK TO MANUALS AND THEY LOOK AT PROVEN TECHNIQUES. ROUNDABOUTS ARE NOT A NEW CONCEPT. ROUNDABOUTS ARE VERY EFFECTIVE. WE HAVE THREE OF THEM ON GEDDES. WHY DO WE NEED TO EXPERIMENT? ALSO THERE'S A LITTLE SLOPPINESS OR MAYBE IT'S JUST WISHFUL THINKING HERE, BUT IT'S SORT OF LIKE IS THERE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A PIECE OF CHOCOLATE CAKE AND A PAINTING OF CHOCOLATE CAKE? I THINK SO. SO ARE WE USING ROUNDABOUT DATA, CRASH DATA AND ROUNDABOUTS DEFINITELY REDUCE THE SEVERITY OF CRASHES AND I WON'T BORE YOU WITH ALL THE DETAILS, BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE CRASH DATA WOULD BE WITH A PAINTING OF A ROUNDABOUT. SO WE CAN'T JUST MAKE THAT DETERMINATION. JUST LIKE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT A FOUR-LANE TO THREE-LANE ROAD DIET, THOSE ARE ALSO VERY EFFECTIVE. THEY REDUCE SPEED. THEY REDUCE REAR-END COLLISIONS, BUT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TONIGHT IS NOT A FOUR-LANE TO THREE-LANE ROAD DIET. WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IS A BOULEVARD THAT HAS TWO LANES IN EACH DIRECTION DIVIDED WITH THE GRASSY AREA AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PAINTING OVER ONE OF THOSE TWO LANES AND CREATING A BUFFERED BIKE LANE. THAT MIGHT WORK BUT ONE THING THAT WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT TONIGHT IS THAT EARHART IS USED AND GOOGLE DIRECTION FINDER, WHATEVER IT'S CALLED WILL DIRECT YOU ON EARHART WHEN THERE IS A CRASH AND A BACKUP ON U.S. 23. SO YOU CAN IMAGINE THERE'S A HUGE BACKUP AND PEOPLE ARE DRIVING DOWN EARHART. GIVEN THAT WE HAVE GOT TWO LANES OF PAVEMENT, ARE THEY GOING TO ONLY STAY IN THAT ONE LANE AND FOLLOW THE RULES? I DON'T KNOW. I HAD TWO PEOPLE IN PICKUP TRUCKS MAKE LAND LEFT-HAND TURNN FRONT OF ME WHEN I WAS IN THE LEFT-HAND TURN AND THEY WERE OVER TO THE RIGHT OF ME. WE HAVE A PROBLEM IN ANN ARBOR WITH ENFORCEMENT AND I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE TO THAT. SO WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO ACCORDING TO VISION ZERO? WE NEED TO BE LOOKING AT OUR INTERSECTIONS AND LOCATIONS WITH THE MOST SEVERE CRASHES. ONE OF THOSE IS HURON BEHIND RACKUM. WE HAD A SERIOUS INJURY ACCIDENT IN JANUARY OF 2019. I REALIZED THAT THAT'S AN MDOT ROADWAY, BUT THE CITY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR LIGHTING. WE DO NOT HAVE ADEQUATE LIGHTING AT THAT INTERSECTION AND IT'S LIKELY THAT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE ANOTHER SERIOUS INJURY BASED ON DATA, BASED ON SCIENCE IF WE DON'T PROVIDE POSITIVE CONTRAST LIGHTING AT THAT SITE. SO WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR?
02:38:16.476: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER SMITH?
02:38:20.146: >> Councilmember Smith: I THINK WE'RE -- AS I HAVE LISTENED TO MY COLLEAGUES DEBATE THIS, YOU KNOW, THERE'S JUST A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT I WOULD LIKE TO TALK ABOUT. ONE IS THIS CONCEPT OF LEVEL OF SERVICE AND LEVEL OF SERVICE GENERALLY IS A METRIC USED BY TRANSPORTATION FOLKS TO TALK ABOUT VEHICULAR TRAFFIC. THAT'S WHAT THE A, B, C, D, E, F, LEVEL OF SERVICE IS, IT REFERS TO THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT YOU MIGHT BE POTENTIALLY DELAYED IF YOU ARE TRAVELING IN A CAR. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE NOT BEEN SUCCESSFUL AT, IN ANN ARBOR IS COMING UP WITH A METRIC THAT LOOKS AT LEVEL OF SERVICE FOR ALL FORMS OF ROADWAY USERS, PEDESTRIANS, BICYCLISTS AND TRANSIT USERS, TO COME UP WITH A MORE INCLUSIVE METRIC. AND I THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO TALK ABOUT OUR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM IN THIS HOLISTIC WAY BECAUSE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM IF YOU BELIEVE THAT THERE'S A WAR ON CARS, I THINK THAT THE REALITY OF THE SITUATION IS WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MOVE PEOPLE MORE EFFICIENTLY IN THE CITY AND SOME ARE GOING TO BE IN CARS AND SOME WILL BE IN BUSES AND SOME WILL BE ON FOOT AND SOME WILL BE ON BIKES. UNTIL WE START LOOKING AT IT HOLISTICALLY, IT'S GOING TO BE NATURALLY SKEWED TO CARS BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY THE SYSTEM WAS ORIGINALLY DEVELOPED BY ENGINEERS. SO I REALLY APPRECIATE IT. I THINK IT'S A SOLUTION THAT IS WORTH TRYING TO SEE, AND AS WE TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT THIS IS USING BOLLARDS AND PAINT, YOU KNOW, OUR RESPONSIBILITY AS COUNCIL IS TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE WORKING WITH STAFF TO COORDINATE MAJOR CAPITAL INVESTMENTS AND MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THESE PROJECTS TO -- TO GET EVERYTHING DONE AT ONE TIME, AND TO MAKE THE SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS, TO MAKE THE ROADWAY IMPROVEMENTS SO THAT WE CANNOT INCONVENIENCING PEOPLE ADDITIONAL TIMES. I PERSONALLY THINKS TOTALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR US TO SAY, HEY, LET'S TRY IT THIS WAY BEFORE WE INVEST $100,000 IN THE CONCRETE OF BUILDING A ROUNDABOUT AT THIS LOCATION. I THINK IT'S TOTALLY REASONABLE. I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY APPROPRIATE AND THE WAY TO GO FORWARD. ULTIMATELY, WHAT I WANT TO STRESS IS OUR TRANSPORTATION NETWORK HAS TO BE FOR EVERYBODY. IT CAN'T JUST FOR PEOPLE WHO OWN CARS. I THINK ACT ACTUALLY WHERE WE STRUGGLE IS CREATING A TRANSPORTATION NETWORK FOR EVERYONE AND I HOPE WE CAN START MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION A LITTLE MORE EFFECTIVELY AND PERHAPS WITH A LITTLE MORE OPEN MINDEDNESS ABOUT, HEY, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO BE INCLUSIVE IN THIS DISCUSSION. SO THANK YOU.
02:41:42.281: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER.
02:41:42.949: >> Councilmember Lumm: I WANT TO ADDRESS A FEW QUESTIONS. RAMLAWI'S QUESTION TO MR. HESS ABOUT GOING BACK AND DOING MORE ANALYSIS TO SEE IF YOU COULD SEPARATE OUT THE ROUNDABOUT RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE LANE REDUCTION RECOMMENDATIONS. TO THAT, I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT TRANSPORTATION THIS A MAY 13th . THERE WAS A STATEMENT ON T THE EARHART WARDEN WOOD, THE LANE CONFIGURATION IS UNUSUAL AND IT WOULD BEING MORE AWKWARD. AND THEN THE EARHART WOULD BE MORE AWKWARD WITH THE LANE REDUCTION UNLESS YOU DO THE ROUNDABOUT AS WELL. I AM NOTING THAT TO SHOW YOU THAT THEY ARE INTERTWINED. I DON'T THINK GOING BACK AND COMING UP WITH SOME -- YOU KNOW, WHERE THEY ARE SEGREGATED OUT IS GOING TO WORK. ALSO IT'S NOT SIMPLY AN EITHER OR THAT YOU HAVE TO DO A ROAD DIET TO GET SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS. IT WAS NOTED THAT ENHANCEMENTS, INCLUDING CROSSWALK LIGHTING WOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE PROJECT. OBVIOUSLY YOU DON'T NEED TO DO A ROAD DIET TO DO THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. SO THERE ARE WAYS TO INTRODUCE THESE OTHER SAFETY FEATURES. AND THEN ADDITIONALLY, IT WAS NOTED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD THAT AN MDOT HAS DESIGNATED EARHART AS THE ROAD TO USE -- IT'S WHERE TRAFFIC IS REDIRECTED WHENEVER, YOU KNOW, THERE'S AN ACCIDENT BREAKDOWN, SOMETHING GOING ON ON U.S. 23. I ASKED STAFF ABOUT THAT OVER THE COURSE OF THIS, YOU KNOW -- THIS HAS BEEN GONE FOR A FEW MONTHS. I WAS TOLD THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN VERY OFTEN. WHEN I SHARED THAT WITH VARIOUS FOLKS I TALKED TO, COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD AND I LIVE IN THIS AREA. WHEN I SHARED THAT WITH FOLKS, THEY LITERALLY LAUGHED OUT LOUD. THEY SAID IT HAPPENS A LOT. THE DAY OF THE WORKSHOP ON THE APRIL 11th, IT HAPPENED THAT DAY, THAT VERY DAY AND TRAFFIC WAS REDIRECTED TO EARHART. SO YOU DO GET THAT EXTRA U.S. 23 TRAFFIC FROM TIME TO TIME SINCE IT'S THE DESIGNATED ROUTE. THE OTHER THING THAT WAS NOTED TO ME BY RESIDENTS WHO LIVE THERE IS THAT THEY -- THEY HEAR QUITE FREQUENTLY ON A REGULAR BASIS EMERGENCY VEHICLES, FIRE TRUCKS, H.V.A. AND QUESTION WE HAVE A -- AND WE HAVE A LOT OF CALLS TO -- IT WAS DESCRIBED AS JUST A ROUTINE -- THESE ARE FOLKS WHO LIVE ACROSS FROM GLACIER HILLS. IT HAPPENS ROUTINELY. SO ONE CONCERN, THAT WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT IS THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE TIME OF EMERGENCY VEHICLES AND RESPONSE TIME IS ALSO KEY. AND THAT IS ALSO ANOTHER OUTLYING CONCERN THAT HAS BEEN SHARED, AND I THINK, YOU KNOW, THAT'S AN IMPORTANT ISSUE TO NOT OVERLOOK.
02:45:39.151: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN AND THEN GRISWOLD.
02:45:43.589: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANKS, MR. MAYOR. ONE MORE THOUGHT IN RESPONSE TO THE SPECTER OF EXPERIMENTATION. ONE OF OUR MOST SUCCESSFUL WAS HURON AND FIFTH. IT WAS THE PRODUCT OF TESTING TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE IDEAS WERE WELL FOUNDED AND WOULD HAVE THE IMPACT WE WANTED TO SEE AND THEN INVESTMENT IN THE HARD INFRASTRUCTURE WHEN THAT THEORY WAS PROVEN TO BE CORRECT. WHEN IT FIRST WAS INTRODUCED WITH BOLLARDS AND CONES, IT WAS ON EASY EXPLANATION, WE WANTED TO TRY SOMETHING BEFORE INVESTING YOUR TAX DOLLARS. AND EVERYONE SAID IT WAS A GREAT IDEA. AND IT TURNED OUT TO DO WHAT WE WANTED IT DO AND THEN WE INVESTED IN THE HARD INFRASTRUCTURE AND NOW IT'S ONE OF THE BEST INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS THAT OUR COMMUNITY HAS SEEN IN A LONG TIME. IT'S BEAUTIFUL. IT'S SAFE AND PEOPLE LIKE IT. THE SPECTER OF EXPERIMENTATION, IT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD DO MORE. WE HAVE TAKEN A RISK AND NOW LEARN FROM THAT AND REPLICATE IT ELSEWHERE.
02:47:17.049: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRIZ WALD. COUNCILMEMBERGRISWOLD.
02:47:25.891: >> Councilmember Griswold: TWO OF THE ISSUES WAS SPEED ON EARHART ROAD AND THE NUMBER OF CRASHES AT THE INTERSECTIONS. I WOULD BE WILLING TO MOVE UP ACTUAL INTERSECTION IMPROVEMENTS TO THE SUMMER OF 2020 -- ACTUAL IMPROVEMENTS. IN GENERAL, ENGINEERS DO NOT EXPERIMENT ON A STREET WHERE THERE IS HIGH VOLUME AND HIGH SPEED AS THERE IS OPEN EARHART. ANOTHER ISSUE IS -- AND I HATE TO BE PICKY AND NEGATIVE, BUT LET'S GET BACK BACK TO VISION ZERO. SUCCESS IS MEASURED BASED ON THE CRASH RATE REDUCING THE CASH RATE. I WILL SAY THAT AT EVERY COUNCIL MEETING. REDUCING THE CRASH RATE. CRASHES RESULT IN DEATHS. THEY RESULT IN BLOOD IN THE STREET! LET'S BE VERY GRAPHIC AND REALIZE WHAT OUR GOAL IS, TO REDUCE THE CRASH RATE. VISION ZERO IS NOT ABOUT MEASURING THE NUMBER OF VEHICLES THAT STOP FOR A PEDESTRIAN. WE LIKE TO USE THAT IN ANN ARBOR, BUT THAT'S NOT PART OF VISION ZERO. ANOTHER THING THAT WE WOULD DO IF YOU HAVE A ROAD DIET, YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE VOLUME OF TRAFFIC BEFORE THE ROAD DIET, THE VOLUME OF TRAFFIC AFTER THE ROAD DIET, AND YOU HAVE TO DETERMINE THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. HOW MANY VEHICLES ARE GOING SOMEWHERE ELSE BECAUSE YOU GOT A SQUEEZE POINT? AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT THAT'S A BAD THING AT KERRYTOWN, BUT WE HAVE TO DOT COMPLETE ANALYSIS. -- DO THE COMPLETE ANALYSIS. AND WHAT PEOPLE ARE TELLING ME IS THAT DELIVERY DRIVERS ARE GOING THROUGH NEIGHBORHOODS AROUND NORTH MAPLE BECAUSE THAT'S HOW THEY ARE BEING ROUTED BY THESE ONLINE ROUTING SYSTEMS. WE HAVE TO CONSIDER ALL OF THE CONSEQUENCES BEFORE WE SAY SOMETHING IS SUCCESSFUL OR NOT. AGAIN, WE NEED TO REDUCE THE CRASHES.
02:49:38.524: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
02:49:39.391: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. JUST ANOTHER QUICK QUESTION, I HOPE, FOR STAFF, MR. HESS. THANKS AGAIN FOR PUTTING THE TIME AND ENERGY INTO THIS AND TAKING ALL OF THESE QUESTIONS. HAS AN EXPERIMENTAL ROUNDABOUT EVER ON USED IN ANN ARBOR? AND WHEN WE CALL THIS EXPERIMENTAL, IS THERE A NEW METHOD?
02:50:14.927: >> I THINK THE IDEA HERE -- TO THE POINT THAT COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD JUST MENTIONED, THIS WOULD GIVE US THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEASURE THE DATA BEFORE, WHICH WE HAVE -- WHEN YOU HAVE IN YOUR PACKET AND MEASURE AFTERWARDS. ANY OF THOSE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. THE MEASURES WE WERE MEASURING WAS SET BY COUNCIL. SO EVERYTHING IN THE PACKET WAS SET IN THE RESOLUTION LAST YEAR ABOUT WHAT NEEDS TO BE REPORTED TO COUNCIL. SO IF THERE ARE OTHER THINGS WE NEED TO REPORT ON, TELL US. WE WILL REPORT ON THOSE. SO THE QUESTION IS HAVE WE EVER DONE AN EXPERIMENTAL ROUNDABOUT. I DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE EVER DONE AN EXPERIMENTAL ROUNDABOUT, BUT THIS IS DESIGNED TO ENGINEERING STANDARDS. SO THE -- YOU KNOW, IT'S DESIGNED WITH LOOKING AT TRUCK TURNING RADIUSES AND US ABOUT AG RADII. AND IT'S DESIGNED TO ASHTO STANDARDS AND IT'S NOT IMPLEMENTED BY CONCRETE BECAUSE IT ALLOWS US TO ASSESS THE BEFORE, WHICH YOU HAVE THE DATA AND THE AFTER, UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES BEFORE YOU MAKE A HUGE CAPITAL INVESTMENT. SO THAT'S WHAT THIS OPPORTUNITY PROVIDES US.
02:51:35.140: >> GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE. I'M CYNTHIA REDDINGER. I'M ONE OF THE TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERS. I WANTED TO ADD THING. WE HAVE A LOCATION ON PITTSFIELD BOULEVARD, WHERE A ROUNDABOUT WAS IMPLEMENTED PREDOMINANTLY WITH PAINT, WHICH IS NOT EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING IN THIS LOCATION BECAUSE WE ARE PROPOSING PAVEMENT MARKINGS AND VERTICAL DELINEATION. BUT IT IS A SIMILAR LOCATION. THE CENTRAL ISLAND IS IN PLACE, BUT THE OTHER ISLANDS ARE IN PAINT.
02:52:15.781: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. RAMLAWI, YOU STILL HAVE THE FLOOR.
02:52:16.982: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU.
02:52:20.018: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
02:52:20.953: >> Councilmember Bannister:  I HAD A QUICK QUESTION FOR STAFF. I MENTIONED THAT EARHART IS GOING TO BE REPAVED IN TWO YEARS. ONE YEAR? TWO YEARS?
02:52:37.736: >> IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN, THE LATEST C.I.P. HAS IT IN 2023, IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN. IN ONE OF THE MEMOS IT MENTIONED IN 2021, BUT LATER IT'S 2023. I BELIEVE 2023 IS THE MOST RECENT NUMBER.
02:52:50.616: >> Councilmember Bannister: AND DOES THAT IMPLY THAT IT'S IN REALLY BAD SHAPE? DANGEROUS FOR BICYCLES AND THINGS LIKE THAT.
02:53:02.060: >> ANY OF THE RO ROADS ON -- WE HAVE A P.A.S.E.R. RATING. THERE'S A SIM WH -- SYSTEM WHERE ASSESS THE. THE TRAVER WOOD AND GREEN, YOU KNOW WHERE THIS YEAR, THEY ARE CURRENTLY SCHEDULED TO BE RESURFACED THIS YEAR. WE WILL GET TO THOSE IN A MINUTE. BUT THOSE ARE SO -- SO THEY ARE IN THE QUEUE, EARHART IS IN THE QUEUE FOR RESURFACING.
02:53:31.690: >> Councilmember Bannister: OKAY. THE VISION ZERO CALLS FOR PRIORITIZING BASED ON THE GREATEST IMPACT AND THE GREATEST NEED. AND SO IT WAS -- I'M CONCERNED THAT WE'RE SPENDING ALL OF THIS TIME AND ENERGY ON THIS PAINT WHEN THE BICYCLES WILL BE RIDING ON A DANGEROUS PAVEMENT. IF -- IS THAT HOW YOU MIGHT UNDERSTAND IT TOO?
02:54:04.957: >> WELL, I WILL SAY SO THESE PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY. RIGHT? SO WHEN THE FACT -- ESPECIALLY TALKING ABOUT GREEN AND TRAVERWOOD, THE REASON WHY THESE WERE CONTEMPLATED AT THIS TIME, IS BECAUSE THEY WERE UP FOR RESURFACING NOW. WITH EARHART, BECAUSE IT WILL BE RESURFACED IN A FEW YEARS, IT PROVIDES THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THIS TREATMENT, ASSESS IT AND THEN DETERMINE IF IT'S A PERMANENT SOLUTION. WE HAVE HEARD CONCERNS DURING OUR PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT ABOUT THE QUALITY OF THE PAVEMENT. AND SO WE WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT IT, AND WHETHER PATCHING CAN ALLEVIATE THAT. BUT IT'S NOT UP FOR RESURFACING UNTIL IT'S SCHEDULED TO BE IN A COUPLE OF YEARS FROM NOW.
02:54:48.767: >> Councilmember Bannister: OKAY. AND JUST A FOLLOW-UP ON THAT OTHER DISCUSSION ABOUT THE -- WHEN THE ROAD HAS BEEN DIETED AND PEOPLE ARE DIVERTED OPEN TO OTHER STREETS. PARTICULARLY WITH THE KERRYTOWN, NORTH 5th AVENUE PROJECT HAVE WE BEEN COLLECTING ANY DATA. ARE PEOPLE WHISKING UP 4 4th AVENUE TO AVOID NORTH 5th NOW?
02:55:21.433: >> I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER ON NORTH 5th. D. D.A. HAS BEEN GATHERING THAT. IN TERMS OF DIVERSION, I DON'T KNOW WHETHER DATA IS BEING COLLECTED. IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE IT'S STILL NEW. IT JUST OPENED. SO IT'S OFTEN VERY TYPICAL TO COLLECT BASELINE DATA BEFORE A PROJECT GOES IN AND THEN YOU WAIT FOR THINGS TO NORMALIZE UPWARDS OF A YEAR AFTERWARDS BEFORE YOU GO BACK, WHICH BROUGHT UP A QUESTION ABOUT WHY WE HAVEN'T SHARED THE RESULTS OF NORTH MAPLE. WELL, NORTH MAPLE HASN'T BEEN IN FOR A FULL YEAR. IT WAS IMPLEMENTED LAST AUGUST. I COULD GO OUT AND PROVIDE YOU DATA BUT IT'S SUMMERTIME. SCHOOL IS NOT IN SESSION. UNIVERSITY IS NOT NO SESSION AND THAT DATA WOULD NOT BE VERY VAPID. WE ARE PLANNING TO COLLECT DATA IN THE FALL, EARLY FALL, WHICH WILL BE THE YEAR MARK OF WHEN THAT PROJECT IS IMPLEMENTED AND WEEK SEE HOW WELL THAT CORRIDOR IS PERFORMING. THE PROJECT IS SO NEW YOU WOULDN'T HAVE AFTER DATA, IT'S TOO EARLY TO TELL IN TERMS OF WHAT THE TRAFFIC CIRCULATION PATTERNS ARE. THE THINGS HAVEN'T NORMALIZED YET.
02:56:32.637: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
02:56:33.905: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANKS. AT NORTH 5th, WORD ON THE STREET IS EVERYBODY IS GOING UP 4th. I MEAN WE CREATED -- IT'S NOT A GOOD OR BAD THING. IT'S PROBABLY A GOOD THING. WE CREATED A PEDESTRIAN PLAZA, BASICALLY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET. AND IF YOU GO ANYBODY WHO GOES BY THERE, MANY TIMES A DAY AND IF YOU LIVE ON OUR SIDE OF THE TOWN. WHEN SCHOOL IS IN SESSION, YOU SEE THAT THESE KIDS AREN'T GOING THROUGH THE LITTLE CROSSWALKS WE PAINTED. THEY ARE COMING OUT THE DRIVEWAY. THEY ARE COMING OUT OF THE TERRY TERIYAKI PLAIN. IT USED TO BE A TWO-LANE SOUTHBOUND TRAFFIC COLLECTOR. AND I'M NOT GOING TO SAY IF THAT'S GOOD OR BAD BUT THAT'S WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON THERE. OF COURSE WE CAN SAY CARS ARE STOPPING MORE. BECAUSE, I MEAN IT MIGHT AS WELL BE A FOUNTAIN IN THE MIDDLE OF THING THE WAY -- YOU KNOW IT IF YOU LIVE ON OUR SIDE OF TOWN! AND THAT'S A CONCERN. AND IT'S A CONCERN BECAUSE -- THE FOLKS FROM THE WALKING AND BIKING ASSOCIATION AND READY TO TWEET THAT WE ARE AGAINST SCIENCE. YOU ARE ASKING PEOPLE TO FOLLOW SCIENCE AND DATA AND SOME FROM OTHER COUNTRIES AND OTHER LANDS AND OTHER PROGRAMS AND SOME FROM HERE THAT WE DON'T HAVE FULLY COLLECTED AND AGGREGATED. WE DON'T KNOW IF THEY WILL BE SUCCESSFUL OR SAFER OR LESS SAFE. WE JUST -- I MEAN WE DON'T FOR REAL. LIKE, WE DON'T KNOW BECAUSE YOU ARE TELLING ME YOU DON'T HAVE THAT DATA. AND I DON'T SEEN CARE. TO SAY THAT WE NEED THIS DATA AND WE ARE FOLLOWING VISION ZERO BEST PRACTICES IS NOT REALLY ACCURATE. WE ARE FOLLOWING SOME BEST PRACTICES AND WE ARE KIND OF MARCHING OUT ON OUR OWN, JUST LIKE WE DID WITH THE CROSSWALK ORDINANCE. AND SO THOSE ARE THE CONCERNS I'M HEARING FROM MY COLLEAGUES THAT -- THAT, YOU KNOW, WE ARE BEING ASKED TO MAKE CHANGES THAT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE OUTCOMES ARE GOING BE. I'M HEARING PEOPLE WALK ON THE SIDEWALKS AND THE PATHS AND THINGS, BECAUSE I DON'T REMEMBER WANTS TO BE IN THE STREETS AT THE SPEEDS, OBVIOUSLY. NOW WE WILL ATTEMPT TO LOWER THE SPEEDS AND SAY GO ON STREET ON THIS CRAPPY PAVEMENT. AS A CYCLIST, I DON'T LOVE THAT. I FEEL BAD ABOUT THAT, BECAUSE THAT -- IT PRESENTS ITS OWN SETS OF DANGERS, SWERVING POTHOLES AND SO ON. IF YOU COME IN MILLER LIKE I DO, YOU KNOW HOW BAD IT IS. YOU KNOW THAT THAT BIKE LANE IS A BAD JOKE COMING IN MILLER INBOUND. AND THAT GETS A LOT OF USE. A LOT OF PEOPLE COMMUTE IN THE INBOUND MILLER, INBOUND PACKARD AND THESE OTHER THINGS. AND THAT'S WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR. WE CAN'T EVEN GIVE THEM A SAFE ROADWAY TO BE ON TO SHARE THE ROAD IN A SAFE WAY. I WANT TO EXPRESS THE I LEGITIMATE CONCERNS THAT THEY MAY OR MAY NOT IMPROVE SAFETY. I DON'T KNOW WHO PUTS THE SIGNATURE ON THE DRAWING. IF YOU SAY IT'S GOING TO, AND WE SAY OKAY, THEN IT'S ON YOU GUYS. I MEAN, IS IT? I WOULD NEVER RIDE ON EARHART BIKE LINE OR NOT. I JUST WOULDN'T. YOU KNOW, I'M A HARD WORE BIKER. I'M A SOMEWHAT HARD CORE BIKER. I'M AN AGING HARD CORE BIKER. THAT'S ALL. I THINK IT'S -- SO, YOU KNOW, I HAD THE PLEASURE OF HAVING SOME FRIENDS IN TOWN FOR THIS LAST WEEKEND AND MY FRIEND MICHAEL CRAFT, HE WORKS FOR THE PORT AUTHORITY IN NEW YORK AND NEW JERSEY AND HE DESIGNED THE PATH TRAINS AND ONE THE FOUR MANAGING ENGINEERING OVERSEEING THE REBUILDING OF THE WORLD TRADE CENTER SITE. SO WE ARE BUGGING AROUND TOWN AND HIS EYES WERE LIKE SAUCERS. HE COULDN'T BELIEVE THE STUFF THAT WAS GOING ON WITH PEDESTRIAN SAFETY IN THIS TOWN. AND THIS IS NEW YORK CITY! AND HE LIVES ON 23rd AND 7 7th. AND HE WORKS DOWNTOWN. DOWNTOWN! AND IT'S -- HE COULDN'T BELIEVE WHAT HE WAS SEEING, PEDESTRIANS JUST WILLY-NILLY. NOBODY CROSSES AGAINST A LIGHT LIKE THAT IN NEW YORK. THEY BELIEVE THE LIGHTS. THEY DON'T BELIEVE THE LIGHTS HERE BECAUSE WE HAVE EMPOWERED THEM TO SAY THAT THE CARS ARE GOING TO STOP FOR YOU. THAT'S DANGEROUS IN MY VIEW AND DANGEROUS IN HIS VIEW. I WAS HAPPY HE CAME HERE AND SHARED HIS CONCERNS. WE CAME TO A HALT WHILE STREAMS OF TRAFFIC ON -- NORTHBOUND ON DIVISION AT LIBERTY ALWAYS ARE HAPPILY, DRUNKENING CROSSING IN FRONT OF THE RED LIGHT. SAME THING ON MAIN AND LIBERTY, MAIN AND WILLIAM. WE GOT A DIFFERENT -- THIS IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF CITY. THINGS THEY DO IN AUSTRALIA MAY OR MAY NOT APPLY HERE. THESE ARE THE CONCERNS WE SHARE, YOU KNOW? AND YEAH, I WILL CALL THE QUESTION. LET'S MOVE ON HERE IF EVERYONE HAS HAD A CHANCE TO SPEAK.
03:02:03.468: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
03:02:04.602: >> Councilmember Grand: SO I JUST WANT TO REACT TO A COUPLE OF THINGS I HEARD AT THE TABLE TONIGHT. ONE, YOU KNOW, THERE'S JUST A LOT OF QUESTIONING OF EXPERTISE AND I UNDERSTAND THAT AS POLICYMAKERS, IT'S OUR ROLE TO MAKE THESE DECISIONS BUT TO ME, IT'S -- I THINK THIS REALLY PROVES WHY IT WAS A TERRIBLE IDEA THAT WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN APPROVING THESE PROJECTS ONE BY ONE TO BEGIN WITH. WELL, CAN YOU DO X AND NOT DO Y, AND IF YOU TAKE OUT THIS PART? AND I'M HEARING ABOUT ALL SORTS OF OTHER IMAGINARY PROJECTS THAT AREN'T BEING PROPOSED AND WHAT WE COULD DO WITH $40,000. WE'RE NOT FOCUSED ON WHAT THE TOPIC IS AT HAND THIS EVENING WHICH IS THIS IS A VERY LOW-COST PROJECT THAT IS ENGINEERED TO STANDARDS THAT ARE EXPECTED TO IMPROVE SAFETY. NOW THERE'S -- WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A NEED TO REDUCE SPEED. THIS IS EXPECTED TO DO THAT. AND I'M REMINDED OF SOMETHING THAT I HAVE QUOTED BEFORE AT THIS TABLE THAT MY FORMER COLLEAGUE SABER BARRY USED TO SAY, WHICH IS -- OR ONCE SAID THAT WE ARE EXPECTED TO INNOVATE BUT NEVER TO FAIL AS A CITY. AND TO ME THIS IS A LOW-COST WAY BEFORE WE MAKE A MAJOR INVESTMENT OF DOING THINGS THAT ARE IN LINE WITH INNOVATION WHICH I DO BELIEVE IS THE EXPECTATION OF MANY OF OUR RESIDENTS. SO LET'S TRY SOMETHING A LITTLE INNOVATIVE. IT'S LOW COST. WE HAVE HIGH EXPECTATIONED THAT IT WILL SUCK -- EXPECTATIONS THAT IT WILL SUCCEED. BUT OUR STAFF -- AS WE WANT TO MOVE FORWARD WITH VISION ZERO, AS WE WANT TO MOVE FORWARD WITH CLIMATE ACTION PROGRAMS, ALL SORTS OF THINGS, WE MAY FAIL SOMETIMES AND THAT'S OKAY. BUT STAFF IS OFFERING US A VERY LOW COST TRIAL BASIS BEFORE WE MAKE A MAJOR INVESTMENT AND ONE THAT IS LIKELY TO RESULT IN INCREASED SAFETY IN THE INTERIM. SO I HOPE THAT WE CAN FOCUS ON THAT AND NOT ALL OF OUR FEELINGS ABOUT EVERY OTHER KIND OF TRAFFIC CALMING AND VISION ZERO AND TRAFFIC SAFETY. I THINK WE SHOULD SUPPORT THIS PROJECT.
03:04:22.207: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THE PROJECT AND I GUESS I HAVE ONE OR TWO SUPER QUICK QUESTIONS WHICH JUST FOR CLARIFICATION. THERE'S BEEN SOME REFERENCE WITH RESPECT TO MDOT REROUTING.
03:04:36.187: >> YES SO THIS IS NOT IDENTIFIED AS AN MDOT EMERGENCY ROUTE. AND SO THERE'S NO OFFICIAL DESIGNATION BY MDOT AS SUCH THAT THIS PROVIDES THAT RELIEF.
03:04:48.967: >> Mayor Taylor: AND I AM I CORRECT THAT THERE'S REFERENCE TO EMERGENCY SERVICES. AM I WILL CORRECT IN THE COURSE OF STAFF BRINGING THIS FORWARD ULTIMATELY BRINGING IT TO TRANSPORTATION AND ULTIMATELY TO COUNCIL THAT IT'S BEEN VETTED BY AND REVIEWED BY -- LIEU THAT LENS IS THAT IS TO SAY THAT IT WILL NOT IMPEDE EMERGENCY SERVICES THROUGH THE CORRIDOR?
03:05:15.560: >> YES.
03:05:15.827: >> Mayor Taylor: I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS JUST AS I SUPPORT THE OTHER TWO TREATMENTS BEFORE US. IN MY VIEW, THIS QUESTION IS REALLY INCREDIBLY SIMPLE. WE HAVE ASKED STAFF TO PROPOSE TO US AN ENGINEERING SOLUTION TO IMPROVE THE SAFETY OF THIS LOCATION. THEY HAVE GONE AWAY. THEY THOUGHT IT THROUGH. THEY HAVE RUN IT THROUGH THEIR CALCULATORS. THEY RUN IT THROUGH THEIR SPREADSHEETS AND CHARTS AND THEY HAVE GOTTEN OUT WHATEVER SLIDE RULE IS THESE DAYS, AND THEY HAVE PUT TOGETHER THIS DESIGN THAT WE BELIEVE WILL ACHIEVE THAT GOAL. IT DOES NOT CAST IT IN CONCRETE. IT CASTS IT PAINT AND BOLLARDS AND DRIVERS THROUGHOUT THIS CITY, THROUGHOUT NORTH AMERICA AND BEYOND FOLLOW LANES AND BOLLARDS EVERY DAY. IT'S DIFFERENT THAN CONCRETE BUT THEY WORK FOR US. WE HAVE ASKED STAFF TO GO OUT AND DO THIS AND THEY HAVE DONE IT AND THEY BROUGHT FORWARD A PROPOSAL WHICH IS INEXPENSIVE AND WHICH IS, YOU KNOW, KEYING OFF OF SOMETHING THAT COUNCILMEMBER GRAND SAID, IS POTENTIALLY ITERATIVE. WE WILL -- IF THIS WERE TO PASS, WE WOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AND SEE HOW THE APPLICATION OF ENGINEERING TRAINING AND THE SCIENCE BEHIND IT, HOW THAT APPLIED IN THIS PARTICULAR CONTEXT. AND EITHER RATIFY THE SOLUTION IN CONCRETE OR MAKE IMPROVEMENTS UPON IT. EACH OF THOSE THINGS WOULD BE GOOD AND IN THE INTERVENING TIME BECAUSE I HAVE FAITH IN STAFF AND I HAVE FAITH IN THE ENGINEERING AND THE SCIENCE BEHIND IT, I BELIEVE WOULD BE -- AND WOULD AFFECT SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS FOR ALL USERS. THOSE USERS INCLUDE THE DRIVERS AND THE PASSENGERS IN VEHICLES. THEY INCLUDE PEDESTRIANS. THEY INCLUDE CYCLISTS. IT IS NOT A SOLUTION FOR ALL REASONABLE CONCERNS STATED ABOUT THIS LOCATION AND OTHERS. IT IS, HOWEVER, A STEP FORWARD FOR THIS LOCATION WHICH WOULD NOT AFFECT HARM. IT WOULD AFFECT GOOD AND DO SO IN A COST EFFECTIVE MANNER. I WILL VOTE FOR IT. FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE. STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
03:07:36.667: >> Councilmember Lumm: NO.
03:07:37.301: >> Councilmember Grand: YES.
03:07:37.902: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES.
03:07:40.671: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
03:07:41.272: >> Councilmember Eaton: NO.
03:07:41.873: >> Councilmember Nelson:  NO.
03:07:43.307: >> Councilmember Smith: YES.
03:07:44.142: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  NO.
03:07:46.544: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES.
03:07:47.178: >> Councilmember Bannister: NO.
03:07:49.514: >> Councilmember Griswold: NO.
03:07:51.549: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION FAILS.
03:07:54.185: >> Mayor Taylor: DS-2, RESOLUTION TO PROCEED WITH ROAD RECON FIGURATION PILOT FOR TRAVERWOOD DRIVE, FROM HURON PARKWAY TO PRELIMINARY ROAD. MOVED AND SECONDED. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
03:08:08.699: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I DIDN'T, I JUST HAD A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS BEFORE WE MOVE ON HERE. IN THE STAFF RESPONSES IT SAID THAT -- THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS THAT THIS CONFIGURATION WAS COME UP WITH, WAS THAT IT WAS RESPONSIVE TO REQUESTS FOR ON-STREET PARKING. WHO WAS THE REQUESTER?
03:08:25.650: >> SO WE HAVE GO GOTTEN REQUEST, MY UNDERSTANDING FROM THE LIBRARY AND THE ISLAMIC ACADEMY AND PEOPLE JUST IN THAT GENERAL AREA. YOU KNOW, THESE COME IN OVER THE COURSE OF TIME AND SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT, YOU KNOW, WHEN THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENTS ITSELF WE TRY TO FIND AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE RESPONSIVE TO THOSE REQUESTS.
03:08:46.704: >> Councilmember Hayner:  AND IS THIS A ANALOGOUS WHERE TRAVED CUTS THROUGH -- IT'S ACTUALLY WHERE TRAVER COMES THROUGH. NOT TRAVERWOOD. IT COMES OUT ON TO HURON PARKWAY? DO YOU KNOW WHERE I MEAN?
03:09:07.191: >> THERE'S A SIMILAR THING ON HURON PARKWAY.
03:09:12.864: >> Councilmember Hayner: OKAY. SO THIS IS THAT KIND OF THING? SO THOSE SPOTS ARE ALWAYS FULL! AND I UNDERSTAND THAT ONE OF THE -- THIS IS POTENTIALLY A SORT OF SUBSTITUTE FOR PARK AND RIDE LOT? IS THAT TRUE?
03:09:26.477: >> IT'S NOT AN OFFICIAL SUBSTITUTE. IT'S A POTENTIAL USE, RIGHT? BECAUSE YOU DO HAVE NEARBY TRANSIT. SO YOU HAVE BOTH THE AAA RIDE BUSES AND THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN BLUE BUSES GO IN PROXIMITY TO THERE AS WELL. IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO DO THAT UNLESS THERE AS A PARKING RESTRICTION PUT ON IT, RIGHT? THAT'S ALWAYS SOMETHING TO CONSIDER, BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT'S BEING INITIALLY PROPOSED.
03:09:58.276: >> Councilmember Hayner:  SO WE ARE NOT BUILDING OVERFLOW FOR GOOGLE THEN?
03:10:01.078: >> WE HAVE GO THE END NO REQUESTS IF GOOGLE.
03:10:04.215: >> Councilmember Hayner: THERE'S NO RESTRICTIONS ON THESE SPOTS?
03:10:08.719: >> NOT AT THIS TIME. BUT IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY.
03:10:11.022: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I'M TRYING TO GET MY HEAD AROUND ON HOW ADDING ON-STREET PARKING BECAME PART OF THE VISION ZERO TOOLKIT. WE TOOK THE ONSTREET PARKING OFF AND TRAFFIC SPEEDS SHOT UP. BIKE USE IMPROVED, I SUPPOSE. IT'S HARD TO KNOW BUT FOR SURE TRAFFIC SPEEDS SKYROCKETED ACROSS IN FRONT OF MY HOUSE. WHEN WE REMOVED ON STREET PARKING. SO I GUESS THE CONVERSE WOULD BE SO. IF WE PUT ON STREET PARKING, THE SPEED WOULD BE SLOWER.
03:10:50.361: >> UP WITH  OF THE MEMOS MENTIOS THE FRICTION. IT'S REALLY ANY SORT OF FRICTION CAN HELP TO SLOW DOWN TRAFFIC AND REALLY THAT'S ON STREET PARKED CARS AND THAT CAN BE OTHER VERTICAL ELEMENTS IF YOU LOOK AT THE TRAFFIC CALMING TOOLKIT:  OUR GATEWAY TREATMENTS THE PEDESTRIAN CROSSINGS, THE R1-6s THEY HAVE THE SAME SIMILAR CALMING EFFECT BECAUSE IT DRAWS DRIVER'S ATTENTION TO FOCUS ON THE ROADWAY AND THERE'S THIS KIND OF -- THERE'S A CONE OF VISION BECAUSE THERE'S STUFF IMMEDIATELY ADJACENT TO YOU.
03:11:31.068: >> Councilmember Hayner: OKAY.
03:11:32.236: >> PARKING IS  A STRATEGY.
03:11:38.609: >> Councilmember Hayner. THE GATEWAY. WHAT I'M GETTING IS PEOPLE COMING TO A STOP AND THERE'S NOT A PEDESTRIAN IN SIGHT. AND I GUESS THAT'S TRAFFIC CALMING RIGHT? THEY SEE A SIGN THAT SAYS STOP, STOP, STOP EVEN THOUGH THERE'S NO PEDESTRIAN. I MEAN DOES THAT COUNT AS TRAFFIC CALMING?
03:12:01.899: >> DEPENDING UPON HOW WE USE IT. SO JUST TO BE CLEAR, THAT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN, YOU KNOW, THE IDEA OF WHAT YOU ARE WITNESSING THERE.
03:12:10.341: >> Councilmember Hayner: OKAY.
03:12:11.075: >> BUT I THINK THE MORE BROAD SENSE OF TRAFFIC CALMING, SLOWING DOWN TRAFFIC, YEAH, THOSE GATEWAY TREATMEN TREATMENE ACHIEVING THE DESIRED RESULT OF SLOWING TRAFFIC DOWN AND YIELDING TO HIGHER COMPLIANCE FOR CARS STOPPING IN THE PEDESTRIAN CROSSWALK.
03:12:30.528: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I GUESS IF YOU ALWAYS STOP, YOU WILL STOP WHEN THERE'S A PEDESTRIAN THERE. I THINK PEOPLE ARE CONFUSED BY THEM. I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S TROUBLE WELL SIGNAGE BUT I SEE TONS OF STOPPING AT THE GATEWAY. IT'S LIKE A STOP SIGNS, RIGHT? AND CAN I ASK ONE MORE QUESTION IF YOU DON'T MIND? SO AS WE GO TO ROLL THESE -- THIS PROGRAM THROUGHOUT THE CITY, WHICH SEEMS TO BE THE INTENT AS ILLUSTRATED IN 2007 AND POSSIBLY IN THIS NEW ONE WITH WHAT MR. SCHWARTZ HAS TO SAY. THERE'S IN NEW YORK CITY TRAFFIC CALMING EXPERTISE COMING OUR WAY. HOW IT FAR DOES THIS GO INTO THE NEIGHBORHOODS? I HAVE BEEN WORKING UP IN A NEIGHBORHOOD ON THE WEST SIDE AT ASHONDALE. WE HAD SOME TEMPORARY -- THANK YOU FOR WHOEVER PUT OUT THE TEMPORARY SPEED SIGNS, THE SPEED LIMIT AND WHAT YOU ARE GOING. I THINK THAT HELPED WHILE THEY WERE THERE. BUT, YOU KNOW, WE ALSO HAVE THESE SITUATIONS IN WATER HILL AND OTHER PLACES WHERE WE DON'T HAVE -- WE HAVE, LIKE, CROSS TRAFFIC DOESN'T STOP. WHOOSH. AND IF YOU DON'T KNOW THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND YOU DON'T SEE THE BEHIND BEHIND THE OVERHANGI, YOU ARE THINKING THIS IS A FOUR WAY OR WHAT'S GOING ON? WILL WE LOOK AT THE UNIFORMITY OF FOUR-WAY STOPS AT BEAKS AND ALL OF THOSE UP THERE. I'M CURIOUS HOW FAR WE ARE CONSIDERING, YOU KNOW, TAKING THIS PROGRAM.
03:14:08.859: >> SO THE ROAD DIETS ARE SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIED IN THE NON-MOTORIZED PLAN. THAT'S OUR STARTING POINT AND THEN, YOU KNOW AS I MENTIONED EARLIER, THIS PRESENTED ITSELF AS AN OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE IT WAS UP FOR RESURFACING. THAT'S WHY THIS ONE IS BEFORE YOU TODAY. I THINK AS MENTIONED IN THE MEMO, THERE'S NO ADDITIONAL COSTS. IT'S REALLY JUST HOW YOU PUT THE PAINT DOWN ON THE STREET.
03:14:31.148: >> Councilmember Hayner:  ARE WE DOING SOME CURB RECONFIGURATION BY THE LIBRARY?
03:14:36.854: >> YES, BECAUSE THE ON-STREET PARKING.
03:14:38.923: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I SEE THIS DOESN'T NEED EIGHT VOTES LIKE THE PREVIOUS ONE DID BECAUSE THERE'S NOT FUNDING OUT OF THE BUDGET. WHO IS PAYING FOR THAT CURB?
03:14:48.766: >> IT WAS PART OF THE --
03:14:50.901: >> Councilmember Hayner:  SO LAST YEAR WHEN WE APPROVED, THIS WE ESTIMATED THAT THAT MIGHT BE HAPPENING.
03:14:56.774: >> YEAH.
03:14:57.041: >> Councilmember Hayner: OKAY.
03:14:58.008: >> TO YOUR OTHER QUESTION, IS THIS GOING INTO THE NEIGHBORHOOD? WE HAVE THE RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD TRAFFIC CALMING PROGRAM WHICH IS RESIDENT INITIATED AND RESIDENT DRIVEN. WE HAD A KICKOFF MEETING LAST WEEK FOR CREST. SO IF THERE IS A STREET WHERE THEY ARE EXPERIENCING CUT THROUGH TRAFFIC OR SPEEDS OR THINGS LIKE THAT, THEY CAN PETITION THE CITY TO COME AND LOOK AT WHAT SORT OF DEVICES WOULD BE APPROPRIATE AND IT'S RESIDENT DRIVEN. THERE'S A PROCESS IN PLACE. IT WAS UPDATED IN NOVEMBER AND THEY COME BEFORE COUNCIL FOR FINAL APPROVAL AS WELL. SO, YOU KNOW, TO ANY OF YOUR WARD CONSTITUENTS YOU CAN DIRECT THEM TO THE TRAFFIC CALMING PROGRAM FOR NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS.
03:15:39.917: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I'M GLAD WE HAVE THAT PROGRAM IN PLACE AND IT'S WORKED, AND I THINK WE MADE SOME IMPROVEMENTS TO IT RECENTLY. WHY AREN'T WE JUST KIND OF -- WHY DO WE WAIT FOR THE RESIDENTS? DO WE NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO JUST KIND OF ACT OURSELVES? WE WAIT FOR RESIDENTS WHO ASK FOR CALMING. AND THEY SAY, HEY GO THROUGH THIS PROGRAM. WHY AREN'T WE JUST GRABBING THE BULL BY THE HORNS, YOU KNOW? I'M JUST -- I KNOW THAT A THEORETICAL QUESTION. I APPRECIATE YOUR --
03:16:17.688: >> IT'S ALMOST A TOUGH QUESTION TO ANSWER. I THINK IN ALL HOPPESTLY, THE REASON -- HONESTY, THE REASON FOR THE TRAFFIC CALMING, IF YOU THINK ABOUT SPEED BUMPS AND RAISED INTERSECTIONS THAT EMPACTS PEOPLE VERY LOCALLY. THESE ARE LOCAL STREETS. SO WHEN I'M TRYING TO GET TO MY HOUSE, MY DRIVEWAY, WHEREVER, IS THAT SOMETHING I WANT TO DO. DO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I WANT TO DRIVE OVER THAT? SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S ENOUGH UNDERSTANDING AND LOCAL SUPPORT FOR THOSE WHEN WE MOVE THOSE FORWARD. AND SO ON THE FRONT END, THE PETITION REQUIRES 50% OF THE AREA THAT'S AFFECTED TO SIGN A PETITION THAT SAYS, YES, WE WANT TO EXPLORE TRAFFIC CALMING AND THAT'S JUST THE NATURE OF THAT NEIGHBORHOOD TRAFFIC CALMING PROGRAM.
03:17:06.670: >> Councilmember Hayner:  DO WE AGGREGATE POLICE CRASH DATA?
03:17:10.874: >> YES.
03:17:11.141: >> Councilmember Hayner:  AND THERE'S NO FOUR-WAY CROSS TRAFFIC STOP. IF THERE WAS A CRASH WE COULD PULL IT OFF THE UNIFORM REPORT?
03:17:18.282: >> MM-HMM.
03:17:18.582: >> Councilmember Hayner: OKAY. I GUESS I WANT TO LOOK AT SOME MORE OF THOSE. THANK YOU FOR ANSWERING MY QUESTIONS. WE'RE TRYING TO -- I GUESS I'M TRYING TO BUILD A BETTER UNDERSTANDING AND HOW CAN WE, YOU KNOW MAKE THE RIGHT IMPROVEMENTS AND DECISIONS NOW AND TO ACT IN A MANNER THAT'S, YOU KNOW, APPROPRIATE. SO THANK YOU.
03:17:39.803: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
03:17:40.904: >> Councilmember Griswold: YEAH. TRAVERWOOD, AGAIN, IS BEING JUSTIFIED BECAUSE OF THE CRASH DATA FOR A ROAD DIET. TYPICALLY FOUR LANE TO THREE LANE CONVERSION. TRAVERWOOD RIGHT NOW IS THREE LANES. WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING IS ON-STREET PARKING ON THE WEST SIDE, AND THEN TWO TEN-FOOT LANES AND A SINGLE BIKE LANE ON THE EAST SIDE. I DO NOT CONSIDER THIS CONSISTENT WITH VISION ZERO, BUT WE CAN INTELLECTUALIZE IT FOR THE NEXT 40, 50 MINUTES. ONE THING I WANT TO POINT OUT IS THAT ON HURON PARKWAY, WHERE WE HAVE ON-STREET PARKING THERE IS A BIKE LANE BETWEEN THE VEHICULAR TRAFFIC AND THE ONSTREET PARKING WHICH PROVIDES SOMEWHAT OF A BUFFER. IN THIS CASE, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE ON-STREET PARKING AND THEN TWO TEN-FOOT LANES AND THEN A BIKE LANE. SO WE ARE NOT GOING TO ACHIEVE ALL OF THE BENEFITS OF A ROAD DIET BECAUSE WE ARE DOING SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN A ROAD DIET.
03:19:05.856: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER LUMM AND THAN THEN HAYNER.
03:19:14.598: >> Councilmember Lumm: JUST A FOLLOW-ON TO UP WITH OF THE QUESTIONS, MR. HESS. I WAS TRYING TO RECONCILE -- I WAS WONDERING WHERE THIS REFERENCE TO THE REQUEST FOR MORE PARKING WAS COMING FROM BECAUSE I COULDN'T DETERMINE IF THAT WAS A MAJORITY VIEW OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND YOU SAID IT WAS THE LIBRARY AND NOT GOOGLE BUT -- [ OFF MICROPHONE COMMENTS ]
03:19:43.861: >> Councilmember Lumm: OH, OKAY. ALBEIT, THE CITY -- THEY TRIED TO ENGAGE FOLKS BUT THE RESULT WAS THERE WAS LITTLE FEEDBACK PROVIDED. I DON'T KNOW IF THEY HEARD FROM MORE RESIDENTS SINCE JUNE JUNE 17th.
03:19:58.175: >> WHAT WE CONSIDER THE OFFICIAL RECORD IS WHAT WE HAVE IN THE PACKET IN TERMS OF RESPONSES.
03:20:06.817: >> Councilmember Lumm: HUGELY STATISTICALLY VALID, I SUPPOSE. BUT THE CITY DID TRY AND THAT WAS GOOD. BUT THAT SMALL SAMPLE, THE MAJORITY INDICATE THAT THEY DIDN'T SUPPORT THE ADDITIONAL PARKING. THAT'S WHAT I WAS TRYING TO RECONCILE, THAT WITH THE -- YOU KNOW, -- WITH THE NEGATIVE SURVEY FEEDBACK AND THIS RECOMMENDATION. BECAUSE I -- YOU KNOW, I MEAN, WHY DO IT IF THAT'S NOT WHAT PEOPLE WERE REQUESTING? BUT I NOW UNDERSTAND WHERE THAT REQUEST WAS COMING FROM. SO I DO APPRECIATE THAT. THE -- YEAH, THE OTHER, I GUESS, QUESTION, I SUPPOSE -- I MEAN I DON'T PARTICULARLY HAVE STRONG FEELINGS ABOUT THIS ONE. I DON'T THINK THIS ROAD DIET POSES THE -- TRAVERWOOD POSES THE SAME CHALLENGES AS THE DIETS FOR GREEN AND EARHART. EARHART WOULD HAVE. BUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S HARD TO ASSESS THIS IF THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT TRAFFIC IMPACTS OR SAFETY RISKS BECAUSE THE QUESTIONS HERE ARE DIFFERENT. AND THEY SEEMED TO BE FOCUSED ON CREATING THE ON-STREET PARKING, HENCE WHETHER IT WAS NEEDED OR DECIDED BY THE NEIGHBORS AND THE IMPACT THAT THAT MIGHT HAVE ON CYCLIST SAFETY. COULD YOU JUST COMMENT ON THAT, COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD REFERENCED HOW THIS WOULD BE DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE HAVE ON HURON PARKWAY?
03:21:44.948: >> SURE. SO THE WAY THE CONFIGURATION IS CURRENTLY DESIGNED IS A BIKE LANE AS COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD DESCRIBED ON THE SOUTHEAST SIDE. IF YOU THINK ABOUT BIKING UPHILL, IT MIGHT BE MORE WOBBLY GOING UPHILL AND IF WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH ROOM TO PUT IN BIKE LANES ON BOTH SIDES, THAT'S ALWAYS KIND OF THE DESIRED APPROACH IS TO PUT THE BIKE LANE ON THE CLIMB. THE SHARE THE ROAD ARROW WOULD BE PLACE OUTSIDE THE DOOR ZONE TO MAKE SURE THAT CYCLISTS WHEN THEY ARE IN THE HOW ABOUT APPROACH, IT WOULD BE IN THE DOOR ZONE. AND JUST AS A POINT OF CLARIFICATION, WHEN SHAREROS OR PLACED, THEY MEANT TO INDICATE NOT JUST THE PRESENCE OF CYCLISTS BUT WHERE TO EXPECT CYCLISTS. THEY ARE DESIGNED LIKE A CHEVRON. THE CHEVRON ACTUALLY -- THE TIPS OF CHEVRON ARE WHERE -- IT'S INSTRUCTIONAL WHERE CYCLISTS SHOULD BE RIDING AS AN ENGINEERING CONSIDERATION AND TO BE ON THE SAFEST PLACE OF THE ROAD AS POSSIBLE. AND THIS IS WHY THE DESIGN IS PRESENTED THE WAY IT IS. ADMITTEDLY, WE DID LOOK AT BIKE LANES ON BOTH SIDES. THAT'S A QUESTION THAT CAME UP IN CAUCUS. IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE COULD LOOK AT, RIGHT? I MEAN IF PARKING IS, YOU KNOW, SOMETHING THAT IS THE STICKING POINT HERE, YOU KNOW, HAVING A BIKE LANE, THE BUFFERED BIKE LANE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ROAD IS SOMETHING THAT WE COULD GO BACK AND REEVALUATE.
03:23:30.654: >> Councilmember Lumm: I WILL SAY THANK YOU. COUNCILMEMBER EATON'S QUESTION ON -- HE ASKED HOW ADDING ON-STREET PARKING WOULD IMPACT CYCLIST SAFETY. YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW. I FOUND THE RESPONSE NOT ALL TOGETHER CONVINCING, EITHER WAY. I MEAN OBVIOUSLY MAJOR REASON FOR ROAD DIETS AND ADDING BIKE LANES IS TO IMPROVE CYCLIST SAFETY. WHEN I SEE A RESPONSE THAT DOESN'T SEEM REAL CLEAR THAT THAT RESULT IS ACHIEVED. IT DOES GIVE ME PAUSE IN TERMS OF THE WISDOM OF CREATING ON-STREET PARKING. THAT MOST OF THE SURVEY'S RESPONDENTS, AGAIN ALBEIT A SMALL SURVEY SO THEY DIDN'T WANT -- DEPENDING ON HOW THIS GOES, IT  WILL CERTAINLY BE IMPORTANT TO CONDUCT THE FOLLOW UPPERFORMANCE THAT WAS REFERENCED IN MS. REDDINGER'S JULY 15th MEMO AND, YOU KNOW, THAT'S' SPECIALLY TRUE FOR OTHER ROADS. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TRUE FOR EARHART AND CERTAINLY TRUE FOR GREEN WHERE THERE'S SIGNIFICANT TRAFFIC IMPACTS AND POTENTIAL SAFETY RISKS. IT'S TRUE FOR TRAVERWOOD WAS WELL. I WOULD SAY, I HAVE MIXED FEELINGS ON THIS.
03:24:49.199: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER AND GRISWOLD AND EATON AND THEN PERHAPS WE CAN HAVE THESE COMMENTS WESTBOUND SHORT AND MOVE -- BE SHORT AND MOVE THIS ALONG. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER. HANE THE PARK AND RIDES, THIS' A SUBSTITUTE TO KEEP THE CARS OUT OF THE CAR. THEY PARK ON PERIPHERY, THEY TAKE TRAFFIC DOWNTOWN.
03:25:11.555: >> YES.
03:25:11.922: >> Councilmember Hayner:  DOES THE D.D.A. HAVE ANY SAY IN THAT.
03:25:16.126: >> TO MY KNOWLEDGE, THE D.D.A. IS NOT INVOLVED IN THAT AND THEN M DOT ACTUALLY HAS PARK AND RIDES TOO.
03:25:23.333: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WAS WONDERING IF WE COULD -- IF WE CREATE THESE TYPE OF PARK AND RIDES AND THESE SITUATIONS, I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S OTHER PLACES WHERE THEY ARE FORECAST. MAYBE, YOU KNOW -- DO YOU KNOW?
03:25:37.814: >> IN THE TRANSPORTATION PLAN, THERE'S THOSE THAT ARE HIGH LEVEL AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE RIDE, THE AAA, IT'S LONG RANGE PLAN IN THE NEAR FUTURE AS WELL AND THERE'S OPPORTUNITY FOR COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE TWO TRANSPORTATION PLANS.
03:25:50.427: >> Councilmember Hayner:  IF WE BUILD PARK AND RIDE, WE CAN PUT IT AS A DONATION. SO WHO SHOULD BE PAYING FOR THEM, I GUESS. I GUESS I WOULD SAY BRIEFLY, THAT IN THE NON-MOTORIZED TRANSPORTATION PLAN, THIS JUST JAM. ED OUT BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO LIKE A 10-FOOT LANE HERE. IT'S VERY SPECIFIC IN THE PLAIN WHERE IT CALLS FOR 11-FOOT MOTOR VEHICLE LANES AND OPERATING SPEED AND TRAFFIC SHOULD BE LOOKED AT ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS. AND I PRESUME THAT'S HOW IT WAS FOLLOWED UP (THIS WAS LOOKED AT ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS BECAUSE THE LANE SIZE?
03:26:30.534: >> MM-HMM.
03:26:30.834: >> Councilmember Hayner:  AS FAR AS THE WBWC GOES, I KNOW ERICA IS HERE AND SOME OTHER FOLKS WHO ARE REPRESENTATIVES. MAYBE YOU CAN NOD FROM THE AUDIENCE, ARE YOU GUYS ENGAGING IN EDUCATION? DO ALL CYCLISTS KNOW THAT THE TIPS THE SHARROWS KNOW THAT'S WHERE YOU DRIVE, WOO PEDESTRIANS AND CYCLISTS. WE HAVE 500 EMAILS THAT I ASSUME ARE THE RESULT OF YOUR MAILING LIST. AND FORMER COUNCILMEMBER WESTPHAL IS STILL PUSHING PEOPLE TO WRITE US. AND SO, YOU KNOW -- I THINK, YOU KNOW, MR. WESTPHAL WAS STILL HERE, THE NEXT ONE AFTER EARHART WOULD BE HURON PARKWAY. THAT'S WHAT WE HEARD ANYWAY. AND SO LIKE, ARE YOU DOING EDUCATION? DO YOU MIND? WOULD COUNCIL'S DEFERENCE. I WANT TO KNOW IF WBWC IS DOING THE TYPE OF EDUCATION --
03:27:29.359: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  WE JUST SPENT ABOUT 20 MINUTES TALKING ABOUT THE NEIGHBORHOOD -- AND NOW WE WILL TALK ABOUT SOMETHING THAT HAS ONLY ADJACENT RELEVANCE.
03:27:39.169: >> Councilmember Hayner:  IT'S ADJACENT RELEVANCE THAT EDUCATION AND ENFORCEMENT ARE PART OF THE EASE OF THE TOTAL OVERLOOK OF THE PROGRAM THAT THE NON-MOTORIZED TRANSPORTATION PLAN INCLUDES. AND I WANT TO KNOW IF THESE FOLKS THAT ARE VIGOROUSLY ADVOCATING FOR THESE CHANGES TO OUR ROADWAY ARE DOING ANYTHING OF THEIR OWN ACCORD TO EDUCATE THEIR USERS OF THE SYSTEM. I BELIEVE THAT IS TOTALLY RELEVANT TO THIS CONVERSATION. BECAUSE IF WE'RE PUTTING IN PARKINGS AND SHARRWS AND ALL OTHER TYPES OF MOVEMENTS BUT THERE'S NO EDUCATION AND THIS PERSON IS IN THE BEST PLACE TO EDUCATE THESE PEOPLE, THEN THAT'S IMPORTANT TO ME. [ OVERLAPPING SPEAKERS ]
03:28:21.611: >> Mayor Taylor: I DON'T SEE THE RELEVANCE BUT I STRIVE TO BE FAIRLY FORGIVING OF THIS, MAYBE WE CAN TALK -- WE'LL KEEP THIS SHORTER WITH AN ANSWER RATHER THAN A CONVERSATION AT THE TABLE. MS. BRIGGS IF YOU ARE WILLING.
03:28:33.490: >> YES, I'M HAPPY TO. SO AS A GRASS ROOTS VOLUNTEER LED, NONPROFIT, WE HAVE FOCUSED PRIMARILY OUR EFFORTS ON ENCOURAGING STAFF TO THINK ABOUT WHERE THE SHARROWS ARE PLACED. I THINK STAFF WOULD BE AWARE THAT WE HAVE BEEN CONCERNED WITH THE PLACEMENT OF SH SHARROS AND SOMETIMES THEY WERE ON THE DOOR ZONE. WE WANT TO SNAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE PLACED APPROPRIATELY IN THE PAVEMENT AREA. AND WE THINK THE ORGANIZATION BEST PLACED AND BEST SERVED TO DO EDUCATION IN THIS COMMUNITY IS THE CITY.
03:29:13.630: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, YOU STILL HAVE THE FLOOR.
03:29:16.366: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WOULD JUST POINT OUT THAT, YOU KNOW, THAT THAT DESCRIPTION SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S DIRECT LOBBYING OF STAFF GOING ON, WHICH IS A BIT UNUSUAL. THANK YOU.
03:29:28.011: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
03:29:30.547: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WOULD SUPPORT A PROJECT RECONFIGURATION ON TRAVERWOOD THAT INCLUDED TWO BUFFERED BIKE LANES AS WELL AS THE TWO LANES OF TRAFFIC. I HAVE A VERY DIFFICULT TIME SUPPORTING ON-STREET PARKING. I KNOW THAT WE NEED THE PARKING AND I THINK WE SHOULD EXPLORE PARK AND RIDE LOTS AND MAYBE A CONTRIBUTION FROM THE D.D.A. AND THERE'S LAND IN THIS AREA TO DO THAT HOWEVER -- HOWEVER, I CAN'T TELL MY CONSTITUENTS THAT WERE PUTTING ON-STREET PARKING IN AS PART OF A ROAD DIET WHEN WE ARE REMOVING ON-STREET PARKING TO PUT BIKE LANES IN IN OTHER PLACES. IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM CONSISTENT TO ME. I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THIS AS A TWO LANE, TWO BUFFERED LIKE BANE PROJECT.
03:30:33.376: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
03:30:34.310: >> Councilmember Eaton: IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU REDUCE LANES TO NARROW TRAFFIC. A MEMBER OF THE TRANSPORTATION CAUCUS ADMITTED THAT THERE WAS NO DATA COLLECTED ON WHETHER ANYBODY IS SPEEDING ON THIS STREET. AND SO I'M NOT SURE THAT WE ARE TRYING TO RESOLVE A PROBLEM THAT WE KNOW EXISTS, OR WHETHER WE ARE JUST RANDOMLY DESIGNING STREETS. SIMILAR TO OTHER COUNCILMEMBERS, I'M PARTICULARLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE ON-STREET PARKING. AND SO I WILL BE VOTING AGAINST THIS.
03:31:03.740: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
03:31:04.641: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I'M SUPPORTIVE OF THIS. I THINK TO HIT SOME IMPORTANT THINGS, IN ORDER GENERALLY, MY SENTIMENTS FROM THE LAST ITEM ARE REPLICATED HERE. THIS MAKES THE SITUATION SAFER. WE ARE ALREADY DOING THE RESURFACING. LET'S MAKE ANN ARBOR SAFER WHILE WE ARE INVESTING IN INFRASTRUCTURE. WE WOULD BE INVESTING IN OTHERWISE. WITH RESPECT TO NARROW LANES AND THE MOTIVE, YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE X AMOUNT OF PUBLIC RIGHTs WAY. IF YOU WANT TO SERVE DIFFERENT TYPES OF USERS FROM THE DRIVER TO THE CYCLIST TO THE PEDESTRIAN, YOU ARE GOING TO -- YOU ARE GOING TO DOLL THAT RIGHT-OF-WAY OUT IN DIFFERENT RATIOS. AND, YOU KNOW, IF YOU WANT TO ADD -- IF YOU WANT TO ADD BETTER BIKE FACILITIES AND YOU WANT TO ADD MORE PARKING, THAT'S GOING TO BE PART OF THE PROCESS. A NARROWER STREET CREATES A SLOWER EXPERIENCE FOR THE DRIVER. MAYBE WE DON'T HAVE SPEEDING RIGHT NOW. BUT THIS PREVENTS IT IN THE FUTURE AND I'M FINE WITH THAT. WITH RESPECT TO THE ON-STREET PARKING, YOU KNOW, GENERALLY I WOULD RATHER SEE THAT RIGHT-OF-WAY USED FOR SOMETHING OTHER THAN TEMPORARY CAR STORAGE, BUT, YOU KNOW, THERE'S A RELIGIOUS INSTITUTION IN THE AREA. THERE'S A PUBLIC EDUCATIONAL CONSTITUTION IN THE AREA. BOTH OF THOSE FACILITIES DESERVE PARKING. PEOPLE DESERVE TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THEM AND I'M FINE WITH THAT. FINALLY I JUST CANNOT COMMENT ON THE LOBBYING STAFF REMARK. THIS ISN'T THE N.R.A. THESE ARE LOCAL RESIDENTS WHO ARE SPENDING THEIR TIME AFTER WORK TO ADVOCATE FOR A SAFER NASH. PLEASE REACH OUT TO STAFF. -- SAFER ANN ARBOR. PLEASE REACH OUT TO STAFF. PLEASE TELL THOSE NOT IN THE WBWC REACH OUT TO STAFF. THEY ACTIVELY SOLICIT IT IN THIS PROCESS AND LOBBYING IS NOTHING MORE THAN WRITING YOU KNOW MR. HELLS LIVES IN THE CITY, WRITING YOUR NEIGHBOR AND SAYING THIS COULD BE A SAFER DESIGN BY MOVING SOMETHING INCHES TO THE LEFT. THANK YOU FOR DOING THAT. I DON'T SEE THAT AS SINISTER. I SEE THAT AS HELPFUL.
03:33:32.188: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? I TOO WILL BE VOTING IN FAVOR OF THIS NOR MANY OF THE SAME REASONS AS I SAID STATED PREVIOUSLY IN THE OTHER MATTER. THIS IS A DESIGN WHICH HAS BEEN RATIFIED BY TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERS. WE HAVE ASKED FOR A -- YOU KNOW, THEIR -- THEM TO DEPLOY THE INGENUITY. IT'S COMPLIANT WITH THEIR PROFESSIONAL EXPERTISE AND GONE THROUGH THAT PRISM WITH RIGOR. SO TO ME, AGAIN, THE QUESTION IS VERY SIMPLE. WE HAVE ASKED STAFF TO MAKE THE ROADS SAFER. THEY BELIEVE THIS WILL ACHIEVE THAT END. LET'S GO FORWARD. FURTHER DISCUSSION. ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
03:34:36.085: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES.
03:34:36.686: >> Councilmember Grand: YES.
03:34:37.286: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES.
03:34:39.222: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
03:34:39.722: >> Councilmember Eaton: NO.
03:34:40.323: >> Councilmember Nelson:  YES.
03:34:42.592: >> Councilmember Smith: YES.
03:34:43.259: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES.
03:34:44.093: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES.
03:34:47.163: >> Councilmember Bannister: NO.
03:34:51.667: >> Councilmember Griswold: NO.
03:34:52.602: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION CARRIES.
03:34:55.138: >> Mayor Taylor: DC-3, RESOLUTION TO PROCEED WITH ROAD RECONFIGURATION PILOT FOR GREEN RHOAD FROM BURBANK DRIVE TO PLYMOUTH ROAD. DISCUSSION OF DS-3 AND PERHAPS WE CAN KEEP THIS QUICKER THAN THE LAST TWO. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER AND THEN LUMM.
03:35:11.988: >> Councilmember Hayner:  CITY COUNCILMEMBERS ARE DISCOURAGED AND PROHIBITED ELECTRIC DIRECTING STAFF AND DISCOURAGED FROM FRANKLY TALKING TO STAFF, AND SO WHEN I SUGGEST THAT A NONPROFIT WHO IS WORKING IN THE COMMUNITY TO BRING ABOUT CHANGES THAT THEY FEEL ARE BEST FOR THEIR MEMBERS THAT'S LOBBYING. THIS ISN'T ABOUT THE N.R.A. FOR GOODNESS SAKE. THE DEFINITION OF LOBBYING IS WORKING WITH A POLITICAL BODY, WOULDING -- IN THIS CASE WITH A STAFF, I'M TOLD TO AFFECT CHANGE, POLICY CHANGE THAT BENEFITS THE LOBBYISTS. I THINK IT'S OKAY TO POINT OUT THAT THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON HERE. IT'S NOT A NEGATIVE THING. THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON. THESE FOLKS BELIEVE STRONGLY IN THESE PRINCIPLES OF PEDESTRIAN AND BIKE SAFETY. I THINK IT'S -- I DIDN'T GET 200 EMAILS OR 400 EMAILS BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT MAKING AN EFFORT TO REACH OUT TO US. I DIDN'T SAY IT WAS A NEGATIVE THING. YOU KNOW, THE TENSION AT THIS TABLE IS UNBELIEVABLE. AND, YOU KNOW, THE FACT IS, A LOT OF IT IS BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, THE POLITICS ARE INTERTWINED AROUND THESE ISSUES AND PEOPLE RUSH TO JUDGMENT ON HOW WE ARE GOING TO VOTE ON SOMETHING. AND THEY MAKE THESE ASSUMPTIONS AND THEY TELL PEOPLE THIS PERSON IS DOING IT THAT WAY AND THAT WAY AND THEY THINK THEY KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON BACK HERE BEHIND THIS DAIS AND THEY DON'T.
03:36:57.693: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
03:36:58.928: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. THIS PROPOSED ROAD DIET FOR GREEN ROAD NORTH OF PLYMOUTH HAS TWO PIECES. IN THE SECTION NORTH OF COMMONWEALTH TO BURBANK, GREEN WILL BE REDUCED FROM FOUR VEHICLE TRAVEL LANES TWO NORTH AND TWO SOUTH, TO THREE VEHICLES ONE EACH NORTH AND SOUTH, AND A CENTER LEFT TURN LANE. IN THE SECTION FROM PLYMOUTH TO COMMONWEALTH, GREEN WILL BE REDUCED FROM FIVE VEHICLE LANE, TWO NORTH, TWO SOUTH AND CENTER LEFT TURN LANE TO FOUR VEHICLE LANES TWO SOUTH AND ONE NORTH AND CENTER LEFT TURN LANE. IN BOTH SECTIONS, BIKE LANES WILL BE ADDED ON BOTH SIDES OF THE STREET. THERE WERE NUMEROUS CHANGES PROPOSED HERE BUT THE TWO MOST SIGNIFICANT IN MY VIEW ARE THE GREEN NORTH OF PLYMOUTH WILL BE JUST ONE LANE HEADING NORTH AND THAT THE VEHICLE LANE WIDTHED ARE NARROWED. IF YOU USE THIS CORRIDOR, YOU KNOW THE GREEN PLYMOUTH INTERSECTION IS VERY, VERY, VERY BUSY. THE STAFF ANALYSIS OF A POTENTIAL ROAD DIET ACKNOWLEDGED THE HEAVY VOLUME AND THE ANALYSIS LISTED SEVERAL FACTORS THAT DISCOURAGE A ROAD DIET. SPECIFICALLY, THE CHALLENGES OR ADVERSE CHARACTERISTICS IDENTIFIED BY STAFF IN THE ANALYSIS THAT SUGGESTED A ROAD DIET WOULDN'T BE APPROPRIATE INCLUDED ONE GREEN PLYMOUTH IS A VERY BUSY INTERSECTION WITH MANY OFF-ON POINTS IN THE AREA IMMEDIATELY NORTH OF PLYMOUTH. TWO, THE 750, ARE IN THE RANGE WHERE ROAD DIETS ARE NOT CONSIDERED VIABLE. THREE, THE TRAFFIC COULD BE DIVERTED FROM GREEN TO NIXON, WHICH WE KNOW WOULD BE HIGHLY PROBLEMATIC AS NIXON ALREADY HAS MAJOR CONGESTION ISSUES. FOUR, THE ROAD DIET COUPLED WITH WITH THE HIGH BUS TRAFFIC AND MANY OFF-ON POINTS WOULD ADD TO DRIVER FRICTION AND DISCOMFORT. THE LAST ISSUE, DRIVER FRICTION AND DISCOMFORT. THEY KNOW IT CAN BE A CHALLENGE NOW WITH THE C.V.S. RESTAURANT, OTHER RAMPS AND TRUCK TRAFFIC. I WILL JUST SAY THAT I'M OUT THERE EVERY WEEK. I HAVE MY WARD 2 COFFEES AT THE PLUM MARKET AND OFTEN I CAN'T -- I CAN'T TURN ON TO THE LANE THAT ENTERS. I HAVE TO WAIT TO ACCESS THE SHOPPING MALL BECAUSE THE DELIVERY TRUCKS FOR C.V.S. PARK IN THAT LANE. AND THEY UNLOAD THEIR -- I MEAN THEIR PALLETS ARE IN THE DRIVEWAY. THEY UNLOAD THEIR PRODUCTS THERE AND WHAT THAT DOES TO GREEN, WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEONE LIKE ME WAITING TO TURN IN THERE, IT STOPS THE TRAFFIC. SO IMAGINE THAT WITH JUST ONE VEHICLE LANE NORTH AND A NARROWER LANE AND I BIKE LANE. HOW ANYONE CAN CONCLUDE THAT JUST FRICTION OR DISCOMFORT, END QUOTE, AND NOT A GENUINE SAFETY HAZARD IS BEYOND ME. REMEMBER, COMPOUNDING ALL OF THIS IS WITH ALL THE NEW DEVELOPMENT ONYXON AND NORTHEAST ANN ARBOR, THE TRAFFIC VOLUMES ARE ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE, AND WE WON'T KNOW THE FULL EXTENT OF THAT UNTIL THE DEVELOPMENTS ARE FULLY BILLED OUT. THE BIGGEST POSITIVE I SEE WITH THIS PROPOSAL IS THAT IT'S NOT AS BAD AS IT COULD HAVE BEEN. THE ORIGINAL PROPOSAL ALSO INCLUDED CHANGING THE SOUTHBOUND GREEN TO INTERSECTION BUT AFTER PUBLIC INPUT, THE ORIGINAL IS -- THERE'S ONE CENTER STREET LANE AND ONE RIGHT TURN LANE. THAT CONFIGURATION HAS WORKED VERY WELL AT THAT HIGH VOLUME INTERSECTION AND FORTUNATELY, IF THIS PASSES TONIGHT, THAT WON'T CHANGE. ALTHOUGH THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION COMMUNICATE THAT COUNCIL SUGGESTED PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR ALL THREE PROPOSALS THAT, WAS NOT ACCURATE IN THIS CASE. THERE WERE NOT A LARGE NUMBER OF SURVEY RESPONDENTS, BUT THE SURVEY FEEDBACK WAS DECIDEDLY NEGATIVE FOR THIS GREEN ROAD PROPOSAL. ONLY 40%, EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR THE FOUR TO THREE RAIN ROAD DIET AND LESS THAN 20% INDICATED THAT THEY SUPPORTED THE OPTION C PROPOSAL FOR THE GREEN PLYMOUTH INTERSECTION. I INVITE ALL OF YOU TO TRY AND NAVIGATE THIS AREA DURING PEAK TRAFFIC TIMES AND SEE IF YOU WOULD VOTE ANY DIFFERENTLY THAN THOSE FOLKS. I SUSPECT NOT. THE PUBLIC DOESN'T SUPPORT THIS. AND IN ITS ANALYSIS STAFF PROVIDED MORE THAN ENOUGH JUSTIFICATION FOR WHY A ROAD DIET JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. FOR ALL OF THESE REASONED, I WON'T BE SUPPORTING THIS SEASON AND I HOPE YOU WILL AGREE AND JOIN ME IN OPPOSING THIS SEASON. BUT IF IT DOES PASS IT'S IMPERATIVE THIS IS ACTUALLY TREATED AS THE QUOTE, PILOT IT'S LABELED WITH A THOROUGH DETAILED FOLLOW-UP ON ALL THE PERFORMANCE METRICKED. MS. REDDINGER HAD IDENTIFIED INCLUDING A ROBUST PUBLIC INVESTIGATION OF USERS. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR LISTENING.
03:42:21.650: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
03:42:23.419: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I -- COUNCILMEMBER LUMM MENTIONS A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT I WANTED TO MENTION BUT I'M LOOKING AT THEM DIFFERENTLY. I'M NOT OVERLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE DISCOMFORT OR FRICTION FELT BY THE DRIVERS BUT I DO APPRECIATE THAT STAFF REPORT MEANT -- STAFF'S REPORT MENTIONS A LOT OF FACTORS THAT I FIND VERY COMPELLING ARGUMENTS NOT TO PUT A BUFFERED BIKE LANE HERE. THE MULTIPLE BUS AND THE FREIGHT TRAFFIC. THIS IS -- I FIND THIS TO BE ABSOLUTELY TERRIFYING PLACE TO PUT A BUFFERED BIKE LANE AND MAKE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A SAFE PLACE FOR A BICYCLE TO SAIL THROUGH. IT'S A SITUATION WHERE I THINK WE NEED TO BE STRATEGIC ABOUT WHAT ARE THE THOROUGHFARES IN TOWN WHERE IT'S SAFE TO BIKE. AND WE ARE NOT GOING TO PUT BUFFERED BIKE LANES ON EVERY SINGLE STREET. THERE ARE SOME STREETS THAT I DON'T WANT TO BIKE ON. I DON'T WANT TO BIKE ON PLYMOUTH ROAD. MAYBE YOU COULD PUT A BUFFERED BIKE LANE ON IT, BUT I WOULD STILL NOT WANT TO BIKE ON PLYMOUTH ROAD IF I CAN AVOID IT, IF I CAN BE OFF THE ROAD. I DON'T SEE HOW I CAN SUPPORT THIS. I HAVE A LOT OF LOCAL RESIDENTS WHO DESCRIBED SOME OF THE THINGS THAT COUNCILMEMBER LUMM SUGGESTED ABOUT HOW TERRIFYING IT IS WITH ALL -- IT'S JUST A LOT OF CONGESTION. THIS IS JUST A REALLY NOT A GOOD IDEA. THANK YOU.
03:43:57.146: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD?
03:44:00.616: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES, THE READY DIETS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT -- THE ROAD DIETS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT IN ON GREEN ROAD TO DATE I THINK ARE VERY EFFECTIVE. I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS. ONE IS I GOT A CALL TODAY THAT THERE WAS A DISCUSSION OR A POSSIBILITY OF USING CEDAR BROOK AND CONNECTING IT TO WHATEVER THE STREET IS TO THE SOUTH TO ALLOW FOR MORE TRAFFIC THROUGH THAT NEIGHBORHOOD TO ALLEVIATE TRAFFIC ON GREEN ROAD AND ARE WE LOOKING AT DIVERTING TRAFFIC TO NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS IN THAT AREA?
03:44:43.859: >> NOT THAT I'M AWARE OF.
03:44:44.927: >> Councilmember Griswold: OH, OKAY.
03:44:45.995: >> I WOULD BE HAPPY IF YOU WOULD FORWARD ALONG THAT PERSON'S CONTACT INFORMATION, HE CAN FOLLOW UP WITH THEM.
03:44:53.102: >> Councilmember Griswold: THAT WOULD BE GREAT. AND THEN THERE'S ALSO A NO TRUCK SIGN, JUST TO THE NORTH OF PLYMOUTH AND I THINK THE NUMBER IS -- THE TRAFFIC CONTROL NUMBER IS 102318, BUT I'M WONDERING IF THAT NO TRUCK SIGN WAS JUST PUT UP FOR THE CONSTRUCTION SEASON OR IF THAT IS A PERMANENT NO TRUCK SIGN. I KNOW.
03:45:27.336: >> WE CAN LOOK INTO THAT. I DID LOOK AT THE DESIGNATED TRUCK ROUTES AND GREEN IS NOT A DESIGNATED TRUCK ROUTE. SO WHAT THE GENESIS OF WHY THAT SIGN WAS PUT UP, I WOULD HAVE TO RESEARCH WHAT THE TRAFFIC CONTROL ORDER WAS ABOUT. WE DON'T HAVE THOSE COMMITTED TO MEMORY.
03:45:44.019: >> Councilmember Griswold: I'M VERY CONCERNED BECAUSE GREEN ROAD IS USED TO GET TO THE POSTAL SERVICE. YOU KNOW, TO THE POST OFFICE, THAT'S THERE AND THEY HAVE SEMI TRUCKS COMING AND GOING. AND THE SEMI TRUCKS THAT ARE GOING TO THE PLUM MARKET TO CVS AND FOR THE WHOLE COMMERCIAL AREA, IF THEY ARE COMING FROM THE WEST, IF THEY DON'T TURN AT THAT SIGNALIZED INTERSECTION, THEN THEY HAVE TO GO UP AND TURN INTO PLUCK MARKET AND WHEN THEY DO THAT, THEY ARE CROSSING LANES -- YOU KNOW, TWO LANES OF TRAFFIC THAT ARE TRAVELING AT A HIGH SPEED SOMETIMES. YOU HAVE THE FREEWAY TRAFFIC MAKING A RIGHT-HAND TURN AND I KNOW THAT SOME OF THE TRUCKS ARE OBEYING THE NO TRUCK SIGN AND THAT MEANS THEY ARE TURNING AT PLUM MARKET AND THAT SEEMS ILLOGICAL THAT WE WOULD EXPECT SEMI TRUCKS TO NOT USE A SIGNALIZED INTERSECTION.
03:46:40.476: >> WELL, I SPOKE TO NICK HUTCHINSON ABOUT TRUCK ROUTES. SO A TRUCK ROUTE IS NOT AN OUTRIGHT BAN FOR TRUCKS TO NOT USE ROADS THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED TRUCK ROUTES, RIGHT? IF THAT WERE THE CASE, YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO MOVE ANYBODY IN AND OUT OF THEIR HOUSE, RIGHT? BECAUSE A SEMI --
03:46:56.391: >> Councilmember Griswold: WHY DO WE HAVE A NO TRUCK SIGN THERE?
03:46:59.528: >> SO TRUCKS CAN STILL ACCESS, AS I UNDERSTAND LOCAL DESTINATIONS AND LOCAL BEIGES AND LOCAL DESIGNATIONS. THEY ARE MORE ABOUT THE ROADS THAT ARE MEANT TO ALLOW HEAVY TRUCKS TO TRAVERSE THE CITY AND GET THROUGH THE CITY. IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT IF THEY ARE -- LIKE THE POST OFFICE IS A GOOD EXAMPLE. WE POINT PROHIBIT POSTAL VEHICLES FROM GETTING TO THE POST OFFICE.
03:47:26.522: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I DON'T WANT TO BELABOR THIS, BUT I DON'T THINK PEOPLE -- TRUCK DRIVERS KNOW THAT A NO TRUCK SIGN MEANS IT'S OKAY TO DRIVE DOWN STREET AND THAT'S WHY I SAW THAT SEMI TRUCK TURNING AT THE NON-SIGNALIZED INTERSECTION. SO IF YOU COULD DEFINITELY LOOK AT WHY WE HAVE A NO TRUCK SIGN THERE, THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL.
03:47:49.912: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
03:47:52.815: >> Councilmember Lumm: JUST A QUICK FOLLOW ON ABOUT THE TRUCK SIGN AND THE KIND OF TRUCKS. I'M THINKING OUT LOUD. SO THERE ARE A LOT OF DOUBLE BARREL CONSTRUCTION VEHICLE TRUCKS THERE AND MR. HESS, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU ARE AWARE, BUT I ACTUALLY THINK THAT THIS CAME ABOUT BECAUSE -- WERE HE REPAVED GREEN ROAD LAST YEAR AND PEOPLE WERE VERY UPSET BECAUSE WE HAVE THESE DEVELOPMENTS THAT ARE BEING CONSTRUCTED AND NOW ALL OF THESE TRUCKS ARE USING CONSTRUCTION VEHICLE TRUCKS AND USING GREEN ROAD. AND THAT WAS PRESUMABLY A DESIGNATED NO TRUCK ROUTE FOR THOSE KINDS OF VEHICLES BECAUSE BETWEEN -- AS IS THAT STRETCH OF HURON, BETWEEN NIXON AND PLYMOUTH. THEY ARE NOT TRUCK ROUTES. THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BASICALLY -- THE CONSTRUCTION VEHICLES ARE SUPPOSED TO STICK TO NIXON ROAD. SORT OF A QUESTION, BUT I WAS AWARE OF THESE CONVERSATIONS. BECAUSE CLEARLY, WITH PLUM MARKET -- I MEAN, I'M THERE FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS EVERY MORNING AND THERE ARE A LOT OF SEMI TRUCKS COMING INTO THAT LITTLE STRIP MALL THERE FOR PLUM MARK ELIMINATE AND CVS. THE HOTEL, NOT SO MUCH. BUT THESE OTHER TWO BUSINESSES THERE'S A LOT OF THAT AND OBVIOUSLY, THEY ARE GOING TO BE -- AND THEY DO COME IN AND OFF OF GREEN ROAD.
03:49:26.341: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCICOUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
03:49:30.646: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES, I THINK SOME OF THE FRICTION THAT'S EXISTING TONIGHT NOT ON THE ROADWAY, BUT ACTUALLY AT COUNCIL IS IT'S BECAUSE THE COUNCIL MAJORITY CHANGED AND SO SOME OF THESE PROJECTS DIRECTION WAS GIVEN PRIOR TO THE NEW COUNCIL. AND SO I'M JUST ACKNOWLEDGING THAT. I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE ROAD DIET CONTINUE DOWN GREEN ROAD, BUT I'M TROUBLED BY THE INFORMATION THAT'S BEING PRESENTED AND DEFINITELY I WOULD NOT WANT IT AT THE FIRST BLOCK NORTHBOUND ON GREEN ROAD. AND MAYBE IT ISN'T. I DON'T KNOW. DOES THE ROAD DIET AND THE BUFFERED BIKE LANE GO ALL THE WAY WHEN YOU ARE NORTHBOUND ON --
03:50:14.890: >> YES.
03:50:15.424: >> Councilmember Griswold: OKAY.
03:50:16.558: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? [ OFF MICROPHONE COMMENT ]
03:50:25.267: >> Mayor Taylor: ROLL CALL VOLT, PLEASE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
03:50:34.343: >> Councilmember Lumm: NO.

03:50:56.898: >> Mayor Taylor: DS-4 RESOLUTION TO APPROVE FAIRVIEW CEMETERY RULES AND REGULATIONS. MOVED AND SECONDED. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
03:51:07.275: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU, MAYOR. I CIRCULATED AN AMENDMENT TO THIS RULES LIST THAT STANDS BEFORE US FOR APPROVAL. FUEL RULE NUMBER NINE, WHICH BAD PETS, I HAVE SUGGESTED WE CHANGE -- SHOULD I -- I DON'T KNOW IF THE FORMAL PROCESS IS. SHOULD I GO AHEAD AND READ IT? TO STRIKE 9 AND CHANGE IT TO SAY, ALL PETS MUST BE ON A LEASH, AND REMAIN ON THE PATHS OR ROADWAYS, PERIOD. WE'RE TRYING TO STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN LETTING THE NEIGHBORS USE AN ENJOY THE PARK -- THE PARK, AND, YOU KNOW, TAKE SOME RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR ANIMALS, WHICH I BELIEVE THEY DO. NOW, I KNOW THAT -- AND I SPOKE WITH OUR CLERK ABOUT IT, AND HAVING BEEN A DIRECT NEIGHBOR OF THIS FOR SEVERAL YEARS, -- I LOVED AT 1318 WRIGHT STREET. OUR CATS RAN WILD IN THERE. AND TO THE TRUTH IS, MAYBE MY CATS WERE IN THERE DOING THEIR BUSINESS. I WILL BE HONEST. WE HAD A CAT THAT KEPT GOING OUT, OR WHATEVER. BUT, YOU KNOW, I KNOW THAT THAT HAS EVOLVED. THE NEIGHBORHOOD HAS EVOLVED AND IT'S GREAT LITTLE NEIGHBORHOOD AND THESE FOLKS CAME UP HERE AND SORT OF PLEDGED RESPONSIBILITY AND WE KNOW WE HAVEN'T SEEN IT AND REALLY WHAT WE ARE SEEING IS A COUPLE OF BAD ACTORS LIKE DOG WALKERS BECAUSE THE FENCES. AND SO THEY THINK IT'S SAFE TO LET MY DOG RUN BECAUSE IT'S FENCED IN LIKE A DOG PARK WOULD BE. BUT, YOU KNOW, THERE'S A LOT OF DISSATISFACTION, BUT THERE'S DISSATISFACTION IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD WITH THE CONSTANT STATE OF THE BROADWAY DOG PARK, WHICH, YOU KNOW, IS STILL A NICE AMENITY FOR DOG OWNERS BUT ISN'T GREAT. AND SO I JUST THINK THIS IS A DECENT SOLUTION AND IT'S ALWAYS SOMETHING WE CAN COME BACK IN THERE CONTINUES TO BE COMPLAINTS ABOUT PEOPLE ABUSING THEIR PRIVILEGES THAT WE ALLOW THEM AND CHANGE THAT TO COMPLETELY BAN PETS, BUT I WOULD ASK MY COLLEAGUES TO INDULGE THE NEIGHBORHOOD'S REQUESTS THAT WE ALLOW RESTRICTED PET USE IN THIS PARK.
03:53:12.067: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE A SECOND ON THAT? THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER. IS THAT FRIENDLY TO THE BODY? FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE PAIN MOTION AS AMENDED. -- MAIN MOTION AS AMENDED. COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
03:53:23.745: >> Councilmember Bannister: WELL, I THERE SOME QUESTIONS QUESTIONS FORSTAFF BUT THEY ALLE JUST GONE HOME. I APOLOGIZE SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS DIDN'T MAKE IT INTO THE AGENDA QUESTIONS BUT THIS HAS BEEN EVOLVING WITH THE NEIGHBORHOOD JUST IN THE LAST DAY OR TWO. ONE OF THE QUESTIONS WAS THAT IT WAS TRANSFERRED OUT OF BEING A PARK DISTRICT IN 2017, AND SO WE WERE SORT OF WONDERING WHY IT WAS -- WHY THAT HAPPENED TO IT. WELL, WE --
03:53:59.247: >> I CAN ANSWER.
03:54:01.917: >> Councilmember Bannister: OKAY.
03:54:02.684: >> IT WASN'T  A PARK IN 2017. IT WAS MANAGED BY PUBLIC WORKS. IT WAS GIVEN TO PUBLIC WORKS BECAUSE THE LAWN MAINTENANCE AND THE SEXTON DUTIES AND THEN THEY ASKED CITY CLERK TO TAKE OVER BECAUSE OF THE RECORD KEEPING OF THE DECEASED.
03:54:28.877: >> Councilmember Bannister: OKAY. UNDER PUBLIC WORKS, WOULD IT -- UNDER PUBLIC WORKS, WOULD IT HAVE -- WOULD IT FALL UNDER PARK RULES THEN FOR DOGS ON LEASH?
03:54:41.590: >> I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT.
03:54:45.961: >> Councilmember Bannister: WE DON'T KNOW THAT. OKAY. DO WE KNOW IF THERE WERE ANY POLICE COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE PETS IN THE CEMETERY OR DID ALL OF THESE ISSUES COME FROM THIS ONE LAWN BO MOWING CONTRACTOR?
03:55:02.244: >> THE CONTRACTOR, JUST TO CLARIFY AND I THINK RESPONDED TO THE COUNCIL INQUIRY, HE'S ON CONTRACT TO MAINTAIN THE CEMETERY AND THAT INCLUDES THE INTERNMENTS AND DISINTERNMENTS, IT'S NOT JUST A LAWN MOWING CONTRACT. HE DOES HAVE TRADITIONAL SEXTON DUTIES IN TERMS OF MAINTAINING THE CEMETERY. BUT HE HAS COMPLAINED TO US ABOUT THE DOG WASTE IN THE CEMETERY AND ON THE GRAVES AND WE HAVE HAD SOME COMPLAINTS FROM PEOPLE VISITING THE CEMETERY. I CAN'T ANSWER AS TO WHETHER THE POLICE HAVE RECEIVED COMPLAINTED.
03:55:39.547: >> Councilmember Bannister: ACTUALLY SOME COMPLAINTS FROM SOME YOU ARE SAYING, NOT POLICE COMPLAINTS BUT --
03:55:49.257: >> I CAN'T ANSWER FOR THE POLICE DEPARTMENT, BUT THEY HAVE CONTACTED THE OFFICE INCLUDING THE CONTRACTED SEXTON.
03:56:00.101: >> Councilmember Bannister: THE ISSUE IS MAINLY COMING FROM THIS CONTRACTOR IS WHAT I'M GETTING. SO THAT'S CURIOUS IF YOU HAD ANY OTHER COMPLAINTS. SO THE CONTRACTOR HAS HAD THE JOB FOR MANY, MANY YEARS. AND DO WE COMPETITIVELY BID OUT?
03:56:20.855: >> Clerk Beaudry: YES, WE PUT OUT A CEMETERY MAINTENANCE AND SEXANT SERVICES. IT WAS THROUGH CITY PURCHASING PUT OUT ON OUR STANDARD RFP PROCESS.
03:56:35.136: >> Councilmember Bannister: OKAY. BECAUSE I AM HEARING THROUGH THIS PROCESS, I AM HEARING A LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT HIS O HIS BEH, INTIMIDATING, CHASING PEOPLE, YELLING AT THEM, A LOT OF PROBLEMS COMING FROM HIM. AND AS FAR AS WASTE -- WASTE IN THE YARD I THINK THAT'S COMPELLING THAT THE FOX, THE RACCOON, THE DEER, THE RABBITS, IT'S HARD TO TRACE IT TO THE DOGS. ONE OF THE THINGS ABOUT THE BID TOO IS THAT THE PARK -- IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN, THE PARKS WILL MOW FOR $30 AN ACRE, AND THIS PARTICULAR CONTRACT, IF HE MOWS 16 TIMES A YEAR, IT'S $125 PER ACRE. WHICH WOULD BE MUCH -- FAR MORE EXPENSIVE.
03:57:41.369: >> Clerk Beaudry: WE ANSWERED THAT IN THE COUNCIL REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. HE'S NOT BILLING ON A PER ACRE. HE HAS A CONTRACT FOR A SET MAINTENANCE AMOUNT PER MONTH. AND THAT INCLUDES OTHER DUTIES BESIDES LAWN MOWING AND I THINK THERE'S SOME CONFUSION ABOUT HIS TOTAL CONTRACT THAT ALSO INCLUDES A PASS THROUGH FOR FUNERAL SERVICES THAT WE PAY HIM AND THEN THE FAMILY OF THE DECEASED PAYS US. SO SOME OF THE MONEY HE'S EARNED IS NOT JUST FOR THE MAINTENANCE CONTRACT. AND I PUT THAT IN THE R.F.I. RESPONSE.
03:58:14.769: >> Councilmember Bannister: OKAY. AND WE'RE EXISTING MAYBE LESS THAN THREE BURIALS A YEAR GOING INTO CEMETERY CURRENTLY? DO WE HAVE A -- CL
03:58:29.451: >> Clerk Beaudry: I'M NOT SURE WHERE THAT ESTIMATE CAME IN?
03:58:31.453: >> Councilmember Bannister: JUST THE NEIGHBORS OBSERVING.
03:58:34.022: >> Clerk Beaudry: I CAN GET BACK TO YOU ON THE EXACT NUMBER OF BURIALS.
03:58:37.425: >> Councilmember Bannister: OKAY. WELL, I GUESS -- THOSE WERE JUST SOME OF MY QUESTIONS. I THINK WHAT -- AS WE HAVE SEEN FROM THE PUBLIC COMMENTS AT THE LAST TWO MEETING AND WHAT WE HAVE HEARD FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD, THERE'S A SMALL GROUP OF -- WE HAVE GOTTEN A COUPLE OF EMAILS FROM PEOPLE WHO REALLY WOULD LIKE FOR THERE NOT TO BE DOGS IN THERE, BUT AS WE ARE HEARING FROM THE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY LIVE THERE AND WALK THERE, IT IS A MAJOR ADVANTAGE TO THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD TO HAVE DOG WALKERS 24 HOURS A DAY IN THE CEMETERY BECAUSE THEY ARE HELPING KEEP IT FREE FROM DRUGS AND VANDALISM AND ALL OF THOSE KIND OF ISSUES. SO BY HAVING PEOPLE WALKING THEIR DOG AT 5 A.M. AND 1 A.M. AND 24 HOURS A DAY, THAT THAT IS A QUALITY OF LIFE FOR THE NEIGHBORHOOD. SO I AM HOPING THAT YOU ALL WILL HEAR WHAT THE NEIGHBORS HAVE SAID AND REALIZE THAT THEY DO -- THIS IS A VERY VALUABLE PLACE FOR THEM TO BUILD COMMUNITY, SEE EACH OTHER, TALK AND KEEP THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD SAFE. SO I HOPE YOU WILL ALLOW THEM TO CONTINUE AS IT'S BEEN FOR DECADES.
04:00:17.959: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
04:00:18.826: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANKS. I WILL BE BRIEF. I KNOW IT'S AN ODD BALL THING THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HERE AND I WANT TO RESPECT AND ACKNOWLEDGE THE RESIDENTS' CONCERNS HERE WHO FEEL THAT THIS -- BECAUSE IT IS A CEMETERY. IT ISN'T A PARK. THAT THIS ISN'T THE RIGHT SOLUTION. SO WHAT WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US HERE IS A SITUATION WHERE IF WE SAY, THERE'S NO DOGS. YOU CA CAN'T HAVE DOGS. THE RESPECTFUL PEOPLE WILL WALK THEIR DOGS IN RESPECTFUL MANNER. AND THE PEOPLE WHO BREAK THE LAW WILL CONTINUE TO BREAK THE LAW AND NOT CLEAN UP AFTER THEMSELVES. I GUESS THE IDEA OF ME PUTTING THE RESOLUTION IN THERE -- THE IDEA OF THIS AMENDMENT TO TO THIS AND TO IT WHOLLY IS THAT -- AND OBVIOUSLY I DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEMS WITH ANYTHING NECESSARY THERE. I THANK THE CLERK FOR HER FINE WORK. IT'S -- IT'S HOW ARE WE GOING TO REGULATE THE PROBLEM BEHAVIOR IN THIS AREA? BANNING DOGS IS NOT GOING TO KEEP THESE PEOPLE FROM RUNNING THEIR DOGS IN THE PARK. WE KNOW THE NEIGHBORS SAID THEY DO IT. IT'S A COUPLE PROBLEM PEOPLE. DO WE SAY NO DOGS, NO PETS AND IMPOSE AN EXTRAORDINARY STIFF FINE AND THE POLICE KEEP TRYING TO COME OUT? I MEAN, AS AN EAGLE SCOUT, I KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A RABBIT AND A DEER AND A DOG AND A CAT AND A -- I MEAN, YOU DO. EITHER YOU DO OR YOU DON'T. HE WITH KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON THEREA. AND I WOULD LOVE TO STOP IT AND I JUST -- I DON'T WANT ANYBODY TO THINK THAT WE ARE BEING DISRESPECTFUL EVER WHAT SOME CONSIDER A SACRED PLACE BY LETTING DOGS GO FROM IN THERE BUT THEY DO NOW. AND SO THAT'S KIND OF WHERE I'M COMING FROM ON THIS. I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN GET THIS NEIGHBORHOOD WILL KIND OF STEP UP. AND IF THEY SEE THE GUY RUNNING -- THEY SEE WHOEVER IT IS RUNNING THEIR DOGS IN THERE, CALL THE POLICE, PLEASE! BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT'S DISRESPECTFUL OF IT. SO I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT. IT'S STUFF WHEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES THE ISSUES REACHING OUT TO YOU AND SO I WANTED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. I RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS VERY MEANINGFUL TO SOME PEOPLE THEY DON'T LIKE THE IDEA OF FOUR-FOOTED CREATURES IN THERE DOING THEIR THING. BUT I'M HOPING THAT 'EM POWERIN- EMPOWERING THE NEIGHBORHOOD WILL SOLVE THIS FOR US ONCE AND FOR ALL THANK YOU.
04:02:43.504: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
04:02:45.973: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I'M SORRY. I NEED TO ASK WHETHER WE ARE DISCUSSING THE AMENDMENT OR THE MOTION.
04:02:51.512: >> Mayor Taylor: THE AMENDMENT WAS FRIENDLY. IT'S THE MAIN MOTION AS AMENDED.
04:02:54.849: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I JUST HAVE A QUESTION ON THE CONTRACTOR. WHEN THEY LAST SIGNED THEIR CONTRACT -- WHEN WAS THE CONTRACT SIGNED? AND PERHAPS AT THAT TIME, WHY DIDN'T THE CONTRACTOR ASK FOR THE CHANGE AT THE TIME THAT THE CONTRACT WAS SIGNED? HE KNEW WHAT THE TERMS WERE AND HAD BEEN WORKING THERE FOR MANY YEARS. I'M JUST CURIOUS HE SIGNED THE CONTRACT UNDER THE PREMISE THAT IT WAS UNDER AT THAT TIME. AND.
04:03:37.125: >> THE CONTRACT, I BELIEVE, WAS RENEWED IN 2018. WE TOOK OVER THE CEMETERY IN 2017 IN THE CLERK'S OFFICE. AND THE ENTIRE TIME WE HAVE HAD THE CEMETERY, HE'S BEEN ASKING FOR THE RULE UPDATE.
04:03:50.471: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  AND THE CONTRACT IS AN ANNUAL --
04:03:54.275: >> Clerk Beaudry: IT'S NOT IN HIS CONTRACT. IT'S COUNCIL'S PREROGATIVE TO PASS THE RULES AND REGULATIONS. YES, HE HAS SINCE -- SINCE THE CLERK'S OFFICE HAS BEEN INVOLVED. HE HAS SUGGESTED THAT THE BEST PRACTICE IS NO PETS.
04:04:06.487: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  AND THE CONTRACT IS UP FOR RENEWAL IN -- WHEN IS THE CONTRACT UP FOR RENEWAL AGAIN?
04:04:15.396: >> CLERK I SENT COPIES OF IT IN THE REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. IF IT DIDN'T GO TO ALL OF COUNCIL, I CAN FORWARD THAT. I DON'T KNOW OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD BUT I CAN FORWARD YOU THE CONTRACT.
04:04:25.039: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU.
04:04:27.408: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
04:04:32.013: >> Councilmember Lumm: JUST A QUICK THANK YOU FOR CLERK BEAUDRY FOR DOING EXCELLENT BENCHMARK RESEARCH AND IT WAS HELPFUL AND INFORMATIVE AND I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU SAID, COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER. CEMETERIES ARE NOT PARKS AND -- BUT IT WAS A FAIR QUESTION TO ASK BUT, AGAIN, THANK YOU FOR YOUR EXCELLENT RESEARCH.
04:04:51.933: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE. STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
04:05:00.741: >> Councilmember Grand: IS THIS ON THE AMENDMENT?
04:05:04.345: >> Councilmember Lumm: NO, BECAUSE IT WAS FRIENDLY.

04:05:23.030: >> Mayor Taylor: OTHER COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE CITY ATTORNEY. WE HAVE BEFORE US THE CLERK ACERATE OF COMMUNICATIONS, PETITIONS AND REFERRALS. MAY I HAVE A MOTION TO APPROVE THE CLERK'S REPORT. MOVED BY LUMM AND SMITH. DISCUSSION OF THE CLERK'S REPORT. ALL IN FAVOR. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? THE CLERK'S REPORT IS APPROVED. WE NOW COME TO PUBLIC COMMENT GENERAL TIME. IT'S TIME FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO SPEAK TO THE COUNCIL ABOUT MALTERS OF MUNICIPAL INTEREST. ONE NEED NOT HAVE SIGNED UP IN ADVANCE. PERS HAVE THREE MINUTES IN WHICH SPEAK TO SPEAK. SO PLEASE PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE TIME CLOCK. AS A MATTER OF COURTESY WE MAY ONLY HAVE ONE PERSON SPEAKING AT A TIME. WE WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO PROVIDE IT TO YOU. IS THERE ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT?
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
04:08:29.850: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU S. THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT?
04:08:36.323: >> I'M THE DIRECTOR WITH THE WAWASHTENAW WALKING AND BIKING COALITION. I WANTED TO SPEAK A LITTLE BIT TO THE TENOR OF CONVERSATION AROUND THE WBWC AND CLARIFY SOME THINGS IN TERMS OF OUR COMMUNICATIONS. OUR INTENT WAS NOT IN ANY WAY TO CALL PEOPLE ANTISCIENCE. THAT WASN'T OUR INTENT IN ANY WAY AND OUR COMMUNICATIONS. REALLY, IT WAS TRYING TO POINT TO A METHOD THAT IS SCIENTIFICALLY PROVEN, BOTH AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL AND IN OUR COMMUNITY WITH PREVIOUS ONES AND WITH THE RESEARCH THAT WAS DONE BY STAFF ON THE ONES THAT YOU JUST VOTED ON. IT WAS JUST TO LAY THAT OUT AND SAY THAT HERE IS AN OPTION TO GO TOWARDS VISION ZERO THAT WE FIND SCIENTIFICALLY VALID. WE TRY TO EDUCATE PEOPLE IN TERMS OF WHAT COUNCIL IS DOING AND THE TASKS YOU ARE TAKING ON. WE TRY TO EDUCATE PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY ABOUT BICYCLE SAFETY, AND TRAFFIC SAFETY AND ALL OF THOSE THINGS THROUGH PROVIDING THEM INFORMATION ABOUT HOW THE SYSTEMS WORK AND HOW THE NETWORKS COME TOGETHER, AND WHATNOT, AND TRYING TO MAKE THEM AWARE OF THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING IN COUNCIL SO THAT THEY CAN COME HERE AS INFORMED AS POSSIBLE. I WOULD LIKE TO APOLOGIZE IF ANYONE FELT THAT WE WERE CALLING THEM ANTISCIENCE. THAT WAS NOT OUR INTENT AT ALL AND I HOPE THAT YOU ACCEPT MY APOLOGY. I HOPE THAT THE WBWC CAN WORK WI THE COMMUNITY AND WITH COUNCIL TOGETHER. THAT'S MY VISION IN TERMS OF COMMUNICATION INTERACTION, SHARING IDEAS AND WHATNOT. I HOPE THAT THE WAY THAT THINGS UNFOLDED TODAY DOESN'T PREVENT US FROM DOING THAT. THANK YOU.
04:10:36.777: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
04:10:42.917: >> HI, I'M ADAM FROM WARD 4. I WANTED TO MAKE A FEW COMMENTS. I WANTED TO GIVE A SHOUT OUT FOR NELSON FOR GOING OUT BIKING AT THOSE PLACES THAT WERE ON THE TABLE TODAY. I THINK THAT'S REALLY -- AND I WOULD LIKE TO TO SEE THE REPORTS ON TWITTER AND I THINK IT'S BENEFICIAL TO EVERYBODY BECAUSE I BIKE DOWNTOWN HAM EVERY DAY, BUT IT'S NICE TO HEAR ANOTHER PERSON'S PERSPECTIVE ON TWITTER ABOUT THAT, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU ARE VOTING ON. IT. AND THEN ALSO I WANTED TO MENTION ABOUT THE EXPERIMENTS WITH -- I WANT TO CONTRAST THAT WITH FAILURES LIKE COUNCILMEMBER GRAND WAS SAYING, I THINK THAT IT -- A FAILED EXPERIMENT AT A RELATIVELY LOW COST IS BETTER IN MY OPINION THAN GOING OUT AND IT'S HARD TO MAKE -- TAKE CHANCES ON EXPERIENCES IN A DELIBERATIVE BODY. WE HAVE A FEW PEOPLE WHO ARE MAKING THESE RISKY DECISIONS AND DECISIONSEASIER TO GO AT IT TOG. AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO TAKE MORE CHANCES ON THE EXPERIMENTS BECAUSE THEY ARE ESPECIALLY THE ONES THAT WERE ON THE TABLE TODAY HAD THE MEASURABLE -- WHEN YOU ARE -- WHEN WE ARE DONE, YOU CAN SEE THE METRICS AND SEE IF THEY ARE IMPROVING THE THINGS THAT THEY SAID THEY WOULD BE IMPROVING AND MAYBE WE CAN ADD TO THE METRICS TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE IS CONCERNED AS I HEARD IN THE FUTURE. AND THEN ALSO I WANTED TO MENTION THAT TRAFFIC POLICIES ARE NOT ALL ABOUT VISION ZERO. I DEFINITELY IN SUPPORT OF VISION ZERO, BUT I THINK THAT IMPROVING MULTI MODAL TRANSPORTATION AND ALTERNATIVE MODES OF TRANSPORTATION LIKE COUNCILMEMBER SMITH WAS MENTIONING. THE -- THE MONTH ARE INCLUSIVE METRICS THAT WE COULD BE USING IN TERMS OF THE TRAFFIC VOLUME THROUGH A ROAD WOULD BE REALLY GREAT TO SEE. I THINK JUST LOOKING AT VISION ZERO, WHEN YOU ARE LOOKING AT A ROAD QUI DIET OR SOMETHING, IT'S VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THERE ARE DEATHS AND ACCIDENTS OCCURRING. I THINK ON TOP OF THAT IMPROVING THE MULTIMODAL TRANSIT OPTIONS IS JUST AS IMPORTANT. SO WORTH DISCUSSING AS WELL. SO THANK YOU.
04:13:02.823: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
04:13:10.731: >> HI, MY NAME IS ED VILAMETTI. I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO AN ISSUE THAT CAME UP DURING THE FOIA DISCUSSION REGARDING PRIVACY. THERE WAS A CONCERN THAT MEMBERS THE PUBLIC, MEMBERS OF COUNCIL HAD SOME RIGHT TO PRIVACY WHEN THEY WERE COMMUNICATING WITH EACH OTHER AND THAT IT WOULD BE UNDULY BURDENSOME TO HAVE PRIVATE INFORMATION SHARED WIDELY. I WANT TO CONTRAST THAT WITH THE NEW CITY POLICY TOWARDS VISITORS TO CITY HALL. IT'S NOW NECESSARY IF YOU WANT TO VISIT CITY HALL AND VISIT ANYONE ABOVE THE SECOND FLOOR TO PROVIDE YOUR NAME PROVIDE AN IMAGE OF YOUR FACE AND TO -- THEY DON'T ASK FOR YOUR FINGERPRINT AS FAR AS I COULD TELL BUT, YOU KNOW, WITH MODERN FACIAL RECOGNITION SYSTEMS, A CLEAR SHOT OF YOUR FACE IS NOT THAT DIFFERENT FROM A FINGERPRINT BECAUSE THE TECHNOLOGY IS SUCH THAT A CLEAR PICTURE OF A FACE GETS INTERPRETED MANY THE SAME WAYS THAT A FINGERPRINT GETS TAKEN. AND SO IF I WANT TO GO TO THE ASSESSOR'S OFFICE, IF I WANT TO VISIT THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR, THERE'S A RECORD OF THAT. AND IT'S A DATABASE THAT IS -- WELL, I GUESS I DON'T KNOW. IS IT A DATABASE THAT'S BEING KEPT? IS THERE A RECORDS RETENTION POLICY FOR THIS? ARE THESE RECORDS SUBJECT TO FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT REQUESTS THEMSELVES? A WHOLE BUNCH OF POLICY QUESTIONS, AS OF YET UNDETERMINED AND, YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT COUNCIL SHOULD BE MINDFUL AND THE CITY STAFF SHOULD BE MINDFUL THAT, YOU KNOW, THERE'S SOME REAL QUESTIONS THAT WILL INEVITABLY COME UP. THE COMPARISON IS MADE WITH THE WHITE HOUSE VISITOR LOGS. OF COURSE THIS IS NOT THE WHITE HOUSE. OKAY. DIFFERENT LEVEL OF -- DIFFERENT LEVEL, RIGHT, BUT THE SAME KIND OF THING. AND, YOU KNOW, IF I WAS A CONTRACTOR BUILDING SOMETHING, I WOULD LOVE TO KNOW MY COMPETITORS' HABITS TOWARDS STAFF VISITS. SO, YOU KNOW, IT'S INTERESTING DATA. PICTURES OF CITIZENS OF ANN ARBOR, LET'S SEE IF THOSE GET REDACTED. THANKS.
04:16:02.736: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WOULD WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT -- WOULD WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT. ARE THERE COMMUNICATIONS FROM COUNCIL? COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD?
04:16:12.613: >> Councilmember Griswold:  WE HAVE HAD A LOT OF FOCUS ON PEDESTRIAN SAFETY RECENTLY, AND I HOPE WE CAN COME TOGETHER AND WORK ON IMPROVING OUR CRASH RATE BECAUSE IT HAS NOT BEEN DECLINING TO DATE. I WOULD LIKE TO EXPLAIN AND STATE AGAIN THAT I AM NOT IN VIOLATION OF FOIA. THAT I HAVE ASKED FOR CLARIFICATION REGARDING FOIA. SO THE FACT THAT PEOPLE KEEP SAYING I'M IN VIOLATION, I WILL ASK THE CITY ATTORNEY TO INFORM ME IN WRITING WHEN I AM IN VIOLATION SO I CAN LET PEOPLE KNOW. I AM A MEMBER OF THE WBWC AND HAVE BEEN FOR A LONG TIME. THE CONFUSION IS THAT WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT SCIENTIFICALLY-BASED ROAD DIETS. THAT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE. THESE THREE ROAD CONFIGURATIONS WERE NOT TRADITIONAL ROAD DIETS. SO YOU CAN'T MAKE THAT ASSUMPTION. OTHERWISE, I HOPE THAT WE CAN HAVE A LITTLE BETTER CIVILITY AT THE COUNCIL TABLE. TOMORROW GO BE OUR PRIMARY ELECTION DAY IF WE HAD TWO-YEAR TERMS. WE NOW HAVE FOUR-YEAR TERMS. WE HAVE ANOTHER YEAR BEFORE THE ELECTION. AND SO I HOPE THAT WE CAN FOCUS ON MAKING SOME IMPROVEMENTS, ESPECIALLY TO STREET LIGHTS AT CROSSWALKS BETWEEN NOW AND THE NEXT FEW MONTHS BEFORE WE GET INTO THE POLITICAL SEASON. BYE.
04:17:51.612: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCIL GRISWOLD, RAM -- SORRY, HAYNER, RAMLAWI AND BANNISTER.
04:17:57.584: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WANT TO SHARE MR. VALIAMETTI'S CONCERNS. I DON'T RECALL SEEING ANYTHING THAT PEOPLE WERE GOING TO BE PHOTOGRAPHED COMING IN HERE AS PART OF THE SYSTEM. IT'S SHOCKING TO ME TO HEAR THAT. AS A PERSON WHO IS INTERESTED IN THESE KINDS OF THINGS, I SHARE YOUR I.T. CURIOSITIES ABOUT THESE THINGS. I WILL ASK OUR CITY ADMINISTRATOR IF YOU COULD MAYBE NEXT WEEK OR SOMETIME WHEN YOU GET AN OPPORTUNITY GIVE ME A SUM SUMMARY OF WHAT IS GOING ON DOWN THERE. WITH VISITOR RECORDS BEING SUBJECTED TO FOIA. WE THOUGHT IT WAS A GUY SITTING AT A DESK WITH BADGE ACCESS. I THOUGHT THEY WERE GIVING THEM A BADGE. THANK YOU, CITIZEN, FOR BRINGING THAT FORWARD, AND I -- IF THIS IS A POLICY ISSUE, I THINK WE SHOULD MAYBE ADDRESS THIS AND MAKE SURE THAT WE DO HAVE THE POLICIES IN PLACE TO SCRUB THOSE RECORDS. I DON'T THINK ANYBODY NEEDS TO KNOW WHO COMES IN AND OUT OF CITY HALL. I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE A RECORD RETENTION AND THEN WE SHOULD HAVE SOME TYPE OF RETENTION, YOU KNOW IF THERE HASN'T BEEN ANY TROUBLE, GET RID OF THEM. FLUSH THEM OUT. I WANT TO WORK WITH WHOEVER IS NECESSARY ON THAT TO MAKE SURE THAT CITIZENS MAINTAIN THEIR ANONYMITY WHEN THEY COME HERE TO DO CITY BUSINESS.
04:19:19.933: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
04:19:20.967: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, MAYOR. I WANTED TO BRING TO COUNCIL'S ATTENTION THAT I WILL BE BRINGING A RESOLUTION, REGARDING 415 WEST WASHINGTON. HOPEFULLY ON THE NEXT AGENDA, WHERE WE ARE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT IT, THE SAME WAY THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT THE Y LOT WITH A LOT OF PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT TO BEGIN WITH BEFORE WE DECIDE WHAT WE WANT TO DO WITH IT, IF ANYTHING. BUT BEING IN THE 5th WARD, IT'S A GOAL OF MINE TO HAVE SOMETHING DONE WITH THAT BEFORE I LEAVE THIS TABLE. AND I PRESSED HARD AND IT FINALLY GOT SOME RESULTS. THE D.A.A. HAS AGREED TO PAY FOR THIS, AS FAR AS I KNOW, UNLESS THAT HAS BEEN CHANGED OUT ABOUTE D.D.A. HAS WILL BE PUTTING UP THE MONEY. I WILL FOUGHT HARD FOR THAT. IT FALLS WITHIN THEIR BOUNDARIES AND IT WAS ONLY -- IT ONLY MADE SENSE TO ME THAT -- THAT THAT'S THE ENTITY THAT HELPS TO TAKE THE LEAD ON THIS. THAT'S WHY IT WAS CREATED. THEY COLLECT MONEY IN THAT AREA. AND IT ONLY MAKES SENSE THAT FOR THEM TO BE A PARTNER THIS THIS AND THEY WERE ALL GENEROUS ENOUGH TO BRING $75,000 TO THE PROCESS. SO LOOK FOR THAT. AND WELCOME ANY INPUT ON THAT, BUT IT'S A BIG CONCERN OF MINE. IT'S A CONCERN OF THE RESIDENTS IN THE FOURTH WARD AND DOWNTOWN. IT'S TURNED INTO AN EYE SORE THAT GETS FORGOTTEN ABOUT. SO THAT AS WELL AS, YOU KNOW, I AGREE WITH KAI, WITH THOSE FOIA RELEASES. WE DID GET SOME LETTERS FROM KIDS AND THAT'S BEEN PROBABLY THE BEST PART OF BEING ON COUNCIL SO FAR, IS GOING TO THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS AND GETTING THOSE LETTERS. THE MINDS THAT ARE THERE AND WHAT THEY ARE INTERESTED IN, JUST MAKE YOU FEEL A LOT BETTER THAN SOME OF THE OTHER EMAILS AND LETTERS YOU READ. SO, YOU KNOW, IT'S ALWAYS A TREAT TO GO TO THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS, UNIT, JR. JUNIOR HIGH I HAVEN'T BEEN TO, BUT THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS IT'S GOOD FOR THE SOUL. I WOULD PROBABLY SUGGEST THAT FOR MANY MEMBERS ON COUNCIL, WHEN THEY FEEL LIKE THEY NEED TO REPLENISH THEMSELVES. SO I WILL LEAVE IT AT THAT. IT'S A LATE NIGHT. WE WILL THOUGHT WE WOULD BE OUT OF HERE EARLIER BUT I JUST NEEDED TO INFORM COUNCIL OF MY INTENTION ON 415. THANK YOU.
04:22:08.501: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
04:22:09.569: >> Councilmember Bannister: FOR THE RECORD, I DID WANT TO SAY THAT TO MY KNOWLEDGE, I HAVE NOT BEEN INFORMED THAT I'M OUT OF COMPLIANCE ON A FOIA REQUEST EITHER. I DO SERVE ON THE RULES COMMITTEE AND I HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH CONSTITUENTS AND THE RULES COMMITTEE AND DIFFERENT COUNCILMEMBERS TO TRY AND CLARIFY EXACTLY IN THE DIGITAL AGE OF 2019 WHERE WE STAND ON FOIA. TO MY KNOWLEDGE, WE -- IN OUR RULES BOOKLESS, WE  -- RULES BOOKLET, WE HAVE A BRIEF RULE 18, SAYING THAT WE WILL USE OUR EMAIL, AND THAT DOES NOT -- TO THE COMFORT LEVEL OF MY CONSTITUENTS, DEFINE WHAT IS CAMPAIGN DISCUSSION, WHAT IS POLITICAL DISCUSSION. AND WHAT IS COVERED BY FOIA AS A GOVERNMENTAL FUNCTION. SO I HOPE TO -- THIS WEEK, IN THE NEXT DAY OR TWO OR THREE RESUMMARIZE FOR MAYBE A THIRD TIME
