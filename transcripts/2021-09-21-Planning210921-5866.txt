00:00:11.825: >> CHAIR MILLS: ITEM 5. ALL OF THE REPORTS. LET'S START WITH COUNCILMEMBER DISCH.
00:00:21.835: >> COUNCILMEMBER DISCH: ONE THING, THE ORDINANCE CHANGE TO REMOVE WAREHOUSING AND STORAGE IN C2B DISTRICT PASSED ON FIRST READING UNANIMOUSLY WITHOUT EVEN A TWITTER OF COMMENT.
00:00:39.587: >> CHAIR MILLS: VERY GOOD. MR. LEONARD ANYTHING ELSE TO REPORT? COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDAL, ARE YOU REPORTING OUT?
00:00:57.671: >> YEAH, FOR DDA. ALL GROUP THE COMES IN FROM DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS AND IT IS ALWAYS A GREAT FORUM FOR HEARING WHAT IS HAPPENING UNTIL A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT ARE TANGENTIALLY RELATED.
00:01:12.286: >> VICE-CHAIR GIBB-RANDAL: LET'S SEE, I DON'T KNOW IF PEOPLE ARE FOLLOWING THE FACT THAT THERE IS A SOCIAL DISTRICT ZONE DOWNTOWN WHERE YOU CAN CARRY DRINKS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. THE OTHER BIG ONE IS THAT THE BUS STATION ON FULLER WAS REJECTED FOR GRANTS SO WE ARE PRETTY MUCH NOW SET WITH THE ONE DOWN ON DEEP HOE (APPROXIMATE SOUND) WE HAVE HAD A FEW DEVELOPMENTS IN THAT AREA, IS NOT THAT THE CITY HAS DECIDED THAT WE ARE DOING DEEP HOE. WE ARE DECIDING BETWEEN THE TWO AND THE -- THE ONLY TWO THAT WERE LOOKED AT IN ANY KIND OF SERIOUS WAY. AND YOU KNOW WE HAVE HAD SOME DEVELOPMENTS DOWN IN THAT AREA. THIS IS WHAT I HEARD FROM ANOTHER CITY COUNCIL PERSON. --- SO ANYWAY, THAT HAS AN IMPACT ON WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT DOWN IN THAT AREA. --- LET'S SEE. I THINK THE OTHER PIECE WAS THAT  DIVISION IS GOING TO HAVE A TWO WAY PROTECTED BY CLAIM THAT IS COMING AND THERE MAY BE A CURVE THERE. AS PART OF THAT. AND THEN THERE HAS BEEN SOME ISSUES AROUND MAINTENANCE  AND SOMEBODIES AND SO THE DIVIDED THINGS MAY BE DIFFERENT IN THE WINTERTIME, THINGS THAT WE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT AND THE OTHER THING IS I KNOW MANY OF US ARE BIKERS, AND I'M GOING TO PUT THIS OUT THERE. THE BUSES ARE HAVING A HARD TIME TURNING AT 5TH AVE. ON TO WILLIAMS BECAUSE THE BIKES ARE OUT OF THE GREEN BOX TOO FAR FORWARD. A REMINDER TO ALL OF US WATCHING OR PARTICIPATING IN THIS MEETING, STAY IN OUR GREEN BOX AS WE COME UP TO INTERSECTIONS BECAUSE IT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT -- ALL THE TURNING RADII HAS BEEN WORKED OUT SO WE NEED TO STAY IN OUR LANES. JUST A FRIEND A REMINDER TO DO THAT. --- WE ALSO GOT A BIG PRESENTATION ON THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING PIECE FROM JENNIFER HALL AND LOOKING AT THE PLANS AS THINGS ARE MOVING FORWARD, NOTHING THAT IS TERRIBLY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE LOOKED AT BEFORE BUT WE HAVE BEEN IN CLOSE CONTACT WITH THIS PROJECT AS THEY MOVE THROUGH, SO THAT IS IT.

KOWALSKI WILL BE MAKING THE STAFF PRESENTATION.
00:10:38.484: >> ARE WE GOING TO HAVE THE PETITIONER PRESENT?
00:10:41.922: >> YES GOOD EVENING. I AM GOING TO SHARE MY SCREEN ALRIGHT. GOOD EVENING PLANNING COMMISSION THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HEARING A PROJECT IS ENDING AND MY NAME IS JASON -- AND I WORK FOR -- WE ARE THE ENGINEERS/SURVEYORS/LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTS FOR THIS PROJECT IN OUR OFFICE IS LOCATED AT -- MILLER ROAD IN THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR AND I AM JOINT 11 MY COLLEAGUE BRANDON CHENEY ALSO WITH NADERBELT (APPROXIMATE SOUND) AND -- WHO IS A REPRESENTATIVE FOR GRACE BIBLE CHURCH. --- BEFORE I GET STARTED I WANT TO GIVE A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE GRACE BIBLE CHURCH IN ANN ARBOR. IT HAS BEEN PART OF THE ANN ARBOR COMMUNITY FOR NEARLY A CENTURY, FROM THE MID-1940S UNTIL 1970 THE CONGREGATION OCCUPIED THE BUILDING LOCATED AT 100 N. STATE STREET IN DOWNTOWN ANN ARBOR. IN THE EARLY 1950S RACE BIBLE CHURCH BEGAN PURCHASING PROPERTY ALONG MAPLE ROAD AND BY 1955 THEY HAVE PURCHASED ALL THE REMAINING PROPERTY BASICALLY WHERE OUR SITE PLAN THAT WE ARE PRESENTING TO YOU TODAY IS LOCATED. --- IN 1960, CONSTRUCTION BEGAN ON THEIR NEW BUILDING AND BY 1970 THEY HAD MOVED IN TO THEIR NEW FACILITY THAT IS CURRENTLY LOCATED AT 1300 SOUTH MAPLE. OVER THE NEXT 45 YEARS, NOT A LOT CHANGED ON THE SIDE OR WITH THE BUILDING. IT BASICALLY REMAINED THE SAME, UNTIL 2017 WHEN THEY CAN CONSTRUCTED A NEW ENTRYWAY OR FOYER THAT IMPROVES CIRCULATION AROUND THE FRONT OF THE CHURCH BUILDING AND PROVIDED A MUCH NEEDED GATHERING SPACE FOR PEOPLE TO USE AS THEY CAME IN AND OUT OF THE BUILDING. --- AS PART OF THIS PROJECT, SEVERAL OTHER IMPROVEMENTS AND UPGRADES WERE MADE TO THE BUILDING INCLUDING UPDATES TO THE SANCTUARY, RENOVATIONS TO THE BATHROOMS, IMPROVING ADA ACCESS AND FIRE SUPPRESSION WAS ALSO ADDED TO THE MAJORITY OF THE EXISTING BUILDING. --- AND THAT BRINGS US TO TONIGHT, INTO OUR REQUEST THAT IS BEFORE YOU FOR THIS EVENING FOR THE SITE PLAN AND THIS IS A RENDERING THE PROPOSED SITE PLAN. THERE ARE THREE MAIN COMPONENTS THAT I WANT TO TOUCH ON TONIGHT. THE FIRST OF WHICH IS WHAT WE ARE CALLING THE FAMILY CENTER A 30,800 SQUARE-FOOT ADDITION LOCATED ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE PROPOSED BUILDING SO. THIS IS THE ADDITION THEY DID IN 2017 AND THIS IS THE PROPOSED FAMILY CENTER ADDITION. --- THE SECOND MAJOR ITEM THAT I WANT TO TOUCH ON IS PARKING. THERE ARE 107 PROPOSED PARKING SPACES THAT ARE SHOWN HERE JUST WEST OF THE FAMILY CENTER ADDITION AND THE THIRD THING IS THE SANCTUARY EXPANSION WHICH IS INFIELD, THERE ARE TWO EXISTING COURTYARDS AND THE PROPOSAL IS TO INFILL THOSE COURTIERS TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SEATING IN THE CENTURY. --- THE SITE PLAN CONTAINS VARIOUS OTHER IMPORTANT ELEMENTS. THERE ARE SEVERAL WORTH NOTING. INCREASED SITE ACCESS TO THE SOUTH, THROUGH TWO DRIVEWAYS, HERE AND HERE. AND ULTIMATELY TO THE SHARED DRIVE THAT WILL CONNECT TO PAULINE AND MAPLE. THERE IS A SIGNALIZED INTERSECTION THERE. CURRENTLY THERE IS ONLY ONE ACCESS POINT TO THE SITE, THESE TWO ADDITIONAL DRIVES WILL GREATLY IMPROVE ACCESS AND WE HAVE A SHARED DRIVEWAY WITH THIS MIDTOWN PROJECT OF THE SOUTH, SO THIS WILL GREATLY IMPROVE TRAFFIC CIRCULATION AROUND THE SITE. --- ANOTHER IMPORTANT FEATURE TO NOTE IS THAT WE ARE PROPOSING INSIDE WHAT CONNECTION, A PEDESTRIAN CONNECTION FROM THE SOUTH MAPLE PUBLIC SIDEWALK ALONG THE NORTH DRIVEWAY TO THE EXISTING BUILDING AND CURRENTLY THERE IS NO PEDESTRIAN CONNECTION. PEOPLE THAT COME OR WALK TO THE CHURCH HAVE TO WALK UP THE DRIVEWAY AND WE ARE ALSO PROVIDING PEDESTRIAN ACCESS TO THE MIDTOWN SITE THROUGH THE SHARED INGRESS EGRESS THAT WILL GIVE YOU ACCESS TO THE FAMILY CENTER ADDITION. --- AND LASTLY I MENTIONED THAT WE ARE PROPOSING STORE MANAGEMENT FACILITIES. THIS WILL BE A SHARED USE SYSTEM THAT WILL BE SHARED BETWEEN THE MIDTOWN PROJECT AND THE GRACE BIBLE CHURCH PROJECT BUT IT IS LOCATED ON THE GRACE BIBLE CHURCH PROJECT. --- THIS IS AN OVERALL FLOOR PLAN OF THE PROPOSED FAMILY CENTER ADDITION. IMPORTANT ELEMENTS INCLUDE A PROPOSED GYMNASIUM, AND FULL-SIZE GYMNASIUM. YOUTH PROGRAM SPACE. THIS SERVES THE MIDDLE SCHOOL AND HIGH SCHOOL. AND THEN CHILDREN CLASSROOMS FOR NURSERY ALL THE WAY TO FIFTH GRADE, LOCATED IN THIS AREA. --- THERE'S ALSO CHURCH OFFICES. STORAGE, SEVERAL COMMON AREAS FOR GATHERINGS. AN INDOOR PLAY AREA AND THE MAIN ENTRY FOR THIS FAMILY CENTER ADDITION IS ACTUALLY TO THE WEST, OUT TO THE WEST PARKING AREA, ACCESSED HERE. BUT THERE ARE ALSO INTERNAL CONNECTIONS TO THE EXISTING BUILDING. THERE ARE EXISTING HALLWAYS IN THE EXITING BUILDING THAT WOULD BE EXTENDED. --- WHEN THEY PLANNED THIS ORIGINAL CHURCH BUILDING, THEY HAD A PLAN TO EXPAND IT TO THE SOUTH SO IT MAKES SENSE THAT THESE CORRIDORS LINE UP. --- THIS IS A BIRD EYE VIEW OF THE PROPOSED FAMILY CENTER LOOKING TOWARDS THE NORTHWEST. THIS GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF THE SIZE AND SCALE OF THE ADDITION IN RELATION TO THE EXISTING CHURCH. THIS IS THE EXISTING CENTURY. THE ADDITION DATED (CORRECTION) THEY DID IN 2017. THIS IS THE PROPOSED FAMILY CENTER ADDITION, THE GYMNASIUM, THE HIGHEST POINT IN THE PROPOSED ADDITION ABOUT 29 1/2 FT. IS LOWER SECTION HERE IS WHERE ALL THE CLASSROOM WOULD BE. AND THE RAISED SECTION THAT RUNS DOWN THE CENTER IS ENTERED TO THE WEST HERE AND THIS IS THE CORRIDOR THAT LEADS DOWN THE MIDDLE. THIS IS THE INDOOR PLAY AREA. THERE ARE WINDOWS PROPOSED JUST BELOW THE ROOF LINE TO ALLOW IN NATURAL LIGHT. --- THIS IS A RENDERING OF THE WEST ENTRY TO THE PROPOSED FAMILY CENTER BUILDING LOOKING TO THE SOUTHEAST. YOU CAN SEE THE GYMNASIUM IN THE BACKGROUND. FULL HEIGHT WINDOWS ARE PROPOSED WITHIN THIS VESTIBULE AREA  TO ALLOW NATURAL LIGHT INTO THE SPACE. --- STEPPING THROUGH THE MAIN ENTRYWAY, THIS IS AN INTERNAL VIEW OF THE CENTER-- THE CORRIDOR I GUESS -- LOOKING TOWARDS THE EAST, TOWARDS SOUTH MAPLE. THE PROPOSED DESIGN ALLOWS FOR MAXIMUM NATURAL LIGHT AND FLOW THROUGHOUT THE SPACE. THIS ENTRY WAS DESIGNED TO MIRROR THE ENTRY THAT WAS DONE ON THE FRONT OF THE CHURCH, THE 2007 ADDITION TO TIE EVERYTHING TOGETHER. --- THE NEXT MAJOR COMPONENT OF THE SITE PLAN IS THE 107 ADDITIONAL PARKING SPACES THAT ARE PROPOSED TO THE SOUTHWEST OF THE PROPOSED FAMILY CENTER BUILDING. THE EXISTING SITE CURRENTLY HAS 232 PARKING SPACES. THERE'S THREE SEPARATE LOTS IF YOU WILL. THE LOT HERE NORTH OF OUR DRIVEWAY, THIS IS HANN NATU AREA AND MATT NOTED IN HIS PLANNING REPORT THAT WE ARE WORKING ON AN AGREEMENT WITH THE CITY TO ALLOW THIS TO BE USED FOR PEOPLE TO PARK WHO WANTS TO ACCESS THE HANSEN NATURE AREA. AND THERE IS ANOTHER FAIRLY LARGE PARKING LOT HERE AND AT THE BACK OF THE EXISTING FACILITY. THE PROPOSED 107 SPACES ARE ALL LOCATED IN THIS AREA. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THESE PARKING SPACES ARE PROPOSED TO BE BUILT OVER TW PHASES. 38 PARKING SPACES IN PHASE 1 WHICH INCLUDES THESE HERE AND 69 ADDITIONAL PARKING SPACES IN PHASE 2. --- THE CHURCH FEELS THAT THE PROPOSED PARKING SPACES ARE NEEDED NOT ONLY TO MEET THE EXISTING NEEDS OF THE CONGREGATION BUT THE NEEDS OF THE PROPOSED SANCTUARY ADDITION THAT WE ARE PROPOSING. WE ARE GOING TO BE ADDING SEAT. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THERE ARE PARKING SPACES ADJACENT TO THE FAMILY CENTER BUILDING. --- AND THE LAST THING I WANT TO TOUCH ON IS THE SANCTUARY EXPANSION AND I WANT TO SHOW YOU WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE. THIS ADDITION ALLOWS THE CHURCH TO CONTINUE TO USE AND EXPAND HIS EXISTING CENTURY WITHOUT NECESSITATING THE CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW FACILITY SO WE ARE UTILIZING THE FACILITY THAT EXISTS TODAY AND EXPANDING INTO SOME COURTYARDS THAT ARE UNDERUTILIZED. --- SEVERAL STUDIES WERE COMPLETED TO ENSURE THAT THE NEW EXPANSION WAS FEASIBLE AND THAT IT WOULD WORK WITH THE EXISTING STRUCTURE. THE EXPANSION WILL PROVIDE INCREASED CITY CAPACITY AND ENHANCED ACCESS ALONG THE ALSO DECIDE THE CHURCH IS ALSO PROPOSING TO UPGRADE MANY COMPONENTS WITHIN THE EXISTING BUILDING. HVAC SYSTEM IS PART OF THIS PROJECT; THIS WILL GREATLY IMPROVE THE EXISTING BUILDING'S EFFICIENCY. MANY OF THE EXISTING HVAC COMPONENTS ARE ORIGINAL, OLD BOILERS. --- THIS IS A VIEW FROM THE STAGE LOOKING BACK. YOU CAN SEE THE EXPANDED AREA HERE-- I AM ALMOST DONE -- AND THIS IS A VIEW FROM THE BACK OF THE SANCTUARY, ONE OF THE CENTURY EXPANSIONS AND YOU CAN SEE WE ARE MAINTAINING SOME OF THE COURTYARD AND ALLOWING NATURAL LIGHT, TO GIVE YOUR VIEW OF HOW IT WOULD LOOK FROM THE BACK. THAT IS ALL WE HAVE. WE ARE HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE IN THE PROJECT. WE LOOK FORWARD TO RECEIVING RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SITE PLAN APPROVAL. THANK YOU.
00:21:54.460: >> CHAIR MILLS: THANK YOU. MR. KOWALSKI?
00:22:03.802: >> GOOD EVENING EVERYBODY. -- DID A GOOD JOB OF SUMMARIZING THE NATURE OF THE PROJECT AND THE SCOPE OF IT. I WANTED TOUCH ON A COUPLE OF HIGHLIGHTS AND ISSUES FROM A REPORT. ONE ISSUE THAT WAS NOTED IN THE STAFF REPORT THAT I WANTED TO POINT OUT IS THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE. WE HAVE USED THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USES FOR CHURCHES AND THIS HAS HAD ONE RATHER THAN THE PAST AND THE EXPANSION DOES FIT WITHIN THE PARAMETERS OF THE PREVIOUSLY ISSUED SPECIAL EXCEPTION WHICH IS WHY THEY DID NOT REQUIRE ANOTHER ONE THIS TIME. --- PARKING WAS A CONCERN OF STAFF. STAFF DID MENTION THIS REGARDING THE NUMBER OF PARKING AND AS YOU CAN SEE IN THE REPORT, AS NOTED THE PARKING DOES EXCEED WHAT IS TYPICALLY ACQUIRED FOR A CHURCH OF THAT SIZE. HOWEVER THERE ARE SOME KIND OF MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCES WITHIN THAT. TYPICALLY THOSE PARKING CALCULATIONS WERE DEVELOPED WITH THE IDEA OF ALLOWING ON STREET PARKING, ALLOWING PUBLIC PARKING WHICH I BELIEVE IS WITHIN 1000 FEET OF THE FACILITY. NEITHER ONE OF THOSE OPTIONS ARE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE AT THE SITE NO ON STREET PARKING ON PAULINE AND NO PUBLIC PARKING NEAR THE SITE SO THAT IS SOMETHING WE POINTED OUT REGARDING THE CONCERN OF THE STAFF WOULD IMPROVE SERVICES. --- AND REGARDING THE IMPERVIOUS SURFACE STORMWATER RETENTION THAT IS BEING COMBINED AT THE RETENTION BASIN THIS STEP PROJECT UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE WASHTENAW COUNTY WATER RESOURCES COMMISSION AND THEY ARE WORKING WITH THE ADJACENT PROJECT TO THE SOUTH ON THE APARTMENT PROJECT. AND ADVENTURE NOTE WAS REGARDING THE EV PARKING, THE ELECTRICAL VEHICLE PARKING REQUIREMENTS. THE PETITIONER IS REQUESTING A VARIANCE ON WHAT THEY WOULD BE REQUIRED BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF REQUIRED SPACES THEY HAVE ON THE SITE, NOT THE TOTAL AMOUNT THEY PROVIDE, BASED ON THE REQUIRED PARKING IT WOULD BE 80 SPACES OF THE PETITIONER IS REQUESTING A VARIANCE OF 70 SPACES OF SO THEY WOULD BE INSTALLING 10 SPACES ON THE SIDE. AND IF THERE IS ACTION TAKEN TO NAPA PLANNING COMMISSION IS SCHEDULED FOR THE ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS TOMORROW NIGHT. HOWEVER IF IT IS POSTPONED THE NERVOUSLY THE ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS ACTION WOULD BE POSTPONED. --- STAFF AGAIN DID GO BACK AND FORTH IN DELIBERATIONS WITH THIS AND WITH THE PETITIONER, BUT REALLY THE FEELING WAS THAT IT IS THE INTENT OF ELECTRICAL VEHICLE TO IMPROVE THE SIZE, AND THE ABOUT THE SPACES THAT THEY ARE INSTALLING IN THE PROPOSED PARKING LOT, 107, DOES EXCEED THE AMOUNT THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED WHICH IS 80 EV SPACES. THEY ARE NOT TOUCHING THE OTHER PARKING LOTS AND WITHIN THE PROPOSED PARKING LOT THEY ARE DOING THE BIO-RETENTION ISLANDS AS REQUIRED BY CODE AND PREVIOUSLY SOME OF THE FRONT PARKING LOT, THERE IS A PREVIOUS SITE PLAN APPROVED THAT HAVE MODIFICATIONS BECAUSE OF THE EXISTING LANDSCAPE WITHIN THOSE ISLANDS AND THEY ARE NOT MODIFYING THOSE AT THIS TIME. --- AND AGAIN -- GOING TO THE EV PARKING, WE DO FEEL THAT THEY SHOULD TRY TO PROVIDE THE MAXIMUM GIVEN THAT THEY ARE INSTALLING A RATHER LARGE NEW PARKING LOT. --- ONE OTHER NOTE AS WELL THAT THE PETITIONER TOUCHED ON THERE IS A SMALL ENCROACHMENT OF PARKLAND BY THE EXISTING PARKING LOT IN THE NORTHEAST SECTION THERE. THAT HAS EXISTED AS FAR BACK AS WE CAN LOOK IN AERIAL PHOTOS. AND HAVE NO ISSUE WITH IT. THEY HAVE CONTINUED OVER THE YEARS TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO USE A PARKING AREA FOR THE HANSEN NATURE AREA AND THERE IS A SMALL PARK AT THE FRONT THERE. AT THIS TIME OUR LEGAL OFFICE IS WORKING ON A RECIPROCAL LICENSING AGREEMENT THAT CONTINUES TO ALLOW THAT, IT IS A SMALL ENCROACHMENT BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD WANT TO ADDRESS GOING FORWARD. GRACE BIBLE CHURCH HAS INDICATED THAT THEY HAVE NO PROBLEMS WITH THAT AND ARE FULLY IN FAVOR OF AN AGREEMENT IN THAT AREA. --- AND THAT CONCLUDES MY PRESENTATION. AGAIN STAFF IS RECOMMENDING APPROVAL, HOWEVER CONTINGENT ON -- OH, THE PHOTOMETRIC PLAN WHICH IS SOMETHING THE POINTED OUT TO THE PETITIONER BECAUSE OF THE RECENT CHANGES APPROVED BY CITY COUNCIL, THEIR PLAN AGAIN GOING FORWARD TO CITY COUNCIL WOULD HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THOSE. AND THEY HAVE INDICATED THAT IS NOT AN ISSUE, THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE TURNED IN AT A LATER TIME, AND THE OTHER CONDITION IS A PROVISION OF THE REQUIRED AMOUNT OF EV PARKING OR A VARIANCE BEING GRANTED BY THE ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS WHICH IS ON THE SCHEDULE FOR TOMORROW NIGHT BASED ON THE ACTION TONIGHT. THAT CONCLUDES MY PRESENTATION AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU.
00:27:23.722: >> CHAIR MILLS: THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. NEXT UP IS THE PUBLIC HEARING. SO THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PERSONS TO SPEAK FOR UP TO THREE MINUTES ABOUT THE PROPOSED 1300 SOUTH MAPLE SITE. IF YOU WISH TO ADDRESS THE PLAN COMMISSION ON THIS ITEM AND YOU HAVE JOINED US VIA PHONE PRESS *NINE. IF YOU HAVE JOINED THROUGH THE WEB LINK YOU CAN USE THE RAISE HAND FEATURE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN; OR IF YOU'RE WATCHING US AND WANTS TO CALL AND NOW THE NUMBER IS 877-853-5247. AND THE MEETING ID IS 977 6634 1226. MR. LENART WILL SELECT COLORS THAT HAVE RAISED THEIR HAND, EITHER: ON YOU BY THE LAST THREE DIGITS OF YOUR TELEPHONE NUMBER OR THE NAME THAT YOU HAVE USED TO JOIN VIA ZOOM. YOU WILL HEAR AN AUTOMATED ANNOUNCEMENT WITH THE HOSTESS ALLOWING YOU TO SPEAK. PLEASE MOVE TO A QUIET AREA AND MUTE ANY BACKGROUND SOUND SO WE CAN HEAR YOU CLEARLY AND PLEASE ALSO STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS THE BEGINNING OF YOUR COMMENTS. I SEE NO ONE. ALL RIGHT. THAT WAS PROBABLY LONG ENOUGH. I WILL READ THE PROPOSED MOTION AND IF SOMEBODY JOINS -- THANK YOU MR. LENART. ALL RIGHT. THE PROPOSED MOTION IS: THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION RECOMMENDS THAT THE MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL APPROVED THE GRACE BIBLE CHURCH SITE PLAN AT 1300 SOUTH MAPLE ROAD SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS: ONE, SUBMISSION OF A REVISED CODE COMPLIANT PHOTOMETRIC LAND AND TWO, SUBMISSION OF HER VICE SITE PLAN PERFECTING EITHER THE PROVISION OF 23 EV-INSTALLED PARKING SPACES, 23 EV-READ VEHICLE PARKING SPACES AND 34 EV- CAPABLE SPACES OR THE NUMBER OF EV PARKING SPACE REQUIRED IN ANY VARIANCES GRANTED BY THE ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS. COULD I HAVE A COMMISSIONER MOVE THAT? MOOD BY COMMISSIONER SAUVE SECOND BY COMMISSIONER DISCH. ANY DISCUSSION?
00:29:43.929: >> COMMISSIONER DISCH: I WANT TO MAKE SURE I AM COMPLETELY FOLLOWING THE LOGIC OF THE PARKING AND THE EV PARKING AND THE STAFF REQUIREMENT. THE EV TOTAL OF 80 IS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF REQUIRED SPACES, MINIMUM WHICH IS 223. NOT CALCULATED BASED ON THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SPACES NOR IS IT CALCULATED BASED SOLELY ON THE SPACES THEY PROPOSE TO ADD?
00:30:24.503: >> THAT IS CORRECT.
00:30:27.439: >> COMMISSIONER DISCH: COOL. AND THEY WANT TO REDUCE BY 70 WHICH IS -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT PERCENT OF 80 BUT IT IS A LOT, THE REQUIREMENT. AND THE BUILDING AND THE PARKING LOT WILL RESULT IN THE REMOVAL OF FOUR LANDMARK TREES. THEY WILL PLANT A BUNCH WHICH IS NICE -- I AM REALLY GLAD, BUT I AM FEELING A LITTLE -- I LIKE STAFF'S RECOMMENDATION THAT THEY ABIDE BY THE EV PARKING OF COURSE I'M ALWAYS WILLING TO BE TALKED OUT OF THIS. THIS IS A LOT OF PARKING. IT IS A HUGE IMPERVIOUS SURFACE. I AM SORRY THAT A TOTAL OF FOUR LANDMARK TREES HAVE TO GO AND SOME NUMBER OF THOSE ARE GOING BECAUSE OF PARKING. I UNDERSTAND THE CONSTRAINTS ON THE SITE. SO I AM UNDERSTANDING WHY THIS PARKING IS NECESSARY. BUT IT DOES FEEL LIKE A PROJECT THAT ASSUMES  THE MOST TRANSPORTATION THAT WE ARE FAMILIAR WITH NOW, WHICH IS PERSONA TRANSPTATIONINVOING S AND SO HMM, I'M SQUIRMING. I WISH WE COULD ASK THEM TO DO LESS PARKING. I THINK  THEY SHOULD DO LESS PARKING SPACES AND IF THEY WANT TO DO ALL OF THESE PARKING SPACES I WOULD LIKE TO SEE ALL OF THESE MANY EV AND I HAVE ALREADY SEE OTHER THOUGHT, SO I'M GOING TO STOP TALKING.
00:32:18.150: >> CHAIR MILLS: COMMISSIONER SAUVE.
00:32:22.487: >> COMMISSIONER SAUVE: HOW MANY PARKING SPACES ARE REQUIRED PROPOSED TO BE BUILT? MORE THAN 80?
00:32:47.579: >> CORRECT. I THOUGHT YOU SAID --
00:32:54.319: >> MR. LENART: MATT, WALK THORUGH WHAT PARKING IS REQUIRED AND WHAT THE EV SPACES WILL BE REQUIRED AND BASED ON WHAT REGULATIONS.
00:33:04.663: >> THERE'S 223 SPACES REQUIRED AND THE EV PARKING CALCULATION IS BASED ON THAT 223, NOT THE TOTAL AMOUNT THAT IS BEING PROVIDED ON THE SITE SO WHEN YOU BREAK THAT OUT IT IS -- -- I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAD A BREAKDOWN. 15% THAT ARE EV CAPABLE BUT I DON'T THINK I HAVE THAT NUMBER BROKEN OUT HERE.
00:33:33.491: >> YOU DO. YOU WANT ME TO READ IT?
00:33:37.262: >> 23 INSTALLED, THANK YOU. 23 EV-READY AND 34 EV-CAPABLE, AGAIN BASED ON THE REQUIRED AMOUNT OF PARKING FOR THE SITE NOT BASED ON WHAT IS PROVIDED.
00:33:55.814: >> >> COMMISSIONER SAUVE: SO WE WOULD BE REQUIRING 80, BUT BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF PARKING PROPOSED THEY ARE REQUIRED TO DO MORE THAN 80? OR NO EV REQUIRED ABOVE?
00:34:12.197: >> NOT REQUIRED ABOVE THAT. I'M SORRY, I MISUNDERSTOOD.
00:34:17.669: >> >> COMMISSIONER SAUVE: I AM PULLED WITH THE EV STUFF. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE SHARED PARKING IN THE AMOUNT OF APARTMENTS THAT ARE NOT REDOING THE PARKING AREAS I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE EV PARKING IF IT GETS BUILT IN THE SHARED PARKING LOT, BECAUSE IF WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A RELIGIOUS USE -- ASSUMING A SUNDAY -- THERE IS A LOT OF TIME THAT THOSE EV SPACES ARE UNDERUTILIZED THAT THE NEIGHBORHOOD COULD FIGURE OUT HOW TO UTILIZE. AND PUTTING THEM IN THE BACK OF THE LOT DOES NOT FEEL LIKE A WELCOMING SPACE FOR OFF-SITE PEOPLE. THIS IS JUST ME THINKING OUT LOUD; THIS IS NOT REQUIRED IF THE PROJECT GETS TO THE POINT THAT THEY ARE EXPECTING. WE ARE ALREADY LAYING SIDEWALK AND THINGS AND IS A PERFECT WAY TO LAY CONDUIT UNDERNEATH TO DO IT. I THINK THE DOUBLE BENEFIT THEN IS HOW THE EV PARKING CAN SERVE SOME OF THE APARTMENT IS IN THE AREA THAT DON'T HAVE ANY EV PARKING IS AN OPPORTUNITY. MOST CHARGING STATIONS ARE CHARGED, NOT FREE PLUG-AND PLAY. THOSE ARE MY COMMENTS ON THAT. I'LL LEAVE IT TO THE ZBA FOR ANY SORT OF VARIANCE BUT AT THIS TABLE I WOULD SAY 80 IS WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR. --- MY OTHER QUESTION IS, CAN ANYBODY TELL ME ABOUT THIS PAVILION BUT DOESN'T SHOW UP  IN ELEVATION OR PLAN? IS THAT A COVERED OUTDOOR PAVILION FOR RAIN FOR THE SOCCER FIELD?
00:36:20.125: >> YES, THAT IS CORRECT. SORRY, I SHOULD'VE TOUCHED ON THAT. IT IS JUST AN OPEN SIDED COVERED PAVILION; THE USERS FEELS, THE RENT THEM OUT TO LOCAL SOCCER CLUBS AND THEY HAVE SOCCER CAMPS AND RIGHT NOW THERE IS NO STRUCTURE THERE IN CASE IT RAINS OR ANY SHELTER OF SOME KIND.
00:36:42.080: >> COMMISSIONER SAUVE: COOL. TELL ME ABOUT -- THIS IS NOT LIKE WEEKLY SCHOOL STUFF, THIS IS MAINLY SUNDAY SCHOOL  AND WHATNOT BUT FOR THE SPORTS ACTIVITIES, DO THEY IMAGINE THAT THEY MAY HAVE LITTLE LEASE AND THINGS LIKE A BASKETBALL AND SOCCER THAT WOULD UTILIZE THE BUILDING MORE SO DURING THE WEEK?
00:37:06.271: >> YES AND I MIGHT LET RAGAN CHIME IN. THE GOAL IS FOR OUTREACH; THERE'S A LOT OF COMMUNITIES ADJACENT TO THE SITE THAT COULD UTILIZE A FACILITY WITH A GYMNASIUM. THAT IS THE INTENT AND REAGAN IF YOU WANT TO ADD SOMETHING FEEL FREE TO.
00:37:29.994: >> HI, THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE. YEAH, OUR PLANNING IS TO UTILIZE THIS FACILITY FOR AS MUCH OF THE COMMUNITY CONNECTION AS WE CAN AND THAT INCLUDES THE AVALON PROJECT THAT WENT INTO THE NORTH OF US, AND SOME OF HIS OTHER GROUPS THAT WE HAVE BEEN BUILDING CONNECTIONS WITH THEM AS WE HAVE BEEN HERE ON THE SITE FOR MANY YEARS, PINELAKE AND OTHER COOPERATIVES AROUND HERE, IN HOPES THAT WE CAN PROVIDE SOME OF THOSE OPPORTUNITIES. WE ARE NOT PROVIDING A SCHOOL OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. THAT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT IS PART OF OUR FUTURE. --- BUT IN TERMS OF UTILIZING THINGS LIKE THE GYMNASIUM -- WE HAVE ONE OF THE OLD-- WE FOUND THIS ON FACEBOOK MARKETPLACE MARKET GOALS, AND FROM TIME TO TIME WE HAVE KIDS COME TO USE THAT AND THAT'S PART CAN WE PROVIDE SOMETHING LIKE A GYMNASIUM FACILITY THAT IS MORE ACCESSIBLE FOR THE COMMUNITY? AND THE IDEA OF THE PAVILION SPECIFICALLY TO YOUR POINT ON THE SOCCER FIELD IS THE SAME THING, ALONG SOMETHING FOR TEAMS TO GATHER IN CASE OF RAIN OR A ROTATING THING, A PLACE TO GET OUT OF THE SUN, THE IDEA BEHIND THAT.
00:38:48.406: >> COMMISSIONER SAUVE: ONE MORE QUESTION ON THAT. LIKE I LOVE TO SEE SPACE IS UTILIZED MORE THAN 1-2 DAYS A WEEK. I AM CURIOUS TO KNOW HOURS OF OPERATION FOR THIS ADDITION. HOW DO YOU SEE COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO ENGAGE WITH IT?
00:39:11.429: >> GOOD QUESTION. FOR THE MOST PART WE WOULD BE LOOKING AT OUTSIDE BUSINESS HOURS BECAUSE THAT IS WHEN A LOT OF CHURCH HOURS HAPPEN, WHETHER WE ARE TALKING TO THE MORNING, OUR PRIMARY TIME, OR POST FIVE O'CLOCK, AND WE ARE ABLE TO DO THAT TYPE OF STUFF. ALMOST NONE OF THE CHURCH PROGRAMMING HAPPENS FOR THE 40-50 HOUR WINDOW THAT HAPPENS AROUND REGULAR BUSINESS HOURS. SO MOST OF THAT WOULD HAPPEN OUTSIDE OF THAT, AND HOW CAN WE OPEN THE FACILITY FOR FOLKS AFTER SCHOOL OR NONPEAK TIMES IN THE SUMMER, AND POTENTIALLY DOWN THE ROAD WHAT WOULD IT LOOK LIKE FOR THE CHURCH TO UTILIZE THE GYM AS A PLACE FOR PROVIDING -- YOU KNOW WHEN THERE ARE INTERRUPTIONS IN SCHOOL LUNCH PROGRAMS, LET THERE BE A SPACE IN THE WEBSITE WHERE WE CAN USE THE FACILITY FOR THOSE TYPES OF THINGS.
00:40:05.282: >> COMMISSIONER SAUVE: EXCELLENT, THAT REALLY HELPS. WARMING SHELTERS IS ANOTHER GOOD USE OF THE GYM. NO OTHER QUESTIONS RIGHT NOW, THANKS.
00:40:16.761: >> CHAIR MILLS: OTHER COMMISSIONERS HAVE QUESTIONS OR FEEDBACK? COMMISSIONER WYCHE.
00:40:28.773: >> COMMISSIONER WYCHE: THE FIRST QUESTION IS FOR STAFF. HOW MUCH OF THE ENCROACHMENT IS INTO THE PARKLAND? YOU SAID A LITTLE BIT BUT I LOOKED AT THE MAP AND I COULD NOT GET A SENSE, I WOULD TALKING ABOUT 10 LINEAR FEET?
00:40:47.192: >> ACTUALLY --
00:40:55.734: >> CAN I SHARE? SO, I'M NOT SURE IF THIS IS THE BEST PLAN ARE NOT, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN SEE THIS ON THE SCREEN. I CANNOT ZOOM IN. THIS IS A PARKING LOT IN QUESTION AND THIS IS THE PROPERTY LINE WHERE MY CURSOR IS. YOU CAN SEE THE ENCROACHMENT IS THIS PIECE RIGHT HERE. I WOULD SAY IS PROBABLY 3-4 FT. ON THE SOUTH SIDE AND AS YOU GO NORTH IT TAPERS BACK. IT KIND OF CUTS THE DRIVEWAY IN HALF HERE. MAYBE IT IS MORE LIKE 4-5 FT. SO YEAH. THIS IS THE PORTION THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT FOR ENCROACHMENT.
00:41:39.310: >> COMMISSIONER WYCHE: I WANT TO ECHO COMMISSIONER SAUVE'S COMMENT, PUTTING EV PARKING IN THAT AREA AS YOU CONSIDER OR RESPOND TO WHATEVER THE ZONING APPEALS BOARD DECIDES, PUTTING IT THERE I THINK WOULD MAXIMIZE ITS USE ESPECIALLY SINCE ACCORDING TO YOUR PLANS YOU ARE NOT PLANNING TO HOST A DAYCARE CENTER IN THE SITE. AND SO IT SOUNDS LIKE IT WILL LARGELY JUST BE SUNDAY WORSHIP SERVICES AND POTENTIAL EVENING PROGRAMMING. SO THE SITE IS GOING TO SIT EMPTY FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE WORK WEEK AND THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT DOWNSIDE ESPECIALLY AS I LOOK AT ALL OF THE PARKING. AND THE OTHER THING I WANTED TO UNDERSTAND-- I DON'T KNOW THIS IS STAFF OR THE PETITIONER-- IS THE MIDTOWN CONDOMINIUMS HAVING PULLED THEIR PERMITS. SINCE THAT PLAN HAS BEEN APPROVED, UNLESS THEY HAVE UNLESS I COULD NOT FIND IT IN THE CITY SITES, THERE ARE GOING TO BE CONTINUATIONS TO THE PROPERTY, THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT, BUT THAT DEVELOPMENT HAS NOT MOVED FORWARD AT ALL. SO THAT WAS STATED LIKE THIS IS A BETTER WAY TO ACCESS THE BUILDING BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO COME TO THIS DEVELOPMENT BUT THAT DEVELOPMENT IS ACTUALLY NOT MOVING FORWARD AS OF RIGHT NOW LIKE NO PERMITS. I GUESS THERE IS ONE PERMIT THAT WAS APPROVED IN 2022 BUT NO OTHER PERMITS; IT DID NOT SEEM THERE WAS ANY ACTIVITY ON THE SITE SO I WANT TO UNDERSTAND HOW THEY WERE THINKING ABOUT IT, AND I KNOW THEY WERE POSITIONING THE PARKING LOT IN THREE PHASES AND A LOT OF PARKING UP WILL BE IN THE THIRD PHASE AND I WASN'T SURE IF THE TIMING WAS WHAT YOU WERE HOPING TO ACHIEVE. AND I WILL START WITH STAFF AND MR. LENART UNMUTING HIMSELF AND THEN I HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION.
00:43:56.781: >> MR. LENART: SO THE RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT ADJACENT HAS NOT STARTED CONSTRUCTION AS YOU ACCURATELY REFLECTED AND THEY ARE IN THE PROCESS OF AMENDING THEIR SITE PLAN THROUGH AN ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS BECAUSE YOU'RE MAKING SOME SLIGHT MODIFICATIONS. I THINK PART OF THAT PROBABLY MIGHT BE TO REFLECT THE ORDER OF CONSTRUCTION IN THAT REGARD. THAT ASIDE, THEY WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY-- FOR EXAMPLE IF THIS PROJECT WERE TO MOVE FORWARD THEY WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO CONSTRUCT A DRIVEWAY IF THIS SITE PL RELD ON THAT I HAVE TOCCUR. AND THAT IS IN THE CIRCUMSTANCE WITH THE DRIVER GETS BUILT I GUESS ADJACENT TO OR A COMPONENT TO THE GRACE BIBLE CHURCH DEVELOPMENT AS OPPOSED TO THE APARTMENT. AND THAT ULTIMATELY CONSEQUENCE WILL LIKELY FALL ON THE RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY ADJACENT WHERE IF THE DRIVEWAY WERE CONSTRUCTED FOR THE SHARED BENEFIT OF THE SITE, THIS SITE COULD PROCEED BUT THEN IF THEY DID NOT PROCEED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THAT ADJACENT RESIDENTIAL, IS POSSIBLE THAT THAT COULD EXPIRE AND THEY MAY HAVE TO GO TO THE SITE PLAN REVIEW PROCESS AGAIN. WE MEASURE PROGRESS BY A COUPLE OF MEASURES; YOU HAVE TO START WITHIN A CERTAIN TIMEFRAME, AND EXTEND THAT TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS, AND YOU HAVE TO MAKE STEADY PROGRESS TOWARDS COMPLETION. THOSE ARE MY INITIAL THOUGHTS. I KNOW THAT THEY ARE ACTIVELY WORKING; I CHECKED THE STATUS OF THAT ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW AND SOME FINAL ENGINEERING COMMENTS ARE DUE LATER THIS WEEK. AGAIN, DOES NOT NECESSARILY TRANSLATE TO INSTANT PERMITS BEING PULLED BUT IT THEY SEEM TO BE SUBMITTED DOCUMENTS TOWARDS THAT.
00:45:50.227: >> IF I COULD ADD TO THAT, THERE WERE TWO HOUSES ON THE PROPERTY THAT THE DEMOLISHED, THE SOLAR CONTROLS ARE IN PLACE. THEY CLOSED ON THE PROPERTY SO THEY OWN IT ALL RIGHT. ALL OF OUR COMMUNICATIONS WITH THEM IS THAT THEY ARE PROCEEDING FORWARD; THEY ARE QUITE A BIT AHEAD OF US SO EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE GOING THROUGH AN ADMINISTRATIVE AMENDMENT WAS TO HAVE THE CITY COUNCIL MEETINGS GO THROUGH AND EVERYTHING. SO WE DON'T ANTICIPATE STARTING THIS PROJECT  AT THIS POINT IS PROBABLY LOOKING LIKE THE SPRING. SO I FEEL LIKE THEY ARE GOING TO BE FAR ENOUGH AHEAD OF US -- AND WE HAVE BEEN COORDINATING WITH THEM ALL ALONG THE WAY. OFFICIALLY WE HAVE A SHARED BASE, AND ALL OF THIS AGREEMENT SO WE HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM AND WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT THEY ARE GOING TO MOVE FORWARD.
00:46:42.046: >> COMMISSIONER WYCHE: AS I WAS LOOKING AT THE SITE PLAN THERE WAS A NOTE UNDER SITE SUMMARY THAT LOOKED AT THE TRAFFIC AND I WONDER HOW THE PETITIONER ARRIVED AT THE .69 TRIPS PER OCCUPIED SEAT CALCULATION WHICH I THINK IS A HUGE PART OF THE ARTICULATION FOR THE NEED FOR THE PARKING. SO YOU'RE ONLY PROPOSING 420 SEATS IN THE SANCTUARY EVEN WITH THE ADDITIONAL UNLESS I MISUNDERSTOOD. I WANT TO ENTERTAIN THAT CALCULUS FOR THE PARKING ESPECIALLY WHEN WE ARE SEEN SUCH A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT PARKING ON THE SIDE. I KNOW YOU ARE STILL WITHIN THE ZONING SO THERE IS NO I THINK UDC CONCERNS BUT I WANT TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE PETITIONER ARRIVED AT THAT, OR IS THAT A STAFF PROVIDED CALCULUS TO HELP THEM STAY WITHIN THE UDC.
00:47:44.142: >> SO I MAY NEED REAGAN TO JOIN IN ON THIS QUESTION. WE DID HIRE A TRAFFIC CONSULTANT AND -- DID THE TRAFFIC STUDY AND THEY DID TRAFFIC COUNT DURING SUNDAY MORNING TO SEE HOW MANY ACTUAL CARS CAME OUT OF THE SITE AND TO YOUR POINT ABOUT HOW THEY EXACTLY CALCULATED HOW MANY CARS PER SEAT, I DO NOT KNOW. I BELIEVE THE EXISTING SANCTUARY HAS 400 SEATS AND WE ARE ADDING AN ADDITIONAL -- REAGAN HELP ME OUT IF YOU CAN,  I DON'T HAVE IN FRONT OF ME--.
00:48:30.588: >> YEAH, THE CURRENT SANCTUARY FACILITY HAS APPROXIMATELY 400 SEATS, THE PEWS AND DIFFICULT, PARTICULARLY IN THE COVID WORLD BUT THE EXPANSION OF A LITTLE OVER 3000 FT.2 IS A TOTAL OF ABOUT 200 USABLE SEEDS IN ADDITION TO THAT SO I THINK THE TOTAL NUMBER IS IN THE BALLPARK OF 600 WHAT WOULD HAPPEN AFTER. THOSE NUMBERS ARE NOT EXACTLY DEAD ON, BUT WE ARE LOOKING ABOUT A 50% INCREASE IN TERMS OF OUR EXISTING FACILITY, IF THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION.
00:49:18.702: >> COMMISSIONER WYCHE: YES IT DOES. MR. LENART HAS HIS HAND UP AND I DON'T KNOW IF HE SHOULD TALK BEFORE I ASK MY NEXT QUESTION.
00:49:28.379: >> MR. LENART: TYPICALLY I CANNOT SPEAK FOR THEM BUT TYPICALLY THE TRIP GENERATION ACTUALLY COME FROM THE INSTITUTE OF TRAFFIC SAFETY ENGINEERS, ITS. IT IS A NATIONALLY ADOPTED BASICALLY KIND OF A GUIDE TO TRIP GENERATION THAT WE TYPICALLY IMPOSE AND REQUIRE OUR SUBMITTERS TO ABIDE BY. AND THE TRIP GENERATION IS BASED ON BUILDING USE TYPE. AND SO YOU PUT IN WHAT THE BUILDING IS USED OR AND IT GENERATES A RATE TRIP GENERATION. I ANTICIPATE THAT IS WHERE THE NUMBER CAME FROM. I WILL SEE IF I CAN CLARIFY THAT.
00:50:17.361: >> COMMISSIONER WYCHE: AGAIN THIS IS A QUESTION FOR THE CITY OR FOR STAFF OR FOR THE PETITIONER. DURING THE PUBLIC COLLECTION PERIOD, WHERE THEY MET WITH THE NEIGHBORS, A NEIGHBOR INDICATED CONCERNS BY THE SIDEWALK AND I WANTED TO MAKE SURE IT WAS REMEDIATED AND IF IT WERE PLANNING TO BE WITH THE SITE, LIKE A BIKE ALONG THAT SIDEWALK AND ANOTHER CITY IS INVOLVED IN GETTING ANYBODY TO FIX THEIR SIDEWALKS AND ALL THAT SO LIKE THERE IS A COLLECTION OF ALL OF THOSE THINGS, BUT I THINK THE NEIGHBORS WERE MOSTLY CONCERNED ABOUT WATER RUNOFF BECAUSE THERE IS A HILL THAT COMES ALL THE WAY DOWN TO PAULINE. AND THEN WITHOUT THERE BEING GOOD DRAINAGE AT THAT POINT, THERE CAN BE FREEZING IF IT IS RAINING AND IT CAN CAUSE OTHER THINGS AND EVEN AS MY KIDS AND I HAVE BIKED ALONG THE CORRIDOR YOU GET A LOT OF SPEED AND THEN IF YOU COME INTO THAT SPACE AND THERE'S GRAVEL AND THINGS LIKE THAT ONE CAN WIPE OUT. --- I HEARD THE PETITIONER TALK ABOUT HOW THEY WERE GOING TO BRING THE PUBLIC SIDEWALK INTO THE PROPERTY TO ACCESS IT AND I HEARD THE PETITIONER TALK ABOUT GOING UP THE DRIVEWAY TO ACCESS IT, BUT I DID NOT HEAR HOW THE SIDEWALK THAT IS RUNNING ALONG I THINK THIS OUTSIDE OF THE PROPERTY --I'M REALLY BAD WHEN I AM NOT LOOKING AT THE MAP -- IF SOMEBODY COULD ADDRESS THE SIDEWALK. AND THAT IS ALL I HAVE FOR NOW, BUT I MAY HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION IN A MINUTE.
00:51:54.258: >> YES THAT IS A GOOD QUESTION. AS PART OF THE MIDTOWN PROJECT IMPROVEMENTS THEY ARE BASICALLY RECONSTRUCTING -- OR CONSTRUCTING A NEW DRIVEWAY APPROACH OF THE INTERSECTION OF PAULINE. THAT IS THE AREA THAT IS USUALLY THE BIGGEST ISSUE BECAUSE IT IS AT THE LOW POINT OF THE HILL. WATER WOULD SIT BETWEEN THE GRASS AREA BETWEEN THE CURB AND THE SIDEWALK AND THAT IS ALL GETTING REBUILT AS PART OF THE PROJECT. I THINK THAT WILL FIX MOST OF THE PROBLEMS. --- THERE STILL IS SOME GRASS AREA FROM THE GRACE BIBLE CHURCH SITE THAT SLOPES TO THE EAST TOWARDS SOUTH MAPLE BECAUSE THE CHURCH SITS UP ON A HILL. THAT IS SOMETHING WE HAVE TO KEEP ON TOP OF. I DON'T KNOW THAT WE CAN FIX ALL THE GRADING IF YOU WILL; I THINK FIXING THE DRAINAGE OF THE BOTTOM WHERE IT COLLECTED BEFORE IS A BIG IMPROVEMENT PLAN START CONCERN. I DON'T KNOW THERE'S A WAY TO FIX ALL OF IT ALONG OUR WHOLE FRONTAGE BUT WE ARE FIXING IT AT THE BOTTOM WHERE WATER COLLECTED BEFORE.
00:53:12.403: >> COMMISSIONER WYCHE:
00:53:13.537: >> I DID SEE THE MAJORITY OF THAT ISSUE, YOU CAN SEE A LITTLE BIT OF WATER AND TECHNICALLY IT IS JUST OFF THE SITE BECAUSE IT IS ON THE MIDTOWN SITE BUT IT IS AT THAT INTERSECTION. WHEN THAT IS CONSTRUCTED IT WILL BE FIXED BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO SHUT OFF THERE. WHAT WE DID IS TO-- I HAD OUR SOIL EROSION GUY REFERRED AND HE SAID HE DID GO OUT THERE AGAIN TO INSPECT AND TO MAKE SURE THERE WASN'T ANY LIKE EXCESSIVE RUNOFF AT THAT LOCATION OR ANYTHING ELSE LIKE THAT. MOST OF THAT ISSUE, WALKING IN FRONT OF THE GRACE BIBLE CHURCH ITSELF -- AGAIN IT WAS A NICE DAY, IT WAS NOT RAINING AND NO SNOW OBVIOUSLY AND THAT MAY ADDRESS SOME OF YOUR QUESTIONS.
00:54:18.802: >> COMMISSIONER WYCHE: I REMEMBER MY LAST QUESTION. IN PHASE 3 THE LAST PARKING LOT THAT YOUR ADDING-- AND THIS MAY BE A QUESTION FOR STAFF-- IS THERE A WAY FOR US TO DO PARKING IN THAT PHASE 3 BECAUSE THAT IS GRASS NOW, THEY WILL BE CLEARING THE SPACE TO PUT ASPHALT. IS THERE A WAY TO PUT IN A GRASS PARKING LOT?
00:54:48.265: >> CODE DOES NOT ALLOW THAT. CODE REQUIRES IT TO BE PAVED.
00:54:54.571: >> COMMISSIONER WYCHE: THAT WAS MY QUESTION. THANK YOU.
00:54:57.908: >> CHAIR MILLS: MR. LENART GO AHEAD.
00:55:00.911: >> MR. LENART: I WAS WRONG. LET ME EXPLAIN HOW THE TRIP GENERATION WAS GENERATED. THEY CALCULATED -- THE ACTUALLY MEASURED TRIP GENERATION BASED ON THE USE OF THE CHURCH. IT WAS DONE DURING COVID -- I'M CALLING FROM THE TRAFFIC IMPACT STUDY -- THE CHURCH CURRENTLY HAS 168 SEATS OCCUPIED. THEREFORE WHAT THEY DID IS THEY MEASURED THE INGRESS AND EGRESS OF ALL THE TRIPS FROM MULTIPLE SERVICE TIMES AND FIGURED OUT THE TOTAL TRIPS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF SEATS AND OCCUPANTS. SO WHEN AGGREGATING ALL OF THOSE INGRESS AND EGRESS SERVICES THEY GENERATED THE .69 TRIPS PER SEAT SO THEY USE THAT DATA AS A WAY TO CALCULATE THE EXPANSION OF THE SANCTUARY IT WAS NOT STRICTLY AS I MENTIONED A RATIO FROM THE MANUAL. THEY USED ACTUAL DATA UTILIZATION OF THEIR TRIPS ON SITE AND PROJECTED THAT SAME RATE TO THE EXPANDED CAPACITY.
00:56:24.961: >> CHAIR MILLS: OTR QUESTIONS, COMMENTS? COMMISSIONER HAMMESCHMIDT?
00:56:34.638: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT: WANT TO MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND THE SHARED DRIVEWAY THAT COMES UP ON PAULINE. SO THE TWO DRIVERS GOING TO FEED INTO THAT ROAD, RIGHT? SO SOMETHING WOULD HAPPEN IN MIDTOWN, ARE THEY STILL IN THE HOPE TO BUILD DISAROUSLY WRO WITH AT  NT PROJEC OR WOULD WE (INDISCERNIBLE)?
00:57:16.880: >> IF MIDTOWN WERE TO CONSTRUCT -- I WANT TO MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTION -- MIDTOWN COULD ONLY CONSTRUCT THAT DRIVEWAY BECAUSE THEY HAVE SOME ARRANGEMENT WITH GRACE BIBLE CHURCH FOR THAT ACCESS. IF THEY DID THAT, THEY COULD CONSTRUCT THAT PORTION BASICALLY TERMINATE IT AND THEY COULD STOP. AND THAT WOULD MEET THE REQUIREMENTS IF PRESUMABLY THE GRACE BIBLE CHURCH PROCESS GOES THROUGH. --- ALTERNATIVELY, GRACE BIBLE CHURCH COULD ELECT TO CONSTRUCT THE DRIVE TO FINISH THEIR DEVELOPMENT. TO BE CLEAR THOUGH, IF WE ARE APPROVING A SITE PLAN THAT RELIES UPON THAT, ONE OF THOSE TWO THINGS WOULD HAVE TO HAPPEN. THAT WOULD NOT HAVE THE IMPACT OF NECESSITATING THAT MIDTOWN ABSOLUTELY MOVE FORWARD WITH THE DEVELOPMENT. BUT AS YOU HEARD FROM ALL OF MY OBSERVATIONS AND MR. -- WE ANTICIPATE THAT WOULD HAPPEN SO THE SHORT OF IT IS THAT THAT DRIVEWAY IS AFFECTED TO BE ANTICIPATED TO BE CONSTRUCTED AT A TIME WHERE IT CAN BE USED FOR THE BENEFIT OF THESE CONNECTIONS WITH GRACE BIBLE AND FOR SOME REASON THAT DID NOT HAPPEN THAT WOULD STILL BE REQUIRED IF FOR SOME REASON THE RACE BIBLE MOVE FORWARD WE WOULD NOT ALLOW OCCUPANCY OF THAT STRICTLY WITH THE PROMISE THAT THAT WOULD HAPPEN SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE. THAT IS PART OF ACCESS TO THE SITE AND IT WOULD HAVE TO BE REALIZED PRIOR TO THE COMPLETION OF THE GRACE BIBLE PROJECT.
00:59:11.428: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT: SO SOMEBODY HAS TO BUILD THIS.
00:59:14.832: >> MR. LENART: YEP.
00:59:18.701: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT: BEFORE COVID, WHAT WAS YOUR OCCUPANCY LIKE? THIS IS A LOT OF PARKING PUT IN AND UNDERSTAND THAT YOU PROBABLY HAVE DONE YOUR DUE DILIGENCE. IS HARD FOR ME TO IMAGINE THAT ALL THE SPOTS ARE GOING TO BE FILLED. I WANT TO HEAR A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR CONGREGATION AND YOUR OCCUPANCY, YOUR PROJECTIONS FOR FILLING THESE 200 PEWS ONCE PEOPLE FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE POST-COVID.
00:59:48.932: >> ABSOLUTELY. SO, SOME OF IT WAS ALREADY DELINEATED IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH OF OUR PARKING IS TO HAPPEN SPECIFICALLY ON OUR SITE BECAUSE NOT HAVING ACCESS TO THE PUBLIC PARKING IN THAT SORT OF THING. SOME OF THIS IS CONNECTED TO THE WAY IN WHICH WE ARE BUILDING THIS PROJECT. --- THIS CHURCH HAS BEEN ON THE SITE FOR A WHILE; WE HAVE NEVER HAD PEDESTRIAN ACCESS DIRECTLY TO THE CHURCH, WHICH IS SOMETHING WE ARE TRYING TO FIX AS A PART OF THIS BECAUSE THAT SPEAKS VOLUMES TO A COMMUNITY I THINK HONESTLY IT WE CAN BE HONEST ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT THERE IS A DOORWAY REGARDLESS OF HOW SOMEONE CHOOSES TO COME. --- BUT I THINK SOME OF THAT IS REFLECTED BY THE POPULATION OF OUR CHURCH FOR THE MOST PART WHICH IS WE ARE PRIMARILY A COMMUTER CHURCH. SO WE HAVE -- AS FAR AS MYLAN AND CHELSEA WE HAVE CELINE AND DOWNTOWN SO NOBODY AREA. DEXTER AND CELINE. AND SO AS A RESULT WE HAVE A LOT OF YOUNG FAMILIES. --- TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF WHERE WE ARE IN TERMS OF POPULATION, WE WERE UTILIZING OUR FACILITY FOR THREE SERVICES WHICH WAS MENTIONED IN THE TRAFFIC STUDY, AND THOSE THINGS WERE THERE. WE WERE FILLING TWO OF THE SERVICES TO CAPACITY PRIOR TO COVID. WE WERE RUNNING -- AGAIN BECAUSE OF COVID DISTANCING AND SOME OF THOSE THINGS IN ORDER TO COMPLY OUR NUMBERS ARE DIFFERENT AT THE MOMENT BUT WHAT WAS LARGELY INCLUDED ON A GIVEN SUNDAY BETWEEN 10-20% OF THOSE WERE UNDER FIFTH GRADE SO A LOT OF FAMILIES. WE HAVE A 400 PERSON AUDITORIUM, BUT A TOTAL OF 800-1000 PEOPLE ON A FULL SUNDAY PRE-COVID AND LOOKING AT 100-200 BEING FIFTH-GRADE AND DOWN. --- ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THE PARKING HAS BEEN SO NECESSITATED AS WELL AS THE EXPANSION OF THE FAMILY CENTER SPECIFICALLY IS BECAUSE ALL OF OUR KIDS' SPACES PRE-COVID WERE UNDERUTILIZED  BASED ON THE CAPACITY OF THOSE ROOMS AND ALL THAT TO SAY IS WE NEEDED THIS OUTLET IN THIS LARGER SPACE. SO I DON'T KNOW THAT COMMUTER CONVERSATION ANSWERS WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR, BUT YEAH THAT IS THE MAIN REASON, WHY THIS WAS THERE. WE HAVE BEEN UTILIZING THE PERMEABLE SPACE AND STUFF LIKE THAT ON OUR SITE TO TRY TO GET ALL THE CARS HERE. AND WE HAD A PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL CARPAL SYSTEM THAT WE TRIED TO UTILIZE TO BRING STUDENTS IN FROM THE UNIVERSITY AND EVEN WITH THOSE THINGS IT IS A BATTLE OF VOLUNTEERS ARE HERE IN TAKING SPACES FOR ALL THREE SERVICES IN THOSE TYPES OF THINGS NOT ONLY THAT GIVES YOU A CLEAR PICTURE.
01:03:01.925: >> COMMISSIONER WYCHE:
01:03:04.927: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT: IT DOES YOU HAVE BEEN PARKING OFF THE NORMAL PARKING LOTS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE COMING TO SERVICES.
01:03:16.573: >> THAT IS CORRECT. I DON'T HAVE THE SPACES  IN FRONT OF ME BUT THIS IS LIKE ASKING PEOPLE WHO HAVE TRUCKS TO PULL INTO SITUATIONS LIKE THAT WHERE THEY CAN GET OUT WHICH IS NOT A GREAT SITUATION WHEN IT COMES TO THE -- I AM A FLORIDIAN, SO THE JOYS OF THE SNOW ARE NEW TO ME. SO THAT HELPS A LOT WITH OUR LOVELY WINTER STORMS HERE AT ANN ARBOR.
01:03:46.536: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT: MY LAST QUESTION, THINKING OUT LOUD. SINCE YOU ARE DOING THE PARKING AND PHASING -- HERE IS THE REAL QUESTION. DO WE HAVE TO CLEAR LIKE FOR THE WHOLE NEW PARKING LOT THE ENTIRE SITE EVEN THOUGH THE PARKING IS BEING BUILT IN TWO PHASES? DOES IT NEED TO INITIALLY ALL BE -- I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IS WHERE..
01:04:18.001: >> I CAN ANSWER THAT. A LOT OF THE STORM SEWER THAT WILL BE SERVICING THE PROPOSED BUILDING, THIS PARKING IS LOCATED BETWEEN OUR PROPOSED BILLING AND THE STORM WATER RETENTION SYSTEM AND A LOT OF STORMS PIPES AND UTILITIES CROSS THROUGH THIS AREA SO IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO PRESERVE -- THERE MAY BE SOME THINGS WE CAN DO BUT IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO PRESERVE THE ENTIRE AREA UNTIL WE GOT TO THAT PHASE.
01:04:48.965: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT: AND AGAIN, WHO KNOWS WHEN COVID IS GOING TO END. IT IS HARD TO KNOW IF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE DOING THINGS IN THE SAME MANNER THAT  THEY DID THINGS TWO YEARS AGO SO AM THINKING LIKE, IF THE PARKING IS GOING TO BE BUILT IN PHASES IS THERE AN OPPORTUNITY TO HOLD THAT AS PRISTINE AS CAN BE GIVEN THE OTHER CONSTRAINTS? AND MAKE A DECISION WHENEVER -- BEFORE PHASE 3 PARKING IS NEEDED. MAYBE THIS THIRD PHASE OF PARKING, ALTHOUGH I THINK IT DOES INCLUDE THAT DRIVEWAY.
01:05:25.668: >> I AGREE WITH YOU. ONE OF OUR RESPONSES TO THE PLANNING REVIEW WITH MATT, HE ASKED THAT QUESTION TOO. THE CHURCH RESPONDED THAT SAY WE BUILD THE FAMILY CENTER AND THE PHASE 1 PARKING. THEY ARE GOING TO EVALUATE WHERE THEY ARE AT WITH PARKING FOR THE GO IN AND SPEND THE MONEY TO BUILD THE ADDITIONAL 68 SPACES IN PHASE 3. SO THEY WILL BE LOOKING AT THAT. THEY HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT PARKING IN THE SITE SINCE 2015; I THINK THEY COUNTED EVERYTHING. THEY DON'T WANT TO BUILD ANY MORE PARKING THAN THEY NEED. THIS IS BASED ON ALL OF THE DATA AND THIS IS WHAT THEY CAME UP WITH-- THIS IS WHAT WOULD MAKE IT WORK. I THINK THEY ARE WILLING TO EVALUATE IT AFTER THE FAMILY CENTER GETS CONSTRUCTED IN THE PHASE I PARKING IS DONE AND IF IT IS NOT NECESSARY I THINK THEY'RE WILLING IF WE NEED TO GO THROUGH AN AMENDMENT OR WHATEVER TO NOT HAVE TO BUILD THAT FUTURE PARKING. THING THAT IS SOMETHING THEY WILL BE WILLING TO DO.
01:06:29.533: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT: THAT MAKES SENSE. I THINK THAT IS IT FOR NOW EXCEPT TO SAY THAT THIS IS IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT THE PARKING AGAIN AT SOME POINT, THANK YOU.
01:06:43.880: >> CHAIR MILLS: ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS? GO AHEAD COMMISSIONER CLARKE.
01:06:53.423: >> COMMISSIONER CLARKE: THE CITY HAVE ANY RECON WAS ABOUT TO GETTING (INDISCERNIBLE)? I WAS WONDERING WITH NEW APARTMENTS BUILT ON THAT SIDE OF THE ROAD WITH THE QUICK MATH, UNLESS I AM WAY OFF BASE, THE APARTMENT NEXT DOOR WITH ABOUT 100 SPACES IT'S ABOUT 18,000 SQUARE FEET OF NEW IMPERMEABLE SURFACE PLUS THIS ONE AND AGAIN THIS IS NOT EVEN COUNTING -- SOMETHING LIKE 24,000 SQUARE FEET OF NEW IMPERMEABLE SURFACE ON THAT STRETCH OF ROAD. I WANTED TO THINK AND AGAIN I MET THIS REALLY QUICK SO DON'T KNOW IF THAT IS A GOOD ESTIMATE, I WANT TO THINK ABOUT IF THERE ARE OR IF THAT IS SOMETHING WE CAN PULL OUT AND LOOK AT HEAT ISLAND MITIGATION FEATURES.
01:08:14.370: >> TO DECREASE THE NUMBER OF CASES WITHOUT THE LANDSCAPE ISLAND THAT WAS PART OF THE THINKING BEHIND IT BUT -- MAY HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE SUSTAINABILITY. I AM NOT AWARE OF ANY OTHER MITIGATION FACTORS THAT WE HAVE FOR HEAT AND EFFECTS RIGHT NOW.
01:08:30.453: >> YOU WON'T FIND ANYTHING THE CODE THAT SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSES IT BUT I THINK PART OF OUR NATURAL FEATURES IDENTIFICATION AND MITIGATION GOES TOWARDS THAT AS MATT INDICATED. SPECIFICALLY I THINK OUR PARKING AREA IS WHERE WE NOW REQUIRE VEGETATION AND LANDSCAPE AREAS AT A CERTAIN RATIO OF IMPERVIOUS SURFACE. AND OF COURSE WHENEVER WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR SITES LIKE THIS TO MOVE THEM FROM NONEXISTENT OR INADEQUATE TO MORE FUNCTIONAL STORMWATER, I THINK THAT CAN HELP WITH THAT. AND IT IS RELATED TO HEAT ISLAND BUT NOT, DIRECTLY. IT IS AN EFFECT PROBABLY THAT WE ARE MANAGING A LITTLE BIT MORE BUT THE SHORT ANSWER IS YOU WILL NOT FIND THE HEAT ISLAND SECTION IN THE CODE BUT I DO THINK SOME OF OUR REGULATIONS ATTEMPT TO MITIGATE IT.
01:09:27.977: >> CHAIR MILLS: COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDAL.
01:09:33.983: >> COUNCILMEMBER GIBB-RANDAL: I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT THAT UP COMMISSIONER CLARKE. I THINK WE DON ADESS ANY TH IN OUR DE. IS ONLY ABOUT WHAT FILLS THE VOID IN TERMS OF WHAT IS LEFT IN THE ISLANDS AND I THINK THAT IS ONE OF LIKE SMALL NUANCE THINGS THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO SHIFT IN THE CODE THAT WE HAVE CONTROL OVER WHAT WE MIGHT THINK ABOUT INSTEAD OF JUST HAVING THIS EVEN DISTRIBUTION AND LETTING THE PETITIONER PUT THEM WHERE THEY WANT BY CODE BUT ALSO WHERE THEY WANT BECAUSE OF THE MITIGATION AND THAT KIND OF THINK IT IS REALLY THINKING ABOUT SOUTHSIDE AND WESTSIDE, AND THINKING ABOUT THOSE THINGS MORE CAREFULLY THERE IS A REAL OPPORTUNITY THAT WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO CHIP AWAY AT SOME OF THESE THINGS SO OBVIOUSLY NOT FOR THIS PROJECT BUT I WOULD THINK THAT IS AN OPPORTUNITY THAT WE HAVE TO REALLY TRY TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT. AND I GUESS I WOULD ENCOURAGE THE PETITIONER THROUGH THEIR MITIGATION, I DON'T SEE ANYTHING ON THE WEST SIDE OVER HERE IN TERMS OF -- IT COULD HAVE BEEN ON THE SOUTH, AND SOME OF THAT ARE THE MITIGATION TREES THAT YOU HAVE AS WELL. IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY I THINK TO BE ABLE TO PUT SOMETHING FROM THE WEST SIDE TO BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH SOME OF THAT HOT SUN. AND FRANKLY PEOPLE LIKE TO PARK WHERE THERE IS SHADE; WE ALL KIND OF CRAVE THAT. --- AND AGAIN IT MAY NOT BE FOR THIS ROUND BUT I THINK THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE A GOOD THING FOR US TO THINK ABOUT FOR THE FUTURE. THAT ISN'T A HUGE MARKING THE ENERGY DOWN BY HUGE AMOUNT BUT EVERY LITTLE BIT HELPS AND I THINK IT WOULD BE GREAT FOR US TO START THINKING ABOUT HOW THE SUN PLAYS ON THESE DARK SERVICES THAT WE HAVE AND THE IMPACT THAT IT HAS ON OUR CITY. I WOULD HOPE THAT WE CAN MAYBE TACKLE THAT ONE AT SOME POINT WITH SOME OF OUR ORDINANCES TO THINK ABOUT FINE-TUNING SOME OF THAT TO MAKE IT MORE SENSITIVE TO SHADING ON PAVEMENT. SO I AM GLAD YOU BROUGHT THAT UP. --- I WOULD JUST SAY TERMS OF THE PROJECT, THINGS SEEM GOOD TO ME. I DON'T SUPPORT REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES. I DON'T SEE A REASON TO. AND I THINK IT IS WHERE THINGS ARE GOING AND WE ALL NEED TO DO OUR PART. I DON'T SUPPORT THAT PART OF THE GRANT, BUT IT SEEMS LIKE THINGS ARE WELL THOUGHT OUT AND OTHERWISE AND I SUPPORT FOR THE PROJECT IN GENERAL.
01:12:17.547: >> CHAIR MILLS: ALL RIGHT. ANY OTHERS? SO I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING THAT YOU ALL SSAID. I'M CURIOUS ABOUTSAI HOW THE PETITIONER ARRIVED AT THE NUMBER OF EV SPOTS AT 10.
01:12:41.937: >> I CAN ANSWER THAT. WE PROVIDED THIS AS A PART OF OUR ZB APPLICATION FOR THAT AS WELL. ESSENTIALLY WE ARE FOLLOWING THE FOOTPRINTS OFSOME OF THE EARLIER VARIANCES THAT WERE GRANTED ON THIS PROJECT, SPECIFICALLY THE ST. FRANCIS PROJECT, WHICH IS A SIMILAR PROJECT AND A SIMILAR TYPE OF USE WITH THE FACILITY SO THAT IS HOW WE ARRIVED AT THAT CALCULUS. THAT CALCULUS IS BASED ON  BASE LESS THAN THE NUMBER OF PARKING SPOTS REQUIRED MORE ON THE NUMBER OF USED PARKING SPOTS BECAUSE THIS TYPE OF LOT IS LIKE A HIGH-CAPACITY BUT LOW USAGE RATE LOT BECAUSE OF THE WAY WE UTILIZE IT ON SUNDAY MORNING PRIMARILY IN TERMS OF BEING FULL AND THEN FOR THE REST OF THE WEEK IT IS MUCH SMALLER. SO OUR NUMBER WAS BASED OFF THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES AT THE CHURCH AS OF THAT IS HOW WE ARRIVED AT THAT 10 NUMBER DOWN FROM THE 80 NUMBER, TRYING TO FOLLOW IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF THOSE VARIANCES, AND DOING SEVERAL ROUNDS WITH THE ZBA. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE COULD START THE PROCESS FROM ANOTHER PERSPECTIVE, WE COULD BE FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD AND PROPOSING WHAT WE SAW AS IN LINE WITH OUR FACILITY CONNECTED TO THEIRS AND THAT IS HOW WE CAME TO THAT NUMBER, THE IDEA OF WHEN WE LOOK AT HOW MANY SPOTS ARE BEING UTILIZED, WE DISBURSED HOW THE LOT IS USED OVER THE COURSE OF THE ENTIRE WEEK VERSUS JUST THE KIND OF HIGH WATERMARK ON SUNDAY MORNING AND THAT IS HOW WE CAME TO THAT NUMBER.
01:14:23.005: >> CHAIR MILLS: OKAY AND IS THE QUESTION FOR STAFF. THIS STRIKES ME AS A CHICKEN AND A PROBLEM. ZBA CANNOT VOTE ON THIS UNTIL WE SEND THEM SOMETHING BUT IN MY MIND AT THE VERY MINIMUM THE MULTIPLIERS THAT ARE IN THE CODE WHICH IS 10% BEING READY, 10% BEING INSTALLED AND 15% BEING CAPABLE, THOSE WERE THE PRODUCT OF WHAT IS BEING BUILT SO I ARRIVED AT 38 SPOTS MINIMUM AND THAT WOULD STILL REQUIRE A VARIANCE. BUT I CANNOT FATHOM THIS HAVING FEWER THAN 38 SPOTS SO I FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE VOTING ON A SITE PLAN THAT DOES NOT SHOW 38 SPOTS. BUT EVEN IF IT DOES SHOW 38 SPOTS, MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT -- HOW DOES THAT WORK? THEY CANNOT VOTE ON THE VARIOUS WITHOUT THAT.
01:15:27.536: >> MR. LENART: I RECOGNIZE THAT SO MATT AND I WANTED TO PROVIDE YOU WITH LUNG WHICH IT RECOGNIZES THERE IS A DECISION RELATIVE TO THIS DEVELOPMENT THAT IS OUT OF YOUR HANDS. THE ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS IS AN INDEPENDENT BODY AND THEY WILL APPLY THEIR STANDARDS ENABLE COME TO A DECISION TO EITHER GRANT A VARIANCE OR NOT. I CAN'T SPEAK FOR THE ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS. I WILL POINT OUT THAT I THINK THIS PETITION IS QUITE DIFFERENT THAN THE PREVIOUS ONE THAT WAS REFERENCED; THE DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN THE TWO PROJECTS-- THE PROPOSED IMPROVEMENTS TO THE OTHER CHURCH WAS AN ADDITION THAT NECESSITATED NO CHANGE TO THE PARKING LOT. THIS IS COMING WITH AS WE NOTED A PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL NEW AND EXPANSION OF THE PARKING LOT. I THINK THE INTENTION OF THE ORDINANCE IS JUST THAT, WHEN PARKING IS GOING IN WHAT IS THE OPPORTUNITY TO FUTURE PROOF TO THE CHANGING TRENDS IN TRANSPORTATION? --- I GUESS I WOULD -- IF YOU ARE NOT COMFORTABLE IS YOUR PREROGATIVE IF YOU NEED MORE INFORMATION. THE DECISION OF THE ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS IS GOING TO BE IMPACTFUL ONE WAY OR ANOTHER IF NO VARIANCE IS GRANTED THEN THE SITE PLAN IS GOING TO HAVE TO REFLECT THE REQUIRED SPACES OF 80; IF A VARIANCE IS GRANTED AND THE SITE PLAN IS REVISED TO MEET THAT, IS GOING TO MEET THE STANDARDS OF THE CODE IN THE SAME. SO AT THAT POINT, IF HER SOME REASON THE ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS GRANTED THAT VARIANCE AND YOU WERE NOT COMFORTABLE UNTIL YOU KNEW THAT I WOULD POINT OUT THAT, AT THAT POINT THE STANDARD IS NOT GOING TO BE 80, IS GOING TO BE WHATEVER THE VARIANCE IS GRANTED FOR THAT NUMBER OF SPACES, THAT IS WHY WE PROPOSE THAT AS IT IS. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS.
01:17:36.331: >> CHAIR MILLS: SO CHANNELING -- WHAT I WANT TO SAY IS-- YOU STAFF ARE OUR LINK WITH THE ZBA. WHEN THERE IS AN OPENING SOMEBODY ELSE WILL VOLUNTEER.
01:17:53.616: >> MR. LENART: I WANT TO SHARE ONE MORTAL POINT. WE SHARE THE SAME SORT OF ANALYSIS THAT WE SHARED WITH THE PLAN COMMISSION STAFF REPORT AND THE ZONING REPORT SO WE ARE BEING CONSISTENT IN OUR COMMUNICATION WITH OUR STAFF OBSERVATIONS BUT JUST LIKE YOU ARE PLANNING YOUR STANDARDS THE ZBA IS GOING TO APPLY THE STANDARDS ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.
01:18:26.849: >> CHAIR MILLS: THE LANGUAGE IS STRONGER HERE. FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH IF THERE'S ANY ZBA MEMBER LISTENING HAVING THAT MULTIPLIER IS IMPORTANT TO ME. I CANNOT FATHOM PUTTING IN NEW PARKING WHERE YOU DON'T HAVE AT LEAST THAT, IN THE LAST ON THAT WE WERE IN A SIMILAR SITUATION WHERE EV PARKING CAME INTO PLAY AND OUR DISCUSSION WAS -- THAT SITE PLAN THAT WE SAW WAS AT LEAST HAVING THOSE MULTIPLIERS APPLY TO THE NEW STUFF. AND THAT IS WHERE I AM -- I AM UNCOMFORTABLE. ESPECIALLY BUILDING PARKING THAT MAY ONLY BE USED YOU KNOW ACCORDING TO THE RATIONALE, ONLY BE USED FOR SMALL PORTION OF THE WEEK. PART OF THE REASON THAT WE HAVE THIS IN HERE IS TO MAKE SURE THAT ANY NEW PARKING THAT WE HAVE HERE IS FUTURE PROOFED. THIS MAKES ME REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE SO ACTUALLY I WILL SAY THAT I DON'T PLAN TO SUPPORT THIS UNLESS IT CAN SHOW IN MY MIND AT LEAST THOSE 38 CHARGERS OR 38 SPOTS THAT AT MINIMUM -- I COULD VOTE IN FAVOR OF THIS IF IT HAD AT LEAST THAT KNOWING THAT ZBA COULD DECIDE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 38 AND 80. I CANNOT SUPPORT IT WITH ONLY 10. COMMISSIONER WYCHE.
01:20:02.979: >> COMMISSIONER WYCHE: THIS IS FOR STAFF. I WE ABLE TO SEND A MEMO TO THE ZBA WITH THE CONCERNS THAT THE CHAIR HAVE JUST ARTICULATED? I THOUGHT THERE WAS A WAY TO COMMUNICATE OR DO WE DO THAT IN THE ACTUAL MOTION FOR WE REVISE THE MOTION TO FIT WHAT WE ARE HOPING TO ACHIEVE?
01:20:27.302: >> MR. LENART: YOU CAN SEND A COMMUNICATION. IF THAT WAS A DESIRE THAT THE COMMISSION WANTS TO TAKE ACTION ON, TO REFLECT THE COMMISSION AS A BODY, I WOULD JUST FRAME IT AS YOU KNOW THE ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS APPLIES A STANDARD JUST LIKE YOU DO. I WOULD KEEP IN THE BACK OF YOUR MIND THE KIND OF COMMUNICATION THAT YOU THINK WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR THE ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS AS TO HOW YOU WANT TO SHARE THAT. YES, YOU CAN DO THAT.
01:21:07.142: >> COMMISSIONER WYCHE: IT FEELS LIKE EVEN BY THE PETITIONER'S ARTICULATION, THEY GRANTED THIS EXCEPTION AND WE ARE HOPING THEY WILL GRANT OUR EXCEPTION AS WELL. NOW THERE IS THIS ISSUE AROUND LIKE IS A PRECEDENT BEING SET? AND THAT UNDERMINES THE VERY GOAL OF THESE INITIATIVES. --- SO SHORT OF ASKING THE ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS TO DO WHAT WE WANT, WE DO WANT TO SAY NO WE DON'T WANT TO SET A PRECEDENT WHERE THESE KINDS OF SITES THAT COME THROUGH ARE SHIFTED. TRYING TO BE RESPECTFUL TO THE POINT THAT YOU JUST MADE. --- MY OTHER COMMENT WAS BACK TO THE PETITIONER. I DID NOT NOTE IN ANY OF THE ELEVATION OR SITE PLANS REVIEW THAT YOU ARE CONSIDERING SOLAR AND I WONDERED WHY YOU'RE NOT, ESPECIALLY WITH ALL OF THISEW CONSTRUCTION, CONSIDERG ANY TERNATIVE ENERGY URCES EITHER GEOTHERM OR SOLAR.
01:22:29.424: >> GREAT QUESTION. WE ARE CONSIDERING. WE ACTUALLY HAVE SOME PROCESSORS WE ARE WORKING WITH HARVEST SOLAR WE HAVE A CONNECTION TO ONE OF OUR ELDERS. SOME OF THE RESOURCES REQUIRED ON THE FRONT SIDE WHICH IS TRUE FOR BOTH THE EV STANDARD AND THE SOLAR SIDE SOME OF THOSE THINGS ARE CONTINGENT ON WHAT ARE WE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO IN TERMS OF THE OVERALL FINANCES TO DO THAT BUT WE ARE ABSOLUTELY IN THE PROCESS OF LOOKING INTO SOLAR AND SOME OF THOSE THINGS. I HAVE AN EMAIL IN MY INBOX FROM ONE OF THE REPS OVER THERE ASKING FOR THE SAME PLANS YOU RECEIVED TO LOOK AT WHAT SQUARE FOOTAGE WILL BE AVAILABLE WHEN WE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ROOFTOP UNITS THOSE TYPES OF THINGS IS PART OF THE FACILITY BEING PROPOSED AND HOW WE CAN UTILIZE THOSE THINGS SO YEAH WE ARE AWARE, WE ARE OPEN TO THIS ALTERNATIVE ENERGY CONVERSATION.
01:23:33.121: >> CHAIR MILLS: ONE OF THE THINGS -- I GUESS THAT SOMETIMES HAPPENS IS I MADE KNOWN HOW I PLAN TO VOTE. I WONDER IF THE PETITIONER HAS AN INTEREST IN SHOWING 38 SPOTS ON HERE, OR COMMITTING TO 38 SPOTS. LET ME LEAVE IT THERE.
01:24:00.582: >> I'LL JUMP IN AT THAT POINT. ACTUALLY THE PLANS YOU HAVE NOW MEET ALL OF THE EV STATUS AS DISPLAYED. I BELIEVE WE HAVE 23 EV CHARGING STATIONS THAT CHARGE TWO SPACES APIECE. SO THE PLANS BEFORE YOU DO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS.
01:24:25.541: >> CHAIR MILLS: CAN STAFF CLARIFY THEN WHAT THE NOTATION IS? OR HOW THAT WORKS WITH THE SECOND CONDITION THEN? IF THEY ARE SHOWN. I DIDN'T ZOOM IN WELL ENOUGH.
01:24:52.234: >> MR. KOWALSKI: THE PLAN WERE MODIFIED ACCORDINGLY BASED ON ZBA ACTION AND THAT WOULD NOT NECESSITATE ANOTHER PLANNING COMMISSION REVIEW IF APPROVED TONIGHT. WHATEVER THE ZBA GRANTS, THE PLANS CAN BE AMENDED TO FIX THAT.
01:25:16.925: >> CHAIR MILLS: BECAUSE THERE WAS SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT WHETHER PREFERRED LOCATION FOR SOME OF THE CHARGES IS AND BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE -- THE PETITIONER SHARE THAT SITE PLAN SHOWING THOSE LOCATIONS?
01:25:34.576: >> SURE.
01:25:35.944: >> I'LL DO IT.
01:25:40.349: >> OKAY.
01:25:42.951: >> CHAIR MILLS: AND COMMISSIONER DISCH I SEE YOUR HAND.
01:26:03.638: >> THEY ARE IN THIS LOCATION, RIGHT?
01:26:08.710: >> POINT NORTH OF YOUR CURSOR FOR ONE ADA ACCESSIBLE.
01:26:15.517: >> THERE IS ONE HERE. THERE ARE 22 HERE. FOR A TOTAL OF 23.
01:26:21.923: >> CHAIR MILLS: SO WHAT IS REQUIRED THOUGH IS 23 INSTALLED, 23 READY AND 34 CAPABLE. SO ARE THOSE READY AND CAPABLE ALSO SHOWN?
01:26:43.011: >> SO THE CODE DEFINES FOR BOTH READY AND CAPABLE AS A PANEL REQUIREMENT FOR INTERNAL ELECTRICAL. SO WE NOTE THAT THOSE WOULD BE CAPABLE. AND BE READY. BUT THOSE ARE NOT THE NOTED AS SPECIFIC SPACES. THAT WILL BE FLEXIBLE POSITIONING WERE WE TO INSTALL ANY ADDITIONAL SPACES. WE HAVE NOT DESIGNATED FOR SPECIFIC SPACES AT THIS TIME.
01:27:10.172: >> CHAIR MILLS: I THINK CAPABLE AND READY PARTICULARLY WHEN IT IS A SURFACE PARKING LOT INCLUDES THE RACEWAY AS WELL. IT IS NOT JUST THE PANEL.
01:27:24.319: >> YEAH I CAN CLARIFY THAT.
01:27:25.187: >> MR. LENART: THE EV INSTALLED AS A CHARGER, EV-READY AS THE LINES INSTALLED AND EV-CAPABLE HAS A RACEWAY AND CAPACITY.
01:27:42.937: >> CHAIR MILLS: I APPRECIATE HAVING THE 23 HERE AND SHOWN; AND BASED ON THE CONVERSATION WITH COLLEAGUES EARLIER, THIS IS FUTURE PROOFING PARTIALLY WHAT YOU ARE BUILDING BUT IT DOES NOT GET TO THAT NUMBER THAT IS CURRENTLY IN THERE. SO WHAT I AM HEARING TOO IS THAT SOME ADDITIONAL THINGS WE NEED TO HAPPEN TO BE SHOWN ON THE PLANS. THAT IS WHY THE SECOND CONDITION IS ON THERE. GO AHEAD. THE PETITIONER WANTS TO GO AND THEN COMMISSIONER DISCH.
01:28:28.984: >> WE ARE SHOWING THE 23 THAT HAVE TO BE INSTALLED. THE OTHER 23 AND 34 I BELIEVE ARE LISTED ON THE COVER SHEET AS BEING PROPOSED. BUT THOSE IMPROVEMENTS LIKE THE RACEWAYS AND CONDUITS AND THE UPGRADED PANELS THOSE THINGS ARE NOT GOOD TO BE DEVELOPED UNTIL WE DO DETAILED DESIGN PLANS. THERE IS NO WAY TO SHOW ON THE SITE PLAN OTHER THAN TO NOTE IT ON THE COVER SHEET. I FEEL LIKE THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE PLAN WAS TO MEET THE ORDINANCE. AND AT THE MEETING TOMORROW WITH THE ZBA IS TO REQUEST A VARIANCE AND IF WE DO NOT GET THEIR VARIANCE WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO GO BACK AND MEET THE INTENT OF THE ORDINANCE.
01:29:12.827: >> CHAIR MILLS: COMMISSIONER DISCH?
01:29:14.696: >> COMMISSIONER DISCH: I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON COMMISSIONER SAUVE'S SUGGESTION. I KNOW YOU HAVE A PROPOSED CYBER CONNECTION THAT YOU SHARE WITH THE NATURE AREA BUT THAT IS NOT GOING TO BE IN YOUR PARKING LOT. SO IN ORDER TO -- I DON'T KNOW, CAN EV-CAPABLE REINSTALLED WITHOUT RIPPING UP THAT EXISTING PARKING LOT? SINCE THERE IS GOING TO BE A PROPOSED SIDEWALK EXTENSION? YEAH LISA, YOU SUGGESTED IT SO YOU CAN ANSWER IT.
01:29:52.400: >> COMMISSIONER SAUVE: EVEN RUNNING THE CONDUIT UNDER THE SIDEWALK THERE WILL BE SOME INTERACTION THAT WILL REQUIRE MORE INVASIVE CONSTRUCTION. BUT ALONG THE SIDEWALK THERE WILL BE LANDSCAPE AREAS IT WOULD BE IDEAL ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE PARKING LOT TO PLUG THEM IN AS A POSSIBILITY, GETTING TO THE NORTH SIDE YOU HAVE TO WRAP AROUND THE PARKING NOT, AND HAVE ALL OF THOSE STUBS UP. AGAIN THIS IS ME THINKING OUT LOUD, NOT SOMETHING THAT I AM VERY FIXED TO. BUT WHEN WITH ICHABOD SUNDAY VERSUS THE REST OF THE WEEK AND WHO COULD USE THESE, THE COMMUNITY KNOWS THAT THESE ARE "COMMUNITY" PARKING SPACES INSTEAD OF "CHURCH" PARKING SPACES, SAYS A LOT ABOUT WHO CAN UTILIZE THIS MORE OFTEN AND GET A BANG FOR YOUR BUCK IN TERMS OF PUTTING THEM IN.
01:30:55.129: >> COMMISSIONER DISCH: I AM 100% IN FAVOR OF THE SUGGESTION I WAS NOT AWARE OF THAT BECAUSE YOUR DAY JOB IS MUCH MORE DIFFERENT THAN MINE. IT IS EXPENSIVE AND SO IT SHOULD BE A SHAREABLE AS IT POSSIBLY COULD BE.
01:31:17.419: >> CHAIR MILLS: ANY OTHER COMMENTS? I'M STILL OF THE MIND THAT IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S NOT -- I'M NOT COMFORTABLE WITH WHERE THE PLAN IS IN TERMS OF MOVING FORWARD. NOT HAVING THOSE DETAILS SHOWN HERE. I'M NOT COMFORTABLE SUPPORTING THIS.
01:31:48.583: >> COMMISSIONER WYCHE: IS IT CORRECT THAT WE WOULD NOT SHOW THIS IN THE PLANS BUT ONLY UNDERCOVER LETTER?
01:32:06.802: >> MR. LENART: WE HAVE APPROVED OTHER PLANS THAT HAVE NOTED THE SPACES BUT NOT LOCATE THEM ON THE PLAN AND I DO THINK THAT THE LOCATION OF THE CHARGING INSTALLED IS THE MOST CRITICAL. IF THAT IS INFORMATION FOR THE COMMISSION THAT IS SOMETHING THAT CAN BE ASKED.
01:32:29.157: >> COMMISSIONER WYCHE: THANK YOU.
01:32:30.091: >> CHAIR MILLS: ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS? MR. LENART I THINK WE CAN VOTE.
01:32:54.549: >> CHAIR MILLS: SNUCK IN BEFORE!
01:32:58.386: >> COMMISSIONER WYCHE; JUST IN TERMS OF WHAT MR. LENART SAID AROUND IF YOU WANT TO MAKE A COMMUNICATION TO THE ZBA WE HAVE TO TAKE OFFICIAL ACTION SO I DIDN'T KNOW THAT NEEDED TO PRECEDE THE ACTION ON THE SITE PLAN. SO -- WE CAN EITHER APPROVE OR REJECT THIS? IF WE REJECT THIS WE DO NOT NEED TO SEND A NOTE TO THE ZBA BECAUSE THAT WOULD FORCE THE PETITIONER TO DURATION OF SOME SORTS. I WANT TO UNDERSTAND THE ORDER OF THINGS.
01:33:34.121: >> CHAIR MILLS: AND ONE OF THE COMMUNICATIONS -- PEOPLE HAVE BEEN BRAINSTORMING OUT LOUD TODAY SO I AM GOING TO THINK OUT LOUD TOO. WOULD IT BE APPROPRIATE MR. LENART IN THAT CONDITION TO SAY IN THE SECOND CONDITION OF THE NUMBER OF EV PARKING SPACES REQUIRED IF ANY VARIANCES GRANTED BY THE ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS SO LONG AS THAT NUMBER EXCEEDS 38 SPACES? LIKE THAT'S IN MY MIND THE MINIMUM. THAT IS WHAT I WANT TO COMMUNICATTO THEM.  SHOULD IT BE A SEPARATE COMMUNICATION?
01:34:34.815: >> MR. LENART: IT IS NOT WITHIN THE PLANNING COMMISSIONS PURVIEW THAT IS A DECISION FOR THE ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS SO I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO INCLUDE THAT IN THE MOTION. BUT AGAIN IF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU WANT THAT INFORMATION, THAT DECISION PRIOR, YOU COULD WAIT UNTIL THAT ACTION OCCURS. BUT AGAIAT THAT POINT I IN THE RESU HAPPED. 'SEITHER GRANTED OR NOT. AND IF ANY VARIANCE IS GRANTED, THEN A PLAN WOULD BE PRESENTED BACK TO YOU COMPLAINT WITH THAT.
01:35:22.397: >> CHAIR MILLS: GOT IT. VICE-CHAIR GIBB-RANDAL?
01:35:30.939: >> COUNCILMEMBER GIBB-RANDAL: SO IF WE ARE VOTING FOR THIS -- IS IT FOR THE LOWER NUMBER?
01:35:36.411: >> MR. LENART: WHAT WE INTEND TO DO WITH YOUR MOTION IS TO COMMUNICATE THAT THE SITE PLAN HAS TO INCLUDE ALL THE REQUIRED EV PARKING. IT IS NOTED ON THE PLAN, UNLESS A VARIANCE IS GRANTED. AND THAT IT HAS TO REFLECT THAT. YOU COULD APPROVE SITE PLAN AND THE PETITIONER COULD RECEIVE A VARIANCE ON THAT AND I COULD PROCEED TO CITY COUNCIL ALTERED FROM WHAT YOU DID BUT STILL FULLY COMPLIANT WITH THE ORDINANCE BECAUSE OF THE GRANTING OF THE VARIANCE. I THINK THAT COMMUNICATION IS THE MOST APPROPRIATE. AGAIN, I WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU CONSIDER TO SOME EXTENT IT'S THEIR PROCESS, THEY'RE A BOARD TRYING TO APPLY THE SAME STANDARDS THAT YOU ARE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE OUTCOME IS BUT AGAIN AS I HAVE INDICATED I THINK THIS IS A PRETTY DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCE THAN THE PRIOR ONE.
01:36:47.816: >> CHAIR MILLS: OKAY, THAT IS HELPFUL FOR ME. TO BE CLEAR THEY COULD'VE NOT TOLD US, THE COULD HAVE NOT BROUGHT THIS INFORMATION THAT THEY WERE GOING TO SEEK A VARIANCE TO US.
01:37:00.161: >> MR. LENART: AND THE PLAN THAT YOU SEE REFLECTS THAT.
01:37:06.600: >> CHAIR MILLS: YES. THAT CHANGES MY MIND AND THIS OTHER THAN TO SAY THAT I WILL LET MY KIDS STAY UP WAY PAST THEIR BEDTIME SO WE CAN VOTE ON THAT COMMUNICATION BECAUSE I THINK THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT. COMMISSIONER WYCHE?
01:37:24.986: >> COMMISSIONER WYCHE: THE THING THAT IS CONFUSING MR. LENART IS AT ONCE HE GETS TO COUNCIL FOR FINAL APPROVAL THE NOTATION TO COUNCIL SHOWS THE VOTE OF THE PLANNING COMMISSION WITH THE DISCUSSION THAT WE HAVE HAD. WHEN THEY RECEIVE IT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF COMMISSIONER DISCH WHO IS THERE TO SPEAK ALTHOUGH I DON'T THINK SHE IS PERMITTED TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE PLANNING COMMISSION SO IT IS ABSENT OF THIS 1HR. AND 42-MIN. CONVERSATION. IF IT APPEARS AS IF WE DID NOT ACTUALLY HAVE THIS CONVERSATION AROUND THIS SORT OF PEACE AND SO I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW THAT IS COMMUNICATED IN THE BEST POSSIBLE WAY SO THAT COUNCIL ISN'T JUST SEEING THIS AND SAY WELL THE PLANNING COMMISSION VOTED UNANIMOUSLY TO ACCEPT THIS, AND WE AGREED NOT TO CHANGE ANYTHING AND WE HAD THIS ROBUST CONVERSATION. BUT THERE IS A BOARD IN THE WAY AND WE CANNOT TELL THEM WHAT THEY DO AND COUNCIL HAS SAID THEY DO NOT WANT THE PLANNING COMMISSION SO THEY ARE NOT AWARE EXCEPT FOR COMMISSIONER DISCH WHO IS HERE. AND AGAIN I AM SAYING THIS OUT LOUD TO TRY TO HELP MOVE US ALONG SO THAT WE CAN GET TO THE THING THAT I THINK WE WANT TO DO WHICH IS TO COMMUNICATE THAT THIS IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE THIS IS A NEWLY CONSTRUCTED PARKING LOT VERSUS JUST A SITE CHANGING THE EXISTING FOOTPRINT AND WE DON'T WANT TO MAKE IT ONEROUS ON THEM JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE CHANGING THE EXISTING FOOTPRINT. WE WANT TO SAY, THIS IS A 100 YEAR DEVELOPMENT, IT IS A SPECIAL USE TO START WITH, A CHURCH. IT IS EITHER A CHURCH, A DAY CARE CENTER OR SCHOOL OR IT WILL GET TORN DOWN AND REBUILT SO WE WANT TO TRY TO PUT SOME OF THIS INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE WHEN WE HAVE OPPORTUNITY. AND THAT IS IT.
01:39:49.363: >> MR. LENART: I'M GOING TO START WITH SOMETHING THAT IS FRUSTRATING I AM SURE TO ALL OF YOU. THAT DISCUSSION DOESN'T MATTER. COMMUNICATING THAT TO THE CITY COUNCIL DOESN'T REALLY MATTER A WHOLE LOT BECAUSE YOUR TASK HERE IS TO DETERMINE IF THE SITE PLAN MEETS THE ORDINANCE OF THE CITY. THE CITY COUNCIL HAS THE SAME JOB, TO DETERMINE IF THE SITE PLAN MEETS THE ORDINANCE OF THE CITY. NEITHER GROUP HAS THE ABILITY TO ADD REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE NOT HOUSED IN THAT. THE ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS PROCESS AS PART OF THAT PROCESS. AND THAT IS WHY I THINK EDUCATION IS APPROPRIATE AND YOU CAN SHARE THAT. BUT THE PROCESS THAT YOU APPLY AS TO WHETHER THE SITE MEETS THE UBC REQUIREMENTS IN THE PROCESS OF THE ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS APPLIES TO TO WHETHER OR NOT A VARIANCE IS OR IS NOT APPROPRIATE LAYOUT THE RULES BY WHICH THIS WILL BE MEASURED AGAINST. AND SO I WOULD SAY THAT PROBABLY THE MORE IMPORTANT THING TO COMMUNICATE TO COUNCIL WOULD BE IF BY ORDINANCE ACTION -- IF THIS ORDINANCE IS NOT DOING WHAT YOU WANT IT TO, THEN WE SHOULD CHANGE IT. SO, I DON'T MEAN TO BELITTLE; I THINK YOU ARE WRESTLING WITH THE ISSUE BUT YOU ARE WRESTLING WITH THOSE CONSTRAINTS. SIMILAR TO WHAT WE DISCUSSED IN THE WORKING SESSION. OUR GOALS ARE BROAD. OUR TASK IS MORE FOCUSED ON THE ORDINANCE. SORRY, THAT WAS A REAL DOWNER APPARENTLY.
01:41:37.672: >> CHAIR MILLS: COMMISSIONER SAUVE?
01:41:41.442: >> COMMISSIONER SAUVE: I WILL BE MORE OF A DOWNER; I WILL NOT SUPPORT A PRECEDENT THAT WE ARE ISSUING COMMUNICATION WITH EVERY VOTE AND  THIS IS NOT SEE VERY FAR OFF OF ANY OTHER MOTION WE MAKE SO I WOULD NOT SUPPORT THAT AT ALL.
01:42:01.996: >> CHAIR MILLS: WHAT I WANT TO HAVE THAT DISCUSSION ABOUT COMMUNICATIONS NOW. COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDAL.
01:42:18.880: >> COUNCILMEMBER GIBB-RANDAL: I SEE THE NUMBER OF SPACES THAT WE WANT ON THE COVER SHEET IN THE CHURCH. WHAT DO WE DO WITH THAT IF WE ARE VOTING ON THIS PLAN SET WHETHER OR NOT WE ARE GOING FOR VARIANCE?
01:42:36.831: >> CHAIR MILLS: GIVEN THE STAFF REPORT THAT IS THE SAME.
01:42:39.834: >> MR. LENART: FIRST OF ALL MY APOLOGIES. I WAS NOT AWARE THAT THE SITE PLAN WAS INCLUDED. I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT THE SITE PLAN REFLECTED THOSE KINDS OF PLACES, I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT BUT WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT I THINK EMOTION IS FINE AS IT IS; IT IDENTIFIES THAT YOU HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THE (INDISCERNIBLE) AND FRANKLY ADDING THE ADDITION (INDISCERNIBLE) -- BUDGET COULD STRIKE THOSE CONDITIONS AND SIMPLY OMIT IT AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT YOU WOULD BE APPROVING THE SITE PLAN IS FULLY COMPLIANT, AND THEY COULD PROCEED TO THE ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS AND THEY COULD BE DENIED AND THE SITE PLAN WOULD GO FORWARD TO THE CITY COUNCIL IN ITS CURRENT FORM AND THEY COULD GO TO THE ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS AND IT COULD BE GRANTED AND THE SITE PLAN COULD BE MODIFIED TO REFLECT 10 EV SPACES AS AN EXAMPLE AND THAT WOULD PROCEED TO CITY COUNCIL FULLY COMPLIANT.
01:43:45.699: >> COUNCILMEMBER GIBB-RANDAL: SO THE FACT THAT THEY SHOW IT ON THE PLAN SET MEANS THAT THE COMPLIANCE.
01:44:01.715: >> MR. LENART: MY APOLOGIES, MAYBE WE MADE IT WORSE. WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME TO PRESENT OUR CONSIDERATION AND I FELT LIKE THE LAST PROJECT WE CONSIDERED SEEMED TO BE A BIG TOPIC. WHAT IS THE RIGHT/WRONG/APPROPRIATE WAY WHEN WE ARE EXPANDING PARKING AREAS? THAT PROJECT IS SEEKING A VARIANCE AS WELL. I THINK ALL THREE OF THEM ARE ACTUALLY PRETTY DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES. BUT, OUR INTENTION WAS TO BE FORTHRIGHT WITH THE COMMISSION. STAFF'S PERSPECTIVE IS THAT THEY CAN PROVIDE THEM. AND THAT IS WHY WE INCLUDED IT.
01:44:54.301: >> COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDAL: I WOULD SAY THAT IS A MESSAGE TO FUTURE PETITIONERS,  IF YOUR INTENT IS TO ASK FOR A VARIANCE SHOW IT IN THE PLANT BECAUSE IT IS CONFUSING THE ISSUE TO HAVE IT BE KIND OF LIKE -- IT'S LIKE TRYING TO DO IT BOTH WAYS WHICH SEEMS DISINGENUOUS TO ME. COMMIT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. IF NOT THAT IS A RISK-TAKING THAT IS PART OF WHAT IS MAKING THIS KIND OF MORE MUDDY AND CONFUSING.
01:45:27.701: >> MR. LENART: AND AS MUCH TO US TRY TO FIGURE OUT THE BEST WAY TO COMMUNICATE WHEN THIS ARISES SO WE CAN FOLLOW THE DIRECTION IF THAT SEEMS TO RESONATE WITH THE COMMISSION.
01:45:44.885: >> CHAIR MILLS:
01:45:47.955: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT: CAN THE ZBA SAY WE DON'T ACCEPT THE TIME, CAN THEY DELIBERATE AND COME UP WITH A DIFFERENT NUMBER AND COME BACK TO US?
01:46:12.379: >> MR. LENART: IT IS A LITTLE LESS DELIBERATION THAN THE PLANNING COMMISSION BUT YES THE COMMISSION CAN MODIFY THE APPLICATION BASED ON THE FEEDBACK I RECEIVED FROM THE ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS AND OUR PARKING VARIANCE HAS DIFFERENT STANDARDS THAN THE TYPICAL VARIANCE, LESS ROBUST. THAT CAN HAPPEN. SOMETIMES THE PETITIONER WILL FRANKLY LEAE THE ROOM AND SINCE THE DATE MAY BE A BIT FAR AFIELD OF WHAT THE ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS THINKS IS APPROPRIATE AND THEY MAY MODIFY THEIR PROPOSAL, BUT THE VAST MAJORITY  TEND TO BE UP OR DOWN VOTE AT THE MEETING.
01:47:01.362: >> THANKS.
01:47:02.062: >> CHAIR MILLS: OTHER QUESTIONS BEFORE WE VOTE?
01:47:25.185: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT: YES.
01:47:32.126: >> S.MMISSIONER LEE?
01:47:37.798: >> COMSSIONER HAMMSCHMIDT: YES.
01:47:40.234: >> COMMISSIONER CLARKE: YES.
01:47:44.538: >> COMMISSIONER WYCHE: YES.
01:47:49.977: >> CHAIR MILLS: YES.
01:48:00.788: >> COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDAL
01:48:06.827: >> YES.
01:48:08.495: >> MR. LENART: MOTION CARRIES UNANIMOUSLY.
01:48:17.771: >> CHAIR MILLS: ITEM 10, PUBLIC COMMENT YOU CAN CALL 877-853-5247 AND ENTER MEETING ID 977 6634 1226. CITY STAFF WILL SELECT COLORS THAT HAVE RAISED THEIR HAND. IF YOU'RE CALLING IN PRESS*NINE ON THE PHONE AND THE PEOPLE HAVE JOINED THROUGH ZOOM YOU CAN USE THE RAISE HAND FUNCTION AND MR. LENART WILL SELECT CALLERS EITHER BY THE LAST THREE DIGITS OF YOUR PHONE OR BY YOUR NAME AND YOU WILL HEAR A RECORDED VOICE ACKNOWLEDGING THAT YOU HAVE BEEN GRANTED PERMISSION TO SPEAK, PLEASE MOVE TO A QUIET PLACE TO MUTE THE BACKGROUND. AGAIN IF YOU WANT TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENTS AND HAVE JOINED US THROUGH ZOOM USE THE RAISE HAND FEATURE WHICH SHOULD BE IN THE CENTER OF YOUR SCREEN UNDERNEATH OUR PICTURES.
01:49:27.207: >>
01:49:29.309: >> CHAIR MILLS: ALRIGHT, SEEING NO HANDS. I WILL MOVE ON TO ITEM 12 WHICH IS COMMISSION PROPOSED BUSINESS. IS THERE ANY? COMMISSIONER SAUVE?
01:49:47.161: >> COMMISSIONER SAUVE: I WOULD LIKE TO LOOK AT THE PARKING ORDINANCE ONCE WE GET INTO IT LIKE THE IDEA OF GRAVEL LOT -- SEEMS TO BE AN INTERESTING OPTION, FOR SOMETHING WE USE ONLY ONE DAY A WEEK AND WHAT OVERFLOW PARKING MIGHT LOOK LIKE IN OTHER COMPARABLE CITIES VERSUS JUST ONE TYPE OF PARKING. SO KIND OF ADDING THAT AS A SUB-BULLET TO THE PARKING DISCUSSION THAT MIGHT BE COMING UP.
01:50:22.095: >> CHAIR MILLS: I WOULD ALSO PROPOSE THAT WE MARK THIS IN OUR WORK PLAN AND THE PARKING DISCUSSION AS YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE THAT THE EV ORDINANCE HAS TO CHANGE. IF YOU ARE REQUIRED TO BUILD 300 SPOTS AND YOU BUILD 600 YOU HAVE THE SAME EV PARKING REQUIREMENTS AND THAT IS WRONG, IT SHOULD BE REVERSED IN MY MIND. --- SO I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SURE-- AND THIS IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF WHERE THAT COMES TO BE. I KNOW THAT THERE WAS DISCUSSION ON THIS BEFORE. I WOULD LIKE TO PROPOSE THAT WE DO SEND A COMMUNICATION THAT ACTUALLY GOES TO ZBA AND TO COUNCIL HIGHLIGHTING THE ISSUES WE ARE SEEING ON THE EV ORDINANCE AND SOME OF THE DISCUSSION WHICH IS ABOUT BUILDING FUTURE PROOFING ANY NEW WORKING WE ARE ADDING TO THE CITY.
01:51:35.769: >> MR. LENART: DO YOU WANT TO SEND A COMMUNICATION OR SEND A MODIFICATION?
01:51:40.774: >> CHAIR MILLS: I THINK IN MY MIND, GIVEN THE TIMELINESS OF THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE, I WOULD LIKE TO SEND A COMMUNICATION SAYING THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS COME UP NOW, MULTIPLE TIMES MAYBE NOT IN A ROW. BUT THAT WE ARE SEEING THAT WE ARE ANTICIPATING WORKING ON PROPOSING CHANGES TO THE EV ORDINANCE BUT IN THE MEANTIME SHOULD THERE BE VARIANCES SOUGHT OUR APPROACH SHOULD BE ABOUT FUTURE PROOFING, BUT IF YOU'RE BUILDING SOMETHING NEW THE MULTIPLIERS ARE TO APPLY TO WHAT IS NEW. --- MY SENSE WAS THAT THAT IDEA OF THE MULTIPLIER AT LEAST APPLYING TO THE NEW PARKING WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS SHARED. SO THAT IS WHAT IN MY MIND WOULD GO INTO THE COMMUNICATION NOT TELLING ZBA WHAT TO DO BUT THE RATIONALE BEHIND IT AND LETTING THEM KNOW WE ARE LOOKING AT IT BUT IN THE MEANTIME WE KNOW HOW LONG IT TAKES FOR ORDINANCE REVISIONS TO HAPPEN, AND WHO KNOWS HOW MANY VARIANCES COULD GO TO ZBA IN THE INTERIM. COMMISSIONER DISCH?
01:52:57.517: >> COMMISSIONER DISCH: I AM A TINY BIT PUZZLED IN THAT -- SO IN THE PREVIOUS ONE THAT WE TALKED ABOUT, THE INFILL HOUSING, WE DID TALK ABOUT APPLYING THE EV ORDINANCE TO THE PARKING THAT WAS NEW AND IN THIS CASE WE WANT THE CALCULATION OF THE EV ORDINANCE TO BE ON THE TOTAL MINIMUM, THE REQUIRED MINIMUM NUMBER OF SPOTS. WE DON'T WANT IT TO BE UNJUST WHAT IS NEW. YOU ARE SPECIFYING THAT BECAUSE THEY HAVE ASKED FOR A VARIANCE THAT IS CONSIDERABLY LOWER. IF WE SAY THAT WE COULD POTENTIALLY GET LESS THAN WHAT WE THINK IS APPROPRIATE FOR THIS PROJECT GIVEN THAT IT IS ALREADY OVER PROVIDING PARKING AND OUR FEELING IS, YOU SHOULD -- AND THERE'S THIS PUBLIC ACCESS PARKING LOT. OUR THINKING IS THAT MORE IS ACTUALLY APPROPRIATE HERE. IT'S A COMPLEX MUCH LIKE THE OTHER ONE THAT WE LOOKED AT, AND I WORRY THAT COMMUNICATION LEGITIMATES LESS THEN WHAT WE WANT ALTHOUGH IT REQUIRES MORE THAN THEY ARE ASKING FOR.
01:54:31.445: >> CHAIR MILLS: YEAH I SEE THAT. I MEAN, WE DON'T HAVE TO SEND ANYTHING AND TO COMMISSIONER SAUVE'S POINT EARLIER, I DON'T LIKE THE IDEA OF SENDING COMMUNICATIONS BUT WE HAVE HAD A ROBUST DISCUSSION A COUPLE WEEKS NOW AND UNTIL OUR ORDINANCE REFLECTS THAT AND DEALS WITH ALL OF THESE POTENTIAL DIFFERENT WAYS OF THINKING ABOUT THAT MULTIPLIER, I DON'T THINK THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE THE ONLY VARIANCE THAT HAPPENS AND WE MAY WELL NOT KNOW ABOUT IT. MR. LENART?
01:55:12.186: >> MR. LENART: I AGREE WITH YOU. I THINK WE WILL HAVE MORE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT IT. BUT BY THE SAME TOKEN, I THINK IN SHORT ORDER HERE WE ARE GOING TO HAVE RESULTS ON THREE VARIANCE APPLICATIONS FOR THREE PRETTY DIFFERENT PROJECTS IN THAT REGARD. AND SO, I DO THINK THE EV ORDINANCE -- YOU ARE SEEING THESE VARIANCE APPLICATIONS BECAUSE IT IS AN IMPACTFUL AND COSTLY ADD-ON TO DEVELOPMENT IN THE CITY. I GUESS I DON'T HAVE A CRYSTAL BALL WHERE WE WILL END UP. BUT I DO THINK THAT GIVING SPACE FOR THESE DECISIONS TO COME OUT TO SEE HOW THE END OF ALL THE DIFFERENT SCENARIOS WOULD PROBABLY HELP US IN THAT WORK GOING FORWARD ABOUT HOW WE WANT TO ADJUST THAT ORDINANCE TO MAYBE GET CLOSER TO THE RIGHT BALANCE OF WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR. --- LIKE I WOULD -- IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES-- IN THE FIRST ONE, THAT IS NOT WHAT I ENVISIONED AS THE INTENT OF THE EV ORDINANCE. THE INTENT I THOUGHT WAS WHEN WE ARE BUILDING PARKING LET'S MAKE SURE WE ARE FUTURE PROOFING IT FOR THIS BENEFIT AND NO PARKING IS BEING BUILT THERE BUT IT WAS A REQUIREMENT. --- AND THIS ONE IS ANOTHER EXTREME. BUILDING ENOUGH PARKING TO WHERE MEETING THAT REQUIREMENT CAN BE MET. MAYBE IT IS OKAY TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE ARE PROBABLY GOING TO SEE OTHER SCENARIOS AMONG THOSE THREE. LET'S ALSO SEE WHAT HAPPENS WITH THESE APPLICATIONS TO SEE IF THEY ARE CONSIDERED OR ENACTED BY THE BOARD AND THEN WITH THE BENEFIT OF THAT WE ARE MOVING THE BALL FORWARD. I THINK WHAT WE ARE STRUGGLING WITH IS HOW QUICKLY ARE WE GOING TO MOVE THE BALL FORWARD TOWARDS THIS INFRASTRUCTURE. I DON'T THINK THAT WAITING TO SEE THESE EARLY REACTIONS AND RESPONSES AND THE DELIBERATIONS BY BOTH YOU AND THE ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS -- MAYBE THAT IS A SMALL TWO CENTS AS TO HOW TO SHY AWAY FROM A COMMUNICATION TO LET THE PROCESS WORK IN THE WAY THAT OUR INSTRUCTIONS WERE INTENDED, AND THEN LET'S SEE WHERE WE END UP.
01:57:53.212: >> CHAIR MILLS: I CONSIDER THAT A FRIENDLY AMENDMENT TO INSTEAD HAVING THE PLANNING MANAGER REPORT BACK AFTER ZBA. WE ARE NOT GOING TO CHANGE THINGS OVERNIGHT ANYWAY. I WILL TAKE THAT, THAT IS OKAY.
01:58:12.699: >> MR. LENART: I FEEL LIKE I'M FRUSTRATINGLY PLANNING COMMISSION ALL THE TIME. I AM SORRY.
01:58:20.006: >> CHAIR MILLS: I SINCERELY APPRECIATE ALL OF THE EXPERTISE THAT YOU BRING TO OUR COMMISSION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR GUIDING US.
01:58:27.848: >> MR. LENART: LIKE A DOWNER.
01:58:30.984: >> CHAIR MILLS: ALL RIGHT ANY OTHERS? THEN WE ARE ON TO ITEM 12 WHICH IS ADJOURNMENT. MOVED BY COMMISSIONER LEE, SECOND BY COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT. ALL OF THOSE IN FAVOR? RAISE YOUR HANDS. UNANIMOUS. HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.
01:58:53.406: >> [END OF MEETING]
