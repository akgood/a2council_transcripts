00:00:39.985: >> THANK YOU, MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL. I WANT TO INTRODUCE MY PANEL OF COWORKERS WHO ARE HERE TO DO THE PRESENTATION WITH ME. WE HAVE MAURA THOMPSON WITH THE D.D.A. WE HAVE FORREST YANG WITH THE A.A.A.T.A., ALEX HUFF AND MICHAEL JOHNSON ARE HERE WITH THE SMITH GROUP AND WE MAY BE JOINED BY EITHER DEREK DELACOURT OR BRENT LENART. THE REASON WE HAVE A WIDE SPECTRUM OF PEOPLE PARTICIPATING IS THAT THIS IS REALLY AND SHOWCASE IN THE COLLABORATION WITH OTHER PUBLIC ENTITIES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ADDRESSING EACH OF OUR VARIOUS PUBLIC GOALS AND THE NEEDS THE COMMUNITY AROUND TRANSPORTATION, PEOPLE-FRIENDLY STREETS, PLANNING, AND SUSTAINABILITY AS WELL AS AFFORDABLE HOUSING. OH, THERE'S DEREK. AND WE CAN GO AHEAD AND IF MICHAEL WANTS TO SHARE HIS SCREEN, WE'LL START WITH THAT. AND WE'RE GOING TO START WITH TALKING ABOUT AN UPDATE ON WHERE WE'RE AT WITH 350 SOUTH FIFTH AND THEN WE'LL GO INTO A DISCUSSION OF THE MOST RECENT FOR COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT SITES ON CATHERINE, MAIN STREET, 721 NORTH MAIN, 353 SOUTH MAIN, AS WELL AS ASHLEY STREET. OKAY. GO AHEAD. AND I'M JUST GOING TO GIVE A REFRESHER BACKGROUND. MOSTLY FOR THE PUBLIC WHO WAY BE WATCHING. OUR GOAL FROM THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING PERSPECTIVE TO ENSURE THAT AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE ARE ABLE TO ACCESS AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHETHER THAT'S RENTAL OR HOMEOWNERSHIP OR CO-OP, AND THE DEFINITION THAT WE GENERALLY USE IN OUR AREA IS THAT IF YOU ARE SPENDING MORE THAN 30% OF YOUR GROSS HOUSEHOLD INCOME ON HOUSING, THEN IT'S -- CONSIDERED TOO EXPENSIVE FOR WHAT THE GOAL IS. AND THERE'S A NEW DEFINITION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION TRANSPORTATION. SO IF YOU ARE SPENDING MORE THAN 45% OF YOUR GROSS HOUSEHOLD INCOME ON BOTH HOUSING AND TRANSPORTATION, THEN THAT IS CONSIDERED A COST BURDEN AS WELL, WHICH IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU HAVE A COMMUNITY LIKE ANN ARBOR THAT GETS INCREASINGLY EXPENSIVE AND THEN PEOPLE MOVE FARTHER AND FARTHER AWAY AND SO YOUR TRANSPORTATION COSTS INCREASE AS YOU ARE FINDING MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THAT'S WHY WE LOOK AT BOTH OF THEM COMBINED. THIS YEAR. THE MEDIAN FAMILY INCOME AS PUBLISHED BY H.U.D. INCREASED BY A LITTLE OVER $5,000 OVER LAST YEAR WHICH IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT JUMP. SO THE CURRENT MEDIAN FAMILY INCOME IS 126,600 WHICH MEANS HALF ARE BELOW OR HALF ARE ABOVE THAT IN THE COMMUNITY. AND HAVE YOU PROBABLY SEEN THIS CHART MANY TIMES UPDATED FOR THIS YEAR. WHAT HAPPENS IS H.U.D. PLACES THAT MEDIAN INCOME FOR THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY INTO A HOUSEHOLD OF FOUR AT MEDIAN. AND THEN EVERY OTHER POSITION ON THIS CHART IS REALLY A FORMULA. AND SO IT'S JUST A -- IF YOU GO A LOWER HOUSEHOLD SIZE OR HIGHER HOUSEHOLD SIZE OR HIGHER INCOME OR LOWER INCOME, IT'S JUST A FORMULA THAT H.U.D. USES TO DETERMINE WHICH HOUSEHOLDS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR WHICH KINDS OF FUNDING AND THEN THE CITY USES THE SAME INFORMATION FOR ITS OWN PROGRAMS, FOR EXAMPLE, AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT'S REQUIRED THROUGH BROWNFIELD OR A PUD OR OR ANY KIND OF ZONING THA DEVELOPER PROVIDES AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND THEN IF YOU TRANSLATE THAT AND YOU SAY THAT INCOME AND YOU TRANSLATE IT INTO WHAT IS THAT AFFORDABLE HOUSING COST BASED ON YOUR GROSS INCOME, WE PULLED 60% OF AREA MEDIAN INCOME, BECAUSE THAT IS THE GOAL WITH CITY COUNCIL TO TRY TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF AFFORDABLE UNITS AT 60% MEDIAN OR LESS. IT'S NOT STRICTLY THAT EXACT NUMBER. IT'S THAT NUMBER OR ANYTHING LESS THAN THAT FOR THESE HOUSEHOLD SIZES. SO IF YOU TAKE THAT INFORMATION, AND YOU TRANSLATE IT INTO THE MAXIMUM AFFORDABLE HOUSING COST, YOU CAN SEE THAT RIGHT HERE, WHICH IS REALLY ACTUALLY SLIGHTLY BELOW THE AVERAGE APARTMENT COST IN THE COMMUNITY RIGHT NOW. SO AS INCOMES INCREASE REALLY QUICKLY, THE POOL OF ELIGIBILITY INCREASES THE PUT THE NUMBER OF REALLY LOW-INCOME DECREASES BECAUSE THERE'S NOT ENOUGH AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WHEN WE DOT PROJECTS THAT WE ARE -- DO THE PROJECTS THAT WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT WE ARE NOT EXACTLY TARGETING 60% AREA MEDIAN INCOME, WE WANT TO TARGET LOWER HOUSEHOLD INCOMES BUT THIS IS GENERALLY THE MAX OF WHAT OUR GOAL S. SO THE IMPACT ON THE COMMUNITY WITH MORE PEOPLE NOT BEING ABLE TO LIVE IN THE COMMUNITY, WOULD WORK IN THE COMMUNITY IS ABOUT 84,000 PEOPLE COMMUTE INTO THE CITY. THIS IS PRECOVID NUMBER. THOSE OUTSIDE OF THE CITY AND COMMUTE CITY. AND OVER 20,000 LIVE IN THE CITY AND COMMUTE OUTSIDE OF THE CITY FOR THEIR JOBS. WHICH HAS A BIG IMPACT NOT JUST ON THE PEOPLE WHO ARE HAVING TO COMMUTE AND IMPACT ON THEIR LIFE AND FAMILY SITUATION, BUT IT HAS A BIG IMPACT ON THE CITY'S INFRASTRUCTURE, THE ROADS, PARKING, YOU KNOW, ALL OF THOSE THINGS, POLICE, FIRE, ET CETERA, FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE COMING INTO THE CITY. SO ABOUT 2015, A STUDY WAS COMMISSIONED TO LOOK AT HOUSING AND ECONOMIC STABILITY IN VARIOUS COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY. AND WHAT THE RECORD RECOMMENDED WAS THAT THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR SHOULD TRY TO MEET A GOAL OF HAVING ABOUT 140 AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS BUILT ACQUIRED, PERMANENTLY, PERMANENTLY RESTRICTED FOR THE NEXT 20 YEARS FOR 60% A.M.I. HOUSEHOLDS. AND THAT EQUALS ABOUT 2800 STARTING IN 2015 AND WITH THE RECENT MILLAGE THAT WAS PASSED, PROPOSITION C IN NOVEMBER, THIS IS A GUESSTIMATE DEPENDING ON THE COMBINATION OF ACQUISITIONS VERSUS NEW CONSTRUCTION, AND DEPENDING ON HOW THE MARKET FLUCTUATES BUT WE BELIEVE THAT WOULD BE ENOUGH FUNDING OVER THE NEXT 20 YEARS STARTING IN 2021 TO ADD UP AT LEAST 1500 UNITS AFTER FORWARDABLE HOUSING. -- OF AFFORDABLE HOUSEHOLD HOU. AND THIS HAPPENS TO COINCIDE WITH THE WORK WE WERE ALREADY DOING IN LOOKING AT REDEVELOPING CITY-OWNED SITES THAT ARE WHAT WE CALL UNDERUTILIZED. IN OTHER WORDS IF THEY ARE A SURFACE PARKING LOT, FOR EXAMPLE OR AN AREA OF PUBLIC WORKS AREA THAT'S NO LONGER BEING FULLY UTILIZED BY THE CITY, COULD WE BUILD SOMETHING MORE FUNCTIONAL AND DO AFFORDABLE HOUSING ON THOSE SITES? AND SO THAT  LEADS US INTO OUR DISCUSSION OF THE FIRST SITE THAT WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT, WHICH IS 350 SOUTH 5th WHICH WE CALL THE FORMER Y LOT AND I WILL TURN THIS OVER TO MICHAEL, I'M ASSUMING, TO WALK US THROUGH WHERE WE ARE AT IN THE PROCESS AND WE REALLY WANT TO FOCUS ON A TALK ABOUT WHY 9 DESI DE -- WHYE DESIGN IS THE WAY IT IS AND WHY OUR COLLABORATION WITH THE D.D. D.D.A. AND THE A.A.A.T.A., AND THE DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT HAS REALLY HAD AN IMPACT ON HOW WE ARE DESIGNING THE BUILDING TO MAKE IT SOMETHING THAT IS MEETING MANY DIFFERENT PUBLIC NEEDS FROM THE PEOPLE-FRIENDLY STREETS TO TRANSIT, AS I SAID BEFORE, SUSTAINABILITY, ET CETERA. I WILL TURN IT OVER TO MICHAEL.
00:09:13.498: >> THANKS, JENNIFER. HI, EVERYONE, MICHAEL JOHNSON WITH SMITH GROUP, BASED HERE IN ANN ARBOR. AND, YES, EXCITED TO SHARE WITH YOU THE UPDATE ON OUR WORK AT 350 SOUTH FIFTH. JUST FOR KIND OF A CONTEXT PERSPECTIVE, THIS IS A CONTINUATION OF SOME OF THE PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT WORK THAT WE STARTED PRECOVID, LOOKING AT THIS SITE AND THE 415 WEST WASHINGTON SITE. USING THAT WORK REALLY AS A STARTING POINT FOR THE WORK AS IT CONTINUED AS IT RELATED TO URSDAY, THE 10th, FOUR DSOF AGO, WE HE A PUBC ENGAGEMENT SESSION FOR THE RESIDENTS CLOSEST TO THE LOT, THAT WAS KIND OF A FIRST STEP IN KICKING OFF A PUD PROCESS THAT WE HOPE TO HAVE SUBMITTED IN JULY. SO THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT TO YOU KIND OF AN IN-PROGRESS PIECE HERE OF, OF COURSE, BUILT ON THE PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT THAT STARTED YOU KNOW 18 OR SO MONTHS AGO AND THIS IS THE PREFERRED OPTION THAT 350 PLUS BOTH RESIDENTS AND, YOU KNOW, RESIDENTS AND BEYOND PARTICIPATED IN. WE HAD FOUR PUBLIC FOUR-HOUR WORK SESSIONS AT VARIOUS POINTS THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY AND THEN HAD ONLINE SURVEYS AS WELL, WHERE WE REALLY LOOKED AT DIFFERENT FORMS OF THE BUILDINGS AND THEN DIFFERENT TRADEOFFS AND/OR KIND OF SUCCESS METRICS AS YOU CAN SEE MEASURED ON THE FRONT THIS PREFERRED OPTION AS MEASURED BY THE PUBLIC WAS WITHIN ZONING, THE D.1 ZONING UP TO 900% OF FLOOR AREA RATIO AND IT WAS TARGETING 418 TOTAL UNITS, 31% OF WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN AFFORDABLE SO ABOUT 130 OF THOSE AT AFFORDABLE AND YOU WILL SEE HOW THIS KIND OF CONCEPT HAS A LOT OF SIMILARITIES BUT IT'S CONTINUED TO EVOLVE AS WE HAVE CONTINUED TO WORK WITH THE D.D.A. AND THE A.A.A.T.A. AND THE COMMUNITY OVER THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS, AND SO WHAT WHAT WE LOOKED AT FOR THE FIRST ENGAGEMENT EXERCISE WAS FOCUSING ON PER THE PUBLIC HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE AN OPTION FOR THE SITE THAT MAXIMIZES AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUT ALSO IMPROVES THE OPERATIONS OF THE LAKE TRANSIT CENTER. THE OTHER CRITERIA THAT WE HAVE UNCOVERED OVER THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS INCLUDED THE CONTINUED WORK WITH THE UTILITIES AND THE D.T.E. IS ON THIS SITE, AND THE LOADING REQUIREMENTS TO MAKE SURE THIS HAPPENS AT GRADE AND NOT BELOW GRADE. CONSIDERATIONS FOR WATT EXPANSION OF THE OPERATIONS -- WHAT THE EXPANSION FOR THE OPERATIONS OF BUS COULD BE AS IT RELATES TO ON-STREET TRANSIT. FEASIBILITY, WHILE THIS SITE AND THE OPTION THAT WE'RE NOT REQUIRING PARKING OR ENCOURAGING PARKING. IT LOOKS FOR THE OPTIONS SHOULD DEVELOPER PARTNER CONSIDER THAT AND THAT'S ONE THE CONSIDERATIONS THAT WE HAVE LOOKED AT IN ADDITION TO HOW ALL OF THIS LAYERS UP VERTICAL WITH THE VERTICAL CIRCULATION AND THE FEASIBILITY OF THE PROJECT. BUT I WOULD LIKE FOR US AS YOU TAKE A SIP OF WATER, MAYBE AT THIS POINT TO LET FORREST FROM THE A.A.A.T.A. TO CHIME IN HERE A LITTLE BIT TO HELP THE GROUP CONTINUE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS MEANS FOR THE A.A.A.T.A. AND THE LAKE TRANSIT CENTER AND HOW WE HAVE CONTINUED TO WORK WITH THEM. REST, FORREST TO YOU DIV DO HAVG TO ADD?
00:13:01.126: >> SOME OF YOU MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH THE LAKE TRANSIT CENTER, THIS WAS BUILT AT -- I THINK AT LIMITED CAPACITY. SO EVEN RIGHT NOW, WE HAVE FIVE BUSES PARKED OFFSHEET TERMINAL, I MEAN, WITHIN THE TRANSIT CENTER AND THERE ARE 10 BUSES PARKED ON FOURTH AVENUE, WHICH IS NOT DESIRABLE FROM THE RIDERS PERSPECTIVE AS YOU MAY KNOW THIS WOULD DISPLACE FOUR OR FIVE BUSES FROM FORREST AVENUE AND FIFTH. SO WE ARE ALREADY RUNNING AT CAPACITY AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY OF WORKING WITH THE HOUSING COMMISSION, D.D.A. AND THE CITY, YOU KNOW, PLANNING AND TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT. SO WE WILL WORK TOGETHER AND TRY TO SOLVE THE WITH SOME CONSIDERATION FOR TRANSIT NEEDS AND OTHER NEEDS. YOU KNOW, FOR NOW, I THINK WE ARE WITH THE FOURTH AVENUE DESIGN, EVERY DAY, ON THE TYPICAL DAY, I WOULD SAY, WE HAVE ABOUT 4,000 OR 5,000 PEOPLE USE THE BUS LAKE CENTER, THAT'S A LOT OF PEOPLE WALKING AROUND, YOU KNOW, CROSSING THE STREETS, TRANSFER BETWEEN BUSES. SO THERE ARE ALSO SAFETY CONCERNED ALONG THOSE TWO STREETS AT THE TERMINAL AREA. ANY WAY, TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES, I THINK THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO ADD SOME CAPACITY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE PEDESTRIAN MOVEMENT ISSUES, YOU KNOW, TRAFFIC, ON SITE TRAFFIC ISSUES AND THEN PROVIDE A MORE TRANSIT-FRIENDLY OR PEDESTRIAN-FRIENDLY ENVIRONMENT. AROUND THE EXISTING BLAKE TRANSIT CENTER. I REALLY APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY. THANKS, MICHAEL. INTO THANKS, FORREST THIS ALSO HAS BEEN IN CONJUNCTION. SOME OF THE ITEMS THAT FORREST REFERENCED, WITH THE WORK THAT MAURA AND HER TEAM AT THE D.D.A. HAVE BEEN WORKING ON, AS IT RELATES TO PEDESTRIAN-FRIENDLY STREET. AND I WOULD LIKE MAURA, IF SHE'S ON TO PERHAPS CHIME IN AND KIND OF DESCRIBE A LITTLE BIT OF THE CONTEXT AS FORREST ALLUDED TO ON FOURTH AVENUE.
00:15:34.179: >> YEAH, SURE. HI, EVERYBODY, MAHRA. THOMPSON WITH THE DOWNFOUND DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY. SO JUST A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND, THE D.D.A. HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS PROJECT FOR THE LAST, I GUESS IT'S BEEN TWO YEARS. WE FUNDED THE PREENTITLEMENT AND THE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT PROCESS AND NOW WE ARE PRIORITIZING THE WORK AROUND 350 SOUTH FIFTH IN THE NEXT ROUND OF PEOPLE-FRIENDLY STREETS PROJECTS. I KNOW A LOT OF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH THOSE PROJECTS. MOST OF THE D.D.A.'S PROJECTS OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS HAVE FALLEN UNDER THIS INITIATIVE AND THE GOALS OF THESE PROJECTS ARE VALUE DRIVEN, WITH AN EMPHASIS ON EQUITY, AFFORDABILITY, AND RESILIENCY, WHICH ALSO ALIGN WITH KEY CITY INITIATIVES OF ACHIEVING VISION ZERO OF 2025 AND INCREASING THE STOCK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND REACHING CARBON NEUTRALITY BY 2030. THESE VALUES ARE THE CORNERSTONE OF ALL THE D.D.A. PROJECTS AND AS JENNIFER AND FORREST AND MICHAEL HAVE ALLUDED TO, 350 SOUTH FIFTH IS JUST A GREAT EXAMPLE OF HOW A COLLABORATIVE APPROACH HELPS US TO REACH THESE COLLECTIVE COMMUNITY GOALS AND MAXIMIZE THE PUBLIC BENEFIT THAT CAN BE ACHIEVED IN A PROJECT. SO THE D.D.A. IS REALLY EXCITED TO BE WORKING ALONGSIDE THE HOUSING COMMISSION, THE CITY AND THE A.A.A.T.A. ON THIS PROJECT. OUR ROLE AS, I THINK FORREST ALLUDED TO, ON THIS SITE WILL BE STREETSCAPE AND TRANSIT IMPROVEMENTS ALONG FOURTH AVE BETWEEN WILLIAM AND LIBERTY. IN, WE HELD PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT SESSIONS TO GATHER INPUT ON A NUMBER OF PROJECTS, INCLUDING THIS ONE, AND WE HEARD VERY CLEARLY A DESIRE TO SEE TRANSIT AND PEDESTRIANS PRIORITIZED ON THIS BLOCK OF FOURTH. AND THIS FEEDBACK WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE PRIORITIES IDENTIFIED IN THE DISCUSSIONS THAT WE HAD WITH THE HOUSING COMMISSION, A.A.A.T.A. AND THE CITY. MICHAEL, CAN YOU GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE? SO THE SCOPE OF OUR WORK WILL INCLUDE SOME UTILITY WORK TO SUPPORT THE HOUSING COMMISSION'S PROJECT. SIDEWALK WIDENING TO ACCOMMODATE THE LARGE VOLUME OF PEDESTRIAN ACTIVITY THAT ALREADY EXISTS ON THAT BLOCK AND THAT WE ANTICIPATE, OF COURSE IS ONLY GOING TO INCREASE ONCE WE HAVE RESIDENTS ON SITE. WE WILL ALSO BE INSTALLING SOME RAISED MIDBLOCK CROSSWALKS TO SLOW DOWN CARS AND IMPROVE SAFETY. THERE WILL BE AN EXPANDED AREA ON THE BLOCK FOR TRANSIT USE TO INCREASE THE EFFICIENCY OF OPERATIONS AT BLAKE. AND WE'LL BE DOING SOME OTHER STREETSCAPE IMPROVEMENTS FOR TREES AND LIGHTS AND THINGS THAT YOU SEE THERE IN THE RENDERING. THE TIMING OF THIS PROJECT FOR US WILL BE DETERMINED BY THE HOUSING COMMISSION. OTHER THAN THE UTILITY WORK, WE ANTICIPATE THE MAJORITY OF THE WORK THAT WE'LL BE DOING. TAKE PLACE ONCE THE HOUSING COMMISSION IS COMPLETING THEIR CONSTRUCTION.
00:18:25.149: >> IF I COULD ADD TO THAT. THANKS, MAURA. WHEN MAURA IS TALKING ABOUT UTILITY WORK. IT MAY SEEM, WHAT ARE YOU PUTTING SOME LIGHTS ON?
00:18:34.225: >> OH, NO.
00:18:34.525: >> WE ARE TALKING ABOUT VERY SIGNIFICANT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH UNDERGROUND UTILITIES, WATER, SEWER, STORMWATER AND THE LIKE, AND SO THAT WOULD HAPPEN FIRST AND THEN WE WOULD HAVE A PHASED CONSTRUCTION PROJECT AND THEN THE SURFACE WORK ON THE STREET SIDE COMES AFTER THAT. AS FAR AS LIKE STAGING OF THE PROCESS. AND ALSO I WANTED TO MENTION WHEN YOU ADD A BUILDING TO A SITE, AND, OF COURSE, YOU KNOW WE HAVE DEAL WITH THIS AND THE CITY AND COUNCIL HAVE TO DEAL WITH IN AND PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT, ANY TIME A BUILDING IS BUILT IN A DOWNTOWN AREA WHERE THERE'S LOTS OF OTHER USES NEARBY, BUT PUTTING IT NEXT TO A TRANSIT CENTER WHERE THERE'S LOTS OF BUSES HAS ITS OWN SPECIAL CHALLENGES THAT BEING A PUBLIC ENTITY AS THE OWNER AND THE TRANSIT CENTER, YOU KNOW, BEING ALSO PUN LICKLY OWNED AND THE D.D.A. AS WELL, IT'S REALLY GIVEN US -- IT'S TAKEN TIME BUT IT'S GIVING US THE OPPORTUNITY TO, LIKE, FIGURE OUT EVERYBODY'S NEEDS AND FIGURE THAT OUT FIRST WHILE WE ARE GOING THROUGH THE SITE PLAN APPROVAL PROCESS. WHICH IS A DIFFERENT PROCESS THAN DOING AN RFP FOR A DEVELOPER TO PUT A PLAN TOGETHER AND OFFER A PRICE FOR A SITE. I ESPECIALLY APPRECIATE CITY COUNCIL GIVING THIS DIRECTION TO US, AND ALLOWING US TO WORK THROUGH ALL OF THESE ISSUES BECAUSE IT WILL MAKE IT A MUCH, MUCH BETTER PROJECT. HAD.
00:20:12.090: >> I WILL SAY SOMETHING THAT HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY PROUD TO SEE THE COLLABORATION THAT HAS TAKEN TO PLACE TO GET US TO THIS POINT AS WE SHOW YOU SOME PROGRESS HERE. SO THIS -- I THINK MAURA AND FORREST SET THE KIND OF CONTEXT PRETTY WELL AND, YOU KNOW, I THINK WHAT WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME AND EFFORT GETTING RIGHT WITH JENNIFER AND MAURA AND FOREST AND DEREK AND BRETT AND THE TEAM IS MAKING SURE THAT THIS GROUND PLAN WORKS AND THAT WE CAN, YOU KNOW, FEASIBLY GET THE NUMBER OF AFFORDABLE UNITS THAT WE NEED ON THE -- IN ADDITION TO CONTINUING TO SERVE THE EXPANSION OF THE BLAKE TRANSIT CENTER, WHILE FUNCTIONALLY SERVING THE BUILDING AND STILL CONTINUING TO PROVIDE AN ACTIVE WILLIAM STREET AND BIKEWAY. AND SO WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING AT HERE IS A KIND OF PLANNED VIEW THAT IS ANTICIPATED TO BE PART OF THE PUD SUBMITTAL, AND WE'RE CONTINUING TO KIND OF TWEAK TO GET RIGHT, EMPHASIZING TWO PHASES OF A BUILDING, PRIMARILY FOR FINANCIAL AND, YOU KNOW, GRANT KIND OF REASONS THAT THIS DOES ALLOW FOR THE P.1 OR THE KIND OF LEFT-MOST SIDE OF THIS BUILDING TO BE CONSIDERED AS AN ALL AFFORDABLE PROJECT WHICH WILL WOULD ALLOW IT TO RECEIVE POTENTIALLY 9% LITEC TAX CREDIT DEAL AND PUTS IT IN THAT JACKET AND THEN ALLOWING THE P2 VERSION TO BE A MORE TRADITIONAL 4% LITEC DEAL FOR THOSE THAT YOU HEARD JENNIFER TALK AT LEUNG. THAT SETS US UP FOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE FACING O WILLIAM STREET, WITN THE SEICE AND TRASHPACE BEHIND ALLIND OF ALLOWING THIS FOR THIS TO HAPPEN AT GRADE BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITIES THAT WOULD REQUIRE THAT TO HAPPEN BELOW GRADE. WHERE WE STARTED FROM THE ENGAGEMENT PROCESS AND YOU CAN SEE IT IN THIS VIEW INTENTIONALLY, YOU KNOW, KIND OF NOT ARCHITECTURALLY A ARTICULATD FOR A PUD PLAN HERE. YOU CAN SEE EFFORT GIVEN TO MAKING SURE THAT WHAT GETS APPROVED IN THE PUD ACTIVATES WILLIAM STREET, AND BUILDS TO THE STREET LINE AS HAS BEEN SAID AND ALLOWS FOR THE BUILDING ABOVE TO BE SET BACK. SO THIS IS A VIEW LOOKING AT WILLIAMS STREET DOWN TOWARDS THE WEST. A ZOOM IN VIEW LOOKING WEST ON WILLIAMS STREET EMPHASIZING SOME OF THE THOUGHT AND THE CARE THAT'S BEEN PUT IN TO ENSURE THAT THIS STREET SAFE CAN BE ACTIVE AS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ADJACENT TO THE WILLIAM STREET BIKEWAY. AND THEN REVERSE VIEW LOOKING EAST ON WILLIAMS STREET, THAT SHOWS BOTH THE ACTIVATION OF THE STREET AND THE KIND OF GENERAL SCALE AND MASSING OF THE VERTICAL CIRCULATION AND TOWER ABOVE THAT WOULD BE PERMITTED THROUGH THE PUD. THESE ARE TWO AERIAL VIEWS THAT EMPHASIZE THIS SO LOOKING AT THE CORNER FROM WILLIAM AND FIFTH, YOU KNOW, LOOKING DOWN TOWARDS, YOU CAN SEE THE TWO PHASED OPPORTUNITIES. JUST FOR SCALE AND ONE OF -- YOU KNOW, THE KIND OF CHANGES OR ASKS FROM HERE IN THE PUD IS SOME ADDITIONAL HEIGHT BEYOND THE  D.1 AND SO THE BUILDING ON THE LEFT IS SHOWN AS A 20-STORY BUILDING UP TO 275 FEET. THE BUILDING ON -- THAT SIDE OF THE BUILDING ON THE RIGHT. AND THAT WOULD BE AN ALL AFFORDABLE BUILDING. AND THEN YOU CAN SEE HOW THIS KIND OF BUILDING COULD BE CONTEMPLATED TO STILL SET BACK OFF OF BLAKE FOR THE DOUBLE-SIDED BLAKE CENTER. AND THEN, OF COURSE, THE SERVICE OF THE BUILDING BEHIND.
00:24:32.450: >> CAN I ADD SOMETHING.
00:24:34.418: >> PLEASE, JENNIFER, GO AHEAD.
00:24:36.053: >> SO IF YOU LOOKED AT AND GO BACK AND LOOK AT THE -- WHAT YOU ARE NOT GOING TO GO BACK, IF YOU LOOK AT THE FIRST SLIDE, THAT WE SHOWED OF THE BUILDING, THE -- FROM THE ORIGINAL COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT, AND YOU LOOK AT THE CURRENT BUILDING DESIRE, REALLY THE BIGGEST DRIVER OF THE CHANGE WAS THAT WE ORIGINALLY THOUGHT WE COULD HAVE A SHARED ALLEYWAY WITH THE BUSES THAT ARE COMING IN AND OUT. WE REALIZED THAT THAT WAS REALLY NOT A GREAT IDEA. THERE WAS WAY TOO MUCH POTENTIAL FOR CONFLICT AND SAFETY ISSUES AND IT FORCED US TO GO FROM A 3S SEPARATE FROM EACH OTHER. AND THAT FORCED CHANGES TO EVERY OTHER PART OF THE BUILDING WHICH I CAN'T TELL YOU ANYTHING ABOUT THAT, BUT MICHAEL CAN.
00:25:28.372: >> THANKS, JENNIFER AND HAPPY TO GO INTO SOME DETAIL OR ANSWER QUESTIONS AS WE GET INTO THE NEXT SLIDES BUT JENNIFER IS EXACTLY RIGHT. A SIGNIFICANT DRIVER FROM THE SETBACK PERSPECTIVE AND MAKING SURE THE BUILDING COULD WORK EFFICIENTLY, BUT THIS IS A SOLUTION THAT WORKS AND WE THINK IS STILL IN LINE WITH WHAT WE HAVE HEARD FROM THE PUBLIC TO DATE. SO THAT THE LAST SLIDE. JENNIFER, I WILL DEFER TO YOU, BUT I THINK THE PREFERENCE IS TO PAUSE AND TAKE QUESTIONS ON THIS ONE BEFORE WE GO INTO THE OTHER FOUR SITES. SO HERE'S A SUMMARY OF THE NUMBERS THAT WE'RE TARGETING IN THIS CURRENT VERSION. YOU CAN SEE WHAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO, WHILE REDUCING THE SETAL NUMBER OF UNITS -- THE TOTAL NUMBER OF THE UNITS, WE HAVE INCREASED OR ARE TARGETING TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF AFFORDABLE UNITS. SO 40% AFFORDABLE THROUGHOUT THE PROJECT, 145 TOTAL AND THAT'S ACHIEVED THROUGH 100% OF ALL AFFORDABLE BUILDING IN THE P1 WING THAT'S SHOWN AND THEN 20% AFFORDABLE IN THE P2. SO JUST A QUICKATE ON PROCESS AND SCHEDULE AND THEN WE'LL OPEN IT UP FOR QUESTIONS. WE DID A DESIGN REVIEW BOARD MEETING LATE LAST YEAR, INTO KIND OF EARLY THIS YEAR AND THEN AS I ALLUDED TO JUST HOSTED A CITIZEN PARTICIPATION MEETING, I THINK THAT SAYS JUNE 14th. IT WAS ACTUALLY JUNE 10th AND WE ARE TARGETING SUBMITTING THE APPLICATION FOR THE PUD ON BEHALF OF THE ANN ARBOR HOUSING COMMISSION IN JULY SO THAT WE CAN GO TO PLANNING COMMISSION IN AUGUST AND/OR SEPTEMBER, AND THEN HOPE TO SEE YOU BACK HERE AT COUNCIL IN OCTOBER AND NOVEMBER.
00:27:31.762: >> AND THE LAUGH THING I WOULD LIKE TO ADD BEFORE WE OPEN IT UP FOR DISCUSSION IS IN THINKING ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO BE MOVING FORWARD, THE IDEA IS TO GET THE SIGH PLAN APPROVED AND THE ZONING APPROVED AND THEN SIMULTANEOUSLY, WE ARE WORKING ON A REQUEST FOR QUALIFICATION TO SELECT THE DEVELOPMENT PARTNER, BUT WE WON'T ACTUALLY GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS UNTIL AFTER WE HAVE GONE THROUGH THE SITE PLAN ZONING WITH THE CITY AND HAVE THAT FIRMED UP. THE IDEA IS FOR PHASE ONE, THE OWNER PROPERTY MANAGER AND IT'S TO BE DETERMINED HOW PHASE TWO WOULD END UP SHAKING OUT BUT IT LIKELY WOULD BE WE ARE LOOKING FOR A DEVELOPER NOT JUST TO OVERSEE THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, OVERSEE THE CONSTRUCTION BUT ALSO WOULD BE LIKELY THE CONDO THE SITE AND HAVE THEM AS THE OWNER, MANAGER OF THE PHASE TWO, WHICH IS MORE OF A MARKET RATE MIXED WITH AFFORDABLE, WHEREAS PHASE ONE WOULD BE AN ALL AFFORDABLE PROJECT AND IT REALLY DEPENDS ON WHO WE SELECT AS OUR QUALIFIED DEVELOPER THAT WE WANT TO PARTNER WITH. IT MAY BE AN ALL SENIOR OR IT COULD BE MARKET RATE, CONDO AND RENTAL. YOU KNOW, THAT PART OF IT IS TO BE DETERMINED STILL. AND WITH THAT, WE ARE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR SITE.
00:29:13.764: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS? COUNCILMEMBER, I CAN'T HEAR YOU.
00:29:23.507: >> Councilmember Briggs: CAN YOU HEAR ME.
00:29:24.408: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
00:29:25.476: >> Councilmember Briggs: THANKS FOR THE GREAT PRESENTATION. I'M GLAD TO SEE HOW THIS IS DEVELOPING. AA FEW QUESTIONS. CAN YOU EXPLAIN MORE WHY THIS IS BEING ENVISIONED AS P1 BEING THE -- KIND  OF PRIMARILY AFFORDABLE AND THEN P2, AS MARKET RATE AND A FEW AFFORDABLE. ONE THE CONCERNS THAT PLANNING COMMISSION HAS HAD IN THE PAST IS SORT OF THIS IDEA YOU HAVE ONE BUILDING THAT -- IT'S FOLKS THAT ARE REALLY DIVIDED. MAYBE IF YOU COULD SHARE MORE INFORMATION ON WHY THAT APPROACH IS TAKEN AND HAS ANY CONSIDERATION BEEN GIVEN TO MAKE THAT AS AN ALL-ELECTRIC SITE.
00:30:20.297: >> I WILL TAKE THE SECOND QUESTION FIRST. YES. WHEN IT COMES TO FINANCING OF AFFORDABLE PROJECTS, AS WELL ASKING MANAGING PROJECTS THERE IS A LOT OF THINGS YOU HAVE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION ON THE FINANCIAL SIDE YOU HAVE PROBABLY ALL TALKED ME ABOUT THE LOW-INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT. THERE'S NOT A BIG POT OF H.U.D. FUNDS. THERE MIGHT BE NOW, BUT TYPICALLY THERE'S NOT A BIG POT OF FEDERAL FUNDS AND THE BIGGEST SOURCE IS LOW-INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS. THEY HAVE VERY SPECIFIC RULES ABOUT WHAT MAKES -- I WON EVEN SHEA RULES BUT WHAT MAKES YOUR PROJECT COMPETITIVE, THE TYPES OF FEATURES THAT YOU HAVE IN IT, WHICH INCLUDES GREEN AND SUSTAINABILITY FEATURES BUT ALSO INCLUDES MAXIMIZING THE AFFORDABLE UNITS AT THAT SITE, BUT IT ALSO HAS CAPS. IT HAS DEVELOPMENT COST CAPS. AND SO IT'S NOT AN UNLIMITED PER SITE UNLIMITED AMOUNT OF FUNDING. YOU ALWAYS END UP WITH A CAP ON IT. AND SO WHEN YOU ARE LOOKING AT DIFFERENT SITES. TYPICALLY YOU DON'T SEE A -- WHEN WE SAY ALL AFFORDABLE, IT WOULD MOST LIKELY BE A MIXTURE OF 30% OF MEDIAN INCOME, 40, 50, 60% AND MAYBE SOME 80% BECAUSE THE TAX CREDIT GOES UP TO 80% NOW. YOU CAN DO AN AVERAGE OF 60%. BUT THAT IS A PROJECT THAT WORKS FROM A FINANCIAL PERSPECTIVE AND IS LIKELY TO BE NO MORE THAN 60 OR 90 UNITS SOMEWHERE IN THERE AND THEN THE REST HAS TO BE COMPLETELY SUBSIDIZED WITH THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING MILLAGE, WE -- AND OTHER SOURCES OF FUNDS THAT WILL APPLY TO, WE CAN ACTUALLY MAKE THIS A BIGGER PROJECT THAN WE NORMALLY WOULD AT SITES THAT WE OTHERWISE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO DO. I THINK WE HAVE LIKE 130 ON THAT SITE. WE WOULDN'T HAVE 130 ON ONE SITE WITHOUT THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING MILLAGE TO SUPPORT. THAT WHEN WE LOOKED AT BEST PRACTICES FOR INCOME MIXES WHEN THERE'S THIS IDEAL THAT YOU WANT TO, HAVE YOU KNOW, ALL KINDS OF INCOMES HAPPILY LIVING TOGETHER. IN THE SAME SPACE, WITH, YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY GETTING ALONG AND EVERYTHING WORKS OUT, THE CHALLENGES WITH INCOME MIXING, THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE STUDIED IT AND LOOKED AT MIXED INCOME PROJECTS, THE WAY IT WORKS THE BEST IS IF YOU HAVE INCOMES THAT ARE CLOSER TOGETHER ON THE SPECTRUM. SO IF YOU WANT TO INCLUDE PERMANENT SUPPORT OF HOUSING, WHICH WE WOULD HIKE TO DO HERE BECAUSE THIS IS A SITE -- LIKE TO DO HERE, BECAUSE IN IS A SITE THAT USED TO  S.R.O.s THAT WERE MANAGED BY THE Y AND WORE EXTREMELY AFFORDABLE. IF YOU WANT TO INCLUDE PEOPLE WHO CAN AFFORD 30% A.M.I. OR LESS TYPE RENTS, THEN THE INCOME MIX THAT WORKED BEST WITH THAT ARE INCOMED THAT ARE CLOSER TO THAT. SO YOU WOULD BE LIKE A 30, 40, 50, 60, UP TO 80% A.M.I. THAT WORKS WELL BUT MIXING IN HOUSE HOLDS AT 30% OF A.M.I., PERMANENT SUPPORT OF HOUSING WITH MARKET RATE HOUSING, YOU KNOW, CHARGING WHAT OUR DOWNTOWN RENTS OR DOWNTOWN CONDOS ARE, THEY TEND NOT TO BE SUCCESSFUL. PART OF THE DIFFICULTY. I KNOW THIS IS A VERY LONG ANSWER BUT THIS IS ACTUALLY VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION TO ASK BECAUSE THERE'S A -- IT'S A CHALLENGE FOR -- IT'S MARKET CHALLENGE FOR REPORT MANAGERS AND OWNERS WHO HAVE HIGH COST HOUSING, WHATEVER TYPE IT IS TO INTEGRATE LOWER INCOM HOUSI ONOUAVE T FANALPLA. CHALLENG AND S YOU HAVE TO HAVE SUBSIDIES. SO LET'S SAY YOU CAN DEAL WITH THAT. LET'S THROW AS MUCH MILLAGE MONEY AS WE WANT. WE DEAL WITH THAT PART OF IT. THEN THE CHALLENGE BECOMES ISSUES OF SCREENING TENANTS IN, YOU KNOW, SCREENING TENANTS OUT. SCREENING TENANTS FOR CRIMINAL BACKGROUND, FOR PAST HISTORY OF EVICTION, SCREENING TENANTS BY THEIR INCOME CAPACITY. AND SO WHEN THERE'S JUST A MARK PRESSURE FOR THAT TO BE SCREENED OUT, AND IT ALL MEANS IF SOMEBODY DOES GET IN WHO MAY HAVE SOME LEASE VIOLATIONS, THE REACTION IS TO EVICT THEM RATHER THAN DO THE KIND OF WORK THAT WE DO AND WE PARTNER WITH OUR LOCAL NONPROFITS WITH WE HAVE SERVICE PROVIDERS, OW  OUR GOAL IS NO EVICTIONS AS MUCH AS WE CAN POSSIBLY DO THAT. WE HAVE SERVICE PROVIDERS THAT WORK WITH FOLKS WHATEVER THE ISSUE IS, WHETHER IT'S, YOU KNOW, NOISE FOR FIGHTING WITH NEIGHBORS OR NOT PAYING YOUR RENT AND SO IF YOU HAVE -- SOMETIMES WE HAVE TENANTS THAT NOR WHATEVER REASON, THEY MIGHT PULL THE FIRE ALARM IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. YOU CAN ONLY TOLERATE THAT SO MUCH, WHEN YOU HAVE $3,000 A MONTH RENTS. THE FIRST TIME THAT HAPPENS, THEY ARE EVICTED. THE REASON AS LOOKING THE ALL AFFORDABLE AND NOT THE ENTIRE SITE AS ALL AFFORDABLE IS BOTH WHAT CAN WE FINANCIALLY FEASIBLY DO AS MUCH AFFORDABLE AS POSSIBLE AND THAT MEANS PUTTING IT INTO THE SAME BUILDING. WE COULD NOT DO A PHASE TWO AND THEN OUR WHOLE EN ENTIRE SITE WD BE AFFORDABLE. IT'S BIG ENOUGH TO DO THIS PHASE TWO. WE DON'T SEE IT BEING FEASIBLE TO DO A SECOND TOWER LIKE THAT, BUT WE DO  DO A HIGHER MARK RAT. AND SEE IF THAT WORKS. ONE WAY THAT WE COULD WORK WITH A PHASE TWO IF IT ENDS UP BEING SENIOR. SENIOR HOUSING DEVELOPERS THAT ARE FOCUSED ON AFFORDABLE SEND TO BE ABLE TO SECURE DIFFERENT KINDS OF FUNDING THAT MAKES THAT PROJECT MORE FEASIBLE AND HAVE LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. DOES THAT ANSWER THE SPECTRUM OF YOUR QUESTIONS? AND I GUESS THE SECOND PIECE OF THAT IS WELL, WHAT ABOUT THE PROPERTY MANAGEMENT? I FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE WITH THE HOUSING COMMISSION MANAGING AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING. 80% TO 100% A.M.I. WE DON'T HAVE THE BACKGROUND -- WE HAVE NEVER DONE MARKET RATE AFFORDABLE MIXED HOUSING WHICH IS, AGAIN, EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE THE SKILLED TO DO OR HAVE THE ABLE TO RAISE THAT KIND OF CAPITAL TO PAY FOR THE MARKET RATE SIDE OF THINGS.
00:37:37.534: >> Councilmember Briggs: AND THE SECOND PART WAS THE ALL PERFECT.
00:37:42.973: >> MICHAEL, DO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT?
00:37:44.341: >> I WILL BE SUPER BRIEF. THE INTENT THAT, YES, THIS IS A NET ZERO READY BUILDING AND IT SHOULD BE A FULLY ELECTRIFIED BUILDING. THE INTENT IS TO WRITE THAT PIECE INTO THE RFP AND THEN, YOU KNOW, LOOK FOR INNOVATIONS FROM OUR DEVELOPER PARTNERS TO START TO RANK, YOU KNOW, HOW -- YOU KNOW, THAT AS A SCORING CRITERIA. THE OTHER PIECE I WILL CHIME IN REAL QUICK ON THE DESIGN SIDE. YOU KNOW, WHILE SHOWN AS TWO WINGS AND TWO PHASES, I THINK ONE THING THAT THIS GROUP CAN FOCUS ON, LOOKING FORWARD AND MAKING SURE WE HOLD THE DESIGN TEAM TO THE QUALITY OF BOTH SIDES OF THOSE BUILDINGS IS EXACTLY THE SAME AND THE LAYOUT OF THOSE IS DESIGNED IN SUCH A WAY THAT IS NOT EXCLUSIVE, BUT INCLUSIVE. I THINK THAT'S A REALLY GOOD POINT TO BRING UP.
00:38:46.970: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, AND SONG, AND THEN LET'S CALL IT A DAY AND MOVE ON TO THE NEXT PROJECT.
00:38:51.575: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION HERE TONIGHT. I HAVE QUITE A FEW QUESTIONS. HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET THROUGH THEM ALL. THE FIRST ONE, SINCE I ONLY HAVE ONE FOR THE D.D.A., IS THAT HOW WILL THEY BE FINANCING THE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THIS DEVELOPMENT AND DO THEY KNOW WHAT THE GOVERNMENTS WILL BE IN THE IMPROVEMENTS THEY PLAN TO MAKE? AND SO WHAT WOULD THE TOTAL COSTS BE? AND HOW WILL THAT BE -- ARE THEY PLANNING TO BOND IT?
00:39:25.008: >> NO. SO LAST YEAR THE D.D.A. BOARD APPROVED $10 MILLION FOR OUR NEXT ROUND OF PEOPLE FRIENDLY STREETS PROJECTS. $3 MILLION WAS COMMITTED TO STATE STREET AND $7 MILLION AS BUDGETED FOR FOUR ADDITIONAL STREETS THAT WE WOULD DETERMINE AFTER PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT, FEASIBILITY AND DATA ANALYSIS. SO THIS OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH THE HOUSING COMMISSION LIKE I MENTIONED EARLIER, PRIORITIZED FOURTH AVE AS ONE OF THE PEOPLE FRIENDLY PROJECTS. SO WE ESTIMATE THAT THE PROJECT WILL COST ABOUT 2.6 -- LET ME MAKE SURE. -- I HAVE TWO DIFFERENT NUMBERS MY HEAD. IT'S 2.6, IT WILL COME THROUGH OUR T.I.F. AND BE INCLUDED IN OUR C.I.P. WE WON'T BE BONDING OR ANYTHING FOR IT.
00:40:19.062: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, MAURA. I GUESS REAL QUICKLY, THERE'S NO OPPOSED PLANS TO HAVE ANY ON-SITE PARKING, INCLUDING FOR P2?
00:40:43.587: >> CURRENTLY NOT ANTICIPATING REQUIRING IT AS PER THE ZONING. THERE'S ALWAYS AN OPTION TO INCLUDE PARKING AND AS THIS COUNCIL KNOWS, THE EASIEST WAY TO DO THAT WOULD BE TO ACCESS FROM THE LIBRARY LANE GARAGE BECAUSE THERE'S NOT WAY TO GET RAMPING TO THIS SITE INDEPENDENTLY. THE ANALYSIS THAT WE RAN WAS IT WAS QUITE A COST BURDEN TO INQUIRE PARKING AND PERHAPS NOT THE RIGHT THING TO DO CONSIDERING THE QUANTITY OF PARKING ADJACENT AND HOPEFUL COMMITMENT FROM D.D.A. TO ALLOW THEM TO PARK IN EITHER ONE OF THE DECKS.
00:41:36.906: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THAT IS NOT AN ISSUE BECAUSE THAT IS MARKET RATE, BUT IT SEEMS TO BE A CONCERN FOR THE OWNERSHIP TO BE ABLE TO FINANCE THIS WITH PARKING OR NOT PARKING.
00:41:51.855: >> JENNIFER, YOU CAN CHIME IN YOU LIKE, OUTREACH THAT WE HAVE DONE TO DATE IS THAT NOT REQUIRING IT BUT ALLOWING FOR IT TO BE AN IT PROBABLY THE BEST WAY TO GO AT THIS POINT. JENNIFER, YOU ARE ON MUTE.
00:42:10.640: >> SORRY. THERE'S QUITE A FEW DEVELOPERSES THAT DO MARKET RATE HOUSING BELIEVE THAT THEY WILL JENNER -- GENERALLY, THE SENSE IS THAT WE WOULD WANT MAYBE 20% OF PARKING ABILITY ON THE MARKET RATE SIDE. BUT WE DIDN'T WANT TO PRESCRIBE THAT OR REQUIRE THAT BECAUSE REALLY OUR GOAL IS TO FIND A DEVELOPER WHO SHARES THE SAME VALUES AND HAS THE SAME GOALS FOR THE SITE THAT WE DO. AND SO WE WILL APPROACH IT FROM THAT WAY AND THAT CAN CHANGE WHO OUR DEVELOPMENT PARTNER IS AND WHAT THEY WANT TO BUILD.
00:42:45.075: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  AND WILL ONE BE CONSTRUCTED BEFORE THE OTHER OR WILL THEY BE DONE SIMULTANEOUSLY AND THE STAGING THE CONSTRUCTION? WILL IT CLOSE ANY STREETS DOWN? PAUSBECAUSE WE WERE WORKING IN H A TIGHT AREA?
00:43:00.323: >> YES, IT COULD BE BUILT TOGETHER AND IT COULD BE BUILT IN PHASES. THAT ALSO ADDS FLEXIBILITY. THE WAY WE UNDERWROTE IT, JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WAS FEASIBLE WAS A 9% TAX CREDIT DEAL ON PHASE ONE AND A 4% TAX CREDIT DEAL ON PHASE TWO. AND THOSE HAVE TO BE STANDALONE FINANCIALLY FEASIBLE ON THEIR OWN BUT IT DOESN'T PRECLUDE THEM FROM BEING CONSTRUCTED AT THE SAME TIME. IT DEPENDS ON WHO OUR PARTNER IS AND WHAT MAKES THE MOST SENSE AND I WILL LET MICHAEL ANSWER THE STREET CLOSING.
00:43:37.127: >> WE JUST HAVEN'T GOTTEN INTO THAT LEVEL OF DETAIL YET. IT'S A CONSTRAINED SITE, BUT BECAUSE OF THE L-SHAPED BUILDING AND SOME OF THE ADVANCEMENTS IN THE CONSTRUCTION TECHNOLOGY THAT WE ARE SEEING THESE DAYS, YOU KNOW, THERE AT LEAST IS AN OPTION TO STAGE THIS COMPLETELY ON SITE AND, YOU KNOW, LIMIT THE -- LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF CLOSURES THAT YOU HAVE TO DO BUT THAT WILL CERTAINLY BE SOMETHING THAT WILL COME IN MORE DETAILED CONVERSATIONS WITH DEVELOPERS AND CONTRACTORS.
00:44:06.356: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  AND ONE FINAL QUESTION. I APOLOGIZE FOR THE LENGTH OF TIME, BUT HOW MUCH OF OUR ANNUAL MILLAGE, WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE REVENUE THAT WE'RE SPEAKING OF IS, YOU KNOW, 20 YEARS, ONLY 20 YEARS? $130 MILLION? WHAT PERCENTAGE OF ALL OF THAT CAN WE COMFORTABLY SAY THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE COMMITTING TOWARDS -- FOR THIS ONE PARTICULAR PROJECT BECAUSE WE KNOW WE HAVE SEVERAL THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT.
00:44:37.320: >> RIGHT NOW WE HAVE $5 MILLION IN THE BUDGET. WHICH COULD INCREASE IN THE SECOND YEAR, BUT RIGHT NOW WE HAVE 5 MERCHANDISE -- $5 MILLION ALLOCATED.
00:44:48.865: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  AND SOMEONE HAS DONE THE FINANCIALS AND --
00:44:51.601: >> YES, THAT'S -- THAT'S WITH MARK NORMAN IS WORKING WITH US, WITH THE UNDERWRITING OF FEASIBLE CONSERVATIVELY FEASIBLE PROJECT OF COULD WE GET THE FINANCING FOR THIS TYPE OF PROJECT? EVERYTHING IS CONSTANTLY FLUCTUATING IN THE MARKETPLACE. AS PEOPLE KNOW, THERE'S SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES, COSTS ARE GOING UP. THINGS LIKE THAT. SO, YOU KNOW, TODAY WE CAN'T DEFINITIVELY SAY THIS IS EXACTLY THE DOLLAR AMOUNT, BUT BASED ON OUR CONSERVATIVE UNDERWRITING IF THE PROJECT WAS BUILT TODAY, WHICH IT WON'T BE. IT WILL BE IN A COUPLE OF YEARS WE CAN MAKE THAT WORK. AND I THINK IT DEFINITELY COULD INCREASE AND IT ALSO DEPENDS ON WHERE WE END UP ON THE OWNERSHIP OF THE LAND. OUR INTENT IS TO DO A GROUND LEASE WITH THE PRIVATE SIDE PICKING UP THE BULK OF THE GROUND LEASE COSTS BUT IT COULD BE THAT THE CITY NEEDS FUNDING TO PAY CASH TO PAY OFF THE DEBT AND THAT MAY BE AN OPTION AS WELL. SO THAT'S OPTIONS THAT WE CAN DO, EITHER ONE OF THOSE.
00:46:05.475: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU.
00:46:08.711: >> YEP.
00:46:10.079: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMAN SONG AND THEN NELSON.
00:46:11.481: >> Councilmember Song: FOR THE SECOND FLOOR, ARE THERE PLANS FOR THERE TO BE COMMERCIAL SPACE FOR THAT? AN IF NOT -- OR SPECIAL OFFICE SPACE? AND THEN THE SECOND QUESTION IS WOULD THERE BE A POSSIBILITY OF HAVING, SAY, NONPROFITS WHO WORK WITH US, LIKE AVALON TO BE ON SITE TO WORK DIRECTLY WITH LOW-INCOME RESIDENTS?
00:46:34.771: >> WE HAVE BUILT IN SORT OF SERVICE BASE, WHICH YOU MAY BE THKI OF AS OFFICE, BAUSE ITS OFFESOR SERVICES. I DON'T BELIEVE, MICHAEL, WE BUILT IT IN AS -- IT'S FLEXIBLE. IT COULD HAVE, LIKE GENERAL OFFICE SPACE AS RENTED, BUT NOT ON THE PHASE ONE POTENTIALLY IF A DEVELOPER WANTS TO DO THAT ON PHASE TWO AND THAT MAKES THEIR FINANCING WORK, THAT AS A POSSIBILITY, I BELIEVE.
00:47:00.063: >> YEP.
00:47:14.577: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
00:47:15.478: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I WAS INTRIGUED BY THE STAT TO THINNING ON OUT. I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT 45% OF CITY RESIDENTS ACTUALLY COMMUTE OUT. I WAS CURIOUS ABOUT WHAT THAT NUMBER WOULD BE. DO WE TAKE ANYTHING FROM THAT DATA WHEN WE TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT PARKING NEEDS ARE? A MEAN THIS IS A CURIOSITY THAT I HAVE ABOUT, YOU, HOUSING ABOUT HOW DO WE UNDERSTAND WHAT THE NEED ACTUALLY IS. I'M JUST CURIOUS. LIKE, ARE YOU -- ARE YOU LOOKING AT THAT AT ALL?
00:47:58.621: >> Councilmember Nelson:  DID I HEAR YOU SAY EARLIER THAT FOR THE MARK RATE, YOU WERE CONTENT PLAITING LIKE 20% OF THE HOUSING WOULD HAVE ANY SORT OF PARKING NEEDS OR --
00:48:11.734: >> OH, OH, OH, I SEE WHAT YOU ARE SAYING. THAT'S WHAT WE WERE HEARING FROM PRIVATE DEVELOPERS. ONES THAT DO THIS KIND OF DEVELOPMENT IN OTHER LOCATIONSEN BUT WERE NOT NECESSARILY GOING TO BE BIDDING ON THE PROJECT, JUST TO GET A SENSE AND THAT WAS THEIR SENSE IN AN URBAN AREA THAT PROBABLY 20% WOULD WANT PARKING BUT I WOULD DEFINITELY BELIEVE THAT WHATEVER DEVELOPER WE END UP PARTNERING WITH, THAT THEY ARE GOING TO DO A FRESH NEW ANALYSIS OF THAT BEFORE THEY FINALIZE WHAT THEY WANT TO DO. I THINK WE HAVE A SLIDE IN HERE ABOUT THE HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT THAT WE DID ABOUT WHAT THE DEMAND IS FOR VARIOUS INCOME LEVELS. I THINK WE HAVE A SLIDE IN THERE LATER ON ABOUT THAT AS WELL.
00:48:58.214: >> Councilmember Nelson: YEAH, I THOUGHT WAS AROUND MARKET RATE BECAUSE I DO SEE THIS AS SUCH -- AS AN ACCESSIBLE LOCATION AND -- OR ACCESSIBLE TO REALLY ANY PART OF THE CITY JUST BECAUSE OF THE BUS STATION. THANK YOU.
00:49:13.129: >> THANK YOU.
00:49:15.465: >> Mayor Taylor: MS. HALL, THANK YOU.
00:49:17.867: >> THANK YOU.
00:49:18.234: >> Mayor Taylor: NEXT DEVELOPMENT.
00:49:19.469: >> OKAY, I WILL KEEP ROLLING THROUGH THE --
00:49:22.371: >> Mayor Taylor: I'M SORRY SO I CAN TIME MANAGE, HOW MUCH MORE DO WE HAVE BECAUSE THERE WILL PROBABLY BE QUESTIONS ON THIS? I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE --
00:49:29.479: >> THERE ARE ABOUT 12 TO 25 SLIDES. I CAN GO G THROUGH THESE REALLY FAST. THEY WERE IN THE COUNCIL PACKET IN APRIL.
00:49:45.027: >> Mayor Taylor: I'M -- I'M KEEN TO HEAR STAFF'S PRESENTATION, PARTLY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CALIBRATE OUR QUESTIONS SO THAT WE CAN THEN UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH TIME FOR THE NEXT. AS YOU WILL.
00:50:00.977: >> THANK YOU.
00:50:01.844: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
00:50:06.549: >> SO QUICKLY TO PUT THOSE TWO SITES, THE SCREEN -- THE SITE 350 SOUTH FIFTH AND 315 WEST WASHINGTON THAT WE TALKED TO WASHINGTON BEFORE IN THE CONTEXT. FOUR ADDITIONAL SITES THAT WE HAVE RUN PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT THROUGH, BEGINNING IN FALL 2020, AND THROUGH THE CURRENT -- THE CURRENT TIME. A SERIES OF SITES. AND WHEN I REFERENCED THE 350 PLUS INDIVIDUALS THAT PARTICIPATED IN THE 350 SOUTH FIFTH AND THE 415 WEST WASHINGTON, WE HAD AN ADDITIONAL 650 SURVEY RESPONSES, 16 ADDITIONAL STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS AND THREE ENGAGEMENT SESSIONS ALL DONE VIRTUALLY, THROUGH COVID, IN ADDITION TO THE 6,000 MAILERS THAT WE SENT OUT WITH INDIVIDUALS LIVING WITHIN 1,000 FEET OF THE FOUR SITES THAT WE'LL TALK ABOUT HERE. AND WE SPENT AS JENNIFER ALLUDED TO EARLIER, SPENT A LOT OF TIME TARGETING INDIVIDUALS THAT DON'T OFTEN PARTICIPATE IN THESE KINDS OF CONVERSATIONS, AND PARTICULARLY -- AND THAT MEANS THE INDIVIDUALS DON'T LIVE IN OUR COMMUNITIES CURRENTLY BUT WOULD LIKE TO LIVE IN THE COMMUNITY IF THERE WERE OPPORTUNITIES TO DO SO. AND SO WE WERE TRACKING THE ENGAGEMENT THROUGH DIFFERENT QUESTIONS THAT WE WERE ASKING, PROXIMITY THAT INDIVIDUALS LIVE TO CERTAIN SITES, AGE, OF COURSE, RACE AND ETHNICITY AND THEN COMPARING THAT DO OUR CENSUS AND THEN WHETHER INDIVIDUALS CURRENTLY RENT OR OWN THEIR HOMES. WE DIDN'T QUITE GET TO THE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT NUMBER BUT WE WERE TYING REALLY HARD TO GET TO THOSE NUMBERS AS YOU CAN KIND OF SEE THROUGH SOME OF THESE NUMBERS. JENNIFER REFERRED TO BOWEN NATIONAL RESEARCH THAT DID RUN A PARALLEL HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT FOR DOWNTOWN. THE HIGH LEVEL TAKEAWAYS AND I THINK YOU HAVE BEEN PROVIDED THE FULL DOCUMENT HERE IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN THE SEVERAL HUNDRED PAGE READ. BUT THE ONE PAGE DEPAND FOR 1300 TO 1400 UNITS FOR LESS THAN 30% OF A.M.I., THE 700 TO 850 UNITS TO 60. THE MARKET WILL CONTINUE TO DRIVE GROWTH FOR HIGHER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS IN OUR DOWNTOWN AND, YOU KNOW, I THINK FURTHER FAME SIZING THE NEED FOR -- EMPHASIZING THE NEED FOR THE CITY TO TAKE AN ACTIVE ROLE TO CONTINUE TO BUILD MIXED INCOME IN DOWNTOWN. AND THESE SEVEN SITES ARE MARKETABLE FOR AFFORDABLE RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT AND THEN SPECIFICALLY THESE FOUR SITES THAT WE'LL TALK ABOUT. SO I WILL GO THROUGH THIS RATHER QUICK PACE AND THEN PLEASE ASK QUESTIONS AT THE END. 121 EAST CATHERINE WAS THE FIRST SITE. WE DID ASK INDIVIDUALS THE VARIOUS FORMATS OF ENGAGEMENT ENGAGEMENTSOME OF THE OBJECTIVEY PREFERRED MAXIMIZING AFFORDABLE HOUSING AT THE TOP BEING ACTIVATING THE GROUND FLOOR FOR PUBLIC BENEFIT, AND MIXED HOUSING USE AND TYPES, NUMBER THREE. AND THEN PARKING ON SITE ACTUALLY RANKED LOWER IN THIS CRITERIA. WE DID THEN ALSO ALLOW THE PUBLIC TO KIND OF RANK A SERIES OF OPTIONS ALL WITHIN THE D.2 ZONING AND CLEAR PREFERENCE FOR THE TWO -- THE TWO OPTIONS WHICH WERE FIVE-STORY AND SIX-STORY OPTION, ONE YIELDING 70 TO 80 UNITS AND ONE YIELDING, 85 TO 95 UNITS. I THINK THERE WAS A CLEAR PREFERENCE THAT THE BUILDING DESIGN, HOWEVER IT PLAYS OUT IN EITHER OF THOSE SCENARIOS SHOULD MAKE SURE THAT IT IS DIFFERENTIAL TO SOME OF THE ADJACENT BUILDINGS IN SCALE. DOCTOR. WE ALSO ASKED THE PUBLIC WHAT DOES THAT MEAN ON, REGARDLESS OF A FOUR OR FIVE OR SIX STORY BUILDING AND SO THE THREE OPTIONS THAT WE LOOKED AT WERE MAXIMIZING THE AMOUNT OF SURFACE PARKING AND THE BUILDING THAT LANDED ON THE GROUND WITH AN ACTIVE FRONT HIDING PARKING AND THE LOBBY AND THE STAIR CORRIDOR, AND AN OPTION IN THE MIDDLE THAT PRESERVED ABOUT HALF OF THE PARKING -- THE SURFACE PARKs PLACES ON HERE AT THE CORNER OF 4th AND CATHERINE BUT THEN HAD MORE INTENTIONAL AND ROBUST ACTIVE USE FACING. AND THEN THE THIRD OPTION WHICH -- AND THEN ACTIVE RETAIL ALONG ALL FOUR SIDES THAT THE COSTS -- THE COSTS ARE PRETTY PROHIBITIVE FOR THAT THIRD OPTION. WE WERE PRETTY CLEAR ON THAT, BUT THE PUBLIC -- THERE WAS A CLEAR PREFERENCE FOR BOTH MAXIMIZING THE AMOUNT OF PARKING AND STILL PROVIDING WAYS TO ACTIVATE THAT AND YOU CAN SEE THE BRACKETED PREFERENCE BETWEEN OPTIONS ONE AND TWO. AND SO THIS WAS A CONTINUATION -- IT HAD APPROVED 121 EAST CATHERINE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING, SUPPORTED BY THE RESOLUTIONS IN 2019. IT'S FURTHER REAI AFFIRMED UP TO THE 400% F.A.R. WHICH YIELDS FIVE TO SIX-STORY BUILDING AND MAXIMIZES THE STREET LEVEL PARKING BUT CREATING AND REINFORCING AN ACTIVE GROUND FLOOR AT THAT CORNER. AND SO NEXT STEPS IS THE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT TEAM AND MOVING FORWARD SITE PLAN IMPROVEMENT PROCESS, SIMILAR TO WHAT WE JUST PRESENTED FOR THE 350 SOUTH FIFTH. AN EMPHASIS HERE THAT HOUSING ABOVE PARKING IS -- IS -- THIS IS NOT MILLAGE THAT SEVERAL ASSOCIATE WITH THAT IS SHOWN ON THE LEFT, BUT ACTUALLY CAN BE DOPPLERDONE IN A WAY THAT REINFS THE QUALITY OF THE SPACE THAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR HERE IN THE OLD FOURTH WARD AND KERRYTOWN. MAURA, ANYTHING THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO ADD HERE ON THE --
00:57:02.665: >> SURE, I WILL TRY TO GO FAST. I WILL CHIME IN IN ON A FEW THINGS. SO FOR PAR PARKING CONSIDERATION THIS LOT. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT WITH THE OPTIONS THAT THE HOUSING COMMISSION IS LOOKING AT ON AVERAGE, IT WILL PROBABLY ELIMINATE HALF OF THE 49 SPACES THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN THAT LOT. AND THAT MAKES UP ABOUT 2% OF THE OFF-STREET AND METERED ON-STREET SPACES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD SO ALTHOUGH THESE ARE REALLY CONVENIENT SPACES, I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT THERE IS AMPLE PARKING IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD, PARTICULARLY ON FARMERS MARK, WHEN THE ANN/ASHY GARAGE HAS SPACES. WE CAN DRAW UPON OUR EXPERIENCE IN THE LESSONS WE LEARNED WHILE WE WERE UNDERWAY WITH THE FIFTH AND THE DETROIT CONSTRUCTION PROJECT. ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES THAT WE CAN WORK TOWARDS SOLVING IS THIS DISCONNECTION BETWEEN THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND THE ANN ASHLEY STRUCTURE. FOR PEOPLE WITHOUT MOBILITY ISSUES, IT'S LITERALLY A BLOCK AND A HALF AWAY. IT'S A REAL SHORT WALK. SO WE ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE HOUSING COMMISSION, THE KERRYTOWN NEIGHBORHOOD AND OUR COLLEAGUES AT THE FARMER'S MARKET DURING THE CONSTRUCTION PROJECT TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO MITIGATE THE IMPACTS ON PARKING THROUGH WAYFINDING MAPS AND OTHER CREATIVE SOLUTIONS. NOW THE ROLE IN THIS PROJECT WHICH WILL BEGIN NEXT SPRING, WE WERE ABLE TO PRIORITIZE THIS PROJECT IN THE NEXT ROUND OF PEOPLE FRIENDLY STREETS PROJECTS. SO WE WILL GET IN THERE AHEAD OF HOUSING COMMISSION AND WE ARE MAIN T EXTEND THE PROJECT ANDER WE WILL ENVIRONNT FEND THE PROTECTED BIKEWAY BY INSTALLING A TWO-WAYROTECTED BIKEWAY OPEN THE SOUTH SIDE OF MILLER CATHERINE FROM DIVISION TO CHAPIN AND THAT'S ON THE OPPOSITE SITE WHERE WE HAD THE PILOT. IF YOU RECALL, WE HAD THE PILOT ON THE NORTH SIDE. WE LEARNED A LOT OF LESSONS AND RECOGNIZED THAT THE SOUTH SIDE IS A BETTER SPOT FOR IT. AND WITH THIS BIKE LANE, JUST TO POINT OUT THAT IT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE CITY'S 2025 VISION ZERO GOAL AS THIS STREET WAS IDENTIFIED AS ONE THE TIER ONE FOCUS CORRIDORS AND THE TRANSPORTATION MASTER PLAN. SO WE PLAN ON GETTING IN THERE, DOING THAT WATER MAIN WORK, THE PROTECTED BIKE LANE AND THEN COMING BACK IN AFTER THE HOUSING COMMISSION DOES THEIR WORK TO DO ALLEY RESTORATION AND SOME STREETSCAPE RESTORATION. I HOPE THAT WAS FAST ENOUGH.
00:59:48.430: >> I SEE COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER'S HAPPENS UP. DO YOU WANT ME TO TAKE QUESTIONS AT THE END OR --
00:59:56.872: >> Mayor Taylor: LET'S ROLL WITH QUESTIONS ALONG THE WAY. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
00:59:59.541: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANKS. SO, I MEAN, I WILL SAVE A GENERAL QUESTION UNTIL THE END ABOUT THE POTENTIAL THAT WE NEED TO REVISIT P1 AND D2 TO INCENTIVIZE MARKET RESPONSES TO OUR ACTUAL NEEDS. CREATING ONLY THE MARK MARKET V, OR HIGH-END, I WONDER IF WE MIGHT RECONSIDER, IN D1 AND D2, WHY WHEN WE LOOKED AT THAT CATHERINE AND FOURTH PROJECT, WHY IS THE PARKING NOT OUT ON THE CORNER? WHY IS IT OUT ON THE CORNER TO CONTINUE TO HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO FACILITATE THE PUBLIC PLAZA LIKE HAS BEEN USED FOR SO MANY YEARS THERE, WHERE THEY SHUT IT DOWN FOR VARIOUS EVENTS, AFRICAN AMERICAN FESTIVAL, PRIDE FEST AND SO ON. HOW COME THE PARKING IS TUCKED BEHIND INSTEAD OF OUT ON THE CORNER. I KNOW THERE'S A GENERAL NOTION BY HAVING BUSINESSES UP AGAINST THE SIDEWALK BUT IT ALSO -- THAT ALSO HAS A TENDENCY TO CREATE THIS KIND OF ALLEY OR CANYON-TYPE EFFECT AND I'M NOT SURE THAT IT'S WORKING FOR US. I WONDER HOW IT BECAME STUFFED IN THE BACK INSTEAD OF OPENING UP ALONG THE STREET OR CREATING VISTA AND VIEWS THAT TO ME ARE INDICATIVE MORE HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT, AND SAFE ENVIRONMENT.
01:01:22.958: >> THANKS FOR THE QUESTION. I THINK THERE'S A COUPLE OF THOUGHTS THERE. AND I WILL EMPHASIZE THAT. MUCH OF THE CONSIDERATION WAS THAT CORNER AT FOURTH AND CATHERINE, REALLY BEING AN OPPORTUNITY TO BEING KIND OF A BETTER GATEWAY INTO THE FARMER'S MARK AREAS AND OLD FOURTH WARD. THE CORNER IS NOT A GOOD PLACE FOR MAXI MAXIMIZING PARKING SPA. THE LOBBY DOES HAVE TO TOUCH THE GROUND SOMEWHERE. SO THAT COULD BE A PLACE TO DO THAT, BUT AS YOU ALLUDED TO, YOU KNOW, THERE'S A LOT OF DISCUSSION THAT HAS TO HAPPEN ABOUT THEN, BEST WAY TO ANNOUNCE WHERE PARKING IS AND HOW TO ACCESS THAT PARKING, BOTH EITHER FROM THE ALLEY AND/OR FROM FOURTH AS THE BUILDING DESIGN MOVING FORWARD AND THEN WHAT IS THAT EXPERIENCE WALKING ALONG FOURTH AS WELL AND WHAT HAPPENS BEING RIGHT, AS THEY ARE ACTUALLY ACTIVE PROGRAMMING, OR IS IT SOME SORT OF KIND OF -- ARE WE THINKING ABOUT MUSEUM SPACE THAT COULD IN MANY WAYS MEMORIALIZE AND ACTIVATE, WHERE THE AREA WAS AND HAS BEEN IN OUR COMMUNITY AS WELL. SO MORE TO COME.
01:02:54.816: >> Mayor Taylor: ALL RIGHT. SINCE WE PAUSED FOR A SECOND ON THIS. I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT FOR MY PART, I APPRECIATE THAT SOME FOLKS DO VALUE TO THE PARKING THAT'S THERE. I DO UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S A SMALL PORTION OF THE PARKING IN THE AREA, AND I HEARD MAXIMIZED PARKING A NUMBER OF TIMES THROUGH THE COURSE OF THE PRESENTATION. YOU KNOW, I KNOW THAT WE ARE DOING THAT AND I WOULD RATHER MAXIMIZE A SECONDARRIZE AFTER UNITS THE STREET ACTIVITY, THE STREET ENGAGEMENT ACTIVITY AT THE LEVEL OF GRADE RATHER THAN PARKING AT GREAT RESIDENTIAL AT THE STOP. I WOULD BE MORE INTERESTED IN STREET FACING ACTIVITY AT GRADE.
01:03:51.807: >> THANK YOU. AND SEVERAL OF YOU PARTICIPATED IN MANY OF THE ENGAGEMENT SESSIONS. AS YOU ALL KNOW IT WAS VERY POLARIZING AND WE HAVE HEARD OPPOSITE EXTREMES ON BOTH ENDS ALTHOUGH I DO SAY AND WILL EMPHASIZE AND JENNIFER CAN AS WELL, WAIT WE HAVE CONTINUED TO BRACKET THIS, THAT WE PRESENT TO YOU TODAY I THINK HAS STARTED TO FIND A COMMON GROUND AND A COMPROMISE THAT I THINK AT LEAST I'M HOPEFUL IS A PLACE TO BUILD FROM, MOVING FORWARD. YOU KNOW, AT LEAST OUR COMMUNITY IS WILLING TO KIND OF CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD.
01:04:26.074: >> Mayor Taylor: FAIR POINT. 353.
01:04:27.709: >> SO THE 353 SOUTH MAIN STREET AFFECTIONIATELY KNOWN AS THE PALIO LOT. THE SAME QUESTIONS, THE SURVEY RESPONDENTS FOCUSED ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING ON THIS SITE, ACTIVATING THE GROUND FLOOR EVEN HIGHER HERE ENSURING THAT IT CONTRIBUTED TO THE MAIN STREET CHARACTER AND YOU CAN SEE PARKING ON SITE IS PRETTY LOW HERE. WE DID LOOK AT TWO OPTIONS, THIS IS ZONED D1 AND SO WE CANNOT HIT -- WE CANNOT GET TO THE HEIGHT REQUIREMENTS OF D1 BECAUSE YOU MAX OUT F.A.R. A 900%, ON THIS SMALL LOT IS A NINE OR TEN STORY BUILDING AND SO WE BRACKETED TWO OPTIONS. FRANKLY JUST AS IT RELATED TO GIVING SOME SPACE HERE FOR FUTURE PARTNERS AND IT RELATES TO CONSTRUCTION COSTS, ONCE WE GO ABOVE A FIVE OR SIX STORY BUILDING THIS WOULD TRIGGER HIGH RAISE CONSTRUCTION STEEL FRAME, CONCRETE, ALL OF THE ABOVE AND FIRE CODE. THAT'S HIGH-RISE. SO THE TWO OPTIONS HERE, ONE THAT YIELDS 90 UNITS AND ONE THAT YIELDS 50, BOTH THIS SITE AND THE PREVIOUS SITE ARE PERFECT SCALE AS JENNIFER ALLUDED TO FOR ALL AFFORDABLE PROJECTS 9% LITEC DEALS AS APPROVED ON APRIL 19th. UP TO 900% AND 10 STORIES HOUSING COMMISSION AS A DEVELOPER AND CONTINUING TIPOFF FORWARD ON THE NEXT STEPS ON THIS SIDE SIMILAR TO THE 121 EAST CATHERINE SITE. 721 IS THE NEXT SITE. ANY QUESTIONS ON THE PREVIOUS BEFORE I MOVE ON? I'M TRYING TO KEEP Y'ALL ON SCHEDULE. SO FOR 721 NORTH MAIN, OF COURSE, A MUCH STUDIED SITE IN OUR CITY. THE FOCUS WERE CURRENTLY AFFECTIONATELY CALLING 123 WEST SUMMIT AND IT'S THE AREA OF THE SITE THAT'S OUT OF THE FLOODPLAIN, THE FLOODWAY AND FRONTS ON THE STREET, AND IT RESTRICTS THE KIND OF DEVELOPMENT WE WOULD BE LOOKING TO DO IN THE FLOODWAY. AGAIN, MAXIMIZING AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND ENGAGING IN THE TREELINE TRAIL, RAISING TO THE TOP HERE, MIX OF UNIT HOUSING AND PRICES, AND THEN YOU CAN SEE SOME OF THE OTHER CONSIDERATIONS. WE LOOKED AT A COUPLE OF OMS THAT WERE WITHIN CHARACTER WITHIN THE ADJACENT C1 ZONING IN THIS AREA AND THE PREFERENCE WAS AROUND A MIDRISE APARTMENT BUILDING THAT YIELDED APPROXIMATELY 19 UNITS AND FRONTED ON SUMMIT STREET, AND SO ON THE 19th, YOU APPROVED THE FIRST STEP IN THAT, WHICH WOULD BE TO DIVIDE THE PROPERTY BETWEEN THE FLOODWAY, THE FLOODPLAIN, KIND OF LOWER LAND PARCEL WITH THIS  14,520,000 SQUARE FEET AND DESIGNATING THE HOUSING COMMISSIONER AS A DEVELOPER THAT WOULD TARGET A THREE-STORY DEVELOPMENT WITH WALKUP UNITS ALONG SUMMIT. AND THEN THE FINAL SITE IS 309 SOUTH ASHLEY. THE KLINE LOT. YOU CAN SEE HOW OUR NEIGHBORS AND RESIDENTS RANKED SOME OF THEIR PREFERENCES FROM AN OBJECTIVE STANDPOINT. AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR 60% A.M.I., HOUSEHOLDS AT THE TOP, GROUND FLOOR PUBLIC BENEFIT. MIX OF HOUSING, PARKING RANKED HIGHER ON THIS SITE. AND THEN MAXIMIZED MARKET RESIDENTIAL THE LOWEST RANK. FOR THIS SITE WE ACNO, MA'AME AT WAS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN THE OTHER SITES AND KEPT IT ON KIND OF PACE WITH THE OTHER SITES THAT WE LOOKED AT BECAUSE I THINK IT WAS IMPORTANT TO HAVE AND WE THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION ON THIS SITE IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE OTHER SITES. BUT, YOU KNOW, WE LOOKED AT APRIL OPTION THAT ESSENTIALLY KIND OF MAXIMIZED D1 THE FLOOR AREA RATIO IN THIS SCENARIO BUILT ON TOP OF A PARKING GARAGE AND THEN, YOU KNOW, MAYBE A LOWER RISE OPTION THAT WAS BUILT ON TOP OF A PARKING GARAGE AND THE PUBLIC PREFERRED THE HIGHRISE OPTION. SIMILARLY, WE LOOKED AT AN OPTION OF KIND OF SEPARATING THAT PARCEL INTO TWO OR THREE PARCELS WHICH COULD INCLUDE EITHER SMALLER PARKING GARAGE OR OFFSITE PARKING AND THE PUBLIC, YOU KNOW, PREFERRED THAT KIND OF HIGHRISE OPTION FOR THAT. IT BECAME CLEAR THAT THIS WAS A CONVERSATION THAT WE PROBABLY NEEDED TO HAVE AS A COMMUNITY NOT IN THE CONTEXT OF A MORE BIASED LOOK AT AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND IT WAS MORE AROUND WHAT THIS LOT MIGHT NEED AND WHAT OUR DOWNTOWN MAY NEED FROM A PARKING STANDPOINT, PRIOR TO JUMPING INTO SPECIFICALLY A HOUSING FOCUSED CONVERSATION. AND SO THE RECOMMENDATION HERE IS TO CONTINUE THOSE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE D.D. AX AND THE DOWNTOWN BUSINESSES ABOUT WHAT THAT LONG-TERM SOLUTIONS AS RELATED TO DEVELOPMENT MIGHT MEAN, AND HOW WE MIGHT THINK ABOUT HOW THIS CONTRIBUTES TO THE MULTIPLE GOALS THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT AS A COMMUNITY. SO HERE'S A SUMMARY SLIDE AND I THINK THAT'S ALL I HAVE. QUESTIONS?
01:10:46.488: >> Mayor Taylor: ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS? WE HAVE BRIGGS AND RAMLAWI, IF YOU COULD BE QUICK BECAUSE WE HAVE ANOTHER PRESENTATION.
01:10:58.733: >> Councilmember Briggs: GOING BACK TO THE CATHERINE SITE, I WAS CURIOUS, IN TERMS OF PARTNERSHIPS IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION WITH THE COUNTY AND MAYBE THEIR FUTELANS RERDING THE PARKING LOT ACROSS THEAY A WHAT THEARE THINKING ABOUT THERE? AND THEN BECAUSE THIS IS SORT OF AN ICONIC AREA OF TOWN, HOW MUCH DESIGN IS -- HOW MUCH IS DESIGN BEING CONSIDERED IN THIS PROJECT?
01:11:24.092: >> I CAN ANSWER THE QUESTION ABOUT CONVERSATIONS WITH THE COUNTY. WE HAVE HAD CONVERSATIONS IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS ABOUT COUNTY OWNED SITES, FUTURE DEVELOPMENT, AFFORDABLE HOUSING, PARTNERING AND THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT IT. THEY'RE JUST NOT AT THE SAME PLACE TIMING-WISE AND, YOU KNOW, MAKING A SERIOUS MOVE FORWARD ON DOING THAT. AND SO WE DECIDED THAT WE WOULD GO AHEAD AND MOVE FORWARD BECAUSE THAT'S A PROJECT THAT RIGHT NOW THE WAY THAT TAX CREDIT FINANCING IS, AND THE WAY IT SCORES, IT'S LIKE ONE OF THE HOUSING SCORING SITES. SO I DON'T WANT TO GIVE UP AN OPPORTUNITY TO WAIT FOR A FUTURE PARTNERSHIP. WE DID DO A PARKING STUDY TO SEE WHAT IT WOULD COST TO DO AN UNDERGROUND PARKING FOR BOTH UNDER THE COUNTY SITE, AS WELL AS THE CITY SITE AND IT WAS -- I DON'T REMEMBER THE AMOUNT. IT WAS $130,000 OF PARKING SPACE, I THINK WAS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE ALSO LOOKED AT.
01:12:32.527: >> AND QUICKLY FROM THE DESIGN SITE, I WOULD SAY THIS SITE IS AN ICONIC GATEWAYS INTO OUR TOWN AND WHILE DESIGN IS AND SHOULD ALWAYS BE ON THE FOREFRONT, THIS SHOULD RECEIVE THE EXTRA SCRUTINY THAT IT HAS ALREADY RECEIVED AND SHOULD CONTINUE TO. WE ARE NOT THERE YET BUT WE LOOK FORWARD TO THOSE KIND OF NEXT STEPS.
01:12:58.520: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:12:59.721: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES, JUST WITH CADENCE, HOW OFTEN WE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET THESE TYPE OF UPDATES ON THESE PROJECTS AND FEEDBACK. WHAT ARE WE LOOKING AT IN TERMS OF CADENCE?
01:13:15.169: >> I MEAN, WE CAN DO EVERY YEAR, TWICE A YEAR, WHATEVER YOU WANT -- WHATEVER YOU WANT US TO DO, WE CAN GIVE YOU UPDATES. WE CAN GIVE YOU VERBAL SO YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ASK QUESTIONS. WE CAN GIVE YOU WRITTEN, LIKE IN APRIL WE PROVIDED A WRITTEN REPORT THAT WE HEARD FROM A COUPLE OF COUNCILMEMBERS THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY LIKE THIS AT A WORK SESSION. SO REALLY WE CAN DO AS MUCH AS YOU WANT US TO DO. WE DO HAVE TO COME BACK MULTIPLE TIMES TO PLANNING COMMISSION, CITY COUNCIL FOR, YOU KNOW, ZONING AND SITE PLAN AND YOU KNOW, WHEN WE GET TO OUR KEY PROCESSES SO WE WILL BE COMING BACK FOR SPECIFIC SITES. WE CAN ALSO UPDATE YOU ON OTHER SITES EVERY TIME WE DO THAT. THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM.
01:13:56.511: >> I WAS GOING TO TOUCH ON WHAT JEN SAYS. AS THIS MOVES, ESPECIALLY THE SITES MOVE INTO THE ENTITLEMENT PROCESS, YOU WILL SEE THEM ON A SEMIREGULAR BASIS FOR APPROVAL BEING NOT JUST FOR UPDATES BUT, YES, I THINK ALL OF COUNCIL IS AWARE THAT ALL OF THE THINGS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HERE AS THEY MOVE FORWARD IN ENTITLEMENT, REQUIRE PLANNING COMMISSION AND CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL AT DIFFERENT STAGES THAT. STAGES. THAT IS THE AREA THAT WE ARE MOVING INTO ESPECIALLY WITH THE SITES THAT ARE MORE UP FRONT.
01:14:29.577: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. MS. HALL ET AL. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THIS IS A LOT OF GREAT WORK AND IT'S EXACTLY -- YOU KNOW, EXACTLY THE SORT OF MOMENTUM THAT WE NEED TO MEET OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING GOALS. SO ONE AND ALL, THANK YOU.
01:14:44.859: >> THANK YOU.
01:14:52.266: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. SHEWCHUK, THE FLOOR IS YOURS.
01:15:16.257: >> HI, EVERYONE, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
01:15:18.493: >> Mayor Taylor: YES, WE CAN.
01:15:19.260: >> ALL RIGHT. ONE SECOND. LET ME BRING MY PRESENTATION UP. JACKIE, AM. I A PANELIST OR AN ATTENDEE.
01:15:47.622: >> Clerk Beaudry: I JUST GAVE YOU COHOST. SO YOU SHOULD HAVE PERMISSION TO SCREEN SHARE.
01:15:51.059: >> OH, THERE WE GO.
01:15:52.794: >> Clerk Beaudry: OKAY. THANK YOU.
01:16:12.413: >> ALL RIGHT. CAN EVERYBODY SEE THAT?
01:16:16.117: >> Mayor Taylor: YOU BET.
01:16:16.984: >> HELLO, EVERYONE. IT'S GOOD TO SEE EVERYBODY. SO WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS A SMART CITY STRATEGY. AND FIRST OF ALL, I WANTED TO START WITH, YOU KNOW, WHAT A SMART CITY IS. AND, YOU KNOW, MY DEFINITION OF IT IS REALLY IN QUOTES THERE AND A SMART CITY UTILIZES MODERN TECHNOLOGY, AND THE COLLECTION OF DATA TO MAXIMIZE OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY, REDUCE COSTS AND ENHANCE HOW WE SERVE OUR COMMUNITY. SO THE KEY THINGS BEING, YOU KNOW, MODERN TECHNOLOGY HAS COME A LONG WAY. IT ALLOWS US TO DO A LOT MORE THAT WE COULDN'T DO IN THE PAST. AND IN ADDITION TO THAT, COLLECTING DATA FROM THE ASSETS OUT IN THE FIELD REALLY, REALLY HELP US RUN THE BUSINESS A LOT BETTER AND A LOT MORE EFFICIENT. ONE THING YOU WILL FIND WHEN YOU GO OUT AND YOU LOOK AT OTHER SMART CITIES, YOU WILL SEE A LOT OF DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS. EVERYBODY WILL HAVE THEIR OWN VERSION OF IT. A LOT OF THE COMPONENTS ARE THE SAME BUT AALL CITIES ARE UNIQUE. AND THE STAR CITY SOLUTIONS THAT I TALK ABOUT TODAY, WE MAY OR MAY NEVER USE THEM, OKAY? I WILL GIVE YOU SOME EXAMPLES SOME OF REALLY, REALLY NEAT TECHNOLOGIES, BUT THE STUFF THAT I TALK ABOUT TODAY, I WILL TALK ABOUT THE STUFF THAT WE HAVE ALREADY BEEN DOING AND SOME OF THE STUFF THAT WE WILL BE DOING IN THE FUTURE, BUT -- BUT SOME OF THE THINGS I WILL JUST GIVE AS AN EXAMPLE OF -- OF THINGS THAT ARE POSSIBLE BUT NOT NECESSARILY -- IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT WE WILL EVER DEPLOY THEM EITHER. AND THE SMART CITY STRATEGY AND ALL THE WORK THAT WE HAVE DONE WITH OUR COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK, AND ALL OF OUR SYSTEMS AND I.T., ALL THE STUFF IN THE DATA CENTER THAT YOU NEVER SEE THAT'S BEHIND LOCKELOCKED DOORS, WHAT IT REALY DOES IS IT MAKES THINGS POSSIBLE. FOR THE FUTURE IT REMOVES BARRIERS SO WE CAN DO THICKS TO HELP THE COMMUNITY. WHEN IT COMES TO SMART CITIES, THERE ARE CERTAIN CORE ELEMENTS THAT I FEEL ARE NEEDED TO HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION. YOU HEARD OF IOT, AND IOT, THE , THE TARE THINGS. IT COULD BE A STREETLIGHT HEAD, A SMART STREETLIGHT HEAD, A SMART PARKING METER. IT COULD BE A TRASH OR RECYCLING BIN. IT COULD BE ANYTHING WHERE YOU CAN PUT A DEVICE OR A SENSOR ON. AND THEN WHAT YOU DO IS YOU TAKE THOSE DEVICES AND JUST LIKE A COMPUTER HOW THEY ARE CONNECTED TO A NETWORK, WOULD YOU CONNECT IT TO AN. EITHER A FIBER NETWORK OR A WIRELESS NETWORK AND THAT ALLOWS IT -- THAT ALLOWS US TO COMMUNICATE WITH THOSE DEVICES. THAT ALLOWS US TO LOOK AT THE HEALTH OF THEM AND PUSH DATA BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THEM. AND DATA STORAGE COMES IN, YOU KNOW, WE SAVE A LOT OF DATA IN THE CITY. WE HAVE A LOT OF DATA IN THE CITY, BUT AS WE PUT THESE DEVICES OUT IN THE FIELD, WE CONTINUE TO COLLECT DATA. AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO STORE THAT DATA AND THEN THE SOFTWARE THAT ACTUALLY CONTROLS THE DEVICES, THAT ALLOW YOU TO MANAGE THE DEVICE, IT ALLOWS YOU TO CHANGE THE DEVICES, LOOK AT THE HEALTH OF THE DEVICE, SEE IF IT'S WORKING, SEE IF IT'S NOT WORKING AND IT PROVIDES METRICS AND DASHBOARDS ABOUT THE DEVICES OUT THERE, HOW MUCH ENERGY THEY ARE USING WHETHER THEY ARE BROKEN, WHETHER THEY ARE FAILING. SO THE SOFTWARE IS REALLY KEY AND THEN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, MACHINE LEARNING IS PREVALENT IN THE IOT SPACE THESE DAYS WHERE IT TAKES THE HUMAN ELEMENTS OUT OF WATCHING THESE DEVICES AND ALLOWS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TO TAKE OVER AND MAKE DECISIONS. AND THEN THE LAST THING IS, IS THE IOT MANAGEMENT PLATFORM WILL PUSH AND PULL DATA FROM THESE DEVICES OUT IN THE FIELD. AND THEN THE LAST PIECE, WHICH IS REALLY, REALLY IMPORTANT IS OUR BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE PLATFORM OR OUR BIG DATA PLATFORM. YOU PROBABLY HEARD ME TALK ABOUT THAT BEFORE. BUT WHAT THAT DOES IS IT ALLOWS US -- WE HAVE A DATALAKE WHERE WE PUT THIS INFORMATION IN AND IT ALLOWS US TO DO ADVANCED ANALYTICS, YOU KNOW FROM THE CENTRAL LOCATION AND IT ALLOWS US TO DELIVER THAT INFORMATION BACK TO OUR BUSINESS UNIT SO THEY CAN MAKE GOOD DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR OPERATIONS. AND IF ANYBODY HAS ANY QUESTIONS, JUST FEEL FREE TO CHIME IN, AND I'M GOING TO THROW A LOT OF STUFF AT YOU. SO WHEN IT COMES TO A SMART CITY, THESE FIVE ELEMENTS ARE ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL IN ORDER TO HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN. WHAT DOES A SMART CITY LOOK LIKE? WE HAVE DOWNTOWN ANN ARBOR. WE HAVE A COUPLE OF LARGE CIRCLES. ONE WOULD BE OUR DATA CENTER, THE OTHER IS OUR COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK AND THEN ALL AROUND THE EDGES, YOU HAVE ALL OF THESE SENSORS, ALLOF THESE DEVICES AND YOU START ENVIRONMENTAL SENSORS AND SMART TRAFFIC LIGHTS AND SMART HOMES, ALL OF THESE TYPES OF THINGS WILL COMMUNICATE TO THE NETWORK AND IT WILL STORE THE DATA IN THE DATA CENTER AND ALLOW US TO COMMUNICATE WITH ALL OF THESE DEVICES THAT ARE OUT IN THE FIELD. NOW THE IMPORTANT THING IS -- AND I'M NOT GOING TO GO THROUGH ALL OF THESE, BUT THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF -- THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF USE CASES. SO I'M GOING TO TALK -- WHEN I SAY USE CASES, IT'S GOING TO BE ENVIRONMENTAL SENSORS WOULD BE ONE USE CASE. SMART STREETLIGHTING WOULD BE ANOTHER, PARKING WOULD BE ANOTHER. SO IT'S JUST DIFFERENT. IT'S DIFFERENT SENSORS DOING DIFFERENT THINGS IN THE CITY THAT ARE CONNECTED TO A NETWORK THAT ALLOWS US TO COMMUNICATE WITH THEM AND CAPTURE DATA AND CONTROL THEM. SO SO NOW TODAY THERE'S ABOUT 35 BILLION DEVICES OUT IN THE FIELD AND BY 2025, THERE WILL BE ABOUT 75 BILLION OF THESE WORLDWIDE. SO THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF THESE THINGS WILL BE OUT IN THE -- WHAT I CALL THE -- KIND OF THE WILD, AND TECHNOLOGY AND WHAT THEY HAVE DONE WITH TECHNOLOGY ALLOWS US TO PUT THESE DEVICE VIRTUALLY ON EVERY SINGLE ASSET THAT WE HAVE IN THE CITY. IT COULD BE A VEHICLE. IT COULD BE -- IT COULD BE A KAYAK OR A CANOE. IT COULD BE A BUILDING. IT COULD BE, YOU KNOW, ALLOWS YOU TO DO THIS.THAT SO WHAT I WANT TO DO IS TAKE YOU THROUGH AN EXAMPLE OF USING ALL OF THE ELEMENTS WITH A STREETLIGHT, BUT IF YOU TAKE ALL OF THOSE USE CASES, IT REALLY -- YOU CAN REALLY APPLY THIS CONCEPT TO JUST ABOUT ANYTHING THAT YOU APPLY OUT IN THE FIELD. IF YOU TAKE YOUR TRADITIONAL STREETLIGHT. REALLY STREETLIGHTS IN THE PAST, THEY REALLY WITH RESPECT VERY INTELLIGENT. YOU RAN POWER TO THEM. THEY LIT UP AND THEY HAD A PHOTOCELL IN THEM AND THEY TURNED ON AT NIGHT AND TURNED OFF IN THE MORNING AND THAT WAS THEXTENTF I SO WHAT WE DOS NOW WHAT WE CAN DO IS WE CAN PUTMART -- OOPS. WE CAN PUT A SMART HEAD ON THE STREETLIGHT, AND PUT A SENSOR ON IT, AND THEN WE CAN CONNECT IT TO THE NETWORK. SO WHAT THAT ALLOWS US TO DO. IT ALLOWS US TO SEE IT. IT ALLOWS US TO KNOW IF IT'S ON OR OFF, IT ALLOWS US TO TURN IT ON OR OFF AND WE CAN DO ALL SORTS OF THINGS WITH IT. THEN WHAT WE DO, ALL OF THAT INFORMATION IS THEN SENT TO OUR DATA CENTER SO WE CONTINUE TO CAPTURE THIS INFORMATION ABOUT THIS ASSET THAT'S OUT IN THE FIELD. AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS, THEN THIS IS WHERE THE SOFTWARE COMES IN AND SOFTWARE ALLOWS US TO UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH ENERGY THE LIGHT IS USING. IT ALLOWS US TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER THE L.E.D. MAY BE DEGRADING, AND IT MIGHT BE GOING BAD. IT ALLOWS US TO TURN US ON AND OFF, AND DIM IT AND CONTROL IT AND THEN IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG WITH IT, THE GOOD THING ABOUT IT, IT CAN PUSH DATA AND IT CAN PULL DATA AND IT CAN EMAIL ME. IT COULD TEXT ME. IT CAN NOTIFY ME AS SOON AS THAT LIGHT GOES BAD OR SOMETHING GOES WRONG WITH IT. SO -- AND THEN, ALL OF THE DATA THAT'S COLLECTED FROM THAT DEVICE, AND TODAY WE HAVE ABOUT 75 OF THESE SMART HEADS OUT THERE, T ON STREETLIGHTS. ALL OF THAT DATA IS STORED IN OUR DATA LAKE. AND ALL THE INFORMATION ABOUT THAT ASSET, ALL THE HISTORY OF IT, LIKE, YOU KNOW WHEN IT TURNED ON, AND WHEN IT TURNED OFF, WHETHER IT WAS DIMMED AT THE TIME OF AN INCIDENT THAT WAS OUT IN THE FIELD, ALL OF THAT INFORMATION IS CAPTURED, AND THEN IT CAN BE RECORDED ON, AND SENT BACK TO THE BUSINESS UNIT. SO WHAT YOU CAN DO IS BY CONNECTING THIS DEVICE, AND UNDERSTANDING ITS STATUS, YOU CAN DETERMINE WHETHER IT BREAKS AND IF IT BREAKS, WHAT YOU COULD DO -- SAY WE HAVE, YOU KNOW, 75 LIGHTS. SAY THREE LIGHTS GO OUT EVERY NIGHT. IF THOSE LIGHTS GO OUT, YOU CAN WRITE SOFTWARE TO SAY WHEN THE SERVICE -- WHEN THE SIGN SIGNALS PEOPLE TO COME IN IN THE MORNING, WE WILL HAVE YOU GO FIX ALL THE PROPANE LIGHTS AND IT ALREADY HAS A ROUTE SCHEDULED BASED ON THE INFORMATION THAT I HAVE FROM THOSE DEVICES. DOES THAT MAKE SENSE? IT'S PRETTY AUTOMATED AND BASICALLY IT ALLOWS TO YOU CONNECT TO SOMETHING AND UNDERSTAND IT AND MONITOR IT AND YOU CAN DO IT ANYWHERE YOU HAVE AN INTERNET CONNECTION. I COULD DO IT FROM MY PHONE HERE. COULD YOU BE HALFWAY ACROSS THE WORLD AND YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO CONTROL THAT LIGHT AND DO ANYTHING THAT YOU WANTED WITH IT. SO THAT'S THE GLORY OF CONNECTING AWFUL THESE DEVICES OUT IN THE -- ALL OF THESE DEVICES OUT IN THE FIELD. IT GIVES YOU AN INSIGHT TO THEM. WHAT HAPPENS TODAY IF THE STREETLIGHT GOES BY. EITHER THE SIGN AND THE SIGNAL, AND THEY DRIVE BY IT AND THEY NOTICE IT'S BAD OR A CITIZEN WILL HAVE TO CALL IT IN OR PUT AN A2FIX2 ORDER UP. IF YOU THINK OF IT THAT WAY, EPAER EITHER YOU ARE BURNING RESOURCES, TAKING TIME TO GO THROUGH THE ROUTE, OR A CITIZEN IS BEING INCONVENIENCED AND THEY HAVE TO PUT SOMETHING IN THE SYSTEM AND THEN CUSTOMER SERVICE GETS IT AND THEN A TICKET GOES INTO CITY WORKS. SO YOU CAN SEE IF WE KNOW THAT DEVICE IS DEFECTIVE AND WE CAN FIX IT, WHAT IT DOES, HOW MUCH TIME AND HOW EFFICIENT IT IS AND NOBODY WOULD EVEN KNOW IT WAS OUT. SO DOES THAT MAKE SENSE? OKAY. SO THERE'S SOME OTHER USE CASES, JUST TO KIND OF GIVE YOU AN IDEA THAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT. THINGS LIKE ENVIRONMENTAL SENSORS. WE CAN PUT THEM OUT IN THE FEEL AND WE CAN KNOW IT CAN REPORT ON CO2 EMISSIONS AND TOXIC GASES AND THINGS LIKE THAT, AND E.V. CHARGERS. WE CAN HOOK THEM TO THE NETWORK AS WELL. AND WE CAN MONITOR IT WELL. WE CAN MONITOR THE USAGE, HOW MUCH THEY ARE BEING USED, WHETHER WE NEED TO MOVE THEM TO DIFFERENT AREAS OF CITY. BUILDING AUTOMATION SYSTEMS. THE PRESENTATION WITH HOUSING WAS GREAT BECAUSE I WAS AWARE OF A COUPLE OF THOSE SITES THAT, YOU KNOW, WITH WE'RE POTENTIALLY BUILDING BUT PUTTING -- YOU KNOW, THERE'S NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT CAN GO INTO BILLINGS THAT' 50% OF THE COST OF OLD WIRING THAT GOES INTO BUILDINGS. AND WE SHOULD BE -- YOU KNOW, WE SHOULD BE AUTOMATING THOSE BUILDINGS AN WE SHOULD BE WIRING EVERY SINGLE ROOM OF THOSE BUILDINGS FOR THINGS LIKE AGING IN PLACE, TELEMEDICINE, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE NOT HAVING TO GET UP AND GO TO THE DOCTOR WHEN THEY CAN REPORT THEIR BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS TO A DOCTOR, YOU KNOW, OVER THE INTERNET. YOU KNOW, APPLICATIONS LIKE THAT. ENERGY USAGE IN A BUILDING. IF WE ARE BUILDING A BUILDING, WE SHOULD KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT THE ENERGY USAGE IN THAT BUILDING AND WE SHOULD HELP OUR TENANTS, YOU KNOW, MANAGE THEIR ENERGY AND, YOU KNOW, AND MANAGE COSTS. SO SOME OF OUR OLDER BUILDS, IT'S KIND OF DIFFICULT TO DO THAT AND WE HAVE CONNECTIVITY TO ALL OF OUR HOUSING BUILDINGS, BUT AS THESE NEW BUILDINGS ARE BUILT, WE NEED TO PUT VERY, VERY ADVANCED BUILDING AUTOMATION SYSTEMS IN THERE THAT WILL GIVE US ALL OF THAT INFORMATION AND WE SHOULD HAVE A CLEAR VIEW OF WHAT IS GOING ON IN THAT BUILDING AT ANY TIME OF THE DAY. OTHER THINGS LIKE SNOW SENSORS, YOU CAN PUT THEM OUT IN THE FIELD WHEN IT SNOWS. IF YOU GET A BUNCH OF SNOW ON ONE END OF THE DOWN AND A LITTLE KNOW ON THE OTHER END OF THE TOWN, YOU KNOW, YOU ALREADY KNOW WHERE THE SNOW IS AT AND THEN YOU CAN ADJUST YOUR ROUTES ACCORDINGLY TO TAKE CARE OF THE SNOW. AND THEN WE HAVE THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE HAS, YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE MOST ADVANCED CONNECTED VEHICLE LABS AND RESEARCH IN THE WORLD, AND THAT ALL RUNS ON URN OUR CURRENT NETWORK. AND WE ARE PUTTING MORE INFRASTRUCTURE ON THE GROUND TO STUDY TRAFFIC PATTERNS AND THEY CAN STUDY ENERGY USAGE AND PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC AND ALL KINDS OF STUFF. SO WHEN IT COMES TO THE MOBILITY, NOT -- TODAY, YOU KNOW, WHEN -- IF THE VEHICLE IS GOING THROUGH THE CITY, WHAT THEY CAN DO IS THEY CAN TALK TO ANOTHER VEHICLE IF THEY HAVE THE PROPER EQUIPMENT IN IT OR THEY GET TO AN INTERSECTION AND THEY UPLOAD THE DATA AT THE INTERSECTION AND THAT GOES TO THE U OF M DATA RESEARCH CENTER. WOULDN'T IT BE NICE IF WE HAD A REALLY, REALLY FAST NETWORK WHERE IT COULD UPLOAD THAT INFORMATION AND YOU COULD GET IT BACK IN REALTIME. SO YOU ARE A PEDESTRIAN AND YOU ARE WALKING DOWN THE STREET AND YOU HAVE YOUR HEAD DOWN AND IN YOUR PHONE. IF ONE OF THOSE CONNECTED VEHICLES ARE COMING DOWN THE STREET, IF THEY CAN GET INFORMATION TO YOUR PHONE QUICKLY TO SAY HEY, I'M COMING DOWN THE STREET, PLEASE GET YOUR HEAD OUT OF WHY YOU ARE PHONE, THAT'S THE TYPES OF THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO WITH THIS TECHNOLOGY BY MOVING DATA VERY, VERY QUICKLY THROUGH THE NETWORKS AND BEING ABLE TO TELL PEOPLE, HEY, YOU WILL GET HIT BY A CAR. ALL OF THAT STUFF EXISTS AND ALL OF THAT STUFF IS POSSIBLE WITH THIS TECHNOLOGY. THEN THE LAST THING, IS THE ACOUSTIC ACOUSTIC, VIBRATION SENSING. D.A.S., SPARK SET UP A MEETING TO TALK WITH THESE FOLKS BUT BRIDGE PATROLLING BOUGHT THIS COMPANY AND THE TECHNOLOGY THAT GOES ALONG WITH IT TO MONITOR ALL OF THEIR PIPELINES FOR LEAKS. AND WHAT THEY DO, THEY USE FIBER OPTICS TO SENSE VIBRATIONS IN THE GROUND. SO IF YOU HAVE A VEHICLE GOING OVER THE GROUND, THEY CAN TELL YOU IF IT'S ACOMPACT CAR. THEY CAN YOU IF IT'S A TRUCK OR A BICYCLE AND INCOME REPORT THAT DATA AND SO YOU KNOW A VEHICLE OF A CERTAIN TYPE IS COMING INTO THE CITY. WELL, SAY YOU HAVE A BIG TRUCK COMING INTO THE CITY THAT'S REALLY SPEWING A LOT OF CARBON EMISSIONS. AND YOU REALLY WANT TO GET THAT TRUCK THROUGH THE CITY VERY, VERY QUICKLY. THIS TECHNOLOGY CAN ACTUALLY SENSE THAT THAT TRUCK IS COMING IN AND SENSE WHERE IT IS ON THE ROADS. IT COULD COMMUNICATE WITH THE TRAFFIC CONTROL SYSTEM AND IT COULD GET THAT VEHICLE THROUGH THE CITY VERY, VERY QUICKLY SO THIS SPEWS LESS EMISSIONS OUT TO EVERYBODY. SO THOSE ARE JUST A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES OF -- THAT STUFF IS REALLY COOL. NOW, WHETHER WE IMPLIED THAT IN ANN ARBOR, I DON'T KNOW THAT WE WOULD, BUT IT'S JUST REALLY, REALLY COOL WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH THIS TECHNOLOGY. SO THE POINT IS ON THIS SLIDE AND THE MODEL TO THE LEFT IS -- IS REALLY IF YOU ARE GOING TO PUT A SMART CITY SOLUTION IN, YOU WANT TO DO IT COMPREHENSIVELY, AND THAT IS THAT YOU MAKE SURE THAT YOU USE ALL THE ELEMENTS THAT I TALKED ABOUT BEFORE, AND THEN WHAT WE DO IN THE I.T. DEPARTMENT WE HAVE PRODUCT DELIVERY TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE REALLY, REALLY GOOD REQUIREMENTS. WHAT ARE YOUR NEEDS YOU ARE TRYING TO SOLVE, WHAT ARE THE NEEDS? AND WHAT IS THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT. WE WANT TO INCREASE RISK AND INCREASE THE SUCCESS OF A PROJECT AND MEET THE NEEDS OF A DEPARTMENT OR WHOEVER WANTS TO SOLVE A PROBLEM. WE USE THIS MODEL AND WE RUN IT THROUGH THIS MODEL EVERY TIME TO MAKE SURE THAT WEAPTURE THAT STUFF, BUT THE OTHER REASONS WE DO IT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE INCLUDE THINGS THAT SOMETIMES GET MISSED. WHAT ABOUT IF WE ARE PUTTING A SOLUTION, IN DIVERSITY, EQUITY, INCLUSION, IS ALL OF THAT STUFF BEING EXCLUDED? IS SOMEBODY TAKING THAT INTO CONSIDERATION OR THIS PROJECT? SECURITY AND PRIVACY AND TRANSPARENCY NEEDS. ANY TIME WE DO ANYTHING FROM A TECHNOLOGY STANDPOINT. WE DON'T LEAD WITH TECHNOLOGY. WE LEAD WITH THE BUSINESS NEEDS AND THEN WE APPLY THE TECHNOLOGY TO THE BUSINESS NEEDS AFTERWARDS BUT WE MAKE SURE THAT THOSE COMPONENTS ARE INCLUDED IN -- THEY ARE ATTENDED TO IN THE SOLUTION. AND THEN WE WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING IS WHEN WE PUT -- IF WE CAN CONNECT THINGS TO THE NETWORK, WE CAN MONITOR IT AND UNDERSTAND THE ASSETS AND THAT WILL GIVE US AN OPPORTUNITY TO ANALYZE IT. YOU NOTICE T IN THIS MODEL, YOU HAVE THE PUTTING A SOLUTION IN PLACE AND, STUDYING THE DATE, AND THEN ACTING UPON IT, AND MAKING CHANGES BUT THEN YOU KEEP DOING IT. SO THE PROJECT REALLY NEVER STOPS. IT'S A CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT MODEL WHERE, YOU KNOW, YOU PUT SOMETHING IN. YOU STUDY THE DATA. YOU SEE HOW IT WORKS AND YOU MAKE CHANGES AND YOU STUDY AND DO YOU IT ALL OVER AGAIN. SO TO ME, THIS IS REALLY, REALLY IMPORTANT WHEN WE IMPLEMENT SOMETHING IN THE CITY. ALL RIGHT. WHAT I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT WAS OUR APPROACH. OUR APPROACH IS VERY HOLISTIC AND COMMUNITY FOCUSED AND I WILL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SOME OF THE STUFF WE ARE DOING LATER BUT WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE SOLUTIONS WE ARE PUT PUTTING IN, WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE DOING IT FOR THE COMMUNITY AND MAKING IT ALL INCLUSIVE FOR EVERYBODY. WE ARE NOT JUST DOING IT FOR A DEPARTMENT. WE ARE NOT JUST DOING IT FOR THE CITY. WE ARE DOING IT FOR A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE AT THE SAME TIME BECAUSE IT MAKES SENSE. SO THERE'S -- YOU KNOW, THIS SYSTEM IS VERY COMPLEX. THERE'S MANY STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED IN SMART CITIES. THERE'S A LOT OF MOVING PARTS TO IT TO ORGANIZE AND MAINTAIN SO THE OTHER THING WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE IS THAT IT ALIGNS WITH ALL OF OUR ORGANIZATIONAL STRATEGIES, LIKE OUR A.2 ZERO CLIMATE PLAN, OUR ONE COMMUNITY INITIATIVE, VISION ZERO. WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT THE OTHER DEPARTMENTS ARE DOING TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING IS COMPLYING WITH THA AND MAKES SU TT ITLIGNS WITH THO STRATEGIES AS W WELL. WE DON'T WANT TO GO OFF A DIFFERENT ROUTE. SO, YOU KNOW, THIS STRATEGIC PLAN IS CUSTOMIZED FOR ANN ARBOR. AND IT MUST CATER TO A HIGHER INFRASTRUCTURE. IN ANN ARBOR, A LOT OF MY PEERS AROUND THE COUNTRY AND DIFFERENT CITIES. LIKE I SAID, EVERY CITY IS DIFFERENT. SOME CITIES OWN EVERYTHING. THEY OWN THEIR ELECTRICITY. THEY OWN AND DELIVER THEIR ELECTRICITY, THEIR WATT, THEIR TRANSIT. THEIR PARKING. IN ANN ARBOR, WE OWN A LITTLE BIT HERE. WE CONTROL SOME THINGS AND WE DON'T CONTROL OTHER THINGS BUT WHAT THAT MEANS IS WE HAVE TO COLLABORATE WITH OTHER ENTITIES TO MAKE SURE WHEN WE DO SOMETHING, THAT WE ARE NOT STEPPING ON EACH OTHER'S TOES. SO THAT PRESENTS A LITTLE BIT OF A CHALLENGE HERE, BUT IT IS WHAT IT IS. AND I'M REALISTIC WHERE WE ARE AT. I'M NOT SHEER TO ASK FOR A BIG CAPCAPITAL SPEND. A LOT OF COMPONENTS HAVE BEEN PUT IN PLACE OVER THE YEARS IN CONJUNCTION WITH OTHER PROJECTS THAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING. WHAT THAT STRATEGY IS FOR IS THAT AS WE HAVE OPPORTUNITIES THAT COME UP. SO IF RAYMOND WANTS TO PUT MORE STREET LIGHT HEADS IN OR MOLLY WANTS TO MUTT PUT MORE RECYCLE S OR THERE'S SENSORS IN THE RIVER, WE HAVE THE FOUNDATION TO MAKE THAT STUFF POSSIBLE AND THAT'S WHAT THE GOAL OF THIS IS. WE HAVE A GOOD FOUNDATION. THERE'S VERY LITTLE BARRIERS TO STOP THEM FROM ACCOMPLISHING IT AND DOING IT. SO -- I ALREADY TALKED ABOUT -- IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT THE SYSTEMS THAT WE BUILD ARE SUSTAINABLE. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THEY ARE BUILT FOR THE LONG TERM, FOR THE FUTURE BECAUSE IF PEOPLE DON'T TRUST THE NETWORK, THEY ARE NOT GOING TO WANT TO USE THE NETWORK. AND SO WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING WE DO HAS A PLAN AND IT'S BEEN ARCHITECTED VERY CAREFULLY AND IT'S REALLY DESIGNED TO LAST -- SOME OF THE PRPROJECTS WHEN WE OPEN UP THE STREETS, THEY ARE DESIGNED TO LAST DECADES SO WE DON'T HAVE TO OPEN UP THE STREETS. IT'S REALLY FRUSTRATING, WHEN PEOPLE ARE OPENING UP THE STREET AND WE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO PUT SOMETHING UNDERGROUND. SO, WE'RE NOT LOOKING TO DO VANITY PROJECTS AND WE'RE NOT LOOKING TO DO STUFF JUST BECAUSE IT'S COOL. WE ARE LOOKING TO SOLVE PROBLEMS AND WE ARE LOOKING TO PUT SOLUTIONS IN THAT ADD REAL VALUE. AND THEN -- I'M SORRY. OUR BIG ONE STRATEGY IS VERY IMPORTANT. WE ONLY WANT TO OPEN UP GROUND ONCE. AND, AGAIN, IT NEEDS TO BE SCALABLE AND SUSTAINABLE. WHAT WE HAVE BUILT SO FAR AND WHAT WE ARE GOING TO BUILD JUST KEEPS BUILDING UPON ITSELF AND GETTING LARGER AND LARGER AND ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE MORE PEOPLE. SO THIS IS A PICTURE. IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE MUCH, BUT I DIDN'T PUT A LOT OF DETAIL ON THAT BECAUSE WE DON'T SHARE OUR FIBER MAPS -- WE DON'T SHARE OUR DETAILED FIBER MAPS WITH ANYBODY FOR SECURITY REASONS, BUT WHAT YOU SEE HERE IS ALL OF THE FIBER AND ALL THE CONDUIT WE HAVE GOING THROUGHOUT THE CITY. THIS IS THE MAIN FIBER AND COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK THAT ALLOWS ALL THE SMART CITY STUFF TO HAPPEN. AND YOU WILL NOTICE THAT IT'S PRETTY -- YOU KNOW, IT PRETTY MUCH COVERS THE WHOLE CITY. IN THE DOWNTOWN AREA, IN THE D.D.A. DISTRICT, WE HAVE A PROJECT COMING UP OVER THE NEXT YEAR AND A HALF THAT WILL PUT MORE FIBER AND CONDUIT IN THE DOWNTOWN AREA AND FIBER AND CONDUIT ESPECIALLY GOING THROUGH THE NEW HOUSING SITES. WE LOOK FORWARD THAT WE PLAN, WHEN WE DO THIS PROJECT, WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT WE PROVIDE FIBER AND CONDUIT AT THE FOOTSTEP OF THAT BUILDING TO GET COMMUNICATIONS INTO IT EARLY. AND THEN IN 2017, YOU KNOW, WE BUILT OUR FIRST NETWORK THAT CONNECTS ALL OF OUR BUILDINGS TOGETHER, OUR FIRST CITY NETWORK, AND THERE'S A THERE IS A NETWORK THAT CONTROLS ALL. TRAFFIC CONTROL SYSTEMS AND THEN WE ARE PLANNING TO DO A PROJECT. WE ARE WAITING FOR SOME FUNDINGG FROM THE E.D.A. TO PUT IN A MOBILITY CORRIDOR DOWN WASHTENAW AND BACK UP PACKARD AND GETTING BACK TO ANN ARBOR. AM I RUNNING OUT OF TIME?
01:41:00.266: >> Mayor Taylor: YOU ARE GETTING THERE.
01:41:02.502: >> ALL RIGHT. I WILL GO THROUGH REALLY QUICKLY WITH THIS, YOU KNOW, WITH DID SOME COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS IN THE COMMUNITY AND THEN A COUPLE OF ENGAGEMENT SESSIONS WITH THE COMMUNITY, AND CAME UP WITH THE GOALS THAT YOU SEE HERE AND THEY ARE ALSO IN THE PLAN. AND THESE ARE THE OBJECTIVES THAT WE ARE GOING TO ADDRESS. SO WE WANT TO BE THE MOST DESIRABLE CITY TO LIVE, WORK AND PLAY. AND WE WANT TO ENHANCE OUR ACTIVITIES WITH SMART CITY TECHNOLOGIES. WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT WE IMPROVE OUR TRANSPORTATION AND MOBILITY AND WE ARE BUILDING THE TECHNOLOGY PARK IN THE D.D.A. DISTRICT. WE WANT TO PROMOTE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND USING THESE TECHNOLOGIES FOR OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUILDINGS AND ALL OF OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING SITES ARE CONNECTED TO OUR NETWORK AND THEY WOULD CONTINUE TO BE WE WANT TO BRIDGE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. AND SO, YOU KNOW, DISTANCE LEARNING AND -- AND ACCESS IS IMPORTANT TO AFFORDABLE INTERNET AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE NOT ONLY ATTRACT NEW PEOPLE AND BUSINESSES BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE RETAIN THEM. WE DON'T WANT STUDENTS LEAVING. WE WANT THEM TO STAY HERE. WE DON'T WANT BUSINESSES LEAVING. WE WANT THEM TO STAY HERE IN THE CITY. AND NEXT ONE IS IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE. HAVING A SAFE COMMUNITY, WORKING WITH SAFETY SERVICES, GETTING THEM THE TECHNOLOGY TO KEEP US SAFE, HEALTHY AND ENVIRONMENTAL FRIENDLY COMMUNITY WORKING WITH O.S.I. ON ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES AND MAKING SURE THINGS ARE EQUITABLE AND INCLUSIVE. AND THEN THIS ONE IS JUST BASICALLY DISCIPLINED TELECOMMUNICATION STRATEGIES BUILT FOR THE LONG RUN, MAKING SURE WE GET TO A DATA DRIVEN CULTURE, CAPTURE THE DATA AND USE IT EFFECTIVELY ACROSS THE ORGANIZATION AND THEN BUILDING STRONG COMMUNITY RELATIONSHIPS MAKING SURE EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT IS GOING ON, MAKING SURE THEY HAVE ACCESS TO IT AND WE REALLY WANT TO USE THE ASSETS AS WE PUT THEM IN. AND I'M GOING TO KIND OF LEAVE IT AT THAT. AND LAST SLIDE, KEYS TO SUCCESS, BUILDING COMMUNITY TRUST, BUILD AND MAINTAIN A QUALITY, SUSTAINABLE AND SUSTAINABLE ECOSYSTEM. IT WILL CONTINUE TO GROW AND GROW. A SYSTEMIC APPROACH TOWARDS HOW WE DO IT. PROACTIVE AND EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE COMMUNITY, BREAKING DOWN SILOS IS A BIG ONE. WE STILL HAVE SILOS IN THE CITY THAT WE NEED TO TAKE CARE OF, AND THEN WE WANT FIBER TO BE TREATED AS CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE. I DON'T THINK IT GETS THE -- I DON'T THINK IT GETS AT TENSION THAT YOU NEED. BUT IF -- THE ATTENTION THAT YOU NEED. BUT IF YOU TAKE YOUR INTERNET CONNECTION WITH WAY, YOU WON'T LIKE IT. YOU KNOW, WE NEED IT AS A CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND IT FIELDS TO STAY UP AND RUNNING. SO -- AND THEN UTILIZATION OF DATA AND THE DATA SCIENCES IS REALLY KEY. SO I WENT -- I WENT A LITTLE FASTER THAN I HAD TO.
01:44:14.227: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU SO MUCH. WE'VE GOT AT LEAST ONE QUESTION. COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
01:44:19.699: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I ALWAYS ENJOY THESE I.T. PRESENTATIONS. ANOTHER ISSUE THAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT AND IS ACHIEVABLE WITH TECHNOLOGY WE HAVE TODAY IS THE MEANTIME FOR FAILURE OF STREETLIGHTS. AND SO I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT EMPLOYED. ALSO IN TERMS OF OUR EQUITY GOAL, RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT IF WE CAN BE PROACTIVE RATHER THAN COMPLAINT BASED IN TERMS OF VEGETATION OR STREETLIGHT OUTAGES, WE'RE GOING TO ACHIEVE OUR EQUITY GOAL BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE INTERACTING WITH OUR THE GOVERNMENT AND FEEL MORE EMPOWERED THAN OTHER PEOPLE DO. SO WE REALLY NEED TO BE PROACTIVE. AND THEN THE LAST QUESTION I HAVE AND MAYBE YOU CAN GIVE ME AN ANSWER AT A LATER TIME, WITH PEDESTRIAN CRASH DATA, CLOSE CALLS ARE VERY IMPORTANT. BUT THERE'S NO EASY WAY TO REPORT THAT, AND I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S ANY TECHNOLOGY THAT WOULD AID IN THAT? SO I WILL LET YOU THINK ABOUT THAT FOR A WHILE.
01:45:31.704: >> YEAH, YEAH. THAT ONE IS A TOUGHY. I'M SURE -- I'M SURE IT CAN BE ACHIEVED BUT THAT WOULD BE A TOUGH ONE.
01:45:39.645: >> Councilmember Griswold: THANKS.
01:45:41.814: >> YEAH, GOING BACK TO STREETLIGHTS -- WHAT'S THAT?
01:45:47.286: >> Mayor Taylor: I WAS GOING TO GO ON TO THE NEXT QUESTION.
01:45:49.422: >> OH, I'M SORRY. I WHAT GOING TO ADDRESS THE STREET LIGHT ISSUE. WHEN I SAID WE HAVE A HYBRID INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE CITY, THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE DON'T OWN ALL OF OUR STREETLIGHTS.
01:45:58.731: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I KNOW, YEAH.
01:46:00.500: >> SO WE CAN ONLY CONTROL WHAT WE OWN AND THEN WE HAVE TO RELY ON OTHER PEOPLE TO CONTROL THE REST OR WE HAVE TO OBTAIN THEM. AND IF WE CAN'T CONTROL 'EM, THEN IT'S KIND OF OUT OF OUR HANDS. YEAH.
01:46:11.811: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I AGREE.
01:46:14.213: >> Mayor Taylor: WE HAVE TWO QUESTIONS IN THE QUEUE. IS THERE A COUNCILMEMBER WHO HAS NOT ASKED A QUESTION TODAY WHO WISHES TO OPT IN BECAUSE WE DO HAVE -- WE ARE UNDER TIME PRESSURE. SEEING NONE, COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS AND RAMLAWI. THEN LET'S WRAP IT UP. THANK YOU WILL.
01:46:37.803: >> Councilmember Briggs: THANK YOU. GREAT TO HEAR WHAT'S HAPPENING AND OBVIOUSLY SMART CITIES ARE -- YOU KNOW, THERE'S SO MUCH EXCITING WORK THAT'S HAPPENING ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND IT'S ALL VERY INSPIRING. THIS IS MORE OF A COMMENT THAN A QUESTION OR PERHAPS A CAUTION FOR US A LITTLE BIT. I THINK AS WE MOVE TOWARDS EMPLOYING SORT OF SMART CITY TECHNOLOGY AND LIVING THAT WAY, YOU ALLUDED TO IT IN TERMS OF BEING COMMUNITY FOCUSED AND ENHANCING COMMUNITY SERVICES BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'M NOT SURE THAT WE ARE DOING ACTIVELY AS JUST EVALUATING AS WE MOVE TOWARDS NEW DEVICES AND TECHNOLOGY, WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT WE MIGHT BE LOSING WHEN WE MOVE AWAY FROM SORT OF THE OLD MODEL? SO FOR EXAMPLE, TECHNOLOGY IS REALLY GOOD AT FOCUSING IN ON ONE THING, AND DOING THAT REALLY WELL. AND GETTING US MUCH MORE INFORMATION, BUT SOMETIMES I THINK WE ALSO USE IT TO JUSTIFY JOBS IN OUR COMMUNITY AND SOMETIMES THOSE FOLKS THAT ARE DOING THAT WORK ARE DOING MANY THINGS. SO THE PERSON THAT'S GOING AND CHECKING, LOOKING FOR STREETLIGHT OUTAGES MAY BE OBSERVING A NUMBER OF OTHER ISSUES ALONG THE WAY OR THE PERSON WHO IS OPERATING OUR PARPARKING KIOSKS MAY HAVE BEEN GIVING DIRECTIONSO SOMEBODY IN THE COMMUTY ANDO I TNK AS WE THINK AUT ENHANCING OUR CITY SERVICES, PART OF THAT MAY BE NOT USING THIS EFFORT NECESSARILY TO ELIMINATE JOBS BUT ANYING ABOUT HOW DO THOSE PEOPLE GET USED DIFFERENTLY IN THE FUTURE TO ACTUALLY ENHANCE COMMUNITY SERVICES AND HOW DO WE DO THAT? AND OBVIOUSLY, WE'LL PROBABLY NEED MORE DATA ANALYSTS AS WELL.
01:48:16.769: >> YES, TO ME -- I MEAN, I DON'T SEE IT ELIMINATING JOBS. I SEE IT DOING JOBS AND IT ALWAYS GOES BACK TO THE CHALLENGES. WE IMPLEMENT THOSE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE NOT OVERSTEPPING OUR BOUNDS OR DOING SOMETHING THAT WE ARE DOING. THAT'S PART OF THE METHODOLOGY THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT. IT'S MAKING SURE THAT WE UNDERSTAND WHAT THE CUSTOMER WOULD WANT, WHICH IS OUR DEPARTMENTS, OUR CUSTOMERS BEING CITY DEPARTMENTS AND -- BUT, AGAIN, MOST OF THE -- I MEAN, I WOULD SAY THE MAJORITY OF THE TIME IT DOESN'T ELIMINATE JOBS IT. JUST MAKES EVERYBODY'S LIFE A LOT EASIER. SO -- THANK YOU.
01:49:03.215: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:49:05.217: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. I GUESS IT'S JUST MORE OF A COMMENT THAN A QUESTION. BUT PERHAPS YOU CAN ELABORATE ON IT WITH ALL THE CYBER ATTACKS THAT WE HAVE BEEN HEARING ABOUT RECENTLY, YOU KNOW, THE COLONIAL PIPELINE, J.D.S. MEAT PACKING, WE ARE SEEING MORE AND MORE SOPHISTICATED ATTACKS ON OUR TECHNOLOGY THAT ARE AFFECTING ORGANIZATIONS, LARGE ORGANIZATIONS FOR RANSOM. -- IF WE GO THIS DIRECTION OF BECOMING MORE AND MORE DEPENDENT ON TECHNOLOGY, WE BECOME MORE AND MORE VULNERABLE TO THESE KIND OF ATTACKS. WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY TO HELP EASE THE CONCERN ON THAT DEPENDENCY ON THAT VULNERABILITY?
01:49:53.766: >> YEAH, YOU KNOW, IT'S -- YOU KNOW, WE'RE VULNERABLE EVERY DAY. BUT, YOU KNOW, IT CERTAINLY EXISTS. SO I DIDN'T GET TO THE ONE SIDE WHERE I TALKED ABOUT CYBERSECURITY. CYBERSECURITY IS -- I MEAN, IT'S PREVALENT IN EVERYTHING WE DO TODAY, IT GETS WORSE AND WORSE EVERY DAY, BUT, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE DONE SOME THINGS TO SHARE AND DONE SOME THINGS TO MAKE CHANGES TO MAKE SURE THAT IF WE GET COMPROMISED, WE WILL GET COMPROMISED. IT'S JUST A MATTER OF HOW WE ARE ABLE TO RECOVER FROM BEING COMPROMISED. SO THE RISK IS THERE. THE RISK DOES INCREASE AS WE PUT MORE -- [ NO AUDIO ]
01:50:44.383: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I'M NOT HEARING ANYTHING.
01:50:47.286: >> City Admin. Crawford: I THINK HE WAS GOING TO SAY THE RISK INCREASES THE MORE DEVICES WE HAVE OUT THERE BUT WE HAVE PLANS AND STRATEGIES THAT WE TRY TO DO TO MITIGATE THAT RISK. IT'S A RISK THAT YOU CAN'T GET AWAY WITH, BUT YOU HAVE PLANS.
01:51:01.867: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  THE CONCERN IS THAT WE WILL HAVE MORE AND MORE DEPENDENT ON THIS AND WE WILL PUT MORE AND MORE INTO. THE COST AND THE CONSEQUENCE IS THAT JUST THAT MUCH GREATER AND I KNOW WE CAN'T QUANTIFY OR GET TO THE SOLUTION, BUT THAT'S AN ONGOING CONCERN.
01:51:23.489: >> City Admin. Crawford: THERE ARE DIFFERENT PROTOCOLS FOR MISSION CRITICAL ITEMS AND LESS CRITICAL. BUT YOUR POINT IS TAKEN THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE.
01:51:48.581: >> Mayor Taylor: I'M TRYING TO WRAP THINGS UP.
01:51:54.119: >> Councilmember Song: I WILL MAKE IT FAST. WE USE TWO AUTHENTICATION. I THINK WITH THE COLONIAL HACK, IT WAS A SINGLE PASSWORD.
01:52:06.198: >> City Admin. Crawford: WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF ROLLING OUT TWO FACTOR. WE DON'T USE IT UNIVERSALLY RIGHT NOW.
01:52:12.204: >> Councilmember Song: AND THEN WILL WE CONSIDER DOING OPEN DATA POLICING, LIKE NORTH CAROLINA, AND MARYLAND AND ILLINOIS, ON TRAFFIC STOPS OR IS THAT SOMETHING THAT'S PROBABLY MORE MANAGEABLE AT THE COUNTY LEVEL.
01:52:27.319: >> City Admin. Crawford: I WILL GET BACK TO YOU.
01:52:29.221: >> Councilmember Song: IT'S
