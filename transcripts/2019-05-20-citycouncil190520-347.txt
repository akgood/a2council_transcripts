00:02:25.864: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. NEXT SPEAKER IS JOHN MIRSK AYE. Y.
00:02:35.841: >> MY NAME IS JOHN MIRSKY. EYE LIVE AT 505BERSON PLACE. THEY ARE PASSIONATE, DEDICATED, HIGHLY COMPETENT AND LEADERS. THEY NOT ONLY ATTEND MONTHLY MEETING BUT ACCOMPLISH TREMENDOUS AMOUNT IN WORKING GROUP, ADVISORY COMMITTEES AND OR FORUMS. THEY DESERVE YOUR VOTES. SECONDLY, I HOPE THAT YOU CONTINUE TO PROVIDE FUNDS FOR DEER MANAGEMENT. I LIVE SIX BLOCKS FROM THE ARP. MY YARD AND MY NEIGHBORHOOD HAVE BEEN DECIMATED BY DEER. AS A RESULT OF THE CULL, THERE HAS BEEN A DRAMATIC REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF DEER WE SEE AND THE DAMAGE THEY INFLICT. FINALLY, I'M HERE TO ASK YOU THAT YOU SUPPORT OF THE CITY'S PROPOSED BUDGET WHICH ALIGNED WITH THE RESOLUTION YOU PASSED A FEW WEEKS AGO, FOR CLIMATE ACTION AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING, PEDESTRIAN BIKE SAFETY, MENTAL HEALTH AND OTHER UNDERFUNDED PRIORITIES. AS TO CLIMATE ACTION, ANN ARBOR FUNDING HAS ONLY BEEN $500,000 TO $600,000 PER YEAR SINCE ANN ARBOR'S CLIMATE ACTION PLAN WAS PASSED IN 2012. NOT $1 TO $2 MILLION AS SOME HAVE STATED. YOU INCREASED IT RECENTLY BY $250,000 BY FISCAL YEAR '19 WITH A ONE-TIME SPECIAL BUDGET APPROPRIATION. TWO BUDGET AMENDMENTS YOU WILL CONSIDER THIS EVENING, PUT PART OF THE ADDITIONAL $880,000 IN NEW PROGRAM SPENDING FOR CLIMATE ACTION AT RISK. THE FIRST PROPOSES TO SHIFT MONEY TO ADDITIONAL POLICING, AND THE SECOND FOR PENSION FUNDING. FOR THE PUBLIC RECORD, ANN ARBOR ALREADY SPENDS $29 MILLION ON POLICING. SINCE 2000, OUR SERIOUS CRIME IS DOWN 30%, AND OUR PROPERTY CRIME IS DOWN 45%.AT'S BETTER TL TRENDS, MOREOVER, OUR CRIME RATES ARE FAR BELOW NATIONAL AND STATE LEVELS. MORE IMPORTANTLY, VIRTUALLY ALL OF OUR CITIZENS FEEL SAFE AS REFLECTED IN ANN ARBOR'S NATIONAL CITIZEN SURVEY RESULTS. WE DO NOT HAVE A CRIME CRISIS IN ANN ARBOR. WITH RESPECT TO PENSIONS, ANN ARBOR'S LIABILITY IS 86% FUNDED, UP FROM 80% IN 2013. MOREOVER, THE CITY'S BOND RATING IS DOUBLE A.A. PLUS. ADDITIONAL FUNDS ARE ALREADY IN THE BASE FISCAL YEAR '20/21 BUDGET. I SUBMIT ANN ARBOR DOES NOT HAVE A PENSION CRISIS. IN CONTRAST, WE ARE FACING A CLIMATE CRISIS. IT IS THREATENING THE FOUNDATION OF OUR ECONOMIES, LIVELIHOODS, FOOD SECURITY, HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE AS WELL AS THE NATURAL ECOSYSTEMS UPON WHICH WE ARE DEPENDENT. ACTION IS REQUIRED GLOBALLY, LO. AS A WEALTHY COMMUNITY WHICH HAS HIGHER PER CAPITA GREEN HOUSE GAS EMISSIONS, ANN ARBOR NEEDS TO DO ITS SHARE TO REDUCE THE EMISSIONS. THE PROPOSED PROJECTS AND PROGRAMS IN THE BUDGET START TO DO THAT. THANK YOU. [ APPLAUSE ]
00:05:35.680: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS GLENN NELSON.
00:05:45.857: >> HI, GLENN NELSON, COCHAIR OF CITIZENS FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND PUBLIC SAFETY. OUR LEADERSHIP SUPPORTS THE PORTIONS OF THE PROPOSED BUDGET INCORPORATING THE COMPROMISED SOLUTION RELATED TO THE USE OF THE MENTAL HEALTH AND PUBLIC SAFETY MILLAGE FUNDS, AS COMPROMISED, THE SOLUTION DOES NOT REFLECT EVERYTHING WE DESIRED BUT WE RECOGNIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF COMPROMISE. WE ESPECIALLY APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OF COUNCILMEMBERS COUNS BANNISTER, EATEN, GRISWOLD, LUMM, AND   RAMLAWI, EVEN THOUGH YOUR LEFT TO OVERRIDE THE MAYOR'S VETO SHARED, YOU SHOWED THAT A MAJORITY OF THET SUPPORTH SERVICES AND THUS YOU PROVIDED THE FOUNDATION FOR THE INCLUSION OF THESE SERVICES IN THE BUDGET. I HAVE TWO CONCERNS WITH BUDGET AMENDMENT 7. FIRST, ITS ENACTMENT WOULD PLACE A HEAVIER BURDEN OF PENSION COSTS ON THE MENTAL HEALTH AND PUBLIC SAFETY MILLAGE THAN OTHER FUNDS. I BEGAN TO LOOK AT THE CITY'S PENSION POLICY ONLY ONE DAY TO GO. IF I MAKE ERRORS, I WILL APPRECIATE CORRECTIONS IN YOUR DISCUSSION OF THE AMENDMENT. FIRST, THE CITY HAS A PENSION POLICY ADOPTED BY THE   COUNCIL. SECOND, ASSUMING IMPOLITICALMENTATION OF THE -- IMPLEMENTATION OF THE POLICY, THE ALLOCATION OF THE FUNDS TO THE ACCOUNT, PAYROLL FRINGES INCLUDES THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNTS FOR PENSIONS. THUS, WHEN MILLAGE FUNDS OR MONIES THAT REFLECT MILLAGE REVENUES ARE ALLOCATED IN THE ADMINISTRATOR'S RECOMMENDED BUDGET TO A SERVICE UNIT, THE EXPENDITURE BUDGET INCLUDES AN ALLOCATION TO PENSIONS. IF THE AMENDMENT PASSES, 10% OF THE FUNDS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MILLAGE WOULD COME OFF THE TOP TO THE MENTION FUND. THEN AN ADDITIONAL AMOUNT FROM THE REMAINING 90% OF THE MILLAGE FUNDS WOULD GO TO THE PENSION FUND THROUGH THE PATH OF THE STANDARD ALLOCATION TO PAYROLL FRINGES. THE MILLAGE WOULD BEAR HIGHER RELATIVE CONTRIBUTION, WHICH WOULD BE UNFAIR TO MOST OF US. SECOND, IF THE COUNCIL PASSES AMENDMENT SEVEN, THE MANY PEOPLE WHO THOUGHT THEY WERE VOTING FOR INCREASED MENTAL HEALTH AND PUBLIC SAFETY SERVICES, WHEN THEY VOTED FOR THE MILLAGE AND THEN FIND FUNDS BEING USED TO PAY FOR RETIREMENT BENEFITS FOR CITY EMPLOYEES WILL BE FURTHER UPSET AND DISILLUSIONED WITH CITY POLICY. IN THE COUNCIL DESIRES TO REDUCE THE UNFUNDED MENTION LIABILITY, THE PREFERRED APPROACH WOULD BE TO REVISE THE MENTION POLICY. -- THE PENSION POLICY.
00:08:49.337: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. [ APPLAUSE ] OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS GRANT SHAFER.
00:08:57.846: >> GOOD EVENING.
00:09:00.014: >> COUNCIL HAS APPROPRIATED $250,000 FOR THE 2019/2020 DEER KILL. I SUPPORT COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER'S RESOLUTION TO DEFUND THE KILL. THERE MAY SOMEBODY COUNCILMEMBERS AND CITIZENS WHO DO NOT KNOW THAT THE THREE REASONS YOU USED TO JUSTIFY THE KILL, DISEASE, TRAFFIC, SAFETY, AND PLANT DESTRUCTION ARE MISTAKEN. WASHTENAW CITIZENS FOR ECOLOGICAL BALANCE, HAS RAISED THE SPECTER OF CHRONIC WASTING DISEASE AND LYME DISEASE TO JUSTIFY THE KILLING. CHRONIC WASTING DISEASE, CWD IS NOT KNOWN TO INFECT HUMANS, BUT THE SUREST WAY TO AVOID IT IS NOT TO EAT VENISON. WHICH MAKES THE DONATION OF CULLED VENISON TO FOOD BANKS BY THIS CITY UNETHICAL. BAITING DEER, AS THE CITY HAS BEEN DOING AS PART OF THE CULL FOR THE LAST THREE WINTERS CAN SPREAD CWD BY BRINGING DEER TOGETHER AT BAIT PILES. THE DEER TICK IS THE VECTOR OF LYME DISEASE. WHILE DEER CAN HOST THE TICK, ANY MAMMAL AND EVEN LIZARDS WILL DO. TICK POPULATIONS SOMETIMES INCREASE IN THE ABSENCE OF DEER. FURTHER, THE VAUNTED CORNELL STUDY AND ITS AUTHOR BERN BLOSSY ADMITS THAT LYME DISEASE INCREASED 1,089% DURING THEIR KILL. DEER-VEHICLE COLLISIONS, DVCs IN WASHTENAW COUNTY ARE REPORTED BY MOTORISTS WITHOUT VERIFICATION BY THE POLICE. THE CORNELL REPORT REPORTS THAT DVCs INCREASED DURING DEER KILL. I APPLAUD COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD'S EFFORTS FOR PEDESTRIAN SAFETY, BUT I DEPLORE HER SUPPORT FOR THE DEER KILL. MOTOR VEHICLES KILL MORE PEDESTRIANS AND CYCLISTS THAN DEER. SHE HAS NOT PUBLISHED A PEERIVE REVIEWED STUDY IN THE LAST 28 YEARS AND WAS SOCIALLY LINKED WITH WAC4A. FURTHER NEAR MY HOME, DEER CULL EXIST WITH A THRIVING FOREST UNDERSTORY AND ABUNDANT TRILLIUM. THE CORNELL STUDY COULD NOT DECIDE IF DEER EXTERMINATION DECREASED ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE. THE CITY'S DEER EXTERMINATOR, WHITE BUFFALO, BLAMES PROTESTERS FOR THE FAILURE TO MEET CONTRACTUAL GOALS. DISHONESTY AND CRUELTY IN WHITE BUFFALO PAINT, $17,500 IN 2013. THE ANN ARBOR DEER KILL HAS BEEN INTRODUCED AND CONDUCTED IN SECRET AND DISHONESTY AS FOIAED EMAILS BETWEEN COUNCILMEMBER LUMM AND WAC FORBES GARDENS. THANK YOU.
00:12:05.262: >> Mayor Taylor: THE NEXT SPEAKER IS MARGARET LEARY.
00:12:15.073: >> GREETINGS. I WANT TO BEGIN BY THANKING COUNCIL, VERY, VERY MUCH AND THANKING STAFF, VERY, VERY MUCH FOR CARRYING OUT AN EFFECTIVE DEER MANAGEMENT PROGRAM, FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. I'M HERE TO SPEAK AGAINST AMENDMENT 6 WHICH WOULD END THAT PROGRAM. THE AMENDMENT CONTAINS ITS OWN REASONS AND FIRST, AMONG THE REASONS IS THAT THE PROGRAM IS, QUOTE, CONTROVERSIAL TO LARGE SEGMENTS OF THE COMMUNITY. THE FACT IS THAT SURVEYS ABOUT THE PROGRAM SHOW 75% APPROVAL ACROSS ALL FIVE WARDS AND THAT WAS THE MEASUREMENT THAT THE CITY SET UP. SECOND IN THE AMENDMENT IS COST, $150,000 ONE YEAR AND $100,000 THE NEXT YEAR IS A TEENSY AMOUNT OF A $430 MILLION BUDGET. IRONICALLY FOLLOWERS OF THE PROGRAM IS INCREASED THE COST OF THE PROGRAM. THE CONTRACTOR'S MARCH RECORD WHICH I COMMEND TO ALL OF YOU, IF YOU HAVEN'T READ IT THOROUGHLY, IT CONTAINS TONS OF FACTS. THE CONTRACTOR'S MARCH REPORT DESCRIBES REDUCED OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES AND INCREASED OVERALL COST PER DEER THAT WERE CAUSED BY DIRECT INTERFERENCE WITH SHARPSHOOTING OPERATIONS. ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS A SMALL GROUP OF PROTESTORS PREVENTED DEER FROM GOING TO SHARP SHOOTING LOCATIONS AND THEY CONTAMINATED BAIT SITES AND ONE SITE WAS CLOSED DUE TO CONSISTENT HARASSMENT BY PROTESTORS. ALL OF THIS INCREASED THE COST PER DEER OF THE DEER -- OF THE DEER MANAGEMENT. THIRD, DENIAL OF ACCESS TO PUBLIC PARKS. THE CITY HAS ADDRESSED THIS BY REDUCING THE HOURS OF CLOSURE AND THE NUMBER OF PARKS AFFECTED. THE PARKS ARE CLOSED FOR SAFETY, OBVIOUSLY. FOURTH, THE USE OF FIREARMS WITHIN THE CITY LIMITS AND PROXIMITY TO RESIDENTIAL DWELLINGS. THIS IMPLIES THERE'S WRONG WITH THE WAY THE CULL WAS CONDUCTED AND THERE ISN'T. THE CITY AND THE CONTRACTOR COMPLIED WITH ALL RELEVANT LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND ALL NATIONAL SAFETY STANDARDS. THERE HAVE BEEN ZERO INCIDENTS OF HARM TO PEOPLE OR PETS. FIFTH, OTHER MORAL DILEMMAS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THOSE COULD BE. THE CONTRACTOR USES THE RELEVANT NATIONAL VETERINARY MEDICINE ASSOCIATION GUIDELINES FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF ANIMALS WHICH I ASSUME THE HUMANE SOCIETY USES TOO. THE STATE PERMITS THE APRILUAL KILLING -- ANNUAL KILLING OF 370,000 DEER EVERY YEAR AS ITS MAJOR MANAGEMENT TOOL CALLED HUNTING. I DO SEE PAY MORAL DILEMMA IN FAVOR OF ONE SPECIES, HUGE DEER, OVER ALL OTHER SPECIES. DEER CAN WIPE OUT WOODLANDS, REMOVING HABITAT AND FOOD FOR MANY OTHER SPECIES. I SEE A MORAL AND LEGAL DILEMMA IN DIRECT INTERFERENCE WITH THE CITY CONTRACTOR'S LEGAL CULL VIOLATING A STATE LAW AND VIOLATING TAX DOLLARS. THE 2018 REPORT IS FULL OF THE QUANTIFICATION, GOALS WERE SET AND GOALS WERE MET. THE PROGRAM IS TERRIFIC AND I HOPE YOU CONTINUE IT.
00:15:19.424: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. THE NEXT SPEAKER IS ROBERT McGEE.
00:15:32.738: >> TON WE WOULD LIKE TO GIVE SUPPORT TO THE BUDGET AMENDMENT MANAGEMENT.DEFEND DEER AS YOU CONTEMPLATE YOUR VOTE, PLEASE CONSIDER THE CONTROVERSY. YOU HEARD ABOUT RESIDENTS PROTESTING AND THE VENDOR STATING THAT HE CANNOT SHOOT DEER WITH PROTESTERS AROUND. THE PROTESTS ARE INCREASING SO NOW THERE'S TALK ABOUT HAVING PEACEFUL PROTESTERS ARRESTED EVEN THOUGH THEY REMAIN ON PUBLIC SIDEWALKS. AND WHY ARE WE SHOOTING DEER ON PRIVATE PROPERTY? IF I HAVE A RACCOON IN MY ATTIC, I DON'T EXPECT THE CITY TO PAY FOR ITS REMOVAL. YOU HAVE HEARD FROM NUMEROUS EXPERTS FOR AND AGAINST SHOOTING DEER IN THE CITY LIMITS. YOU ARE WARNED BY THE HUMANE SOCIETY OF HURON VALLEY AND THE HUMANE OF THE UNITED STATES, ON    OU SHOOT DEER, YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO STOP IT. YOU HAVE HEARD THE CLAIMS THAT IS BEING DRIVEN BY A SELECT FEW AND THE CITY DOESN'T CARE ABOUT OTHER'S VOICES. REMEMBER CEDAR BEND? IN 2017, AT LEAST SEVEN PEOPLE STOOD HERE AND PLEADED WITH YOU TO LEAVE THE DEER ALONE. THE RESULT, ONLY ONE DEER WAS STERILIZED ON CEDAR BEND AND DAYS LATER, 14 FEMALES WERE SHOT, 200 FEET AWAY. WHY? BECAUSE THE PROGRAM CONCENTRATED EFFORTS IN WARD TWO. THE METRICS. LET'S TALK ABOUT DEER-VEHICLE ACCIDENTS. THE GOAL IS TO MAKE THE NUMBER LESS THAN 40. WHO IS ODD IS THE CITY IS INCLUDING ALL THE DEER ACCIDENTS ON THE EXPRESSWAYS THAT SURROUND ANN ARBOR, BUT WE ARE ONLY SHOOTING DEER IN WARDS 1 AND 2. HOW DOES SHOOTING A DEER IN WARD 1 REDUCE THE NUMBER OF ACCIDENTS OUT ON I-94? WE WILL NEVER ACHIEVE THAT METRIC, NEVER! IN THE 2019 MSU SURVEY, 73.3% STATED THAT THE AMOUNT OF DEER DAMAGE WAS ACCEPTABLE. THE COSTS, YEAR-TO-DATE THE CITY HAS SPENT APPROXIMATELY $750,000 TO DEAL WITH THIS CONTROVERSIAL ISSUE. THE RESULT, AFTER FOUR YEARS, 78 DEER SOUTHEASTERLESED -- STERILIZED AND 380 SHOT. NOW YOU ARE LOOKING AT SPENDING $2,540,000 MORE AND WHAT WILL YOU GET? SAY ANOTHER 100 DEER PER YEAR? NO MATTER HOW YOU SPIN IT, THE RESULT   IS $1,250 TO SHOOT ONE DEER. THIS STARTED AS A FOUR-YEAR PROJECT AND NOW IT'S SIX YEARS. WHEN WILL IT STOP? ACCORDING TO WHITE BUFFALO'S REPORTS THEY ARE SHOOTING AN AVERAGE OF 50% OF THE FEMALES EACH YEAR. GET IT? YOU WILL BE SHOOTING 100 DEER PER YEAR INDEFINITELY. LEARN TO LIVE WITH THEM, OTHERS DO. YOU SAY YOU WANT MORE POLICE, YOU SAY YOU WANT MONEY FOR CLIMATE ACTION AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WELL, HERE'S YOUR CHANCE TO SAVE $125,000 PER YEAR BY ENDING THIS NIGHTMARE NOW. [ APPLAUSE ]
00:18:24.338: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. YOUR NEXT SPEAKER IS BERNIE
00:18:31.443: >> MAYOR TAYLOR, MEMBERS OF COUNCIL, I'M BERNIE BANET. HEATHERWAY HOMEOWNER SINCE 1975, A SECOND WARD, I ASK THIS EVENING WHAT HAPPENS IF BUDGET AMENDMENT 6, ZEROING OUT THE DEER MANAGEMENT BUDGE ELIMINATE PASSES AND ANN ARBOR'S EXEMPLARY AND EFFECTIVE DEER MANAGEMENT PROGRAM IS ENDED? WE CAN PREDICT THE CONSEQUENCES. THE CITY NOT ONLY STOPS CONTROLLING THE DEER HERD. IT ALSO CEASES TO COLLECT INFORMATION ABOUT HOW MANY DEER THERE ARE, AND WHERE THEY ARE LOCATED. WE STOPPED DOING SURVEYS OF RESIDENT'S OPINIONS TO FIND OUT WHERE THE CONFLICTS ARE OCCURRING. WE STOPPED MONITORING THE DEER BROWSE. WE NO LONGER KNOW WHEN THE SUSTAINABILITY OF THE WOODLAND OR PRAIRIE ECOSYSTEM IN A GIVEN PARK IS IN SERIOUS DANGER FROM OVER ABUNDANT DEER. AS AMENDMENT 6 TAKES, THE DEER POPULATION INEVITABLY CLIMBS. WE SEE A RISE, REVERSING THE DOWNWARD TREND IN THE CULL YEARS. PERHAPS SOON PASSING THE PRECULL PEAK OF 90 DEER CRASHES PROSECUTE YEAR. NOW THERE'S VEGETATION DESTRUCTION ALONG, BUT EVENTUALLY, THE DEER HEARD DOES REACH A POINT WHERE POPULATION GROWTH STALLS, BECAUSE THEY ARE REALLY EATING THEMSELVES OUT OF HOUSE AND HOME, BY THEN THE STARVING DEER LEAVE FEW PLANTS INTACT AND, OF COURSE, SUFFER FROM THE HUNGER. WITH LYME DISEASE NOW KNOCKING ON THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR'S DOOR, A DENSE DEER POPULATION ACCELERATION THE SPREAD OF TICK SPECIES THAT CARRIES THE DISEASE BY PROVIDING THEM WITH READILY AVAILABLE REPRODUCTIVE HOSTS. AMENDMENT 6 LEAVES ANN ARBOR NO EFFECTIVE WAY TO CONTROL ITS DEER POPULATION. IT DENIES THE REALITY THAT DEER MANAGEMENT IS AN ONGOING NEED WHEN LETHAL CULLS ARE BECOMING AN ANNUAL ACTIVITY IN THE CITIES AND THE SUBURBS AROUND NORTH AMERICA. MUCH AS ANNUAL HUNTING SEASONS ARE USED ON A LARGE SCALE TO CONTROL THE DEER POPULATION IN THE MORE RURAL AREAS. THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THOUGH THE DEER MANAGEMENT PROGRAM ELIMINATION WOULD SAVE SOME MONEY IN THE SHORT RUN, EVERYTIME, IT WOULD GREATLY HARM ONE OF THE ANN ARBOR'S PRIME ASSETS, ITS NATURAL AREAS AND WILL ALSO POSE A THREAT TO THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE RESIDENTS. AMENDMENT 6 IS A TERRIBLE IDEA. [ APPLAUSE ]
00:21:51.242: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS KRISTINE OLSSON.
00:22:00.849: >> THANK YOU. MY NAME IS CHRIS OLSSON AND I'M REPRESENTING THE WASHTENAW COUNTY CHAPTER OF THE CITY CLIMATE LOBBY AND THE CLIMATE REALITY PROJECT. AND I'M   GLAD THAT ANN ARBOR HS BEEN MAKING PROGRESSIVE COMMITMENTS TO ADDRESS THE CLIMATE CRISIS BY HAVING A CLIMATE ACTION PLAN, BY MAKING 100% COMMITMENT TO RENEWABLE ENERGY, AND BY FUNDING ITS OFFICE OF SUSTAINABILITY THROUGH THE 2017 COUNTY MILLAGE. I AM FINDING IT HARD TO UNDERSTAND THE DIFFICULTY WE SEEM TO BE HAVING ACTUALLY TAKING ACTION ON THE CLIMATE CRISIS, HOWEVER, AND YOUR CONSTITUENTS SEEM TO NEED TO KEEP COMING BACK TO YOU AND ASK FOR FUNDING. I   MEAN, WE ARE QUIBBLING OVER SOME THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FOR PREVENTING THE EXISTENTIAL AND COSTLIEST CRISIS FROM OUR TIME. SO ASH   AIR POLLUTION KILLS MOE PEOPLE EVERY YEAR THAN THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC OR CAR ACCIDENTS. MICHIGAN AND OUR NEIGHBORING STATES ARE PROJECTED TO INCUR SOME OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE TO OUR ROADS AND BRIDGES MOSTLY DUE TO INCREASED FLOODING WITH COSTS PROJECTED TO EXCEED $6 BILLION BEFORE THE END OF THE CENTURY. MDOT HAS SAID THE STATE HAS REQUESTED EMERGENCY RELIEF FUNDS NINE TIMES TOTALING $47 MILLION IN RECENT YEARS. WE CAN'T AFFORD TO DO NOTHING. IN FACT, TURNING TO CLEAN ENERGY WOULD ACTUALLY SAVE US MONEY. IT WOULD SAVE FAMILIES $150 IN ENERGY COSTS AND $2,000 IN HEALTH COSTS. EVERY YEAR,. THE ADMINISTRATOR'S CURRENT BUDGET IS A GOOD START FOR ANN ARBOR TO MOVE FORWARD ON THESE ISSUES AND I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT IT. U.S., OVER 90 CITIES, MORE THAN 10 COUNTIES AND TWO STATES HAVE ADOPTED 100% CLEAN ENERGY GOALS JUST LIKE ANN ARBOR HAS. SIX CITIES, ASPEN, BURLINGTON, GEORGETOWN, GREENSBERG, ROCKPORT AND KODIAK ISLAND HAVE ALREADY HIT THEIR TARGETS. THEY NOW GENERATE 100% OF THE ENERGY USED COMMUNITY-WISE FROM CLEAN ENERGY. GRAND RAPIDS IS ON TRACK THE 10T YEARS FROM NOW CITY NEXT YEAR. THIS THESE POLITICALLY AND CULTURALLY VERY DIFFERENT GOVERNMENTS CAN DO IT, SO CAN PROGRESS ENVIRONMENT ANN ARBOR. PLEASE PUT ASIDE POLITICAL SITUATIONS. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE OF OUR TIME AND WE OWE IT TO OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO ADDRESS IT. IF WE DON'T GET MOVING ON IT NOW, IT WILL BE TOO LATE. THANK     YOU.
00:24:35.824: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. [ APPLAUSE ] OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS WAYNE APPLEYARD.
00:24:47.369: >> GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE. I'M THE CURRENT CHAIR OF THE ANN ARBOR ENERGY COMMISSION, AND I'M ASKING YOU TO VOTE AGAINST BUDGET AMENDMENTS 3 AND 7 THAT WOULD TOGETHER REDUCE SUSTAINABILITY AND CLIMATE ACTION FUNDING BY OVER 20%. AMENDMENT 3 ASKS FOR MORE POLICE STAFF WHEN CRIME IN ANN ARBOR IS DOWN BY 30%. AMENDMENT 7 DOESES FOR ALLOCATING FUNDS TO THE PENSION FUND FOR SOME POSSIBLE FUTURE SHORTFALL THAT MAY HAPPEN IF ECONOMIC PREDICTIONS, WHICH ARE PROBABLY WORSE THAN IN -- IN THEIR ABILITY TO PREDICT THAN CLIMATE CHANGE FUTURES. WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF A CLIMATE CRISIS. AND HOW QUICKLY WE DEAL WITH THAT CRISIS WILL AFFECT THE QUALITY OF LIFE ON THIS PLANET FOR MANY GENERATIONS TO COME. GRETA THERNBURG TOLD THE IPCC THAT THEY NEEDED TO TREAT THE CLIMATE CRISIS AS IF THEIR HOUSE WAS ON FIRE, BECAUSE IT IS. THE OFFICE OF SUSTAINABILITY AND INNOVATION IS OUR LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT AGAINST CLIMATE -- THE CLIMATE CRISIS. CUTTING THE BUDGET IS LIKE TELLING THE FIRE DEPARTMENT TO ONLY FIGHT SOME OF THE HOUSE FIRES AND LET THE REST BURN. I SAT HERE ON MAY 6th, WHEN THE BUDGET PUBLIC HEARING TOOK PLACE, AND ONLY ONE PERSON SPOKE AND IT WASN'T AGAINST THE OSI FUNDING. EARLIER THE DIVERSION OF CLIMATE FUNDS TO THE SURVEY REQUESTED ITEMS HAD BEEN RESOLVED, WHEN ADDITIONAL FUNDING BECAUSE FOUND FOR THOSE OTHER NEEDS. SO I ASSUMED THAT THE CLIMATE■■ FUNDING WAS SECURE AND DIDN'T LENGTHEN THAT LONG MEETING BY SPEAKING IN FAVOR OF THE FUNDING. I GUESS SHOWING UP ISN'T ALWAYS ENOUGH AND ONE HAS TO SPEAK UP AS WELL. I SAT HERE ON MAY 13th, WHEN DR. STULTS PRESENTED HER EXCELLENT THOROUGH AND AMBITIOUS FIVE-YEAR PLAN AND ONLY HEARD A FEW QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE ENERGY DISCLOSURE ORDINANCE FROM COUNCILMEMBERS. NO ONE ASKED HER IF SHE COULD USE MORE FUNDS. HER BUDGET SEEMED SECURE. THE LEAVEAGING OF FUNDS FOR HER -- THE LEVERAGING OF FUNDS FOR HER OUTCOMES IS REMARKABLE IN HER BUDGET, AND HER BUDGET SHOULD BE FUNDED IF NOT INCREASED. LAST WEEK, COUNCILMEMBERS WERE ASKED ABOUT POSSIBLE CHARGES IN -- CHANGES IN THE BUDGET AND WERE TOLD THAT A LITTLE TWEAKING MIGHT TAKE PLACE. BUT NOTHING SUBSTANTIAL. YESTERDAY, I FOUND OUT THAT THE BUDGET AMENDMENTS WOULD BE DECREASING THE OSI BUDGET BY MORE THAN 20%. 20% IS MORE THAN JUST A TWEAK. BEFORE THE MILLAGE REBATE APPEARED, THE COMMUNITY HAD PROPOSED TO COUNCIL TO SPEND $1.2 MILLION TO COMBAT CLIMATE CRISIS. BUT FUNDING WAS NOT FOUND. IT'S IMPORTANT TO REALIZE THAT THE $880,000 THAT THE OSI -- THANK YOU.
00:27:53.757: >> YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS JAN DAVIES-McDERMOTT.
00:28:02.327: >> GOOD EVENING, MAYOR TAYLOR, AND COUNCIL. MY NAME IS JAN DAVIES-McDERMOTT. I HAVE BEEN A 40-YEAR RESIDENTS AT 1355 KING GEORGE IN ANN ARBOR. I'M A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER HERE IN ANN ARBOR SINCE 1994. I HOLD APRIL EXPIRING TERM POSITION ON THE ANN ARBOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COMMISSION. I WAS APPOINTED BY MAYOR HEFTA AND WHEN I LISTENED TO THE LAST COUNCIL REPLAY, I HEARD THE COUNCIL'S REQUEST TO MEET SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING APPOINTED TO COMMISSIONS:  SO HERE I AM. I'M SEEKING A REAPPOINTMENT TO THE ANN ARBOR DEVELOPMENT COMMISSION TO CONTINUE FORWARD PROGRESS ON THE COMMISSION, WHICH SUPPORTS THE ECONOMIC GROWTH OF ANN ARBOR, WITH A PRIMARY FOCUS ON SUPPORTING NONPROFITS AND MANUFACTURING WITH ACCESS TO CAPITAL FOR BUSINESSES THAT WOULD NOT NORMALLY OR OTHERWISE RECEIVE INTEREST FROM OTHER TYPES OF VENTURE CAPITAL FINANCING. WE HAVE BEEN EXPLORING NEW ROLES OF SERVICE POTENTIALS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE NOBODIES ACT AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE S.E.C. REGULATIONS BY WAY OF RAISING EQUITY. THE RULES AND THE AREAS MOBILITY IN TRANSIT, ATTRACTING AND RETAINING A WORKFORCE, AND THE TALENT THAT IS HERE, ENCOURAGING OFFICE AND MODERATE RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT,ISM PROVING THE BUSINESS CLIMATE AND IMPROVING CITY SERVICES, SUCH AS WASTE DISPOSAL, AND WATER QUALITY, AND THE QUALITY OF LIFE, SUCH AS THE CURRENT GREENWAY PROJECT. WHY ME? I'M A VOLUNTEER AT HEART. I SERVE ON TWO NONPROFIT BOARDS, THE WOMEN'S CENTER OF SOUTHEAST MICHIGAN AND THE ATHENA LEADERS THE HURON VALLEY WHERE I'M CHAIR. AND I ALSO SERVE ON THE ATHENA INTERNATIONAL BOARD. AS FOR THE CITY GOES, I AM A PRECINCT COCHAIR, AND AN ELECTION INSPECTOR. AND I HOPE TO BE REAPPOINTED, MAYOR TAYLOR, TO CONTINUE TO SERVE. THANK YOU.
00:30:24.436: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. [ APPLAUSE ] ARE THERE COMMUNICATIONS TODAY FROM COUNCIL? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
00:30:32.577: >> Councilmember Hayner:  MR. M. FIRST THANKS GO TOUT TO MS. DAVIES-McDERMOTT FOR COMING DOWN AND SPEAKING TO US TONIGHT. I REALLY THANK YOU FOR DOING THAT. WITH SEVERAL HUNDRED PEOPLE SERVING ON BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS, DOZENS OF BOARDS AN COMMISSIONS, IT'S OUTSIDE OF READING THE MINUTES, IT'S DIFFICULT TO KNOW WHAT'S ALWAYS HAPPENING AND SO YOUR SUMMARY WAS MOST WELCOMED AND APPRECIATED. I SINCERELY MEAN THAT. SECONDLY, I GOT A -- YOU KNOW, WE GOT A LOT OF CORRESPONDENCE FROM THE RESIDENTS ABOUT BUDGET ISSUES IN THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS, AND SOME OF THEM WERE JUST SORT OF -- SORT OF INTERESTING IN THE WAY THAT THEY CHARACTERIZED THE BUDGET AMENDMENT PROCESS     HERE. AND SO WE DON'T -- WE GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS. WE TURN OUR AMENDMENTS IN. THEY ARE VETTED BY STAFF. WE WORK WITH STAFF AND THEY ARE VETTED BY STAFF AND THEN THEY ARE PUBLISHED ENMASS LIKE. THIS I THINK IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT THE WAY THE PROCESS IS SET UP NOW, IS THAT THESE AMENDMENTS COME OUT AFTER THE PUBLIC HEARING ON THE BUDGET AND I THINK A LOT OF FOLKS IN THE COMMUNITY WOULD HAVE LOVED TO HAVE THESE AMENDMENTS COME OUT PRIOR TO LAST WEEK. ONLY ONE PERSON SPOKE AT IT. IT WAS SHOCKING THAT ONLY ONE PERSON WAS HERE. I THINK THAT SPEAKS TO THE LACK OF NOTICE AND ALSO THE ACCEPTANCE THAT OUR BUDGET IS PRETTY DECENT OVERALL. AND SO I'M NOT SURE WE CAN DO BOTH MOVING FORWARD, BUT I THINK THERE'S A PROBLEM WHERE ALL OF A SUDDEN THERE'S APRIL IDEA THAT SOMETHING IS UNDERHANDED OR LAST MINUTE AND IT'S JUST THE WAY WE ARE TOLD TO DO IT. I APOLOGIZE THAT THESE THINGS COME OUT LIKE THIS ON THE FRIDAY PRIOR TO THE HEARING, BUT IT'S -- MAYBE OUR ADMINISTRATOR OR YOU ARE RULES COMMITTEE COULD TALK ABOUT THAT IN THE FUTURE AND SEE IF THERE'S SOMETHING WE CAN DO. THANK YOU.
00:32:24.961: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER COMMUNICATION FROM COUNCIL, COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
00:32:29.300: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I DIDN'T TALK TO COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER PRIOR TO HIS STATEMENT, BUT I WILL DO HAVE THREE STATEMENTS THAT I WANT TO MAKE IN THE SPIRIT OF LOOKING FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE GOVERNANCE IN ANN ARBOR. AND I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT WE HAVE SOME SUBOPTIMAL PROCESSES. AND RATHER THAN SPEND A LOT OF ENERGY ON POLITICAL FIGHTING, I THINK WE NEED TO ASK HOW CAN WE IMPROVE THE PROCESS GOING FORWARD? I WILL GIVE OUTTH YOU THREE EXA. I WANT TO BRING A RESOLUTION REGARDING BOARD AND COMMISSION, THAT WOULD INCLUDE TERM LIMITS, GREATER TRANSPARENCY AND CLEARLY IDENTIFY WHAT THE EXPECTATIONS ARE. SO IF YOU ARE APPOINTED TO A BOARD AND COMMISSION, THIS IS HYPONETICALLY, YOU CAN EXPECT TO SERVE -- HYPOTHETICALLY, YOU CAN EXPECT TO SERVE FOR TWO YEARS AND POSSIBLY LONGER IF THERE'S SOMEONE ELSE NOT INTERESTED IN SERVING. BUT WE NEED TO CLEARLY IDENTIFY WHAT OUR EXPECTATION IS AND SO DEPENDING ON WHETHER THIS IS APPROVED BY COUNCIL OR NOT, WE'LL BE ABLE TO HAVE AN HONEST CONVERSATION ABOUT BOARDS AN COMMISSIONS. NUMBER TWO, BUDGET AMENDMENTS. I THINK THAT WE NEED TO HAVE OUR PUBLIC HEARING FOR THE BUDGET ONE WEEK AFTER ALL BUDGET AMENDMENTS ARE PUBLISHED. AND I KNOW THAT COUNCIL IS SORT OF UNDER THE DEADLINE TO GET THESE AMENDMENTS IN, BUT IF WE PASS THIS RESOLUTION IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS, WE WILL HAVE A WHOLE YEAR TO GET READY. AND NUMBER THREE, IT'S MINOR. I THINK THAT WE NEED TO START MONITORING STREET LIGHT OUTAGES AND NOT WAIT, ESPECIALLY IN THE DOWNTOWN AREA, FOR SOMEONE TO REPORT THAT A STREET LIGHT IS OUT. AND I DO HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR. I DISCOVERED THAT THE CROSSWALK, HURON NEAR THAYER, WHERE WE HAD A CRITICAL INJURY ACCIDENT OF A PEDESTRIAN IN JANUARY, IT WAS OUT AGAIN. IMMEDIATELY PUT A TICK IN AND I NOTICED THAT THAT TICKET WAS CLOSED TODAY, AND I'M WONDERING IF THAT STREET LIGHT IS NOW FUNCTIONING. THAT'S A QUESTION FOR THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR, DO YOU KNOW IF THE STREET LIGHT HAS BEEN REPAIRED ON HU HURON, WHICH WOUD BE GREAT NEWS.
00:34:59.249: >> City Admin. Lazarus: I KNOW THAT WE HAVE PUSHED DTE TO GET IT FIXED AND THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO ADDRESS THE SEVEN-DAY CIRCUIH TEMPORARY LIGHTING, I HAD THAT CONVERSATION WITH THEM YESTERDAY. SO I DON'T KNOW, BUT YOU CAN -- I CAN GUARANTEE YOU ON MY WAY HOME THIS EVENING, I WILL DRIVE BY.
00:35:17.000: >> Councilmember Griswold: THANK YOU. AND SO WILL I.
00:35:20.804: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, BANNISTER AND GRAND.
00:35:25.075: >> Councilmember Lumm: JUST A FOLLOW ON ABOUT THE BUDGET PROCESS. I WOULD ASK THE RULES COMMITTEE, WHOEVER IS TAKING THIS UP, I THINK TO CONSIDER THE -- THE NARROW TIME FRAME FOR WHEN -- AND THIS IS ALL ESTABLISHED BY CITY CHARTER. SO WHAT WE DO HERE IN TERMS OF THE BUDGET PROCESS IS OUTLINED IN OUR CITY CHARTER AND ANY TIME WE AMEND THE CITY CHARTER, THAT GOES BEFORE THE VOTERS. BY CITY CHARTER, WE RECEIVE THE ADMINISTRATOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET, THE SECOND MEETING IN APRIL AND BY CITY CHARTER, COUNCIL IS OBLIGATED TO AMENDMENT AND APPROVE OR NOT APPROVE THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR'S BUDGET BY THE LAST MEETING IN MAY. SO CITY COUNCIL GETS THIS BIG BUDGET BOOK IN MID-APRIL, AND THEN WE HAVE FOLLOWING THAT, WE HAVE PRESENTATIONS FROM CITY STAFF AND DEPARTMENTS AND LEADING UP TO THAT WE HAVE PRESENTATIONS AS WELL. IT'S UP TO US TO DIGEST THIS BUDGET BOOK, TO SUBMIT ALL OF OUR QUESTIONS. YOU CAN -- YOU CAN GO TO THE CITY -- THE CITY MAINTAINS AN EXCELLENT -- THE FINANCE DEPARTMENT MAINTAINS AN EXCELLENT WEBSITE AND YOU CAN GO THERE AND FIND ALL THE COUNCIL Q&A THAT WAS SUBMITTED FOR THIS YEAR, AND ALL THE VARIOUS BUDGET RECOMMENDATIONS. AND THEN WE HAD A DEADLINE TO MEET LAST WEDNESDAY WHICH IS THE TIME TO SUBMIT OUR BUDGET AMENDMENTS. I WILL JUST SAY FOR MYSELF, IT'S A MAJOR SCRAMBLE TO DO ALL OF THAT WORK IN THAT SHORTENED TIME FRAME. I THINK IT WOULD BE TOUGH FOR ANYONE TO. SO I THINK WHAT WOULD BE A GOOD THING FOR THE RULES COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER IS DO YOU HAVE BUDGET PUBLIC HEARING AT THE SAME MEETING WHEN WE APPROVE THE CITY BUDGET? AND THEN IT GIVES COUNCILMEMBERS AND ALL OF WHY YOU ARE COLLEAGUES ENOUGH TIME TO DIGEST THE BUDGET, ASK QUESTIONS, WRITE THEIR AMENDMENTS, AND THEY TO HEAR FROM FOLKS AS WELL. SO JUST MY TWO CENTS. THANKS.
00:37:24.260: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
00:37:25.161: >> Councilmember Bannister: I HAVE T TWO UPDATES ONE ABOUT WATER RATES AND THE OTHER ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SINCE OUR LAST COUNCIL MEETING, IT'S COME TO OUR ATTENTION THAT THE CITY'S ONLINE WATER CONSUMPTION TOOL IS NOT -- IS EXPERIENCING TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES AND HAS BEEN TAKEN DOWN, WHILE WE WET FOR THE NEW AQUAHAWK ONLINE CUSTOMER MORTAL TO GET ESTABLISHED. THE AQUAHAWK SYSTEM IS NOT READY FOR A SOFT LAUNCH UNTIL JULY 1st AND THEN A FULL LAUNCH BY DECEMBER 31st. IN THE MEANTIME, IF ANY RESIDENTS WOULD LIKE TO CHECK THEIR WATER CONSUMPTION, THEY CAN EMAIL THE CITY AT CUSTOMERSERVICE@A2 GOV.ORG. OR CALL THE CITY. AND CUSTOMER SERVICE WILL ALSO BE GIVING COUNCIL A REPORT ON HOW MANY OF YOU ARE CALLING IN FOR YOUR CONSUMPTION, PARTICULARLY HIGHLIGHTING   IF ANYONE HAS HAD ANY TROUBLE OR EXTRA LARGE BILLS THAT SHOULD BE BROUGHT TO COUNCIL'S ATTENTION, AND THE ONE OTHER THTHING IS ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING. MANY OF YOU HAD MENTIONED AN INTEREST IN POSSIBLY THE ANN ARBOR SENIOR CENTER IN BURNS PARK, LOCATED AT 1320 BALDWIN TO BE ADDED TO THE LIST OF CITY-OWNED PROPERTIES THAT JENNIFER HALL AND THE HOUSING COMMISSION IS CONSIDERING FOR BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND SO I'M HAPPY TO REPORT THAT THE SENIOR CENTER IN BURNS PARK HAS BEEN ADDED TO THE LIST, AND JENNIFER HALL IS CHECKING FOR ANY DEED RESTRICTIONS ON IT, BUT WILL SUBMIT IT ALONG WITH HER OTHER REPORT. I BELIEVE THE DUE DATE DEADLINE IS SEPTEMBER 30th. THANK YOU.
00:39:25.381: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.

WE ALREADY HAD QUITE A FEW APPLICATIONS SUBMITTED. SO THANK YOU TO THE MANY MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY WHO HAVE ALREADY SUBMITTED THEIR APPLICATIONS, BUT THERE'S STILL PLENTY OF TIME.

SO -- SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO REVIEWING ALL OF THOSE APPLICATIONS WHEN THEY GET TURNED IN BY MAY 31st BY 5 P.M. THANKS MUCH.
00:40:13.896: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER COMMUCOMMUNICATES FROM COUNCIL.
00:40:17.167: >> I HAVE A NUMBER OF COMMUNICATIONS. FIRST IS A NOTE FROM COUNCILMEMBER SMITH, COUNCILMEMBER SMITH EXPRESSES REGRET, EARNEST REGRET ABOUT NOT BEING HERE TODAY AT THIS MEETING. IT WAS A VERY IMPORTANT ONE. HE HAD A DEATH IN HIS FAMILY NECESSITYING HIS FAMILY'S BEING OUT OF TOWN FOR A TIME. AND SO HE ASKED ME TO PASS THAT ON TO EVERYONE. SO I NOW HAVE A NUMBER OF COMMUNICATIONS, I WOULD LIKE TO REQUEST CONFIRMATION OF THE FOLLOWING APPOINTMENTS PRESENTED TO CITY COUNCIL FOR CONSIDERATION. AT THE MAY 62,019th REGULAR SESSION. MY INTENTION HERE IS TO READ THROUGH THESE AND MY FURTHER UNDERSTANDING IS THERE'S SOME CONVERSATION WITH RESPECT TO SOME OF THEM. AND THEN WE MOVE OVER TO THOSE THAT REQUIRE INDIVIDUAL CONVERSATION. TOLTS AIRPORT ADVISORY COMMITTEE, MELANIE McNICHOLAS. AND TO THE ANN ARBOR AREA TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY, RAYM  D HESS. TO THE ANN ARBOR PUBLIC ART COMMISSION, DAVID ESAU.

MAY I HAVE A MOTION ON THOSE AS A GROUP AND THEN WE'LL THEM OUT INDIVIDUALLY. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRAND AND SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN. MAY I PROPOSE -- I HEARD COMMUNICATIONS FROM COUNCILMEMBERS WITH RESPECT TO FOUR PERSONS THAT IS MS. DIANE FELT, MS. WESTERBEE, MR. TRUDEAU AND MR. GORDON. PERHAPS WE CAN SEPARATE THOSE OUT INDIVIDUALLY AND IS THAT ACCEPTABLE.
00:43:43.040: >> Councilmember Eaton: IF I MAY. I WOULD LIKE TO NOTE FIVE OF THEM, AND THEY ARE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT THAN THE ONES THAT YOU MENTIONED. SO IF I COULD, I THINK IF I REMOVE THESE FIVE, WE CAN VOLT ON THE REMAINDER -- VOL VOTE ON THEM AS A REMAINDER. UNDER THE ANN ARBOR TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY, RAYMOND HESS. THE CITY PLANNING COMMISSION, SCOTT TRUDEAU AND JULIE WEATHERBEE. UNDER THE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE COMMISSION ROBERT GORDON. UNDER THE ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS, JULIE WEATHERBEE, AND THAT WOULD BE ALL THAT I WOULD PULL OUT. I DON'T KNOW IN ANYBODY ELSE HAS --
00:44:29.219: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE ANY OTHER COUNCILMEMBERS WISH TO VOTE UPON ANY OF THE OTHERS INDIVIDUALLY? GOING ONCE? PERHAPS THEN WE WILL VOTE ON ALL -- ON THOSE -- ON ALL THESE, THEREFORE EXCEPT HESS, JULIE WEATHERBEE TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION, AND ROBERT GORDON TO THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION, JULIE WEATHERBEE TO THE ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS. HAVE I STATED THAT ACCURATELY?
00:45:08.792: >> Councilmember Eaton: THAT'S CORRECT.
00:45:09.726: >> Mayor Taylor: ANY OBJECTION?
00:45:10.394: >> IT'S NOT AN OBJECTION. I WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT BEFORE THE VOTE IF THAT'S POSSIBLE. ARE WE DISCUSSING THE PROCESS?
00:45:15.866: >> Mayor Taylor: YES, OF COURSE. MY APOLOGIES. IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT SAID? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER? , THANK YOU.
00:45:21.605: >> Councilmember Hayner:  NOT ANYONE INDIVIDUALLY PER SE. I MEAN, I WILL VOTE AS OTHERS HAVE ASKED TO HAVE FOLKS REMOVED. I JUST WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT OF THE 44 APPOINTMENTS BEFORE US, 40 ARE REAPPOINTMENTS. AND SO I TOOK A LOT OF FLACK IN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS FOR SAYING THAT GENERALLY DON'T SUPPORT REAPPOINTMENTS. AND GENERALLY, I DON'T, BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE IN A TOWN OF 120,000 THAT WANT TO SERVE. WHEN WE FOLKS THAT SERVE ONE TERM, TWO TERM, THREE, FOUR, AND THEY ARE UP FOR REAPPOINTMENT AND SOME HAVE BEEN IN A POSITION FOR 12 YEARS OR EVEN LONGER AND IT'S SHOCKING TO ME THAT WE -- WE CAN'T MIX IT UP A LITTLE BIT. I DON'T WANT ANYONE TO TAKE PERSONALLY IF   I VOTE NO NOR YOUR REAPPOINTMENT. IT'S JUST THE WAY IT GOES. I FEEL WE NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB OF PENN GAUGING THE PUBLIC WHOLLY AND INCREASING DIVERSITY ON BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS AND JUST IN GENERAL GETTING SOME NEW THINKING INTO THE MIX. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK.
00:46:29.406: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE SET. COUNCILWOMAN GRISWOLD.
00:46:33.710: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WILL VOTE NO ON ALL THE APPOINTMENTS AND REAPPOINTMENTS TONIGHT BECAUSE I THINK WE HAVE A SUBOPTIMAL PROCESS AND IT REALLY DISAPPOINTED ME THAT VIVIAN CHANG WHO HAS SERVED ON THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION, WITH WHAT SOME COULD REFER TO AS WITH GREAT DISTINCTION IS MISSING FROM THIS LIST. I RECEIVED MANY EMAILS AND COMMUNICATIONS ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF REAPPOINTING PEOPLE WHO HAD SERVED AND MADE A VALUABLE CONTRIBUTION TO THIS COMMUNITY, AND TO LEAVE HER OFFER THE LIST, DISAPPOINTS ME.
00:47:09.980: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. COUNCILMEMBER GRAND?
00:47:12.416: >> Councilmember Grand: I WILL BE CERTAINLY SUPPORTING EVERYONE WHO IS COMING UP FOR REAPPOINTMENT. I WOULD JUST LIKE TO -- WHEN I LOOK AT THIS LIST, YOU KNOW, I SEE FOLKS WHO HAVE HAD SIGNS FOR PEOPLE WHO RUN AGAINST ME IN THEIR YARDS. I SEE PEOPLE WHO -- I SEE ONE PERSON WHO ACTUALLY IN RECENT WEEKS ACTUALLY SENT ME AN EMAIL THAT WAS SO ANGRY WITH ME, THAT THE CERTAIN THREATENED TO FEED ME FOOD THAT HE BELIEVED WAS POISONED. BUT -- TRUE STORY! BUT I BELIEVE THIS PERSON SERVES HONORABLY IN HIS ROLE AS A COMMISSIONER. AND SO IT -- SO IT'S JUST -- AND THERE ARE FOLKS THAT -- THERE ARE     PEOPLE WHO HAVE -- YOU KNOW, EVEN -- WHO I WILL DISAGREE WITH ON CERTAIN ISSUES THAT I FEEL ARE PRETTY KEY TO OUR CITY, BUT I BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE EXCELLENT VOLUNTEERS. I BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE CONCERNED WITH THE ISSUES, AND THAT THEY ARE INVESTED, AND THIS THEY PUT A LOT OF TIME AND EFFORT. I KNOW AS A FORMER COMMISSIONER AND CHAIR OF A COMMISSION MYSELF, MANY OF THESE FOLKS ARE OFTEN PAYING MONEY TO BE ON THESE COMMISSIONS. THEY PAY FOR CHILD CARE. THEY TAKE TIME AWAY FROM WORK, AND SO WHILE I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE OTHERS WHO WANT TO SERVE, I THINK IT DOES US A GREAT DISSERVICE TO -- TO POLITICIZE AND DISRESPECT THE WORK THAT OUR CURRENT VOLUNTEER COMMISSIONERS DO FOR OUR COMMUNITY. I THINK THEY SERVE US HONNABLY. THEY PUT IN A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF EFFORT, AND IT -- AND BEING ON IT, HAVING BEEN ON A COMMISSION WHERE THERE ARE TERM LIMITS, I CAN, YOU KNOW, SPEAK TO THE FACT THAT SOMETIMES THERE'S AN ABSENCE OF INSTITUTIONAL MEMORY AND SOMETIMES IT CAN TAKE A WHILE IF YOU ARE ONLY MEETING ONCE A MONTH TO GET -- TO GET ON BOARDED AND TO -- TO, YOU KNOW, HAVE YOUR LEARNING CURVE. SO I ENTHUSIASTICALLY SUPPORT ALL OF THE VOLUNTEERS AND THANK NEXT FOR THEIR SERVICE.
00:49:16.570: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
00:49:17.872: >> Councilmember Lumm: I WOULD LIKE TO NOTE THAT FOR SOME OF US, -- LIKE YOU JUST NOTED, COUNCILMEMBER GRAND, BEEN VOTING FOR PEOPLE, APPOINTING PEOPLE ON BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS WHO HAVE HAD YARD SIGNS FOR OUR OPPONENTS, YEAH, IN THEIR YARDS. AND SO THAT HAS NOT BEEN A DRIVING FACTOR IN WHETHER OR NOT FOLKS ARE VIEWED AS QUALIFIED. THERE'S A COUPLE ON HERE TONIGHT WHERE I'M WELL AWARE, YOU KNOW, THAT THEY MAY HAVE SUPPORTED -- THAT THEY DID SUPPORT MY OPPONENT. THAT'S NOT -- AGAIN, THAT'S NOT A DETERMINING FACTOR. SO I DO REGRET AS WELL THAT THIS IS VIEWED AS PURELY POLITICS. IT'S NOT. WE DID GET AN EMAIL JUST BEFORE THE COUNCIL MEETING STARTED FROM A FORMER COUNCILMEMBER, WHO IS CONC CONCERNED ALL OF THE FOLKS NOT BEING REAPPOINTED AND THIS INDIVIDUAL SPOKE TO THE REAPPOINTMENT AND APPOINTMENT CULTURE, AND I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHAT THAT MEANS. I WILL SAY THAT -- THAT IT'S -- YES, REAPPOINTMENTS ARE USUALLY JUST A MATTER OF COURSE, BUT NOT ALWAYS. AND -- AND SO THERE'S NOT -- I THINK IT HAS BECOME PART OF THE CULTURE IN RECENT DECADES, BECAUSE THE MAKEUP OF COUNCIL WAS SUCH THAT -- THAT THERE WAS NEVER ANY -- THIS WASN'T THE KIND OF, OKAY, I WILL BE FRANK, OPPORTUNITY TOSS -- TO ELECT OTHER PEOPLE WHO MIGHT HAVE DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES AND ADD THEM TO THESE BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS. AND, I THINK WITH THIS ELECTION -- LAST ELECTION, PEOPLE FEEL EMPOWERED TO HAVE FOLKS REPRESENT SOME OF THESE OTHER PERSPECTIVES THAT PERHAPS HAVE NOT BEEN WIDELY REPRESENTED ON SOME OF THESE BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS. SO THAT'S KIND OF WHAT BROUGHT US -- HAS BROUGHT US TO WHERE WE ARE NOW, AND SOME -- SOME MAY ATTRIBUTE IT TO POLITICS BUT I THINK IT'S MORE NUANCED AN THIS. SO THALLU THAT'S MY TWO CENTS OT ONE. THANKS.
00:51:39.247: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION?
00:51:42.850: >> Councilmember Eaton: THIS IS ON THE BLOCK?
00:51:44.618: >> Mayor Taylor: I WILL SUPPORT ALL OF THESE MEMBERS. I DO BELIEVE THAT THEY PROVIDE A DIVERSITY OF VIEWPOINT. FOLKS HERE HAVE SPOKEN ON THE -- SPOKEN IN THE CHAMBER, IN SUPPORT OF POSITIONS THAT I TAKE, AND IN OPPOSITION TO POSITIONS THAT I TAKE. THERE ARE FOLKS WHO APPEARED ON, YOU KNOW, OPPONENTS' WEBSITES PROMINENTLY, AND THAT'S OKAY. POLITICAL ACTIVITY OUTSIDE THE ROOM, AND, YOU KNOW, ADVOCACY INSIDE THE ROOM. THAT'S WHAT WE ARE DOING HERE BECAUSE WE ALL BELIEVE IN OUR -- WE BELIEVE IN DOING WHAT WE CAN TO MAKE ANN ARBOR A BETTER PLACE. I BELIEVE THAT THE FOLKS ON THIS LIST HAVE SERVED -- HAVE SERVED WELL, AND I BELIEVE TOO THAT -- THAT THE STANDARDS OF -- THAT FOLKS WHO SEVEN AS VOLUNTEERS ON BOARDS AND -- WHO SESERVE AS VOLUNTEERS ON BOARDS AN COMMISSIONS SHOULD HAVE DIFFERENT EXPECTATIONS THAN THOSE ON THE COUNCIL DAIS. I THINK FOLKS ON THE BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS BEING I BELIEVE IT'S IN THE MAIN -- OR RIGHT AND PROPER TO -- YOU KNOW, TO HONOR THEIR -- TO -- PEOPLE SIGN UP FOR BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS FOR DIFFERENT REASONS, BUT AT THE CORE, IT IS TO -- AT ITS CORE, IT IS TO SERVE THE COMMUNITY. AND WHEN THAT SERVICE IS -- IS CRITIQUED OR SUBJECT TO CRITICISM HERE AT THE TABLE, I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD DO AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT THAT'S DONE, BUT I'M SAYING THAT IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT THAT BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, WE'RE A TOWN OF 120,000 PEOPLE AND THIS' A WIDE VARIETY OF FOLKS WHO ARE WILLING AND EAGER TO SERVE BUT THE SET OF PEOPLE WHO ARE WILLING TO PUT THEMSELVES UP TO VOTES THAT WILL NOT BE UNANIMOUS IS SMALLER, I THINK THAN MANY OF US REALIZE. AND I -- I'M CONCERNED ABOUT A -- YOU KNOW, THE LOSS OF -- THE LOSS OF THAT CULTURE. FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN SET? COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER?
00:53:56.917: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES, I WILL BE JOINING COUNCILMEMBER EATON IN VOTING AGAINST SOME OF THESE REAPPOINTMENTS, FOR SOME OF THE REASONS THAT COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER MENTIONED, THAT WE HAVE 40 OR 44 REAPPOINTMENTS IN A TOWN OF 120,000 PEOPLE, AND SO WE DO NEED TO BE   REACHING OUT MORE TO EVERYONE, AS WE HAVE BEEN DOING, INVITING PEOPLE TO APPLY FOR BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS, EVEN IF YOU DON'T GET IT THERE ROUND, YOU ARE ON THE LIST AND IN THE QUEUE AND COULD GET IT NEXT TIME. I AGREE WITH COUNCILMEMBER COUNCILMEMBERGRISWOLD THAT THERA SUBOPTIMAL PROCESS. GETTING THE RESUMES AND SEEING WHO IS ON THE WAIT LIST AND ALL. I DO WANT TO ECHO THE CONCERN THAT VIVIAN CHANG IS NOT BEING AREAPPOINTED TO THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION. SHE CURRENTLY SERVED AS VICE CHAIR WITH GREAT DISTINCTION. SHE LED US LAST YEAR AND BEFORE THROUGH A LOT OF THE POLICE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION WORK. SHE  ARTICULATED THINGS FOR MANY MEMBERS. I'M VERY SORRY THAT SHE WAS -- THAT MAYOR TAYLOR DID NOT SEE HIS WAY CLEAR TO GET VIVIAN COME BEFORE US AGAIN ON THE BOARDS AND THE COMMISSIONS. THANK YOU.
00:55:26.803: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE SET. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
00:55:29.840: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, MAYOR TAYLOR. I WILL TRY TO KEEP THIS BRIEF. I AM STRUGGLING WITH SOME TOOTH PAIN. ANYHOW, I DO WANT TO SPEAK UP. WE HAVE A SITUATION IN THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION. I AM THE LIAISON TO THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION. VIVIAN CHANG DID NOT RECEIVE THE NOMINATION TO SERVE AGAIN. I THINK THIS NEEDS TO BE BROUGHT UP. YOU THINK IT'S -- I THINK IT'S MY ROLE AS THE LIAISON TO BRING UP AND PUT IT ON THE RECORD THAT THIS IS SOMEONE WHO HAS SUPPORT OF THEIR FELLOW COMMISSIONERERS AND THE CHAIR AD YET DID NOT GET THE REAPPOINTMENT. THAT GOES TO SHOW MANY IN THE COMMUNITY THAT, YOU KNOW, REAPPOINTMENTS ARE NOT AUTOMATIC. AND SOME FOLKS PERHAPPED BELIEVED AND THOUGHT THEY -- PERHAPS BELIEVED AND THEY WILL THOUGHT THEY WOULD. THERE WAS AN ELECTION LAST FALL, F FOUR NEW COUNCILMEMBERS JOINED COUNCIL. IT'S A 40% MAKEUP AND THEY DO A LOT OF WORK, THEY DO A LOT OF HEAVY LIFTING. THEY ADVISE US ON OUR POLICY MAKING. IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE PEOPLE ON THE BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS THAT REFLECT THE DIVERSITY IN OUR COMMUNITY, AND THERE'S OPPORTUNITY -- PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITY. WE SAW THAT WITH THE ICPOC, WHEN THAT WAS FORMED AS OVER 60 PEOPLE VOLUNTEERED TO SERVE ON THAT COMMISSION. SO I THINK WHEN THERE'S DAYLIGHT, IT WILL BE MORE PEOPLE APPLYING FOR THESE BOARDS AN COMMISSIONS AND I THINK PERHAPS MANY IN RECENT HISTORY HAVE TAKEN A PASS BECAUSE THEY KNEW THAT POINT OF VIEW WOULD NOT BE SUPPORTED. SO I JUST NEED TO GO ON RECORD, AGAIN, SPEAKING FOR THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE AT THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION AND THE OTHER ISSUES WE HAVE ON BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS. THE VAST MAJORITY GET REAPPOINTED AND GET APPROVED. IF YOU CAN'T GET SEVEN VOTES, THERE'S PROBABLY MORE THAN ONE ISSUE THAT'S PREVENTING YOU FROM GETTING THE SUPPORT FROM COUNCIL. IT'S NOT ONE ISSUE, BUT MANY ISSUES IF YOU CAN'T GET SEVEN VOTES.
00:57:54.117: >> M  or Taylor: THANK YOU. FURTHER DISCUSSION ON THE SET? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE. STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER EATON. IS EVERYBODY CLEAR ABOUT THIS? THIS THE SET LESS THE FIVE.
00:58:11.334: >> Councilmember Eaton: YES.
00:58:11.935: >> Councilmember Nelson: YES.
00:58:14.437: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES.
00:58:16.239: >> Councilmember Hayner:  NO.
00:58:18.541: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES.
00:58:20.476: >> Councilmember Griswold: NO.
00:58:23.746: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES.
00:58:24.480: >> Councilmember Grand: YES.
00:58:25.081: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES.
00:58:27.984: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
00:58:28.484: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION CARRIES.
00:58:29.986: >> Mayor Taylor: THESE HAVE ALL BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED. LET'S ROLL TO THE ANN ARBOR TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY RAYMOND HESS. MR. EATON.
00:58:50.440: >> Councilmember Eaton: YES, MR. HESS IS NEW TO THE EMPLOYMENT, BUT HE'S VERY, VERY NEW. WHEN ELI COOPER WAS APPOINTED TO THE AATA, I DON'T BELIEVE WE SHOULD BE APPOINTING CITY EMPLOYEES TO A BOARD THAT HAS OVERLAPPING RESPONSIBILITIES. A CITY EMPLOYEE SHOULD OWE THEIR SOLE DUTY OF LOYALTY TO THE CITY AND THEY SHOULDN'T BE PUT IN A POSITION WHERE THEY HAVE TO SPLIT THAT LOYALTY BETWEEN THE AATA, AND THEIR SERVICE FOR THE CITY. SO IN THE PAST, I VOTED AGAINST ELI COOPER, AND I WILL BE VOTING AGAINST RAYMOND HESS FOR TH     REASON. BUT ADDITIONALLY, IF WE SHOULD HAVE A CITY EMPLOYEE ON THE AATA, THEN I WOULD ACTUALLY PREFER KEEPING ELI COOPER. MR. COOPER HAS MANY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE. HIS SERVICE ON THE AATA, HAS BEEN GOOD. I ACTUALLY APPRECIATE THE POINTS THAT HE MAKES AT THOSE BOARD MEETINGS AND, IF WE ARE GOING TO CHOOSE BETWEEN TWO CITY EMPLOYEES, I THINK WE SHOULD GO WITH THE CITY EMPLOYEE THAT HAS THE MOST EXPERIENCE WITH OUR TRANSPORTATION ISSUES. SO I REALLIES THAT THIS -- WHAT'S BEFORE US RIGHT NOW IS SIMPLY THIS PARTICULAR APPOINTMENT. I WILL BE VOTING AGAINST IT FOR THE REASONS I HAVE SAID. I HOPE THAT IF IT DOES NOT PREVAIL, THAT THE MAYOR WILL CONSIDER REAPPOINTING MR. COOPER. THANK YOU.
01:00:24.567: >> Mayor Taylor: I WILL BE VOTING IN FAVOR OF MR. ELSE. I BELIEVE THAT THE CROSS POLL INNIZATION AND THE AATA IS VERY IMPORTANT. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT THAT BODY KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON WITH RESPECT TO TRANSPORTATION ISSUES IN THE CITY AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE INTERNALLY AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT'S GOING ON WITH AATA. THE NOTION OF FOLKS FROM DIFFERENT BODIES SERVING ON DIFFERENT BOARDS IS PERFECTLY COMMONPLACE. OUR TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION, BY WAY OF EXAMPLE, INCLUDES REPRESENTATIVES FROM OTHER -- FROM OTHER JURISDICTIONS AND FROM OTHER BODIES BY WAY THE UNIVERSITY, CERTAINLY THERE'S A REPRESENTATIVE FROM SCHOOLS TOO. AND I WOULD OBSERVE THAT MR. HESS IS A AATA USER AND HE LIVES IN THE CITY AND HE WILL DO EXCELLENT WORK ON THE BOARD AND I ENCOURAGE PEOPLE'S SUPPORT. COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
01:01:23.860: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I HAVE A QUESTION. I DON'T KNOW WHO AT THIS TABLE IS THE APPROPRIATE PERSON TO ASK IT, BUT COUNCILMEMBER EATON, YOU SAID THAT YOU OPPOSED THE ORIGINAL APPOINTMENT OF ELI COOPER AND SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS, WHO HELD THAT POSITION BEFORE 50 HEF ELI COOPER? WAS ELI COOPER THE FIRST PERSON TO BE THE REPRESENTATIVE --
01:01:47.984: >> Mayor Taylor: HE WAS --
01:01:48.584: >> Councilmember Nelson:  DO YOU FOLLOW WHAT I'M ASKING?
01:01:52.822: >> Mayor Taylor: MY RECOLLECTION FROM THAT CONVERSATION AT THE TABLE, AT POITHEAPPOINTMENT OF A STAFF MER WAS NOVEL.
01:02:02.532: >> Councilmember Nelson:  SO PREVIOUSLY IT WAS JUST A PERSON.
01:02:05.402: >> Mayor Taylor: A VOLUNTEER OF ONE NATURE OR ANOTHER. FURTHER DISCUSSION. ROLL CALL VOTE STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
01:02:16.513: >> Councilmember Eaton: NO.
01:02:17.112: >> Councilmember Nelson: YES.
01:02:18.181: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES.
01:02:21.216: >> Councilmember Hayner: YES.
01:02:26.488: >> Councilmember Bannister: THIS IS   TO --
01:02:29.124: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. HESS EXCLUSIVELY.
01:02:31.326: >> Councilmember Bannister: NO.
01:02:33.529: >> Councilmember Griswold: NO.
01:02:36.966: >> Councilmember Lumm: NO.
01:02:37.533: >> Councilmember Grand: YES.
01:02:38.133: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES.
01:02:41.804: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
01:02:42.304: >> Clerk Beaudry: THE MOTION CARRIES.
01:02:44.674: >> Mayor Taylor: TO THE CITY PLANNING COMMISSION, SCOTT
01:02:47.544: >> Councilmember Eaton: MR. MAY OR.
01:02:53.849: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
01:02:55.518: >> Councilmember Eaton: BOTH OF THEMENTS THAT I PULLED OUT FOR THE CITY PLANNING COMMISSION HAVE SERVED WELL. THEY ARE DEDICATED VOLUNTEERS. BUT MY CONCERN IS THAT AS WE EMBARK ON REVIEWING AND REVISING OUR MASTER PLAN, THAT OUR PLANNING COMMISSION SHOULD HAVE A GREATER DIVERSITY OF VIEW POINTS AND SO I WOULD LIKE TO DIG DEEPER INTO THE COMMUNITY AND SEEK OTHER POINTS OF VIEW, AND THIS IS NOT PERSONAL. THIS IS JUST I'M SEEKING GREATER DIVERSITY ON THE PLANNING COMMISSION. THANK YOU.
01:03:35.329: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION?R GRAND?
01:03:38.896: >> CouncilmeTHANK YOU. I WAS FORTUNATE   ENOUGH TO SEE MR. TRUDEAU ON HIS BIRTHDAY LAST WEEK AND, IF YOU EVER FOLLOWED HIM ON TWITTER, YOU WILL SEE THAT HE SPENT HIS BIRTHDAY AS A GOOD TRANSPORTATION COMMISSIONER MIGHT DO, MAKING SURE THAT HE HIT ALL 11 BIKING STATIONS ON BIKE TO WORK DAY. HE IS WONKY. HE IS ENGAGED. AND THAT MEANS THAT HE'S -- HE IS EAGER TO HAVE PUBLIC CONVERSATIONS ABOUT ISSUES RELATED TO PLANNING AND THE GROWTH OF OUR CITY, AND ABOUT TRANSPORTATION ISSUES. I BELIEVE WHILE COUNCILMEMBER EATON SAYS THIS IS NOT PERSONAL, I DON'T THINK SO. HE DOESN'T THINK LIKE I DO. I'M ALSO VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE FACT THAT -- THAT THIS COUNCIL IS SAYING IF YOU DON'T THINK LIKE I DO AND YOU SPEAK OUT AND --
01:04:41.203: >> POINT OF ORDER.
01:04:44.340: >> Mayor Taylor: POINT OF ORDER. GRISWOLD.
01:04:47.243: >> Councilmember Griswold: PLEASE DON'T SAY HOW I THINK. YOU CAN SAY HOW YOU THINK, BUT IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE.
01:04:52.982: >> Councilmember Grand: I SAID I'M CONCERNED ABOUT   HOW YOU CONCERNED. I'M CONCERNED THAT COLLEAGUES ARE TAKING MEMBERS TO THE COMMUNITY WHEN THEY SAY, WE DON'T TAKE THIS -- DON'T TAKE THIS PERSONALLY, BUT WE WANT A DIVERSITY OF THOUGHT THAT I INTERPRET THAT AS MEANING IF YOU SPEAK OUT AGAINST HOW I -- AGAINST A CERTAIN MEMBER OF COUNCIL, I WILL DENY YOUR APPOINTMENT. THAT I AM REALLY CONCERNED THAT THIS IS GOING TO HAVE AN EFFECT, WHERE PEOPLE WILL NOT WANT TO BE ENGAGED IN THE NEXT ELECTION BECAUSE THEY WILL BE WORRIED THAT THEY WILL BE KICKED OFF THE BOARDS AN COMMISSIONS AND NOT WANT TO SPEAK OUT IN A CERTAIN WAY. WHEN I WILL BROUGHT FORWARD MR. GORDON'S -- THE ISSUE IN ANOTHER COMMISSION ON WHICH HE SERVED, MEMBERS OF THAT COMMISSION IMMEDIATELY SAID TO ME, OH, NOW I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT WHAT I SAY ON SOCIAL MEDIA. AND MM-HMM, IS NOT WHAT I WANT TO HEAR. MM-HMM IS UNACCEPTABLE. I WANT OUR CITIZENS AND OUR VEERS TO FEEL FREE TO SPEAK THEIR MINDS AND TO NOT FEEL -- NOT WORRY ABOUT FACING RETRIBUTION, POLITICALLY, AND NOT WORRY ABOUT FACING RETRIBUTION AT THIS TABLE. TO ME, IT'S -- I HAVE BEEN SUP UPSET THAT HAVE HAPPENED AT THIS TABLE, ESPECIALLY OVER THE LAST SIX MONTHS. THIS RANKS UP THERE, REALLY CLOSE TO THE TOP. AND WHEN WE SAY DIVERSITY OF THOUGHT, I DON'T EVER -- YOU KNOW, YOU WERE ELECTED. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO MAKE DECISIONS HOWEVER YOU WANT TO MAKE DECISIONS BUT I HAVE THE RIGHT TO SPEAK OUT ABOUT MY CONCERNS AND I'M CONCERNED THAT IT WILL INTIMIDATE PEOPLE FROM SPEAKING OUT AND I HOPE IT DOESN'T BECAUSE I 4 HOPE THAT THOSE SAME PEOPLE WHO SPEAK OUT, WHO GET TURNED DOWN WORK REALLY HARD IN 2020. SO WE NEVER SEE THIS HAPPEN AGAIN.
01:06:49.398: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:06:51.267: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: WELL, UNFORTUNATELY THIS HAS GONE IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO HAVE A CIVIL CONVERSATION, BUT APPARENTLY SOME WANT TO BRING IT BACK INTO THE MUD. SO HERE I AM. THERE WAS A MAJOR ELECTION LAST YEAR. THERE WERE FOUR NEW COUNCILMEMBERS ELECTED. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THE SHOCK IS AND WHAT THE -- THE DESPERATE GRASP OF CALLING OUT OUR VALUES EVERY TIME REMEMBER MEMBERS -- CERTAIN MEMBERS ON THIS TABLE DON'T GET THEIR WAY. WE'RE NOT UP HERE LEGISLATING VALUES. SOME OF THESE BOARDS AND COMMISSIONERS -- AND YOU DO HAVE NO BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU SAY WHEN YOU WORK ON A BOARD AND COMMISSION. YES. YES, YOU DO. YES, YOU SHOULD. BECAUSE LIKE WHEN I GOT MY VERSITY LETTER IN WREST -- VARSITY LETTER IN WRESTLING. WHEN I WALKED AROUND WITH MY VARSITY COAT, REPRESENTED MY HIGH SCHOOL. SAME THING WHEN YOU SIT ON A BOARD OR A COMMISSION. YOU REPRESENT THE CITY. YOU WORK WITH STAFF. YOU WORK WITH THE ELECTED OFFICIALS. YOU DON'T GO OUT ON SOCIAL MEDIA INFLAME RHETORIC. I MEAN, WE HAVE PEOPLE NOW BEING CALLED RACIST, SEGREGATIONISTS, ALL SORTS OF CODE, INFLAMMATORY LANGUAGE. IT'S NOT BASED IN ANY SORT OF EVIDENCE OR FACT. AND IT'S CAUSED OUR CITY NOW TO SUFFER THE SAME UGLINESS THAT EXISTS IN D.C. BUT ONE THING IS DIFFERENT HERE. WE GO TO THE SAME SCHOOLS. WE GO TO THE SAME STORES. WE GO TO THE SAME MUSEUMS. WE LIVE TOGETHER. SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN CONTINUE TO LIVE TOGETHER. BUT DO BE CALLING EACH OTHER RACISTS, ISN'T HELPING. AND I WILL LEAVE IT AT THAT, BUT THERE'S A -- THERE'S A REASON WHY THESE PEOPLE ARE PULLED OFF. OKAY? THERE'S A REASON THIS IS GETTING UGLY. LET'S NOT ACT LIKE IT HAPPENED IN A VACUUM AND THAT WE ARE THE ONES UP HERE CREATING THE PROBLEM.
01:09:22.151: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
01:09:25.054: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I HAVE NOTHING TO ADD TO THAT LAST COMMENT. I DO HOPE THAT THE MAYOR WILL ACTUALLY ENFORCE OUR COUNCIL RULES THIS EVENING.
01:09:38.534: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION?
01:09:41.600: >> Councilmember Eaton: IF I MAY.
01:09:44.102: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
01:09:45.136: >> Councilmember Eaton: THIS EVENING, WE WERE PRESENTED WITH THREE PROPOSED REAPPOINTMENTS TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION. AND WE HAVE PULLED TWO. I WOULD NOTE THAT THE THIRD APPOINTMENT THAT WE HAVE ALREADY APPROVED IS SOMEBODY WHO ACTUALLY HAS VERY OFTEN, NO UNCERTAIN TERMS DISAGREED WITH ME, EVEN MISCHARGE CHARACTERIZED -- MISCHARACTERIZED MY PERFORMANCE BUT HER WORK ON THE PLANNING COMMISSION, REPRESENTS THE DIFFDIFFERENT VIEW. SO THIS IS NOT ABOUT WHO SUPPORTED ME IN ANY GIVEN ELECTION OR ANYBODY ELSE. IT'S ABOUT SEEKING A GREATER NUMBER OF POINTS OF VIEW ON A COMMISSION THAT HAS CONSIDERABLE SWAY AND ESPECIALLY AS WE APPROACH THE REVIEW OF THE MATTER PLAN, IS REALLY NEEDED TO REPRESENT, EVERYBODY IN TOWN AND NOT JUST SELECT SEGMENTS OF OUR POPULATION. SO I REALLY HOPE WE CAN HAVE A CIVIL DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS, BUT PERHAPS NOT.
01:10:55.841: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
01:10:58.476: >> Councilmember Grand: I WOULD LIKE TO REMIND, ESPECIALLY MY MALE COLLEAGUES THAT WHEN I DISAGREE AND USE STRONG LANGUAGE, THAT IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT'S UNCIVIL. IT JUST MEANS THAT I'M A WOMAN WITH AN OPINION.
01:11:15.593: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? I WILL VOTE IN FAVOR OF THIS NOMINEE AND INDEED ALL THE OTHER NOMINEES THIS EVENING. I BELIEVE THAT THIS NOMINEE HAS DONE EXCELLENT WORK ON THE BOARD AND I BELIEVE THIS NOMINEE, THEIR SERVICE ON THE BOARD DOES -- DOES THE CITY CREDIT. I BELIEVE THAT -- YOU KNOW, I UNDERSTAND THE MATH OF THE ROOM, AND -- BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT, YOU KNOW, THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF -- A LOT OF -- IT'S BEEN OBSERVED FREQUENTLY THAT THERE WAS AN ELECTION IN AUGUST AND NOVEMBER AND I UNDERSTAND HOW THAT WORKED OUT ON A WARD-BY-WARD BASIS, BUT I WILL ALSO SAY THAT I UNDERSTAND HOW THAT WORKED OUT ON A CITYWIDE BASIS, AND THAT THE CHARTER VESTS THE MAYOR WITH THE AUTHORITY TO TAKE THE CITY'S INTERESTS AS A WHOLE INTO ACCOUNT, AND TO MAKE THOSE NOMINATIONS. AND THAT IS WHAT I DO AS I CONSIDER WHO I CHOOSE TO BRING FORWARD FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION IN ADVANCE OF THEIR PUBLIC DISCLOSURE, AND ACTUALLY TRANSPARENT WAY, WHERE YOU DO HAVE FULL AND COMPLETE ACCESS TO ALL OF THE THE NOMINEES -- OF ALL THE NOMINEES' INFORMATION AND ALL THE ACCESS OF THE INFORMATION, FOR FOLKS WHO I'M NOT SHO CHOOSING TO BRIG FORWARD AT THAT TIME. YOU KNOW, I BELIEVE THAT THE BOARDS AND THE COMMISSIONS THAT WE HAVE DO EXCELLENT WORK. I BELIEVE THAT THOSE WHO I BRING FORWARD WILL SERVE WITH DISTINCTION AND ACT IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE CITY AS A WHOLE AND I BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE -- THAT THEY HAVE EARNED OUR SUPPORT. AND ROLL CALL VOTE WITH RESPECT TO MR. TRUDEAU --
01:13:17.179: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I GOT TO MOVE MY ARMS.
01:13:20.749: >> Mayor Taylor: ROLL CALL VOTE, STARTING WITH COMMISSIONER TRUDEAU.
01:13:27.989: >> Councilmember Eaton: NO.
01:13:28.590: >> Councilmember Nelson:  NO.
01:13:30.226: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: NO.

01:13:40.402: >> Councilmember Grand: YES.
01:13:41.202: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES.
01:13:43.872: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
01:13:44.373: >> Clerk Beaudry: THE MOTION FAILS. CONVERSATION NOW WITH RESPECT TO COMMISSIONER WEATHERBEE. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
01:13:51.413: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT SINCE THE CONVERSATION HAS BEEN TO THE RESUME, AS COUNCILMEMBER GRAND POINTED OUT, WE HAD IN EXCESS OF 40 APPLICANTS FOR THE CENTER OF THE CITY. PEOPLE WANT TO BE INVOLVED AND I ALSO WOULD POINT OUT THAT THE CONVERSATION AROUND ELECTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES THAT IT'S ONLY BEEN SINCE THIS LAST ELECTION THAT WE HAVE PUT IN THE MECHANISMS WITH THE MAYOR'S BLESSING AND ASSISTANCE TO HAVE ACCESS TO THIS TYPE OF THING. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT WE HAD THE ACCESS TO THE BACKGROUND AND THAT'S A RESULT OF TRANSPARENCY EFFORTS THAT THE NEW COUNCIL HAS BROUGHT FORWARD AND THEY ARE WELCOME. THEY ARE WELCOMED AND I THANK THE MAYOR FOR DOING IT. SO THAT'S ALL. I WANTED TO THROW THAT OUT THERE.
01:14:50.736: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN AND THEN LUMM.
01:14:52.471: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF COMMISSIONER WEATHERBEE'S APPOINTMENT TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION AND THE ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS. FIRST WITH RESPECT TO HAVING INSTITUTIONAL KNOWLEDGE ON BOTH BODIES AT THE SAME TIME. THE ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS HAVE INTERRELATED CHARGES. THAT IS, THE PLANNING COMMISSION REVIEWS AND APPROVES SITE PLANS THAT -- THAT FELT WITHIN MOST OF THE BOUNDS OF OUR ZONING. ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS REVIEWS AND APPROVES OR DENIES THE NEED FOR VARIANCES WHERE THE ZONING CREATES A HARDSHIP FOR A PROPERTY OWNER, FOR WHICH WE NEED TO GIVE SPECIAL ALLOWANCE FOR THAT TO HAPPEN. COMMISSIONER WEATHERBEE HAS PUT IN A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF HARD WORK THESE PAST YEARS, SERVING ON BOTH BODIES WHICH ARE NOT EASY LIFTS. AND HAVING THE INSTITUTIONAL KNOWLEDGE FROM BOTH -- BOTH BODIES IN ONE PERSON IS INCREDIBLY VALUABLE. ALSO TO SAY WITH RESPECT TO DIVERSITY OF THOUGHT, I OFTEN FIND SERVING ON THE PLANNING COMMISSION, THAT COMMISSIONER WEATHWEATHERBEE BRINGS FORWARD UNIQUE AND SINGULAR PERSPECTIVE, IDEAS, LINES OF QUESTIONING. THEY DONE ALWAYS GET THE SUPPORT OF THE REST OF THE BODY AND I THINK THAT'S EXACTY THERE THE TYPE OF DIVERSITY OF THOUGHT THAT MY COLLEAGUES ARE DISCUSSING. THOSE KEEN OBSERVERS, THOSE FOLLOWERS OF THE PLANNING COMMISSION WILL KNOW THAT COMMISSIONER WEATHERBEE IS SOMEONE WHO WILL BE A LONE VOTE, LONE VOICE, LONE QUESTIONER AROUND AREAS OF PARTICULAR INTEREST TO HERSELF AS ONE OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD REPRESENTATIVES ON THE PLANNING COMMISSION. SO I WILL BE GLAD TO SUPPORT HER REAPPOINTMENT.
01:16:42.748: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
01:16:45.484: >> Councilmember Lumm: JUST A PROCESS OBSERVATION. I WILL SHARE THAT WHEREVER I HAVE REQUESTED OR ANY COUNCILMEMBER HAS REQUESTED SOMEONE'S RESUME, IT'S ALWAYS BEEN PROVIDED. THERE'S NEVER BEEN ANY RESISTANCE TO THAT, AND I APPRECIATE THAT. AND IT'S NOT JUST TRUE FOR MAYOR TAYLOR, BUT HIS PREDECESSORS AS WELL, WITH WHOM I HAVE SERVED. SO ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS ASK, BECAUSE THAT INFORMATION IS PROVIDED AND MADE READILY AVAILABLE.
01:17:13.045: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
01:17:22.587: >> Councilmember Eaton: NO.
01:17:23.188: >> Councilmember Nelson:  NO.
01:17:24.657: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: NO.
01:17:27.192: >> Councilmember Hayner:  NO.
01:17:30.729: >> Councilmember Bannister: NO.
01:17:31.830: >> Councilmember Griswold: NO.
01:17:34.432: >> Councilmember Lumm: NO.
01:17:35.000: >> Councilmember Grand: YES.
01:17:35.600: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES.
01:17:37.636: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
01:17:38.137: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION FAILS.
01:17:41.010: >> Mayor Taylor: I BELIEVE IF MY RECORDS ARE CLEAR, NOW WITH RESPECT TO MR. GORDON AT THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION. DISCUSSION? MR. GORDON'S APPOINTMENT IN COMMISSIONER GORDON'S APPOINTMENT?
01:17:54.090: >> Councilmember Eaton: SURE.
01:17:54.724: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
01:17:56.059: >> Councilmember Eaton: SO SIMILAR TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION, THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION WILL BE INVOLVED IN THE REVIEW OF THE TRANSPORTATION ELEMENT OF OUR MASTER PLAN AND I BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE DIVERSIFY THE POINT OF VIEW ON TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION. SO I WILL BE OPPOSING THIS. FURTHER DISCUSSION. COUNCILMEMBER GRAND?
01:18:21.984: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. MR. GORDON IS A CONSTITUENT OF MINE. THE FIRST TIME I MET HIM, HE WAS ON HIS BIKE. I THINK IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN WINTERTIME. HE'S A LOBBYIST FOR THE STATE SIERRA CLUB. HE'S SOMEONE WHO EVERY SINGLE DAY THROUGH ALL SORTS OF WEATHER, LAST SUMMER MADE IT HIS MISSION TO GET DEMOCRATS, PARTICULARLY WOMEN, ELECTED TO THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE, AND WHO -- WHO -- I DON'T THINK REALLY MISSED A DAY, RAZZ REALLY OUT RECEIVEN DAYS A WEEK -- WAS REALLY OUT SEVEN DAYS A WEEK IN SUPPORT OF PROGRESSIVE WOMEN AND PROGRESSIVE POLICIES. HE IS SOMEONE WITH HIS WIFE, LISA LUMBOLD OVERCAME SOME OBSTACLES AND SELF-FUNDED OUR FIRST CURBSIDE E.V. CHARGER IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD OF PITTSFIELD VILLAGE THAT THEY ARE WILLING TO SHARE WITH THEIR NEIGHBORS BECAUSE A RENTER OF THEIRS AND THEY ALSO WANTED TO PURCHASE AN ELECTRIC VEHICLE BUT THEY DIDN'T HAVE A DRIVEWAY. SO THEY WORKED WITH STAFF TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY COULD HAVE THAT TRANSPORTATION OPTION WHEN THEY WEREN'T USING NON-MOTORIZED OR TRANSIT. I THINK HIS PERSPECTIVE IS INCREDIBLY VALUABLE ON THIS COMMISSION. HE'S CERTAINLY RESPECTED BY HIS PEERS BY THIS COMMISSION AND I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED TO SEE HIM BEING PUT IN THIS POSITION BECAUSE I THINK HE'S DONE EXCEPTIONAL WORK.
01:20:00.817: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
01:20:01.750: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  I ALSO WILL BE SUPPORTING THE REAPPOINTMENT OF COMMISSIONER GORDON. BUT I -- HE TOO IS A CONSTITUENT OF MINE. I FIND HIM TO BE A PASSIONATE AND DEDICATED COMMISSIONER AND VOLUNTEER IN ALL. HIS WALKS. WALK -- IN ALL OF HIS WALKS. MR. GORDON LIVES IN UP WITH OF OUR NEIGHBORHOODS. IT'S THE FARTHEST EAST AREAS OF TOWN, AN AREA OF TOWN THAT HAS CONSIDERABLE TRANSPORTATION CHALLENGES, PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO WALKING AND BICYCLING. AND THAT UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE IS INCREDIBLY VALUED. THE SOUTHEAST AREA OF TOWN, AND PARTICULARLY THE FARTHER -- THE FAR EASTERN REGIONS OF THE SOUTHEAST SIDE OF TOWN HAVE LONG FELT NEGLECTED BY CITY HALL AND A LOT OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH OUR TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE. AND MR. GORDON'S SERVICE, AND PERSPECTIVE IS INCREDIBLY VALUABLE. AND DOES PRESENT THE DIVERSITY OF THOUGHT IN THAT HE UNDERSTANDS THAT PART OF TOWN AND THE CHALLENGES THAT PART OF TOWN FACE. AND I WILL BE GLAD TO VOTE FOR HIS REAPPOINTMENT, I THINK HE HAS A LOT LEFT TO GIVE THE CITY.
01:21:24.433: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
01:21:27.770: >> Councilmember Hayner: JUST A QUESTION, HE SERVED ONE TIME AND NOW IT'S EXPIRED, JUST THE ONE?
01:21:36.979: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
01:21:37.479: >> Councilmember Hayner:  ONE TWO-YEAR TERM.
01:21:39.081: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THE COMMISSION WAS ESTABLISHED --
01:21:40.783: >> Councilmember Hayner: YES, THIS IS THE RECENT. THANK YOU.
01:21:43.886: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
01:21:47.256: >> Councilmember Griswold: THIS IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME TO SAY, BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT, AND WHAT I'M GOING TO READ HERE IS SOMETHING THAT WAS POSTED TO FACEBOOK THAT WAS BROUGHT TO THE MAYOR'S ATTENTION. I CONSIDER IT TO BE EXTREMELY UNPROFESSIONAL, AND IF I FOUND SOMETHING LIKE THIS BY A FELLOW COUNCILMEMBER, I WOULD ALSO BRING IT TO THE MAYOR'S ATTENTION. AND WHAT WAS WRITTEN BY ROBERT GORDON REFERRING TO RONNIE PETERSON, WHO IS OUR ONLY AFRICAN-AMERICAN STATE REPRESENTATIVE FROM WASHTENAW COUNTY. AND ME AS THE SHE, SHE HAD THE MOST MORE RONIC LEGISLATOR INTRODUCE IT LAST YEAR. NOW IS IT APPROPRIATE OR PROFESSIONAL TO REFER TO ONE OF OUR LEGISLATORS AS THE MOST MORONIC? I FOUND THIS EXTREMELY TROUBLING. I BELIEVE THAT IF A PERSON WHO WORKED IN ANY MAJOR CORPORATION IN THE UNITED STATES MADE THIS TYPE OF STATEMENT THERE WOULD BE DISCIPLINARY ACTION.
01:22:54.523: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
01:22:59.761: >> Councilmember Hayner: YEAH. THANK YOU, COUNCIL WOMAN BRINGI. IT'S -- THAT'S A LEGITIMATE CONCERN. WE SPOKE EARLIER ABOUT THE IDEA THAT, YOU KNOW, THESE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE INTIMIDATED AND SAY WHATEVER THEY WANT AND FREE SPEECH. I'M A BIG FREE SPEECH FAN. I THINK THE ANTI-CULL FOLKS KNOW THAT. I SUPPORTED THEM ON THEIR EFFORTS EARLIER. [ APPLAUSE ] I GUESS I'M AN '80s RAP GUY, FREEDOM OF SPEECH, BUT WATCH WHAT YOU SAY. THEY SERVE THE CITY BY PROXY. THISTHEY ARE APPOINTED BY US. AND THEY ARE ACTING ON OUR BEHALF. THAT'S A LIGHTWEIGHT THING TO SAY. I HAVE SEEN A LOT WORSE FROM SOME OF THE OTHER FOLKS BUT THAT'S NOT GOOD. I'M DISAPPOINTED TO HEAR THAT. THANK YOU.
01:23:58.686: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
01:24:11.799: >> Councilmember Eaton: NO.
01:24:12.399: >> Councilmember Nelson:  NO.

01:24:27.915: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
01:24:28.415: >> Clerk Beaudry: THE MOTION FAILS. WITH RESPECT NOW TO COMMISSIONER WEATHERBEE --
01:24:33.888: >> Councilmember Ackerman: POINT OF ORDER. COMMISSIONER WEATHERBEE SERVES ON THE ZONING BOARD OF APPEAL BY THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
01:24:41.662: >> Mayor Taylor: ARE YOU 100% --
01:24:43.297: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  I CAN BE FACT CHECKED.
01:24:46.100: >> Councilmember Lumm: I ACTUALLY DID RECEIVE AN EMAIL FROM THE CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE, CONFIRMING THAT OR I THOUGHT --
01:24:52.640: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THAT THE CASE? FAIR ENOUGH THEN.
01:24:56.811: >> Councilmember Lumm: I DID ASK A QUESTION.
01:24:59.614: >> Councilmember Eaton: IT WAS MY FEAR IF I LEFT IT IN THE MAIN MOTION, THAT -- SO WE DON'T NEED TO VOTE ON THIS IS YOUR POINT?
01:25:06.087: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN MY POINT, YES. CAN WE GET CONFIRMATION THAT THAT IS TRUE. I'M NO YOU QUESTIONING MYSELF.
01:25:15.329: >> City Atty. Postema: IF MR. McDONALD WROTE THAT AND HE'S UPSTAIRS
01:25:18.243: >> Councilmember Ackerman: HE WILL COME RUNNING DOWN.
01:25:20.913: >> City Atty. Postema: THAT IS RUNNING DOWN.
01:25:22.447: >> Councilmember Lumm: I HAVE AN EMAIL.
01:25:24.449: >> Mayor Taylor: SO IF THAT TURNS OUT TO BE INCORRECT, WE WILL PICK IT UP LATER.
01:25:28.787: >> City Atty. Postema: AND TONIGHT, THERE'S A LOT MORE THAN MR. McDONALD LISTENING UPSTAIRS.
01:25:33.892: >> Mayor Taylor: NO DOUBT. IT'S A COMFORT KNOWING THAT THEY ARE THERE. FAIR ENOUGH. I ALSO HAVE A RESOLUTION WITH RESPECT TO DAVID BLANCHARD NOT HOUSING AND HUMAN SERVICE BOARD FOR CONSIDERATION AT OUR NEXT MEETING. WE NOW COME TO CONSENT AGENDA. MAY I HAVE A MOTION TO APPROVE THE CONSENT AGENDA. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER NELSON AND SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM. DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] ALL OPPOSED? THE CONSENT AGENDA IS APPROVED WITH TEN COUNCILMEMBERS PRESENT, ALL VOTING IN THE AFFIRMATIVE, SATISFYING THE EIGHT VOTE REQUIREMENT WITH RESPECT TO CA-1 AND CA-4. WE NOW COME TO A SET OF PUBLIC HEARINGS. PUBLIC HEARINGS ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO SPEAK TO COUNCIL AND THE COMMUNITY ABOUT A SPECIFIC ITEM ON THE AGENDA. THE SPECIFIC ITEM OF THAT PUBLIC HEARING, THAT IS TO SAY YOUR SPEECH MUST RELATE TO THE SPECIFIC ITEM OF THE AGENDA, THE SPECIFIC PUBL   HEARING. SPEAKERS DO NOT NEED TO HAVE SIGNED UP IN ADVANCE. SPEAKERS HAVE THREE MINUTES IN WHICH TO SPEAK. SO PLEASE PAY CLOSE ATTENTION THE TIME CLOCK. AS A MATTER OF COURTESY, WE ONLY HAVE ONE PERSON SPEAKING AT A TIME. AND IF YOU REQUIRE ASSISTANCE IN SPEAKING BEFORE COUNCIL, WE WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO PROVIDE IT TO YOU.

NO NEED TO RAISE YOUR HAND. JUST MOSEY ON UP.
01:27:04.613: >> POINT OF ORDER.
01:27:06.349: >> Mayor Taylor: IF WE CAN ASK YOU TO --
01:27:10.252: >> City Atty. Postema: I INCORRECT SAID THAT MR. McDONALD WAS INVOLVED IN THIS. ATTORNEY CROSS DID PROVIDE ADVICE AND HE SAID THE ADVICE THAT WAS PROVIDED WAS NOT -- HE CAN GIVE THAT ADVICE ON THE APPOINTMENT IT.
01:27:25.568: >> IT IS A SEPARATE AND INDEPENDENT APPOINTMENT. THE ONE DOES NOT DEPEND ON THE OTHER.
01:27:30.439: >> Mayor Taylor: FAIR ENOUGH THEN. THANK YOU. IF YOU CAN HOLD OFF ON THE --
01:27:39.482: >> Councilmember Grand: I MOVE TO OPEN THE AGENDA.
01:27:42.752: >> Mayor Taylor: MOVED BY GRAND AND SECOND BY HAYNER. ALL IN FAVOR. [CHORUS OF AYES] THE AGENDA IS REOPENED. WE ARE MOVING BACK TO.
01:27:57.966: >> MC-1.
01:27:58.267: >> Mayor Taylor: DISCUSSION OF GETTING BACK TO MC-1. ALL IN FAVOR. IT'S APPROVED NOW. VEST -- OR RATHER, THE DISCUSSION WITH RESPECT TO COMMISSIONER WEATHERBEE ON THE ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS. IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER AND LUMM.
01:28:18.754: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I HAD THE PLEASURE OF MEETING MS. WEATHERBEE'S FOLKS A COUPLE OF WEEKS AN AND TOOK A GREAT RE IN THE CITY JUST LIKE THEIR DAUGHTER DOES. AND IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING SHE SERVED SEVERAL TERMS ON ZBA; IS THAT CORRECT? DOES ANYBODY HAVE A SENSE OF THAT? IT'S BEEN -- SHE'S BEEN ON AND OFF OF IT FOR A WHILE. WE SPOKE AFTER AN ADU PLANNING COMMISSION MEETING AND SHE SPOKE TO HER LONG KNOWLEDGE OF THE ZBA.
01:28:48.350: >> Mayor Taylor: I DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION IN FRONT OF ME.
01:28:52.221: >> Councilmember Hayner: DOES ANYONE HAVE AN IDEA OF HOW SERVED.
01:28:58.930: >> Mayor Taylor: MY UNDERSTANDING IS THIS IS THE FIRST. WE WILL GET THAT INFORMATION FOR YOU RIGHT AWAY. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
01:29:05.937: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANKS. I WANT TO APOLOGIZE FOR -- I JUST SEARCHED FOR CITY ATTORNEY FROST'S EMAIL ABOUT THESE REAPPOINTMENTS, THIS PARTICULAR REAPPOINTMENT, AND IN WHICH IT WAS -- THE ADVICE WAS THAT MS. WEATHERBEE WOULD NEED TO BE APPOINTED TO BOTH THE PLANNING COMMISSION AND THE ZBA AND THAT STATE STATUTE PERMITS ONE MEMBER THE ZBA TO ALSO BE I AMEMBER OF THE CITY PLANNING COMMISSION. SO I MISINTERPRETED THAT, OBVIOUSLY. SO --
01:29:38.570: >> Councilmember Ackerman: AS DID I. YOU WERE NOT ALONE.
01:29:40.905: >> Councilmember Lumm: OKAY. THANKS.
01:29:49.080: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? GETTING THAT INFORMATION.
01:29:52.951: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I APOLOGIZE FOR NOT FIGURING THAT OUT. I'M CURIOUS.
01:29:58.790: >> Councilmember Lumm: HOW MANY TERMS.
01:30:00.391: >> Mayor Taylor: WE HAVE A START DATE OF MAY 17. MAY 2017.
01:30:06.998: >> Councilmember Hayner:  OH, OKAY.
01:30:08.265: >> Mayor Taylor: ON THE ZBA. THAT'S FROM THE CLERK. ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER -- COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
01:30:30.354: >> Councilmember Eaton: NO.
01:30:30.955: >> Councilmember Nelson:  NO.
01:30:31.923: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES.
01:30:34.759: >> Councilmember Hayner:  NO.
01:30:36.360: >> Councilmember Bannister: NO.
01:30:38.596: >> Councilmember Griswold: NO.
01:30:42.566: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES.
01:30:43.167: >> Councilmember Grand: YES.
01:30:43.768: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES.
01:30:46.604: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
01:30:47.105: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION FAILS.
01:30:49.941: >> Mayor Taylor: WE NOW COME TO -- I GUESS I HAVE TO REOPEN THE PUBLIC     HEARING. Y'ALL REMEMBER THE RULES OF PUBLIC HEARING? [ LAUGHTER ] I WILL BE FORGIVING BUT  OU BE COOL, I WILL BE WITH PUBLIC HEAG NUMBER ONE, RESOLUTION NUMBER 4, CONFIRMING NORTHSIDE STEAM SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOL SIDEWALK GAP SPECIAL ASSESSMENT ROLLS. WOULD ANYONE LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING? IT'S ALL YOU.
01:31:18.200: >> MY NAME IS CHUCK MARSHALL, I LIVE ON THE TRAVER BLOCK. FIRST OFF, I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME A CHANCE TO SPEAK WITH YOU. I KNOW YOU HAVE A THANKLESS JOB BUT I APPRECIATE THE TIME. THE SAFE ROUTE TO SCHOOL, I'M ASKING THAT YOU VOTE NO FOR THE SPECIAL ASSESSMENT ROLE. THE REASON IS THAT YOU ARE NOT REALLY VOTING FOR SAFETY. THERE ARE SAFE ROUTES ALREADY EXISTING. THOSE SAFE ROUTES HAVE BEEN USED BY STUDENTS TODAY. THIS HE HAVE BEEN USED FOR -- THEY HAVE BEEN USED FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF DECADES AND THEY WILL BE USED IN THE FUTURE, THE EXISTING ROUTES ARE SIDEWALKS. THEY ARE PAVED SIDEWALKS BE SHORT ROUTES. ACTUALLY, QUITE INTERESTINGLY, OR ONE THE ROUTES THAT STUDENTS ARE WALKING ON TODAY IS APPLE STREET. APPLE STREET WAS REMOVED FROM THE PROJECT. SO THERE WON'T BE SIDEWALKS THERE. BUT SIDEWALK SAFETY IS THE CONCERN. THE REAL ISSUE WITH SAFETY THAT ISN'T GOING TO BE ADDRESSED BY SIDEWALKS IN THIS PROPOSAL IS THIS INTERSECTION HERE AT BARTON AND TRAVER. THIS HAS BEEN USED AS A DROPOFF ZONE BY COMMUTING STUDENTS NOT STUDENTS THAT LEAVE IN THE AREA BUT STUDENTS OUTSIDE THE AREA. STEAM HAS BROUGHT IN A LOT OF GREAT STUDENTS FOR THE -- FOR THE EDUCATION AND THIS IS GREAT, BUT THAT INTERSECTION IS DANGEROUS. THE SIDEWALKS AREN'T GOING TO FIX THAT PROBLEM. THAT PROBLEM WILL STILL EXIST AND WE'LL SPEND A LOT OF MONEY ON SIDEWALKS TO FIX A PROBLEM WHERE WE'LL STILL HAVE A SAFETY ISSUE. SO I WOULD LIKE TO ASK THE COUNCIL TO VOTE NO AND TO ASK THE PROJECT LEADERS TO GO BACK AND FIND A BETTER SOLUTION. ONE THAT ADDRESSES THE SAFE CONCERN. THANKS.
01:32:50.856: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OH, SIR. THERE WAS A -- THERE WAS A RULE AND REQUEST THAT I DID NOT RAISE. I THINK FOR PURPOSES OF STATE LAW IN CONNECTION WITH THIS PUBLIC HEARING, IF YOU COULD BE SO KIND AS TO SIGN IN, I BELIEVE THERE'S SOMETHING FOR YOU RIGHT THERE.
01:33:11.209: >> OH, SURE.
01:33:13.711: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE A PAPER?
01:33:15.046: >> NO.        T ACCIDENTALLY.
01:33:23.281: >> Mayor Taylor: YOU, YOU, YOU!
01:33:26.385: >> MR. MAYOR, IS THIS IT.
01:33:30.523: >> Mayor Taylor: WAS THE NAME ON THE RECORD SUFFICIENT?
01:33:43.836: >> THE POWER OF GOOGLE.
01:33:46.872: >> Mayor Taylor: MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE STATEMENT OF YOUR NAME ON THE RECORD TURNS OUT TO BE SUFFICIENT BUT THANK YOU FOR SIGNING IN. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING?
01:34:03.589: >> HELLO, EVERYBODY. MY NAME IS AMY CHIVAS, I LIVE ON THE 1600 BLOCK OF TRAVER AND THANK YOU FOR LETTING US DISCUSS THIS     AGAIN. I HAVE BEEN -- I WILL LEAN INTO A PHRASE THAT I HAVE HEARD A COUPLE OF TIMES TONIGHT IS LACK OF TRAHE PROCESS AND THAT WAS SORT OF MY TASK TO GO BACK THROUGH AND DO A LITTLE TIME TRAVEL AND LOOK BACK THROUGH THE PROJECT HISTORY ANDF KEY POINTS HERE. AN 11/18/2013, COUNCIL APPROVED R-13-369, ADOPTION OF A 2013 UPDATE TO NON-MOTORIZED TRANSPORTATION PLAN, WHICH INCLUDES -- WHICH INDICATES SIDEWALKS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE TRAVER FROM JOHNNY WOODS TO BARTON. NONE OF US KNEW ABOUT ANYTHING. THE RESIDENTS DID NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT. I WILL SKIP AHEAD TO 10/20/2016, WALKING AUDIT WITH STUDENTS, PARENTS, TEACHERS AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANTS FROM MISCH MAMICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY. THE STAKEHOLDERS, THE RESIDENTS OF THAT PRODUCT BLOCK WERE NOT D IN THAT. WE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THAT. 11/10/2016, MEETING GIVING PARENTS, TEACHERS AND ADMINISTRATORS TO VOICE CONCERN ABOUT WALKING ROUTES. AGAIN, THE RESIDENTS OF 1600 BLOCK OF TRAVER WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THAT. I WILL JUMP AHEAD. 3/18/17, MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY CONCEPT DRAWING OF SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOL INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS RECEIVES. 5/3/2017, MEETING THREE, GATHERING COMMUNITY INPUT, NO INPUT FROM THE 1600 BLOCK. I WAS A LITTLE -- I MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT OF AN ANOMALY, BECAUSE I ACTUALLY DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT -- I WAS SORT OF LEFT OFF THE MAILINGS AND HEARD FROM MY NEIGHBOR ACROSS THE STREET ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING AFTER I WAS TRAVELING LAST SUMMER. I HAVE A LONG EMAIL THREAD WITH JANE ALLEN, THE ENGINEER ASKING HER WHY I WAS NEVER INCLUDED ON ANY OF THE EMAIL THREADS AND SHE FINALLY DID INCLUDE ME, BUT THAT WAS NOT UNTIL20 SO IT'S -- I JUST WANT TO GO BACK THROUGH THAT TIME LINE. IT'S ALL ON THE -- ON THE WEB. IT'S NOT SOMETHING I JUST■■ CONCOCTED. TO NOTE -- TO LET YOU ALL KNOW THAT THIS REALLY -- WE DO THINK THIS COULD BE A REALLY WONDERFUL PROJECT AND IT'S NOT -- NOT IN MY BACKYARD ISSUE FOR US. WE ARE REALLY CONCERNED THAT IT DOES NOT ADDRESS THE ISSUES OF TRAVER AND BARTON. I KNOW ANECDOTAL INFORMATION MAY NOT REGISTER AS STRONGLY FOR EACH OF YOU. I CROSS THA THAT INTERSECTION ALMOST EVERY DAY, WALKING MY DOGS. THEY BLOW THROUGH BARTON AND BLOW THROUGH THE FOUR-WAY STOP SIGN. I SEE CARS PARKED UP TO THE EDGE AND I SEE KIDS DROPPING THEIR KIDS OFF INTO THE STREET AND SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOL INCLUDES MANY OTHER THINGS BESIDES THE SIDEWALK PLAN. THANK YOU.
01:37:16.475: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
01:37:21.447: >> HELLO. MY NAME IS SCOTT NEWEL, I LIVE AT 1621 TRAVER, PART OF THE COMMUNITY THAT'S AFFECTED BY THIS SR SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOL. AFTER   STU PROPOSAL WHICH I FEEL TO BE EXTREMELY FLAWED FOR A BETTER PART     COME UP WITH THIS   OBSERVATION. STEAM SCHOOL CREATED AT A NO COST TO THEM SCHOOL -- NO COST TO THE SCHOOL SOLUTION FOR THEIR PARENT DROPOFF    BLEM. STEAM COULD GET SE SAFE ROUTES O SCHOOL T ORDER TO SERVE AND PRIORITIZE A PARENT DROPOFF FOR THE SCHOOL. TH  E LOCATION PR PRIORITIZES TE USES FOR T  VER ROAD AS A SCHOOL DROPOFF POINT OVER ALL CURRENT USES THAT TRAVER PROVIDES. CURRENTLY TRAVER IS A MODERATE  LY QUIET, TREE-SHADED STREET YET WELL-USED AS A COMMUT  ER AUTO CORRIDOR, AND COMMUTER BICYCLE CORRIDOR AND A COMMUTER WALKING CORRIDOR. IN ADDITION, TRAVER ROAD PROVIDES RESIDENTIAL ONSTREET PARKING, SUNDAY SCHOOL CHURCH PARKING AND RESIDENTIAL WALKING CORRIDOR FOR THOSE THAT LIVE THERE. AND RECENTLY, A DROPOFF SPENT FOR PARENTS OF STEAM. THE CURRENT GRANT WOULD NEGATIVELY REDUCE THE COMMUNITY BENEFITS THAT TRAVER PROVIDES HE ROAD IN ORDER TO PRIVILEGE STEAM PARENT DROPOFF. AND THE CURRENT GRA    NT DEDICATES -- WELL, IN ORDER TO DO THAT, WE HAVE TO LOSE TREES, PARKING ACCESS, CHURCH, WALKING, BIKING, AUTO ACCESS, IT WILL BE ALTERED, RESTRICTED AND IT'S UNACCEPTABLE. WE WANT OUR TREES. WE WANT OUR PARKING. WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO GET IN OU  R CAR IN WINTER STORMS. HE WANT TO DRIVE IN THIS UNIQUE PART OF TRAVER WHERE THE ABOVE SPECIFIC USES ARE A RESULT OF ACTUAL T TOPOGRAPHY OF THE STREET. IT'S A ROAD CUT. THANKS FOR YOUR TIME.
01:39:27.541: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
01:39:31.879: >> HELLO, MY NAME IS LESTER WYBORNE. SO YOU THINK THE SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOL WOULD TARGET IMPROVING THE MOST AMOUNT OF KIDS POSSIBLE. THIS PROJECT DOES NOT DO THAT. I WILL FOCUS ON TRAVER BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE 80% OF THE COSTS IS. TWO KIDS LIVE ON TRAVER AND ONE OF THEM IS MY KID. AND TW      S LIVE CLOSE TO THE END OF THE STREET BY THE SCHOOL'S A DROPO  FF LOCATION FR KIDS. THERE IS A SIDEWALK THERE ALREADY FOR THAT PART OF THE SCHOOL PROPERTY, WHERE BOT   MY KID AND THE KID ACROSS THE STREET AS WELL AS T  FF DROPOFF KIDS CAN USE. FOR THE REST OF THE BLOCK, THERE'S NO KIDS WALKING TO SCHOOL CURRENTLY. COULD THAT CHANGE? COULD FAMILIES MOVE IN? THAT'S POSSIBLE. I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT, IT'S A LOW HOUSE DENSITY BLOCK. THEREFORE, THE CHANCES ARE THEY ARE NOT GOING TO BE A LOT OF KIDS ON THAT STREET EVER BECAUSE THERE'S TOO MANY -- TOO FEW HOUSES. ALSO, AS HAS BEE OUT BY CHUCK'S MAP, THE KIDS WILL NOT WALK DOWN TRAVER FROM UP THE STREET. THERE'S A SHORTER ROUTE TO SCHOOL. I WANT T  O POINT OUT THAT THE SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOL REPORT DOES NOT SHOW TRAVER AS A PRIMARY ROUTE TO SCHOOL FOR SCHOOL CHILDREN. THEN YOU MIGHT SAY, WELL, IF THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS WITH CHILDREN BEING HIT, THEREFORE WE SHOULD FOCUS ON IT ANYWAYS. THAT'S NOT THE CASE. THE MICHIGAN CRASH DATA -- ACCESS WEB PAGE, SHOWS THERE'S NO PEDESTRIAN INJURIES IN THE LAST 12 YEARS THAT THEY PUT THAT WEB PAGE INFORMATION UP ON THE WEB    . BESIDES THE LOW BENEFITS, THE COSTS ARE VERY, VERY HIGH. IT'S AROUND 515     A FOOT, THAS EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE TO PUT SIDEWALKS ON TRAVER AND $200 A FOOT FOR OTHER SIDEWALKS. WHY WAS TRAVER PICKED? WE ARE SPENDING $1 MILLION ON A FEW OTHER TREATS BUT MOSTLY ON TRAVER AND Y  ET THERE'S VERY FW KIDS WHO BENEFIT FROM THIS. HOW COULD THE MONEY BE BETTER SPENT? WELL, THE TRAVER SIDEWALKS COST THREE TIMES MORE THAN THE OTHR SIDEWALKS SO WE COULD COVER THREE TIMES AS MANY SIDEWALK GAPS IF WE REPURPOSE THAT MONEY TO OTHER SIDEWALKS. I THINK THAT WAS POINTED OUT APPLE AND PEAR STREETS WERE REMOVED AND THEY ARE HIGHER DENSITY AND LOWER COST STREET ANDNE OF MY PARTNERS WILL TALK ABOUT. BROOKSIDE INN AND PEAR AND APPLE WERE REMOVED AND BROOKSIDE WAS KEPT IN. I MOVE THAT THIS SHOULD BE VOTED DOWN AND BETTER   IMPACTFL PROJECT BE DEVELOPED. WHAT HAPPENED? THIS WAS A FAILURE AN A PROCESS TO PRIORITIZE THE GREATEST NEEDS FOR THIS PROJECT. UNDER VISION ZERO, THE CITY IS COMMITTED TO GATHER ANALYZE AND SHARE RELIABILITY DATA TO UNDERSTAND TRAFFIC SAFETY ISSUES AND PRIORITIZE RESOURCES TO REDUCE TRAFFIC INJURIES. I WILL SAY WITH CONFIDENCE THAT DID NOT HAPPEN. FEDERAL LAW REQUIRES THAT, AND WE NEED TO PRIORITIZE THESE PROJECTS SO WE CAN MAXIMIZE THE SAFETY OF THE KIDS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
01:42:34.306: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
01:42:51.624: >> I'M JOHN WILLIAMSON AND I CAME TO TALK ABOUT THE BROOKSIDE PART OF THIS PROJECT. AND I WOULD LIKE TO TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT. THIS IS MY NEIGHBORHOOD. THIS IS PONTIAC TRAIL AND BARTON DRIVE. AND I WANT TO TALK ABOUT EVERYTHING WEST OF PONTIAC TRAIL AROUND THE SIDE STREETS HERE WITHIN THE DASHED LINES. WITHIN THOSE BLUE DASHED LINES, THERE ARE 114 HOUSES. 11 OF THEM, YOU SEE LITTLE SPECKLES OF YELLOW, 11 OF THEM HAVE SIDEWALKS IN FRONT OF THEM. AND WE -- THE REMAINING 103 DO NOT HAVE SIDEWALKS IN FRONT OF THEM. AND I'M ONE OF THE THREE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN TOLD WE WILL BE INCLUDED ON THIS PROJECT. SO EACH OF US WILL BE PAYING THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FOR SIDEWALKS THAT OFFER NO MEANINGFUL IMPROVEMENT TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD. SO THERE WILL BE 100 HOUSES ON THESE STREETS THAT STILL WILL NOT HAVE SIDEWALKS. BUT YET WE ARE BEING ASKED TO SHELL OUT HARD-EARNED MONEY FOR, I THINK, A NET ZERO GAIN, PRETTY MUCH:  IT HAS BEEN DUBBED THE SIDEWALK TO NOWHERE BY SOME PEOPLE. I MEAN, EVEN BARTON DRIVE, ALL ALONG THIS SIDE OF THE BARTON DRIVE, NO SIDEWALKS AT ALL. AND BARTON DRIVE IS A MUCH, MUCH BUSIER STREET THAN THESE RESIDENTIAL OLD NEIGHBORHOODS. I SOMEHOW WAS -- IT WAS NOT÷ INCLUDED IN THE PROJECT. AND THIS WAS NO COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT AND HAD TO HAVE BEEN OTHER IDEAS MIGHT HAVE COME UP. BUT THEY HAVEN'T. AND ALL I'M SUGGESTING IS AS THE PROJECT AS PLANNED SHOULD BE VOTED DOWN AND THEN WE RETURN TO THE TABLE AND COME UP WITH A BETTER SOLUTION. THAT'S IT. THANK YOU.
01:44:52.912: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
01:45:20.106: >> HI, MY NAME IS JANET HOLLOWAY AND WE LIVE AT 701 BROOKSIDE. SO I WILL BE SPEAKING MAINLY ABOUT OUR PARTICULAR SITUATION. WE FIRST LEARNED ABOUT THIS PROJECT, THIS SIDEWALK GAP PROJECT AT A MEETING AT THE SCHOOL IN JUNE OF 2018. AND THIS WAS AFTER STRS -- SRTS AND THE CITY WERE WELL INTO THE PLAN AND THE PROCESS. WE HAD MANY CONCERNS AT THAT MEETING AND WE STILL FEEL THAT THESE CONCERNS HAVE NOT BEEN ADDRESSED. FIRST OF ALL, WE JUST COULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY WAS OUR SHORT BLOCK OF BROCKSIDE CHOSEN FOR THIS PROJECT. THIS DID NOT MAKE SENSE TO US. WE ARE NOT EVEN CLOSE TO THE SCHOOL. IN FACT, THEY ARE NOT SIDEWALKS FURTHER WEST OF US ON BROOKSIDE AND THERE ARE NO SIDEWALKS ON NORTH SIDE AVENUE WHICH IS CLOSER TO THE SCHOOL AND SOUTH OF US. AFTER MANY MONTHS OF OBSERVATION, WE DID NOTICE ON MOST DAYS THAT THERE WERE TWO BOYS WALKING WITH AN ADULT ON OUR STREET IN THE MORNING AND THE AFTERNOON. WE DO NOT SEE THE NEED TO SPEND THIS GRANT MONEY FOR SIDEWALKS ON OUR SHORT BLOCK. THERE'S BEEN NO EVIDENCE TO US FROM THE SCHOOL OR FROM THE CITY AS TO THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS THAT USE BROOKSIDE AS A ROUTE TO THE SCHOOL. WHEN I ASKED HOW MANY STEAM STUDENTS WALK UP AND DOWN BROOKSIDE, THE ANSWER I RECEIVED FROM SRTS IS IF THERE ARE SIDEWALKS, KIDS WILL WALK TO SCHOOL. WE OBJECT TO THE PROPOSED SPECIAL ASSESSMENT WHICH FOR US IS OVER $6,000. THIS IS HIGHER THAN OUR COMBINED WINTER AND SUMMER TAX BILLS, AND THIS IS A SUM THAT IS SIGNIFICANT ON A FIXED INCOME. INSTEAD, WE BELIEVE THAT THERE'S BETTER USE OF THIS GRANT MONEY, AND IT WOULD BE TO FOCUS ON SOME TRUE SAFETY CONCERNS, ESPECIALLY AT THE INTERSECTION OF BARTON DRIVE AND PONTIAC TRAIL AND ALSO TO CONCENTRATE ON IMPROVING THE TRAFFIC CONTROL AROUND THE SKI. THANK YOU.
01:47:52.224: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
01:48:09.805: >> I FORGOT TO SIGN IN.
01:48:11.674: >> Mayor Taylor: IF YOU GIVE YOUR NAME ORALLY, APPARENTLY YOU DIDN'T NEED TO PHYSICALLY SIGN IN.
01:48:17.813: >> OKAY.
01:48:20.215: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
01:48:21.383: >> HI, MY NAME IS LIBERALLY BROOKS AND I'M A RESIDENT -- LIBBY BROOKS AND I'M A RESIDENT OF THE 1600 OF TRAVER. IT'S BEEN MENTIONED BY MY MEMBERS AND COUNCILMEMBERS, THAT THIS IS IMPORTANT TO A THRIVING CITY. THIS PROJECT TRIED FOR THAT. THE SRTS COMMITTEE IS MADE UP OF PARENT VOLUNTEERS, AND THEY DID THEIR BEST TO INVOLVE THE STAKEHOLDERS THAT THEY KNEW OF, BUT THEY MADE A FATAL ERROR BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T INVOLVE THOSE WHO WOULD FOOT THE BILL AND WHOSE DAILY LIVES WOULD BE IMPACTED BY THE CHANGE THAT WAS CREATED BY THE ENGINEERING. ANN ARBOR IS SPECIAL BECAUSE WE HAVE A COMMUNITY OF SCHOOLS OF CHOICE, AND SO THE PARENTS WHO ARE INVOLVED IN THE SCHOOL ARE NOT NECESSARILY THE PARENT WHO LIVE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD AT THIS TIME AND AS YOU HEARD FROM OTHER PEOPLE, THERE'S VERY FEW ACTUAL CHILDREN AROUND US WHO ARE GOING TO THE SCHOOL. I AM A PARENT. MY DAUGHTER WILL ATTEND STEAM ABOUT THAT.D I'M VERY EXC BUT THE CHANGE TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF OUR STREET AS IT STANDS IS GOING TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT MY DAILY LIFE. OUR DRIVEWAY IS PRETTY MUCH IMPASSIBLE IN THE WINTER, UNLESS YOU HAVE FOUR-WHEEL DRIVE. AND WE RELY ON PEOPLE, OUR FRIENDS AND OUR FAMILY TO HELP US RAISE OUR CHILD, RIGHT? IT TAKE TAKES A VILLAGE BUT OUR VILLAGE DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE FOUR-WHEEL DRIVE. SO I ASK     TO PARK ON STREET. ASKING SOMEBODY TO BRING, YOU KNOW -- A LOT OF OUR FRIENDS ALSO HAVE   LITTLE AND ASKING YOUR FRIENDS TO PARK TWO BLOCKS AWAY AND BRING THEIR BABY AND BABY CARRIER, IT WILL MAKE -- IT WILL MAKE IT A LOT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US. I TRULY BELIEVE THAT IF THE SRTS COMMITTEE HAD REACHED OUT TO THE NEIGHBORS AT THIS TIME, YOU WOULDN'T SEE US HERE. WE WOULD HAVE COME TO A SOLUTION THAT WAS FAIR AND THAT WAS APPRECIATED BY ALL OF THE PARTIES AND IT'S ASHAME THAT SO MUCH TIME AND ENERGY HAS    SOW. BUT I DO THINK THAT IF YOU VOTE NO ON BOTH OF THE RESOLUTIONS TONIGHT, THAT WE WILL BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE SRTS COMMITTEE AND THE CITY ENGINEERING AND THE MICHIGAN FITNESS FOUNDATION AND WHOMEVER ELSE TO FIND A BENS EVERYBODY, ALL. STAKEHOLDERS, NOT JUST THE PARENTS, NOT JUST THE RESIDENTS BUT BOTH. AND I KNOW THAT THE -- THIS PROGRAM IS BEING USED AS SORT OF THE STEPPING STONE FOR REPRODUCING SRTS PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT THE CITY. AND SO IF WE DO WITH FULL INVOLVEMENT ALL OF ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS, IT'S A PROJECT WORTH REPRODUCING. THANK YOU. [ APPLAUSE ]
01:51:21.386: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING? [ OFF MICROPHONE COMMENTS ]
01:51:33.599: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
01:51:41.604: >> MY NAME IS TOM STOLEBERG, I LIVE AT I'M NOT IN THE SPECIAL ASSESSMENT, I'M A COUPLE OF BLOCKS AWAY. I'M ALSO ONE OF THE PEOPLE WOULDWHOIS THE TARGET FOR THIS . MY SON WENT TO NORTH SIDE STEAM FOR FOUR YEARS. WE HAVE A     DOG. SO I -- WE MORNING. IT WAS VERY SWEET. HALFWAY, PICK UP A FRIEND OF HIS, WALK THE REST OF THE WAY WITH THE DOG TO SCHOOL, AND WALK BACK. SO HE AND I HAVE BOTH WALKED THIS OVER A THOUSAND TIMES AND NOW THAT HE'S AT SKYLINE, THE BUS PICKS UP AND AT NORTH SIDE STEAM. SOW'S STILL WALKING IT. WE KNOW FIRSTHAND THIS IS NOT A ROUTE TO SCHOOL. THERE ARE SHORTER ROUTES. SOME OF THEM HAVE SIDEWALKS. THE ONES THAT DON'T HAVE SIDEWALKS, LIKE PEAR AND APPLE ARE NOT GETTING THEM BECAUSE THEY GOT PULLED OUT OF THIS. THIS BLOCK OF TRAVER, WE WOULDN'T WALK IT. GOES WAY DOWN HILL AND WAY UP A HILL AND YOU SAW THE MAP THAT PROVED THAT. I ALSO WANT TO MENTION JOHN A. WOODS INTERSECTION THAT YOU WILL SEE AT THE TOP LEFT OF THAT, THE BUILDER DIRECTLY ACROSS THERE, THAT FEEDS INTO TRAVER AND WHERE IT SAYS 1600, THERE'S A FOUR-LOT SPLIT THAT HAS BEEN APPROVED AND THERE'S A COMMON DRIVE, A DOUBLE WIDE DRIVE, I'M NOT SURE HOW WIDE BUT 200 FEEL OF SIDEWALK AND THERE'S A LOT OF GRATING THERE. THERE'S A 4-FOOT RETAINING WALL THERE NOW. THAT BUILDER IS WILLING TO WORK WITH THE CITY AND IMPROVEFE OF S NO POSITIVE RESPONSE IN TIME TO WORK WITH THE CITY BUT THAT THE SIDEWALKS ARE GOING TO GET PUT IN. HE WILL BE ASSESSED FOR THEM AND THEN AFTER HE DESTROYS THEM WHEN HE GRADES FOR HIS LOTS AND COMMON DRIVE, HE WILL HAVE TO PAY FOR A SECOND TIME TO PUT THEM BACK IN. AND THIS IS SOMEONE WHO IS OFFERING TO CREATE A SAFER INTERSECTION WHERE WE HAVE A HILLCRESTING RIGHT AT THAT INTERSECTION. IT'S VERY DANGEROUS. PEOPLE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THE DANGER THE BARTON AND THE TRAVER INTERSECTION AND BARTON WHERE YOU CROSS TO THE FRONT OF THE SCHOOL. YOU   KNOW, I SAT THERE AND WATCHED COMMUTERS GO BY, WHILE A GIRL STANDS IN THE CROSSWALK, WAITING TO CROSS TO SCHOOL AND SIX CARS ONE TIME WENT BY WITHOUT STOPPING. BARTON IS A COMMUTER ROUTE. I HAVE BEEN AT THE INTERSECTION OF TRAVER AND BARTON WHERE PEOPLE RUN THE STOPS JUST LIKE YOU HEARD. WHAT WE NEED FROM THIS PROJECT IS EFFECTIVE SAFETY MEASURES. ON A SCALE OF 1 TO 10, THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE SAFETY MEASURES OF THIS PROPOSED PROJECT ARE, ONE, THE COST IS A TEN. WE WILL SPEND ALMOST A MILLION DOLLARS OF TAXPAYER MONEY, NOT MY MONEY DIRECTLY, THEIR MONEY, IF YOU APPROVE IT, BUT OF TAXPAYER MONEY, AS A TAXPAYER. I DON'T WANT TO SPEND A MILLION DOLLARS. THAT'S NOT EFFECTIVE AND LEAVE A LOT OF OTHER SAFETY MEASURES WANTING. THANK YOU.
01:54:39.847: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING?
01:55:00.801: >> HI,  OOD EVENING. THANKS FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY. MY NAME IS KARLENE COLVIN GARCIA. I LIVE IN THE NORTH SIDE NEIGHBORHOOD AND BOTH OF MY CHILDREN ATTENDED THE ANN ARBOR -- THE NORTH SIDE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND THEN IT BECAME THE ANN ARBOR STEAM NORTH SIDE SCHOOL IN 2014. I WAS P.T.O. COPRESIDENT WHEN THE SCHOOL JUST BECAME STEAM AND WE SAW A HUGE INCREASE IN ATTENDANCE AND SINCE 2014, WITH WHEN IT FIRST BECAME A STEAM SCHOOL, IT'S FIRST YEAR. THERE WERE 355 STUDENTS. AND THEN THIS YEAR, THERE ARE 631 STUDENTS. THAT'S 70 ALMOST 80% IN STUDENTS. THE VEHICULAR TRAFFIC, THE CORRESPONDING VEHICULAR TRAFFIC IS VERY DENSE, ALONG WITH BARTON DRIVE AND PONTIAC TRAIL BEING CORRIDOR ROUTES FOR FOLKS GOING TO THE HOSPITAL, TO WORK, MANY OTHER PURPOSES THAT THEY ARE THOSE AREAS. THERE'S A DISTINCT NEED FOR AS MUCH -- AS MANY MEASURES AS POSSIBLE TO KEEP OUR CHILDREN SAFE WHEN THEY GO TO   AND FROM SCHOOL. I SPEARHEADED THE SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOL EFFORT AND WITH THE HELP OF VERY MANY PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY, NOT JUST PEOPLE WHO WERE -- ARE COMMUTERS TO THE SCHOOL, BUT ALSO PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THE COMMUNITY, WE HAVE PUT IN SO MANY DAYS, WEEKS AND MONTHS OF WORK INTO THIS. WE ARE NOW IN YEAR FIVE OF SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOL ACTIVITY, RELATED ACTIVITY, AND THE APPLICATION FOR THE MAJOR GRANT, THAT IS BEING CONSIDERED TONIGHT IS -- IS -- BEGAN IN 2016. THE FACTS THAT WERE PRESENTED TO YOU TONIGHT BY THE FOLKS WHO ARE BEING AFFECTED, THE PROPERTY OWNERS, ARE NOT QUITE CORRECT. AND I'M HOPING -- I'M REALLY RELYING ON YOUR HAVING BEEN INFORMED OF THE ACTUAL PROJECT IN THE FINANCIALS, AS WELL AS THE POPULATION. THERE'S OVER 85% OF THE STUDENTS WHO LIVE IN THE ATTENDANCE AREA THE SCHOOL WHO ATTEND THAT SCHOOL. SO IT'S NOT A PRIMARY COMMUTER -- EXTERNAL COMMUTER TRAFFIC THAT'S DRIVING THIS NEED. THE SIDEWALKS ARE PART OF THE WHOLE SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOL EFFORT, WHICH IS EDUCATION ENCOURAGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT.HE HAVE BEEN DILIGENTLY, YEAR AFTER YEAR, PUTTING -- PRESENTING TO OUR CHILDREN HOW TO BE SAFE PEDESTRIANS AND BICYCLISTS. IN THE NEXT WEEK, WE WILL BE TRAINING THE CHILDREN ON USING YELLOW OR ORANGE FLAGS TO CROSS THE INTERSECTION AT BARTON AND TRAVER. THAT WILL MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE TO BRING ATTENTION TO DRIVERS IN THAT INTERSECTION. HAVING A SIDEWALK ON TRAVE WILL HELP PARENTS FEEL MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE PARKING ON TRAVER AND DROPPING THEIR KIDS OFF AT THE SIDEWALKS THAT WILL BE HERE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR CONSIDERING THIS AND VOTING IN FAVOR OF THIS RESOLUTIONS.

THAT'S SOMETHING WHICH I'M HOPING AND EXPECTING THAT WE AS A COUNCIL THE SUPPORT GOING FORWARD, BUT NEVERTHELESS, COUNCIL -- COMMISSIONER APPLEYARD'S SERVICE ON THE COMMISSION HAS BEEN LONGSTANDING AND EXEMPLARY.

DC-14 PRIME RESOLUTION TO APPROVE A CONTRACT WITH LIBERTY SECURITY GROUP INC. FOR GUEST SERVICES, AT THE GUY C.LARCOM CITY HALL, IN THE AMOUNT OF $102,500. MOVED BY RAMLAWI AND SECONDED BY ACKERMAN. DISCUSSION OF DC-14. COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
02:27:55.719: >> Councilmember Grand: I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE THAT WE POSTPONE THIS TO THE NEXT COUNCIL MEETING, THE FIRST MEETING IN JUNE.
02:28:05.128: >> Mayor Taylor: MOVED AND SECONDED. COUNCILMEMBER RAM LAW?
02:28:07.431: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: I'M NOT SURE -- RAMLAWI.
02:28:10.701: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: I'M NOT SURE THERE'S A GOOD MEETING TO MISS. AND I UNDERSTAND THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF COUNCILMEMBER SMITH. THIS IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST MEETING WE HAVE, VOTING ON THE BUDGET AND WE ARE VOTING ON A LOT OF EIGHT VOTE, SEVEN VOTE ISSUES. I JUST DON'T FAVOR A POSTPONEMENT OVER THE ABSENCE OF ONE COUNCILMEMBER IN THE MIDST OF ALL THE OTHER VOTES WE ARE TAKING TONIGHT.
02:28:35.892: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE BOTH PONEMENT, COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
02:28:39.563: >> Councilmember Grand: I THINK THE TIMING IS, I THINK, COULD BE VIEWED AS SOMEWHAT QUESTIONABLE THAT COUNCILMEMBER SMITH SAID HE WASN'T GOING TO BE HERE AND THEN THE RECONSIDERATION CAME UP THE NEXT DAY. SO IN THE INTEREST OF KEEPING THIS ABOVE BOARD, I WOULD LIKE US ALL TO VOTE ON IT.
02:28:59.716: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
02:29:00.884: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU. I FIND THIS TO BE PERFECTLY ABOVE BOARD BECAUSE COUNCILWOMAN IN ELLIS NELSON CAP TO ME. I WAS ON THE SIDE THAT DIDN'T PREVAIL AND SHE MENTIONED WELL BEFORE THAT SHE WAS RECONSIDERING THIS AND SO I DON'T -- TO THROW THAT OUT THERE TO SAY I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY UNDERHANDEDNESS. I THINK COUNCILMAN SMITH'S, YOU KNOW -- IT'S FLIPPED INTO MY EMAIL AND I SAW IT. AND I THANK HIM FOR -- I WISH HIM WELL, BUT I DIDN'T -- I JUST -- I GOT TO SPEAK FRANKLY HERE, THAT I -- THE IDEA THAT WHEN THINGS MAKE IT TO THE AGENDA OR DON'T MAKE IT TO THE AGENDA OR BROUGHT FORWARD OR NOT BROUGHT FORWARD HAVE NEFARIOUS TIMING, I REJECT THAT NOTION. AND I JUST -- I DON'T THINK IT HAS ANYTHING TO DO. IF I COULD, I WOULD PUT OFF MY DEER CULL RESOLUTION, BECAUSE COUNCILMAN SMITH HAD SAID IN THE PAST THAT HE WAS NOT IN NAVORFAVOR OF THE CULL BUT I DOT GET NO BENEFIT, IN FACT, IT'S WORSE FOR THAT RESOLUTION FOR ME. WE ALL SUFFER WHEN PEOPLE ARE NOT HERE, AND, YOU KNOW, I APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERNS, COUNCILWOMAN GRAND, BUT I -- YOU KNOW, WE GOT TO TAKE THE GOOD WITH THE BAD AND I WON'T SUPPORT A POSTPONEMENT. LET'S GET ON WITH IT.
02:30:20.864: >> Councilmember Lumm: HAS IT BEEN SECONDED?
02:30:23.299: >> Mayor Taylor: IT HAS. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
02:30:26.536: >> Councilmember Lumm: SO THANKS FOR TELLING ME IT WAS SECONDED. I WON'T SUPPORT THE POSTPONEMENT BECAUSE I THINK THIS -- THE MOTION TO RECONSIDER THIS RESOLUTION WAS -- WAS IN THE AGENDA IN TIME AND SO I -- WE HAVE HAD ADEQUATE NOTICE, I BELIEVE, AND I WILL ALWAYS SUPPORT ANYONE'S RIGHT TO BRING -- AND I'M BAD FOR RECONSIDERATION. I DO THINK WE HAD ADEQUATE TIME TO -- TO -- TO UNDERSTAND THIS PROPOSAL THAT WAS PRESENTED TO US AT THE MAY 6th MEETING THAT THE PROPOSAL IS NOT BEING CHANGED. IT'S JUST RECONSIDERATION. SO THANK YOU.
02:31:12.816: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER EATON AND THEN --
02:31:15.819: >> Councilmember Eaton: THANK YOU. NORMALLY, I WOULD RESPECT A REQUEST FOR A POSTPONEMENT, ESPECIALLY IF THE ABSENT PERSON'S VOTE WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE, BUT PRESUMING THAT I BELIEVE VOTES THE SAME WAY THEY DID LAST TIME, EXCEPT FOR THE PERSON REQUESTING RECONSIDERATION, COUNCILMEMBER SMITH'S VOTE DOESN'T SNAKE ANY DIFFERENCE.
02:31:37.808: >> Councilmember Grand: THEN I WILL WITHDRAW IT.
02:31:38.942: >> Councilmember Eaton: AND SO I -- YOU KNOW, WHEREAS I WOULD NORMALLY DO IT, JUST OUT OF COURTESY, BECAUSE IT'S NOT GOING TO HAVE ANY IMPACT ON THE END RESULT, I THINK THAT I WILL BE OPPOSING THE POSTPONEMENT.
02:31:52.656: >> Mayor Taylor: I HEARD IT'S BEEN WITHDRAWN.
02:31:58.194: >> Councilmember Grand: IT'S WITHDRAWN.
02:31:59.295: >> Mayor Taylor: DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY OPPOSITION TO THE WITHDRAW? THE MOTION TO POSTPONE IS WITHDRAWN. FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN MOTION? COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
02:32:11.441: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU. MR. MAYOR, AS CITY COUNCIL, WE WEAR A LOT OF HATS. WE ARE REPRESENTATIVES OF OUR CONSTITUENCIES BUT WE ARE ALSO IN A LOT OF WAYS THE BOARD OF THE ORGANIZATION THAT IS CITY HALL. AND AS I IN MY DAY JOB AS A MANAGEMENT CONSULTANT GO FROM CLIENT TO CLIENT, ORGANIZATIONS MUCH SMALLER THAN OUR 750-EMPLOYEE ORGANIZATION HAVE SECURITY BECAUSE IN THIS DAY AND AGE, THAT'S PART OF DOING BUSINESS, IS THE REALITY THAT WE DON'T LIVE IN A SAFE A WORLD AS WE ONCE DID. I THINK WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION AS THE BOARD OF CITY HALL TO -- TO GIVE OUR STAFF THE COMFORT AND THE PEACE OF MIND TO DO THEIR JOBS PROFESSIONALLY EVERY DAY. AND I THINK THIS IS A SMALL PART OF THAT. I AM OPEN TO WHAT OTHER ALTERNATIVES. WE HEARD SOME PRELIMINARY PRICE BREAKDOWNS TWO WEEKS AGO OF WHAT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE TO OUTSOURCE THIS, WHICH WE WOULD BE DOING THROUGH THIS CONTRACT, OR INSOURCE IT THROUGH FULL-TIME CITY EMPLOYEES. AND THE PRICE COMPARISONS WERE JUST SO FAR OFF, THAT IT WOULDN'T BE FISCALLY PRUDENT TO BRING IT IN-HOUSE. IT ISN'T THE RIGHT JOB AT THE RIGHT PRICE. AND AS WE ARE ABOUT TO SEE, IN OUR -- IN THE COMING BUDGET, THE SIZE OF CITY STAFF IS GROWING AND WE SHOULD ALWAYS BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN WE DO GROW OUR FIXED COSTS THROUGH ADDING G FULL-TIME EMPLOYEES AND I DON'T SEE THIS AS AN AREA THAT WE DO THIS. IT WAS MY HOPE THAT PERHAPS SOMETHING THROUGH THE POLICE CADET PROGRAM WE COULD FIND THAT TOKING, BUT I UNDERSTAND THE VISION AND THE DIRECTION OF THAT PROGRAM IS GOING IN ANOTHER DIRECTION AND I APPRECIATE AND RESPECT POLICE LEADERSHIP'S DESIRE TO SEE THAT HAPPEN. SO I THINK THIS IS THE BEST AND MOST FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE WAY TO GIVE A LOT OF PEACE AND COMFORT TO THE PEOPLE WHO WORK ON OUR BEHALF EVERY DAY. AND I WILL BE GLAD TO SEE IT MOVE FORWARD.
02:34:20.103: >> Mayor Taylor: I HAVE GOT PEOPLE IN THE QUEUE. COUNCILMEMBERS LUMM, GRISWOLD AND GRAND. I WANT TO KEEP MY COMMENTS SHORT. WE HAVE MILES TO GO HERE. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
02:34:33.382: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR AND I OBVIOUSLY SUPPORT COUNCILMEMBER NELSON'S -- ANYONE'S RIGHT FOR THAT MATTER TO BRING SOMETHING BACK UP FOR RECONSIDERATION. BUT ON THIS, I WILL NOT BE CHANGING MY VOTE. SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS AGAIN TONIGHT. AT THE LAST MEETING, I VOICED TWO CONCERNS ABOUT THIS, FIRST ONE BEING THE RISK THAT THE ADDED SECURITY COULD RESULT IN CITY HALL BECOMING LESS WELCOMING TO RESIDENTS AND VISITORS. I STILL HAVE THAT CONCERN. SECOND, WAS THAT WE HAD THE PROCESS OF IT BACKWARDS, BUILDING THE FRONT DESK BEFORE HAVING THE CONVERSATION ABOUT THE ADDED SECURITY AND STAFFING, BUT THAT'S WATER OVER THE BRIDGE AT THIS POINT. THE REASON I VOTED YES AT THE LAST MINUTE AND VOTE YES AGAIN TONIGHT IS THAT COUNCIL'S PARAMOUNT CONSIDERATION HERE MUST TO BE PROVIDE EMPLOYEES IN AN ENVIRONMENT THAT THEY FEEL SAFE IN AND THAT TRUMPS MY CONCERNS. WE CAN SIT HERE TONIGHT AND ACT LIKE WE KNOW HOW TO BETTER ADDRESS THE EMPLOYEES SAFETY AND SECURITY CONCERNS OR EVEN QUESTION THE VALIDITY OF CONCERNS BUT I DON'T I DON'T THINK THAT'S APPROPRIATE. WE ARE TOLD THAT CITY HALL SECURITY HAS BEEN A STAFF CONCERN FOR SOMETIME, GIVEN THE ENVIRONMENT THAT WE LIVE IN AND PAST EXPERIENCE AT CITY HALL. I THINK IT'S A REASONABLE CONCERN. WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THERE'S A BILLING SECURITY WORK GROUP OF 22 EMPLOYEES WORKING ON THIS FOR A YEAR AND THEY HAVE WORKED ON THIS FOR A YEAR AND THIS IS PAY PRETTY ROBUST PLANNING PROCESS. WE ARE TOLD THAT THE STAFF RESPONSE TO THIS HAS BEEN OVERWHELMINGLY POSITIVE AND FOR ME THAT'S PRETTY COMPELLING. ANOTHER CONCERN THAT COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN JUST NOTED AND THAT HAS BEEN RAISED IS HIRING A SECURITY FIRM RATHER THAN STAFFING THE DESK WITH CITY EMPLOYEES. I THINK THERE'S GOOD REASONS THAT EMPLOYERS TYPICALLY DO OUTSOURCE THIS TO PROFESSIONAL SECURITY FIRMS AND THINK THAT OUTSOURCING AND THE NUMBERS SUPPORT THIS IS LIKELY TO COST LESS. ANOTHER STAFF RESPONSE INDICATED THAT THE CITY WOULD NEED TO HIRE AND TRAIN MULTIPLE STAFF MEMBERS LIKELY FOUR TO FIVE, TO COVER ALL THE REQUIRED SHIFTS AND PROVIDE BACKUP COVERAGE FOR SICK DAYS, VACATION, ET CETERA. SO ANYWAY, COUNCIL'S RESPONSIBILITY IS TO PROVIDE AN ENVIRONMENT OR OUR EMPLOYEES ARE AND FEEL SAFE IN. AND SO UNLESS THE INFORMATION WE HAVE BEEN GIVEN IS SIMPLY NOT ACCURATE, I BELIEVE THAT REJECTING THIS TONIGHT AMOUNTS TO NOT MEETING THAT RESPONSIBILITY. SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS AGAIN TONIGHT AND THANK YOU FOR LISTENING.
02:37:05.301: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
02:37:06.369: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I TAKE SAFETY VERY, VERY SERIOUSLY. PROBABLY MORE SERIOUSLY THAN MOST PEOPLE WOULD LIKE. I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE SECURITY OF THE BUILDING AND WELL-BEING OF OUR STAFF. I BELIEVE THIS WAS A SUBOPTIMAL PROCESS AND I THINK WE NEED TO TRULY GO BACK AND SAY, WHAT PROBLEM ARE WE TRYING TO SOLVE? BECAUSE WE ARE BASICALLY COMING UP WITH A SOLUTION, BUT WE HAVEN'T COMPREHENSIVELY IDENTIFIED WHAT THE SAFETY AND THE SECURITY ISSUES ARE IN THE BUILDING. AND FOR THAT REASON, I WILL BE VOTING NO TO GIVE STAFF AN OPPORTUNITY TO COME UP WITH A BETTER SOLUTION.
02:37:53.816: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNSEL MEMBER GRAND.
02:37:57.453: >> Councilmember Grand: IF THIS DOESN'T GO FORWARD, I SINCERELY HOPE THAT STAFF DOES COME BACK TO US WITH SOMETHING ELSE BECAUSE I HAVE HEARD FROM STAFF PERSONALLY WHO HAVE SAID, YOU KNOW, -- STAFF IS PUT IN AN AWKWARD POSITION WITH COUNCIL BECAUSE IT'S DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO NECESSARILY GO FORWARD AND EXPRESS THEY ARE OPINIONS FREELY ALWAYS IN TERMS OF SECURITY. IT PUTS THEM IN A TOUGH SPOT, BUT FROM WHAT I HAVE HEARD FROM STAFF, THAT THIS IS REALLY -- THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THEY FEEL IS IMPORTANT TO THEM. THAT'S WHY THEY SPEND TIME, AND, YOU KNOW, WE ARE HERE -- WE'RE IN AND OUT OF THE BUILDING BUT STAFF IT HERE EVERY DAY AND DOING THE WORK IN IMPLEMENTING THE POLICIES THAT WE PASS AND REALLY TAKING CARE OF ALL OF US IN THE CITY. SO WHEN I HEAR THAT STAFF DOESN'T FEEL SAFE, AND THAT THIS WOULD MAKE THEM FEEL SAFER, THAT IT -- THAT WE CAN DO IT AS A RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE PILOT AND THAT'S THE NICE PART OF OUTSOURCING THIS WE COULD EASILY TAKE ANOTHER TURN. BUT IT'S UPSETTING TO ME, TO NOT STAND BEHIND OUR STAFF, WHEN THEY MAKE THIS VERY MODEST ASK OF US TO FEEL SAFER. THE TRUTH IS THERE ARE, YOU KNOW, WE ARE NOT AS SAFE AS WE USED TO BE. ONE OF MY FRIENDS THEIR SON WAS HIDING BEHIND A BOOKCASE LAST WEEK IN COLORADO, AND IT'S -- IT'S -- AS MUCH AS WE WANT THIS TO BE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC, AND BALANCED, I THINK LOTS OF PEOPLE GET LOST IN THIS BUILDING TOO, AND HAVING SOMEONE THERE TO WELCOME THEM WHEN THEY WALK IN AND DIRECT THEM ON THEIR WAY IS AN ADDED BENEFIT, BUT MOSTLY THIS COMES DOWN TO WHAT STAFF WANTS AND THEY ASK SO LITTLE OF US. WOULD LIKE TO SUPPORT THEM IN THIS EFFORT.
02:39:42.925: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
02:39:43.926: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. QUICK QUESTION. WHERE IS THE FUNDING FOR THIS COMING FROM FOR THIS FISCAL YEAR, THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR SINCE WE ARE HERE IN THE BUDGET NIGHT? WHO IS PAYING FOR THIS? THIS GENERAL FUND DOLLARS.
02:40:02.644: >> City Admin. Lazarus: THESE ARE THE GENERAL FUND DOLLARS.
02:40:04.746: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WAS ON THE LOSING SIDE. WE HAD A BUNCH OF FUNCTIONS HERE. WE ARE ALWAYS IN AND OUT OF THE BUILDING AS COUNCILWOMAN GRAND SAID. I GOT TO TELL YOU, I -- IN MY BRIEF TIME DOWN IN THE LOBBY, AS I WAS COMING IN AND OUT OF EVENTS, I -- I GAVE DIRECTIONS TO ABOUT EIGHT PEOPLE OVER TWO DAYS. PEOPLE STANDING THERE STARING AT THE PLACARDS AND I WOULD SAY, WHERE ARE YOU GOING, MA'AM? WMA'AM? I HAVE TO PAY A PARKING TICKET. GO RIGHT THERE. I'M SURE COUNCILWOMAN NELSON'S HEAD IS GOING TO EXPLODE, BUT I WILL BE CHANGING MY VOTE TO SUPPORT THIS. [ LAUGHTER ] BECAUSE I LIVED THE LIFE OF A PERSON IN THE LOBBY THIS LAST WEEK AND I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW GRATEFUL THESE RESIDENTS WERE WALKING IN HERE TO FIND CITY SERVICES AND TO DIRECT THEM TO THREE OR WHAT STAFF COUNTER OR THIS OR THAT. I JUST -- I DON'T LIKE THE COST. I DON'T LIKE THE PROCESS. BUT I SEE THE BENEFIT.
02:41:08.643: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THAT'S LIVE TELEVISION. WOW!
02:41:19.254: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
02:41:21.490: >> Councilmember Lumm: ONLY BECAUSE I'M STARING AT THE RESOLUTION, THAT YOU ALL SAW. DON'T ASK ME WHAT I DID YESTERDAY, BUT THE RESOLUTION, JUST BECAUSE I'M STARING AT IT, JUST SO YOU KNOW AND OTHERS OUT THERE, THAT THE FUNDING FOR THIS IS GENERAL FUND, BUT IT'S FROM THE CITY ADMINISTRATION AREA, SAFETY UNIT, OPERATING BUDGET, AND SO IT'S FUNDED FROM FISCAL YEARS 2021-23 THE FLEET OPERATING BUDGET.
02:41:55.690: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
02:41:56.591: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, MAYOR TAYLOR. I VOTED AGAINST THIS THE FIRST TIME. I WILL VOTE AGAINST IT THE NEXT 100 TIMES. I THINK IT'S OFFPUTTING. I THINK IT'S A WASTE OF MONEY. I THINK IT WON'T MAKE THIS BUILDING ANY SAFER. I ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT THE RESPONSE TIME FOR EMERGENCY PERSONNEL, AND THERE WON'T BE A CHANGE. NO ONE IS GOING TO COME QUICKER TO HELP PEOPLE IN NEED. IF SOMEBODY WANTS TO COMMIT SOMETHING, AS WE ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS, I THINK UNFORTUNATELY, THEY'LL -- THAT PERSON AT THE DOOR THERE, WILL NOT DO ANYTHING TO DETER THAT THREAT. WE HAVE HOURS OF OPERATION THAT ARE WILDLY EXCESSIVE. I THINK UNTIL  11 P.M. MOST NIGHTS. I DON'T KNOW WHY WE NEED TO PROTECT THIS BUILDING 70, 80 HOURS A WEEK. THERE'S THREATS THAT EXIST EVERYWHERE, UNFORTUNATELY. I BET A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD LIKE PERSONNEL AND SECURITY WHERE THEY WORK. IT GOES UNFORTUNATELY WITH THE TERRITORY. I HAVE A HARD TIME SUPPORTING OVER HALF A MILLION DOLLARS FOR THREE OR FOUR YEARS THAT WILL NOT ADDRESS OR REDUCE THE THREAT. THANK YOU.
02:43:35.123: >> City Admin. Lazarus: MAY I ADDRESS THAT?
02:43:36.124: >> Mayor Taylor: I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE -- I WOULD -- I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE SAFETY AND THE SECURITY ISSUES, IF THERE'S STAFF THAT COULD COME ON UP AND -- D.C. MAYBE AS WELL? SO I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS -- IT'S -- THAT WE ARE AT THE END OF A LONG PROCESS THAT STAFF HAS DELIBERATED OVER THE SAFETY AND THE SECURITY ISSUES THAT THEY EXPERIENCE ON A DAY-TO-DAY BASIS IN THIS BUILDING, THAT THAT PROCESS HAS BEEN DELIBERATIVE AND SLOW AND CAREFUL AND IT'S INCLUDED CONSULTATION WITH INTERNAL SAFETY AND SECURITY.
02:44:16.498: >> YES, THAT'S CORRECT.
02:44:19.100: >> Mayor Taylor: CAN YOU PLEASE ARTICULATE THE PROCESS THAT THEY HAVE IDENTIFIED AND HOW THIS WILL ADDRESS THOSE SAFETY AND SECURITY ISSUES?
02:44:29.377: >> MY NAME IS JOHN FORNIER, THE ASSISTANT CITY ADMINISTRATOR. THERE'S BEEN A WORKING GROUP MEETING INTERNALLY IN CITY HALL COMPRISED OF A WIDE SECTION OF CITY STAFF FOR THE LAST YEAR THAT HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS PROJECT, GUIDED BY SOME OF OUR SAFETY LEADERS WITHIN CITY HALL, INCLUDING THE POLICE DEPARTMENT, DOUG FORSYTHE, OUR SAFETY MANAGER AND OUR EMERGENCY MANAGER, AS WELL AS THE FIRE DEPARTMENT. AND SO IT'S BEEN AN EXHAUSTIVE CONVERSATION. IT'S BEEN GUIDED BY SAFETY AUDITS THAT HAVE BEEN DONE OF THE BUILDING BY SAFETY DEPARTMENT, WHICH ARE DONE REGULARLY AND COMPREHENSIVELY, SO WE CAN BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT THE SAFETY ISSUES ARE IN THIS BUILDING, AND IT'S ALSO -- THIS BTHIS -- THERE'S BEEN A LOT INPUT FROM THE POLICE ABOUT WHAT TYPE OF SECURITY CAN BE ADDED TO THE LOBBY TO MAKE THE BUILDING SAFER. THE AREAS OF VALUE THAT WE ZEROED IN ON INCLUDE HAVING SOME TYPE OF ACCESS CONTROL TO THE UPPER FLOORS THAT THE PUBLIC CAN MEET WITH A FACE, AND WITH A PERSON. OKAY? BECAUSE RIGHT NOW, THERE'S OPEN ACCESS TO THE BUILDING THROUGHOUT THE DAY. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PUBLIC CAN STILL HAVE ACCESS TO THIS BUILDING. THIS IS THE PUBLIC'S GOVERNMENT. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IF PEOPLE ARE HERE TO DO BUSINESS, THEY HAVE AN EASY WAY TO GET UP TO THE FLOORS. BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S NOT A COMPLETE OPEN ACCESS, BECAUSE THAT CREATES A SECURITY RISK. SO WE DESIGNED THIS PROCESS, AGAIN IT'S A LONG CONVERSATION OVER THE COURSE OF MANY MONTHS, DESIGNED THIS PROCESS TO MAKE THE BUILDING WELCOMING, TO MAKE IT EASY TO ACCESS, BUT TO ALSO PROVIDE SOME LEVEL OF SECURITY FOR STAFF WHO IT IS NOT UNCOMMON FOR THEIR WORK TO BE INTERRUPTED BY MEMBERS OF PUBLIC WHO ARE GOOD NATURE AND LOOKING FOR HELP. BUT SOME ARE NOT. WE HAVE PEOPLE UNDER THE INFLUENCE AND WE HAD PEOPLE WHO APPROACHED STAFF MEMBERS IN A THREATENING WAY AND IT'S UNSETTLING. WHAT WE WANTED TO DO IN THIS PROJECT IS FIND A WAY TO PROVIDE SOME SOME SECURITY FOR OUR STAFF AND PROVIDE A STABLE WORK ENVIRONMENT FOR THE STAFF, WHILE STILL MAKING THE BUILDING WELCOMING AND OPENING TO THE PUBLIC. -- OR OPEN TO THE PUBLIC, EXCUSE ME. AND SO I WILL SAY IN MY CAREER IN PUBLIC SERVICE, THIS IS THE FIRST BUILDING I EVER WORKED IN THAT HAD NO KIND OF ACCESS CONTROL, AND THAT'S ACROSS MANY COMMUNITIES. AND SO WHAT WE PROPOSED IS BASIC REGIMEN FOR SAFETY AND SECURITY. WE FEEL IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR THE BUILDING AND TO CONFIRM THE ROUROOT OF THE MAYOR'S QUESTION. THIS WAS RESULT OF A LONG PLANNING PROCESS, THAT WAS GUIDED BY QUALIFIED STAFF WITHIN CITY HALL, WHO ARE SECURITY PROFESSIONALS AND WHO SPENT A LOT OF TIME AND EFFORT TO PUT THIS PLAN TOGETHER.
02:47:44.872: >> Mayor Taylor: D.C.?
02:47:45.373: >> I WOULD AGREE WITH EVERYTHING THAT HE JUST SAID. I CAME TO THE GROUP PROBABLY MIDWAY THROUGH THE PROCESS. AND WAS ONLY CRITICAL OF -- OPENLY CRITICAL OF WHAT IS THE PROBLEM THAT WE ARE TRYING TO SOLVE. AND I THINK IT'S BALANCING A CUSTOMER SERVICE AND OPEN ABILITY TO CONDUCT BUSINESS WHILE AT THE SAME TIME, PROVIDING WAY FINDING AND SOME LEVEL OF SECURITY FOR THE NONPUBLIC FACING PORTIONS OF THE BUILDING. SO SPECIFICALLY FLOORS THREE THROUGH SIX AND HOW DO WE HAVE SOME SORT OF ACCESS CONTROL TO THOSE PLACES IN THE BUILDING, WHERE THE GENERAL PUBLIC CAN -- AS IT IS RIGHT NOW, THEY CAN WANDER THROUGH THE BUILDING, AND AS JOHN SAID, LOOK FOR THEIR MEETINGS AND HAVE NO WAY TO FIND WHERE THEY ARE GOING AND ARE DISRUPTING REGULAR BUSINESS OPERATIONS. SO WHAT IS BEING PROPOSED IS RESTRICTING THE STAIRWELL AND THE ELEVATORS TO THE UPPER FLOORS AND HAVING PEOPLE TO CHECK IN AT A DESK AND VERIFY THAT THEY ARE HERE FOR LEGITIMATE BUSINESS AND THEN BE GIVEN ACCESS TO THOSE FLOORS.
02:48:50.637: >> Mayor Taylor: SO IT'S FAIR TO SAY WE DON'T EXPECT THE PERSON ON -- MEETING TO BE A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER TO BE, YOU KNOW, TRAINED IN MARTIAL ARTS. THEY ARE NOT THERE TO PHYSICALLY RESTRAIN PEOPLE. THEY ARE THERE TO CONTROL ACCESS TO FLOORS THREE THROUGH SIX WHICH PRESENTLY ARE UNRESTRICTED FOR ANY MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC TO WALK INTO DURING GENERAL ACCESS TO THE ENTIRE BUILDING?
02:49:15.662: >> RIGHT. I THINK IT'S -- IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION?
02:49:18.765: >> Counc
02:49:20.134: >> Councilmember Nelson: WELL MY QUESTION. WE HAD AN EXTENDED CONVERSATION WHERE WE WERE BOUNCING BACK AND FORTH AND I WAS TRYING TO WRAP MY HEAD THROUGH ALL THE SECURITY MEASURES AND HOW MUCH THEY RELIED ON THE LIVE PERSON AT THE DESK AND WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT RESTRICTING ACCESS TO THE FLOORS, LIKE THAT'S GREAT. AND WHAT I -- MAYBE I MISUNDERSTOOD THE METHOD OF SOMEONE GETTING ACCESS TO THOSE UPPER FLOORS. I THOUGHT THE IDEA WAS THAT THERE WOULD BE CALLING UPSTAIRS AND SOMEONE WOULD COME DOWNSTAIRS TO GREET THE PERSON. THAT PERSON SITTING AT THE DESK IS NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO GRANT THAT PERSON ACCESS TO THE UPPER FLOORS. SOMEBODY HAVE THE UPPER FLOORS IS GOING TO HAVE TO COME DOWN AND ESCORT THAT. DID I MISUNDERSTOOD THAT?
02:50:01.509: >> THERE'S AN I.D IT. SOLUTION. WHEN SOMEONE HAS A MEETING ON THE UPPER FLOOR, THAT'S COMMOODED THROUGH AN I.T. TO THE PERSON ON THE LOWER FLOOR. SO WHEN THEY COME, IN THE PERSON ON THE MAIN FLOOR BEHIND THE DESK WILL BE ABLE TO LOOK IMMEDIATELY ON A COMPUTER SCREEN AND SAY, YES, YOU ARE CREDENTIALED TO BE HERE AND GIVE THE CREDENTIAL WHICH GIVES THEM ACCESS TO THE FLOOR WHERE THEY HAVE THE MEETING. THE PERSON-TO-PERSON CONTACT IS IMPORTANT TO MAINTAINING THE ACCESS CONTROL, OTHERWISE, YOU KNOW, IT'S A VERY IMPERSONAL EXPERIENCE FOR SOMEBODY TO, YOU KNOW, WALK IN TO CITY HALL AND HAVE TO INTERFACE WITH THE COMPUTERIZED KIOSK OR PICK UP A PHONE, JUST AS COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER SAID, YOU KNOW, STAFF SEE PEOPLE EVERY SINGLE DAY. I RUN INTO HALF A DOZEN PEOPLE WHO ARE STARING AT THE, DID YOU KNOW, THE GUIDE NEXT TO THE ELEVATOR AND WHICH FLOOR DO I NEED TO GO TO? WE WANT TO ELIMINATE THAT PROCESS, GIVE SOMEBODY -- OR HAVE SOMEBODY THERE WHO A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC CAN SPEAK TO AND WHO CAN DO, THAT YOU KNOW CREATE THAT ACCESS CONTROL AND I ALSO WANT TO TOUCH ON ONE OTHER THING. IT WAS THE COMMENT ABOUT RESPONSE TIME FROM THE POLICE AND WHETHER THIS WOULD IMPROVE IT OR NOT, AND THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, IS AT A POINT WHERE A CALL GOES INTO THE POLICE FOR A POTENTIAL SECURITY CONCERN IN CITY HALL, THE POLICE ARE RIGHT NEXT DOOR. SO THE RESPONSE TIMES ARE STILL PRETTY QUICK. BUT OUR FEELING IS THAT HAVING SOMEBODY ON THE PL MAIN FLOOR, O HAS A PHONE OR A PANIC BUTTON. THEY CAN BE THE EYES AND EARS WITHIN THE MAIN LOBBY OF CITY HALL AND YOU ARE CUTTING DOWN ON THAT RESPONSE TIME. YOU ARE CUTTING DOWN ON THE RESPONSE TIME TO GET THE REPORT TO THE POLICE. THAT MATTERS. THAT CAN MAKE A TREMENDOUS DIFFERENCE FOR SECURITY IN THE BUILDING AND SO WE REALLY DO FEEL LIKE THERE IS A LOT OF VALUE NOT JUST ON THE SECURITY SIDE, BUT ON THE CUSTOMER INTERACTION SIDE, WHEN A CONSTITUENT AND A RESIDENT AND A CITIZEN WALKS INTO CITY HALL. WE WANT THEM TO INTERFACE WITH A LEARN SO THAT THEY KNOW WHERE THEY ARE GOING AND THEY CAN GET THE ADVICE AND THE DIRECTION THAT THEY NEED.
02:52:14.841: >> Mayor Taylor: QUESTIONS?
02:52:15.441: >> Councilmember Hayner: YES, THANK YOU. SO TO ADDRESS THE PROCESS, PROCEDURAL CONCERNS THAT I THINK ARE -- WE HAVE TO BEAR BECAUSE IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO SAY YES OR NO TO THE FUNDING FOR THIS. SO THIS GROUP MET AND YOU HAVE THE INTERNAL DISCUSSIONS AND SO ON AND THE PROJECT WENT FORWARD AND WHEN WE FOUND OUT ABOUT IT, THE DESK WAS BUILT. AT WHAT POINT DID IT SEEM -- WOULD IT SEEM PERHAPS IN FUTURE PROCESSES TO BE APPROPRIATE TO REACH OUT TO CITY COUNCIL AND SAY, HEADS UP, YOU WILL INBOUND FOR A HALF MILLION DOLLARS THE NEXT FOUR YEARS? I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON HERE, THERE'S A SENSE HERE -- I SENSE THAT PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE PROCESS.
02:52:57.684: >> AND I SENSE THAT TOO AND I WANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT CONCERN, THE DESK WAS BUILT PREMATURELY.
02:53:05.759: >> City Admin. Lazarus: I WILL DISAGREE WITH THAT. I WILL DISAGREE WITH THAT. THE SECURITY WAS DISCUSSED WITH THE FY '19 BUDGET.
02:53:11.264: >> THAT'S TRUE.
02:53:11.998: >> City Admin. Lazarus: AND THERE ARE TWO ASPECTS. YOU HAVE TO HAVE A CONTRACT. YOU HAVE TO HAVE A PLACE FOR THE PERSON TO BE STATIONED. TO THE TWO THINGS WERE DOB IN DN PARALLEL AND I THINK IT'S A REASONABLE ATO HAVE THOSE TWO THINGS TO BE DONE AT THE SAME TIME. YOU KNOW, CERTAINLY YOU ARE FREFREE TO DISAGREE WITH THAT APPROACH. WE ADDRESSED SECURITY LAST YEAR DURING THE BUDGET PROCESS. I DON'T THINK IT'S OUT OF SORT FOR US TO GO FORWARD AND IMPLEMENT THAT ONCE IT'S -- ONCE IT'S INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET.
02:53:50.237: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WASN'T HERE.
02:53:52.139: >> Councilmember Lumm: I WAS AND I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO IT.
02:53:54.741: >> Mayor Taylor: I'M GOING TO -- I'M TRYING TO STICK WITH THE QUEUE.
02:53:58.078: >> Councilmember Lumm: OKAY.
02:53:58.678: >> Mayor Taylor: DO YOU HAVE QUESTIONS?
02:53:59.679: >> Councilmember Lumm: I HAVE A COMMENT.
02:54:01.648: >> Mayor Taylor: I WILL B PUT YU IN THE QUEUE FOR A COMMENT. COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD, QUESTIONS.
02:54:11.557: >> Councilmember Griswold: WILL THERE BE ONE OR TWO PEOPLE AT THE DESK AT A TIME?
02:54:16.062: >> THE WAY THE CONTRACT IS ENVISIONED RIGHT NOW, THERE WOULD BE ONE PERSON AT THE DESK DURING MOST HOURS. THERE MIGHT BE SOME SMALL OVERLAP DURING SHIFT CHANGES. THAT PEACE ONE OF THE BENEFIT -- THAT'S ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF HAVING THIS AS A CONTRACTED SERVICE. YOU KNOW, IF SOMEBODY HAS TO BE OUT SICK OR IS OUT ON VACATION, OR TAKES A DAY OFF OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, THE CONTRACTOR GUARANTEES COVERAGE. AND IF THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE WERE DOING WITH INTERNAL STAFF, WE WENT HAVE THAT GUARANTEE. WE WOULD HAVE TO STAFF UP ABOVE AND BEYOND THE ACTUAL HOURS WORKED IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN COVERAGE.
02:54:50.864: >> Councilmember Griswold: SO A REAL SIMPLE QUESTION, WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE PERSON HAS TO GO TO THE BATHROOM OR TAKE A LUNCH BREAK? IS A STAFF MEMBER GOING TO COVER THE DESK?
02:54:59.272: >> THERE ARE STAFF AVAILABLE IN CITY HALL WHO COULD BE ASSIGNED TOEVER COULD THE DESK ON BREAK, -- TO COVER THE DESK ON BREAKS. THE WAY THE CONTRACT IS PUT TO GO, THE COMPANY HAS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT PEOPLE WOULD BE AN WORKING LUNCHES AT THE DESK, BUT IF THERE ARE INSTANCES WHERE SOMEONE WOULD HAVE TO BE STEPPED AWAY, YES, WE CAN FIND INSTANCES IN CITY HALL.
02:55:21.728: >> Mayor Taylor: OTHER QUESTIONS? THANK YOU BOTH. STILL HAVING THE FLOOR, I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY, THIS STRIKES ME AS A PERFECTLY REASONABLE SOLUTION TO A VERY REAL PROBLEM. STAFF HAS SPOKEN ABOUT CONCERNS THEY HAVE WITH RESPECT NO THE SECURITY AND THE SAFETY OF THEIR WORKPLACES, VERY REASONABLE CONCERNS OF THE SECURITY AND SAFETY OF THEIR WORKPLACES. AND IN MY VIEW, THE ONLY PROPER THING TO DO IS TO SAY YES. THIS HAS GOTTEN TO US AFTER A LONG DELIBERATIVE PROCESS, A CAREFUL PROCESS, A RESULT WHICH HAS BEEN PUTTED TOGETHER BY SAFETY AND SECURITY PROFESSIONALS, BY WORKPLACE PROFESSIONALS, AND THE -- I THINK IT'S INCUMBENT UPON US TO APPROVE IT. I HAVE COUNCILMEMBER NELSON, IF I HAVE IT CORRECTLY AND LUMM ON THE QUEUE?
02:56:14.114: >> Councilmember Nelson:  NO, I'M DONE. IT WILL BE A LONG NIGHT.
02:56:17.984: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES, JUST TO THE PROCESS. AS YOU KNOW, I RAISED THE CONCERN ABOUT BUILDING THE DESK FIRST AND THEN BEFORE HAVING THE DISCUSSION ABOUT THE NEW SECURSECURITY PROCESSES AND IT S BACKWARD TO ME. WE TALKED ABOUT SECURITY AS PART OF THE FISCAL '19 BUDGET BUT IT WAS NOT PRESENTED TO COUNCIL BECAUSE IT DIDN'T MEET THE COULD DOLLAR THRESHOLD. SO THE FIRST DOLLAR AMOUNT IN CITY HALL, AND IT WAS TO PROVIDE THE BALLISTIC PROTECTION AT THE FIRST FLOOR CUSTOMER SERVICE BUILDING PERMIT COUNTER AND SO THE UP FRONT COST FOR THOSE TWO, 36,000, THE ONGOING AND THEN THE THIRD IS REPLACING THE CLERK'S FRONT COUNTER AND THEN THE SIGN IN AND SIGN OUT FOR FLOORS THREE TO SIX, THAT'S, YEAH, WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT NOW. SO, I MEAN, HONESTLY, I HAVE TO SAY I DIDN'T THINK WE GOT A REAL ANSWER TO THE QUESTION WHY WE BUILT THE DESK FIRST, BEFORE WE -- BEFORE COUNCIL APPROVED THE CONTRACT IN THIS WHOLE NEW CONCEPT, AND I APPRECIATE THE ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THAT. WE WOULD TALK ABOUT THE CONCEPT AS A WHOLE, AND I DIDN'T SEE THAT WITH THE FISCAL YEAR '19 CONVERSATION EITHER. SO WE ARE WHERE WE ARE. IT'S WATER UNDER THE BRIDGE BEING REALLY, BUT IT'S -- YOU KNOW, HOPEFULLY IT'S A LITTLE LESSON LEARNED NEXT TIME WE DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS.
02:58:00.085: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? WE ARE NOW AT THE POINT WHERE -- WELL, PERHAPS A POSTPONEMENT, SINCE THE -- A POSTPONEMENT WOULD NO LONGER BE -- WOULD BE -- I WILL. YOU TELL ME. MY POINT IS PREVIOUSLY IT WAS 6-5 AND THEN IT WENT DOWN TO 5-6 WITH COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER ANNOUNCING HIS DIFFERENCE, IT'S 6-5 BUT THAT'S PREDICATED UPON THE VOTE OF A PERSON WOULD IS ABSENT. IF THERE'S SOMEONE WHO WILL EXPRESS THEIR SUPPORT FOR THE RESOLUTION, WE CAN GO FORWARD, HOWEVER IF THAT ISN'T THE CASE, I GUESS THE -- A REQUEST MIGHT BE TO POSTPONE IT SO THAT THE FULL BODY COULD CONSIDER IT AT OUR NEXT -- AT OUR NEXT MEETING. WHICH PREVIOUSLY WAS GOING TO BE MOOT, BUT IS NOW RELEVANT.
02:58:59.245: >> Councilmember Nelson:  OH, I FOLLOW. I FOLLOW WHAT YOU ARE SAYING. YES, I AGREE WITH THE POSTPONEMENT. I DON'T KNOW HOW WE REVERSE BACK. I'M SORRY THIS TOOK SO LONG.
02:59:10.656: >> Mayor Taylor: IF SOMEONEPREVIOUSLY VOTED NO OR EXPRESSED AN INTEREST IN VOTING NO WOULD EXPRESS SUPPORT, WE COULD GO FORWARD AND VOTE ON THIS. I'M NOT SEEING THAT. I THINK WE WILL GO TO POSTPONEMENT TO THE NEXT MEETING, COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN?
02:59:27.406: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  I WOULD MOVE TO POSTPONE TO THE FIRST MEETING IN JUNE.
02:59:32.478: >> Mayor Taylor: SECONDED BY? COUNCILMEMBER LUMM. DISCUSSION OF THE POSTPONEMENT. HACK >> Councilmember Hayner:  T WAS PUT FORWARD AND CALLED. I STILL DON'T SUPPORT A POSTPONEMENT.
02:59:53.899: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE POSTPONEMENT. ROLL CALL, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
02:59:58.638: >> Councilmember Hayner:  ON THE POSTPONEMENT.
03:00:00.640: >> Mayor Taylor: PARDON ME. THIS IS ON POSTPONEMENT.
03:00:05.310: >> Councilmember Eaton: YES.
03:00:05.911: >> Councilmember Nelson: YES.
03:00:07.046: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES.
03:00:09.782: >> Councilmember Hayner:  NO.
03:00:10.382: >> Councilmember Bannister: NO.
03:00:12.918: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES.
03:00:16.455: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES.
03:00:17.056: >> Councilmember Grand: YES.
03:00:17.657: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES.
03:00:19.358: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
03:00:19.859: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION CARRIES.
03:00:23.095: >> Mayor Taylor: DC-15, RESOLUTION TO AUTHORIZE PURCHASE OF CANOE FAN ART WORK AND APPROPRIATE $40,000 FROM GENERAL FUN UNOBLIGATED FUND BALANCE. MOVED BY LUMM AND SECONDED BY RAMLAWI. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
03:00:36.042: >> Councilmember Lumm: THIS RESOLUTION, RELATED TO THE CANOE FAN ART WORK AT GALA PARK AND I WOULD LIKE TO THANK CITY ATTORNEY CHRISTOPHER FROST FOR HIS HELP IN WORKING ON THIS. AND IN HIS MANY NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE ARTISTS. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI FOR HIS EVERIES INCLUDING PUSHING FOR A LOWER PRICE. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT RATHER THAN THE $45,000 THAT WAS MENTIONED THEY LAST MEETING OR THE $40,000 THAT'S REFLECTED IN THIS RESOLUTION TONIGHT, WE WILL BE REVISING THE RESOLUTION TO REFLECT THE $40,000. I SENT YOU AN AMENDMENT TO THIS RESOLUTION. SO I WOULD LIKE TO AMEND THE RESOLUTION, HOPEFULLY SINCE IT'S A LOWER PRICE TO THE CITY, IT WILL BE FRIENDLY TO THE BODY. FIRST I MOVE TO CHANGE THE CURRENT LAST RESOLVE CLAUSE TO, WHEREAS THE ARTIST HAS OFFERED TO SELL THE PIECE TO THE CITY AT THE REDUCED PRICE OF $35,000 BUT IS REQUESTING A RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL IF THE CITY DECIDED TO REMOVE OR DESTROY THE ART WORK, END QUOTE. SECOND, I MOVE TO ADD A NEW LAST WHEREAS CLAUSE THAT SAYS, WHEREAS THE CITY'S NORMAL PRACTICE AND STANDARD PURCHASE AGREEMENT FOR ART WORK RETAINS THE CITY'S RIGHT TO DISPOSE OF THE ART WORK AS IT SEES FIT, BUT NOT ALTER THE ART WORK WITHOUT THE ARTIST'S PERMISSION, END QUOTE. AND THEN FINALLY, I MOVE TO CHANGE THE $40,000 IN THE FIRST AND SECOND RESOLVE CLAUSES AND IN THE TITLE TO OF THE RESOLUTION TO $35,000.
03:02:03.462: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE A SECOND? SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI. IS THAT FRIENDLY TO THE BODY? FRIENDLY, COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
03:02:14.940: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANKS. AS YOU MENTIONED, LAST MEETING WE SENT STAFF OFF TO NEGOTIATE THIS PURCHASE, IT'S A UNIQUE SITUATION AND OPPORTUNITY TO KEEP A PIECE THAT'S IN A HIGHLY VISIBLE AND ACCESSIBLE LOCATION AT GA GALA PARK. IT'S ONE THAT'S CLEARLY ENJOYED BY VISITORS TO GALA. WE HAD HOPED THE ARTIST WOULD FIND A BUYER WHO WOULD DONATE THE POO PIECE BUT THAT WOULD NOT HAPPEN, AND IF WE DON'T APPROVE THIS TONIGHT, THE PIECE WILL BE REMOVED BY THE ARTIST AT THE END OF THE MONTH AND IN MY VIEW, AT LEAST, THIS WOULD BE -- THAT WOULD BE THE CITY'S AND THE PARK USER'S LOSS. SINCE THERE'S NO PROVISION IN THE FISCAL YEAR '19 BUDGET FOR THE PURCHASE, THE RESOLUTION WE PASSED LAST MEETING ASKED FOR A RECOMMENDED FUNDING SOURCE AND THIS APPROPRIATES $35,000 FROM THE GENERAL FUND BALANCE AND TRANSFERS THE MONEY TO PARKS TO MAKE THE PURCHASE. SO THANKS AGAIN TO STAFF, WHO HAVE HELPED ON THIS AND TO COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI. I'M HOPEFUL YOU WILL ALL AGREE THAT THIS IS A $35,000 INVESTMENT WORTH MAKING. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.
03:03:17.169: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAM LAWLY.
03:03:18.103: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, MAYOR TAYLOR AND COUNCILMEMBER LUMM ON THIS. YOU WENT TO BAT QUITE A BIT TRYING TO SECURE THIS PIECE OF ART, BEING THE LIAISON TO THE ARTS COMMISSION. I HAVE ALSO BEEN PAYING ATTENTION TO THE COMMUNICATIONS WITH CHRISTOPHER FROST. I APPRECIATE HIS WORK ON THIS AND DEALING WITH THE NEGOTIATIONS AND THE BACK-AND-FORTH COMMUNICATIONS AND I'M GLAD WE ARE ABLE TO SETTLE ON A LOWER PRICE. THAT'S -- I WAS NONSUPPORT OF THE $40,000. BUT SINCE WE HAVE AN AMENDED PRICE OF $35,000, I ASK THE CITY CLERK TO ADD ME AS A COSPONSOR TO THIS RESOLUTION. I FEEL IT'S A FAIR PRICE TO PAY TO KEEP A PIECE OF ART THAT THE COMMUNITY DOES LIKE, AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET OUR COLLEAGUES TO AGREE ON THIS, AND THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY.
03:04:16.762: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
03:04:19.998: >> Councilmember Eaton: I WANT TO THANK COUNCILMEMBER LUMM FOR DRIVING THIS PROCESS AND I WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A COSPONSOR, PLEASE.
03:04:26.337: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
03:04:31.510: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WOULD JUST LIKE SOME ASSURANCE FROM STAFF THAT THIS PIECE OF ART WORK WILL EITHER BE CONTAINED IN U.S. A WAY THAT CHILDREN WILL NOT BE CLIMBING ON IT, OR PREFERABLY THAT IT WILL BE MAINTAINED TO SAME STANDARDS AS STRUCTURES IN OUR PARKS.
03:04:58.002: >> City Admin. Lazarus: I THINK I CAN INSURE THAT IT WILL BE MAINTAINED IN A STRUCTURAL SOUND CONDITION AND WE WILL PUT APPROPRIATE SAFEGUARDS IN SO THAT IT'S NOT CLIMBED ON. REALIZING THAT A LOT OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE PARENTS CONTROLLING THEIR CHILDREN.
03:05:16.455: >> Councilmember Lumm: THEY LIKE TO TAKE PICTURES OF THEIR KIDS.
03:05:20.792: >> City Admin. Lazarus: AND THE CONCERN WAS THAT THIS NOT BE A PIECE OF ART THAT IS OFF LIMITS AND IT CAN BE ENJOYED BUT THERE'S A BALANCE THERE BUT WE WILL MONITOR AND POST SIGNAGE THAT IS APPROPRIATE.
03:05:32.804: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANKS.
03:05:33.438: >> Councilmember Griswold: WHEN I DID LOOK AT IT LESS THAN A WEEK AGO, THERE WERE PARTS MISSING, AND THERE WERE MANY SHARP OBJECTS, INCLUDING ONE OF THE CUTOUTS DID NOT HAVE THE FRAME AROUND IT AND SO IT WAS
03:05:46.017: >> City Admin. Lazarus: PERFECT THANK YOU FOR THAT.
03:05:51.790: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
03:05:54.726: >> Councilmember Grand: I WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A COSPONSOR AS WELL.
03:06:01.065: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED?
03:06:07.338: >> Councilmember Hayner: OPPOSED.
03:06:08.940: >> Mayor Taylor: WOULD YOU LIKE A ROLL CALL VOTE?
03:06:10.074: >> Councilmember Hayner:  NO, THAT'S FINE. I WOULD LIKE TO BE ON THE RECORD AS OPPOSING THIS PURCHASE.
03:06:14.278: >> Mayor Taylor: ABSOLUTELY. IT IS APPROVED WITH 10 COUNCILMEMBERS PRESENT, NINE VOTING IN THE AFFIRMATIVE WITH COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER IN OPPOSITION, THUS SATISFYING THE EIGHT VOTE REQUIREMENT. DS-1, RESOLUTION NUMBER 4, CONFIRMING THE NORTH SIDE STEAM SAFE ROUTES SCHOOL SIDEWALK GAP SPECIAL ASSESSMENT ROLL. MOVED AND SECONDED. DISCUSSION OF DS-1.
03:06:37.536: >> Councilmember Bannister: WELL, I DON'T THINK --
03:06:41.039: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
03:06:43.274: >> Councilmember Bannister: THINK WE TALKED ABOUT AT LENGTH. I THINK BASICALLY, IT HAS BEEN A SUBOPTIMAL PROCESS AGAIN. OUR RECURRING THEME, THE PROCESS GOT OFF TRACK AND IT DIDN'T SELF-CORRECT AND I THOUGHT ONE OF THE RESIDENTS MENTIONED THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING ON IT FOR FIVE YEARS AT THE P.T.O., BUT THE RESIDENTS IMPACTED WOULD NOT BE INVOLVED IN IT UNTIL JUST LAST YEAR. AND I'M URGING MY COLLEAGUES TO VOTE NO ON THIS AND GO BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD. AND I DO WANT TO UNDERLINE FROM MR. LAZARUS AND HIS STAFF THAT WE HAVE HEARD OVER AND OVER NOW THAT THE TRAVER AND  BARTON ROAD DROPOFF IS VERY DANGEROUS AND IT'S OF GREAT NEED. AND SO IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE SAFETY, WE NEED TO WORK ON THAT, AS THEY SAID, WE WILL HAVE CHILDREN OUT THERE WITH ORANGE FLAGS WHEN THEY ARE CROSSING THE STREET, BUT I THINK MAYBE WE CAN DO MORE ON THAT, AND SO BASICALLY, I JUST -- WE HAVE BETTER USE OF OVER $1 MILLION ON OTHER MORE URGENT TRAFFIC SAFETY CONCERNS. THANK YOU.
03:08:06.491: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCIL MEMBER HAYNER?
03:08:11.229: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. SO THE CONCERNS THAT THE RESIDENTS VOICED ARE MANY. I GREAT CHALLENGE HE WITH MANY OF THEM. AND I ALSO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT -- I UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS. I WASN'T IN THIS FROM THE VERY START, BUT I -- THEY WERE -- KARLENE AND THE FOLKS AT NORTH SIDE, SINCE I LOVE ACROSS THE STREET WERE KIND ENOUGH TO LET ME SIT IN ON THESE AND BE PART OF THE PROCESS AS MUCH AS I COULD. IT WAS A DECENT PROCESS. I WAS UNAWARE THAT MY NEIGHBORS RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET WERE NOT AWARE OF THIS, NOR WERE THE FOLKS ON TRAVER. SHAME ON ME FOR NOT DIGGING INTO THIS A LITTLE BIT MORE. OF COURSE, THIS WAS THREE OR FOUR YEARS AGO. I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH WHAT'S IN AND WHAT IS OUT ON THIS PROJECT. AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT -- THERE ARE SOME SERIOUS SIDEWALK GAP NEEDS IN THIS AREA AND WE MIGHT AS A BODY NEED TO CONSIDER CREATING OUR OWN ASSESSMENTS TO FILL THESE SIDEWALK GAPS. WHEN YOU LOOK AT, SAY, BETWEEN PONTIAC TRAIL AND APPLE, WHERE WE HAVE A BUS STOP AND A CROSS SIDEWALK THERE AND WE HAVE AN AVALON HOUSING COMPLEX AT THE END OF APPLE AND PEAR STREET AND DAY AFTER DAY, WE SEE PEOPLE GETTING OFF THE BUS AND WALKING DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET, OR TO THE BUS STOP. AND THAT SEEMS LIKE A GLARING GAP IN THE SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOL. ESPECIALLY AS A LOT OF KIDS, LIKE MY SON INCLUDED, USE THE PUB LIB TRANSPORTATION TO GET TO THE -- PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION, TO GET TO THE SCHOOL, TO AND FROM SCHOOL. I THINK THIS AS MANY FAULTS WITH THIS AS THERE ARE BENEFITS TO THE COMMUNITY AND I KNOW IT'S -- I KNOW IT'S BEEN A LONG, DRAWN OUT PROCESS, AND RESIDENTS ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS ISSUE HAVE BEEN PASSIONATE ABOUT IT AND ALSO HAVE BEEN GROCERY MISCHARACTERIZED TO THEIR MOTIVES. AND SO I JUST -- I -- I'M NOTING TO SUGGEST PEOPLE VOTE ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. BUT I THINK THERE'S A NEED FOR THIS KIND OF THING, BUT IT'S POSSIBLE -- ENTIRELY POSSIBLE WE ARE SENDING THE WRONG MESSAGE WHEN WE SEE THE SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOL GOES THE OTHER WAY, THAT NEIGHBORHOODS ARE NOT BEING NOTIFIED THAT ARE POTENTIALLY IN AN ASSESSMENT DISTRICT AND NOT BEING DRAWN INTO THE PROCESS PROPERLY. AND THAT'S A PROBLEM THAT EXISTS OUTSIDE OF THIS BODY AND OUTSIDE OF THIS TABLE, WITH POTENTIALLY -- POTENTIALLY WITH THE PROCESSES IN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM. AND SO I DON'T KNOW HOW WE FIX THIS. IF THIS IS THE POSTER CHILD FOR THE SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOL, WE HAVE SOME PROBLEMS. THERE ARE A LOT OF DISSATISFIED PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS ISSUE. I SAY THIS PUBLICLY TO PUT THE WORD OUT THAT IF YOUR SCHOOL IS CONSIDERING SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOL LIKE ANN ARBOR OPEN IS, WHERE MY DAUGHTER ATTENDS, GET IT RIGHT. REACH OUT TO THE COMMUNITY. MAKE SURE THAT THE SCHOOL WHO ARE THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARIES OF THESE PROJECTS, IS DOING THE RIGHT THING AND COMMUNICATING WITH THE NEIGHBORHOOD IN A WAY THAT ENGAGES EVERYONE FULLY IN THE PROCESS. THANK YOU.
03:11:33.564: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? I'M SORRY. COUNCIL MEMBER R RAMLAWI.
03:11:40.504: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, MAYOR TAYLOR AND THANKS TO MY COLLEAGUES IN THE FIRST WARD WORKING SO HARD ON THIS ISSUE. REALLY DOING WHAT ELECTED OFFICIALS OUGHT TO BE DOING, REPRESENTING THEIR CONSTITUENTS. AND FIGHTING THE FIGHT. YOU KNOW, EARLY ON WHEN THIS FIRST CAME TO COUNCIL, I WAS ONLY ON COUNCIL FOR WEEKS AT THAT TIME AND WE HEARD RATHER DIRE PREDICTIONS IF WE DID NOT GO A CERTAIN WAY WITH THIS, AND APPROVE THE ASSESSMENTS AND GO ALONG WITH THE PROJECT. AND LATER WE FIND OUT, MAYBE SOME OF THAT IS NOT NECESSARILY TRUE. AND THEN WE CONTINUE TO HEAR AND THE NEIGHBORS HAVE BEEN VERY VIGILANT AND ACTIVE IN PRESENTING THEIR CASE EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. I DO NOW SHARE SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT WERE BROUGHT ON EARLY THAT I DIDN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND AND I DIDN'T REALLY APPRECIATE, BUT THEN I REMEMBERED TO MYSELF, WHY AM I HERE? WHY DID I DECIDE TO JOIN CITY COUNCIL? I WAS AFFECTED BY SOMETHING THAT WAS PRETTY SIGNIFICANT,ISM PACKED ME QUITE A BIT, AND I WASN'T A PART OF THE PROCESS. I WAS LEFT OUT OF THE DISCUSSIONS. AND, YOU KNOW -- AND I -- AND IT -- ENGRAINED SOMETHING IN ME THAT CONTINUES TO THIS DAY. AND IT JUST SEEMS LIKE A REALLY FAULTY END RESULT WE GOT RIGHT NOW. AND WE'RE CHASING DOLLARS. WE ARE CHASING SOME COSTS. WE ARE CHASING GRANT MONEY. WE HAVE LESS THAN AN IDEAL OUTCOME ON TOP OF THE OTHER CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED. AND I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH NOT CUTTING MY LOSSES AND JUST DOUBLING DOWN ON MY PAST POUR AND COSTS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT INTO SOMETHING. AND I THINK, YOU KNOW, YOU'VE GOT TO KNOW WHEN TO CULT YOUR LOSSES. AND LOOKING AT THIS RIGHT NOW, I NO LONGER SUPPORT IT. AND SO I'M PUTTING THAT OUT THERE. I THINK WE WILL ACHIEVE BETTER RESULTS IF THIS GOES BACK AND WE COME BACK WITH A BETTER PLAN BECAUSE IT JUST -- I THINK WHAT'S MOTIVATING PEOPLE TO VOTE YES ARE FOR NOT NECESSARILY THE RIGHT REASONS. AND I'M NOT MOTIVATED BY IT ANY LONGER.
03:14:46.123: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
03:14:48.592: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WILL BE VOTING NO BUT IN STAFF'S DEFENSE, I WANT TO MENTION THAT THERE'S ALMOST A SEISMIC SHIFT IN WHAT'S HAPPENING IN LANSING, WITH THE NEW GOVERNOR. I HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE MICHIGAN DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION, ALSO ANOTHER ORGANIZATION THAT'S NOW EAGLE. AND ORGANIZATIONS THAT BEFORE SIMPLY SAID NO BEFORE YOU ASK THE QUESTION, ARE NOW VERY COOPERATIVE AND SO I THINK WE HAVE AN EXCELLENT CHANCE TO GO BACK AND HAVE ANYONE INVOLVED IN LANSING, THERE SEEMS TO BE A NUMBER OF ORGANIZATIONS THAT WORKED WITH US TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THE SAFETY FOR THE STUDENTS.
03:15:35.706: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM AND THEN ACKERMAN. LUMM THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. SO I -- I APPRECIATE HEARING WHAT EVERYONE THUS FAR HAS SAID ON THIS MATTER, AND IT'S HELPED TO SHED MORE LIGHT ON THIS FOR ME AS HAVE THE RESIDENTS WHO HAVE ADDRESSED US ABOUT THIS. I HAVE VOTED TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS SIDEWALK GAP PROJECT, AND THE RELATED ASSESSMENTS A COUPLE OF TIMES PREVIOUSLY. I H HAD RESERVATIONS BUT I THOUGHT THAT THE ASUGGESTED SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS AND THE ASSESSMENTS, THIS IS A SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOL INITIATIVE, ACCOMPANIED BY A GRANT AS WE ALL KNOW. I DO HAVE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK THAT THE SRTS GROUPS DO AND MS. CARLY AND COLEMAN GARCIA AS WE HEARD HER SPEAK TONIGHT, SHE DOES AN OUTSTANDING JOB, AND SHE REALLY THAT GRANT APPLICATION AND THAT REPRESENTS A GOOD PORTION OF A LIFE TIME'S WORK. SHE PUT SO MUCH EFFORT, AND I DID ASCEND SOME OF THESE MEETINGS AT NORTH SIDE, THE SECOND WARD. BUT I WAS ON COUNCIL, AND WE GOT INVITATIONS. AND I DID NOT REALIZE THAT THE IMMEDIATE NEIGHBORS WHO WOULD BE ASSESSED WERE UNAWARE OF THIS. I DO THINK THAT THE SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOL RECOMMENDATIONS ARE TECHNICALLY SOUND. AND THEY WOULD RESULT IN SOME GENUINE IMPROVEMENTS FROM THE PEDESTRIAN SAFETY, NOT ONLY AROUND THIS SCHOOL, BUT THE SCHOOLS IN GENERAL AND THAT WAS A HIGH PRIORITY FOR ALL OF US. RECENT EVENTS HAVE GIVEN ME CAUSE AND A COUPLE OF GENTLEMAN -- AND I APPRECIATE THIS, THEY SWUNG BY MY WARD TWO COFFEE LAST WEEK, AND WALKED ME THROUGH SOME OF THEIR CONCERNS AND THEN AFTERWARDS I DROVE AROUND THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND I WENT BACK OVER THE WEEKEND AND DROVE AROUND, WHICH IS VERY HELPFUL. I SHOULD HAVE DONE IT EARLIER. BUT YOU INSPIRED ME TO DO THAT. SO THANK YOU. AND I. SAY, YOU KNOW, I -- I -- AFTER DOING THAT -- AND ONE OF MY FRUSTRATIONS ALL ALONG IS THAT A COMPROMISE OF SIDEWALKS ON ONE SIDE OF THE STREET, RATHER THAN BOTH, WAS NOT SEVENNABLE AND AFTER I SAT THERE FOR A WHILE, AND LOOKING UP AND DOWN TRAVER AND DROVE AROUND THE NEIGHBORHOOD A BIT MORE, I'VE GOT TO SAY IT SEEMS TO BE A REASONABLE ALTERNATIVE, BUT THUS FAR, IT'S NOT BEEN ACCEPTABLE. AND THEN, ON BROOKSIDE, NOW I SEE WHAT YOU ARE SAYING ABOUT THE SIDEWALK TO NOWHERE. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THOSE COUPLE OF PARCELS WERE PLUCKED OUT AND ADDED IN, YOU KNOW, BAKED INTO THIS RECOMMENDATION. SO -- BUT ALSO, I'M AWARE THAT THERE'S A THREAT OF LEGAL ACTION AND IT'S NOT SO MUCH THAT, THAT'S BOTHERSOME FOR ME. I MEAN IT'S NEVER A WELCOMED DEVELOPMENT, OBVIOUSLY WHEN RESIDENTS FEEL COMPELLED TO SUE THE CITY. BUT IT SHOULD MAKE ONE STOP AND THINK, YOU KNOW, ABOUT WHY SOMETIMES THAT HAPPENS. AND -- BUT IF I BELIEVE THAT THE APPROPRIATE UNDERLYING ACTION IS APPROPRIATE AND SERVES THE GREATER GOOD, I WON'T BACK OFF THE ACTION SIMPLY BECAUSE OF A THREATENED LAWSUIT. BUT WHAT -- AND I WILL SAY IS MORE CONCERNING TO ME, IS SEEING THAT THE PROPER OWNERS REPRESENTING -- ABOUT 73% OF THE ASSESSED AMOUNTS ARE FORMALLY OBJECTING. AND -- AND TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST, YOU KNOW, THERE'S TYPTYPICALLY A FEW FOLKS WHO OBJECT TO ASSESSMENTS BECAUSE THIS IS HOW WE BUILD THIS INFRASTRUCTURE, BUT NO THE THREE-QUARTERS OF THEM, LIKE WE HAVE HERE. SO THAT'S VERY EYE-OPENING TO ME. SO OBVIOUSLY, I HAVE MIXED FEELINGS. I SEE BOTH THE POSITIVES OF ACCEPTING THIS GRANT AND MOVING FORWARD WITH A PROJECT THAT WILL IMPROVE THE PEDESTRIAN SAFETY IN THE AREA, BUT THEN THERE ARE THE VERY VALID CONCERNS EXPRESSED BY NEIGHBORS REGARDING THE SPECIFIC DESIGN AND THE IMPACT. SO -- THANK YOU.
03:20:04.541: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
03:20:05.842: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. THANK YOU TO COLLEAGUES FOR A LOT OF CONSIDERED THOUGHT. THANKS TO THE RESIDENTS FOR THEIR ENDURANCE AND THANKS TO STAFF FOR A LOT OF -- A LOT OF WORK IN ALL OF THIS. YOU KNOW, WE HAVE 21 ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS IN THE INNER PUBLIC SCHOOLS, SIX OF WHICH SIT IN THE THIRD WARD, SEVEN IF YOU INCLUDE CARPENTER, WHICH IS JUST ON THE OTHER SIDE IN THE TOWNSHIP. AND THE SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOL PROGRAM IDEALLY, YOU KNOW, GROWS IN A GRASS ROOTS MANNER TO EACH OF THOSE SCHOOLS. AND SO MY -- AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF FOLKS WOULD LIVE ACROSS TOWN, YOU KNOW, JUST ABOUT AS OPPOSITE AS YOU CAN GET IN TOWN, I -- I GET VERY CONCERNED ABOUT EFFECTS TO -- TO GRANT FUNDING IN THE PROGRAM OVERALL. SO IF I COULD ASK A COUPLE OF CLARIFYING QUESTIONS OF STAFF. I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S MR. HUPY OR MR. HUTCHINSON. OR MR. LAZ RUSS. -- LAZARUS. WE HAVE HEARD CONFLICTING INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO KIND OF OUR STATUS IN THE EYES OF MDOT SHOULD WE BE UNABLE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS. CAN YOU CLARIFY WHAT IF ANY EFFECT THIS WILL HAVE ON OUR ABILITY TO GET FUTURE GRANT FUNDING?
03:21:30.960: >> NICK HUTCHINSON, CITY ENGINEER. I WOULD LIKE TO CLARIFY THAT. WE HAVE ASKED THAT QUESTION OF MDOT. WE HAVEN'T GOT ON A SUPER CLEAR ANSWER ON THAT. IT MAY AFFECT OUR STATUS TO APPLYING FOR FUTURE TAP GRANTS WHICH SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOL IS UNDER THE TAP UMBRELLA. THEY HAVEN'T GIVEN US SPECIFICS ABOUT HOW THAT WOULD AFFECT US OR EVEN TRULY WHETHER IT WILL OR NOT. IT'S BEEN A -- JUST A COULD IS WHAT WE HAVE BEEN TOLD.
03:22:02.658: >> City Admin. Lazarus: PAST PERFORMANCE IS ONE OF SEVERAL FACTORS THAT'S EVALUATED AND IF YOU DON'T DELE DELIVER A PROJECT AFTER FUNDS ARE ALLOCATED, YOU REDUCE YOUR SCORE UNDER THE PASS PERFORMANCE EVALUATION. HOW MUCH THAT IMPACTS THE ABILITY TO GET AWARDS DEPENDS ON HOW COMPETITIVE THE GRANT IS. THERE ARE SOME GRANT PROGRAMS THAT ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, AND THAT WILL HURT US. THERE ARE SOME LIKE THE SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOL, WHERE IT WILL BE CONSIDERED, BUT OUR UNDERSTANDING IS BECAUSE THE PROGRAM HAS SO MANY RESTRICTIONS, SOMETIMES IT'S HARD TO GET PEOPLE TO APPLY. SO IT'S --
03:22:36.058: >> THAT IS CORRECT.
03:22:37.126: >> City Admin. Lazarus: SO IT'S HARD TO GET A DEFINITE YES OR NO ANSWER BECAUSE IT'S SITUATIONAL.
03:22:42.398: >> Councilmember Ackerman: SHOULD -- SHOULD THIS VOTE FAIL TONIGHT, WHERE WILL NORTH SIDE STEAM RETURN TO THE PROCESS OR THE CUE OF SCHOOLS THAT THE CITY WILL BE SUPPORTING IN THIS. WILL THIS FREE UP BANDWIDTH TO WORK WITH OTHER SCHOOLS OR WILL NORTH SIDE REMANE REMAIN AT THEF THE QUEUE.
03:23:07.023: >> THERE'S NOT A QUEUE, PER SE. THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENCE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT A CAPITAL-ESQUE SAFE RUDES TO SCHOOL GRANT SCHOOL, IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THEY ARE APPLYING FOR A SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOL GRANT. SO WE KIND OF USE BOTH TERMS FOR GOETTE THINGS. WE WILL CONTINUE -- FOR BOTH THINGS. WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND ANY PLACE WHERE WE CAN MAKE INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS, WHERE THINGS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED, WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT AND WE HAVE IDENTIFIED FUNDING TO BE WORKING ON SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS WITH SCHOOLS AND THIS WILL NOT NECESSARILY NECESSARILY -- THERE'S NOT A QUEUE TO SPEAK OF. THIS WAS SOUGHT OFF AS A SPECIFIC SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOL GRANT.
03:23:58.340: >> Councilmember Ackerman: FAIR ANSWER.
03:24:00.443: >> City Admin. Lazarus: MAY I ADDRESS ANOTHER ISSUE THAT WAS BROUGHT UP. THE ISSUE CAME UP ABOUT SIDEWALKS ON ONE SIDE OF THE STREET. I KNOW NICK REACHED OUT SEVERAL TIMES TO MICHIGAN FITNESS FOUNDATION, WHO ADMINISTERS THE PROGRAM, ON BEHALF OF M DOT AND HE WHO WAS TOLD THAT SIDEWALKS WOULD BE REQUIRED ON BOTH SIDES OF THE STREET. I TALKED TO MDOT THREE TIMES AND GOT THE SAME ANSWER. SO STAFF WERE STRONG ADVOCATES ON BEHALF OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD. WE ALSO THROUGH MS. ALLEN DID MULTIPLE DESIGNS TO ACCOMMODATE SOME OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD CONCONCERNS ALSO AND CAN STILL MAKE SOME CHANGES FOR -- TO ADDRESS PARKING SHOULD THIS SOMEHOW BE APPROVED. SO I THINK STAFF HAS BEEN RESPONSIVE THERE. I DON'T THINK COUNTER TO WHAT WAS STATED THAT STAFF EVERY INTENTIONALLY OR UN INTENTIONALLY MISLED ANYONE. I THINK IT WAS ACCURATE. SOMETIMES THINGS CHANGED DURING DESIGN. SO I WILL WILL BE CAUTIOUS THINGS THAT WERE SAID THAT WERE NOT EXACTLY TRUE. IT WAS A LITTLE HARSH OF A COMMENT AS WELL. THE LAST THING I WILL ADD THIS STARTED AS A GRASS ROOTS PROJECT THERE. WAS A BREAKDOWN IN COMMUNICATION IN THAT EVERYBODY IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD DOESN'T HAVE CHILDREN IN THE SCHOOL. WE HAVE WORKED WITH THE SCHOOL DISTRICT, THIS HAS BEEN MENTIONED AS A PILOT. YOU LEARN THINGS FROM P PILOTS AND WE WORKED WITH THE SCHOOL DISTRICT AND SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOL PROJECTS ARE NOW A ROUTINE PART OF THE TRANSPORTATION SAFETY COMMITTEE MEETINGS THAT ARE HELD KIND OF MONTHLY WITH THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM. SO THAT LESSON WAS LEARNED AS WELL. BUT IN THE END, IT'S REALLY NOT STAFF'S PLACE TO CHOOSE SIDES WHEN PEOPLE INVOLVED IN A NEIGHBORHOOD TAKE DIFFERENT SIDES IN A -- OVER A PROJECT AND THAT'S -- YOU KNOW, WE DID THE BEST WE CAN TO FIND ACCURATE AND TIMELY INFORMATION TO COUNCIL FOR YOUR DELIBERATION.
03:26:10.639: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
03:26:11.674: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I HAD A QUESTION FOR MANY MR. HUTCHINSON. SORRY. THANK YOU. I CERTAINLY HAVE NOTHING BAD TO SAY ABOUT STAFF. YOU KEEP CHANGING AND SHUFFLING AROUND THE DRAWINGS. SO I THANK NOW FOR YOUR EFFORTS. THE TAP GRANTS WHICH ARE A DECENT AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT COMES TO THE CITY FOR VARIOUS PURPOSES, I UNDERSTAND THAT SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOL IS USING SOME OF THIS TAP MONEY OR SAFE ROUTES SCHOOL IS A TAP GRANT SUBCATEGORY BUT NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND. SO, LIKE, THIS MAY AFFECT OUR SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOL APPLICATION BUT NOT OUR TAP GRANTS APPLICATION OR ALL OF IT. I KNOW IT'S A DIFFICULT QUESTION, BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT GETTING THE GREATEST ANSWERS FROM MDOT, BUT --
03:26:57.119: >> THAT'S WHERE THE COULD   COMS IN.
03:26:58.820: >> Councilmember Hayner: OKAY.
03:26:59.988: >> THEY SAID THAT IT COULD AFFECT OTHER GRANTS UNDER THE TAP UMBRELLA. BUT THEY WILL HAVE NOT BEEN SPECIFIC AS TO HOW THAT WOULD HAPPEN.
03:27:11.500: >> Councilmember Hayner:  AND IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND, WHAT TYPES OF THINGS ARE THOSE?
03:27:18.340: >> SO THE TRANSPORTATION OF ALTERNATIVES PROGRAM -- LET ME SEE IF I CAN REMEMBER. I'M NOT GOING TO REMEMBER ALL THE VARIOUS KOHL UPONNENTS UNDER IT, BUT -- COMPONENTS UNDER IT, BUT ESSENTIALLY THEY INCLUDE THINGS LIKE, YOU KNOW, OFF-ROAD PATHS AND THINGS LIKE THAT ALTERNATIVE TRANSPORTATION-TYPE THINGS WE USED TAP MONEY IN THE PAST FOR THE SIDE PATH ALONG WASHTENAW AVENUE, FOR EXAMPLE, AND I BELIEVE WE ARE USING TO SOME TAP GRANT MONEY FOR THE ON CREEK BERM OPENING PROJECT AND THAT GIVES YOU A FLAVOR OF THAT TYPE OF THING.
03:27:58.013: >> Councilmember Hayner:  SO THEY ARE REASONABLE IN USE BY THE CITY?
03:27:59.981: >> THEY ARE. WHEN WE HAVE A PROJECT THAT WOULD BE A GOOD PROJECT TO APPLY FOR THAT TYPE OF GRANT, THAT WOULD FIT THAT KIND OF FUNDING CATEGORY, WE SEEK OUT THOSE GRANTS.
03:28:09.724: >> Councilmember Hayner: OKAY. THIS TRANSPORTATION SAFETY COMMITTEE, THAT THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR REFERRED TO, IS THIS SOMEBODY ON COUNCIL WHO
03:28:18.867: >> City Admin. Lazarus: MR. EAT MR. EATON IS THE --
03:28:25.240: >> Councilmember Griswold: I'M THE CURRENT.
03:28:26.641: >> City Admin. Lazarus: MS. GRI SWOLD IS THE REPRESENTATIVE. BUT EATON AND GRISWOLD HAVE --
03:28:37.319: >> Councilmember Hayner: OKAY. AND IT'S A REGULAR -- YOU REFER TO IT AS BEING A REGULAR MEETING. HANE>> Councilmember Hayner: IT'S KIND OF MONTHLY.
03:28:47.628: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WANT TO CATCH THE NEXT MEETING.
03:28:53.768: >> City Admin. Lazarus: 2:00 ON TUESDAYS --
03:28:55.770: >> I DON'T KNOW WHEN THE N. ONE IS.
03:28:57.538: >> Councilmember Hayner: IT'S ON THE LEGISTAR.
03:29:03.178: >> NO, THE SCHOOL DISTRICT ORGANIZES THOSE MEETING.
03:29:08.583: >> City Admin. Lazarus: I APOLOGIZE TOM TO MS. GRISWOLD TT SHE WAS THE APPOINTED REPRESENT.
03:29:17.625: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER GRAND?
03:29:19.928: >> Councilmember Grand: I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS THIS EVENING. I THINK IT'S CRITICAL THAT WHILE NOT A PERFECT PROCESS, I HAVE RECEIVED A LOT OF ADMIRATION FOR THEIR WORK AND DESERVEDLY SO FOR TRYING TO BE RESPONSIVE AND MAKE UP FOR SOME OF THOSE MISSTEPS AND TO BE RESPONSIVE TO RESIDENTS' NEEDS AND GO THROUGH MANY ITERATIONS OF THIS PROJECT. AS I RED A COMMENT OUT IN THE TWITTER-VERSE RIGHT NOW, ABOUT SIDEWALKS AND HOW YOU -- IT'S DIFFICULT TO ASSESS HOW WELL THEY'LL BE USED WHEN THERE WEREN'T IN SIDEWALKS THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE. SO IF THERE ARE NO SIDEWALKS, YOU ARE LESS LIKELY TO USE THAT ROAD AND I THINK THAT'S A REALLY GOOD POINT, WHEN WE ARE LOOKING AT A ROAD THAT LEADS DIRECTLY TO THE SCHOOL AND THERE'S A REASON FOR PUTTING THIS THERE. -- PUTTING IT THIS. YOU KNOW, I THINK WE NEED TO -- EVEN WHEN IT'S AN IMPROPER PROCESS, THIS HAS BEEN A CONCERN OF A2 STEAM PARENTS SINCE IT'S BECOME A2 STEAM AND THERE'S BEEN AN INFLUX OF PARENTS AND THE NUMBER OF FAMILIES IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD IS ONLY GOING TO INCREASE AS THE, YOU KNOW, REPUTATION OF THE SCHOOL CONTINUES TO BECOME ONE THAT'S INCREDIBLY DESIRE. I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS OF NEIGHBORS AND I UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS IS IMPROPER BUT I DON'T THINK THAT SHOULD BE THE ENEMY OF THE GOOD, WHICH IN THIS CASE IS THE SAFETY OF OUR KIDS.
03:30:52.454: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? SORRY THANK YOU. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
03:30:56.458: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I HAVE A QUESTION, A POINT OF ORDER QUESTION. UNRELATED TO THIS TOPIC, BUT TO THE DISCUSSION. MAYBE SOMEONE HON THE RULES COMMITTEE CAN HELP ME OUT WITH THIS. I THOUGHT WE WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO BE ON SOCIAL MEDIA DURING MEETINGS.
03:31:21.682: >> Councilmember Grand: WE CAN'T TWEET.
03:31:24.252: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YOU ARE OKAY READING IT AND YOU THINK IT'S NOT CROSSING THE LINE.
03:31:32.227: >> Councilmember Grand: OUR COUNCIL RULES SAY THAT WE CAN'T TWEET.
03:31:38.966: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I BELIEVE WE ARE DELIBERATE AND THAT HAS COME ON STRONG IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS OR. SO WE HAVE MORE DELIBBORRATION AT THE TABLE THAN WE EVER HAD BEFORE. IN THE OUTSIDE WORLD IS COMING IN THROUGH PEOPLE BROWSING SOCIAL MEDIA, THAT'S FINE. I JUST -- I THINK IT'S -- I JUST WANTED TO POINT IT OUT AS ODD. I THINK IT'S STRANGE.
03:31:58.853: >> Councilmember Grand: OKAY. I WOULDN'T UNDERESTIMATE MY ABILITY TO MULTITASK.
03:32:02.090: >> Councilmember Hayner: WELL, I DON'T. I DON'T. AND AT THE RISK -- I QUESTION -- HE QUESTIONED YOU AND I'M SURE THERE ARE OTHERS AT THE TABLE AND I'M SURE TWITTER IS OUT THERE CALLING ME A MISOGYNIST. I HAVE SEE IT ALL THE TIME IN MANY OTHER WAYS. WE SEE NOTE PASSING BETWEEN ADMINISTRATION AND COUNCIL MEMBERS. WE SEE ALL KINDS OF STUFF HERE BEHIND THE -- BEHIND THE DAIS, AND, YOU KNOW, I JUST WANT US TO STAY FOCUSED. I WANT TO EXPRESS MY CONCERNS THAT, YOU KNOW, IT IS FINE. MULTITASK ALL YOU WANT BUT I REFER THIS OVER TO RULES. I HAVE THIS I WE SHOULD TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
03:32:41.362: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
03:32:57.479: >> Councilmember Eaton: NO.

03:33:23.871: >> Mayor Taylor: DS2, RESOLUTION TO APPROVE A CONTRACT WITH THE MICHIGAN DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION FOR THE NORTH SIDE STEAM SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOL SIDEWALK GAP PROJECT, $415,874. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
03:33:36.717: >> Councilmember Hayner:  IS THIS NOW MOOT?
03:33:39.621: >> Mayor Taylor: IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE OPTIMAL RESOLUTION OF THIS FROM OUR ADVISOR'S PERSPECTIVE IS TO TABLE IT RATHER THAN VOTING IT DOWN.
03:33:46.394: >> Councilmember Hayner: OKAY.
03:33:47.695: >> Mayor Taylor: IF THAT'S ACCEPTABLE TO THE BODY.
03:33:50.131: >> Councilmember Hayner: COULD I ASK FOR AN EXPLANATION OF THAT?
03:33:56.171: >> I THINK OUR VIEW IS THE OPTIMAL SOLUTION IS TO VOTE IT DOWN.
03:33:59.607: >> Mayor Taylor: PARDON ME?
03:34:00.408: >> TO VOTE IT DOWN.
03:34:02.009: >> Mayor Taylor: THAT'S THE --
03:34:02.810: >> REALLY?
03:34:05.246: >> Mayor Taylor: FORGET I SAID ANYTHING.
03:34:06.347: >> PERHAPS MR. HUPY COULD EXPLAIN THAT.
03:34:10.385: >> Mayor Taylor: SURE.
03:34:10.885: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATIONS.
03:34:14.389: >> THE ORIGINAL THOUGHT WAS THAT IF THERE WAS A CHANCE OF THE RESOLUTION 4 COMING BACK BY TABLING IT, IT WOULD NOT KILL THE CITY STATE AGREEMENT, BUT IF THE RESOLUTION 4 IS NOT COMING BACK, IT -- WE VOTE DOWN THE MDOT CITY-STATE AGREEMENT AND IT ENDS THE PROJECT.
03:34:40.948: >> Mayor Taylor: FAIR ENOUGH. THANK YOU. FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
03:34:45.586: >> Councilmember Lumm: IS IT CONCEIVABLE IT COULD BE BROUGHT BACK WITH ONE SIDEWALK ON TRAVER AND TAKING BROOKSIDE OUT? I KNOW YOU HAVE GONE OVER --
03:34:52.760: >> NOT WITH A GRANT?
03:34:56.731: >> Councilmember Lumm: NO. OKAY.
03:34:57.699: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? ALL OPPOSED? [ CHOROUS OF NAYS ]
03:35:13.881: >> Mayor Taylor: THE RESOLUTION IS NOT APPROVED. IT'S BUDGET TIME. LET'S TAKE A SHORT BREAK. [ BREAK ] WE ARE BACK, DS-3, RESOLUTION TO ADOPT ANN ARBOR CITY BUDGET AND RELATED PROPERTY TAX MILLAGE RITES FOR FISCAL YEAR 2020, MOVED BY RAM  RAMLAWI AND SECONDED. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
03:43:52.866: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU. FIRST AMENDMENT, THE STREET AMENDMENT.
03:44:04.510: >> Mayor Taylor: SO AMENDMENT ONE. SECONDED BY?
03:44:10.449: >> Councilmember Lumm: EATON.
03:44:11.084: >> Mayor Taylor: MY APOLOGIES. THANK YOU.
03:44:12.185: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER EATON FOR COULD COSPONSORING THIS AMENDMENT THIS IS SIMILAR TO THE ONE LAST YEAR WHEN I DISCOVERED THE BUDGET PROPOSED LAST YEAR DIDN'T UTILIZE ALL THE FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR FIXING THE ROADS. WE HAD THE SAME SITUATION THIS YEAR. IT'S ONE THING NOT HAVING ENOUGH MONEY TO FIX THE ROADS BUT NOT PUTTING TO WORK ALL THE MONEY THAT WE TO HAVE. IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE IT'S AND NOT CONSISTENT WITH THE EXPECTATIONS OF OUR RESIDENTS. JUST FIX THE ROADS IS A REFRAIN WE HEAR OVER AND OVER FROM FOLKS. WE CONDUCTED TWO RESIDENT SURVEYS OVER THE LAST YEAR RELATED TO SPENDING PRIORITIES AND IN BOTH, ROAD RESURFACING AND REPAIR RATED AT THE TOP IN TERMS OF RESIDENT PRIORITIES. IN FACT, IN THE BUDGET PRIORITY SURVEY CONDUCTED LAST FALL, WE ASKED RESIDENTS IN THE CITY SHOULD SPEND MORE, LESS, OR THE SAME IN 57 BUDGET CATEGORIES AND OF THE CATEGORIES RESIDENTS INDICATED THE CITY SHOULD SPEND MORE THE, QUOTE, FIXING THE ROADS, END QUOTE CATEGORIES RETAININGED NUMBER ONE, AND I DO GIVE STAFF CREDIT FOR OWNING THE CHALLENGE AND PROVIDING TARGETS FOR THE COUNCIL ADOPTED AND GEOFFING US REAL DATA WITH WHICH WE ARE TARGETING OF 40 WE ARE DO. OUR TARGET IS TO HAVE ANN ARBOR VEITS AT  80 P 80PASER RATINGS. OUR RATINGS IN 2017 FOR OUR NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS CALLED LOCAL STREETS, DETERIORATED FROM WHERE THEY WERE IN 2014. FOR THOSE LOCAL STREETS, LESS THAN A THIRD, 29% TO BE PRECISE WERE RATED SEVEN OR BETTER AND FOR MAJOR STREETS ABOUT HALF MET THE TARGET IN THE 2 2017 RATINGS. THE AMENDMENT DOES TWO THINGS FIRST IT REAFFIRMS THE TARGET OF HAVING 80% OF THE STREET AT 7 RATING OR BETTER BY 2025. SECOND, IT INCREASES BUDGETED SPENDING IN FISCAL YEAR 20 ON RESURFACING, REPAIR, OR PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE BY $3. THE AMENDMENT IS NOT PRESCRIPTIVE ON HOW TO SPEND THE $3 MILLION. IT JUST ENSURES THAT ALL THE FUNDING AVAILABLE TO SPEND IS ACTUALLY INCLUDED IN THE EXPENDITURE BUDGET. WHERE DOES THE $3 MILLION COME FROM? THE ANSWER IS THAT OUR CURRENT RESERVE POLICY FOR THE MAJOR AND LOCAL STREET IS TO MAINTAIN A MINIMUM FUND BALANCE EQUAL TO 12 MONTHS OF REVENUE. STAFF INDICATED ON APRIL APRIL 26th, THAT THE FORECAST FOR FISCAL YEAR '20 IS QUOTA PROXIMATELY $3 MILLION AND THAT'S $1 MILLION IN MAJOR STREETS AND $2 MILLION IN LOCAL STREETS IN EXCESS OF FUND BALANCE POLICY REQUIREMENTS END QUOTE THIS AMENDMENT UTILIZES THOSE AVAILABLE FUNDS. ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN THE MAJOR STREET FUND AND $2 MILLION IN THE LOCAL STREET FUND. AND MAINTAINS THE FUND BALANCES AT THE PRESCRIBED POLICY LEVELS OF 12 MONTHS OF REVENUE. I BELIEVE THE AMENDMENT UTILIZING THE AVAILABLE EXCESS FUNDS IS REASONABLE. FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE AND CONSISTENT WITH COMMUNITY EXPECTATIONS. I HOPE YOU WILL AGREE AND WE'LL SUPPORT THIS AMENDMENT TONIGHT AND THANK YOU FOR CONSIDERING IT.
03:47:27.280: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
03:47:28.181: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBERS AND LUMM AND EATON FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD. I SUPPORTED IT LAST YEAR AND I THINK IT'S A GOOD PRACTICE ON WHOLE. I WILL ADD THIS IS THE FOURTH BUDGET THAT COUNCILMEMBER LUMM AND I WORKED ON TOGETHER AND IT'S WE'RE ALWAYS FINDING NEW WAYS TO GET IN TROUBLE. SO I WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED TO SPONSORING THIS AMENDMENT.
03:47:52.738: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
03:47:55.608: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I WOULD LIKE TO ECHO COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN'S REMARKS IN THANKING COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, AND EATON FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND IT'S -- IT'S OBVIOUS TO EVERYONE WE COULD BE SPENDING MORE ON OUR STREETS AND IF WE HAVE MONEY NO SPEND, I WOULD LIKE SOMEONE TO GIVE ME A GOOD REASON WHY WE SHOULDN'T. WE SHOULD BE PUTTING EVERY DOLLAR WE HAVE TOWARDS OUR STREETS AND ROADS. THEY ARE IN DEPLORABLE CONDITION, UNSAFE, UNSAFE FOR WALKERS, UNSAFE FOR BIKERS. TANG RUSS FOR COMMUTERS AND I APPRECIATE EVERYTHING THAT STAFF IS DOING. I'M NOT HERE TO SAY THAT WE HAVEN'T DONE A GREAT JOB, BUT THE STATE WENT THROUGH A LONG RECESSION. AND A LOT OF CUTS AND WE DIDN'T GET TO FIXING AND MAINTAINING OUR ROADS TO THE LEVEL THAT WE SHOULD, AND I APPRECIATE THE SKILL THAT COUNCILMEMBER LUMM HAS IN FINDING THIS ADDITIONAL MONEY, AND PUTTING IT TO USE, AND LIKE COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN, I WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A SPONSOR.
03:49:07.112: >> Mayor Taylor: GRAND, BANNISTER. PERHAPS FOR AMENDMENTS OF ACCLAMATION, MAKE THIS QUICK.
03:49:13.485: >> Councilmember Grand: I WILL DISAGREE WITH COUNCILMEMBER LUMM MANY TIMES TONIGHT, NOT THIS TIME, AND WOULD ALSO LIKE TODAY ADDED AS A COSPONSOR. THANK YOU.
03:49:19.692: >> Councilmember Lumm: WOW!
03:49:21.827: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
03:49:22.761: >> Councilmember Griswold: ADD ME AS A COSPONSOR.
03:49:23.929: >> Councilmember Bannister: I WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A COSPONSOR ALSO AN I HAD A SPOT OF GOOD NEWS. ONE OF THE RESIDENTS WHO CAME TO CAUCUS LAST NIGHT, WHO WORKS AT THE EPA, HE POINTED OUT ABOUT SHIPS CAN'T USE HEAVY FUEL ANYMORE AND THAT THE PRICE OFs FAULT IS GOING TO DROP PRPRECIPITOUSLY AT THE END OF THIS YEAR. SO SINCE THIS IS FOR THE FUTURE BUDGET, HOPEFULLY, WE WILL BENEFIT FROM PAY MUCH LOWER PRICE ON ASPHALT ALSO. THANK YOU.
03:49:54.827: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
03:49:56.895: >> Councilmember Hayner:  IS IT YOUR UNDERSTANDING, COUNCILWOMAN LUMM, THAT AS WITH ALL BUDGET AMENDMENTS AND ADOPTING THIS BUDGET, THAT IT WILL ALSO BE -- WE WILL BE CONSIDERING THIS AS PART OF THE
03:50:09.742: >> Councilmember Lumm: ABSOLUTE LY.
03:50:14.179: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I DON'T WANT TO PILE ON, BUT WHO CAN'T GET BEHIND ROADS? BUT I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO COSPONSOR THIS.
03:50:24.589: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. IN ALL IN FAVOR,. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? AMENDMENT NUMBER ONE IS APPROVED. FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN MOTION AS AMENDED? COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
03:50:39.404: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU. SO AMENDMENT TWO. THIS IS THE RESOLUTION -- [ OFF MICROPHONE COMMENTS ]
03:50:58.891: >> Mayor Taylor: SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
03:51:01.694: >> Councilmember Lumm: EVER SINCE THE LARGE DEVELOPMENTS ONYXON ROADS, NIXON FARMS AND 2016, I HAVE BEEN PUSHING TO MOVE EXPEDITIOUSLY ON THE TRAFFIC FLOW IMPROVEMENTS ON THE NIXON ROAD IMPROVEMENTS. THIS AMENDMENT IS ANOTHER STEP IN THAT PROCESS. THE NEED FOR TRAFFIC FLOW IMPROVEMENTS ON THE CORRIDOR IS CRYSTAL CLEAR. THE TRAFFIC CONGESTION WAS AN ISSUE BEFORE ADDING 750 NEW RESIDENTIAL UNITS AND EVEN THE NIXON FARMS TRAFFIC STUDY CONCLUDED THE FUTURE TURNING MOVEMENTS AT THE KEY NIXON INTERSECTIONS WOULD OPERATE AT UNACCEPTABLE LEVELS OF SERVICE, LEVELS OF E AND F. IT CAN'T GET WORSE THAN THAT. A CORRIDOR TRAFFIC IMPROVEMENT WAS COMPLETED IN 2017 AND THE DESIGN FOR THE IMPROVEMENT WAS COMPLETED LAST YEAR AND IT'S TELL IN PROCESS. IT WOULD BE A A MAJOR PROJECT. THERE WERE WILL BE SEVERAL PUBLIC MEETINGS AND WORKSHOPS. THE ORIGINAL DESIGN OF FIVE ROUNDABOUTS IS EVOLVING AND IT'S EXPECTED A FINAL DESIGN RECOMMENDATION WILL COME LATER THIS SUMMER. THE CURRENT CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS PLAN, C.I.P. HAS CONSTRUCTION IN THREE PHASES WITH PHASE ONE, PLYMOUTH TO BLOUT AND PHASE TWO IN 2026 OR LATER. DURING THE COUNCIL DISCUSSIONS ONYXON FARMS AND WOODBURY CLUB, SEVERAL COUNCILMEMBERS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT SOMETHING WOULD NEED TO BE DONE. THE MAYOR SAID THE TRAFFIC CONGESTION ISSUES WILL NEED TO BE FIXED, END QUOTE AND QUOTE THE NEW TAX REVENUES FROM THE DEVELOPMENT WILL HELP TO PAY FOR THOSE FIXES END QUOTE. THOSE COMMITMENTS WERE MADE IN 2015. NIXON FARMS IS WELL UNDER CONSTRUCTION AND I BELIEVE WE NEED TO BEGIN TO HONOR THE COMMITMENT EARLIER THAN FIVE TO SIX YEARS FROM NOW. SPECIFICALLY, THE AMENDMENT DOES A COUPLE OF THINGS. IT WOULD ACCELERATE PHASE ONE CONSTRUCTION AND INCLUDE THE CURRENT ESTIMATE OF $2 MILLION AS A CAPITAL EXPENSE PLACE HOLDER, IN THE FISCAL YEAR '21 FINANCIAL PLAN. THE AMENDMENT DIRECTS THE ADMINISTRATOR TO RETURN TO COUNCIL BY FEBRUARY 2020 AFTER THE DESIGN PROCESS IS COMPLETE. WITH THE REPORT DETAILING THE DESIGN RECOMMENDATION, UPDATED COST ESTIMATES AND RECOMMENDED FUNDING SOURCES. THE AMENDMENT ALSO REQUESTS THAT CITY STAFF AND THE PLANNING COMMISSION CONSIDER ACCELERATING PHASE TWO, TO DUVARN AND DUVANR FOR THE NIXON CORRIDOR IMPROVEMENT PROJECT DURING THEIR REVIEW AND ADOPTION OF THE FISCAL YEAR '21 TO '26 CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS PLAN. THE PLANNING COMMISSION APPROVES THE C. I.P. CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS PLAN AND THAT'S WHY AS A REQUEST RATHER THAN A DIRECTIVE. I KNOW MY PUSHING ON THIS MAY FEEL LIKE A BROKEN RECORD NOW. I'M SORRY FOR, THAT BUT IT IS NOT OFTEN, MAYBE NEVER THAT THE CITY HAS APPROVED RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS OF THIS SIZE, A SMALL CITY ON ITS OWN, IN AN AREA THAT'S PLAGUED BY SEVERE TRAFFIC CONDITIONS. I BELIEVE STRONGLY IT'S COUNCIL'S RESPONSIBILITY TO HONOR THE COMMITMENT WE MADE TO THESE RESIDENTS AS EXPEDITIOUSLY AS POSSIBLE. I HOPE YOU AGREE AND THANKS FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.
03:54:12.317: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN. ZACK >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER LUMM FOR YOUR WORK ON THAT. I STATED SUPPORT FOR A SIMILAR MEASURE LAST YEAR ON THE BASIS THAT AS WE DO BRING IN THE DEVELOPMENT, WE NEED TO BE FLEXIBLE IN HOW WE PLAN OUR INFRASTRUCTURE, AND OUR TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE IN PARTICULAR TO RESPOND TO IT. I DO HAVE A QUESTION TO STAFF AND A SIMILAR QUESTION ON -- [ OFF MICROPHONE COMMENT ] I SEE THE TREMENDOUS NEED FOR BOTH, BUT I JUST WANT TO UNDERSTAND ANY TRADEOFFS INVOLVED AND I DON'T KNOW WHO -- IS THAT MR. HUTCHINSON? AND MR. HUPY, DOUBLE OF COURSE. [ OFF MICROPHONE COMMENT ] DO YOU HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT OTHER MAJOR INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS WILL BE AFFECTED?
03:55:22.053: >> WE HAVE HAD SOME DISCUSSION ON THAT, AND WE CAN'T NAME SPECIFIC PROJECTS YET AT THIS POINT BECAUSE YOU ARE DIRECTING US TO GO BACK AND LOOK AT FUNDING SOURCES. BUT IT'S LIKELY WE'LL AFFECT OUR RESURFACING PROGRAMS BOTH LOCALLY AND MAJOR, NOT KNOWING HOW MUCH IT WILL BE, BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE MOST OF OUR FLEXIBILITY IS IN OUR FUNDING OF PROJECTS AND THAT BEING SAID, I WILL LET MANY HUX INNSON COMMENT FURTHER IF HE HAS ANY FURTHER COMMENTS.
03:55:56.721: >> Councilmember Ackerman: AND IF I COULD ASK A FOLLOW-ON. AS WE TALK ABOUT OUR MAJOR STREET RESURFACING OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT, YOU KNOW, FEW FISCAL YEARS ALL THE WAY UP TO 2025, I GUESS WHAT -- WHAT -- ANY HIGHLIGHTS OR REGIONS OF THE CITY THAT WOULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED. AND I ALSO REALIZE THAT THIS IS JUST A REQUEST. SO THESE CONVERSATIONS COULD MOVE FORWARD AS WELL.
03:56:24.782: >> AND OUR STREET RESURFACING IS PROBABLY THE LEAST PRESCRIPTIVE GOING FORWARD INTO THE FUTURE. HENCE, THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY THERE.
03:56:34.726: >> Councilmember Ackerman: UNDERSTOOD. OKAY.
03:56:42.366: >> YES, AS CRAIG PRETTY MUCH INDICATED ALREADY, WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHICH PROJECTS WOULD HAVE TO BE DELAYED, BUT OVER THE COURSE, WE WOULD MOVE THIS UP INTO FY '21 OVER COURSE OF FIA '22 AND 23, WE WOULD HAVE TO BUILD THE FUND BALANCE UP TO THE SIZE. AND OVER THE TWO YEARS WE WOULD HAVE TO DELAY SOME OF THE PROJECTS IN ORDER TO DO THAT. AND I CAN'T SAY RIGHT AT THE MOMENT WHAT ALL OF THOSE TREATS WOULD BE.
03:57:11.128: >> Councilmember Ackerman: AS THE DIRECTOR HERE, IS THERE A REQUEST THAT CITY STAFF AND FUNDING CONSIDER THE ACCELERATION? I PRESUME THAT ANY RECOMMENDATIONS BACK FROM STAFF ON HOW TO AMEND THE C. I.P. WOULD CONTAIN THAT INFORMATION? BUT WOULD WE GET MORE DETAIL AS TO WHAT THE SPECIFIC EFFECTS WOULD BE?
03:57:29.581: >> AS WE LOOK AT THE FUNDING ALTERNATIVE. AND I'M ALSO REMINDED THAT THIS CORRIDOR WILL GREATLY IMPACT THE WATER FUND AND THE STORMWATER FUND. AND THE WATER FUND IS MOST CHALLENGED RIGHT NOW FOR ALL THE CAPITAL TO PLANT AND SO WE HAVE TO LOOK HOW WE WOULD FUND THE WATER INFRASTRUCTURE THAT NEEDS TO BE REPLACED UNDER THIS ROAD AS IT'S REBUILT. AND UNDER THE GREEN STREETS POLICY, WE HAVE TO UNDERTAKE MAJOR STORMWATER UPGRADES.
03:58:03.180: >> Councilmember Ackerman: OKAY.
03:58:05.182: >> SO IT'S JUST NOT THE ROAD FUNDING, IT'S -- IT'S SOME OF THE ENTERPRISE FUNDING, ACTUALLY THE WATER IS PROBABLY THE TIGHTEST OF THE FUNDS TO BE IMPACTED. ZACK >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU.
03:58:22.033: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I THINK IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS PROJECT AND IF THERE ARE ANY CONSTRAINTS AT ALL, PLEASE BRING THEM TO COUNCIL AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE, AND I WILL ADVOCATE FOR THE APPROPRIATE ACTIONS SO THAT YOU CAN MAKE THIS A REALITY. SO I WANT TO MENTION TWO OTHER THINGS, CONGESTION, LEADS TO INCREASED AIR POLLUTION. IF WE ARE SPENDING HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS ON CLIMATE ACTION, IT SEEMS WE ALSO NEED TO CONSIDER OUR CONGESTION AND HOW THAT'S NEGATIVELY IMPACTING CLIMATE ACTION. THAT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO. ANOTHER ADVANTAGE OF MOVING THIS FORWARD IS THERE ARE THREE PROJECTS BEING CONSIDERED RIGHT NOW THAT WILL REDUCE LANES ON THREE, NORTH-SOUTH ROADS THAT RUN PARALLEL TO NIXON ROAD, AND I ASKED STAFF TO DELAY ANY ROAD REDUCTIONS ON ROADS THAT COULD BE USED TO DETOUR TRAFFIC WHILE WE'RE WOR WORKING ON NIXON ROAD. I KNOW THERE WERE MANY, MANY COMMENTS FROM CITIZENS AND I'M STILL WAITING FOR STAFF TO MAKE THOSE COMMENTS PUBLIC. THANK YOU.
03:59:46.050: >> Mayor Taylor: COMMISSIONER HAYNER.
03:59:46.918: >> Councilmember Hayner:  IF I LOOK AT THIS, THE TOTAL COAST COSTIS ESTIMATED TO BE $7.5 MILN AND DOES THAT INCLUDE THE -- THAT IS PROJECTED TO INCLUDE THE GREEN STREETS ARCHITECTURE AND THE STORMWATER IMPROVEMENTS THAT ARE NECESSARY OR THAT'S JUST THE STREET WORK, THE ROUNDABOUTS AND WHATEVER COMES ABOUT AS A RESULT OF THIS PLANNING? I'M SORRY THAT YOU HAD TO -- I'M SORRY THAT YOU HAD TO SIT DOWN. WHILE THEY ARE DIGGING THAT UP, YES, $7.5 MILLION IS A NICE CHUNK OF CHANGE AND I'M HARD PRESSED TO UNDERSTAND HOW JUST WHAT PERCENTAGE OF NEW TAX REVENUES ARE GOING TO -- ARING TO KICK IN FOR THIS -- ARE GOING TO KICK IN FOR THIS AND IT ILLUSTRATES A PROBLEM WHEN WE APPROACH GROWTH IN THE CITY THAT'S REFLECTED IN MANY AREAS AND THAT IS THAT THERE'S NO WAY THAT NEW TAX REVENUE FROM THESE DEVELOPMENTS IS GOING TO PAY FOR THESE CHANGES. I MEAN, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT $8 MILLION WORTH OF CHANGES. THAT'S A LOT OF TAX REVENUE! AND I KNOW IT'S PRED SPREAD OVEE COST OF THE SURFACES THAT'S CREATED AND THAT COULD BE 10, 25 YEARS BUT, MAN, THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY AND THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY THAT MAKES -- IT'S NOT THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO SPEND IT AT SOME POINT, IT'S NO THE THAT IT'S NOT NECESSARY TO MOVE THESE PEOPLE THROUGH, BUT WHAT I THINK IT DOES DO, IS IT -- IT POINTS OUT THE IDEA THAT I'M SKEPTICAL AND I REMAIN SKEPTICAL THAT GROWTH IS PAYING FOR ITSELF. I JUST DON'T BELIEVE IT IS. IT CAN'T BE OTHERWISE. SO IS THAT -- IS THAT RIGHT, THE 7.5 IS JUST FOR THE STREET WORK?
04:01:23.180: >> IT'S JUST THE ROADS. IT DOESN'T INCLUDE THE WATERS AND THE STORM.
04:01:30.086: >> Councilmember Hayner: YIKES! AND ARE THERE ASSESSMENTS TO THE WATER OR ANYTHING? THAT'S ALREADY BEEN SERVED TO NIXON FARMS AND SO ON AND THEY ARE MOVING IN.
04:01:38.128: >> IN ABSOLUTE DETAIL, I CAN'T ANSWER IT DEFINNIVELY, BUT I BELIEVE THERE -- DEFINITIVELY, BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THERE WOULD BE ASSESSMENTS BECAUSE WE HAVE WATER ALREADY IN NIXON. I DON'T KNOW IF THIS' ANY PIECE OF NIXON THAT DOESN'T HAVE STORM SERVICE.
04:01:50.908: >> Councilmember Hayner: IT'S EXTRA ESSENTIAL IN THAT AREA. AS WE KNOW, THERE'S A LOT OF WETLAND MANEUVERING AROUND THESE R PROJECTS AND THOSE ARE BIG STORMWATER ISSUES IN THAT PART OF TOWN.
04:02:04.755: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
04:02:06.022: >> Councilmember Lumm: THIS RELATES TO FISCAL YEAR '21 AND NOT THE FISCAL YEAR '20 BUDGET AND FOR THAT REASON, SPECIFIC FUNDING OFFSET HAS NOT BEEN IDENTIFIED, BUT RATHER IT DIRECTS THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR AND STAFF TO REPAIR THE -- PREPARE A REPORT TO COUNCIL BY FEBRUARY 29th, 2020, THAT WOULD INCLUDE -- AND I CONFIRMED THE DATES WITH THAT, THAT IT'S DOABLE AND IT WILL INCLUDE THE FINAL DESIGN AND UPDATED COST ESTIMATES BECAUSE WE JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT THOSE COSTS ARE. AND A RECOMMENDATION ON THE SPECIFIC FUNDING SOURCE. SO, YOU KNOW, IN OTHER WORDS IN, THE INTENT IS TO ESTABLISH THAT COUNCIL'S EXPEGGATION IS THAT PHASE ONE WILL BE DONE IN FISCAL YEAR '21 AND THAT'S HURON TO BLUAT, AND SINCE WE ARE APPROVING THE FISCAL YEAR '21 FINANCIAL PLAN AT THIS TIME, THAT INCLUDES CAPITAL PROJECTS, PHASE ONE SHOULD BE INCLUDED ON THAT LIST. SO --
04:03:14.758: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
04:03:15.959: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER -- I'M SORRY. YEAH. MAYOR TAYLOR AND STAFF. JUST A LOT OF BIG NUMBERS, OBVIOUSLY, AND JUST TO HELP US AND THE VIEWERS. WHAT PERCENTAGE DOES THE $2 MILLION COMPRISE OF THE OUTLAY FOR FISCAL YEAR '21, IF, AGAIN, KIND OF REFERRING BACK TO COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN'S GOOD POINT IS WHAT -- WHAT KIND OF EFFECT IS IT GOING TO HAVE? ARE WE TALKING ABOUT 50% OR 10%? AND THEN WHILE YOU ARE LOOING FOR THAT, WHAT IS THE -- LOOKING FOR THAT, WHAT IS THE PROJECTED ESTIMATE AND I KNOW PEOPLE DON'T LIKE TO PUT OUT NUMBERS THAT THEY WILL BE HELD TO, BUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE WATER SYSTEM UNDERNEATH THESE PHASES? IS IT EQUAL TO THE NUMBERS THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT HERE, $7.5 MILLION, OR ARE WE LOOKING AT FIVE TIMES THIS COST? I MEAN, WHAT KIND OF PROPORTION SHOULD WE BE LOOKING AT IN TERMS OF THE COST UNDER THE GROUND FOR THESE WATER, INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS?
04:04:27.898: >> ON THE STORM, I'M NOT EVEN GOING TO HAZARD A GUESS BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T DONE ANY DESIGN WORK YET ON THE STORM AND KNOW WHAT OPPORTUNITIES ARE AVAILABLE TO US IN THE CORRIDOR FOR STORMWATER MANAGEMENT. AND WATER, WE DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION RIGHT WITH US TONIGHT, BUT WE CAN GET BACK WITH YOU, BUT IT IS A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR THE WATER FUND AND BECAUSE IT'S ALREADY CHALLENGED. AND IT'S 18% OF OUR ANNUAL STREET MILLAGE.
04:05:04.367: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: WELL, THANK YOU. BUT WE DON'T KNOW IF IT'S $5 MILLION A MILE, $2 MILLION I MEAN, IT'S ALL --
04:05:11.975: >> FOR THE WATER?
04:05:14.611: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES.
04:05:15.579: >> IT WILL BE -- IT WILL PROBABLY BE LESS THAN THE ROAD CONSTRUCTION.
04:05:23.587: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  IT WOULD BE LESS.
04:05:24.688: >> BUT I'M HESITANT TO SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THE STORM.
04:05:27.057: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: AND THOSE WOULD BE DONE ALL AT THE SAME TIME?
04:05:32.829: >> THEY HAVE TO BE DONE ALL AT THE SAME TIME.
04:05:34.665: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU.
04:05:37.801: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? I HAD A QUESTION AS WELL. YOU INDICATED THAT THESE MIGHT COME OUT OF ESSENTIALLY RESURFACES?
04:05:52.282: >> AND I'M GOING TO TURN TO MARTY AND NICK ON THAT. AND THEY ARE NODDING THEIR HEAD YES.
04:06:03.493: >> Mayor Taylor: WITH RESPECT TO THE PHASE ONE, THE ESTIMATE AS TO WHAT THAT $2 MILLION, FOR RESUR SURFACING.
04:06:17.674: >> IT DEPENDS HOW WE USE IT IN RESURFACING, WHETHER WE PUT MATERIAL BACK OR WHETHER WE USE IT AS RECONSTRUCTION, WE ARE DOING BASE WORK OR WHETHER WE ARE DOING IT AS CAPITAL MAINTENANCE WHICH SHH FAR CHEAPER. SO NOT KNOWING EXACTLY WHAT THE MIX THAT WE WOULD BE TAKING OUT, IT'S HARD -- IT'S HARD TO SAY.
04:06:39.395: >> Mayor Taylor: WOULD THE ACCELERATION OF THIS PROJECT PHASE ONE IN '21 AND I'M ASSUMING BY EXTENSION, IN PHASE TWO AND THREE, IN THE FOLLOW-ON YEARS ASSUMING THAT THE STARS AHALIGN WITH RESPECT TO THE OTHR ISSUES, WITH RESPECT TO THE OTHER FUNDS? WOULD THE ACCELERATION OF THIS PROJECT IMPEDE OUR PROGRESS TO 80% OF OUR ROADS BEING ABOVE --
04:07:07.357: >> YES. ACCORDING TO THE CITY ENGINEER, ABSOLUTELY.
04:07:13.930: >> Mayor Taylor: SO IF WE WERE ADOPT THIS AND ACTUALLY DO IT, WE WOULD NOT GET THAT 80% OF OUR ROADS BY 2025?
04:07:21.404: >> IT WOULD MAKE IT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL.
04:07:28.679: >> Mayor Taylor: I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT MEANS.
04:07:35.652: >> AS AN ENGINEER, I CAN'T TELL YOU. BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE WOULD BE DEFERRING YET. IT WOULD BE A FAIR ASSUMPTION THAT WE COULDN'T MEET THE GOAL.
04:07:46.830: >> Mayor Taylor: OKAY.
04:07:47.363: >> Councilmember Lumm: CAN WE FIRST GET THE INFORMATION?
04:07:49.399: >> Mayor Taylor: DOES THE -- DID THE OBTAINING THIS -- DOES THE PASSAGE OF THIS COMMIT US TO DO ANYTHING ON A GOING FORWARD BASIS?
04:07:59.342: >> City Admin. Lazarus: IT DOES REQUIRE THAT THERE BE A DESIGN COMPLETED BY THE END OF FEBRUARY.
04:08:04.681: >> Mayor Taylor: DOES THE DESIGN COMPLETION -- DID AN SCACCELERATED DESIGN KOHL POLICE STATION, ACHIEVE GOALS? -- COMPLETION ACHIEVE GOALS?
04:08:16.392: >> THE DESIGN IS ALREADY OCCURRING.
04:08:18.595: >> Mayor Taylor: SO THAT DELIVERABLE IS ON ITS WAY?
04:08:22.131: >> City Admin. Lazarus: SO THAT WILL GIVE YOU A BETTER -- IT WILL REDUCE THE VARIABILITY.
04:08:25.000: >> AT THAT POINT, WE CAN START MAKING ENGINEERING ESTIMATES.
04:08:30.005: >> Mayor Taylor: PASSAGE OF THIS AMENDMENT -- WHAT I HEAR YOUING IS THE PASSAGE OF THIS AMENDMENT AND THE INCLUSION OF THE MONEY IN THE PLAN --
04:08:39.014: >> Councilmember Lumm: I WILL CHANGE IT.
04:08:39.915: >> Mayor Taylor: AND THE INSTRUCTION TO COMMIT TO MAKING THE DESIGN TO -- TO COMPLETING THE DESIGN, THAT THAT WOULD NOT COMMIT US TO THE PR PROJECT AND THEREBY NOT COMMIT US TO TAKING ACTION, WHICH WOULD RENDER ACHIEVING THE 80% GOOD AND ABOVE BY 2025 EXTREMELY DIFFICULT?
04:08:59.902: >> Councilmember Grand: WE HAVE A PROMISE THAT I BELIEVE IS FRIENDLY, WILL LIKELY BE FRIENDLY TO THE BODY.
04:09:03.539: >> Councilmember Lumm: I THINK I HAVE A SOLUTION HERE.
04:09:05.975: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
04:09:07.076: >> Councilmember Lumm: NO FUNDING OFFSET FOR '2021 IS GIVING PEOPLE HEARTBURN. I WOULD REMIND US ALL -- BECAUSE I WAS HERE --
04:09:15.451: >> Mayor Taylor: I WANT TO DO IT TOO.
04:09:17.387: >> Councilmember Lumm: I KEEP QUOTING YOU ON THIS AS YOU KNOW. YOU WERE IN THE PAPER. AND WE -- WE MADE A COMMITMENT TO THESE FOLKS OUT THERE. AND BELIEVE STRONGLY WE NEED TO HONOR THE COMMITMENTS WHEN WE MAKE COMMENTS. I WILL DELETE FIRST RESOLVE CLAUSE AND REPLACE WITH -- HE HAVEN'T SENT IT TO NIP, HERE IT IS. I CAN TYPE IT. RESOLVE THAT THE CITY COUNCIL'S EXPECTATION THAT PHASE ONE OF THE NIXON CORRIDOR IMPROVEMENT PROJECT PLYMOUTH TO BLOUTT WILL BE INCLUDED IN THE FISCAL '21 CAPITAL BUDGET.
04:10:01.631: >> City Admin. Lazarus: WHAT DOES IT DO TO THE WATER FUNDING IS ANOTHER QUESTION THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO ANSWER FOR COUNCIL.
04:10:07.169: >> YES, AS THE DESIGN IS DONE, WE WOULD BE ABLE TO LOOK AT WHAT CAPITAL IS REQUIRED FOR THE DESIGN IN THE WATER FUND AND HOW THAT COMPLETES.
04:10:20.550: >> Councilmember Grand: CAN I SECOND THAT?
04:10:22.051: >> Mayor Taylor: BEFORE WE GET PACK TO THAT ANSWER LET'S SECOND THAT.
04:10:25.755: >> Councilmember Lumm: I WILL TYPE IT UP AND SEND IT TO YOU.
04:10:29.191: >> Mayor Taylor: THE REFERENCE OF IT BEING AN EXPECTATION OR -- CAN WE GO WITH REQUEST?
04:10:34.063: >> Councilmember Lumm: I SAID EXPECTATION. NO, EXPECTATION.
04:10:39.502: >> Councilmember Lumm: OKAY. YOU KNOW, WE ARE GETTING INTO LIKE WORDSMITHING AND WE MADE A COMMITMENT.
04:10:45.875: >> Mayor Taylor: ANYBODY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH "EXPECTATION?" I WILL CONSIDER THAT FRIENDLY.
04:10:52.849: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU.
04:10:56.285: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. HUPY.
04:10:56.886: >> THE STORMWATER RIGHT NOW WITHOUT THE DESIGN BEING DONE IS ESTIMATED AT ABOUT $1 MILLION AND THE WATER IS ESTIMATED AT SOMEWHAT LESS THAN A MILLION. $800,000 TO $1 MILLION. BUT THOSE WOULD BOTH REQUIRE OTHER PROJECTS TO MOVE TO MAKE ROOM FOR THOSE. SO WE WOULD BE DEFERRING OTHER WORK, CRITICAL WORK IN WATER, STORM I CAN'T SAY EXACTLY WHAT WE WOULD HAVE TO MOVE.
04:11:25.648: >> Mayor Taylor: WHAT STRIKES YOU WITH -- I HAVEN'T HEARD NOTHING. MAYBE WE DON'T NEED TO, BUT IT STRIKES ME THAT WITH THE -- WITH THE SOFTER RESOLUTION, MY EXPECTATION IS THAT WILL LIKELY GO FORWARD. IS ASSUMING IT GOES FORWARD, I THINK ONE POINT OF INFORMATION WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE IS THE INFLUEINFLUENCE THIS WOULD HAVET OTT ROAD SURFACE TARGET. FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR OF THE AMENDMENT AS AMENDED?
04:11:55.177: >> Councilmember Lumm: I'M SENDING IT TO YOU NOW.
04:11:57.279: >> Mayor Taylor: ALL IN FAVOR OF THE AMENDMENT AS AMENDED. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED?
04:12:05.087: >> Councilmember Hayner: OPPOSED?
04:12:06.889: >> Mayor Taylor: WOULD YOU LIKE -- WOULD YOU LIKE A ROLL CALL VOTE?
04:12:08.558: >> Councilmember Hayner:  NOT IF I'M THE ONLY ONE.
04:12:10.626: >> Mayor Taylor: THE AMENDMENT PASSES COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER IN IS IN OPPOSITION. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
04:12:20.770: >> Councilmember Lumm: I WILL FLIP THE ORDER OF FOUR AND THREE. I WOULD LIKE US TO DISCUSS AMENDMENT NUMBER FOUR, WHICH IS THE AMENDMENT TO RESTORE FALL LEAF AND HOLIDAY TREE PICKUP.
04:12:34.484: >> Mayor Taylor: SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER EATON. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
04:12:39.188: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU, MAYOR AND COUNCILMEMBER EATON FOR TRACKING THIS THE CITY DISCONTINUED FALL LEAF PICKUP FOR CITY RESIDENTS IN 2011. I CONTINUE TO AREA FROM RESIDENTS IN ANY WARD THAT LEAF PICKUP WAS ONE CITY SERVICE THEY REALLY VALUED AND APPRECIATED. AND THEY BELIEVE LEAF PICKIUM IS SOMETHING THAT THEIR TAX DOLLARS SHOULD PAY FOR. THE CITY SAYS WE DO PICK UP LEAVES WHEN THEY ARE IN BAGS OR COMPOST CARTS. WELL, FOR FOLKS WITH A LOT OF LEAVES LIKE MANY IN THE SECOND WARD, THEY ARE NOT VIABLE ALTERNATIVES. THEY HIRE PRIVATE CONTRACTORS AND THE CITY HAS SHIFTED THE COST TO RESIDENTS. THE HOLIDAY TREE PICKUP IS A NICE SERVICE TO PROVIDE AND COSTS VERY LITTLE. I TRIED TO PRESTORE LEAF AND HOLIDAY TREE PICKUP A COUPLE OF TIMES AND FAILED, SO I GAVE UP. I'M BRINGING IT BACK NOW FOR THREE REASONS. ONE, PRIMARILY BECAUSE THERE HAS BEEN TREMENDOUS GROWTH IN CITY REVENUES; AND TWO, SEVERAL CURRENT COUNCILMEMBERS HAVE NOT WEIGHED IN ON THE QUESTION; AND THREE, IT'S A SERVICE VALUED BY MANY RESIDENTS AND THAT HAS NOT CHANGES. THE COST TO RESTORE TWO LEAF PICKUPS IN THE FALL AND HOLIDAY TREE PICKUP IN JANUARY IS A ONE-TIME COST OF $470,000 FOR THE EQUIPMENT AND ONGOING ANNUAL COST OF $370,000 OF WHICH $340,000 IS FOR LEAVES AND $30,000 FOR HOLIDAY TREES. THE AMENDMENT PAYS FOR THE ONE-TIME COST OF $470,000 BY USING SOLID WASTE FUND RESERVES. THE CITY POLICY FOR THE MINIMUM FUND BALANCE AND SOLID WASTE LIKE ALL ENTERPRISE FUNDS IS TO MAINTAIN RESERVES EQUIVALENT TO 25% OF ANNUAL OPERATING EXPENSE. FOR SOLID WASTE, THAT AMOUNTS TO $4.3 MILLION. THE PROJECTED FISCAL YEAR '20 YEAR END FUND BALANCE IS $8.9 MILLION, OR $4.6 MILLION OVER THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENT AND USING $470,000 FOR THIS REPRESENTS USING JUST 10% OF THE EXCESS BALANCE. WHILE THE SOLID WASTE FUND RESERVES ARE MORE THAN ADEQUATE TO PAY THE ONE-TIME COST, THE PROJECTED ONGOING LOSS FOR SOLID WASTE DOES NOT EASILY SUPPORT THE ADDITIONAL $370,000 IN ONGOING ANNUAL COSTS FOR THE SERVICE. THE GENERAL FUND, HOWEVER, CAN PAY FOR THE $370,000 IN ANNUAL COSTS TO RESTORE THE SERVICE. FOR FISCAL YEAR '20, IN ADDITION TO THE NEW $2.2 MILLION IN COUNTY MILLAGE PROCEEDS THE PROPOSED BUDGET INCREASES GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURES BY $5 MILLION OVER FISCAL YEAR '19. INCLUDED IN THAT YEAR-TO-YEAR INCREASE IS OVER $1.7 MILLION IN NEW RECURRING EXPENDITURES, THAT ARE LARGELY INTERNALLY FOCUSED ON CITY GOVERNMENT OR ADMINISTRATION, RATHER THAN PROVIDING ENHANCED SERVICES TO RESIDENTS. THE YEAR-TO-YEAR INCREASES INCLUDE $500,000 IN SUPPLEMENTAL PENSION FUND CONTRIBUTIONS, $400,000 IN ANNUAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO A NEW CAPITAL SINKING FUND FOR CITY-OWNED ASSETS, $300,000 FOR FIRE STATION MASTER PLAN PROJECTS AND $150,000 FOR THE POLICE COMMISSION SUPPORT, AND $167,000 FOR TWO NEW  F DEs WHICH IS A CONTRACT ADMINISTRATOR AND H.R. BENEFITS ANALYST AND $117,000 INCREASE FOR TRAINING AN INCLUSIONARY CONTRACT, AND $100,000 INCREASE FOR OUTSIDE LEGAL COUNCIL. THE AMENDMENT REDUCES THESE INCREASES, AND NEW FUNDING THAT'S LARGELY INTERNALLY FOCUSED TO PAY FOR RESTORING A DIRECT SERVICE TO RESIDENTS. LET ME SAY THAT AGAIN. IT REDUCES INCREASES. IT DOES NOT TAKE AWAY OR REDUCE FUNDING FOR ANYTHING WE DO NOW. SPECIFICALLY, THE THREE $370,000 IN OPERATING COSTS IS FUNDED BY REDUCTIONS OF $370,000 IN GENERAL FUND EXPENSES AND CORRESPONDING EXPENSES OF $370,000 TO THE SOLID WASTE FUND. THE GENERAL FUND REDUCTIONS ARE IN FOUR AREAS. $200,000 BY REDUCING THE NEW CAPITAL SINKING FUND CONTRIBUTION FROM $400,000 TO $200,000. $99,000 BY ELIMINATING THE PROPOSED NEW FTEs FOR A CONTRACT ADMINISTRATOR. $46,000 BY REDUCING THE INCREASES IN TRAINING AND INCLUSION CONTRACT FROM $117,000 TO $71,000, $25,000 BY REDUCING THE $100,000 INCREASE FOR OUTSIDE LEGAL COUNCIL TO $75,000. EVEN WITH THE AMENDMENT THERE ARE STILL HEALTHY INCREASES FOR THE THESE NEW ITEMS. AND THE RESOLUTION ALSO INDICATES THE CITY STAFF COULD OFFER ALTERNATIVE FUNDING SOURCES FOR CONSIDERATION IF THAT'S THEIR PLEASURE. DON'T GET ME WRONG, I'M NOT SAYING THAT FUNDING PROPOSED FOR THESE NEW ITEMS IS NOT OF VALUE. THEY ARE AND I'M PARTICULARLY ENCOURAGED TO SEE THE ADDED FUNDING PROPOSED FOR THE PENSION FUND AND THE FIRE STATION MASTER PLAN. WHAT I AM SAYING IS THAT WE ARE EXTREMELY FORTUNATE THAT THE CITY REVENUE SITUATION AND OUTLOOK IS SO STRONG. AND INSTEAD OF DEVOTING THE ADDED REVENUE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY, IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE FOLKS WHO PAY THE BILLS ACTUALLY DIRECTLY BENEFIT FROM THE HEALTHY REVENUE POSITION. I WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT ON THE STATEMENT WE HEAR FREQUENTLY THAT THE CURRENT CITY PROCESS IS WORKING GREAT. AND THAT RESTORING LEAF PICKUP WILL CREATE SIFT RISKS AND ADVERSE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS. WHAT THAT ASSUMES IS THERE'S NO LEAVES IN THE STREET UNDER THE CURRENT PROCESS AND ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS DRIVE AROUND IN THE FALL AND EVEN IN THE SPRING FOR THAT MATTER, AND WHAT YOU SEE ARE LEAVES IN THE STREETS IN MANY, MANY PLACES. I THINK IT'S QUITE A STRETCH TO CONCLUDE RESTORING LEAF PICKUP WILL HAVE SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE IMPACTS. SO I HOPE YOU WILL AGREE AND SUPPORT THIS AMENDMENT TEMPERATURE AND THANK YOU FOR CONSIDERING IT.
04:18:34.609: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
04:18:39.113: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, MAYOR TAYLOR. I JUST HAVE A R COUPLE OF QUESTIONS BEFORE I GO FURTHER. WITH PRIOR SERVICE AND PRIOR YEARS, THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF CRITICISM, OR CONCERNS THAT IT DOES DEN GREAT THE QUALITY OF THE WATER, IT COMES TO SAFETY AND CLOGS DRAINS. HOW MUCH OF THAT IS THE CASE? AND HOW MUCH OF IT IS, I GUESS -- IF YOU ARE ONLY DOING THIS TWICE A SEASON, IF -- IF LEAF PICKIUM WAS RESTORED, IS THERE GO -- PICKUP WAS RESTORED, IS THERE A DIFFERENT WAY OF DOING IT TO MITIGATE THE ISSUES THAT RESIDENTS HAVE CONCERN ON? ARE WE GOING TO DO WHAT WE DID BEFORE? NEW TECHNIQUE? MORE FREQUENT PICKUP OR ANYTHING DIFFERENT IF THOSE CONCERNS WERE VALID CONCERNS TO BEGIN WITH?
04:19:45.414: >> WE WOULD NOT BE LOOKING AT MORE FREQUENT PICKUP, NECESSARILY. THAN TWICE A YEAR BECAUSE WE ARE TIME CONSTRAINED BY THE SEASON. WE CAN'T START PICKING LEAVES UP UNTIL THEY FALL, AND WE ARE PRETTY MUCH HAVING TO STOP WHETHER IT STARTS TO SNOW ON US. AND EVERY -- IN THE PAST SEASONS WHEN WE HAVE BEEN DOING STRAIGHT LEAF PICKUP, IT'S BEEN A STRUGGLE TO GET THE SECOND ROUND IN AND MANY TIMES WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN THE SECOND ROUND OF PICKUP IN. WOULD STAFF STAFF LOOK AT A DIFT METHOD OF PICKING UP? YES, IT'S BEEN A NUMBER OF YEARS SINCE WE HAVE DONE LEAF PICKUP. WE WOULD HAVE TO LOOK TO SEE WHAT THE CURRENT STATE OF THE INDUSTRY IS, BUT MANY COMMUNITIES HAVE MOVED AWAY FROM IT, GOING TO BAGGED PICKUP. BUT THERE ARE OTHER COMMUNITIES STILL DOING IT AND WE WOULD LOOK AT THAT. WHEN WE WERE DOING STRAIGHT LEAF PICKUP, WE ARE LOOKING AT ALTERNATIVES AS WE WOULD GO FORWARD BECAUSE IT WAS SO PAINFUL TO DO STRAIGHT LEAF PICKIUM. WE ARE -- PICKUP. WE WERE TRYING TO FIND A BETTER WAY TO DO IT. AS TO WATER QUALITY ISSUES INTUITIVELY, YOU WOULD THINK THAT LEAVES LAYING IN THE STREETS, WOULD DEGRADE THE WATER QUALITY. AT THE TIME THOSE ARGUMENTS WERE RAISED, WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY DECONTINUETIVE LITERATURE THAT ABSOLUTELY SAID IT WAS NASTY, NASTY FOR WATER QUALITY. FOLLOWWHEN WE WENT TO BAGHDADEDE STOPPED GETTING AS MANY COMPLAINTS ABOUT CLOGGED GUTTERS, LEAFED PILED IN THE STREET, ET CETERA.
04:21:45.799: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I MAY HAVE MORE QUESTIONS LATER THANK YOU. EARLY ON, I WAS MUCH MORE INTERESTED IN HAVING THIS PROGRAM RESTORED AND I STILL HAVE AN INTEREST IN IT, BUT IT'S NOT AS STRONG AS I HAD PRIOR. ONE THING THAT HAS CHANGED IS, THE DISCUSSION -- AND I HOPE THE PRACTICE OF YEAR-ROUND COMPOST. IF WE HAVE YEAR-ROUND COMPOSTING, THE RESIDENTS WON'T STRUGGLE TO MEET THE DEADLINE THAT WE STRUGGLED WITH, WITH MEETING IN THE PAST, WHEN COMPOST WAS -- THE PROGRAM TO COLLECT IT WAS CUT OFF, I THINK, FIRST WEEK IN DECEMBER. SO THAT ELIMINATES SOME OF THE NEED FOR IT PRIOR. IT'S WITH OUR EXTEND COMPEOPLE COLLECTION AND -- COMPOST COLLECTION AND WOULD THE COMPOST COLLECTION, IF IT GOES YEAR ROUND, BE ABLE TO COLLECT THE HOLIDAY TREES?
04:23:00.308: >> IF THEY ARE PLACED IN A BAG OR CONTAINER, YES. BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE PICK UP, COMPOST OR IF IT MEETS THE BUNDLED STICK REQUIREMENT THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE FOR YARD WASTE, YES. AND CURRENTLY WITH THE BAGGED PICKUP, WE HAVE EXTENDED, WHEN NECESSARY, THE PICKUP TYING IF THE LEAFS ARE SLOW COMING DOWN. AND WE HAVE CONTINUED TO RUN COMPOST ROUTES UNOFFICIALLY AFTER THE END. SO IF SOMEBODY IS A LATE SET OUT BEING A WEEK LATE OR TWO WEEKS LATE, WE DO PICK THOSE BAGS UP. SO ALTHOUGH WE -- MEAN, STAFF IS PROBABLY KEL KILLING ME AS WE SAY THIS, AS WE ANNOUNCE AHARD CUTOFF, IT'S NOT A HARD CUTOFF.
04:23:56.930: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I GUESS MY OTHER CONCERN KIND OF GO BACK TO THE FUNDING SOURCE. I WILL JUST, I GUESS, HAVE MAYBE HAVE HOWARD OR THE SPONSORS OF THE AMENDMENT MAYBE SPEAK TO IT, BUT I'M LOOKING AT THE ONGOING COSTS OF $370,000 AND WHERE THAT MONEY IS GOING TO BE COMING FROM. IT DOES -- I WAS WONDERING WHETHER THERE'S ANY OTHER PLACE IN THE GENERAL FUND TO DRAW THIS MONEY WITHOUT AFFECTING THOSE FOUR AREAS OR AT LEAST A COUPLE OF THEM BEING, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO THE SINKING FUND THAT IS SOMETHING I THINK IS IMPORTANT IN OUR BUDGET. AND REDUCING THE SINKING FUND CONTRIBUTION BY HALF IS A CAN CONCERN OF MINE.
04:24:55.423: >> Councilmember Lumm: I CAN SPEAK TO THIS? SO I ASKED QUESTIONS TO IDENTIFY THE FUNDING, OBVIOUSLY, AND HE WILL WALK YOU THROUGH THIS. ON THE SINKING FUND, THE CAPITAL SINKING FUND, SO THE FISCAL YEAR '20 AMOUNT AND THE ADMINISTRATOR'S BUDGET, I WOULD SAY THIS IS A NEW FUND. WE HAVEN'T HAD THIS BEFORE. IT'S $400,000. SO THIS PROPOSES TO USE HALF. SO $200,000 FROM THAT. $46,000 IS FROM THE INCREASE FROM THE INCLUSION CONTRACT, WHICH IS -- SO USING UP TO ABOUT $50,000 OF -- THERE'S STILL A HEALTHY INCREASE THERE, BECAUSE WHAT'S PROPOSED IS THIS NEW RECURRING EXPENSE OF $117,000 FOR THAT. THESE ARE ALL RECURRING FUNDS, RECURRING EXPENDITURES. THE OTHER FUNDING SOURCE, I THOUGHT WAS REASONABLE TO TAP IS SO WE'RE PROPOSING AN INCREASE IN OUTSIDE LEGAL COUNCIL FUNDING OF $100,000 FOR THIS YEAR, AND I'M PROPOSING TO USE $25,000 OF THAT. SO THAT LEAVES A HEALTHY INCREASE THERE. AND THEN $90,000 -- $99,000 IS REALLOCATING MONEY THAT'S PROPOSED FOR A NEW CONTRACT ADMINISTRATOR, AND WE -- I WILL JUST SAY ABOUT THAT, WE HAVE SERVED -- WE SURVIVED JUST FINE WITHOUT THAT POSITION. THAT'S A BRAND NEW ADMINISTRATIVE POSITION, AND MAYBE NICE TO HAVE, BUT, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE ALWAYS MANAGED WITHOUT THAT. SO THAT'S ALSO WHY I THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE A REASONABLE OFFSET AS WELL.
04:26:49.169: >> City Admin. Lazarus: SO IF I COULD RESPOND. THE REASON THERE IS A NEED FOR A SINKING FUND, THE GENERAL FUND DOESN'T RESPOND TO UPS AND DOWNS, PEAKS AND VALLEYS, PARTICULARLY WHEN WE EXPERIENCE NEEDS FOR MODIFICATIONS, IMPROVEMENTS. CAPITAL REPAIR AND REPLACEMENT OF CITY I FACILITIES. THERE ARE A LOT OF GENERAL FUND REQUIREMENTS COMING IN THE YEARS. WHILE WE HAVE SOME MONEY PUT ASIDE FOR DAM REPAIRS, THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE SUFFICIENT. THERE ARE FUNDS REQUIRED FOR THINGS OUT OF THE GENERAL FUN FOR PARK REPAIRS. AND WE ARE PUTTING TOGETHER A PROGRAM FOR OUR FACILITIES BUT STARTING FROM SCRATCH, WE NEED TO START BUILDING UP A FUND TO PROVIDE FOR THAT. THE TRAINING INCLUSION CONTRACT IS FUNDING THAT WAS BASED UPON A CONTRACT PROPOSAL THAT WE GOT. THAT'S WHY IT WAS A FAIRLY SPECIFIC NUMBER AT $117,000. THE OUTSIDE LEGAL COU COUNSEL WS AN ALLOWANCE TO MAKE SURE WHEN THE CITY ATTORNEY HAD A NEED FOR OUTSIDE LEGAL COUNSEL, THAT HE COULD BE RESPONSIVE TO IT, AND THE CONTRACT ADMINISTRATOR WAS A WAY TO ENSURE WE MEET ALL THE REQUIREMENTS FOR CONTRACT ADMINISTRATION, AS WELL AS INDIRECTLY FREEING UP MORE ATTORNEY TIME TO WORK ON ATTORNEY STUFF INSTEAD OF CONTRACT ADMINISTRATIVE THINGS. THAT'S WHY THE NUMBERS ARE IN THE BUDGET. AND $99,000 IS THE FULLY LOADED OF THE COST FOR THAT POSITION. THAT'S WHY WE PUT THOSE FUNDS IN THE BUDGET.
04:28:38.746: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
04:28:40.280: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THE SINKING FUND, WHY DID YOU CHOOSE $400,000. ARE WE AIMING TO HAVE A CERTACERTAIN A.M A.M. BY A CERT? WHAT WAS THE FORMULATION? HOW DID WE COME UP TO $400,000?
04:28:57.664: >> City Admin. Lazarus: IT'S AN ESTIMATE AT THIS POINT. WE ARE STILL PUTTING TOGETHER THE ACTUAL COST FOR CAPITAL REPAIR AND REPLACEMENT IN THE COMING YEARS. MS. LANCASTER IS HIDING IN THE BACK OF THE ROOM. SHE CAN HELP TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION AS WELL. ALONG WITH MR. CRAWFORD. IT'S NOT TIED TO A KNOWN REQUIREMENT. IT'S BUILDING OF A FUND.
04:29:18.785: >> TOM CRAWFORD, CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER. THE -- WE DID AN ANALYSIS OF THE CITY FACILITIES THAT INCLUDE FIRE STATIONS AND IT'S THE GENERAL FUND FACILITIES SPLITTING THOSE TWO AREAS AND WHEN WE PROJECT OUT THE NEEDS FROM THOSE ASSESSMENTS, IF YOU PUT THAT OUT AND IT LEVELS OUR NEEDS.
04:29:45.445: >> City Admin. Lazarus: BUT IT DOESN'T INCLUDE THE PARKS AND THE FIRE HOUSES.
04:29:50.984: >> I HAVE A QUESTION FOR MR. CRAWFORD.
04:29:55.022: >> Mayor Taylor: QUESTIONS,
04:29:55.622: >> Councilmember Lumm: ADMITTED LY A RHETORICAL QUESTIONS SO THE USE OF THAT ZENA ANA OFFSETS DOES NOT REQUIRE ACTUALLY CUTTING ANYTHING WE DO NOW, IT'S JUST A REDUCTION IN THE AMOUNT OF INCREASES, CORRECT?
04:30:19.913: >> I THOUGHT YOU SAID IT WAS RHETORICAL.
04:30:24.351: >> Councilmember Lumm: I KNOW THE ANSWER. THE ANSWER IS WE ARE REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF THE INCREASES.
04:30:30.723: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
04:30:31.624: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI FOR YOUR QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS. I WILL BE HONEST, THIS PROGRAM ENDED IN 2011 AND HAS NOT BEEN RELEVANT IN MY ADULT LIFE. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK OUR CITY HAS TRANSITIONED AWAY FROM REASONABLY WELL. I KNOW WE GET COMMENTS AND FEEDBACK THAT IT IS MISSED BUT I THINK IT'S A PROGRAM THAT OUR COMMUNITY HAS TRANSITIONED AWAY FROM WITH COMFORT. I WILL ALSO SAY IT'S SURPRISING TO SEE THE DOLLAR AMOUNT FOR -- TO BRING THIS PROGRAM BACK BEING SO SIMILAR TO YEAR-ROUND ORGANICS -- A YEAR-ROUND ORGANICS PICKUP PROGRAM. I MEAN, IT'S WITHIN $100,000 OF SIMILAR COSTS. I WILL SAY, YOU FLOW, ON THE BALANCE OF OUR BUDGET AND CONSIDERING TRADEOFFS, $370,000 A YEAR, ON ALMOST HALF A MILLION IN THE FIRST YEAR, I DON'T SEE THIS AS -- AS EARNING MY VOTE BUT I WILL SAY IF THIS DOES PASS, I WOULD REALLY ENCOURAGE THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR TO TAKE THE LOST T RESOLVE CLAUSE SERIOUSLY, THAT THERE MAY BE ALTERNATIVE FUNDING SOURCES TO CONSIDER, TO SUBSTITUTE FOR THOSE LISTED ABOVE AND WITH PARTICULARLY, THE CAPITAL SINKING FUND. I HEAR AT THIS TABLE AND I HAVE HEARD AT THIS TABLE FOR THREE YEARS, HOW MUCH WE WISH COUNCILS OF PREVIOUS DECADES AND GENERATIONS HAD INVESTED IN INFRASTRUCTURE IN THEIR DAY, TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE WEREN'T COREYING THE BURDEN OF DECADES PAST AND WE WERE IN A POSITION TO START FUNDING IN A SUSTAINABLE WAY OUR INFRASTRUCTURE BURDENS AND HELP GENERATIONS OF THE FUTURE WITH THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE BURDENS THEN. AND I THINK THAT'S A VERY NOBLE THING. I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD BE PROUD OF. AND IT'S -- IT'S A FANTASTIC GIFT THAT WE CAN GIVE TO COUNCILS OF THE FUTURE AND TO GENERATIONS OF FUTURE RESIDENTS AND I WOULD REALLY HATE TO SEE THAT -- THAT NEW ADDED OPPORTUNITY REDUCED. SO I WOULD REALLY -- IF THIS DOES PASS, I WOULD ENCOURAGE THE ADMINISTRATOR TO TAKE THE LAST RESOLVE CLAUSE SERIOUSLY.
04:32:50.197: >> Mayor Taylor: I PUT MYSELF EARLIER ON THE QUEUE HERE. I WAS AROUND IN 2011, WHEN WE PULLED BACK THIS PROGRAM AND THE PROGRAM EVER -- AND I DON'T REALLY WANT TO CALL IT STREET LEAF PICKUP BECAUSE WE DO PICK UP LEAVES ALL THE TIME THAT ARE IN THE STREET. WE PICK THEM UP WHEN THE RESIDENTS PUT THEM IN BAGS AND CARTS. THE PROGRAM WAS NEVER SUCCESSFUL. THAT'S THE FLAT OUT TRUTH AND IT WILL NOT BE SUCCESSFUL. WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IS THAT IN SOME YEARS AND IN SOME LOCATIONS, EVERYTHING WILL WORK OUT JUST RIGHT. IT WILL BE DREW  DRY WHETHER ITS SUPPOSED TO BE DRY AND THE LEAVES WILL FALL WHEN THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO FALL. ON THE OTHER HAND, THERE WILL BE TIMES WHEN THE LEAVES ARE NOT GOING TO FALL WHEN THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO FALL AND THE RAIN IS GOING TO COME OR THE SNOW IS GOING TO COME AND WE ARE NOT ABLE TO PICK UP THE MATTED FROZEN LEAVES IN FRONT OF YOUR HOUSE AND IT'S GOING TO BE LOUSY. THAT'S HOW THIS PROGRAM WORKS. AND THAT'S WHAT WE ARE SIGNING UP FOR. FURTHER UPON THAT, WE HEARD THE CHALLENGES SOLID WASTE FUND GOING FORWARD AND NOW WE WANT TO $470,000 ON THIS POORLY -- THIS NEVER TO BE WELL EXECUTED PROGRAM, AND THEN WE -- THE PROPOSAL IS TO ELIMINATE AN INTERNAL EFFICIENCY TO REDUCE TRAINING, AND INCLUSION -- TO REDUCE TRAINING INCLUSION CONTRACT, REDUCE NECESSARY LEGAL FEES AND IN MY VIEW, ALL THE MORE DISTURBING -- DISTURBING OVERSTATES THE CASE, UNWISE, REDUCING OUR LONG-TERM CAPITAL PROGRAM. WE TALK ABOUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE, AND THIS IS A DILIGENT COMMITMENT TO PAYING FOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND WHAT IS NECESSARY. I BELIEVE TAKING THAT MONEY OUT OF THIS SOURCE WOULD BE UNWISE. I BELIEVE RESTARTING WHAT IS GOING TO BE A FAILED PROGRAM IS EVEN MORE UNWISE. I WILL BE VOTING AGAINST THIS. COUNCILMEMBER GRIZ WALD. -- GRISWOLD.
04:35:05.131: >> Councilmember Griswold: WE HAVE AN AGGRESSIVE PROGRAM TO PLANT MORE TREES ESPECIALLY IN THE RIGHT-OF-WAY, AS WELL AS AT OUR PARKS. I LIVE IN AN AREA WITH MANY MATURE TREES IN THE RIGHT-OF-WAY, CLOSE TO THE ROAD WHERE THERE AREN'T SIDEWALKS. AND WITHOUT A LEAF PICKUP PROGRAM, WHAT ENDS UP HAPPENING IS THOSE TREES THAT ARE IN THE RIGHT-OF-WAY TEND TO FALL INTO THE STREET AND THEN WE HAVE STREET SWEEPERS COME BY, QUITE FREQUENTLY. SO I THINK THAT IN DEBATING THIS PROJECT, WE NEED TO FIND OUT HOW MUCH ADDITIONAL STREET SWEEPING WE ARE DOING AND WHAT'S THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THAT.
04:35:48.140: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
04:35:49.008: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. THERE'S A LOT TO LIKE IN THIS RESOLUTION. AND HATS OFF FOR COUNCILWOMAN LUMM WELL OFFSETS. THAT'S THE RIGHT WAY TO GO. I REALLY APPRECIATE IT. HAS IT REALLY BEEN SINCE 2011? IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE. I GUESS NOT HAVING AN ALTERNATIVE AND RESIDENTS DO PAY TWICE, THROUGH THEIR TAXES AND PRIVATE HAULERS. I DON'T HAVE THE BUDGET FOR THAT PERSONALLY, AND SO WE SHIFTED TO A MULCHING MOWER, TO DEAL WITH THE LEAVES AND THEY ARE PLENTIFUL IN MY NECK. WOODS. WE HAD TO CHANGE OUR BEHAVIOR AS COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN POINTED OUT. IT'S WORKING FOR ME. MAYBE A LITTLE TOO WELL. MY YARD IS SO LUSH, I'M PUSHING UP AGAINST A CHAPTER 41 VIOLATION. IT'S INSANE HOW MUCH MULCH HAS DONE TO THE HEALTH OF MY LOCAL ECOSYSTEM. SO THE FIRST YEAR'S COST IS ACTUALLY $840,000 AFTER THE INITIAL CAPITAL PURCHASE AND THE 370 TO OPERATE IF I'M READING THAT CORRECTLY AND THEN $370,000 MOVING FORWARD IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS PAID BY THE OFFSETS AND I AGREE THAT IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO TO -- WHEN WE HAVE SOME EXCESSES, THAT WE SHOULD TURN IT BACK INTO WAYS THAT INCREASE RESIDENT SERVICE. I'M -- I'M SORRY TO REPORT THAT I DON'T THINK THIS IS THE RIGHT WAY. I WOULD LOVE TO TAKE THESE OFFSETS THAT YOU HAVE SO KEEN LeIDENTIFY -- KEENLY IDENTIFIED AND SPENT THEM ON ANY NUMBER OF THINGS THAT WOULD BENEFIT MORE RESIDENTS MORE FULLY, I GUESS I WILL SAY. AND THAT'S NOT IN THE CARDS TONIGHT. I HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT THOSE ARE. I CAN THINK OF A LOT OF THINGS THAT I WOULD DO WITH $500,000 AND $370,000 MOVING FORWARD EVERY YEAR. THAT'S SOME SERIOUS, SERIOUS CHUNK OF CHANGE THERE. BUT I'M FINDING MYSELF SADLY UNABLE TO SUPPORT THIS EXPENDITURE, ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF ALL THE RECURRING EXPENSES WE ARE SEEING -- I KNOW IT'S WITH DIFFERENT FUNDS, THE WATER SYSTEMS, THE CAPITAL IMPROFMENTS, THE IDEA THAT WE ARE FLIPPING OUR CARBON EVERY YEAR TO KEEP THE EMERGING CONTAMINANTS OUT OF THE WATER. I'M REALLY FOCUSED ON THAT SORT OF THING AND I JUST -- I -- I'M GOING TO LOOK TO THESE OFFSETS IN THE FUTURE FOR -- TO PUT TO MORE AMENABLE USE. UNFORTUNATELY, I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS.
04:38:34.640: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION?
04:38:37.076: >> Councilmember Bannister: I THINK IN WARD ONE, I THINK WE ARE MORE INTERESTED IN SNOW REMOVAL. SO MAYBE GOING FORWARD WE CAN DISCUSS HOW TO DO LEAF PICKUP? SOME NEIGHBORHOODS AND KNOW REMOVAL IN OTHERS.
04:38:54.626: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER EATON, COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, I'M SORRY.
04:38:58.764: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANKS. I JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT JUST IN GENERAL, THE TOTAL GENERAL FUND THIS YEAR, JUST TO PUT THIS IN PERSPECTIVE, THE TOTAL GENERAL FUND WENT UP ABOUT 5 MERCHANDISE. IT'S ABOUT 5% INCREASE THIS YEAR. THAT IS A LOT OF MONEY. THERE'S SO MUCH NEW MONEY IN THIS BUDGET. AND FOR THE FISCAL YEAR '20, IN TERMS OF NEWER INCREASE FOR RECURRING GENERAL FUN EXPENSES, THIS LIST THAT I'M TAPPING INTO BUT NOT EVERYTHING. IF YOU LOOK AT THE LIST, WHAT STANDS OUT? AND EYE TRIED TO POINT THAT OUT EARLIER IN TERMS OF THE PENSION CONTRIBUTION, THE SINKING FUND, ET CETERA, ET CETERA, ET CETERA I DIDN'T TOP THE FIRE STATION MASTER PLAN, THE NEW FTE CONTRACT, AND THE NEW FTE AND HR BENEFITS SPECIALIST. YEAH. THE WHOLE LIST. WELL, WHAT'S -- WHAT IS OBVIOUS ABOUT THIS AND THE TOTAL GENERAL FUND RECURRING EXPENDITURE INCREASES OF OVER $1.7 MILLION IS THAT THEY ARE ALL INTERNAL. SO AGAIN, WE HAD THIS HUGE INFLUX EVER REVENUE THIS YEAR, SOMETHING WE HAVE NOT SEEN IN MULTIPLE DECADES AND THIS IS PROPOSING TO TAKE ABOUT $1.7 MILLION, $370,000 OF THESE INCREASES AND DIRECTING IT TO A SERVICE FOR RESIDENTS. UTILIZING IT EXTERNALLY. SO THAT'S WHAT I'M ASKING YOU TO CONSIDER.
04:40:40.533: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
04:40:42.201: >> Councilmember Eaton: I DIDN'T RAISE MY HAND.
04:40:46.405: >> Mayor Taylor: MY APOLOGIES. FURTHER DISCUSSION. ROLL CALL VOTE STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER EATON.

04:41:14.833: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN AMENDMENT AS AMENDED.
04:41:19.572: >> Councilmember Lumm: AMENDMEN. THE AMENDMENT TO INCREASE POLICE STAFFING IN THE FISCAL YEAR BUDGET '20 BY TWO OFFICERS TO HAVE FREE PATROL AND NEIGHBORHOODS.
04:41:31.983: >> Mayor Taylor: SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER EATON. YOU STILL HAVE THE FLOOR, COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
04:41:36.555: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. AND, AGAIN, THANK YOU COUNCILMEMBER EATON FOR COSPONSORING THIS. WE KNOW THE HISTORY OF POLICE STAFFING LEVELS. THE NUMBER OF SWORN OFFICERS IS 47 LOWER OR 27% THAN IT WAS 25 YEARS AGO. AND THE TOTAL FTEs IN THE POLICE DEPARTMENT ARE 92 LOWER OR 38% LOWER. WHAT YOU MAY NOT REALIZE, THOUGH, IS THAT EVERYTHE LAST FIVE YEARS, THE NUMBER OF UNASSIGNED PROACTIVE PATROLLING, OR FREE PATROL HOURS HAS DROPPED SIGNIFICANTLY. DROPPED 34% FROM 42,424 HOURS IN 2013, TO 27,941 HOURS IN 2018. WE HAVE ALL HEARD THE REQUESTS FROM OUR RESIDENTS FOR ADDITIONAL NEIGHBORHOOD PATROLS AND TRAFFIC ENFORCEMENT. WE HEARD THE REQUESTS TO IMPROVE PEDESTRIAN SAFETY CITYWIDE AND ESPECIALLY SCHOOLS AND HEARD THE REQUEST FOR A GREATER NEIGHBORHOOD IN DOWNTOWN PRESENCE TO IMPROVE BOTH REAL AND PERCEIVED SAFETY. SO WHEN THE TIME OFFICERS ARE AVAILABLE TO ADDRESS THESE INTO EDS, DROPS BY OVER 30% -- THESE NEEDS DROPPED BY OVER 30%. IT IS A TREND THAT WE SHOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT AND TAKE NOTICE. THE CONSULTANT THE CITY ENGAGED HILLARD HEINTZE IMPROVED POLICE COMMUNITY RELATIONSHIPS AND BUILD TRUST, ONE, ESTABLISH A POLICE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION; AND TWO, REINVIGORATE OUR COMMUNITY POLICING AND OPERATIONALIZE A COMMUNITY POLICING STRATEGY. AND THE SECOND, REQUIRES RESOURCES AND OFFICERS. AT ITS PEAK, THE CITY'S COMMUNITY POLICING UNIT HAD 23 FTEs. TODAY, WE HAVE THREE. YES, THREE. THAT'S NOT MUCH OF A COMMUNICATE ENGAGEMENT PRESENCE. SPECIFICALLY, THE AMENDMENT ADDS TWO WORN OFFICERS TO THE BUDGET PROPOSED BY THE ADMINISTRATOR, INCREASING THE DEPARTMENT FTEs, FROM 152 TO 154. THE ADMINISTRATOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET ADDS TWO POLICE CADET POSITIONS AND THAT'S GOOD. IT WILL FREE UP SOME TIME FOR PATROL. IT IS NOT ADEQUATE TO MEANINGFULLY ADDRESS THE NEEDS THAT WE HAVE. THE AMENDMENT DOES NOT PRESCRIBE WHAT THE OFFICERS WILL DO. THAT'S NOT APPROPRIATE. BUT IT REQUIRES THE CONSIDERATION BE GIVEN TO DEPLOYING THE ADDITIONAL OFFICERS IN UNASSIGNED PROACTIVE PATROL, TO IMPROVE NEIGHBORHOOD AND SCHOOL SAFETY. THE CITY FACES A REAL CHALLENGE OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS, AS THERE ARE 45 OFFICERS ELIGIBLE TO RETIRE AND THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS APPLYING TO BE POLICE OFFICERS IS DECLINING NATIONWIDE. RECOGNIZING THAT, THIS AMENDMENT ALSO DIRECTS THE ADMINISTRATOR TO EVALUATE ALTERNATIVES AND TOOLS SUCH AS DROTT. PROGRAM, WHICH IS -- DROP PROGRAM WHICH IS A PROGRAM THAT ALLOWS AN EMPLOYEE TO RETIRE FROM THE PENSION PLAN BUT REMAIN EMPLOYED AND DELIVER TO COUNCIL BY THE END OF NOVEMBER, RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE THE CITY'S RECRUITING, HIRING, ONBOARDING AND RETENTION PROCESSES. THE COST OF ADDING TWO OFFICERS IS 1 1 $191,144 AND IS A RECURRG EXPENSE. IT USES LESS THAN 10% OF THE $2.2 MILLION ANNUALLY IN COUNTY MILLAGE PROCEEDS, THE AMENDMENT WOULD REDUCE EXPENDITURES FOR CLIMATE ACTION PROGRAMS BY $95,000 EACH, WHICH REPRESENTS 11% OF THE INCREASED FUNDING FOR EACH. IN OTHER WORDS, INSTEAD OF $880,000 IN NEW FUNDING, CLIMATE ACTION PROGRAMS AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING WOULD BOTH BE RECEIVING $785,000 IN NEW FUNDING. STILL QUITE A HEALTHY INCREASE AND ABSOLUTE AMOUNT. I BELIEVE THERE'S A COUPLE OF COMPELLING REASONS WHY USING A RELATIVELY SMALL PORTION OF THE COUNTY PUBLIC SAFETY AND MENTAL HEALTH MILLAGE ON PUBLICATION SAFETY IS WHOLLY APPROPRIATE. IT WAS THE MENTAL HEALTH AND PUBLIC SAFETY MILLAGE AFTER ALL, SO IT'S QUITE LIKELY THAT A LARGE NUMBER OF RESIDENTS EXPECTED THERE WOULD BE ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO ARE POLICE. SECOND, WE ASKED RESIDENTS SPECIFICALLY, HOW THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS NEW REV NEW SPENT AND THEY AL -- REVENUE SPENT AND THEY ALLOCATED MORE TO PUBLIC SAFETY THAN CLIMATE ACTION AND SLIGHTLY LESS TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THE FISCAL YEAR '20 BUDGET AS PROPOSED DOES NOT AT ALL REFLECTS PREFERENCES. RATHER IT ALLOCATES FOUR TIMES MORE TO CLIMATE ACTION AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING # $80,000 THAN TO POLICE. $220,000 RECURRING. THE CITY WOULD BE ALLOCATING SIGNIFICANTLY MORE RECURRING FUNDS, FUNDING THE CLIMATE ACTION AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAN TO POLICE, HOWEVER WITH SOME FOLKS WE ARE UNFORTUNATELY NOW AT THE POINT ON THE COUNTY MILLAGE PROCEEDS DEBATE WHERE ANYTHING OTHER THAN 40/40/20 IS UNACCEPTABLE AND AMOUNTS TO STEALING MONEY FROM CLIMATE ACTION AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING, WHICH IS NOT ACCURATE. ALL OF THIS IS NEW MONEY. WHETHER IT'S $100,000, $780,000 OR $880,000. THE TWO AMENDMENTS ON THE AGENDA TONIGHT, THIS ONE AND AMENDMENT SEVEN WOULD IF ADOPTED RESULT IN ABOUT $700,000 EACH IN FUNDING FOR CLIMB ATE ACTION AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING FROM THE COUNTY MILLAGE. IT'S $785,000 EACH, IF THIS JUST -- IF JUST THIS AMENDMENT IS ADOPTED. ANYWAY, THE BOTTOM LINE FOR ME IS THAT ALLOCATING A SMALL PORTION OF THE PROCEEDS FROM THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH AND PUBLICSAFETY IS CONSISTENT WITH RESIDENTS APPROACHES AND WITH A DECLINING AMOUNT OF FREE PATROL AND POLICING EFFORT THAT WON'T CONTINUE FOREVER. BUILDING COMMUNITY TRUST WILL BE MORE DIFFICULT. AS FORMER CHIEF CETOS SAID AND THIS HAS NOT CHANGED ANN ARBOR IS A REACTIVE FORCE NOW AND THE WAY FORWARD IN IMPROVING BOTH ACTUAL AND PERCEIVED SAFETY AND SECURITY HAS BECOME MORE PROACTIVE IN COMMUNITY ORIENTED AND THAT REQUIRES MORE STAFFING. I HOPE YOU WILL AGREE AND SUPPORT THIS AMENDMENT TONIGHT AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.
04:47:56.101: >> Mayor Taylor: PUTTING MYSELF IN THE QUEUE, A FEW WEEKS AGO, I DID NOT ANNOUNCE MY INTENTION TO VETO A MATTER UNTIL AFTER THE VOTE. AND THAT HAD ELICITED SOME CRITIQUE. IT ALSO ENLISTED CRITIQUE AND I WILL ANNOUNCE IT WITH RESPECT TO AMENDMENTS 3 AND 7. I AM -- I AM INCREDIBLY PROUD OF THIS BUDGET AND THIS COUNCIL FOR THE FIRST TIME IS TAKING A MEANINGFUL ACTION WITH RESPECT TO CLIMATE ACTION. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY MEMORY, WE ARE CONTRIBUTING IMPORTANT CAPITAL DOLLARS TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND ANN ARBOR ABSOLUTELY DEMANDS BOTH AND WE NEED BOTH. FOR ME, AND I BELIEVE FOR THE COMMUNITY, CLIMATE ACTION FUNDING IS A REDLINE AND FOR ME, AND I BELIEVE THE COMMUNITY AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUNDING IS A REDLINE. AND I WILL DO EVERYTHING I CAN WITHIN MY AUTHORITY TO HONOR IT. FOR ME, AND FURTHER AS I HAVE DESCRIBED ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS, I BELIEVE THAT THE 40/40/20 CREATES HONOR TO UTILIZE THE COUNTY MILLAGE REBATE FOR THE DESCRIBED PURPOSES AND I WILL DO EVERYTHING WITHIN MY AUTHORITY TO HONOR THIS OBLIGATION. THIS SHOULD NOT COME AS A SURPRISE TO ANYONE. I SAID IT ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE. BUT I WILL VOTE AGAINST THESE AMENDMENTS. I BELIEVE THEY ARE INSCENTENT WITH OUR COMMUNITY'S -- INCONSISTENT WITH OUR COMMUNITY'S ASPIRATIONS. I BELIEVE WE HAVE AN INCREDIBLY OUTSTANDING POLICE DEPARTMENT. AND -- BUT I ALSO BELIEVE THAT OUR NAYSENT EFFORTS WITH RESPECT TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING ARE NECESSARY. IF THESE ARE ADOPTED IN THE PASSED BUDGET THEN I WILL REGRETLY VETO THE BUDGET IN ITS ENTIRETY. THE UNAMENDED ADMINISTRATOR'S BUDGET WILL BECOME THE ADOPTED BUDGET. OTHER AMENDMENTS THAT WE CONSIDER HERE TODAY MAY, OF COURSE BE REPROPOSED AT ANY TIME, AND AT THAT TIME THEY ARE SUBJECT TO AN EIGHT VOTE REQUIREMENT. COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
04:50:07.364: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO FOLLOW THAT UP, BUT I WILL TRY. FOR ME, SIMILARLY, THE FUNDING SOURCE FOR THIS IS A NONSTARTER. I THINK THE COMPARISON OF THE NEARLY $800,000 FOR CLIMATE AGENCY AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING CANNOT AND SHOULD NOT BE COMPARED TO THE $220,000 NUMBER IN NEW RECURRING REVENUE FOR PUBLIC SAFETY. I THINK THAT MORE APPROPRIATELY, IT SHOULD BE COMPARED TO THE $30 MILLION BUDGET THAT OUR POLICE DEPARTMENT HAS AND DESERVES. I -- I'M NOT WHOLLY OPPOSED TO INCREASING THE EMPLOYEE COUNT IN OUR POLICE DEPARTMENT. HOWEVER, THAT SAID, YOU KNOW, A RECURRING THEME OF IF MY MESSAGE AS WE INCREASE THE RECURRING EXPENSES AND THE FIXED COSTS, ESPECIALLY AS IT -- AS IT PERTAINS TO EMPLOYMENT, WE NEED TO BE INCREDIBLY DILIGENT AND SHOULD OUR NEXT CHIEF, YOU KNOW, WITH THE SUPPORT OF A POLICE COMMISSION, MAKE THE RECOMMENDATION THAT WE NEED TO ADD FT Es TO THE POLICE DEPARTMENT, THAT'S -- THAT'S AN ARGUMENT AND THAT'S POLICY DIRECTION THAT I CAN LISTEN TO. FROM WHERE WE SIT RIGHT NOW, I CAN'T EVEN COME CLOSE TO SUPPORTING A TRADEOFF BETWEEN TWO FTEs, WHICH WHICH COULD DOWN THE LINE BE NECESSARY, BUT ARE NOT A SOLUTION TO OUR RETIREMENT ISSUE IN THE POLICE DEPARTMENT. RETIREMENT ISSUE IN THE POLICE DEPARTMENT CAN'T BE BY ADDING A TOTAL HEADCOUNSEL ON PAPER. IT'S NEEDS TO BE DONE THROUGH ALTERNATIVE MEASURES AND I APPRECIATE YOU OUTLINING THEM. BUT TO ME, THE FUNDING SOURCE IS THE NONSTARTER HERE. I KNOW COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER AND I SERVE ON THE ADVISORY BOARD AND THAT BODY IS ALREADY STARTING TO SEE MULTIPLE APPLICATIONS START TO CUE UP FOR WHAT IS RIGHT NOW HYPOTHETICAL FUNDING. THERE ARE ORGANIZATIONS CLAWING AND ITCHING TO GET TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT CAPITAL AND THAT CAPITAL WILL BE LEVERAGED IN STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDING TO HOPEFULLY HOUSE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE, AND -- ESPECIALLY IF WE CONTINUE IT OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST EIGHT YEARS, ON THE MILLAGE. ON THE CLIMATE ACTION SIDE, WE SEE DR. STULTS' AGGRESSIVE FIVE-YEAR PLAN THAT UTILIZES THOSE DOLLARS TO A PRACTICAL APPLICATION. AN APPLICATION THAT WILL IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE, AND REDUCE OUR CASHAN FOOTPRINT AS A COMMUNITY -- CARBON FOOTPRINT AS A COMMUNITY. SO I WILL LEAVE IT THERE. THAT SAID, CERTAINLY NOT OPPOSED TO INCREASING THE HEAD COUNT OF OUR POLICE DEPARTMENT. SHOULD A FUTURE CHIEF AND OUR POLICE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION SEE IT AS A -- AS A PROGRESSIVE AND IMPORTANT STEP. THANK YOU.
04:53:31.601: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
04:53:32.602: >> Councilmember Grand: I WAS GOING TO ASK DR. STULTSS TO COME UP HERE. BUT GIVEN THE MA MAYOR'S STATEMENT. I WAS IMPRESSED BY DR. STULTS' PLAN AND AS WELL AS MS. HALL, THEY LEVERAGED THEIR DOLLARS SO MUCH AND I SEE DERRICK MILLER, WHO HAS BEEN WITH COMMUNITY ACTION NETWORK WHO HAS BEEN WAITING OUT THIS EVENING. THOSE DOLLARS FROM BEING LIAISON TO THE HOUSING COMMISSION, SOME OF THOSE WERE CANNED DOLLARS THAT WOULD BE PUT AT RISK IF THIS WERE TO PASS. AND THEY DO AN OUTSTANDING JOB PROVIDING SERVICES, INCLUDING IN WARD THREE. AND LEVERAGE THEM TO A GREAT DEGREE. SO A SMALL INCREASE IN WHAT WE CAN BE PROVIDING THIS FUNDING, TRANSLATES INTO SERVICES FOR OUR KIDS AND FAMILIES AND OUR COMMUNITY. SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THE MAYOR'S STANCE ON THIS, THIS ALSO FOR ME IS A -- IS IN -- YOU KNOW, AN OATH AND A COMMITMENT TO OUR COMMUNITY FOR THESE IMPORTANT CRITICAL PRIORITIES. SO I WILL CLEARLY NOT BE SUPPORTING THIS OR AMENDMENT 7 THIS EVENING.
04:54:49.513: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
04:54:50.414: >> Councilmember Hayner: WELL THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. SO THESE OFFSETS THAT COUNCILMEMBER LUMM IDENTIFIED AND SHE MUST HAVE READ MY MIND. I WAS TYPING AWAY ON MY CALCULATOR HERE. I SEE NO REASON WHY THE OFFSETS THAT WERE RECOMMENDED IN AMENDMENT 4 CON BE USED INSTEAD OF TAKING MONEY AWAY FROM THESE OTHER CRITICAL NEEDS THAT EVERYONE HAS IDENTIFIED. AND SO I MEAN, IF WE'RE GETTING TWO OFFICERS TO FOR APPROXIMATELY 192 THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THIS FIRST YEAR, AND FOUR OF THEM IS 382. THAT'S ALMOST EXACTLY THE SAME OFFSETS THAT SHE IDENTIFIED AND I SEE NO REASON THAT WE COUNT USE THESE OFFSETS TO FUND THESE OFFICERS AND I SEE COME ACROSS MY DESK. I WILL FIELD BACK TO THE SPONSOR OF THIS RESOLUTION. I SEE SHE SENT A RESOLVE CLAUSE TO AMEND THIS AMENDMENT, WHICH I FULLY SUPPORT.
04:55:40.764: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU. I DID SEND YOU ALL --
04:55:44.000: >> Mayor Taylor: I HAVE A QUEUE WITH RAMLAWI, ACKERMAN AND LUMM, AND THEN GRISWOLD.
04:55:52.108: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, MAYOR TAYLOR.
04:55:55.378: >> Councilmember Lumm: I SENT YOU AN AMENDMENT.
04:55:57.614: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. IT'S OBVIOUSLY GARNERED A LOT OF ATTENTION. I JUST HAVE A QUICK QUESTION, SINCE WE HAVE DEPUTY FORSBERG HERE. WHEN DID THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN FORM ITS POLICE DEPARTMENT? WHEN WAS IT -- WHAT YEAR WAS --
04:56:18.401: >>  11992, '93.
04:56:23.539: >> Councilmember Lumm: I WILL SAY WHEN I WAS -- DO YOU MIND?
04:56:26.943: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WAS WONDERING IF IT CORRELATED WITH THE 15-YEAR TIME FRAME WITH THE PRECIPITOUS DROP IN OUR OWN POLICE FORCE, WHEN IT COINCIDED WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN'S ADOPTION OF A POLICE FORCE.
04:56:42.191: >> Councilmember Lumm: NO, HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. I WAS ON THE COUNCIL IN ''93, AND U OF M HAD A POLICE FORCE. AROUND THAT TIME WE HAD ABOUT 225 SWORN OFFICERS AT THE CITY AND I KNOW IN TALKING TO FORMER AND CURRENT U OF M POLICE CHIEFS, ONE OF WHOM WORKED FOR THE CITY HAS A DEPUTY CHIEF FOR MANY YEARS, THEY CONFIRMED THAT WHILE WE HAVE -- AND I SHOULD LET DEPUTY CHIEF FORSBERG SPEAK TO THIS, BUT MY UNDERSTANDING ALONG THAT WHILE WE HAVE A SEAMLESS GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH THE U OF M, THE CITY AND THE U OF M, IS NOT THE U OF M'S ROLE TO POLICE CITY PROPERTY, CITY STREETS, THEY ARE PATROLLING -- YOU CAN SPEAK TO THIS BETTER THAN ANYBODY. THIS IS HOW IT WAS DESCRIBED TO ME IN THE PAST. WHEN THEIR CARS ARE OUT, THEY ARE ENSURING THAT THEIR PROPERTIES, THEIR BUILDINGS ARE SECURE, THEIR CAMPUS IS SECURE. AGAIN, WE HAVE A SEAMLESS RELATIONSHIP THAT CANNOT -- THEY ARE NOT THE CITY'S POLICE FORCE. [ OFF MICROPHONE COMMENTS ]
04:57:57.867: >> Councilmember Lumm: I'M JUST SHARING WHAT I --
04:57:58.968: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  IF I COULD TAKE BACK THE MIC. IT'S GETTING LATE. I WANTED A QUICK ANSWER AND IT'S HARD TO GET ONE RIGHT NOW.
04:58:05.842: >> Councilmember Lumm: SORRY.
04:58:06.475: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: I'M A LITTLE DIS -- JUST DISAPPOINTED, ACTUALLY, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, MAYOR, THAT INSTEAD OF OFFERING AMENDMENTS OR ALTERNATIVE, TO THE FUNDING SOURCE, WHICH WE HAVE JUST RECEIVED, BY THE SPONSORS OF THIS AMENDMENT, THAT YOU JUST PLAYED THE VETO CARD. AND THAT'S -- WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, I THINK WE CAN IMPROVE OUR LEADERSHIP SKILLS THERE.
04:58:39.642: >> Mayor Taylor: I HAD REACHED OUT TO COUNCILMEMBER LUMM IN ADVANCE ASKING HER TO --
04:58:48.618: >> Councilmember Lumm: TELLING ME -- SAY IT LIKE YOU LAID IT ON ME.
04:58:55.658: >> Mayor Taylor: I HAD REACHED OUT TO INDICATE THAT, YOU KNOW --
04:58:58.327: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  WE ARE DISCUSSING A PRETTY HEAVY DOCUMENT RIGHT NOW.
04:59:02.531: >> Mayor Taylor: ABSOLUTELY.
04:59:03.133: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: AND THERE'S A COUPLE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT ARE BEING IN QUESTION AND RATHER THAN LOOK AT CREATIVE WAYS TO FUND THIS -- BECAUSE I DON'T SUPPORT USING THE MENTAL HEALTH REBATE MILLAGE FOR THE FTEs MYSELF, FOR THE SWORN POLICE OFFICERS BUT I DO RECOGNIZE THE NEED FOR POLICE OFFICERS AND I HAVE HEARD IT FROM MORE THAN ONE POLICE CHIEF OR PERSON ANSWERING THOSE QUESTIONS, THAT THERE IS A NEED AND IT WOULD -- IT WOULD FULLY APPRECIATE MORE OFFICERS AND WE'RE AT A POINT WHERE WE HAVE $5 MILLION NEW MONEY COMING IN. AND RATHER THAN LOOK FOR CREATIVE WAYS TO FIND $191,000, WE BEGIN THE DISCUSSION WITH VETOING THE ENTIRE BUDGET AND I FEEL THAT -- PROBABLY IS ISN'T E BEST WAY TO GOING.
05:00:07.197: >> Mayor Taylor: I HEAR YOU.
05:00:07.831: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I HOPE WE CAN EVOLVE THE DISCUSSION AND THE DEBATE WITHOUT HITTING THE NUCLEAR OPTION WITHOUT OUR FIRST CHOICE.
05:00:17.406: >> Mayor Taylor: I REACHED OUT TO COUNCILMEMBER LUMM AND INDICATING THAT THERE WERE --
05:00:20.609: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: WHEN WE HAD AN ISSUE WITH THE VEE TO BE --
05:00:24.881: >> Mayor Taylor: OFFERING TO DISCUSS. [ OVERLAPPING SPEAKERS ]
05:00:38.928: >> Mayor Taylor: IN THE QUEUE, I HAVE COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
05:00:46.135: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANKS, MR. MAYOR. IN VERY RECENT MAYOR, WE TALKED ABOUT POLICE OFFICERS, IN THE LAST BUDGET MEETING INCREASED THE HEAD COUNT OF THE POLICE DEPARTMENT, AND THEN JUST PRIOR TO ME COMING ON COUNCIL, IN CALENDAR YEAR '15, '16, WE HAVE -- THERE ARE MORE OPPORTUNITIES WHEN IT MAKES SENSE AND IS A WELCOMED CHANGE AND I GREAT CHALLENGE HE. AND I DON'T THINK ANY OF US DISAGREE ON THAT POINT. BUT I THINK US SITTING HERE AND WITH RESPECT, I CHOOSE A BETTER ANALOGY, IF I WAS MORE AWAKE BUT TO ARMCHAIR COACH AND SAY THIS IS HOW THE POLICE DEPARTMENT FROM OUR VANTAGE POINT NEEDS TO SOLVE ITS STAFFING ISSUES, IS IN MY MIND, A LITTLE BACKWARD WHAT IS THE PROBLEM THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO SOLVE? AND CREASING EFFORTS FROM THE POLICE ACADEMY AND THEN FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE MAINTAIN A STEADY LEVEL OF STAFFING IN OUR POLICE DEPARTMENT, NOT JUST ADD TWO FTEs ON PAPER. WE CAN ADD TWO FTEs BUT WE CAN'T FILL THOSE POSITIONS FASTER THAN THE PEOPLE RETIRE. WE WILL STILL HAVE STAFFING ISSUES IN THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THOSE ARE VERY DIFFERENT CONVERSATIONS. SO I WOULD LOVE TO GIVE THE NEXT POLICE CHIEF TO MAKE AN EVALUATION IN OUR POLICE DEPARTMENT AND FIGURE OUT WATT STAFFING NEEDS -- OUT WHAT THE STAFFING NEEDS ARE AND COME BACK AND RESOLVE AND EXPERT OPINION, THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO DO, TO STABILIZE THAT STAFFING. SO I WILL LEAVE IT THERE. AND WHEN YOU HAVE TIME TO INTRODUCE THE POTENTIAL OF THE VETOES AND IT DOESN'T AFFECT ME. I WANTED TO BRING THAT UP AND PROMPT THE AMENDMENT TO CHANGE THE FUNDING SOURCE.
05:03:00.168: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU. I DID SEND YOU ALL AN AMENDMENT AND IT WASN'T JUST THAT, THAT PROMPTED IT. I WESTB WANTED TO HAVE A PUBLIC DISCUSSION OF WHY USING 10% OF THESE MILLAGE PROCEEDS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. AND ON THE MAYOR'S USE OF THE VETO, YES, YOU DID CALL ME AND I GAVE YOU AN EARFUL. I SEE THIS AS QUINTESSENTIALLY UNDEMOCRATIC OF YOU TO USE YOUR VETO FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING -- WHAT WE ARE DOING TONIGHT IS OUR BIGGEST RESPONSIBILITY AND THESE ACTIONS TONIGHT ESTABLISHED THE PRIORITIES FOR THE CITY. IT'S OUR ONE REAL SHOT AT THIS, BECAUSE I GOT TO TELL YOU GUYS, AMENDING THE BUDGET IN THE CALENDAR YEAR, IT REQUIRES EIGHT VOTES. WE SEE HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO GET SIX VOTES TONIGHT. THIS IS YOUR BIG OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE A BITE OUT OF THE APPLE AND ESTABLISH PRIORITIES FOR THE FOLKS THAT YOU ARE REPRESENTING, AND THAT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT AND SO CRITICAL AND FOR THE MAYOR, IN MY OPINION, TO EXERCISE HIS VETO POWER OVER COUNCIL BUDGET AMENDMENTS, AGAIN, THIS IS DEMOCRACY IN ACTION. THAT, TO ME, IS INDESCRIBEALELY UNDEMOCRATIC. I HAVE SERVED WITH THREE MAYORS, ALL WHO EXERCISED VEE THOUGH POWERS FROM TIME TO TIME, NEVER, EVER, FOR BUDGET AMENDMENTS, APPROVING THE BUDGET. THEY STAYED ABOVE THE FRAY. AND THAT AS A LITTLE BUILT OF EARFUL YOU GOT IN OUR PHONE CONVERSATION THAT DAY. SO I DID SEND YOU AN AMENDMENT. SO I PROPOSED TO CHANGE THE FIRST RESOLVE CLAUSE. I HAVE SO MANY NOTES HERE. FOR THE -- SO THAT THE FUNDING SOURCE FOR THE $191,144 IS FUNDED, WHICH IS WHY I FLIP FLOPPED THE -- AND DID THE LEAF PICKUP AMENDMENT FIRST, BECAUSE I HAD A FEELING THAT MIGHT FAIL. SO I'M USING THOSE OFFSETS THAT I WAS GOING TO UTILIZE FOR LEAF PICKUP. SO DELETE THE FIRST RESOLVE CLAUSE AND REPLACE IT WITH WHAT HE ISN'T YOU, TO INCREASE THE FTEs BY TWO AND THE EXPENDITURES INCREASING BY 191,0001911# $4,000, AND THE COT ADMINISTRATOR TO INCUR THE COST, AND NEW RECURRING COST AND $92,144 TO REDUCE THE CAPITAL SINKING FUND, EXCUSE ME FROM $400,000, AND ALSO A NEW RECURRING EXPENSE. [ OFF MICROPHONE COMMENTS ]
05:06:16.865: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THAT AMENDMENT FRIENDLY TO THE BODY.
05:06:23.138: >> YES.
05:06:23.405: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN?
05:06:24.306: >> Councilmember Ackerman: ACTUALLY, I'M SORRY -- YEAH. IT CAN BE.
05:06:32.915: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCIL WOMAN GRISWOLD.
05:06:34.883: >> Councilmember Griswold: THIS IS AN INTERESTING ACADEMIC PROBLEM TONIGHT. I WOULD ASK NIP IN THE COUNCIL OR THE AUDIENCE TO COME WITH ME AND LOOK AT SOME OF OUR CROSSWALKS AND LOOK AT WHAT ACTIVITY IS OCCURRING. WE ARE SPENDING MORE MONEY ON PEDESTRIAN SAFETY, AT LEAST THAT'S THE TITLE, AND OUR PEDESTRIAN CRASHES HAVE GONE UP FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS AND THEY ARE AT A RECORD LEVEL THIS YEAR. I WAS AT A PARTY LAST NIGHT AND SOMEONE WAS TELLING ME ABOUT HOW A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO A PERSON MADE A RIGHT-HAND SIDE AT A STOP SIGN AT STOPPING AND HIT NOT ONE, BUT TWO PEDESTRIANS. NOW WE HAVE A CRISIS, AND WE CAN SAY PEDESTRIAN CRASHES ARE UP NATIONWIDE. THAT MAY BE TRUE, BUT IT'S NOT TRUE WHERE PEOPLE HAVE ADOPTED VISION ZERO AND SPENDING MORE MONEY ON PEDESTRIAN SAFETY. WHEN A'S MISSING HERE? ENFORCEMENT. THERE'S VERY LITTLE ENFORCEMENT AND EVERY TIME A TALK TO SOMEONE AT A SCHOOL, THEY PLEAD FOR MORE ENFORCEMENT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SCHOOL DAY. WE DO NOT HAVE ADEQUATE POLICE OFFICERS FOR THAT. ANOTHER THING THAT'S HAPPENING AND IT'S GOING TO BE ADDRESSED AT THE STATE LEVEL, DISTRACTED DRIVING IS AT AN ALL-TIME HIGH. WE WILL HAVE MORE OFFICERS WITH MORE ENFORCEMENT.
05:08:03.738: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
05:08:06.408: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU. AS I WAS SAYING, IT'S LIKE COUNCCOUNCILMAN LUMM READ MY MI. THE PROBLEM WE ARE TRYING TO SOL OFF IS RESIDENTS -- SOLVE IS RESIDENTS ARE COMING TO US SAYING WHY ARE THEY GOING THIS SPEED ON ALL OF THESE STREETS AND I SENT AN EMAIL TO ARANOURNEARLY DEPARTED POLICE CF AND I IMMEDIATELY PICKED UP THE PHONE AND CALLED HIM AND I UNDERSTAND YOUR ANSWER IS I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE TO DO IT AND I CAN'T BE EVERYWHERE ALL THE TIME. AFTER SO MANY OF THESE COME ACROSS MY DESK, I HAVE TO SUM THEM UP AND ASK FOR HELP. IT'S THE LEAST I CAN DO. I UNDERSTAND THE HELP IS NOT, THERE AND SO THIS IS SOLVING THAT PROBLEM, AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED AND THERE'S ALL KINDS OF REQ OTHER PROBLEMS, ESPECIALY WHEN WE HAD THE GREAT SERIES OF INTERVIEWS WITH THE POTENTIAL POLICE CHIEFS AND THEY ALL HAD GOOD THINGS TO SAY ABOUT INCREASING COMMUNITY POLICING. AND THE WAY YOU DO THAT IS YOU GET THEM OUT THERE ON THE BIKES AND THE STREETS AND BACK IN THE SUBSTATIONS AND SO ON. AND WRITING TICKETS AND ENFORCING OUR NEW PEDESTRIAN ORDINANCE. THIS IS A MEANS TO ACHIEVE THAT, AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED AND I FULLY SUPPORT THIS, ESPECIALLY IN ITS REVISED FORM WHERE THE FUNDING IS COMING FROM THE NEW RECURRING EXPENSES OUTSIDE OF THOSE THAT ARE AS WE GET TO THE AMENDMENT SEVEN ARE NEAR AND DEAR TO SOME FOLKS. WE ARE TREATING THIS MENTAL HEALTH REBATE MILLAGE MONEY AS IF IT'S SOME KIND OF GOLDEN MONEY THAT'S COMING INTO THE CITY THAT DOESN'T HAVE ANY OF THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF OTHER INCRECREASES IN FUNDS BECAUSE OF THE NEEDS WE THINK WE WILL FULFILL WITH IT AND SO TO SET THIS ASIDE AND FIND AT MONEY SOMEWHERE ELSE, I FULLY SUPPORT THIS AMENDMENT AND IF IT'S ACCEPTED AS FRIENDLY WHICH HAS BEEN, THE WHOLE OF IT MOVING FORWARD. THANK YOU.
05:10:16.438: >> Mayor Taylor: GRAND AND THEN ACKERMAN.
05:10:17.939: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. I WON'T BE SUPPORTING THIS. I THINK COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN SPOKE ELOQUENTLY IN TERMS OF RECRUITING POLICE OFFICERS WE HEARD IN INTERVIEWS ON FRIDAY ABOUT NEED FOR DIVERSITY IN OUR POLICE FORCE AND HOW CHALLENGING THAT CAN BE WHEN 95% OF THE STUDENTS AT POLICE ACADEMIES ARE WHITE MALES. THERE ARE BIG CHALLENGES IN TERMS OF RETIREMENTS HASN'T IN TERMS OF -- AND THIS, TO ME, JUST -- IT DOES SEEMBACKWARDS. I UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE COMMUNITY DESIRES IN TERMS OF ENFORCEMENT, BUT WE JUST SEEDED A POLICE -- AN OVERSIGHT COMMISSION THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE GIVING INTO OUR POLICY DECISION MAKING AND I DON'T -- AND SO IT'S NOT EVEN A QUESTION, AND I HATE TO PUT YOU ON THE SPOT HERE, BUT IF WE GAVE YOU THIS MONEY, AND I THINK THIS IS A QUESTION THAT'S BEEN ASKED IN THE PAST, HOW DIFFICULT WOULD IT BE TO ACTUALLY GET THE NUMBERS UP TO 154 FTEs. AND WHAT YOU WOULD DO WITH THEM?
05:11:25.974: >> THE LAST TIME YOU ASKED THAT QUESTION, I THINK WE MADE SOME CHANGES INTERNALLY, AS FAR AS THE CAPACITY FOR HIRING, WHETHER WE ARE DOING BACKGROUND. SO WE WOULD INCREASE THE BANDWIDTH FOR THE HIRING. WE HAVE A NUMBER OF HIRING PROJECTS UNDERWAY, WHERE WE HAVE PERIODIC HIRINGS WHETHER IT'S LATERAL, THE OFFICERS COMING IN OR SPONSORING PEOPLE TO COME TO THE POLICE ACADEMY. SO I'M NOT SURE THE GIST OF WHY YOU ARE QUESTION. I THINK THERE'S OTHER WAYS THAT BY HIRING NON-SWORN POLICE OFFICERS, WE -- THE PSS CADET PROGRAM THAT'S FOR BUDGET APPROVAL, THAT PROGRAM ALLOWS US TO TAKE A POLICE OFFICER WOULD IS WORKING OUR FRONT DESK AND PUT A CADET ON THE DESK AND TAKE REPORTS AND HAVE THE POLICE OFFICER GO OUT AND TAKE CALLS.
05:12:18.560: >> Councilmember Grand: OKAY. THANK YOU. WE ALSO HEARD THAT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY WHAT THE NUMBER OF OFFICERS THAT WE HAVE, BUT WHAT THEY DO WITH THEIR TIME AND COULD YOU DO MORE, YOU KNOW, COMMUNITY POLICING WITH THE NUMBER OF POLICE THAT YOU HAVE? AND IS THE CADET PROGRAM FREEING UP THE SPACE THAT YOU HAVE?
05:12:40.347: >> WE CAN RELOOK AT HOW WE ARE DEPLOYING OUR RESOURCES NOW. GIVING US ADDITIONAL STAFF WOULD GIVE US THE FLEXIBILITY TO DO MORE. WE HAVE A NUMBER OF IDEAS ON WHAT WE WOULD DO WITH ADDITIONAL STAFF, WHETHER IT'S SWORN OR NON-SWORN. SO, YOU KNOW, DATA ANALYSIS, NUMBER OF OTHER OPTIONS, GRANT COORDINATION, OR PUTTING COMMUNITY POLICE OFFICERS IN THE LIAISON ROLES. IF WE WERE TO HIRE SOMEBODY TODAY OR START A PROCESS TODAY, FOR SOMEBODY, IT WOULD TAKE ANYWHERE FROM NINE MONTHS TO A YEAR FOR US TO GET THAT OFFICER OUT ONLY THEIR OWN, AND WORKING.
05:13:19.921: >> Councilmember Grand: OKAY. THANK YOU. KNOW, I -- AND I APPRECIATE THAT. I'M STILL NOT GOING TO SUPPORT THIS BECAUSE I WOULD RATHER HAVE -- I WOULD RATHER, YOU KNOW, GO AT IT FROM A PERSPECTIVE AS FAR AS A RETROSPECTIVE APPROACH. I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE THE SINKING FUND TO PROTECT SOME OF THE ASSETS WHERE THE POLICE OFFICERS WILL BE WORKING. I APPRECIATE YOUR INPUT.
05:13:52.586: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN AND THEN NELSON.
05:13:55.056: >> Councilmember Ackerman: COUNCILMEMBER NELSON DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE.
05:13:58.893: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I WANTED TO ASK YOU ANOTHER QUESTION. SO YOU SAID THAT IF YOU TARTED A PROCESS NOW -- STARTED A PRPROCESS NOW, IT WOULD BE NINE TO 12 MONTHS OUT. IT STRIKES ME THAT THAT'S ENOUGH LEAD TIME FOR OUR POLICE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION TO HAVE MEANINGFUL CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHAT OUR POLICE FORCE -- WHAT THEIR FEELINGS ARE ABOUT WHAT OUR POLICE FORCE SHOULD BE DOING DIFFERENTLY OR MAYBE JUST ANY OPINIONS THAT THEY WANTED TO EXPRESS. BUT THE QUESTION THAT I WANTED TO ASK BECAUSE I KNOW I'M NOT THE ONLY PERSON SITTING AT THIS TABLE WHO HAS DONE A POLICE RIDE-ALONG AND ITS ANECDOTAL. THE PERSON I WAS RIDING WITH, HE TOLD ME -- AND BEING WITH HIM, GOING FROM ONE CRISIS TO THE NEXT, VARIOUS KINDS OF THINGS, YOU KNOW, ACCIDENTS AND DRUNK GIRL IN A RESTAURANT. HE TOLD ME THAT THE THING HE WISHED WAS TRUE OF THE POLICE DEPARTMENT WAS THAT THEY HAD ENOUGH PEOPLE TO JUST CHECK ON SITUATIONS AS OPPOSED TO JUST RUNNING TO CRISES. AND WHEN I WAS WITH HIM THAT NIGHT, THERE WAS A SITUATION WHERE HE SAID, HE KNEW OF A WOMAN WHO HAD -- WHO WAS BEING STALKED AND THE GUY WAS COMING AROUND AND HE WANTED TO CHECK ON HER. WE WERE HALFWAY THERE WHERE SOMETHING ELSE PULLED HIM AWAY. MY QUESTION FOR YOU, WAS MY EXPERIENCE UNIQUE? WAS I WITH LIKE THE ODD BALL OFFICER WHO THINKS IT WOULD BE GOOD TO HAVE A COUPLE MORE PEOPLE ON THE FORCE? OR, I MEAN, WHAT IS YOUR ASSESSMENT OF THAT. YOU CERTAINLY KNOW YOUR PEOPLE MORE THAN I DO.
05:15:46.267: >> WE ARE VERY BUSY AND THE DATA THAT COUNCILMEMBER LUMM IS PRESENTING THAT. SO THE FREE PATROL TIME IS THE DEDISCRETIONARY TIME BETWEEN THE CALLS THEY ARE RESPONDING TO. SO AS THAT PERCENTAGE OF TIME DECREASES THEY HAVE LESS TIME FOR PROACTIVE ENFORCEMENT OR ENGAGEMENT WITH THE COMMUNITY.
05:16:08.156: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I GUESS MY QUESTION WAS:  I UNDERSTAND THAT, AND I AND WHAT I'M SAYING THAT THE OFFICER I SPOKE TO WAS SAYING LIKE THAT WAS PRETTY MUCH NUMBER ONE HIS LIST. HE WISHED HE HAD MORE TIME TO WALK AROUND A COMMUNITY AND GET TO KNOW COMMUNICATE MEMBERS IN JUST A FRIENDLY WAY. OR JUST CHECKING UP ON THINGS THAT AREN'T YET A CRISIS AND I'M JUST ASKING IF YOU THINK THAT'S A REPRESENTATIVE OPINION OF YOUR COLLEAGUES.
05:16:38.485: >> YES. MY ANSWER WOULD BE YES.
05:16:39.486: >> Councilmember Nelson: THANK YOU.
05:16:42.723: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN. ZA>> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTIONS. THIS IS MY THIRD TIME SPEAKING AND I WOULD LIKE TO OFFER AN AMENDMENT AND I WILL BE DONE. IT'S ALREADY BEEN CIRCULATED AND IT WAS ESSENTIALLY -- I THINK -- BUT, ESSENTIALLY, IT WOULD DECREASE THE FTE INCREASE FROM TWO TO ONE, SO THE TOTAL FTEs IN THE POLICE DEPARTMENT,  5, 253:00 AND THEN IT WOULD CHANGE THE --  52, 53 AND THEN IT WOULD CHANGE THE BUDGET, AND IT WOULD LEAVE THE FTE FOR CONTRACT ADMINISTRATOR, BUT IT WOULD TAKE AWAY REDUCTION IN THE CAPITAL FUND FOR 400,000 TO 3 # $0,000. SO I HOPE IT'S CLEAR. ESSENTIALLY, I WESTBOUNDED TO JUST PROTECT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. I THINK THAT'S ONE OF OUR UTMOST DUTIES TO FIND A SUSTAINABLE MEANS TO FUND OUR INFRASTRUCTURE. IT'S AN INVEST, YOU KNOW, FOR THE NEXT TEN YEARS. IT'S AN INVESTMENT FOR THE NEXT GENERATION. IT'S SO, SO CRITICAL. I APPRECIATE THE FUNS FOR THE POLICE DEPARTMENT BUT I WILL BE VERY GUARDED.
05:18:23.290: >> Mayor Taylor: SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRAND. THE AMENDMENT TO THE AMENDMENT. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
05:18:29.195: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU. THANK YOU, MR. ACKERMAN. COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN, I APPRECIATE YOUR INCHING FORWARD THAT YOU WOULD BE OKAY ADDING A POLICE OFFICER. I DON'T THINK THAT'S REMOTELY ADEQUATE AND I WON'T BE SUPPORTING THE AMENDMENT. JUST A QUICK SUMMARY OF HOW -- THINGS THAT WE -- I THINK SHOULD GUIDE US. WE HAVE 45 OFFICERS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE TO RETIRE. THIS RESOLUTION ALSO SPEAKS TO THE DROP PROGRAM. THAT MICHIGAN STATE POLICE USE THE DROP PROGRAM. THE ENTIRE STATE OF FLORIDA, CALIFORNIA, AREA A ARIZONA, YOUT GOOGLE IT. AND AT THE MEET AND GREET LAST WEEK, WITH THE POLICE OFFICER, THE CHIEF CANDIDATES, I HAPPENED TO VISIT WITH A COUPLE OF POLICE OFFICERS AND I ASKED THEM ABOUT THE DROP PROGRAM AND ONE EXTRA WHO -- AN OFFICER WHO HAS BEEN WITH THE CITY FOR TO 20 YEARS SAID ABSOLUTELY THERE WOULD BE INTEREST AND THAT'S A WAY TO RETAIN TALENT THAT WE HAVE. IT'S TRULY A -- YOU KNOW, A WIN/WIN FOR -- AND THIS OFFICER, PARTICULAR OFFICER ACKNOWLEDGED. HE SAID THAT IT DOESN'T ADD MORE COST FOR THE UNITS OF GOVERNMENT, WHICH IS WHY HE FELT IT IS ACCEPTABLE AND ACTUALLY SOMETHING THAT MANY, MANY, MANY COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE NO YOU USING. AND TO BRIDGE -- ARE NOW USING. AND TO BRIDGE THIS GAP BETWEEN THE STAFFING CHALLENGES AND THE DIFFICULTIES IN RECRUITING NEW OFFICERS. AND I REALLY THINK WE ARE IN CRISIS MODE WITH THE 45 WHO ARE ELIGIBLE TO RETIRE, GIVEN HOW OUR PATROL HOURS HAVE DECREASED SO -- FREE PATROL HOURS. SO SIGNIFICANTLY, AND IN FISCAL YEAR 23 -- 2013, I TOO ID TO ADD THAT HE. THAT FAILS. AND ALSO REQUESTED THAT THE DDA IN THAT CONSIDER FUNDING THREE MEET COPS. THAT FAILED. IN IF FISCAL YEAR '15, TRIED AGAIN TO ADD TWO. THAT FAILED '16, '17, '18, AND HERE WE ARE TODAY A, SO I'M 0 FR 6. WE NEVER SAW REVENUE COMING INTO THE CITY LIKE WE ARE WITH THIS BUDGET. AND IF WE DON'T DO THIS NOW, KNOWING WHAT WERE FACING, SHAME ON US. AND GOOD LUCK EXPLAINING TO ALL OF THOSE FOLKS WHO CALL YOU ABOUT THE CARS SPEEDING THROUGH THE NEIGHBORHOODS AND ALL OF THAT. THIS IS SO MUCH MORE -- YOU KNOW, MAJOR CRIME STATS THAT WE HEAR FROM PEOPLE WHO DON'T SUPPORT THE -- YOU KNOW, THOSE DON'T TELL THE WHOLE STORY. I MEAN, IT'S ABOUT -- AS COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD SAID, PEDESTRIAN SAFETY AND ENFORCE OUR ABILITY TO DO ENFORCEMENT, WHEN WE HAVE THREE TRAFFIC COPS. IT'S NOT DOABLE. SO THAT'S THE END OF MY PITCH.
05:21:54.601: >> Mayor Taylor: MY SUSPICION IS PEOPLE HAVE THEIR MINDS MADE UP --
05:21:58.238: >> Councilmember Hayner:  ARE WE SPEAKING TO THE AMENDMENT?
05:22:00.941: >> Mayor Taylor: THE AMENDMENT TO THE AMENDMENT.
05:22:03.844: >> Councilmember Hayner: GOING TWO TO ONE?
05:22:06.513: >> Mayor Taylor: ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION ON THAT? THE AMENDMENT TO THE AMENDMENT.
05:22:19.192: >> Councilmember Eaton: NO.
05:22:20.027: >> Councilmember Nelson:  NO.
05:22:20.827: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: NO.
05:22:24.330: >> Councilmember Hayner:  NO.
05:22:24.931: >> Councilmember Bannister: NO.
05:22:27.200: >> Councilmember Griswold: NO.
05:22:29.402: >> Councilmember Lumm: NO.
05:22:29.970: >> Councilmember Grand: YES.
05:22:30.570: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES.
05:22:33.006: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
05:22:33.506: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION FAILS.
05:22:35.542: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE AMENDMENT? COUNCILMEMBER GRAND AND THEN BANISTER.
05:22:44.051: >> Councilmember Grand: I CIRCULATED AN AMENDMENT IN RESPONSE TO COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN'S. IT WOULD REQUIRE FTEs TO BE IN PLURAL. A RESOLVE THAT THE ICPOC PROVIDES INPUT INTO THE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES INTO THE FTEs.
05:23:03.970: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THAT FRIENDLY TO THE BODY? COUNCILMEMBER EATON?
05:23:07.207: >> Councilmember Eaton: NO. I FIND THIS AN OVERREACH BY THAT M PARTICULAR COMMISSION. I WOULD NOT WANT US TO DESCRIBE THE JOB THAT A POLICE OFFICER DOES AND I DON'T WANT THE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION TO DESCRIBE THE JOB THAT A POLICE OFFICER SHOULD DO. I THINK THIS IS REALLY A CONSIDERABLE OVERREACH OF OUR RESPONSIBILITIES.
05:23:33.666: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE AMENDMENT. THE AMENDMENT TO THE AMENDMENT. COUNCIL RAMLAWI AND THEN NELSON.
05:23:39.305: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. I WOULD HAVE TO AGREE WITH COUNCILMEMBER EATON. I THINK THIS IS GOING TOO DEEP INTO MICROMANAGING. I THINK THE ORDINANCE SPELLS OUT WHAT ICPAC DOES AND THEY DON'T NEED FURTHER INSTRUCTION ON HOW TO USE A PARTICULAR POLICE OFFICER. I JUST THINK IT'S NOT NECESSARY AN OVERREACH AND WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING IT.
05:24:02.128: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
05:24:02.995: >> Councilmember Nelson: WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY HAS ALREADY BEEN SAID. THIS FEELS REALLY SPECIFIC AND AS MUCH AS I I BELIEVE IN WHAT THE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION CAN DO FOR OUR COMMUNITY IN TERMS OF OVERSIGHT, I THINK IT'S MORE THAN WE EXPECTED FOR THEM TO ACTUALLY BE ARTICULATING SPECIFIC DIRECTION FOR A SPECIFIC PERSON. THAT SEEMS LIKE A LOT.
05:24:26.286: >> Councilmember Grand: I WILL WITHDRAW, JUST NOTING THE IRONY THAT I THINK WE ARE MICROMANAGING BY ADDING TWO OFFICERS THAT WEREN'T CALLED FOR. AND EXCEEDING OUR ROLE IN DOING SO. SO I WILL WITHDRAW.
05:24:40.767: >> Mayor Taylor: ANY OBJECTION TO IT BEING WITHDRAWN? FURTHER DISCUSSION OF AMENDMENT AS AMENDED. COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER. KANZ I DID HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION FOR DEPUTY CHIEF FORSBERG. I KNOW OUT IN WARD ONE, SEVERAL TIMES A WEEK WE HAVE PEOPLE CLAMORING FOR TRAFFIC ENFORCEMENT AND PARKING ENFORCEMENT AND SUCH, BUT ONE OTHER ARTICLE THAT I RECENTLY READ WAS THAT SOME DETECTIVES WERE LOCAL SOUTHEASTERN MICHIGAN DETECTIVES WERE SAYING THERE'S AN URGENT NEED FOR SVUs, SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT HELP AND A CRITICAL NEED FOR CRIMINAL SEXUAL CONDUCT, THE SCS -- CSC, EXCUSE ME. CRIMINAL SEXUAL CONDUCT. SO TO HANDLE ALL THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE INCREASE THAT WE MIGHT BE EXPERIENCING IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, AND CAN YOU SPEAK TO WHETHER HERE IN ANN ARBOR WE HAVE A NEED FOR SVU AND CSC?
05:25:52.104: >> YES, I THINK PART OF -- WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT OUR DEPARTMENT'S REALIGNMENT, WHEN WE HAVE A NEW CHIEF IN PLACE, I WOULD BE CRITICAL TO LOOK AT THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT CONCEPT, AS FAR AS THE TYPE OF CRIME, THE NATURE OF THE INVESTIGATION THAT HAS TO TAKE PLACE AND ALL IN PERSONAL VIOLENCE, WHETHER IT'S SEXUAL ASSAULT, STALKING AND JUST THE NATURE OF THOSE CRIMES AND THE TIME COMMITMENT OF THOSE INVESTIGATIONS, IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO RELOOK AT HOW WE ARE DOING THAT RIGHT NOW, NOT TO SAY THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SWEEPING CHANGES BUT WE DEFINITELY -- THAT'S SOMETHING WE WANT TO LOOK AT FOR SURE.
05:26:28.007: >> Councilmember Bannister: SO BETWEEN TRAFFIC ENFORCEMENT AND THESE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND STALKING AND WHATNOT, YOU COULD KEEP THESE TWO OFFICERS BUSY?
05:26:37.082: >> YES.
05:26:42.555: >> Councilmember Bannister: THANK YOU.
05:26:44.424: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE.
05:26:48.327: >> Councilmember Nelson: WHAT ARE WE VOTING ON?
05:26:50.596: >> Mayor Taylor: THE AMENDMENT. THE AMENDMENT AS AMENDED.
05:26:55.601: >> Councilmember Hayner:  AS A WHOLE.
05:26:57.637: >> Mayor Taylor: YES, THE AMENDED AMENDMENT NUMBER THREE.
05:27:01.707: >> Councilmember Nelson: OKAY.
05:27:06.312: >> Councilmember Eaton: YES.
05:27:06.913: >> Councilmember Nelson: YES.
05:27:07.914: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES.
05:27:09.281: >> Councilmember Hayner: YES.

05:27:16.288: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES.
05:27:16.889: >> Councilmember Grand: NO.
05:27:17.490: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES.
05:27:22.027: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
05:27:22.528: >> Clerk Beaudry: THE MOTION CARRIES.
05:27:23.963: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN MOTION. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
05:27:29.101: >> Councilmember Lumm: THIS WILL BE IT FOR ME. THIS IS AMENDMENT FIVE, THIS IS ONE-TIME FUNDING POTENTIAL NEW STREET LIGHTS AT LOCATIONS OTHER THAN CROSSWALKS.
05:27:42.815: >> Mayor Taylor: SECONDED BY? COUNCILMEMBER EATON? YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
05:27:51.056: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER EATON FOR COSPONSORING THIS AMENDMENT AS WELL. THIS ONE IS PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD, SO I WILL BE BRIEF. IN 20 S. ALUMNI, COUNCIL LIFTED A MORATORIUM ON NEW STREET LIGHTS THAT HAD BEEN IN PLACE FOR ALMOST A DECADE. AT THAT TIME WE CREATED A SEPARATE NEW STREET LIGHT ACCOUNT, STAFF ESTABLISHED A MODEL TO PRIORITIZE LOCATIONS FOR POTENTIAL NEW STREET LIGHTS AND WE FUNDED THE ACCOUNT WITH $110,000. IN EACH YEAR SINCE, THE BUDGET HAS INCLUDED BETWEEN 100 AND $150,000 IN FUNDING NEW STREET LIGHT AND THE MONEY HAS BEEN PUT TO GOOD USE. STAFF HAS INDICATED THAT BY THE END OF THIS FISCAL YEAR, ALL PREVIOUS FUNDING WILL HAVE BEEN SPENT OR IS DESIGNATED FOR NEW STREET HEIGHTS AT SPECIFIC LOCATIONS. -- STREET LIGHTS AT SPECIFIC LOCATIONS IT INCLUDES $135,000, BUT THE FULL AMOUNT IS EARMARKED FOR UPGRADED OR NEW STREET LIGHTING AT CROSSWALKS. THAT'S APPROPRIATE, AND IT'S GOING TO TAKE THREE TO FOUR YEARS TO ADDRESS THE CROSSWALK LIGHTING NEEDS. I DON'T WANT TO IMPEDE THAT PROGRESS FOR CROSSWALK LIGHTING IN ANY WAY, BUT I DO BELIEVE THERE'S STILL A NEE NEED FOR FUNDING. THIS ADDS $100,000 IN ONE-TIME FUNDING IN THE BUDGET FOR THAT PURPOSE. TO PAY FOR THE $100,000, THE AMENDMENT STIPULATES THAT $100,000 OF THE $425,000 IN THE BUDGET EARMARKED FOR STREET LIGHT REPLACEMENT IS UTILIZED FOR NEW STREET LIGHTS. THAT SHOULD NOT BE A MAJOR PROBLEM, AS THE IF IS CAL YEAR 'TO INCREASED THE REPLACEMENT BY $65,000 ANYWAY BUT IT OFFERS THE STAFF THE FU OPPORTUNITIES O SUGGEST A DIFFERENT FUNDING SOURCE FOR COUNCIL CONTRIBUTION. THE AMENDMENT ALSO DIRECTS THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR TO PRESENT RECOMMENDATIONS TO ARE ONGOING RECURRING FUNDING, AMOUNTS AND SOURCES THAT WOULD COMPLETE THE CROSSWALK LIGHTING UPGRADES OR ADDITIONS AND ESTABLISH ADEQUATE ADDITIONS AT NON-CROSSWALK LOCATIONS AND STREET LIGHT REPLACEMENT. I THINK WE WOULD BENEFIT FROM HAVING A LONG-TERM PLAN FOR ALL ASPECTS OF STREET LIGHT AND THAT'S WHAT THE THIRD RESOLVE CLAUSE IS OFFERING. I'M OFFERING THIS AMENDMENT BECAUSE ADEQUATE STREET LIGHTING IS A KEY CONTRIBUTOR TO SAFETY AND THE PERCEPTION OF THE SAFETY IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS AND NEAR ANN ARBOR SCHOOLS AND THAT'S A PRIORITY WE WILL ALL SHARE. HOPEFULLY YOU WILL ALL AGREE AND SUPPORT THIS STEVENSON. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.
05:30:12.665: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION.
05:30:14.066: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I DO SUPPORT THIS BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE BY THE TIME THIS ROLLS IN, IF THIS PASSES TONIGHT, THAT IT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE WORK THAT THE ENERGY COMMISSION HAS BEEN DOING ON THE DARK.
05:30:23.342: >> SKIES INITIATIVES AND THAT WE ARE SELECTING THE CORRECT KIND OF LIGHTING AND THE CORRECT KIND OF CONTRAST LIGHTING AND SO ON. THAT'S MY BIGGEST CONCERN WITH THE STREET LIGHTING RIGHT NOW.
05:30:36.522: >> Mayor Taylor: I BELIEVE THERE IS A POLICY IN PLACE.
05:30:42.494: >> City Admin. Lazarus: I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR WHAT MS. GRISWOLD HAS TO SAY BEFORE I ANSWER.
05:30:48.200: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WANTED TO BRING THAT UP.
05:30:49.702: >> Councilmember Griswold: THERE IS WORK ON A DARK SKIES INITIATIVE FOR THE PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY. IT HASN'T BEEN COMPLETED YET, BUT I HAVE BEEN IN CONVERSATION REGARDING THAT. I DID GET AN OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW AND COMMENT ON THE DARK SKIES POLICY FOR PRIVATE PROPERTY. I'M VERY CONFIDENT THAT WE WILL HAVE AN EXCELLENT PROGRAM THAT WILL FOCUS ON POSITIVE CONTRAST LIGHTING AT OUR CROSSWALKS AND MINIMIZING LIGHT POLLUTION.
05:31:29.308: >> Councilmember Ackerman: WE WILL BE SCHEDULING A PUBLIC HEARING FOR THE PRIVATE PROPERTY SIDE OF THAT CONVERSATION SOON.
05:31:35.146: >> City Admin. Lazarus: SO I BELIEVE YOUR QUESTION HAS BEEN ANSWERED.
05:31:38.217: >> Councilmember Hayner: ABSOLUTELY. THANK YOU, EVERYONE.
05:31:41.986: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE AMENDMENT -- THE MAIN MOTION AS AMENDED? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
05:31:52.698: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU. I WOULD LOOK TO MOVE AMENDMENT NUMBER SIX.
05:31:58.136: >> Mayor Taylor: SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTERRER. YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
05:32:01.773: >> Counc
05:32:02.674: >> Councilmember Hayner:  SO I BROUGHT THIS FORWARD. THIS AMENDMENT IS TOEN THE DEER CULLING OPERATIONS IN FISCAL YEAR 2020 AND 2021. AND I KNOW THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR'S BUDGET SHOWED A TAPERING OFF OF THE COST FOR THAT PRO E  PROCESS. BE THAT AS IT MAY, I FIND THAT THE BUDGET CYCLE GIVES US AN OPPORTUNITY TO PLAY WHAT IF WITH MONEY AND SO IT'S A GAME THAT PEOPLE LIKE TO MAY AND I LIKE TO PLAY IT TOO. I HAD THE DISTINCT PLEASURE OF BEING INVITED TO A SAFE HOUSE -- A PANEL DISCUSSION THAT TOOK PLACE AT SAFE HOUSE AND THEIR TOTAL BUDGET IS $1 MILLION A YEAR AND THEY HELP 6,000 PEOPLE OUT THIS. IT'S AN INCREDIBLE ORGANIZATION THAT DOES A LOT WITH A   LITTLE. AND THEY PACEICALLY SPEND THE EQUIVALENT -- THEY BASICALLY SPEND THE EQUIVALENT OF 17 # $1. AND WE SPEND $1,300 TO KILL A DEER. THE SURVEY THAT CLAIMS TO HAVE 75% SUPPORT FOR THIS, CAREFUL OBSERVERS OF THE SURVEY WILL HAVE NOTED THAT ON THE BOTTOM OF THE FIRST ONE, THERE WAS A LITTLE FOOTNOTE THAT SAYS THE SURVEIL GOAL IS TO REACH 75%. AND SO I COULDN'T SHAKE THE FEELING THAT THEY KEPT ASKING UNTIL THEY GOT THERE. AND SO WE HAVE SPENT $750,000 SO FAR ON THIS, AND WE CLAIM WE HAVE GRIT FEEDS IN THE CITY. WE HAVE NEEDS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUT WE SPEND IT TO KILL DEER AND WE HAVE NEEDS FOR CLIMATE ACTION AND SOME OF THIS -- THE STUDIES SHOW THAT SOME OF THIS OVERLAPS THAT AND THESE ARE VERY REAL NEEDS WE HAVE. I WAS HOPING TO KEEP IT FROM TOPPING THE $1 MILLION MARK BY REMOVING  THIS FUNDING. THE IDEA THAT IT WAS QUESTIONED BY A SPEAKER EARLIER THAT WHAT IS THE MORAL DILEMMA? IF YOU CAN'T GUESS WHAT THE MORAL DILEMMA IS, WE ARE SENDING PEOPLE INTO OUR PARKS WITH GUNS AND MANY PEOPLE ARE OPPOSED TO THAT AND MANY PEOPLE ARE OPPOSED WITH KILLING AND WOULD LIKE TO FIND A WAY TO LIVE WITH OUR SEMIDESTRUCTIVE NEIGHBORS. AND DEER ARE DOING WHAT DEER DO AND WE ARE AB PUTTING PEOPLE OVR DEER. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE DYING PARKS AND WOODLANDS WE DON'T MENTION THE SAME CONCERNS FOR THE DYING PARKS AND LANDS WHEN WE DENUDE 34 ACRES TO PUT IN A HOUSING DEVELOPMENT OR THE 34 ACRES SOUTH OF IT TO PUT IN A STUDENT HOUSING VERY MANIMENT. THERE'S -- HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. THERE'S NEVER ANY CONVERSATION AROUND THE CHANGES WE ARE MAKING TO OUR LANDSCAPE THAT ARE PUTTING US IN INCREASED CONFLICT WITH OUR FURRY FRIENDS. AND SO THAT WHY'S WHY I BROUGHT THAT FORWARD. TONIGHT IS THE NOT THE NIGHT TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION, NECESSARILY, BUT I -- I FEEL LIKE IT HAS NOT FULLY BEEN HAD AND THIS IS NOT SPRINGING ANYTHING ON ANYONE. I DIDN'T REACH OUT TO ANYBODY TO HYPE UP PEOPLE TO COME DOWN AND SPEAK FOR OR AGAINST IT. I FELT LIKE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY WAS PASSING BY FOR ME NOT TO SAY SOMETHING. I THINK THE QUARTER OF A MILLION DOLLARS THAT WE COMMITTED TO THIS FOR THE NEXT YEAR MAY OR MAY NOT BE NECESSARY BUT I FIND IT TO NOT BE. AND I'M LIVING WITH THE DEER. I HAVE OAK SEEDLING IN MY YARD. I CAN'T KEEP UP WITH PULLING THEM OUT AND I HAVE DEER. I HAVE PHOTOGRAPHS OF DEER COMING DOWN MY SHARED DRIVEWAY, AND SO IT'S WORKING FOR ME OKAY. AND I KNOW THERE ARE PEOPLE ON THE FRINGES AND IN THE RIVER VALLEYS AND AREAS THAT USED TO BE WOODED AND ARE PUSHED TO URBANIZE OUR CITY AND HAS CREATED -- NOT ONLY HAS IT PUSHED OUT THE NATURAL AREAS THAT THESE DEER CALLED THEIR HOMES FOR I MILLENNIA, BUT IT CREATED THE IN YOU FRINGE AREAS THAT THEY PREFER. SO UNTIL WE HAVE A FULL CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT OUR DEVELOPMENT IS DOING TO OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE BIODIVERSITY, I'M GOING TO ASK THAT WE REMOVE THE FUNDING FOR THE DEER CULL. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT.
05:36:17.428: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
05:36:20.231: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, MAYOR TAYLOR. I HAVE A QUESTION IF STAFF COULD RESPOND. I'M NOT SURE IF THEY HAVE THE ANSWERS BUT THANK YOU, MR. DELLACOURT.
05:36:37.849: >> I WILL DO MY BEST.
05:36:38.817: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANKS FOR STAYING UP THIS LATE HOUR AND STILL LOOKING SHARP. [ LAUGHTER ] WE'RE IN THE FOURTH YEAR; IS THAT CORRECT OF THIS?
05:36:48.627: >> YES, WE COMPLETED FOUR YEARS TO DATE.
05:36:52.531: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: COMPLETED FOUR YEARS. WAS IT A PART OF FIVE YEAR OR TEN YEAR PLAN OR WHERE ARE WE CURRENTLY IN THE TIMELINE WITH WHAT WE STARTED OFF AS HAVING, WAS IT A FIVE-YEAR PLAN OR --
05:37:09.881: >> WELL, IT STARTED BEFORE I GOT HERE. I THINK IT STARTED WITH A FOUR-YEAR RESOLUTION FOR COUNCIL FOR ACTION, FOUR YEARS. THAT RESOLUTION WAS LATER AMENDED TO INCLUDE STERILIZATION. WHEN THAT WAS DONE, WE ENTERED -- OR WE RECEIVED A FIVE-YEAR PERMIT FROM THE DNR TO DO RESEARCH PERMIT TO DO STERILIZATION AND LETHAL CULLING. SO WE ARE IN THE FOUR-YEARS OF THAT RESEARCH PERMIT AND WE HAVE ONE YEAR LEFT.
05:37:38.643: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: AND WE ARE CLOSE TO MEETING THE LIMIT ON THATER THE PERMIT HAD A SET NUMBER?
05:37:44.212: >> FOR STERILIZATION, YES.
05:37:45.947: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: AND SO WE WILL NOT BE STERILIZING ANY MORE DEER?
05:37:49.184: >> YES, IT'S NOT COST EFFECTIVE IN THE NEXT YEAR. THERE WAS A HARD CAP OF 80 PUT ON BY THE DNR WHEN WE STARTED. WE'RE AT 78. IT'S JUST NOT COST EFFECTIVE TO MOBILIZE TO STERILIZE TWO MORE DEER.
05:38:03.798: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: NOW, IF WE WERE TO DEFEND THE PROGRAM, HOW WOULD THAT IMPACT -- DEFUND THE PROGRAM, HOW WOULD THAT IMPACT OUR GOALS THAT WE STARTED WITH? ARE WE ENDING IT ONE YEAR TOO SOON? ARE AWE AT A POINT, A FLESH THRD THAT WOULD COMPROMISE THE EFFORTS UP TO THIS POINT?
05:38:24.719: >> THAT'S A DIFFICULT QUESTION FOR ME TO ANSWER. I'M NOT AN EXPERT IN THIS MATTER AT ANY MEASURE, BUT I THINK THERE'S A S  NIFICANT EFFORT PUT INTO IT TO THIS DATE. THE GOALS, WHEN IT COMES TO DEER MANAGEMENT, I LEARNED OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST FEW YEARS ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO QUANTIFY. IT'S A COMMUNITY TOLERANCE ISSUE IS HOW IT'S BEST DESCRIBED TO ME AND STAFF, AS WE WORKED ON THIS. WE SET OUT AT THE BEGINNING AND TRIED TO PUT TOGETHER A BROAD SECTOR OF THE COMMUNITY VISION OR TOLERANCE FOR THE DEER HERD IN THE COMMUNITY AND THAT'S WHY YOU SEE SO MANY DIFFERENT GOALS, INCLUDING SURVEY WORK THAT HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED. CERTAINLY, IF THE PROGRAM WERE TO END NOW, THE POPULATION OF THE DEER WOULD CONTINUE TO EXPAND. WHAT THAT DID TO SOME OF THE MEASURABLES WE HAVE, DEER CAR CRASHES, IMPACT TO NEIGHBORHOODS, IMPACT TO AND BROWSE DAMAGE TO OUR NATURAL AREAS I'M CERTAINLY SURE THAT WE WOULD SEE AN INCREASE AT LEAST THE TREND TOWARDS A REDUCTION IN IT WOULD STOP. SO IT WOULD HAVE AN IMPACT. THERE'S NO QUESTION.
05:39:31.583: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: AND DO WE HAVE ANY TARGETED GOALS FOR THE UPCOMING YEAR AS SO HOW MANY DEER WE'RE TARGETING?
05:39:41.827: >> NO, NOT THIS YEAR. WE HAVEN'T GOT ON THAT FAR IN THE PROCESS YET.
05:39:45.764: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: OKAY. THAT'S ALL FOR NOW. THANK YOU.
05:39:50.101: >> Councilmember Hayner:  CAN I Q&A WHILE HE'S THERE (.
05:39:54.038: >> YOU ARE LOOKING SHARP TONIGHT.
05:40:00.011: >> IT MAKES ME WONDER HOW I LOOK FORMALLY.
05:40:03.814: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANKS FOR HANGING IN THERE. A CONCERN I DIDN'T MENTION IN MY P PROLOGUE. ARE WE SURE THAT WE SELECTED THE RIGHT VENDOR FOR THIS. IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S A LOT OF VOLUNTEER EFFORT IN HELPING THEM OUT AND THERE WAS NO COMMENSURATE REDUCTION IN BILLING?
05:40:30.174: >> YES, I HAVE BEEN PART OF THAT DISCUSSION AS WELL. THE TO ANSWER THE FIRST PART OF WHY YOU ARE QUESTION, I HAVE NO QUESTION WE ARE USING THE RIGHT VENDOR FOR THIS. WE ARE THE ONLY ONE THAT WE ARE AWARE OF THAT ARE A NONPROFIT THAT DOES THIS. THEY HAVE BEEN EXTRAORDINARILY SAFE WITH US AND DELIVERED EXACTLY WHAT WE ASKED FOR. SO THE FIRST PART OF THE QUESTION IS EASY. THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE VOLUNTEERS WHO HAVE HELPED THEM OUT AND WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THAT SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT BE REFLECTED IN THE BILLING IS SOMETHING I DON'T HAVE EXACT NUMBERS FOR. I NO HE WHAT THEY HAVE BILLED US FOR, THEY HAVE PROVIDED THE EXACT SERVICE THEY SAID THEY WOULD PROVIDE. HOW UTILIZED VOLUNTEERS IN THE FEEL, I COULDN'T QUANTIFY THAT WITHOUT DOING SOME RESEARCH IN THE FIELD.
05:41:12.951: >> Councilmember Hayner:  SO WOULD YOU CONSIDER THAT THIS IS WITH THE REDUCTION IN THE ANNUAL COST -- IS THAT THE IDEA THAT THIS IS MOVING AS PROMISED TOO SOME TYPE OF MAINTENANCE DO YOU BELIEVE? WOULD THAT BE YOUR SPECULATION?
05:41:28.466: >> I WOULD CERTAIN LeHOPE SO. I MEAN WE -- I WOULD CERTAINLY HOPE SO. I MEAN WE STILL HAVE POCKETS WHERE WE HAVE POPULATION OF DEER THAT WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET TO AS PART OF THE PROGRAM WHERE WE SEE CORRELATIONS OR AT LEAST HIGHER DEER-VEHICLE CRASHES IN THOSE AREAS. SO THERE ARE SOME AREAS THAT PROBABLY AREN'T IN THAT SPACE BUT WE BELIEVE A GOOD PORTION OF THE WARDS ONE AND TWO, WHERE WE WORKED WOULD BE CLOSER WHO WHAT WE WOULD CONSIDER MAINTENANCE THAN THE TYPE OF OPERATIONS OVER THE LAST THREE OR FOUR YEARS.
05:42:01.199: >> Councilmember Hayner:  AND HAVE YOU BEEN REACHING OUT TO THE SURROUNDING TOWNSHIPS AND ORGANIZATIONS TO PLAY THEIR PART? IT'S SORT OF A KNOWLEDGE THAT ACCORDING TO MY CARPENTER/BOW HUNTER THAT DEER HAVE SIX-MILE LOOPS THAT THEY RUN.
05:42:15.313: >> YES, WE HAVE EVERY YEAR CAULTALKED TO NEIGHBORING TOWNSS WHERE WE ARE GOING TO BE ACTIVE TO DISCUSS THEIR WILLINGNESS.
05:42:25.656: >>>> Councilmember Hayner:  SO WE ARE TAKING ON THE BURDEN OF ADDITIONAL EXPOSURE, YOU MIGHT SAY TO THESE HERDS?
05:42:33.398: >> I DON'T KNOW IF ANNEXING THEM OR NOT INCREASES --
05:42:38.936: >> Councilmember Hayner:  OUR RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT.
05:42:40.604: >> THEY ARE IN THOSE AREAS. THE ISLANDS ARE SURROUNDED BY CITY PARCELS. THEY MOVE ON AND OFF OF THOSE TOWNSHIP ISLANDS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IMPACT THE ANNEXING ACTUALLY HAS ON WHAT WE WOULD NEED TO BE DO TO BE EFFECTIVE IN THAT AREA.
05:42:56.054: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU.
05:42:58.489: >> Mayor Taylor: QUESTIONS? COUNCILMEMBER EATON?
05:42:59.957: >> Councilmember Eaton: I DON'T WANT YOU TO WANDER AWAY.
05:43:01.759: >> THAT'S OKAY. I KEEP TRYING TO GET AWAY.
05:43:04.362: >> Councilmember Eaton: SO THIS AMOUNT IN THE BUDGET IS REALLY KIND OF A PLACEHOLDER UNTIL WE DEVELOP A FULL-FLEDGED PLAN THIS SUMMER.
05:43:18.676: >> YES, IT'S KNOWING WHAT WE WON'T BE ABLE TO DO WITH STERILIZATION OFF THE TABLE. IT'S A REASONABLE PLACE HOLDER BUT IT HAS NOT BEEN DIVIDED BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT SUBCATEGORIES WE DIVIDE THE MANY ON TO AT THIS POINT.
05:43:31.422: >> Councilmember Eaton: CAN YOU GIVE ME A GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE AREAS WE DO FUND?
05:43:34.559: >> WE DO A LOT WITH DATA COLLECTION, OBVIOUSLY, HELICOPTER SURVEYS AND THE SURVEY THROUGH MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY WHICH WE PAY FOR A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT SURVEY EVERY YEAR. WE FIGURE IF WE ARE GOING TO HAVE THAT AS A MEASURABLE, THAT THAT IS APPROPRIATE. WE DO SURVEY WORK AND THE HELICOPTER FLYOVERS AND THEN THE PRODUCE SURVEYS AND THE OTHER TWO AREAS ARE LETHAL CULLING AND UP UNTIL THIS YEAR THE STERILIZATION.
05:44:00.985: >> Councilmember Eaton: OKAY. AND SO AT THAT TIME, WHEN WE WORK OUT THOSE DETAILS, IT WOULD COME BACK TO COUNCIL TO ACTUALLY APPROVE   THE CONTRACT FOR THE CULL PORTION?
05:44:09.059: >> WELL, THE CONTRACT HAS ONE-YEAR REMAINING AND FUNDING LEFT IN IT.
05:44:12.997: >> Councilmember Eaton: OH, OKAY.
05:44:13.797: >> SO THAT WOULD NOT NEED TO COME BACK TO COUNCIL AT THIS POINT.
05:44:16.667: >> Councilmember Eaton: THANK YOU.
05:44:19.537: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
05:44:20.438: >> Councilmember Bannister: I HAD ONE MORE QUESTION FOR YOU.
05:44:21.805: >> I SHOULD STOP DOING THAT.
05:44:26.043: >> Councilmember Bannister: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER MENTIONED HOW THE DESTRUCTION OF THE WILDLIFE HABITAT DOESN'T RATE -- WE DON'T CARE ABOUT IT THEN. AND SO I WAS WONDERING HAS YOUR DEPARTMENT EVER CONSIDERED TRACKING THE WILDLIFE THAT'S DISPLACED WHEN THEY ARE -- OR HOW HARD WOULD THAT BE TO ADD THAT INTO THE BUILDING DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, WHERE WE DID AN INVENTORY OF HOW MANY DEER MIGHT HAVE LIVED THIS AND OTHER WILDLIFE?
05:44:58.476: >> I MEAN, I KNOW WE DO WILDLIFE INVENTORY THROUGH NAPA AND PARCELS THAT THE CITY OWNS. YOU WOULD BE ASKING TO DO INVENTORIES ON PRIVATELY HELD PARCELS PRIOR TO DEVELOPMENT?
05:45:13.123: >> YEAH.
05:45:13.391: >> Councilmember Bannister: AS PART OF THE PROCESS, THE CHECK LIST?
05:45:15.226: >> I WOULD HAVE TO LOOK INTO IT. I MEAN, THAT WOULD BE REQUIRING US TO REQUIRE PRIVATE OWNERS TO ALLOW US TO DO INVENTORY WORK ON THEIR PROPERTIES AND I'M NOT SURE OF THE ISSUES THAT WOULD SURROUND THAT.
05:45:27.705: >> Councilmember Bannister: LIKE, WHEN THEY ARE CLEAR CUTTING ALL THE HABITAT TO PUT IN THE --
05:45:32.310: >> I UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION. I JUST DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO EXERCISE THAT KIND OF REQUIREMENT ON PRIVATE PROPERTY.
05:45:39.650: >> Councilmember Hayner:  IF I COULD FOLLOW-UP, MAYBE.
05:45:41.485: >> Councilmember Bannister: SURE. WELL, LET ME JUST SAY ONE LAST THING AND ALSO ALONG THAT LINE, THAT ALSO FOLLOWS WITH, LIKE, LOSS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THAT WOULD BE ANOTHER THING THAT I HAVE HEARD PEOPLE SUGGEST WE TRACK. THAT BEFORE WE BUILD UP A NEW LUXURY WHATNOT, WE TRACK HOW MUCH     AFFORDABLE HOUSING OR D HOUSING THAT WAS THERE IS GOING AWAY AND WHAT -- WHAT WILDLIFE WERE THERE.
05:46:11.782: >> OKAY.
05:46:12.049: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I THINK COUNCILWOMAN BANNISTER IS SPEAKING TO NATURAL CAPITAL WHERE WE PUT A PRICE ON WHAT EXISTS BEFORE WE TEAR DOWN HOUSES AND IS THERE AN OPPORTUNITY IN OUR ZONING CODE AND THE DEVELOPMENT LAWS AND THE BUILDING LAWS TO ASSESS A NEED FOR THE LOST GREEN SPACE?
05:46:30.368: >> AGAIN, I UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION. I WOULD HAVE TO LOOK INTO IT WITH THE CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE TO DETERMINE IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT IS ALLOWABLE. WE DO HAVE ORDINANCES THAT REQUIRE FOR REPLACEMENT OF TREES AND OTHER THINGS. THIS WOULD BE SIMILAR TO THAT. THEY ARE BASED ON -- I KNOW WE TALKED IN THE PAST ABOUT ENABLING LEGISLATION AND WHAT THAT DOES FOR ZONING BUT I WOULD HAVE TO TALK WITH THE CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE TO SEE IF WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO MAKE THOSE KIND OF CHANGES TO OUR ZONING. CERTAINLY NOT IMPOSSIBLE. IT'S A MATTER IF IT'S ALLOWABLE.
05:47:01.331: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
05:47:02.499: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. JUST ONE QUICK QUESTION. I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND COUNCILMEMBER EATON'S QUESTION WHEN IT COMES BACK TO US AND KNOWING THAT THIS CONTRACT, WE ARE UNDER CONTRACT FOR ANOTHER YEAR SO I'M NOT SURE IF SUPPORTING THIS WOULD BE A WISE ENDEAVOR. BUT MY USE OF -- MY QUESTION IS ABOUT THE FIREARMS AND THE DISCHARGE OF THE FIREARMS, AND I KNOW THERE WERE SOME LEGAL RESTRICTIONS THAT WERE, YOU KNOW, AMENDED OF SORTS. I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IF MR. LAZARUS EXPLAIN WHAT WAS CHANGED TO ALLOW THIS CULL TO HAPPEN IN CLOSE PROXIMITY -- MAYBE COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER KNOWS THE CHANCE. I KNOW WE CHANGED HOW --
05:48:03.894: >> Councilmember Hayner:  WE CHANGED THE FIREARM LAWS FOR DNR USES. SO IT'S UNABLE TO DISCHARGE A FIREARM CITY LIMBS UNLESS SOMEONE IS OPERATING IN THE NR HARVESTING PERMIT. ESSENTIALLY.
05:48:21.144: >> THERE'S TWO OR THREE DIFFERENT THINGS WITH FIREARMS DISCHARGED IN THE CITY. ONE IS THE AMENDMENTS TO THE DISCHARGE OF FIREARMS TO THE CULLING OPERATIONS. TWO YEARS AGO THERE WAS SOME CLARIFICATION NEEDED ON THE DNR ON A 400-FOOT PRERESTRICTIONS AND THE DR CHANGED IT. THE DNR CHANGED IT BECAUSE IT WAS POORLY WORDED IN THEIR MINDS. IT WAS NOT INTENDED TO APPLY TO CULLING. IT WAS' HUNTING RESTRICTION. SO THEY CLARIFIED THAT IT DIDN'T -- THAT IT WAS NOT INTENDED OR SHOULDN'T ILL PACK LETHAL CULLING AND THEN AN OUTSTANDING QUESTION THAT WAS FINALLY RESOLVED LAST QUEER, ABOUT THE ABILITY TO SHOOT WITHIN 1,000 FEET OF A PUBLIC SCHOOL. REGULATION, IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY. SO ALL OF THOSE -- AND THAT WAS JUST A CLARIFICATION.
05:49:08.959: >> Councilmember Hayner: OKAY.
05:49:09.692: >> THAT WAS NOT A CHANGE THAT ANYBODY MADE. THOSE WERE THE THREE THAT WERE -- THAT IMPACTED WHERE AND HOW WE SHOOT.
05:49:15.899: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: SHOOT? OKAY. THANK YOU.
05:49:19.403: >> YEP.
05:49:19.903: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION.
05:49:23.840: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
05:49:24.841: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU FOR ALL OF YOUR WORK ON THIS. I APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP. AND YOU HAVE BEEN AT THIS FOR A WHILE. WE ARE NOW -- WE EMBARKED ON THIS FOUR YEARS AGO. BECAUSE YOUR POPULATION HAD BECOME A SERIOUS PROBLEM, AND AT THE TIME, WE SUSPECTED THAT OVER POPULATION WAS CAUSING SERIOUS DAMAGE TO OUR PARKS AND NATURE AREAS AND RESULTING IN MORE DEER-VEHICLE COLLISIONS AND CAUSING DAMAGE TO PRIVATE PROPERTY. SO WE EMBARKED ON THIS PROGRAM THAT'S BEEN REFINED OVER THE FOUR YEARS. IT'S A DATA-DRIVEN PROGRAM GUIDED BY MET TREKS AND MEASURE -- METRICS AND MEASURES OF SUCCESS, DRIVEN BY WHITE BUFFALO AND DR. CORTO. AND THE U OF M JOINED OUR EFFORT BECAUSE THE UNIVERSITY RECOGNIZED THE PROBLEM AND THE POTENTIAL ADVERSE IMPACTS AS WELL. WE COLLECTED DATA THAT CLEARLY DEMONSTRATES THE ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE TO OUR PARKS AND NATURE AREAS. AND I COMMEND EVERYONE TO READ DR. CORTO'S REPORT ON DAMAGE ON OAK SEEDLINGS WHICH FOUND THAT BROWSE DAMAGE ALL NINE PARKS AND NATURE AREAS EXCEEDED THE 15 TO 30% LEVEL THAT PLACES FOREST REGENERATION AT RISK. IN SEVEN OF THE NINE AREAS THE BROWSE DAMAGE WAS AT OVER 50% AND FOUR OF THE NINE OVER 70%. DEER-VEHICLE COLLISIONS HAVE DOUBLED OVER HISTORICAL LEVELS OF 30 OR SO A YEAR. AND THEY PEAKED IN 2015 AT 90 COLLISIONS. SO WE NEED TO BE CLEAR, THERE'S NO DEBATING THE ACED VERSE IMPACTS OF DEER OVER POPULATION. THEY ARE REAL AND PARTICULARLY THE ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE ON OUR PUBLIC PARKS AND WE HAVE THE DATA THAT CLEARLY DEMONSTRATES IT. DEER POPULATIONS DOUBLE EVERY TWO TO THREE YEARS IN THE ABSENCE OF ACTION. CALENDAR I WOULD SAY THAT WE ALL RECEIVED A LETTER FROM PROFESSOR CHRISTOPHER DICK, A BIOLOGY PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AND HE SHARED WITH US, INFORMATION ABOUT THE U OF M'S EXPERIENCE, HE'S BEEN INVOLVED WITH LETHAL DEER MANAGEMENT AS DIRECTOR OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN'S E.S. CHARGE RESERVE AND EXPLAINS THE -- HOW DEER REPRODUCE EXPONENTIALLY AND WHAT THEY FOUND IN THEIR EXPERIENCE, AND WHY THEY DO PERIODIC CULLS AND REDUCING THE SPREAD OF DEER DISEASE AND THEN HE LISTS THE DISEASES THAT HAVE DECIMATED DEER POPULATIONS IN AND AROUND LANSING. ANY WAY, IT'S A LETTER FROM SOMEONE WHO HAS A LOT OF EXPERIEXPERIENCE IN THIS FIELD. SO ASSUMING THAT WE ARE NOT GOING TO NO ONE WANTS TO LET YOU ARE PARKS AND NATURE AND AREAS BEING DECIMATED. THE THOUGHT OF STARTING ALL OVER AGAIN AT SOME POINT AND SPENDING MORE MONEY OVER TIME, WHICH IS THE REALITY IF WE DON'T MAINTAIN THE PROBLEM. WHITE BUFFALO SAYS WE ARE CLOSE TO MAINTENANCE LEVEL IN THE PROGRAM AND THE $150,000 PROPOSED BUDGET REFLECTS THAT. IT IS SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN WHAT WE SPENT IN PREVIOUS YEARS, AND IT'S -- AND AS WE KNOW AN EVEN SMALLER AMOUNT OF $100,000 IS PLANNED FOR FISCAL YEAR 20/21. SO OBVIOUSLY, TO NO ONE'S SURPRISE, I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING THIS TONIGHT AND I ENCOURAGE MY COLLEAGUES TO OPPOSE IT AS WELL. I THINK THAT ABANDONING THE PROGRAM NOW JUST AT THE TIME THAT WE ARE CLOSE TO MAINTENANCE LEVELS JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE AND IT'S A SHORT-TERM RELIEF THE PRESSURE KIND OF DECISION WITH POTENTIALLY SERIOUS LONG-TERM ENVIRONMENTAL AND FISCAL CONSEQUENCES AND I THINK IT IS -- IT WOULD ALSO BE A DECISION THAT WOULD IN HE GATE THE GOOD PROGRESS THAT -- NEGATE THE GOOD PROGRESS WE HAVE MADE TO DATE AND QUITE LIKELY AND HONESTLY, WE'LL RESULT AND REQUIRE US STARTING OVER AGAIN IN JUST A FEW YEARS TIME, FACING A MUCH LARGER PROBLEM, AND THAT MAKES NO SENSE AND ALSO DONE THINK THERE'S GOOD POLICY. SO I WON'T BE SUPPORTING THE AMENDMENT AND I JUST THINK THAT, AGAIN, TO ABANDON THE DEER MANAGEMENT TIME AT THIS POINT IN TIME WHEN WE ARE CLOSE TO MANAGEMENT LEVELS.
05:54:30.512: >> Councilmember Griswold: CALL THE QUESTION!
05:54:36.018: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
05:54:44.660: >> Councilmember Eaton: NO.
05:54:45.261: >> Councilmember Nelson:  NO.
05:54:46.863: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: NO.
05:54:49.198: >> Councilmember Hayner: YES.

05:54:59.909: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
05:55:00.409: >> Clerk Beaudry: THE MOTION FAILS.
05:55:05.782: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION.
05:55:06.783: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE AMENDMENT 7.
05:55:11.020: >> Mayor Taylor: SECONDED BY COUNCICOUNCILMEMBER EATON.
05:55:15.158: >> Councilmember Hayner: AMENDMENT 7 IS TO INCREASE THE RECURRING ANNUAL CONTRIBUTION TO FUNDPENSION LIABILITY, ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR PENSION LIABILITY FOR FISCAL YEAR 2020 FROM ALL NEW SOURCES OF REVENUE, I WILL READ THE THREE WHEREAS CLASSES AND THEN WE'LL GET INTO IT. WHEREAS IT IS CUSTOMARY THAT NEW SOURCES OF UNRESTRICTED REVENUE AND INCREASES IN UNRESTRICTED REVENUE FROM EXISTING SOURCES CONTRIBUTE TOWARDS REDUCING PENSION FUN LIABILITY; AND WHEREAS THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH MILLAGE REVENUE IS NEW, RECURRING REVENUE, DESIGNATED FOR NEW PROGRAMS AND SUPPORTED BY PERSONNEL IN THE GENERAL FUND IN THE AMOUNT OF $2,200,000, FURPHIES Y'ALL YEAR 2020 AND F.Y.2021 AND WHEREAS IT IS FACIALLY RESPONSIBLE TO GIVE FIRST CALL TO NEW REVENUE TO INCREASE CONTRIBUTIONS TO PENSION LIABILITIES IN YEARS AND POSITIVE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS; THEREFORE CREATING LONG-TERM FINANCIAL CTA BILL DIAND REDUCING THE STRUCTURAL DEFICIT. I WON'T GO TO THE RESOLVE CLAUSES. WE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH REVENUE, WHERE WE CREATED A DEP AN WE HAVE STAFFED THAT DEPARTMENT, AND THE FUNDING FOR THAT DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN COMING FROM THE GENERAL FUND AND THE PENSION LIABILITY THAT THESE NEW EMPLOYEES ARE ADDING TO IS COMING FROM THE GENERAL FUND. AND THE STRUCTURAL DEFICIT IS PARTLY A RESULT OF OUR UNDERFUNDING THE PENSION LIABILITIES. THESE ARE NEW FUND DOLLARS AND THEY SHOULD PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE. NOW, THAT BEING SAID, I RECOGNIZE THE OBSESSION THAT SOME ON THIS BODY HAVE WITH LEAVING THOSE DOLLARS UNTOUCHED AND THEY HAVE BEEN PUT IN THEIR OWN FUND NUMBER FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES WE ARE TOLD. AND YET THIS SORT OF -- THERE'S AN ACCOUNTING SHUFFLE GOING ON, WHERE THIS $2.2 MILLION EACH YEAR, IS FUNDING THE PROGRAMS BUT NOT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING THE PROGRAMS. IS THAT ACCURATE? AND SO WHO IS PICKING UP THE BILL FOR THAT? WELL, WE ARE ALL ARE. FROM OUR GENERAL FUND. AND YELTSIN OUR CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, MR. CRAWFORD HAS HAD THE FORESIGHT TO USE SOME OF THE EXCESS MONIES WE HAD THIS YEAR TO ADD HALF MILLION DOLLARS TO THE PAYMENTS OF THE THIS LIABILITY, AND WHICH IS A-OKAY IN MY BOOK. I HOPE TO PRESS FORWARD IN CHANGING THE REQUIREMENTS AROUND THE PENSION MANDATES AND ESPECIALLY THE BENEFITS AS WE LOOK AT POTENTIALLY HUNDREDS OF NEW HIRES. NOW IS THE TIME FOR US TO ACT AS A BODY TO FIX THESE STRUCTURAL DEFICITS. AND ALL THAT BEING SAID, I WANTED TO BRING THIS KIND OF BOOKKEEPING MUMBO JUMBO TO THE FRONT BUT I WILL WITHDRAW THIS AMENDMENT BECAUSE OF THE SEVERE ATTACHMENT PEOPLE HAVE TO THIS MONEY BEING SPENT IN A 40/40/20 WAY. SO I WITHDRAW AMENDMENT 7 IF IT'S AMENABLE WITH MY COSPONSOR, COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
05:58:35.024: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
05:58:35.858: >> Councilmember Eaton: I WANTED TO THANK COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. WE HAVE $78 MILLION UNFUNDED LIABILITY FOR OUR PENSION FUND, WHICH WILL INCREASE IN FISCAL YEAR 20/21 TO $82 MILLION. I THINK WE NEED TO HOOK AT WAYS TO -- TO LOOK AT WAYS TO TRY TO ADD MORE TO OUR CONTRIBUTION TO THESE FUNDS, BUT I AGREE WITH COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER THAT THIS IS PROBABLY NOT THE TIME OR THE WAY TO DO IT. SO I WOULD AGREE TO WITHDRAW THIS AMENDMENT.
05:59:10.359: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THAT FRIENDLY TO THE BODY. THANK YOU. WOULD SOMEONE BE SO KIND TO ADDRESS NUMBER NINE?
05:59:20.702: >> EIGHT.
05:59:21.003: >> Mayor Taylor: PARDON ME, EIGHT. I WAS IMAGINING A HAPPIER DAY. COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
05:59:33.049: >> Councilmember Nelson: AMENDMENT 8 IS MINE. I HAVE TO MOVE IT? OH, BEING I HAVEN'T EVEN BEEN LISTENING TO HOW THESE HAVE BEEN MOVED. I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE AMENDMENT 8.
05:59:41.290: >> Mayor Taylor: YOU HAVE A SECOND, COUNCILMEMBER EATON. COUNCILMEMBER NELSON, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
05:59:52.334: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I'M NOT MOVING MONEY FROM ONE PART OF THE BUDGET TO ANOTHER PART OF THE BUDGET. I'M SHIFTING IT FORWARD. SO ORIGINALLY THIS ASP ASPHALT H WOULD HAVE BEEN IN 2021 AND I'M ASKING THAT WE PUT IT INTO 2020, THE SAME YEAR THAT WE ARE ALREADY PLANNING ON DOING SOUTH MAIN. AND IT'S -- IT IS DEPLETING THE BUDGET FOR 2021. IT MEANS THAT WE HAVE NOW FRONT LOADED IT ALL TO THE SAME YEAR, BUT MY REASON FOR PRIORITIZING THIS IS THAT THE RESIDENTS ON WEST OAK BROOK HAVE BEEN WAITING A REALLY LONG TIME AND I FEEL LIKE THAT THAT LOCATION IS SORT OF A UNIQUE STATE OF NEED BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY ELDERLY PEOPLE WOULD LIVE THERE. AND THERE'S ANOTHER PIECE OF THIS, WHICH IS THAT I GUESS STAFF WAS LOOKING AT WEST OAK BOAKBROOK AS A FAIRLY DRASTIC CHANGE IN TERMS OF ELIMINATING THE ASPHALT PATHS AND SWITCHING TO SIDEWALKS AND PUTTING BIKE LANES ON THE ROAD, AND FOR THIS PARTICULAR LOCATION, I -- I -- WELL, FIRST OF ALL, THAT WOULD PUSH THINGS FORWARD. THE QUICKEST THING TO DO AS I UNDERSTAND IT, IS TO REPAIR AND FIX THE ASPHALT PATHS AND JUST AS A CYCLIST, I MEAN, THIS IS A LOCATION WHERE THOSE ASPHALT PATHS MAKE A LOT MORE SENSE THAN BIKE LANES ON THE ROAD. CYCLISTS ARE SAFER WHEN THEY ARE FURTHER AWAY FROM THE CARS AND THIS IS A IF PLACE FOR MULTMULTIMODAL PATHS. THAT'S MY AMENDMENT.
06:01:27.162: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
06:01:28.030: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I HAVE A QUESTION ON THE LAST RESOLVE CLAUSE. MAYBE IT'S THE 40 THE HOUR, BUTM HAVING A HARD TIME UNDERSTANDING THE SOURCE OF THE MONEY. WE ARE SAYING FUND BUDGET TO BE INCREASED BY $300,000. IF I CAN GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE SHUFFLE, THE MONEY SHUFFLE.
06:01:54.756: >> Mayor Taylor: IS STAFF AVAILABLE FOR THE QUESTION.
06:01:57.392: >> I MAY HAVE MORE TO COME UP IF YOU HAVE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. WHAT THIS IS DOING IS ADVANCING MONIES AS COUNCILMEMBER NELSON SAID AND SINCE THAT MONEY HAS NOT BEEN COLLECTED IN FISCAL '21, WE ARE PUTTING OUT OF THE FUND BALANCE IN '20 AND IT GETS COLLECTED IN '21.
06:02:19.214: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  MY OTHER QUESTION, IS WHAT OTHER PROJECTS WILL BE MOVED AROUND IN ORDER FOR THIS TO BE COMPLETED? I KNOW IT'S KIND OF HARD TO SAY. THERE AB PR'S PROBABLY MANY BUTM SOME OTHER PROJECTS. A COST T
06:02:40.135: >> WHAT IS BEING PROPOSED HERE IS TO MOVE IT UP FROM 2021, AND SO THERE'S NOT ANY LOSS. WE WOULD DO IT ONE YEAR EARLIER THAN WE HAD INTENDED TO DO IT ANYWAY. SO --
06:02:58.453: >> DRAM DID WE LOOK AT OTHER PROJECTS IN TERM OF -- IF WE KNEW THAT, YOU KNOW, IT WAS OPEN FOR, KNOW, CHANGES, PERHAPS OTHER MEMBERS AND OTHER PARTS OF THE CITY WOULD WANT A LITTLE BIT OF PORK BELLY COMING BACK TO THEIR WARD WITH ALL DUE RESPECT. IT'S NOT PORK BELLY, BUT WE ALL HAVE A LOT WISHES IN EACH OF OUR WARDS AND THIS' A LOT OF FAILING PATHS AND JUST -- YOU KNOW, IT SEEMS -- YOU KNOW, IT SEEMS A LITTLE ODD FOR THIS TO BE IN THIS PART OF THE BUDGET.
06:03:38.426: >> WE HAVE DONE -- WE HAVE DONE A CONDITION ANALYSIS IN PRIORITIZATION. OUR ASPHALT PATHS THROUGHOUT THE CITY AND WE -- WE PROGRAMMED SOME PORTION OF THE STREET MILLAGE EX-Y EACH YEAR TO ASPHALT PATH RESURFACE. THE WAY WE LAID IT OUT ON OUR PRIORITY, WE HAD A PIECE OF THE SOUTH MAIN PATH, YOU KNOW, BETWEEN, SAY ANN ARBOR AND EISENHAUER AND THEN THIS PROJECT WAS SCHEDULED FOR '21, JUST BASED ON OUR SEASON ANALYSIS AND PRIORITIES THAT -- THAT WE ANALYZED.
06:04:22.704: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
06:04:23.738: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WANTED TO THANK STAFF AND ADMINISTRATION FOR WHAT I -- WHEN I WENT INTO THIS BUDGET PROJECT, I HAD A LIST OF THINGS THAT PEOPLE WANTED, RESIDENTS ASKED ME TO TRY TO GET AND NOT GET. AND WE HAD A SIMILAR SITUATION IN WARD ONE TO CUT TO THE CHASE AND IT WAS LAIRD DRIVE WHICH IS A PATH OF GREAT USE AND MERELY MENTIONING IT BROUGHT IT BACK TO THE TOP, AND THEY WENT OUT THERE AND CLEARED SOME BRUSH AND PEOPLE ARE USING IT NOW. EVERYBODY IS HAPPY. I WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR THAT AND I ENCOURAGE COUNCILMEMBERS TO BRING THESE THINGS FORWARD AND I CERTAINLY SUPPORT THIS BECAUSE OF THE WAY IT'S NOT TAKING FROM ANYTHING AND OAK BROOK IS A WELL-USED AREA. A LOT OF SENIORS OUT THERE AND I THINK IT'S GREAT AND I THANK YOU BRINGING THIS FORWARD.
06:05:10.051: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. ALL IN FAVOR. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED.
06:05:22.230: >> Mayor Taylor: WOULD SOMEONE BE A PAL OPEN NUMBER 9. DID I HEAR YOU SAY MOVE AMENDMENT 9.
06:05:30.205: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES. YOU TOOK THE WORDS OUT OF MY MOUTH.
06:05:32.740: >> Mayor Taylor: AND SECONDED BY HAYNER WILL DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED.
06:05:52.394: >> Councilmember Lumm: PARKS FAIRNESS.
06:05:54.495: >> Mayor Taylor: MOVED BY GRAND AND SECONDED BY HAYNER DO. WE HAVE A NUMBER?
06:05:59.067: >> Councilmember Lumm: WE CAN ADD THEIR NAMES AS SPONSOR THEN.
06:06:02.503: >> TWO ITEMS --  WE HAVE A NUMBER THREE  389, $168.
06:06:15.550: >> Mayor Taylor: SO THERE ARE THREE NUMBERS. THE FIRST OF IN THE WHEREAS
06:06:25.493: >> Councilmember Lumm: EXPANDIN G THE BUDGET BY --
06:06:44.712: >> THE FIRST WHEREAS CLAUSE CAN BE STRICKEN.
06:06:47.782: >> Mayor Taylor: THE FIRST WHEREAS CLAUSE.
06:06:49.084: >> WITH THE DOLLAR AMOUNTS?
06:06:52.753: >> I'M NOT SEEING THE DOLLAR AMOUNT THERE.
06:06:55.423: >> Mayor Taylor: THE FOURTH WHEREAS --
06:06:56.858: >> Councilmember Lumm: THE BUM ET CETERA AMENDMENT.
06:06:57.959: >> THE FIRST. THE FIRST WHEREAS CLAUSE CAN BE STRICKEN.
06:07:01.129: >> Mayor Taylor: I WASN'T TALKING ABOUT THAT.
06:07:04.399: >> SORRY.
06:07:04.699: >> Mayor Taylor: THE FOURTH WE ARE ASKING ABOUT.
06:07:07.335: >> THAT WOULD BE 398.
06:07:10.838: >> Mayor Taylor: 398 EVEN?
06:07:11.772: >> CAN YOU HOLD ON ONE SECOND?
06:07:16.010: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
06:07:23.851: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YOU HAVE TO WAIT AROUND UNTIL 1:15 TO WAX WATCH THE SAUSAGE COME O.
06:07:56.751: >> OKAY. I HAVE BEEN CORRECTED BY THE BRILLIANT ORGANIZATION.
06:08:02.924: >> Mayor Taylor: EXCELLENT.
06:08:03.524: >> THE FOURTH WHEREAS CLAUSE, IS THE ONE THAT CAN BE STRICKEN BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT INCREASED SO THAT CAN BE STRICKEN.
06:08:12.299: >> Mayor Taylor: REALLY?
06:08:12.833: >> THAT OFFSETS.
06:08:13.901: >> Mayor Taylor: OKAY.
06:08:15.402: >> AND ON THE SIXTH WHEREAS CLAUSE, THAT'S THE $389,168 AND THAT WOULD BE THE SAME NUMBER ADDED TO THE RESOLVE CLAUSE.
06:08:33.788: >> Mayor Taylor: ALL RIGHT. COUNCILMEMBER GRAND AND THEN HAYNER, I HEAR YOU MOVING THOSE TWO NUMBERS.
06:08:40.260: >> Councilmember Lumm: AND SPONSORS TOO.
06:08:43.163: >> Mayor Taylor: AND FRIENDLY TO THE BODY.
06:08:44.599: >> Councilmember Hayner: YES, WE HAVE FULL FAITH IN MR. CRAWFORD AND HIS FINE STAFF.
06:08:53.407: >> Mayor Taylor: EXCELLENT. FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE AMENDMENT? I WILL OBSERVE THAT I'M FULLY FOR THIS AMENDMENT, AND THAT IS BECAUSE NOT OF MY OBSESSION WITH DOING WHAT WE SAID WE WOULD DO BUT MY FOCUS ON WHAT WE SAID WE WOULD DO. BROADLY, WE ARE SPENDING AN EXTRA $389,000 BECAUSE COUNCIL IN 2010 AND SUBSEQUENT COUNCILS -- RATHER BECAUSE WE ARE SPENDING THIS MONEY BECAUSE COUNCIL IN 2010 PASSED A RESOLUTION ADOPTING POLICY GUIDANCE FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF PARKS AND CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT MILLAGE. THEY DID SO IN A MANOR THAT CREATES -- A MANNER THAT CREATES A DEBT OF HONOR. THEY PLEDGED TO THE VOTERS THAT WE DO THIS GOING FOR AND VOTERS WOULD HAVE CONFIDENCE AS THEY VOTED ON THE PARKS MAINTENANCE AND THAT THIS WOULD NOT BE A SSHELL GAME AND WE WOULD NOT USE THIS TO OFFSET OTHER GENERAL FUND -- TO OFFSET THE OTHER GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURES. I BELIEVE IN THAT RESOLUTION. I BELIEVE THAT WE ARE ABSOLUTELY DOING THE RIGHT THING TO FOLLOW THAT RESOLUTION, AND I'M DELIGHTED THAT WE ARE DOING IT. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
06:10:09.550: >> Councilmember Hayner: JUST BRIEFLY. OUR PACK MEETS SO MANY. SO IT'S MY SINCERE WISH THAT THIS BE USED NOT ONLY FOR THE KIND OF CAPITAL NEEDS THAT WE HAVE IN PARKS BUT ALSO, YOU NO HE, TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE RESIDENTS' CONCERNS ABOUT PARKS MAINTENANCE ISSUES AND I THINK THIS MIGHT GO A LONG WAY TOWARDS ADDRESSING SOME OF THOSE ISSUES. AND SO IT IS APPRECIATED THAT IT'S REUPPED IN EACH BUDGET CYCLE. THANK YOU ALL.
06:10:40.214: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER
06:10:41.215: >> Councilmember Lumm: OBVIOUSL Y, THIS IS JUST MATH. WHAT WE DO WITH THIS RESOLUTION, EVERY YEAR, BUT I TOO -- YEAH, I THINK THIS IS A VERY GOOD CONCEPT. WE DID NOT DISADVANTAGE PARKS VIS-A-VIS OTHER GENERAL FUNDED AREAS AND I ALREADY OVERHEARD MY COLLEAGUE HERE UNPACK -- I KNOW THERE ARE SO MANY AREAS AND WAYS THAT THIS MONEY COULD BE SPENT, EVERYTHING FROM ICE RINKS TO MAINTENANCE, TO, I KNOW THE LIST IS LONG. SO NICE TO SEE. AND THIS WAS A GOOD CONCEPT, I AGREE, MAYOR TAYLOR.
06:11:23.690: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN MOTION AS AMENDED? COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
06:11:37.704: >> Councilmember Lumm: FIRST OF ALL, I WANT TO THANK MR. CRAWFORD AND MS. LANCASTER FOR ALL OF THEIR SUPPORT DURING THE BUDGET PROCESS AND ALL THE OTHER STAFF WHO ASSISTED WITH ANSWERING A FAIR NUMBER OF QUESTIONS. AND I THINK THE PROCESS OVERALL IS A GOOD ONE. AGAIN, IT'S A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF HELPFUL INFORMATION PROVIDED, EXCELLENT RESPONSIVENESS AT ALL STAGES OF THE PROCESS, UP FRONT, DURING THE WORK SESSIONS, AND, AGAIN, RESPONDING TO QUESTIONS REGARDING THE ADMINISTRATOR'S PROPOSAL AND IN PREPARING FOR TONIGHT'S MEETING. SO THANK YOU FOR ALL OF THAT. I DO THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF POSITIVE ASPECTS TO THIS BUDGET. THE BUDGET RECOGNIZES THAT COMMUNITY PRIORITIES AND PREFERENCES DO MATTER. IT REFLECTS THE COMMUNITY'S SURVEY RESULTS. BY APROVIDING ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR -- BY PROVIDING ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR ISSUES BEYOND 40/40/20 THAT THE RESIDENTS IDENTIFIED, SAFE DRINKING WATER INITIATIVES, ROADS, AND PUBLIC SAFETY. AND IT'S THE PRIORITY-BASED BUDGETING APPROACH. I WORKED HARD TO ENGAGE THE COMMUNITY IN BUDGET AND SPENDING PRIORITIES AND I'M VERY ENCOURAGED TO SEE THAT CITY STAFF VALUE THAT AS WELL. SO THANK YOU FOR THAT. THE BUDGET ADDS RECURRING FUNDING FOR INCREASED CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE MENTION FUND. THAT'S IMPORTANT -- THE PENSION FUND. THAT'S IMPORTANT AND HATS OFF TO MR. CRAWFORD FOR PLANNING ACCORDINGLY. AND BUDGETING ACCORDINGLY, I SHOULD SAY. IT ADDS RECURRING FUNDING FOR THE FIRE STATION MASTER PLAN THAT WAS GOOD OF THE ADMINISTRATOR TO INCORPORATE THAT. IT REFLECTS STRONG FUNDING AND TWO POLICE CADETS AND TWO OFFICERS. I EVERYNEVHE NEVER THOUGHT I WOE THE DAY. THANK YOU FOR SUPPORTING AND IT ALSO REFLECTS THE CONTINUING WITH DEER MANAGEMENT THAT IS APPROPRIATE. SO THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD THINGS IN THIS BUDGET, YOU KNOW. I HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT ADDING ADMINISTRATIVE PERSONNEL AND OVERHEAD. WE ADDED 16 FTEs IN '20 AND WE HAVE ADDED 36 FTEs SINCE '16. THAT'S A LOT. AND I -- YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT A BUDGET-SPECIFIC ISSUE BUT I DO REMAIN VERY CONCERNED THAT WE HAVE A WATER WATER RATE STRUCTUE THAT I THINK FUNDAMENTALLY FLAWED. BUT IN GENERAL, I WANT TO SAY THANKS AND I DO THINK IT WAS A GOOD PROCESS AND THERE'S A LOT OF POSITIVE ELEMENTS IN THIS BUDGET DESERVING OUR SUPPORT. THANKS.
06:14:33.246: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. I WOULD LIKE TO SAY TOO, I WOULD LIKE TO VERY MUCH THANK STAFF OF ALL STRIPES UP AND DOWN THE LINE FROM, YOU KNOW, YESTERDAY'S HIRE TO CITY ADMINISTRATOR LAZARUS. I BELIEVE THAT THIS BUDGET IS SOMETHING THAT WE ALL CAN AND OUGHT BE QUITE EXCITED AND PROUD. THE BUDGET PRIORITIZES BASIC SUSTAINABLE SERVICES BUT ALSO ENSURES THAT WE COMMIT TO QUALITY OF LIFE IMPROVEMENTS, THE SORTS OF IMPROVEMENTS THAT RESIDENTS DEMAND. IT'S TO PROVIDE THE BACSIK SERVICES AND SAFETY, SEWER, STORMWATER, SIDEWALKS, STREETS AND WE ARE DOING THESE THINGS. WE'LL SPEND APPROXIMATELY $182 MILLION ON THESE CORE FUNCTIONS WHICH IS AN INCREASE FROM LAST YEAR. THE BUDGET ALSO DOES WHAT ANN ARBOR RESIDENTS DEMAND THAT WE DO, AND THAT IS TO SAY TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE. WE ARE DOING THAT THROUGH INVESTMENTS, IN PARKS, CLIMATE ACTION, AFFORDABLE HOUSING, AND HUMAN SERVICES AS WELL AS AN INCREASE EMPHASIS AND ONGOING INCREASED EMPHASIS ON NON-VEHICULAR TRANSPORTATION, PEDESTRIANS AND PEDESTRIAN SAFETY. WE ARE MAKING SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENTS UP AND DOWN THE LINE, AND THIS IS SOMETHING, AGAIN, ABOUT WHICH I'M EXCITED AND I THINK RESIDENTS OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT YEAR, VISITORS TO OUR CITY WILL REAP THE BENEFITS OF THE WORK THAT WE HAVE DONE HERE AT THE TABLE AND THE HARD WORK THAT STAFF HAS DONE FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS TO PREPARE FOR IT. SO THANK YOU. FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR OF THE MAIN MOTION AS AMENDED. [CHORUS OF AYES] IT IS APPROVED. TEN MEMBERS ARE PRESENT AND THUS SATISFYING THE SEVEN VOTE REQUIREMENT. OTHER COMMUNICATIONS FROM INDOMITABLE CITY ATTORNEY.
06:16:30.030: >> City Atty. Postema: I DON'T THINK SO.
06:16:30.931: >> Mayor Taylor: AND WE HAVE THE CLERK'S REPORT. MAY I HAVE A MOTION TO APPROVE THE CLERK'S REPORT, MOVED BY HAYNER AND SECONDED BY RAMLAWI. DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. WE HAVE NOW COME TO PUBLIC COMMENT GENERAL TIME. IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO SPEAK TO COUNCIL AND THE COMMUNITY ABOUT MATTERS OF MUNICIPAL ENTER. TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT GENERAL TIME, ONE NEED NOT SIGNED UP IN ADVANCE. SPEAKERS HAVE THREE MINUTES IN WHICH TO SPEAK. AS A MATTER OF COURTESY, WE MAY ONLY HAVE ONE PERSON SPEAKING AT A TIME. IF YOU REQUIRE ASSISTANCE IN SPEAKING BEFORE COUNCIL, WE WOULD PROVIDE IT TO YOU. IS THERE ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT? COME ON UP.
06:17:10.867: >> PHEW! TONIGHT HAS BEEN AMAZING! I AM REALLY APPRECIATING THIS CHAMBER AS A TRUE FORUM FOR THOUGHTFUL DEBATE, AND RESPONSIBLE DISAGREEMENT. I WANT TO THANK YOU NOR REALLY GIVING ME MY OPINION'S -- FOR REALLY GIVING ME MY MONEY'S WORTH FOR THE DIFFERING VIEW POINTS, HOW YOU VOTED AND CHALLENGED EACH OTHER AND HOW YOU INTRODUCED NEW THINKING. NOW IT'S MY RESPONSIBILITY TO LET YOU KNOW WHERE I SEE A PROCESS THAT NEEDS IMPROVEMENT. I'M HERE BECAUSE I BELIEVE PEOPLE AND SYSTEMS CAN IMPROVE. THAT WE HAVE THE CAPACITY TO GET BETTER, TO GAIN UNDERSTANDING OF ONE ANOTHER, AND TO GROW OURI OUR ABILITY TOK TOGETHER. I'M TROUBLED -- OH, I SKIPPED SOMETHING. WE ARE HUMAN. WE MAKE JUDGMENTS. WE REACT. AND WE ALSO HAVE THE ABILITY TO RECONSIDER, RE-EARMARKED VAL WAIT AND READDRESS. I'M TROUBLED THAT VIV KLAN CHANS RECOGNIZED AS A VALUE DISTRIBUTOR BY THE HCC AND COUNCILMEMBERS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS YELTSIN IS DENIED A CHANCE TO BE VOTE -- YET IS DENIED A CHANCE TO BE VOTED ON BY THE WHOLE COUNCIL. I'M DEEPLY TROUBLED THAT VIVIAN CHANG'S OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE ON THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION IS BLOCKED FROM COUNCIL VOTE BY ONE INDIVIDUAL. TONIGHT, I HEARD A COMMISSION APPLICANT DESCRIBED AS WONKY. I DON'T MIND WONKY. WHAT I MIND AND SEE AS A NECESSARY IMPROVEMENT IS A NONSUBJECTIVE METHOD OF ASSESSING COMMISSION APPLICANTS. WHAT I ASK YOU TO CONSIDER IS THE ONLY EQUITABLE AND DEMOCRATIC WAY TO APPOINT USING NONSUBJECTIVE CRITERIA, WRITTEN AND SHARED PUBLIC AND SHARED WITH COUNCIL TO EVALUATE, RATE AND VOTE ON. FINALLY, I ASK YOU TO CONSIDER THE ESSENTIAL PART OF THE PROCESS LOST. IF COUNCIL IS NOT PERMITTED TO VOTE ON VIVIAN CHANG'S APPLICATION OR ON ANY APPLICANT WITH HER COMMENDABLE RECORD AND QUALIFICATIONS. IF IT TURNS OUT THAT YOU, AS A COUNCIL, AND WE AS THE COMMUNITY DON'T RECEIVE THE BENEFIT OF VIVIAN CHANG'S CONTINUED SERVICE, I ASK THAT THIS COUNCIL AND THE IMBAHL OF E OF THE SYSTEM TO IMPROVE IT FOR FUTURE APPOINTMENTS. THANK YOU.
06:19:59.035: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
06:20:11.347: >> GOOD MORNING. AS YOU KNOW, I'M THE CURRENT VICE CHAIR OF THE HRC, AND MY TERM WILL EXPIRE AT THE END OF THE MONTH. EYE GREATLY APPRECIATED THE CHANCE TO SERVE ON THE HRC GIVEN MY LONG INTEREST IN HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES. I KNOW THE MEMBERS OF THE CITY COUNCIL HAVE SEEN MY APPLICATION BUT AS HAS BEEN POINTED OUT TODAY, THERE ARE A LOT OF APPLICANTS AND A LOT OF COMMISSIONS. AND SO I WANTED TO NOTE THAT MY APPLICATION SHOWS A LONG HISTORY OF VOLUNTEER WORK AND INTEREST IN PUBLIC SERVICE, ESPECIALLY IN THE AREAS WITH THE IDENTITIES INTERSECT. I'M A CHILD. IMMIGRANTS. I WENT TO LAW SCHOOL TO PURSUE A CAREER IN PUBLIC SERVICE BECAUSE I TOOK MY UNDERGRAD TO BE SERIOUS. I PARTICIPATED IN THE HILLARD HEINTZE SESSION. I PARTICIPATED WITH THE MEETINGS WITH THE CITY STAFF, WITH THE TRESPASS POLICY, AND IN SUBCOMMITTEES TO SELECT MEMBERS OF THE TASK FORCE AND I ATTENDED MULTIPLE TASK FORCE MEETINGS AS WITH WELL DESPITE NOT BEING A PART OF IT. I TOOK THE CRITICISM FROM MEMBERS OF CITY ADMINISTRATION THAT PEOPLE WERE NOT AS IN INFORMED ABOUT THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AS I COULD BE. I SAT DOWN WITH THE DEPUTY POLICE CHIEF TO TALK ABOUT DATA AND I ALSO WENT ON A RIDE-ALONG TOO, ALONG WITH THE INTERN -- THE H. C.,HRC.I CHAIRED THE MAY HRC ME, AND ATTENDED LAST WEEK'S CITY COUNCIL MEETINGEN AI ATTENDED THE POLICE CHIEF MEET AND CRETE AND I CONDUCTED RESEARCH ON ALL OF THEM AND MAKING MY WAY THROUGH THE TAPED PUBLIC INTERVIEWS AND I'M HERE AGAIN TONIGHT. I WORK IN LANSING. I CO-COMMUTE THERE EVERY DAY AND I GOT HOME TODAY AT 6:00. I SAW MY FIANCE FOR 30 MINUTES, AND THEN I CAME HERE AND I HAVE BEEN HERE ALMOST AS LONG AS I WAS AT WORK TODAY. I DON'T KNOW WHAT MORE I CAN DO TO CONVINCE YOU HOW SINCERE I AM ABOUT REPRESENTING IT COMMUNITY AND HOW MUCH I WANT TO BE GIVEN THE BENEFIT OF TRANSPARENT PROCESS WHERE I AM PUT TO A COUNCIL VOTE. THE MAYOR MENTIONED EARLIER THAT THE SET OF PEOPLE WILLING TO PUT THEMSELVES UP TO VOTES ARE NOT UNANIMOUS ARE SMALLER THAN WE MIGHT REALIZE BUT I'M NOT SCARED BY LACK OF UNANIMITY, LET ME LOSE BY A PUBLIC VOTE. I'M NOT AFRAID OF THAT. WHAT I OBJECT TO IS NOT BEING PRESENTED TO CITY COUNCIL FOR A VOTE AT ALL. THANK YOU.
06:22:41.864: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WOULD WHO WOULDLIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT? SEEING NO ONE, PUBLIC COMMENT IS CLOSED. ARE THERE COMMUNICATIONS TODAY FROM COUNCIL?
