00:01:48.329: >> City Admin. Crawford: JUST A COUPLE OF QUICK THINGS. I WANTED TO PUBLICLY RECOGNIZE THE SUPERB WORK THAT OUR CITY CLERK, HER STAFF AND THE MANY ELECTION WORKERS PROVIDED TO THE CITY. IT'S A GREAT EXAMPLE OF DEMOCRACY IN ACTIO IT'S VERY PROFESSIONALLY DONE, AND JUST WANT TO EXPRESS MINE AND MANY PEOPLE'S THANKS FOR THE JOB WELL-DONE. I ALSO WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW THAT YOU HAVE PROBABLY SEEN THE CAMPAIGN -- THE CARE CAMPAIGN THAT THE CITY HAS HAD WITH THE DOWNTOWN MERCHANTS ABOUT WEARING MASKS. YOU WILL SEE -- SOON SEE THAT MORPH INTO A JOINT CAMPAIGN BETWEEN THE CITY AND THE UNIVERSITY CALLED MAIZE IN BLUE AND A2U. THE FOCUS AGAIN IS ON WEARING MASKS, SOCIAL DISTANCING AND WASHING YOUR HANDS. THAT'S ALL, MAYOR.
00:02:36.477: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOR AN INTRODUCTION TODAY, WE HAVE DR. LISA JACKSON, CHAIR OF THE INDEPEENT COMMUTY POLICE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION. DR. JACKSON?
00:03:10.244: >> FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T MME, I'M LISA JACKSON. TUESDAY'S ELECTION WAS HISTORIC IN MANY WAYS, INCLUDING THE RECORD NUMBER OF ABSENTEE AND TOTAL VOTES CAST IN MANY AREAS. KUDOS AGAIN TO ALL THE CLERKS OUT THERE WHO DID THEIR THING REALLY WELL. IT'S ALSO FITTING THAT WE MEE TOY BECAUSE IT THE 55 55th ANNIVERSARY OF THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT, WHICH WAS SIGNED INTO LAW IN 1965. I, OF COURSE, AM DRAWN TO THINK ABOUT THE LATE REPRESENTATIVE JOHN LEWIS, WHO WAS LITERALLY WILLING TO DIE FOR BLACK PEOPLE TO GET THE RIGHT TO VOTE. I ALSO THINK ABOUT DIANE NASH AND OTHER WOMEN LIKE AMELIA BOBOYTON ROBINSON WHO WAS ACTUAY THE ARCHICT OF THE MARCH FROM SELMA TO MONTGOMERY. FROM THE TIME OF ABOLITION, MEN HAVE GOTTEN THE ATTENTION FOR THE STRUGGLE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS AND THE BLACK WOMEN WHO ORGANIZED THE MOVEMENTS HAVE LARGELY BEEN OVERLOOKED. I KNOW THAT MANY OF YOU HAVE BREDHE BLACK LIVES MATTER. IS IS NOT A STRUGGLE THAT ANY OF YOU HAVE LIVED. I IMPLORE YOU AND THE NEWLY ELECTED CITY COUNCILMEMBERS TO BE DILIGENT ABOUT CENTERING MINOR ITIZED VOICES AND CREATING SPACE FOR AND CONSULTING THE EXPERIENCES OF BLACK, INDIGENOUS AND OTHER PEOPLE IN ANN ARBOR, AND WASHTEN CNTY. WE SHOULD REMEMBER THE EXPERIENCES OF BLACK WOMEN AS WE CONSIDER THE HISTORY OF THE PROGRESS WE HAVE MADE. HAVING SAID THAT, I HAVE SOME PROGRESS TO REPORT AS WELL. ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THAT THE POLICE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION ASKED THE POLICE DEPARTMENT FOR WAS TO MAKE THEIR POLICIES PUBLIC. AND SOME OF YOU ARE AWARE THAT THAT'S HAPPENED BUT ARE NOT. I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GIVE CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE, AND NOTE THAT THE ANN AOR POLI DARTMENT HAS ALMOST ALL OF THEIR POLICIES POSTED ON THEIR WEBSITE, WHERE THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC. NEXT, AS THE CITY IS CONTINUING TO MEET WITH THE ANN ARBOR POLICE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION REGARDING THEIR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT, WE HAVE MET WITH THE NEGOTIATING TEAM, AND MADE SOME REQUESTS IN THE INTEREST OF TRANSPARENCY, BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY IN, TERMS OF ACCOUNTABILITY. WE HAVE ALSO BEEN MEETI WITH THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND WE ARE COMMUNICATING WITH OTHER OVERSIGHT AGENCIES AROUND THE COUNTRY, WHO ARE ALSO TRYING TO MAKE POLICIES TO HOLD POLICE MORE ACCOUNTABLE. AND IF YOU ARE UNFAMILIAR WITH THE TOPIC OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND POLICE UNIONS, THE JULY JULY 27th NEW YORKER HAS A COMPREHENSIVE PIECE ON HOW POLICE UNIONS FIGHT REFORM AT THE LOCAL AND STATE LEVEL THUGH PUBLIC RELATIONS, LOBBYING AND POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS. WE'RE ALSO BEGINNING TO WORK ON ANALYZING TRAFFIC STOP DATA. I KNOW A LOT OF YOU HAVE ASKED ABOUT THAT AND IT RANGES FROM 2017 TO 2019. THE GOAL IS TO LOOK AT PATTERNS. WE DON'T KNOW IF ANY EXIST OR WHAT THEY MIGHT BE, BUT WE'LL START TO LOOK AT THAT AND ALSO TO EXAMINE WHETHER THERE MIGHT BE MORE USEFUL DATA TO BE COLLECTED, AND SO WE'LL KEEP YOU POSTED ON OUR PRO E GRESS. THE -- PROGRESS. AFTER RESEARCHING POLICIES ACROSS NORTH AMERICA, SARAH BIRCH AND JUDE WALTON SPEAR HEADED THE DEVELOPMENT OF CONTINGENCY PLAN FOR THE TIMELY SHARING OF INFORMATION IN THE EVENT OF A SERIOUS INCIDENT OF THE POLICE SUCH AS AN OFFICER USING DEADLY FORCE OR CAUSING SERIOUS INJURIES. THE COMMISSIONERS WORK DIRECTLY WITH CHIEF COX AND THE CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE ALSO CONTRIBUTED. ON JULY 1st, ICPOC AS A WHOLE MET AND HAD A ROBUST DISCUSSION WITH THE CHIEF, AND VOTED TO APPROVE THE PLAN. MANY MUNICIPALITIES HAVE SUCH AN AGREEMENT AND WE BELIEVE IT WILL BE USEFUL IN GETTING TIMELY INFORMATION FROM THE OVERSIGHT BODY TO THE COMMUNITY, WHICH, OF COURSE, IMPROVES TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. YOU GUYS WILL SEE THE AGREEMENT IN THE MINUTES FROM JULY 21st. THANK YOU.
00:06:54.735: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. WE NOW COME TO PUBLIC COMMENT RESERVE TIME. PUBLIC COMMENT RESERVE TIME IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO SPEAK TO COUNCIL AND COMMUNITY ABOUT MALTERS OF MUNICIPAL INTEREST. TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT RESERVE TI, ONE NEEDS TOAVE SIGNEDP IN ADVANCE BY CONTACTING OUR CITY CLERK. IN ORDER TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT, AFTER HAVING SIGNED UP, PLEASE DIAL 877-853-5247, ENTER MEETING ID96867158896. SPEAKERS WILL HAVE THREE MINUTES IN WHICH TO SPEAK. THE CLERK WILL NOTIFY YOU AT THE 30 SECOND MARK. PLEASE CEDE THE FLOOR TO THE NEXT SPEAKER. OUR FIRST SPEERODAY IS BLAINE COLEMAN.
00:07:57.731: >> Clerk Beaudry: MAYOR, I WILL ASK FIRST TWO SPEAKERS IF THEY ARE ON THE LINE TO PRESS STAR NINE TO INDICATE WHAT NUMBER THEY ARE CALLING FROM, BECAUSE I DON'T SEE THE NUMBER THAT THEY HAVE INDICATED WHEN THEY SIGNED UP TO SPEAK. AND I DO HAVE A NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL CLERS ON THE LINE. HAD.
00:08:16.650: >> Mayor Taylor: EXCELLENT. THANK YOU.
00:08:18.719: >> Clerk Beaudry: OKAY. I THINK I HAVE THEM HERE. HI, IS THIS BLAINE.
00:08:29.162: >> THIS IS.
00:08:29.730: >> Mayor Taylor: YOU HAVE THE FLOOR, SIR.
00:08:31.231: >> ALL RIGHT. THAN YOU. YOU KNOW THE MAYOR HAS -- AND HIS COALITION HAVE BASICALLY COME UP WITH A FORMULA THAT IS GOING TO GUARANTEE THEM SEATS ON THE CITY COUNCIL PRETTY MUCH FOREVER, AND THE FORMULA IS UNGODLY AMOUNTS OF MONEY, FIRST OF ALL. UNGODLY AMOUNTS OF ADVERTISING, AND USING THE WORD "PROGRESSIVE" LEASTOUR TIMES ON EVERY CARD THAT THEY MAIL TO YOUR HOUSE. AND THEY HAVE DISCOVERED IN THIS ELECTION THAT'S PRETTY MUCH I SURE FIRE FORMULA AND NOBODY CAN BEAT IT. I THINK THERE IS A WAY TO BEAT IT AND I THINK THAT'S BY SHOWING SOME BACK BONE BY BELIEVING IN SOMETHING FOR REAL, AND BY ACTING LIKE IT. I THINK THAT'S THE ONLY WAY, BECAUSE EITHER WAY, ALL OF YOU ON THE SITTING ON THE CITY COUNCIL, YOU ARE LAME DUCKS OR YOU ARE GOING TO BE IN TWO YEARS. THIS IS YOUR OPPORTUNITY, IN MY OPINION, TO ACTUALLY STAND UP FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, WHERE IT COUNTS, TO STAND UP FOR PALESTINIAN HUMAN RIGHTS, FOR EXAMPLE, TO BE TODAY, IN THE YEAR 2020, WHA DIANE NASH WAS IN THE YEAR 1960, TO BE IN THE YEAR 2020 WHAT JoANN ROBINSON WAS IN THE YEAR 1955. TO BE SOMEBODY WHO ACTUALLY STANDS UP FOR HUMAN RIGHTS WHEN IT'S UNPOPULAR TO DO SO. AND TO SUPPORT THE RESOLUTION AINST MITARY AID TO ISRAEL. I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT ISRAEL HAS BEEN MASSACRING THOUSANDS OF PALESTINIANS. I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT ISRAEL IS DOING EVERYTHING IT CAN TO STEAL THE LAND OF MILLIONS OF PALESTINIANS. AND I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU WHAT THAT MEANS FOR 300 MILLION ARABS IN THIS WORLD. IT MEANS DEATH TO THEM TOO. IT MEANS TT I BECOMES A LOT EASIER FOR NOT JUST ISRAEL, BUT THE UNITED STATES TO KILL UNLIMITED NUMBERS OF ARABS. SO WHEN YOU DEVALUE ARAB LIFE LIKE THAT, IT MEANS DEATH FOR AN AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE, FOR MILLIONS ALREADY. THERE'S BEEN A HOLOCAUST AGAINST THE ARAB WORLD JUST IN THE LAST FEW DECADES. STAND UP AT LEAST FOR THINK, TO PALESTINIAN HUMAN RIGHTS, TO STAND UP AT LEAST FOR THE RESOLUTION AGAINST MILITARY AID TO ISRAEL. AND IF YOU SHOW THAT KIND OF BACKBONE, IF YOU SHOW THAT YOU REALLY BELIEVE IN SOMETHING, I THINK YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO KEEP YOUR COUNCIL SEAT, BUT IF YOU DO WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING.
00:11:03.750: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS. DOG, KEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN, PLAYN IT COOL, AND IN TWO YEARS, L. ALL OF YOU ARE GOING TO BE GONE. SO STAND UP FOR SOMETHING. ALL OF YOU. THAT'S ALL I HAD TO SAY, AND I WANT TO HEAR WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY ABOUT IT. I'M DONE. AND THE NEXT SPEAKER IS RIGHT IN LINE BEHIND ME. THAT MOZHGAN.
00:11:29.042: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS MOZHGAN SAVABIEASFAHANI.
00:11:34.915: >> AND YOU HEARD OF RICH POLITICALLY CONNECTED VIAL PEOPLE HAVE INVADED ANN ARBOR CITY COUNSEL SIX THIS IS A GROUP THAT MAYOR TAYLOR CHERISHES AND HE H BEEN BACKING THEM UP AND NOW THEY ARE GOING TO BE HAND IN HAND WITH HIM ON CITY COUNCIL WITHIN A FEW MONTHS. NOBODY WOULD BE ABLE TO SAY NO TO TAYLOR ANY MORE. HE HAS ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE LINED UP TO SHAKE THEIR HEADS AND AGREE WITH HIM ON EVERYTHING. EVERYBODY IN ANN ARBOR KNOWS THAT NOW, THAT THE MAYOR CLIQUE HAS INVADED AND TAKEN OVER NASH CITY COUNCIL. THIS HERD OF RICH POLITICALLY CONNECTED VILE PEOPLE ARE BACKED BY HUGE AMOUNTS OF DUBIOUS CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTNS. TH ARE HERE TO ENSURE THAT BUSINESS GOES AS USUAL IN ANN ARBOR, AS IT HAS BEEN FOR THE PAST SEVERAL ROUNDS OF ELECTIONS, AS FAR AS I REMEMBER. YOU CAN BE SURE THAT THERE WILL BE NO GELMAN CLEANUP. THERE WILL BE NO $15 MINIMUM WAGE. THERE WILL BE NO DECENT HOUSING AT THE SAME TIME AS THEY YELL AND SCREAM ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THERE WILL BE NO DESEGREGATION OF OUR COMMUNITIES WHILE THEY ALL CALL AND SCREAM AND SAY THAT THEY ARE FOR BETTER HOUSING FOR THE POOR. OF COURSE, THEY HAVEN'T AUALLY RBALLY SAID THAT. THEY WILL CALL THEMSELVES PROGRESSIVES, WHILE THEY ARE CONSERVATIVE AS THEY CAN BE. THEY WILL LAVISH YOU WITH ALL KINDS OF LIP SERVICE AND AT THE END OF THE DAY, ANN ARBOR WILL BE MORE SEGREGATED. ANN ARBOR WILL BE MORE POLLUTED AND DEICABLE DISTANCE BETWEEN PEOPLE'S INCOME, WHICH IS RIGHT NOW VERY DESPICABLE, WILL BE EVEN MORE. THERE WILL BE POORER WHO WILL GET MORE POOR AND RICH PEOPLE WHO WILL GET MORE RICH UNDER THE DIRECTIONS OF MR. TAYLOR AND HIS NEWLY ARRIVING HERD OF RICH POLITICALLY CONNECTED,ILE PEOPLE.
00:14:02.829: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
00:14:07.167: >> THE MOST DESPICABLE IS MS. EYER WHO IS NOT ONLY DESPICABLE BECAUSE SHE HAS TIED TO BLACK MONEY PEOPLE. SHE IS ALSO DESPICABLE BECAUSE SHE'SLACK,Y O FRIENDS OF IDF, THAT'S ISRAELI DEFENSE FORCES. SHE IS NOT ONLY -- MS. EYER IS NOT ONLY CONNECTED TO DARK MONEY PEOPLE, BUT SHE IS ALSO BACKED BY THE OLD VETERANS OF THE ISRAELS DEFENSE FORCES.
00:14:41.801: >> Clerk Beaudry: TIME.
00:14:43.036: >> Mayor Taylor: THE NEXT SPEAKERS HEN HERSKOVITZ.
00:14:49.476: >> GOOD EVENING. I'M UP MUTED. GOOD EVENING. COUNCILMEMBERS HAVE LISTENED PATIENTLY OVER THE PAST 18 YEARS, AS SOME OF US SPEAKERS HAVE DESCRIBED THE STATE OF ISRAEL AS A RACIST STATE. SOME COUNCILMEMBERS HAVE TRIBUTED THIS DESCRIPTION, AS MAYOR NAME CALLING FROM DISGRUNTLED CITIZENS. TONIGHT, I WOULD LIKE TO DEMONSTRATE HOW THE TERM "RACIST STATE" IS AN ACCURATE DESCRIPTION OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL, AND NOT MERELY AN ADHOMONYM ATTACK. I WILL BEGIN BY REMINDING COUNCIL TTSRAEL, REISSUED THE NATION STATE LAW IN 2018, AND WILL REFERENCE THAT DOCUMENT AS DESCRIBED IN WIKIPEDIA. INSTEAD OF CITING DIRECTLY, I WILL SUBSTITUTE A FEW WORDS IN ORDER TO MAKE MY POINT. CONSIDER IF SOMEONE IN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WERE TO IDENTIFY THE UNIT STATES AS FOLLOWS: A, AMERICA IS THE HISTORICAL HOMELAND OF THE WHITE PEOPLE IN, WHICH THE UNITED STATES WAS ESTABLISHED. THE UNITED STATES IS THE NATIONAL HOME OF THE WHITE PEOPLE IN WHICH IT FULFILLS ITS NATURAL, CULTURAL, RELIGIOUS AND HISTORIC RIGHT TO SELF-DETERMINATION. C, THE RIGHT TO EXERCISE NATIONAL SELF-DETERMINATION IN THE UNITED STATES IS UNIQUE TO THE WHITE PEOPLE. I PUT IT TO COUNCIL THAT THESE THREE STATEMENTS ARE INCREDIBLY RACIST, AND THAT THE OVERWHELMING PERCENTAGE OF AMERICAN CITIZENS WLD EMPHATICALLY AGREE, YET, I CREATED THOSE STATEMENTS BY RECITING ISRAEL'S 2018 NATION STATE LAW WITH THE FOLLOWING SUBSTITUTIONS. I REPLACED JEWISH WITH WHITE. I REPLACED THE STATE OF ISRAEL WITH THE UNITED STATES. THE ND OF ISRL WITH AMERICA. I INVITE COUNCILMEMBERS AND LISTENERS TO CHECK IT OUT. AMERICANS WOULD NOT TOLERATE SUCH A RACIST AND FALSE DESCRIPTION OF OUR OWN COUNTRY. WHY DO WE NOT ONLY CUTTENCEY IS SUCH A RACIST DESCRIPTION TO ISRAEL, BUT DONATE $10 MILLION EVERY SINGLE DAY TO SUPPORT SUCH RACISM? THANK YOU.
00:17:25.598: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS MICHELLE HUGHES.
00:17:34.507: >> HELLO.
00:17:35.141: >> Mayor Taylor: HELLO, MICHELLE.
00:17:38.211: >> HI. OKAY. IS I MICHELLE HUGHES, AND I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT RANK CHOICE VOTING, AND IT'S A GOOD DAY TO DO THAT. WE JUST HAD OUR ELECTION AND EVERYONE RAN A VIGOROUS CAMPAIGN AND ANN ARBOR DEBATED THE ISSUES THOROUGHLY AND THAT'S THE WAY CAMPAIGNS SHOULD BE. I THINK THAT -- I THINK THE RANK CHOICE VOTING WOULD HELP US ACHIEVE THE GOAL OF HAVING A VIGOROUS DEBATE IN WHICH ALL VOICES ARE HEARD. THE WAY IT IS RIGHT NOW, I THINK THERE'S A -- A LOT OF TIMES WHEN PEOPLE ARE DISCOURAGED FROM RUNNING, PEOPLE WILL SAY WE ALREADY HAVE AANDATE A PEOPLE ARE, YOU KNOW -- PEOPLE I CALL THE SPOILER CANDIDATE, IF THEY WANT TO RUN. OH, THESE PEOPLE HAVE THEIR CANDIDATE. THOSE PEOPLE HAVE THEIR CANDIDATE. YOU DON'T WANT TO BE A SPOILER. SO DON'T RUN. I THINK WE SHOULD BE ENCOURAGING EVERYONE TO RUN. AND THEN WE CAN HEAR ALL SORTS OF NEW OPINIONS AND DEBATE THE TOPICS THOROUGHLY WHICH IS WHAT AND I THINK THE RANK CHOICE VOTING WILL HELP US DO THAT BECAUSE PEOPLE WON'T BE ABLE TO BE SPOILERS ANYMORE. YOU WILL BE ABLE TO PUT YOUR FIRST PREFERENCE, YOUR SECOND PREFERENCE. SO THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS -- SO THAT'S THE REASON I THINK WE SHOULD SUPPORT RANK CHOICE VOTING SO THAT WE CAN HEAR MORE PEOPLE.RE PEOPLE, DIFFERENT I KNOW THERE'S ALSO GOING TO BE SOME TALK TONIGHT ABOUT NONPARTISAN ELECTIONS. AND SO I WANTED TO ADDRESS THAT ALSO. I'M LESS SOLD ON THE IDEA OF NONPARTISAN ELECTIONS. I THINK THAT ANN ARBOR HAS SHOWN OVERELMINGLY OVE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, THAT THEY ARE VERY INTERESTED IN SUPPORTING THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND THEY ARE VERY ENTERED IN SUPPORTING DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES. I THINK IF WE HAD A -- IF WE HAD A NONPARTISAN ELECTION, THEN WHAT PEOPLE WOULD BE INTERESTED IN LOOKING AT IS, OKAY, WELL, WHO DOES THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY ENDORSE TN? THAT WHO I WILL VOTE FOR. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS IN NONPARTISAN ELECTIONS LIKE JUDGES AND SO FORTH, BUT THE THING IS THAT IN THE CASE OF JUDGES OR SCHOOL BOARDS OR THINGS ALREADY NONPARTISAN, THE VOTE GOES TO WHOEVER CAN GET THE MOST PEOPLE TO A PARTICULAR MEETING OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND THAT'S, I THINK --
00:20:14.200: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
00:20:15.401: >> NOT A GOOD WAY TO DETERMINE THAT. I WOULD RATHER WHO GETS THE PARTY NOMINATION TO BE DETERMINED BY VIGOROUS DEBATE THROUGHOUT THE CITY, WHICH IS WHAT WE LOVE TO DO. NOT JUST WHO CAN GET THE MOST PEOPLE TO A PARTICULAR MEETING ON A PARTICULAR NIGHT. IT'S MORE ACCESSIBLE TO HAVE PEOPLE VOTE BY ABSENTEE, VOTE BY MAIL, AND IT'S A BETTER WAY, I THINK TO CHOOSE OUR CANDIDATES. SO I THINK RANK CHOICE VOTING WITH PARTISAN ELECTIONS, WHICH IS IN FRONT OF YOU TONIGHT. VOTE FOR THAT. THANKS!
00:20:48.735: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR. IN SPEAKER IS HENRY MacCNELL.
00:20:55.575: >> AM I MUTED?
00:21:00.546: >> Mayor Taylor: YOU ARE NOT. YOU ARE READY TO GO.
00:21:02.148: >> HELLO AND THANK YOU TO THE HOPPHONORABLE MEMBERS OF THE CIY COUNCIL. I WANT TO SPEAK ABOUT COVID. I'M THE GRANDSON OF A HOLOCAUST SURVIVOR. THE HOLOCAUST WAS REAL. IT KILLED MY GRANDMOTHER AND 6 MILLION JEWS AND LEFT MY GRANDMOTHER WITH LIFE LONG TRAUMA AND STRUGGLE. I'M ONLY HERE BECAUSE LOBA SURVIVED THE HOLOCAUST. TO THE DENIERS ON THOSE CALLS, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THOSE BEANS? AS FOR THE MATTER THE HANDS I'M SPEAKING ABOUT THE URGENT NEED FOR A DOWNTOWN MASK ORDER. I'M AN ANN ARBOR NATIVE WHO SPENT THE PAST FIVE YEARS LIVING IN NEW YORK CITY. I RELOCATED BACK HOME AS THE TIDAL WAVE OF COVID DESCENDED ON NEW YORK IN MARCH. NEW YORK HAS BECOME A MAJOR SUCCESS STORY OF VIRUS CONTROL AND ECONOMIC REOPENING AND PEAPS THE STRGEST REASON IS THIS, UNIVERSAL MASKING. INDOORS AND OUTDOORS. SCIENTISTS SAY THAT WHEN 80 TO 90% OF CITIZENS WEAR A MASK, YOU CONTAIN THE SPREAD EQUIVALENTLY TO A FULL LOCKDOWN, WHILE REOPENED. NEW YORK, WHICH IS NOW IN THE FINAL PHASE OF REOPENING IS PROOF OF THIS AT WORK. MASKs HAS DIRECTLY ENABLED REOPING. NOW IF YOU A IN A ARB, WE HAVE BEEN SPARED OF THE WORST OF COVID BUT WE WILL SOON SEE A MASSIVE INFLUENCE OF DENSITY WITH THE SURGE OF STUDENTS. WE WILL SOON BE TESTED ONCE AGAIN IN THIS COMMUNITY. NOW CRUCIALLY GOVERNMENT WHITMER'S STATEWIDE MASK ORDER MANDES ANY INDIVUAL WHO LEAVES THEIR HOAX MUST WEAR A FACE COVERING OVER THE NOSE AND MASK OR OUTDOORS IF THEY CANNOT MAINMAINTAIN 6 FEET OR MORE. THE PENALTY OF NONCOMPLIANCE. I LIVE DOWNTOWN, AND I BEEN DOWNTOWN AND BEEN ON THE EDGE OF I DOWNTOWN. INDIVIDUALS UNABLE TO MAINTAIN T WEARING MASKS. MEANWHILE IN THE TOWN OF OUR RIVAL SCHOOL, EAST LANSING HAS MUNICIPALITY INSTITUTED A DOWNTOWN MASK ORDER TO BETTER ACCOMMODATE THEIR STUDENTS. HONORABLE COUNCILMEMBERS, I'M CALLING ON YOU TONIGHT TO DO THE SAME. INSTITUTE A DOWNTOWN MASKING ORDER BEFORE STUDENTS RETURN, AND TO MILIZE NECESSARY RESOURCES TO PEACEFULLY ENFORCE IT.
00:23:31.831: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
00:23:32.798: >> BY INSTITUTING A DOWNTOWN MASK ORDER. WE CAN MAINTAIN THE FRAGILE REOPENING. IT WILL SUSTAIN THE LOCAL ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. I'M CALLING ON ALL OF YOU TO FIND WAYS WITH THE CITY ADMINISTRATION TO PEACEFULLY ENFORCE THIS OUTDOOR MASKING FORCE.THOUT THESE OF POLICE THIS COULD LOOK LIKE IN NEW YORK CITY, FOR EXAMPLE, PARK RANGERS WHO ARE DEPLOYED TO DENSE PUBLIC AREAS, FREELY HAND OUT MASKS TO THE CROWDS, SIGNAGE, ET CETERA. IN CONCLUSION, BY TAKING THESE MEASURES, YOU CAN CONTROL THE VIRUS TODAY, RATHER THAN LETTING THE VIRUS CONTROL US TOMORROW. WITH THIS ORDER AND PEACEFUL LAW ENFORCEMENT, WE CAN ENSURE THE ONGOG HEAL OF O ECOMY AN CITIZENS. THANK YOU AND I WISH YOU ALL HEALTH AND SAFETY AS THIS PANDEMIC RAGES ON.
00:24:18.210: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. ARE THERE COMMUNICATIONS TODAY FROM COUNCIL? I HAVE COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD. PARDON ME. MS. BEAUDRY, IF YOU CLDIVE ME RAISING AND LOWERING HAND PRIVILEGES, THAT WOULD BE GRATEFUL.
00:24:38.864: >> Clerk Beaudry: YOU SHOULD HAVE THAT.
00:24:45.371: >> Mayor Taylor: PERHAPS NO ONE HAS RAISED THEIR HANDS.
00:24:50.443: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I CAN'T FIND MY MECHANICAL HAND AT THE MOMENT.
00:24:52.945: >> Mayor Taylor: I HAVE MECHANICAL HANDS UP, BUT MS. COUNCIEMBER GRISWOLD, YOU WERE FIRST IN THE QUEUE NEVERTHELESS, BUT IT'S WORKING WITH OTHERS, COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD AND COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
00:25:05.691: >> Councilmember Griswold: FIRST THING I WANT TO MENTION, THERE WILL BE A DINGLE UNITY LUNCH THIS SUNDAY AT NOON IN ISLAND PARK. INVITATIONS WERE SENT OUT THROUGH THE WASHTENAW COUNTY DEMOCRATIC PTY BUT IN CASE ANYONE MISSED GETTING AN INVITATION, YOU CAN GO TO MY FACEBOOK PAGE FOR MORE INFORMATION. A MASK WILL BE REQUIRED. WE URGE YOU TO BRING A CHAIR. WE'LL HAVE A SOUND SYSTEM SO THAT YOU CAN SAFE SOCIAL DISTANCE AS FAR AWAY AS YOU WANT AND STILL HEAR THE SPEAKERS. SO I EOURA PEOPLE TO COM THIS I THE TIME FOR UNITY. THIS IS THE TIME TO DEVELOP STRATEGIES SO THAT WE WILL HAVE VICTORIES IN NOVEMBER AT THE STATE AND FEDERAL LEVEL. I ATTENDED A MEETING LAST WEEK REGARDING THE LOWER TOWN STUDY, THIS IS HALF MILLION DOLLARS PLUS STUDY, TRAFFIC STUDY THE LOWER TOWN AREA. IT WAS CONDUCTED BY SENIOR ENGINEERS AND OTHERS. THEY DID A SAFETY AUDIT AND THREE THINGS CAUGHT MY ATTENTION. WE HAVE LESS THAN OPTIMAL SIGN PLACEMENT. SOME OF OUR SIGNS ARE NOT IN THE RIGHT PLACE. VEGETATION. OVERGROWN VEGETATION CREATES SIGHT DISTANCE PROBLEMS. AND THE THIRD WAS A LACK OF LIGHTING. IT WAS NICE TO HEAR SENIOR ENGINEERS AND TRANSPORTATION OFFICIALS REPEAT WHAT I HAVE BEEN SAYING FOR MANY YEARS AND I HOPE THAT GIVEN THAT WE ARE SPENDING HALF A MILLION DOLLARS, THAT WE WILL ACTUALLY TAKE SOME OF THEIR STATEMENTS SERIOUSLY. LASTLY, I WOULD CONTINUE TO WORK ON IMPROVEMENTS TO THE HURON CROSSWALK NEAR THAYER. THAT IS MDOT JURISDICTION. MDOT RIGHT NOW IS ON HOLD BECAUSE OF AN ORGANIZATION CALL CHIPO THAT I NEVER HEARD OF BEFORE. IT'S THE STATE HISTORIC PRESERVATION OFFICE. AND THEY SEEM TO BELIEVE THAT STREETLIGHTS ARE UNSIGHTLY. I WOULD LIKE T TNK SENATOR JEFF IRWIN. HIS STAFF IS LOOKING INTO THIS. I'M OPTIMISTIC THAT WE CAN STILL GET OUR RRFBs INSTALLED THIS YEAR.

THANK YOU TO EFFORT WHO RAN FOR COUNCIL THIS YEAR. IT TAKES A LOT OF GUTS TO RUN FOR OFFICE IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC, AND -- AND I APPRECIATE ALL OF THOSE EFFORTS.

AND THE DDA NOW HAS DECIDED TO SHIFT ITS -- ITS PRIMARY FOCUS AND MORE ON THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING ASPECTS OF O COMMUNITY. SO THAT'S A POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT FOR MANY OUR COMMUNITY. MORE TO COME ON THAT.

00:37:51.723: >> MAYOR TAYLOR, COUNCILMEMBERS AND CITY STAFF. MY NAME IS KEVIN GUCHOSKI AND I WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS MY CONCERN OVER THE PROPOSED SHORT-TERM NTAL ORDINANCE A IT'S CURRENTLY WRITTEN. DESPITE THE WISHES OF MANY IN THIS COMMUNITY, EVEN EVEN SOME MEMBERS OF THIS BODY, THE ORDINANCE REMAINS UNCHANGED AND INCLUDES OVERLY RESTRICTIVE MEASURES AND PROBLEMATIC LANGUAGE THAT WILL DO REAL DAMAGE TO VARIOUS GROUPS AND STAKEHOLDERS THROUGHOUT THIS COMMUNITY. MANY WHOM HAVE SKEN EITHER HERE TONIGHT AND CITIZENS WHO YOU REPRESENT, BUT WHOSE COMMENTS HAVE FALLEN ON ENVIRONMENT EARS OVER THESE MANY MONTHS. NO ONE IS SHE S SAYING THAT SHOM RENTALS SHOULD NOT BE REGULATION. LICENSING AND ELIMINATING FOR NON-PROBLEMATIC PROPERTIES, IT'S PRETTYUCH SUPPORTED BY ALL, BUT THE SIMPLE FACT IS, ANN ARBOR DOES NOT CURRENTLY HAVE ANY REGULATIONS OR CLASSIFICATION OF RENTALS BASED ON TERM LENGTH. ALL NONOWNER OCCUPIED SCRs IN THE CITY, AS LONG AS THEY COMPLIED PASSED ALL INSPECTIONS AND LICENSED AND BEEN OPERATING AS LEGAL RENTALS. THIS ORDINANCE, WHICH WILL BAN THE ST Rs THROUGHOUT MOST OF THE CITY AND PROPOSED A CHANGE TO THIS STATUS QUO. AND BECAUSE THE RULES GOVERNS RENTALS POTENTIALLY CHANGING, LICENSED, NONOWNER OCCUPIED STRs ARE THE DEFINITION OF A HE LEGALON-CONRMG USE. I ASK COUNCIL TO GOVERN WITH A LIGHT TOUCH AND BASE IT ON FACTS AND FIGURES AND NOT VAGUE FEELINGS  OR ANECDOTES PLEASE SEND IT BACK TO STAFF AND INCLUDE PROVISIONS TO GRANDFATHER LEGALLY OPERATED NONOWNER OCCUPIED SHORT-TERM RENTALS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
00:39:55.080: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
00:39:57.816: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER 693, PHONE NUMBER ENDING IN 693.
00:40:04.155: >> HELLO. MY NAME IS WENDY CARMEN, I LIVE AT 2340 GEORGETOWN AND I HAVE MEANT MANY YEARS ON THIS DB AX, AS WELL AS ON VARIOUS LAND USE COMMITTEES. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THE CITY RECEIVED MANY COMPLAINTS FROM CITIZENS WHOSE LIVES WERE DISRUPTED BY INTRUSIVE AND ABUSIVE ACTIVITIES OCCURRING ONLY AFTER THIS NEW IDEA BECAME POPULAR. THE CONSULTANT THE CITY HIRED TO DETERMINE -- TO SURVEY STRs FOUNWEOULDN'T STATE WITH CERTAINLY HOW MANY THERE WERE, WHO WERE DOING IT, OR WHAT PROPORTION HAD EVER GOTTEN ANY PERMANENCE. STAFF HAS NOW PRESENTED YOU WITH A PROPOSED ORDINANCE THAT PROVIDES SOME MEASURE OF REGULATION OVER OWNER OCCUPIED UNITS AND NONOWNER OCCUPIED UNITS IN NONRESIDENTIAL AREAS AND WOULD SHUT DOWN NONOWNER OCPIED UNITSN RESIDENT -- IN RESIDENTIAL AREAS. UNDERSTANDABLY THE OWNERS OF THESE BUSINESSES IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS HAVE THREATENED LAWSUITS AND ARE PROBABLY BACKED BY AIRBNB MONEY. THEY ARE MAKING CLAIMS THAT THEIR UNITS WERE LEGALLY ESTABLISHED AND YOU MUST AT LEAST GRANDFATHER THEM IN. DID WE KNOWINGLY GIVE THEM PERMITTED TO RUN AN STR? OR DID THEY GET PERMITS FROM LONG-TERM RENTALS. WITH HAVE LANGUAGE IN THE ZONING CHAPTER, NOW IN THE UDC WHICH BASICALLY PROHIBITS THEM. I WOULD ARGUE THAT NO STR WAS AUTHORIZED BY THE CITY BECAUSE OUR ORDINANCES AND DEFINITIONS DO NOT PERMIT THEM. OUR DEFINITION OF WHO CAN OCCUPY RESIDENTIAL UNITS IS BASED ON DEFINITIONS OF FAMILYND FUNCTIONAL FAMILY, THAT REQUIRES SOME MEASURE OF PERMANENCE THAT WOULD NOT PERMIT STRs. IF ANY ARE TO BE GRANDFATHERED, THEY WOULD PROBABLY HAVE TO PROVE THAT THEY ARE IN EXISTENCE BEFORE THE CURRENT DEFINITION, FAMILY AND FUNCTIONAL FAMILY WERE INTRODUCED INTO OUR ORDINANCES. I THINK WE CAN DECIDE THAT THERE'S SOMEATEGORIES O S. STRs THAT WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE AND SOME CATEGORIES OF STRs THAT WE DON'T WANT TO ENCOURAGE. THE QUESTION IS NOT SHOULD WE PASS LEGISLATION. WE NEED TO PASS THE LEGISLATION. THE QUESTION STILL IS WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN TO THE NONOWNER OCCUPIED UNITS IN RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS. DER WHAT CIRMSTANCES AND WITH WHAT SUPER REGULATIONS WOULD WE BE WILLING TO GRANDFATHER THEM IN? IF YOU PASS THIS TODAY, IT'S NOT ENFORCEABLE FOR 45 DAYS. I IMPLORE YOU TO USE THOSE 45 DAYS AND DECIDE WHAT OUR CASE MAY BE. WITH THIS PROCESS IN PLACE, WE CAN COME TO AN AGREEMENT THAT -- EXACTLY -- AN INFORMED AGREEMENT ABOUT WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO DO ABOUT THIS. THANK YOU.
00:42:55.827: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
00:43:05.437: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER ENDING -- PHONE NUMBER ENDING IN 815.
00:43:12.310: >> HI. I'M A PROPERTY OWNER IN THE FOURTH WARD AND RESPECTFULLY REQUESTING THE PROPOSED ORDINANCE RESTRICTING NONOWNERS OCCUPIED STRs BE SENT BACK TO THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR'S FOR REVISION AND INCLUSION OF LEGAL NON-CONFORNG STATUSOR LEGALLY OPERATING LANDLORDS IS A RIGHT THAT HAS BEEN UPHELD BY THE MICHIGAN SUPREME COURT. WE PURCHASED OUR PROPERTY TWO BLOCKS FROM OUR FIRST ANN ARBOR HOME AND THE NEIGHBORHOOD IS SPECIAL TO US. OUR NEIGHBORS HAVE TAKEN GREAT INTEREST, APPRECIATION, AND RELIEF OVER THE 18 MONTHS WE HAVE COMPLETELY RENOVATED A NOISE AND DRUG NUISANCE HOME AND EYE SORE ON T STREE WE HAVE DONE THE WORK OURSELVES AS A PASSION AND AS A WORK IN OUR RETIREMENT. WE DO NOT AS RIDICULOUSLY SUGGESTED BY COUNCILMEMBERS OPERATE OUR RENTAL IN THE WILD, WILD WEST OF AIRBNB AND WE DO NOT DO IT FOR THE HIGH AEST AND BEST PRICE. WE CERTAINLY DO NOT RENT TO DRUG DEALERS. TOOMPARES TO THIS IS INSULTING. OUR INTENT WAS TO NEVER LONG TERM RENT OR FLIP AND SALE, AS WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT OUR OPTIONS BY COUNCILMEMBERS, WHICH IS INAPPROPRIATELY AND GROSSLY PRESUMPTIVE. WE VET OUR RENTERS BECAUSE WE WANT OUR PROPERTY CARED FOR AND RESPECTED. WE HAVE DEVELOPED LIFE FRIENDSHIPS WITH MANY OF THE FAMILIES WHO HAVE STAYED WITH US AND PLAN TO RETUREXT YEAR. THESE PEOPLE HAVE ALSO GOTTEN TO KNOW OUR NEIGHBORS DURING THEIR STAY. OUR NEXT DOOR NEIGHBORS CANNOT FATHOM WHY THE CITY IS SO AGAINST US. THEY ARE GRATEFUL FOR OUR PRESENCE AND OUR CONTRIBUTION TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD CHARACTER. THEY SAID THEY WERE A BIT WORRIED IN THE BEGINNING ABOUT LIVING NEXT TO AN STR BUT THAT OUR PRESENCE HAS BEEN AN IMPROVEMENT ON THE STREET. WEELPUR NEIBORS WITH WHATEVER THEY NEED AND ARE PRESENT AT THE HOME EVERY DAY IT'S NOT RENTED. TO ARE ALL THE WORK WE HAVE DONE, THE DOUBLE TAXES WE PAY, THE RELATIONSHIPS WE HAVE DEVELOPED, WE ARE SET TO BE PENALIZED DESPITE A SUPREME COURT RULING. I'M PROUD TO BE PART OF A VERY SMALL GROUP OF COMMITTED AND RESPONSIBLE NONOWNER OCCUPIED OWNERS. WE HAVE BEEN ASKING, PADING R THIS CITY TO SIT DOWN AND WORK WITH US, TO DEVELOP A FAIR WIN/WIN POLICY ON STRs AND WE HAVE EFFECTIVELY BEEN IGNORED. NOT ONCE HAVE WE BEEN ASKED TO SIT WITH THE CITY TO NEGOTIATE. IT'S BAD GOVERNANCE BY AN ELECTED COUNCIL. WE APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT FROM THOSE OF YOU WHO VALUE A REASONABLE AND FAIR APPROACH THAT WOULD PROTECT O EXISTING RIGHTS. WE HAVE WORKED HARD FOR OUR RIGHTS. WE ARE ORGANIZED. WE HAVE THE WILL. WE HAVE THE RESOLVE. WE HAVE THE SUPPORT OF THE SUPREME COURT, AND WE HAVE THE RESOURCES TO PROTECT THIS RIGHT.
00:45:52.670: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
00:45:53.438: >> TO TAKE THIS DOWN AN EXPENSIVE PATH FOR THE CITY IS SOMETHING THAT -- FOR SOMETHING THAT DOES NOT MERIT THAT EXPEN IS DISSERVICE TOHE TAXPAYERS. ASK THAT THIS ORDINANCE BE SENT BACK TO THE CITY FOR THE REVISION TO GRANT US LEGAL NON-CONFORMING STATUS. REASONABLE AND FAIR. THANK YOU.
00:46:14.692: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
00:46:23.101: >> Clerk Beary: CALLER EING IN PHONE NUMBER 692. CALLER 692, YOU CAN GO AHEAD.
00:46:33.578: >> HELLO. MY NAME IS KAY, I AM AN OWNER OF A NON-OCCUPIED STR. PRIOR IN THE PROSS, WE WENT INTO THIS WHOLE ATTEMPT TO REGULATE THE STRt R, I GAVE A TK AT UP WITH THE COMMISSIONS MEETING IN THE EVENING. AND I CAME AGAIN TO SAY THAT. OCCUPIED Ss,HICH I OWN ONE OF, WE HAVE BEEN HOSTING A NUMBER OF FAMILIES, AND I TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE FAMILIES THAT WE DO SERVICE IN THIS COMMUNITY. PEOPLE WHO COME TO THE HOSPITALS AND TAKE CARE OF THEIR FAMILY D NEED A SAF PLACE TO STAY. EVEN IN THIS TIME OF PANDEMIC, WE HAVE SEEN MORE PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD MORE OPTIONS, WHERE THEY COULD STAY IN A SPACE THAT IS FREE OF ANY FEAR OF WHO THEY ARE INTERACTING IN THE HALLWAYS OF HOTELS AND. AND IF WE ALL REALLY LOOK AT THE RUSH IS TO HAVE TO ACTUALLY VOTE ON THIS AND GET THIS DONE FAIRLY QUICKLY. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CITIES ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY AND ALL OVER THE WORLD THAT ARE HOSTING SHORT-TERM RENTALS AND THE PRIOR KNOWLEDGE HERE IN THIS CITY, THAT THIS NEEDS TO BE TAKEN CARE MAYBSOME POWERFUL PERSON ISAT BEHIND ALL OF. THIS WHEN WE FIRST STARTED TALKING ABOUT ALL OF THIS, WE TALKED ABOUT IN TERMS OF HOW WE CREATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THAT IS REALLY RIDICULOUS. WE ALL KNOW THAT. IF ANYBODY THINKS ON THIS COUNCIL NOW, ACTUALLY BELIEVES THIS, IS IS A WAY TO TAKE CARE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING, THEY ARE FOOLING THEMSELVES. REALLY THE ISSUES HERE IS BECAUSE THERE ARE POWERFUL BACKDOOR DEALINGS THAT TALK ABOUT HOW WE MAKE SURE THAT THIS DOESN'T BECOME A THING IN ANN ARBOR. WE PROVIDE A SERVICE. WE PROVIDE A SERVICE FOR PEOPLE WHO COME TO THI COMMUNITY, LOOKING FOR PLACES TO STAY. WHETHER THEY ARE HERE FOR THE HOSPITAL, OR THEY ARE BEING RECRUITED BY THE UNIVERSITY.
00:49:09.200: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
00:49:10.201: >> WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING PROGRAMS, AND THEY NEEDED A PLACE TO STAY. WE PROVIDE PLACES FOR PARENTS WHO COME TO VISIT THEIR CHILDREN AS HER HERE IN THE UNIVERSITY OVER HERE, FOR A PLACE WHERE THEY CAN HOST -- WE PROVIDE PLACES FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE -- WHO COME HERE TO VISIT FAMILY MEMBERS AS WELL. THESE ARE PROPERTIES THAT WE TAKE CARE. WE PAY OUR TAXES. WE REGISTER OUR PROPERTIES AND WE APPLY EVERY RULE THAT IS CREATED.
00:49:42.400: >> Clerk Beaudry: TIME.
00:49:42.934: >> SO NOW --
00:49:44.669: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
00:49:49.607: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER ENDING IN PHONE NUMBER 811.
00:49:56.614: >> HELLO. MY NAME IS MICHAEL STERNS. I LIVE ON NEWPORT ROAD. AND I WANTE TO THANK T COUNCIL FOR DEALING WITH THIS ISSUE. IT'S BEEN A PROBLEM FOR ME EVER SINCE A MOTEL MOVED IN NEXT DOOR TO ME IN MY RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD, AND I WOULD LIKE TO LIVE IN A RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD AGAIN INSTEAD OF NEXT DOOR TO A MOTEL. THERE'S AN INVESTING COMMUNITY OUT THE THAT HAS FIGED OUT HOW TO MONETIZE ANN ARBOR'S RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS, AND I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A NEIGHBOR AGAIN, RATHER THAN THREE DIFFERENT PEOPLE EVERY WEEK, SIX, EIGHT CARS, PARTIES OR NOT PARTIES OR FAMILIES OR WHATEVER. I JUST WANT TO HAVE A NEIGHBOR AND I THANK YOU FOR DEALING WH THIS. HAVING SAID THAT, I -- I READ THE LEGISLATION AND THERE'S A PRETTY BIG HOLE IN IT RIGHT NOW. THE HOLE BEING THE SECTION ABOUT PRINCIPAL RESIDENCE WHOLE HOUSE SHORT-TERM RENTING. SO IF A PLACE WHERE THERE ARE INVESTORS OR AN INVESR W H QUACQUIRED A PROPERTY IN A SINGE FAMILY NEIGHBORHOOD AND TURN IT INTO A MOTEL, IF THEY CAN SIGN A LEASE WITH SOMEBODY IN THE COMPANY, SOMEBODY IN THE FAMILY, SOMEBODY, ANYBODY, THEN THEY CAN CONTINUE TO RUNNING THE MOTEL. NOBODY REALLY HAS TO LIVE THERE. NOBODY HAS TO STAY THERE. YOU COULD A CLEANER SIGN A LEASE. SO WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO ASK THAT COUNCIL PUT AN AMENDMENT OR, YOU KNOW, DO SOMETHING, IS TO PUT A NUMBER OF LIMIT ON THE DAY -- THE LIMIT ON THE NUMBER OF DAYS PER MONTH THAT THAT EXCEPTION, PRINCIPAL RESIDENCE, WHOLE HOUSE RENTAL CAN BE DONE PER MONTH. SO THAT IT'S ONLY REALLY AVAILED BY SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY LIVES THERE AS OPPOSED TO SOMEBODY WHO PRETENDS TO LIVE THERE. ONCE AGAIN, I THANK YOU FOR DEALING WITH THIS. THE -- THE LACK OF LEGISLATION HAS BEEN A BIG PROBLEM WITH ME, AND THE PEACE AND QUIET AND THE ENJOYMENT OF ANY PRO MY PROPERTI THINK IT'S LONG ORDUE, THE MONETIZATION OF OUR RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS. THAT'S ALL I GOT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
00:52:21.959: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
00:52:28.299: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER ENDING IN PHONE NUMBER 280. HI, CALLER 280. YOU CAN GO AHEAD.
00:52:41.379: >> HELLO, I AM -- MY NAME IS LOLA AND I'M A PROPERTY OWNER AND I'M HERE TO ASK THAT COUNCIL SENDS THIS ORDINANCE BACK TO CITY STAFF, FOR THE PURPOSE OF EXEMPTING PEOPLE OPERATING NONRESENTIAL, SHORTERM RENTAL PROPERTIES FROM THIS ORDINANCE. AS MANY OF MY FELLOW OWNERS HAVE SAID, WE WERE OPERATING LEGALLY. WE HAVE NOT VIOLATED ANY CITY RULE. AND WE ARE NOT ASKING YOU TO VOTE DOWN THE ORDINANCE, WE ARE ASKING FOR A GRANDFATHERING OR LEGAL NON-CONFORMING STATUS HERE. THIS ORDINANCE COULD HAVE BEEN PROPOSED WITH THIS PROTECTION IN PLACE, YET IT HAS NOT. THERE'S OVER 50,000 DWELLINGS IN ANN ARBOR AND ONLY ABOUT 100 ARE NONRESIDENTIAL SHORT-TERM RENTALS. AND MANY OF US, AS YOU HAVE HEARD, ARE ANN ARBRITES. WE LIVE HE. WE LIVE NEXT DOOR TO OUR PROPERTY AND WE TAKE CARE OF OUR PROPERTY AND WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT WE EMPLOY AS PART OF THIS BUSINESS, AS PART OF THIS HOME. AND SO WE ARE ASKING THAT YOU REALLY CONSIDER US -- AND, AGAIN, MANY PEOPLE HAVE SAID THIS. IT'S VERY DISAPPOINTING THAT COUNLMEMBER IN LTEETING WAS COMPARING US TO DRUG DEALERS, AND SUGGESTING THAT WE ARE BEING BACKED BY BIG CORPORATION AIRBNB. I'M A SINGLE FAMILY PERSON WHO LIVES IN ANN ARBOR AND I DON'T HAVE ANY BACKING OF ANYTHING. I'M JUST TRYING TO LIVE AFFORDABLY IN THE CITY, A EARN SOME MONEY ON A PROPERTY AND TO BE COMPARED TO CORPORATION OR DRUG DEALER, IT'S HURTFUL. I'M A MEMBER OF THIS -- I PAY TAXES AND I SUPPORT MANY OF THE INITIATIVES IN THIS CITY. SO I'M ASKING FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE PEOPLE TOO. AND I DON'T UNDERSTAN WHY SOMEBODY'S DESIRE TO-N LIVE NEXT TO A NEIGHBOR ON ONE SIDE, SHOULD OVERRIDE MY OWN RIGHT AS A PROPERTY OWNER. IT'S ABSOLUTELY JUST NOT FAIR. AS MANY PEOPLE BEFORE ME HAVE STATED, MANY OF THE CURRENT OWNERS HERE DO NOT -- THE AMOUNT OF NONOWNER OCCUPIED STR IS LESS THAN 1%. SO THIS IS NOT ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WE ARE NOT THE CAUSE OF --
00:55:15.933: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS. -- OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THIS CITY. WE ARE JUST ASKING YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE PUT OUR SWEAT AND BLOOD, AT LEAST I KNOW I HAVE, INTO THIS AND YOU ARE BLOCKING WITHOUT GIVING U THIS RIGHT, WILL HAVE DEVASTATING FINANCIAL ISSUES. YOU KNOW, MY SAVINGS THAT I HAVE INESTINVESTED IN THIS, AND I LOD AND THERE WERE NO RULES ON THE BOOKS THAT SAID I COULDN'T DO THIS. AND NOW YOU ARE GOING TO CHANGE THE RULES AND ESSENTIALLY RUIN -- CL
00:55:53.671: >> Clerk Beaudry: TIME. CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING 626. CALLER 626, GO AHEAD.
00:56:06.550: >> MY NAME IS ERIC ZUAGAB AND I' A RLTOR IN THENN ARBOR AREA. NO MATTER WHO THEY ARE, THEY DEEPLY CARE FOR THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. MANY OF THE PEOPLE I WORK WITH, WHETHER THEY ARE OCCUPYING THEIR PROPERTY OR NOT, CONSIDER RENTING OUT THEIR PROPERTY, EITHER FOR LONG-TERM RENTALS OR SHORT-TERM RENTALS. I IMPLORE THE CITY COUNCIL TO LOOK AT THE FINANCIAL HARDSHIP FOR THOSE WHO SET UP THE STRUCTURE FOR SHORT-TERM RENTAL FOR THEY AREWNIVELIHOODUT THE PROPERTY OWNERS WHO PURCHASED PROPERTY IN ANN ARBOR TO LIVE BUT HAVE THE OPTION IN THE FUTURE TO REPRESENT OUT THEIR PROPERTIES AS SHORT-TERM RENTALS. ELIMINATING THIS OPTION IS AN ELIMINATION OF HOME OPENER RIGHTS. I -- HOMEOWNER RIGHTS. I WOULD LIKE THE CITY COUNCIL TO CONSIDER THEIR OWN ARGUMENT, THAT SHORT-TERM RENTALS ARE A THREAT TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IT REPRESENTS LESS THAN 2%. I SUGGEST THEY FIT BETTER NUMBERS TO FIT THEIR ARGUMENT. I ASK THE CITY COUNCIL TO MOVE THIS BACK TO CITY STAFF FOR LEGALLY OPERATING SHORT-TERM RENTALS FROM THIS ORDINANCE. THANK U.
00:57:17.655: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
00:57:25.729: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING IN 509.
00:57:30.868: >> HI. THIS IS HEIDI POSHER, 1204 BROOK LIB. I'M WITH A GROUP OF 50 SHORT-TERM IF THEY ENACT APRIL ORDINANCE BEFORE YOU. WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT CLAIMING RIGHTS ALREADY GRANTED TO US BY THE MICHIGAN SUPREME COURT, EVEN IF THAT MEANS LITIGATION. YES, SUBSTANTIALLY IN LEGAL REPRESENTATION SO WE CAN ENGAGE IN THIS PROCESS, KNOWING EXACTLY WHERE WE STAND. WE DO APPRECIATE THAT THERE ARE MANIES OF COUNCILHAT FEEL VER STRONGLY ABOUT THE NEED FOR THIS OR NANCE. WE SEE YOUR PASSION AND -- ORDINANCE. WE SEE YOUR PASSION AND WE LISTENED RESPECTFULLY ARE. WE DON'T HAVE PROBLEMS WITH NEW RULES TO PROTECT THE PROPERTY RIGHTS. THE PROBLEM IS THAT AS PROPOSED THESE NEW RULES TRAMPLE OUR PROPERTY RIGHTS, NOT ONLY IS THIS INCREDIBLY UNFAIR, BUT ILLEGAL. THE ORDINANCE COULD HAVE BEEN PROPOS WITH THESE PROTECTIONS IN PLACE, AS MANY PEOPLE HAVE MENTIONED, THERE ARE OVER 50,000 DWELLING UNITS IN ANN ARBOR. THERE'S ABOUT 120 NONRESIDENTIAL SHORT-TERM RENTALS GRANTING AN EXCEPTION WILL MAKE NO DIFFERENCE IN THE SUCCESS OF THIS. IRONICALLY, PART OF THE FINANCIAL LOSS IS AN INVEST IN SYSTEMS, EMPLOYEES AND TRAINING THAT MAKE US RESPONSIBLE NEIGHBORS AT THE SHORT-TERM RENTALS WE OWN. A LEGAL ABOUT THELE WOULDN'T BE MOUNTED OUT OF AINGE OR FRUSTRATION. IT -- ANGER OR FRUSTRATION. AS AN ASIDE, I HEAR THE PEOPLE STRUGGLING WITH SITUATIONS IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS WITH ANY FORM OF AIRBNB AND I WOULD PROPOSE WITH GOOD IMPLEMENT OF THIS ORDINANCE AND WITH THE HELP OF THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN RUNNING NONRESIDENT SHORT-TERM RENTALS BECAUSE WE HAVE STAFF, WE HAVE SYSTEMS, WE HAVE TRAINED PEOPLE WORKING FOR US, WE COULD REALLY HELP OUT WITH THIS SITUATION IN TERMS O HELPING TH CITY DEVEL GUIDELINES AND POLICIES THAT WOULD SOLVE MANY OF THESE PROBLEMS. WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE ADMINISTRATION BELIEVES THAT WITH CAREFUL WORDING THEY FOUND A LOOPHOLE THAT COULD IMPLEMENT THIS ORDINANCE WITHOUT ANY CONCERN FOR MICHIGAN LAW. HOWEVER, AT THE END OF THE DAY, THIS ORDINCE WESOUND FINANCIALLY DEVASTATING FOR A SPECIFIC GROUP OF PROPERTY OWNERS AND THAT'S WHY LEGAL NON-CONFORMING LAW WAS PUT INTO PLACE. WE HAVE GONE INTO A GREAT DEAL OF EXPENSE TO MAKE SURE WE DON'T COME TO COUNCIL WITH OUTLANDISH OR UNWINNABLE CLAIMS. WE HAVE LITTLE TO LOSE IN CONTINUING TO PURSUE OUR RIGHTS. WE ARE NOT A MOB OF ANGRY VILLAGERS WITH TORCHES AND PITCH FORKS ARBITRARILY THREATENING TO SUE. THIS SKIRTS MICHIGAN LAW. IN THE PROCESS, IT'S DAMAGING PROPERTY OWNERS. IT'S AN EXTREMELY TRANSPARENT END AROUND AND I INVITE YOU TO CONSIDER THE OPTICS OF THAT AS WE PUSH FORWARD TOWARDS RESOLUTION. PLSE SEN THIRDINANCEACK TOHE ADMINISTRATION WITH DIRECTIONS TO TREAT EXISTING, LEGAL, NONRESIDENTIAL SHORT-TERM RENTAL PROPERTY OWNERS FAIRLY THROUGH THE CREATION OF APRIL AN EXEMPTION. THANK YOU.

I'M A PARENT OF FOUR GIRLS SOON TO BE FIVE. I'M A WIFE OF AN ANN ARBOR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER, AND I'M TAX PAYING AND VOTING RESIDENT OF THIS CITY. I MAINTAIN POSITIVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH ALL OF MY NEIGHBORS. MY KIDS HAVE ATTENDED ANN ARBOR SCHOOLS AND WE ARE ACTIVE IN OUR COMMUNITY. I AM NOT BACKED BY A BANK. I'M NOT AN INVESTOR AND I DON'T HAVE A TRUST FUND. I'M NOT IERESTED I BUYING UP HUNDREDS OF HOMES TO PAD MY WALLET. I'M A MIDDLE-CLASS WORKING ANN ARBOR RESIDENT JUST LIKE MANY OF YOU WHO INVESTS IN MY HOME THAT WILL PAY OFF FOR THE FUTURE OF MY FAMILY. WE WILL BOUGHT OUR HOME NOT TO MAKE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS BUT TO INVEST IN A HOME THAT WE AND OUR KIDS WILL LIVE IN. WE DON'T MAKE LOADS OF MON OFF THIS YEAR, THE FINCIAL IACT OF COVID HAS BEEN QUITE DEVASTATING TO US AND SO MANY OTHER HOMEOWNERS. NONE THELESS, WE CONTINUE TO INVEST WHAT MONEY WE CAN IN OUR HOME AND IMPROVE THE NEIGHBORHOOD PRESENCE AND OVERALL QUALITY. I REPRESENT A GROUP OF ABOUT 50 OTHER SHORT-TERM RENTAL OWNERS IN THE CITY AND PERHAPS TO YOUR SURPRISE, WE DO NOT OPERATE OUR RENTAL PROPERTIES LIKE THE WILD, WILD WEST. THIS IS A HOME TO ME, NOT A OPERTY. ITRICTLY ENFORCE RULES, VET AND REVIEW AWFUL OF MY REPRESENTERS, NEVER ALLOW PARTIES, FOLLOW HOUSING CODE OCCUPANCY REGULATIONS AND TAKE IMMACULATE CARE OF THE INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR OF MY HOME. WHEN I PURCHASED MY HOME THERE WAS NO CITY ORDINANCE OR LAW STATING I COULDN'T RENT MY HOME ON A SHORT-TERM BASIS. THERE WAS NO DEFINITION OF SHORT-TERM RENTAL THAT EVEN EXISTED IN THE CITY. I FOLLOWED ALL THE RULES A TLINED BY THE HOUSING CODE FOR RENTAL PROPERTIES. I REMIT OCCUPANCY TAXES AND MY PROPERTY HAS BEEN THOROUGHLY INSPECTED. WHEN I BOUGHT MY HOME, THERE WAS NO LEGAL DISTINCTION BETWEEN SHORT OR LONG-TERM RENTAL. THERE WAS NO 30-DAY RULE. I HAVE BEEN OPERATING MY HOME LEGALLY ACCORDING TO THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. MY FAMILY MADE A CHOICE TO RENT OUR HOME ON A SHORT-TERM BASIS, NOTO SQUEEZE EVERY LAST DOLLAR OUT OF IT THAT WE COULD, BUT BECAUSE WE WANTED TO USE OUR HOME AS WELL. WE WANTED TO HAVE FREQUENT ACCESS TO OUR HOME AND UPGRADE AND MAIN T MAINTAIN THE PROPERTE WANT TO USE IT OURSELVES AND STAY THERE WHEN WE CHOOSE. WE RENTED OUR HOME TO SOME OF THE MOST LOVELY VISITORS TO OUR CITY, AWELL AS LAL ANN ARBOR RESIDENTS AND SHARED OUR HOME WITH THOSE WITH DIRE CIRCUMSTANCES AND HEALTH CONDITIONS.

WE ARE ASKING TO MAINTAIN THE GHHAT WEAD PRIOR TO THE DECISION. THE MICHIGAN SUPREME COURT HAS AFFIRMED OUR STANCE AND OUR WILL RIGHT AND YOU SHOULD TOO. LITIGATION IS THE ABSOLUTE LAST PATH WE WANT TO TAKE BUT WE UNDERSTAND WE NEED TO STAND UP FOR OUR RIGHTS. PLEASE SEND THIS BACK TO OUR CITY STAFF AND ALLOW THEM TO EXPLORE THE LEGAL NON-CONFORMING STATUS FOR HOME OPENERS LIKE ME. Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. CLERK CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING IN 111. CALLER 111, YOU CAN GO AHEAD.
01:04:27.317: >> YES, THIS IS -- CAN YOU HEAR ME?
01:04:29.386: >> Mayor Taylor: YOU BET WE CAN.
01:04:30.253: >> OKAY. MY NAME IS PAT LENNON. I KNOW MANY OF YOU. I'M AN ATTORNEY WITHHE NTINGTON L FIR I REPRESENT NOAH HOFFMAN AND A GROUP OF RESIDENTS THAT OPPOSED THE NEW SHORT-TERM RENTALS ORDINANCE. YOU HAVE PROBABLY HEARD MANY OF MY CLIENTS DISCUSSING TONIGHT THEIR FEELING ABOUT THE UNFAIRNESS OF THE ORDINANCE, AND HOW IT WILL, YOU KNOW, ELIMINATE AN EXISTING PERMITTED USE AND DEPRIVE THESE RESIDENTS OF A CRITICAL SOURCE OF INCOME THAT SUPPORTS THEIR FAMILY A PROPERTIES. I WON'T USE MY TIME TALKING MUCH ABOUT THAT BECAUSE I THINK THEY WILL COVER THOSE ISSUES. I WILL USE MY TIME COVERING SOME OF THE LEGAL ISSUES RELATED TO THIS ORDINANCE. FIRST, AS YOU PROBABLY SAW, I PROVIDED A LETTER DATED JULY 16th, WHICH EXPLAINS THAT THE CITY DOES NOT HAVE THE LEGAL RIGHT TO ELIMINATE AN EXISTING PROVIDING LEGAL NON-CONFORMINGM USE STATUS. IN OTHER WORDS, IF A RESIDENT HAS BEEN USING THEIR PROPERTY LAWFULLY FOR SHORT-TERM RENTALS PRIOR TO THE IMPOSITION OF THE ORDINANCE, THEY ARE LEGALLY ENTITLED TO CONTINUE TO DO SO AFTERWARD. THE MICHIGAN SUPREME COURT REINFORCED THIS PRINCIPLE WITH RESPECT TO SHORT-TERM RENTALS, IN ROOM v SING LAKE WHICH WAS DECIDED, I BELIEVE, IN JUNE. THE ROOM CASE STANDS FOR THE PROPOSITION THAT EXISTING LAWFUL SHORT-TERM PROPERTIES ARE ENTITLED TO LEGAL NON-CONFORMING STATUS, IN OTHER WORDS THEY ARE GRANDFATHERED AND CAN CONTINUE AFTER THE PASSAGE OF A NEW PROHIBIT TM.AT WOULD OTHERWISE THE CURRENT DRAFT OF THE ORDINANCE DOES NOT ALLOW THE EXISTING ORDINANCES IN SO DOING IT VIOLATES THE RIGHTS OF THOSE USES AND USERS AND ENTITLES THEM. BUT NO ONE WANTS TO GO. THIS WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE ORDINANCE MODIFIED TO CLEARLY ALAW EXISTING LAWFUL USES TO CONTINUE AFTER PASSAGE. WE HAVE HEARD THE PITIO THAT THE PROPOSED ORDINANCE IS NOT "ZONING ORDINANCE, AND THAT RIGHTS TO LEGAL NON-CONFORMING USE OR REFERENDUM WOULD APPLY. WE THINK THAT POSITION IS WITHOUT MERIT. MICHIGAN LAW IS CLEAR THAT THE ZONING ORDINANCE CANNOT BE APPLIED TO TERMINATE A VESTED LAND USE. IN THIS CASE, THE ELIMINION/RESTRICTIO ON THE USE IS DIRECTLY TIED TO THE ZONING CLASSIFICATION OF THE PROPERTY AND ALSO RELATES DIRECTLY TO A PREVIOUSLY PERMITTED USE OF THESE PROPERTIES. AS SUCH, THE SUBSTANCE OF THE RESTRICTION IS IN THE NATURE OF A ZONING ORDINANCE NOT --
01:06:59.636: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS --
01:07:00.637: >> FEDERALLY APPLIED REGULATORY ORDINANCE. WE WOULD CITE THE CASES OF AGGREGATES, NURAL AGGREGATES vs. BRIGHTON AND SQUARE LAKE HILLS FOR THE TEST THAT RELATES TO WHETHER AN ORDINANCE IS REGULATORY OR ZONING. IT'S DETERMINED BASED OPEN THE SUBSTANCE OF THE PROVISIONS AND THE TERMS OF THE ORDINANCE AND THE RELATION TO PLAN OF ZONING IN THE CITY. IN THIS CASE THE APPLICATIONABILITY OF THE SHORT-TERM RESTRICTIONS ARE BASED ON THE ZONING DISTRICT OR THE PROPERTY. UNDER THE ORDINANCE, THE SHORT-RM RENTAL CANNOT BE CONDUCTED AT ALL.
01:07:32.269: >> Clerk Beaudry: TIME.
01:07:32.936: >> IT'S ELIMINATED IN CERTAIN DISTRICTS AND THAT IS NOT PERMITTED.

01:07:50.854: >> HI, THA YOU, MAYOR TAYLOR AND CITY COUNCILMEMBERS FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TONIGHT. MY NAME IS BEN RENTA. I HAVE BEEN A LONG-TIME RESIDENT OF ANN ARBOR IN THE 5thWARD. I'M A COMBAT VETERAN A BLUE COLLAR WORKER. I INVESTED MY SAVINGS IN AFGHANISTAN TO BUY AND RENOVATE A HOME DOWN THE STREET WHERE I I EXPECT TO LIVE IN A QUIET, PEACEFUL NEIGHBORHOOD. BUT I SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO RENT OUT THIS HOME. IT'S A FALSEHOOD THAT I'M FINANCIALLY BACKED BY AIRBNB. MY AND MY COLLEAGUES' EFFORTS ARE PURELY GRASS ROOTS. I'M MOTIVATED BECAUSE I WANT TO KEEP MY FINANCIAL HEADBOVE WATER TOANG ON TO IT. THE CITY IS SIMPLY ENFORCING THE EXISTING ORDINANCE AND ZONING LANGUAGE WHY IS THERE A NEED TO DROP THE ORDINANCE IN THE FIRST PLACE? I'M FRUS FRUSTRATED THAT THE CIY COUNCIL MAKES THIS AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING ISSUE. THEY HAVE NOT COLLECTED THE IN HE IS DATA TO OBJECTIVELY VIEW THE SITUATION AS IT IS. MY BEST ESTIMATES ONLY ONE OR TWO HOME FOR EVERY THOUSAND IS A NONOWNER OCCUPIED STR IT WILL NOT NEGATIVELILY IMPACT AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN ANY MEANINGFUL WAY. THIS IS FEEL-GOOD RHETORIC, A DISTRACTION OF THE REAL ISSUE. SO FOR THE PAST FOUREA, I HAVE BEEN OBEYING ALL THE CURRENT ANN ARBOR RENTAL LAWS. SO THE REAL ISSUE HERE IS THAT MY RIGHTS TO PROPERTY OWNER ARE BEING STRIPPED AWAY AND I HAVE BEEN SAYING AND THE CITY COUNCIL ASKED FOR FEEDBACK, FOR ANY POTENTIAL SHORT-TERM RENTAL ORDINANCE. SO I USE MY MODEST SAVINGS -- THE MODEST SAVINGS WHILE IN GHANISTAN TO PURCHASE AND RENOVATE A HOME IN NASH. -- ANN ARBOR.IT'S AI VIOLATIONS THAT I HAVE BEEN DOING LEGALLY FOR PAST FOUR YEAR IS A VIOLATION. CITY ORDINANCE. I REFUSE THAT IN ANN ARBOR, A PROGRESS ENVIRONMENT AND WELL-EDUCATED CITY. A PROVISION CANNOT BE MADE FOR THOSE WHO WILL BE FINANALLY CUT F AT THE KNEES. THE RIGHT ACTION TO TAKE IS TO AMEND THIS ORDINANCE. SHOW US THAT YOU ARE LISTENING TO OUR CONCERNS. I'M ASKING SOMEONE ON COUNCIL TO STAND UP. DON'T ALLOW YOURSELF TO BE BULLIED IN SILENCE AND PROPOSE AN AMENDMENT TO THIS ORDINANCE TO ALLOW FOR NON-CONFORMING USE STATUS FOR NONRESIDENT OWNER OCCUPIED STRs.

01:10:26.476: >> EVERYONE ON COUNCIL HAS SHOWN THAT THEY ARE CIVIC LEADERS WHO SERVED THE CITY HONORABLY. I'M PROUD TO BE AN ANN ARBORRITE. I ASK YOU TO PUT YOURSELF IN MY SHOES AND CONSIDER THE IMPACT ON ME AND MY FAMILY,LL S OWNERS INCLUDED. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION.

01:10:57.507: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER ENDING IN THE PHONE NUMBER 520.
01:11:03.613: >> GOOD EVENING. MY NAME IS PAUL CAL LUMM. I'M REPRESENTING PRENTICE PARTNERS. IT'S A REAL ESTATE MANAGEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT COMPANY BASED IN ANN ARBOR WITH A PORTFOLIO THAT INCLUDES BOTH LONG AND SHORT-TERM RENTALS. BECAUSE THE PROPOSED STR ORDINANCE WOULD BAN CURRENT LAWFUL, CITY-SANCTIONED RENTALS. WE CONSIDER IT UNFAIR AND ILLEGAL. I THINK THE UNFAIRNESS ISSUE IS OBVIOUS AS MANY SPEAKERS HAVE ALREADY ADDRESSED. I WOULD LIKE TO FOCUS MY COMMENTS ON THE LEGAL ISSUES ADID MR. LENNON. BOTH THE ZONING ENABLING ACT AND THE MICHIGAN SUPREME COURT PRECEDENT MADE CLEAR THAT USE OF THE DWELLING AND LAND THAT IS LAWFUL AT THE TIME OF ENAMENT OFHE ZONING ORDINANCE MAY CONTINUE ALTHOUGH THE USE DOES NOT PRECISELY CONFORM TO THE NEW ORDINANCE. PREPRENTICE'S STR PROPERTIES ARE OPERATING LAWFULLY AND CURRENT ZONING DOES NOT PROHIBIT THEIR OPERATION. PRESEPRENTICE HAS REGISRED EACHF E PROPERTIES WITH THE CITY AND INSPECTED AND HOLD CERTIFICATES OF COMPLIAN ISSUED BY THE CITY. THE PROPOSED STR ORDINANCE MAKES NO ALLOWANCE FOR THE CONTINUED OPERATION OF THESE AND SIMILARLY SITUATED REGISTERED NONOWNER OCCUPIED RENTALS IN RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS. WE ESTIMATE THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY 120 OF SUCH PROPERTIES IN THE CITY CURRENTLY. MR. DELACOURT, COMMUNITY SERVICES AREA ADMINISTRATOR HAS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THESE USES WOULD BE BANNED UNDER THE PROPOSED ORDINANCE AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN. BUT HE HAS ARGUED THE THAT THE ORDINANCES, IS A REGULATORY MATTER AND NOT A ZONING ORDINANCE, THAT RENTALS OF MORE THAN 30 DAYS ARE ALLOWED AND SO HE ARGUES RENL USEAS NOT BEEN BANNED. I HOPE THE CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE HAS DISABUSED COUNCIL OF THIS NOTION BECAUSE IT IS NOT THE LA YOU. CASE LAW REFERS TO SUCH ARGUMENTS AS DISGUISED ZONING AND COURTS HAVE REJECTED IT AS IMPERMISSIBLE AND IMPERMESSIBLE END AROUND, IF YOU WILL OF NON-CONFORMING USE RIGHTS WHEREAS HERE,HE PROPOSE ORDINANCE REGULATES ACTIVITIES BY LOCATION. THE CITY'S PROPOSED STR ORDINANCE HAS NONOWNER OCCUPIED RENTALS IN RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS. IT MANDATES A FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE IN CURRENT USE OF A SMALL SET OF PROPERTIES BASED ON THEIR LOCATION.
01:13:38.434: >> UESSHE CITY EXPRESSLY. EXEMPTS CURRENT LAWFUL USE, THEY WILL SEEK REDRESS IN THE COURTS. MIFF CLIENMY CLIENT IS HERE IN , TO AVOID LITIGATION. WE ARE NOT HERE THAT TO ARGUE THAT THE ENTIRE ORDINANCE BE SCPPED. WE HE THAT THE COUNCIL THE RECOGNIZE THAT THE ORDINANCE IS FLAWED AND THERE ARE WORKABLE SOLUSOLUTIONS AND HAVE LAWFUL NON-CONFORMING USES. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.
01:14:14.504: >> Clerk Beaudry: TIME.

01:14:25.181: >> HELLO. THIS IS ZACHARY I'M AT 551 SOUTH 4th AVENUE, AND WE'RE STILL IN A PANDEMIC, AND THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE HOMES, AND A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO NUMBER ONE WORRIES ARE BEING EVICTED, AND FROM HEARING THAT THERE'S ONLY 120 OF THESE UNITS THAT ARE BEING OPERATED AS NONOWNER OCCUPIED, SHORT-TERM RENTALS, THAT'S 120 FAMILIES OF ESSENTIAL WORKERS WHO CAN'T LIVE IN THE COMMUNITY. SO, YOU KNOW, OWNERS -- GOOD JOB THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO BUY ADDITIONAL HOUSES. IF YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR INVESTMENT, CONVERT IT INTO A LONG-TERM RENTAL AND GIVE SOMEBODY ALACE TO LIVE. IT MIGHT BE A BETTER INVESTMENT FOR YOU AS WELL, BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE SEEKING SHORT-TERM RENTALS ONCE ALL THE CASES AND DEATHS START TO INCREASE AND WE NEED TO PPT -- TOUPPORT EACHOMMUNITY TO OTHER. SO REALLY, 120 UNITS IS A BIG NUMBER TO ME AND IT'S A BIG NUMBER TO EVERY SINGLE FAMILY OR INDIVIDUAL WHO WOULD BE ABLE TO FIND PERMANENT RESIDENCE IN THE CITYND CONTRIBUTE AS WORKERS IN THE CITY THAT WE DEEM ESSENTIAL WITH OUR SIGNS OUTSIDE OF OUR LAWNS. WE BUILT SO MANY HOTELS IN THE CITY DOWNTOWN IN SPOTS THAT COULD HAVE BEEN USED FOR APARTMENT BUILDINGS. AND YOU KNOW, YOU ALL KNOW THE NUMBERS OF WHAT COUNCIL HAS FAILED TO PRODUCE IN THE PROPERTY. OF HOW MANY HOUSING UNITS WE NEED PER YEAR SINCE 2015 OR SOMETHING. WE NEED TO LOOK AT THIS PROBLEM FROM ALL ANGLES THAT WE CAN AND 120 UNITS IS 120NITS.
01:16:56.799: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
01:16:57.967: >> AND THAT'S A BIG NUMBER FOR ME. YEAH, I'M REALLY NOT BUYING THE ARGUMENT FROM OWNERS THAT HAVE AN EXTRA HOUSE AVAILABLE THAT THEY COULD RENT OUT ANOTHER WAY, AND HELP A FAMILY IN NEED. SO I JUST ASK THOSE OWNERO BE A LITTLE LET GREEDY, AND HAVE RENTING YOUR HOUSE TO SOMEONE WOULD WOULD LIKE TO MOVE INTO YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD AND YOU WILL HAVE AN EXTRA NEIGHBOR. THANK YOU.

01:17:41.444: >> HI, MY NAME IS BRIDGET O'CONNOR. I HAVE BEEN A RESIDENT SINCE 2004 AND NOW LIVE IN THE FIFTH WARD. AT LAST MONTH'S CITY COUNCIL MEETING THERE WAS A COMMITMENT MADE BY A CITY OFFICIAL TO REMOVE THE DISCRIMINATORY LANGUAGE IN THE SHORT-TERM RENTAL, MAINTAINING NEIGHBOR AND COMMUNITY CHACTER. I'M DISHEARTENED TO SEE THAT THIS REMA REMAINS IN THE PHENOLT OF THE ORDINANCE. WHEN WE CONSIDER A MAJORITY AFFLUENT COMMUNITY, THIS CAN ONLY BE SEEN AS RACIAL UNDERTONED. I HAVE WITNESSED ALL OF YOU CITY COCIL, THE BCK LIVES MATTERS IS PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS WHICH MEANS THAT RECOGNIZING DISCRIMINATION WOULD BE APRIL OPERATIONAL PRIORITY. I THAT ORDINANCE IS NOT IN MY MEANS IN THE LAST TO ENSURING EQUALITY BUT AS THIS ORDINANCE IS WRITTEN CURRENTLY, IT'S ESSENTIALLY A FORM OF RED LINING. A LARGE NUMBER ARE MEMBERS OF COLOR AND BY LIMITING STR TO CERTAIN AREAS YOU ARE DENYING ACCESS TO THE TSE. THEY SAID GUESTS CAN STAY IN A HOTEL. IN 2015, THERE WERE MORE THAN 2 MILLION LISTINGS OFFERED ON AIRBNB NATIONALLY WHICH IS FOUR TIMES AS MANY ROOMS AT MARRIOTT HOTEL CHANGE. IT WOULD REDUCE THE AVAILABILITY OF PLACES FOR FUREUESTS TO STAY AND THE ECONOMIC TOURISM THAT THE CITY REPLIES ON. HOTELS ARE MORE EXPENSIVE PER NIGHT THAN AN STR. IF THIS ORDINANCE IS AN ISSUE, YOU WOULD VOTE TO SUPPORT IN YOUR OWN TOWN, I WOULD THEN ASSUME YOU WOULD ALSO CHOOSE TO NEVER STAY AT A NOWR OCCUPIED STR, BECAUSE OTHERWISE THIS IS HYPOCRITICAL AND CREATES A NOT IN MY BACKYARD SITUATION, WHICH, AGAIN IS DISCRIMINATORY. I WHOLEHEARTEDLY SUPPORT THE INITIATIVE TO CREATE MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE CITY. I ALSO STRONGLY SUPPORT ORDINANCES THAT ENSURE THE, QUOTE, HEALTH, SAFETY, AND WELFARE BY REAFFIRMING POLICE, FIRE AND BUILDING SAFETY GUIDELINES UP QUOTE. IUEION HOW THE CURRENT STRs ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THESE ISSUES. I SEE A MORE REASONABLE AHOPE TOON SURE THE CITY IS NOT TAKEN OVER BY OUTSIDE INVESTORS WOULD BE TO SET LIMITS ON THE NUMBER OF STRs. HAVING RESIDENTS UNDERGO REGULAR INSPECTION AND LICENSING FOR THE USE OF STRs TO MAKE SURE IT'S MEETING ALL CITYODES. HAVE BEEN A RENTER OF A NUMBER OF HOMES IN ANN ARBOR THAT DID NOT MEET CODE. IF A RESIDENT IS LIVING IN A HOME, IT WOULD BE SAFE, DOES NOT ACTUALLY PROTECT ANY FUTURE GAP. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO CREATE STRICT POLICIES TO REMOVE LICENSES FROM STR OWNERS WHO VIOLATE HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS OR FOUND TO BE A CREDIBLE NUISANCE TO THEIR NEIGHBORS. IF THEY WANT TO ADDRESS GUESTS OF THE CITY, YOU YOU AND THE CITY STAFF NEEDS TO REVIEW THIS IS WRITTEN AS CURRENTLY DISCRIMINATORY AND FIND MORE APPROPRIATE WAYS TO ENFORCE SUCH A POLICY.
01:20:48.297: >> Clerk Beaudry: TIME.

01:21:06.282: >> THIS IS BETH CORY. I'M SUN WHO MOVED TO ANN ARBOR TO MAKE A CAREER SERVING AS A CONCIERGE. THIS IS MY FULL-TIME JOB THAT I'M NOW IN JEOPARDY OF LOSING. WE SERVE PARENTS AND BUSINESS PEOPLE. DURING THE SHUTDOWN, WE PROVIDED HOUSES FOR MANY ESSENTIAL MEDICAL WORKERS WHO WERE VERY GREAT FULL TO US I'M CONFUSED AS TO WHY THE CITY COUNCIL THINKS OUR SERVICE TO ALL OF THESE PEOPLE IS A BAD THING. WE'RE PROVIDING A REAL NEED FOR OUR CUSTOMERS WHO RETURN TO US TIME AND AGAIN BECAUSE OF THE GREAT RELATIONSHIPS THAT WE HAVE BUILT WITH THEM. IN CLOSING ALL I CAN ASK IS PLEASE MOVE TO SEND THIS ORDINANCE BACK TO CITY IF A STAFF FOR THE PURPOSE OF EXEMPTING LEGAL OPERATING SHORT-TERM RENTALS PROPERTIES FROM THIS ORDINANCE. THANK YOU.
01:22:13.783: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER WITH PHONE NUMBER 900.
01:22:17.620: >> HI, ADAM HUGHES, 1328 WHITE STREET. SUPERIMPOSING THIS ON THOSE OPERATING IN THE SHORT-TERM RENTAL MODEL IS A DIRECT VIOLATION OF OUR PROPERTY RIGHTS. THEY BROUGHT TO LIGHT THE CHARACTER NEIGHBORHOODS. ISN'T THAT WHAT MAKES IT SO GREAT, THE FACT THAT THE MUNICIPALITY CANNOT CONTROL EVERY SINGLE ASPECT OF THEM. REGULATE, SUR BUT CONTROL THEM, NO. IMAGINE I'M A RESTAURANT OWNER. THINGS GET OFF THE GROUND. HUMMUS IS FLYING OFF THE SHELF AND THEN THE HOLE MUNICIPALITY GETS INVOLVED AND DICTATES WHAT TYPES OF FOODS I CAN AND WHAT I CAN'T. CERTAIN TYPES OF FOOD THAT SUPPORT OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD ARE ALL RIGHT OUT BUT OTHER TYPES OF FOOD THAT DON'T ARE NOT. THIS WOULD BE RIDICULOUS, RIG? I DON'T SEE THAT BIG OF A DIFFERENCE WHEN MEASURING IT AGAINST THIS PROPOSED ORDINANCE. PERHAPS IT MAKES SENSE FOR THE MUNICIPALITY TO PUT PUBLISHED LEGISLATION TO THE TUNE OF NO LONGER ALLOWING A CERTAIN KIND OF FOOD TO BE SERVED TO THE PUBLIC. WHERE DOES THIS LEAVE THE PREEXISTING RESTAURANTS THAT HAVE BUILT TEAMS AND SUPPORT THIS TYPE OF NEWLY OUTLAWED FOOD. THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE OVERREACH OF POWER AND INFRINGEMENT OF FREEDOM OF CHOICE. AS A COLLECTIVE, THE SHORT-TERM RENTAL OWNERS HAVE GONE ABOVE AND BEYOND IN AN ATTEMPT TO WORK WITH AND NOT AGAINST THE CITY TO DEVELOP A CERTAIN PROCESS SO THAT EVERYONE CAN BE COMFORTABLE THAT PROPERTY OWNERS ARE PAYING BY THE RULES AND NEIGHBORS SHORT-TERM RENTALS.ED BY CITY STAFF, NAMELY MR. DELACOURT, THEY DON'T SEE WHAT ELSE COULD BE ACCOMPLISHED BY GOING BACK TO THE PUBLIC TO FIGURE THIS OUT. THEY CLAIM THEY HAVE SPOKEN WITH EVERYONE POSSIBLE ABOUT THIS ISSUE. THAT MAY BE TRUE, BUT SPEAKING WITH PEOPLE, VERSUS SITTING DOWN AND ACTUALLY TAKING A COLLABORATIVE SWING AT PROBLEM SOLVING ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS. HAVE YOU GONE THROUGH THE MOTIONS AN LISTED? PERHAP HAVE YOU DUG IN AND ATTEMPTED TO FIND A MIDDLE GROUND? ABSOLUTELY NOT. I EMIF A T EMPATHIZE WITH YOUR . I DON'T THINK THIS IS AN EASY TASK BEING OR SOMETHING THAT CAN BE PAIN-FREE. YOU CHOSE A CAREER TO BE A PUBLIC SERVANT AND ENHANCE THE CITY FOR EVERYONE. ON THIS ATTEMPT YOU AND YOUR CONSTITUENTS HAVE FAILED THE PEOPLE OF ANN ARBOR GREATLY. AT THE VERY LEAST, I URGE THAT YOU SEND THIS BACK TO CITY STAFF FOR TO ELIMINATE THE SHORT-TERM RENTALS PROPERTY OWNERS FROM THIS ORDINANCE. THANK YOU.
01:24:54.443: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK Y.

01:25:13.662: >> MY NAME IS ALEX I'M A RENTER IN THE FIFTH WARD. I WANT TO BRI THIS POINT -- THIS IS LIKE A SECOND INVEST -- I SPENT THE LAST TWO AND A HALF YEARS HELPING WITH GUEST COMMUNITY, CLEANING, MAINTENANCE, KIND OF ALL THE SMALL COMPONENTS INVOLVED AND I'M SPEAKING FOR MYSELF, I HAVE THREE PART-TIME CLEANERS AND ONE PART-TIME HANDYMAN AND IF YOU PASS THIS ORDINANCE, IN THE CURRENT FORM, BASICALLY OVERNIGHT, YOU WILL DESTROY THE LIVELIHOOD FOR ALL OF US. THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO THIS IS NOT JUST IN TERMS OF SWITCHING TO AN INVESTMENT, INVESTMENT TO INVESTMENT BUT ARE THE LIVELIHOODS -- THAT THEY ARE LIVING OFF OF. SO -- AND I THINK THERE'S A MISCONCEPT OF A FEW PEOPLE EARLIER HAVE TALKED TO THIS POINT THAT YOU CAN SIMPLY SWITCH AN STR TO A LONG-TERM RENTAL. THAT'S JUST NOT THE CASE. YOU -- YEAH, BOTH INVEST THE TIME AND MONEY TO MAKE THESE PROPERTIES NICER AND BENEFITS TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD, BUT ALSO IN FURNITURE, AND IN THE PROCESSES OF BRINGING SOMEO LIKE USN HELP YOU WITH THE CLEANING AND THE MAINTENANCE AND THOSE ARE NOT THINGS THAT JUST KIND OF GO AWAY. AND THEN JUST IMPERIAL LOGISTIC FIRM. ANN ARBOR RUNS ON AUGUST TO AUGUST RENTAL CYCLES. THE TIMING COULD NOT BE WORSE TO SWITCH THIS TO A LONG-TERM RENTAL. ESSENTIALL YOU ARE RNING A HIGHISK THAT YOU WILL GO UNRENTED FOR AN ENTIRE YEAR. I THINK THAT'S A PRETTY UP FAIR THING TO PUT ON A PROPERTY OWNER. SO IT'S NOT JUST A MATTER OF FLIPPING A SWITCH AND TURNING IT FROM A SHORT-TERM RENTAL TO A LONG-TERM RENTAL. I THINK PEOPLE IN THE INDUSTRY REALLY UNDERSTAND THAT. AND SO YEAH, AGAIN, I WANTED TO SPEATO THE FACT THAT WN WE STARTED -- WHEN I STARTED WORKING IN THIS BUSINESS, I DID SOME RESEARCH BEFORE DIVING INTO IT AND FOUND THERE WERE NO RULES ON THE BOOKS ABOUT SHORT-TERM RENTAL THAT WOULD MAKE IT ILLEGAL. AND OVERNIGHT THE T COUNCIL IS SAYING WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN DOING IS ILLEG AND WE WILL SHUT YOU SU DOWN. I ASK THAT THE COUNCIL CONSIDER THE NON-CONFORMING STATUS AND TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE PEOPLE ON THE GROUND, THE MAINTENANCE PEOPLE, THE CLEANERS, THE PEOPLE HELPING WITH GUEST COMMUNICATION AND ALL OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO BE SERIOUSLY AFFECTED BY THIS IF IT GOES THROUGH IN THE CURRENT FORM AGAIN. LIKE TWO AND A HALF YEARS THAT SOMEONE MENTIONED EARLIER, BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS GOING INTO THIS. IT'S ALL GOING OUT THE WINDOW IF IT PASSES IN ITS CURRENT FORM. I WOULD LIKE TO END BY THANKING THE COUNCIL FOR CONSIDERING AN EXEMPTION FOR SHT-TERM RENTALS D ASK THAT IT BE SENT BACK FOR NON-CONFORMING STATUS.

AFTERWARDS, I WAS BASICALLY ATTACKED ONLINE BY A LOT OF THESE SHORT-TERM RENTAL OWNERS AS A MONEY GRUBBER, EVEN THOUGH I NEVER FILED A CIVIL SUIT OR APPROACHED A LAWYER ABOUT THE INCIDENT. AND A LIAR AND SOMETHING BAD FOR SLAP AND GET OR IT.ST AN AS S PLEASE NOTE THAT I'M NOT SCARED OF TH THESE INDIVIDUALS AND I WL NOT STOP SPEAKING OUT ABOUT SEXUAL ASSAULT AND MISOGYNY. AND THESE SAME PEOPLE WHO TRY TO TARNISH ME AND MY FAMILY MEMBERS, ARE TRYING TO GET SPECIAL PRIVILEGES TO GET THEIR SHORT-TERM RENTALS THROUGH A I'M VERY UPSET.GRANDFATHERED I THIS IS THE EPITOME OF THE CONCIERGE SERVICE, WHICH WAS SO ROUNDLY REJECTED BY THE VOTERS. I COULD AGREE COMPLETELY WITH ZACHARY THAT THERE IS A HUGE AND THESE PEOPLE W HAVE AA, MULTIPLE HOUSES, MULTIPLE APARTMENTS THAT THEY ARE USING JUST FOR TOURISTS, I -- IT JUST MAKES ME ANGRY QUITE FRANKLY. THERE ARE BEING EVICTED. AND THICANWITCHED OVER TO A LONG-TERM RENTAL THAT CAN BE SOLD. THE USE REGULATIONS HAVE BEEN GOING UP IN NEW YORK, IN SAN FRANCISCO. IF YOU HAVE INVESTED IN THIS BUSINESS MODEL, AND YOU ARE SURPRISED BY THE CITY PUTTING IN THESE REGULATIONS THEN I'M SORRY THAT YOU WERE NOT SMART ENOUGH TO SEE THE WRITING ON THE WALL. I'M DEV VERY DISAPPOINTED. THEY BULLY ONLINE AND IN MEETINGS AND WE SHOULD TAKE IT BACK TO THE PUBLIC AND DO ALL OF THAT. I WAS AT THE LIBRARY MEETINGS WHERE I WAS ROUTINELY OVERAND -- VOICE HEARD. COU NOT GET MY THE ONLY TIME I HAD MY VOICE HEARD IS WHEN I CALLED INTO COUNCIL. LISTEN TO YOUR STAFF AND PASS THE ORDINANCE. THIS WILL HELP SOME PEOPLE LOWER PRICES. MY NEIGHBORHOOD, WE HAVE SHORT-TERM RTALS IN OUR NEIGHBHOOD THATERE UP FOR SALE AT ONE POINT FOR $800,000. I PAID LESS THAN HALF OF THAT FOR MY HOUSE SEVEN YEARS AGO. IT'S INSANE HOW MUCH PRICES HAVE GONE UP. I'M DOP DONE.

01:31:36.011: >> HI, RALPH MCKEE, 1116 RED OAK. SINCE I HAVE BEEN CRITICAL OF PLANNING STAFF ON OTHER MATTERS, I WANTED TO CTA START OUT BY SAG THE DRAFT ORDINANCE IS WELL THOUGHT OUTEN WELL DONE. I SENT AN EMAIL TODAY IN SUPPORT. IN TMS OF THE SUBSTANCE IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE. WE DO HAVE AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS AND EVERY SINGLE STR IS ONE LESS HOUSE. THERE'S DOZENS ARE HUNDREDS OF THEM. I BELIEVE THERE'S SOME CORPORATE SHORT-TERM RENTALS THAT AREN'T IN THE 120 NUMBER THAT I HEARD OF SEVERAL TIMES TONIGHT AND I THINK THE NUMBER MIGHT BE QUITE A BIT BIGGER. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE SUPPORTED AFOR THIBLE HOUSING ON COUNCIL, IT'S INCONCEIVABLE TO ME THAT ANY OF YOU WOULD MOTT NOT SUPPORT THIS. THE NUMBERS HERE MAY BE MORE THAN YOU GAIN IF THE MILLAGE PASSES IN THE FIRST YEAR OR TWO AND I'M PRETTY SURPRISED AT NOT HEARING FROM THE USUAL CADRE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING ADVOCATES. THIS IS AS IMPORTANT AS ANY OTHER AFFORDABLE HOUSING ISSUES AND WE HAVE NOT HEARD FROM ANY OF THEM TONIGHT, YET HERE'S A PROGRAM THAT IT WILL AT MINIMUM STOP EROSION OF OUR HOUSING STOCK AND LIKELY THE RETURN OF MANY UNITS AND WHERE ARE THEY? THE SILENCE IS DEAFENING. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE LEGAL ISSUES I'M NOT A MAVEN IN THIS ARENA, BUT I DID A LITTLE HOMEWORK IN MY ETAIL TODAY THAT I SENT TODAY DESCRIBED THAT. IT I VERYMPORTANT TO SEPARATE OUT THE QUESTIONS WHETHER TO ENACT THE ORDER THAT ON AND WHETHER TO GRANDFATHER PEOPLE IN. THOSE ARE RELATED QUESTIONS BUT THEY ARE SEPARATE CHOICES. IF YOU BAN NEW STRs AND GRANDFATHER THE OLD ONES IN, YOU ARE CAPPING THE NUMBER AND GIVING THE CURRENT OPERATO A COMPLETE MINORITY, A CASH COW, ESSENTIALLY. IF YOU DON'T GRANDFATHER THEM IN, YOU COULD POTENTIALLY BE ADDING UNITS BACK INTO THE HOUSING STOCK. I READ THE LAWYER FROM THE FROM THE STR OWNERS AND THE OTHER ARGUMENTS. I HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT FOR THAT FIRM. ISED TO WORK TRE YEARS AGO. THERE ARE TWO ARGUMENTS. THE FIRST IS THE CITY'S -- THIS THEY ARE ARGUING THAT'S THE CITY'S FAILURE TO ENFORCE THE OLD OR NANCE RESULTS AUTOMATICAL -- ORDINANCE RESULTS IN A LEGAL NON-CONFORMING USE. INHEASEHAT TY SITED. ROOM. THE TOWNSHIP OFFICIAL SAID THAT OWNER STRs WERE OKAY AND THEY RULED FOR THE TOWNSHIP. THE SECOND ARGUMENT IS REALLY A FUNCTION OF WHETHER THEY ARE LEGAL UNDER THE CURRENT ORDINANCE, NOT THE TACT THAT THE ORDINANCE HAS NOT BEEN FORCED. THAT'S A MORE COMPLICATED IUE. YOU CAN ENACT THIS ORDER ORDINAD DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO GRANDFATHER THEM IN. YOU DON'T HAVE TO DECIDE THAT TONIGHT. YOU CAN STUDY IT AND NEGOTIATE WITH THEM LATER AFTER ENACTING THE IN  ORDINANCE.

EYE CALLING TO SUPPORT -- DOPPLER RADAR ANYTHING LIKE THIS. -- DONE ANYTNG LE THIS. I LIVED ACROSS STREET FROM AN EYE SORE AND SOMEONE BOUGHT IT AND FIXED IT UP AND IT'S NOW THE NICEST PLACE ON THE BLOCK, AND SO, YOU KNOW, THEY PAY CITY TAXES AND THE PERSON PREVIOUSLY WHO OWNED IT LOST THE HOUSE BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T PAY THEIR TAXES. AND I PAY MY CITY TAXES. AND I ARECIATE PEOPLE WHO KEEP UP THEIR HOME, WHO PAY THEIR TAXES ESPECIALLY WHEN PFIZER MOVED OUT AND WE ALL NEED CITY TAXES, RIGHT? WE ALL NEED PEOPLE WHO ARE PAYING THEIR TAXES. SO THERE ARE QUITE A FEW OF NON-STR OWNERS WHO BOUGHT HOUSES LIKE ACROSS THE STREET FROM MY HOUSE. THERE ARE PROBABLY QUITE A FEW PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO NOW LIVE ACROSS FROM A BEAUTIFUL HOME, AND A TAXPAYER IS THERE NOW. I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT. I SUPPORT AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND BUT I THINK PENALIZING PEOPLE WHO IMPROVE THE NEIGHBORHOOD FLAVOR -- I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU ARE CALLING IT, BUT PEOPLE WHO ARE IMPROVING -- YOU KNOW, UPKEEPING -- OR KEA KEEPING UP R HOMES AND WHETHER THEY RENT IT OUT OR NOT, BUT THE GENTLEMAN ACROSS FROM ME WHO RENTS IT OUT, WE NEVER, EVER, EVER, HAD A PROBLEM WITH HIS RENTERS. AS A MATTER OF FACT, WE DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS AN AIRBNB OWNER! AND SO, YOU KNOW, THE PEOPL WHO -- NOW WE REALIZE. WE THOUGHT THEY WERE HIS FRIENDS. THEY ARE QUIET. THEY GO ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS.

I SUPPORTH-2 AS WRITTEN. AS ZACK NOTED A FEW CALLS AGO, 120 UNITS ADDED TO THE MARKET OF RENTAL PROPERTY WOULD BE THREE TIMES WHAT HAS BEEN ADDED SINCE THE 2015 REPORT ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE COUNTY WAS ADOPTED BY THE CITY. THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT THESE UNITS WOU BE CONRTED IN WHAT COULD BE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IF I DO THE MATH RIGHT, IF THEY ARE RENTING OUT FOR $200 A NIGHT OVER THE COURSE OF 30 DAYS IN A MONTH, WITH SOME VACANCY IN THERE, THEY ARE PRO PROBABLY MAG INCOMES ON THESE PROPERTIES FAR HIGHER THAN WHAT WOULD NEED TO BE CHARGED FOR AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNIT BUT THAT'S STILL RENTAL PROPERTIES AVAILABLE IN THE MARKEHAT TY COULD RENT AT SOME RATE OR THEY COULD SELL TO FAMILIES WHO WANT TO MOVE INTO THE NEIGHBORHOOD. I THINK CITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAVE SEEN ISSUES WITH AIRBNB LIKE PROPERTIES AND I THINK THAT AIRBNB LEVERAGED A VERY GRAY AREA IN SORT OF THE LEGALITY OF THIS. I UNDERSTAND PEOPLE'S FRUSTRATION BUT I SUPPORT THE CITY IN TIGHTENING UP THE LAWS HERE, AND WE DON'T HAVE THE SITUATION WHERE FULL NEIGHBORHOODS ARE PRICED OUT AND CERTAIN THAT NEIGHBORHOODS THAT COULD FREE UP DOUBLE DOWN ON SHORT-TERM RENTALS THAT COULD HAPPEN IF FAMIES WEROVING OUT OF THE AREA LIKE BURNS PARK.

01:40:40.822: >> ALL RIGHT. I WILL KEEP THIS SHORT. I THINK THE BILL NEEDS TO BE SENT BACK. I'M A PROPERTY OWNER, AND I'M ALSO A RESIDENT OF ANN ARBOR. I LIVED IN MY HOME FOR SEVEN YEARS. WE HAD TO MOVE DUE T I AOWING FAMILY. WE LOVE THE HOUSE AND WE WANT TO KEEP IT. WE HAVE AGING IN-LAWS, AND IN FIVE TO SIX YEARS THEY WILL NEED TO MOVE CLOSE TO US. I WANT TO KEEP THAT HOUSE AS A SHORT-TERM RENTAL IN THE MEANTIME AND I CAN RECOUP COSTS UNTIL THEY MOVE INTO IT. WITH THIS NEW LAW, I'M OUTSIDE E ZE, AND HE WON'T BE ABLE TO DO THAT. AND I HEARD CALLERS TALK ABOUT LONG-TERM OWNERS. I WALK DOWN THE STREET WHERE THE STUDENTS LIVE AND THEY TRASH THESE TABLES. BEER PONG TABLES AND SHOES HANGING FROM THE WIRES. I DON'T WANT MY HOUSE TO BE THAT. SI.ON'T WANT TO HAVE A RENL I TE YOU WHEN YOU ARE A PROPERTY OWNER, YOU HAVE TO TAKE GOOD CARE OF THESE PROPERTIES. PEOPLE WON'T STAY THERE! MY LAWN IS METICULOUSLY TAKEN CARE OF, THERE'S SHRUBS AND GARDENS. PEOPLE WILL GIVE YOU BAD REVIEWS. YOU CAN'T COMPETE IF YOU DON'T DO THAT. GETTING BACK TO SOME OTHER THINGS WHY DON'T PEOPLE JUS STAY AT HOTELS? WELL, DURING THE COVID CRISIS, PEOPLE WANTED TO STAY IN HOUSES. THEY WANTED TO BE SEPARATE. THEY WANTED TO KNOW THEY HAD A CLEAN ENVIRONMENT WHERE THEY ARE NOT GOING TO INTERACT WITH OTHER PEOPLE. GETTING BACK TO THE LAIDY WHO THE UNFORTUNATE INTEREST, THAT COULD HAPPEN WITH ANYBODY. IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH A SHORT-TERM RENTER BEING IN THERE OR SOMEONE STAYING AT A HOTEL COULD HAVE DONE THAT. I THINK THIS BILL REALLY NEEDS TO BE SENT BACK OR GIVE THE PROPERTY OWNERS A GRANDFATHER WHICH CLAUSE AND THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

FIRST OF ALL, I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS A CPLE O POINT THAT HAVE BN BROUGHT UP. THERE'S NO AIRBNB MONEY BEHIND OUR GROUP. WE ARE STRICTLY A GRASS ROOTS DEGREE UP AND MOST OF US MET FOR THE FIRST TIME AT THE MEETINGS THAT COUNCIL HAD WHEN THEY STARTED THIS WHOLE PROCESS? OCTOBER. I STILL PERSONALLY HAVE A HARD TIME UNDERSTANDING WHY COUNCIL IS FOCUSED ON SHORT-TERM RENTALS VERSUS LONG-TERM RENTALS. TSO MANY OF US HAVE UPGRADED OUR PROPERTIES OUR RENTERS ARE VETTED BETTER THAN STUDENTS. I PAY EXTRA TAXES. THERE ARE NO RULES IN PLACE DIFFERENTIATING WHEN I BOUGHT MY HOUSE FROM ANY OTHER RENTAL HOUSE IN THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. I HAVE BEEN OPERATING LEGALLY D I TOO ASK COUNCIL SEND THIS BACK TO CLASS TO CREATE A CLAUSE TO GRANDFATHER IN EXISTING PROPERTIES. I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS THE POINT ABOUT BEING THAT THOUGH OF US WHO ARE NONOWNER OCCUPIED SHORT-TERM RENTALS ARE GREEDY. I KNOW THE PROPERTY I BOUGHT WAS IN HORRIBLE CONDITION WHEN I THEY HADN' HAD STUDENTED IN THERE FOR A YEAR AND -- STUDENTS IN THIS FOR A YEAR AND I DON'T THINK ANYBODY HAD INVESTED IN THE PROPERTY IN WELL OVER 30 YEARS. I PUT A LOT OF TIME AND MONEY IN THERE. FOR THOSE WHO TAKE IT'S MOTIVATED BY GREED, IT'S MORE MOTIVATED BY LOVING TO FIND GREAT HOUSES AND RESTORE THEM BACK TO THE SHAPE THAT THEY USED TO BE AND HAVE PEOPLE IN UP TO WHO CAN ARECIATE I AND ENJOY IT. I KNOW THE MONEY I PERSONALLY HAVE INVESTED, IT WILL TAKE WELL OVER 10 TO 15 YEARS TO MAKE BACK THAT INVESTMENT. IT WAS NOT MOTIVATED BY GREED BUT MY LOVE OF ANN ARBOR AND WANTING TO HAVE A FUN PLACE THAT I CAN ENJOY IMPROVING FOR THE COMMUNITY. THANK YOU.

ONE HAS TO DO WITH -- IN THE QUESTION AND ANSWEROCUMENT THAT WAS ST BACK TO STAFF OR TO COUNCILMEMBERS IN TERMS OF THEIR QUESTIONS, THE RESPONSE TO THE LICENSING FEE WAS A QUOTE THAT STARTED ABOUT $500. AND I'M REALLY SURPRISED AT. WHEN I CHECKED THE REGISTRATION FORM FOR A LONG-TERM RENTAL I DIDN'T SEE A FEE LISTED. I WOULD LIKE TO SUGGEST THAT IF THERE'S A REGISTRATION FEE FOR A RENTAL, WHETHER IT'S LONG-TERM OR SHORT-TERM, IT SHOULD BE THE SAME AND IT SHOULDN'T BE $500. I DON'T THINK IT'S $500 TO ADD 100 MORE HOUSES TO YOUR RENTAL STOCK. AND THEN M SECOND COMMENT AS A COUNCIL, YOU ALL APPROVED A DEVELOPMENT PROPOSAL UNDER THE OLD RULES AS COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, IT WOULD NOT BE FAIR TO HOLD THE DEVELOPER TO THE NEW RULES WHEN THEY APPLIED UNDER THE OLD RULES. I THINK THE SAME PROCESS SHOULD PLY HE. THESE ORT-TERM RENTAL OWNERS FOLLOWED THE RULES AT THE TIME THAT THEY STARTED AND THE RULES THAT WERE IN PLACE, AND NOW YOU ARE PLANNING TO RETROSPECTIVELY APPLY NEW RULES AND IT'S INTERESTING TO ME THAT YOU WOULD WANT TO BE FAIR TO A DEVELOPER, BUT  ISN'T IT MORE IMPORTANT TO BE FAIRO YOUR OWN ANN ARBOR CITIZENS. THANK YOU.
01:46:49.190: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.

01:48:06.567: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER 101.
01:48:07.201: >> YES, HELLO. I AM THE OWNER OF ANN ARBOR GUEST HOUSES, WHICH IS A SHORT-TERM RENTA BUSINESS, ALL CENTERED AROUND DOWNTOWN ANN ARBOR AND SERVING A NICHE MARKET FOR VISITORS TO THE U OF M AND OTHER PEOPLE. IN 2002, I MOVED MY BUSINESS, WHICH WAS -- IS BELLAMINA DAY SP FROM 409 BUILDING AND IT RECONFIGURATED, IT WAS ZONED C2 AT THE TIME. SO SINCE 2002, I HAVE BEEN RENTING ALMOST 20 YEARS, AND TO TRAVELERS, AND I NOW HAVE SEVEN LOCATIONS, ALTHOUGH COVID-19 IS FORCING ME TO SHUTOWN TWO OF THEM TO HELP STABILIZE MY BUSINESS AND CUT MY LIABILITIES. THE LONG STORY SHORT IS I HAVE DEVELOPED THESE BUSINESSES AND SOLD THE SPA AND I HAVE FOUR COMMERCIAL LEASES IN COMMERCIAL ZONES ON WASHINGTON STREET AND IN KERRYTOWN ON 4th AVENUE. AND AT AGE 68, TS IS MY RETIREMENT INCOME. I JUST CAN'T SEE STARTING ALL OVER AGAIN WITH ANOTHER BUSINESS. I CLEARLY DON'T LIVE IN MY RENTAL UNITS, BUT I DO CLAIM ONE AS HOME. AND I RECEIVE MAIL THERE AND I STAY THERE OFTEN AS M MY SECOND HOME. I HAVE BEEN HERE FOR LAST MONTH DOING THINGS, TRYING TO GET SINESS STARTEDGAIN AFTER COVID. I HAVE A BUSINESS LICENSE. I PAY A USE TAX. I PAY MICHIGAN INCOME TAX AND I SUPPORT THE ANN ARBOR COMMUNITY. I'M REQUESTING THAT CITY COUNCIL, MAYOR, AND THE ADMINISTRATOR REVIEW MY SITUATION ON ITS MERIT AS A SOLID BUSINESS MODEL, IN SUPPORT OF U OF M TEMPORY FACT CUL IS, U OF M, AND TOURISTS COMING INTO ANN ARBOR TO SPEND THEIR DOLLARS. IF YOU SHUT DOWN OUR BUSINESSES THAT ARE HURTING RIGHT NOW FROM THE COVID SHUTDOWN, YOU ARE HARMING WELL-MEANING PEOPLE WHO ARE SUPPORTING THE ECONOMY, AND CREATING GOODWILL IN THE COMMUNITY. OTHER STR SINESSES FEE THE SAME WAY AND WILL BE IMPACTED THE NAME. I ASK THAT YOU GRANDFATHER NONRESIDENT SHORT-TERM RENTALS AND PROTECT MY PREEXISTING RIGHTS AS AN ANN ARBOR COMMERCIAL BUSINESS. THANK YOU.
01:50:52.299: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
01:51:04.111: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER 790.
01:51:04.979: >> YES, THANK YOU FOR LETTING US SPEAK. I'M A RIDEN ON THE OLD WEST SIDE. I LIVE SEVERAL MONTHS OF THE YEAR IN ANN ARBOR. AND I LIVE SEVERAL MONTHS OF THE YEAR IN ARIZONA. AND I WANTED TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT OUR RENTERS. WE DO USE AIRBNB AND VRBO TO RENT OUR HOME OUT. I'M DISHEARTENED TO HEAR ABOUT SOME OF THE NEGATIVE COMMENTS ABT THOSE PLATFORMS. THEY PROVIDE GREAT VETTING AND REQUIRE AS MUCH VETTING, IF NOT MORE THAN SOME OF THE OTHER DIRECT WAYS THAT PEOPLE RENT THEIR HOMES BUT ALSO, AS AN IMPORTANT NOTE THAT I WANT TO MAKE AND I DO CONCUR WITH EVERYONE TALKING ABOUT GRANDFATHERING IN PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF, WHO HAVE BEEN USING THEIR HOME PT OF E YEAR AS I LIVE THERE SEVERAL MONTHS OF THE YEAR. I THINK GRANDFATHERING IS A GREAT SOLUTION TO AVOID A LOT OF BACK AND FORTH LITIGATION THAT WILL COME FORWARD IF THIS PASSES. ADDITIONALLY, I WANT TO MENTION SOME THINGS ABOUT MY RENTERS. ON THE WEEKENDS, WE GET RENTERS THAT ARE FAMILIES, FAMILIES THAT ARE IN FOR WEDDIS DURG THE WARM MTHS OF YEAR AND FAMILIES VISITING THEIR STUDENTS DURING THE SCHOOL YEAR. ADDITIONALLY, BECAUSE OF OUR LOCATION, AND MANY OTHER RENTALS THAT I KNOW THAT ARE IN THE AREA, DURING THE WEEK, MOST COMMONLY OUR RENTERS ARE WITH CHILDREN GOING TO MOT FOR SURGERY OR ADULTS GOING TO THE HOSPITAL FOR OTHER TREATMENTS. THESE MILIES IN MANY CASES CANNOT AFFORD HOTEL PRICES AT ANY TIME THROUGHOUT THE YEAR IN ANN ARBOR, NOT THAT THE PRICES ARE HIGH, BUT THE VALUE AT RENTAL HOMES LIKE MINE ARE SIGNIFICANT. A FAMILY OF FOUR, PLUS GRANDPARENTS, SIX PEOPLE, MAYBE A COUPLE OF FRIENDS THAT CAN RENT A HOME FOR BARELY THE PRICE OF ONE OR TWO HOTEL ROOM THAT AT MACCOMMODATE TWO TO FOUR PEOPLE AND YOU CAN GET EIGHT TO TEN PEOPLE IN A THREE OR FOUR BEDROOM HOME IN ANN ARBOR IS A HUGE SIGNIFICANT SAVINGS AND THESE PEOPLE, THEY ARE GOING TO STAY IN OTHER CITIES, YPSILANTI, PLYMOUTH, OR WHEREVER IF YOU GET RID OF 120 HOMES AND THAT WILL RECE RESURANT REVUE. THAT WILL REDUCE REVENUE AT SHOPS DOWNTOWN. MY RENTERS GO DOWNTOWN BECAUSE IT'S WALKABLE FROM MY HOME. I KNOW THEY HAVE ASKED ME FOR RECOMMENDATIONS FOR RESTAURANTS FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS WE HAVE BEEN DOING THIS. I WHOLE HEARTEDLY THAT THIS GET DENIED COMPLETELY AS IS OR THAT U ADD A GRANDTHER CLAUSE A AST FOR RENTERS LIKE ME, WHO HAVE OWNED THEIR HOME FOR SEVERAL YEARS LEGALLY, AND FOUL ALL THE RULES. WE ARE NOT A NUISANCE. OUR NEIGHBORS LOVE US AND WE TAKE GREAT CARE OF OUR PROPERTY.
01:53:57.685: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
01:53:59.420: >> THANK YOU.
01:54:00.087: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
01:54:09.363: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER 550? HELLO, CALLER 550, DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT?
01:54:19.273: >> Mayor Taylor: MA'AM, YOU ARE ON. IT'S YOUR TURN TO SPEAK.
01:54:21.375: >> OKAY. THANK YOU.
01:54:22.676: >> Mayor Taylor: YOU BET.
01:54:29.550: >> SO I'M A HOMEOWNER OF THE FIFTH WARD AND I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT, LIKE WE RUN AN AIRBNB TO SUPPORT OUR FAMILY AND MAKE LIVING IN ANN ARBOR AFFORDABLE. AND TO REGULATE AIRBNB AND I MEET MANY AIRBNB. THEY ARE MAINLY WOMEN-OWNED PROPERTIES, MINORITY-OWNED. MOMENT ARE WOMEN, BLACK PEOPLE OR HISPANIC, AND I'M REALLY THAT NANN ARBOR BASICALLY TAKES OPPORTUNITY AWAY FROM THE MINORITY GROUPS. AIRBNB PROVIDES US WITH A CHANCE TO MAKE A LIVING IN THIS TOWN AND BE ABLE TO AFFORD NOMAR GARCIAPARRA. AND THE CITYF ANN ARBOR IS -- YEAH, IT BREAKS MY HEART. I WOULD JUST LIKE THE COUNCIL TO SEND THIS BILL BACK AND START SUPPORTING THE PEOPLE WHO OWN AIRBNBs. THANK YOU.
01:55:50.164: >> Clerk Beaudry: MAYOR, THERE ARE NO MOREALLE WIT THEIR HANDS . I THINK THERE ARE THREE ON THE LINE WHO HAVEN'T SPOKEN. DOWN WDO YOU WANT ME TO CALL ON. I SEE CALLER 114 HAS NOW RAISED THEIR HAND.
01:56:02.042: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
01:56:04.344: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER 114, GO HELD.
01:56:07.181: >> THANK YOU. JAMIE, WARD 4. I WOULD LIKE TO SAY OWNER OCCUPIED SHORT-TERM RENTER HERE. IIVE INY HSE AND REPRESENT RENT ITOUT. THREE HOMES ON MY BLOCK HAVE ARE GOING TO LONG-TERM RENTALS. LONG-TERM RENTALS DO NOT HAVE INCENTIVES TO MAINTAIN NEIGHBORHOOD INTEGRITY ARE THEIR PRERTIES AND THERE'S NO GREATER HELL ON EARTH THAN BEING NEXT TO THE UNDERGRADS. BAN THE LONG-TERM RENTALS AND LEAVE THE SHORT-TERM RENTALS ALONE. THANK YOU.
01:56:51.325: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
01:57:03.570: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER 560.
01:57:04.204: >> I THINK IT SHOULD NOT MOVE FORWARD BECAUSE IT DOESN'T MEET THE STATED LEGISLATIVE PURPOSE AND I THINK WE ALL HAVE THIS IN FRONT OF US. SO JUST TO QUICKLY READ THROUGH IT. IT SAYS THAT THE CITY HAS DETERMINED REGULATIONS FOR SHORT-TERM RENTALS IS NECESSARY TO ESTABLISH A COMMUNITY STANDARDOR THE IEGRATIONF SHORT-TERM RENTAL COMMUNITIES WITH AN EXISTING RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS. I THINK THAT'S WHERE IT BREAKS APART. IT'S NOTTENT GREATING. GREATING -- INTEGRATING. IT'S STATING WHERE WE CAN OR CAN'T DO THIS. IT'S SAYING EXISTING BUSINESSES CAN'T DO THIS. I THINK GRANDFATHERG IS NOT GOING FAR ENOUGH. IT HAS TO BE RETHOUGHT SO IT SUPPORTS THE LEGISLATIVE PURPOSE AND NOT THIS INCENTIVIZES PEOPLE FOR TAKING UP THIS BUSINESS. THANK YOU.
01:57:51.618: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. IF ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO EAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING, DIAL STAR NINE.

01:59:36.056: >> Clerk Beaudry: I DON'T SEE ANY CALLERS ON THE LINE FOR THIS HEARING.
01:59:42.262: >> Mayor Taylor: BEFORE I WAS SO PROPERLY INTERRUPTED, WE HAVE BEFORE US THE REGULAR SESSION MEETING MINUTES OF JULY 20, 2020, IT'S MOVED BY SMITH AND SECONDED BY RAMLAWI. DISCUSSION. OF THE MINUTES? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] ALL OPPOSED? MINUTES ARE APPROVED. B1, AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND SECTION 1:265 OF CHAPTER 11 (RISK FUND) OF TITLE I OF THE CODE OF THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR.

MOVED BY ACKERMAN AND SECONDED BY NELSON. DISCUSSION OF B2. COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN?
02:00:49.396: >> Councilmember Ackerman: SORRY. WE RECVED SOME ADVICE THAT SOME POSTPONEMENT. I THINK WE HAD SOME ROBUST CONVERSATION OVER THE LAST MEETING BUT IF THERE'S USEFUL ADVICE IN THE LAST TWO PEEKS, I'M HOP TO THAT. I WANTED TO ADDRESS THAT ON THE FRONT END -- IF SOMEONE MAKES A MOTI TO POSTPONE. I UNDERSTAND THERE'S AT LEAST ONE REREPLEDDED BY STAFF, I ASSE THAT GETS MOVED AND ADOPTED BY ACCLAMATION IN ADVANCE OF THAT POSTPONEMENT. COUNCILMEMBER SMITH?
02:01:45.118: >> Councilmember Smith: I SENT THE AMENDMENT, AND COULD YOU CONTRIBUTE TO THAT TO COUNCIL AND I WILL READ THE AMENDMENT? IT STRIKES THE LANGUAGE ABOUT MAINTAINING NEIGHBORHOOD AND COMMUNITY CHARACT. SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN DO THAT QUICKLY.
02:02:13.313: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE A SECOND? SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
02:02:19.219: >> Councilmember Ackerman: CAN WE TAKE THEM SEPARATELY?
02:02:23.323: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: IS IS JUST ON THE LANGUAGE.
02:02:27.627: >> Mayor Taylor: THIS IS JUST ON THE POLICY?
02:02:31.631: >> Councilmember Ackerman: OH, OKAY. THANK YOU.
02:02:34.468: >> Mayor Taylor: I HAVE A COUPLE OF PEOPLE IN THE QUEUE. I HAVE SMITH AND LUMM. IS THE CHANGE TO 650 FRIENDLY TO THE BODY?
02:02:42.676: >> Councilmember Lumm: I WANT TO CONFIRM SOMETHING. I VE HAYR AND THEN LUMM IN THE QUEUE.
02:02:49.649: >> Councilmember Hayner: WELL, I WOULD JUST WANT TO COMMENT ON THIS. I UNDERSTAND WHERE PEOPLE ARE COMING FROM ON THIS. THIS NOTION OF NEIGHBORHOOD CHARACTER, IT'S VERY CHARGED TWO WORDS ALL O OF A SUDDEN, BUT IN DOING RESEARCH FOR THIS RESOLUTION, I AND IN THE MARCH APRIL ISSUE THEY TALK ABOUT STR POLICIES AND IT'S TO PRESERVE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND MAINTAIN NEIGHBORHOOD CHARACTER AND EVEN THE MML IS USING THIS TYPE OF LAUAGE. AND SO I GET IT. WE CAN TAKE IT OUT OF OURS BECAUSE THAT'S THEM. THAT'S NOT US, BUT IT'S NOT -- THIS LANGUAGE DOESN'T HAVE A USE OR A PURPOSE. IT'S BROADLY USED. I JUST WANT TO POINT THAT OUT.
02:03:52.245: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCMEMBER LUMM.
02:03:53.847: >> Councilmember Lumm: THAT'S A GOOD POINT. I WANT TO CONFIRM THAT WHAT IS BEING DELETED IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT MR. DELACOURT, STRIKING OUT THE WORDS AND THE CITY.
02:04:04.691: >> Councilmember Smith: IT IS EXACTLY T THE LANGUAGE THAT MR. DELACOURT SENT.
02:04:10.130: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE AMENDMENT? IS IT FRIENDLY TO THE BODY? THANK YOU. IT'S FRIENDLY. FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN MOTION AS AMENDED? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
02:04:33.753: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I HAVEN'T FULLY SPORTED THIS AS IT'S COMEHROUGH THIS BODY. I JUST HAVE SOME REME PROBLEMS H THE EFFECTS OF IT, NOT SO MUCH THE LANGUAGE. IT SEEMS TO ME WHEN WE TALK ABOUT LONG-TERM RENTALS AND SHORT-TERM RENTALS AND RENTALS IN GENERAL, YOU KNOW, WE ARE PROHIBITED FM DISCRIMINATING BY TENANT T TYPE AND I WONDER HW MUCH THAT PROHIBITION TO THE LENGTH OF RENTAL. IT'S STILL A PERSON RENTING A PROPERTY AND A PERSON LAYING THEIR HEAD ON THE BED AT NIGHT. AND SO THAT IS ONE OF MY CONCERNS ABOUT ADOPTIN THIS. I THINK TT THESE WOULDN'T EXIST. THEY WOULDN'T HAVE A PLACE IN OUR COMMUNITY IF THERE WAS NOT A DEMAND FOR THEM. AND I THINK THAT WE HAVE KIND OF FAILED TO DETERMINE WHAT IS A HEALTHY BALANCE OF THESE TYPES OF PROPERTIES IN OUR COMMUNITY. AND INSTEAD OF -- I WOULD SUGGEST THAT INSTEAD OF DEFINING WHERE THEY CAN EXIST, WE MAY ALSO WANT TO DEFINE HOW MANY AND IN WHAT RATIO AS OUR HOUSING STOCKS RISE AND FALL, AND HOPEFULLY RISES. WE HAVE NEIGHBORS HERE IN THE FIRST WARD, WHO HAVE REACHED OUT TO ME ABOUT THIS, WHO HAVE CONVERTED LONG-TERM RENTALS TO SHORT-TERM RENTALS TO THE PARCEL, TO THE USERS OF THAT PARCEL, AND YOU KNOW, POSSIBLY ALSO TO THE OWNERS OF THAT PROPERTY, BUT THEY ARE NOT OWNER OCCUPIED, BUT THEY REGALED ME WITH TALES OF HOW THANKFUL THAT EVERYBODY WAS TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY LIKE THIS. I THINK THAT THESE ARE IMPORTANT AND I THINK WE ARE LHTLY MISSING THE MARK WITH THIS LEGISLATION BEFORE US. I WANTED TO THROW THAT OUT THERE. I AGREE WITH SOME OF THE CALLERS THAT LONG-TERM RENTALS FROM A NUISANCE STANDPOINT EASILY PROVIDE AS MUCH OF A PROBLEM OR DIFFICULTY FOR THE NEIGHBORS AS THE SHO-TERM RENTALS AND LIKELY MORE SO BY VOLUME AND NUMBERS. I WOULD JUST -- I'M NOT A BIG FAN OF THIS LEGISLATION BEFORE US. I THINK IT GOES TOO FAR. I UNDERSTAND THAT RULES CHANGE IN BUSINESS, AND ALL OF YOUR INVESTMENTS DON'T ALWAYS WORK OUT. I THINK WE ARE BEING ARBITRARY, AND I THINK WE ARE SHUTTING THE DOOR ON THE NONOWNER OCCUPIED AREAS. I WILL NOT SUPPORT THIS. I JUST --T'S NOT FOR M THANK YOU. COUNCILMEMBER SMITH?
02:07:15.181: >> Councilmember Smith: YEAH. YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT WE ARE VERY CLOSE TO FINDING A MIDDLE GROUND ON THIS. I DO THINK THAT THERE IS THE ABILITY TO DO THIS WITHOUT INFLICTING MAXIMUM DAMAGE ON FOLKS THAT HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS. YOU KNOW, SO I'M GOING TO PROPOSE THAT WE POSTPONE THIS UNTIL THE FIRST MEETING IN SEPTEMBER TO GIVE STAFF AN OPPORTUNITY TO CRAFT SOME LANGUAGE ABOUT WHAT THAT EXCEION WOULD BE. AND FOR US TO CONSIDER THAT. I'M GOING TO THROW THAT OUT THERE.
02:08:00.026: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE A SECOND? SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER. DISCUSSION OF THE POSTPONEMENT? OKAY I HAVE GOT RAMLAWI AND LUMM ON THE QUEUE.
02:08:16.709: >> Councilmember Lumm: ACTUALLY, I HAD A QUESTION. THAT'S WHY I RAISED MY HAND. LUMM AND THEN RAMLAWI.
02:08:22.749: >> Councilmember Lumm: JUST A CLARIFYING QUESTION. AND THIS RELATES TO SOME OF THE STATEMENTS MADE IN THE PUBLIC HEARING BY VARIOUS FOLKS. THERE ARE REFERENCES TO CITY SANCTIONED SHORT-TERM RENTALS AND PREEXISTING RIGHTS. AS I SPEAK, MY CAT IS TRYING TO SPEAK. I APOLOGIZE. THAT SHORT-TERM RENTALS WERE PREVIOUSLY AUTHORIZED, AND THAT THERE WERE THESE OLD SET OF RULES AND YET IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE CITY'S ORDINANCES AND DEFINITIONS DO NOT PERMIT THEM WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE THIS PROPOSAL BEFORE US. MR. MCDONNELL, COULD YOU CLEAR THE AIR IF THESE WERE SANCTIONED. YEAH. AND WE ALSO HAVE THREATENED LAWSUITS SO DO WHAT YOU CAN IN ANSWERING MY QUESTION, IF YOU PREFER NOT TO ANSWER IT, CUT IT.
02:09:35.054: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. McDONALD?
02:09:35.788: >> YOU KNOW, I WOULD PREFER TO KEEP MY ADVICE IN WRITING, BUT I WILL SAY THIS, AND I THINK MR. DELL ACOURT OR MR. LENART CAN PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION ON THIS. WHAT SOME OF THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC REFERRED TO REGISTRATION. AND I THINK WHAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT, THE CITY DOES HAVE IN ITS HOUSING CODE,CHAPTEE THE REQUIREMENT FOR INSPECTION, FOR RENTAL UNITS. IT DOES NOT SPECIFY WHETHER THOSE RENTAL UNITS ARE SHORT-TERM RENTAL UNITS OR LONG-TERM, BUT I THINK WHAT THE OWNERS WERE TALKING ABOUT, IS THAT THEY HAD REGISTERED OR GONE THROUGH THE PROCESS OF HAVING THEIR RENTAL UNITS INSPECTED BY THE CITY. AND SO, I KNOW YOU HAD ASKED A QUESTION ABOUT, YOU KNOW, THERE WAS A LIST OF SHORT-TERM RENTALS, YOU KNOW THAT HAD BEEN SANCTIONED BY THE CITY. IT'S REALLY JUST A LIST OF -- OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAD GONE THROUGH THE RENTAL INSPECTION PROCESS, BUT I CERTAINLY WILL LOOK TO MR. DELACOURT OR MR. LENART IF THEY HAVE ANYTHING ELSE TO ADD TO THAT DESCRIPTION.
02:10:50.063: >> Councilmember Lumm: YEAH. AND ON POSTPONING, AND MR. McDONALD, IF YOU WANT TO CHIME IN ON THIS I'M SUPPORTIVE OF THE SHORT-TERM RENTAL ORDINANCE THAT'S NOW PROPOSED, BUT I -- WOULD THE ATTORNEY'S OFFICE BENEFIT FROM A BIT MORE TIME? IF SO, OBVIOUSLY THAT'S FINE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS AND QUESTIONS BEING RAISED?
02:11:22.929: >> I BELIEVE THAT THE MOTION ON THE FLOOR WAS FOR THE FIRST MEETING INEPTEMBER.
02:11:31.437: >> WE CERTAINLY COULD PROVIDE ADVICE BEFORE THAT, IF COUNCIL -- I WOULD SAY THIS, THOUGH, IF THERE'S -- IF THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT COUNCIL WANTS TO -- US TO DO WITH THE OR NANCE,  OR A -- ORDINANCE OR ADDRESS, IT YOU KNOW, WE WILL USE THE TIME THAT'S AVAILABLE TO -- TO RESPOND TO ALL THE UNCI QUESTNS AND CONCERNS, BUT I WILL ALSO LISTEN TO OTHER STAFF ABOUT THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE.
02:12:02.668: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU.
02:12:04.270: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
02:12:05.171: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  YOU KNOW, I DON'T NECESSARILY SUPPORT A POSTPONEMENT, I THINK THE INTENT OF THAT WOULD ONLY BE TO CARVE OUT WINNERS IN THIS SHORT-TERM RENTALS BASED ON THOSE WHO WERE OPPORTUNISTIC ENOUGH TO GET IN EARLY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE LOOPHOLES, AND LOCAL ORDI ORDINANCES. I WOULD ONLY SUPPORT IT IF IT DOESN'T HAVE SUPPORT IN GOING FORWARD, BUT I DON'T THINK THAT'S A GOOD -- THAT'S A GOOD FORM OF GOVERNMENT. I N UNDERSTAND GNDFATHERING THINGS IN, IN CASES WHERE WE WERE CHANGING THE RULES OF THE GAME, BUT WE'RE JUST ADDRESSING SHORTCOMINGS THAT WERE NOT ADDRESSED BEFORE, AND A NEW TYP OF BUSINESS MODEL THAT HAS COME ON LATELY. SO I DON'T SUPPORT IT, BASED ON THE PRINCIPLES OF PICKING WINNERS AND LOSERS. AND RATHER HAVING AN ARBITRARY WAY OF DOING IT. I THINK IT'S A CRITICAL TIME IN OUR ECONOMY. OUR GDP BY ONE-THIRD, NOT ONLY SHORT-TERM RENTALS THAT ARE SUFFERING RIGHT NOW, BUT MAJOR PARTS OF OUR ECONOMY, AND I THINK THIS IS A GOOD TIME TO HIT THE RESET BUTTON AND GET OUR HOUSE IN ORDER BEFORE WE GO FORWARD WITH THE NORMAL ECONOMY. SHORT-TERM RENTALS GOING BACK UP ANY TIME SOON. AND IF THERE'S A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO DO THE TYPE OF LEGISLATION THAT WE NEED TO DO, IS AT A MOMENT LIKE NOW. AND GO -- I WILL LISTEN TO MY COLLEAGUES AND I WLD RATHER NOT POSTPONE IT BECAUSE, AGAIN, THE INTENT IS TO PICK WINNERS AND LOSERS.
02:14:38.057: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
02:14:39.258: >> Councilmember Nelson: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I APPRECIATE WHAT COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI JUST SHARED. I ACTUALLY AGREE WITH MUCH OF WHAT HE SAI PARTICULARLY IF A POSTPONEMENT IS ARE TO THE PURPOSE OF BASICALLY PICKING WINNERS. AND CRAFTING OUT EXCEPTIONS FOR A SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE. I'M VERY UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THAT. I THINK FOR ME, WHAT I THINK THIS DECISION IS ABOUT IS HOW WE SEE OUR COMMUNITY FUNCTION, A IT'S TRUE THAT SOME COMMUNITIES RELY SIGNIFICANTLY ON TOURISM, AND AIRBNBs -- OUR SHORT-TERM RENTALS FUNCTION WELL IN THOSE COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES MAY CHOOSE NOT TO REGULATE THEM. BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY THEIR COMMUNITY WORKS. BUST BUT IN ANN ARBOR, WE HAD AT OF CONVERSATIONSBOUT H O CITY CAN BEST FUNCTION WHERE PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO WORK AND SCHOOL AND WITHIN REACH SO THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO CLIMB IN A CAR. I MEAN, WE HEARD THE VALUE OF A SHORT-TERM RENTAL THAT IS WITHIN WALKING DISDANCE OF OUR DOWNTOWN. HOW MUCH MORE VALUE WOULD THAT BE TO A YEAR-ROUND RESIDENT? SO I GUESS I -- I WILL NOT SUPPORT A POSTPONEMENT OF THIS, BECAUSE I DON'T -- I DON'T SEE THAT WE -- THERE'S ANY MORE INFORMATION TO BE GAINED BETWEEN NOW AND SEPTEMBER. I THINK WE ALREADY KNOW THAT ANN ARBOR IS A PLACE WHERE COMMUNITY MEMBERS WANT TO LIVE, WORK, AND GO TO SCHOOL, AND BE ACCESSIBLE TO THIS IN TOWN AND WE -- WE -- I SUPPOSE WE HAVE MEDICAL TOURISM. WE HAVE TOURISM FOR PEOPLE VISITING FOR COLLEGE EVENTS, BUT WE HAVE A HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY. YEAH, I WILL NOT SUPPORT THIS POSTPONEMENT. THANK YOU.
02:16:40.846: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBERCR BANNISTER.
02:16:45.318: >> Councilmember Bannister: THANKS, EVERYONE. I THINK A POSTPONEMENT COULD BE GOOD IF THE INTENT DURING THAT TIME PERIOD WAS FOR OF THE SHORT-TERM RENTAL, NONOWNER OCCUPI COMMUNITYO WORK WITH STAFF TO SEE IF THEY COULD CREATE A SENSIBLE LIST OF LEGAL NON-CONFORMING EXCEPTIONS AND I DON'T FEEL THAT'S PICKING WINNERS AND LOSERS. I THINK THAT IS OFFERING POSSIBLY LEGALLY DESERVED PROTECTION FOR THOSE LOCAL BUSINESS OWNERS WHO MIGHT AS WE HEARD. MANY LIVE DOWN THE STREET AND THEY INVESTED THEIR SAVINGS TO DO THIS AND THAT ONE GUY WAS DOING IT SHORT-TERM UNTIL HIS IN-LAW PARENTS COULD MOVE IN. THE OTHER GUY WAS A -- ARM AND SO FORTH AND THEY ARE LOCAL PEOPLE AND I FEEL THAT THEIR ARGUMENTS THAT THEY NEED SOME PROTECTION FOR THE INVESTMENTS THEY ALREADY MADE. THAT RESONATED WITH ME. SO I THINK A POSTPONEMENT, IF IT WAS TO WORK ON CREATING THE LIST. AND I KNOW STAFF HAS SAID, THE LIST IS DIFFICULT TO CREATE AND HOW DO YOU CUT IT OFF. THE SHORT-TERM RENTAL COMMUNITY, MANY OF WHOM TALKED TONIGHT AT TO USE THEIR KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERTISE TO HELP TO MAKE IT EASY FOR STAFF AND IT'S NOT AS ARDUOUS AS IT WOULD FIRST APPEAR.
02:18:49.642: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
02:18:51.811: >> Councilmember Eaton: I DON'T SUPPORT A POSTPONEMENT TO DESIGN A DIDN'T AN EXCEPTION FOR THOSE HAVE BEEN RUNNING SHORT-TERM RENTALS IN RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS UP TO THIS POINT. I DO, HOWEVER, SUPPORT A POSTNEMENT TOET LE CLEAR LEGAL ADVICE ON WHETHER OR NOT THOSE USES WERE ACTUALLY LEGAL, NON-CONFORMING USE. AND SO BEFORE WE TRY TO CARVE OUT AN EXCEPTION UNDER THE NON-CONFORMING USE DOCTRINE, I WANT TO KNOW IF IT WAS A LEGAL USE AT ALLNDE REAY HAVEN'T TOUCHED ON THAT SUBJECT AT ALL. AND SO I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS POSTPONEMENT TO GET A CLEARER IDEA FROM OUR LAWYERS AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THIS WAS A LEGAL USE OF THOSE PROPERTIES. COUNCILMEMBER GRAND?
02:19:51.303: >> Couilmember GrandI THINK COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN WAS BEFORE ME. I SAW HIS HAND.
02:19:56.675: >> Councilmember Ackerman: COUNCILMEMBER EATON SAID EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED TO SAY.
02:20:01.947: >> Councilmember Grand: AND IT WAS PRETTY CLOSE TO WHAT I WANTED TO SAY. I WILL SUPPORT THE POSTPONEMENT TO GET? LEGAL ADVICE. I WANTED TO MAKE A COMMENT BECAUSE WE HEARD FROM A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNI AND, YOU KNOW, PART OF ME QUESTIONS HIKE, WHEN WE FINALLY GOT THIS ORDINANCE BACK, LIKE HOW DID WE GET HERE? I REMEMBER -- I FEEL LIKE THE REASON FOR WHY WE STARTED THIS IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN WHERE WE ARE NOW. AND I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATIONS AROUND HOUSING AND WHAT TYPE OF HOUSING THIS IS TAKING OFF THE MARK AND I MARKEI APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION AROUND SOME OF THE BENEFITS FOR PEOPLE WHO DO VISIT OUR COMMUNITY, AND WHERE ONE IS AVAILABLE TO THEM DOESN'T WORK, ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THAT WE DO HAVE ONE OF THE HIGHEST RANKING MEDICAL CENTERS WHERE A LOT OF SPECIALTY CARE DOES NOT PLACE. MECAL URISTS.TO CALL THEM I THINK THEY ARE PEOPLE WHO COME AND SOMETIMES NEED TO BE IN A CLEAN SPACE OR WITH FAMILIES AND I DO APPRECIATE I CAN'TIST THAT THERE'S SOME REALLY BENEFICIAL USES FOR SHORT-TERM RENTALS BUT I WANT TO COMMENT THAT CERTAINLY NOT ALL. IF YOU ARE GOING TO BE P PEJORATIVE TOWARDS RENTERS AND STUDENTS AND THOSE WHO WANT TO BE ABLE TO LIVE AND WORK IN OUR COMMUNITY, I DON'T NECESSARILY THINK THAT IF IT WENT TO LONG-TERM RENTAL IT WOULD BECOME AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUT SO USE THAT TYPE OF RHETORIC, IT DOESN'T MAKE ME WANT TO HELP YOU. I WOULD APPRECIATE IF WE COULD TRY NOT HIT LONG-TERM RENTERS AGAINST SHORT-TERM RENTERS AND APPRECIATE THAT LONG-TERM RENTERS ARE ALSO GREAT NEIGHBORS.
02:22:14.980: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
02:22:18.250: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU. IN LISTENING TO THE DISCUSSION, I SEE WE ARE GOING BACK AND FORTH AND LOTS OF GOOD POINTS ARE BEING MAD BECAUSE I THINK -- BASICALLY, I AGREE WITH WHAT COUNCILMEMBER EATON ARTICULATED. I DON'T SUPPORT POSTPONEMENT TO GRANDFATHER EXISTING SHORT-TERM REALS AND WERE ALLOWING -- WE ARE NOT PROHIBITING NONOWNER OCCUPIED RENTALS THAT ARE UTILIZED FOR LESS THAN 30 DAYS. WIWE ARE NOT PREVENTING THEM FRM UTILIZING THEIR ASSET. THEY CAN STILL RENT THE PROPERTY. AND WHAT I -- I DO THINK THAT WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT EVERY GRANDFATHERED UNIT IS ONE LESS UNIT OF PERMANENT HOUSING. I DO NOT SUPPORT POSTPONING TO FURTHER EXPLORE ALLOWING EXISTING NONOWNER OCCUPIED UNITS TO BE GRANDFATHERED AS NOW NOT PROPOSED, BUT I DO THINK WE WOULD BENEFIT FROM GIVING THE ATTORNEY'S OFFICE A BIT MORE TIME TO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY LEGAL ADVICE. SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING POSTPONEMENT.
02:23:50.509: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER SMITH? Councilmemb Smith: I'M GOOD.
02:23:53.312: >> Mayor Taylor: I'M GOING TO SUPPORT POSTPONEMENT AS WELL. I'M PERHA PERHAPS A LITTLE BIT P IN THE AIR THAN MY COLLEAGUES ON THE QUESTION OF GRANDFATHERING. YOU KNOW, WHEN WE -- WHEN WE HAD MEDICAL MAR MARIJUANA DISPENSARS CR U THE WE OF QUESTIABLE LEGAL POSITION AND -- BUT THEY PROVIDED A SERVICE THAT FOLKS WITHIN THE COMMUNITY AND PEOPLE FROM -- FOLKS OUTSIDE OF THE COMMUNITY VALUED. AND OVER THE COURSE OF TIME, I THINK WE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT WITH RESPECT TO THAT SERVICE, THE SERVICE OFFERING A CAP  WAS REASONABLE AND THAT IT WAS REASONABLE TO HONOR TO -- TO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE WERE FIRST MOVERS WHO MADE SOME INVESTMENT. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THAT SITUATION RHYMES HERE. YOU KNOW, I THINK NONE OF US WANT A GREAT PROLIFERATION OF STRs. WE VIEW THOSE -- THAT WOULD BE, I THINK, UNDERSTANDABLY UNDESIRABLE AND ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THE MARK DOES VALUE THEM. THEY DO SERVE A ROLE, BOTH FOR PEOPLE WHO LIVE HERE AND PEOPLE THAT DON'T. AND I THI IT'S TRUE THAT PEOP HAVE MADE INVESTMENTS AND IMCONVINCED BY THE NUMBER OF -- I'M CONVINCED BY THE NUMBER OF FOLKS WHO HAVE COME HERE TODAY. WE CERTAINLY HAVE LOTS OF LOCAL FOLKS WHO HAVE MADE INVESTMENTS DOWN THE STREET. I DON'T KNOW THAT GRANDFATHED ENVIRONMT WOULD BE THE PERFECT ONE, BUT MAYBE THE BEST. I WILL SUPPORT THE POSTPONEMENT TO ARE LEGAL ADVICE AND MORE TIME TO THINK ABOUT. THIS. I THINK I HEARD SOME DISPUTE ABOUT IT. WHO ON POINT TODAY, MS. BEAUDRY?
02:26:02.040: >> Clerk Beaudry: MAYOR, YOU ARE.
02:26:05.077: >> Mayor Taylor: ROLL CALL VOTE, STARTING WITH MEL. ME. ON POSTPONEMENT. YES.

02:26:36.575: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION CARRIES. 9:27.
02:26:41.980: >> Mayor Taylor: LET'S TAKE A SHORT BREAK. LET US RECONVENE AT:40. [ BREAK ] Mayor Taylo WE ARE BACK AFTER A SHORT BREAK. DC-1, RESOLUTION TO ORDER ELECTION AND TO DETERMINE BALLOT QUESTION FOR CHARTER AMENDMENT TO ALLOW FOR RANKED CHOICE VOTING. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRAND, SECONDED WITH COUNCILMEMBER SMITH. DISCUSSION, PLEASE OF DC-1? COCILMEMBER GRAND.
02:40:38.149: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. I WANT TO THANK THE MANY ADVOCATES IN THE COMMUNITY HAVE BEEN WORKING LONG AND HARD IN OUR COMMUNITY AND ACROSS STATE TO HELP US COME UP WITH LANGUAGE THAT WOULD ENABLE US TO HAVE NK CHOEOTING. WANT TO ADDRE A FEW OF THE CONCERNS UP FRONT THAT I HEARD ABOUT RANK CHOICE VOTING. THE MAIN CONCERN I HAVE HEARD FROM MY COLLEAGUES IS THAT THEY ONLY WANT RANK CHOICE VOTING IF IT IS GOING TO BE NONPARTISAN. AND TO ME, THOSE ARE TWO TOTALLY SEPARATE ISSUES, BOTH LEGALLY AND IN PRIIPLE. SO FIRST LEGALLY, I HAVE HEARD FROM MANY PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY WOULD SUGGESTED THAT WE HAVE A COMBINATION BALLOT INITIATIVE THAT WOULD HAVE BOTH NONPARTISAN AND RANK CHOICE VOTING IN THE SAME PLACE. WE CAN'T DO THAT, BECAUSE NONPARTISAN IS A SEPARATE CHARTER ISSUE. SECOND, WITH NONPARTISAN, I STILL DO SEE THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF TRADEOFFS. I THINK WE REALLY DID SEE THAT OUR COMMUNITY VALUES THAT INFORMATION IN THE SOFT EWILL WELCELECTIONAND IT MOVES MAYOR D COUNCIEMBERS DOWN BALLOT. WITH RANK CHOICE VOTING, EVERY PERSON THAT I REALLY TALKED TO IS JUST ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT RANK CHOICE VOTING AND INCREASES PARTICIPATION. IT FEELS MORE DEMOCRATIC. IT ENABLES VOTERS TO HAVE A SAY IN NOT ONLY WHO THEIR FIRST CHOI IS BUT IF THERE WERE THOSE IN THE SECOND CHOICE, AND IT ENCOURAGES CONSENSUS. AND IT'S THOUGHT TO BUILD ALLIANCES INSTEAD OF MAKING CAMPAIGNS MORE CONFRONTATIONAL, SO THAT AS WE HEARD FROM MICHELE HUGHES EARLIER TODAY, WOULD CALLED IN, THAT INSTEAD OF TRYING TOEE PEOPLEROM PARTICIPATING IN ELECTIONS, THOSE WHO ARE ALIGNED CAN ACTUALLY BOTH PARTICIPATE IN AN ELECTION AND NOT SPOIL ONE ANOTHER'S CHANCES OF REPRESENTING WHAT THEIR CONSTITUENTS MUST VALUE AND WHAT THEIR VOTERS MUST VALUE. I ALSO WANT TO GIVE THANKS TO MATT THOMAS WHO WORKED SO HARD OFFICE T G THIS TO US INY'S ME, RIGHT OPE ON THE HEELS OF WORKING ON THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING MILLAGE LANGUAGE AND WAS ABLE, ONCE HE WAS DONE WITH THAT, TO GIVE THIS SOME INTENTION. SO I ALSO DO APOLOGIZE FOR THE LATENESS OF THIS, ALTHOUGH, I GUESS NOT AS LATE SINCE WE ARE MEETING ABOUT NONPARTISAN ON MONDAY WHICH IS EVEN LATER. AND GIVEN JUST A COUPLE OF DAY'S NOTICE. I HOPE THAT WAS NOT AN IMPEDIMENT. I THINK THE TIMING WAS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT I PROMISED. WE DID HAVE A WEEK AS PROMISED THAT THIS WAS -- THAT WAS PUT ON OUR AGENDA, AND IT WAS WELL NOTICED BEFORE THAT. THANK YOU.
02:43:54.078: >> Mayor Taylor: I AM VERY GLAD TO BE PART OF BRINGING THIS PROPOSAL BEFORE COUNCIL AND HOPEFULLY BEFORE THE VOTERS. YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT WE ARE -- WE ARE OFTEN TASKED WITH HOW TO -- HOW TO OPEN UP AND BRING MORE INFORMATION TO VOTERS, TO ENABLE VOTERS TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES. I THEY WILL RANK CHOICE VOTING PROVIDES, YOU KNOW, MULTIPLE AVENUES OF EXPRESSION AND MULTIPLE AVENUES OF ENTRY TO THE BALLOT. MINORITY PARTIES WOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO AT LEAST PARTICIPATE IN A WAY THAT WAS -- HOPEFULLY DURING THE FRUITFUL AND EXPAND -- AND EXPAND THE SCOPE OF POLITICAL DISCOURSE TO -- TO, YOU KNOW, ALTER THE WINDOW. I THINK RANK CHOICE VOTING AT THE SAME TIME RECOGNIZES THAT PARTY LABELS DO CARRY WITH THEM MEANINGFUL INFORMATION FOR VOTERS IT HONORS THAT PRINCIPLE AS WELL. I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW IF YOU TALK TO POLITICAL SCIENTISTS UP AND DOWN THE LINE, THEY WILL SAY RANK CHOICE VOTING IS A PREFERRED WAY OF DOING BUSINESS. I THINK IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO, A SMART THING TO DO. I THINK IT EXPANDS PARTICIPATION AND EXPANDS OPTIONS FOR ANN ARBOR VOTERS. AND AT THE SAME TIME BEING SURING THATHEY HAVE THE INFORMATION THAT THEY NEED TO MAKE A WISE CHOICE. I HOPE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO BRING IT FORWARD TODAY. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
02:45:28.639: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, MAYOR TAYLOR, AND THANKS FOR THE SPONSORS AND BRINGING THIS FOR DISCUSSION. I DO SHARE SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT COUNCILMEMBER GRAND HAS RAISED THAT SOME OF US HAVE WITH THIS, WITH PARTISAN ELECTIONS. YOU KNOW, IF WE ARE A COMMUNITY THAT MOST COMMUNITIES IN MICHIGAN OPERATE UNDER, NONPARTISAN ELECTIONS, WE ARE ONLY ONE OF THREE IN THE STATE OF MICHIGAN THAT CONTINUE TO HAVE PARTISAN ELECTIONS. I DON'T THK IT ACHIEVES THE GOALS THAT HAVE BEEN LAID OUT JUST NOW BY THE MAYOR AND BY COUNCILMEMBER GRAND. I DON'T THINK THAT THIS WILL INCREASE PARTICIPATION OR INCLUSIVITY OR BRING MORE PEOPLE UNDER THE UMBRELLA. IN FACT, I THINK IT WILL HAVE THE EXACT OPPOSITE EFFECT. I THINK IT WILL CONTINUE THE PATH THAT WE HAVE BEEN ON RECENTLY, AND THAT'S THE CONSOLIDATION OF POWER. CONSOLIDATION OF POWER IN A TWO-PARTY SYSTEM, BUT IN A ONE PARTY TOWN. COMMITY TO HAVER ABILITY IN THIS INDEPENDENT-MINDED FOLKS TO PARTICIPATE IN CIVIL GOVERNMENT. WE GOT RID OF THE ODD YEAR ELECTION CYCLE. THE ODD YEAR ELECTION CYCLE GAVE INDEPENDENT CANDIDATES AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A SHOT AT WINNING AND HAVING A SEAT AT THIS TABLE. THAT HAS BEEN ELIMINATED. BY GOING TO RANK CHOICE VOTING FOR LOCAL OFFICES, USING A PARTISAN SYSTEM, I THINK WILL LEAD US ULTIMATELY TO A LOCAL OLIGARCHY. ONLY FOLKS WHO HAVE TREMENDOUS WEALTH AND CONNECTIONS AND POWER AND OPPORTUNITY WILL ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO GAME THE SYSTEM AND GAIN SEATS AND REPRESENT THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. I CA SUPPORT THIS, I WE HAD NONPARTISAN ELECTIONS. I SUPPORT IT IN THAT -- IN THAT WAY, BUT THE WAY I UNDERSTAND IT, THIS WOULD RESULT IN SOMEONE HAVING TO RUN EFFECTIVELY TWO CAMPAIGNS, WELL OVER SIX MONTHS OF THEIR TIME COMMITTED IN ORDER TO SIT AND BE A PART -- AND HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY THAT WE SHARE TONIGHT. AND I REALLY DO THINK IF THIS WAS TO HAPPEN, IF IT WAS ALLOWED TO HAPPEN, WITH A PARTISAN STEM, AN A ONE-PARTY TOWN, IT LEADS US TO AN OLIGARCHY. AND I WILL RESERVE MY COMMENTS -- MY SECOND TIME TO COMMENT LATER. THANK YOU.
02:48:53.944: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
02:48:55.079: >> Councilmember Eaton: THANK YOU. I SUPPORT RANK CHOICE VOTING. BUT AS THE RESOLUTION ACKNOWLEDGES, STATE LAW DOESN'T CURRENTLY PERMIT RANK CHOICE VOTING. THERE ARE CURRENTLY SOME BILLS PENDING IN THE LEGISLATURE TO ALLOW RANK CHOICE VOTING. HOUSE BILL 5281 AND HOUSE BILL 5282. HB-5281 WOULD ALLOW RANK CHOICE VOTING WHEN THE ELECTION OF CITY OFFICERS IS THE ONLY ELECTION ON THE BALLOT. SO, FOR EXAMPLE, THE BALLOT WE HAD ON TUESDAY COULD NOT HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO RANK CHOICE VOTING UNDER THE PROSED LEGISLATN CURRENTLY PENDING IN OUR LEGISLATURE BECAUSE IT HAD STATE AND FEDERAL OFFICES OPEN THE SAME BALLOT. OUR STATE ELECTION LAW EXPRESSES A PREFERENCE FOR LOCAL ELECTIONS TO BE IN ODD NUMBERED YEARS SO THAT THEY DON'T COMMINGLE WITH STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTIONS, AND SO THERE'S AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT THAT A LOCAL ELECTION IN AN ODD NUMBERED YEAR WOULD BE MUCH BETTER OPERATED UNDER RANK CHOICE VOTING WERE IT UNDER OUR CURRENT SYSTEM IN EVEN NUMBERED YEARS, IT WOULD NOT BE PERMITTED. I -- I SUPPORT RANK CHOICE VOTING, BUT BECAUSE OF THE MESS THAT WE MADE OF OUR LOCAL ELECTION LAWS, AND HOW WE DEVIATED FROM THE STATE ELECTION LAW, I DON'T THINK IT'S WORKABLE, AND SO I WON'T BE SUPPORTING IT THIS EVENING.
02:50:45.255: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
02:50:50.327: >> Councilmember Lumm: SORRY. THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING THIS TONIGHT FOR VARIOUS REASONS. RANK CHOICE VOTING IS AN ELECTION MECHANISM THAT ONE STATE, MAINE, AND 20 CITIES DO NOW USE. IT'S SOMETHING THAT ANN ARBOR MAY WANT TO CONSIDER IF AND WHEN ITS ALLED IN MICHIGAN, WHICH AS OTHERS HAVE STATED IT IS NOT NOW PERMITTED UNDER MICHIGAN LAW. WHILE LEGISLATION WAS INTRODUCED IN DECEMBER OF 2019 TO ALLOW IT, THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LEGISLATION IS -- IS UNCLEAR AND IFFY. I HAVE NOT DECIDED IF SUPPORT RANK CHOICE VOTING OR NOT. I'M DOING MY DUE DILIGENCE NOW, AND I WOULD JUST SAY I THINK THERE'S STRONG ARGUMENTS ON BOTH SIDES, BUT REGARDLESS OF THAT, I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S AT ALL APPROPRIATE TO HAVE NASH RESIDENTS VOTING ON HYPOTHETICALS, WHICH IS WHAT THIS IS. IF THE ENABLING LEGISLATION IS PASSED,ND THE SPECIFIC PROCESSES, REGULATIONSEN ATHE REQUIREMENTS ARE DEFINED, THEN THAT'S THE APPROPRIATE TIME TO PLACE THE QUESTION ON THE BALLOT FOR THE VOTERS TO DECIDE, NOT NOW BEFORE THE STATE EVEN ALLOWS IT. IF IT EVER DOES. I WOULD ALSO JUST NOTE THAT THE BALLOT LANGUAGE IS NOTHING TO EXPLAIN WHAT THIS IS. IT JUST SAYS ANN ARBOR SHOULD ADOPT RANKHOICEOTING IF THE STATE ALLOWS IT. WHAT RANK CHOICE VOTING DOES NOT DO, HOWEVER, IS ADDRESS THE PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE IN ANN ARBOR THAT LOWER TURNOUT AUGUST PRIMARIES DETERMINE WHO THE MAYOR AND COUNCILMEMBERS DO. RANK CHOICE VOTING DOES NOT CHANGE THAT. THAT ISS WOULD BE ADDRESSED, HOWEVER, WITH NONPARTISAN ELECTIONS WHERE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, THE HIGHER TURNOUT, NOVEMBER GENERAL ELECTION WOULD BE THE DECIDING ELECTION. SO CONTRARY TO WHAT WAS SAID PREVIOUSLY, NONPARTISAN CLEARLY INCREASES PARTICIPATION, BECAUSE THE ELECTIONS WOULD OCCUR IN THE GERAL ELECTION. WE WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT AS HAS BEEN NOTED OPEN MONDAY NIG NIGHT AS WE HAVE I ASPECIAL SESSION OF PARTY VERSUS NONPARTISAN ON THE NOVEMBER 3rd BALLOT. YOU WILL RECALL THAT A YEAR AGO, SEVEN COUNCILMEMBERS SUPPORTED ALLOWING VOTERS TO DECIDE THE PARTISAN/NONPARTISAN QUESTION, AND THE MAYOR VETOES GIVING THE MEMBERS. COUNCILMEMBER SMITH VOTED AGAINST PLACING THE QUESTION ON THE 2019 BALLOT BUT INDICATED HE WOULD SUPPORT PLACING IT ON THE NOVEMBER 2020 BALLOT. ON MONDAY, WE'LL ALL HAVE THAT CHANCE. ANYWAY, THE IMMEDIATE DISCUSSION HERE IS ON RANK CHOICE VOTING D ON THAT, T IMPORTANT POINT TO ME IS THE TIMING. IN MY VIEW, WE SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERING THIS TONIGHT. WE SHOULD NOT BE PLACING A HYPOTHETICAL ON THE BALLOT. INSTEAD, WE SHOULD WAIT TO SEE IF RANK CHOICE VOTING EVEN BECOMES LEGAL IN MICHIGAN AND IF IT DOES, THEN ALLOW ANN ARBOR VOTERS TO DECIDE THE QUESTION. I WON'T BE SUPPORTING THIS TOGHT. ANONE LAST COMME, I THINK WE NEED TO BE HONEST, AND COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI CERTAINLY TOUCHED UPON THIS WHEN HE SAID IT'S A ONE PARTY TOWN. MINORITY PARTIES CANNOT PARTICIPATE IN OUR LOCAL ELECTIONS WITH THE NEW ARRANGEMENT WITH FOUR-YEAR TERMS, AND EVEN YEAR ELECTNS. THAT'S THE HONEST TRUTH. AND, AGAIN, WHY NONPARTISAN WOULD MOVE OUR ELECTIONS TO THE HIGHER TURNOUT NOVEMBER GENERAL ELECTION AND THAT'S A HUGE POSITIVE IF WE WANT TO INCREASE PARTICIPATION AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE. SO, AGAIN, I WON'T BE SUPPORTING THIS TONIGHT, AND I DO APPRECIATE YOUR LISTENING. LISTENING TAME COUNCILWOMAN GRISWOLD.
02:54:53.236: >> Councilmember Griswold: RANK CHOICE VOTING IS A GREAT INTELLECTUAL EXERCISE AND SEEMS LIKE A WONDERFUL SOLUTION, BUT WHEN YOU ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT IT, IT MEANS HAVING TWO BALLOTS. WE WOULD HAVE TWO BALLOTS IN AUGUST AND TWO BALLOTS IN NOVEMBER. WE WOULD HAVE TWO BALLOTS DURING A PRESIDTIAL ELECTION. I JUS THINK WE WOULD HAVE TWO BALLOTS BEING SENT OUT THROUGH THE INDUSTRY BALLOT PROCESS. I THINK THAT'S JUST WAY TOO COMPLICATED. MY TOP PRIORITY IS TO MOVE THE ELECTION TO NOVEMBER. STATE LAW REQUIRES THAT SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS BE ELECTED IN NOVEMBER. I PREVIOUSLY SERVED ON THE SCHOOL BOARD. IT IS VERY SIMILAR TO SERVING ON CITY COUNCIL. CITY COUNCIL IS NO MORE SPECIAL. THERE'S NO REASON WHY WE NEED TO HAVE AN AUGUST ELECTION AND A NOVEMBER ELECTION. IN NOVEMBER, THE STUDENTS ARE HERE. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE NOVEMBER ELECTIONS AND IF WE ARE GOI TO HAVE RANK CHOICE VOTING, I BELIEVE THAT IT NEEDS TO BE ON ODD YEARS SO THAT WE'RE NOT HAVING TWO BALLOTS SENT OUT WHEN WE ARE HAVING A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. THANK YOU.
02:56:07.044: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
02:56:09.846: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANKS, MR. MAYOR. BOY, AM I -- MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SPOKEN WELL TO THIS ISSUE ALREADY, AND SOME OF THE LANGUAGE THEY HAVE USED IS MUCH MORE HE  ELEGANT THAN WHAT I WAS CONSIDERING SAYING. THEY -- ESSENTIALLY THE FACT THAT IT'S NOT AVAILABLE AT THE STATE LEVEL RIGHT NOW AND WE WOULD NEED PERMISSION TO ADOPT THIS ESSENTIALLY FROM THE STATE IS REASON ENOUGH NOT TO PUT IT ON THE BALLOT NOW, VAGARS OF THBALLOT QUESTION ARE JUST TOO MUCH FOR ME. IT'S TOO LITTLE FOR ME IS WHAT IT REALLY IS. AND, YOU KNOW, I -- I WILL SHARE SOME FOLKS' DISAPPOINTMENT THAT THIS CAME LATE TO THE GAME ON FRIDAY, AFTER WRITTEN QUESTIONS WERE SHUT OFF. IT DIDN'T REALLY AFFECT IT. I HAVE BEEN LOOKING INTO THIS FOR ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF NOW, SINCE I HAVE BEEN ON COUNCIL AND ME FO FOLKS IN THE COMMUNITY DID ASKED ME TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT, AND WE HAVE COUNCIL 5B. WE LIKE TO FOLLOW THE RULE. I'M NOT A FAN OF THAT. I WANT TO PUT THAT OUT THERE. WHAT -- I THINK WHAT WE SAW IN THIS -- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE SAW IN THIS LAST ELECTION, AND IT WAS STATED QUITE FRANKLY CANDIDATES, THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SPEND HOWEVER MUCH MONEY THEY NEED TO SPEND TO GET ELECTED. AND WHAT I SEE, WHAT SOME PEOPLE WILL CALL CAMPAIGNS BUILDING ALLIANCES, WILL NOT NECESSARILY BE  A VIOLATION OF CAMPAIGN FINANCE LAW. AND WHAT SOME CALL CAMPAIGNS BUILDING ALLIANCES, OTHERS WOULD POTENTIALLY -- I COULD SEE THAT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN WOULD BE THAT YOU HAVE LARGE MONEY CAMPAIGNS FUNDING A SERIES OF CANDIDATES WITH THE AGREEMENT THAT ALL THREE CANDIDATES WOULD SHARE ONE ANOTHER'S RANKINGS AND THAT WOULD BE THE WORD, AND COMPLETELY NOT RANK THE FOURTH PERSON AND THAT'S WHAT I THINK WOULD HAPPEN. I'M SUSPICIOUS TO PLACING THIS ON THE BALLOT PRIOR TO IT BEING LEGAL. THERE ARE EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR INCREASING PARTICIPATION IN OUR COMMUNITY AND VOTER TURNOUT BY HAVING THE ELECTIONS I NOVEMBER, WHEN MORE PEOPLE ARE SHOWING UP ANYWAY, WHEN MORE STUDENTS ARE HERE, WHICH WILL ALLOW STUDENTS AND -- AND ALSO THAT -- THAT WHOLE POPULATION RELATED TO THE UNIVERSITY, WHICH IS -- DEFINITELY A PART OF THE FABRIC OF OR COMMUNITY TO PARTICIPATE, I THINK IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT AND WE WILL GET EQUAL RESULTS WITH THAT. AND SO AS A TL FOLKS IN RESPONDING TO TD. TOLD FOLKS IN RESPONDING TO THE MANY INQUIRIES, BOTH PRO AND AGAINST THAT CAME TO ME. I'M LIKELY TO SUPPORT A RANK CHOICE VOTING WITH NONPARTISAN ELECTIONS IN NOVEMBER AND ANY OTHER WAY, I'M NOT INTERESTED IN IT NOW. I SEE THE IT PITFALLS AS MUCH AS THE PROMISE. THANK YOU.
02:59:10.327: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER
02:59:11.828: >> Councilmember Smith: ADDRESSI NG COUNCILMEMBER LUMM'S COMMENTS ABOUT MY INTENTION, I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE SPONSORS OF THE LEGISLATION WITH NONPARTISAN ELECTIONS SHOULD PROBABLY ASSUME, THAT I WILL BE BACKED INTO VOTING THE WAY THEY WT M TO WITUTEEING THIS LEGISLATION WELL IN ADVANCE. SECOND, I WILL -- I WOULD JUST THROW OUT THAT RANK CHOICE VOTING PARTICULARLY IN RACES -- WE HAVE MULTIPLE PEOPLE WITH MULTIPLE LABELS, WHETHER THEY ARE DEMOCRATIC, SOCIALIST, WHETHER THEY ARE INDEPENDENT, WHETHER THEY ARE PROESSIVE WHETHER THEYRE CONSERVATIVES, WE ARE NO LONGER VOTING -- FORCED TO JUST VOTE THE CLOSER OF THE EVILS THAT WE SEE. WE CAN RANK THE PEOPLE THAT WE WANT. I THINK THAT THIS -- THIS PUSH COMES FROM THE VOTERS, NOT POLITICIANS' CAMP AND THE WORK THAT THEY HAVE DONE, IT'S SUPPORTED  A GREAT DEAL OF ACADEMIC RESEARCH. I UNDERSTAND, YOU KNOW -- I DON'T THINK THIS IS A NO-BRAINER FOR ME, BUT I WILL TELL YOU BECAUSE I THINK ABOUT WHAT THE LATE GREAT GRAYSON KRAPOHL WOULD SAY ABOUT ELECTIONS, THIS IS MOST FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT THAT WE HAVE, AND WEHOULD NOT ALTER THESE THINGS WITHOUT A GREAT DEAL OF CONSIDERATION. THAT'S WHERE I AM WITH THAT. THANKS.
03:00:45.121: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
03:00:50.827: >> Councilmember Lumm: TO ABC COUNCIL MEMBER SMITH'S QUERY, THE PROPOSAL, THE BALLOT REFERENDUM PROPOSAL IS IDENTAL TO THE PROPOSAL THAT WAS PRESENTED TO COUNCIL ON JULY 1st, 2019. IT'S -- IT WAS SENT TO THE CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE TODAY, JUST TO BE UPDATED BASICALLY, BECAUSE IT WAS APPROVED LAST TIME, AND ONLY BY THE CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE, BUT BY THE A GOOD. 'S OFFICE. SO YOU WILL RECEIVE THE EXACT SAME PROPOSAL. THE EXACT SAME PROPOSAL THAT YOU SAID YOU WOULD CONSIDER FOR 2020. THAT'S WHY I THREW THAT OUT THERE. AND AS SOON AS THE DATES ARE ADJUSTED, I THINK THAT'S REALLY ALL THE ADJUSTMENT, BUT YOU CAN 7-1-19, TH'S IT AND OR I WILL SEND YOU T LINK, HAPPY TO DO THAT. AND I WOULD JUST SAY THAT -- WELL, I THINK I HAVE SAID ENOUGH. THE -- BUT JUST IN GENERAL, YOU KNOW, LET'S EXTEND OPPORTUNITIES TO AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIE. THOS NOUN FOR OFFICE AND TO VOTERS TO PARTICIPATE AND THAT ONLY HAPPENS IN NON- -- IF WE HAVE NONPARTISAN ELECTIONS, WE ARE REALLY HONEST, THEN -- AND IF WE HAVE OUR ELECTIONS IN NOVEMBER. I -- I CAN'T HONESTLY SEE ANY RAONAL ARGUMEN FOR NOT SAYING WE WANT THESE DECISIONS TO OCCUR IN THE AUGUST LOWER VOTER TURNOUTS VERSUS A GENERAL ELECTION. HOW IS THAT NOT A GOOD THING? HAD.
03:02:45.341: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
03:02:46.576: >> Councilmember Ramlawi YES, JUSTOCHO MY COLLEAGUE'S STATEMENT, COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, THE BALLOT PROPOSAL WE ARE BRINGING TO DISCUSS ON MONDAY IS EXACTLY WHAT WE HAVE SEEN BEFORE. THERE'S NO NEW SURPRISES IN THERE. IT'S THE DATES AND YOU ARE ON RECORD, COUNCILMEMBER SMITH, SAYING THAT Y WOULD SUPPORT THIS IN A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. AND WE HAVE ONE OF THE BIGGEST PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS OF OUR LIFETIME COMING UP. SO THERE'S NO BETTER OPPORTUNITY BUT TO POSE THIS QUESTION TO THE VOTER THIS NOVEMBER. THIS COUNCIL LIKES TO PRIDE ITSELF ON INCLUSIVITY, AND LET'S SEE IT. LET'S PUTT TO THE VOTERS ONE AND FOR ALL. WE TRIED TO DO THAT ALREADY, BUT WE HAVE BEEN VETOED. WE ASKED THE VOTERS ON A LOT OF THINGS AND I THINK AS YOU JUST SAID, THE LATE GREAT 4th WARD REP THAT VOTING IS A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT THAT WE HAVE, AND WHAT BETTER WAY TO DO IT THAN JUST TO GO THERE AND ASK THEM, AND SETTLE THE ARGUMENT ONCE AND FOR ALL. I JUST HAVE TO SAY THAT WHAT WE HAVE WITH RANK CHOICE VOTING. WE ARE PUTTING THE CART BEFORE THE HORSE. IT'S STILL NOTERMISSIBLE AT THE STATE LEVEL. WE HAVE VERY BIG LANGUAGE THAT WE ARE SENDING TO THE VOTERS TO VOTE ON, AND I DON'T THINK IT'S A FORM OF GOOD GOVERNMENT AND I DON'T THINK IT ACHIEVES THE GOALS THAT ARE DESCRIBED IN DOING SUCH. SO, YOU KW, OVER 30% OF VOTERS IDENTIFY AS INDEPENDENT. THEY DON'T IDENTIFY AS DEMOCRATIC OR REPUBLICAN. OVER 30%, THAT'S A BIG PART OF OUR WORLD -- OF OUR COUNTRY, OF OUR COMMUNITY. WOULD DON'T INTIFY WITH PARTY LABELS. IF WE ARE TALKING ABOUT INCLUSION AND DIVERSE DEAND REPRESENTATION OF MINORITIES. THEN LET'S OPEN IT UP AND LET'S HAVE NONPARTISAN ELECTIONS. AND FRANKLY, IT'S THAT SIMPLE. AND WHAT WE ARE SEEING NOW IS NOT GOOD FOR DEMOCRACY. WITH ERR SEWE AREEEING A LOT OFY BEING SPENT AND WELL OVER $260,000 WAS SPENT ON THIS PRIMARY ALONE. $260,000! IF THAT'S NOT ALARMING TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC, THEY ARE NOT PAYING ATTENTION.
03:05:43.119: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
03:05:43.987: >> Councilmember Hayner:  IT'S GOING TO SOUND REDUNDANT. I WAS GOING TO THANK COUNCIL MEMBER SMITH TO REMIND US OF COUNCILMAN KRAPOHL'S CONCERNS OVER THE SANCTITY OF THE ACT OF VOTING. IF I RECALL CORRECTLY, HE WAS IN A TIGHT THREE-WAY RACEN WAS RACE NOT A MAJORITY.H A PLURALITY AND HE MAY WELL NOT HAVE SERVED UNDER A RANK CHOICE VOTING SYSTEM AND I CERTAINLY -- YOU KNOW THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A SHAME. AND I THINK WE HAVE HAD -- YOU KNOW, WE HAD THE HAD THE RESULTD WITH THE BRIEF EXTENT, WITH THE HUMAN RIGHTS PARTY AND SO ON, AND WITHOUT IT. AND IHINK ITS TIME WIL COME BUT I DON'T THINK THAT TIME IS NOW.
03:06:33.770: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER NELSON?
03:06:38.374: >> Councilmember Nelson: THANK YOU, MAYOR. I JUST WANT TO COMMENT THAT COUNCIL RAMLAWI BROUGHT UP A POINT THAT I HADN'T THOUGHT OF, WHICH IS A SIGNIFICANT ONE THAT NOW THAT WE KNOW JUST HOW MUCH MONEY CAN BE INVESTED IN THESE KINDS OF RACES, THE IDEA OF THERE BEING TWO CONTESTS BOTH IN AUGUST AND NOVEMBER, MEANS THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT MEANS TO MAKE THIS PLAY OUT. AND I JUST HAVE A LOT OF CONCERNS WITH THE IDEA THAT WE ARE FRAMING AND OPENING UP ALL KINDS OF OPTIONS. ALL ARE NOT ALL AVAILABLE OPEN THE SAME BALLOT. AND I'M REALLY, REALLY SURPRISED THAT I'M NOT HEARING MORE CONCNS ABOUT HOW STUDENTS ARE CUT OFF IN AUGUST, AND I THINK I SAW A DEMONSTRATION IN MARCH, JACKIE'S OFFICE OVERWHELMED WITH BALLOTS AND STUDENTS WANTING TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY. WE KNOW THAT STUDENTS WHO ARE IN TOWN WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN ELECTIONS. THEY ARE ENERGIZED. AND IF WE HAD OUR ELECTIONS IN NOVEMB, IFE HAD RANK CHOICE VOTING WHERE IT'S THE ONE AND DONE IN NOVEMBER, I COULD SUPPORT THAT. I -- AS FAR AS THIS BEING A HYPOTHETICAL, I -- WHEN I READ THE HOUSE BILLS, I WAS JUST -- I WAS JUST SORT OF TRYING TO VISUALIZE. OKAY, WE WILL HAVE RANK CHOICE VOTING IN AUGUST, IN THE PRIMARY AND RANK CHOICEOTING IN NOMBER AND THEY HAVE TO BE SEPARATE BALLOTS. IT JUST IS -- IT'S STRANGE TO ME THAT WE WOULD DO THIS. AND I ALSO BELIEVE THAT THERE WOULD BE TIME, CERTAINLY IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS TO PUT THIS ON A BALLOT BEFORE -- IN THE EVENTUALITY THAT THE STATE PERMITTED IT, IF IT WAS ALREADY PERMITTED AND WE KNEW WHAT THE ACTUAL STATE LAW WAS GNGO LOOK LIKE, BECAUSE THE HOUSE BILLS THAT ARE UP NOW ARE NOT NECESSARILY THE ONES THAT WILL EVENTUALLY BE PASSED. SO I APPRECIATE MY COLLEAGUES' COMMENTS ON THIS ISSUE. I SUPPORT RANK CHOICE VOTING. I DON'T THINK IT MAKES SENSE IN A THREE-WAY RACE TO WIN NOT HAVING EARPED OVER 50% OF THE VOTE. THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. WE NEED TO HAVE SOLUTION FOR THAT AND I REALLY DO THINK THAT THE SOLUTION IS MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S SOME KIND OF CHOICE IN NOVEMBER. THANK YOU.
03:09:12.395: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
03:09:14.831: >> Councilmember Griswold: MOST OF WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY WAS SAID ALREADY. IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE CONCEP OF RANK CHOICE VOTING IS VERY GOOD. I SUPPORT RANK CHOICE VOTING BUT WE CAN'T PUT IT ON TOP OF THE SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE IN ANN ARBOR, AND WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT ANN ARBOR IS ONE OF ONLY THREE COMMUNITIES IN MICHIGAN WITH AUGUSTRIMARY ELECTIONS BASED ON PARTY. WHEN WE COME IN LINE WITH THE REST OF THE STATE OF MICHIGAN, THEN I THINK THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT RANK CHOICE VOTING, BUT WE ARE NOT THERE. AND FROM A PRACTICALITY STANDPOINT, IT JUST WON'T WORK. THANK YOU.
03:10:03.045: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMR HAYN, I BELIEVEOU HAVE SPEN TWICE ALRDY. I HAD A QUESTION FOR THE CLERK.
03:10:11.220: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
03:10:12.221: >> Councilmember Hayner:  IS THIS CORRECT WHAT I'M HEARING THAT RANK CHOICE VOTING REQUIRED A SEPARATE BALLOT. DOES IT REQUIRE A SEPARATE TABULATION METHOD? MY UNDERSTANDING WAS THAT WE WERE SET UP FOR THIS IN NEED BE. THANK YOU FOR INDULGING MY QUESTION.
03:10:28.571: >> Clerk Beaudry: OUR CURRENT TECHNOLOGY THAT WE USE TO TAB EWTABULATE VOTES DOES NOT HAVE RANK CHOICE VOTING. I UNDERSTAND THE CITY OF FERNDALE HAS IT IN THEIR CONSTITUTION FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND THEY ARE WAITING FOR DECISIONAND IMPROVED TECHNOLOGY BEFORE THEY CAN IMPLEMENT IT.
03:10:50.893: >> Councilmember Hayner: WOULD THIS REQUIRE NOT JUST THE PRINTING OF A NEW TYPE OF BALLOT, ABOUT THE A NEW TABULATION SYSTEM AND SO ON? WOULD WE BE A -- BE ABLE TO GIT STATE OR FEDERAL GRANTS FOR THAT?
03:11:05.074: >> Clerk Beaudry: IT WOULD DEPENDING WHETHER THE VENDOR, IF THERE WAS DEMAND, IF THEY COULD KE SOFTWARE IMPVEMENTS STOTT EXISTING SCANNERS. IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE SCANNERS COULDN'T DO IT. THE PROGRAM THAT WILL WE HAVE DOESN'T CONTEMPLATE THAT TYPE COUNTING.
03:11:19.622: >> Councilmember Hayner:  OH, OKAY. THANK YOU.
03:11:22.425: >> Clerk Beaudry: MM-HMM.
03:11:23.826: >> Councilmember Grand: MR. THOM AS ALSO LOOKED INTO THIS QUESTION. SOMETHG. BE ABLE TO ADD
03:11:34.737: >> YEAH, I DID. AND THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT, YOU KNOW, MACHINES HAVE THE -- HAVE THE TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES TO DO IT. THEY JUST DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY RIGHT NOW TO DO IT. SO I -- I WOULD AGREE WITH THE CLERK.
03:11:52.855: >> Mayoraylor: FURER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
03:12:00.796: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. MS. BEAUDRY, FORGIVE ME FOR MY IGNORANCE. IN I ANONPARTISAN ELECTION IN WHICH MORE THAN TWO PEOPLE ARE RUNNING IS THERE PRIMARY AND THENTHEN AND A GENERAL?
03:12:22.685: >> Clerk Beaudry: YES, TWO WILL MOVE FORWARD TO THE GENERAL, WHEN THERE'S A THREE PARTY RACE.
03:12:27.423: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  SO LISTENING TO OBJECTIONS RAISED ABOUT RANK CHOICE VOTING, I'M LISTENING TO THE COST IS TOO HIGH IN TERMS OF THE NEED TO FUND A SIX-MONTH CAMPAIGN, THE TOLL ON INDIVIDUALS IS TOO HIGH IN ORDER TO RUN A SIX-MONTH CAMPAIGN. THERE'S FEAR THAT IN PARTISAN RANKED CHOICE VOTING SCENARIO, WE WOULD CONSOLIDATE POWER TO ONLY THOSE REPRESENTED BY ONE PARTY OR WHO ARE WILLING TO RUN IN A CERTAIN PARTY'SLECTION OR PRIMARY. YOU KNOW, I THINK THERE IS A -- THERE'S A LOGICAL RESPONSE TO EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THESE, AND ANY OF THOSE PROBLEMS THAT WE RAISED, NONPARTISAN ELECTIONS ARE NOT A SNAKE OIL THAT WASHES OVER THEM. IF WE HAVE NONPARTISAN ELECTIONS WE WILL BY THEIR NATURE VERY LIKELY HAVE PRIMARIES AND GERALS. IT WL BEHE SE WAY, AND, IN FACT, WE WILL PROBABLY SPEND MORE MONEY, BECAUSE THE IMPORTANCE OF IDENTIFYING OURSELVES BY OUR VALUES BECOMES THAT MUCH HARDER WITHOUT PARTY LABEL. YOU KNOW, I THINK WHEN -- WHEN POLITICAL SCIENTISTS DISCUSSED ELECTORAL SYSTEMS, THERE'S NEV GOOD AND BAD. THERE'S NEVER PERFECT. THERE'S LEVEL OF PREFERENCE. AND THAT'S BECAUSE ELECTORAL SYSTEMS EXIST ON A SPECTRUM OF EASYILY MALLEABLE AND CORRUPTIBLE TO GOOD AND REPRESENTATIVE AND TRUE TO DEMOCRACY. AND UP AND DOWN THE LINE, STUDIES OF RANK CHOICE VING IN ACTION PROVE THAT THEY PRODUCE MORE REPRESENTATIVE OUTCOMES OF THE PEOPLE. AND IF THAT'S THE GOAL OF AN ELECTION, THEN LET'S ADOPT THIS SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES THAT FOR US. YOU KNOW, FERNDALE HAS HAD THIS AS PART OF ITS CHARTER FOR TEN YEARS BECAUSE THEY EAGERLY AWAITED AN OPPORTUNITY INJEC MORE DEMOCRACY INTO THEIR SYSTEM. I DON'T THINK IT'S OUT OF THE REALM THAT WE ALSO TRY TO BE A LEADER IN ELECTION REFORM. IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT ALL OF THE ACTIVES AND ADVOCATES AND ORGANIZERS WHO PUSHED THROUGH THE END OF GERRYMANDERING IN THE STATE OF MICHIGAN HAVE TURNED THEIR ATTENTION AND FOCUS TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF RANK CHOICE VOTING IN THE STATE OF MICHIGAN. IT'S BECAUSE THEY REPRESENT THE SAME VALUES, TRUE REPRESENTATION. THE ABILITY TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS IN AUGUST AND NOVEMBER. SO THAT'S ALL I WILL SAY ON THAT. IT'S -- THAT'S ALL I WILL SAY ON THAT.
03:15:10.152: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
03:15:11.053: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT FERNDALE AND THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE STATE, HAVE NONPARTISAN ELECTIONS AND WE WOULD NOT BE REQUIRED, BASED ON THE LANGUAGE THAT WE ADOPTED, TO HAVE AUGUST PRIMARIES EVEN IF THERE WERE THREE PEOPLE WHO WERE RUNNING FOR A POSITN, JUST LIKE THE SCHOOL BOARD, YOU HAVE THE ELECTION IN NOVEMBER AND THE TOP VOTE GETTERS WIN AND WITH RANK CHOICE VOTING, YOU WOULD HAVE THAT EXTRA LAYER TO CONSIDER THE CANDIDATES SO THAT THE WINNER DID HAVE A MAJORITY OF THE VOTES.
03:15:54.730: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, I BELIEVE YOU HAVE SPOKEN TWICE ALREADY.
03:16:03.172: >> Clerk Beaudry: MAYOR?
03:16:04.440: >> Mayor Taylor: MS. BEAUDRY.
03:16:05.074: >> Clerk Beaudry: IF IT'S STILL A PARTISAN ELECTION, YOU WOULD HAVE TO DETERMINE THE CANDIDATE FOR THE NOVEMBER BALLOT IN AUGUST. THE LAW WOULD NOT ALLOW FOR MULTIPLE DEMOCRATS TO RUN IN NOVEMBER.
03:16:19.321: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
03:16:19.922: >> Councilmember Hayner:  SO THE STATE -- I'M SORRY.
03:16:25.794: >> Mayor Taylor: FOLLOW-ON QUESTION.
03:16:26.662: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YOU CAN ONLY HAVE -- UNDER A PARTISAN, YOU CAN ONLY HAVE ONE PERSON FROM EACH PARTY IN NOVEMBER, SO THERE COULD BE THREE PEOPLE ON THE BALLOT IN NOVEMBER AS LONG AS THEY WERE FROM SEPARATE PARTIES, B UNDER NONPARTISAN ELECTIONS, YOU COULD HAVE THREE PEOPLE ON THE BALLOT WITH OR WITHOUT RANK CHOICE VOTING IN NOVEMBER; IS THAT CORRECT?
03:16:44.914: >> Clerk Beaudry: THAT'S CORRECT. THE PARTISAN PRIMARY IN AUGUST IS NO NO, MA NO, MA NOMINATE THR THE NOVEMBER BALLOT.
03:16:56.825: >> Councilmember Hayner: OKAY. THANK YOU.
03:16:59.161: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND?
03:17:01.897: >> Councilmember Grand: DOES COUNCILMEMBER LUMM WANT TO SPEAK?
03:17:05.935: >> Councilmember Lumm: I HAVE SPOKEN TWICE. I APPRECIATE YOUR KINDNESS. I -- I WILL BE SUPER QUICK. LIKE TWO SENTENCES IF I MAY. THANKS. OKAY. THANK YOU, EVERYBODY. I JUST -- TWO POINTS. WITH NONPARTISAN, THE DECIDING ELECTION WOU ALWAYS BE IN NOVEMBER. IF THERE'S TWO CANDIDATES ARE LESS, THERE IS NO PRIMARY. IF THERE ARE MORE THAN TWO CANDIDATES, THERE'S AN AUGUST PRIMARY WITH THE TOP TWO ON THE BALLOT IN NOVEMBER. SO NOVEMBER IS THE DECIDING ELECTION AND THAT'S A GOOD THING AND MY OTHER POINT, WITH THE SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE NOW, RUNNING IN NOVEMBER, ALL THE CANDIDATING UNOPPOSED. THAT'S IT. THANK YOU FOR INDULGING ME.
03:17:54.750: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
03:17:56.218: >> Councilmember Grand: I APOLOGIZE FOR NOT APROVIDING SOME OTHER CONTEXT BETWEEN THE STATE -- THE STATE OF -- THE PROPOSED STATE LAW AND NOARTISAN. I WAS -- I WAS ENCOURAGED BY LEADERS THEY STATE LEVEL WHO HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH BOTH AS MENTIONED, VOTERS NOT POLITICIANS AND NOW WORKING ON THIS ISSUE OF RANK CHOICE VOTING THAT IT WOULD BE INCREDIBLY HELPFUL TO THOSE TRYING TO PULL THROUGH LEGISLATION IN NOVEMBER IF MORE COMMUTIES CE FORRD AND ADOPTED BALLOTS LIKE THE ONE PROPOSED THIS EVENING. I WAS TOLD BY THOSE AT THE STATE LEVEL THAT THE LANGUAGE -- I BELIEVE IT'S ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES MENTIONED EARLIER IS NOT SET IN STONE AND SO LOOKING AT DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES THAT ADOPTED THIS THEY COULD CHANGE A/K/A DA ALL THE COMMUNITIESLL THAT HAVE EXPRESSED THIS PREFERENCE. I BELIEVE THAT OUR COMMUNITIES IS -- IS -- IS INTELLIGENT ENOUGH TO -- TO BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT SUCH A HYPOTHETICAL THAT IF ENABLING LEGISLATION AND ALLOWS IT, WE WANT TO MOVE FORWARD AND SO ALL IT'S DOING IS PREPARING FOR THAT HOPEFUL EVENTUALITY. SO IT'S PRETTY LOW RISK. YOU KNOW, I THINK THE LAST TWO YEARS HAVE SHOWN -- MAYBE NOT FROM MY COLLEAGUES' PERSPECTIVE, BUT I'M PATIENT, THE TIME FOR RANK CHOICE VOTING WILL COME. IF IT DOESN'T COME TONIG, I DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE MANY OF YOU HAVE EXPRESSED THAT YOU ARE IN FAVOR OF IT, AND IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE SEPARATE FROM NONPARTISAN AND THE IDEA THAT THERE HAS SOME SORT OF QUID PRO QUO, LIKE IF YOU PASS NONPARTISAN, I WILL PASS RANK CHOICE VOTING, IS INCREDIBLY DISAPPOINTING TO ME. THE FACT THAT -- THE FACT THA I HA BEEN CALLED DISHONEST BY A NUMBER OF YOU HERE, THE FACT THAT MANY OF YOU HAVE ACCUSED PEOPLE WHO WON AN ELECTION BY SIZABLE MARGINS OF BUYING IT IS ALSO DISAPPOINTING. AND TO LET LET YOUR FEELINGS ABT TH COL YOUR VIEW OF VOTERS AND WHETHER THEY WANT TO HAVE A BETTER FORM OF DEMOCRACY IS ALSO DISAPPOINTING ESPECIALING DURING A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION YEAR BECAUSE I HEARD FROM MANY OF YOU HAVE THAT WE SHOULD LET VOTERS DECIDE THESE IMPORTANT DECISIONS. SO I'M SORRY THAT -- I'M SORRY TO HEAR THIS FEEDBACK. I CERTAINLY -- FOR THE LAST NUMBER OF WEEKS, I HAVE BEEN HEARING -- I HAVE OFFERED THAT IF ANYONE HAD ANY QUESTIONS, PLEASE LET ME KNOW. IF ANYONE WANTS TO COSPONSOR THIS, PLEASE LET ME KNOW. AND UNTIL THE LANGUAGE -- I HEARD FROM ONE OF YOU. SO NONE OF THESE CONCERNS WERE EXPRESSED WHEN I -- WHEN I SAID THAT MY INTENT WAS TO BRING THIS FORWARD BACK ON JULY JULY 20th MEETING. SO I'M SORRY THAT YOU ARE TAKING OUT YOUR FEELINGS THIS WAY ON OUR VOTERS.
03:21:08.177: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN MOTION. ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE. STARTING WITH ME.
03:21:27.196: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
03:21:29.264: >> Councilmember Eaton: NO.
03:21:29.865: >> Councilmember Nelson:  YES.
03:21:36.171: >> Councilmember Smith: YES.

03:21:53.422: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES.
03:21:55.357: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION FAILS.
03:22:00.529: >> Mayor Taylor: DC-2, RESOLUTION TO EXTEND RESOLION 20-194 - RESUTION TO APPVE DOWNTO STREET CLOSURES FOR RESTAURANT AND RAIL USE DURING THE TIME OF MANDATED PHYSICAL DISTANCING. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER SMITH. SECONDED BY RAMLAWI. DISCUSSION OF DC-2. COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
03:22:15.777: >> Councilmember Griswold: I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS. I THINK IT'S BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL AND VERY HELPFUL TO THE FINANCIAL WELL-BEING OF OUR BUSINESSESOWNTOWN AS MUCH AS IT POSSIBLY CAN DURING THIS PANDEMIC. I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT THE VEHICULAR TRAFFIC VOLUME IS RIGHT NOW, COMPARED TO NORMAL. I KNOW THAT WE HEARD THAT THE VEHICLE TRAFFIC AROUND TOWN WAS AT 50%, BUT THAT WAS MEASURED THE WEEK BEFORE THE GOVERNOR LISTED -- LIFTED THE STAY HOME ORDER, AND SECONDLY, ARE THERE ANY ARRANGEMENTS BEING MADE FOR HOME FOOTBALL GAMES BECAUSE I KNOW DURING HOME FOOTBALL GAMES, WE CLOSE THE CROSSWALKS ON ANN ARBOR SALIM ROAD AND PUT UP BARRICES. WOUL WE LEAVE MAIN STREET CLOSED OR WHAT WE DO DURING HOME FOOTBALL GAMES AND WE HAVE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THAT FIRST STREET IS -- IS MAINLY CLOSED FOR CONSTRUCTION AT THIS TIME.
03:23:25.614: >> Mayor Taylor: ANY STAFF RESPONSE TO THAT?
03:23:28.583: >> City Admin. Crawford: MAYOR, I'M NOT AWARE THAT THERE ARE TRAFFIC COUNTS GOING ON NOW I THE DOWNTOWN. I CAN SHARE ANECDOTALLY, YOU KNOW, -- I CAN ONLY SHARE ANECDOTALLY THAT IT HAS NOT BEEN HEAVY. IN REGARDS TO THE FOOTBALL PLANNING, THE SCHEDULE HAS JUST COME OUT AND IT SURPRISED ME THAT SOME OF THE GAMES -- ONE OF THE GAMES IS NOW DURING -- BERE SEPTEMBER1st. IT W NOT A HOME -- A HOME GAME WAS NOT PLANNED BEFORE THAT BEFORE. I THINK COUNCIL CAN ANTICIPATE A REQUEST FOR A ROAD CLOSURE COMING UP ON THAT, HOWEVER, THIS IS A FLUID YEAR AND HOW -- HOW THEY ARE GOING TO PROCEED WITH THE FOOTBALL GAMES, WE STILL DON'T KNOW. SO I MEAN, YOU ARE ASKING GOOD QUESTIONS BUT I DON'T THINK WE HAVE THE ANSWERS TO SOME OF THEM YET.
03:24:14.396: >> Couilmember Gswold: OKAY. THANKS.
03:24:19.267: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
03:24:20.469: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU. THIS -- THIS RESOLUTION ASKS THAT IT LASTS UNTIL SEPTEMBER 21st, 2020, AS YOU ALL SAW, WE SAW MANY REQUESTS FROM DOWNTOWN BUSINESS OWNERS AND OTHERS IN THE COMMUNITY TO, YOKNOW EXTEND IT AS LONG AS POSSIBLE. IS IT A SIMPLE MATTER TO -- SHOULD WE MODIFY THIS NOW OR IS IT A SIMPLE MATTER TO BRING THIS BACK AND SAY, LOOK, IT'S WORKING OUT. WE STILL HAVE THE COVID CONCERNS. YOU KNOW, THE UNIVERSITY HAS CHANGED OR ANYTHING THAT'S DYNAMIC ABOUT THE SITUATION, WELL, CLEARLY THERE ARE MANY THINGS THAT ARE. AND THEN -- AND IS IT A SIMPL MATTER FOR US TO EXTEND THIS YET AGAIN OR MAYBE SHOULD WE MODIFY IT YET AGAIN AND EXTEND IT UNTIL OCTOBER SOMETHING? I DON'T CARE EITHER WAY. IT SEEMS TO BE WORKING WITHOUT FOR PEOPLE. ANECDOTALLY, I HAVE SEEN MORE CONFUSION AROUND THESE TEMPORARY STREET CLOSURES FOR THE HEALTHY STREETS. I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY PEOPLE I HAVE SEEN START TO TURN DOWN A STRE THAT THEY THOUGHT W A STREET, SEE THE CLOSED SIGN AND THEN THERE'S A -- NOW THEY ARE PARALLEL TO THE TRAFFIC AND THEY ARE TRYING TO BACK THEIR WAY OUT. THEY DON'T KNOW IF THEY CAN GO DOWN THE STREET. I KNOW -- THAT'S HEALTHY STREETS PROGRAM, NOT THIS, I RECOGNIZE THAT. I THINK THAT'S GOING TO CAUSE MORE CONFUSION THAN THIS. I WONDER IF ANYBODY HAS ANY OPINION ON MOVINGO BOND SEPTEMBER 21st? I'M THROWING IT OUT THERE.
03:25:47.389: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
03:25:48.457: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, MAYOR. AND THANK YOU TO TOM CRAWFORD AND COUNCILMEMBER LUMM. WE HAVE BEEN MEETING WITH THE DDA, THE MERCHANT ASSOCIATIONS EVERY TWO WEEKS, EVERY SECOND OR EVERY OTHER THURSDAY, WE HAVE BEEN MTING TO ASSESS THE SITUATION AND THE NEEDS, AND IF ANYTHING NEEDS ADJUSTING. SO WHEN WE BROUGHT THIS RESOLUTION FORTH, WE WERE COGNIZANT OF THE HOME FOOTBALL GAMES AND AT THAT TIME, THE FIRST FOOTBALL GAME WAS ON SEEMBER 26th. SO I HAD ASKED FOR THIS TO BE A SUNSET PROVISION OF THE 21st, SO THAT'S THE SITUATION PERIODICALLY, AS WE HAVE, AND BE READY TO PIVOT WHETHER IT IS TO EXTENT IT OR AT THE DISCRETION OF THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR, PULL THE PLUG ON IT IF THINGS GOT TOO -- TOO HOT AND UNSAFE. SO, AFTER THIS WAS DRAFTED, THE FOOTBALL GAMES WERE ANNOUNCED AND THEY MOVED UP THE DATES AND NOW FIRST DATE IS ON THE 5 5th OF SEPTEMBER. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT TS N'T BE FOLKS IN ATTENDANCE OR VERY FEW IN ATTENDANCE. SO I'M NOT SURE HOW THE OTHER CLOSURES, IF THEY ARE GOING TO HAPPEN WILL HAPPEN, BECAUSE THERE WON'T BE 110,000 PEOPLE IN THAT STADIUM, OBVIOUSLY AND I DON'T KNOW IF THEY ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO PLAY A FULL SEASON, BASED ON WHAT IS GOING O I OTHER SPORTS. SO, YOU KNOW, IN MY -- MY TRAIN OF THOUGHT IS TO CONTINUE TO MONITOR THIS, CONTINUE TO WORK WITH TOM CRAWFORD AND COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, THE DDA, THE ASSOCIATIONS, AND EVALUATE THE SITUATION EVERY TWO WEEKS, AND MAKE -- MAKE OUR DECISION BASED ON REALTIME INFORMATION. AND TO GO AS FAR AS NOVEMBER 1st, RIGHT NOW, I THINK WOULD BE -- IT WOULD BE A BIG LEAP OF FAITH AND I THINK IT'S MORE SAFE TO TAKE IT IN INCREMENTS, SMALLER INCREMENTS. WE HEARD FRO SMALL BUSINESSES THATHIS HAS BEEN A HUGE SHOT TO THEIR ARM AND HOPEFULLY WE'LL -- WE'LL ALLOW THEM TO MAKE IT THROUGH THIS. I MEAN, I TALKED TO MANY FOLKS IN THE INDUSTRY AND IT'S NO SECRET, I OWN A RESTAURANT DOWN HERE. I HAVE BEEN DOWN HERE EVERY DAY. I HAVE BN EVE DAY SINCE COVID STARTED. I ONLY CLOSED FOR THREE WEEKS DURING LATE MAY. IT'S BAD DOWN HERE. WE DON'T HAVE THE PEOPLE WORKING DOWNTOWN. WE DON'T HAVE A CAPTIVE AUDIENCE. OUR BUSINESS LAUNCH IS SHOT. CATERING IS SHOT. I KNOW SOME BAR OWNERS THAT ARE GOING TO BE GOING OUT OF BUSINESS. THEY ARE ABLE TOTAY IN BUSINESS NOW, BECAUSE OF THE OUTDOOR SEATING, BUT ONCE THE WEATHER TURNS, THEY ARE CLOSING DOWN. AND MANY OF THEM ARE CONTEMPLATING WHETHER THEY ARE GOING TO BE COMING BACK. AND SO, YOU KNOW, I MIGHT GO BEYOND THREE MINUTES BUT APOLOGIZE. I WANTED TO GIVE A LITTLE HAVE BN SNDING QUITE A BITE I OF TIME ON THIS, PROBABLY UPWARDS OF OVER 50 HOURS THIS SUMMER WORKING ON THIS ALONE, AND SO WHAT WE HAVE BEEN HEARING IS THAT LIKE MY BUSINESS, 85% OF OUR SALES ARE - FORE, IT'S THE GO, THE 85% BUT FOR OTHER BUSINESSES, IT'S 85% OUTSIDE. NOT VERY MANY PEOPLE ARE COMFORTABLE EATING INDOORS. AND SO I THINK THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO HELP THOSE WHO NEED IT THE MOST. AND LET'S NOT FORGET WHAT HAS CREATED DOWNTOWN'S SUCCESS FOR THE LAST 15, 20 YEARS, IT'S THE SMALL LOCAL BUSINESSES. IT'S RESTAURANTS. IT'S COFFEE SHOPS. THAT'S THE REASON TECH COMPANIES WANTED TO RELOCATE IN DOWNTOWN AND PAY REALLY EXPENSIVE RENTS IS SO THAT THEIR STAFF, THEIR EMOYEES N TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE DOWNTOWN AMENITIES. SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE TRY TO PROTECT THAT BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT HAS MADE OUR DOWNTOWN RICH AND VIBRANT. AND SO YOU KNOW, WE WERE JUST GOING TO COME BACK AND LOOK AT THIS IN A FEW WEEKS AND SEE IF IT NEEDS TO  EXTENDED. I APOLOGIZE FOR GOING A LITTLE LONG, BUT THIS IS IMPORTANT TO ME AND IT'S SOMETHING I HAVE BEEN WORKING ON SINCE -- SINCE MAY. THANK YOU.
03:31:00.034: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
03:31:01.503: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU. THAT WAS WELL AND HE WILL ENTER CONSEQUENTLY PUT, COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, AND I WOULD LIKE TO THK YOU FOR TAKING THE LEAD ON THIS. AND I'M HAPPY TO BE A COSPONSOR. I THINK -- YOU KNOW, AS WE ALL KNOW, WE ALL FULLY APPRECIATE THAT -- THAT EXTENDING THE EXISTING STREET CLOSURES THAT HAVE BEEN IN PLACE DOWNTOWN IS SUPPORTING BUSINESSES IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT OF SOCIAL DISTANCING AND THAT'S A GOOD THING AND WHEN WE APPROVE THESE CLOSURES ON JUNE 1st, IT WAS DONE AT THE REQUEST OF THE DOWNTOWN MERCHANT ASSOCIATIONS WHO HAD POLLED THEIR MEMBERS. AND, AT THAT TIME AS HAS BEEN STATED, WE APPRECIATE THE CLOSURES ON AUGUST 23rd OR WHEN THE RESTRICTIONS OPEN GATHERINGS WERE LIFTED BY GOVERNOR WHITMER. THIS EXTENDS -- BUT, AGAIN, AS COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI SHARED, THIS IS -- THESE PROPOSALS ARE BEING BROUGHT FORWARD AND ADJUSTED A BIT THROUGH VERY THOUGHTFUL COLLABORATION PROCESS ASSOCIATION REPRESENTATIVES TO THROUGH EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS, THE DDA, AND MR. CRAWFORD, VARIOUS CITY STAFF, AND -- AND, AGAIN, AS COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI SHARED, THIS IS BEING MONITORED AND EVALUATED EVERY COUPLE OF WEEKS. SO, YOU KNOW, IT'S A PRETTY NIMBLE AND VERY THOUGHTL PROCESS. THE -- SO THIS 30-DAY EXTENSION, AGAIN, IS UNTIL THE 21st OF SEPTEMBER OR WHEN THE RESTRICTIONS ARE LIFTED BY THE GOVERNOR. AND IT DOES COVER THE SAME STREETS FOR THE SAME TIME, FROM FRIDAY AT 2 P.M. TO SUNDAY AT 8 P.M. WE HAVE -- WE HAVE BEEN RECEIVG LOTS ANDOTS O EMAILS ABOUT THIS AND SUPPORT OF THIS. SOME FOLKS HAVE SUGGESTED -- IT HAS BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL, TO EXTEND IT FURTHER, YOU KNOW TO A THURSDAY OR ALL WEEK, BUT, AGAIN, WHAT IS BEING BROUGHT FORWARD REFLECTS THESE CONVERSATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS. AND ON THIS, THE MERCHANT ASSOCIATIONS HAVE ASKED FOR THE EXTENSION. AND AGAIN, THESE EMAILS FROM FOLKS CERTAINLY SUPPORT THIS. AS WE ALL KNOW, THE PANDEMIC HAS SEVERELY IMPACTED OUR LOCAL BUSINESSES, AND COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, OBVIOUSLY KNOWS AND HAS JUST EXPLAINED TO US HOW SIGNIFICANT THIS IMPACT IS AND I WILL JUST SAY COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, WE ARE SO FORTUNATE TO HAVE YOUR REAL WORLD VOICE ON THIS. AND ON SO MANY BUSINESS ISSUES. SO THANK YOU. SO THIS IS ALL ABOUT SUPPORTING OUR LOCAL BUSINESSES, HELPING FACILITATE THEIR RECOVERY AND FRANKLY THEIR SURVIVAL. OBVIOUSLY, I'M FULLY SUPPORTIVE OF THIS EXTENSION, AND I APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU.
03:34:21.102: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
03:34:22.070: >> Councilmember Nelson: THANK YOU. I WOULD LIKE TO ASK TO BE ADDED AS A COSPONSOR. I'M VERY, VERY PLEASED THAT WE ARE ABLE TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN FOR THE BENEFIT OF OR DOWNTOWN BUSINESSES, AND I WOULD JUST LIKE TO ADD THAT I WANT TO THANK STAFF FOR THE EFFORTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGN ABOUT WEARs MASKS DOWNTOWN. I THINK THAT IS THE NIP SIDE OF IS COIN IS HAVING -- ALLOWING THESE ACTIVITIES DOWNTOWN AND ATTRACTING MORE PEOPLE DOWNTOWN, WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK WE ALL WANT TO SUPPORT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR BUSINESSES SURVIVE. THE NIP SIDE OF THAT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY THAT PEOPLE NEED TO TAKE WHEN THEY ARE WALKING AROUND ON THE SIDEWALKS AND ARE GETTING IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO PEOPLE RERE REALLY NEED TO BE CONSCIOUS OF HOW CLOSE WE ARE TO PEOPLE AND WEARING MASKS. I LOOK FORWARD TO ONGOING CITY EFFORTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT IS A REALITY. I'M GRATEFUL FOR ALL THE SIGNAGE THAT I HAVE SEEN AROUND TOWN REMINDING PEOPLE TO WEAR MASKS WHEN THEY ARE IN OUR DOWNTOWN WHERE PEOPLE TEND TO BE A BIT CLOSER TO EACH OTHER. THANYOU.
03:35:34.809: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
03:35:37.412: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. I -- I -- LAST WEEK, I HEARD CONCERNS ABOUT CONSISTENCY WITH MASKS, THAT SOME PEOPLE NOT FEELING SAFE DOWNTOWN. SO ABOUT A WEEK AGO I WAS BIKING WITH MY DAUGHTER AND I THOUG IF I FELT SAFE WITH HER GOING THROUGH DOWNTOWN, THAT WAS A PRETTY GOOD TEST OF SAFETY. AND I KNOW AS I HAVE BEEN DOWNTOWN MORE OFTEN AND REALLY LOOKING, I DO FEEL LIKE MASK COMPLIANCE IS UP. I HOPE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO EVAL WET AFTER AUGUST WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE ONE STUDENT MOVE-IN COMES BACK BECAUSE WE MAY WANT TO AFTERNOON TT WE ACTUALL WANT T DO THIS MORE DAYS IF WE HAVE MORE STUDENTS ON CAMPUS. WE STILL DON'T HAVE A GOOD SENSE OF EXACTLY HOW MANY OF THEM ARE COMING BACK OR NOT. AND THINK I WE'LL HAVE A GOOD SENSE OF NUMBERS AND IF IT MAKES SENSE TO HAVE MORE OF OUR STREETS OPEN  PEDESIANS AND CYCLISTS, AS WELL AS OUTDOOR EATING AND WE WILL HAVE A GOOD SENSE OF WHAT COMPLIANCE LOOKS LIKE. FROM THOSE WHO MOVE BACK INTO TOWN IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS. SO VERY PLEASED TO SUPPORT THIS, AND I APPRECIATE COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI'S PERSPECTIVE AS A DOWNTOWN BUSINESS OER.
03:36:59.093: >> Mayor Taylor: CNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI. I'M SORRY, COUNCILMEMBER GRAND, I INTERRUPTED YOU. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
03:37:04.999: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. AND THANKS TO MY COLLEAGUES FOR THEIR SUPPORT IN THIS, AND IT'S -- IT'S -- IT'S DEEPLY APPRECIATED. I FORGOT TO MENTION THAT PART OF THE WORKING GROUP THAT MEETS EVERY TWO WKS OFTEN MICEL RAINE FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN JOINS US TO FILL US IN ON WHAT THE UNIVERSITY IS DOING, AND WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO COLLABORATE, TOM CRAWFORD AND OTHERS, THE STAFF HAVE BEEN TRYING TO COLLABORATE WITH THE UNIVERSITY. SO WE -- WITH THE INFORMATION AND EDUCATION CAMPAIGNS WE ARE CONSISNT I UNDERSTANDING AND IN SYNC WITH EACH OTHER, AS TO WHAT WE'RE DOING AND HOW WE'RE DOING IT. I APOLOGIZE, WE ARE IN CONSTANT CONTACT WITH THE UNIVERSITY WITH MICHAEL RAINE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THE UNIVERSITY AND HOW THAT IMPACTS US. AND IT WAS GOINGO BE THIS WEEK HERE, I THINK UNIVERSITY WAS GOING TO HAVE A BETTER IDEA OF HOW MANY STUDENTS WERE GOING TO COME BACK TO CAMPUS. THIS WAS A WEEK THAT MICHAEL RAINE SAID THAT IT WOULD BE SHAPING UP FOR THEM IN TERMS OF THE INFORMATION THAT THEY CAN RELAY ON TO US, T WHAT THEY EXPECT THE POPULATION TO BE LIKE. BUT ISN'T A BIG CONSIDERATION THAT MY COLLEAGUE JUST BROUGHT UP, COUNCILMEMBER GRAND THAT THE SITUATION IS GOING TO CHANGE QUITE A BIT WHEN SCHOOL REOPENS, AND WE ARE, YOU KNOW, NOT NECESSARILY ON PINS AND NEEDLES, BUT WE KNOW IT'S GOING TO CHANGE DRASTICALLY. AND HOPEFULLY, IT REMAINS SAFE AND SO AGAIN, THAT'S ANOTHER REASON WHY WE MEET OFTEN AND WE WANT TO REVISIT THIS EVERY 30 DAYS TO SEE WHAT THE SITUATION IS LIKE BEFORE COMMITTING TO TOO MUCH. THINK EVERYONE DOES, THAT THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR DOES HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO TERMINATE THE PROGRAM AT ANY TIME HE FEELS THAT IT BECOMES UNSAFE, BUT AFTER AUGUST 30th, THE 31st, AND THE STUDENTS RETURN, WE WILL HAVE A CITY WITHIN A CITY, AND THERE'S GOING TO BE DIFFERENT NEEDS AND DIFFERENT RISK FACTORS BASED ON WHAT PART WE ARE TAING ABOUT. SO WHETHER IT'S FOR SOCIAL DISTANCING OR TO HELP THE SMALL BUSINESSES OR BOTH, THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT NUANCES AND EACH STREET IS BEING LOOKED AT BASED ON THOSE UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES. SO ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE BEING TALKED ABOUT IN DETAIL, LIKE I SAID EVERY TWO WEE AND IF ANYONE WANTS TO JOIN THAT, PLEASE REACH OUT TO MORA OR MR. CRAWFORD. I'M SURE IF YOU WANT TO JOIN THE CONVERSATION ON 309th -- I'M NOT SURE WHEN WE ARE MEETING NEXT. I APOLOGIZE, BUT I THINK IT'S NEXT THURSDAY. THE MORE THE MERRIER.
03:40:15.856: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCSION. LET ME SUGGEST WE PROBABLY TALKED THROUGH THIS ONE ENOUGH. ALL IN FAVOR THIS. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. DB-1, RESOLUTION TO APPROVE LIBERTY TOWNHOMES SITE PLAN AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT, 2658 W. LIBERTY ST. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER SMITH. SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN. DISCUSSION, PLEASE, O DB-1. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
03:40:41.215: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANKS, MR. HAYNER. BRIEFLY, I WAS SORT OF SHOCKED BY FIRST -- THE FIRST REPORT FROM PLANNING STAFF, AND NOT -- BUT NOT SURPRISED KNOWING THE SITE WELL AND THE AREA WELL. AND I'M NOT -- I'M NOT THRILLED WITH THE RESULTS THAT THEY CAME -- THAT CAME UP BETWEEN THE NEGOATIONS OF REWORKING THE WORKING THEENTRY WAY, NOT STRETT STRETCHING BECAUSE IT'S LAWFUL, BUT IN ANY EVENT, STRETCHING THE DEFINITION OF "SAFE FIRE ACCESS," WE ACTUALLY SAW THAT DOWN ON THE LOWER TOWN SITE WHERE THEY ARE GOING TO DRIVE RIGHT OVER THE ROUNDABOUT. SO I HE THE CONCERNS ABOUT TRAFFIC AND ACCESS TO THIS SEAT AND I SHARE THE ONES THAT STAFF SHARED. I'M -- I UNDERSTAND BUT NOT FULLY, HOW THEY HAVE BEEN CHANGED BY LIMITING ACCESS IN AND OUT OF THE SITE IN ONE DIRECTION BUT WHAT WAS MOST STARTLING TO ME THE REPORT WAS PROVIDING A MUCH NEEDED MARKETS RATE HOUSING, WHICH WE KNOW THAT MARKET RATE HOUSING IS NEEDED, BUT WE HAVE HAD SO MUCH BUILT IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS, THAT IT'S BEEN -- YOU KNOW, I KNOW THAT IT'S NOT MARKET RATE. IT'S ABOVE MARKET RATE. AND SO THE NOTION THAT THIS IS REARKET RE HOUSING TEL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT THE MONEY THAT IS SITTING OUT THERE TO BE SKIMMED OUT OF OUR COMMUNITY, BY PEOPLE WHO ARE WILLING TO BUILD ABOVE MARKET RATE, OR -- OR NEAR LUXURY OR LUXURY VERSUS WHAT WE REALLY NEED, WHICH IS WORKFORCE AND BELOW. I APPRECIATE THAT THIS IS PROVIDING THAT. IT'S ONE OF THOSE LITTLE SLOTS OF LAND THAT IF YOU NO HE WHEREE IT'S GOING, IT WOULDN'T BE FOR ME, BUT I HOPE THAT THE UNITS THAT ARE CONSTRUCTED IN SUCH A WAY THAT FOLKS CAN LIVE THAT CLOSE TO THE HIGHWAY AND I APPRECIATE THAT WE ARE -- THIS GREEN PARCEL THAT IS REA REALLY- IS REALLY GREEN IN ONLY. MY APOLOGIES TO THE NEIGHBORS WHO WILL HAVE CONSTANT U TURNS IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS. I THINK WE APPROVE THIS WITH THOSE CHANGES JUST TO ADD TO OUR -- AT TO OUR MIX OF HOUSING. -- ADD TO OUR MIX OF HOUSING. AND TO THAT END, SOMETIME IN THE NEXT MONTH, WE ARE GOING TO -- I WANT TO BRING FORWARD A RESOLUTION TO START TO DO A MORE COMPLETE SURVEY. MR. DELACOURSPOKE ABOUT TS A LITTLE BIT WITH EMAIL TODAY. I WOULD REALLY WANT TO GET A RECORD OF WHAT IS GAINED AND WHAT IS BEING GAINED AND WHAT IS BEING LOST IN OUR COMMUNITY, BOTH THE TYPES OF HOUSING, THE BEDROOMS, THE COST AND THE ACREAGE AND SO ON. EVERYTHING ABOUT IT. I THINK WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO CHART OUR PROGRESS OR LACK THEREOF, WHEN IT COMES TO THE TYPEOF HOUSING ANDHEMOUNT OF HOUSING THAT IS GOING UP AND COMING DOWN IN ANN ARBOR. I ANY THAT'S GOING TO BE CRITICAL INFORMATION MONTH OFFING FORWARD AS WE TRY AND TACKLE THESE ISSUES THAT KIND OF UNLEASHING THE DEVELOPMENT HAS HAD ON OUR COMMUNITY AND THEY HAVE BEEN -- THEY HAVE BEEN MANY NEGATIVE ISSUES HAVE COME WITH THAT. AND SO I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS, DESPITE THE TRAFFIC WOES AND I -- I PY THATOBODY GETS RAILED COMING OUT OF THIS COMMUNITY. I'M CONCERNED, BUT SUPPORTIVE. THANK YOU.
03:44:02.883: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
03:44:04.118: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES, I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FOR STAFF. PRIMARILY FOR THE PUBLIC RECORD, BECAUSE I'M SOMEWHAT CONFUSED WHY WE HAVE TO HAVE A RIGHT TURN ONLY COMING OUT OF THE PROPERTY, AND WHAT EXACTLY THE SIGHT DISTANCE IS. WE WANT TO REDUCE OUR POLICE CITIZEN INTERACTION. SO WHEN WE CREATE A BARRIER TO WHAT IS TEFAULT NORL BEHAVIOR AND WE ARE NOT LETTING PEOPLE MAKE A LEFT-HAND TURN OUT, WHEN WE KNOW THEY WANT TO GO IN THAT DIRECTION, IT TROUBLES ME THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BREAK THE LAW AND THEN WE WILL HAVE TO USE ENFORCEMENT AND I JUST DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S A GOOD OPTION. SO MY FIR TWO QUESTIONS ARE ABOUT THE TRAFFIC FLOW OUT OF THE PROPERTY, AND WHAT'S CAUSING THE SIGHT DISTANCE PROBLEM, AND COULD IT BE REMOVED?
03:45:10.517: >> GOOD EVENING, MAYOR AND COUNCILMEMBERS, I'M BRETT LENART THE PLAN MANAGER AND ALEX HE IS DILEO AND CYNTHIA REDINGER AS WELL. I WILL DO MY BEST TO ADDRESS THAT QUESTION. WE AGREE. THE CIRCULATION OF TRAFFIC IN THIS PARTICULAR CONFIGURATION FOR THIS SITE IS LESS THAN IDEAL. HOWEVER, THAT CONFIGURATION IN OUR OPINION IS NECESSITATED FOR SAFETY CONCERNS. PROVIDING SAFE ACCESS TO THIS SITE WARRANTS THAT CONFIGURATION, AND THE PETITIONER IN WORKING WITH CITY STAFF WORKED TO ORIENT THAT DRIVE AND IN RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PUBLIC ROAD RIGHT-OF-WAY IN THE BEST MEANS THAT WE CAN TO DISCOURAGEOLKS NOT FOLLOWING THE DESIGN DIRECTION THAT WE ASSERT. BY NO MEANS CAN I SIT HERE AND GARR RAN GUARANTEE THAT IT WILLR OCCUR. AND THE GRADE CHANGES OF LIBERTY AND THE PRESENCE OF OVERPASS AND THE CORRESPONDING GUARDRAILS AND WALLS --EALLY DO NECESSITY THAT OUR THE RIGHT TURN IN AND OUT IS APPROPRIATE BECAUSE IT IS -- IT -- IT'S VITAL TO THE SAFETY OF THAT FUNCTION OF ACCESS TO THAT SITE. AND I DON'T KNOW IF SIN THINK, YOU OR ALEXIS YOU WANT TO ADD ANYTHING ELSE TO THAT.
03:46:50.184: >> I CAN ADD THAT THE SIGHT DISTANCE PROBLEM IS ON THE INSIDE OF A SLIGHT CURVE ON LIBERTY. AND WHEN SEATED IN A CAR, IT IS HARD FOROTORISTS TO LOOK UP ENOUGH AND AROUND THE CURB ENOUGH AND THAT'S CREATING THE SIGHT DISTANCE PROBLEM. AND THEN COMPOUNDING ALL OF THAT IS THE FACT THAT THERE ARE THERE ARE SOLID WALLS, SOLID PARAPET WALLS TO THE BRIDGE. SO WHAT LITTLE SIGHT DISTANCE YOU HAVE, I BLOCK BY THE SOLID BRIDGE WALL. I BELIEVE YOU MENTIONED COULD IT BE REMOVED, WELL -- I MEAN, IT COULD -- IT COULD BE, BUT IT REQUIRES A FULL RECONSTRUCTION OF BOTH THE BRIDGE OVER 94 AND GREAT CHANGES FOR HUNDREDS OF YARDS. AND IS THERE ANY WAY TO ME THE DRIVEWAY FURTHER TO THE EAST?
03:48:02.256: >> THE DRIVEWAY IS AS FAR TO THE EAST AS POSSIBLE. THE DEVELOPMENT TEAM LOOKED INTO ASQUACQUIRING THE ADJACENT SITET IT'S NOT FOR SALE.
03:48:26.280: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
03:48:27.147: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I'M CONCERNED WITH SOME OF THE TRAFFICS, AND  THE AMENITIES ALL LIE TO THE EAST, THE SHOPS DOWNTOWN. THERE'S GOING TO BE A WHOLE LOT OFRAFFIC THAT WOULD GO -- WOULD GO EAST DOWN LIBERTY GET DOWN TO TOWN AND STORES AND THINGS THAT PEOPLE WOULD WANT TO GET TO. I'M WONDERING IN THE CURRENT CONFIGURATION, THE FOLKS WOULD HAVE TO CEL ET AND GO ALL THE WY DOWN TO WAGNER. 40 YOU DO THEY HEAD BACK EAST IN REAL DEHERE?
03:49:14.995: >> YOUR ASSERTIONS ARE CORRECT, THEY WOULD HAVE TO HEAD WEST AND SEEK SOME OTHER ROUTE TO THE CITY. THAT COULD BE GOING ALL THE WAY TO WAGNER OR PERHAPS THROUGH -- THERE'S ANOTHER ROAD THERE THAT CONNECTED DOWN TO SCIO CHURCH AS WELL, BUT ABSOLUTELY. AND THAT IS -- THAT IS A BALANCE THAT, YOU KNOW, WE RECOGNIZE WAS A FFICULTY IN MAKIN SURE THIS SITE COMPLIED WITH CODE, BUT IN THE END THE ADVERSE CONCERNS ABOUT THE TRAFFIC CIRCULATION WERE OUTWE OUTWEIGHED THAT THE CERTAINING DISTANCES ARE SAFE TO THE GREATEST EXTENT POSSIBLE. I'M NOT TRYING TO DIMINISH IT. THERE WILL BE VEHICULAR TRIPS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SITE BUT IT'S FORTUNATELY ALSO A TNSIT ACCESS ROUTES AND OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE IN THAT AREA SO IDEALLY SOME OF THE CHALLENGES OF THAT MAY HELP WITH THE MODE SHARE OF TRIPS FROM THAT SITE BUT YOU ARE DEFINITELY RIGHT, THIS IS CODE COMPLIANCE OVER SAFETY CIRCULATION PATTERN. I FEEL LIKE PEOPLE WILL BE DOING THINGS UP SAFE IN THEIR CARS IN ORDER TO HEAD BACK EAST AND THAT LIGHT CAUSE A BIGGER THREAT THAN WHAT WE ARE TRY TO ACHIEVE IN ADDRESSING THIS SO I JUST HAVE A QUESTION. I KNOW WE ARE RUNNING LATE. I HAVE A CONCERN THAT I HAVE ALREADY FORWARDED I THINK TO DERRICK AND THE CITY ATTORNEYS ON ANOTHER PROPERTY THAT IS NEAR THIS, WHERE IT WAS RECTLY CONSTRUCTED AND NOW THINGS ARE FALLING APART. THE CRAFTSMANSHIP AND THE WORKMANSHIP WAS POOR AND THEY ARE HAVING ALL SORTS OF ISSUE WITH THE HOME THAT THEY PURCHASED. WHAT IS THE RECOURSE FOR PEOPLE THAT MOVE INTO TSE NEW DEVELOPMENTS AND END UP BUYING BUYINGLEMONS? DOES THE CITY -- AND I GUESS I CAN TAKE THIS OFFLINE, BUT IT'S A CONCERN OF MINE. THAT SOME OF THESE NEW DEVELOPMENTS ARE NOT BUILT VERY WELL AND THEY START TO FALL APART SOON AFTER PEOPLE MOVE IN. WHAT KIND OF RESOURCE IS THERE IS ARE THERE ANY PROTECTIONS THAT WE PUT IN PLACE IN A STEP LIKE THIS?
03:52:05.899: >> IT'S NOT SOMETHING I COULD OFFER FEEDBACK ON. THAT'S SOMETHING FOR THE BUILDING DEPARTMENT PROBABLY SPECIFICALLY, OBVIOUSLY WE AS THE CITY SPECIFY AND ADOPT BUILDING CODES AND MANDATED BY THE STATE, BUT I COULDN'T RESPOND TO WITHIN THOSE CODES WHAT RECOURSE, IF ANY WOULD EXIST.
03:52:32.426: >> IF I COULD ADD, THERE IS A DIFFERENCE AS MR. LENART WAS SUGGESTING. OUR CODES REALLY AREBOUT COMPLIANCE WITH CODE. AND THERE'S VERY DISTINCT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT AND WORKMANSHIP. SO AS LONG AS THEY ARE COMPLYING WITH THE CODE, THAT'S WHAT THE CITY IS INSPECTING AND I MAKE THAT -- I MAKE THAT DIFFERENTIAL BECAUSE CONCER CERTAINLY WHEN TE BUILDING INSPECTOR GOES OUT, IT HAS TO MEET THAT REQUIREMENT BUT THEY DON'T LOOK AT WORKMANSHIP, IF THAT MAKES SENSE. THAT'S THE TERM THAT'S USED. SO THE QUALITY OF IT IS SOMEWHAT SEPARATE AND IT MEETING THE CODES ITSELF.
03:53:24.644: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
03:53:25.779: >> Councilmember Nelson: THANK YOU. I HAD A QUICK QUESTION FOR STAFF. I THOUGHT IT WAS AN INTRIGUING SOLUTION, THE -- I GUESS IT'S CALLED A MEDIAN IN THAT DRIVEWAY TO ALLOW FOR EMERGENCY VEHICLES TO MAKE THAT LEFT. TREATMENT HAS -- EXISTED OF A ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE CITY THAT YOU ARE AWARE OF.
03:53:57.444: >> GENERALLY, -- SOMETIMES THEY ARE CALLED PORK CHOPS. BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT THE SHAPE. I'M NOT AWARE OF ANOTHER ONE THAT HAS THAT LEVEL OF SPECIFIED TREATMENT FOR THE HEIGHT AND OTHER CUTS TO ALLOW MOVEMENT OF SORT OF HIGHER CLEARANCE EMERGENCY VEHICLES BUT NOT TYPICAL PASSENGER VEHICLES. I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY.
03:54:21.635: >> WE  HAVE QUITE A FEW, ARE YO? DRIVEWAYS THROUGHOUT THE SI THAT RIGHT IN AND RIGHT NOW BY DEFINE. THERE PARTICULAR DRIVEWAY DOES HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE OF AN AGGRESSIVE RIGHT OUT THAN MAYBE SOME OTHERS THAT YOU HAVE BEEN -- THAT YOU HAVE EXPERIENCED IN TOWN TO REALLY -- TO REALLY BY PHYSICAL DESIGN GE. AS FAR AS THE CUT THROUGH FOR THE FIRE TRUCK AND, YOU KNOW, ALSO OUR SOLID WASTE VEHICLES WOULD BE ABLE TO USE IT, THAT'S NOT AI DESIGN WE HAVE EMPLOYED IN THE CITY, ANYWHERE BUT IT'S STANDARD DESIGN AND IT TYPICALLY GETS USED ALONG WITH TRAFFIC CALMINELEMENTS SO THAT YOU CAN HAVE A VERTICAL DEVICE OR IN SOME PLACES YOU MIGHT SEE A DEFLECTOR WHERE YOU STILL WANT TO MAINTAIN THAT EMERGENCY VEHICLE ACCESS SO THAT THEY -- THE -- THIS DESIGN IS BASED ON THAT, SO THAT A LARGER VEHICLE CAN PASS THROUGH THERE BUT A SMALLER VEHICLE WOULD ENCNTER PROBLEMS DNG THAT AND THEREFORE NOT GO THAT WAY.
03:55:35.242: >> SO LOOKING AT THE DIAGRAMS AND MAYBE I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THEM CORRECTLY AS I WAS LOOKING AT THEM, IT LOOKED LIKE THERE ARE LITERALLY GROOVES THAT THE DRIVER OF THESE LARGER VEHICLES IS GOING TO SORT OF AIM FOR SO THAT THEIR TIRES CAN HIT THOSE IS THAT RIGHT?OVER THE MEDIAN,
03:55:55.795: >> YES, THOSE LOCATIONS NOR THE WHEEL PATH AND THAT WAS DESIGNED WITH TURNING TEMPLATES. THEY ARE AT GRADE WITH THETIVEMENT. THEY ARE DESIGNED TO LITERALLY DRIVEN OVER AND THE FIRE DEPARTMENT HAS REVIEWED THAT AS WELL.
03:56:22.889: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I DIDN'T SEE AS MUCH FEEDBACK -- I MEAN, THEY -- THEY SAID THAT THIS WAS AN OKAY SOLUTION. BUT I GUESS MY MAIN QUESTION WAS IF THIS DOESN'T EXIST THEY ARE ELSE IN THE CITY, WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS ABOUT THE DRING THESE VEHICLES, FIGURING OUT HOW TO NAVIGATE THIS. IT WOULD BE -- DO YOU FOLLOW WHAT I'M SAYING? LIKE, THE -- WAS THIS SIGNIFICANT FEEDBACK FROM THE EMERGENCY  SERVICES THAT, LIKE, THIS IS GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT.
03:56:59.292: >> CAN ADDRESSHIS SOMEWHAT. WE DID WORK WITH AND WE HAD MORE THAN ONE MEETING WITH BOTH THE OUTGOING FIRE MARSHAL, KATHLEEN SUMMER SKILL AND THE NEW FIRE MARSHAL, MICHAEL REDMAN AND BOTH WERE VERY CONFIDENT THAT THEIR DRIVERS WOULD BE ABLE TO NAVIGATE THIS -- I'MLANKG ON THE CORRECT PORK CHOP TERM, BUT --
03:57:24.517: >> I BELIEVE IT'S MEDIUM RARE. (LAUGHTER).
03:57:29.723: >> FOR THIS RARE PORK CHOP TERM. AND THEY BOTH WERE VERY CONFIDENT. THEY HAVEN'T MENTIONED THIS BUT WE HAD SITUATIONS AROUND THE CITY. WE HAVE GRASS PAPER SYSTEMS THAT CONNECT MAYBE TWO SUBTRTS THAT THE FIRE DARTMENT IS EXPECTED TO NAVIGATE, AND SO FORTH, AND SO WE HAVE SOME NON-STANDARD -- MAYBE IT'S NOT NON-STANDARD. WE HAVE SOME SITUATIONS IN THE CITY THAT ARE NOT EVERY DAY SITUATIONS, THAT THE FIRE MARSHALS WERE CONFIDENT THAT THEIR DRIVERS COULD BE ABLE TO NAVIGATE. I BELIEVE COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER TED THAT FIRE TRUCKS NOW BY DESIGN, THEY GO OVER SOME ROUND ABOUTS. SO THEY ARE -- THEY HAVE WAYS TO DEAL WITH THESE -- THESE MEDIUMS. AND THE BENEFIT OF THIS IS THAT WHERE NO FIRE TRUCK WILL BE REQUIRED TO JUMP A CURB, BUT ALSO AMBULANCES AND SOLID WASTE CAN USE THESE AS WELL WITHOUT ANY DAMAGE TO THE VEHICLE.
03:58:32.485: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I APPRECIATE THAT ANSWER. I GUESS MY ONLY COMMENT IS THAT I THINK SOMETIMES WE FORGET IN ANN ARBOR THAT AS MUCH AS WE ARE A CENTER FOR EMPLOYMENT, THERE ARE QUITE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THIS TOWN AND COMMUTE OUT. AND THE FACT THAT WE ARE ON 94 MEANS AT NOT EVERYDY WHO IS LIVING IN THE CITY, OR ON THE EDGE OF THE CITY GOING TOWARDS THE CITY. SO I WOULD BE HOPEFUL THAT SINCE THEY ARE TRYING TO WORK WITH A REALLY NARROW LOT, THEY CAN'T MAKE THAT LEFT BACK INTO DOWNTOWN, THAT SOME OF THE PEOPLE -- SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT LIVE HERE MAY VERY WELL BE TRYING TO GET TO 94 AND IT'S NOT SO WOO ORDINARY TO MAKE THAT RIGHT TURN AND SO I GUESS I'M CROSSING MY FINGERS THAT WE DON'T HAVE A WHOLE BUNCH OF PEOPLE WHO ARE AINGE EVERY ARE Y MORNING THAT THEY CAN'T MAKE THAT LEFT. THANKS.
03:59:26.906: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
03:59:27.774: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU. I GUESS THIS IS JUST CONTINUING UP WITH THE QUESTIONING. BECAUSE LIKE I SAID, I THINK IS IS I ANE A NEGLECTED SITE THE NEED. IS SO THE PARCEL TO THE IMMEDIATE EAST TO IT, IMMEDIATELY ADJACENT TO THAT, YOU HAVE THE NORFOLK HOMES AND THE HEATING AND COOLING AND ALL OF THAT, ARE -- ARE WE GOING BESIEGE THAT OWNER TO CONTINUE THE SIDELKTUFF, THAT HE' GOING TO BE THE LONE GAP IN THE SIDEWALK ON THE NORTH SIDE OF LIBERTY THERE FROM WHAT I SEE? AND THEN I GUESS MY OTHER QUESTION IS, HAVE WE -- THE PARK IS IMMEDIATELY ACROSS STREET. I TRIED TO LOOK AT THE ALIGNMENT ON THE SITE LAND PLAN, I DIDN'T HAVE A SITE PLAN LIKE I'M LOOKING AT NOW. IS THERE CONCE WITH THIS TRAFFIC SITUATION THAT EITHER SOUTH MAPLE PARK OR LIBERTY POINT DRIVE OR SUMMERFIELD GLEN CIRCLES WILL BECOME THE DE FACTO TURNAROUNDS FOR THIS. HAVE WE NOTIFIED THE PROPERTY OWNERS OF THOSE TWO SUBDIVISIONS THAT -- THERE ARE ANY -- I GUESS MY QUESTION IS, IS THERE ANY CONSIDERATION THAT WE MIGHT ANTICIPATE THAT THOSE WILL BE USED AS TURNAROUNDS AND HAVE TO MAKE NECESSARY IMPROVEMENTS TO THE TRAFFIC FLOW OR THE SIGNALING OR THE SIGNAGE OR SOMETHING IN THAT AREA? HAS THAT BEEN CONSIDERED? I JUST MISSED IT ON THE PLAN. ONE MORE THING REAL QUICK. YOU KNOW, WE APPROVED -- NOT ALL OF US, BUT WE APPROVE AN AREA PLAN FOR MISHCON WHERE IT WAS AN IMPROVED SIDEWALK TO GET ON TO THAT SITE SO I'M NOT SO WORRIED ABOUT EMERGENCY SERVICES AND THE OCCASIONAL VISIT, AS I AM THE WEEKLY FREQUENCY OF OUR TRASH AND RECYCLING PICKUPS. SO ANYWAY, I JUST -- I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THOSE TWO LOOP DELOOPS IMMEDIATELY TO THE LEFT. I THINK THEY WILL BECOME DE FACTO TURNAROUNDS UNLESS THIS IMPROVES THAT SIDE OF TOWN'S RELATIONSHIP WITH SCIO TOWNSHIP AND EVERYBODY STARTS GOING OUT THERE, WHICH WOULDN'T BE THE WORST THING BECAUSE OUR HOUSING WOES ARE -- THEY ARE REGIONAL. THANK YOU. ISWOLDor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER
04:01:42.809: >> Cncilmember Gswold:  I WANT TO ACKWLEDGE THAT CYNTHIA HAS BEEN WITH US ALL EVENING, AND I ALWAYS APPRECIATE WHEN WE HAVE A PROFESSIONAL ENGINEER. I DO HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION. IS THERE ANY CRASH DATA REGARDING THIS TYPE OF DESIGN AND I KNOW AT HURON HIGH SCHOOL ON FULLER, IF YOU ARE COMING FROM THE WEST AND GOING INTO ATHLETIC FIELD AREA, IT'S A NO LEFT TURN AND IT'S THE SAME REASON, IT'S A SIGHT DISTANCE PROBLEM DUE TO ELEVATION. SO WHAT PEOPLE DO, THEY DRIVE RIGHT BEYOND THE ENTRANCE AND THEN THEY MAKE A LITTLE DOUGHNUT IN PART OF THE ATHLETIC FIELD WHICH HAS BECOME A LITE ROUNDABOUT THEREECAUSE IT'S USED SO MUCH AND THEN GO INTO THE SCHOOL. AND I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY CRASHES AT THAT LOCATION, BUT I'M JUST WONDERING IF WE'RE INCREASING OUR CRASH RATE WITH THIS TYPE OF UNUSUAL DESIGN. OH, ANOTHER THING, PICKUP TRUCKS. COULD THEY GO THROUGH THIS? OR DO THEY HAVE A NARROWER WHEEL BASE THAN SAY AN EMS VEHICLE?
04:02:55.248: >> I WILL ANSWER THE LAST QUESTION FIRST. AND THAT IS PICKUP TRUCKS GENERALLY HAVE THE SAME WHEEL BASE AS ANOTHER TYPE OF PASSENGER, PERSONAL VEHICLE. SO YOUR IRRE FIRE TRUCK OR EMS RESPONSE VEHICLE, THEY WILL HAVE A WIDER WHEEL BASE.
04:03:13.833: >> Councilmember Griswold: OKAY. GOOD.
04:03:15.034: >> I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THE DRIVEWAY DOESN'T HAVE RESTRICTION IN. IT IS A FULL ACCESS IN AND RIGHT TURN OUT ONLY. THE TURN RESTRICTION IS VERY SPECIFIC TO THE SITE OBSTRUCTION, AND THAT IS -- THERESN ENOUGH DECISION SIGHT DECISION FOR A MOTORIST EXITING SITE, BUT THE SIGHT DISTANCE ALONG LIBERTY IS SUFFICIENT TO MAKE TURNS INTO THE SITE, SO THERE ARE NO SITE RESTRICTIONS FOR THE VEHICLE TURNING INTO THE SITE AND THERE'S NO TURN RESTRICTIONS FOR VEHICLES.
04:03:50.169: >> Councilmember Griswold: THANKS. DI'TIT FM AN ENGINEERING REALLY STANDPOINT. THANKS FOR POINTING THAT OUT.
04:03:58.845: >> BUT, STILL, THE REASON THAT WE ENCOURAGED THE APPLICANT TO PURSUE A DIFFERENT TYPE OF DESIGN WAS THAT WE DON'T WANT TO CREATE A SCENARIO WHERE THAT DECISION TO SITE DISTANCE IS NOT THERE, WHICH COULD LEAD TO CRASHES.
04:04:18.831: >> Councilmember Griswold: THANKS.
04:04:20.566: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER SMITH.
04:04:22.168: >> Councilmember Smith: YEAH. MS. REDINGER, ONE SIMPLE QUESTION IS I'M ASSUMING THAT WE AREN'T TALKING ABOUT A TRAFFIC SIGNAL HERE, BECAUSE IT DOESN'T MEET THE PAREN WARRANTS FOR THE INSTALTIONF A TFF SIGNAL?
04:04:38.584: >> THAT'S CORRECT. IN THE AMP, THEY HAVE SEVEN VEHICLES -- SEVEN TRIPS EXITING -- THAT'S THE PMP, 13 VEHICLES IN THE A A.M. PEAK TRIPS EXITING SEVEN EXITING IN THE P.M. PEAK. SO YOU REALLY -- YOU ARE NOT GETTING ANYWHERE NEAR TRAFFIC SIGNAL WARRANTS.
04:05:03.709: >> Councilmember Smith: THANK YOU. I'M DONE.
04:05:11.584: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE, STARTING WITH ME.
04:05:28.301: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
04:05:28.801: >> Councilmember Eaton: YES.

04:05:58.197: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. DO WE HAVE ANY COMMUNICATIONS FROM OUR CITY ATTORNEY?
04:06:04.003: >> DO NOT MAYOR THANK YOU.
04:06:05.738: >> Mayor Taylor: WE HAVE BEFORE US THE CLERK'S REPORT OF COMMUNICATIONS, PETITIONS AND REFERRALS. MOVED BY COUNCIL MEMBER LUMM, SECONDED BY SMITH. DISCUSSION OF THE CLERK'S REPORT. ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] ALL OPPOSED? THE CLERK'S REPORT IS APPROVED. WE NOW COME TO PUBLIC COMMENT GENERAL TIME. PUBLIC COMMENT GENERAL TIME IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO SAK TO COUNC AND THE COMMUNITY ABOUT MATTERS OF MUNICIPAL INTEREST. TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT GENERAL TIME, ONE NEED NOT HAVE SIGNED UP IN ADVANCE. TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT GENERAL TIME, PLEASE DIAL THE KNUBLE ON YOUR SCREEN, 877- 877-853-5247. ENTER MEETI CODE 96867158896. THAT IS 96867158896. AFTER YOU HAVE DIALED THE MEETING ID, AND JOINED US, PLEASE ENTER STAR NINE. YO HAND S THAT YOU WILL B--AISE TO BE CALLED ON.

04:07:36.896: >> Clerk Beaudry: WE HAVE CALLER ENDING IN NUMBER 684.
04:07:41.400: >> YES, HI. THIS IS ERIC STURGIS CALLING IN. I WANTED TO THANK COUNCIL SMITH AND GRAND FOR BRINGING UP THE RANK CHOICE VOTING. I THINK IT IS A GREAT IDEA AND I THINK ONE GREATXAMPLES THIS NOVEMBER, IN THE SCHOOL BOARD ELECTION, THERE ARE 11 CANDIDATES RUNNING AND I DOUBT ANYONE IS GOING TO GET ANYWHERE NEAR 50%. BUT I THINK THE KEY THING HERE IS IN NOVEMBER. AND I THINK THAT'S THE KEY AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE AFTER MONDAY IF THEY BROUGHT BACK UP TO HAVE RA CHOICE VOTINGUT HE IT DONE IN NOVEMBER AT A NONPARTISAN ELECTION. THE CITY CHARTER DOES NOT SAY ANYWHERE THAT IF IT'S NONPARTISAN ELECTION, YOU HAVE TO GET A PRIMARY. SO YOU COULD RUN IT JUST LIKE THE SCHOOL BOARD AND HAVE RANK CHOICE VOTING AND YOU WOULD GET THE GREATEST TURNOUT. IN 2016, THE SCHOOL BOARD CANDIDATE ULD WONAD ROUGHLY 21,000 VOTES. NOT 5,000 TOTAL VOTES AS WE HAD IN THE FIRST WARD CITY COUNCIL RACE THIS YEAR. 21,000 VOTES IS A MUCH BETTER REPRESENTATION OF ANN ARBOR. SO I THINK THAT THE RANK CHOICE VOTING IS A GOOD THING AND LET AS BRING IT UP AFTER WASS T NONPARTISAN ELECTION. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE ARE CONSISTENT AND -- AND NASH VOTERS ARE SMART. PUT IT ON THE BALLOT AND RUN A CAMPAIGN IF YOU ARE AGAINST IT. RUN A CAMPAIGN AGAINST NONPARTISAN ELECTIONS BUT ALLOW THE VOTERS TO HAVE A CHOICE. DON'T SIT THERE AND TELL ANN ARBOR VOTERS WHAT IS BEST FOR THEM. I SUPPORT RANK CHOICE VOTING AND NONPARTISAN VOTING. LASTLY, I WANT TO WISH COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN AN EARLY HAPPY BIRTHDAY. THANK YOU AND GOOD NIGHT.
04:09:33.679: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. WE HAVE TWO CALLERS REMAINING 439 AND 829, IF EITHER OF YOU WISH TO SPEAK, PLEASE PRESS STAR NINE NOW. CLERK CALLER 439.
04:09:57.036: >> I HAD THERE. HOW LONG DO I HAVE TO SPEAK?
04:09:59.672: >> Mayor Taylor: THREE MINUTES.
04:10:01.006: >> GREAT. FANTASTIC. SO THIS IS HENRY McCONNELL. I SPOKE EARLIER TONHT ABOUT THE URGENT NEED FOR A DOWNTOWN MASK ORDER. JUST TO RECAP MY COMMENTS FOR ANY WHO WERE NOT IN ATTENDANCE OR JUST TUNING IN NOW. I'M AN ANN ARBOR NATIVE AND I SAW FIRSTHAND WHAT COVID DID TO NEW YORK CITY WHERE I HAD BEEN LIVING THE LAST FIVE YEARS. IT WAS LIKE 9/11 IN SLOW MOTION BUT IAW HOW NEW YORK USED AN IMPRESSIVE MASKING APPROACH TO CLIMB OUT OF THAT AND TO MAINTAIN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND TO MAINTAIN PUBLIC HEALTH FOR ITS CITIZENS. SO WHAT I'M CALLING ON COUNCIL TO DO IS TO ESTABLISH AN ORDER FOR DOWNTOWN MASKING IN ORDER WITH GOVERNOR WHITMER'S STATEWIDE ORDER. FOR MES A DNTOWN RESIDENT, CITIZENS ARE NOT FOLLOWING HER ORDER. THERE IS SIMPLY TOO MUCH INEVITABLE PASSING, CONGESTION. IT'S NOT INTENTIONAL. I KNOW PEOPLE MEAN WELL, BUT THEY ARE NOT MASKED AND IT IS A DANGER TO OUR COMMUNITY AND OUR PUBLIC HEALTH, ESPECIALLY AS WE ARE ON THE VERGE OF TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CITIZENSEENTERING OUR COMMUNITY AS UNIVERSITY MICHIGAN STUDENTS DO. I BELIEVE THERE'S A SIMPLE PATH FORWARD HERE. I'M CALLING ON ALL OF YOU COUNCILMEMBERS TO TAKE AND PEACEFULLY ENFORCE A DOWNTOWN MASKING ORDER MUCH LIKE OUR RIVALS AT EAST LANSING AND MICHIGAN HAVE DONE. THEY HAVE INSTITUTED A DOWNTOWN MAING ORDER AND THIS IS VERY ESSENTIAL SO THAT WE CAN CONTROL THE VIRUS RATHER THAN LET THE VIRUS CONTROL US. IT'S REALLY VERY SIMPLE, I THINK AND MASKING IS EXTREME LeEFFECTIVE. SCIENCE -- EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE. SCIENTISTS HAVE FOUND THAT 70 TO 80% MASK USAGE IS EQUIVALENT TO THIS IS GAT FOR BUSINESSES. IT'S GREAT FOR PUBLIC HEALTH BECAUSE IT MEANS WE DON'T HAVE TO GO BACKWARDS AND THAT'S REALLY THE CRUX OF WHAT I'M SAYING AND WHAT I HOPE TO SEE IN MY COMMUNITY BECAUSE FRANKLY, I DO NOT FEEL SAFE IN DOWNTOWN ANN ARBOR WITH THE AMOUNT OF FOLKS THAT ARE NOT WEARING MASKS AND ENDING UP CONGESTED. IT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE FOR' COMMUNITY LIKE OURS THAT IS SO GROUNDED IN SCIENCE AND TRU LIKE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN TEACHES ALL OF US. I THINK WE NEED TO GET VERY SERIOUS ABOUT THIS BEFORE THE STUDENTS COME BACK AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING WHAT ACTS YOU ALL TAKE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
04:12:28.287: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. ARE THERE SPEAKERS WHO ARE HERE. IF ANYONE WISHES TO SPEAK, PLEASE ENT STAR NINE NOW.
04:12:44.570: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER PHONE NUMBER ENDING IN 205.
04:12:50.042: >> HEY. IT'S JOE SPALDING OVER HERE IN CALIFORNIA. IT'S BEEN A FUN WEEK. I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT RANK CHOICE VOTING FOR A MINUTE HERE. THE FIRST THING TT I WANT TO SAY IS THAT WHEN YOU START TALKING ABOUT ANN ARBOR ISN'T FOLLOWING THE REST OF THE STATE, THAT'S A BADGE OF HONOR. YOU SHOULD WEAR IT AS A BADGE OF HONOR AND FRANKLY, IT'S NOT MY -- JUST MY OPINION, BUT ANN ARBOR SHOULD BE LEADING THE WAY WHEN IT COMES TO POLICY SPECIFICALLY PROGRESSIVE POLICY AND I -- I DON'T WANT TO OVEROVERGLOAT HERE BUT THE VOTES CLEARLY THINK THAT. AND WHEN IT COMES TO, YOU KNOW, SAYING THESE TWO CITIES ARE THE ONLY OTHER CITIES THAT HAVE, YOU KNOW, PARTISAN ELECTIONS, LIKE WHAT I HEAR WHEN I HEAR THAT IS THAT ANN ARBOR NEEDS TO BE MORE LIKE KALKASKA AND MORE LIKE HOWELL AND JACKSON AND ANN ARBOR NEEDS TO B MOR LIKE GRANDVILLE AND HUDSONVILLEND I JUST THINK THAT THAT'S FOOLISH. I'M NOT SPEAKING AS SOME RANDOM PERSON ON THE STREET HERE. I RAN STRATEGY AND MESSAGING FOR VOTERS, NOT POLITICIANS, FOR THEIR PETITION WHEN SCUBIC AND ALL THE REST WERE ON THEHOW GRILLI KATIE ABOUT THE POLICY BEING TOO COMPLEX. YOU KNOW, I WAS MAKING SURE SHE HAD THE RIGHT LANGUAGE FOR SAYING, NO, IT'S ACTUALLY SIMPLE, BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT PUTTING THIS TO A VOTE FOR THE VOTERS, YOU ARE ASKING A VERY HIGH LIFT AND I DON'T HEAR A LOT OF VOICES ON COUNCIL TO THOSE WHO ARE EDIT CARESSING. AND I DON'T HEAR A LOT OF VOICES ON COUNCIL THAT REALLY UNDERSTAND RANK CHOICE VOTING. IN FACT, BRINGING UP PARTISAN VERSUS NONPARTISAN TO ANYBODY THAT DOES HAVE A FIRM UNDERSTANDING OF THE POLITICAL SCIENCE AND THE MESSAGING BEHIND THIS, IT JUST SOUNDS LIKE COMPLAINING. IT SOUND SOUNDS LIKE COMPLAININT NOT RUNNING QUALI ELECTIONS OR CAMPAIGNS. I'M SORRY ABOUT THE OUTCOME FOR THE PEOPLE THAT DIDN'T WIN. IT'S NOT BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE GAME WAS SET UP. THE VOTERS SPOKE AND THAT'S JUST HOW IT IS. THANKS.
04:15:04.676: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK ON QUEUE, PLEASE ENTER STAR NINE.
04:15:25.397: >> Clerk Beaudry: MAYOR CALLER 205 JUST SPOKE. DO YOU WANT MEL TO CALL ON THE LAST CALLER?
04:15:31.870: >> Mayor Taylor: I GUESS I YOU WOULD, PLEASE.
04:15:39.845: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER 882, DID YOU WANT TO MAKE A COMMENT? [ TELEVISION SOUNDS ]
04:15:53.592: >> Mayor Taylor: I ANYONE WIES TO SPEAK DIRECTLY, PLEASE ENTER STAR NINE NOW. SEEING NO ONE, PUBLIC COMMENT IS CLOSED. IS THERE COMMUNICATION FROM COUNCIL? COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
04:16:12.411: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I WOULD LIKE TO NOTE, RESPO -- I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T TAKE THE BAIT BUT I AM, TO JOE SPALDING FROM OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA, WHO HAS NOW ON CONSECUTIVE COUNCIL MEETINGS CHOSEN TO CALL IN DURING PUBLIC COMMENT, AND OPINE ABOUT THINGS HERE IN ANN ARBOR. I WOUL NOT SINCE HE IS FROM CALIFORNIA, THAT CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN IN 2016 VETOED A BILL TO EXPAND RANK CHOICE VOTING IN HIS STATE AND HE SAID IT WAS OVERLY COMPLICATED AND CONFUSING, END QUOTE, AND DEPRIVED VOTERS OF GENUINELY INFORMED CHOICE. AND I LL JUST MAKE THAT COMMENT. THANK YOU.
04:17:05.230: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
04:17:07.866: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANKS MR. MAYOR. THIS IS OFF THE -- OFF THE TOPICS A LITTLE BIT, BUT I WANT TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO CHECK OUT A MOVEMENT THAT'S UNDERWAY THAT SENATOR CLOBAUCHAR AND OTHERS, IT'S SAVE OUR STAGES, SAVE OUR STAGES.COM AND, YOU KNOW, ANN ARBOR HAS MANY, MANY INDEPENDENT VENUES. THE UNIVERSITY VENUES, THREE TH. WE HAVE BASICAL L A NICE DE FACTO THEATER- THEATER DISTRICT THAT RUPPS FROM POWER CENTER ALL THE WAY DOWN TO MAIN STREET AND THESE PLACES ARE HURTING BY STATE COMMAND. AND SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO SAVE OUR STAGES AND TAKE A MINUTE AND FILL OUT THE -- FILL OUT THE PLEA THAT'S GETTING SENT TO -- TO -- ENACT THIS BILL THAT WILL HELP THESE VENUES OUT. IT'S -- I THINK OUR -- THE ARTS AND THE PERFORMING ARTS ARE MAYBE GETTING HIL HIT THE HARDET DURING THIS RIGHT NOW. THERE'S NO WAY TO GET PEOPLE INTO A ROOM TOGETHER TO ENJOY THEATER AND IT'S -- IT'S KILLING ARTS. IT'S KILLING THE ARTS IN ANN ARBOR AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY. I WANT TO P A SHO OUT THERE FOR THE NATIONAL INDEPENDENT VENUE ASSOCIATION AND THEIR SAVE OUR STAGES BILL THEY ARE TRYING TO GET PASSED. I ALSO -- YOU KNOW, I'M -- AS I MENTIONED BEFORE, I'M A BIG FAN OF MASKS. AND I HAVE HAD FOLKS WRITE ME AND LIKE -- LIKE THE CALLER SAID AND SAY, PLEASE IS THERE SOMETHG THAT WE N DOO ENFORCE IT, IT'S GOING TOEN EVEN TO BEEVEN MORE CRITICAL. AND I HAD PEOPLE ASK ME ABOUT THE 40 HOUSE PARTIES NOW THAT TE BARS ARE CLOSED. SOME STATES AND MUNICIPALITIES HAVE REALLY RAMPED IT UP. THERE'S TALK OF TURNING OFF WATER AND ELECTRIC TO THESE HOES A SFF, AND I DON'T SUPPORT THAT NOTION, BUT I SAW THAT ONLINE AND PEOPLE ASKED ME ABOUT IT, AND SO I WOULD LIKE TO -- I GUESS I WOULD LIKE TO CALL ON OUR ADMINISTRATION AND ANY COUNCIL COLLEAGUES WHO FEEL LIKE THEY WOULD HAVE SOME INSIGHT ON TO WHAT WE CAN DO AROUND THIS ISSUE. WHAT WE CAN DO TO MAKE THE PUBLIC HEALTH IMPROVEMENTS NECESSARY IN OUR COMMUNITY. I THINK  CAN -- I WEAR MASKS ALL THE TIME FOR WORK. IT DOESN'T BOTHER ME. I KIND OF LIKE IT. I CAN'T GET MY N-95s ANY MORE FOR WORK. I HAVE BEEN SAVING AND REUSING MY N-95 MASKS, WHICH IS NOT GREAT. IF ANYBODY WOULD LIKE TO ENCOURAGE ENFORCEMENT OR BETTER BEHAVIORS, I WOULD APPRECIATE THE INSIGHT FROM PUBLIC HEALTH PERSPECTIVE. THANK YOU.
04:20:06.878: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
04:20:07.979: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WANT TO ENTHUSIASTICALLY SUPPORT WHAT COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER SAID, WHEN I FIRST READ ABOUT HOW THEY WERE TURNING OFF THE POW AND WATER TO PARTY HOUSES, I THOUGHT, WELL, THAT'S TOTALLY CRAZY, BUT WE HAVE A SERIOUS THREAT IN THIS COMMUNITY AND SO WE NEED TO WORK WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE NOT REPEATING THE SAME THING THAT'S GOING ON IN LOS ANGELES. I ALSO WAN TO THANK JOE SPALDING FOR CALLING IN BECAUSE HE PROVED MY POINT. HE IS A POLICY WONK. THERE'S A LOT OF IDEOLOGY REGARDING RANK CHOICE VOTING. I'M NOT GOING TO ARGUE ABOUT THAT, BUT I'M AN MBA WITH MANY SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION AND THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN IMPLEMENTATION AND  IDEOLOGY. IT'S A LESSON WE ALL NEED TO REFINE AND BE AWARE OF WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A NEW SYSTEM. THANK YOU.
04:21:18.483: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER COMMUNICATN? YOU KNOW, APROPOS OF THE, YOU KNOW, COMMENTS THAT WERE JUST MADE WITH RESPECT TO THE COORDINATION BETWEEN PUBLIC HEALTH, UNIVERSITY AND CITY, YOU KNOW, FOLKS SHOULD KNOW THAT THERE HAVE BEEN, YOU KNOW, A FAIR BIT OF -- A FAIR BIT OF MEETINGS. I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN SOME O THEM. STAFF, OF COURSE, IN MANY MORE. THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE, WHICH SHH, BEING, INTERESTED IN PUBLIC HEALTH HERE IN ANN ARBOR AND THROUGHOUT THE CITY -- PARDON ME, THROUGHOUT THE STATE, HAS BEEN COORDINATING CONVERSATIONS IN JURISDICTIONS THROUGHOUT MICHIGAN. HERE IN ANN ARBOR, WE ARE COMMUNICATING AND COORDINATING WITH PUBLIC HEALTH WITH UNIVERSITY PARTNERS TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE THE RULES THAT ARE RIGHT FOR OUR COMMUNITY, WHETHER OR NOT THOSE DIVERGE OR STRONGER THAN WHAT MIGHT BE OKAY PER THE GOVERNOR'S ORDER ELSEWHERE. ALSO, UNIVERSITY IN PARTICULAR, AND PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE CITY D E SUPRT A WORKING ON COMMUNICATION STRATEGIES TO STUDENT, WHETHER THEY ARE ON CAMPUS OR OFF CAMPUS. IT'S ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL THAT WE VIEW ENFORCEMENT NOT JUST AS SOMEBODY SHOWING UP AT A PARTY, BUT AT THAT POINT, THINGS HAVE GONE BAD AND IT'S REALLY ABOUT COLIANCEND ENGAGEMENT. IT INVOLVED CONTACT AND EDUCATION FOR STUDENTS AS THEY SHOW UP, AS THEY GO ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS, YOU KNOW, WHETHER THEY ARE LIVING IN A HIGH RAISE, WHETHER -- HIGH RISE, WHETHER THEY ARE LIVING IN A -- A SIX-BEDROOM HOUSE SOMEWHERE, WHETHER THEY ARE LIVING IN A DORM, IT'S -- IS A BAD BASED COMMUNICATION CAMPAIGN THAT THE UNIVERSITY IS WORKING ON WITH RESPECT TO THEIR STUDENTS. WE ARE ENGAGED WITH IT AND IT'S BEING -- AND I THINK WHEN IT'S MORE FINALLY FLESHED OUT, THERE WILL BE A HIGH LEVEL OF UTILITY TO HAVE THAT REPORTED TO COUNCIL. MR. CRAWFORD, I THINK -- WHAT YOU HAVE HEARD ISHAT FOLKS WOULD BNTERESTED WH WE GET IT IN LINE. PLEASE -- PLEASE LET EVERYONE KNOW.
04:23:39.691: >> City Admin. Crawford: YES, AND I COULD JUST ADD, MAYOR, THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSIONS GOING ON. THIS IS MUCH MORE NUANCED AND THERE ARE LAYERS OF STRATEGIES MUCH MORE DETAILED THAN KIND OF A BROAD APPROACH TO HEY, LET AS WEAR MASKS. IT'S MUCH MORE TARGETED AND COMPLEX.
04:24:08.620: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
04:24:09.487: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  OH, YEAH. I MEAN, YOU KNOW, I DON'T HAVE A WHOLE LOT TO SAY. I APPRECIATE MR. CRAWFORD'S COMMTS THERE, BUT,OU KNOW, TALKING ABOUT LAW
