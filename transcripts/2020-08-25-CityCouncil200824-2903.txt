00:02:18.766: >> CITY CLERK:  WE HAVE A QUORUM.
00:02:19.900: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  DO WE HAVE COMMUNICATIONS TODAY FROM OUR CITY ADMINISTRATOR?
00:02:22.303: >> NO, MAYOR.
00:02:25.739: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU. WE HAVE BEFORE US THE AGENDA. MAY I HAVE A MOTION PLEASE TO APPROVE THE AGENDA? MOTION BY COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD. DISCUSSION OF THE AGENDA? ALL IN FAVOR?
00:02:39.320: >> AYE.
00:02:39.887: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  ALL OPPOSED? THE AGENDA IS APPROVED. DC1, CONSENTING TO THE MAYOR'S DECLARATION OF A LOCAL STATE OF EMERGENCY IN RESPONSE TO COVID-19, MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER GRAND. DISCUSSION OF DC1? I WOULD LIKE TO TOUCH UPON THIS BRIEFLY. AS FOLKS KNOW, AT THE OUTSET OF THE COVID-19 CRISIS, WE DECLARED -- THERE WAS DECLARED AND RATIFIED A STATE OF EMERGENCY HERE IN ANN ARBOR IN ORR TO GIV THE CITY AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE ACTION WITH RESPECT TO THE RIGHT-OF-WAY AND OTHER, YOU KNOW, LOCALLY PARTICULAR ACTIONS. THE NEED FOR A STATE OF EMERGENCY, IT TURNED OUT, WAS AT THAT TIME LARGELY OBVIATED BY THE ACTION TAKEN BY OUR GOVERNOR AND THE FEDERAL ACTION TAKEN BY THE PRESIDENT. ABOUT A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO, IN REGNITION OF TSE T ACTIONS AND THE -- YOU KNOW, WE RESCINDED THE LOCAL STATE OF EMERGENCY. WE DID SO NOT BECAUSE THE CRISIS HAD PASSED BUT BECAUSE THE UTILITY OF THE DECLARATION APPEARED NO LONGER TO BE, YOU KNOW, THAT THE DECLARATION NO LONGER APPEARED TO BE USEFUL. HOWEVER, YOU KNOW, I BELIEVE, AND I HOPE COUNCIL WILL CONCUR, AT SUC A DECLARAON DOES INDEED HAVE UTILITY BECAUSE IT DOES GIVE US THE OPPORTUNITY TO PASS ON AN EMERGENCY AND SWIFT BASIS ORDINANCES, SUCH AS -- AND RESOLUTIONS SUCH AS DC2. GIVING ORDINANCES OF IMMEDIATE EFFECT IS ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF HAVING AN EMERGENCY DECLARATION, SO I BELIEVE IT IS ACTIVE AND VITAL. I GUESS THE SUBSTANCE A THE WOULD BE A SUBJECT OF DC2, BUT THIS IS A NECESSARY CONDITION TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT PARTICULAR ORDINANCE. FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR?
00:04:35.536: >> AYE. AY
00:04:38.739: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. DC2, AN ORDINANCE TO ADD A TEMPORARY ORDINANCE, FACE COVERINGS, TWO TITLE ONE -- MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI. DISCUSSION, PLEASE, OF DC2. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM? COUILMEMBER LM:  THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. BEFORE I COMMENT, I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE AN AMENDMENT. MR. GERHART, IF YOU COULD SEND THAT OUT TO COUNCIL PLEASE, IT IS CONSISTENT WITH GOVERNOR WHITMER'S ORDER, A THIS SECTION  WOULD ADD AN EXCEPTION ON LIMITS ON GATHERING TO INCLUDE SCHOOLS, CHILDCARE ORGANIZATIONS AND COMMUNITY CENTERS. AGAIN, THAT WOULD MAKE THIS CONSISTENT WITH THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER.
00:05:30.424: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  IS THERE A SECOND? SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI. IS IT FRIENDLY TO THE BODY? IT'S FRIENDLY TO THE BODY. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, YOU STILL HAVE THE FLOOR.
00:05:37.764: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  OKAY, THANK YOU. ALSO A THANK Y TO COUNCILMEMBER MLAWI AND TO CITY ATTORNEY LARCOM IN THE ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. WE HAVE GONE BACK AND FORTH ON THIS ONE A FEW TIMES, AND I'M PLEASED TO SEE THAT WE SEEM TO HAVE REACHED A POINT WHERE WE CAN ACT. WHAT THIS DOES IS TO ADOPT A TEMPORARY EMERGENCY ORDINANCE IN ANN ARBOR RELAT TO FACMASKS ANTHPERMISSIBLE SIZE OF INDOOR AND OUTDOOR GATHERINGS. THE ORDINANCE MIRRORS EXECUTIVE WHITMER'S ORDER ON FACE COVERINGS AND MIRRORS THE WASHTENAW COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH ORDER LIMITING OUTDOOR GATHERINGS TO 25 AND LIMITING INDOOR GATHERINGS TO TEN. ALTHOUGH THE GOVERN'S ECUTIVE ORDEAN THE COUNTY'S PUBLIC HLTH ORDER ARE STILL IN EFFECT, WE FELT IT IMPORTANT TO CLARIFY EXACTLY WHAT THE RULES ARE IN ANN ARBOR. AS THE CO-OWNER OF A LOCAL PROPERTY MANAGEMENT COMPANY, WHO ALSO HAPPENS TO BE THE LEGISLATIVE CHAIR OF THE WASHTENAW AREA APARTMENT OWNER'S ASSOCIATION, MR. CHRIS EATON INDICATED TO US IN AN EMAIL, QUOTE, PEOPLE MUST NOT BE WAERINAROUND THE CITY, WONDERING WHAT RULES WOULD APPLY, A I WOULD NOTE THAT THEY HOUSE HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN STUDENTS. I BELIEVE THAT HE IS RIGHT AND THAT THIS ORDINANCE PROPOSAL IS ALL ABOUT PROVIDING THAT CLARITY. IT'S NOT A NEW SET OF RULES. IT'S MAKING SURE THAT EVERYONE IN ANN ARBOR, INCLUDING THE THOUSANDS OF U OF M STUDENTS GLOBE, IS AWARE  THE CITY'S REQUIREMENTS A EXPECTATIONS. AND AS THE UNIVERSITY INDICATED IN THEIR PRESENTATION ON THEIR PLANS AND PROPOSAL TO EDUCATE THEIR STUDENTS AND THEIR RULES FOR CONDUCT ON CAMPUS, IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE UNIVERSITY AND CITY APPROACH THIS AS A LLABORATIVE EFRT WHOINT ACCOUNTABILITY, AND I BELIEVE ADOPTING THIS ORDINANCE HELPS FACILITATE THAT. VIOLATION OF THE ORDINANCE IS A CIVIL INFRACTION, WITH A FINE FROM $100 TO $250. IF ADOPTED, THE TEMPORARY ORDINANCE WOULD EXPIRE WHEN THE GOVERNOR'S STATE OF EMERGENCY IS TERMINATED. THANKS AGAIN TO CITY ATTORNEY LARCOM FOR HER ASSISTANCE IN PULLING THIS TOGETHER AND WE HOPE THAT COUNCIL WILL AGREE THAT PROVIDING CRITY IS IMPORTANT AND WILL JOIN US IN SUPPORTING THIS TONIGHT. I ALSO APPRECIATE COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI'S AND THE MAYOR'S CO-SPONSORSHIP AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.
00:08:09.316: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
00:08:10.217: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I JUST HAD A QUESTION ABOUT THE EXPITION OFECTION 10 -- WELL, I HAD TWO QUESTIS. SECTION I EXEMPTS A FACE MASK AT A POLLING PLACE, AND I ASSUME THAT'S TO BE IN LINE WITH THE STATE MANDATE ON THAT? IS THERE A SPECIAL REASON THAT WE EXEMPT FOR POLLING PLACES IN THAT LIST OF EXEMPTED PLACES? I JUST WOULD PUT THAT OUT THERE FOR ANYBODY TO ANSWER.
00:08:34.107: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  I CAN THANKS. ILMBER HNER:  AH,
00:08:39.980: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  THAT'S THE STEP -- SORRY, THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE GOVERNOR'S ORDER ON [ OFF MIC ] AND FACE MASKS, YES.
00:08:49.289: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  SO WHEN YOU GO TO SECTION 10, THE EXPIRATION OF THE ORDINANCE, IT SAYS IT EXPIRES WHEN THE GOVERNOR'S DECLARATION DECLARES THAT THAT HAS BEEN TERMINATED, AND SO THAT'S OURUNSET ON THIS, IS WHEN THE GERNOR SAYS IT'S NO LONGER NECESSARY? BUT GIVEN, MR. MAYOR, HAVING YOU HAVE THE EMERGENCY POWERS WITH SOME OF THAT SECTION THREE, IT COMES INTO EFFECT IMMEDIATELY UPON THE PASSING OF THIS RESOLUTION, CORRECT? BUT IT EXPIRES ON THE GOVERNOR'S WORD. AM I READING THAT CORRECTLY?
00:09:17.584: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  I BELIEVE THAT'S TRUE, BUT IL DEFER TO COUNCIL.
00:09:21.855: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  YES, THAT IS OUR INTENTION HERE JEFF -- COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, THAT WE NEEDED A DECLARATION ISSUED BY THE MAYOR TODAY SO THAT THIS COULD TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY, BUT WE WERE TRYING TO MIRROR THE STATE'S EXECUTIVE ORDER AND THE COUNTY'S ORDER AS WELL, AND THEN, AGAIN, I PLNING IT ALL, BUT I'LL HAVEM SOME MORE TO SAY LATER.
00:09:45.612: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  I GUESS MY QUESTION ABOUT THAT ITEM WOULD BE THEN, FINALLY, IS -- IS -- ARE -- MR. MAYOR, WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO, IF WE FELT -- IF THE GOVERNOR SAID, HEY, THERE'S NOT A STATE OF EMERGENCY, BUT WE SEE LOCAL CONDITIONS AND WOULD PREFER TO KEEP THISRD I EFFECT, IS THAT POSSIBLE THE WAY THIIS WRITTEN NOW?
00:10:08.268: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  I WOULD AGAIN DEFER TO COUNCIL.
00:10:10.337: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  IT SEEMS LIKE NOT LIKELY, AND I WONDER IF WE WOULD BE IN A BETTER POSITION TO ACT LOCALLY, THAT WE COULD SAY, WELL, THE GOVERNOR FEELS THERE IS NO STATE OF EMERGENCY, BUT WE FEEL IT IS NECESSARY. MAYOR TLOR: R.POSTA ANR. LARKHAM, THIS IS A QUESTION AS TO THE AUTHORITY OF THE OFFICE.
00:10:36.229: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  I APPRECIATE IT, BECAUSE I KNOW THIS KIND OF CAME FAST, SO WE DIDN'T HAVE THE NORMAL ROUND OF QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS. THANK YOU.
00:10:48.809: >> HI, YES. I BELIEVE THAT THE MAYOR'S -- THE MAYOR'S DECLARATION IS DEPENDENT ON THERE BEING A GOVERNOR'S DECLARATION, AND ONCE THE GOVERNOR'S DECLARATION EXPIRES, I DON'T BELIEVE TT WE CAN HAVE THIS ANYMORE.
00:11:19.306: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER: THERE'S NO AUTHORITY FOR US TO DECLARE OR -- YOU KNOW, THROUGH MR. MAYOR, TO DECLARE A LOCAL STATE OF EMERGENCY OUTSIDE OF THE STATE, IS WHAT YOU'RE SAYI?
00:11:32.919: >> KRISTEN LARCOM:  AT THIS POINT, I DON'T HAVE THAT IN FRONT OF ME. THAT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING.
00:11:38.325: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  OKAY.
00:11:41.995: >> KRISTEN LARCOM:  SO, AT THIS POINT, ALL OF THE GOVERNOR'S EMERGENCY ORDERS ARE LINKED TO HER DECLARATIONF A STATE OF EMERGENC I BELIEVE THAT THAT MES THAT THIS WOULD HAVE TO EXPIRE THEN.
00:11:59.179: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  OKAY.
00:12:02.449: >> KRISTEN LARCOM:  I WILL LOOK AT THAT SOME MORE.
00:12:12.659: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYR:  I CERTNLY NOT OPPOS TO YOU HAVI THE AUTHORITY, MR. MAYOR. I JU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE AS MUCH AUTHORITY AS NEEDED AS LOCAL CONDITIONS CHANGE. COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN -- EXCUSE ME, MAY I HAVE THE ABILITY TO LOWER HANDS AS WELL? THANK YOU. COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN?
00:12:29.976: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR, AND THANK YOU ALSO FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ALONGSIDE COUNCILMEMBER LUMM ON YOUR ORIGINAL MEDIA APPEARANCES INDICATED THAT THIS WOULD BE THE DOWNTOWN DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY DISTRICT OR THE DOWNTOWN DISTRICT, BUT THE LANGUAGE DOESN'T SPECIFY JURISDICTION OR BOUNDARIES. SHOULD WE ASSUME THAT THIS IS CITY-WIDE?
00:12:53.433: >> IT IS A CITY ORDINANCE.
00:12:56.002: >> OKA IT  CITY WI.
00:12:57.470: >> COUNCILMBER ACKERMA  I VE NO PREFERENCE EITHER Y. I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE I CLEAR. SO, THANK YOU.
00:13:02.676: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ENSURE THAT IT IS NOTED THAT COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI WAS FRONT AND CENTER ON THIS.
00:13:09.916: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN: THANK YOU COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI AS WELL, OF COURSE.
00:13:14.020: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
00:13:14.921: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  THANK YOU FOR THE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT, MAYOR, AND FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPK, AND THANKS  THE ATTORNEY'S OFFICE IN HELPING WITH THIS. MS. LEI AND LARCOM DID A LOT OF THE HEAVY LIFTING, AS WE ALL KNOW, WHEN IT COMES TO THESE METERS. BUT THE INTENT AND PURPOSE OF THIS IS, I BELIEVE, CLEAR, BUT TO RESPOND TO COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER'S QUESTIONS ON THE SUNSE PROVISION, I BELIEVE THE GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF MICHIGAN HAS DEMONSTRATED UNEQUIVOCALLY VERY RESPONSIBLE ACTIONS THAT SHE HAS TAKEN SINCE THE DECLARATION WAS DECLARED ON MARCH 13TH FOR A STATE OF EMERGENCY, AND I WOULD FEEL COMFORTABLE USING THAT AS OUR NORTH STAR IN A LOT OF THIS. WE WANT TO BE CONSISTENT. WE WANT TO HAVE THIS LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT TAKE ACTION AND ADDRESS THE SITUATION. WE HAVE SEEN THE STATE TAKE IT AND THE COUNTY TAKE IT, AND NOW WE ARE BRINGING THIS TO COUNCIL FOR COUNCIL'S CONSIDERATION TO DO OUR PART LOCALLY, AND AS WE KNOW, THE STUDENTS HAVE ARRIVED. THEY A BACK, AND IT'S A SCARY SIATION OUT THERE. THE ASSURANCES THAT WERE GIVEN TO US ARE NOT NECESSARILY ASSURANCES, BUT THE PROGRAMS OUTLINED BY THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, THE EDUCATIONAL TOOLS AND THE REQUESTS THAT THEY HAVE MADE FOR THE STUDENT BODY TO BEVE IN RESNSIBLE WAY, UNFORTUNATELY, IS NOT LOOKING LIKE IT'S GOING AS PLANNED. WE ARE RECEIVING MANY REPORTS TO THE CONTRARY, AND STUDENTS ARE BACK EARLY. IN FACT, I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE MAYBE MOVED ON THIS, BUT WE WERE WAITING FOR THE COUNTY TO MOVE HAVE THAT AS A PART OF THE  AND ORDINANCE HERE IN ENFORCEMENT, AND SO, AGAIN, THIS IS A CIVIL INFRACTION, UP THERE WITH, YOU KNOW, PARKING TICKETS AND NOT REMOVING YOUR SNOW IN THE TIME THAT OUR ORDINANCE ASKS AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. THIS IS NOT A MISDEMEANORMENT WE AND PUNITI TTHE MOST ISNG VULNERABLE IN OUR COMMUNITY, THE HOMELESS AND THE MENTALLY ILL AND ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED. THIS IS TO, AGAIN, ADDRESS WHAT IS NOW UPON US, AND THE CITY'S POPULATION HAS GROWN DRAMATICALLY, AND IT'S GROWN IN THE PART OF THE SEGMENT THAT POSES THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE AND RISK TO THE REST OF THE COMMUNITY AND WORLD. SO, YOU KNOW, I'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT FOR NOW, AND I APPRECIATE, AGAIN, THE WORK THAT COUNCILMEMBER MM AND THE MAYOR'S ACTION DECLARING A STATE OF EMERGENCY HERE LOCALLY WILL ALLOW US TO ACT IMMEDIATELY. AND, AGAIN, IT'S NOT LISTED ON THE AGENDA, BUT IF I COULD BE ADDED AS A COSPONSOR TO THIS, TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS NOTED CORRECTLY. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY.
00:16:32.018: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD?
00:16:34.020: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD:  JUST MINO SUE. I THINK A COUPLE OF WORDS MAY BE MISSING. 3(B) STATES THE CHILD OLDER THAN FIVE YEARS, AND 4(A), THE PERSON IS YOUNGER THAN FIVE YEARS. SO, I THINK WE ARE MISSING THE FIVE-YEAR-OLD, AND I DON'T KNOW WHICH CATEGORY THEY BELONG IN.
00:16:57.677: >> MAYOR TLOR:  MS. LARC?
00:17:14.961: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD: SHE'S MUTED.
00:17:15.929: >> KRISTEN LARCOM:  OKAY, I'M HERE. I S CHECKING ON THE QSTION THAT COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER HAD ASKED. BUT, FIRST OF ALL, LET ME LOOK AT THIS. "PERSON OLDER THAN FIVE YEARS," YES, IT SHOULD JUST BE OLDER THAN FIVE YEARS AND YOUNGER THAN 18.
00:17:38.384: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD:  AND THEN 4(A) HAS AERSON YOUNGE THAN 5. SO THE FIVE-YEAR-OLD ISN'T COVERED IN EITHER CATEGORY.
00:17:46.259: >> KRISTEN LARCOM:  OH, I SEE THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. SO, OKAY. I HAVE GOT TO REMEMBER WHAT WAS IN THE -- I WAS GIVEN THE ONE FROM STATE COLLEGE.
00:17:58.972: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD: OKAY.
00:17:59.939: >> KRISTEN LARCOM:  AND THAT IS WHAT WAS BEING REESTED, SO LET ME JUST LOOKEAQUICK HE. PARENTS, DA-DA-DA...  WEAR FACE MASKS...  (QUIETLY READING TO SELF.) I'M SORRY.
00:18:27.900: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD: NO, THAT'S OKAY, AND I DON'T KNOW IF THIS COULD MAYBE JUST BE CHANGED LATER AS A MINOR EDIT.
00:18:35.308: >> SUGGESTING TO STRIKE OLDER THAN.
00:18:37.777: >> KRISTEN LARCOM:  IT'S SORT OF A COMBINATION OF WHAT'S IN THE GOVERNOR'S -- "YOUNGER THAN FIVE YEARS OLD ARE EXEMPT," SO, FIVE YEARS AND OLDER IT'S APPLICABLE TO. SO, THE LANGUAGE SHOULD BE FIVE YEARS OLD AND YOUER -- THE CHILD NEEDS TO BE FIVE YEARS OLD, AT LEAST, AND YOUNGER THAN 18. AND IT APPLIES THEN.
00:19:27.493: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD:  OH, OKAY. SO YOU'RE GOG TO STRIKE OUT COUPLEF WORDS THE.
00:19:32.565: >> KRISTEN LARCOM:  AH.
00:19:33.099: >> COUNCMEMBER GRISWOLD: THAT'S NE I JUST KNOW FIVE-YEAR-OLDS CARRY A LOT OF GERMS [ LAUGHTER ]. I HAVE ONE IN MY HOUSE.
00:19:40.473: >> KRISTEN LARCOM:  RIGHT. AND REAL QUICKLY, IF I CAN ANSWER THE QUESTION THAT COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER WAS ASKING, AN ORDINANCE - THE ORDINANCE- THE CITY CODE OF ORDINANCES PROVIDES ANY ORDINANCE OR RULE CHANGE UNDER THIS AUTHORITY SUBSECTION SHALL BE TEMPORARY, AND UPON THE GOVERNOR'S DECLARATION THAT A STATE OF DISASTER OR STATE OF EMERGENCY IS TERMINATED SHALL NO LONGER IN EFFECT, SO IT DOES AUTOMATICALLY TERMINATE WHEN THE EMERGENCY ISERMINATED.  TE
00:20:24.016: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION?
00:20:28.421: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  I JUST HAVE A QUICK QUESTION, IF I COULD. I'M SORRY I DIDN'T RAISE MY HAND.
00:20:36.863: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  ALL RIGHT, COUNCILMEMBER.
00:20:39.999: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  WE HAD A COUPLE OF EMAILS TODAY ASKING ABOUT THE K-12, AND THAT'S BEEN ADDRESSED. NOW WE HAVE ALSO PLACES OF WORSHIP, WHERE PEOPLE ARE OUTSIDE OF THE BUILDING, PRACTICING SAFE DISTANCE. ARE THEY REQUIRED UNDER THIS ORDINANCE TO WEAR MASKS, IF THEY ARE OUTSIDE OF THE BUILDING OF WORSHIP?
00:21:21.574: >> KRISTEN LARCOM:  THIS ORDINANCE DOESN'T SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS TH. HOWEVER, IF THEY ARE AT THEIR PLACE OF WORSHIP, THEY ARE EXEMPT, AND ALSO IF THEY ARE IN A PRIVATE BUILDING, A BUILDING THAT'S NOT OPEN TO THE PUBLIC BECAUSE THE MASK REQUIREMENT ONLY APPLIES TO A PUBLIC -- PUBLIC PLACES INDOORS, OR IF THEY ARE OUTDOORS, THEY JUST HAVE TO BE SIX -- AT LEAST SIX FEET AWAY FROM PERSONS OF A DIFFERENT HOUSEHOLD.
00:22:00.179: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  OKAY. THANK YOU.
00:22:04.484: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  RTHER DISCUSSION? I AM PLEASED THAT THIS IS MOVING FORWARD. I THINK AS WE ALL UNDERSTAND, THE METHOD TO SLOW THE SPREAD OF DEPENDS  A THOUSAND INDIVIDUALT ACTIONS, ALL AGGREGATING TO EFFECTIVE PUBLIC HEALTH. THE DIRECTION THAT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR US BY THE LEADERSHIP OF THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEADERSHIP OF THE HEALTH OFFICER HERE IN WASHTENAW COUNTY IS VERY CLEAR. WHEN YOU'RE OUTSIDE, WEAR YOUR MASK. WHEN YOU'RE INSIDE, WEAR YOUR MASK. DO NOT AGGREGATE IN GROUPS OUTSIDE OF OVER 25. DO NOT AGGREGATE IN GROUPS INSIDE OF OVER TEN. OBSERVE RIGOROUS HAND HYGIENE, BUNDLING ALL OF THESE ACTIVITIES TOGETHER, EACH OF US DOING OUR PART, WHETHER YOU'RE A RESIDENT WHO HAOME TNN ARBOR FOR THFIRST TIME TAY OR WHETHER YOU ARE, YOU KNOW, WERE BORN HERE DECADES AGO AND ARE NOW ENJOYING THE PLEASURES OF GLACIER HILLS. ALL OF US HAVE A CRUCIAL ROLE TO PLAY IN MAINTAINING OUR OWN PERSONAL HEALTH AND THE PERSONAL HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY, AND I'M PLEASED AND PROUD THAT COUNCIL IS TAKING THIS STEP, FOR OUR OWN PART, TO RATIFY AND SUPPORT THE EXCELLENT WORK DONE BY OUR COUNTY HEALTH OFFICER AND OUR GOVERNOR. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
00:23:41.514: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  THANK YOU, AND I KNOW WE SPOKE ABOUT THIS QUITE A BIT, AND WE DID TALK ABOUT IT WITH THE UNIVERSI'S LEADERSHIP, AND I JUST WANT TO REITERATE THAT WHAT WAS MISSING PRIOR TO THIS WAS ENFORCEMENT, AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE CALL UPON THE FOLKS WHO ARE IN CHARGE OF ENFORCEMENT, IN ADDITION TO THEIR EFFORTS IN EDUCATI. THE ACTIVE AND -- YOU KNOW, BE ACTIVE AND CONSISTENT IN ENFORCEMENT. I JUST -- I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE A STICK TO GO ALONG WITH THE CARROT. OTHERWISE, WITHOUT REPERCUSSIONS OF BREAKIN THE SOCIAL CONTRACT, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE BIGGER PROBLEMS THAN WE ALREADY DO, AND I FEAR WHAT WILL COME IN A FEW WEEKS IF THINGS CONTINUE TO GO THE WAY THEY ARE RIGHT NOW. WE WILL BE SHUT WN BK I PHASE II WITHIN WEEKS IF WE DON'T GET A HANDLE ON THE SITUATION CURRENTLY. THE NEW POPULATION THAT IS JUST COMING TO TOWN IS NOT SHOWING THE BEHAVIOR AND THE RESTRAINT THAT WE HAD HOPED THEY WOULD HAVE, AND I REALLY HOPE THAT WE TAKE THIS ANDUT IT TO WOR
00:25:25.184: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR?
00:25:28.821: >> AYE.
00:25:32.591: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  ALL OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. DC3, RECOMMENDATION FOR CITY ADMINISTRATOR SEARCH PROCS, NEXTSTEPS.
00:25:41.367: >> COUILMBER RAMLA:  I'M SOY. TOM HAD A QUTION.
00:25:45.971: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  MR. CRAWFORD I ASSUME JUST RAISED HIS HAND TO CUT OUT.
00:25:50.643: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  OH, OKAY.
00:25:51.544: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  WHICH IS INAPPROPRIATE. I'M GOING TO ASSUME THAT HE HAS STEPPED OUT.
00:26:04.423: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER: MR. MAYOR, IF I MAY, DID I SEE MR. COX POP IN AND RAISE HIS HAND? I WONDERED IF HE WANTED TO OPINE ON HIS ENFORCING A MISDEMEANOR.
00:26:18.137: >> IT'S A CIVIL INFRACTION.
00:26:20.973: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  I'M SORRY. I SAW HIM COME OUT, AND I CODN'T GET BACKO THEUTE RE. I KNOW WE HAVE GONE BEYOND IT ALREADY.
00:26:29.215: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  I HAVE NO OBJECTION WITH SUPPLEMENTARY WISDOM FROM CHIEF COX. CHIEF COX?
00:26:39.525: >> I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY, WE WILL DEFINITELY ALWAYS TRY TO BE CONSISTENT. I THINK WE HAVE BEEN. VERY RARELY CAN YOU ENFORCE YOUR WAY OUOF ANYTHING. AS A MATTER OF FACT, I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S THE CASE -- WITH VERY FEW THINGS IN THIS WORLD. SO WE WILL CONTINUE TO TRY TO EDUCATE, AND WE WILL CERTAINLY ENFORCE IT APPROPRIATELY. SO, THAT'S ALL. I JUST WANTED TO LET PEOPLE FEEL ASSURED THAT WE HEAR YOU, BUT THE REALISTICHING HERE IS THAT ENFORCEMENT IS USUALLY NEVER THE TOTAL SOLUTION. SO, BUT WE WILL BE CONSISTENT.
00:27:18.397: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU.
00:27:19.632: >> CHIEF COX:  YOU'RE WELCOME.
00:27:22.067: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  I DON'T THINK WE HAD A MOTION -- A SECOND, SO RESOLUTION TO -- MOVED AND SECONDED, MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRAND. THANK YOU. DISCUSSION, PLEASE, OF DC3. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
00:27:44.723: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I'LL JUST TEE THIS UP, BECAUSE AS WE KNOW, IT NEEDS TO BE AMENDED WITH FURTH GUIDCE. AS ESTLIEDN OUR SRCH OCESS, TODAY IS THEARGET DAY FOR CITY COUNCIL TO IDENTIFY NEXT STEPS REGARDING THE APPOINTMENT OF A PERMANENT CITY ADMINISTRATOR. BEFORE JUMPING TO THAT, HOWEVER, I WOULD LIKE TO QUICKLY REVIEW THE PROCESS AND THANK AMY STAHLS FOR HER EXCELLENT LEADERSHIP THROUGHOUT. IN LATE JUNE, COUNCIL VOTED TO ENGAGE AMY AS OUR SEARCH CONSULNT. E PITIONAS POSTE JULY 1ST THROUGH JULY 26TH, AND MORE THAN 250 RESUMÉS WERE RECEIVED. ON AUGUST 5TH, COUNCIL WAS PROVIDED WITH A POOL OF CANDIDATES AND SELECTED ONE ON AUGUST 20TH. ALSO ON THE 20th, AN ON PUBLIC SURVEY W GUN, AND THIS IS A PUBLIC FEEDBACK OPPORTUNITY THAT WE HAVE NOT PROVIDED PREVIOUSLY ON PRIOR SEARCHES. WE THANK EACH OF THE FOUR FINALISTS FOR THEIR INTEREST IN THE POSITION AND FOR TAKING THE TIME TO MEET WITH THE THREE GROUPS. AS I MENTIONED, AUGUST 24TH WAS IDENTIFIED BY COUNCIL AS THE TARGET DATE FOR CITY COUNCIL TO DETERMINE NEXT EP WHETH IT WAS TO BEGIN NEGOTTIONS WITH ONE CANDIDATE, CONDUCT INTERVIEWS WITH FINALISTS, OR WHETHER TO START THE PROCESS BACK OVER. I'M GOING TO BE BRIEF. I THINK THE CASE FOR APPOINTING MR. CRAWFORD IS A COMPELLING ONE. LLUICKLY MAK A STATEMENT ABOUT WHY I BELIEVE THE CASE IS COMPELLING TO APPOINTMENT MR. CRAWFORD. MR. CRAWFORD HAS DEMONSTRATED HIS EFFECTIVENESS IN DOING THE JOB THREE TIMES. MR. CRAWFORD HAS VERY BROAD APPEAL IN ALL THREE GROUPS, COUNCIL, STAFF, AND THE COMMUNITY. AND OF THE THREE GROUPS OF INTERVIEWERS, THERE'S A POLL OF COUNCILMBERS, 12 STF, AND 14 COMMUNITY MEMBER AND OF THAT TOTAL OF 36, 19 OR 53% STRONGLY RECOMMENDED TOM, NINE MORE RECOMMENDED TOM, AND SO OVERALL THERE'S 78% OF APPOINTING MR. CRAWFORD, AND ONLY 11% DO NORECOMMEND TOM. ESPECIALLYOR SEONE WHO HAS BEEN AROUND FOR 15 YEARS. COUNCILMEMBERS GENERALLY HAVE GREAT VIEWS ON MR. CRAWFORD, AND NOT ONE SAID THEY DO NOT RECOMMEND MR. CRAWFORD, WHICH I THINK SPEAKS OF HIS ABILITY TO STAY ABOVE THE POLITICAL FRAY, TO MANAGE AND TREAT EVERYONE WITH RESPECT. WE HAD TEN RESPONSES ON SEVEN ATTRIBUTES, AND 50 OR 71% EXCEEDS EXPECTATIONS, 18 OR 26% MEETS EXPECTATIONS, AND ONE RATING WAS NO OPINION. ONE RATING WAS DOES NOT MEET EXPECTATIONS. WHEN 97% OF ATTRITEATINGS ARE ME OR EXCEEDEQREMENTS AND THREE QUARTERS OF THOSE ARE EXCEEDS, THAT DEFINES AN INCREDIBLY STRONG CANDIDATE. IN OTHER WORDS, MR. CRAWFORD IS WAY MORE THAN THE SAFE CHOICE. HE HAS THE SKILLS AND HAS ALREADY DONE THE JOB EFFECTIVELY THREE TIMES. MR. CRAWFORD'S FINANCIAL UMEN, CALM DEMEANOR AND EERTISE IN CITY GOVERNMENT IS ESPECIALLY NEEDED NOW, WITH INITIATIVES LIKE A2 ZERO AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING. HOWEVER, SOME HAVE ARGUED THAT IN ADDITION TO MR. CRAWFORD, THERE IS ANOTHER CANDIDATE WHO DESERVES FURTHER CONSIDERATION, AND FOR THAT REASON WE SHOULD KE A COUPLE OFEEKS TO INVITE BOTH BACK FOR ADDITIONAL INTERVIEWS IN SOME FORM. I WOULD BE COMFORTABLE WITH THAT TOO AND THINK IT IS A REASONABLE REQUEST, ALTHOUGH I WOULD LIKE TO REITERATE, AS I SAID AT THE ONSET, THAT I AM READY TO SUPPORT APPOINTING MR. CRAWFORD, AND I THINK OUR COMMUNITY WOULD BE -- I DON'T THINK. I KNOWUR COMMUNITY WOULD BE IN HIS EXPERT, PROFESSIONAL GOOD NDS, WERE WE TO SELECT HIM AS THE NEXT CITY ADMINISTRATOR. THANK YOU.
00:32:10.389: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FOR MY PART -- THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER. WOULD LIKE VERY MUCH TO, YO KNOW, THANK ALL OF THE CANDIDATES WHO CAME AND SPOKE TO US, CAME AND SPOKE TO STAFF, AND, OF COURSE, TO THE PUBLIC PANEL. YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, WE ARE GRATEFUL AND BETTER WE ARE GRATEFUL ANDETR FOR HAVI LISTENED, AND, YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT LOOKING THROUGH THE TALLIES OF THE RESPONSES, LOOKING THROUGH THE TALLIES OF THE DATA THAT WE HAVE RECEIVED, YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT -- AND I THINK THIS IS CONFIRMED BY THE RECOMMENDATION FROM OUR HUMAN RESOURCES PRESSIONALHAWE HAVE RETAINED, THAT THE TWO CANDIDATES, MR. CRAWFORD AND MS. PAVLOCHEK WARRANT FURTHER INQUIRY; THAT IS TO SAY, WARRANT A FURTHER OPPORTUNITY TO COME AND SPEAK TO STAFF, SPEAK TO THE PUBLIC ON A BROADER AND,OU KNOW, A TTLE BIT PERHAPS A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A FREE-FLOWING BASIS, OR IN WHATEVER MANNER, WHATEVER FORUM, YOU KNOW, MS. SELLE IN HER EXPERTISE I GUESS RECOMMENDS TO US. TO EFFECT THAT PROCESS, TO EFFECT THE FURTHER INQUIRIES OF MR. CRAWFORD AND MS. PA MMS. PAVLOCHEK, I HAVE FORWARDED A PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO THE RESOLUTION TO COUNCIL, IF SOMEONE WOULD BE SO KIND AS TO MOVE THAT. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER SMITH, SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER GRAND -- WE'LL HAVE THAT GOING FORWARDS THE LOCUS OF DISCUSSION. FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO DON'T HAVE THE TEXT IN FRONT OF THEM, LET ME READ IT. IT WOULD SERVE TO REPLACE THE LAST RESOLVED CLAUSE ON D3 WITH THE FOLLOWING:  "RESOLVED, THAT THE CITY COUNCIL REQUESTS A SUPPLEMENTAL INTERVIEW PROCESS, INCLUDING ADDITIONAL STAFF AND PUBLIC INTERACTIONS WITH CANDIDATES TOM CRAWFORDND KARA PAVLOCHEK AND REQUESTS FOR RECRUITER AMY SELLE TO DEVELOP WITH INPUT FROM COUNCILMEMBERS TO IMPLEMENT THAT PROCESS, AND GIVING MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC SUFFICIENT TIME TO COMMUNICATE TO CITY COUNCIL, RESOLVED THAT SUBJECT TO CANDIDATE AVAILABILITY THIS INTERVIEW PROCESS TAKE PLACE BEFORE THE CITY COUNCIL MEET O THAT SEPTEMBER 14, 2020, IN SPECIAL SESSION TO VOTE ON THE NDES AND/OR REVIEW OR DETERMINE NEXT STEPS. IN MY VIEW, I THINK THAT REFLECTS THE CONSENSUS OF CERTAINLY THE STAFF AND PUBLIC, AND I THINK THE THRUST OF THE COUNCIL AS WELL,ND I THINK IT GIVES AURANCE TO FOS WHO WANT TO HAVE MORE ENGAGEMENT IN THE PROCESS. FINALLY, IT DOES NOT DALLY. IT MOVES US FORWARD IN AN EXPEDITIOUS FASHION, COMMENSURATE WITH THE IMPORTANCE OF THE TASK. I HAVE GOT COUNCILMEMBER SMITH, GRISWOLD AND NELSON ON THE AMENDMENT. COUNCILMEMBER SMITH?
00:35:28.020: >> COUNCILMEMBER SMITH:  SO, IDEALLY, I THINK ALL OFS WLD HAVE REALLY LIKED TO HAVE HAD A PROCESS THAT INVOLVES THE COMMUNITY AND ALLOWS EVERYBODY THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET BEHIND THE SELECTED CANDIDATE SO THAT THAT INDIVIDUAL IS SET UP FOR SUCCESS MOVING FORWARD. NOW, THE PROCESS SO FAR THAT WE HAVE ENDED UP WITH IS, AS COUNCILMEMBER LUMM NOTED, WE HAVE HAD FEEDBACK FROM ABOUT 87 INDIVIDUALS, 59 MEMBERS OF THE GENEL PUBLIC, ANTHOSE 59 PEOPLE HAD ABOUT FOUR HOU AFTER THEY WATCHED OUR SESSION LAST THURSDAY NIGHT TO FILL OUT THE QUESTIONNAIRE. BY COMPARISON, THE PROCESS TO SELECT OUR POLICE CHIEF AND OUR COMMUNITY AREA SERVICE ADMINISTRATOR HAD EXTENSIVE OPPORTUNITY FROM RESIDENTS OF ALL WALKS OF LIFE TO ASK QUESTIONS AND TO WEIGH IN WITH THEIR OPIONS ABOUTACH OF THE CANDIDATES. YOU KNOW, SO I THINK CERTAINLY I BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO PROVIDE THE COMMUNITY THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH AND VET THESE CANDIDATES. AS I STATED IN MY OPENING, I WAS HOPING OUR PROCESS WOULD LEAD TO A UNANIMOUS VOTE FOR THE NEXT POTIONED FOR SUCCESS, YOU KNOW, AND I WILL SAY THAT I CONCUR WITH THE RECOMMENDATION FROM MS. SELLE, THAT BRINGING BACK THE TOP SCORES FOR AN ADDITIONAL PRESENTATION FOR THEIR VISION FOR THE ORGANIZATION, FOR THE CITY, AND A PRESENTATION THAT ALLOWS FOR ROBUST QUESTIONS AND INTERACTION WITH THE COMMUNITY, AND WHEN I SAY "COMMUNITY," I MEAN IN THE WIDEST SENSE POSSIBLE. YOU KNOW, SO THAT'S WHY I'M SUPPORTING THIS AMENDMENT. I THINK THAT THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT POSITION IN THE CITY. YOU KNOW, WE HAVE NOT BEEN AT THIS IN-DEPTH FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS, AND I THINK GIVING IT ANOTHER COUPLE OF WEEKS AND GIVING THE COMMUNITY AN OPPORTITY TO WEIGHN ON TS IN A MORE PURPOSEFUL WAY I THINK WOULD BENEFIT ALL OF US. THANK YOU.
00:37:29.508: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
00:37:33.745: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD:  AT THIS POINT, I JUST WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE PROCESS, A PROCESS WHEREBWE APPROVED A DETAILED OUTLINE OF MOVING FORWARD. TODAY, ONE HOUR BEFORE THE MEETING, WE RECEIVED AN EMAIL FROM OUR MAYOR, ONE HOUR. DURING THE MEETING, WE ARE RECEIVING EMAILS FROM OUR CITY ATTORNEY. IT'S AGAINST POLICY TO EVEN BE REINGMAILS DURING A MEETING. WE HAD A VERY DIVISIVE PRIMARY. THERE ARE MANY WHO HAVE SAID THAT HONESTY WAS NOT THE STRONG SUIT OF SOME OF OUR LEADERS. I HAVE NO CONFIDENCE IN THIS LEADERSHIP THAT WE WILL BE UNITED. WEERE N UNITED IN THIS PROCESS, AND AN EMAIL AN HOUR BEFORE THE MEETING DOES NOTHING TO UNITE, AND I AM VERY, VERY DISAPPOINTED IN HOW WE ARE MOVING FORWARD OR MOVING BACKWARDS, AND I'LL SAVE THE REST OF MY COMMENTS FOR LATER. THANK YOU.
00:38:45.851: >> MOR TLOR:  UNCILMEMBER
00:38:46.451: >> COUNCILMBER NELSON:THANK I APPRECIATE THE COMPARISON TO THE SEARCHOR THE POLICE CHIEF, BECAUSE, ACTUALLY, THAT POSITION IS VERY, VERY DIFFERENT. IT MAKES SENSE THAT HIRING A NEW POLICE CHIEF DEMANDED SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC INPUT, BECAUSE THE JOB OF LEADING OUR POLICE DEPARTMENT HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT AND DAILY INDIVIDUAL INTERACTIONS WITH MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. IN CONTRAST, THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR WORKS AND COLLABORATES PRIMARILY WITH CITY STAFF AND CITY COUNCIL. COMMUNITY LEADERS AND HEADS OF OTHER LOCAL INSTITUTIONS WILL PARTNER WITH THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR, BUT MOST MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WOULD NEVER HAVE A REASON TO WORK DIRECTLY WITH THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR. IN THE MONTHS LEADING UP TO THE ANNOUNCEMENT, WE DID HAVE INPUT OM OUR SFF ABO IERNAL WORK ENVIRONMENTS. R THE INTERVIEW PROCESS THIS WEEK, SPECIAL STATUS WASRANTED TO THE WINNERS OF THE RECENT AUGUST PRIMARY ELECTIONS. LEADERS FROM LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS AND INSTITUTIONS OUTSIDE OF HALL WAS EXPANDED TO INCLUDE FIVE FUTURE MEMBERS OF CITY COUNCIL. THIS WAS UNPRECEDENTED. UNFORTUNATELY, THEIR RESPONSE TO BEINGNCLUD TS WAY WAS TO POLITICIZEHIS DECISIONND PROMOTE THE IDEA THAT THIS PROCESS IS RUSHED. THESE FEW -- I APPRECIATE THAT THESE FEW MONTHS BETWEEN AUGUST PRIMARIES AND NOVEMBER GENERAL ELECTIONS ARE AWKWARD. I REMEMBER THIS FROM 2018. IN THE FINAL FEW WEEKS BEFORE MEMBERS WERE SEATED IN 2018, COUNCIL MEETINGS RAN VERY LONG AND VERY LAT IN ORDERO FINALIZE T ORDINANCE FOR OUR INDEPENDENT COMMUNITY POLICE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION. I STILL BELIEVE THAT CITY COUNCIL DID NOT EMPOWER THAT COMMISSION AS MUCH AS IT COULD HAVE DURING THAT ORIGINAL ORDINANCE PROCESS, BUT IT WAS NOT UP TO ME, AND IT NEVER OCCURRED TO ME SO SUGGEST THAT THEY POSTPONE THEIR DECISION MAKING BY ONE MONTH TO INCLUDE ME. ELECTIONMEANS THAT T WINNERS OF PRIMARIES ARE NOT SEATED UNTIL MONTHS LATER. THIS IS THE SYSTEM ESTABLISHED IN OUR CITY CHARTER. I HAVE GOTTEN A COUPLE OF EMAILS TODAY THAT ACTUALLY SUGGESTED THIS DECISION BE POSTPONED UNTIL NOVEMBER. I'M RELIEVED THAT IT WAS ONLY A COUPLE, BUT I DON'T THINK ANY RESIDENT OF ANN ARBOR, OUR EDUCATED CITY, SHOULD COMFORTAE PITCHING TSEAME ARGUMENTS THAT MITCH McCONNELL DID IN 2016 REGARDING MERCK GARLAND. THE DECISION BEFORE US SHOULD NOT BE CONTENTIOUS. WE RECEIVED A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF INFORMATION ABOUT ALL FOUR OF THE CANDIDATES, ONE OF WHOM IS A RESPECTED MEMBER OF OUR LAL MMUNITY. WE SULD AL BE DISTURB THAT IN THE INTEREST OF SEWING LOCAL DIVISIONS, A SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE ARE ADOPTING THE REASON OF OUR MOST UNDEMOCRATIC NATIONAL LEADERS. I AM AFRAID THAT THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF A SLIPPERY SLOPE, AND IT IS UGLY. AND I AM READY TO MAKE A DECISION TONIGHT. I DO NOT WANT TO POSTPONE THIS DECISION. WE HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATI BEFORE US. THANK U.
00:41:44.596: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER HAER?
00:41:45.463: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER: THANKS, MR. MAYOR. THAT'S INTERESTING WHAT COUNCILMEMBER NELSON JUST SAID. IT'S TRUE, WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT, LIKE, I RECEIVED AN EMAIL TODAY TOO WHERE IT'S BASICALLY SAYING THAT THREE OF US SITTING HERE SHOULDN'T EVEN HAVE A WORD TO SAY ABOUT IT AND THAT THEIR PRESUMPTIVE --N ONLS CH AS THEY ARE GNG TO APPEAR ALONON THE BALLOT IN NOVEMBER, FOLKS -- SHOULD HAVE MORE OF A SAY, WHICH IS NOT ONLY AN UNUSUAL TWIST OF LOGIC, AS COUNCILMEMBER NELSON POINTED OUT, BUT REALLY A CHARTER-BUSTING EFFORT TO EXPAND THE POWER OF PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T EVEN RAISED THEIR HAND IN FRONT OF THE CLERK AND BEEN SWORN IN SO, THESE FOLKS WHO AREN'T EVEN COUNCILMEMBERS-ELECT HAVE THE SAME WEIGHT IN THE PROCESS AS ANY OTHER MEMBER OF OUR COMMUNITY DOES, IN MY OPINION. BUT SETTING THAT ASIDE FOR A MOMENT, I HAVE A CONCERN WITH THIS BECAUSE HOW WOULD -- IF THE CONCERN IS THAT WE HAVEN'T HAD ENOUGH PUBLIC INPUT INTO THIS ARING LKS SAY, HOW HAV WE DETERMINED THAT WE ARE ONLY GOING TO MOVE FORWARD WITH TWO CANDIDATES? WE HAD FOUR CANDIDATES JUST LAST WEEK, AND NOT ENOUGH INPUT ON THOSE FOUR. SO, WHERE DID IT GO FROM 250 TO 150 TO 4 TO 2? IT'S NOT -- THIS ISN'T -- THIS ISN'T A GAME SHOW, YOU KNOW. ERE WERE FR LAST WEEK AND I WOULD LIKE -- IF WE ARE GOING TO EXTEND THIS COURTESY OF EXPANDING PUBLIC INPUT, I WOULD EXTEND THE COURTESY OF EXPANDING PUBLIC INPUT TO ALL FOUR CANDIDATES. SO THAT'S HOW I FEEL ABOUT THAT. AND I'M -- I WONDER HOW THE PROCESS WILL WORK IN THIS ZOOM TIME. IT WASICE TO HA IN THE POLICE CHIEF SELECTION, WHERE WE WERE ABLE TO GO MEET HIM AND PEOPLE COULD COME DOWN TO CITY HALL, AND THEY WENT OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY AND SO ON. TIMES WERE MUCH MORE AMENABLE TO THAT KIND OF COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND BEHAVIOR, SO I AM NOT SURE I AGREE WITH THIS NOTION. I'M GOING TO READ IT AGAIN AND THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME SPEAK.
00:43:58.062: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
00:43:58.963: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  THANK YOU, MAYOR. I SHARE A LOT OF THE CONCERNS MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SPOKEN ABOUT REGARDING THIS AMENDMENT. TO COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER'S POINT, THE FACT THAT WE ARE SELECTING ONLY TWO AND NOT ALL FOUR IS VERY TROUBLING. NOT ENOUGH COMMUNITY INPUT IN THIS, THEN ALL FOUR SHOULD BE LOOKED AT, NOT JUST TWO. IT IS INCONSISTENT AND INCOMPLETE. I CANNOT SUPPORT IT IF IT DOES NOT BRING ALL FOUR INTO THE FOLD FOR THE DISCUSSION. I THINK, AGAIN, TO COUNCILMEMBER GRISWO, BNGING THIS AHO BEFORE THE VOTE GIVES ME HEARTBURN. YOU KNOW, I WORK IN MY OTHER JOB 60 HOURS A WEEK, AND SOME OF US HAVE OTHER JOBS AND OTHER COMMITMENTS AND FAMILIES, AND, YOU KNOW, I JT FIND TRBLINTHAT IT'S BEEN A -- IT'S BEEN ALL TOO COMMON THAT THESE KIND OF THINGS COME IN VERY LAST MINUTE. AGAIN, WE ARE CHERRY-PICKING TWO OUT OF THE FOUR. WE ARE CHANGING THE PROCESSAND THE -- AFTER IT HAS BEGUN AND AGREED AND ACTED ON. THIS ROADMAP TO GET TO A DECISION WAS PUT FORTH A MONTH AGO, AND THERE WASN'T ANY OBJECTION TO THE CONCERNS THAT ARE BEING RAISED NOW. I DID NOT RECEIVE ANY EMAILS OM PEOPLE UNL AFTER THURSDAY, AND THAT TO ME ISN'T WHAT I WOULD HITCH MY WAGON TO, CHANGING THE RULES AFTER THE PROCESS HAS BEEN AGREED ON, ACTED ON, AND THEN, HEY, LET'S- ERE'S NOTHG THAT HAS ANGED SOUCH THAT SHOULD JUSTIFY US TO DO THAT. THERE REALLY HASN'T BEEN ANYTHING SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH TO SUGGEST THAT WE SHOULD CHANGE IT, AND I WOULD REFUTE THE ASSESSMENT THE MAYOR HAS SUGGESTED THAT TRE ARE MANY IN OUR COMMUNITY, D THERE'S CONSENSUS D A THRUSTO BRING THIS FORTH. I DON'T HEAR IT. I DON'T SEE IT. THERE'S A FEW FOLKS IN THE COMMUNITY THAT PUT OUT A MESSAGE TO GET SOME FOLKS TO EMAIL US THAT RESPONDED TO IT, BUT THIS IS NOT COMING FROM ORGANIC CONCERN. THIS IS ANOTHER KIND OF ORCHESTRATED CAMPAIGN, AND IT'S NOT THE ORGANIC CONCERNS THAT I GET ON MANY OTHER ISSUES. IT IS THIS COUNCIL WHO HAS THE CHARTER POWERS TO TAKE ON THESE DECISIONS. THIS IS NOT A COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT INVOLVEMENT, TO THE EXTENT THAT WE HAD WITH THE POLICE CHIEF. AGAIN, GOING BACK TO HOW COUNCILMEMBER NELSON HAD EXPLAINED IT, THAT PITION IS FAR DIFFERENT THAN OUR CITY ADMINISTRATOR, AND I THINK MAKING THE COMPARISON OF THAT SELECTION PROCESS TO THIS IS COMPARING APPLES TO ORANGES. AND, AGAIN, IT DOES NOT MEET MY LEVEL OF WHAT I WOULD CONSIDER IT WOULD TAKE  CHANGE THE RULES OF THE GAME ONCE THEYAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED. AND I APPRECIATE COUNCILMEMBER SMITH'S SENTIMENTS THAT WE SHOULD GET BEHIND WHOEVER WE CHOOSE AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE THE SUPPORT OF THE COMMUNITY AND THE SUPPORT OF COUNCIL TO TAKE ON THE EXTREME CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE. AND I, UNFORTUNATELY, SEE THIS AS A DETRIMENT TO THAT CONTENT AND TO THAT SENTIMENT. I THINK THIS IS ACTUALLY DETRIMENTAL TO GETTING THE SUPPORT WIDE AND DEEP BEHIND SOMEBODY TO LEAD OUR ORGANIZATION AND OUR CITY, AND I AM TROUBLED OF WHAT IS HAPPENING, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT JUST INCLUDES ONLY TWO AND NOT FOUR. THAT TO ME IS JUST -- I CAN'T GO ALONG WITH SOMETHING LIKE THAT. COUNLMEMBER ACKERM, ITH, AND HAYNER FOR MY PART, I WOULD VIEW AS FRIENDLY AN AMENDMENT TO INCLUDE ALL FOUR CANDIDATES. COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN IN THE QUEUE?
00:49:10.074: >> YOU BEAT ME TO IT.
00:49:14.112: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN: MR. GERHART, WOULD YOU MIND CIRCULATING AMENDMENT LANGUAGE? THANK YOU. I WOULDOVE AN AMENDNT TO TH AMENDMENT THAT STRIKES THE PHRASE "TOM CRAWFORD AND [ OFF MIC ] PAVLOCHEK" AND INSERTS ALL FOUR NEXT TO THE CANDIDATES. IS THAT FRIENDLY TO THE BODY?
00:49:37.768: >> NO.
00:49:38.002: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  ALL RIGHT. SO WE ARE ON THE AMENDMENT TO THE AMENDMENT.
00:49:43.341: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN:  SO I'LL --
00:49:44.375: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  HOLD ON.
00:49:46.244: >> DID IT HAVE A SECOND?
00:49:48.813: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  IT DID. GO AHEAD.
00:49:54.018: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER: MR. GERHART, COULD YOU ALSO CIRCULATE THE ACTUAL AMENDMENT THAT WE ARE SPEAKING ABOUT THAT CAME FM THE MAYOR? DO YOU HAVE THAT FOR CIRCULATION?
00:50:06.397: >> MR. GERHART:  I DO NOT HAVE THAT.
00:50:09.233: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  WE HAVE GOT -- ONE MOMENT.
00:50:12.537: >> I'LL FORWARD IT TO YOU.
00:50:14.172: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU. I'LL HOLD THE QUEUE ON ACKERMAN, GRAND, HAYNER, AND NEW QUEUE -- SO I'M PULLING YOU OFF. ON THE AMENDMENT, I HAVE GOT COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
00:50:29.353: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I UNDERSTAND THE SENTIMENT, BUT I -- I DO NOT [ OFF MIC ] WITH THIS AMENDMENT TO BRING ALL FOUR BACK, BECAUSE THE -- THERE WAS A CLEAR, VERY CLEAR IF YOU LOOK AT ALL OF THE FEEDBACK FROM ALL OF THE GROUPS, AND THE SURVEY DATA, THERE WAS A VERY CLEAR SEPARATION AMONG THE FOUR FINALISTS, AND, IN FACT, THE -- IT WAS REALLY BURCATED. THE STAFF RATINGS, EVERYONE'S RATINGS, THE COMMUNITY RATINGS, THEY -- THERE WAS A CLEAR SEPARATION, AND THEY WERE -- YOU KNOW, I APPRECIATE THAT THESE FOUR CDIDATES PARTICIPATED AND EXPRESSED INTEREST; TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY DID, APPLIED AND PARTICIPATED IN THE INTERVIEWS, BUT REALISTICALLY, AGAIN, IF YOU LOOK AT ALL OF THE FEEDBACK PROVIDED TO US, THERE WAA SIGNIFICT SEPARATION BETWN MR. CRAWFORD, M MS. PAVLOCHEK AND THE OTHER TWO CANDIDATES. IT WAS SIGNIFICANT AND ACROSS ALL OF THE GROUPS AND ACROSS THE PUBLIC'S ASSESSMENT. AGAIN, IT WAS BIFURCATED, AND SO I THINK THAT GIVEN THAT, GIVEN THE FEEDBACK WE HAVE BEEN PROVIDED, IT WOULD NOT BE APPROPRIATE TO BRING BACK ALL FOUR. I MEAN, THE CLEAR -- THERE WAS A REAL CLEAR SEPARATION IN THE DATA, AND SO THAT'S WHY I WOULD NOT BE SUPPORTING THIS AMENDMENT.
00:52:35.046: >> MAYOR TAYR:  COUNCILMEMBER
00:52:35.680: >>OUNCILMEMBER ACKERMA THANK YOU, MR. MAR, AND THANK YOU TO COLLEAGUES FOR ENTERTAINING THIS. I THINK INVITING MORE PUBLIC INPUT FOR THIS POSITION MAKES A LOT OF SENSE. WE HAVE HEARD COMPARISONS TO THE POLICE CHIEF, AND THE POLICE CHIEF BEING A POSITION THAT REQUIRES MORE PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT, AND SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE BROADER COMMUNITY HAVE MORE DIRECT INPUT INTO THAT INDIVIDUAL'S HIRING. BUT THE POLICE CHIEFS REPORT TO THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR, AND SO DO ALL OF THE OTHER STAFF WHO OVERSEE OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AND BAC SERVICES, O FIR SAFETY OUR PAR, OUR PLANNING AND REAL ESTATE SERVICES. THESE ARE ALL CRITICAL FUNCTIONS TO WHOM THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR OVERSEES, AND THE COMMUNITY CARES ABOUT THOSE ISSUES. I THINK, YOU KNOW, THE- I DON'T THINK TT THIS SHOULD WAIT UNTIL A NEW COUNCIL IS SEATED. I'M SITTING HERE RIGHT NOW. I WON'T BE IN NOVEMBER. I THINK MY LENS OF FIVE YEARS AT THE CITY COUNCIL TABLE WILL PROVIDE SOME VALUABLE INPUT, AS WILL THE TEN OTHER PEOPLE SITTING HERE, AND I THINK THAT'S PERFECTLY FINE. I THINK ASKING FOR THREE MORE WES TO GET THE COMMUNITY INVOLVED TO A HIGHER DEGREE, WHILE WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF A GLOBAL PANDEMIC, SEEMS VERY REASONABLE. I THINK -- I LOOK BACK TO OUR LAST PROCESS THAT INCLUDED MORE PANELS AND MEET AND GREETS WITH EACH OF THE POTENTIAL HIRES FOR CITY ADMINISTRATOR, AND I WOULD VE TO HAVE MOR OF THAT DECT OPPORTUNY FOR PEOPLE TO MEET THESE CANDIDATES, ASK THEM QUESTIONS THAT THEY CARE ABOUT, AND GIVE MORE DIRECT FEEDBACK. I CAN DRAW ON MY OWN EXPERIENCE. I'M A HIRING MANAGER AT MY DAY JOB. YOU KNOW, I MANAGE A TEAM OF FOUR, HIRED TWO OF THEM DIRECTLY, AND WHILE I DO T INTERVIEWS AND MY ASSESSMENT IS REALLYREALLY IMPORTA, THE OWNERS AND PARTNERS OF OUR FIRM ALWAYS INTERVIEW CANDIDATES, BECAUSE THEIR INPUT OF WHAT THE VISION FOR THE COMPANY IS REALLY MATTERS, AND HOW THAT PERSON WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE BROADER ORGAZAON REALLY MAERS. WE ALL HAV12000 BOSSES. WE ALL HE 120,000 COLLECTIVE OWNERS OF THIS COMMUNITY, WHO DESERVE ALSO THEIR OPPORTUNITY TO INTERACT WITH THESE CANDIDATES. AND PROVIDE MORE DIRECT INPUT. SO, YOU KNOW, I THINK COUNCILMEMBER NELSON RAISED THAT THIS IS A SLIPPERY SLOPE TGET US TO NOVEER. I DOT SEE ITHAT WAY. I DON'T WANT I TO BE THAT WAY, BUT I THINK WE HAVE GOT -- I THINK WE HAVE GOT FOUR HIGHLY COMPETENT PROFESSIONALS WHO DESERVE TO MEET THE COMMUNITY, AND THE COMMUNITY DESERVES TO MEET THEM. AND I LOVE WORKING WITH MR. CRAWFORD. DON'T GET ME WRONG. I THINK MR. CRAWFORD WILL SHINE THROUGH THIS OCESS, WITHO A DOUB HE I A -- HE IS A NEIGHBOR AND HAS BEEN AUBLIC SERVANT TO THESE STAKEHOLDERS FOR A LONG TIME, AND I THINK THERE'S GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR HIM, BUT I ALSO WANT TO GIVE THAT SAME OPPORTUNITY TO THREE OTHER CANDIDATES AS WELL.
00:56:14.899: >> MAY TLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, DID I PUT YOU IN THE QUEUE A SECOND TIME?
00:56:18.669: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  YEAH, I DON'T KNOW THOUGH IF I QUALIFY FOR A SECOND TIME OR NOT.
00:56:21.872: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  YOU DO. WE ARE ON THE AMENDMENT.
00:56:24.842: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  WELL, I DID SPEAK -- OKAY. THANKS. I DID SPEAK TO WHY I'M NOT SUPPORTING THIS, BECAUSE THE DATA, ALL OF THE FEEDBACK THAT WE PROVIDED WAS -- THERE WAS A CLEAR SEPARATION BETWEEN -- AMONGST THE FOUR, AND I ALSO JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT WITH THE PRIOR CITY ADMINISTRATOR SEARCH, WE HAD ONE MEET AND GREET, AND THEN WE HAD COMMENT CARDS THAT PEOPLE COULD FILL OUT AT THE MEET GREET. AS OFTEN HAPPENS, NOT A LOT OF FOLKS SHO UP - OBVIOUSLY A PRE-COVID MEET AND GREET. WE DID NOT DO A PUBLIC SURVEY, AND I THINK IT'S PRETTY SIGNIFICANT THAT WE HAVE DONE THAT THIS TIME AROUND, AND I HAVE PARTICIPATED IN A FEW CITY ADMINISTRATOR SEARCHES, AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT WE HAVE UTILIZED THAT INSTRUMENT, AND I THINK THAT'S NOT INSIGNIFICANT. AND AS YOU KNOW, WE HAVE BEEN FROM PEOPLINCE WE COMPLED MAILS OUR INTERVIEWS AND SUBMITTED OUR EVALUATIONS, AND YOU KNOW DIRECTIONALLY WHERE THAT INPUT HAS BEEN GUIDING US. IT'S BEEN PRETTY OVERWHELMING, IN FACT, SO I ALSO THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, JUST IN TERMS -- IN GENERAL, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE HAD A GOOD PROCESS, AT'S IDENTIFIED HIGHLY QUALIFIED CANDIDATES, AND AS COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD NOTED, THE PROCESS WAS -- FOLLOWED WHAT WE HAD ALL AGREED TO AND RECOMMENDED, AND, AGAIN, THIS TIME AROUND, WE INCLUDED AN ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITY FOR PUBLIC FEEDBACK WITH THE SURVEY. BUT I THINK, YOU KNOW, AGAIN, JUST IF WE ARE TO BRING CK THE CANDIDATES, I THINK IT'S CLEAR FROM ALL OF THE DATA THAT WE HAVE, AND WE HAVE PROVIDED A LOT OF DATA AND FEEDBACK THAT, THERE ARE TWO THAT STAND OUT FROM THE CROWD. THANK YOU.
00:58:19.790: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
00:58:21.692: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRAND:  THANK YOU. HAVE GO ATHER REMINDER OVER EMAIL, BUT IT WAS ON THE TIP OF MY TONGUE, SO, THANK YOU. WE -- PART OF THIS PROCESS, ONE OF OUR OPTIONS, AND IT WAS A CLEAR OPTION, AND IT WAS THE OPTION THAT MS. CELL RECOMMENDED, WAS TO BRING BACK ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. EN, I REMEMR AT MS. PAVLOCHEK'S INTERVIEW, FOR EXAMPLE, SHE ALLUDED TO THE FACT THAT SHE HOPED TO CONTINUE WITH THE PROCESS, MEANING TO ME THAT IT WAS HER UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS WAS JUST -- BECAUSE IT WAS ONLY A 45-MINUTE INTERVIEW, THAT SHE WAS HOPING TO COME BACK TO SHARE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND TO INTERACT FURTHER WITH THE COMMUNITY. SO,O PRETEND THAT THIS PROCESS WAS ALWAYS GOING TO BE JUST VOTE ON ONE, YOU KNOW, I THINK WE HAVE HEARD SOME OTHER THEORIES ABOUT WHY SOMEONE MIGHT BELIEVE THAT THAT'S THE CASE. THIS IS -- THIS IS GIVING -- A 45-MINUTE INTERVIEW LEFT ME WANTING TO REALLYNO FM EACH OFHOSE CANDIDATES WHAT THEIR VISION FOR OUR CY WAS, AND I -- YOU KNOW, I JUST DON'T THINK WE COULD ASCERTAIN WHAT THAT IS FROM A 45-MINUTE INTERVIEW, AND WE HEARD THAT ACROSS ALL THREE PANELS. IT WASN'T JUST ME OR A COUPLE OF OTHER COUNCILMEMBERS ASKING FOR THAT. WE HEARD THAT FROM STAFF, AND WE HEARD THAT FROM MEMBS OF THE COMMUNITY PANEL, AND WE HEARD IT FROM RESIDENTS. SO, I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THE HARM IS. TO ME, IF IT'S TWO, IF IT'S FOUR -- IF IT'S FOUR, THEY CAN -- ANY OF THOSE FOUR CAN DECIDE TO COME BACK AND PARTICIPATE IN THE PROCESS OR NOT. THAT'S TOTALLY UP TO THEM. SO, SO I'M TOTALLY COMFORTABLE EXTENDING INVITATIONS TO FOUR, AND THEYAN DECEHETHER OR NOT THEY WANT TO PARTICIPATE. BUT, YOU KNOW, TO NOT UNDERSTAND DURING THIS CRITICAL TIME WHAT SOMEONE'S VISION IS FOR THE CITY I THINK DOES A DISSERVICE TO OUR RESIDENTS, AND TO NOT HAVE ALL OF US UNITED BEHIND A CANDIDATE, KNOWING -- AND I'M NOT SAYING IT ISN'T THIS GROUP'S JOB TOAKE THIS DECISION, BUT KNOWING THAT A FUTURE COUNCIL THAT'S GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF TURNOVER IS GOING TO BE DETERMINING IF THAT CITY ADMINISTRATOR STAYS ON, AND TO NOT GET SOME FURTHER INPUT JUST SEEMS FOOLISH TO ME.
01:01:01.051: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
01:01:04.521: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  I WAS GOING TO ASK MS. CELL IF SHE HAD ANY INPUT ON THIS WHOLE MATTER. I SUPPORT THE NOTION OF INVITING ALL FOUR. I UNDERSTAND, BASED ON THE RESULTS THAT WE HAVE COLLECTED SO FAR, THAT TWO CANDIDATES SEEM TO HAVE FAREDETTE IN THIS INIAL PART OFHE PROCESS, BUT I GUESS I SUPPORT THE NOTION OF INVITING ALL FOUR, IF WE THINK SO. I THINK THE PUBLIC FEELS LIKE THEIR CONCERNS WILL BE ASSUAGED BY HAVING MORE OUTREACH. MY DECISION MAKING IS GOING TO BE -- WOULD BE -- MY DECISION MAKING WOULD BENEFIT FRO KNOWG IF IT'S ALLOWED FORE TO EITHER BY WAY OF THE RECRUITER OR OUR ACTING H.R. DIRECTOR OR SOMEBODY ELSE TO HAVE MY OWN CONVERSATIONS WITH THESE CANDIDATES. OUTSIDE OF A PUBLIC PROCESS, CAN I SEND THEM AN EMAIL? HE'S SOME QSTNS THAT I HAVE. I KNOW WHAT'S UNLAWFUL OR LAWFUL. NOT FILTERED THROUGH THE LENS OF THE PUBLIC, BECAUSE I HAVE HAD PLENTY OF PUBLIC INPUT ALREADY, I HAVE HAD PEOPLE WHO ARE IN LEADERSHIP POSITIONS, NEIGHBORHOOD LEADERSHIP POSITIONS AND SO ON, CITY LEADER TYPES, I WOULD SAY, SAY THEY DON'T CARE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER; THEY JUST WANT SOMEBODY W IS COMPENT. THE CHARTER SAYS SOMEONE WHO HAS ADMINISTRATIVE AND MANAGEMENT AND FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY. WE HAVE THAT NOW, OF COURSE, AND THE GOOD THING IS THAT NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS WITH THIS SEARCH IS THAT WE HAVE MR. CRAWFORD ACTING NOW, AS ACTING ADMINISTRATOR, AND IF THE OFFER ENDS UP GOING TO SOMEBODY ELSE, WE ARE CERTAINLY IN GOOD HANDS WITH HIM CK INUR FINANCES DEPARTMENT. I HAVE ALWAYS LOOKED UP TO HIM AND ADMIRED HIM FOR HIS ACUMEN THERE. SO I THINK WE ARE IN A WINNING SITUATION HERE. I JUST WONDERED IF YOU HAD ANY INPUT ABOUT HOW WOULD INDIVIDUAL COUNCILMEMBERS GO ABOUT LEARNING MORE THAN WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED ALREADY FROM THIS FILTERED INPUT.
01:03:07.711: >> MAYOR TAYLOR: MS. CELL?
01:03:11.348: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  THANK YOU.
01:03:12.349: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU.
01:03:12.983: >> MY GOAL IN THIS PROCESS IS TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ALL AS COUNCILMEMBERS HAVE THE INFORMATION THAT YOU NEED TO FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH THE DECISION. WITH THE MEET AND GREET THAT I HAVE LAID OUT, AND I WOULD WANT TO CONFIRM WITH COUNCIL THAT IT ONE-ON-ONE CVERSATIONS WITH COUNCIEMBER AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND STAFF IS A BENEFICIAL WAY TO GET COMFORTABLE WITH THE CANDIDATE, AS WELL AS ADDING ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AND RAISING ISSUES IN A BROAD FORUM, ARE TWO AREAS WHERE I THINK YOU COULD GET ADDITIONAL INFORMATION SPECIFIC TO THE CANDIDATES' INPUT. FOR TSE ONE-ON-ONE CONVSATIONS, I WOULD WANTO RUN BY COUNCIL TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY DON'T NEED TO B TAPED OR BROADCAST, BECAUSE I THINK THERE IS AN INTERVIEW COMPONENT THAT I WOULD WANT TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT, BUT IN THE PAST, I HAVE DONE MEET AND GREETS WHERE COUNCILMEMBERS COULD ASK CANDIDATES INDIVIDUAL QUESTIONS ONE ON ONE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY GOT COMFORTABLE WITH THAT EVENTUAL CRITICAL DECISION.
01:04:19.316: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  THANK YOU.
01:04:20.450: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, ARE YOU SATISFIED WITH THAT?
01:04:22.185: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  YEAH, THANK YOU.
01:04:24.021: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
01:04:25.689: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE ALL OF THE THOUGHTS AND CONVERSATION THAT WE ARE HAVING HERE YOU KNOW, I DO QUESTION WHETH WE LOOK -- HOW MUCH WE RELY ON THE DIVISION OF OUR CITY AND OUR COMMUNITY COME FROM THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR. THAT I BELIEVE LIES MORE WITH THE ELECTED OFFICIALS. THAT'S WHY THERE ARE ELECTIONS EVERY TWO YEARS, SO THAT WE HAVE A FRESH LOOK AT WT THE COMMUNITY DESIRES, WHERE THE COMMUNITY WANTS TO GO. THAT'S WHY THERE ARE ELECTIONS. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THESE POSITIONS. IF IT WAS JUST TO COME FROM OUR CITY ADMINISTRATOR, WE COULD ELIMINATE A LOT OF THESE POSITIONS RIGHT HERE AND JUST HAVE ONEERSON DO IT. TO ME, I DON'T -- I DON'T -- I DON'T REALLY PUT A WHOLE LOT OF VALUE IN THAT. I WANT SOMEONE WHO CAN EXECUTE THE CONSENSUS OF COUNCIL, YOU KNOW, AND THE VISION COMES FROM COUNCIL, AND COUNCIL COMES FROM THE PEOPLE, AND, YOU KNOW, WE WERE ELECTED TO LEAD. WE UNDERSTAND, HOPEFULLY, ALL OF THE DIFFERENT CHALLENGES AND THE COMPLEXITIES THAT COME WITH THE JOB BY NOW. EVERYONE HAS BEEN HERE FOR AT LEAST TWO YEARS NOW, OR GOING ON TWO YEARS, AND, YOU KNOW, I JUST THINK THAT WE CAN MAKE THIS DECISION. WE HAVE MADE ACTUALLY JUST AS DIFFICULT DECISIONS BEFORE, AND THE WHOLE PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT PROCESS, I APPRECIATE THAT BUT I DOT KNOW IF THAT'S -- YOU KNOW, THERE WAS NOTHING GLARING, LIKE STOP SIGNS AND RED FLAGS. IT HASN'T COME FORTH. YOU KNOW, I DON'T SEE ANY RED FLAGS RIGHT NOW WITH GOING FORWARD. WE WERE ELECTED TO LEAD. WE NEED LDERSHIP. WE NEED STABILITY, AND CURRENTLY, WE ARE IN FLUX RIGHT NOW, AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S GOOD FOR THE STAFF. I DON'T THINK THAT'S GOOD FOR THE COMMUNITY. I DON'T THINK THAT'S GOOD FOR THE ORGANIZATION, AND TO SIT THERE AND STRING THIS OUT FOR SOME INPUT THAT, FRANKLY, HAS A PLACE BUT IS NOT THE DRIVING FACTOR IN MAKING THIS DECISION. IT'S ONE OF MANY, BUT IT'S NOT A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THAT. IT TAKES, YOU KNOW, AS WE KNOW, ONLY SIX COUNCILMEMBERS TO DIISS A CITY ATTORNEY OR A CITY ADMISTRATOR. WE HAVE A LOT OF INFLUENCE AND POWER WHEN IT COMES TO THAT, AND IT NEEDS TO BE RESPECTED, AND IT NEEDS TO BE -- WE NEED TO BE RESPONSIBLE WITH IT. AND WE NEED TO, I THINK, KE A DESION, AND, AGAIN, JUST PUSHING BACK, THE VISION COMES FROM COUNCIL, AND I THINK THAT'S PERHAPS ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE HAD IN THE PAST, THAT THE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE WAS NOT REFLTED WITH THELECTED OFFICIS THAT A ON COUNCIL, AND SO ALL WE NEED IS SOMEBODY WHO CAN FOLLOW THE CONSENSUS OF COUNCIL.
01:08:23.226: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN?
01:08:24.761: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE VISION FOR THE COMMUNITY AND THE LOWER CASE C CITY AND THE VISN FOR T CAPITAL CITY OR CITY HALL, AND THIS IS A VERY COMPLEX ORGANIZATION, 750 EMPLOYEES, AN OPERATING BUDGET OF ALMOST $500 MILLION, RESPONSIBLE FOR OVER A BILLION DOLLARS IN ASSETS. WE ARE NOT HIRING A PROJECT MANAGER WHO IS GOING TO WORK 80 HOURS A WEEK AND BURN THE CANDLE AT BOTH ENDS AND GET US A CARBON NET ZERO STRATEGIC PLAN IN TWO WEEKS. WE ARE NOT HIRING SOMEONE WHO IS GOING TO GO OUT WITH A HAMMER AND A NAIL AND FIX THE DAM. WE ARE HIRING SOMEONE WHO IS GOING TO BE A CONDUCTOR OF A VERY LARGE ORCHESTRA AND SHOULD A VISION FOR HOW THAT ORGANIZATION CAN OPERATE IN A BETTER WAY. IT MEANSAVING AISION FOR HOW WE TEA DOW SILOS, SO DEPARTMENTS NOT TALKING TO EACH OTHER AND COORDINATING PROJECTS. THAT MEANS THAT WE NEED TO HAVE A VISION FOR HOW TO BETTER IMPROVE USEFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE, SO THAT WHEN PEOPLE SUBMIT AN ISSUE THROUGH A2 FIX IT OR COME TO OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE DESK, WHENEVER THAT'S OPEN AGAIN IN THE FUTURE THEARE ASSURED THAT THEIR PROBLEM IS GOING TO BE RESOLD AND THAT COMMUNICATION IS GOING TO BE OPEN AND TRANSPARENT WITH THEM ALONG THE WAY. ALL RIGHT, THESE ARE ELEMENTS OF AN ORGANIZATIONAL VISION, A VISION FOR THE SYSTEM, A VISION FOR CITY HALL, THAT I THINK WE WOULD ALL WELCOME, BECAUSE WE CAN SAY THAT WE WANT BETTER CUSTOMER SERVICE, AND WE CAN SAY THAT WE WANT A PLAN TOIX OUR 60-YEAR-OLD PARK INFRASTRUCTURE, BUT WE NEED SOMEONE WHO IS GOING TO GET THAT DONE AND COORDINATE THE DOZENS AND HUNDREDS OF EMPLOYEES WHO ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO EXECUTE IT. AND THAT'S THE VISION THAT WE WANT, AND I THINK MR. CRAWFORD, AFTER 14 YEARS AND CORPORATE EXPERIENCE AND AN MBA, AND, OBVIOUSLY, A SIGNIFICANT BENEFICIAL DATA AFTER OUR INITIAL INTERVIEW PROCESS, HAS A LOT OF THAT, AND NOW WE JUST NEED TO LET THE COMMUNITY KNOW, NOT ONLY AS A MEANS FOR US TO GET MORE DATA, BECAUSE WE HAVE TO MAKE A REALLY IMPORTANT DECISION, BUT ALSO AS A MEANS TO INVITE THE PUBLIC INTO WHAT DOES NICIPALGOVERNMENT, WHAT DOES IT REALLY MEAN WHEN YOU VOTE ON MILLAGES AND MILLAGE RENEWALS, WHEN YOU SEE A DUMP TRUCK WITH THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR SEAL DRIVE BY; WHAT DOES THAT TRULY MEAN, AND WHO IS GOING TO BE THE NEXT LEADER TO MAKES SURE THAT ALL OF THOSE SERVICES ARE -- SO, YEAH, I THINK THAT VISIO IS STILL AN IMPORTANT PART, BUT I AGREE THAT THE VISION FOR THE COMMUNITY HAS TO COME FROM THE ELECTED OFFICIALS.
01:11:15.899: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU. COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER, I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU PULLED YOUR HAND DID OR I DID BY ACCIDENT, AND I THOUGHT YOU WERE ON THE QUEUE NEXT, BUT WAS THAT MY DOING BY ACCIDENT?
01:11:29.045: >> I THINK THAT WAS AN ACCIDENT. MAYOR TAYLOR:  THAT YOU THINK. YOU HAVE T FLOOR.
01:11:33.183: >> OKAY. I'M UP. AS SOON AS WE ARE DONE WITH THIS AMENDMENT DISCUSSION, I WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS MY STRONG SUPPORT FOR TOM CRAWFORD, AFTER WORKING WITH HIM CLOSELY FOR THREE YEARS. BUT ON THE AMENDMENT, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HASN'T BEEN FULLY MENTIONED, OR I WOULD LIKE TO SAY AGAIN, IS THAT I FEEL THAT IT IS URGENT THAT WE WRAP UP IS PROCESS TIGHT, AND THAT'S WHY I AM NOT SUPPORTING AN AMENDMENT TO DEFER FURTHER FOR ADDITIONAL DATA. WE ARE HAVING, YOU KNOW, AS WE ALL KNOW, A COVID-19 CRISIS, AND WE NEED TO MOVE ON QUICKLY AND WE ALSO NEED TO HIRE AN H.R. D DIRECTOR AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. THAT'S BEEN A GAPING PROBLEM, AND WE NEED TO -- THAT IS A MORE URGENT PROBLEM THAN GATHERING EVEN FURTHER DATA. THAT COUNCIL HASONE R DUFIDENT DILIGENCE. THIS HAS BEEN A GOOD PROCESS. WE HAVE BECOME FAMILIAR WITH THE CANDIDATES, AND THIS IS COUNCIL'S RESPONSIBILITY. THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR IS ONE OF TWO EMPLOYEES THAT REPORT DIRECTLY TO US, THAT WE SELECT, AND, AGAIN, I WL BEUPPORTING TOM CRAWFORD, AND I FEEL THAT -- I URGE MY COLLEAGUES THAT WE WRAP THIS UP TONIGHT AND GET BACK TO OR ON TO MUCH MORE URGENT MATTERS FACING THE CITY. THANK YO
01:13:20.156: >> MAYORAYLOR:  WHAVE GOT COUNCILMEMBER NEON.
01:13:21.257: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  THANK YOU. I JUST WANT TO ECHO SOME OF COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI'S POINTS IN TERMS OF THE MEANING OF THIS INPUT. I HAVE HAD A NUMBER OF CONVERSATIONS THE LAST FEW DAYS WITH COMMUNITY LEADERS, WHO LIKE JEFF, I GUESS COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, MENTIONED THIS AS WELL, COMMUNITY LEADERS WHO HAVE HAD DIRECT EXPERIENCE OVER THE COURSE OF YEARS WITHAST CITY ADMINISTRATORS AND HAVE BEEN VERY INTERESTED IN UNDERSTANDING HOW THIS DECISION WOULD MOVE FORWARD, AND IT IS -- RELATIVE TO THE WHOLE POPULATION OF OUR CITY, IT IS A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO TRULY UNDERSTAND HOW THIS ROLE FUNCTIONS, HOW THIS ROLE INTERFACES WITH COUNCIL AND THE OBLIGATION TO REFLECT THE CONSENSUS OF COUNCIL. AND WHEN I HEAR THE DISCUSSION AROUNDISION AND HAVING ONE-ON-ONE CONVERSATIONS, FRANKLY, I DON'T NEED TO HAVE A ONE-ON-ONE CONVERSATION WITH ANY OF THE CANDIDATES. MANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC ARE NOT AWARE, MOST MEMBERS OF TH PUBLIC ARE NOT AWARE OF THE HUGE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION THAT WE WERE PROVIDED ABOUT THESE CANDIDATES, AND IN THE DISCUSSIONS THAT I HAVHAD WITH COMMUNITYEARS WHO HE A LOT SKIN IN THE GAME, W WOULD LOOK FORWARD TO DIRECT WORK WITH OUR FUTURE CITY ADMINISTRATOR, THEY HAVE NOT RAISED CONCERNS TO ME ABOUT A LACK OF INFORMATION GOING IN, AND TO ME, THAT IS MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN ANYTHING ELSE. THE CONCERNS THAT I HAVE HEARD ARE A REPETITION OF PAST MISTAKES, OF POLITICAL PEOPLE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE INDIVIDUAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH COUNCILMEMBERS VERSUS THE RESPONSIBILITY TO REFLECT THE CONSENSUS OF THE WHOLE BODY, AND THAT'S WHERE I AM SEEING LOTS OF RED FLAGS, WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT, YOU KNOW, THE -- UNDERSTANDING THE INDIVIDUAL VISI OFHE PERSONND HAVING INDIVIDUAL ONE-ON-ONES. THERE IS A HUGE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION AVAILABLE, EVEN PUBLICLY, ABOUT THESE CANDIDATES, AND I HAVE YET TO RECEIVE AN EMAIL FROM SOMEONE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE FLIMSINESS OF THIS PROCESS, WHO HAS EVEN OFFERED, YOU KNOW, I READ THIS ARTICLE ABOUT THIS CANDIDATE. YOU CAN EVEN GOOGLE THESE CANDIDATES AND LEARN QUITE A LOT ABOUT THEM. AND I GUESS THE OTHER POINT THAT I WOULD MAKE IS FOR EVERY EMAIL THAT IOT COMPLNING ABOUT THIS PROSS BEING TOO SHORT, I DON'T KNOW THAT I GOT AN EMAIL -- I THINK FOR EVERY FOUR EMAILS I GOT COMPLAINING ABOUT THE PROCESS BEING TOO SHORT, I GOT ONE EMAIL FROM SOMEBODY WHO ACTUALLY DID A LITTLE BIT OF RESEARCH AND SAID, YOU KNOW, I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THIS CANDIDATE. YOU KN, I YR REESTATIVE. UNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI IS YOUR REPRESENTATIVE. WE ARE YOUR REPRESENTATIVES IN MAKING THIS VOT YOU DON'T HAVE TO PARTICIPATE IN A POLL. YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO PUBLIC INPUT ON A SURVEY. YOU CAN ACTUALLY EXPRESS YOUR OPINIONS TO US, INSTEAD OF SUGGESTING THAT THE WHOLE PROCESS BE TURNED UPSIDE DOWN. AGAIN, I GUESS I -- I KNOW THAT I'M GOING TO BE ACCUSED OF SULTINTHE PUBLICR SMISSING THE PUBC, BUT THERE IS -- THERE IS A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN OUR TOWN WHO ARE GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF SKIN IN THE GAME, IN TERMS OF WHO WE CHOOSE. THE AVERAGE PERSON ON THE STREET DOES NOT HAVE A LOT OF SKIN IN THE GAME, IN TERMS OF WHO WE CHOOSE, AMONG THIS PARTICULAR POOL. WE HAVE FOUR VERY EXCELLENT CANDIDATES. I HAVE NOT HEARD ANYONE SAY THAT WOD BE AOLUTEL RRIBLE. THERE'S NOT A HE RISK OF ANYTHING I'M READY TO MOVE FORWARD TONIGHT, AND I REALLY AM JUST TIRED OF GAMES THAT WE SEEM TO BE PLAYING, PRETENDING THAT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION, PRETENDING THAT PUBLIC INPUT IS GOING TO BE DECISIVE, PRETENDING THAT -- I MEAN, I JUST FEEL LIKE THERE'S A WHOLE LOT OF PRETENDING GOING ON TONIGHT. THANKS. MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER GRD.
01:17:00.143: >>OUNCILMEMBER GRAND:  THANK YOU. COUNCILMEMBER NELSON, LET ME SPEAK CLEARLY, THEN. THERE WAS NOT ALIGNMENT IN THIS DATA BETWEEN STAFF AND COUNCIL AND THE COMMUNITY, AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT WHO IS GOING TO LEAD THIS ORGANIZATION, AND WHEN I MEAN VISION, I MEAN STRATIC PLAN I MEAN WHOS GNG TO MOTIVATE STAFF TO IMPLEMT THE POLICIES THAT WE AS A COUNCIL WANT TO SEE THEM IMPLEMENT, BECAUSE IF WE DON'T HAVE A STRONG LEADER AT THE TOP, IF WE DON'T HAVE CONSENSUS AND BEING BEHIND THAT PERSON, IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT POLICIES WE TRY TO GET THEM TO ENACT; THEY WILL FAIL. D WHEN W DON'T HR STRONG CONSENSUS FROM OUR STAFF, BUT WHAT WE DO HEAR IS AN ASK FROM STAFF TO BRING PEOPLE FORWARD FOR MORE INFORMATION, SO THAT THEY CAN HELP US MAKE A MORE INFORMED DECISION ABOUT WHO IS GOING TO LEAD THEM, WHO IS GOING TO MOTIVATE THEM, IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY AS COUNCILMEMBERS TO LISTEN TO THAT FEEDBACK. IT'S NOT JUST FRO THE COMMUNIT ITS SO FROM E STAFF WHO RUN THIS ORGANIZATION, AND I THINK IT IS CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF WHOEVER LEADS THIS ORGANIZATION AS THE ADMINISTRATOR THAT THERE IS CONSENSUS AT THE COUNCIL LEVEL, BECAUSE IN A FEW MONTHS, WE CAN ELECT -- WE CAN SIGN A CONTRACT. YOU CAN PUSH IT FORWARD TONIGHT. YOU CAN REFUSE TISTEO TH ANREFUSE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. FINE. WE KNOW THERE WAS A PLAN. WE HEARD IT. RIGHT? AND IT WAS A BIG PUSH. LET'S BE HONEST. IT WAS A BIG PUSH TO EVEN GET A SEARCH, BECAUSE IF SOME OF YOU HAD YOUR WAY, THERE NEVER WOULD HAVE BEEN ONE IN THE FIRST PLACE. SO LET'S NOT PLAY GAMES, AND LET'S  HONEST ABO THIS A T OF YOU DON'T CARE WHAT ANYONE THINKS. YOU WANTED TO SELECT YOUR GUY AND MOVE IT FORWARD. NOW, I HAPPEN TO REALLY LIKE THAT GUY, AND I THINK IT DOES HIM A DISSERVICE TO NOT GO THROUGH WITH THE PROCESS AND GET THE INFORMATION THAT WE NEED SO THAT EVERYONE IS BEHIND THE PERSON TO HELP MOVE OUR CITY FORWARD FOR THE LONG TERM. THAT IS WHAT WE ARE ASKING FOR. IT'S NOT PLAYING GAMES. I TAKE THIS DECISION REALLY SERIOUSLY.
01:19:16.345: >> CAN WE --
01:19:19.482: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRAND:  BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO BE HERE -- NO, JEFF, YOU CAN DEAL WITH IT. THAT'S YOUR LANGUAGE. SOME OF US ARE STILL GOING TO BE HERE AT THIS TABLE AND HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT, RIGHT, AND WANT TO ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OUR CITY AND THINK THAT WE NEED A LITTLE MORE TIME TO PUSH THESE CANDIDATES TO EXPLAIN HOW THEY ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO MOVE OUR CITY FORWARD IN THIS REALLY CRITICAL TIME. THAT'S WHAT WE ARE ASKING FOR, BUT IF YOU BELIEVE, JUST LIKE YOU DID IN THE PAST, THAT YOU CAN LOOK OUTSIDE OF THE SYSTEM WITH MORE THAN FIVE PEOPLE AND MAKE DECISIONS, BECAUSE YOU DON'T NT TO WORK TO GET THE WORK DONE, FINE.
01:20:00.289: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, I THINK YOU'VE SPOKEN TWICE ON THIS MATTER.
01:20:05.261: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  YEAH, CAN WE SPOKE TO THE MOTIONS BEFORE US?
01:20:11.233: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRAND:  I'M A HUNDD RCT SPKING TO THE AMENENTS. COUNCILMEMB HAYNER:  WE ARE SPEAKING TO TWO VERSUS FOUR, THE AMENDMENT TO THE AMENDMENT?
01:20:19.375: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  WE ARE.
01:20:20.943: >> I HAVE A QUESTION. I HAVE SPOKEN TWICE. I HAVE A QUESTION.
01:20:25.581: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  YES.
01:20:26.082: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  IF IT'S FOR MS. CELL. THIS HAS TO DO WITH COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE ABOUT ONE-ON-ONE INTERVIEWS BETWEEN, I DON'T KNOW, INDIVIDUALS, MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY OR COUILMEMBERS. IS THAT WHAT WOULD BE CONTEMPLATED, AND I'LL JUST PREFACE THIS BY SAYING, SO THIS MAY BE A BIT MORE RHETORICAL, A BIT OF A SOFTBALL QUESTION, BUT THE CITY HAD A BAD EXPERIENCE WITH A PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATOR SEARCH MANY YEARS AGO, WHERE ONE CANDIDATE -- THERE WAS ONE COUNCILMEMBER WHO HAD A ONE-ON-ONE, AND NO ONE ELSE WAS PRESENT, AND THEN UNFORTUNATE ACCUSATIONS WERE MADE ABOUT THIS ONE INDIVIDUAL, BUT THERE WAS NO WAY TO VERIFY THAT. AND I REALLY SORT  TORPEDOED, THE PROCESS IN MANY WAYS, BUT I WOULD, FROM THAT EXPERIENCE, I DON'T THINK IT'S IN ANYONE'S INTEREST TO HAVE ONE-ON-ONES WHERE THERE'S NO ONE WATCHING, IF YOU WILL. SO I DON'T KNOW -- SO MY QUESTION TO YOU IS WHAT IS THE PROFESSIONAL PROCEDURE FOR CONDUCTING THOSE KINDS OF FURTHER INTEIEWS.
01:21:46.662: >> THANK YOU. GREAT QUESTION. THE KIND OF PROPOSAL THAT I HAD SUGGESTED AS A NEXT STEP WAS TO HAVE A VARIETY OF ELEMENTS TO PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION. ONOF THOSE ELENTS WOULD B A KIND OF FORMAL PRESENTATION WHERE QUESTIONS WERE PROVIDED IN ADVANCE, AS WELL AS A FEW PROMPTS WITH KIND OF A VISION FOR CITY HALL. ANOTHER ELEMENT WAS KIND OF ONE-ON-ONE MEETINGS THAT WOULD BE COVID FRIENDLY, SO IN THE PAST, WHEN I HAVE DONE COMMUNITY RECEPTIONS, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE COULD GATHER IN THIS SMALL GROUPS. THERE WOULD BE AN OPPORTUNITY IN PUIC FORUM, VISLE FORUM, WHERE PEOPLE COULD ASK QUESTIONS THAT MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT MORE PERSONAL TO ONE PERSON, BUT TO, AGAIN, GIVE EVERYONE THAT COMFORT. SO MY THOUGHT, TO MAKE IT COVID FRIENDLY, WAS THAT THERE WOULD BE KIND OF A QUEUE, IT WOULD BE BY APPOINTMENT, BUT IT WOULD BE OUTSIDE, MAYBE UNDERTENT, WHERE IT WOULD BE VISIBLE, BECAUSE WE'D BE MONITORING IT. THERE WOULDN'T BE ANYBODY WITHIN SIX FEET. THERE WOULD BE -- THE NEXT PERSON WOULD BE ABLE TO OVERHEAR THE CONVERSATION. IT'S NOT MEANT TO MAKE IT SECRETIVE, BUT IT'S MEANT TO ALLOW ONE-ON-ONE INTERACTION SO THAT KEY PEOPLE, STAFF,COUNCI CAN ASK ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS IN A SESSION. IT WOULDN'T BE PRIVATE AND SECRETIVE. IT WOULD BE PUBLIC IN THE SENSE THAT OTHER PEOPLE COULD SEE IT, BUT IT WOULD ALLOW FOR SOME ADDITIONAL COMMUNICATION AND INTERFACE. ANOTHER KEY COMPONENT THAT I HAD IDENTIFIED WAS TOURS, BECAUSE, AGAI GETTING STAFF TO BE COMFORTABLE WITH THE CANDIDATES FOR CANDIDATES TO BECOME MORE FAMILIAR WITH MUNICIPAL OPERATIONS WAS ANOTHER COMPONENT, SO STAFF AND SMALL GROUPS WOULD BE ABLE TO PROVIDE TOURS, TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INTERACTION, SO THAT WAS WHAT I HAD SUGGESD, WAS WAY TGET EVERYBODY MORE FAMILIAR WITH EACH OTHER IN THIS ADDITIONAL ROLE, IF COUNCIL FEELS THAT GETTING INFORMATION WOULD BE BENEFICIAL TO THIS PROCESS. THANK YOU.
01:24:02.531: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER SMITH?
01:24:05.601: >> COUNCILMEMBER SMITH:  YEAH, THANK YOU. I'LL BE BRIEF. I LIKE THE IDEA OF HAVING EITHER SMALL GROUPS OR ONE-ON-ONE QUESTION/ANSWERS. I RESPONDED AS I DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION. I HIRE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN MY DAY JOB, AND I HAVE NEVER HIRED AN IMPORTANT POSITION BASED ON A 45-MINUTE INTERVIEW. I JUST DON'T GET -- I DON'T -- I THINK THERE'S A LOT MORE TO LEARN FROM SOMEBODY'S PERSALIT THAN WHAT COMES ACROSS IN THEIR RESUMÉ OR IN A VIDEO. YOU KNOW, YOU NEED TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE PERSON, AND YOU NEED TO GET A FEELING FOR WHO THEY ARE, AND THE FORUM THAT WE HAD SET UP DIDN'T GIVE ME THAT OPPORTUNITY, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY -- AND I APPRECIATE THAT WE HAVE NEVER DONE SURVEYS ON THIS PROCESS, BUT WE HAD 59 PEOPLE WEIGH IN. YOU KNOW, THAT NOT VERY NY PEOP. THAT, TOE, IS SUCH A MINOR INCORPORATION OF PUBLIC SENTIMENT THAT, YOU KNOW, I JUST CAN'T GET BEHIND IT. BUT I WOULD SUGGEST, AT THIS POINT, MOST OF OUR MINDS ARE MADE UP. CAN WE VOTE ON THIS?
01:25:18.874: >> MAYOR TLOR:  RTHER DISCUSSION? I GUESS I'M THE -- ON THE QUESTION OF TWO TO FOUR, I'M CONTENT MOVING FORWARD WITH FOUR, IF THAT'S COUNCIL'S WILL. I WOULD SAY, HOWEVER, I'M GOING TO PUSH BACK ON THE QUESTION AS TO WHETHER THIS IS A REVISION OF THE PROCESS. THIS SECOND STEP WAS SPECIFICALLY CONTEMPLATED IN THE COUNCIL RESOLUTION O AUGUST , IN WHICH WE SPECIFICALLY SAID THAT AT THIS MEETING, AFTER RECEIVING FEEDBACK, WE'LL DETERMINE NEXT STEPS, WHICH MAY INCLUDE NEGOTIATING WITH ONE FINALIST, INVITING MULTIPLE FINALISTS FOR ADDITIONAL INTERVIEWS IN SEPTEMBER, OR RE-LAUNCHING A SEARCH. THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ABOUT THIS CONVERSATION WHICH IS CHANGING THE RULES OF THE GAME, CHANGING THE PROCESS OF THE GAME MID-FIELD -- MID-STREAM. THIS IS ENTIRELY CONSISTENT. THIS IS THE ROAD TO UNANIMITY. THIS IS THE ROAD TO CONSENSUS. AND I'M JUST LOOKING FOR MY COLLEAGUES TO RECOGNIZE THAT AND MOVE FORWARD ON THAT BASIS. COUNCILMEMBER EATON?
01:26:27.443: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON THANK YOU. SO I WANT TO BE CLEAR, FOLLOWING UP ON THE MAYOR'S COMMENTS, IS THIS AMENDMENT PROPOSING THAT WE OPEN IT UP FOR PUBLIC INPUT? OR IS THIS AN EFFORT TO BRING IT BACK JUST TO COUNCIL SO THAT WE CAN ASK MORE QUESTIONS? BECAUS I'M CLEAR ON THAT, AFTER WH THEAYOR JUST SAID. SECONDLY, I DON'T BELIEVE THAT IT'S FAIR TO THE CANDIDATES IF WE BRING ALL FOUR BACK. I THINK THAT THE PREVIOUS STEPS HAVE CLEARLY SEPARATED TWO CANDIDATES FROM THE OTHER TWO, AND IT WOULD JUST BE UNFAIR TO THOSE OER TWO CANDIDATES TO INCLUDE THEM INNOTHER WAVE OF INTERVIEWS OR WHATEVER THE HECK YOU HAVE IN MIND HERE, IF IN FACT IT'S UNLIKELY THAT THEY ARE GOING TO MAKE THE CUT. SO, I'M GOING TO VOTE AGAINST INCREASING IT TO FOUR, BUT I REALLY WOULD LIKE A CLEARER IDEA OF WHAT IT IS THAT YOU'RE PROPOSING, WHEERE ARE GOI TO JT OPEN IT UP TO THE PUBLIC TO COMMENT ON THIS IN WAYS THAT WE DIDN'T DO THE LAST TIME WE DID A CITY ADMINISTRATOR SEARCH OR WHETHER THEY ARE COMING BACK SO THAT WE CAN ASK MORE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU.
01:27:48.690: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE AMENDMENT TO THE AMENDMENT? I GUS BY W OF RESPONSE, ON THE SUBSTANCE, I WOULD BE LOOKING TO MS. CELL FOR THE -- FOR DIRECTION WITH RESPECT TO THE CONTENT AND FORM OF THAT INTERVIEW, OF THE SECOND INTERVIEW PROCESS. I WOULD VIEW IT AS IMPORTANT THAT THERE WAS ADDITIONAL STAFF I WOULDIEW IT IORTANT THAT THERE WAS ADDITIONAL PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT, AND, OF COURSE, YOU KNOW, THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH ADDITIONAL COUNCIL ENGAGEMENT. YOU KNOW, I THINK IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR CANDIDATES TO SEE MORE OF US AND FOR ALL OF US HERE, STAFF MEMBERS AT CITY LL AND T PUBLIC TO SEE MORE OF THEM. FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE AMENDMENT? PARDON ME, THE AMENDMENT TO THE AMENDMENT. MR. GERHART, WHO IS POINT TODAY?
01:28:45.914: >> HOLLY. -- RAMLAWI.
01:28:58.060: >> MAY TAYLO  DIYOU SAY RAMLAWI? RRY. STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, AND FOR CLARITY, WHAT WE ARE VOTING ON IS MOVING IT FROM TWO PERSONS TO FOUR PERSONS.
01:29:08.904: >> CITY CLERK:  COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
01:29:09.738: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  YES.
01:29:10.372: >> CITY CLERK:  COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
01:29:11.206: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  YES.
01:29:12.474: >> CITY CLERK:  COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER?
01:29:13.342: >> COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER:  NO.
01:29:16.144: >> CITY CLERK:  COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD?
01:29:18.213: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD:  NO.
01:29:18.847: >> CITY ERK:  COUNCILMBER LUMM?
01:29:19.648: >>OUNCILMEMB LUMM:  NO.
01:29:21.216: >> CITY CLERK:  COUNCILMEMBER GRAND?
01:29:22.751: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRAND:  YES.
01:29:25.220: >> CITY CLERK:  COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN?
01:29:26.088: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN: YES.
01:29:30.325: >> CITY CLERK:  MAYOR TAYLOR?
01:29:30.926: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  YES.
01:29:31.426: >> CITY CLERK:  COUNCILMEMBER EATON?
01:29:32.227: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  NO.
01:29:33.729: >> CITY CLERK:  COUNCILMEMBER NELSON?
01:29:34.563: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  NO.
01:29:36.031: >> CITY CLERK:  COUNCILMEMBER SMITH?
01:29:37.299: >> COUNCILMEMBER SMITH:  YES.
01:29:39.301: >> CITY CLERK:  THE AMENDMENT DISCSI OF THE AMENDMENT AS AMENDED? I HAD -- COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, I SEE YOU HAVE RAISED YOUR HAND. I HAD FROM BACK WHEN ON THE QUEUE COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN, WE HAVBE AT THISONGNOUGH AT WITH THEIR ACQUIESCE SENSE, I'LL ASK TO HAVE A NEW QUEUE.
01:30:13.869: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN:  IF I COULD JUST BRIEFLY?
01:30:16.638: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN?
01:30:18.507: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN:  I MOVED THE AMENDMENT FROM TWO TO FOUR BASED ON FEEDBACK FROM THIS VERY GROUP, SO I WOULD HOPE THAT WE COULD MOVE FORWARD WIT A BLIC AND DRAWS OUT MORE DIINCT VISION FOR CITY HALL FROM THE CANDIDATES.
01:30:31.887: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
01:30:34.122: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER: THANKS. I HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION FOR MS. CELL. IT'S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE, IS IT NOT, THAT WHEN INVITATIONS ARE EXTENDED TO THESE CANDIDATES, ALL FO MAY OMAY NOT COSE TO PARTIPATE MOVINGORWARD? I KNOW WE HAVE OPENED IT UP TO THESE FOUR, BUT IS IT ENTIRELY POSSIBLE, IN YOUR EXPERIENCE, AS WAS MENTIONED BY ONE OF MY COUNCIL COLLEAGUES, THEY MIGHT SAY, HEY, I GET IT; I SAW THE DATA THAT'S BEING RELEASED, OR WHATEVER, AND THEY MIGHT NOT COME BACK?
01:31:03.518: >> THAT'S DEFINITELY A POSSIBILITY.
01:31:05.754: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  OKAY. WELL, I CERTAINLY DON'T HAVE ANY -- I MEAN, I THINK IT'S -- LIKE I SAID BEFORE, IT'S DECENT TO GET FEEDBACK. I'M INTERESTED IN HOW WE ARE GOING TO GET THAT FEEDBACK. WE HAVE, WHAT, 745 STAFF MEMBERS, SOMETHING LIKE THAT? 743 AT LAST COUNT? WE GOT 1RESPONSE IS THAT CORRECT? AND SO THAT'S LESS THAN -- THAT'S LESS THAN TWO 1-HUNDREDTHS OF A PERCENT. HOW ARE WE GOING TO IMPROVE THAT STAFF FEEDBACK LOOP OVE THE NEXT TWO WEEKS, THAT SOME  MY COLLEAGU HAVE RECOMMENDED IS CRITICAL? DO YOU HAVE ANY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THAT MS. CELL?
01:31:58.106: >> I THINK SMALL GROUP DISCUSSIONS ON THE TOUR COULD BE HELPFUL. I WAS SURPRISED BY THE LOW TURNOUT RATE, AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IF I COULD FIGURE OUT SOME WAY TO INCREASE THAT.
01:32:10.886: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  OKAY. I THINK THAT'S CRITICAL. THAT DID HAVE THE LOWEST -- I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY, NOT -- YOU KNOW, 115,000 PEOPLE IN THE CITY AND 59 PUBLIC RESPONSES, I KNOW THAT'S VERY LOW TOO. I JUST -- I'M NOT -- I'M NOT SURE HOW WE ARE GOING TO INCREASE IT, AND I AGREE THAT THERE ARE -- I AM NOT SURE WHAT WAS MEANT BY NONALIGNMENT IN THE DATA, IF WHAT YOU'RE SAYING -- IF WHAT COUNCILMEMBER GRAND IS SAYINGAS THAT THEWERE AT DIFFERENT CHOICES FOR DIFFERENT GROUPS OF PEOPLE WHO SEEM TO HAVE [ OFF MIC ] -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY ABOUT THAT. THEY WERE ALL, EXCEPT FOR TEN OUT OF THE 11, THE OTHER TWO WERE VERY LOW TURNOUT, SO I AM NOT SURE IF THAT'S EVEN BEYOND THE STATISTICAL ANOMALIES, YOU KNOW, IN THE SURVEYS. SO, I- THERE'S NOTHINGRONG WITH HAVING MORE TIME. I AM NOT SURE I WOULD -- YOU KNOW, IN MY YEARS OF HIRING AND SADLY SOMETIMES FIRING PEOPLE ALSO, IT IS EXTRAORDINARILY DIFFICULT NOT ONLY TO COMB THROUGH THE 250 SOME ODD APPLICATIONS THAT MS. CELL GOT, SO WE APPRECIATE THAT BUT I CAN'T -- IAN'TEMEMBER EVER HIRING SOMEBODY WITHOUT SITTING DOWN WITH THEM FOR AN HOUR AT LEAST AND HAVING MY COWORKERS AND COLLEAGUES AND MANAGERS AND OTHER PEOPLE IN THE CORPORATION DO THE SAME, AND SO I CERTAINLY GET WHERE WE ARE COMING FROM WITH THIS. I APPRECIATE THE NOTION THAT WE HAVE A LITTLE MORE, AND THAT THAT LITTLE MORE HAS DATES PUT ON IT, BECAUSE AS WE -- THIS ISN'T -- I'M CFORTLEITH . CRAWRD IN HIS ACTING ROLE AS ALWAYS, BUT I DON'T WANT TO PUT THIS OFF FOREVER, JUST LIKE WE HAVE DONE WITH THE H.R. DIRECTOR. I THINK THAT'S NEXT AND IT MAYBE SHOULD HAVE BEEN FIRST. THAT'S MY ONLY COMMENTS. THANK YOU.
01:33:54.923: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
01:33:57.425: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  JUST A QUICK COMMENT TO NOTE THAT, BECAUSE COMNT ARE BEING MADE ABOUT THE STAFF ANALYSIS, AND THERE IS ALSO A DIFFERENCE, A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE RATINGS THAT WERE IN THE STAFF SURVEY RESPONSES VERSUS THE INTERVIEWER RATINGS AND RESPONSES. I FIND THE INTERVIEWER RATINGS, I DON'T KNOW, MORE VALUABLE, FRANKLY, AND THINK THAT THAS NOT AN INSIGNIFICANT ASPECT TO THESE RATINGS, AND ALSO I FIND THAT VERY INFLUENTIAL, AND, AGAIN, I THINK THAT IT IS -- I AGREE WITH COUNCILMEMBER EATON THAT, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE THERE WAS SUC A BIFURCATI AMONGST THE TOP TWO AND THE LOWER TWO, THAT IT WOULD BE MISLEADING [ OFF MIC ] BRING THEM ALL BACK, AND SAY WE DID GET QUITE A BIT CONSISNCY IN THE BURCATED RESULT FROM THE SURVEYS, THE INTERVIEWS, AND THE PANEL, ALL THREE PANELS. THANK YOU.
01:35:16.004: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER EATON?
01:35:18.240: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  THANK YOU. I WAS OPPOSED TO ASKING ALL FOUR CANDIDATES BACK, BUT I THINK THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT WE DO IS THAT WE REACH A UNANIMOUS AGREEMENT ON WHO T HIRE, AND SO I'LL BE SUPPORTING THIS AMENDMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY HERE AT COUNCIL IS COMFORTABLE WITH THE PROCESS AND FEELS FULLY INFORMED, AND THE TIMELINE THAT THE MAYOR HAS OFFERED IS NOT SO PROLONGED AS TO CAUSENY HARM TO T ORGANITION. I THINK WE OWE IT TO WHOEVER WE HIRE THAT WE UNANIMOUSLY SUPPORT THEIR HIRING, AND SO I'LL BE VOTING IN FAVOR OF THIS AMENDMENT.
01:36:07.289: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
01:36:09.124: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  THANK YOU, MAYOR. YOU KNOW, I HAVE HIRED HUNDREDS PEOPLE AND FIR PROBABLY JU AS MANY, MAYBE HALF AS MANY. IT GOES WITH PART OF THE JOB. I PROBABLY WOULD REDUCE THAT NUMBER QUITE A BIT, LESS THAN 20%. I APOLOGIZE, BUT I'M TRYING TO MAKE A STATEMENT HERE THAT IT'S JUST -- ISN UGLYORLD WHEN YOU' IN MANAGEMENT. IT'S A DIFFICULT DECISION. IT'S A POSITION THAT MOST PEOPLE AVOID, ACTUALLY. THEY DON'T LIKE TO BE IN THAT CHAIR. IT IS A VERY STRESSFUL CHAIR AND MOST OFTEN THANKLESS. YOU DON'T GET PAID MUCH MORE THAN YOUR COUNTERPARTS WHO DON'T HAVE THAT EXTRRESPONSIBITY. YOU DO IT FOR OTHER REASONS, AND SO, ANYHOW, I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT, AS COUNCILMEMBER EATON HAS SAID, THAT WE HAVE CONSENSUS HERE, AND I WAS PREPARED TO VOTE ON SELECTING ONE PERSON TONIGHT, AND BUT I INK IN ORD TO GIVE THAT PERSON THE SUPRT THAT THEY NEED TO DO THEIR JOB, IT'S GOOD TO HAVE THE CONSENSUS OF ALL COUNCIL, AND IF THIS EXTRA FEW WEEKS GIVES MEMBERS OF THIS BODY MORE COMFORT IN MAKING THAT DECISION, THEN I'M OKAY WITH THAT. I -- TO BE HONEST, I DO TAKE IN WHAT STAFF HAS SAID, BUT THAT'S ONLY A PART OF MY DECISION. MY DECISION WILL NOT REST AND LIE WITHHOLEHETEDLY ON WHAT STAFF SAYS. IT ONLY IS A PART OF WHAT GOES INTO THE DECISION, BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE THE DRIVING FORCE IN WHAT I FEEL IS BEST FOR THE COMMUNITY AND WHAT'S BEST FOR THE ORGANIZATION. BUT I THINK WHAT IS BEST FOR THE ORGANIZATION AND WHAT IS BEST FOR THE COMMUNITY IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE SOME HARMONY WHEN IT COMES TO SELECTI THA RSON, A IHINK THAT'S REAL IMPORTANT, AND IF WAITING AN ADDITIONAL THREE WEEKS WILL PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT AND HARMONY TO GIVE THAT PERSON THE ROOM TO OPERATE AND THE CONFIDENCE AND THE COMFORT, THEN I CAN SUPPORT IT.
01:38:46.281: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER GRISLD?
01:38:49.217: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD:  IN ANALYZING THE DATA AND LOOKING AT WHO WAS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, I THINK THAT ONE CANDIDATE STANDS OUT, BUT IN THE NAME OF WORKING WITH OTHER PEOPLE, I WILL SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION BUT I K TWO THIN: NE IS TH WE RECEIVE NOTIFICAON, 48 HOURS IN ADVANCE, WHENEVER POSSIBLE, AND SECONDLY THAT WE LOOK FOR DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES IN WHAT WE ARE DOING. I PREVIOUSLY WORKED FOR A FORTUNE 100 COMPANY WHO HAD 44 EMPLOYEES IN TWO STATES AND ATTENDED A TWO-DAXECUTIVE EDUCATION CLASS ON DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES. I BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS THE RISK OF RACIAL DISCRIMINATION, AGEISM, AS WELL AS FAVORING PEOPLE WHO ARE MORE COMFORTABLE WITH TECHNOLOGY, AND SO WHILE WE MAY HA HAD T PEOPLE WITH HIGH SCORES AND TWO PEOPLE THAT HAD LOWER SCORES, I THINK THAT IF YOU CONSIDERED THE DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES THAT MAY HAVE UNDERLIED SOME OF OUR ACTIVITIES, ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT MUCH OF IT OR MOST OF IT FACE THAT. TH ZOOM, WE NEED TO INHE NS TODAY, PIONEER HIGH SCHOOL HAD AN ARTICLE ABOUT DISCRIMINATION. IT IS EVERYWHERE, AND WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO RECOGNIZE IT AND TAKE THE APPROPRIATE ACTIONS. THANK YOU.
01:40:28.983: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
01:40:30.218: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I GUESS, FIRST, FOR MS. CELL, THE -- JUST INERMS OF --S OUTLINED IN THE MAYOR'S AMENDMENT, AND I ALSO DO APPRECIATE THAT -- I MEAN, I'M READY TO MAKE A RECOMMENDATION TONIGHT, BUT I ALSO INDICATED THAT, YOU KNOW, IF SOME FELT IT WAS NECESSARY TO CONDUCT SOME MORE INTERVIEWS, I'M COMFORTABLE WITH THAT, BUT I AOON'T WANT TO - I DIDN'T WANTO BE UNCLEAR ABOUT WHERE I KIND OF LAND RIGHT NOW, BUT TO PROVIDE YOU FOR MORE PUBLIC INPUT, T THE -- AND THE AMENDMENT THAT YOU BROUGHT FORWARD, MR. MAYOR, STATES THAT THE -- THAT THIS WILL ALL BE SUBJECT TO CANDIDATE AVAILABILITY BEFORE SEEMBER 8TH, ANDHAT COUNCIL WILL THEN MEET ON SEPTEMBER 14TH. THAT'S THE NEXT AND PRESUMABLY FINAL STEP TO VOTE ON THE CANDIDATES. YOU DO SAY "OR DETERMINE NEXT STEPS," BUT I THINK THE INTENT HERE IS TO JUST A FEW MORE WEEKS TO THE PROCS,BASICAY, AND THEN TO MAKE DISION. IF I'M UNDERSTANDING THIS OUTLINE THAT YOU'VE PROVIDED US HERE. AND I APPRECIATE THAT YOU'RE FRAMING IT THAT WAY. FOR THE PUBLIC INPUT PIECE, MS. CELL, CAN -- AGAIN I THINK, YOU KNOW, THESE EVALUATIONS, THE INTERVIEWS I THINK WERE ACTUALLY QUITE THOROUGH, AND WE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE NOTES ON THE CANDIDATES' Q&A, AND IN THE SEVEN AREAS THAT WE ALL -- THAT WERE RANKED PROFESSIONALLY BY YOU AS IMPORTANT SKILLS FOR THIS JOB, AND I THINK THAT THOSE INTERVIEWS ARE VERY, VERY INFORMATIVE, ANDOULD BE A GOOD AND HPFUL FRAMEWORK FOROLKS, ASPPOSED TO, I DON'T KNOW, ONE-ON-ONES THAT MIGHT NOT BE A CONSISTENT SORT OF FRAMEWORK. YOU ALSO PROVIDED US SAMPLE INTERVIEW QUESTIONS, AND I THINK YOU DID THAT, CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG, TO BE FAIR ACROSS THE BOARD, AND SOME CSE TO AS THOSE MPLE QUESTIO. I KIND OF, YOU KNOW, WORKED WITHIN THE ATTRIBUTE BUT ASKED MY OWN QUESTIONS. OTHERS DID THAT AS WELL, BUT I THINK WHAT YOU WERE TRYING TO DO WAS MAKE IT FAIR AND UNIFORM, SO HERE -- YOU KNOW, HERE ARE THESE GUIDELINES THAT YOU ALL NEED TO FOLLOW. WITH THE ONE-ON-ONE FRAMEWORK, HOW CAN YOU ENSURE THAT THAT'S WHAT'S GOINGO HAEN? AND, YOU KNOW, THA INAPPROPRIATE QUESTIONS, BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU DO INTERVIEWS, YOU DO NOT ASK. THE CITY COULD BE VERY LIABLE IF PEOPLE VEER OFF THE SCRIPT, BASICALLY, AND ASK THOSE KINDS OF QUESTIONS. SO, THERE DOES NEED TO BE A PROCESS, A CLEAR PROCESS, AND OVERSIGHT SO THIS IS DONE PROPERLY. SO,OULD YOU SPEAK TTHAT?
01:43:34.202: >> SURE. THOSE ARE ALL GREAT POINTS, THAT I WILL ENDEAVOR TO BUILD IN. ONE OF THE DIFFERENT DYNAMICS IS WHERE THERE ISN'T -- WHERE IT'S A SMALL GROUP CONVERSATIONR AN INDIVIDUAL CONVERSATION, THE DYNAMICS AND IMPLICATIONS ARE DIFFERENT THAN IF IT'S A PANEL INTERVIEW THAT'S BEING INTERVIEWED BY POTENTIALLY HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE. SO THAT'S WHERE I THINK YOU CAN HAVE SLIGHT DIFFERENCES WITH THE DIFFERENT FORMATS, BUT I CAN ONE  MY STAFF PPLE ISTHA I OR PREST DURING THE ONE-ON-ONE CONVERSATIONS SO MAKE SURE THAT SOMETHING REALLY ISN'T AWKWARD. AGAIN, THE WAY I ENVISIONED IS WITH THE NEXT PERSON IN LINE, IT WOULDN'T BE COMPLETELY PRIVATE BUT WITH SOCIAL DISTANCING, AND WE NEED TO SPREAD PEOPLE OUT SO THAT THERE'S AN APPROPRIATE NUMBER OF PEOPLE ON SITE. I HAVE STARTED TO THINK ABOUT THE LOGISTICAL ISSUES TO MANAGE THAT. I HAVE ALSO THOUGHT ABOUT GIVING AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A BROAD RANGE OF CONSISTENT QUESTIONS TO BE ASKED TO ALL OF THE FINALISTS. THAT WOULD BE VIDEO RECORDED, BECAUSE MY GUESS IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET EVERYTHING DONE QUICY,HERE MIGHT B NDIDES COMG INN DIFFERENT DAYS, AND I WOULDN'T WANT TO GIVE ANYBODY AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE BY LIVE BROADCAST OF THE QUESTIONS, BUT I WOULD RATHER WANT TO -- YOU KNOW, MY THOUGHT WAS TO KIND OF VIDEOTAPE THEM, GATHER THEM UP, AND THEN AT THE SAME TIME SIMULTANEOUSLY RELEASE THEM TO THE COMMUNITY SO THAT, AGAIN, A BROAD RANGE OF PEOPLE CAN VIEW THEM AND PROVIDE FEEDCK I MORE TIMEHAN WHAT WAS NE BEFORE, BECAUSE THAT WAS A PIECE OF FEEDBACK. SO THE ELEMENTS WOULD BE KIND OF A PRESENTATION AND PANEL DISCUSSION THAT WOULD BE VIDEOTAPED AND SHARED BROADLY. THERE WOULD BE STAFF TOURS AND SMALL GROUPS OF STAFF, AND THERE WOULD BE, AGAIN, THIS KIND OF QUESTIONS IN A FORUM THAT IS AND CONDUCIVE TO ONE-ON-ONE, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED ABOUT INAPPROPRIATE QUESTIONS AND MAKING SURE THAT THERE IS SOME KIND OF ASSURANCE THAT ERYONE'S BEST TERESTS AR PROTECTED.
01:46:07.121: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  THANK YOU.
01:46:09.123: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER?
01:46:10.024: >> COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER: THANK YOU, MAYOR TAYLOR. YES, I SENSE THAT THIS BODY IS MOVING TOWARDS POSTPONING AND ALLOWING FOR EVEN A GREATER, HUGER AMOUNT OF INFORMATION IN A QUEST FOR CONSENSUS, AND I CAN -- I CAN GO ALONG WITH THE MAJORITY ON THAT. HOWEVER, I SENSE IN THE COMMENTS TONIGHT THAT WE ALREADY HAVE A CONSENSUS SURROUNDING OUR 15-YEAR LOYAL PUBLIC SERVANT, TOM CRAWFORD, WHO HAS SERD AS CITY ADMINISTRATOR, NOT ONCE BUT THREE TIMES, TRUSTED BY THREE SEPARATE COUNCILS. SO, I FEEL THAT WE HAVE CONSENSUS, AND I JUST WANT TO UNDERLINE SOME OF WHAT'S ALREADY BEEN SAID, POSSIBLY BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM AND OTHERS, POSTPONINGN TIMELINE HERE TO VOTE ON MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 14, THAT IS MY INTENTION, IS TO WRAP THIS UP ON SEPTEMBER 14, AND I WILL JUST SHARE THAT I HAVE RECEIVED -- WE HAVE ALL RECEIVED, AND I HAVE RECEIVED EMAILS I HAVE RECEIVED PERSON CONVERSATIONS AND PHONE CALLS FROM RESIDENTS, AND THEY ARE CONCERNED THAT THIS IS SOME KIND OF SLIPPERY SLOPE, WHERE THERE MAY BE MEMBERS ON COUNCIL WHO ARE EVEN SEEKING TO HAVE ADNISTTOR SO THAT IT MIGHT BE EASIER TO FURTHER CONFLICTS OF INTEREST OR ULTERIOR MOTIMOTIVES, AND I STRONGLY FEEL A FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY TO SERVE AND REPRESENT THE CITIZENS OF ANN ARBOR TO MAKE SURE THATHAT DOESOT HAPPEN, AND I'M SORRY TO BE SO FRANK AND BLUNT, BUT THAT CAN BE THE BACKSTORY GOING ON HERE, AND I WANT TO DO EVERYTHING THAT NEEDS TO BE SAID, THAT THAT SHOULD NOT BE PPENING. THANK YOU.
01:48:37.304: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN? THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. MAN: I WOULD ENCOURAGE EVERY SINGLE COLLEAGUE TO NOT PLAY AND GIVE VOICE TO ABSOLUTELY LUDICROUS CONSPIRACY THEORY, AND I THINK THAT WE NEED TO DO THE HARD WORK OF SPEAKING TO THESE FOUR INCREDIBLE PROFESSIONALS WHO HAVE GIVEN THEIR TIME AND ENERGY TO APPLYING TO THIS TOP JOB WHAT EY -- AND THEY RIGHTLY SERVE OUR ATTENTN. TO SAY ANYTHING ELSE, TO DEAL IN ACCUSATIONS OF CORRUPTION, IS JUST GOING TO FURTHER DIVIDE THIS PROCESS AND NOT GET US TO CONSENSUS. MAYORAYLOR: COUNCILMEER ERE. SMITH.
01:49:22.183: >> COUNCILMEMBERMITH:  I'M GOING TO ECHO EXACTLY WHAT COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN SAID. I THOUGHT THAT WAS COMPLETELY AN INAPPROPRIATE THROWING OUT OF A RIDICULOUS CONSPIRACY THEORY. I THINK THE SUGGESTION THAT ANY OF US WANTS TO HIRE SOMEBODY THAT'S NOT THE BEST APPLICANT IS RIDICULOUS. I THINK IT SHOWS A COMPLETE LACK OF RESPECT FOR YOUR COLLEAGUES THE CITYHATE WORK FOR.  FOR I THINK IT IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF WHERE THE POLITICAL DIALOGUE IS IN THE CITY, AND IT'S DISGUSTING TO ME. I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW DISAPPOINTED I AM IN THAT ACCUSATION, COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER. I WOULD HOPE THAT YOU WOULD RETRACT THAT OUT OF DECENCY, BUT I DON'T EXPE I
01:50:06.727: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
01:50:09.196: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD: COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER WAS RAISING A CONCERN. I COULD RAISE SIMILAR CONCERNS ABOUT DEATH THREATS, ABOUT ATTACKS ON MY COMPUTER SYSTEM, MY WEBSITE, BUT I WON'T. WHAT I WANT TO ASK, AND THIS IS APPROPRIATE WITH AMY CELL, I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE OUR CITY ATTORNEY PREPARE A SHORT PAPER OR MAYBE THERE IS SOMETHING OUT THERE ALREADY, TO MAKE US AWARE OF DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES. IT CAN BE AS SIMPLE AS YOU INTERVIEW SOMEONE, AND THEY ARE WEARING THE SAME SHOES THAT YOU HAVE THEY GTO THEAME RELIOUS FACILITY, THEY BELONG TO KIWANIS. THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS THAT CONNECT US, AND WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE WHEN WE ARE INTERVIEWING THAT WE ARE NOT BEING INFLUENCED BY THAT.
01:51:10.591: >> COUILMBER GRISWOLD, YOU HAVE HIRED A RECRUITER, AMY CELL, WHO HAS WALKED THROUGH THE PROCESS WITH YOU, WHO HAS PROVIDED INSTRUCTION ON QUESTIONS, WHO HAVE PROVIDED GUIDELINES ALREADY ON THIS THAT I HAVE OBVIOUSLY VIEWED, BUT SHE'S BEEN DOING THIS FOR A LONG TIME. THE ADMIN COMMITTEE HAS MET WITH HER EXTENSIVELY ABOUT THIS, AND I THINK THAT IT'S BEST FOR ME TO ASK FURTHER ISSUES AT A SUBSEQUENT TIME, BUT CERTAINLY, I CAN LOOK AT ALL OF THOSE THINGS. YOU KNOW, I WILL TALKOMY CELL. RUNNING THIS PROCESS, BUT, CERTAINLY, I WILL TALK TO HER. YOU CAN LOOK AT THE MATERIALS SHE'S ALREADY SENT. I CAN ALWAYS SEND SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS. WE ARE WELL VERSED IN THAT, AND SO I CAN DO THIS, BUT I AM ONLY SHOW THAT SHE'SEALLY ALREADY DONE THAT AT THIS POINT, BUT YOUR CONCERN ABOUT IT, WE CAN ALWAYS ADDRESS IT FURTHER BECAUSE THE ISSUES THAT YOU RAISE NEED TO BE ADDRESSED NOW.
01:52:34.608: >> OKAY. THANK YOU. AN AMY HAS BN EREMELY PROFESSIONAL AND HAS REALLY HELPED US WITHHIS PROCESS. DISCRIMINATION IS JUST SOMETHING THAT YOU NEED TO ADDRESS DAILY, AND SO ANYTHING THAT YOU CAN DO TO HELP US, TO KEEP AN AWARENESS OF IT, I APPRECIATE, BUT WHATEVER YOU AND AMY DECIDE IS FINE.
01:52:55.763: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER. GOING TO WIHOLD MY REMARKS AND ENCOURAGE US TO VOTE ON THIS AMENDMENT.
01:53:04.338: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:53:05.272: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  THANK YOU, MAYOR. LIKE MANY OF OUR DISCUSSIONS, IT GETS PRETTY HEATED, AND THIS IS NO EXCEPTION, AND I JUST -- YOU KNOW, I WANT TO THANK AMY AND HER  ASSTANTS IN THIS MATTER. THKS FOR RESPONDING TO MY EMAILS OVER THE WEEKEND, WITHIN AN HOUR EACH TIME, AND GUIDING US THROUGH THIS PROCESS, OBVIOUSLY, WE NEED SOMEONE HERE TO KEEP THIS FROM GOING OFF THE RAILS. WE ARE ALL PASSIONATE ABOUT OUR POSITIONS, AND I HOPE THAT THIS EXERCISE HERE ULTIMATELY LEADS US TO THE BEST OUTCOME, AND THAT'S TO GET BEHIND A NEW LEADER AND GIVE HIM THE SUPPORT OR H THE SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED TO DO THE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. AND I WILL SAY THAT, YOU KNOW, MANY TIMES, I WILL KNOW WITHIN THE FIRST TEN MINUTES WHETHER I'M GOING TO HIRE SOMEBODY OR NOT. IT GENERALLY DOESN'T TAKE HOURS AND HOURS TO FIGURE THAT OUT, AND I KNOW I'M NOT HIRING A BUSSERERE O A LINE COOK, BUT MANY TIMES, YOU CAN MAKE A DECISION IN 45 MINUTES. IT DOES NOT REQUIRE MUCH MORE THAN THAT WHEN YOU'RE GIVEN THE INFORMATION WE WERE GIVEN AHEAD OF TIME. SO, ANYHOW, I APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S COOPERATION IN THIS IMPORTT AT WHOEVER GETS THE POSION HAS THEUPPORT OF THIS ENTIRE BODY.

01:56:25.772: >> WELL, LIKE EXPENSES, TRAVEL EXPENSES FOR THE CANDIDATES WOULD BE AN ADDITIONAL COST, BUT THERE'S NO ADDITIONAL FEE FOR MY TIME AND SERVICES.
01:56:34.148: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  SO, BECAUSE OF THIS NOTION OF WE MIGHT HAVE THEM HERE TO DO LKROUGHS OR WHATEVER AND MEET STAFF IN DIFFERENT LOCATIONS OR SOMETHING THAT CANDIDATES WHO CHOOSE TO JOIN US FROM A DISTANCE, AND NONE OF THEM ARE SUPER FAR AWAY, SO THOSE EXPENSES WOULD BE COVERED BY THE CITY SOMEHOW?

I JUST TNK THAT THE PUBLIC NES TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR DOES AND WHO REPORTS TO THEM, ET CETERA.  I THINK IT'S MISLEADING FOR MANY. I KNOW OF MANY COUNCILMEMBERS, MYSELF INCLUDED WHEN I FIRST DECLARED THAT I WAS RUNNING, DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE ROLE OF THE CI ADMINISATOR, AND SO I REALLY DO THINK WE NEED TO EDUCATE THE PUBLIC AS TO THE ROLE OF THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR, AS WE SOLICIT THE FEEDBACK FROM THE PUBLIC IN THIS PROCESS SO THAT WE GET THE BEST FEEDBACK WE CAN POSSIBLY GET.
01:58:22.723: >> I'LL WORK ON THAT. THANK YO

02:01:40.787: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  YES, WE N. YOU'RE LIV
02:01:44.825: >> WELL, THIS IS ZACHARY STORY, AND, FIRST OF ALL, I WANTED TO APOLOGIZE TO COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER. MY LAST PUBLIC COMMENT, I MISHEARD YOU, AND I WENT BACK AND LISTENED TO THE VIDEO. IF YOU WENT BACK AND LISTENED TO IT, I THINK YOU MIGHT SEE MY ERROR  THAT. IT WAS VERY HARDO HEAR. BUT, NONETHELESS, I DID NOT INTEND TO SPREAD ANY INFORMATION OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. MOVING ON TO TONIGHT, AND FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU ALL FOR EXTENDING THE PROCESS, AND I LOOK FORWARD TO LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE CANDIDATES. I KIND OF AM DISTURBED BY AEW THINGS THAT I WAS HEARING TONIGHT FROM COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, SUGGESTING THAT LIKE EMAILS ARE ORCHESTRATED BY CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS ABOUT ISSUES, YOU KNOW. FOR AN ENTIRE YEAR, I HAVE DEVOTED A LOT OF MY TIME TO WATCHING ALL OF YOUR MEETINGS, SOMETIMES UNTIL 3:00 A.M., STAYING ON SO I CAN GIVE MY PUBLIC COMMENT, AND TO BE INSULTED LIKE THAT IS JUST, YOU KNOW, IMPROPER AND I DO NOT APPRECIATE THAT. COUNCILMEMBER NELSON, WHEN YOU'RE -- YOU KNOW, I'M ACCUSING YOU OF INSULTING THE PUBLIC RIGHT NOW. WHEN YOU SAID MOST OF THE PUBLIC DOES NOT UNDERSTAND OR IS NOT AWARE OF THE INTRICACIES OF THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR, YOU KNOW, THAT'S A FAILURE ON THE CITY'S PART. YOU KNOW, WE NEED TO EDUCATE AND PARTICIPATE IN OUTREACH TTHE CI IF RESIDENTS ARE NOT AWARE ENOUGH OF THEIR OWN CITY GOVERNMENT, AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING IN A DEMOCRACY THAT WE SHOULD BE FOSTERING, AND SUGGESTING OR REPEATING A RESIDENT'S COMMENT TO YOU ABOUT SOME COUNCILMEMBERS WANTING TO HIRE SOMEONE WHO IS LESS QUALIFIED SO THEY ARE EASIER TO PUSH AROUND, THAT -- I MEAN, IT'S INCREDIBLE FOR YOU TO INSINUATE SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND TO NOT RIGHT AWAY SAY, HEY, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE -- WE ALL HAVE OUR POLITICALIFFERENCES ITHE CI, BUT TO ACCUSE THAT THERE'S SOMETHING --
02:04:23.149: >> 30 SECONDS.
02:04:23.783: >> -- NEFARIOUS LIKE THAT GOING ON WITH ONE OF YOUR COLLEAGUES IS RIDICULOUS. SO, I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME OUTREACH, IF NOT NOW INTO THE FUTURE, I DON'TKNOW LLAVE TO CALL ANOER TIME AND TALK ABOUT THIS MORE BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE OUTREACH TO THE STUDENTS. THEY MAKE UP THE LARGEST PORTION OF RENTERS IN THE CITY. THEY HAVE A LOT OF VIEWPOINTS THAT ARE MISSING, SO I THINK THAT AS PART OF CITY'S REGULAR OUTREACH, THEY SHOULD DO A PUBLIC ENGAGEMENTN THE DIAG, AND ESPECIALLY NOW WHEN STUDENTS ARE -- NEED SOMETHING TO DO THAT'S ABLE TO BE SOCIALLY DISTANT AND SAFE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
02:05:13.466: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU.
02:05:21.741: >>ALLER 439.
02:05:33.553: >> HI, THERE. CAN EVERYBODY HEAR ME OKAY?
02:05:36.056: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  YES, WE CAN SIR.
02:05:38.324: >> EXCELLENT. THIS IS HENRY O'CONNELL. I VE CALD IN NBER TIMES THIS MUCH REGARDING THE ISSUE OF A MASKING ORDER, AND FIRST, I WANT TO APPLAUD THE COUNCIL FOR THEIR UNANIMOUS APPROVAL OF A VERY BOLD ORDER, WITH GATHERING AND MASKING, AND FOR DOING SO IN A PEACEABLE MANNER. I GREATLY APPLAUD YOU. THIS GOES EVEN BEYOND THE BOUNDS OF WHAT I HAD HOPED WE COULD ACHIEVE WHEN I FIRSTTARTED CALLING IN EARER THIS MONTH. HOWEVER, I WANT TO ALERT YOU AND THE GREATER PUBLIC TO THE FACT THAT THIS IS, OF COURSE, JUST BEGINNING WITH THIS NEW CHAPTER OF STUDENTS RETURNING. I PARTICULARLY WANT TO CALL ATTENTION TO A GRAVE EMBARRASSMENT THAT IS CURRENTLY CIRCULATING ON THE INTERNET. ANN ARBOR HAS BECOME AN INTERNET MEME. AT THE TIME I'M SPEAKING RIGHT NOW, NEARLY 75,000 UPVOTES HAVE BEEN REGISTERED FOR A PHOTO TAKEN IN ANN ARBOR RECENTLY ON REDDIT.COM DEPICTING A HOUSE WITH UNMASKED PARTY GOERS DENSELY CONGREGATING OUTSIDE, AND DEPLORABLY A BANNER HANGING BEHIND THEM THAT SAYS IQUOTE, AND I APOGIZE FOR THE LANGUA, QUOTE, "YOU CAN'T EAT -- WITH A MASK ON," UNQUOTE. AND THIS IS SHOWING HORRIBLE DECISION MAKING ON THE PART OF OUR NEWLY ARRIVED RESIDENTS. SO WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO NOTE HERE IS WE HAVE INDIVIDUALS WHO SEEMLITHELY INDIFFENT TO ENNGERING THE HEALTH OF OTHERS D THE GREATER COMMUNITY, AND NOW THAT WE HAVE THIS MASKING AND GATHERING ORDER IN PLACE, I CALL ON ALL OF US TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN HELP PEACEFULLY ENFORCE IT, BECAUSE THERE WILL BE BODY BAGS ON ALL OF OUR HANDS IF WE DON'T WORK AS A COMMUNITY TO ACHIEVE THAT, T MAKE COMMON SENSE EVAIL, AND THAT WOULD BE A MASSIVE SHAME. SO, THANK YOU AGAIN TO THE COUNCIL FOR TAKING BOLD ACTION ON THIS MATTER, AND I WOULD JUST LIKE TO ASK, NOW THAT WE HAVE THIS STATE OF EMERGENCY IN PLACE, THAT WE CAN BE AS NIMBLE AS NEEDED TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN TAMP DOWN THE SITUATION, VERY POOR ART, AND I'M JUST GLAD THAT WE HAVE THE MEASURES IN PLACE NOW WHERE WE CAN BE MORE FIERCE IN WHAT WE CAN DO TO BRING IT UNDER CONTROL. SO, THANK YOU SO MUCH. I YIELD MY TIME.
02:08:08.141: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU.
02:08:17.383: >> CALLER 924.
02:08:27.527: >> GOOD EVENING, CITY COUNCIL AND MAYOR TAYLOR. I'M ALL FOR HIRING CRAWFORD, BUT I BELIEVE THAT THE PUBLIC SHOULD BE GRANTED MORE TIME TO LOOK AT THE CANDIDATES. IF I BELIEVEHAT SOMNE I THE BE PICK, AND DO BELIE CRAWFORD IS THE BEST PICK, THEN I HAVE NO FEAR AS TO ALLOWING MORE TIME TO LOOK INTO CRAWFORD AND TO LOOK AT SINCERELY THE OTHER ONES WHO WANT THE JOB. IF I BELIEVE THAT SOMEONE IS THE BEST CANDIDATE, WHY WOULD I FEAR ALLOWING MORE TIME TO OTHERS? SINCE WHEN HAVE YOU SPOKEN STNGLY AGAINST ME PUBLIC EDBACK? THAT'S VERY ATYPICAL BEHAVIOR OF YOU. MANY OF YOU HAVE BEEN STRONG ADVOCATES OF PUBLIC COMMENTS, AND NOW YOU ARE GOING AGAINST THAT PHILOSOPHY. MAY I REMIND COUNCIL THAT TONIGHT'S SESSION OCCURRED WITHOUT THE TYPICAL PUBLIC COMMENTS BEFOREHAND THAT WOD BE NORMAL FOR A REGULAR SESSION. AN EXCELLENT CANDIDATE WOULD BE ONE WHO HAS A DEMONSTRATED HISTORY OF WORKING WITH DIFFERENT TYPES OF COUNCILS, SO THERE WOULD BE NO WAIT FOR NEW CITY COUNCILMEMBERS. THANKS FOR LISTENING TO MY CONCERN, AND HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.
02:09:39.966: >> MOR TAYLOR:  ANK YOU.
02:09:48.141: >> CALLER 340.
02:10:12.065: >> GREETINGS, CITY COUNCIL, AND MR. MAYOR. LUIS VASQUEZ FROM THE FIRST WARD. I JUST WANTED TO EXPRESS MY WIOU-- WITH E CITY COUNCIL MEETING NOT HANG PUBLIC INPUT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE MEETING, WHERE WE COULD EXPRESS OUR OPINIONS ABOUT THE PROCESS THAT YOU ARE ENGAGING IN. I'M DISAPPOINTED IN THAT. BUTAL, I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE WHOLE PROCESS, AND I'M, YOU KNOW, FROM THE GET GO, FROM THE FIRING OF HOWARD LAZARUS WITHOUT CAUSE AT THE BEHEST OF AN OUT-OF-TOWN ATTORNEY, WHO SICALLY PUT SOME OFOU UP TO IT. AND ALSO, I'LL JUST REFER TO A COMMENT FROM ANNE BANNISTER AT THE JUNE 29TH MEETING, ASKING IF THE CITY REALLY NEEDED TO EVEN HA A SRCHANCOULD IT INSTEAD JUST STICK WITH OUR EXISTING PLAN, AND THAT JUST SEEMS TO ME JUST SUSPECT FROM THE GET-GO, AND IT DOESN'T LEND TOWARDTRSPARENCY, AAS BEEN PROFESSED BY MANY COUNCILMEMBERS. AND, YOU KNOW, I'M FINE WITH MR. CRAWFORD. I THINK HE'S A WONDERFUL CFO FOR THE CITY AND CAN SERVE AS AN INTERIM AND HAS DONE SO WITH DISTINCTIO BUT, YOU KNOW, I'M A FAN OF MORE PUBLIC PROCESS. I WANT TO HEAR MORE FROM ALL OF THE OTHER CANDIDATES, AND I'M GLAD THAT DECISION WAS MADE TONIGHT. SO, KUDOS FOR THAT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. AND I HOPE THE BEST DECISIONS ARE MADE FOR OUR CITY. THANKS.
02:12:35.308: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YO
02:12:42.115: >> CALLER 588. HI, COUNCILMEERS. TH IS PETER GUE. I'M A RESIDENT IN WARD 2, AND COUNCILMEMBER NELSON, I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU SAID TONIGHT, BECAUSE YOU REALLY GOT THEM WRONG. THE FIRST THING THAT YOU GOT WRONG WAS THE IDEA THAT THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR POSITION IS NOT AN TWARFACING POSITION THAT PEOPLE IN THE PUBLIC -- AND WHAT I FOUND WITH THE CANDIDATES THIS SUMMER WAS THE EXACT OPPOSITE. PEOPLE NOTICED HOW THEY WERE TREATED. THEY DIDN'T APPROVE OF IT. AND, YOU KNOW AND THEY VED -- THEY VOTED THAT WAY BECAUSE OF IT. OKAY? SO, YOU REALLY HAVE MISUNDERSTOOD THAT POINT. THE OTHER POINT THAT YOU MISUNDERSTOOD IS THE IDEA THAT PEOPLE LIKE ME, YOU KNOW, WHO SENT YOU NOTES DESCRIBING A DESIRE TO SLOW THIS PROSS DOWN A TT BIT- SO, WHAT YOU'R MISUNDERSTANDING IS THAT WE ARE NOT BEING MANIPULATED TO DO THAT. INSTEAD, YOUR BAD BEHAVIOR AROUND HOWARD LAZARUS AND AROUND THE PLAN THAT SOME COUNCILMEMBERS HAVE, THIS BAD BEHAVIOR IS MOTIVATING US INSTEAD TO BE SEEKING OUT OTHERS IN THE COMMUNITYND LEADERS IN E COMMUNITY WHO ARE WILLING TO STAND UP AND TO DO BETTER. SO YOU HAVE BOTH OF THOSE BACKWARDS. THAT'S ALL THAT I HAVE TO COMMENT ON TONIGHT. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY.
02:14:39.498: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU.
02:14:50.343: >> HI, THIS IS MICHELLE HUGHES, AND I'M GLAD THAT WE HAVE MORE TIME FOR PUBLIC INPUT ON THIS, BUT I HOPE THAT IT'S NOT JUST MORE TIME THAT WE HAVE. I HOPE THAT WE HAVE SOME SPECIFIC PLANS AND IDEAS ABOUT HOW TO LIKE PROACTIVELY ENGAGE CERTAIN COMMUNITIES AND GIVE THEM WHAT THEY NEED IN ORDER TO MEANINGFULLY ENGAGE WITH THIS. IF IT'S JUST MORE TIME, YOU'RE GOING TO GET MORE EMAILS FROM THE PEOPLE YOU ALWAYS GET MORE EMAILS FROM, BUT I THINK THIS IS A DECISION THAT INVOLVES A LOT OF PEOPLE, AND WE SHOULD BE GOING OUT OF OUR WAY TO ENGAGE PEOPLE THAT AREN'T TYPICALLY ENGAGED, AND WEHOULBE, YOU KNOW, PROACTIVELY SEEKING OUT COMMUNITIES. WE SHOULD BE, YOU KNOW, GIVING THEM, I DON'T KNOW, FOOD OR CHILDCARE, WHATEVER THEY NEED IN ORDER TO LIKE MEANINGFULLY PARTICIPATE IN SOME KIND OF LIKE FOCUS GROUP TYPE OF ACTIVITY. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE NEED TO DO, BUT WE NEED -- MY POINT IS WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING PROACTIVE TO ENGAGE OPLE THAT AREN'T TYPICALLY ENGAGED,ECAUSE THIS IS A CITY -- THIS IS A DECISION THAT'S GOING TO AFFECT EVERYONE IN THE CITY FOR A LONG TIME. IT'S A BIG DEAL, AND WE NEED TO TREAT IT LIKE A BIG DEAL, AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE CONSENSUS NOT JUST AT THE COUNCIL TABLE BUT THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE CITY. THANK YOU.
02:16:35.281: >> MAYOR TAYLO  THANK YO
02:16:49.528: >> ANNA FOSTER?
02:16:57.536: >> , THIIS ANNA FOSTER, WARD 5. I WAS GOING TO MAKE A REQUEST FOR MORE TIME AT THE START OF THE MEETING, BUT PUBLIC COMMENT HAPPENED AT THE END, AS HAS BEEN NOTED. BUT I DO REALLY APPRECIATE THE VOTE TO EXTEND MORE TIME TO THE COMMUNITY TO WEIGH IN ON THIS AND TO ALLOW STAFF TO HAVE MORE TIME TO RESPOND TOHE FORUMS YOU HA MADE AVAILABLE TO THE I'M A FAIRLY CONNECTED -- OR NOT "CONNECTED," I'M FAIRLY TUNED IN TO COUNCIL MEETINGS AND SPEND MANY A MONDAY NIGHT WITH THIS ZOOM PROJECTED ON TO MY LIVING ROOM TV, AND I ACTUALLY ONLY WAS SORT OF KEYED INTO WATCHING THENTERVIEWS AND PARTICIPATING IN THE SURVEYS BY MICHELLE HUGHES, THE PREVIOUS CALLER'S TWEETS. AND I KNOW I HAD SEEN STUFF ABOUT IT, BUT COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER POINTED THIS OUT IN A COUPLE OF THE INTERVIEWS. WE DON'T HAVE A LOCAL NEWSPAPER, AND WHILE PUSHING THINGS OUT VIA EML AND FACEBOOKIGHT SM LIKET'S HITNG A LOT OF PEOPLE, WE ARE KIND OF GETTING A LOT OF INFORMATION OVERLOAD IN THE MIDDLE OF A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION AND A NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS, SO EVEN AS A PERSON WHO IS FAIRLY ATTENTIVE TO LOCAL POLITICS, THIS NEARLY SLIPPED THROUGH MY CRACKS, AND SO I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THE ALSO, AS COUILMEMBER RAMWI SAID, MAYB HE HASN'T HEA AN ORGANIC UPRISING OF COMMUNITY VOICES AROUND THIS ISSUE, BUT ORGANIC THINGS -- WELL, I GUESS THAT'S NOT EXCLUSIVELY TRUE. MANY THINGS JUST DON'T GROW IN THE DARKNESS, AND I APPRECIATE YOU GIVING MORE TIME TO THIS ISSUE SOHAT TNGSAN GW AND SO THAT PEOPLE CAN CHIME IN JUST A LITTLE BIT. AND I APOLOGIZE FOR NOT EMAILING ABOUT THIS LAST WEEK. I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW REALLY THAT THERE WAS GOING TO BE A DECISION MADE TODAY FROM THOSE COUNCIL -- FROM THOSE SURVEYS, SO, THANK YOU FOR EXTENDING OUR OPPORTUNITIES TO ENGAGE WITH THIS PROCESS. I REALLY, REALLY DEEPLY PRIA IT D PE THAT U CONSER ALL OF THE CANDIDATES EVENLY AND WITHOUT BIAS, AS GRISWOLD POINTED OUT. THANKS.
02:19:16.509: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU.
02:19:20.813: >> CALLER 684.
02:19:34.126: >> YES, HI, THIS IS ERIC STURGESS CALLING FROM THE FIRST WARD. JUST A COUPLE OF THINGS. FIRST OFF, THANK YOU TO AMY CELL FOR ALL OF HER WORK ON THIS. I NOTICED THAT 12 STAFF MEMBERS GAVE THEIR INPUT. I WAS READING IN THE COUNCIL MINUTES, AND I FOUND THAT INTERESTIN THAT ONLY 12 VE EIR INPUT. I THINK HAVING BROADER INPUT IS GOOD, BUT MY QUESTION IS, WHO ARE WE REACHING OUT TO IN THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY TO HAVE INPUT? WHO ARE WE REACHING OUT TO IN THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY? ARE WE TRULY REACHING OUT TO DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES TO GET THIS INPUT? BECAUSE THEIR INPUT IS CRITICAL AS WELL AS EVERYONE ELSE'S. SO I WOULD REALLY HOPE THAT WE HAVE A FOCUS ON MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE TRULY GETTING EVERYBODY'S INPUT AND NOT JUST THE USUAL INPUT. I WOULD COMMENT THAT THE CITIZENS, YOU KNOW, PANEL AND THE STAFF ALL GAVE MR. CRAWFORD TH HIGHEST AND THE HIGHLY RECOMMENDED COLUMN, AND SO DID COUNCIL, AND I THINK THE CITIZENS PANEL, WHICH HAD FIVE OF THE INCOMING COUNCILMEMBERS, THAT THAT CARRIES A LOT OF WEIGHT WITH ME. SO I WOULD HOPE THAT WHEN WE ASK FOR THE CITIZENS' INPUT THAT WE MMITIESHAON'T ALWAYS HE GET REACHED OUT TO AND THAT WE ARE ALLOWING THEM TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROCESS. LASTLY, I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SAY THAT I WANT TO THANK, YOU KNOW, EVERYONE WHO INTERVIEWED. I WAS ABLE TO WATCH THEIR ONE-NUTE, SEVEN-QUESTI ANSWERS, AS WELL AS READ THEIR RESUMÉ, AS WELL AS READ THEIR COVER LETTER, WHICH WAS ALL READILY ACCESSIBLE ONLINE, AND WHILE WE DON'T HAVE A NEWSPAPER, MOST OF US HAVE THE INTERNET AND A COMPUTER, AND I WAS ABLE TO WATCH THE INTERVIEWS. SO, THERE WAS QUITE A BIT OF INFORMATION OUT THERE, AND I ALSO HAVE THIS THING CALD GOOGLE THAI WAS ABLE TO TYPE IN THEIR NAME AND GET A LITTLE BIT MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE CANDIDATES. I JUST THOUGHT THAT I WOULD LET PEOPLE KNOW THAT THAT IS A POSSIBILITY AS WELL, IF THEY TRULY WANT MORE INFORMATION, YOU KNOW, AS ONE OF THE CANDIDATES WAS FIRED FROM THEIR JOB, I THINK WITH CAUSE OR WITHOUT CAUSE -- I CAN'T REMEMBER, BUT THERE'S INFORMATION O THE, D I ULD EOURAGE PEOPLE TO LOOK THATUP. THANK YOU. HAVE A GREAT DAY.
02:22:08.414: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU.
02:22:12.718: >> CALLER 205 HEY, THIS ISOEPALDING. I JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF QUICK THINGS HERE. I WANTED TO THANK KATHY GRISWOLD FOR SPEAKING UP ABOUT EQUITY, IN TERMS OF THE SEARCH FOR THE CITY MANAGER THERE -- OR ADMINISTRATOR THERE. I THOUGHT THAT THAT'S SUPER IMPORTANT, AND I DID WANT TO SAY KIND OF AT THE 100,000-FOOT LEVEL THAT I NEVER WOULD HAVE GOENNYERE INTERESTED IN ANN ARBOR POLITICS IF SOME OF MY FRIENDS HADN'T TOLD ME TO TAKE A LOOK, AND THE REASON THAT THEY TOLD ME TO TAKE A LOOK IS BECAUSE OF THE SITUATION INVOLVING LAZARUS, SO TAKE THAT FOR WHAT IT IS. WHEN IT COMES TO BEING WORLD FAMOUS, AGAIN, FOR OUR CITY HAVING A UNIVERSITY WITH A BUN OF IDIOTS PARTYING WITHOUT MASKS ON AND NOT TAKING CORONAVIRUS SERIOUSLY, I THINK THAT'S AWFUL. I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD FORCE ANYONE TO BE EVICTED OR HAVE THEIR POWER TURNED OFF, BUT I THINK THAT THEY SHOULD BE FORWARDED TO SIT THROUGH THE CITY OF ANN ARBOROUNCIL ETINGS UNTIL 3:0A.M., WITH THE GRIMY AND AWKWARD COMMENTS ON ISSUES LIKE LAND USE. BUT THAT'S ALL I HAVE GOT TO SAY. THANK YOU, EVERYONE.
02:23:39.738: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU.
02:23:40.339: >> MAYOR, WE DO HAVE ONE OTHER CALLER ON THE LINE, BUT THEY DO NOT HAVE THEIR HAND UP.
02:23:45.511: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  CALLER 180, IF YOU HAVE NOT SPOKEN AT PUBLIC COMMENT AND YOU WISH TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT -- YOU APPEAR TO BE GONE. IS TRE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT? SEEING NO ONE, PUBLIC COMMENT IS CLOSED. DO WE HAVE COMMUNICATIONS TODAY FROM COUNCIL? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
02:24:03.962: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  THANK YOU. YEAH, I JUST WANT TO SPEAK ABOUT A COUPLE OF THESE COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE. I KNOW COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER HAS MADE A COMMENT TT HAS RAISED EYEBROWS, AND NOT JUST IN THE COMMUNITY BUT EVEN HERE WITH MEMBERS ON THIS -- IN THIS BODY, ON THIS BODY, AND I WILL SAY THAT A STATEMENT MADE BY ONE COUNCILMEMBER IS NOT -- DOES NOT REPRESENT THIS COUNCIL, AND SO I KNOW MANY MEMBERS AND FOLKS VE -- HAVE -HAVE POINTED BACK AT THAT COMMENT THAT S MADE BACK IN JUNE, AND THAT WAS NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF THIS BODY, SO THAT'S ONE COUNCILMEMBER, NOT THE BODY OF COUNCIL, AND SO I'M JUST PUSHING BACK ON THAT. I DO WANT TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE A OUGHTFUL AND CONSIDERATE CONSIDERATION FOR THIS IMPORTANT JOB, AND AS WE WENT THROUGH THIS CONVERSATION TONIGHT, AT TIMES HEATED, AT THE END OF THE DAY, WE ALL RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF OUR DECISIONS AND YIELD IT TO THE CONCERNS OF OUR COLLEAGUES AND THE CONCERNS IN THE COMMUNITY, A WE VOTED 11-0 TO ALLOW THIS PROCESS TO CONTINUE FOR THREE WEEKS. SO, THERE'S GOING TO BE PEOPLE OUT THERE WRITING ALL SORTS OF NARRATIVES, YOU KNOW, AND I LEARNED THAT WHEN I STARTED RUNNING FOR COUNCIL HOW IMPORTANT IT WAS FOR ME TO WRITE MY OWN NARRATIVE AND NOTAVE OTHER PEOPLE WRITE MY NARRATIVE FOR ME, AND SO THE BOTTOM LINE IS, TONIGHT, WE VOTED 11-0 IN WAYS THE COMMUNITY HAS ASKED, IN THE WAYS OUR COLLEAGUES HAVE ASKED. SO, THAT IS IMPORTANT. ALL OF THE RHETORIC AND ALL OF THIS NONSENSE IS JUST THAT IN MANY WAYS, SO MY CONSTITUENT IN THE FIFTH WARD, ZACH, I AM SORRY, BUT IF YOU SENT ME AN EMAIL, I DID NOT RECEIVE IT. SO, I AM NOT SURE WHAT TO SAY TO THE ACCUSATIONS THAT YOU HAD OF MY COMMENTS MADE EARLIER, BUT I WILL SAY THAT THE COPY AND PASTE AIL HAS ALMOS NO EFFECT WHEN SOMEONE SENDS IT. IT'S NICE WHEN YOU HAVE AN ORGANIC EMAIL COMING IN FROM A CONSTITUENT WHO USE THEIR OWN WORDS IN ADDRESSING AN ISSUE, AND IN MY TIME ON COUNCIL, THERE HAS BEEN A CONCERTED EFFORT BY MEMBERS OF THIS BODY TO SEND OUT A WHISTLE TO CERTAIN PARTS OF THE COMMUNITY T SEN US EMAILS ON CERTAIN TOPICS, AND IT'S THE SAME EMAIL -- IT'S THE SAME COPY AND PASTE, WORD FOR WORD, PUT YOUR NAME HERE AND SEND, AND TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, I THINK PEOPLE -- AND I DON'T WANT TO DIMINISH THE INPUT THAT WE GET FROM RESIDENTS, BUT IF YOU WANT TO MAKE AN IMPACT ON YOUR COUNCILMEMBER, PUT IT IN YOUR OWN WORDS AND SEND IT TO THE COUNCILMEMBER IN YOUR WARD, AND THAT'S GOING TO HAVE A MUCH GREATER EFFECT THAN JUST SENDING A COPY AND PASTE TO ALL COUNCIL ON A PARTICULAR MATTER. THAT HAS ALMOST NO EFFECT, AND I WOULD JUST -- IF WE REALLY WANT GET OUR SAY O MATTERS AND REALLY HAVE AN IMPRESSION ON YOUR ELECTED OFFICIAL, THEN TAKE THE TIME AND PUT IT IN YOUR OWN WORDS AND SEND IT TO YOUR OWN REPRESENTATIVE, AND THE COPY AND PASTE MODEL HAS ALMOST NO EFFECT. SO, I APOLOGIZE. I DON'T WANT TO DIMINISH THE IMPORTANCE OF INCLUSIVITY AND LISTENING TO ALL OF MY CONSTITUENTS, BUT I WILL SAY THE ONES THAT PUT IT IN THEIR OWN WORDS HAVE A MUCH BIGGER IMPACT ON ME, AND I BELIEVE ON OTHERS AS WELL. SO, I APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S TE HERE, D I LK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THIS CONVERSATION AND THIS DECISION-MAKING PROCESS.
02:28:24.756: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER LUMM? COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, YOU ARE ON MUTE.
02:28:41.339: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  MY APOLOGIES. I THOUGHT I UNMUTED MYSELF. THANK YOU. THANKS FOR WAITING. I WOULD JUST LIKE TO USE THIS TIME TO BRIEFLY MAKE A RECOMMENDATION TO THE COUNCIL RULES COMMITTEE AND THE FUTURE MEMBERS OF THAT RULES COMMITTEE TO RESIT THE REQUEMENTS, THAT WE USED TO ALWAYS UTILIZE FOR PUBLIC SPEAKERS TO, WHEN THEY STATE THEIR NAME, TO ALSO PROVIDE THEIR ADDRESS. WHY DO WE HAVE THIS RULE? BECAUSE WE -- YOU KNOW, WHEN IT COMES TO PUBLIC COMMENT, FOR ONE, I THINK, YOU KNOW, WE WANT TO DEFER, UNDERSTANDABLY, TO OUR LOCAL REDENTS, THE FOLKS THAT WE REPRESENT. THIS EVENING, AGAIN, MR. SPALDING FROM OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA, TOOK HIS TIME TO WEIGH IN AND OPINE ON -- HE TOUCHED ON PLANNING AGAIN. HE MAKES VARIOUS COMMENTS ABOUT COUNCILMEMBERS I KNOW HE HAS NEVER MET. HE STARTED TO WATCH APPARENTLY COUNCIL MEETINGS. HE WAS A WELL-PAIDOLITAL CONSTANT FOR SOMOFHE NEW MEMBERS WHO WILL BE JOINING COUNCIL AND THEIR CONSTITUENCIES. HE'S WELL COMPENSATED, VERY WELL COMPENSATED, AND CRANKED OUT LOTS OF, YOU KNOW, NEGATIVE SOCIAL MEDIA PRODUCTS, AND NOW HE OBVIOUSLY HAS AN INTEREST AND IS ENGAGED AND HAS TAKEN TO COENTING DURG OUR PUBLIC COMMT OPPORTUNITIES, AND, AGAIN, I THINK IT'S -- THAT'S HIS RIGHT, CERTAINLY. I JUST THINK THOUGH, TO BE COMPLETELY TRANSPARENT, THAT IT WOULD BE -- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT -- AN IMPORTANT RULE THAT WE USED TO ABIDE BY, AND THAT IS REQUIRING OUR PUBLIC SPEAKERS TO STATE THEIR NAME AND THEIR DRESS AND IT'S JUST ADDED INFORMATION AND MAKES FOR A MORE TRANSPARENT PROCESS, AND I THINK THAT'S ALWAYS A GOOD THING. THANK YOU.
02:30:37.756: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD?
02:30:40.692: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD:  WE HAVE HEARD SOME COMMENTS TONIGHT ABOUT THE LACK OF PUBLIC COMMENT PERIODS, AND I WT TO RIND MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 7TH, SO OUR NEXT REGULARLY SCHEDULED MEETING WILL BE TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 8TH, WHICH WILL HAVE A PUBLIC COMMENT COMPONENT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE MEETING. IN ADDITION, CAUCUS WILL BE ON SUNDAY, AUGUST 30TH, AND WE ARE HAVING IT A WEEK EARLY SO THAT WEON'T INTFERE WITH THE LABOR DAY WEENAND THE FT THATE ARE NOT HAVING A MEETING ON MONDAY NIGHT. SENDING, THE MOBILITY COMMITTEE, ACCORDING TO AN EMAIL FROM STAFF, THE FIRST MEETING WILL BE THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 3RD AT 4:00 P.M., AND I WILL BE BRINGING FORWARD A DRAFT RESOLUTION ABOUT PUBLIC COMMENT AND CIVITY. WH I WAS ON THE SCHOOL BOARD, WE WORKED ON A COMMENT, AND I THINK THAT THE COUNCILMEMBER BASHING THAT OCCURS DURING PUBLIC COMMENT TIME, RATHER THAN TALKING ABOUT IMPORTANT POLICY ISSUES, IS TOTALLY INAPPROPRIATE AND SETS THE WRONG TO. WE ARE BETTER THAN THAT, AND WE CAN RISE TO A LEVEL AT LEAST EQUAL TO THE SCHOOL BOARD. THANK YOU.
02:32:01.439: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
02:32:04.809: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. CAN I SEE MS. -- MS. CELL IS STILL ON -- HER ICON IS STILL UP HERE. I JUST WANTED TO ENCOURAGE HER TO -- I KNOW SHE'S GOING TO DO MOVING FORRDGAIN, TH OJEC DECISI, AND I ASSUME THAT THAT'S GOING TO ALSO ENTAIL PERHAPS REOPENING THE COMMENTS FOR NOT JUST STAFF BUT FOR THE PUBLIC FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME, SO I'M INTERESTED IN THAT. I JUST WANTED TO SAY I DIDN'T KNOW IF THAT WAS MENTIONED FULLY, THAT I THINK WE SHOULD DO THAT. SO, JUST A COUPLE OF THINGS REAL QUICK. I WANTED TO THANK MR. STORY FOR CALLING IN,ND I AUALL WENT BACK AND LISNED TO WHAT I SAID ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN CALIFORNIA AND TURNING OFF THE WATER AND POWER TO THESE HOUSES, AND IT WAS DIFFICULT TO HEAR WHAT I SAID, SO MY APOLOGIES FOR THAT, AND WE ARE WORKING WITH IT, AND I HAVE A NEW SYSTEM HERE, AND IT SEEMS TO BE WORKING BETTER, SO I THANK YOU FOR SAYING THAT, AND, YOU KNOW, UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES, I MIGHT RUN INTO HIMOWOWN OR SOTHING AFTER AONDA MEETING, AND WE'D HAVE A NICE TALK. SO, I WH THOSE DAYS WOULD COME BACK SOON. I HAD THE PLEASURE OF DOING A SMART ART INSTALLATION JOB FOR A NEW TENANT AT LURIE TERRACE TODAY, AND SO I WAS AT LURIE TERRACE, AND I'M JUST REALLY HAPPY WITH WHAT WE DID THERE. AND I HOP THAT EVERYTHING CONTINUES TO GO SMOOTHLY THERE, AND THEY ARE DECENT PLACES. THEY ARE AFFORDABLE FOR THESE FOLKS, AND SHE WAS THRILLED TO BE ABLE TO FIND A PLACE HERE AND LEARN THAT WE AS A BODY, WORKING WITH OUR SUPPORTERS HERE IN THE COMMUNITY ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE THAT AS AECENT PLACFOR SENISO FIND AFFORDABLEHOUSING, AND IT WAS VERY NICE TO BE IN THERE, AND I HADN'T BEEN IN THERE IN MANY, MANY YEARS AGO, KIND OF TAKING A LOOK AROUND AGAIN, SEEING WHAT THEY ARE LIKE, AND THAT WAS A GOOD PURCHASE. WE DID A GOOD THING THERE. I ALSO WANTED TO SHARE MY CONDOLENCES AND SYMPATHIES TO ALL OF THE FOLKS IN CALIFORNIA, WITH ALL OF THE EMERGENCY RVICESEOPLE AND T SMOKE JUMPERS AND TREE HUGGERS AND ENVIRONMENTALISTS AND NATURE LOVERS AND FOREST AND WATER STEWARDS, AND I AM SO SORRY THAT CALIFORNIA IS BURNING RIGHT NOW. I CAN'T EVEN TELL YOU HOW DEVASTATING IT IS TO SEE THIS. I HAVE BEEN WATCHING SOME DRIVER THRUS OF THE HENNESSY FIRE UP THERE IN NAPA VALLEY AND SO ON. IT REALLY IS TRAGEOUS, AND WE HAVE GOT TGET ITOGHER AS A PLANET. THERE IS NO PROGRESS WITUT HOPE. I THINK WE HEARD THAT LECTURE A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO, AND IT IS TRUE, BUT, MAN, IT REALLY SEEMS HOPELESS SOMETIMES WHEN WE SEE THIS FOOTAGE, AND I AM REALLY DISTRAUGHT WITH THAT, WITH MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY IN CALIFORNIA AND THE TREES AND WILDLIFE AND THE COMMUNITY. MY HEART GOES TO ERYE OUT THERE. IT'S TRAGIC. I JUST WANTED TO COMMENT REAL QUICK ON RULES. SOME OF THE WORST THINGS COME OUT WHEN OUR RULES AREN'T FOLLOWED. YOU KNOW, WHEN WE ARE SPEAKING TO OR SUPPOSED TO BE SPEAKING TO A -- YOU KNOW, TWO OR THREE DOWN IN AMENDING A RESOLUTION, AND INSTEAD WERE ACCUSINGTHER AND ASSUMING PRESUMPTION OF INTENT OF OUR COLLEAGUES, AND SAYING THAT WE ARE ACTING FOOLISHLY OR WHAT WE ARE PRETENDING OR THAT WE HAVE THEORIES ABOUT THINGS AND NOT FACTS AND SO ON, AND WHEN THIS IS ALLOWED TO GO ON UNDER OUR RULES AND WE ARE NOT SPEAKING TO THE NOTION AND T MOTION BORE US, THINK WHAT HAPPENS IS IT GIVES FREE REIN FOR PEOPLE TO ARGUE, IT GIVES FREE REIN FOR PEOPLE TO INSULT, AND IT DRAGS OUT OUR MEETINGS AND WE DON'T MAKE GOOD DECISIONS. AND SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE US TO STICK TO THE RULES AND SPEAK TO THE MATTERS BEFORE US WHEN THEY ARE BEFORE US, AND, YOU KNOW, AND THERUTH OF IT IS I'M GOING TO DEFEND MY COLLEAGUES, COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER, AND TO THINK THAT IT IS ANY OTHER WAY IS TO BE FOOLISH ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS HERE IN CITY COUNCIL. I FULLY ADMIT THAT I'M NOT A GOOD POLITICIAN, BECAUSE WHAT I SEE FROM POLITICIAN IS SMILE AND WAVE HERE AND DO SOMETHING ELSE OVER HERE. I SEE A LOT OF THIS GOING ON IN THE COMMUNITY, A LOT OF PRETENDING, A LOT OF PRETENSE, AND YEAH, I'M NOT UP FORAT. AND, YOUNOW, OBVIOUSLY, COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER ISN'T HERE, AND SHE SAYS WHAT SHE WANTS TO SAY, AND I ADMIRE HER FOR THAT. AS FAR AS HER REMARKS ABOUT STICKING WITH THE PLAN, THE PLAN IS WE HAVE A COMPETENT WORKING TEMPORARY ADMINISTRATOR, AND I WOULD BE HAPPY TO EXTEND EVEN A TEORARY CONTRA FOR HIM TO GO ON WHILE WE SEARCHO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE RIGHT PLACE IN PERSON. SO WHEN SHE MADE THOSE REMARKS, I DON'T THINK THAT'S UNUSUAL AT ALL, AND I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY KIND OF SCHEMING OR PLANNING GOING ON AROUND THAT, AND IT DOESN'T BOTHER ME THAT SHE SAID THAT, WHATSOEVER. SO I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT, AND SO I'M HAPPY THAVE SERVED WH HER FOR THESE COUPLE OF YEARS, AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS, AND I'M SORRY SHE WON'T BE SITTING NEXT TO ME AGAIN. THANK YOU.
02:37:29.467: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
02:37:30.401: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. FIRST, COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, I'M REALLY GLAD THAT YOU GOT TO GO TO LURIE TERRACE AND SEE THE REAL HUMAN IMPACT OF IT. I REMEMBER AFTER THE RENATION OF MLER MANOR, WHEN WE RE ALL INVITED IN TO SEE THE SOLAR PANELS AND EAT LUNCH AND DESSERT WITH THE RESIDENTS THERE, IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY, AND, OBVIOUSLY, BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC, WE NEED TO POSTPONE ANYTHING LIKE THAT, WERE IT TO EVER BE PROPER AT LURIE TERRACE, BUT I'M GLAD THAT YOU GOT A DOSE THAT I WL SAY IT IS LITTLE FRUSTRATINTO HEAR IN ONE BREATH LIKE THE COMMENTS THAT IT IS BAD THAT WE GO IN WITH ASSUMPTIONS OF ILL WILL OR BAD INTENT, THAT THAT'S THE KIND OF NEGATIVE CONVERSATION THAT COMES OUT OF DISCUSSIONS OF AMENDMENTS ON AMENDMENTS, AND THEN AT THE SAME TIME LENDREDIBILITY TO AND GIVE VOICE TO ACCUSATIONS OF US WANTING A BAD CITY ADMINISTRATOR SO THAT WE CAN BE CORRUPT. THAT FEELS LIKE, YOU KNOW, SAYING ONE THING AND DOING ANOTHER. SO, I'LL ALSO JUST SAY I THINK THERE ARE -- I DON'T KNOW WHY, BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF THEORIES RIGHT NOW GOING AROUND ABOUT PEOPLE PULLING STRINGS BEHIND THE SCENES TO GET PEOPLE TO ADVOCATE FOR BEING ALLOWED TO GIVE INPUT ABOUT THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR SEARCH, AND I JUST DID A QUICK KEYWORD SEARCH THROUGH OUR EMAIL IN-BOX, AND I DIDN'T READ A SINGLE FO EMAIL OR COPY A PASTE, SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE COLLEAGUES TO READ THROUGH THE EMAILS FROM OUR RESIDENTS, AND I THINK YOU'LL FIND DIFFERENT SENTIMENTS AND DIFFERENT MOTIVES FROM EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM.
02:39:24.449: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER SMITH?
02:39:29.987: >> COUNCILMEERMITH: N M CLOSE TOIVE YEARS ON THIS BO, I HAVE WORKED VERY HARD TO MAINTAIN A CIVIL TONE AND A WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH THOSE
