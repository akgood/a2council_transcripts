00:08:24.809: >> GOOD EVENING, THIS IS TOM CALLING FROM LOWER TOWN IN ANN ARBOR. I'M HAPPY TO SEE THAT YOU HAVE ON YOUR AGENDA THE RECONSIDERATION OF THE AMENDMENTS TO MODIFY THE HOME OCCUPATION REGULATIONS, THANK YOU FOR LISTENING TO THE MANY CALLERS AND PEOPLE WHO HAVE WRITTEN YOU ON THAT ITEM. I WANT TO REFER BACK TO SOMETHING YOU'VE BEEN DISCUSSING RECENTLY A LOT WHICH WAS THE TC1 TRANSIT CORRIDOR ZONING AND THAT DOVE TAILS INTO THE DISCUSSION TONIGHT WHICH SHOULD BE QUITE INTERESTING TO LISTEN TO. SOMETHING I'VE SAID A LOT Y KNOW YOU'VE MAYBE HEARD A LOT, IS THAT THE PROCESS IS IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY BECAUSE ZONING IS LAW. SOMETHING THAT I NOTED IN YOUR DISCUSSIONS THERE AS YOU KNOW FOR A LONG TIME BEEN IN FAVOR OF TRANSIT CORRIDOR ZONING. I WOULD NOT HAVE ENVISIONED IT HAD EXACT SAME WAY THAT YOU HAVE, BUT I'M GLAD YOU'RE MOVING FORWARD WITH SOMETHING AND THERE'S DISCUSSIONS THAT HAVE BEEN ILLUMINATING. BOTH BRETT AND ALEXIS WERE TRYING TO HELP STEER YOU IN THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE MASTER PLAN AND THE ZONING ORDINANCE AND TIE THINGS MORE DIRECTLY AN INTENSE STATEMENT AND SOME OF THE OTHER PEOPLE FROM THE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE MIGHT NOT BE UP ON WHAT HAPPENED AT THUS MOST RECENT PLANNING COMMISSION MEETING. IN SORT HAD, I THINK THAT WAS AN IMPORTANT CONNECTION THAT YOU MIGHT THINK ABOUT AGAIN THE NEXT TIME OR GOING FORWARD THAT ZONING NEEDS TO BE LEGALLY DEFENSIBLE. SO THAT'S REALLY WHAT THEIR WERE HEADED FOR AND I COULD SEE WHY THEY WERE WANTING TO DO IT THAT WAY. THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I KEEP TALKING ABOUT THE PROCESS. IF WE TALK ABOUT THE PROCESS, THE RESULTING PLANS AND ORDINANCES ARE MORE DEFENSIBLE IF CHALLENGED AND IF WE DON'T FOLLOW THOSE, THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE. WE EXPOSE OURSELVES TO LEGAL CHALLENGES AND EVEN INVITE THEM WE WORSEN OR ODDS OF SUCCESSFULLY DEFENDING THOSE CHALLENGES.  SO, I THINK THE ADVICE THAT YOU WERE GIVEN THERE WAS QUITE WISE IN TERMS OF MAKING THAT LEGALLY DEFENSIBLE. HOPEFULLY YOU'LL THINK ABOUT THAT GOING FORWARD WITH THIS AND OTHER ISSUES. I ADID MENTION CAMPUS BUSINESS ZONING AGAIN SO I'M GOING TO HAVE TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THAT BECAUSE THAT WAS AN ISSUE THAT WAS A PROBLEM ATTIC AND IT STILL HANGS OUR THERE AS PROBLEMATIC -
00:10:54.225: >> 30 MORE SECONDS.
00:10:56.661: >> TRANSPORTATION IN PARTICULAR LOWER TOWN MASTER PLAN FOR SERVANT VILLAGE, WE HAVE AN ALL RESIDENTIAL 99 POINT WHATEVER PERCENT AND WE VALLATE OF CONDOS WHERE PEOPLE COULD HAVE GOTTEN OUT OF THEIR CARS IF WE HAD SOMETHING TO GO TO. NOT JUST THE NEW THOUSAND RESIDENTS BUT THE EXISTING RESIDENTS COULD HAVE DRIVEN A LOT LESS VEHICLE MILES AND PERHAPS OWNED A LOT LESS VEHICLES IF WE HAD THAT TYPO MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT.  SO GOING FORWARD - -

00:19:53.798: >> THANK YOU, MADAM CHAIR.  MY NAME IS ELI COOPER, I'M THE CITY'S TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM MANAGER AND I'M GOING TO DO VERY BRIEF INTRODUCTION RECOGNIZING THERE'S A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME. I WANT TO NOTE AND THANK THE COMMUNITY. I'VE BEEN WITH THE CITY 16 YEARS NEXT WEEK AND THIS WILL BE THE FOURTH TRANSPORTATION PLAN ADOPTION I HAVE PARTICIPATED IN. I RECALL BACK TO 2005-2006 WHEN I STARTED, WE BEGAN WITH A CITY'S FIRST COMPREHENSIVE NON-MOTORIZED TRANSPORT TRANSPORTATION PLAN AND WE'VE MADE A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE OVER THE PAST DECADE AND A HALF. AND I REALLY JUST WANTED TO SET THAT STAGE TO HIGHLIGHT FROM THE CONSULTING TEAM TO INTRODUCE THE MOVING TOGETHER FORWARD TOWARDS VISION ZERO WHICH WILL BE OUR FIRST VISION ZERO PLAN. WHEREAS IN THE BEGINNING PART OF THE 21ST CENTURY WE BEGAN TO LOOK AT ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION, WE'RE NOW CHANGING OUR FOCUS, WE'RE STILL ABSOLUTELY FOCUSED ON ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION BUT THE ISSUE OF SAFE SAFETY IS COMING TO THE FORE. ON BEHALF OF STAFF AND THE TEAM I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS AFTER BUT I'LL NOW TURN IT TO STACEY WHO WILL WALK YOU THROUGH OUR FORMAL PRESENTATION ABOUT THE WORK THAT WE'RE BRINGING FORWARD FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU.
00:21:29.493: >> THANKS, ELI. GOOD EVENING, COMMISSIONERS, IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU ALL AGAIN. SO WHAT I HAVE FOR YOU TONIGHT IS A VERY BRIEF PRESENTATION AS YOU HAVE ALL SEEN THE PLAN BEFORE AND WE PRESENTED IT BACK IN DECEMBER IN THE FALL BUT FOR THE PUBLIC'S SAKE I'M GOING TO GO THROUGH A HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW OF THE PROCESS WE WENT THROUGH, TALK ABOUT THE DOCUMENT ITSELF AND HOW IT'S STRUCTURED, SOME KEY PLAN UPDATE WE HAVE CONDUCTED SINCE THE LAST DRAFT, AND SOME ADDITIONAL RECOMMEND UPDATE WE HAVE SINCE A FEW MORE CONVERSATIONS IN RECENT DAYS, AND THEN ANTICIPATED NEXT STEPS THE PROCESS KIND OF IN A NUT SHELL BROKE DOWN INTO THREE PHASES. THE FIRST WAS OUR DISCOVERY PHASE [BREATH ON MICROPHONE] AROUND TRANSPORTATION IN ANN ARBOR. AND WE WERE ALSO TRUEING TO IDENTIFY A SET OF VALUES AND GOALS OF THE COMMUNITY THAT THE COMMUNITY HOLDS DEAR TO GUIDE DECISION-MAKING AND THE STRATEGIES THAT WOULD REALLY EMBODY THE PLAN. THE NEXT PHASE WAS OUR IDEATION PHASE, WHICH IS WHERE WE ARE ALL OF THE PAUL ESES AND PROGRAMS THAT WILL HELP THE CITY ACHIEVE THE GOALS AND VALUES THAT WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE DISCOVERY PHASE. IN THAT PHASE WE ARE LOOKING TO OTHER COMMUNITIES TO SEE WHAT WORKS THERE, AND WE DO A LOT OF OUTREACH AND DISCUSSION WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND THE PUBLIC TO SEE WHAT THE COMMUNITY WANTED TO SEE HAPPEN IN ANN ARBOR.  THEN FINALLY THE ACTION PLANNING PHASE WHERE WE REFINE THAT LONG LIST OF PROJECTS PROGRAMS AND POLICIES INTO A SET OF STRATEGIES THAT ARE ORGANIZED BY PRIORITY AND TIMELINE, ESTIMATED COSTS AND RESOURCES SO THAT WE CAN ENSURE THAT THE PLAN IS IMPLEMENTABLE. THROUGH ALL THOSE PHASES WE DID A LOT OF PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT. WE HAD REALLY GREAT INPUT FROM THE COMMUNITY THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS, AND THAT REALLY IS A TESTAMENT TO HOW THE PLAN IS TODAY. IT WAS A REALLY COMMUNITY-DRIVEN PROCESS MORE SO THAN MANY THAT I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN. IN THAT DISCOVERY PHASE, AGAIN WE WERE LOOKING TO UNDERSTAND HOW PEOPLE GET AROUND TODAY, WHAT IS TRANSPORTATION LIKE IN ANN ARBOR. SO WE KICKED IT OFF WITH A TRANSPORTATION BEHAVIOR SURVEY AND GOT IMMEDIATELY OVER 1500 RESPONSES WITHIN A COUPLE OF DAYS AND ALL TOLD OVER 1800 RESPONSES TO THAT SURVEY. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HEARD EARLY ON WAS THAT THE COMMUNITY REALLY WANTED TO SEE A NETWORK THAT WAS, A NETWORK THAT WAS COMFORTABLE FOR ALL AGES AND ABILITIES AND SO WE WANTED TO SET THE GROUNDWORK, THE GROUND BASELINE OF, YOU KNOW, HOW COMFORTABLE IS IT TODAY. SO WE FOLLOWED UP THAT ORIGINAL SURVEY AN ONLINE SURVEY ASKING PEOPLE ABOUT THEIR LEVEL OF COMFORT, BASICALLY. AND HAD OVER A DOZEN RESPONSES TO THAT ONE AS WELL. WE DID A TRADITIONAL OPEN HOUSE - - AND SOME POP-UP MEETINGS THAT WERE AROUND THE SAME TIME FOCUSED ON THE SAME QUESTIONS THAT WE WERE ASKING THE PUBLIC, AND A SERIES OF FOCUS GROUPS SO THAT WE COULD HAVE MORE, A SMALL GROUP DISCUSSION MORE IN DEPTH AROUND CERTAIN ISSUES. THEN NEXT IN THE IDEATION PHASE, AGAIN WE HAD ANOTHER TRADITIONAL OPEN HOUSE. WE HAD AN ONLINE SURVEY THAT FOCUSED ON CORRIDORS THAT WE HAD IDENTIFIED AS BEING SAFETY CONCERNS BASED ON THE CRASH DATA ANALYSIS THAT WE DID. I SHOULD MENTION IN THE DISCOVERY PHASE YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING IN THE BACKGROUND IS A LOT OF DATA CRUNCHING AND UNDERSTANDING BOTH HOW PEOPLE ARE GETTING AROUND, BUT ALSO WHAT IS THE SAFETY ENVIRONMENT FOR TRANSPORTATION IN ANN ARBOR. IN THE IDEATION PHASE RESPONDING TO SOME OF WHAT WE HEARD IN THE DISCOVERY PHASE WE SUBMITTED, WE SET OUT A PEDESTRIAN CROSSINGS SISK SURVEY AND HAD ALMOST A THOUSAND RESPONSES TO THAT AS WELL. FOLLOWING UP ON THE BICYCLE LEVEL OF COMFORT SURVEY WE DEVELOPED A DRAFT ALL AGES AND ABILITIES NETWORK, PUT THAT ONLINE, AND ASKED FOR YOUR FEEDBACK AND GOT OVER 3500 COMMENTS ON THAT. IN THE ACTION PLANNING PHASE WE HELD A VIRTUAL PUBLIC OPEN HOUSE AND THEN HAD. AN OVERVIEW OF WHAT THE DOCUMENT LOOKS LIKE, I'M SURE THAT YOU ALL HAVE HAD A CHANCE TO SEE IT. IT LAYS OUT IN THESE SEVEN MAIN SECTIONS. FIRST THE INTRODUCTION WHERE WE'RE SETTING THE STAGE FOR WHAT THE PLAN IS AND WHERE IT CAME FROM. SECTION TWO COVERS THE MOBILITY IN ANN ARBOR AS IT IS TODAY, AND SECTION THREE REPORTS BACK ON THE MOBILITY VALUES AND GOALS WE HEARD FROM THE COMMUNITY. SECTION FOUR IS REALLY THE BULK OF THE PLAN AND THAT ADDRESSES ALL OF THE STRATEGIES THAT THE COMMUNITY VALUES WOULD LIKE TO SEE AND THAT WE BROUGHT TO THE TABLE TO ADDRESS THE SAFE SAFETY CONCERNS AND THE MOBILITY VALUES AND GOALS SET FORTH BY THE COMMUNITY. SECTION 5, THEN, TAKES SOME OF THOSE STRATEGIES AND DEVELOPS SOME CONCEPTUAL DESIGNS FOR WHAT THAT COULD LOOK LIKE ON THE STREETS OF ANN ARBOR, AND THEN SECTION SIX IS HOW DO WE MAKE IT ALL HAPPEN. SO THAT'S WHERE WE APPLY COST ESTIMATES, TIMELINES, AND PROJECTED OUT RESOURCES SO THAT THE CITY CAN HELP, SO THE CITY CAN PLAN AND ASSIGN THEIR RESOURCES APPROPRIATELY. THEN FINALLY, WE ADDED A GLOSSARY AND SOME ACRONYMS, AN ACRONYM GUIDE SO THAT PEOPLE CAN MORE EASILY READ THROUGH THE PLAN AND UNDERSTAND ANY TERMS THAT THEY'RE NOT FAMILIAR WITH. SO JUST FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO MAY NOT BE AS FAMILIAR WITH THE PLAN, I WANTED TO HIT JUST A COUPLE OF HIGH-LEVEL, A COUPLE ITEMS THAT AT A HIGH LEVEL. THE MOBILITY VALUES THAT WE FOUND REALLY CROWD SOURCE SAID FROM THE COMMUNITY AS ELI ALREADY MENTIONED THIS IS A ZERO VISION PLAN THAT WAS KIND OF THE DIRECTIVE THAT WE WERE GIVEN COMING INTO THIS, AND THE COMMUNITY REALLY SUPPORTED IT. SAFETY WAS BY FAR THE HIGHEST RATED MOBILITY VALUE AMONG THE PUBLIC AND THE STAKEHOLDERS. BUT WASN'T THE ONLY THING THAT WAS IMPORTANT. OTHER VALUES THAT ROSE TO THE TOP INCLUDED MOBILITY, ACCESSIBILITY FOR ALL, HEALTHY PEOPLE A SUSTAINABLE PLACES. AND REGIONAL CONNECTITY. A. THE OVERARCHING GOALS THAT DROVE THE PLAN WERE THAT THE CITY WANTS TO MOVE TOWARDS ZERO DEATHS AND ZERO EMISSIONS. THESE ARE SOME PRETTY CLEAR DIRECTIVES WE GOT FROM THE COMMUNITY. AS I MENTIONED, THE BULK OF THE PLAN IS SECTION FOUR, WHERE WE OUTLINE ALL OF THE STRATEGIES THAT WILL HELP THE CITY ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS. IN TOTAL THERE ARE 76 STRATEGIES THAT ARE ALL INCLUDED IN A MATRIX AT THE BACK OF THAT SECTION. THE MAJORITY OF THAT SECTION INCLUDES 22 KEY STRATEGIES THAT GO INTO A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL ABOUT WHAT THE CURRENT STATE IS WITH RESPECT TO THAT STRATEGY, AND WHAT THE ACTUAL RECOMMENDATION IS. ALL STRATEGIES SPEAK TO HOW THAT STRATEGY RELATES TO THE VALUES. A LOT OF THE STRATEGIES CROSS-CUT MULTIPLE VALUES SO YOU'LL SEE MORE THAN ONE VALUE FOR EACH STRATEGY. EACH STRATEGY ALSO OUTLINES THE DISCIPLINES THAT ARE GETTING TO ZERO FATALITIES AND SERIOUS INJURIES TAKES MORE THAN JUST INFRASTRUCTURE. IT TAKES INFRASTRUCTURE CHANGES, IT TAKES EDUCATION, ENCOURAGEMENT, ENFORCEMENT, ADDRESSING EQUITY, AND EVALUATION. SO WITH EACH STRATEGY WE DENOTE HOW, WHAT IS INVOLVED IN THAT STRATEGY AND HOW ALL OF THOSE ARE BEING COVERED. WE ALSO COVER THE CROSS-AGENCY AND CROSS-DEPARTMENTAL COLLABORATION BY ASSIGNING THE KEY DEPARTMENTS OR AGENCIES THAT IMPORTANT TO IMPLEMENTING THAT STRATEGY, AND THEN LAYING THAT OUT IN A TIME-BASED ACTION STRATEGY IN SHORT, MEDIUM, AND LONG-TERM. AND FINALLY, ACCOUNTABILITY. EACH STRATEGY INCLUDES TARGETS SO THAT THE COMMUNITY CAN HOLD ITSELF ACCOUNTABLE. KEY PLAN UPDATE IS THE LAST DRAFT INCLUDE REVISIONS TO THE BIKE MAP. SOME OF THOSE REVISIONS WERE JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE BEING CONSISTENT AND THE MAP IS CLEAN, BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT WE ALSO DID ADD NEWPORT ROAD AS A RECOMMENDED BIKE ROUTE AND WE SPECIFICALLY DEFINED ROUTES THAT WERE DEPICTING BORDER TO BORDER TRAIL CONNECTIONS THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN MISSING OR JUST MISCLASSIFIED IN SOME CASES. WE MADE SOME REFINEMENTS TO THE TRANSIT CORRIDORS MAP BASED ON FEEDBACK FROM TRIPLE ATA AND A REFINEMENT TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD MAP FOR PARK ACCESS.  BOTH OF THOSE REFINEMENTS WERE REALLY MORE GRAPHICAL, THEY DIDN'T REALLY HAVE ANY SUBSTANTIVE CHANGE TO THE PLAN THAT THE STRATEGY RECOMMENDED. WE ALSO ADDED SOME LANGUAGE IN A COUPLE OF CASES FOR CLARITY IN STRATEGY SIX ON THE BIKE ROUTES WE ADDED A DISCUSSION OF THE IMPORTANCE A CAMPUS TO CAMPUS CONNECTION, END OF THE PLANNING LEVEL NATURE OF THE CORRIDORS, MEANING THAT THICKS MAY CHANGE AS THE STAFF GOES TO IMPLEMENT AND MAYBE SOME 067 THE OF THE CORRIDORS THAT ARE IDENTIFIED ARE MIGHT NEED TO BE TWEAKED OR REVISED. AND THEN IN STRATEGY 10, WHICH IS TRANSIT SERVICE, WE ADDED LANGUAGE ABOUT TRANSIT SERVICE DEMAND ALSO BEING PART OF WHAT WILL DICTATE THE FREQUENCY OF EXISTING SERVICE FIXED ROUTE SERVICE. THERE WERE SOME COMPONENTS THAT WERE ADDED, THE GLOSSARY AND PARTNER ACRONYM REFERENCE THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER IS NEW, AND AN ACKNOWLEDGMENTS PAGE HAD NOT MADE IT INTO THE LAST DRAFT EITHER. AND WE ADDED THREE APPENDIXES, APPENDIX B THAT ARE PRESENT THROUGHOUT THE PLAN, BUT THIS IS JUST ADDED FOR FRAME OF REFERENCE.  WE ALSO ADDED RELEVANT MAPS FROM THE 2013 NON-MOTORIZED TRANSPORTATION PLAN. WE ADDED AN APPENDIX TO SUMMARIZE ALL THE PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT DONE THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS. AND FINALLY AN AN APPENDIX THAT DETAILS THE METHODOLOGIES OF OUR ANALYSES. I MENTIONED AT THE BEGINNING THAT THERE ARE SOME ADDITIONAL UPDATE RECOMMENDED BY STAFF AND I'LL JUST GO THROUGH THOSE QUICKLY RIGHT NOW. THE FOLLOWING LANGUAGE WILL BE ADDED TO THE DOCUMENT MAKING A STRONGER CONNECTION BETWEEN DISTRACTED DRIVING, AND RECKLESS DRIVING IN STRATEGY TWO WHICH IS ADDRESSING DANGEROUS BEHAVIORS. WE WOULD LIKE TO ADD TO AN ADDITIONAL ACTION ITEM ADDRESSING ROADWAY RECONFIGURATIONS ON MDOT ROADWAYS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT TOOL, WHICH IS ALSO IN STRATEGY TWO. WE WOULD LIKE TO MODIFY LANGUAGE IN STRATEGY SIX WHICH IS BIKE ROUTES TO CLARIFY THAT THE ROUTES NEED TO BE CONTINUOUS IN ORDER TO CREATE A FULL ALL AGES AND ABILITIES NETWORK. AND ALSO IN STRATEGY SIX DENOTING THE IMPORTANCE OF ALL STREET PATHS AND THE BORDER TO BORDER TRAIL SPECIFICALLY. WE WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT APPENDIX B PROJECT LISTS WILL BE MODIFIED TO INCLUDE THE LIST OF THE FOCUS CORRIDORS AND INTERSECTIONS. ANTICIPATED NEXT STEPS WOULD BE A COUNCIL WORK SESSION AND WE ALWAYS WANT TO BE LOOKING FORWARD TO IMPLEMENTATION.  SO SOME OF THE VERY FIRST IMPLEMENTATION STEPS WOULD BE TO DESIGNATE A VISION ZERO CITIZEN ADVISORY BOARD AND START TO ESTABLISH A LIST OF PROJECTS THAT WILL ADDRESS THE PLAN PRIORITYIES. THAT'S ALL I HAVE.
00:36:19.849: >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WAS THERE ANY OTHER STAFF. MR. LEONARD.

PART OF THE JACKSON HURON NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATION WE START AT MAPLE AND JACKSON BY THE PARK IF YOU CAN PICTURE THAT, JACKSON AND MAPLE BY VETERANS PARK, AND WE GO ALL THE WAY TO HURON AND MAINE STREET. WE WERE FORMED IN 1998, WE WERE EARL Y TO THE TABLE WITH TRAFFIC CALMING UNDER MAYOR SHELDON, JOHN BECAME MAYOR, AND WE WERE ABLE TO WORK WITH MDOT AND HAVE JACKSON AVENUE FROM MAPLE AND JACKSON AT VETS PARK TO RIVENA WHERE DEXTER AND JACKSON MERGED TO HURON THEY WERE ABLE TO CONVERT THAT TO THREE LANES. THAT WAS IN 2007. SINCE THEN WE'VE HAD A COUPLE OF CITY PLANS, 2009, AND THEN WE HAD ANOTHER NON-MOTORIZED PLAN IN 2007 AND THEN AN UPDATE IN 2013 AND SOME OUR THE JACKSON HURON CORRIDOR, WHICH DOES THIS HUGE AMOUNT OF VOLUME EVERY DAY, MAYBE IT'S LESS NOW DURING COVID, BUT DOES THIS HUGE AMOUNT OF VOLUME IS A MAIN THOROUGHFARE FOR THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR, IT IS STILL IS NOT EVEN MENTIONED IN THIS NEW VISION ZERO PLAN. UNFORTUNATELY OUR DATA DIDN'T GET SUBMITTED INTO THE PACKET FOR TONIGHT'S MEETING SO I HAD TO DO A LATE INSERTION LIKE AT 2 O'CLOCK THIS AFTERNOON, HOPEFULLY IT MADE IT. WE'RE PUTTING TOGETHER A VISION ZERO PLAN FOR THE JACKSON HURON CORRIDOR BUT I QUICKLY WANT TO SAY BEFORE MY TIME ENDS I HEARD THE YOUNG LADY. AND HEY, KUDOS TO THIS VISION ZERO PLAN.  THIS IS GREAT.  JUST MAKE SURE YOU LOOK AT ALL THE NEIGHBORHOODS AND WE'RE A BIG NEIGHBORHOOD HERE.  WE'RE A CORRIDOR. WE TALKED ABOUT GOALS AND VALUES SO I WONDER WHAT THE GOALS AND VALUES WOULD BE FOR HURON STREET. I ALSO HEARD THEM SAY, AND THIS IS WHAT WE'VE HEARD FOR 23 YEARS, IT'S THE CRASH DATA ANALYSIS AND THE SAFETY ANALYSIS AND WHETHER IT'S TRUE OR NOT, I GUESS PEOPLE AREN'T DYING ON THE JACKSON HURON STREET - -
00:41:18.181: >> 30 MORE SECONDS.
00:41:19.849: >> YET. AT LEAST THEY'RE NOT DYING YET. SO WE WANT TO JUST BRING A HUMAN ELEMENT TO THE JACKSON-HURON NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATION AND THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY. THANK YOU.
00:41:32.629: >> THANK YOU. EN LL WITTHE PNE NUMBER ENDG WH 7. CAER WITTHE PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 741. YOU CAN UNMUTE YOUR PHONE WITH STAR 6 AND ADDRESS THE COMMISSIONS.
00:41:50.914: >> HELLO, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
00:41:51.681: >> WE CAN, GO AHEAD.
00:41:53.049: >> MY NAME IS LARRY DECK, I LIVE AT 3050 LORAIN STREET IN ANN ARBOR.  I'M ON THE BOARD OF THE WASHTENAW BICYCLING AND WALKING COALITION BUT I'M SPEAKING TONIGHT AS AN INDIVIDUAL BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T HAD TIME TO CHANGE TO THE APRIL DRAFT. FIRST, WE'RE VERY PLEASED WITH THE OVERALL PLANNING PROCESS HERE.  I THINK STAFF AND CONSULTANTS HAVE DONE A GREAT JOB ON THE PROJECT, AND APPRECIATE THEIR INVOLVEMENT WITH THE COMMUNITY AND THEIR RESPONSIVENESS TO SUGGESTIONS. W WWBC'S COMMENTS IN EARLY MARCH SUGGESTED SEVEN MAIN MODIFICATIONS, FAIRLY MINOR MODIFICATIONS. I THINK FOUR OF THOSE WERE HANDLED WELL INTO THE APRIL DRAFT SO WE'RE PLEASED WITH THE WAY THAT HAPPENED. THERE WERE THREE REMAINING ONES WHICH I DIDN'T THINK WERE ADEQUATELY ADDRESSED BUT FROM STACEY'S COMMENTS EARLIER TODAY THEY MAY BE BEING ADDRESSED AND TAKEN CARE OF. THEY REALLY DID THE DISTRACTED DRIVING, MAKING SURE THAT WE RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT IS AN ISSUE AND RELATION TO DEVICE ISSUES, BICYCLE FACILITY CONTINUITY WHICH IS AN IMPORTANT THING THAT WE ASK TO BE INCLUDED. WASN'T IN APRIL, BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE IT MAY BE BEING ADDED NO AND THE BORDER TO BORDER TRAIL WASN'T TALKED ABOUT MUCH IN THE EARLIER DRAFT. SYSTEM IN ANN ARBOR CAN BE FELT WE APPRECIATE THAT.  AND THE THING THAT WAS REMAINING FROM FOR US ON THAT WAS SOME RECOGNITION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THE B2B TRAIL AND THE IMPORTANCE TO THE DAUNT NEWTY AND THE INTEGRITY OF THE MOTORIZED SYSTEM IN ANN ARBOR AND THE COUNTY. IT SOUNDS LIKE THE CITY MAY BE ADDRESSING THAT TOO. WE'LL SEE HOW THE FINAL CHANGES COME, BUT IF STACEY'S COMMENTS ARE ANY INDICATION, IT SOUNDSES LIKE THE STAFF IS BEING VERY RESPONSIVE TO OUR CONCERNS. APPRECIATE THAT. THE MATERIAL I SENT IF YOU HAVE AN E-MAIL I SENT AND TWO ATTACHED DOCUMENTS, THE EARLIER COMMENTSES OF THE WBWC HAD ON THE PLAN, A ONE-PAGE DOCUMENT ON THESE THINGS I THOUGHT OUGHT TO BE ADDRESSED AND IT SOUNDS LIKE THOSE MAY BE BEING ADDRESSED. YOU CAN CHECK WITH THE STAFF TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE. I WAS GOING TO ASK THAT YOU SEE THAT THOSE ARE ADDRESSED AND JUST MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE, AND IF THEY ARE - -
00:44:24.600: >> 30 MORE SECONDS.
00:44:25.334: >> AND WE APPRECIATE ITEM NUMBER THE OVERALL PROCESS. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE INPUT. THANK YOU.
00:44:36.479: >> THANK YOU.
00:44:40.817: >> CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 955 GO AHEAD.
00:44:45.755: >> GREETINGS COMMISSIONERS, THIS IS KIRK WESTFALL, 3505 CHARTER PLACE, JUST WANT TO ECHO MR. DECK'S COMMENT COMPLIMENTS FOR A PROCESS WELL-RUN. A COUPLE OF THINGS I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT, I SENT IN SOME FEEDBACK BACK IN NOVEMBER AND FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND IT WAS NOT ENTIRELY PROCESSED UNTIL TODAY SO I'M HOPING YOU WILL GET THAT AT SOME POINT IN YOUR PACKET. ONCE THE MAJOR THING THAT'S ALARMS ME ABOUT SOME OF THE WORDS IN THE PLAN HAS TO DO WITH LANE CONFIGURATIONS. I'M REALLY CONCERNED, I'VE BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT THIS FOR OVER A DECADE, I'M REALLY CONCERNED GIVEN WE'RE COMING OUT OF THE PAN TELEPHONE NUMBER PAN TELEPHONE NUMBERING AND MORE PEOPLE WILL BE WALKING AND DRIVING AND FROM ALL MEASURES I CAN SEE DRIVING HAS GOTTEN WORSE IN THE PAST YEAR EVEN THOUGH THERE'S BEEN FEWER CARS, PEOPLE ARE DRIVING MORE RECKLESSLY. AND I FEEL LIKE PEDESTRIAN CROSSINGS ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO PLAGUE US WITH TRAGEDY AND INJURIES. SO I WAS CONCERNED AT THAT THE PLAN AS IT'S WORDED NOW IN THE LAST DRAFT I SAW ANYWAY, IT IS SAID A STREET RECONFIGURATIONS IT SAYS IMPLEMENT ROADWAY RECONFIGURATIONS WHERE OPPORTUNITIES HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN IDENTIFIED, WHICH I THINK THERE'S ONLY A COUPLE LEFT THAT ARE IDENTIFIED IN PREVIOUS PLANS, AND THEN IT SAYS EVALUATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR LANE REDUCTIONS AND CORRIDOR RECUB INSTRUCTION PROJECTS. THOSE RECONSTRUCTION PROJECTS AS WE KNOW ARE PRETTY FAR AND FEW BETWEEN AND TAKE A VERY LONG TIME. I WOULD LOVE FOR THIS PLAN NAT TO ELIMINATE THE POSSIBILITY OF EFFECTIVELY CLOSING LANES OR CONVERTING THEM TO BIKE LANES OR WHATEVER. FOR EXAMPLE HURON PARKWAY NEAR HURON HIGH SCHOOL, STUDENTS HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY INJURED AND UNFORTUNATELY THERE WAS A DEATH THERE AT LEAST SINCE I'VE LIVED HERE. BY ALL ACCOUNTS - -
00:47:17.974: >>  30 MORE SECONDS.
00:47:20.209: >> LOOKING AT THE TRAFFIC COUNTS THAT DOES NOT NEED TO BE A FOUR-LANE ROAD AND IT'S OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL AND - - PREVIOUS INJURIES.  I THINK FLEXIBILITY IN THE PLAN FOR YOU, FOR THE COMMISSIONS AND COUNCIL TO TAKE ACTION TO DO LANE REDUCTIONS. THE OTHER AREA OF CONCERN IS ROUND ABOUTS. I FEEL LIKE BEING A VISION ZERO PLAN SHOULD ALSO BE FOCUSING ON DRIVERS EXTREMELY WELL. THANKS FOR YOUR TIME.
00:47:54.543: >> THANK YOU.
00:48:03.519: >> CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER 134. CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 134.
00:48:12.662: >> THANKS, MR. LENART. CHAIR MILLS, CHAIR KLEINMAN THIS IS KEN GARBER AGAIN. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BUG TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION WITH MY COMMENTS INSTEAD OF JUST BUGGING PLANNING COMMISSION WHICH IS PRETTY USED TO MY HARANGS. I'M GRATEFUL FOR ALL THE HARD WORK BY SO MANY PEOPLE ON THE TRANSPORTATION PLAN WHICH I'VE ONLY SKIMMED, I APOLOGIZE. FLUSH. I'D LIKE TO COMMENT ABOUT GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. I'M HAPPY WE'RE SETTING THE GOAL TO TRANSITIONING TO A CARBON NEUTRAL TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM BY 2030 BUT I DON'T SEE ANYTHING IN THE PLAN INCLUDING BETTER TRANSIT, BIKE SAFETY MEASURES, NEW SHARED MOBILITY OPTIONS, AND EVEN ROAD USER PRICING THAT GETS US ANYWHERE CLOSE.  RIGHT NOW WE'RE FAILING.  THE CITY'S TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS HAVE NOT GONE DOWN FROM 2015 LEVELS. THEY'VE BEEN AT ABOUT 360,000 METRIC TONS OF CO2 A YEAR SINCE THEN ACCORDING TO THE MOST RECENT GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY. AND THAT'S NOT BECAUSE OF MORE COMMUTERS. LOCAL TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS HAVE ALSO HELD STEADY FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS. TRANSPORTATION ACCOUNTS FOR 30 PERCENT OF OUR COMMUNITY EMISSIONS ACCORDING TO THE INVENTORY. I DON'T SEE EVS HELPING MUCH. IN IN MY VIEW THEY'LL PURR PEACH RAT THE VAST RESOURCE EXTRACTION, ENERGY CONSUMPTION, AND LAND USE LOSS. OUR GLOBAL CARBON BUDGETS STAYING AT 1.5 OR 2 DEGREES CELSIUS HEATING HAVE DWINDLED TO THE POINT THAT WE AS A SOCIETY CAN'T AFFORD THE EMBEDDED EMISSION COST OF TRANSITIONING OUR ENTIRE COMBUSTION FLEET TO ELECTRIC, NOT TO MENTION THE CAPACITY REQUIRED TO CHARGE ALL THOSE CAR BATTERIES.  INSTEAD THE MAIN FOCUS HAS TO BE ON REDUCING ENERGY USE.  WE NEED WALKING BIKING AND TRANSIT TO BECOME OUR DEFAULT MOBILITY OPTIONS. BUT JUST THE OPPOSITE SEEMS TO BE HAPPENING. THE PANDEMIC LULLED AND THAT RESET OUR THINKING ON THIS. THOSE OF US WHO BIKE ANN ARBOR STREETS KNOW THAT PERSONAL VEHICLES SEEMINGLY DOMINATED BY SUVS AND TRUCKS ARE BACK IN FORCE. OR MAYBE IT'S JUST BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE DRIVING MORE RECKLESSLIES A MR. WESTFALL SUGGESTED.  ANYWAY, IT'S MY HOPE THAT THE TRANSPORTATION PLAN BEFORE YOU TONIGHT WILL SOME HOW BEGIN TO CHANGE OUR PERSONAL MOBILITY CULTURE AND - -
00:50:43.279: >> 30 MORE SECONDS.
00:50:44.980: >> AND I SUPPORT THAT. BUT THE LAST YEAR HAS MADE ME DEEPLY PESSIMISTIC. I THINK WE'RE GOING TO NEED MORE RADICAL MEASURES THAN THE ONES IN THIS PLAN. FOR A START, TURN MOST OF DOWNTOWN INTO A VEHICLE-FREE PEDESTRIAN ZONE.  I'M NOT NAIVE, BECAUSE THE WHOLE ORGANIZATION OF MODERN SOCIETY, INCLUDING OUR CITY, IS BUILT AROUND THE AUTO, WE PROBABLY CAN ONLY MAKE A REAL DIFFERENCE ON THE FRINGES. I DON'T SEE PEOPLE GIVING UP ON LIMITED PERSONAL MOBILITY. IT'S TOO DEEPLY BEDDED IN OUR CULTURE.
00:51:16.612: >> THREE MINUTES, SPEAKER.
00:51:18.314: >> THAT DOZEN MEAN WE SHOULDN'T TRY.
00:51:19.815: >> THANK YOU.
00:51:20.649: >> A THANK YOU VER MUCH. IF THERE'S ANYONE ELSE THAT WISHES TO ADDRESS THE TRANSPORTATION AND PLANNING COMMISSIONS DURING THIS PUBLIC HERRING, PLEASE PRESS STAR 9 ON YOUR PHONE TO RAISE YOUR HAND.
00:51:38.501: >> CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 604.
00:51:48.677: >> HI, THANKS.  THIS IS ERIC, 1318 ROSEWOOD.  I'D LIKE TO SAY THANKS TO ALL OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE INVOLVED IN CREATING THIS PLAN INCLUDING THE COMMISSIONERS WHO I KNOW HAVE GIVEN A LOT OF THEIR TIME. I'D I'D LIKE TO SAY THIS PLAN IS REALLY A BEAUTIFUL DOCUMENT, NOT ONLY IS IT SUBSTANTIVE, BUT IT'S ACCESSIBLE AS MR. LENART SAID, IT'S VERY IMPRESSIVE. I THINK EVERYBODY SHOULD BE HAPPY WITH IT. I HAD A COUPLE OF COMMENTS, ONE IS THE AS SAFETY ESPECIALLY IS CONSIDERED THE PRIMARY VALUE. I WAS WONDERING WHY LIGHTING WAS NOT EMPHASIZED MORE.  I WOULD HAVE PAT A WHOLE CHAPTER IN, I THINK. I'LL BE VERY, VERY SPECIFIC, THE BICYCLE CORRIDOR OR THE CORRIDOR BETWEEN STATE STREET AND STADIUM ON PACKARD, THAT PACKARD BETWEEN THE DEVILS TRIANGLE AND STADIUM IS WOEFULLY POORLY LIT.  IT'S THERE AND THEN IT SOME HOW GETS DEFERRED AND I WOULD SUBMIT THAT THIS IS A PRIMARY PEDESTRIAN CORRIDOR 24-7 BECAUSE IT'S IN A PREDOMINANTLY STUDENT AREA. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO STOP STUDENTS FROM RIDING THE WRONG WAY WEARING ALL BLACK AND NO REFLECTORS ON THEIR BIKE IN THE BIKE LANE, BUT IF YOU ILLUMINATE THAT CORRIDOR BETTER YOU REDUCE THE CHANCE OF SOMEONE DYING OR SERIOUS ACCIDENT OR IN FACT LOWERING THE CRIME RATE POTENTIALLY ALTHOUGH THERE'S SOME QUESTION AS TO WHETHER THAT IS, THERE'S A CORRELATION THERE. ANYWAY, AND THE OTHER THING I'D LIKE TO COMMENT ON IS THE HEALTHY STREETS.  I TRIED TO CALL IN EARLIER AND DIDN'T GET ON. ENTHUSIASTIC AND ENDORSE THE HEALTHY STREETS I LIVE ON ROSEWOOD, CLOSING ROSEWOOD AT THE INDUSTRIAL AREAS AND THE PARALLEL STREETEWITT AND THE HARPWHICH E BEING USED TODAY ROUGSTREETS D TRACTORS AND EVERYBODY WHO'S CUTTING THROUGH THIS WILL TURN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD INTO A GUARDING AREA, IT WILL REALLY CHANGE AND RAISE THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD WHICH I SAY IS A PRETTY THROUGH AREA. AND THE OTHER CORRIDOR CHANGES -
00:54:20.596: >> 30 MORE SECONDS.
00:54:21.997: >> WILL BE VERY BENEFICIAL. I KNOW THERE WAS PROBLEMS ON PACKARD AT PLATT BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE BAILING OUT INTO THE NEIGHBORHOODS THERE, AND I THINK YOU CORRECTED THESE. MIGHT NEED SOME TWEAKING I THINK YOU DO NEED SOME BARRIERS AND MARKERS WHERE THE LANES BEGIN AT PACKARD AND EISENHOWER SO THE DRIVERS DON'T NOTICE THOSE BIKE LANES SO YOU DO NEED SOME EXTRA DEMARCATION. SOME DISCUSSION OF COUNCIL ABOUT THAT LAST NIGHT. ANYWAY GREAT JOB ON THIS EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT DOCUMENT, GREAT PIECE OF WORK, AND I ENDORSE IT AND THANK YOU FOR DOING IT.
00:54:59.334: >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
00:55:05.607: >> CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 340. CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 340.  YOU CAN UNMUTE YOUR PHONE USING STAR 6, AND ADDRESS THE COMMISSIONS.

STAR 6 TO UNMUTE YOUR PHONE.
00:56:04.600: >> HI. EVEN MY PHONE IS FAMOUS THANK YOU SO MUCH. THIS IS JESS, I LIVE AT 533 - - I WAS A MEMBER THE CITIZENS ADVISORY COMMITTEE A SMALL PART OF HELPING TO PUT ALL OF THIS PLAN TOGETHER. I WANTED TO SAY FIRST OF ALL SO EXCITED TO SEE SO MUCH OF THIS MOVE FORWARD WE'RE ASKING A LOT WITH ZERO EMISSIONS AND ZERO DEATHS AND I THINK THAT'S APPROPRIATE. I'M GLAD TO SEE US BEING AMBITIOUS WITH OUR GOALS AND WITH THE PLAN BEING APPROPRIATELY AMBITIOUS. WE'RE TALKING A LOT ABOUT THE ENGINEERING AND HOW THIS WILL BE IMPLEMENTED. I HOPE WHEN IT COMES TIME TO TALK ABOUT ENFORCEMENT WE CAN TALK ABOUT MOVING ENFORCEMENT AWAY FROM BEING POLICED OR AT LEAST WITH ARMED RESPONDERS, AND INTO CIVILIAN OR UNARMED PROGRAM. I WOULD BE REALLY INTERESTED. THERE ARE OTHER CITIES THAT ARE TALKING ABOUT DOING OR ARE DOING THIS AND I THINK ANN ARBOR COULD BE A LEADER IN THAT AREA AS WELL. THE LAST THING THAT I WANTED TO SAY WAS A HUGE THANK YOU TO STAFF.  THIS HAS BEEN A MONUMENTAL UNDERTAKING AND HAS CROSSED MULTIPLE DEPARTMENTS. YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN REALLY KEEPING YOUR HAND ON THE STEERING WHEEL FOR YEARS ON THIS. I'M GRATEFUL FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP, I'M GRATEFUL FOR YOUR SERVICE, AND ANN ARBOR'S GOING TO BE BETTER WHEN THIS GETS IMPLEMENTED.  THANK YOU.
00:57:28.016: >> THANK YOU. CALLER WITH A PHONE NUMBER ENDING IN 387. YOU CAN UNMUTE YOUR PHONE GO AHEAD.
00:57:46.802: >> MY NAME IS KEN CLARK, I LIVE AT 497 LARKSPUR STREET IN ANN ARBOR. THE OFFICE OF SUSTAINABILITY RECENTLY REVISED ANN ARBOR'S GAS EMISSIONS INVENTORY.  THAT OFFICE NOW RECOGNIZES TRANSPORTATION IS OUR GREATEST SOURCE OF EMISSIONS AND ARE STILL GROSSLY UNDERESTIMATED. NOTHING CHANGED IN THIS PLAN FOR THE CHANGE IN EMOTIONS ESTIMATE. A PLAN FOR 18% OF TRANSPORTATION.  WE PAID 17 IN THE CURRENT ONLINE COPY OF THE PLAN. NOT THE 30 PLUS PERCENT THAT'S OUR REALITY. OUR COMMUNITY GOAL REMAINS TO REDUCE GREEN HOUSE GAS EMISSIONS TO ZERO BY 2030. THIS IS A FINE PLAN FOR REDUCING OUR TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS TO 0 BY 2060 OR LITTER. THIS PLAN WON'T RESULT IN EVEN CLOSE TO ZERO EMISSIONS FROM OUR TRANSPORTATION SECTOR BY 2030. THE MOST DIFFICULT PROBLEM WE FACE IN GETTING TO 820, REGARDING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS THIS IS AN IMPORTANTLY WASTED OPPORTUNITY REGRETTING IN 2030. THIS PLAN WILL BE CHANGEED TO MUCH OUR GAS EMISSIONS REALITY AND NOT JUST CHANGING THE NUMBER ON PAGE 17.  ACTUALLY DOING MEASURES THAT WOULD GET US ZERO EMISSIONS BY 2030. THANKS.
00:59:06.848: >> THANK YOU. IF ANYONE ELSE WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PORT TRANSPORTATION AND PLANNING COMMISSION DURING THIS PUBLIC HEARING, PLEASE PRESS STAR NON ON YOUR PHONE.
00:59:29.905: >> CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 340, PRESS STAR 6. GO AHEAD.
00:59:37.813: >> UH, GREETINGS COMMISSIONERS. MY NAME IS LUIS VAZQUEZ, I'M AT 1442 PONTIAC TRAIL IN THE NORTH SIDE AND JUG WANTED TO - - JUST WANTED TO ECHO SOME PREVIOUS REMARKS PARTICULARLY FROM KEN GARBER AND KIRK WESTFALL. YEAH, WE ARE WAY BEHIND ON GREEN HOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. I SHARE SOME OF MR. GARBER'S PESSIMISM, BUT AM HOPEFUL AFTER HAVING READ THROUGH THE VISION ZERO DOCUMENTS THAT WE STILL HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS, AND I WOULD URGE YOU TO MOVE FORWARD AS SWIFTLY AS POSSIBLE WITH PARTICULAR ELEMENTS THAT WERE DESCRIBED TO SUCH AS MAKING DOWNTOWN ANN ARBOR MUCH MORE OF A PEDESTRIAN AND BICYCLE FRIENDLY AND ORIENTED ZONE TO PUT IN MORE PROTECTED BIKE LANES ALL THROUGHOUT THE CITY. PROTECTED BIKE LANES. RATHER THAN JUST A PAINTED LINE ON THE STREETS. AND THEN I THINK IT'S A GOOD PLAN. A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF TIME AND EFFORT HAS BEEN SPENT AND YEARS OF WORK, SO KUDOS TO ALL OF YOU FOR PUTTING THIS TOGETHER AND PUSHING IT FORWARD. I SUPPORT WHOLE HEARTEDLY WHAT IT IS THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO AND URGE YOU TO JUST CONTINUE. THANK YOU.
01:01:48.477: >> THANK YOU. IF ANYONE ELSE WISHES TO ADDRESS THE JOINT COMMISSION ON FOR THIS PUBLIC HEARING PLEASE PRESS STAR 9 ON YOUR PHONE.
01:01:59.154: >> I THINK ALL THE CALLERS ON THE LINE HAVE SPOKEN AT THIS POINT.
01:02:04.593: >> EXCELLENT. WE WILL CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING. CHAIR KLEINMAN, WOULD YOU LIKE TO READ THE MOTION FOR THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION?
01:02:14.269: >> SURE. LET ME FIND IT. SO THE PROPOSED - - NOPE, SORRY, WRONG PLACE. THE PROPOSED MOTION IS THAT ANN ARBOR TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION RECOMMENDS THAT THE CITY PLANNING COMMISSION AND CITY COUNCIL ADOPT THE ANN ARBOR MOVING TOGETHER TOWARDS VISION ZERO CITY OF ANN ARBOR COMPREHENSIVE TRANSPORTATION PLAN AS AN ELEMENT OF THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR MASTER PLAN AND REPEALS THE PREVIOUS DOCUMENTS THAT THIS UPDATE REPLACES. THE ANN ARBOR TRANSPORTATION PLAN FROM 2009 AND THE NON-MOTORIZED TRANSPORT TRANSPORTATION PLAN FROM 2007, AND THE UPDATE FROM 13. CAN I GET A MOTION FOR THAT ONE I SEE COUNCIL MEMOIR BRIGS AND SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER LEE.  I THINK I HAND IT BACK TO YOU.
01:03:09.758: >> I THINK THAT RIGHT. WE HAVE TWO MOTIONS THAT ARE SIMILAR BUT WE HAVE TWO SO LET ME READ THEM BOTH RESOLVED BY THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION THAT THE ANN ARBOR MOVING TOGETHER TOWARD VISION ZERO CITY OF ANN ARBOR COMPREHENSIVE TRANSPORTATION PLAN INCLUSIVE OF ALL APPENDIXES IS ADOPTED AND RESOLVED THAT THE FOLLOWING DOCUMENTS ARE HERE STANDBY REPEALED: THE ANN ARBOR TRANSPORTATION PLAN, 2009. THE NON-MOTORIZED TRANSPORTATION PLAN OF 2007. AND THE UPTATE FROM 20 THEN. THAT'S THE FIRST. THEN THE SECOND IS THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION HEREPIE RECOMMENDS THE CITY COUNCIL ADOPT THE ANN ARBOR MOVING TOGETHER TOWARDS VISION ZERO CITY OF ANN ARBOR COMPREHENSIVE TRANSPORTATION PLAN AS AN ELEMENT OF THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR MASTER PLAN, AND REPEALS THE PREVIOUS DOCUMENT DOCUMENT THAT THIS UPDATE REPLACES, THE NAB TRANSPORT TRANSPORTATION PLAN FROM 2009 AND THE NON-MOTORIZED FROM 2007 AND THE UPDATE IN 2013 MOVED BY COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN. WE'RE IN DISCUSSION.  IF YOU WANT TO JOIN THE THE QUEUE TO TALK, LIKE, RAISE YOUR REAL HAND. IF SOMEBODY'S TALKING AND YOU WANT TO TACK ON A COMMENT OR HAVE A FOLLOW-UP QUESTION ON THE VERY SAME TOPIC USE THE RAISE HAND BUTTON ON ZOOM SO WE CAN SNEAK YOU IN. AGAIN, IT'S 8:10 P.M. IN, I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN DO THIS IN ABOUT 30 MINUTES OR SO? BUT WE'LL TALK AS LONG AS IT NEEDS TO SINCE THIS IS IMPORTANT POLICYMAKING. JUST KEEP AN EYE ON TIME. COMMISSIONER HESS.
01:05:06.808: >> YES, UH, THANK YOU CHAIR MILLS.  I JUST WANTED TO MAKE A CLARIFYING QUESTION. THERE WERE SOME SUGGESTED MODIFICATIONS PRESENTED BY STACEY MEEKINS AND I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY WHETHER THE MOTIONS ARE INCLUSIVE OF THOSE OR NOT. I WANT TO PUT THAT OUT FOR YOUR DELIBERATION.
01:05:28.897: >> THAT IS A GREAT QUESTION THAT I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO PUT TO STAFF. WHICH IS THE DISCUSSION OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT, THE MOTION PASSING, WHERE IS THE TEXT THAT INCLUDES THOSE ELEMENTS?
01:05:47.916: >> MR.
01:05:48.817: >> SO THAT HAS NOT BEEN INTEGRATED INTO THE DRAFT. THOSE ARE DESCRIPTIONS OF LANGUAGE THAT WE INTEND TO MY PERSPECVE I AM COMRTLE,M AND THRANSPORTATIONNS, COMMISSION IS, MOVING FORWARD WITH THOSE WITH THOSE WITH STAFF TO INCORPORATE THOSE IDEAS I THINK AS MEEKINS DID A GOOD JOB OF SUMMARIZING WHAT THEY ARE AND WHERE THEY WILL GO. ALTERNATIVELY IF YOU THINK THEY ARE MORE SIGNIFICANT NATURE AND YOU WOULD LIKE TO SE THAT INFORMATION IN THE DOCUMENT PRIOR TO YOUR ACTION, LET SO BE YOR DIRECTION. I GUESS I WOULD START FROM THE SUGGESTION THAT THE PLAN IS BEING UPDATED WITH THAT PRESENTATION MATERIAL, THAT PRESENTATION THAT'S AVAILABLE THAT WILL BE AVAILABLE IN REGISTRAR FOR THE RECORD OF THE MEETING SO EVERYBODY HAS NOW SEEN THE BENEFIT OF THOSE LANGUAGE AND I WOULD SUGGEST YOU START FROM THE PERSPECTIVE THAT THOSE CHANGES ARE NOW INCORPORATED AS IDENTIFIED SINCE THE APRIL DRAFT AND AS PROPOSED BY STAFF. A SHORTER WAY, YOU CAN TAKE ACTION AND, I AM PRESUMING THAT YOU ARE AGREEING TO ALL THOSE. IF YOU WOULD RATHER SEE THE DRAFT REVISED AND PLANNING COMMISSION CAN TAKE THAT ACTION TO POSTPONE UNTIL THOSE HAVE BEEN INCORPORATED AND YOU CAN SEE EXACTLY HOW THEY ARE INCORPORATED.  I DON'T THINK THE CHANGES ARE SUBSTANTIVE, THOUGH. I'M NOT COMFORTABLE WITH STAFF PROCEEDING AB SOLVING THOSE.
01:07:35.290: >> ALL RIGHT. COMMISSIONER GIVE RANDALL AND THEN COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT.
01:07:42.897: >> GIVE RANDALL:  I AM CURIOUS ABOUT THE ADDITION OF NEWPORT THAT WENT IN. I'M CURIOUS ABOUT THE TRANSPORTATION GROUP'S BALANCING ACT OF TAKING DOWN IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO MAKE ROADS MORE COM ACCOMMODATING TO BIKES.  I KNOW THAT ROAD HAS BEEN STUDIED A LOT AND IT'S REALLY, REALLY DIFFICULT TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THAT HELPEN WITH BIKE LANES AND NOT TAKING OUT, LIKE, HUGE OLD OAKS. I'M JUST WONDERING DURING YOUR DELIBERATIONS HOW YOU LOOKED AT THAT BALANCING ACT OF EXISTING NATURAL FEATURES THAT THE CITY ALSO HAS GOALEDS AROUND AS WELL AS INCORPORATING THESE TRANSPORTATION FALLS FOR CONNECTIVITY AND THINGS LIKE THAT. I DON'T HAVE ANY EASY ANSWERS. I'M JUST CURIOUS IF THAT WAS PART OF YOUR DELIBERATION IN THE PLANNING OF THESE TWO BECAUSE SOME ARE A LOT EASIER THAN OTHERS IN TERMS OF ADDING CORRIDORS TO THIS. SO THAT CAN BE, YOU KNOW, STAFF OR TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION NUMBER, OR THE FOLKS THAT PUT TOGETHER A PLAN, JUST CURIOUS HOW YOU ALL STRUCK THAT BALANCE.
01:09:05.980: >> MS. MEEKINS AND I ALSO SAW MR. COOPER.
01:09:09.684: >> THANKS.  I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY NEWPORT ROAD WAS ADDED - - THERE'S A DISTINCTION IN THE PLAN ON WHICH ROUTES ARE RECOMMENDED TO BE THE ALL AGES AND ABILITIES NETWORK VERSUS JUST PART OF A BROADER NETWORK, AND NEWPORT ROAD WE INCLUDED AS PART OF THE BROADER NETWORK RECOGNIZING IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO GET A VERY COMFORTABLE FACILITY WITH DEDICATED SPACE FOR BICYCLISTS. SO NEWPORT ROAD, FOR INSTANCE, MIGHT BE A ROUTE BY ADDING SOME SHARED LANE MARKINGS AND SO IT'S NOT GOING TO BE COMFORTABLE FOR EVERYBODY, BUT IT WOULD BE NOTED FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE COMFORTABLE RIDING ON THAT TYPE OF FACILITY.
01:09:55.029: >> SO IN OTHER WORDS, KEEPING THE LANES, KEEPING BASICALLY THE WIDTH OF THE ROAD THE SAME, BUT JUST ADDING PAINT THAT ALERTS DRIVERS TO THE FACT THAT BIKERS ARE GOING TO BE USING IT.
01:10:09.177: >> RIGHT.
01:10:09.477: >> OKAY.
01:10:09.744: >> AND WE'RE NOT DESIGNATED DESIGNS BUT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I COULD ENVISION ON NEWPORT.
01:10:16.884: >> OKAY.  ALL RIGHT, THANKS.
01:10:18.886: >> GO AHEAD, MR. COOPER.
01:10:20.655: >> IN ADDITION TO THAT, I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT AS I DESCRIBED IN MY INTRODUCTORY COMMENTS WHERE WE WERE 15 YEARS AGO IS LIGHT YEARS AWAY BEHIND WHERE WE ARE TODAY AND NEWPORT, IT WAS ABOUT TWO OR THREE YEARS AGO WE STRIKED THE BIKE LANE ON ONE SIDE AND THERE'S PARKING ON THE OTHER SIDE. BY INCLUDING IT AS A KEY BICYCLING CORRIDOR, PERHAPS AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH PLANNED IMPLEMENTATION WE COULD PICK UP ISSUES OF PERHAPS REMOVING MORE PARKING ON STREET IN ORDER TO GET BIKE LANES ON BOTH SIDES AS THE PLAN MIGHT BE SEEKING WITH THIS RECOMMENDATION. I ALSO WANT TO USE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO POINT OUT THAT A LOT OF WHAT THE PLAN IS IS A PLAN OF RECOMMENDED IDEAS IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE A TRANSPORTATION RESULT, AND THAT WE AS STAFF ESTABLISH PROJECTS. IN THOSE PROJECTS EACH PROJECT HAS ITS OWN PUBLIC PARTICIPATION PROCESS AND THOSE MOST IMPACTED OR MOST BENEFITED BY THE IMPROVEMENT ARE GIVEN FAIR OPPORTUNITY TO HELP SHAPE THE FINAL DESIGN. WE RECEIVED NUMEROUS COMMENTS IN THE MAN DEVELOPMENT PROCESS THAT FOLKS WANTED A MORE PRESCRIPTIVE PLAN. THIS IS MORE OF A STRATEGIC PLAN, WHERE WE'RE OUTLINING IN BROAD SENSES THE DIRECTION WE WANT TO GO, AND THEN THE OPPORTUNITIES WILL BE PURSUED AS PROJECTS EMERGE OVER TIME. I HOPE THAT THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE DIRECTION THAT THE COMMISSIONS ARE COMFORTABLE WITH. IT'S CLEARLY A DIRECTION THAT WE HEARD FROM THE COMMUNITY. THANK YOU.
01:12:02.824: >> COMMISSIONER GIBB RANDALL, ANYTHING ELSE?
01:12:32.920: >> I LOVE THE DIGGS OF THE GLOSSARY.  I - - I LOVE THE ADDITION OF THE GLOSSARY. I HAVE A COUPLE OF OTHER TERMS I WOULD LOVE TO SEE INCLUDED IF YOU ARE AMENABLE TO THAT. THE WORDS EQUITY AND EQUITABLE ARE ALL OVER THIS DOCUMENT AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO DEFINE WHAT EXACTLY WE MEAN BY THAT, AND THEN IN STRATEGY NUMBER 20, I THINK YOU MIGHT REMEMBER US TALKING ABOUT THIS STRATEGY THE LAST ONE, UNDERREPRESENTED VOICES.  I AM NOT AN EXPERT ON THIS, BAT I AM NOT SURE THAT UNDERREPRESENTED IS THE RIGHT TERM TO USE.  I THINK WE MIGHT WANT TO LOOK INTO IT MIGHT BE UNDERSERVED OR UNDER RESOURCED. I'M NOT THE EXPERT, I THINK WE JUST MIGHT WANT TO LOOK A LITTLE BIT MORE INTO THE CORRECT TERMS WE WANT TO BE USING REGARDLESS. THAT TERM ALSO I THINK NEEDS TO BE IN THE GLOSSARY. ALONG THAT POINT, I KNOW THE COMMENT I MADE ABOUT STRATEGY NUMBER 20 LAST TIME I KNOW THAT THESE AREN'T PRIORITIZED BUT I'D LIKE TO SEE IT HIGHER UP IN THAT ORDER. I THINK IF WE'RE SERIOUS ABOUT EQUITY IN THIS CITY WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO SHOW THAT WE'RE SERIOUS ABOUT IT AND I THINK ELEVATING IT, UNDERSTANDING THAT THESE ARE NOT A PRIORITY ORDER, IT WOULD JUST SORT OF SHOW THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS VERY SERIOUS, NEAR THE TOP EVEN THOUGH I UNDERSTAND - - I THINK THOSE TWO ADDITIONS WOULD BE REALLY GREAT. A QUESTION ON THE LANE REDUCTION COMMENT THAT MR. WESTFALL BROUGHT UP... DOES THE PLAN THE WAY THAT THOSE ACTION STEPS ARE IDENTIFIED MAKE IT HARDER TO FOR STAFF, FOR ANY COMMISSIONERS, TO WORK ON A LANE REDUCTION PROJECT THAT IS NOT IN AN ALREADY IDENTIFIED CORRIDOR OR IS NOT PART OF THE RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT? I'M NOT SURE I GUESS I'M ASKING STAFF THIS QUESTION.
01:14:31.906: >> SO, WE HAVE RELIED UPON STANDARD ENGINEERING PRACTICE AND CHARACTERISTICS OF BOTH THE AREA THAT THE ROAD EXISTS WITHIN, AS WELL AS THE TRAFFIC ON THE ROAD IN ORDER TO EVALUATE APPROPRIATE LANE RECONFIGURATION RECOMMENDATIONS SO IT'S NOT GOING TO MAKE IT ANY HARDER. CLEARLY ALL, THE ISSUE IN THE CITY HAS BEEN WITH NEARLY 20 YEARS OF IMPLEMENTING LANE REDUCTION STRATEGIES. WE'VE COVERED MOST OF THEM THAT ARE ACTUALLY FEASIBLE. NOW, THERE MAY BE A SHORT SEGMENT HERE OR THERE THAT WE SOME OF WHICH ARE STILL IN THE PLAN TO BE DONE AND THERE MAY BE OTHERS THAT AS A RESULT OF TRAFFIC VOLUME CHANGES WITH CHANGING BEHAVIOR THAT MAY IN THE FUTURE EMERGE, BUT THE LANGUAGE ITSELF DOES NOT MAKE IT ANYMORE DIFFICULT, BUT IT DOESN'T, I THINK WHAT THE COMMENTER WANTED WAS LANGUAGE THAT MIGHT FACILITATE IT AND THE ISSUE COULD COME UP THROUGH A CIP DEVELOPMENT, IT COULD COME -P THROUGH THE ANNUAL PROJECT IDENTIFICATION THAT WE AS STAFF ARE NOT PURSUING.  IN ESSENCE, THE LANGUAGE IS NEUTRAL, WE'VE BEEN AT THIS, I THINK WE'RE PROBABLY ONE OF THE LEADERS IN THE STATE, IF NOT THE NATION, CAN ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTING LANE REDUCTIONS AS ONE OF THE OTHER COMMENTERS A SAW COLE TALKED ABOUT WE EVEN PERSUADED MDOT TO DO A TRUNK LINE. WHICH IS PROBABLY THE ONLY ONE IN THE STATE. SO WE'RE KEEN ON THIS, WE SEE ALL THE BENEFITS BOTH FOR SAFETY AS WELL AS MULTIMODALTY. AND IF THERE ARE MORE TO DO WE'D LOVE TO DO THEM.
01:16:23.084: >> WE'VE ALSO GOT A PUBLIC COMMENT.
01:16:30.257: >> IT'S ACTUALLY GROW DON'T MIND, THIS MIGHT NOT BOO Y THE RIGHT TIME.  I WOULD LIKE PERSONALLY LIKE TO SEE SOME OF THE LANGUAGE IN THIS DOCUMENT CHANGE BEFORE IT COMES TO COUNCIL. I THINK ON PAGE 37 IF IT'S JUST THE NEXT ACTION STEPS AS IT SAID EVALUATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR LANE REDUCTION, INSTEAD OF CORRIDOR RECONSTRUCTION PROJECTS THAT WOULD BROADEN IT A LITTLE BIT AND THEN IT WOULD, I THINK THERE IS SOMETHING ALSO ON PAGE 129 AROUND THAT I THINK WE MAY, I'M HOPING I GUESS THAT WE FIND THAT WE MIGHT BE MORE AMBITIOUS ABOUT WHAT THE NUMBERS... AROUND AROUND THE TRAFFIC AND HOW AMBITIOUS WE WANT TO BE ON CERTAIN ROADS ABOUT LANE RECONFIGURATIONS. SO THAT WOULD MAKE ME FEEL A LOT MORE COMFORTABLE.
01:17:41.796: >> GO AHEAD, MR. COOPER.
01:17:42.830: >> THOSE ARE TYPES OF CHANGES I THINK BASED ON AN ACTION OF THE BODIES THIS EVENING THAT STAFF CAN AGREE TO. WE'RE NOT SUGGESTING IT ONLY OCCUR WITH ROAD RECONSIDERATIONS SO IF THERE'S AN ISSUE OF CAN WE BROADEN THAT LANGUAGE SIMILAR TO THE OTHER AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN OUTLINED AS DIRECTION FORS TO MA ADJUSTMENTS, W WOULD CEPT THAT A BE MORE THAN HAY TO BRINGHAT BK TO E BODY.
01:18:14.295: >> I SEE COMMISSIONER HULL'S HAND. IS IT DIRECTLY ON THIS OR THE NEXT THING AFTER THIS?  YOU'RE MUTE, THOUGH.  GO AHEAD AND UNMUTE. COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT I'M COMING BACK TO YOU.
01:18:27.775: >> IT'S GENERAL COMMENT NOT A RESPONSE TO THIS COMMENT.
01:18:30.277: >> LET'S LET COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT FINISH OFF HER LIST AND THEN WE'LL COME RIGHT TO YOU, COMMISSIONER HALL.
01:18:39.787: >> THANK YOU.
01:18:40.488: >> WE HAVE A PUBLIC COMMENT SUBMITTED ABOUT MOTORCYCLES AND HOW HE DIDN'T FEEL THAT THEY WERE PROPERLY REPRESENTED IN THIS PLAN, AND I JUST WANTED TO HEAR FROM EITHER MS. MEEKINS OR MR. COOPER HOW MOTOR CYCLE SAID WERE CONSIDERED AND IF YOU IS A THAT COMMENT AND HOW YOU MIGHT RESPOND.
01:18:58.806: >> GO AHEAD, MR. COOPER.
01:19:00.574: >> MR. COOPER:  THE FIRST THING I HAVE HAVE TO ADMIT THAT SINCE 1978 I HAVE A A MOTORCYCLIST. MANY FOLKS IN THIS MEETING ARE AWARE OF THAT.  WE DID NOT, AND WE DO NOT DIFFERENTIATE MOTORCYCLES IF YOU WILL FOR SPECIAL TREATMENT. BUT THAT AS WE CONDUCTED ALL OF THE ANALOGIES MOTORCYCLES COUNTED AS A VEHICLE, WHETHER IT'S AN A ADT OR VOLUME COUNT MOTORCYCLES THAT ARE INVOLVED IN CRASHES ARE GENERALLY RECORDED AS VEHICLE CRASHES SO ALTHOUGH I AS A MOTOR CYCLIST, I'M INTIMATELY AWARE OF THE SAFETY CONCERNS OF MOTORCYCLING, AS WE LOOK THROUGH THE STATISTICS THAT WE'VE LOOKED AT IN VISION ZERO, NOTHING POPPED OUT AT US THAT SAID THAT THERE'S A PARTICULAR LOCATION IN ANN ARBOR WHERE SPECIAL TREATMENT IS NEEDED FOR THE MOTORCYCLING COMMUNITY. SO WITH THAT I THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WE DON'T DIFFERENTIATE FOR TRUCKS OR BUSES OR OTHER TYPES OF VEHICLES BESIDES MOTORCYCLES AND I DON'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THAT'S ALWAYS CORRECT, BUT AT LEAST AS WE'VE FASHIONED A LONG-RANGE CITY INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN THE PARTICULAR USERS UNLESS THEY STAND OUT AS BEING AS A MATTER OF OR GENERAL ANALYSIS. THEREFORE.
01:20:39.306: >> I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THEM. MY LAST THING IS JUST A REQUEST FOR AT SOME POINT I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR IF WE EVENTUALLY MOVE INTO A MASTER PLANNING PROCESS LESSONS LEARNED FROM THIS PROCESS THAT YOU GUYS JUST WENT THROUGH, PARTICULARLY AS IT RELATES TO COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT, AND CONDUCTING IT VIRTUALLY, I THINK IT WOULD REALLY ENLIGHTEN US AS WE KIND OF MOVE HEAD SINCE I THINK YOU GUYS DID LOT OF THIS DURING COVID. I DON'T THINK VIRTUAL ENGAGEMENT OPPORTUNITIES WILL GO AWAY.  SO I THINK IT WOULD BE REALLY GREAT TO HEAR A DEBRIEF AT SOME POINT. AND THAT IS IT FOR NOW, THANKS.
01:21:15.276: >> COMMISSIONER HULL.
01:21:17.378: >> YEAH, SO I'VE GOT A COUPLE OF THINGS I'M WONDERING ABOUT. THE FIRST ONE KIND OF LIKE THE SECOND ONE THAT COMES AFTER THIS, BUT I'M KIND OF WONDERING HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY IS THERE TO ACTUALLY MAKE CHANGES TO THIS PLAN BECAUSE I KNOW THIS HAS TO GO THROUGH A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT STEPS TO REVIEW. IT SEEMS LIKE CERTAIN CHANGES WOULD IN FACT REQUIRE IT TO GO BACK TO OTHER BODIES.  I KNOW THEY'RE TALKING, LIKE, SOME OF THESE CHANGES CAN BE MADE SO I'M KIND OF WONDERING ABOUT THAT. IT'S PROBABLY NUT HELPFUL TO TALK ABOUT CHANGES THAT CAN'T EVEN BE MADE UNLESS WE HAVE TO DO TONS OF THINGS AND ALSO TO KEEP THAT IN MIND IF THERE'S SOME REQUIREMENT TO GO BACK TO CERTAIN BODIES.
01:22:03.557: >> SOMEONE ON STAFF?
01:22:05.592: >> I'LL JUST SUGGEST IT FROM A MASTER PLANNING PERSPECTIVE, YOU KNOW? THIS IS A BIT OF AN IMPRESSION POINT FOR THE PLANNING COMMISSION AND THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION TO CARRY FORTH THIS PLAN WHICH HAS COME OUT OF A LOT OF COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT IN ITS CURRENT STATE OR WITH MODIFICATION. BUT AT THIS POINT, FROM A TECHNICAL PERSPECTIVE, THE NEXT PHASE OF THIS WOULD BE ADOPTION BY THE PLANNING COMMISSION AND THEN ULTIMATELY CITY COUNCIL, RECOMMENDATION BY THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION OBVIOUSLY AS WELL. BUT LEGISLATIVELY IT IS REQUIRES ACTION BY THE PLANNING COMMISSION AND THE CITY COUNCIL. BOTH THE PLANNING COMMISSION, THE PLANNING COMMISSION HAS THE ABILITY TO MODIFY THE PLAN AT THIS JUNCTURE, BUT TO THE POINT OF THOSE CHANGES THE COMFORT LEVEL AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THEY WANT YOU AS THE COMMISSIONS WANT TO EMPOWER STAFF TO MAKE THE CHANGES BASED ON YOUR DIRECTION OR TO SAY WE WANT TO SEE ANOTHER VERSION OF THIS BEFORE WE'RE WILLING TO TAKE ACTION, THAT'S REALLY UP TO YOUR COMFORT LEVEL BUT IT DOESN'T, IT DOESN'T NECESSITATE THAT IT NECESSARILY HAS TO GO BACK TO ANY OF THE OTHER, THE PREVIOUS ENGAGEMENT PROCESSES. THIS POINT IS, UM, THE PLANNING COMMISSION HAS THAT AUTHORITY AND THE CITY COUNCIL OBVIOUSLY HAS THAT AUTHORITY AS WELL TO ULTIMATELY APPROVE OR REJECT.
01:23:32.413: >> OKAY. SO I GUESS I WILL POINT OUT MY ONE ISSUE WITH THIS PLAN THAT I MENTIONED IN ONE OF THE PREVIOUS HEARINGS BUT DID NOT GET ADDRESSED IN THE FINAL DRAFT, AND THAT IS THAT THE BUS, THE SECTION ABOUT TRANSIT SERVICE, THE HAVING GOALS FOR IMPROVING TRANSIT SERVICE SETS NO GOALS FOR IMPROVING SUNDAY OR HOLIDAY SERVICE. AND I KIND OF FEEL LIKE THAT SHOULDN'T BE IGNORED BECAUSE RIGHT NOW OUR SUNDAY TRANSIT SERVICE IS PRETTY BARE AND IF WE'RE NOT GOING TO SET A GOAL FOR IMPROVING THAT IT'S GOING TO REMAIN BARE, RUNNING UNTIL LIKE 7:00 P.M. WHICH ISN'T EVEN SUNSET DURING THE SUMMER AND THAT LONG BEEN ONE OF MY COMPLAINTS ABOUT TRANSIT AND IT SEEMS LIKE WE SHOULD SET A GOAL TO IMPROVE THAT.
01:24:29.837: >> DISCUSSION, COMMISSIONER BRIGS AND THEN MS. MEEKINS.
01:24:33.240: >> I JUST WANT TO SAY I AGREE.
01:24:43.050: >> MS. MEEKINS:  ; I'LL POINT TO ELI ON WHETHER OR NAT WE WANT TO ADD A SPECIFIC TARGET AS SOME OF THAT IS TRIPLE ATA'S PURVIEW. WE DID ADD TO SOME LANGUAGE TO THAT SATURDAY, THOUGH TO ADDRESS SUNDAY SERVICE. ON PAGE 90 OF THE CURRENT PLAN.
01:25:02.703: >> YEAH, I THINK I SAW A MENTION OF SUNDAY SERVICE BUT JUST THE FACT THAT WASN'T, THAT WE HAD WEEK DAY AND SATURDAY GOALS BUT NOT SUNDAY TOLD ME THAT IT JUST GAVE ME THE IMPRESSION THAT YEAH, THAT'S GOING TO REMAIN 60 MINUTE SERVICE UNTIL 7:00 P.M. IN GENERAL.
01:25:35.202: >> AS STACEY HAS POINTED OUT WE'RE NOT KICKING THIS BACK AND FORTH. THE LANGUAGE THAT WE'VE ADDED TO THE PLAN THAT SHE'S POINTED OUT ON PAGE 90 OUTLINES OUR ATTEMPTING TO ADDRESS YOUR INTEREST AS EXPRESSED RECOGNIZING THAT THE CITY DOES NOT PROVIDE THE TRANSIT SERVICE BUT WE COLLABORATE AND COORDINATE WITH THE TRIPLE ATA. WE MAKE REFERENCE TO HAVING RELIABLE TRANSIT AS A RELIABLE OPTION TO THE LATER HOURS AND THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE THE TRIPLE ATA TO PROVIDE THAT. BUT IF WE PUT A POLICY IN OUR PLAN RECOGNIZING THAT WE THE CITY DO NOT DELIVER TRANSIT SERVICE, THAT'S MORE DETAIL THAN THAT, IT MAY ACCOMMODATE YOUR ISSUE AND LANGUAGE, BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT IT'S GOING TO AFFECT WHAT IS DELIVERED IN THE STREET. SO WE'RE OPEN TO STRENGTHENING THE LANGUAGE IF THAT'S WHAT THE DESIRE OF THE BODY IS, UNDERSTANDING THE LIMITATIONS OF WHAT WE, THE CITY, CAN TO.
01:26:42.502: >> ARE YOU SAYING THAT TRIPLE ATA IS RESISTENCEEN TO ADDING SUNDAY SERVICE OR SOMETHING?
01:26:49.176: >> I'M NOT GOING TO DESCRIBE THAT THEY'RE RESISTENT TO IT. THEY'RE UNDERTAKING THEIR OWN PLANNING PROCESS AND THEY MAKE RESOURCE ALLOCATION DECISIONS BASED ON THEIR PLANNING, THEIR PLANNING PROCESSES AND THEIR BUDGET. SO I BELIEVE THAT THERE'S A TRIPLE ATA REPRESENTATIVE ON THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION WHO MIGHT BE BETTER POSITIONED TO DISCUSS THEIR DECISION-MAKING PROCESS.
01:27:16.236: >> LOOKS LIKE COMMISSIONER SMITH YOU RAISED YOUR HAND WITH THAT TO ADD IN HERE.
01:27:22.576: >> JUST TO SIMPLY SAY WE ARE ENGAGING IN OUR OWN LONG RANGE PROCESS RIGHT NOW, SET TO BE DONE AROUND MARCH AND WOULD WELCOME INPUT ALONG THOSE REGARDS.
01:27:39.092: >> ANY OTHER COMMENTS ON THIS ISSUE OR ANYTHING ELSE?  YOU CAN GIVE ME A WAVE. COMMISSIONER BRIGS AND THEN COMMISSIONER KLEINMAN.
01:27:55.776: >> THANK YOU FOR ALL OF THE INCORPORATION OF MY PREVIOUS COMMENTS IN THE PROCESS A FOO THINGS, I WANTED TO GET CLARIFICATION. IT LOOKS LIKE ONE OF THE RECOMMENDED EDITIONS IS THERE WAS ALLUDED TO I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT THE VERBIAGE IS NOW AROUND MDOT. COULD YOU EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT BIT MORE OF WHAT THE INTENT IS AND HOW THAT MIGHT RELATE TO JACKSON AND HURON? THAT MIGHT TAILER MY COMMENTS A LITTLE BIT MORE.
01:28:28.375: >> GO AHEAD, MR. COOPER.
01:28:31.111: >> SO THE FIRST ISSUE AND COUNCIL MEMBER BRIGS THANK YOU FOR RAISING THE QUESTION BECAUSE IT ALLOWS ME TO SAY THAT HURON CORRIDOR IS IDENTIFIED AS A PRIORITY CORRIDOR IN THE PLAN. SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE MAPS YOU'LL SEE THAT IT DOES RECEIVE ATTENTION BASED ON THE CRASH PATTERN THAT'S OUT THERE TOWARDS THE DOWNTOWN. WITH REGARD TO THE REVISING THE LANGUAGE TO FURTHER COLLABORATE OR COORDINATE WITH MDOT, THE WAS DIRECTLY IN RESPONSE TO INPUT WE'D RECEIVED FROM ONE OF THE COMMENTERS TONIGHT THAT RAISED THE ISSUE OF A LANE RECONFIGURATION SPECIFICALLY TO ADDRESS, THE PLAN TO ADDRESS WHAT WE DO WITH THE STATE AGAIN UNFORTUNATELY WE AS STAFF RECOGNIZE WE HAVE CERTAIN LIMITS IN TERMS OF OUR AUTHORITY RELATIVE TO THE STATE AND ITS TRUNK LINES SO THE THING THAT WE CAN COMMIT TO DO AND THAT WE'VE ADDED OR WILL ADD INTO THE PLAN IS THAT WE WILL COORDINATE WITH THEM ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND SHARE WITH THEM OURER OUR EXPERIENCE RELATIVE TO CRASHES THAT ARE OCCURRING ON STATE FACILITIES THAT MIGHT BENEFIT FROM LANE RECONFIGURATIONS.  SO THE ADDITIONAL THINKING WHICH IS MUCH MORE COMPLICATED THAN WE CAN GET INTO IS WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S A TURN BACK PROGRAM WHERE THE STATEWIDE TURN THOSE ROADS BACK OVER TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT. THERE HAS BEEN CONSIDERATION TO THATIT RARDOOME IT'SUST AN ISSUE THAT BJECTO A LOT MOR NEGOTIATIONS ABOUT WHAT WE WOULD BE TAKING OVER AND HOW WE WOULD BE ABLE TO MANAGE AND ADMINISTER THAT GOING FORWARD THAT IS WELL BEYOND WHERE WE ARE IN THE EVOLUTION OF THIS PLAN. IF THAT BECOMES AN ISSUE THAT AFTER A YEAR OR TWO OF COORD NATION WITH MDOT, THE COMMUNITY WANTS TO PURSUE THAT, I WOULD SAY AT THAT TIME WE COULD EXTEND THE NEW POLICY AS TO THAT BECOMING A PRIORITY. I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WOULD NEED TO BE REALLY FULLY FLESHED OUT FROM A FINANCIAL STANDPOINT WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT TAKING OVER HIGH VOLUME, HIGH CAPACITY ROADS.
01:30:51.685: >> OKAY. THAT HELPS. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS ENOUGH LANGUAGE AND IT'S DIFFICULT. IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S THAT SORT OF AND MAINE IS LISTED THE TIER TWO CORRIDOR RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF PRIORITY, IS THAT RIGHT? MAYBE? AND I GUESS MY CONCERN JUST TO KIND OF MAKE SURE THE NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATION ISSUES ARE BEING MET IS THAT WE HAVE LONG RECOGNIZED THESE CORRIDORS AS PROBLEMATIC AND WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF CONTROL OVER THEM.  I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS REALLY CLEAR LANGUAGE IN THE PLAN THAT ENABLES US WHEN WE GO TO MDOT, AND MDOT SAYS OUR COMMUNITY ADOPTED THIS EVEN THOUGH I RECOGNIZE THAT OUR THE ARE LIMITATIONS THERE AND IT JUST DOESN'T FEEL VERY CLEAR TO ME. RECOGNIZING THE LIMITATIONS.
01:32:13.967: >> GO AHEAD, MR. COOPER.
01:32:15.035: >> SO, I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION BECAUSE THIS IS A NEW DOCUMENT FOR US AS STAFF AS WELL. AND THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT AREAS, TWO DIFFERENT MAPS THAT THE HURON JACKSON CORRIDOR ACTUALLY SHOWS UP. SO ON WHAT IS PAGE 6 OF THE PLAN THERE IS A CAPITAL PRIORITY TIER ONE TIER TWO AND TIER THREE, AND WHAT YOU'LL SEE THERE IS HURON IS A TIER ONE CAPITAL PRIORITY. SO IT RECEIVES HIGH PRIORITY FOR CONSIDERATION OF INVESTMENT, THE TIER TWO IS A MAP LATER IN THE PLAN THAT ADDRESSES THE SAFETY FOCUS AREAS. SO THERE ARE OTHER ISSUES BEYOND SAFETY OUT THERE, WHICH IS WHY THE TIER ONE CATEGORY IS FOR CAPITAL PROJECTS EVEN THOUGH THE SAFETY ISSUE ONLY BROUGHT IT INTO THE SECOND GROUPING, WHICH WHEN I SAY ONLY THE SECOND GROUPING, IS STILL AN AREA THAT NEEDS ATTENTION.
01:33:15.795: >> SO, FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF HOW YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO INTERACT WITH MDOT IN THE FUTURE, DO YOU FEEL LIKE THERE IS... I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS NEVER A QUESTION THAT THIS IS A PRIORITY, THAT THERE IS A LOT OF WORK THE COMMUNITY WANTS TO SEE DONE HERE IN TERMS OF TRAFFIC COMBING AND NEW FACILITIES. THAT'S EASY TO POINT TO AND TO JUSTIFY THAT CITY COUNCIL HAS SET HOPEFULLY WHEN THEY ADOPT THE PLAN AND SAY OKAY YOU'VE GOT THE JUSTIFICATION THERE.
01:33:46.793: >> YEAH, THAT'S I WOULD ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH THAT STATEMENT. TIER ONE CAPITAL PRIORITY INVESTMENT IS IT.
01:33:54.167: >> OKAY, PERFECT. THANK YOU I THINK THAT WILL MAKE THE RESIDENTS HAPPY EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT SPELLED OUT QUITE AS EXPLICITLY AND THEN THERE'S A SMALL LITTLE ISSUE, AND THEN I'LL END WITH A BIGGER ONE. SO THERE IS IN THE PLAN A IN THE SHORT-TERM RECOMMENDATIONS, EXPAND A2 BE SAFE PROGRAM. IT JUST... I WANT TO MAKE SURE SOMETIMES WE GET REAL EXCITED ABOUT - - I'M GLAD WE'RE DOING EDUCATION, IT'S UM PORT TONIGHT DO COMMUNITY EDUCATION AROUND SAFETY AND AROUND DIFFERENT ISSUES, BUT IT'S EASY ALSO TO PUT A FAIR AMOUNT OF MONEY INTO EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS THAT THEY - - CROSS LOCKS - - CLOTHING THAT DON'T NECESSARILY MOVE THE NEEDLE VERY MUCH EN OUR COMMUNITY. I JUST WANT TO INNOVATIVE WITH EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMMING THAT INS OUT OF GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES.  I THINK IT WOULD BE NICE TO SAY EVALUATE AND EXPAND THE PROGRAM JUST TO MAKE SURE WE'RE CHECKING IN OFF THAT PROGRAM THAT IT'S PRODUCING IS EFFECTIVE AND THAT LEADS A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE I KNOW IN THE BUDGET RECOMMENDATION FOR THIS YEAR THERE'S 133,000-DOLLARS FOR PEDESTRIAN EDUCATION AND THAT MIGHT BE ONE OF MY CONCERNS. THAT WAS ONE PIECE. AND THEN THE OTHER ONE IS BROADER A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS RAISED PIE THE COMMUNITY WHICH IS JUST DOES THIS HELP US, WILL THIS PLAN, IS IT ALIGNED ENOUGH WITH OUR CARBON NEUTRALITY GOALS AND OUR A20 PLAN THAT IF WE IMPLEMENT, IF WE FIND THE RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT THIS PLAN THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO HIT OUR A20 PLAN, OUR CARBON NEUTRALITY GOALS.  HAVE THESE STRATEGIES BEEN LINED UP IN THAT REGARD? IS IT I GUESS THAT'S MY QUESTION.
01:36:18.745: >> I GUESS I'LL RAISE MY HAND. I THINK THE DIFFICULT QUESTION TO ANSWER IS THAT LARGER SECOND QUESTION WHICH IS HOW HOW ALIGNED ARE OUR DECISIONS ABOUT TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE WITH OUR A20 SO AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL WHAT I CAN SAY TO YOU IS IF WE DO NOT IMPLEMENT THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THIS PLAN THERE IS NO CHANCE WHATSOEVER. WHEN I LOOK AT THE ENTIRE SUITE OF RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE PLAN INCLUDING A COMMUNITY-WIDE ALL AGES AND ALL USERS BICYCLING SYSTEM, A ROBUST TRANSIT OPERATION WITH THE SIGNIFICANT INTERCEPT PARK AND RIDE WITH THE VALUE PRICING AND THE PARKING MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES, I THINK THERE IS MORE THAN ENOUGH POLICY GUIDANCE TO AFFECT THE WAY THAT TRANSPORTATION IS RECEIVED IN THE COMMUNITY BUT A THE END OF THE DAY IT BECOMES A HUMAN BEHAVIOR ISSUE. WE CAN CREATE ALL THESE SYSTEMS AND WE CAN PRICE THEM ACCORDINGLY TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO USE THEM AND I THINK THAT BECOMES PART OF THE ISSUE WITH HOW CLOSELY CAN YOU ALIGN THESE STRATEGIES WITH THE VISION ZERO PLAN AND THE A20 PLAN. I THINK THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY COMPLIMENTARY BUT I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT THERE'S NOT MUCH MORE WE CAN ADD IN TERMS OF POLICIES ON A TRANSPORTATION PLAN. WE'RE GONNA HAVE A TOUGH ROAD AHEAD TO IMPLEMENT ALL THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE IN THUS PLAN AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT CHALLENGE. AS WE HAVE SEEN THE NEEDLE MOVED ON TRIPLE ATA RIDERSHIP BASED ON THE MILLAGE VOTES THEY'VE RECEIVED OVER THE PAST DECADE THAT WE'VE SEEN OUR LEVEL OF BICYCLING INCREASE BY 150, 200 PERCENT OVER THE LAST 15 YEARS, THAT THERE IS CLEARLY OPPORTUNITIES TO BUILD IT AND THEY WILL COME, AND TO ATTRACT DIFFERENT BEHAVIORS. I'M NOT QUITE AS AT A PLACE WHERE I WOULD SAY TO YOU COMFORTABLEABLY THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET THERE. I KNOW WE'RE ON A TRAJECTORY TO BE A LEADER BOTH IN THE STATE, IN THE COUNTRY WHICH MIGHT MEAN THE WORLD, BUT THERE. ALL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T QUITE HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY WE HAVE IN NORTH AMERICA I THINK THAT'S A QUESTION AND YOU NEED TO HOLD OUR FEET AS STAFF TO THE FIRE AS WE GO FORWARD IN TIME TO SEE IF THOSE SHIFTS THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR ARE OCCURRING. ARE WE DELIVERING THE SYSTEMS TO ACCOMMODATE THE ALTERNATIVE FORMS OF MOBILITY THAT ARE CARBON ZERO.
01:39:04.210: >> THANK YOU, AND I APPRECIATE THAT, THOSE COMMENTS. YES, I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE TIMELINES WE HAVE IN THE BACKES PALINGS Y AROUND THE REAL DEVELOP - - IN THE BACK, ESPECIALLY AROUND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE FACILITIES ADDING FOUR MILES A YEAR OF LOW STRESS BIKEWAYS AND NOW IT'S AT FIVE BUT WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE TO IN THE NEXT FEBRUARY YORES DRAMATICALLY SHIFT WHAT OUR INFRASTRUCTURE LOOKS LIKE, OBVIOUSLY STRUGGLING TO FIND THE FUNDING FOR THAT. BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THE TIMELINES ARE ALIGNED ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOME OF THAT PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE, PARTICULARLY ON THE BICYCLE LANE, WHICH I THINK WE'VE LAGGED BEHIND ON. WE'RE DOING GREAT THINGS ON IT, BUT I THINK WE FOCUSED A LOT ON PEDESTRIAN ISSUES OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS U RIGHTFULLY SO. I THINK IF WE'RE PLAYING A LITTLE CATCH UP ON SOME OF THE PROTECTED BIKE LANES AND THINGS LIKE THAT MAYBE SOME COMMUNITIES HAVE MOVED HERE SOONER THAN US TO A DEGREE WE ARE MAKING SURE THERE'S PARTICULARLY IN THE BICYCLES FACILITIES AREA THOSE TIMELINES ARE ALIGNED TO HELP US MAKE SURE THAT WE REACH OUR GOALS. WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT THE RESOURCES PIECE FOR THIS, BUT THAT IS MY LAST COMMENT.
01:40:20.853: >> I WOULD JUST SAY, TOO, UM, ADD TO IN THAT THIS IS ONE OF MANY ELEMENTS OF OUR KIND OF MASTER PLAN THAT IS CONSTANTLY EVOLVING, TOO. SO I JUST PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE.
01:40:39.372: >> MR. LENART, GO AHEAD.
01:40:41.040: >> MR. LENART:  JUST TO FURTHER TACK ONTH IT'S THE LAND USE DECISIONS WE MAKE, THE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT TRANSIT ORIENTED ZONING, THEY'RE INTERRELATED. THE MORE SUCCESSFUL WE ARE IN REGULATORY FRAMEWORK THAT SPURS AND ENCOURAGES THE TYPE OF DEVELOPMENT THAT CREATES THE DEMAND FOR THOSE SOURCES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR THOSE OTHER MODES, I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENT BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST THE TRANSPORTATION ASPECT OF OUR MASTER PLAN PORTFOLIO, BUT ALSO THE LAND USE DECISION.
01:41:18.945: >> CHAIR KLEINMAN, GO AHEAD. WHILE WE'RE ON THIS I WANTED TO TACK IN THE ONE THING THAT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THERE'S THE, YOU KNOW, STATE LAW ABOUT WHY THIS COMES BEFORE US. AND BUT IN PREVIOUS DISCUSSIONS JUST FOR TRANSPORTATION COMMISSIONERS TO KNOW, WE LIKE LOOKED AT THE THINGS THAT ARE ASSIGNED TO PLANNING. WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE THINGS SPECIFICALLY ABOUT ZONING WHICH IS NORMALLY IN OUR WHEEL HOUSE. TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN WORK TOGETHER, LIKE, I MEAN, I EXPECT THAT WE WILL NEED TO WORK TOGETHER GOING FORWARD FOR A LOT OF THESE THINGS BECAUSE THEY HAVE RIGHTFULLY BEEN SIGNED TO KIND OF O TO OUR REALM. THE ONE SMALL EDIT I WOULD MAKE BEFORE THIS GOES TO THE NEXT VERSION IS WHEN I DID THE QUICK CATCH ON ZONING JUST PREPARING FOR THIS MEETING, TO MAKE SURE I SAW ALL THOSE THINGS THE TRANSIT SUPPORTED DEVELOPMENT WHICH IS IN THERE, THERE'S A WEIRD TEXT THING AND IT'S NOT SHOWING UP. I CAUGHT TH THISVENING
01:42:18.871: >> IT'S IROC TT IT'S TNE THING - -
01:42:22.775: >> THE ONE THING YOU GUYS CARE ABOUT, I'M SORRY.
01:42:24.944: >> NOT THE ONE THING WE CARE ABOUT.  WE CARE ABOUT ALL THE THINGS.
01:42:28.314: >> NO, OF COURSE NOT.
01:42:29.382: >> BUT - - ALL RIGHT. SO I EXPECT, YOU KNOW, THIS IS... THIS IS HOLDING US TO WORKING TOGETHER AND WE WANT TO BE MAKING THE OTHER POLICY CHANGES THAT WE'VE PUT SO MUCH TIME AND EFFORT INTO, THAT YOU ALL HAVE PUT SO MUCH TIME AND EFFORT INTO. CHAIR KLEINMANAL.
01:42:53.239: >> THANK YOU. SO I JUST WANTED TO BRIEFLY EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE TO STAFF AND THE CONSULTING TEAM FOR THE WORK THAT'S GONE INTO THIS PLAN. I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT IT AND I ALSO JUST WANTED TO SHARE WITH OUR COLLEAGUES ON PLANNING THAT THIS CAME THROUGH TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION LIKE MORE THAN ONCE, WE HAD MEN A OPPORTUNITIES TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT, AND I WAS REALLY THRILLED TO BE ABLE TO WATCH THE EVOLUTION OF THE PLAN OVER TIME THE FEEDBACK, WE'RE IN IN INTRODUCTION 48ED INTO THIS PLAN IN REALLY CAREFUL WAYS. SO I FEEL VERY CONFIDENT IN THE PROCESS THAT GOT US HERE. I KNOW NOTHING IS EVER GOING TO BE PERFECT OR ADDRESSED EVERY SINGLE DETAIL. I APPRECIATE THE FLEXIBILITY HERE THAT IT LAYS OUT A VISION FOR US WITHOUT ALWAYS GETTING SO VERY SPECIFIC BUT IT REALLY GIVES US ROOM TO TAKE A VARIETY OF APPROACHES AS WE DEAL WITH REALITIES OF THE NEXT FEW YEARS. JUST SORT OF WANTED TO SHARE THAT BIT OF BACKGROUND FOR EVERYONE AND I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT IT.
01:44:06.045: >> I WANT TO NOTE THAT I'VE BEEN LOUSY AT HOLDING US TO 30 MINUTES. WE'RE NOW AT 40. ARE THERE ANY FINAL - - I THINK THAT'S A GREAT THING TO END ON BEFORE VOTING, BUT IS THERE ANY FINAL COMMENTS, QUESTIONS, CONCERNS? UM, MR. LENART, BUT I THINK IT MIGHT BE RELATED TO WHAT COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT IS RAISING HER HAND ON.
01:44:32.171: >> MR. LENART:  IT'S RELATED TO WHAT COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT SAID EARLIER. SO, UM, I JUST WANTED TO ON A COUPLE OF NOT SOLVE COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT'S CONCERNS, BUT MAYBE LEND SOME DEGREE OF COMFORT. THE CITY, FIRST OF ALL I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS BOT EQUITY AND EQUITABLE AND UNDERREPRESENTED VERSUS UNDERSERVED. I THINK THAT NOT UNLIKE A LOT OF OTHER COMMUNITIES WE ARE LEARNING NEW LANGUAGE AND WE'RE LEARNING OUR LOCAL HISTORY AND BEWHAT WE SHOULD DO BETTER GOING FORWARD.  TO THAT END, THE CITY IS STARTING AND IS RESOURCING AN INITIATIVE TO IMPROVE THE EQUITY OF OUR ENGAGEMENT ACROSS THE ORGANIZATION IN A VARIETY OF WAYS. SO WHETHER WHETHER OR NOT THOSE CONCERNS ARE, WHETHER OR NOT THERE WERE CHANGES MEMORIALIZED IN THIS DRAFT Y JUST WANT TO SHARE WITH COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT AND EVERYBODY OF COURSE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE CITY IS TAKING ON VERY SERIOUSLY AND SORT OF SPECIFICALLY. THERE'S A GROUP AT THE CITY THAT'S STARTING TO SORT OF, IN THE BEGINNING PHASES OF IT, WE ARE VERY SERIOUS ABOUT GETTING BETTER AT ENGAGEMENT TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE QUESTIONS THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT NOT ONLY NOT SPECIFIC TO TRANSPORTATION BUT AS THE CITY AS A WHOLE. SO, THAT IS A SMALL WAY OF SAYING EVEN IF NOT EVERYBODY SAYS CHANGE THE ORDER OF THE STRATEGIES, I JUST WANTED TO SHARE THAT WE HEAR THAT, AND THE CITY AS AN ORGANIZATION AND PARTICULARLY ADMINISTRATOR CRAWFORD IS INTERNALIZING THIS AND TASKING US WITH AN ORGANIZATION TO FRANK, FRANKLY, GET BETTER AT THIS.
01:46:46.438: >> GO AHEAD, COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT AND THEN COMMISSIONER PARSONS.
01:46:50.676: >> THANK YOU, I APPRECIATE THAT A LOT. I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THOSE TWO TERMS END UP IN THE GLOSSARY, WHATEVER - - THAT'S MY, I JUST THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THEY'RE DEFIND THERE. ARE DEFINITIONS OUT THERE FOR THEM, SO IT SHOULDN'T BE THAT HARD TO DO. BUT I'M REALLY EXCITED THE CITY IS DOING THIS.  MY ORGANIZATION IS TOO, AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ALL OF US LIKE IN THIS ENTIRE COUNTRY TO BE DOING THIS WORK SO THANK YOU.
01:47:15.234: >> COMMISSIONER PARSONS.
01:47:17.136: >> COMMISSIONER PARSONS:  THANK YOU, GUYS AND THANK YOU TO THE PRESENTERS, THANK YOU TO STAFF, AND PARTICULARLY TO CONSULTING GROUP, IT'S AN AMAZING DRAFT. I WANT TO PICK UP ON A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT WE'RE JUST DISCUSSING JUST NOW AND IN PROCESS. TO QUOTE ONE OF THE CALLERS WE NEED TO MOVE ON THIS AS FAST AS POSSIBLE, AND THEN TO QUOTE ANOTHER ONE WE'LL SEE WHAT THE FINAL DRAFT LOOKS LIKE. SO I'M TRYING TO BALANCE THESE AND SEE WHAT THE FINAL DRAFT LOOKS LIKE. INCLUDING GLOSSARY EDITIONS, AND DEFINITIONS THAT WE AGREE TO. YET Y DO VERY MUCH TRUST STAFF AND THE WORK THAT THEY'VE DONE ALREADY. TO GIVE ITS FINAL FIRM APPROVAL AS OPPOSED TO AN APPROVAL NOW WITH CONDITIONS?
01:48:14.927: >> SPEAKING FROM THE PLANNING COMMISSION FOR THE PLANNING COMMISSION BECAUSE I FEEL ALL-POWERFUL, I THINK THAT WOULD MOST LIKELY - - I'M GUESSING THE NATURE OF THESE CHANGES ARE SUCH THAT THEY COULD BE INCORPORATED RELATIVELY QUICKLY.  IF THAT WAS THE DESIRE OF THE PLANNING COMMISSION, SPEAKING FOR THEM, I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT THEY POSTPONE THIS TO THE MAY AGENDA ALTHOUGH THAT WILL BE BE A ROBUST AGENDA.  I THINK THE BULK OF THESE CHANGES ARE PROBABLY JUST GOING TO BE SEEN AND GETTING INCORPORATED INTO THE DRAFT. THAT WILL GENERALLY PUT THE PLAN STILL ON TRACK FOR JUNE PRESENTATION TO THE CITY COUNCIL.  I WOULD ALSO APPRECIATE MR. COOPER'S PERSPECTIVE AS WELL.  BECAUSE THIS IS IN MANY WAYS... HIS BABY.
01:49:13.752: >> GO AHEAD, MR. COOPER.
01:49:15.287: >> JUST LOOKING FOR THE UNMUTE BUTTON, SORRY. SO, I THINK THAT THERE'S A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT WAYS AND IT REALLY IS THE COMFORT OF THE BOARDS WHAT YOU CAN DO IS CONDITIONALLY APPROVE IT, I THINK, MR. LENART'S CORRECT THAT STACEY AND I WILL BANG THAT LANGUAGE OUT PRETTY QUICKLY HERE. THE ISSUE IS WOULD YOU EMPOWER US AND YOUR REPRESENTATIVES, MEANING MR. LENART, MS. COLEMAN, WE COULD SHARE THE LANGUAGE WITH THEM AND THEY COULD CIRCULATE IT TO YOU SO THAT YOU'RE OKAY WITH HAVING AUTHORIZED IT TONIGHT AND THEN ALLOW US TO BRING IT TO COUNCIL OR, AND WHERE CAN'T SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION AND THEIR SCHEDULE, I THINK THEY MEET ALSO LATER IN MAYOR SO BOTH BODIES COULD HAVE AN OFFICIAL BITE OF THE APPLE BUT EITHER WAY THE TYPES OF CHANGES THAT WE'RE THINKING ABOUT ARE MINOR WORD AMENDMENTS THAT COULD BE DONE FAIRLY QUICKLY. CAN'T DO IT HERE AT THE TABLE, AT THIS JUNCTURE, BUT I WOULD EXPECT THAT VERY QUICKLY WE'LL HAVE LANGUAGE AND IT'S AT THE DISCUSSION OF THE BODIES AS TO WHETHER THEY WANT TO EMPOWER STAFF TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE DIRECTION YOU'RE GIVING US, AND WITH HOT WE'VE ALREADY COMMITTED TO. OR COMPEL US TO BRING IT BACK.
01:50:55.287: >> COMMISSIONER.
01:51:00.626: >> COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN:  I'M COMFORTABLE MOVING FORWARD. THIS IS NOT UNUSUAL FOR THE PLANNING COMMISSION TO LET STAFF FIGURE OUT THINGS BEFORE IT GOES TO CITY COUNCIL SO I'M I CAN AM PERFECTLY COMFORTABLE, AT LEAST FROM THE PLANNING COMMISSION END, VOTING ON IT THIS EVENING.
01:51:14.840: >> I'M SEEING SOME NODS. I HAVE MS. COLEMAN, AND THEN I SAW COMMISSIONER GIBB RANDALL AND CHECK BACK IN WITH - - NO. IGNORE COMMISSIONER GIBB RANDALL. GO AHEAD.
01:51:30.722: >> I JUST WANTED TO CHIME IN WITH ONE MORE PROCESS CONSIDERATION, AND I DON'T KNOW IF MR. LENART ALREADY ADDRESSED THIS, MY INTERNET WAS CUTTING OUT A BIT. IN TERMS OF PROCESS, IF THIS WERE TO COME TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION IN THE EARLY MAY MEETING THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION DOES NOT MEET AGAIN UNTIL MAYOR 19 WHICH IS AFTER BOTH THE PLANNING COMMISSION'S MAY MEETINGS SO IT'S THEN TYPICAL THAT THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION RECOMMEND SOMETHING TO PLANNING COMMIIO AND CITY COUNCIL AND IF THE ACTION IS NOT TAKEN TONIGHT JUST SO THAT IT'S CLEAR TO ALL THAT IT WOULD BE LIKELY THAT THE PLANNING COMMISSION WOULD ACT FIRST, AND THEN THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION WOULD COME LATER SO THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION WOULD BE RECOMMENDING JUST TO CITY COUNCIL OR THEY CAN MAKE THE STATEMENT TO PLANNING COMMISSION BUT AT THAT POINT IT WOULD BE SYMBOLIC, IT WOULD BE PAST THE POINT OF THEIR ACTION.
01:52:28.580: >> CAN I GABE MAYBE GET SOME QUICK THUMBS UP IF WE FEEL COMFORTABLE INTERRUPT ENTRUSTING STAFF TO MAKE THESE REVISIONS WE'VE DONE ON OTHER THINGS?  I SEE A COUPLE OF THUMBS.  A FEW THUMBS.  SO I THINK BOTH COMMISSIONS IT SOUNDS LIKE ARE GOOD WITH MOVING THIS FORWARD TONIGHT.
01:52:48.400: >> ANYTHING ELSE FOR STAFF AND I WANT TO JUST CHECK IN WITH STAFF AND MAKE SURE YOU GOT - - YOU TAKE GOOD NOTES. I ES, GO AHEAD.
01:52:56.975: >> I APPRECIATE THAT I JUST WANTED TO HAVE A TOUCH POINT. I AM IN MY MIND THE DRAFT INCORPORATES ALL THE CHANGES THAT MS. MEEKINS ALREADY PRESENTED AS PART OF HER PRESENTATION. WE ARE ADDING EQUITY AND EQUITABLE TO THE GLOSS AREA, TO CLEARLY DEFINE THOSE,. STRIKING LANGUAGE ON PAGE 37 PERCENT - - 37. AND I AM NOT - - REGARDING CHANGING THE ORDER OF THE STRATEGIES CHANGING UNDERREP REPRESENT REPPED OR ANY FURTHER LANGUAGE ON TRANSIT SERVICE ON SUNDAYS AND OTHERS TIMES. THAT'S MY FULLER OF WHAT I'M HEARING. THAT IS THE SET OF CHANGES SHOULD WE PROCEED SEED.
01:54:10.949: >> BRIGS.
01:54:12.384: >> GO AHEAD MS.
01:54:14.119: >> I WOULD ADD ONE AND I DON'T KNOW THAT IT NEEDS TO BEAID BUT THE CHANG THAT COMMISSIONER MILLS POINTED OUT TO AEXT ANGE RELEVANT T TRAIT SUPPORTEDONING. MMISONER MILLS SOMETIMES.
01:54:31.203: >> YEAH.  SO DO MY KIDS.  GO AHEAD, COMMISSIONER BRIGS.
01:54:35.240: >> I THINK ALSO ON PAGE 129 THERE MIGHT ALSO BE SOMETHING ABOUT LANE REDUCTION, LANE CONFIGURATIONS AND I'M NOT LOOKING AT THAT RIGHT NOW. THAT'S ASSOCIATED LANGUAGE THAT CAN BE JUST BROADENED A LITTLE BIT.
01:54:52.190: >> I DID LOOK AT THAT ONE, I JUST WANT TO TOUCH ON THAT. BECAUSE IT DOES SAY IT SAYS EG STREET RESURFACING OR RECONSTRUCTION. THAT'S ALREADY BROADER THAN THE OTHER ONE.
01:55:10.542: >> JUST KIND OF BROADEN NOT JUST GREAT AND THEN THE OTHER PIECE, SUPPORT FOR INTEREST AND OTHERS TO MOVE TO. I DON'T MEAN AS A FORMAL EVALUATION, BUT THOUGHTFUL. BEFORE EXPANDING THE PROGRAM.  I THINK -T PROGRAM THERE HAVE BEEN QUESTIONS ABOUT IT FROM THE COMMUNITY IN THE PAST. I THINK IT'S WORTH TAKING A LOOK AT OUR EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS BEFORE EXPANDING THEM.
01:56:07.599: >> I APPRECIATE THE COMMENT RELATED TO THE A2B. THIS IS ONE -F THOSE OLD-FASHIONED DILEMMAS. ON ONE HAND THE CITY HAS MODELED A PROGRAM THAT CITY-WIDE, COMMUNITY-WIDE, ALL ENCOMPASSING, AND THEN WE HAVE OUR OWN UNIQUE NEEDS WITHIN THE TRANSPORTATION WORLD. I WANT TO AT LEAST ARTICULATE TO THE COUNCIL MEMBER THAT WE WORK WITH COMMUNICATIONS EXPERTS IN ORDER TO DEVELOP THE MESSAGING AROUND OUR TRANSPORTATION. WE WILL HANG IT UNDER THE BROADER UMBRELLA OF A2B BUT I DO NOT BELIEVE IT'S BEING DRIVEN BOY THE SAME MODELS OF THE A2B SAFE BUT IT'S THAT BRANDING THAT THE COMMUNITY HAS WHEN WE DISCUSS SAFETY.
01:56:58.283: >> NOT ENTIRELY, BUT I'LL JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT.
01:57:06.858: >> COMMISSIONER DISCH.
01:57:09.261: >> I WANTED TO JUST SAY THAT GIVEN THAT THE WORD UNDERREPRESENTED IS BEING USED IN THE CONTEXT OF ENGAGEMENT AND THE NEED TO DO EXTRA OUTREACH, I THINK IT IS THE APPROPRIATE WORD IT STRIKES ME AS THE APPROPRIATE WORD BECAUSE THE CONCERN IS WITH REPRESENTATION NOT SERVICE PROVISION, IT REALLY IS WITH VOICE AND ADVOCACY. SO UNDERREPRESENTED STRIKE MIS - - STRIKES ME AS OKAY, BUT HAPPILY HEAR I HAVE NOT CAPTURED THE HEART AND SOUL OF COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT'S CONCERN.
01:57:49.768: >> GO FOR IT.
01:57:52.037: >> I THINK IT MIGHT BE FINE.  I THINK IT MIGHT BE WORTH TRYING TO DEFINE, THOUGH.  SO WHEN I WON'T SAY LIKE I DEFINITELY THINK IT NEEDS TO BE IN THERE, BUT I THINK IT MIGHT BE WORTH STAFF CONSIDERATION AND DISCUSSION ON WHETHER OR NOT IT SHOULD BE EXPLORED A LITTLE BIT MORE AND EXPAND UPON THE GLOSSARY TO SAY EXACTLY WHAT WE NEED BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY TERMS THAT ARE OUT THERE RIGHT NOW. SO IT MIGHT JUST HELP CLARIFY. PRETTY SURE THAT'S PROBABLY RIGHT.
01:58:18.363: >> THERE'S A QUESTION THAT'S WORTHWHILE FOR US TO INCLUDE IN THE GLOSSARY JUST TO BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT OUR INTENTION THAT VOICES THAT WE DON'T, IT'S A SEGMENT OF OUR COMMUNITY THAT WE'RE NOT HEARING FROM. SO WE WILL I THINK ADDING THAT TO THE GLOSSARY MAKES SENSE.
01:58:34.179: >> OKAY. AND I, YOU GUYS DON'T HAVE TO CHANGE THE ORDER, I'M NOT SAYING YOU HAVE TO CHANGE THE ORDER, I WAS JUST TRYING TO MAKE A POINT.
01:58:44.589: >> WE DO OUR BEST TO MAKE EVERYBODY HAPPY.
01:58:48.460: >> ONE POINT ON THE EQUITY EQUITABLE ENGAGEMENT, I RECOGNIZE THAT COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT'S POINT THAT THERE ARE LOTS LOTS OF DEFINITIONS OUT THERE, BUT AS MR. LENART POINTED OUT THERE IS AN EQUITABLE ENGAGEMENT INITIATIVE KICKING UH AND PART OF THAT IS TO REACH AGREEMENT ON HOW THIS COMMUNITY IS DEFINING EQUITABLE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT. AND WE ACTUALLY AREN'T THERE YET WHERE WE DON'T HAVE A DEFINITION AS A COMMUNITY FOR THAT. SO I SUPPORT THAT WE LOOK INTO THIS FURTHER, WE SEE WHAT DEFINITIONS ARE OUT THERE FROM REPUTABLE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT ORGANIZATIONS THAT WE MIGHT LOOK TO AS AT LEAST A STARTING POINT WHILE WE HAVE NOT YET AS A COMMUNITY DEFINED THAT TERM. BUT I JUST WANT TO WHEN WE AGREE WE'RE GOING TO LET STAFF LOOK, IF THE AGREE.  FROM THE COMMISSION IS THAT THEY LET STAFF LOOK INTO THIS THAT WE HAVE SOME FLEXIBILITY TO SEE LIKE FOR EXAMPLE THAT MAYBE AT THAT TIME WE CAN DEFINE AS INCLUSIVE PARTICIPATION, BECAUSE I PULLED OUT PUBLIC PARTICIPATION THAT WE FOLLOW IN THE EAT AND THAT'S THE TERM THAT WE DO HAVE A DEFINITION FOR IS INCLUSIVE PARTICIPATION.  SO JUST HAVING SOME FLEXIBILITY THERE IS WHAT I WOULD REQUEST. IF THE COMMISSIONS FEEL STRONGLY THERE NEEDS TO BE SOMETHING SAID ABOUT EQUITY, EQUITABLE ENGAGEMENT, WE'LL LOOK FOR THAT, BUT JUST KNOW THAT THERE IS AN INITIATIVE OF US PLANNING TO WORK WITH THE COMMUNITY TO COME UP WITH DEFINITIONS WE CAN AGREE TO AS A COMMUNITY.
02:00:20.885: >> WHY DON'T WE DO BOTH? LET'S ALSO, I'M SURE WE CAN APUT A FOOTNOTE OR SOMETHING IN THAT ACK KNOWLEDGES THIS COMING INITIATIVE OF THE CITY AND ENDORSES THAT. SORT OF RECOGNIZES THAT IT'S A VALUE OF THIS PLAN AND JUST SORT OF I'M NOT SAYING THAT THIS PLAN SETS US ON THAT COURSE, BUT I THINK WE CAN FIND A WAY TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IS UNDERWAY, AND THAT PROCESS MIGHT HELP TO DEFINE THAT MORE FULLY FOR THE -
02:00:49.447: >> SURE, THAT WORKS FOR ME.
02:00:54.152: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT, REALLY QUICK, I'M DOING A LOUSY JOB KEEPING US TO NINE O'CLOCK.
02:00:58.890: >> THIS IS WHY OUR MEETINGS GO SO LONG. SO I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY, I'M PERFECTLY COMFORTABLE GIVING STAFF FLEXIBILITY. I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY I'M NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT, I'M TALKING ABOUT EQUITY AS A BROAD TERM AND SPECIFICALLY EQUITY VERSUS EQUALITY, AND WHERE THINK THAT CAN BE WORKED INTO THE DEFINITION.  I HAVE ONE IN THE REPORT THAT I'M FACING IN A MONTH FACING IN A MONTH. AND JUST HOW THAT'S IMPORTANT IN THE COMMUNITY SO IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT PARTICIPATION AND ENGAGEMENT, IT'S JUST YOU KNOW HOW THAT IMPACTS ALL OF THE DECISIONS THAT WE'RE MAKING A ASS A COMMUNITY AND NOW I'M GOING TO STOP TALK.
02:01:37.028: >> COMMISSIONER DISCH YOU HAD YOUR HAND UP. CLOSING THOUGHTS?  OKAY. CHAIR KLEINMAN, DO YOU WANT TO TAKE THE - -
02:01:45.503: >> OH, YEAH, ALL RIGHT, LET ME FIGURE OUT - -
02:01:47.505: >> I ACTUALLY HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION.
02:01:49.607: >> YES, ESPECIALLY SINCE YOU'RE THE EDITOR OF IT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE GOOD INSTRUCTIONS.
02:01:55.480: >> I AM UNCLEAR WHERE WE LANDED ON THE A2B SAFE.
02:02:04.956: >> THIS SEEMS LIKE THERE'S FOLKS ON TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION THAT HAVE MUCH STRONGER OPINIONS THAN I CERTAINLY HAVE SEEN AMONG PLANNING COMMISSIONERS. SO. WHAT I HEARD WAS, WELL, I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT IT. GO AHEAD, COMMISSIONER HESS.
02:02:30.148: >> YEAH, MAYBE IF I'D CAN - - I COULD JUST TAKE A MOMENT TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS.  WE ARE LOOKING AT THE BROADEN THE PROGRAM GET FUNDED THROUGH COUNCIL. LOOKING AT SOME OTHER MODELS THAT WE CAN USE.  FOR EXAMPLE GRAND RAPIDS HAD A FAIRLY SUCCESSFUL CAMPAIGN CALLED DRIVING CHANGE THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE ALREADY BEEN IN DISCUSSIONS WITH THEM. THE OTHER THING I WANT TO NOTE, PART OF THE BE SAFE CAMPAIGN, WHILE I APPRECIATE THAT WASN'T QUITE, IF WE HAD PIGGER BUDGET WE - - BIGGER BUDGETS WE CAN REACH MORE PEOPLE AND BROADEN OUR MESSAGING. I WANT TO REMIND EVERYONE THAT THAT THE WASSING DRIVING BEHAVIOR PART OF THE BE SAFE CAMPAIGN WHERE WE MEASURED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DIFFERENT PROPES FOR VEHICLES STOPPING FOR PEDESTRIANS IN THE CROSS WALK, THERE WAS AN ENFORCEMENT PIECE, AN EDUCATION PIECE, ENCOURAGEMENT PIECE. I THINK WHAT WE'LL DO IS TAKE THE LESSONS LEARNED FROM THAT AND BROADEN THEM, ESPECIALLY IF WE HAVE THAT BUDGET SUPPORT MOVING FORWARD. I DON'T THINK WE'LL JUST BLOW OFF THE DUST OFF AN OLD CAMPAIGN AND THEN CALL IT DONE. I DO WANT TO REASSURE YOU THAT THERE'S A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO KIND OF EACH NEW - - REACH NEW AUDIENCES AND USE MESSAGE MATERIALS TO HONE IN ON THE MESSAGE WE WANT OUT IN THE COMMUNITY. WE'D BE ALL EARS, TOO. YOU GO, IF THERE'S SUGGESTIONS FROM TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION, PLANNING COMMISSION, OR OTHERS IN THE COMMUNITY, AND THINGS THEY WOULD LIKE US TO SEE, I'M SURE WE CAN BE RECEPTIVE TO THOSE AS WELL. SO.
02:04:00.205: >> COMMISSIONER I THINK I SAW YOUR HAND?  NO.  CALLING IT OFF. ALL RIGHT. DOES THAT PROVIDE BETTER DIRECTION? FOR WHAT TO DO WITH THIS?  I MEAN, I HEARD BOTH, LIKE, WHAT'S ACTUALLY IN THE WORKS WHAT STAFF HAS IN THE WORKS THIS IS OUTSIDE OF INTERPRETATION WHAT STAFF HAS IN THE WORKS MIGHT NOT MATCH EXACTLY WHAT THE LANGUAGE IS IN HERE.  WHAT I'M READING FROM THE PLAN IS WE'RE EXPANDING THIS BE SAFE PROGRAM WHICH IS THAT'S WHAT I HEARD WAS THE CONCERN INSTEAD IT WAS EXPAND EDUCATION MAYBE A PART OF BE SAFE.
02:04:40.478: >> YEAH, I THINK ELI AND RAYMOND AND I CAN WORK ON AN EDIT TO RECOGNIZE THE WORK THAT'S ALREADY UNDERWAY AND THAT WOULD ADDRESS COMMISSIONER BRIGS.
02:04:50.655: >> JUST REALLY QUICKLY, TO BUILD ON COMMISSIONER HESS' OBSERVATION AND WHAT THE COUNCIL MEMBER BRIGS HAD OUTLINED WHAT'S NOT IN THE PLAN IS DISCUSSION ABOUT AN EVALUATION MATRIX SO THAT WE'RE NOT ONLY EXPANDING THE CAMPAIGN MESSAGING BUT THAT WE HAVE METRICS TO EVALUATE HOW EFFECTIVE OUR INVESTMENTS ARE. ARE WE HITTING THE TARGETS OR MAKING THE CHANGES? I SEE THAT AS A MAJOR OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A MINOR ADJUSTMENT TO THE LANGUAGE IN THE PLAN. TO EMPHASIZEIZE BECAUSE THAT WAS WHAT WE DID WITH THE CHANGE IN DRIVING BEHAVIOR WAS WE ADDED ALL THOSE METRICS TO HOW EFFECTIVE WAS IT AT THE END. I THINK, I SEE SOME POSITIVE NODDING SO I THINK THAT'S THE DIRECTION THAT WE'LL BE MOVING TOWARDS.
02:05:43.408: >> OKAY. MS. MEEKINS, YOU'RE GOOD NOW? AWESOME. ANYTHING ELSE? GO FOR IT, CHAIR KLEINMAN.
02:05:54.018: >> I THINK I AM JUST GOING TO HAND IT STRAIGH OVER TO MS. COLEMAN FOR A ROLL CALL VOTE.
02:06:01.726: >> ALL RIGHT. I'LL CALL YOUR NAME, AND PLEASE INDICATE YOUR VOTE. I GUESS YES OR NO FOR THE MOTION THAT HAS BEEN READ. COMMISSIONER BOLAND.
02:06:17.775: >> YES.
02:06:19.110: >> COUNCIL MEMBER BRIGS.
02:06:21.012: >> YES.
02:06:21.646: >> COMMISSIONER PHELPS [NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE]
02:06:29.887: >> NODDING.

02:06:49.440: >> COMMISSIONER SMITH.
02:06:53.311: >> YES.
02:06:53.745: >> IT PASSES UNANIMOUSLY.
02:06:57.415: >> BACK TO YOU, CHAIR MILLS.
02:07:01.085: >> MR. LENART, CAN WE HAVE A ROLL CALL VOTE PLEASE?
02:07:03.388: >> YES, FOR THE MOTIONS ARE AS READ WITH THE CHANGES DISCUSSED. COMMISSIONER MILLS.

02:07:33.418: >> COMMISSIONER LEE.
02:07:38.790: >> YES.
02:07:40.324: >> COMMISSIONER CLARKE.
02:07:40.892: >> YES.
02:07:42.060: >> CARRIES UNANIMOUSLY.
02:07:43.761: >> BACK OVER TO YOU, CHAIR KLEINMAN.
02:07:46.097: >> OKAY, THANK YOU, SO NOW WE'RE MOVING ON TO HEALTHY STREETS WHICH WE'RE GOING TO START WITH A PRESENTATION FROM STAFF AND DO IT THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION WAY WHICH IS TO DISCUSS THEN HAVE OUR MOTION, AND YEAH, I THINK OVER TO YOU, I'M NOT SURE WHO'S GIVING THIS ONE, IF IT'S RAYMOND OR ELI.
02:08:10.054: >> RAYMOND.
02:08:11.022: >> GREAT, THANKS.
02:08:22.133: >> OKAY, IS MY SCREEN SHOWING PROPERLY HERE?
02:08:24.135: >> IT IS SHOWING, AND IT IS NOT IN PRESENTATION VIEW AT THIS POINT.
02:08:28.339: >> THERE WE GO.
02:08:29.140: >> THERE WE WE GO.
02:08:30.508: >> ALL RIGHT, UH, COMMISSIONERS RAYMOND HIS TRANSPORTATION MANAGER FOR THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR AND I'LL TAKE A FEW MOMENTS OF YOUR TIME TO TALK ABOUT THE HEALTHY STREETS PROGRAM. AS A REMIND TO EVERYONE ON THE CALL OBVIOUSLY WE'RE OPEN TO DISCUSSION FROM ALL COMMISSIONERS BUT THIS ITEM IS SPECIFIC TO THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION WHAT WE ARE SEEKING TODAY IS A RECOMMEND ASIAN FROM THEDATION RECOMMENDATION FROM THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION TO CITY COUNCIL. BEFORE I GET INTO THE PRESENTATION A VERY BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE HISTORY, HEALTHY STREETS WERE LAUNCHED LAST YEAR IN RESPONSE TO COVID-19 IN THE - - WHAT THIS LEAD TO WAS A SUITE OF PROJECTS THAT KIND OF RECONFIGURED ROADWAYS AND MADE NEIGHBORHOOD STREET CLOSED TO THROUGH TRAFFIC TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO WALK AND BIKE SAFELY AND ALLOW FOR SAFE SOCIAL DISTANCING.  BASED ON A RECOMMENDATION FROM THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION BACK IN DECEMBER TO REUP THE PROGRAM IN 2021, WE WENT TO CITY COUNCIL. THEY AUTHORIZED SOME DESIGN FUNDING IN JANUARY AND SO WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE TODAY IS A RESULT OF SEVERAL MONTHS OF PLANNING, DESIGN, AND OUTREACH IN TERMS OF WHAT IS BEING PROPOSED TO MOVE FORWARD TO CITY COUNCIL. A CUP OPPORTUNITIES FOR LANE THINGS.  COVID-19, - - THERE'S AN ALIGNMENT OF OUR CARBON NEUTRALITY GOALS.
02:10:33.831: >> THE MERCHANT ASSOCIATION DOWNTOWN CLOSURES, WEEKEND INTERMITTENT DOWNTOWN CLOSURES, PLACES LIKE THAT, THOSE ARE COORDINATED SEPARATELY THROUGH THE MERCHANT ASSOCIATIONS. WE DO COORDINATE WITH THEM ON THAT. WE'RE ACTUALLY COORD NEUTRALITYING WITH THEM RIGHT NOW ON AN ISSUE. SO THEY ARE A SEPARATE BUT THEY ARE A COORDINATED EFFORT. SIMILARLY THE DEFENDANT DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITIES PEOPLE FRIENDLY STREET PROGRAM IS CURRENTLY UNDERGOING PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT ON THEIR EFFORTS. THEY HAD SOME ENGAGEMENT OPPORTUNITIES I BELIEVE IN MARCH AND THERE WILL BE ANOTHER ROUND IN THE FUTURE. AND SO THOSE ARE ALSO AN EXTENSION OF HEALTHY STREETS AND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WERE DONE LAST YEAR BUT MAYBE GOING THROUGH A DIFFERENT PROCESS AND ALONG A DIFFERENT TRACK. THE 2021 PROGRAM THAT I'M GOING TO BE DISCUSSING TODAY IS SPECIFICALLY FOCUSED ON KIND OF TWO ISSUE AREAS, THE FIRST IS THE RECONFIGURATIONS ON OUR MATERIALS AND THE SECOND IS THE NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS. WE HAVE THREE ARTERIAL PROGRAMS THE FIRST ONE I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT IS SOUTH MAIN STREET FROM WILLIAM TO STADIUM. LAST YEAR YOU MAY RECALL SO MAIN STREET AS I'M SURE ALL OF YOU ARE AWARE IS TWO-LANES IN EACH DIRECTION. WHAT WE DID LAST YEAR IS WE TOOK THE OUTSIDE LANE AND KIND OF TURNED IT INTO A BIKE LANE. THAT WAS DONE WITH CONES AND WHAT WE LEARNED FROM THAT DEPLOYMENT IS A COUPLE OF THINGS. FIRST OF ALL, THERE WAS A NEGATIVE REACTION TO THE MATERIALS WE USED, A LOT OF PEOPLE COMPLAINED THE CONES AND BARRICADES MADE IT FEEL LIKE A CONSTRUCTION ZONE, AND LEAD TO SOME CONFUSION AND AMBIGUITY. WE'VE ADDRESSED THAT BY INSTEAD OF USING CONES WE'RE GOING TO PUT IN INROAD DELINEATORS SO THOSE ARE THESE KIND OF PLASTIC, YOU KNOW, - - IN THE ROADWAY, SOMEWHERE TO WHAT YOU MIGHT SEE ON WILLIAM STREET OR THOSE CROSS WALK SIGNS, PROBABLY CLOSER TO THE CROSS WALK SIGNS THAT YOU SEE WHAT WE CALL THE R1 DASH 6 GATEWAY TREATMENTS. THOSE ARE THE MATERIALS THAT WE'RE PROPOSING TO USE THROUGHOUT THIS PROJECT. THE OTHER THING YOU'LL NOTE ON THE DESIGN THAT YOU'LL SEE IN FRONT OF YOU IS INSTEAD OF TAKING THE OUTSIDE LANE, WE'RE ACTUALLY PROPOSING A COMPLETE LANE CONFIGURATION TO A MORE TRADITIONAL WHAT WE WOULD CALL ROAD DIET. INSTEAD OF TWO-LANES IN EACH DIRECTION, THIS WOULD BE ONE LANE IN EACH DIRECTION WITH A CENTER TURN LANE THAT YOU CAN SEE HERE IN THE MIDDLE, AND THEN THERE'S A BUFFER PROTECTED BIKE LANE AGAINST THE CURB GOING IN EACH DIRECTION. THIS WAS AN IMPORTANT MODIFICATION BECAUSE THAT ADDITION OF THAT CENTER TURN LANE WE THINK WILL ALLEVIATE SOME OF THE CONGESTION THAT WAS OCCURRING. IF YOU EXPERIENCED MAIN STREET LAST YEAR A CAR TURNING ON TO HILL OR HOOVER OR PAULINE, SINCE THERE WAS NO KED DEKATE - - NO DEDICATED TURN LANE THAT WOULD BACKUP TRAFFIC. THE ADDITION OF THE CENTER TURN LANE DOES HELP WITH SAFETY AND IT DOES HELP WITH MOBILITY ISSUES FOR ALL USERS.  SO THIS IS KIND OF A BIG CHANGE FROM WHAT WE SAW LAST YEAR. I WILL NOTE THAT THIS DEPLOYMENT IS PROPOSED TO BE TEMPORARY. SO IF THIS GETS APPROVED BY COUNCIL IT WOULD RUN FROM ROUGHLY MAY TO NOVEMBER. WE WOULD BE, THEY WOULD BE PULLED UP IN PREPARATION FOR WINTER. BUT I WILL ACKNOWLEDGE, TOO, THAT IF THE PROGRAM IS VERY SUCCESSFUL, IF THE ROAD SEEMS TO BE OPERATING WELL, YOU KNOW, WE WOULD EVALUATE IT AND CONTEMPLATE IT FOR FUTURE PERMANENT INSTALLATION. RIGHT NOW IT IS BEING PROPOSED AS A TEMPORARY PILOT PROJECT. THE NEXT SEGMENT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT IS NORTH PACKARD BETWEEN HILL AND STATE. THIS IS ALMOST IDENTICAL TO LAST YEAR'S DEPLOYMENT WHERE WE TOOK AWAY THE TURN LANE IN FAVOR OF RESTORING A BIKE LANE. THE BIKE LANE WAS REMOVED AS PART OF A DETOUR PLAN SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND WAS NEVER REINSTALLED. THIS FILLS IN A CRITICAL BACK IN THE BIKE NETWORK. IT'S JUST REALLY ONE BLOCK ABOUT 400 FEET LONG, BUT IT'S KIND OF A CRUCIAL BLOCK AND RESTORING THAT WILL SERVE A KEY GAP OR FILL A KEY GAP IN THE BIKE NETWORK. THIS IS BEING PROPOSED TO BE PERMANENT AND WE ARE ACTUALLY GETTING QUOTES AS WELL TO RESURFACE THE BIKE LANE. WE KNOW THIS SEGMENT OF PACKARD, THE PAVEMENT CONDITION IS NOT IN THE BEST CONDITION BUT THE ROAD IS NOT UP FOR RESURFACING FOR SEVERAL YEARS OUT. SO WE ARE PLANNING ON PUTTING IN RESURFACING OF JUST THE BIKE LANE AS PART OF THIS PROJECT. THEN THAT WAY THE PAVEMENT MARKING STICK AND THAT FACILITY BECOMES MORE COMFORTABLE AS WELL. THE THIRD ARTERIAL PROGRAM IS EAST PACKARD BETWEEN EISENHOWER AND THE EASTERN CITY LIMITS. THIS REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE TO LAST YEAR'S DEPLOYMENT AS WELL. AGAIN YOU MAY RECALL LAST YEAR WE TOOK THIS 5-LANE ROAD TWO-LANES IN EACH DIRECTION WITH THE CENTER TURN LANE. LAST YEAR WE TOOK AWAY THE OUTSIDE LANE, SO WE KIND OF TURNED IT INTO A THREE-LANE ROADWAY WITH A VERY WIDE BIKE LANE. THERE WAS SOME NEGATIVE REACTION TO THAT, AND WHAT WE DID WAS WE WENT BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD TO SEE HOW MUCH ROOM WE HAD ON THE ROADWAY AND WE FOUND OUT THAT IF WE NARROWED THE LANES TO ABOUT 10 FEET EACH, WE COULD SQUEEZE OUT ENOUGH ROOM TO PUT IN A BIKE LANE. ONE THING I WILL NOTE IS THIS IS A BIKE LANE, NOT PROTECTED OR BUFFERED BIKE LANE LIKE I SHOWED YOU WITH THE PREVIOUS EXAMPLES. SO THIS ISN'T GOING TO HAVE THE HIGH COMFORT FACILITY WE TALKED ABOUT IN SOME OF OUR PAST DISCUSSIONS.  PORTIONS OF THE SECTION OF EAST PACKARD DO HAVE A SIDE PATH SO FOR THOSE THAT ARE NOT AS COMFORTABLE RIDING IN THAT DESIGN DO HAVE SOME OTHER OPTIONS AS WELL. THIS AGAIN IS RESPONSIVE TO SOME OF THE CONCERNS WE HEARD ABOUT CONGESTION SINCE THIS IS ONE OF THE MAJOR ARTERIALS INTO THE COMMUNITY. MOVING ON TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD SLOW STREETS, THIS IS A BIG LONG LIST SO I WON'T GO OVER IT IN ANY DETAIL BUT I DID WANT TO LET YOU KNOW LAST YEAR'S PROGRAM INCLUDED 26 LOCATIONS, THAT HAS BEEN INCREASED TO 34 LOCATIONS. WE ADDED EIGHT ADDITIONAL LOCATIONS BASED ON SOME OF THE PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT WE CONDUCTEDDED. SOUTH REVENA WAS ONE OF THE NEW ADDITIONS.  THERE WERE SOME STAFF-DRIVEN EXAMPLESS AS WELL WHERE LAST YEAR ONE OF THE COMPLAINTS OR CONCERNS OF THE PROGRAM WAS THAT IF A STREET GOT A NEIGHBORHOOD SLOW STREET TREATMENT AND THE NEXT STREET OVER A PARALLEL STREET DID NOT GET IT, THERE WAS KIND OF A SPILLOVER TRAFFIC EFFECT.  WE WENT THROUGH AND LOOKED AT ROADWAYS FOR EXAMPLE THAT WERE IMMEDIATELY ADJACENT TO ANOTHER ROAD IN THE PROGRAM AND WENT AHEAD AND INCLUDED THOSE AS WELL. A GOOD EXAMPLE IS ROSEWOOD. JEWITT AND OTHER ROADS ARE IN THE SAME NETWORK SO INCLUDED ROSEWOOD THIS TIME AROUND IS MEANT TO BE RESPONSIVE TO MINIMIZING THAT SPILLOVER EFFECT.
02:29:56.092: >> AND ADDED TO A LOT OF CONGESTION SO SINCE THERE'S WORK BEING DONE ON THE BROADWAY BRIDGE AND CONNECTING TO AN EXISTING FACILITIES SILT AS PART OF THE DIVISION PROJECT WE DID NOT PURSUE DIVISION OR EVEN THE SWIFT PONTIAC CORNER UP THERE AS WELL. GOOD QUESTION. WE'RE NOT PURSUING IT THIS YORE, BUT THAT'S NUT TO - - THAT'S NUT TO SAY IT CAN'T BE PURSUED IN THE FUTURE.
02:30:22.252: >> COMMISSIONER CLARKE.
02:30:23.086: >> OKAY, I'VE FOUGHT A QUICK FOLLOW-UP. SORRY.  WE USE THAT BROADWAY AND DIVISION LAST YEAR BECAUSE IT'S PRETTY MUCH THE ONLY WAY IT CONNECTED THE NORTH SIDE INTO TOWN SO WITHOUT THAT CONNECTOR WE'RE KIND OF ON A LITTLE ISLAND OVER THERE AND IT MAKES THE REST OF THE HEALTHY STRTS LESS USEFUL. ALRNATCONNECTO THEE E CONSIDERED A IF THE'S DAT TO BACP THE TRAFFIC IT LAIDS AND HOW PROLONGED THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN OR WHAT TIME THEY WERE CAUSED.
02:31:04.327: >> GREAT QUESTION, THERE IS A VERY EXTENSIVE REPORT WE PRODUCED OUR STAFFS WELL AS THE DDA STAFF PUT TOGETHER IS AVAILABLE ON THE HEALTHY STREETS WEBSITE. IF YOU EVER REALLY WANT TO GO INTO IT, IT DOES TALK ABOUT SOME OF THAT VEHICULAR DELAY. ONE OF THE THINGS I WILL NOTE IS WE WEREN'T FULLY ABLE TO EVALUATE THE BROADWAY BRIDGE PROJECT OR THE EAST PACKARD PROJECT OR PARTS OF SOUTH MAIN BECAUSE THOSE WERE CITY COUNCIL DECIDED TO PULL THOSE BACK EARLIER FROM THE FULL DEPLOYMENT, WHICH IS FINE, BUT IT KIND OF TRUNK ATED SOME OF OUR DATA COLLECTION AND OBSERVATION OPPORTUNITIES. SO WE DON'T HAVE A VERY. THE DATA WE COLLECTED ON DIVISION AND OTHERS WERE ROBUST AND OTHERS WE HAD TO SCRAMBLE AND COLLECT AS MUCH DATA IN THE TIME FRAME WE WERE ABLE TO. I DO HEAR YOU. I KNOW THAT THAT ALL OF OUR BRIDGES AND WATERWAYS PRESENT THIS KIND OF BOTTLENECK AND ESPECIALLY Y IF YOU'RE ON A BICYCLE OR WALKING IT PRESENTS A CHALLENGE AND IT WAS JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS WE WEREN'T ABLE TO MAKE THAT CONNECTION AS PART OF THE PROGRAM HERE.
02:32:21.004: >> OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS? I DON'T THINK I'M SEEING ANY. AM CORRECT THAT WE DON'T HAVE A CONTRACTOR YET?
02:32:37.253: >> CORRECT.
02:32:37.820: >> SO - -
02:32:38.354: >> THURSDAY WE'LL KNOW IF WE HAVE A BIDDER.
02:32:41.491: >> I'M JUST THINKING ABOUT THE LANGUAGE OF THIS MOTION HERE. IT'S GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT OF A FILL IN THE BLANK MOTION BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE CONTRACTOR OR THE FINAL AMOUNTS BEFORE WE WHAT WE HAVE OR IS THERE A WAY WE SHOULD REVISE THIS TO, YOU KNOW, THAT WILL, IT WILL ADJUST WHEN WE NEED IT TO.
02:33:02.879: >> I GUESS THE ONLY ADJUSTMENT THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER IS THAT IF YOU WANTED TO SAY SOMETHING LIKE CONDITIONAL ON RECEIVING A RESPONSIVE BIDDER AND A COST ESTIMATE THAT IS REASONABLE, I MEAN REASONABLE IS NOT GOING TO BE BELL-DEFINED BUT REASONABLE IN COMPARISON TO THE ENGINEERINGEST MT. PROVIDED AND - - ENGINEERING ESTIMATE PROVIDED EXPO LOU STAFF THE ABILITY TO INTERPRET WHAT IS REASONABLE.
02:33:34.677: >> OKAY, I'M GO YING TO CALL IT THE NECESSARY FUNDS RATHER THAN CALL OUT THE EXACT AMOUNTS DOES THAT WILL THAT WORK?
02:33:43.486: >> SURE, YEAH.
02:33:44.354: >> GREAT. SO I AM GOING TO READ THIS MOTION. THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION RECOMMENDS THAT CITY COUNCIL APPROVE THE RESOLUTION TO AWARD THE CONTRACT TO THE APPROPRIATE BIDDER FOR THE 2021 HEALTHY STREETS DEPLOYMENT AND TO APPROPRIATE RATE NECESSARY FUNDS FROM THE MAJOR STREET FUND OPERATIONS AND CITY OF ANN ARBOR MAINTENANCE BUDGETS AND FROM THE MINOR STREET FUND OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE BUDGET. I'M LOOKING FOR SOMEONE TO MOVE THIS. I SEE COMMISSIONER HA - - HAUT, MAKI.
02:34:44.480: >> SO I WILL CALL COMMISSIONERS TO VOTE ON THE MOTION THAT MOLLY HAS JUST THAT COMMISSIONER KLEINMAN HAS DESCRIBED AND PLEASE VOTE YES, NO, OR INDICATE IF YOU ARE ABSTAINING. COMMISSIONER BOLAND YES.
02:35:03.499: >> COUNCIL MEMBER BRIG.
02:35:04.033: >> YES.
02:35:04.300: >> COMMISSIONER PHELPS.
02:35:09.739: >> THAT WAS A YES.
02:35:10.773: >> SORRY, I DON'T HAVE - - DIDN'T SEE. COMMISSIONER HAUTAMAKI.
02:35:18.181: >> YES.
02:35:19.348: >> COMMISSIONER HOLT.
02:35:21.084: >> YES.
02:35:21.584: >> COMMISSIONER KLEINMAN.
02:35:22.685: >> YES, BUT I THINK YOU MISSED ONE...
02:35:27.790: >> SORRY, YES COMMISSIONER LEE.
02:35:31.828: >> YES.
02:35:32.829: >> COMMISSIONER PARSONS.
02:35:35.064: >> YES.
02:35:37.300: >> COMMISSIONER SMITH.
02:35:40.103: >> YES.
02:35:40.870: >> AND IT CARRIES UNANIMOUSLY.
02:35:43.172: >> GREAT. THANK YOU.EN SO NOW I THINK I HAND THE [S BACK OVER TO CHAIR MILLS.
02:35:52.482: >> FOR 8B, YES, THE RECONSIDERATION AMENDMENTS TO MODIFY HOME OCCUPATION REGULATIONS IN SECTION 5.16.6. H HAD OF CHAPTER 55 UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE FOR CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL. MR. LENART MR. LENART WILL GIVE US A BRIEF BACKGROUND AND THEN I'LL READ THE MOTION.  THERE'S NO PUBLIC HEARING.
02:36:13.836: >> CORRECT. PLANNING COMMISSION BASED ON PLANNING COMMISSION FEEDBACK, COMMISSIONER MILLS AND I HAVE PLACED THIS ITEM ON THE AGENDA. THIS WILL BE THE LAST OPPORTUNITY IF THE PLANNING COMMISSION DESIRES TO RECONSIDER THEIR RECOMMENDATION ON PROPOSED MODIFICATIONS TO THE HOME OCCUPATION REGULATIONS. IF PASSED, I WOULD RECOMMEND IF THE MOTION TO RECONSIDER IS PASSED I WOULD THEN RECOMMEND THE SUBSEQUENT MOTION WHICH WOULD POSTPONE RECONSIDERATION AND ACTION ON OR POSTPONE ACTION ON THAT ITEM IN TILL THE MAY 4 MEETING IN BETWEEN NOW AND THEN WE WOULD ALSO BRING THIS BACK TO THE ORDINANCE REVISIONS COMMITTEE FOR A SERIES OF OPTIONS AND ULTIMATELY REVISED ORDINANCE TO PRESENT ON MAY 4.
02:37:09.158: >> ALL RIGHT. SO THE FIRST MOTION THAT WE HAVE TO DISCUSS IS JUST WHETHER OR NOT TO RECONSIDER IT. THAT MOTION IS THE PLANNING COMMISSION SHALL RECONSIDER THE APPROVAL OF AMENDMENTS TO MODIFY HOME OCCUPATION REGULATIONS IN SECTION 5.16.6. H OF CHAPTER 55 UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE ORIGINALLY APPROVED ON APRIL 6, 2021. MOVED BY HAS TO BE SOMEBODY WHO WAS THERE, COMMISSIONER LEE, SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER DISCH. IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION OF THIS MOTION? WE DON'T DO THIS VERY OFTEN SO I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY TAT THIS IS EFFECTIVELY LIKE WE TAKE BACK THE FACT THAT WE PASSED IT. WE DON'T WANT TO SEND IT TO COUNCIL YET. AND THAT IF THERE ARE CHANGES THAT WE WANT TO MAKE TO IT THAT WOULD BE IN THE SECOND, WE CAN DISCUSS THAT AFTER THIS. COMMISSIONER LEE.
02:38:01.344: >> I'LL KEEP IT REALLY BRIEF.  I THINK WE HEARD FROM THE PUBLIC PRETTY LOUD AND, AND WHERE THINK WE NEED TO REVISIT THIS SO I WOULD BE IN FAVOR OF POSTPONING IT, HAVING A GOOD DISCUSSION ABOUT IT.  I'M NOT AFRAID TO SAY I THINK WE NEED TO REVISIT IT AND I THINK WE MADE A MISTAKE IN PASSING IT AND WE WANT TO LISTEN TO THE PUBLIC.  I'M IN FAVOR OF THIS, I HAVE NO PROBLEMS OF IT, SO I'M GOING TO VOTE IN FAVOR.
02:38:29.038: >> ANY OTHER DISCUSSION OF PULLING IT BACK?  FLUSH COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN.
02:38:35.344: >> ALSO HOPING THAT RYAN STANTON OR SOMEBODY FROM THE ANN ARBOR IS CURRENTLY WATCHING THIS SO THEY COULD PUBLICIZE THIS A LITTLE BIT BIT MORE IN CASE THERE WAS ANYTHING ELSE WE DIDN'T THINK ABOUT, ANY OTHER HOME PROFESSIONS THAT MAYBE THOSE PEOPLE CAN COME OUT OR ZOOM INTO OUR NEXT MEETING SO THAT WE CAN GET SOME ADDITIONAL FEEDBACK IF THERE ARE OTHER PROFESSIONS WE MAY HAVE OVERLOOKED OR OTHER BUSINESSES. THANK YOU.
02:39:05.241: >> AGREED AND I JUST POINT OUT THAT WE DID HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL COMMUNICATIONS THAT EXTEND BEYOND METAL WORKING TO RECORDING STUDIOS. I ALSO THINK, WELL, LET'S GET TO THIS IN A SECOND MOTION ABOUT POSTPONEMENT. I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THAT. ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT WE PULL IT BACK?  ANY OTHER DISCUSSION?  OKAY. I THINK WE CAN JUST DO A VOICE VOTE. ALL IN FAVOR OF THE MOTION TO RECONSIDER PLEASE SAY YES OR RAISE YOUR HAND.
02:39:37.573: >> YES.
02:39:38.474: >> GREAT. I THINK THAT'S ALL THE PLANNING COMMISSIONERS.
02:39:42.411: >> IS ANYBODY OPPOSED?  GREAT SO THAT MOTION CARRIES.  LET ME READ THE SECOND MOTION.  THE CITY PLANNING COMMISSION SHALL POSTPONE CONSIDERATION OF AMENDMENTS TO MODIFY HOME OCCUPATION REGULATIONS IN SECTION 5.16.6. H OF CHAPTER 55 UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE TO THE MAY 4, 2021 REGULAR MEETING. MOVED BY COMMISSIONER SAUVE, SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER GIBB RANDALL.  IS THERE DISCUSSION OF THIS?  THE THINGS THAT I THINK WOULD BE HELPFUL TO DISCUSS ARE WHEN WE COME BACK TO THAT, THERE WERE A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF MOTIONS ON THE TABLE BEFORE OR SUGGESTIONS ON THE TABLE. ONE IS JUST MOVING SOME OCCUPATIONS FROM PROHIBITED TO PERMISSIVE BUT I THINK THERE WAS ALSO SOME PUBLIC COMMENT ABOUT WHETHER WE SHOULD GET RID OF DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN PROFESSIONS AT ALL AND INSTEAD FOCUS ON THE OUTCOMES, THE EFFECTS, THE NOISE AND THE TRIP GENERATION AND THAT KIND OF THING.  SO I KNOWING WHAT TO HAVE STAFF PREPARE FOR THAT I THINK WOULD BE HELPFUL TO GET PEOPLES THOUGHTS ABOUT WHERE YOUR MIND IS ABOUT WHICH OF THOSE TWO PATHOSIS OUGHT TO TAKE. COMMISSIONER ABRONS. AND THEN COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN AND THEN - -
02:41:10.766: >> I THINK COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN WAS AHEAD OF ME.
02:41:14.303: >> OKAY, BUT MR. LENART IS PULLING ME BACK BECAUSE MAYBE I'M OFF.
02:41:17.473: >> OKAY.
02:41:17.807: >> MY INTENTION WAS TO PROVIDE BOTH OF THOSE AS OPTIONS TO THE ORC AND THEN THE ORDINANCE REVISION COMMITTEE COULD HELP ADVISE STAFF ON WHICH TO FORWARD TO THE FULL PLANNING COMMISSION. MY INTENTION WAS TO PROVIDE SORTS OF BOTH OPTIONS, ONE MOVING ACTIVITIES ANOTHER OPTION THAT WOULD JUST STRIKE ALL LISTING OF A SPECIFIC USES.
02:41:42.865: >> GOING INTO THE ORC I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO KNOW WHAT THE, BECAUSE THE ORC FOR THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW THE ORDINANCE REVISIONS COMMITTEE, A SUNCOMMIT Y OF PLAN - - ARE. A SUBCOMMITTEE OF PLANNING COMMISSION. COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN WAS FIRST.
02:41:58.013: >> COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN: THANK YOU. I'D LIKE TO, SO, THE ITEM I'D LIKE TO DISCUSS IS TIMING.  IF THE ORC IS GOING TO BE LOOKING A THIS NEXT TUESDAY THEN A WEEK FROM THEN IT WOULD COME TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION.  I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S ENOUGH TIME FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO REVIEW THIS AND FOR US TO GET ENOUGH FEEDBACK JUST BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY ONLY A WEEK.  BASED ON HOW MUCH FEEDBACK WE RECEIVED I THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE ENOUGH PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN IT. SO I'M NOT GOING TO MOVE THIS RIGHT NOW BUT I'D REALLY LIKE TO HAVE SOME CONVERSATION ABOUT POTENTIALLY MOVING THIS INSTEAD OF HAVING DISCUSSION AT THE MAY 4 MEETING EVEN THOUGH WE MAY BE PREPARED TO HAVE THE DISCUSSION TO POTENTIALLY MOVING ITO THE MAY 18 MEETINGUST SO THAT MEMRS OF THE PUBLIC HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO REVIEW THIS, PROVIDE US WITH FEEDBACK SO IT DON'T SEEM AS RUSHED THAT 'RE GOIN WEEK TO WEE TO TRY TO MAKE TS DISION.  I' LE TO GET MY COLLEAGUES' OPINIONS ON THAT.
02:43:13.155: >> ALSO MR. LENART LETTING US KNOW WHAT'S MAY 18. COMMISSIONER ABRONS DO YOU WANT TO CHIME IN?
02:43:17.726: >> I WAS GOING TO EXPRESS SOME THOUGHTS ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO STANDARDS, PUT I THINK IF MR. LENART'S PLANNING TO PRESENT BOTH I'LL JUST HOLE ON TO THAT.
02:43:26.735: >> AND YOU'RE ON ORC.
02:43:28.537: >> YEAH.
02:43:28.971: >> SO YOU'LL GET TO DISCUSS IT NEXT WEEK. COMMISSIONER SAUVE.
02:43:34.510: >> I HAVE ONE MORE COMPARISON THAT MIGHT EXTEND THE TIMELINE IS I THINK THERE WAS ALSO SOME CONFUSION OF HOBBIEST AND OCCUPATION, AND I THINK NEXT WE HOARIER IS THE LIVE-WORK, WHICH ALSO OVERLAPPED I THINK WITH TC1 CORRIDOR AND ZONING AS WELL. EVEN IF STAFF COULD JUST SHARE WHAT LIVE-WORK ZONING LOOKS LIKE COMPARED TO HOME OCCUPATION IF THERE IS A DIFFERENCE AND KIND OF WHAT THOSE KIND OF DEFINITIONS AND PLAN VIEW STANDARDS MOUTH LOOK LIKE I THINK WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR US UNDERSTANDING IF THAT'S A COMPLETELY SEPARATE ZONING DESIGNATION AND WHERE THAT VENN DIAGRAM OF OVERLAP WOULD LOOK LIKE. WITH THAT, IF THERE'S A THIRD TIER OF COMPARISON IN TIME THAT'S WHERE I WOULD AGREE THAT WE START GETTING REALLY PINCHED WITH EVALUATING THE VARIATIONS OF THIS THING.
02:44:31.533: >> TO THE FIRST QUESTION, TO MIAMI COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT COMMISSIONER SAUVE AS I CAUTIONED THE PLANNING COMMISSION BEFORE FRANKLY ZONING'S A TERRIBLE PLACE TO TRY TO DE5 EVERY SCENARIO. AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS YET ON MAYOR 18 THAT DEADLINE HAS NOT PASSED KNOWING THIS IS GOING TO BE PLACED ON THERE I CAN MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE SCHEDULING AROUND IT AND ANY PROJECTS THAT COME AFTER WE CAN, I CAN MAKE SURE THAT AGENDA DOESN'T GET TOO LARGE.
02:45:30.492: >> COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN.
02:45:31.427: >> I'D LIKE TO MAKE THE AMENDMENT MOVING IT TO MAYOR - - TO MAY 18.
02:45:37.266: >> THAT WAS, UM, YES. WHOEVER... MOVED AND SECONDED.
02:45:46.809: >> I'LL SECOND THAT.
02:45:47.810: >> IT WAS SAUVE AND GIBB RANDALL WERE THE MOVER AND SECOND.
02:45:51.146: >> AND THEY'RE COOL WITH IT SO THAT'S ACTUALLY THE MOTION WE DON'T EVEN NEED TO MAKE AN ACTUAL AMENDMENT OR VOTE ON THE AMENDMENT, THAT'S WHAT THE MOTION READS NOW. ANY OTHER DISCUSSION OF THAT? THE PLAN OF ATTACK FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE LISTENING THEN WOULD BE THAT WE DISCUSS THIS AT ORC WHICH IS IN ONE WEEK'S TIME ON TUESDAY AT SEVEN O'CLOCK. AND THEN THERE WOULD BE A THREE-WEEK GAP, AND IT WOULD COME BACK FOR A VOTE BEFORE THE FULL PLANNING COMMISSION ON MAY 18. ALL RIGHT. ALL THOSE IN FAVOR OF THE MOTION TO POSTPONE PLEA SAY YES OR RAISE YOUR HAND. ANY OPPOSED? ALL RIGHT, THEN THE MOTION CARRIES UNANIMOUSLY. ITEM 8C IS GIVING SOME WORK PLAN OVERVIEWS BECAUSE I THINK THAT THERE ARE ACTUALLY QUITE A FEW PLACES WHERE OUR WORK PLANS OVERLAP AND SO STAFF WAS GOING TO SHARE JUST A COUPLE OF HIGHLIGHTS FROM PLANNING COMMISSION AND TRANSPORTATION COMMISSIONS WORK PLANS.
02:47:09.458: >> SURE, I'LL START.  I'VE GOT A BRIEF 45-MINUTE PRESENTATION. SO, UM, NO. SO THE PLANNING COMMISSION WORK PLAN IS GENERALLY BROKEN UP INTO A COUPLE OF CATEGORIES, THE MASTER PLAN WORK, THE ORDINANCE WORK, AND THEN DIFFERENT CATEGORIES OF WISH LISTS. FROM A MASTER PLAN SIDE, ON A REGULAR BASIS, THE PLANNING COMMISSION IS THE BODY THAT TAKES FINAL ACTION ON THE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS PLAN. THAT OF COURSE HAS A LOT OF THERE CITY'S PRIORITIES FOR TRANSPORTATION CAPITAL INVESTMENTS AND A WIDE VARIETY OF CAPITAL INVESTMENTS ACROSS THE CITY. THE MASTER PLAN LAST NIGHT THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR DID RECOMMEND AS PART OF HIS BUDGET PRESENTATION FUNDING FOR THE CITY TO UNDERTAKE A COMPREHENSIVE MASTER PLAN UPDATE IN 2022 SO STARTING IN 2022. THAT'S GREAT.
02:48:21.897: >> ALSO SOME SER SUPPORT FOR CONDUCTING A COMMUNITY CONVERSATION ABOUT OUR SINGLE FAMILY ZONING DISTRICTS AND THE HISTORY OF RACE AND SINGLE FAMILY ZONING. AND THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR CHANGING HOW WE THINK ABOUT SINGLE FAMILY ZONING IN OUR COMMUNITY. THAT COMMUNITY, THAT CONVERSATION IS STARTING TO HAPPEN IN OUR COMMUNITY, AND I THINK IT'S TIME THAT THE CITY PLANNING FROM A PLANNING PERSPECTIVE INSPECT START ENGAGING IN THAT LONG BEFORE WE MOVE TO POLICY PRIORITIZATION ALONG ANY OF THOSE LINES. THEN ON THE ORDINANCE SIDE WE HAVE THIS EXPLAINS WHY THE PLANNING COMMISSION ALWAYS LOOKS WEARY. THEY HAVE RECENTLY COMPLETED UPDATE TO THE SIGN ORDINANCE, ELECTRICAL VEHICLE PARKING, EXEMPTIONS TO HEIGHT LIMITS WHEN YOU'RE ADDING ROOFS, EXEMPTIONS TO SITE REQUIREMENTS WHEN @NING ACCESSORY STRUCTURES, SOME MINOR CLEANUP AMENDMENTS TO OUR CODE, A NEW FLOOD PLAIN OVERLAY DISTRICT, AND THEN IN PROCESS IS CHANGES TO OUR OUTDOOR LUTING REQUIREMENTS. THE - - OUTDOOR LIGHTING REQUIREMENTS, MODIFICATIONS TO THE PLANNED PROJECT REQUIREMENTS WHICH PROVIDES FLEXIBILITY FOR DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS, CHANGES TO SITE PLAN REVIEW THRESHOLDS THAT MIGHT MAKE SMALL MODEST PROJECTS EASIER 3 #. EVERY PLANNING COMMISSION AGENDA ENDS WITH COMMISSIONER PROPOSED BUSINESS AND HERE'S SOME OF THE MORE TRANSPORTATION FOCUSED IDEAS THAT HAVE COME OUT OF THE COMMISSION OVER THE LAST YEAR OR SO.  CERTAINLY, I SHOULD SAY ON THE HORIZON POTENTIALLY REMOVING PARKING MINIMUMS AND OTHER WAYS SUCH AS TANDEM PARKING PROVISIONS.  FLUSH -RPB MAKING SURE WHEN DEVELOPMENT HAPPENS PUBLIC SIDEWAY - - SIDEWALKS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ROAD. A COMMON, A RELATIVELY RECENT EXPERIENCE IS RIDE SHARE DELIVERY ACCOMMODATION ON SITE. TENDS TO BE A MORE ACUTE CONCERN IN DOWNTOWN DISTRICTS WHERE LAND IS MORE TIME. HOW WE WANT TO THINK ABOUT ACCOMMODATING THAT AS PART OF OUR TRANSPORTATION RIDE SHARE PLAN JUST ACCOMMODATED. LOOKING AT BICYCLE PARKING REQUIREMENTS.  I THINK GENERALLY THERE IS WHETHER OR NAT WE SHOULD PERHAPS SIMPLIFY OR CHANGE THE PRIORITY OF THE TYPES OF BIKE PARKING WE REQUIRE VERSUS INTERIOR VERSUS COVERED, VERSUS - - PEDESTRIAN CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN AND AMONG PRIVATE DEVELOPMENTS WHEN WE DON'T NECESSARILY CONTROL THAT ADJACENT LAND, AND DRIVE-THRUS AND WHETHER OR NOT OUR COMMUNITY SHOULD ALLOW THEM AT ALL.
02:52:01.249: >> IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT YOU ALL WANT TO, LIKE, CHIME IN ON, AND GIVE US A DRAFT TO RESPOND TO, WE CAN GET MORE DONE AHEAD OF, LIKE, I MEAN HONESTLY THAT'S HOW THE EB PARKING A HAPPENED. SO I THINK, YOU KNOW, YEAH. KAYLA, CAN YOU GIVE MS. COLEMAN CAN YOU GIVE AN OVERVIEW OF THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION'S WORK PLAN?
02:52:26.708: >> YES.  AND I'M GOING TO MAKE IT VERY SHORT AND SWEET. SO YOU SAW IN THE AGENDA PACKET THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION WORK PLAN FOR THIS YEAR AND WE ALWAYS KEEP OURS CALL IT A DRAFT WORK PLAN BECAUSE IT CONTINUES TO EVOLVE THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. WE DO TARGET OUR TOPICS FOR PARTICULAR MONTHS AND FLUSH IT OUT IN DETAIL BUT IT'S ALWAYS A MOVING TARGET THAT'S SUBJECT TO CHANGE.  AS YOU CAN SEE IN THAT WORK PLAN THERE ARE SOME ITEMS THAT WE REVISIT ON A ROUTINE BASIS, SOME ANNUAL TOPIC AND ONE THAT IS THE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS PLAN AND THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION HAS BEEN MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE CIP OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS AND I THINK THAT THAT'S THEN A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR SOME COLLABORATION ALTHOUGH WE HAVEN'T COME TOGETHER IN A MEETING LIKE THIS BEFORE WE HAVE BEEN EXCHANGING MATERIALS IN A WAY THAT'S BEEN COLLABORATIVE. WE'VE ALSO RECEIVED PRESENTATIONS ABOUT THE TRANSIT ORIENTED ZONING, AND ALEXIS HAS ATTENDED MULTIPLE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION MEETINGS TO PRESENT THAT EFFORT AND COMMISSIONERS HAVE PROVIDED AND PUT IN THAT PROCESS. PARKING IS MENTIONED.  PARKING HAS ALSO BEEN A TOPIC OF DISCUSSION WITH A TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION AND THERE'S BEEN AN INTEREST IN WHAT THE DDA IS LOOKING AT WITH CURB SPACE MANAGEMENT DOWNTOWN IN PARTICULAR LOCATIONS FOR PARKING.  THAT'S A TOPIC THAT WE'VE NOT DELVED INTO DEEPLY AT THIS POINT, BUT HAS BEEN NOTED AS A POTENTIAL TOPIC. WE ALSO HAVE TO RECEIVE PRESENTATION OF THE FISCAL YEAR'S BUDGET ANY OVERVIEW OF THE BUDGET AS A WHOLE, BUT PRIMARILY THE TRANSPORTATION ELEMENTS AND COMMISSION TYPICALLY OR HAS HISTORICALLY MADE A RECOMMENDATION TO CITY COUNCIL RELATED TO THOSE TRANSPORTATION COMPONENTS OF THE BUDGET. WE ALSO RECEIVED AN ANNUAL PRESENTATION ABOUT STREET RESURFACING PROJECTS SO THE CITY'S ENGINEERING DEPARTMENTS HAS AN ANNUAL STREET RESURFACING PLAN AND THAT'S ONE OF THE PRIMARY WAYS THAT I THINK THAT THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION HAS INFLUENCED CHANGES TOHE STRE SCAPES THRGHOUT T CI THAT HAVBEEN ILEMEED, QUESTIS T RAISED, AND LL-UP IS DE. I IS TRU SEEN T IMPACTVEN IN JUST THIS YEAR'S PRESENTATION. SO A FEW ROADS IN PARTICULAR SUCH AS SOUTH INDUSTRIAL, SOME FEEDBACK RESULTED IN CHANGES TO THOSE PLANS. OTHER HIGHLIGHTS I MIGHT MENTION.  ANOTHER WORK AREA THAT THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION HAS BEEN WORKING ON IS MAYBE CLOSE TO WRAPPING UP IS CHANGE CHANGES TO THE CREATING I GUESS AN ORDINANCE CALLED A MICRO MOBILITY ORDINANCE OR PERSONAL MOBILITY VEHICLE MAYBE MAY BE THE EXACT TERM. IT WILL PROVIDE POLICY GUIDANCE FOR THE APPROPRIATE OPERATIONS AND SPACE FOR THINGS LIKE PERSONAL MOBILITY VEHICLES SUCH AS E-SCOOTERS AND THAT'S BEEN AN EFFORT THAT THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION HAS STUCK THROUGH WORKING ON THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS AND WE'RE GETTING VERY, VERY CLOSE TO BRINGING THAT TO FINAL ACTION. THAT DOESN'T BY ANY MEANS ENCOMPASS ALL OF THE WORK OF THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION. WOO OFTEN GET VARIOUS THINGS REFERRED FROM CITY COUNCIL, PARTICULARLY TOPICS THAT HAVE A TRANSPORTATION EMPHASIS OR FOCUS WHERE THE TRANSPORTATION IS ASKED TO WEIGH IN. THE RANGE OF TOPICS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TO THE COMMISSION. BUT IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT AS THE QUICK OVERVIEW IF RAYMOND OR OTHERS WANT TO CHIME IN ON THINGS I MISSED WE SHOULD NOTE IN THIS MEETING PLEASE DO. BUT I THINK THERE ARE DEFINITELY OPPORTUNITIES OF INTERSECTION BETWEEN PLANNING AND TRANSPORTATION, AND I THING THIS WAS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO SEE HOW WE CAN BE WORKING TOGETHER AND LOOK FORWARD TO FUTURE TONIGHTS FOR THAT AS WELL.
02:57:07.922: >> THANK THANK YOU.  VERY GOOD. ALL RIGHT. LET'S MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER 9, PUBLIC COMMENT. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY, THE FINAL OPPORTUNITY FOR PERSONS TO SPEAK FOR UP TO THREE MINUTES ABOUT ANY ITEM OF INTEREST. PUBLIC COMMENT CAN BE MADE BY CALLING 7 EVER 7-8 - - 87 SAFE PROGRAM-853-5247 AND BY ENTERING MEETING ID 99098968122. YOU PRESS STAR 9 ON YOUR PHONE AND SINCE I SEE SOME FOLKS THAT HAVE ALREADY RAISED THEIR HAND, WE CAN PROMOTE ONE OF THEM IN TURN.
02:57:46.327: >> CALLER WITH PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 760, GO AHEAD YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE COMMISSIONS.
02:57:51.599: >> HI, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
02:57:54.869: >> WE CAN.
02:57:55.970: >> GOOD EVENING, FRANCIS MILLS AT 5 PARK VIEW PLACE ANN ARBOR, MICHIGAN.  I WASN'T - - ITEM 6, I HOPE - - OPPORTUNITY FOR MALEK COMMENT TONIGHT DURING 8B - - PLANNING COMMISSIONS RECONSIDERATION ABOUT ORDINANCE HOWEVER SINCE THERE WASN'T I'D LIKE TO USE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO JUST LET THE RECORD REFLECT AND THIS WAS ALSO AT THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION AND COUNCIL MEMBER BRIGS KNOW AND ALSO PUBLIC HEAR HEARING UNPRECEDENTED 20 CALLERS THAT SPOKE DURING LAST WEEK'S SPECIAL MEETING PLANNING COMMISSION. SPECIFICALLY ASKING FOR STRIKING ITEM 4H - - PROHIBITED OCCUPATIONS. I DON'T BELIEVE THE CITY'S POSTED A RECORDING OF THOSE COMMENTS YET, WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO FIND, SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THOSE STORIES BE ACKNOWLEDGED AND AFFIRMED.  ARE. SECOND, MAYBE THERE'S A QUESTION FOR MR. LENART, CURIOUS TO KNOW WILL THE ORC BE ENTERTAINING PUBLIC COMMENT, AND AND THIRD I GUESS IS THAT RUDIMENTARY UNDERSTANDING OF ZONING LAW IN MICHIGAN IS THAT ACTIVITY SHOULD BE NUMERATED SPECIFICALLY FOR IT TO BE ALLOWED. THEREFORE I'D LIKE TO SUGGEST THE STAFF ALSO CONSIDER PREPARING LANGUAGE FOR ORC POSSIBILITY OF ADDING HOME MACHINE SHOPS AS AN EXPLICITLY ALLOWED ACTIVITY. OTHERWISE JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR HAVING THE COURAGE TO RECONSIDER THE HOME OCCUPATIONS ORDINANCE.  WE APPRECIATE ALL THAT YOU DO TO VOLUNTEER FOR OUR CITY, AND THANK YOU FOR HELPING MAKE SURE THAT ANN ARBOR TREATS METAL WORKERS LIKE IT TREATS WOOD WORKERS.  THANK YOU.
02:59:38.039: >> THANK YOU.
02:59:44.846: >> MR. LENART:  CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 955. GO AHEAD.
02:59:52.287: >> HI, KIRK WESTFALL AGAIN, STILL AT 3505 CHARTER PLACE. THANKS FOR A GREAT MEETING. I REALLY APPRECIATED THE MODIFICATION THAT IN MY VIEW WOULD UNTIE THE CITY'S HANDS WHEN IT COMES TO EVALUATING IMPLEMENTING LANE REDUCTIONS. IN MY PREVIOUS COMMENT I SORT OF FORGOT THE PUNCHLINE TO THE WHOLE ROAD DIET CONVERSATION AND THAT'S THERE'S BEEN A I THINK A FEDERAL HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION TO ESTIMATE THAT 19 TO 47 PERCENT REDUCTION IN OVERALL CRASHES, WHETHER IT'S VEHICLE ON VEHICLE, OR VEHICLE ON PEDESTRIAN, WHEN THERE'S A ROAD DIET IMPLEMENT. THIS IS A VERY IMPLEMENTABLE AND URGENTLY NEEDED TECHNIQUE THAT I THINK WE SHOULD BE PUSHING A LOT MORE AGGRESSIVELY ON. I'M REALLY PLEASED TO SEE THE HEALTHY STREETS IMPLEMENTATION ON SOUTH MAIN THAT WILL BE A TEMPORARY ROAD DIET. I WAS QUESTIONING WHY PACKARD WOULDN'T ALSO GET THAT TREATMENT SINCE THEIR TRAFFIC VOLUME AT LEAST FOR PART OF THAT SEGMENT IS SLIGHTLY LESS THAN SOUTH MAIN. THIS IS SUCH A THREAT TO CROSSING PEDESTRIANS WHEN THEY GO ACROSS FORTIFIED LANE ROAD THAT I THINK IT SHOULD BE LOOKED AT VERY AGGRESSIVELY AND ERR ON THE SIDE OF CAUSING A LITTLE BIT OF VEHICLE CONGESTION. MY OTHER POINT HAS TO DO WITH ROUNDABOUTS. THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION HAS SAID THAT MOST INTERSECTIONS SHOULD BE EVALUATED FOR ROUNDABOUTS. I WISH THIS WERE JUST THE DEFAULT CONDITION BY WHICH WE RECONSTRUCT GROWTH IN CORRIDORS IS THAT UNLESS OTHERWISE INDICATED THERE SHOULD BE A ROUNDABOUT INTERSECTIONS WHETHER IT'S SIGNALED BEFORE OR STOP SIGNS. I THINK THE HIGHWAY INSURANCE INSTITUTE SAID THERE'S ABOUT A 70% OF REDUCTION IN INJURY CRASHES.
03:02:13.127: >> I THINK THIS SHOULD BE A REALLY URGENT PRIORITY, AND I THINK IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE PERMANENTLY FEATURED IN THE PLAN. HOWEVER, YOU KNOW, YOUR HANDS AREN'T TIED WITH REGARD TO HOW AGGRESSIVELY YOU
