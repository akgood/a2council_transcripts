00:00:38.522: >> Tonight our retirement system and s the first one up on the agendas and we have Wendy the executive director here to introduce the greater te team.
00:00:52.303: >> Good evening, everyone, thanks, Tom.  My name is Wendy and we have the system's actuaries.  We have GRS and from that team is Jim Anderson and Rich and they'll kick it off with background on the actuarial process and dive into specifics about the system.
00:01:17.461: >> I think that is my queue. I'm sharing my screen.  I'll go fist, I'm Jim.  With me is Rich as Wendy said.  With both the VEBA and retirement system. Our comments will be brief tonight but we welcome questions as we go along.  I'm really not great at looking at my presentation and seeing faces or questions, so if there are any questions, please, shout them out.  And we'll go from there.  So just from a real high level, 30,000 feet at least, I want to talk about retirement plan finances.  This is true for whether it's a retirement system or a VEBA. As your actuaries, the plan provision, and benefits that are provided.  The actuarial assumptions and financial information and Rich will have a page on each of these.  At least on assumptions and you'll see the information at the end. All of it which informs our actuarial evaluation so we have what is digestible for both the board and the city in making decisions and some of the digestible outputs from those inputs are the level of emp employer contributions and how our plan is work and making progress towards our goals. When you talk to mathematicians you need to talk in terms of equations with letters and not numbers.  So here's our letters, contributions plus investment income must equal benefits paid plus expenses. In this equation they're all the same fund and height.  The key is that level of benefits. We'll talk a little bit about what Ann Arbor's done in the past with respect to benefits for these plans.  But we have to fund benefits payable to people in the future.  And we're going to do that through a combination of contribution C and investment income I.  And as a rule of thumb, I've had a lot of systems say, well, we expect to generate fully two-thirds to three-fourths of the amount of money to pay for the benefits through that I, through investment income. That's why in the benefit plan we hope to have money in the fund and the benefits depending on those planned provisions, Rich will go over those in a little bit but also the experience to the people. That's where our assumptions come out where we project out people, how far they're going to live, et cetera, that in turn is what our contributions depend on.  In the short run we can look at assumptions and cost and say, well, we assume 6.9% interest.  It's a different amount if it's 7.9% interest.  What is next is the long-term impact.  The next is I or investor term and I can't see the rest of my notes -- okay, and the benefits actually paid in the long run the actual benefits will be paid to actual benefits and that will determine how we finance with the investment income and the expenses.  I think that's all I have to say on that slide let me go forward another and Rich will take over some of the details on the people right here.
00:04:42.132: >> Absolutely, so, yeah, the next several slides, I will walk us through a high level overview of kind of the inputs into the evaluation model and the last model will give the digestible items that Jim eluded to and thinks of that nature.  Slide four, one of the big pieces of the puzzle is the plan members and who we're putting into the evaluation model.  Most is self-explanatory however on the left-hand side we have the active population.  The big story here is you can see we've got the general group and then this general hybrid group and see those two groups combined make up the vast majority of the active population so we've got a big chunk of liability there with those folks and one of the ways that planned sponsors can derisk their plan a little bit and lower their costs is implementing what the city of Ann Arbor system did and that is the hybrid plan where the folks have lower benefits and they get half defined benefit, half defined contribution benefit and ultimately, what we're going to see overtime is a shift in the general active population from the general group and I'll refer to that I guess as the legacy plan for these folks that only have a defined benefit and as those people leave active status for retirement or other reasons, they're going to be replaced with these general hybrid folks and just for comparison's sake, as of the June 30, 2019 valuation.  The top line item there, the number of general folks was 382.  That's down to 357 this year and not surprisingly we have an uptick up to 165.  We'll continue to expect to see that transition of folks coming into the hybrid plan which again will continue to lower costs for the system. The total active population as of June 30, is 725 folks with a total payroll of here.  We expect that active number of members to remain.  On the right-hand side we have -- on the upper right corner we have current retirees and beneficiaries.  Folks who are currently in receipt of retirement benefits of the city and that's just over 1100 people with total annual benefits of just over 39 million dollars and on the right corner we have a summary of member who is have term Nated active status but eligible to come back in the future For future deferred vested benefit we have just over a hundred people there with allowances of 1.5 million and, again, those are the plan members in the retirement system.  On slide five, we kind of give an overview of both the retirement system.  So -- and the retired health care plan so the top section here you can see, and I've already eluded to this a little bit.  We got the defined benefit element.  Which is exactly that.  That's why it's called the defined benefit plan is it's based on a benefit formula.  Typically a percentage, times average pay. The city of Ann Arbor retirement system has this hybrid portion of their plan for these new general hires. They get a reduced defined benefit but also get a defined contribution benefit as well. And it is important to note that the city of Ann Arbor employee retirement system is a contributor plan meaning that it helps to offset the employer portion of the cost to administer the plan and to fund the plan I should say.  The bottom part of this slide, if you look, we got the city of Ann Arbor health and retirement trust.  This plan you can see is essentially -- we've got a number of folks who were hired before certain dates and they are eligible for city paid health care.  Upon retirement and their health care coverage in retirement will be based on the coverage they had wn retired. For folks hired after certain city heah but do get a ble for annual contribution of 2500 or 3500 dolla per year pending on what groups they're in and the city funds that upon tirement and they can use thoseunds to pay for health care.  And it is a lif insurance death benefit for any folks who aren recpt of a city penon in themount of $10,000. Slide six there is as Jim eludedo actua assutions that ce into play return investment is a big sumption.  T board of trusteesid approve a change the assumed rate returnn discountate i the valuion. om 7% down to 6.5% or a intentiois t rede that rate by 0.1% each year benning with the June 30, 20 valuaons of both the that is the policy thas currently in place.  The board wi --oes pn to assume this rate of return each yea to determi if the additnal difications to the picy are the discot rat for whaver reason.  B it is important to note that a 9% diount rate s ud to cpute lbilities and futureontributions in the syem  Sli sen givnf on accountin standas.  And so therereind of t pieces ofhe puzzl the.  Number e,he big pie ofhe zzle is thathese funde tios thayoreeeing are based on mkevaluef sets Ando that ione of e b things Anoth thing to kinof keepn the back of our minds as we look at these numbers is when we're calculating these funded ratios, liabilities are based on a roll forward methodology. So liabilities for purposes of this funded ratio are as of June 30, 2020 but really they're 2019 liabilities rolled forward a year.  So we'll see on the pension side just going back to 2015 we're up at 88%. Down to 86.  We remain level and now 83.7%.  That volatility in the up and down in those funding ratios has a lot to do with the market assets.  As assets go, funded ratio's impacted immediately in these accounting value weighs.  On the health care side we got a different story. We started at 48% back in 2015. We have this constant increase until 2019 where we take a little bit dip and now back up to 66.8% as of June 30, 2020 might be a little couldn't intuitive when you compare the fund trend versus the pension. But there's a couple factors coming in there.  One is the accelerated funding policy. When you contribute extra funds in the plan.  And the other piece of the puzzle on the health care side is the valuation of the health care plan recognized a change in assumptions that actually served to drive liabilities down which is why you're seeing an increase from funded ratio from 64% up to 66.8% and the last slide I'll tackle here, slide eight really kind of gets to what's the story behind -- what happened in these June 30, 2020 valuations of both the employee's retirement system and the VEBA.  And so I'll start with the left hand column here.  The employee's retirement system you can see we had total actuarial assets of 25.4 million.  That's up from last year.  Last year was 513.6.  Our liabilities are 614 million.  That's up from about 601 last year and so the reality is our liabilities went up, our assets went up, but the real story is our liabilities went up by more than our assets.  So not surprisingly we have an increase in unfunded amount which is just the difference between our liability and our assets and so our unfunded accrued liability is 93.6 million.  That translate to a fiscal year estimated distribution of 16.1 million.  Important to note that the funded ratio did remain pretty level from the prior year unlike on the previous slide, you know, we had a lot more fluctuation and that's due to the main idea, the first line of these asset where is we smooth market returns over a period of future years so we have a lot less volatility of asset values which creates less volatility in our funded ratio as well. In that last item there, I know one of the objectives of the retirement system and s to get to fully funded status. And you'll see based on our projections if all assumptions are met exactly which we all know is not going -- not going to happen, but if they were based on projections, we're expect 100% funded status in the year 2041 on the pension side.  On the health care side we have a similar story in the sense that our actuarial value of assets went up.  We're up 198.9 million.  Our accrued liability went up.  And same story on the VEBA side, liabilities went up by more than the assets and so we do have an increase in our unfunded liability from the prior year up 107.3 million and that translate to a fiscal year estimated contribution of just over 13 million dollars.  If you were to compare this estimated contribution against the fiscal year 21 contribution, even though we're unfunded liabilities went up the estimated contribution actually went down and the reason for that is the temporary suspension of the accelerated policy.  In the prior valuation, we took the prior year budget contribution, increased by 2%.  That contribution was greater and so we ultimately that was the estimated contribution.  But, again, given all the current circumstances, our understanding is that that funding policy, the accelerated funding policy was temporarily suspended and does result in a decreased contribution.  Our funded ratio went from 66.6% down to 65%.  And, again, because of that, as the temporary suspension in the funding policy.  We're expected to reach fully funding on the VEBA side in 2036 as opposed to 2028 valuation and with that, if there are no questions currently I'll go ahead and pass the baton back to Jim to take us a home here.
00:16:09.018: >> Thanks, Rich I'm reminded why I never tell jokes because I think an important part of the punchline I should have said at the start.  For those of us new to the concept we do this valuation once a year. June 30 each year.  These are results for anybody who is watching the investment market since June 30 was the continuing of a real bump up in markets through the rest of 2020.  I think November was the largest increase I heard in small caps ever for a month. The good news is we can hold onto those and if they hold on from November and I imagine they did.  That should be helpful for next year's valuations.  But a couple last slides with some survey information.  Where do we land? We're about mid-80s in terms of funded ratio for the retirement system.  Here we compare our clients, Michigan city and county plans and the mid-80s, level of funding we just talked about.  Puts us right at the middle of this bell-shaped curved.  The 22 number of groups in that 80% category. You can see way to the left if you can read the small text we have a couple groups below 50% in the state and that's a real big issue because if you are that poorly funded we do a note in our report saying that it is crucial that this plan, that is fully funded, less than 50% receives contributions at least equal to what we got our report.  So it's kind of underlining what Ann Arbor already does when there are finances available.  We're suggesting those really poorly unplanned.  On the flip side way to the right you see there's 21 different groups that are above 100%.  100% or higher.  We have a wide range. The other thing that would impact this.  I will go to the next slide, what are the underlying assumptions.  You can be 100% funded with an 80% return.  That's different using 6.9 so the investment return here for the same Michigan city and county plans that we have, here is an interesting story. Ann Arbor is right again in the number of groups 22 in the very middle, between 6.75%, 6.99%, and my comment on this chart is I'm kind of still amazed there's a few plans at 7.5. Any plan I had is down by 7% at this point but generally we're expecting add these bars to move left. And there are more plans at 7 and below and, again, Ann Arbor's leading the way as we make our way down to 6.5% in the next five year plan as Rich commented.  That important assumption.  That's why we break this out separately. Moving to VEBA.  We don't have a database like our VEBA clients.  This is the funding level status for the Michigan plans in 2019.  You can see the footnote talks a little bit about this data but important to note, Ann Arbor's in the mid-60s range, so point is my finger you can't see that there's the three small bar to the right.  The third one to the right is where Ann Arbor resides.  You can see there are some plans of over 100%.  The bigger story here is that you're still ahead of most local units in funding your VEBA obligations by being in the mid-60s range.  The average is on the order of 35%.  And the median is 20% and you might remember the difference between median and average.  Well, the median is half the number of folks are above that and half are below.  When you have 69 plans that are at 0. Absolutely 0 assets included. That's why we get this strange result.  Nearly a quarter of the plans have no assets set aside for funding.  So Ann Arbor is in good shape relative to the rest of our state.  I just covered all these comments so we'll go to risk management. My final slide before Wendy takes over with some investment stuff.  I want to talk about risk management a bit.  There are certainlyome very prudent actices in place for the board as part of their governance.  It's an impornt to have this study everyive years.  T assumptions a very important because we're trying to predict the fure d we want to be like Goldilocks we don't wanto be too coervative.  Wwant to be just right.  To estite what we pay andor how ng. That's wt wre tryin to fund for tt.  For retirement nefits.  As part of governance the board reews the funding polyontribution are forcedo do this y have inour pocy.  Though it is suspded this ye.  It's eater than what we calculat and at is a great thingo ep getting the fd and the atus plan on the up and up. It alsprovides contrution stability as we go along a point from the brd governor's andpoint is a decning am Morty eization.  We hadhis approv SLIEBLT liabily. Th 93 milon doars. ere's a plafor payin that f.  Similly like a he mogage.  So using the retirement system.  93 mlion bucks, h are we haning that.  We amortizing th. to the artization piod get 'll pay tt offnd that wille scussed  t nt experiencetudy as wgo amortition that Ann Arbor usess vy unique. or an openla that aot of have stuff is bed paol  The toward a principle balance. We're not just making interest. We're making actual principle payments towards our unfunded liabilities calculating each year which is really a great thing and another strength of -- in terms of the board governance and how we fund the plans.  As far as actions to -- taken to reduce or address our liability in growth.  Liability in growth and risks thereof. Kind of tip my hat but as Rich said there's a new benefit tier for certain post-26 centers for retirement system and it's a different way of building benefits.  Benefits can have the benefit but to define the contribution plan as well.  So there's less defined benefit dollars for those new hires that come in in future years. Similarly the VEBA had that new tier that Rich talked about as well and these will both lead to contribution reduction, ultimately as we get all those new hires in and stability with regard to that.  Relative to our staff.  So Rich and I zoomed through our presentation.  We welcome any questions you might have or pass it down to Wendy and you can take questions after that as well.
00:24:04.193: >> Well, thank you very much to you both, I'm sorry, did Tom, did you have a comment?
00:24:09.532: >> Could I a make a comment before you wrap up.
00:24:12.168: >> I had a couple slides about the investments and then we're wrapping up.
00:24:19.809: >> Go ahead 1  -- the system really faired very well especially in comparison with other retirement systems. There's always been this risk mitigating strategy as part of the retirement system assets that our consultant always said you never want to see this plan do well.  He says it much more colorfully but says if this fund does well, then things are really heading south and he was absolutely right.  We were able to -- the returns I think were almost 40% one quarter.  Not that there were a large amount of assets in that plan but we were able to take some cash out that have and put it towards benefits.  There was a rebalancing plan already in place prior to this year and the board absolutely decided to take advantage of that.  They moved over about a month.  Only 20 million total in assets. Over the entire year it resulted in 8 million dollars in benefits.  That's something the system favors as well and as Jim and Rich mentioned the discount rate was reduced this year by ten basis points and will continue to be going forward.  Jim, could you go to the next one?  These are general comments we probably shared last year as well.  Just the retirement system and VEBA have a very diversified portfolio.  All over the board we do everything from indexing to private equity funds, infrastructure, and our fees, are very low comparable to many other public retirement systems.  So I know this was an insane amount of information. A lot of numbers.  So we certainly welcome any questions right now but if you need time to digest this and circle back with questions we obviously will be glad to answer any of those after the meeting.  Tom, did you have a question you wanted to highlight?
00:26:28.904: >> Yeah, mayor, if you don't mind --
00:26:31.807: >> Please.
00:26:32.875: >> Could you go back to slide seven for a second?  Council, having spent some time on the retirement board for some years.  I will just say you've got an excellent group of residents and employees who serve on that board.  And have really done a good job with the way they administer the system. So compared to their benchmarks I think they do really well. The challenge of the system and I -- I want them to look back at the slide because -- I want to give you a little bit longer term picture than five years. On the graph on the bottom left which is the pension system, if you go back to fifteen years -- twenty years we were 120% funded.  And anytime you're over 100% funded your contributions are lower.  And when you're under 100% funded your contributions are higher so that 100% is really where you're paying your benefits and oddly enough we were drifting downward until 2009 when the great recession started and in 2009 we were 100% funded.  So what you've seen since 2009 is really the impact of all the variables, really, that occurred.  But I want to draw your attention to that because we went down to the 70s in our total funding after the great recession and come back up to around this mid to upper 80s but as you can see even with our funding policy which is a strong policy, we have been unable to really breakthrough and get back to our 100% and I say that because a you get back to 100% you'll see the level of contributions that you need to make really drop off.  And I say that because the difference here is really, like debt, and we need to pay that debt down and so when I look at this graph, I see that our -- we're staying constant on our debt but not making the progress that we need to.  That's a little bit different on a health care side and I'm giving you my perspective.  On the health care side you can see 48-64.  Doesn't look like a whole lot on this graph.  That is meaningful.  That's some real millions of dollars and a real testament to funding that you guys have continued to approve into the plan.  It's historically been easier to get this one closer to 100%. Because the plan is almost closed.  Meaning that the liability doesn't change as much as it will on the pension side and so as you look at this, we've had this little kind of levelling off but if we get back to the funding policy that you have, you'll continue to see the health care trust fund go ahead and lime  climb to 100%. That's very achievable.  The biggest change we'll see is the rate of return.  But we will see -- and I say that because the nature of that asset is a little bit different than -- or that liability's a little bit different than the pension system.  I want to give that little bit of longer term.  On the retired health care side, more accurately, in 2009, there -- I forgot the amount we had but we might have been 10% funded or something.  It was very minimal.  I really don't recall the percentage but it was much, much lower, you really see the progress in funding over the years on the retired health care.  Thanks.
00:30:33.248: >> Someone asked why don't we see in that increase on the pension side?  The increased in funding status like in health care in addition to the things that Tom mentioned right now we have about 39 million dollars a year being paid out in benefits from the pension system, so we don't have those kind of outflows right now on the health care side so I just wanted to add that.
00:30:58.273: >> Councilmember Hayner.
00:30:59.708: >> Sure.  A couple things, a quick comment.  I think I see an attendee waiting to be let in.  If you can let them in I will appreciate it.  So when you speak to the health care plan you say -- the plan is nearing closure, it's about to be closed.  Can you tell us what you mean by that?  I always wondered what would happen to this plan if we finally got a nationalized single payer health care system.  We're guaranteed private health care in this case or -- what would happen if we did go to -- you know, if we did have -- finally have a public health care system in this nation?
00:31:43.419: >> I don't know if you want to fill that, Jim, thank you for the question.  I know when we say closed of course the new hires coming to the plan are not getting the fully paid health care coverage.  It's that annual stipend.  I don't know if you have any thoughts on that?
00:32:00.369: >> Yeah, I think back to this, and this was for the retirement system but what I think is going to happen is just using the general as an example, so in the retirement system you had a certain date going to what's called a high bring. Ed it's what Rich described so there's two things. Number one, we have a closed plan, that means there's an existing number and I don't know, Rich, if you can find that as your listening.  Let's use this as an example.  These 357 people would continue to have that old type of benefit if you will, whereas the new people get the stipend as we talked about.  The closed plan, these people, it will be that change of people getting the old type of health care if you will versus the stipend.  That will diminish for years going forward.  We have a general rule ofhumb.  Usually, how leave the workforce within ten years y'll have like50% of that new hires getting that f lowe benefit.
00:33:11.473: >> And, Jim -- I'msorr it's about 70 pple active employees ft that wre lking about in the health care an.  400 are on the new, you ow, the RHRAlan and there's jus ove 300 peoe lefthat a active empyees th are going tbe entitled to the coverage.
00:33:30.192: >> Thank yo
00:33:30.759: >>o at some point when we talkbout the combined, like, the combined coributions, fiscal year22 are about0 million dollanticipated whicis almost 6-8% of our tol budget, right? So our tota expenditus anticiped in tt fiscal year.  S at me point tt's goi -- 're going to be pting less into that because it'slose or mainin a certain level I undetand and we' anticipating tse levels and future, that's -- we're donar with that, like, the'll be no more payts wn there's no more peoe pling onhat benet, is th correct?  And en what do we do?
00:34:15.003: >> Sure yrsn the futu.my,
00:34:19.074: >> You know, becse y'veot let's sa inhat group ttmay, you ve, Wendy,hat aretill geing theld type of heah care benefit Mbe they ar -40ears old at ts pot. rk ath yearsnd tn ve after that.  They have ng tailsut theore importt thi in ourisk mitition comme here, is -- and, again, I keep poting my arrow here. These new tiers over the long run we'll have different people on the benefit tier and it will take a while for those folk to cycle out but we will do that. The key is when they retire they're getting this benefit and so that becomes kind of the look.  I've got other closed plans.  You take a look out into the future and say, when will these benefits be a certain amount of assets. We're paying an asset to pay all those benefits and as we get to a future state where we got no current actives.  It's just an active retirees.  We have retirees and assets.  The assets are being drawn on.  At some point there's an inflection point and we'll have a decrease in liability there because you're paying out the assets but reducing that liability.  That's many years in the future.
00:35:37.753: >> I appreciate your use of -- you're talking about the long tail that the new hires have. As we move forward I know we have have had -- some departments asking for new hires and some going by adistribution -- attrition. Sometimes we pay them for a long time in the future for their service.  Thank you.
00:36:04.012: >> Jim, let me comment, one more thing.  Councilmember Hayner.  When the city, the contribution numbers I don't know what slide that was for each of the plans I think you said it totalled about 30 million dollars citywide.  And so as you think about budgeting for the general fund, it's important for councilmembers and staff to remember that since we plan our expenditures baseded on funds this -- only about two-thirds of that money for the pension is attributing to the general fund.  The other is paid by other funds.  This is particularly challenging here, I'm sorry, Jim, can you go to the slide that listed the -- I think if you go to the earlier presentation you'll see the makeup of the retirement system by group.  And what you'll see is a police and fire, for example, are all except for the senior members, are still in the full defined benefit plan.  They -- those two units combined make up by far the bulk of the general fund employees.  So what that means for you is as we go forward and budget for the general fund, this system is -- the -- how we fund this system is very important because it has a magnified affect on the general fund or a larger affect on the general fund than other funds because there's more defined benefit employees in general fund.
00:37:56.892: >> DCouncilmember Briggs.
00:37:57.692: >> To that point you just made, Mr. Crawford is there a point in the future that we anticipate that drawn in the general fund getting -- peaking to a particularly unwieldy number in our projection or --
00:38:14.009: >> Well, the nature of this I would say it's very challenging now.  The nature of the system as an open system is that as long as we are below 100% we continue to have a significant contribution that needs to be made we can get ourselves back to 100%, it's a much more moderate level.
00:38:37.399: >> And then, on the point of -- it sounded like it was best practice to review these assumptions every five years. But given how much the markets change in a five year period do those -- is it beneficial to review more often or are those assumptions holding pretty well as we look out over five years?
00:39:06.394: >> If I may -- oh, go ahead, Jim.
00:39:08.396: >> I was just going to say, I think it was very prudent.  It was part of the board engaged us to look at projections.  To look at investment term, that's the most important lever if you will.  That's discounting all these benefits, whether you're active or retired, et cetera, and so it's a great question because in the old days, you know, when I started out 25-30 years ago, yeah, it's every five years, let's look at that assumption and ever since GASB it's been more of a yearly exercise and we do have boards do exactly what Ann Arbor did and say, let's look at this. We still have three years to go until an experience study but let's kick the tires on the 7 percent assumption.  That's the way that the board was pretty at term.  Let me go back to my -- my own terms but -- the governance.  That governance -- the outline it's every five years but certainly we can look at these at any other time and I think that was just a good action that the board took in between experience levels. Does that answer your question?
00:40:17.399: >> Yeah, I think so, it sounds like the board is looking at them -- not just looking at them every five years.  They're ca kind of revisiting it every year and down to six and a half percent over I think that was the next five years.  Are those assumptions -- are we actually seeing that -- expected level of return?
00:40:48.129: >> Yeah, this is a great one because for a decade I've been hearing the sky is falling with returns.  You'll not here 5.7% for the next seven years and then you got that.  And before it was a great year.  Over time the expectations will earn that assumed rate.  That's what we're trying to get to with that and I just talked myself out of whatever else I was thinking about that.
00:41:17.559: >> I was also just going to add, thank you, Jim the audit committee does meet every spring.  And just to review are there any assumptions that we need to look at but the experience study is when a really deep dive is done.
00:41:42.550: >> That's the audit committee.
00:41:44.352: >> I apologize, thanks, Tom.
00:41:47.188: >> Councilmember Ramlawi.
00:41:49.791: >> I apologize for being late and thank you Councilmember Hayner for getting me in thanks for the presentation.  It's an improvement over the prior years.  I don't know what is different but it seems it has gotten improved this year.  So thanks, I just would like to maybe ask, it's the 64,000 dollar question perhaps.  But we heard about the exceptional gains the market has accomplished in the last ten years and we're not making significant strides in closing the gap on the pension fund. Is there a -- an easy explanation and I apologize, you might have already went over there, of why we're not making better gains when we're contributing, you know, supplement payments with the exception of last year, of course, and I know that -- we had made an exception because of COVID but I'm not sure, Mr. Crawford or anyone else could highlight what is keeping us from making better strides at getting to 100%.
00:43:04.699: >> I was going to let the others speak if you guys have comments on that.
00:43:08.670: >> Sure, I think it is great to note that is in our valuation report which is public record. We listed this year the market value return for each of the last ten years and so to your point.  Certainly, we've had -- and the other six years, if I'm doing the math right we missed our return.  Sometimes really close 6.9% in 2018.  And then  2 2020, 6.4.  That contributes. The other reason though, over the ten year period, and this is maybe where some good news is and that is going to be my answer to the previous question, this is alsoed on updated assumptions so the last experience that were not performed by us but brought in a mortality table that we would have recommended in terms of the latest and greatestest and there's a new table out the hope is as we continue to go with a lower discount rate. We keep up-to-date on the mortality table.  That serves to bump up that measured liability or measure what we'll fund eventually.  That's why I made the comment during the rt where I was talking about at Michigan plans look like. You know, it's one thing to be 85% funding at6.9% discount te.  The most common mortality table.  I'd much rather be the than95% fundg using assumptions that are out of date The other point is benefits d how that evold.  We saw with the genel group, t half i in the hybrid. Same with the stipend and medical plan.  We will see that impact inhe future but to ongoing, the level o benit impacts what's calle the normal cost.  That's like your expected aual cost i you're fully funded and that' o the order of, I wanto sayike i normal ct buthen you got this other amortization payme in addition  that to mak up for the past.  think it's a combation of our returns we've had r theenyears. Greater tu.  Six out of ten year the last te ars, lower.  Has beenartf it. And also these updated assut asmptions.
00:45:59.807: >> A oth questions?  Thank u, l, so ch, gratel f th work that you have done o our behalf.

00:46:41.749: >> Good evening, mayor, council, thank you very having me.  I believe I am going to be doing the presentation, Jackie.
00:47:03.271: >> Jennifer, you should have sharing ability now.
00:47:08.543: >> Okay.  Okay.  Can you see that?
00:47:17.518: >> You bet.
00:47:19.454: >> All right.  Great.  Thank you.  And I'm going to look to the side.  Hold on, let me pull that over.  I'm looking at my other screen while I'm talking. I'm going to have a lot of slides in here that I'll not go into great detail on.  They're more for your background information or if you have questions about them.  So you may have seen this slide.  It's got a few extra services from our last slide, from last year. This is our strategic objective for the upcoming five year plan.  980 units by 2026 and to develop a long-term strategy for tenants social services. I'm going to talk a bit about COVID but not that much.  This is a series of slides that are really for your background information because it relate to the upcoming budget that we're talking about.  One of the things that you might want to note is the amount of back owed rent as of January is 67,000 as compared to 58,000 last year in January.  That's not too bad.  But given that our tenants pay 30% of their income on rent compared to the private sector.  I guess it's not too unsurprising as well. In April of last year the city provided 200,000 dollars to respond to COVID related issues with the housing commission and our tenants.  And the plan is for the city to submit a FEMA application and if our portion of items does not get reimbursed, I do have a plan for paying back the city for those 200,000 dollars in this two year budget cycle.  We currently have $160,000 in this year's budget and we stop drawing down starting with February so we have about 66,000 dollars left to draw down and then I've reduced our general fund request by 70,000 dollars to 90,000 dollars.  For 22 and 23.  So that's a little over 200,000 dollars to reimburse the city from back in April.  When HUD finally did make some decisions about how to react to COVID, from a federal perspective, we actually are doing much better financially than we were a year ago because we received additional voucher subsidies than administrative fees and those are really where we're short where we don't have enough to administer our programs so we are actually doing quite well this year compared to any other year since I've been at the housing commission since 2011.  We also got awarded actual new vouchers annually renewed.  These are some of the items that we're spending our administrative fees.  It's not necessarily just for staff.  We have -- we paid all kinds of contracts with different organizations to provide benefits to our tenants to increase their ability to be housed with security deposits, application fees, we also help with, you know, cleaning and PPE and food assistance, et cetera, at the properties that we owned.  And at this point with all the work we've done with providing PPE, et cetera, we've had five families who have had COVID in the last year.  All of them are doing okay right now.  Thank goodness.  This is just for your information.  We opened up a waitlist in August.  It is all online and this is the number of applications we've had.  We had two, one for tenant and one for project based vouchers where the subsidies actually attach to the apartment -- it's not portable with a tenant.  I wanted to give you a little bit of a history of the change in our organization over the past ten-15 years but in particular since 2015 which is when we started our conversion of our public housing under the rental assistance demonstration program to project based vouchers.  This slide shows you not everyone ever every program we have but our biggest programs.  It doesn't include our millage funds but does include our voucher program funding, our affordable housing funds and our top number is actually pointing to the amount of general funds received each year that's related to operations.  And you can see a real change in both the amount of funding and the types of funding which is more clear on the next two slides.  This is just our voucher program.  You can see significant increases over the past few years on the voucher rental subsidy.  That's a combination of converting public housing.  As well as getting additional vouchers and you can see in red, the increase in administrative fees that actually enables us to run the program.  Doesn't change significantly from year to year until you get to the current year.  Due to the CARES Act administrative funds that we received.  And just for our affordable housing which is our housing that we own and manage. You can see a change in how we fund our programs from the green and red was the old public housing type model, blue is tenant rent and then the purple is the voucher program, rental subsidy and you can see that that has increased significantly and it's much higher than the amount of funding we received under public housing and we have just completed in December of this year, we occupied and constructed our last conversion you should the RAD program for our last public housing.  We have no more public housing. Moving into the future it will be -- our funding sources are much more reliable and much higher than in the past because of the type of subsidy being a voucher based subsidy not a public housing subsidy.  Okay, now I'm going to get into the specific budget, I'm going to talk about general fund.  The county mental health millage as well as the new affordable housing millage.  Within the general fund budget the change from the last two fiscal years as I mentioned earlier is to request 90,000 dollars instead of 160,000 dollars a year in general fund  That's reduction of 44%.  I'm requesting five additional FTEs but this has no budget impact because we pay -- the city invoices us for our staff and then we pay the city back.  And so there'll be no cost to the city in the general fund but it does get added to the budget as well as IT expenses.  Normally our IT expenses are paid for with general funds balance. But I added five staff to the general fund for Louis terrace staffing.  It will be showing up in the budget.  On the county mental health millage, rebate I'll spend a little bit of time on this. It's kind of complicated. Fiscal year 22 is estimated to be a million dollars, 23 is estimated a million six.  For the 40% portion of the total millage rebate.  In the last budget cycle, the housing human -- housing and human service advisory board and city council agreed to allocate 25% of that total amount to services in operating support for the housing commission and then 75% to capital projects. We actually ended up not needing for operating support. 100% of that we want to services to our nonprofits that provide either onsite services or voucher support services so in fiscal year '21.  25% of the budget was 235,000 dollars at that time during the negotiation ere was a request for an inease of 300,000 dollars to go to mental health services.  Tt amount ended upcomi out of the fund balance of tha mlage.  It wasn't cing out of the general fund So the total amou for fiscal year 21 was 53000 llars.  And that happened f both year  S what I'm reqsting for this so next budget cycle is that we contin that amount within the ment health millage rebate to services with our nonprofit health and other tenant l this dicatedffordable w have housing millage for the capital there's tually som capacy  so thin that count mtal health millage s wha are those services I'm requesting, soy, 546,000 for fiscal year 22 which is a 2% incree and 557 for fiscal year 23.  The contractthat we ha are listed here.  Community actn center Avon, foodhborhd gaerers, SOS andozone.  A of those contrts come out of the lle rebateight w. And Iou likeoe able to ntinue those ctrts and continue tseervices tur tenants. hat leave roughly 4,000 dolrs in 20.  And 50000ollars i fisca year am requesng, recmending that we set those Funds aside. last couple of years we've had some serious fires cause a lot of building damage and a lot of fear among our residents. Thankfully nobody was seriously injured and so we have a contractor coming out to give us a engineering cost estimate to do the design. And we'll issue an RFP if these funds get approved for that. Originally I thought it would exceed a million dollars but because the building actually has a sprinkler system on the first floor like in a mechanical room, we already have some of the infrastructure in place and so based on that it might actually come in at less than a million dollars. But we won't know until we actually bid it out. But I'd like to have some money set aside for that. If I need to raise additional funding if it's more than a million dollars, but I'll have to find additional funding for that. There's currently a fund balance from the first year of the millage of about $234,000. So Tom and I talked about setting money aside for an eventual pilot program for creating hopefully in coordination with the county, but it could be more Ann Arbor centric for mental health medical response for psychiatric emergencies instead of police response. Do not know what that total cost would be, but we thought we should put a line item just to hold it for a program. And Tom can talk more about that as well. Should I stop here and see if there's questions on this portion?
01:00:35.816: >> How much more do you have on your slides?
01:00:38.752: >> I probably have 5 or 6 more slides.
01:00:45.959: >> Thank you. I think my questions are pretty quk. On slide 15, I'm wondering if I heard you wrong or I have a clarifying question about you said the millage. As I remember discussion, we didn't declare that 25% would be spent on support services. I thought that we had sort of set a ceiling and said that no more than 25% would be spent on support services. Maybe you can help me remember that correctly.
01:01:18.592: >> It ended up being more than 25% did end up being spent because of that extra 300,000. And so what I'm asking is can we remove that 25% cap or amount, however you want to look at it and actually spend roughly half towards the mental health and tenant support services.
01:01:40.447: >> I think there's a distinction between the proposal C millage and the county mental health millage. Proposal C including --
01:01:55.762: >> Then my other question was on slide 16 which you mentioned a moment ago. This is really exciting the idea of this pilot program and I appreciate that it sounds like it's very much in the beginning stages. But I'm wondering if that is something that you're collaborating with our police department on?  I assume obviously, but I am very excited about that.
01:02:31.265: >> Jennifer, I can comment on that. This is certainly in the early stage. They have both expressed a strong interest in having some kind of response like this. We're working with the county because they would provide something like this. And it strikes us that having the kind of staffing you want on call, you really need scale I would say we are very early on on this. I don't have any details. I have some meetings coming up to start to flush this out a little bit. Be you the chief and I, this is literally just a placeholder at this point. But the chief and I and Mr. Fornier are working on that.
01:03:27.354: >> COUNCILOR NELSON: I appreciate hearing that. Thanks.
01:03:33.360: >> One of the things in conversation with the chief in this topic is I think it's important to articulate the importance of work with county on this. Obviously if we could stand it up on our own, that would be excellent as well. There is however a great benefit to having county's participation. I concurring this a very exciting opportunity. And we'll continue.
01:04:07.828: >> Hands coming up. I want to make sure you get to the end before folks run out. But perhaps we'll give her the opportunity to finish.
01:04:32.219: >> Perhaps my colleague is going to speak on the issue. I would like to see conversations be interwoven with the leadership and with the commission of APOC when it comes to this pilot program. I appreciate using the resources that the county has with dispatch and getting the calls of people to the right places. But we have our own local police commission that I think needs to be a critical component of this program. Thank you. Linh Song.
01:05:19.833: >> COUNCILOR SONG: If there's any way we can get similar programming in cahoots and the street response, there's other work already being done in other municipalities when it comes to deploying mental health workers in crisis-related work. So this is really fitting. I echo Council member Nelson and Councilmember Ramlawi. But it is a lot of money. So if there's any way we can work with the county. This is the fiscal year after the coordinated funding commitments end so I'm wondering if there's additional funding that could be captured for this work too.
01:06:15.388: >> Councilmember Hayner.
01:06:22.929: >> COUNCILER HAYNER: Is this something that you're targeting at the county or do we anticipate that this is sort of, it might be designed to help the folks in our housing system or would it be for the community at large?
01:06:48.188: >> I would anticipate it's the community at large. Obviously we have experienced mental health, psychiatric crises at our properties and the police response was not necessarily the type of response we would have liked as far as being overly aggressive and not doing what the mental health aspects of what was going on. And yet it being such that they needed some kind of emergency response. So I'm familiar with and have had conversations with other folks with other programs around the United States, most of those programs are funded from taking a portion of the police budget and allocating it toward this kind of program. We happen to have fund balance in this one particular budget so at least that would start it out as a placeholder for that kind of program to be discussed as a starting point. Whether it's with the county which I agree the county is the mental health service provider for the county. They are the dispatch system and when you're talking about a 24/7 type of response that's a lot of staffing. So having some economies of scale is very much a benefit.
01:08:15.242: >> It's important to realize that when police respond, they respond because someone has called for police assistance and they have to respond in that case and they will respond. For real success, we have to get to a point where community members understand that they don't need a 911 response, they need a different response, or they call 911 and 911 isrganized in a manner to convert that cal to a different response. But our police are by nessity responding. We don't know, police don't know what the ent is uil they arrive. And frequently it's differenthan what the call appears to be at first. Is a challging tuation.
01:08:59.486: >> Right.And if we don't have an alternative, then youave what you have.
01:09:06.092: >> Dyou want to fish us out? Yep. Il do that. Tse are some of our other community rtners, not all of whom we pay for contractual serces but we do wor with them. And a t affordab housing millage,he newmillage, the estimated amounts for 223 are 6.5nd $6.3 million a year. If people were not on council wn council in July this summazed itbut they were a lite bit more in depth than wha I show here. So the idea is up to 60 of area median income, ican include all sorts of housing costs from soft st hard cost demolitionet cetera.nd ts is where 20% was served, no more tha20% of theillageor supporti svices for millage-deveped its,otor be relate to the uts tt ardeloped by the llage. Suaibility wpriotized, permanenafrdabilityith a al of socio-econom diversity thughout the city. And ximizing andevaging other resource Wt Imroposing that w do a how we approach thmillage i tha as wo o foll it up th the second year budget, that we loo at where we're at and what projects are in the pipeline with the housing commission, particularly with city-owned properties and we look at where they are, at what stage they are, and what funding needs they have. But not to only set aside funding for those projects because there's always projects that unexpectedly come on the marketplace and we want to be able to build in some flexibility so we can do an acquisition. We are not nimble. We are not nimble as a governmental agency to acquire properties. We are not nimble as the housing commission working with the city council to acquire properties. So anything we can do to build in a nimble response so we can be competitive when a property comes on the market, we want to have some money set aside for that each year. But the housing commission will not be the only developer. And so we need to actually take those guidelines that city council adopted and put some meat on them, put some depth on them, and put some more specific guidelines on them to make sure that we have investments in projects that are feasible, that by developers that are qualified. And so you need to have guidelines around what is eligible use, leveraging other funding sources, doing a subsidy review so that you're not over sub subsidizing a project. The number of years, is it a grant, is it a loan, looking at development costs, looking at experience, defining what service funding looks like, not just what services are provided but how much you would fund for those types of services and then develop some outcomes. Once we have those guidelines developed and my recommendation is that I would work with community development and HHSAB on developing those guidelines. They already have housing fund guidelines. We could start with that, see what needs to be refined. They don't have anything about services in those guidelines, so that's something that would be new that would be eligible. Once we have those we bring them back to city council for city council approval. And then after that as funding is available, we could issue RFPs. And that RFP response would be reviewed by staff as well as the HHSAB and project would be recommended to city council similar to what we do right now with the Ann Arbor affordable housing fund. And that's how you get a broader group of developers utilizing the millage funds. But keep in mind that the city owned properties that we're looking at developing right now, that's probably 6, 7, 8 years worth of millage funding is not necessarily going to be the first 6 or 8 years. But it is a lot of funding that would be needed to fill in that gap financing for those city-owned properties. And it will take probably 6 to 8 months to a year to develop some really good guidelines to bring back to you. In addition, just keep in mind that when you talk about up to 20% of funding being for services, if it's an acquisition project, then the capital and services request would be at the same time. So when you acquire the building, day one you start your services because you've got tenants living there. If it's a new construction project, you would request the capital funds in advance of the services because you actually don't need services until the building is built. And so we need to come up with an internal mechanism in an annual budget tracking system for projects that have capital funds that are going to be requesting services or have requested services so that we're tracking that over time into the future so that we make sure we have those funds reserved. By requesting in this upcoming budget cycle that three FDEs be added specifically for development, 100% development related paid for with the millage funds including funding for IT costs. And then $400,000 a year for all of that predevelopment due diligence work that happens, environmental review surveys, legal, you know title work, all of that kind of stuff and earnest money if needed for securing and locking in a purchase agreement. And then when it comes to actual projects, what I'm recommending is for fiscal year 22 and fiscal year 23 a little over $5 million for 350 South 5th. You can see in this case I don't have any dollars for services in those two fiscal years because it will not be built until probably fiscal year 24 or fiscal year 25 so there's no reason to like put money for services in now when we do not need them for 2 or 3 more years. We just need to know that we will be needing them in 2 or 3 more years and make sure we budget for that. The other projects I have in here are 121 East Catherine. About 1.2 million for capital funds, nothing for services yet. 353 South Main, 1.45 million for capital nothing in services yet. And this is what I put on an acquisition. Many of you are aware of the acquisition project that I was working on. The owner has decided to sign a purchase agreement with another offer. But we are certainly a back up to that offer. But those funds are in there as an acquisition in case something comes up in the marketplace so that we have funding to acquire it. Alternatively I had to put this budget together and submitted it for the public prior to finding out that the acquisition project I was working on did not actually happen. So that was in there for a specific project. Alternatively we could set funding aside here for further sprinkler systems for Laurie Terrace. Neither of which had spr sprinkler systems throughout the building. Laurie Terrace had a fire in January, and it brought three apartments offline that are still offline. I am also recommending that we set aside money in fiscal year 22 and 23 for projects in the pipeline right now. The timing is urgent because they are at their final stage. They have already had the site process, they have already had city HUD home funds allocated. So they've already gone through a competitive process for local funding and they're ready to go right now. One is Hickory Way phase two, and the other is Hickory Way phase three. So these are the final capital gap financing that's needed as well as immediate or very soon service funding. And the service funding is for all three phases because when you do the services on a site, you don't divide the budget up by building, you serve a whole building and everybody who's there at the same time. The third project is the Grove at Veridian with 1.1 million in capital. That's the very highest amount they will need. They've got two other applications in for other funding that they're just waiting to hear from. And so it may be less than that if they're able to secure those other financial sources. Because Veridian is not under construction yet, it is not ready to go constructed, there's no money in services, they won't need that for a couple of years. I will actually be bringing back council resolutions separate from this budget for each of those projects for city council to actually vote on separately. It will be required by their other funders to have that actual affirmative city council resolution. It's not just a budget discussi. This is just a reminder of where we're at on our pipeline of projects to meet our affordable housing goals. Here's just a summary of the city owned sites and kind of low end, high-end of affordable apartments depending on how they're financed and what we end up doing there. Anywhere from 500 to 1500. And then I've got two slides on the next step. So immediately coming up, we're aiming for the first meeting in April actually, it's the report back on our community engagement at the four sites we did commity engagement on. That's going to include a downtown parking analysis and recommendations, heavy on the recommendations given the Covid impact on parking. And then a downtown housing market analysis incorpored into that as well. 415 st Waington, so on the same nht probably that we ing back the community engagement,e'll bri back a recommendation to change t city councilas a rolution now provg the housing commission as a developerf 415 West Washington. We're going to recommendhat get changed so thathe petitioner for doi the pre-entitlement actually gets switched to be the City o Ann Arbor itself rathethan the housing commission. Based onll of the preous dcussions of the other comtitive public need wants at that site,t's gog to be ver challengingo inude affordable using. There y still be affordable housing, buthat'sot a primary, that' probably o all the sit I'm looking at reveping that because of the chlenges of e sitet would be my lowest priorityThat doesn't mea I not looking at it to develop , is just n a high prrity. The's a lot of oer public needsor that site. And then it uld be after we go tou the p would do an RFPor a public delor. Ty' bring back evalon specic cncil resoluons andgnehe last buet poi becau that  not happening less somethingew happens.nd then the next two scal years, my priorities are to hire staff so we can make some progress on these actual projects, develop that application process that I discussed, get site plan zoning and financing, the three highest priorities for me are Catherine, Main, and 5th. We have a council resolution already. Approval from city council naming the housing commission as the developer of Catherine. We do not have similar resolutions for Main. We do have one for 350 South 5th already. We're going to be bringing back a recommendation to split the lot at 721 North Main so that we pull out the part that's developable, that's high and dry that's not in the floodplain floodway. And I'll be working on an RFP for community engagement for our property we own on plat. Not the one we're developing, but across the street. And Industrial has continued site analysis going on. I think that's my last slide. Yep.
01:23:43.869: >> Councilmember Ramlawi.
01:23:51.410: >> COUNCILOR RAMLAWI: My questions pertain to a couple of things. One you said the agency is not as nimble as you wish, how city council is not as nimble. If you could just perhaps let us know now or later what policy issues that we can arid -- address to make us more nimble and get to our goals sooner. I don't know if anything else sticks out right now that's actionable, but we'd like to maybe know what those hurdles are in terms of being nimble?
01:24:25.644: >> Yeah, I mean the primary thing is because we're public bodies, there's a lot of public, there's many public approval processes, and those are good and they're there for a reason. I don't know that you'd want to eliminate them per se, it just makes it harder for us to compete with the private sector, unless you have a buyer who is willing to wait for you to go through my board approval and bringing something to city council for approval. I think it just is what it is. I don't know if you want to change that to be honest.
01:25:08.320: >> COUNCILOR RAMLAWI: I appreciate the honesty and no, I wouldn't. I believe in checks and balance. So it's good to have that due process. My other main policy issue is FTEs and when you went through it earlier tonight about the pension health care and the legacy cost of FTEs, I think in this presentation you pointed out the need for perhaps five FTEs. And I'm wondering and I'll need to know more later I guess once the job descriptions are developed, what these FTEs will be doing. In the case of the construction of the new developments, I kind of wonder whether an FTE is the best long-term solution, whereas I'm not one to jump to say we should hire consultants, but I know for example our building department will hire outside help during the busy building season so we don't carry those fixed costs through the slower times. And I'm just wondering if we're going to start off building ambitiously, but then that's going to taper off and we're not going to be building at the rate we're initially going to be, yet we have these FTEs signed up for construction purposes. Secondly is the mental health and whether the $254,000 could be spent in what could be folks who and I think this might be the case where you have in house staff who are there 24/7 to help mitigate the need for 911 and have people on the premise in some of these developments that could take care of these needs before they get escalated to a 911 call in conjunction with additional mental health or a police force to respond to every other thing. But for the properties you manage, I would perhaps suggest whether that's currently the case.
01:27:10.809: >> For the FTEs there's two types of FTEs. So for Laurie Terrace that was the five FTEs there's a property manager, a person who manages the wait list and does leasing and a leasing agent. Those are the five positions. The maintenance would actually be joining our maintenance team and providing maintenance at all sites throughout the city. So it's billed in a different way. And I do think it raises a question of what are the nimbleness separate from development, but a nimbleness is also our ability to hire staff and respond to acquiring properties. And I do think there is a legitimate question that won't be resolved tonight, but on how many properties can the housing commission realistically develop, and how many properties can they realistically manage. And if we aren't doing the property management, that raises an issue on if we're contracting for that, that raises a real issue on our current union staff that do that kind of property management. Like how do you work through those kinds of things. So I definitely have been thinking a lot about that because it just takes so long to get positions approved. It's expensive positions compared to contracting out something like that. But at the same time the reason they're expensive is because they're getting appropriate benefits that the private sector isn't necessarily paying for as well as we are definitely an agency that screens tenants in, tries to keep people housed which is very different than a private property management company. I would feel more comfortable partnering with somebody like Avalon Housing that I know shares our perspective on how we manage properties. So that's definitely something I've been thinking about moving into the future on how to at post construction, post development, I'm more worried about the management part than I am on the development side. For the three FTEs in the budget for specific to development, my thought is I need an administrative assistant. I don't care how many consultants I hire, I still have to write their contracts, do RFPs, meet with them, oversee their work, and I'm the only one doing it in my organization, I'm like I cannot do anymore. I just can't. So like there is more than enough work that requires even with like I'm not the attorney, but I have to hire him. I'm not the surveyor, but I have to hire them. I have to hire environmental people, I have to hire the title company. I have to hire all of these different people and I still have to manage their contracts too. The second position I'd like to hire is a development director, like somebody who is a highly skilled, has done both, hopefully my ideal candidate will have done both market rate and subsidized housing. Although I know how to do the financing for subsidized housing for the properties we would do some kind of mixed income housing, that's not my background and area of expertise. So I would like to find somebody who knows how to do that. If I have somebody with that kind of expertise, then I can give them many of those roles that I'm performing now. And then I put in a third position that would be sort of a mid position, not the director, not administrative assistant, but there's a lot of leg work that has to happen. We're closing on Laurie Terrace hopefully this Thursday. And we're still after a year and a half finalizing details on issues that are still continuing to happen that you have to solve on complicated property transactions. It's just they're complicated. It's a lot of work to do development. So my thought is I hired the administrative assistant first because we've already got that position defined as a city position in the union. Then I would get approval for the position of the director and then work with those two. And I don't think I would hire that third position until we get moving and see where we're at and see how much additional hands on work we need as a staff person. It is a 20 year millage so I feel like for 20 years we'll definitely have enough work for additional staff.
01:32:23.855: >> Council members Griswo, Briggs, and then we'll wrap it up.
01:32:32.831: >> I was going to say I appreciate your leadership and expertise. But I guess I should add all of the extra effort and extra me you put into this, it's amazing. And yes, we definitely needo be age. I've seen some o that. I'm just ndering aut the ber property if tt's something that we n be more nimble
01:32:57.889: >> The 1 Across the Streetrom the Weber property
01:33:02.594: >> The Weber property.
01:33:09.301: >> With the trees, yes.
01:33:11.536: >> Gotcha Not currently on my radar as pperty to acquire. But that's gd examp of even le the propertyhat you guys are awaref that I was lookin at, I had hired a altor, an attorn, and an archect and we had spent prably 50, 60 hours of work on it by the time I foundut that we weren't going tbe able to buy theproperty And so there a lot of that, that's why I had thatpredevelopme lineitem. There's ot of due diligce you have to do. First you bece aware ofomething and then you ha to figure out if it's feasible and whether it' the environmtal issues, allf e the kinds of thgs, tt can certaiy look a it.. I on the nex agen, but it n esn't necearily come tough yo partment.nd just he e oer coen I conrned abouthe21 East Cheri st bause othe controversy around it. And I'm wondering if we should start with less controversial properties that would have a more opportunity for success and support from the community?
01:34:45.497: >> I know you've answered some of the questions around that and the ratings system, but it's one of the things that keeps me up at night. Thank you for everything you do.
01:34:54.339: >> Yeah, you're welcome.
01:35:03.515: >> I'm sorry. Council member Grand.
01:35:09.521: >> COUNCILOR GRAND: I'm super excited about the East Catherine property. We've had some great conversations at the housing commission with the board. I think there's some exciting opportunities to speak to the history of that area on the first floor. Anyway, I'm really looking forward to it and my questions were answered at our housing commission meeting. I know you'll hopefully relieve concerns on either side of that question. I think she did an excellent job explaining the FTEs so when that concern was raised I wanted to jump in and just say that while Jennifer Hall has shown tremendous leadership and work, we should not expect our director of this commission to be superhuman 365 days out of the year. And if we have these ambitious goals, I'm really supportive of getting staff in with that development expertise so that she can do the work in leading that organization. Because there is plenty of work to go around if we're going to fund these projects and also have that flexibility. So hopefully next time there's an acquisition opportunity to be able to step in and do something equally exciting. So thank you for this presentation. I'm excited to move forward on these three properties. They are really a high priority for me personally. And we want to get this support in so we can get moving with them.
01:36:56.394: >> Councilmember Hayner.
01:37:00.532: >> COUNCILOR HAYNER: I also wanted to extend my public thank you for always responding to my emails and so on. And also seeing in the budget that you're anticipating this notion of having more agility. I know it was a real run around on that one. And as we had other non-profits that kind of formed up and reached out to us to get that going and it just went to open market. I think we're doing ourselves a favor by being prepared to acquire places as they become available, as we've seen with some other kind of attempts, rental situations here in town especially large ones that are, we have like senior housing and things like that, I think we need to remain flexible and with your eyes open for opportunity not only to acquire new housing but to keep people in housing. So thank you very much for putting that into your budget.
01:37:58.256: >> Councilmember Song.
01:38:02.560: >> COUNCILOR SONG: I was just wondering if you could speak a little bit to your thoughts on any potential federal funding coming down the line that you haven't tapped into or might be in consideration. I know I saw a little bit of something in I think the Equal Justice Reform Act. I think Mr. Fornier passed that on. And my second question is are there other funding mechanisms that we can consider to I guess support these efforts like CDFIs?  I know CDFIs have been used in Dearborn in supporting interesting affordable housing efforts there, supporting artists in an artist loft that you see at the old city hall. So anyways, those are my two questions on seeing if we can chase down. Please chase down more money for us.
01:39:11.596: >> For the federal funds from what I can tell so far with the limited details that have been published so far, the vast majority of new funding appears to me to be three types; home and block grant which is administered by the county for the city. Those are key gap funding sources for all of these different projects. So like the three Avalon projects I brought up earlier, they've all received home funding, we've received block grant funding. So it is a key way to fill that gap in addition to millage funds. And I always want to try using some other funds first before the millage. And I think we should always try to be leveraging and always using our millage funding to leverage funds. I don't think we should think of it as a free bank. We want as many units as possible. So we have to leverage funds. The other place that funding is going to is the state through their trust fund I think is what they call it at the state level which we also can apply for. We've applied for and haven't received funding, but if they have more funding that's good because it's statewide. The only funding that was for housing commissions per se ironically was for public housing which we don't have anymore. They're finally getting additional public housing funds that are needed for those that did not convert. I worked with, Lisk in the past. I've worked with I can't think of the name but another organization that does certain kinds of financing that are for mixed income type housing and we were looking at it for 350 South 5th and we just couldn't make it work with the regulatory guidelines. I think there's always an opportunity, but it's going to be site specific as to what can be done. But yeah, absolutely.
01:41:11.816: >> Thank you.
01:41:14.452: >> Yeah, you're welcome.
01:41:16.254: >> Other questions for Ms. Hall? Ms. Hall, thank you very much. We obviously have here a lot to be excited about. For years we've wanted to take real steps forward with respects to building new housing and with the passage of the millage, it's clear we have a lot of opportunity to do so and I'm for my part excited to Councilmember Grand's statement, excited to see we have plans and the commitment to move forward specifically because we have folks that work in Ann Arbor that don't live in Ann Arbor and we want to change all of that. So thanks.
01:42:12.110: >> Thanks.

01:43:43.234: >> Hello. Hi, it's Shannon calling again. I figured if I lled last week to yell at you, I needed to call you again this week to offer my thanks. I would like to thank the council members who signed the better about schools. I think it was really pointed and really appreciated by so many parents in this community who are really, really struggling right now including myself. It's been a long time that we've had a lot of hope for the schools and what happened last week at the board meeting was really quite shocking and unacceptable nestly to kind of rip the rug out from under so many families who were expecting that their kids at least at some point would be able to go back into the clasoom, meet their teachers, be wit some of their friends and the peers. And'm just really appreciative that yo guys took a stand here becausechools are so integral to our city. S many people desire t live here and just kids reallneed school. Iean comfortable sending theirids school right now, but I think we've allind of agreed as a society that public schools are a public good for a varietyf reasons. I know peopl can get to have a school closure and a little bit of a cebration, but spend money  small business when I'm spending allf my money on cld care. Schls are rely, really important. A I just rlly needed toay that d to say tha you once agn. d Iope itoes represent hope that things will get better d we can open schools and vaccinate o teachs and we caopen our sool doors. Ann Arbor can do this. Tnkou so much.
01:45:47.658: >> MAYORHRISTOPHER TAYR:
01:45:54.932: >> Calr wh the pne number ding in 34 do yoha a coent? came las wk to ask for hold note rightownd think I'mmy is again. I just want to point out that we're still seeking opportunities to save the demolition and use it for community and public goods. There have been a lot of ideas that have come forward and a couple of strong ones that we can do with the funds that we have currently raised. People have come forward to put into restoring the building and could go into escrow right now if the city would be willing to work with us. And there's also some activity reported on the site last Thursday. So some of the neighbors are concerned and we're requesting again that the city ensures its agents cease all activities related to demolition to respect the use rights of the residents that haven't been quite, I believe the city attorney is still looking at. Not only will saving this building help, it's a really strong building. Saving it has a smaller carbon footprint and reduce environmental impacts of demolition. The resource and economic savings are substantial. They're expected to cover the cost of repair and volunteers are ready to help. At a time budgets are being cut, jobs are being cut, we can create a place of community that gives purpose and resilience for the people around here. And this neighborhood does not have any other common community building. It has never really had a good place for people to congregate and so this would help them do that. But we've had some confusing information come from the board that the community doesn't have an interest in the title which city council did accept the warranty deed for that parcel with the deed restrictions it came with. And we would like that clarified because it's confusing neighbors and upsetting some who I think would like more support being able to save this building if we can.
01:48:43.100: >> 30 seconds.
01:48:47.505: >> Also it has a lot of potential for a sustainable reuse and we just really feel strongly that it could be very good for the community. And we have residents supporting neighbors in the neighborhoods around that want the city to reconsider the building if it can be saved for community or public use. It's a greater impact to the larger community. Let's make the sustainable choice to reduce climate change.
01:49:18.636: >> Time.
01:49:19.804: >> Which is for the survival of us all. Thank you.
01:49:23.941: >> MAYOR CHRISTOPHER TAYLOR: Thank you.
01:49:31.148: >> Caller with a phone number ending in 205, do you have a comment?  Caller 205, do you have a comment? mute. Hi, my name is Joe  on Spalding and I live in Holland, Michigan and I just want to say that I appreciate the time of council tonight. And I have something a little bit different I want to be speaking about during general time here briefly. One of the things that I do in my free time for the last ten years anyway has been help run -- for college students. This is something I'm really passionate about. I really like seeing the gears click in these students when they're learning about these processes specifically in diplomacy. And it's very important to me. One of the people I work with there is Dr. Brian Endless out of Loyola he's a professor of many subjects including African studies. He's a close friend with Paul who is who I want to talk about briefly right now. Paul is the hero portrayed in the movie Hotel Rwanda. He was kidnapped by the Rwandan government and rendered back a months ago, two months ago, and he's facing a sham trial right now. And the hashtag that folks are following and the movement folks are following on that, I just want to encourage people to look into his story and see what's going on. There's some news stories that have broken in the New York Times, some other outlets where they're laying out exactly what happened. But obviously he didn't fly back in order to just get arrested and there's been some serious suppression of free speech in Rwanda that he's been speaking out adamantly against. And that's frankly why he got silenced. And so for everything on top of this being connected to a very dear friend of mine, this is about free speech and that's an issue I'm passionate about. I'm sure everybody on council is passionate about, so I just want to encourage folks that are seeing this stream and hearing me talk about council members or housing or whatever to look into this and try to boost the signal. Because right now too few people are talking about it. Thanks everyone.
01:52:24.889: >> MAYOR CHRISTOPHER TAYLOR: Thank you.
01:52:27.992: >> Mayor, I don't see any other callers with their hands up at this time.
01:52:34.665: >> MAYOR CHRISTOPHER TAYLOR: For anyone who would like to speak in public comment enter star 9 now.
01:52:44.742: >> Caller with a phone number ending in 534, do you have a comment?
01:52:49.880: >> Good evening, this is Tom calling from the heart of lower town. I want to bring up a specific example of an individual who applied for one of the affordable housing units at our lower town development. And this could apply to other places as well too. And I know Councilmember Hayner and Ms. Hall know the details a lot better. I know you're not necessarily responding to me at this time. But hopefully this is something that can be looked into and understood by everybody to see how this works. In essence there were 15 units at this approximately 620 development in the approval that's part of the Brownfield where we got 15 units of affordable housing. As most of you know we should have had 93 units of affordable housing at that site and had it been approved of a PUD, exact same site plan been approved as a PUD as it was master planned as a PUD, zoned a PUD and approved in a very convoluted way to avoid the 93 units of affordable housing on site that would have been required. So there's an additional 15 units in the Brownfield. Those are 60% AMI units. So somebody making about $20 an hour, no more, could qualify for that. Somebody applied for one of those units and the developer apparently has some ability to turn people down if they don't make a certain minimum amount. And in this case I'm approximating, but it was around $15 an hour. So this person needed to make less than 20 to qualify but if they didn't make at least 15, the developer, landlord now, Morningside could turn them down and the person did not get housing at that site. So I think we kind of need to look into how that system works and I know in our premiums, we tightened up our premiums a year and a half ago. And we were looking to encourage more affordable housing units to be built as part of a project not just to make the payments in lieu. I don't know if that needs to be relooked at in light of, either we have to do better with the units on site, how we actually provide housing for people. Or that money should maybe be looked at as directed to payments in lieu so that money can be used for dedicated developers of affordable housing for example. And at the time we made those premiums we were thinking that not enough units were getting built. So we didn't necessarily just want payments in lieu, we wanted units built. Now we have this affordable housing millage, and we are developing city-owned sites. So maybe it is the time to re-examine what is the best option. And it's
