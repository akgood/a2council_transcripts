[CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED IN THE AGENDA IS APPROVED. DO WE HAVE COMMUNICATIONS FROM OUR CITY ADMINISTRATOR? MR. CRAWFORD. YOU ARE ON MUTE.
00:01:50.858: >> City Admin. Crawford: HAD TO BE THAT GUY. I WANTED TO TAKE A MOMENT TO POINT OUT THAT ON THE AGENDA, YOU HAVE A RESOLUTION BETWEEN THE CITY AND RECYCLE ANN ARBOR. IT'S A CONTRACT THAT'S TAKEN QUITE SOMETIME TO COMPLETE, BUT WE'RE VERY PLEASED THAT -- TO BRING YOU THIS CONTRACT TONIGHT AFTER A LOT OF WORK BY BOTH RECYCLE ANN ARBOR AND THE CITY. SO I JUST WANTED TO EXPRESS MY THANKS FOR EVERYONE WHO WORKS SO HARD IN BRINGING THAT TO YOU. THAT'S ALL.
00:02:21.388: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. WE NOW HAVE THE MONTHLY UPDATE FROM OUR INDEPENDENT COMMUNITY POLICE OVERSITE COMMISSIONS CHAIR, DR. JACKSON. DR. JACKSON, YOU HAVE THE COM.
00:02:43.811: >> Clerk Beaudry: MAYOR, DR. JACKSON IS JOINING US NOW.
00:02:45.913: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
00:02:46.880: >> GOOD EVENING. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T KNOW ME, MY NAME IS LUCY JACKSON, I'M THE CHAIR OF ANN ARBOR'S INDEPENDENT COMMUNITY POLICE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION. ALSO KNOWN AS ICPOC. IT WAS TO IMPROVE THE RELATIONS BETWEEN THE COMMUNITY AND THE ANN ARBOR POLICE DEPARTMENT BUT ALSO TO EXAMINE POLICING POLICIES AND FACILITATE COOPERATION BETWEEN THE MANY DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED IN KEEPING OUR COMMUNITY SAFE. AFTER TWO YEARS, WE FINALLY COME TO AN AGREEMENT WITH THE POLICE DEPARTMENT ON AN APPROPRIATE TIMELINE FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO DELIVER INFORMATION TO OUR COMMISSION, SUCH AS THAT WE CAN REVIEW COMPLAINTS FILED TO THEM IN A TIMELY MANNER, AND WHILE IT MIGHT SEEM DISHEARTENING TO MANY THAT IT'S TAKEN SO LONG TO REACH SUCH AN AGREEMENT, ABOUT SOMETHING SO UNCONTROVERSIAL EVEN, I THINK THIS DOES REPRESENT A HUGE STEP FORWARD AND I WOULD LIKE TO THANK CHIEF COX, DEPUTY CHIEFS, AND ARIAN SLAY, AND OTHERS FOR THE WORK THEY HAVE DONE TO FOSTER COLLABORATION BETWEEN ALL OF OUR ORGANIZATIONS. BEFORE I GET INTO MY MAIN TOPIC FOR TODAY, I WOULD LIKE TO WRAP UP BLACK HISTORY MONTH BY RECOGNIZING, ALBERT WHEELER. I'M SURE YOU ALL KNOW HIM. HE WAS ANN ARBOR'S FIRST AND ONLY BLACK MAYOR. HE WAS THE FIRST TENURED PROFESSOR AND EVEN BEFORE RUNNING FOR MAYOR, HE FORMED BLACK UNITED FOR LIBERATION AND JUSTICE OUT OF CONCERN ABOUT EXCESSIVE POLICE PATROL OF THE BLACK COMMUNITY AND WHAT HE CONSIDERED HARASSMENT AND ILLEGAL ARRESTS. AFTER ACCUSING CITY LEADERS AFTER -- OF ALLOWING RACIST POLICING, TO DEAL HONESTLY AND PROPERLY WITH THESE CHARGES HAS CAUSED THE BLACK COMMUNITY TO LOSE FAITH IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT'S WILLINGNESS AND ABILITY TO DEAL WITH ITS OWN EMPLOYEES. HE WON A CONTROVERSIAL ELECTION IN MAYOR IN 1975 AND HE AND HIS WIFE STARTED A GROUP THAT BECAME THE LOCAL NAACP CHAPTER AND WERE LONG-TIME PUBLIC SERVANTS WHO HELPED TO CHANGE ANN ARBOR'S RACIAL CLIMATE. HE WAS ALSO CREDITED WITH INSTILLING THE IDEA THAT CITY GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE INVOLVED IN HUMAN SERVICES TO HELP DISADVANTAGED CITIZENS. THE MAIN POINT TO WHICH I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK THIS EVEN REGARDS OPPORTUNITIES PRESENT WITHIN THE CITY'S UPCOMING BUDGET. FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOT AWARE, COUNCIL VOTES ON MAY 17th TO PASS THE CITY'S ANNUAL BUDGET. AS ALL OF YOU KNOW, THIS PAST YEAR HAS BEEN CHALLENGING, FOR BOTH LOCAL BUSINESSES AND THE CITY ITSELF. AS A RESULT, THE CITY HAS ASKED EACH OF ITS AGENCIES TO GIVE UP A PERCENTAGE OF THEIR ANNUAL BUDGET TO OFFSET ITS SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED REVENUE. IN RESPONSE, POLICE CHIEF COX OFFERED THE CITY $1.3 MILLION, AND FIRE CHIEF KENNEDY OFFERED OVER $700,000. UNFORTUNATELY NOT EVERY AGENCY IS EQUALLY ABLE TO SHED PARDON -- PARTS OF THEIR BUDGET AND AT THE SAME TIME, IT BROUGHT FINANCIAL CHALLENGES IT ALSO HIGHLIGHTED SOCIAL CHALLENGES THAT MUST BE ADDRESSED THROUGH INTENTIONAL PUBLIC REFORM. FOR EXAMPLE, THE CITY RECEIVED A REQUEST FROM THE SUSTAINABILITY OFFICE FOR AN EXTRA $3.6 MILLION FOR THE A2ZERO CARBON NEUTRALITY PROGRAM. TO BE VERY CLEAR, ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY AND REIMAGINING. PUBLIC SAFETY ARE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE. THEREFORE, THE INDEPENDENT COMMUNITY POLICE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION SEES THIS BUDGET AS A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE CITY TO LIVE UP TO ITS PROMISE TO REIMAGINE PUBLIC SAFETY BY ALSO FUNDING UNARMED RESPONSE PROGRAMS IN ANN ARBOR. NO MATTER WHAT YOU THINK OF THE PHRASE THE CITY IS IN A SITUATION WHERE THE POLICE HAVE QUITE LITERALLY VOLUNTEERED TO DEFUND THEMSELVES. SO THIS DEMONSTRATED WILLINGNESS BY THE POLICE TO WORK TOGETHER WITH THE CITY FOR THE SAKE OF THE WHOLE COMMUNITY, IS A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY FOR THE CITY TO TAKE THE POLICE DEPARTMENT'S GOOD FAITH AND SHOW THEM THAT INVESTMENTS IN POLICE ALTERNATIVES WILL BENEFIT THEM AS WELL. I WOULD BE REMISS NOT TO MENTION THAT THERE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSIONS WITHIN THE CITY OF ALLOCATES $234,000 OF SURPLUS FUNDING THAT THE ANN ARBOR HOUSING COMMISSION ALLOCATED FROM THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH MILLAGE TO A NOT AS YET DETERMINED PILOT PROGRAM AND I'M APPRECIATIVE OF THE CITY'S MINDFULNESS IN THINKING ABOUT ALTERNATIVES, HOWEVER THAT AMOUNT OF MONEY WOULD NOT COME ANYWHERE CLOSE TO PROVIDING UNARMED CRISIS SERVICE RESPONSE SERVICES TO OUR COMMUNITY FOR 24 HOURS A DAY, SEVEN DAYS A WEEK AND ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE CURRENTLY HAVE POLICE RESPONDING TO MENTAL HEALTH CALLS IS THAT THEY ARE THE ONLY DEPARTMENT OPEN AND AVAILABLE 24/7. SO SUCH AN UNARARMED CRISIS RESPONSE TEAM WOULD NEED TO BE AVAILABLE ALL THE TIME. $234 WOULD PROBABLY BE ONLY ENOUGH TO HIRE 2.5 UNARMED RESPONSE PROFESSIONALS. EVEN IF THEY ARE PERFECTLY SPLIT INTO THREE EIGHT-HOUR SHIFTS AND NEVER, EVER TOOK A TAKE OFF, WE WOULD ONLY EVER HAVE ONE PERSON ON DUTY AT A TIME. ONE PERSON ON CALL FOR A COMMUNITY OF WELL OVER 100,000 PEOPLE. EVEN IF IT WERE SUPPLEMENTED BY FEDERAL GRANTS, OUR IMAGINATION FOR WHAT POLICING COULD LOOK WHAT THE IS ALLOWED BY A FEMORAL GOVERNMENT GRANT. WE NEED TO COMMIT OURSELVES TO THE PROJECT OF BETTER PUBLIC SAFETY IN THE SAME WAY THAT WE HAVE COMMITTED OURSELVES TOWARDS MEETING ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS. IT SHOULD ALSO BE RECOGNIZED THAT THIS IMAGINATION IS NOT SOME IDEA THAT ICPOC HAS THOUGHT OF ON ITS OWN. ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY YOUTH SERVICES AGENCIES AND TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITIES AND HOSPITALS AND OTHER HEALTHCARE AGENCIES, HOUSING AGENCIES AND MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS ALL SUPPORT UNARMED RESPONSE PROGRAMS. AND PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY, IT'S ON US AS PUBLIC SERVANTS TO DARE TO IMAGINE IN THIS WAY BECAUSE IT AFFECTS EVERYONE IN OUR COMMUNITY. A LOT OF TIMES WHEN WE TALK ABOUT POLICE REFORM IN THIS COUNTRY, WE ALMT ALWAYS DO SO IN THE CONTEXT OF BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE AND THOSE WHO SUFFER FROM PSYCHOLOGICAL ISSUE AND A LOT OF TIMES IT IS THOSE POPULATIONS WHO DO THE BULK OF WORK WHEN IT COMES TO ADVOCATING FOR CHANGE. HOWEVER, THIS IS NOT JUST PEOPLE OF COLOR WHO ARE AFFECTED. IT'S OUR VETERANS AND ACTIVE DUTY SERVICE MEMBERS WHO ARE 1.4 TIMES AS LIKELY TO BE KILLED BY A COP THAN THEIR CIVILIAN COUNTERPARTS. IT'S OUR UNDOCUMENTED NGHBORS WHO ARE AFRAID TO GO TO THE POLICE FOR HELP. THE UNHOUSED PEOPLE, WHO ARE TOLD TO STOP LOITERING, THAT REALLY HAVE NOWHERE TO GO. SPECTRUM, WHO ARE TERRIFIED WHEN THEY DRIVE THAT THEY WILL GET PULLED OVER AND AN OFFICER MAY NOT UNDERSTAND THEIR SENSORY SENSITIVITIES. WOMEN WHO THINK THEIR SEXUAL TAKEN SERIOUSLY.NS WHO WON'T BE KILLINGS ARE THE SIXTH LEADINGE CAUSE OF DEATH BUT ARE LEAST TALKED ABOUT. TRANS FOLKS WHO HAVE TO WOR ABOUT PUT IN HOLDING FOR WHAT IT SAYSN THEIR LICENSE BUT NOT WHAT IS TRUE IN THEIR HEART. WHETHER OR NOT HAVE YOU BEEN TRADITIONALLY INCLUDED IN THESE CONVERSATIONS, THIS AFFECTS YOU. WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WITH THIS BUDGET. I HIGHLY ENCOURAGE THIS BODY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS UNDERSTANDING WHEN IT COMES TIME TO DETERMINE HOW THE MONEY GS ALLOCATED. THANK YOU.
00:10:15.862: >> Mayor Tayr: THANK YOU. WE NOW COME TO PUBLIC COMMENT RESERVE TIME. AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MEMBERS OFS THE PUBLICO SPEAK TO COUNCIL AND THE COMNITY ABOUT MATTERS OF MUNICIPAL INTEREST T SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT RESERVE TIM ONE NEE TO HAVE SIGNEDP IN ADVANC BY CONTACTIN OUR CITY CLERK.

OUR CLERK WILL NOTIFY YOU WHEN 30 SECONDS ARE REMAINING AND WHEN YOUR TIME HAS EXPIRED. WHEN YOUR TIME HAS EXPIRED, PLEASE CONCLUDE YOUR REMARKS AND CEDE THE FLOOR. OUR FIRST SPEAKER IS TRISCHE DUCKWORTH.
00:11:40.914: >> GOOD EVENING, COUNCIL, MAYOR TAYLOR AND ALL THE CITIZENS OF ANN ARBOR AND EVERYBODY THAT IS LISTENING. MY NAME IS TRISCHE DUCKWORTH FROM SURVIVORS SPEAK. WE ARE SPEAKING TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THE UNARMED CRISIS RESPONDERS. THERE IS SUCH A HUGE NEED FOR THIS IN OUR COMMUNITY. AS WE CAN SEE ACROSS THE COUNTRY, WHAT HAS HAPPENED WHEN PEOPLE RESPOND AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. RIGHT HERE IN THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR, WITH THE DEATH OF RASTER, WE HAVE SEEN WHAT HAPPENED, AND THE DEVASTATION AND THE CHILDREN THAT ARE WITHOUT THEIR MOTHER AND THE FAMILY THAT IS WITHOUT THEIR FAMILY MEMBER, ALL BECAUSE WE DO NOT HAVE UNARMED CRISIS RESPONDERS. JENNIFER HALL LAID OUT A BLUEPRINT WITH A SMALL BUDGET THAT WE KNOW AS DR. JACKSON SAID IS NOT ENOUGH TO SUSTAIN THIS KIND OF PROGRAMMING, BUT WE KNOW THAT THIS PROGRAMMING IS NECESSARY. SO WE'RE ASKING COUNCIL TO DO WHAT IS NECESSARY TO FIND THE FUNDING FOR THIS PROGRAM. SO THAT THE COMMUNITY COULD BE SAFER SO THAT PEOPLE OF COLOR COULD BE SAFER SO THAT PEOPLE THAT LIVE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS CAN BE SAFER. WE'RE COMING TO YOU ON BEHALF OF BLACK AND BROWN CITIZENS AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT MOST TIMES, IT'S VOICES OF PRIVILEGE THAT ARE LISTENED TO. BUT WE ARE ASKING YOU TO LISTEN TO THE VOICES OF THE COMMUNITY THAT ARE CRYING OUT ON BEHALF OF ARI RASSTE RS AND THOSE WHO COULD BE PUT IN ARM'S WAY IF YOU SEND ARMED OFFICERS IN CRISIS SITUATIONS. WE ARE ASKING THIS COUNCIL AND MAYOR TAYLOR TO DO WHAT IS RIGHT IN THIS AREA. AGAIN, THE CHILDREN DO THIS ON BEHALF OF THEM. THE FAMILY OF ARIRASTER. DO THIS FOR THEM! YOU SIT IN THE SEATS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PEOPLE ARE PROTECTED.
00:14:16.002: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
00:14:17.637: >> AND FIND THE FUNDING -- FIND THE FUNDING. TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN. THANK YOU. I YIELD THE REST OF MY TIME.
00:14:27.447: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS LORI SAGINAW.
00:14:49.636: >> Clerk Beaudry: MAYOR, I DO NOT SEE MS. SAGINAW ON THE CALL.
00:14:54.908: >> Mayor Taylor: MS. SAGINAW, IF YOU ARE LISTENING, PLEASE HIT STAR LINE TO RAISE YOUR HAND. MS. BEAUDRY.
00:15:41.488: >> Clerk Beaudry: I DO NOT SEE THE CALLER ON THE LINE.
00:15:43.790: >> Mayor Taylor: WE DO HAVE SOMEONE WHO RAISED THEIR HAND.
00:15:46.226: >> CAN YOU HEAR ME?
00:15:49.462: >> Clerk Beaudry: YES, IS THIS LORI SAGINAW.
00:15:51.965: >> NO, BUT I'M THE ONE WHO RAISED MY HAND. I'M JUST WAITING FOR MY TURN.
00:15:57.570: >> Mayor Taylor: MY APOLOGIES. IT'S LORI SAGINAW'S TURN. WE CALL PEOPLE IN THE ORDER OF THE AGENDA, SIR. IF LORI SAGINAW IS NOT HERE --
00:16:12.652: >> Clerk Beaudry: OH, MAYOR, I MAY HAVE HER NOW.
00:16:15.288: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
00:16:17.524: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER 551, IS THIS LORI SAGINAW? CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING IN 551? YOU CAN PRESS STAR SIX TO UNMUTE YOUR PHONE.
00:16:40.880: >> OKAY. AAM I UNMUTED NOW.
00:16:47.787: >> LORI SAGINAW IS NOT HERE.
00:16:50.623: >> Clerk Beaudry: OH, -- MAYOR, I MAY HAVE HER NOW.
00:16:53.893: >> THANK YOU.
00:16:57.730: >> Mayor Taylor: MS. SAGINAW, SO YOU CAN TURN OFF YOUR TELEVISION OR THE COMPUTER --
00:17:03.069: >> WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO TURN OFF?
00:17:07.407: >> Mayor Taylor: WE CAN HEAR OURSELVES THROUGH --
00:17:09.209: >> OKAY HOW IS THAT? IS THAT BETTER?
00:17:11.978: >> Mayor Taylor: IT IS. THANK YOU.
00:17:13.813: >> OKAY. ALL RIGHT. GREAT. I HAVEN'T DONE THIS THIS WAY BEFORE. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS ALL OF YOU TONIGHT. AND I WANT TO COMMEND THE CITY, MY CITY, FOR THIS GOAL TO RE-ENVISION PUBLIC SAFETY AND THE COMMITMENT TO DO THAT BECAUSE IT IS HAPPENING ACROSS THE NATION, AND I -- I LOVE THE IDEA THAT WE CAN BE ON THE FRONTIER OF THIS. SO AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED TONIGHT, I WANT TO SUPPORT ALL OF OUR EFFORTS TO INCREASE OUR ABILITY TO RESPOND TO COMMUNITY NEED, WITH UNARMED RESPONDERS. AND I WANT TO APPRECIATE OUR VERY OWN POLICE DEPARTMENT, FOR RAISING THE POSSIBILITY OF OFFERING SOME OF ITS MONIES TO INITIATE THIS CHANGE. WE'RE ALL SMART FOLKS. WE KNOW THAT SO MANY SITUATIONS ARE BETTER HANDLED BY UNARMED RESPONDERS, WHO ARE TRAINING IN TRAUMA AND DEESCALATION. I THINK THAT IF WE CAN TAKE THE FIRST STEPS TO DO IT, IT WOULD BE A HUGE POSITIVE IMPACT ON OUR COMMUNITY OVERALL. WE KNOW THAT DATA SHOWS THAT UNARMED RESPONDERS REDUCE THE NUMBER OF DEATHS AND THE POSSIBILITY OF IT, AND I FEEL THAT IF WE AIM HIGH AND REALLY WORK ON THIS TOGETHER, AS HAS BEEN REQUESTED, THAT WE CAN ACCOMPLISH THIS. I KNOW FIRSTHAND, FROM WORKING ON THE TASK FORCE SEVERAL YEARS AGO, HOW COMPLEX AND HOW MULTIFACETED THE CHALLENGES ARE THE POLICE OFFICERS FACE. AND AS MUCH AS THEY WOULD WISH TO, THERE IS NO WAY THAT THEY CAN FUNCTION AS MENTAL HEALTH EXPERTS, SOCIAL WORKERS OR DRUG COUNSELORS, YET IN SO MANY SITUATIONS THAT'  THAT'S EXACTLT IS EXPECTED OF THEM. SO SENDING OFFICERS ARMED WITH GUNS TO RESOL MUCH ISSUE -- RESOLVE ISSUES THAT DO NOT REQUIRE GUNS IS SOMETHING I URGE YOU TO THINK OF EVERY POSSIBLE WAY OF ENDING IN A -- IN A TIMELINE, IN A SEQUENCE, THAT THE COMMUNITY CAN KNOW AND UNDERSTAND. I FEEL WE OWE THIS TO OUR OFFICERS AND TO OUR COMMUNITY.
00:19:52.839: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
00:19:54.807: >> PLEASE CONSIDER WITH ALL OF YOUR CREATIVE THOUGHTS HOW TO MAXIMIZE THIS AMAZING OPPORTUNITY BEFORE US. THANK YOU.
00:20:05.852: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS DEVIN MAYER. CLERK CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING IN 323? YOU CAN PRESS STAR SIX TO UNMUTE YOUR PHONE.
00:20:23.336: >> HELLO, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
00:20:25.004: >> Mayor Taylor: YES, WE CAN.
00:20:26.339: >> GOOD EVENING, COUNCILMEMBERS AND MAYOR TAYLOR. MY NAME IS DEVIN MAYER. I'M A STUDENT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, AND ACTUALLY ON CAMPUS AND I'M ENROLLED IN THE MICHIGAN SCHOOL OF SOCIAL WORK PROGRAM. BEFORE I START I FEEL IT'S IMPORTANT TO ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE MY PRIVILEGE AND STATUS PRIOR TO SPEAKING BEFORE SUCH A HIGH STATUS AND ELITE GROUP SUCH AS YOURSELVES. I'M A WHITE MIDDLE-CLASS AFFLUENT MAIL WHO WAS BORN INTO HIGH PLACES OF PRIVILEGE. HOWEVER, I SEEK TO SUIT LISE MY MY -- UTILIZE MY PRIVILEGE TO INVOKE CHANGE FOR THOSE VOICES WHO HAVE BEEN SENCED. I'M HERE TO SPEAK ON SURVIVORS SPEAKS TO AMPLIFY THE VOICES WHO EXPERIENCED JUSTICE. I WANT TO SPEAK ABOUT THE REALLOCATION OF FUNDS AND THE NEW DISCRETIONARY BUDGET. I SPOKE TWO WEEKS AGO ABOUT HOW WE THE CITIZENS OF ANN ARBOR ARE WATCHING WHERE OUR MONEY IS GOING. WE STRONGLY HOPE THAT OUR VOICES WILL BE CONSIDERED IN SUCH MATTERS OF MONEY ALLOCATION, ESPECIALLYROM THE TAXPAYER DOLLARS. FOR SO MY FACES FOR THE FUNDS TO BE REALLOCATED TO. WE HAVE SEEN THAT THERE'S A LARGE PUSH FOR GREEN CARBON INITIATIVE IN THE CITY WITH A $3.6 MILON BUDGET REQUEST. WHILE I DO THINK TT THIS IS IMPORTANT, I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO POINT OUT HOW VITAL IT IS TO PUT THE MONEY BACK INTO PROTECTING OUR CITENS. SPECIFICALLY, I'M SPEAKING ABOUT TTING THAT MONEY TOWARDS AN CITIZENS LIVING FOR MENTALAM FOR HEALTH ISSUE, A TYPE OF TASK FOE THAT WOULD HAVE POTENTIALLY BEEN ABLE TO SE SOMEONE LIKE AU ROSSER. AN UNARMED CRISIS TAS FORCE CAN SAVE UNARMED CITIZENS. DENVER, THEY HAVE REACHED AMAZING RESULTS ALREADY. THEIR SUPPORT TEAM ASSISTANCE RESPONSE OR S.T.A.R.s WAS CALLED TO MORE THAN 700 911 CALLS. IT RESULTED IN TO ARRESTS AND NO POLICE BACKUP. NOT ONLY WOULD IT SAVE CITIZEN LIVES BUT POLICE LIVES AS WELL. THERE'S A DECREASE OF 3% PRELIMINARILY IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS TO POLICEALLS ALLOWING THEM TO BE MORE AVAILABLE FOR FASTER, MOREMMINENT SOLUTIONS. I HAVEEEN IN ONE OF THE PROTESTS EARLIER THIS SUMMERN THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR, THERE WAS THE VION. OTESTS SUPPORTIN THE SAME BLACK LIVES MTER MOVEMENT HAD A WEDGE DRIVEN THROUGH THEM, DUE TO THEURORAA ROSSER SHOOTIN THAT RULEDN A LAC OF TRUST IN THE POLIC
00:22:58.991: >> Cle Beaudry: 30ECONDS. THVITAL MONEY COULD SAVE LIVES, RESOURC AND HELPEND A PUTTING MEY TOWAR THE CRISY. RESPONSEEAM COULD HELPOEND THE RACIAL DIVID IN THE CITY OF ANN ARBO AND WORK TOWARDS THE UNIED CIT IFOURU WANT TO SHOW YOU NT TO ADDSS SOME OF THE RACIALNEQUY PBLEM THA BROTHERS AND SISRS, THE WE PE YOU TE T SUGGEIO T HEAR THANOU VERY MUCH.
00:23:23.850: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS MICHELLE HUGHES.
00:23:38.798: >> Clerk Beaudry: MAYOR, I DON'T SEE MICHELLE HUGHES ON THE CALL.
00:23:56.115: >> Mayor Taylor: WE DO HAVE SOMEONE WITH THEIR HAND RAISED. IS THAT A DIFFERENT CALLER?
00:24:01.921: >> Clerk Beaudry: THAT'S NOT THE NUMBER, BUT I CAN CHECK. HI, IS THIS MICHELLE HUGHES?
00:24:06.726: >> YOU ARE UNMUTED.
00:24:08.694: >> YES, THIS IS MICHELLE HUGHES, SORRY. SO SURPRISINGLY, I'M NOT HERE TO TALK ABOUT DC-5, THE SIDEWALK SNOW REMOVAL PROPOSAL. IT'S A STRONG PROPOSAL VETTED BY THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION, AND I TRUST YOU TO PASS IT. THE BUDGET IS STILL BEING CONSIDERED AND THIS IS THE PERFECT TIME TO REDUCE THE POLICE'S BUDGET AND DIRECT THAT MONEY TO A NEW PROGRAM OF UNARMED MENTAL CRISIS RESPONSE. THIS YEAR, ALL THE DEPARTMENTS HAVE BEEN ASKED TO REDUCE THEIR BUDGETS BY 5%. IF HE FEBRUARY 8th COUNCIL WORK STUDY SESSION, THEY PROPOSED $1.3 MILLION. IT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT BUT THAT'S ONLY A 4.25% REDUCTION FROM THEIR LAST YEAR'S ALLOCATION OF $31 MILLION. WE SHOULD ASK THEM TO AT LEAST CARRY THEIR WEIGHT AS ALL DEPARTMENTS HAVE BEEN ASKED TO DO. BUT YOU HAVE HEARD ME TALK ABOUT DEFUNDING THE POLICE, DEFUNDING THE POLICE IS NOT ABOUT CUTTING THEIR BU BUDGET TO MAKE UP FOR A BUDGET SHORTFALL BUT TO INVEST THAT IN OTHER PROGRAMS, PROGRAMS LIKE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND MENTAL HEALTHCARE. AN EXCITING PILOT PROGRAM HAS BEEN PROPOSED BY THE ANN ARBOR HOUSING COMMISSION AT THE COUNCIL WORK SESSION OF FEBRUARL HEALTH CARE WORKERS WHO CAN RESPOND TO APPROPRIATE CALLS RATHER THAN THE POLICE. BUT THEY WERE ONLY ABLE TO GET $232,000 TO FUND THE EFFORT, NOT NEARLY ENOUGH. AT THAT MEETING, SEVERAL COUNCILMEMBERS EXPRESSED THE IDEA OF FINDING ADDITIONAL SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR THE PROGRAM. CUT THE POLICE BUDGET AT LEAST BY THE 5% THAT OTHER DEPARTMENTS HAVE BEEN ASKED. USE THAT MONEY TO FUND THE EFFORT. AND THAT WAS THE OFFICE OF SUSTAINABILITY, FOR THEIR WORK IN BEING CARBON NEUTRAL. WE DON'T LOOK TO FUNDING THERE. THE CITY COUNCIL DECLARED A CLIMATE EMERGENCY. WE NEED THAT FUNDING TO ADDRESS THE EMERGENCY. BUT IN JULY, THE COUNCIL DECLARED RACISM A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS, BUT MADE NO PROMISES TO ACTUALLY ADDRESS THE CRISIS. NO FUNDING WAS OFFERED AND NO STAFF WAS HIRED. MAKE NOSE PROMISES. HIRE THAT STAFF. CREATE A RACIAL EQUITY OFFICE, LIKE THE COUNTY DID. THE CITY WENT TO A LOT OF EFFORT TO CREATE THE A2ZERO PLAN. WE NEED AN EFFORT LIKE THAT FOR PUBLIC SAFETY. IN JUNE, COUNCIL CONSIDERED A RESOLUTION ASKING THE POLICE OVERSITE COMMITTEE. THEY HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO RESPOND BECAUSE THEY ARE OVERWHELMED WITH THEIR NORMAL WORK AND INSUFFICIENTLY FUNDED.
00:26:46.652: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
00:26:47.720: >> THE POLICE TASK FORCE RECOMMENDED THAT THEY HAVE $300,000 A YEAR. THAT'S WHAT THEY NEED TO DO THAT WORK. DO AT LEAST THAT. DO THAT IN THIS BUDGET. FIND THAT MONEY BY REDUCING THE POLICE'S BUDGET. SHOW US THAT YOU ARE SERIOUS ABOUT DOING THE WORK THAT IT WOULD TAKE TO FOSTER REAL PUBLIC SAFETY FOR ALL OF ANN ARBOR'S RESIDENTS. THANK YOU.
00:27:06.405: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS CORY HOLLAND.
00:27:16.382: >> Clerk Beaudry: THIS MIGHT BE HIM. IS THIS CORY HOLLAND.
00:27:27.960: >> YES, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
00:27:29.261: >> Mayor Taylor: YES, WE CAN, THANK YOU.
00:27:33.432: >> I JUST WANT TO BE BRIEF. I SPOKE THE LAST COUNCIL MEETING, AND I WAS TALKING ABOUT THE SITUATION I HAVE IN ANN ARBOR COURTS AND THE SITUATION I HAVE BEEN GOING THROUGH. AND I HAVE BEEN LISTENING HERE FOR THE PAST FEW MINUTES. I HEAR PEOPLE QUOTING NUMBERS, STATS AND UNARMED RESISTANCE. THAT SOUNDS REALLY GOOD IN THEORY. IT DOESN'T WORK. IN MY SITUATION, I'M LITERALLY IN THE SITUATION I AM AND I WAS SITTING AT HOME LAYING ON MY COUCH. SO IF THE SYSTEM DOESN'T WORK, IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOU PUT IN THE SYSTEM. THE SYSTEM ITSELF HAS TO WORK. IN ORDER FOR THAT SYSTEM TO WORK, PEOPLE LIKE COLOR, LIKE THE PEOPLE WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT, THEY HAVE TO BE GIVEN SOME TYPE OF RIGHTS. DEMOCRACY CAN'T WORK IF IT ONLY WORKS FOR A CHOSEN F FEW AND OTR ONES ARE LEFT OUT. I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR MR. HAYNER FOR SPEAKING OUT LAST TIME ABOUT MY INJUSTICE. INSTEAD OF REPEATING WHAT I REPEATED LAST TIME. I WANTED TO POINT OUT TO YOU HOW HORRIFIC THIS STORY BECOMES. I HAVEN'T SEEN MY CHILDREN IN FIVE YEARS FOR SIMPLY ONE REASON, I WANT JUSTICE FOR THE PEOPLE WHO HARMED ME. THAT'S IT. YOU WILL FIND NO WRONGDOING ON MY PART OTHER THAN THAT. MY WHOLE SITUATION STARTED SLEEPING ON THE COUCH IN MY HOUSE, TWO WHITE WOMEN WHO HAD MY CHILDREN. SOMETHING HAPPENED TO THE CHILDREN, AND THEY TOOK ONE OF THE CHILDREN TO THE HOSPITAL, LIED, TO THE HOSPITAL AND TOLD THEM I DID IT AND THEN THEY DISAPPEARED. THEN WHEN THEY CAUGHT BY C.P.S., WHEN C.P.S. CAUGHT UP WITH THEM, THEY HAD ANOTHER LIE READY FOR THEM. WHY ARE YOU RUNNING FROM THE TOWN YOU JUST CAME FROM? OH, THAT SAME BLACK GUY WE BLAMED FOR HURTING A CHILD, HE'S THE REASON WHY WE ARE RUNNING BECAUSE WE ARE AFRAID OF HIM. SO THEY HAD THIS LIE CONSTANTLY GOING ON AND ON AND ON. WHERE YOU HAVE A SITUATION WHERE A SYSTEM -- IF ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS FIND A SCAPEGOAT, WHO COMES FROM A MARGINALIZED COMMUNITY, AND YOU GET OF ALL THE TROUBLE THAT YOU CAUSED THEN IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT NUMBERS YOU QUOTE. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT K OF SYSTEMS YOU PUT IN PLACE. AS LONG AS THAT RACIAL, LIES, THREATS FROM A WHITE P PERSON OF PRIVILEGE CAN DESTROY A PERSON OF COLOR'S LIFE THAT EASY AND YOU AIN'T DONE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AT ALL, THEN IT DON'T MATTER WHAT PROGRAM YOU HAVE. I'M ONLY BRINGING THESE PROBLEMS UP RIGHT NOW BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND THE TWO CHILDREN I HAVE, THEY ARE SMALL.
00:30:02.281: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
00:30:03.048: >> THEY ARE 8 AND 11. I HAVEN'T SEEN THEM SINCE THEY WERE 2 AND 5, BUT I KNOW IF I DON'T STAND HERE AND FIGHT FOR THIS RIGHT NOW, THEY ARE GOING TO BE FACING THE SAME PROBLEMS THAT THEIR FATHER IS FACING AND I HAVE DONE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AT ALL WRONG. YOU ONLY HAVE TO ANSWER TWO QUESTIONS. YOU DON'T GET TO KNOW ME. I WILL BE DOWN THERE SOON. I'M DISABLED. SO I CAN'T DO AS MUCH. YOU CAN ANSWER TWO QUESTIONS. DO YOU BELIEVE IN THE RULE OF LAW? AND DO YOU BELIEVE THAT RACISM IS WRONG? BECAUSE IF YOU CAN ANSWER BOTH OF THOSE QUESTIONS AND SAY, YES, THEN MY CASE IS SIMPLE. BUT IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE WHEN YOU GOT TO DO IT TO YOUR OWN COMMUNITY. I JUST ASK ALL THE PEOPLE OUT HERE, QUOTING ALL EVER THESE --
00:30:47.026: >> Clerk Beaudry: TIME.
00:30:47.559: >> PLEASE. REALITY. IT'S MORE THAN JUST STATS. THANK YOU, MA'AM.
00:30:51.964: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS DAN BILL ITCH. -- DAN BILLICH.
00:31:09.982: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING IN 78, 2DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT?
00:31:14.720: >> CAN YOU ALL HEAR ME?
00:31:19.091: >> Mayor Taylor: YES, WE CAN.
00:31:21.894: >> HELLO. HELLO, MAYOR AND COUNCIL, FELLOW CITIZENS, MY NAME IS DAN BILLICH AND I LIVE AT 2719 CRANBROOK ROAD, WHICH IS NEAR BUT NOT ABUTTING 2857 PACKARD, THE PARCEL THAT WE ARE DISCUSSING TONIGHT. TO BEGIN, I WANT TO THANK COUNCILMEMBERS RADINA, GRAND, AND GRISWOLD FOR BRINGING THIS RESOLUTION FORWARD. LAST YEAR, WE HAD A PROPOSAL FOR A PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT AT 2857 PACKARD ROAD THAT I PUBLICLY OPPOSED. FORTUNATELY THAT, DEVELOPMENT DIDN'T GET BUILT. NOW WE HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE. THE CANOPY PROPOSED BY FRY COLLABORATIVE. THAT WOULD PRESERVE AND BUILD UPON THAT LAND IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH THE AMBITIOUS VISION ANN ARBOR HAS FOR ITSELF. THE CANOPY PROPOSAL IS OBVIOUSLY BETTER THAN THE REAL ESTATE STRIP MINING CURRENTLY ENSHRINED IN THE CONSENT JUDGMENT. IT'S ALSO BETTER THAN ANYTHING FROM A FOR-PROFIT DEVELOPER. THE CURRENT RESOLUTION BEFORE COUNCIL IS SIMPLY A MATTER OF ASKING OUR LEGAL AND PLANNING PROS WHETHER IT'S LEGALLY POSSIBLE FOR US TO DO THE RIGHT THING AT 2857 PACKARD. OF COURSE, WE SHOULD WANT TO FIND OUT WHETHER WE HAVE THE OPTION TO DO THE RIGHT THING. WHAT IS AT STAKE IS THE ABILITY TO CONTROL OUR OWN DESTINY. I'M PRETTY SURE THAT THE CITY WANTS THAT PROPOSED BY THRIVE COLLABORATIVE. I'M PRETTY SURE THEY DON'T WANT TO BE BULLIED INTO THE CURRENT CONSENT JUDGMENT. THIS RESOLUTION BEFORE YOU PERMITS COUNCIL TO ASK OUR CITY EMPLOYEES WHETHER WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE OURSELVES AND DETERMINE OUR OWN FUTURE. TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE. PLEASE VOTE YES ON THE RESOLUTION BEFORE YOU AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
00:33:24.883: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS ANNE BANNISTER.
00:33:35.360: >> Clerk Beaudry: MS. BANNISTER. YOU CAN UNMUTE YOURSELF AND SPEAK. MS. BANNISTER, IF YOU PRESS STAR SIX, YOU CAN UNMUTE YOURSELF.
00:34:02.888: >> GOOD EVENING, COUNCILMEMBERS, I'M HERE TO SPEAK ON DC-2, THE RESOLUTION ABOUT 2857 PACKARD, ALSO KNOWN AS THE WEBER PROPERTY AND BECOMING KNOWN AS THE CANOPY. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK ALSO COUNCILMEMBER RADINA AND COUNCILMEMBER GRAND ANACRUSES WALD FOR COSPONSOR -- AND GRISWOLD FOR COSPONSORING. WE HAVE A TREMENDOUSPPORTUNITY BEFORE COUNCILHIS EVENING TO HAVE A SECON CHANCE TO REOPEN THE CONSENT JUDGMENT ON THIS PROPERTY AND INSTEAD OF THE 51 TOWNHOME SUBDIVISION PLAN UNDER THE R1E ZONING, WE N INSTEAD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE AS MANY HOUSING UNITS AND POTENTIALLY SAVE THE TREES AND PROVIDE AN ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABL HOUSING OPTION AND ALSO PSERVE THE HISTORIC COLLINS HOUSE ON THEROPERTY. I'M REFERNG T MATT GROCO ANDHRIVE COLLEIVE PLAN CALLED THE COPYHAT CAN BE A MOL FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT IN TH CITY. IT PVIDES MOREOUSING WHOUT IMPACTING T NATAL SYSTE AND THERAINAGE SYSMS THAT HA BEEN TAKIN SH A BEATING INHIS AREA IN RECENT YEARS FR OTHER GROWTH PREURES. THEANOPY, AS I SAI HAS A MILARIZE OF 51 TO 70 APARENTSR CDO OR A M O TH. THAN -- HOUSE MORE PEOPLE THAN THE TOWNHOME SUBDIVISION AND IT WOULD BE 55 FEET TALL AND NESTLED IN AMONGST THE TREE CANOPY AND UNDERNEATH IT. IT WOULD HAVE SIMILAR FEATURES TO THE VERIDIAN PLAN OVER AT COUNTY FARM PARK AND THAT IT COULD BE ALL ELECTRIC, SOLAR POWERED AND NET ZERO AND ECO FRIENDLY AND LEAVE OVER 5 ACRES OF HERITAGE AND LANDMARK OAK, WALNUT AND HICKORY TREES. AND BEST OF ALL, IF WE ARE ABLE TO MAKE A DEAL WITH A THRIVE COLLABORATIVE, THEY WILL PAY FAIR MARKET VALUE OF ROUGHLY $1 MILLION AND BRING THAT TO THE TABLE FOR THE FINANCIAL -- TO FINANCIALLY HELP THE CITY PRESERVE THIS LAND. SO WE WOULD GET AN ESTIMATED $1 MILLION BY COLLABORATING WITH MATT GROCOFF AND THRIVE LABTIVE.
00:36:43.248: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
00:36:44.483: >> SO MY KEY POINTS ARE, PLEASE PUT A DATE CERTAIN ON THE RESOLUTION TONIGHT. I SUGGEST MAY #  15 IF POSSIBLE BECAUSE STAFF HAS BEEN STUDYING THIS FOR YEARS. AND ALSO, PREPARE A LETTER OF INTENT OR PURCHASE AGREEMENT FOR THE OWNER BOB WEBER. AND LOOK INTO THE SOURCES OF FUNDING, INCLUDING THE $5.5 MILLION IN THE PARKLAND ACQUISITION FUND. THANK YOU.
00:37:18.884: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS MATT GROCOFF.
00:37:27.659: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING IN 877, YOU CAN PRESS STAR SIX TO UNMUTE YOURSELF.
00:37:39.004: >> HEY THERE. CAN Y'ALL HEAR ME OKAY?
00:37:41.940: >> Mayor Taylor: YES, WE CAN.
00:37:42.574: >> THANK YOU, MAYOR TAYLOR AND SO MY NAME IS MATTHEW GROCOFF. I'M ONE OF THE PARTNERS IN THE THRIVE CANOPY AND THE LIVING COMMUNITIES PROJECT AND VERIDIAN, IN COLLABORATION WITH EVELYN HOUSING. I REALLY AGAIN WANT TO GIVE A REALLY SPECIAL THANKS TO COUNCILMCOUNCILMEMBER RADINA AND AND GRISWOLD FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS -- ON THIS RESOLUTION. AT THRIVE COLLABORATIVE, WE HAVE A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO DEVELOPMENT. WE BELIEVE IN A THREE-FOLD APPROACH TO DEVELOPMENT THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE, FRANKLY BECOME LAW. WE NEED TO MAKE THESE CODE. NUMBER ONE IS THAT WE NEED TO STOP -- AND THIS IS NOT JUST IN ANN ARBOR, BUT GLOBALLY, WE NEED TO STOP BUILDING ON GREENFIELD SITES. FULL STOP. WE DEVELOPED ENOUGH OF THE PLANET AND THERE'S ENOUGH PLACES THAT WE NEED TO BUILD ON -- OR THAT WE CAN BUILD ON TO INCREASE DENSITY AND EVERYTHING ELSE. AND NUMBER TWO, WE NEED TO BUILD THE MUCH-NEEDED HOUSING BUT ONLY ON PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED LANDS. AND THEN THE THIRD PART OF THAT, THAT WE CAN BEGIN RIGHT AWAY AS WELL IS TO BEGIN ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION AND LIFE BACK TO THE EXISTING BUILT ENVIRONMENT THAT. INCLUDES EVEN THE ALLEYWAYS OF DOWNTOWN ANN ARBOR. FINDINGEVERY NICHE, EVERY REFUGEE THAT WE CAN FIND TO BRING LIFE BACK INTO OUR HUMAN BUILT ENVIRONMENT. BUT REALLY IMPORTANTLY TO AVOID THE CATASTROPHIC CONSEQUENCES OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND TO CREATE THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT SOLUTIONS THAT WE NEED, RATHER THAN FOCUSING ON WHAT IS POLITICALLY POSSIBLE, WE NEED TO FOCUS ON WHAT IS TECHNICALLY NECESSARY. SO BY FOCUSING WHAT WE NEED TO DO, BUT WHAT WE MUST DO, THEN WE CAN TURN OUR ATTENTION TO ASK THE VERY SIMPLE QUESTION, HOW DO WE COLLABORATE TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE? SO I HOPE THAT THIS COLLABORATION AS A COMMUNITY ON 2857 PACKARD TO TURN A CASE STUDY OF ZERO SUM -- I LOVE ONE OF THE PREVIOUS CALLERS CALLED IT A DEVELOPMENT STRIP MINE.
00:40:05.350: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
00:40:06.651: >> AND WE CAN TURN THAT INTO A DEVELOPMENT THAT'S SOCIALLY JUST, CULTURALLY RICH AND ECOLOGICAL RESTORATIVE. AND FOR THOSE OF Y'ALL WHO WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE PROJECT, GO TO THRIVE-COLLABORATIVE.COM AND YOU CAN EMAIL ME THERE TOO, AND WE'RE HAPPY TO SET UP LITTLE ZOOM CALLS TO TALK AND HAVE EVERYONE LEARN ABOUT THE PROJECT. SO THANK YOU VERY, VERY MUCH.
00:40:30.509: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS MAYA SHH GNAW. -- MAYA SCHNAU.
00:40:46.358: >> Clerk Beaudry: MAYOR, I DON'T SEE THIS CALLER ON THE LINE.
00:40:53.365: >> Mayor Taylor: MS. SCHNAU, IF YOU ARE ON THE LINE, PLEASE ENTER STAR NINE NOW.
00:41:05.176: >> Clerk Beaudry: STAR NINE.
00:41:23.361: >> Mayor Taylor: WE'LL PICK HER UP ON THE FLIP SIDE IF SHE'S AVAILABLE. OUR NEXT CALLER IS LISA BRUSH.
00:41:29.134: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING 483.
00:41:32.938: >> HELLO, ALL. EVERY TIME I COME BEFORE YOU TO TALK, I'M ALWAYS STRUCK BY THE ENORMITY OF WHAT YOU ALL DO EVERY DAY. SO I THANK YOU FOR THAT AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE CREATIVITY AND THINKING ABOUT RETHINKING PUBLIC SAFETY AND AT THE MOMENT, I WANT TO PUT ON MY SNOW BUNNY HAT AND SHARE WITH YOU THE TRANSFORMATIVE NATURE OF WORK THAT I HAVE BEEN DOING FOR THE LAST SEVEN YEARS WITH THE.
00:42:00.532: >> HE ABOUT BUDDY PROJECT. IN THINKING ABOUT SIDEWALKS AS PEDESTRIAN TRANSPORTATION CORRIDORS THAT SHOULD BE MAINTAINED IN THEIR ENTIRETY, AND IT'S BEEN A PHENOMENAL JOURNEY. SO I HAVE HEARD THERE'S BEEN -- SO WE PUT OUT THE REPORT AND YOU ALL HAVE THE HARD COPY ROADMAP AND THE ELECTRONIC ROADMAP IN YOUR BOXES, AND WE HAVE SPENT A LOT OF TIME THINKING ABOUT THIS ISSUE AND HOW WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DELIVER A CITY-WIDE SOLUTION. AND WE HAVE BEEN INSIDE THE BOX. WE HAVE BEEN OUTSIDE THE BOX, WE HAVE BEEN TO VERMONT. WE HAVE BEEN TO OTHER CITIES THROUGHOUT THE -- THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF MICHIGAN. WE HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT JUST PUTTING IT ALL ON YOU ALL AND SAYING, HEY, CITY, THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD DO. BUT INSTEAD WE REALIZED THAT THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS THAT YOU ARE DEALING WITH, RETHINKING THE ENTIRE PUBLIC SAFETY SYSTEM WOULD BE ONE TO SPEND YOUR TIME ON AND INSTEAD, WE DECIDED THAT WE WOULD TAKE THIS GROUP OF PROFESSIONALS THAT CURTIS ALSO CALLED HEY, IT'S JUST A GROUP OF VOLUNTEERS, BUT KNOW THAT THIS GROUP OF PROFESSIONALS THAT HAVE BEEN INVOLVED WITH KNOW BUDDIES HAVE DECADES AND DECADES OF EXPERIENCE INSIDE THE CITY AND OUTSIDE THE CITY AND HELPING TO DELIVER SOLUTIONS TO YOU ALL TO MAKE YOUR JOB EASIER. SO I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT WE'RE HERE FOR YOU ALL AND WANT TO BE ABLE TO HELP PUSH ON THE SYSTEM WHERE WE CAN AND WHERE WE CAN'T. I ALSO WANT TO DESCRIBE THE TRANSFORMATIONAL NATURE OF HAVING CITY SIDEWALKS MAINTAINED IN THEIR ENTIRETY. SO WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE COMMISSION ON DISABILITY ISSUES AND THE CENTERS FOR INDEPENDENT LIVING AND ONE THE THINGS THAT THEY HAVE SAID IS IT'S BEEN PHENOMENAL TO HAVE THE VOICE OF THE COMMUNITY WITH DISABILITY ISSUES JUST REPRESENTED. LIKE, THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO FIGHT TO HAVE IT REPRESENTED. IT WAS JUST THERE BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT WITHOUT THEIR CITY SIDEWALKS MAINTAINED IN THEIR ENTIRETY, THEY ARE STUCK INSIDE THEIR HOME. SO, AGAIN, YOU ALL STARTED OFF PUBLIC COMMENT AND I GUESS I GOT TO BELIEVE THAT I'M COMING CLOSE TO THE END OF THE PUBLIC COMMENT BUT IT STARTED OUT ABOUT VOICE, RIGHT?
00:44:07.559: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
00:44:08.593: >> AND REPRESENTING EVERYBODY IN THIS. AND SO WE WANT TO SAY THAT WHEN WE MAINTAIN OUR CITY SIDEWALKS IN THEIR ENTIRETY AND WE CAN DO IT, WE HAVE SOME SOLUTIONS. WE ARE HERE TO HELP AND WE WANT TO PROVIDE WITH YOU SOLUTIONS. WE HAVE FUNDING MODELS, GOVERNANCE MODELS, DELIVERY MODELS THAT DON'T PUT THIS ON YOUR SHOULDERS AND YET WE ARE HERE TO JUST BE THERE WITH YOU ALONG THE WAY, AND HELP PROVIDE A SOLUTION THAT WE THINK CAN DELIVER SOMETHING TRANSFORMATIONAL TO OUR CITY. SO THANK YOU ALL.
00:44:39.090: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. IS MS. S SCHNAU WITH US? PLESS STAR NINE IF AWASH TO SPEAK.
00:44:55.406: >> Clerk Beaudry: I DO NOT SEE CALLER NINE ON THE PHONE OR ON THE CALL.
00:45:04.015: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. WE WILL MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT SPEAKER, OUR FIRST ALTERNATE, JAMES D'AMOUR.
00:45:16.628: >> Clerk Beaudry: MR. D'AMOUR, CALLER 411?
00:45:20.999: >> COUNCIL AND JESSE, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
00:45:23.501: >> Mayor Taylor: YES, WE CAN.
00:45:24.502: >> OH, VERY GOOD. GOOD EVENING MAYOR TAYLOR, MEMBERS OF COUNCIL, FOR THE SECOND TIME THIS WINTER, I FELT MOVED TO SPEAK BEFORE YOU WITH RESPECT TO A MATTER NEAR MY HOUSE. THIS CASE, THIS IS 2857 PACKARD. I HAVE SPOKEN BEFORE -- TO YOU BEFORE IN THE CAPACITY AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE SIERRA CLUB AND AS AN INDIVIDUAL OPPOSED TO THE PETER BUILDING PROJECT THAT WAS REJECTED BY THE LAPPING COMMISSION AND COUNCIL BY NEGATIVE IMPACTS BUT IT WAS FORCED TO AB PROVED BY THE CITY. WELL, JIM HEIST, HE MAY HAVE THE HISTORIC TREES REMOVED UNDER THE C.J. ANDHEY HAD CONCERNS OVER WATER ISSUES AND BASEMENTS WERE JUST SET ASIDE WITH THIS. BUT, FOR WHATEVER REASON, THIS DEVELOPE HAS CHOSEN NOT TO BUILD ON THIS SITE. T THE LANDOWNER DOES HE AN EXISTING LEGAL SITE PLAN THAT ULD BE TRANSFERRED TO ANY DEVELOPER WHO WISHES TO BUILD ATO GO THIS TERRIBLE SITE PLAN, BUT FOR ONCE, IT'S MY PLEASURE TO COME BORE YOU TO ACTUALLY SUPPORT POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITY FOR DEVELOPMENT. TONIGHT, COUNCIL AGENDA ITEM DC-2 GIVES THE CITY A CHANCE TO REOPEN THE CJ AND IN DOING SO PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY TO SAVE TH TREES AND POTENTIALLY PROVIDE ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE HOUSING ON THIS SITE, WHILE ALSO POTENTIALLY PRESERVING HISTORIC PROPERTY ON THE SITE AS WELL, AS PREVIOUS SPEAKERS INDICATED. I TOO WANT TO THANK COUNCILMEMBER RADINA FOR SPONSORING THIS AND WORKING WITH THE CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE TO EXPLORE MAKING OPPORTUNITIES FOR THIS TO HAPPEN AND GRAND AND GRISLD FOR COSPONSORING THIS. I WANT TO COMMENT ANNE BANNISTER FOR HER WORK AND HER PREVIOUS ROLE. MATT GROCOFF THRIVE COLLABORATIVE HAS PROVIDED A FANTASTIC CONCEPT DESIGN THAT FRANKLY I BELIEVE CAN BE A MODEL FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT IN THIS CITY, PROVIDING MORE HSING IN THE CY WITHOUT IMPACTING THE NATURAL SYSTEMS THAT QUITE FRANKLY HAVE TAKEN A BEATING IN RECENT YEARSITH GROWETTE PRESSURES UPON THE CITY AND THAT THE REASON WHY I APPRED BEFORE YOUO OPPOS THESE PROJECTS BECAU OF THE IMPAC THE CITS URB FORESYUY TO YOU PROJECTAS AOAL AND BUDGET TO INCREASE TREE BUDGET AS PART OF ZERO SUSTAINILITY. CE AGAIN, WE FURTHER THE GLS OF PRESEING MATE TREES.
00:47:49.314: >> Crk Beaudry: 30 SECON. UNDER  PLANIKE THRIVE'S, THESE TES CAN BE PROTECTED, CEPT T SAME THE UGLY DESIGN.

ONCE AGAIN THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER RADINA AND GRAND AND GRISWOLD FOR SPONSORING AND COSPONSORING THIS RESOLUTION. AND FOLKS THANK YOU FOR CONSIDERING MY REMARKS.
00:48:31.656: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. COMMUNICATIONS TODAY FROM COUNCIL? COUNCILMEMBER NELSON?
00:48:42.533: >> Councilmember Nelson: THANK YOU. I JUST WANTED TO ANNOUNCE THAT THERE'S A PROJECT IN CHURCHILL DOWNS THAT'S ACTUALLY ON THIS AGENDA TONIGHT AND THERE'S A ZOOM MEETING ON MARCH 4th FOR RESIDENTS TO GET MORE INFORMATION ABOUT IT. THIS IS ABOUT THE STORMWATER BASIN PROJECT AND POSTCARDS WERE SENT TO NEARBY NEIGHBORS. BUT IF YOU ARE INTERESTED TO GETTING THAT ZOOM LINK, I CAN SEND IT TO YOU. TODAY MARCH 1st WAS THE EFFECTIVE DATE FOR THE S.T.R. ORDINANCE THAT COUNCIL PASSED IN SEPTEMBER AND THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN THE EFFECTIVE DATE. THE CITY HAS SENT OUT THOUSANDS OF MAILINGS TO PROPERTY OWNERS TO IDENTIFY THEMSELVES AND FIND OUT HOW MANY HOUSING UNITS WOULD BE LOST TO LONG-TERM RESIDENTS IF WE WERE TO CRAFT EXCEPTIONS FOR THOSE THAT ARE IN VIOLATION OF THE ORDINANCE AS PASSED IN SEPTEMBER. THE PLANNING COMMISSION WILL BE TALKING ABOUT IT TOMORROW NIGHT FOR ANYONE WHO IS INTERESTED IN THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE. THANK YOU.
00:49:45.530: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
00:49:46.397: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, MAYOR TAYLOR. I WOULD LIKE TO LET THE COMMUNITY AND BODY KNOW THAT I HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH TOM CRAWFORD AND OTHERS WITH THE STREET CLOSURES THAT TOOK PLACE LAST YEAR. WE HAVE MET A COUPLE OF TIMES THIS YEAR AND I'M HOPEFUL THAT STAFF WILL BE BRINGING FORWARD A RESOLUTION AT OUR NEXT MEETING, OUTLINING STREET CLOSURES FOR THIS SUMMER. IT WILL PROBABLY HAVE A BIT OF A SMALLER FOOTPRINT. IT SEEMS TO BE THE CASE THAT THE NEED IS NOT NECESSARILY THERE OR THE REPRESENTATION FOR THAT MATTER. AND THE NEED IS NOT NECESSARILY THAT GREAT IN KERRYTOWN. SO I IMAGINE THIS MIGHT BE A SMALLER FOOTPRINT, BUT HOPEFULLY JUST AS SUCCESSFUL, IF NOT MORE TO PROMOTE SOCIAL DISTANCING AND ALLOW OUR SMALL BUSINESSES TO THRIVE ONCE AGAIN HERE HOPEFULLY IN THE SUMMER. THAT WOULD GO INTO EFFECT ON APRIL 1st. THE CLOSURES WOULD BEGIN AS EARLY AS 5:00 OR SO ON THURSDAY AND REOPEN 6 A.M. ON MONDAY, BUT IT'S ALL TO THE DISCRETION OF THE ASSOCIATIONS AND ERR MERCHANTS THEM -- MERCHANTS THE BARRICADES AND TAKE THEM DOWN. I WANT TO REMIND THE RESIDENTS IN THE FIFTH WARD OF THE GROUNDWATER TESTING PROGRAM THE CITY EMPLOYED LAST YEAR BUT I DON'T THINK MANY PEOPLE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF BECAUSES A NATURAL FLOODING EVENT FOR PEOPLE TO CALL INTO THE WATER DEPARTMENT. BRIAN STEGLITZ AND OTHERS AT THE WATT DEPARTMENT WILL SEND REPRESENTATIVES FROM TETRA TECH TO GATHER SAMPLES TO BE TESTED FOR DIOXANE THAT MAY BE COMING IN THROUGH THE GROUNDWATER. THIS IS THE TIME OF YEAR THAT THAT WOULD BE OCCURRING. SO IF THERE'S SOME GROUNDWATER COMING INTO THE 85 HOMES THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED, PLEASE DO REACH OUT TO GET THAT DONE BECAUSE THAT CAN ONLY BE DONE IN THE SPRINGTIME, TYPICALLY. LASTLY, I WOULD LIKE TO THANK EVERYONE WHO CALLED IN TODAY ABOUT REIMAGINING PUBLIC SAFETY AND ADVOCATING FOR FUNDS FROM -- ANY FUNDS THAT ARE SAVED FROM THE POLICE BUDGET TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. THANK YOU.
00:52:21.018: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
00:52:22.286: >> Councilmember Griswold: LAST WEEK THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION HONORED DAN BECKNELL FOR HIS WORK ON THE REMEDIATION OF 1, 4, DIOXANE AND MANY MAY REMEMBER THAT DAN ACTUALLY DISCOVERED DIOXANE AS A U OF M STUDENT. THE RESOLUTION RECOMMENDED THAT IT BE FORWARDED TO CITY COUNCIL AS A RESOLUTION AND IT WILL BE ON THE AGENDA FOR OUR MARCH 15th PLEATING. I PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED CARD, THE COALITION ON ACTION FOR REMEDIATION OF DIOXANE, THEIR MEETING WILL BE TOMORROW AT 10 A.M. VIA ZOOM. IF ANYONE WOULD LIKE THE LINK, PLEASE EMAIL ME AND I WILL SHARE IT. CONGRESSWOMAN DEBBIE DINGLE WILL BE JOINING C.A.R.D. TOMORROW AT 10:30 A.M. TO SPEAK. THANK YOU.
00:53:18.976: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCIL MEMBER SONG.
00:53:21.145: >> Councilmember Song: FOR FOLKS WHO LOVE BOARD MEETINGS, THE A.A.D.L. IS HAVING THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES MEETING FROM 7 TO 8:30 AND PUBLIC COMMENTS ARE WELCOMED. WE HAVE TO HAVE A PUPPET TO DO IT. THEY DO USE ROBERT'S RULES. COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD AND A ARE WORKING ON A COFFEE HOUR TO ADDRESS SOME CONCERNS HERE IN WARD 2 ON A NEW DEVELOPMENT THAT MIGHT BE COMING AMONG EARHART ROAD. SO WE'RE COORDINATING THAT AND WE'LL ANNOUNCE THAT HOPEFULLY BY THE END OF THIS WEEK. AND THEN LASTLY, THERE'S BEEN ANTI-ASIAN SENTIMENT AND VIOLENCE AROUND THE COUNTRY. THERE WAS AN INCIDENT IN WARD TWO OVER THE WEEKEND. I WANTED TO REMIND FOLKS THAT IF YOU FEEL THREATENED OR IN DANGER, THIS IS -- IT'S A GOOD TIME TO CALL THE POLICE. YOU CAN ALSO LODGE A COMPLAINT WITH OUR HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION, AND THE MICHIGAN DEPARTMENT OF CIVIL RIGHTS. I WILL SEND THE LINKS TO EVERYONE ON COUNCIL HERE, BUT EVERY COUNCILMEMBER SHOULD BE ABLE TO DIRECT FOLKS TO THE RESOURCES NEEDED TO MAKE SURE THAT FOLKS ARE -- FEEL SAFE IN OUR COMMUNITY AND WELCOMED IN OUR COMMUNITY AND REMIND FOLKS THAT HATE HAS NO HOME HERE. THANK YOU.
00:54:35.886: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RADINA.
00:54:37.755: >> Councilmember Radina: THANK YOU, MAYOR TAYLOR. I WANT TO TURN MY FOCUS OF AN UPCOMING OPPORTUNITY THAT COUNCILMEMBER GRAND ANNOUNCED AT OUR LAST MEETING. SHE AND I ARE PARTNERING TOGETHER ON ANOTHER COFFEE HOUR FOR WARD THREE RESIDENTS AND THAT'S COMING UP THIS SUNDAY, MARCH 7th AT 4 P.M., AND SO YOU CAN RSVP ON OUR FACEBOOK EVENT OR IF YOU SEND US AN EMAIL, WE ARE HAPPY TO INCLUDE THE LINK, BACK TO YOU THAT WAY TO PARTICIPATE. THANKS.
00:55:06.384: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
00:55:07.685: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANKS MAYOR TAYLOR. ONE ADD ON, THE C.A.R.D. MEETING IS AT 10 A.M. IT'S THE D.E.Q. UPDATE. IT'S AN EARLY MEETING. AND SECONDLY, I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE WITH FOLKS THAT WE HAD A MEETING UP HERE -- IT WAS A WARD MEETING BUT THERE WERE FOLKS FROM ALL OVER THE CITY INVOLVED WITH OUR POLICE CHIEF AND SERGEANT MILLS ABOUT THEIR COMMUNITY POLICING EFFORTS WHICH THEY NOW ACTUALLY -- THEY DON'T CALL IT COMMUNITY POLICING ANYMORE AND THEY CALL IT COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIP AND OUTREACH TEAM THAT THEY FORMED. OF THE TOPICS THAT ARE PUBLIC HEARING COMMENTED ON WERE DISCUSSED HAT THAT MEETING AND OUR CHIEF AND THE COMMAND STAFF SEEMED VERY AMENABLE TO THESE PROJECTS. IT'S -- THESE ARE GOOD IDEAS THAT ARE HAPPENING ELSEWHERE IN THE -- IN THE STATES HERE, AND SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD -- I WAS REALLY PLEASED WITH WHAT THEY HAD TO SAY AT THIS MEETING AND HOW -- HOW WILLING THEY ARE TO REACH OUT TO THE COMMUNITY AND FIND BETTER WAYS TO DO POLICING, BETTER WAYS TO PROVIDE PUBLIC SAFETY GENERALLY. I'M EXCITED ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITIES WE HAVE TO MAKE THESE CHANGES AND OBVIOUSLY, I WON'T SPEAK FOR THE CHIEF OR THE DEPUTY CHIEF OR ANYBODY ELSE OVER THERE, BUT THEY DID SEE VERY AMENABLE TO THESE KINDS OF PROGRAMS AND I WAS EXCITED TO HEAR THAT. SO I THINK WE ARE GOING TO HAVE SOME GOOD ACTION ON THESE ISSUES IN THE FUTURE.
00:56:34.738: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER DISCH.
00:56:35.906: >> Councilmember Disch: GOOD EVENING. I JUST WANTED TO ALSO SPEAK AS COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD DID TO THE ACTIONS OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION. AND I WANTED TO LET EVERYBODY KNOW THAT THERE'S A LOT OF ACTIVITY GOING ON ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION. A LOT OF SUBGROUPS, DOING REAL WORK AND A REAL FOCUS OF THIS GROUP IS TO IMPLEMENT OUR SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT PLAN IN WAYS THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH AND FORWARD AND ACCELERATE PROGRESS TOWARDS OUR A2ZERO GOALS. AND SO KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN, BECAUSE JOHN BURRSKI IS DEVELOPING A RESOLUTION WHICH WILL COME TO COUNCIL FROM THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION THAT REQUESTS THE CITY TO EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY OF BIWEEKLY TRASH PICKUP WHICH WILL BE COUPLED WITH INT INTENSIFYING TO ENCOURAGE RECYCLING AND COMPOSTING AND WOULD BE MINDFUL OF THE IMPACTS ON LABOR. JUST TO LET YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S COMING. THANKS.
00:57:32.530: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS.
00:57:36.133: >> Councilmember Briggs: THANK YOU. I WANTED TO PROVIDE A BRIEF UPDATE ON A GREAT PRESENTATION THAT WE GOT AT TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION LAST MONTH FROM COLEMAN, THE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT SPECIALIST. SHE WAS PRESENTING ON COMMUNITY EQUITABLE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT. I WILL SEND THAT POWERPOINT PRESENTATION AROUND TO ALL OF COUNCIL BUT WANTED TO DRAW OTHER'S ATTENTION TO IT AS WELL, SINCE WE HAD BEEN SPEAKING ABOUT THAT ISSUE. AND IT DOES SOME REALLY GREAT WORK IN THE SYSTEM'S PLANNING UNIT, DOCUMENTING WHERE -- DOCUMENTING THE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND DOCUMENTING WHERE WE ARE SEEING UNDERREPRESENTATION IN -- IN FOLKS SPEAKING AND IT'S PRETTY WELL DOCUMENTED THAT WE HAVE -- WE NEED TO BOOST OUR PARTICIPATION FROM NONWHITE, FROM YOUNGER, FROM LESS ANUENT AFFLUENTAND THOSE WHO ARE EDGE G IN OUR COMMUNITY. -- THOSE WHO ARE RENTING IN OUR COMMUNITY.

I WOULD LIKE TO RECOMMEND THE FOLLOWING NOMINATIONS FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION TO THE COMMISSION ON DISABILITY, KINSEY BUTTON, AND TO THE HURON RIVER WATERSHED JANICE OBROON. I WOULD LIKE TO LIKE TO THANK REPRESENTATIVE DINGLE, TO MEET WITH THE GELMAN INTERVENORS AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE AND THE EPA. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE UNDERSTAND WHAT IS GOING ON AND WE ACT IN CONCERT WITH ONE ANOTHER. I THANK OUR DOGGED CONGRESSIONAL REPRESENTATIVE FOR HER EFFORTS IN THIS REGARD. FINALLY, TOUCHING A LITTLE BIT UPON THE ISSUE THAT WAS RAISED BY A NUMBER OF OUR SPEAKERS. I HAD FOR SOMETIME NOW BEEN DISCUSSED UNARMED RESPONSE WITH CHIEF COX AND MR. CRAWFORD, I WANT TO TOUCH ABOUT SOME OF THE OBSTACLES THAT WE HAVE IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND THE UNARMED RESPONSE PROGRAM, A PROGRAM THAT I BELIEVE TO BE CRITICAL. BUT IN ORDER TO MAKE IT SUCCESSFUL, I THINK WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND AND MOVE FORWARD WITH OUR EYES OPENED BECAUSE SUCCESSFUL POLICY REQUIRES VISION AND FLOW CHARTS. AS I UNDERSTAND IT PRESENTLY, PRIMARY AMONG THE WIND CHILLS IS THAT THE MINUTE -- CHALLENGE IS THE MUNICIPAL HAS EXPERTISE IN MENTAL HEALTH. THAT RESIDES IN COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH. ALSO AND, YOU KNOW, VERY SUBSTANTIAL IMPORTANCE, WE ALSO LACK CONTROL OVER OUR 911 DISPATCH SYSTEM. THAT IS UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF THE SHERIFF. IN OTHER WORDS IF WE ARE GOING TO RE-INVENT -- UNLESS WE ARE GOING TO RE-INVENT THE WHEEL, IN HE WILL STAND UP MEANINGFUL, UNARMED RESPONSE IN THE CITY OF FARM AS I WANT TO DO AND I BELIEVE MEMBERS THE COMMUNITY AND THIS BODY DO, WE WILL NEED TO COOPERATE AND PARTICIPATE WITH C.M.H. AND THE SHERIFF. AND FOR MY PART, I'M COMMITTED TO DOING THAT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT COOPERATION AND THE PARTICIPATION BECOMES A REALITY. TOWARDS THAT END, YOU KNOW, I HAVE ASKED STAFF TO PUT TOGETHER A RESOLUTION OF CONSTRUCTION FOR COUNCIL'S CONSIDERATION TO PROVIDE SOME DIRECTION AND STRUCTURE REQUEST REGARD TO DEVELOPMENT OF THIS KIND OF PROGRAM, A PROGRAM OF UNARMED RESPONSE. I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHEN THAT WILL COME BEFORE US, WHICH IT'S THE NEXT MEETING OR THE NEXT, BUT IT IS BUDGET SEASON AND I GUESS WE'LL HEAR IT SOON. IT'S AN IMPORTANT ISSUE. WE HAVE BEFORE THE US THE CONSENT AGENDA. MOVED BY DISCH AND SECONDED BY GRISWOLD. DISCUSSION OF THE CONSENT AGENDA. REPRESENTATIVE HAYNER.
01:04:13.830: >> Councilmember Hayner: C.A.7 COMES OUT OF THE LIQUOR REVIEW BOARD AND THE CONVERSATION AROUND THAT WAS PRETTY INTERESTING. THE WHOLE MEETING WAS PRETTY INTERESTING THIS TIME AND THERE'S SOME OTHER THINGS FURTHER ON THE AGENDA THAT YOU WILL SEE ABOUT THAT. IT'S NICE THAT WE HAVE A GENTLEMAN WHO IS REPURPOSING AND PLANNING TO REPURPOSE A DOWNTOWN SPACE THAT'S SORT OF BELOVED SPACE, THE OLD PEACEABLE KINGDOM BUILDING TO BE A SORT OF MORE OF A PUBLIC MEETING SPACE AROUND SOME PEOPLE'S FAVORITE THINGS, VINYL RECORDS AND A BAR.

THINK IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXERCISE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO GET THOSE THINGS OFF THE BOOKS AND CLEAR THE BOOKS AND I TALKED TO SOME FOLKS AT THE COUNTY ABOUT IT TOO AND I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ARE GOING TO -- I WANT TO BRING FORWARD THIS YEAR. I WANT TO BRING A PROCESS FORWARD THAT ANY TIME A CITY PROPERTY COMES FROM TOWNSHIP INTO THE CITY, THAT IT BECOMES UNDER OUR AUSPICES AND OUR BORDERS THAT WE TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK FOR THOSE. APPARENTLY THEY ARE OUT THERE ON THE BOOKS. THEY STILL EXIST AND IT'S A TERRIBLE THING. IT'S SORT OF A REMNANT OF OUR PAST THAT NEEDS TO BE IN MY OPINION ERASED. I WANT TO THOUGH THIS OUT THERE. IT'S NOT AL STRAIGHT UP ANNEXATION, IT'S SIMILAR. THESE OPPORTUNITIES EXIST FOR US TO ACT AS A CITY AND I LOOK IN ORDER TO BRINGING THAT FORWARD SOON. THANK YOU.
01:10:30.340: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. C-4, AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND SECTION 1:271 (4) OF CHAPTER 12, FINANCING LOCAL PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS OF TITLE I OF THE CODE OF OF THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER DISCH. SECONDED BY RAMLAWI. DISCUSSION, PLEASE OF C-4? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. C-5, AN ORDINANCE TO ADD CHAPTES TO HOUSING TO THE TITLE IX OF THE CODE OF THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. MOVED AND SECONDED. DISCUSSION OF C-5? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
01:11:21.524: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANKS, I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE FOLKS FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. I WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A COSPONSOR OF THIS. I THINK THIS IS YET ANOTHER WAY IN WHICH WE CAN TAKE A LOOK AT HELPING FOLKS IN OUR COMMUNITY AND OPENING UP HOUSING, OPENING UP ACCESS TO HOUSING. IT'S APPROPRIATE THAT WE DO THIS. I KNOW COUNCILWOMAN NELSON AND I HAVE SPOKEN ABOUT SOME OTHER ISSUES AROUND THIS MATTER, WITH THE RENTAL LEASE DURATIONS AND SO ON AND SO I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT COMING FORWARD TOO AND I JUST THINK SOMETIMES THESE SEEM LIKE LITTLE -- WROTE LITTLE THINGS BUT IT WILL ADD UP TO ACCESS FOR PEOPLE. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ONE, SO THANK YOU FOR THE FOL BRINGING THIS FWARD.
01:12:07.437: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER NELS?
01:12:08.338: >> Cncilmember Neln: THK YOU. THIS ISSUE WAS TAKEN OFF TO MY ATTEION AND I HAD TO PASS IT OFF TO THUMAN RIGHTS COMMISON. GHTSCOISSION. MY FIRST MEETI THEY WERE DIUSSING THIS ISSUE AND I W SOXCITEDO HEAR -- JUST HEAR HOW SERIOUSLYT WAS BEING CONSIDERED ANDOW IT W MOVING FOARD WITHISCUSSION AROD AT OTHER COMMUNITI WERE ING THIS IS JUST A RLLY, GLAD TO SEE TT COUNCILMEMB GRAND RAISED HER HAND AS SHE WAS ON HRC AND WCHEDT GO FOARD. I CGHT I IN T MIDDLE AND THEN COUNCILMEMBER RADINA CAUGHT IT AT THE END. BUT THIS IS GOING TO BE AN IMPORTANT AND MEANINGFUL CHANGE. THANK YOU.
01:12:47.010: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RADINA.
01:12:48.912: >> Councilmember Radina: THANK YOU. YEAH, AND I ALSO WANT TO THANK COUNCILMEMBER GRAND AND COUNCILMEMBER NELSON FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS PRIOR TO MY JOINING HRC, BUT I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSIONERS AND THE ATTORNEY FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS. I THINK THIS IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO DO AS A COMMUNITY TO ELIMINATE THIS KIND OF DISCRIMINATION THAT EXISTS AGAINST FORMERLY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS, WHICH WE KNOW WITH -- PARTICULARLY WITH THE RACIAL INEQUITIES THAT EXIST IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM, THIS HAS A DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON BLACK RESIDENTS AND ON OTHER PEOPLE OF COLOR, BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT FORMERLY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS ARE ALSO DISPROPORTIONATELY HOMELESS AS WELL. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT STEP TOWARDS PROVIDING ADDITIONAL HOUSING SUPPORT AND ACCESS FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE REALLY BEEN FACING A FORM OF DISCRIMINATION THAT I THINK FOR TOO LONG HAS KIND OF FLOATED UNDER THE RADAR. SO THANKS, EVERYBODY, FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS, AND I'M JUST GLAD THAT I WAS ABLE TO ADD MY NAME AS A COSPONSOR. SO THANKS.
01:13:51.207: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
01:13:53.476: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MY NAME ADDED AS A COSPONSOR. I WAS THRILLED TO BE PART OF THIS CONVERSATION ON HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION. I SEE THAT WE HAVE NOT ONLY ATTORNEY RADABAUGH WHO WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN GETTING THIS FORWARD AND COMMISSIONERS WINKLER AND COWAN SO IF ANYONE HAS QUESTIONS BEING I'M SURE THEY CAN ANSWER THEM. I WANT TO RECOGNIZE AARON SITIYAMA WHO WAS REALLY THE FORCE TO BRINGING THIS TO HRC, AND HIS ADVOCACY AS -- AS AN ADVOCATE, AS A FORMERLY INCARCERATED PERSON WHO WAS ABLE TO REALLY SPEAK FROM HIS OWN LIVED EXPERIENCE ABOUT WHY THIS IS SO CRITICAL AND HIS OWN STRUGGLES DESPITE BEING WHAT WE THINK OF AS SOMEONE WHO HAS USED THEIR EXPERIENCES TO HELP OTHERS WHO HAVE COME AFTER THEM. BUT I BUT REALLY STRUGGLE TO FID HOUSING. I REMEMBER BEING EXCITED IN THE EARLY CONVERSATIONS AND APPRECIATED THAT I GOT TO BE EXCITED ABOUT THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND OUR COMMISSIONERS HAVE HELPED TO BRING IT TO US THIS EVENING. SO THANKS.
01:15:15.425: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER EYER.
01:15:18.494: >> Councilmember Eyer: THANK YOU. I THINK THERE'S STILL ROOM. I WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A COSPONSOR. THIS WAS ONE OF THE OBJECTIVES THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT I WORKED ON WITH ACLU OF MICHIGAN BACK IN 2016, ELIMINATING THE USE OF CRIMINAL HISTORY IN SELECTING TENANTS. AND SO IT'S -- YOU KNOW, IT'S MEANINGFUL TO ME TO BE ABLE TO VOTE FOR THIS NOW, AND I JUST APPRECIATE THE FOLKS WHO WORKED ON IT AND WOULD HAVE BROUGHT IT FORWARD. IT'S THE -- AND WHO HAVE BROUGHT IT FORWARD. IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO.
01:15:50.460: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:15:51.327: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, MAYOR. AND THANKS TO THE FOLKS ON THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS. I KNOW THEY WERE WORKING ON THIS FOR A LONG TIME. THEY WERE WORKING ON IT WHEN I WAS ON THE COMMISSION, AND THAT WAS QUITE SOMETIME AGO. AND SO IT'S BEEN A WHILE. I HAVE A QUESTION. THIS IS PART OF A GREATER MOVEMENT THAT WE ARE SEEING, CRIMINAL REPORTS BEING EXPUNGED, FIRST-TIME OFFENDERS, ACT BEING TAKEN AT THE STATE LEVEL, HOPEFULLY AT THE TRAVEL THAT WILL, YOU KNOW, MAKE MATTERS EVEN BETTER. THAT'S ONE ISSUE THAT BOTH THE SIDES OF THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM CAN AGREE ON. AND SO -- BUT THE QUESTIONS CAME UP LAST NIGHT DURING CAUCUS ABOUT PROSECUTION OF THESE, AND IF SOMEONE FROM THE ATTORNEY'S OFFICE OR STAFF CAN BRIEFLY EXPLAIN TO US HOW MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY CAN GO ABOUT REPORTING THIS AND JUST KIND OF AN EXECUTIVE SUMMARY WAY, IF POSSIBLE. I KNOW THE ORDINANCE IS HERE WITH US THE ATTACHMENTS BUT WHILE WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY AND THE TIME, THANKS.
01:17:14.143: >> I CAN TAKE THAT QUESTION. SO THE INITIAL COMPLAINT WOULD GO TO THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION. AND THEY WOULD DO AN INVESTIGATION LIKE THEY DO WITH ANYTHING THAT ARISES UNDER THE NONDISCRIMINATION ORDINANCE. SO THE PRO E SIS WOULD BE VERY SIMILAR -- PROCESS WOULD BE VERY SIMILAR. THEY TRY TO WORK IT OUT AMONGST THE PARTIES TO COME TO A MUTUALLY AGREEABLE SOLUTION. IF THEY CAN'T, IT'S REFERRED TO THE CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE AND THEN WE CAN PROSECUTE THE MATTER UNDER THE ORDINANCE LIKE WE WOULD WITH ANY OTHER ORDINANCE.
01:17:44.040: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  AND I WOULD IMAGINE YOU HAVE DONE YOUR HOMEWORK, BUT THERE'S NO FEDERAL OR STATE LAWS THAT WOULD PRECLUDE US FROM ENFORCING THIS?
01:17:53.249: >> THAT'S CORRECT. THE ONE ISSUE WAS PUBLIC HOUSING AUTHORITIES. SO THEY HAVE FEDERAL LAWS THAT REQUIRE THEM TO RUN CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECKS IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. SO WE EXEMPTED THE ANN ARBOR HOUSING COMMISSION AND ANY OTHER PUBLIC HOUSING AUTHORITY.
01:18:07.530: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANKS FOR THAT CLARIFICATION. APPRECIATE IT.
01:18:14.137: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER DISCH?
01:18:16.773: >> Councilmember Disch: YES, I WOULD LIKE TO ADD MY VOICE TO THE CHORUS OF THANKS FOR THIS WORK. I KNOW THESE THINGS -- THEY TAKE A LOT OF -- MUCH MORE EFFORT THAN THEY WITH THEY SHOULD. I'M REALLY GRATEFUL FOR THAT, AND THIS IS ANOTHER -- THIS IS A GREAT FOLLOW-UP TO, WHICH MADE IT ILLEGAL TO REQUIRE A JOB APPLICANT FOR DISCLOSING THAT THEY COMMITTED A FELONY ON THEIR JOB APPLICATION. I'M HAPPY TO SEE THAT WE KEEP THIS MOVING AND IF THIS IS ANY ROOM, I WOULD LOVE TO BE ADDED AS A COSPONSOR AND IF THERE ISN'T, I'M SO HAPPY THAT WE ARE UNIFIED BEHIND THIS.
01:18:58.147: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER. THANK >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY. I ENDERWONDER IF MS. RADABAUGH, THEY MAY BE REQUIRED TO RUN A BACKGROUND CHECK. I DON'T WANT TO MAKE THE ASSUMPTION BUT I WOULD HOPE TO ASSUME THAT OUTSIDE OF VERY SPECIFIC REQUIRED CIRCUMSTANCES THAT THEY MAKE NO CONSIDERATION OF THE RESULTS OF THAT CHECK, RIGHT? IT'S VERY OPEN IN SERVING THE MOST NEEDED. IS THAT ACCURATE?
01:19:33.783: >> YES. SORRY. YES, SO JENNIFER HALL ACTUALLY, SHE CAME TO SPEAK TO THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION, AND SHE WORKED WITH US ON THIS ORDINANCE. SO SHE'S VERY SUPPORTIVE OF IT AND YES, EXACTLY AS YOU DESCRIBED IT. THE ANN ARBOR HOUSING COMMISSION, YOU KNOW, THEY ARE NOT TRYING TO EXCLUDE PEOPLE FROM HOUSING.
01:19:50.566: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I APPRECIATE YOU SETTING THAT OUT THERE, THEY MIGHT WONDER WHY THEY WERE EXENTERRED BUT I CAN'T I MAGGEN -- EXEMPTED BUT I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT THEY WOULD EVER, EVER USE THAT AS A REASON. SO THANK YOU.
01:20:14.023: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MY NAME ADDED. FORMERLY INCARCERATED PEOPLE FACE DISCRIMINATION ON OM LEVELS AND IMPORTANT THAT WE PROVIDE SOME PROTECTIONS HERE IN ANN ARBOR AND I'M HAPPY IT'S MOVING FORWARD. SO THANK YOU. FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. THANK YOU, EVERYBODY. SEE YOU NEXT WEEK. DC-1 Resolution to Waive Attorney-Client Privilege on Advice Regarding Council Rules. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER NELSON, AND SECONDED BY RAMLAWI. COUNCILMEMBER NELSON?
01:21:07.843: >> Councilmember Nelson:  ON JANUARY 19th, I ASKED OUR LEGAL DEPARTMENT TO PREPARE A MEMO SPECIFICALLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF RELEASE TO THE PUBLIC ON THIS TOPIC. THIS REQUEST MADE SEVERAL PEOPLE SAYING I WAS PRO CENSORSHIP. FEBRUARY 1st, COUNCIL PASSED AMENDED COUNCIL RULES, AND AFTER WE DID THAT, AFTER AN MLIVE ARTICLE WAS PUBLISHED, AN ACLU LAWYER CONTACTED ME WITH CONCERNS THAT THE NEW RULES WE PASSED WERE PROBLEMATIC. COUNCIL RECEIVED AN ADDITIONAL LEGAL MEMO FROM OUR ATTORNEYS ON FEBRUARY 8th. FEBRUARY 16th WE RECONSIDERED THE RULES AND ASKED THAT THEY BE DELAYED FOR THE ACLU WEIGHED IN. TONIGHT I'M ASKING THAT PRIVILEGE BE WAIVED ON TWO LEGAL MEMOS WRITTEN ON JANUAR JANUARY 30th AND FEBRUARY 8th. THEY WERE WRITTEN AFTER THE LEGAL DEPARTMENT WAS ALREADY ALERTED TO THE FACT THAT THIS TOPIC WAS OF INTEREST AND VAULTY VALUETO THE PUBLIC. IT'S NOT THE SUBJECT OF LITIGATION. WAIVERRING PRIVILEGE DOES NOT PUT US IN ANY LEGAL PERIL. IT'S NOT PART OF ANY PATTERN OR TREND TO RECKLESSLY OR HAPHAZARD TO WAIVE LEGAL PRIVILEGE. THERE WAS VERY HELPFUL AND RELEVANT ADVICE BEFORE WE AMENDED THE COUNCIL RULES. I EXPECT THAT TO BE BACKED UP BY THE ACLU. WE WILL GET AN OPINION FROM THE ACLU. WE DID NOT SOLICIT THEIR OPINION, BUT THEY ARE MEETING TO DISCUSS THIS ISSUE AND OFFER AN OPINION. THEY DO NOT NEED THE MEMOS TO OFFER AN OPINION, BUT I INCLUDED THE ACLU IN THIS RESOLUTION, BECAUSE THEY WERE INTERESTED IN THESE MEMOS. THANK YOU. THAT'S IT.
01:23:19.542: >> Mayor Taylor: THE SPONSOR. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:23:22.845: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU FOR EXPLAINING THE TIMELINE. I WILL PROBABLY REITERATE A FEW AND REPEAT IT, BUT OBVIOUSLY, WE ADOPTED NEW RULES GOVERNING COUNCIL'S ACTIONS WE GOT TO THE LAST SECTION AND THE SPEECH OF COUNCILMEMBERS, OUTSIDE OF BOARD MEMBERS. THAT ISHE PART THAT RAISED CONCERN FOR ME, AS SOMEONE WHO IS SWORN TO DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES, OF THE STATE OF MICHIGAN AND OUR CITY CHARTER FOR THAT MATTER. AND I FEEL THAT THIS IS IN DIRECT CONFLICT OF UPHDING MY OATH TO DEFEND THOSE. I BELIEVE THE RULES THAT WERE ADOADOPTEDAVE A CLLING EFFT ON THE DISSEING POLITICAL MINORITY AND THEIRIGHTS T FREEDOM  EXPRESSION. AFRDOPTING THESE RULES -- RULES, I WASPPROACHED B THE LY WHO HAD THE- ACLU WHO H THE SAME CONCES AS THE RES TO HOWHEY APPLY TO COUNCILMEMBERS OUTSIDE OF OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT BUSINESS. SO WE'RE ASKING FOR THIS TO BE WAIVED. THIS ISSUE IS NOT AS SUCH AS GELMAN WE ARE IN A LONG LITIGIOUS MATTER, OR REAL ESTATE, OR EMPLOYMENT. IT'S SOMETHING THAT WAS DONE WELL BY OUR LEGAL DEPARTMENT AND ACLU DOESN'T NECESSARILY NEED THEM, BUT WE ARE ASKING BECAUSE WE FEEL THAT THESE DOCUMENTS ALSO PERTAIN TO US AS INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS, EVEN THOUGH OUR LEGAL STAFF DEFENDS THE BODY, BUT IT ALSO DEFENDS INDIVIDUAL COUNCILMEMBERS. THANK YOU.
01:26:05.341: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
01:26:07.810: >> Councilmember Grand: I'M UNABLE TO SUPPORT DC-1 WAS IT STANDS. I WOULD LIKE TO OFFER AN AMENDMENT THAT WOULD REPLACE DC-1 WITH THE FOLLOWING LANGUAGE. AND IT WAS ALREADY SENT TO ALL OF COUNCIL EARLIER TODAY. IT WAS ACTUALLY -- IT'S NOT MY LANGUAGE, IT'S TO ALLOW THE CITY ATTORNEY TO DIRECT PUBLIC COMMENT AND THE COUNCIL IS CONSIDERING POSSIBLE CHANGING TO THE RULES RELATING TO PUBLIC COMMENTARY, RESOLVE THAT THE CITY ATTORNEY PROVIDE A PUBLIC MEMO ON THE GENERAL ISSUES -- OH, GOSH. WITH RESPECT TO PUBLIC COMMENTARY AND THE OPEN MEETINGS ACT AND THAT'S AMAZING. IT DOESN'T WANT ME TO READ IT. IT LITERALLY JUST DISAPPEARED OFF MY SCREEN. SO I APOLOGIZE. AND I'M HOPING SOMEONE CAN HELP ME BECAUSE MY COMPUTER BLANKED AS I WAS READING IT. MS. BEAUDRY SENT IT AROUND.
01:27:25.454: >> Mayor Taylor: IF I CAN, BECAUSE YOU KENT IT AROUND THAT SECOND RESOLVE CLAUSE READS RESOLVE THAT THE CITY ATTORNEY PROVIDE A PUBLIC MEMO ON THE GENERAL ISSUE OF COUNCIL SPEECH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF COUNCIL MEETINGS, WITH RESPECT TO THE O.M.A. AND THE COUNCILMEMBER. DOES THAT SOUND RIGHT?
01:27:44.239: >> Councilmember Grand: IT SURE DOES. NOW I CAN SEE IT IN FRONT OF ME AGAIN.
01:27:47.142: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE A SECOND TO THAT AMENDMENT? SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS. COUNCILMEMBER, YOU STILL HAVE THE FLOOR.
01:27:56.819: >> Councilmember Grand: I EXPRESSED MY CONCERNS IN THE PAST ABOUT WHY I DON'T THINK IT'S GENERA GENERALLY GOOD PRACR US TO BE RELEASING MEMOS THAT ARE INTENDED FOR COUNCIL, AND I ALSO I BELIEVE THAT THIS PROCESS WAS UNDER IN DISCUSSION AT THIS TABLE, . IF THE ACLU WANTS TO TAKE THIS ON, THEY DON'T NEED OUR ATTORNEY'S MEMOS TO DO SO. SO THAT'S GREAT.
01:28:33.389: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
01:28:35.758: >> Councilmember Hayner:  ON THE AMENDMENT. YEAH. I'M GOING TO PASS. I WAS WILLING TO SPEAK ON THE FIRST ONE. I DON'T HAVE ANY COMMENT ABOUT THIS. I THOUGHT THAT THE AMENDMENTS -- I THOUGHT THAT THE INFORMATION RECEIVED FROM OUR ATTORNEY WAS WELL-WRITTEN AND INFORMATIVE TO READ. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE CITY TO SEE THE WORK THAT OUR ATTORNEY'S OFFICE DID TO PUT THIS INFORMATION TOGETHER FOR US. I'M HAPPY TO SEE THEM -- I'M HAPPY TO LET THE PUBLIC HAVE A LOOK AT IT. I'M TRYING TO COMPARE WHAT THE DIFFERENCE IS BETWEEN THESE TWO. SO I WILL LET SOMEBODY ELSE SPEAK.
01:29:24.072: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI. RAM .>> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, MAYOR TAYLOR. I SAW THIS COME TO US A FEW HOURS AGO. I APPRECIATE STAFF'S PREPARING IT. MY CONCERN IS THAT IT DOES NOT REFERENCE COUNCIL RULES. THIS REFERENCES O.M.A., BUT, NOT THE RECENT COUNCIL RULES. IF THERE'S A FRIENDLY AMENDMENT TO INCLUDE THAT, THEN IT WOULD ADDRESS A BIG CONCERN OF LINE.
01:30:03.812: >> City Atty. Postema: IT WOULD INCLUDE THAT. AS PART OF COUNCIL COMMENTARY. BUT, YES.
01:30:12.588: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: OUTSIDE OF IN PUBLIC VENUES, THAT PORTION OF THOSE NEW RULES?
01:30:21.864: >> City Atty. Postema: INSIDE AND OUTSIDE, COUNCILMEMBER.
01:30:23.832: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES. AND I IMAGINE MOST OF THIS WORK HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE. I MEAN WE HAVE RECEIVED ANOTHER UPDATED VERSION OF ADVICE. I WOULD IMAGINE THIS WORK IS ALREADY DONE. IT WILL MIGHT NEED A LITTLE REDACTION BUT NOT MUCH.
01:30:46.021: >> City Atty. Postema: THE UPDATED PUBLIC COMMENTARY YOU HAD, IT WAS ACTUALLY JUST TO SIMPLIFY SOME THINGS FOR THE COUNCIL. SO THAT'S DONE. AND CAN BE TRANSFORMED INTO THIS. PROBABLY WITHOUT MUCH WORK. THE OTHER DOCUMENT YOU ARE GETTING A MAJOR DOCUMENT ON ALL OF THE ISSUES RELATING TO COUNCIL RULES, AND THAT, AS I TOLD YOU BEFORE, SHOULD BE DONE BY THIS FRIDAY OR LATEST NEXT MONDAY. AND THAT WILL BE, AGAIN, TWO MAJOR PIECES OF WORK AND THIS RESOLUTION AFTER YOU HAVE -- AFTER YOU FINISHED THAT, I'M NOT GOING TO D DO THE PUBLIC ONE UNL YOU GET BOTH OF THOSE AND THEN BOTH OF THE PUBLIC ONES WOULD COME OUT THROUGH THIS RESOLUTION, YES.
01:31:30.532: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TO ANSWER THAT. I DON'T REALLY HAVE MUCH TO OBJECT. BECAUSE AS WAS STATED THE ACLU DOESN'T NEED THESE MEMOS TO DO WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO DO. SO IT -- IT -- EITHER WAY, IT WOULD BE NICE JUST TO SHOW THAT THE SCHOLARSHIP THAT OUR CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE HAS WITHOUT, YOU KNOW -- THEY ALREADY GAVE US GOOD ADVICE. IT WOULD BE GOOD TO SHARE THAT ADVICE AND ALLOW THE PUBLIC TO SEE THE ADVICE THAT WE ARE GIVEN WHEN WE MAKE DECISIONS. BUT THIS WILL SUFFICE.
01:32:14.276: >> City Atty. Postema: AS THE COUNCIL KNOWS, THE COMMITTEE WILL LOOK AT NUMEROUS RULES RELATING TO THE PUBLIC AND ADDITIONAL COUNCIL THINGS. SO THAT'S REALLY IN THEIR HANDS AND ULTIMATELY THE COUNCIL AND THIS WILL SORT OF FIT INTO WITH THE WHOLE FRAMEWORK. SO I'M HAPPY TO DO THIS.
01:32:31.727: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS?
01:32:33.528: >> Councilmember Briggs: THANKS. I'M GLAD TO SEE THIS AMENDMENT. I THINK THIS IS A GREAT SOLUTION FOR GETTING INFORMATION OUT THAT FOLKS WOULD LIKE TO SEE. I WOULD SUBJECT THAT AS OTHER SAID, IT'S GOOD WORK. AS WE SING THE PRAISES OF OUR CITY ATTORNEY. AND OUR CITY ATTORNEY SAID TWICE IN 2020, WE DOES NOT ADVISE THAT WE RELEASE CONFIDENTIAL LEGAL MEMOS AND THIS IS THE PRO E SESS THAT WE HAVE BEEN RECOMMENDED TO -- PROCESS THAT WE HAVE BEEN RECOMMENDED TO FOLLOW, WHICH IS CREATING MEMOS FOR THE PUBLIC WHEN WE WANT TO RELEASE INFORMATION. SO FOLLOWING OUR CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE ADVICE, I THINK THAT IS A GREAT PATH FORWARD.
01:33:19.474: >> City Atty. Postema: I MIGHT ALSO MENTION THIS IS THE -- WHAT WE DID WITH THE COUNCIL ETHICS BACK IN 2014. WE HAVE DONE IT ON A NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS. I THINK IT WILL BE, PERHAPS, SATISFACTORY TO EVERYBODY, AND WHILE THE INFORMATION CERTAINLY MIGHT -- MIGHT GENERATE DEBATE OR, YOU KNOW, OTHERWISE, IT WOULD ALSO HELP YOU AND THE PUBLIC UNDERSTAND THE TYPE OF RULES AND THE ISSUES OUT THERE WITH THE LAWS THAT ARE NOT ALWAYS EASY TO FOLLOW, BUT I THINK THINK  IT WILL BE USEFUL.
01:34:07.622: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:34:08.523: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: JUST A RESPONSE TO THE ISSUES OF PRIOR REQUESTS THAT COUNCIL HAVE ASKED OF WAIVING PRIVILEGE, I VOTED NO ON THOSE PRIOR REQUESTS, AT LEAST THE ONE THAT HAD TEN YEARS OF REQUESTS UNDER IT. I UNDERSTAND THE CLIENT AND THE ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. THE ATTORNEY'S OFFICE DEFENDS AND REPRESENTS EACH INDIVIDUAL MEMBER OF COUNCIL, AS WELL AS THE BODY. AND THEN THIS CASE, WHY I WAS ASKING FOR THIS H MEMO WAS FOR THIS TO BEEN HADDING IN DEFENDING INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS RIGHTS OF THIS BODY. THERE'S MORE THAN JUST THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE BODY AND THE ATTORNEY'S OFFICE, THERE'S THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL COUNCILMEMBERS A THE ATTORNEY'S OFFICE AS WELL.
01:35:13.789: >> Mayor Tlor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE AMENDMENT? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
01:35:20.495: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. CUNCOUNCILMEMBER NELSON, OR COUNCILMEMBER GRAND. DOES THIS SATISFY THE DESIRES TO HAVE THIS INFORMATION, SUCH AS IT IS RELEASED? I MEAN, I -- I WAS PERFECTLY WILLING TO RELEASE WHAT WE HAVE ALREADY RECEIVED INSTEAD OF ASKING FOR A REWRITE FROM OUR ALREADY BURDENED LEGAL DEPARTMENT, AND SO I -- YOU KNOW, I DON'T WANT TO BE NAY SAYER ON THESE AMEN AMENDMENTS T I WONDER IF THE ORIGINAL SPONSOR WOULD LIKE TO MEANT.
01:36:08.009: >> Councilmember Grand: RIGHT IT IS THE LEGAL COUNCIL TO FOLLOW THROUGH.
01:36:12.347: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER. WE HAVE COUNCILMEMBER NELSON IN THE QUEUE.
01:36:15.717: >> Councilmember Nelson: ACTUALLY, TO SPEAK SOMEWHAT TO COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER'S POINT THIS DOESN'T ACTUALLY ADDRESS THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE RESOLUTION, BUT I'M VERY PLEASED TO HAVE THE SAME DISCUSSION NOW WITHOUT DARK CLOUDS OF BEING PRO CENSORSHIP. I WOULD LIK TO BE A
01:36:47.616: >> City ty. Postema: I DON'T WANT ANY DARK CLOUDS A WHERE. ASAR AS THE TIMING, CERTAINLHE PUBLIC COMMENTAR ON THE MEMON PUBLIC COMNTARY NEXT CNCIL MEETI AND THET MEMO ON THE COUNCILT THAT TIME DON'T AICATE ANSSUE WITH GETTG BOTH O THEM ON THEY WL CTAINLYAVE THE ONE AND IF -- IF IT' LATER AFTER THAT MEENG, I WILL PUBLIC SIZE IT IN SOME OTHER WAY. SO IF YOU GIVE ME SOME FLEXIBILITY.
01:37:32.694: >> Mayor Taylor: DO I INFER THAT THE AMENDMENT IS FRIENDLY TO THE BODY? THANK YOU. THE AMENDMENT IS ADOPTED. FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN MOTION AS AMENDED. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:37:47.943: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENT. I APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT THE CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE IS PUTTING INTO THIS. I WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE ISSUES WITH THE ABILITY TO SPEAK FREELY AND INSIDE PUBLIC VENUES. AGAIN, I BELIEVE THESE NEW RULES, PART OF THEM HAVE ISSUES WITH VIEW POINT DISCRIMINATION AND I BELIEVE IT -- IT HAS A CHILLING EFFECT ON THE POLITICAL MINORITY AND THE DISSENTING OPINION. AND THE NEXT STEPS WOULD THEN TO BE TO CHALLENGE THESE NEW RULES ONCE THAT OPPORTUNITY PRESENTS ITSELF.
01:38:40.095: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? I LOCK FORWARD TO THE RECEIPT OF THE ATTORNEY'S OFFICE PUBLIC MENUS. IT'S THE REPORT OF THING THAT WE HAVE BEEN LONG CONTEMPLATING AND I'M GLAD IT'S MOVING FORWARD. NO ONE FROM ACLU HAS COMMUNICATED WITH ME WITH RESPECT TO THE RULES. IF IT COMES TO PASS THAT WE AS A BODY WANT TO CHANGE THE RULES IN RESPONSE TO EXTERNAL FEEDBACK OR INTERNAL FEEDBACK, WELL, YOU KNOW, THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ARE WELL WITHIN OUR RIGHTS TO DO AND I -- -- WE ARE PUTTING SOMETHING TOGETHER THAT'S ITERATIVE HERE. I DON'T THINK ANYONE WILL GO TO THE WALL ON THIS UP WITH. FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN MOTION AS AMENDED? ALL IN FAVOR? OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. DC-2, Resolution Requesting an Evaluation of the Feasibility of a Revised Development for 2857 Packard Road. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER RADINA AND SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRAND. DISCUSSION, PLEASE OF DC-2. COUNCILMEMBER RADINA.
01:39:52.834: >> Councilmember Radina: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR AND I WANTED TO BRIEFLY THANK STAFF, DEREK DELACOURT, AND KEVIN McDONALD AND STEVEN POSTEMA FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS. ULTIMATELY, I THINK MOST OF YOU KNOW THE HISTORY OF 2857 PACKARD. WE'RE CURRENTLY UNDER A CONSENT JUDGMENT IN THE SITE PLAN THERE. IN ORDER FOR ANOTHER ALTERNATIVE DEVELOPMENT TO BE CONSIDERED, IT WOULD REQUIRE THE CONSENT JUDGMENT TO BE REOPENED BUT IT WOULD REQUIRE OUR STAFF TO GO THROUGH THE NORMAL PROCESS OF WORKING WITH PROPERTY OWNER AND DEVELOPER TO ULTIMATELY CONSIDER FOR THE FUTURE OF THIS PROJECT. IT'S MEANT TO BROADLY EMPOWER STAFF TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS. AS I UNDERSTAND IT, THE PREVIOUS DEVELOPER IS NO LONGER IN -- IN THE PROCESS OF PLANS TO DEVELOP THIS SITE, AND SO THE PROPERTY OWNER IS INTERESTED IN WORKING WITH OTHERS TO POTENTIALLY DEVELOP IT. AND SO THIS RESOLUTION WOULD MOVE US TOWARDS THAT. I WOULD LIKE TO CLARIFY THAT THERE'S CURRENTLY NOT A PROPOSAL BEFORE COUNCIL OR THE CITY SPECIFICALLY FOR US TO APPROVE. THIS WOULD JUST BEGIN THAT PROCESS. AND SO -- SO DO WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT THAT, THAT WHILE THERE IS, I THINK, ABSOLUTELY A PROPOSAL THAT IS BEING TALKED ABOUT IN THE COMMUNITY, THAT PROPOSAL HAS NOT FORMALLY BEEN BROUGHT TO THE CITY AT THIS TIME. THANKS.
01:41:37.639: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
01:41:39.240: >> Councilmember Hayner:  WELL THANKS, MR. MAYOR. MY ONLY CONSIDERATION AROUND THIS RESOLUTION, I WONDER IF WE SHOULD ADD A DATE CERTAIN, FOR MR. CRAWFORD OR THE LEGAL STAFF WOULD LIKE TO OPINE ON WHAT A DATE MIGHT BE TO PUT SOME OF THIS TO GO, I THINK IT WOULD BE NICE TO PUT A DATE IN HERE. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS TO HAVE DATES ON THEM. YOU KNOW, I FULLY SUPPORT THE NOTION OF THIS. I THINK ANY OPPORTUNITY TO MEET OUR COMMUNITY GOALS IS AN IMPORTANT TIME. I HAD THE PLEASURE OF TOURING THIS SITE. THEY HAD A V.R. SITE GOING. COULD WALK AROUND AND SEE THE BUILDING IN THE OPEN SPACE AND THE RELATIONSHIP AND THE OPPORTUNITY FOR PARKS PATHING AND SO ON. IT'S AN INTERESTING IDEA, AND SO WOULD ANYBODY -- WOULD WE BE INTERESTED IN PUTTING A DATE FOR THAT TO COME BACK? I DON'T WANT TO PUSH ANYBODY ON THIS? WITH REAL ESTATE, I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO LET FOLKS KNOW THAT WE ARE SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING THIS.
01:42:53.181: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. CRAWFORD, PERHAPS YOU CAN PROVIDE SOME COMFORT AS TO YOUR --
01:42:57.118: >> City Admin. Crawford: YES, MAYOR, I WAS GOING TO -- MR. DELACOURT IS ACTUALLY THE ONE THAT'S OUR LEAD ON THIS AND I WOULD ASK THAT HE COMMENT ON THAT AND PERHAPS MR. POSTEMA.
01:43:07.195: >> I WOULD BE GLAD TO COMMENT. I MEAN,  OBVIOUSLY WE AS STAFF WOE DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH A DEADLINE. WE CAN GIVE COUNCIL AN UPDATE AS SOON AS THEY FEEL IT'S RELEVANT. I'M NOT SURE IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT STAFF WILL BE COMFORTABLE TO RECOMMEND AS A FRAMEWORK TO MOVE FORWARD. SO WE WILL CERTAINLY -- I BELIEVE THE PROPERTY OWNER AND THE GROUP THAT AT LEAST IS INTERESTED IN RIGHT NOW IS, OF COURSE, IN -- I WOULDN'T SAY A RUSH, BUT TIME IS ALWAYS AN ISSUE. WE CAN COME BACK WHENEVER COUNCIL WANTS BUT WE MAY NOT HAVE SOMETHING THAT STAFF IS COMFORTABLE TO RECOMMEND AT THAT POINT. CERTAINLY AN UPDATE AT ANY POINT, THAT'S FINE WITH US. WE CAN GIVE YOU AN UPDATE ON OUR PROGRESS AND WHERE WE STAND AND IF THERE'S ANY MAJOR STICKING POINTS AT THAT POINT THAT COUNCIL MAY WANT TO OPINE.
01:44:06.154: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I'M HAPPY TO LET IT BE THEN. I SUPPORT THIS NOTION THAT WE ARE ASKING FOR SOME DEVICE TO POTENTIALLY MOVE FORWARD. I WAS HAPPILY SUPPORTED COUNCILWOMAN BANNISTER AND HER EFFORTS TO TRY TO SAVE SOME OF THIS PARCEL AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE OUR PLANNING COMMISSION TO RECONSIDER -- OR EVALUATE THE TYPES OF PLANNING THAT TOOK A SITE LIKE THIS AND DIDN'T ALLOW FOR AN INTERESTING OPPORTUNITY LIKE IS NOW WITH THE THRIVE CONCEPT. I THINK WE HAD SOME R1E ON THERE, WHICH IS NOT REALLY CARRYING ITS WEIGHT AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED. THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS WE CAN LOOK AT BUT TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO SORT OF A PROJECT --
01:45:00.274: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMAN.
01:45:00.875: >> Councilmember Hayner:  THAT WE ADDRESS TO OTHER PEOPLE AND OTHER COMMUNITIES IS IMPORTANT.
01:45:05.146: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND?
01:45:16.023: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. I WAS NOT SUPPORTIVE TO SPEND ALMOST ALL OF THE PARK ADVISORY'S ACQUISITION FUNDS ON ONE PIECE OF PROPERTY IN A PRIOR ITERATION OF THIS, G BUT THIS IA DIFFERENT KIND OF OPPORTUNITY. I JUST WANT TO THANK ALL OF THE NEIGHBORS AND RESIDENTS WHO REACHED TO US, WHO ASKED GREAT QUESTIONS AND SHOWN A WILLINGNESS TO THINK DIFFERENTLY, AND TO, YOU KNOW, POTENTIALLY EMBRACE SOME DIFFERENT KINDS OF HOUSING, WHICH I THINK IS TERRIFIC, TO THINK ABOUT HOUSING ALONG A TRANSIT CORRIDOR AND TO INCLUDE THIS PIECE OF PROPERTY IN THAT CONVERSATION, I THINK IS REALLY EXCITING. THIS IS MAYBE ONE OF THE MOST COMPLEX SITES I HAVE EVER ENCOUNTERED ON COUNCIL. SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE GET MORE INFORMATION. I WANT TO THANK COUNCILWOMAN GRISWOLD TO BRING THIS FORWARD AND SO WE CAN GET A COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF THE -- OF THE PROS, CONS, TRADEOFFS, THE INFORMATION THAT WE NEED TO REALLY LOOK AT WHAT IS EXCITING AND COMPLEX. AND WHENEVER ANYTHING IS EXCITING AND COMPLEX, THERE ARE THINGS THAT CAN BE MISSED. AND I THINK IT WILL HELP US CLARIFY WHAT IT CAN BE AND WHAT IT CAN'T BE, AND TO MAKE -- TO EVENTUALLY MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION THAT'S -- THAT'S FAIR TO EVERYONE. SO THANK YOU SO MUCH TO STAFF AND THANK YOU TO COUNCILMEMBER RADINA.
01:47:14.942: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:47:15.810: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I MOVE TO STRIKE THE THIRD WHEREAS CLAUSE IN THIS RESOLUTION. I ASK AN AGENDA QUESTIO OF WHAT OTHER DEVELOPERS ARE ASKING ENGAGED WITH MR. WEBER AND I WAS TOLD THAT THRIVES THE ONLY ONE AT THIS TIME, OR SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT. I THINK THIS  GIVES BIASNESS, AD I THINK WE SHOULD OFFER THIS TO ANYBODY WOULD CAN MANAGE TO ACHIEVE THE GOALS THAT ARE SET OUT BY THIS RESOLUTION. I JUST THINK THIS KIND OF GIVES ONE -- ONE DEVELOPER A INSIDE TRACK, PERHAPS TYPE OF REFERENCE. I WOULD LIKE TO STRIKE IT.
01:48:04.992: >> Mayoraylor: IS THERE A SEND?
01:48:09.363: >> Councilmeer Grand: I WOULD OFFER LIKE A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT ALTERNATIVE AND SEE IF THAT'S FRIENDLY, IF THAT'S OKA

01:48:25.880: >> Mayor Taylor: WE NOW HAVE A SECOND ON COUNCILMEMBER RADINA. IN THE QUEUE WE HAVE GRISWOLD -- WOULD YOU MIND IF COUNCILMEMBER GRAND GOES TO MOVE THIS ALONG QUICKLY? COUNCILMEMBER GRAND?
01:48:41.095: >> Councilmember Grand: I THINK IF WE JUST STRIKE THE INCLUDING THRIVE COLLABORATIVE. SO IF WE JUST SAY, WHEREAS MR. WEBER IS NOW WORKING WITH ALTERNATIVE DEVELOPERS AND IS PURSUING AN ALTERNATIVE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SITE, I THINK THAT OPEN -- I TNK IT -- THAT THE INCLUDING WAS MEANT TO BE INCLUSIVE BUT MAYBE THAT'S -- I TOLLY UNDERSTAND THAT PEPECTIVE.
01:49:04.785: >> Mayoraylor: IS THAT FRIENDLYO THE COD ALL RIG. SO I WILL TAKE TT AS AN AMENDMENT TOHE AMENDMENT. D THEN I WILL TAKEHAT AMENDMENT -- THA ANDED AMENDMENT A FRIENDLY. EXCELLENT.HAPP WITH THAT THIS MS. AUDRY, DO Y HAVE THA THANK YOU. COUNCILMBER GRISWOLD?

01:50:06.147: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:50:07.048: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  IS THIS ON THE MAIN MOTION AT THIS POINT?
01:50:09.283: >> Mayor Taylor: YES, IT IS.
01:50:09.884: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: BACK TO HAVING A DATE -- ASKING REQUESTING A DATE, I THINK BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE WITH THIS, THAT THIS PROPERTY OWNER IS QUITE FRUSTRATED. HE'S SPENT, M, MANY, MANY YEARS TRYING TO DO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS AND HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO BE SUCCESSFUL AT ANY OF THEM. SO UNFORTUNATELY FOR HIS INTERESTS. PERHAPS FORTUNATE FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO PRESERVE OUR NATURAL FEATURES THOUGH. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE INDICATE IN SOME SHAPE OR FORM THE DATE CERTAIN THAT THIS RECOMMENDATION COMES BACK. I DON'T THINK THE SELLER IS GOING TO BE THAT PATIENT WITH US. I THINK WE NEED TO MOVE ON THIS IF WE HAVE A GOOD CHANCE OF SUCCEEDING. I THINK 30 DAYS, 60 DAYS, I DON'T KNOW WHAT STAFF IS COMFORTABLE.
01:51:13.380: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. CRAWFORD?
01:51:14.014: >> City Admin. Crawford: I WOULD SUGGEST NO THE TO EXSOLDIER EX D 90 DAYS. IT WOULD ALLOW STAFF TO WORK ON IT FOR 60 DAYS AND THEN GET IT ON YOUR CALENDAR IN 60 TO 70 DAYS. THAT WOULD BE MY SUGGESTION.
01:51:34.335: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  60 DAYS GIVE US MAY 1st?
01:51:37.304: >> City Admin. Crawford: I WAS SUGGESTING 90. THAT GIVES THEM ENOUGH TIME TO HAVE NEGOTIATIONS AND GET IT ON INYOUR AGENDA.
01:51:46.013: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: NEGOTIATIONS WITH WHO?
01:51:49.683: >> City Admin. Crawford: TO WORK THROUGH THE ISSUES WITH THE PROPERTY OWNER AND WHOMEVER HE CHOOSES.
01:51:54.188: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  IF THAT'S WHAT YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH. I DON'T WANT TO PUT YOU IN AN UNCOMFORTABLE POSITION TO FAIL IN.
01:52:01.695: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THAT FRIENDLY TO THE BODY? IS THAT A KNOW FROM COUNCILMEMBER RADINA? YOU ARE ON MUTE.
01:52:16.377: >> Councilmember Radina: SORRY. I ACTUALLY HAVE A QUESTION FOR MR. DELACOURT ON IT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PROCESS IS WITHOUT IT -- I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S BEEN A SECOND.
01:52:37.264: >> Mayor Taylor: I WAS GOING TO GET TO THAT. RATHER THAN HAVING THIS BE SOMETHING FORMAL. MR. CRAWFORD IS HERE AND MR. DELACOURT IS HERE, THEY TOLD US THEY WILL GET BACK TO US IN 90 DAYS. IS THAT GOOD ENOUGH?
01:52:49.944: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: IT'S THE SPONSORS OF THE RESOLUTION.
01:52:59.720: >> Councilmember Radina: MAYBE IF YOU YOU ALLOW ME A COURTESY. WE WANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE DON'T OWN THE PROPERTY AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF SPESES OF THIS THAT WOULD BE DEPENDENT ON OUTSIDE ACTORS TAKING ACTION IN ORDER FOR US TO FIT WITHIN THAT WINDOW AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT STAFF IS COMFORTABLE THAT WE ARE NOT PUTTING OURSELVES IN AN INFLEXIBLE POSITION THAT MIGHT PROVIDE LEVERAGE TO OUTSIDE INDIVIDUALS.
01:53:28.749: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESUMED FLEXIBILITY ON THIS. MR. DELL AC DELACOURT, DO YOU WO POP IN?
01:53:38.359: >> I'M SURE IF THERE'S ANYTHING HERE OF SUBSTANCE WITH THIS CURRENT UPON PURCHASER OF THE PROPERTY AND MR. WEBER, I WOULD SUSPECT THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO PUT TOGETHER SOME TYPE OF REASONABLE UPDATE IN A 90-DAY TIME FRAME AND GET THAT BACK TO COUNCIL. THAT WILL NOT BE THE LAST ACTION ON THE PROPERTY. STAFF WILL COME BACK AND SAY, WE BELIEVE THERE'S SUBSTANCE HERE. THERE IS THE OUTLINE OR THE FRAMEWORK OF A REVISED CONSENT JUDGMENT THAT WE THINK THAT COUNCIL CAN CONSIDER. THESE ARE THE PRIMARY POINTS OF THAT. THESE ARE THE ISSUES WE NEED INPUT FROM COUNCIL AND ASK YOU, BASED ON THIS OUTLINE, DO YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE GOING FORWARD AND SINNING THAT CONVERSATION, AND AT THAT TIME, IT MAY BE A MORE FORMAL REQUEST TO ENGAGE WELL CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE IN BRINGING BACK A REVISED CONSENT JUDGMENT. I THINK 90 DAYS IS FINE TO PUT THAT FRAMEWORK TOGETHER FROM US. IF THERE IS F VAL IS VALUE IN T. I HEAR MR. RAMLAWI'S CONCERN. HE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF THERE'S SERIOUSNESS IN THIS ATTEMPT WITH THE DEVELOPER AND I BELIEVE EVERYONE IS MOST ELEVATORS TO GET BACK WITHIN THAT TIME -- MOTIVATED TO GET BACK WITHIN THAT TIME FRAME. WE CAN COME BACK AND SAY THIS HAS BEEN A BUST AND THERE'S NOTHING HERE, AND MR. WEBER CAN GO ON AND PURSUE THIS DEVELOPMENT WITH WHATEVER DEVELOPMENT GROUP HE WISHES AND WE MAY BE BACK HERE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE WITH A DIFFERENT DEVELOPMENT GROUP. THE DIFFERENCE HERE IS BECAUSE OF THE CONSENT AGREEMENT, WE ARE NOT COMFORTABLE GOING THROUGH THE N NORMAL DISCUSSION WITHOUT INCLUDING COUNCIL, THAT WE ARE PURSUING.
01:55:26.433: >> Mayor Taylor: I'M HEARING STAFF IS GETTING BACK TO US IN 90 DAYS.
01:55:30.137: >> VERY LONG WAY OF PUTTING IT, MAYOR. THANK YOU.
01:55:34.475: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS.
01:55:35.943: >> Councilmember Briggs: YES, REAL BRIEFLY. EXCITED TO SEE US CONSIDERING THAT JUDGMENT THIS EVENING SINCE I WAS SERVING ON PLANNING COMMISSION AT THE TIME THAT THIS WENT THROUGH. I JUST WANTED TO NOTE HOW MUCH PLANNING COMMISSION AND STAFF HAVE WORKED TO PRESERVE THE LANDMARK TREES AND COMMISSIONER SHANNAN GIBB-RANDALL MADE SURE THAT THERE WAS APPROPRIATE LANGUAGE. SO STAFF HAS DONE A GREAT DEAL OF WORK ON THIS. I'M GLAD TO SEE THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY POTENTIALLY TO WORK FOR MUCH IMPROVED CONSENT JUDGMENT POTENTIALLY. FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN MOTION? OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. DC-3. Resolution Establishing the Fee to Cover the Cost of Annual Investigation And Review of On-Premises Liquor Licenses for 2021. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, AND SECONDED BY DISCH. DISCUSSION OF DC-4. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
01:56:39.373: >> Councilmember Hayner: WELL, THANKS, MR. MAYOR. THIS COMES OUT OF LIQUOR LICENSE REVIEW BOARD. WE DO AN ANNUAL REQUEST FOR RENEWAL OF LIQUOR LICENSES HERE IN TOWN AND IT'S IT'S MANDATED BY THE STATE THAT WE DO THIS REVIEW. THE STATE AUTOMATICALLY REVIEWS LICENSES IF THERE'S NO NEGATIVE REPORT FROM THE CITY OR THE LICENSE HOLDER IN THIS CASE, AND THAT'S WHAT WILL HAPPEN HERE, BUT WHAT HAPPENED IS WE SET ASIDE THE -- SENDING OUT THE LETTER BECAUSE UNCERTAINTIES AROUND COVID AND THE ABILITY OF PLACES TO OPEN AND SO ON. AND SO KIND OF HAD A WIDE RANGING DISCUSSION IN OUR FIRST LIQUOR LICENSE REVIEW BOARD MEETING OF THE YEAR AND WE THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE NICE TO CUT THE FEE FOR THESE FOLKS. I KNOW IT'S A TOKEN GESTURE IN THIS CASE. IT CAN'T REFLECT THE COST OF SERVICE TO THE CITY BY PROVIDING THIS. THE OLD FEE WAS $90 AND THIS IS ASKING THAT WE CUT IT DOWN BEFORE $50. THE WAY THE ORDINANCE IS PRINCIPLE, WE HAVE TO ASK THE BODY TO SET THE FEE. THE BODY DOES ESTABLISH THE FEE FOR THESE LICENSES. THAT BODY BEING CITY COUNCIL. AND SO FOR THIS IS OPPORTUNITY,R THIS YEAR, I'M ASKING COUNCIL TO JOIN US IN REDUCING THE FEE SOMEWHAT AS SORT OF A GESTURE TO THESE BUSINESS OWNERS WHO HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING IN THESE TIMES. WE CAN'T LEAVE IT FULLY BUT WE DETERMINED THAT WASN'T REALLY THE BEST COURSE EITHER. I RECOGNIZE THAT THE DIFFERENCE IS SMALL TO A LARGE BUSINESS AND YET WE FEEL IT'S APPROPRIATE OR I CAN SPEAK FOR MYSELF AND SAY I DID. SO THAT'S WHERE THIS IS COMING FROM. THANK YOU.
01:58:32.886: >> Mayor Taylor: DOWN SILLCOUNCR DISCH.
01:58:38.492: >> Councilmember Disch: MY COLLEAGUE IN WARD ONE COVERED THIS PRETTY WELL. BUT JUST TO MENTION THAT THE CURRENT FEE IS $90 AND THAT DOES REFLECT WHAT IT COSTS THE CITY TO CONDUCT THIS VERIDIAN VIEW. WE ARE PROPOSING TO ROLL THIS BACK TO THE PREVIOUS FEE AMOUNT WHICH WAS $50 WHICH NO LONGER COVERS EVERYTHING THAT THE CITY NEEDS TO DO, BUT IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT MANY PEOPLE DIDN'T EVEN GET TO MANY ESTABLISHMENTS DIDN'T GET TO USE THEIR LIQUOR LICENSE BECAUSE THEY WERE CLOSED AND MANY OF THEM DID NOT REOPEN, EVEN THOUGH THEY COULD OVER THE PAST YEAR, WE FELT IT JUST WOULD BE A NICE THING TO DO AND WE WERE INFORMED THAT BY -- BY MS. BEAUDRY THAT THE BUDGET CAN ABSORB THE LOSS THAT THIS WILL MEAN.
01:59:32.145: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:59:34.047: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THE SENTIMENT THAT HAS GONE INTO THE PROPOSED FEE REDUCTION HERE. I WAS ON THE LI LIQUOR LICENSE REVIEW BOARD FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS. WE FELT THE $90 WAS ACTUALLY TOO LO WE HAD DISCUSSIONS THAT THAT FEE WAS NOT RAISED IN MANY, MANY YEARS AND WE SHOULD LOOK AT RAISING THIS FEE FROM $90 TO SOMETHING CLOSER TO $100, $125. SO IT'S SURPRISINGHAT I SAW THIS THAT WE ARE GOING TO GO IN THE OTHER DIRECTION. IT'S NOT A BATTLE FOR ME TO FIGHT ON OR A HILL FOR ME TO DIE ON. I JUST THINK THAT HOPEFULLY WE DON'T THINK THAT THIS IS GOING TO SOLVE A LOT OF PROEMS FOR THESE SMALL BUSINESSES T. THEY GOT SOME HUGE PROBLEMS THEY WILL BE FACING AND I HOPE THIS 40S PER RENEWAL DOESN'T CAUSE SOME DIFFICULTIES IN OUR OWN OPERATIONS AND SOMEHOW WE SUBSIDIZE THE COST OF ADMINISTERING THESE SO IF I CAN HAVE SOME REASSURANCES. I WONDER IF WE ARE GOING TO BE RESULT OF APPROVING THIM AS A RESOLUTION.
02:01:17.084: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. CRAWFORD.
02:01:17.718: >> City Admin. Crawford:AT THESE DOLLAR AMOUNTS. THESE ARE ALL FIXED CTS FOR THE CITY A THERE'S NOT MUCH FSET.
02:01:28.295: >>ouncilmemberamlawi:  SO HOW DIDE GETO THE $90 FEE. IAW JACKIEAISEER HAN
02:01:33.800: >> Cle Beaudry: IFT WASN'T CLEAR, I THINK CNCILMEMBER HAYNER SAI THIS BUT T RESOLUTI IS CLEAR THAT THIS IS JU ANE-YEAR REDUCON. D THE ANTIPATION IS THAT NEXT YEAR WWILL RETURN TO THE 0.
02:01:49.449: >> Cncilmeer Ramlawi ANDING. BYHARGG JUST $5 ARE W ABRBINGNYOS? E WE CRGING LS THAN WHAT IT CTS US TO ADMINISTE THIS?
02:02:02.662: >> Clerk Beaudry: THE $90 WAS BASED ON A COST ANALYSIS OF THE CLERK'S OFFICE WORK WE WOULD STILL CHARGE IF OTHER DEPARTMENTS DID INSPECTIONS OR OTHER WORK LIKE BUILDING OR FIRE DEPARTMENT, BUT THE 90 COVERS THE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS OF THE CLERK'S OFFICE ADMINISTERING THE ANNUAL PROGRAM.
02:02:25.385: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I FEEL LIKE WE SHOULD BE CONSISTENT AND PRINCIPLED AND I DON'T SEE -- I CAN'T SUPPORT A REDUCTION IN THIS. IF IT COSTS $90 TO ADMINISTER IT, THEN THAT'S WHAT WE SHOULD BE CHARGING. WE ARE NOT REDUCING COSTS FOR OTHER ISSUES PEOPLE ARE HAVING. I'M SORRY, I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS.
02:02:43.870: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER. I LOVE -- MR. MAYOR, I LOVE HOW IT SAYS COUNCILMEMBER HEY NOW IN OUR TRANSCRIPT. IT'S WORKING PRETTY WELL, THOUGH. I'M NOT GOING TO GO CRAZY ARGUING ABOUT THIS. THE $90 IF I RECALL FROM THE NOWS CAME FROM THIS NOTION WHERE SOMETIMES -- SOMETIMES FOLKS DON'T PAY OR WE HAVE THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO GO BACK AND FORTH AND CHASE THE LETTERS AND SO IT WAS AN AVERAGE ACROSS THE $243 LICENSES THAT WE HOLD WAS WHERE THE $90 CAME UP TO AND I DON'T THINK WE ARE TAKING A BIG HIT ON DOING THIS AND BELIEVE ME, IF I THOUGHT IT WAS IN OUR BUDGET, I WOULD DO ALL SORTS OF THINGS TO ELIMINATE THE WOES OF THESE DOWNTOWN BUSINESSES AND WE COULD START WITH WAIVING SOME OF THESE PARKING FEES FOR SOME OF THE PRIME SPOTS IN THE PARKING STRUCTURES. I TALKED TO A LOT OF -- WELL, NOT A LOT BUT MORE THAN A HANDFUL OF BAR OWNERS AROUND THIS MATTER. SOME SAID THEY APPRECIATED THE GESTURE AND SOME SAID THEY WOULD LIKE IT TO BE FEE BUT EITHER SAID THEY COULD AFFORD IT EITHER WAY. THIS IS JUST A NOTION THAT, YOU KNOW, WE ARE JUST TRYING TO DO SOMETHING NICE FOR THESE FOLKS AND PERHAPS WE COULD. I THINK IT REPRESENTS AROUND $9,000 WORTH OF TONIGHT DIFFERENCE IN THESE TOO -- OF POTENTIAL DIFFERENCE IN THESE FEES. AGAIN, I THINK IT'S ABOUT 243 LICENSES IN THE CITY. SO IT'S UP TO YOU FOLKS. I'M GOING TO SUPPORT IT.
02:04:07.153: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
02:04:14.327: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES.
02:04:18.865: >> Councilmember Disch: YES.

02:04:38.652: >> Councilmember Briggs: YES.
02:04:39.452: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  NO.
02:04:41.154: >> Clerk Beaudry: THE MOTION CARRIES.
02:04:46.192: >> Mayor Taylor: LET'S TAKE A BREAK. WE'LL SEE YOU AGAIN AT 9:15. [ BREAK ]
02:14:59.938: >> Mayor Taylor: WE ARE BACK AFTER A SHORT BREAK. DC-4 Resolution to Award a 5-Year Service Contract to Recycle Ann Arbor for the Residential Customer Recyclables Collections (estimated $7,039,862.40) with City Option for one 2-Year Extension. ESTIMATE TO BE IN THE AMOUNT OF $3,043,149.60. MOVED BY DISCH AND SECONDED BY BRIGGS. DISCUSSION, PLEASE OF DC-4. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
02:15:38.411: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, MAYOR TAYLOR. THIS WAS ADDED LATE TO OUR AGENDA AND WE WEREN'T ABLE TO ASK QUESTIONS BY OUR DEADLINE. NOT THAT I HAVE STRONG OBJECTION TO THIS, BUT DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION TO GO ALONG WITH IT. I KNOW IT WAS A FOUR-MONTH TIME FRAME THAT STAFF TOOK WITH RECYCLE ANN ARBOR TO COME TO AN AGREEMENT. PERHAPS IF IT'S OKAY WITH MEMBERS OF THE BO BODY AND STAF, THEY COULD GIVE US A HIGHLIGHT VERSION OF THIS AGREEMENT. WHAT WERE THE ISSUES THAT TOOK SO LONG TO RESOLVE, IF WE COULD GET AN EXECUTIVE SYNOPSIS.
02:16:33.899: >> City Admin. Crawford: WE HAVE MOLLY MAJEWSKI.
02:16:38.671: >> I DO. WE WERE HOPING TO HAVE EILEEN NAPLES ON. JACKIE, I'M NOT SURE IF WE CAN GET HER ON.
02:17:00.960: >> Clerk Beaudry: I JUST MOVED HER OVER.
02:17:02.595: >> SHE WAS OUR LEAD AND SHE'S ON NOW.
02:17:05.097: >> HI, MOLLY AND EVERYONE. GOOD EVENING, THIS IS EILEEN AND I WAS JUST READDED. SO MOLLY, I MISSED EVERYTHING YOU SAID LEADING UP TO I BELIEVE SHE'S ON NOW.
02:17:18.544: >> ACTUALLY, COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI WOULD LIKE TO HEAR ABOUT WHAT TOOK SO LONG AND I DON'T WANT SPEAK FOR YOU, COUNCILMEMBER. I WILL LET YOU REPEAT.
02:17:25.818: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: IT'S ALL RIGHT. I APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE, EILEEN TO ANSWER THESE HIGH LEVEL QUESTIONS IN TERMS OF WHAT WERE THE STICKY POINTS THAT TOOK FOUR MONTHS TO RESOLVE? WHAT ARE THE ISSUES? AND WHAT ARE OUTSTANSTANDING IS? WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT PERHAPS WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT THE NEXT TIME THIS UP FOR RENEWAL. WE DIDN'T GET THIS UNTIL LATE FRIDAY, AND WE DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO SUBMIT QUESTIONS UNFORTUNATELY FOR WRITTEN RESPONSES.
02:17:55.848: >> ABSOLUTELY AND I KNOW WE ARE ALL HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE TONIGHT AND TO MOVE FORWARD. TO SUMMARIZE, I DID TAKE SOME TIME. THIS R.A. SUBMITTED THE LOWEST BID THAT MET ALL THE CITY'S I.T.B. REQUIREMENTS BACK IN JULY OF 2020. FOLLOWING THEIR BID SUBMISSION, THEY DID PROPOSE A NUMBER OF POTENTIAL EDITS AND ALSO QUESTIONS, LARGELY OPERATIONAL QUESTIONS ABOUT THE I.T.B. DOCUMENT. THE CITY TOOK SOME TIME TO REVIEW BECAUSE IT WAS A SLIGHT DEVIATION. WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WAS IN THE INTEREST OF THE CITY. AND COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, YOU ASKED ABOUT SOME OF THE SPECIFIC ITEMS. I WOULD CHARACTERIZE THEM AS PRIMARILY IN TWO CAMPS. ONE WAS OPERATIONAL AND THE OTHER WAS LEGAL. THE LEGAL ISSUES FELL INTO CERTAIN DEFAULT CLAUSES. WE TOOK SOME TIME TO DISCUSS AND ULTIMATELY ADDED LANGUAGE THAT WAS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE CITY AND THE R.A.A. SOME OF THE OTHER ISSUES THAT CAME UP WERE CLARIFICATIONS AND CLARIFYING REGARDING INSTRUCTIONS AND THE CITY'S RIGHT TO DO WORKS AND CHANGES TO ROUTES AND WHAT CONSTITUTES A SINGLE FAMILY HOME THAT WOULD BE SERVICED INFORM THIS CONTRACT. SO WE SPENT A NUMBER OF MONTHS WORKING THROUGH THESE ISSUES IN DETAILS WITH R.A.A. AND AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, THERE ARE NO OUTSTANDING ISSUES TO DISCUSS.
02:19:50.696: >> THE UPCOMING ISSUES THAT YOU WILL BE FACING DURING THE NEGOTIATIONS, THE PURCHASE OF THE COST THAT R. A.A. WILL HAVE TO PURCHASE ESCALATED SUBSTANTIALLY AND THEY WILL BE IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING A CHANGE ORDER TO ADJUST THEIR COSTS FOR TRUCK.
02:20:15.287: >> SO THAT WILL COME AT THE NEXT MEETING IS OUR INTENT.
02:20:18.491: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU.
02:20:19.592: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS.
02:20:28.133: >> Councilmember Briggs: I DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. ONE OF YOU WHO WAS PEPPERING WITH QUESTIONS IN ON RECYCLING. THANKS TO STAFF AND I'M EXCITED TO BE VOTING ON IT TONIGHT.
02:20:47.720: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
02:20:48.687: >> Councilmember Hayner:  THE FIRST SEGMENT WAS $2.5 MILLION BELOW THE NEXT BIDDER AND OVER THE TOTAL LIFE OF THE CONTRACT, IT WAS ABOUT 3.5 MILLION BELOW THE NEXT CLOSEST BIDDER. ARE -- COULD -- I GUESS TWO THINGS -- THREE THINGS. SO ARE THERE ANY HIDDEN COSTS NOT SHOWN IN THAT COST. MY QUESTION HAS BEEN PERPETUALLY BEEN, WHO OWNS AND SERVICES THE VEHICLES? THAT'S FIRST ONE. THE SECOND ONE S IS SINCE THIS RECYCLING IS THERE A SHARE BUYBACK IS INSULATES THE CITY AS THE COST OF THE RECYCLABLES GOES UP AND DOWN, THE REAL ESTATE MATERIALS THAT -- THE RAW MATERIALS THAT WE ARE SELLING. AND WHAT IS THE CHANGE ORDER THAT WILL COME BACK? WILL IT STILL TURN OUT THAT IT'S ABOVE THE THREE PLUS OUR OWN CONSIDERATION? THANK YOU.
02:21:43.008: >> SO I WILL ADDRESS YOUR FIRST QUESTION WHICH IS THE TRUCKS. RECYCLE ANN ARBOR WILL BE FURNISHING TRUCKS, INCLUDING IT MANMAINTENANCE AND FUEL AND EVERYTHING LIKE THAT.
02:21:56.689: >> THE SECOND ITEM ABOUT THE BACK END, THAT'S A MRF CONTRACT. THE MRF CONTRACT CONTAINS THE SALE OF RECOVERABLES. THAT'S NOT IN THIS CONTRACT.
02:22:15.674: >> THIS IS EILEEN. I APOLOGIZE, I NO LONGER HAVE A FUNCTIONING CAMERA, BUT I WILL JUMP IN ON THE THIRD QUESTION, WHAT IS THE CHANGE UNDER THE CONTRACT THAT WE CAN EXPECT FOR THE INCREASE IN THE PRICE, AND IS IT STILL LOWER THAN THE NEXT LOWEST BIDDER. WE WILL COME TO THE MARCH 15th E PRICE MOMENT TO YOU. I WILL SPEAK TO THE SPECIFICS AS WE GET DOCUMENTS READY FOR THAT. THE CHANGE IN PRICE IS STILL LOWER THAN THE NEXT LOWEST LOWET BIDDER. HAD A.
02:22:57.549: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANKS FOR ANSWERING THESE QUESTIONS.
02:23:01.353: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN MENU. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
02:23:04.990: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANKS FOR ASKING THOSE QUESTIONS, COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, ESPECIALLY ABOUT THE TRUCKS. WE WERE TOLD THAT R.A.A. WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT, BUT WE ARE GOING TO BE ASKED PERHAPS AT THE NEXT COUNCIL MEETING TO HELP PAY FOR IT. SO COULD SOMEONE PERHAPS BETTER EXPLAIN WHO OWNS THE TRUCKS AND WHO IS HELPING THE FINANCING?
02:23:32.184: >> THE DIFFERENCE IS JUST THAT FROM THE TIME THAT THEY GOT BUT IN THEIR ORIGINAL BID TO JULY OF 2020 AND THE TIME WHEN WE FINISHED OUR NEGOTIATIONS, THE PRICE TO PURCHASE TRUCKS IMPACTS COST FOR COLLECTION. SO THEY NEED TO MAKE, THEY COULDN'T ADJUST THE BID PRICES. THOSE BID PRICES WAS SET IN JULY.
02:23:55.574: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: COULD WE PERHAPS POSTPONE THIS CONTRACT SO WE CAN GET THOSE FIGURES INCLUDED IN THIS AND WE ARE NOT AMENDING THIS CONTRACT JUST ONLY TWO WEEKS AFTER IT WAS APPROVED?
02:24:08.454: >> IT IS CRITICAL TO HAVE THE CONTRACT AT THIS TIME SO THEY CAN ORDER THE TRUCKS. SO THAT THEY CAN HAVE THEM IN TIME TO START THE SERVICE. THE ISSUE WAS THAT THE NEGOTIATIONS TOOK THE FOUR TO FIVE MONTHS AND NOT THE NORMAL 90 DAYS THAT YOU WOULD EXPECT ON A BID. AND SO THEIR BID HOLD TIME WAS EXCEEDED AND THE MARKET COST OF THE TRUCKS WENT UP. SO WE ASKED FOR TIR DOCUMENTATION OF THE IN TRUCK VALUES AND THEY LIED US THE COST OF THE TRUCKS AT THE TIME OF THE BID AND WHEN THEY ARE NOW. WE ARE VERY COMFORTABLE WITH BRINGING AN AMENDMENT TO YOU. WILL THAT BE SPREAD OUT OVER THE FIVE YEARS OR THE SEVEN YEARS, IT'S A UNIT COST ADJUSTMENT A THEY WILL BE RECOVERING THE COST OF THE TRUCKS OVER THE LIFE OF THE CONTRACT.
02:25:14.386: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU.
02:25:17.055: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
02:25:18.223: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WOULD LIKE TO BE LISTED AS A COSPONSOR AND I WOULD LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE ALL. GOOD WORK THAT'S DONE BY RECYCLE ANN ARBOR AND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO RECYCLE AND DIVERT WASTE FROM OUR LAND SKILL. THANK YOU. -- LANDFILL. THANK YOU.
02:25:35.007: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. FOR MY PART, I'M TOO DELIGHTED TH THIS IS GOING TO MOVE FORWARD. I DO WANT TO THANK STAFF FOR ALL THE GOOD WORK THAT THEY HAVE DONE GETTING US TO THIS POINT. I WOULD LIKE TO, OF COURSE, TO THANK RECYCLE ANN ARBOR FOR ALL THE GOOD WORK THAT THEY DO AND THEIR COMMITMENT TO THE MISSION HERE. YOU KNOW, WE IN ANN ARBOR ARE SO FORTUNATE TO HAVE COMMUNITY MEMBERS, COMMUTY-GROWN ORGANIZATIS LIKE RECYCLE ANN ARBOR THAT ARE FOCUSED ON BEING A MISSI-DRIVEN ORGANIZATION KE OURSELVES BUT WITH RECYC ANN ARBO WITH THE PARTICULAR WORKINWITH THEMN TS T BE FURTHER DISCUSSION?
02:26:32.798: >> Councilmb Hayner:  I WOULDUST ASK IF  BECAUSE I DIDN ASK WRITTEN QUESTIO IS IT OKAY IF I DO -- WHO WOULD I ADDRESS AN R.F.I. TO IF I DID HAVE QUESTIONS AROUND THIS MATTER MOVING FORWARD? I SUPPORT THIS NOTION THAT WE NEED TO GET THIS CONTRACT IN PLACE. WHO DO I ADDRESS THEM TO?
02:26:53.051: >> MR. HUPY.
02:26:53.385: >> Councilmember Hayner: OKAY. IF YOU READ THROUGH THE CONTRACT DIFFERENT THINGS JUMP OUT AND I'M CONCERNED ABOUT PRICE PER TON AND HOW WE CAME TO THESE PRICES. I WILL SEND IT OFF. THANK YOU.
02:27:11.503: >> Mayor Taylor: ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED. IT IS APPROVED. DC-5, Resolution to Improve Winter Sidewalk Maintenance. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS AND SECONDED BY GRISWOLD. DISCUSSION OF DC-5. COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS.
02:27:27.085: >> Councilmember Briggs: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'M EXCITED TO BE INTRODUCING THIS RESOLUTION. WE TALKED ABOUT THIS AT OUR MARCH 1st CITY COUNCIL MEETING WITH THE RESOLUTION THAT WAS PRESENTED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD AND EYER AND IT WAS POSTPONED TO HAVE MORE COUNCIL FEEDBACK AND GET THE FEEDBACK OF THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION AND THEY TASKED ME WITH BRINGING A RESOLUTION BACK TO COUNCIL BY TONIGHT. SO SINCE THEN WE RECEIVED MORE INPUT FROM COUNCIL, THANKS TO THE RESOLUTION PRESENTED BY COUNCILMCOUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI AW BUDDY AND CITY STAFF AND TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION AND THIS RESOLUTION REFLECTS THEIR FEEDBACK. I WOULD LIKE TO JUST FOCUS MOSTLY WHAT WE SERVICES FROM THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION. THEY PUSHED BACK THE NEED FOR GREATER OBSERVATION AND POINTED TO THE IMPRESSIVE WORK OF THE PEDESTRIAN SAFETY AND ACCESS TASK FORCE IN 2015. AND THAT INCLUDED ROBUST COMMUNITY INPUT REGARDING PEDESTRIAN ACCESS IN THE WINTER. TRIED TO INCLUDE THAT IN THE WHEREAS CLASSES TO DOCUMENT THE HISTORY OF THAT WORK. THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION BELIEVES THE CITY NEEDS TO UNDERGO A PARADIGM SHIFT. IT URGES US TO MOVE AS SWIFTLY TOWARDS MUNICIPAL SNOW REMOVAL. THEY UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE BUDGET RESTRAINTS BUT STRESSES THAT THE STATUS QUO IS NOT ACCEPTABLE, WHERE RESIDENTS ARE FORCED TO WALK ON THE BUSY STREETS LIKE PACKARD WHEN THE SIDEWALKS ARE IMPASSABLE. IT LOOKS TO IMPROVE UPON THE CURRENT OPERATIONAL MATTER AND IT SEEKS TO PILOT SOME SOLUTIONS BY NEXT WINTER AND LAYS THE GROUND WORK FOR US TO CONSIDER THAT BIGGER QUESTION OF MUNICIPAL SNOW REMOVAL WHEN WE HAVE MORE DATA.
02:29:12.824: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. MAIN MOTION. COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
02:29:26.104: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WANT TO THANK COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS FOR BRINGING FORWARD THIS NEW AND IMPROVED RESOLUTION FROM THE ORIGINAL ONE. I ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THIS AND WHETHER THE D.D.A. IS PART OF THIS RESOLUTION OR WE MAINS A SEPARATE RESOLUTION I'M FLEXIBLE AND WOULD ACCEPT EITHER DECISION. I DID COMMIT AN AMENDMENT TO JACKIE EARLIER TODAY. AND JACKIE, WOULD YOU MIND SHARING THAT WITH COUNCIL? AND I CAN READ THE AMENDMENT. IT'S THE SECOND RESOLVE CLAUSE. CITY COUNCIL DIRECTS THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR FOLLOWING THE FEASIBILITY STUDY IN THE FIRST RESOLVE CLAUSE TO CONDUCT A SURVEY TO DETERMINE THE LEVEL OF COMMUNITY SUPPORT FOR MUNICIPAL SIDEWALK SNOW REMOVAL AND PREFERENCE FOR A FUNDING SOURCE SUCH AS A MILLAGE OR A USER FEE.
02:30:31.103: >> Mayor Taylor: I'M SORRY. IS THERE A SECOND? SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER DISCH. COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR. MY APOLOGIES.
02:30:40.112: >> Councilmember Griswold: OH, OKAY. I BELIEVE THAT THIS AMENDMENT IS IMPORTANT SO THAT WE ARE ABLE TO MANAGE EXPECTATIONS. PEOPLE ARE READING THIS RESOLUTION AND COMING UP WITH DIFFERENT CONCLUSIONS. IT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER TODAY THAT CALEB COLEMAN GAVE AN EXCELLENT PRESENTATION ABOUT EQUITABLE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AT THE LAST OPERATION COMMISSION AND SO I SEE -- LAST TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION AND SO I SEE A SURVEY AS BEING AN OPPORTUNITY TO APPLY SOME OF THE METHODOLOGY THAT KAYLA COLEMAN DESCRIBES AND TO LOOK AT OPPORTUNITIES AT A MORE GRANULAR LEVEL, AS WELL AS F FOCUSING ON EQUITY TO DETERMINE WHERE WE MIGHT WANT TO EXPAND OUR SIDEWALK SHOVELING BEING REALIZING THAT WE ARE IN A PAN TELETEPANDEMIC AND WE ARE FACINA BUDGET DEFICIT AND MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE IS TO IMPROVE PEDESTRIAN SAFETY AT THE LEAST ABOUT OF MONEY AND I SEE THAT BEING THE KNOW AND THE ICE RIDGES AT THE CLOT CROSSWALK RA. AND I WANT TO THANK TOM CRAWFORD AND CRAIG HUPY AND OTHER STAFF FOR ACTUALLY GOING OUT AND LOOKING AT THE ENVIRONMENT WHEN WE DID HAVE A SNOWFALL TO DETERMINE WHERE OUR CHALLENGES WERE. IN TERMS OF CROSSWALKS THAT WERE NOT POSSIBLE. I ALSO HAVE A QUESTION FOR MOLLY. MAY I ASK A QUESTION.
02:32:33.458: >> Mayor Taylor: IF YOU PLEASE.
02:32:35.026: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  HAS THAT AMENDMENT BEEN DISTRIBUTED? HAS IT BEEN SHARED WITH COUNCIL?
02:32:42.200: >> Mayor Taylor: YES. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI AND RADINA ON THE AMENDMENT.
02:32:46.438: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: WELL, I HAVEN'T SEEN ON THE AMENDMENT. I WILL PASS FOR NOW.
02:32:51.243: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RADINA.
02:32:52.611: >> Councilmember Radina: YES, I HAVE A QUESTION FOR COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD, POTENTIALLY. I'M READING THE AMENDMENT, AND SEE THAT IT READS THE SURVEY TO DETERMINE THE LEVEL OF SUPPORT FOR COMMUNITY SNOW REMOVAL. IS THIS A SURVEY TO GAUGE PUBLIC PREFERENCE FOR COMPREHENSIVE SNOW REMOVAL OR DIFFERENT TYPES OF -- WE HAVE LEARN THAT THERE'S DIFFERENT TYPES OF MUNICIPAL SNOW REMOVAL AND I WANT CLARIFICATION ON THE INTENT.
02:33:33.051: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES, I WAS PREF REFERRING TO COMPREHENSIVE AND I WOULD ACCEPT THAT AS A FRIENDLY AMENDMENT FOR THAT WORD.
02:33:44.095: >> Councilmember Radina: I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT, COMPREHENSIVE BEFORE SIDEWALK SNOW REMOVAL.
02:33:52.304: >> Mayor Taylor: OKAY. BEFORE I ASK IS THAT FRIENDLY TO THE BODY, I WILL OBSERVE THAT THE FIRST RESOLVE CLAUSE DOESN'T HAVE THE WORD "COMPREHENSIVE" IN IT AND I IF I THAT THERE'S PROBABLY A VIRTUE IN CONSISTENCY, THAT TO SAY THAT WHATEVER THE -- WHATEVER IS THE RESULT OF THE FIRST RESOLVE CLAUSES, ASSESSING FEASIBILITY AND PROPOSAL THAT THAT BE THE SUBJECT MATTER OF ANY SURVEY AND THAT IT'S -- THE -- THE AMENDMENT IS PROBABLY BEST LEFT WITHOUT COMPREHENSIVE BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW THE NATURE OF WHAT THE ULTIMATE PROPOSAL IS GOING TO BE IN THE FIRST RESOLVE CLAUSE. DOES THAT RING RIGHT WITH PEOPLE? DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY OBJECTION IF WE REMOVE THIS REFERENCE TO -- OR IF WE -- COUNCILMEMBER RADINA, I'M GOING TO DEEM THAT YOUR AMENDMENT HAS NOT BEEN SECONDED AND WHETHER YOU WILL WITHDRAW IT OR TALK ABOUT IT.
02:34:54.899: >> Councilmember Radina: I WILL WITHDRAW IT.
02:34:57.369: >> Mayor Taylor: DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY OBJECTION TO THAT SLEIGHT OF HAND? COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS?
02:35:11.483: >> Councilmember Briggs: I COMPLETELY THE SUPPORT THE IDEA OF GETTING SOME SORT OF COMMUNITY FEEDBACK BEFORE WE MOVE FORWARD WITH ANY SORT OF RECOMMENDATIONS SO I'M NOT OPPOSED TO THE IDEA OF COMMUNITY FEEDBACK. THE ONLY THING THAT I GUESS I RAISE JUST A QUESTION ABOUT RIGHT NOW BEFORE INCLUDING THAT FORMALLY WITH THIS RESOLUTION IS THAT WE'RE KIND OF TYING OURSELVES -- ARE YOU HEARING AN ECHO AS WELL? I'M SORRY. I WILL TRY TO -- SEE IF THAT -- SORRY ABOUT THE ECHO. I'M WORRIED ABOUT TYING OURSELVES TO A PARTICULAR COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY, AS CAME OUT OF THE EQUITABLE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT WORK THAT MS. COLEMAN HAS DONE. WE'RE NOT SURE EXACTLY WHERE WE'RE GETTING OUR EQUITABLE ENGAGEMENT RIGHT NOW IS IT FROM THE ONE-ON-ONE, FROM THE SURVEYS? JUST ALLOWING OUR COMMUNITY TO GET A LITTLE BIT MORE AS WE DO MORE WORK ON THAT WE MAY FIND A DIFFERENT STRATEGY OR A JOINT STRATEGY MIGHT BE A BETTER WAY TO GET SOME INFORMATION. SO I AGREE WE SHOULD DO THAT. I JUST WONDER ABOUT FORMALIZING THAT IN THIS RESOLUTION RIGHT NOW.
02:36:28.326: >> Mayor Taylor: WOULD THERE BE ANY OBJECTION TO -- TO HAVE I AFRIENDLY AMENDMENT  TO THE AMENDMENT, RATHER THAN TO CONDUCT THE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT PROCESS TO DETERMINE?
02:36:41.773: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES, THAT'S MUCH BETTER.
02:36:44.542: >> Mayor Taylor: COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT PROCESS. IS THAT FRIENDLY TO THE BODY? I WILL DEEM THAT TO BE MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS AND SECONDED AS COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD, JUST AS A MATTER OF PRO FOE KOHL. THAT'S FRIENDLY TO THE BODY. SO THE AMENDMENT TO THE AMENDMENT NOW READS -- THE AMENDMENT NOW READS RESOLVED CITY COUNCIL DIRECTS THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR THAT THE FIRST RESOLVE CLAUSE TO CONDUCT WHATEVER I JUST SAID, SOMETHING ABOUT COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT. TO DETERMINE THE LEVEL OF COMMUNITY SUPPORT FOR MUNICIPAL SIDSIDEWALK SNOW REMOVAL AND SO FORTH. IS THIS AMENDMENT FRIENDLY? NOT FRIENDLY. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
02:37:29.521: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THIS CAME TO US VERY LATE. SO WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO ASK QUESTIONS TO STAFF. I WILL GO BACK TO THAT LATER. MY CONCERN AS WE START GOING DOWN THIS PATH, IS FINANCIAL COSTS AND REALLY OPPORTUNITY COSTS FOR STAFF. WE ARE LOOKING AT TRYING TO PROGRAMS, THE CARBON NEUTRALITY GOALS OURFFORDABLEOUSING, OUR COVID RECOVERY, ECONOMIC SEGREGATION, AND WE HAVE A LOT OF CHALLENGES RIGHT NOW. THIS ONE DOESN'T RISE TO THE TOP. AND BEFORE WE START SPENDING KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY AND TIM WETO ARE GNG TO SPEND ON THIS GSE CHASE BECAUSE QUITE FRANKLY, I'M NOT HEARING VERY NY OF MY CONSTITUENTS AING F THE TYPE OF- WHAT THI RESOLUTIONS CALLINGOR. AND SOEFOREE START SPENDING MONE AND TIME, I WAN TO KN BE SPENDINGN THIS.OING TO AND, I'M SORRY WE GOTHIS AT 5: ON FRIDAY, ANDOLD TO -- YOUNOW,OMEP -- DEAL WITH AND I'M LE, YOUNOW WT, I WK O THE WEEKENDS AND I'M TRYING TO GET READY FOR EVERYTHING ELSE THAT WE'RE PREPARING TO DISCUSS THAT HAS BEEN ON THE AGENDA IN TIME. AND THIS WHOLE PROCESS HAS WITHIN STRANGE. I WANT TO KNOW BEFORE WE SPEND A DOLLAR, WHAT ARE WE SPENDING ON AND WHAT ARE WE GETTING BEFORE WE START SPENDING AND THROW GOOD MONEY AFTER BAD.
02:39:25.937: >> Mayor Taylor: ON THE AMENDMENT, COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
02:39:29.874: >> Mayor Ta.>> Councilmember Ra THAT'S ACTUALLY A QUESTION TO THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR OR SOMEBODY TO TELL ME HOW MUCH THIS IS GOING TO COST? I MEAN WHEN WE DO OUTREACH, WHEN WE SEND POSTCARDS THEY COST MONEY.
02:39:43.321: >> City Admin. Crawford: YEAH, I MEAN --
02:39:45.623: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. CRAWFORD.
02:39:46.290: >> City Admin. Crawford: THE AMENDMENT THAT WAS MADE, WE DO NOT HAVE AN ASSESSMENT OF THAT COST AT THIS TIME. THE PROCESS THAT WE WILL GO THROUGH, WE STILL NEED TO TALK ABOUT IF THIS PASSES. SO THIS WOULD BE STAFF WORK OVER SOME COMING MONTHS IN WHICH WE WOULD UNDERSTAND THAT COST BEFORE ANYTHING WOULD BE DONE.
02:40:07.078: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  SO WOULD WE SEE SOMETHING BEFORE ACTION WAS TAKEN? WHAT COSTS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH JUST PASSING THIS RESOLUTION IF IT WAS TO PASS?
02:40:18.556: >> City Admin. Crawford: I WOULD ANTICIPATE STAFF DEVELOPING SOME KIND OF PLAN OR PROPOSAL AND THEN HAVING AN IDEA THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO BE FLOATED WITH THE SURVEY IS WHAT I WOULD PRESUME. I WOULD SAY INPUT FROM COUNCIL IF THEY ARE INTERESTED IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION. IT WOULD MEAN SOME ACTION AFTERWARDS FOR CONSISTENCY ISSUES.
02:40:48.219: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
02:40:52.824: >> Councilmember Hayner:  ARE WE STILL SPEAKING TO THE AMENDMENT.
02:40:55.993: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD, DID I MISS -- DID YOU COME OFF THE QUEUE AND COME BACK ON THE QUEUE.
02:41:04.068: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WILL PASS ON THE AMENDMENT. I WANT TO SPEAK TO THE WHOLE.
02:41:09.407: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE ANYBODY ELSE WHO WANTS TO SPEAK ON THE AMENDMENT? COUNCILMEMBER RADINA.
02:41:16.080: >> Councilmember Radina: THIS IS MORE OF A REQUEST. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, I THINK YOU MAY BE THE SOURCE OF THE ECHO. IF COUNCILMEMBERS COULD MUTE WHEN WE ARE NOT SPEAKING.
02:41:34.665: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE AMENDMENT. COUNCILROLL CALL VOTE.
02:41:43.307: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES.
02:41:48.679: >> Councilmember Disch: YES.
02:41:49.280: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES.
02:41:55.686: >> Councilmember Song: YES.
02:41:58.055: >> Councilmember Grand: YES.
02:42:00.691: >> Councilmember Radina: YES.
02:42:03.795: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
02:42:05.496: >> Councilmember Eyer: YES.
02:42:06.097: >> Councilmember Nelson:  YES.
02:42:10.535: >> Councilmember Briggs: YES.
02:42:11.169: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES.
02:42:13.171: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION CARRIES.
02:42:18.843: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN MOTION. COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD. COUNCIL MEMBER, YOU ARE MUTED.
02:42:31.022: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I SEE THIS RESOLUTION AS WORKING TOWARDS OUR SUSTAINABILITY GOALS, OUR VISION ZERO GOALS AS WELL AS PROVIDING MORE ACCESSIBILITY FOR PERSONS WITH MOBILITY CHALLENGES. SO I REALLY SEE THIS AS AN INTEGRAL PART OF MANY OF OUR ONGOING OBJECTIVES.
02:43:20.238: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
02:43:21.105: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANKS, MR. MAYOR. JUST SOME GENERAL REMARKS ON THIS. SO THE TENTH WHEREAS CLAUSE, I MEAN IF I END UP SUPPORTING, THIS I WANT TO POINT OUT A FEW THINGS THAT THE TENTH WHEREAS CLAUSE SAYS THE TRANSPORTATION ENDORSED THE GOAL AND VIEWS THIS GOAL AS AN URGENT NEED FOR CITY SPENDING AND PLANNING. AND I -- I DISAGREE WITH THAT. I RECOGNIZE THAT THAT'S HOW THEY FELL AND THAT'S WHY IT'S IN THIS WHEREAS CLAUSE, BUT I COMPLETELY DISAGREE THAT IN LIGHT OF EVERYTHING ELSE THAT WE HAVE GOING ON THAT THIS IS AN URGENT NEED. SO I JUST WANTED TO THROW THAT OUT THERE. SECONDLY. THE PENULTIMATE RESOLVE CLAUSE. IMMEDIATELY CHANGES, ENFORCEMENT STRATEGIES. SO THAT SOUNDS LIKE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PUT IT BACK ON THE HOMEOWNER LIKE IT ALREADY IS AND SO I'M NOT SURE HOW THAT WILL JIVE WITH WHAT WE ARE SPEAKING WITH THIS MUNICIPAL -- THE MUNICIPALITY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THIS AND TAKING THE OWNERSHIP OF THIS, AND SO I'M INTERESTED TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS THERE. AND JUST GENERALLY, I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY, YOU KNOW, THE BUDGET PROCESSES ARE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PRIORITIZE OUR NEEDS AND OUR CITY PLANNING AND SPENDING ALONG WITH C.I.P. AND OTHER MAJOR ASSESSMENTS OF OUR -- OF OUR GOALS AND OUR DIRECTION AND I JUST -- I THINK -- I MAY CONSIDER THAT AND I HAVE HEARD THIS FROM CONSTITUENTS THAT FOLKS OUTSIDE LOOKING IN, THIS REALLY SOUNDS A LOT LIKE WHAT IS SOMETIMES CHARACTERIZED AS THE FIRST WORLD PROBLEM HERE. NOW I KNOW THAT THEY ARE DEFINITELY PART OF OUR TRANSPORTATION NETWORK JUST AS OUR STREETS ARE AND OUR CITY PATHS THROUGH THE PARKS ARE AND I CERTAINLY THINK THAT PARKS SHOULD BE DOING THAT AND I APPRECIATE THE NOTION THAT THIS ADDRESSES CORRIDORS. I THINK THAT'S GREAT, BUT WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT THIS SOME YEARS BACK, MR. HUPY, I THINK THE NUMBER THAT WAS APPLIED TO THIS WAS PRETTY ASTRONOMICAL AND I GUESS MY GENERAL QUESTION FOR ANYONE, INCLUDING OUR CITY ADMINISTRATOR WHAT CAN WE POSSIBLY ANTICIPATE CUTTING TO PAY FOR THIS. THAT'S ALL. THANK YOU.
02:45:30.501: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND?
02:45:32.003: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. WHEN COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS FIRST OFFERED UP COSPONSORSHIP, I THOUGHT OTHER PEOPLE WHO DO WORK THAT'S MORE RELATED TO THIS WERE GOING TO JUMP ON IT AND THEY DIDN'T. SO I JUST WANT TO PUBLICLY THANK HER AND ASK TO BE ADDED AS A COSPONSOR. I THINK THIS IS AN OUTSTANDING PROCESS. I LIKE THAT IT -- IT DOESN'T TELL US WHERE WE THINK WE ARE GOING NECESSARILY. IT REALLY DOES LEAVE ALL SORTS OF POSSIBILITIES OPEN AND IT ALLOWS IT TO BE AN ITERATIVE PROCESS WHERE WE CAN ACTUALLY JUST TRY POTENTIALLY SOME LESS EXPENSIVE PILOTS. NEXT YEAR FOCUS ON THE AREAS THAT WE KNOW ARE THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS FOR MOBILITY AND ACCESS AND THEN GO FROM THERE. SO I THINK IF THIS WAS SAYING NEXT YEAR WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A MUNICIPAL PROGRAM THAT PAYS FOR ALL OF SIDEWALK REMOVAL, YOU KNOW, I WOULDN'T NECESSARILY BE READY TO SUPPORT THAT. BUT I DO THINK THAT -- THAT THIS -- YOU KNOW, IT INVOLVED -- IT INVOLVED ALL THE RIGHT PEOPLE. IT ALIGNS WITH COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD AND ALIGNS WITH A LOT OF OUR GOALS. SO I JUST REALLY APPRECIATE THE PROCESS THAT SHE TOOK AND LOOK FORWARD TO SOME OF THIS INFORMATION THAT'S GOING TO COME BACK. AND I THINK EVEN -- I HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH JUST FROM MEMBERS THE COMMUNITY LOOKING AT DIFFERENT MODELS THAT OTHER CITIES USE THAT ARE NOT $2 MILLION A YEAR MODELS. SO I THINK THERE MAY BE A WAY TO GET US THERE OR TO GET US TO REALLY IMPROVE OUR TRANSPORTATION NETWORK WITHOUT THAT PRICE TAG. SO THANK YOU.
02:47:16.273: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER EYER.
02:47:19.310: >> Councilmember Eyer: THANK YOU. I THINK THIS IS A REALLY STRONG RESOLUTION. I THINK IT REFLECTS THE VALUES THAT WE HOLD AS A COMMUNITY. AS I SAID TO MR. CRAWFORD BACK IN JANUARY, IF I WERE DESIGNING A CITY FROM SCRATCH TODAY, I WOULD NEVER LEAVE SIDEWALK MAINTENANCE TO INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNERS. I THINK, YOU KNOW, ENSURING THAT WE HAVE A COMPLETE WELL-FUNCTIONING SIDEWALK SYSTEM IS -- IT'S AN INTEGRAL PART OF A CITY, IT'S AN EQUITY ISSUE, BOTH IN TERMS OF ECONOMICS AND PHYSICAL ABILITY. IT'S A CLIMATE ACTION ISSUE, AND IT'S A HEALTH ISSUE. SO I THINK THE PROCESS OF CREATING THIS RESOLUTION WHILE NOT PERFECT WAS PRETTY SOLID, STARTING WITH AN INITIAL IDEA OF THEM GATHERING THE INPUT FROM COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS AND FINALLY EVOLVING INTO WHAT WE HAVE BEFORE US TONIGHT. SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THE WORK OF COUNCIL MEMBERS BRIGGS AND GRISWOLD ON THIS, BOTH OF WHOM HAVE LONG BEEN ADVOCATES IN THIS SPACE IN THEIR OWN WAY, AND I WILL BE PROUD TO CAST A VOTE IN FAVOR OF IT TONIGHT.
02:48:26.043: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
02:48:28.212: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. I HAVE A QUESTION. THE SECOND WHEREAS CLAUSE SAYS 27% OF ANN ARBOR RESIDENTS WALK OR USE TRANSIT TO GOOD ET CETERA GET TO WORK.THERE'S NO CITATIONE THAT IS BEING DRAWN FROM. CAN THE SPONSORS OF THIS RESOLUTION POINT ME TO WHERE THAT'S -- THAT FACT IS COMING FROM? AND THEN AS I LOOK AT THIS I DO HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS. I KNOW THAT PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN VERY POSITIVELY TOWARDS THIS RESOLUTION. I THINK IT SETS UP A LOT OF FALSE HOPE AND I DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DELIVER ON MOST OF THIS. I KNOW I BROUGHT A RESOLUTION THAT'S NOW STUCK IN THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION T DEAL WITH SOMETHING THAT IELT WAS MORE MANAGEABLE AND MORE PRACTICAL THAN -- THAN WHAT THIS CALLS FOR. AND I REALLY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE PROCESS. THIS, AGAIN, WAS ADDED AFTER WE SUBMITTED OUR QUESTIONS. IT WAS NOT REVIEWED BY THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION. I LISTENED TO THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION'S MEETING AND THIS -- THIS RESOLUTION ITSELF WAS NOT REVIEWED BY THEM. I WAS TOLD THAT THE RESOLUTION I BROUGHT TWO WEEKS AGO NEEDED TO BE REVIEWED BY THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION AND GET THEIR INPUT BEFORE IT COMES TO THIS BODY. SO WITH -- WITH THE LACK OF ADVANCED NOTICE TO GET QUESTIONED COMMITTED, I -- I MOVED TO HAVE THIS POSTPONED UNTIL THE MARCH 15th MEETING SO I CAN GET SOME BETTER ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS I HAVE REGARDING THIS RESOLUTION.
02:50:24.995: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE A SECOND. SECOED BY COUNCILMEMBER NELSON. DISCUSSION OF THE POSTPONEMENT? COUNCILMEMR BRIGGS ITHE QUEUE.
02:50:39.009: >> Councilmember Briggs: YES, THANK YOU JUST AROUND THE DISCUION OF PRESS IS AUALLY WHY THE FOCUS --
02:50:48.786: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEER RAMLI, CAN YOU PASE MUTE YOUR --
02:50:52.723: >> Councilmeer Ramlawi: SOY. Councilmember Briggs: THAT WAS KIN OF W I FORMED MY COENTS THE WAY I DID BECAUSE I KNEWHAT WAS ONE OF T COERNS OF H T ADDSS THIS PROCESS WKED. I -- THE TRANSPORTATN A ROLUTION THAHERE SOME OF THESE COMNENTS IN AND THEN THEY PRODED CAR FEEACK ON ATIN OF -- WHATHEYAND TOEE MOVING FORRD WHICH WAS WHAT I INCLUDED IN THE -- IN THAT WHEREAS CLAUSE AROUND THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION. I MADE AMENDMENTED, THE SECOND -- THE THIRD RESOLVE CLAUSE IS BASICALLY WHAT THEY HAD SEEN AND SOME OF THE OTHER PIECES ARE BASED ENTIRELY ON THEIR FEEDBACK TO ME ON THAT AS MANY OF THE WHEREAS CLAUSES WHICH WERE FOCUSED ON THEIR WORK AROUND THE PEDESTRIAN AND SAFETY ACCESS TASK FORCE AND THEY EXPLICITLY SAID THAT THEY WERE COMFORTABLE WITH ME WORKING ON DEVELOPING THIS RESOLUTION AND BRINGING IT TO COUNCIL. SO I WORKED WITH THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION CHAIR AND INCORPORATED THE FEEDBACK OF THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION AND BROUGHT THIS HERE TONIGHT AT THE BEHEST OF THE ORIGINAL SPONSORS WHICH WERE HOPING TO GET IT BACK DURING THE WINTER SEASON WHERE THIS IS A LITTLE BIT MORE RELEVANT. I DO APOLOGIZE THAT IT CAME ON FRIDAY. I DO BELIEVE THAT OUR COUNCIL RULES ALLOW FOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO ASK QUESTIONS OF STAFF WHEN THESE -- THESE ITEMS COME A LITTLE BIT LATER. SO TO YOUR QUESTION AROUND THE SECOND WHEREAS CLAUSE THAT INFORMATION COMES DIRECTLY FROM THE WORK AROUND OUR TRANSPORTATION PLAN UPDATE. I WAS MAKING SURE I WAS TAKING A LOOK AT THAT AND GETTING THE DATA FROM THAT AS SOME OF THE OTHER ELEMENTS TRYING TO ALIGN WHERE OUR -- YOU KNOW, WHAT OUR -- THE VALUES THAT ARE IMBUED WITHIN OUR TRANSPORTATION PLAN, ALTHOUGH THEY -- IT HAS NOT BEEN ADOPTED YET, IT'S BEEN VERY CLEAR FROM THE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT WORK THAT BEEN DONE OVER LAST TWO YEARS ABOUT WHAT OUR RESIDENTS ARE LOOKING FOR IN THE TRANSPORTATION.
02:53:10.093: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
02:53:11.028: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WOULD SUPPORT A POSTPONEMENT IF IT WOULD ADDRESS COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI'S CONCERN AND IT WHETHER WE NEED TO HAVE A FREE STANDING RESOLUTION FOR SNOW REMOVAL IN THE D.D.A. AREA OR IF WE COULD ROLL THAT INTO THIS RESOLUTION, THAT D.D.A. HAS BEEN MENTIONED IN A COUPLE OF PLACES. AND IF WE NEED TO BE MORE SPECIFIC, I WOULD BE WILLING TO DO THAT AS WELL AND THAT WAY IT WOULD BE EVEN MORE COMPREHENSIVE. OH, I DO HAVE ONE -- MAY I ASK A QUESTION OF MOLLY? SNOW REMOVAL ON SIDEWALKS IS REQUIRED AFTER ONE INCH OF SNOW. ON CITY STREETS, IS IT THREE OR FOUR INCHES?
02:54:05.782: >> Mayor Taylor: YOU ARE ON MUTE.
02:54:06.917: >> SO YOU ARE ASKING IF THERE'S A REQUIREMENT IN CODE FOR SNOW REMOVAL ON STREETS?
02:54:12.356: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES.
02:54:13.290: >> THERE IS NOT. WE HAVE A LONG STANDING PRACTICE OF PLOWING WHENEVER WE THINK IT'S NEEDED. BUT IF WE HAVE A STORM OF 4 INCHES OR MORE WE WOULD MOVE INTO THE STREETS FASTER THAN WE WOULD BE.
02:54:34.978: >> Councilmember Griswold: OKAY. SO YOU DON'T PLOW WHEN THERE IS 1 INCH OF SNOW.
02:54:41.418: >> NO, THAT IS NOT SAFE TO SAY.
02:54:44.688: >> IN A SMALL EVENT, AGAIN, ANYTHING UNDER 4 INCHES IT JUST DEPENDS ON THE TYPE OF SNOW, WHAT WE THINK IS WARRANTED. WE'LL ADDRESS MAJOR ROADS FIRST AND WHEN WE ARE FINISHED WITH THOSE MAJOR ROADS, WE WILL MOVE INTO LOCAL ROADS.
02:54:59.603: >> ALSO THERE IS A DIFFERENCE IN SIDEWALK ORDINANCE REQUIRES CLEANING TO BARE PAVEMENT. WE DO NOT TREAT STREETS TO BARE MOVEMENT, WE TREAT THEM FOR TRACTION. SO WE HAVE DIFFERENT END GOALS.
02:55:16.553: >> NOT EVERY ONE INCH EVENT, WE PLOW LOCAL STREETS IT DID HE STN THE EVENT AND THE TYPE OF SNOW.
02:55:28.131: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
02:55:33.837: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WILL CHIME IN AND SAY I WILL SUPPORT THIS POSTPONEMENT. THE ADMINISTRATOR COUNCIL QUESTIONS KNOWING THIS WOULD BE BACK ON THE AGENDA ON THE 15th F OUR CONCERNS AND CONSIDERATIONS AND MAY EVEN HELP OUTLINE POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS THAT -- THAT'S A PRIME REASON FOR ME TO SUPPORT THIS POSTPONEMENT SINCE NOTHING WILL BE ACTED UPON IN THIS SNOW SEASON, YOU MIGHT SAY. A SECONDARY REASON IS MY DISCONNECT OVER HOW IT IS THAT WE REFER THINGS TO TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION, THEY DON'T DISCUSS 'EM AND THEN SOMETHING WHOLLY DIFFERENT COMES BACK TO US. SO I SHARE MY COLLEAGUES CONCERNS ABOUT PROCESS ON THIS MATTER AND AS A SECONDARY REASON, THAT'S WHY I WILL SUPPORT A ONE SESSION POSTPONEMENT. THANK YOU.
02:56:25.322: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
02:56:26.189: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. YOU KNOW, I JUST -- I GOT TO SAY THAT I SUPPORT A LOT OF WHAT'S IN THIS RESOLUTION. BUT I AM UNPREPARED TO VOTE TONIGHT. BASED ON THE FACTS THAT I JUST HEARD REPEATED AND I HAVE EXPLAINED A COUPLE OF TIMES. I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO BE A PART OF THIS PROCESS. I GOT THIS RESOLUTION ON FRIDAY. I WOULD LIKE TO BE A PART OF IT. AND I WOULD LIKE TO SUPPORT IT. ONCE I'M COMFORTABLE IN VOTING FOR IT, I FEEL THAT I'M NOT PREPARED, AND AND THAT WE SHOULD BE GIVEN TIME TO SUBMIT QUESTIONS AND TIME TO THINK ABOUT THIS. I FEAR THAT IT'S -- IT'S SO BROAD AND COMPLEX THAT MY -- MY SPECIFIC INTERESTS THAT'S THE D.D.A. AREAS WHICH I THINK MAKE THE MOST SENSE FOR MANY DIFFERENT REASONS WILL BE -- WILL BE LOST IN ALL OF THIS AND I WOULD RATHER SEE THE D.D.A. BE TEASED OUT FROM THE MAIN PART OF THIS SO THAT WE CAN FOCUS ON IT, ON A DUAL TRACK. WE CAN LOOK AT THINGS OUTSIDE OF THE D.D.  D.D.A. AND THINGS INSE D.D. AX. I WANT TO MAKE -- D.D.A. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S IN THERE SO THAT FOCUS IS NOT LOST.
02:57:56.413: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER EYER.
02:57:57.514: >> Councilmember Eyer: THANK YOU, I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING POSTPONEMENT. WE TALKED AT THIS ISSUE AT TWO COUNCIL MEETINGS NOW. WE ALL HAD THE ABILITY TO WATCH THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION DISCUSSION, WHICH, YOU KNOW, WAS A GOOD DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS AND INFORMED COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS' FINAL RESOLUTION THAT SHE BROUGHT BACK. WE ALL KNEW SHE WAS WORKING ON IT AND WE ALL KNEW SHE WAS GOING TO BRING SOMETHING BACK TONIGHT. AND SO THERE'S BEEN AMPLE OPPORTUNITY TO ASK HER QUESTIONS, TO GIVE HER FEEDBACK, AND IN ADDITION TO THAT, WE KNEW -- WE NOW HAVE A NEW COUNCIL RULE THAT ALLOWS FOR QUESTIONS ON LATE BREAKING ITEMS. SO THAT, YOU KNOW, COUNCILMEMBERS COULD HAVE SUBMITTED QUESTIONS THIS MORNING, YOU KNOW, UP UNTIL -- I FORGET WHAT TIME IT IS, 9:30 THIS MORNING. AND HAD THEM ANSWERED BY STAFF. SO I THINK THERE'S BEEN AMPLE OPPORTUNITY FOR EVERYONE TO DO THEIR HOMEWORK AND I'M READY TO VOTE.
02:59:01.611: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS.
02:59:02.646: >> Councilmember Briggs: I WANTED TO STRESS MAYBE A THIRD TIME THAT TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION DID -- RECEIVED A RESOLUTION THAT HAD MANY OF THE SAME AMOUNTS, PROVIDED FEEDBACK. I TOOK THAT FEEDBACK AND THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT I RECEIVED FROM TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION ALTERED THE A RESOLUTION. IT'S NOT FAIR TO SHUT THAT THE S NOT FAIR TO SUGGEST THAT THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION DID NOT HAVE FEEDBACK. TO COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI'S CONCERN, I REALLY -- I EXPLICITLY BROUGHT UP IN TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION A REQUEST THAT -- YOUR RESOLUTION, UNFORTUNATELY IT COULDN'T FORMALLY CONSIDERED BECAUSE OF THE TIME FRAME. I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT THAT WE COULDN'T HAVE A DISCUSSION AND IT WAS A PRETTY PACKED AGENDA, OTHERWISE, I THINK THEY MAYBE MIGHT HAVE TRIED TO PROVIDE MORE FEEDBACK AT THIS TIME. THERE WAS, YOU KNOW, LIMITED DISCUSSION AROUND IT, BUT I REALLY FROM THE FEEDBACK THAT I'M SENSING WE ARE GETTING FROM TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION, IT'S SORT OF THIS OVERARCHING FEEDBACK THAT WE HAVE RECEIVED AROUND WHERE THEY WANT TO SEE US HEADED POLICY-WISE. I TRIED TO EXPLICITLY INCORPORATE YOUR INTEREST IN THE D.D.A., AND ONE THAT I COMPLETELY SHARE. I THINK YOU ARE 100% RIGHT THAT WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE WITH ADDITIONAL FOCUS SOME SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR D.D.A. AND THAT'S WHY OUR THIRD RESOLVE CLAUSE EXPLICITLY ASKS FOR -- IN THE REPORT THAT WILL BE DELIVERED TO COUNCIL BY SEPTEMBER 6th STRATEGIES FOR ADDRESSING THE PROBLEM BY ZONED AREA OF THE CITY, INCLUDING THE D.D.A., RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS, COMMERCIAL AND TRANSIT CORRIDORS. I'M EXPLICITLY ASKING -- WE ARE EXPLICITLY ASKING IF WE PASSED THIS FOR A REPORT THAT SUGGESTS, YOU KNOW, HOW -- WHAT COULD HAPPEN WITHIN THE D.D.A. THOSE STRATEGIES ARE LIKELY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WOULD HAPPEN ALONG THE TRANSIT CORRIDORS. I THINK WE NEED THAT INFORMATION AND WHAT YOU ARE ASKING FOR. I THINK THIS RESOLUTION ADDRESSES A LOT OF WHAT YOU ARE ASKING FOR. SO.
03:01:11.875: >> Mayor Taylor: ON THE POSTPONEMENT. COUNCILMEMBER DISCH AND THEN WE VOTE. COUNCILMEMBER DISCH, YOU ARE ON MUTE.
03:01:23.053: >> Councilmember Disch: I LOWERED MYSELF BUT I DIDN'T UNMUTE MYSELF. I'M NOT SUPPORTING POSTPONEMENT EITHER. WHEN I READ THIS RESOLUTION, NOT ONLY DID I SEE TT STAKEHOLDERS WERE ENGAGED BUT ILSO SEE THAT THE DISCUSSIONS THAT WE HAD ON COUNCIL AND MR.  -- COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI'S RESOLUTION FROM TWO WEEKS AGO, HAVE BEEN INCORPORATED INTO THIS RESOLUTION. SO, YES, THE THIRD RESOLVE CLAUSE ASKS FOR STRATEGIES. SAYS THAT STRATEGIES SHOULD INCLUDE ADDRESSING ISSUES BY THE ZONED AREA AND THE FOURTH RESOLVE CLAUSED SAYS THAT CITY COUNCIL DIRECTS THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR TO PILOT SOLUTIONS IN THE D.D.A. PREFERABLY AND PREFERABLY ALONG ONE OR MORE MAJOR TRANSIT CORRIDORS. SO I DON'T -- WHAT I SEE IS AN ATTEMPT TO VERY DIRECTLY INCORPORATE THE DISCUSSIONS WE HAVE BEEN HAVING. I CAN'T THINK OF SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TALKED MORE ABOUT THAN SNOW. WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT SNOW AND HEARING ABOUT SNOW FROM RESIDES FOR THE LAST SIX WEEKS, IT'S BEEN CONSTANT. SO I THINK THAT IT IS WONDERFUL THAT WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE FORWARD WITH ACTIONS THAT WILL SEE FRUIT DURING THE WINTER OF THE 2021 TO 2021. FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE POSTPONEMENT. ROLLALL VOTE.
03:02:59.749: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES.
03:03:03.887: >> Councilmember Disch: YES.
03:03:04.487: >> Councmember Griswold: S.
03:03:08.258: >>ouncilmember Song: YES. --
03:03:09.392: >> Mayoraylor: THIS IS ON POSTPEMENT. Gra: THIS IS DO WE NEE TO RESET
03:03:13.630: >> W ARE VING. Councilmemb Disch: NO --
03:03:17.067: >> Couilmember Gra: I THINK THERE WAS SOME CONFUSI. Councilmemberisch: I WAS COUSED.
03:03:23.840: >>ouncilmemberayner:  IT WAS ANNOUNCED ON THE POSTPONENT.
03:03:29.345: >> Mor Tayr: YOU ARE VING ON THE POSTPONEMT. REQUEST TT RESET.dI WILL Cncilmb Dch: PLEASE. THANK YOU. I'M SOR.
03:03:36.386: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WILL CALL A POINT OF ORDER.
03:03:40.356: >> Mayor Taylor: I DON'T KNOW THIS RULE. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT WHEN PEOPLE UNDER THE MIDST OF A VOTE IF THERE ARE -- IF PEOPLE VOTE IN ERROR AND THEY CAUGHT THEMSELVES, THAT WE HONOR THAT ERROR. MR. POSTEMA IS THAT IMPROPER?
03:04:02.712: >> City Atty. Postema: I WAS ABOUT TO TURN ON THE LIGHT.
03:04:06.483: >> Mayor Taylor: THAT'S QUITE ALL RIGHT. SO WHEN PEOPLE HAVE VOTED IN ERROR, THAT IS TO SAY IN THE MIDST OF A VOTE, SOME COUNCILMEMBERS VOTED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE, BELIEVING THEY WERE VOTING ON THE MAIN MOTION, WHEREAS THEY HAD SPOKEN THAT THEY WERE -- THEY WISHED TO VOTE AGAINST THE POSTPONEMENT. THE QUESTION IS -- IS IT IMPROPER TO RERUN THE VOTE AFTER IN THE MIDST OF A VOTE.
03:04:38.314: >> City Atty. Postema: IF YOU REALLY WANT ME TO TAKE TIME, I WOULD SUGGEST WE TAKE A BREAK AND LOOK AT IT. MY USUAL ADVICE IF YOU ARE LOOKING AT -- TO ROBERT'S RULES AT THIS POINT, IS THAT IF IT IS NOT WHAT THEY INTENDED TO VOTE, YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD REALLY LOOK AT, IT BUT I CAN'T ANSWER THAT OFF THE CUFF:  SO IF YOU WANT TO TAKE A LITTLE BREAK ON THAT, I -- I CAN -- BUT CONCERNLY IF THE BODY -- CERTAINLY IF THE BODY WANTS THE VOTE TO BE TO START OVER, YOU CAN DO IT. I WOULD NEED TO LOOK AT THIS FURTHER AND I WOULD TOUCH BASE WITH MR. FROST ALSO BUT I CAN'T DO IT OFF THE CUFF JUST SITTING HERE.
03:05:26.996: >> Mayor Taylor: DO WE HAVE ANY OBJECTION TO REVOTING?
03:05:34.771: >> Councilmember Hayner:  ANY OBJECTION IS TO THE CORRUPTION OF THE CLERK'S. IT WAS NOT A PERSON RAISING THEIR HAND MEANING TO SAY I DIDN'T VOTE THAT WAY.
03:05:46.316: >> Councilmember Disch: I DIDN'T RAISE MY HAND. I WAS SHAKING MY HEAD. I'M SORRY. I'M EXHAUSTED. MY MOTHER IS ILL. I'M SORRY.
03:05:56.326: >> Councilmember Hayner:  VOTE AGAIN IF IT'S GOING TO GO THE WAY YOU WISH. ROLL CALL VOTE ON THE POSTPONEMENT.
03:06:08.371: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES.
03:06:11.040: >> Councilmember Disch: NO.
03:06:11.641: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES.
03:06:18.514: >> Councilmember Song: NO.
03:06:21.351: >> Councilmember Grand: NO.
03:06:23.620: >> Councilmember Radina: NO.
03:06:27.357: >> Mayor Taylor: NO.
03:06:29.092: >> Councilmember Eyer: NO.
03:06:29.659: >> Councilmember Nelson:  NO.
03:06:32.495: >> Councilmember Briggs: NO.
03:06:34.497: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES.
03:06:37.400: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION FAILS.
03:06:39.702: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN MOTION AS AMENDED. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, I LOST TRACK OF HOW MANY TIMES YOU HAVE SPOKEN ON THE MAIN MOTION.
03:06:56.786: >> Councilmember Hayner:  NO, AS FEDERAL AVIATION FACILITATORI CAN'T RECALL.
03:07:07.263: >> Mayor Taylor: I'M GOING TO PUT THIS AS THE SECOND TIME ON THE MAIN MOTION. DO YOU HAVE AN OBJECTION TO THAT?
03:07:11.968: >> Councilmember Hayner:  NO. I'M NOT GOING TO SUPPORT THIS EVEN THOUGH I SUPPORT THE NOTION BEHIND IT. I'M SURE IT WILL PASS BECAUSE CLEARLY THE VOTE IS BEING NUDGED A CERTAIN WAY PROCEDURALLY AND THAT'S FINE, BUT THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS WITH THE CLAIMS THAT ARE MADE IN THESE WHEREAS STATEMENTS AND THEY ARE NOT REALLY BACKED UP. AND SO I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE FOUND WHEN IT -- BECAUSE OF THE AMENDMENT THAT COUNCILWOMAN GRISWOLD SET FORWARD EARLIER THAT SOME OF THESE -- SOME OF THE CLAIMS THAT ARE MADE HERE JUST DON'T JIVE WITH EVEN OUR OWN MOTORIZED TRANSPORTATION PLAN. AND SO I'M JUST NOT GOING TO SUPPORT THIS OUT OF GENERAL PRINCIPLE. I JUST DON'T LIKE THE WAY THIS IS GOING. I GET A SENSE THAT -- LIKE I SAID BEFORE, WE HAVE SO MANY ISSUES HERE IN THE CITY, SO MANY ISSUES. WE HAVE B PEOPLE CALLING UP AND BEGGING FOR BETTER SPENDING ON MENTAL HEALTH BUT WE WILL SHOVEL SIDEWALKS IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS INSTEAD. OKAY. I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS. I WOULD HAVE PRIOR TO THAT LITTLE NOTION AROUND THE VOTE, BUT IT'S -- THAT WAS AN OFFENSIVE DISPLAY OF DISORDER.
03:08:21.471: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER SONG.
03:08:24.273: >> Councilmember Song: SO I WILL APOLOGIZE FOR THE CONFUSION AS WELL. I THOUGHT WE WERE VOLTING ON THE MAIN MOTION -- VOTING ON THE MAIN MOTION. IT LOOKS LIKE COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS HAS DONE THE WORK, WORKING WITH TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION, YOU KNOW, HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE D.D.A. AND PULLING ALL OF THESE CONSIDERATIONS TO GO IN HER RESOLUTION. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT IS STOPPING COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI TO WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION AS WELL OR WORKING MORE CLOSELY WITH COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS.
03:09:04.147: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: POINT OF ORDER.
03:09:07.784: >> Councilmember Song: OH, OKAY. I GUESS THAT'S ALL.
03:09:11.654: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
03:09:17.960: >> Councilmember Grand: THANKS. JUST WIN POINT I FORGOT TO BRING UP EARLIER. COUNCILMEMBER RADINA AND I HAVE HAD SOME IMPORTANT CONVERSATIONS BECAUSE THERE'S AN ORDINANCE PIECE IN HERE AS WELL ABOUT -- ABOUT THE WAY THAT THE CURRENT POLICY WE HAVE IS ENFORCED. AND WE HAVE H HEARD FROM WONDERL NEIGHBORS WHO HAVE BEEN TICKETED EVEN WHEN THEY WERE OUT TRYING TO HELP THE SINGLE MOM WITH FOUR KIDS SHOVEL THEIR -- SHOVEL THEIR SNOW AND ONE NEIGHBOR DOESN'T LIKE THE JOB THAT DID IT. SO IT -- WE LEARN AS WE GO SOMETIMES AND WE TRY THINGS AND I THINK IT ALSO GIVES US THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE HEARD THIS WINTER AND CONTINUE TO HEAR ABOUT HOW WE ENFORCE THIS. I THINK THIS CAN PUT AN UNDUE BURDEN ON SOME RESIDENTS. AND I JUST WANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT, YOU KNOW, WE ARE ALL -- WE ARE ALL -- YOU KNOW, EVERYONE IN THIS COMMUNITY IS -- HAS BEEN DEALING WITH A LOT. WE ARE COMING UM ON A YEAR OF THIS, RIGHT, AND LET'S TRY TO GIVE EACH ONE A LITTLE BIT OF SUPPORT.
03:10:50.286: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
03:10:52.855: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. I WILL PUSH BACK ON THIS EFFORT TO SAY THERE IS INCLUSIVITY AND THE PROCESS IS AS WHAT IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN. MINE RESOLUTION WAS STUCK IN TRANSPORTATION FOR A MONTH. THIS RESOLUTION COMES UP WITHOUT ANY REVIEW BY THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION. THEY DID NOT FORMALLY REVIEW THIS RESOLUTION. AND SO, YOU KNOW, IT'S GREAT THAT WE HAVE UNTIL 9:30 ON MONDAY TO SUBMIT QUESTIONS BUT I WORK 30 HOURS ON THE WEEKENDS RUNNING A RESTAURANT BECAUSE I STILL HAVE TO WORK. AND I DON'T HAVE TIME TO DO THIS OTHER ENOUGH ON NEW COUNCIL BUSINESS THAT'S NOT URGENT. THIS IS NOT AN URGENT MATTER. AND THERE'S NO CONSIDERATION GIVEN TO MEMBERS OF COUNCIL WHO WORK ON THE WEEKENDS. THEY SAY THESE ARE THE NEW RULES, DEAL WITH IT. WE ARE SUPPOSED TO COME PREPARED AND BE CORDIAL. THIS IS NOT ANY OF THAT RIGHT NOW. ANYONE WHO IS WITNESSING THIS KNOWS THAT. AND SO BACK TO MY QUESTION. I WON'T SUPPORT THIS. GO AHEAD, IT WILL PASS. I'M SURE IT WILL. BUT I HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THE WAY THIS IS BEING DONE HOW THE SAUSAGE IS BEING MADE. THIS IS ALL FOR PUBLIC DISPLAY. THE SECOND WHEREAS CLAUSE SAYS 27% OF N ANN ARBOR RESIDENTS WAK OR USE TRANSIT TO GET TO WORK. I'M ASKING WHERE THIS INFORMATION COMES FROM. I'M LOOKING AT THE 2009 TRANSPORTATION PLAN UPDATE, PAGE 78, 4-20 AND IT STATES NON-MOTORIZED FACILITIES IN ANN ARBOR ARE VITAL TO THE TRANSPORTATION NETWORK AS WITNESSED BY 18% OF COMMUTERS. WHERE DOES 27% COME FROM? THAT'S A 50% INFLATION ON THIS 2009 TRANSPORTATION UPDATE. THERE'S SO MANY THINGS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN ASKED QUESTIONS. THE QUESTIONS I HAVE ARE FOR STAFF, NOT FOR THE SPONSORING COUNCILMEMBER. THAT'S THE OPPORTUNITY AND THE PRIVILEGE THAT I THINK THE COUNCILMEMBERS DESERVE AND THAT THE COUNCIL MINORITY HAS BEEN SHUT OUT OF. WE ARE NOT -- PEOPLE ARE NOT PLAYING FAIR AND THIS SIMPLE SNOW RESOLUTION ARE QUITE OBVIOUS OF THE GAMES AND TACTICS BEING DEPLOYED.
03:13:46.429: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
03:13:47.363: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I JUST WANT TO REMIND MY COLLEAGUES AND THE VIEWING AUDIENCE THAT THIS RESOLUTION DOES NOT HAVE ANY DOLLARS ASSOCIATED WITH IT, NOR DOES IT CALL FOR COMPREHENSIVE MUNICIPAL SNOW SHOVELING. WHAT WE ARE DOING RIGHT NOW, WE ARE COLLECTING DATA, DOING A FEASIBILITY STUDY SO WE CAN MAKE DATA-DRIVEN DECISIONS WHICH ARE COMPATIBLE WITH VISION ZERO. THANK YOU.
03:14:21.197: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILEMBER DISCH.
03:14:24.100: >> Councilmember Disch: SO ON -- I IMAGINE THAT FIGURES FOR NON-CAR USE VARY DEPENDING ON YOUR METHODOLOGY, BUT ON PAGE 24 OF THE SNOW BUDDY REPORT THAT WE RECEIVED, THEY TAKE -- THEY TAKE DATA FROM THE U.S. 2000 CENSUS COMMUTE TO WORK DATA. AND IT CREDITS ANN ARBOR IN 2000 -- SO BASED ON OUR YEAR 2000 WIT 2.4% OF PEOPLE GETTING AROUND BY BIKE AND 16.5 PEDESTRIAN AND 6.9% PUBLIC TRANSIT. SO FOR THE YEAR 2000, IT WAS 25.8% NON-CAR. THAT'S PRETTY CONSISTENT WITH A NUMBER OF 27% OF ANN ARBOR RESIDES WALK OR USE TRANSIT TO GET TO WORK BASED ON MORE RECT DATA ANDLSO COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS ALREADY SD WHERE SHE GO THAT FIGURE, BUT THIS FIGURE THE SNOWUDDY REPORT CORROBORES HER FIGE.
03:15:31.300: >>ayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMR BRIGGS. I DN'T.lmember Bris: SORRY, IF COUNCILMEER RAMLAWI CONTACTED ME BEFORE, I COULD - I'M PRETTY SE I GOT THIS THROUG THE MONTH MOBILIT FACT BOOKND IT WAS IN AITION O OU TRANSIT AND PESTRIAN NUMBERS, BUT WILL -- I C G PRIMY CONCERN IS AHEREAS CLAUSE AROUND TS, I WILL CONSIDER IT A FRIENDLY AMENDMENT TO REMOVE THAT FACT IF THAT SOMEHOW SEEMS ENTIRELY OFFENSIVE. HOWEVER, I'M HAPPY TO PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION TO YOU.
03:16:12.608: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN MOTION? FOR MY PART, I'M DELIGHTED THIS IS MOVING FORWARD. I THINK THIS IS THE CULMINATION OF A GREAT DEAL OF WORK THAT HAS BEEN PERFORMED BY THIS COUNCIL, BY MEMBERS OF THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION, AND OTHER INTERESTED RESIDENTS. YOU KNOW, WE -- WE HAVE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS NOW TAKEN STEPS TO RECOGNIZE THAT OUR TRANSPORTATION NETWORK IS COMPRISED OF -- IS MULTIMODAL, THAT IT INVOLVES VEHICLES, OF COURSE, BUT THAT IT ALSO INVOLVES, YOU KNOW, INFRASTRUCTURE FOR PEDESTRIANS AND INFRASTRUCTURE FOR CYCLISTS AND THIS IS AN IMPORTANT STEP TOWARDS -- TOWARDS PUTTING THAT VALUE SET INTO PRACTICE. IT WON'T BE AN EASY SOLUTION, CERTAINLY. THERE WILL BE SOME COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH IT AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO PROVIDE THAT COST FOR IT IN AN EQUITABLE AND PRUDENT MANNER. BUT NEVERTHELESS, THIS IS -- THIS IS IMPORTANT STEP AND I'M GLAD WE ARE TAKING IT. I WANT TO THANK THE INITIAL MOVERS BEHIND IT AND -- AND BOTH, YOU KNOW, IN THIS BODY AND ELSEWHERE. FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
03:17:38.260: >> Councilmember Hayner:  NO.
03:17:44.700: >> Councilmember Disch: YES.

03:18:07.990: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION CARRIES.
03:18:13.462: >> Mayor Taylor: DO WE HAVE A CLOSED SESSION TODAY, MR. POSTEMA?
03:18:18.400: >> City Atty. Postema: NO, MAYOR.
03:18:21.236: >> Mayor Taylor: WE HAVE BEFORE US THE CLERK'S REPORT OF COMMUNICATIONS, PETITIONS AND REFERRALS. MAY I HAVE A MOTION TO APPROVE THE CLERK'S REPORT, MOVED BY ARE A ZINA AND SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRAND. DISCUSSION OF THE CLERK'S REPORT. ALL IN FAVOR? OPPOSED? THE CLERK'S REPORT IS APPROVED. WE HAVE COMMUNICATIONS TODAY FROM OUR CITY ATTORNEY?
03:18:44.426: >> City Atty. Postema: NO, MAYOR.
03:18:46.495: >> Mayor Taylor: WE NOW COME TO PUBLIC COMMENT GENERAL TIME. PUBLIC COMMENT GENERAL TIME IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MEMBERS OF PUBLIC TO SPEAK TO COUNCIL AND THE COMMUNITY ABOUT MATTERS THE MUNICIPAL INTEREST. YOU NEED NOT SIGN UP IN ADVANCE.

03:19:59.935: >> CAN YOHEAR ME.
03:20:04.807: >> CORY. HOLLAND. I WILL SPEAK BECAUSE THIS IS MY LAST TIME -- I'M NOT AN ACTIVIST OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. AND I WANT TO SPEAK ON SOMETHING I DIDN'T GET TO SPEAK ON EARLIER. A LOT OF THESE ATTACKS AROUND THE COUNTRY ON ASIAN AMERICANS, SOME OF THESE ATTACKS HAVE BEEN INVOLVING FRIENDS. AFRICAN AMER. WANTED TO SPEAK, ANYONE WHO IS LISTENING TO THIS, IN THE AFRICAN AMERICAN, WE GET DISCRIMINATION IF ANYBODY IS ATTACKING ANYBODY ELSE FOR A PERSON OF COLOR FOR DISCRIMINATORY REASON, I THINK THEY SHOULD HAVE SOME SOUL CHECKING. I WANT TO SAY THAT ON BEHALF OF ANYONE WHO HAVE HAS NOT. THE REASON I CAME ON HERE IS BECAUSE LIKE I SAY, I'M AN EARLY PLANNED STAGES OF PROTEST LOOKING OUT FOR OTHER PARTNERS. I WANT INDIVIDUALS TO KNOW WHEN WE COME THERE, THAT THIS IS NOT ABOUT ANTI-LGBTQ SENTIMENT, EVEN THOUGH THE PEOPLE WHO ATTACKED ME BE PART OF THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY. I WANTED TO INVITE ANY LGBTQ INDIVIDUALS OR ORGANIZATIONS OR ANYBODY ELSE WHO STAND FOR JUSTICE TO JOIN IN WHEN THE PROTEST HAPPENS ARE ANYBODY ELSE THAT DEALS WITH DISCRIMINATION. ALSO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT IF YOU DON'T SPEAK FOR JUSTICE -- IF YOU DON'T SPEAK UP FOR INJUSTICE WHEN IT'S SOMEBODY ELSE, THEN THEY ARE NOT GOING TO CARE WHEN IT'S YOU. SO IT MIGHT BE EASY WHEN YOU ARE SITTING BACK AND EVERYTHING IS FINE, AND YOU ARE NOT DEALING WITH THESE INJUSTICES. EVENTUALLY IT WILL BE YOU. SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ANYBODY OUT THERE WHO DOESN'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE DAY-TO-DAY THINGS THAT MOST OF THESE PEOPLE ARE BRINGING UP IN THE PUBLIC DISCUSSIONS THAT BE THANKFUL THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH THOSE TYPE OF ISSUES BUT YOU SHOULD NEVER BE QUIET WHEN 9 PEOPLE ARE FACING INJUSTICE. AND THE LAST THING I WANT TO SAY IS TO ANYBODY OUT THERE, WHO IS -- IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DOO HE WILL WITH LIFE AFTER YOU BECOME DISABLED -- HOW TO DEAL WITH LIFE AFTER YOU BECOME DISABLED, I WOULD LIKE THEM TO COME OUT WITH THE PROTEST AS WELL. A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE DON'T PAY A LOT OF ATTENTION TO DISABLED. ONCE YOU HAVE BEEN DISABLED, YOU FACE A LOT OF DIFFICULTIES YOU DIDN'T REALIZE WERE THERE BEFORE. I WANT TO MAKE SURE ANYBODY WHO IS DEALING WITH DIFFICULTIES LIKE DISABILITIES ALSO COME OUT AND -- AND TAKE INTEREST IN THE PROTEST. THAT'S MY TIME. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO LISTEN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
03:22:44.199: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. CLERK CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING IN 205.
03:22:51.039: >> THIS IS JOE SPAL SPALDING, IM CALLING FROM -- I WANT TO SAY THE BIGGEST INDICATOR OF VETERAN IS HOMELESS WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAVE BEEN CONVICTED OF A FELONY. COUNCILMEMBER RADINA, THANK YOU FOR MENTIONING THE CONNECTION DIRECTLY TO HOMELESSNESS THERE. IN MY WORK WITH VOTERS RIGHTS, I REMEMBER LEARNING ABOUT HORRIBLE STORIES, MICHIGAN PRISON GUARDS TELLING INHALES THAT THEY CAN'T VOTE WHEN THEY ARE BEING RELEASED AND THAT'S JUST ABSOLUTELY NOT TRUE. AND I'M SURE THERE'S A WHOLE BUNCH THAT NEEDS TO GET CLEANED UP IN HOUSING WHEN IT COMES TO BANNING THE BOX BUT IT'S GOOD TO SEE ANN ARBOR LEADING THE WAY. THE SIDE NOTE THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE STORIES ABOUT THAT POSTED ONLINE, ON FACEBOOK, ON TWITTER, BY MLIVE, BY THE REST OF THE MEDIA, TELEVISION NEWS OUTLETS AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE COMMENTS SECTION REFLECTS HOW IMPORTANT THAT DECISION IS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING THAT. I DO WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE RESOLUTION TO WAIVE CLIENT PRIVILEGE HERE FIRST. IT WAS FLIRTING CAN SCARING EVERY ATTORNEY THE CITY COULD HAVE INTO GIVING LESS THAN ARTICULATE LEGAL ADVICE WHICH COULD ALWAYS COST THE CITY TAXPAYER CASH. THE RULES DISCOURAGE COUNCILMEMBERS FROM EMBARRASSING THE COUNCIL ON FACEBOOK. I WANT TO KNOW WHAT RAMLAWI THINKS IS BEING CHILLED. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, YOU FREQUENTLY MOAN AND GR GR GROANU CAN'T SAY THAT DR. LISA DISCH WHO IS ONE OF THE SMARTEST PEOPLE IN ANN ARBOR HAS NO AGENCY AND GETS HER POLICY POSITIONS FROM SAVA WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT YOU SAID ON FACEBOOK. WITHOUT KICKING SAND IN THE FACES OF THE VERY SIM PEOPLE YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT. VIEW POINT DISCRIMINATION, IF YOU ARE SAYING THINGS THAT TEST THE LINE BETWEEN FREE SPEECH AND ACTUAL DID DEFAMATION SO BADLY THEN THE BEST THING THAT CAN BE SAID ABOUT YOUR WORDS IS THAT SAYING THEM ISN'T TECHNICALLY ILLEGAL, YOU ARE PROBABLY EMBARRASSING YOURSELF AND THOSE YOU REPRESENT. FINALLY, I WANT TO SAY THAT IT'S PROBABLY NOT THE BEST USE OF THE ACLU'S TIME TO BE REVIEWING THE COMPLAINTS ABOUT FOLKS WORRYING ABOUT WHATEVER THEY ARE -- THE VIEW POINTS ARE GETTING SUPPRESSED HERE WHICH ARE BEING ARTICULATED ON FACEBOOK. THEY PROBABLY HAVE A LOT MORE IMPORTANT THINGS TO DO GIVEN THE EVENTS OF THE PAST YEAR, ESPECIALLY IN HELPING TO CLEAN UP THE MESS THAT TRUMP LEFT INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS HAD. SO THINK ABOUT THAT WHEN YOU ARE ASKING THEM TO USE THEIR PRECIOUS TIME. THAT'S ALL I HAVE GOT TO SAY. THANKS FOR LISTENING TO ME ONCE AGAIN.
03:25:25.060: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. CLERK CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING IN 556, DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT?
03:25:48.049: >> HELLO. CAN YOU HEAR ME? RALPH MCKEE?
03:25:51.653: >> Mayor Taylor: YES, WE CAN.
03:25:54.089: >> 1116 RED OAK. I HAVE SOME PROCESS ISSUES THAT I HAVE DISCUSSED PROCESS HERE SEVERAL TIMES BUT I THINK TONIGHT ILLUSTRATES SOME PROBLEMS. IT'S TROUBLING THAT THESE ITEMS HIT THE AGENDA VERY LATE. THAT NOT ONLY LIMITS ANALYSIS OF COUNCILMEMBERS OR STAKEHOLDERS, BUT WHAT ABOUT THE GENERAL PUBLIC? LET'S ASSUME THAT THIS R.A.A. CONTRACT, IT'S $7 MILLION. LET'S ASSUME THERE WERE SOME ISSUES IN THAT CONTRACT, WOULD YOU REALLY EXPECT THE GENERAL PUBLIC TO GO THROUGH A CONTRACT LIKE THAT OVER THE WEEKEND? CONTACT THEIR COUNCILMEMBER, REPRESENTATIVE, TO DISCUSS THOSE ISSUES THEY FOUND? THAT'S FRANKLY, CRAZY. AND SO IF THE -- IF THE MATTER ISN'T URGENT, IT SHOULDN'T BE PUT ON LATE, PERIOD, EVER. IF YOU ARE CARE ABOUT THE PUBLIC AT ALL. AND THAT APPLIES TO THE SNOW REMOVAL. I UNDERSTAND THAT'S NOT THE SAME KIND OF MOTION, AND A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT, BUT NOT THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE. I DID HEAR ABOUT IT. I HAPNED TO -- I WAS ABLE TO DISCUSS IT WITH COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS ON SUNDAY. BUT WHAT ABOUT THE GENERAL PUBLIC WHO IS -- WHO JUST, YOU KNOW, ISN'T WATCHING THE AGENDA, YOU KNOW, TURNING IT ON FRIDAY EVENING? YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUTHEM A LITTLE BIT. A SIMILAR PROCESS ISSUE, I GOT A POSTCARD ON SATURDAY REMINDING ME O CURRENT RESIDENT SNOW REMOVAL POLICY. WHY THE HECK WAS THAT GOING OUT AT THE END OF THE WINTER? HOW MUCH DID THAT COST? WHOSE IDEA WAS THAT? ON FEBRUARY 27th? SIMILARLY, A POSTCARD NOTICE JUST WENT OUT TO ALL THE LANDLORDS RE THEOSSIBILITY OF GRANDFATHERING ALL RESIDENTIAL NON-PRSTRs. I THINK THAT'S APPROPRIATE, BUT COARE THAT TO THE PLANNING MMISSION IS CSIDERING TOMORR AMENDMENTS FOR A.D.U.s WILL ALLOW NONOWNER OCCUPIED A.D. WITN THREE FEET OTHE LOTINE ON EVERY T WITHIN THEITY,ESPITE URGINGY SEVERAL RIDENTS AFFAS STEFASTLY RUSED TO END NOTICEO T AFFECD PROPTY OWNERS. THES THREE EXAMPLES SHO AN ASTONIING LACK OF CONSIENCY BY THE SFF DECISIO MING O THESE ITEMS. AND I -- I'M RLLY -- IT'SIND GGLI. FEBRUARY 2h AND YOU REFUSE TO SEND OUT NOTICE OF AN A MAJOR ITEM? YOU JUST FLAT REFUSED.
03:28:20.702: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
03:28:22.070: >> ANYWAY, THAT'S -- THE PROCESS IS IMPORTANT. AND THERE'S A LOT OF INCONSISTENCY COMING FROM CITY BODIES RIGHT NOW ON PROCESS. THANK YOU.
03:28:35.350: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
03:28:46.361: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING IN 145, DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT?
03:28:56.104: >> HELLO. CAN YOU LEAR ME?
03:28:57.839: >> Mayor Taylor: YES, WE CAN.
03:28:59.274: >> MY NAME IS ARI SHOOTER. I'M WITH KINDNESS TECH PROGRAM, I'M WORKING WITH THE HOMELESS COMMUNITY. I WASN'T ABLE TO SAY THIS EARLIER BECAUSE I COULDN'T GET A SLOT, BUT I DEFINITELY BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO FIND ALTERNATES OF ARMED RESPONDERS TO MENTAL HEALTH, ESPECIALLY IN THE HOMELESS COMMUNITY AS I'M DOING WHAT I DO, I SEE A LOT OF POLICE WHO ARE JUST LIKE DRIVING AROUND WARMING CENTERS AND DRIVING AROUND SHELTERS AND IT KIND OF LOOKS LIKE THEY ARE LOOKING FOR A PROBLEM TO SOLVE. IT NEEDS TO STOP. IT'S UNACCEPTABLE. THERE ARE NOT AS MANY CRIMES AS PEOPLE LIKE TO THINK THEY ARE, AND THESE SMALL ISSUES THAT ARE ESCALATED BY ARMED RESPONDERS LIKE THE POLICE DO NOTHING BUT PACK THE SYSTEM WITH PEOPLE WHO DON'T DESERVE TO BE THERE. ANOTHER THING I WANT TO SAY IS JEFF HAYNER, WHAT YOU SAID TO LISA DISCH WAS UNACCEPTABLE, PERIOD. SHE APOLOGIZED. SHE MADE A SMALL RESPECT AND THE WAY YOU RESPONDED TO THAT WAS AGGRESSIVE AND UNNECESSARY. YOU SPEAK OF DECORUM AND CIVILITY BUT YOU OFFER NEITHER. IF YOU WANT CIVILITY AND DECORUM, YOU EARN IT. IT'S NOT -- IF NOT, CUT THE BULLSHIT. YOU NEED TO GO. AND ME AND MICHELLE HUGHES, WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT HAPPENS IN 2022. COUNT YOUR DAYS. RAMLAWI, IF YOU CAN'T DO YOUR JOB, RESIGN. PERIOD. YOU KNOW, IF I COME TO WORK WITHOUT MY NAME TAG, THEY'LL SEND ME HOME. SO YOU COMING UNPREPARED TO MEETINGS WHERE YOU ARE MAKING POLICY DECISIONS IS UNACCEPTABLE. IF YOU CAN'T DO YOUR BUSINESS AND COUNCILMEMBERS DUTIES RESIGN. TAKE CARE OF YOUR BUSINESS. DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO, BUT DON'T GET IN THE WAY. HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.
03:31:00.328: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
03:31:07.235: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING IN 340, DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT?
03:31:15.543: >> YES, GREETINGS MR. MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL. THIS IS LUIS VASQUEZ FROM THE FIRST WARD. MR. MAYOR, I JUST WANTED TO EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION FOR YOUR APPLYING YOUR VETO TO THE STREET CLOSURE. YOU KNOW, IT'S A SIGN OF LEADERSHIP AND I'M GRATEFUL TO HAVE A MAYOR AND A COUNCIL THAT CAN TAKE A LOOK BACK AND MAKE CORRECTIONS TO DECISIONS THAT ARE MADE. AS YOU KNOW, I THINK THIS WAS A WISE DECISION FOR A FEW REASONS. THE RATES OF INFECTION, NEW INFECTIONS OF COVID-19 ARE STILL HIGH, ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY, INCLUDING IN MICHIGAN, WHERE YESTERDAY WE HAD 1,000 NEW CASES OF COVID-19 IDENTIFIED. 50,000 ACROSS THE U.S., WHICH ARE THE NUMBERS THAT EXISTED DURING THE SECOND SURGE BACK IN JUNE, JULY, AND AUGUST OF 2020. SO, YOU KNOW, AS MORE PEOPLE GET VACCINATED, AS THOSE RATES EVER INFECTION COME DOWN OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS, MY HOPE IS THAT IT WILL BE SAFE ENOUGH FOR ALL OF US TO BE ABLE TO GO OUTDOORS AND DINE ON MAIN STREET AGAIN. AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO HEALTHY STREETS ACTIVITY. AND IF PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED STILL ABOUT THE BUSINESSES IN OUR TOWN, DO -- DO US ALL A FAVOR. PUT YOUR MONEY WHY YOUR MOUTH IS. GO OUT AND BUY SOME GIFT CARDS FROM JOLLY PUMPKIN, FROM ALL THE GREAT ESTABLISHMENTS THAT WE HAVE ON MAIN STREET. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.
03:33:35.316: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
03:33:42.523: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING IN 684, DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT?
03:33:47.362: >> YES, EYE HI, THIS IS ERR SURG FROM ANN ARBOR, MICHIGAN. THE FIRST THING I WOULD LIKE TO MENTION IS I BELIEVE COUNCILMEMBER NELSON AND RAMLAWI MENTIONED THAT THE ACLU REACHED OUT TO THEM. SO, I THINK WE SHOULD CALL THE ACLU AND LET THEM KNOW THAT JOE SPALDING THINKS IT'S A WASTE OF THEIR TIME. AND THAT THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE REACHED OUT TO COUNCILMEMBER NELSON OR RAMLAWI. NUMBER TWO, COUNCILMEMBER RADINA, WHEN THE LETTER WAS SENT TO THE SCHOOL SYSTEM, I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR FACEBOOK POST OF YOU HOW YOU REACHED OUT TO COMMUNICATE LEADERS AND SPOKE TO DIFFERENT -- COMMUNITY LEADERS AND SPOKE TO DIFFERENT PEOPLE, HOWEVER, I WAS INFORMED THAT YOU DID NOT SPEAK TO ERNESTO QULLERO WHO IS A PERSON OF COLOR WHO IS YOUR WARD, WHICH IS KIND OF CONCERNING TO ME. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO KNOW FOR DC MIFFDC-5, WHY IT WAS PUT ON THE AGENDA SO LATE. JUST KIND OF -- I THINK THAT'S A FAIR QUESTION TO BE ANSWERED. AND I THINK THE FOURTH THING I WOULD LIKE TO SAY AND I WASN'T GOING TO SAY. THIS I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE FOUR COUNCILMEMBERS WHO VOTED AGAINST THE STREET CLOSURES BECAUSE THEY HAD THE COURAGE TO DO IT IN THE FIRST PLACE AND KNEW WHAT WAS RIGHT IN THE FIRST PLACE. THANK YOU. AND I HOPE EVERYONE IS NOT TOO TIRED AND WE DON'T HAVE TO REVOTE MUCH MORE. THANK YOU.
03:35:32.467: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT? CLERK CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING IN 736, DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT?
03:35:54.455: >> YES, HI. THIS IS TRISCHE DUCKWORTH, COMING TO YOU AGAIN. I WANTED TO SPEAK YOU TO ALL BRIEFLY ABOUT -- NUMBER ONE, I AGREE WITH THE CALLER WITH MR. HAYNER'S CONTINUED BEHAVIOR. SIR, I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON AT THE CORE OF YOUR SOUL, BUT AS A SOCIAL WORKER, I SEE YOU AS A HURT PERSON. YOU BULLY SOME OF THE PEOPLE, YOUR COLLEAGUES AND IT'S RIDICULOUS HOW YOU JUST DID COUNCILWOMAN DISCH. THAT'S JUST -- THAT'S JUST TOUGH. YOU SHOULD LEARN COMMON RESPECT FOR YOUR COLLEAGUES. I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO THIS COUNCIL ABOUT ONE THING. THERE'S NO RACISM AND RACIST ACTS THAT ARE HAPPENING IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT. THEY HAVE BEEN HAPPENING FOR THE LAST 30 YEARS. YOU DECIDE TO INVOLVE YOURSELF IN A SCHOOL BOARD ISSUE. I GET IT. PEOPLE REACHED OUT TO YOU. YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE DOING WHAT IS BEST BUT PEOPLE ALSO REACHED OUT TO YOU ALL AS WELL ABOUT THE RACISM THAT WAS GOING ON IN THE DISTRICT. AND YOU CHOSE NOT TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT THAT. NONE OF YOU CHOSE TO LEND YOUR IS VOLUNTARIES TO THAT. SO FOR -- VOICES FOR TO THAT. WHEN YOU LISTEN TO THE VOICE OF PRIVILEGE BUT WHEN THE UNDERPRIVILEGE AND THOSE THAT ARE MINORITIES COME YOU TO SAY AND SAY, PLEASE DO SOMETHING, STAND UP. SPEAK OUT ABOUT THIS. WE HEAR IT'S NOT OUR JURISDICTION. WELL, IF IT WASN'T YOUR JURISDICTION TO TALK ABOUT RACISM, IT SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN YOUR JURISDICTION TO TALK ABOUT THEM GOING BACK TO SCHOOL. IT'S JUST RIDICULOUS. TO SEE THAT THE WAY THAT THOSE PRIVILEGED INDIVIDUALS EVEN DONE CRYSTAL DUPRE AND ERNESTO, IT WAS RIDICULOUS AND THEN YOU ALL DEFEND THEM AND SEND IN SUPPORT BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT THEY WANTED. SO CONTINUE TO LISTEN TO THE VOICE OF PRIVILEGED, AND WE ARE SAYING THAT THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE. YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO LISTEN TO ALL OF THE CITIZENS OF ANN ARBOR. YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO LISTEN TO THOSE CITIZENS THAT ASKED YOU TO REACH OUT ABOUT RACISM IN THAT DISTRICT SO IF YOU DID THAT FOR ONE ISSUE, I AM ASKING YOU TO DO IT FOR THE OTHER. THAT IS ONLY RIGHT AND IT SHOULD START FROM THE TOP DOWN WITH THE MAYOR LEADING THE WAY AND EVERYBODY ON THIS BOARD SHOULD SIGN TO THAT STATING THAT RACISM IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS SHOULD NOT BE TOLERATED. I THANK YOU ALL FOR LISTENING TO ME IN THIS SMALL MOMENT BUT I HOPE THAT YOU NOT JUST LISTEN BUT TAKE ACTION TO BATTLE RACISM IN ANN ARBOR AND TO HELP BUILD RACIAL EQUITY, BECAUSE IT IS NECESSARY AND WE WILL NOT TAKE DOWN. WE WILL PUSH EVERY STEP OF THE WAY.
03:38:43.424: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
03:38:55.703: >> Clerk Beaudry: MS. BANNISTER, DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT? MS. BANNISTER, YOU CAN UNMUTE YOURSELF. DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT? MS. BANNISTER. DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT? WE DON'T HEAR YOU.
03:39:57.265: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THIS ANYONE PUBLIC COMMENT?LIKE TO SPE AT CLCLK MAYORORK SEE ANYONE ELSE WITH THEIR HANDS UP.

NOT ONLY OUR COUNC RES, OR PARLIAMENTARIAN RULES, COUNCIL RULE, NO MEMBER SHOULD SPEAK UNLESS RECOGNIZED BY THE PRESIDING OFFICER. ANOTHER RULE UNDER COUNCIL RULE 10, ALTHOUGH I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THEM NUMBERED INSTEAD OF BULLET POINT WHICH I ASKED FOR IN WRITING, WAS THAT THE MEMBERS SPEAK THEIR OWN VIEWS AND MOTIVES, AND SO IT'S OKAY TO -- I PRESUME IT'S OKAY TO SAY I WAS PREPARED FOR THIS MEETING. I RECEIVED THIS BY FRIDAY BUT STILL HAD PLENTY OF TIME. IT'S NOT OKAY TO SAY YOU SHOULD HAVE -- YOU SHOULD HAVE, YOU SHOULD HAVE. AND SO I TAKE OFFENSE WITH THAT TOO, BUT I DIDN'T CALL A POINT OF ORDER FOR THAT BECAUSE I'M NOT GOING TO BE PICKY ABOUT THIS. WHEN IT COMES TO VOTING AND THINGS, IT'S FINE TO BACK UP THAT VOTE AND I UNDERSTAND THAT PEOPLE CAN BE LOST, BUT IT KAZ CLEARLY ANNOUNCED THAT -- IT WAS CLEARLY ANNOUNCED THAT THAT WAS WHAT WE WERE VOTING ON. I HEARD IT. THAT'S WHEN I CALL A POINT OF WHEN RULES ARE NOT BEING -- POINT OF ORDER, WHEN RULES ARE BEING FOLLOWED. EARNEVERYONE HAS THE RIGHT TO HE THE RULES FOLLOWED. I THINK ONE OF OUR CALLERS SPOKE ACCURATELY TO THE NOTION THAT IT DOESN'T GIVE US ENOUGH TIME WHEN THINGS HAPPEN ON A FRIDAY IF THEY ARE NOT URGENT. AND SO I WILL ALSO REQUEST THAT ANY RESPONSES THAT I GET TO MY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE R.A.A. CONTRACT, I'M GOING NO MOVE TO FILE THEM WITH THE CLERK AT OUR NEXT MEETING SO THAT THEY BECOME PART OF THE QUESTIONS OF THE BODY, THAT THE PUBLIC CAN HAVE ACCESS TO. THANK YOU.
03:42:09.864: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
03:42:12.867: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, MAYOR. YEAH, I WILL JUST PIGGYBACK ON THAT A LITTLE BIT. YOU KNOW, I BELIEVE I'M -- I COME TO THESE MEETINGS PREPARED. I STUDY OUR AGENDAS, EMAILS, ATTACHMENTS. I GO TO MY MEETINGS. I RUN A BUSINESS. I CAN DO IT. TO SUGGEST THAT I CAN'T DO THIS JOB OR I'M OVERWHELMED AND I SHOULD RESIGN BECAUSE I COME UNPREPARED, I THINK FOLKS AT THIS TABLE AND IN OUR COMMUNITY BY AND LARGE KNOW THAT'S NOT TRUE. AND WHAT I'M UNMEETED FOR IS -- UNPREPARED FOR IS LAST-MINUTE ADDITIONS AS A RESIDENT JUST SPOKE TO AS WELL. IT'S NOT ONLY FOR US, BUT OUR COMMUNITY. MANY OF THEM COME TO US WHEN THEY SEE SOMETHING ON A RESOLUTION THAT RAISES QUESTIONS, OR CONCERNS. AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN ADDRESS THIS IN IN ADMIN COMMITTEE TO ELIMINATE LAST-MINUTE AND THEY WOULD REQUIRE SIX VOTES OF COUNCIL TO BE PUT ON AFTER WEDNESDAY, THE PRECEDING OF THE COUNCIL MEETINGS OR SOMETHING CLOSE TO THAT. WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO ASK QUESTIONS AND GET WRITTEN RESPONSES TO THOSE. AND NOT HAVE TO PUT IT IN AT 9:30 MONDAY MORNING. SORRY. I'M IN THE INDUSTRY. I WORK -- I WORK FOR A LIVING, BELIEVE IT OR NOT. ANYWHERE FROM 40 TO 70 HOURS A WEEK ON TOP OF COUNCIL. AND I CAN DO IT. I HAVE SHOWN TO DO IT, BUT I WILL MOVE ON, AND I WILL JUST SAY I HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH OUR CITY ADMINISTRATOR ABOUT ENFORCEMENT OF SNOW. I KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT IT EARLIER, ABOUT BEING HIT WITH HEAVY FINES. I KNOW ONE CONSTITUENT THAT WAS HIT WITH TWO FINES IN ONE WEEK FOR $140 EACH. AND SO I WILL BE HOPEFULLY BRINGING AN AMENDMENT TO CHANGE OUR ORDINANCE TO REDUCE THAT AMOUNT TO SOMETHING THAT I BELIEVE IS MORE REASONABLE, BECAUSE I THINK IT'S HEAVY HANDED. AND FURTHERMORE, JUST THE POSTCARDS ON THE SNOW, I DID THINK THAT WAS A WASTE OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS. THANK YOU.
03:44:35.509: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
03:44:38.913: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. I -- I'M SORRY -- THANK YOU. I WOULD -- I WANT TO RESPOND TO ONE OF THE CALLERS ABOUT -- ABOUT THE SCHOOLS TO MS. DUCKWORTH AND HER COMMENTS AND I WANT TO -- I WILL SPEAK TO MY OWN MOTIVATION IN THAT SIGNING ON TO THAT LETTER, IT WAS TO TRY TO ADDRESS A COUPLE OF THINGS. ONE THAT THERE WAS A SPECIFIC VOTE THAT WAS COMING UP AND TWO, THAT I ALSO FELT THAT OUR ACTS WERE REALLY TRYING TO HELP ADDRESS THE VACCINE SUPPLY ISSUE, PARTICULARLY FOR OUR TEACHERS IN OUR COMMUNITY. I -- AS A MEMBER OF THE CITY SCHOOLS COMMITTEE, IT IS -- IT IS MY, YOU KNOW -- NOT JUST HOPE, BUT COMMITMENT THAT I -- I HOPE THAT WE CAN -- AND I PLAN TO HAVE THESE KINDS OF THE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT RACE WITH OUR COLLEAGUES ON THE SCHOOL BOARD. THERE WASN'T A SPECIFIC ACTION THAT WE WERE, YOU KNOW, GOING TO WRITE TO YOU, BUT IF THERE IS IN THE FUTURE, I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY WE -- WE MAY CHOOSE TO CROSS THAT LINE THAT WE HAVEN'T CHOSEN TO CROSS BEFORE. I ALSO JUST WANT TO THANK EVERYONE WOULD DID HELP, YOU KNOW, GET OUR TEACHERS ON THE ROAD TO VACCINATION. IT WAS REALLY INSPIRING AND SPECIFICALLY CALL OUT ANN ARBOR RESIDENTS ■BETHWINSTEIN, WHO ORGANIZED THIS TERRIFIC DRIVE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN TO HAND OUT FREE DONORS TO TEACHERS WHO WERE GETTING VACCINES AND I WAS GLAD TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT EFFORT FOR A SHORT TIME. BUT I THINK IT WAS ALSO IMPORTANT TO -- TO SUPPORT OUR TEACHERS AND -- BECAUSE -- BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN, YOU KNOW, JUST -- THEIR EFFORTS HAVE BEEN HERCULEAN THIS YEAR. THANKS.
03:46:34.461: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
03:46:35.996: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I HAVE A COMMENT THAT I HAVE DEBATED JUST MAKING PRIVATELY TO COUNCILMEMBER DISCH BUT I THINK IT'S WORTH STATING PUBLICLY. I HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE CONFUSION AROUND THE VOTING AND I -- I THINK IT'S WORTH REMARKING OR SHARING THAT THE NEW COUNCILMEMBERS THAT ARE SITTING AT OUR VIRTUAL TABLE ARE EXPERIENCING A VERY DIFFERENT KIND OF BEGINNING TO THEIR TERM THAN WE EXPERIENCED AND I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE PUBLICLY THAT PROBABLY INTERINTERRUPTING THE CHAIR OF OUR MEETING FOR WHAT WE WERE VOTING ON. IT WAS VERY UNUSUAL TONIGHT TO HAVE THE ACTUAL PROCESS OF A VOTE INTERRUPTED, AND I DO UNDERSTAND THE RESPONSE TO THAT, AND FEELING LIKE THAT WAS VERY STRANGE AND BIZARRE. TO POP IN AND INTERRUPT THE CHAIR OF THE MEETING RATHER THAN MS. BEAUDRY IS ALSO DELAYED BY SEVERAL MOMENTS BUZZ YOU HAVE TO QUICKLY UNMUTE YOURSELF AND I JUST -- I JUST WANT TO EXPRESS COMPASSION FOR THE FACT THAT IT'S HARDER NOW. AND SO WHAT HAPPENED TONIGHT WAS LEGITIMATELY REMARKABLE BUT I JUST WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I HAVE ASKED FOR -- I WAS ABLE AT THE TABLE IN OUR LIVE MEETINGS TO ASK FOR CLARIFICATION MORE THAN ONCE ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT WE WERE VOTING ON. I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT. THANK YOU.
03:48:09.490: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER COMMUNICATION FROM COUNCIL? COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS.
03:48:16.396: >> Councilmember Briggs: I GUESS I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SECOND COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI'S REQUEST FOR THE
