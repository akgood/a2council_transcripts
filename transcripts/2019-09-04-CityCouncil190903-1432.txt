00:01:28.877: >> CITY ADMIN. LAZARUS:  WE DO, MAYOR. WITH THE END OF LABOR DAY AND THE UNOFFICIAL END OF SUMMER, OUR STUDENTS ARE NOW RETURNING TO SCHOOL. OUR POLICE ARE WORKING TO RAISE AWARENESS OF ISSUES AROUND THE COMMUNITY RELATED TO PEDESTRIAN AND BICYCLE SAFETY. OUR OFFICERS WILL BE OUT TO PROMOTE SAFETY AWARENESS. TO QUOTE CHIEF COX, WE WANT TO WELCOME STUDENTS BACK AND ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO ENJOY A SAFE SCHOOL YEAR. KINDLY VISIT THE CITY'S WEBSITE FOR MORE A2B SAFETY RESOURCES AND TIPS. WE ALSO PAY TRIBUTE TO THE HARDWORKING MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY, INCLUDING CITY STAFF. OUR PARKS AND RECREATION STAFF OFTEN WORK THREE-DAY WEEKENDS SO THAT WE CAN ENJOY ALL THAT THE CITY HAS TO OFFER, AND WE'D LIKE TO OFFER THEM A HEARTY THANK YOU FOR MAKING OUR CITY RECREATIONAL TIME AVAILABLE YEAR ROUND. TOURS ALLOW THE PUBLIC TO SEE MORE PROPERTIES THAN THEY WOULD IF THEY TOOK OUR BUS TOUR, AND THEY HIGHLIGHT THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OVER THE FIRST 15 YEARS OF THE GREENBELT PROGRAM. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ANNOUNCE THAT CTN HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED FOR SEVERAL HONORS IN THE 2019 PHILO MEDIA FESTIVAL OF ARTS AWARD. THEY WERE RECOGNIZED WITH APPLICATIONS FROM OVER 175 ENTRIES AT ITS ANNUAL CONFERENCE IN OCTOBER. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK OFFICER HERR WHO IS PRESENT THIS EVENING TO PROVIDE SUPPORT TO US, AND WE HAVE AN INTRODUCTION ITEM THIS EVENING. MS. SCOTT FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN IS HERE ALONG WITH MR. RAINE, AND AS THEY APPROACH THE PODIUM, I WOULD GIVE THEM ONE SAFETY RECOMMENDATION AS WE APPROACH THIS WEEKEND, AND THAT IS TO ALWAYS FEAR THE MULE.
00:03:48.417: >> WELL, HOWARD, MAYOR TAYLOR, CITY COUNCIL, I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY THAT WE HAVE -- MYSELF AND THE UNIVERSITY TO APPEAR IN FRONT OF YOU THIS EVENING. WE ARE HERE AT THE INVITATION OF HOWARD LAZARUS TO PRESENT THIS CAMPUS PLANNING UPDATE. IN JULY, SUGAT, WHO IS OUR CAMPUS PLANNER -- IN JULY, SUE PRESENTED THIS SAME SERIES OF SLIDES TO OUR REGENTS. THAT SAME WEEK, I HAD MET WITH HOWARD TO WALK HIM THROUGH THE SLIDES, JUST TO MAKE SURE WE WERE ALL ON THE SAME PAGE. IN EARLY AUGUST, AN INVITATION WAS FORWARDED TO U OF M TO SUSAN'S OFFICE TO MAKE THIS SAME PRESENTATION AT AN AGREEABLE COUNCIL MEETING, AND THIS DATE WORKED OUT, SO WE ARE APPRECIATIVE OF THIS OPPORTUNITY AND LOOK FORWARD TO THIS PRESENTATION. WE ARE GOING TO BE BOTH AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS AFTERWARDS, AND I WOULD LIKE TO THROW OUT THAT I UNDERSTAND IT'S A FULL AGENDA. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A CAMPUS PLANNING UPDATE, WHICH IS KIND OF A BROAD OVERVIEW, BUT SUSAN AND I WOULD BE VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN COMING IN FRONT OF THE COUNCIL AT A WORKING SESSION IN THE FUTURE TO GET INTO SOME MORE DETAILS, SOME QUESTIONS THAT MAY COME UP AT A FUTURE DATE, SO AT AN AGREEABLE AMOUNT OF TIME WHEN THE COUNCIL HAS THAT, WE WOULD OPEN UP THAT POSSIBILITY. SO, SUSAN, I'LL TURN IT OVER TO YOU.
00:05:27.682: >> OKAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. BECAUSE OF THE LIMITED TIME, I PLAN TO FOCUS ON OUR CENTRAL AND NORTH CAMPUS ACADEMIC CENTERS, BUT I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL TO BEGIN WITH A BRIEF OVERVIEW. SO, AS YOU WILL SEE, THE CURRENT PROJECTS THAT I'LL BE SHOWING YOU ADDRESS REALLY FOUR OVERARCHING THEMES. FIRST, WE ARE ENHANCING CAMPUS LIFE FOR OUR STUDENTS, FACULTY, STAFF, PATIENTS, AND VISITORS, AND THEREBY SUPPORTING OUR MISSION. AND I'M GOING TO DESCRIBE SOME EXAMPLES OF THOSE IN A FEW MINUTES. SECOND, WE MAINTAIN AN IMPORTANT EMPHASIS ON SUSTAINABILITY, AND WE EXPLORE OPPORTUNITIES TO MEET AND EXCEED OUR GOALS BY WORKING CREATIVELY WITH PROJECT PLANS. THIRD, OUR PROJECTS HONOR OUR HISTORY AND TRADITIONS WHILE REMAINING FLEXIBLE FOR FUTURE PROGRAMMATIC NEEDS AND INNOVATIONS, AND I'LL BE SHOWING YOU SOME EXAMPLES OF THOSE AS WELL. AND FINALLY, AT THE END OF MY BRIEF PRESENTATION, I'LL BE DISCUSSING CONNECTIVITY. WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON OPPORTUNITIES TO STRENGTHEN CONNECTIVITY, BOTH WITHIN OUR CAMPUSES, BETWEEN OUR CAMPUSES, AND WITH THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE. SO, BEFORE GOING INTO SPECIFIC PROJECTS, I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL TO GIVE A QUICK CAMPUS OVERVIEW. THIS IS AN AERIAL OF OUR FIVE CAMPUSES. WE HAVE A VERY ROBUST ENTERPRISE, AS I AM SURE YOU KNOW, WITH ROUGHLY 3,000 ACRES IN THE ANN ARBOR AREA, AND ABOUT 36.5 MILLION SQUARE FEET OF SPACE. WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY 46,000 STUDENTS, AND IN PART DRIVEN BY THE GROWTH OF OUR HOSPITALS, WE HAVE 49,000 FACULTY AND STAFF. WE ALSO GENERATE ABOUT $1.55 BILLION ANNUALLY IN RESEARCH ACTIVITY, AND IN ADDITION, WE RECEIVE ABOUT 2.5 MILLION HOSPITAL VISITS EACH YEAR, AND ON AN ACADEMIC YEAR, WE HAVE ABOUT 1.3 MILLION VISITORS TO OUR HOME VARSITY EVENTS. SO WE HAVE A LOT GOING ON. TAKING YOU QUICKLY THROUGH EACH OF OUR FIVE CAMPUSES, THEY SPAN, IF YOU WERE TO DRAW AN ARC -- LET'S SEE IF I CAN GET MY BALL HERE -- FROM ROUGHLY THE CORE OF THE ATHLETIC CAMPUS UP TO EAST MEDICAL CAMPUS, WE HAVE ABOUT A SIX-MILE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE CAMPUSES, SO STARTING WITH THE ROSS ATHLETIC CAMPUS, IT'S ABOUT 350 ACRES WITH OVER 2.5 MILLION GROWTH SQUARE FEET, AND THE CAMPUS SPANS FROM THE NORTH AT HOOVER, SOUTH ACROSS THE FOOTBALL STADIUM, FERRY FIELD, THE GOLF COURSE, TO OUR SOUTH COMPLEX, AND THEN YOU'LL NOTICE WE ALSO HAVE SOME PROPERTIES AROUND BRIARWOOD AND SOUTH OF I-94. MOVING ON TO CENTRAL CAMPUS, THIS IS REALLY OUR BELOVED HISTORIC CORE OF CAMPUS. IT'S ABOUT 350 ACRES WITH OVER 14 MILLION GROWTH SQUARE FEET OF SPACE, AND IT STRETCHES FROM THE SOUTH BOUNDARY BEING HOOVER, NORTH ACROSS PACKARD, THROUGH THE DIAG AND UP TO HURON ON THE NORTH, AND THEN EAST IT EXTENDS ALL THE WAY PAST EAST MEDICAL CENTER DRIVE TO INCLUDE THE NICHOLS ARBORETUM. OUR MEDICAL CENTER CAMPUS IS OUR MOST DENSELY DEVELOPED CAMPUS. IT'S LOCATED IMMEDIATELY NORTH AND CONTIGUOUS TO CENTRAL CAMPUS, AND IT EXTENDS UP TO NORTH INGLES, PROPERTIES ON BOTH SIDES OF WALL STREET, AND IT'S ROUGHLY 100 ACRES IN SIZE WITH OVER 10 MILLION GROWTH SQUARE FEET OF SPACE. OUR LARGEST, IN TERMS OF GEOGRAPHIC AREA OF THE FIVE CAMPUSES, IS NORTH CAMPUS. IT'S ABOUT A THOUSAND ACRES, BUT TODAY ONLY HAS ABOUT 8 MILLION GROWTH SQUARE FEET OF SPACE. SO, IT'S REALLY OF THE FIVE CAMPUSES THE AREA WHERE WE HAVE THE GREATEST POTENTIAL FOR FUTURE GROWTH AND THE GREATEST AVAILABLE REMAINING CAPACITY. IT EXTENDS FROM FULLER ROAD UP TO PLYMOUTH ROAD, TO GREEN ROAD ON THE EAST SIDE AND THE SORT OF SOUTHEAST CORNER IS BORDERED BY HURON HIGH SCHOOL. I'M ALSO A FORMER RIVER RAT, I'M HAPPY TO POINT OUT, HURON HIGH SCHOOL. MOVING ON, OUR FIFTH CAMPUS, EAST MEDICAL CAMPUS, THAT'S LOCATED IN ANN ARBOR TOWNSHIP, AND THAT'S ABOUT 200 ACRES, 500,000 GROWTH SQUARE FEET TODAY, SO IT'S THE SMALLEST IN TERMS OF EXISTING SPACE, AND IT'S HOME TO SEVERAL OF OUR OUTPATIENT CLINICS. YOU'LL ALSO SEE ON THE SAME GRAPHIC THAT I'M SHOWING SOME ADDITIONAL PROPERTIES THAT WE OWN WITHIN THE ANN ARBOR TOWNSHIP, AND THAT INCLUDES THE ANN ARBOR TECHNOLOGY PARK, MATHAI BOTANICAL GARDENS AND ARBOR LAKES LOCATED NORTHEAST OF MEDICAL CAMPUS. THE SUM OF THESE PROPERTIES IN ANN ARBOR TOWNSHIP IS ROUGHLY A THOUSAND ACRES, SO THAT'S ABOUT ONE THIRD OF THE TOTAL LAND HA HOLDINGS IN THE ANN ARBOR AREA. I'M GOING TO MOVE ON AND COVER SOME PROJECTS, AND I'LL START WITH MICHIGAN UNION. I MENTIONED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PRESENTATION THAT WE HAVE THESE FOUR OVERARCHING THEMES. SO THE UNION IS REALLY A GREAT EXAMPLE OF A PROJECT THAT WILL BE IMPROVING OUR EXPERIENCE FOR STUDENTS AND ALSO CREATING A STRONG REINVESTMENT STRATEGY FOR A HISTORIC HERITAGE BUILDING. NEXT TO THE MICHIGAN UNION IS THE LS&A BUILDING. THAT'S ALSO A MISSION-DRIVEN BUILDING TO PROMOTE ENHANCEMENTS FOR OUR ACADEMIC MISSION AS WELL AS OUR STUDENT EXPERIENCE, AND TO THE WEST THAT, YOU'LL SEE THE FLEMING BUILDING. THAT IS A FUTURE REDEVELOPMENT ZONE, SO WE ARE SHOWING DEMOLITION AS WELL AS THE AVAILABILITY OF THAT SITE FOR SOME FUTURE USE. MOVING ON TO THE NORTH, THE KRAUSE BUILDING, THAT'S ALSO UNDER CONSTRUCTION RIGHT NOW, AND IT'S ANOTHER GREAT EXAMPLE OF A HERITAGE BUILDING RENOVATION, AND IT PROMOTES MORE ACADEMIC GROWTH AND NEW INITIATIVES. FURTHER TO THE EAST IS THE DENTAL BUILDING. THAT IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION. IT'S A COMBINATION OF A RENOVATION WITH SOME INFILL AND NEW DEVELOPMENT, AND FURTHER EAST IS THE FUTURE NEW CLASSROOM BUILDING FOR CENTRAL CAMPUS. THAT NEW CLASSROOM BUILDING BRINGS MORE THAN 1,400 NEW CLASSROOM SEATS, WHICH FURTHER SUPPORT OUR MISSION FOR EDUCATING STUDENTS. AND THEN CONTIGUOUS TO THAT IS THE RUTHEN BUILDING. THAT'S ANOTHER HISTORIC BUILDING UNDER RENOVATION FOR OUR ADMINISTRATION. IF YOU CROSS WASHTENAW, YOU'LL SEE WE ARE SHOWING THE REDEVELOPMENT OF THE CCRB SITE, CENTRAL CAMPUS RECREATION BUILDING. THAT'S IN EARLY DESIGN RIGHT NOW. THAT WILL BE A REALLY, REALLY EXCITING PROJECT FOR OUR STUDENTS TO HAVE SOME NEW STATE-OF-THE-ART RECREATION FACILITIES. MOVING ON TO THE NORTH, THE CENTRAL POWER PLANT, THAT'S A PROJECT THAT SUPPORTS OUR COMMITMENT TO IMPROVED RELIABLE POWER, AND IT WAS A PROJECT RECOMMENDED BY THE 2015 UNIVERSITY GREENHOUSE GAS COMMITTEE. JUST NORTH OF THAT IS IS THE SITE FOR A FUTURE PHARMACY BUILDING, AND THAT'S IN EARLY PLANNING. TO THE NORTH OF THAT IS A SITE FOR A FUTURE INPATIENT CLINICAL TOWER. THAT IS A PROJECT THAT WILL HELP SUPPORT OUR CLINICAL MISSION AND WOULD REALLY BRING SOME IMPORTANT IMPROVEMENTS FOR OUR PATIENT EXPERIENCE. FURTHER NORTH IS THE WALL STREET WEST PARKING DECK, WHICH IS CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION TO SUPPORT INSTITUTIONAL NEEDS. AND THEN I'M GOING TO COME BACK TO MARKLY IN JUST A MOMENT AS WELL AS SOUTH 5th AVENUE, BUT I WANT TO FIRST CONTINUE ON WITH HOUSING AND TALK JUST A LITTLE BIT ABOUT TODAY'S FOOTPRINT FOR HOUSING ON CENTRAL CAMPUS. WE HAVE ABOUT 8200 BEDS TODAY ON CENTRAL CAMPUS, AND YOU PROBABLY CAN REMEMBER THAT MANY OF THOSE BEDS WERE RENOVATED OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS, SO WE HAVE RECENTLY RENOVATED AND REINVESTED IN, FOR EXAMPLE, WEST QUAD, EAST QUAD, ALL OF THE HILL DORMS, INCLUDING STOCKWELL, MOSSIER, JORDAN, ALICE, LLOYD, COUSINS. WE BUILT ABOUT TEN OR 11 YEARS AGO NORTH QUAD, WHICH BRINGS US ABOUT 450 NEW BEDS ON CAMPUS. THAT WAS A STRONG INTEREST WITH THE CITY, AND THEN WE MORE RECENTLY ADDED THE NEW MUNGER GRADUATE RESIDENCE, WHICH BRINGS US ABOUT 630 NEW BEDS. SO, TO SUPPORT THIS CONTINUED INVENTORY OF BEDS ON CENTRAL CAMPUS, LOOKING OUT INTO OUR FUTURE, WE ARE GOING TO NEED TO LOOK FOR A SUCCESSOR TO MARKLEY. MARKLEY IS UP HERE. IT'S ABOUT 60 YEARS OLD, AND IT'S LOCATED DIRECTLY ACROSS THE STREET TO THE SOUTH FROM THE VON VOIGT LANDER MOTT HOSPITAL. IT'S ALSO IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE NEW PROPOSED CLINICAL INPATIENT TOWER, SO IT'S VERY CLOSE TO QUITE A BIT OF CLINICAL NEW ACTIVITY, AND THIS SITE OFFERS US REALLY AN OPPORTUNITY LONG TERM TO REPURPOSE THE SITE TO BETTER MEET OUR LONG TERM PATIENT AND CLINICAL MISSION, AND IN DOING SO, WE THINK THAT ALLOWS US AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONSIDER THE SOUTH 5th AVENUE AREA AS A SUITABLE AND PROBABLY IN SOME RESPECTS A MORE ADVANTAGED LOCATION FOR REPLACING THOSE BEDS. THAT'S AN AREA WHICH IS ACTUALLY A BIT CLOSER TO THE DIAG IN TERMS OF WALKING DISTANCE, AND IT IS ALSO IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE FIELD AS WELL AS TO THE I.M. BUILDING, SO THERE ARE TWO REALLY APPRECIATED RECREATION SPORTS FACILITIES IN VERY CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THAT AREA ON SOUTH 5th AVENUE. SO, WHILE I'M TALKING ABOUT HOUSING, I NOW WANT TO SHIFT TO NORTH CAMPUS, WHERE WE HAVE ROUGHLY 4,000 BEDS TODAY IN OUR INVENTORY, AND THAT INCLUDES A COMBINATION OF BATES 2, BURRSLEY, AND THE NORTH WOODS, WHICH ARE CALLED ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, AND FIVE IS ACTUALLY LOCATED ON THE EAST SIDE OF HURON PARKWAY. SO, YOU MIGHT REMEMBER IN THE NORTH CAMPUS MASTER PLAN, WHICH WAS PUBLISHED IN 2008, WE DESCRIBED THE LONG-TERM VISION FOR REDEVELOPING THE NORTH WOODS AS THEY REACHED THE END OF THEIR USEFUL LIVES, AND SO WE ARE CONTINUING TO EXPLORE PLANNING FOR THAT OPPORTUNITY, AND THEREFORE OUR SHOWING ON THIS GRAPHIC REDEVELOPMENT AREA THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO REPURPOSE, OVER TIME, SOME BEDS THAT NEED REPLACEMENT ON NORTH CAMPUS. THIS IMAGE IS ALSO SHOWING SOME OTHER EXISTING PROJECTS THAT ARE ONGOING, INCLUDING THE RENOVATION OF BUILDINGS 20 AND 25 AT THE NORTH CAMPUS RESEARCH COMPLEX. WE ARE SHOWING THE FUTURE LOCATION OF A TRANSPORTATION FACILITY, WHICH IS LOCATED WEST OF DEAN ROAD, AND THEN YOU'VE MAYBE BEEN FOLLOWING THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE NEW FORD ROBOTICS LABORATORY, WHICH WILL BE SUPPORTING OUR RESEARCH MISSION, AND I AM SHOWING TWO OTHER IMPORTANT PROJECTS FOR US. ONE IS THE BEISTER ADDITION, AND THIS BUILDING ALLOWS US TO ENHANCE AND EXPAND COMPUTER SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING SPACE TO SUPPORT BOTH ACADEMIC RESEARCH MISSIONS AS WELL AS FOR US TO RELOCATE THE SCHOOL OF INFORMATION WHEN THAT FACILITY IS BUILT, SO THAT WOULD BE BRINGING A NEW UNIT TO NORTH CAMPUS. AND THEN FINALLY, OUR DANCE BUILDING SITE, WHICH IS LOCATED JUST SOUTH OF THE MOORE BUILDING, AND THAT WOULD BE YET ANOTHER UNIT THAT WE WOULD BE BRINGING UP TO NORTH CAMPUS WHEN THAT FACILITY IS CONSTRUCTED. SO, AS WE KIND OF THINK ABOUT ALL OF THIS ACTIVITY, WE ARE REALLY DIRECTING NEW GROWTH AND EXPANSION TO NORTH CAMPUS, AND WITH THE RELOCATION OF BOTH DANCE AND SCHOOL OF INFORMATION, WE'LL HAVE NEARLY ONE THIRD OF OUR STUDENTS ENROLLED IN THE NORTH CAMPUS UNITS, AND WE'LL HAVE ROUGHLY ONE THIRD OF THE STUDENTS WHO LIVE IN UNIVERSITY HOUSING LOCATED IN UNITS ON NORTH CAMPUS IN THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS, AS THESE NEW BUILDINGS COME ONLINE. SO, I MENTIONED AT THE BEGINNING OF MY PRESENTATION THAT WE HAVE A VERY ROBUST ENTERPRISE. MUCH OF THIS ACTIVITY IS SUPPORTED BY OUR TRANSIT SYSTEM, WHICH MOVES BETWEEN OUR CAMPUSES. SEVERAL YEARS AGO, WE REPORTED THAT WE HAD ROUGHLY EIGHT -- OR 7 MILLION PASSENGER TRIPS ANNUALLY ON OUR SYSTEM, AND THAT'S THIS YEAR RISEN TO 8 MILLION PASSENGER TRIPS, SO AT THE TIME WE REPORTED 7 MILLION, WE HAD A DAILY BUS PASSENGER TRIP COUNT OF ABOUT 30,000. AS WE UPDATE THAT NUMBER WITH OUR 8 MILLION TRIPS PER YEAR, WE CAN IMAGINE THAT THE DAILY TRIP IS PROBABLY HIGHER THAN THE 30,000 PREVIOUSLY REPORTED. SO, AS WE ANTICIPATE CONTINUED ACTIVITY ON CENTRAL CAMPUS, THE MEDICAL CAMPUS AND NORTH CAMPUS, IMPROVED CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN OUR CAMPUSES IS REALLY ESSENTIAL TO SUPPORT THE ACADEMIC, THE RESEARCH, AND THE CLINICAL MISSIONS OF THE UNIVERSITY. SO, WE ARE CONTINUING TO EXPLORE OPPORTUNITIES TO INCREASE CAPACITY, TO IMPROVE RELIABILITY, TO ENHANCE SUSTAINABILITY, AND TO PROVIDE GREATER EFFICIENCY THAT MIGHT, FOR EXAMPLE, HELP REDUCE TRAVEL TIMES BETWEEN CAMPUSES, WHICH IS REPORTED AT ABOUT 25 MINUTES, ALTHOUGH I HAVE HAD INTERNS WORKING IN MY OFFICE THAT ALLEGE IT CAN BE AS MUCH AS 45 MINUTES TO GET FROM NORTH CAMPUS TO MY OFFICE DOWN ON HOOVER. SO, WE THINK THIS COULD BE PERHAPS A DEDICATED BUS ROUTE. IT MIGHT BE BUS RAPID TRANSIT. IT COULD BE LIGHT RAIL. MAYBE IT'S A MONORAIL, OR IT COULD EVEN BE A TRAIN. WE REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT TECHNOLOGY IS, BUT WE DO KNOW THAT IT REMAINS AN IMPORTANT PRIORITY FOR US TO ADDRESS SOME NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT WILL IMPROVE THE CAPACITY OVER TODAY'S TRANSIT SYSTEM. SO THAT IS A VERY BRIEF OVERVIEW, AND WITH THAT, I'LL TURN IT BACK OVER TO MIKE FOR ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE.
00:22:09.984: >> WELL, AS I MENTIONED EARLIER, WE ARE BOTH AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS. WE, YOU KNOW, WE APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY. THIS IS A BROAD BRUSH OVERVIEW OF EVERYTHING THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT WITH THE REGENTS' INTERNAL DISCUSSIONS, BUT WE OPEN IT TO QUESTIONS. WE REALIZE IT'S A BUSY AGENDA, AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO FURTHER DISCUSSIONS, WHETHER IT'S AT A WORKING SESSION, INDIVIDUALLY OR OTHERWISE.
00:22:35.876: >> PERHAPS ONE OR TWO QUESTIONS, COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD?
00:22:40.548: >> THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION. I WOULD DEFINITELY SUPPORT A WORKING SESSION, BECAUSE I HAVE WRITTEN DOWN SIX QUESTIONS, AND I KNOW I'M NOT ALLOWED TO ASK THEM TONIGHT.
00:22:52.793: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
00:22:53.894: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  THANK YOU. I SHARE THAT SENTIMENT, BUT I DO HAVE TWO QUICK ONES, BECAUSE THEY ARE ON OUR AGENDA TONIGHT, SO ONE OF THE ITEMS ON OUR AGENDA IS A $600,000 LOWER TOWN MOBILITY STUDY, AND WE KNOW THE CONNECTOR AND THE OTHER PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN KIND OF FLOATING AROUND THERE IN THE PAST, AND MANY OF THOSE THINGS THAT YOU HAVE SHOWN CONNECTED TO CAMPUS IN THE LOWER TOWN AREA EITHER METAPHORICALLY OR PHYSICALLY, SO IS THERE ANY WAY THAT WE CAN PARTNER WITH THE UNIVERSITY ON SOME OF THESE EXPENSIVE STUDIES AND FORWARD THINKING PROJECTS SO WE ARE NOT REINVENTING THE WHEEL IN FIVE OR SIX YEARS WHEN YOU GUYS ARE READY TO DO SOMETHING? I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF CONCERN THAT WE ARE NOT -- YOU KNOW, WE ARE NOT WORKING CLOSELY ENOUGH TOGETHER.
00:23:36.670: >> WELL, I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS, JEFF, WE WANTED TO BE HERE TONIGHT, SO WE COULD START THE DIALOGUE AND MAKE SURE THE CITY UNDERSTOOD WHAT OUR LONG-TERM PLANS ARE. IN THE INTERIM, EVERY PROJECT THAT WE BRING FORWARD INVOLVES A TRAFFIC STUDY THAT WE ARE REQUIRED BY THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR TO DO, SO WE ARE BRINGING THIS FORWARD, WHETHER IT'S THE WALL STREET WEST PARKING DECK, THE CLINICAL INPATIENT TOWER THAT SUSAN MENTIONED, ALL OF THOSE WILL HAVE STUDIES AS PART OF IT. INTERNAL, I THINK WE ARE BOTH ON A TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE THAT IS LOOKING AT THE ENTIRE CITY, JEFF. I WOULD SAY IT'S AT ITS BEGINNING STAGES, BUT THE UNIVERSITY IS INVOLVED WITH THOSE DISCUSSIONS AND HOW THAT COMMITTEE EVOLVES AS WELL.
00:24:27.588: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  ALL RIGHT. THE OTHER CONCERN THAT I THINK RESIDENTS HAVE AND A LOT OF US MIGHT SHARE AT THIS STABLE IS, IS THERE ANY APPETITE FOR THE UNIVERSITY CONSIDERING BUILDING ADDITIONAL HOUSING FOR STAFF, STUDENTS, AND FACULTY TO TAKE SOME OF THE PRESSURE OFF THE HOUSING MARKET HERE IN THE CITY? BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE AN AFFORDABILITY CRISIS, AND A LOT OF THAT IS JUST BASIC DEMAND FOR HOUSING, AND, YOU KNOW, THE OPEN MARKET, AS IT WERE, ISN'T ABLE TO SUPPLY IT IN A QUALITY WAY LIKE THE UNIVERSITY CAN, AND SO I HAVE ALWAYS WONDERED, IS THERE A WAY THAT THE UNIVERSITY MIGHT STEP UP AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE LAND HOLDINGS THAT IT HAS TO CREATE SOME MORE HOUSING?
00:25:08.829: >> WELL, I THINK THAT'S, YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE SEE AS A UNIVERSITY. WE HAVE REALLY TREMENDOUS RESOURCES WE CAN BRING, WHETHER IT'S OUR COMMUNITY-MINDED UNITS, SUCH AS POVERTY SOLUTIONS, THE GINSBURG CENTER EARLIER THIS SPRING BROUGHT SOME COMMUNITY MEMBERS TOGETHER WITH SOME CAMPUS PARTNERS TO TALK ABOUT WORKFORCE HOUSING, AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IT'S CALLED DIFFERENT THINGS. WE SEE THIS THROUGHOUT THE STATE, AND WE HAVE RESOURCES ACADEMICALLY IN RESEARCH AND PLANNING AND ARCHITECTURE, PUBLIC POLICY. IN TERMS OF THE PHYSICAL CONSTRUCTION, EXCEPT FOR STUDENT HOUSING, THAT'S JUST NOT THE MISSION OF THE UNIVERSITY. THE SECOND COMPONENT WITH THAT, JEFF, IS THAT THE UNIVERSITY NEVER WANTS TO PUT ITSELF INTO THE MARKETPLACE AGAINST DEVELOPMENT, WHETHER THAT'S FEDERALLY ASSISTED, STATE ASSISTED, OR PRIVATELY DONE DEVELOPMENT. WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT. OUR MISSION IS FOR STUDENT HOUSING, WHICH IS WHY SUSAN SPECIFICALLY MENTIONED NORTHWOOD AND THE REDEVELOPMENT OF THAT, BECAUSE THERE'S MORE UNITS THAT CAN BE PUT UP THERE. IT WAS BUILT, I THINK, IN THE '60s. I AM NOT SURE, BUT IF YOU HAVE EVER DRIVEN THROUGH THERE, IT CAN BE BETTER PLANNED, SITE PLANNED, AND A BETTER MORE DENSE ARRANGEMENT. SO THAT'S WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT.
00:26:35.716: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI AND LUMM AND PERHAPS CALL IT A DAY. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
00:26:41.188: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  THANK YOU FOR SHOWING UP. IT'S GREAT AND AN HONOR TO BE HERE TO LISTEN TO THIS PRESENTATION. WE HAVE BEEN WAITING QUITE SOME TIME FOR THIS KIND OF THING, FOR US NEW MEMBERS, THAT IS, SO WE APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE, AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO THAT WORK SESSION LATER ON, BECAUSE WE WON'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO COVER EVERYTHING. I WILL PIGGYBACK ON MY COLLEAGUE'S COMMENTS ABOUT THE HOUSING CRISIS, THE AFFORDABILITY CRISIS THAT WE HAVE IN ANN ARBOR. MANY PEOPLE HAVE POINTED TO THE UNIVERSITY AS PART OF THE PROBLEM, AND PERHAPS PART OF THE SOLUTION, AND WE ARE ASKING FOR ALL HANDS ON DECK IN ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE. YOU'VE JUST STATED THAT IT'S NOT PART OF YOUR MISSION FOR YOUR STUDENT BODY, BUT PERHAPS IT SHOULD BE FOR THE EMPLOYEES OF THE UNIVERSITY. YOU STATED A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER WORK AT THE HOSPITAL AND THE SUPPORT STAFF THAT IT TAKES TO OPERATE SUCH A COMPLEX ORGANIZATION IS QUITE SUBSTANTIAL, AND WE APPRECIATE THE BENEFITS OF BEING IN THE COMMUNITY. THE UNIVERSITY IS A GREAT PARTNER, BUT, TO BE FRANK, WE HAVE A CRISIS, WHERE PEOPLE CANNOT AFFORD TO LIVE WHERE THEY WORK, AND IT'S CAUSING A LOT OF CONGESTION PROBLEMS ON OUR ROADWAYS AS WELL AS OTHER CONCERNS AND ISSUES. SO, AS WE COME BACK AND TALK ABOUT THIS IN A FUTURE DATE, HOPEFULLY MORE CAN BE BROUGHT AND SHED SOME LIGHT ON IT. I JUST HAVE A QUICK COMMENT OR QUESTION ON THE FINGERLEY SITE, WHAT KIND OF TIME FRAME ARE WE LOOKING AT, AND WHAT KIND OF HOUSING ARE WE LOSING AT MARKLEY, AND ARE WE LOOKING AT A SUBSTANTIALLY LARGER CONTRIBUTION AT THE FINGERLEY SITE.
00:28:29.997: >> THE ONLY THING THAT I ANSWER AT THIS JUNCTURE, ALI, AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW, WE HAVE CLEARED THE SITE. THE SHORT-TERM USE IS GOING TO BE FOR STAFF AND FACULTY PARKING, ABOUT 240, 250 SPACES. THE REST OF IT IS GOING TO BE CORDONED OFF. RIGHT NOW, DESPITE KIND OF THE GENERAL VIEW OF PERHAPS REPLACING MARKLEY, THAT'S 60 YEARS OLD, WITH SOME RESIDENTIAL IN THAT AREA, IT MAKES SENSE FOR A LOT OF REASONS, BUT IN TERMS OF A SPECIFIC PLAN, NOTHING HAS BEEN DETERMINED AT THIS JUNCTURE.
00:29:09.536: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
00:29:10.370: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  THANKS. JUST QUICKLY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH, SUE AND MIKE FOR COMING. THIS IS VERY INFORMATIVE, AND I TOO WOULD WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A WORKING SESSION WITH YOU AND MAYBE OTHERS SO WE COULD DELVE MORE DEEPLY INTO YOUR MASTER PLANNING PLANS FOR ALL OF THESE CAMPUSES, AND AS A SECOND WARD REPRESENTATIVE, YOU KNOW ONE AREA THAT, YOU KNOW, IS OF GREAT INTEREST TO FOLKS IN AND AROUND THAT AREA ARE YOUR PLANS FOR THE NORTH CAMPUS, WHERE -- AND I APPRECIATE YOU SAID THAT YOU'RE DIRECTING NEW GROWTH AND EXPANSION TO THE NORTH CAMPUS AREA, AND THAT'S BECOME OBVIOUS TO FOLKS IN AND AROUND THAT AREA, AND WE SEE THE RELATED TRAFFIC IMPACTS, AND I KNOW YOU'RE KEYED INTO THE CONCERNS THAT WERE BROUGHT TO YOUR ATTENTION WITH THE INITIAL GARAGE PROPOSAL, AND I APPRECIATE THAT YOU WENT BACK SUBSEQUENTLY, AND, YOU KNOW, IN MULTIPLE MEETINGS WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF NEIGHBORHOODS OUT THERE. IT REALLY TURNED OUT TO BE A GOOD, INCLUSIVE PROCESS, AND SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THAT AS WELL, AND THAT, I HOPE, WOULD INFORM FUTURE PLANS FOR THE CAMPUS, RESEARCH COMPLEX AND NORTH CAMPUS IN GENERAL SO THAT PEOPLE ARE MORE ENGAGED ON THE FRONT END, AND WITH THAT, ANY INFORMATION -- WITH THAT HOPE, ANY INFORMATION COULD BE SHARED VIS-À-VIS THE MASTER PLAN FOR THAT PROPERTY, THE LAST MASTER PLAN WAS IN '08, AND IT WAS COMPLETED JUST PRIOR TO, AS WE KNOW, THE ACQUISITION OF THE PFIZER PROPERTY, SO THAT REALLY CHANGED THE UNIVERSE OUT THERE AND OBVIOUSLY OPENED UP MANY OTHER OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUR EXPANSION OUT THERE. SO, AGAIN, ANY MASTER PLANNING EFFORTS THAT CAN BE SHARED WITH THE GENERAL PUBLIC, NOT JUST US, OBVIOUSLY, WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED, AND THANK YOU FOR AGAIN FOR COMING TONIGHT, AND I THINK, YOU KNOW, WORKING COLLABORATIVELY THIS WAY AND KEEPING EACH OTHER INFORMED, WE CAN ALL PLAN BETTER, AND I CONCUR WITH THE CONCERNS EXPRESSED ABOUT, YOU KNOW -- YOU KNOW, YOU SAID IT'S NOT YOUR MISSION, NECESSARILY, TO PROVIDE HOUSING, BUT AS YOU REPURPOSE THESE BUILDINGS THAT HOUSE PEOPLE, WHETHER IT'S NORTHWOOD OR MARKLEY AND OTHER PARCELS, PROPERTIES, WE DO ALL RECOGNIZE THAT THE PRIVATE SECTOR IS REALLY TAKING THIS ON FOR THE UNIVERSITY, SO, YOU KNOW, I GET WHY THAT MAY, YOU KNOW, YOU WOULD OPT TO DEFER AND ALLOW THAT WHOLE PROCESS TO CONTINUE AS IT HAS UNFOLDED THESE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, BUT THERE IS OBVIOUSLY A NEED TO ADDRESS THE SHARED HOUSING NEEDS POSED BY THE MANY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO COME HERE EVERY DAY TO WORK AT THE UNIVERSITY AND YOUR STUDENT POPULATION, OBVIOUSLY, AS WELL. SO, THANK YOU AGAIN FOR COMING TONIGHT AND I LOOK FORWARD TO MORE EXCHANGES.
00:32:23.396: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER GRAND?
00:32:24.231: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRAND:  THANK YOU. I LOOK FORWARD TO A WORK SESSION AS WELL. AS SOMEONE WHO WORKS ON A DAILY BASIS WITH OUR UNDERGRADUATE POPULATION AND THE PEOPLE WHO SERVE THEM, I DO ALSO WANT TO PUSH BACK ON THAT. MOST OF MY COLLEAGUES WHO SERVE WHO ARE STUDENTS CAN'T AFFORD TO LIVE IN THE CITY. MOST OF THE PEOPLE WORKING TO SERVE MY NEIGHBORHOOD AND IN HEALTH CARE CAN'T AFFORD TO LIVE IN THE CITY, SO I THINK IT IS TIME FOR THE UNIVERSITY TO STEP UP AND UNDERSTAND THAT IT HAS A ROLE TO PLAY HERE, AND IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BUILD IT YOURSELF, YOU HAVE GOT LAND. GIVE IT TO A PRIVATE DEVELOPER AND LEASE IT TO THEM CHEAPLY. LET'S USE THE BRAND POWER THAT WE HAVE AND COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS, BECAUSE I KNOW THAT'S WHAT A LOT OF EXPERTS WILL TELL YOU TO DO WHO WORK ON CAMPUS. I ALSO HOPE IF WE HAVE A WORK SESSION THAT WE'LL HEAR A LITTLE BIT -- AGAIN, AS SOMEONE WHO WORKS WITH STUDENTS, I HAVE DEEP CONCERNS ABOUT, AS THE UNIVERSITY PUSHES FORWARD FOR MORE EQUITY IN BRINGING A LOT OF MORE DIVERSITY IN TERMS OF ITS STUDENT POPULATION TO CAMPUS WITH TRANSFER STUDENTS, STUDENTS WHO COME THROUGH THE GO BLUE GUARANTEE MONEY. MANY OF THOSE STUDENTS ALSO CAN'T AFFORD TO LIVE NEAR CAMPUS, AND AS YOU BUILD HOUSING, I HOPE YOU'LL THINK ABOUT THE IMPLICATIONS TO BRING IN MANY MORE STUDENTS TO THE UNIVERSITY, BUT THOSE WHO OFTEN DON'T HAVE THE FINANCIAL MEANS TO BE HERE, SO I HOPE THAT AS WE HEAR YOUR PLANNING THAT WE'LL HEAR ABOUT THAT AS WELL. BUT, I REALLY DO WANT TO JOIN IN MY COLLEAGUES AND SAY THAT WE APPRECIATE THAT YOU'RE HERE, BUT IF YOU HAVE LAND, LET'S ACTUALLY WORK TOGETHER AND BUILD SOMETHING. I KNOW IT'S HURTING YOUR RECRUITMENT. I HAVE HEARD THAT FROM OTHER UNIVERSITY LEADERSHIP, THAT PEOPLE WANT TO BE ABLE TO LIVE CLOSE TO WHERE THEY WORK, AND YOU'LL GET MORE OF THE LEADERS AND THE BEST IF YOU CAN BUILD SOME HOUSING FOR THEM.
00:34:19.112: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH FOR COMING. THIS WAS VERY HELPFUL TO US ALL AND TO THE COMMUNITY, AND I THINK WITH THE COMMENTS YOU HEAR, I THINK, YOU KNOW, REVEAL THAT OUR FOCUS IS ON HOUSING HERE, DOING WHAT WE CAN ON OUR SIDE, AND THE UNIVERSITY IS A PARTNER THAT IS RESOURCED IN LAND AND WEALTH AND EXPERTISE AND ALSO IN ITS GOAL TO PROVIDE A WORLD-CLASS INSTITUTION OF HIGHER LEARNING, AND THAT REQUIRES A COMMUNITY THAT -- YOU KNOW, THAT WELCOMES EVERYONE, AND WE ARE FACING AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES THAT KNOCK UP AGAINST THAT, AND ANYTHING YOU CAN DO TO HELP IS WHAT WE ARE LOOKING TO WORK WITH YOU ON. SO, THANK YOU.
00:35:08.428: >> THANK YOU.
00:35:10.964: >> I WOULD LIKE TO THANK EVERYONE FOR YOUR TIME, BUT SPECIAL THANKS TO COLETTE, BECAUSE WITH THE TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES THAT WE HAD BEFORE THE MEETING, WE WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO IT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME.
00:35:24.444: >> THANK YOU, AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO GETTING ANY LIST OF TOPICS THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO CHAT WITH US WHEN WE COME MEET AGAIN.
00:35:33.353: >> THANK YOU. THAT IS APPRECIATED. WE NOW COME TO PUBLIC COMMENT RESERVE TIME. IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO SPEAK TO MEMBERS OF COUNCIL AND THE COMMUNITY ABOUT MATTERS OF MUNICIPAL INTEREST. TO SPEAK, ONE NEEDS TO HAVE SIGNED UP IN ADVANCE BY CONTACTING OUR CITY CLERK. SPEAKERS HAVE THREE MINUTES IN WHICH TO SPEAK, SO, PLEASE, PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE TIME CLOCK. AS A MATTER OF COURTESY, WE MAY HAVE ONLY ONE PERSON SPEAKING AT A TIME. AND FINALLY, IF YOU REQUIRE ASSISTANCE IN SPEAKING BEFORE COUNCIL TODAY, WE'D BE DELIGHTED TO PROVIDE IT TO YOU. OUR FIRST SPEAKER IS JAMES DEMORE.
00:36:14.828: >> GOOD EVENING, MAYOR TAYLOR, AND MEMBERS OF COUNCIL. MY NAME IS JAMES DEMORE. MY ADDRESS OF RECORD IS 2771 MAPLEWOOD AVENUE, AND I'M HERE TONIGHT TO SPEAK TO OPPOSE THE REZONING OF THE WEBBER PROPERTY AS BEFORE YOU UNDER AGENDA ITEM C1. FOLKS, I GUESS I HAVE A LOT OF CONCERNS BEING FAMILIAR WITH THIS, BOTH AS A NEIGHBOR AND BEING FAMILIAR WITH PLANNING ISSUES OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, AND, YOU KNOW, I GUESS I JUST WANT TO ASK THIS QUESTION, BECAUSE THIS PROJECT WENT THROUGH THE SYSTEM LAST YEAR AND WAS FORCEFULLY DENIED BY BOTH THE PLANNING COMMISSION AND COUNCIL, AND NOW IT'S BACK BEFORE US. WHAT'S GOING ON HERE? IS THIS A BLACKMAIL? LET'S PASS SOMETHING REASONABLY AWFUL INSTEAD OF SOMETHING TOTALLY CATACLYSMIC TO AVOID A LAWSUIT? I NEED TO ASK SERIOUSLY, WHO IS IN CHARGE HERE? IS IT THE COUNCIL OR THE CITY ATTORNEY? DOES COUNCIL'S VOICE, EVEN ONE LAST YEAR THAT HAD A DECIDEDLY DIFFERENT PHILOSOPHY IN TERMS OF DEVELOPMENT ISSUES, ONE THAT SAYS ON THE BASIS OF NATURAL FEATURES WE SAY NO, DO OUR ORDINANCES NO LONGER MATTER? THIS PROJECT DOES NOT PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THIS PROJECT DOES NOT PROVIDE ANYTHING ENERGY POSITIVE IN AN ERA WHEN WE ARE STARTING TO SERIOUSLY DISCUSS THE ISSUE OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS, AND THIS CITY IS COMING TO GRIPS WITH IT. AND FINALLY, THERE IS NO PUBLIC BENEFIT FOR THE LOSS OF TREES. OKAY, WE MAY GET A FEW MORE BACK THAN WHAT WAS BEING PROPOSED, WHERE PETERS BUILDING CAN JUST WIPE THE WHOLE THING OUT. THAT'S A FORM OF BLACKMAIL, IF I DIDN'T KNOW BETTER. BUT PLANNING STAFF WAS ASKED TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING DIFFERENT, AND IT HAD TO MAKE A JUDGMENT CALL. GOSH, MAYBE WE SHOULD APPROVE THIS, OTHERWISE IT COULD BE WORSE. THAT SHOULD BE THE ROLE OF POLICY MAKERS, NOT THE UNELECTED STAFF. YES, WE RELY ON STAFF TO PROVIDE THEIR EXPERTISE. WE RELY ON THEM FOR THEIR PROFESSIONAL ADVICE, AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WON'T BE BEFORE YOU ANYTIME SOON, BUT AS YOU ARE LOOKING AT REZONING ISSUES, YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE WHOLE MASTER PLAN, IT IS TIME FOR YOU TO REVIEW THE WHOLE ORDINANCE OF HAVING STAFF PROVIDE A RECOMMENDATION, SPECIFICALLY ON A JUDGMENT CALL SUCH AS A P.U.D. I URGE A NO VOTE TONIGHT ON C1. LET'S NOT HAVE THIS GO ANY FURTHER. THIS CITY NEEDS TO STICK TO ITS GUNS. I WANT TO DISCUSS THE ISSUE OF THE HISTORIC PROPERTY ON THE SITE AND THE RICH HISTORY OF THAT. WE HAVE ENOUGH TO GO ON RIGHT HERE IN TERMS OF THE ISSUES OF NATURAL FEATURES. PLEASE LISTEN TO THE NEIGHBORS OF THIS AREA, AND PLEASE VOTE NO. I KNOW YOU'RE UNDER ISSUES REGARDING HOUSING. WE NEED TO DO IT RIGHT. THANKS FOR CONSIDERING MY COMMENTS, MR. MAYOR AND COUNCIL.
00:39:19.345: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS ABDULLAH --
00:39:28.087: >> GOOD EVENING. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK MAYOR TAYLOR AND CITY COUNCIL FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY. I AM HERE ON BEHALF OF THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY ASSOCIATION OF ANN ARBOR. AS YOU MUST KNOW, WE ARE CONVENIENTLY LOCATED ON NORTH CAMPUS OFF PLYMOUTH ROAD. NOW, SEVERAL MONTHS AGO, CITY COUNCIL DECIDED THAT THEY ARE GOING TO ALLOW ON-STREET PARKING ON TRAVERWOOD DRIVE, WHICH CONVENIENTLY WOULD HELP US AND PARTICULARLY ON OUR DAYS OF RELIGIOUS WORSHIP, SUCH AS FRIDAY, IN WHICH WE HAVE A GOOD CHUNK OF THE COMMUNITY COME DURING THE DAY WHERE STUDENTS HAVE CLASSES AND THE EMPLOYEES ARE WORKING. IT'S IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY, AND WE HAVE OUR SERMON, AND PARKING HAS ALWAYS BEEN AN ISSUE FOR US. NOW, WITH THE ADDITION OF ON-STREET PARKING ON TRAVERWOOD DRIVE, IT WOULD HAVE ASSISTED US IN TACKLING THIS DILEMMA THAT WE ARE CONSTANTLY FACING. ONCE OUR COMMUNITY FOUND OUT THAT THE CITY COUNCIL HAS PASSED THE APPROVAL FOR ON-STREET PARKING ON TRAVERWOOD DRIVE, WE GOT TOGETHER FUNDS, ABOUT $40,000, AND WE INSTALLED A NEW EXIT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF OUR PARKING LOT TOWARDS TRAVERWOOD DRIVE IN ORDER TO ASSIST AND MAKE IT A MORE FLUID MOTION. THE WAY THAT WE SOLD THAT TO OUR COMMUNITY WAS THAT THE CITY COUNCIL HAS APPROVED THE ON-STREET PARKING ON TRAVERWOOD DRIVE. NOW, THE REASON I'M HERE IS TO ASK CITY COUNCIL AND MR. MAYOR TO REVERT BACK TO THE ORIGINAL DECISION OF ALLOWING ON-STREET PARKING ON TRAVERWOOD DRIVE. THANK YOU.
00:41:19.132: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU. [ APPLAUSE ] OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS CHRISTINE --
00:41:30.176: >> GOOD EVENING, COUNCIL. I HAVE BEEN HERE SINCE 1986, ATTENDING THE ISLAMIC CENTER AND WORKING AT MICHIGAN ISLAMIC ACADEMY, AND THIS IS MY THIRD TIME HERE TO SPEAK ABOUT PARKING AND TRAFFIC FLOW. I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY MANY OF YOU, EVEN WHO ARE COUNCILMEMBERS, YOU WEREN'T HERE IN 1986. PLYMOUTH ROAD WAS A LITTLE TWO-LANE ROAD WITH HARDLY ANY SHOULDER, AND AN OLD FARM HAD JUST BEEN SOLD OFF AND PLACES WERE DEVELOPING, THE ISLAMIC CENTER BEING ONE OF THOSE, AND I WOULD LIKE TO RECOGNIZE THE IMPROVEMENTS THAT THE CITY HAS MADE. I'M NOT GOING TO GO THROUGH THE LIST, BUT YOU ALL KNOW WHAT PLYMOUTH ROAD LOOKS LIKE NOW, AND IT'S WONDERFUL. IT'S BEEN A GROWING PROCESS FOR US ALL, AND DURING THAT TIME, WE HAVE COOPERATED TOGETHER. WE HAVE BUILT SOME TRUST, AND WE FEEL THAT IT'S NOT JUST GOOD FOR ALL OF ANN ARBOR. IT IS GOOD FOR OUR ISLAMIC CENTER, TOO, THE IMPROVEMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE. I WOULD LIKE TO ALSO POINT OUT TO YOU, BECAUSE PERHAPS YOU DON'T KNOW HOW THE M.C.A. THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY ASSOCIATION HAS WORKED FROM OUR END TO TRY TO IMPROVE THE PARKING. WE HAVE CONSTANTLY BEEN READJUSTING OUR PARKING SITUATION, ESPECIALLY AFTER WE HAD EXPANSIONS. WE'D GO BACK. WE'D TRY TO CORRECT AS MUCH AS WE HAD ROOM FOR THE PARKING. WE HAVE PERSONNEL WHO HELPED TO DIRECT THE PARKING. WE ACTUALLY PAY A FEE MONTHLY TO WILLOW TREE TREE SO THAT WE CAN USE VISITOR PARKING DURING OUR FRIDAY CONGREGATIONAL PRAYER TIMES. WE ARE PUSHING UP AGAINST OUR LIMIT. THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY. AND THEN OUR MOST RECENT IMPROVEMENT, WHICH THE IMAM REFERRED TO, WAS TO OPEN THE TIMED GATE AND THE EGRESS IN BACK WHICH TAKES US OUT TO TRAVERWOOD. WE WERE SO EXCITED. WE HAVE ONE-WAY TRAFFIC FLOW GOING THROUGH THE ISLAMIC CENTER AREA AND TAKING US BACK OUT AGAIN. THE REDUCTION OF CONGESTION ON PLYMOUTH ROAD IS WONDERFUL. IT'S NOT JUST FOR US. IT'S WONDERFUL FOR THE CITY, AND WE WERE, AS HE SAID, COUNTING THEN ON HAVING ON-STREET PARKING. THE THING ABOUT THE ON-STREET PARKING IS THAT IT IS NOT JUST THAT WE ARE GROWING AND WE ARE CONTINUING TO GROW. I HEAR PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT LOOKING TOWARDS THE FUTURE. THAT IS TRUE, BUT ALSO BECAUSE WE WERE TOLD THAT THIS WAS GOING TO COME AND WE WERE COUNTING ON IT, IT'S A PART OF THAT COOPERATION AND TRUST ISSUE. WE WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE YOU GO BACK TO THE PREVIOUS DECISION TO PROVIDE FOR ON-STREET PARKING. I AM SURE THAT YOU CAN FIND CREATIVE WAYS TO MAKE THAT WORK ON TRAVERWOOD, AND THAT IS WHAT WE ARE REQUESTING, BECAUSE WE FEEL THAT THAT'S BEST FOR ALL OF ANN ARBOR, NOT JUST FOR US, JUST AS IT WOULD BE DONE FOR ANY OTHER PLACE OF WORSHIP. PLEASE CONSIDER THE NEEDS OF THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU.
00:44:32.258: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS --
00:44:40.733: >> GOOD EVENING, EVERYBODY. ALL PRAISE DUE TO ALLAH, AND I GIVE THANKS AND PRAISE TO MOHAMMED, THE PROPHET MOHAMMED. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING US TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY. AS MY COLLEAGUE THE IMAM AND SISTER SPOKE ABOUT THE PARKING ISSUE THAT WE HAVE, I HAVE BEEN HERE SINCE 1988. I MOVED HERE AS A LITTLE BOY. I HAVE BEEN A PART OF THIS COMMUNITY FOR A VERY LONG TIME. I MOVED OVERSEAS AND CAME BACK. I HAVE SEEN THIS COMMUNITY GROW A LOT. SOME OF YOU HAVE BEEN HERE LONGER THAN I HAVE, BUT FOR ME, THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF GROWTH. WE HAD ONE CONGREGATION FOR THE FRIDAY PRAYER, AND BECAUSE THE COMMUNITY HAS GROWN SO MUCH AND WE HAVE SO MANY ATTENDEES, WE WERE FORCED TO MAKE IT TWO PRAYERS, TO ACCOMMODATE FOR EVERYBODY TO BE ABLE TO COME AND TO BE ABLE TO HAVE PARKING. HOWEVER, WE STILL HAVE ISSUES WITH PARKING. AS MENTIONED, WE PARK IN THE NEIGHBORING NEIGHBORHOOD. WE PARK IN THE BACK. WE HAVE MADE A GATE IN ORDER FOR CARS TO BE ABLE TO MOVE OUT SMOOTHLY, SO WE WON'T DISTURB THE TRAFFIC COMING OUT, BECAUSE WE ARE COMING OUT OF TRAVERWOOD, WHERE THERE IS A TRAFFIC LIGHT, SO WE ARE NOT DISTURBING THE TRAFFIC COMING BACK AND FORTH. BUT WE ARE STILL HAVING ISSUES WITH PARKING, SO AS MENTIONED, WE ARE -- WE WERE COUNTING ON HAVING PARKING ON THE STREET SO THAT IT WOULD MAKE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO COME IN AND OUT, AND WE WON'T DISTURB THE TRAFFIC IN THE MEANTIME. SO, TO CONTINUE WITH THE RESOLUTION OR THE DECISION THAT WAS MADE PRIOR FOR US TO HAVE PARKING ON THE STREET, IN A MANNER THAT IS -- THAT HAS LONGEVITY OR THAT IS SUSTAINABLE, AS OPPOSED TO A QUICK FIX OR PUTTING A BAND-AID ON IT, WE WANT TO HAVE SOMETHING LIKE, AS WE SAID, PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE, NOT FOR JUST SOMETHING TO GET IT FIXED NOW AND KEEP -- FOR A LITTLE BIT AND THEN THERE'S A PROBLEM. WE WANT SOMETHING THAT IS SUSTAINABLE, BECAUSE WE ARE GROWING, AND WE ARE A PART OF THIS COMMUNITY. WE ARE TRYING TO COLLABORATE AND WORK TOGETHER, SO, PLEASE, YOU KNOW, AS MENTIONED, TRY TO FIND SOME CREATIVE WAYS SO THAT WE CAN HAVE SOMETHING WITH LONGEVITY, SOMETHING THAT'S SUSTAINABLE FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
00:47:13.252: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU. [ APPLAUSE ] OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS ERICA BRIGGS.
00:47:21.994: >> HI. MY NAME IS ERICA BRIGGS. I'M SPEAKING AS A BOARD MEMBER ON BEHALF OF THE WASHTENAW BIKING AND WALKING COALITION, PRIMARILY ON GREEN ROAD, BUT JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON THE COMMENTS BEFORE ME, YOU'LL RECALL THAT WE WERE FULLY IN SUPPORT OF THE PREVIOUS PROJECT IN FRONT OF YOU, WHICH HAD PARKING ON ONE SIDE AND BIKE LANES ON THE OTHER. WE UNDERSTOOD THAT STAFF HAD INCORPORATED AND PUT FORWARD A GOOD PLAN THAT BALANCED THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY, SO WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THAT PREVIOUS PLAN AS WELL. SO, THE REASON I'M BACK BEFORE YOU TONIGHT IS, OBVIOUSLY, WE ARE LOOKING AT GREEN ROAD. IT HAS SOME MODIFICATIONS TO IT IT THIS EVENING. THOSE MODIFICATIONS STAFF ARE PROPOSING INCORPORATE PUBLIC INPUT. THE MODIFICATIONS ARE RESPONSIVE TO NEIGHBORHOOD CONCERNS ABOUT THE CORRIDOR AND ADD BACK IN TURN LANES AT COMMONWEALTH AND BURBANK. WHILE WE LIKED THE FIRST PROJECT BETTER, WE STILL SUPPORT THIS PROJECT BECAUSE IT ACCOMPLISHES THE MAIN OBJECTIVES. NAMELY, IT CALMS TRAFFIC AND REDUCES DANGEROUS DRIVING SPEEDS, WHICH IS FUNDAMENTALLY WHAT THESE PROJECTS ARE ABOUT. FURTHER, IT ELIMINATES A CRITICAL GAP IN OUR BIKE LANE INFRASTRUCTURE, SO WE HAVE BIKE LANES NORTH, WE HAVE BIKE LANES SOUTH. THIS HAS LONG BEEN ON OUR NON -- PLAN. IT'S IMPORTANT. THERE ARE MANY CONCERNS ABOUT THE COSTS FROM THIS PROJECT FROM THOSE WHO OPPOSED IT. THERE ARE NO COSTS IN TERMS OF PUTTING IN THE NEW LINES. AND SO, FINALLY, IT IMPROVES DRIVER SAFETY. YOU HAVE SEEN THE BEFORE AND AFTER CRASH DATA, AND ON GREEN ROAD, JUST ON THE OTHER SIDE OF PLYMOUTH, AND THAT IS BENEFICIAL. BUT WITH MY LIMITED TIME LEFT, I WANTED TO SPEAK TO A LARGER ISSUE AT HAND, WHICH SEEMS TO BE SKEPTICISM ABOUT STAFF AND ACCEPTING THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS, AND SO I WANTED TO DISCUSS WHY IT IS THAT WE SUPPORT THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS, AND IT MIGHT NOT BE QUITE WHAT YOU THINK. WBWC HAS BEEN ADVOCATING FOR IMPROVED BICYCLE LANES AND WALKING FOR CLOSE TO 20 YEARS IN THIS COMMUNITY, AND THAT MEANS THAT WE HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF EXPERIENCE IN WORKING WITH THE CITY TRAFFIC ENGINEERS AND PLANNERS, AND WHILE I HAVE FOUND STAFF TO BE OPEN IN DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE PROCESSES AND STANDARDS THEY USE, WE HAVE OFTEN BEEN AT ODDS WITH THEIR DECISIONS AND SAT THROUGH A NUMBER OF FRUSTRATING MEETINGS WITH ENGINEERING STAFF, BEING TOLD WHY WE CAN'T NARROW THE ROADWAY. OUR ENGINEERS ARE NOT THE RADICAL ANTICAR FOLKS THAT YOU SEEM TO THINK THEY ARE. BY TRAINING, THEY ARE CONSERVATIVE IN NATURE. LAST I CHECKED, THE STANDARDS THEY ARE USING ARE MORE CONSERVATIVE THAN MANY OTHER PLACES IN THE COUNTRY, SUCH AS PORTLAND OR SEATTLE. SO WHEN THEY SAY THAT ROAD DIETS WILL WORK, I BELIEVE THEM, NOT BECAUSE I UNEQUIVOCALLY TRUST EVERY ASPECT THAT THEY SAY, BUT BECAUSE THEY UNDERSTAND THE QUESTIONS AND WHAT THE TOP PRIORITIES ARE, WHICH ARE ESSENTIALLY MOVING CARS THROUGH THE COMMUNITY. THAT'S WHY WE ARE HERE TO PUSH THE ENVELOPE A LITTLE BIT FURTHER. BUT I DON'T THINK YOU NEED TO ARGUE WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THIS CASE. THANK YOU.
00:50:29.081: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS MARY GARTEN.
00:50:35.287: >> HELLO, EVERYONE. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE, OR FOR MAKING ME -- MAKING IT AVAILABLE FOR ME TO SPEAK. I AM IN WARD 2 AT 3080 CEDAR BROOK ROAD. I BIKE AND DRIVE ON GREEN ROAD, WHICH MAKES ME PRETTY OBJECTIVE ABOUT THIS. GREEN DOESN'T NEED SO MANY LANES. WHAT IT NEEDS IS A SAFE WAY FOR CYCLISTS TO TRAVEL. THERE IS A SIDEWALK NEXT TO THE ROAD, BUT THIS IS HEAVILY USED BY PEDESTRIANS AND DOG WALKERS. A CYCLIST WANTS TO TRAVEL BETWEEN ABOUT 9-25 MILES AN HOUR. PEOPLE OUT WALKING THEIR DOGS AND TALKING WITH THEIR FRIENDS COMPLAIN IF WE ARE ON THE SIDEWALK PASSING THEM ALL THE TIME, AND FOR US, IT'S A PAIN TOO. WE ARE CRUISING AT THE SPEED THAT WE WANT TO TRAVEL, THAT WE NEED TO TRAVEL, AND THEN WE HAVE TO BRAKE ALL THE WAY DOWN SO AS TO PASS SAFELY AND WITHOUT STARTLING PEOPLE OR RISK RUNNING THEM OVER. THIS CONSTANT ACCELERATION AND BRAKING ALL THE WAY DOWN TO PASS IS NO WAY TO COMMUTE. IT'S MISERABLE AND INEFFICIENT FOR CYCLISTS, AND PEDESTRIANS DON'T LIKE IT. AND BY THE WAY, THAT ROUTE HAS STRETCHES WITH ZERO MARGINS ON EITHER SIDE. THERE'S A CURB ON ONE SIDE AND A WALL ON THE OTHER. THIS MAKES PASSING BETWEEN PEDESTRIANS AND CYCLISTS VERY DIFFICULT. THE CYCLISTS CAN RIDE IN THE STREET, BUT WITHOUT A BIKE LANE, IT'S NOT THAT SAFE. A MONTH AGO, I WAS BIKING ON NIXON, IN THE BIKE LANE, GOING ABOUT 17 MILES AN HOUR, SO WAY TOO FAST FOR A SIDEWALK, AND IT WAS A BIKE LANE. A WOMAN PULLED UP TO ME AND STARTED SCREAMING AT ME. SHE DID NOT SENSOR HERSELF THE WAY I'M GOING TO, AND MY APOLOGIES FOR ANYTHING THAT COMES OUT. YOU'RE AN IDIOT TO BE IN THE STREET. GET ON THE SIDEWALK. I TRIED TO SLOW DOWN AND DOWN, BUT SHE SLOWED DOWN AND DOWN, AND WHEN I TRIED TO SPEAK, SHE SCREAMED OBSCENITIES AT ME AND THEN BLASTED HER HORN TO DROWN ME OUT. SHE WOULD STOP HONKING ONLY TO SCREAM MORE OBSCENITIES AND THEN IMMEDIATELY BEEPED HER HORN. AT THE RED LIGHT, SHE BLASTED HER HORN THE ENTIRE LIGHT. WE TURNED RIGHT IN THE BIKE LANE, WHEN IT TURNED GREEN, SHE SPED PAST US ALL THE WAY OVER TO THE CURB AND BLOCKED US. AFTER ENOUGH WAITING, SHE MADE A POINT AND DROVE ON. SHE NEVER HAD TO SLOW DOWN TO PASS ME OR, HEAVEN FORBID, MOVE A LITTLE TO THE LEFT TO MAKE WAY FOR A CYCLIST IN HER LANE. RIGHT, HER LANE, SHE THINKS IT IS. I'M NOT SURE SHE WOULD HAVE MOVED OVER TO ACCOMMODATE US EVEN IF WE ACTUALLY HAD BEEN IN HER LANE. SO, SHE WAS ABLE TO STAY IN HER LANE, AND THERE WAS NO CONTACT. WITHOUT A BIKE LANE, THE AGGRESSION WOULD HAVE BEEN WORSE, I AM SURE. MY HUSBAND BIKES ON THE FAR RIGHT OF ROADS WITH AND WITHOUT BIKE LANES. HE BIKES TO WORK A LOT. HE SAYS HE GETS FLIPPED OFF OR YELLED AT ABOUT EVERY FIVE RIDES AS CARS ZOOM PAST HIM, OBVIOUSLY TICKED OFF THAT THEY HAD TO SLOW DOWN OR MOVE OVER FOR A CYCLIST GOING AT CYCLE SPEED. WE NEED A SPACE THAT IS FOR BICYCLES SO DRIVERS DON'T GET MAD THAT WE ARE STEALING THEIR LANES. THIS IS A MATTER OF SAFETY.
00:53:42.207: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS BLAINE COLEMAN.
00:53:52.951: >> AS YOU MAY KNOW, ISRAEL SHOT ABOUT 40 SOME PALESTINIANS OVER THE WEEKEND WHILE YOU WERE ENJOYING YOUR HOLIDAY, SHOT THEM DOWN WITH LIVE BULLETS, AND ISRAEL SHOT MORE WITH RUBBER COATED STEEL BULLETS JUST THIS WEEKEND. IF YOU CARE, THIS WEEKEND, ISRAEL BOMBED IRAQ, IF YOU CARE ABOUT THE LIVES OF IRAQIS. THIS WEEKEND, ISRAEL BOMBED SYRIA, IF YOU CARE ABOUT THE LIVES OF SYRIANS. THIS WEEKEND, ISRAEL BOMBED LEBANON, IF YOU CARE ABOUT THE LIVES OF LEBANESE, AND FOR 17 YEARS, WE HAVE BEEN DEMANDING A RESOLUTION AGAINST ISRAEL TO OFFER SOME PROTECTION TO THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE, TO OFFER SOME PROTECTION TO THE PEOPLE OF THE ARAB WORLD WHO ARE CONSTANTLY TREMBLING UNDER ISRAELI AERIAL BOMBARDMENT. A SIMPLE RESOLUTION LIKE THIS. WE ARE AGAINST MILITARY AID TO ISRAEL. THAT'S NOT HARD FOR YOU TO SAY. IF YOU CARE ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS, AS YOU PRETEND TO DO, AS YOU PRETEND TO DO WHEN YOU PASS HUMAN RIGHTS RESOLUTIONS AGAINST WENDY'S, BECAUSE YOU PRETEND TO CARE ABOUT THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF AMERICAN AND MEXICAN FARM WORKERS, AS YOU PASS HUMAN RIGHTS RESOLUTIONS AGAINST BURMA BECAUSE YOU PRETEND TO CARE ABOUT BURMESE HUMAN RIGHTS, AS YOU PASS RESOLUTIONS AGAINST APARTHEID SOUTH AFRICA, BECAUSE YOU PRETEND TO CARE ABOUT SOUTH AFRICANS RIGHTS. YOU CAN DAMN WELL PASS A RESOLUTION AGAINST ISRAEL, BECAUSE THEY KEEP BOMBING PALESTINIANS WITH YOUR MONEY. YOU CAN DAMN WELL PASS A RESOLUTION AGAINST ISRAEL, BECAUSE THEY KEEP BOMBING IRAQIS AND SYRIANS AND LEBANESE AND WHOEVER ELSE IT PLEASES THEM TO BOMB, WITH TOTAL IMPUNITY, FROM THE WHITE HOUSE DOWN TO THE OUTHOUSE, NOBODY SAYS NO TO ISRAEL WHEN THEY MASSACRE PALESTINIANS. FROM THE WHITE HOUSE DOWN TO THE OUTHOUSE, ISRAEL IS SHOWERED WITH MILITARY AID, BEFORE, DURING, AND AFTER EVERY BOMBARDMENT OF THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE, AND YOU CAN DAMN WELL SAY NO. SOMEBODY HAS TO SAY NO TO ISRAEL. THIS RESOLUTION, THIS SEVEN-WORD RESOLUTION SAYS NO TO ISRAEL, NO. AND YOU CAN DAMN WELL PASS IT. IT'S NOT THAT HARD, IF YOU CARE ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS AS YOU PRETEND TO DO. DO YOU CARE ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS? MAYOR TAYLOR HAS RESPONDED BY SAYING HE DOESN'T THINK WHAT'S HAPPENING IN GAZA IS A MATTER FOR THE CITY TO ADDRESS. MAYOR TAYLOR HAS GIVEN HIS REASON AS, QUOTE, "OUR PRIMARY FOCUS IS TO ENGAGE ISSUES THAT IMPACT MEMBERS OF THE ANN ARBOR COMMUNITY." PALESTINIANS ARE MEMBERS OF THE ANN ARBOR COMMUNITY.
00:56:55.968: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS --
00:57:04.009: >> THANK YOU. THANK YOU, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU. PALESTINIANS ARE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMUNITY. THEY HAVE BEEN COMING TO CITY COUNCIL. THEY HAVE BEEN ASKING FOR BOYCOTT OF ISRAEL FOR A VERY LONG TIME. THIS MAYOR TAYLOR HAS BEEN SITTING IN VARIOUS CHAIRS WHILE WE HAVE COME HERE WITH STUDENTS, CHANTING DIVEST, BOYCOTT ISRAEL. MANY, MANY PEOPLE HAVE DIED WHILE MEMBERS OF THIS CITY COUNCIL HAVE SAT AND WATCHED THEIR DEMISE. ISRAEL IS A MENACE TO THE ENTIRE WORLD, SPECIFICALLY TO PEOPLE OF THE MIDDLE EAST. THEY BOMB WHO THEY LIKE. THEY SHOOT WHO THEY LIKE. THEY EVICT WHO THEY LIKE. THEY DESTROY THE ENVIRONMENT. THEY UPROOT TREES. THEY DO WHAT THEY LIKE. AND GUESS WITH WHOSE BLESSING AND WITH WHOSE MONEY? WITH YOUR BLESSING AND WITH YOUR MONEY. EVERY ISRAELI HAS WHAT NO AMERICAN HAS, WHICH IS FULL HEALTH CARE, WHILE IN AMERICA 7 MILLION PEOPLE WHO ARE ON INSULIN HAVE TO DRAG THEIR RATIONS SO THEY WILL MAKE IT. A QUARTER OF THEM DON'T HAVE ENOUGH INSULIN. ISRAELIS ENJOY A FULL BENEFIT OF MEDICAL CARE, COURTESY OF AMERICAN TAXPAYERS. IN THE UNITED STATES, THERE ARE STUDENTS WHO CANNOT GO TO COLLEGE BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD IT. I'M SORRY. BUT, IN ISRAEL, THEY CAN. IT'S FREE. EDUCATION IS FREE FOR ISRAELI WHO'S GOT A GUN AND SHOOTS EVERY ARAB, EVERY ISRAELI, EVERY ARAB IN IRAQ, IN SYRIA, IN LEBANON, IN GAZA. THEY ARE MURDERERS. DON'T GIVE THEM MONEY. THE VERY LEAST YOU CAN DO IS TO CUT OFF THEIR MILITARY AID. THE VERY LEAST YOU CAN DO IS SAY NO MORE MURDERING OF PALESTINIANS IN DAYLIGHT. THAT IS THE VERY LEAST YOU CAN DO. YOU HAVE SO MANY PROBLEMS FUNDING THIS AND FUNDING THAT. ISRAEL IS GOING TO BE GETTING $38 BILLION IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS. THAT IS BILLIONS. THAT 38 BILLION CAN STAY HERE AND HELP YOU OUT WITH A LOT OF STUFF THAT YOU DON'T HAVE MONEY FOR. IF YOU HAVE NO HEART, IF YOU HAVE NO HUMANITY, IF ALL THAT IS HAPPENING, THE TORTURE THAT YOU ARE INFLICTING ON PALESTINIAN PEOPLE DOES NOT PHASE YOU AS A HUMAN BEING, THINK ABOUT YOUR OWN POCKETS. 38 BILLION IS NOTHING TO SPIT AT. IT'S A LOT OF MONEY. KEEP IT HERE. 38 BILLION, YOU GUYS. WHAT'S HAPPENING TO PALESTINIANS IS SHEER TORTURE. THE HOSPITALS HAVE NO EQUIPMENT. THOSE WHO ONLY GET SHOT ONLY GET SHOT END UP DYING FROM ALL KINDS OF INFECTIONS. CUT OFF THEIR MILITARY AID.
01:00:12.330: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU.
01:00:13.431: >> THAT'S THE LEAST YOU CAN DO.
01:00:16.935: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS ALAN HABER.
01:00:30.916: >> HELLO, COUNCIL. I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU IN A WHILE. I HAVE BEEN ACROSS THE GREAT WATER, BACK IN A LAND WHERE THERE IS NOT A POTHOLE IN THE ROAD, TOTALLY AMAZING, MOUNTAIN ROADS, ICY ROADS, AND THE COMMONS IN EVERY COMMUNITY, NO PROBLEM. I AM MOVED BY THE PREVIOUS COMMENTS. I DID DO A CALCULATION THAT EVERY PERSON IN ANN ARBOR, DOWN TO THE LITTLE BABIES, IF YOU LOOK AT THE POPULATION AND YOU LOOK AT WHAT GOES TO ISRAEL IN MILITARY AID, $22 FOR EVERY PERSON IN ANN ARBOR EVERY YEAR. IS THAT WELL PROPORTIONED FUNDS? BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. I WROTE TO YOU, MR. MAYOR AND THE COUNCIL, MAYBE FIVE TIMES IN THE LAST MONTH SINCE THE CONFERENCE OF U.S. MAYORS PUT OUT A RESOLUTION FOR THE ABOLITION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS, FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE U.N. APPROVED TREATY FOR THE PROHIBITION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS AS INHUMANE, AND NOT EVEN TO BE POSSESSED TO THREATEN WITH AND ENCOURAGING LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO INTERROGATE CANDIDATES FOR NATIONAL OFFICE, PARTICULARLY THOSE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, WHETHER THEY WOULD SUPPORT THE TREATY TO PROHIBIT NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND RETURN TO A POLICY OR EMBRACE A POLICY OF DIPLOMACY RATHER THAN OF AGGRESSION AND DOMINATION. I WISH YOU WOULD BE PART OF THE CONFERENCE OF MAYORS' UNANIMOUS RESOLUTION AND HAVE ANN ARBOR BE SEEN AS A CITY OF PEACE AND A CITY THAT IS CONCERNED ABOUT THE PRECARIOUS SITUATION OF THE ENTIRE LIFE SYSTEM, IF ANY OF THESE BOMBS GO OFF AND THE CONSEQUENCES ARE BEYOND CALCULATION, PARALLEL TO THE CRISIS OF THE CLIMATE. SO, WHEN ANN ARBOR ON SEPTEMBER 21, THE INTERNATIONAL DAY OF PEACE, SATURDAY, AND SEPTEMBER 22, SUNDAY, THERE IS, AS THERE HAS BEEN FOR THE LAST SIX YEARS, AN ANN ARBOR DOWNTOWN CELEBRATION OF THE INTERNATIONAL DAY OF PEACE, AND WE WISH THAT YOU WOULD PASS A RESOLUTION, MAKE A PROCLAMATION, SOMEHOW RECOGNIZE TO THE PEOPLE OF ANN ARBOR THAT THIS IS A TIME FOR US TO COME TOGETHER WITH SUCH QUESTIONS AS WHAT CAN YOU DO, WHAT WOULD HELP MAKE PEACE IN THE WORLD AND LOCALLY IN OUR OWN COMMUNITY, AND WHO AND WHAT ARE THE POWERS AND PEOPLE BLOCKING THE WAY. THESE ARE QUESTIONS FOR ALL OF US, AND THE CITY COUNCIL IS SILENT ABOUT IT, AND IT IS VERY DISTRESSING, VERY DISTRESSING.
01:03:34.599: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS KATHLEEN HIRAGA.
01:03:48.113: >> GOOD EVENING, COUNCIL AND MR. MAYOR. I APPEARED ABOUT A MONTH AND A HALF AGO REGARDING THE AIRBNB ISSUE THAT WE ARE ALL THINKING ABOUT. I WISH WE WEREN'T THINKING ABOUT IT. I WISH WE WERE ACTING ON IT. I MET WITH DEREK DELACOURT ON THE 5th. WE HAD A NICE MEETING. HE ASKED ME WHAT I THOUGHT I WANTED, WHAT THE CITY COULD POSSIBLY DO. I, AFTER 20 YEARS IN SANTA MONICA, KNEW THAT THERE WAS A LAW THAT WAS PASSED TWO YEARS AGO, THAT IT WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL. BECAUSE I WAS A RESIDENT THERE, I CALLED THE CITY, AND DENISE SMITH, WHO WAS ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO DRAFTED THE ORDINANCE SHARED WITH ME ALL OF THE PROS, ALL OF THE CONS, ALL OF THE PITFALLS, AND SHE SAID COUNCIL WOULD BE WELCOME TO CALL HER, AND THAT SHE WOULD SHARE MORE INFORMATION. THE ORDINANCE IS VERY, VERY CLEAR. IT'S VERY SIMPLE. DEREK FELT THAT IT WAS THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE THING THAT WE COULD POSSIBLY TAKE AS A CASE STUDY. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'M REALLY FRUSTRATED WITH IS THAT THERE IS -- IT FEELS LIKE THERE IS A DISCONNECT BETWEEN THE COUNCIL AND THEN DEREK, BRETT, CITY ATTORNEY AND HOWARD. I AM HOPING THAT WE CAN ALL COME TOGETHER SINCE THIS IS REALLY COMING DOWN THE PIPE. DEREK HAS SAID THAT HE WAS SCHEDULING A THREE-NIGHT MEETING IN OCTOBER FOR THE PUBLIC. HE HAS YET TO PUT A DATE DOWN, AND I AM ASKING THAT PERHAPS YOU COULD SPEAK WITH HIM AND SAY ONE MEETING, HERE, 7:00 P.M., INSTEAD OF DISPARATE MEETINGS, PUBLIC LIBRARIES, AND NOBODY IS GOING TO GO. IN THE MEANTIME, I PUT UP A WEBSITE CALLED LEGISLATE AIRBNB, AND IT IS A PETITION WITH SIGNATURES WITH AREAS FOR COMMENTS AND RESEARCH THAT WE ARE DOING. BECAUSE I PUT THIS UP, I'M GETTING HARASSED. I AM NOT LEGISLATING. I TOLD SOME OF THE OTHER GROUPS, I SAID, I'M NOT THE LIGHTNING ROD. I ALSO GOT SERIOUSLY HARASSED ON NEXT DOOR, AND NEXT DOOR ACTUALLY TOOK THE SITE DOWN, AND IT TOOK ME FIVE HOURS TO PUT THE SITE BACK UP, AND I BLOCKED ALL COMMENTS. SO, I REALLY FEEL LIKE THIS IS A TICKING TIME BOMB, AND I THINK IT'S TIME TO MOVE, AND I THINK EACH ONE OF YOU SHOULD PROBABLY MOVE ON THIS IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD. I CAN'T COVER WOODLAND DRIVE AND THE CITY. SO, PLEASE, PUT FLIERS ONCE WE GET A DATE. TALK TO DEREK, SEE IF WE CAN GET ONE MEETING, AND LET'S GET THIS THING GOING. BECAUSE IT'S REALLY, I CAN TELL YOU FROM FIRSTHAND, AND JACK WAS ACTUALLY KIND ENOUGH TO COME OVER TO MY HOUSE AND OVERVIEW A BUNCH OF GUYS WITH GUN T-SHIRTS AND BUMPER STICKERS WHO WERE STUFFED INTO THE HOUSE NEXT DOOR FOR THREE DAYS, AND I BASICALLY WAS TRAPPED. SO, IT'S NOT JUST A CONCEPTUAL THING. IT'S A REAL THING, SO LET'S GET GOING. OKAY? THANK YOU.
01:06:54.499: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU. ARE THERE COMMUNICATIONS TODAY FROM COUNCIL? COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
01:07:02.907: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD:  I HAVE SPOKEN ABOUT THIS MANY TIMES, AND I WANT TO CLARIFY THAT MY STATEMENT IS NOT CRITICAL OF ANY EXISTING STAFF MEMBER. THE PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE IS THAT WE HAVE A VOID IN OUR STAFFING. WE DO NOT HAVE AN OPERATIONS MANAGER FOR VISION ZERO. VISION ZERO IS TO REDUCE ALL SERIOUS AND FATAL ROADWAY CRASHES. AS A RESULT, WE HAVE SPECIAL INTEREST ENGINEERING. WE HAVE SAUSAGE BEING MADE AT THE COUNCIL TABLE. WE NEED ONE PERSON WHO HAS THE EXPERTISE TO LEAD US SO THAT WE ARE NOT, AS THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER SAID, WE ARE NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT IT, WE ARE DOING IT, AND SOME OF THE REASONS, WE HAVE MADE NO SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON PEDESTRIAN CRASHES, IN SPITE OF SPENDING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. OUR PEDESTRIAN CRASH RATE IS NOT GOING DOWN LIKE OTHER VISION ZERO CITIES. WE HAVE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT OVER OUR VEHICULAR TRAFFIC. PEOPLE ARE OUT THERE, OPTIMIZING OUR TRAFFIC SIGNALS, DOING A LOT OF THINGS TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR VEHICULAR TRAFFIC GOES SMOOTHLY. WE DON'T HAVE THAT FOR OUR PEDESTRIANS. WE ALSO HAVE TO RECONSIDER ROAD RECONSTRUCTION PROJECTS. WE HAVE TO PILOT ROAD RECONSTRUCTION PROJECTS, WITH THE EXPERTISE OF AN OPERATIONS MANAGER, SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS A CHIEF ENGINEER, WITH TRANSPORTATION EXPERTISE, THIS WOULD NOT HAPPEN. AND I JUST WANT TO TAKE A COUPLE OF MINUTES TO EXPLAIN SOME OF THE OPERATIONAL ISSUES THAT I HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH IN THE LAST TWO WEEKS. NUMBER ONE, HURON HIGH SCHOOL, I WAS OUT THERE THIS MORNING. IT WAS AN ABSOLUTE MESS. WE ALLOWED THE SCHOOL TO CHANGE THE TRAFFIC FLOW BECAUSE THEY GAVE US FALSE INFORMATION. I HATE TO SAY THAT, BUT IT IS FALSE. I WAS ON THE SCHOOL BOARD. I WAS ON THE P.T.O. AT HURON. I HAD CHILDREN THERE. THE INFORMATION THEY ARE GIVING US IS FALSE. AN OPERATIONS MANAGER WOULD HAVE ASKED THE RIGHT QUESTIONS AND NOT ACCEPTED THEIR FALSE INFORMATION. NUMBER TWO, VISION ZERO CLAIMS THAT WE SHOULD BE STUDYING SERIOUS CRASH SITES, SO WHAT'S HAPPENED OVER THE WEEKEND? WE HAD TWO FORKLIFTS ON HURON NEAR THAYER, WHICH WAS THE SITE OF A SERIOUS INJURY CRASH IN JANUARY, BLOCKING VISIBILITY. I STOPPED. I ASKED THE CONSTRUCTION WORKERS TO MOVE THE FORKLIFTS, AND THEY DID. BUT THAT'S NOT THE ROLE OF A COUNCILMEMBER, AND IT'S EVEN FUNNIER. AT FULLER, THE SITE OF A PEDESTRIAN CRASH THAT WAS FATAL ALMOST THREE YEARS AGO, SOMEONE PUT A PORTA-JOHN IN THE RIGHT OF WAY BLOCKING VISIBILITY TO THE CROSSWALK. THAT HAS SINCE BEEN MOVED. AGAIN, WE NEED SOMEONE OUT THERE, SORT OF THE EYES AND EARS, PREVENTING THIS. WE WILL NEVER MAKE PROGRESS WITH VISION ZERO IF WE SIMPLY HAVE MEETINGS AND TALK ABOUT IT BUT WON'T HAVE AN OPERATIONS MANAGER. SCHOOL CROSS-WALKS IN FRONT OF THE SCHOOL, THEY ARE DANGEROUS. WE HAD A PROJECT LAST YEAR, IT FAILED, AND SO WE STOPPED AND DID NOTHING. WE NEED TO ADDRESS THAT. WE HAD A NEWSLETTER GO OUT THAT HAD INFORMATION FROM OUR POLICE DEPARTMENT. IT IS EMBARRASSING. IT TALKED ABOUT WHAT TO DO, ALWAYS CROSS IN A MARKED CROSSWALK. WE HAVE UNMARKED CROSSWALKS. ANYONE WITH ANY EXPERTISE IN THAT AREA WOULD KNOW IT. LASTLY, WE NEED A WAY TO TRACK NEAR MISSES AND ROAD RAGE, SUCH AS WE HEARD ABOUT TODAY, AND I HAVE HAD A NUMBER OF THOSE CASES. ONE SUGGESTION WAS THAT WE EXPAND THE A2FIX IT SYSTEM FOR A CATEGORY FOR NEAR MISSES AND ROAD RAGE, SO I WOULD ASK THE ADMINISTRATION IF THEY WOULD CONSIDER THAT. AGAIN, I PLEAD, WE NEED THIS OPERATIONS MANAGER. I'M PREPARED TO BRING A RESOLUTION FORWARD AT THE NEXT COUNCIL MEETING, IF NECESSARY. WE CAN SPEED UP THE HIRING PROCESS. MAYBE WE NEED TO BRING IN A CONTRACTOR WHO IS OVERQUALIFIED, WHO CAN ACTUALLY IDENTIFY THE SCOPE OF THIS POSITION SO IT WILL BE EASIER FOR US TO HIRE THE PERSON, BUT WE HAVE GOT TO TAKE ACTION NOW. THANKS.
01:11:38.149: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
01:11:41.519: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  THANK YOU. I'M JUST LOOKING BACK ON THAT WALL, AND WE HAVE GOT SOME NEW ART HERE, SO, BEING ON THE ARTS COMMISSION, I SHOULD BE POINTING THAT OUT. PLEASE TAKE A LOOK AT THAT AS YOU VISIT US HERE. SECONDLY, I WOULD LIKE TO THANK STAFF FOR THE NEW PAVEMENT ON WEST LIBERTY STREET. THAT WAS A PLEASANT SURPRISE, BETWEEN 7th AND STADIUM. I WASN'T EXPECTING THAT TO BE DONE THIS YEAR, AND THERE IT WAS. SO, I APPRECIATE A SAFE BIKE LANE NOW TO GO EASTBOUND ON LIBERTY, AS WE TALK ABOUT PEDESTRIAN SAFETY AND SAFETY OF CYCLISTS AND EVERYBODY WHO USES THE INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT'S BEEN MY BATTLE CRY, IS BETTER PAVEMENT, AND IT WAS GOOD TO SEE THAT BEING DONE. SO, I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU. AND I WANTED TO ALSO APOLOGIZE TO SOME OF MY CONSTITUENTS. I DID GO OUT OF TOWN. I DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO RESPOND TO SOME EMAILS REGARDING AIRBNBS IN THE ADVERTISED RV CAMPSITE THAT SOMEBODY WAS PROPOSING TO DO ON THE OLD WEST SIDE FOR GAME DAY, TURN THE RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD INTO A RECREATIONAL PARK. FORTUNATELY, THAT DID NOT TRANSPIRE TO THE DEGREE THAT IT WAS FEARED TO HAVE -- BE. SO I APPRECIATE KATHLEEN BEING HERE FOR AT LEAST THE SECOND TIME ADVOCATING FOR BETTER REGULATIONS AND OVERSIGHT, AND MOSTLY ENFORCEMENT, AND I GUESS THAT'S WHERE THE RUBBER HITS THE PAVEMENT, IS ENFORCEMENT ON THESE SHORT-TERM RENTALS. WE HAVE A COMMUNITY WHERE OVER 50% OF THE RESIDENTS ARE RENTERS, SO IT'S NOT VERY EASY TO DO THE TYPE OF ENFORCEMENT THAT PROTECTS THE PROPERTY RIGHTS, TENANTS RIGHTS, CIVIL RIGHTS, AND THE RIGHTS OF OTHERS. WE NEED TO HAVE MORE CONSCIONABLELY SOCIAL BUSINESS PRACTICES BEING DEMONSTRATED. WE JUST DON'T HAVE ENOUGH OF THAT THESE DAYS, AND SO WE NEED TO COME IN WITH BETTER REGULATION, AND WE DO NEED TO GET AHEAD OF IT. IT IS ADDING TO THE CRISIS THAT WE KEEP HEARING ABOUT WITH THE FACT THAT THIS TOWN IS BECOMING LESS AFFORDABLE, AND THIS IS JUST ANOTHER ELEMENT THAT IS CAUSING PRICES TO EVEN GO HIGHER, AS RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE IS LOOKED AT MORE OF AN INVESTMENT IN A CAPITALISTIC TOOL THAN PEOPLE ACTUALLY LIVE IN THEIR COMMUNITY AND FOSTER THE COMMUNITY. LASTLY, I WANT TO INVITE PEOPLE TO MY NEXT CONSTITUENT HOUR, WHICH IS SEPTEMBER 15TH, SUNDAY, FROM 4:00 TO 5:00, PERHAPS LONGER, OVER AT 415 WEST WASHINGTON, WHERE WE'LL DISCUSS THE POSSIBILITIES OF FUTURE DEVELOPMENT AT 415, AMONGST OTHER THINGS. I AM SURE WE'LL HAVE A LOT TO TALK ABOUT, WHETHER IT'S GELMAN, AIRBNB, OR THE DEVELOPMENT, AND ANYTHING ELSE ANYONE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT, SEPTEMBER 15TH AT 4:00 AT 415 WEST WASHINGTON, THE ENTRANCE ON WASHINGTON. THANK YOU.
01:15:12.129: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER COMMUNICATION FROM COUNCIL? COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
01:15:15.166: >> COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER:  I JUST WANT TO SEND OUT AN INVITATION TO EVERYONE IN WARD 1 AND BEYOND THAT WE WILL BE HAVING A MEETING ABOUT THE BARTON DRIVE SIDEWALK PROJECTS ON THURSDAY NIGHT, SEPTEMBER 19TH, FROM 6:30 TO 8:30 AT THE NORTH SIDE S.T.E.A.M. SCHOOL. SO YOU'RE ALL INVITED TO THAT, AND ALSO YOU'RE ENCOURAGED TO EMAIL COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER AND ME WITH YOUR CONCERNS AND QUESTIONS BEFORE AND AFTER THIS SEPTEMBER 19 MEETING. I ALSO WANTED TO THANK WARD 1 RESIDENT CHARLES BOLTMAN. HE BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION THAT LAST YEAR, COUNCIL HAD APPROVED A RESOLUTION TO ASK THE STATE HOUSE AND SENATE TO RESTORE THE STATE'S HISTORIC PRESERVATION TAX CREDITS, BUT THOSE HAD EXPIRED AT THE END OF 2018, SO CITY STAFF HAS REWORKED THOSE, AND COUNCIL WILL BE REVIEWING THOSE AT THE SEPTEMBER 16 MEETING. FOR EVERYONE INTERESTED IN HISTORIC PRESERVATION TAX CREDITS. AND WE HAVE ALSO HAD A LOT OF CONCERN LATELY ABOUT SEMITRUCKS DOWNTOWN, AND UNFORTUNATELY, THE TRUCKS INTERACTING WITH OTHER VEHICLES AND PEDESTRIANS, SO WE HAVE CALLED FOR A STUDY ON THE DATA OF TRENDS RELATED TO THE VOLUME OF TRUCKS OVER CERTAIN LENGTH AND HEIGHT AT DIFFERENT DAYS AND TIMES, AND OUR NEW CHIEF, MICHAEL COX, AND OUR HEAD OF PUBLIC SERVICES IS LOOKING INTO THE ISSUE OF SEMI-TRUCKS ON DOWNTOWN STREETS, SO, STAY TUNED FOR NEW RESTRICTIONS ON THAT, AND THEN LASTLY -- OR NEW IDEAS AND, POSSIBLY, IF THERE'S NEED FOR RESTRICTIONS. AND THEN LASTLY, I WANT TO THANK THE COUPLE DOZEN RESIDENTS AND STAFF MEMBERS WHO HAVE BEEN WORKING HARD THE LAST TEN DAYS OR SO ABOUT THE NEW ROUNDABOUT THAT IS APPROVED TO BE INSTALLED ON BROADWAY OUT IN FRONT OF THE 1140 BROADWAY PROJECT NEAR PLYMOUTH ROAD AND BROADWAY, AND WE HAVE REALLY PUT A LOT OF EFFORT WITH STAFF AND THE ATTORNEY'S OFFICE AND A COUPLE DOZEN RESIDENTS TO TRY AND FIND A CREATIVE SOLUTION INSTEAD OF THE ROUNDABOUT, AND AFTER ANOTHER LONG MEETING TODAY, WE HAVE DECIDED THAT WE HAVE FAILED FINDING A BETTER SOLUTION AT THIS TIME, SO CONSTRUCTION OF THE ROUNDABOUT IS SCHEDULED TO BEGIN THIS FRIDAY, BUT I JUST WANTED TO ASSURE THE RESIDENTS WHO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT IT THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO DISCUSS IT, RECEIVE YOUR FEEDBACK, AND CONSIDER POSSIBLE MODIFICATIONS AS WE GO FORWARD. THANK YOU.
01:18:22.286: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER COMMUNICATION FROM COUNCIL? I HAVE A COUPLE OF COMMUNICATIONS. FIRST, SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED THAT I WAS NOT HERE AT THE LAST MEETING, AND YOU WERE ABLY AND EXPERTLY LED BY MAYOR PRO TEM LUMM. THE REASON FOR MY ABSENCE IS I WAS IN JAPAN. MICHIGAN HAS A SISTER STATE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE SHIGA PREFECTURE AND LAST YEAR HAD THEIR 50th ANNIVERSARY OF THAT RELATIONSHIP. THERE WAS A MOTION PUT ON BY A NUMBER OF MEMBERS OF THAT GROUP, ABOUT 25 OF US OR SO FROM ACROSS THE STATE. A NUMBER OF MAYORS AND RESIDENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- PLEASE, MA'AM. PLEASE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [ GAVEL ] THANK YOU VERY MUCH. A NUMBER OF MAYORS AND MAYOR SHORE FROM LANSING, BY WAY OF EXAMPLE, WENT OVER TO CELEBRATE THE 50th ANNIVERSARY OF THAT RELATIONSHIP, AND IT IS ALSO THE 50th ANNIVERSARY OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN -- AT OUR NEXT COUNCIL MEETING, I MAY TAKE SOME PRIVILEGE AND GIVE YOU TWO OR THREE MINUTES OF PICTURES AND VIDEO ON WHAT THEY WERE ROLLING OUT FOR US. WE ARE GOING TO BE HAVING HERE IN ANN ARBOR AT COBBLESTONE FARMS, I BELIEVE ON THE 21st, I THINK AT 3:00 P.M., ALTHOUGH I'LL CHECK ON THAT. LET ME GET THAT AND I'LL CIRCULATE THAT TO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC AND COUNCIL, A TREE PLANTING IN HONOR OF THE 50th ANNIVERSARY AS WELL, AND SO THAT IS -- THAT'S THE REPORT FROM JAPAN. THE FOLKS THERE WERE MOST EXCELLENT, INCREDIBLY WELCOMING, AND, YOU KNOW, ALL OF ANN ARBOR -- YOU KNOW, ANN ARBOR HAS A FRIEND IN IKONE, AND IT'S NICE KNOWING THERE ARE OTHER FRIENDS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD. I WOULD ALSO LIKE -- LET'S SEE -- WOULD LIKE TO RECOMMEND THE FOLLOWING NOMINATIONS FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION IN OUR NEXT MEETING TO THE RECREATION ADVISORY COMMISSION, MARY CASEY AND STEPHANIE DOOPER, AND I WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT THE FOLLOWING CONSIDERATIONS, TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION, ZACHARY ACKERMAN, TO THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION, DEANNA LERNIHAN.
01:20:48.465: >> COULD I MAKE A REQUEST THAT MC1 BE CONSIDERED AS TWO SEPARATE NOMINATIONS?
01:20:59.943: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  LET'S ROLL WITH THE FIRST, COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION -- DISCUSSION? [ GAVEL ] MA'AM, PLEASE. PLEASE, MA'AM, THANK YOU. THANK YOU, MA'AM. [ GAVEL ] THANK YOU, MA'AM. FURTHER DISCUSSION? SURE. THIS IS WITH RESPECT TO MC1, THE NOMINATION OF ZACHARY ACKERMAN TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION. I BELIEVE IT'S BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED.
01:21:57.935: >> WE GOT INTERRUPTED. I DON'T KNOW WHERE WE ARE AT.
01:22:01.839: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  ALL IN FAVOR? [ CHORUS OF AYES ]
01:22:04.942: >> NO.
01:22:05.943: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  I'M CONFUSED. THERE WAS A MOTION WAS SPLIT, AND THEN WE KIND OF GOT INTERRUPTED.
01:22:10.781: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  IT WAS MOVED AND SECONDED.
01:22:12.950: >> COULD WE REQUEST A ROLL CALL VOTE PLEASE?
01:22:18.021: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  ABSOLUTELY. ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE. AND I FORGOT, WHO IS ON POINT TODAY? COUNCILMEMBER SMITH.
01:22:26.330: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN:  I'M SORRY. THERE IS DISCUSSION IF THERE IS A ROLL CALL VOTE.
01:22:29.967: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  I'M SORRY. LET ME STEP BACK. THIS MOTION HAS BEEN MADE AND HAS BEEN SECONDED. I HAVE ASKED FOR DISCUSSION. THERE WAS CONFUSION. LET ME STEP BACK. IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN AND THEN GRISWOLD.
01:22:43.013: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. BASED ON THE LAST VOICE VOTE, I HAVE WORKED HARD TO REPRESENT THIS COUNCIL IN CONVERSATIONS AT THE PLANNING COMMISSION. I HAVE WORKED HARD TO DO RIGHT BY THE RESIDENTS OF ANN ARBOR. MY WORKLOAD HAS MORE THAN DOUBLED AS A RESULT OF MY SERVICE ON BOTH CITY COUNCIL AND THE PLANNING COMMISSION OVER THE LAST TWO OR THREE YEARS NOW. IF I'M NOT GOING TO BE REAPPOINTED, I WOULD APPRECIATE DISCUSSION AND FEEDBACK AS TO WHY. THANK YOU.
01:23:15.078: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD?
01:23:17.414: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD:  I HAD A QUESTION ABOUT HAVING TWO COUNCILMEMBERS ON THE PLANNING COMMISSION, GIVEN THE IMPORTANCE OF IT, AND I BELIEVE WE WERE TOLD THAT REQUIRED A CHARTER AMENDMENT. COULD I GET CLARIFICATION ON THAT?
01:23:36.466: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING AS WELL, BUT I'LL --
01:23:39.336: >> YEAH.
01:23:39.903: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  -- DEFER.
01:23:43.040: >> I BELIEVE MR. McDONALD HAS RESPONDED AND PROVIDED SOMETHING THAT RELATES TO SPECIFICITY IN THE STATE LAW. I DON'T HAVE ANY FURTHER CLARIFICATION ON THAT FOR YOU.
01:23:49.913: >> OKAY.
01:23:52.983: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD, YOU STILL HAVE THE FLOOR.
01:23:56.386: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD:  MAY I ASK FOR AN EXPLANATION FROM COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
01:23:59.690: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
01:24:02.459: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  SO, BECAUSE I INTERACTED WITH ALL OF YOU AND CITY STAFF BACK IN NOVEMBER, WHEN WE WERE MAKING COUNCIL APPOINTMENTS, THIS INQUIRY WAS MADE ABOUT POTENTIALLY HAVING TWO COUNCILMEMBERS APPOINTED AS LIAISONS TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION, AND CITY ATTORNEY FROST -- AND I CAN GO BACK AND SEARCH AND RESEND THE INFORMATION THAT WAS PROVIDED, AND IT IS -- IT DOES REQUIRE AN AMENDMENT. BUT I WILL PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION, SO -- SO, AS THE RULES STAND TODAY, THERE'S ONE LIAISON.
01:24:44.201: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  I BELIEVE COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:24:46.470: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  THANK YOU. I WILL START OFF WITH A SOMEWHAT AWKWARD CONVERSATION ABOUT OUR COLLEAGUES. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON THIS, AND BECAUSE IT IS GOING TO A ROLL CALL, I DO APPRECIATE COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN'S REQUEST FOR DELIBERATION ON THE MATTER, IN THE VOTE. IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A HANDICAP, SPEAKING FIRST ON THIS, BUT I HAVE HEARD CRIES FOR -- TO HAVE NEW BLOOD ON THIS PLANNING COMMISSION. I HAVE HEARD PLEAS AND REQUESTS FOR A SECOND COUNCILMEMBER TO BE ON IT, WHICH I THINK IS A GOOD IDEA, CONSIDERING THE WORKLOAD AND THE IMPORTANCE AND THE INFLUENCE THAT THE COMMISSION HAS ON OUR COMMUNITY AND THE DISCUSSIONS AND DEBATES THAT SURROUND IT, AS THE COUNCIL CHAMBER IS FULL OF MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY WHEN WE HAVE CONTENTIOUS LAND USE ISSUES TO VOTE ON. BUT I ALSO DO RESPECT MY COLLEAGUES IN THE CAPACITY THEY HAVE TO FULFILL THEIR DUTIES. I'M ON NINE OR TEN DIFFERENT COMMISSIONS AND BOARDS. NONE OF THEM WERE CHALLENGED BY MY COLLEAGUES. THEY ALL GAVE ME THEIR BLESSINGS AND SUPPORT AND TRUST THAT I CAN DO THE WORK ON THOSE BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS AND SERVE THE RESIDENTS OF ANN ARBOR AND THE MEMBERS AT THIS TABLE. I'M TROUBLED BY THE FACT THAT -- AND IT'S FINE, EVERYONE HAS THE RIGHT TO THEIR VOTE, AND THAT'S WHY WE TAKE VOTES, BUT IT'S A LITTLE CONCERNING THAT THAT SHARED COLLEGIATE RELATIONSHIP ISN'T UNANIMOUS AT THE TABLE. AND I RESPECT THE PROCEDURE IN THE CITY CHARTER THAT ALLOWS THE MAYOR TO PUT FORTH A NOMINATION IN COUNCIL TO VOTE ON IT, AND THAT'S WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO, AND BASED ON THE TREATMENT THAT I HAVE RECEIVED FROM MY COLLEAGUE, I WILL BE SUPPORTING HIM TONIGHT, AND I KNOW THAT GOES AGAINST A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR ME, PERHAPS, WANTING TO SEE SOMEONE DIFFERENT, BUT BASED ON THE PROCEDURE AND BASED ON THE TREATMENT THAT I HAVE RECEIVED AND THE RESPECT THAT I HAVE FOR MY COLLEAGUES, I WILL BE VOTING FOR ZACK TO REMAIN ON PLANNING COMMISSION.
01:27:47.150: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
01:27:48.819: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  SO, FIRST, I WANT TO START BY ACKNOWLEDGING THAT COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN HAS WORKED HARD ON THE PLANNING COMMISSION, AND THAT WORKLOAD IS MUCH APPRECIATED, BUT I THINK IT'S TIME FOR US TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SO MUCH OF WHAT COMES FROM PLANNING COMMISSION ENDS UP BEING CONTROVERSIAL HERE BECAUSE RESIDENTS AREN'T HEARD AT PLANNING. THE PROBLEMS THAT ARE BEING RAISED IN THE PLANNING PROCESS ARE NOT BEING ADDRESSED BY THE PLANNING COMMISSION. I BELIEVE THAT AS WE EMBARK ON A MASTER PLAN REVIEW, WE NEED TO HAVE DIFFERENT REPRESENTATION ON PLANNING TO REPRESENT THE WISHES OF OUR WHOLE COMMUNITY, AND NOT JUST DEVELOPERS AND NOT JUST PEOPLE WHO SUBSCRIBE TO THE IDEA THAT ALL DENSITY IS GOOD, SO, WHILE I APPRECIATE THE VERY HARD WORK THAT COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN HAS PUT INTO THAT POSITION, I BELIEVE THAT IT'S ACTUALLY TIME FOR US TO HAVE A DIFFERENT POINT OF VIEW ON THAT COMMISSION.
01:28:57.120: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER SMITH.
01:28:58.021: >> COUNCILMEMBER SMITH:  I'M GOING TO ECHO A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI SAID, WHICH IS THIS BODY, COLLEGIALITY HAS DISAPPEARED. IT IS OPENLY HOSTILE TO BOTH THE PUBLIC AND EACH OTHER. COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN, YOU MIGHT NOT LIKE HIS PHILOSOPHY ON PROVIDING OUR INPUT TO PLANNING COMMISSION DECISIONS, I FEEL HAS DONE AN OUTSTANDING JOB OF LISTENING TO ALL SIDES AT THE PLANNING COMMISSION, HAVING THOUGHTFUL AND REASONED DEBATE, AND PLANNING COMMISSION IS A TECHNICALLY DIFFICULT POSITION TO BE IN. THERE'S A LOT YOU HAVE TO DO. HIS JOB IS VERY DIFFICULT. IT'S OFTEN TELLING PEOPLE THAT ORDINANCES ALLOW THINGS TO BE BUILT THAT PEOPLE DON'T WANT BUILT, AND THAT JOB STINKS. YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT THIS IS JUST SOME MORE POSTURING IN THE SAME VEIN THAT THE COMMISSION REAPPOINTMENTS WENT THROUGH DURING MAY. I'M DISAPPOINTED. I THINK THAT WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS, AND, YOU KNOW, I WOULD URGE PEOPLE TO SUPPORT MY COLLEAGUE.
01:30:07.290: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
01:30:12.462: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  I'M HEARING -- I'M HEARING A LOT OF LIKE REALLY SOFT AND SQUISHY TERMS THAT ARE SORT OF WHAT I WOULD CATEGORIZE AS BASICALLY SENTIMENT. I REALLY THINK THAT WE CAN MAKE THIS DECISION WITHOUT ACCUSING PEOPLE OF LACKING RESPECT FOR EACH OTHER OR LACKING COLLEGIALITY. THE WAY I SEE IT, WE HAVE A LOT TO BE GRATEFUL FOR IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH TIME COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN HAS INVESTED IN THE PLANNING COMMISSION AND THE AMOUNT OF RESPONSIBILITY THAT HE TOOK ON, AND I THINK WE CAN APPRECIATE THAT AT THE SAME TIME AS WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE APPROPRIATENESS OF SHIFTING THIS RESPONSIBILITY ON TO SOMEBODY ELSE. WE HAVE HAD A NUMBER OF CLOSED SESSIONS IN THE SHORT TIME THAT I HAVE BEEN ON COUNCIL AROUND LEGAL ISSUES ABOUT OUR PLANNING DECISIONS AND ABOUT DEVELOPMENTS THAT ARE COMING DOWN THE PIKE, AND I THINK IT'S TIME FOR US TO HAVE SOMEBODY ON PLANNING WHO HAS A STRONGER LEGAL BACKGROUND. I'M NOT VOLUNTEERING MYSELF, BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN HAS PUT INTO THIS JOB, AND I AM GRATEFUL FOR THE COMMUNICATION THAT I HAVE HAD WITH MY COLLEAGUE ABOUT -- AROUND HIS JOB AS OUR LIAISON TO PLANNING. I DON'T MEAN TO DIMINISH ANY OF THAT, AND SO I JUST WOULD LIKE TO MAKE THE COMMENT THAT WE CAN MAKE -- WE CAN MOVE FORWARD WITH A DECISION TO CHOOSE SOMEBODY ELSE, AND IT'S NOT ABOUT ANYBODY BEING MEAN TO ANYONE ELSE. IT'S NOT ABOUT A LACK OF RESPECT. IT'S JUST ABOUT MAKING A DIFFERENT CHOICE, AND THOSE ARE THE REASONS WHY I WOULD SUPPORT SOMEBODY ELSE ON PLANNING, SPECIFICALLY, COUNCILMEMBER EATON. THANK YOU.
01:31:50.326: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
01:31:51.861: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRAND:  THANK YOU. FIRST, I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO THE WORK THAT COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN HAS DONE ON THE PLANNING COMMISSION. IT REQUIRES A TREMENDOUS INTELLECT TO DO THIS WORK, SOMEONE WHO CAN SOAK UP A LOT OF INFORMATION AND PRESENT IT IN A COMPREHENSIBLE FORM, AND IT HAS BEEN A PLEASURE AS HIS WARD COLLEAGUE TO SEE JUST HIS QUICK MASTERY OF SO MANY OF THESE PLANNING TERMS. I DON'T THINK YOU NEED A LEGAL BACKGROUND. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE ATTORNEYS WHO ARE THERE TO ADVISE THE PLANNING COMMISSION AND WHO WORK CLOSELY, SO I CERTAINLY DON'T THINK THAT A BACKGROUND IN LABOR LAW IS REALLY RELEVANT TO ONE'S CAPACITY TO SERVE ON THE PLANNING COMMISSION. PRIOR TO COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN, WE HAD COUNCILMEMBER BRAYER, WHO MANY ALSO THOUGHT SERVED ADMIRABLY WHO ALSO WAS NOT AN ATTORNEY. I REALLY DO APPRECIATE THE WAY IN WHICH COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN PRESENTS THE INFORMATION, AND I THINK HE IS COMPREHENSIVE. HE PUTS IN THE TIME. I DO SHARE THE FEELINGS ECHOED BY COUNCILMEMBER SMITH THAT THIS REALLY IS SIMILAR TO THE ATTACKS THAT WERE MADE IN NOT NOMINATING -- IN NOT NOMINATING CERTAIN MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY WHO DID A FANTASTIC JOB TO BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS FOR POLITICAL REASONS, AND IT'S NOT NAME CALLING ANYONE AT THIS TABLE. I'M JUST CALLING IT LIKE I SEE IT, AND I WON'T BE SOFT AND SQUISHY ABOUT IT. I'LL BE REALLY STRAIGHTFORWARD. IN THE PAST, WE HAVE ALL SUPPORTED ONE ANOTHER'S NOMINATIONS TO SERVE ON BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS. THAT HAS BEEN OUR PAST PRACTICE, TO TRY TO SPREAD IT AROUND IN A WAY THAT'S EQUITABLE, BUT, ULTIMATELY, THE APPOINTMENT TO BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS IN ALMOST EVERY CASE, AND CERTAINLY IN THIS ONE, RESTS WITH THE MAYOR. IF COUNCILMEMBER EATON WANTED TO APPOINT HIMSELF TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION, HE SHOULD HAVE WON THE MAYORAL RACE. HE DID NOT, AND NOW IT IS MAYOR TAYLOR'S JOB TO APPOINT SOMEONE TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION. HE HAS CHOSEN TO APPOINT COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN, BECAUSE HE HAS DONE AN EXCELLENT JOB. SO, TO SAY, COUNCILMEMBER NELSON, THAT YOU SUPPORT COUNCILMEMBER EATON, I GUESS YOUR GUY SHOULD HAVE WON LAST TIME. HE DIDN'T, AND THIS IS THE KIND OF CONTENTIOUS BEHAVIOR THAT IS UPSETTING PEOPLE, BUT IF YOU'RE GOING TO PLAY IT ONE WAY, I'M GOING TO PLAY IT RIGHT BACK AT YOU, AND THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. IT'S COMPLETELY UPSETTING TO ME TO SEE OUR BODY DETERIORATE LIKE THIS, AND TO CALL OUT OUR COLLEAGUES INDIVIDUALLY AND SAY THAT, OH, IT'S NOTHING PERSONAL, BUT, YOU KNOW, WE ARE JUST GOING TO NOT SUPPORT YOU, EVEN THOUGH YOU'VE DONE AN OUTSTANDING JOB. THAT HAS NOT BEEN OUR PRACTICE. I HOPE IT IS NOT OUR PRACTICE GOING FORWARD. AND I HOPE IF COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN IS NOT SUPPORTED TONIGHT THAT MAYOR TAYLOR DOESN'T NOMINATE ANYONE, AND HE JUST CONTINUES TO SERVE ON THE PLANNING COMMISSION, BECAUSE HE'S NOT GOING TO NOMINATE YOUR GUY AS LONG AS I'M SITTING HERE AT THIS TABLE AND I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT IT.
01:35:01.551: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER THEN LUMM.
01:35:07.891: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I GUESS -- I GUESS I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT FANTASTIC JOB AND A TERRIFIC JOB IS IN THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER, AND I DIDN'T KNOW THIS WAS GOING TO COME TO A ROLL CALL VOTE LIKE THIS, AND SO I HAVE TO GO BACK AND KIND OF ON THE FLY HERE THINK ABOUT -- THINK ABOUT WHAT, YOU KNOW, HOW I'M GOING TO VOTE ON THIS, AND I HAVE GOT TO TELL YOU, I AM -- I GOT A PHONE CALL WHEN I WAS ON VACATION FROM A DEVELOPER WHO WAS EXTRAORDINARILY CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR PROJECT GETTING VOTED DOWN AT THIS TABLE, AND I ACTUALLY VOTED FOR THAT PROJECT, SO I AM NOT SURE WHY THEY CALLED ME TO COMPLAIN ABOUT IT, AND IT WAS THE BRIGHTDAWN PROJECT, AND IT WAS KIND OF A CURIOUS THING, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, I HAD VOTED FOR IT. IT DIDN'T PASS. I WAS DISAPPOINTED, AND I FIGURED THEY WERE GOING TO GET THEIR 120 UNITS OVER IN THAT CORNER OF THE WORLD, AND I SUPPORTED THE LARGER PROJECT THAT HAD AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING COMPONENT TO IT, AND THEY EXPRESSED A CONCERN. THEY SAID THAT THEY WERE AFRAID THAT COUNCIL WAS SOMEHOW SWAYED BY OUR WANNA BE -- IT WAS INSULTING, AND I TOLD HIM AS MUCH ON THE PHONE. BUT THE THING ABOUT THAT VOTE THAT FOR ME WAS SO ODD, AND I SAT HERE A COUPLE OF WEEKS BEFORE AND I WATCHED MY COLLEAGUE MR. ACKERMAN BERATE THE RESIDENTS WHO HAD COME UP HERE AND ASKED NOT TO HAVE A SENIOR HOUSING COMPLEX NEXT TO THEIR HOMES, AND HE SAID THAT MY VALUES -- MY VALUES TRUMP YOUR COMPLAINTS ABOUT YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD. MY VALUES FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING TRUMP THIS, AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS REALLY HOSTILE TO THAT PUBLIC, IN MY OPINION, AND, YOU KNOW, TWO WEEKS LATER, HE VOTED AGAINST BRIGHTDAWN, WHICH HAPPENED TO BE IN YOUR WARD AND PROVIDED AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND ALL OF THE THINGS THAT YOUR VALUES SAID, YOU KNOW, TRUMP THESE NEIGHBORHOOD CONCERNS, AND I DIDN'T GET THAT. THAT DIDN'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO ME, AND I WAS SURPRISED THAT WE WERE ON OPPOSITE SIDES OF THAT VOTE, AND SO, YOU KNOW, I JUST THINK THAT ALL OF THIS TALK OF WE ARE BEING MEAN TO THE PUBLIC, PEOPLE ARE RUDE TO THE PUBLIC, PEOPLE ARE RUDE TO THE STAFF, WELL, IT'S NONSENSE. WE ARE VOTING HERE ON THE ISSUES. SOMETIMES WE DON'T HAVE A CHANCE TO CONSIDER THESE ISSUES. I DON'T SIT AROUND AND THINK DOES ZACK DO A GOOD JOB ON PLANNING ALL THE TIME, DO WE HAVE GOOD RESULTS ON PLANNING. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO THINK ABOUT IT AND DO A ROLL CALL VOTE ON PLANNING. THAT WAS A HORRIBLE WAY TO TREAT THE PUBLIC. I WAS ASHAMED TO SIT UP HERE AND LISTEN TO COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN BERATE THOSE PEOPLE FOR TRYING TO STOP THIS THING FROM LOOMING UP, OVER ZONING, LOOMING UP NEXT TO HIM, AND I ACTUALLY VOTED FOR THAT ONE TOO, SO IT WASN'T MY MORALS OR MY VALUES ABOUT THE SIZE OF THE PROJECT BUT THE WAY IN WHICH THAT PUBLIC WAS TREATED, SO I'M JUST GOING TO STOP NOW, SO, THANK YOU.
01:38:02.632: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
01:38:03.499: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. THIS IS AWKWARD FOR ALL OF US, THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT ONE OF OUR COLLEAGUES, AND I WAS NOT INTENDING TO SPEAK TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION APPOINTMENT, WHICH IS WHY I HAD, OVER THE COURSE OF THIS, WHEN I REALIZED THAT COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN'S LIAISON APPOINTMENT HAD EXPIRED AT THE END OF JUNE REACHED OUT TO YOU, MR. MAYOR, AND I BELIEVE I COPIED ALL OF COUNCIL, JUST TO LET THEM KNOW THAT WE NEEDED TO RESOLVE THIS, AND SUBSEQUENT TO THAT, I -- YOU KNOW, IN MY EMAILS TO MR. ACKERMAN, I -- I THOUGHT I WAS PRETTY CLEAR ABOUT WHERE I WAS HEADED WITH THIS RECOMMENDATION, AND SO, AGAIN, I WASN'T PLANNING TO SPEAK TO THIS TONIGHT, AND FRANKLY, GIVEN THAT I -- I WAS A BIT SURPRISED, NONE OF WHICH IS TO SAY I DON'T THINK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN, HAVE NOT DONE A VERY GOOD JOB ON THE PLANNING COMMISSION. AS YOU KNOW, I HAVE ALWAYS SUPPORTED YOU IN THE PAST, BUT I AM RELUCTANT TO DO THAT NOW, AND I HOPE THAT FROM MY EMAIL COMMUNICATIONS THAT YOU WERE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHERE I WAS COMING FROM AND WHY. I WILL JUST SAY THAT I DO NOT THINK THAT FOR ANY OF US IT'S POLITICAL, THAT ANYBODY IS POSTURING. I MEAN THAT WHEN I SAY THAT, COUNCILMEMBER SMITH, THAT WE HAVE DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES, DIFFERENT VIEWS, AND WE NEED TO RESPECT THAT, AND WE EACH ONE OF US ASSESS THESE APPOINTMENTS INDIVIDUALLY. WE HAVE OUR OWN VIEW, TAKE ON EXPECTATIONS, AND IN THIS PLANNING UNIVERSE TODAY, THERE'S -- IT'S EVOLVING AT A PRETTY QUICK PACE RIGHT NOW, AS WE UNDERTAKE THE -- IN NEW DIRECTIONS, POTENTIALLY, AS WE UNDERTAKE THE HIRING OF A CONSULTANT FOR THE -- TO DEVELOP A NEW MASTER PLAN, AND AS THE COMMUNITY THEN WORKS ON AND DISCUSSES AND INTERACTS WITH ALL OF US ON PROVIDING THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS ON A NEW CITY MASTER PLAN, SO THAT COUPLED WITH SOME RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, IN TERMS OF SOME OF THE SPECIFIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OTHER MATTERS HAS -- HAS INFLUENCED MY VIEW, AND I GUESS I'LL JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT, BUT PLEASE DON'T TAKE IT AS A PERSONAL ASSESSMENT OF YOUR ABILITY. IT'S JUST, I THINK -- I THINK EVERYBODY HAS A VALID REASON FOR MAKING A RECOMMENDATION, AND I WILL NOT QUESTION THEIR MOTIVES.
01:41:25.801: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? I AM, OF COURSE, GOING TO BE SUPPORTING COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN. I WAS PROUD TO NOMINATE HIM A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO. I'M PROUD TO NOMINATE HIM AGAIN. HE HAS DONE AN OUTSTANDING JOB, I BELIEVE, REPRESENTING ALL ASPECTS OF THIS CITY. THAT IS TO SAY, YOU KNOW, RESIDENTS FROM ALL NEIGHBORHOODS, HE HAS DONE AN OUTSTANDING JOB COMMUNICATING TO RESIDENTS AT PLANNING COMMISSION ABOUT THE -- YOU KNOW, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO ROLES. THE ROLE OF A PLANNING COMMISSIONER IS DIFFERENT THAN THE ROLE OF A COUNCILMEMBER, AND YOU HAVE TO BIFURCATE THAT WHEN SERVING ON A PLANNING COMMISSION. PLANNING COMMISSION IS A MORE TECHNICAL BOARD THAN THIS IS. THIS IS A POLICY BOARD, AND THERE IS A DIVERGENCE THERE. YOU KNOW, THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT WHEN -- YOU KNOW, IN COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN, WE HAVE SOMEONE WHO CAN COMMUNICATE TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION THE DIRECTION OF COUNCIL. WE HAVE SOMEBODY WHO CAN COMMUNICATE TO COUNCIL THE VIEWS AND THE CONVERSATION AT PLANNING COMMISSION AND CAN DO THAT IN A MANNER THAT IS STRAIGHT UP AND EFFICIENT AND CLEAR AND DOES NOT PUT A FINGER ON THE SCALES. I BELIEVE COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN AT THE PLANNING COMMISSION, AND OF COURSE AT THIS TABLE, HAS CONDUCTED HIMSELF IN AN EXEMPLARY FASHION THAT HAS DONE HIMSELF AND THE CITY A GREAT CREDIT, AND I BELIEVE THAT HE HAS EARNED EVERYONE'S -- AND BY THAT SERVICE HAS EARNED EVERYONE'S SUPPORT. FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
01:43:06.569: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR, AND THANK YOU TO COLLEAGUES FOR THE FEEDBACK AND CONVERSATION. I APPARENTLY HAVE VERY GOOD FRIENDS IN COUNCILMEMBER GRAND AND SMITH. I APPRECIATE YOUR IMPASSIONED ARGUMENT. I'M GOING TO TAKE A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT APPROACH IN MY CONVERSATION. THE ROLE OF THE PLANNING COMMISSIONER IS NOT AN EASY ONE. THE BODY MEETS FREQUENTLY AND DEALS WITH SUBJECTS THAT ARE PERHAPS THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL BY THEIR VERY NATURE, HOW WE USE LAND WITHIN OUR VERY FINITE 29 SQUARE MILES AS A CITY, AND THERE IS NOT A LOT OF THAT LAND THAT ISN'T BEING USED CURRENTLY, AND THAT MAKES THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE HAVE AT THAT TABLE, AND EVENTUALLY THIS TABLE, ALL THE MORE DIFFICULT. IN APPROACHING THAT DIFFICULT POSITION, I HAVE HAD A PHILOSOPHY THAT, AS A PLANNING COMMISSIONER, MY OBLIGATION TO COUNCIL IS TO GET THE BEST PROPOSAL THROUGH PLANNING COMMISSION TO THIS BODY. IT MAY NOT BE ONE WORTHY OF VOTING YES WHEN IT COMES TO COUNCIL, BUT MY JOB IS TO DELIVER TO YOU THE BEST POSSIBLE VERSION LEAVING PLANNING COMMISSION, SO THAT YOU CAN MAKE A DECISION YES/NO. IF NO, FINE. IF YES, IT'S GOING TO MITIGATE THE MOST EXTREME RISKS, AND THAT'S HOW I'VE APPROACHED IT, AND THAT'S THE PHILOSOPHY I HAVE TAKEN. AS I THINK AROUND THE CITY AND THINK TOWARDS PROJECTS OF SPECIFICITY, I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO TAKE PROBABLY AN UNWISE APPROACH AND TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL THAT I ULTIMATELY ENDED UP SUPPORTING AT COUNCIL BUT WERE VERY CONTROVERSIAL IN THE EYES OF THE NEIGHBORHOODS THAT IMMEDIATELY SURROUNDED THEM. IN WARD 1, I THINK OF LOWER TOWN AND MY COMMITMENT TO RESIDENTS THERE AND TO THE COUNCIL, ULTIMATELY, AND WHILE MY FINAL VOTE AT THIS CITY COUNCIL TABLE WAS PROBABLY NOT ONE POPULAR WITH COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER OR COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, I SAW MY JOB AS A PLANNING COMMISSIONER IN THE 12-18 MONTHS THAT THAT PROJECT WAS BEFORE PLANNING COMMISSION TO CONTINUOUSLY POSTPONE UNTIL WE SAW MOVEMENT THAT WOULD MAKE A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE, MOVING THE NORTHERNMOST BUILDING FURTHER FROM TRAVER CREEK, LOWERING THE HEIGHT IMMEDIATELY ADJACENT TO THE HISTORIC NEIGHBORHOOD, SHIFTING MASSING TOWARDS U OF M'S PARKING STRUCTURES. IN WARD 2, I VOTED FOR SOUTH POND, A FAIRLY INTRUSIVE McMANSION DEVELOPMENT BEHIND ARBOR LAND, AND I VOTED FOR IT, BECAUSE IT WAS BY RIGHT, AND I BELIEVED WE WOULD EXPOSE OURSELVES TO LEGAL RISK IF WE DIDN'T. BUT WHEN BRICKS MOORE, A MAJOR DEVELOPER, BROUGHT A VERY BIG BOX PROPOSAL BEHIND ARBORLAND, I SAID NO AND HOPEFULLY AVOIDED A VERY PAINFUL AND LENGTHY CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT DEVELOPMENT AND REZONING. ON THE WEST SIDE OF TOWN, I THINK OF LOCKWOOD, AND I FIRST WANT TO ADDRESS COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER'S COMMENTS. AND I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT. I HEARD A NUMBER OF ARGUMENTS THAT RUBBED MY VALUES THE WRONG WAY FOR A LONG TIME, AFTER A LONG TIME OF DEALING WITH HEARINGS AT PLANNING COMMISSION, AND I GOT MY -- I LET MY EMOTIONS GET THE BETTER OF ME, BUT AT THE VERY NEXT COUNCIL MEETING, I APOLOGIZED FOR THOSE STATEMENTS AND FOR MY TONE, AND I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT, AND I LET THAT GET THE BETTER OF ME AT THE COUNCIL TABLE. BUT AT THE PLANNING COMMISSION TABLE, I WORKED DILIGENTLY, AGAIN, OVER A VERY LENGTHY TIME FRAME, 18 MONTHS PLUS, TO TRY TO GET THEM TO REDUCE THE SIZE OF THE BUILDING, WHICH THEY ULTIMATELY DID BY 6,000 SQUARE FEET TO REDUCE THE SIZE OF THE UNITS, REDUCE THE NUMBER OF TWO-BEDROOM UNITS TO ONE-BEDROOM UNITS, WHICH WOULD MAKE THEM MORE AFFORDABLE, MAKE SURE THAT WRAPPED INTO THE DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT WERE ASPECTS ABOUT HOW THEY WOULD TREAT THE PROPERTY WITH RESPECT TO ECOLOGICAL ISSUES SURROUNDING, AND ULTIMATELY THAT WAS VOTED DOWN, AND THAT'S FINE, BUT I SAW IT AS MY OBLIGATION TO BRING FORWARD THE BEST POSSIBLE PROPOSAL SO THAT WHATEVER HAPPENED, CRITICAL RISKS WOULD BE MITIGATED. MORE THAN THAT, I HAVE ALSO SEEN MYSELF AS A LEGISLATOR AT THAT TABLE AND AN IMPORTANT BRIDGE, AND A LOT OF THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE IS THAT OUR ZONING POLICIES ARE OUT OF DATE OR GIVE US PRODUCTS THAT WE DON'T WANT, AND I HAVE TRIED TO CHIP AWAY BY LISTENING AT THIS TABLE TO MAJOR ISSUES IN OUR ZONING CODE, FROM DOWNTOWN DEVELOPMENT AND THE ATTRACTIVENESS THAT PEOPLE COMPLAINED ABOUT, I BROUGHT FORWARD AND HELPED SHEPHERD THROUGH PLANNING COMMISSION AND ULTIMATELY PASSED AT THIS TABLE NEW DESIGN REQUIREMENTS FOR OUR DOWNTOWN BUILDINGS, WHICH WON'T ALLOW THE TACKY STUFF WE SAW AT THE EARLY PART OF THE 2010s AND INSTEAD PUSHES DEVELOPERS TOWARDS MORE HIGH QUALITY MATERIALS THAT IMPACT THE STREETSCAPE IN A MORE POSITIVE WAY. HOPEFULLY IN OCTOBER, WE'LL BE BRINGING FORWARD REVISIONS IT OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING PREMIUM, WHICH WILL STOP, YOU KNOW, ESSENTIALLY INCENTIVIZING DEVELOPERS TO DO WHAT THEY WOULD HAVE DONE ANYWAYS AND REQUIRING THEM TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN RESPONSE TO OUR HOUSING CRISIS. FROM MEDICAL MARIJUANA TO FRONT YARD SOLAR TO FRATERNITIES AND SORORITIES, AND I SEE THE NEXT AS RESPONDING TO THE SHORT-TERM RENTAL AND AIRBNB ISSUE. I THINK ULTIMATELY I HAVE LOOKED BOTH FROM COUNCIL TO THE PLANNING TABLE AND FROM THE PLANNING TABLE TO COUNCIL AND TRIED TO OBLIGATE TO RESPONSIBILITIES FROM BOTH, FROM EACH BODY. AND MORE THAN THAT, I THINK YOU HAVE A PLANNING COMMISSION THAT HAS A -- YOU KNOW, WHILE THERE IS DIVERSITY OF THOUGHT, THERE'S DEFINITELY A FORWARD LOOK AND A LOOK TO WHAT ARE THE BEST PRACTICES AND CUTTING-EDGE POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS THAT CAN BE MADE, AND I THINK I'M SOMEONE WHO CAN SPEAK THAT LANGUAGE AND PROVIDE A CONDUIT, AND I TRULY DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S ANYONE WHO WOULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE IN SPEAKING TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION AND PUSHING THEM TOWARDS THE AGENDA OF THIS COUNCIL THAN MYSELF. SO I'LL LEAVE IT THERE, AND I WOULD ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE HONOR AND PRIVILEGE TO CONTINUE TO SERVE THE COMMUNITY IN THIS CAPACITY.
01:49:28.450: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
01:49:30.719: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD:  FOR ME, IT'S A VERY SIMPLE PROCESS QUESTION, AND THAT IS HOW CAN WE MINIMIZE THE RISK TO THE CITY, AND THE ANSWER THAT I COME UP WITH IS THAT WE NEED THE PLANNING COMMISSION TO BE AS MUCH IN LINE WITH THE COUNCIL SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO VOTE NO AT THE COUNCIL TABLE, SO WE NEED THAT CONTINUITY, AND WE HAD AN ELECTION LAST YEAR, AND I THINK WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AS WELL AS MINIMIZE THE RISK TO THE CITY.
01:50:17.199: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
01:50:18.100: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  THANK YOU, AND IT'S BEEN A LONG DEBATE ALREADY BEFORE WE EVEN GET TO THE CONSENT AGENDA. I JUST WANT TO SAY THERE IS A LOT OF DIFFERENT VIEW-POINTS IN THIS COMMUNITY, OBVIOUSLY, AND THERE ALWAYS WILL BE, AND IT'S IMPORTANT FOR EACH OF US TO REACH ACROSS THE AISLE AND WORK WITH PEOPLE THAT HAVE DIFFERENT VIEW-POINTS, AND I FEAR THAT THIS COUNCIL IS INEPT IN DOING THAT RIGHT NOW, AND IN SAYING THAT, YOU KNOW, I DID CAMPAIGN TWICE, AND I CAMPAIGNED ON THE FACT THAT I THOUGHT PRIOR COUNCIL WAS TOO MUCH OF A RUBBER STAMP. AND HERE WE HAVE COUNCILMEMBERS ASKING FOR A RUBBER STAMP. SO I JUST WANT TO THROW THAT OUT THERE. IT'S GOOD TO HAVE DISCUSSION. IT'S GOOD TO HAVE DEBATE. IT'S GOOD TO HAVE DIFFERENT VIEWPOINTS ALL BEING REPRESENTED. IN THE END, WE HAVE THE VOTE AS COUNCILMEMBERS. WE ARE THE ONE IN THE END WHO HAVE THE ULTIMATE VOTE. I DON'T KNOW WHO THE BOOGY MAN IS HERE RIGHT NOW.
01:51:17.826: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE PLEASE STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER SMITH. SMITH?
01:51:24.533: >> COUNCILMEMBER SMITH: RAMLAWI?

01:51:43.652: >> CLERK BEAUDRY:  THE MOTION FAILS.
01:51:45.487: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  MAY I HAVE A MOTION PLEASE WITH RESPECT TO THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION, DEANNA LERNIHAN, MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER SMITH, SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER. DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [ CHORUS OF AYES ]
01:52:01.737: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  I'M SORRY. COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD?
01:52:03.605: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD:  I AM THE COUNCIL REPRESENTATIVE TO THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION. I WAS VERY INVOLVED, ALTHOUGH NOT A MEMBER OF THE NONMOTORIZED TRANSPORTATION TASK FORCE, AND ADVOCATED STRONGLY AND WAS SUCCESSFUL IN CREATING A TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION RATHER THAN JUST A NONMOTORIZED ORGANIZATION, AND MY FEAR AT THIS POINT IS THAT WHILE IT'S NAMED THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION, THERE IS NO ONE ON IT REALLY THAT REPRESENTS MOTORIZED VEHICLES, NOR DO WE HAVE AN ENGINEER ASSIGNED TO IT, SO I SEE, WHILE I WILL BE VOTING YES TONIGHT, I THINK THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS THOSE DEFICIENCIES.
01:52:51.253: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [ CHORUS OF AYES ] OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. WE NOW HAVE BEFORE US THE CONSENT AGENDA. MAY I HAVE A MOTION PLEASE TO APPROVE THE CONSENT AGENDA? MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER SMITH. DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
01:53:08.804: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  I WOULD LIKE TO PULL CA-19, PLEASE.
01:53:15.711: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
01:53:16.645: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  I JUST HAD DISCUSSION.
01:53:20.549: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
01:53:23.118: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  I JUST WANTED TO COMMENT ON THREE AND FOUR, BRIEFLY. WE ARE ACCEPTING EASEMENTS FROM KINGSLEY CONDOS, AND I APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S SUPPORT ON THAT, BECAUSE WE NEED ALL OF THE SQUARE FOOTAGE THAT WE CAN GET TO CREATE THIS ALAN CREEK GREENWAY OR THE TREELINE TRAIL, AND THE EARLY EFFORT BEHIND THAT PROJECT WAS DON'T BUILD ANYTHING ON TOP OF ALAN CREEK, AND NOW WE ARE BUILDING THINGS ON TOP OF ALAN CREEK, AND SO SLIVERING OUT THESE LITTLE PARCELS OR RIGHT-OF-WAYS I GUESS ARE THE SECOND BEST THING THAT WE CAN DO FOR THAT TRAIL, SO I URGE EVERYONE TO SUPPORT THIS, BECAUSE IT NEEDS EIGHT VOTES, AND ALSO THANKS TO THE DEVELOPERS FOR GIVING THESE EASEMENTS. WE ARE TAKING WHAT WE CAN GET HERE, AND LIKE I SAY, WE NEED ALL OF IT, AND THIS IS THE THIRD EASEMENT THAT WE ARE GETTING FROM A DEVELOPMENT, SO IT'S SLOWLY COMING TOGETHER, AND IT'S IMPORTANT.
01:54:14.169: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
01:54:17.472: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD:  IS IT NOW APPROPRIATE TO REMOVE CA-19?
01:54:22.544: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD:
01:54:30.719: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  IT'S BEEN REMOVED ALREADY. ALL IN FAVOR? [ CHORUS OF AYES ] ALL VOTING THE AFFIRMATIVE, THUS SATISFYING THE EIGHT VOTE REQUIREMENT WITH RESPECT TO CA1, CA2, CA3, CA4, AND CA20. CA 19 -- RESOLUTION TO AUTHORIZE A PROFESSIONAL SERVICES AGREEMENT WITH ORCHARD, HILTZ & MCCLIMENT, INC. (OHM) FOR THE LOWER TOWN AREA MOBILITY STUDY (RFP NO. 18-21) ($579,478.00) DISCUSSION PLEASE OF CA-19, COUNCILMEMBER EATON?
01:55:11.827: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  THANK YOU. WHEN IT ORIGINALLY CAME BEFORE US, IT WAS A CONTRACT FOR $662,000, AND WE RAISED ISSUES ABOUT THE EXPENSE COMPARED TO THE SECOND HIGHEST BIDDER, WHICH WAS ABOUT $402,000, A DIFFERENCE OF $260,000. IT WAS REFERRED BACK TO STAFF, AND RATHER THAN RECOMMEND THE LOWER OF THE TWO BIDS, THEY RENEGOTIATED THIS AND LOWERED THE PRICE. IT NOW COMES BEFORE US AT A PRICE OF $579,000, WHICH IS ADMITTEDLY $83,000 LESS THAN THE ORIGINAL BID, BUT IT WAS APPARENTLY DONE BY REMOVING SERVICES, NOT ACTUALLY LOWERING THE PRICE FOR THE SERVICES THAT WERE REQUESTED, SO I HAVE OPPOSED THIS ON THE BASIS OF PRICE EVERY TIME IT'S COME BEFORE US. I AM GOING TO OPPOSE IT AGAIN THIS EVENING. THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR A TRAFFIC STUDY FOR JUST A SMALL AREA OF TOWN, AND SO I'LL BE VOTING AGAINST THIS.
01:56:23.598: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
01:56:24.499: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. YEAH, THE PRICE IS A CONCERN. YOU KNOW, WE HAVE GOT TO TALK ABOUT FAST-MOVING -- LOTS OF MOVING PIECES. I MEAN, THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON HERE, RIGHT? WE HAVE A ROUNDABOUT THAT'S GOING TO BE INCLUDED IN THIS AND MANY OTHER THINGS, AND THE WHEREAS CLAUSE IN THIS REALLY TELLS THE TALE, WHICH IS ONE OF THE REASONS THAT I WAS HAPPY TO SEE THE UNIVERSITY FOLKS HERE. IT SAYS WHEREAS INCREASED COMMUTER TRAFFIC IN NORTHERN AREAS OF THE CITY AND INCREASED ENROLLMENT AT THE UNIVERSITY -- RESEARCH FACILITIES CAN REASONABLY BE EXPECTED TO ADD DEMAND TO THE CITY'S MOBILITY NETWORK. YEAH, NO KIDDING, AND THE 1500 CAR PARKING STRUCTURE THEY ARE PUTTING IN, SO I'M LOATHE TO PUT THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR RESIDENTS IN THIS. THESE PROBLEMS ARE CREATED BY THE UNIVERSITY'S EXPANSION AND CONTINUED GOOD WELFARE OF THE UNIVERSITY, AND THAT'S JUST HOW IT IS. AND WE ARE PAYING FOR THAT. WE ARE PAYING A LOT FOR THAT, AND I UNDERSTAND THAT, YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE TO DO A STUDY AT SOME POINT, IF WE ARE GOING TO REWORK THAT AREA, BUT THE ONLY REASON WE ARE REWORKING THAT AREA IS BECAUSE OF THE EXPANSION OF THE UNIVERSITY, AND I JUST -- I CAN'T SUPPORT PUTTING THE TAXPAYERS ON THE HOOK FOR THAT.
01:57:40.175: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:57:44.713: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  I UNDERSTAND MY COLLEAGUE'S FRUSTRATION WITH THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM BEING THE INCREASED COMMUTER TRAFFIC, BUT THE FACT IS THE UNIVERSITY IS NOT WILLING TO DO A WHOLE LOT RIGHT NOW. AND WE CAN SIT AROUND AND POINT FINGERS ALL DAY. THAT'S NOT GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM. AND IT'S THE RESIDENTS OF ANN ARBOR, THE BUSINESSES OF ANN ARBOR, THE VISITORS OF ANN ARBOR THAT PAY THE PRICE, AND, YOU KNOW, I'M NO TRAFFIC ENGINEER, BUT I KNOW THAT YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR, AND, YOU KNOW, I'LL JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT, THAT THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT CHOKE POINT IN OUR CITY. IT'S JUST ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE, AND IT'S THE USERS OF THE NETWORK THAT ARE PAYING THE PRICE, AND SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS.
01:58:54.816: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
01:58:57.052: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. THE ORIGINS OF THIS, JUST AS A REMINDER, CAME AFTER THE PASSAGE OF THE LOWER TOWN DEVELOPMENT. MAYOR TAYLOR, COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER AND I COSPONSORED A RESOLUTION CALLING FOR THIS, AND THE RFP WENT OUT. I APPRECIATE COUNCIL'S PUSHBACK ON THE PRICE. I THINK IT'S GREAT TO SEE THE REDUCTION OF OVER $80,000. IT'S NOT SURPRISING TO ME THAT THEIR RESPONSE TO BRINGING THE PRICE DOWN WAS TO REMOVE SERVICES. I WORKED FOR A CONSULTING FIRM. I WRITE PROPOSALS, AT LEAST ONE A DAY ALL YEAR, AND IF YOU GIVE UP, YOU KNOW, SERVICES FOR FREE ONCE, YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO CHARGE FOR THEM AGAIN, AND THAT'S JUST HOW BUSINESS WORKS, ESPECIALLY IN THIS WORLD. I THINK THIS IS A MODEST INVESTMENT TO INFORM HOW WE ARE GOING TO BE SPENDING MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN INFRASTRUCTURE. THE CONCRETE AND THE ASPHALT THAT WE ULTIMATELY PUT IN THESE AREAS NEEDS TO BE INFORMED BY COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND NEEDS TO BE INFORMED BY DATA, NEEDS TO BE INFORMED BY FUTURE PLANNING THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT ALL OF THE DEVELOPMENT, BOTH UNIVERSITY AS WELL AS RESIDENTIAL, THAT'S ALREADY BEEN PASSED AND DESTINED TO COME, IF NOT THIS YEAR THEN CERTAINLY IN THE NEXT 20, AND THIS IS, I BELIEVE, A PROPER INVESTMENT TO PUT IN PLACE A WELL-ROUNDED PLAN TO ENSURE WE SPEND MILLIONS UPON MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN OUR CONCRETE AND ASPHALT INFRASTRUCTURE WISELY.
02:00:38.553: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER LUMM OR GRISWOLD? I KIND OF FORGOT. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM AND THEN GRISWOLD.
02:00:43.758: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. SO, NO QUESTION, AND I RECOGNIZE THIS IS VERY COSTLY, BUT I ALSO THINK THAT THE CHALLENGE IS STILL SIGNIFICANT, AND THE POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS TO THE TRAFFIC CHALLENGES ARE NOT GOING TO JUST, YOU KNOW, MAGICALLY APPEAR WITHOUT A DETAILED STUDY. I MEAN, I'M CERTAINLY OKAY SAVING MONEY, BUT I BELIEVE THAT MAY BE SHORTSIGHTED, AND AGAIN, BUT TO THE HISTORY, AS WE ALL KNOW, THE TOTAL BUDGET FOR THE STUDY IS JUST UNDER $602,000, A LOT OF MONEY. THE RFP WAS CONDUCTED BACK IN 2018. OHM WAS RECOMMENDED BY STAFF AND COUNCIL IN OCTOBER OF 2018. WE POSTPONED IT PER THE AGREEMENT IN ORDER TO NEGOTIATE THE LOWER COST. THE COST WAS REDUCED A BIT, BUT IN FEBRUARY OF 2019, COUNCIL DIDN'T AGREE THAT -- THE FISCAL YEAR '19 BUDGET, SO THEN IN MARCH OF 2019, WE VOTED TO INCLUDE THIS IN THE BUDGET, THIS AMOUNT, AND THAT RESOLUTION DID DIRECT THE ADMINISTRATOR TO REOPEN NEGOTIATIONS WITH OHM, AND THEY AGREED TO NOT RAISE THE PRICE NEGOTIATED LAST FALL, THAT, AS WE ALL RECOGNIZE, THEY WOULD REDUCE THE PRICE FURTHER WITHOUT A SCOPE REDUCTION. I UNDERSTAND THAT. THAT'S REASONABLE. SO, I HAVE SUPPORTED THIS IN THE PAST. I DON'T WANT US TO BE SHORT-SIGHTED. I THINK THIS WAS REALLY TRIGGERED BY THE LARGE DEVELOPMENT, THE LOWER TOWN DEVELOPMENT, AND WE ARE -- U OFM BRINGS A LOT OF PEOPLE INTO THAT AREA, AS WE ALL KNOW. THEY ARE BUILDING THIS PARKING STRUCTURE, AND THERE ARE A LOT OF AREAS WHERE U OF M COULD HELP US OUT BY FRANKLY WRITING US A NICE CHECK, HERE, THE FIRE STATION, NORTH CAMPUS, HOUSING AND MANY OTHER THINGS THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL, BUT I -- AND I BELIEVE WE HAVE ASKED ABOUT U OF M'S CONTRIBUTING TO THIS TRAFFIC STUDY, THE COST, HELPING TO UNDERWRITE IT. DID WE NOT, MR. LAZARUS?
02:03:19.614: >> PART OF THE DISCUSSION ON THE GARAGE OVER WALL STREET, THERE WAS A COMMITMENT FROM THE UNIVERSITY TO HELP ON TRAFFIC MISSION AND THE AREAS AROUND THAT. WE HAVE ASKED FOR THEIR ASSISTANCE.
02:03:35.863: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  SORRY TO SOUND SO CRASS.
02:03:38.399: >> NO, THAT'S FINE. I THINK IT'S GOOD TO BE DIRECT AT TIMES, AND DIRECT ANSWERS, WE HAVE RAISED IT WITH THEM, AND WE'LL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM, FOR THEM TO RECOGNIZE THAT THEY SHOULD MAKE A CONTRIBUTION TO THESE.
02:03:51.779: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  THANK YOU.
02:03:54.382: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD?
02:03:56.250: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD:  I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING THIS TONIGHT FOR FOUR REASONS. NUMBER ONE, WE HAVE A CRISIS IN THIS COMMUNITY REGARDING OUR PEDESTRIAN CRASH RATE. UNTIL WE HIRE AN OPERATIONS MANAGER TO TAKE CARE OF THE DAY-TO-DAY OPERATIONS, I HAVE NO INTEREST IN FURTHER PLANNING. NUMBER TWO, WE TALKED TONIGHT ABOUT HAVING A WORK SESSION WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN. I THINK THAT WE SHOULD DO THAT, AND WE SHOULD HAVE A FRANK DISCUSSION ABOUT THEIR CONTRIBUTION AS WELL AS THE IMPACT THAT THEY HAVE HAD BY CONTINUING TO BUILD PARKING GARAGES. NUMBER -- I THINK I'M AT NUMBER THREE RIGHT NOW, OHM WAS THE FIRM THAT WAS HIRED BY THE ANN ARBOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS. THEY DID A VERY LIMITED SCOPE PROJECT AT HURON. IT HAS LED TO THE PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE NOW. THEY SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER. I HAVE WORKED AS A CONSULTANT. PEOPLE HAVE ASKED ME TO DO THINGS, BUT I HAVE LOOKED AT THE COMPREHENSIVE AREA, AND I WOULD NOT HAVE DONE WHAT O.H.M. DID, AND I DON'T THINK THAT WE SHOULD ENGAGE THAT FIRM UNTIL THEY STEP UP AND RESOLVE THE PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE AT HURON HIGH SCHOOL WITH A REVISION TO THEIR DOCUMENT. NUMBER FOUR, WE RIGHT NOW ARE IN THE PROCESS OF A TRANSPORTATION MASTER PLAN. HOW MANY PLANS CAN WE POSSIBLY HAVE AT THE SAME TIME WITHOUT ADDRESSING OPERATIONS? THANK YOU.
02:05:27.942: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
02:05:28.843: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER: THANKS. I JUST WANTED TO CLEAR UP THAT. YOU KNOW, I'M NOT BEING PENNY WISE AND A POUND OR A DOLLAR FOOLISH. THE OTHER TWO REASONS THAT I DON'T SUPPORT THIS, IT WAS MADE CHEAPER, YES, BY REMOVING SOME OF THE SERVICES, BUT BY REMOVING THE PUBLIC OUTREACH ASPECT OF IT, AND THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT PART TO ME. AND THE OTHER PART WAS, AS YOU MAY RECALL FROM OUR CONVERSATIONS IN THE PRIOR MONTHS, AFTER WE GET THIS COMPLICATED MODEL, WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING WITH IT WITHOUT PAYING AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN TO RUN THESE SIMULATIONS FOR US, AND SO THIS TYPE OF COMPLEX SOFTWARE THAT THEY ARE PUTTING ALL OF THIS DATA INTO WITHOUT THE PUBLIC OUTREACH ASPECT, YOU KNOW, IT ISN'T REALLY OURS, SO IT'S LIKE 600 GRAND AND THEN ANOTHER 50 TO 75,000 ANYTIME WE WANT TO RUN A MODEL ON IT, AND I DON'T SUPPORT THAT TYPE OF INVESTMENT, BECAUSE I DON'T SEE IT AS AN INVESTMENT. I SEE IT AS INVESTING IN A LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIP WITH A CONSULTANT.
02:06:34.976: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER GRAND?
02:06:35.977: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRAND:  THANK YOU. IT'S ACTUALLY MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE MONEY PROPOSED INCLUDES THE MONEY FOR PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT. IF WE WERE TO REMOVE PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT IF YOU SEE IN THE TEXT, IT SAYS IF -- REMOVED FROM THE SCOPE OF WORK, THIS STUDY WILL COST $466,318, AND THEN IF THE ROAD SAFETY AUDIT WAS REMOVED FROM THE SCOPE OF WORK, THE STUDY WOULD COST 519,478. IT WAS GIVING US SOME OTHER OPTIONS BECAUSE OF FEEDBACK -- AND PLEASE, MR. HESS, CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG OR IF YOU WANT TO FURTHER CLARIFY. I AM SURE YOU CAN BE MUCH MORE ELOQUENT THAN I AM READING FROM THIS.
02:07:23.925: >> MR. MAYOR, MEMBERS OF COUNCIL, RAYMOND HESS. CITY STAFF, SO WHAT WE TRIED TO DO IN THE MEMO, AS COUNCILMEMBER GRAND POINTED OUT, WAS PROVIDE SOME OTHER OPTIONS BASED ON THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE UNDERSTOOD TOOK PLACE EARLY THIS YEAR, LATE LAST YEAR WITH REGARD TO THE PRICES. WE LOOKED AT WHAT WERE SOME OTHER THINGS THAT WE COULD DO TO BRING THE COST DOWN THAT WOULD BE COMMENSURATE WITH YOUR EXPECTATIONS. WE ACKNOWLEDGE, AND I THINK THERE WAS A CAUCUS QUESTION ABOUT THOSE WERE BOTH IMPORTANT ELEMENTS OF THE STUDY, BOTH THE OUTROACH AND THE ROAD SAFETY OF IT. THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION WAS TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE ORIGINAL SCOPE AS PROPOSED, BUT IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT IN A DIFFERENT LIGHT, IF WE REMOVE THE PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT, IT'S KIND OF AN ACADEMIC EXERCISE, RIGHT? IT'S A WHITE PAPER. IT'S A TECHNICAL ANALYSIS. IF YOU REMOVE THE ROAD SAFETY AUDIT, THAT COULD BE DONE THROUGH SEPARATE CONTRACT, BUT THOSE ARE -- YOU COULD BREAK THEM OUT AND STILL KIND OF MAINTAIN THE INTEGRITY OF THE ANALYSIS AND THE MODELING TO HELP ANSWER SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU'RE LOOKING TO. BUT, AGAIN, STAFF'S RECOMMENDATION IS TO KEEP THE SCOPE INTACT, AS WAS ULTIMATELY PROPOSED.
02:08:38.900: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRAND:  THANK YOU, AS YOU PUT IT MUCH MORE ELOQUENT THAN I COULD HAVE. IT STRIKES ME AS IT IS KIND OF ODD, BITING THE HAND THAT FEEDS YOU IF YOU'RE FROM THE WARD AND DON'T SUPPORT THIS TRAFFIC STUDY, BECAUSE IT COULD POTENTIALLY SLOW DOWN FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS IN THAT PART OF TOWN. I COULD SEE CONSEQUENCES LATER BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY QUESTIONS ASKED AT THIS TABLE, WELL, WHAT IS THE REASON FOR SUPPORTING THIS KIND OF IMPROVEMENT VERSUS THAT KIND OF IMPROVEMENT, AND THE TRAFFIC STUDY PROVIDES JUST THAT KIND OF BACKGROUND INFORMATION THAT WE ARE OFTEN ASKING FOR AS POLICY MAKERS WHEN WE APPROVE THESE MUCH MORE COSTLY PROJECTS, SO I WON'T, YOU KNOW, REITERATE THE COMMENTS ABOUT INVESTING THESE DOLLARS TO HELP US MAKE WISE DECISIONS, BUT I DO WANT TO ADD THAT BASED ON THE QUESTIONS THAT I HAVE HEARD AROUND THIS TABLE, I THINK THAT THIS COUNCIL OR FUTURE COUNCILS WILL WANT FUTURE INFORMATION FROM THE STUDY WHEN WE LOOK AT HOW TO IMPROVE THE ROADS AND THE TRAFFIC AND TRY TO MITIGATE THAT IN THE AREA, SO I WILL CERTAINLY BE SUPPORTING THIS. IF FOR SOME REASON IT DOESN'T PASS, I JUST ALSO WANT TO EXTEND MY APPRECIATION TO STAFF FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD SO MANY TIMES AND TRYING TO BE RESPONSIVE TO THE REQUEST FROM COUNCIL TO GET THIS DONE.
02:09:58.579: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
02:09:59.480: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME AGAIN TO SPEAK ON THIS TOPIC. I JUST WANT TO ASK AGAIN, MR. HESS, IF I COULD, WE HAVE NOT REMOVED ALL PARTS OF THE PUBLIC INPUT. IT WAS JUST, I THINK, ONE OF FOUR DIFFERENT -- IF I REMEMBER --
02:10:16.964: >> CORRECT, YES, SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DID IN THE FIRST COST REDUCTION TO BRING IT DOWN TO ROUGHLY THE $80,000 REDUCTION WAS TO COMBINE PUBLIC MEETINGS ONE AND TWO, SO, BUT IN ESSENCE, WE STILL HAVE SOLICITING THE SAME FEEDBACK. WE ARE JUST KIND OF COMBINING THOSE TWO PIECES INTO ONE, SO THAT'S SPECIFIC TO THE INITIAL COST REDUCTION, BUT THEN THE OTHER ONES THAT WERE PROPOSED AS PART OF THE MEMO WOULD BE A COMPLETE KIND OF SEPARATION FROM THAT FOR CONSIDERATION.
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
02:12:02.036: >> AS COUNCILMEMBERS ALLUDED TO EARLIER, THERE WOULD PROBABLY BE AN ANNUAL MAINTENANCE OR SUBSCRIPTION FEE FOR WHICHEVER SOFTWARE WE USE FOR MODELING. THOSE CAN RANGE FROM A COUPLE OF THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR ON UP ANNUALLY. WE DO ANTICIPATE HAVING EXPERTISE IN HOUSE TO RUN FUTURE SCENARIOS AND RUN FUTURE MODELING, AND WE DON'T ANTICIPATE IT BEING KIND OF AN ONGOING WE HAVE TO CALL UP THE CONSULTANT EVERY TIME WE WANT TO PUSH THE RUN BUTTON ON THE MODEL. IT'S OUR INTENT TO DEVELOP IT MUTUALLY AND TO GET THE FULL SOFTWARE PACKAGE. IT IS WRITTEN INTO THE CONTRACT THAT WE OWN THE PRODUCT THAT COMES OUT OF THAT, AND THAT IT'S OURS TO KIND OF PLAY WITH, TWEAK WHEN WE HAVE TO, YOU KNOW, DO FUTURE ANALYSIS. WE'LL HAVE THAT CAPABILITY IN HOUSE TO DO THAT.
02:12:50.918: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  AND WHILE WE HAVE YOU, HOW LONG DO YOU BELIEVE THE INFORMATION, THE SOFTWARE THAT WE GET WITH THIS IS GOING TO BE RELEVANT? DO WE EXPECT THIS TO HAVE A FIVE-YEAR SHELF LIFE, 20-YEAR, 50-YEAR?
02:13:09.003: >> THE BEAUTY OF THE SUBSCRIPTION-BASED MODELS NOW, WELL, IT'S GIVE AND TAKE -- IS THOSE SOFTWARE PACKAGES ARE CONSTANTLY UPDATED, SO, A TYPICAL REGIONAL DEMAND MODEL IS CALLED TRANS CAD. THAT'S ONE THING THAT METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION PLANNING DEPARTMENTS USE, SEMCOG AND -- THERE ARE OTHERS THAT WE COULD LOOK AT. WE HAVEN'T SETTLED ON ANYTHING YET. WE ARE STILL WAITING TO SEE WHAT WE ARE DOING HERE, AND ONCE WE GET DIRECTION, WE'LL FIGURE OUT KIND OF WHAT THE NUTS AND BOLTS BEST APPROACH IS MOVING FORWARD, BUT ONCE WE HAVE THE MODEL, IT'S A MODEL THAT'S UPDATED THROUGH SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES. WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO, YOU KNOW, CHANGE THE INPUTS AND MAKE IT RELEVANT. AS NEW DEVELOPMENTS COME ONLINE, WE CAN CHANGE SOME OF THOSE BASELINE SCENARIOS AND ASSUMPTIONS AND DATA TO MAKE SURE IT'S RELEVANT DAY TO DAY, AND SO WE HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY WHEN WE POSSESS THE MODEL AND HAVE IT IN HOUSE AND ARE ABLE TO TINKER WITH IT.
02:14:14.935: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  THANK YOU.
02:14:16.971: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD AND BANISTER.
02:14:20.140: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD:  JUST A QUICK QUESTION. YOU DID MENTION SEMCOG, AND I WAS WONDERING WHY THIS MODELING SOFTWARE IS NOT AVAILABLE THROUGH SEMCOG AND THE OTHER OPTION IS UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE. IT SEEMS LIKE WE ARE SPENDING A LOT OF MONEY SO THAT WE HAVE SORT OF CONTROL OVER SOMETHING THAT MAY BE AVAILABLE TO US IN THE COMMUNITY ALREADY, AND I DON'T KNOW, DOES SEMCOG USE THE SAME MODELING SOFTWARE?
02:14:47.901: >> WELL, IF I COULD, COUNCILMEMBER, DEFER TO THE WASHTENAW AREA TRANSPORTATION STUDY, BECAUSE THEY HAVE A MORE FINITE GRANULAR VERSION OF THE SEMCOG MODEL. MODELS ARE ONLY AS GOOD AS KIND OF THE SCALE AT WHICH YOU WANT TO USE THEM AT. SO, FOR EXAMPLE, A REGIONAL MODEL DOES A TERRIBLE JOB ON AN INTERSECTION BY INTERSECTION ANALYSIS, JUST BECAUSE IT'S MEANT TO BE HIGH LEVEL. IT'S MEANT TO LOOK AT THE NETWORK AS A WHOLE, SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE SEMCOG MODEL, IT JUST DOESN'T HAVE THAT LEVEL OF DETAIL AND GRANULARITY THAT WOULD BE PARTICULARLY VALUABLE TO US WITHOUT A LOT OF REFINEMENT. THAT'S WHAT THE WATTS MODEL COMES IN, AND WE HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN IN DISCUSSION WITH WATTS ABOUT ACCESS TO THEIR MODEL AND ACCESS TO BEING ABLE TO USE THAT AS OUR BASELINE IF WE USE THE SAME SOFTWARE. THAT'S ONE OPPORTUNITY FOR US. I THINK THE QUESTION IS MORE ABOUT THE ABILITY FOR US TO, YOU KNOW, MAKE CHANGES AT THE REQUEST OF, YOU KNOW, THIS COUNCIL OR, YOU KNOW, BASED ON PROJECTS, BASED ON DEVELOPMENT THAT COMES IN, THE ABILITY TO DO THAT IN HOUSE, TO RUN SEVERAL DIFFERENT SCENARIOS IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK COULD BE A VALUABLE RESOURCE IN HOUSE. IF WE ARE AT THE, YOU KNOW, LEISURE OF A DIFFERENT AGENCY, WE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO TURN AROUND THE RESULTS IN THE FASHION THAT COUNCIL MIGHT EXPECT TO SEE THEM, WHEREAS IF WE HAVE THOSE CAPABILITIES IN HOUSE, WE CAN BE AS RESPONSIVE AS POSSIBLE, SO I THINK THAT'S WHERE THE INTENT IS.
02:16:17.591: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER?
02:16:20.094: >> COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER:  I HAD AN ONGOING QUESTION FOR MR. HESS TOO. SO, IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING, OUR ROADS ARE ALREADY BUILT, AND THIS PARTICULAR STUDY IS LOOKING AT PLYMOUTH, BROADWAY, TRAVER, MAIDEN LANE, THAT INTERSECTION THERE. BUT THOSE ROADS ARE ALREADY BUILT. SO, I HAVE SORT OF A TWO-PART QUESTION. WE HAVE GOT EACH DEVELOPMENT, ROXBURY AND MORNINGSIDE AND THE U OF M PARKING STRUCTURES, THEY EACH HAVE TO DO THEIR OWN TRAFFIC STUDY, SO WE HAVE GOT A WHOLE BUNCH OF TRAFFIC STUDIES ALREADY IN E-TRACK IT, PRESUMABLY. WHAT MORE ARE WE EXPECTING TO GET FOR THIS 600,000?
02:17:06.039: >> SO, EACH OF THOSE SITE PLANS AND EACH OF THOSE DEVELOPMENTS IS ONLY LOOKING AT THE IMPACT OF THAT DEVELOPMENT AND IS NOT LOOKING AT THE IMPACT AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL, NOR IS IT LOOKING AT KIND OF REGIONAL MOVEMENT THROUGH THE AREA, SO, YOU KNOW, THIS AREA REPRESENTS KIND OF A CHOKE POINT IN THE CITY, JUST BASED ON KIND OF THE -- YOU KNOW, TO YOUR POINT, THE ROADS ARE ALREADY BUILT OUT. THE BRIDGES ARE PROBABLY MAX YOU HAD OUT TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE. SO WHAT ARE THE OTHER SOLUTIONS THAT WE CAN COME UP WITH? AND I THINK I SAID IN A PREVIOUS MEETING THE SOLUTIONS AREN'T NECESSARILY GOING TO BE EASY. I DON'T ANTICIPATE THAT THIS IS GOING TO SUGGEST WIDENING A BUNCH OF ROADS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. THAT'S A WHOLE 'NOTHER DEBATE ABOUT INDUCED DEMAND AS IT WERE ANYWAY. BUT WE MIGHT BE LOOKING AT THINGS LIKE TRAVEL DEMAND MANAGEMENT. HOW ARE THE WAYS THAT WE CAN KIND OF GET PEOPLE TO MAKE OTHER DECISIONS INSTEAD OF GETTING IN THEIR VEHICLES. ARE THERE INTERSECTION IMPROVEMENTS THAT CAN BE MADE? I CAN'T TELL YOU WHEN OR WHERE OR HOW ON THOSE BECAUSE WE ARE WAITING FOR THE STUDY TO HELP US IDENTIFY THOSE, BUT ARE THERE OPERATIONAL IMPROVEMENTS AT THOSE INTERSECTIONS? ARE THERE RECONFIGURATION OPPORTUNITIES AT SOME OF THOSE INTERSECTIONS TO HELP WITH SOME OF THE TRAFFIC TO GET THROUGH THE INTERSECTION AND TO AND FROM THE DESTINATIONS THAT THEY HOPE TO GO TO? SO, YOU'RE RIGHT, WE LOOK AT AND WE ARE INVOLVED IN EACH OF THOSE DEVELOPMENT REVIEWS AND EACH OF THOSE TRANSPORTATION IMPACT STUDIES AND ANALYSIS, BUT THEY ARE MYOPIC IN NATURE. THEY ARE MEANT TO BE FOCUSED ON A SINGLE PARCEL OR A SINGLE DEVELOPMENT WITH A LITTLE BIT OF SPILLOVER EFFECTS TO THE OTHER AREAS, BUT THEY ARE NOT A SUBREGIONAL PLAN OR ANOTHER PLAN, WHICH THIS IS MEANT TO DO.
02:18:44.571: >> IF I COULD ADD TO THAT, EARLIER THIS EVENING, WE HEARD ABOUT A THIRD -- THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE PATTERNS ON PLYMOUTH ROAD AND ALSO IN OTHER AREAS OF THE CITY AS WELL. THE INITIAL INTENT WAS TO START WITH THE AVENUES OF APPROACH INTO THE AREA AND LOOK TO SEE WHERE TRAFFIC IS GENERATED, NOT JUST WITHIN THE CITY BUT BEYOND THAT, SO WE KNOW WE HAVE AN INTERNAL DRIVER. WE KNOW WE HAVE EXTERNAL DRIVERS. WE KNOW THAT PLYMOUTH ROAD IS THE SMART CORRIDOR FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD, FOR OUR CONNECTED VEHICLE PILOT, WHICH IS FUNDED THROUGH -- IS IN PROGRESS. AS RAYMOND SAID, IT'S MORE DIFFICULT TO TRY AND FIGURE OUT HOW DIFFERENT OPERATIONAL CHANGES ON A PART OF THAT SYSTEM IS GOING TO CAUSE OTHER IMPACTS. YOU KNOW, WE KNOW THAT THE UNIVERSITY IS GOING TO CHANGE THE NATURE OF BOTH THE EAST MEDICAL CAMPUS AND THE MEDICAL CAMPUS DOWNTOWN. THOSE WILL CHANGE COMMUTING PATTERNS, PARKING PATTERNS AS WELL. WE KNOW WE SAW ON THE MAP THAT MS. GOTT PRESENTED TONIGHT A LITTLE DASH LINE THAT'S REMINISCENT OF THE CONNECTOR. THOSE ARE THINGS THAT WILL ALL NEED TO BE MODELED TOGETHER. I THINK RAYMOND IS RIGHT THAT ONE OF THE FRUSTRATIONS THAT YOU HEAR FROM BOTH ADMINISTRATIONS AND COUNCIL IS DIFFERENT DEVELOPMENTS ARE DONE ON A SITE BY SITE BASIS, AND THEY DON'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE IMPACT THAT EACH WILL HAVE ON ANOTHER, SO THIS WILL HELP WITH THAT. TRAFFIC STUDIES ARE A SUBSET OF WHAT'S GOING ON HERE, BUT THIS IS NOT A TRAFFIC STUDY. IT IS A MOBILITY STUDY THAT LOOKS AT SOME OF OUR MOST TROUBLED AND PROMISING CORRIDORS IN THE CITY. THAT WAS THE GENESIS OF WHAT THE COUNCIL ASKED THAT WE PULL THIS TOGETHER. I THINK WE ALL THINK IT IS A BIG PRICE TAG, BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT ALLOWS US TO LEVERAGE ALL OF THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON NOW AND INTO THE FUTURE TO PREVENT US FROM HAVING TRAFFIC BECOME AN EVEN GREATER DEGRADATION TO THE QUALITY OF LIFE AND THE ENVIRONMENT THAN WE SEE NOW.
02:20:45.726: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER, YOU STILL HAVE THE FLOOR.
02:20:48.061: >> COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER: WELL, I JUST -- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'M WONDERING IS IF WE WAITED EVEN THROUGH 2020, WHEN THE DTE LOT AND THE MORNING SIDE PROJECT AND THE COTTAGES AND A WHOLE BUNCH OF THINGS WILL BE BUILT NEXT YEAR, I WONDER IF OUR 600,000 WOULD BE BETTER SPENT IN 2021. WHEN WE THEN -- RATHER THAN SPEND OUR MONEY NOW WHEN WE ARE GOING TO BE CHANGING SO DRAMATICALLY NEXT YEAR.
02:21:23.997: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  MR. HESS?
02:21:25.465: >> WELL, THE ONE THING I'LL SAY IS ANY OF THE PROJECTS WHICH ARE APPROVED WOULD BE FACTORED INTO KIND OF THE BASELINE ASSUMPTIONS OF THE MODEL, SO, WHETHER THEY ARE, YOU KNOW, FULLY OCCUPIED OR FULLY BUILT, THEY WILL BE ASSUMED TO BE SUCH, AS PART OF KIND OF THE UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS OF WHAT GOES INTO THE MODEL. SO, YOU KNOW, IT IS A MODELING EXERCISE, RIGHT? YOU KNOW, THERE'S PROJECTION INVOLVED THERE, BUT I THINK IT IS MEANT TO KIND OF SHED SOME LIGHT ON, YOU KNOW, WHAT THOSE IMPACTS WILL BE AND HOW WE CAN START TO PLAN FOR AND MITIGATE THEM NOW, AS OPPOSED TO WAITING, YOU KNOW, FOR THEIR COMPLETION AND THEN WAITING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THOSE WOULD BE ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS. SO I THINK THAT'S THE INTENT OF WHERE WE ARE COMING FROM, TO TRY TO CATCH UP WITH SOME OF THAT DEVELOPMENT AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT SOME OF THOSE COUNTERMEASURES CAN BE TO HELP WITH CIRCULATION AND ALL MODES OF TRANSPORTATION IN AND AROUND THE AREA.
02:22:25.759: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
02:22:26.626: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER: MR. HESS, I'M SORRY TO HAVE YOU JUMPING UP AND DOWN. THIS WILL BE BRIEF. SO, WHY IS IT -- AND THIS HAS BEEN A LITTLE THING WITH ME, AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE THE RIGHT PERSON OR MR. LAZARUS, BUT WHY IS IT WHEN STAFF ANALYZES THESE PROJECTS AND SITE PLANS THAT COME BEFORE US, THEY ARE NOT ANTICIPATING THIS KIND OF AGGREGATION OF THESE TRAFFIC STUDIES. SO YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT LOWER TOWN DID A STUDY, AND THEY SAY HERE'S WHAT WE ARE GOING TO ADD TO THIS NETWORK, BUT THEY DIDN'T -- AND THOSE NUMBERS WERE NOT ADDED TO THE ONES THAT NORTH SKY ALREADY ADDED OR THE COTTAGES AT PARK GREEN OR WHATEVER ELSE IS GOING ON? IS THAT WHAT I'M HEARING? THAT ANALYSIS ISN'T DONE BEFORE IT COMES TO PLANNING AND THEN TO COUNCIL?
02:23:14.875: >> THOSE ARE. SO, ANYTIME A NEW DEVELOPMENT COMES IN, IT DOES HAVE TO FACTOR IN KIND OF ANY OF THE EXISTING TRAFFIC AND AS WELL AS ANY OF THE ASSUMPTIONS FROM OTHER DEVELOPMENT THAT'S APPROVED. SO THOSE ARE FACTORED IN, BUT, AGAIN, THOSE ARE KIND OF PARCEL BY PARCEL. IT'S NOT A HOLISTIC. IT'S NOT A REGION-WIDE APPROACH. IT'S STILL -- YOU KNOW, QUITE FRANKLY, AS I THINK COUNCIL KNOWS, YOU KNOW, THE IDEA IS TO HELP -- ANYTIME A NEW DEVELOPMENT COMES IN, THE IDEA IS TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT TO THE TRANSPORTATION NETWORK, BY EITHER IMPROVEMENTS ON-SITE OR OFFSITE. TO A CERTAIN EXTENT, THAT'S KIND OF A FIRST-COME, FIRST-SERVE BASIS, SO IF THE NETWORK HAS SOME CAPACITY, LET'S SAY AN INTERSECTION IS OPERATING AT LEVEL OF SERVICE A, AND WE FIND LEVEL OF SERVICE C ACCEPTABLE --
02:24:05.859: >> YEAH, LET ME KNOW WHEN YOU FIND ONE ON NORTH SIDE.
02:24:09.863: >> I THINK THE IDEA WOULD BE THAT THAT DEVELOPMENT STILL CAN HAVE SOME WIGGLE ROOM IN TERMS OF TAKING UP SOME OF THAT CAPACITY, BUT OVER TIME, THAT'S NOT A HOLISTIC APPROACH. THAT'S NOT A REGIONAL APPROACH. THAT DEVELOPMENT IS COMING IN AND MAKING ACCOMMODATIONS THAT SERVE THAT DEVELOPMENT AND NOT NECESSARILY KIND OF THE BIG PICTURE AS A WHOLE, SO THE INPUTS, THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT GO INTO THEIR TRAFFIC IMPACT ANALYSES DO AFFECT OTHER KNOWN GROWTH, BUT AGAIN, IT IS SPECIFIC TO THAT SITE AND NOT NECESSARILY REGIONAL.
02:24:42.362: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER: BECAUSE IT WAS SHOCKING TO ME, IT WAS 10-1, AND I THINK I WAS THE ONE, THAT WE APPROVED THAT DTE MICHCON SITE PLAN OR AREA PLAN RATHER AND REZONING, AND THEY SAID THERE WAS GOING TO BE ZERO IMPACT, NEGLIGIBLE IMPACT THIS GUY STOOD UP HERE AND SAID, AND IT'S NOT TRUE. IT JUST CAN'T BE TRUE. THERE'S NO WAY THEY CAN ADD THAT MANY UNITS AT A SITE WHERE THE BRIDGE IS NOT GOING TO BE WIDENED AND NOT HAVE AN IMPACT. NOW, IS THAT GOING TO BETTER INFORM US TO BE ABLE TO MAKE ZONING DECISIONS IN THE FUTURE? DO YOU THINK THIS WILL BE A VALUABLE TOOL FOR US TO UNDERSTAND THE BUSYNESS THAT WE ARE ADDING TO OUR NETWORK?
02:25:29.676: >> SO, THIS STUDY IS A TRANSPORTATION PLAN IN ITS CORE. IT'S NOT NECESSARILY GOING TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS ON ZONING AND LAND USE, BUT WHAT IT CAN DO, AS PART OF THE SCENARIOS, WE COULD, YOU KNOW, MODEL DIFFERENT TYPES OF DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS AND KIND OF SHOW THE EFFECT OF WHAT THAT WOULD BE ON THE TRANSPORTATION NETWORK. SO, YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT MEANT TO BE A REFERENDUM ON WHAT'S BEEN APPROVED OR WHAT WILL BE APPROVED IN THE LAND USE PART. WE ARE GOING TO STAY IN OUR LANE WHEN IT COMES TO THE TRANSPORTATION PIECE, BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT, YOU KNOW, THOSE INPUTS WILL BE CONSIDERED, AND THERE IS OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT DIFFERENT SCENARIOS RELATED TO LAND USE AND FUTURE GROWTH.
02:26:08.148: >> CITY ADMIN. LAZARUS:  SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S DIFFICULT WHEN A DEVELOPMENT GETS APPROVED IS TO SEE THE IMPACTS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE NETWORK, IN OTHER PARTS OF THE SUB AREA, AND THAT'S I THINK THE FRUSTRATION THAT STEMS FROM THESE, BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE IMPACT, AS RAYMOND SAID, IT'S SITE SPECIFIC, YOU DON'T HAVE A WAY TO LOOK AT THE LARGER IMPACT. BUT A LOT OF THE CHANGES THAT ARE GOING TO COME, WHILE SOME OF THEM -- WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN ON PLYMOUTH ROAD WHEN YOU HAVE GOT MORE STUDENTS UP THERE. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO THE CURRENT SHOPPING CENTERS THAT ARE UP THERE. THERE WILL MOST LIKELY BE CHANGES, BUT THERE ARE ALSO TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES THAT WE ARE ALL GOING TO EXPERIENCE. WE ARE EXPERIENCING THEM NOW IN THEIR INFANCY, AND THEY WILL CONTINUE INTO THE FUTURE, AND THERE'S GOT TO BE A WAY TO INCORPORATE THOSE IMPACTS AS WELL. SO I THINK IT GETS US INTO A POSITION TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SOME GOOD CHOICES ON CAPITAL INVESTMENT, AND IT CAN HELP INFORM OTHER DECISIONS, BUT AS RAYMOND SAID, IT'S NOT A ZONING TOOL, BUT THE IMPACTS OF LAND USE ON TRANSPORTATION --
02:27:11.344: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  I AGREE IT'S NOT A ZONING TOOL, BUT IT SEEMS LIKE MANY OF THE ZONING CONUNDRUMS THAT COME BEFORE US RELATE TO IS IT GOING TO REDUCE QUALITY OF LIFE, SO OBVIOUSLY THEY ARE GOING TO CONNECTED IN MY MIND.
02:27:28.461: >> CITY ADMIN. LAZARUS:  I DON'T KNOW THAT REDUCING THE LEVEL OF SERVICE IN AN INTERSECTION IS ALWAYS A BAD THING, BUT I DO KNOW THAT LOOKING AT THE IMPACT OF MOBILITY ON QUALITY OF LIFE IS A GOOD THING.
02:27:43.576: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
02:27:44.444: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  THIS IS MY SECOND TIME. I DO THINK THAT REDUCING LEVEL OF SERVICE IS NOT A GOOD THING. AND WHY DO I SAY THAT? IT'S BECAUSE EVERY TIME A NEW PROJECT COMES ALONG AND A SEVERAL OF SERVICE IS -- DETERIORATES, WE TYPICALLY HEAR FROM THE FOLKS WHO LIVE IN THAT AREA, AND THEY SHARE THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT THEIR -- YOU KNOW, THEIR ABILITY TO GET IN AND OUT OF THE NEIGHBORHOODS, AND IT DOES -- IT DOES -- YOU KNOW, IT CAUSES -- IN SOME CASES, A LOT OF CASES -- YOU KNOW, WITH CONGESTION COMES IDLING, COMES CO2 EMISSIONS, COMES DELAYED TIMES. THOSE ARE ALL VALID CONCERNS THAT WE HEAR FROM TIME TO TIME TO TIME TO TIME. I WILL SAY THAT I APPRECIATE WHEN I BROUGHT FORTH A PROPOSAL TO DO THE NIXON ROAD CORRIDOR IMPROVEMENT STUDY, THAT WAS ANOTHER CORRIDOR STUDY, AREA STUDY, TRAFFIC STUDY, AND I APPRECIATE THAT FOLKS SUPPORTED IT, AND WHY DID I DO THAT? IT'S BECAUSE WHEN WE WERE APPROVING ALL OF THOSE NEW PROJECTS OUT THAT WAY, RESIDENTS CAME TO THAT PODIUM MANY, MANY, MANY RESIDENTS, AND THE PLANNING COMMISSION AND AT OUR CITY COUNCIL MEETING, AND WHAT WAS THEIR MAJOR CONCERN? THE DIFFICULTY OF GETTING IN AND AROUND THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD, AND IN THIS CASE, IT WAS NIXON ROAD, AND ALSO GREEN ROAD, I HAVE TO SAY, BECAUSE FOLKS OUT THERE ASKED -- I SUBMITTED QUESTIONS TO STAFF ABOUT THAT, AMENDING THAT TO INCLUDE GREEN ROAD BECAUSE OF THE CONGESTION ON GREEN, AND, ANYWAY, WE WEREN'T ABLE TO DO THAT, BUT I WILL JUST SAY THAT STUDY WAS DONE PRIMARILY IN RESPONSE TO ALL OF THE CONCERNS THAT WERE BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION, IN CONCERT WITH APPROVING ALL OF THESE NEW DEVELOPMENTS. I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU ALL -- WE DID EXACTLY THAT. AND SO, SIMILARLY, FOR THIS PART OF TOWN AND THE FIRST WARD, I APPRECIATE THAT YOU LISTED ALL OF THOSE NEW PROJECTS AND DEVELOPMENTS THAT WILL BE COMING ONLINE. COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER AND (SPEECH AWAY FROM MICROPHONE) HAVE TRAFFIC STUDIES, AND THERE'S NO QUESTION TRAFFIC IS GOING TO BE EXACERBATED AND MOBILITY EXACERBATED IN ALL FORMS, AND AGAIN, I -- YOU KNOW, THIS COULD -- I THINK OF POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS THAT A STUDY LIKE THIS COULD PROVIDE, WITH A DETAILED STUDY THAT WE NEED, IS VERY IMPORTANT.
02:30:41.387: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER SMITH.
02:30:48.261: >> CLERK BEAUDRY:  COUNCILMEMBER SMITH?
02:30:49.462: >> COUNCILMEMBER SMITH:  YES.
02:30:50.063: >> CLERK BEAUDRY:  COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
02:30:50.930: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  YES. HAYNER?
02:30:53.800: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  NO.
02:30:54.400: >> CLERK BEAUDRY:  COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER?
02:30:55.301: >> COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER:  NO. GRISWOLD?
02:30:58.371: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD:  NO.
02:30:59.038: >> CLERK BEAUDRY:  COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
02:30:59.872: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  YES. GRAND?
02:31:01.941: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRAND:  YES.
02:31:03.443: >> CLERK BEAUDRY:  COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN?
02:31:04.344: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN:  YES.
02:31:05.612: >> CLERK BEAUDRY:  MAYOR TAYLOR?
02:31:06.246: >> MAYOR TAYLOR: EATON?
02:31:06.879: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  NO.
02:31:08.014: >> CLERK BEAUDRY:  COUNCILMEMBER NELSON?
02:31:08.881: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  YES.
02:31:09.849: >> CLERK BEAUDRY:  THE MOTION CARRIES.
02:31:10.750: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  WE NOW COME TO A SET OF PUBLIC HEARINGS. WE'LL GO THROUGH THE -- PUBLIC HEARINGS ARE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO SPEAK TO COUNCIL ABOUT SPECIFIC ITEMS ON AN AGENDA. TO SPEAK TO THE PUBLIC, YOUR SPEECH MUST RELATE TO THE SPECIFIC SUBJECT ON THE AGENDA. SPEAKERS HAVE THREE MINUTES IN WHICH TO SPEAK, SO PLEASE PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE TIME CLOCK. AS A MATTER OF COURTESY, WE MAY ONLY HAVE ONE PERSON SPEAKING AT A TIME, AND FINALLY, IF YOU REQUIRE ASSISTANCE IN SPEAKING BEFORE COUNCIL TODAY, WE'D BE DELIGHTED TO PROVIDE IT TO YOU. PUBLIC HEARING NUMBER ONE, AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND SECTION 5.15, TABLE 5-15 AND SECTION 5.16.6 OF CHAPTER 55 (UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE) OF TITLE V OF THE CODE OF THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR (OFFICE DISTRICT PERMITTED USES, ACCESSORY RESTAURANT/BAR/FOOD SERVICE USE SPECIFIC STANDARDS) IS THERE ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING?
02:32:06.339: >> HI. MY NAME IS EDWARD. I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO PAGE 1 REGARDING EXPANDING THE OFFICE DISTRICT TO ADD RESTAURANT, BAR AND FOOD SERVICE. I THINK THIS IS AN EXCELLENT IDEA. THERE ARE ANY NUMBER OF CITIES AROUND THE AREA AND AROUND THE WORLD THAT HAVE EMBRACED MIXED ZONING FOR THEIR OFFICE SPACE, WHERE TYPICALLY GROUND FLOORS OR ROOFTOP RESTAURANTS HAVE BEEN POPULAR, AND I DON'T REALLY SEE ANY DOWNSIDE FOR IT IN ANN ARBOR. IT MAY HELP ACTIVATE SOME OF THE OTHER OTHERWISE IDLE OFFICE SPACE AT THE -- CLOSER TO THE FREEWAY AREA. THE RESTAURANT OWNER AND CHEF THAT I SPOKE TO ABOUT THIS DIDN'T HAVE ANY PARTICULAR PLANS, BUT HE WAS INTERESTED IN IT AND THOUGHT THIS MIGHT OPEN UP SOME OPPORTUNITIES. SO, AN UNQUALIFIED YES.
02:33:05.832: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PRELIMINARY HEARING? SEEING NO ONE, THIS PUBLIC HEARING IS CLOSED. PUBLIC HEARING NUMBER TWO, AN AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND SECTION 5.17.4 OF CHAPTER 55 (UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE) OF TITLE V OF THE CODE OF THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR (MIXED USE ZONING DISTRICT DIMENSIONS) (ORDINANCE NO. ORD-19-28) IS THERE ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PRELIMINARY HEARING? SEEING NO ONE, THIS PUBLIC HEARING IS CLOSED. LET'S TAKE A SHORT BREAK. [ GAVEL ] (RECESS TAKEN.) [ GAVEL ]
02:42:55.955: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  WE ARE BACK AFTER A SHORT BREAK. A1, THE REGULAR SESSION MEETING MINUTES OF JULY 2019, MAY I HAVE A MOTION PLEASE PLEASE TO APPROVE THE MINUTES, MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER SMITH, SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM. DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [ CHORUS OF AYES ] ALL OPPOSED? THE MINUTES ARE APPROVED. B1 AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND SECTION 5.15, TABLE 5-15 AND SECTION 5.16.6 OF CHAPTER 55 (UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE) OF TITLE V OF THE CODE OF THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR, MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER SMITH. DISCUSSION OF B1, COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
02:43:37.863: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  JUST BRIEFLY. SO, THESE CHANGES WERE BROUGHT TO US BY SOMEONE WHO OWNS MANY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF SQUARE FEET OF OFFICE SPACE HERE THIS TOWN, AND THAT'S FINE. THE COMMUNITY LIKES TO REACH OUT AND GET THINGS DONE, AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS STAFF LOOSENED IT UP A LITTLE BIT SO THAT IT BENEFITED MORE THAN JUST ONE THIS ONE LANDOWNER, AND SO THAT'S GOOD. THAT'S A GOOD PROGRESSION FROM WHERE IT STARTED. OF COURSE, IT STILL BENEFITS THIS ONE LANDOWNER, AND SO I THINK I SPOKE TO THIS LAST TIME THAT THIS WAS BEFORE US THAT I THINK IT'S TIME WE JOIN THE MANY, MANY -- MOST OTHER CITIES WHO HAVE REGULATIONS ABOUT LOBBYING CITY COUNCIL AND CITY GOVERNMENT, BECAUSE I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT HOW THESE THINGS COME BEFORE US. IT DOESN'T MEAN I DON'T SUPPORT IT. I THINK IT'S AN OKAY IDEA. I THINK OUR REAL NEED IN OFFICE, WHICH ALSO ALLOWS RESIDENTIAL, IS TO LOOSEN UP THE RULES TO ALLOW RESIDENTIAL ACCOMMODATIONS IN THERE ALONG WITH RETAIL AND RESTAURANT TO CREATE MORE OF A MIXED USE AND TO OPEN UP OUR ZONING TO OUR ACTUAL NEEDS AND NOT OUR WANTS, BUT I WOULD GO AHEAD AND SUPPORT THIS, BUT I WAS -- HAD CONCERNS ABOUT ITS ORIGINS.
02:44:49.435: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [ CHORUS OF AYES ] OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. B2 AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND SECTION 5.17.4 OF CHAPTER 55 (UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE) OF TITLE V OF THE CODE OF THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR (MIXED USE ZONING DISTRICT DIMENSIONS) MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN, SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM. DISCUSSION OF B2? ALL IN FAVOR? [ CHORUS OF AYES ] OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. C1, AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND CHAPTER 55 (ZONING), REZONING OF 7.7 ACRES FROM R1E (SINGLE-FAMILY DWELLING DISTRICT) WITH CONDITIONS TO PUD (PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT), WEBER REZONING, 2857 PACKARD ROAD MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN, SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER GRAND. DISCUSSION PLEASE OF C1. COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN?
02:45:42.354: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. THIS PROPERTY HAS BEEN A TOPIC OF CONVERSATION FOR A VERY LONG TIME, TWO-PLUS YEARS, AND THIS IS THE LATEST ITERATION. I WANTED TO JUST SHARE A FEW POINTS OF CONVERSATION FROM THE PLANNING COMMISSION TABLE TO INFORM OUR DISCUSSION HERE. I THINK THERE WERE A FEW IMPORTANT DETAIL-ORIENTED QUESTIONS DISCUSSED, TWO OF WHICH I ACTUALLY WOULD WANT TO FOLLOW UP WITH MR. LENART, JUST AS A HEADS-UP, BUT THEY MOSTLY HAVE TO DO WITH THESE REVISIONS IN THE PLANS CARVE OUT SPACE FOR NATURAL AREA TO BE PRESERVED IN SOME OF THE MOST -- THE OLDEST TREES, THE LARGEST TREES ON SITE, AND THE RESIDENT LANDSCAPE ARCHITECT ON THE PLANNING COMMISSION HAD A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT WOULD THE LONG-TERM MAINTENANCE OF THAT LOOK LIKE, BECAUSE IT REQUIRES A LOT OF CARE OR PERHAPS THE LACK OF CARE IN A LOT OF THE WAYS THAT PEOPLE THINK OF MANICURING LAWNS, AND THE OTHER WAS AROUND PEDESTRIAN CONNECTIVITY, AND THE THIRD BIG TOPIC WAS AROUND THE HISTORIC FARMHOUSE, SO I WANTED TO FOLLOW UP. MR. LENART, CAN YOU REMIND THE BODY WHAT IS INCLUDED, AND IF ANYTHING, WHAT IS CHANGED IN TERMS OF -- IN THE DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT REQUIREMENTS WITH RESPECT TO HOW THE NATURAL AREA WILL BE TREATED?
02:47:12.110: >> CITY PLANNER:  SURE, GOOD EVENING, MAYOR AND COUNCIL. I'M BRETT LENART. I'M THE PLANNING MANAGER. AS PART OF WHAT WAS PROPOSED TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION AND NOW TO CITY COUNCIL FOR YOUR ULTIMATE DETERMINATION WAS A MORE -- HOW THAT HAS BEEN MEMORIALIZED IS IN SPECIFIC REFERENCE IN THE DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT THAT IDENTIFIES AREAS ON THE PLAN OF THE MOST HIGHEST QUALITY WOODLANDS AND OF MOST SIGNIFICANT CONCERN, LARGEST LANDMARK TREES OF CONCERN AND IDENTIFIES A VERY PROACTIVE MANAGEMENT BEYOND WHAT OUR NORMAL ORDINANCE REQUIREMENTS WOULD BE IN THOSE AREAS. IN SUMMARY, THOSE REQUIREMENTS REQUIRE, JUST AS YOU SAID, A VERY NATURALIZED APPROACH, TRYING TO CULTIVATE SOME OF THE NATIVE WOODLANDS THAT ARE ON THAT SITE. THAT MEANS NOT JUST MOWING THOSE AREAS, AS MIGHT HAPPEN IN OTHER DEVELOPMENTS, BUT PROACTIVELY REMOVING INVASIVE SPECIES, EVALUATING THE SUCCESS OF THE REMOVAL OF THOSE INVASIVE SPECIES, AND PARTICULARLY LOOKING FOR THE OPPORTUNITY FOR SOME OF THOSE NEW SEEDLINGS TO REGENERATE IN THOSE NATIVE FOREST FRAGMENTS, IN ADDITION TO, OF COURSE, PRESERVING THE MOST SIGNIFICANT LANDMARK TREES ON THE SITE AS WELL.
02:48:31.890: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN:  AND ALL OF THAT NOW CODIFIED IN THE DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT?
02:48:36.662: >> CITY PLANNER:  CORRECT.
02:48:38.330: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN:  AND THAT'S WITH N.A.P. PROVIDING SUPERVISION AND OVERSIGHT?
02:48:43.535: >> YEAH, AS N.A.P. HAS A LOT OF EXPERTISE IN THE AREA OF NATURAL FEATURES, WE FELT THAT WAS APPROPRIATE. WE LOOK TO THEM TO CRAFT THE REQUIREMENTS AND EXPECTATIONS. THAT LANGUAGE ALSO ALLOWS THAT -- REQUIRES, IN FACT, THE SUBMISSION OF THAT PLAN TO BE REVIEWED ON A REGULAR BASIS. IT ALSO REQUIRES THAT RESPONSIBILITY TO CARRY FORWARD FROM THE DEVELOPER DURING THE DURATION OF DEVELOPMENT TO A HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION AFTER ANY DEVELOPMENT IS REALIZED.
02:49:07.993: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN: OKAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU, MR. LENART. THAT'S THE UPDATE I WAS LOOKING FOR. IN TERMS OF THE -- THIS IS A P.U.D., AND, YOU KNOW, CONVERSATION OF PUBLIC BENEFIT HAS TO ENSUE AS A RESULT. THE PETITIONER HAS ARTICULATED THE PUBLIC BENEFITS AS BEING SOME ADDITIONAL FLOOD WATER MITIGATION AS WATER MOVES FROM EASY STREET THROUGH THE SITE TO THE EAST, AS WELL AS THE PROTECTION OF THE NATURAL AREAS. CONVERSATION AT THE PLANNING COMMISSION ALSO CHANNELED IN ON TRYING TO GET THE DEVELOPER TO INVEST IN SUSTAINABLE INFRASTRUCTURE ON THINGS THAT WOULD ALLOW HOMES TO MORE READILY PUT E.V. CHARGING UNITS IN, FOR EXAMPLE, FOR AUTOMOBILES, WHICH WASN'T PARTICULARLY FRUITFUL. THIS SITE OBVIOUSLY HAS A LOT OF COMPLEX FACTORS AND VARIABLES AT PLAY, AND I WOULD WELCOME COLLEAGUES' DISCUSSION. OBVIOUSLY THIS IS THE FIRST READING.
02:50:26.872: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER AND THEN LUMM.
02:50:28.039: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  THANK YOU. I'M JUST TRYING TO GET MY HEAD AROUND THESE NUMBERS ON PAGE 3 OF THE TREE PRESERVATION, BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST CONCERNS HERE WITH THE BODY, IS THESE TREES. AND SO DO I HAVE IT CORRECT THAT THEY ARE GOING FROM -- WITH THIS P.U.D. THAT'S BEING PROPOSED, WHICH IS SOMEWHAT BETTER, RIGHT, THERE ARE SOME PUBLIC BENEFITS, ALTHOUGH ON THE WHOLE, I STILL THINK IT'S KIND OF TRAGIC. THEY ARE GOING FROM 208 WOODLAND TREES TO 62, AND THEY ARE GOING FROM 57 LANDMARK TREES TO 19, IS WHAT I'M SEEING HERE, AND SO THAT'S, WHAT, 200 AND SOME TREES BEING REMOVED. SO, I KNOW I HAVE ASKED THIS QUESTION BEFORE. MR. LENART, MAYBE YOU CAN HELP ME OUT WITH THIS. THE CITY MARKS THESE LANDMARK TREES AND WE TAG THESE TREES, SO ANY TREES I SEE OUT ON A PRIVATE PROPERTY SOMEWHERE THAT HAVE THAT RING ON IT AND A COUNT NUMBER, IS THAT CONSIDERED A LANDMARK TREE?
02:51:30.669: >> NO. WHAT YOU'RE PROBABLY SEEING IS A SURVEY INDICATION. WHEN A SITE PLAN IS SUBMITTED FOR THE CITY, THE DEVELOPER IS REQUIRED TO IDENTIFY AND SURVEY ALL OF THE WOODLANDS AND TREES ON THAT SITE. THAT IS USUALLY A CONVENTION THAT THEY ARE DOING TO CORRESPOND THAT PHYSICAL TREE TO A LOCATION ON THE SITE AND DATE ASSOCIATED. THAT IS SUCH AS A SPECIES AND THE SIZE OR CALIPER OF THAT TREE AND THE CONDITION OF THAT TREE. THAT IS REFLECTED ULTIMATELY IN A NATURAL FEATURES SURVEY, WHICH IS PART OF THE CITY'S EVALUATION --
02:52:01.466: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  THAT'S WHEN YOU SEE ON THE SITE PLANS THE TREE LOG OR WHATEVER THE EXPRESSION IS FOR THAT?
02:52:11.443: >> CITY PLANNER:  (SIMULTANEOUS SPEECH) EXACTLY.
02:52:12.944: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  DOES THE CITY KEEP A RECORD OF ITS LANDMARK TREES?
02:52:16.648: >> WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE LANDMARK TREES OR WOODLANDS BASED ON THE DENSITY OF THE TREES IN A DEFINED AREA, AT A CERTAIN DENSITY THE SPECIES TYPES OF THOSE TREES, AND THE LANDMARK ORDINANCE SPECIFIES THE TYPES OF TREES AND THE CALIPER DIMENSION. IF THE TREE IS THAT SPECIES, THAT SIZE OR GREATER, IT IS A LANDMARK TREE. IF IT IS NOT THAT SIZE, IT IS NOT A LANDMARK TREE. IT MIGHT FALL INTO THE WOODLAND CATEGORY, WHICH IS AN ASSEMBLAGE OR DENSITY OF TREES.
02:52:50.015: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  SO THE CITY DOESN'T HAVE A MASTER LIST OF TREES IS WHAT YOU ARE SAYING?
02:52:55.186: >> WE HAVE A MASTER LIST OF CRITERIA, MEASUREMENTS DEFINING A LANDMARK TREE, AND WE REQUIRE A CERTAIN REGULATION OR MITIGATION OF THAT IF IT IS IMPACTED.
02:53:07.165: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  AND THE REGULATION OR MITIGATION IN THE FUTURE, THAT'S UP TO US, WITHIN THE PARAMETERS OF THE STATE ENABLING CLAUSE?
02:53:15.373: >> CITY PLANNER:  THAT MITIGATION IS UP TO YOU AND THE U.D.C. ZONING STANDARDS THAT YOU SPECIFY WHEN SUCH A TREE IS IMPACTED, WHAT IS THE IMPACT TO THAT DEVELOPMENT.
02:53:25.517: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  OKAY. I THINK THAT THIS IS -- WE HAVE LIKE A 60-INCH OAK ON THIS SITE AND SOME THINGS LIKE THAT. THESE ARE SOME OF THE 250-300-YEAR-OLD TREES HERE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT, RIGHT? OKAY. THAT IS PRETTY SAD, AND I KNOW THAT WE ARE KIND OF WEIGHING THESE TWO THINGS BECAUSE OF THE BY RIGHT NATURE OF THIS PROJECT, BUT IT'S A HARD YES FOR SOMEBODY TO SAY YES TO THIS, I HAVE GOT TO TELL YOU, SOMEBODY WHO LOVES TREES, AND I WOULD ALSO ENCOURAGE US TO COME UP WITH SOME LEGISLATION THAT DOES MORE TO PROTECT OUR LANDMARK TREES. THANK YOU.
02:54:01.820: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
02:54:02.721: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I WILL JUST SAY I HAVE MIXED FEELINGS ON THIS PROPOSAL RIGHT NOW. COUNCIL HAS UNANIMOUSLY DENIED THE PREVIOUS PROPOSAL, AND I FELT THAT THAT WAS WHOLLY APPROPRIATE. THE NATURAL FEATURES IMPACTS OF THE PRIOR PLANS WERE DEVASTATING AND UNNECESSARY. AND I THINK THE FACT THAT A REVISED VIABLE PLAN HAS SURFACED WITH THE SAME NUMBER OF UNITS AND SIGNIFICANTLY LESS NATURAL FEATURES DAMAGED CLEARLY DEMONSTRATES THE ORIGINAL PLANNED PROPOSAL WASN'T ANYWHERE NEAR OPTIMAL AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN DENIED, SO MY TAKE IS THAT THIS PLAN IS AN IMPROVEMENT, AND IT DOES SEEM THE DEVELOPER HAS MADE A GOOD-FAITH EFFORT TO MITIGATE THE ADVERSE NATURAL FEATURES IMPACTS, BUT THERE ARE STILL CONCERNS, AS YOU CAN HEAR. WE HIT PAUSE ON THE LITIGATION IN FEBRUARY, WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THE DEVELOPER WOULD COME BACK WITH A REVISED PROJECT UNDER P.U.D. ZONING, AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED, SO IT IS OUR CALL NOW WHETHER THE IMPROVEMENTS ARE SUFFICIENT AND WHETHER THE PUBLIC BENEFITS JUSTIFY THE REZONING AND APPROVAL OF THE PLAN. STAFF AND THE PLANNING COMMISSION THINK SO AND HAVE CHANGED A RECOMMENDATION FROM DENIAL TO APPROVAL. I'M NOT SO SURE, AND I'M ALSO INTERESTED IN HEARING COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN'S THOUGHTS ON WHY HE VOTED AGAINST THIS REVISED PROPOSAL. THE POSITIVES OF THIS PROJECT, IN MY VIEW, INCLUDE THE ADDED 50 UNITS OF HOUSING AND THE IMPROVED MANAGEMENT OF STORMWATER RUNOFF FROM NEIGHBORING PROPERTIES. THIS DEVELOPMENT DOES REFLECT A LARGE PROPORTION OF OPEN SPACE, 50%, AND BY RELOCATING THE BUILDINGS, THE NATURAL FEATURES IMPACTS ARE LESS SEVERE. THE ORIGINAL PLAN WAS DENIED ESSENTIALLY BECAUSE IT REMOVED ALL OF THE HIGH QUALITY FEATURES. WHILE THIS PLAN DOES RETAIN A LARGE PORTION OF OPEN SPACE, 54%, BY RELOCATING THE BUILDINGS, THE NATURAL IMPACTS FEATURES ARE LESS SEVERE. THE ORIGINAL PLAN THAT WAS DENIED ESSENTIALLY REMOVED, AGAIN, ALL OF THE HIGH-QUALITY NATURAL FEATURES. THIS PLAN RETAINS HIGH-QUALITY FEATURES, INCLUDING PROTECTING ABOUT 40 MORE TREES, AND KEEPING LANDMARK TREES -- BUT THAT IS NOT TO SAY THAT THE NATURAL FEATURES IMPACTS ARE NOT SIGNIFICANT. THEY ARE. THE NEW PLAN STILL RESULTS IN THE REMOVAL OF 146 WOODLAND TREES AND 38 LANDMARK TREES, WHICH IS ENOUGH THAT THE AREA NO LONGER MEETS THE DEFINITION OF A, YOU KNOW, QUOTE "WOODLAND," AND OTHER CONCERNS RELATE TO THE COMPATIBILITY OF THE EXISTING NEIGHBORHOOD AND TRAFFIC. THE DEVELOPER HELD TWO PUBLIC INFORMATION SESSIONS AND BOTH WERE WELL INTENDED, AND THAT IS NOT SURPRISING, BECAUSE THIS WOULD REPRESENT A DRAMATIC CHANGE ON THE PARCEL, WHICH IS ALMOST EIGHT ACRES IN AN EXISTING NEIGHBORHOOD, SO CLEARLY THIS WOULD CHANGE THE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD, BUT UNLIKE SOME PROPOSALS THAT WE HAVE SEEN THAT WOULD OVERWHELM THE NEIGHBORHOOD WITH THEIR MASS AND HEIGHT, THAT IS NOT THE CASE HERE. THE SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS ON DENSITY, HAVING SEVEN UNITS AN ACRE AND A HOME SIZE OF 2000 SQUARE FEET, THAT WILL RESULT IN UNITS WHICH ARE MORE CONSISTENT WITH THE SURROUNDING NEIGHBORHOODS THAN WE HAVE SEEN WITH OTHER DEVELOPMENT PROPOSALS, FRANKLY, SO I TOO AM INTERESTED IN HEARING WHAT OTHER COLLEAGUES HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THIS REVISED PROPOSAL. I'M ALSO VERY INTERESTED IN HEARING MORE FROM THE NEIGHBORS, AND FOR THAT REASON I AM INCLINED TO SUPPORT THIS AT FIRST READING SO THAT WE CAN CONDUCT A PUBLIC HEARING TO HEAR FROM NEIGHBORS AND OTHERS. SO, THANK YOU.
02:58:02.727: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
02:58:04.429: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  THANK YOU. I WILL RELUCTANTLY SUPPORT THIS PLAN. WE ARE FACED WITH TWO BAD CHOICES. THOSE CHOICES ARE THE CONSEQUENCE OF THE DECISION COUNCIL MADE SOMETIME AGO TO REZONE THIS PARTIAL PROPERTY TO R1E. THE DENSITY ALLOWED IN AN R1E ZONING DISTRICT FORESEEABLY THREATENED THE MANY TREES THAT ARE ON THIS PARCEL OR PROPERTY. THIS PLAN, IN ITS CURRENT FORM, PROTECTS MORE TREES THAN THE PREVIOUS PLAN THAT WE REJECTED, BUT THE PROTECTION OF THOSE TREES IS A MINOR MITIGATION OF THE HARM THAT WAS DONE WHEN WE VOTED TO REZONE THIS TO R1E. I VOTED AGAINST THAT ZONING. DENSITY HAS AN IMPACT ON NATURAL FEATURES, AND WHEN YOU GO INTO A NEIGHBORHOOD LIKE THIS, OR ESPECIALLY A PROPERTY LIKE THIS, AND YOU PROSCRIBE ADDITIONAL DENSITY, THE PRICE YOU PAY IS LOSING THE NATURAL FEATURES THAT EXIST ON THE PROPERTY.
02:59:32.717: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
02:59:35.420: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRAND:  THANK YOU. YOU KNOW, AS A -- AS YOU KNOW, THIS PROPERTY SITS IN MY WARD, AND I HAVE HEARD A LOT FROM NEIGHBORS, AND I'LL TRY TO SPEAK REALISTICALLY ABOUT WHAT COULD HAPPEN IF WE DON'T MOVE FORWARD WITH DEVELOPMENT. I DON'T NECESSARILY AGREE THAT REZONING TO R1E WAS A MISTAKE. THE DEVELOPER COULD EASILY UNDER THE PAST ZONING GONE IN AND CLEAR CUT THE WHOLE THING AND THEN BUILT McMANSIONS, SO I DON'T THINK THAT'S REALLY -- I THOUGHT R1E FOR A FEW EXTRA UNITS AND TO KEEP THE UNITS AT A MAXIMUM OF 2,000 SQUARE FEET WAS THE MOST REASONABLE COMPROMISE, AND WHEN THE NATURAL FEATURES WERE NOT IN COMPLIANCE, I VOTED WITH THE REST OF COUNCIL TO DENY THIS DEVELOPMENT. I REALLY THINK THAT THAT COMPROMISE WAS THE BEST IN ADDRESSING THE NEIGHBORS' CONCERNS ABOUT THE SIZE OF THE SURROUNDING HOUSES AND THAT THIS WAS THE BEST PLAN TO TRY TO MATCH THAT CONCERN. WHAT I HAVE HEARD TIME AND TIME AGAIN FROM NEIGHBORS IS THE IMPORTANCE OF THE NATURAL FEATURES ON THE SITE. I THINK THAT'S PARAMOUNT IN MAKING THIS DECISION, AND THAT'S WHY I CERTAINLY INTEND TO SUPPORT IT TONIGHT. BUT I DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS HAS BEEN A DIFFICULT PROCESS. WHEN WE DID INITIALLY SUPPORT THE R1E BASED ON AREA PLAN THAT SHOWED MORE TREES AND THEN WERE PRESENTED WITH A SITE PLAN THAT TOOK AWAY A NUMBER OF THE TREES, THAT DEFINITELY LEFT A SOUR TASTE IN MY MOUTH, AND I THINK COUNCIL ACTED ACCORDINGLY, AND I THINK THERE ARE STILL FEELINGS THAT EXIST BECAUSE OF THAT PROCESS, SO IT -- IT HASN'T BEEN THE WAY THAT WE NECESSARILY WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS GO DOWN, BUT I THINK ALL IN ALL, THIS WILL PROVIDE SOME MUCH-NEEDED HOUSING AT A SIZE THAT DOESN'T OVERWHELM THE NEIGHBORHOOD. I THINK THAT THE MOST DENSE HOUSING, I LIKE THAT IT'S IN THE CENTER OF THIS DEVELOPMENT, SO IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO NECESSARILY BE SEEN. YOU'LL REALLY SEE THE SINGLE-FAMILY HOMES ON THE OUTSIDE, AND MANY OF THEM WILL BE ONE STORY, SO, YOU KNOW, I UNDERSTAND AND CERTAINLY DO SYMPATHIZE WITH THE NEIGHBORS' CONCERNS AND UNDERSTAND THE FRUSTRATIONS WITH THE PROCESS BUT DO INTEND TO VOTE FOR THIS THIS EVENING.
03:02:14.212: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER AND THEN ACKERMAN.
03:02:17.782: >> COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER: WELL, AS A MEMBER OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION AND ALSO ON THE NATURAL FEATURES SUBCOMMITTEE, WE TALK A LOT ABOUT THE VALUE OF TREES AND THE NEW ORDINANCES WE ARE TRYING TO GET IN PLACE TO PROTECT THE TREES, BECAUSE IN LIGHT OF CLIMATE CHANGE, WE REALLY NEED ALL OF OUR TREES OF THESE TYPE INSIDE THE CITY, AND I BELIEVE THAT IS WHAT THE RESIDENTS ALSO SUPPORT. THE CITY HAS -- IN SURVEYS, WE ALWAYS LIKE OUR PARKS AND OUR TREES, AND WE NEVER TURN DOWN PARK MILLAGES, SO ONE OF MY BIG QUESTIONS THAT HAS BEEN CIRCULATING, AND FOR SOME ODD REASON, WE CAN'T GET A CONCLUSIVE ANSWER, IS THE GREENBELT MILLAGE, ONE THIRD OF THOSE FUNDS, AND IT HAS ACCUMULATED SOMEWHERE AROUND $6 MILLION FOR USE OF SPECIAL PROPERTIES, SUCH AS THIS ONE, TO BUY THESE SPECIAL PROPERTIES WITHIN THE CITY LIMITS. THAT WAS IN THE ORIGINAL GREENBELT MILLAGE. THERE'S $6 MILLION ACCUMULATED IN THERE, AND I MYSELF AND THE DIFFERENT RESIDENTS WHO HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS FOR MONTHS, WE CAN'T SEEM TO GET A STRAIGHT ANSWER ON WHERE -- WHY THAT $6 MILLION OF GREENBELT MONEY TO BE USED WITHIN THE CITY IS NOT BEING DISCUSSED MORE ACTIVELY IN REGARDS TO OFFERING TO BUY SOME OR ALL OF THIS PARCEL. IS THERE ANYONE ON CITY STAFF WHO IS PREPARED TO ILLUMINATE COUNCIL ON THAT $6 MILLION OF GREENBELT MONEY FOR USE IN THE CITY?
03:04:22.473: >> CITY ADMIN. LAZARUS: COUNCILMEMBER, THAT ITEM IS NOT POSTED. WE DON'T HAVE STAFF HERE TO DISCUSS IT.
03:04:28.512: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER GRAND SITS ON THE GREENBELT COMMISSION. PERHAPS --
03:04:31.315: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRAND:  THANK YOU. I HAVE BEEN THE LIAISON AND A MEMBER OF THE PARK ADVISORY COMMISSION FOR 11 YEARS. I HAVE SPENT PLENTY OF TIME TALKING ABOUT LAND ACQUISITION IN THE CITY AND HAVE ALSO BEEN ON THE GREENBELT FOR FIVE. SO THE PARKS PORTION IN THE CITY GREENBELT WAS NEVER MEANT TO BE USED TO PREVENT DEVELOPMENT. IT WAS MEANT TO BE USED TO IMPROVE THE PARKS SYSTEM. THIS PIECE OF LAND IS CLOSE TO A NUMBER OF CITY PARKS, INCLUDING BOROUGH PARK, SO THERE IS A NUMBER OF CRITERIA USED WHEN SELECTING PARKS, INCLUDING THINGS LIKE DOES IT PROVIDE ACCESS TO AN EXISTING PARK, IS IT LAND ALONG THE RIVER, DOES IT IMPROVE MOBILITY, DOES IT IMPROVE CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN PARKS, SO, THOSE ARE JUST SOME EXAMPLES THERE. IT'S MUCH MORE IN-DEPTH THAN THAT. SO, SO IN ADDITION, MONEY FROM THE GREENBELT CAN BE USED TO PURCHASE LAND, BUT IT CAN'T BE USED TO MAINTAIN PARKS, SO THE PARK ADVISORY COMMISSION THEN AND LAND ACQUISITION COMMISSION, WHICH IS A SUBCOMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE OF THE PARK ADVISORY COMMISSION, HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN VERY JUDICIOUS IN TERMS OF THE LAND THAT IT CHOOSES TO BUY, BECAUSE THE PARKS MILLAGE DOES NOT INCREASE TO MAINTAIN THAT LAND. ALSO, HISTORICALLY, IN TERMS OF BUYING LAND, IT TYPICALLY COMES FROM THE LANDOWNER REQUESTING THAT THAT LAND COME INTO THE GREENBELT OR COME INTO THE PARKS SYSTEM, SO THAT HASN'T BEEN THE PROCESS IN WHICH IT HAS WORKED, BUT MOSTLY, YOU KNOW, THIS LAND HAS NOT BEEN DESIRED BY THE PARK ADVISORY COMMISSION. WHILE I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK FOR THE COMMISSION AS A WHOLE, TYPICALLY BECAUSE IT DOESN'T MEET THE CRITERIA, THAT PART OF THE CITY IS SURROUNDED BY PARKLAND, AND WE WANT TO USE THE MONEY TO MAINTAIN THE PARKS THAT WE HAVE, BECAUSE WE ARE ALREADY -- YOU KNOW, AS WE KNOW, VERY STRETCHED THIN. I ALSO JUST WANT TO COMMENT ON A COMMENT THAT YOU MADE, COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER, ABOUT TREES AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT. WHILE WE CERTAINLY VALUE TREES IN THE CITY, HOUSING CLOSE TO WHERE PEOPLE WORK IS ALSO KNOWN TO REDUCE CARBON EMISSIONS AND IS AN IMPORTANT -- YOU KNOW, MOST ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF RELATIVELY DENSE HOUSING WITHIN URBAN CORES FOR THAT REASON. SO, AGAIN, WHILE I HAVE A LOT OF EMPATHY FOR THE PROCESS AND FOR THE NEIGHBORS IN THAT REGARD, I THINK THAT ENVIRONMENTAL ARGUMENT FALLS SHORT IN THIS CASE.
03:07:29.460: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN?
03:07:33.731: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN:  I DON'T KNOW IF COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER IS FIRST.
03:07:36.500: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  I'M SORRY. THANK YOU.
03:07:39.136: >> COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER: THANK YOU FOR THAT DETAILED EXPLANATION OF HOW THINGS HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY, BUT I REMAIN COMMITTED THAT THIS IS 2019. CLIMATE CHANGE IS COMING FAST AND FASTER THAN EVER, AND THIS 7.7 ACRES WITH ITS LANDMARK TREES AND WOODLAND IS IRREPLACEABLE. IT'S ONE OF ONLY A COUPLE OF PROPERTIES IN THE CITY THAT I WOULD CONSIDER USING THE GREENBELT MONEY FOR, AND THE GREENBELT MONEY HAS NOT BEEN USED. WE ARE SAVING IT. WE ARE SITTING ON, I BELIEVE, $6 MILLION, SO, TO ME, IN MY VIEW, WHICH IS A HIGH-PRIORITY USE TO WORK CREATIVELY TO USE THAT -- A SMALL PORTION OF THAT 6 MILLION IN THIS INSTANCE. THANK YOU.
03:08:27.985: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN?
03:08:29.553: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR, AND THANK YOU TO COLLEAGUES FOR THE CONVERSATION AND MR. LENART FOR YOUR SUPPORT. I JUST WANTED TO QUICKLY RESPOND TO COUNCILMEMBER LUMM'S QUESTION DIRECTLY ABOUT MY LONE NO VOTE AT THE PLANNING COMMISSION. THAT SPAWNED FROM A CONVERSATION WE HAD REALLY EARLY IN THIS P.U.D. PROCESS. AGAIN, THE LATEST ITERATION, I HAD SOME TECHNICAL QUESTIONS OR ISSUES ABOUT WHAT MY ROLE WAS, GIVEN THAT WE WERE, YOU KNOW, SHORTLY BEFORE PARTY TO LITIGATION, AND I'M ALSO A COUNCILMEMBER, AND IT WAS COMPLICATED AND AWKWARD, AND STAFF GAVE ME THE WISE ADVICE THAT FOR THE SAKE OF PLANNING COMMISSION, MY CONSIDERATION AND VOTE SHOULD BE ON WHETHER OR NOT THIS MEETS THE STANDARD OF A P.U.D. AND IS IT SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD PASS AS A P.U.D., AND THE BENEFIT OF THE STORMWATER AND THIS AMOUNT OF PRESERVED NATURAL FEATURES IN MOST OTHER CONTEXTS WOULDN'T STAND THAT TEST, LIKELY, AND THAT WAS MY CONSIDERATION. AS A PLANNING COMMISSIONER. WE NOW MOVE TO COUNCIL, AND THE CALCULUS BECOMES HARDER, BECAUSE NOW AS COUNCILMEMBERS, WE HAVE TO ASSESS THE ENVIRONMENTAL RISK OF WHAT A CLEARCUT OF THIS LAND WOULD MEAN PRIOR TO ANY PROPOSAL BEING PASSED. WE HAVE TO CALCULATE THE RISK OF WHAT EXTENDED LITIGATION MEANS, RIGHT? AND THE CALCULUS IS HARDER AT THIS TABLE, AND I DO APPRECIATE THE SENTIMENT THAT I THINK VOTING THIS THROUGH TONIGHT TO ALLOW FOR A PUBLIC HEARING WOULD BE VERY BENEFICIAL FOR EVERYONE INVOLVED. ONE LAST REQUEST OF THE PETITIONER, IF THIS IS TO MOVE FORWARD, I THINK WHAT WOULD MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE IS THE CONVERSATION AROUND THE FARMHOUSE, AND I REALIZE THAT THE PROPERTY IS NOT YET IN YOUR HANDS, BUT THE ABILITY FOR LOCAL RESIDENTS AND LOCAL HISTORIANS TO GET INTO IT AND DOCUMENT IT, TAKE PICTURES, FIGURE OUT WHAT A FAIR PURCHASE PRICE WOULD BE IN PUTTING TOGETHER A PROACTIVE PLAN FOR MOVING IT WITH PRIVATE DOLLARS, IF THEY ARE ABLE TO, WOULD GO A LONG WAY, AND IF THIS PASSES TONIGHT, YOU WOULD HAVE A MONTH UNTIL OCTOBER 7TH TO HELP US MAKE FORWARD MOVEMENT ON THAT, AND I THINK THAT WOULD MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE. AND I'M GOING TO SOUND LIKE A BIG TREE HUGGER, BUT YOU HAVE PROBABLY HEARD ALL OF MY TREE HUGGER LINES OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS, SO ANOTHER IMPORTANT PIECE WITH LOCAL RESIDENTS BEING ABLE TO COLLECT, IF POSSIBLE, ANY ACORNS ON SITE. THESE ARE TREES THAT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SURVIVE FOR OVER 200 YEARS, AND THAT MEANS THEY PROBABLY HAVE PRETTY GOOD GENES, AND IT WOULD BE GREAT TO BE ABLE TO GRAB SOME OF THOSE AND MOVE THEM, ONLY, AGAIN, IF POSSIBLE. SO, SEEING MOVEMENT IN THOSE TWO AREAS WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL. IF THIS PASSES, YOU WOULD HAVE UNTIL OCTOBER 7TH TO HELP US A LITTLE BIT, BUT I THINK A PUBLIC HEARING WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL ON THIS TOPIC, SO I'M INCLINED TO SUPPORT IT AT FIRST READING.
03:11:44.581: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
03:11:46.116: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN FOR THOSE REMARKS. I'LL SUPPORT THIS TO A PUBLIC HEARING. I DON'T LIKE IT. THE FACT THAT IT CAME BACK AS A P.U.D. AND IS SO MUCH BETTER, EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT GREAT, IT'S STILL SO MUCH BETTER THAN THAN THE R1E THAT WAS SITTING OUT THERE, AND WE ARE SEEING R1E UP AT NORTH SKY, AND IT'S A DOG, MAN. IT'S NOT A GOOD ZONING DESIGNATION FOR THIS CITY. I WANT TO TAKE R1E BACK AND MAKE IT EB ENVIRONMENTAL. THESE HOUSES TEN FEET APART FROM EACH OTHER, IT'S A WASTE, IT'S A WASTE OF GOOD URBAN SPACE, AND SO WE NEED TO GET THIS PUSHED BACK TO PLANNING AND MAKE THIS R1E OR AT LEAST MODIFY IT SO IT'S BETTER. THIS SHOWS HOW RADICALLY BETTER IT CAN BE WHEN IT'S NOT THAT. TO BE HONEST, I DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT CRAWLED UP OUT OF, THE R1E. I KNOW IT WAS AN EFFORT TO REDUCE THE LOT SIZE, THE TOTAL BUILDING ENVELOPE, WHICH IS AN ENVIRONMENTAL EFFORT AND I APPRECIATE IT, BUT THE FACT THAT WE HAVE THESE MICROLOTS WITH THESE THINGS AND NOW THERE'S A BUNCH OF HOUSES EIGHT FEET APART, IT'S CRAZY. PUSH THEM TOGETHER. AND THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE DOING WITH THE P.U.D. IT'S NOT GREAT YET, BUT IT'S DEFINITELY WORTH A PUBLIC HEARING.
03:13:01.992: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
03:13:03.260: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  I JUST WANTED TO THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN, FOR THAT EXPLANATION. IT IS VERY HELPFUL. AND YOU'RE CERTAINLY RIGHT, IT IS VERY COMPLICATED. THANK YOU. AND I ALSO APPRECIATE THAT YOU BROUGHT UP THIS CONCERN ABOUT THE HOUSE ON THE PROPERTY, AND I WANT TO THANK STAFF FOR THEIR RESPONSE TO A QUESTION ABOUT THAT, AND IN THE RESPONSE -- AND I REFERENCED THE COVER MEMO STATEMENT, WHEREIN IT SAYS THE SITE PLAN IS CONTINGENT, QUOTE, "EXISTING HOUSE ON THE SITE REMAINING UNTIL THE GRADING PERMIT IS APPROVED TO ALLOW ADDITIONAL TIME TO EXPLORE MOVING THIS HOUSE," AND THEN STAFF IN RESPONSE TO THE QUESTION ASKING WHAT'S BEING CONSIDERED, IN TERMS OF MOVING THE HOUSE. I APPRECIATE THAT THE PETITIONER DID AGREE AT THE PLANNING COMMISSION MEETING NOT TO DEMOLISH THE HOUSE UNTIL SAID STATED PERMITS FOR CONSTRUCTION WERE ISSUED, AND STAFF WENT ON TO SAY THE INTENTION OF THIS PROVISION IS TO PROVIDE FOR NEIGHBORS AND/OR OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES TO EXPLORE THE POSSIBILITIES FOR FUNDING OR CONDUCTING SUCH WORK. I WILL JUST SAY, BECAUSE THE PETITIONER IS HERE, THAT WE HAVE HEARD FROM FOLKS IN THE COMMUNITY WHO ARE ADVOCATING STRONGLY THAT WE ENCOURAGE THE PERMISSION TO -- PETITIONER TO WORK WITH CITIZENS AND THE CITY ABOUT INNOVATIVE WAYS TO SAY THE HOUSE. I'M QUOTING FROM A LETTER THAT WE GOT TODAY -- TO SAVE THE HOUSE FROM DEMOLITION, AND SO I'M HOPEFUL THAT THOSE TALKS ARE PURSUED, AND THAT A PROPOSAL COULD COME FORWARD TO -- AS THIS PERSON WROTE, TO GIVE THIS HISTORIC HOUSE A FUTURE. SO, THANKS.
03:15:02.713: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [ CHORUS OF AYES ] OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. DC1, RESOLUTION TO APPOINT JAMES SUMMERS TO THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER SMITH, SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER -- SOMEONE -- GRAND, THANK YOU. FURTHER DISCUSSION OF DC1? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
03:15:28.438: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  JUST REAL QUICKLY, SO THIS IS JAMES SUMMERS, THE HUMAN ELECTRIC VEHICLE GUY, RIGHT?
03:15:37.514: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  CORRECT.
03:15:38.649: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  AND HE LIVES IN YPSI, IS THAT CORRECT?
03:15:46.523: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  CORRECT.
03:15:47.624: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  IS IT ALL BIKE PEOPLE ON THERE? I'M JUST CURIOUS.
03:15:53.897: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  MR. SUMMERS IS FILLING A SPOT RELATED TO TRANSPORTATION RELATED BUSINESS. COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD?
03:16:02.306: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD:  I HAVEN'T MET MR. SUMMERS, BUT I HEARD EXCELLENT REVIEWS OF HIS BUSINESS AND HIS CUSTOMER SERVICE.
03:16:10.647: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [ CHORUS OF AYES ] ALL OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED WITH 11 COUNCILMEMBERS PRESENT, ALL VOTING IN THE AFFIRMATIVE, THUS SATISFYING THE 7-VOTE REQUIREMENT. DC2, RESOLUTION TO PUBLICLY RELEASE REDACTED REPORT OF INVESTIGATION BY ATTORNEY SHELDON STARK DATED JULY 31, 2019 MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRAND, SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM. DISCUSSION, PLEASE, OF DC2. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
03:16:35.472: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I JUST HAVE A FEW BRIEF COMMENTS ON THIS. I'M NOT GOING TO GET INTO ANY SPECIFICS OF THE STARK REPORT OR INDIVIDUALS TONIGHT. I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S APPROPRIATE, BUT I DO VERY MUCH SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION TO RELEASE THE REDACTED VERSION OF THE REPORT. I'M GLAD THAT COUNCIL ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE DECIDED TO DO THAT, AND I'M HAPPY TO BE A COSPONSOR. THIS WHOLE ISSUE OF THE FORMER H.R. DIRECTOR'S EMAILS BECAME A VERY PUBLIC ISSUE. THAT'S NOT TYPICALLY THE CASE WITH INTERNAL PERSONNEL MATTERS, AND MOST OF THE TIME THERE ISN'T A COMPELLING REASON TO SHARE PERSONNEL MATTERS PUBLICLY. THIS SITUATION, HOWEVER, WAS PRETTY SERIOUS, AND IT WAS CERTAINLY UNIQUE. GIVEN ITS SERIOUSNESS, IT WAS APPROPRIATE TO FULLY INVESTIGATE BOTH THE SPECIFICS OF THE INCIDENT AND OF THE COMMENTS MADE, AS WELL AS THE OVERALL CULTURE AT CITY HALL, AND THAT'S WHAT WE ARE DOING, AND THIS REPORT IS ONE ELEMENT OF THAT PROCESS. THE INCIDENT AND COMMENTS MADE WERE ALSO SERIOUS ENOUGH TO WARRANT MAKING THE PUBLIC AWARE OF THE SITUATION, AND ONCE THAT HAPPENS, THE PUBLIC IS AWARE OF THE INCIDENT AND INVESTIGATIONS. IT'S CRITICAL TO CLOSE THE LOOP WITH THE COMMUNITY AND SHARE THE RESULTS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE, AND THAT'S WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO HERE, AND HOPEFULLY WE'LL ALL SUPPORT THIS TONIGHT. THANK YOU.
03:18:06.630: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
03:18:08.298: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  THANK YOU. I WANT TO THANK COUNCILMEMBER LUMM FOR OUTLINING THAT VERY WELL. I THINK IT'S INCUMBENT ON AN INSTITUTION SUCH AS THE CITY, WHEN FACTS COME TO OUR ATTENTION TO PROMPTLY ENGAGE IN A FULL AND FAIR INVESTIGATION, I BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED HERE. I BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE WE CALL FOR THIS, WE OWE IT TO THE PUBLIC TO RELEASE AS MUCH OF IT AS WE CAN WITHOUT BREACHING THE CONFIDENTIALITY THAT WE PROMISE TO THOSE WHO PARTICIPATED, AND SO I ALSO FULLY SUPPORT THE RELEASE OF THIS, AND THEN I'M HAPPY THAT IT'S COME TO A CONCLUSION.
03:18:48.572: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER NELSON. THANK YOU.
03:18:53.210: >> YOU'RE WELCOME.
03:18:55.345: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  I JUST WANT TO COMMENT ON THE FACT THAT THIS IS A VERY REMARKABLE AND UNUSUAL SITUATION. SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE DISCUSSED IN THIS REPORT ARE SORT OF INSIDE CITY HALL STUFF THAT WOULDN'T TYPICALLY AND SHOULDN'T REALLY BE SUBJECT TO GOSSIP, AND SO I JUST WANTED TO COMPLEMENT AND EXPRESS GRATITUDE TO OUR LEGAL DEPARTMENT FOR A CAREFUL REDACTION OF THIS TO PROTECT SPECIFIC PEOPLE IN CITY HALL THAT AREN'T REALLY MEANT TO BE TOPICS OF GOSSIP, AND WE HAD SOME -- I HAD SOME DISCUSSION WITH MR. POSTEMA ABOUT SUGGESTIONS THAT I HAD ABOUT PROTECTING PEOPLE, AND I BELIEVE THAT THIS REDACTED REPORT IS AN APPROPRIATE -- AN APPROPRIATE WAY OF HELPING CLARIFY WHAT HAPPENED WITHOUT HURTING PEOPLE UNNECESSARILY.
03:19:55.906: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
03:19:57.641: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRAND:  THANK YOU. AS A MEMBER OF THE COUNCIL ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE, I WAS INCREDIBLY SUPPORTIVE OF RELEASING THIS REPORT AND DO SUPPORT THE REDACTIONS MADE BY THE LEGAL DEPARTMENT. I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO ARE THE CONCLUSIONS BEING RELEASED IN THIS REPORT, BECAUSE WHILE WE CERTAINLY HAVE MORE WORK TO DO AND WILL BE TALKING LATER, VERY SOON, ABOUT DOING A BROADER CULTURAL ASSESSMENT OF THE CITY, I THINK IT DOES SPEAK TO THE EXCELLENT WORK THAT IS PERFORMED ON A DAY-TO-DAY BASIS BY THE ADMINISTRATION HERE AND REALLY DOES SHOW THE GREAT CARE AND OFTEN PROACTIVE NATURE THAT THEY WERE TAKING TO TRY TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS THAT THEY KNEW ABOUT. I THINK THERE WERE ALSO, UNFORTUNATELY, SOME ACCUSATIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT WERE IMPLIED ABOUT SOME OF OUR STAFF THAT THEY MUST HAVE KNOWN, AND I THINK THIS REPORT SHOWS THAT, INDEED, THOSE OUTRAGEOUS PARTS THAT OFFENDED US ALL HERE AT THIS TABLE WERE, INDEED, NOT KNOWN TO OUR ADMINISTRATION, AND THAT WHEN THEY RECEIVED THAT INFORMATION, THEY ACTED VERY PROMPTLY, AND I THINK IN AN APPROPRIATE MANNER, SO I'M PLEASED TO GET THAT INFORMATION OUT TO THE PUBLIC, BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE KNOW THAT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED.
03:21:32.202: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
03:21:36.106: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD:  I'M ALSO A MEMBER OF THE ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE, AND I AGREE WITH MOST OF THE STATEMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE SO FAR. AS A NEW COUNCILMEMBER, THOUGH, I FEEL SOME RESPONSIBILITY, AS ALL OF US SHOULD, FOR WHAT HAPPENED, AND MORE IMPORTANTLY FOR TAKING ACTIONS TO ENSURE THAT NOTHING LIKE THIS HAPPENS AGAIN, AND I UNDERSTAND THAT AS COUNCILMEMBERS, WE ARE ONLY POLICY MAKERS, BUT WE HAVE TO BE ACCOUNTABLE TO OUR CONSTITUENTS, AND WE NEED TO KEEP THIS TOPIC IN THE FOREFRONT AND DO WHATEVER WE CAN TO MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN, AND ALSO TO ENSURE THAT PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS ARE BEING DONE SO THAT WE HAVE METRICS FOR PERFORMANCE AND WE CAN REWARD OUR EMPLOYEES APPROPRIATELY.
03:22:36.132: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? I WOULD LIKE TO ADD MY $0.02 ON THIS. I AM ON THE ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE AND HAD INTENDED TO BRING A RESOLUTION LIKE THIS, IF THE ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE HAD NOT DONE SO, AND I AM GLAD THAT THEY DID DURING MY ABSENCE. YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT THE INCIDENTS TO WHICH WE ARE ALL REFERRING, THE INCIDENTS THAT ARE DESCRIBED IN THIS REPORT, WERE SHOCKING TO US ALL AND DO NOT REFLECT THE VALUES OR PRACTICES OF THE ORGANIZATION UP AND DOWN THE LINE, AND, YOU KNOW, I AM PLEASED THAT WE HAD THIS REPORT, PUTTING TOGETHER A REPORT SUCH AS THIS WAS THE PROPER AND APPROPRIATE THING TO DO. I OF COURSE ALONG WITH MY COLLEAGUES HAVE READ THE REPORT, AND IT IS INDEED WELL REASONED, AND I BELIEVE IT PUTS TO REST SPECULATION AND UNFOUNDED CRITICISMS THAT HAVE BEEN LEVIED. YOU KNOW, IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE ENGAGE THE FACTS AS THEY EXIST AND THE FACTS AS THEY EXIST ARE ARTICULATED IN THIS REPORT. IT IS MY HOPE THAT HAVING THIS REPORT IN HAND THAT WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY AND THAT WE AVAIL OURSELVES OF THE OPPORTUNITY MOVING FORWARD WITH RENEWED COMMITMENT TO A WORKPLACE THAT MAKES US PROUD. I KNOW THAT THAT'S OUR COMMON COMMITMENT HERE AT THE COUNCIL TABLE, AND I KNOW THAT IT IS ALSO THE COMMITMENT OF STAFF UP AND DOWN THE LINE, AND I THINK THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY AND THE COMMITMENT TO DO SO. FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
03:24:17.333: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  I JUST WANTED TO ECHO SOME OF THE SENTIMENTS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN EXPRESSED AND COMMEND OUR CITY ADMINISTRATOR FOR TAKING ACTION ON THIS AND ALLOWING THINGS TO BE PROBED, AND IT'S INHERENTLY NATURAL FOR PEOPLE TO BECOME SKEPTICAL AND QUESTION AND FEAR THE WORST, I GUESS, AND TO ALLOW THIS TO BE CONDUCTED IN A THOROUGH FASHION AND NOW TO BE RELEASED IN A LIMITED WAY TO PROTECT THE IDENTITIES OF SOME. I JUST WOULD LIKE TO THANK THOSE INVOLVED FOR ALLOWING IT TO HAPPEN AND RELEASING THE RE RESULTS. IT IS WHAT THE COMMUNITY HAS ASKED FOR, AND IT WAS DONE WITHOUT HESITATION. THANK YOU.
03:25:12.589: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [ CHORUS OF AYES ] OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. DC -- WHERE ARE WE -- DC3, THANK YOU, RESOLUTION APPROVING A CONTRACT WITH HARVEST SOLAR, LLC TO PURCHASE AND OVERSEE INSTALLATION OF SOLAR PANELS ON FIRE STATION 6 ($73,710.00) MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER EATON, SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER NELSON. DISCUSSION, PLEASE, OF DC3. COUNCILMEMBER EATON?
03:25:43.219: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  SO THIS RESOLUTION KIND OF INTERSECTS TWO OF MY INTERESTS. THIS SOLAR INSTALLATION WILL HAPPEN AT FIRE STATION 6, WHICH IS IN THE FOURTH WARD, BUT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE OFFICE OF SUSTAINABILITY AND THE ENERGY COMMISSION HAVE BEEN WORKING ON TOGETHER OVER A PERIOD OF TIME. COUNCILMEMBER NELSON HAS JOINED ME AS A COSPONSOR, AND I ASSUME THAT COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER WILL JOIN AS A SPONSOR. HE WAS OUT OF TOWN WHEN WE PROPOSED THIS, BUT IT'S JUST ONE SMALL THING THAT WE ARE DOING TO TRY TO MAKE OUR OWN OPERATIONS MORE SUSTAINABLE, AND I'M REALLY PROUD TO BE A PART OF THIS EFFORT. I BELIEVE THAT OUR SUSTAINABILITY MANAGER IS HERE, AND MAYBE SHE HAS A LITTLE MORE TO SAY, IF YOU WOULD STEP UP AND TELL US ABOUT THIS PROJECT.
03:26:36.005: >> THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER EATON. I THINK YOU DID A REALLY NICE JOB LAYING KIND OF THE BACKGROUND ON THIS PROJECT. BASICALLY, WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR A WHILE TO DO A SOLAR INSTALLATION, AND OUR COUNTERPARTS IN YPSI HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR A LITTLE WHILE USING VOLUNTEERS FROM THE COMMUNITY AND THEIR PASSION TO GET SOLAR INSTALLATIONS MOVE FORWARD. WE HAD STUDENTS FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN WHO REACHED OUT. THEY WANTED TO BE A PART OF THIS. THEY WANTED IT TO BE A PART OF THEIR CURRICULUM. UNFORTUNATELY, THEY COULDN'T GET SUPPORT AT THE UNIVERSITY FOR AN ON-SITE INSTALLATION, SO I PICKED UP THE PHONE, CALLED KENNEDY, AND HE SAID YES. I DON'T KNOW IF HE KNEW WHAT HE WAS GETTING INTO. WE ARE GOING TO DO A BATTERY READY INSTALLATION. WE ARE NOT GOING TO INVEST IN A BATTERY RIGHT NOW. IT'S PRETTY EXPENSIVE, BUT WE ARE GOING TO DO THE ELECTRICAL WIRING SO THAT WE CAN EVENTUALLY ATTACH A BATTERY, MEANING IF THE GRID GOES DOWN, OUR FIRE STATION IS OKAY, AND THE GOAL IS TO FIGURE OUT HOW ALL OF THIS WORKS SO WE CAN SCALE IT THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY. THIS HAS BEEN A HERCULEAN EFFORT.
03:27:54.617: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  I NOTICED THAT YOU BROUGHT CHIEF KENNEDY WITH YOU. SHOULD WE INVITE HIM TO SAY SOMETHING?
03:27:59.489: >> WE SHOULD, I THINK. YEAH, I DO.
03:28:02.492: >> GOOD EVENING, MAYOR AND COUNCIL. MIKE KENNEDY. FIRE CHIEF. MISSY DID ALL OF THE HEAVY LIFTING ON THIS. I'M JUST KIND OF RIDING HER COATTAILS, BUT I'M GLAD THAT IT WORKED OUT. COUNCILMEMBER EATON, THIS CHECKS A LOT OF BOXES. IT CHECKS SUSTAINABILITY. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED STATION 6 AS ONE NOT BEING MOVED. IT MAKES A SOLID, SUSTAINABLE INVESTMENT IN THAT GOING FORWARD, SO IT'S AN EXAMPLE OF A LOT OF GOOD THINGS COMING TOGETHER AND CHECKING A LOT OF BOXES, SO WE ARE HAPPY TO BE A PART OF IT.
03:28:33.956: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  THANK YOU.
03:28:36.459: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN?
03:28:37.927: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR, AND THANK YOU DR. STULTS, AND CONGRATULATIONS TO COUNCILMEMBER EATON. I'M EXCITED TO WORK WITH THE SAME DYNAMIC DUO ON FIRE STATION 4, WHICH THE FIRE STATION MASTER PLAN IDENTIFIES AS POTENTIALLY THE FIRST NET NEUTRAL FIRE STATION THIS SIDE OF THE MISSISSIPPI. IT SITS IN WARD 3 AND SERVES THE SOUTHEAST SIDE OF TOWN, SO WE'LL TRY TO ONE-UP YOU GUYS SOON ENOUGH.
03:29:07.857: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER LUMM AND THEN HAYNER.
03:29:10.860: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  I DID HAVE MY HAND UP BEFORE -- NO, YOU'RE CALLING ON US IN ORDER. I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SAY, EVEN BEFORE I KNEW THAT YOU WERE GOING TO PLUG IN FOR STATION FOUR, GUESS WHERE I'M COMING FROM, STATION FIVE. THAT'S A REALLY OLD DETERIORATED FIRE STATION THAT SITS ON THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN'S CAMPUS, AND WE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THE UNIVERSITY'S FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE WITH THE REBUILD OF THAT STATION, AND SO I'M HOPING WE LOOK AT THIS AS A POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITY THERE AS WELL, AND MY GOODNESS, THE UNIVERSITY HAS ALL OF THIS EXPERTISE. SURELY THEY CAN -- I KNOW THEY ARE GOING TO HELP WITH THE DESIGN, APPARENTLY, BUT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE WOULD GO A LONG WAY.
03:29:58.574: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
03:29:59.542: >> THANKS.
03:29:59.842: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  THANK YOU. AND IF IT PLEASES THE ORIGINAL TWO SPONSORS, I WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED TO THIS AS A SPONSOR. I ACTUALLY HAD PUT MYSELF ON A LIST TO HELP WITH THIS INSTALLATION. THIS IS THE SAME ONE, RIGHT? BUT IT GOT SO DRAGGED OUT, I THOUGHT MAYBE IT INSTALLED WITHOUT ME OR SOMETHING. I DIDN'T SEE IT PASS BY US HERE, SO PLEASE ADD ME TO THAT THAT LIST ALSO. I'M HAPPY TO DO IT. IT WOULD BE MY SECOND TIME INSTALLING SOLAR PANELS, AND THIS ONE WOULD BE MORE FUN, BECAUSE IT'S FLAT ROOF, IF I'M NOT MISTAKING. YEAH. IT'S A LOT EASIER ON A FLAT ROOF, LET ME JUST TELL YOU. THANK YOU.
03:30:39.849: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
03:30:40.950: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  THANK YOU. JUST SOME QUESTIONS. HOW MUCH ELECTRICITY WILL THIS PRODUCE? IS IT GOING TO PRODUCE MORE THAN THE STATION USES? IS IT GOING TO PUT BACK ON THE GRID? HOW MANY HOMES IS THIS GOING TO POWER, LET'S SAY, JUST TO KIND OF PUT IT IN TO PERSPECTIVE FOR FOLKS THAT DON'T KNOW THE TECHNICAL TERMS OF KILOWATTS AND WHAT IT IS.
03:31:00.736: >> YEAH, LET ME TAKE A STEP BACK AND GIVE YOU THAT CALCULATION, BUT IN TERMS OF THE ACTUAL KILOWATT POTENTIAL, IT'S IN THE RESOLUTION, 64,000-KILOWATTS. THE SITE, THE WAY WE DESIGNED THE SYSTEM WAS TO MATCH AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE TO ACTUAL LOAD, SO THE IDEA IS DURING PEAK PERFORMANCE, IT WILL BE A HUNDRED PERCENT POWERING THE STATION.
03:31:21.490: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  OKAY. BUT IT DOESN'T PRODUCE ANY SURPLUS?
03:31:24.760: >> IT MIGHT DURING CERTAIN PERIODS, BUT WE CAN'T ACTUALLY, IN TERMS OF INSTALLING SOLAR ON SITE, YOU CAN ONLY DO A MINIMUM SURPLUS PER OUR GRID AND D.T.E., THE WAY WE HOOK IN. WE COULDN'T GO ABOVE AND BEYOND. I BELIEVE YOU CAN DO 10% OVER CAPACITY, DON'T QUOTE ME, SO THERE WILL BE TIMES WHERE WE OVERGENERATE AND THERE WILL STILL BE SOME TIMES THAT WE PULL FROM THE GRID.
03:31:50.453: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  DUE TO REGULATIONS, YOU'RE CAPPED AS TO WHAT PRODUCTION IS?
03:31:56.893: >> YEAH. WE ARE FOCUSING SOLELY ON THE ROOF FOR THIS, BECAUSE WE HAVE THIS BEAUTIFUL FLAT ROOF, AND WE HAVE GOT TWO LEVELS, SO WE ARE GOING TO MAXIMIZE WHAT WE DO PER ROOF.
03:32:06.202: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  WE APPRECIATE IT, AND THIS IS THE KIND OF PROJECT THAT WE IN THE COMMUNITY LOVE TO SEE.
03:32:12.875: >> I'LL SIGN YOU UP TOO. ALL RIGHT.
03:32:15.144: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  ALL RIGHT.
03:32:17.580: >> WEAR A HAT.
03:32:20.182: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION, COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD?
03:32:22.485: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD:  YES, I WOULD LIKE TO BE LISTED AS A COSPONSOR, AND I JUST WANT TO SAY CONGRATULATIONS. THIS IS REALLY EXCITING. AND ANOTHER THING, DTE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE AS FLEXIBLE AND SUPPORTIVE AS CONSUMERS POWER, AND I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY THAT PUBLICLY, BECAUSE I REALLY THINK THAT WE SHOULD PUSH THEM A LITTLE BIT HARDER. THANK YOU.
03:32:44.907: >> NOTED.
03:32:46.676: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? I WOULD OF COURSE LIKE TO ADD MY TWO CENTS OF CONGRATULATIONS AND DELIGHT THAT THIS IS MOVING FORWARD. YOU KNOW, IT DOES, YOU KNOW, SATISFY A LOT OF OUR COMMUNITY'S GOALS, AND IT'S EXCELLENT IN MAKING STATION SIX MORE RESILIENT AND OF COURSE DOING WHAT WE CAN TO DO OUR PART ON CLIMATE ACTION IS VERY IMPORTANT, AND THE CITY LOOKS FOR US TO LEAD ON SOLAR, AND THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [ CHORUS OF AYES ] OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. DC4, RESOLUTION TO ADVOCATE FOR THE EXPANSION OF THE STATE OF MICHIGAN RECYCLING GROUNDS. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER SMITH, SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER NELSON. DISCUSSION PLEASE OF DC4. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM. THANK YOU.
03:33:35.725: >> THANKS, MR. MAYOR. BRIEFLY, THIS RESOLUTION -- FIRST, I WOULD LIKE TO THANK ASSISTANT CITY ADMINISTRATOR JOHN FOURNIER FOR PULLING THIS TOGETHER AND DRAFTING THE RESOLUTION, SO, THANK YOU. BRIEFLY, THIS RESOLUTION IS SPONSORED BY THE COUNCIL POLICY AGENDA COMMITTEE. COUNCILMEMBERS EATON, HAYNER, GRISWOLD, SMITH AND MYSELF, AND WHAT IT DOES IS TO PRIORITIZE THE STATE'S FUNDING FOR THE RECYCLING AND MARKET GRANT PROGRAM. IT HAS BEEN AROUND SINCE 2014, BUT WITH THE VIRTUAL COLLAPSE OF RECYCLING MARKETS GLOBALLY, WITH SOME COMMUNITIES CHOOSING TO LANDFILL RATHER THAN RECYCLE, IT'S A CRITICAL JUNCTURE FOR RECYCLING, AND THERE IS NO BETTER TIME THAN NOW TO STEP UP THE INVESTMENT AND DEVELOPMENT OF RECYCLING MARKETS. OTHER STATES ARE DOING THIS. THIS NEEDS TO BE ON OUR STATE'S RADAR AS WELL. AND SO THAT'S WHAT THIS RESOLUTION ENCOURAGES THE GOVERNOR AND STATE LEGISLATORS TO DO, AND HOPEFULLY YOU'LL AGREE WITH THE POLICY, THE AGENDA COMMITTEE, THAT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PRIORITY, SO,THANK YOU.
03:34:45.361: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
03:34:48.531: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  I WOULD JUST LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A COSPONSOR, PLEASE.
03:34:53.035: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER?
03:34:53.969: >> COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER:  ME TOO.
03:34:55.004: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [ CHORUS OF AYES ] OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. DS1, RESOLUTION TO APPROVE A PROFESSIONAL SERVICES AGREEMENT WITH SDS GLOBAL ENTERPRISES, INC. FOR DIVERSITY, EQUITY, AND INCLUSION PLAN SERVICES ($161,000.00) MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN, SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER SMITH. DISCUSSION, PLEASE, OF DS1. ALL IN FAVOR? [ CHORUS OF AYES ] OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. DS2 --
03:35:26.836: >> IT'S OKAY.
03:35:29.305: >> ROLL CALL?
03:35:30.673: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  THAT'S OKAY.
03:35:31.540: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  I DIDN'T HEAR YOU. I'M SORRY.
03:35:34.176: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  JUST PUT ME DOWN AS OPPOSED TO THAT.
03:35:37.847: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  ALL RIGHT, IT IS APPROVED WITH 11 COUNCILMEMBERS PRESENT, TEN VOTING FOR IT AND COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER IN OPPOSITION. DS2, RESOLUTION TO PROCEED WITH A ROAD RECONFIGURATION PILOT FOR TRAVERWOOD DRIVE, FROM HURON PARKWAY TO PLYMOUTH ROAD MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM. DISCUSSION, PLEASE, OF DS2. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
03:36:00.870: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  SO, THIS GOT A LITTLE CONFUSING FROM -- THESE TWO PROJECTS FROM A WHERE ARE WE AT PERSPECTIVE, SO I VOTED FOR THIS THE FIRST TIME WITH THE PARKING ON ONE SIDE, YOU KNOW, AGAINST MY KIND OF CONCERNS THAT THAT WASN'T THE SAFEST OPTION, AND SO THIS HAS BEEN BROUGHT BACK, AND THIS IS -- ARE WE NOW LOOKING AT A SECOND OPTION, OR DOES THAT HAVE TO BE MOVED? ANYBODY?
03:36:33.636: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  MR. LAZARUS?
03:36:34.503: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  WHERE ARE WE AT WITH THIS?
03:36:38.607: >> CITY ADMIN. LAZARUS:  LAST MEETING, COUNCIL VOTED TO RESCIND THE APPROVAL OF THE ORIGINAL DRAWINGS THAT WERE PROVIDED, WHICH HAD THE BIKE LANE ON THE UPHILL SIDE AND SHARED BIKE LANE ON THE DOWNHILL SIDE. THIS IS AN ITEM FROM STAFF, BECAUSE WHAT WE HAVE BROUGHT BACK IS ESSENTIALLY A NEW PROPOSAL.
03:37:03.899: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  OKAY.
03:37:08.837: >> WAS IT PUT ON THE AGENDA OR POSTPONED?
03:37:12.007: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  IS THAT RIGHT?
03:37:15.778: >> CITY ADMIN. LAZARUS:  THEY VOTED TO RESCIND IT.
03:37:17.913: >> I THOUGHT IT WAS A RECONSIDERATION.
03:37:20.616: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  I THOUGHT IT WAS A POSTPONE.
03:37:25.754: >> CITY ADMIN. LAZARUS:  I DON'T THINK SO.
03:37:26.922: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN:  I WITHDREW GREEN, I THOUGHT.
03:37:29.892: >> MS. BEAUDRY?
03:37:31.493: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN:  I SHOULD HAVE KEPT IT CONSISTENT.
03:37:34.129: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  DO YOU WANT TO SAY THAT AGAIN, PLEASE?
03:37:36.599: >> CLERK BEAUDRY:  IT WAS RECONSIDERED AND THEN IT WAS POSTPONED.
03:37:41.103: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.
03:37:42.071: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  SO WHAT'S BEFORE US IS THE SAME, BUT WE KNOW THAT STAFF HAS GONE AHEAD AND MADE SOME CHANGES THAT WE THINK ARE MORE SATISFACTORY? OR WOULD SOMEONE LIKE TO EXPLAIN WHERE WE ARE AT, WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT HERE?
03:37:57.353: >> CITY ADMIN. LAZARUS:  SO ESSENTIALLY YOU'RE LOOKING AT BIKE LANES ON BOTH SIDES OF THE STREET, AS OPPOSED TO ONE SIDE WITH PARKING ON THE OTHER.
03:38:04.226: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN:  BUT PROCEDURALLY, IF WE VOTED TO RECONSIDER AND POSTPONE THAT MOTION, TECHNICALLY, WE ARE VOTING ON THE ORIGINAL, AND A MOTION TO REPLACE WOULD HAVE TO BE MADE.
03:38:15.904: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  I AGREE.
03:38:16.739: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  I THINK THAT SOUNDS RIGHT.
03:38:19.642: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  SO I WOULD MAKE THAT MOTION. THERE'S A REVISED ATTACHMENT A, I BELIEVE, THAT SHOWS BIKE LANES ON BOTH SIDES OF THE STREET, SO I WOULD MOVE THAT WE AMEND THIS TO REFLECT THAT REVISION IN ATTACHMENT A.
03:38:38.894: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD. DISCUSSION OF THAT AMENDMENT? COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN AND THEN GRISWOLD.
03:38:46.235: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I THINK -- SO, I WAS OPEN TO THIS AT THE LAST MEETING WITH SOME ASSURANCE THAT THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY CENTER, THE MOSQUE HAD BEEN, I GUESS, ENGAGED AND HAD PROVIDED FEEDBACK ON POSSIBLE REVISIONS. I WOULD LOVE TO GET SOME MORE FEEDBACK ON THAT, BECAUSE TONIGHT THE PUBLIC INPUT AND PUBLIC COMMENT, AS WELL AS A NUMBER OF EMAILS FROM THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY COUNTER THAT, AND I FEEL VERY, VERY UNCOMFORTABLE HAVING PROMISED A FAITH COMMUNITY SOMETHING, A HOUSE OF WORSHIP SOMETHING -- OR NOT EVEN PROMISED BUT, YOU KNOW, LOFTED, AND THEN TAKING THAT BACK. THAT FEELS LIKE A BAD WAY TO ENGAGE THE COMMUNITY, AND THAT MAKES ME UNCOMFORTABLE, SO I WOULD LOVE TO GET A LITTLE MORE CLARITY ON HOW MUCH THE MOSQUE HAD BEEN ENGAGED (SPEECH AWAY FROM MICROPHONE) --
03:39:46.829: >> ARE WE DISCUSSING THE AMENDMENT?
03:39:50.532: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN: YEAH. IT WILL INFORM MY VOTE ULTIMATELY.
03:39:53.502: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  MR. HESS?
03:39:55.204: >> YES, COUNCILMEMBERS. RAYMOND HESS AGAIN. SO, WE WOULD ANTICIPATE THAT WE PUT UP SIGNAGE SIMILAR TO WHAT WE HAVE AROUND THE CHURCHES DOWNTOWN, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT ALLOW PARKING IN THE BIKE LANE ON SUNDAY, AND, IN THIS INSTANCE, FOR THE CHURCHES DOWNTOWN. WE WOULD ANTICIPATE HAVING A SIMILAR ACCOMMODATION FOR THE ISLAMIC CENTER ON FRIDAYS. WE WOULD FOLLOW UP WITH THE EXACT HOURS OF THAT REQUEST. WE HAVE SOME DOCUMENTATION PREVIOUSLY THAT SAID BETWEEN 11:30 AND 2:30 TO ALLOW PARKING WITHIN THAT TIME FRAME, BUT WE WOULD FOLLOW UP WITH THEM BEFORE THAT FINAL DETERMINATION WOULD BE MADE. BUT, ULTIMATELY, BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN KIND OF TWO DIFFERENT DESIGN CONCEPTS ON THE TABLE, WE WERE WAITING FOR CUES FROM COUNCIL ON HOW TO FIGURE OUT THE PARKING AND SIGNAGE PIECE.
03:40:49.792: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN:  SO IT SEEMED LIKE THE MOSQUE LEADERSHIP, EVEN THE IMAM HIMSELF CAME AND SPOKE TONIGHT AND EXPLICITLY REQUESTED THE ON-STREET PARKING BE PRESERVED. IS THAT OTHER PEOPLE'S READ OF THE SITUATION AS WELL? IT SEEMED TO BE --
03:41:09.611: >> NOT EXACTLY, AND I HAVE SPENT MANY HOURS WITH THEM ON SITE TOURING. WHAT THEY WANT IS THE ABILITY TO PARK. THERE IS SOME CONFUSION, BECAUSE IF WE HAVE ON-STREET PARKING AND THAT IS A VIOLATION OF COMPLETE STREETS -- BUT FIRST I WANT TO BACK UP AND I WANT TO THANK STAFF FOR WHAT THEY HAVE DONE. I THINK THAT THEY HAVE COME UP WITH AN OPTIMAL SOLUTION. IN ORDER TO ALLOW PARKING DURING RELIGIOUS EVENTS AND NOT HAVE IT FILL UP WITH COMMUTERS BY 8:00 A.M. EVERY MORNING, THE AMENDMENT THAT'S BEFORE US, I BELIEVE, IS THE OPTIMAL SOLUTION, AND I KNOW THAT THEY BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS A COMMITMENT FOR ON-STREET PARKING, BUT I DON'T SEE ANY WAY THAT WE CAN HAVE ON-STREET PARKING AND PRESERVE IT FOR THE ISLAMIC CENTER UNLESS WE GO ALONG WITH THE PROPOSAL FROM STAFF.
03:42:17.779: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  LET ME SUGGEST THIS. WE HAVE RECEIVED A LOT OF COMMUNICATION FROM MEMBERS OF THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY AND THE LEADERSHIP OF THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY, AND, IN MY VIEW, AND I THINK IT'S PLAIN, THE COMMUNICATION WAS VERY CLEAR. THEY WANT THE OLD -- THEY WANT THE OLD SYSTEM, THE OLD RULE. THOSE ARE THE WORDS THAT THEY HAVE SAID. WHAT I HEAR IS THAT WE BELIEVE THAT WE CAN MEET THEIR GOALS AS THEY HAVE ARTICULATED THEM WITH AN ADMINISTRATIVE RULE ASSOCIATED WITH TWO BIKE LANES. IT SEEMS TO ME, I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE DO THIS. I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THIS AMENDMENT BE WITHDRAWN SO THAT WE DO NOT TAKE ACTION DIRECTLY CONTRARY TO WHAT THE COMMUNITY IS LOOKING FOR, THAT WE POSTPONE THIS YET AGAIN SO THAT STAFF HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO COORDINATE WITH THE MCA LEADERSHIP, ADVISE THEM AS TO WHAT THIS, YOU KNOW, OTHER WAY IS, THIS OTHER OPTION IS, DEMONSTRATE ITS USE PRESENTLY ON OTHER MAJOR ARTERIES, HURON AND THE LIKE, AND THEN BRING IT ON BACK TO US AND GIVE US AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE WORKED WITH THEM AND BRING FORWARD A PROPOSAL THAT THEY HAVE ADVANCED BUY-IN SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN WHAT'S GOING ON AFTER WE'VE DONE IT. THAT'S MY SUGGESTION. I HAVE GOT COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI AND THEN NELSON AND THEN HAYNER.
03:43:51.740: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI: DURING THE LAST COUNCIL MEETING, I DESCRIBED THIS AS BANANAS. AND I'LL CONTINUE TO DESCRIBE IT THAT WAY. IT'S GOT US TWISTED, TURNED, CONFUSED AND PERPLEXED, AND IT'S NOT GOOD GOVERNMENT. AS SOMEONE WHO WAS BORN IN THE MUSLIM FAITH, AS SOMEONE WHO HAS ATTENDED MANY -- WHETHER THEY ARE FUNERALS OR PRAYERS AT THE LOCATION THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT, I FEEL LIKE I HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE OF AN INSIGHT ON THEIR NEEDS, AND THEIR NEEDS ARE NOT JUST ON FRIDAYS. THEIR NEEDS HAPPEN TO BE WHEN SOMEONE PASSES AWAY, AND THAT -- AND IN THE ISLAMIC FAITH, IF YOU DIE AFTER SUNRISE, YOU NEED TO BE BURIED BEFORE SUNSET. IT'S NOT JUST FRIDAYS AT 1:00, SO WHEN YOU DIE, YOUR BODY IS TAKEN TO THE MOSQUE, THERE ARE PRAYERS PERFORMED FOR THE DEAD BEFORE IT GOES TO THE CEREMONY. I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW YOU'RE GOING TO REGULATE WHEN SOMEBODY PASSES AWAY. FURTHERMORE, AS A CYCLIST, IT BOTHERS ME ON SUNDAYS WHEN A BIKE LANE IS INTERRUPTED WITH CARS. EITHER MAKE A DECISION, IT'S THIS, OR IT'S THAT. YOU CAN'T HAVE EVERYTHING, AND WE DISCUSSED IT, WE DEBATED IT, WE VOTED ON IT, WE APPROVED IT, AND NOW IT'S JUST TURNED INTO THIS QUAGMIRE. SO, I JUST WANT TO OFFER A LITTLE BIT OF INSIGHT FOR THE FOLKS WHO GO INTO THE MOSQUE FOR PRAYER, AND IT'S NOT JUST FOR FRIDAY, BUT IT'S ALSO FOR FUNERALS, AND THOSE -- I MISS FUNERALS, BECAUSE IT HAS TO HAPPEN IN THE SAME DAY.
03:46:04.072: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
03:46:05.073: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI. I REALLY APPRECIATE A PERSPECTIVE LIKE THAT FROM SOMEBODY WHO OBVIOUSLY HAS KNOWLEDGE THAT THE REST OF US DON'T. I HAD A QUESTION AROUND THE SUBSTANTIAL -- THE SUBSTANCE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ORIGINAL PLAN AND HAVING SIGNAGE FOR SPECIFIC TIMES. IS THERE A DIFFERENCE IN THE NUMBER OF SPACES THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE, EITHER HAVING PARKING WIDELY AVAILABLE JUST ALL THE TIME, VERSUS THIS SIGNAGE AROUND FRIDAY AFTERNOON? IS THERE A DIFFERENCE IN THE NUMBER OF SPACES THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE?
03:46:49.718: >> ADMITTEDLY, I DON'T THINK WE HAVE CALCULATED THAT. I KNOW IN THE ORIGINAL PROPOSAL, THERE WERE AROUND 70 OR SO SPACES THAT WERE CREATED, IF MEMORY SERVES ME CORRECTLY. I WOULD SUSPECT THAT THAT NUMBER IS FAIRLY CONSISTENT. WITH THE NEWER CONDITION THAT I HAVE DESCRIBED, ABOUT BEING ABLE TO PARK IN THE BIKE LANE, IT WOULD BE FAIRLY SIMILAR NUMBERS, I WOULD IMAGINE, BECAUSE IT'S ULTIMATELY THE SAME LENGTH OF ROADWAY THAT WE ARE CONTEMPLATING.
03:47:13.608: >> OKAY. THANK YOU.
03:47:16.578: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
03:47:23.518: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  I WAS GOING TO SUPPORT, MR. MAYOR, WHAT YOU HAD SAID EARLIER, THAT MAYBE WE SHOULD PULL THIS BACK, AND I SAW IN MY EMAIL THAT YOU WROTE AN EXCELLENT RESPONSE TO SOME OF THOSE FOLKS, AND I WONDERED IF YOU HAD HEARD BACK FROM ANY OF THEM, IF THAT HELPED CLARIFY AT ALL, BECAUSE I THOUGHT WHAT YOU SAID PRIOR TO THIS, WHERE YOU KIND OF DESCRIBED WHAT YOU DID NOW, IS SORT OF APPROPRIATE AND A SECOND BEST FOR ME. I ACTUALLY LIKED THE OLD WAY, WHAT COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI SAID. THAT'S WHY I VOTED FOR IT THEN. I MEAN, I DIDN'T LOVE IT, BUT THE NEEDS OF THE MOSQUE AND THE COMMUNITY AND AAAT AND THE OTHER THINGS, NEED FOR PARKING DESPITE OUR VISION ZERO GOALS --
03:48:07.596: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  I HAVE RECEIVED SOME RESPONSES ALONG THE LINES OF, YOU KNOW, THANK YOU, RATHER THAN A FULL ENGAGEMENT WITH THE BIKE LANE QUESTION. I THINK THAT'S A CONVERSATION THAT WE WOULD NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE NATURE OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE RULE. IN FACT, MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT WE CAN BE RESPONSIVE TO, YOU KNOW, SPECIAL EVENTS THAT ARISE WITH IMMEDIACY. IF COMMUNITY SERVICES KNOWS THERE IS A SPECIAL EVENT, ALL THAT IT TAKES IS A PHONE CALL, AND OVERFLOW PARKING WILL BE PERMITTED ON ANY DAY. THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE RULE, BUT, NO, I HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANYTHING OF PARTICULARITY ON THAT POINT.
03:48:55.844: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  WE ARE SPEAKING TO THIS MODIFIED OPERATION HERE, AND, I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. LIKE COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI SAID, WE ARE GOING BACK AND FORTH ON IT, AND I RELUCTANTLY SUPPORTED PARKING, AND I'M HAPPY TO DO THAT AGAIN. SO, YOU KNOW, LET US KNOW WHAT WE ARE VOTING ON, WHAT ARE YOU CALLING FOR IN THE VOTE. I WOULD APPRECIATE THAT.
03:49:18.199: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
03:49:20.035: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  THANKS, MR. MAYOR. I SUPPORTED THE ORIGINAL TRAVERWOOD PROPOSAL THAT INCLUDED PARKING, AND I WOULD DO THAT AGAIN. I'LL ALSO SUPPORT THE REVISED PROPOSAL IF THAT'S COUNCIL'S PREFERENCE. IN EITHER CASE, TRAVERWOOD IS NOT A SITUATION LIKE WE HAVE WITH THE NEXT ROAD PROPOSAL ON THE AGENDA, FOR GREEN ROAD, WHERE CONDITIONS ARE SUCH THAT A ROAD DIET JUST ISN'T APPROPRIATE. OBVIOUSLY, THE DEBATE HERE HAS CENTERED AROUND ADDING PARKING VERSUS BIKE LANES ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ROAD, AND I ASKED FOR CLARIFICATION ON SAFETY PROS AND CONS OF THE TWO ALTERNATIVES, AND MY READING OF THE RESPONSE IS THAT THERE IS NOT A CLEAR WINNER IN TERMS OF SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS. THE ADDED PARKING HAS BOTH SAFETY BENEFITS AND RISKS. MY READING OF THE RESPONSE MAY NOT BE CORRECT, BUT IF IT IS, AND IF THERE IS A NEED FOR THE ADDITIONAL PARKING AND BASED ON THE INPUT WE HAVE RECEIVED FROM MANY MEMBERS OF THE ISLAMIC CENTER, THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN TURNER GERIATRIC CENTER, THE COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING, THE LIBRARY, IT APPEARS THERE IS A NEED FOR ADDITIONAL PARKING. I'M ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT HAS BEEN REPRESENTED TO THE ISLAMIC CENTER IN MAKING THIS EXCLUSIVELY FOR -- I UNDERSTAND THEIR NEEDS, BUT, AGAIN, WE HAVE HEARD FROM OTHER ORGANIZATIONS WHO EXPRESSED SIMILAR NEEDS FOR PARKING ON THIS PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY. SO, WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE ME? I'M THINKING IT MAY MAKE MORE SENSE TO STICK WITH THE ORIGINAL DESIGN FROM STAFF THAT INCORPORATES THE PARKING AND ADDS A BIKE LANE ON JUST ONE SIDE OF THE STREET. AGAIN, I'M COMFORTABLE EITHER WAY. I APPRECIATE HEARING THE VIEWS OF MY COLLEAGUES. IN ANY EVENT, THOUGH, I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE DECIDE SOMETHING. THESE DEBATES ON THE ROAD DIETS HAVE GONE ON LONG ENOUGH. IT'S TAKING A LOT OF STAFF TIME, AND WE ARE AT THE POINT WHERE THERE IS NOT NEW INFORMATION. SO, THANKS.
03:51:35.336: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
03:51:39.407: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD:  I HAVE BEEN TO THE MOSQUE MANY TIMES, AND I HAVE LIVED WITH A MUSLIM FAMILY, SO I FELT SOME RESPONSIBILITY FOR PROVIDING PARKING FOR THE ISLAMIC CENTER WHEN THEY NEEDED PARKING, AND MY CONCERN IS THAT WE NEED TO BETTER DEFINE WHAT THE PROBLEM. WHAT PROBLEM ARE WE TRYING TO SOLVE? TOP PRIORITY IS PARKING FOR THE ISLAMIC CENTER. HOW CAN WE ENSURE THAT THERE WILL BE PARKING AT THE ISLAMIC CENTER FOR ANY SPECIAL EVENTS, AS WELL AS FOR FRIDAY SERVICES? AND IF WE HAVE GENERAL PARKING ON TRAVERWOOD, I BELIEVE THAT COMMUTERS WILL TAKE THAT, AND SO WE ARE GOING THROUGH THE MOTION OF SAYING WE ARE GOING TO PUT PARKING ON TRAVERWOOD FOR THE ISLAMIC CENTER, BUT IF IT'S GENERAL PARKING, IT WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR THE ISLAMIC CENTER WHEN THEY NEED IT, AND THAT'S MY QUESTION. IS THERE A WAY TO ENSURE PARKING FOR THE ISLAMIC CENTER FOR IMMEDIATE EVENTS WITH VERY LITTLE NOTICE IF WE ALSO ALLOW GENERAL PARKING?
03:52:53.648: >> SO LET ME, IF I MAY, ADDRESS THE -- WHAT WE'D ANTICIPATE KIND OF THE RECURRING FRIDAY NEED. I THINK THAT COULD PROBABLY BE ADDRESSED THROUGH ALMOST LIKE HOW WE REGULATE RESIDENTIAL PARKING PERMITS, RIGHT, YOU KNOW, THE TWO-HOUR LIMIT EXCEPT FOR SUCH AND SUCH A DATE. SO WE COULD SIGN, FOR EXAMPLE, ON FRIDAYS, A TWO-HOUR LIMIT ON FRIDAYS, SO I THINK FOR THAT WEEKLY OCCURRENCE, THAT COULD BE ADDRESSED IN THAT FASHION. THE OTHER EVENTS, FUNERALS AND OTHER EVENTS THAT MAY COME UP WOULD BE, YOU KNOW, IF THERE ARE HIGH HOLY DAYS THAT WE KNOW IN ADVANCE, THOSE COULD BE ADDRESSED, I THINK IN ADVANCE. OTHER EVENTS WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT MORE DIFFICULT, IN PART BECAUSE DO WE HAVE A MECHANISM TO PREVENT, I THINK TO THE POINT YOU'RE GETTING AT, OTHER PEOPLE FROM PARKING THERE, SHORT OF KIND OF BARRICADING THOSE SPOTS, AND THERE MAY NOT BE STAFF CREWS AVAILABLE TO DO THAT AFTER-HOURS O BEFORE REGULAR BUSINESS HOURS, SO ADMITTEDLY THAT PRESENTS A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A CHALLENGE FOR US. IT MAY NOT BE INSURMOUNTABLE, BUT I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD HOW WE COULD ADDRESS FUNERALS AND OTHER SPECIAL EVENTS THAT MAY ARISE THAT AREN'T ANTICIPATED.
03:54:20.602: >> OKAY. THANKS, AND I APPRECIATE ALL OF THE TIME THAT YOU SPENT TRYING TO COME UP WITH CREATIVE SOLUTIONS.
03:54:30.678: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER GRAND?
03:54:31.813: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRAND:  I APPRECIATE BOTH COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI'S COMMENTS AND ASTUTE BANANAS ANALYSIS. I'LL ASK MR. HESS, AND I DON'T LIKE TO MICROMANAGE THIS WAY, BUT WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE TO THINK ABOUT FOUR-HOUR PARKING?
03:54:48.496: >> ON FRIDAYS, OR ALL THE TIME?
03:54:52.500: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRAND:  JUST ALL THE TIME.
03:54:54.035: >> IT'S A POSSIBILITY. I THINK ULTIMATELY WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IS WHAT IS THE ROAD CONFIGURATION, AND THEN WE WERE GOING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE PARKING SITUATION IS, BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE THE PARKING SITUATION IS DRIVING THE ROAD CONFIGURATION. SO I SUPPOSE THAT'S AS MUCH IN THE TOOLKIT AS ANY OF THE OTHER OPTIONS.
03:55:14.789: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRAND:  SO MY SUGGESTION IS THAT WE WITHDRAW AND THAT WE DEFER TO STAFF'S JUDGMENT ABOUT HOW TO HANDLE THIS PARKING SITUATION AND WORKING WITH THE MCA.
03:55:27.168: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
03:55:28.403: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  I WOULD ALSO ASK THAT WE WORK WITH -- WE HAVE HEARD FROM U OF M TURNER GERIATRIC CENTER, WHO EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR STAFF'S ORIGINAL PROPOSAL, BECAUSE THEY ASSUME THAT THEY CAN PARK THERE. THIS IS A PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY AFTER ALL. SIMILARLY, WE GOT A LETTER FROM THE EUPHEMISM COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING. THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO PARK THERE. THE LIBRARY -- WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN MUCH FEEDBACK ON THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL FROM THE SURVEYS. YOU DID INDICATE THEN THAT -- YOU SHARED THEN THAT THE LIBRARY AND THE ISLAMIC CENTER EXPRESSED INTEREST IN THIS ON-STREET PARKING, SO WE NEED TO CIRCLE BACK TO ALL OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS, AT LEAST WHO HAVE CONTACTED US, AND CLARIFY EVERYONE'S UNDERSTANDING OF, YOU KNOW, WHAT CAN BE ALLOCATED IN TERMS OF ON STREET PARKING, IF THERE IS TO BE ON-STREET PARKING, AND HOW THAT'S TO BE ENFORCED OR MANAGED, BECAUSE I THINK THERE ARE LOTS OF MISUNDERSTANDINGS OUT THERE BY THESE VARIOUS ENTITIES WHO ARE ASSUMING THAT -- AND WHAT I SEE ON HURON PARKWAY, THERE'S OF COURSE NO CHURCH NEARBY OR LIBRARY OR -- WELL, U OF M ENGINEERING FOLKS ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE OUT THERE, WHICH IS A GOOD THING, BUT THAT AREA, THAT STRETCH OF ROAD WHERE WE HAVE ON-STREET PARKING IS -- IT'S BUMPER TO BUMPER MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY, AND IT'S BASICALLY FIRST COME, FIRST SERVE. WE HAVE ALSO HAD ISSUES WITH COMMUTER PARKING ON SOME OF THE PRIVATE PROPERTIES OUT THERE AND SOME OF THE SHOPPING MALLS, SO THERE'S A DEARTH OF, YOU KNOW, PARKING. PEOPLE DO DRIVE, WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT. THAT'S THE REALITY. AND SO I THINK, YOU KNOW, THESE SPOTS ARE GOING TO BE GRABBED, JUST LIKE WHAT WE SEE HAS BEEN OCCURRING ON, AGAIN, THAT STRETCH OF HURON PARKWAY BETWEEN NIXON AND PLYMOUTH FOREVER, SINCE THAT PARKING WAS CREATED ON HURON PARKWAY, AND I KNOW -- I HAVE BEEN TOLD OVER THE YEARS THAT THAT'S -- THOSE ARE BASICALLY COMMUTERS, YOU KNOW, AND THEY DRIVE IN, PARK THERE, CATCH THE BUS, AND GO WHEREVER. SO, I THINK WE ARE GOING TO HAVE SIMILAR CHALLENGES ON TRAVERWOOD, FRANKLY. SO, I WOULD JUST ASK US TO REACH OUT TO ALL OF THESE FOLKS WHO HAVE BEEN WRITING US WHO, YOU KNOW, EXPRESSED SUPPORT, BECAUSE THEY ALL THINK THEY CAN PARK THERE TOO.
03:58:11.365: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
03:58:12.433: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  SORRY TO DRAG THE DEBATE ON, BUT I JUST WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE ISLAMIC COMMUNITY WAS UNDER THE ASSUMPTION THAT THIS WAS GOING TO BE EXCLUSIVE PARKING FOR THEM. THIS IS AN ARGUMENT THAT IS BEING MADE UP HERE AT THE TABLE. I HAVE NOT SEEN ANYTHING TO MAKE ME BELIEVE THEY THOUGHT THIS WAS GOING TO BE EXCLUSIVELY FOR THEIR USE, AND AS WE TRY TO ENCOURAGE OTHER MODES OF TRANSPORTATION AND HAVING THIS BE USED FOR COMMUTERS, THAT'S FINE. I MEAN, IT'S A PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY, AND IF WE WANT TO LATER REGULATE IT, WE CAN, BUT WE NEED TO MAKE A DECISION, AND WE NEED TO MOVE ON, AND THANK YOU.
03:59:08.489: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  I GUESS -- MR. LAZARUS?
03:59:12.894: >> CITY ADMIN. LAZARUS:  I WOULD ADDRESS THE SCHEDULING OF WHAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO DO WITH RESURFACING, BECAUSE WINTER WILL BE UPON US BEFORE WE KNOW IT.
03:59:20.201: >> YEAH, JUST AS A REMINDER, THE REASON WHY GREEN AND TRAVERWOOD WERE IN CONSIDERATION IN PARTICULAR FOR ROAD DIETS IS BECAUSE THEY WERE A PART OF THIS CONSTRUCTION SEASON, WHICH IS RAPIDLY DRAWING TO A CLOSE. WE'LL DISCUSS IT IN A MOMENT, BUT I AM SURE AS YOU HAVE NOTICED ON GREEN, GREEN WAS PAVED THE WEEKEND BEFORE LAST. TRAVERWOOD WILL MEET A SIMILAR FATE SOON. REALLY IT'S HOW DO WE STRIPE IT. IF PARKING IS A CONSIDERATION, THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF MOVEMENT OF THE CURB AS WELL. SO THE SOONER WE GET DIRECTION FROM COUNCIL,THE MORE APT WE ARE TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THAT THIS CONSTRUCTION CYCLE.
04:00:02.777: >> CITY ADMIN. LAZARUS:  SO WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO ADD IF I COULD, AND MAYBE AT A CERTAIN HAZARD, IS STAFF DID A LOT OF COORDINATION WHEN WE BROUGHT THE ORIGINAL CONFIGURATION BACK, INCLUDING TALKING TO THE USERS OF THE STREET. I THINK THE QUESTION THAT WAS ASKED, WHEN IT WAS BROUGHT BEFORE ABOUT PUTTING BIKE LANES, I THINK THE COMMENT WAS WE COULD DO IT. IT DOESN'T AFFECT THE MOVEMENT OF TRAFFIC. YOU KNOW, I PERSONALLY LIKE BIKE LANES, BUT I ALSO DON'T LIKE THE IDEA OF PARKING IN BIKE LANES, SO AT THIS POINT, HEARING ALL OF THE COMMENTS, THE MANY PEOPLE THAT SHOWED UP THIS EVENING, MY RECOMMENDATION WOULD BE TO GO BACK TO THE ORIGINAL DESIGN AND PUT PARKING ON ONE SIDE AND JUST GO FORWARD WITH IT. SOMETIMES THE SIMPLEST SOLUTION IS THE BEST.
04:00:48.623: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION ON THE AMENDMENT? FOR MY PART, I WOULD BE WILLING TO VOTE DOWN THE AMENDMENT AND VOTE IN FAVOR OF THE RESOLUTION AS WAS, WHICH HAD BEEN VETTED WITH USERS. I HAVE GOT COUNCILMEMBER EATON AND THEN GRISWOLD.
04:01:12.980: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  I WOULD BE WILLING TO POSTPONE THIS TO GRANT STAFF THE TIME TO TALK TO THE INTERESTED PARTIES. THERE'S STRIPES. YOU KNOW, THE PAVEMENT IS GOING TO BE DONE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER, AND I REALLY BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULDN'T BE TAKING ON THE BURDEN OF PROVIDING PARKING TO ALL OF THE PRIVATE ENTITIES ON THAT ROAD. I DO UNDERSTAND THAT THE MOSQUE HAS A FLUCTUATING DEMAND FOR PARKING, AND I'M WILLING TO BE FLEXIBLE, YOU KNOW, WITH THEM FOR THEIR PEAK EVENTS, BUT I WOULD PREFER TO HAVE THE TWO BIKE LANES, BUT IF THE WAY WE GET THERE IS TO ENGAGE IN CONVERSATION, I THINK THAT'S AN APPROPRIATE THING, SO I WOULD SUPPORT THE POSTPONEMENT. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT GOOD GOVERNMENT IS SYNONYMOUS WITH QUICK DECISIONS. I THINK DELIBERATION IS APPROPRIATE TO GET TO THE RIGHT DECISION, SO I WILL SUPPORT YOUR MOTION TO POSTPONE.
04:02:22.650: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD?
04:02:23.718: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD: WHATEVER WE DO, I THINK IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE ENSURE THAT THERE IS PARKING FOR THE ISLAMIC CENTER, FOR THEIR EVENTS, JUST LIKE WE DO FOR CHURCHES AND SYNAGOGUES, SO, TO GO FORWARD WITH PARKING ON THE STREET AND THEN TO SAY, OH, TOO BAD, IT'S FILLED UP WITH COMMUTERS I DON'T THINK IS MEETING THEIR NEEDS, SO I'M WILLING TO VOTE FOR THE POSTPONEMENT, BUT I THINK THAT WE NEED TO KEEP IN MIND THE PROBLEM THAT WE NEED TO SOLVE, AND THAT IS PARKING FOR THE ISLAMIC CENTER, AND WE ARE NOT IN THE PARKING BUSINESS FOR ANY OF THE OTHER ENTITIES ALONG TRAVERWOOD, AND SO I'M NOT CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR NEEDS.
04:03:09.396: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  IF WE GOT AN ANSWER TO YOU BY THE NEXT COUNCIL MEETING, WOULD THAT BE IN TIME?
04:03:16.504: >> IT WOULD HAVE TO BE.
04:03:19.740: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  WELL, TIME WAITS FOR NO ONE. WOULD IT BE IN TIME BEFORE THE COLD COMES. DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
04:03:25.279: >> YEAH, THE FIRST MEETING IN SEPTEMBER -- SECOND MEETING IN SEPTEMBER, WE ARE STILL WITHIN THE CONSTRUCTION WINDOW. ONE THING THAT I WOULD LIKE DIRECTION FROM COUNCIL ON IS IF THERE IS A POSTPONEMENT AND WE ARE TO GO BACK AND SEEK, YOU KNOW, INFORMATION FROM THE INTERESTED STAKEHOLDERS, IF SOMEONE COULD OUTLINE WHAT THAT REPORT BACK LOOKS LIKE.
04:03:49.737: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  SURE.
04:03:50.604: >> IS IT JUST WE HAD A CONVERSATION AND THIS IS WHAT WE HEARD? OR ARE WE SUPPOSED TO CONVINCE THE MERITS OF ONE OVER THE OTHER? I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO PUT IN THAT REPORT.
04:04:01.582: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  HERE'S MY SENSE TO THE ROOM, AND I THINK -- I SENSE A GENERAL -- WITH SOME DISSENT, I SENSE A GENERAL WILLINGNESS TO HAVE THIS POSTPONED TO THE NEXT MEETING. AT THIS NEXT MEETING, I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR A REPORT BACK FROM STAFF. STAFF HAS PREVIOUSLY WORKED WITH THE ISLAMIC CENTER, AND THEY SUPPORTED VERSION ONE. THERE HAS BEEN A MOVE TO PUT IN BIKE LANES ON BOTH SIDES. SOME PEOPLE ON COUNCIL, AND PERHAPS STAFF, BELIEVES THAT THAT ACTUALLY IS A BETTER SOLUTION FOR THE PARKING CENTER, BECAUSE IT REDUCES COMPETITION. IF THE ISLAMIC CENTER, FOR MY PART, CAME TO SUPPORT THAT AS WELL, THAT WOULD BE AN IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR ME, AND SO I WOULD WANT STAFF TO COME BACK WITH A REPORT OF THE CONVERSATION THAT THEY HAD WITH THE ISLAMIC CENTER, THAT THE ISLAMIC CENTER REPORTS SUPPORT FOR THE -- FOR A TWO-BIKE LANE SOLUTION, AND WE CAN TAKE IT FROM THERE, IF THAT CAME TO PASS. IF THEY PREFER IT TO BE VERSION ONE, WELL, THAT WOULD BE IMPORTANT. THAT WOULD BE, FOR MY PART, DETERMINATIVE, BUT WE'D TAKE IT FROM THERE. DOES THAT SEEM LIKE A REASONABLE SOLUTION?
04:05:20.427: >> UH-HUH.
04:05:21.762: >> ALL RIGHT. DOES THAT SEEM LIKE A SOLUTION THAT CAN GET US TO A MOTION AND TO NEXT WEEK, AND TO NEXT TIME, IF SLIGHTLY UNREASONABLE? IS THE AMENDMENT WITHDRAWN FOR THE PURPOSE?
04:05:36.377: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  YES.

04:07:11.472: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  DS3, RESOLUTION TO PROCEED WITH A ROAD RECONFIGURATION PILOT FOR GREEN ROAD, FROM BURBANK DRIVE TO PLYMOUTH ROAD MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD. DISCUSSION, PLEASE, OF DS3. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
04:07:22.449: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I DID NOT SUPPORT THE ORIGINAL GREEN ROAD ROAD DIET PROPOSAL BECAUSE THE EXISTING TRAFFIC AND SAFETY CONDITIONS ON GREEN IMMEDIATELY NORTH OF PLYMOUTH ARE ALREADY PROBLEMATIC, AND A ROAD DIET PROPOSAL WOULD MAKE IT WORSE BY REDUCING TWO NORTHBOUND LANES ON GREEN NORTH OF PLYMOUTH TO ONE VEHICLE LANE AND BY NARROWING THE LANE. SINCE THIS TWEAKED PROPOSAL WE ARE LOOKING AT TONIGHT MAKES NO CHANGES TO WHAT WAS PROPOSED FOR THAT SECTION, I WON'T BE SUPPORTING THIS PROPOSAL EITHER. IN ANY EVENT, AS I SAID WITH TRAVERWOOD, ALTHOUGH I JUST SUPPORTED A POSTPONEMENT, I DO THINK IT'S TIME TO MAKE A DECISION HERE. WE HAVE BEEN DEBATING VARIOUS ROAD DIETS FOR MONTHS NOW. THEY HAVE BEEN ON THE COUNCIL AGENDA SEVERAL TIMES, AND THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION HAS REVIEWED THEM AT THREE OF THEIR MEETINGS, SO IT DOES SEEM LIKE IT'S TIME TO MAKE A DECISION. THE REALITY, OF COURSE, IS THAT ROAD DIETS ARE APPROPRIATE IN SOME CASES BUT NOT APPROPRIATE IN OTHERS. IN MY VIEW, GREEN ROAD, ESPECIALLY NEAR THE PLYMOUTH INTERSECTION, FALLS SQUARELY INTO THE LATTER, QUOTE, "NOT APPROPRIATE" UNQUOTE CATEGORY. LET'S GO BACK TO THE ORIGINAL STAFF REPORT OF MAY 13TH. IT LISTED FACTORS SUPPORTING AND DISCOURAGING ROAD DIETS FOR SEVERAL POSSIBLE ROAD DIET LOCATIONS. FOR MOST OF THE LOCATIONS, THERE WERE NOT MANY DISCOURAGING FACTORS JUST BEYOND TRAFFIC DELAYS. THERE WERE NONE FOR TRAVERWOOD. BUT THERE WERE SEVERAL DISCOURAGING FACTORS FOR GREEN, INCLUDING THE RETAIL AND OFFICE SPACES HAVE MULTIPLE DRIVEWAYS. THIS COULD BECOME A SOURCE OF FRICTION IF A LANE REDUCTION WERE IMPLEMENTED. THE ABUNDANCE OF RETAIL STORES ENSURES A HIGH VOLUME OF FREIGHT TRAFFIC. IF LANES WERE REDUCED, DRIVER PERCEIVED LEVEL OF  -- NIXON ROAD COULD BE AFFECTED BY VEHICLES AVOIDING THE NEW LANE CONFIGURATION. REMEMBER, THIS ISN'T JANE LUMM'S OPINION. THIS IS THE STAFF REPORT. DOES THIS SOUND TO YOU LIKE AN APPROPRIATE AREA AND SET OF CONDITIONS FOR A ROAD DIET? I SUSPECT NOT. THERE IS LOTS OF WORDS, LIKE FRICTION, CONFLICT, AND DISCOMFORT, WHICH IN PLAIN ENGLISH SOUND TO MOST FOLKS LIKE TRAFFIC SAFETY RISKS. INTERESTINGLY, ONE OF THE FACTORS SUPPORTING A ROAD DIET IS THAT THE PEAK HOUR DIRECTIONAL VOLUME ISN'T IDEAL BUT IS WITHIN AN ACCEPTABLE RANGE. TO BE CLEAR ON WHAT THAT MEANS, THE FEDERAL HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION GUIDELINES FOR VIABILITY OF ROAD DIETS IS LESS THAN 750 PEAK HOUR DIRECTIONAL VOLUME. THE ACTUAL VOLUME COUNT HERE IS 754 NOW. JUST ASK YOURSELF IF YOU THINK THE TRAFFIC IN NORTHEAST ANN ARBOR IS GOING TO INCREASE OR DECREASE FROM THAT 754 TODAY. I THINK YOU KNOW YOUR ANSWER TO THAT ONE TOO. THE NEIGHBORS AND FOLKS WHO USE THIS AREA FREQUENTLY UNDERSTAND ALL OF THIS. THEY RECOGNIZE THE CONDITIONS AND RECOGNIZE THE POTENTIAL PROBLEMS OF THE PROPOSED ROAD DIET. THEY ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT WITH THE CONTINUING BUILD-OUT OF NORTHEAST ANN ARBOR AND THE SPECIFIC DEVELOPMENT AT THE RED ROOF INN, THOSE CONDITIONS DISCOURAGING A ROAD DIET HERE ARE ONLY GOING TO INCREASE. THOSE FOLKS WHO USE THIS AREA AND UNDERSTAND THE DYNAMICS OF THE DECISION OPPOSE THE PLAN. WHILE NOT A HUGE SAMPLE SIZE, ONLY ABOUT 40, LESS THAN HALF OF THE RESPONDENTS SUPPORTED THE ROAD DIET PLAN OVERALL, AND LESS THAN ONE IN FIVE, 18% TO BE EXACT, SUPPORTED THE INTERSECTION PLAN. LASTLY, PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT THE "REVISED" PROPOSAL ON THE TABLE TONIGHT IS NOT MUCH DIFFERENT THAN THAT REJECTED A MONTH AGO ON AUGUST 5TH. IT DOES NOT AT ALL ADDRESS THE PRIMARY CONCERN OR MAKE ANY CHANGES IN THE AREA IMMEDIATELY NORTH OF PLYMOUTH. AS YOU CONSIDER YOUR ROAD, I WOULD ASK YOU TO REMEMBER THAT COUNCIL CAN BE SUPPORTIVE OF VISION ZERO AS A CONCEPT AND ROAD DIETS AS TOOLS AND AT THE SAME TIME RECOGNIZE THERE ARE JUST SOME ROADS AND SECTIONS WHERE ROAD DIETS ARE JUST NOT APPROPRIATE. WITH THAT UNDERSTANDING, ASK YOURSELF IF YOU REALLY BELIEVE WHAT'S PROPOSED HERE SPECIFICALLY FOR THIS BUSY AREA OF GREEN AND PLYMOUTH IS APPROPRIATE. AS I MENTIONED LAST MEETING, IT'S ILL-ADVISED TO TRY AND FORCE AN APPLICATION OF ANY CONCEPT, NO MATTER HOW MUCH WE BELIEVE IN A CONCEPT WHERE IT JUST DOESN'T FIT. IN MY VIEW, THAT'S WHAT WE ARE BEING ASKED TO DO WITH THIS ROAD DIET ON GREEN, AND FOR ALL OF THOSE REASONS CITED IN THE STAFF REPORT I MENTIONED EARLIER, I THINK THE PROPOSAL MAY VERY WELL RESULT IN MORE SAFETY RISKS THAN IMPROVEMENTS AND SHOULD BE REJECTED TONIGHT. AND THANK YOU FOR LISTENING.
04:12:37.698: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER SMITH?
04:12:38.865: >> COUNCILMEMBER SMITH:  I WOULD SIMPLY LIKE TO POINT OUT IT'S 11:15. WE HAVE POTENTIALLY ANOTHER ITEM ON THE AGENDA THAT WILL GENERATE DISCUSSION AS WELL AS A LENGTHY CLOSED SESSION ON THE SCHEDULE THIS EVENING. I WOULD HOPE THAT WE COULD MOVE THIS ALONG FAIRLY QUICKLY.
04:12:53.880: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
04:12:58.552: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD: AFTER WE VOTED THIS DOWN, I IMMEDIATELY CONTACTED THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR THE NEXT DAY ABOUT SOME CONCERNS. WE MET TWICE, AND I APPRECIATE EVERYTHING THAT THE EXISTING STAFF HAVE DONE. HOWEVER, THERE SEEMS TO BE AN OPERATIONAL ANALYSIS THAT IS MISSING, AND I KNOW I HARP ON THIS ALL THE TIME, AND HOPEFULLY IT WILL BE SUCCESSFUL THAT WE'LL GET THIS OPERATIONS MANAGER, BECAUSE I LIVE NEAR THAT AREA. IT IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS, AND WE REALLY DON'T HAVE A ROAD DIET CONCEPT AT THE INTERSECTION BECAUSE THE PROPOSAL IS FOR ONE NORTHBOUND LANE AND THEN TWO DEDICATED LEFT TURN SOUTHBOUND LANES, SO YOU DON'T HAVE THE OPTION OF A SHARED MIDDLE LANE, AND I'M NOT GOING TO GET INTO THE WEEDS ABOUT THIS, BUT THERE ARE SOME REAL CONCERNS WITH THAT. THERE IS ALSO A FACTUAL ERROR IN THE REPORT, AND I POINTED THAT OUT, BUT IT STILL EXISTS. SOUTH OF PLYMOUTH ROAD ON GREEN ROAD, THE BIKE LANE DOES NOT GO TO THE INTERSECTION. IT STOPS A FEW HUNDRED FEET BEFORE THE INTERSECTION, BECAUSE IT'S NOT SAFE TO RIDE -- TO HAVE A BIKE LANE GOING ACROSS THAT INTERSECTION. PEOPLE ARE MAKING LEFT-HAND TURNS, TWO LANES OF THEM. I SWEAR, 40-50 MILES AN HOUR TRYING TO GET ON US 23. THESE ARE OPERATIONAL ISSUES, AND I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE SECOND WARD THAT THIS WILL RESULT IN MORE CRASHES, NOT FEWER. BUT BACK TO THE CONCEPT OF WE HAVE TO CONTINUE THE BIKE LANE, THE BIKE LANE DOES NOT EXIST ON GREEN ROAD JUST SOUTH OF PLYMOUTH ROAD FOR A FEW HUNDRED FEET, AND SO WHY WE ARE TRYING TO ADD IT IMMEDIATELY AT THE INTERSECTION I DON'T KNOW. THERE IS NO BIKE LANE AT THAT INTERSECTION. THANK YOU.
04:15:02.209: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  MR. HESS?
04:15:05.111: >> SO, COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD IS CORRECT. THE BIKE LANE, AS IS OFTEN FOUND THROUGHOUT THE CITY, WHERE WE DROP THE BIKE LANE AT THE APPROACH TO THE INTERSECTION. HOWEVER, THERE WAS A LEFT TURN LANE REMOVED ON THE NORTHBOUND SECTION OF GREEN, SO THERE IS A GORED OUT AREA, A HASHED PAINTED AREA THAT COULD BE REMOVED EASILY TO MAKE ROOM FOR BOTH A RECEIVING BIKE LANE ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE INTERSECTION AND A NORTHBOUND LANE UP TO THE INTERSECTION. AND TO CLARIFY ANOTHER POINT, ON THE SOUTHBOUND APPROACH ON GREEN TOWARDS PLYMOUTH, THERE IS A DEDICATED THROUGH BIKE LANE. THAT IS ACTUALLY BUFFERED. GRANTED, IT'S A SMALL BUFFER WITH ALL OF THE DIFFERENT THINGS WE ARE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH, BUT SO, YOU KNOW, THE IDEA IS IF A CYCLIST IS GOING FROM THE EXISTING BIKE PATH THAT'S ON GREEN ALREADY DOWN TO THE SECTION, TO THE EXISTING BIKE LANE -- I'M SORRY, TO THE BIKE LANE NORTH OF HERE TO THE EXISTING BIKE LANE SOUTH OF HERE, THERE IS AN EXISTING LANE UP TO THAT INTERSECTION AND THERE COULD BE A SOUTH ONE AS WELL WITH REPURPOSING THAT GORE AREA.
04:16:08.475: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE PLEASE -- PARDON ME, COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
04:16:16.683: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. A BIG THANKS TO STAFF FOR THEIR INCREMENTAL WORK ON THIS. I THINK WHEN CITY COUNCIL TOOK ON THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR REVIEWING AND APPROVING THESE ROAD RECONFIGURATIONS, WE TOOK ON THE BURDEN OF LOOKING TO MAKE ITERATIVE CHANGE IF WE DIDN'T LIKE THE FIRST VERSION. I THINK THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE ARE DOING, AND STAFF HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY RESPONSIVE, SO I APPRECIATE THAT. I THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE A PAIN POINT AT GREEN AND PLYMOUTH SOUTHBOUND. THERE IS. AND WHAT THIS SERVES TO DO IS TO PRESERVE ALL OF THOSE TURN LANES WHILE PUTTING IN PLACE A FUTURE CONDUIT TO A CONNECTED BIKE NETWORK, AND I THINK THAT'S A GOOD THING. I DON'T THINK THERE IS GOING TO BE A SOLUTION IN WHICH ALL 300 MILES OF OUR ROADWAY HAVE A BIKE LANE OVERNIGHT, AND IT'S UNFORTUNATELY, TO SOME EXTENT, IT'S GOING TO BE ONE SECTION AT A TIME, AS WE REPAVE AND RECONFIGURE, AND I THINK THIS MOVES THE NEEDLE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND WILL KEEP CARS TURNING WHERE THEY NEED TO AND REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF -- WELL, I SHOULD SAY WILL KEEP STEADY THE AMOUNT OF GRIDLOCK THAT PEOPLE EXPERIENCE NOW. WE SEE AN AVERAGE INCREASE OF 11 SECONDS OF WAIT TIME.
04:17:42.202: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
04:17:45.805: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD:  I LOOKED UP THE WORD PILOT. WHY WE ARE PILOTING ROAD RECONSTRUCTION, I DON'T UNDERSTAND, AND I'M SORRY IF I'M A LITTLE BIT UPSET, BUT I HAVE LIVED THROUGH NUMEROUS FATALITIES ON OUR ROADWAYS AND SERIOUS INCAPACITATED INJURIES. TO BE PILOTING AND SAYING, LET'S JUST TRY IT OUT FOR A WHILE, IS WRONG, AND I WOULD WISH THAT MY COUNCILMEMBERS WOULD TAKE THE LEAD -- WOULD FOLLOW THE LEAD OF THE SECOND WARD. A VOTE YES ON THIS IS A VOTE TO INCREASE PEDESTRIAN AND CYCLING AND VEHICLE CRASHES. WE ARE SPENDING $400,000 ON VISION ZERO, AND WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO INCREASE OUR CRASHES, AND I AM VERY, VERY TROUBLED.
04:18:44.631: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER LUMM AND THEN HAYNER?
04:18:48.468: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  I CONCUR WITH WHAT MY COUNCIL COLLEAGUE JUST STATED, AND THIS IS THE INTERSECTION WHERE STAFF REPORTED THAT WE HAVE FREQUENT REAR END CRASHES, FREQUENT CRASHES. AND I SENT YOU A PHOTO THAT I TOOK LAST WEEK OF WHAT WILL OCCUR WHEN THIS IS DIETED TO ONE LANE GOING NORTH. THE PHOTO ILLUSTRATED THAT CARS WERE USING THE OTHER LANE TO PASS THE BUS THAT'S PARKED NEAR THIS INTERSECTION. THEY HAVE GOT TO HAVE A PLACE TO GO. SO, COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD AND I KNOW THIS AREA WELL, AND THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THIS IS A LESS SAFE -- AGAIN, DON'T TAKE MY WORD FOR IT. I WOULD REFER YOU TO THAT MAY STAFF REPORT, AND IF YOU'RE OUT THERE OFTEN ENOUGH, YOU SEE -- YOU SEE HOW THIS WILL ALL PLAY OUT, AND I -- THIS IS A BIG DEAL FOR THESE FOLKS, I KNOW. APPARENTLY, SOME DON'T WANT TO DISCUSS IT OR ARE IRRITATED THAT WE ARE SPENDING TIME DISCUSSING THIS. MAYBE JUST ONE PERSON HERE AT THIS TABLE, AND I THINK THAT'S UNFORTUNATE, BECAUSE THIS IS -- THIS IS A QUALITY OF LIFE ISSUE IN SO MANY RESPECTS, BUT PRIMARILY IT'S A SAFETY ISSUE, AND THIS DOES NOT ADDRESS THE SAFETY CONCERNS THAT OUR STAFF NOTED AND BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION.
04:20:31.538: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
04:20:32.672: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. SO THE IDEA THAT WE ARE SLOWLY BUILDING OUT THIS TRANSPORTATION NETWORK IS, YOU KNOW, IT'S THE RIGHT IDEA, BUT I AM NOT SURE IT'S THE RIGHT SOLUTION IN THIS PLACE. I JUST GOT BACK FROM A WEEKEND OF DRIVING A MOTOR VEHICLE THROUGH MANHATTAN, AND FORTUNATELY I HAD MY DEDICATED WIFE NAVIGATING WHILE I LOOKED OUT FOR THE INSANITY THAT IS NEW YORK CITY TRAFFIC. AND NEW YORK CITY HAS PUT MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO THEIR VISION ZERO, AND IT'S ANYBODY'S GUESS AS TO WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE LANE MARKINGS. THERE'S ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT ARROWS, BUSSES HAVE THEIR OWN COLOR, BIKE LANES HAVE A COLOR, AND NOBODY CARES ABOUT ANY OF THAT. THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ANN ARBOR, SO IT'S NOT REALLY A POINT, BUT I DIDN'T SEE ANY CYCLISTS FOLLOWING ANY RULES, GOING THE WRONG WAY DOWN AN AVENUE THAT IS ONE WAY. I'M CONCERNED ABOUT OUR EXPERIMENTATION, THE IDEA THAT THIS IS A PILOT, AND THE PILOT SHOWS SOME KIND OF PROGRESSIVE ATTITUDE TO WORK TOWARDS VISION ZERO, BUT WE HAVE OTHER PILOT THINGS THAT ARE TO ME JUST MADNESS, LIKE WE HAVE THIS THING ON 5th AND BEAKS, WHERE WE CLOSED OFF A LANE. WHAT IT'S DOING, IT ALMOST WIPED ME ON MY SCOOTER WHEN IT'S RAINING, BECAUSE IT'S A GRITTED FILL-IN BUT STILL LIKE AN ICE RINK IN THE RAIN BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH PAINT. IT'S PUSHING OUT CARS, BUT THEY ARE GOING INTO THE OTHER LANE WHERE THE PRESCHOOL BUS DROP-OFF IS. THEY ARE GOING SLOWER SO THEY WON'T HIT THE KIDS GETTING OUT OF THE BUS. I DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT CAME FROM. I STOPPED AND HAD A CONVERSATION WITH STAFF THE OTHER DAY. SO, I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THIS. I BELIEVE THAT EVERYBODY IN THIS CITY HAS THE RIGHT TO GO SAFELY FROM POINT A TO POINT B. BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT WE ALL HAVE TO DO IT ON THE SAME PIECE OF PAVEMENT, AND THAT'S WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO. WE ARE TRYING TO FORCE FIT THESE SAFETY ROUTES, THESE CONTIGUOUS ROUTES, AND ONE OF THE TENANTS OF VISION ZERO, OF ACCEPTING THIS NOTION, WHICH IS A PROPER NOTION, THAT WE CAN MAKE IMPROVEMENTS, IS TO LOOK AT THE WORST PLACES FIRST, AND THERE ARE SO MANY WORSE PLACES WITH DISAPPEARING BIKE LANES AND NONCONTIGUOUS BIKE LANES AND BIG GAPS IN THE BIKES AND SIDEWALKS, BOTH ON AND OFF THE ROAD, THAT THIS JUST -- THIS JUST DOESN'T QUALIFY FOR ME AS A PRIORITY FOR RESTRIPING, AND, YOU KNOW, I WAS JUST DOWN THERE, AND IT'S A SHAME, BECAUSE I KNOW IT'S READY TO GO AND BE RESTRIPED, BUT I SEE THE SAME THING THAT COUNCILMEMBER LUMM AND GRISWOLD SEE, THAT, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE GOT BUS STOPS ALL UP AND DOWN HERE AND CARS TO GO AROUND, AND I'M NOT SEEING THIS AS A SAFE ADDITION TO OUR INFRASTRUCTURE.
04:23:51.504: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI -- OH, COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
04:23:54.474: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRAND:  THANK YOU. THIS CONVERSATION HURTS MY HEAD FOR A LOT OF REASONS. ONE, BECAUSE IT'S INCREDIBLY INSULTING TO OUR STAFF TO IMPLY THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO MAKE US LESS SAFE WITH THEIR PLANS TO MAKE THESE ROAD IMPROVEMENTS. THE REASON WE ARE WORKING ON THIS ROAD NOW AND THE REASON THAT THIS IS COMING FORWARD IS BECAUSE WE HAVE TO STRIPE IT ONE WAY OR ANOTHER, SO THIS IS NOT A COST ISSUE. THIS IS NOT ABOUT A RESOURCE ALLOCATION ISSUE, OTHER THAN STAFF TIME AND STAFF TIME AND STAFF TIME. THIS IS ANOTHER BANANAS EXAMPLE. IT REALLY IS, AND THERE IS -- TO JUST MAKE EXCUSES FOR NOT SUPPORTING STAFF RECOMMENDATIONS TIME AND TIME AGAIN, BUT IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO -- I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE IF WE COULD NOT INSULT STAFF IN THE PROCESS. MR. HESS IS HERE WITH US AT 11:30 AT NIGHT. I KNOW HIS INTENT AND HIS COLLEAGUES' INTENT IS CERTAINLY NOT TO MAKE PEOPLE IN OUR CITY LESS SAFE, SO THANK YOU FOR THE WORK THAT YOU DO. I APOLOGIZE IF THIS GOES DOWN, AND THAT'S ALL I HAVE GOT TO SAY.
04:25:07.380: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
04:25:08.314: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  YEAH, THANK YOU. AND I JUST HAVE A QUESTION, AND I'M SORRY I HAVE TO ASK IT. I SHOULD KNOW THIS, BUT WITH ALL OF THE CONVERSATIONS, I LOST TRACK OF EVERYTHING. THE PROPOSED RECONFIGURATION, WE WERE GIVEN THE EXISTING, AND THEN WE WERE GIVEN PROPOSED OPTION A, OPTION B, EVEN THOUGH IT SEEMS TO BE JUST ONE OPTION, AND THEN OPTION C. IN THIS RESOLUTION, WHICH OPTION ARE WE GOING FOR? IS THE PROPOSED OPTION A AND B OR THE DEFEATED OPTION C, IF I COULD GET JUST...
04:25:55.695: >> YES, COUNCILMEMBER. THE OPTION THAT YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU IS KIND OF A MODIFIED OPTION C, SO SOME OF THE TWEAKS THAT WERE MADE FROM LAST TIME TO THIS TIME ARE GREEN FROM -- GREEN AT PLYMOUTH MAINTAINS THE PREVIOUSLY PROPOSED CONFIGURATION, SO THE NORTHBOUND TRAVEL LANE, THE NORTHBOUND BUFFERED BIKE LANE, SOUTHBOUND RIGHT TURN LANE, SOUTHBOUND THROUGH LANE, SOUTHBOUND DUAL LEFTS AND A SOUTHBOUND BUFFERED BIKE LANE. SO, HERE ARE THE CHANGES THOUGH. SO, GREEN FROM PLYMOUTH TO COMMONWEALTH ADDED BACK IN A SOUTHBOUND TRAVEL LANE. NORTH -- NO, IT'S EXTENDED FURTHER. IT'S EXTENDED ALL THE WAY UP TO COMMONWEALTH NOW. BEFORE, IT HAD TAPERED EARLIER. SO, THE NORTHBOUND TRAVEL LANE AND NORTHBOUND BUFFER BIKE LANE, THOSE PARTS ARE THE SAME. GREEN AT COMMONWEALTH ADDED A SOUTHBOUND RIGHT TURN LANE. GREEN FROM COMMONWEALTH TO BURBANK MAINTAINS THE SAME CONFIGURATION. GREEN AT BURBANK ADDED A NORTHBOUND RIGHT TURN LANE, SO, ULTIMATELY WHAT HAPPENED IS, YOU KNOW, THERE WAS -- FOR THE SOUTHBOUND -- SO OUR OBSERVATION IN THE DATA SHOWS THAT THE HEAVIEST TRAFFIC FLOW IS SOUTHBOUND GREEN APPROACHING THE PLYMOUTH INTERSECTION, SO WE MAINTAINED ALL OF THAT INTERSECTION CONFIGURATION FOR VEHICLES AT THAT APPROACH, AND THEN WE EVEN EXTENDED FROM THE ORIGINAL C TO WHAT THE NEW REVISED C IS WE EXTENDED KIND OF THAT SECOND-LANE APPROACH ALL THE WAY FROM COMMONWEALTH ALL THE WAY SOUTH TO PLYMOUTH. I KNOW I'M KIND OF TALKING AND IT'S KIND OF HARD TO VISUALIZE THESE THINGS, AND THEN WE ADDED SOME TURN LANES AT COMMONWEALTH AND BURBANK.
04:27:42.902: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  THE STICKING POINT, THE POINT OF HOURS AND HOURS OF DELIBERATION HAS BEEN THE NORTHBOUND LANE NORTH OF PLYMOUTH ROAD, AND WHAT I'M LOOKING AT NOW, I'M UNFORTUNATELY CONFUSED. I'M LOOKING AT A COUPLE OF SCENARIOS WHERE THERE IS JUST ONE NORTHBOUND TRAFFIC AND ONE BIKE LANE.
04:28:06.525: >> THAT'S CORRECT.
04:28:07.393: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  AND THEN THERE'S ANOTHER SCENARIO. THERE'S TWO LANES OF NORTHBOUND TRAFFIC AND A BIKE LANE.
04:28:12.598: >> THE OPTION BEFORE YOU IS THE ONE THAT IS THE ONE LANE NORTHBOUND TRAFFIC FOR VEHICULAR TRAFFIC AND A BIKE LANE.
04:28:24.577: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER SMITH. SMITH?
04:28:29.715: >> COUNCILMEMBER SMITH:  YES. RAMLAWI?

DS7, RESOLUTION AUTHORIZING PUBLICATION OF NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE GENERAL OBLIGATION CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT BONDS TO FUND DOWNTOWN DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY ANN ASHLEY PARKING STRUCTURE EXPANSION PROJECT (NOT TO EXCEED $27 MILLION) MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD, SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN. DISCUSSION, PLEASE, OF DS7. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
04:30:37.042: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  I JUST HAVE A QUESTION ON THE ADDITIONAL $4 MILLION THAT IS BEING ASKED, IF SUSAN PALE IS HERE FROM THE DDA TO HELP EXPLAIN THE COST ON THAT. YOU KNOW, I UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL MEETING SPACE, AND I KNOW THE LEASE IS UP AT THE CURRENT OFFICES IN A COUPLE OF YEARS, BUT I'M JUST STUNNED BY THE COST ESTIMATES TO BUILD OUT ON LAND THAT WE ALREADY OWN. THERE'S NO LAND ACQUISITION COSTS, AND THE SQUARE FOOTAGE I THINK WAS ABOUT 8,500 SQUARE FEET FOR THE PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT AT A TUNE OF $4 MILLION. ROUGH ESTIMATE, THAT'S ABOUT $470 A SQUARE FOOT TO BUILD, WHICH I THINK, YOU KNOW, THAT'S ABOUT WHAT IT COSTS TO BUILD A LUXURY CONDOMINIUM, INCLUDING LAND COSTS. COULD YOU EXPLAIN WHY THERE IS SUCH A HIGH COST ASSOCIATED WITH THIS PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT?
04:31:50.282: >> SURE. SO, THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS ARE, AS YOU SAID, EXCLUDING LAND. WE ARE EFFECTIVELY BUILDING A NEW BUILDING WITHIN THE SPACE THAT IS SURROUNDED BY THE GARAGE, INCLUDING EXISTING COLUMNS. SO, EVERYTHING THAT'S BEING DONE AT THIS SITE INCLUDES WHAT A BUILDING WOULD NEED. WE ARE GOING TO BE ADDING WALLS. WE ARE GOING TO BE ADDING UTILITIES. WE ARE DOING ALL OF THE STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS, INCLUDING SEPARATING IT FROM THE GARAGE, SO THAT IT'S WATER TIGHT, IT'S SOUND TIGHT, AND SO FORTH. SO, IT'S GOT THE CHALLENGES OF A NEW BUILDING, BUT AN ADDED CHALLENGE, BECAUSE IT'S WITHIN A FOOTPRINT THAT'S ALREADY PRESCRIBED. IN A GREENFIELD SETTING, BUILDING A BUILDING, WE HAVE GOT A LOT OF ELBOW ROOM. THE COSTS ARE GOING TO BE DIFFERENT THAN IT IS IN A PROSCRIBED FOOTPRINT. JUST AS YOU SAID, WE ALREADY OWN IT, BUT WE ARE GOING TO BE BUILDING ON A SITE THAT HAS COLUMNS ALL AROUND IT, AND WE ALREADY KNOW WHAT THE CEILING HEIGHT IS, AND WITHIN THAT, WE ARE GOING TO BE BUILDING A BUILDING IN A BUILDING.
04:32:56.515: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  ARE THERE ANY COST ESTIMATES FOR THE ONGOING CARRYING COSTS OF OPERATING A BUILDING THERE? I KNOW WE PAY RENT ACROSS THE STREET, BUT WHAT ARE ONGOING COSTS IN OPERATING, AND THEN, FURTHER, WHAT IS THE CURRENT AGREEMENT WITH REPUBLIC PARKING? DO WE CURRENTLY OFFER THEM SPACE? IS IT PART OF THE CONTRACT THAT WE HAVE THEM? IS IT PART OF OUR OPERATING AGREEMENT WITH PUBLIC PARKING TO PROVIDE THEM AN OFFICE SPACE?
04:33:29.815: >> THIS IS BEYOND OFFICE SPACE. WHAT WE ARE OFFERING IN THIS SPACE IS ALSO CUSTOMER SERVICE. WE ARE LOOKING TO HAVE A PLACE WHERE OUR CUSTOMERS WILL COME WHEN THEY HAVE GOT A QUESTION, A PARKING ISSUE, LOOKING TO APPLY FOR A JOB. THE ELEMENTS OF THAT CUSTOMER SERVICE OFFICE WOULD BE MOVED OVER TO THIS LOCATION. THERE ARE SOME ADMIN THERE WHO ARE DOING ACCOUNTING AS EACH CASHIER IS FINISHED WITH THEIR SHIFT. THEY ARE AUDITED. THERE IS ALL OF THIS GOING ON THAT IS PART OF THE ADMIN. THIS WOULD BE WHERE OUR PARKING OPERATOR GENERAL MANAGER WOULD OPERATE. THIS WOULD BE HIS OFFICE AS WELL. THE PRIMARY BENEFIT TO THIS LOCATION IS MORE ELBOW ROOM FOR THE CUSTOMER SERVICE DESK. RIGHT NOW AT MAYNARD, IT'S FAIRLY SPACE CONSTRAINED. WE HAVE POINTS WHEN CUSTOMERS HAVE TO WAIT OUTSIDE THE OFFICE TO GET IN TO TALK TO PEOPLE. WHAT WE ARE LOOKING TO DO IS TO CREATE A SPACE WHERE PEOPLE CAN FEEL A LITTLE BIT MORE ROOM WHEN THEY ARE ACTUALLY WORKING WITH MEMBERS OF THE REPUBLIC STAFF.
04:34:35.914: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  WELL, I CAN APPRECIATE THAT, BUT, AGAIN, THE PRICE TAG IS PRETTY ALARMING. IS IT PART OF THE CONTRACT THAT WE HAD WITH REPUBLIC GARAGE OR REPUBLIC PARKING TO PROVIDE THEM WITH THE OFFICE SPACE?
04:34:47.760: >> I'LL HAVE TO LOOK AT THAT. IT'S BEEN SUCH A LONG TIME THAT WE HAVE HAD THE CONTRACT. I DON'T KNOW. I'LL HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ABOUT THAT.
04:34:56.468: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  MY OTHER QUESTION PERTAINS TO THE FACT THAT SOME OF THESE WHEREAS CLAUSES REFER TO 2017, AND IN 2017, WE WERE IN NEGOTIATIONS WITH CORE TO LEASE OUT 350 SPACES FROM OUR SYSTEM. THAT DEAL HAS FALLEN THROUGH. IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S GOING THROUGH. SO, THE IMMEDIATE NEED THAT WE HAD IN 2017 UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES IS NO LONGER PRESENT. I JUST QUESTION THE NEED FOR THE THREE ADDITIONAL PARKING SPACES, CONSIDERING THE -- THE FACT THAT THE CONDITIONS THAT EXISTED UNDER -- IN 2017 ARE NO LONGER THERE RIGHT NOW, AND AGAIN, I JUST QUESTION WITH SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT WERE IN THE DOCUMENTS THAT, YOU KNOW, THIS COULD BE BUILT OUT LATER FOR SOMETHING ELSE IF DEMAND DECREASES. AGAIN, IT JUST SEEMS A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY, AND THIS IS -- $27 MILLION IS NOT CHUMP CHANGE. IN FACT, IT COULD PREVENT US FROM DOING OTHER THINGS IN THE FUTURE IF WE WISH TO LOOK AT OUR DEBT AND LOOK AT OUR RATING. SO, I JUST WOULD WANT TO THROW IT OUT THERE, AND I'LL RESERVE COMMENT. IF YOU WOULD LOVE TO RESPOND TO THAT, I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR THAT, BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE REST OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE TIME TO SPEAK AS WELL.
04:36:36.969: >> SO YOU SPEAK TO THE TIMELINE FOR THE PROJECT GOING BACK TO 2017. THE PROJECT BEGAN LESS CONNECTED TO THE CORE SPACES. IN FACT, IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CORE SPACES PROJECT. INSTEAD, AT THE POINT THAT YOU'RE MENTIONING, THE DDA HAD A SINGULAR FOCUS ON THE WESTERN END OF OUR DOWNTOWN. IF YOU LOOK AROUND DOWNTOWN, MUCH IS BUILT OUT. THE EXCEPTION IS THE WESTERN SIDE OF DOWNTOWN, WEST OF MAIN STREET, SO WE BEGAN WORK AT THAT POINT ON OUR 1st AND ASHLEY PROJECT, WHICH WAS INTENDED TO GUIDE THE PROJECT IN A MORE PEDESTRIAN FRIENDLY WAY. THE PROJECT HAS CONTINUED TO EVOLVE. IT WILL NOW INCLUDE AN EXTENSIVE AMOUNT OF INFRASTRUCTURE, INCLUDING THINGS LIKE WATER MAINS, ADDING ALL SORTS OF NEW SIDEWALK, ALL IN AREAS RIGHT NOW THAT DOESN'T HAVE A LOT, BUT AS AN INFRASTRUCTURE-BASED AGENCY, OUR HOPE IS TO SEE THE REDEVELOPMENT OF THAT PORTION OF DOWNTOWN. SO THE PARKING SPACES AT ANN ASHLEY ARE MUCH CONNECTED TO THAT EFFORT. THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY 300-350 SPACES IN THE PARKING LOT NEAR ANN AND ASHLEY. WE HOPE BY ADDING PUBLIC PARKING TO THIS GARAGE, WE CAN SEE THE PARCELS PUT TO MUCH HIGHER AND BETTER USES. THERE ARE PARKING LOTS TO THE EAST AND WEST OF IT, ALL OF WHICH SHOULD SEE SOME HIGHER USE THAN PARKING. AND IF WE CAN PUT 350 PARKING SPACES IN THE GARAGE, THEN WHEN THOSE PROJECTS COME DUE, IT'S A CHANCE TO SEE THOSE NONCAR USES PUT TO PLAY. SO, AGAIN, THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE ARE PUTTING IN PLACE IS A BET ON THE FUTURE. IT'S A BET THAT THE FUTURE OF DOWNTOWN WILL INCLUDE THIS SECTION, WHICH RIGHT NOW HASN'T THE CHARACTER OF THE AREAS EAST OF US, HASN'T THE BUILDING STOCK IN A LOT OF THE LOCATIONS, BUT WE ARE BETTING THAT IN THE FUTURE, WE ARE GOING TO SEE MORE OF THE GOOD STUFF, MORE RESIDENTS, MORE HOTEL GUESTS, MORE FESTIVALS AND EVENTS HAPPENING ON STREETS THAT ARE FILLED WITH ACTIVE BUSINESSES, SO THIS INVESTMENT IS ABOUT THAT FUTURE.
04:38:49.768: >> CITY ADMIN. LAZARUS:  IF I COULD ADD TO THAT, I WOULD ALSO ADD MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. COUNCIL HAS ASKED US TO USE A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO LOOK AT CITY PROPERTIES IN DOWNTOWN FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THERE IS A TRADEOFF WITH A LOSS OF PARKING AND THE NEED TO PROVIDE PARKING BEFORE IT BECOMES A CRISIS. THERE IS ALSO THE VERY REAL POTENTIAL LOSS OF PRIVATELY OWNED AND MANAGED SPACES IN THE DOWNTOWN AS WELL, SO I THINK THE PARKING DISCUSSION WAS WELL VETTED LAST YEAR WHEN WE MET IN THE COMBINED DVA BOARD CITY COUNCIL MEETING, SO THERE IS A DEMAND FOR THE SPACE.
04:39:29.608: >> IF I COULD JUST RESPOND TO THAT, THIS COUNCIL WAS NOT A PART OF THAT WORK SESSION. THAT HAPPENED BEFORE WE WERE SWORN IN, I BELIEVE, SO AS A WHOLE BODY, WE HAVE NOT WEIGHED IN ON IT, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, AND THAT AREA DOES PRESENT A LOT OF CHALLENGES, THE ALAN CREEK HAS A LOT OF CHALLENGES, AND AGAIN I WANT TO RESERVE TIME FOR MY COLLEAGUES. THANK YOU.
04:39:57.436: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
04:39:58.937: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I'LL JUST SAY THAT SOME OF YOUR PREDECESSORS WEREN'T CLUED IN ON THIS EITHER, COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI. I HAVE NO OTHER QUESTIONS. I APPRECIATE THE RESPONSES TO THE QUESTIONS THAT I SUBMITTED. SO THANK YOU FOR THAT. I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING THIS RESOLUTION TONIGHT, NOW THAT IT HAS BEEN EXPANDED BEYOND THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF ADDING PARKING CAPACITY TO THE ANN ASHLEY STRUCTURE. WE ARE NOW BEING ASKED TO SPEND $4 MILLION MORE TO ISSUE $4 MILLION MORE IN GENERAL CITY OBLIGATION BONDS TO PAY FOR THE BUILD-OUT OF THE SPACE UNDER THE EXISTING GARAGE FOR OFFICES AND MEETING SPACE. MY CONCERNS ARE WITH THE SUBSTANCE OF THE REVISION, AS WELL AS THE PROCESS THAT BROUGHT US TO THIS POINT, SO, FIRST, I'LL SPEAK TO THE PROCESS. THIS $4 MILLION IN OFFICE CONSTRUCTION BUILD OUT WAS NOT, AND I CHECKED, WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE DDA'S FISCAL YEAR '20 BUDGET OR FISCAL YEAR '21 PLAN. IN FACT, IT WAS NOT EVEN MENTIONED AS A POSSIBILITY WHEN COUNCIL REVIEWED THE DDA'S BUDGET LAST SPRING. AND THE $4 MILLION OFFICE BUILD-OUT PLAN WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE RESOLUTION PLACED ON COUNCIL'S AGENDA JULY 1ST TO ISSUE THE BONDS FOR THE PARKING EXPANSION. THE RESOLUTION THAT WAS WITHDRAWN AT THE LAST MINUTE WITH NO MENTION, NO MENTION AT ALL, OF THE OBVIOUS REASON IT WAS PULLED, THIS $4 MILLION BUILD-OUT PLAN. TONIGHT, THIS NEW $4 MILLION PLAN MAGICALLY APPEARS ON COUNCIL'S AGENDA, WITH NO HEADS-UP. APPARENTLY, THE DDA HAS BEEN DISCUSSING THIS FOR A WHILE NOW WITH THE INITIAL DRIVER OF THE DISCUSSION BEING THE NEED TO PROVIDE THE PARKING STRUCTURE OPERATOR, REPUBLIC, WITH MORE CUSTOMER SERVICE SPACE. OVER TIME, HOWEVER, THAT NEED FOR A BIT MORE SPACE FOR PUBLIC HAS EXPLODED INTO A $4 MILLION PLAN FOR NEW DDA OFFICES, PUBLIC OFFICES, MEETING SPACE, AND TONIGHT THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR INDICATES THAT THE PARKING STRUCTURE COULD INCLUDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WAS THAT DISCUSSED? I DON'T KNOW, BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT INTERESTS EVERYONE HERE, SO PERHAPS THAT'S WHY THAT WAS TOSSED INTO THE MIX. AND ALL OF THIS HAPPENS WITH NO DISCUSSION OF COUNCIL, JUST DROP IT INTO A RESOLUTION FOR COUNCIL TO APPROVE. AND, I'M SORRY, BUT THIS IS A TERRIBLE PROCESS, AND IT'S JUST NOT HOW THIS PARTNERSHIP IS SUPPOSED TO WORK. UNFORTUNATELY, THE PROPOSAL ITSELF IS NO BETTER THAN THE PROCESS. AS COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI SHARED HIS CONCERNS WITH THIS $4 MILLION PROPOSAL, IT'S A REALLY, REALLY EXPENSIVE PROPOSAL, AND IF YOU DO THE MATH, AS COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI DID, $4 MILLION FOR 885,000-SQUARE FOOT IS $465 PER SQUARE FOOT, AND THAT IS OFF THE CHARTS FOR TYPICAL OFFICE SPACE CONSTRUCTION. I ASKED SPECIFICALLY WHAT TYPICAL OFFICE SPACE CONSTRUCTION ARE PER SQUARE FOOT. THE DDA DID NOT RESPOND WITH ANY NUMBERS BUT DID SAY THIS WOULD BE COMPLICATED BECAUSE THE PROJECT WOULD CONSTRUCT A DECK UNDERNEATH EXISTING COLUMNS. I WOULD JUST SAY, OBVIOUSLY, COMPLICATED IS QUITE AN UNDERSTATEMENT. I'M NO EXPERT, CERTAINLY, BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THIS PROJECTED COST AT $465 A SQUARE FOOT IS TWO TO THREE TIMES THE TYPICAL CONSTRUCTION COSTS, SO, AT 465 DOLLARS A SQUARE FOOT OR $4 MILLION, THAT IS AN INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE SOLUTION ON BOTH AN ABSOLUTE AND PER SQUARE FOOT BASIS TO MEET THE SIMPLE NEED OF PROVIDING REPUBLIC WITH MORE CUSTOMER SERVICE SPACE. THAT'S WHAT THE MEMO INDICATED, THE NEED THAT'S BEING ADDRESSED HERE. SO, BUT, PERHAPS THE DDA CAN AFFORD IT. I DON'T KNOW, BUT I DO KNOW THAT WE HAVE A FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY TO ALL TAXPAYERS, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE LOCATED IN THE DDA DISTRICT, AND I DON'T BELIEVE THIS PROPOSAL MEETS THAT STANDARD. WE MAY HEAR TONIGHT A FINANCIAL ANALYSIS THE DDA PROVIDED. I FIND THAT MISLEADING. THE RENT, WHY, BECAUSE THE RENT SAVINGS NET OF LOSS PARKING REVENUE OF 1.3 MILLION ISN'T COMPARED WITH THE FULL $4 MILLION CONSTRUCTION COST, BUT JUST THE COST FOR THE -- FOR CONSTRUCTING THE DDA OFFICES. THINK ABOUT THAT. SO, TO BE CLEAR, THE REAL NET FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THIS PROPOSAL IS A SIGNIFICANT COST OF SEVERAL MILLION DOLLARS, NOT A BREAK EVEN, AND WE LOSE 18 PARKING SPACES WITH THE BUILD-OUT AS WELL. I WAS EXCITED WHEN I SAW THE RESOLUTION IN JULY THAT WE'D BE MOVING FORWARD WITH MUCH-NEEDED PARKING CAPACITY EXPANSION AT ANN ASHLEY. IF THAT'S WHAT WE WERE DOING TONIGHT, I WOULD BE FULLY SUPPORTIVE, BUT WE ARE NOT, AND TO BE HONEST, IT'S BOTH DISAPPOINTING AND FRUSTRATING, SO I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY OTHER COUNCILMEMBERS SHARE MY OBJECTION TO THIS $4 MILLION PROPOSAL. IF SO, I WOULD JUST SAY THAT WE HAVE A COUPLE OF ALTERNATIVES. WE COULD SIMPLY REJECT THIS RESOLUTION WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO THE D.D.A. TO RETURN AT THE NEXT MEETING WITH A BONDING PROPOSAL THAT EXCLUDES THE $4 MILLION OFFICE BUILD-OUT, OR WE COULD -- IT'S AN OFFICE BUILD-OUT. THAT'S HOW IT WAS PRESENTED TO US. OR WE COULD AMEND TONIGHT'S RESOLUTION TO REMOVE THE $4 MILLION BUILD-OUT. EITHER ACCOMPLISHES THE PURPOSE OF REFOCUSING THIS BACK TO THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF ADDING PARKING CAPACITY, SO, I'LL WAIT TO HEAR WHAT YOUR VIEWS ARE IN TERMS OF THE BUILD-OUT PROPOSAL, AND IF THERE ARE OBJECTIONS, YOUR VIEWS ON THE MOST APPROPRIATE ALTERNATIVE. IF THERE IS SUPPORT FOR AMENDING TONIGHT'S RESOLUTION, I HAVE THE LANGUAGE. I'LL SEND IT TO YOU, AND I WOULD BE HAPPY TO DO THAT LATER, SO THANK YOU FOR LISTENING.
04:46:37.569: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
04:46:38.803: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I'LL JUST SAY, WHEN I RAN FOR CITY COUNCIL, NOBODY WAS CLAMBERING FOR ME TO COME IN AND BOND US FOR MORE PARKING. WHEN I LOOK AT THIS RESOLUTION BEFORE US THAT PLEDGES A FULL FAITH AND CREDIT IN TAXING AUTHORITY IN THE CITY TO TAXPAYERS, I THINK WE DO 9 MILLION A YEAR IN DEBT SERVICE. IS THAT ACCURATE? HEY, HERE'S OUR GUY, MR. CRAWFORD. SO THAT'S $3 MILLION IN DEBT THAT THE CITY ALREADY OWNS, APPROXIMATELY, SO THIS IS 27 MILLION. BY THE TIME WE GET DONE PAYING IT, I DON'T KNOW WHAT BONDS ARE PAYING THESE DAYS, IT WILL BE LIKE ALMOST $2 MILLION. SO IT'S REALLY A $30 MILLION PROJECT WE ARE LOOKING AT. AND I KNOW THAT THERE'S CONCERNS ABOUT PARKING VANISHING. I KNOW THERE'S CONCERNS ABOUT THE BROWN BLOCK AND OTHER PARKING BEING DEVELOPED AND TAKING THAT SURFACE PARKING WITH IT, SO THERE'S SOME CONCERN, ADDING SPOTS AT $60,000 A SPOT, BUT, YOU KNOW, WE COULD ALSO BE LOOKING AT, YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY REQUIRING PRIVATE DEVELOPERS TO PAY FOR THEIR OWN PARKING. IT'S LIKE, I UNDERSTAND, I SAW IT WHEN I WAS DOWN THERE FOR THE MEETING ON THE WASTE PLANT. I SAW THERE IS A NEW LOGO UP ON THE WALL AT THE DDA, AND IT SAYS THAT YOUR MISSION NOW ISN'T TO SAVE A STRUGGLING DOWNTOWN, LIKE IT SAID BACK IN 1975, BUT IT'S TO ENCOURAGE PRIVATE INVESTMENT, AND SO WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT HERE IS THE PUBLIC TAKING THE RISK AND THE PRIVATE INVESTOR GETTING THE GAINS. SO WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 400 SPOTS. I MEAN, WE HAVE SO MANY NEEDS IN THIS CITY. TO ASK OUR TAXPAYERS TO GO ON THE HOOK FOR $30 MILLION, TO BOND $30 MILLION, HALF THE COST OF THE GELMAN CLEANUP, I MEAN, WE WERE -- NOT MANY, BUT MANY WERE CRYING OVER THE SUPPOSED 10 MILLION LOST ON THE CORE SPACES PROJECT, AND WE ARE TALKING ABOUT JUST FLIPPING AND GIVING A NOD TO $30 MILLION FOR PARKING, BUILDING HOUSING FOR CARS, NOT PEOPLE? AND WE COULD BOND $30 MILLION ON THE DDA TO PROVIDE WORKFORCE HOUSING IN THE DOWNTOWN, I WOULD DO THAT IN A SECOND BEFORE I WOULD BUILD HOUSING FOR CARS, AND SO THERE'S ALL KINDS OF REASONS I DON'T SUPPORT THIS IN ITS CURRENT LARGE FORM, AND I WOULDN'T SUPPORT IT IN A MODIFIED FORM EITHER. I THINK IT'S TOO MUCH. WE SHOULD BE RESERVING OUR DEBT LOAD FOR THINGS THAT ARE THE MOST CRITICAL FOR US. THAT'S OUR FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY. WE SHOULDN'T BE BONDING FOR SPECULATION AND BETTING ON THE FUTURE ON THE TAXPAYERS' BACKS. WE HAD THE SCHOOL BOARD COME TO US WITH A $1 BILLION ASK IN NOVEMBER. IT'S TOO MUCH. IT'S NOT HELPING OUR -- IT'S NOT HELPING RESIDENTS STAY HERE. IT'S NOT ENCOURAGING FOR THE LONG-TIME RESIDENTS, DESPITE THE FACT THAT, THANK GOODNESS, OUR PROPERTY TAX INCREASES HAVE BEEN CAPPED, OR IT WOULD BE INSANE. I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS. IT'S TOO MUCH AT THE WRONG TIME. WE JUST, WE HAVE TOO MANY NEEDS AS A CITY FOR ME TO HANG THIS ON THE TAXPAYERS' NECKS. I'M SORRY. YOU KNOW, I UNDERSTAND THIS KIND OF FORWARD THINKING IDEA THAT WE NEED MORE SPOTS, BUT I MEAN A LOT OF THOSE SPOTS ARE PERMANENTLY LEASED TO THE COUNTY, ARE THEY NOT?
04:50:18.423: >> THERE IS A LONG-TERM CONTRACT WITH THE COUNTY FOR SPACES, YEAH.
04:50:22.060: >> HOW MANY?
04:50:23.061: >> APPROXIMATELY 300. BUT JUST TO CLARIFY, THE PARKING EXPENSES ARE PAID FOR BY THE USERS OF THE SYSTEM, SO AS PEOPLE ARE IN THE PARKING GARAGES, AS THEY ARE IN THE PARKING SYSTEM, THAT'S WHERE THE REVENUES FOR THE SYSTEM ARE COMING FROM.
04:50:40.378: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  BUT THIS BOND IS BACKED BY THE FULL FAITH AND CREDIT OF THE PEOPLE OF THE ANN ARBOR, NOT THE FULL FAITH AND CREDIT OF PEOPLE WHO CHOOSE TO PARK IN PARKING STRUCTURES OR USE UBER TO GET DOWNTOWN OR TRAINS OR ANYTHING WHEN PARKING DISAPPEARS, AND THE NEED FOR MOTOR VEHICLES IN DOWNTOWN, WE ARE AT ODDS WITH EACH OTHER. AT ONE POINT, WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PROMOTE WALKING AND BIKING AND ON THE OTHER HAND WE ARE TALKING ABOUT BUILDING 400 MORE PARKING SPACES DOWNTOWN. THE TWO THINGS DON'T JIVE WITH ME. I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS. I'M SORRY. THANKS FOR LISTENING TO ME.
04:51:21.653: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  IT'S ALMOST MIDNIGHT. I'LL KEEP THIS SHORT. I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS OF COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI AND COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, AND I BUY INTO ALMOST EVERYTHING THAT COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER SAID. I DON'T BELIEVE AT MIDNIGHT WE SHOULD BE TRYING TO CRAFT NEW LANGUAGE. I WOULD RATHER SEE SOMETHING COME BACK CLEAN WITHOUT LUXURY OFFICE SPACE IN IT, SO I'M WILLING TO VOTE THIS DOWN AS IT'S BEEN PRESENTED TO US TONIGHT AND PERHAPS TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT ANOTHER DATE.
04:51:50.581: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN?
04:51:52.950: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN: THANKS, MR. MAYOR. I WAS ACTUALLY GOING TO SAY SOMETHING SIMILAR. IT SOUNDS LIKE THE BODY WOULD WANT THIS WITHOUT THE OFFICE SPACE AT THE VERY LEAST, SO I WAS GOING TO SUGGEST A POSTPONEMENT, WHICHEVER DIRECTION WE GO. IF WE WERE TO POSTPONE, HOW MUCH TIME WOULD YOU NEED? WOULD TWO WEEKS SUFFICE?
04:52:19.310: >> GOOD EVENING, TOM CRAWFORD, CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER. I THINK IT WOULD BE FINE TO VOTE IT DOWN AND LET US RECRAFT IT.
04:52:24.615: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN:  THAT SOUNDS GOOD.
04:52:26.551: >> BECAUSE WE'LL HAVE TO GO BACK AND GO THROUGH ALL OF THE NUMBERS.
04:52:29.420: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN: UNDERSTOOD.
04:52:30.988: >> WE CAN TRY TO MAKE IT FOR THE NEXT MEETING, AND IF NOT, THE ONE AFTER THAT.
04:52:37.595: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN:  IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE THIS BODY IS IN A HUGE RUSH.
04:52:41.699: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD?
04:52:42.633: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD:  AS A MEMBER OF THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION, I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW A NEW STAFF REPORT THAT SHOWS PEDESTRIANS, CYCLING, AND VEHICLE CRASHES OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS, AND IT'S EXTREMELY TROUBLING THE NUMBER OF CRASHES THAT ARE OCCURRING IN THE DOWNTOWN AREA, AND I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS EXACTLY WITHIN THE MISSION OF THE DDA, BUT WE HAVE GOT TO HAVE SOME SENSE OF OPERATIONS, NOT JUST PROJECTS DONE BY THE DDA. WE HAVE GOT TO MAKE OUR COMMUNITY MORE PEDESTRIAN FRIENDLY, AND THE ONLY WAY THAT WE CAN DO THAT IS TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF CARS DRIVING DOWNTOWN TO PARK, AND SO WE NEED TO BE CREATIVE AND THINK OF WAYS THAT WE CAN HAVE PARK AND RIDE LOTS AND MORE LOTS ON THE OUTSIDE RIM OF THE CITY AND HAVING PEOPLE USE MASS TRANSIT TO COME DOWNTOWN, SO I CANNOT NOT SUPPORT MORE PARKING DOWNTOWN, EVEN IF IT'S GOING TO BE A WASH IN THE FUTURE. WE SHOULD BE GOING TOWARDS LESS PARKING DOWNTOWN, AND WE HAVE GOT TO HAVE THE DDA TAKE SOME RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE PEDESTRIAN AND CYCLING CRASHES, AS WELL AS THE INFRASTRUCTURE DOWNTOWN, AND THE STREETLIGHT OUTAGES. I JUST FEEL LIKE IT SORT OF LOOKS LIKE A WAR ZONE DOWNTOWN, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE CONDITION OF SOME OF THE SIDEWALKS AND THE STREETS WHERE YOU'RE IN THE CROSSWALK, AND I DON'T KNOW HOW WE CAN SOLVE ALL OF THESE PROBLEMS, BUT WE HAVE GOT TO FOCUS ON OUR CRASH DATA AND GET IT REDUCED. THANK YOU.
04:54:16.294: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? I'M JUST GOING TO -- I WOULD LIKE TO JUST BRIEFLY CONNECT THE DOTS A LITTLE BIT WITH RESPECT TO PARKING AND HOUSING THAT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER. I DON'T THINK IT'S PROPOSED THAT THERE WOULD BE HOUSING AT THIS LOCATION, BUT IT IS OBSERVED THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF SURFACE LOTS THAT THE CITY OWNS IN THE DOWNTOWN. IF OUR GOAL IS TO MAINTAIN HOUSING STOCK -- PARDON ME. IF OUR GOAL IS TO AT LEAST MAINTAIN PARKING STOCK, IT'S -- IF WE WERE TO USE -- IF WE WERE TO USE OUR SURFACE PARKING LOTS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING, THAT WOULD REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF SPACES THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE FOR PARKING. THE CONSTRUCTION OF ADDITIONAL PARKING WOULD GIVE US THE FREEDOM TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS DOWNSTREAM WITHOUT RUNNING THE RISK OF REDUCING PARKING IN THE AGGREGATE. FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
04:55:10.381: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE TO GET THIS PROJECT COMPLETED, IF WE DID LOSE PARKING AT THE BROWN LOT, WE DID LOSE, YOU KNOW, SOME OTHER SURFACE LOTS. HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE FOR THIS PROJECT TO BE COMPLETED AND CARS TO BE PARKED IN THOSE ADDITIONAL FLOORS?
04:55:33.371: >> SO, THE ENGINEERS HAVE GIVEN US ROUGHLY A 20-22-MONTH SCHEDULE. THE REASON IT TAKES THAT LONG IS WE ARE GOING TO TRY TO KEEP THE GARAGE OPEN WHILE WE ARE CONSTRUCTING, SO WE CAN ONLY WORK IN LIMITED AREAS, SO IF THE COUNCIL WERE TO SUPPORT THIS, IF WE GO OUT TWO YEARS, WE COULD SEE SPACES.
04:55:55.760: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  OKAY. THANK YOU.
04:55:57.261: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER SMITH?
04:55:59.864: >> COUNCILMEMBER SMITH:  SO, IT OCCURS TO ME THAT ONE WAY WE COULD TACKLE OUR PARKING ISSUES IS BY -- I REALIZE THAT'S NOT POPULAR WITH MY COLLEAGUES, BUT IT IS A DISCUSSION, AND THERE IS A WIDE BODY OF LITERATURE TALKING ABOUT BENEFITS OF DOING THAT. I WOULD ALSO ULTIMATELY LIKE TO BE ABLE TO TIE THE CONVERSION OF THE OTHER SURFACE LOTS TO HOUSING AS A PART OF THIS PROPOSAL. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S TECHNICALLY FEASIBLE, BUT I THINK IF THIS IS GOING TO BE THE LINCHPIN IN FREEING UP SPACES THAT WE CAN UTILIZE FOR HIGHER, BETTER USES, THEN I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT IN THE DISCUSSION AND IN THE PROPOSAL.
04:56:46.777: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
04:56:49.013: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  WELL, THANK YOU. I THINK THAT'S INTERESTING. I THINK THAT COUNCILMEMBER SMITH AND MAYOR TAYLOR BOTH HAD DIFFERENT APPROACHES SHOWS THAT THIS SHOULDN'T JUST APPEAR ON AN AGENDA LIKE THIS. I FEEL THAT IT WAS A SHOCKER FOR SOME PEOPLE WHO WEREN'T -- YOU KNOW, IT'S A LOT ALL OF A SUDDEN FOR IT TO KIND OF COME OUT OF NOWHERE. AGAIN, THERE'S THIS TREND WHERE WE SAY, WELL, WE WANT TO DO AWAY WITH CARS FOR ALL OF THESE RIGHT REASONS, SO WE ARE NOT GOING TO ASK DEVELOPERS TO PUT PARKING ON THEIR OWN PROJECTS. WE ARE GOING TO SUBSIDIZE THOSE AND LET THEM LEASE SPACES IN OUR LOTS, RIGHT, AND SO THAT PUTS A BURDEN ON US TO BOND AND TO PROVIDE THIS, AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S -- WE NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT CREATIVE SOLUTIONS FOR THE FUTURE HERE, AND IF WE ARE TALKING ABOUT TURNING SURFACE PARKING THAT THE CITY OWNS, SAY, ON THE BACK SIDE OF 415 OR PLACES LIKE THAT INTO AFFORDABLE HOUSING, THERE IS NO REASON THAT WE CAN'T BUILD PARKING INTO THAT AT THE SAME TIME, OR ANY OTHER NUMBER OF APPROACHES. I MEAN, I GOT SOUNDLY PANNED ON SOCIAL MEDIA, I WAS TOLD, FOR SUGGESTING THAT WE BUILD HOUSING ON TOP OF OUR PARKING STRUCTURES, BUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S SOME PRIME REAL ESTATE WE ARE GIVING UP TO CARS RIGHT NOW IN THIS CITY, PRIME REAL ESTATE, SO I'LL HAVE TO LOOK INTO WHAT COUNCILMEMBER SMITH SAID. YOU SAY THAT THERE IS A MOVEMENT TO MAKE PARKING DOWNTOWN -- TO EXCLUDE PARKING FROM DOWNTOWNS? I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF THAT FULLY.
04:58:25.943: >> COUNCILMEMBER SMITH:  IT'S QUITE COMMON, REALLY. YOU DON'T REQUIRE PEOPLE TO BUILD PARKING IN DOWNTOWN.
04:58:33.050: >> YOU MEAN YOU DON'T REQUIRE DEVELOPERS TO?
04:58:35.653: >> ANYBODY. YOU MARKET AND ADDRESS PARKING.
04:58:41.192: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  BUT IN THIS CASE WE ARE THE MARKET.
04:58:42.793: >> COUNCILMEMBER SMITH:  I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE NOT DEBATE THAT.
04:58:46.430: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  NO, I DON'T WANT TO DEBATE IT. I WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT IT. I CAN'T IMAGINE WORKING WITH THE KINDS OF CROWDS THAT WE HAVE HERE IN TOWN, THE KIND OF TOURIST FLUX WITH THE UNIVERSITY AND SO ON, BUT YOU NEVER KNOW. I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT IDEAS BETTER, AND WE NEED TO HAVE A ROLL CALL VOTE TO RID OURSELVES OF THIS.
04:59:11.455: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE PLEASE STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER SMITH. SMITH?
04:59:15.226: >> COUNCILMEMBER SMITH:  NO.
04:59:15.826: >> CLERK BEAUDRY:  COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
04:59:17.261: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  NO.
04:59:17.895: >> CLERK BEAUDRY:  COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
04:59:18.762: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  NO.
04:59:19.363: >> CLERK BEAUDRY:  COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER?
04:59:21.432: >> COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER:  NO. GRISWOLD?
04:59:22.333: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD:  NO.
04:59:22.967: >> CLERK BEAUDRY:  COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
04:59:23.801: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  NO. GRAND?
04:59:25.035: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRAND:  YES.
04:59:25.836: >> CLERK BEAUDRY:  COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN?
04:59:26.737: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN:  NO.
04:59:27.404: >> CLERK BEAUDRY:  MAYOR TAYLOR?
04:59:28.038: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  YES.
04:59:28.539: >> CLERK BEAUDRY:  COUNCILMEMBER EATON?
04:59:29.740: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  NO.
04:59:30.341: >> CLERK BEAUDRY:  COUNCILMEMBER NELSON?
04:59:31.876: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  NO.
04:59:32.710: >> CLERK BEAUDRY:  THE MOTION FAILS.
04:59:33.911: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  DO WE HAVE COMMUNICATIONS TODAY FROM OUR CITY ATTORNEY?
04:59:38.082: >> CITY ATTY. POSTEMA:  NO MAYOR.
04:59:42.987: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  MAY I HAVE A MOTION PLEASE TO APPROVE THE CLERK'S REPORT? MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM. ALL IN FAVOR? [ CHORUS OF AYES ] OPPOSED? WE NOW COME TO PUBLIC COMMENT GENERAL TIME. PUBLIC COMMENT GENERAL TIME IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO SPEAK TO THE COUNCIL AND THE COMMUNITY ABOUT MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST. TO SPEAK, ONE NEED NOT HAVE SIGNED UP IN ADVANCE. SPEAKERS HAVE THREE MINUTES IN WHICH TO SPEAK. PLEASE PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE TIME CLOCK. AS A MATTER OF COURTESY, WE MAY ONLY HAVE ONE PERSON SPEAKING AT A TIME. FINALLY, IF YOU REQUIRE ASSISTANCE IN SPEAKING BEFORE COUNCIL TODAY, WE'D BE DELIGHTED TO PROVIDE IT TO YOU. IS THERE ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO COUNCIL? PLEASE.
05:00:25.529: >> THANK YOU, MAYOR AND COUNCIL. IT'S AN HONOR TO SPEAK TO COUNCIL, AND IN THIS COUNTRY, WE ARE LUCKY TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK TRUTH TO POWER WITHOUT FEAR OF REPERCUSSIONS. I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU FOR THE MANY, MANY HOURS THAT COUNCIL PUT IN. PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH TIME IS INVOLVED IN BEING A CITY COUNCILOR. I ALWAYS LIKE TO START WITH SOMETHING POSITIVE. I LIVE IN THE FOURTH WARD, AND SOUTH INDUSTRIAL, I THINK IN COMBINATION WITH THE CITY HAS BEEN PUTTING HANDICAPPED RAMPS AT ALL OF THE BUS STOPS, SO NOW IF YOU GET OFF ON A WHEELCHAIR, YOU HAVE A RAMP INSTEAD OF A CURB IF YOU WANT TO CROSS THE STREET, INSTEAD OF MOVING SEVERAL HUNDRED FEET DOWN TO A DRIVEWAY, SO THAT'S POSITIVE. I ALSO NOTE THAT THE CITY HAS PUT IN MILES OF ROAD, I SHOULD SAY SIDEWALK, IN THE -- ON EISENHOWER, AND THAT'S REALLY A NICE CONSTRUCTION, AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY GOING TO BE USED. THEY HAVE ALSO PUT, OF COURSE, MILES OF SIDEWALK ON ELLSWORTH IN AN AREA IN WHICH I'M NOT CLEAR WHY, BECAUSE THERE'S PRETTY MUCH SIDEWALK ON THE OTHER SIDE, AND IT'S ONLY SERVICING ON THAT SIDE THE CITY COMPOUND. BUT, ANYWAY, YOU KNOW, AND ALSO I LIKE THE FACT THAT THE CITY HAS BEEN TAKING SERIOUSLY -- I THINK PEOPLE APPRECIATE YOUR TREE PLANTING EFFORTS. I KNOW THE MAYOR HAS SPEARHEADED THAT. BUT THEN YOU COME ON A DAY LIKE TODAY WHEN THIS R1E HAS DESTROYED ONE OF THE MOST SENSITIVE SPOTS IN THE CITY, AND YOU HAVE TO LOOK BACK AND SAY WHAT'S GOING WRONG HERE, AND I THINK WHEN THE CITY'S MASTER PLAN REVISION COMES AROUND, SOME OF THESE UPZONINGS, I THINK WITH A CHANGE ON THE COUNCIL, THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE THAT SOME OF THOSE ARE GOING TO BE REVERSED SO THAT WE ARE NOT GAINING YEARS OF TREES AT THE LOSS OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS OF TREE LIFE AND IRREPLACEABLE TREES, AND THAT IS IMPORTANT FOR GLOBAL WARMING. WE NEED ABOUT A TRILLION MORE TREES IF WE ARE GOING TO COUNTERACT THAT. AND FINALLY, THE LAST THING THAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS THE SOLID WASTE PLAN. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY RECYCLE ANN ARBOR IS NOT BEING -- WHY THE SOLID WASTE PLAN IS RECOMMENDING BRINGING THIS TO IN-HOUSE WHEN YOU HAVE GOT RECYCLE ANN ARBOR, A LOCAL NONPROFIT UNION ORGANIZATION WHICH HAS PROVIDED SERVICES TO THIS COMMUNITY FOR ALMOST 50 YEARS UNERRINGLY, WITHOUT ANY SERIOUS SCANDALS, LIKE IN THE WASTE HAULING INDUSTRY, AND THEY HAVE NOW PROMISED THAT THEY CAN HAVE A PLAN, THAT THEY CAN OPEN THE MRF WITH PRIVATE MONEY, INCLUDE EXPANDED SERVICES, EDUCATION, AND WE ARE GOING TO BRING INSTEAD -- THE ALTERNATIVE IS TO BRING THIS IN HOUSE BACK TO THE PEOPLE WHO PUT THE MRF OUT OF BUSINESS? THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO ME.
05:03:21.705: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU.
05:03:30.881: >> HI. MY NAME IS EDWARD. I WANT TO TALK TONIGHT ABOUT SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOLS, AND IN PARTICULAR, SAFE ROUTES TO PIONEER HIGH SCHOOL, WHICH I HAVE A NEW INTEREST IN THAT THIS YEAR WITH A STUDENT THERE, AND IN VERY PARTICULAR, SAFE ROUTES TO PIONEER HIGH SCHOOL FROM THE EAST, SO THIS IS 4th WARD AND 3rd WARD AND POTENTIALLY -- IT'S PRETTY MUCH A 4th WARD AND 3rd WARD ISSUE. THE MAIN FEATURE OF THAT ROUTE IS THE STADIUM BRIDGES. THEY ARE ACTUALLY QUITE REASONABLE TO COMMUTE ACROSS BY BICYCLE. THE STAIRS THAT WERE PUT IN HAVE BICYCLE RAMPS GOING UP AND DOWN, SO IT'S POSSIBLE TO GO UP AND DOWN THE STAIRS WITH A BIKE AND JUST PUSH IT UP. THAT WORKS PRETTY WELL. THERE IS -- THERE ARE TWO RRFBs ALONG THE STADIUM BETWEEN SOUTH INDUSTRIAL AND SOUTH 7th THAT LET YOU CROSS MID BLOCK REASONABLY WELL. I WILL NOTE THAT THERE ARE NO RFBS BETWEEN SOUTH INDUSTRIAL AND PACKARD, WHICH MEANS THAT IT IS A VERY LONG BLOCK WITH NO MID BLOCK CROSSING, AND THEN IT PICKS UP RFBS AGAIN MID BLOCK BETWEEN PACKARD AND TECH MIDDLE SCHOOL, SO FROM A GAP PERSPECTIVE, THERE'S MAYBE ONE MISSING RFB. IT'S ACTUALLY NOT A BAD ROUTE ON A BICYCLE. THERE'S A COUPLE OF INTERSECTIONS THAT ARE BUSY WITH CROSS TURNING TRAFFIC INTO UNIVERSITY SPOTS. THE BIGGEST CONCERN, AND I KNOW THIS IS NOT THE SPACE OF CITY COUNCIL, BUT FROM A SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOL PERSPECTIVE, I THINK IT'S RELEVANT, IS THE MISERABLE BICYCLE INFRASTRUCTURE AT PIONEER HIGH SCHOOL. THE MAIN ENTRANCE, WHICH IS WHERE ALL STUDENTS GO IN, HAS MAYBE A DOZEN BIKE SPOTS, AND THERE IS ACRES AND ACRES AND ACRES OF PARKING, AND AGAIN, THIS IS NOT -- YOU ALL ARE NOT GOING TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM, RIGHT, AND BUT YOU SHOULD BE AWARE OF IT, AS PART OF THE SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOLS EFFORTS. THERE IS ALSO INFRASTRUCTURE ON THAT CAMPUS, THINGS THAT LOOK LIKE THEY SHOULD HAVE ADA RAMPS THAT DON'T, SO I'LL BE BRINGING THIS UP WITH THEM. YOU KNOW, IT'S BETTER THAN I HAD HOPED FOR. IT'S CERTAINLY BETTER THAN IT WAS FIVE YEARS AGO, WHEN THE STADIUM BRIDGE WAS -- OR TEN YEARS AGO, WHEN THE STADIUM BRIDGE WAS A COMPLETE MESS, BUT THERE'S STILL ROOM TO IMPROVE. OKAY. THANK YOU.
05:06:23.820: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT?
05:06:30.861: >> HI. I'M ADAM OXNER FROM WARD 4. I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK ON A FEW THINGS. FIRST, DURING THE SCHEDULED PUBLIC COMMENTARY, MARY GARTEN, I THINK, SPOKE ABOUT ABOUT RAGE AGAINST BIKERS, AND I HAVE EXPERIENCED THAT A LOT. I AM SURPRISED I DON'T HEAR MORE ABOUT IT. MAYBE THIS IS JUST COINCIDENTAL THAT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE HEARD ABOUT SOMEBODY EXPLAINING WHAT IT'S LIKE TO COUNCIL, BUT AS SOMEBODY WHO BIKES FOR COMMUTING AND FOR EXERCISE, I DO GET A LOT OF SCARY MOMENTS. I HAVE NEVER BEEN PHYSICALLY STOPPED BY A CAR, LUCKILY, BUT IT DOES GET SCARY WITH LARGE VEHICLES NEXT TO YOU WITH A LOSS OF POWER THERE. AND THEN ALSO, I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD, WHO WAS SPEAKING ABOUT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE MEETING, TALKING ABOUT NEEDING MORE PILOT PROGRAMS, BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT YOU HAVE BEEN VOTING AGAINST A LOT OF PILOT PROGRAMS, EVEN IF THEY ARE NOT PERFECT. I THINK THAT IT WOULD BE -- I MEAN, IT'S -- WHEN YOU'RE BUILDING SUCH COMPLICATED AND CONTROVERSIAL PROJECTS, THERE'S A LOT OF COMPROMISE THAT HAS TO GO ON, AND I THINK I SEE A GOOD EFFORT BY COUNCIL TO MEET IN THE MIDDLE IN A LOT OF PLACES, AND SOMETIMES THAT MEANS A BIKE LANE ON ONE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND NOT BOTH SIDES, BUT I WOULD RATHER HAVE ONE THAN NO ACTION TAKEN. AND THEN ALSO COUNCILMEMBER EATON SPOKE ON DENSITY HAVING AN IMPACT ON NATURAL FEATURES, AND I THINK THAT IS TRUE, AND I WOULD DEFINITELY PREFER A BROWNFIELD DEVELOPMENT TO A GREENFIELD DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT, BUT ALSO WHEN DENSITY IS HIGHER, IT'S EITHER THE DEVELOPMENT IS IN A SMALLER SQUARE FOOTAGE AREA CLOSER TO A DOWNTOWN AREA, WHICH IS LESS OF AN ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT AS A SPRAWLING SUBURB OUTSIDE OF THE GREEN BELT OR SOMETHING SIMILAR, SO I WOULD RATHER SEE A HIGHER DENSITY DEVELOPMENT DOWNTOWN WITH THE LOSS OF SOME TREES AND A COMPROMISE WHERE WE SAVE SOME TREES THAN NOT HAVE IT AT ALL. AND THEN -- OH, I GUESS THAT'S IT. SO, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
05:08:56.206: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT? SEEING NO ONE, PUBLIC COMMENT IS CLOSED. ARE THERE COMMUNICATIONS TODAY FROM COUNCIL? DO WE HAVE A CLOSED SESSION TODAY?

05:09:39.249: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  MAY I HAVE A MOTION PLEASE TO GO INTO CLOSED SESSION, MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER NELSON, SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER EATON, FOR THE PURPOSE OF LITIGATION.
