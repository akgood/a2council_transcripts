00:01:38.332: >> MAY I HAVE A MOTION TO PLEASE APPROVE THE AGENDA. HAYNOR DISCUSSION OF THE AGENDA ALL IN FAVOR?
00:01:47.007: >> YE.
00:01:47.641: >> THE AGENDA'S APPROVED.  WE OPT INTO PUBLIC COMMENT GENERAL TIME.  IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUB TUCKER LACK TO SPEAK TO THE MEMBERS.  ONE NEED NOT HAVE SIGNED UP IN ADVANCED, SPEAKERS HAVE THREE MINUTES IN WHICH TO SPEAK, SO PLEASE PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE TIME CLOCK AS MATTER OF COURTESY WE MAY HAVE ONLY ONE PERSON SPEAKING AT A TIME.  IF YOU REQUIRE ASSISTANCE IN SPEAKING BEFORE COUNCIL TODAY. THEREFORE ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT?
00:02:13.067: >> HEY, THERE.  UM, SO I COME TODAY WITH A POLICY REQUEST THAT YOU MAKE OUR CHANGE THE POLICY THAT YOU SHOULD MAKE.  THERE WAS WAY TOO EASY TO FIRE THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR.  STAFF JOBS SHOULD BE MORE STABLE THAN POLITICAL JOBS.  BASICALLY IT WAS SIX VOTES THAT VOTED HIM OUT.  IT SHOULDN'T BE THAT WAY. IT SHOULD ACTUALLY BE AN 8-VOTE REQUIREMENT TO DO THAT, AT LEAST I BELIEVE THAT.  PART OF THE REASON FOR THAT IS IN THEORY, WHAT CAN HAPPEN HERE IS THAT YOU GET A NEW CITY ADMINISTRATOR, WE HAVE AN ELECTION, THE MAJORITY GETS SWITCHED OVER TO ANOTHER PARTY.  AND THEN THEY DECIDE I DON'T THINK THIS WOULD HAPPEN, BUT THEN THEY DECIDE THAT HEY, POLITICALLY WE DON'T LIKE YOU. YOU'RE OUT TOO.  HOW ARE YOU GOING TO GET PEOPLE TO COME AND GET A JOB HERE WHEN YOU REALIZE THEY CAN BE VOTED OUT BY ONLY SIX VOTES IN THE NEXT ELECTION. THAT IS NOT A STABLE RUNNING CITY GOVERNMENT.  SO WHAT I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU DO IS MAKE IT TO EIGHT VOTES.  IF YOU WANT TO BE A BIT FRIENDLY ABOUT THAT, I SAY THAT YOU MAKE IT TO EIGHT VOICE IF IT'S BEFORE THE END OF THE CONTRACT, I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG IT IS THEN MAKET THE EIGHT VOTES.  WHAT HAPPEN ON THE OTHER DAY THERE THAT WAS CERTAINLY POLITICAL AND IT SHOULD THOUGHT HAVE HAPPENED, AND IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN EIGHT VOTES INSTEAD OF SIX.  I UNDERSTAND IT'S SIX BY COMMUNITY FELT WAS WARRANTED AND AS ELECTED OFFICIALS YOU NEED TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR YOUR ACTIONS. SO, THIS SPECIAL SESSION CAME UP KIND OF BY SURPRISE, AND I JUST HAVE KIND OF QUESTIONS THAT, YOU KNOW, IT'S GOING RIGHT TO PUBLIC COMMENT.  WHY WAS THIS SPECIAL SESSION CALLED?  YOU KNOW, LIKE, WITHOUT ANY COMMUNICATIONS FROM COUNCIL.  SO, IT'S JUST KIND OF, YOU KNOW, I WOULD WISH FOR MORE TRANSPARENCY FROM THAT.  YOU KNOW, I HAVE A SNEAKING SUSPICION IT'S BECAUSE OF MONDAY'S OR TUSSORE, IT'S TUESDAY'S FIRING OF MR. LAZARUS, AND YOU WANT TO GIVE MORE PEOPLE A CHANCE TO SPEAK OUT ON THAT. OBVIOUSLY ANOTHER MAJOR ISSUE RIGHT NOW IS THE ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE OF THE POLICE CHIEF WHICH IS ON TOP OF THE TURMOIL THAT THE SEVEN OF YOU HAVE CREATED INSIDE CITY HALL.  WE HAVE THAT AS A CITY TO DEAL WITH.  THERE'S A LOT OF CHAOS AND INSTABILITY AND I DON'T THINK THAT MAKES FOR GOOD CITY GOVERNMENT.  AZIONE ARBOR, THE PEOPLE OF ANN ARBOR, WE DEMAND AND EXPECT BETTER THAN THAT.  I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR FROM COUNCIL ON THE MATTER OF THE POLICE CHIEF, AND THE STATUS OF THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AND AND WT IS GOING ON.  ON TUESDAY THERE WERE A COUPLE OF MEMBERS OF THE COMMISSION, THE POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION, THAT'S NOT WHAT IT'S CALLED BUT, UM, THAT SPOKE.  AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.  SO, YOU KNOW, I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF YOU ALL KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.  I DON'T KNOW THE SPECIFICS OF THE POLICE DEPARTMENT HAS ITS OWN, YOU KNOW, AFTER AVENUES, AND IS KIND OF AN INTERNAL THING.  I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT, YOU KNOW, I HOPE NEXT MEETING WE HAVE MORE INFORMATION ON THAT, OR THAT YOU CAN KIND OF GET SOME OF THAT OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY. BUT, YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WERE EXPECTING THIS POLITICAL STORM FROM YOUR SNEAKY ACTIONS, BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO GO AWAY.  YOU KNOW, WE'RE GOING TO KEEP THIS UP AND YOU WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE.  THANK YOU.
00:06:50.310: >> THANK YOU.  IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT? SEEING NO ONE, PUBLIC COMMENT IS CLOSED. MAY I HAVE A MOTION WEEK, HAVE A CLOSE SESSION TODAY, MR. PRESIDENT.
00:07:01.722: >> WE DO.  WE'RE UNDER THE OPEN MEETINGS ACT.  THIS IS PRIVILEGED WRITTEN ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION UNDER 15.268H.
