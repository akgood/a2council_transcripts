00:00:12.408: >> GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE, AND WELCOME TO THE FEBRUARY 10 WORK SESSION OF THE ANN ARBOR CITY COUNCIL WITH RESPECT TO THE 21 FISCAL BUDGET OVERVIEW FINANCIAL AND ADMINISTRATION SERVICES: POLICE, FIRE, COMMUNITY SERVICES, AND CITY ADMINISTRATION. MR. LAZARUS, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
00:00:32.795: >> THANK YOU, AND GOOD EVENING, MAYOR TAYLOR, COUNCIL MEMBERS, STAFF WHO ARE HERE, AS WELL AS MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL OF YOU FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE IN THE BUDGET PROCESS SO FAR, AND FOR YOUR INPUT THAT WILL BE COMING OVER THE MONTHS BETWEEN NOW AND WHEN COUNCIL ADOPTS THE FINAL BUDGET. WE ALL HOPE TO DELIVER A BUDGET THAT MEETS THE NEEDS OF OUR COMMUNITY AND ENSURES A FINANCIALLY SOUND APPROACH. [ COMPUTER DINGS ] SO THIS EVENING'S PRESENTATION GIVING YOU AN OVERVIEW OF GENERAL FUND AND THE RELATED BUDGET CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE COMING YEAR. JENNIFER, THIS EVENING, HAS AN OVERVIEW I WILL PROVIDE. WE WILL GO INTO THINGS MR. CRAWFORD WILL ADDRESS. EACH SERVICE AREA RESOURCED TO THE GENERAL FUND, WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE COUNCIL PRIOR DISWE ESTABLISHED IN THE DECEMBER PLANNING SESSION, LOOK AT SOME MEASURES OF SUCCESS, AND KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS AND TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE IMPACTS AND NONFINANCIAL ADJUSTMENTS FOR FY ' 21. SOME OF THE KEY DATES THAT ARE UPCOMING ARE SHOWN ON THE SLIDE. YOU'LL NOTICE WE DO LOSE A DATE ON MARCH 9 BECAUSE OF THE PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY SO THAT CREATESES LESS OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS SOME OF THE TOPICS THAT ARE IN THE VARIOUS FUNDS THAT YOU'LL CONSIDER. AGAIN, WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE UNITS THAT GET THE MAJORITY OR SIGNIFICANT IMPORTANCE OF THEIR FUNDING FROM THE GENERAL FUND. THOSE ARE SHOWN ON THE CHART. THE TWO REMAINING GENERAL FUND AGENCIES -- THE CITY ATTORNEY AND OFFICE OF SUSTAINABILITY AND INNOVATIONS -- WILL PRESENT THEIR BUDGETS ON FEBRUARY 24 AND MARCH 30. SIGNIFICANTLY THE SUSTAINABILITY BUDGET WILL BE PROVIDED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE PRESENTATION OF THE CARBON NEUTRALITY PLAN. AS IT IS SHOWN ON THE SCHEDULE AS WELL, CITY ADMINISTRATOR'S BUDGET IS PRESENTED, RECOMMENDED BUDGET, IS PRESENTED TO COUNCIL ON APRIL 20 AND PER THE CITY CHARTER, COUNCIL CONSIDERS AND ADOPT THE BUDGET THE SECOND MEETING IN MAY. SOME NOTES ON THE GENERAL FUND -- AND THERE IS A LOT OF INFORMATION ON ONE CHART. THE GENERAL FUND PAYS FOR THE GENERAL OPERATIONS OF THE CITY GOVERNMENT. REVENUES TO THE GENERAL FUND PRIMARILY COME FROM PROPERTY TAXES, MORE THAN 50%. IT IS IMPORTANT AND SIGNIFICANT THE CITY'S OPERATING MIDDLAGE HAS DECREASED BY 4.5% OVER FIVE YEARS WHILE TOTAL REVENUES HAS INCREASED, INDICATIVE OF INCREASES IN PROPERTY VALUES AND AMOUNT OF NEW CONSTRUCTION. PUBLIC SAFETY ENTITIES CONSTITUTE THE MAJORITY OF GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURES AT OVER 40%, AND THE GENERAL FUND PROPOSAL FOR THIS YEAR CONTINUES THE ALLOCATIONS PRIORITIZED IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET, AND YOU CAN SEE THOSE LISTED UNDER THE FOURTH BULLET. AS WE TRANSITION INTO THE UNIT BY UNIT ANALYSIS, I WANT TO PAUSE AND REFLECT ON OUR MOVE TO OUR DECISION-MAKING PROCESS AS IS DEPICTED BY THE SLIDE. THE BOX ON THE LEFT IS THE PRIORITY MATRIX WHICH COUNCIL VIEWED AS EXERCISE 1 IN THE DECEMBER PLANNING SESSION. THE MATRIX DRAWS IN ALL OUR GOVERNING DOCUMENTS, COMMUNITY SURVEYS, COUNCIL PRIORITIES, AND STAFF RECOMMENDATIONS AND LEADS TO THE DEFINITIONS OF OUR PROJECTS, WHICH YOU SEE IN THE SECOND BOX. THE LEVEL OF SERVICES ARE GUIDED BY A DEFINITION OF WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS, WHICH, IN TURN, DETERMINES THE RESOURCE THOUGHT TO BE NEEDED TO ACHIEVE THAT OUTCOME. THE ITEMS THAT ARE SHOWN IN YELLOW ARE THE THINGS THAT WE'LL TOUCH ON THIS EVENING. TO THE FAR RIGHT YOU SEE A WHITE BOX THAT SAID "REPORTS/DASHBOARD" FOR RESULTS. THOSE ARE THINGS WE CONTINUE TO WORK ON AND WHILE COUNCIL HAS BEEN PROVIDED WITH AN ANNUAL REPORT FOR FY '19 AND FIRST QUARTER OF FY '20 UPDATE, OUR GOAL IS TO MAKE THIS VIEWABLE BY THE PUBLIC ONLINE IN A HIGHLY TRANSPARENT MANNER. THIS IS THE REVISED PRIORITY MATRIX. YOU HAVE SEEN IT BEFORE. I PUT IT IN HERE, REALLY, FOR REFERENCE, SO I WON'T DWELL ON IT. AS YOU REMEMBER, EXERCISE 2 -- EXERCISE 1 WAS UPDATING THE PRIORITY MATRIX. EXERCISE 2 WAS RESPONDING TO SOME CHALLENGES, AND WE USED TO COLOR CODE OF GREEN, YELLOW, AND RED TO SHOW THE PRIORITY. THOSE ON THE TOP ARE IN GREEN, THE ONES THAT COUNCIL INDICATED WERE BOTH HIGH URGENCY AND HIGH IMPORTANCE. THE ONES IN THE YELLOW GENERALLY WERE OF HIGH IMPORTANCE BUT NOT AS URGENT, AND THE ONES IN RED WERE VIEWED TO BE LOWER IN URGENCY AND IMPORTANCE. THAT IS NOT TO SAY THEY ARE NOT IMPORTANT. IT WAS JUST IN A RELATIVE RANKING, THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT WERE VIEWED AS LESS PRESSING. THE COLUMN ON THE RIGHT ON THIS TABLE SHOWS WHERE YOU WILL FIND THESE IN THE BUDGET SO THAT IS THE SERVICE UNIT WHERE YOU WILL BE ABLE TO FIND WHERE THOSE CHALLENGES AND PRIORITIES ARE LISTED. SO I AM GOING TO TURN THE MICROPHONE OVER TO MR. CRAWFORD TO TAKE YOU THROUGH THE NEXT COUPLE OF CHARTS.
00:06:22.978: >> GOOD EVENING. SO FOR A BUDGET DISCUSSION, I WANT TO JUST TAKE A MINUTE TO GROUND YOU IN WHAT THE FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS LOOK LIKE SO YOU KNOW WHAT RESOURCES YOU HAVE AVAILABLE AS WE GO INTO THESE DISCUSSIONS. THE CHART IN FRONT OF YOU HAS A LARGE BOX. ON THE FIRST COLUMN, IT REPRESENTS THE FISCAL ' 21 INITIAL PLAN WHEN WE APPROVE THE TWO-YEAR BUDGET LAST YEAR. THAT COLUMN IS THE PLAN OF WHAT WE PROJECTED '21 TO BE. THE NEXT COLUMN OVER ECONOMICS REFLECTS OUR ESTIMATES FOR THIS YEAR FOR ALL THE THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED FROM AN ECONOMIC STANDPOINT. THIS IS NOT CHANGES DRIVEN BY STAFF BUT PURE ECONOMICS. WHAT YOU'LL SEE IS ON THE RECURRING SURPLUS/DEFICIT, THE PLAN WAS ADOPTED WITH A $200,000 SURPLUS AS WE ROLL THROUGH ECONOMIC. THERE'S NEW A $500,000 SURPLUS YOU CAN USE ON A RECURRING BASIS TO ADDRESS ISSUES AND INITIATIVES THAT YOU'D LIKE. HOWEVER, IN FISCAL' 22, I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT IS PROJECTED TO BE -1.6 SO AS YOU MAKE DECISIONS, IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THE CONTEXT IN WHICH THE LONGER-TERM PROJECTIONS LOOK. AND THIS PROJECTION IN '22 IS WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN THE PAST WITHIN THE NORMAL RANGE OF WHAT WE SEE AS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN OUR REVENUES DON'T INCREASE AS FAST AS INFLATION DOES FOR OUR EXPENDITURES. ON THE ONE-TIME ITEMS, I WANT TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE FACT THIS INCLUDE THE MILLION-DOLLAR DISTRIBUTION THE STATE HAS GIVEN US FOR FIRE PROTECTION BY INCLUDING THAT WITHOUT EXPENDITURES AGAINST THAT, OUR UNDESIGNATED FUND BALANCE WOULD BE 17.6% AT THE END OF '21. FOR YOUR FRAME OF REFERENCE, AS YOU START TO MULL DECISIONS, FOR EVERY MILLION DOLLARS IN EXPENDITURES THAT YOU MAKE, THAT'S ROUGHLY A $900,000 -- I'M SORRY, A 0.9% REDUCTION IN THE FUND BALANCE NUMBER, OKAY? $1MILLION IS AROUND 0.9%. LET'S SEE. GOING TO THE NEXT SLIDE, THEN, I WANT TO TAKE JUST A MINUTE TO GIVE AN OVERVIEW BEFORE WE JUMP INTO THE DEPARTMENTAL LEVEL SESSIONS. ON THIS SLIDE, THE SECOND COLUMN IN CALLED "RECURRING" PULLS FROM THE PRIOR SLIDE, BUT WHAT IT DOES ON THE SECOND ROW IS YOU WILL SEE SOME OF THE IMPACTS STAFF WILL BRING YOU TODAY ACTUALLY COME WITH THEIR OWN REVENUE. THERE'S REALLY ZERO IMPACT TO THE CITY NET SO WHAT THIS COLUMN DOES, YOU WILL SEE $272,000 OF ADDITIONAL REVENUES INCLUDED. THAT MEANS IN THE FIRST SECTION THERE, THE BOLDENED LINE THAT SAID "FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR STAFF REQUESTS," YOU SEE 772. THAT'S THE 272 ON TOP OF THE 500,000 I TALKED ON THE LAST PAGE. BELOW THAT IN THE BOTTOM SECTION IS A SUMMARY OF STAFF REQUESTS BROKEN IN SOME CATEGORIES. SO BASICALLY YOU'VE GOT $772,000 OF MONIES AVAILABLE TO SPEND. STAFF REQUESTS TOTAL AT THE BOTTOM $2.3 MILLION. THOSE ARE SOME OF THE PRIORIZATION AND TRADE-OFFS YOU WILL MAKE. SOME OF THE REQUESTS WERE INCLUDED -- WELL, SEE, WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY ON THE RECURRING INCLUDED ON THE PACE PLAN. YOU WILL SEE THE 272 IN EXPENDITURES OFFSET BY REVENUES SO IF YOU DON'T SPEND THE -- OR IF YOU SPEND THE 272, YOU GET THE REVENUE WITH ZERO IMPACT. THERE ARE OTHER CATEGORIES. WE HAVE SOME IMPACTS THAT RELATE TO THE REQUIRED SERVICES THAT WE HAVE, MEETING THE POLICY DIRECTIONS THAT YOU HAVE ESTABLISHED. WE'VE GOT LOOKING AT YOUR HIGH PRIORITY COMMITMENTS. WE'VE GOT SOME IMPACTS AS WELL AS SOME IMPACTS WE'VE CATEGORIZED AS "IF WE END UP WITH EXTRA MONEY AT THE END OF THE YEAR, FOR WHATEVER REASON, YOU MAY CONSIDER FUNDING THOSE OUT OF FUND BALANCE." AND THERE ARE SOME ITEMS LIKELY NOT FUNNELED. AND ONE-TIME COLUMN, WE'VE GOT ABOUT $1.3 MILLION OR $1.247 MILLION AVAILABLE FOR ONE-TIME USE. AND THEN GOING DOWN THAT COLUMN, SIMILAR CATEGORY OR SAME CATEGORIES, AS YOU CAN SEE. THOSE REQUESTS FROM STAFF ARE $3.5 MILLION. SO AS YOU CAN SEE, THERE ARE LOT MORE REQUESTS -- ABOUT THREE TIMES THE REQUEST -- AS RESOURCES AVAILABLE. THAT'S THE BIG PICTURE GOING INTO THIS DISCUSSION. I WANT TO START OFF -- ANY QUESTIONS ON THAT BEFORE I JUMP TO DEPARTMENTAL? YES.
00:11:08.130: >> COULD YOU EXPLAIN UNFUNDED? I MUST HAVE MISSED IT.
00:11:13.168: >> YOU'VE GOT A WORKBOOK OR A WORKBOOK WE HAVE PROVIDEDDED YOU WHERE WE HAVE TAKEN A STAB AT PUTTING THEM IN BUCKETS, AND THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT ARE REALLY KIND OF THE -- AT THIS POINT, PRIORITIZED THE LEAST. AND THAT WORKBOOK IS REALLY FOR YOU GUYS TO CONSIDER, GIVE US FEEDBACK ON WHETHER YOU AGREE. IT'S FOR DISCUSSION PURPOSES.
00:11:34.923: >> JUST -- YEAH, THE QUESTION ABOUT THE 1.3 IN ONE-TIME REVENUES FOR FISCAL YEAR '21. CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT THAT IS? IS IT STATE REVENUE SHARING? AND IF SO, CAN YOU REMIND US HOW THAT IS HAND ASKED WHAT THE GOVERNOR PUT IN HER BUDGET?
00:11:56.378: >> ONE MILLION DOLLARS REPRESENTS THE FIRE PROTECTION MONEY AND THE 247 -- YOU MAY RECALL AS THE CONSTITUTION CONSTITUTIONAL INCREASING --
00:12:08.223: >> ON TOP OF THE ONE MILLION.
00:12:10.992: >> YES. THE 247 IS REALLY THE PORTION OF REVENUE SHARING THAT IS NOW CONSIDERED NONRECURRING OR ONE-TIME. THAT IS DERIVED FROM OUR POLICY THAT WE USE --
00:12:21.002: >> IS THAT THE STATUTORY PIECE OR THE --
00:12:24.172: >> YES.
00:12:24.406: >> CONSTITUTIONAL WHATEVER --
00:12:25.674: >> IT'S STATUTORY.
00:12:26.942: >> OKAY.
00:12:27.976: >> UM-HMM.
00:12:29.444: >> THANK YOU.
00:12:30.946: >> MM-HMM. OKAY, I'LL JUMP INTO THE DEPARTMENTAL IMPACTS BY TALKING NON-DEPARTMENTAL BECAUSE THAT'S KIND OF THE ODD BALL. IT'S THE PLACE WE PUT EXPENDITURES -- IT'S PRIMARILY DEBT SERVICE AND PASS-THROUGH ENTITIES BUT WE HAVE A FEW ITEMS WE PUT IN THERE THAT COULD RELATE -- THAT ARE NOT SPECIFICALLY DEFINED FOR A KNOWN ACTION UP FRONT. LET ME JUST GO THROUGH THOSE. SO THE OVERHIRE PROGRAM -- OH, THANK YOU. [ CHUCKLING ] THE OVERHIRE PROGRAM WE'VE HAD FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. WE HAD PLANNED TO NOT HAVE THAT RECURRING IN '21. THIS IS AN IMPACT REQUESTING WE DO IT FOR ANOTHER YEAR. IT'S ANOTHER -- IT'S A ONE-TIME REQUEST. SOME OF OUR SUCCESSION PLANS ARE STILL IN PROCESS SO THERE'S A REQUEST TO EXTEND THAT FOR ANOTHER YEAR FOR $100,000. THE -- WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE SECOND LINE FOR THE FIRE STATION MASTER PLANNING, THIS IS SETTING ASIDE A HALF MILLION DOLLARS OF THAT MILLION DOLLARS FOR FIRE USAGE, AND THE RECOMMENDATION HERE REALLY IS TO START PLANNING FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF OR ACTIVITIES RELATED TO THE FIRE STATION MASTER PLAN. WHAT WE WOULD DO WITH THIS CASE IS IF THIS REFUNDED, WE WOULD REFER THIS TO THE CAPITAL PROJECTS FUND AND START BUILDING UP THAT FUND BALANCE SO WE CAN PAY FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF WHAT IS DECIDED. THE THIRD LINE, U OF M DINNER. EVERY COUPLE OF YEARS, THE SENIOR -- THE GOVERNING BODIES OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AND THE CITY, ALONG WITH SENIOR IS ASKING GATHER TOGETHER TO TALK ABOUT ISSUES AND THINGS AND THE CITY HAS NOT DONE THAT IN SEVERAL YEARS. THIS IS ON AS AN IMPACT TO DO THAT IN FISCAL '21. WE HOST SOME YEARS AND THEY HOST OTHER YEARS. THE NEXT LINE DOWN IS AN IMPACT SUGGESTING A SUPPLEMENTAL $500,000 CONTRIBUTION TO THE PENSION SYSTEM. AS YOU RECALL, YOUR FUNDING POLICY FOR THE SYSTEM GOES UP 2% FOR YEAR. IN ORDER TO HELP ADDRESS AND MITIGATE IMPACT AND MAKE MORE PROGRESS ON THE FUNDING LEVEL OF THE PLAN -- WHICH YOU WILL HEAR MORE IN A LATER PRESENTATION -- THERE'S A SUGGESTION TO START MAKING AN INCREMENTAL IMPACT SO WE CAN RESET THAT PAYS HIGHER. YOU MAY RECALL ME SAYING THAT THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS THAT RESETTING CONTRIBUTION LEVEL HIGHER BEFORE WE LET THAT 2% CONTINUE WOULD BE BENEFICIAL, IN MY VIEW. THE NEXT LINE IS THE CAPITAL SINKING FUND. YOU MAY RECALL ALL THE GENERAL FUND ASSETS THAT WE HAVE TO REPLACE -- BUILDINGS AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND RENOVATIONS AND ONGOING CAPITAL ISSUES -- WE NEED ABOUT $400,000 PER YEAR DURING THE BUDGET ADOPTION LAST YEAR -- $92,000 WAS USED FOR ANOTHER PURPOSE. WE WOULD LIKE TO RESTORE THAT SO THAT'S A RECURRING ITEM AND YOU CAN SEE THAT ON THE RIGHT WITH THE "R." AND LASTLY, WHAT WE -- OR HAVEN'T REALLY FINALIZED NAME -- BUT CONSIDERING AND IMPLEMENTING AN INTERNAL CARBON TAX. THIS IS AN IDEA YOU WILL HEAR MORE ABOUT WHEN YOU HEAR FROM THE SUSTAINABILITY PEOPLE, AND THE DEMOCRAT IN -- I THINK IT'S APRIL. I DID WANT TO -- AS WE GO THROUGH THE PRESENTATION NOW AND IN THE PUBLIC WORKS, THE IDEA IS HERE IS TO INVESTIGATE AND POTENTIALLY IMPLEMENT AN SPECIAL TAX ABOUT WHERE WE GENERATE CARBON. THE PURPOSE OF THAT WOULD BE TO FUND CLIMATE ACTION INITIATIVES, WHICH REDUCE OUR CAR UPON FOOTPRINT. THIS WOULD BE A WAY TO FUND AT A RELATIVELY SMALL DOLLAR AMOUNT. THIS WOULD BE A $30,000 IMPACT ON THE GENERAL FUND. YOU WILL SEE THE THE IMPACTS ON THE OTHER FUNDS AS THEY COME THROUGH IN FUTURE PRESENTATIONS AND A MORE BROAD PER DESCRIPTION OF WHAT WE'RE THINKING THERE. MR. LAZARUS?
00:16:39.427: >> MR. MAYOR.
00:16:40.328: >> BEFORE WE PROCEED, I WOULD JUST LIKE -- I ORIGINALLY INTENDED TO SEEK A CLOSED SESSION AT THE END OF THIS MEETING TO DISCUSS THE POLICE CHIEF MATTER, AND BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN ADVISED THAT THERE WOULD BE SIGNIFICANT RESTRICTIONS ON WHAT WE COULD DISCUSS IN THAT, I WON'T BE CALLING FOR THAT CLOSED SESSION, AND WE HAVE SOME NEWS OUTLETS HERE I THINK WHO ARE WAITING TO SEE IF WE TAKE ANY ACTION ON THAT SO I JUST WANTED TO SAY I'M NOT GOING TO CALL FOR A CLOSED SESSION. AND IF THAT --
00:17:14.662: >> SO YOU DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME.
00:17:17.699: >> -- THAT RELEASES THE MEDIA MAYBE FROM SITTING THROUGH THE ENTIRE PRESENTATION IF THAT HELPS THEM. THANKS.
00:17:23.771: >> THANK YOU FOR THAT. SO WE'LL BEGIN THE UNIT-BY-UNIT ADMINISTRATOR'S OFFICE. THE UNITS WITHIN THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR'S OFFICE ARE SHOWN ON THE ORGANIZATION CHART. REMEMBER THAT THE OFFICE OF SUSTAINABILITY AND INNOVATIONS WILL PRESENT ITS BUDGET ON MARCH 30, ALONG WITH THE CARBON NEUTRALITY PLAN. FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO GO BACK AND LOOK HISTORICALLY AT THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR'S OFFICE, ALSO NOTE FLEET AND FACILITIES HAS BEEN MOVED IN UNDER THE ASSISTANCE OF THE ADMINISTRATOR, AND THAT ACCOUNTS FOR A LARGE AMOUNT OF BUDGET INCREASE YOU MAY LOOK AT FROM PAST BUDGET DOCUMENTS. THESE ARE THE PRIORITIES THAT COUNCIL IDENTIFIED FOR THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR'S OFFICE, AND THEY ARE, AGAIN, GREEN AND AN AMBER TO SHOW THE RELATIVE RANKING BASED ON THE FEEDBACK WE GOT FROM COUNCIL IN DECEMBER. EACH OF THE PRESENTERS THIS EVENING WILL START WITH A CHART SIMILAR TO THIS ONE, AND IT IDENTIFIES THE PROGRAMS WITH THE ORGANIZATIONAL ELEMENTS. ONE OF THE THINGS YOU WILL SEE AS WE GO THROUGH THE PROCESS OF PERFORMANCE-BASED BUDGETING AND DECISION MAKING IS DEFINE WHAT THOSE PROGRAMS ARE. THE SECOND BOX IN SHOWS THE AMOUNT OF BUDGET ALLOCATED TO EACH ONE. HERE THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF FUNDING WITHIN THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR'S OFFICE IS IN HR. THAT'S NOT FOR LABOR. THAT IS FOR ALL THE COSTS THAT COME ALONG WITH HR. THE BOXES TO THE RIGHT OF THAT SHOW THE PRIORITIES, AGAIN, HIGH PRIORITIES. SO UNDER THE CLERK'S OFFICE, YOU SEE "INCREASE VOTER PARTICIPATION." UNDER HUMAN RESOURCES, THE TWO ITEMS ARE "TO INCREASE WORKFORCE DIVERSITY" AND "IMPLEMENT NON-UNION CAREER PROGRESSIONS." AND UNDER SUSTAINABILITY AND INNOVATIONS "IMPROVE ENERGY EFFICIENCIES OF OUR BUILDINGS" AND "ADDRESS CARBON NEUTRALITY." SOME OF THE MEASURES OF SUCCESS THAT COME WITH THESE -- INCREASING VOTER PARTICIPATION. WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO TRACK THE INCREASE IN VOTER TURNOUT AND ABSENTEE BALLOTS OVER PREVIOUS YEARS. FOR WORKFORCE DIVERSITY, WE SHOULD REPORT BACK ON THE OUTREACH METHODS THAT WE USE TO EXPAND THE RECRUITING BASE AND THEN TRACK AND REPORT ON THE DEMOGRAPHIC PROFILE OF OUR APPLICANTS AND NEW HIRES. FOR THE NON-UNION CAREER PROGRESSION, WE SHOULD DEVELOP AND FINALIZE THE SUCCESS STRATEGIES PROGRAM DOCUMENTS THIS COMING YEAR. AND THEN THE LAST TWO, IMPROVING ENERGY EFFICIENCY OF BUILDINGS AND ADDRESSING CARBON NEUTRALITY ARE ITEMS THAT WILL BE PRESENTED ON MARCH 30. SO SOME OF THE IMPACTS TO ACHIEVE THESE PRIORITIES ARE SHOWN. AGAIN, ON THE RIGHT, THE TYPE O IS A ONE-TIME AND R IS RECURRING. AS WE GO DOWN THE LIST, YOU CAN SEE STARTING WITH INCREASING VOTER PARTICIPATION, THERE IS A COST TO CREATE A SATELLITE OFFICE TO IMPROVE REGISTRATION, AND THERE ARE COSTS FOR NEW EQUIPMENT THAT THE CLERK WILL HAVE TO PURCHASE IN ORDER TO HELP SPEED UP THE COUNTING OF BALLOT. THEN THERE'S ALSO TEMPORARY STAFFING FOR THE SATELLITE OFFICE. UNDER INCREASING WORKFORCE DIVERSITY, THE TWO ITEMS ARE START-UP FUND FOR OUR DIVERSITY EQUITY INCLUSION WORK AND CONTINUING TO FUND THE JOB CORPORATION PROGRAM THAT WE STARTED THIS PAST YEAR. OUR GOAL THERE IS TO TRANSITION THAT TO THIRD-PARTY FUNDING AS WELL AS WE LOOK FOR GRANTS AND PRIVATE SECTOR MONEY. IMPLEMENTING THE NON-UNION CAREER PROGRESSION. THERE IS A SMALL COST TO COVER OUR TRAINING AND THEN THERE IS THE THOUGHT OF ADDING A DEVELOPMENT SUPERVISOR THAT WOULD BE A RECURRING COST. REMEMBER, THESE COSTS ARE ALL CONSTRAINED AND WITH YOUR HELP, WE'LL BE ABLE TO PRIORITIZE THEM. IMPROVING THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY OF THE BUILDINGS IS ABOUT $100,000 COST AND THEN FINALLY, WITH THE CARBON NEUTRALITY, WE'LL ADDRESS THAT WITH THE OSI BUDGET. SOME OTHER IMPACTS THAT ARE IN THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR'S OFFICE THAT WEREN'T TIED TO COUNCIL PRIORITIES -- THERE IS -- THERE ARE SOME SMALL COSTS RELATED TO HR. THERE'S ONE STAFF MEMBER PROPOSING TO PUT FROM THREE DAYS A WEEK TO FOUR DAYS A WEEK. UNDER FLEET FACILITIES AND AVIATION, THERE IS A DUCT CLEANING WHICH WOULD BE TIED TO THE PREVIOUS PROJECT TO IMPROVE THE HVAC. A COUPLE OF OTHER THING THAT HAVE COME UP -- DOING A STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS AND BUILDINGAGE SIS FOR 926 MARY STREET -- BUILDING ANALYSIS AT 926 MARY STREET, THE OLDEST POLLING PLACE IN THE CITY, AS WELL AS OTHER USES. THE A2 MUNICIPAL COMPLEX, THE PAVERS IN THE BACK NEED TO BE REPLACED. WE TALKED ABOUT THE HVAC MODERNIZATION. ADDITIONAL FLEET MANAGEMENT STAFF. WE HAVE RECEIVED ONE REQUEST TO ADD AN FTE. AND FINALLY, SOME TEMPORARY STAFF AS WELL FOR FLEET FACILITIES AND AVIATION. SOME OTHER HORIZON ISSUES ARE THICKS YOU MOST LIKELY WILL NOT SEE IN THE BUDGET BUT LAY OUT THERE BEYOND THE PLANNING PERIOD. FY23 IS THE END OF THE WARRANTY PERIOD FOR THE VOTINGER EQUIPMENT AND BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE EQUIPMENT THE COUNTY PURCHASED, THE COST TO EXTEND THE WARRANTY FOR YEARS SIX THROUGH TEN IS $65,000 A YEAR. THAT'S CURRENTLY NOT PART OF OUR BUDGETING THOUGHT. COMMUNICATIONS -- WE'LL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE FRANCHISE FREE STRUCTURE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL IN AS IT MAY AFFECT REVENUE. AND HR -- THERE'S A CONTINUED TURNOVER OF STAFF AS SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF STAFF ENTER THE RETIREMENT WINDOW. SO THOSE ARE THINGS WE'LL CONTINUE TO WATCH AND IN THE COMING YEARS AS WELL. I WOULD LIKE TO PAUSE TO SEE IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. IF NOT, I WILL TURN THIS OVER -- OH, I'M SORRY.
00:23:31.038: >> THANKS. WHEN I SAW THAT -- SO THE CITY CLERK'S OFFICE 2.8% OF THE BUDGET AND COMMUNICATIONS 4.8% OF YOUR TOTAL BUDGET. SO IS THAT -- I'M DO CURIOUS. DOES THAT INCLUDE OPERATIONS OF CTN, THE NETWORK?
00:23:48.723: >> THAT'S JUST THE GENERAL FUND IMPACT SO THAT'S -- I THINK IT DOES INCLUDE THE CTN BUDGET.
00:23:54.829: >> I JUST WONDERED IF THE CLERKS -- IT SEEMS THE CLERK DOES SO MUCH. IS IT BECAUSE SOME OF THEIR SERVICES ARE FEE FOR SERVICE? IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE IT'S LESS THAN COMMUNICATIONS.
00:24:06.974: >> THE CITY CLERK IS PER SALARY AND THEN THE FUNDING -- WHICH IS FUNDING FOR SUPPORT OF THE ELECTIONS AND NORMAL CLERKS. OPERATIONS. WE'LL CHECK ON COMMUNICATIONS. I BELIEVE THAT'S ONLY -- I THINK THAT DOES INCLUDE CTN, BUT WE'LL CHECK.
00:24:25.560: >> I JUST WONDERED WHAT WAS IN THAT NUMBER. THANK YOU.
00:24:28.896: >> THANK YOU. PAGE 15 AND PAGE 16. PERTAINS TO VOTING. WE LOOK AT A SIGNIFICANT COST FOR HIGH-SPEED TABULATOR FOR ABSENTEE BALLOT. SEEMS LIKE A SIGNIFICANT COST, AND I APPRECIATE THE INFORMATION NOW. AND THEN WE TALK ABOUT NEW EQUIPMENT AFTER FISCAL YEAR '23 -- I THINK IT'S IN THE NEXT SLIDE. WOULD THAT NEW EQUIPMENT SATISFY SOME OF THE TABULATION SPEEDS THAT WE WANT TO ADDRESS?
00:25:09.136: >> THE TABULATOR --
00:25:11.205: >> SEPARATE.
00:25:12.440: >> -- YOU CAN JUMP IN -- WE EXPECT A BIG INCREASE IN ABSENTEE BALLOTS WITH NO REASON ABSENTEE VOTING, IF THAT'S CORRECT.
00:25:21.849: >> THE 65,000 IS NOT FOR NEW EQUIPMENT. IT'S BECAUSE THE EQUIPMENT WE HAVE IS REACHING ITS WARRANTY EXPIRATION AND IS TO CONTINUE.
00:25:32.293: >> OKAY.
00:25:33.494: >> THE $65,000 IN THE HORIZON ISSUE --
00:25:37.198: >> THE CONTRACT SERVICES.
00:25:38.432: >> RIGHT.
00:25:38.966: >> TO MAINTAIN THE EQUIPMENT WE HAVE.
00:25:41.135: >> RIGHT.
00:25:41.402: >> SO WITH THE $50,000 FOR THIS TABULATOR, HOW MANY ABSENTEE BALL LOTS ARE WE -- OBVIOUSLY IF WE'RE ALL ELECTIONS -- IT'S A SIGNIFICANT COST JUST TO GET AN ANSWER AN HOUR OR SIX HOURS SOONER. IT SEEMS AN EXPENSIVE PREMIUM.
00:26:00.354: >> WE'RE STILL LOOKING PAT WHAT OUR OTHER OPTIONS ARE BECAUSE WE'RE ACTUALLY FINDING THAT THE HIGH SPEED UNIT IS PROBABLY GONNA COME IN SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER THAN WHAT WE WERE ASKING. WE HAVE REGULAR TABULATORS. WE'RE REVIEWING ALL THE OPTIONS AND IT MIGHT BE THAT WE COULD ADD ADDITIONAL REGULAR TABULATORS AT A REDUCED COST. BUT WE'RE -- LAST PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION WE WERE AT 15,000 ABSENTEE BALLOTS AND EXPECT THAT WE COULD POSSIBLY REACH 25,000 OR 30,000 THIS YEAR.
00:26:32.586: >> THE EQUIPMENT THAT WE HAVE, THE NEW EQUIPMENT WE PURCHASED THROUGH A GRANT -- SO WE DIDN'T PAY FOR THE INITIAL PROCUREMENT OF THAT. BUT UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE IT WAS EXPENSIVE EQUIPMENT WHEN IT COMES OUT OF WARRANTY, THAT IS OUR BURDEN TO CARRY FORWARD.
00:26:47.068: >> I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT UP THE GRANT BECAUSE THAT WAS ANOTHER QUESTION, WHETHER WE APPLIED TRY TO USE STATE AND FEDERAL GRANTS TO HELP PAY FOR THESE THINGS. BUT I WON'T DEBATE THIS FOR VERY MUCH LO LONGER AND APPRECIATE THE INFORMATION ON IT. I'M CURIOUS TO KNOW ABOUT THE PAVERS, TOO. IT SEEMS LIKE THEY'RE NOT VERY OLD. ALREADY REPLACING. I'M JUST WONDERING WHAT THE ISSUES ARE WITH THAT, IF I COULD MICROMANAGE FOR A SECOND.
00:27:11.358: >> I THINK THE BEST THING IS FOR US TO RESPOND TO THAT AS A QUESTION FROM COUNCIL. I DON'T HAVE THE DETAIL ON THE PROJECT.
00:27:18.766: >> SOUND GOOD.
00:27:21.569: >> GOING BACK TO THE TABULATORS, THERE ARE SOME ISSUES, SOME -- ITEMS GOING BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE ABOUT LETTING US STARTING TO COUNT THE ABSENTEE BALLOTS EARLIER, WHICH WOULD HELP AS OPPOSED TO AFTER THE POLLS CLOSE. AND THAT WOULD -- OR EVEN SAME DAY. SO THAT WOULD HELP THERE AS WELL. CERTAINLY WE'LL PURSUE STATE FUNDING. WE'RE NOT THE ONLY MUNICIPALITY THAT WILL BE HIM PACTED BY EQUIPMENT COMING OUT FROM UNDER WARRANTY AS WELL SO KNOWING IT LAYS OUT ON THE HORIZON, WE CAN ADD THAT TO THINGS WE WILL LOOK AT FOR THE STATE LEARN.
00:27:59.039: >> COUNCIL NELSON AND THEN PERHAPS WE CAN MOVE ON.
00:28:05.412: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON: I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT 15, LOOKING AT CAREER PROGRESSION. I AM INTERESTED IN MORE EXPLANATION OF THAT, PARTICULARLY THE DEVELOPMENT SUPERVISORS AND SOME EXPLANATION OF WHAT THAT IS.
00:28:21.095: >> THE FIRST BULLET THERE ARE SOME CALLS TO DEVELOP SOME TRAINING THE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT TERMS. THE SECOND IS THE FULLY LOADED COST SHOULD WE ADD A DEVELOPMENT SUPERVISOR THAT MAY NOT SURVIVE THE PRIORIZATION EFFORT SO WE MAY NOT HAVE THE FTE. AT THIS POINT WE ARE PRESENTING TO YOU ALL THE IMPACTS TO STAFF AS IDENTIFIED SO IT'S REALLY FISCALLY UNCONSTRAINED RIGHT NOW.
00:28:48.389: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON: WELL, I GUESS I'M CURIOUS. WHAT IS -- WHAT IS IMPLEMENTING NON-UNION CAREER PROGRESSION? WHAT IS THAT?
00:28:56.197: >> A COUPLE YEARS AGO, WE DID A NON-UNION COMPENSATION STUDY AND PROVIDED SOME RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW PEOPLE CAN ADVANCE THROUGH THEIR CAREERS. A PART OF THAT IS DEVELOPING A PROFESSIONAL TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT PLAN FOR NON-UNION STAFF. WE DON'T HAVE THOSE MATERIALS OR CAPABILITIES RIGHT NOW. AND IF WE DON'T ADD AN EMPLOYEE, WE WILL HAVE TO LOOK AND SEE WHAT THE LOAD SON THE OTHER HR STAFF AND SEE HOW WE CAN RESPREAD THE WORK LOAD TO PAY ATTENTION TO THAT ASPECT OF DEVELOPMENT, EMPLOYEE DEVELOPMENT. SO THERE ARE ITEMS THAT ADDRESS TECHNICAL COMPETENCIES AND ORGANIZATIONAL COMPETENCIES AND IN ORDER TO TIE CAREER ADVANCEMENT BEYOND MIDPOINT IN THIS SCALE, WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO TRACK EACH EMPLOYEE'S DEVELOPMENT HISTORY AND THE TRAINING THEY ACCOMPLISH AS WELL AS THE OTHER FACTORS THAT WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO THEIR ADVANCEMENT.
00:30:01.695: >> SO WE WOULD BE HIRING SOMEBODY TO OVERSEE THE TRAINING AND ADVANCEMENT PERSONALLY OF CITY EMPLOYEES.
00:30:08.469: >> THAT'S WHAT THE ASK IS, YES.
00:30:10.638: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON: OKAY. THANK YOU.
00:30:16.076: >> WHEN YOU SAY "ASK," YOU MEAN THAT IS THE --
00:30:22.082: >> WE HAVE PROVIDED COUNCIL WITH ALL THE IMPACT STATEMENTS STAFF HAS PROVIDED WITHOUT EDITING THEM OR TAKING THEM OFF OF CONSIDERATION. WE'RE CLEARLY, AS MR. CRAWFORD SHOWED IN THE PREVIOUS SLIDE, WE WON'T BE ABLE TO FUND ALL THE IMPACTS SO I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHERE THIS RANKS, IT'S PROBABLY MORE TOWARDS THE UNFUNDED REQUIREMENTS RIGHT NOW.
00:30:44.038: >> THANK YOU.
00:30:44.772: >> CITY ADMIN. LAZARUS: YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST -- IN LOOKING AT A PRIORITIZEDDED  A APPROACH TO BUDGET BEING, WE WANT COUNCIL'S FEEDBACK ON WHAT WE HAVE IDENTIFIED.
00:30:55.816: >> COUNCILMEN LUMM.
00:31:00.220: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM: THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE YOU ASKING ABOUT THE SUPERVISOR FTE REQUEST. AND I WOULD JUST SAY -- I APPRECIATE HEARING MORE ABOUT WHAT IS CONTEMPLATED IN TERMS OF WHAT THIS INDIVIDUAL WOULD DO, AND EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT IS IMPORTANT. BUT I WILL SAY IT SEEMS TO ME -- I DON'T KNOW. IT'S MORE OF THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE INDIVIDUAL DEPARTMENTS, MANAGERS, AND SUPERVISORS -- NOT HR -- AND SO I -- AND I ALSO DON'T KNOW HOW THE STAFFING LEVELS IN OUR HR DEPARTMENT COMPARE WITH COMPARABLE CITY SO IF YOU CAN ADDRESS THAT TONIGHT OR SPEAK TO THAT LATER, THESE OBSERVATIONS ABOUT THE POSITION AND OUR STAFFING AND WHETHER THE PLAN WOULD BE TO WAIT UNTIL WE HAVE THE NEW HR DIRECTOR BEFORE MAKING ANY DECISIONS ON STAFFING OR HIRING AND HR. AND AN INTERESTING THING ABOUT FTEs -- IN LOOKING AT THE BUDGET HIM PACT SHEET, WE HAVE BUDGET REQUESTS FOR TEN NEW FTEs. IS THAT CORRECT?
00:32:11.125: >>
00:32:11.492: >> CITY ADMIN. LAZARUS: SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT.
00:32:12.760: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM: SO CAN YOU REMIND ME HOW MANY FTES WE ADDED TO THE FISCAL YEAR '20 BUDGET? AND DURING THE YEAR? BECAUSE I RECALL, OF COURSE, WE ADDED A POLICE AUDIT MANAGER AND FTE AND SUSTAINABILITY OFFICE. THOSE WERE BUDGET AMENDMENTS BUT CAN'T REMEMBER IF WE ADDED MORE BEYOND THOSE TWO. AGAIN, IF -- AS A FOLLOW-UP, THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. AND I WILL HAVE MORE QUESTIONS LATER ON THE SUBSEQUENT SLIDES. BUT JUST -- YOU KNOW, AND THANK YOU FOR ALL THIS INFORMATION AND THE WORK THAT WENT INTO IT. BUT JUST A COMMENT ON THE GENERAL FUND REVENUE. THE COMMENT IS IT LOOKS LIKE FISCAL YEAR '21 WILL BE ANOTHER YEAR OF HEALTHY REVENUE, WHICH IS A VERY GOOD THING. THE SLIDE NUMBER FOUR WHERE WE REFERENCED -- THERE'S A BULLET THERE WHERE WE HAVE OPERATING MILLAGE AND WE SAY IT'S FALLING BECAUSE IT'S FALLING OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS BECAUSE THE MILLAGE IS FALLEN. THAT'S JUST REALLY MISLEADING AND I MEAN, FOCUSING, WE WOULD CONCLUDE THE REVENUES HAVE DECLINED WHEN THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE AND REVENUE GROWTH HAS BEEN VARO BUST AND INCREASED 15% OVER THAT PERIOD. IT'S NOT A HUGE DEAL BUT I JUST THINK WE SHOULD BE MORE CAREFUL ABOUT WHAT WE PUT IN SOME OF THESE SLIDES BECAUSE I THINK ANYONE'S TAKEAWAY FROM THAT WOULD BE -- YEAH, SAYING THE MILLAGE HAS FALLEN IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS -- OH, THE REVENUE COULD BE FALLING. IT'S TECHNICALLY CORRECT BUT COULD BE MISLEADING FOR FOLKS. THANKS.
00:34:01.168: >> THANK YOU. CTN IS IN THE BUDGET. THANK YOU. I WOULD LIKE TO TURN THIS OVER TO MR. CRAWFORD TO GO THROUGH FINANCIAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES.
00:34:22.589: >> AS WE DO THAT, I WANT TO MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND EXACTLY -- WHEN WE SEE PROPOSED BUDGET IMPACTS, FUNDAMENTALLY IT IS NOT YOUR SUSPENSION AS ADMINISTRATOR -- YOUR INTENTION AS ADMINISTRATOR TO PRESENT THESE SET OF SERVICES AND THESE SET OF EXPENDITURES IN ADMINISTRATOR'S BUDGET. WE ARE BEING PRESENTED WITH A SET OF OPTIONS, WHICH EXCEED WHAT YOU THINK IS REASONABLE FOR US TO REQUEST. YOUR GOAL IS TO GO THROUGH THESE OPTIONS AND MAKE SELECTIONS, IDENTIFY PRIORITIES YOU WILL REFLECT. SO NO UNDER NO CONCEIVABLE CIRCUMSTANCE WILL ALL THE BUCKET P BUDGET IMPACTS BE IN ADMINISTRATOR'S BUDGET. IS THAT CORRECT.
00:35:08.235: >> CITY ADMIN. LAZARUS: THAT'S CORRECT. WE SENT OUT A SPREADSHEET THAT SHOWED THE THE IMPACTS BROKEN INTO CATEGORIES AND ATTACHED WITH A DESCRIPTION WITH WHAT THE IMPACTS ARE. YOU SEE THE CATEGORIES UNDERNEATH THE BLUE BAR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TABLE. WE'RE CARRYING OVER $3,500,000 PLUS FROM LAST YEAR OF ONE--- $500,000 PLUS FROM LAST YEAR OF ONE-TIME IMPACT. THERE ARE SOME IMPACTS WITH ASSOCIATED REVENUE RELATED TO THE COMMISSION AND FIRE GRANT AND SOME OTHER STAFF CHANGES AND IF YOU DON'T -- AGAIN, AS TOM SAID, THEY ARE NET ZERO, THE COST AND REVENUE OFFSET EACH OTHER. BUT TO SHOW THE TRUE IMPACT OF THE GENERAL FUND PUBLIC, THEY'RE INCLUDED. AND CORE SERVICES ARE HAVE TO MEET DIRECTION WHERE COUNCIL TOLD US TO DO SOME THINGS. IF THOSE ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET, WE WILL NEED SOME CHANGE IN THE POLICY DIRECTION WE GOT FROM COUNCIL TO NOT INCLUDE THEM. AFTER THAT, COUNCIL HAS GONE THROUGH THEIR PRIORITY EXERCISE AND THOSE HIGH PRIORITY COMMITMENTS ARE WHAT ARE SHOWN ON NEXT LINE DOWN. AS MR. CRAWFORD SAID, THERE ARE SOME IMPACTS AND GENERALLY -- THEY'RE MOSTLY ONE-TIME BUT IF THERE ARE THINGS THAT WE SEE AT THE END OF THE YEAR, WE HAVE AN INCREASE IN THE FUND BALANCE, WE CAN COME BACK TO COUNCIL AND ASK TO INCLUDE THOSE. WE MAY SEE THEM ALL BEFORE THE COUNCIL HAS ADOPTED. IT MAY BE FOR THE BUDGET ADOPTED BY COUNCIL AND MAY REQUIRE A BUDGET AMENDMENT TO BRING THEM BACK IN AND THAT IS A BALANCING BETWEEN HOW MUCH WILL BE IN THE UNRESTRICTED FUND BALANCE AND HOW MUCH TO PUT FORWARD AND AT THE VERY BOTTOM ARE SOME IMPACTS THAT ON THE SPREAD SHEET YOU'LL SEE THEY'RE JUST NOT HIGH PRIORITY ENOUGH TO COMPETE AGAINST THE OTHER REQUIREMENTS. ON THE SPREAD SHEET THAT YOU HAVE, WHAT WE'RE ASKING IS FOR YOU TO RANK WHAT ARE THOSE AND SEE IF YOU AGREE WITH THE FIRST CUT WE HAVE TAKEN AT THEM. THE BOLD LINE ABOVE THE BLUE LINE ON THE CHART SHOWS HOW MUCH IS AVAILABLE FOR US TO BALANCE THE BUDGET WITHOUT DIPPING IN THE FUND BALANCE.
00:37:39.219: >> THANK YOU.
00:37:45.625: >> COULD I FOLLOW ON TO THAT?
00:37:48.095: >> YEAH, COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
00:37:54.501: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM: THANKS. TO FOLLOW ON THAT THOUGHT -- WE CAN'T AFFORD ALL OF THAT. THE REQUESTS ARE HUGE SO WE WERE GIVEN AN IMPACT PRIORIZATION EXERCISE AND WE HAVE DECISIONS TO MAKE ON PRIORITIES AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY THESE WORK SESSIONS PROVIDE FOR ALL OF US AND TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THIS DETAIL AND APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH IN ON THE REQUEST WITH THE BUDGET PRIORIZATION EXERCISE YOU ASKED US TO COMPLETE AND I HOPE WE DO DO THAT. NORMALLY THE SECOND YEAR'S ROUTINE -- THIS IS ANYTHING BUT BECAUSE A LOT CHANGED FROM LAST YEAR. WE TOOK REACTION ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND MAKING DECISIONS ON TAXPAYER OWNED ASSETS AND ARE UP TO $50 MILLION AND WE HAVE SET A CARBON NEUTRALITY TARGET AND WILL LEARN MORE ON MARCH 30, I THINK.
00:38:56.096: >> CITY ADMIN. LAZARUS: THAT'S CORRECT.
00:38:57.631: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM: THAT WILL REQUIRE A FINANCIAL COMMITMENT BY THE CITY. AND, AGAIN, AS WE SEE FROM THE MATERIALS YOU GAVE US TONIGHT -- AND THANK YOU FOR ALL THIS. THE REQUESTS FOR FUNDING FROM THE DEPARTMENTS FAR EXCEEDS WHAT WE CAN AFFORD. AGAIN, THAT'S BEFORE WE GET THE CAR UPON NEUTRALITY ACTION PLAN SO. SO IT'S NOT A CASE THIS YEAR WHERE WE ARE TWEAKING THE PLAN THAT WAS ACCOMPLISHED A YEAR AGO. IT'S REALLY MUCH DIFFERENT, I THINK, AND BECAUSE OF THESE SIGNIFICANT THINGS THAT HAVE OCCURRED SINCE WE ADOPTED THE PLAN LAST YEAR, THESE MAJOR SIGNIFICANT THING SO THANKS.
00:39:35.802: >> CITY ADMIN. LAZARUS: YOU'RE WELCOME.
00:39:42.609: >> OKAY. IN THE FINANCIAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES AREA, THERE HASN'T BEEN AN ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE SO THESE ENTITIES REFLECT THE SAME THAT WERE THERE BEFORE. THIS NEXT SLIDE SHOWS THE PRIORITIES FROM YOUR EXERCISE WITH THE TWO TOP ONES BEING DE-RISKING THE PENSION AND OPEB PLANS AND INCREASING SMALL AND LOCAL BUSINESS OUTREACH. THE OTHERS LISTED WERE NOT AS HIGH A PRIORITY. WHEN WE LOOK AT WHERE THOSE ACTIVITIES WERE TO OCCUR, THIS IS THE PROBLEMATIC KIND OF ALLOCATION MR. LAZARUS WAS REFERRING TO EARLIER --  I WON'T LINGER ON THIS. I'LL GET TO THE IMPACTS. SO HOW WOULD WE MEASURE OURSELVES FOR PRIORITIES THAT WERE IDENTIFIED? A COUPLE OF SUGGESTIONS FOR DERISKING THE SYSTEM. ONE IS REPORT BACK ON THE STATUS OF THE ANALYSIS FOR DERISKING THE PLANS. WE COULD ALSO MEASURE HOW MUCH OF AN INCREASE WOULD THE CITY'S -- IF WE LOOK AT RISK AS MEASURED BY HOW MUCH THE CITY'S CONTRIBUTIONS CHANGE. WE COULD LOOK AT WHAT THE FORECASTED PERCENTAGE INCREASE IS IN THE CITY'S CONTRIBUTION IF OUR RETURNS ARE 1% LOWER THAN WE PLANNED. AND FOR SMALL AND LOCAL BUSINESS OUTREACH, WE COULD DEVELOP A METRIC WHICH REPORTS THE -- HOW MUCH OF OUR PROCUREMENT OCCURS FROM BUSINESSES AND TOWN AS THE TOP PRIORITIES. AND IMPROVING FINANCE PARTIAL REPORTING, WHICH IS LOWER -- A BIG ONE WE WILL WORK ON AND MAY HELP INFORM YOU IS YOU LOOK FOR WAYS THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS YOUR TOP PRIORITY. IS THIS BASE BUDGETS? THAT WILL BE A SIGNIFICANT EFFORT WE PURSUE OVER THE NEXT YEAR, AS WELL AS METRICS YOU HAVE SEEN BEFORE WHERE WE TRY TO DELIVER A REPORT THAT RECEIVES THE INDUSTRY AWARDS, AS WELL AS ASSURING WE DON'T HAVE SPECIAL CONTROL OR DEFICIENCIES. SO AS FAR AS FINANCIAL IMPACTS,, I MENTIONED THIS $500,000 FOR THE SYSTEM. THIS WOULD HELP US RATCHETING UP AND I THINK MAKE PROGRESS IN DERISKING. IF WE DEFINE DE-RISKING AS HAVING LESS TOLL TILLTY IN THE CITY'S CONTRIBUTIONS, THIS WOULD HELP US ACHIEVE THAT END. AND ALSO AS FAR AS THE CITY TALKED WITH SPARK ABOUT LEADING A REVERSE PROCUREMENT INITIATIVE. WHAT THAT BASICALLY IS -- NORMALLY WHEN THE CITY DOES SOMETHING, WE'LL ISSUE THE WORD THAT THIS IS THE SERVICE OR PRODUCT WE WANT AND EVERYBODY BID AND LET US KNOW. WE SIT DOWN AND INVITE COMPANIES IN AND TELL US HOW TO SOLVE OUR PROBLEMS. THAT CAN BE A WAY WE LEARN NEW THINGS AND WERE NOT AWARE OF THAT ARE OUT THERE IN ORDER TO ADDRESS OUR PROBLEMS. I WILL ASK ANOTHER PERSON TO TALK ABOUT IMPACTS IN I.T. FROM A FINANCIAL STANDPOINT FOR ALL THE SERVICES, DEMOCRATS, AND FINANCE. WE DON'T HAVE ANY SERVICE IMPACTS. ALL OF THE IMPACTS IN MY AREA ARE IN I.T. FOR THIS YEAR.
00:43:04.544: >> HI, EVERYBODY. THE I.T. DEPARTMENT HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO SOME RESTRUCTURING. SINCE I HAVE BEEN HERE, WE HAVE BEEN PRETTY TOP HEAVY ON SENIOR LEVEL FOLKS AND HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY THROUGH SOME RETIREMENTS -- BOTH RECENT ONE AND OLDER ONES -- TO MAKE SOME CHANGES. THE STRATEGY IS TO -- WE HAVE A SENIOR-LEVEL PERSON THAT WILL BE RETIRING AND INSTEAD OF HIRING A SENIOR LEVEL PERSON, WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS BRING IN SOME JUNIOR, MIDLEVEL PEOPLE. SO ON THE SLIDE IT REFLECTS THE HIRING OF A HELP DESK SPECIALIST, AND WE WILL BE TAKING THESE POSITIONS AND SLICING THEM UP. AND WE WILL USE A HELP DESK POSITION FOR PART OF THAT SENIOR-LEVEL PERSON'S JOB. ANOTHER APPLICATION SPECIALIST THAT IS CURRENTLY ON STAFF. AND THAT WILL GIVE US AN OPPORTUNITY TO HIRE SOME OTHER PEOPLE IN SOME OTHER AREAS WE HAVE A NEED AND WILL SHOW UP IN HORIZON ISSUES ON THE NEXT SLIDE. ONE IS ADDING AN FTE FOR AN INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEER, AND WHAT THIS WILL ALLOW US TO DO IS TO GIVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE MANAGER ASSISTANCE TO FOCUS ON SECURITY. A HORIZON ISSUE IS SECURITY. CYBER SECURITY IS, AS YOU KNOW, VERY COMPLEX AND KEEPS ESCALATING AND WE CONTINUE TO DEPLOY MORE TOOLS TO MITIGATE AND WILL GET WORSE AS TIME GOES BY SO WE WANT TO ALLOW THE MANAGER TO DO THAT AND FREE UP TIME TO GIVE SOME ADMINISTRATIVE DUTIES TO ANOTHER MIDLEVEL PERSON.
00:44:39.706: >>> AND THE LAST PERSON ON THERE IS AN APPLICATION SPECIALIST OR BUSINESS ANALYSTED A MIDLEVEL POSITION. THAT ALLOWS THE APPLICATION DELIVERY MANAGER TO FOCUS ON THE BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE TOOL WE PURCHASED AND TO BUILD OUR DA DATA-DRIVEN CITY INITIATIVE, WHICH IS THE YELLOW FIN BUSINESS INTELLIGENT TOOL WE PURCHASED. THAT WILL BE ANOTHER HORIZON ISSUE MOVING FORWARD. SO THE NET OF THIS IS WE WILL BE TAKING SOME OF THE FUNDS FROM THE PREVIOUS RETIREMENTS AND EQUATES TO US EXCEEDING -- TO ADDITIONAL EXPENDITURES OF $55,000 TO OUR BUDGET AND PLAN ON SPREADING THAT COST THROUGH THE I.T. CHARGE TO THE DEPARTMENTS THAT IT AFFECTS MOST. QUESTIONS? YES.
00:45:47.507: >> YOU HAVE THE RETIREMENT OF THE SENIOR LEVEL PERSON AS A ONE-TIME EXPENSE. IF THEY DIDN'T RETIRE, YOU WOULD BE PAYING THAT PER YEAR, WOULDN'T YOU?
00:45:55.281: >> YEAH. WELL, THE NEW EXPENSE OR REPLACEMENT IS REOCCURRING.
00:45:58.585: >> OKAY.
00:46:00.386: >> SO YEAH. IT'S LISTED AS ONE TIME BUT BECOMES REOCCURRING IN THE NEW POSITIONS.
00:46:06.793: >> THANK YOU.
00:46:12.365: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM: I WAS AT ONE OF YOUR TALKS ABOUT SMART CITIES AND SO I'M WONDERING WHERE SMART CITIES FITS INTO THIS CHART.
00:46:20.807: >> IT FITS INTO IT GREATLY. THE BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE, THE FIBER INITIATIVE, THAT WE CONTINUE TO BUILD OUT THROUGHOUT THE CITY ALLOWS US TO CONNECT DEVICES AND IN ORDER FOR YOU TO HAVE A SMART -- IN ORDER TO HAVE A SMART CITY OR DO SMART INITIATIVES, YOU HAVE TO HAVE A FEW THING. ONE, YOU HAVE TO HAVE POWER. YOU HAVE TO HAVE CONNECTIVITY. YOU HAVE TO HAVE A MANAGEMENT TOOL, WHICH IS AN IOT PLATFORM TO MANAGE REMOTELY SO WE DON'T HAVE TO EXPAND MANUAL RESOURCES DOING BE SO AND THE LAST IS THE TOOL TO CAPTURE THE DATA AND DELIVER IT TO THE BUSINESS TO MAKE GOOD BUSINESS DECISIONS. OUR GOAL IS TO BECOME DATA RICH AND REALLY UNIT THAT DATA TO BECOME MORE OPERATIONALLY EFFICIENT AND TO SAVE MONEY SO IT ALL TIES IN. THERE'S A WHOLE STRATEGY BEHIND IT, AND I KNOW WE WILL TALK ABOUT SMART CITIES IN FUTURE, BUT THESE TOOLS REALLY TIE INTO TEACH OTHER. AND IF YOU TAKE ONE OF THEM OUT, IT'S PROBLEMATIC IN ACHIEVING WHAT WE WANT TO.
00:47:33.313: >> OH, OKAY. WILL THERE BE ANY SOFTWARE COSTS?
00:47:40.219: >> YES.
00:47:40.520: >> IN THE NEXT BUDGET? OKAY.
00:47:42.755: >> WELL, AGAIN IF AS WE REMEDIATE OUR SYSTEMS, AS WE UP GRADE OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AND ASSETS THAT WE HAVE OUT IN THE FIELD, THE YOU KNOW, THOSE COSTS WILL COME WITH THOSE PROJECTS AND WILL SNAP INTO THE MODEL WE'RE BUILDING SO, YEAH, THERE WILL BE A COST BUT WILL BE COST SAVINGS AS A RESULT, AND THOSE SHOULD BE REALIZED WHEN, YOU KNOW, BEFORE WE EVEN GO AND PURSUE AN OPPORTUNITY.
00:48:10.717: >> OKAY, GREAT.
00:48:12.118: >> THANKS. THANKS. I CERTAINLY SUPPORT FINDING OFFSETS AND YOU HAVE DONE THAT TO PIERCE THE POSITION AGAIN FUNDED BY THE DIFFERENCE IN THE SALARY OF THE RETIRING PERSON AND LOWER SALARY REPLACEMENT. IN GENERAL, I THINK IT SHOULD BE IN MERIT TO THE NEED AND YOU HAVE BEEN EXPLAINING THAT WITH THE HORIZON CHALLENGES AND WHAT THE NEED ARE. SO IN TERMS OF SPEAKING TO THE NEED FOR ADDING THE INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEER AT THIS POINT, WHAT HAS CHANGED IN TERMS OF WORKLOAD?
00:48:51.424: >> IT'S THE SECURITY.
00:48:52.358: >> IT'S THE SECURITY?
00:48:54.961: >> YEAH. THE CYBER SECURITY. WE SPEND TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF TIME ON CYBER SECURITY. CYBER SECURITY IS PERVASIVE TO OUR AT THIS POINT AND FALLS ON EVERY AREA WE DO, BUT WE NEED SOMEBODY TO FOCUS ON SECURITY IN THE CITY AND REALLY FOCUS ON IT. THIS WILL GIVE OUR INFRASTRUCTURE MANAGER THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO. IF WE DO NOT DO THAT THERE ARE CHIEF INFORMATION SECURITY OFFERS, C.I.S.O.s, HIRED TO DO THAT PARTICULAR TASK, AND THEY ARE SIX-FIGURE MINIMUM SALARIES AND ARE EXTREMELY HARD TO FIND. THERE'S VIRTUALLY NO UNEMPLOYMENT IN THE SECURITY REALM SO OUR STRATEGY IS TO DO OUR SECURITY ACROSS OUR DEPARTMENTS AND THE ALTERNATIVE IS TO GO HIGHER THAN ONE OF THOSE C.I.S.O.s TO DO THAT EXCLUSIVELY.
00:49:49.816: >> OKAY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
00:49:53.553: >> I WILL JUST WRAP UP BY TOUCHING BASE ON THE HORIZON, THE OTHER HORIZON ISSUES IN THE SERVICE AARON AREA IN ADDITION TO THE ONES ALREADY MENTIONED. ON A FINANCIAL BASIS, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE BEEN DOING SUCCESSION PLANNING FOR SOME TIME. THE IMPLEMENTATION, WE'RE IN THE THROES OF THAT RIGHT NOW AND WILL BE SOMETHING THAT GOES THROUGH THE NEXT YEAR AND PROBABLY TWO FOR SURE. THE PRIORITY BASED BUDGETING -- THIS IS AN IMPORTANT TOOL FOR YOU GUYS AND THE STAFF AND WILL TAKE -- THAT'S A BIG INITIATIVE, AS IS DERISKING THE FAN. THE OTHER THING WE WILL DO AS WE GO FORWARD IS THE BUSINESS SPACES AND SUPPORTING THEIR DEVELOPMENT TO MAKE SURE WHETHER IT'S CLIMATE OR SOLID WASTE WE HAVE SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS MODELS PUT IN PLACE. THAT IS ALL THAT WE HAVE. CHIEF KENNEDY IS YOUR NEXT CANDIDATE FOR FIRE.
00:50:58.184: >> OKAY. GOOD EVENING, MAYOR AND COUNCIL. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TONIGHT. LOOKING AT THE SAFETY SERVICES STRUCTURE, FIRE AND THEN F.C. FORSBURG AND THEN EMERGENCY IS UNDER THE FIRE DEPARTMENT. WE ARE NOT ASKING FOR THE FIRE FOR ANY INCREASE IN FTEs OR ORGANIZATIONAL IMPACT WITH OUR PUBLIC FOR FY 21. GOING ALONG WITH THE THEME, IT SHOWS THE PRIORITIES FROM COUNCIL WITH THE GREENS AND THE APPLE PER AND THE RED. I HOPE TO PROVIDE MORE BACKGROUND ON THE RED ONE THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED IN DECEMBER WITH THE POTENTIAL NEED TO UP GRADE OUR SERVICES TO AN AMBULANCE TRANSPORT UNIT. THE BREAKDOWN OF BUDGET FOR THE FIRE DEPARTMENT -- SO THAT 20% GOING TOWARDS ADMINISTRATION. THE FOCUS OF THAT WITH THE ACCELERATION OF THE FIRE STATION REPLACEMENTS AND INCREASE IN DIVERSITY. EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT IS ONE FTE FOR US. FIRE OPERATIONS -- 72 FTEs ARE ALLOCATED OUT OF OUR 87 SO THAT IS THE BULK OF OUR EXPENDITURE. AND FOR FIRE PREVENTION, SIX PERSONNEL ASSIGNED THERE, ONE MANAGEMENT ASSISTANT, ONE FIRE MARSHALL, AND FOUR FIRE INSTRUCTORS. SO THE PREPAREDNESS RFP FOR STATION 4 IS A HOPE FOR FISCAL ' 21. I'M EXCITED TO SHARE SOMETHING AT THE END OF THE PRESENTATION REGARDING THAT. PART OF THAT WILL BE -- OR PART OF THE MASTER PLAN WILL BE TO RELOCATE FIRE PREVENTION FROM ITS CURRENT SITE AT STATION 2 TO STATION 1, WHICH WILL FREE UP THE CREW AT STATION 4 TO RELOCATE THERE DURING THE CONSTRUCTION PERIOD. SO ALL PART OF THE CHESS GAME THAT IS GOING ON WITH THE FIRE STATION MASTER PLAN. IN TERMS OF DIVERSITY, AS MR. LASS RUSS POINTED TO YOU, BETTER OUTREACH AND BETTER DEMOCRATIC PROFILE. THE FIRE CADET PROGRAM IS SOMETHING WE CURRENTLY HAVE FUNDING FOR AND HOPE TO HAVE THAT POSTED THIS SPRING. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH HR TO IDENTIFY BOTH POSITION DESCRIPTION AND POSTING DESCRIPTION ON THAT. AND FOR EMERGENCY OUTLINES, WE'RE CONTINUING TO REFINE OUR FIRE INSPECTION EFFICIENCIES AND IN TERM OF RESPONSE TIMES, JUST WORK ON LOWERING THOSE AND MEETING THE POLES OUTLINED IN THE FIRE STATION MASTER PLAN. AS MR. CRAWFORD MENTIONED, THE $500,000 ALLOCATED IN THIS SLIDE WOULD BE FOR THE ACTUAL RFP FOR ARCHITECT JULY TO DO THE DESIGN FOR -- THE BUILD DESIGN FOR STATION 4 AND $150,000 TO RENOVATE THE SPACE THAT IS GOING TO BE VACATED BY WASHTENAW COUNTY DISPATCH WHEN THEY MOVE FROM CURRENT STATION 1 TO A NEW FACILITY ON ZEEB ROAD AND ARE EXPECTED TO BE OUT BY THIS TIME NEXT YEAR. THEIR INTENTION IS BY THE END OF 2020 WITH KIND OF SOME FLEX TO BE OUT BY THIS TIME NEXT YEAR. FROM DIVERSITY, THAT IS A RECURRING EXPENSE AND FOR EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS AND CURRENT EXPENSE -- THAT INCLUDE THE PAYROLL AND ALL THE OTHER ADJUNCT FACILITIES THAT GOES WITH EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AND THE $12,600, WE HAVE A CURRENT FIRE INSPECTION SOFTWARE THAT HAS BEEN ONLINE FOR JUST ABOUT TEN MONTHS NOW. THAT IS TO HELP WITH SCHEDULING FOR SOME EFFICIENCIES FOR OUR STAFF. THE OTHER IMPACTS THAT AREN'T LISTED AS A ONE-TIME -- AND THIS IS FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BASIC LIFE SUPPORT TRANSPORT TO REPLACE OUR CURRENT LIGHT-DUTY RESCUE. THIS HAS BECOME THE BUSIEST UNIT IN THE CITY. WE HAVE HAD IT ONLINE NOW FOR ABOUT 18 MONTHS AND WENT FROM A NON-EXISTENT RIG TO THE BUSIEST RIG. SO IT IS MORE THAN IMPROVE IN MERIT. WE ARE NOT ASKING FOR INCREASE OF STAFF WITH THIS. AND SOME FURTHER METRICS THAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN SINCE I LAST WAS BEFORE YOU IN DECEMBER -- OVER 158 DAYS WE HAVE EXPERIENCED 132 DELAYS. THE AVERAGE DELAY THAT WE ARE WAITING ON SCENE FOR HV IS 16 MINUTES, FOR THOSE 132 DELAYS AND OUR ON-SCENE TIME HAS BEEN 1804 MINUTES OVER THE LAST 158 DAYS. SO THIS DELAYS ARE HAVING SOME TREMENDOUS IMPACT CITY-WIDE OF OUR STAFF ON SCENE WITH THE PATIENT REQUIRING TRANSPORT AND THERE IS A DELAY OF A TRANSPORT RIG. AND THIS IS NOT TO REPLACE HVA. IT IS WORK IN PARTNERSHIP SO WHEN THEY GO TO ZERO STATUS OR HAVE DELAYS, WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO KIND OF CATCH THEM UP AND NOT ONLY GREECE UP FIRE RESOURCES AND FREES UP HVA AS WELL. THE UP GRADE WITH -- SORRY, WAS THERE A QUESTION?
00:56:31.150: >> JUST A CLARIFYING POINT. SO THE NEED FOR THE UP GRADE IS A RESULT OF OUR PERSONNEL GOING ON SITE, DELIVERING THE FIRST ROUND OF TREATMENT, AND WAITING FOR AN PLANS FROM HVA TO TAKE THEM TO THE HOSPITAL.
00:56:44.196: >> YES, SIR.
00:56:45.431: >> AND HVA CURRENTLY -- OUR CONTRACT DOESN'T PROVIDE ENOUGH SUPPORT BECAUSE OF A DELAY.
00:56:51.937: >> SO WE DO NOT HAVE A CONTRACT WITH THEM. HVA HAS A SERVICE AGREEMENT IS PROBABLY THE BEST WAY I COULD SAY, FOR THE ENTIRE COUNTY. THERE IS NOT A SPECIFIC ADVANCED LIFE SUPPORT CONTRACT BETWEEN THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR AND THE PLANS SO THERE'S NOT A DIRECT CONTRACT WE COULD HAVE BUT IS ON A COUNTY LEVEL. THERE IS AN ISSUE WITH LACK OF PERSONNEL GOING INTO THE FIELD OF EMS AND IS NOT UNIQUE TO HVA SO IT'S NOT AN INDICTMENT ON THEM. IT WOULD BE ANY PRIVATE EMS PROVIDERS DEALING WITH SIMILAR ISSUES.
00:57:30.609: >> OKAY. SO BY ADDING THIS $83,000 A YEAR -- OH, SORRY.
00:57:38.083: >> IT'S A ONE-TIME PURCHASE TO -- CURRENTLY CREWS RESPONDING BASICALLY A MODIFIED PICKUP TRUCK AND SO THIS WOULD PUT THEM IN AN AMBULANCE SO WHEN WE HAVE THOSE TIMES, THEY CAN TRANSPORT AND ARE NOT KEEPING CREWS ON SCENE.
00:57:52.631: >> SO I WAS COMPLAINING ON THOSE TWO LINE ITEMS --
00:57:56.635: >> YES, EMERGENT HEALTH PARTNERS. THEY'RE THE UMBRELLA CORPORATION. THE SECOND LINE DEALS WITH FIRE DISPATCH, WHICH EMERGENT HEALTH PARTNERS ALSO DOES, AND WE ARE LOOKING TO RECEIVE INCREASED SERVICE AND OBVIOUSLY IF WE WILL LOOK FOR INCREASED SERVICE, THAT WILL HAVE A PRICE ATTACHED TO IT.
00:58:14.653: >> OKAY. SO FIRST LINE ITEM, BUY AN AMBULANCE. SECOND LINE ITEM IS INCREASE SERVICE FOR DISPATCHING.
00:58:22.695: >> CORRECTED.
00:58:23.095: >> WHAT IS THE BAY POINT THERE?
00:58:24.396: >> THE CURRENT DISPATCH CONTRACT? IT'S AT 118.
00:58:29.568: >> WHAT IS THE -- WHAT IS LACKING?
00:58:35.341: >> WE'RE DEALING WITH SERVICE EXPECTATIONS AND A CONTRACTS NOT ONLY WITH WAS BUT 13 FIRE DEPARTMENTS IN WASHTENAW COUNTY. WHAT WE'RE FINDING IS WHEN THEY ARE DEALING WITH PEAK CALL TIMES, OUR UNITS ARE CALLING DISPATCH AND NOT GETTING AN ANSWER BECAUSE THE DISPATCHER IS TIED UP, DISPATCHING ANOTHER FIRE DEPARTMENT OR TAKING ADDITIONAL 911 CALLS. THE THE OTHER PART -- SO THAT $83,000, WE'RE STILL IN TALKS WITH THEM. THAT'S A PROJECTED COST. WE WOULD NOT BE EXPECTED TO EXCEED THAT BUT WOULD BE TO ADD SOME PEAK DISPATCHERS ALONG WITH THE FIRE DISPATCH SUPERVISOR, WHICH THEY DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE.
00:59:18.584: >> OKAY. I'M SORRY.
00:59:20.753: >> YOU'RE FINE.
00:59:24.757: >> WHAT IS YOUR SENSE -- HOW MUCH IS THE ISSUE THEY HAVE A BROAD SET OF LOCAL CLIENTS WITH COMPETING NEEDS VERSUS WE NEED TO INCREASE OUR CONTRACT SIZE? ARE WE REALLY MAXES OUT OUR CURRENT CONTRACT AS IT IS NOW? IT'S JUST A UNIQUE SITUATION IN WHICH THEY HAVE A LOT OF CLIENTS USING THE SAME SCREENERS AND DISPATCHERS FROM THE SAME LOCATION.
00:59:52.351: >> IT IS AND IS TOUGH FOR US TO PARS OUT WHAT THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR'S COST IS WITH THAT. WE HAVE DONE A LOT OF COMPARABLES AND BENCHMARKS, AND ALL OF THE BENCHMARKING WE HAVE DONE IN MICHIGAN IS -- WE ARE VERY, INCREDIBLY LOW IN WHAT WE SHOULD BE PAYING. SO I DON'T TAKE THAT AS --
01:00:21.080: >> JUST BECAUSE WE FOUND SOME SWEET DEAL DOESN'T MEAN WE SHOULD SPEND MORE.
01:00:24.316: >> NO, I UNDERSTAND.
01:00:25.317: >> I APPRECIATE THAT.
01:00:26.819: >> I UNDERSTAND. IT'S WE'RE ASKING THEM FOR AN INCREASED LEVEL OF SERVICE AND IN LOOKING WHAT OTHER COMMUNITIES ARE PAYING FOR FIRE DISPATCH, HAVING PARTY FOR OUR PURPOSES AND THEIRS, THAT'S WHY I'M COMFORTABLE THAT IF WE WILL ASK FOR INCREASED SERVICE, THEN WE SHOULD BE PAYING MARKET RATE. I WOULD SAY WE'RE NOT AT MARKET RATE FOR FIRE DISPATCH SERVICES FOR A CITY OUR SIZE.
01:00:50.976: >> OKAY.
01:00:52.745: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
01:00:58.917: >>
01:00:59.051: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD: DO WE HAVE AN ESTIMATED DATE OF GETTING THE TRANSPORT UNIT? I KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT THE NEED TO GET SOMETHING AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.
01:01:05.124: >> THIS IS JUST AN IMPACT, AS MR. LAZARUS SAID. WE HAVE MORE REQUESTS THAN WE HAVE FUNDING SO IT WILL BE UP TO COUNCIL TO PRIORITIZE. THERE'S NOT CURRENT FUNDING FOR THIS.
01:01:17.836: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD: THERE IS -- I KNOW IT IS NEXT YEAR, BUT WE HAD A VERY SPECIFIC DISCUSSION ABOUT THE RISK TO THE SAFETY OF OUR CITIZENS BY NOT HAVING THIS AND HAVING PEOPLE LAYING IN THE STREET OR WHEREVER LIKE THE CYCLIST WAS. IT WAS MY INTENTION WE WOULD MOVE THIS UP AND EVEN THOUGH IT WAS GOING TO BE PAID FOR IN THE NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET BECAUSE IT WAS LIKE AN 18-MONTH DELAY IN GETTING THE UNIT, I'M JUST WONDERING IF WE HAVE DONE ANYTHING TO PREPARE FOR -- YEAH, PREORDER. OR LOOKING TO SEE IF THERE'S A USED UNIT THAT MIGHT BE AVAILABLE.
01:01:59.711: >> SO WE HAVE ASSEMBLED A WORK GROUP.
01:02:03.048: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD: OKAY.
01:02:03.782: >> IF THE DIRECTION FROM COUNCIL AND THE FUNDING IS DIRECTED, WE CAN MOVE IMMEDIATELY ON THAT. WE ARE AT A POSITION TO MOVE, WAITING.
01:02:12.991: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD: OH, OKAY, SO IT IS MIGHT BE HELPFUL FOR US TO PASS A RESOLUTION?
01:02:17.162: >> I DON'T WANT TO GET IN FRONT OF THE BUDGET PROCESS. BUT I -- -- SORRY.
01:02:24.269: >> A LITTLE BIT OF A CHICKEN-AND-EGG ARGUMENT. SO IF COUNCIL GO IN THE DIRECTION TO DO THAT WITH WHAT FUNDING IS AVAILABLE, WE CAN ORDER THAT AND REALIZE WE MADE THE COMMITMENT FOR NEXT YEAR.
01:02:34.646: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD: OKAY, AND THERE IS SOME PREWORK TO DO BEFORE WE WOULD EVEN BUDGET THE ITEM.
01:02:40.586: >> I THINK CHIEF WAS GOING TO STATE WE DEVELOP THE SPECS FOR IT SO WE CAN GO OUT FOR BIDS. THAT PART HAS BEEN DONE.
01:02:46.859: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD: IT'S DONE. OKAY, THANK YOU.
01:02:48.894: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
01:02:50.929: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM: OKAY, SO -- RIGHT. THIS IS A SLIPPERY SLOPE. WE CAN START -- YOU KNOW, PULLING THINGS OFF THE BUDGET THAT --
01:02:57.169: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD: THERE ARE PEOPLE AND BODIES IN THE STREET AND WE WANT TO BE --
01:03:02.074: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
01:03:03.609: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM: I HAVE THE MICROPHONE. THANK YOU.
01:03:06.278: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD: BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT --
01:03:07.746: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM: I --. SO I WOULD LIKE. SO WE HAVE BUDGET PRIORITIES AND EXERCISE. I APPRECIATE THE BUDGET WE WERE GIVEN FOR THE RETREAT AND IT'S NICE TO SEE SOME FEEDBACK FOLDED INTO WHAT IS PRESENTED TONIGHT. AND BUDGET PROTOCOL, BUDGET DISCIPLINE, IS IMPORTANT. YOU KNOW, ON THE NEXT SLIDE, 31 -- YOU KNOW, SO IN THE SECOND WARD, THERE'S A REFERENCE TO CONTINUING DISCUSSIONS WITH THE U OF M ON REPLACEMENT OF FIRE STATION NUMBER FIVE. AND THAT IS LISTED AS -- IT'S ON THE HORIZON SLIDE. I HOPE THAT'S NOT AN INDEXATION OF TIMING AND I WILL ASK YOU FOR AN UPDATE ON THOSE DISCUSSIONS. IT'S JUST ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF MANY THINGS AND IS IN THE PROPOSAL BUT THIS ONE IS ON THE HORIZON ISSUE, WHICH CONCERNS ME. I THINK IN GENERAL -- AND MR. CRAWFORD ALLUDED  TO THIS EARLIER -- THE PRIORITY BASED BUDGETING IS AN INITIATIVE WE ADOPTED IN THE LAST YEAR OR SO AND THAT IS A POSITIVE STEP THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE AND THIS ALL GETS TO, YOU KNOW, ALIGNING SPENDING WITH PRIORITIES AND WHICH I THINK WITH TAXPAYERS' PRIORITIES -- AND I THINK THAT SHOULD BE OUR JOB ONE. AND AS WE KNOW, THE STAFF REQUESTS ARE SIGNIFICANT, AND WE SIMPLY DON'T HAVE THE FUNDS TO FUND EVERYTHING. SO I WOULD JUST ASK THAT WE STAY FOCUSED ON THE TASK AT HAND AND AND WORK WITHIN THE BUDGET PROTOCOL AND PROCESS AND AND DISCIPLINE SOCIETIED WITH THAT.
01:05:15.107: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
01:05:17.275: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD: I HAVE BUDGET DISCIPLINE, BUT I ALSO FEEL THAT THE SAFETY OF OUR CITIZENS IS PARAMOUNT, AND THERE ARE TIMES WHEN WE MAY HAVE TO -- AND I'M NOT SAYING WE'RE GOING TO PAY FOR IT RIGHT NOW. BUT WE NEED TO BE READY AND WE NEED TO REACT. AND IF NECESSARY, I'LL BRING FORWARD A RESOLUTION. I'LL TALK TO STAFF LATER. I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN THIS BUDGET IS APPROVED, WE ARE READY TO GO.
01:05:50.842: >> ALL RIGHT. OKAY. I BELIEVE I'VE -- COVERED THE IMPACTS. SO HORIZON ISSUES -- WE MADE SOME SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTIONS IN OUR FLEET OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS SO THIS IS FOR FISCAL '23. WE HAVE TWO CURRENT RESERVE UNITS. THEY BOTH CURRENT YEAR ARE OVER 15 YEARS OLD AND HAVE OVER 100,000 MILES WHICH, FOR A FIRE TRUCK, IS AN AWFUL LOT OF ROAD TIME. SO THOSE RESERVE UNITS AREN'T SCHEDULED TO BE REPLACED UNTIL '27. I DON'T HAVE CONFIDENCE THEY WILL LAST UNTIL THEN. I SAY "RESERVE UNITS" BECAUSE IF A REGULAR ENGINE GOES OUT OF SERVICE FOR MAINTENANCE, TIRES, D.O.T. INSPECTION, ONE OF THESE RESERVES IS ACTIVATED WHEN WE HAVE SNOW EVENTS OR WHEN WE HAVE LARGE HOME GAMES. WE'LL ACTIVATE A UNIT TO ADD TO CAPACITY SO THESE ARE -- THEY'RE RESERVED. THEY'RE IN A FRONT-LINE SERVICE SO WE NEED TO DEPEND ON THESE SO WE WANT TO REDUCE THE REPLACEMENT CYCLE FROM FISCAL '27, WHICH IS CURRENTLY PLANNED TO FISCAL '23. WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT STATION 4. AFTER THAT,, THE INTENTION WOULD BE FOR STATION 3 AT VETS PARK USING A SIMILAR PLAN, AND AGAIN, LONG-TERM HORIZON WOULD BE THE RENOVATION OR REPLACEMENT OF STATION 1 DOWNTOWN ACROSS THE STREET AND HAVE A PICTURE I'LL SHOW IN A SECOND. SOME VERY INITIAL BALLPARK ESTIMATES TO DO A RENOVATION WOULD BE AROUND $9 MILLION. A TOTAL REPLACEMENT WOULD BE AROUND $18 MILLION. THERE ARE SOME INTERESTING MODELS NATIONALLY IN WASHINGTON, D.C., THAT HAS BECOME A NATIONAL MODEL OF SOME PRIVATE/PUBLIC PARTNERSHIPS, WHICH GIVEN THE LOCATION OF THAT STATION, THE TOWN CORE, I THINK THERE'S SOME REAL OPPORTUNITY THERE. AND COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, TO YOUR POINT, WITH STATION 5, WE ARE CONTINUING CONVERSATIONS ON THAT. THAT HASN'T FALLEN OFF.
01:08:05.143: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM: YEAH. I WILL FOLLOW UP WITH AN UPDATE ON THOSE BECAUSE I GET -- THIS PART OF TOWN, RESPONSE TIMES ARE WORSE. RESPONSE TIMES ARE THE WORST. THIS IS AN AREA THAT'S GROWING SIGNIFICANTLY AND THE U OF M STUDENT POPULATION AND CAMPUS, THIS WILL INCLUDE A THIRD OF THE STUDENT BODY AND WE HAD PRESENTATION FROM U OF H FOLKS. YEAH, THEY'RE GROWING. THE RESEARCH PROPERTY AND NORTH CAMPUS SIGNIFICANTLY AND HERE SITS FIRE STATION NUMBER 5, WHICH SERVICES ALL THE U OF M PROPERTY THAT IS GROWING TREMENDOUSLY. SO HERE IT IS. IT'S ON THE HORIZON SLIDE AND DOESN'T FEEL LIKE IT'S A PRIORITY AND SO WE'LL BE FOLLOWING UP TO GET AN UPDATE ON THOSE DISCUSSIONS AND THIS SHOULD BE A PUBLIC/PUBLIC PARTNERSHIP. I MEAN, U OF M -- YOU KNOW, WRITE US A CHECK, YEAH. YOU ARE SERVING A LOT OF U OF M PROPERTY AND STUDENTS AND STAFF AND, AGAIN, ANN ARBOR COMMUNITY, IN THIS AREA, WHERE THE RESPONSE TIMES ARE THE WORST, IS GROWING BY LEAPS AND BOUNDS.
01:09:42.173: >> AGREE.
01:09:42.907: >> THANKS.
01:09:43.975: >> THANK YOU.
01:09:44.809: >> OKAY, SO SOME EXCITING STUFF. I JUST LITERALLY RECEIVED THESE THIS MORNING SO THIS IS FOR STATION 4, A CONCEPTUAL DRAWING. SO IT'S A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO SEE IN THIS DRAWING BUT THE SLOPE OF THE ROOF IS A TOTAL SOLAR ARRAY AND THE PLAN IS TO BE CUTTING EDGE AND THE HOPE AND PLAN WOULD BE FOR THIS TO BE THE FIRST CARBON-NEUTRAL STATION IN THE STATE OF MICHIGAN SO WE CAN REALLY BE LEADING FROM A STATEWIDE INITIATIVE WITH THE CARBON NEUTRALITY AND OTHER SUSTAINABILITY GOALS. THIS WOULD BE AT THE CURRENT LOCATION, TREMENDOUS AMOUNT -- SO IN ADDITION TO SOLAR, GEOTHERMAL, TREMENDOUS USAGE OF NATURAL LIGHT AND REALLY THINK THAT STATION DOESN'T REALLY ADD TO THE AESTHETICS OF THAT PART OF TOWN AND IS RATHER -- THERE'S NOT MUCH TO IT FROM AN ARCHITECTURAL PERSPECTIVE AND THINK NOT ONLY DOES THIS -- I'M SORRY? YEAH. THIS IS NOT ONLY WILL BE A WONDERFUL PLACE FOR OUR EMPLOYEES TO WORK OUT OF FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 50 YEARS, IT MEETS OUR ENVIRONMENTAL ASPIRATIONS AND REALLY, I THINK, A GREAT SHOW PIECE FOR THAT SECTION OF THE CITY AND THE BUDGET FOR THIS IS FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. SO THAT IS WHERE WE'RE AT. AND THE OTHER PART -- SO D.C. IS NOW -- THEY HAVE DONE THREE OF THESE STATIONS AND THIS WOULD POTENTIALLY WORK FOR STATION ONE DOWNTOWN ACROSS THE STREET. SO THIS STATION IS ACTUALLY THE FIRST TWO FLOORS, A FIRE STATION, AND THEN A SQUASH FACILITY ABOVE THEY HAVE A FIRE STATION AND THEN A HYATT HOTEL AND ARE BUILDING A THIRD THAT WILL BE APARTMENTS WITH TWO OR THREE FLOORS OF THAT BEING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SO THERE'S -- CHICAGO IS IS LOOKING AT DOING A SIMILAR THING BUT THIS -- IN D.C. THE COSTS HAVE BEEN ZERO. SO -- THAT'S KIND OF SOME -- HORIZON THING FOR US TO POTENTIALLY LOOK AT.
01:12:10.889: >> THIS IS A COMMENT. I, BY HAPPENSTANCE, HAPPEN TO BE NEAR THESE. THE I JUST WALKED IN, AND THE FIREFIGHTERS LOVE THE NEW FACILITIES SO JUST AS A POINT OF REFERENCE.
01:12:28.106: >> THERE ARE SOME IDEAS SO INSTEAD OF US HAVING --
01:12:31.276: >> SO THIS IS A PUBLIC/PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP.
01:12:33.912: >> YES, MA'AM. YEP. GIVEN --
01:12:38.049: >> VERY CREATIVE.
01:12:38.716: >> WITH THE DOWNTOWN, THAT LONG TERM FOR STATION 1 COULD BE AN OPTION. I THINK I HAVE TAKEN TOO MUCH TIME. THANK YOU.
01:12:57.502: >> GOOD EVENING.
01:12:58.136: >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
01:12:59.103: >> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. I WILL FLY THROUGH THESE. THE FIRST ARE THE PRIORITIES RANKED YOU HAD FOR US. I THINK WE'RE ONE OF THE ONLY DEPARTMENTS THAT HAS AN ASTERISK AND THAT IS BECAUSE SOME OF THE PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES HAD FEWER THAN THREE RESPONSES SO I THINK IF THERE'S ONE TAKEAWAY, WHAT YOU WILL SEE IS WE'RE MOVING FORWARD IN ASKING FOR SOME STUFF. I WOULD JUST DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO OUR COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT IS CURRENTLY ALLOCATED FOR THAT AND SO SOME OF THE NEXT FEW SLIDES, WHAT YOU WILL SEE IS WE WOULD LIKE TO INCREASE THE NUMBER A LITTLE BIT. SO THE MAJORITY OF OUR STAFF ARE LOCATED IN OUR PATROL DIVISION AND A LOT OF YOU ARE EQUIPMENT LIKE FLEET ARE UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION SO THAT'S THOSE PERCENTAGES ARE HIGH THE WAY THEY ARE. BASED ON PRIORITIES, HERE ARE MEASURES OF SUCCESS. WE'RE HOPING TO INCREASE THE DIVERSITY WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT AND SOME PERFORMANCE MEASURES WOULD BE REPORTING AN OUTREACH METHODS USE TO EXPAND RECRUITING WITHIN HR AND I THINK WE HAVE HAD SUCCESS WHEN YOU APPROVED OUR POLICE CADET POSITIONS. UNDER THE THIRD BULLET THERE, THEY HAVE COMPETED THEIR TRAINING OR WILL BE COMPLETING THEIR TRAINING WITH US AND WILL ATTEND POLICE ACADEMY SOON AND HOPE TO REPLACE THEM. SOME OF THE IMPACTS TO THOSE OF YOU THAT WERE ASKING FOR, WHAT YOU WILL SEE, SORT OF THE THEME HERE, IS INCREASING OUR DATA-DRIVEN ABILITIES AND THEN ALSO OUR COMMUNITY FOCUS AND SO IN THE FIRST THREE BULLETS, THE REOCCURRING AMOUNTS FOR OUR ANNUAL TRAINING INCREASE. THAT IS A $60,000 ANNUAL INCREASE IN OUR CURRENT BUDGET. CURRENTLY IT'S $71,000. $20,000 COMES FROM THE STATE SO IF YOU DO THE MATH OF DEPARTMENT OF 126 SWORN POLICE OFFICERS, THAT'S A LITTLE LESS THAN $600 FOR POLICE OFFICERS INVESTING IN TRAINING. WITH THE $60,000 INCREASE, IT WOULD BRING IT AROUND $1,000 PER OFFICER -- NOT TO SAY WE WILL SPEND A THOUSAND DOLLARS PER OFFICER IF APPROVED BUT WOULD INCREASE THE AMOUNT. THE OTHER NUMBER BELOW THAT, THE ADDITIONAL TRAINING FOR POLICE OFFICERS, THAT IS TO ACCOUNT FOR THE POLICE CADET POSITIONS SO WHEN WE SEND THEM TO POLICE ACADEMY, WE'RE PAYING FOR TRAINING AND THE TUITION COST IS COMING OUT OF OUR BUDGET SO THAT $19,000 REOCCURRING IS FOR SENDING CADETS TO POLICE ACADEMY AND POLICE, STAFF, AND COMMAND TRAINING. WE TRY TO SEND OUR CURRENT SUPERVISORS TO EASTERN MICHIGAN UNIVERSITY. THE ONE-TIME COMMAND STAFF PROFESSION TRAINING WOULD BE A ONE-TIME COST WHERE WE WANT TO TRAIN SOME EXECUTIVE-LEVEL TRAINING FOR OUR LIEUTENANTS AND DEPUTY CHIEFS. SO SOME OF THE THINGS YOU WILL SEE FOR FOOT PATROLS AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT, THAT IS WHERE YOU'LL START SEEING SOME OF THE FULL-TIME, SOME OF OUR FTEs. THE DATA ARCHITECT/ANALYST POSITION IS THE FOUNDATION FOR WHAT WE HOPE TO COME BACK TO IN THE COMING YEARS, ASKING FOR ADDITIONAL FTEs. THIS WOULD GIVE US THE ABILITY TO BUILD THE FOUNDATION TO GIVE THE INFORMATION ON HOW MANY OFFICERS WE NEED AND WHAT THEY SHOULD BE DOING. THIS IS NOT TO TAKE THE PLACE OF ANYTHING BUT THIS IS -- AS WE DISCUSSED -- PROBABLY OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS THE ABILITY TO CREATE DASHBOARDS AND INTEGRATE DATA TO GIVE BETTER REPORT AND INFORM OURSELVES ON WHAT WE NEED TO BE DOING AND THAT AMOUNT, THE REOCCURRING IS FOR THAT FTE AND IT'S NOT ONLY SALARY BUT BENEFITS. WE WANT TO HOST MORE EVENTS THAN WE ARE CURRENTLY. THAT COSTS MONEY. THE PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICER POSITION IS CURRENTLY A SHARED RESPONSIBILITY SO THIS WOULD GIVE US THE ABILITY TO ENGAGE WITH THE MEDIA AS WELL AS CRAFT MESSAGES WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT AND CITY SO IF WE WERE TO ROLL OUT SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT LIKE WE DID, WE WOULD HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE COMMUNICATIONS PLAN WHERE WE COULD LOOK AT THOSE GOALS EXTERNALLY AND PERSONALLY AS A DEPARTMENT. AS THE WEATHER WARMS, WE HOPE TO PUT MORE OFFICERS, GET THEM OUT OF THE CARS ON FOOT BUT ALSO ON BICYCLES SO THAT'S WHY YOU SIGH THE $14,000 THERE -- SEE THE $14,000 THERE FOR PICKS, RACKS AND PROTECTIVE GEAR FOR THOSE OFFICERS. WE HAVE STARTED SOLICITING INTEREST FROM OFFICER IN BECOMING PART OF THE TEAM AND HAVE A HIGH LEVEL OF INTEREST SO WE WOULD LIKE TO PUT THEM ON BICYCLES IF POSSIBLE. THESE ARE SOME OF THE OTHER IMPACTS THAT WERE SEEN THIS Y YEAR. WE PURCHASED BODY CAMS FOR OUR OFFICERS. IT'S DIFFERENT THAN THE CURRENT SYSTEM FOR IN-CAR. YOU'LL SEAL A REOCCURRING AND ONE-TIME FOR THE DIFFERENCE IN COST THAT IT WOULD BE TO REPLACE THE L3 CAMERAS IN CARS. IT'S END OF LIFE FOR THOSE AND WILL HAVE TO REPLACE THEM IN THE NEXT YEAR OR TWO. THIS WOULD BE THE DIFFERENCE IN COST WITH WHAT WE HAVE SAVED IN I.T. TO REPLACE THEM. CALEA IS OUR ACCREDITED POSITION SO WE'RE ACCREDITED THROUGH LAW ENFORCEMENT --  I WROTE IT DOWN. COMMISSION ON LAW ENFORCEMENT STANDARDS. AND THIS WOULD BE -- SO CURRENTLY OUR LIEUTENANT IN CHARGE OF PROFESSIONAL STAND ARTS IS IN CHARGE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE ACCREDITATION AND GATHERING PROOF OF COMPLIANCE. SHE HAS A FULL-TIME JOB AND ARE ASKING FOR A FULL-TIME POSITION HERE, A NON-SWORN POSITION. SOMEONE COULD MANAGE THAT FOR US. SO CURRENTLY WE DON'T HAVE ANY EXPLOSIVE DETECTION K-9s SO THIS IS FOR TWO ADDITIONAL K-9 UNITS AND VEHICLES TO HOUSE THEM SO THAT IS A ONE-TIME PURCHASE FOR THE INITIAL TRAINING, THE DOGS, AND THE VEHICLES WE WOULD BE USING TO TRANSPORT THEM. AND THEN FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT HAVE COME TO THE CHIEF'S CONFERENCE ROOM, YOU WOULD KNOW THAT WE HAVE SOME LIMITATION ON OUR ABILITY TO DO WEB CONFERENCING AND SOME OTHER THINGS SO WE HAVE A ONE-TIME REQUEST FOR CONFERENCE ROOM COMMUNICATION UP GRADE.
01:20:00.625: >> HOW MANY K-9s DO WE HAVE ON THE TEAM?
01:20:03.527: >> RIGHT NOW WE HAVE TWO.
01:20:05.129: >> SO WE WOULD HAVE FOUR.
01:20:07.632: >> CORRECT. CORRECT.
01:20:10.801: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
01:20:13.471: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON: I AM JUST CURIOUS IF YOU'RE GIVE BEING A PRESENTATION PREPARED BY CHIEF COX.
01:20:19.543: >> SO WE PREPARED IT IN COLLABORATION WITH CHIEF COX. SO IT'S A COLLABORATION OF OUR LEADERSHIP TEAM SO WE ALL GAVE INPUT AND HE PARTICIPATED IN THE PREPARATION OF THIS; YES.
01:20:32.957: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON: THANK YOU.
01:20:35.960: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:20:38.863: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI: BACK TO THE K-9s. DOES THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN HAVE A K-9 AND DO YOU COLLABORATE WITH THEM?
01:20:47.538: >> CURRENTLY THEY HAVE TWO EXPLOSIVE DETECTION K-9s AND I DON'T KNOW IF THE SHERIFF DEPARTMENT HAS ONE -- THEY ARE THE ONLY TWO DOGS IN THE COUNTY SO IF THERE IS A BOMB THREAT AT SCHOOLS OR COURTS OR ANYWHERE ELSE, THEY WOULD BE THE RESOURCE WE WOULD CALL IN.
01:21:07.491: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI: AND THE CALEA MANAGER -- COULD -- ISN'T IT WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE FOR THE RECENTLY CREATED POSITION OF LIEUTENANT HELP IN THIS AREA AS WELL? I FEEL LIKE -- AS WE ADD FULL-TIME STAFF, REOCCURRING EXPENSES --
01:21:32.683: >> ABSOLUTELY. THIS IS WORK THAT HAS TO BE DONE AND WE WILL DO IT SO IF WE ARE NOT APPROVED FOR THIS POSITION, WE WOULD FIGURE OUT WHO WOULD BE BEST SUITED TO DO THAT SO WITH THE ADDITION OF THAT, POTENTIALLY A SHARED RESPONSIBILITY WITH THEM.
01:21:49.533: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI: THANK YOU.
01:21:50.935: >> COUNCILMEMBER WITH LUMM.
01:21:54.505: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM: THANK YOU. CHIEF COX IDENTIFIED FIVE FTE REQUESTS AT THE RETREAT. COUNCIL APPROVED ONE, AUDIT AND REVIEW LIEUTENANT LAST MONTH AND THE REQUEST FOR FISCAL '21, DATA ARCHITECT, PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICER, AND CALEA MANAGER. THE FIFTH POSITION IDENTIFIED AT THE RETREAT WAS A STRATEGIC PROJECT MANAGER BUT THAT IS NOT BEING REQUESTED THIS TIME. CAN I INFER THESE THREE POSITIONS BEING INCLUDED IN YOUR FISCAL YEAR 21 REQUEST THAT COUNCIL WILL NOT BE ASKED TO APPROVE A MIDYEAR FISCAL YEAR '20 AMENDMENT?
01:22:44.355: >> SO THE FIRST QUESTION -- I'M NOT SEEING --
01:22:49.293: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM: STRATEGIC PROJECT MANAGER THAT WAS REQUESTED AT THE RETREAT.
01:22:56.434: >> I THINK WE WERE TRYING TO PRIORITIZE SOME OF OUR NEEDS BASED ON PRIORITIES -- NOT TO STAY WE WON'T BRING THAT FORWARD AGAIN.
01:23:07.711: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM: IT'S NOT REQUESTED AT THIS TIME FOR '21.
01:23:11.215: >> CORRECT.
01:23:11.582: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM: AND CAN I INFER FROM THESE THREE POSITIONS -- I SEE INCLUDED IN FISCAL YEAR 21 REQUEST COUNCIL WILL NOT BE ASKED TO APPROVE A MIDYEAR FISCAL YEAR '20 AMENDMENT? I SEE ADMINISTRATOR --
01:23:29.366: >> I THINK THAT'S CORRECT.
01:23:30.901: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM: OKAY, IT IS CORRECT?
01:23:32.436: >> YES.
01:23:32.670: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM: I CAN TAKE IT TO THE BANK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [ LAUGHTER ]
01:23:37.074: >> AND THERE IS -- IT TAKES A WHILE TO RECRUIT.
01:23:41.846: >> THANK YOU.
01:23:45.382: >> WE WON'T DO ANY MORE MIDYEAR.
01:23:47.618: >> THANK YOU.
01:23:48.619: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD AND MOVE ON TO THE NEXT.
01:23:52.022: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD: ON PAGE 37 IS A STATEMENT ABOUT DEVELOPMENT, ACTIONABLE PLAN TO REDUCE CRASHES. I'M SOMEWHAT TROUBLED BECAUSE THE CITY HAS ADOPTED VISION AND SO I THOUGHT WE WERE REDUCING CRASHES.
01:24:16.247: >> AND WE ARE. THE REASON WE PLACED IT WITH PUBLIC SERVICES IS WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THE FIVE Es. ENFORCEMENT IS ONE ASPECT BUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT TEAL WITH ENGINEERING WOULD BE CARRIED FORWARD WITH PUBLIC SERVICES AND WE LOOK AT MARRYING THOSE THINGS TOGETHER SO SOME IS COLLECTING SPEED DATA TO FALL UNDERNEATH PUBLIC SERVICES AND SOME IS ENFORCEMENT AND ENCOURAGEMENT. THE POLICE DEPARTMENT WITH BACK TO SCHOOL DID A NICE JOB OF INCREASED ENCOURAGEMENT SO WITHOUT TOO MUCH DETAIL, I THINK WE KNOW WHERE THE AREAS ARE. IT COULD BE DONE WITH CHANGING INFRASTRUCTURE AND BETTER ENFORCEMENT BUT I THINK IN TERMS OF GETTING TO DATA-PAYED TYPE OF DECISIONS, WE SHOULDN'T -- WE SHOULD LOOK AND SEE WHERE THE SPEEDING OCCUR AND TRY TO KEEP TRACK FROM A PACE LINE AND AFTER THE ENFORCEMENT EDUCATION. THAT'S WHY IT'S COMBINED.
01:25:22.646: >> OKAY, I'M ASSUMING WE'RE ALREADY LOOKING AT WHERE THE CRASHES ARE OCCURRING?
01:25:26.383: >> WE ARE.
01:25:26.951: >> OKAY.
01:25:31.855: >> THANK YOU.
01:25:40.264: >> I BOUGHT A BIGGER SCREEN IN CASE I CAN'T READ THIS LIKE LAST TIME. GOOD EVENING, MAYOR AND COUNCIL. IT'S GOOD TO BE HERE. OH. THERE WE GO. WHO WE ARE -- I THINK EVERYBODY HAS SEEN THIS SLIDE ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEAR. WE ARE COMMUNITY SERVICES MADE OF PARKS AND RECREATION, COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. IT'S REALLY A CATCH-ALL FOR THE WORK WE TO AND PARTNERSHIP WITH ANN ARMOR HOUSING COMMISSION. AND ALSO THE OFFICE OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT THROUGH WASHTENAW COUNTY. SOMEONE IS HERE TO TALK ABOUT THAT. BUILDING AND RENTAL SERVICES AND PLANNING. I THINK MOST OF YOU HAVE SEEN THESE THROUGH YOUR COUNCIL HOMEWORK, PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES THAT THE COMMUNITY SERVICES AREA DOES OR AT LEAST WAS DISCUSSED THROUGH YOUR BUDGET PRIORITIES. I WON'T GO THROUGH EVERYTHING INDIVIDUALLY. I KNOW YOU'RE ALL DYING AND I KNOW THE COURT IS SUPER EXCITED TO GET UP HERE AS WELL. I'LL TOUCH ON SOME OF THE BIG ONES COMING UP THIS YEAR. IN BUILDING AND RENTAL SERVICES, THE THIRD ONE DOWN, IMPROVE CUSTOMER SERVICE SATISFACTION RATINGS, AND THE REPLACEMENT OF TRACK AND HOPE -- WE'RE NOT HOPING. WE KNOW IT HAS SOME INTEGRATED CUSTOMER SERVICE SATISFACTION SURVEY TOOLS THAT WE DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO IMPLEMENTING THOSE THIS YEAR AND UNDER PLANNING, I THINK EVERYBODY IS AWARE OF THE MASTER PLAN. I THINK THE OTHER BIG THING THAT WILL COME ABOUT AND HEAR MORE ABOUT -- AND I THINK WILL BE A RESULT OF THE CARBON NEUTRALITY PLAN THAT COMES OUT IN MARCH OR THE STRATEGY -- IS I IMAGINE THAT THE UDC, WHETHER IT'S RELATED TO PARKING OR SUSTAINABILITY ASPECTS -- IS GONNA BE LOOKED AT TO SEE WHAT IMPROVEMENTS NEED TO BE MADE TO MEET THOSE CAR UPON NEUTRALITY GOALS COMING FORWARD. SO IN A FUTURE SLIDE, YOU'LL SEE SOME MONEY PUT IN THE BUDGET THIS YEAR, PROBABLY OUR BIGGEST ADDITION FROM FISCAL 20 TO POTENTIALLY DISCUSS OR TAKE OR EVALUATE THE UDC FOR THOSE ISSUE. PARKS AND RECREATION, NOT A LOT OF CHANGE. IT'S THE SECOND YEAR OF THE BUDGET FOR US AND PRETTY MUCH MAINTAIN OUR COURSE. WE ARE ALWAYS, AS FAR AS PARKS AND RECREATION, VERY INTERESTED IN OUR USERS. WE HAVE A VARO BUST CUSTOMER SERVICE SATISFACTION SURVEY TOOL AS PART OF THE REC 1. THE DEPARTMENT CONTINUES TO MEET EXEMPLARY GOALS OF OVER 90% OR MOSTLY OVER 95% POSITIVE RESPONSES FROM OUR USERS, PAST USERS, AND PEOPLE WHO USE THE PARKS SYSTEM. COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT, I THINK, IS NO SURPRISE THE BIGGEST ISSUES DEAL WITH AFFORDABLE HOUSING. COUNCIL HAS TAKEN A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF ACTION TOWARDS EVALUATING PROGRAMS AND USE OF CITY PROPERTY. I WON'T TOUCH ON IT TOO MUCH TODAY AND WHEN JENNIFER COMES FORWARD WITH THE HOUSING COMMISSION PROJECT, YOU WILL SEE THE CONTINUATION OF THOSE AND EVALUATION OF PROPERTY AND MEETING AFFORDABLE HOUSING GOALS. THIS IS SHOW WE SPEND OUR MONEY AND SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU HAVE SEEN FROM OTHER DEPARTMENTS. OH, I'M SORRY. I'M HITTING ON MY COMPUTER AND FORGETTING TO HIT ON THAT. I APOLOGIZE. I'M SO WORRIED ABOUT MOVING THE TINY SCREEN -- ANYONE WANT ME TO GO BACK TO THE PREVIOUS SLIDE?
01:29:08.605: >> WE'RE GOOD.
01:29:09.506: >> SIMILAR TO ALL THE OTHER SLIDES YOU HAVE SEEN SO I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT. HOW WE SPEND OUR MONEY BY UNIT. I DON'T THINK THIS IS ANYTHING NEW. AND COUNCIL PRIORITIES -- IT'S ADJUSTED BY HOW WE SPEND OUR MONEY. MAKE SURE I DO THIS. MEASURES OF SUCCESS PAYED ON PRIORITIES, THE PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND SOME OF THEM ARE AMA AMALGAMATIONS. WE TALK ABOUT TIMELINESS OF THE INSPECTION OF RENTAL UNITS -- AND THAT SHOULD READ "BUILDING AND TRAILED INSPECTIONS." FOR US, WE TO TENS OF THOUSANDS OF INSPECTIONS A YEAR AND OUR CUSTOMERS' PRIORITY IS HOW FAST TO GET ON THEIR SITE, WHETHER IT'S RESIDENTIAL OR COMMERCIAL BUILDING AND ALLOW THEM TO MOVE FORWARD. IMPROVED CUSTOMER SERVICE RATING AND HOPE TO HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING THROUGH THE TOOL AND TURN IN COMPLIANCE AND HAVE A SAFE AND USABLE AREA IN THE CITY. COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. WE HAVE TOUCHED ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IT SAID HERE, INCREASE SUPPORT TO SHELTERING. THAT REALLY IS LAST YEAR FOR THE BALANCE OF BUDGET, THERE WAS A $30,000 CUT TO THE UP AMOUNT OF FUNDS TO THE OFFICE PROJECTED FOR FISCAL ' 21 IN CASE WE HAD REVENUE SHORTFALLS. WE HOPE THAT'S NOT THE CASE AND PROPOSE TO RESTORE THAT $30,000 TO THE PREVIOUS YEAR AMOUNTS, WHICH IS $165,000 A YEAR. WE PROVIDE COMMUNITY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS TO STAFF OUR HHSAB, AFFORDABLE HOUSING WORK, URBAN COUNTY WORK, AND COORDINATING FUNDING. THAT WILL PUT FUNDING TO PREVIOUS LEVELS. PARKS AND RECREATION. MAINTAIN CUSTOMER SERVICE PLANNING, THINGS WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE, PERFORMANCE MEASURES. I THINK WE HAVE TOUCHED ON THESE ALREADY. IMPACTS TO ACHIEVE COUNCIL PRIORITIES. BUILDING A RENTAL. WE HAVE REALLY NO IMPACTS -- THE ONLY FTE WE ADDED WAS A SPLIT WITH OSI OFFICE OF SUSTAINABILITY AND INNOVATION. WE CAME TO YOU EARLY IN FISCAL '20 TO DO THAT SO THAT'S BEEN APPROVERRED BY COUNCIL -- APPROVED BY COUNT SIMILAR. WE HAVE NO ADDITIONAL FTE ASKS ABOVE THAT, NO REAL IMPACT STATEMENTS. OTHER THAN A FEW ADJUSTMENTS TO SALARY THAT IS OF BENEFIT. YOU SEE THE RESTORE FISCAL '21 LEVEL FOR OFFICE OF COMMUNITY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. THAT'S WHERE THAT IS AT RIGHT NOW. PARKS AND RECREATION. WE TO HAVE A FEW MINOR IMPACT STATEMENTS THAT YOU WILL SEE BUT NOTHING THAT HAD TO DO WITH SATISFACTION RATINGS. THAT'S WHY THAT IS ZERO HERE. AS I DISCUSSED EARLIER UNDER PLANNING, ADDRESS THE PARKING AND SUSTAINABILITY ASPECT OF THE UDC. WE SEE WHEN THE CARBON NEUTRALITY STRATEGY COMES OUT THE UDC WILL GET A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF ATTENTION OVER THE NEXT YEAR OR TWO AND AS A PLACE HOLDER WE PROPOSE AN ADDITIONAL $100,000 FOR POTENTIAL PROFESSIONAL SERVICES TO ASSIST WITH THOSE CHANGES TO THE UDC. IT OPPORTUNITY MEAN THEY'RE AN ABSOLUTE BUT -- IT DOESN'T MEAN THEY'RE AN ABSOLUTE BUT ANTICIPATE PASS WE HAVE DONE OVER THE LAST YEAR OR TWO WE HAVE SEEN A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF REQUESTS BOTH FROM STAFF AND COUNCIL TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO EXISTS UDC DANCES SO THAT'S WHY -- ORDNANCE SO THAT'S WHY IT'S IN THERE. MONEY TO MASTER PLAN, CONTRACT PENDING. IT'S SOMETHING ALREADY CONSIDERED EVEN THOUGH IT WAS CALLED OUT BEFORE. AND LASTLY, OTHER IMPACTS FOR THE SAME REASON AS THE REDUCTION, TO OFFICE AND COMMUNITY ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. LAST YEAR THERE WAS A $50,000 CUT PROPOSED FOR FISCAL 21 FOR THE TIER MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. I FORGOT TO CHANGE AGAIN. I APOLOGIZE. SO THIS IS THE CHANGES OR IMPACT SHEETS OR IMPACTS NOT ON THE PREVIOUS PRIORITIES. THE TIER MANAGEMENT PROGRAM -- UNTIL WHAT REVENUE IN FISCAL 21, THERE WAS A PROPOSED PUT OF $50,000 IN THE TWO-YEAR BUDGET. WE'RE ASKING THAT BE RESTORED TO PREVIOUS LEVELS. IT WAS NOT AN INCREASE BUT WOULD BE THE SAME AT $150,000. WE DID DO AND PARKS AND RECREATION DID A SALARY STUDY ON HR WITH TEMP AND SEASONAL EMPLOYEES AND DETERMINED THIS IS AN ADJUSTMENT NEEDED FOR OUR TEMP AND SEASONAL EMPLOYEES THAT DOES HAVE A $28,000 IMPACT ON THE BUDGET. THAT'S IN THE HR STUDY JUSTIFIES THAT BASED ON OTHER -- IT'S BECOMING TOUGHER AND TOUGHER WHEN WE RAMP UP SEASONAL EMPLOYEES AND PARKS IN REC. WE'RE TALKING 200 TO 300 ADDITIONAL EMPLOYEES SO ALTHOUGH IT'S $28,000, IT'S RELATIVELY MINOR IN COMPARISON AND GOES TO SPECIFIC POSITIONS THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO HOW WE RUN OUR FACILITY. SIMILARLY, THE FIRST AID AND CPR CERTIFICATION FOR REIMBURSEMENT TO LIFE GUARD IS SOMETHING PREVIOUSLY WE DIDN'T COVER THE COST OF FOR OUR LIFEGUARDS. IT'S BECOMING INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO ATTRACT QUALITY LIFE GUARDS TO OUR POOLS AND THE SYSTEM. SO THAT IS SOMETHING WE FEEL LIKE IS AN APPROPRIATE COST FOR US TO COVER FOR POTENTIALLY QUALIFIED LIFEGUARDS COMING IN WHO NEED THAT CERTIFICATION. SO.
01:35:15.405: >> SO YOU'RE GOING TO REIMBURSE THE LIFE GUARDS BUT YOU ALSO REQUIRE FIRST AID AND CPR FOR A LOT OF YOUR, LIKE, DAY CAMP ASSISTANT POSITIONS. SO -- THOSE WOULD NOT -- THOSE PEOPLE WOULD NOT BE REIMBURSED BUT WOULD BE REQUIRED TO HAVE THAT CERTIFICATION?
01:35:33.356: >> YEAH. RIGHT NOW WE'RE ONLY PROPOSING THE LIFE GUARD POSITIONS BECAUSE OF THE DIFFICULTY RECRUITING THEM. COLIN IS HERE IF WE NEED CLARIFICATION. THAT'S NOT SOMETHING WE'RE PROPOSING RIGHT NOW OR SOMETHING WE ALREADY COVER.
01:35:53.476: >> WE'RE PROPOSING TO COVER THE COST FOR THE LIFE GUARD STAFF AND FOR FIRST AID/CPR FOR ALL THE SEASONAL STAFF THAT WE HAVE. SO WE ACTUALLY REQUIRE ALL OUR STAFF POSITION TO HAVE FIRST AID/CPR. IT'S JUST A KEY FOR US ACROSS ALL THE FACILITIES FOR SAFETY.
01:36:14.698: >> THANK YOU.
01:36:15.432: >> OKAY, THANK YOU.
01:36:17.234: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
01:36:24.040: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER: THANKS. I'M CURIOUS ABOUT THAT. WHEN YOU'RE DOING THAT PROGRAM, IT IS LIKE A DIRECT REIMBURSEMENT TO RED CROSS? WHY NOT JUST HIRE THEM TO RUN A CLASS OR SOMETHING?
01:36:33.416: >> SO WE ACTUALLY DO HAVE STAFF THAT ACTUALLY TEACH THE CLASSES.
01:36:37.954: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER: OKAY.
01:36:38.755: >> BUT THERE'S STILL A COST TO TURN IN THE PAPERWORK TO GET THE CERTIFICATION THROUGH THE RED CROSS.
01:36:45.195: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER: OH, OKAY.
01:36:46.029: >> WE ACTUALLY HAVE A NUMBER OF OUR FULL-TIME STAFF ACTUALLY TEACH THE CLASSES.
01:36:50.233: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER: I WONDER IF THE PUBLIC WOULD BE INTERESTED IN THAT.
01:36:54.537: >> WE ALSO OFFER THE LIFE GUARD CLASSES THROUGH OUR OWN STAFF AT TIMES AND THERE ARE CERTAINLY A NUMBER OF PUBLIC THAT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT.
01:37:04.981: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER: FORMER WSI GUY HERE. IT'S WORTH IT FOR PEOPLE TO KNOW HOW TO SWIM.
01:37:10.520: >> COUNCILMEMBER.
01:37:13.156: >> I JUST HAD A QUICK QUESTION ABOUT DID WE HURRY IN HERE -- POSSIBLE INSPECTION OR THINGS HAVING TO DO WITH THE SHORT-TERM REN DAMS? -- RENTALS. [ LAUGHTER ]
01:37:27.070: >> NO.
01:37:28.138: >> I DIDN'T SEE IT IN THERE.
01:37:29.806: >> NO.
01:37:30.707: >> THEY WILL DO IT IN-HOUSE, RIGHT?
01:37:33.009: >> SOMEHOW THAT --
01:37:34.544: >> YES. CURRENTLY THE INTENTION IS ANY ADJUSTMENT OR ADDITIONAL STAFF TIME NECESSARY TO DO INSPECTION OF SHORT-TERM RENTALS WILL BE ABSORBED BY EXISTING STAFF. WE DO -- WE HAVE 30,000 REN DAM UNITS. S -- RENTAL UNITS. THE  INCREASE TO THE WORK LOAD IS RATHER INSIGNIFICANT FROM AN INSPECTION STANDPOINT. IS THE PROCESS OF POTENTIAL ENFORCE TESTIMONY, WE NEED TO DO MORE EVALUATION OF BUT SAME AS RENTAL UNITS. COMPARED TO ENFORCEMENT ON LONG-TERM RENTALS ALREADY, IT'S RELATIVELY MINOR, AND WE BELIEVE IT WOULD MOST LIKELY BE COVERED BY ANY FEE FOR THOSE REGISTRATIONS SO WE'RE NOT PROPOSING ANY BUDGET IMPACT TO THAT CURRENTLY. NEXT YEAR, FISCAL 22, IF WE'RE WRONG, COULD BE BACK TALKING ABOUT THAT BUT DON'T SEE AN INCREASE IN COST AT TIME.
01:38:30.000: >> WE HAVE LUMM, EATON, HAYNER, AND PERHAPS WE CAN CALL IT THAT DAY BECAUSE WE'RE ON THE CLOCK.
01:38:35.572: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM: SPEAK BEING OF FEES, I DIDN'T SEE BUDGET IMPACT REVENUE. I DON'T KNOW IF INCREASES APPEAR ON THOSE PAGES OR NOT. IN ANY CASE, ARE WE PLANNING PARKS AND REC FEE INCREASE FOR '21?
01:38:53.723: >> NONE.
01:38:53.957: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM: OKAY.
01:38:54.557: >> NONE IN BILLING AND RENTAL AND NONE IN PARKS EITHER.
01:38:59.429: >> NOT IN BUILDING ALSO?
01:39:04.034: >> COULD YOU ADD SOME MORE SLIDE FOR THIS? I DOWNLOADED THE AND, I DON'T KNOW -- LIKE 47 IS THE FIFTH DISTRICT COURT AND -- 15TH DISTRICT COURT. I DOWNLOADED A FEW DAYS AGO. OKAY.
01:39:19.015: >> I THINK FIRE DEPARTMENT PICTURES.
01:39:23.053: >> OH, OKAY.
01:39:25.588: >> THAT MESSED ME UP, TOO.
01:39:27.490: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
01:39:30.360: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON: SO BECAUSE THERE'S NO MENTION OF SHORT-TERM RENTALS IN THIS MATERIAL, WE EXPECT WE WILL HAVE ACCOMPLISHED THE GOAL BY THE END OF THIS FISCAL YEAR?
01:39:40.603: >> WE'LL HAVE A PROPOSED ORDINANCE IN FRONT OF COUNCIL BEFORE THE FISCAL YEAR IS UP FOR SURE.
01:39:46.843: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON: RELATED TO THAT YOU NOTE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO ADJUST THE SEASONAL AND TEMPORARY WAGES. WILL THAT BRING THEM UP TO WHAT OUR LIVING WAGE ORDINANCE REQUIRES OF OUR CONTRACTOR?
01:39:58.321: >> NO, IT'S NOT FULLY UP TO LIVING WAGE; NO.
01:40:02.358: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON: OKAY, THANK YOU.
01:40:03.660: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
01:40:06.529: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER: SO I HAVE TO ASK, DEREK. IT WAS THE DEER CALL EXPENSES WERE GOING DOWN TO $100 AND NOW THEY'RE UP TO $150. IT'S INDEED NOT OVER AND WILL CONTINUE THE CALLING?
01:40:18.541: >> THAT'S COMPLETELY UP TO CITY COUNCIL, AND I IMAGINE WE WILL HAVE THAT DISCUSSION MOVING FORWARD. RIGHT NOW WE'RE PUTTING THE MONEY IN THE BUDGET IN CASE COUNCIL DOES DECIDE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE PROGRAM.
01:40:28.384: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER: SO IF WE DID -- SO WE HADED FOUR-YEAR PLAN AND THEN A FIVE-YEAR PLAN AND SO WOULD WE REBID THE CONTRACTOR ON THAT? WAS THIS STARTING OVER AGAIN OR SOME KIND OF MAINTENANCE? I'M CURIOUS WHAT MADE YOU THINK IT WOULD GO UP AGAIN INSTEAD OF --
01:40:44.067: >> AGAIN, THE CUT WAS MORE BASED ON A REVENUE EXERCISE WHEN WE DO A TWO-YEAR BUDGET. TO BRING INTO BALANCE FOR '21 -- AFTER DOING THE PROGRAM THIS YEAR WITH THE EXPECTATION OF WHAT WE DID THIS YEAR, JUST REPEATING NEXT YEAR, IF THAT IS COUNCIL'S DESIRE, WE SPENT PRETTY CLOSE TO THAT WHOLE 150 SO IF THE PROGRAM IS GOING TO GO FORWARD AND WILL BE CONSISTENT WITH ACTIVITIES LAST YEAR -- WHICH WE FEEL IF WE'RE GOING TO DO IT SUCCESSFULLY IS THE AMOUNT OF DATA ACTIVITIES AND RESEARCH THAT GOES WITH IT. WE RECOMMEND A RECURRING COST OF $150,000. WHETHER COUNCIL WANTS TO GO FORWARD WITH THAT, WE CERTAINLY HAD A RESOLUTION FOR FOUR YEARS AND CAME FOR A ONE-YEAR EXTENSION BASED ON THE RESEARCH PERMIT FROM THE DNR. SOME TYPE OF STAFF WILL WANT ACTION FROM COUNCIL AUTHORIZING US TO CONTINUE ACTION. AND TWO, YOUR QUESTION WAS TO REBID THE CONTRACT -- WE HAVE NOT REVISITED THAT. TO TATE WE HAVEN'T FOUND -- TO DATE WE HAVEN'T FOUND A VENDOR THAT PERFORMS UNDER TO OUR SATISFACTION. BECAUSE OF THE VALUE OF THE CONTRACT, THAT IS SOMETHING WE WOULD REBID AND MAY PUT IT OUT THERE AGAIN JUST TO VALIDATE OUR THOUGHTS BUT HAVEN'T DECIDED YET.
01:42:05.848: >> THANK YOU.
01:42:06.549: >> PROBABLY DON'T WANT ME TO SPEAK TO DEER MANAGEMENT, BUT JUST QUICKLY, THANK YOU FOR INCORPORATING THIS AND I INDICATED IT AS A PRIORITY ON MY HOMEWORK. I JUST ENCOURAGE MY COLLEAGUES WHO HAVEN'T READ THE ESSAY AND REPORTS, THE DATA ON THE THE IMPACTS AND HOW IT CORRELATES TO DEER MANAGEMENT, I THINK, IS VERY -- YOU KNOW, IT'S SIGNIFICANT AND IT'S SUBSTANTIVE AND PROFESSOR -- DOCTOR -- CHRISTOPHER DICK CAME AND SPOKE TO US AND HE INDICATED THAT IN THE ABSENCE OF THIS PROGRAM, WE WOULD HAVE SOMETHING LIKE 6,000 MORE DEER TODAY. THE IMPACTS ON OUR NATURAL AREAS ARE SIMPLY NOT SUSTAINABLE. AND SO MY PITCH. BUT THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE SEEING THIS HERE.
01:43:12.115: >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
01:43:14.083: >> THANK YOU, SIR.
01:43:15.385: >> AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST.
01:43:27.697: >> GOOD EVENING, COUNCIL AND MAYOR TAYLOR.
01:43:33.670: >> MAYOR TAYLOR: THANK YOU.
01:43:34.837: >> I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE COURT TO PROVIDE A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE CAN SAFELY COME AND -- SORRY. I WILL START OVER. I'M A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS. THE COURT PROVIDES A COMMUNITY WITH AN IMPARTIAL, SAFE, AND ACCESSIBLE FORUM FOR THE RESOLUTION OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE DISPUTES. OUR UNITS ARE LIST WILLED UP THERE. WE DO HAVE A NUMBER OF SPECIAL PROGRAMS THAT WE PERFORM. SOBRIETY COURT FOR SECOND-OFFENSE, A COURT FOR THOSE IN ARMED FORCES, MENTAL HEALTH COURT, DEDICATED DOCIMASTIC VIOLENCE, STRAIGHT OUTREACH OR HOMELESS COURT FOR PEOPLE HOMELESS OR NEARING HOMELESS. AND A CASE EVALUATION PROGRAM. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CASE EVALUATION, THE PROGRAMS ARE TO HELP THOSE WHO ARE INDEED OF TREATMENT AND/OR OTHER ANCILLARY SERVICES SUCH AS HOUSING OR EDUCATION OR JOB SKILLS. AND YOU CAN SEE A BREAKDOWN BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS. COURT-APPOINTED ATTORNEY IS A NEW ONE. RIGHT NOW WE ARE DEALING WITH -- YOU WILL SEE THIS ON THE HORIZON ISSUE -- THE MICHIGAN INDIGENT DEFENSE COMMISSION IS NEW TO US. WE'RE NOT SURE HOW THAT WILL WORK OUT, ALTHOUGH WE KNOW HOW THE PROCESS IS CURRENTLY RUN WILL CHANGE IN THE NEAR FUTURE. THE FIRST SET OF STANDARDS IS OUT THERE BUT PART OF THE SECOND SET THEY'RE LOOKING TO IMPLEMENT WOULD TAKE THE COURT OUT OF THE EQUATION AND SO THAT IS SORT OF A PLACEHOLDER AT THIS POINT. FOR MEASURES OF SUCCESS, SHARING WITH YOU OUR PUBLIC SATISFACTION SURVEY RESULTS AND IN THE RESULTS COLUMN WILL SEE THE "AGREE" OR "STRONGLY AGREE" NUMBERS. THOSE ARE THE 2019 SURVEY RESULTS. THE ONLY ONE THERE YOU MAY RISE AN EYEBROW TO IS QUESTION FIVE, "THE OUTCOME OF THE CASE WAS FAVORABLE TO ME." THAT WOULD BE -- I WOULD SAY, IF THAT WERE HIGHER, THAT WOULD IMPLY THAT PEOPLE WERE NOT RESPONDING TO PEOPLE WHO HAD NOT PREVAILED -- MEANING WE WANT PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE EQUATION RESPONDING TO SOUR SURVEY. AS FAR AS IMPACTS, WE HAVE HAD A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN CIVIL FILE BEINGS, KNOWN AS PROVIDER OR COVENANT CASES, CASES IN WHICH MEDICAL PROVIDERS ARE SUING INSURANCE COMPANIES FOR PAYMENTS OF SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE INSURED. THEY CENTER AROUND AUTO ACCIDENTS AND TREATMENT NEEDED AFTERWARDS. YOU CAN SEE THE CIVIL FILING HISTORY FOR NEW FILINGS IS AT THE BOTTOM AND OVER TIME, WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO COVER THE INCREASES WITH EXISTING STAFF AND EXISTING TIMES THAT BUDGETED OR BY OFFSETS LIKES LEAVE OF ABSENCES OR VACANCIES BUT THAT IS BECOMING TOUGHER AND TOUGHER AS THE LEVEL OF FILINGS INCREASE. SO YOU SEE THAT PERSONNEL TIME IS MAINLY WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR FUNDING FOR AND THEN IN ADDITION TO THAT, A THIRD IMPACT, WHICH IS AN INCREASE IN THE HOURLY RATE OF THE OFFICERS WHO DO THE WEAPONS SCREENING. HORIZON ISSUES -- AS MENTIONED, THERE IS THE MICHIGAN INDIGENT DEFENSE STANDRDS THAT ARE THE FIRST ARE IN PLACE WITH MORE COMING. WE KNOW THAT. WE HAVE TRIAL COURT FUNDING AS AN ISSUE. THERE WAS A COMMITTEE SET UP BY THE LEGISLATURE THAT LOOKED AT HOW TRIAL COURTS ARE FUNDED AND MADE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR WAYS TO CHANGE IT. WHILE THEY HAVE MADE THEIR FIVE RECOMMENDATIONS, THERE'S NOT A SET PLAN AT THIS POINT AS TO HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET THERE. BUT PART OF WHAT IT LOOKS AT IS HOW THERE MIGHT BE MORE OF A BALANCE BETWEEN THE STATE AND THE LOCAL LEVEL OF FUNDING IN COURTS. AND THEN THE LAST ONE THERE IS E-FILING. THE STATE CURRENT ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE IS MOVING COURTS TOWARDS THIS. THEY ARE PROVIDING THE SYSTEM. THEY'RE PROVIDING A DOCUMENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM THAT WORKS WITH IT, BUT RIGHT NOW WE ARE IN WHAT -- THEY'RE CALLING THEM WAVES AS THEY'RE MOVING THE COURTS ON BOARD WITH THIS. WE ARE NOT SCHEDULED TO GO WAVE SIX. RIGHT NOW THEY'RE ON ONE SO THIS IS DEFINITELY IN THE FUTURE. ALL RIGHT.
01:48:28.297: >> ANY QUESTIONS?
01:48:32.735: >> AGAIN, THE TRIAL COURT FUNDING -- YOU SAID THE STATE IS LOOKING AT CHANGING HOW THE MODEL OR THE FORMULA?
01:48:40.977: >> THEY'RE LOOKING AT -- THEY PUT TOGETHER A COMMITTEE OF DIFFERENT STAKE HOLDERS TO LOOK AT HOW THEY'RE CURRENTLY FUNDED AND THEN TO LOOK AT OTHER STATES WHERE THERE ARE DIFFERENT MODELS SO THEY COULD MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW WE MIGHT GO FORWARD IN PROVIDE MORE STABLE FUNDING --
01:48:57.593: >> THE STATES.
01:48:59.962: >> IT WOULD STILL BE A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE STATE AND LOCAL FUNDING UNITS.
01:49:05.401: >> AND WHEN DO YOU THINK THAT WILL BE -- WILL THAT -- WILL ANY RECOMMENDATIONS CHANGES BE -- I DON'T KNOW, REQUIRED TO BE AFFECTED THIS YEAR? OR FISCAL YEAR '21?
01:49:21.150: >> I DON'T THINK SO. THEY NEED TO START WITH LEGISLATIVE CHANGES, BUT LONG TERM, I THINK THIS IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE AT LEAST A TEN-YEAR PROJECT.
01:49:30.559: >> OH, OKAY.
01:49:31.027: >> AND THE OTHER STATES THEY WERE USING AS A BEST PRACTICES MODEL FOR DIFFERENT REASONS, ONE OF THEM WAS TEN YEARS AND THE OTHER WAS 13 YEARS AS FAR AS A TIMELINE.
01:49:42.371: >> SO THIS IS A HORIZON ISSUE. OKAY, THANK YOU.
01:49:44.974: >> THANK YOU.
01:49:51.347: >> SO IN SUMMARY, ANY FY 21 QUESTIONS YOU HAVE, PLEASE SEND THEM TO MS. HIGGINS WITH COPIES TO MR. CRAWFORD AND ME AND MS. BUSELMEIRE.ER. THEY WILL BE ORGANIZED BY TOPIC AND WILL BE ORGANIZED THROUGHOUT THE BUDGET SEASON. WE HAVE QUESTIONS THAT STEM FROM DECEMBER. THOSE HAVE NOT BEEN LOST OR FORGOTTEN AND WILL START TO RESPOND TO THOSE NOW THAT WE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED THE PACELINE FROM WHERE WE HAVE STARTED.
01:50:21.277: >> THANKS A LOT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
01:50:22.445: >> YOU'RE WELCOME. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.
01:50:25.448: >> MAYOR TAYLOR: IT REFLECTS QUITE A LOT FROM A LOT OF PEOPLE. THANK YOU.
01:50:33.989: >> CITY ADMIN. LAZARUS: I APPRECIATE FEEDBACK PASS WE MOVE TOWARDS PRIORITY-BASED BUDGETING AND DECISION-MAKING. THOSE THINGS THAT ARE HELPFUL FOR YOU TO BE ENGAGED, PLEASE LET ME KNOW OF THOSE THING THAT WE DIDN'T DO THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. I MEAN, WE'LL CONTINUE TO ADAPT AND CHANGE THE PROCESS TO MEET YOUR NEEDS AS YOU LOOK AT THE BUDGET.
01:50:54.110: >> MAYOR TAYLOR: THANK YOU. WE NOW COME TO PUBLIC COMMENT GENERAL TIME. PUBLIC COMMENT GENERAL TIME IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO SPEAK TO COUNCIL AND COMMUNITY ABOUT ISSUES. YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES TO SPEAK SO PLEASE PAY ATTENTION TO THE CLOCK. WE MAY ONLY HAVE ONE PERSON SPEAKING AT A TIME AND IF YOU REQUIRE ASSISTANCE IN SPEAKING BEFORE COUNCIL, WE WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO PROVIDE IT TO YOU. WOULD ANYONE LIKE TO SPEAK IN PUBLIC COMMENT? PLEASE.
01:51:33.682: >> I WASN'T ABLE TO COME TO THE WORK SESSION. I CAME AT THE END OF THE WORK SESSION YOU HAD IN DECEMBER. BUT THIS IS -- I WILL BRING UP A CONCERN I'VE HAD. ONE OF THE CONVINCE ABOUT ANN ARBOR IS IT'S FAKE LEFT, RUN RIGHT. IN THE WHOLE PRESENTATION, IT DOESN'T SAY WHAT THE TOTAL GENERAL FUND BUDGET IS. IT HAS ALL THE PERCENTAGES. AND I KIND OF TRIED TO DO SOME, YOU KNOW, QUICK BACK OF THE HAND --  I THINK IT'S $88 MILLION. BUT THAT'S THE WHOLE GENERAL FUND BUDGET. MAYBE IT'S MORE THAN THAT. I DON'T KNOW. RIGHT? SOME PEOPLE WHO HAVE SEEN ME DO THE RED RIBBON CHART TO PROVIDE SOME PERSPECTIVE SO THE TOTAL AMOUNT THAT WAS PROVIDED TO THE HUMAN SERVICE PROVIDERS WAS LIKE $1.2 MILLION. AND WHEN I DID THE K-MART I HAD ONE FOOT, RIGHT, FOR THE ONE MILLION DOLLARS AND THE WHOLE GENERAL FUND IS 80 FEET LONG. BECAUSE WE GET TUCK IN THESE POWERPOINT PRESENTATIONS AND, AND IT CONSTRICTS OUR ABILITY TO THINK ABOUT THOSE PERSPECTIVES BECAUSE WHEN YOU ALLOCATE THE MONEY AND THE ANN ARBOR NEWS REPORTS "CITY OF ANN ARBOR HAS DOLLED OUT ALL THIS MONEY TO THE HUMAN SERVICE AGENCIES." AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT HOW MUCH MONEY THAT IS AND THE BREAK DOWN. THERE IS A MILLION DOLLARS AND IS NOT AS MUCH AS PEOPLE THINK. I RAISE MONEY IN THE RELIGIOUS COMMUNITY FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND OTHER THINGS BEEN AND IS NOT ENOUGH MONEY. IT'S CREATING DYSFUNCTION IN THAT SYSTEM. AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS -- THE COORDINATED FUNDING MODEL CREATED A LITTLE MORE EFFICIENCY SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO TO ALL THE VERY DIFFERENT PUBLIC BODIES TO DO THAT BUT WE HAVE DEVELOPMENT DIRECTORS IN OUR NON-PROFITS AND ARE FRYING TO HAVE FUNDRAISERS TO MAKING THIS WORK. THE CHALLENGE IS IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR IS EASIER TO BUDGET $100,000 THAN RAISE $100,000 HAT SOME EVENT. THE COMMUNITY FOUNDATION, THE WHOLE BUDGET IS $4.3 MILLION INCLUDING THE CITY, COUNTY, FEDERAL MONEY AND UNITED WADE AND COMMUNITY FOUNDATION AND ST. JOE'S PUTS IN $250,000. THAT IS ALL THAT IS ALL THAT IS THERE. AND IT'S CREATING DYSFUNCTION AND CRISIS. IT'S NOT ENTIRELY CITY COUNCIL'S FAULT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH MONEY. THERE'S STRUCTURAL REASONS WHY THERE'S NOT ENOUGH MONEY BUT I THINK WE NEED TO GET AROUND THAT AND START PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE BECAUSE EVENTUALLY WILL COME BACK HERE WHEN REAL CRISISES HAPPEN. [ BEEPING ] THANK YOU.
01:54:48.544: >> THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT?
01:55:02.391: >> KEN GARBER. I WILL TALK MORE ABOUT THE CARBON BUDGET THAN THE CITY BUDGET. I ARGUE THEY'RE EQUALLY IMPORTANT. YOUR FIRST SLIDE SHOWED STUDENT VOLUNTEERS ON THE FIRE STATION SIX ROOF AFTER THE SOLAR PANEL INSTALLATION LAST NOVEMBER. WE PUT IN 52-KILOWATTS OF SOLAR POWER THAT SAVES 56 METRIC TONS FROM CO2 ADDING TO PROBABLY HEATING. I WILL GET BACK TO THOSE 56-TONS IN A MINUTE. FIRST, ABOUT FINE. IT'S A SINGLE WORST THING YOU CAN TO. THERE'S A REASON WHY SCIENTISTS REFUSE TO FLY. CO2 EMISSIONS FROM JET BOWL ARE 0.3-KILOGRAM FOR COACH PASSENGERS BUT REALLY A LOT WORSE THAN THAT. FINAL OXIDES CONVERT TO ZONE. OZONE ZONE IN THE STRAOSPHERE BLOCKS UV BUT IN THE DROP SPHERE, WHERE JETS FLY, IT'S A HAZARDOUS GASP THERE ARE CONCENTRATION TRAILS THAT ALLOW INCOMING SOLAR RADIATION AND AMPLIFY THE GREEN HOUSE EFFECT. BURNING JET FUEL HAS 0.8 KILN GRAMS EQUIVALENT PER PASSENGER MILE SO A PERSON FLYING FROM DETROIT TO GERMANY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR 6.73 METRIC TON CO2 EQUIVALENT, MORE GREENHOUSE GAS THAN THE AVERAGE AMERICAN HAS IN DRIVING AND IF NINE PEOPLE SAY COUNCIL MEMBERS AND STAFF AMERICAS MAKE THE GERMANY TRIP, THAT WOULD WIPE OUT A FULL YEAR'S GREEN HOUSE REDUCTION FROM THE FIRE STATION SIX SOLAR INSTALLATION. THOSE WERE THE 56-TONS EQUIVALENT WE THOUGHT WE PREVENTED BUT NOW YOU HAVE PUT THEM INTO THE ATMOSPHERE. YOU CAN BUY OFFSETS BUT IS NO SOLUTION. THEY ALMOST NEVER TAKE INTO EFFECT THE NON-CO2 EFFECTS OF AIR TRAVEL AND THERE ARE OTHER REASON WHY THEY DON'T WORK AND EVERY FLIGHT ADDS DEMAND AND ENCOURAGES INVESTMENT AND EXPANDED RUNWAYS, TERMINALS, AIRCRAFT, INVESTMENT THAT SHOULD GO INTO RENEWABLES. THEY DO NOT TAKE THE DEMAND INTO EFFECT. WE'RE LOCKING IN AN INDUSTRY THAT IS HARD CARBON. I'M NOT CLAIMING MORAL SUPERIORITY AND FLY A LOT DURING MY LIFE DESPITE THE HARM I INFLICTED ON THE PLANET. I STOPPED FLYING FOUR YEAR AGO AND SPEAK OUT OF A SENSE OF SHAME AND BELATED RESPONSIBILITY TO OUR YOUNG PEOPLE. I'M NOT ASKING YOU NOT TO FLY. I THOUGHT YOU SHOULD KNOW THE FACTS. THANK YOU.
01:57:56.632: >> THANK YOU. WOULD ANYONE ELSE LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT?
01:58:04.606: >> HELLO THERE. MY NAME IS ZOLTAN YOUNG ON PARTON DRIVE. WE'RE BEING AFFECTED BY THE PARTON DRIVE CONSTRUCTION AND ARE EXCITED ABOUT THAT WITH THE
