MOVED BY COMMISSIONER SAUVE, SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL. ANY DISCUSSION ON THE MINUTES BEFORE US THIS EVENING? COMMISSIONER MILLS?
00:01:28.751: >> Vice Chair Mills: I ALWAYS SEARCH FOR MY NAME TO MAKE SURE THAT WHAT I SAY SOUNDS QUASI INTELLIGENT. THIS IS LESS INTELLIGENT THAN NORMAL. I THINK THERE'S VERBS MISSING ON MAY 21st, PAGE 14, THE SECOND FULL SENTENCE IF IT SAYS MILLS ENCOURAGED PULAY TO QUANTIFY THE NUMBER OF BROWN LOT SURFACE PARKING SPACES BEING LOST SHOWING HOW THIS ADDITION, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.
00:01:53.175: >> Chair Milshteyn: ALL RIGHT. WE WILL MAKE THAT CHANGE.
00:01:56.578: >> Vice Chair Mills: THANK YOU.
00:01:57.646: >> Chair Milshteyn: ANY OTHER CHANGES TO THE MINUTES? ALL RIGHT. ALL THOSE IN FAVOR, PLEASE SAY AYE. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? THEY ARE APPROVED. MOVING ON TO REPORTS FROM CITY ADMINISTRATION, CITY COUNCIL, PLANNING MANAGER, PLANNING MISSION OFFICERS AND COMMITTEES. WE FIRST HAVE A REPORT FROM OUR CITY COUNCIL REPRESENTATIVE, COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN.
00:02:17.066: >> Councilmember Ackerman: CITY COUNCIL MET LAST NIGHT. A FEW UPDATES OF NOTE. THE CITY AND STATE HAVE REACHED AN AGREEMENT WITH THE ALLEN CREEK RAILROAD BERM OPENING. THIS IS AN EXCITING PROJECT THAT WOULD OPEN DEPOT STREET TO BANDERMER PARK CONNECTING THE PEDESTRIAN WALKWAY ON DEPOT TO THE BORDER TO BORDER TRAIL BUT IT WILL SERVE AS A STORMWATER OUTLET TO THE RIVER AS WELL. SO A WIN/WIN FOR THE CITY AND EXCITING THAT IT'S MOVING FORWARD. 325 EAST SUMMIT, ALSO KNOWN AS THE GARNET, WHICH THIS BODY PASSED ON TO CITY COUNCIL WITH RECOMMENDATION FOR APPROVAL MOVED ON FROM FIRST READING TO SECOND READING. ALTHOUGH THERE WERE SOME COMMENTS OF OPPOSITION WITH RESPECT TO THE ZONING TYPE THAT IS BEING USED. 2705 NEWPORT ROAD WAS ZONED FROM TOWNSHIP TO R1, ONE OF THE R1s, I THINK R1A, AND A NUMBER OF UDC AMENDMENTS THAT WERE CORRECTIONS THAT WERE INCORRECTLY TRANSITIONED FROM CHAPTER 55 INTO THE UDC WERE MOVED FORWARD LAST NIGHT AS WELL. AND THEN FINALLY, THREE SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS FOR SIDEWALKS ON PONTIAC TRAIL, ON SCIO CHURCH AND ON DHU VARREN ALL WENT FORWARD AND WE WILL GET SOME NEW SIDEWALK GAPS FILLED THROUGHOUT THE CITY.
00:03:42.518: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU. MR. LENART, DO YOU HAVE A REPORT FOR US?
00:03:45.854: >> Planning Manager:  NO REPORT THIS EVENING.
00:03:49.224: >> Chair Milshteyn: PLANNING COMMISSION OFFICERS AND COMMITTEES? WRITTEN COMMUNICATIONS AND PETITIONS? WE HAVE RECEIVED QUITE A BIT OF WRITTEN COMMUNICATIONS. SO PLEASE TAKE A LOOK AT. THAT AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION. THIS IS THE TIME FOR MEMBERS OF THE AUDIENCE TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION IN REGARDS TO ITEMS NOT ON OUR AGENDA THIS EVENING. IF YOU ARE HERE TO AN ISSUE NOT ON OUR AGENDA, THIS IS A TIME TO SPEAK TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION. YOU HAVE UP TO THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION. ANYONE? SEEING NO ONE, WE WILL MOVE ON TO PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULED FOR THE NEXT BUSINESS MEETING.
00:04:20.689: >> Planning Manager:  NO NEW PUBLIC HEARINGS ARE SCHEDULED FOR THE NEXT BUSINESS MEETING. WE EXPECT A COUPLE OF RETURNING ITEMS. THE -- WE ANTICIPATE THE RETURN OF THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING PREMIUMS, AND POTENTIALLY THE SIGN ORDINANCE. BOTH OF THOSE HAVE ALREADY HAD PREVIOUS PUBLIC HEARINGS.
00:04:40.876: >> Chair Milshteyn: ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU. UNFINISHED BUSINESS? THE FIRST ITEM UNDER UNFINISHED BUSINESS IS 2857 PACKARD ROAD PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT SITE PLAN FOR CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL. THE PETITIONER WILL HAVE UP TO TEN MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE COMMISSION, FOLLOWED BY A STAFF REPORT, AND THEN WE'LL HAVE A PUBLIC HEARING AND THEN WE'LL GO INTO DISCUSSION AND VOTE.
00:05:10.672: >> GOOD EVENING, COMMISSION. MY NAME IS TOM COVERT, I'M WITH MIDWESTERN CONSULTING. I'M HERE WITH JIM HEISLER, THE DEVELOPER AND A COUPLE OF MEMBERS OF THE DESIGN TEAM, INCLUDING OUR TRANSPORTATION MANAGER AND OUR PROJECT ENGINEER, TYLER SMITH. AS YOU WILL RECALL FROM PREVIOUS MEETINGS, I'M JUST GOING TO DO A QUICK CONTEXTUAL OVERVIEW OF WHERE WE ARE LOCATED -- WHERE THE PROJECT IS LOCATED. IT'S A SHORT DISTANCE AWAY FROM PLAT AND WE ARE ON THE NORTH SIDE OF PACKARD ROAD. A BIT EAST OF BURR PARK. YOU WILL SEE THERE TO THE LEFT OF THE IMAGE, AND WE'RE SURROUNDED BY THE GREENLY KENNINGTON FARMS NEIGHBORHOODS. YOU WILL RECALL FROM OUR LAST MEETING THAT THE PROJECT IS A PROPOSED PUD WITH 51 UNITS, DETACHED SINGLE FAMILY HOMES AROUND THE PERIMETER AND HOME UNITS IN THE CENTER BLOCK. WE MAINTAIN THE CONDITIONS OF R1E ZONING CLASSIFICATION. WE PRESERVE ADDITIONAL NATURAL FEATURES BY PROPOSING THIS PUD VERSUS THE PREVIOUSLY DENIED SITE PLAN. WE HAVE A UTILITY LAYOUT THAT REMAINS THE SAME FOR THE PROJECT. WE HAVE A STORMWATER SOLUTION THAT'S STILL OVER TREATS, I WILL SAY, BUT IT COLLECTS STORMWATER THAT HISTORICALLY BYPASSED THE SITE AND PONDED ON NEIGHBOR'S HOMES. THE HOME STYLINGS WILL REMAIN THE SAME. SINCE THE LAST MEETING, WE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH THE NATURAL AREA PRESERVATION FOLKS, REVIEW OUR MAINTENANCE PLAN AND A BIT FURTHER DETAIL AND PROVIDE SOME EDITS TO THAT FOR SOME CLARITY AND DEFINITION TO THAT MAINTENANCE PLAN. SO THOSE REVISIONS ARE BEFORE YOU. WE ALSO COMPLETED SOME PLANTING PLAN REVISIONS WHICH WILL ALLOW THE -- OR THE GOAL WILL REDUCE THE DEER BROWS ON SOME OF THE PLANTS THAT ARE PROPOSED THERE. THE PROPOSED HOME CHARACTER IS WHAT YOU SEE HERE. THERE WILL BE SOME SINGLE STORY RANCHES AND SOME TWO-STORY HOMES. FROM THE LAST MEETING, WE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE COMPARISON CHART -- THE CURRENT PLAN, THE PUD BEFORE YOU PRESERVES 13 LANDMARK INDUSTRIES. THE AREA PLAN THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY APPROVED PRESERVED 14 LANDMARK TREES. FOR COMPARISON THE DENIED SITE PLAN HAD PRESERVED SEVEN LANDMARK TREES. THE CURRENT PUD PLAN THAT'S BEFORE YOU PRESERVES .89 ACRES OF WOODLANDS. THE AREA PLAN WAS .79 ACRES OF WOODLANDS AND THE DENIED SITE PLAN WAS .3 ACRES OF WOODLANDS. THIS CURRENT PUD PLAN PRESERVES 584 INCHES OF WOODLANDS. THE AREA PLAN WAS AT 376 INCHES, AND THE DENIED SITE PLAN WAS AT 266 INCHES. SO WITH THIS, WHAT YOU BEGIN TO SEE IS THAT THE PUD WAS VERY -- OR IS VERY CONSISTENT WITH WHAT THE AREA PLAN HAD CALLED FOR WITH PRESERVATION AND THE NATURAL FEATURES. WE SEE THE BENEFITS BEING A DISVERSE HOUSING TYPOLOGY FOR THE NASH HOUSING MARKET. IT PUTS ATTACHED UNITS AND MIXES THOSE WITH SINGLE FAMILY DETACHED HOMES. WE ARE PROVIDING NATURAL FEATURES PRESERVATION AND A MAINTENANCE PLAN TO HELP PROTECT THOSE NATURAL FEATURES WITH THE DEVELOPMENT. WE HAVE A STORMWATER MANAGEMENT PLAN THAT EXCEEDS STORMWATER MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS. WE'RE ADDRESSING THE HISTORICAL FLOODING CONCERNS IN THE AREA, AND THE PUD, WHAT THAT ALLOWS US TO DO IS ACHIEVE THE ATTACHING OF THE UNITS IN THE CENTER BLOCK OF THE PLAN, FOR ADDITIONAL NATURAL FEATURES PRESERVATION. OUR GOAL FOR THIS EVENING IS TO RESPECTFULLY REQUEST ACTION ON THE PROJECT. THE DEVELOPER WILL NOT MAKE ANY FURTHER CHANGES TO THE M PLANS R OFFERING FURTHER REVISIONS. WE DO OR I SHOULD SAY WE HAVE RECEIVED COUNTY WATER RESOURCE COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE APPROVAL OF THE PLANS, AND WE HAVE -- WE HAVE RECEIVED STAFF RECOMMENDATIONS FOR APPROVAL AS WELL. AND WE REVISED THE PLANS AS WE NOTED FOR THE LAST PLANNING COMMISSION MEETING. THANK YOU.
00:09:38.874: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU. WE WILL HEAD OVER TO MR. CHANG FOR THE STAFF REPORT.
00:09:42.978: >> I BELIEVE THE PETITIONER COVERED ALL THE ITEMS. WE INCLUDED SOME ITEMS INCLUDING THE FLOOR AREAS AND BASEMENTS. IF YOU HAVE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS REGARDING THE NATURE FEATURES MAINTENANCE PLAN, I'M SURE THE PETITIONER COULD ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS AS WELL.
00:09:59.094: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU. WE ARE MOVING ON TO A PUBLIC HEARING. AT THIS TIME, ANYONE WISHING TO SPEAK IN REGARDS TO THIS PROJECT? THIS IS YOUR TIME TO SPEAK. YOU WILL HAVE UP HAD TO THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION. PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS FOR THE RECORD.
00:10:13.508: >> SURE. CAN YOU HEAR ME OKAY WITH THIS MIC AS IT IS. MY NAME IS DAN BILICH. I LIVE AT 2719 CRANBROOK ROAD. IT'S KIND OF UNCOMFORTABLE TORE HERE BECAUSE I ALWAYS LIKE TO SPEAK WELL OF PEOPLE AND I NEED TO BE CRITICAL OF THIS, BUT ANYHOW. PLEASE GIVE ME, MY IGNORANCE ABOUT THE ZONING BUSINESS AND ABOUT THE DEVELOPING BUSINESS. I'M JUST A CITIZEN TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. SO MR. PROPERTY OWNER HAS A LOT WITH BIG, BEAUTIFUL TREES ON IT, AND BY THE WAY, A LITTLE BEAUTIFUL HISTORICALLY IMPORTANT HOUSE TOO. MR. BUILDER SAYS TO THE CITY, THOSE SURE ARE NICE TREES THAT THE PROPERTY OWNER HAS ON THAT LOT. I WANT YOU TO CHANGE YOUR ZONING RULES TO FACILITATE ME MAKING A BUNCH OF MONEY BY BUILDING ON THAT LOT. AND BY THE WAY, IT WOULD SURE BE ASHAME IF SOMETHING BAD HAPPENED TO MANY P MR. PROPERTY OWNER'S INDUSTRIES. I WILL GET YOU MY PRETTIES AND THE LITTLE HOUSE TOO! LAST TIME I CAME TO ONE OF THESE MEETINGS, A FELLOW CITIZEN ACCUSED THE BUILDER/DEVELOPER OF BLACKMAIL. A DICTIONARY TELLS ME THAT PLBLACKMAIL IS WHEN SOMEONE DEMANDS MONEY EXCUSE ME OR ANOTHER BENEFIT FROM SOMEONE AND IN RETURN FOR NOT REVEALING COMPROMISING INFORMATION ABOUT THEM, THIS IS NOT BLACKMAIL. I THINK THE WORD THAT MY FELLOW CITIZEN WAS LOOKING FOR WAS EXTORTION. THE SAME DICTIONARY IS EXTORTION, OBTAINING SOMETHING BEING ESPECIALLY MONEY, THROUGH FORCE OR THREATS. NOW, I DON'T WANT TO ACCUSE MR. BUILDER OF EXTORTION BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE TO SPEAK ILL OF PEOPLE. AND I HAVE NO EXPERTISE IN THE LAW HERE. SO I WILL MAKE NO SUCH ACCUSATION. HOWEVER, I DO KNOW THAT AS A CITIZEN OF ANN ARBOR AND OF MY NEIGHBORHOOD, IT SURE FEELS LIKE EXTORTION. IT SURE DOES. SO I MAKE NO ACCUSATION, BUT I WILL ASK YOU MEMBERS OF THE PLANNING COMMISSION, AND THE CITY'S LEGAL STAFF, IF THIS ISN'T EXTORTION, CAN YOU PLEASE EXPLAIN THE DISTINCTION TO US CITIZENS AND TELL US WHAT ACTUALLY IS GOING ON HERE? AND IF IT IS EXTORTION, WHAT IS THE PROPER LEGAL JURISDICTION FOR THE CITY TO FILE A CRIMINAL COMPLAINT? THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
00:12:52.033: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU.
00:13:02.711: >> HI, COUNCIL, GOOD EVENING. MY NAME IS SUE SYMINGTON, 264 CARMEL. I SENT YOU THE ATTACHMENT WITH THE PHOTO FROM BURR PARK AND THIS WAS IN MARCH, WHERE THERE WAS A SANITARY SEWER OVERFLOW. AT THE ENTRANCE OF BURR PARK AND EASY STREET. THIS HAS BEEN A CONCERN OF MINE FROM THE GET-GO REGARDING THIS MAR PROJECT. AND I FEEL IN THIS CITY, WE PAY FOR CONSULTANTS AND SURVEYS ALL THE TIME, AND I'M THE ONE WHO I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST MORATORIUM ON BUILDING IN THIS PARTICULAR AREA BECAUSE OF RECENT EVENTS WITH THE PPOS, WITH OUR SEWAGE OVERFLOWS. OUR AREA HAS BEEN PRONE TO THIS IN THE DECADES I HAVE LIVED IN THAT PARTICULAR AREA. I FEEL STRONGLY THAT WE SHOULD HIRE A CONSULTANT TO DEAL WITH THE CITY-WIDE SEWER PROBLEMS OR REVIEW THEM SO WE CAN MAKE DECISIONS THAT WON'T AFFECT PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY LIVING THERE IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE THAT'S GOING TO BE A COSTLY ENDEAVOR IF ANYTHING ELSE HAPPENS IN OUR CITY. I'M NOT SURE WHERE WE ARE HEADED WITH, AS FAR AS THE CITY GOES. I WILL PAY ATTENTION ON THE SEWAGE OVERFLOWS BUT THAT'S BEEN MY CONCERN WITH THIS PROJECT AND I ENCOURAGE PEOPLE AT THE LAST MEETING TO WALK THE PROPERTY, TO LOOK AT THE GRATING OF THE PROPERTY. I'M NOT SURE IF THAT'S GOING TO BE TAKEN CARE OF. MY NEIGHBOR IS GOING TO HAVE THAT RETENTION POND IN HIS BACKYARD AND WE ARE JUST -- I'M JUST FEARFUL FOR THAT. I APPRECIATE YOU LISTENING TO ME AND THANK YOU.
00:14:49.784: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU.
00:14:52.320: >> HI. I'M BACK. SO KAREN WHITE, AND I LIVE AT 2719 CRANBROOK, ADJACENT TO THIS BEAUTIFUL SITE. OKAY. SO WHAT I WANT TO SAY. I HAVE BEEN COMING TO THESE MEETINGS FOR A WHILE NOW BECAUSE I WANT TO DO THE RIGHT THING BY THIS SITE, AND I NEEDED TO EDUCATE MYSELF AND FIND OUT HOW A CITIZEN IS SUPPOSED TO BE INVOLVED. AND I HAVE SEEN A COUPLE OF REALLY HORRIBLE THINGS AND A COUPLE OF GOOD PROPOSALS. AND MOST RECENTLY, VERIDIAN PROPOSAL, WHICH IS ADJACENT TO OUR NEIGHBORHOOD, IS MUCH MORE ENVIRONMENTALLIENCE SENSITIVE, OR THE ROXBURY GROUP, WHERE THEY KNOW HOW TO COMMUNICATE WITH COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND TAKE THEIR FEELINGS INTO ACCOUNT. THAT HASN'T BEEN HAPPENING HERE. I WOULD URGE YOU TO PUT THIS ON HOLD. I KNOW THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE DEVELOPMENT ON THIS SITE. I KNOW IT. BUT WE DON'T HAVE THE LUXURY OF ANY MORE BAD DEVELOPMENT, AND THIS IS BAD DEVELOPMENT. I HAVE BEEN TALKING TO MY NEIGHBORS ABOUT THIS QUITE A BIT. I UNDERSTAND THAT STAFF HAS RECOMMENDED APPROVAL, AND I THINK I UNDERSTAND THE REASONING. I'M LATE TO THIS PARTY AND THE LAWS ARE IN PLACE. I WOULD SAY THAT THE STAFF THINKS HALF A LOAF IS BETTER THAN NONE. AND I -- I HAVE TO USE A DIFFERENT METAPHOR. I THINK THE BETTER METAPHOR IS THAT WE ALL SHARE A SINGLE HOME. MAYBE A MULTIUNIT BUILDING, I DON'T KNOW. BUT WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER. AND THE HOUSE IS ON FIRE. IT'S ON FIRE AND WE MAY NOT LIVE THROUGH IT. AND THE DEVELOPER WOULD LIKE TO BUILD A SMALL FIRE IN A PART OF THE BUILDING THAT'S NOT YET A FLAME SO HE CAN ROAST SMORES, GET HIS PROFIT. HE DIDN'T BELIEVE IN GLOBAL WARMING ANYWAY. AND WHAT COULD A 300-YEAR-OLD TREE DO TO MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF GLOBAL WARMING? WE'RE JUST ANN ARBOR. I THINK WE DESERVE ENOUGH TIME TO REALLY WORK THIS PLAN OVER AND MAKE IT BETTER. WE ALL KNOW IT COULD BE A LOT BETTER, AND I THINK WE SHOULD DEMAND THAT, AND THAT'S HOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS PLANNING COMMISSIONERS AND AS CITIZENS. THANK YOU. HAD.
00:17:55.303: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU.
00:18:01.976: >> GOOD EVENING, MY NAME IS CHRIS CROGET. I'M PART OF THE MICHIGAN PRESERVATION NETWORK AND I'M SECRETARY OF ANN ARBOR HISTORICAL FOUNDATION. I'M -- TONIGHT, I HAVE BEEN ASKED BY ELLEN THACKERY, WHO IS THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR THE MICHIGAN HISTORIC PRESERVATION NETWORK TO READ A LETTER TO YOU. BEFORE I DO THAT, I WOULD LIKE TO JUST SAY THAT THIS PROJECT IS A PUD, AND ONE OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF A PUD IS THAT THERE BE A PUBLIC BENEFIT IN EXCHANGE FOR THE SUSPENSION OF THE ZONING RULES FOR THAT PARTICULAR PARCEL. SINCE BEFORE THE DEATH OF LOUISA PIPER, WHO WAS WELL KNOWN FOR ALL OF HER WORK IN ANN ARBOR ON BEHALF OF HISTORIC PRESERVATION, A NUMBER OF US HAVE BEEN MEETING ABOUT THE PRESEVENNATION OF THE GREEK REVIVAL FARMHOUSE ON THE PROPERTY. I WENT TO A MEETING AT TAPPAN WHERE I ASKED THE OWNER OF THE PROPERTY AND THE DEVELOPER IF THEY COULD MOVE THAT FARMHOUSE TO THE COBBLESTONE FARM PROPERTY. THEY HAVE SHOWN AN INTEREST AS PART OF THE PUBLIC BENEFIT, AND I DON'T THINK THAT THIS IS TOO MUCH TO ASK. SO I'M HERE TONIGHT ADVOCATING FOR THAT. BUT THIS IS ELLEN THACKERRY'S LETTER. SHE TRIED TO SEND IT TO YOU, BUT IT WAS TOO LATE. DEAR PLANNING COMMISSIONERS, MY NAME IS ELLEN THACKERRY AND I LIVE AT 1510 MARTHA IN ANN ARBOR AND I SERVE AS THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR AT THE STATEWIDE HISTORIC PRESERVATION NONPROFIT THE MICHIGAN HISTORIC PRESERVATION NETWORK. I'M A MEMBER OF THAT ALSO. I AM WRITING YOU TO REGARDING THE PROPOSED PLANNED DEVELOPMENT AT 2857 PACKARD. I WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT IF THIS PROJECT WILL BE RECOMMENDED TO CITY COUNCIL FOR APPROVAL, THAT A CONDITION OF THE APPROVAL BE THAT THE EXISTING CIRCA 1850 FARMHOUSE BE LEFT ON THE SITE FOR THREE TO SIX MONTHS, SO THAT THE HOUSE CAN BE VIEWED AND STRUCTURALLY ASSESSED FOR A POTENTIAL MOVE. THE CURRENT OWNER HAS INDICATED THAT POTENTIAL BUYERS CAN ASSESS THE HOUSE IN LATE JULY, AND A GROUP OF INTERESTED RESIDENTS HAVE BEEN MEETING TO DISCUSS THE POSSIBILITY OF MOVING THE HOUSE. I WOULD HATE TO SEE THE HOUSE DEMOLISHED BEFORE REASONABLE ALTERNATIVES COULD BE EXPLORED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU.
00:20:29.957: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION WITH REGARDS TO THIS PETITION? SEEING NO ONE, I WILL CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING AND I WILL READ THE TWO MOTIONS THAT WE HAVE BEFORE US. MOTION NUMBER ONE, THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION HEREBY RECOMMENDS THAT THE MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL APPROVE THE WEBER FROM R1E SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENTIAL TO CONDITION -- WITH CONDITIONS TO PUD PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT AND SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS. MOTION NUMBER TWO, STATES THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION HEREBY RECOMMENDS THAT THE MAYOR AND THE CITY COUNCIL APPROVE THE WEBER PUD SITE PLAN AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT. DO I HAVE A COMMISSIONER THAT WILL MOVE BOTH OF THESE. MOVED BY COMMISSIONER SAUVE AND SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER BRIGGS. WE ARE IN DISCUSSION. COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN.
00:21:23.845: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR. WE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING THIS OFF AND ON SINCE 2016. IN THAT TIME, VARIOUS PLANS HAVE COME BEFORE THIS BODY AND ON TO CITY COUNCIL. THE COURTS HAVE BEEN INVOLVED, AND IT HAS BEEN A SAGA. IN THAT TIME, A LOT OF QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN ASKED AND ANSWERED. A LOT OF QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN ASKED AND NOT ANSWERED. AND A FEW OF THOSE ITEMS THAT WE ASKED FOR WEEKS AGO WERE LEFT UNANSWERED. IT IS REASSURING TO SEE THAT THERE IS A NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PLAN IN PLACE. IT LOOKS TO BE A FIVE-YEAR PLAN THAT'S BEEN REVIEWED AND DEVELOPED WITH OUR STAFF, EXPERTS IN THE FIELD AND THAT'S REASSURING TO ME. BUT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OPEN QUESTIONS LEFT. I DID, I GUESS, THREE -- THREE AREAS COME TO MIND, AS WE DISCUSS THIS AGAIN. I FIRST WANT TO TURN TO STORMWATER. THIS SPRING AND SUMMER, YOU KNOW, I THINK HAS BEEN EYE-OPENING FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE OF WHAT ARE THE REALITIES OF A CHANGING CLIMATE IN TERMS OF OUR DAY-TO-DAY LIVES. AND THE INCREASE IN RAIN WATER IS WHAT THE MIDWEST SEES AND FEELS MOST IMMEDIATELY, AND WE HAVE BEEN NO EXCEPTION. AND I WAS JUST WONDERING, I UNDERSTAND THE PLANS AND THE ENGINEERING TO HELP CAPTURE STORMWATER THAT WOULD OTHERWISE RUN OFF INTO NEIGHBORS' PROPERTIES BUT IS THERE -- THROUGH THE COUNTY OR LOCAL FOLKS, IS THERE A MEASURE OF THE AMOUNT OF WATER THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE BYPASSED THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE CAUGHT ON SITE. SO WHAT IS THAT MEASURE? AND THEN, WHAT IS OUR ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM TO ENSURE THAT THOSE STANDARDS ARE BEING MET? I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S A STAFF QUESTION OR --
00:23:19.961: >> Planning Manager:  I DON'T HAVE THE SPECIFIC CALCULATION. I THINK MY UNDERSTANDING IS PART OF THE WATER RESOURCE COMMISSIONER REVIEW, THEY DO CALCULATE ESTIMATED KNOWS OF SITE -- FLOWS OF THE SITE, BASED ON THE TOPOGRAPHY OF THE SITE, WHAT PORTIONS OF THE GRADE ARE DRAINING ON TO THAT. I THINK THEY DO LOOK AT PROJECTED VOLUMES TO DETERMINE IF THEY ARE GOING TO BE RETAINED ON SITE. IS IT DESIGNED TO ACCOMMODATE THAT? OR UNDER THE CODE, IF THEY ARE JUST BYPASSING THE SITE THROUGH A SWALE THAT HAS TO BE DESIGNED TO ACCOMMODATE THE PROPOSAL, BUT I DON'T KNOW IN THE PROJECT ENGINEER HAS MORE DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THAT CALCULATION IS FOR THE SPECIFIC SITE.
00:24:01.802: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU MR. COVERT. , MR. COVERT.
00:24:11.412: >> WE ARE MEETING THE OFFICE STANDARD, INCLUDING STORMWATER INFILTRATION. SO WE ARE NOT ONLY TREATING THE QUALITY, BUT THE QUANTITY OF FLOW AT THE SITE. YOU WILL RECALL WHEN YOU FIRST SAW THIS PLAN BACK IN, I BELIEVE 2016, WITH THE AREA PLAN, WAS ABOUT THE SAME TIME THEY WERE CHANGING THEIR STANDARDS AND PART OF THAT CHANGE IN STANDARDS, INCLUDED CALCULATIONS WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR SOME OF THE INCREASES IN RAINFALL THAT THE COUNTY HAD BEEN OBSERVING THROUGH DATA ON RAINFALL FOR THE AREA. SO WE ARE TREATING THE 100-YEAR STORM EVENT AT OUR SITE -- WELL, LET ME BACK UP. WE ARE TREATING ALL STORM EVENTS BUT THE MAXIMUM STORM EVENT IS THE 100 YEAR STORM EVENT. SO WE ARE TREATING THE SMALLER STORM EVENTS WITH GREATER FREQUENCY. WE ARE TREATING THOSE BY TREATING THE QUALITY MAINLY. WE ARE PROVIDING FOR QUALITY TREATMENT WITHIN OUR BASINS WITH THE PROPOSED NATURAL VEGETATIVE AREAS AND THE INFILTRATION THAT WILL HAPPEN AT THE SITE. WE ARE FORTUNATE OUR SITE HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO INFILTRATE AT RATES GREATER THAN WHAT WOULD BE ALLOWED BY THE CALCULATIONS, HOWEVER, TO HAVE SOME LEVEL OF PROTECTION THAT IF SOMETHING WERE TO HAPPEN LIKE THEY GOT SILTED UP OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, WE DO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THESE BASINS TO OUTLET TO UNDERGROUND PIPES THAT CONNECT TO THE PACKARD ROAD SYSTEM. SO THERE IS A PROTECTION IN THE FACT THAT THE CALCULATIONS HAVE BEEN UPDATED AND THERE'S A PROTECTION IN THAT THEY DON'T ALLOW US TO TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN INFILTRATE ON THE SITE AND FROM THE MAINTENANCE PROTECTION STANDPOINT, THE SITE WILL HAVE A DRAINAGE DISTRICT SET UP THROUGH THE COUNTY, WHICH WILL BE A SEPARATE SET OF DOCUMENTS THAT WILL ALSO BE INCLUDED IN THE MASTER DEED AND BYLAWS AND EXHIBIT B DRAWINGS, WHICH -- GO AHEAD.
00:26:14.435: >> Councilmember Ackerman: SO I APPRECIATE THAT AND THAT GIVES ME REASSURANCE THAT THE PROPERPROPERTIES ON THE SITE WOT FLOOD. TO BE MORE TRANSPARENT, WHAT IS THE PUBLIC BENEFIT THAT A PUD ALLOWS OR, I GUESS, PROVIDES. AND THE BIGGEST ONE THAT I CAN PUT MY THUMB ON IS THE STORMWATER, RIGHT? THAT UNDER THESE PLANS HOPEFULLY NEIGHBORS' FLOODING IS REDUCED, RIGHT? AND THAT'S -- THAT'S THE ONE I CAN EVEN START TO PUT MY THUMB ON AND SO IF YOU COULD HELP ME UNDERSTAND THE DEGREE TO WHICH THAT STORMWATER WILL BE REDUCED FROM NEIGHBORING PROPERTIES.
00:26:54.875: >> YEP.
00:26:55.142: >> AN ZACK AND THEN WHAT THE ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM WOULD BE FOR US TO HOLD.
00:27:01.148: >> SO ESSENTIALLY WHAT HAPPENS AT OUR SITE, THE SURROUNDING NEIGHBORHOODS WERE DEVELOPED AT A TIME WHEN THE STORMWATER RULES WERE DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THEY ARE TODAY. SO WITH REGARD TO THE RULES, WE HAVE TO COLLECT AND DETAIN FOR THE STORMWATER THAT BASICALLY A DROP OF WATER ON OUR SITE HAS TO GO THROUGH OUR STORMWATER SYSTEM BEFORE IT LEAVES. THE EXISTING CONDITIONS AT THE SITE HAVE AN AREA ABOUT THAT FLOW FROM OFFSITE, FROM THE SUBDIVISIONS -- I'M LOOKING AT SHEET 14. IF YOU LOOK AT THOSE GRAY AREAS, 1.62 ACRES, .29 ACRES, .39 ACRES, WITH THE CURRENT RULES AND STANDARDS, THAT'S -- THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE STORMWATER OF THE SITE. THAT IS STORMWATER THAT WE COULD BUILD A SWALE OR A PIPE SYSTEM AND BYPASS OUR SITE. WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE ARE TAKING THOSE AREAS, IF YOU LOOK AT SHEET 14, THE PROPOSED SITE DRAINAGE PLAN, THOSE AREAS THAT ARE ON THE TOP OF THE PAGE SHADED IN GRAY. THOSE AREAS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PAGE, WHICH ARE CROSS-HATCHED, WE'RE TAKING THOSE AREAS AND WE'RE COLLECTING THEM ON OUR SITE, AND INSTEAD OF BYPASSING THE SITE, WE ARE PUTTING IT THROUGH OUR STORMWATER SYSTEM.
00:28:25.432: >> Councilmember Ackerman: LET US CATCH UP WITH YOU.
00:28:27.601: >> SURE.
00:28:43.584: >> Councilmember Ackerman: SO IF I'M READING -- THIS IS THE BOTTOM FIGURE ON 14, THE BOTTOM LEFT.
00:28:48.789: >> YES.
00:28:49.056: >> Councilmember Ackerman: AND THEN IT'S THE HOUSES OFF CARAMEL AND CRANBROOK AND THEN THE ARROW POINTS IN THE DIRECTION OF YOUR BASIN IS THAT -- SO IS THAT DEMONSTRATING THAT EVEN IN 100-YEAR STORM EVENT, THE WATER ON THOSE PROPERTIES MOVES TOWARDS THAT BASIN, IS CAPTURED AND TREATED?
00:29:09.543: >> YEP. SO LET ME BACK UP. SO THOSE POLYGONS THAT ARE OUTLINED BY THE THICK LINE WITH THE SMALL DOT IN IT, THOSE ARE DRAINAGE AREAS. SO THE DRAINAGE AREAS OF SITE, AS EXISTING ARE ON THE TOP OF THE PAGE GRAPHIC AND AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PAGE, THEY ARE THE PROPOSED GRAPHIC. SO WHAT HAPPENS IS, WE ARE COLLECTING THE AREA IN THE GRAY ON THE TOP GRAPHIC. SORRY. IN THE GRAY ON THE TOP GRAPHIC, THAT STORMWATER FLOWS THROUGH OUR SITE. ON THE BOTTOM GRAPHIC, THAT SAME AREA, WITH THE CROSS-HATCHING, WE ARE COLLECTING THAT ON SITE. WE ARE SHOWING THAT THE DRAINAGE AREAS -- THE DRAINAGE AREAS, THE THICK LINE WITH THE DOTS, ALL CORRESPOND WITH ONE OF OUR STORMWATER ELEMENTS. FOR EXAMPLE, ALONG CARAMEL STREET, YOU SEE THE CROSS-HATCH WITH THE ARROW GOING TO THE POND AT THE NORTHEAST CORNER THAT DRAINAGE AREA IS NOW GOING TO THAT DETENTION POND INSTEAD OF BYPASSING OR FLOWING ACROSS OUR SITE INTO THE NEIGHBOR'S BACKYARD.
00:30:12.840: >> Councilmember Ackerman: OKAY. SO IT'S MORE ABOUT THE WATER COMING DOWNGRADE FROM EASY THROUGH THE SITE THAN IT IS --
00:30:19.513: >> FROM EASY AND CARAMEL, CORRECT. ZA>> Councilmember Ackerman: OKAY.
00:30:29.623: >> CONVENTIONAL DESIGN WOULD HAVE THE EASY STREET AND THE CARAMEL LOTS WOULD SIMILAR TO WHAT WE ARE PROPOSING BY HAVING PIPES OR DITCHES IN THEIR BACKYARD TO TAKE THAT WATER FROM THOSE YARDS AND THEN GO TO THEIR DETENTION BASIN.
00:30:42.136: >> Councilmember Ackerman: OKAY.
00:30:43.604: >> SINCE THEY DON'T HAVE DETENTION BASINS, WE -- BY CURRENT STANDARDS, WE CAN BYPASS THAT FLOW AND LET IT BACK OUT IN THE NEIGHBOR'S YARD, WHICH WOULDN'T BE A GOOD SOLUTION,  OBVIOUSLY. THEY ARE EXPERIENCING FLOODING NOW.
00:31:00.521: >> Councilmember Ackerman: OKAY. THANK YOU.
00:31:01.789: >> MM-HMM.
00:31:06.060: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  I WANT TO MOVE NOW -- THANK YOU, MR. COVERT. IN THE STAFF REPORT, THERE WAS REFERENCE TO AN APPLICATION TO MOVE THE 1840s FARMHOUSE. I WAS WONDERING, WHAT -- I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO EDUCATE MYSELF A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE HOUSE AND THE PROCESS TO MOVE AN HISTORIC HOME. WHAT IS THAT APPLICATION AND THE PROCESS BY WHICH IT BEGINS? WHO IS THE APPLICANT? WHAT PARTY IS THE APPLICANT? WHERE IS THAT APPLICATION?
00:31:42.996: >> Planning Manager:  SO REGARDLESS OF THE HISTORIC SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STRUCTURE, IT IS NOT IN A PROTECTED AND LOCAL HISTORIC DISTRICT. SO THAT MEANS THAT THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL CITY REGULATIONS THAT WOULD PROHIBIT MOVING IT OR ALTERATIONS TO THAT STRUCTURE. THAT SAID, ANYBODY COULD APPLY TO MOVE THE STRUCTURE TO ANY LOCATION. THAT WOULD OBVIOUSLY -- IT'S BEEN DONE BEFORE IN THE CITY, AND IT IS -- IT CAN HAPPEN, STRUCTURES CAN BE MOVED. IT CAN BE A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT, OBVIOUSLY, LOGISTICAL CHALLENGE TO PHYSICALLY ACCOMMODATE THAT THROUGH EVERYTHING FROM THE RIGHT-OF-WAY TO UTILITY LINES AND THE LIKE. NONETHELESS, ANY PROPERTY OWNER COULD INITIATE THAT AS A BUILDING PERMIT AND A CORRESPONDING PERMITS THAT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO TRAVERSE THE PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY TO DO SO. I THINK IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS DISCUSSION, BOTH REFERENCING THE STAFF REPORT AND MORE GENERALLY, THERE' DISCUSSION ABOUT PLACING THE STRUCTURE ON A CITY-OWNED FACILITY, SPECIFICALLY REFERENCED TO COBBLESTONE FARM. TO BE CLEAR, THE CITY HAS NOT RECEIVED ANY SORT OF FORMAL PROPOSAL SAYING WE WOULD LIKE TO MOVE THE STRUCTURE TO COBBLESTONE FARM AND LOCATE IT AT THIS SPECIFIC LOCATION FOR THE FOLLOWING PURPOSES. GENERALLY SPEAKING, FROM A STAFF PERSPECTIVE, THAT WOULD -- MIGHT BE CHALLENGING TO MOVE IT ON TO THE COBBLESTONE FARM HOMESTEAD, BECAUSE THAT IS A CITY REGULATED PROPERTY THAT -- OF HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE THAT WE CURRENTLY CONTROL. IT MIGHT BE CHALLENGING TO ADD A STRUCTURE TO THAT, THAT WOULD COMPROMISE THE INTEGRITY OF THAT DISTRICT, HOWEVER, COBBLESTONE FARM IS SURROUNDED BY A LARGE EXPANSIVE CITY PARKLAND THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE UTILIZED. SIMILARLY, THOUGH, NO FORMAL PRESENTATION HAS BEEN MADE TO THE CITY, PARTICULARLY TO THE PARKS ADVISORY COMMITTEE AND ULTIMATELY THE CITY COUNCIL WOULD WOULD HAVE TO MAKE A DETERMINATION TO SAY, YES, WE WANT THAT STRUCTURE ON THAT SITE. WE HAVE AN IDENTIFIED PLAN AS TO HOW THAT'S GOING TO BE FINANCIALLY ACCOMMODATED, HOW IT WILL BE MAINTAINED, AND ANY LONG-TERM MAINTENANCE OR PROGRAMMING ASSOCIATED WITH THAT.
00:33:47.921: >> Councilmember Ackerman: SO IF THIS -- IF ANY HOUSE AND IT'S ACTUALLY SOUNDS LIKE IT -- THERE MAY BE MORE OPPORTUNITY CONSIDERING IT'S NOT HISTORICALLY PROTECTED, ALTHOUGH THERE ARE ISSUES WITH THAT. IF IT WAS GOING FROM CURRENTLY PRIVATE PROPERTY TO A DIFFERENT PRIVATE PROPERTY, IT WOULD BE DEALT WITH WITH A APPLICATION PROCESS.
00:34:10.210: >> Planning Manager:  YES, LARGELY BUILDING PERMITS AND RIGHT-OF-WAY PERMITS.
00:34:14.948: >> Councilmember Ackerman: WHERE THE CITY WOULD GET INVOLVED IS IF THE SECOND LOCATION IS CITY OWNED?
00:34:20.420: >> Planning Manager: CORRECT.
00:34:21.588: >> Councilmember Ackerman: OKAY. WITH RESPECT TO THE SANITARY SEWER, I JUST WANT TO GIVE A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND AND THEN I DO HAVE A QUESTION. BUT WE HEAR YOU. THE SANITARY SEWERS ARE LEAKING AND THEY ARE GETTING INTO THE RIVER. AND THAT'S NOT HOW IT'S SUPPOSED TO WORK. THAT IS NOT HOW -- HOW LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS SUPPOSED TO TAKE CARE OF ITS NATURAL ASSETS AND ITS PHYSICAL ASSETS, THE PIPES THEMSELVES. THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF WORK IN THE LAST TWO DECADES TO FIX THAT PROBLEM. THE BIGGEST AND MOST EXPENSIVE WAS $140 MILLION INVESTED INTO THE SANITARY SEWER PLANT, THE PROCESSING PLANT. WHICH IS BRAND NEW, STATE-OF-THE-ART. THE ISSUE THAT NOW REMAINS IS HOW DO YOU GET SEWAGE FROM PEOPLE'S PRIVATE PROPERTY, PUBLIC PROPERTY, TO THAT STATE-OF-THE-ART PLAN? AND THAT'S AN AGING PIECE OF INFRASTRUCTURE. IT'S 365 MILES OF UNDERGROUND PIPING AN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS AS MUCH AS 100 YEARS OLD. AND IT'S FAILING IN A LOT OF WAYS. THERE WAS A QUESTION SPECIFICALLY ABOUT WHY CAN'T WE HIRE A CONSULTANT TO GET A BETTER PLAN OF HOW TO HANDLE THIS? AND ACTUALLY, FORTUNATELY, WE HAVE HIRED A CONSULTANT TO DO THAT. THEY ARE PUTTING TOGETHER AN ASSET MANAGEMENT PLAN, WHICH WILL BE A TEN-STEP PROCESS BY WHICH WE PLAN THE LONG-TERM CAPITAL NEEDS OF OUR DIFFERENT INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS. WE HAVE ALREADY DONE THIS FOR OUR ROADS. SO YOU MAY HAVE HEARD SOME BUZZ ABOUT A NEW ROADS PLAN THAT CAME OUT IN 2016. AND THIS IS ONE OF OUR FINAL INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS THAT DESPERATELY NEEDS THIS AND WE'RE FINALLY DOING IT, WHICH I'M GLAD THAT WE ARE. ANOTHER PIECE, AS YOU PROBABLY HEARD SOME DRAMA IN LIKE AROUND 2014, ABOUT FOOTING DRAIN DISCONNECTS. AND SUMP PUMPS. A LOT OF CONTROVERSY THAT SURROUNDED THAT DEBATE BEFORE MY TIME IN PUBLIC OFFICE. BUT ESSENTIALLY, STORMWATER WOULD FLUSH THROUGH PEOPLE'S HOUSES AND GET INTO THE SAP SANITARY SEWERS AND THEN FLOOD THE SEWAGE OUT INTO PEOPLE'S PES PROPERTIES AND THE STREETS. AND THAT'S DISCONNECTING HOMEOWNERS' FOOTING DRAINS FROM THE SANITARY SEWER TO AVOID THAT TYPE OF PROBLEM. SO THERE'S KIND OF THREE DIFFERENT AREAS. THERE'S TREATMENT PLANT ITSELF, WHICH IS STATE-OF-THE-ART NOW FORTUNATELY. THERE'S THE FROMS THAT SITS BELOW OUR STREETS WHICH IS 365 MILES WHICH NEEDS SERIOUS WORK AND WE ARE FINALLY PUTTING TOGETHER A PLAN TO ATTACK IT. AND THEN THERE'S THE PROPERTY -- THE ISSUE AT THE SOURCE, AT PEOPLE'S HOMES, WHICH WAS, YOU KNOW, DEALT WITH ABOUT A HALF DECADE AGO. SO PROGRESS IS BEING MADE BUT NOT AS FAST AS IT NEEDS TO BE. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THAT UP. THE QUESTION FOR STAFF, WE TALKED ABOUT SANITARY SEWER A LONG TIME AGO, I REMEMBER THE CONVERSATION. I DON'T REMEMBER THE DETAILS OF IT. CAN YOU SHARE THE PROCESS BY WHICH STAFF REVIEWS DEVELOPMENTS' IMPACT ON SANITARY SEWAGE AND THE SYSTEM AND WHAT THE COURSE OF ACTION WOULD BE IF THIS PROPERTY IS PERMITTED?
00:37:32.546: >> YEAH, WE DO HAVE AN ENGINEER ON STAFF THAT DOES LOOK AT THE SANITARY SEWER MITIGATION TO SEE IF IT'S SIZED CORRECTLY. I WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK AND LOOK BUT IF IT HAS GOTTEN TO THIS STAGE, WE KNOW IF THEY ARE ADDING SANITARY TO THE SYSTEM, THEY COULD PROBABLY EITHER PAY THEIR WAY OUT OR MITIGATE OUT TO GET OUT THE SANITARY MITIGATION ISSUES. I COULD GO BACK IN AND LOOK AT THE -- AS THE STAFF REPORT, SEE IF THE PIPES ARE, INDEED, SIZED CORRECTLY, BUT THEY WILL BE PROVIDING SOME TYPE OF MONETARY MITIGATION FOR THE SANITARY OR THE FLOW THAT'S BEING ADDED TO THE SYSTEM. BUT I DON'T RECALL THAT THERE WERE ANY ISSUES WITH IT, BUT I CAN LOOK WHILE WE ARE DISCUSSING IT FURTHER. THE PETITIONER MAY KNOW OFF THE TOP OF HIS HEAD WHAT THOSE COMMENTS WERE.
00:38:16.923: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YEAH, EITHER WAY IS FINE. THAT WAS LAST QUESTION FOR NOW FROM ME. SO HAPPY TO HEAR OTHER COLLEAGUES' THOUGHTS AND QUESTIONS AS WELL. MR. COVERT, IF YOU HAVE AN ANSWER, HAPPY TO TAKE IT NOW.
00:38:27.968: >> Planning Manager:  WHILE HE'S COMING UP NOW, AS IT RELATES TO THE SOURCE CHALLENGE THAT YOU REFERENCED. POLICY OF CITY IS THAT THOSE ARE FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTIONS THAT THE CITY USES TOWARDS CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMMING TO HELP THE SYSTEM IN A LARGER BASIS. SO WHILE THAT SOURCE REDUCTION IS STILL OCCURRING, IT IS NOW OCCURRING THROUGH A MORE SORT OF CENTRALIZED AND PRIORITIZED PROCESS IN THE PAST, WHERE IT WAS MORE -- MORE SCATTERED THROUGHOUT AND IMPLEMENTED ON A PROPERTY OWNER BY PROPERTY OWNER METHOD.
00:39:02.202: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU.
00:39:07.474: >> SO WITH REGARD TO THIS PROJECT, THE CITY ENGINEERING STAFF HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE BASICALLY THE NUMBER OF HOMES THAT WE'RE ADDING TO THE SITE, OR ADDING TO THIS PROPERTY, AND PUTTING THAT INTO THE MODEL FOR BOTH WATER AND WASTEWATER, SANITARY SEWER, AND THROUGH THAT MODEL, WHAT THEY HAVE SHOWN IS THAT THERE ISN'T AREAS THAT WOULD NEED TO BE UPGRADED OFFSITE THAT WOULD ALLOW THE SITE AND THE WHOLE INFRASTRUCTURE AS IT SITS TODAY TO WORK BETTER. IT WORKS PROPERLY. THE ADDITION OF THIS WOULD NOT CAUSE ISSUE. WE HAVE DETERMINED THROUGH THE CALCULATIONS THAT BRETT REFERS TO, WITH REGARD TO SANITARY SEWER MITIGATION, THAT WE HAVE TO MITIGATE ABOUT  54 GALLONS PER MINUTE AND WE WOULD BE PARTICIPATING IN THAT PROGRAM.
00:39:57.057: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU.
00:39:57.991: >> MM-HMM.
00:39:59.793: >> Chair Milshteyn: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COMMISSIONER SAUVE.
00:40:07.968: >> Commissioner Sauve: SO I HAVE TWO SMALL QUESTIONS. ONE IS FOR THE DEVELOPER. TIMELINE, IF THIS IS APPROVED FOR SITE WORK TO GO ON. BECAUSE I KNOW THERE'S A REQUEST, YOU KNOW, TO HOLD OFF SO THAT THERE COULD BE MAYBE WORK DONE IN THE BACKGROUND TO SORT OUT THIS HISTORIC HOME. WHAT IS YOUR PROJECTED TIMELINE FOR THE WORK ON THE SITE?
00:40:31.191: >> WELL, GIVEN THE CONSTRAINTS THE GENERAL TIME, I WOULD ASSUME IF IT WOULD GO THROUGH THE NORMAL PROCESS, WHATEVER YOUR RECOMMENDATION WOULD BE TONIGHT, IT WOULD BE SENT ON TO COUNCIL, AND IT'S TWO READINGS THERE. THERE'S A COUPLE OF MONTHS. AND THEN IT GOES -- ONCE IT WOULD BE -- ASSUMING IT WOULD BE APPROVED THERE, YOU PROBABLY HAVE THREE TO FOUR MONTHS OF DESIGN BEFORE WE COULD BE READY TO PULL ANY PERMITS. SO PROBABLY SIX TO EIGHT MONTHS.
00:41:01.821: >> Commissioner Sauve: SO YOU HAVEN'T STARTED BUILDING PERMIT PREPARATION FOR DRAWINGS ON THAT END?
00:41:07.260: >> NO. NO. AND IF -- YOU KNOW, AGAIN, JUST SO EVERYONE IS CLEAR, I DO NOT CONTROL THAT HOUSE. THAT AS NOT PART OF THIS WHOLE -- MY PURCHASE AGREEMENT. NOT PART OF WHAT'S GOING ON HERE. BUT THE OWNER OF THE -- THE CURRENT OWNER OF THE PROPERTY, WHICH I HAVE AN AGREEMENT WITH, HAS TALKED TO SOME OF THE PEOPLE AND IS WILLING TO WORK WITH THEM TO A POINT ON IT, AND I JUST -- SO I DON'T SEE WHY SOMETHING LIKE THAT, IF THE -- SOMEONE THAT WANTED TO DO THAT, AND MOVE IT WAS SERIOUS, THEY WOULD HAVE TO GET MOVING BUT I DON'T SEE WHERE THAT WOULD CAUSE A PROBLEM AT THIS TIME.
00:41:49.135: >> Commissioner Sauve: OKAY.
00:41:49.736: >> BUT I WOULD LIKE THE NOMENCLATURE, THIS IS NOT AN HISTORIC HOUSE. THERE'S NO DEZ DESIGNATION. NO ONE HAS INSPECTED IT. IT'S NOT BEEN DESIGNATED. IT'S AN OLD HOUSE. IT'S BEEN MODIFIED MANY, MANY TIMES OVER THE YEARS. SO IT'S VERY DISINGENUOUS TO SAY IT'S AN HISTORIC HOUSE.
00:42:13.460: >> Commissioner Sauve: I HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION FOR YOU. LOOKING AT THE PROPOSED VERNACULAR OF THE HOMES ON SITE, THERE'S PREVIOUS CORRESPONDENCE THAT ASKED ABOUT SOLAR READY. AND ONE OF THOSE THINGS IS JUST ROOF ORIENTATION TO THE SOUTH SO THAT IF ONLY OWNERS IN THE FUTURE WANTED TO PUT SOLAR PANELS ON IT, THERE WAS AT LEAST A HIGHER USE AREA TO USE SOLAR GAIN. AND I GUESS MY QUESTION IS IN THE HOUSING TYPOLOGY PROPOSED, A LOT OF THOSE ROOFS ARE KIND OF PITCHING EAST-WEST INSTEAD OF NORTH-SHOUSOUTH AND SO LIMITD SOUTHERN GAINS. IN TERMS OF THOSE TYPOLOGIES, ARE THOSE WHAT SPECIFICALLY WE'RE EXPECTING OR DO YOU MAYBE HAVE OTHER HOUSING TYPOLOGY WITHIN YOUR KIND OF DESIGN WHEEL HOUSE THAT YOU COULD LOOK AT MORE SOUTHERN EXPOSED ROOF STRUCTURES.
00:43:08.882: >> AT THIS POINT, WHAT IS, YOU KNOW, SHOWN ON THERE IS WHAT WE INTEND TO BUILD.
00:43:16.589: >> Commissioner Sauve: THOSE HOUSES.
00:43:17.690: >> NOW THERE'S SEVERAL WAYS YOU CAN GET EXPOSURE TO THE SOUTH WITH THAT, BUT THERE ARE THINGS THAT YOU CAN'T JUST -- YOU HAVE A LOT OF OTHER REGULATIONS IN THE CITY OF HOW I HAVE TO ORIENTATE LOTS, SIZES, SETBACKS, ROADS, DISTANCE BETWEEN ROADS. I DIDN'T WRITE THOSE RULES. THE CITY DID. I'M TRYING TO FOLLOW THEM.
00:43:36.910: >> Commissioner Sauve: RIGHT. AND WE GOT -- I THINK THE OTHER THING I'M SEEING HERE, WE GOT THE CONNECTED UNITS IN THE MIDDLE THAT -- AND THAT'S WHERE WE ACTUALLY HAVE THE LEAST AMOUNT OF SHADE AND SO UNDERSTANDING THAT RESTRUCTURING IN SOLAR GAIN AND I'M TRYING TO GET AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE YOU MIGHT HAVE FLEXIBILITY AND WHERE WE HAVE KIND OF A LONGER NARRATIVE ABOUT TIMELINE, TO KNOW IF THERE IS OPPORTUNITY BEYOND TONIGHT, YOU KNOW, WHERE THOSE CONVERSATIONS GO.
00:44:03.469: >> WE ARE LOOKING AT ANYTHING THAT MAKES SENSE THAT IS FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC TO PURCHASE THE HOUSE.
00:44:11.077: >> Commissioner Sauve: YEP.
00:44:12.078: >> A GOOD MARKET AND SOMEONE THAT WANTS TO LIVE IN THERE IS GOOD BUSINESS. AND GOOD FOR EVERYBODY, INCLUDING US. I SURE CAN'T MAKE ANY GUARANTEES OF HOW THEY ARE GOING TO BE ORIENTATED OR THAT. I'M ASKED TO LIVE BY THE RULES THAT WERE PUT BEFORE ME, WHICH IS WHAT I DID. IF THEY WANT TO LOOK AFTER SOMETHING AS APPROVED AND MOVING FORWARD, I'M SURE WILLING TO TALK BUT IT MAKES SENSE. AT THIS TIME, I WILL NOT COMMIT TO SOMETHING THAT I DON'T KNOW.
00:44:46.412: >> Commissioner Sauve: IF -- IF WE PUT SOLAR ORIENTATION, DO YOU SEE ANY CONFLICT WITH ANY OTHER RULES ON THIS PUD WITH THE ORIENTATIONS AT THIS POINT? JUST LOOKING AT THE VERNACULAR OF THE THING, ADJUSTING ROOF LINES DOESN'T -- IT SEEMS SUBSTANTIAL DEVIATIONS TO WHAT A SETBACK WOULD BE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.
00:45:17.010: >> Planning Manager:  NO, I DON'T SEE BARRIERS. THE ONLY BARRIER I WOULD SEE IS ANY CONTACT WITH THE PRESERVED WOODLAND OR LANDMARK TREES. THOSE ARE OFTEN ALSO IN CONFLICT BUT THERE'S NOTHING INHERENT AND FROM MY LENS, YOU KNOW, THE PETITIONER IS RIGHT, WE SPECIFY A LOT ABOUT HOW THE PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT HAPPENS. I PRESUME THAT THERE'S PROBABLY A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY IN HOW THE ACTUAL ROOFLINE IS REALIZED ON THOSE STRUCTURES AND SOME THINK IT'S THE ATTACHED UNIT, A SHARED RIDGE THAT SPANS OVER MULTIPLE UNITS VERSUS SOMETHING THAT HAS SOUTHERN EXPOSURE MIGHT BE MORE CHALLENGING. NO, I DON'T -- IN SHORT, I DON'T SEE INHERENT CONFLICTS OTHER THAN WHERE THOSE WERE MADE, HAVE LIMITED SOLAR EXPOSURE BECAUSE OF THE NATURAL RESOURCES WE ARE TRYING TO PRESERVE.
00:46:06.759: >> Commissioner Sauve: OKAY. I WILL LEAVE THAT THERE FOR NOW.
00:46:10.063: >> I WILL CONCUR.
00:46:11.464: >> Chair Milshteyn: I HAVE A FOLLOW-UP QUESTION. YOU HAD MENTIONED THAT YOU DON'T OWN THE HOUSE AND PRESENTLY YOU DON'T OWN THE PROPERTY; IS THAT CORRECT?
00:46:19.739: >> I HAVE AN AGREEMENT ON IT. I HAVE ENOUGH MONEY IN IT, I WILL BE BUYING IT.
00:46:24.210: >> Chair Milshteyn: ALL RIGHT. SO THE QUESTION IS IN REGARDS TO DOES YOUR CONTRACT STATE THAT THE HOUSE MUST BE REMOVED BY THE SELLER PRIOR TO CLOSING? IS THAT SOMETHING THAT'S STATED IN YOUR CONTRACT?
00:46:35.254: >> I CAN'T REMEMBER -- IT'S NOT PRIOR TO CLOSING, NO. I THINK THE AGREEMENT IS HE CAN DO WITH THE HOUSE WHATEVER HE CHOOSES, AS LONG AS IT IS GONE BEFORE I BREAK -- I THINK THE WORDING WAS CANNOT HOLD UP SITE DEVELOPMENT. SO NOT CLOSING. IT'S NOT A CLOSING.
00:46:55.141: >> Chair Milshteyn: SO WHEN YOU CLOSE ON THE PROPERTY, YOU KNOW, IF ALL GOES WELL AND YOU GET CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL, YOU CLOSE ON THE PROPERTY, TECHNICALLY, YOU OWN THE HOUSE AT THIS POINT, OTHER THAN YOU MAY HAVE A RENTAL AGREEMENT OR SOME SORT OF AN AGREEMENT.
00:47:07.920: >> THAT'S CORRECT. THERE IS NO RENTAL AGREEMENT AND THERE WON'T BE. JUST THAT'S A GIVEN.
00:47:13.826: >> Chair Milshteyn: OKAY. THANK YOU.
00:47:15.361: >> YEP.
00:47:15.828: >> Chair Milshteyn: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL?
00:47:19.065: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall:  I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE ON TO THE NATURAL FEATURES PORTION OF THIS. SO FIRST FOR STAFF, SO WHEN I WENT THROUGH THE DRAWING CELT AND ALL THE NOTES -- SET AND ALL THE NOTES IT TALKED ABOUT A THREE-YEAR PLAN BUT IN THE STAFF REPORT, IT SAID A FIVE-YEAR PLAN. I WONDER IF YOU CAN CLARIFY, IF THERE ARE THINGS THAT YOU KNOW HOW DER DEFINING CONSTRUCTION PERIOD AND MAINTENANCE STARTS AND IS THAT DISCREPANCY AND HOW IS THAT WORKING?
00:47:49.929: >> YES, WE HAD A COUPLE OF NATURAL FEATURE MAINTENANCE PLANS ON A COUPLE OF OTHER PROJECTS AND THEY REFER TO THREE YEARS THAT WE HAVE DONE. I DID TALK WITH THE FORRESTER WHO DID THE REVIEW. SHE WAS COMFORTABLE WITH A FIVE-YEAR MAINTENANCE PLAN. SO I THINK WE COULD BE A LITTLE FLEXIBLE ON THAT AND I HAVE GOT SOME LANGUAGE THAT WE COULD ADD TO THE DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT. SO THEY HAVE STATED THREE WHICH WAS APPROVED BY NAP, THE FORRESTER SAID FIVE BUT I THINK WE HAVE SOME FLEXIBILITY IN THERE.
00:48:17.557: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall:  OKAY. GO AHEAD IF YOU HAVE A COMMENT.
00:48:20.393: >> I WAS PRESIDENT -- OR AREN'T PRESENT AT ALL OF THOSE MEETINGS AND BASICALLY IT WENT FROM TWO TO FIVE YEARS. WE ARE HAPPY WITH ANY OF IT BECAUSE WE WILL WRITE IT IN THERE BUT WHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO COME UP WITH IS SOMETHING THAT WAS DYNAMIC TO REVIEW IT AND NAP WANTED TO LOOK AT IT SAYING, OKAY, IT'S WORKING. OR THIS HAS WORKED AND NOW WE ARE ON TO STAGE TWO, BECAUSE WHAT YOU DO IN THE FIRST TWO YEARS IS -- IF YEAR ONE AND TWO OF THE PLAN WORK, THREE AND FOUR --
00:48:55.094: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall:  THAT'S RIGHT.
00:48:56.462: >> AND THREE AND FOUR SHOULD CHANGE. IF ONE AND TWO DIDN'T QUITE WORK, YOU MIGHT BE ANOTHER YEAR OR TWO UNTIL YOU GET INTO A LITTLE MORE MATURE PLAN. SO WE ARE OPEN, AND WE KICKED IT BACK AND FORTH TO HOW TO MEMORIALIZE THAT IN WRITING. AND PART OF IT IS A CONDOMINIUM. THERE WILL BE DOCUMENTS AND IT WILL BE VERY CLEARLY WRITTEN IN THERE AND WE HAVE DONE THAT IN OTHER DEVELOPMENTS, BUT WE THINK IT SHOULD BE DYNAMIC TOO, BECAUSE, AGAIN, JUST WHAT'S GOOD IN YEAR ONE AND TWO MAY NOT BE GOOD IN YEAR TEN.
00:49:33.833: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall:  I'M REALLY GLAD TO HEAR THAT BECAUSE I TOTALLY ALY AGREE WITH WHAT YOUE SAYING. WE DON'T KNOW HOW  UNTIL WE LOOK AT HOW THINGS RESPOND. IT LOOK LIKE THERE'S QUITE A BIT OF FLEXIBILITY IN THERE AND THAT THE CITY WAS BEING INFORMED IN A CONSISTENT WAY AT THE END OF EVERY YEAR TO BE ABLE TO REVIEW AND TO BE ABLE TO CHECK THINGS OUT. SO THAT -- AND I'M ALSO GLAD THAT YOU SAT DOWN WITH NAP, BECAUSE THEY DO THIS ALL DAY LONG.
00:49:58.658: >> MM-HMM.
00:49:58.958: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall:  SO THEY HAVE A LOT OF EXPERTISE WITH THAT. WITH. THAT SO THAT MAKES ME FEEL A LOT BETTER ABOUT THIS ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO KEEP EVOLVING IN THE WAY IT NEEDS TO, TO HAVE THOSE OAKS AND WALNUTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT REGENERATE. SO I'M GLAD YOU SAT DOWN WITH THEM. I WANTED TO UNDERSTAND THE DISCREPANCY PIECE, BUT IN YOUR NOTES, IT STILL GAVE A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY FOR HOW IT EVOLVES INTO THE FUTURE. IT DIDN'T SHUT THE DOOR ON THAT. I'M GLAD TO SEE THAT AS WELL AND ALL NOTES WITH THE HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR. THE REPORTS HIRING A QUALIFIED CONTRACTOR, THINGS LIKE, THAT DEFINING, MORE TARGETED HERBICIDE REGIMES. BECAUSE, AGAIN, YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW UNTIL THEY GET IN THERE TO SEE HOW THINGS -- HOW THINGS WOULD BE WORKING. I FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH WHERE THE NATURAL FEATURES PORTION IS, IN TERMS OF THE ONGOING MANAGEMENT AND THE STEWARDSHIP IN THOSE AREAS. IF THIS PLAN GOES FORWARD IN THE WAY THAT THE NOTES ARE THERE BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY AND STILL CITY -- CERTAIN OVERSIGHT. NOT A LOT OF MANAGEMENT WEEK TO WEEK OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, BUT THAT THEY HAVE TO -- THEY CHECK -- THEY ARE CHECKING IN. SO I THINK SOME REAL WORK WAS DONE BETWEEN THE LAST ITERATION THAT WE HAVE AND THE ITERATION THAT WE HAVE NOW. SO FOR ME, THIS IS A BIG PART OF THIS PUD, IN TERMS OF WHAT WE ARE GETTING OUT OF THIS AND FOR ME, THE -- THE ATTACHED UNITED ALLOW THESE AREAS TO BE SAVED AND NOT JUST SAVED BUT RESTORED. AND THAT'S THE PIECE THAT MEANS, I THINK, MOST TO ME. AS SOMEBODY WHO DOES THIS FOR A LIVING, IS THAT IT TAKES MANAGEMENT, BASICALLY. WE HAVE TO BE INVOLVED IN ORDER TO HAVE THESE THINGS EVOLVE IN HEALTHY WAYS BECAUSE THERE'S JUST SO MANY INVASIVES OUT THERE. AND THE PLAN, AS I SEE, IT ACCOMMODATES THAT IN TERMS OF THE HUMAN INVOLVEMENT OVER TIME, THE CHECKING THAT IS GOING TO BE REQUIRED BY THE CITY, AND THE INVOLVEMENT OF NAP, WHO REALLY IS AN EXPERT IN ALL OF THIS, AND HAS DONE THIS A WHOLE LOT IN THIS AREA. SO I'M COMFORTABLE WITH THAT PORTION OF IT, IN TERMS OF THE PUD BENEFIT. I'M ALSO COMFORTABLE WITH THE STORMWATER PORTION  OF IT. ORDINARILY THIS HE COULD BYPASS EVERYTHING THAT'S FLOWING ON TO THEM, AND INSTEAD THEY ARE TAKING SOME OF THE PROBLEM AREAS OF NEIGHBORHOOD AND TAKING IT UNDER THEIR SIGHT WHICH IS HIGHLY UNUSUAL. THAT'S JUST NOT WHAT IS REQUIRED AT ALL. SO THOSE TWO PIECES FOR ME, IS TO PUSH IT INTO THE PUBLIC BENEFIT PIECE. FOR ME, THE HISTORIC HOUSE, I THINK IT WOULD BE FABULOUS IF SOME -- [ SIRENS ] DO WE NEED TO HEAD TO THE BASEMENT?
00:53:17.089: >> Chair Milshteyn: WE MAY BE GOING IN FOR A RECESS. LET'S JUST SEE WHERE WE ARE AT. IT'S JUST A FLASH FLOOD WARNING.
00:53:27.233: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall:  WE ARE UP ON THE SECOND FLOOR. WE WILL BE JUST FINE. [ LAUGHTER ] IN TERMS OF THE HISTORIC STRUCTURE, I THINK IT WOULD BE WONDERFUL IF SOME PRIVATE PERSON WANTED TO TAKE THIS ON TO BE ABLE TO MOVE IT TO PRIVATE LAND. I THINK IT'S -- IT WOULD BE A LOT FOR THE CITY TO BE ABLE TO TAKE THIS ON AND PUT THIS INTO A -- INTO A PARK, AND PAY FOR ALL OF THAT, AND MANAGE THE HOUSE AND, YOU KNOW, RESTORE IT. IT'S A LOT OF BUDG BUDGET TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS. I WOULD LOVE IF SOMEONE WANTED TO TAKE THIS ON TO THEIR PROJECT AND BE ABLE TO RESTORE IT IN THAT WAY IT, THAT WOULD BE WONDERFUL. THE CITY PROCESS WOULD HAVE TO PLAY ITSELF OUT IF THERE IS WILL AND CITY COUNCIL SEES ITS BENEFIT, AND THERE'S ENOUGH CITIZENS TO KIND OF SAY, IT'S WORTH MY TAXES TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS KIND OF THING, THEN -- THEN THAT'S GREAT. BUT I ALSO SEE THAT THE HISTORIC STRUCTURES TAKE A LOT OF TIME AND MONEY AND EFFORT TO BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN TOO. IT'S NOT JUST GETTING THEM THERE. IT'S FIXING THEM AND MAINTAINING THEM AND THEM INTERPRETED AND ALL OF THOSE THINGS. IT'S A CHUNK FOR THE CITY TO BE ABLE TO TAKE THAT ON. IF PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THAT'S HOW THEIR TAX DOLLARS WANT TO BE SPENT, I'M FINE WITH, THAT BUT I ALSO THINK THAT IT WOULD BE EASIER AND CLEANER, PERHAPS FOR A PRIVATE PERSON WHO WANTED TO BE ABLE TO TAKE IT ON THEMSELVES, BECAUSE I JUST THINK IT WOULD GO A LOT FASTER AND PROBABLY BE A LOT CLEANER PROCESS. SO THOSE ARE MY -- THAT'S MY READ ON THE THREE BIG CHUNKS FOR ME OF WHAT IS KIND OF LEFT TO DISCUSS ON THIS PROJECT.
00:55:13.439: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONE?
00:55:16.575: >> Vice Chair Mills: THANK YOU, COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL, BECAUSE I HAD LOTS OF QUESTIONS ON, LIKE, IS THIS -- PARTICULARLY ON THE NATURAL FEATURE BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S THE PRIMARY BENEFIT OR ONE OF THE KEY BENEFITS AND SO I APPRECIATE THAT. I THINK FOR EVERYONE ELSE AND I DON'T WANT TO PUT YOU ON THE SPOT, AND I WILL PUT STAFF ON THE SPOT. TO TALK THROUGH WHAT IS REQUIRED. WHAT IS THE BASIS THAT IS REQUIRED AS PART OF OUR CODE? HOW DOES THIS GO ABOVE AND BEYOND OF WHAT WE REQUIRE OF ANY NEW DEVELOPMENT?
00:55:47.373: >> WELL, THE NATURAL FEATURES MITIGATION PLAN IS NOT REQUIRED ON OTHER PROJECTS PER SE, PUT FOR THE PUD, THEY NEEDED A PUBLIC BENEFIT, SO AS PART OF THAT, WITH BOTH THE OPEN SPACE AT 54%, ALONG WITH THE MITIGATION PLAN, AND THE STORMWATER DETENTION, THIS WAS TRYING TO BEEF IT UP AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. TO GET INTO GREATER DITAIL, OTHER THAN TRYING TO PRESERVE THE EXISTING NATURAL FEATURES AND MAINTAINING THEM AND GETTING RID OF INVASIVES, I WOULD HAVE TO REFER TO THE PETITIONER IN GETTING INTO THE NATURAL FEATURES MITIGATION PLAN.
00:56:27.212: >> Vice Chair Mills: YEAH, THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. I'M ASSUMING THAT -- IF YOU SAY YOU ARE NOT CHOPPING DOWN THE TREE, YOU ARE NOT CHOPPING DOWN THE TREE BUT IN TERMS OF REMOVING THE INVASIVES, LIKE, IS THAT WHAT IS ADDED?
00:56:37.056: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall:  SO OUR CURRENT CODE BASICALLY MANAGES THE TREES BUT IT DOESN'T MANAGE THE KIND OF ECOSYSTEM OF THE WOODLANDS SO MUCH. SO IF HE WERE TO -- HE COULD JUST HAVE LAWN AROUND ALL OF THOSE TREES, LIKE IF HE WERE SAVING SOME LANDSCAPE -- SOME LANDMARK TREES, HE WOULDN'T BE REQUIRED TO HAVE ANY KIND OF ECOSYSTEM PIECE OF IT. NO SMALL TREES ARE EVER GOING TO GROW ON A LAWN THAT'S MOWED EVERY WEEK IN THE SUMMERTIME. SO OUR CURRENT SYSTEM IS SET UP JUST TO SAVE TREES, NOT TO SAVE A SYSTEM. AND SO THAT'S PART OF WHAT IS DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS PLAN, IS THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO SAVE A SYSTEM AND TO MANAGE IT AND STEWARD IT GOING FORWARD. THERE'S NOTHING IN OUR CODE THAT TALKS ABOUT THAT. WE WANT PEOPLE TO SAVE WOODLANDS BUT REALLY WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT, IN TERMS OF OUR CODE, THIS COULD PUT LAWN AROUND ALL OF THOSE TREES THAT -- THEY ARE ALLOWED TO DO THAT. THERE'S NOTHING IN OUR CODE THAT SAYS YOU HAVE TO LEAVE IT AS A FOREST FLOOR AND YOU HAVE TO MANAGE INVASIVES AND THERE'S NOTHING THAT ASKS PEOPLE TO DO THAT SPECIFICALLY.
00:57:47.192: >> Vice Chair Mills: OKAY. ONE OF THE THINGS I READ THROUGH, THE LITTLE BURR OAKS THAT ARE GROWING. THAT'S ONLY MENTIONED A COUPLE OF TIMES, AND WHAT I'M HEARING YOU SAY IS THAT THE FLEXIBILITY TO DEAL WITH THAT, LIKE, AND ALL OF THESE OTHER THINGS ABOUT DEALING WITH THE INVASIVES ARE WHAT IS GOING TO KEEP THOSE LITTLE BURR OAKS COMING UP? LIKE, HAVE A CHANCE OF BECOMING BIG BURR OAKS; IS THAT RIGHT?
00:58:14.186: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall:  RIGHT. RIGHT.
00:58:16.622: >> IT WAS THROUGH ALL OF THAT DISCUSSION THAT I LEARNED ABOUT IT TOO, BUT THAT WAS ONE OF THE BIG TOPICS WHERE I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS BROUGHT UP HERE, THEY READ IT -- I BELIEVE IT WAS AND THEY GO, WELL, THAT'S GREAT TO HAVE THEM AND SAY YOU ARE GOING TO DO THIS, BUT YOU HAVE NO MANAGE THEM AS THEY GET BIG. YOU DON'T WANT EIGHT TWO INCH ONES 2 FEET APART. YOU WANT TO BE DYNAMIC AND EVENTUALLY, FORTUNATELY, THE BIG ONE WILL GO. SOME POINT IN TIME, NATURAL DISASTER -- YOU KNOW, LIGHTNING, SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN. AND THEY WANT IT DYNAMIC ENOUGH THAT SOMETHING FAR ENOUGH AWAY IS GROWING AND HAS THE POTENTIAL TO GROW BIG ENOUGH TO, YOU KNOW, 200 YEARS DOWN THE ROAD REPLACE IT TYPE THING. THAT'S KIND OF GRANDIOSE, BUT IT'S THAT MANAGEMENT STYLE OF YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE WOOD LOT AS A WHOLE, BASICALLY, LIKE YOU ARE MANAGING A WOODS BUT YOU ARE LOOKING AT -- WE TALKED ABOUT, YEAH, IT'S NOT GOING TO BE' LAWN. YOU WILL HAVE TO KEEP -- YOU CAN'T JUST SET THERE AND SPRAY IT WITH ROUNDUP EVERY DAY. YOU KNOW, EVERY THREE MONTHS TO MANAGE THE WEEDS.
00:59:20.486: >> RIGHT. RIGHT.
00:59:21.487: >> YOU MIGHT DO IT AFTER THE FIRST COUPLE OF YEARS AND GET THE NEW STUFF STARTED AND THEN YOU GET THE NATIVE SPECIES AND I'M SURE NOT AN EXPERT ON IT, BUT I GET THE GIST OF IT, AND THIS IS FAR MORE DETAILED IN THAT TYPE OF MANAGEMENT THAN IT IS IN A -- I WANT TO SAY BOOTY Y MANAGEMENT AND LANDSCAPE OR SOMETHING THAT YOU LOOK AT FROM THE ROAD. THIS IS MORE OF THE ACTUAL ECOSYSTEM, NOT NECESSARILY WHAT LOOKS PRETTY. AND HOPEFULLY THEY ARE ONE AND THE SAME, BUT --
00:59:50.015: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall:  WHAT I SAW IN THE PLANS IS IN THE VERY BEGINNING, THERE'S QUITE A THOROUGH ASSESSMENT WITH N.A.P. TO UNDERSTAND WHERE THE LITTLE BABIES ARE, TO BE ABLE TO MANAGE AROUND THOSE, TO BE TARGETED ABOUT THE INVASIVES THAT YOU ARE REMOVING, SOME OF WHICH YOU MAY SPRAY, SOME OF WHICH YOU MAY CUT, AND SOME OF WHICH YOU MAY PULL. AND THAT THE FIRST COUPLE. YEARS ARE PRETTY INTENSIVE IN TERMS OF GETTING THOSE INVASIVES OUT OF THERE AND MANAGED. AND GOING FORWARD, LITTLE ONES MAY STILL COME UP AND THAT'S WHERE SOME OF THAT FLEXIBILITY PIECE COMES IN AND WHERE THEY ARE REPORTING TO THE CITY EVERY YEAR, TO BE ABLE TO SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING AND THE CITY HAS THE ABILITY TO COME OUT AND CHECK TO SEE OVER TIME. AND I THINK YOUR BIGGEST CHALLENGE IS GOING TO BE -- YOU DON'T KNOW WHO IS GOING TO MOVE IN HERE. WHO WILL BE THE PRESIDENT OF YOUR HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION. I HAVE THINK IT HAS TO BE VERY CLEAR FROM THE START, YOU KNOW, THAT THAT IS THEIR RESPONSIBILITY. THEY ARE A STEWARD OF THESE THINGS AND THE ONLY REASON THOSE HOUSES ARE THERE IS BECAUSE OF THAT. AND THAT HAS TO BE, LIKE -- BECAUSE YOU GET THE WRONG -- THE PERSON WITH THE KIND OF WRONG AESTHETIC THAT REALLY WANTS TO MOW THE WHOLE THING DOWN, YOU KNOW, THAT'S -- THIS IS WHY THIS DEVELOPMENT CAN HAPPEN THE WAY THAT IT IS. AND SO THAT HAS TO BE MADE REALLY CLEAR BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHO THAT PERSONALITY IS AND THAT PERSONALITY WILL CHANGE OVER TIME. PEOPLE WILL MOVE. YOU KNOW, SO SOMEHOW THE KIND OF MANTLE OF RESPONSIBILITY AND STEWARDSHIP FOR MAINTAINING THIS SOMEHOW DELIVERING THAT MESSAGE -- WHICH I SAW IN YOUR TEXT, BUT, STILL LIKE THE EMOTIONAL PIECE LIKE, REALLY -- YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE TAKING ON HERE? YOU KNOW, THAT THAT'S I THINK GOING BE TO THE BIGGEST POSSIBILITY FOR SLIPPAGE IN TERMS OF THAT. BUT THE CITY IS STILL OBSERVING AS IT GOES ALONG, AND SO IF SOME YAHOO GOES IN THERE AND REALLY WANTS IT TO BE ALL LAWN, THAT WOULD GET CAUGHT IN THE PROCESS, YOU KNOW, IF THAT WERE TO HAPPEN.
01:01:36.255: >> I THINK YOU SAT IN ON THE DISCUSSION BECAUSE THAT WAS DEFINITELY PART OF IT, BECAUSE I ACTUALLY WAS TALKING ABOUT THAT, BECAUSE I'VE GOT 30 PLUS YEARS OF WORKING WITH ASSOCIATIONS AND PRESIDENTS AFTER WE LEAVE, INFORMINGER ANDR HOMEOWNERS AND THAT IS A CONCERN. WHOEVER THE PRESIDENT IS TAKES ON THE MOST FORCEFUL PERSONALITY OF THAT ASSOCIATION. SO N.A.P. AND ACTUALLY US -- BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, WE ARE TRYING -- WE SAY WE ARE TRYING TO PUT IN THERE RIGHT AND THAT WAS HOW TO GET THE EXPERT AND, YOU KNOW, WE FIGURED A YEAR WAS ABOUT RIGHT. YOU KNOW, HOWEVER YOU SET IT UP, IF IT'S IN THE SPRING, AND WHEN STUFF STARTS, SO WHOEVER THAT PRESIDENT IS, HERE'S REPORT FOR THE YEAR. HERE'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.
01:02:29.107: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall:  AND THEY HAVE TO INVOLVE -- THAT'S GIST OF HOW IT HAPPENS. BUT THAT'S PART OF THE DISCUSSION OF HOW THAT WORKS.
01:02:35.580: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall:  AND THEY HAVE TO HIRE A CONSULTANT. IT'S NOT JUST THE HOMEOWNER'S ASSOCIATION PRESIDENT THAT'S OUT THERE FIGURING OUT WHAT ARE SEEDLINGS. SO THERE'S A CONSULTANT BUILT INTO THIS, OF WHICH THERE ARE SEVERAL IN THE ANN ARBOR AREA. AND SO THERE'S PLENTY OF PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. SO THERE'S ANOTHER WAY TO KIND OF BUILD IN SECURITY WITH THAT.
01:02:57.836: >> PART OF THAT DISCUSSION WAS N.A.P. DIDN'T WANT TO GET INVOLVED IN DICTATING THE PLAN. THEY WANTED TO REACT TO A PLAN THAT IS CURRENT AND DYNAMIC, AND WITH WHATEVER THE BEST PRACTICES OF THE DAY ARE. AND THEY DIDN'T WANT TO BE THE DEVELOPER AND THE POLICE.
01:03:19.624: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall:  RIGHT.
01:03:20.525: >> THEY WANTED, HOPEFULLY IT GETS DEVELOPED. THEY APPROVE IT AND IT GETS DONE. AND THEN, YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY, THEY ARE JUST THE POLICE. THEY DIDN'T WANT TO BE BOTH SIDES OF IT.
01:03:32.537: >> Vice Chair Mills: RIGHT. I READ IT AND I DIDN'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW IT WAS. THAT'S REALLY HELPFUL. FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE, MR. CHENG, WAS THERE ANYTHING THAT N.A.P. WISHES THIS WOULD INCLUDE? BECAUSE --
01:03:43.482: >> YEAH, I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BUT I DID LOOK UP SOME LANGUAGE THAT I CAN ADD INTO THE DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT THAT WOULD ADDRESS SOME OF THESE ISSUES ALSO.
01:03:51.056: >> Vice Chair Mills: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I THINK THAT INCLUDING THAT, MAKING SURE THAT THE DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT IS CLEAR ON THAT AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS GOING FORWARD IS REALLY IMPORTANT. I HAD TWO MORE SHORT QUESTIONS. ONE IS REGARDING THE SOLAR ORIENTATION. WE HAVE TALKED A LOT ABOUT THE DETACHED STRUCTURES ON THE OUTSKIRTS. I DIDN'T SEE -- I MEAN I -- DO YOU HAVE THE ELEVATIONS FOR THE ATTACHED STRUCKORS? MAYBE YOU WENT -- STRUCTURES. MAYBE YOU WENT OVER THEM IN THE PRESENTATION, AND I DIDN'T SEE IT.
01:04:28.727: >> THERE WASN'T ELEVATIONS OF THE ATTACHED STRUCKORS BUT THEY ANTICIPATE THE UNITS -- STRUCTURES BUT THEY ANTICIPATE THE UNITS BEING SIMILAR TO THESE, JUST ATTACHED TO GO.
01:04:38.570: >> Vice Chair Mills: OKAY. GOT IT. IS THAT TYPICAL FOR US TO NOT SEE AL ELEVATIONS FOR US AT THE SITE PLAN LEVELS.
01:04:49.314: >> WE TYPICALLY DO HAVE ELEVATIONS. AND WE CAN ADD IT BEFORE IT GOES ON TO CITY COUNCIL IF WE WANT SOMETHING MORE CONCRETE.
01:04:57.889: >> Vice Chair Mills: YEAH. WE ALWAYS SEE ELEVATIONS AND SO -- YEAH. IN PARTICULAR, THE THING THAT WAS IN MY MIND, I THINK -- IF THEY WERE, YOU KNOW, DUPLEXES OR SOMETHING THAT ARE ATTACHED. IF THEY HAVE A FLAT ROOF, THEY SHOULD BE SOLAR READY. I WOULD NOT -- THAT'S LIKE NONNEGOTIABLE IN MY MIND. THAT SHOULD BE SOLAR READY. AND SO THAT WE DON'T KNOW. I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT FLAT ROOF WOULD FIT IN THIS VERNACULAR, BUT EVEN SO WE HAVE SOME ATTACHED THAT HAVE FLAT ROOFS. YEAH. THE OTHER THING THAT GOT BROUGHT UP THAT YOU WENT OVER VERY BRIEFLY IN YOUR REMARKS AN I JUST WANTED TO ADDRESS WAS THE SQUARE FOOTAGE AND WHETHER OR NOT BASEMENTS COUNT. IF THAT IS HOW WE INTERPRET R1E THAT BASEMENTS COUNT FOR THAT, I THINK THAT -- THE PLAN IS TO CONTINUE ENFORCING THAT, THAT BASEMENTS COUNT TOWARDS YOUR SQUARE FOOTAGE?
01:05:59.284: >> IT'S IN ALL ZONING DISTRICTS THAT IT WOULD BE COUNTED.
01:06:02.988: >> Vice Chair Mills: SPEAKING FOR MYSELF, I COULD NOT IMAGINE CHANGING THAT IN THIS. YEAH. GO AHEAD.
01:06:11.463: >> Chair Milshteyn: SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE SO THE SQUARE FOOTAGE, THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ABOVE GRADE AND BELOW GRADE SQUARE FOOTAGE. I BELIEVE THE R1E IS BELOW GRADE. IS THAT CORRECT?
01:06:28.213: >> Planning Manager:  NO. IN THE UDC, WE RELY ON A DEAF NATION AS MORE SPECIFIC NOW THAT WE HAVE SPECIFIC THINGS WE EXCLUDE BUT IT INCLUDES FLOOR AREA, BOTH ABOVE AND BELOW GRADE. SO A. -- THIS STRUCTURE UNDER THE R1E WOULD HAVE TO MEET THE 2,000 SQUARE FOOT THRESHOLD. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THEY ARE PROPOSING TO SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDE THE BASEMENT SQUARE FOOTAGE FROM CALCULATION OF THAT 2,000 SQUARE FEET.
01:06:57.475: >> Vice Chair Mills: IS THAT WRITTEN SOMEWHERE OR --
01:06:59.377: >> YES, BUT WE -- SINCE THIS IS BEING REZONED OR BEING PROPOSED FOR REZONE FOR PUD, IT'S IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS.
01:07:06.851: >> Vice Chair Mills: THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD NOT COUNT THE BASEMENTS TOWARDS THAT SQUARE FOOTAGE?
01:07:12.991: >> THAT'S CORRECT.
01:07:13.425: >> Planning Manager:  IT WAS HIGHLIGHTED IN THE STAFF REPORT AS A NOTABLE CHANGE.
01:07:17.295: >> Vice Chair Mills: RIGHT, EXACTLY. I THINK THAT THAT WENT -- I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT BEFORE, AND SINCE THAT WOULD CHANGE HOW SQUARE FOOTAGE IS CALCULATED HERE, VERSUS EVERYWHERE ELSE, I APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THAT TO OUR ATTENTION. THE REASON FOR THE R1E TO BE CLEAR, CAP ON SQUARE FOOTAGE IS SO THAT WE TRY TO DIVERSIFY OUR HOUSING STOCK AND GET SOME SMALLISH UNITS, 2,000 SQUARE FEET IS NOT SMALL, BUT SMALLISH UNITS. AND TO POTENTIALLY ALLOW THE SQUARE FOOTAGE. THIS COULD THEN -- YOU COULD FINISH YOUR BASEMENT AND IT COULD BECOME 3,000 SQUARE FEET. THAT IS COUNTER TO THE INTENTION OF THE EXISTING ZONING DISTRICT, AND WOULD RUN COUNTER TO THE -- ONE OF THE PUBLIC BENEFITS OF DIVERSIFYING HOUSING TYPES. SO THANK YOU. I'M HAPPY FOR OTHER COMMENTS, BUT I WILL BE MAKING A MOTION TO AMEND -- TO STRIKE THAT FROM THE DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT. YEAH.
01:08:25.230: >> Planning Manager:  WELL, I -- I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT -- I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PLANNING COMMISSION IS CLEAR. THE FLOOR AREA UNDER THE CODE REQUIRES MEASUREMENT OF ALL FLOOR AREA, BE IT ABOVE OR BELOW GRADE. SO UNDER THE NORMAL -- A NORMAL FLOOR AREA CALCULATION, SPECIFIC TO THE R1E, WE WOULD COUNT THE BASEMENT. IN THIS CASE, THEY ARE SPECIFICALLY PROPOSING TO EXCLUDE THAT FROM THE CALCULATION. THAT COULD RESULT IN THE 3,000 SQUARE FOOT HOUSE, BUT I ALSO WOULD NOTE THAT THIS WOULD STILL HAVE THAT 2,000 SQUARE FOOT AREA LIMIT ON THE HOUSE. EVEN IF IT WERE ONLY APPLYING TO ABOVE GRADE, WHICH IS NOT RESTRICTION IN ANY OTHER DISTRICT. I AGREE. I MEAN I THINK WHAT YOU ARE WRESTLING WITH -- AND I THINK IT'S VALID, IS THAT I THINK THE INTENT OF THE R1E WAS TO TRY AND INCENT VERY MODEST-SIZED STRUCTURES THAT IF ONLY BY THEIR SHEER SIZE MIGHT BE POTENTIALLY MORE AFFORDABLE AND PROVIDE MORE FLEXIBILITY. SO I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT THIS IS PROBABLY NOT THE MEETING THE ORIGINAL R1E CAP, BUT IT'S MEETING IT LIKE EVERY OTHER RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT IN THE CITY. THAT IS IF IT WERE ZONED TO ANYTHING ELSE, THERE WOULD BE NO CAP. YOU COULD PUT A 5,000 SQUARE FOOT HOME, PROVIDED IT MET THE SETBACK REQUIREMENTS.
01:09:54.586: >> Vice Chair Mills: BUT THE CURRENT ZONING THAT WE ARE GOING FROM RIGHT NOW. IT'S CURRENTLY ZONED R1E.
01:10:00.992: >> Planning Manager: CORRECT.
01:10:01.893: >> Vice Chair Mills: WHICH HAS A SQUARE FOOTAGE CAP.
01:10:03.962: >> Planning Manager: CORRECT.
01:10:05.029: >> Vice Chair Mills: AND THIS IS THE REZONING. SO THIS IS THE CHANCE -- IF SOMEONE WANTED TO MAKE THIS R1D OR R1A, THEY WOULD HAVE TO -- WHICH WOULD LIFT THAT CAP.
01:10:13.438: >> Planning Manager: CORRECT.
01:10:15.240: >> Vice Chair Mills: THEY WOULD HAVE TO COME BEFORE US IN THE SAME PROCESS AND WE WOULD HAVE NO ASSESS WHETHER IT MEETS THE STASTANDARDS SET FORTH TO WARRAT A REZONING. SO, YEAH.
01:10:27.218: >> Chair Milshteyn: SO JUST TO BE CLEAR ON THAT TOPIC. SO THE BUILDER CAN PUT UP A 2,000 SQUARE FOOT HOUSE AND NOT FINISH THE BASEMENT, AND A MONTH AFTERWARDS, AFTER CLOSING, THE NEW HOMEOWNER CAN FINISH THE BASEMENT AND HAVE ANOTHER 1,000 SQUARE FEET AND THERE WOULDINGNO RESTRICTIONS ON THAT?
01:10:52.644: >> Planning Manager:  THAT'S ISSUE WE WANTED EVERYONE TO BE CLEAR OF. THAT'S WHY WE CLARIFIED OUR DEFINITIONS. IN THE PAST, WE HAD A MUCH MORE COMPLICATED DEFINITION THAT YOU RECALL REFERRED TO AREAS THAT COULD BE MADE HABITABLE. WE HAVE CLARIFIED THAT TO IT INCLUDES ALL SQUARE FOOTAGE, EXCEPT FOR
01:15:30.287: >> IT MAY NOT BE A REQUIREMENT, BUT I REQUESTED IT IN THE PLANNING COMMENTS AND A CONNECTION. SO YOU COULD THAT VERSE THROUGH THE SITE -- TRAVERSE THE SITE. THE PETITIONER DID RESPOND.
01:15:41.566: >> BUT TO BE CLEAR, IT'S NOT REQUIRED? I MEAN, YOU REQUESTED, IT IT WAS PROVIDED, DOES OUR CODE NEED TO CHANGE TO MAKE THAT A REQUIREMENT?
01:15:51.242: >> NO, I WOULD HAVE TO DOUBLE CHECK. I WOULD THINK THEY WOULD WANT SIDEWALKS AND THE ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT WOULD REQUEST SIDEWALKS THROUGHOUT THE SITE.
01:15:58.916: >> OKAY. I WANTED TO PUT THAT -- ANOTHER CLARIFICATION FROM WHAT CAME UP IN THE COMMENTS OR THE QUESTIONS. SO THE SANITARY SEWAGE, THAT IS -- MY UNDERSTANDING IT IS NOT -- THERE A ENOUGH CAPACITY TO HANDLE WHAT THE SITE IS PRODUCING; IS THAT CORRECT?
01:16:48.266: >> YES, I JUST LOOKED UP THE PREVIOUS SANITARY SEWER AND I BELIEVE THE UTILITIES ARE ADEQUATE TO ACCOMMODATE THE PROPOSAL.
01:16:54.172: >> OKAY. OKAY. THAT WAS ONE PIECE. AND THEN IN TERMS OF WHAT WE REQUIRE, IN TERMS OF MITIGATION -- MAYBE I WILL FOLLOW UP WITH THAT LATER. OKAY.
01:17:10.321: >> Chair Milshteyn: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COMMISSIONER SAUVE?
01:17:18.896: >> Commissioner Sauve: ONE MORE FOLLOW-UP WITH THE BASEMENTS. THE GRADIENTS AT LEAST ON THE EASTERN SIDE OF THE PROPERTY, ARE THE CENTER-CONNECTED UNITS ALSO WALKOUTS? I'M LOOKING AT THE SITE CONNECTION. IT LOOKS LIKE THEY MIGHT -- JUST TO UNDERSTAND THE CAPACITY OF SOME OF THOSE.
01:17:37.648: >> YES, THERE'S NOT A WALKOUT UNIT LIKE YOU WOULD THINK, OUT IN THE CENTER AND ALONG THAT NORTHEASTERN EDGE IN ORDER FOR US TO BASICALLY MEET THE GRADES THAT EXIST EITHER TO PRESERVE THE TREES AT THE EDGE OR THE TREES AT THE CENTRAL LOCATION OF THE SITE.
01:17:57.401: >> Commissioner Sauve: WALK ME THROUGH THAT AGAIN. ONE LINEAR LINE FROM THE CONNECTED UNITS AND THE EASTERN LINE OF --
01:18:05.543: >> YEP, SO THE CENTRAL BOX OR THE CONNECTED UNITS IF YOU WERE STANDING AT THE SIDEWALKS AT THE ROADWAY, YOU WOULD SLIGHTLY RISE TO THE FRONT DOOR OF THE UNIT. YOU WOULD GO INTO THE UNIT. THAT FIRST FLOOR, IS ROUGHLY 3 TO 4 FEET ABOVE THE GRADE BEHIND THE UNIT AND YOU HAVE THE EXPOSED BASEMENT FOUNDATION THERE. AND THE REASON TO DO THAT IS TO GET THAT GRADE TO DROP IN THAT AREA TO PRESERVE THE TREES THAT EXIST CENTRAL TO THAT. BLOCK. AND ON THE EASTERN SIDE -- YOU ARE TALKING ON THE NORTHEAST SIDE. WE DROP DOWN TO THE EXISTING GRADE BECAUSE THAT NORTHEAST CORNER IS A LOWER POINT.
01:18:47.818: >> Commissioner Sauve: AND THEN FROM THE BUILDING STANDPOINT IS THERE INTENDED FOR EGRESS WINDOWS OR ANY SORT OF WINDOWS IN THE BASEMENT FOUNDATIONS OTHER THAN THE TYPICAL TRANSOM?
01:18:59.730: >> OUR INTENT WAS TO MAKE THE BASEMENT, YOU KNOW, A NORMAL 8-FOOT, WHICH IS KIND OF A TYPICAL BASEMENT. WE -- IF WE DO THAT, WE ARE REQUIRED BY THE BUILDING CODE TO PUT AN EGRESS WINDOW IN. SO YES, THERE WOULD BE. HOWEVER, WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE WHOLE REASON WHY AND WE COULD PROBABLY HAVE A LONG DISCUSSION ON IT. THE BASEMENTS, I WANT THEM FOR STORAGE. AND I THINK EVERYONE LOSES SIGHT OF THE FACT THAT YOU ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO FINISH THE BASEMENT WITHOUT A PERMIT. I MEAN, THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE A BUILDING DEPARTMENT FOR. AND WE'RE PUTTING IT RIGHT IN THE ACTUAL DOCUMENTS THAT YOU CANNOT FINISH THEM. THEY KNOW THAT RIGHT UP FRONT. SO IT'S NOT THAT OH, GEE, I HAVE SOMETHING THAT MAYBE COULD BE TURNED INTO A HABITABLE SPACE. IT'S RIGHT IN THERE THAT THEY CAN'T. THE OTHER IS WE MAKE IT 8 FEET -- OR 7 FEET 5 INCHES AND THEN IT CAN'T BE FINISHED AND THEN IT'S JUST THE WORLD'S CATALLEST CRAWL. IT'S JUST BEING MORE CONVENTIONAL TRYING TO BE UP FRONT. SO PEOPLE HAVE A GOOD STORAGE SPACE BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE STUFF AND RATHER THAN SET IT OUTSIDE OR FILL THEIR GARAGE AND HAVE THE CAR SET OUT AND PEOPLE COMPLAIN -- BECAUSE I'M TRYING TO GET PEOPLE STORAGE IN A 2,000 SQUARE FOOT HOUSE. BECAUSE IT COSTS ABOUT THE SAME WHETHER I MAKE IT USABLE FOR SOSTORAGE OR NOT.
01:20:25.149: >> Commissioner Sauve: THAT'S PART OF THE CONVERSATION, IF YOU HAD A 1,000 SQUARE FOOTPRINT, 3,000 WOULD BE THE BASEMENT FINISHING AND WHAT AREA READING IN THE LANGUAGE RIGHT NOW -- CHRIS, CAN YOU CLARIFY? THAT THE BASEMENT IS COUNTED AS SQUARE FOOTAGE BUT IT'S ALLOWED TO GO ABOVE 2,000 GENTLEMAN IRRELEVANT FEET AND WHAT I'M HEARING FROM YOU THE LANGUAGE -- SQUARE FEET, AND WHAT I'M HEARING FROM YOU, THE LANGUAGE IS SA SAYING THE BASEMT CAN'T BE FINISHED. SOWFS YOU ARE OPEN TO THAT AS THE CONDITION IN THE LANGUAGE, THAT THE BASEMENTS CANNOT BE FINISHED.
01:21:00.184: >> THAT'S CORRECT. WE PROPOSED THAT AND WE PUT IT RIGHT THERE.
01:21:05.222: >> Commissioner Sauve: BUT PER HOW THE CITY PUTS IT --
01:21:08.325: >> FROM STAFF PERSPECTIVE. YES, THEY WOULD HAVE TO COME IN FOR A BUILDING PERMIT. THEN WE GET OURSELVES INTO ENFORCEMENT, OKAY THEY FINISHED A BASEMENT. STAFF WILL HAVE TO ENFORCE ON A FINISHED BASEMENT. I DID HAVE A BRIEF DISCUSSION WITH OUR ASSESSOR'S OFFICE. THEY DO NOT COUNT ANYTHING ABOVE THE BASEMENT AS PART OF THEIR FLOOR AREA. THEY ASSESS FOR A FINISHED BASEMENT BUT THEY DON'T COUNT IT IN THEIR CALCULATIONS. SO STAFF THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE EASIER AT LEAST IN THE FUTURE FOR A BUILDING DEPARTMENT, PLANNING DEPARTMENT, ZONING ENFORCEMENT TO ALLOW THOSE FINISHED BASEMENTS, YOU KNOW, I JUST DON'T KNOW IF WE CAN ENFORCE OR IF OUR BUILDING DEPARTMENT WILL RECALL. THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO PUT A HOLD AND DENY ANY TYPE OF FINISHED BASEMENT PERMIT THAT COMES IN.
01:21:54.538: >> Commissioner Sauve: BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE PART OF THE HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION, THAT LANGUAGE SAYS YOU CANNOT FINISH THE BASEMENT. AND IF A BUILDING PERMIT DID COME IN -- IT'S ALWAYS AN ENFORCEMENT CONDITION. IF A PERMIT DID COME IN, IT WOULD HAVE TO GO THROUGH ZONING COMPLIANCE REVIEW.
01:22:09.053: >> THAT'S CORRECT.
01:22:09.820: >> Commissioner Sauve: IT WOULD LOOK AT THE PUD AND UNDERSTAND THAT THE PERMIT WOULD GET DENIED.
01:22:14.725: >> IF THEY WENT THROUGH THE OFFICIAL CHANNELS OF.
01:22:17.962: >> Commissioner Sauve: WHICH IN ALL OF THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, IT ONLY HAPPENS WHEN THERE'S A COMPLAINT SORT OF CIRCUMSTANCE.
01:22:24.268: >> RIGHT.
01:22:24.702: >> Commissioner Sauve: SO IF THAT LANGUAGE IS TRUE AND WE ARE TRYING TO HOLD TO A CERTAIN SQUARE FOOTAGE INTENSITY, I ACTUALLY FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE THAT THE LANGUAGE IS IN THERE TO CATCH IT, IF YOU GO THROUGH THE PROPER CHANNELS. I THINK IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES, THE CITY PEOPLE CAN FIND ALTERNATIVE WAYS AND WE CAN ONLY ENFORCE WHAT WE KNOW. OKAY. THAT HELPS A LITTLE.
01:22:48.692: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONE.
01:22:50.094: >> Vice Chair Mills: , STAFF, WE TO HAVE R1E, ANOTHER R1E DISTRICT ON THE NORTH SIDE OF TOWN. DOES THAT INCLUDE BASEMENTS?
01:23:02.473: >> Planning Manager:  IT DOES. THAT WAS UNDER THE PREVIOUS DDEFINITION OF HABITABLE SPACE. THEY CONSTRUCTED BASEMENTS THAT EXCEEDED THE 2,000 SQUARE FEET. AND WE HAD NUMEROUS REQUESTS FOR PEOPLE TO FINISH THOSE BASEMENTS AND IT'S BEEN A CHALLENGE ON HOW TO RESPOND TO THAT. SO WHAT WE HAVE -- AS YOU HEARD THE PETITIONER REFER TO IT, THEY ARE FINISHING MANY OF THOSE BASEMENTS WITH A SHORTER CEILING HEIGHT THAT MAKES IT ILLEGAL TO FINISH THOSE BASEMENTS IN THE FUTURE. IT'S A MESSY EXAMPLE OF WHAT -- HOW WE ARE TRYING TO CLARIFY THE LANGUAGE IN THIS CIRCUMSTANCE.
01:23:46.951: >> Vice Chair Mills: CAN -- CAN YOU RECALL -- I DON'T KNOW THAT -- I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE WAS ANYBODY ON THIS TABLE THAT WAS AROUND WHEN WE ESTABLISHED THE R1E DISTRICT. OH! YES! OUR CHAIR! SEE! ABOUT WHAT THE -- WHAT THE INTENTION WAS.
01:24:10.040: >> Chair Milshteyn: THE INTENTION AT THAT TIME -- I CAN'T REMEMBER HAVING THE CONVERSATION ABOUT BASEMENTS. I ACTUALLY DON'T THINK IT EVER CAME UP. AND MY THINKING BEHIND IT WAS LIKE IT WAS LIKE ANY OTHER DISTRICT THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO FINISH THEIR BASEMENTS. I THINK ULTIMATELY THE GOAL WAS TO GET SMALLER TO -- TO GET SMALLER HOMES BUILT. SMALLER UNITS TO BE BUILT. WHETHER A BASEMENT WAS FINISHED OR NOT, I DON'T THINK IT EVER CAME UP. THIS IS FIRST I HAVE BEEN HEARING ABOUT THIS CONVERSATION. AND NOW BECAUSE I HAVE SOLD SEVERAL OF THE PROPERTIES ON PONTIAC AT NORTH SKY, THAT MAKES A WHOLE LOT MORE SENSE AS TO WHY THEY ARE BUILDING THEM THE WAY THEY ARE. BUT I -- I DON'T REMEMBER EVER RECALLING THAT CONVERSATION. I THINK WE JUST TREATED IT LIKE EVERY OTHER ZONING DISTRICT.
01:25:02.126: >> Vice Chair Mills: GOT IT. SO WHAT I SEE, RIGHT, IS THAT THERE IS A TENSION BETWEEN THE PUBLIC BENEFITS AND WHAT'S THE RISK OF LEAVING IT AS IT IS. RIGHT? VERSUS WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF THE PUD. AND YOU GOT -- I CAN PLAY IT OUT OR -- OR I CAN DEFER TO STAFF, WHO I'M SURE HAS GRAPPLED WITH THIS TO SOME EXTENT, LIKE -- BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO WEIGH IN MY MIND. THERE ARE THE -- THERE ARE THE BENEFITS OF THIS PUD IN TERMS OF THE STORMWATER DETENTION, RETENTION, ESPECIALLY FROM THE OFFSITE REQUIREMENT THAT AS ABOVE AND BEYOND AND THERE'S NATURAL AREA PRESERVATION BENEFITS. RIGHT? IT'S THE SAME NUMBER OF UNITS IN EITHER SITUATION. THERE ARE -- THERE'S THE BENEFIT OF HAVING A DIFFERENT HOUSINGPRODUCT HERE IN TERMS OF THE DUPLEXES OR THE ATTACHED UNITS THAT WE COULDN'T DO IN THE R1E UNDERLYING, BUT AT LEAST AS DEVELOPER -- THERE'S GOT TO BE A PRICE DIFFERENTIAL IN FINISHING YOUR BASEMENT OR NOT. IN THE EXISTING R1E, PARTICULARLY FOR THOSE HOUSES AT THE PERIMETER, RIGHT, NO WOULD BE MORE AFFORDABLE UNITS BECAUSE YOU COULD NOT FINISH THE BASEMENT UNDER THE CURRENT ORDINANCE. I WHAT. TO SHARE WITH, LIKE, THE PEOPLE LISTENING ON TV AND THE PEOPLE HERE. THERE ARE ALL OF THESE TRADEOFFS IN THIS AND I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT THE RIGHT ONE IS, BUT THESE ARE THE KIND OF THINGS, LUCKY US, THAT WE GET TO GRAPPLE WITH US ON A REGULAR BASIS. SO I WILL SHUT UP. I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE BASEMENT THING, JUST BECAUSE, AGAIN, IT POTENTIALLY 3,000 SQUARE FOOT -- WELL, NO. YOU CAN SAY THAT YOU CONDITION CAN'TFINISH IT. IF YOU CAN BUILD IT TO THE HEIGHT WHERE PEOPLE MIGHT -- LIKE, I DON'T KNOW HOW TO THINK ABOUT THIS.
01:27:02.846: >> Chair Milshteyn: TO ADD A LITTLE BIT OF MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE, I WOULD ESTIMATE THAT 75% OF THE PEOPLE WHO FINISH THEIR BASEMENTS, WHETHER THEY HIRE A CONTRACTOR OR THEY DO IT THEMSELVES. NOT PULL A PERMIT. -- THEMSELVES WILL NOT PULL A PERMIT. SORRY, MR. TH LENART. WHEN I LOOK AT THE BUILDING PERMITS THAT ARE PULLED. I'M PLEASANTLY SURPRISED WHEN ONE IS PULLED. THAT'S -- IT'S A SURPRISE TO ME WHEN ONE IS PULLED.
01:27:31.308: >> Planning Manager: ADDRESSED, MR. MILSHTEYN.
01:27:35.379: >> Chair Milshteyn: NO. SO EVEN THOUGH MR. HEISLER SAYS THIS WILL BE IN THE ASSOCIATION BYLAWS AND THE CITY WON'T ISSUE PERMITS, THOSE BASEMENTS, SOME OF THOSE BASEMENTS WILL BE FINISHED. AND I CAN TOTALLY UNDERSTAND THE STAFF'S PERSPECTIVE. THEY ARE STARTED TO FINISH THEIR BASEMENT. HOW DO WE ENFORCE IT? I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION. MS. MILLS.
01:28:07.878: >> Vice Chair Mills: SO THE SOLUTION IS TO SAY THAT THE WAY WE IDENTIFY SQUARE FOOTAGE, WHICH INCLUDES ALL OF THE FLOORS, INCLUDING THE BASEMENT, RIGHT, YOU CAN'T EXCEED THAT? RIGHT, THAT'S THE -- WHAT THIS ALSO MEANS IS THAT THESE PEOPLE CAN'T PUT AN ADDITION ON TO THEIR HOUSE. IF THEY MAX OUT AT 2,000 FEET, RIGHT, THEY CAN'T ADD A SUN ROOM IN THE BACK, RIGHT? BUT, AGAIN, THOUGH, ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF THE -- THE BENEFIT OF THE R1E IS TO HAVE REASONABLY SIZED HOMES SAYS THE WOMAN WHO LIVES IN 1300 SQUARE FEET. RIGHT? A SMALLISH FOOTPRINT HOUSE. AND SO THAT'S TRICKY.
01:28:51.488: >> AS FAR AS HOW YOU ENFORCE IT IF, THEY DID, IT IT'S RIGHT IN THE BYLAWS THAT THEY HAVE TO REMOVE IT IF THEY FINISH A BASEMENT AND THE ASSOCIATION BY STATE STATUTE HAS ASSESSMENT POWERS AND THAT THEY WILL ASSESS AGAINST A HOMEOWNER TO REMOVE IT. I MEAN, IT'S RIGHT IN THERE. THAT'S WHAT I PLANNED ON DOING. I DIDN'T PLAN ON MAKING IT A PROBLEM FOR EVERYONE ELSE. IT'S -- IT'S RIGHT THERE. IT'S LAW. BASICALLY. YOU KNOW, IT'S STATUTE. HERE IT IS. HERE'S THE BYLAWS. WE MAKE THEM. WE HAVE TO LIVE WITH THAT AND THE PEOPLE BUY IT, THEY KNOW IT. WILL IT DECREASE THE VALUE OF IT SOME? YEAH. BUT I WANT -- I THINK WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT HOW PEOPLE LIVE AND HAVE THE STORAGE. FOR ALL THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT KIDS HAVE. YOU DON'T WANT THE PLAY SETS SETTING OUT AND THE LIL TYKE THINGS, YOU WANT THEM INSIDE DOWNSTAIRS WHERE THE KIDS HAVE SOME ACTIVITY. THAT'S WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR. NOT LIVABLE SPACE. I'M WILLING TO I CAN MA THE ACCOMMODATION -- TO MAKE THE ACCOMMODATIONS NOT ON THE CITY TO DO.
01:30:02.693: >> Chair Milshteyn: MR. LENART? COMMISSIONER SAUVE.
01:30:04.227: >> Commissioner Sauve: I WILL JUST -- WE HAVE SEEN THESE HOUSING TYPOLOGIES BEFORE PRESENTED TO US, AND WITH THAT SQUARE FOOTAGE CAP, FINISHING THE BASEMENT OR NOT, IT'S PROTECTING THE SCALE THAT WE ARE SEEING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. THERE'S ALSO KIND OF -- WITHIN THE PUD, THE SINGLE -- THE SINGLE STORY HOMES LINING PART OF THE OUTSIDE PERIMETER, AS PART OF IT. SO THERE IS KIND OF SOME TIERED SCALE WITHIN THIS PROPERTY THAT I FIND A GOOD BALANCE. AND THAT THERE IS KIND OF A DISTRIBUTION OF DIFFERENT HOME TYPOLOGIES. WE HAVE THE TWO-STORY, THE ONE-STORY AND THE CONNECTED. AND SO I'M NOT -- I WANT TO GET CLARIFYING QUESTIONS ABOUT THE BASEMENTS JUST TO KIND OF KNOW THE CIRCUMSTANCE BUT I'M NOT CONCERNED ABOUT THE BASEMENT AS THE CONDITION OF THIS PUD LOSING A BENEFIT. I THINK THE NATURAL FEATURES IS THE BENEFIT AND THE PROGRESS THAT IT'S MADE IS THE SUBSTANTIAL PART. AND I THINK SINGLE -- YOU KNOW, SINGLE STORY, TWO-STORY AND ATTACHED IS A GREAT DIVERSITY WITHIN THIS DEVELOPMENT THAT CAN, YOU KNOW, PUT A LOT OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE TOGETHER TOO. SO IT'S INTERESTING TO HEAR, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S COMING FOR THE FUTURE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THESE ZONING AREAS BUT FOR THIS ONE, I FEEL COMFORTABLE, YOU KNOW, WITH HOW THE BASEMENT CIRCUMSTANCE IS GOING TO PLAY OUT.
01:31:29.446: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONE R HAMMERSCHMIDT.
01:31:37.821: >> Commissioner HAMMERSCHMIDT:  THANK YOU. SO CLEARLY I WAS NEAR FOR ANY OF THE PREVIOUS DISCUSSIONS OF THIS PROJECT. SO I'M TRYING REALLY HARD TO COME UP TO SPEED AND I JUST KEEP THINKING ABOUT WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE TO LIVE HERE, ESPECIALLY I HAVE SMALL CHILDREN, AND THE ONLY ENTRANCE POINT IS ON PACKARD ROAD. I GUESS I'M ALSO THINKING THIS IS PROPOSED TO BE A PUD AND THERE SHOULD BE A PUBLIC BENEFIT. ARE THERE OTHER PUBLIC BENEFITS THAT WE'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT. I'M ALSO NOT A LANDSCAPE ARCHITECT. THE STORMWATER RETENTION PONDS CAN THEY BECOME SOME SORT OF USABLE PARK SPACE? HAVE YOU HAD NO THOSE DISCUSSIONS OR ANY SORT OF -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PARK SPACE, IF THERE'S ANY PARK SPACE DEDICATION.
01:32:27.304: >> I DON'T HAVE CONTROLS, I WOULD TOGGLE DOWN. THERE IS OPEN SPACE ON SITE. IF MR. COVERT COULD TOGGLE TO A COUPLE OF SLIDES.
01:32:39.449: >> Commissioner HAMMERSCHMIDT:  THEY JUST LOOK LIKE TREES TO ME.
01:32:43.019: >> SO THE BEST SIDE OF THE SITE. THE CENTRAL WEST SIDE AND THERE'S A CONNECTING PATH BUT UP IN THE -- KIND OF -- IS IT SOUTH, SOUTHEAST CORNER ALSO.
01:32:55.732: >> Commissioner HAMMERSCHMIDT:  THERE'S NOTHING TO THE SURROUNDING NEIGHBORHOODS. IS IT POSSIBLE TO MAKE CONNECTIONS TO THE SURROUNDING NEIGHBORHOODS? I'M STRUGGLING WITH THE INSULARITY OF THIS. TO ACCESS BURR PARK YOU HAVE TO GO OUT. I'M THINKING ABOUT LIVING HERE AND PUSHING A STROLLER DOWN PACKARD AND THE SIDEWALKS DONE T LOOK GREAT.
01:33:23.059: >> Planning Manager:  FROM THE STAFF PE PERSPECTIVE, I THIK IT CAME UP IN THE -- MAYBE EVEN THE AREA PLAN, I'M NOT SURE, BUT I THINK THE QUESTION WAS RAISED, I THINK THE PETITIONER HAD REFERENCED THE BARRIERS BECAUSE IT WAS SURROUNDED BY INDIVIDUAL LOTS. THERE'S NO PUBLIC EASEMENTS OR RIGHT-OF-WAYS. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAD ANY FURTHER INVESTIGATION.
01:33:47.017: >> SO WE HAVE A COUPLE OF AREAS THAT DON'T INCUMBER SITE, AND UP BY THE ENTRANCEWAY. WE DO HAVE WALKS SURROUNDING ON EACH SIDE OF THE PRIVATE ROADWAYS. THEY ARE NOT PUBLIC ROADWAYS, THEY ARE PRIVATE ROADWAYS. SO I'M NOT CERTAIN THAT THE ORDINANCE STATES THAT YOU HAVE WALKS ON BOTH SIDES. WE HAVE THOSE. WE HAVE A WALK THAT BISECTS THE CENTRAL PART. IT CAME UP WITH THE PREVIOUS PLANS, THE AREA PLAN, THE SITE PLAN THAT WAS ULTIMATELY DENIED AND THIS PLAN TO WORK TO TRY TO ACHIEVE AN EASEMENT ON ONE OF THE PRIVATE PROPERTIES ADJACENT TO THE SITE SO THERE COULD BE CUT THROUGHS TO THE NEIGHBORHOODS. WE HAVEN'T HAD ANYBODY COME FORTH AND MENTION IT. WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT IT AT MANY MEETINGS WHEN WE HAD OUR CITIZEN PARTICIPATION MEETINGS AND SO ON, BUT N NOBODY HAS COME FORTH WITH THAT. WE DID HEAR AT CITIZEN PARTICIPATION MEETINGS THAT THERE WAS A CONCERN WITH SCHOOL-AGED CHILDREN WALKING THROUGH THE NEIGHBORS' YARDS WHERE WE NOTED THERE ARE EXISTING FENCES THAT WOULD PROHIBIT THAT PERCEIVED NUANCE. AS FAR AS USING STORMWATER DETENTION FOR PARKLAND AREA, BECAUSE THIS IS A DRAINAGE DISTRICT, THE COUNTY HAS SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS AND EASEMENTS THAT WILL INCUMBER THOSE AREAS THAT WILL PROHIBIT MANY THINGS AND IT ALSO KIND OF DICTATES WHERE THE LANDSCAPE PLANTINGS HAVE TO BE AND SO ON TOO.
01:35:13.370: >> Commissioner HAMMERSCHMIDT:  THANK YOU.
01:35:14.404: >> ONE OTHER THING I WILL MENTION, PART OF THE PROJECT, WESTERLY PROMOTING THE PARKLAND CONTRIBUTION AS WELL.
01:35:24.381: >> Chair Milshteyn: FURTHER DISCUSSION? MR. COVERT, I HAVE A QUICK QUESTION OR ACTUALLY MAYBE IT'S NOT SO QUICK. CAN YOU -- JUST BECAUSE WE HAVE TALKED QUITE A BIT. CAN YOU GO THROUGH AND JUST GIVE US BULLET POINTS OF ALL THE PUBLIC BENEFITS OF THIS SITE? I DON'T NEED FULL EXPLANATIONS. I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I'M NOT FORGETTING ANY OF THEM.
01:35:50.907: >> YEP. SO THE PUD BENEFITS, THE PUB PUC BENEFITS, WE WERE IDENTIFYING AS DIVERSE HOUSING TYPOLOGY WITH THE ATTACHED UNITS AND LIMITED DENSITY AND THE SINGLE FAMILY HOMES. WE WERE LOOKING AT THE NATURAL FEATURES PREEVERYBODY IS -- PRESERVATION, AND THE STORMWATER MANAGEMENT, AS EXCEEDING THE REQUIREMENTS AND ADDRESSING HISTORICAL FLOODING ISSUES.
01:36:20.470: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU. FURTHER DISCUSSION? ARE WE READY FOR A VOTE? ALL RIGHT. IT LOOKS LIKE WE ARE. LET'S DO A ROLL CALL VOTE. MR. LENART.
01:36:46.463: >> Planning Manager:  SO THE MOTION IS AS PRESENTED IN THE STAFF REPORT WITH THE ADDED CONDITION THAT THE HOUSE ON THE -- THE HISTORIC HOUSE ON THE PROPERTY REMAIN ON SITE UNTIL AGREEDING PERMIT IS ISSUED TO PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MOVING THE HOUSE AND/OR OTHER PRESERVATION EFFORTS.
01:37:06.316: >> Chair Milshteyn: IT'S BOTH OF THE MOTIONS THAT WE HAVE BEFORE US.
01:37:08.885: >> Planning Manager:  YEP.
01:37:15.458: >> Chair Milshteyn: YES.
01:37:15.992: >> Vice Chair Mills: YES.
01:37:16.559: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall:  YES.
01:37:19.029: >> Commissioner Abrons:  YES.
01:37:21.097: >> Councilmember Ackerman: NO.
01:37:26.336: >> Commissioner Briggs: YES.
01:37:28.004: >> Commissioner HAMMERSCHMIDT:  YES.
01:37:30.907: >> Commissioner Sauve: YES.
01:37:31.508: >> Planning Manager:  THE MOTION CARRIES.
01:37:33.176: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. MOVING ON TO REGULAR BUSINESS. THE FIRST ITEM ON OUR AGENDA IS 10-A, SHELL STATION PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT MODIFICATIONS FOR CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL. WE WILL START WITH THE PETITIONER PRESENTATION. YOU WILL HAVE TEN MINUTES TO PRESENT. WE WILL THEN MOVE ON TO STAFF REPORT, PUBLIC HEARING AND THEN DISCUSSION.
01:38:01.304: >> I'M TODD QUATTRO WITH QUATTRO CONSTRUCTION. THE DESIGNER. SO THE PROPOSED PROPOSITION IS TO ADD ON TO THE A -- ADD AN ADDITION ON TO EXISTING STATION THAT'S SITTING AT ANN ARBOR SALINE ROAD AND EISENHOWER, RIGHT AT THE VERY BEGINNING. THE EXISTING BUILDING WAS BUILT IN '96, I THINK IS WHEN WE ORIGINALLY BUILT AND THEN MODIFIED A FEW YEARS AGO WHEN THEY PUT TIM HORTON'S ON. THEY HAD THE APPROVAL OF A PUD BACK THEN AND DID SOME PUBLIC BENEFIT. THE AREA WE ARE GOING TO ADD ON TO IS TO THE SOUTH OF THE BUILDING AND WE ARE GOING TO -- WE PROPOSED TO ENCLOSE THE OPEN DETENTION POND, AND -- AND UNDERGROUND STORMWATER DETENTION ALONG WITH THE TREATMENT FACILITY. THE PROPOSED ADDITION IS ABOUT 4,712 AND THERE WILL BE AN OFFICE SITUATED ON THE TOP OF THE BUILDING FOR A SECOND STORY, WITH A -- FOR THE OWNER. JUST SIMPLY FOR HIM TO SIT UP THERE AND THERE'S GOING TO BE 720-FOOT OF ADDITIONAL STORAGE ADDED FOR THE GAS STATION. HE'S HAVING A LITTLE TROUBLE RIGHT THERE, YEAH, WITH STORAGE AT THE MOMENT. IT'S GETTING A LITTLE INSIDE THE STORE AS FAR AS THAT GOES. WE HAD A COUPLE OF CITIZEN PARTICIPATION MEETINGS, AND WE HAD SOME SUGGESTIONS COME UP FROM THE NEIGHBOR, CRANBROOK TO THE SOUTH, I BELIEVE THEY PROVIDED A LETTER STIPULATING SUCH. PRESENTLY, THERE ARE 26 SPACES, 20 ARE REQUIRED. THEY ARE SIX OVER THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENT. WE ARE GOING TO CONSTRUCT OVER -- LET ME BACK UP. OVER THE ONE AREA, RIGHT HERE, THERE'S EIGHT SPACES, EIGHT CAR SPACES THERE. AND WE ARE GOING TO -- AND WE'RE GOING TO CREATE 14 NEW SPACES, AND THAT WOULD BE BY ENCLOSING THE DETENTION FACILITY -- THE DETENTION POND OVER AT THE CORNER. WE WILL MODIFY THE AREA. WE ARE PUTTING IN SOME ADDITIONAL LAND -- LANDSCAPING. WE GOT ADDITIONAL RIGHT-OF-WAY TREES AND STREET TREES. TWO ADDITIONAL STREET TREES. BIO RETENTION IN THE AREA AND WE ARE PROVIDING SOME PEDESTRIAN WALKWAY UP TO THE AREA. SO WE ARE ENCLOSING EIGHT AND WE ARE -- WE ARE -- EXCUSE ME. ONE SECOND. AND WE ARE CREATING 21 NEW SPACES. THE NEW DEVELOPMENT CALLS OUT FOR 14 SPACES OF WHICH WE CALCULATED ALL RETAIL. THERE IS 800 SQUARE FEET THAT WILL BE DESIGNATED TO THE OWNER FOR HIS STORAGE IN THE BACK OF THE BUILDING. THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT.
01:41:34.717: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND WE WILL GO OVER TO MR. CHENG FOR A STAFF REPORT.
01:41:38.154: >> YES, JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT. WE DO ALSO FOR THE PARKING COUNTS, WE COUNT THE PUMP STATION. SO THEY HAVE GOT SOME PUMP STATIONS THERE THAT -- WE HAVE COUNTED 12 ADDITIONAL PARKING SPACES. SO THE PUMPS COUNT AS FAR AS THE PARKING GOES:  IT DOES MEET WITH THE PREVIOUSLY APPROVED SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS, AS FAR AS AREA HEIGHT, PARKING REGULATIONS, SO THERE WERE NO CHANGES TO THE SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS. THEY ARE ALSO REQUESTING A LANDSCAPE MODIFICATION TO SCREEN THE PROPOSED NEW PARKING LOT. FUEL STATIONS ARE A LITTLE DIFFERENT. THEY REQUIRE 15 FEET WIDTH WITH A 30-INCH WALL. A TYPICAL RIGHT-OF-WAY SCREENING REQUIRES 10 FEET, AND A 30-INCH TYPE OF HEDGE BERM OR WALL AND THEY ARE MEETING THAT WITH 10 FEET AND A HEDGE BERM WALL. IT'S 30 INCHES FROM A LANDSCAPING PERSPECTIVE THAT DOES MEET THE SCREENING INTENT FROM THE RIGHT-OF-WAY TO THE PROPOSED PARKING LOT. AND I'M HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE.
01:42:38.948: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU. AT THIS TIME, I WOULD LIKE TO OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING, IF THERE ARE ANY MEMBERS IN THE AUDIENCE WHO WISH TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION. PLEASE STEP FORWARD AND STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS FOR THE RECORD. YOU HAVE UP TO THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
01:42:55.698: >> MY NAME IS ALEX DEKE AND I REPRESENT THE CRANBROOK SHOPPING CENTERS. I'M NORTHEAST OF THE SHELL STATION. WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS REGARDING THE APPLICATION. WHAT WE SEE ARE SOME INACCURACY AS THE TRAFFIC STUDY REPORT AND OMISSIONS WHICH WE THINK CONTRIBUTES TO SOME SAFETY CONCERNS RELATED TO TRAFFIC AND PARKING ON THE SITE. AS THE APPLICANT SAID, THEY ARE ADDING NEARLY 5,000 SQUARE FEET, AS AN ADDITION. IF YOU ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH, THIS IS ALREADY A VERY CONGESTED PARKING AREA. AND OUR MAIN CONCERN IS IN THE TRAFFIC STUDY, THEY DON'T MENTION -- FIRST, IT'S INACCURATE. IT SAYS IT'S ONLY 1500 SQUARE FOOT ADDITION. THIS IS MUCH LARGER. WE ANTICIPATE A LOT MORE USE, A LOT MORE TRAFFIC. AND IT ALSO DOESN'T MENTION THE TIM HORTON'S DRIVE THRU RESTAURANT AND WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THESE THINGS WERE NOT PROPERLY ACCOUNTED FOR. AND THAT THE PARKING SPACES -- AND I KNOW CHRIS MENTIONED, SOME OF THEM ARE THE GAS PUMP LANES. NOTHING MENTIONED HOW THOSE LANES ARE GOING TO INTERACT. THOSE ARE GOING TO BE MOVING CARS AND NOT STATIONARY. WE ARE MISSING SOME DIMENSIONAL MEASUREMENTS IN THE PARKING LOT. IT'S HARD TO TELL ACTUALLY WHAT THE CAPACITY FOR PARKING IS HERE. THIS IS SOMETHING WE ARE JUST CONCERNED ABOUT SAFETY HERE IN AN ALREADY CONGESTED AREA AND A BIG ADDITION. RELATED TO THAT, AS I HAVE SAID CRANBROOK IS RELATED TO THE EAST SIDE. THERE'S A STEEP SLOPE LEADING UP TO THE SHELL STATION. I THINK THERE'S A CONCERN THAT IF THERE'S INADEQUATE PARKING ON THIS SITE, PEOPLE ARE GOING TO START PARKING ON THE CRANBROOK AND IT'S WALK UP THIS STEEP SLOPE. IT'S NOT PROVIDED FOR PEDESTRIAN CROSS TRAFFIC. AT A MINIMUM, WE ASK THAT A FENCE GOES UP. THAT WAS BROUGHT UP AT THE -- I THINK IT WAS BROUGHT UP AT THE CITIZEN PARTICIPATION MEETING. I THINK THE CONTRACTOR THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD IDEA. IT'S SOMETHING WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE ADDED AT A MINIMUM. RELATED TO THE SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS, AND KIND OF THIS PUD MODIFICATION APPROVAL, WE JUST DON'T THINK IT MEETS THE STANDARDS. AGAIN, THERE'S A LOT OF INACCURACIES AND MISSING INFORMATION IN THE TRAFFIC REPORT, THE SITE PLAN DOESN'T HAVE CERTAIN DIMENSIONAL REQUIREMENTS, AND WE JUST -- WE CAN'T GET A SENSE OF HOW THE CONGESTED PARKING IS GOING TO BE FIXED ON THIS SITE. AND I THINK THAT REALLY SHIFTS THE BURDEN TO NEIGHBORS, LIKE CRANBROOK NO HAVE TO DEAL WITH PEOPLE PARKING ON THEIR SITE AND POTENTIAL LIABILITY WITH THAT PEDESTRIAN CROSS TRAFFIC. SO WE DON'T THINK IT ACTUALLY MEETS THE PUD STANDARD OF REVIEW, WHICH REQUIRES, YOU KNOW, A SAFE ASSESSMENT OF PEDESTRIAN, VEHICULAR TRAFFIC, AND THE SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS FROM WHEN IT WAS APPROVED IN 2012 AS WELL. WE ASK THESE THINGS BE CONSIDERED A LITTLE BIT FURTHER. MAYBE A MORE DETAILED REPORT PROVIDED, ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES AND, AGAIN, AT A MINIMUM AT LEAST A FENCE BETWEEN THE TWO SITES.
01:45:58.014: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU.
01:46:02.685: >> THANKS.
01:46:07.089: >> GOOD EVENING. MY NAME IS MARK DRAIN, I'M AN ARCHITECT WITH ROGAVOY ARCHITECT. IT'S 32500, TELEGRAPH ROAD. I WAS ASKED TO REVIEW SET OF DRAWINGS ON BEHALF OF CRANBROOK I'M OPPOSED TO THIS DEVELOPMENT. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE APPLICANT HAS PROVIDED ALL THE INFORMATION THAT IS REQUIRED FOR BOTH THE STAFF, THE PLANNING COMMISSION, OR THE PUBLIC TO UNDERSTAND THE APPLICATION AND THE PROPOSAL. USUALLY WHEN -- I'M USUALLY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TABLE. I'M ALWAYS PUTTING THESE PLANS TOGETHER AND THE FIRST THING I DO IS I GO TO THE CHECK LIST. WHAT'S ON THE CHECK LIST, LET'S PROVIDE THAT. THEIR PROPOSALS DO NOT INCLUDE THE SURVEY AND THE EXISTING CONTOURS, THE DIMENSIONAL LAYOUT SPECIFICALLY WHERE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE PARKING SPACES AT THE PUMP. THERE'S 12 SPACES COUNTED AND THEY ARE NOT SHOWN AT THE PLAN. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE HOW THAT WORKS WITH DIMENSION. I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR EVERYBODY TO SEE THOSE. THERE'S NO PHOTOMETRIC PLAN. THAT WAS ON THE LIST. I DON'T SEE THAT. VERTICAL SECTIONS ON THE BUILDINGS AND PROSPECTIVE RENDERINGS AND DIMENSION FLOOR PLANS. I CAN'T EVEN CALCULATE THE SQUARE FOOTAGE OF THE FLOOR PLANS BECAUSE I DON'T BELIEVE THEY WERE DRAFTED CORRECTLY. THERE'S NO INDICATION OF OUTDOOR SALES. I KNOW YOU NEED PARKING ON THAT. THERE'S NO INDICATION ON THE PARKING THAT THERE'S A RESTAURANT ON THE SITE AND WE SHOULD BE CALCULATING THE PARKING FOR A RESTAURANT USE. THERE'S NO LOADING AREA PROVIDED. I DON'T WANT TRUCKS TO GO FROM -- BECAUSE THEY CAN'T GO TO A 24-HOUR GAS STATION, AND A TIM HORTON'S THAT OPEN FROM 6:00 IN THE MORNING TO 11:00 AT NIGHT. THERE'S NO PLACE TO LOAD. THEY ARE GOING TO LOAD AT CRANBROOK. I DON'T THINK THAT'S A SAFE SITUATION. WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE A DECORATIVE FENCE ALONG THE PROPERTY LINE BECAUSE THERE ARE DOORS THAT OPEN UP TO OUR PROPERTY LINE, AND WITHIN 5 FEET OF OUR PROPERTY LINE THERE'S A DOOR AND I DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO GO OUT THAT DOOR AND FALL DOWN THAT HILL. AND, AGAIN, THERE'S A LOT OF INFORMATION ON THE ELEVATIONS THAT AREN'T CORRECT. THERE'S, YOU KNOW, THE SCALES ARE WRONG. THE SCALES ARE WRONG. IT'S JUST NEEDS TO BE CLEANED UP AND ONCE WE SEE WHAT THE REAL PROPOSAL IS, THEN WE CAN ALL SEE AND, ENJOY, HOPEFULLY A NEW DEVELOPMENT, BUT UNTIL THEN, I DON'T THINK ANYBODY CAN MAKE THAT DECISION. THANK YOU.
01:48:37.440: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION IN REGARDS TO THIS PETITION? SEEING NO ONE, I WILL CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING, AND I WILL READ THE MOTION. THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION HEREBY RECOMMENDS THAT THE MAYOR AND THE CITY COUNCIL APPROVE THE SHELL GAS STATION PLAN UNIT DEVELOPMENT PUD SITE PLAN AND ASSOCIATED LANDSCAPE MODIFICATIONS. MOVED BY COMMISSIONER MILLS AND SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN. DISCUSSION? COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN?
01:49:08.270: >> Councilmember Ackerman: HERE I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO HAVE AN EASY ONE. [ LAUGHTER ] MR. CHENG AND MR. LENART, CAN YOU PLEASE SPEAK TO THE OBJECTIONS WE JUST HEARD, SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE COMPLETENESS OF THE APPLICATION?
01:49:22.418: >> WELL, I AM GOING THROUGH RIGHT NOW, JUST TRYING TO SCROLL THROUGH WHO SIGNED OFF. I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE TRAFFIC HAS SIGNED OFF, BUT I DO WANT TO DOUBLE CHECK AS FAR AS WHEREE THOSE NUMBERS CORRECT. I WILL CONTINUE THAT AS WE HAVE THE DISCUSSION. WE COULD PUT A FENCE ONE. THEY COULD PUT THAT UP OR IF THE CRANBROOK OWNERS PUT A FENCE UP. IT'S NOT A REQUIREMENT. I BELIEVE THERE ARE A COUPLE OF SLIDES THAT WOULD SHOW -- I DON'T KNOW IF HE HAS A POWERPOINT. HE SHOWED THE 12 SPACES. -- IT'S ALSO BROKEN DOWN ON THE ZONING CHART AGAIN. IT MAY NOT BE ON THIS ONE, BUT THERE'S A HYPERLINK, YOU COULD LOOK TO SEE --
01:50:03.793: >> YEAH.
01:50:04.059: >> YOU CAN BARELY CATCH IT OW HOWTHEY CAME UP WITH THE CAN CALCULATIONS, BREAKING IT DOWN BY OFFICE, AND RETAIL OUT THERE. AS FAR AS PARKING MINIMUMS, TRYING TO GO THROUGH WHAT THE OTHER -- I DON'T REMEMBER THOSE?
01:50:19.942: >> YES, I CAN PROBABLY HELP OUT A LITTLE BIT.
01:50:22.578: >> AND I WILL START LOOKING UP SOME INFORMATION.
01:50:24.446: >> THE INITIAL PUD WAS ALL APPROVED. WE'RE ADDING ON TO JUST -- JUST TO THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE AREA. SO WE JUST TOOK THAT PARTICULAR SIDE. SO THE TOPOGRAPHIC AND ALL THE DIMENSIONAL AND EVERYTHING ELSE WITH THE EXISTING PUMPS AND ALL THE PARKING, WE ARE ALL IN THE PREVIOUS APPLICATION, ALREADY REVIEWED THROUGH ENGINEERING, AND ALREADY REVIEWED FOR PLANNING AND ALREADY APPROVED. SO WE TOOK THIS AS JUST THE ADDITION AND PUT THE ADDITION ON THE OTHER SIDE. AND AFTER RECEIVING THROUGH THE CITIZEN PARTICIPATION MEETING, SOME OF THE CONCERNS, WE CAME BACK AND WE DID AS CHRIS JUST MENTIONED, WE WENT BACK THERE AND WE LA CALCULATED WITH THE RESTAURANT BECAUSE PREVIOUSLY IT WASN'T PUT ON AS A RESTAURANT. IT JUST HAD DRIVE THRU AND IT JUST HAD THE -- THE BILLING STATION AND RETAIL IS HOW THEY DID IT PREVIOUSLY. SO WE WENT BACK AND WE PUT THE RESTAURANT IN AT 680 FEET, AND CALCULATED THE SQUARE -- THAT REQUIRED FOUR SPACES. AND WE STILL IN EXCESS OF THREE SPACES -- OR FOUR SPACES OF WHAT THE TOTAL REQUIRED, IF WE USE BOTH. SO THERE WASN'T REALLY LACK OF INFORMATION. THE INFORMATION WAS JUST TARGETED TOWARDS THE AREA IN CONCERN, WHERE WE WERE WORKING.
01:51:50.266: >> Councilmember Ackerman: OKAY. AND THEN -- THANK YOU. AND THEN THE DIMENSIONS OF YOUR DRAWING WITHIN THE PARKING LOT, DO YOU WANT TO RESPOND TO THAT?
01:52:00.109: >> YOU WILL ATHE DIMENSIONS WERE CORRECT AND THEY WERE REVIEWED THROUGH ENGINEERING AND STAFF. EVERYBODY HAS BEEN THROUGH IT SEVERAL TIMES AND EVERYBODY IS VERY --
01:52:10.352: >> Councilmember Ackerman: DID YOU SUBMIT A PHOTOMETRIC PLAN?
01:52:13.622: >> NO, BECAUSE IT WAS AN EXISTING PHOTOMETRIC AND WE ARE NOT DOING ANY ADDITIONAL -- I SHOULDN'T SAY THAT.
01:52:20.462: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YEAH.
01:52:21.397: >> WE ARE GOING TO -- WE ARE GOING TO HAVE SOME LIGHTING ON THE ADDITIONAL BUILDING, BUT IT WAS DEEMED NEGLIGIBLE SO WE DIDN'T PROVIDE A NEW PHOTOMETRIC PLAN, THERE'S NO NEW LIGHT POLES BEING ADDED OR ANYTHING OF THAT NATURE.
01:52:39.481: >> Councilmember Ackerman: JUST SO YOU KNOW, WE ARE WORKING AS A CITY, TWO SEPARATE COMMISSIONS, REVISING OUR LIGHTING ORDINANCES AND WE ARE WORKING TOWARDS THE DARK SKY POLICY.
01:52:51.360: >> RIGHT.
01:52:51.660: >> Councilmember Ackerman: CAN YOU SPEAK TO WHETHER OR NOT YOUR LIGHTS WOULD BE COMPLIANT WITH THAT? IT WOULD BE GREAT IF WE CAN GET AHEAD --
01:52:58.400: >> I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE EXISTING CANOPY AS IT SITS NOW. THAT WAS CONSTRUCTED IN '9 #97 R SO. I'M NOT SURE IF IT WAS UPGRADED TO L.E.D. THE OWNER IS HERE. THEY DID CONFORM TO THAT, WHERE THEY WENT THROUGH AND RENOVATED THE CANOPY RECENTLY AND INSTALLED L.E.D. LIGHTING. AT THAT TIME THEY WOULD HAVE HAD TO BE IN COMPLIANCE ON THE CITY.
01:53:24.393: >> Councilmember Ackerman: SO ON THE PROPOSED 4700 SQUARE FEET, THE LIGHTING -- WHERE OUR CONCERNS WOULD BE IS LIKE A LOT OF -- MOST OF IT REVOLVES AROUND SHIELDING AND ORIENTATION OF THE LIGHT.
01:53:34.303: >> YEAH.
01:53:34.570: >> Councilmember Ackerman: WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO WORK WITH STAFF TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE SHIELDING APPROPRIATELY AND IN LINE WITH WHAT WE ARE HOPING TO DO AS A CITY.
01:53:42.978: >> YES, AND DOWN LIGHT ONLY.
01:53:44.380: >> Councilmember Ackerman:
01:53:45.214: >> LY RIGHT.T.
01:53:48.817: >> THAT'S TYPICAL OF WHAT WE ARE DOING.
01:53:51.553: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  I WOULD LIKE STAFF TO HELP WITH THAT. OH, THE FENCE.
01:54:00.929: >> THE FENCE IS IN THE BACK THERE AND RIGHT NOW THERE IS -- WENT OUT AND SHOT IT. THERE'S ABOUT A ONE ON FOUR GRADIENT GOING OFF THE BACK OF THE PROPERTY INTO THEIR -- THEIR THING. IT CAME UP IN OUR CITIZENS PARTICIPATION MEETING, WOULD WE BE WILLING TO DO THE FENCE. AS I PUT TO THE NEIGHBOR IS THE APPLICANT OR THE OWNER IS VERY AMENABLE TO ANY REASONABLE REQUEST. I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, AS FAR AS A 3-FOOT HIGH FENCE OR SOMETHING SMALL WAS, YOU KNOW, IT WAS SOMETHING THAT HE WOULD PROBABLY CONSIDER DOING. I BROUGHT IT BACK TO HIM AND THEN THEY SENT US A FENCE THAT THEY WANT THAT'S 6-FOOT HIGH AND WE DIDN'T WANT IT TO BE LIKE A TRASH COLLECTOR IN BETWEEN THE BUILDING AND THE FENCE. IN AN AREA WHERE JUST PEOPLE ARE -- BECAUSE WE GET A LOT OF CROSS TRAFFIC AND --
01:54:56.652: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THE UTILITY OF A 3-FOOT FENCE JUST TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM WALKING --
01:55:01.924: >> PARDON?
01:55:02.224: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THE UTILITY OF THE 3-FOOT FENCE IT IT'S NOT BL BLOCK ANY VIEWS.
01:55:10.265: >> I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE THERE -- THERE'S A LOT OF CROSS-FOOT TRAFFIC BETWEEN THE TWO PROPERTIES WHERE THEY COME OVER TO USE THE TIM HORTON'S AND THEY EAT AND VICE VERSA. PEOPLE ARE THERE PARKING AND GOING INTO WHOLE FOODS AND GRABBING THEIR FOOD AND DOING THINGS LIKE THAT. SO THERE'S THE -- THE OWNER WOULD RATHER NOT INSTALL A FENCE BECAUSE HE LIKES TO ENCOURAGE THAT TYPE OF TRAFFIC GOING BACK AND FORTH, ESPECIALLY ON BIG EVENTS AT THE STADIUM AND STUFF LIKE THAT, THERE'S A -- AS YOU KNOW, A LOT OF -- A LOT OF PEOPLE.
01:55:45.200: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YEAH.
01:55:46.301: >> PACKED INTO ONE AREA.
01:55:49.304: >> Councilmember Ackerman: OKAY. SO I'M HEARING MAYBE AMENABLE TO A 3-FOOT FENCE BUT NOT A 6-FOOT FENCE. I WILL LEAVE IT THERE FOR NOW FOR ME.
01:55:59.081: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONE R BRIGGS.
01:56:01.016: >> Commissioner Briggs: SO ON THE FENCE TOPIC, I DEFINITELY AGREE, I WOULD DEFINITELY NOT LIKE TO SEE A FENCE THERE.
01:56:09.458: >> RIGHT.
01:56:09.925: >> Commissioner Briggs: I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS OF CRANBROOK AND I DON'T CARE THEM. IF PEOPLE ARE GOING ACROSS THE -- THEY WANT TO TREK DOWN THE HILL, LOVELY! POWER TO THEM. I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE. I WOULD LOVE TO SEE A LITTLE SIDEWALK THERE IF WE ENCOURAGE ANYTHING ELSE. BUT I UNDERSTAND THE A.D. AXA. ISSUES ON THAT. MY BIGGER ISSUE IS UNDERSTANDING WHY THIS -- I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND BESIDES PEOPLE'S APPARENT LOVE FOR TIM HORTON WHAT THE PUBLIC BENEFIT WAS AROUND A PUD BACK IN 2014 AND HOW THIS INCREASED THE PROPOSAL -- IF THIS HAD ALL BEEN PUT TOGETHER AT THAT TIME AND THE COMMISSION WAS CONSIDERING THIS PROPOSAL AS IT EXISTS TODAY, I -- CAN YOU HELP ME BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT PUBLIC BENEFIT WAS SEEN THERE AND HOW THAT MIGHT COMPLIMENT IT OR NOT?
01:57:06.148: >> SO THIS WAS APPROVED APPROXIMATELY FIVE YEARS AGO AS A PUD, AND IT WAS MOSTLY A SERVICE STATION, AND IT IS AN ENTRY POINT INTO THE CITY. I DON'T HAVE A POINTER BUT IF YOU LOOK AT A COUPLE OF AREAS ON THE SITE, RIGHT AT THE CORNER, YOU CAN SEE THERE'S A PUBLIC MEETING AREA FOR THE PEDESTRIANS AND THERE'S ANOTHER PUBLIC MEETING AREA WHERE THE DRIVE THRU GOES IN. AND THEY ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO ACTUALLY USE CERTAIN TYPES OF BUILDING MATERIAL FOR THIS WILL FUEL STATION AS PART OF THE PUBLIC BENEFIT. THAT'S OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD. I WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK AND PULL THE SUPPLEMENTAL REGS.
01:57:40.649: >> AND THERE'S A PAVER WALK RIGHT HERE, CONNECTING TO THAT --
01:57:45.120: >> CORRECT.
01:57:47.189: >> INTERNAL PEDESTRIAN CONNECTIONS. BUT THOSE WERE OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD WHAT THE PUBLIC BENEFITS WERE FOR THE SHELL STATION.
01:57:54.663: >> Commissioner Briggs: SO WOULD THIS EXISTING SORT OF EXPANSION AND DEVELOPMENT, WOULD THAT HAVE BEEN -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ZONING WAS PREVIOUSLY. WOULD THIS HAVE BEEN SOMETHING THAT WAS PERMISSIBLE?
01:58:04.139: >> OH, IT WAS -- THE UNDERLYING ZONING IS A C3, WHICH IS A FRINGE TYPE COMMERCIAL ZONING THAT WOULD ALLOW OBVIOUSLY A SERVICE STATION. DRIVE THRU WITH SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE, WHICH DID COME BACK IN FOR AND IT ALLOWS FOR UP TO 150% OF THE FLOOR AREA. BY RIGHT, THEY ARE AT 15%. SO -- BUT THERE'S -- JUST -- IT'S UNLIKELY, I THINK THEY ARE GOING TO BE COMING BACK FOR ANY TYPE OF EXPANSION BECAUSE THEY ARE LIMITED BY PARKING. I CAN'T SEE HOW THEY COULD DO ANY MORE ADDITIONS BECAUSE OF THE PARKING. THIS SITE IS JUST ABOUT -- IT'S AS BUILT OUT AS IT'S GOING TO GET.
01:58:43.679: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONE?
01:58:45.113: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall:  I'M HAVING A HARD TIME WITH THE LAYOUT PLAN AS WELL.
01:58:51.920: >> OKAY.
01:58:52.187: >> AND THERE'S SOME THINGS I'M SEEING HERE THAT I'M ACTUALLY KIND OF SURPRISED IT GOT THROUGH STAFF REVIEW WITH SOME OF THAT, BECAUSE WHEN I LOOK AT THE PROPOSED PARKING DID, AND I'M ZOOMING IN ON SORT OF ETRACKIT SO I CAN READ WHAT'S GOING ON. IT'S HARD, IT'S HARD TO FOLLOW SOME OF THIS. IT'S NOT THE CLEANEST GRAPHICS I HAVE EVER SEEN IN TERMS OF CLARITY IN HOW THESE THINGS ARE PUT TOGETHER. THE AISLE THAT YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO DRIVE DOWN -- YOU KNOW, WHEN I LAY OUT A PARKING LOT, THERE'S AN 18 TO 20-FOOT -- OR 20 TO 22-FOOT AISLE THAT GOES DOWN THE MIDDLE OF YOUR PARKING LOT. YOU HAVE A BUNCH OF PARKING SPACES ACROSS FROM WHAT LOOKS LIKE AN ELEELEVATORRED -- IT IS. THERE'S A CURB --
01:59:36.631: >> IN THE GRADING PLAN.
01:59:39.968: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall:
01:59:40.669: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall:  IF YOU LOOK AT THE LAYOUT PLAN. IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S A PAVEMENT SIDEWALK ZONE ON THE CORNER THE BUILDING THAT HAS THE OVERFLOW DRAIN IN IT AND THINGS LIKE THAT. THAT'S A STEP UP.
01:59:53.982: >> IT'S AN OVERFLOW DRAIN THAT'S FEEDING THE BIORETENTION.
01:59:59.855: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall:  THAT'S FINE. AIM REFERRING TO THE POLYGON THERE.
02:00:02.858: >> THAT AS A CURB.
02:00:05.494: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall:  IT HAD A TOP OF CURB. THAT'S PROTRUDING INTO YOUR DRIVE AISLE BY, LIKE, SEVERAL FEET. SO IN OTHER WORDS IF I PARK IN SOME OF THOSE SPOTS OPPOSITE OF THAT, AND THEN OTHER CARS COME IN AND PARK BESIDE ME, THERE'S NO WAY FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO BACK OUT AND NOT GO UP OVER THE CURB BECAUSE YOU NEED AT LEAST 20 FEET BEHIND THOSE SPACES IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO LET THOSE SPACES --
02:00:35.590: >> SHEET C3 INDICATES THE DIMENSION BETWEEN IT. IT ACTUALLY EXCEEDS THE LANE WIDTH OF THE CITY REQUIREMENT.
02:00:41.997: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall:  WELL, BUT LOOK AT WHAT YOU HAVE ON YOUR LAYOUT PLAN. I SEE YOU HAVE YOUR MINIMUM DIMENSION IS 15 FEET.
02:00:50.372: >> NO, IT'S 22 FEET. 20 FEET.
02:00:55.210: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall:  WHAT SHEET SHOULD I BE LOOKING AT? I'M LOOKING AT A SITE LAYOUT LAP.
02:01:00.148: >> C3.
02:01:03.585: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall:  IT'S ON C3. WHAT I SEE --
02:01:07.989: >> 20-FOOT BETWEEN PARKING AND --
02:01:09.357: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall:  THAT'S 20 FEET. THAT'S FURTHER DOWN. OKAY? SO THOSE PEOPLE ARE FINE.
02:01:15.864: >> OKAY. I SEE WHAT YOU ARE SAYING.
02:01:17.732: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall:  THERE'S 15 FEET.
02:01:19.734: >> EXCUSE ME, I FORGOT MY CLASSES.
02:01:22.637: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall:  I NEED MINE TOO.
02:01:24.473: >> AND THEY PRINTED IT ON A SMALL THING. THAT WAS MAINTAINING 20 FEET. I THINK PROBABLY WHAT IS GOING ON AND WHY IT GET THROUGH STAFF AND STUFF, THERE'S AN EASEMENT RUNNING ALONG THE PROPERTY LINE THERE THAT 12 FEET OR 13 FEET WIDE. AND WE HAVE BEEN PLAYING A LIVE HAVOC WITH BECAUSE OF THE UNDERGROUND DETENTION. IT'S SANITARY SEWER. SO WE CAN'T REALLY CONSTRUCT OVER THE EASEMENT AREA. SO THAT AREA IN FRONT OF THERE WAS GOING FROM 15 TO 10 AND I ASSURE YOU THAT IS 20 FEET THERE FOR THE -- FOR THE BIORETENTION. IT'S JUST IT KEPT MOVING FROM 10 TO 15.
02:02:05.547: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall:  BUT THIS POLYGON OF THE SIDEWALK.
02:02:09.184: >> RIGHT.
02:02:09.484: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall:  HOW FAR IS THAT FROM THE BACK OF --
02:02:13.822: >> 20 FEET.
02:02:14.155: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall:  20 FEET FROM --
02:02:16.658: >> YES.
02:02:16.925: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall:  SO THIS IS WRONG ON WHAT I'M LOOKING AT?
02:02:19.995: >> THAT DIMENSION ON THERE MUST HAVE BEEN NOT THERE --
02:02:23.865: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall:  BUT IT'S NOT LINING UP. YOU HAVE 20-FOOT DIMENSION FURTHER DOWN AND THIS THING IS PROTRUDING INTO THAT DIMENSION. SOMETHING IS SCREWY HERE. SOMETHING IS SCREWY HERE, BECAUSE EITHER THAT SIDEWALK SHOULD LINE UP WITH THE AISLE THAT'S GOING DOWN THE MIDDLE.
02:02:40.248: >> YES, IT'S REQUIRED TO HAVE 20 FEET.
02:02:42.217: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall:  RIGHT.
02:02:43.285: >> AND THE BIORETENTION WORKED OUT TO IT.
02:02:45.287: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall:  SO IN OTHER WORDS, THIS SIDEWALK IS SHOWN INCORRECTLY?
02:02:48.823: >> I THINK WHAT IS -- WHAT MUST HAVE HAPPENED IS JUST -- WAS IT TWO DAYS AGO, CHRIS? WHEN YOU RECOMMENDED SWITCHING TO A SMALL CAR?
02:03:00.802: >> SAY AGAIN.
02:03:01.436: >> YOU WENT TO A SMALL CAR OVER THERE, YOU SENT IT OVER TO CAITLIN. TO GO TO THAT SMALL CAR AND MOVE THAT FOR A WALKWAY THROUGH THERE FOR A PEDESTRIAN ACCESS?
02:03:11.012: >> WE WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT THAT TO SEE.
02:03:13.615: >> YEAH, BECAUSE IT DEFINITELY IS REQUIRED TO BE --
02:03:17.886: >>  -- [ OVERLAPPING SPEAKERS ]
02:03:19.854: >> TO REDUCE SOME OF THE SPACES TO SMALL CAR PARKING WHICH WOULD WIDEN THE AISLE BUT I DON'T KNOW IF WILL MEET THE 20.
02:03:25.460: >> THAT PROBABLY HAPPENED IN OUR OFFICE WHEN SHE MOVED IT FOR THE SMALL CARS, SHE MOVED IT OVER, BUT THERE WAS REQUIRED 20 FEET AND THE BIORETENTION WAS APPROVED.
02:03:34.769: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall:  NO, I'M NOT EVEN THINKING ABOUT THE BIORETENTION, I'M THINKING ABOUT THE SITE LA IOUT ON THE TOP AND IF I PARK IN ONE OF THOSE SPOTS --
02:03:44.579: >> YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. IT'S GOT TO BE 20 FEET. IT HAD TO BE 20 FEET AND IT WAS 20 FEET. THIS CHANGE WAS JUST MADE TWO DAYS AGO. AND I THINK IT JUST CAME UP BECAUSE OF THE SMALL CAR AND I THINK IT WAS AN ERROR IN MY OFFICE.
02:03:57.959: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall:  OKAY. SO --
02:04:01.129: >> THAT IS DEFINITELY REQUIRED TO BE 20 FEET.
02:04:03.331: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall:  BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IT SEEMS LIKE IT WOULD ALSO BE HARD FOR -- THERE'S LIKE A -- WHEN YOU FIRST PULL IN, THERE'S A LANDSCAPE ISLAND, THE ONE THAT HAS A RADIUS OF 5 FEET THAT. 5 FEET. THAT PROTRUDES FURTHER. I'M THINKING ABOUT THE DUMP TRUCK -- I DON'T KNOW --
02:04:30.358: >> THE DUMPSTER --
02:04:31.760: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall:  THERE'S THINGS GOING ON HERE THAT FEELS LIKE IT NEEDS TO BE -- I HAD A HARD TIME READING THESE DRAWINGS AND I FEEL LIKE THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT NEED TO BE CLEANED UP AND THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT NEED TO BE EVALUATE IT. THAT'S HOW I FEEL ABOUT IT. I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE ON THE FENCE THING. BECAUSE IF THAT IS AS STEEP SLOPE ON THE OTHER SIDE, THEN IT -- IF THEY OWNED THAT STEEP SLOPE, THEN IT'S THEIR LIABILITY AND THEY ARE WILLING TO TAKE THE RISK TO BE ABLE TO LET PEOPLE GO BACK AND FORTH TO WHOLE FOODS AND DO THEIR FULL SHOPPING EXPERIENCE WITH WHATEVER THAT IS. BUT IT'S NOT ON THEIR PROPERTY. IT'S CRANBROOK'S LIABILITY IF SOMEBODY FALLS DOWN THAT THING. I FEEL LIKE THERE NEEDS TO BE A FENCE THERE. I DON'T FEEL LIKE WE SHOULD -- IF IT'S THEIR RISK TO TAKE, THEN THAT'S ONE THING AND THEY ARE WILLING TO DO THAT BUT IT'S NOT THEIR RISK, IT'S SOMEBODY ELSE'S LIABILITY WITH THAT.
02:05:24.579: >> THE ACTUAL SLOPE IN THIS PARTICULAR AREA. AND I SO HE WHAT SHE DID, WHEN WE ADJUSTED THE SMALL CAR PARKING, SHE MOVED THE CURB. AND IT WENT FROM 16 TO 20 AND THAT'S WHY IT'S NOT 20 FEET, BECAUSE THE -- IN THE ORIGINAL PROPOSAL, IN THE APPROVED DOCUMENT THAT WE HAD PUT BEFORE STAFF, THE -- THE DUMPSTER IS IN THE CENTER OF THE 20-FOOT LANE AND THE 20-FOOT LANE LINES UP WITH THAT CURB AND I THINK ALL SHE DID WAS -- IN MY OFFICE, I WAS OUT IN THE FIELD QUITE A BIT TODAY. SHE WAS MOVING THINGS AROUND TO MAKE THE SMALL CAR PARK SO WE HAD IT THERE, AND SHE MOVED THAT CURB IN 4 FEET INSTEAD OF THE OPPOSITE.
02:06:11.292: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall:  SO I GUESS I FEEL LIKE I INTO NEED TO HAVE TS THING CLEANED UP FOR ME TO EVALUATE IT WELL.
02:06:19.167: >> IN ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT THE LIABILITY, THE SLOPE OVER TO THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE PROPERTY IS DOWN TO PROBABLY A 1 ON 6 AT THE SOUTHERN END. AND RIGHT AT THE STATION END, IT'S LIKE A 1 ON 4, O 1 ON 5. IF YOU GO FURTHER NORTH, IT'S LIKE A 1 ON 2. AND CRANBROOK.
02:06:39.587: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall:  WELL, THAT'S STEEP.
02:06:41.523: >> THAT'S HOW IT WAS CONSTRUCTED.
02:06:43.324: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall:  BUT WERE THEY --
02:06:46.227: >> SHE STHEY SHOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE --
02:06:49.230: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall:  THEY ARE NOT INVITING PEOPLE TO COME TO THEIR SITE. YOUR SITE MAY BE INVITING PEOPLE -- LIKE WE WERE SAYING WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO GO BACK AND FORTH AND THAT MEANS THE RISK IS ON --
02:06:59.974: >> HE SAYS PEOPLE DO GO BACK AND FORTH NOW. AND IT HAPPENS.
02:07:03.378: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall:  IT'S ENTIRELY REASONABLE FOR CRANBROOK TO WANT A FENCE THERE SO THEY DON'T GET SUED BECAUSE SOMEBODY SLIPS DOWN THE SLOPE AND SAYS YOU DIDN'T STOP ME FROM DOING IT.
02:07:12.787: >> AND I WOULD CONCUR IF THAT IS THE TRUTH AND WE DID TALK ABOUT THAT IN THE CITIZEN PARTICIPATION BUT IF THEY ARE THAT CONCERNED THEN THEY SHOULD RUN IT DOWN THE ENTIRE SITE TOO BECAUSE IT'S FAR MORE DANGEROUS AT THE NORTH END AND THAT'S WHERE MOST OF THE WALKING TRAFFIC IS COMING, IS THAT AT THE NORTH END OF THE PROPERTY NOT AT THE SOUTH END. THEY DON'T USUALLY WALK OVER HERE. THEY WALK OVER ON NORTH END BECAUSE THEY ARE COMING IN TO THE TIM HORTON'S.
02:07:37.412: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall:  I GUESS ALL I WOULD SAY IS I SUPPORT A FENCE BEING THERE ACTUALLY, BECAUSE I DON'T I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO USE SOMETHING THAT IS A STEEPER SLOPE AND IT PROTECTS CRANBROOK'S VERY REASONABLE LIABILITY CONCERNS THAT WE WOULD ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO GO DOWN A STEEPER AREA AND PARK ON THEIR PROPERTY AND USE THE TIM HORTON'S, WHATEVER.
02:07:56.965: >> I GUESS IT WOULD BE -- THE OWNERS POSITION THAT IF THEY FEEL LIKE IT IS A LIABILITY TO THEM, THAT THEY SHOULD BUILD A FENCE. I MEAN WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY ABOUT IT, WHETHER WE DO IT OR NOT. THAT'S ENTIRELY UP TO THEM IF THEY WANT ONE OR NOT. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
02:08:30.131: >> Chair Milshteyn: MR. MILLS.
02:08:30.765: >> Vice Chair Mills: I'M WITH COMMISSIONER BRIGGS ON FENCE. I DON'T THINK IT SHOULD BE THERE, IN PART BECAUSE I THINK THIS NEW ADDITION IS NOT NECESSARILY ADDING A -- A NEW ENTRANCE TO ANY RETAIL ON THAT SIDE. PEOPLE USE IT. AND HONESTLY, IF I WERE CRANBROOK, I WOULD BE ADDING MORE ACCESS TO THE SIDEWALK THROUGHOUT YOUR SITE. THAT'S THE BIG PROBLEM. I MOST OFTEN MOVE ON BICYCLE AND YOU HAVE TO GO OUT OF YOUR WAY. AND IT'S FASTER IF YOU ARE ON A BICYCLE. AND IF YOU ARE IN THE WHOLE FOODS. IF YOU THINK THE CLIENTELE, WHOLE FOODS, REI, THOSE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE MORE OFTEN THAN NOT -- THEY ARE MORE OFTEN THAN THE AVERAGE JOE TO SHOW UP ON A BICYCLE OR SHOW UP ON FOOT. AND WANT TO GET TO THE CORNER AND HONESTLY THAT CORNER, RIGHT THERE IS THE ONE WHERE THERE'S CROSSING. SO I DON'T SUPPORT PUTTING A FENCE UP THERE BECAUSE I HAVE CUT THROUGH THERE PERSONALLY, LIKE -- AND, THERE ARE STEEP SLOPES THAT ARE TOO STEEP, AND I THINK SIMILAR TO MEIJER ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY, LIKE, WE SHOULD BE TAKING DOWN SOME OF THOSE BERMS RATHER THAN ENCOURAGING THEM. SO THAT'S NOT THE PETITION BEFORE US, BUT ALL I'M SAYING IS I WOULDN'T PUT THAT -- I WOULD NOT SUPPORT PUTTING A FENCE THERE BECAUSE I WOULD HOPE THAT SOME DAY THAT FENCE WOULD NOT BE NEEDED BECAUSE WE WOULD HAVE MORE CONNECTIVITY WITH CRANBROOK AND THE ROAD. I DON'T THINK THAT THERE'S TONS OF PARKING. I HAVEN'T ACTUALLY SEEN THIS CORNER AS CONGESTED AND SO THE PEOPLE THAT ARRIVE IN CARS AREN'T ACTUALLY GOING TO GO ALL THE WAY AROUND AND WALK UP THE SLOPE. IT'S THE WEIRD PEDESTRIANS LIKE ME, RIGHT, THAT ARE WILLING TO DO THAT. SO I THINK IN TERMS OF THE FENCE, I'M NOT IN SUPPORT OF THAT. I -- I DO HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT TRAFFIC STUDY. MR. CHENG, YOU HAD ASKED ABOUT -- AND SOME OF THE ASSUMPTIONS IN TERMS OF THE SQUARE FOOTAGE. SO DO WE KNOW WHAT WAS USED AND IF NOT, I THINK I WOULD LIKE TO --
02:10:45.233: >> I BELIEVE ANSWER THAT.
02:10:47.235: >> Vice Chair Mills: YEAH.
02:10:47.835: >> THE ACTUAL TRAFFIC STUDY SAID THREE 1500 SQUARE FOOT UNITS AND IT WAS DONE BY SPALDING DEDUGGER AND REVIEWED BY YOUR TRAFFIC ENGINEER AND CONSIDERED TO BE ACCURATE.
02:10:58.946: >> Vice Chair Mills: GOT IT.
02:11:00.481: >> DID IT INCLUDE THE RESTAURANT USES, THE DRIVE THRU USES? BECAUSE --
02:11:07.422: >> NO, I THINK THEY TOOK THE IMPACT AS WHAT THE NEW ADDITION WAS GOING TO -- HOW IT WAS GOING TO IMPACT THE EXISTING. SO THAT'S -- THAT'S HOW -- THAT WAS THE PREMISE THAT SHE STARTED ON, AND THAT'S HOW SHE DID THE TRAFFIC STUDY, AND WHAT USES POSSIBLE L AND WENT DOWN THAT ROAD. SO I DON'T KNOW THAT SHE SPECIFICALLY -- I KNOW SHE DIDN'T SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS THE RESTAURANT. SHE TOOK THE RESTAURANT AS AN EXISTING USE AND LOOKED AT THIS AS WE DID THROUGH THE WHOLE PROJECT, AS A PROPOSED IMPACT ON THE EXISTING STRUCTURE THAT WAS ALREADY APPROVED AND OPERATING.
02:11:54.335: >> Vice Chair Mills: SO YOUR DECISION TO DO THE PARKING CALCULATIONS BASED ON -- REVISING THE INITIAL PARKING CALCULATIONS --
02:12:02.543: >> NO, CALCULATIONS WERE DIFFERENT. CALCULATIONS WERE ALL -- I TOOK THE OLD CALCULATIONS AND PUT THEM AS USED. WE TOOK OFF -- WE GENERATED BY INFILLING THE -- THE POND, PER SE, WHICH IS SITTING LIKE 10-FOOT AWAY FROM THE SIDEWALK RIGHT NOW AND IT'S A 6-FOOT DEEP HOLE THERE. SO WE'RE PROPOSING AND CLOSING THAT, AND THEN PUTTING LANDSCAPE ON TOP, ALONG WITH PARKING IN THE AREA. AND WE -- WE CREATED 21 SPACES THERE, WHICH WAS ADEQUATE FOR THE -- FOR THE NEW PROPOSED ADDITION. BUT WE TOOK AWAY EIGHT. THEY HAD SIX EXTRAS. SO WE ARE STILL IN EXCESS OF THE MINIMUM, AND --
02:12:43.818: >> Vice Chair Mills: I UNDERSTAND. I'M CURIOUS FOR STAFF, IS IT CUSTOMARY -- BECAUSE OF THIS SITE, ROUTE, LIKE WHEN YOU ARE OPENING IT BACK UP, BRINGING PARKING INTO COMPLIANCE, IS SOMETHING -- AND SO MAKING THE PARKING ACCORDING TO WHAT'S ACTUALLY THERE SEEMS REASONABLE. WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT THE TRAFFIC? DO WE REQUIRE THE TRAFFIC STUDY FOR THE ADDITION OR THE WHOLE SITE?
02:13:06.307: >> I'M JUST OBSERVING THE TRAFFIC STUDY NOW, WHERE IT'S -- IT'S GOT -- AS FAR AS CONVENIENCE MARKET, IT'S SAYING THAT IT'S GOT EXISTING -- THEY USE 4,000 AND 80 AND PROPOSE 4,080. AND IT'S CLOSE TO 8,000 SQUARE FEET, IF I'M READING THE CHART CORRECTLY. AND I WILL -- AS FAR AS THE CONCLUSION THEN GOES, IT SAYS THE IMPACT OF THE PROPOSED EXPANSION ON ADJACENT ROADWAYS IS NOT SIGNIFICANT. THE ADDITION AND THE REALIGNMENT OF PARKING STALLS WILL IMPROVE ON SITE CIRCULATION AND OFFER EASIER ACCESS TO ALL BUILDINGS ON THE SITE. I'M JUST GOING BY WHAT'S IN THE STAFF REPORT. I DON'T KNOW WITHOUT PROBABLY DOUBLE CHECKING, THOUGH, WITH THE TRAFFIC ENGINEER TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE NUMBERS ARE ACTUALLY ALIGNING WITH WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED TO THE EXACT NUMBER. I'M JUST GIVING YOU A BRIEF SUMMARY OF WHAT I'M READING OFF FROM THE TRAFFIC REPORT.
02:13:56.991: >> Planning Manager:  CHRIS, I THINK IT'S A DIFFERENT QUESTION. COULD YOU SUMMARIZE HOW YOU MEASURED THE ADEQUACY OF PARKING ON THE SITE.
02:14:04.765: >> YES, WE BROKE IT DOWN BY THE TYPES OF USES ON THERE. I THINK IN THE CHART, WE BROKE IT DOWN -- IT'S TEN SPACES FOR THE RESTAURANT USE. IT WAS X AMOUNT OF SPACES FOR THE FUELING STATION AND X AMOUNT OF SPACES FOR THE PROPOSED RETAIL/OFFICE, ADDED THEM UP AND IT'S -- THEY ARE PROPOSING 39. I BELIEVE OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD, REQUIRED IS 31. BUT THOSE ARE OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD CALCULATIONS.
02:14:29.457: >> Planning Manager:  SO TO BE CLEAR, WE CONSIDER THE SITE IN TOE TOTO, ALL THE EXISTING U. IN YOU LOOK ON THE BOTTOM RIGHT CORNER, THAT'S WHERE YOU GET THE SUMMARY OF THE TRAFFIC GENERATION. SEPARATE CALCULATION THAN THE PARKING. THAT'S WHERE YOU WILL NOTE THAT THE PETITIONER PROVIDED TRIP GENERATION ANALYSIS THAT COMPARES WHAT IS THERE NOW, VERSUS HOW THOSE PEAK HOUR TRIPS WOULD CHANGE, BASED ON THE ADDITION AND THAT'S THE SUMMARY FOR THE TRAFFIC. SO IN SORT, WE LOOK AT THE TOTALITY OF THE SITE TO MAKE THAT IT'S MEETING THE PARKING REQUIREMENTS AND FROM A TRAFFIC PERSPECTIVE, THE TRAFFIC ENGINEER IS LOOKING AT HOW THIS IS GOING TO INCREMENTALLY CHANGE AS PART OF THEIR EVALUATION.
02:15:16.537: >> Vice Chair Mills: GOT IT. SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CAME UP -- SORRY, I KEEP ON MIXING TRAFFIC AND PARKING, BUT IT'S BECAUSE ONE, WE SAID WE ARE JUST GOING TO TREAT EXISTING AS IT IS. AND THE OTHER ONE -- AND JUST ADD TO IT FOR TRAFFIC. RIGHT? AND THE OTHER ONE SAYS WE ARE GOING TO LOOK AT -- WE ARE RELATE DO THE CALCULATION FOR THE WHOLE SITE ON PARKING. IT LOOKS AT WHAT IS ALREADY THERE AS EXISTING AND THEN SAYS, OKAY, WHAT IS THIS ADDITION GOING TO BE ON TOP OF THAT, RIGHT?
02:15:42.930: >> Planning Manager:  YES, AND IT ALSO TAKES INTO BEING CURRENT TRIP VOLUMES ON THE ADJACENT NETWORK. AND THE TRAFFIC CRITERIA HAVE NOT CHANGED SUBSTANTIALLY SINCE THIS WAS REVIEWED. SO IN LOOKING AT THAT INCREMENTAL CHANGE, THEY ARE STILL BASING IT ON A SIMILAR ANALYSIS PRO PROTOCOL THAT'S WHY THE ADDITIONAL TRIPS FROM THE GENERATION ARE APPROPRIATE.
02:16:08.823: >> Vice Chair Mills: GOT IT.
02:16:09.457: >> AND THEN IF I MAY ADD, WE DID CALCULATE IT DIFFERENTLY TOO. SO WE DID PUT IN THE RESTAURANT AND IT WAS STILL MORE THAN ADEQUATE PARKING. IT DIDN'T CHANGE.
02:16:19.934: >> Vice Chair Mills: THANKS.
02:16:20.534: >> SO WE DID IT BOTH WAYS.
02:16:24.071: >> Vice Chair Mills: THE -- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT STUCK OUT IS THAT OUR MULTIPLIER FOR RESTAURANT SPACE IS VERY -- IT REQUIRES A WHOLE LOT MORE PARKING FOR RESTAURANT SQUARE FOOTAGE. SO I'M NOT GOING TO BE PERSON TO ASK FOR MORE PARKING BY ANY MEANS, RIGHT, BUT THE QUESTION IS, IS IT PRESIDENT OBAMAABLE OBAMAABLE -- IS IT REASONABLE TO ASSUME THAT THIS ADDITION IS NOT GOING TO BECOME A RESTAURANT? THAT IT'S GOING TO BE RETAIL? IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THAT SHIFTED SINCE 2013, THAT IT WASN'T INITIALLY ANTICIPATED AS A RESTAURANT AND NOW THERE IS RESTAURANT SPACE, THAT THEY HAVE TO ACCOUNT FOR IN THEIR PARKING. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE CLEAR ON THAT. 'EM.
02:17:10.684: >> YOU ARE REQUIRED FOR A RESTAURANT SPACE, THEY HAVE A TIM HORTON'S. IF THEY CONVERT THE 4 THROUGH 40 SQUARE FEET, THEY ARE GOING TO REQUIRE 40 PARKING SPACES AND IT'S OUT OF COMPLIANCE IT. WE WOULD NOT APPROVE A RESTAURANT-TYPE USE BUT WHAT THE PETITIONER HAS, I THINK INDICATED, IT WILL BE MAYBE LIKE A CELL PHONE-TYPE STORE, POSSIBLY SOME TYPE OF MASSAGE THERAPY OR THOSE TYPES OF USES THAT WOULD FALL MORE IN LINE WITH A REGULAR TYPE OF RETAIL USE, NOT AN INTENSE RESTAURANT USE.
02:17:45.586: >> Vice Chair Mills: SO THE PARKING CALCULATIONS, THEY WOULD BE RERUN WHEN THEY DO BUILDING PERMITS FOR -- EVEN IF THERE'S AN INTERNAL CONFIGURATION AND IT'S GOING FROM -- LET'S SAY IT STARTS OUT AS A CELL PHONE STORE AND THEN IT TURNS INTO A RESTAURANT IN FUTURE, WHEN THEY GO TO PULL THOSE BUILDING PERMITS, YOU ARE GOING TO CHECK THE PARKING CALCULATIONS AGAIN?
02:18:11.545: >> THE ZONING COORDINATOR SHOULD. THEY SHOULD REFER TO WHAT'S IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL REGS. IT ALLOWS C1 TYPE USES WHICH MAY BE LIKE A MOM AND POP TYPE RESTAURANT WITHOUT ANY TYPE OF DRIVE THRU BUT WE WOULD HAVE TO THEN STATE, THEY ARE GOING TO BE WELL, WELL UNDER WHAT THE PARKING REQUIREMENT IS AND IT WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED. HOPEFULLY THEY ARE LISTENING TONIGHT THAT A RESTAURANT USE IS NOT GOING TO BE APPROVED AS PART OF YOUR BUILDING APPLICATION.
02:18:36.537: >> MORE THAN LIKELY, THEY WILL NOT WANT A COMPETING RESTAURANT IN THE SAME AREA.
02:18:41.141: >> Vice Chair Mills: SURE.
02:18:44.645: >> Planning Manager:  I WOULD JUST TACK ON, THIS -- YOUR CONVERSATION IS SOMETHING THAT THE CODE, I THINK WRESTLES WITH. WE HAVE PROVISIONS FOR RETAIL. WE HAVE PROVISIONS FOR RESTAURANTS AND WE HAVE PROVISIONS FOR RETAIL CENTERS WHICH ARE INTENDED TO ACCOMMODATE SOME BLEND OF THOSE THINGS. WE HAVE EXPERIENCED A LOT OF DEVELOPMENT IN THE CITY THAT IS EVOLVING FROM A TRUE -- WHAT I WOULD SAY IS A BLEND OF RETAIL AND RESTAURANT. WHEN THAT HAPPENS IT'S MORE OF A PARKING DEMAND. AND THIS CIRCUMSTANCE CALCULATING THE PARKING BASED ON THE ACTUAL PROJECTED USES IS PROBABLY A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. BUT IN SHORT, WE DO ATTEMPT TO PROVIDE THAT -- THAT MEASURE WHEN AN OCCUPANCY IS PROPOSED. IN THIS CASE, WE ARE NOT APPROVING IT WITH THAT FLEXIBILITY. SO WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO LOOK AT THE PARKING ISSUES BASED ON THE CALCULATIONS.
02:19:46.874: >> Vice Chair Mills: AND JUST TO CLOSE THAT LOOP, I'M OKAY WITH THE NUMBER OF PARKING SPOTS, BUT I SHARE COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL'S CONCERN ABOUT THE -- I SAW THE SAME 15. SO THAT NEEDS TO BE CLEARLY DEALT WITH. BUT I'M NOT ENCOURAGING MORE PARKING. I JUST WANT TO UNDERSTAND HOW IT ALL WORKS.
02:20:07.962: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONE.
02:20:09.229: >> Commissioner Sauve: YOU TOOK THE WORDS ABOUT RETAIL CENTER OUT OF MY MOUTH. I DID THE QUICK SQUARE FOOTAGE CALCULATION AND IF IT'S RETAIL, IT COMPLIES WITH THE 310 SQUARE FEET WHICH WOULD ONLY REQUIRE 28. AND COULD ALLOW FOR A QUICK SERVE SANDWICH S SHOP AND COFFEE SHOP AND THREE MORE RESTAURANTS AS RETAIL. SO ACTUALLY, IF IT FELL UNDER THAT, IT COULD BE 28 SPOTS AND COULD BE THREE MORE RESTAURANTS WHERE THIS ACTUALLY REQUIRES MORE PARKING AND NOT RESTAURANTS. SO WE'RE ACTUALLY REINFORCING LOTS OF PARKING IN THIS SCENARIO AND AS A FUELING STATION, I GUESS IT MAKES SENSE. HOW MUCH CARS ARE KIND OF MOVING THROUGH HERE. SO I GUESS THAT WAS KIND OF THE SECOND PART OF THAT CONVERSATION WHERE WE TIE IN PARKING WITH TRAFFIC. WAS THIS EVALUATED AT ALL AS A RETAIL CENTER AS LOAD?
02:21:09.923: >> IT WAS DONE AS TRIP GENERATION -- SUPER CONVENIENCE MARKET GAS STATION. WE LOOKED AT IT UNDER --
02:21:17.197: >> Commissioner Sauve: THEY HAVE THAT AND THEN THEY --
02:21:18.599: >> AND THEN ELECTRONICS. SO -- THEY MAY HAVE LOOKED AT IT IN DIFFERENT TYPE OF SCENARIOS.
02:21:26.173: >> Commissioner Sauve: THAT'S WHAT I SEE ON THE CURRENT ONE REVIEWED, MEDICAL/DENTAL OFFICE BUILDING FOR EVERYTHING. AND THEN 1500 SQUARE FEET, IT'S NOT NOTED WHAT THAT THIRD USE IS, ACTUALLY.
02:21:41.655: >> ACTUALLY, THAT WAS STORAGE FOR THE GAS STATION.
02:21:46.026: >> Commissioner Sauve: 1500 SQUARE FEET.
02:21:48.729: >> THE 790 SQUARE FEET WHERE THE STAIRWAY --
02:21:51.565: >> Commissioner Sauve: I'M LOOKING AT THE TRAFFIC ANALYSIS. SUPER CONVENIENCE MARKET GAS STATION, PROPOSED 4,080 SQUARE FEET. MEDICAL DENTAL OFFICE. 1550 SQUARE FEET. AND THEN BLANK USE, 1550 SQUARE FEET.
02:22:10.084: >> RIGHT.
02:22:10.384: >> Commissioner Sauve: WHICH LOOKS LIKE IT'S EVALUATED AT A HIGHER TRIP GENERATION AT 4.3, INSTEAD OF 3.5. SO I'M GUESSING THAT'S BUSINESS INSTEAD OF MEDICAL OFFICE. IT'S JUST NOT NOTED IN THERE.
02:22:20.994: >> NOT KNOWING WHAT'S IN THERE, I THINK SHE WAS TRYING TO MIX IT UP A LITTLE BIT.
02:22:27.234: >> Commissioner Sauve: SO THOSE WERE THE CONDITIONS I WAS LOOKING AT AND TRYING TO SPEAK -- LIKE, I FEEL COMFORTABLE THAT THIS IS MORE PARKING THAN OTHER WAYS YOU COULD CALCULATE IT. SO IN TERMS OF THOSE CONCERNS, RIGHT, WE COULD COUNT THIS A FEW DIFFERENT WAYS, ACTUALLY, BASED ON USE AND THIS GETS YOU THE MOST PARKING IN AN INTERSECTION THAT, YEAH, IS CAR CENTRIC. I KNOW THAT THERE COULD BE WALKABLE AREAS BUT IT'S NOT GEARED TOWARDS THAT. YES, THAT MAKES SENSE TO ME. THE OTHER QUESTION I ACTUALLY HAD REAR -- YOU HAVE REAR SERVICE ENTRIES TO ALL OF THE RETAIL. BUT IT DOESN'T SHOW SIDEWALK OR GRADING.
02:23:08.976: >> YES, WE JUST MADE THAT MODIFICATION AS WELL EARLIER. WE MOVED THE BUILDING 1.5 FEET. IT'S 6 FEET OFF, REDUCING THE SQUARE FOOTAGE, ACTUALLY, AND WHERE THE REAR ENTRY SHOWED ON THE BUILDING, WE CHANGED THE FRONT DOOR ON THE SOUTHERN UNIT TO OPEN TOWARDS ANN ARBOR -- OR EISENHOWER ROAD. SO IT OPENS TOWARDS THE PARKING.
02:23:35.402: >> Commissioner Sauve: OKAY.
02:23:36.203: >> THINKING THAT WILL KEEP THAT PARKING WITH THAT UNIT DOWN THERE. ON THAT SIDE, BECAUSE AT THE PRESENT MOMENT, THEY ARE FEELING THEY ARE GOING TO LEASE THE FIRST TWO SPACES TO P.T., I THINK IT'S PHYSICAL. AND IN THE REAR THERE WILL BE A SIDEWALK THAT WILL NEED FOR THEM TO GO OUT AND ENTER IN THE REAR OF THE BUILDING, IF NECESSARY, BUT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT COMES UP DURING BUILDING BECAUSE OF THE ACCESS POINTS WITH. WE HAVE NO MORE THAN 75-FOOT TRAVEL DISTANCE, DEPENDING ON OCCUPANT LOAD.
02:24:14.208: >> Commissioner Sauve: IT'S A PINCH POINT IN THAT BACK, PUTTING UP A FENCE. THE DOOR SWINGS AND IF YOU ARE EXITING OUT OF THAT AND THE DOOR SWINGS OPEN AND YOU ARE PINCHED BETWEEN AN OPEN DOOR AN A FENCE, YOU ACTUALLY CAN'T MANEUVER AROUND AND GET PAST THAT BLOCKAGE.
02:24:30.757: >> AT THIS MOMENT, WE DO HAVE 6.
02:24:34.494: >> Commissioner Sauve: BEFORE THAT. YOU 6 FEET CLEARANCE AND 6 FEET DOOR SWING. OKAY. THAT'S SOMETHING I WANT TO MAKE SURE IS IN THE SET OF UPDATED PLANS BEFORE IT MOVES ON.
02:24:46.874: >> THAT'S A GOOD POINT. I DID SPEAK WITH THE BUILDING DEPARTMENT REGARDING THAT SPACE. BECAUSE OF THE GRADE IN THE BACK, THEY MAY HAVE TO PUT A RAILING UP. SO FOR SAFETY ISSUE. WHY THEY DIDN'T WANT TO GO TOO FAR INTO IT ACTUALLY, PUTTING SOMETHING -- A LAYOUT THAT'S EXACT IS THE BIL BUILDING DEPARTMENT, STATED HOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING IN THERE? THAT WILL DETERMINE HOW MUCH EGREENBELT HE IS IS GOING TO BE REQUIRED -- EGRESS IS GOING TO BE REQUIRED. THERE IS ENOUGH SPACE BETWEEN THE PROPERTY LINE AND THE BUILDING AND THERE WILL PROBABLY NEED TO BE A RAILING TO HAVE A SECONDARY MEANS OF EGRESS TO EXIT THE BUILDING.
02:25:28.815: >> Commissioner Sauve: OKAY. THOSE WERE MY TWO MAIN ONES. THANKS.
02:25:37.090: >> Chair Milshteyn: TO TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT PARKING. SO THERE ARE 39 SPOTS PROPOSED.
02:25:43.230: >> CORRECT.
02:25:43.563: >> Chair Milshteyn: 12 ARE USED FOR THE GAS PUMPS. 10 ARE FOR THE DRIVE THRU; IS THAT CORRECT? AM I UNDERSTANDING THAT?
02:25:54.441: >> NO, NO, THERE'S ACTUALLY STACKING ON TOP OF THAT. SO THERE'S STACKING. THAT'S NOT COUNTED IN THE PARKING. SO THE DRIVE THRU HAS ITS OWN STACKING. THERE'S NINE SPACES FOR THE DRIVE THRU THAT WAS APPROVED, I BELIEVE, BACK THREE YEARS AGO.
02:26:10.557: >> Chair Milshteyn: GOT IT. OKAY. SO PART OF THE REASON WHY I'M TALKING ABOUT PARKING IS BECAUSE I USE THIS GAS STATION ON A FAIRLY REGULAR BASIS AND IT IS A GIANT MESS THERE MOST DAYS, WITH PARKING AND SUCH. SO I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED. SO OUTSIDE OF THE -- SO IF WE CAN GO BACK -- OR IF YOU CAN TAKE US TO THE PROPOSED PLAN.
02:26:34.948: >> SURE.
02:26:35.282: >> Chair Milshteyn: AND IF YOU CAN WALK ME THROUGH EXACTLY WHERE ALL OF THE PARKING IS ON THE SITE.
02:26:39.753: >> ALL THE PARKING RIGHT NOW IS --
02:26:42.522: >> Chair Milshteyn: NOT WHERE IT IS RIGHT NOW. WHERE IT WILL ALL BE.
02:26:45.158: >> OKAY. THESE SPACES ARE STAYING AS IS, THE FIVE SPACES OVER HERE FOR THE TIM HORTON'S. THERE'S PRESENTLY ONE SPACE HERE THAT'S HANDICAPPED, AND IF YOU FREQUENT THE STATION, YOU NOTICE THAT THERE'S ANOTHER SPACE RIGHT THERE THAT'S BEING REMOVED. AND JUST BECAUSE WE DIDN'T FEEL -- I THINK IT WAS ACTUALLY PUT IN WRONG, YOU KNOW, AT THE VERY BEGINNING WHEN THEY CONSTRUCTED BEFORE. THE STACKING IS OVER HERE. AS FAR AS TIM HORTON'S GOES, 90% OF THEIR -- 90% OF THEIR CUSTOMERS ARE GOING THROUGH THE DRIVE THRU AND THEN THEY HAVE PEOPLE THAT JUST WALK IN AND PICK UP AND LEAVE. THEY DON'T HAVE TOO MANY PEOPLE SITTING AROUND. AND, AGAIN IF YOU FREQUENT THE STATION, YOU PROBABLY WITNESS THAT. THE OWNER USES THAT AREA FOR THE MOST. AND THE PARKING AT THE PUMPS, THE CARS SITTING THERE GETTING THEIR FUEL, THEY GO IN AND GET THEIR RETAIL ITEMS OR THEIR CONVENIENCE STORE ITEMS, WHATEVER, YOU KNOW, POP, WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE. AND THEN -- SO THE PROPOSED ADDITION OVER HERE, THIS HAS BEEN PRIMARILY WHEN YOU GO IN THERE AND YOU SEE THE PEOPLE PARKING, THAT PARKING IS PRETTY FAR AWAY FROM THE ACTUAL ENTRANCE TO THE STATION. AND IF I CAN GO BACK TO THE EXISTING. IF YOU SEE THIS, YOU GO PAST THIS AREA, THERE'S AN AIR PUMP IN THERE. AND THEY PRESENTLY HAVE -- THEY HAVE ICE AND THEY GOT PROPANE OUT THERE AT THE MOMENT. AND THE PARKING IS OVER HERE. THIS PARKING IS ABOUT 50% FULL MOST OF THE TIME. AND -- AND MOST OF THAT IS PROBABLY EMPLOYEES OF THE GAS STATION AS FAR AS THAT GOES. SO WHAT WE DID WAS WE INFILLED THE POND AREA OVER HERE, AND WE CREATED ACTUALLY 21 NEW SPACES. AND THESE ARE PRIMARILY TWO -- TO TAKE CARE OF THE NEW RETAIL, WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE. RIGHT NOW IT LOOKS LIKE IT MIGHT BE 4,000 FEET -- OR 3,000. BUT IN THE EVENT THAT THERE'S A 1200 SQUARE FOOT USER OR RETAILER, YOU KNOW -- I DON'T KNOW, CELL PHONE STORE OR SOMETHING ALONG THAT LINE, WE WANTED TO HAVE THE PARKING ADEQUATE FOR THEM IN THE BACK ON THAT SIDE. WE TRIED T TO KEEP THE PARKING SEPARATE FROM THE GAS STATION USE. THAT'S WHY WE LOOKED AT IT ON THE IMPACT ON THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE SITE. SO MOST OF THE AREA THAT'S BEING IMPACTED RIGHT NOW IS NOT REALLY IN USE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE FOUR OR FIVE SPACES, THE EIGHT SPACES THAT ARE TAKING UP, BUT FOUR OR FIVE OF THEM ARE USED.
02:29:32.058: >> Chair Milshteyn: OKAY. SO I TEND TO AGREE WITH COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL IN REGARDS TO THE FENCE. IF THERE'S NO AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE TWO OWNERS ABOUT HAVING SOME SORT OF A SHARED SIDEWALK INSTALLED, WHICH DUE TO THE GRADE, STANCES ARE THAT THAT'S PROBLEM -- CHANCES THAT ARE THAT'S PROBABLY NOT TO GO TO HAPPEN. I THINK THERE'S AESTHETICALLY PLEASING FENCES. I'M NOT ASKING FOR A 6-FOOT FENCE PUT EVEN IF A 3-FOOT FENCE IS ENOUGH, BECAUSE THAT GRADE IS PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL. I THINK THAT HAS TO BE PART OF THIS PLAN. THE OTHER QUESTION IS IN REGARDS TO LOADING AND UNLOADING. WHERE DOES THAT HAPPEN? SO LOADING AND UNLOADING OF DELIVERIES, SO MERCHANDISE.
02:30:11.798: >> THE LOADING ZONE TECHNICALLY IS NOT A REQUIREMENT UNDER THE PUD DOCUMENT.
02:30:18.371: >> Chair Milshteyn: YEAH.
02:30:18.939: >> BUT WHAT THEY USUALLY DO IS IF YOU NOTICE IN THERE, THE -- THE LOADING USUALLY IS DONE OFF HOURS. SO LIKE THE GASOLINE, WHEN IT'S FILLED, FILLING THE TANKS, THEY COME OFF HOURS BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO BLOCK ANYBODY AND THEY DON'T WANT THEIR CUSTOMERS BLOCKED. SO THE SAME THING HAPPENS WITH THE LOADING AN THE UNLOADING. SO MORE THAN LIKELY, THEY WILL USE THE RETAIL SPACE WHERE THE PARKING IS RIGHT THERE. AND JUST PARK IN FRONT AND UNLOAD, EVEN NOW IF YOU ARE THERE QUITE A BIT, YOU WILL SEE THE -- THE TRUCKS PARK RIGHT OUT FRONT UNLOAD AND GO THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR, BRINGING IN THE POP OR WHATEVER ELSE. AND JUST AS -- AS A CONVENIENCE FOR THE STATION, AS AN OPERATIONAL STANDARD, THEY DON'T WANT TO -- THEY ARE NOT GOING TO WANT BLOCK THEIR PUMPS AND BLOCK OFF EVERYBODY, AND CREATE MORE TURMOIL THAN THEY ALREADY HAVE IN THEIR BUSY 40 BUSBUSYHOURS SO THEY USUALLY HAE EVERYTHING COME IN OFF HOURS. WE LOOKED AT PLOWING IN OVER HERE -- THERE'S ADEQUATE SPACE BECAUSE WE ARE IN EXCESS OF THE LANDSCAPING, BUT AS YOU KNOW, SINCE THE STATION HAS BEEN BUILT, IT'S BEEN A PILLAR. I MEAN, IT'S GORGEOUS COMING INTO THE CITY. IT'S VERY WELL KEPT AND WELL-MAINTAINED FOR THE LAST 16 YEARS. AND THE THOUGHT OF PLOWING IN AND DESTROYING SOME LANDSCAPING TO PUT A LOADING ZONE OUT HERE THAT PROBABLY WON'T EVER BE USED, IT WAS KIND OF LIKE A TRADEOFF. SO THAT'S HOW WE TOOK IT.
02:31:56.403: >> Chair Milshteyn: MR. CHENG, CAN YOU TALK ABOUT SIGNAGE WITH NOW ADDING POTENTIALLY THREE ADDITIONAL BUSINESSES ON THERE? YOU KNOW, THERE'S A SIGNAGE AT THE -- THERE'S LOTS OF SIGNAGE ON THIS SITE. HOW IS THAT WITH NEW BUSINESSES, HOW IS THE SIGNAGE GOING TO CHANGE WHAT MORE SIGNAGE WILL BE ALLOWED ON THE SITE, ESPECIALLY WITH THE LARGE, YOU KNOW, PRICE SIGN THAT'S AT THE CORNER AND ADDITIONAL SIGNAGE ON THE BUILDING.
02:32:25.098: >> EACH NEW OFFICE IS ALLOWED 2E BUILDING SQUARE FOOTAGE. EACH NEW BUSINESS WILL GET ITS OWN AMOUNT OF SIGNAGE. LET'S SAY EACH STORE FRONT IS 20 FEET WIDE, YOU WILL GET 40 SQUARE FEET OF SIGNAGE. I KNOW WE HAVE GONE BACK AND FORTH. WE HAVE GONE OUT THERE AND DONE ENFORCEMENT ON TAKING DOWN A LOT OF THE SIGNS OUT THERE. THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF CREEP. IT DOES COME BACK AND WE WILL HAVE TO ENFORCE ON TEMPORARY SIGNAGE THAT MAY BE OUT THERE, LETTING THEM KNOW THAT IT'S NOT ALLOWED. IT'S KIND OF A GIVE AND TAKE.
02:32:56.930: >> Chair Milshteyn: AND IN REGARDS TO THE MONUMENT SIGN AT THE FRONT.
02:32:59.566: >> YYOUYOU ARE PERMITTED TO HAVA MONUMENT SIGN. I THINK YOU CAN HAVE UP TO 200 SQUARE FEET OF A MONUMENT SIGN.
02:33:09.976: >> Chair Milshteyn: OKAY. COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN.
02:33:11.711: >> Councilmember Ackerman: ON THE FENCE ISSUE, I MIGHT SUGGEST WE TAKE A VOTE SINCE THERE ARE DIFFERENCES OF OPINION. WHERE WOULD -- BASED ON CONVERSATION, WHAT WOULD YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS FOR, YOU KNOW, DIMENSIONS OR LOCATIONS OF THAT FENCE BE?
02:33:32.732: >> Planning Manager:  I GUESS I WOULD -- I PROBABLY WOULDN'T JUMP INTO THAT. I THINK YOUR INITIAL THOUGHT IS PROBABLY HELPFUL. I'M HEARING THE SAME. IT SOUNDS -- IF I HAD TO PREDICT AT THIS POINT, I'M THINKING WE ARE HEADING TOWARDS A POSTPONEMENT FOR SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND CLARIFICATIONS ON THE DRAWINGS. I GUESS I WOULD LEAVE SOME OF THAT DESIGN TO THE PETITIONER AS IT RELATES TO THE ENTRYWAY DOORS LEADING TO THE BACK OF THEIR FACILITY WHERE THE SLOPES ARE MORE SEVERE AND MAYBE LESS BUT I THINK AT A MONEY MUM, IT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR THE PETITIONER TO HAVE A SENSE FROM THIS PLANNING COMMISSION IF THERE SHOULD BE A FENCE ON THERE OR NOT. [ LAUGHTER ]
02:34:13.139: >> Councilmember Ackerman: HOW ABOUT THIS. I WILL MOVE A POSTPONEMENT WITH THE DIRECTION THAT THE DIMENSIONS BE CLEANED UP, AND THAT ALSO STAFF EXPLORE WITH THE PETITIONER A FENCE. IF YOU DON'T WANT A FENCE, YOU CAN VOTE DOWN THIS MOTION TO POSTPONE AND THEN WE CAN INTRODUCE A DIFFERENT MOTION TO POSTPONE THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE EXPLORING A FENCE. HOW DOES THAT SOUND?
02:34:41.501: >> Chair Milshteyn: SO IT'S MOVED AND CAN WE GET IT SECONDED?
02:34:46.506: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall:  NOT QUITE A SECOND YET. I WANT TO CLARIFY ONE THING ON THE BENZ BUSINESS AND WALKWAY AND THAT IS THOSE GRADES ARE REALLY STEEP. THERE IS NO WAY THEY COULD EVER PUT IN A SIDEWALK AND HAVE IT BE COMPLIANT EVER. IF THIS WERE FLAT, I WOULD BE SAYING SOMETHING DIFFERENT, BUT IT'S NOT. IT WOULD HAVE TO BE STEPS OR SUPER STEEP AND THAT'S JUST THE REALITY THAT AHE IS OUT THERE'S. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT'S PART OF HOW PEOPLE MAKE THEIR DECISION.
02:35:14.534: >> Chair Milshteyn: SO MOVE POSTPONEMENT WITH THE DIRECTION OF FENCE TO BE INSTALLED. IT'S BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL. DISCUSSION ON THAT? POSTPONEMENT --
02:35:24.944: >> THE FENCE DEBATE.
02:35:26.679: >> Chair Milshteyn: WITH THE FENCE. COMMISSIONER BRIGGS?
02:35:30.350: >> Commissioner Briggs: I DON'T THINK THIS ADDS ANYTHING NEW BUT I WILL SAY IT ANYWAY. I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE IN THE BUSINESS OF -- WE HAVE GOT -- I'M NOT -- THIS ADDITION IS NOTI NOT GOING TO ACTUALLY, PROBABLY SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE CHANGE IN PEDESTRIAN FLOW ALONG THERE, WHAT WE ALREADY HAVE IS THE ABILITY FOR SOME PEOPLE TO CUT THROUGH THERE, AND SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING IT AND I JUST DON'T KNOW WHY WE WOULD POSSIBLE -- I UNDERSTAND THERE'S SOME LIABILITY ISSUES. THAT'S NOT ANY CONCERN. MY CONCERN IS CONNECTIVITY THROUGH OUR COMMUNITY AND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT. SO I -- I UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU ARE COMING FROM BUT --
02:36:10.857: >> Chair Milshteyn: ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION ON POSTPONEMENT WITH A FENCE OR DIRECTION FOR A FENCE? LET'S DO A QUICK ROLL CALL VOTE.
02:36:26.906: >> Chair Milshteyn: YES.
02:36:27.774: >> Vice Chair Mills: NO.
02:36:28.308: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall:  YES.
02:36:31.444: >> Commissioner Abrons:  NO.
02:36:32.979: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES.
02:36:40.987: >> Commissioner Briggs: NO.
02:36:41.588: >> Commissioner HAMMERSCHMIDT:  NO.
02:36:55.368: >> Commissioner Sauve: NO.
02:36:57.036: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  I WANT TO REMIND --
02:37:01.307: >> Commissioner Sauve: THAT WAS A YES.
02:37:07.080: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  I WILL JUST REMIND FOLKS TO VOTE WITH YOUR MICROPHONE FOR CTN.
02:37:15.722: >> Planning Manager:  I HATE YOU ALL SO MUCH. THE MOTION FAILS. IT DOES NOT RECEIVE A MAJORITY OF THE BOARD. 4-4.
02:37:24.697: >> Chair Milshteyn: 4-4. GREAT. COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN.
02:37:28.301: >> Planning Manager:  BY I HATE YOU, I MEAN I LOVE YOU. [ LAUGHTER ]
02:37:31.371: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  I THINK EITHER WAY IS NOT WORKPLACE APPROPRIATE. [ LAUGHTER ] I MAKE A MOTION TO POSTPONE TO FIX DIMENSIONS WITHOUT CONVERSATION OF A FENCE.
02:37:45.284: >> Chair Milshteyn: DO WE HAVE A SECOND. SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER MILLS. ALL THOSE IN FAVOR, PLEASE SAY AYE. [CHORUS OF AYES]
02:37:56.362: >> Commissioner Briggs: IS THERE DISCUSSION?
02:37:57.664: >> Chair Milshteyn: SURE, DISCUSSION.
02:37:58.665: >> Commissioner Briggs: WHEN THIS COMES BACK, I APPRECIATE -- WHEN IT COMES BACK, I DON'T PLAN ON VOTING IN FAVOR OF THIS. I DON'T THINK IF I SAW THIS EXISTING PROPOSAL WITH -- WITH THIS, I DON'T THINK IT MEETS MY THOUGHT EVER WHAT KIND OF THE REQUIREMENTS FOR A PUD AND LOOKING BACK AT WHAT WAS THE JUSTIFICATION FOR THE PUD, I THINK THIS IS ADDING UNNECESSARY SORT OF INTENSITY AT THAT CORNER WHERE WE ARE ALREADY HAVING SOME CHALLENGES. SO I -- I'M NOT PARTICULARLY IN FAVOR OF THIS PROPOSAL, BUT I WON'T OBJECT TO MORE INFORMATION.
02:38:40.940: >> CAN I ASK A CLARIFICATION QUESTION?
02:38:44.777: >> SURE.
02:38:45.144: >> SINCE IT'S ALREADY DESIGNATED A PUD, IS PUBLIC BENEFIT SOMETHING THAT WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE CONSIDERING?
02:38:50.650: >> Planning Manager:  NO.
02:38:52.885: >> Commissioner Briggs: CAN YOU CLARIFY. MAYBE I NEED TO BE RECONSIDERING, WHAT I WILL BE VOTING FOR.
02:38:56.789: >> Planning Manager:  SO THE NO REZONING IS BEING PROPOSED AT THIS TIME. TO CONSIDER A PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT, THERE IS A PUBLIC BENEFIT DISCUSSION. THE CITY HAS REZONED THIS PROPERTY TO PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT. IT HAS NOW ESTABLISHED A ZONING DISTRICT IN WHICH THEY ARE SUBMITTING A SITE PLAN FOR CONSIDERATION UNDER THAT ZONING DISTRICT. SO YOUR REVIEW OF THIS WOULD BE IS THE SITE PLAN COMPLIANT WITH THE ZONING REGULATIONS. I DON'T BELIEVE IT IS -- IT'S NOT QUESTIONING THE ZONING. THAT ZONING HAS BEEN ENACTED.
02:39:33.292: >> Commissioner Briggs: OKAY. AND I GUESS -- ALL RIGHT.
02:39:41.567: >> MAYBE ALSO, IS IT POSSIBLE BETWEEN NOW AND THE NEXT TIME THAT WE DISCUSS THAT, THE STAFF CONFIRMS THE INACCURACIES AND OMISSIONS THAT WERE BROUGHT UP DURING THE PUBLIC COMMENT WERE RESOLVED.
02:39:52.812: >> Councilmember Ackerman: AND I WOULD ADD WORK ON THEM WITH DARK SKIES FOR ADDITIONAL LIGHTING.
02:39:59.385: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONE.
02:40:00.753: >> Commissioner Sauve: EVEN THOUGH THIS IS WITHOUT THE FENCE, I WOULD SAY BRINGING MORE INFORMATION AND CONVERSATION WITH YOUR NEIGHBOR ABOUT THE FENCE SO THAT WE CAN HAVE THAT DIALOGUE AGAIN, IF NOT IN THE PLANS, I THINK WOULD STILL BE WELCOME TO THE COMMISSION. SO AT LEAST ON MY END. LIKE, I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN SEEING -- [ OVERLAPPING SPEAKERS ]
02:40:24.110: >> I'M ALL ABOUT WORKING WITH NEIGHBORS AS CHRIS KNOWS WE SPENT SIX YEARS ON THE CIRCLE K DOWN THE ROAD. AND SO WE -- WE -- WE TAKE PEOPLE'S CONCERNS VERY SERIOUSLY. BUT -- AND IN THIS CASE, IT WAS JUST A LOT OF REVIEWING GOING ON AND QUESTIONING AND TRYING TO BLOCK THE ACTUAL PROJECT. SO IT'S -- IT'S GETTING A LITTLE DIFFERENT. IT'S NOT LIKE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO WORK TOGETHER. IT'S LIKE THEY ARE -- IT'S A LITTLE MORE DIFFICULT.
02:40:53.673: >> Commissioner Sauve: FOR WHERE THIS MOTION STANDS, YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT A REQUEST. THIS IS MY UNDERSTANDING, TO INCLUDE THE FENCE IN THE PLANS THE NEXT TIME WE REVIEW IT AS PART OF THE POSTPONEMENT, BUT AS PART OF THE DISCUSSION, THE NEXT TIME AROUND, I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN STILL SEEING CONDITIONS TO BE ABLE TO EVALUATE IT FURTHER.
02:41:14.727: >> SURE.
02:41:16.896: >> Chair Milshteyn: FURTHER DISCUSSION. COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL?
02:41:19.432: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall:  ONE OTHER THING, JUST FOR PUTTING IT IN THE HOPPER FOR NEXT TIME IS SOME THE LANDSCAPE MATERIAL WILL NOT HOLD UP WELL IN TERMS OF THE -- JUST HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO LIVE ALONG EISENHOWER AND SO THIS IS GOING TO DIE IN A YEAR. IT NEEDS A SMALL COURTYARD. IT'S ZONE FIVE. IT'S MORE LIKE A ZONE SIX PLAN. IT WILL NEVER HANDLE THE EXPOSURE AND THE SALT AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING. SO LOOK MORE CAREFULLY AT YOUR LANDSCAPE BUFFER THAT YOU ARE SQUEEZING IN 10 FEET. SO WE WOULD REALLY LIKE IT TO LIVE. SO I WOULD LIKE YOU TO WORK WITH WHOEVER DOES YOUR PLANTING DESIGN TO COME UP WITH SOME MORE ROBUST SPECIES SO THAT -- ENFORCEMENT IS HARD FOR THE CITY TO BE ABLE TO GO OUT AND SAY THIS MANY DIED. IT'S JUST HARD AND WE WOULD LIKE YOU TO USE SPECIES THAT WILL MAKE IT THE FIRST TIME AROUND. SO THERE'S SOME QUESTIONABLE THINGS IN THERE.
02:42:11.651: >> AND THE SITE ITSELF IS NOT -- IS MORE CONDUCIVE TO A WIDER GREEN BELT BECAUSE TYPICALLY THE SIDEWALKS ARE PUT OFF YOUR PROPERTY LINE. IN THIS CASE IT'S 10 FEET. IT'S REALLY 20 FEET FROM THE BACK OF THE CURB TO THAT. SO WE INTEND AND WE GOT THE APPROVAL TO KIND OF BLEND OUT THAT INTO THE RIGHT-OF-WAY AND GUIDE THAT ALL IN.
02:42:34.941: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall:  YEAH.
02:42:36.175: >> IT WASN'T LIKE WE WERE SQUEEZING -- RBI RIGHT.
02:42:41.847: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall:  RIGHT.
02:42:42.748: >> WE PUT A WALL THERE AND THERE WAS AN EASEMENT AND UP CAN'T HAVE A FOUNDATION INSIDE AN EASEMENT.
02:42:49.055: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall:  I GET ALL THAT. THAT'S FINE. I UNDERSTAND, YOU KNOW FROM READING THE STAFF REPORT.
02:42:53.726: >> BUT DEFINITELY.
02:42:55.161: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall:  I THINK THE SPECIES NEED TO BE MORE ROBUST IN TERMS OF LOCATIONS THAT YOU HAVE.
02:43:01.300: >> SURE. ABSOLUTELY.
02:43:02.902: >> Chair Milshteyn: FURTHER DISCUSSION ON POSTPONEMENT. ALL THOSE IN FAVOR OF POSTPONEMENT, PLEASE SAY AYE. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT IS POSTPONED. THOSE MEMBERS OF THE AUDIENCE WHO WISH TO BE NOTIFIED WHEN THIS COMES BACK FOR A HEARING AGAIN, PLEASE MAKE SURE TO FILL OUT A CARD AND PLACE IT IN THE -- IN THE LITTLE BOX RIGHT THERE. AND WE ARE GOING TO TAKE A SEVEN MINUTE RECESS. [ BREAK ]
02:51:19.197: >> Chair Milshteyn: WE ARE BACK. THE NEXT ITEM ON OUR AGENDA IS 10-B WHICH IS THE GLEN PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT PUD MODIFICATIONS FOR CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL. WE WILL BEGIN WITH A TEN-MINUTE PETITIONER PRESENTATION. WE WILL MOVE ON TO A STAFF REPORT AND AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION AND THEN DISCUSSION.
02:51:38.417: >> THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING. I'M CRAIG SINGER, THE DEVELOPER OF THE GLEN HOTEL. MY -- I'M HERE TONIGHT WITH MY PARTNERS LARRY DUTCH AND FRED GOLDBERG. WE HAVE GOT OUR ENGINEER ROB WAGNER FROM MIDWESTERN AND OUR ARCHITECTS AMO SEDAO WITH NEWMAN SMITH. AND HERE TO PRESENT OUR MODIFICATIONS FOR THE GLEN MIXED USE PUD. WE MADE THIS REQUEST A LITTLE OVER A YEAR AFTER RECEIVING OUR PUD APPROVAL AFTER COMMENCING WITH OUR ARCHITECTURAL CONSTRUCTION PLANS AND REVIEWING ALL OF OUR SCHEMATIC PLANS WITH OUR BRANDING PARTNER. WE HAVE DECIDED TO AND HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED BY MARRIOTT INTO THEIR AUTOGRAPHED COLLECTION OF HOTELS. MARRIOTT DESCRIBES AUTOGRAPH AS FOLLOWS:  THEY SAY WE HAND PICK AND CELEBRATE THE WORLD'S MOST UNIQUE BOUTIQUE HOTELS. EACH ONE IS CHOSEN FOR THE FOUNDER'S PASSION, THE THOUGHTFULNESS FOR THE DESIGN AND THE CONNECTION WITH THE LOCALE. OUR AIM IS TO SHOWCASE SOME OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL HOTEL EXPERIENCES IN THE WORLD, THAT THE WORLD HAS TO OFFER. WE ARE VERY EXCITED TO HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED INTO THIS HOTEL COLLECTION. IT AFFORDS US WITH THE USE OF THE MARRIOTT RESERVATION SYSTEM, WHILE MAINTAINING THE INDEPENDENCE OF AN INDIVIDUAL BOUTIQUE HOTEL WHICH WE THINK SHOULD BE UNIQUE AND SPECIAL FOR ANN ARBOR. SOME OF OUR PROPOSED MODIFICATIONS ARE THE RESULT OF PROPOSED IMPROVEMENTS BY THE DEVELOPER AND MARRIOTT AND SOME ARE THE RESULT OF ENGINEERING LIMITATIONS IN THE CONSTRUCTION PLAN PROCESS. A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF OUR PROPOSED CHANGES ARE AS FOLLOWS:  THE FIRST IS TO REVISE THE PEDESTRIAN ENTRANCE ON GLEN AVENUE. WE ARE NOT ADJUSTING OR CHANGING AT ALL THE VEHICULAR ENTRANCE TO THE BUILDING, BUT WE ARE MAKING SOME SLIGHT MODIFICATIONS TO THE PEDESTRIAN ACCESS OFF THE SIDEWALK IN FRONT OF THE BUILDING BY LIMITING -- WE ARE ACTUALLY ELIMINATING UP WITH OF THE ENTRANCES TO THE HOTEL AND TUCKING IT INTO THE PORTICO TO ELIMINATE SOME OF THE PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC CONCERNS AND MAKE, WE THINK, IMPROVEMENTS INTO THE LOBBY AND TRAFFIC EXPERIENCE. WE ARE REDUCING THE NUMBER OF LOWER LEVEL VALET DOUBLE PARKED SPACES, AND AS A RESULT, WE ARE GOING TO BE REDUCING THE NUMBER OF PARKING -- TOTAL PARKING SPACES IN THE BUILDING FROM 252, TO 241, BUT WE ARE STILL, -- WE STILL MAINTAIN OR EXCEED THE 235 REQUIRED MINIMUM UNDER THE CITY ORDINANCE. THE BUILDING AFTER IT'S ENGINEERED SHRUNK WITH THE WIDTH -- OUR AVAILABLE SPACE SHRUNK BECAUSE OUR WALLS GOT WIDER AND WE LOSE A FEW PARKING SPACES. WE ARE MAKING A REVISION TO THE REAR ELEVATION OF THE BUILDING TO ACCOMMODATE THE RELOCATION OF THE NORTHERN STAIRWELL AND THE WINDOW CONFIGURATION TO ACCOMMODATE SOME SLIGHT FLOOR PLAN CHANGES. WE AREN'T INCREASING. WE ARE REDUCING THE NUMBER OF ROOMS OR THE NUMBER OF WINDOWS BUT YOU WILL SEE -- YOU HAVE SEEN IN THE PRESENTATION SOME MINOR ELEVATION CHANGES ON THE BACK OF THE BUILDING. WE'RE REMOVING THE PTAC UNITS IN THE HOTEL ROOMS, WHICH ARE THE THROUGH WALL A.C. UNITS THAT WERE -- THAT WERE APPROVED ON THE BUILDING AND ARE JUST DEEMED NOT APPROPRIATE FOR HIGH-QUALITY HOTEL ROOM SUCH AS THE GLEN. WE WILL BE CHANGING THAT TO A CENTRALIZED HVAC SYSTEM, WHICH I THINK FROM AN EXTERIOR STANDPOINT, IT JUST ELIMINATES ALL OF THE VENTS IN THE ROOMS AND REPLACES THEM WITH GLASS. SO I THINK IT'S A BIG IMPROVEMENT. AND LASTLY, THE BUILDING HEIGHT. WE ARE MODIFYING THE BUILDING ELEVATIONS TO PROVIDE THE BUILDING REMAINING NINE STORIES PLUS THE -- PLUS THE SCREENING WALL. WE ARE REQUESTING THE INCREASE IN ORDER TO ACCOMMODATE THE ADDED DUCT WORK NEEDED WHEN ELIMINATING THE THROUGH WALL HVAC AS WELL AS NEEDED ADDITIONAL CEILING HEIGHT IN BANQUET AND RESTAURANT AND LOBBY SPACES. WE HAVE ACCOMMODATED THESE CHANGES BY BRINGING DOWN SOME OF THE ELEMENTS AT THE TOP OF THE BUILDING TO MAKE THE HEIGHT MODIFICATIONS, WE HOPE, LOOK LIKE THEY ARE NOT REALLY NOTICEABLE. AND I POINT THOSE OUT IN THE PLANS AS WELL. WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO GO THROUGH, JILL, OR DO YOU WANT TO GO THROUGH THE --
02:56:57.903: >> NO, GO AHEAD.
02:56:58.670: >> OKAY. SO THIS IS THE NEW FRONT ELEVATION OF THE BUILDING, AND ON TOP OF THE ROOF -- THERE'S TWO MAIN CHANGES TO THE TOP OF THE BUILDING HERE. WHERE YOU SEE THE ROUND WINDOW ON THE FRONT ELEVATION, THAT NOW HAS BEEN BROUGHT DOWN. IT USED TO EXCEED -- THAT WAS THE TALLEST PART OF THE STRUCTURE. WE SORT OF THE FLATTENED THAT OUT, AND WE ELIMINATED THE PENTHOUSE ON THE ROOF OF THE BUILDING. SO IN TERMS OF THE APPEARANCE OF THE BUILDING, WHEN YOU COMPARE IT TO THE OLD FRONT ELEVATION, WHICH IS -- THAT'S THE OLD FRONT ELEVATION. YOU CAN SEE HOW THAT CENTER PORTION EXTENDS UP AS WELL AS THERE'S ABOVE THE GLASS ON THE -- ON THE TALLEST PORTION OF THE BUILDING, THERE'S A PENTHOUSE, WHICH NO LONGER EXISTS. THAT'S THE REVISED. THIS IS THE -- THIS IS THE OLD BACK OF THE BUILDING. AND YOU CAN SEE THAT THE -- THAT ROUND WINDOW ON TOP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BACK OF THE BUILDING IS IN THAT PENTHOUSE, AND THEN THIS -- WE REDUCED THE SIZE -- WE BROUGHT IT DOWN INTO THE -- INTO THE HEIGHT. SO WE WERE ABLE TO ESSENTIALLY GET MORE HEIGHT ON THE FIRST TWO FLOORS WITHOUT THE BUILDING APPEALING -- APPEARING TALLER BECAUSE WE RAISED -- OR WE LOWERED THE ROOF ELEVATION. AND THEN IT'S -- HERE YOU CAN SEE THE -- IF YOU LOOK AT THE FIRST TWO FLOORS, THE DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF THE ELEVATION AND THE HEIGHT, AND -- AND THOSE ARE REALLY THE MAJOR EXTERIOR CHANGES IN TERMS OF THE STREET VIEW, IT WAS SIMPLY ELIMINATING THE PED ENTRANCE THAT WAS RIGHT UNDER THE ENTRANCE TO THE BUILDING, THE SIGNAGE TO THE BUILDING ON GLEN AVENUE AND TUCKING IT UNDER TO THE PORTICO SHARE WHERE THE CAR DROP OFF AREA WOULD BE. YOU CAN ACTUALLY ON THE REAR ELEVATION -- YOU CAN ALSO -- IT'S EASIER TO SEE THE PTAC UNITS WHICH ARE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE GLASS ON EVERY SINGLE ROOM. AND THE -- OH, HERE. THEY AREN'T THERE. AND HERE THEY ARE THIS. IF YOU -- YOU WOULD HAVE TO LOOK CAREFULLY AT THE GLASS CONFIGURATION, BUT IT'S -- IT'S PRETTY NOTICEABLE. IN PERSON IT WOULD BE MUCH MORE NOTICEABLE. SO THAT IS OUR PROPOSAL. WE ARE HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AND APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION.
03:00:08.059: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE WILL NOW HEAD OVER AND WELCOME MS. THATCHER FOR A STAFF REPORT.
03:00:13.965: >> JUST A FEW THINGS TO ADD TO THIS PETITION. THE OVERALL HEIGHT OF THE BUILDING INCREASED BY 6 FEET, BUT IT'S STILL BELOW THE 109 FEET 4-INCH MAXIMUM ALLOWED BY THE PUD THAT'S IN PLACE. SO THAT DOESN'T HAVE TO CHANGE IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS FOR THIS TO BE APPROVED. THE MIX OF BIKE PARKING SPACES HAS CHANGED 18 CLASS A AND 16 CLASS B, TO 14A AND 20B. FOUR SPACES THAT WERE IN THE PARKING STRUCTURE WERE SHIFTED UP ALONG EAST ANN STREET. I THINK THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY A POSITIVE, BECAUSE THEY WILL PROBABLY BE BETTER UTILIZED THERE, AND 14 IS STILL A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF CLASS A SPACES THAT ARE INSIDE. REALLY, THAT'S ABOUT ALL THAT I HAVE TO ADD. STAFF DOES BELIEVE THAT THESE ARE MINOR AND APPROPRIATE MODIFICATIONS. AND THAT IT MEETS THE SPIRIT AND THE INTENT OF THE EXISTING PUD AND THE CITY'S ORDINANCE. THANK YOU.
03:01:11.623: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU. AT THIS TIME, I WOULD LIKE TO OPEN UP A PUBLIC HEARING. ANYBODY IN THE AUDIENCE MAY ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION FOR UP TO THREE MINUTES. PLEASE STEP UP TO THE PODIUM AND STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS FOR THE RECORD.
03:01:27.672: >> HI, I'M CHRIS CROCK. I WANT TO SAY THAT CRAIG AND LARRY AND THEIR TEAM HAVE KEPT US INFORMED. THEY HAD A MEETING -- WHEN WAS IT?
03:01:36.915: >> SPRING.
03:01:37.248: >> WELL, IT WAS IN THE SPRING, THE NIGHT THERE WAS A BIG TORNADO WARNING AND THE MEETING WAS BROKEN UP BECAUSE WE ALL HAD TO TAKE SHELTER IN THE CELLAR OF THE LEAGUE. BUT WE THINK THAT THESE ARE GOOD IMPROVEMENTS. THEY HAVE KEPT US IN THE LOOP AND OUR CONCERN HAS ALWAYS BEEN ABOUT PEDESTRIAN SAFETY. THAT'S ONE OF OUR CONCERNS AND ABOUT ANY KIND OF DANGERS THAT MIGHT BE POSED BY INCREASED AUTOMOBILE TRAFFIC, WE FEEL THESE THINGS HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED, AND WE CAN SEE THIS PROJECT GOING FORWARD, ALTHOUGH I WARNED THEM THAT AT THE SAME TIME THAT THIS PROJECT IS ABOUT TO BE BUILT, THE UNIVERSITY IS PLANNING JUST A BLOCK AWAY TO BUILD THE SCHOOL OF PHARMACY AND ALSO DO CHANGES AND IMPROVEMENTS AND ENLARGEMENT ON THE POWER PLANT. ALL NEAR GLEN AND HURON. SO GOOD LUCK!
03:02:30.401: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN THE AWAUDIENCE WHO WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION? THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION HEREBY RECOMMENDS THAT THE MAYOR AND THE CITY COUNCIL APPROVE MODIFICATIONS TO THE GLEN MIXED USE PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT PUD ZONING DISTRICT, SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS AND PUD SITE PLAN, WITH THE CONDITION THAT THE FIVE LOTS ARE COMBINED BEFORE ISSUANCE OF ANY PERMITS. DO I HAVE A COMMISSIONER THAT WILL MOVE. MOVED BY COMMISSIONER MILLS AND SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER SAUVE. COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN.
03:03:02.700: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR. I'M EXCITED TO TALK ABOUT THIS ONE AGAIN. I THINK IT'S ONE OF THOSE PROJECTS THAT -- THAT GETS PLANNING COMMISSION AND CITY COUNCIL EXCITED ABOUT YOU KNOW, POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT, DEVELOPMENT AND WITH DEVELOPERS WHO ENGAGE NEIGHBORS AND PLAN SOMETHING TO PUT -- TO PUT IN SOMETHING TRULY OF NEED TO THE SURROUNDING AREA. I THINK THIS IS AN AREA OF TOWN THAT STILL NEEDS HOTELS AND STILL NEEDS EVENT SPACE, AND I WOULD RATHER THE HOSPITAL BE SERVED BY A HOTEL NEXT DOOR THAN UP THE PLYMOUTH CORE CORRI. I THINK THESE CHANGES ARE MODEST IN THERE ARE NATURE, ALL WELL WITHIN OR VERY CLOSE TO THE BOUNDS THAT WE SET NOW ALMOST A YEAR AGO. MAYBE MORE NOW EVEN. WOW! TIME IS FLYING. AND THEN JUST AS A REMINDER, IN ADDITION TO THE BENEFITS OF THE MIXED USE PROJECT ITSELF, ACCOMPANYING IT ALSO COMES HALF A MILLION DOLLARS CONTRIBUTION TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING. $15,000 TO OUR PARKS FUND AS WELL AS CLEANING UP FOUR STORIES WORTH OF CONTAMINATION BELOW THE SITE. WITH NO TAX ABATEMENTS. SO I -- I THINK THESE ARE SMALL AND MODEST CHANGES TO ALLOW SOMETHING THAT WILL BE A COMMUNITY ASSET.
03:04:27.986: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONE.
03:04:31.155: >> Vice Chair Mills: I AGREE THAT THE BENEFITS OF THIS WHEN WE SAW IT FIRST WERE FANTASTIC AND THAT THE CHANGES ARE MODEST. I WOULD SAY THE ONE STICKING POINT I HAD THE FIRST TIME WAS THAT DOOR ON -- ON GLEN, AND SO I THINK THAT'S FANTASTIC. GREAT! I'M GLAD THAT YOU ARE -- YOU KNOW, IT FE FITS WITH THE 40 HE 40 HOTELTHAT'S TAKING OVER. I THINK IT WILL BE SAFER FOR THE PEDESTRIANS AND IT WILL NOT PUT OUT THE CYCLISTS AND TO COME AROUND. I THINK IT'S BETTER TO MOVE THE CLASS B PARKING UP. I THINK IT WILL BE UTILIZED MUCH MORE AT THE STREET LEVEL. I'M EXCITED TO SEE THIS GO
03:05:17.268: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONE R BRIGGS.
03:05:19.203: >> Commissioner Briggs: YES, I HAVE NO CONCERNS. I JUST WANTED TO SAY THANK YOU. WHEN I READ THE CITIZEN PARTICIPATION REPORT AND SAW HOW MANY MEETINGS OCCURRED, IT WAS WONDERFUL TO SEE HOW MANY
03:05:35.253: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONE R HAMMERSCHMIDT.
03:05:39.524: >> Commissioner HAMMERSCHMIDT:  I WAS NOT HERE FOR THE FIRST EDITION OF THE PROJECT. I THINK IT LOOKS GREAT. FOR CLARIFICATION, ARE THESE CHANGES PROPOSED BECAUSE OF THE NEW PARTNERSHIP WITH MARRIOTT? I MIGHT HAVE MISSED THAT.
03:05:51.669: >> IT -- IT'S -- SOME OF THEM. MARRIOTT CAREFULLY REVIEWS THE PLANS. SO SOME OF THE SUGGESTED CHANGES WERE THE RESULT OF SOME OTHER CHANGES OR THINGS THAT WE DID AND SOME CAME FROM THEIR OWN REVIEWS AND AS WE WERE MAKING CHANGES, WE SORT OF INCORPORATED IDEAS LIKE YOURS AND THINGS THAT WE THOUGHT MADE IMPROVEMENTMENTS OVERALL. AND THEN SOME OF THE THINGS REALLY CAME OUT OF ENGINEERING, IN TERMS OF FIGURING OUT WHERE ACTUAL PLACE -- YOU KNOW, THINGS GO IN THE BUILDING AND THAT DISPLACES OTHER THINGS. I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE CREDIT FOR THE BIKE CHANGES AS BEING, YOU KNOW, THOUGHTFUL, BUT THEY WERE PROBABLY LESS THOUGHTFUL AND MORE THE RESULT OF SOMETHING OCCUPYING THE SPACE THAT -- WHERE THEY CAME FROM. SO WE GOT LUCKY THAT IT WAS BETTER. [ LAUGHTER ]
03:06:48.760: >> Commissioner HAMMERSCHMIDT:  THANK YOU.
03:06:52.897: >> SURE.
03:06:53.164: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMI SSIONE R GIBB-RANDALL.
03:06:54.332: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall:  I'M ALSO FULLY IN FAVOR OF THIS AND ONE -- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK WORKS PARTICULARLY WELL IS NOT ONLY IS THE PEDESTRIAN ENTRANCE ORIENTED TOWARDS GLEN BUT THE PART THAT IT OUTLETS ON TO IS THE WIDEST PART OF GLEN. AND THAT WAS OUR BIG ISSUE. IT'S THE ONLY PLACE FOR THE BIKES. THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH ROOM ON GLEN. YOU REALLY CAN'T WIDE YOUR BIKE UP THE STREET, AND I THINK THE WAY YOU ENDED UP RESOLVING ALL OF THIS WORKS WAY MORE ELOQUENTLY AND I'M GRATEFUL THAT YOU -- THAT IT WORKED OUT THIS WAY AND I FULLY SUPPORT IT. SO --
03:07:33.237: >> Chair Milshteyn: SO I WILL JUST ADD MY QUICK TWO CENTS. I'M -- I WAS SUPPORTIVE OF THIS PROJECT PREVIOUSLY AND I'M EVEN MORE SO SUPPORTIVE OF IT TODAY. FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS, EVERY TIME I GIVE A TOUR TO AN INCOMING RESIDENT TO THIS COMMUNITY, I DRIVE THEM BY THERE AND I TELL THEM HOW GREAT IT'S GOING TO BE. [ LAUGHTER ] AND I'M FINALLY HAPPY THAT IT'S ACTUALLY ALL GOING TO HAPPEN. SO THANK YOU FOR ALL THE WORK THAT THE PETITIONER HAS DONE ON THIS. WITHOUT ANY FURTHER COMMENTS, I WILL GO ON TO A VOTE. ALL THOSE IN FAVOR, PLEASE SAY AYE. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. THANK YOU.
03:08:12.577: >> THANK YOU.
03:08:15.913: >> Chair Milshteyn: ALL RIGHT. MOVING ON TO -- [ OFF MICROPHONE COMMENTS ] [ LAUGHTER ]
03:09:17.707: >> Chair Milshteyn: ALL RIGHT. MOVING ON TO THE NEXT ITEM OF OUR AGENDA AND THAT'S 2793 PLYMOUTH ROAD SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE AND SITE PLAN FOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION APPROVAL. WE BEGIN WITH THE PETITIONER PRESENTATION.
03:09:31.355: >> GOOD EVENING, OR SHOULD I SAY GOOD NIGHT. MY NAME IS JACK EDLESTEIN. I'M ONE OF THE OWNERS OF THE PLYMOUTH ROAD PLAZA BUILDING, ALSO KNOWN AS 2793 PLYMOUTH ROAD. AND WE'RE HERE THIS EVENING TO RESPECTFULLY SUBMIT A PETITION TO AMEND THE EXISTING SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE PERMIT FOR THE MEDICAL MARIJUANA PROVISIONING CENTER TO INCREASE IT FROM CURRENTLY PERMISSIBLE 550 SQUARE FEET TO 2,000 # 25 SQUARE FEET. SO A -- 2,725 SQUARE FEET. SO A LITTLE LESS THAN THE DOCUMENT SAYS. THE CURRENT TENANT HAS BEEN THERE FOR ABOUT 18 MONTHS, OPERATING OUT OF A TINY 220 SQUARE FOOT SUITE. WE WANTED TO START OUT SMALL BECAUSE WE DIDN'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THIS INDUSTRY OR THE BUSINESS. WE DIDN'T KNOW HOW IT WOULD AFFECT OUR BUILDING, OTHER TENANTS, CLIENTS, SO WE THOUGHT WE WOULD GIVE IT A TRY ON A SMALL SCALE AND SEE IF IT WORKED. THEN WE COULD EXPAND WHEN ANOTHER SPACE CAME -- BECAME AVAILABLE. WELL, THINGS HAVE GONE IN GENERAL FAIRLY WELL. WE DID LEARN A FEW LESSONS ALONG THE WAY. ONE OF THE THINGS WE DID NOT KNOW WHEN WE BROUGHT IN THIS TENANT WAS THAT IN ADDITION TO THEIR ACTUAL STORE WHERE THEY -- WHERE THE SALES ARE MADE OF THE MEDICAL MARIJUANA PRODUCTS, THERE WAS A REQUIREMENT FOR A WAITING AREA FOR THE PATIENTS WHICH WAS NOT AVAILABLE IN THAT TINY 220 SQUARE FOOT SPACE. THEREFORE, THE EXISTING COMMON LOBBY BECAME THE WAITING AREA FOR THE PATIENTS, WHICH WORKED SOMETIMES BUT OFTENTIMES DURING OVERFLOW HOURS IT DIDN'T WORK VERY WELL AND THERE WERE PEOPLE ACTUALLY ALMOST POURING OUT TO THE STAIRS. THE OTHER ISSUE THAT WE KNEW MIGHT COME UP, BUT DIDN'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW IT WOULD AFFECT US WAS THE ODOR ISSUE, WHICH WAS NOT A BIG DEAL, BUT OCCASIONALLY, IT DID COME UP. AND SO HENCE OUR DESIRE TO MOVE IT TO THE OTHER END OF THE BUILDING, TO A MUCH LARGER SUITE, 2700 SQUARE FEET, THAT WOULD HAVE PLENTY OF SPACE FOR THE LOBBY, WAITING AREA, THE SEPARATE STORE, EVERYTHING THAT'S REQUIRED BY THE STATE FOR THE LICENSING. ALSO, THAT SUITE AS OPPOSED TO THE CURRENT SUITE IS SEPARATE. THE HVAC SYSTEM IS SEPARATED FROM THE -- FROM THE COMMON AREAS. IN OTHER WORDS, THE HVAC SYSTEM THAT CURRENTLY SERVES THE 220 SQUARE FOOT STORE ALSO SERVES THE LOBBY AND THE HALLWAY. SO IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SEPARATE THE ODORS. WITH THIS NEW SUITE, IT WILL HAVE ITS OWN DEDICATED HVAC SYSTEM. WE BROUGHT A VIDEO -- IT'S NOT WORKING. MAYBE WE JUST LOOK AT THE PDFs THEN.
03:12:47.952: >> YES, THIS IS THE SNAPSHOTS.
03:12:55.192: >> SO WE GOT A FEW -- A FEW SLIDES TO PRESENT, THE APPEARANCE, THE LOOK AND THE FEEL OF THE PLACE. WE ARE PLANNING TO INVEST QUITE A BIT INTO THE BUILDOUT AND HAVE US A HIGH QUALITY LOCATION. THIS IS THE HALLWAY LOOKING INTO THE DOOR, ENTRY DOOR DOWN THE HALL. THIS IS INSIDE THE SPACE WITH THE COUNTER. THERE'S THE COUNTER AND THE WAITING AREA. THAT'S THE GLASS WALL THAT'S SEPARATING THE WAITING LOBBY TO THE MEDICAL STORE. YEAH, ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GLASS. GLEN, HEAGAIN, HERE'S THE LOBBY. WE PLAN TO HAVE THE LAPTOPS FOR BASEBPATIENTS TO LOOK AT INFORMN AS THEY ARE WAITING IN THE LOBBY. THIS IS INSIDE THE STORE, THE RETAIL AREA. THERE WILL BE COUNTERS FOR DISPLAY PURPOSES AND FOR SALES. SO THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT FOR OUR PRESENTATION.
03:14:11.135: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU. WE'LL NOW HEAD OVER TO MS. THATCHER FOR A STAFF REPORT.
03:14:16.674: >> THANK YOU. I WOULD JUST LIKE TO ADD THAT THERE ARE NO CHANGES TO THE EXISTING APPROVED SITE PLAN. SO REALLY, THIS IS JUST AN EXPANSION OF AN INTERIOR SPACE. THE PARKING THAT'S EXISTING FOR THIS BUILDING STILL MEETS THE PARKING REQUIREMENTS, EVEN WITH THIS NEW EXPANDED USE. AND STAFF DOES RECOMMEND APPROVAL OF THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE AND SITE PLAN. THANK YOU.
03:14:44.001: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU. I WOULD LIKE TO OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING, IF THERE'S ANYBODY IN THE AUDIENCE WHO WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION, NOW IS YOUR TIME TO STEP UP TO THE PODIUM. STATE YOUR NAME FOR THE RECORD AND YOUR ADDRESS AND ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION FOR UP TO THREE MINUTES. SEEING NO ONE, I WILL CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING AND I WILL READ THE VERY LONG MOTION THAT'S BEFORE US THIS EVENING. THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION AFTER HEARING ALL INTERESTED PERSONS AND REVIEWING ALL RELEVANT INFORMATION, INCLUDING AN ACCOMPANYING SITE PLAN FINDS THE PETITION SUBSTANTIALLY MEETS THE STANDARDS IN CHAPTER 55 ZONING ORDINANCE SECTION 5:104 SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS, AND SECTION 5:50.1 REGULATIONS CONCERNING MEDICAL USE OF MARIJUANA, AND THEREFORE APPROVES THE 2793 PLYMOUTH SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE FOR A MEDICAL MARIJUANA PROVISIONING CENTER. THE APPROVAL IS BASED ON THE FOLLOWING FINDINGS, ONE, THE PROPOSED USE IS CONSISTENT WITH THE C3 FRINGE COMMERCIAL DISTRICT WHICH PROVIDES FOR COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES, RETAIL ESTABLISHMENTS, OFFICES AND PERSONAL SERVICES; TWO, THE PROPOSED USE WILL NOT ADVERSELY IMPACT PEDESTRIANS, BICYCLISTS, CIRCULATION, OR ROAD INTERSECTION BASED ON THE LOCATION PLYMOUTH ROAD PROVIDES ACCESS TO THE SITE AND THE PROPOSED USE IS CONSISTENT WITH THE OTHER SURROUNDING USE IMPACT. THREE, THERE'S AN EXISTING EXCITE PLAN APPROVED BY CITY COUNCIL ON FILING AND PLANNING SERVICES. FOUR, THROUGH DOCUMENTATION SUBMITTED BY THE PETITIONER, INVENTORY TRACKING, SECURITY AND OTHER METHODS OF OPERATION OF THE FACILITIES, THE PROVISOING CENTER WILL BE OPERATED IN A MANNER THAT WILL NOT HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE NEIGHBORING PROPERTIES OR AREA AND WILL NOT HAVE DETRIMENTAL IMPACT ON NATURAL FEATURES. FIVE, THERE'S AN EXISTING APPROVED SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE FOR MEDICAL MARIJUANA PROVISIONING APPROVED FOR MEDICAL MARIJUANA PROVISIONING CENTER APPROVED IN 2018 ON FILE IN PLANNING SERVICES THAT WILL BE AMENDED BY THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE. THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE APPROVAL IS BASED ON THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS. ONE, THE PETITIONER OBTAINING AND MAINTAINING BOTH A STATE OF MICHIGAN MEDICAL MARIJUANA LICENSE, AND, A CITY OF ANN ARBOR MEDICAL MARIJUANA PERMIT, AND PROVIDING DOCUMENTATION SUPPLANTING SERVICES WITHIN THREE YEARS OF THE CITY PLANNING COMMISSION APPROVAL, DATE OF THIS PETITION. TWO, THE PETITIONER OPERATING A MEDICAL MARIJUANA BUSINESS AT THIS ADDRESS WITHIN THREE YEARS OF CITY PLANNING COMMISSION APPROVAL, DATE OF THIS PETITION. THREE, THE SPECIAL EXEMPTION USE MAY OCCUPY NO MORE THAN 2,725 SQUARE FEET OF THE BUILDING. AND THREE, IT SUPERSEDES THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE DATED MAYN ARBOR PLANNING COMMISSION APPROVED THE SITE PLAN WHICH DEMONSTRATES COMPLIANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE EXCEPTION USE STANDARDS AND NO PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE PROPERTY IS PROPOSED. DO I HAVE A COMMISSIONER THAT WILL MONTH OF THAT. MOVED BY MILLS AND SECONDED BY GIBB-RANDALL DO. WE HAVE DISCUSSION? COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL.
03:17:52.689: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall:  PERHAPS STAFF CAN ANSWER THIS. IS THE SITE PLAN KIND OF RECENT ENOUGH THAT THERE'S REASONABLE BIKE PARKING THAT'S ALREADY THERE? I KNOW WITH MANY OF THESE PETITIONS WE ADDED THAT IN. IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S PRETTY RECENT. DID IT COMPLY? LIKE, IS IT KIND OF GENERALLY YOU HAVE TO SNUFF IT TERMS OF HOW WE THINK ABOUT BIKE PARKING NOW?
03:18:13.977: >> YES, IT MEETS CURRENT STANDARDS.
03:18:17.214: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall:  OKAY.
03:18:21.518: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONE.
03:18:22.719: >> Vice Chair Mills: DO WE KNOW IF WE PUT A LIMITATION ON HOURS OR IF WE TALKED ABOUT HOURS?
03:18:27.357: >> LAST TIME THERE WAS NO LIMITATION ON HOURS.
03:18:29.660: >> Vice Chair Mills: OKAY. I JUST WANTED TO SEE IF THAT NEEDED TO BE CARRIED FORWARD BECAUSE IN A COMMERCIAL AREA, WITH VARYING HOURS, YOU KNOW, I DON'T NECESSARILY SEE ANY BUT I WANTED TO VERIFY.
03:18:45.209: >> Chair Milshteyn: AND I THINK THIS WAS ONE OF THE EARLIER ONES AND WE HAD A DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT AND WE DECIDED BASED ON IT BEING NOWHERE NEAR RESIDENTIAL, WE WOULD LET IT OPEN BUT I DID SEE MANY WHERE IN THEIR DOCUMENTATION IT'S -- I THINK IT'S 8 A.M. TO 9 P.M. MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY, AND SATURDAY 10 TO 9, AND SUNDAY 10 TO 6:00 AND THEY PRETTY MUCH FLOWED THE HOURS THAT WE HAVE SEEN IN THE PAST. ANY OTHER DISCUSSION? ALL THOSE IN FAVOR --
03:19:15.606: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall:  HANG ON.
03:19:19.109: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONE.
03:19:20.377: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall:  JUST FOR OUR OWN EDIFICATION, IF YOU COULD COME UP AND TELL US WHAT THE ODOR ISSUE IS. BECAUSE I READ ABOUT THIS BUT NOBODY EVER REALLY TALKS ABOUT IT IN THE REAL AND IT WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL FOR US TO UNDERSTAND AS A COMMISSION WHAT -- WHAT'S GOING ON IN TERMS OF HOW STINKY DOES IT GET. LIKE, WHAT IS IT LIKE? YOU KNOW, WE DON'T KNOW MUCH. SO I WOULD BE CURIOUS TO KNOW WHAT WE ARE PASSING THESE DAYS IN TERMS OF -- WHAT THESE FACILITIES ARE LIKE.
03:19:48.405: >> OKAY. I WILL ANSWER THAT. I WAS REMISS IN NOT INTRODUCING OUR ARCHITECT, WHO PRODUCED THESE DRAWINGS. THE ODOR ISSUE, WHERE IT COMES FROM IS A GOOD QUESTION. IN THE OLD DAYS -- A YEAR AGO, BEFORE THE --
03:20:06.990: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall:  YEAH, RIGHT.
03:20:08.058: >> BEFORE THE CHANGING RULES, VENDORS WERE ALLOWED TO BRING THE PRODUCT, THE FLOWER WE CALL IT INTO THE STORE AND OPEN IT UP AND SHOW IT. BUT THAT IS NO LONGER POSSIBLE. THEY ARE VERY STRICTER PACKAGING GUIDELINES TODAY THAN THEY WERE EVEN A YEAR AGO. NEVERTHELESS, YOU KNOW, THE FLOWER DOES SMELL AND IF SOMEBODY OPENS A PACKAGE INADVERTENTLY, THEN IT'S POSSIBLE FOR IT TO LEAK OUT. I WILL TELL YOU THAT THE -- WE WERE VERY SENSITIVE, BECAUSE THE CURRENT STORE IS RIGHT OVER OUR BIGGEST TENANT, DFCU FINANCIAL. [ LAUGHTER ]
03:20:55.005: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall:  BAD COMBINATION.
03:20:57.441: >> AND DURING THE FIRST SIX MONTHS, I THINK THERE WERE ABOUT THREE COMPLAINTS AND WE EACH TIME TWEAKED THE HVAC SYSTEM AND THERE HAVE NOT BEEN COMPLAINTS IN THE PAST YEAR. SO I THINK IT'S BEEN UNDER CONTROL, BUT -- NOW THAT WE HAVE THE EXTRA PROTECTION OF NOT HAVING OUR -- THAT SUITE SYSTEM FLOW INTO ANY OTHER SPACES OF BUILDING. SO WE DON'T EXPECT THAT IT WILL BE A PROBLEM.
03:21:25.335: >> IF I CAN JUST MAKE A POINT, THOUGH, TO THE PETITION, THAT YOU READ I DIDN'T HEAR SPECIFIC INCREASE -- MAYBE I MISSED IT, INCREASE IN THE SIZE THAT WE'RE ASKING FOR, FROM THE 550 TO THE --
03:21:41.084: >> Chair Milshteyn: THE SPECIAL EXEMPTION USE MAY OCCUPY NO MORE THAN 2,725 SQUARE FEET OF THE BUILDING.
03:21:46.356: >> I MISSED THAT.
03:21:47.557: >> Chair Milshteyn: AND FURTHER IT SUPERSEDES THE APPROVAL FROM MAY 5th, 2018.
03:21:52.396: >> OKAY.
03:21:54.598: >> Chair Milshteyn: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL RIGHT. ALL THOSE IN FAVOR, PLEASE SAY AYE. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. MOVING ON TO ELECTION OF OFFICERS.
03:22:09.446: >> Planning Manager:  THE MOST WONDERFUL TIME OF THE PLANNING COMMISSION YEAR, WHEN YOU ARE GOING TO PICK YOUR LEADERSHIP. THE OFFICERS FOR THE PLANNING COMMISSION AS SPECIFIED IN THE BYLAWS ARE THE CHAIR, THE VICE CHAIR AND THE SECRETARY. THOSE POSITIONS ARE CURRENTLY OCCUPIED BY ALEX AS CHAIR, SARAH MILLS AS VICE CHAIR, AND SHANNAN GIBB-RANDALL AS SECRETARY. THEY ARE ELIGIBLE TO SERVE UP TO ONE MORE YEAR AS THE BYLAWS PROVIDE THAT INDIVIDUALS CAN SERVE IN THOSE OFFICE POSITIONS FOR UP TO A TWO-YEAR PERIOD. AND THIS WOULD BE AN APPROPRIATE TIME FOR A MOTION TO BE MADE TO REUP THEM FOR ANOTHER YEAR OR IF YOU DEEM SOMEBODY ELSE APPROPRIATE FOR THOSE POSITIONS, THEY CAN BE NOMINATED AND VOTED ON INDEPENDENTLY.
03:22:58.762: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONE.
03:23:00.364: >> Commissioner Sauve: I MAKE A MOTION TO NOMINATE THE EXISTING SLATE.
03:23:03.867: >> Chair Milshteyn: DO WE HAVE A SECOND? COMMISSIONER BRIGGS? ANY OTHER NOMINATIONS?
03:23:13.477: >> Planning Manager:  I HAVE THE SECRET P BALLOTS READY, IF YOU WANT TO.
03:23:19.583: >> Chair Milshteyn: SEEING NO OTHER NOMINATIONS, ALL OF THOSE IN FAVOR, PLEASE SAY AYE. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. THANK YOU.
03:23:32.996: >> [ OFF MICROPHONE COMMENT ]
03:23:33.897: >> Planning Manager:  IT'S TOO LATE NOW.
03:23:36.933: >> Chair Milshteyn: ANNUAL REVIEW OF THE CITY PLANNING COMMISSION BYLAWS. WE ONCE A YEAR REVIEW THE BYLAWS AND THEY WERE PROVIDED IN OUR PACKET. I WILL TAKE A MOTION TO APPROVE THE 2019-2020 BYLAWS OF THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION. MOVED BY COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN, SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER BRIGGS. AND WE HAVE DISCUSSION. COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN.
03:24:01.892: >> Councilmember Ackerman: WE CHANGED THE FORMAT OF DEVELOPER PRESENTATIONS, THEN STAFF REPORT AND THEN PUBLIC HEARING AND THEN DISCUSSION. I DIDN'T SEE THAT CAPTURED IN OUR BYLAWS AND I'M WONDERING IF THEY NEED TO BE AMENDED. FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE PUBLIC HEARING PORTION, THERE ARE RULES ABOUT SPEAKERS THAT PERTAIN TO THE PETITIONER, FOR EXAMPLE, FIRST PETITIONER GETS FIVE MINUTES, FOLLOWING REPRESENTATIVES GET THREE, GIVEN THAT THEY NOW HAVE A BULK OF 10 AT THE BEGINNING, DOES THAT NEED TO CHANGE. DO WE NEED TO CODIFY THE NEW FORMAT IN THE BYLAWS, ET CETERA?
03:24:37.027: >> Planning Manager:  I THINK WE SHOULD. I THINK -- WE STARTED THAT, I THINK ON SOMEWHAT OF A TRIAL BASIS TO SEE HOW IT RESONATED.
03:24:44.401: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  I LIKE IT A LOT.
03:24:45.702: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall:  ME TOO.
03:24:47.404: >> Planning Manager:  AND IF THE COMMISSION THINKS IT'S WORKING I THINK IT'S AN EXCELLENT POINT. ANOTHER CHANGE I WAS CONSIDERING BUT I HAVEN'T PROPOSED. IF WE WILL MAKE SOME OTHER EDITS, I WILL THROW IT IN THERE, IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT ARTICULATED IN A FUTURE MEETING FOR CONSIDERATION IS THE NOTION OF REQUIRING AN AFFIRMATIVE VOTE OF 6 COMMISSIONERS TO ADVANCE A PETITION. ONE THE THINGS I WOULD LIKE TO POTENTIALLY CLARIFY IS THAT DOESN'T APPLY TO A POSTPONEMENT. SOMETIMES WE FIND OURSELVES THAT WE DON'T HAVE A QUORUM. WE CAN HAVE A QUORUM OF FIVE TO HOLD THE MEETING, BUT NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE TO CONDUCT BUSINESS. ONE OF THE CHANGES I WAS -- I -- NOT PROPOSING A CHANGE THAT IT WOULD REDUCE THE NUMBER TO ADVANCE ACTION OR A DETERMINATION ON A PETITION BUT THAT IS SORT OF A MORE PROCEDURAL SCHEDULING THING COULD BE DONE ON A SIMPLE MAJORITY. SO IF THAT SEEMS AGREEABLE, MAYBE I WILL PROPOSE THAT CHANGE IN ADDITION NO UPDATING THE PUBLIC HEARING SECTION TO REFLECT OUR CURRENT APPROACH AS WELL. DOES THAT SEEM REASONABLE?
03:25:52.769: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONE?
03:25:53.870: >> Vice Chair Mills: ANOTHER CHANGE THAT I NOTED IS ON PAGE 10, IT'S ARTICLE 10, SECTION 4, WE HAVE RECENTLY BEEN HAVING -- SOMETIMES ALLOW FOR THE PUBLIC COMMENTS TO HAPPEN AT WORKING SESSIONS OR -- OR LIKE ORC MEETING EARLY ON SO WE KNOW WHAT PEOPLE ARE THERE FOR. AS I READ THIS, IT DOESN'T SAY TH WE CAN DO THAT BUT WE WOULD STILL HAVE TO PROVIDE IT AT THE END. I THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR US TO DISCUSS THAT OR IF WE ARE OKAY WITH -- AT THE BEGINNING, JUST BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN EXPERIMENTING AGAIN WITH THAT ONE, I THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD TO GET SOME FEEDBACK ON WHAT WE -- WHERE WE WANT TO GO.
03:26:46.756: >> Chair Milshteyn: SO MY ONLY THOUGHTS SINCE THERE'S NO ACTION TAKEN AT WORK SESSIONS -- IS THAT WHAT YOU ARE REFERRING TO WORK SESSIONS AND ORC.
03:26:58.335: >> Vice Chair Mills: ESPECIALLY WHEN THE ROOM IS FULL.
03:27:03.373: >> Chair Milshteyn: MY ONLY CONCERN IS SPEAKING AT THE BEGINNING ANDEN THE END AND WE ONLY HAVE TWO HOURS ALLOTTED. IT'S A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS. IF WE WALK INTO A ROOM AND IT'S FULL, THEN WE CAN AT THAT POINT -- ONE OF THE COMMISSIONERS CAN MOVE THAT WE MOVE PUBLIC AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION HIGHER ON THE AGENDA VERSUS BEING AT THE END.
03:27:29.299: >> Vice Chair Mills: RIGHT NOW, WE SHOULDN'T BE DOING THAT? SINCE IT'S THE SHALL BE PROVIDED IMMEDIATELY AFTER.
03:27:37.507: >> Planning Manager:  ONE OF THE THINGS I'M THINKING ABOUT AS YOU ARE HAVING THAT DISCUSSION, MAYBE IT SHOULD BE GENERALIZED TO CLARIFY THAT AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION SHALL BE INCORPORATED INTO WORKING SESSIONS AND COMMITTEE MEETINGS. PERHAPS WE CAN DRAFT IT IN SOME WAY THAT JUST MAKES IT CLEAR THAT IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THOSE COMMITTEES TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT OCCURS, BUT IT DOESN'T SPECIFY WHEN SO THAT IT PROVIDES THAT FLEXIBILITIES FOR THE WORKING COMMITTEE OR THE SESSIONS IF IT'S TO HAPPEN AT THE BEGINNING, THE END OR THE POTENTIALLY BOTH. BUT IT SETS THE EXPECTATIONS THAT IT WOULD HAVE TO OCCUR IN THOUGH MEETINGS BUT IT'S NOT PRESCRIPTIVE OF WHEN IT HAPPENS IN THE CONTEXT OF THAT.
03:28:19.115: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONE.
03:28:19.949: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  I WOULD IMAGINE THIS GOES THROUGH THE CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. AND MAKING SURE IT'S IN
03:28:24.988: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONE R BRIGGS.
03:28:29.526: >> Commissioner Briggs: I APPRECIATE THAT WE HAVE BEEN OFFERING THE AUDIENCE AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION AT THE BEGINNING AND I THINK WE HAVE HAD THE BEGINNING AND THE END. I WOULD PERHAPS ENCOURAGE US TO ALWAYS HAVE IT AT THE BEGINNING AND THEN POTENTIALLY IF WE HAVE TIME TO HAVE IT AT THE END AS WELL. THAT'S GREAT, BUT I DON'T SEE ANY BENEFIT OF HAVING AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION SIMPLY AT THE END OF THE MEETING. THAT'S NOT WHY PEOPLE ARE THERE. I MEAN, IT IS -- I HAVE NEVER SEEN IT ACTUALFULLLY SEEN IT INR ORC OR THE P WORK SESSIONS IF ANYTHING, WE CAN TALK LESS AND LISTEN MORE. I WOULD ENCOURAGE THAT TO HAPPEN AT THE BEGINNING.
03:29:18.408: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONE.
03:29:19.309: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall:  I THINK THERE ARE A COUPLE OF REGULARS THAT SHOW UP THAT ARE CURIOUS AND OFTEN COMMENT ON OUR DISCUSSION IN THOUGHTFUL WAYS AND I THINK THEY ARE JUST -- THEY JUST COME BECAUSE THEY ARE INTERESTED. AND I DON'T THINK THAT THEY WOULD NECESSARILY HAVE MUCH TO SAY AT THE BEGINNING. AND -- ANYWAY, I JUST THROW THAT OUT THERE BECAUSE I THINK YOU NO HE WHO I'M TALKING ABOUT AND IT'S ALWAYS REALLY VALUED IN TERMS OF HEARING WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY IN TERMS OF OUR DISCUSSION. SO I WOULDN'T QUITE SEE IT IN SUCH BLACK AND WHITE TERMS IN THOSE WAYS BECAUSE I THINK SOME PEOPLE ARE THERE FOR A CAUSE AND THEY ARE GOING TO SHOW UP FOR JUST THAT MEETING AND THEN THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE THAT ARE VERY INVESTS IN UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S GOING ON WITH OUR BUSINESS, AND HAVE A LOT OF THOUGHTFUL COMMENTS THAT MAKE SENSE AFTER THE DISCUSSION TOO.
03:30:12.128: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONE R BRIGGS.
03:30:13.596: >> Commissioner Briggs: I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH WHAT YOU ARE SAYING AND I THINK THE FLEXIBILITY, I THINK THIS COMMISSION HAS BEEN REALLY RECEPTIVE TO PUBLIC PARTICIPATION. I THINK WE ARE REALLY OPEN TO IT. THE ONLY REASON I AM BRINGING IT UP MORE IS THAT I HAVE BEEN AN OUTSIDER AT OTHER MEETINGS WHERE THE FIRST TIME IN AND YOU JUST DON'T REALIZE THAT YOU CAN EVEN ASK TO CHANGE THE RULES. I THINK THE FIRST-TIME PARTICIPANTS AND PEOPLE COMING FROM OUT OF TOWN, IT'S JUST REALLY NICE TO KNOW THAT IT'S WHEN YOU CAN SPEAK AND HOPEFULLY, YOU KNOW, THAT'S BEGINNING AND END WORKS REALLY WELL. JUST -- I DON'T REALLY CARE EXACTLY HOW, I GUESS. IT'S FINE IF WE DON'T MAKE CHANGES TO THIS. MY POINT IS REALLY MORE FOR THE AGENDAS, IF THE AGENDAS COULD REFLECT THE PUBLIC PARTICIPATION, I THINK THAT WOULD BE GREAT.
03:31:11.554: >> Chair Milshteyn: AND THEN POTENTIALLY THAT THEY CAN OCCUR AT THE CHAIR'S DISCRETION AT WHAT TIME OF THE MEETING AS WELL OR MULTIPLE TIMES DURING MEETING.
03:31:22.165: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall:  SURE, YEAH.
03:31:26.369: >> Chair Milshteyn: IF THERE ARE TEN PEOPLE IN THE ROOM, WE MAY WANT TO HEAR UP FRONT VERSUS WAITING UNTIL LATER. SO DO WE WANT TO POSTPONE THAT.
03:31:36.145: >> Planning Manager:  YES, WE DO.
03:31:38.314: >> Chair Milshteyn: A MOTION TO POSTPONE. MOVED BY MILLS AND SECONDED BY BRIGGS. ALL OF THOSE IN FAVOR OF POSTPONEMENT. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? THEY ARE POSTPONED. WE ARE NOW ON TO AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION. THIS IS THE TIME FOR ANYBODY IN THE AUDIENCE TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION IN REGARDS TO ANY ITEMS. IF THERE'S ANYBODY IN THE AUDIENCE, PLEASE STEP UP TO THE PODIUM AN STATE YOUR NAME FOR THE RECORD AND YOU MAY ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION FOR UP TO THREE MINUTES. SEEING NOBODY, I WILL CLOSE THE AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION AND I WILL MOVE ON TO COMMISSION PROPOSED BUSINESS. IS THERE ANY COMMISSION PROPOSED BUSINESS? IS THERE ANY COMMISSION PROPOSED BUSINESS [ LAUGHTER ] COMMISSIONER MILLS?
03:32:17.553: >> Vice Chair Mills: THERE WERE A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT WERE BOTH IN THE LETTERS TONIGHT AND BROUGHT UP AROUND THIS TABLE THAT WE DON'T NEED TO SOLVE TONIGHT BUT MAYBE WE CAN PUT ON OUR LONG LIST OF THINGS TO DEAL WITH IN WORK SESSION OR ON OUR POTENTIAL, LIKE, FUTURE WORK PLANS. I THOUGHT THERE WERE A COUPLE OF INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE LETTERS THAT CAME THROUGH ABOUT WHAT POLICY LEVERS WE MIGHT BE AI BELIEVE TO USE THAT I WOULD LIKE TO -- ABLE TO USE THAT I WOULD LIKE TO -- SOME OF THEM WERE REALLY LONG. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT COMES UP BEFORE US A LOT. I THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO PING THAT WE GOT A COUPLE OF GOOD LETTERS ABOUT THAT THIS TIME. THERE WAS A LOT OF INTEREST IN -- A COUPLE OF LETTERS ABOUT AIRBNB THAT I KNOW HAS BEEN SORT OF ON OUR -- ON AND OFF OUR WORK PLAN LIST AND I THINK KIND OF -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT PROMPTED THESE. SO GETTING A LITTLE BIT MORE -- DO YOU HAVE MORE DETAIL ON THIS?
03:33:16.913: >> Planning Manager:  CITY COUNCIL HAS DIRECTED STAFF AND YOU TO MAKE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS. SO RIGHT NOW IT'S IN THE STAFF SIDE OF THAT. WE ARE STARTING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE ARE GOING TO APPROACH IT. I CAN TELL FROM MY EXPERIENCE, THE ONE THING I HAVE HEARD MORE AND MORE IS THAT THERE'S A -- AN -- A PERCEIVED ISSUE. I DON'T HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT OUR COMMUNITY GOALS IS AROUND IT. AND SO THAT'S -- THAT'S ONE CHALLENGE. THE SECOND CHALLENGE IS IT'S A PRETTY -- RIGHT NOW, WE ARE LOOKING AT THIS, I GUESS, PHILOSOPHICALLY AS THESE ARE USES THAT ARE PERTINENT TO A RENTAL HOUSE OR AN OWNER OCCUPIED HOUSE AND WE REGULATE THEM IN VERY SPECIFIC WAYS. FOR EXAMPLE, THIS MIGHT BE FIRST TIME THAT WE START REALLY REGULATING OWNER OCCUPIED HOMES IN A SIGNIFICANTLY MORE DETAILED INVASIVE WAY THAN WE HAVE IN THE PAST. SO WE'RE STARTING TO DO SOME RESEARCH ON THAT. ULTIMATELY, I THINK WE ARE GOING TO BE SORT OF PUTTING TOGETHER WHAT OUR ENGAGEMENT PLAN IS TO ANSWER SOME OF THOSE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT AS A COMMUNITY ARE THE CHALLENGES AND WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH BY DOING SOMETHING ABOUT AIRBNBs AND SO ULTIMATELY, THAT WILL COME THROUGH THIS BOARD.
03:34:39.495: >> Vice Chair Mills: WAS THERE A TIME LIMIT THAT THE CITY COUNCIL PUT ON THAT, JUST SO WE GOT SOME CONSE SENSE OF WHEN ITS COMING?
03:34:47.003: >> Planning Manager:  THERE USUALLY IS. I WANT TO SAY LATE SUMMER OR THE FALL, BUT I CAN FOLLOW UP WITH MORE DETAIL.
03:34:53.843: >> Vice Chair Mills: SO SOON THAT WE WILL BE TALKING ABOUT IT.
03:34:56.946: >> Planning Manager:  YES.
03:34:57.780: >> Vice Chair Mills: I HAVE TWO MORE. WE TALKED ABOUT -- A LOT OF THINGS CAME UP. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT COMMISSIONER BRIGGS BROUGHT UP WAS ABOUT REQUIRING SIDEWALKS, LIKE IF WITHIN PRIVATE DEVELOPMENTS THAT THAT IS AN EXPECTATION ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ROAD. AND IF WE CAN JUST VERIFY THAT. ESPECIALLY IF IT'S A PRIVATE ROAD IN THIS CASE. AND THE OTHER ONE IS MORE OF A POINT OF CLARIFICATION. I THINK PROCESSING IT AFTER LIKE THE DISCUSSION. IF A PETITION BEFORE US FOR R1E TODAY, WOULD THEY BE ABLE TO BUILD A BUILDING? THAT -- WOULD THE BASEMENT COUNT TOWARDS THEIR 2,000 SQUARE FEET?
03:35:39.722: >> Planning Manager:  YES.
03:35:41.023: >> Vice Chair Mills: SO IF THEY WANTED -- IN THE FIRST FLOOR AND THE SECOND FLOOR WERE THE SAME FOOT SPRI FOOTPRINT AND THD A FULL BASEMENT, THEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 650. 1300 SQUARE FEET AND THEN THE 650 SQUARE FOOT BASEMENT.
03:35:55.004: >> Planning Manager:  YEP.
03:35:57.073: >> Vice Chair Mills: I'M TOTALLY FINE WITH THAT, BUT IF OTHER PEOPLE AREN'T, THEN WE SHOULD PROBABLY DISCUSS THAT.
03:36:05.214: >> AND W
03:36:08.151: >> Chair Milshteyn: AND WE SHOULD PROBABLY DISCUSS THAT. I DON'T KNOW HOW FEASIBLE IS FOR A BUILDER TO BUILD A 1300 SQUARE FOOT HOUSE AND MAKE IT SO THAT BASED ON OUR LAND COSTS IN THE CITY, AND MAKE THAT WORK FOR THEM. SO SOMETHING TO -- I WOULD PUT IT LOW ON OUR TO-DO LIST. AND THEN JUST ADD A COMMENT IN REGARDS TO AIRBNBs, THIS IS CURRENTLY -- I BELIEVE THERE'S A BILL IN THE MICHIGAN SENATE AND THERE'S A BILL IN THE MICHIGAN HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES THAT THE GOAL, I BELIEVE, FOR BOTH OF THOSE BILLS IS TO BE ON THE GOVERNOR'S DESK AT THE END OF THIS SESSION. THAT IT WOULD HAVE TO DO WITH AIRBNBs.
03:36:50.026: >> Planning Manager:  YES, THOSE BILLS -- I CAN'T -- I HAVEN'T FOLLOWED THEM AS MUCH THIS YEAR. LAST YEAR, SIMILAR BILLS WERE PROPOSED AND THEY WOULD PROHIBIT COMMUNITIES FROM ENACTING REGULATIONS TO REGULATE THEM.
03:37:03.105: >> Chair Milshteyn: YEAH. AND FROM WHAT MICHIGAN REALERS, MICHIGAN ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS ARE SAYING, IT'S LOOKING GOOD THIS YEAR. BUT THEY SAID THE SAME THING LAST YEAR. IT LOOKS LIKE --
03:37:17.853: >> Planning Manager:  THE REALTORS WOULD LIKE IT ADOPTED.
03:37:22.758: >> Vice Chair Mills: CORRECT. IT'S LOOKING GOOD THAT THERE'S SUPPORT -- THERE'S BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE AND ALSO WITH THE GOVERNOR. THAT'S TO NOT REGULATE. SO THERE ARE MUNICIPALITIES -- FOR EXAMPLE, I BELIEVE I WAS READING ABOUT LUDINGTON. LUDINGTON DOES NOT ALLOW ANY LEASES, ANY SHORT-TERM LEASES. AND THAT, YOU KNOW -- AND THEN YOU HAVE COMMUNITIES NEARBY THAT DO ALLOW SHORT-TERM LEASES. AND IT'S A STUDY ON PROPERTY VALUES. THAT WAS THE REPORT THAT I WAS READING. PROPERTY VALUES IN LUDINGTON VERSUS ANOTHER CITY THAT'S NEARBY. I CAN'T REMEMBER THE EXACT CITY, AND HOW THAT IMPACTS PROPERTY VALUES AND HOMEOWNERSHIP RIGHTS.
03:38:05.935: >> Councilmember Ackerman: I'M GLAD THAT STRIPPING LOCAL CONTROL IS A BIPARTISAN ISSUE. [ LAUGHTER ]
03:38:15.511: >> Chair Milshteyn: TOUGH CROWD, OH, BOY! COMMISSIONER BRIGGS.
03:38:20.750: >> Commissioner Briggs: SINCE WE ARE MAKING A LAUNDRY LIST, I THINK THIS IS ON, THERE BUT SINCE WE ARE ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT WHICH TREES ARE GETTING PROTECTED. I DON'T KNOW IF THE -- IF -- THERE HAS BEEN DISCUSSION IN THE PAST ABOUT, YOU KNOW,
