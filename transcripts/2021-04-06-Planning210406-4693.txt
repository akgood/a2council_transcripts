I'LL PROBABLY BE WORKING WITH THE CHAIR TO FINALIZE THAT ENDA IF IT PROCEEDS, AND THEN JUST AS A REMINDER I'LL COVER THIS ALSO IN FUTURE PUBLIC HEARINGS BUT WE HAVE A JOINT SESSION WITH THE SANITATION COMMISSION ON APRIL 20 TO CONSIDER AN UPDATE TO THE MASTER PLAN ADOPTION — [AUDIO CUTTING OUT] MASTER PLAN THAT'S ALL.
00:05:41.081: >> VERY GOOD.  DO ANY OTHER COMMISSIONER OFFICERS OR COMMUNITY LIAISONS HAVE ANYTHING TO REPORT?  IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE OUR LAST PUBLIC MEETING FOR THIS. THE ORC DID MEET TWO WEEKS AGO AND WE DISCUSSED THE ITEMS THAT ARE BEFORE US TODAY AND I FEEL LIKE MAYBE THERE WAS ALSO SOMETHING ABOUT THE PLAN, THE TABLE ASSOCIATE, THANK YOU, COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT, IN TERMS OF THE SITE PLAN APPROVAL PROCESS.  WE'LL GO INTO THAT. ALL RIGHT. WE WILL MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER 7 THEN, WHICH IS OUR PUBLIC COMMENT.

WE'LL GIVE IT A MINUTE FOR THE TV DELAY.
00:08:08.161: >> I SEE NO INDICATION.
00:08:09.329: >> ALL RIGHT. SO WE WILL CLOSE TS OPPORTUNITY FOR PUBLIC COMMENT AND MOVE TO ITEM 8 WHICH IS THE PUBLIC HEARINGS FOR THE NEXT BUSINESS MEETING.
00:08:19.706: >> UM, AS I INDICATED BEFORE, WE HAVE ONE NEW PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULED FOR OUR NEXT BUSINESS MEETING ON APRIL 20.  IT IS AN AMENDMENT TO THE CITY MASTER PLAN FOR THE ADOPTION OF THE ANN ARBOR MOVING TOGETHER TOWARDS VISION ZERO CITY OF ANN ARBOR COMPREHENSIVE TRANSPORTATION PLAN IN i ACCORDANCE WITH THE MICHIGAN PLANNING.
00:08:39.059: >> VERY GOOD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ALL RIGHT. ON TO ITEM 9 THIS IS T PETITION FOR 614 SOUTH ASHLEY STREET ADDITION TO R CITY COUNCIL AROVAL.ND THIS IS UNDERSTANDING ITHAT THE ISOT A PITIO OF ESENTATION TONIGHT SO WE'LL START WITH, THEN OPEN IT UP FOR THE PUBLIC HERRING, AND THEN PLANNING COMMISSION DISCUSSION.
00:09:11.458: >> THANK YOU GIVEN THE LIMITED NATCH OF THE SCOPE OF THE NEXT TWO PROJECT WHEEZE HAD STAFF PREPARE A RELATIVELY SIMPLE PRESENTATION. AT THIS TIME I'M GOING TO TRY AND SHARE MY SCREEN WHICH HOPEFULLY WORKS VERY SMOOTHLY. AND CAN PEOPLE SEE THE SCREEN? ALL RIGHT. SO, AND SORRY... THERE WE GO. OKAY, SO 614 SOUTH ASHLEY IS HERE TODAY BEFORE YOU, THEY ARE REQUESTING FROM A SITE PLAN APPROVAL ULTIMATELY FROM CITY COUNCIL FOR 200, IT IS A 289 SQUARE-FOOT ADDITION OFF THE REAR OF THE EXISTING BUILDING. YOU SEE THE BUILDING OUTLINED IN YELLOW THERE. ON THE LEFT FOR THE AERIAL PHOTO SOME ADDITIONAL CONTEXT IS THE WASHENNA, YOU CAN SEE IT'S A COUPLE OF DOORS DOWN FROM THAT. IF YOU LOOK AT THE ZONING ON THE RIGHT, PROPERTY C TO B A COMMERCIAL MIXED USE DISTRICT DIRECTLY ADJACENT TO THE WEST IS R2A, A DUPLEX RESIDENTIAL ZONING DISTRICT.  THE REASON THIS IS BEFORE YOU TONIGHT IS BECAUSE IT'S A SITE PLANNED FOR A BUILDING OTHER THAN A SINGLE A FAMILY RESIDENTIAL - - I'M SORRY, IT'S ANYTHING BUT A SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENTIAL INCLUDES SITE PLANNING AT CITY COUNCIL, FOR CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL ON A COMMERCIALLY ZONED PROPERTY. ROUND ABOUT WAY, BASICALLY, IT'S BECAUSE EVEN IF IT'S A RESIDENCE, IT'S IN A COMMERCIALLY ZONED PROPERTY, IT REQUIRES A SITE PLAN FOR CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL. NEXT SLIDE.  THE SITE PLAN, YOU CAN SEE THE KIND OF DARK LINED AREA OVER HERE IS THE PROPOSED BUILDING ADDITION.  IT IS DIRECTLY OVER A COUPLE OF THE PARKING SPACES AND THERE'S ALSO A DECK THAT EXTENDS KIND OF OFF THE REAR OF THAT. SO IT IS ONLY A SECOND STORY ADDITION. AGAIN, UNDERNEATH THAT, THOSE THREE PARKING SPACES TOTAL ON THE SITE, THERE IS ONE EB PARKING SPACE REQUIRED AND THEY HAVE INSTALLED IT LOCATED IN THIS AREA HERE. THEY ALSO ARE INSTALLING A BIKE HOOP UP FRONT NEAR THE SIDEWALK WHICH COUNTS AS THE TWO REQUIRED BICYCLE PARKING SPACES.  SO THERE WERE A COUPLE OF OTHER ITEMS ON THIS SITE THAT WERE TAKEN CARE OF BEFORE I CAME TO YOU. FIRST OF ALL, IT IS IN THE HISTORIC DISTRICT SO IT DID REQUIRE HISTORIC DISTRICT APPROVAL, WHICH IT DID RECEIVE IN NOVEMBER OF LAST YEAR. SO NOVEMBER OF 20. THERE'S ALSO, EXCUSE ME, A REQUIREMENT WITH ANY OF THE SITE PLANS FOR CONFLICTING LAND USE BUFFERS WHEN YOU HAVE PROPERTIES ADJACENT TO SOMETIMES OTHER SIMILAR ZONED PROPERTIES BUT THE CONFLICTING LAND USE BUFFER IS REQUIRED WHICH IS A 15-FOOT WIDE VEGETATIVE BUFFER STRIP. SO OBVIOUSLY ON THIS PROPERTY, PARTICULARLY TO THE SOUTH, YOU CAN SEE THERE IS A SHARED DRIVEWAY WHICH IS A UNIQUE - - IT'S NOT TOO UNIQUE, BUT IT'S A FEATURE OF THE SITE WHICH PRECLUDES ANY KIND OF CONFLICTING LAND USE BUFFER ALONG THAT SOUTHERN SIDE. DUE TO SOME OF THE AREA AGAIN ALONG THE WESTERN SIDE AS WELL AS THE NORTHERN SIDE TO THE TOP, THE AREA DID NOT ALLOW FOR A FULL 15-FOOT CONFLICTING LAND USE BUFFER AS WELL AS SOME OF THE TREES AND VEGETATION THEY HAVE.  THEY HAVE PLANT IT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE ACCORDING TO OUR LANDSCAPE REVIEWER, ALTHOUGH IT DOESN'T MEET CODE THE ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS DID GRANT THE VARIANCES FOR THE CONFLICTING LAND USE BUFFERS.  SO BASICALLY THAT KIND OF MEETS THE INTENT OF LANDSCAPING CODE AS MUCH AS YOU CAN. SO WITH THAT, AGAIN, I WANT TO MAKE SURE THERE ARE A COUPLE OF LANDMARK TREES ON THE, WELL, ACTUALLY ADJACENT TO THE PROPERTY THAT WILL BE PROTECTED AS KIND OF REQUIRED BY CODE. SOME OF THEM ARE ALREADY COVERED IN MULTIPLE AND IMPERVIOUS SURFACES OVER THE YEARS, THINGS HAVE BEEN PACKED DOWN. AND ALSO THERE IS A SLIGHT REDUCTION OF IMPERVIOUS SURFACE ON THE PARCEL. I THINK IT'S ABOUT A LITTLE OVER, IT'S ABOUT 106 SQUARE FEET. THAT REALLY ADDRESSES ALL OF THE ISSUES FROM OUR SITE PLANNING POINT OF VIEW AND AT THIS TIME STAFF IS RECOMMENDING APPROVAL. THANK YOU.
00:13:17.070: >> MATT, COULD YOU JUST TOUCH ON QUICKLY THE OUTSTANDING REVIEWER COMMENTS THAT WERE LISTED AS THE CONDITIONS.
00:13:24.544: >> SURE. YEAH, THERE ARE SOME REVISIONS THAT WERE NEEDED FOR THE PLANS THAT WERE NOT SHOWN ON THE PREVIOUS PLAN THAT WHAT LIKE WHEN THE REPORT WAS WRITTEN FOR YOU. THERE HAS BEEN A REVISED PLAN THAT WAS UPLOADED SINCE THAT TIME THAT DOES COVER SOME OF THE VEGETATION WAS LEFT OFF. A COUPLE OF THE TREES WERE LEFT OUT OF THE SITE PLANNING BUT THEY WERE ADDED TO THE SUBSEQUENT SITE PLAN. THIS SITE PLAN DOES INCLUDE THOSE TREES THAT WERE NOT INCLUDED THAT WERE MENTIONED AS CONDITIONS.  HOWEVER, IT HAS NOT BEEN FULLY REVIEWED BY THE BUYER LANDSCAPE REVIEWER WE DID A TENTATIVE REVIEW, SO THAT WAS SOMETHING WE WOULD, AND WHERE THINK IT'S STILL IN THE MOTION AS CORRECT, AS BEING RESOLVED BEFORE COUNCIL SCHEDULING AND THAT SHOULD NOT BE AN ISSUE AT THIS TIME. I BELIEVE THAT WAS THE ONLY OTHER OUTSTANDING ISSUE. THERE WAS ONE THING REGARDING MITIGATION CONCERNS THAT THEY NEED TO KNOW DURING CONSTRUCTION WHETHER OR NOT, IF THE EXISTING BUILDING IS CONNECTED TO A FOOTING DRAIN THAT'S CONNECTED TO THAT SO IF THEY REMOVE THAT THEY GET SOME CREDIT TOWARDS SOME MITIGATION CALCULATIONS FOR THAT.  THOSE WERE THE ISSUES.
00:14:32.912: >> I THINK WAS ALSO A REFERENCE TO A WALKWAY BEING TREATED IN SUCH A WAY THAT IT WAS A NON-SLIP. BUT JUST TO ECHO THE COMMENT, THE MOTION DOES REFLECT THAT THOSE ARE BEING AD JUSTED.  WE DON'T ANTICIPATE THAT BEING AN ISSUE WHATSOEVER.
00:14:50.130: >> THERE'S AN ADDITIONAL PAINTING REQUIRED TO CLEAR THE LOCKING WALKWAY, CLEARLY DELINEATE THE WALKWAY FROM ANY TRAVEL THERE. THEY WANTED A TO REQUEST A NON-SLIP, OR A SLIP-RESISTENT MATERIAL. THAT'S CORRECT. THAT CONCLUDES THE REPORT. THANK YOU.
00:15:07.881: >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ALL RIGHT, I WILL NOW OPEN THE PUBLIC HEARING. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PERSONS TO SPEAK FOR UP TO THREE MINUTES ABOUT THE PROPOSALED 614 SOUTH ASHLEY SITE PLAN. PUBLIC COMMENT MAY BE MADE BE CALLING 877-853-5247, AND ENTERING MEETING ID 929 -1620-2435. CITY STAFF WILL SELECT CALLERS THAT HAVE RAISED THEIR HAND ONE BY ONE USING THE LAST THREE DIGITS OF YOUR TELEPHONE NUMBER. IN ORDER TO ELECTRONICALLY RAISE YOUR HAND, YOU PLEASE PRESS STAR 9 ON YOUR PHONE. YOU'LL HEAR AN AUTOMATED ANNOUNCEMENT ONCE THE HOST IS ALLOWING YOU TO SPEAK. WHEN SPEAKING, PLEASE MOVE TO A QUIET AREA, AND MUTE ANY BACKGROUND SOUNDS OR THE TELEVISION SO THAT WE CAN HEAR YOU CLEARLY. PLEASE ALSO STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS AT THE BEGINNING OF YOUR COMMENT. ANYONE ON THE LINE LIKE TO MAKE A COMMENT DURING THIS PUBLIC HEARING? IF SO YOU CAN PRESS STAR 9 ON YOUR PHONE.
00:16:25.158: >> A FEW MORE MOMENTS HERE.
00:16:27.460: >> OKAY. I STEBE Y ANY INDICATION.
00:16:38.338: >> ALL RIGHT.  VERY GOOD. THEN I WILL CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING AND MOVE ON TO THE PROPOSED MOTION. SO I'LL READ IT. THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION HEREPIE RECOMMENDS THAT THE MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL APPROVE THE 614 SOUTH ASHLEY SITE PLAN WITH THE MODIFICATIONS REFLECTING STAFF COMMENTS IN THE STAFF REPORT PRIOR TO SCHEDULING FOR CITY COUNCIL CONSIDERATION. FLUSH. MOVED. MOVED BY COMMISSIONER SAUVE, SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER DISCH. ANY DISCUSSION OF THE PROPOSED MOTION? THIS IS AMONG THE THINGS ON THE LIST FOR CONSIDERATION OF WHETHER THIS IS A SMALL OR MEDIUM PROJECT THAT MAY NOT NEED TO COME BEFORE US IN THE FUTURE. A GOOD RECEMT EXAMPLE, AS WE DISCUSSED THAT, WHEN THAT COMES, WHEN THOSE AMENDMENTS COME BEFORE US IN A COUPLE OF MONTHS.
00:17:36.529: >> AND IT'S LESS THAN 300 SQUARE FEET. INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH, WHICH I DIDN'T EVERY AEN - - THAT WAS THAT NUMBER THAT WE HAD.  GOOD TIMING.
00:17:46.439: >> YEAH. VERY IF. GOOD. COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL.
00:17:55.248: >> COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL: YEAH, JUST ONE THING ABOUT THE LAND LANDSCAPE STUFF.  THE BACK MAKES A LOTS OF SENSE TO ME THEY CRAMMED WHAT THEY CAN IN TERMS OF SCREENING.  AM I SEEING A STORM WATER AREA UP IN THE FRONT? THERE'S SOME SPECIES UP THERE THAT ARE MAKING ME WONDER.  IS THAT STORM WATER UP IN THE FRONT NORTH PART OR NO?
00:18:14.801: >> I WOULD HAVE TO GO, I COULD GO BACK AND CHECK AT THAT PLAN REALLY QUICKLY.  I KNOW THAT AND I DIDN'T GIBB-RANDALL COVER THAT — IT WAS STORM WATER EXEMPT BECAUSE IT'S LESS THAN 5,000 SQUARE FEET. AT LEAST A REPRESENTATIVE IS ON THE LINE, TOO, YOU COULD ASK HIM REALLY QUICK. I KNOW THAT THANK YOU FOR REMINDING ME THAT IT IS EXEMPT FROM STORM WATER BECAUSE OF THE SIZE.
00:18:37.323: >> OKAY, I GUESS I WOULD JUST, AND THIS IS LIKE A PICKY THING THAT I HAVE TO CHANGE IF - - THEY DON'T HAVE TO CHANGE IT IF THEY DON'T WANT TO. USING LIKE A BIG PERENNIAL AREA THAT THEY'RE USING WHICH IS KIND OF A PICKY PLANT SO IT'S JUST NOT SOMETHING YOU NORMALLY SEE IN A SITE PLAN SUBMISSION. IT'S MORE FROZEN MUCH MORE CONSERVATIVE WETLANDS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. SO IT'S UP TO THEM WHETHER THEY WANT TO TRY TO KEEP THOSE ALIVE BUT I WOULD DO SOMETHING A LOT MORE SIMPLE THAN THAT. IF I WERE THEM.  THAT'S WHY I WAS ASKING IF THAT WAS STORM WATER BECAUSE IT'S KIND OF A MOIST, IT'S A WETLAND PLANT. SO AGAIN, THIS ISN'T REALLY CODE-RELATED IT'S MORE LIKE DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GETTING YOURSELF INTO TO KEEP THAT THING ALIVE GIVEN THAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO KEEP THESE THINGS ALIVE OVER TIME.  YOU MIGHT CONSIDER GETTING SOMETHING THAT'S A LITTLE MORE BULLETPROOF THAN A MICHIGAN LILY IS WHAT I WOULD SAY, WHICH HAS QUITE A CONSERVATIVE COEFFICIENT ON IT. I KNOW THEY'RE TIE - - THAT'S ALL I WOULD SAY ABOUT THE LANDSCAPE PLAN.
00:19:49.862: >> THANK YOU. WE'LL NOTE THAT.
00:19:54.700: >> ANYONE ELSE?
00:20:00.173: >> WE'RE READY FOR ROLL CALL VOTE.
00:20:04.243: >> COMMISSIONER ABRONS.
00:20:10.883: >> YES.
00:20:14.921: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT.
00:20:17.890: >> YES.
00:20:18.157: >> COMMISSIONER DISCH.
00:20:19.525: >> YES.
00:20:22.228: >> COMMISSIONER LEE.
00:20:22.695: >> YES, FROM ANN ARBOR.
00:20:25.798: >> COMMISSIONER CLARKE.  YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY THAT EVERY TIME BUT YOU CAN IF YOU WANT TO.
00:20:31.270: >> YES.
00:20:34.140: >> COMMISSIONER MILLS.
00:20:37.577: >> YES.
00:20:38.411: >> COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL I.
00:20:39.412: >> YES.
00:20:41.113: >> COMMISSIONER SAUVE.
00:20:43.216: >> YES.
00:20:43.483: >> CARRIES UNANIMOUSLY.
00:20:44.350: >> VERY GOOD.
00:20:45.384: >> ALL RIGHT, THE NEXT ITEM OF REGULAR BUSINESS IS 9B, AND I WILL KIND OF INTRODUCE IT WHILE WE'RE MOVING PEOPLE IN AND OUT. THIS IS THE 2898PACKARD PETITION FOR EXTRAORDINARY INDIVIDUALS CHILD CARE CENTER SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE FOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION APPROVAL.  FLUSH. SO THIS ONE SEEMS TO BE ONE THAT STOPS WITH US. IT IS NOT A RECOMMENDATION FOR CITY COUNCIL. SLIDES PULLED UP.
00:21:24.657: >> YEAH, SO THAT'S CORRECT.  I WAS GOING TO REMIND THE COMMISSION THAT THIS IS A SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE ONLY. THERE IS NO SITE PLAN ASSOCIATE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS PROJECT. IF IT WOULD BE TO BE APPROVED TONIGHT THIS IS THE FINAL STEP THAT IS REQUIRED. SO AGAIN, A HIGHLIGHT ON THE SITE HERE, YOU CAN SEE ON THE LEFT IS THE AERIAL PHOTO THAT THE CHURCH BUILDING IS OBVIOUSLY NEAR THE TOP OF THAT ADJACENT TO PACKARD WND IT'S A CPLEF ACROSS T STREET LIKE BLOCK DOWNOUNTY FARM PARKND OBVIOUSLY THIS IS AS AD JASON TO MARY BETH DOYLE PARK, AND CREEK RUNS THROUGH THE PROPERTY THERE, TO THE REAR. ZONING LICENSE, R1C, SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENTIAL. DAY CARE IS AN ALLOWED USE, WELL IT'S AN ALLOWED USA THROUGH - - ALLOWED THROUGH SPECIAL EXEMPTION. WHAT IS REQUIRED FOR SPECIAL EXCEPTION WHEN THERE'S NO EXTERIOR IMPROVEMENTMENTS PROPOSED. THEY'RE ALLOWED TO SUBMIT PREVIOUSLY APPROVED SITE PLANS VERIFYING STAFF HAS VERIFIED SO WHAT WE'RE HERE TONIGHT THE PETITIONER IS REQUESTING SPECIAL EXCEPTION APPROVAL 9 TO 6ISH OPERATION OF THE MAXIMUM OF 60 CHILDREN. NO EXTERN I IMPROVEMENTS AT THIS TIME, AND SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE IF RECOMMENDED THAT WOULD BE THE FINAL ACTION AND THERE ARE NO OUTSTANDING STAFF ISSUES ON THIS ONE. SO STAFF IS RECOMMENDING APPROVAL. THANK YOU. VERY GOOD.
00:23:03.856: >> VERY GOOD. NOW I'LL OPEN THE PUBLIC HEARING. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PERSONS TO PEEK FOR UP TO THREE MINUTES ABOUT THE PROPOSED CHILD CARE CENTER SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE PERMIT -T 2898PACKARD ROAD. PUBLIC COMMENT MAY BE MADE BE CALLING (877)853-2547 AND ENTERING MEETING ID 929-1620-2435, CITY STAFF WILL CALL ON, WILL SELECT CALLERS THAT HAVE RAISED THEIR HAS BEENS. YOU DO THAT BY PRESSING STAR 9 ON YOUR TONE PHONE. YOU'LL HEAR AN AUTOMATED MESSAGE THAT THE HOST IS ALLOWING YOU TO PEEK AND WE'LL CALL OUT THE LAST THREE DIGITS OF YOUR TELEPHONE NUMBER. PLEASE MOVE TO A QUIET AREA, MUTE ANY BACKGROUND SOUNDS INCLUDING TELEVISION, AND PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS FOR THE RECORD.
00:23:54.607: >> CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 604. CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 604, YOU UNMUTE YOUR PHONE AND HAVE THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE COMMISSION.
00:24:03.816: >> HELLO, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
00:24:06.619: >> WE CAN.
00:24:06.919: >> OH, GREAT. WONDERFUL. MY NAME IS STEVEN, I AM A NEIGHBOR OF THE SITE AT 2885 BUTTERNUT STREET. I AM ALSO A FORMER PLANNING COMMISSIONER AND CITY COUNCIL MEMBER SO I JUST WANT TO SAY HOW MUCH I APPRECIATES YOUR SERVICE AND THANK YOU. I AM CALLING IN TO SUPPORT THIS SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE PERMIT.  I ATTENDED THE COMMUNITY MEETING THAT THE PETITIONER HELD A FEW MONTHS AGO AND GOT INFORMED ABOUT THE PROJECT. I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S PROBABLY AT LEAST TWO CHILD CARE FACILITIES THAT CLOSED ON EITHER SIDE OF THE SITE ALONG PACKARD, ONE CLOSER TO PLATT AND ONE CLOSER TOWARDS EISENHOWER. I THINK THIS SITE IS VERY BENEFICIAL TO THE EAST ANN ARBOR, IT'S CENTRALLY LOCATED, THERE'S A LOT OF APARTMENTMENT COMPLEXES WITH CHILDREN THAT I'M SURE WILL BE ABLE TO UTILIZE THIS FACILITY.  IT'S ALSO MENTIONED IN THE SITE REPORT OR THE STAFF REPORT ADJACENT TO MARY BETH DOYLE PARK.  IT'S RIGHT NEXT DOOR WHICH I THINK IS JUST GREAT FOR THE LITTLE CHILDREN TO HAVE OPPORTUNITIES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION, NATURE WALKS, ET CETERA, AND THERE'S ALSO A PLAYGROUND ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STORM POND. I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S ANY TRAFFIC CONCERNS. I THINK THAT GIVEN IT IS A CHURCH AND HAS REGULAR USE AS A HOUSE OF WORSHIP, TRAFFIC HASN'T BEEN ANY PROBLEM AT ALL FROM WHAT I CAN TELL. SO, AGAIN, I'M JUST CALLING TO SAY I'M GIVING MY SUPPORT AND I THINK THE PETITIONER'S A GREAT PERSON WHO'S GOING TO RUN A GREAT OPERATION AND OUR COMMUNITY WILL BENEFIT FROM THIS APPROVAL. THANK YOU. BYE-BYE.
00:25:54.693: >> THANK YOU. IF ANY OTHER CALLERS WISH TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION COMMISSIONER DISCH THIS ITEM PLEASE - - ON THIS ITEM PLEASE PRESS STAR 9 TO RAISE YOUR HAND.
00:26:14.480: >> HAD SEEING NONE.
00:26:15.548: >> THEN I WILL CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING AND READ THE PROPOSED MOTION. WHICH HAS A COUPLE OF PARTS. IT'S ALL ONE BUT IT'S JUST LONG AS SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE PERMITS ARE. THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION AFTER HEARING ALL INTERESTED PERSONS AND REVIEWING ALL RELEVANT INFORMATION FINDS THE PETITION TO SUBSTANTIALLY MEET THE STANDARDS IN CHAPTER 55 UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE SECTION 5.29.5 SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE. AND THEREFORE APPROVES THE EXTRAORDINARY INDIVIDUALS SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE FOR A CHILD DAYCARE. THIS APPROVAL IS BASED ON THE FOLLOWING FINDINGS. ONE, THE PROPOSED USE WILL BE CONSISTENT WITH THE R1C SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT WHICH PROVIDES FOR RELATED ACTIVITIES INCLUDING RELIGIOUS ASSEMBLY, AND DAYCARE SERVICES. TWO, THE PROPOSED USE WILL NOT ADVERSELY IMPACT TRAFFIC, CIRCULATION OR STREET, AND ROAD INTERSECTION BASED ON THE LOCATION. PACKARD ROAD PROVIDES ACCESS TO THE SITE, AND CONSISTENT WITH SURROUNDING TRAFFIC IMPACT. THREE, THERE IS AN EXISTING SITE PLAN APPROVED BY CITY COUNCIL IN 2000, ON FILE IN PLANNING SERVICES. THIS SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE APPROVAL IS BASED ON THE FALLOWING CONDITION. ONE, A MAXIMUM OF 60 CHILDREN. AND THAT THE ANN ARBOR PLANNING COMMISSION APPROVED THE PLAN AS NO PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE PROPERTY IS PROPOSED. CAN I HAVE A COMMISSIONER MOVE THAT THIS, MOVED BY COMMISSIONER SUAVE, SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER DISCH.  ANY DISCUSSION OF THE PROPOSED MOTION.
00:28:01.754: >> COMMISSIONER SAUVE:  IS IT TYPICAL WE PUT THE BUSINESS NAME AND NOT THE ADDRESS IN THE MOTION?  AND WOULD THERE BE, IF THERE'S A DIFFERENT BUSINESS NAME?
00:28:12.998: >> THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE IS ASSIGNED TO THE ADDRESS ONCE IT'S APPROVED.  BUT YOU COULD ADD THE ADDRESS IN THERE. THERE'S BEEN MULTIPLE WAYS OF DOING IT.  WE COULD ADD THE MOTION INTO THE MOTION IF YOU'D FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE THAT WAY.
00:28:26.612: >> I THINK THAT WOULD IMPROVE IT. I WOULD SUGGEST MODIFYING IT TO BE APPROVE THE EXTRAORDINARY INDIVIDUAL SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE ACT 2898PACKARD ROAD.
00:28:41.627: >> IS THIS ONE WE CAN DO AS A FRIENDLY THING?
00:28:43.829: >> AN ADDITION?
00:28:45.164: >> OR DO YOU WANT A FORMAL...
00:28:48.067: >> IF IT'S FRIENDLY WITH COMMISSIONER SAUVE AND DISCH, I'M FINE WITH IT.
00:28:56.175: >> GREAT.
00:28:56.475: >> THAT WAS IT.
00:28:57.810: >> THANK YOU.
00:28:58.177: >> THANKS.
00:29:03.382: >> IN ADDITION TO UNDERSCORING THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING DAYCARE FACILITIES IN THIS GROWING CITY, I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT THIS IS A FANTASTIC USE OF PARKING THAT OTHERWISE SITS IDLE.  THESE ARE EXTREMELY COMPLEMENTARY USES AND I THINK THIS IS EXACTLY THE SORT OF THING WE OUGHT TO SEE MORE OF. OR THAT I'D LIKE TO SEE MORE OF. THERE WAS ONE QUESTION THAT I HAD ABOUT THE SITE PLAN AND ON THE SITE PLAN I THINK IT'S TO THE WEST THERE WAS SHOWN A PLAY AREA. JUST IN THE AERIAL PHOTOS AND STREET VIEW, IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE I WENT TO MARY BETH DOYLE, I'M CURIOUS IF THERE IS AN OUTDOOR PLAY AREA THAT'S PLANNED THERE. I KNOW IT'S ADJACENT TO THE PARK, BUT ESPECIALLY FOR DAYCARE THAT CAN BE A - -
00:29:51.296: >> I DID, YOU'RE RIGHT ON THAT PLAN THERE, BUT IT'S NOT I THINK ORIGINALLY ON THE PLAN.  THE PETITIONER IS ON THE LINE SO WE COULD ASK HER, MS. ALLEN, IF SHE HAS PLANS TO UTILIZE THAT AREA AND IMPROVE THAT.
00:30:06.512: >> YEAH, I WOULD LOVE THAT.
00:30:11.316: >> OKAY. MS. ALLEN IF YOU CAN UNMUTE YOUR PHONE OR COMPUTER OR... MAYBE. THERE WE GO.  GOOD EVENING.
00:30:23.796: >> I WAS CLOSING MY BACKGROUND SOUNDS. WE HAVEN'T HAD ANY SET PLANS YET.  WE HOPE TO IN THE FUTURE BUT JUST AS OF NOW WE WANTED TO GET AT LEAST A DAYCARE STARTED AND SEE WHAT WE CAN DO AS FAR AS PLAYGROUND AND EQUIPMENT THINGS.
00:30:40.012: >> OKAY.  GREAT. I, YOU KNOW, HAVING STILL KIDS IN DAYCARE, I KNOW LIKE HAVING AN OUTDOOR SPACE TO RUN AROUND AND BEING RIGHT ADJACENT TO THE PARK IS FANTASTIC.  I HOPE THAT THAT, YOU KNOW, THE FENCED IN AREA IS ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD. AND JUST THE QUESTION FOR STAFF THAT IT'S SHOWN ON THE SITE PLAN. THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO OUTFIT THAT WITHOUT COMING BACK AND HAVING ANY ADDITIONAL - -
00:31:06.105: >> IT'S NOTHING THAT, CORRECT. ALL THAT WORK WITHIN THERE, AGAIN, IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WOULD TRIGGER A SITE PLAN NORMALLY.  IF THEY HAD PLAYGROUND EQUIPMENT AND IF THEY START PAVING THE WHOLE THING OVER, THAT'S A DIFFERENT STORY BUT THEY WOULDN'T DO THAT FOR A PLAY AREA SO.  YEAH.  SO THAT WOULD BE PERFECTLY ACCEPTABLE TO COME BACK AND IMPROVE THAT AREA. EVEN ACTUALLY THEY CAN EXPAND THAT AREA WITH FENCING AND THINGS LIKE THAT, THAT WOULD BE THE ONLY THING NECESSARY IF THEY WANT TO GROW A LITTLE BIT LARGER FOR THAT EX TEAR I PLAY AREA. THAT WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE AS WELL.  IT DOESN'T TRIGGER ANY SITE PLANNING ACTION IF THEY ENLARGE THE PLAY AREA OUTSIDE.
00:31:40.839: >> VERY GOOD. BEST OF LUCK TO YOU. AND I HOPE THAT YOU HAVE YOUR 60 ENROLLED KIDS AND ARE ABLE TO MAKE THE OUTDOOR AREA HAPPEN.
00:31:53.952: >> THANK YOU. SUPER EXCITED.
00:31:59.258: >> ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS? ALL RIGHT, MR. LEONARD, I THINK WE'RE READY FOR ROLL CALL VOTE.
00:32:09.334: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT.
00:32:13.539: >> YES.
00:32:13.805: >> COMMISSIONER DISCH.
00:32:19.278: >> YES.
00:32:19.545: >> COMMISSIONER LEE.
00:32:23.382: >> YES.
00:32:23.649: >> COMMISSIONER CLARKE.

00:32:39.164: >> YES.
00:32:39.431: >> IT'S APPROVED. VERY GOOD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ALL RIGHT. NEXT ITEM IS 9C, WHICH IS THE AMENDMENT TO CHAPTER 55 UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE, TO CREATE A NEW ZONING DISTRICT FOR TRACTION -T CORER TORES AND THIS WOULD BE FOR CITY COUNCIL APPROVE APPROVAL. WE ARE, I SEE MR. LEONARD IS MOVING STAFF AROUND.  WE'LL START WITH THE STAFF PRESENTATION BY MR. LEO, AND THEN WE WILL OPEN IT UP FOR THE PUBLIC HEARING. THOSE WHO HAVE JOINED VIA PHONE, UM, WE'LL MOVE TO YOU ONCE WE HEAR THE STAFF REPORT. COMMISSIONER LEE.
00:33:20.639: >> HI. I'M JUST GOING TO RECUSE MYSELF FROM THIS AND I WILL BE LISTENING FROM THE PUBLIC.
00:33:28.046: >> ALL RIGHT, VERY GOOD.

00:33:50.802: >> 6.  OKAY.  EXCELLENT.
00:34:00.579: >> WE'VE ALSO INVITED MATT CARPENTER FROM THE RIDE SHOULD ANY QUESTIONS ARISE REGARDING TRANSIT SERVICE SO HE IS WAITING FOR ANY QUESTIONS THAT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO ADDRESS AND WITH THAT ALEXIS, TAKE IT AWAY.
00:34:19.264: >> SURE. THANK YOU. JUST WAITINGOR MY RED B T SHOW U E YOU SEEG THELIDE SHO CURSER MOUSE MOVING AROUND TOO. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU. I WILL BE PRESENTING I WILL KEEP IT AS BRIEF AS I CAN, NOT MY STRONG SUIT, ABOUT AN AMENDMENT TO THE UDC UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE TO CREATE AND ESTABLISH A NEW ZONING DISTRICT. WE'VE CHOSEN THE NAME TC1 FOR TRANSIT CORRIDOR DISTRICT. IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I'M NOT GOING TO GO OVER THE STAFF REPORT IN ITS ENTIREY.  I'M GOING TO RELY ON THE MASTER PLAN REVIEW THAT'S IN THE STAFF REPORT AND I WILL NOT ADDRESS THAT IN THE PRESENTATION. INSTEAD I'M JUST GOING TO FOCUS ON WHAT THE PROPOSED LANGUAGE IS. OBVIOUSLY HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS, BUT IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I'M GOING TO JUMP RIGHT INTO THE PROPOSED ORDINANCE. I HAVE A TOOL BAR HERE THAT I NEED TO SOME HOW MOVE. OKAY. SO IN THE PROPOSED ORDINANCE WE ARE INSERTING AN INTENT STATEMENT. IT WILL BE SECTION 59129.  THAT A GENERAL STATEMENT THAT DESCRIBES THE WHY, WHY AND WHAT IS THIS DISTRICT FOR. THERE IS A SPECIFIC PURPOSE STATEMENT. THIS IS THE WHERE TO USE IT, WHEN TO USE IT CRITERIA TO HELP GUIDE THE PLANNING COMMISSION AND STUDENT COUNCIL. WE DESCRIBED THE PROPOSED DISTRICT SHOULD PLACE THE O OFFICE RE RESEARCH, ORL OFFICE RESEARCH LIGHT INDUSTRIAL LOGICAL, C2B, THIS IS THE SERVICE. C3, AND M1 DISTRICTS. IT SHOULD FRONT ON A TRANSIT CORRIDOR, AND WE'VE IDENTIFIED FOUR AREAS THAT MEET THE GENERAL AND SPECIFIC INTENTS OF THIS DISTRICT. WE ALSO INDICATE THAT THERE MIGHT BE OTHER AREAS THAT MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE. AND HERE'S THE GUIDELINES THAT SHOULD BE USED TO APPLY IT. ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE SCREEN ARE THE AREAS THAT ARE CURRENTLY ZONE C3 FRINGE COMMERCIAL, RIGHT SIDE ARE THE AREAS CURRENTLY ZONED C2B, BUSINESS SERVICE. LEFT SIDE OF THIS SLIDE HAS OZONING, OFFICE, CURRENTLY, AND THE RIGHT SIDE HAS ORL, WHERE YOU'LL FIND THOSE CURRENTLY. LEFT SIDE HAS LIMITED INDUSTRIAL, THE M1 DISTRICT AND THE RIGHT SIDE OF THIS IS WHERE WE FIND THE EXISTING RE RESEARCH DISTRICT. OF THE AREAS THAT WE SAY THAT ARE APPROPRIATE FOR THIS DISTRICT, TC1, ARE THE EISENHOWER AREA. IT'S OUTLINED IN PINK AND THIS IS THE CURRENT ZONING OF IT. THE PURPLE IS O OFFICE, AND THE RED IS C3.  THAT'S WHAT YOU'LL MOSTLY FIND HERE IN THE EISENHOWER TARGET AREA. THIS IS AN AERIAL PHOTO OF GIBB-RANDALL FROM A HIGH-LEVEL. THE WHERE THE PROPOSED TC1 DISTRICT IS APPROPRIATE IS OUTLINED IN PINK, MAGENTA. WHAT YOU MIGHT NOTICE THERE IS THERE'S A LOT OF PARKING LOTS IN THIS AREA, AND THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF FRONT YARD, AND THAT'S WHERE WE'RE HOPING THE REDEVELOPMENT AND INFILL WILL OCCUR. THERE'S SOME MUSTARD K-LAR THAT'S PUD, AND ONE PARCEL OF O, ONE PARCEL OF R4B. THE AERIAL PHOTO OF THAT AREA, LESS FRONT YARDS COMPARED TO STATE AND EISENHOWER, BUT YOU'LL NOTICE RIGHT AWAY ALL THE PARKING LOTS. THAT'S GOT A LOT OF REDEVELOPMENT POTENTIAL. ALSO THIS AREA IS NOT EXCLUSIVELY, BUT QUITE PREDOMINANTLY ONE STORY. THIS IS A WEST STADIUM TARGET AREA. THERE'S A LITTLE BUT OF M1 IN PURPLE HERE AND A LITTLE BIT OF OFFICE THAT'S A DIFFERENT SHADE BUT SIMILAR PURPLE AND THIS IS THE AIR PHOTO SIMILAR 250WACHINA. YOU'LL SEE A LOT OF SURFACE PARKING HERE. NOT QUITE AS VAST AND NOT SO MUCH FRONT YARD. THIS IS THE PLYMOUTH TARGET ROAD AREA, CURRENT ZONING, THERE'S ORL IN PURPLE HERE OFFICE, NC3, A LITTLE BIT OF C1 AND C1B AS WELL. THIS IS THE AERIAL PHOTO IT HAS SORT OF A MIX BETWEEN LARGE PARKING LOTS AS WELL AS FRONT YARD THAT HAVE REDEVELOPMENT AND INFILL POTENTIAL. THIS IS JUST ONE SCREEN OF THE PRIMARY USE TABLE AGAIN AS PART OF THE ORDINANCE AMENDMENTS WE ARE INSERTING OUR COLUMN INTO THE TABLE. YOU CAN SEE IT'S HIGHLIGHTED IN YELLOW.  THE P, NEXT TO EACH USE, IF IT'S A P, IT IS PERMITTED. IF THE CELL IS BLANK, IT IS A NOT PERMITTED OR A PROHIBITED USE. WE ARE ALSO PROPOSING A NEW SECTION, A NEW PARAGRAPH IN SECTION 5163, WHICH ARE THE USE SPECIFIC STANDARDS. TWO WILL BE THE TRANSIT CORRIDOR DEVELOPMENT, USE SPECIFIC STANDARDS. HERE'S JUST A PART OF THE TABLE JUST TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA AND A FLAVOR OF WHAT WE'RE DOING. WE HAVE TWO TYPOLOGIES, BUILD BUILDING TYPES, WHICH ARE MIXED USE BUILDINGS, AND TOWN HOUSE THAT ARE APARTMENTS, AND WE HAVE DIFFERENT SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT STANDARDS WITH UP TO 250 FEET, AND OVER 250 FEET. 250 FEET IS ABOUT THE SIZE OF A DOWNTOWN BLOCK, AND THIS IS, WE, WHEN YOU HAVE LARGE PARCELS WE WOULD LIKE THEM TO BE BROKEN UP INTO ROUGHLY THE SIZE OF A DOWNTOWN BLOCK WHICH IS A COMFORTABLE WALKING DISTANCE AND THERE'S WHERE THE PARAMETERS WERE CHOSEN. HERE ARE SOME GRAPHICS THAT WON'T GO INTO THE UDC, BUT THEY WERE PREPARED FOR TONIGHT'S MEETING TO GIVE, TO HELP WITH A VISUAL FIGURING SOME VISUAL IS BETTER THAN NONE AND THESE ILLUSTRATE THE BUILDINGS, USE SPECIFIC STANDARDS, FOR MIXED USE BUILDINGS ON THE SMALLER SIZE LOT UP TO 250 FEET. THIS ILLUSTRATES THAT IT'S A TWO-STORY BUILDING, THE SECOND STORY IS AT LEAST 75% OF THE FIRST STORY. THE FIRST STORY IS 15 FEET HIGH AND HAS 60 PERCENT TRANSPARENCY WITH ITS WINDOWS. THIS GREEN REPRESENTS THE FRONT BETWEEN 0 AND 10 FEET. HERE IS THE SIDE STEP AREA, AND THE FRONTAGE REQUIREMENT IS THE LOT WIDTH LESS 30 FEET AND ANY SIDES THAT MIGHT BE REQUIRED. AND HERE IS FOR MIXED USE BUILDINGS ON THE LARGE LOT. MULTIPLE BUILDINGS ON THIS SIDE SIZE OF A LOT. BUILDINGS ARE TWO STORIES AGAIN FIRST STORY IS 15 FEET. IT HAS A MAXIMUM DIAGONAL OF 36. THAT'S THE DIAGONAL IF YOU HAVE A BUILDING THAT IS 250 FEET BY 250 FEET. THE FRONTAGE IS THE TWO BUILDINGS COMBINED, 70% OF THE LOT WIDTH. AGAIN, 0 TO 10-FOOT SET BACK HERE, 60 PERCENT TRANSPARENCY. THIS BUILDING HERE IS AT LEAST 750 FEET FROM THE STREET. IT CAN BE ONE STORY, BUT STILL HAS A MAXIMUM DIAGONAL OF 360 FEET. THERE ARE CURBED SIDEWALKS CONNECTING ALL OF THE BUILDINGS, AND YOU CAN SEE THIS SITE CAN BE BROKEN UP INTO FOUR BLOCKS. WE WOULD LIKE BLOCKS TO BE REPLICATED WHEN YOU HAVE A LARGE ENOUGH SITE. WE ALSO ARE ADDING A ROW INTO THE MIXEDED USE ZONING DISTRICT DIMENSIONAL TABLE. T1 HERE. THE DIMENSIONAL TABLE ADDRESSES FOUR AREAS, SETBACKS, HEIGHT, LOT DIMENSIONS. SETBACKS REPEATED ARE MIXED USE BUILDINGS, A MAXIMUM OF 10, TOWN HOUSES MAXIMUM 20, HEIGHT LIMIT IN THE DISTRICT, THE HEIGHT LIMIT IS 120 FEET. THERE IS NO UNLIMITED HEIGHT. THE HEIGHT LIMIT IS 120 FEET. HOWEVER, THERE ARE TWO RANGES OF LOWER HEIGHTS AS YOU GET CLOSER TO RESIDENTIAL ZONING DISTRICT PROXIMITY. HERE'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT WITH THAT. THIS TABLE SHOWS TWO THINGS. IT SHOWS WHAT THE PROPOSED HEIGHT LIMITS ARE FOR THE TC1 DISTRICT, BUT ALSO HAS WHAT THE CURRENT HEIGHT LIMITS ARE. IN RED, THE RED BUILDINGS AND THIS RED LINE IS THE HEIGHT LIMIT OF R1, R2, AND R4C, WHICH IS 30 FEET. NOW, IN THE BLACK, THIS BLACK LINE, AND THIS BLACK OUTLINED BUILDING IS THE HEIGHT LIMIT OF C2B, C3, AND SOME O, AND SOME TC1. WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS IN THE OFFICE DISTRICT WHEN YOU ARE WITHIN 300 FEET OF RESIDENTIAL, THE HEIGHT LIMIT IS 55 FEET. IN THE TC1 DISTRICT, AFTER YOU APPLY YOUR, AND I SHOULD SAY THAT IN THE C2B AND C3 DISTRICT, YOU ONLY APPLY A 30-FOOT SIDE SET BACK AND THEN THE HEIGHT LIMIT IS 55 FEET ACROSS THE DISTRICT AT ALL TIMES.  IN THE TC1 DISTRICT, THE HEIGHT LIMIT IS PROPOSED TO BE 80 FEET BACKWARDS. 55 FEET WHEN YOU ARE WITHIN 80 FEET OF RESIDENTIAL. THEN WHEN YOU ARE BETWEEN 80 AND 300 FEET, THE HEIGHT LIMIT IS 7. THIS IS MORE THAN WHAT YOU WOULDED FIND IN A C2B AND C3 DISTRICT AND MORE THAT'S THAN WHAT THE OFFICE DISTRICT ALLOWS IN THIS RANGE. WHEN YOU GET MORE THAN 300 FEET THE TC1 DISTRICT ALLOWS 120 OF HEIGHT LIMIT.  THE OFFICE DISTRICT IS UNLIMITED, BUT WE ARE PROPOSING 120-FOOT HEIGHT LIMIT IN THE TC1 DISTRICT. WE'RE ALSO ADDING SOME LANGUAGE IN CONFLICTING LAND USE BUFFER LANGUAGE, REFERENCE TC1 WHEN YOU ABUT A RESIDENTIAL ZONING DISTRICT FOR THE PO DISTRICT. SOME NOTES FOR TONIGHT'S DISCUSSION. THE ATTACHED ORDINANCE CONTAINS SOME CHANGES SINCE THE ORDINANCE REVISIONS COMMITTEE DISCUSSED IT ON MARCH 23RD. BASICALLY THE HEIGHT LIMIT HAS CHANGED FROM 40 FEET TO 55 FEET WHEN YOU'RE WITHIN 80 FEET OF RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT. THAT IS SO THAT IT IS THE SAME AS WHAT IS CURRENTLY ALLOWED IN THE UNDERLYING DISTRICT. THERE WAS TALK ABOUT PARKING STRUCTURES BEING ADJACENT TO THE STREET AND IN A BUILDING.  AND THERE IS NO LANGUAGE CURRENTLY IN THE ORDINANCE. HOWEVER, THE PLANNING COMMISSION MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER AN MENDMENT TO REFERENCE TC1 IN SPECIC STANDARDS FOR PARKING D SUPERIMPLY, THOUGH REQUIREMENTS SAY THAT THE FIRST 25 FEET OF A BUILDING HAS TO BE ANOTHER PERMITTED USE IF THE BUILDING IS RIGHT NEXT TO THE STREET AND THERE'S PARKING ON THE FIRST FLOOR. SO YOU CAN HAVE SOME OF THE BUILDINGS, OR A LOT OF THE BUILDING BE PARKING BUT THE FIRST 25 FEET WHAT IS FRONTING THE STREET SIDE HAS TO BE SOME OTHER PERMITTED USE THAN PARKING. ALSO FOR DISCUSSION THE SMALL LOT FRONTAGE WHICH IS THE WIDTH OF THE LOT MINUS 30 FEET AND ANY SIDES STEP SET BACKS.  THIS COULD BE 60 FEET IN SOME CASES WHERE THE PARCEL ABUTS A RESIDENTIAL ZONING DISTRICT. THUS MAY BE A LITTLE EXCESSIVE. MAYBE THE DEDUCTION SHOULD JUST BE A FLAT 30 FEET, OR MAYBE THE DEDUCTION MIGHT BE 45 FEET, WHICH IS A 30-FOOT DEDUCTION ALLOWING FOR A DRIVEWAY AND SIDE WALKS ADJACENT TO THE DRIVEWAY. FOR REFERENCE, 60 PERCENT TRANSPARENCY IS REQUIRED DOWNTOWN AND SOME OF THE MOST DESIRABLE VISUALLY APPEALING TOWNHOUSES IN TOWN PROBABLY ALL AT LEAST HAVE 40 PERCENT TRANSPARENCY. I EXHAUSTED MY ABILITIES FOR TERRIBLE GRAPHICS SO I WILL JUST SHOW YOU SOME BUILDINGS. THIS IS WHAT WE'RE AIMING FOR. THIS IS A BUILDING THAT'S BARELY TWO OR THREE YEARS OLD. IT IS THE REINHARDT BUILDING AT 2275 WEST STADIUM.  IT IS A TWO-STORY BUILDING THAT IS A 10-FOOT BACK TO THE ROAD, IT'S GOT A 15-FOOT FIRST FLOOR, AT LEAST 60 PERCENT TRANSPARENCY THERE. IT'S 40 FEET TALL. HERE ARE TWO RECENTISH BUILDINGS AS WELL, FOUR TO FIVE YEARS OLD I BELIEVE.  THESE BUILDINGS ARE BOTH 75 FEET TALL, GIVE OR TAKE COUPLE OF FEET, BUT THESE BUILDINGS ARE BOTH 75 FEET TALL. THEY HAVE FIRST FLOORS THAT PROBABLY APPROACH 60 PERCENT TRANSPARENCY, AND THEY ARE RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS. THEY HAVE A SHALLOWER SET BACK WHICH WOULD BE ALLOWED IN THE TC1 DISTRICT, BUT THESE SET BACKS ARE SLIGHTLY LESS THAN 10 FEET. HERE ARE SOME RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS AND THIS HERE IN THE UPPER LEFT IS THE HUB. IT'S IN THE D1 DISTRICT. IT IS REQUIRED TO HAVE 60 PERCENT TRANSPARENCY ON IT FOR IT'LL GOT TWO-STORY AND THEN A HIGH RISE. IT'S GOT 60 PERCENT TRANSPARENCY. THIS HAS A ZERO SET BACK AS WELL. HERE IS A RENDERING OF A APPROVED PROJECT THAT'S NOT YET BUILD BUILT.  THESE ARE THREE-STORY TOWN HOMES WITH DOORS, FRONT STEPS, LEADING TO THEM COVERED WITH A LITTLE BIT OF AN AWNING THERE. THESE ARE ABOUT 60 PERCENT OR MORE TRANSPARENCY. HERE IN THE LOWER LEFT IS THE BLUE DEVELOPMENT. THESE ARE 3060 PERCENT TRANSPARENCY, BUT I THINK THEY ARE AN EXAMPLE -F OF WHAT WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE ALONG ANY OF THE CORRIDORS IF YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT A TOWN HOUSE. THESE ARE MORE LIKE 40 PERCENT TRANSPARENCY. RIGHT NOW WE ARE NOT PROPOSING ANY AMOUNT OF TRANSPARENCY REQUIREMENT FOR AGE APARTMENT OR TOWN HOUSE BUILDING TYPE. I'M CLOSE TO WRAPPING IT UP, BUT I'LL SHOW YOU HERE THE 777 EISENHOWER BUILDING. IT'S A TALL BUILDING BUT IT'S GOT A DEEP FRONT SET BACK, AND BEHIND IT HAS GOT A PRETTY BIG SURFACE PARKING LOT AS WELL. AND HERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF A PLAY JUST WITH AN iPAD PUTTING THE YARD BUILDING IN FRONT OF THE 777 EISENHOWER BUILDING. NOW, I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE THAT THIS BUILDING WOULD ACTUALLY FIT IN THE FRONT YARD OF 777, BUT I THINK IT GIVES YOU A FLAVOR OF WHAT WE'RE KIND OF TALKING ABOUT. YOU KNOW, WE CAN ADD ANOTHER LAYER OF DEVELOPMENT IN PARTICIPANT OF OR NEXT TO - - — IN FRONT OF OR NEXT TO AN EXISTING BUILDING. IT WOULD FIT WELL AND BLEND IN WITH WHAT WE'VE GOT EXISTING. SO AGAIN, I JUST, UM, BLITZED THROUGH THE PROPOSED ORDINANCE AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS ABOUT MAYBE THE MASTER PLAN OR SOMETHING ELSE IN THE STAFF REPORT. I WILL JUST CONCLUDE BY SAYING THAT WITH THIS PACKAGE OF AMENDMENTS THAT WERE ATTACHED TO THE STAFF REPORT WE RECOMMENDING APPROVAL OF THEM AND IF THE PLANNING COMMISSION ALSO RECOMMENDS APPROVAL OF THEM TONIGHT THEY WILL MOVE FORWARD TO THE CITY COUNCIL AT ITS NEXT AVAILABLE MEETING. AND WE ARE HAVE BEEN ASKED BY CITY COUNCIL TO DELIVER TO THEM PROPOSED ORDINANCE BY JUNE.
00:53:28.746: >> VERY GOOD. I SEE YOUR HAND.
00:53:33.017: >> THANK YOU. I WANT TO ADDRESS TWO THINGS. FIRST OF ALL, I WANT TO THANK ALEXIS FOR, SHE PUT LOT OF EFFORT TO PROVIDE SOME VISUAL EXAMPLES AND REPRESENTATIONS TO HELP ILLUSTRATE THIS AND I THINK SHE DID PHENOMENAL WORK. ON THAT ISSUE, I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR, I HAVE HEARD THE COMMISSION LOUD AND CLEAR THAT YOU EXPECT TO HAVE THOSE TYPES OF VISUALS INCORPORATED TO THE ORDINANCE.  FROM A PRACTICAL MATTER I DON'T HAVE THAT ABILITY IN-HOUSE TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. THAT'S SOMETHING I'M GOING TO HAVE TO CONTRACT OUT. MY INTENTION IS TO DO SO, BUT I DON'T WANT TO GO THROUGH MULTIPLE ITERATIONS OF THOSE GRAPHICS. MY GOAL IS TO IDENTIFY SORT OF WHAT THE ZONING DISTRICT PARAMETERS ARE GOING TO BE. AND I THINK WE CAN PROVIDE OTHER EXAMPLES AND REFERENCES TO OUR BEST ABILITY, BUT MY I JUST WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I'VE HEARD THE PLANNING COMMISSION LOUD AND CLEAR. WE AGREE THAT AS THIS IS ADAPTED IT NEEDS TO BE QUICKLY UPDATED AND MODIFIED TO PROVIDE THOSE VISUALS TO REFLECT THE TEXT. MY INTENTION AT THIS POINT IS TO REALLY DO THAT AS SORT OF A SECOND PHASE OF THIS AFTER WE ARE AT A POINT WHERE WE KNOW THAT THE ORDINANCE IS ADOPTED AND IT IS IN ITEM NUMBER CURRENT PARAMETERS AND CONFIGURATIONS. THAT'S ALL.
00:55:04.008: >> ALL RIGHT. VERY GOOD. LET'S OPEN THE PUBLIC HEARING AND THEN I'LL READ THE MOTION AFTER THAT'S ALL DONE. SO THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PERSONS TO SPEAK FOR UP TO THREE MINUTES ABOUT THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS ESTABLISHING A NEW TRANSIT CORRIDOR ZONING DISTRICT. PUBLIC COMMENT CALL 877-853-5412, AND THEN ENTER MEETING ID929-1620-2435. CITY STAFF WILL CALL ON THOSE WHO HAVE RAISED THEIR HAND DIGITALLY BY PRESSING STAR 9 ON THEIR PHONE. YOU'LL HEAR AN AUTOMATED ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE HOST IS ALLOWING YOU TO SPEAK, AND MR. LEONARD WILL CALL OUT THE LAST THREE DIGITS OF YOUR TELEPHONE NUMBER. PLEASE MOVE A QUIET AREA AND MUTE ANY BACKGROUND SOUNDS LIKE YOUR DOG OR WHOEVER WAS JUST BARKING, AND PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS AT THE BEGINNING OF YOUR COMMENTS. PLEASE DO KEEP THEM TO THREE MINUTES.
00:56:12.710: >> THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 618, CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 618, YOU CAN UNMUTE YOUR PHONE USING STAR 6, AND ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
00:56:26.323: >> HI, THERE. THIS IS MICHELLE HUGHES, 214 CHARLES STREET.  I'M EXCITED TO SEE SOME CHANGE HERE. I DEFINITELY RIDE MY BIKE AROUND SOME OF THESE AREAS THAT YOU'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT AND IT'S NO FUN TO SEE A SEA OF PARKING AND TO BE IN A HUMAN IN A PLACE THAT'S BUILT FOR CARS.  I THINK THAT IT'S HIGH TIME THAT WE START BUILDING FOR HUMANS RATHER THAN CARS. THOSE TWO THINGS I THING IT'S TIME TO ADMIT OUR, YOU CAN'T DO BOTH OF THOSE THINGS AT THE PSALM TIME. IF I HAD TO CHOOSE I'M ON TEAM HUMAN. SO I'M EXCITED ABOUT THIS. AND I HOPE THAT IT WILL BRING MORE HABITABLE SPACE AND MORE PLACES THAT ARE FUN IN THE CITY, MORE DESTINATIONS FOR HUMANS. I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED IT MIGHT BE TOO CONSERVATIVE FOR OUR CURRENT HOUSING CRISIS.  I THINK, I DON'T KNOW WHY WE'RE ARBITRARILY LIMITING HEIGHT, ESPECIALLY SINCE SOME OF THOSE ZONES IT'S REPLACING DON'T HAVE LIMITED HEIGHTS. AND I DON'T HAVE A GOOD PICTURE OF MY HEAD OF WHAT 120 FEET IS, BUT I CAN'T IMAGINE A SIZE OF BUILDING THAT WOULD BE MORO FENCIVE TO ME THAN THE HOUSING CRISIS AND THE PRICE OF HOUSING IN THIS TOWN. SO I SAY, YOU KNOW, MAKE THIS, MAKE THE CITY A PLACE FOR MORE PEOPLE TO LIVE SO WE CAN SHARE OUR WONDERFUL COMMUNITY. AND MAKE MORE PLACES THAT ARE WONDERFUL THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SHARE. AND THIS IS I THINK THIS IS GOOD STEPS TOWARDS THAT DIRECTION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
00:58:18.435: >> THANK YOU. [NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE]
00:58:30.147: >> CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 786. CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER 786.  YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
00:58:38.455: >> HI, THIS IS WILL LEASE AT 715 LAWRENCE, GREAT JOB IMPROVING THE DISTRICT.  I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SOME SUGGESTIONS ABOUT THE RANGE OF THE DISTRICT.  I SERVED ON THERE T1 COMMITTEE BACK IN 2017 WHEN THE PROJECT STARTED AND THERE'S BEEN DEBATE SINCE THE BEGINNING ABOUT THE RANGE. I ARGUED THEN AS I WOULD ARGUE NOW THAT THE DISTRICT SHOULD ALSO BE APPLIED TO LIGHT INDUSTRIAL CORRIDORS AND AT THAT TIME IN 2017 A STAFF MEMBERINGA OFFERED THAT ALLOWING THE DISTRICT TO BE APPLIED IN THOSE AREAS WOULD QUICKLY YIELD NEW HOUSING BUT IT WOULD DISPLACE LIGHT INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES TO THE TOWNSHIPS AND THAT THIS WOULD BE A BAD RESULT. I DISAGREE.  I THINK HOUSING SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO COMPETE ON EQUAL FOOTING WITH LIGHT INDUSTRIAL USES, AND I THINK CITY COUNCIL'S RESOLUTION SUPPORTS THE SAME. SO I RECOMMEND MAKING THIS DISTRICT SLIGHTLY MORE FLEXIBLE. SPECIFICALLY IN THE GENERAL INTENT STATEMENT I RECOMMEND REMOVING THE SPECIFIC REFERENCE TO ESTABLISHED COMMERCIAL AND OFFICE DISTRICTS, AND JUST END THAT SENTENCE RIGHT BEFORE THAT POINT. YOU WOULDN'T THEN BE LIMITING THE PLACES, THE PLANNING COMMISSION COULD USE THE DISTRICT IN THE FUTURE. AND THEN FOR THE SPECIFIC PURPOSE STATEMENTS, I RECOMMEND ELIMINATING THEM. MOST OF OUR ZONING DISTRICTS DON'T HAVE SPECIFIC PURPOSE STATEMENTS AND THE GENERAL INTENT THEY PROVIDE GUIDANCE ALREADY. IF YOU DID WANT TO KEEP THE SPECIFIC PURPOSE STATEMENTS, I SUGGEST REMOVING THE TEXT IN THE THIRD STATEMENT ABOUT ESTABLISHED COMMERCIAL AND OFFICE SITES. IN THE SECOND STATEMENT REMOVING THE RULE ABOUT COMMISSIONER DISCHLY LOUING REZONING REQUESTS - ABOUT ONLY ALLOWING RONING IF A DEVOPERAMEND SD I DUSTRIALEXT TO BUSTOP, IH THK WE'D BE CRAZY TO NOT TAKE THAT PROPOSAL SERIOUSLY. I THINK AT THE VERY LEAST THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED BY THE PLANNING COMMISSION AND FUTURE PLANNING COMMISSIONS SHOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO CONSIDER THOSE PROPOSALS. I RECOMMEND ALLOWING THOSE REQUEST SAID. THE CITY'S BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING AT 2000 SOUTH INDUSTRIAL RIGHT NOW. TO NOT EVEN CONSIDER MARKET RATE REQUESTS ALONG THAT SAME CORRIDOR I THINK WOULD NOT BE WISE. THE FINAL SUGGESTION WOULD BE FLEXIBLE ON HEIGHT.
01:01:09.806: >> 30 MORE SECONDS.
01:01:10.874: >> THE THREE STORY, UM, MINIMUM HEIGHT LIMIT ON TOWN HOUSES ON THE BIGGER LOTS COULD BE REMOVED TO ALLOW THOSE TWO STORY TOWN HOUSES YOU SAW IN SOME EARLIER SLIDES. SO YEAH, TWEAKING THOSE SPECIFIC PURPOSE STATEMENTS IN THE GENERAL STATEMENT TO NOT JUST ALLOW APPLY TO COMMERCIAL AND OFFICE SITES I THINK WILL ALLOW THIS DISTRICT TO BE APPLIED IN THE FUTURE TO OTHER AREAS.  IT WILL BASICALLY KEEP YOUR OPTIONS OPEN AND NOT LIMIT FUTURE PLANNING COMMISSIONS FROM USING THIS TOOL. AFTER YOU MAKE THOSE CHANGES - -
01:01:41.772: >> THANK YOU.
01:01:42.506: >> I THINK THIS WOULD BE A GREAT RUE ELLIE GREAT TOOL AND THANKS FOR ALL OF YOUR WORK.
01:01:47.377: >> GREAT, THANK YOU.
01:01:53.684: >> CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 499.  YOU CAN UNMUTE YOUR FOLK AND ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION. CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 499, YOU CAN UNMUTE YOUR PHONE AND ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION. [.
01:02:30.420: >> MICHAEL HOMEL, - - 3473WOODEL COURT AND A FORMER MEMBER OF THE, UH, WOOD CREEK - - HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION. I WANT TO ADVOCATE FOR THE REMOVAL OF WASHINAW AVENUE FROM THE THE TC1 DISTRICT.
01:02:53.610: >> SIR, IT MIGHT BE EASIER IF YOU, UM, MUTE THE TV FOR JUST A MINUTE. THERE'S A DELAY AND IT CAUSES SOME WEIRD THINGS HAPPENING.
01:03:03.687: >> OKAY, COULD YOU MUTE IT IN. ANYWAY, I WANT TO MAKE SEVERAL POINTS.  FIRST OF ALL... COULD YOU MUTE IT? THE YOU GO.
01:03:17.234: >> THERE YOU GO, MY WIFE IS TRYING TO DO THAT RIGHT NOW. SORRY.  ARE WE GOOD TO GO NOW?
01:03:23.273: >> YES, I THINK WE'RE MUCH BETTER.
01:03:25.108: >> OKAY, THANK YOU.
01:03:28.178: >> I HOPE THE COMMISSION WILL REMOVE AVENUE FROM THE ORDINANCE CURRENTLY TRAFFIC IS UNREASONABLY CONGESTED.  IT WAS RATED AS A FAILING GRADE FROM THOSE WHO STUDY THAT TO APPROVE THE ORDINANCE OR JUST INCREASE CONGESTION IN THAT AREA. SECONDLY THE HEIGHT LIMITS OF 8Y AS 300 FEET ARE JUST VERY APPROPRIATE FOR DOWNTOWN BUT ARE NOT CONGRUENT WITH THE AREA WHICH IS RESIDENTIAL BEHIND WASHINAW AND MIXED USE. THIRD, MANY OF THE ADVOCATES OF THIS ORDINANCE HAVE SAID THIS IS A WAY TO INCREASE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND WHILE THE VOTERS IMPROVE THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING VILLAGE ON THE - - A LOOK AT THE NEW DEVELOPMENT BOTH DOWNTOWN AND NEAR DOWNTOWN AND LOOK AT THE RENT AND THE PRICES AND RENTALS SHOW THAT REALLY AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHILE A FINE GOAL IS A MYTH, IS APPLIED TO THESE AREAS THEY WOULD NOT BE AFFORDABLE. SO THANKS VERY, VERY MUCH FOR YOUR SERVICE ON THE COMMISSION AND THANKS FOR LISTENING TO THESE COMMENTS.  THANKS MUCH.
01:04:50.694: >> THANK YOU.
01:04:58.401: >> CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 955. CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 955, YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES.
01:05:08.111: >> HI, GOOD EVENING, COMMISSION KIRK WESTFALL, THANKS SO MUCH AGAIN FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS TOPIC.  SUPER EXCITED THAT IT'S COMING TO FRUITION, ALSO BY EQUAL MEASURE A BIT FEARFUL OF THE OPPORTUNITY COSTS OF LEAVING A LOT OF ONLAND ON THE TABLE AS CURRENTLY ENVISIONED. I JUST WANT TO QUICKLY RECAP WHAT I COVERED IN MY E-MAIL TODAY WHICH I STILL HOPE YOU'LL READ ANYWAY. JUST TO FIRST ENCOURAGE YOU TO ASK THAT THAT STAFF AT A MINIMUM EXPAND THE LENGTH OF THE PROPOSED CORRIDORS MARLEY STATE AND PLYMOUTH. THEY INCLUDE PARTIALS THAT ARE RIGHT NEXT TO THE U OF M CAMPUSES AND THE HOSPITAL. SECOND AS THE PREVIOUS CALLER HAD ALLUDE TO PLEASE CREATE A PRACTICAL ELIGIBLEILITY RADIUS. THIRD, LOVE YOU TO CONSIDER INCLUDING OTHER CORRIDORS LIKE INDUSTRIAL PACKARD, SOUTH MAIN, ANN ARBOR SELINE, SITTING THROUGH DIFFERENT PLANNING EXERCISES THE COMMITTEE THINKS OF ALL THESE ARTERIAL ROADS IN THE SAME BASKET AND REALLY WANTS REFORM ON ALL OF THEM. SO IF THIS CURRENT EFFORT ISN'T COVERING THEM ALL, I WOULD JUST ASK YOU TO THINK ABOUT A TIME TABLE FOR GETTING TO THE MALL. AND JUST ALLOWING MORE ZONING DISTRICTS TO BE REPLACED NOW ESPECIALLY INCLUDING THE R5 MO HOTEL DISTRICT, AND - - R5 HOTEL DISTRICT, AND OPEN TO R4, A, B, AND D, WHICH CAN ALSO BE FOUND ALONG CORRIDORS AND ARE CURRENTLY KIND OF CREATING HOLES IN THE MAPS YOU HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU NOW. TECHNICALLY THESE ARE RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS BUT THEY'RE PROFESSIONALLY MANAGED, AND THEY ARE LOWER DENSITY HEIGHT PARKING RATIO TYPE PLACES THAT I THINK SHOULD ALSO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE REDEVELOPED A BIT MORE DENSELY AND CAR LIGHT. AND LAST I I'D LIKE TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO STILL TO WRITE IN THE PROVISION THAT WOULD MANDATE MIXED USE BUILDINGS WITH ACTIVE GROUND FOUR USES ON CORNERS, SAY, WITHIN A HUNDRED FEET OF A CORNER. I THINK PLAYING THE LONG GAME AND THINKING OF HOW THESE AREAS MIGHT BECOME KIND OF URBAN VILLAGES OVER TIME - -
01:07:50.140: >> 30 MORE SECONDS.
01:07:51.441: >> WE'D GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE, YOU KNOW, REAL NICE WALKABLE AMENITIES ON THE GROUND FLOOR INSTEAD OF COMERICA BANK OR SOMETHING. THIS IS A GREAT DISTRICT, IT'S PRETTY MUCH SUPERIOR IN EVERY CONCEIVABLE WAY TO VIRTUALLY EVERY MULTIFAMILY ZONING DISTRICT THAT WE'VE GOT. I DON'T THINK THERE'S A REASON TO POSTPONE OR DELAY THIS PROCESS, BUT I DO HOPE YOU WOULD MOVE THIS FORWARD TO COUNCIL WITH MAP EXPANSIONS AND ORDINANCE LANGUAGE FLEXIBILITY. THANK YOU.
01:08:31.581: >> CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 617. CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 617. YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES.
01:08:43.426: >> THIS IS JONATHAN LEVINE, I THANK THE COMMISSION AND STAFF VERY MUCH FOR THE WORK ON THE ZONE AND THE IMPROVEMENTS TO THE ZONE. I STRONGLY HERBAL IMPROVEMENTS OF THE ZONE. NOTHING I'M ABOUT TO SAY IS DESIGNED TO DELAY APPROVAL. I DO THINK THERE'S SOME IMPROVEMENTS THAT COULD BE MADE. I'LL START WITH THE SMALLER ISSUE AND GO TO A COUPLE OF LARGER ISSUES. THE MANDATE FOR THREE STORIES IN RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS ON LARGER PARCELS. I ASSUME THE INTENT HERE IS TO INCREASE HOUSING SUPPLY PRODUCTION FOR EXAMPLE IN THE THIRD FLOOR OF AN APARTMENT BUILDING. I WORRY THAT AN OUTCOME THAT'S AT LEAST AS LIKELY IS SPURRING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THREE STORY TOWN HOUSE WHICH WOULD BE LARGE AND UNDOUBTEDLY VERY PRICEY. I DON'T THINK WE HAVE A CITY INTEREST IN MANDATING LARGE HOUSING UNITS, QUITE THE OPPOSITE IF WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT AFFORDABILITY. I RECOMMEND PERMITTING BUT NOT REQUIRING FLOORS BEYOND THE SECOND, EVEN ON THE LARGER PARCELS. THE SECOND LARGER ISSUE IS HOW THE CITY OUGHT TO BE RECEIVING OF THIS TASK. NOTHING ABOUT THE WORK DONE TODAY WOULD PRECLUDE CITY INITIATED REZONINGS. I'D REALLY SUGGEST TURNING THIS AROUND. THE PLANNING COMMISSION'S EXPECTATION SHOULD BE THAT THE TC1 ZONE, WHICH IS INITIALLY ENACTED AS A FLOATING ZONE, WILL ULTIMATELY BE THE ZONE TO GUIDE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE CORRIDORS INTO THE FUTURE AND TO BEGIN THAT CITY INITIATED REZONING IMMEDIATELY UPON ESTABLISHMENT OF THE TC1 ZONE. DELAY WOULD ONLY PRODUCE A COUNTER PRODUCTIVE PATCHWORK OF CONFLICTING ZONES ON ADJACENT PARCELS.  THE THIRD, AND I WANT TO ECHO WHAT A FEW OTHER CALLERS HAVE SAID THAT PERTAIN TO THE EXTENT OF THE ZONES BOTH IN TERMS OF LENGTH, IN TERMS OVERWIDED, AND IN TERMS OF ADDITIONAL CORRIDORS.  I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THE ADDITIONAL CORRIDORS IS SOUTH INDUSTRIAL WITH ITS PROXIMITY TO CENTRAL ANN ARBOR AND THE FREQUENT BUS SERVICE.  THE STAFF EXPRESSES CONCERN ABOUT HARMING RATHER THAN HELPING THE TRANSIT SYSTEM BY EXTENDING THE AREA OF TRANSIT SUPPORT OF ZONING BEYOND THE CONSTRAINED CORRIDORS THAT IT SPECIFIED.  I DISAGREE WITH THIS REASONSING. ZONING FOR LOWER DENSITIES AND MANDATED PARKING ENDS UNEXPANDING THE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM, BUT ON THE AUTOMOBILE SIDE.
01:11:13.977: >> 30 MORE SECONDS.
01:11:16.045: >> THE PROBLEM OF NEW BUS RIDERS INSTEAD OF NEW DRIVERS WOULD BE A TERRIFIC PROBLEM TO HAVE, EVEN IF THOSE NEW BUS RIDERS COME FROM BEYOND THE VERY TIGHTLY CIRCUMSCRIBED CORRIDORS.  THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
01:11:28.658: >> THANK YOU.
01:11:37.534: >> CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 949. CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 949. YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
01:11:46.943: >> HI, MY NAME IS ADAM, I'M AT 1430 LAS VEGAS DRIVE RIGHT NEAR ONE OF THESE AREAS. THE WEST STADIUM CORRIDOR.  I ALREADY SENT AN E-MAIL SUPPORTING THIS, I DO SUPPORT IT, AND I'D JUST LIKE TO ECHO SOME OF THE OTHER CALLERS IN THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS JUST BE MORE AMBITIOUS, MORE CORRIDORS, LARGER CORRIDORS, LONGER, I LIKE THE IDEA OF SOUTH INDUSTRIAL BEING PART OF THIS. MAKE THEM ABLE TO BE EXPANDED IN THE FUTURE AND JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE. I RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS POSSIBLY A CONTENTIOUS ISSUE BUT I THINK WE COULD GO A LITTLE BIT FURTHER. THANK YOU.

01:13:08.791: >> HELLO, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
01:13:12.395: >> WE CAN.
01:13:14.030: >> GREAT.  MY NAME IS BLARE CURTIS I LIVE AT 3480 WOODDALE COURT ON PROPERTY THAT WOULD BE WASHIN ARK,NDSN EARERR ALONG CALLERLLUDED'M VERY CONCERNED OUT THE INCASED DENSITY OF TRAFFIC ALONG WASHTENAW. AS SOMEONE WHO TRAVELS IT DAILY AND HAS FOR ALMOST TWO DECADES, INCROCED CREASE DISTRICT ATTORNEY - - INCREASED DENSITY IS A SIGNIFICANT CONCERN AND REQUEST REMOVE REMOVAL OF WASHTENAW REMOVED AND SOME OF THE SPECIFIC FEATURES YOU'VE IDENTIFIED SUCH AS HAVING PARKING STRUCTURES THEY MIGHT NOT FRONT THE CORRIDOR BUT HAVING A PARKING STRUCTURE THAT WOULD BE ADJACENT TO RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT CONCERN PARTICULARLY WITH SAFETY, FOR EXAMPLE. AND ALSO THE UNLIMITED POTENTIAL FOR HEIGHT IS A CONCERN WITH THE ISSUES WITH BLOCKING SUNLIGHT AND THE NOISE AND THE OTHER ADVERSE IMPACTS IT WOULD HAVE ON DAILY LIFE FOR PEOPLE WHO LIVE ADJACENT TO THE WASHTENAW CORRIDOR AND HAVE TO TRAVEL IT DAILY.  I APPRECIATE THE TIME AND EFFORT THAT'S PUT INTO THIS AND WOULD HOPE THAT YOU WOULD TAKE THE CONCERNS OF RESIDENTS WHO USE THE CORRIDOR ON A REGULAR BASIS AND LIVE NEARBY AND WOULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY THIS NEW ZONING POTENTIAL THAT YOU WOULD TAKE THEM SERIOUSLY. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
01:15:08.678: >> CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 340.  CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 340. YOU CAN UNMUTE YOUR PHONE USING STAR 6 AND ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
01:15:18.988: >> GREETINGS, PLANNING COMMISSION. LUIS VASQUEZ FROM 1442 PONTIAC TRAWL ON THE FIRST WARD HERE IN ANN ARBOR. I'M GOING TO BE VERY BRIEF. I DON'T NEED TO ADD TO A LOT OF WHAT'S BEEN SPOKEN ABOUT PARTICULARLY BY MR. LEAF, MR. WESTFALL, AND MR. LAVINE. I'M IN TOTAL AGREEMENT WITH THEIR COMMENTS AND JUST SPEAKING IN SUPPORT FOR MAKING THESE CHANGES.  HOWEVER, MY ONLY CRITICISM IS THAT THEY DON'T GO FAR ENOUGH. I THINK THAT YOU NEED TO CONSIDER WIDER CORRIDORS, LONGER CORRIDORS. I MEAN, REALLY, GO BIG. GO LARGE. AND ADOPT MORE AGGRESSIVE TIME TIME TIMELINE WITH THESE PROPOSALS TO BUILD. WE ARE STILL IN A VERY PROFOUND HOUSING CRISIS IN ANN ARBOR AND WE NEED MORE HOUSING TO BE BUILT AND WITH THE ADDITIONS OF MIXED USE BUILDINGS ALONG THESE CORRIDORS I THINK THAT WOULD GO ALONG WAY TOWARDS FILLING THE GAPS. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. YOU'RE DOING GREAT WORK. AND CARRY ON.
01:16:50.279: >> THANK YOU.
01:16:58.354: >> CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 534. CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 534. UNMUTE YOUR PHONE AND YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
01:17:10.366: >> GOOD EVENING THIS IS TOM CALLING FROM LOWER TOWN. IN ANN ARBOR. I WANT TO THANK STAFF FOR THE CONSIDERABLE RABBLE AMOUNT OF HOMEWORK DONE TO DEEM STRAINT THE CONSISTENCY WITH THE PASTOR PLAN. DEMONSTRATE THE CONSISTENCY OF THE MASTER PLAN. I'LL CUT TO THE CHASE. THERE'S STILL A STEP THAT WAS MISSING. A ZONING ORDINANCE IS A CODIFICATION IN THE LAW OF A PLAN. THE MASTER PLAN, AS IT STANDS, DOES NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT DETAIL TO BE SATISFIED IN THE LAW. HOW DID WE GET FROM THE MASTER PLAN AS IT STANDS, AS YOU'VE DOCUMENTED IN YOUR HOMEWORK, TO THE ACTUAL CODIFICATION IN THE LAW OF THE SPECIFICS. WELL, THROUGH THE PLANNING COMMISSION.  MEANING THAT YOU'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN, THAT SOME OF US HAVE PARTICIPATED IN, AND THIS PUBLIC HEARING RIGHT NOW. THOSE ALL DEMONSTRATE EXACTLY WHAT A MASTER PLAN PROCESS WOULD INVOLVE. IT WOULD INVOLVE THE BROADER COMMUNITY AND AN EXPLORATION OF SOME OF THE PROS AND CONS OF THE ISSUES, AND THEN WE WOULD BE HERE AFTER REVISING THAT MASHER PLAN, PERHAPS WITH SPECIFIC DEFINITIONS OF THE BORDERS IN THE AREAS, AND WE WOULD HAVE THOSE AREAS MASTER PLANNED FOR TC1. AND THEN THERE'S NO CONFUSION WHEN A DEVELOPER COMES FOR A REZONING WHO'S IN ONE OF THOSE AREAS, AND IS ABLE TO SAY I WOULD LIKE TO BE REZONED TO TC1 AND LOOK, THE MASTER PLAN FOR THIS PARCEL SAYS THAT'S THE MASTER PLAN FOR TC1. WE REALLY DID SKIP A STEP AND IT'S UNFORTUNATE.  WHEN YOU SKIP A STEP OFTEN THERE'S SOME ERRORS THAT ARE MADE, SOME THINGS THAT AREN'T TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION, AND THE BIGGEST PART IS THE INPUT THAT GOES INTO THE MASTER PLAN. SOMETHING LIKE THIS THAT IS PRETTY BROAD ACROSS THE CITY, THAT REALLY BLOCKS TO A LARGER ELEMENT OF THE COMMUNITY. A VERY SMALL NUMBER OF US WHO ARE PAYING ATTENTION TO THIS HAVE GOTTEN TO PARTICIPATE AS IF IT WAS A MASTER PLAN PROCESS, BUT IT'S BEEN A VERY LIMITED NUMBER OF PEOPLE. IT'S CONSISTENT WITH GOOD PLANNING AND ZONING EXCEPT FOR SKIPPING A STEP AND COMBINING THE FINAL TWO STEPS INTO ONE AND THAT SHUT OUT A GOOD DEAL OF OUR COMMUNITY FROM BEING ABLE TO PARTICIPATE AND WE HAVE A LOT TO LEARN FROM EACH OTHER.
01:19:46.055: >> 30 MORE SECONDS.
01:19:46.856: >> THERE WILL BE A LOT OF GOOD IDEAS OUT THERE. THE IDEA IS THAT THE COMMUNITY, WE WANT OUR MASTER PLAN TO BE THE COMMUNITY'S VISION, AND WE WANT OUR ZONING ORDINANCE TO SIMPLY CODIFY THAT INTO RULES, AND WE'VE TAKEN THE VISIONING, AND THE RULEMAKING, AND COMBINED THEM INTO ONE AND THAT REALLY ISN'T THE PROPER PROCESS. SO LET'S HOPE IT WORKS OUT AND I WISH WE HAD FOLLOWED THE PROPER PROCESS, THANK YOU.
01:20:14.683: >> THANK YOU. IF ANYONE ELSE ON THE LINE WHO WISHES TO ADDRESS PLANNING COMMISSION DURING THE PUBLIC HEARING.  IF SO, PLEASE PRESS STAR 9 ON YOUR PHONE.
01:20:23.993: >> ALL THE CALLERS ON THE LINE HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN.
01:20:26.862: >> VERY GOOD. THEN I WILL CALL THE PUBLIC, I WILL CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING AND READ THE MOTION.  FLUSH. THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION HERE STANDBY RECOMMENDS THE MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL APPROVE AMENDMENTS TO THE UNIFIED DEDEVELOP DEVELOPMENT CODE TO CREATE TC1, TRANSIT CORRIDOR. BECAUSE CREATING A DISTRICT IN THE PROPOSED PERMITTED USES USE-SPECIFIC STANDARDS AND DIMENSIONAL STANDARDS ARE RECOMMENDED BY NUMEROUS GOALS AND ACTIONS IN THE CITY PASTOR PLAN FOR INCREASING DENSITY ALONG TRANSIT CORRIDORS.  MOVED BY COMMISSIONER SAUVE, SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER ABRONS. DOES ANYBODY NEED A 5-MINUTE BREAK BEFORE WE START DISCUSSION OR SHOULD WE... DOES ANYBODY NEED A 5-MINUTE BREAK? WE WILL TAKE THAT AFTER THIS. I NEED A STRETCH BREAK THEN. WHO WANTS TO KICKOFF DISCUSSION? COMMISSIONER ABRONS.
01:21:30.359: >> THANK YOU. I THOUGHT MAYBE IT WOULD BE GOOD TO KICKOFF OUR CONVERSATION BY GETTING CLARIFICATION ON LIKE ELIGIBILITY AND TARGET ZONING, AND JUST MAKE SURE THAT I UNDERSTAND AND ALSO FOR THE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING. SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT STAFF HAS IDENTIFIED CORRIDORS THAT THEY CONSIDER TO BE GOOD CANDIDATES BUT THAT'S, THERE'S NOT A LEGAL LIMITATION TO ONLY THOSE PARCELS BEING ELIGIBLE FOR TC1 ZONING. COULD YOU CORRECT OR CONFIRM MY UNDERSTANDING?
01:22:08.731: >> I CAN CONFIRM YOUR UNDERSTANDING. WHEN PUSH COMES TO SHOVE, THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT THAT THE ZONING MAP BE ABSOLUTELY SPOT ON WITH THE PLAN. WHEN PUSH COMES TO SHOVE, THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT THAT YOUR MASTER PLAN 110% MATCH YOUR ZONING ORDINANCE AND ZONING MAP. THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO WORK IN HARMONY, BUT IT IS KNOWN AND UNDERSTOOD THAT YOU, THAT A LEGISLATIVE BODY CAN FIND UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES AND EX 10 W-TING CIRCUMSTANCES EXTERN W-TING CIRCUMSTANCES AND THEY ARE FREE TO MAKE THEIR LEGISLATIVE DECISION. IF THE PLANNING COMMISSION AND CITY COUNCIL FIND THAT THERE IS A SPOT SPOT THAT THIS IS APPROPRIATE FOR, THEY ARE I'M TRYING TO THINK OF A LEGAL WORD FOR IT BUT I CAN'T SO I WON'T. THEY CAN LEGISLATE AS THEY SEE FIT. SO JUST BECAUSE IT'S NOT INCLUDED IN THE BOUNDARIES DOES NOT MEAN IT CAN'T BE ALSO MAYBE IT'S SOMETHING THAT IN THE BOUNDARIES THAT WE DESCRIBED NOT, THEY DEEM IT NOT APPROPRIATE. AND I THINK ALSO WE'VE TAKEN SOME CARE TO WRITE THE INTENT STATEMENT TO ALLOW THAT LITTLE BIT OF FLEXIBILITY AND INTERPRETATION BY SPEAKING IN GENERALITIES.
01:23:47.930: >> FOLLOW ON TO THAT WE HEARD A COUPLE OF PEOPLE MENTIONED SOUTH INDUSTRIAL AS AN EXAMPLE OF A CORRIDOR THAT'S NOT SPECIFICALLY CALLED OUT IN THE ORDINANCE THAT MIGHT MEET THE CRITERIA. IF WE, IF THE ORDINANCE WERE ADOPTED AS WRITTEN, WOULD A PROPERTY OWNER WITH THE PARCEL ON SOUTH INDUSTRIAL FACE A GREATER HURTLE OR A LARGER BURDEN TO BEING REZONED TC1 THAN SOMEBODY, SAY, ON SOUTH STATE WHO WAS INCLUDED IN THE KIND OF TARGET ZONING? I'M TRYING TO KIND OF JUST UNDERSTAND, YOU KNOW, THE IMPACT OF INCLUSION IN THE LANGUAGE VERSUS NOTS. IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S A KIND OF, IT'S GUIDANCE WHICH IS OFFERED AS A WAY TO ILLUSTRATE THE INTENT BUT NOT TO BE LIMITING. BUT YEAH, MAYBE JUST - -
01:24:47.423: >> UM, SO I WOULD SAY ALL OF THIS PLAYS OUT AND IS APPROVED AS PROSE POOED I WILL SAY A PROPERTY OWNER ON SOUTH INDUSTRIAL WHAT I WOULD SAY TO ANY OTHER DEVELOPER IF THEY HAVE A PROPOSAL THAT IS NOT SUPPORTED BY THE MASTER PLAN, OR IS NOT SUPPORTED BY THE INTENT STATEMENT OF ONE OF THE OTHER DISTRICTS. I WOULD SAY EVERYONE IS ENTITLED TO THEIR DAY IN COURT, SO TO SPEAK. I WILL TAKE YOUR REZONING APPLICATION AND I WILL ANALYZE IT AND SEND IT TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION AND CITY COUNCIL BUT IT IS THE FIRST TEST IS IS IT CONSISTENTEN WITH THE MASTER PLAN AND IS IT THE RIGHT, HAVE YOU PICKED THE RIGHT ZONING DESIGNATION REQUEST. IF IT'S NOT CONSISTENT WITH THE MASTER PLAN, IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO POINT OUT WHY THE PLANNING COMMISSION AND CITY COUNCIL SHOULD THAT MASTER PLAN RECOMMENDATION, AND INSTEAD i PROVE YOUR REZONING REQUEST. SO, AND I WOULD SAY THE SAME THING. IF SOMEBODY CAN MAKE AN ARGUMENT, MAKE A CASE, THAT THEY HAVE SIMILAR CHARACTERISTICS, THAT THE END RESULT WILL ACHIEVE THE GOALS OF THE TC1 DISTRICT, I THINK IT HAS A SHOT, AND BUT IT WOULD BE UP TO THE PLANNIN COMMISSION AND CITY COUNCIL. I DON'T THINK ANYTHING WOULD BE DEAD IN THE WATER FOR SOUTH INSTRIAL, IF EVERYTHING PLAYS OUT AS PROPO. IHINKHOUGH,HAT ITOULD OBABLY TAKE AN EXCEPTIONAL PROPOSAL TO REALLY LAYOUT THE CASE FOR ALL OF THE GOALS THAT ARE MET. I DON'T THINK THAT SOUTH INDUSTRIAL IS NECESSARILY A BAD CORRIDOR FOR ZONING CHANGES.  I JUST THINK THAT IT'S NOT WHAT WE HAVE TAILORED TC1 FOR. I THINK IT NEEDS ITS OWN EITHER ACTUAL AMENDMENT TO THE M1 DISTRICT OR MAYBE IT IT'S TR SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES BUT I THINK THAT DIGRESSES FROM YOUR ACTUAL QUESTION.
01:27:07.896: >> IF I'M HEARING CORRECTLY, THERE WOULD BE AN ADDITIONAL, A GREATER HILL TO CLIMB.
01:27:15.637: >> I WOULD RESPOND TO THAT IN A SIMILAR WAY THAT WITHOUT SOUTH INDUSTRIAL BEING INCLUDED IN THOSE IDENTIFIED CORRIDORS, I WOULD SORT OF RESTATE WHAT ALEXIS WAS SAYING A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY. IF A PROPERTY OWNER CAME TO US AND SAID DO YOU THINK TC1 COULD WORK HERE WE WOULD HAVE THAT CONVERSATION TO SAY WITH THEM OFF THE CUFF IT'S NOT IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A NATURAL REZONING. WHAT IS IT ABOUT YOUR PROJECT THAT YOU THINK IT MEETS THOSE INTENTION, HOW IS IT GOING TO RELATE TO THE SURROUNDING LAND USES, PATTERNS OF THE LIKE. THAT'S QUITE DIFFERENT THAN THE SAME PROJECT COMING IN ONE OF THOSE DESIGNATED AREAS WHERE THERE THAT IS GOING TO BE... THE CITY'S ALREADY MADE BOTH ORDINANCE AND POLICY DECISIONS TO SAY YES, THIS ZONING IS DEEMED APPROPRIATE FOR THESE CORRIDORS IN THIS LOCATION. THAT IS, WHILE I CAN'T PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF PLANNING COMMISSION OR CITY COUNCIL, I WOULD COMMUNICATE THAT SEEMS VERY POSSIBLE TO LIKELY BECAUSE WE HAVE SET THAT DIRECTION AND FROM A DEVELOPMENT PERSPECTIVE THERE'S RISK IN BOTH OF THOSE, BUT THERE IS LESS RISK IN THE ONE THAT COMES WITH A GREATER ASSURANCE OR LIKELIHOOD THAT THAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS. I WOULD SAY YES. BUT IT'S NOT TO SAY THAT WE SHOULDN'T LOOK AT THAT. CERTAINLY IF THE PLANNING COMMISSION THINKS THAT'S APPROPRIATE NOW WE CAN, THAT'S A CHANGE THAT WE CAN DESIGNATE OR THAT MIGHT VERY WELL BE WHAT IS THE NEXT VERSION OF THIS.  THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING THE PLANNING COMMISSION SAYS WE DEFINITELY ARE SURE THAT THE CORRIDORS IDENTIFIED ARE APPROPRIATE, WE'D LIKE TO GET THE BALL MOVING ON THOSE, HOWEVER, LET'S COME BACK TO SOUTH INDUSTRIAL OR OTHER CORRIDORS TO EIS IT THE SAME DISTRICT APPROPRIATE THERE? IF YES THEN THAT COULD FOLLOW. IF NOT, WHAT ARE THE MODIFICATIONS THAT WOULD MAKE IT APPROPRIATE IN THOSE AREAS?
01:29:25.767: >> OKAY. THAT HELPS MY UNDERSTANDING. I HAVE OTHER QUESTIONS BUT I'LL LET OTHER PEOPLE GET IN.
01:29:38.447: >> COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL RANDALL.
01:29:42.050: >> YEAH, I'D LIKE TO FOLLOW ON THAT. WHAT MADE SOUTH INDUSTRIAL, ALEXIS, TO YOU, DIFFERENT THAN THE OTHER CORRIDORS BECAUSE THERE IS BUS SERVICE THERE, OTHER KIND OF DIMENSIONAL ISSUES GOING ON THERE, OR IS IT WHAT THE CALLER WAS REFERRING TO OR ALLUDING TO IS LIKE THE THEY MIGHT END UP PUTTER HURTING — HURTING DISTRICTS BY WE NEED SOME INDUSTRIAL USE.  WHAT WAS IT ABOUT IT THAT MADE IT AN ATTRACTIVE FOR YOU ALL TO CONSIDER THAT AS A POSSIBILITY? I'M JUST CURIOUS. YOU ALL HAVE TAKEN A MUCH DEEPER DIVE THAN I HAVE.  I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR WHAT WERE THE DIFFERENT PARAMETERS THAT LEAD YOU AWAY FROM THAT.
01:30:30.032: >> TWO REASONS PRIMARILY. FIRST IS IT'S SOUTH INDUSTRIAL AND I DON'T THINK THAT RESIDENTIAL USES ARE AS COMPATIBLE AS ADJACENT AMONGST COMMERCIAL AND OFFICE I ALSO THINK THERE'S SOME VALUE OF REMAINING OF KEEPING OF PLACE IN TOWN FOR THOSE USES THAT CAN BE A LITTLE BIT MESSIER THAN THAN TRADITIONAL OFFICE OR COMMERCIAL. THERE'S THE REUSE CENTER, SOME FACILITIES LIKE THAT, AND THEY HAVE OUTDOOR STORAGE AND THINGS LIKE THAT. WE NEED A PLACE FOR THOSE BECAUSE OUR COMMUNITY VALUES THOSE BUSINESSES, WE USE THOSE BUSINESSES, AND I JUST DON'T THINK WHEN YOU LOOK ACROSS THE ENTIRE CITY, I DON'T WANT TO FUNNEL RESIDENTIAL USES THERE WHEN I, WHEN THERE ARE EASIER FITS TO THAT. NOW, THEY DO HAVE GREAT BUS SERVICE ON SOUTH INDUSTRIAL, BUT AND A THIRD WOULD BE IF WE INTRODUCE RESIDENTIAL THERE, THERE'S REALLY NOT MUCH COMMERCIAL.  SO WE'RE GETTING TWO DIFFERENT USES AS PARTS OF THE DEVELOPMENT BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S THE BEST MIX OF USES TO SUPPORT ALL OF YOUR DAILY NEEDS. YOU, YOU KNOW, THERE COULD BE HOUSING THERE, BUT THERE'S NOT THE POTENTIAL FOR, SAY, GROCERY OR PHARMACY AS, SAY, WASHTENAW OR WEST STADIUM HAS. IF YOU LOOK ACROSS THE ENTIRE CITY, THERE'S BETTER FITS TO INTRODUCING MORE VARIETY AND MORE HOUSING THAN SOUTH INDUSTRIAL. NOW, I'M HAPPY TO DISCUSS, BUT THAT'S WHERE I WAS SHYING AWAY FROM APPLYING TC1 ON SOUTH INDUSTRIAL BECAUSE I THINK THAT IT MESHES BETTER WITH THE OTHER DISTRICTS.
01:32:56.845: >> FEEDBACK IS TERRIBLE. MR. CARPENTER HAD HIS HAND RAISED.  IS IT OKAY?
01:33:01.016: >> YEAH, NO, I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR FROM YOU, YEAH.
01:33:04.319: >> THANK YOU, EVERYONE, AND FOR THE PERMISSION TO SORT OF SPEAK OUT OF TURN, CERTAINLY THE TRANSIT SERVICE ON SOUTH INDUSTRIAL IS ROBUST AND NOT GOING ANYWHERE SO IT CAN CERTAINLY SUPPORT THE RIDERSHIP. I WOULD NOTE YOU HAVE AN ACTIVE RAIL CORRIDOR ADJACENT TO THE LOCATION WHICH IS NOT THE BEST NEIGHBOR, AND THEN I JUST WANTED TO REINFORCE SOMETHING ALEXIS SAID. ONE OF THE NOT GREAT NEIGHBORS DOWN THERE IS GOING TO BE US. THE RIDE HAS ITS MAIN GARAGE AT 2700 SOUTH INDUSTRIAL, AND AS A GENERAL RULE I NEVER ATTEMPTS TO PUT A BUS FACILITY NEAR A RESIDENTIAL AREA BECAUSE THE BLOW BACK IS ALMOST ALWAYS FATAL TO THE PROJECT. SIMILARLY, I WOULD URGE AGAINST PUTTING RESIDENTIAL NEAR A BUS GARAGE OR ANY FACILITY LIKE A BUS GARAGE BECAUSE SOMEONE'S GOING TO DECIDE THEY NEED TO OVERHAUL THAT TRANSITION AT 130 IN THE MORNING AND YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR IT FOR A COUPLE OF HUNDRED FEET. THERE ARE INDUSTRIAL USES THAT ARE REALLY NOT ALL THAT COMPATIBLE WITH RESIDENTIAL STUFF AND SOUTH INDUSTRIAL IS ONE OF THE FEW PLACES IN TOWN WHERE THOSE SORTS OF ACTIVITIES CAN OCCUR. THE BUS GARAGE ISN'T GOING ANYWHERE, BUT IT'S CERTAINLY NOT THE THING THAT WOULD MAKE OR BREAK YOUR DECISION ON THIS POINT. JUST AN OBSERVATION.
01:34:39.314: >> MMHM.
01:34:43.218: >> COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL YOU STILL HAVE THE FLOOR.
01:34:44.552: >> THAT'S HELPFUL TO HEAR. I THINK IT IS AGAIN I CAN UNDERSTAND HOW YOU KIND OF NEED A PLACE IN TOWN WHERE THINGS CAN GET A BIT MESSY AND IT'S OKAY. FOR THAT TO HAPPEN BECAUSE THE DIFFERENT USES.  IT IS KIND OF A MIX OF USES THERE.  THERE'S SOME COMMERCIAL IN THERE TOO THAT'S NOT JUST INDUSTRIAL AND THEN ONE OF THE HOUSING COMMISSION IS POTENTIALLY IN THERE TOO WHICH IS VERY REAL ALSO SO IT'S A LITTLE MARGINAL IN WEIRD WAYS AND IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS AWFULLY CLOSE TO TOWN, AND IS ON THE BUS ROUTE SO YOU COULD MAKE AN ARGUMENT THAT IT'S LIKE THIS IS THE WAY ANN ARBOR IS GOING, AND SOME OF ITS USES MAYBE SHOULD BE FURTHER OUTSIDE OF TOWN RATHER THAN IN TOWN, SOMETHING THAT IS SO CONNECTED TO DOWNTOWN, BUT I CAN SEE HOW YOU DO NEED A SPOT FOR SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE A LITTLE ROUGHER AROUND THE EDGES AND ALL OF THEM ARE THAT WAY.  SO THEY'RE NOT BOTHERED BY THAT. SO IT'S HELPFUL FOR ME TO HEAR YOUR THINKING AROUND IT. SO THANKS.
01:35:55.156: >> COMMISSIONER CLARKE.
01:36:00.328: >> CLARIFICATION ON THE REASONING. I'M CURIOUS IF WE MOVE GIVEN JUST GIVEN THE WAY INDUSTRIAL USES ARE GOING AWAY FROM THINGS THAT HAVE EMISSIONS, THINGS LIKE THAT, WE MIGHT BE LIMITING THINGS UNNECESSARILY HERE, LOOKING AT A MAP RIGHT NOW ON GOOGLE AND THERE'S A WHOLE LOT OF I WOULD SAY UNDERUTILIZED SPACE BUTS THERE'S ALSO THINGS LIKE A CHARTER SCHOOL AND I HAVE TO WONDER IF SOME OF THESE SITES NEXT TO THE BUS DEPOT I'M PRETTY SURE DEVELOPERS HAVE A GOOD IDEA NOT A DESIRABLE SITE EITHER I THINK THERE COULD BE OTHER PARCELS FARTHER DOWN ESPECIALLY AS IT GETS CLOSER TO QUITE A FEW DIFFERENT AMENITIES AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE NOT LIMITING OURSELVES UNNECESSARILY ONCE FUTURE HOUSING DOES BECOME MORE DENSE IN THIS AREA IT'D CAN HELP WITH THINGS I THINK THE LUCKY MARKET, CLOSED AROUND THERE. I FEEL LIKE THE GROCERY STORE WOULD BE MORE ABLE TORSO'S ABE IF THERE WAS MORE POPULATION ON THIS SIDE OF TOWN.  BUT THAT'S JUST KIND OF WANTED TO THROW THAT OUT THERE. FIRST, I REALLY WANT DON'T WANT TO POSTPONE IT, SO I DON'T WANT TO SAY ANYTHING THAT WOULD MAKE THAT HAPPEN - - LET ME START WITH MY PROCESS QUESTION.  IF WE DID WANT TO EXPAND TO OTHER AREAS FOR REZONING BUT WE FELT THAT WE NEEDED TO TAKE AAL BIT MORE TIME TO DO A DEEPER LOOK INTO INDUSTRIAL OR PACKARD, WHAT WOULD THAT PROCESS BE? SAY WE PASSED THIS TONIGHT, IS IT UP TO US TO PUT IT ON OUR WORK PLAN TO BE INVESTIGATING THESE OTHER CORRIDORS THAT MIGHT BE READY FOR TC1 OR TC2?
01:38:13.261: >> YES.  SO THAT COULD HAPPEN IN A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT WAYS. IF TO YOUR FIRST POINT IF THIS IS ACTED ON NOW AND PROCEEDS TO CITY COUNCIL AND CITY COUNCIL TAKES SIMILAR ACTION, ONE THING THAT COULD HAPPEN IS CITY COUNCIL COULD NOT UNLIKE THE RESOLUTION YOU'RE RESPONDING TO NOW SAY NOW THAT THE ZONING ISSUE HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED PLANNING COMMISSION WE WANT YOU TO GO BACK AND IDENTIFY THE FIRST AREA THAT SHOULD BE REZONED TO THIS.  THAT COULD HAPPEN IN THAT BAY. ALTERNATIVELY YOU ARE THE PLANNINGOMMISSION. YOU CAN DIRECT THAT WORK AS WELL. YOU COULD RESOLVE THAT, THIS IS A GREAT FIRST STEP BUT ON WHATEVER TIME FRAME AND PRIORITIZATION OF YOUR OTHER PLANS, YOU COULD SAY NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS FOR OTHER CORRIDORS.  WE'D LIKE TO FOCUS IN ON ADDING CORRIDORS OR ADJUSTING IT. IT COULD HAPPEN EITHER WAY. SO YOU COU BE DIRTED B I IT'S SOMHING THAT YOU AS THE TERESTED IN, IOULD SAY Y DON'T HAVE TO WAIT FOR THAT. YOU JUST START AT WORK.
01:39:22.864: >> KAI. I GUESS I WOULD SAY WHETHER OR NOT WE WERE DIRECTED I WOULD IF WE VOTE ON THIS AS IT IS TONIGHT I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN OPENING UP CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW TO APPLY IT TO OTHER CORRIDORS.  I THINK WE'RE HEARING LOT THAT PEOPLE ARE REALLY INTERESTED IN EXPANDING THIS.  I THINK ALEXIS HAS DONE AMAZING AND DETAIL WORK ON THESE PARTICULAR CORRIDORS SO I DON'T WANT TO HOLD IT UP OVER A QUESTION OVER WHETHER OR NOT IT APPLIES TO INDUSTRIAL FOR EXAMPLE. THE POINT OF INDUSTRIAL, THOUGH, WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE TO AGAIN LOOKING AT THE MAP KNOWING THE STREET, THE NORTHERN HALF OF IT, SEEMS LIKE THIS MIGHT ACTUALLY FIT. DO WE HAVE ANY CONSTRAINTS ON THE LENGTHS OF THIS ZONE?  OR WAS IT REALLY JUST MORE ABOUT THE DISTANCE TO TRANSIT?  SO WE COULD APLOY IT TO A HALF MILE LENGTH IF THAT'S THE BEST?  DUH THAT MAKE SENSE?
01:40:13.414: >> YEAH.  THERE'S NO LENGTH PARAMETER AT: IT'S MORE OF THE WHAT IS THE EXISTING, WHAT IS THE UNDERLYING ZONING.  THERE IS A DESCRIPTION ABOUT DEPTH, HOW DEEP IT SHOULD GO OFF THE CORRIDOR PUTTED BUT IT'S MORE MORE ABOUT DEPTH. THE DEPTH IS BECAUSE WALKING DISTANCE TO THE FRONT HALF. ALONG THE LENGTH OF THE CORRIDOR IS NOT SPECIFIED. YOU TAKE TUT O AS FAR AS YOU NEED TO GO UNTIL YOU HIT THAT NEXT LAND USE WHERE IT'S APPROPRIATE TO STOP.  THE NORTH END OF SOUTH INDUSTRIAL HAS COMMERCIAL ZONING. ESPECIALLY THE CHUNK BETWEEN STADIUM AND SIMPSON. THAT'S WHERE YOU'LL FIND THE COMMERCIAL ZONING. AND I THINK THAT IS THE TYPE OF AREA WHERE THE INTENT STATEMENTS ARE BROAD ENOUGH.  IF SOMEBODY CAME IN AND SAID I'M ALREADY COMMERCIALLY ZONED, ONE OF MY PARCELS IS INDUSTRIAL, BUT THIS IS WHAT IS SURROUNDING, I'M ALREADY ON A BUS LINE, THAT'S THE TYPE OF CANDIDATE THAT I CAN SEE MAKING A CONVINCING ARGUMENT. I'M NOT DESCRIBED BUT I SHARE ALL THE CHARACTERISTICS. AND I THINK THAT PETITION SHOULD BE TAKEN VERY SERIOUSLY. I JUST, I DON'T THINK THOUGH THAT A PETITION FARTHER SOUTH RIGHT NEXT TO THE RIDE FACILITY SHOULD BE, IS IS AS STRONG OF A CANDIDATE. SOMEONE SAID WELL, THE SPOT RIGHT NEXT TO THE RIDE, THAT'S PROBABLY A CHEAPER PARCEL THAN ANYWHERE ELSE IN TOWN BECAUSE IT'S RIGHT NEXT TO THE RIDE. AND THERE'S ALL OF THE REST OF THE CITY TO CONSIDER WELL WHAT IS THE BEST FIT AND I THINK THAT IF WE WOULD REZONE THE ENTIRE SOUTH INDUSTRIAL CORRIDOR WE WOULD PROBABLY SEE RESIDENTIAL VERY FAST BECAUSE IT'S AMONG THE CHEAPEST PROPERTY IN TOWN BECAUSE IT'S RIGHT NEXT TO A BUS GARAGE. I THINK THERE'S A BIT OF AN EQUITY ISSUE HERE AS AS WELL. OF ALL THE AREA IN TOWN, THAT'S THE HILL THAT YOU'RE GOING TO STAND ON FOR RESIDENTIAL? I'M NOT CONVINCED. THAT'S THAT'S WHERE TC1 SHOULD GO, THAT THAT'S WHERE IT SHOULD GO FOR THOSE REASONS.
01:43:11.292: >> ALSO FROM A PUBLIC HEALTH STANDPOINT, NO OFFENSE, THAT IS NOT THE BEST PLACE TO PUT A RESIDENTIAL USE.
01:43:17.064: >> NO OFFENSE TAKEN.
01:43:18.966: >> I'M SURE IT'S BEAUTIFUL GARAGE. MY SECOND QUESTION, WHEN YOU SAID THAT CITY COUNCIL COULD DIRECT US TO IDENTIFY THE PRIORITIES FOR REZONING, SO MY QUESTION IS GOING TO BE I DON'T KNOW HOW EVERYBODY ELSE FEELS, I FEEL WE SHOULD PROACTIVELY BE REZONING THESE RATHER THAN WAITING FOR PEEP TOOL COME TO US, AND I KNOW THERE'S A PUBLIC PARTICIPATION PROCESS AND THERE'S A PROCESS INVOLVED IN THAT. SO I GUESS I WAS JUST CURIOUS YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT PROCESS. IS THAT SOMETHING THAT CITY COUNCIL WOULD TYPICALLY DIRECT US TO DO OR AGAIN IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WE COULD DECIDE, PLANNING COMMISSION, WE PASS THIS AND NOW WE SAY OKAY NOW WE WANT TO START THE PROCESS FOR ACTUALLY REZONING THESE CORRIDORS?
01:44:09.317: >> I GUESS I WOULD JUST - -
01:44:11.986: >> EITHER WAY.
01:44:12.653: >> YEAH, EITHER WAY. I'D SUGGEST IF YOU AND THE PLANNING COMMISSION FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT THAT, THAT'S YOUR ROLE AS THE COUNCIL. IF YOU ARE RESOLUTE THAT THE COMMISSION BELIEVES WE SHOULD START PROACTIVELY ZONING PROPERTIES TO THIS, WOULD SUGGEST YOU START ON THAT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE SORT OF BENEFIT WOULD BE WAITING TO SEE IF THAT DIRECTION COMES. IT COULD HAPPEN EITHER WAY. MAYBE IT COMES MAYBE YOU ESTABLISH THAT IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT TO DO BUT IT'S AFTER SOME OTHER LARGE-SCALE ORDINANCE AMENDMENTS YOU WANT TO TACKLE FIRST. THE CITY COUNCIL COULD SAY WE WANT YOU TO DO THIS FIRST. BUT GENERALLY MY ADVICE WOULD BE IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE PLANNING COMMISSION FEELS STRONGLY ABOUT, TAKE THAT INITIATIVE. YOU HAVE EVERY ABILITY TO PUT FORTH RECOMMENDATIONS AS THE PLANNING COMMISSION THAT YOU THINK BETTER THE LAND USE PLANNING AND REGULATION IN THE EAT AND JUST GET STARTED ON IT.
01:45:15.416: >> OKAY, I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR EVERYBODY'S THOUGHTS ON IT. BUT I THINK ONCE THIS PASSES CITY COUNCIL WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR THAT. I WOULD LIKE TO START TALKING ABOUT, LIKE, WHAT THE THE THE PROCESS WOULD BE TO ACTUALLY REZONE. A LOT OF THESE CORRIDORS.  I ALSO JUST A COUPLE OF CALLERS I THINK MAYBE JUST ONE MENTIONED SOMETHING ABOUT A CONCERN AABOUT UNLIMITED HEIGHT.  I WANTED TO EXTRA CLARIFY TO EVERYONE THAT WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT UNLIMITED HEIGHT WITH THIS ZONE. AND THEN COUPLE OF PEOPLE MENTIONED THE 3 -F STORY HEIGHT ON TOWN HOMES AND I KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT THIS AT ORC, BUT IT STRUCK ME AGAIN WHEN I WAS LOOKING AT THE TABLE, LIKE, I'D BE OKAY WITH JUMPING BACK DOWN TO TWO. ONE OF THE CALLERS TALKING ABOUT A THREE-STORY TOWN HOME THAT ESPECIALLY CONCERNED ME I COULD SEE THAT HAPPENING AND JUST GETTING GIANT HOMES I DON'T THINK THAT WAS THE INTENT OF IT. BUT BE ABLE TO HEAR WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK ABOUT THAT.  THAT'S IT FOR NOW.
01:46:19.413: >> COMMISSIONER SAW SAUVE, I I THINK AWERE IN LINE NEXT AND THEN COMMISSIONER DISCH.
01:46:25.987: >> I'LL GET ON THAT SOUTH INDUSTRIAL HILL AND I THINK A COUPLE OF THE REASONS ALEXIS YOU MADE THE ARGUMENT OF IN OTHER AREAS IF I'M NOT CREATE UNDUE BURDEN TO REMOVE THE SPECIFIC PURPOSE STATEMENT AND HAVE A VERY CLEAR GENERAL INTENT STATEMENT ALLOWS TRUSTEE CONTI TO JUST SAY THESE ARE THE EXPECTATIONS AND BOXES THAT WE CHECKED AND IT'S IF YOU CHECKED THEM GREAT. YOU ALL MEET THAT REVIEW REZONING IS ALWAYS OF DISCRETION WHEN WE REVIEW THIS WITH THE MASTER PLAN. YOU'VE DONE THE GREAT HOMEWORK FOR THE MASTER PLAN THAT IT'S RIGHT AT OUR HANDS TO REVIEW EVERY SITE REGARDLESS OF ITS CORRIDOR LOCATION TO EIF IT MATCHES BASED ON THIS. SO I THINK A TIGHTER GENERAL INTENT STATEMENT REMOVING THOSE CORRIDORS STILL GIVES US THE CROSS CHECK TO MEET A LOT OF THE REQUIREMENTS AND GOALS OF THIS THING. WE HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS SO IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOUSING COMMISSION WHEN POOTS AND — THAT DOES MEAN OUR HOUSING GOALS. JUST BECAUSE IT'S BETTER FIT IN OTHER AREAS IF WE HAVE ECONOMIC LAND WHICH I ALSO DON'T BELIEVE, INDUSTRIAL MANUFACTURE LAND REAL ESTATE HAS SKY ROCKETEDDED OVER THE PAST YEAR, IF WE DO HAVE LAND ANYWHERE THAT CHECKS THE BOXES IT SHOULD BE A PRIORITY TO MAKE HOUSING.  AND AND I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD RESTRICT IT. THAT'S WHERE I STAND. I LOOK TO THE FUTURE OF THIS AND HOW WE EXPAND IT BEYOND FRONTING THE CORRIDORS AS WELL. I THINK TWO-STORY TOWN HOMES BEHIND ALL OF THIS ZONING ALONG THE CORRIDORS IS THE PERFECT SCENARIO TO KIND OF COPY AND PASTE SOME OF THAT BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HIGHER DENSITY RESIDENTIAL BEHIND THESE CORRIDORS SO THAT WE CAN INCENTIVIZE TRUE MIXED USE ON THESE CORRIDORS. I SEE THAT AS THE NEXT PHASE BUT FOR ME I'M IN THE REMOVAL OF THESE LITTLE ZONES AND THE GENERAL INTENT STATEMENT TIGHTENED UP IS GOING TO DO A LOT OF THAT WORK FOR US AND GIVE US MORE OPPORTUNITIES, HOW DEVELOPERS CAN DO A LAND ASSEMBLY, WHERE THOSE OPPORTUNITIES MIGHT LIE AND MISS AREAS WE MIGHT NEVER THOUGHT OF, BUT WE STILL HAVE A REVIEW PROCESS IN PLACE AT THIS POINT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT MATCHES.  I THINK PUTTING THOSE GUIDELINES IN PLACE AND OPENING UP THE OPPORTUNITY IS WHAT WE NEED TO DO FOR THE HOUSING CRISIS. SO THAT'S WHERE I'M AT.
01:49:15.422: >> COMMISSIONER DISCH.
01:49:17.091: >> COMMISSIONER DISCH:  SO, I WOULD LOVE TO ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT THE VALUE OF THE PARCELS ARE ALONG SOUTH INDUSTRIAL.  BECAUSE WHILE I AGREE WE HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS AND WE SHOULD PUT THINGS WHEREVER WE CAN THE MARKET WOULD DRIVE TO THE CHEAPER STUFF FIRST AND I DON'T NECESSARILY WANT MULTIFAMILY HOUSING AND NOT ON STATE STREET WHEN STATE STREET IS AVAILABLE TOO. AS WE HAVE GONE THROUGH EVALUATING THE AFFORDABLE PROJECTS ON CITY-OWNED LAND, THERE ARE THESE VERY STRICT REQUIREMENTS FROM THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT ABOUT WHERE YOU CAN LOCATE THINGS. AND IF WE'RE OPENING UP OPPORTUNITIES I WANT THESE TO BE DESIRABLE OPPORTUNITIES AND NOT THE BOTTOM OF THE BARREL OPPORTUNITIES, AND I'M AFRAID THAT THE MARKET GIVES US THE BOTTOM OF THE BARREL FIRST. THIS WOULD ALL BE CONTINGENT. LISA YOU'RE SUGGESTING THOSE PARCELS MAY NOT BE AS CHEAP AS WE THINK. I SUSPECT THE ONE NEXT TO THE BUS GARAGE WILL BE A BURDEN BUT I ALSO TAKE THE POINT THAT MAYBE WE WOULD JUST BE ZONING NORTH INDUSTRIAL NEAR THE COMMERCIAL USES TC1.  I'D LIKE TO HEAR MORE ABOUT THAT AS WE GO ON AND EVALUATE MORE SITES. I DID WANT TO PUT ON THE TABLE FOR DISCUSSION THE SUGGESTS OF EXTENDING PLYMOUTH AND I GUESS ALSO I GUESS BEYOND TO THE HOSPITAL I'M WONDERING IF THAT'S A CONCERN BECAUSE OF BUS SERVICE OR, YEAH, IF THERE WAS A REASON. THAT'S DEFINITELY A BURGEONING COMMERCIAL AREA. THERE ARE GROCERY STORES, THERE ARE RESTAURANTS, AND THEN THERE ARE A BUNCH OF DORMS AND AS MUCH AS I LOVE STUDENTS IT WOULD ALSO BE NICE IF LECTURERS AND PEOPLE WHO MAKE MY COFFEE AT THE COFFEE SHOP THERE COULD LIVE ALONG THAT CORRIDOR.  I'M JUST WONDERING WHAT THE THOUGHT WAS ON LIMITING THE PLYMOUTH EXTENT.
01:52:00.454: >> I CAN SAY THAT I TOOK OUTHE PLYMTHORDO AS PROPOD ENCOMPASSES THE EXISTING DISTRICTS THAT WE'RE SEEKING TO REPLACE. WE CAN RELOOK AT THE MAP AGAIN, MAYBE IT SHOULD GO DOWN TO MURR -F.  THAT MURR -F, UPLAND, PLYMOUTH NODE IN THE COURTYARD DEVELOPMENT. I'D HAVE TO THINK MORE OF WHETHER MAYBE IT SHOULD EXTEND ALL THE WAY DOWN TO BROADWAY AND MAIDEN LANE AND WALL STREET AREA. I THINK THAT IS MORE OF A NODE AND SHOULD GET A DIFFERENT TREATMENT THAN OUR VISION FOR A TRACTION -T CORRIDOR.
01:53:05.019: >> PLEASE DO CONSIDER. IT'S NOT JUST COURT YARD SHOPS THAT IS GREAT BUT THEN THERE'S THE PANERA AND THEN THE MOSQUE AND A LITTLE BIT FURTHER THEN YOU GET THE KROGER, AND THEN YOU GET THE SALAD PLACE AND THE STARBUCKS AND ALL OF THAT. SO THAT'S GOTTEN, THEY GOT REVITALIZED AFTER PFIZER LEFT AND IT SHUT DOWN IT GOT REVITALIZED.
01:53:37.885: >> I THINK PRETTY MUCH EVERYBODY ELSE HAS WEIGHED IN I'LL WEIGH IN AND SAY I HAVE THE SAME QUESTIONS.  IN GOING BACK AND REVIEWING THE STAFF REPORT ON THE MASTER PLAN, THERE ARE CORRIDOR STUDIES FOR THREE OF THE FOUR THAT ARE NAMED THAT CALL FOR THIS AND I FEEL LIKE IN TERMS OF LINKING PASTOR PLAN TO GENERATION OF A ZONING DISTRICT TO THEN PROACTIVE ZONING, THAT'S INHERENT IN THOSE AND EASY TO JUSTIFY.  I WOULDN'T GO AS FAR AS WHAT COMMISSIONER SAUVE RECOMMENDED WHICH IS CUT OUT KIND OF THE SPECIFICS, BUT I WOULD ACTUALLY WEAKEN SOME OF THE SPECIFICS. THERE IS LIKE, THE WORD ONLY IS USED MULTIPLE TIMES AND I THINK THAT IS TIEING OUR HANDS PERHAPS A LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH AND I CAN MAKE THOSE SUGGESTIONS A LITTLE BIT LATER BUT I'D LIKE TO PUT IT OUT THERE. ONLY THE WHAT IF THERE IS AN R4B THAT IS SURROUNDED BY EVERYTHING ELSE? IN MY MIND THAT OUGHT TO BE ON THE TABLE IF SOMEBODY'S ASSEMBLING ALL OF THOSE PARCELS. I WOULD MOVE TOWARDS CUTTING THAT PART TO MAKE IT, MAKE THE BAR NOT QUITE SO HIGH FOR THE INDUSTRIALS ALSO THIS IS THE IDEA OF LIKE WE DON'T IMMEDIATELY TRANSLATE A MASTER PLAN INTO A ZONING ORDINANCE. IT TAKES TIME. WE HAVE A TOME OF MASTER PLANNING TO ENACT WHAT WAS IN REIMAGINE WASHTENAW AND THE STATE STREET CORRIDOR. THERE ARE SOME PLACES WHERE I THINK WE'D PROBABLY NEED TO BEFORE WE'RE PROACTIVE IN REZONING PERHAPS INDUSTRIAL WHERE I'D LIKE TO GIVE IT MORE THOUGHT. LIKE, IN TERMS OF GOING BACK AND SEEING IF THE SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS WITHIN THE MASTER PLAN STILL FIT OR ASKING FOR MORE MASTER PLANNING.  I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO DO THAT FOR THIS WHOLE THING. WE HAVE TONS OF MASTER PLANS SUGGESTIONS WE HAVEN'T IMPLEMENTED YET. AND THE CORRIDORS WE'RE LISTING RIGHT NOW ARE AMONG THOSE THAT WE'RE FINALLY GETTING AROUND TO IT BUT I THINK I WOULD LEAN TOWARDS STICKING WITH THE CORRIDORS THAT WE LISTED BUT WEAKENING SOME OF THE WHERE ELSE IT COULD BE APPLIED AND TAKING OUT SOME OF THOSE ONLIES IN THE SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS. SO TO THAT END, I DON'T DISAGREE WITH THE KIND OF CHARACTERISTICS OF PLYMOUTH BLOT I'M WONDERING THAT WASN'T IN THE MASTER PLAN KIND OF PART OF IN THE PART OF THE STAFF REPORT, ALEXIS, AND I'M WONDERING IF THERE WERE, YOU ARE MUCH MORE FAMILIAR WITH THE TOME.  THE MULTIVOLUME MASTER PLAN THAT WE HAVE IS THAT FROM THE NORTHEAST AREA PLAN OR IN PART TO GET GET TO COMMISSIONER DISCH'S POINT ABOUT WHERE YOU DRAW THE LINE FOR THAT PARTICULAR CORRIDOR.
01:57:01.855: >> I BELIEVE THAT THERE, THERE'S NO LONGER A NORTHEAST AREA PLAN. IT'S A CHAPTER OF THE LAND USE ELEMENT WHICH IS IN ITSELF A PIECE OF THE MASTER PLAN. THERE ARE SOME SITE-SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS THROUGHOUT THE OLD NORTHEAST, THE NORTHEAST PART OF TOWN.  THERE ARE SOME SITE-SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS. I FEEL LIKE THERE IS ONE THAT THE PLYMOUTH QUADRANT. I DON'T RECALL WHAT IT SAYS OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD. MY GUESS IS IT DOESN'T USE THE WORD TRANSIT CORRIDOR, MY GUESS IS THAT IT PROBABLY SAYS, GIVES A MIXED USE COMMERCIAL RECOMMENDATION IS WHAT MY GUESS IS. I THINK THE PHRAB. I FEEL CONFIDENT THAT THE PLANNING, WHATEVER IS SPECIFIC IN THE MASTER PLAN IS GOING TO TALK ABOUT THAT AS A NODE AND IT IS DISTINCT FROM THE PLYMOUTH COMMERCIAL CORRIDOR BUT I WILL DO THAT FOLLOW THROUGH AND RESEARCH. I THINK WE'LL SEE WHAT AMENDMENTS GET MADE AND DIRECTION OF PLANNING COMMISSION. I THINK THAT MAYBE THIS... IS NOT THE RIGHT WORD. I SEE THE DIRECTION MIGHT BE THAT THE INTENT STATEMENTS GET SLIGHTLY WEAKENED, BROADENED SO I THINK IF WE DO RELATIVELY MAAEDEST CHANGES TO THE ACTUAL LANGUAGE, I THINK THERE'S SUPPORT THERE IF SOMEBODY COMES IN WITH A GREAT PROPOSAL FOR AN AREA OUTSIDE OF MY MAPS FOR ILLUSTRATIVE PURPOSES THEN THEY MEET THE CHARACTERISTICS. THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE A STRONG ARGUMENT. ALTERNATIVELY, WHEN IT COMES TIME TO DO A REZONING, IT CAN BE INCLUDED.  IT CAN BE STUDIED. FLUSH. AND THEN THE BURDEN WOULD NOT BE ON THE DEVELOPER TO COME IN WITH A STRONG CASE.  WE CAN MAKE THAT CASE FOR THEM ON THEIR BEHALF.
01:59:20.961: >> IN TERMS OF THE OVERALL SPECIFIC WE'VE BEEN FOCUSING ON SPECIFIC CORRIDORS BUT I THINK ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT I WAS CURIOUS ABOUT WAS NUMBER THREE OF THE SPECIFIC PURPOSE STATEMENT, NUMBER ONE ABOUT THE DISTRICTS.
01:59:42.149: >> BELL WITH THE ONLY THAT'S RIGHT FOR THOSE ODD R4BS THE ONE THAT WE SAW IN WASHTENAW, BUT THE ONE I'M CURIOUS WHY IT'S NOT IN THIS LIST IS THE P PARKING DISTRICT BECAUSE THAT ACTUALLY SEEMS LIKE COMPLETELY CONTRARY TO WHAT WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE HERE.  AND SO WE KNOW THAT IT'S KIND OF THERE'S ODD P PLACES AROUND THE CITY SO I'M CURIOUS WHY THAT DIDN'T MAKE THE LIST. YEAH.
02:00:10.410: >> I THOUGHT THAT THE LANGUAGE THAT, I THOUGHT THAT THE LANGUAGE ABOUT THINGS THAT ARE WHOLLY SURROUNDED BY AND CONTIGUOUS, I THINK THAT COVERS THE P DISTRICT. I WILL SAY THAT SO THE P DISTRICT HAS BEEN AROUND FOREVER, SINCE THE 60S AND IT WAS USED AS BUFFER. IT WAS USED SO THAT THE PARKING WENT IN THE REAR AND NO COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS WENT IN IT BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE BUFFER LANGUAGE IN THE LANDSCAPE ORDINANCE.  IT WAS USED AS A BUFFER.  WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY BUFFERS.  WE ADDED BUFFERS, NEVER WENT BACK AND REZONED THE P DISTRICTS. WE TRADITIONALLY IF A PROJECT WAS BEING REDEVELOPED AND IT HAS THAT SPLIT ZONING ON IT, BECAUSE YOU MIGHT NOTICE THE P DISTRICT IS ALMOST IN A SEEP LOGICAL PARCEL. IT'S A SINGLE PARCEL WITH SPLIT ZONING, COMMERCIAL IN THE FRONT, P IN THE BACK OR THE SIDE SO THE PLANNING COMMISSION AND CITY COUNCIL HAS HONORED THE ZONING REQUEST TO MAKE A UNIFORM PARCEL, WE JUST RECENTLY DID IT FOR A 2111PACKARD. THE CONCEPT OF P IS OFTEN A LEGACY. A HISTORY LESSON ASIDE, I THINK THAT IF A PROJECT CAME IN, IF WE DIDN'T DO REZONING, THE DEVELOPER CAME IN AND ASSEMBLED A GROUPING AND SAID I HAVE ALL OF THIS LAND, I DO HAVE ONE PARCEL THAT'S PARTIALLY ZONED P, THEY'VE GOT A GREAT CASE. I WOULD TRUST THE PLANNING COMMISSIONS AND CITY COUNCIL WOULD SAY I'M STILL GOING TO REZONE THIS EVEN THOUGH THE STATEMENT DOESN'T SAY P, I SEE WHERE THIS IS ALL FITTING TOGETHER NICELY.
02:02:00.854: >> I THINK THAT SIMILARLY LINKS TO MY EDIT THAT I WOULD FLOAT TO MAKE TO NUMBER TWO, WHICH IS THAT IT SHALL ONLY BE LOCATED FRONTING A CORRIDOR DISTRICT. WE CAN SAY IT SHOULD BE LIMITED THE INCLUSION PROVIDES WAY MORE EMPHASIS THAN WHAT I THINK I'M WILLING TO CONSIDER. AND SO AND AGAIN LIKE I WANT OUR ZONING ORDINANCE TO BE CLEAR TO PEOPLE IF YOU'VE GOT P ON THE BACK LOT, THAT'S ELIGIBLE TOO. I WOULD BE MORE COMFORTABLE SAYING P IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S ELIGIBLE. I WOULD BE MORE COMFORTABLE SAYING IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE ABUTTING AND I DO THINK THAT OUR DISTANCE OUR PROXIMITY TO A STOCK COVERS US THERE.  DOE THOSE ARE THE SO THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF AMENDMENTS I COULD IMAGINE FOR SUPPORT AMONGST OTHERS.  BUT THAT'S IN THE YEAH, THAT'S IN THE OVERALL PURPOSE I'VE GOT MORE ON THE REST BUT I'LL... OTHER PEOPLE HAVE THINGS ON PURPOSE COMMISSIONER ABRONS.
02:03:22.202: >> I THINK PART FOR ME WHAT FEELS CONFUSING ABOUT THE CLEAR PATH FORWARD IS THIS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CLOSING ZONE AND THE CITY INITIATED REZONING.  SO LIKE IF IT'S THE FLOATING ZONING WE TALK ABOUT IT WITH THIS CAVEAT WE CAN THEN VERY QUICKLY MOVE TO CITY INITIATED REZONING. IF IT'S THE FLOATING ZONE I WOULD AGREE WITH COMMISSIONER SAUVE THAT WE WOULD HAVE CERTAIN BOXES OR CRITERIA TO MEET. IT'S JUST KIND OF LESS IMPORTANT. I THING IF IT'S OBVIOUSLY A CITY INITIATED REZONING YOU HAVE TO THINK VERY CAREFULLY ABOUT NOT JUST THE AREAS THAT ARE BEING REZONED BUT I THINK PROBABLY ALSO LOOKING AT THINGS LIKE THE USE TABLE MORE CAREFULLY BECAUSE THERWOULD BE THINKING AABOUT INDUSTRIAL, THERE ARE USES THERE THAT ARE NOT ALLOWED IN TC1 THAT WOULD SUDDENLY BE NON NON-CONFORMING. THAT WOULD HAPPEN A LOT ANYWAY WITH DRIVE THRUS SO I THINK IT WOULD HELP ME TO JUST IS EVERYBODY ASSUMING THAT FOR THE NEAR TERM THIS IS FLOATING AND THAT'S HOW YOU'RE EVALUATING THIS ORDINANCE OR ARE YOU DOING IT WITH AN ASSUMPTION OR AN EXPECTATION THAT VERY QUICKLY BECOMES CITY-INITIATED?  BECAUSE FOR ME THAT FEELS LIKE A REALLY IMPORTANT DISTINCTION. IF WE GO AROUND AND ANSWER IN TURN. I'LL JUST SAY I THINKF WE'RE DOG IT AS A FLOATING ZONE, W WE SULD MAY ARESS IT. A AND HOW WE SHOULD ADDRESS IT CURRENTLY, I WOULD BE I THINK IN FAVOR OF LESS SPECIFIC LANGUAGE, LESS LIMITING LANGUAGE AND USE THE OTHER CRITERIA THAT ARE IN THE INTENT STATEMENT AND THEN AND THING LIKE THE HEIGHT LIMIT TO LIMIT WHAT IT COULD BE.
02:05:36.302: >> I'M GLAD YOU GOT THERE, I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR THIS IS A FLOATING DISTRICT SO THAT'S WHAT'S BEING CONSIDERED. YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.  FROZER Y REZONING ACCOMPANYING IT. I WOULD JUST ADD TO TO THE IN THAT CONTEXT I THINK THE DISCUSSION ABOUT NOT BEING TOO LIMITING WITH THE INTENT STATEMENT AND I'VE GOT A, I'M TAKING NOTES TOO IF WE WANT TO GET TO SOME MODIFICATIONS THIS EVENING, BUT I WOULD JUST, YOU KNOW, TO GO BACK TO ZONING AS A LEGISLATIVE DECISION, ON ONE HAND I THINK THIS INTENT STATEMENT IS GOING TO BE USED IN THAT REGARD, ADS AN INTENT STATEMENT. IT IS NOT GOING TO BE GUARANTEED PATH TOWARDS APPROVAL NOR DENIAL. IT'S GOING TO BE USED IN THE CONTEXT OF MAKING THAT LEGISLATIVE DECISION BOY THE COUNCIL AND YOUR RECOMMENDATION OF OF THE SAME. I THINK THAT I PERSONALLY LIKE THE STRUCTURE NOW THAT IDENTIFIES THAT IT MIGHT HAVE BROADER APPLICABILITY, BUT IT ALSO COMMUNICATES AN EXPECTATION OF LIKELIHOOD FOR SOME VERY SPECIFIC AREAS WHICH WE BY THIS INTENT SECTION IS SORT OF AGAIN I WANT TO BE CLEAR, THAT'S NOT A GUARANTEE THAT A REZONING WILL HAPPEN, BUT IT'S THE SAIL CITY CITY SAYING INVITING PROPERTY OWNERS IN THESE GEOGRAPHIES TO SEEK REZONING TO THIS DESIGNATION. AND TO LOSE THAT AT THE BENEFIT OF SOMETHING MORE GENERAL, AGAIN, I'M FOUGHT SAYING IT - - I'M NOT SAYING IT CHANGES THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS OR ULTIMATE DECISIONS, BUT I THINK IT IS MISSING AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE CLEAR TO SAY, YOU KNOW, WE WELCOME THE REVIEW OF YOUR PETITION IN THESE GEOGRAPHIES.  IT'S NOT TO SAY WE WON'T CONSIDER IT ELSEWHERE, BUT HERE WE CAN'T WAIT TO SEE IT. WE CAN'T WAIT TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION. SO I WOULD JUST, THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I SEE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE BALANCE OF I THINK THE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT ONLY AND THE LIKE ARE WORTHWHILE TO EXPLORE TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT FLEXIBILITY DOES HAPPEN, BUT I ALSO THINK THAT ALSO INCLUDING THESE MORE SPECIFIC AREAS IS SORT OF A STEP, IT'S SORT OF A STEP IN A WAY IN BETWEEN THE FLOATING ZONE AND PROACTIVELY ZONING THINGS SAYING WE ENCOURAGE YOUR APPLICATION IN THESE AREAS BY ADOPTION -F CODE OF THAT SAYS SO. I THINK YOUR POINTS ARE RELEVANT. THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT WILL BE REZONED, BUT IT IS A STEP, A WELCOMING STEPS TOWARDS THAT.
02:08:27.473: >> IN THAT CASE, I WOULD ALSO BE IN FAVOR OF LOOSENING UP SOME OF THE LANGUAGE TO BE LESS RESTRICTIVE OUT OF THE GATE. AND MAYBE IN ADDITION TO IEP WONDERING ABOUT ADDING R5 WHICH IS HOTEL., RIGHT? BUT THEN THAT OPENS MAYBE A CAN OF WORMS BECAUSE WE SAY NOW SHOULDN'T REPLACE RESIDENTIAL. OR IN THE INTENT STATEMENT IT SAYS ESTABLISH COMMERCIAL AND OFFICE SITES, I DON'T KNOW IF R5 WOULD COUNT AS COMMERCIAL.
02:09:06.546: >> R5 IS COMMERCIAL IT IS NOT GROUPED AMONG THE RESIDENTIAL.
02:09:10.350: >> GREAT.
02:09:11.150: >> IT IS A SPECIAL PURPOSE.
02:09:13.152: >> SO NOT A CAN OF WORMS. I GUESS SIMILARLY ALOUT BOT - - ABOUT THE TRANSIT CORRIDOR THAT WAS ALSO SOMETHING THAT I HIGHLIGHTED AS BEING RESTRICTIVE I GUESS COMMISSIONER MILLS YOU'RE SAWING REMOVING THE WORD ONLY WOULD HELP.  I'M WONDERING SOMETHING LIKE PRIMARILY. I DON'T KNOW THE DISTRICT SHOULD REPLACE THESE? I DON'T KNOW.  WE COULD DEBATE THAT. I WOULD SUPPORT THE OTHER COMMISSIONERS WHO SUGGESTED WE ALLOW A LITTLE MORE LATITUDE IN THE LANGUAGE THEN OF THE PURPOSE STATEMENT.
02:10:05.571: >> I FEEL LIKE COMMISSIONER SAUVE - -
02:10:09.776: >> COMMISSIONER SAUVE:  I JUST, I THINK BEING VERY SPECIFIC ON THE CORRIDORS SENDS THE OTHER SIGNAL NOT AS AB INVITATION BUT AN EXCLUSION TO OTHERS PROPERTIES THAT MIGHT BE POTENTIAL AND THAT IT WILL BE HARDER TO MAKE THAT CONVINCING ARGUMENT OF WHAT THAT CHANGE WOULD BE ON EXTENDED AREAS OF STADIUM OF STRAIGHT STREET. MORE NORTH ON STATE STREET. I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF AREAS WHERE WHEN WE OUTLINE WHERE WE WANT IT WE BASICALLY SAY WHERE WE DON'T WANT IT AND I THINK THERE'S A LOT MORE PARCELS WITH POTENTIAL THAT I DON'T THINK ARE THE LOWEST DENOMINATOR, AND IF THEY'RE THAT BAD, THE MARKET WOULDN'T ACCOMMODATE THE HOUSING ANYWAY. MAKING HOUSINGVAILABLE, STRIKING THREE FROM THE SPECIFIC PURPOSE STATEMENT I THINK IS THE WAY TO STILL CREATE A WHOLE LOT OF PARAMETERS ABOUT THE GOALS OF A TRANSIT DISTRICT WITHOUT COMPLETELY RESTRICTING IT. I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY AND A LOT OF DEVELOPERS LOOKING AT THIS AS A TOOL IN FRINGE AREAS OUTSIDE OF THESE VERY TIGHTLY WOUNDED AREAS. THOSE ARE CONVERSATIONS I'VE BEEN HAVING THAT PEOPLE ARE CURIOUS ABOUT THIS DISTRICT AND MANY OF THESE CONVERSATIONS ARE NOT IN THESE AREAS.  FLUSH. AND SO IT'S A LOT OF LOST HOUSING THAT ISN'T NEXT TO A BUS GARAGE. I'LL JUST KIND OF SAY IT THERE. THERE IS MORE OPPORTUNITY. IF WE'RE GOING TO LEAVE HOUSING OPPORTUNITY ON THE TABLE I THINK IT'S UNFORTUNATE AND I THINK WE CAN DO A LOT MORE TONIGHT.
02:12:01.154: >> COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL.
02:12:06.459: >> I'M NOT SURE HOW I FEEL ABOUT ALL THIS.  SOMEBODY SAY SOMETHING LIKE YEAH, AND THEN SOMEBODY ELSE SAYS SOMETHING AND I'M LIKE YEAH. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK IS IN THE FAVOR OF MR. LEONARD IS SAYING ENTHUSIASTICALLY SAYING THESE ARE THE AREAS WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO PROMOTE, WHAT ARE THE THINGS I REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE IN HERE IS THAT IF WE'RE THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS, IT SEEMS, IS TO HAVE PEOPLE BE ABLE TO TAKE THE BUS AND BE ABLE TO GET AROUND WITH ALTERNATIVE, NOT ALTERNATIVE, BY WALKING, BY BIKING, SCOOTERRING, WHAT TOUGHER IS. IF WE HAVE THESE AREAS THAT WE'RE FOCUSING ON THE CITY CAN DO A LOT TO TRY TO ENHANCE THESE JONES. — SOME OF THESE ZONES.  SOME OF THOSE STATE AREAS ARE HORRIBLE RIGHT NOW FOR BIKING AND WALKING AND IF WE HAVE SOME OF THESE ZONES IT CAN BE A COORDINATED EFFORT TO MAKE IT BECAUSE WHATEVER YOU'RE GOING TO IS 15 MINUTES AWAY YOU'RE NOT GOING TO WAIT FOR THE BUS FOR 30 MINUTES. AND SAY YOU WANT TO MAKE IT AND THE TRAFFIC NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO BIKE OR WALK, OR WHATEVER IT IS, AND IT SEEMS IF THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT AREAS SCATTERED AROUND TOWN WE LOSE THE ABILITY TO FOCUS AND MAKE THESE AREAS REALLY FRIENDLY TO THESE OTHER MODES OF TRANSPORTATION, SO IT'S NOT JUST TRANSIT, BUT IT'S THESE OTHER WAYS OF GETTING AROUND. I MISSED LAST TIME SO I'M NOT AS UP ON THIS AS ALL OF YOU ARE. I WANT TO REALLY MAKE SURE THAT THE AREAS WE ARE PROMOTING WITH THIS, THAT WE REALLY NEED TO SUPPORT IT WITH THESE OTHER MODES OF TRANSPORTATION TOO BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO DRIVE THIS, I MEAN, RIGHT NOW, I'M SURE MR. CARPENTER DOESN'T HAVE ANY PLANS TO HAVE THE BUS RUN EVERY 10 MINUTES. SO WE NEED TO MAKE IT EASY FOR PEOPLE TO CHOOSE THESE METHODS OTHERWISE WE'RE JUST CLOGGING UP WASHTENAW MORE JUST LIKE THE CALLERS HAVE SAID. ID WITH REALLY, BY, HAVING THESE AREAS, WE CAN KIND OF FOCUS AND SOME OF THESE AREAS HAVE A DECENT SYSTEM SET UP AND THE SOME OF THESE DON'T. REGARDLESS OF THE DIRECTION WE GO AROUND THIS PHILOSOPHICAL STATEMENT TO MAKE SURE WE ARE REALLY THINKING CAREFULLY ABOUT HAVING THIS OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE BE ROBUST AS WELL BESIDES JUST THE BUS ROUTE PIECE OF IT. THE OTHER THING I WANT TO SAY MOVING BACK TO SOMETHING COMMISSIONER DISCH SAID TOTALLY UNRELATED IS THE BARGAIN BASEMENT SITES LIKE SOUTH INDUSTRIAL, YOU KNOW, YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO CHARGE THE RENTS THAT YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THE CONSTRUCTION HAPPEN.  FLUSH. IN A PLACE LIKE THAT. SO IT'S NOT NECESSARILY GOING TO BE THE FIRST PLACE BECAUSE IT HAS TO BE A RELATIVELY, YOU KNOW, ATTRACTIVE PLACE TO BE OR CONVENIENT OR WHATEVER IT IS, YOU KNOW, THAT MAKES IT SO IT'S NOT A LIKE AN AUTOMATIC RELATION RELATIONSHIP, I THINK, BY INCLUDING SOUTH INDUSTRIAL, THOSE ARE ALL GOING TO GO FIRST AND WE'RE LOSING OUT ON SOME OF THESE OTHER AREAS BECAUSE IT'S GOT TO BE ATTRACTIVE ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO BE, I MEAN, THE COST OF BUILDING IS NOT GOING TO BE ANY DIFFERENT ON SOUTH INDUSTRIAL THAN IT IS ON WASHTENAW. THE LAND IS DIFFERENT, BUT YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO CHARGE RENTS THAT ARE HIGH ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO MAKE IT ALL WORK. I WOULD IMAGINE THAT SOUTH INDUSTRIAL IS PROBABLY A STRETCH AND THERE'S A REASON OUR HOUSING COMMISSION IS THE ONE LOOKING AT THAT CORRIDOR BECAUSE IT IS A STRETCH.  IT DOES FEEL, IT DOESN'T FEEL AS NICE TO WALK ALLOCK THERE. TO WALK ALONG THERE.
02:15:45.711: >> COMMISSIONER SAUVE, I'M WONDERING IF AS A NOT A COMPROMISE, BUT LIKE COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL, I'M TRYING TO WEIGH WHAT WOULD WORK. IN MY MIND THOSE FIRST FOUR CORRIDORS THAT ARE LISTED ON THERE THAT THERE'S SUPPORT FROM THE MASTER PLAN THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT WE SHOULD ACTIVELY MOVE ON, PROACTIVELY REZONE. IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN OVERNIGHT; RIGHT? WE KNOW THAT'S GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME AND IF OTHER DEVELOPMENT PROPOSALS COME IN IN CORRIDORS BEYOND THOSE, GREAT; RIGHT? FOR US. I COULD SEE CUTTING SECTION 3. THE THING THAT I FEEL LIKE GETS LOST BECAUSE I'M NOT A HUNDRED PERCENT SOLD YET ON THIS THAT WE SHOULD, THAT ALL OF THE INDUSTRIAL DISTRICTS SHOULD BE, THE GATES SHOULD BE OPENED ON THAT IS THE COMMERCIALLY AND OFFICE ZONE STRETCHES BUT THAT LANGUAGE IS ALSO IN THE GENERAL INTENT STATEMENT SO AS LONG AS WE KEEP THAT UP THERE, I WOULD BE OKAY HONESTLY WITH CUTTING THREE. BECAUSE I THINK IT'S TALKING ABOUT THE CORRIDORS THAT WE ALL HAVE DISCUSSED, WE ALL BELIEVE, WE OUGHT TO MOVE PROACTIVELY TO REZONE. I THINK WE ALL AGREED WITH THAT. I THINK THE REST OF THAT STATEMENT, WHICH OTHER THAN THE WORD CAREFUL APPLICATION IN MY MIND DOES NOT IT SAYS EFFECTIVELY WHAT THE GENERAL INTENT SAYS I FEEL LIKE MAYBE THAT DOESN'T, I WONDER IF THAT ADDRESSES YOUR CONCERN OVER SENDING THE MESSAGE THAT YOU'VE GOT A BIG BAR TO JUMP OVER.
02:17:36.088: >> I THINK THAT'S IT. THREE IS THE THING THAT SENDS A DIFFERENT MESSAGE AND THREE CAN BE COMMISSION PROPOSE BUSINESS OF A PROACTIVE ZONE BUT IF WE INCLUDE IT IN THE LANGUAGE, I THINK IT TIGHTENS IT DOWN TOO MUCH. SO THREE IS THE THINGHAT IN REALLY RESTRICVE T OPPORTITY. I THK A LOT OF, LIKE, ONE AND TWO FURTHER ARTICULATE THOSE CHECK BOXES, RIGHT? TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE LEAVING A LOT OF THOSE THINGS.  I DON'T HAVE AN ISSUE WITH THAT.  IT REALLY IS HOW NARROW THE PINK LINES ARE PROPOSED ARE. THAT CONCERNS ME IN, YOU KNOW, HOW IT'S PRESENTED TO US FOR REZONING, HOW PUBLIC COMMENT REVIEWS AND UNDERSTANDS AND INTERPRETS IT BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO, YOU KNOW, ADJACENT NEIGHBORS READING THIS AND SAYING YOU'RE OUTSIDE OF THAT PINK LINE. YOU CAN'T DO THIS. IT'S NOT - - IT'S THE SAME OF WHY PARKING ISN'T IN THERE, AND IT'S SAFER TO PUT IT IN, WELL IT'S INTERPRETED TO BE. WE SHOULD MAKE IT AS CLEAR AS POSSIBLE. FOR WHAT THE INTENT IS. I THINK THE MAIN INTENT IS IN A, IN WANTING TO. SO.
02:19:00.239: >> HOW I WOULD SUMMARIZE THEN THE EDITS TO THE PURPOSE STATEMENTS IS IN B1 STRIKING ONLY AND ADDING NP AS A LISTED DISTRICT IN R5. IN TWO, STRIKING ONLY, MR. LEONARD YOU DID IT. GREAT. SHOULD BE LOCATED PROXIMATE TO A TRANSIT CORRIDOR. YEP. AND THEN... YEP. AND NUMBER ONE I THINK BASED ON WHAT WE WERE JUST SAYING R5 SHOULD BE ADDED IN AFTER P. AND THEN STRIKING THREE ENTIRELY. KNOWING THOSE ARE THE PLACES THAT IT IS CURRENTLY A FLOATING ZONE. THAT'S OUR CHECK LIST OF THE PLACES WE WANT TO WORK ON.
02:20:13.612: >> SO LET LET ME KNOW IF THIS IS SOMETHING YOU'RE COMFORTABLE DOING IN THIS NARRATIVE. ONE THING I WOULD WILL ASK THE PLANNING COMMISSION TO THINK ABOUT IS AS PART OF THE DIRECTION FROM THE CITY COUNCIL IS TO RECOMMEND THE ZONING DISTRICT AND THE PLACES WHERE YOU THINK THIS WOULD BE APPROPRIATE. THE DISTRICT AS DRAFTED DOES BOTH THOSE THINGS. SO BY STRIKING THIS, I WOULD ASK THE PLANNING COMMISSION TO FIND ANOTHER WAY TO COMMUTING THAT. IT SAYS PLANNING COMMISSION BELIEVES THIS IS THE FIRST PLACE, THESE ARE THE PLACES THAT ARE APPROPRIATE, YOU STILL HAVE TO WRESTLE WITH THIS DECISION WHETHER OR NOT TO INCLUDE IF THOSE ARE THE RIGHT FOUR OR FIVE OR SEVEN OR THREE BUT I WANT TO FRAME THAT PART OF YOUR DIRECTION IS NOW INTEGRATE THIS DISTRICT AND WHERE IT SHOULD BE LOCATED.  THUS FAR, YOU HAVE ACCOMPLISHED BOTH OF THOSE BY STRIKING NUMBER THREE, I THINK YOU'RE ONLY ACCOMPLISHING ONE OF THOSE ASKS I WANT TO BE CLEAR YOU CAN DO THAT IN OTHER MANNERS.
02:21:25.050: >> THAT COB IN THE COULD BE IN THE MEMO THAT GOES TO THEM. IF WE WANTED TO, AND IF WE TOOK THE TIME TO DUKE OUT EXACTLY WHAT THE EXTENT WAS, WHICH I THINK THAT IS A CONTINUED DISCUSSION, THAT PARAGRAPH COULD BE THE HEART OF AND YOUR SECOND PART THE DISTRICT THE SECOND PART ABOUT WHERE IT'S APPROPRIATE.
02:21:45.904: >> YEP.
02:21:46.338: >> OKAY. I WOULD BE MORE COMFORTABLE WITH THAT AND ACTUALLY I THINK THAT THAT. I THINK THE COMMISSIONER SAUVE'S, I CAN SEE MR. LEONARD HOW YOU WERE SAYING IF YOU'RE HERE, COME TO US BUT ACTUALLY IF YOU'RE IN ONE OF THE FOUR DEFINITELY WHEN COME TO US BUT HOPEFULLY WE'RE GOING TO GET GET TO YOU SOON PROACTIVELY. AND ANYBODY ELSE PLEASE GIVE US YOUR BEST PROPOSAL TO ADVANCE THE GOALS THAT ARE IN OUR MASTER, MANY ELEMENTS OF OUR MASTER PLAN. COMMISSIONER ABRONS.
02:22:27.713: >> I WANTED TO MAYBE JUST OFFER UP A COUPLE OF OTHER MAYBE EASY AMENDMENTS. WELL, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT EASY, BUT STRAIGHTFORWARD IF OTHER PEOPLE ARE - - SO ONE WOULD BE ALEXIS YOU MENTION 5163L WHICH IS THE PARKING WHAT WOULD YOU CALL IT.
02:22:55.107: >> YEP.
02:22:55.674: >> RESTRICTION.  I THINK THAT MAKES SENSE TO ADOPT.  YOU HAVE TO HAVE ANOTHER USE IN BETWEEN THE RIGHT OF WAY AND THE PARKING. I'D BE IN FAVOR OF THAT.
02:23:06.285: >> ALEXIS, WOULD WE ACCOMPLISH THAT IF WE JUST ADDED A PARKING LOT OR STRUCTURE AS A PERMITTED USE? TO THE TABLE? BECAUSE AND THE USE TABLE ALL PARKING LOTS AND STRUCTURES REFERENCE 5.16.3. BUT THAT'S A WAY TO ESTABLISH IT THEN AS AS A PRIMARY USE AS OPPOSED TO JUST ACCESSORY TO ANOTHER USE.  I GUESS THAT'S THE DISTINCTION.
02:23:33.812: >> RIGHT, IN THE CURRENT TABLE PARKING.... THOSE USE SPECIFIC STANDARDS CALL OUT D1 AND D2 IN MULTIPLE PLACES.
02:23:46.592: >> YEAH.
02:23:46.859: >> SO EITHER OR.  EITHER D1 AND D2 NEEDS TO BE PULL PULLED OUT, OR TC1 NEEDS TO BE ADDED IN.
02:23:56.034: >> YEAH. WE GET WHAT WE'RE HEARING IS MAKE THAT CONNECTION SO THOSE RESTRICTIONS APPLY. I DON'T KNOW, I CAN'T, I DON'T KNOW THE RIGHT PLACE FOR IT RIGHT NOW IN THE DRAFT, BUT I AM CLEAR IF THE PLANNING COMMISSION IS CLEAR, WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT THAT IS INCORPORATED APPROPRIATELY GOING FORWARD. IT'S JUST REFERENCING LIKE YOU SAID AN EXISTING SECTION.
02:24:16.622: >> YEAH. AND THEN THE OTHER ONE WAS REMOVING THE THREE STORY REQUIREMENTS FOR LARGE LOT TOWN HOMES OR APARTMENT BUILDINGS. IS A CHANGE THAT I WOULD BE IN FAVOR OF.
02:24:33.272: >> SO NO MINIMUM STORIES?
02:24:35.307: >> NO, NO, TWO. THE SMALLER LOT HAS A TWO STORY MINIMUM BUT THE BIGGER ONES HAVE A THREE STORY, SO REDUCING IT JUST HAVING IT BE TWO ACROSS ALL LOT SIZES. AND THEN A VERY SMALL THING, BUT I NOTICED IN THE USE TABLE THAT GROUP DAYCARE HOMES ARE NOT, THEY'RE ALLOWED IN THE OTHER MIXED USE DISTRICTS THAT WOULD BE REZONED BUT THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED IN TC1.  I'M WONDERING IF IF THERE'S SOME RATIONALE BEHIND THAT.
02:25:07.506: >> SINGLE FAMILY HOMES ARE NOT PERMITTED IN THE TC1 DISTRICT. ATTACHED TOWNHOUSES ARE PERMITTED.  I FELT THAT THE SPACE REQUIREMENTS AND THE COMPATIBLE FOR THE GROUP OF HOMES WHICH ARE SOME SEVEN TO 12 CHILDREN ARE NOT THE BEST FIT WITH THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE TC1.  I FELT THAT THE FAMILY DAYCARES WHICH ARE ONE TO SIX CHILDREN CAN STILL BE ACCOMPLISHED WITH EVERYONE'S HAPPINESS, BOTH THE CHILDRENS AND THE OPERATORS, BUT ALSO THE SURROUNDING, BUT I THOUGHT THAT, UM, UP TO 12 CHILDREN WITHOUT THE SINGLE FAMILY HOME ASPECT WAS NOT THE BEST FIT. LET ME KNOW YOUR IS THAT EARN NO, NO THAT MAKES SENSE.  IT'S A MIDDLE SCALE.  YOU'RE SAYING.
02:26:10.268: >> RIGHT.
02:26:10.569: >> SMALL ENOUGH TO BE, YEAH, I GOT IT. I WANT TO GIVE A HEIGHT LIMIT AND GIVE THE FLOOR IF OTHER PEOPLE HAD AMEND.S THEY WANTED TO SUGGEST.
02:26:36.094: >> I'M NUT SEEING OTHER HANDS SO WHY DON'T YOU KEEP GOING WITH IT HUNCH I JUST WONDERED IF IT SEEMS I KNOW THE 55-FOOT LIMIT IS MORE COMPARABLE TO THE CURRENT ZONING BUT IT'S WHEN YOU SHOWED US THE DRAWING IT FELT TALL.  AND I WONDERED IF, AND THIS IS MAYBE GOING BACK TO KIND OF LIKE MAYBE TRYING TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT THE ORDINANCE BEING THE THING WHICH LIMITS DEVELOPMENT WE DON'T WANT AS OPPOSED TO LIMITING IT BY GEOGRAPHIC REGION. I'M SURE SOME OF THESE OTHER CORRIDORS WE THINK ABOUT LIKE PACKARD AND ARE FAR MORE LOW RISE AND HAVE GREATER DENSITY I WOULD BE IN FAVOR OF THINKING ABOUT LOWERING THAT BUT I ALSO WOULD BE IN FAVOR OF REMOVING THE 120-FOOT. LETTING THE PROXIMITY TO RESIDENTIAL, YOU KNOW, BE THE THING THAT LIMITS THAT HEIGHT AS OPPOSED TO THE ARTIFICIAL CAP NO MATTER HOW FAR IT IS SO IF RIGHT NOW IT'S 55 AND 120 I THINK I WOULD BE IN FAVOR OF OPENING IT UP AT EITHER END IF THAT WAS SOMETHING OTHER PEOPLE WERE INTERESTED IN THINKING ABOUT. FLUSH. AND THAT'S MY LAST COMMENT FOR NOW.
02:28:01.313: >> I GUESS MY IMMEDIATE REACTION TO THAT IS THAT THAT ACTUALLY AS I WAS KNOW GOING THROUGH, AND THINKING ABOUT OVERALL HOW DO I FEEL ABOUT THIS, I THINK. THE IDEA OF SOME HEIGHT RELAXATION, RIGHT, LIKE ALEXIS NOTED SOME PLACES WHERE SOMETHING IS A LITTLE BIT HIGHER MIGHT BE ALLOWED. THE NO FAR LIMIT, AND THE PARKING MINIMUMS.  THOSE REMOVING THOSE.  LIKE, THOSE ARE THE IN MY MIND, THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT WE'RE LOOSENING TO TRY TO GET, TO SPUR THE DEVELOPMENT THAT IS ALLOWED RIGHTS NOW. WE i ALLOW MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT ON MOST OF THESE PROPERTIES THAT WE'RE NOT GETTING. I KIND OF FEEL LIKE IT MAKES SENSE TO GO WITH WHAT WE HAVE, LIKE, TO TRY IT. I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS OF US BEING PREACTIVE ON THE CORRIDORS WHERE WE KNOW IT'S GOING TO WORK AND SEE WHAT PROPOSALS WE GET FOR THE CORRIDORS WHERE WE HAVEN'T ARTICULATED ALL OF IT SEE WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE ON PACKARD, THERE'S DISCRETION.  THEY HAVE TO MAKE THE CASE THAT THIS MAKES SENSE TO REZONE. I WOULD BE MORE COMFORTABLE WITH WE KNOW THAT IT WORKS IN THE PLACES IN THE FOUR CORRIDORS WE TALKED ABOUT. I'M WORRIED THAT IF WE REDUCE IT MORE AND MAYBE IT'S JUST ON THOSE KIND OF EDGE PROPERTIES TO TO YOUR POINT IN TERMS OF THE DISTANCE, BUT EVEN IF IT IS JUST ON THOSE EDGE PROPERTIES WE'RE NOT GETTING. WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR RIGHT NOW AND WHAT WE HEARD WAS IT MIGHT NOT BE THE PARKING NECESSARILY. WE MIGHT STILL WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S PARKING. FOR HOUSING PEOPLE MAY WANT TO BE PROVIDING PARKING.  I THINK THAT IF WE WANT TO TRY TO GET MORE HOUSING IT'S PROBABLY A COMBINATION OF HEIGHT AND FAR. THAT'S WHY I WOULD FEEL COMFORTABLE LEAVE CITY PLANNING COMMISSION AT THIS. COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL. YOU HIT IT TOO MANY TIMES.
02:30:35.467: >> I THINK, YEAH.
02:30:40.038: >> I TALKED TO A DEVELOPER ABOUT THIS AND HE THINKS THERE'S NO WN.  THEOST O CONSTCTN, OFLLY EE CMISSNER SAE NDING HER HEA THE COST OF CONSTRUCTION TO SUPPORT A BUILDING THAT TALL, YOU CANNOT CHARGE THE RENT THAT YOU NEED TO CHARGE FOR LIVING IN THAT PART OF TOWN. SO US SAYING YOU CAN GO, IT'S JUST VERY LIKELY NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. IT'S LAKELY GOING TO HAPPEN ARE THINGS THAT ARE UNDER THE STICK BELT RANGE SO FOUR OR FIVE STORIES AND LESS IS WHAT IS VERY LIKELY GOING TO HAPPEN. WE MAY BE HAVING THESE DISCUSSION ABOUT THINGS THAT MAYBE 50 YEARS FROM NOW WHEN ANN ARBOR IS REALLY BUFFERING OUT, BUT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A DIFFERENT SET OF ORDINANCES AT THAT POINT TOO. THE ONLY PLACE THAT FISCALLY MAKES SENSE TO DO TALL BUILDINGS IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO CHARGE RENT IS DOWNTOWN. I'M NOT A DEVELOPER SO SOME OF THESE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE KIND OF SKY'S THE LIMIT MAY NOT BE HAPPENING SO I'M IN FAVOR OF LEAVING IT THE WAY IT IS BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S GOING TO MAKE MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF WHAT WE GET.
02:31:56.548: >> AS WE HAVE PROJECTS IN THE CORE OF THE CITY THAT WHERE, THAT WE'RE HEARING THAT WE ARE PROBABLY GOING TO PAW OR NOT MOVE FORWARD BECAUSE OF THOSE SAME ISSUES.  THE PROJECTS EVEN IN THE DOWNTOWN RIGHT NOW ARE NOT VIABLE OR ARE GOING TO BE CHALLENGING. I DO THINK THAT THE DISTRICT AS PRESENTED IS A BALANCE, IT IS MAKING A LAND USE DECISION. THE MARKET NOW I AGREE IS CHALLENGING. THAT PROBABLY HAS SOME IMPLICATIONS ON THE SHORT-TERM REALIZATION OF WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE BUT WE SHOULD BE REALLY LOOKING AT WHAT THE LONG-TERM POTENTIAL IS. I THINK THIS IS ACCOMMODATING OF SOME MOVEMENT IN THAT MARKET GOING FORWARD.
02:32:55.373: >> I CAN JUMP IN. JUST LIKE THE HEIGHT LIMIT IN MOST OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS 55 FEET NOW. AND WE CAN PROBABLY COUNT UNWOUND HA NUMBER OF BUILDINGS WE CAN IDENTIFY THAT APPROACH THAT HEIGHT LIMIT. WARN ANDST - IN THE REALITY WE'RE PROBABLY NOT GOING TO SEE MUCH IN THAT RANGE, BUT I THINK THAT WE HAVE TAKEN A MEANINGFUL STEP BY BEYOND A THRESHOLD, A RANGE OF 80 FEET, WE'RE GOING TO ALLOW THE 75-FOOT BUILDING AWHICH WILL FULLY REALIZE THOSE STICK-BUILT CONSTRUCTIONS WHICH IS VIABLE, AND IS DIFFICULT TO DO AT 55 FEET BUT CAN BE DONE AT 75 FEET. SO, ECHOING BRETT AND BUILDING UPON IT, I THINK THAT WE HAVE PRESENTED SOMETHING THAT IS VIABLE AND IS A COMPROMISE AND I DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING TO BE THE DOOR IS GOING TO BE BEATEN DOWN WITH 120-FOOT BUILDINGS. IT'S OUT THERE JUST LIKE 55-FEET IS OUT THERE NOW. BUT IT'S NOT QUITE ENOUGH TO FULLY REALIZE THE - - THE STICK-BUILT. WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF ONE-STORY. BY GIVING THIS, INCREASING THE RANGE TO 75, I THINK WE MIGHT GET MORE OF THE BUILDINGS LIKE WE SAW, LIKE THE YARD AND 618, WE CAN SEE THOSE IN THESE PROJECTS HERE.
02:34:28.366: >> RIGHT.
02:34:28.900: >> I'M HEARING A CONVINCING ARGUMENT FOR KEEPING THE 55 BUT I'M NOT BEING CONVINCED ABOUT KEEPING THE 120. WHAT IS THAT CAPPING?  WE'RE MOVING FROM A NO HEIGHT LIMIT IN SOME OF THESE TO A 120.
02:34:45.583: >> IT'S ABOUT HALF I THINK.  FOR THE OFFICE DISTRICT WE'RE GOING FROM UNLIMITED TO 120. IN THE COMMERCIAL DISTRICT WE'RE GOING FROM 55 TO A MIDDLE 75, AND THEN AN ULTIMATE 120.
02:34:58.696: >> RIGHT.
02:35:00.899: >> SO IN THE BROAD BRUSH STADIUM AREA, AND WASHTENAW AREA WE'RE GOING FROM 55 POTENTIALLY TO 120 IF THERE AND MOSTLY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE NORTH SIDE.
02:35:14.579: >> YEAH.
02:35:14.946: >> STADIUM AS WELL. STADIUM WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 55, MAYBE THE 120 TO 120. AND THE STATE AND EISENHOWER AREA WHERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT UNLIMIT TO 120 AND IN PLYMOUTH IT'S MORE OF A 50/50.  IT'S HALF, IT'S HALF OFFICE, OR RESEARCH THERE AND HALF D3. SO IT'S A WASH.
02:35:41.706: >> I SEE.  SO IT'S FINDING THE COMMON DENOMINATOR SO THAT IT'S TALL ENOUGH TO NOT SEVERELY LIMIT UNLIMITED BUT ISN'T SO TALL THAT IT'S OUTSIZED IN THESE DISTRICTS WHERE IT FORMALERLY HAD A 55-FOOT LIMIT.
02:36:00.291: >> RIGHT.
02:36:00.825: >> OKAY, THAT HELPS, THANKS.
02:36:05.530: >> IN TERMS OF POTENTIAL AMENDMENTS I HAVE TWO MORE THINGS I'M GOING TO ASK ABOUT. THE HUB AND ALSO FOR PROPERTIES YOU SHOWED ON SOUTH MAIN, DO THEY i HAVE A 15-FOOT FIRST FLOOR HEIGHT?
02:36:20.211: >> THE HUB DOES.  I'LL HAVE TO LOOK UP THE SITE. THE DIFFERENCE MIGHT BE THE PROPERTIES ON SOUTH STATE. THEY'RE ZONE D2 AND THEY ARE A I BELIEVE A SECONDARY STREET NAME A NOT A PRIMARY STREET.
02:36:42.634: >> OKAY, GOT IT. WHERE I WAS THINKING ABOUT THIS WAS THE IDEA OF ACTIVE USE ON A CORNER AND AND IT'S SORT OF RELATED. SO RIGHT NOW THE KIND OF DISTINCTION, THE TWO KIND OF OPTIONS ARE A MIXED USE BUILDING WHERE YOU HAVE THIS LIKE FIRST FLOOR HEIGHT LIMIT, LIKE YOU HAVE TO BE AT LEAST 15 FEET, AND YOU'VE GOT THE TRANSPARENCY REQUIREMENTS, AND THEN YOU HAVE THE OR TOWN HOUSES IF SOMEBODY WANTED TO BUILD AN APARTMENT BUILDING, WHICH ONE WOULD THEY FALL UNDER? IT'S NOT MIXED USE.
02:37:27.478: >> IT WOULD BE AN APARTMENT. THE DESCRIPTION IS TOWN HOUSE SLASH APARTMENT, BUILDING FULLY RESIDENTIAL WITH NO MIXED USE COMPONENTS TO IT.
02:37:34.919: >> SO BECAUSE WE MAKE THAT DISTINCTION IF WE WANTED TO SAY WITH -B 100 FEET OF AN EXISTING INTERSECTION MAYBE BECAUSE THEY'RE WITHIN A HUNDRED FEET OF AN INTERSECTION YOU'VE GOT TO DO A MIXED USE BUILDING. WE'VE ALREADY IDENTIFIED THAT. WOULD THAT SOLVE, WOULD THAT... I'M WONDERING IF THAT'S THE WAY TO DO IT RATHER THAN THIS WHOLE ACTIVE USE ON THE CORNER. SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO DEFINE ACTIVE USE, INSTEAD WE CAN SAY MIXED USE BUILDING. WOULD THAT SOLVE THAT ISSUE OR ADDRESS THAT ISSUE? THAT WAS BROUGHT UP?
02:38:21.299: >> I WOULD TURN IT BACK TO YOU. IT'S DEFINITELY ONE APPROACH. AND IF THE COMMISSION FINDS IT TO BE IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR MIXED USE IS ON THE CORNER THEN YES, ABSOLUTELY. IT'S MORE OF A QUESTION OF NOT SO MUCH ME, BUT WHAT DO YOU FIND IMPORTANT.
02:38:40.952: >> GOT IT.
02:38:43.221: >> LIKE, WHERE I WELCOME OTHER PEOPLES THOUGHTS.  COMMISSIONER SAUVE.
02:38:49.727: >> I GO RIGHT INTO INTERPRETATION, IF IT'S A HUNDRED FEET AND LIKE A 200-FOOT LOT WOULD YOU ONLY NEED TO DO MIXED USE ON THAT FIRST 100 FEET AND THEN DROP THAT APARTMENT ALL THE WAY DOWN. SIMILAR TO THAT PACKARD, IT HAD SOMETHING ON THE CORNER AND THEN THERE WAS STUFF. I GUESS FOR STAFF HOW WOULD YOU INTERPRET IT BASED ON HOW IT'S PROPOSED? IF IT WAS, IF WE SAID MIXED USE WITHIN A HUNDRED FEET OF A CORNER, WOULD IT BE I GUESS WE COULD WRITE IT EITHER WAY, OR WOULD THERE BE INTERPRETATION SAYING FOR CLARITY OF THE LOT, AND ITS USE? DO YOU KNOWED WHAT I'M ASKING?
02:39:38.075: >> I DO. IT CAN BE WRITTEN IN ANY MULTITUDE OF WAYS. YOU NEED DECIDE WHAT IS IMPORTANT AND WHAT SHOULD BE THE REGULATION AND THEN IT CAN BE WRITTEN TO GET THAT.
02:39:54.492: >> FROM MY PERSPECTIVE ONE OF THE EXAMPLES YOU SHOWED I THINK IS ON THE CONDO ON THE CORNER OF LIBERTY AND MAPLE MAYBE WHERE IT SNEAKS DOWN BY KROGER, THAT'S NOT AN EXCITING CORNER TO WALK AROUND.  BECAUSE THE TOWN HOUSE BEING UP ON THE HILL IS NOT. THESE ARE BIG BLOCKS IN MOST OF THESE PLACES RIGHT NOW SO THERE'S NOT VERY MANY CORNERS. IN MY MIND AS A WAY TO ENSURE THERE CONTINUES TO BE SOME KIND OF COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY, HAVING THEM ON THE CORNER, I THINK MAKES A LOT OF SENSE. I THINK A HUNDRED FEET, AND I WOULD BE TOTALLY COOL WITH HAVING CAFE AND WHATEVER, I DON'T KNOW HOW BIG HOW MUCH FRONTAGE YOU NEED FOR WHATEVER. FLUSH. THAT'S LISA'S AREA, BUT LIKE CONTINUING IT INTO RESIDENTIAL AWESOME.  LIKE, THAT'S IDEAL. SO LIKE I DON'T KNOW IF IT HAS TO BE A HUNDRED OR IF IT CAN BE 50 OR I DON'T, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE RIGHT NUMBER IS, BUT I LIKE THAT IDEA. AND BECAUSE THERE ARE, BECAUSE THESE EXISTING CORRIDORS ARE SO LONG, THE BLOCKS ARE SO LONG, IT ACTUALLY IS NOT REQUIRING MIXED USE ON ALL THAT MANY PROPERTIES.
02:41:28.486: >> LIKE DOWNTOWN BETWEEN 20 AND 50 FEET WIDE BUILDINGS, THAT'S YOUR STORE FRONT. SO LIKE IT'S DOWNTOWN AND REALLY DENSE SO A HUNDRED FEET REALLY COVERS MAYBE A COUPLE OF TENANT SUITES. I LIKE THIS, ALSO BECAUSE IT TRIES TO RECALIBRATE WHAT'S ON THE TRANSCORRIDOR VERSUS AROUND THE TRANSIT CORRIDOR. I THINK THIS IS GOING TO GO DEEPER. WHAT A TC2 MIGHT BE IS SOMETHING THAT'S DOWN IN SCALE BUT HIGHER DENSITY RESIDENTIAL MAYBE BEHIND THIS.  SO WHAT WOULD BE A BUMMER IS IF WE LOADED UP APARTMENT BUILDINGS AND TOWN HOUSES ON THESE CORRIDORS AND LOST COMMERCIAL. THIS GIVES A LITTLE BIT OF CALIBRATION WITHOUT OVERBURDENING ANY LOT ON THE CORNER SO THAT THEY COULD TOUCH DOWN AND PUT MORE UNITS IN. I LIKE THAT BALANCE IF IT CAN BE WRITTEN THAT WAY.
02:42:28.045: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT: JUST TO CLARIFY R WE PROPOSING YOU HAVE A 200-FOOT LOT JUST THE FIRST 100 FEET, AND THEN THE NEXT 100 FEET COULD JUST BE RESIDENTIAL?
02:42:37.455: >> YEAH, I THINK THIS IS I THINK, I LOVE THE IDEA OF MICKED USED MIXED USE ON THE CORNER TO ACTIVATE THE CORNERS FOR ALL THE POINTS JUST SAID AND I THINK THAT THIS SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD PROPOSAL.
02:42:56.107: >> COMMISSIONER ABRONS.
02:42:57.508: >> MIXED USE OR ACTIVE USE?  ARE WE JUST SAYING YOU HAVE TO HAVE A COMMERCIAL SPACE ON THE CORNER? IT CAN BE A BANKR A WHATEVER...
02:43:08.419: >> BANK BUT NO DRIVE THRU. BECAUSE THAT'S NOT ALLOWED IN THIS DISTRICT.
02:43:13.357: >> COULD CABRINI IT BE SELF STORAGE?
02:43:15.192: >> ALSO I THINK THAT'S NOT ON THE TABLE, RIGHT?
02:43:18.696: >> I KNOW.  TOO SOON IN.
02:43:21.499: >> AND NO DRIVE THRU COFFEE.
02:43:25.736: >> YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WALK.
02:43:28.773: >> FOR US UNDERSTANDING THIS, DO YOU ENVISION SO THAT 200-FOOT WIDE LOT EXAMPLE ON THEORNER OF WASHTENAW AND HERRO PARKWAY, WOULD IT APPLY TO E FIT 0 FEET FM T CNE BOTH DIRECTIO OR JUST ALONG THE TRANSIT CORRIDOR?
02:43:54.899: >> I THINK ALONG THE TRANSIT CORRIDOR. I WOULD BE OKAY WITH LIMITING IT TO THAT.
02:44:00.104: >> AND IF CREATE SORT OF OUR IDEALIZED BLOCK ARRANGEMENT, WE DON'T REPLICATE IT ON THE SORT OF INTERIOR SUIT CORNER. IT'S RIGHT - - SITE CORNER IT'S RIGHT OF WAY. IF MEASURING SUCCESS, - - FOR MEASURING SUCCESS, IS THAT A MINIMUM PERCENTAGE OF MIXED USE, IS THAT A MINIMUM SQUARE FOOTAGE THAT IS PROVIDED AT THE CORNER. IF IT IS, DOES IT HAVE TO BE A MINIMUM OF 10,000 SQUARE FEET AT WITHIN THAT HUNDRED FEET, AND THAT IS THE SAME WHETHER YOU ARE DOING A THREE-STORY OR TEN-STORY BUILDING. OR IS IT PROPORTIONAL TO I'M JUST TRYING TO ASK QUESTIONS TO HELP US UNDERSTAND HOW THAT MIGHT BE DRAFTED.
02:44:50.521: >> GO AHEAD.
02:44:51.489: >> I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE PRESCRIPTIVE ABOUT IT. I THINK YOU KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO FIGURE OUT HOW BIG SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE AND WE SHOULD GO WITH THAT. I THINK IT'S GETTING TOO HEAVY HANDED FOR US TO SAY THE PERCENTAGE OF HOW BIG IT NEEDS TO BE. I THINK THEY NEED TO SAY WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO ATTRACT X BUSINESS ACCORDING TO WHATEVER IS GOING ON IN THOSE CORRIDORS AND IT'S NUT GOING TO BE A CLOSET. IT'S GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT THEY WANT TO BE VIABLE. SO I THINK Y SHOULD GIVE THEM FREEDOM TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. THAT'S MY SENSE.  IT GIVES THEM SOME FLEXIBILITY.
02:45:22.786: >> I THINK ABOUT THAT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE PATHWAY PROJECT RECENTLY APPROVED. THE COMMERCIAL SPACE ON THAT IS VERY SMALL. SO TO COMMISSIONER IS A'S POINT, I THINK TO COMMISSIONER IS A'S POINT, I THINK TO SOME EXTENT THAT PROJECT HAS DONE THAT. THE FRONTAGE HAS BEEN PROGRAMMED FOR RESIDENTIAL BECAUSE THAT DISCRETION WAS LEFT. IS THAT OKAY ON STATE AND PLYMOUTH AND STADIUM?
02:45:49.446: >> WHAT I LIKE IS THAT IT BUILDS IT INTO THE 15 FEET TALL WHICH THE REASON FOR LIKE IT HAS TO BE A MIXED USE BUILDING SO THEY HAVE TO HAVE THAT MINIMUM FLOOR AREA WHICH WE DID THAT SO IT'S FLEXIBLE. IT CAN BE DIFFERENT THINGS TO ADAPT IN THE FUTURE.
02:46:08.966: >> DO WE CARE LES ABOUT THAT HEIGHT FOR THE NEXT BUILDING THEN? OKAY.
02:46:15.472: >> THAT WAS THE IDEA OF, LIKE, AFTER THAT 100 FEET, IF YOU WANT TO TURN IT INTO TOWN HOMES GO FOR IT, BUT YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT HAS 15-FOOT FIRST FLOOR ON THE CORNER.
02:46:28.886: >> EVERY CORNER? PARKWAY, PLATT, CHALMERS... YOST...
02:46:46.036: >> I THINK YEAH.
02:46:47.004: >> I'M JUST TRYING TO.
02:46:48.639: >> YEAH, NO, I THINK THAT'S HELPFUL. THERE'S NOT THAT MANY CORNERS. THERE'S MORE CORNERS ON STADIUM, I THINK. THERE'S MORE CORNERS ON STADIUM, PARTICULARLY ON LIKE THE EAST SIDE OF STADIUM BECAUSE THERE'S A BUNCH THAT, YOU KNOW... THERE'S MORE CORNERS ON STADIUM, BUT HONESTLY THOSE ARE ALL PLACES WHERE CURRENTLY IT'S COMMERCIAL. ALL OF THAT IS COMMERCIAL, SO THIS IS NUT A CHANGE FROM THAT. WHICH IS A GOOD, LIKE, WE WANT TO SUPPLEMENT IT WITH HOUSING. WE DON'T WANT TO LOSE THAT COMMERCIAL. SO. I THINK ALL EXISTING CORNERS. FRONTING THE ALONG THE TRANSIT CORRIDOR.
02:47:40.190: >> THE YARD BY THE WAY IS AN 11-FOOT FIRST FLOOR.
02:47:50.367: >> I THINK THAT THE BUILDING ON THE CORNER, LIKE, THE - -
02:47:54.305: >> IT'S GOT AN ELEVATION.
02:47:56.140: >> OPEN BUILDING YEAH, IS DIFFERENT, YEAH. OKAY.
02:48:01.745: >> I THINK A YARD IS THE RIGHT EXAMPLE THERE'S APARTMENTS ON THE FIRST FLOOR AND THEN AS THE HILL GOES DOWN THE CEILING GOES UP AND RIGHT AT THE CORNER NEXT TO THE GAS STATION YOU'VE GOT A COMMON LOBBY. SORT OF THING.  I THINK THAT'S SORT OF ACTIVATED AS COMMERCIAL SPACE, MAYBE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SOMEBODY THAT'S IN THERE TO HAVE A SMALL BUSINESS, BUT ALSO NOT TO BE A BURDEN THAT THE FINANCIALS DON'T WORK FOR MIXED USE. I THINK THAT'S THE BIG THING. WE'RE NOT TRYING TO BE OVERLY PRESCRIPTIVE ON THE COMMERCIAL THAT THE PRO FORMA TO BALANCE IT ON SMALL PROPERTIES MAKES IT DIFFICULT. I GUESS ONE OF MY OTHER QUESTIONS ARE THERE OTHER... OR TO THE EXTENT OF THE BLOCK SIZE. I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S ANY 100-FOOT BLOCKS ANY ANY LITTLE POCKET STREETS OR ANYTHING. OR IF THERE ARE ANY SMALL IF IT'S A HUNDRED FEET FOR A BLOCK OVER X, THEN IT'S 50 FEET WE CAN ADJUST AND GET SOME FEEDBACK TO IT.
02:49:14.051: >> COULD IT BE THAT IT'S THE TOWN HOUSE SLASH APARTMENT BUILDING ITSELF THAT IS NOT PERMITTED WITHIN 100 FEET OF AN INTERSECTION. THE BUILDING HAS TO FOLLOW THICKSHOOD USE STANDARDS.  THE USES WITHIN COULD STILL BE 100 PERCENT RESIDENTIAL BUT IS THAT, WOULD THAT MEET THE INTENT?
02:49:38.008: >> IN MY MIND IT'S MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE BUILDING SOMETHING THERE THAT'S ADAPTABLE. I WOULD RATHER HAVE IT BE RESIDENTIAL NOW AND YOU CAN TURN IT INTO SOMETHING WHEN THAT BECOMES THE NEIGHBORHOOD CORNER. IN THE FUTURE. THAN HAVE IT BE LOCKED INTO TOWN HOMES FOREVER AND FOREGO THAT OPPORTUNITY. I'D WELCOME - -
02:49:59.797: >> YOU'RE SAYING A LOBBY WOULD WORK. IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING, ALEXIS?
02:50:04.368: >> NO, WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT THE BUILDING FORM LABELED APARTMENT TOWN HOMES IS NOT PERMITTED WITHIN 100 FEET OF AN INTERSECTION. THE FORM HAS TO BE THE MIXED USE BUILDING SO I'M REMOVING THE DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT USE IS IN THAT BUILDING.  I'M JUST SAYING THE TYPE OF FORM NEEDS TO BE MIXED USE. AND THEN THAT SEEMS TO GET AT THE DESIRE THAT IT'S FUTURE PROOF. BECAUSE IF THERE'S NOT GOING GOING TO, IT WAS ALL THAT OCCURRED TO ME THAT A DIFFERENT WAY TO APPROACH THE SAME TO GET TO THE SAME END RESULT AND MAYBE BY USING THE STRUCTURE THAT WE HAVE AND IF IT DIDN'T SEEM LIKE THE PARTICULAR USE THAT WAS IN THE BUILDING ON THE CORNER THERE WAS TALK ABOUT, IT WOULD BE GREAT IF IT COULD BE A COFFEE SHOP, BUT COMMISSIONER MILLS SAID I JUST WANT IT TO BE 15 FEET IN HEIGHT. SO THAT WAS A WAY TO APPROACH THIS ISSUE.
02:51:21.578: >> KIND OF A MENG AN K-L CONTEXT FOR MECHANICAL CONTEXT FOR COMMERCIAL I'M OKAY A LITTLE BIT YOUR WAY BUT HAVING GONE THROUGH EVEN A COUPLE OF NEW CONSTRUCTIONS WHERE IT WAS A GROUND FLOOR TENANT SPACE BUT OFFICES OR RESIDENTIAL ABOVE, TRYING TO PUT MECHANICAL FOR NEEDING ROOF TOP UNIT FOR THE HIGHER OCCUPANCY RATE, PUTTING A HOOD MAKEUP IN IT'S NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE WHEN YOU START TO THINK ABOUT OPERABILITY WINDOWS ABOVE FOR APARTMENTS, FINDING A CHASE, IF IT'S NOT BUILD BUILT IN, BECAUSE THE FIRST USE WAS PLANNED TO BE RESIDENTIAL, AND LIKE I SAID BEFORE, YOU TYPICALLY CONVERT INTO RESIDENTIAL YOU DON'T CONVERT OUT OF RESIDENTIAL EVEN IF IT'S 15 FEET. SO IF WE WANT TO SEE COMMERCIAL, I'D SAY MAKE IT MIXED USE. IF WE JUST WANT TO SAY 15 FEET, THEN WE CAN SAY 15 FEET. I DON'T THINK YOU'RE GOING TO GET AS MUCH COMMERCIAL IF WE DON'T HOLD THEM TO THAT STANDARD TO MAKE SOMETHING A LITTLE POCKET SHOP ON THE CORNER.
02:52:42.960: >> WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS WITHIN 100 FEET THERE HAS TO BE 1 COMMERCIAL SPACE SIZE UP TO THEM OR ALL, EVERYTHING ON THE GROUND FLOOR FOR 100 FEET HAS TO BE COMMERCIAL?
02:52:53.904: >> THE LATTER.
02:52:54.605: >> 100 LINEAR FEET OF COMMERCIAL SPACE, 15-FOOT HIGH CEILINGS.
02:53:00.510: >> WE DON'T SPECIFY THE DEPTH. IT COULD BE SHALLOW. THERE COULD BE PARKING BEHIND IT.
02:53:20.230: >> I'M JUST THINKING ABOUT SCALE A LITTLE BIT IF DOWNTOWN IS A 20-FOOT STORE FRONT THAT'S A DIFFERENT DENSITY BUT WE'RE PROBABLY TALKING TWO TO THREE TO FOUR SPACES.
02:53:43.186: >> DOWNTOWN BUILDING ARE 20 BY A HUNDRED MAX; RIGHT? SO YOU COULD IMAGINE IF THEY WENT 20-FOOT DEEP THAT THEIR 2,000 SQUARE FOOT RESTAURANT. IF YO WENT 20 FEET DEEP YOU AND PARKING BEHIND 2500-FOOT RESTAURANT OR TWO 1600 SQUARE FOOT SHOPS TO GIVE CONTEXT TOO. A SMALL COFFEE SHOP IS LIKE 1500 SQUARE FEET.
02:54:13.917: >> RIGHT.
02:54:16.853: >> MR. CARPENTER, GO AHEAD.
02:54:20.157: >> OH, UM, SORRY FOR THE INTERRUPTION, IT'S ABOUT 10 O'CLOCK AND I'M ABOUT TO TURN INTO A PUMPKIN. SO I JUST WANTED TO SAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING ME AND I'LL COORDINATE WITH BRETT AND ALEXIS ABOUT ANY FUTURE HELP THAT WE CAN BE.
02:54:36.006: >> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING.
02:54:41.511: >> WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE A BREAK IN A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE MY LAPTOP IS RUNNING OUT OF BATTERY I'VE GOT TO GO FIND MY POWER CORD. BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO BREAK THE FLOW. ALL THERE - - WE'VE MADE A LIST OF, I MEAN, THIS LAST ONE WAS DOING IT ON THE FLY, AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE IT WOULD GO IN HERE. SO I ALSO TRUST THIS TO BE TRANSLATED APPROPRIATELY BUT I'M NOT SURE HOW YOU ALEXIS AND BRETT ARE FEELING ABOUT THAT.
02:55:18.515: >> I THINK I WOULD LIKE YOU GUYS TO SORT OF REVIEW THIS LANGUAGE WE'VE, YOU KNOW, WE'RE SORT OF SHIFTING BACK WE START WOULD SOME REQUIRED MIXED USE COMPONENTS, WE WERE DIRECTED AWAY FROM THAT, NOW WE'RE SORT OF COMING BACK TO THAT IN A LIMITED FASHION SO I GUESS I WOULD PREFER TO WORK OUT SOME LANGUAGE AND PRESENT IT TO YOU. YOU KNOW, THE INTENT STUFF I FEEL LIKE WE CAN DO PRETTY QUICKLY.  THE PARKING WE CAN DO REALLY QUICKLY. THIS ON THE FLY CHANGES, LIKE, BASICALLY GOING TO A REQUIRED MIXED USE WITHIN DISTANCE, I JUST LIKE TO, I'D JUST LIKE A LITTLE BUT OF SPACE FOR US TO UNDERSTAND HOW THAT MIGHT RELATE TO THE OTHER REGULATIONS, IF WE SEE ANY ISSUES THERE OR THE LIKE. THAT'S THAT SAID IT'S INTERESTED IN MOVING RELATIVELY QUICKLY, E THINGS WE COULD LOOK AT IS I DON'T HAVE A LOT SCHEDULED FOR A WORKING SESSION, WE COULD CONVERT THAT TO A SPECIAL MEETING AND ALEXIS AND I COULD WORK TO TRY AND BE QUICK. BUT WE CAN WORK TO TRY AND PUT SOME OF THESE CHANGES TOGETHER THIS WEEKND SEND OUT AEVISED WITH OURRESPONSE ORORT OF HOW WE WOU ENVION TSE THINGS BEING ENACTED AND THAT WOULD GIVE US AND THE COMMISSION A LITTLE SPACE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE JUST ADDRESSING EVERYTHING. SO THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE MY PREFERENCE.  I'LL. ALTERNATIVELY, I'M HAPPY TO TAKE THAT DIRECTION AS WELL AND WE CAN WORK TO INCORPORATE THAT IN BEFORE IT PROGRESSES TO CITY COUNCIL. SO I THINK AGAIN MY PREFERENCE WOULD BE TO BRING IT BACK TO YOU BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE WE'VE BEEN SORT OF BOUNCING AROUND ON THIS PARTICULAR ASPECT AND JUST TO MAKE SURE THE PLANNING COMMISSION IS RESOLVED ON IT, I'M HAPPY TO FOLLOW YOUR PREFERENCE EITHER WAY.
02:57:23.807: >> MY SENSE IS THAT THE SECOND HALF OF THE REMIT THAT NEEDS TO GO TO CITY COUNCIL, WHICH IS, WHERE? IS SOMETHING THAT WE MAY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PULL OUT OF THIS, BUT I FEEL LIKE THERE'S A BIT OF A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION.  IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME. SO I WOULD LEAN TOWARDS IF THERE'S NOT ALREADY SOMETHING THAT IS OCCUPYING OUR WORKING SESSION NEXT WEEK THAT IF WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE VERY SHORT HOPEFULLY REVISIONS TO THE ORDINANCE ITSELF AND PARTICULARLY FOCUSING ON THIS ISSUE, AND THEN SPENDING MORE TIME NEXT WEEK TALKING AABOUT THAT PARAGRAPH OR WHATEVER THAT LOOKS LIKE ABOUT WHERE WE SHOULD FOCUS WITH WHERE THIS, WHERE THIS NEW DISTRICT IS APPROPRIATE. WOULD BE. I THINK THAT MIGHT MAKE SENSE. BECAUSE WE DO HAVE ONE MORE TWO MORE THINGS ON OUR AGENDA. ■ FLUSH.
02:58:19.562: >> THAT'S, YEAH, I AGREE WITH THAT.
02:58:21.398: >> IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE, THEN, IF THAT'S KIND OF OUR INTENTION, WHICH MEANS THAT WE WOULD GO FOR POSTPONEMENT, IN THE INTERIM IS THERE ANY CHANGES TO THE ORDINANCE LANGUAGE ITSELF THAT ANY COMMISSIONERS WANT TO BRING UP? AND THEN THE SECOND IS IN ORDER TO MAKE DECISION ON WHERE THIS IS APPROPRIATE, IS THERE ANYTHING WE WOULD WANT ADDITIONAL RESEARCH, YOU KNOW, LIKE DIGGING ON? IN MY MIND ONE OF THINGS THAT WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL GIVEN A LOT OF OUR CONVERSATION IS COULD YOU HELP DIG OUT WHAT THE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE, THE LAND USE FUTURE LAND USE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE ALONG INDUSTRIAL, ALONG THOSE CORRIDORS THAT HAVE GOTTEN BROUGHT INTO THE DISCUSSION AN AWFUL LOT? I THINK THAT WOULD HELP A LOT, ME MAKE SENSE OF THIS. COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL.
02:59:21.992: >> WE HAD A COUPLE OF CALLERS CALL IN ABOUT WASHTENAW IN PARTICULAR, AND I WOULD BE CURIOUS JUST TO SEE, SO ALEXIS STAY ON YOUR ROLE OF YOUR, THAT YOU'RE ON, WITH DOING YOUR GRAPHICS TO KIND OF SHOW IN A CLEAR WAY WHAT THAT COULD LOOK LIKE ALONG THERE. I THINK THAT'S A PRETTY GENERALIZED THING THAT I THINK PART OF WHAT YOU ALL HAVE DONE WITH THESE IS REALLY TRY TO RIGHT SIZE THEM WITH THE AREAS WE'RE LOOKING AT. THEY EACH HAVE PRETTY DIFFERENT SURROUNDING USES IN SOME WAYS. I WOULD BE CURIOUS TO SEE THAT JUST TO SEE WHAT WE'RE GETTING AND I REALIZE THAT WASHTENAW IS REALLY ON THE NORTH SIDE OF WASHTENAW, AND IT VERY LIKELY THEY WERE PEOPLE THAT WERE LIVING ALONG THE SOUTH SIDE UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE TO MAKE SURE WE'RE BEING SENSE TUSK TO THAT ADJACENT NEIGHBORHOOD.
03:00:19.082: >> TO THAT END, LIKE, CONTOURS OF WHERE THE 55-FOOT LINE AND 85-FOOT WHATEVER THE 85-FOOT LINE AND THEN THE 120-FOOT LINE COULD HELP.
03:00:39.235: >> YEAH, WHERE YOU CAN DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU ARE BECAUSE I'M SURE THAT THERE'S DIFFERENCES WITH LOT SIZES AND THINGS LIKE THAT.  BUT KIND OF GENERALLY SPEAKING HOW IT SHIFTS AS IT MOVES ALONG FROM SOME SENSE OF THAT IN YOUR REALLY BIG MASSING SENSE.
03:01:02.258: >> OTHER THINGS FOR DISCUSSION NEXT WEEK OF THESE?
03:01:11.201: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT: I DON'T THINK THIS WILL BE EASY PUTTING A LOT OF YOU GUYS FOR A WEEK, BUT WITH ADDING IN KEY IN R5 THE EXISTING MAP WITH THE PINK LINES AND ASSUMING THAT WILL CHANGE IN SOME PLACES WHERE THOSE LINES MIGHT BE. MAYBE I'M WRONG IN THINKING ABOUT EISENHOWER AND HOW THE SOUTH PORT WAS INCLUDED. IF THERE ARE CHANGES DUE TO BRINGING IN THOSE HOPEFULLY THAT'S AN EASY THING TO DO. MAYBE THERE AREN'T CHANGES.
03:01:43.766: >> OKAY. I WILL ENTERTAIN A MOTION TO POSTPONE UNTIL NEXT WEEK, MR. LEONARD, CAN - - CAN IT BE A DATE CERTAIN? ARE WE ABLE TO NOTICE IT APPROPRIATELY?
03:01:57.413: >> YEAH, WHAT I WOULD ASK IS FOR YOU TO TAKE ACTION TO CONVERT YOUR SCHEDULE 14 SESSION FOR THE 13TH. INTO A SPECIAL MEETING OF THE PLANNING COMMISSION THAT WE WOULD NOTICE THAT AS A REGULAR MEETING AND AS PART OF SO MOVE TO CONVERT THE WORKING SESSION INTO A SPECIAL MEETING AND POSTPONE CONSIDERATION OF THIS ACTION TO THAT AGENDA.
03:02:35.318: >> YOU WANT THAT MOTION TO...
03:02:36.519: >> AS I JUST SAID.
03:02:38.221: >> APRIL 13 WORKING SESSION TO A SPECIAL MEETING AND POSTPONE THIS TO THAT MOVE BY COMMISSIONER SAUVE SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER ABRONS, ANY DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT? OKAY DO A VOICE VOTE OR - -
03:02:52.202: >> VOICE VOTE.
03:02:54.103: >> EVERYBODY IN FAVOR RAISE YOURND OR SAY YES.
03:02:56.239: >> I'M RAISING MY HAND.
03:02:59.209: >> THANK YOU.
03:03:01.211: >> YEAH.
03:03:01.678: >> UM, ALL RIGHT. SO WE WILL TALK ABOUT THUS NEXT WEEK. THANK YOU TO ALL WHO CALLED IN. HOPEFULLY YOU WERE LISTENING TO THIS AND HEARD THAT THAT'S WHEN WE WILL TAKE THIS UP AGAIN. I DO NEED TO GO AND GET POWER CORD. LET'S RECONVENE AT 10:15 P.M. WHICH IS NINE AND A HALF MINUTES FROM NOW. THAT OKAY?
03:03:22.065: >> YEP. ALL RIGHT. SEE YOU THEN.
03:22:49.130: >> NO CALLERS ON THE LINE AT THIS TIME. SEEING NONE.
03:23:01.510: >> OKAY.  SO I'LL READ THE PROPOSED MOTION. THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION HERE STANDBY RECOMMENDS THE MARE AND CITY COUNCIL APPROVE AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND SECTION 5.16.6 OF CHAPTER 55 OF THE CITY CODE THE UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE TO AMEND HOME OCCUPATIONS REGULATIONS.  MOVED BY... COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT, SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER LEE.  ANY DISCUSSION?
03:23:45.053: >> COMMISSIONER DISCH THEN COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT.
03:23:50.492: >> COMMISSIONER DISCH:  IS THAT NORMALLY NOT PERMITTED?
03:23:52.961: >> SO THAT'S, UM, IT'S A NEW USE I THINK A LOT OF MEDICALLY AFFILIATED USES ARE NOT PERMITTED AS HOME OCCUPATION.  I DON'T PROFESS THAT I AM CLEAR ABOUT ANY SORT OF LICENSING REQUIREMENTS AS THEY WOULD RELATE TO PHYSICAL THERAPY, BUT I THINK THAT FOLLOWS IN THE PATTERN OF MEDICAL AND DENTAL OFFICES AND EKE EVEN TATTOO AND BODY PIERCING THAT MIGHT BE MORE SUITED TO A COMMERCIAL LOCATION THAN A RESIDENCE. A LOT OF THIS STRUCTURE COMES FROM SORT OF A MODEL OF NATIONAL PLANNING ASSOCIATION PUBLICATION ON COS. IT MODEL THEY UTILIZED WAS MUCH MORE SPECIFIC - - IT REFERENCED A LOT OF THE NATIONAL LABOR CODE ON NUMERICAL CODES FOR ALL A LOT OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF HOMMOCK OPATIONS.  I FELT THAT WAS PERHAPS A LITTLE BIT TOO DETAILED AND A LITTLE BIT TOO SPECIFIC. SO IN SHORT I WAS FOLLOWING CONVENTION OF SOME PROFESSIONAL RECOMMENDATION RESOURCES THAT RECOMMEND THIS, AND I WOULD SPECULATE THAT IT'S BECAUSE IT'S KIND OF A HEALTH ORIENTED TYPE FACILITY. BUT I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT IF THERE'S NOONSES THERE THAT WE SHOULD RECONSIDER.
03:25:20.115: >> I JUST KNOW THAT SOME PHYSICAL THERAPISTS, THIS IS MAYBE ST COMPLETORY DIFFERENT. SOME PHYSICAL THERAPISTS TRAVEL TO PEOPLES' HOMES AND TREAT THEM IN THEIR HOMES. THAT MIGHT NOT BE THE SAME BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE SAME AS NOT HAVING A COTTAGE PHYSICAL THERAPY IN MY HOUSE.
03:25:39.834: >> I THINK THAT WOULD BE DIFFERENT BUT IT'S NOT TO SAY THAT IT'S NOT WORTH CONSIDERING.
03:25:44.773: >> YEAH. I DON'T KNOW... CLEARLY IT'S SO MASSAGE THERAPY WOULD BE FINE. YEAH, OKAY, THAT MAKES SENSE TO ME, SUCH A BROAD CATEGORY. THERE'S THE KIND WHERE YOU GO TO THE GYM AND THEY MAKE YOU DO THINGS, YOU KNOW, WITH THE RUBBER BANDS AND STUFF, AND THEN THERE'S THE KIND THAT'S ON THE EDGE OF MASSAGE. SO I'M JUST TRYING TO PASSER THAT. PARSE THAT. I'M NOT RISING RAISING A BIG THING, I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT IT.
03:26:23.712: >> BUT IT'S A GOOD OBSERVATION IN THE WAY THAT MY GOAL HERE AND I'LL JUST SAY THAT I'VE SHARED THIS WITH MEMBERS OF MY TEAM HAVE WE EXPERIENCED OTHER OCCUPATIONS AS THIS CAME UP IT SEEMED TO BE INCLUSIVE. I THINK IT'S GENERALLY INCLUSIVE AND I AM IN A WAY BUT IF SOMETHING DOESN'T FIT INTO ONE OF THESE CATEGORIEST'S PROBABLY NOT GOING TO BE PERMITTED. SO I JUST THINK IT'S A BALANCE. I DIDN'T TRY TO GENERALIZE SERVICES, COUNSELING, BUT THIS IS INTENDING TO LIST THICKS, MORE THINGS, TO BE MORE SPECIFIC BUT IT COULD BE A COINCIDENCE. I THINK THE STRUCTURE IS GOOD. BUT I THINK THAT'S A BIT OF A TRADE-OFF.
03:27:22.103: >> SO TO CLARIFY, COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT, I KNOW YOU HAD YOUR HAND UP BUT I JUST WANT TO FOLLOW-UP ON THIS. IT'S ON THE PERMITTED LIST, IT'S PERMITTED SO LONG AS YOU FOLLOW THE GUIDELINES IN SECTION 5. IF IT'S EXEMPT, THEN YOU CAN DO IT. LIKE, NO, LIKE - -
03:27:40.588: >> RIGHT, YEAH.
03:27:41.856: >> SUBJECT TO OTHER CITY ORDINANCES WE STILL HAVE A NOISE ORDINANCE., RIGHT? BUT IF IT'S NOT LISTED OR IT'S EXPLICITLY PROHIBITED, IT'S PROHIBITED IS THAT RIGHT?
03:27:54.202: >> YEP.
03:27:55.704: >> OKAY. GOT IT. THANK YOU. COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT.
03:28:00.775: >> THIS IS NOT WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY, AND I'M GOING TO TRY TO BE VAGUE, AND NOT GET INTO ANY TROUBLE I HAD SOME SORT OF IT WASN'T QUITE PHYSICAL THERAPY, I'M FORGETTING THE NAME OF IT, BUT I HEARD ABOUT IT MY PHYSICAL THERAPIST KNEW ABOUT IT AND IT WASN'T REALLY MASSAGE BUT IT WAS DEFINITELY IN MY HOUSE. IF IT'S ANY TYPE OF PHYSICAL THERAPY THAT WOULD NO LONGER BE ALLOWED.  I DON'T KNOW EVEN KNOW IT'S ALLOWED NOW.
03:28:31.940: >> YEAH, I MEAN, IT'S A GREAT, YOU KNOW, WE'RE INTENDING TO PROVIDE PERSONAL CARE SERVICES WHICH I WOULD SAY IS MASSAGE AND THE LIKE, BUT MY INITIAL REACTION IS I THINK OF PHYSICAL THERAPY AS OFTEN SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BE PRESCRIBED, IT MIGHT BE SORT OF MORE DIRECTED BY A PHYSICIAN OR SOMETHING IN CONJUNCTION OF SOME OTHER CARE. BUT IT, YOU KNOW, I YOU KNOW, I THINK THESE ARE GREAT EXAMPLES. IF IT FALLS UNDER PERSONAL CARE, I THINK IT WOULD BE PERMITTED.
03:29:06.841: >> THAT SEEMS LIKE DO WE HAVE A DEAF RIGGS INFOR - - DEFINITION OF THAT?
03:29:14.149: >> YEAH, YEP. AND IT WOULD BE.
03:29:16.251: >> YEAH. OKAY, MY, THE THING I WAS REALLY GOING TO SAY AND I KNOW I BROUGHT THIS UP AT ORC, I'M JUST GOING TO SAY IT AGAIN, PERMITTED USE IS ONLINE SALES THERE PROHIBITED USE IS RETAIL SALES AND I DON'T KNOW IF WE NEED TO BE... SAYING RETAIL THE PIECE WHERE IT'S LIKE WE MEAN A PHYSICAL LOCATION OR DO WOULD IT BE MORE CLEAR SINCE APPARENTLY I KEEP GETTING TRIPPED UP OVER THIS, I MIGHT NOT BE THE ONLY ONE, IF WE SAID ON SITE RETAIL SALES?
03:29:50.151: >> UM... SO...
03:29:52.220: >> OR IS IT THE FACT THAT ONLINE SALES IS PERMITTED ENOUGH THAT HAVING RETAIL SALES.
03:29:58.393: >> I WOULD SAY THAT MAIL ORDER AND ONLINE SALES IS PERMITTED. RETAIL, I WOULD SAY, IS PEOPLE COMING TO THE HOME TO PURCHASE SOMETHING.
03:30:10.772: >> FOR SOME REASON IN MY HEAD THAT'S NOT WHERE I'M GOING, SELLING, LIKE EXCHANGE, REGARDLESS OF THE - -
03:30:17.512: >> YEAH, I MEAN, THAT'S HOW I WOULD, I'D HAVE TO CHECK.  I COULD CHECK OUR CODE FOR RETAIL I DOUBT IT'S DEFINED.  THAT'S HOW I WOULD THINK OF IT WHERE SPECIFICALLY THIS SAYS YOU CAN'T, THIS DOESN'T ALLOW YOU TO STOCK INVENTORY AND HAVE PEOPLE COME AND PURCHASE STUFF ON YOUR PROPERTY. IT EXPRESSLY ALLOWS YOU TO BE A MIDDLE SORT OF IMPORTER OR SOMETHING AND ARRANGE SALES OR MAKE SALES ONLINE. LET ME TAKE A MINUTE AND SEE IF WE'VE DEFINED RETAIL. THAT'S HOW I THINK ABOUT RETAIL, IS I CAN JUST GO IN WITHOUT AN APPOINTMENT OR WITHOUT AN ARRANGEMENT AND PURCHASE SOMETHING.
03:31:04.259: >> OKAY.
03:31:08.830: >> I SEE HANDS, I SAW A COMMISSIONER LEE BEFORE. COMMISSIONER CLARKE, AND THEN COMMISSIONER DISCH.
03:31:17.672: >> IT'S A REALLY SMALL THING KIND OF - -
03:31:21.276: >> RELATED?
03:31:21.843: >> YEAH. AND I WAS JUST CURIOUS I SAW IT SAID MAIL ORDER AND/OR ONLINE SALES BUT IT SAYS NO ON PREMISES INVENTORY WOULD BE PERMITTED. I'M CURIOUS WHAT THE NO ON PREMISES INVENTORY MEANS.  IF YOU HAVE A CLOSET FULL OF STUFF YOU SELL ON E-BAY FOR SOMEONE DOES THAT COUNT?  IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE MAKING POST OFFICE RUNS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT'S, OR DOES THAT REALLY JUST MEAN YOU CAN'T HAVE A FULL WAREHOUSE IN YOUR... I'M CURIOUS IF THERE'S ANY DEFINITION ON THAT.
03:31:54.108: >> I THINK THE SHORT ANSWER WOULD BE THE CLOSET WOULD PROBABLY BE FINE UNTIL YOU GET SO EXPANSIVE AND START SPILLING OUT AND NOT BEING ABLE TO MEET THE OTHER REQUIREMENTS.  WE COULD TRY TO REFINE THAT MORE, BUT RIGHT NOW I THINK IT WOULD PROVIDE SOME FLEXIBILITY. LET ME ANSWER RETAIL NOW.  I THOUGHT I COULD DO A MULTI-TASK, BUT...
03:32:24.973: >> THEY ARE LINKED.
03:32:27.108: >> YEAH, RETAIL'S NOT DEFINED. SO SORRY, IT IS. A FACILITY OR AREA FOR THE RETAIL SALE OF GENERAL MERCHANDISE FOR DIRECT CONSUMPTION AND NOT FOR WHOLESALE.  TYPICAL MERCHANDISE INCLUDES CLOTHING GIFTS FLOWERS WHOLESALE PLANTS.  SO —
03:32:52.000: >> BECAUSE IT SAYS FACILITIES.
03:32:52.633: >> YEAH. FACILITY OR AREA FOR RETAIL SALE OF GENERAL MUMPND ICE TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC.
03:33:04.178: >> OKAY. I SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO JUST WANDER INTO YOUR HOUSE AND BUY A STOOL.
03:33:10.485: >> RIGHT.
03:33:12.553: >> I MIGHT BE ABLE TO E-MAIL YOU AND SAY HEY, I LOVE YOUR STOOLS CAN WE SET UP AN AN APPOINTMENT.
03:33:19.994: >> OKAY.
03:33:20.395: >> NO MORE IT UPPERWARE.
03:33:22.997: >> WELL THEN IT'S THEIR HOME THAT'S THE PLACE OF BUSINESS. LIKE, I DON'T KNOW.
03:33:31.773: >> SO THAT'S RETAIL SO BACK TO INVENTORY. NO STORAGE OF GOODS AND MATERIAL SHOULD BE INSIDE... [READING TO SELF] . FLUSH. DELIVERY SHALL OCCUR... YEAH, I THINK YOU CAN HAVE, YOU CAN STORE GOODS AND MATERIALS, YOU CAN'T HAVE RETAIL SALES, YOU CAN'T HAVE ON PREMISE INVENTORY. YEAH, I MEAN, RIGHT NOW THIS WOULD SAY THAT TECHNICALLY YOU COULDN'T HAVE IT IN YOUR CLOSET.
03:34:50.751: >> IF YOU'RE MAKING GOODS, THIS IS A FOLLOW-UP TO THAT, COMMISSIONER CLARKE, IS YOURS A FOLLOW-UP DIRECTLY TO THAT?  GO FOR IT.
03:35:01.329: >> I WAS JUST GOING TO FOLLOW-UP ON THAT BECAUSE IF SOMEONE HAS AN ETSY STORE YOU CAN DO THIRD PARTY LIKE AMAZON WHERE YOU JUST ARE MIDDLEMEN, YOU BROKER THE GOODS WHERE THEY'RE IN THE WAREHOUSE, YOU ADVERTISE THE AND THEY GET SHIED DIRECTLY FROM AMAZON.  BUT PEOPLE WHO DO THEIOWN SHIPPG, I MN, TRACK TM DOWN A FINE THEMTO BUT YOU NEVER KNOW IF SOMEBODY COULD GET A HEADACHE OR HASSLE OF A NEIGHBOR. I WOULD WANT TO KNOW MORE SPECIFICALLY HOW MUCH MAYBE INVENTORY THERE COULD BE OR MAYBE IF THERE'S A WAY OF APPROACHING THAT THAT MIGHT BE A LITTLE CLEARER AND LESS PRONE TO KIND OF - - IT SEEMS LIKE THE SMALLER PEOPLE WOULD BE MORE IMPACTED BY THAT THAN THE LARGER RETAILERS WHO ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE OFF PREMISES WAREHOUSES.
03:35:48.109: >> WHAT DO YOU HAVE IN MIND?  I REMEMBER IF IT'S ART, IF IT'S CRAFT WORK, THOSE ARE EXEMPT ACTIVITIES. SO IF YOUR CLOSET IS FILLED WITH CUTTING BOARDS THAT YOU'RE MAKING, THEN AS LONG AS IT'S NOT RETAIL SALES THAT'S NOT AN ISSUE. LING. I THINK THAT THE INVENTORY ISSUE WOULD BE AN ISSUE WHERE YOU ARE FOR EXAMPLE CRAFT COTTAGE FOODS WE TALKED ABOUT. THAT'S CLEARLY PERMISSIBLE. YOU COULD HAVE A CLOSET FULL OF YOUR PRESERVES OR YOUR MAPLE SYRUP OR WHAT'S HAVE YOU. I CAN'T COME IN THERE, KNOCK ON YOUR DOOR TO BUY IT, BUT YOU CAN HAVE THOSE MATERIALS.  I THINK THE INVENTORY IS, AND MAYBE THE LANGUAGE NEEDS TO BE REFINED, BUT I THINK IT'S PROBABLY MORE AKIN TO PURCHASING WHOLESALE MATERIAL GRANULES AND THEN RETAILING THEM.
03:36:53.407: >> I CAN'T QUITE HEAR YOU, COULD YOU STEP A LITTLE CLOSER?
03:36:56.877: >> CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW?
03:36:58.379: >> A LITTLE BETTER TRY AGAIN.
03:37:01.015: >> I DON'T KNOW.  UM, SO, LIKE, IF SOMEONE IS CONSIGNMENT SECOND HAND GOODS LIKE ON DESIGNER CLOTHES OR SOMETHING, THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WOULDN'T REALLY FIT INTO MAKING YOUR OWN THINGS AND SOMEBODY THEY MIGHT GET PACKAGES MAILED TO THEM THAT THEY THEN RESELL. I MEAN, THAT'S A PRETTY COMMON THING THAT PEOPLE DO? A. JUST WONDERING IF THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE - -
03:37:24.238: >> TECHNICALLY COULD DO THAT AS LONG AS YOU WERE SORT OF A MIDDLE MAN AND NOT MAINTAINING INVENTORY. I THINK UNDER THIS CURRENT DRAFT THAT WOULD NOT BE PERMISSIBLE. YOU'D HAVE TO GET ONE OF THOSE COMMERCIAL SPACES WITHIN A HUNDRED FEET OF AN INTERSECTION.
03:37:46.894: >> COMMISSIONER LEE, AND THEN COMMISSIONER DISCH.
03:37:49.730: >> SURE, THANK YOU. I WANTED TO SWITCH GEARS A LITTLE BIT TO SIGNAGE. UNDER 1B, WHICH IS REDACTED AT THE VERY TOP, IT SAYS OUTSIDE APPEARANCES OF THE PREMISES SHALL HAVE NO VISIBLE EVIDENCE OF A HOME OCCUPATION.  SO WE'VE LOWERED THAT STANDARD TO WHAT'S IS NOW PROPOSED, AND SAYS DO NOT VISUALLY CALL UNUSUAL ATTENTION TO THE HOME. SO WE ARE GOING FROM NO VISIBLE EVIDENCE TO LET'S NOT CALL UNUSUAL ATTENTION. SO I WANTED US TO TALK ABOUT HOW ARE WE, I MEAN, I THINK THE ORDINANCE IS TIMELY. WE ALL HAVE TO KIND OF GET WITH THE TIMES. WHAT WAS OUR FIRST, SECOND, AND THIRD PLACE, OUR UNIQUE CATEGORIZATION OF RESIDENTIAL OR WORK. OUR HOMEWORK AND OUR HOBBIES KIND OF GOT BLURRED DURING COVID. I THINK THIS IS IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.  WITH RESPECT TO SIGNAGE AND WHETHER AN ACCOUNTANT OR A LAWYER STARTS TO ADVERTISE, PUT LIKE A LITTLE SIGN, AND IT MIGHT NOT BE UNUSUAL BUT I GUESS I'M LIKE THINKING ABOUT WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE RIDE MIGHT BIKE THROUGH SEVENTH STREET NEIGHBORHOODS LIKE THERE'S AN ACCOUNTANT THAT LIVES THERE. YOU 22 ASEE KIND OF WHERE I'M GET - - DO YOU SEE KIND OF WHERE I'M GETTING AT WITH THAT. I WANT TO HAVE A LITTLE DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT IS APPROPRIATE. WE ARE RECOGNIZE STANDARD AND THE REALITY THAT THE FIRST AND SECOND PLACE HAS BEEN MARRED AND WE SHOULD ADDRESS IT. I THINK AGAIN, I REALLY LIKE THE INTENT OF THIS ORDINANCE BUT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT SIGNAGE BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S GOING TO HAVE A BIGGER KIND OF INFLUENCE ON OUR BUILT ENVIRONMENT OR OUR FORUM. SO BRAD, IF YOU COULD GIVE ME LITTLE WHAT YOU SEE AS A LESSENING OF - -
03:39:45.713: >> THAT'S A GREAT OBSERVATION, BUT SO RIGHT NOW OUR CURRENT ORDINANCE IS IN CONFLICT WITH OUR SIGN ORDINANCE. RECENTLY ADOPTED SIGN ORDINANCE PROVIDES AND ALLOWEDS FOR SIGNAGE FOR HOMES.  AND THAT COMES FROM, FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT WERE ON FOR MANY, MANY SIGNAGE DISCUSSIONS, PART OF THAT IS A BALANCE OF THOSE SORT OF PHYSICAL ESTHETIC IMPACTS AND FIRST AMENDMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND A BRIEF SYNOPSIS OF THERE HAVE BEEN RECENTLY BEEN CASE LAW THAT AT THE SUPREME COURT THAT SAYS SIGN ORDINANCES THAT YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT WHAT THE CONTENT ARE IN ORDER TO DETERMINE IF THEY'RE PERMISSIBLE OR NOT ARE LIKELY ILLEGAL.  SO WE CRAFTED, WE DON'T HAVE AN ABILITY TO SAY HOMES ARE OKAY TO HAVE A SIGNAGE THAT SAYS THIS IS A HISTORIC HOME, THIS IS THE LEE HOME FROM 1840, YOU KNOW, 1847, THAT'S PROBABLY A LITTLE EARLY, 1897, BUT NOT ARROW LEE'S ACCOUNTING SERVICES. AND SO ONE OF THE IMPACTS OF THIS CHANGE, AND I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT IT UP, IT EXPLICITLY GETS RID OF THAT PROHIBITION THAT SAYS THERE'S NOTHING ON THE OUTSIDE BECAUSE RIGHT NOW OUR SIGN ORDINANCE AFFIRM AFFIRMATIVELY SAYS YOU CAN PUT THE HOME OR THE ACCOUNTANT. SO THE INTENTION OF THIS IS TO HOPE HOPEFULLY BY REGULATIONS AND THE WAY YOU HAVE TO CONDUCT THE HOME OCCUPATION, HAS TO BE EXTERIOR, CAN'T CREATE NUISANCES, IS TO PROVIDE SOME LEVEL OF LESSENING OF POTENTIAL IMPACT FOR THIS USE IN OUR OTHERWISE A RESIDENTIAL SETTING, BUT AS IT RELATES TO SIGNAGE THAT IN A WAY THAT SHOULD RESALE.
03:42:13.928: >> GOTCHA.
03:42:16.063: >> DOES THAT GET TO YOUR QUESTION?
03:42:18.299: >> YEAH.  100 PERCENT.  THE MORE YOU KNOW.  LIKE, THE KNOWLEDGE STAR JUST WENT LIKE THAT.  SO THANK YOU. THAT'S ACTUALLY REALLY HELPFUL. SO YOU THINK THAT THE UNUSUAL ATTENTION TO THE HOME IS KIND OF A SUFFICIENT CATCH ALL FOR THAT VISUALLY CALL UNUSUAL ATTENTION?
03:42:37.918: >> UM, I, WHAT IS IT?  I THINK IT'S A GOOD POINT, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TO YOU? BUT IT'S INTENDED, IT'S SORT OF INTENDED TO ESTABLISH THE INTENTION; RIGHT?
03:42:47.194: >> SURE. AND I THINK I'M KIND OF ON BOARD IT'S JUST WANT SOME LEVEL OF ARCHITECTURAL CONTINUITY SO YOU DON'T HAVE SOME BRIGHT FLASHING LIGHTS SAYING COME BY CONSIGNMENT GOODS AT KIND OF THE LEATHER GENERAL GOODS STORE.
03:43:07.781: >> ELECTRONIC MESSAGING CAN ONLY CHANGE THOUGH MORE THAN ONCE PER MINUTE.
03:43:18.892: >> I THINK MY CONCERN SLASH JUST INQUIRY REGARDING THAT IS DONE. THE ONLY THING I WANTED TO POINT OUT DELIVERIES, PICKUPS, I KNOW IT'S LATE, BUT LET ME POINT OUT DELIVERIES PICKUPS SHALL OCCUR 8:00 A.M., 8:00 P.M. MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY.  I DON'T KNOW HOW EARLY AMAZON DELIVERS MY THINGS BUT THEY SHOW UP ON MY DOORSTEP NOT THAT I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE MATERIALLY INTERFERING WITH ANY KIND OF OTHER KINDS OF OPERATIONS, BUT I JUST WANT TO ALSO BE COGNIZANT THAT THERE'S A REALITY THAT, YOU KNOW, I GUESS DELIVERY SERVICES, UNLESS I'M MISTAKEN, UPS AND AMAZON TRUCKS DON'T COME DURING SLEEPING HOURS. ACTUALLY, I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S THE CASE OR NOT.
03:44:08.075: >> I THINK TYPICALLY THEY COME DURING WITHIN THAT RANGE, BUT YEAH.  I'M SURE, I AM SURE THAT OCCASIONALLY THERE IS AN EXCEPTION.
03:44:18.285: >> GOT IT. THAT'S ALL THE QUESTIONS I HAD. THANK THANK YOU.
03:44:24.792: >> COMMISSIONER DISCH.
03:44:25.359: >> YES, I WANTED TO FOLLOW THE LINE OF ARGUMENT THAT COMMISSIONER CLARKE WAS PURSUING JUST BECAUSE PEOPLE SELL BOOKS ON A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT SITES. PEOPLE SELL FURNITURE THEY DON'T WANT ANYMORE ON CRAIG'S LIST. IT WOULD BE TOTALLY UNENFORCEABILITY TO PROHIBITED THAT — UNENFORCEABLE TO PROHIBIT THAT BUT THE LANGUAGE OF NO INVENTORY ON SITE WOULD SEEM TO PROHIBIT BECAUSE I WOULD HAVE, YOU KNOW, THE DINING ROOM TABLE THAT I JUST SOLD BECAME INVENTORY WHEN I ADVERTISED IT AND DECIDED I DIDN'T WANT TO USE IT ANYMORE. AND IT WAS ON SITE. SO I DON'T KNOW IF WE CAN MODIFY THAT OR SAY THINGS LIKE WHATEVER, I DON'T KNOW, WHAT DO WE CALL CRAIG'S LIST? IS THERE A CATEGORY OF THING THAT THAT IS?
03:45:25.953: >> THAT'S NOT REALLY A HOME OCCUPATION, I WOULD SAY, MOSTLY. I MEAN, IT'S POSSIBLE SOMEBODY'S USING IT FOR THAT, BUT YOU SELLING YOUR DINING ROOM TABLE, YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT, THAT'S NOT YOUR OCCUPATION.
03:45:38.866: >> NO.  OKAY. SO THAT, OKAY, SO THAT IS HELPFUL TO REMEMBER.
03:45:45.072: >> BUT NONETHELESS TO YOUR POINT, PROBABLY AN EASY WAY TO ADDRESS THAT WOULD BE JUST TO STRIKE SO JUST TO LEAVE THE DESCRIPTION TO BE MAIL ORDER OR ONLINE SALE SALES BUSINESS AND JUST STRIKE NO ON PREMISES.
03:45:59.553: >> OKAY. YEAH.
03:46:05.292: >> I MEAN, TO BE CLEAR, I STILL THINK THAT PROHIBITS PEOPLE COMING IN, IT'S NOT A RETAIL SPACE WHERE I CAN JUST WALTZ IN AND BUY YOUR DINING ROOM TABLE.
03:46:15.035: >> RIGHT.
03:46:15.369: >> OR AT THE DINING ROOM TABLE STORE.
03:46:20.073: >> RIGHT.
03:46:21.375: >> BUT IT WOULD JUST ELIMINATE THAT CONFLICT.
03:46:24.978: >> YEAH.  NO, I THINK THE BIG DIFFERENCE IS PEOPLE WALKING IN OFF THE STREET INTO MY HOUSE JUST BECAUSE I HAVE A NEON SIGN THAT SAYS COME BUY MY FURNITURE AND I HAVE 12 DINING ROOM TABLES, THAT BEGINS TO LOOK LIKE AN INVENTORY.
03:46:42.563: >> WHY DO YOU HAVE SO MANY DINING ROOM TABLES?
03:46:45.199: >> IT'S A COMPULSN.  FLUSH.
03:46:50.204: >> SHE'S DECLUTTERRING, SO I APPRECIATE IT, SO IT'S A TEMPORARY OCCUPATION. COMMISSIONER SAUVE. I'M SORRY, COMMISSIONER DISCH, ARE YOU ALL DONE?  YOU MUTED YOURSELF SO I ASSUMED.
03:47:00.914: >> YEAH.
03:47:01.648: >> OKAY, COMMSIONER SAUVE. SOMETHING LIKE WEST SIDE ART HOP.  IS THAT LIKE AN EVENT THAT THEY PULL A PERMIT FOR WHEN ALL THE ARTISTS SELL OUT OF THEIR GARAGE FOR A WEEKEND?
03:47:19.399: >> YEAH, I WOULD SAY THAT'S MORE LIKE A SPECIAL EVENT. AND AGAIN IF YOU, YOU CAN PRODUCE ART AND HAVE UP TO 12 PEOPLE COME TO LOOK. YOU CAN'T OPEN AN ART GALLERY AND HAVE PEOPLE WALK IN WITHOUT RESTRICTION TO THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE AT ANY TIME. YOU KNOW? I KNOW IT'S A SMALL DISTINCTION, BUT I WOULD SAY THAT IN THAT CASE, THEY ARE OPENING IT MORE GENERALLY, BUT IT'S PROBABLY FRANKLY MORE AKIN TO A GARAGE SALE THAN THE DAY TO DAY OPERATION OF THE HOME OCCUPATION.
03:47:55.569: >> OKAY, COOL. AND THEN MOTION TO REMOVE NO ON PREMISES INVENTORY FOR ANY ONLINE SALES BECAUSE I THINK, YEAH, LIKE FOR VINTAGE CLOTHES OR BOOKS, OESALING, THOSE FOOTPRINT  OPERATION ANDLY TRAFFIC AND THIS LIKE THAT. SO I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO PUT AN UNDUE BURDEN ON THE OPPORTUNITY FOR ONLINE SALES.
03:48:25.065: >> IN A WAY IF WE SAY THAT 25%, LIKE, WHAT DOES IT MATTER IF IT'S DESKS OR BOXES.
03:48:34.408: >> EXACTLY.
03:48:35.008: >> THAT WAS MOVED BY COMMISSIONER SAUVE. ANYONE WANT TO SECOND IT?
03:48:42.082: >> COMMISSIONER ABRONS? ANY DISCUSSION OF THE PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO STRIKE THE PROHIBITION ON ON-SITE INVENTORY, ON-PREMISES INVENTORY?  ALL IN FAVOR OF THE AMENDMENT, PLEASE RAISE YOUR HAND OR SAY YES. COMMISSIONER DISCH.  YES, I HEARD THAT. EXCELLENT. OKAY, SO NOW WE HAVE AN AMENDED MOTION.  COMMISSIONER SAUVE, DID YOU HAVE ANYTHING ELSE?  OKAY. YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE ART HOP AND THAT ACTUALLY RELATES TO THE THING THAT I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT WHICH IS IT'S REALLY MORE UNDER THE SECOND CATEGORY OF EXEMPTION WHICH IS CRAFT WORK. BEFORE YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT ETSY TALKING ABOUT MAKING CUTTING BOARDS; RIGHT? WHICH IS WOODWORKING. AND THAT IS NOT, IT IS LIKE LIKE A LOOPHOLE HERE, IT'S NOT MENTIONED ANYWHERE. I TOOK WHAT YOU WERE SAYING AS THAT FALLS UNDER CRAFT WORK, BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE CLEARER IF WE WERE EXPLICIT BECAUSE WHEN I BROUGHT THIS UP WITH THE MAKER IN MY LIFE IT WAS INTERPRETED THAT THAT ACTIVITY MIGHT FALL UNDER MACHINE SHOP, LIKE THAT WAS THE ONLY OTHER ONE THAT COULD MAYBE FALL UNDER. SO BUT IT'S A MORE GENERAL THING THAT, LIKE, WE ARE A TOWN THAT HAS MAKERS; RIGHT?  WE HAVE THE MAKER FAIRE, MAKER SPACE, MAKER WORKS. AND I THINK A LOT OF WHETHER IT'S APPARENTLY WE HAVE A COUPLE OF PEOPLE IN TOWN WHO MAKE BICYCLES FROM THEIR HOMES? THEY'RE LIKE WORLD FAMOUS BICYCLES, AND OTHER THINGS LIKE THAT WHICH I DON'T KNOW IF YOU, I MEAN, I DON'T THINK THAT THOSE THINGS ALL FALL UNDER CRAFTS BUT THEY FALL UNDER, LIKE, MAKING WHICH IS MAYBE A NEW TERMINOLOGY? I WONDER IF WE SHOULD BE MORE EXPANSIVE IN WHAT WE MEAN BY MAKING TO INCLUDE THINGS LIKE THE WOODWORKING FOR THE CUTTING BOARDS OR 3D PRINTING. THAT'S ANOTHER THING THAT PEOPLE ARE MAKING, SOMETIMES IN THEIR, YOU KNOW, BASEMENTS, THAT'S NOT IN HERE. WE TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE.  IT CAN BE NOISY BUT THEN THERE'S NOSE NOISE LIMITS THAT THEY'RE STILL BEHOLDEN TO IF IT'S UNDER THE SECTION THREE THEN THEY WOULD BE BEHOLDEN TO THAT. IF IT'S UNDER SECTION TWO THEY'RE STILL BEHOLDEN TO THE NOISE LIMITS OF THE CITY'S GENERAL NOISE LIMITS.
03:51:21.208: >> SO WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO ADD?
03:51:22.809: >> I GUESS THAT'S MORE OF A QUESTION.
03:51:24.744: >> SHOULD BE PERMITTED OR EXEMPT?  LIKE SO I SORT OF THINK LIKE FOR THOSE EXAMPLES I JUST WANT TO FIGURE OUT ONE, WHICH CATEGORY IS IT IN. I DON'T THINK OF, I SEE THE MACHINE SHOP.  THAT FOR ME, MY READ OF THAT IS ACTUALLY THAT IT'S MORE OF A TOOL AND DYE KIND OF ACTIVITY AS OPPOSED TO SOMEBODY THAT HAS A TABLE SAW. I CAN SEE WHEN YOU'RE SCANNING THIS TO SEE WHERE IT FITS. I CAN SEE THAT WOODWORKER, FOR EXAMPLE, DOESN'T, I THINK IT COULD FALL UNDER ARTIST. IT COULD FALL UNDER CRAFT WORK, BUT IT'S NOT EXPLICIT. WHEN WE START LISTING THAT, IF WE INCLUDE WOODWORKING AND BICYCLE MAKERS, BUT NOT BIRD HOUSES. I'M HAPPY TO EXPLORE WHATEVER THE COMMISSION THINKS.
03:52:30.143: >> COMMISSIONER SAUVE.
03:52:33.346: >> COULD YOU SAY LIMITED RUN PRODUCTION NOT MASS MANUFACTURED?  IT'S REALLY IN THAT KIND OF BESPOKE SCALE IS WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE.
03:52:46.226: >> SO PERMITTED RIGHT NOW FOR EXAMPLE IN EQUIVALENT WE HAVE FINE ARTS STUDIO CREATIVE INDIVIDUAL WORKS ONLY NO MASS PRODUCTION. SO SOME SORT OF WE DON'T CARE WHAT YOU'RE MAKING AS LONG AS IT MEETS THAT DEFINITION.
03:53:01.541: >> DO YOU WANT TO REFINE IT TO MAKER ARTS AND CRAFTS STUDIO? INSTEAD OF FINE ART?
03:53:09.449: >> I WAS GOING TO SAY YEAH, IT DOESN'T FALL IN FINE ART, BUT I LIKE THAT.
03:53:13.987: >> I DON'T... I DON'T LOVE MAKER. THAT CAN BE ANYTHING.  I MEAN, I LIKE THE ETHIC, BUT THAT, IF THAT IS OUR DESIRE TO BE SO BROAD THAT MAKING THINGS, I WOULD SUGGEST THAT MAYBE I NEED TO GO BACK AND RECONSIDER WHAT WE HAVE NOW. YOU KNOW, THE INTENTION HERE IS TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE SPECIFIC, THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT ARE PERMITTED, THESE ARE THINGS PROHIBITED. MAKER, THAT IS, THAT COULD BE ANYTHING.
03:53:53.693: >> UM, COMMISSIONER ABRONS AND COMMISSIONER CLARKE THEN.
03:53:57.664: >> I WAS JUST GOING TO OFFER UP CUSTOM AS A WORD.  LIKE, WHICH IS JUST MORE PEOPLE KNOW THAT WORD THAN BESPOKE.  BUT COULD BE CUSTOM CRAFT.  COULD BE LIKE CUSTOM CRAFT WORK.  OR SORRY AND I ALSO WAS THINKING THE WORD ARTISANAL WHICH PEOPLE MAY HAVE AN ALLERGIC REACTION TO, BUT ALSO GETS AT THIS IDEA OF SOMETHING WHICH IS HANDMADE AND NOT MANUFACTURED, POSSIBLY CUSTOM, BUT IS NOT NECESSARILY FINE ART OR CRAFTS.  I DON'T KNOW IF A BICYCLE CAN BE ARTISANAL.
03:54:33.266: >> BREAD CAN BE ARTISANAL.
03:54:36.336: >> COMMISSIONER CLARKE.
03:54:36.870: >> YEAH, I WAS JUST GOING TO SUGGEST ARTISAN GOODS.
03:54:43.209: >> CAN YOU SAY IT - -
03:54:44.544: >> I WAS JUST GOING GOING TO SUGGEST ARTISAN GOODS. PRETTY MUCH THE SAME.
03:54:49.816: >> WELL, I WOULD SAY ARTISTIC PRODUCT IS EXEMPT NOW. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN ARTISAN GOODS AND ARTISTIC PRODUCT IS.
03:55:00.827: >> I THINK ONLY THAT SOMEBODY WHO MAKES CUTTING BOARDS MAY NOT CONSIDER THEMSELVES TO BE AN ARTIST, SCULPTOR, COMPOSE COMPOSER, OR A CRAFT PERSON, BUT THEY MIGHT CONSIDER THEMSELVES TO BE A MAKER OF ARTISAN GOODS. IT MIGHT BE AS SIMPLE AS SAYING CRAFT WORK AND ARTISAN GOODS SUCH AS... I THINK, IT WAS IN MY MIND, THE JEWELRY MAKING SUGGESTED SOMETHING OF A DIFFERENT SCALE THAN A HANDMADE BICYCLE; RIGHT? THOSE TWO THINGS ARE DIFFERENT. AND SO IT WAS LIKE LIKE A WHOLE.
03:55:40.533: >> MOTORCYCLES.
03:55:41.401: >> HANDMADE MOTORCYCLES?
03:55:43.069: >> YEAH.  CUSTOM MOTORCYCLES.
03:55:47.874: >> SURE, IF YOU DON'T NEED A MACHINE SHOP.
03:55:57.751: >> COMMISSIONER DISCH.
03:55:58.685: >> SO I'M JUST WONDERING, WOULD IT JUST WORK UNDER CRAFT WORK JEWELRY MAKING AND POTTERY COULD WE JUST SAY JEWELRY MAKING POTTERY, WOOD WORKING?  IT IT MAY NOT BE CRAFT SO MUCH BUT AT LEAST WE GET THE WOODWORKING IN THERE.  AND THE BICYCLE MAKER WILL JUST HAVE TO ASSUME THAT AS LONG AS THEY ARE NOT MASS PRODUCING WE'RE HAPPY WITH IT.
03:56:38.525: >> CRAFT WORK OR OTHER HANDMADE GOODS?
03:56:45.765: >> MMHM.
03:56:47.600: >> WOODWORKING BUSINESSES APPROPRIATE FOR HOMES?
03:56:51.104: >> WOODWORKING?  FOR SURE.
03:56:53.106: >> WOODWORKING, BUT WOODWORKING BUSINESSES.
03:56:55.408: >> NO, NOT WOODWORKING BUSINESSES, BUT WOODWORKING.
03:56:58.745: >> THIS IS ABOUT BUSINESSES. THIS ISN'T ANYBODY MAKING THEMSELVES A TABLE, OR MAKING A TABLE FOR THEIR - -
03:57:08.087: >> NO, NO, RHT, IT'S PEOPLE MAKING THINGS THAT THEY MIGHT BE ON COMMISSION.
03:57:15.595: >> IS THAT, YEAH, SO I THINK - -
03:57:17.897: >> OR CUTTING BOARDS, TO SELL, RIGHT?
03:57:22.101: >> SHELVES. I MEAN, PEOPLE DO THIS.
03:57:23.837: >> YEAH.
03:57:24.170: >> AND I FEEL LIKE ANN ARBOR THERE'S A LOT OF IT. LIKE, THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT OF IT.
03:57:31.511: >> AND CLOTHES. I MEAN, PEOPLE MAKE CLOTHES AND SELL THEM.
03:57:40.153: >> DO YOU, SO WHAT I'M, SO WHAT I'M HEARING IS... I THINK I'M HEARING THAT YOU WANT MORE SPACE AND MORE TYPES OF BUSINESSES TO BE PERMITTED THAN WHAT ARE EXPLICITLY APPROVED NOW.  SPECIFICALLY, MORE MAKER, WHATEVER THAT MAY BE, I JUST DON'T LIKE THAT TERM BECAUSE IT'S AWFULLY BROAD. I THINK WHAT I'M HEARING IS THAT YOU WANT A GREATER LIST OF PERMITTED HOME OCCUPATIONS THAN WHAT WE HAVE HERE?
03:58:23.496: >> AND IF THERE ARE SOME THINGS, I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT FALL INTO THE MAKER CATEGORY THAT CAN, THAT MIGHT NEED TO, THAT YOU MIGHT NOT WANT TO ACTUALLY PUT IN THE EXEMPT CATEGORY. THYIVE PERMITTED. SO THEY HAVE TO LOOK TO THE LIST NUMBER FIVE TO SEE LIKE YOU ARE BEHOLDEN TO THE NOISE REGULATIONS. LIKE, AS AN ADDITIONAL REMINDER; RIGHT? SO I'M NOT, I, LIKE, WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT BEFORE, LIKE, THE PLACE WHERE I THINK YOUR INTENTION WAS THAT THEY WOULD BE COVERED FOR, LIKE, SOME OF THESE SMALL THINGS, WOULD BE UNDER 2B. BUT I'M OKAY WITH IT GOING INTO 3 AS PERMITTED. I DO THINK THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT OF MAKING THAT HAPPENS THAT WE SHOULD ACCOMMODATE, THAT DOESN'T FALL, THAT I DON'T THINK IS ON HERE.
03:59:14.714: >> OKAY, ALL RIGHT. WELL LET ME LOOK AT IT.
03:59:24.657: >> COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL.
03:59:25.892: >> AS LONG AS IT'S NOTUMS-PRODUCED, IT SOME - - NOT MASSES PRODUCED.  IT HAS TO BE CLEAR I'M NOT MAKING THE SAME CABINET OVER AND OVER AGAIN, I'M MAKING A CUSTOM CABINET FOR SOMEBODY. THAT'S AN IMPORTANT DISTINCTION IN TERMS OF JUST THE AMOUNT OF THE SETUP, THE INVENTORY, ALL THAT KIND OF THING I THINK IS REALLY GOING TO BE DIFFERENT FOR SOMEBODY WHO IS, YOU KNOW, GENERATING A THOUSAND CUTTING BOARDS A MONTH VERSUS SOMEBODY WHO'S MAKING THREE A MONTH. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? I DON'T KNOW. IS THAT...
03:59:59.659: >> YEAH, I DON'T - - I THINK SELLING CUTTERING BOARDS YOU'RE GOING TO BE SELLING THE SAME CUTTING BOARD.  I DON'T THINK EVERY CUTTING BOARD'S GOING TO BE A COFFERSAL ONE.  I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A COUPLE OF MODELS AND SELL THEM. BUT I'M HAPPY TO SORT OF THINK ABOUT THIS. THAT'S MY TROUBLE WHEN YOU SAY THAT WHEN YOU ASK ME HOW MANY CUTTING BOARDS CAN I SELL BEFORE I GO FROM ARTISANAL TO MASS PRODUCED.
04:00:27.286: >> RIGHT, RIGHT.
04:00:27.887: >> EVEN IF I SAY YOU CAN'T SELL MORE THAN A HUNDRED, I'M NOT GOING GOING TO KNOW. WE CAN SET THE STANDARD. IF FOR SOME REASON WE FIND OUT.
04:00:40.900: >> CUSTOM CUTTING BOARDS.  I GOT A NICE ONE FOR MY WEDDING. I MEAN, WE, LIKE, PUT OIL ON THAT BABY FOR EVERY WEEK FOR YEARS.
04:00:55.615: >> DO YOU COVER IT.
04:00:57.216: >> YES, ONCE YOU SEASON IT. EVERYONE IS DIFFERENT. SO I WOULD ARGUE THERE ARE CUSTOM CUTTING BOARDS EVEN IF THEERSON MAKES, YOU KNOW, MA, MANY OFHE TOELL AT YOU OW THIISHE SFF THA GETS SOLD AT THE ART FAIR.  I FEEL LIKE THOSE ARE THE KIND OF PEOPLE THAT THEY'RE MAKING, IT'S THEIR BUSINESS. THEY'RE NOT SELLING IT FROM THEIR HOUSE. IT'S THEIR BUSINESS, BUT THEY MAY BE DOING THAT. COMMISSIONER ABRONS.
04:01:22.842: >> I WANT TO PROPOSE THAT INSTEAD OF I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN SUGGEST AN EASY AMENDMENT AND THEN NOT POSTPONE THIS AND HAVE MR. LENER HAVE TO DO MORE WORK ON IT. I WOULD PROPOSE CHANGING 2B AND STRIKING CRAFT WORK AND JUST SAYING HANDMADE GOODS. I THINK THAT INCLUDES, IN MY MIND THAT INCLUDES CUTTING BOARDS, I THINK BIKES ARE AMBIGUOUS BUT THEY COULD THINK OF THEMSELVES IN THAT CATEGORY IF THEY WANTED TO WHICH IS WHAT THEY WOULD WANT TO DO. DOES THAT SEEM TOO PERMISSIVE, MR. LENER?
04:02:04.751: >> DO YOU THINK HANDMADE IS MORE BROAD THAN CRAFT?
04:02:09.288: >> MMHM.
04:02:09.922: >> I DO.
04:02:10.790: >> DO YOU THINK IT HAS ANY LIMITS? THAT IS OF CONCERN?
04:02:18.865: >> I THINK IT LIMITS THINGS THAT ARE MADE BY MACHINE. THERE ARE ARTISAN GOODS THAT ARE MADE WITH MACHINES THAT I THINK WOULDN'T QUALIFY.
04:02:27.373: >> BUT THAT MEANS YOU CAN'T HAVE A TABLE SAW?  YOU'D HAVE TO HAND SAW IT?
04:02:31.110: >> I DON'T KNOW.
04:02:35.615: >> AND ALSO, IF IT INCLUDES METAL, THERE ARE SOME METAL SCULPTURES.
04:02:41.988: >> IT SAYS NO METAL WORK, NO METAL SHOP, NO METAL WORKING OR MACHINE STOP SHOP. I TAKE IT BACK.
04:02:50.797: >> COMMISSIONER CLARKE.
04:02:51.330: >> I WAS JUST GOING TO THROW OUT THERE I THINK THE MAIN DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO WOULD BE WHETHER ONE PERSON DOES THE ENTIRE PROCESS OF THE GOOD VERSUS IF THERE'S A GOOD THAT'S DONE IN STAGES, AND SO BY SAYING HANDMADE YOU'RE IMPLYING THAT ONE PERSON IS DOING THE ENTIRE PRODUCTION PROCESS AND IT'S NOT BEING DONE ON AN ASSEMBLY LINE. I FEEL LIKE THAT COVERS WHAT THE INTENT OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS PRETTY WELL, EVEN BETTER THAN CRAFT I WOULD SAY. JUST WANT TO THROW THAT OUT THERE.
04:03:25.298: >> YOU ALSO HAVE IF IT'S IN SECTION 2B, THE IN RESIDENCE PART TO COVER THIS TOO BUT ANY OF THE ARTISANS, MAKERS, HAVE TO LIVE ON THE PREMISES. SO BEING EXPANSIVE HERE, I FEEL LIKE KEEPS IT TO ONE PERSON. I THINK THAT'S HELPFUL. COMMISSIONER, I THINK COMMISSIONER LEE WAS IT YOUR HAND THAT I SAW?
04:03:53.459: >> YEAH. SO, YOU KNOW, I DEAL WITH USE CLAUSES ALL THE TIME IN COMMERCIAL LEASING AND LANDLORDS TRY TO BE PROHIBITIVE AND SAY I WANT TO BE SPECIFIC.  WE DO WANT TO TO A CERTAIN EXTENT AND I'M TRYING TO SEPARATE ORDINANCE VERSUS OBVIOUSLY USE RESTRICTION CLAUSE BUT I THINK CRAFT WORK TO ME I'LL BE PERFECTLY HONEST, I THINK IT KIND OF COVERS WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. I MEAN CRAFTING SOMETHING TO ME, ADDING JEWELRY MAKING, IF YOU WANT TO ADD TO IT AND INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO CREATE A LIAL BIT OF A LINE, BUT TO TRY AND BROADEN CRAFT, I THINK WE'RE SPLITTING HAIRS.  I WOULD CAUTION I THINK ALMOST AGAINST MAKING IT TOO BROAD. I PERSONALLY FEEL THAT 2B IS I SUPPOSE BROAD ENOUGH FOR US TO SAY. I THINK IT COVERS COFFERSAL IS THE PERSON HAS TO BE THERE. THE PERSON HAS TO RESIDE ON THE PREMISES. I THINK JEWELRY MAKING AND POTTERY IS JUST REALLY KIND OF SPECIFIC SO IT DOESN'T REALLY KIND OF ALLUDE TO IT, BUT I THINK IT'S ARGUABLE, AND REALLY THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS WHEN IT COMES TO IMPACT IF THERE IS SOME KIND OF SOMEBODY HAS AN ISSUE WITH IT. NO ONE'S GOING TO SEE SOMEBODY MAKING I'M NOT GOING TO BE RIDING DOWN THE STREET LOOK AT SOMEBODY MAKING A BIKE INSIDE THEIR GARAGE AND BE LIKE HEY, THAT'S NOT CRAFT. I PERSONALLY FEEL THAT BROADENING IT UP CAN BE A LITTLE BIT OF A SLIPPERY SLOPE.  I'M ALWAYS CAUTIONING AGAINST IT AND THAT THE LIMITATION TO THE PERSON ENGAGING HAS TO RESIDE ON THE PREMISES AND THE FACT THAT CRAFT I THINK IS BROAD ENOUGH ALREADY TO KIND OF HANDLE WHETHER IT'S CUTTING BOARDS, BICYCLES, DINING ROOM TABLES, I THINK THERE'S A FURNITURE YOU CAN'T BE STRIPPING AND DOING ALL KINDS OF THINGS THAT CREATE ODOR. I THINK IF WE GO BACK TO THE CORE PURPOSE OF WHAT ARE WE LOOKING TO DO, WE'RE LOOKING TO ACCOMMODATE THAT TRANSITION OF THAT SECOND TO THE FIRST PLACE AND ALLOW SOME OF THESE USES AND BE SPECIFIC ABOUT IT THAT WE DON'T WANT TO NECESSARILY GO IN THE OTHER DIRECTION AND REALLY OPEN IT UP. MY PREFERENCE WOULD BE TO JUST SIMPLY SAY I THINK CRAFT WORK, I TOTALLY GET IT. ANN ARBOR IS UNIQUE. WE'VE GOT A LOT OF VERY UNIQUELY TALENTED PEOPLE HERE. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THIS REFLECTS THEM. I THINK CRAFT WORK SHOULD BE ENCOMPASSING ENOUGH AND THAT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO - - I WOULD PERSONALLY VOTE ON THIS AND WOULD BE IN FAVOR OF IT AS-IS. SO THAT'S MY TWO CENTS.
04:06:49.335: >> WE LOST MR. LENER.  I WAS GOING TO ASK A FOLLOW-UP QUESTION.  THE QUESTION THAT I HAD IS YOU MENTIONED THAT THIS YEAR HAS POSED A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES. IS IT ON THIS KIND OF THING?  IS IT MAKERS THAT ARE THE PROBLEMS OR IS IT SOME OF THE OTHER - -
04:07:04.050: >> I THINK THAT THE AMBIGUITY AND SOME OF THE RESTRICTIVE POTENTIALLY THE NUMBER OF TRIPS HAS BECOME A BARRIER TO FOLKS THAT HAVE SORT OF BEEN PUSHED INTO HOME OCCUPATIONS OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST YEAR. IN LOOKING AT THOSE I THINK I AGREE WE'RE TOO RESTRICTIVE NOW. I THINK WE WANT TO OPEN UP A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN WHAT WE ARE NOW. SO I DON'T WANT TO SAY THIS HAS BEEN HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE CONTACTING ME LIKE THIS WAS RAISED TO ME AND IT'S COME UP A HANDFUL OF TIMES PROBABLY JUST FROM AN ENFORCEMENT PERSPECTIVE PRE-COVID DOES 10 TRIPS MEAN IF FEDEX COMES I CAN ONLY HAVE FOUR PEOPLE COME? AND I JUST THINK THAT SOME CLARITY AND MOVING THIS A LITTLE BIT MORE OPEN IS A GOOD THING FOR THE CITY.  JUST AND TO JUST BE A LITTLE BIT MORE CLEAR LIKE I THINK THERE'S WE'RE LISTING A LOT MORE OCCUPATIONS HERE THAT SOMEBODY COULD SAY THAT'S WHAT I DO, IT'S DEFINITELY PERMITTED. IT'S NOT GOING TO ADDRESS EVERYTHING AS WE FIND OUT.
04:08:24.130: >> IS CUSTOM MADE GOODS TOO BROAD?
04:08:27.566: >> I THINK IT'S BROAD, BUT YOU KNOW, UM... SO WHAT... I MEAN - -
04:08:37.343: >> I JUST THINK - -
04:08:38.444: >> I THINK CUSTOM MADE GOODS, I MEAN, IF THAT'S THE INTENTION LET'S BE BROAD.
04:08:44.950: >> NO SALES PERMITTED ON THE PREMISES IN MY MIND LIKE.
04:08:51.157: >> THAT'S EVERYTHING.
04:08:53.125: >> IF IT'S ONLY IT'S ONLY INDIVIDUALS THE PEOPLE THAT LIVE THERE CAN BE EMPLOYED BY THAT, IN THAT, AND IT IS EISENHOWER PARTICULAR ITEM NUMBER SETTING YOUR MIND THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SMALL JEWELRY; RIGHT? BY JUST LEAVING OUT THE FOR EXAMPLES, AND THEY'RE STILL GOING TO BE BEHOLDEN TO NOISE AND NEIGHBOR COMPLAINTS., RIGHT?
04:09:19.852: >> YEP.
04:09:20.953: >> SO THAT'S I THINK THAT WOULD BE MY RECOMMENDATION OF CHANGING TO READ CUSTOM MADE GOODS WITH NO SALE SALES PERMITTED ON THE PREMISES. BUT - -
04:09:33.966: >> IN ADDITION REPLACING CRAFT WORK SUCH AS JEWELRY MAKING AND POTTERY OR A THIRD LINE THAT SAYS CUSTOM MADE GOODS?
04:09:46.845: >> MAYBE THE THIRD, MAYBE THAT WOULD BE, THAT COULD BE A THIRD LINE TOO. THAT COULD BE C, MOVE EVERYTHING DOWN.  IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE...
04:10:04.463: >> I THINK MR. LENER YOU THOUGHT THIS WAS SORT OF BASED ON SOME STUFF FROM THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION; RIGHT?
04:10:11.904: >> PUBLICATIONS OF THE 21ST CENTURY MODEL DEVELOPMENT CODE. IT'S WHERE I SORT OF BOTH OF THE STRUCTURE FROM.
04:10:18.177: >> I GOOGLED SOMETHING, I DON'T KNOW WHAT I FOUND THIS WAS FROM 2006 ON THEIR WEBSITE, BUT IT'S ABOUT HOME-BASED BUSINESSES AND IT SAYS HOME CRAFTS THEN UNDER THERE IT'S LIKE INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO JUST MAKING KNITTING, MANUFACTURING OF CRAFTS, DRAWING, PAINTING SCULPTING, I TEND TO AGREE THAT CRAFTS IS BROAD ENOUGH. I'M FINE WITH WHATEVER - - JUST SAID.
04:10:43.068: >> CUSTOM MADE GOODS. THAT TO ME IS THE SAME THING.  I DON'T KNOW THAT I'D PUT IT IN TWICE.  BUT I ALSO THINK THAT, I THINK THE CRAFTS MAYBE IT'S HAVING THE SUCH AS JEWELRY AND POTTERY-MAKING THAT IS MAKING PEOPLE THINK LIKE THIS IS LIKE ARTS AND CRAFT CRAFTS BUT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE. I THINK CRAFT IS BROADER THAN THAT.  BUT MAYBE IT'S JUST THOSE SUCH AS. I'D ALSO BE FINE WITH CHANGING IT TO HOME WHATEVER.
04:11:13.966: >> YOU WERE SUGGESTING JUST CUTTING OUT THE SUCH AS CRAFT WORK, PERIOD.
04:11:19.605: >> YEAH.
04:11:21.607: >> OR ADDING MORE SUCH ASS BUT I THINK THAT'S MAKING IT MORE COMPLICATED.  I THINK THE DEFINITION OF IS THE DEFINITION OF GOOD. I WOULD SAY EITHER OR, I WOULDN'T DO BOTH. OR IF WE KEEP CRAFT I WOULD CUT OUT THE SUCH AS SO PEOPLE DON'T THINK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT —
04:11:38.223: >> I THINK CRAFT WOULD BE VERY INCLUSIVE.  THAT WOULD BE CUTTING BOARD, JEWELRY, YOUR CLOTHING, YOUR MOTORCYCLE, YOUR YOU KNOW, YOUR HOME FURNISHINGS, YOUR CANDLES, YOU NAME IT.
04:11:51.303: >> MMHM. CRAFT IS PRETTY BROAD.
04:11:59.044: >> I THINK SO TOO.
04:12:00.245: >> WERE YOU MOVING TO STRIKE SUCH AS JEWELRYMAKING AND POTTERY?
04:12:03.849: >> SURE, I WILL MOVE TO STRIKE SUCH AS JEWELRY MAKING AND POTTERY.
04:12:10.689: >> SECOND.
04:12:22.334: >> COMMISSIONER?
04:12:22.735: >> DID WE HER?
04:12:24.403: >> OKAY, SO WE HAVE A SECOND?
04:12:26.905: >> THERE WE GO.
04:12:27.306: >> SHE'S PACK.
04:12:27.940: >> HERE, SHE'S BACK.
04:12:32.845: >> MY INTERNET WAS DONE WITH THAT CONVERSATION. CRAFTS. OKAY. THAT'S BROAD.  THAT'S WHAT I, THAT'S WHERE IT FROZE.
04:12:42.221: >> I MADE A MOTION TO STRIKE THE SUCH AS JEWELRY AND.
04:12:48.594: >> I'LL SECOND THAT.
04:12:49.895: >> GREAT. THANK YOU. ANY DISCUSSION OF THE PROPOSED MOTION?  OF THE PROPOSED AMENDMENT? ALL IN FAVOR TO STRIKE THE SUCH AS AND KEEP CRAFTS TO BE VAGUE? GREAT. UM. THE QUESTION I HAVE DOES THIS INCLUDE METAL?  IS THAT A PROBLEM, IS THE NOW A CONFLICT WITH OR THE ARTS INCLUDE METAL? OR DO WE, DO YOU NOT SEE WAY?
04:13:23.462: >> UM. I THINK ULTIMATELY I'M GOING TO, WE ARE GOING TO MAKE A JUDGMENT WHETHER IF YOU ARE, IF YOU ARE BENDING WIRE INTO SCULPTURES IT'S ART. I THINK IF YOU ARE PROBABLY CONSTRUCTING IRON GATES IT'S PROBABLY METAL WORKING. I WOULD SAY THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME LEVEL OF INTERPRETATION OF METAL ORIENTED WORK THAT'SOING TO FALL UER INNSITY IT PROBAY MEAN AK TO MHINE SHOP AND A MORE INTENSIVE WELDING METAL SMITHING TYPE OF ORGANIZATION SO I WOULD SAY THAT'S GOING TO BE AN INTERPRETATION WE HAVE TO MAKE AT THE CITY. AND I THINK THAT'S REASONABLE. THERE'S PROBABLY A MACHINE SHOP LIKE WE PROBABLY DON'T WANT TOOL AND DYE AS PART OF THAT. THAT IS PROBABLY MORE NUISANCE OPPORTUNITIES, MAYBE EVEN ENVIRONMENTAL OPPORTUNITIES, BUT BUILDING BIRD FEEDER HOLDERS IS PROBABLY LES INVASIVE AND MORE OF A CRAFT.  I THINK IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE SOME INTERPRETATION AND I THINK THIS IS STILL A STEP FORWARD.
04:14:46.411: >> OKAY.
04:14:49.114: >> ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS? WE'VE NOW AMENDED THIS TWICE. WE'VE STRUCK SOME WORDS IN 2B, OUR TWO AMENDMENTS WERE JUST STRIKING.
04:15:04.530: >> STRIKING ON NO PREMISES INVENTORY FROM THE ONLINE OR MAIL ORDER SALES, AND STRIKING THE SUCH AS JEWELRY MAKING POTTERY YEAH, SUCH AS JEWELRY MAKING AND POTTERY.
04:15:21.313: >> OKAY. I THINK WE'RE READY TO VOTE THEN.
04:15:33.492: >> COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL.
04:15:40.766: >> THUMBS UP?
04:15:42.935: >> OKAY.
04:15:43.468: >> COMMISSIONER MILLS.
04:15:44.369: >> YES.
04:15:44.970: >> COMMISSIONER SAUVE.

04:15:57.749: >> COMMISSIONER CLARKE.
04:15:58.417: >> YES.
04:16:01.987: >> VERY FRUSTRATING. MOTION CARRIES AS AMENDED.
04:16:05.624: >> OKAY.  IT IS 11:20 P.M. AND SO IF WE TAKE UP ANYTHING ELSE WE NEED TO VOTE ON IT. THE THING THAT'S LEFT IS OUR MEETING SCHEDULE FOR 2021 WHICH DOESN'T TAKE HOLD UNTIL JULY. CAN WE JUST PUT THAT ON THE NEXT WEEK'S MEETING?
04:16:23.075: >> JUST GET IT DONE. I WOULD ASK THAT YOU TAKE IT UP ON THE SCHEDULE - -
04:16:27.946: >> BECAUSE I GUESS WE HAVE TO DO, OKAY. UM, CAN I HAVE A MOTION TO APPROVE THE 2021-2022 PLANNING COMMISSION MEETING SCHEDULE MOVED BY COMMISSIONER SAUVE, SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER LEE. ANY DISCUSSION? WE WILL MEET A LOT OF TUESDAYS EXCEPT WHEN IT'S NOT A TUESDAY.
04:16:48.033: >> AND THOSE FIVE TUESDAYS.
04:16:49.334: >> HOW MANY MONTHS HAVE FIVE TUESDAYS, I NEED TO KNOW.
04:16:53.438: >> USUALLY FOUR.
04:16:54.640: >> SO 52 WEEKS, 48.  YEAH, YEAH.
04:16:57.909: >> DOESN'T THAT FEEL LIKE A VACATION?  IT'S AMAZING?
04:17:01.213: >> YEAH.
04:17:03.582: >> COMMISSIONER LEE.
04:17:04.249: >> ONLY THING IS THAT THE ONE THAT IT SAYS APRIL 15 BUT I THINK WE REVERTED IT BACK TO THE 13TH; RIGHT?  FOR NEXT WEEK?
04:17:15.093: >> THAT'S FOR NEXT YEAR.
04:17:16.294: >> YEAH, SO THIS WAS ORIGINALLY THERE WAS SOMETHING 10A WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT THIS YEAR. NOW 10A WAS CUT BEFORE THE MEETING. SO THE NEW AGENDA IS 10A IS FOR NEXT YEAR.
04:17:29.675: >> WHOOPS. IGNORE MY INQUIRY.
04:17:31.410: >> WE WERE GOING TO CHANGE IT, THE SPOILER ALERT WAS WE WERE GOING TO CHANGE THE MEETING. WE'RE NOT GOING TO CHANGE IT ANYMORE, WE'RE GOING TO STICK TO THE 13TH.
04:17:40.352: >> KAI.
04:17:40.619: >> NEXT WEEK. COMMISSIONER ABRONS.
04:17:42.254: >> I WONDER, SINCE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MEETINGS IF WE KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE CONTINUATION OF REMOTE MEETINGS VERSUS RETURNING TO IN-PERSON MEETING?
04:17:51.663: >> WE DON'T.
04:17:55.634: >> GREAT.
04:17:58.537: >> CITY HALL'S CLOSED TO THE END OF APRIL AT LEAST. I KEEP ASKING, I KEEP SAYING THEY KEEP TELLING ME WE DON'T KNOW. SO.  ARE YOU INTERESTED IN GOING BACK SOONER?
04:18:11.616: >> NO. I'M INTERESTED IN THE POSSIBILITY OF A HYBRID FORMAT IN THE FUTURE.
04:18:17.823: >> LOTS OF - -
04:18:19.591: >> DISCUSSION.
04:18:21.026: >> YEAH LOTS OF INTEREST IN THAT.  WE HAVE SOME TECH ISSUES WE NEED TO RESOLVE, BUT I THINK THERE IS A LOT OF INTEREST IN EXPLORING HOW WE CAN TAKE THE POSITIVE OVER THIS LAST YEAR. ARE NOT ALONE.  I THINK THERE WILL BE A LOT OF EVALUATION OF HOW WE CAN DO THAT.
04:18:36.007: >> OKAY, GREAT.
04:18:36.508: >> I WOULD HOPE AND EXPECT THAT, I MEAN, THAT WHILE THERE IS STILL A PORTION OF THE POPULATION THAT IS NOT VACCINATED THAT, LIKE, EVEN WHEN WE GO BACK THAT THAT HYBRID WOULD BE CONTINUED FOR THOSE OF US, COMMISSIONERS, NOT JUST US BUT AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION TOO? DO YOU THINK THAT'S PART OF THE HYBRID THAT'S BEING CONSIDERED?
04:19:02.000: >> YEAH. I THINK IT'S EVERYTHING.  I MEAN, I THINK IT'S PROVIDING MORE FLEXIBILITY TO COMMISSIONERS, PROVIDING MORE FLEXIBILITY TO THE PUBLIC, THE PETITIONERS, AND POTENTIALLY PROVIDING MORE FLEXIBILITY FOR STAFF. YOU KNOW, IF IT MIGHT BE DIFFERENT FOR ME TO COME INTO A MEETING BUT IF ONE OF MY PLANNERS ONLY HAS TO EBB THERE FOR A FINITE THING AND THE TECHNOLOGY WORKS, ALEXIS MIGHT JUST REMOTE IN FOR THAT ITEM. SO EVERYTHING'S ON THE TABLE TO LOOK AT THAT. I DON'T KNOW WHERE WE'LL END UP. THE ONE THING IS AS YOU NOTICED FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE MEETING, OPEN MEETINGS HAS BEEN SORT OF BROADENED TO PROVIDE MORE FLEXIBILITY FOR THAT.
04:19:40.739: >> THANK YOU.  FLUSH.
04:19:43.375: >> SORRY, I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE QUICK.
04:19:46.077: >> IS THERE ANY OTHER DISCUSSION? CAN WE JUST RAISE OUR HANDS? ALL IN FAVOR OF THE MOTION PLEASE RAISE YOUR HAND OR SAY YES.
04:19:55.453: >> YES.
