00:00:09.699: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE, AND WELCOME TO THE APRIL 13 WORK SESSION OF THE ANN ARBOR CITY COUNCIL, IN WHICH WE DISCUSS A2 ZERO CARBON NEUTRALITY PLAN. DR. STULTS, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
00:00:30.421: >> BEFORE I JUMP IN, I DO WANT TO GIVE MY TEAM A HEADS-UP. I WOULD LIKE THEM JUST TO SAY HI, AND SOME OF THEM ARE HAVING SOME PROBLEMS TODAY WITH WI-FI, SO WE ARE GOING TO COME ON VIDEO ON AND OFF THROUGHOUT. I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW THEY ARE HERE, AND WE'LL START WITH THEA. CAN YOU COME OFF MUTE AND TELL EVERYONE WHO YOU ARE?
00:00:49.273: >> HI, EVERYONE. MY NAME IS THEA. I'M AN ENERGY FELLOW IN THE OFFICE. I HAVE WORKED HERE FOR ABOUT A YEAR.
00:00:56.313: >> GALEN?
00:01:00.050: >> GOOD EVENING, EVERYBODY. I'M GALEN HARDY. I'M THE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT SPECIALIST.
00:01:05.322: >> THANK YOU, GALEN. JOSH?
00:01:08.759: >> JOSH MacDONALD, ENERGY COORDINATOR FOR THE OFFICE --
00:01:14.098: >> AND ZACK?
00:01:16.000: >> HI, EVERYONE. I AM ZACK. I AM ALSO A COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT SPECIALIST.
00:01:21.805: >> EXCELLENT. THANK YOU ALL FOR JOINING US, AND THANKS TO COUNCIL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT THE PLAN IN-DEPTH. I AM GOING TO SHARE MY SCREEN HERE, AND I JUST WANT TO CONFIRM, FOR THOSE THAT I CAN SEE, CAN I SEE A NOD OF HEADS? CAN YOU SEE MY SCREEN? ALL RIGHT. EXCELLENT. SO, WHAT I HOPE TO BE ABLE TO DO FOR OUR TIME TOGETHER IS JUST A FEW REMARKS, HOPEFULLY NO MORE THAN 30 MINUTES AT MOST, TOUCHING ON THE HIGH-LEVEL POINTS OF OUR CARBON NEUTRALITY STRATEGY, AND THEN I WANT TO OPEN IT UP, OBVIOUSLY, FOR QUESTION AND ANSWER. THIS IS AN OVERARCHING, WIDE REACHING PLAN, SO THERE ARE A LOT OF QUESTIONS THAT WE HAVE. I AM GOING TO ASSUME THAT MOST PEOPLE WATCHED THE INITIAL VIDEO, SO I'M NOT GOING TO GO INTO A LOT OF DEPTH ABOUT THINGS IN THE VIDEO THAT WERE REPEATED. I'LL JUST TOUCH ON THE HIGHLIGHTS. WITH THAT SAID, I DO FEEL LIKE I NEED TO SINCERELY THANK THE MANY, MANY PEOPLE WHO MADE THIS PLAN POSSIBLE. THE PLAN, YOU'LL HEAR IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN, IS A LIVING PLAN. IT IS ITERATIVE. WE ARE GOING TO EDIT IT AND CHANGE IT. TECHNOLOGY WILL CHANGE. OUR LANDSCAPE WILL CHANGE, BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE CAME TOGETHER TO PUT TOGETHER THE PLAN THAT YOU SEE BEFORE YOU. SO I VERY MUCH WANT TO THANK THE STAFF WHO SPENT MORE HOURS THAN I CAN CALCULATE WORKING ON THIS. THEY GAVE UP NIGHTS AND WEEKENDS AND REALLY PUT THEIR ALL INTO THIS PLAN. EVERY SERVICE AREA WITHIN THE CITY CONTRIBUTED TO THE PLAN, BUT THERE WERE CERTAIN UNITS THAT STEPPED UP MORE, AND I WANT TO CALL THEM OUT. YOU KNOW WE HAD OVER 80 TECHNICAL ADVISORS. WE HAD OVER 60 PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS. WE WORKED I THINK OUR CALCULATION WAS CLOSE TO ABOUT 15,000 MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WE WORKED WITH IN SOME WAY, SHAPE OR FORM, AND WE PULLED PRETTY HEAVILY FROM PEER COMMUNITIES, BOTH DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL, AND I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEM, AND I WOULD BE 100% REMISS IF I DIDN'T ACKNOWLEDGE THE LEADERSHIP IN EXPLORING THE PLATFORM AND WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO ACHIEVE 100% CARBON NEUTRALITY. ON NOVEMBER 4TH, YOU DECLARED A CLIMATE EMERGENCY AND DIRECTED THE CITY TO BEGIN LOOKING IN EARNEST AT WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO ACHIEVE CARBON NEUTRALITY BY 2030. SO, A2 ZERO IS HOW WE TALK ABOUT IT. IT'S HOW WE TALK ABOUT THE PLANNING PROCESS. IT'S HOW WE TALK ABOUT THE PLAN ITSELF, AND IT'S HOW WE ARE BRANDING THE INITIATIVES THAT COME OUT OF THE PROCESS, JUST TO MAKE IT A LOT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND HOW ALL OF THESE THINGS FIT TOGETHER, BECAUSE, AS YOU KNOW, THERE'S A LOT THAT FALLS UNDER -- SO THE CHARGE FOR CARBON NEUTRALITY, AGAIN, JUST AS A REMINDER, WE DO GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS INVENTORIES. OUR INVENTORY BASELINE FROM 2018 IS WHAT WE ARE WORKING FROM, WITH A BASELINE OF 2.1 MILLION METRIC TONS OF CARBON DIOXIDE EQUIVALENT. WE HAVE ACHIEVED ABOUT A 14% COMMUNITY WIDE REDUCTION IN GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS, AND THE GOAL, OF COURSE, IS ZERO, AND TO GET THERE, THAT MEANS THE DOWNWARD TREND CHART HAS TO RAPIDLY DROP. WE ARE WORKING ON FINISHING 2019 AND ARE MOVING TOWARDS AN ANNUAL INVENTORY TO TRACK, BUT THIS GIVES A SENSE OF WHERE EMISSIONS COME FROM, BOTH BY SECTOR AND SOURCE. IT LET US KNOW WHERE TO TARGET. KNOWING 52% COMES FROM ELECTRICITY TELLS US A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR SOLUTIONS HAVE TO FOCUS ON ELECTRICITY. SIMILARLY, NATURAL GAS, 28% LET US KNOW HOW TO FOCUS ON THAT SECTOR. UNDERSTANDING THE SOURCES OF THE EMISSION, RESIDENTIAL VERSUS COMMERCIAL, HELPED US ROUND OUT STRATEGIES IN TERMS OF COLLABORATION, THE KINDS OF ACTIVITIES THAT WE ARE PROPOSING TO UNDERTAKE LOOK DIFFERENT DEPENDING ON WHETHER YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A RENTAL UNIT, SINGLE-FAMILY HOME, OR WHETHER YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AN ACADEMIC INSTITUTION. JUST A REMINDER, THE WAY THAT WE DO INVENTORIES IS STANDARDIZED. SO THE WAY ANN ARBOR DOES AN INVENTORY IS THE EXACT WAY NEW YORK CITY OR COPENHAGEN OR LONDON OR BRISBANE IS DOING THEIR INVENTORY, AND THAT'S TO MAKE SURE THAT WE COUNT THINGS THE SAME WAY AND DON'T DOUBLE COUNT WHAT'S IN THE SYSTEM. WE FOLLOW WHAT'S CALLED SCOPES. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THERE. I DO WANT TO REITERATE WHAT'S NOT INCLUDED IN THE INVENTORY, BECAUSE THIS IS IMPORTANT. ALL OF US ARE SITTING IN BUILDINGS RIGHT NOW. I'M SURROUNDED BY WOOD. THERE'S PROBABLY SOME STEEL IN THIS HOME THAT I AM IN, AND THERE ARE EMBEDDED EMISSIONS THAT ARE IN THIS BUILDING. THOSE AREN'T CALCULATED IN OUR INVENTORY, NOR ARE THE UPSTREAM EMISSIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRODUCTION OF THINGS LIKE THIS WATER BOTTLE. THERE'S A LOT OF ENERGY THAT WENT INTO PRODUCING THIS. THERE WAS EXTRACTION OF MATERIALS. WE DON'T HAVE THAT FOR THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY, AND YOU CAN PROBABLY UNDERSTAND HOW THAT WOULD BE VERY TRICKY. OUR UNIT WOULD HAVE TO UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING EVERYONE EVER PURCHASED, WHERE THEY PURCHASED IT FROM, HOW IT GOT TO THEM, WHAT THEY DID WITH IT WHEN THEY WERE DONE WITH IT, WHETHER IT WENT INTO CIRCULATION, WHETHER IT WAS BROKEN DOWN INTO TURNED INTO ANOTHER FORM OF MATERIAL, ET CETERA.  THERE ARE IMPORTANT EMISSIONS BEING OMITTED BY NOT CAPTURING THOSE, BUT RIGHT NOW THERE ISN'T A STANDARD PROTOCOL FOR HOW LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CAPTURE THOSE EMISSIONS FROM THE COMMUNITY. OUR MISSION IS TO CONTINUE TO DEVELOP THAT PROTOCOL, WORKING WITH PEERS, SO WE CAN CAPTURE THOSE EMISSIONS, BUT RIGHT NOW WE FELT IT WAS INSINCERE TO CAPTURE THINGS THAT WE DO UPSTREAM AND COUNT THOSE TOWARDS A REDUCTION THAT ISN'T IN OUR BASELINE INVENTORY. THIS IS ONE YOU'LL SEE AN UPDATE FOR IN THE NEAR FUTURE. WE ARE WORKING TO CHANGE THIS. WE HAVE A LOT OF FOLKS WHO COMMUTE IN DURING A TRADITIONAL DAY, PRE-COVID-19, AND WE ONLY PICK UP THEIR COMMUTE WHEN THEY HIT THE BOUNDARY OF THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR, BUT WE UNDERSTAND WE ARE AN ATTRACTER. PEOPLE COME HERE TO WORK, TO STUDY, TO RECREATE, AND WE WANT TO UNDERSTAND THE FULL RANGE OF COMMUTES AND IMPACTS, AND SO WE ARE WORKING RIGHT NOW ON CHANGING THAT METHODOLOGY. RIGHT NOW, WE DON'T CAPTURE AGRICULTURE, PRIMARILY BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE IT IN OUR REGION, AND THE FORESTRY WE DO CAPTURE IS PRIMARILY THE TREES WE ARE PLANTING. JUST A REMINDER, THE MISSION OF A2 ZERO, IN THE PREVIOUS PRESENTATION, WE WENT INTO FURTHER DEPTH, BUT THE MISSION IS THIS CITY'S MISSION, VERBATIM. THE VISION IS TOGETHER WE ARE CREATING AND IMPLEMENTING A JUST TRANSITION TO CARBON NEUTRALITY BY THE YEAR 2030, AND YOU CAN SEE AN IMAGE. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH A GRAPHIC ARTIST TO DO SOME R RENDERINGS AS THE PLANS WERE EVOLVING. MANY OF THE THINGS IN THE PLAN ARE HARD TO CONCEPTUALIZE, ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE LIKE ME, A VISUAL LEARNER. I ONLY HAVE TWO SLIDES LEFT TO TALK ABOUT THE PROCESS, JUST TO REITERATE IT. THERE'S A LOT ON HERE. AS A REMINDER, THE PROCESS REALLY KIND OF FOLLOWED A FUNNELED APPROACH. THERE WERE THREE PHASES, THE FIRST PHASE BEING THE OPENING OF THE FUNNEL, THE IDEATION PHASE, WHERE WE TOOK IN INPUT FROM THE PUBLIC, TECHNICAL ADVISORS, FROM THE DRAWDOWN FROM SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE, PEER CITY INTERVIEWS THAT WE DID, AND IT ALL WENT INTO THE MIX IN CONSIDERATION FOR WHAT COULD BE A PART OF THE CARBON NEUTRALITY STRATEGY. IN THE SECOND FUNNEL, WE STARTED PRIORITIZATION, SO HERE WE HAD A MATRIX, A CRITERION FOR EVERYTHING FROM MULTIPLE CRITERION AROUND EQUITY AND MAKING SURE TO IDENTIFY WHICH STRATEGIES PRIORITIZE FRONTLINE POPULATIONS. WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT IDENTIFYING THE COBENEFITS OF STRATEGIES, WHICH THINGS WERE TECHNICALLY POSSIBLE. SOME NEW IDEAS SOUNDED GREAT, BUT THE TECHNOLOGY WASN'T READILY AVAILABLE YET, SO WE WANTED TO UNDERSTAND A RANGE OF FEASIBILITY CRITERION, SO WE RAN THROUGH A PRIORITIZATION PROCESS USING CRITERION, AND THEN WE RAN THROUGH AN EXPERT ELICITATION PROCESS, AND WHAT THAT LOOKED LIKE WAS A DIFFERENT FORM OF PRIORITIZATION. IT'S WHERE WE ASKED EXPERTS IN THEIR INDIVIDUAL FIELDS NOT TO RANK THINGS BASED ON ALL OF THOSE CRITERIA, BUT TO SAY IF YOU COULD ONLY PICK TEN ACTIONS, FOCUSED ON, LET'S SAY, RESILIENCE, WHICH TEN HAVE TO BE IN THIS STRATEGY? AND SO WE USED THEIR EXPERTISE THAT THEY BROUGHT TO BEAR TO REALLY REFINE THE KINDS OF ACTIONS FOR PRIORITIZATION. AND THEN THE THIRD PHASE FOCUSED ON HOW WE WERE GOING TO ACHIEVE THIS. I THINK YOU HAVE HEARD ME SAY THIS, AND I THINK I SAID THIS IN THE PREVIOUS VIDEO, WE THOUGHT THE THIRD PHASE WOULD FOCUS ON WHAT WENT INTO THE PLAN, AND THAT'S THE WAY WE HAD LAID OUT THE PROCESS THE ENTIRE TIME, BUT THE TRUTH WAS, WHEN WE GOT TO THE END OF PHASE 2 AND WE DID THE CALCULATIONS, THE ANSWER WAS EVERYTHING FELL INTO THE PLAN, AND OFFSETS WERE STILL ON THE TABLE. AND SO WE CHANGED THE PROCESS. WE HAD A STAFF MEETING, AND WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME REALLY STRUGGLING WITH WHETHER OR NOT TO GO OUT AND HAVE A PUBLIC VOTE ON THE FINAL ACTIONS, AND WE FELT LIKE IT WAS INSINCERE OR DISINGENUOUS IF THE ACTION WAS IT TOOK IT ALL. SO, INSTEAD, WE MADE THE DECISION TO PIVOT AND START ASKING FOR HELP ABOUT HOW WE WOULD ACHIEVE THESE ACTIONS, FOR WHICH WE GOT REALLY GREAT FEEDBACK. ON THE LEFT, YOU CAN SEE WE HAD 82 WORKING DAYS TO ACHIEVE THIS. WE WORKED MORE THAN 82 WORKING DAYS. WE WORKED WEEKENDS ON THIS, OF COURSE, AND GALEN PROBABLY PULLED THE MOST WEEKENDS OF ANYONE ON THE TEAM. WE RAN THREE PUBLIC SURVEYS, WITH THE LAST ONE HAVING ABOUT A THOUSAND RESPONDENTS. WE HAD 68 PUBLIC EVENTS. WE HAD 80 SCHEDULED WITH 12 CANCELLED DUE TO COVID-19. WE HAD TOWN HALLS WITH EXPERTS IN THEIR FIELD, FOCUSED ON ENERGY, MOBILITY, RESOURCE REDUCTION, AND HAD HELP CRAFTING THE STRATEGY, AND WE HAD 66 PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS, SOME OF WHICH AGREED TO WORK WITH US AND ARE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH US. THE LAST PART OF THE PROCESS, IT WAS ITERATIVE AND IT STILL REMAINS ITERATIVE. WHAT I MEAN BY THAT, WE DIDN'T TAKE THE IDEAS FROM THE TECHNICAL ADVISORS NOR THE PUBLIC AND JUST RUN WITH THEM; WE TOOK ALL OF THOSE THINGS, AND THEY WERE CONSTANTLY IN CONVERSATION WITH EACH OTHER. FOR EXAMPLE, STRATEGIES MIGHT HAVE COME OUT OF OUR FIRST ROUND OF PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT AND OUR FIRST ENGAGEMENT WITH TECHNICAL ADVISORS THAT WE DID EXPLICITLY PUT IN OUR FIRST SURVEY, AND THEN IT STARTED TO CONDENSE AS WE SAW WHAT WAS TECHNICALLY POSSIBLE AND WHAT WAS SOCIALLY FEASIBLE, AND THOSE TWO THINGS HAD TO COME TO A HEAD, AND THAT HAPPENED AND CONTINUES, CANDIDLY, TO HAPPEN THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS, SO THIS IS ALL VERY ITERATIVE AND LIVING. SO THE STRATEGY, AS JUST A QUICK REFRESHER, THERE WERE SEVEN OVERARCHING STRATEGIES AND 44 ACTIONS THAT MAKE UP THE A2 ZERO PLAN. THE SEVEN STRATEGIES ARE POWERING THE ELECTRIC GRID WITH CLEAN RENEWABLE ENERGY, AND SECOND SWITCHING OVER TO ELECTRIC FROM DIESEL, GAS, ET CETERA, AND THE RATIONALE IS AS WE ARE MAKING THE GRID CLEAN, WE ARE MOVING THEM TO 100% RENEWABLE BY MAKING THAT SWITCH. THE THIRD IS IMPROVING THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY IN PRETTY MUCH EVERY ASPECT OF OUR LIFE, SO THE HOME THAT YOU'RE SITTING IN, IN PLACES OF WORSHIP OR RECREATIONAL FACILITIES. THE FOURTH IS REDUCING THE AMOUNT WE TRAVEL BY 50%. THIS IS SIGNIFICANT. TRANSPORTATION, FOR US, WE ARE ANOMALOUS TO THE MAJORITY OF THE COUNTRY. IN MOST PLACES, TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS ARE THE LARGEST SOURCES OF EMISSIONS. WE ARE PRETTY BLESSED TO HAVE A FAIRLY ROBUST AND DENSE COMMUNITY WHERE TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS HAVE ONLY SLOWLY BEEN INCREASING, BUT, OF COURSE, AS WE CLOSE THE GAP IN OTHER AREAS, AS WE FIGURE OUT HOW TO TRANSITION THE ELECTRICAL GRID, WHAT WILL REMAIN IS THE TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS THAT WILL GROW TO A LARGER PERJURE AS WE GREEN THE GRID ITSELF. THE FIFTH FOCUSES ON THE WAY WE USE MATERIALS, THE WAY WE USE THINGS, HOW WE REUSE OR DON'T REUSE THINGS, HOW WE DISPOSE OF MATERIALS, AND IT'S EFFECTIVELY MOVING US TOWARDS SOMETHING THAT I THINK WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE IN DIFFERENT PLANNING PROCESSES, WHICH IS A CIRCULAR ECONOMY, WHERE WE ARE MINIMIZING WASTE, THAT WHAT WE MIGHT HAVE TRADITIONALLY CONSIDERED AS WASTE IS ACTUALLY PUT TO A REALLY BENEFICIAL USE SOMEWHERE ELSE IN THE SYSTEM. THIS IS LOW-TECH HIGH-TECH STRATEGIES, AND I KNOW YOU HAVE HEARD QUITE A BIT ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT HERE. THE SIXTH IS ALL OF THESE ARE VERY NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART, BUT THIS IS ONE THAT I HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING WITH A LOT OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS, WHICH IS ENHANCING THE RESILIENCE OF PEOPLE. DESPITE ALL OF OUR EFFORTS, CLIMATE CHANGE IS ALREADY HERE, WE ARE FEELING THE IMPACTS OF IT, AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR COMMUNITY IS READY TO NOT JUST SURVIVE BUT TO THRIVE IN WHAT IS COMING DOWN THE PIKE, AND THE VALUE OF RESILIENCE I'M GOING TO TALK A BIT ABOUT AT THE VERY END, BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS THE VERY NATURAL LAUNCH POINT FOR A LOT OF OUR WORK, GIVEN THE EXACT MOMENT IN TIME THAT WE ARE SITTING IN WITH THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. AND I SORT OF TEASE THAT WE CHEAT AND THROW THE OTHERS IN, LIKE MOST PLANS DO. IF YOU HAVE SEEN IT, THERE ARE FOUR STRATEGIES HERE. THREE ARE FOUNDATIONAL STRATEGIES, AND THE LAST IS CARBON OFFSETS TO CLOSE THE GAP. BECAUSE EVEN DOING ALL OF THE ABOVE WITH THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE HAVE BUILT INTO THE PLAN, WE DO STILL HAVE TO INVEST IN CARBON OFFSETS. I KNOW YOU HAVE SEEN THAT. WHAT I WANTED TO SHOW YOU IS SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVEN'T SEEN. WE ARE WORKING ON THE PLAN LAYOUT. YOU HAVE SEEN IT IN A WORD DOCUMENT, AND IT IS FINE, BUT IT IS CLUNKY. SO WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON A DESIGN, AND THIS IS WHAT IT IS GOING TO EVENTUALLY LOOK LIKE WITH SOME MODEST REFINEMENTS. SO, IT'LL TAKE ALL OF THE CONTENT THAT YOU'VE SEEN AND JUST TRY TO MAKE IT A LITTLE BIT MORE AESTHETICALLY PLEASING. OVER HERE IN THIS COMING SOON BOX, WHAT WE ARE DOING IS MODELING THE EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL STRATEGY OVER TIME. THIS IS JUST ONE STRATEGY, AND IN THIS CASE, IT IS THE COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATION, JUST BECAUSE IT IS THE 1st OF THE 44 THAT WE LIST, AND WHAT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SEE IS IT SHOW WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR IMPLEMENTATION, WHO THE PARTNERS ARE, ANY ASSUMPTIONS, BECAUSE, OF COURSE, THERE ARE ASSUMPTIONS BUILT IN, AND SO WE TRIED TO BE AS TRANSPARENT AS POSSIBLE WITH WHAT WE ASSUMED IN TERMS OF PUBLIC UPTICK OR ENGAGEMENT IN A GIVEN ACTIVITY, AND THEN WE HAVE A BOX CALLING OUT ANY SPECIFIC EQUITY IMPACTS, EITHER POSITIVELY OR NEGATIVELY WITH THE ACTION THAT WE ARE MONITORING. AND THEN THE INDICATORS OF SUCCESS OR GOALS THAT WE ARE GOING TO TRACK. THIS IS THE TIMELINE OF SPECIFIC ACTIONS OR MILESTONES THAT WE'LL BE ENGAGING FOR EACH OF THE ACTIVITIES. SOME ARE MUCH MORE DETAILED THAN OTHERS. SOME COME ONLINE VERY FAST, SO IT'S A SHORT TIMELINE. IT LOOKS DIFFERENT DEPENDING ON THE STRATEGY. YOU CAN SEE THE COST OVER TEN YEARS AND THE REDUCTION IN POTENTIAL OVER TEN YEARS. SO WHAT WE ARE PROPOSING TO MODEL HERE, WE HAVE THE GRAPHICS AND WE JUST HAVE TO PUT THEM IN THE DESIGN, IS THE REDUCTION POTENTIAL YEAR OVER YEAR. THIS IS NEW. THIS IS JUST A DIFFERENT WAY TO THINK ABOUT THE PLAN. WE SHOWED YOU THE PLAN BROKEN DOWN BY THOSE DIFFERENT STRATEGIES, WHICH IS ONE CONCEPTUAL WAY TO THINK ABOUT IT. IT'S HOW WE THOUGHT ABOUT IT. BUT ANOTHER WAY TO THINK ABOUT IT IS OUR ABILITY TO INFLUENCE IT. SO, AS A LOCAL GOVERNMENT, WE CAN DO THINGS DIRECTLY AS AN ACTOR, THINGS WHERE WE DON'T REALLY NEED MUCH SUPPORT. I MEAN, WE NEED PUBLIC SUPPORT, BUT WE HAVE THE AUTHORITY AND THE AUTONOMY TO DO THAT. THERE ARE THINGS THAT WE CAN REGULATE, AND THEN THERE ARE THINGS THAT WE CAN INFLUENCE. SO, WHAT WE DID IS I TOOK THESE THREE BUCKETS, AND I TOOK ALL OF THE 44 ACTIONS, AND I PUT THEM IN THESE BUCKETS. SO THIS IS A DIFFERENT CONCEPTUAL WAY TO UNDERSTAND, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PLAN, FOR EXAMPLE, SOME THINGS TAKE TIME. SO, THINGS WHERE WE ARE AN INFLUENCER BUT WE DON'T HAVE DIRECT CONTROL, WE MODELED THOSE HAPPENING LATER IN OUR TIMELINE, BECAUSE WE NEED TO USE OUR INFLUENCE TO TRY TO GET, FOR EXAMPLE, POLICY CHANGE. THINGS HERE, WHERE WE ARE A DIRECT ACTOR, WE CAN MOVE ON ON OUR OWN, SO THESE TEND TO BE QUICKER STRATEGIES, BECAUSE WE CAN START THEM. SO YOU CAN JUST SEE A LIST HERE OF THE STRATEGIES, AND I'M HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT ANY OF THESE OFFLINE. THESE ARE THE ONES THAT WE IDENTIFIED AS A REGULATOR THAT WE HAVE SOME ABILITY OVER. WE WANT TO NOTE, SOME OF THEM KIND OF STRADDLE BOTH SPACES. SO, AS A REGULATOR, SHOULD WE HAVE THE ABILITY, SHOULD THE STATE PASS MORE UPDATED BUILDING CODES, THEN WE CAN REGULATE THEM, BUT WE ARE ALSO AN INFLUENCER, BECAUSE, AS YOU ALL KNOW, WE CAN'T SET MORE AGGRESSIVE BUILDING CODES WITHOUT THE STATE PASSING MORE AGGRESSIVE BUILDING CODES. SO THIS KIND OF STRADDLES IN BOTH. AND THEN THE LAST, BY FAR THE LARGEST, IS WHERE WE ARE AN INFLUENCER. SO WE ARE GOING TO NEED TO WORK WITH OTHER PARTNERS TO MAKE THESE THINGS HAPPEN, AND THAT IS PART OF THE REASON WE HAVE 66 PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS THAT WE ARE WORKING WITH, BECAUSE WE KNOW WE NEED TO BE COLLABORATING WITH THEM. AND IT RANGES FROM BIG STRATEGIES TO STRATEGIES THAT HAVE MUCH MORE EDUCATIONAL VALUE, AND THAT'S STILL INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT IN OUR WORK, SO YOU CAN KIND OF SEE THE SPREAD. I AM NOT SURE IF THIS WAS HELPFUL, BUT THIS WAS JUST ANOTHER WAY WE THOUGHT MIGHT BE USEFUL TO THINK ABOUT THE ACTIONS THAT ARE BEING PRESENTED IN THE PLAN. THIS IS A SUMMARY. WE TRIED TO PRESENT IT IN ANOTHER WAY TO SHOW YOU WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. SO THIS IS A SUMMARY OF THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS MODELED YEAR OVER YEAR. SO WHAT YOU'LL SEE IN 2020, IS WHERE WE ARE NOW, THERE'S A MODEST REDUCTION POTENTIAL, AND THEN IT SCALES UP OVER TIME. AND THE BIG JUMP, THIS IS THE INVERSE, IF YOU SAW THE GRAPHIC THAT LOOKS LIKE A PIE CHART, AND THEN YOU HAD THIS STEEP DROP-OFF, BASICALLY WHAT'S HAPPENING BETWEEN 2026 AND 2027 IS THIS IS BASICALLY WHERE WE ARE ABLE TO GO TO MARKET AND BUY RENEWABLE ENERGY FOR ALL OF THE CONSTITUENTS THAT HAVE NOT OPTED OUT OF THAT PROGRAM, AND IN OUR MODELING WE ASSUME THAT WE ARE BUYING 100% GREEN AND RENEWABLE ENERGY, NEW ENERGY BEING PUT ON THE GRID, AND THAT THE ENERGY IS DISPLACING FOSSIL FUELS, AND WE ADDED A PREMIUM SO THAT WE ARE INVESTING IN A COMMUNITY WITHIN A COMMUNITY THAT HAS BEEN DISPROPORTIONATELY BURNED HISTORICALLY BY THE FOSSIL FUEL OR EXTRACTED ECONOMY. THAT'S WHY YOU SEE THAT STARK JUMP, BUT WE MODEL NOT ONLY THAT IT COMES ONLINE BY THAT DATE, BUT THAT WE START WORKING ON IT ALMOST IMMEDIATELY, BECAUSE WE KNOW IT'S GOING TO TAKE TIME TO GET SOMETHING LIKE THAT THROUGH IN TERMS OF STATE LEGISLATIVE CHANGE, BECAUSE IT NEEDS TO BE ENABLED AT THE STATE LEVEL. I DO WANT TO PUT IN ONE CAVEAT THAT OUR MODELING, AND YOU PROBABLY HAVE SEEN THIS IN THE OTHER SLIDES, WE PUT IN AN ASTERISK THAT SAID ASSUMING THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN PARTICIPATES. THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, I THINK YOU ALL KNOW, IS GOING THROUGH ITS OWN CARBON NEUTRALITY PLANNING PROCESS, AND I SIT ON THE COMMISSION, AND SO I GET TO WORK WITH THEM ON THIS. A GOAL HAS NOT YET BEEN ESTABLISHED, NOR HAS THEIR PLAN BEEN RELEASED, SO OUR MODEL IS BUT A MODEL. IT IS AN ASSUMPTION. AND WHAT WE TOOK AS OUR CHARGE FROM COUNCIL IS THE QUESTION, WHAT IS IT GOING TO TAKE TO ACHIEVE CARBON NEUTRALITY? THAT'S WHAT WE MODELED AND WORKED ON TIRELESSLY OVER 82 DAYS. THE UNIVERSITY'S PROJECTION, YOU CAN SEE A DROP-OFF IS GOING TO HAPPEN IN 2021, BECAUSE THEY HAVE SIGNED OFF ON A LARGER RENEWABLE ENERGY PURCHASE WITH DTE. SO THEY ARE MODELING OFFSETS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT, AND THEY ARE GOING TO BE MAKING EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTS AT THEIR NATURAL GAS PLANT. THESE ARE THE MODELED CHANGES. THEY HAVEN'T COMMITTED TO THE PLAN YET. I WANTED TO SHOW THIS, IN AUTHENTICITY, AND ALSO BECAUSE WE ARE PARTNERING WITH THE UNIVERSITY, TO SAY WE MODELED THEM ENGAGING WITH US IN OUR INITIATIVES, BUT IT'S VERY POSSIBLE THAT WE'LL BE EDITING THE PLAN ONCE THEIR PLAN IS FINISHED TO INTEGRATE THEIR STRATEGIES IN. THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE TO WORK FROM IN TERMS OF WHAT THE UNIVERSITY HAS COMMITTED TO US AT THIS POINT IN TIME. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS, BECAUSE I AM SURE THAT IS CONFUSING, BUT I AM SOMEWHAT LIMITED IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH I CAN ANSWER ABOUT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN'S FUTURE, BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE A PLAN ESTABLISHED. THIS IS THE COST PER STRATEGY OVER A 10-YEAR TIME PERIOD. THE COSTS ASSUME THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS, WHICH IS VERY MUCH WHY NUMBER FOUR IS THE LARGEST. IT HAS, BY FAR, THE LARGEST PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS, WHICH I KNOW IS A BIG NUMBER AND IT IS HARD TO SWALLOW, BE -- BUT IT ALSO CONCEPTUALLY MAKES SENSE, WITH SOMETHING LIKE NEW BUS LANES, THAT IS CAPITAL INTENSIVE. WE ALSO MODELED SOCIAL CAPITAL COSTS FOR THE PHYSICAL BEINGS IT TAKES TO DO THE WORK, AND SOMETIMES THERE WERE ALSO SOFT COSTS MODELED INTO THE PROJECTIONS AS WELL. THIS IS THE COST PER YEAR WITH 2025 BEING THE PEAK, BECAUSE IT'S THE YEAR THAT WE ANTICIPATE DOING A MAJOR BUILD-OUT OF THE BUS RAPID TRANSIT SYSTEM, IF WE MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION. WE MODELED THE STAFFING. THIS QUESTION CAME UP A FEW TIMES. HERE, STAFFING MOVES UP AND DOWN BECAUSE IT DEPENDS ON WHAT WE PROJECT IT TO DO IN ANY GIVEN YEAR. SO THE BASIC STAFFING MODEL, IF YOU LOOK ACROSS THIS, IS BASICALLY AT 15.75 IS THE LOWEST LEVEL, AND THAT'S AS HIGH AS I THINK WE WOULD GO, IF WE WERE TO GO THAT HIGH, WITH THE REST BEING THROUGH TEMPORARY LABOR CONTRACTORS, ET CETERA, SO WE HAVE A STABLE SET OF FOLKS IN THE OFFICE, AND THEN THE REST KIND OF EBB AND FLOW AS WE ARE WORKING ON SOMETHING, WHATEVER IT IS THAT WE ARE WORKING ON IN THE PROCESS. AND I CAN TELL YOU EXACTLY WHAT IT IS, IF PEOPLE HAVE QUESTIONS. THIS IS A REMINDER, IN TERMS OF THE BUDGET REQUEST. VERY SINCERELY, WE KNOW WE ARE IN THE SECOND YEAR OF A BUDGET. THE WORLD LOOKS DIFFERENT FOR ALL OF US THAN MONTHS AGO, AND SO WHAT WE TRIED TO DO WAS BE REALLY HONEST ABOUT WHAT WE WOULD NEED TO DO TO FREE UP TIME FOR THINGS LIKE AGGRESSIVE FUND-RAISING. THESE ARE THE ASKS THAT WE HAD. OBVIOUSLY, WE WERE THE LAST TO GO IN THE BUDGET WORK SESSION PROCESS, AND NOW WE ARE EVEN LATER IN THAT PROCESS. SO I KNOW THIS GETS COMPLICATED AND TRICKY, BUT I DID WANT TO TRANSPARENTLY PUT IT ON THE SLIDE OF WHAT WE ASKED FOR. THE LAST TWO SLIDES ARE NEW SLIDES THAT I JUST WANT TO PUT UP. THIS IS A LITTLE HARD TO READ. I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT. THIS IS IN ADDITION TO THE PLAN WHERE WE HAD KIND OF A COMING SOON BOX TALKING ABOUT THE CO-BENEFITS OF THE STRATEGIES. BUT THESE ARE NOW IN THE UPDATED PLAN GETTING DESIGNED, AND THERE ARE THINGS WE ALL KNOW, THAT IN CLIMATE ACTION, IN SOME WAYS, IT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER IF YOU'RE MOTIVATED BY CLIMATE ACTION. WE ARE AS A BODY. THAT'S WHY WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE PLAN. THE BEAUTY IS THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT, IF YOU'RE REALLY MOTIVATED BY EQUITY AND JUSTICE, THERE ARE SO MANY OPPORTUNITIES TO DO THAT IN THIS PLAN BECAUSE EQUITY AND JUSTICE IS FRONT AND CENTER IN THIS WORK. AND IF YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT MOBILE JOB CREATION, WHICH I THINK WE PROBABLY ALL ARE RIGHT NOW, I CAN TELL YOU WE NEED TO BE INVESTING IN THE WORKFORCE TO BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT THESE STRATEGIES, BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH WORKERS LOCALLY RIGHT NOW TO DO THIS, SO HOW ARE WE GOING TO PARTNER WITH OTHERS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE GETTING THE TRAINING NEEDED TO COME INTO THIS MARKETPLACE? BECAUSE WORK FOR THEM, IF WE ARE GOING TO IMPLEMENT THIS PLAN. SO THESE ARE TEN CO-BENEFITS THAT ARE THE MOST DOMINANT CO-BENEFITS THAT WE SEE, AND WHAT WE HAVE DONE FOR EACH ACTION IS INCLUDED A LIST OF CO-BENEFITS THAT YOU CAN SEE. WE DID NOT QUANTIFY THEM IN THE SAME WAY THAT WE DID GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION QUANTIFICATIONS, IN SOME WAYS BECAUSE IT IS JUST NOT AS EASY TO DO THAT FOR CO-BENEFITS OR BECAUSE THERE ISN'T A STANDARD FOR HOW WE CAPTURE THE DOLLARS ASSOCIATED WITH -- RIGHT NOW, IT JUST IDENTIFIES IN THE PLAN, THE UPDATED VERSION, THE CO-BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH EACH OTHER STRATEGY. THIS IS A LOT, BUT I WANTED TO PUT THIS ON, BECAUSE I HAD BEEN THINKING A LOT ABOUT THIS LATELY, AND I KNOW WE HAVE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC JOINING US TOO. IS THAT WHEN WE WENT THROUGH AND INITIATED THIS PLANNING PROCESS, ON NOVEMBER 4TH, WHEN YOU PASSED THE CLIMATE EMERGENCY DECLARATION, AS GIFTED AS WE ALL ARE, NONE OF US SAW THE FUTURE. WE DIDN'T SEE THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, AND WE ARE NOW IN THAT PANDEMIC, AND WE ARE LIVING THROUGH AND SEEING LAID BEAR THE VULNERABILITIES IN OUR SYSTEM, THE DISPARITIES IN OUR SYSTEM, WHETHER THAT'S FROM A HEALTH PERSPECTIVE OR ACCESS TO RESOURCE PERSPECTIVE. WE SEE AND WE HEAR ABOUT THEM EVERY DAY, AND I HAVE BEEN THINKING A LOT ABOUT THE ROLE OF RESILIENCE IN THIS CONVERSATION. AND I THINK I HAVE SHARED WITH YOU BEFORE, WE THINK ABOUT RESILIENCE AS THE INTERSECTION BETWEEN HOW WE ADAPT AND PREPARE FOR THE THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING, HOW WE MITIGATE, IN PARTICULAR CLIMATE IMPACTS, AND HOW WE GROUND ALL OF OUR WORK IN EQUITY. AND SO I HAVE TURNED TO SOMETHING THAT I THINK WE HAVE HEARD ABOUT BEFORE, WHICH IS MASLOW'S HIERARCHY OF NEEDS, TO REALLY THINK ABOUT WHERE WE ARE IN THIS MOMENT AND HOW TO ENSURE THAT THE BASIC NEEDS WE ALL HAVE, THE PHYSIOLOGICAL NEEDS, BELONGINGNESS AND LOVE NEEDS ARE BEING MET IN THIS MOMENT AND THROUGH THE WORK THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HERE. AND WHAT I WAS REALLY STRUCK WITH, AS I WAS TRYING TO WRAP MY HEAD AROUND THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING, AND THIS WORK, THE CARBON NEUTRALITY WORK, SUSTAINABILITY WORK BROADLY, AND THE WORK IN THE EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER AND ALL OF THE THINGS THAT STAFF ARE DOING DAY IN AND DAY OUT WAS THE PARALLEL BETWEEN THE BASIC NEEDS THAT WE HAVE AS HUMAN BEINGS AND THE WORK THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IN THE CARBON NEUTRALITY EFFORT. WE NEED HEALTHY FOOD, WARMTH, WATER, REST, CLEAN AIR. THOSE ARE ALL THINGS THAT WE ARE TRYING TO PERPETUATE IN THIS WORK. IT'S THE REASON, I'M GOING TO GUESS, THAT YOU VOTED FOR THIS, BECAUSE YOU UNDERSTAND THAT. WE NEED SAFETY. WE NEED BELONGINGNESS AND LOVE, AND THAT COMES IN WITH THE IDEA OF SOCIAL COHESION AND THE SENSE OF COMMUNITY, THE BEAUTIFUL SENSE OF COMMUNITY THAT WE ARE SEEING IN SOME NEIGHBORHOODS RIGHT NOW AS PEOPLE STEP UP TO HELP EACH OTHER DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. BUT THERE ARE GAPS THAT EXIST WITHIN OUR COMMUNITY. CERTAIN NEIGHBORHOODS AREN'T GETTING THAT SAME LEVEL OF SOCIAL COHESIVENESS, SO WE HAVE BEEN THINKING A LOT IN OUR OFFICE ABOUT HOW WE ARE JUMP STARTING THINGS LIKE THE NEIGHBORHOOD AMBASSADOR PROGRAM. THOSE KINDS OF THINGS LAY A FOUNDATION FOR SUCCESS REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE MOTIVATION IS, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER IT'S A PUBLIC HEALTH EPIDEMIC THAT WE ARE DEALING WITH OR IF IT'S A NATURAL DISASTER OR SOMETHING ELSE. AND SO WE ARE PREPARED AND HAVE BEEN PREPARING FOR THE LAST FEW WEEKS TO RUN PRETTY HARD AND FAST WITH THE RESILIENCE ACTIVITIES, BECAUSE WE SEE THEM AS BEING INCREDIBLY RELEVANT AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME. SO I JUST WANTED TO PUT THAT FORWARD, ACKNOWLEDGING -- I DON'T WANT TO ROLL OUT A CARBON NEUTRALITY PLAN DURING A PANDEMIC. THIS ISN'T HOW I THOUGHT THIS WOULD HAPPEN, BUT IT IS WHAT'S HAPPENING, AND I THINK THERE ARE STILL PARALLELS. THERE ARE MANY OF THEM, AND I'M WRITING A PIECE WITH A WHOLE BUNCH OF PEOPLE RIGHT NOW ABOUT THE PARALLELS BETWEEN THIS MOMENT AND THE CLIMATE WORK, AND I'M HAPPY TO SHARE THAT IN THE FUTURE WHEN THAT GETS PUBLISHED. SO, WITH THAT, I WILL END BY SAYING, AS WE SAID, RESILIENCE IS REALLY IMPORTANT, AND SO WE ARE FOCUSING RIGHT NOW AT THIS MOMENT IN OUR OFFICE ON THE THINGS THAT ARE RED, SO HOW ARE WE DOING WITH THE INTERSECTION OF ADAPTING WITH EVERYTHING COMING DOWN THE PIPELINE. WITH THAT, I'LL STOP. QUESTIONS, CONCERNS?
00:30:02.992: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  EXCELLENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THERE ARE QUESTIONS? COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
00:30:19.375: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. THANKS AGAIN TO JACKIE, SARA AND THE IT FOLKS FOR HANDLING THE LOGISTICS FOR TONIGHT. LAST WEEK'S MEETING WENT SMOOTHLY, AND I THINK TONIGHT'S WILL, AND IT ALREADY IS, WILL AS WELL. AND DR. STULTS, I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU AND YOUR TEAM FOR YOUR EFFORT IN DEVELOPING THIS COMPREHENSIVE DETAILED PLAN, AND THANK YOU AS WELL FOR ANSWERING ALL OF MY QUESTIONS THOUGHTFULLY AND PROMPTLY. I WOULD APPRECIATE HAVING THE RESPONSES BEFORE TONIGHT, BUT I'M SORRY, I DO HAVE SOME FOLLOW-UPS, AND THOSE WE DON'T COVER TONIGHT I WILL BE SENDING IN. I DO THINK, DR. STULTS, YOU AND YOUR TEAM HAVE DONE EXACTLY WHAT COUNCIL REQUESTED OF YOU, TO DEFINE WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO ACHIEVE CARBON NEUTRALITY AND DEVELOP A PLAN. IT'S UP TO US TO DECIDE WHAT OUR TAXPAYERS CAN DO. IT'S OBVIOUSLY NOT AN ALL OR NOTHING PROPOSITION. THERE ARE ALSO LAND USE-RELATED STRATEGIES AND ACTIONS WITH MINIMAL EMISSIONS BENEFITS, BUT MANY OF THEM HAVE POTENTIALLY DRAMATIC IMPACTS ON NEIGHBORHOODS, AND THOSE NEED TO BE DISCUSSED MUCH MORE AS WELL, I THINK. SO, I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS AND RESERVATIONS. WE'LL TALK MORE ABOUT THEM NEXT WEEK WHEN WE VOTE ON THE PLAN, BUT TONIGHT, IT'S OBVIOUSLY MORE ABOUT INFORMATION GATHERING. IN THAT REGARD, TWO QUESTIONS. ONE OF MY REQUESTS WAS TO GET A BREAKDOWN OF THE $1 BILLION OF COSTS BY ENTITY, THE CITY, THE COUNTY, THE UNIVERSITY, AAATA, RTA, ET CETERA.  YOUR RESPONSE CLARIFIED THAT THE U OF M REQUESTS WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE 1 BILLION, AND THE RESPONSE REFERRED TO AN ATTACHMENT THAT WASN'T ATTACHED. SO, IF YOU COULD SEND THAT ATTACHMENT, AND IF YOU HAVE THE NUMBERS WITH YOU TONIGHT, IF YOU COULD SHARE THEM, THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. OBVIOUSLY, WE DO NOT HAVE ANY CONTROL OVER THE U OF M OR INDIVIDUALS FOR THAT MATTER, BUT WE DO CONTROL SPENDING. WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR IS THE CITY COSTS, BUT THE OPERATING AND THE CAPITAL BY YEAR IF THE PLAN IS IMPLEMENTED AS PROPOSED. SO IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE WILL BE FOLLOW-UP ON THAT?
00:32:57.933: >> IF WE HAVE A MOMENT, I'LL TRY TO PULL UP THE DOCUMENT. IT IS SORT OF TRICKY. I TRIED TO PULL IT UP IN REAL TIME. I MADE AN ASTERISK AND AM WORKING ON IT FOR YOU. AT A MINIMUM, YOU'LL HAVE IT AS A FOLLOW-UP.
00:33:14.516: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  THANK YOU. IN TONIGHT'S PRESENTATION, YOU TOUCHED ON THE CAVEAT SLIDE ON THE UNIVERSITY. THAT WAS YOUR SLIDE 22, AND IN A RESPONSE TODAY TO A RESIDENT QUESTION THAT WE SAW, YOU INDICATED THIS WAS AFTERNOON THAT, QUOTE, "U OF M IS DEVELOPING THEIR OWN PLAN, AND IT IS VERY LIKELY TO HAVE NOTABLE DIFFERENCES FROM OURS." I APPRECIATE THAT YOU SHARED THAT THEIR GOAL IS NOT YET ESTABLISHED, THEIR PLAN HASN'T BEEN RELEASED, THEY HAVEN'T COMMITTED TO A PLAN YET. BUT I'M WONDERING IF YOU CAN ELABORATE A BIT MORE ON, AGAIN, THE CAVEAT SLIDE AND THE NOTE -- SPECIFICALLY THE NOTABLE DIFFERENCES STATEMENT THAT YOU MADE THIS AFTERNOON, AND ANY OF THE IMPLICATIONS ON POSSIBLE CITY-UNIVERSITY PARTNERSHIP. AND THE REASON THAT I ASK IS -- AND I CAN SEE FROM YOUR RESPONSE THAT THERE'S A LOT -- AND YOU TOUCHED ON THIS TONIGHT TOO -- OF INFORMATION SHARING GOING ON BETWEEN THE CITY AND THE UNIVERSITY. BUT WHAT I REALLY THINK IS NECESSARY IS A CITY-UNIVERSITY RELATIONSHIP THAT GOES BEYOND JUST INFORMATION SHARING AND INCLUDES PARTNERSHIPS ON PROJECTS AND PROGRAMS AND SHARING RESOURCES AND COSTS, AND THE NEW SLIDE AND STATEMENT SUGGEST TO ME THAT THOSE KINDS OF PARTNERSHIPS AREN'T IN THE CARDS YET AND THAT U OF M HAS ITS OWN PLAN.
00:34:47.142: >> YEAH, I WILL TAKE A STAB AT THAT. I MEAN, SOME OF THAT REALLY IS A QUESTION FOR UM TO ANSWER IN DETAIL ABOUT WHAT'S IN THEIR PLAN. SO, WHAT I CAN SHARE IS THAT UM HASN'T -- WHEN I TALK ABOUT THIS PUBLICLY -- I'M GOING TO PULL BACK. THE WAY I EXPLAIN THE PROCESS IS WE DID A MOONSHOT, RIGHT? WE SET A GOAL, AND THEN WE SAID WE ARE GOING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THERE. UM'S METHODOLOGY IS THE INVERSE. THEY ARE DOING INCREDIBLY DETAILED ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE WHAT IS EVEN POSSIBLE BEFORE SETTING A GOAL. SO THAT HAS CREATED A LITTLE BIT OF TENSION, RIGHT, IN THAT WE SET A GOAL AND WE ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL, AND WE DON'T KNOW YET WHAT UM'S GOAL IS. I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE CAVEAT IS KIND OF MEANT TO ELUCIDATE. FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU SEE ONE OF OUR STRATEGIES, WE ANTICIPATE ELECTRIFICATION, PRETTY LARGE SCALE ELECTRIFICATION HAPPENING AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN. THEY ALSO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT ELECTRIFICATION AND THINKING ABOUT IT, BUT WHAT YEAR WILL THAT COME INTO PLAY IS A DIFFERENT QUESTION THAT WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND, AND WITH THEIR PLAN NOT BEING DONE, WE MODELED WHAT WOULD BE NEEDED TO ACHIEVE CARBON NEUTRALITY IN THE COMMUNITY, ASSUMING UM WAS IN. WE ALSO MODELED ASSUMING UM DID NOT PARTICIPATE, AND SO PART OF THE ANALYSIS THAT WE ARE PUTTING TOGETHER RIGHT NOW IS UPDATING THOSE FIGURES TO SHOW THE DIFFERENCE, THE GAP, SO THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT WOULD BE LEFT. IF WE FIGURED IT OUT AND UM DOESN'T -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY OTHER THAN THAT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS.
00:36:23.305: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  YEAH. WHEN YOU SEE THAT THEY CONTRIBUTE TO 32% OF THE TOTAL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND [ OFF MIC ] -- ELECTRICITY [ OFF MIC ] --
00:36:37.052: >> WE ARE ALSO WORKING -- I AM NOT SURE HOW USEFUL THIS IS, WE ARE WORKING ON A SPECIAL MEETING WITH MANAGEMENT AT UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN TO DO AN UNVEILING AND START TO TALK IN DEPTH ABOUT THE KINDS OF CONVERSATIONS THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. MANY OF OUR TECHNICAL ADVISORS ARE LEAD FACULTY AT THE UNIVERSITY WHO SIT ON BOTH THE CARBON NEUTRALITY AND THE CITY'S WORK, BRINGING IDEAS BACK AND FORTH. SO THOSE KINDS OF PARTNERSHIPS ARE VERY STRONG. I SIT ON THEIR COMMISSION, SO THAT'S WONDERFUL, BECAUSE WE ARE SEEDING IDEAS BACK AND FORTH. I HAVE A DREAM OF A REAL PARTNERSHIP, WHERE WE HAVE PROPS AN MOU THAT WE SIGN EVERY FEW YEARS THAT OUTLINES THE EXACT ACTIVITIES THAT WE ARE WORKING ON FROM A RESEARCH PERSPECTIVE AND HOW THEY ALIGN WITH THE CITY'S GOALS AND OBJECTIVES, AND IT'S WIN-WIN FOR BOTH PARTIES, AND IT'S A WIN FOR STUDENTS, BECAUSE THEY ARE GETTING REAL-WORLD EXPOSURE. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT EMERGE. THAT'S A CONVERSATION FOR ALL OF US, AND PROBABLY YOU GUYS, TO BE -- YOU KNOW, IF THAT WAS OF INTEREST, DRIVING A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN PERHAPS US AS STAFF.
00:37:34.843: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  SO, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND MAYBE AS YOU LEARN MORE ABOUT THE PLAN FOR THESE MEETINGS AND -- BECAUSE, AGAIN, YOU PLANTED A SEED, AND IT'S VERY LIKELY TO HAVE NOTABLE DIFFERENCES. IF YOU COULD SHARE, REPORT OUT ON WHAT YOU KNOW SPECIFICALLY, MORE SPECIFICALLY. AS YOU SAID, THEY ARE DOING A DETAILED ANALYSIS, BUT ANY OF THAT INFORMATION THAT YOU GET AND YOU COULD SHARE WOULD BE APPRECIATED. AND ONE LAST QUESTION RIGHT NOW, IF I MAY, AND THIS HAS TO DO WITH YOUR OSI BUDGET REQUEST FOR FISCAL YEAR '21. AGAIN, I APPRECIATE THE CLARIFICATION THAT THE REQUEST IS 1.85 MILLION AND NOT THE 1.3 THAT WAS ON THE MARCH 30TH PRESENTATION SLIDE. I ALSO APPRECIATE THE BREAKDOWN THAT YOU PROVIDED BY FUND, BUT WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND THOUGH IS HOW YOU CAN BE ADDING THREE NEW FTEs AND ANOTHER $115,000 IN NEW FUNDING BEYOND THAT, AND THE TOTAL DEPARTMENT BUDGET IS ABOUT THE SAME AS FISCAL YEAR '20. SO I'M WONDERING WHAT'S GOING AWAY -- [ OFF MIC ] -- THAT WAS IN FISCAL YEAR OF '20.
00:38:43.445: >> YEAH, THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION. SO, WE HAD APPROPRIATIONS THAT CARRIED OVER FROM '19 INTO FISCAL '20, SO THAT WAS A LITTLE BIT OF THE BUMP, WHY THERE WAS AN INCREASE IN THAT YEAR. BUT WHAT WE ARE PROPOSING IS TO ACTUALLY PAY FOR THE THREE NEW FTEs THROUGH THE MILLAGE, THE COUNTY REBATE FUNDING, SO TAKING SOME OF THE PROGRAMMATIC DOLLARS AND PUTTING THEM TOWARDS STAFFING, BECAUSE WE THINK WE CAN FUND PROGRAMMATIC DOLLARS, BUT IT'S THROUGH POTENTIALLY GRANT SOURCES, BUT IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GET PRIVATE DOLLARS TO FUND PEOPLE.
00:39:18.880: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  OKAY, BUT THAT'S STILL -- THAT'S MILLAGE MONEY. I'LL FOLLOW UP ON THAT LATER (SIMULTANEOUS SPEECH) -- THE SAME -- YEAH.
00:39:26.421: >> OH, THE STAFFING IS IN THE -- MINUS THE SPECIFIC PEOPLE, SO THE DOLLAR -- I CAN TRY TO SHOW THE SLIDE, IF THIS IS VALUABLE. THE SLIDE WHERE WE LISTED -- IT'S SLIDE 26. EVERYTHING LISTED IS GENERAL FUND AS AN IMPACT, EXCEPT FOR THE CASH FOR THE FTEs. THE FUNDING FOR THE FTEs IS PROPOSED IN THE COUNTY REBATE.
00:39:53.882: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  THANKS. I'LL LIKELY FOLLOW UP ON THAT. THANKS.
00:39:56.418: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER NELSON?
00:39:57.385: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION TONIGHT, AND THANK YOU ALSO FOR ANSWERING QUESTIONS. THE WRITTEN QUESTIONS, I READ THEM EARLIER TODAY. I DIDN'T SUBMIT ANY MYSELF, BUT I SEE THAT JANE DID MY WORK FOR ME. SHE ASKED A FEW QUESTIONS THAT I WOULD HAVE ASKED. I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON ONE OF THE ANSWERS THAT YOU HAD FOR JANE ABOUT FUND-RAISING, AND I WAS JUST CURIOUS, AS A SPECIFIC, HOW MUCH -- WHAT KIND OF FUND-RAISING HAS HAPPENED UP TO NOW? HOW MUCH MONEY HAS BEEN FUND RAISED THIS PAST YEAR.
00:40:36.424: >> YEP, SO WE VERY CANDIDLY HAVEN'T HAD A LOT OF TIME TO DO THE KIND OF FUND-RAISING -- WELL, I ENJOY FUND-RAISING, BUT THE LAST FOUR AND A HALF MONTHS HAVE BEEN CARBON NEUTRALITY, AS YOU CAN PROBABLY IMAGINE. SO THE PROPOSALS THAT WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY SUBMITTED -- WE HAVE $10,000 FROM THE NATIONAL LEAGUE OF CITIES TO CONTINUE LOOKING AT OUR WORK ON CLIMATE BASED MIGRATION. WE WON ANOTHER GRANT BUILDING OFF THE NATIONAL LEAGUE OF CITIES GRANT TO LOOK AT THE SAME THING, MOSTLY THROUGH PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS. WE DID SUBMIT A $200,000 JOINT MATCH WITH A PARTNERS FOR PLACES GRANT. IT HAD TO HAVE A LOCAL FUNDRAISER, IN THAT CASE, THE ANN ARBOR AREA COMMUNITY FOUNDATION, AND A NATIONAL FUNDER. WE DON'T KNOW WHO THAT IS. WE JUST HAVE TO GET THE NATIONAL FUNDER TO COME THROUGH. THAT WOULD BE $200,000. WE ARE WORKING ON A DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY CONNECTED CITIES GRANT, WHICH WOULD BE A TOTAL OF $7 MILLION SPLIT AMONG A NUMBER OF INSTITUTIONS THAT I JUST STARTED WORKING ON THIS WEEK.
00:41:50.732: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT FUNDS THAT ARE GOING TO PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS, I THINK MAYBE I'M UNCLEAR. SO, YOU'RE GRANT WRITING FOR MONEY THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY GOING TO THE CITY? OR --
00:42:04.846: >> FAIR QUESTION. SO, NOT ALWAYS. IT DEPENDS ON WHAT IT IS WE ARE TRYING TO DO. SO, SOMETIMES WE NEED A RESEARCHER TO ANSWER QUESTIONS FOR US, AND WE CAN'T DO THAT, SO IT'S FUND-RAISING TO GET QUESTIONS ANSWERED WHERE WE MAY NOT HAVE THE SKILLS AND MIGHT HAVE TRADITIONALLY HIRED A CONSULTANT TO DO. OTHER TIMES, WHAT WE ARE FUND-RAISING FOR IS THE MONEY FOR US TO BE ABLE TO DO PART OF THE WORK. SO THE AGING IN PLACE EFFICIENTLY PROGRAM HAS MONEY IN THERE THAT WE WOULD GET TO HIRE AN EQUITY FELLOW TO HELP US DESIGN THE PROGRAM. IT'S GOT SOME STAFFING SUPPORT FOR US TO COVER TIME TO BE ABLE TO DO THE WORK, BUT, MORE, IT'S THE PROGRAMMATIC DOLLARS THAT WE WOULD BE ALLOCATING TO THE SENIORS WHOSE HOMES WE WERE GOING INTO TO DO THE WORK. SO IT'S THE CAPITAL DOLLARS THAT WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO PULL FROM OUR BUDGET AND WOULD BE ABLE TO PULL FROM THAT PROPOSAL. DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?
00:42:54.896: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  YES.
00:42:55.964: >> OKAY.
00:42:56.564: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  I HAD A QUESTION. YOUR PREVIOUS PRESENTATION, YOU HAD NUMBERS, AND IT WAS SLIDE 13, AT LEAST WHEN I WAS VIEWING AT MY COMPUTER, IT TOLD ME IT WAS SLIDE 13, SO I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT RELATES TO INTRODUCTORY SLIDES. BUT 26,000 PEOPLE LIVE AND WORK HERE, AND 24,000 COMMUTE OUT, AND 83,494 COMMUTE IN. SO, WHILE I HAD A FIRST QUESTION, WHICH IS MAYBE AN OBVIOUS STUPID QUESTION, BUT IS THIS JUST COUNTING ADULTS? BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THE POPULATION OF ANN ARBOR IS MORE THAN THE 44,000 SUM. IS THAT WHY THE TWO NUMBERS DON'T ADD UP TO THE POPULATION OF ANN ARBOR?
00:43:49.050: >> I'M GOING TO HAVE TO DOUBLE-CHECK, BECAUSE THAT WAS A FIGURE THAT WAS SHARED WITH US. MY INITIAL READ OF THAT IS THAT'S VEHICLES.
00:43:57.425: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  OKAY. I WAS LOOKING AT THE NUMBERS LIKE THE POPULATION OF ANN ARBOR IS LIKE 121,000, AND YOU ADD UP THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE AND WORK HERE AND THE ONES WHO COMMUTE OUT, AND YOU'RE UP TO LIKE 45,000. SO THAT DIDN'T OCCUR TO ME. MAYBE IT'S CHILDREN OR SOMETHING.
00:44:13.408: >> NO, NO, NO.
00:44:14.676: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  OKAY.
00:44:15.944: >> YEAH, SO I'M PRETTY CONFIDENT IT'S VEHICLES, BUT I'M GOING TO MAKE A NOTE AND CIRCLE BACK AND CONFIRM.
00:44:22.717: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  MY OTHER QUESTION WAS OF THE 83,494, DO WE HAVE A SENSE OF HOW MANY OF THEM ACTUALLY WOULD WANT TO LIVE IN ANN ARBOR? AND I ASK THIS QUESTION BECAUSE I'M A FAMILY CHOOSES TO LIVE IN ANN ARBOR, AND MY HUSBAND DOESN'T WORK IN ANN ARBOR. HE'S A COMMUTING OUT PERSON, AND THE PLACE WHERE HE WORKS, IT JUST DOESN'T HAPPEN TO BE A PLACE WHERE WE'D PARTICULARLY WANT TO LIVE. ANN ARBOR IS WHERE WE'D WANT TO LIVE, AND I THINK IT'S TRUE FOR OTHER PEOPLE THAT IT'S POSSIBLE TO WANT TO LIVE IN ANN ARBOR AND NOT WORK IN ANN ARBOR. SO THAT'S MY QUESTION, OF THE 83,000 WHO ARE COMMUTING, DO WE HAVE ANY SENSE OF HOW MANY OF THEM WANT TO LIVE IN ANN ARBOR?
00:45:05.360: >> THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION. THAT'S NOT ANYTHING WE HAVE SURVEYED RIGHT NOW, SO I CAN'T ANSWER THAT QUESTION. IT'S A GOOD QUESTION. I DON'T KNOW IF ANYONE ELSE MIGHT HAVE AN ANSWER FROM PREVIOUS STUDIES OTHERS MAY HAVE DONE.
00:45:16.237: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  OKAY. AND THEN I HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION. ON YOUR PREVIOUS PRESENTATION, ON SLIDE 49, YOU TALKED ABOUT LOAN LOSS RESERVES, AND I WAS JUST WONDERING IF YOU COULD EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT. THE WAY IT WAS WORDED ON YOUR SLIDE WAS FUNDS TO PROVIDE CREDIT ENHANCEMENTS FOR RESIDENTS WITH LOWER CREDIT SCORES. SO I GUESS I'M WONDERING, ARE YOU ENVISIONING THAT THE CITY WILL BE LOANING MONEY LIKE A BANK? OR WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE?
00:45:44.666: >> WE HAVE TALKING TO MICHIGAN SAVES, WHICH IS THE STATE'S GREEN BANK ON THIS. THEY ARE NOT GOING TO GET THE SAME INTEREST RATE AS YOU OR I MIGHT GET IF WE GO TO MARKET TODAY, AND SOME CAN'T EVEN GET CREDIT BECAUSE THEIR SCORES AREN'T GOOD ENOUGH OR THEY DON'T HAVE A CREDIT HISTORY. SO A LOAN LOSS RESERVE TELLS THE BANK -- WE ARE NOT LOANING ANY MONEY. IT TELLS THE BANKS WE HAVE MONEY ON RESERVE, SO THEY ARE NOT AS RISKY AS YOU THINK, BECAUSE IF THERE WAS A DEFAULT, WE WOULD COVER THE COST OF THAT. SO THIS PROGRAM, MICHIGAN SAVES ONES RUN, THEY HAVE A LESS THAN 2% DEFAULT RATE. WHEN PEOPLE ACCESS CAPITAL, ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO HAVE NEVER HAD IT, THEY TAKE IT HAVE SERIOUSLY AND PAY IT BACK THAT WAY. WE FOUND FROM AN ERROR GRANT THAT WE HAD QUITE A FEW YEARS AGO ABOUT $400,000, AND WE ARE PROPOSING TAKING THAT GRANT MONEY AND PUTTING IT IN THE INITIAL LOAN LOSS RESERVE.
00:46:46.828: >> HOW MUCH WOULD THAT BE?
00:46:48.963: >> 400,000.
00:46:49.631: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  OKAY.
00:46:51.532: >> SO WE ARE TRYING TO GET PERMISSION FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY TO PUT IT IN FOR THAT PURPOSE. IT WAS FOR PACE FINANCING, AND THE MONEY THAT WAS GUARANTEED FOR COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISES, WE ARE PROPOSING TO USE THAT FOR LOW-INCOME POPULATIONS.
00:47:11.953: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  OKAY. AND I THINK I JUST HAD ONE MORE QUESTION, WHICH IS IN YOUR BUDGET, YOU'RE ASKING FOR $25,000 FOR STAFFING AND OUTREACH MATERIALS FOR RESILIENCE HUBS, AND RESILIENCE HUBS ARE MEMORABLE TO ME BECAUSE THIS WAS A BUDGET AMENDMENT THAT WE PASSED IN NOVEMBER OF 2018, AND WE GAVE YOU $10,000 OF SEED FUNDING FOR RESILIENCE HUBS. I WAS CURIOUS, IN NOVEMBER 2018, I HAD TO GOOGLE WHAT A RESILIENCE HUB WAS. WHAT DID YOU DO WITH THE $10,000 FOR RESILIENCE HUBS?
00:47:47.956: >> A BUNCH OF COMMUNITY OUTREACH ENGAGEMENT EVENTS. THIS HAS PROVEN TO BE THE MOST MEMORABLE STRATEGY FOR REACHING OUT TO THE PUBLIC. WE STARTED SOME INITIAL MAPPING OF WHAT COULD BE INCLUDED IN A RESILIENCE HUB, BROUGHT TOGETHER STAKEHOLDERS AND WORKED ON THE DESIGN FOR THE BASE PROCESS MATERIALS. WE HAVE STARTED MEETING WITH SOME ON THE SOUTHWEST SIDE. AND WE ARE ACTUALLY PROPOSING TO SCALE UP THE CONCEPT OF RESILIENCE HUBS, MAYBE THINKING ABOUT THEM A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY GIVEN THE EXPERIENCE WITH COVID-19, SO THINKING ABOUT HOW WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO NOT JUST HAVE BIG CENTRALIZED SPACES BUT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO USE MORE SOFT INFRASTRUCTURE TO FOSTER NEIGHBORHOOD RESILIENCE THAT COULD EVENTUALLY LEAD TO SOMETHING LIKE THE MODEL PRESENTED BEFORE, WHERE WE DO HAVE A CENTRAL GATHERING PLACE, BUT WHERE WE ARE ALSO LEVERAGING OUR I THINK BEAUTIFUL AND SINCERE DESIRE RIGHT NOW TO FOSTER RESILIENCE AND MORE SOCIAL COHESION LONG TERM.
00:48:59.994: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  DID I HEAR YOU SAY THERE ARE TWO LOCATIONS LOOKING AT RESILIENCE HUBS, SOUTHEAST AND WEST SIDE? WHERE ARE THEY?
00:49:08.469: >> OH, NO.
00:49:09.370: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  IS THAT NOT WHAT YOU SAID? I THOUGHT YOU SAID ON THE SOUTHEAST SIDE AND THE WEST SIDE.
00:49:14.342: >> YOU'RE RIGHT. I JUST TOTALLY DREW A BLANK ON THE NEIGHBORHOOD NAMES IN THAT MOMENT. I'M GOING TO LOOK AT THE CHAT, WHERE MY TEAM IS ANSWERING QUESTIONS THAT I'M DRAWING A BLANK ON. CAN I GET RIGHT BACK TO YOU?
00:49:25.987: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON: UH-HUH. I THINK I'M DONE. THANK YOU. .
00:49:34.829: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  WE NOW HAVE COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
00:49:37.598: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  THANK YOU, AND THANKS TO STAFF FOR PUTTING THESE MEETINGS TOGETHER ON A SHORT TIMELINE. IT'S BEEN VERY HELPFUL, AND STAFF HAS BEEN VERY HELPFUL, OBVIOUSLY, IN GETTING THIS ACCOMPLISHED. SO MANY THANKS TO THEM. I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF POIGNANT QUESTIONS, PERHAPS. I DO APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT YOU AND YOUR TEAM HAVE PUT INTO THIS. WE ASKED FOR SOMETHING, AND WE GOT A PRETTY DRAMATIC PLAN IN RESPONSE TO THE CALL THAT WE PUT OUT LAST YEAR. THE PRICE TAG IS SIGNIFICANT, AND ONE THAT, YOU KNOW, MANY PEOPLE JUMP TO FIRST. AND I WOULD LIKE YOU MAYBE PERHAPS -- I'M NOT SURE IF YOU CAN EVEN ANSWER THIS, BUT THE DISCONNECT BETWEEN WHAT THE FOLKS WHO FILLED OUT THE SURVEY WERE WILLING TO PAY A MONTH FOR CARBON NEUTRALITY AND THE ACTUAL COSTS OF GETTING CARBON NEUTRALITY. I THINK THE SURVEY SAID THAT THE AVERAGE WAS ABOUT $10 A MONTH THAT FOLKS WERE WILLING TO PAY TO ACHIEVE CARBON NEUTRALITY, AND YET THE PLAN AS PROPOSED IS TEN TIMES THAT AMOUNT. HOW ARE WE AS ELECTED OFFICIALS AND OTHER MEMBERS IN OUR COMMUNITY ABLE TO MAKE THAT CONNECTION BETWEEN THE EXPECTATIONS AND THE REALITIES OF WHAT IT'S GOING TO COST TO DELIVER ON THAT WITH WHAT WE HAVE HERE? AGAIN, I AM NOT SURE IF YOU CAN ANSWER THAT OR NOT, BUT IT JUST SEEMS LIKE THERE'S A STRONG DISCONNECT WITH WHAT THE COST IS AND WHAT OUR GOALS ARE AND W WHAT -- WAS IT A PART OF ANY OF THE OUTREACH, ANY OF THE MEETINGS THAT YOU HAD, ANY TOWN HALL DISCUSSIONS? HOW MUCH FOCUS AND INFORMATION WAS GIVEN ON THE COSTS IN PURSUING OUR GOALS?
00:52:10.618: >> IT IS A BIG QUESTION THAT HAS MANY LAYERS, AS YOU KNOW. THIS IS COMMON AND HUMAN NATURE, RIGHT, IS THAT WE WANT EVERYTHING BUT WE DON'T WANT TO PAY FOR EVERYTHING. SO I THINK WE SHOULD ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THAT IS GENERALLY TRUE. WHAT WE DID, TO YOUR QUESTION VERY POINTEDLY, IS AS SOON AS WE KNEW THE COSTS, WE STARTED TALKING ABOUT THE COSTS. WE DIDN'T HIDE IT. YOU KNOW, WE KNEW THE COSTS LITERALLY HOURS BEFORE OUR SECOND TOWN HALL THAT WE HAD IN FEBRUARY, AND WE WENT INTO THAT TOWN HALL, AND WE SAID THOSE COSTS, AND WE TOLD PEOPLE, AND WE ASKED FOR RESPONSES. AND FROM THERE ON OUT, EVERY PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT EVENT GOT PEOPLE'S REACTIONS TO THAT DOLLAR AMOUNT, AND WE DID NOT -- OUR ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY DID NOT FOCUS ON GOING TO THE CHOIR OVER AND OVER AGAIN JUST TO HEAR WHAT WE WANTED TO HEAR. OF COURSE WE TALKED TO PEOPLE WHO ARE CLIMATE CHAMPIONS AND VANGUARDS, AND THEY ARE A REALLY IMPORTANT CONSTITUENCY, BUT WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT TO PEOPLE IN OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING SITES, AND WE TALKED TO PEOPLE THAT WERE CAREGIVERS AT THE HANDS ON MUSEUM, AND WE TALKED TO PEOPLE AT THE NEUTRAL ZONE. SO WE TRIED TO GET LOTS OF DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES. AT THE END OF THE DAY WE ASKED PEOPLE HOW TO FINANCE THINGS, BECAUSE WE WANTED TO UNDERSTAND, AND WHAT WE SAW WAS AN APPETITE WITH A STRONG DESIRE FOR US TO FIND OTHER WAYS TO FUND IT. YOU KNOW, PEOPLE, WHEN WE ASKED THEM THE QUESTION WHAT WOULD YOU CUT, THEY SAID NOTHING. AND SO I DON'T KNOW HOW TO RECONCILE THAT. I HOPE YOU -- I WOULD WELCOME YOUR IDEAS.
00:53:57.525: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  WELL, I APPRECIATE THE HONESTY IN ANSWERING THAT QUESTION. I WAS JUST PUTTING IT OUT THERE TO TRY TO HELP PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF, IN MY POSITION, TO GET TO WHERE WE NEED TO GO.
00:54:13.107: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:   --
00:54:18.479: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, MAY I INTERJECT FOR A MOMENT? THIS IS TOM CRAWFORD. I HAD TO JOIN BY PHONE. AS AN ASPIRATIONAL PLAN, WE HAVEN'T ACTUALLY GOTTEN FAR ENOUGH TO HAVE A DETAILED FINANCING PLAN DEVELOPED. I DON'T THINK STAFF HAS. BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE NEEDS HERE, BEING LIKE INFRASTRUCTURE, THOSE THINGS OFTEN COME WITH FEDERAL OR STATE FUNDING AND SOME LOCAL MATCHES, AND SO IT STRIKES ME THAT SOME OF THE LARGER NUGGETS OF THE PLAN, AS WE MOVE FORWARD, IT'S AN AREA THAT WE CAN VIEW AS AN OPPORTUNITY WHERE, FOR EXAMPLE, IF THERE'S AN INFRASTRUCTURE STIMULUS PLAN THROUGH THIS EVENT, MAYBE SOME OF THIS WILL FIT INTO THAT. AND AS YOU GO THROUGH THE TEN YEARS, YOU KNOW, I THINK IT'S LOOKING FOR THOSE OPPORTUNITIES. BUT THEN SUPPLEMENTING THAT, WHEN I JUST DID THE HIGHER LEVEL MATH ON IT, YOU BACK UP THE INFRASTRUCTURE, YOU KNOW, THERE'S ABOUT 160 -- I BELIEVE THERE'S $160 MILLION OR SO OF NONINFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING, AND JUST -- I WAS JUST LOOKING AT THE NUMBERS HERE, IF YOU HAD 80,000 RESIDENTS PAYING $10 A MONTH, THAT WOULD GET YOU ABOUT $10 MILLION A YEAR. THAT GOES A LONG WAY WITHOUT EVEN BONDING AGAINST IT TOWARD THE NONINFRASTRUCTURE SIDE. SO I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT WE HAVE AN ANSWER TO THIS AT THIS TIME. THAT WOULD DEFINITELY BE OVERSTATING IT. BUT I THINK WHAT STAFF HAS DONE IS DEVELOPED A BROADER PLAN THAT ALLOWS US TO START LOOKING FOR OPPORTUNITIES AND BY BITS AND PIECES SEEING IF WE CAN FILL IN SOME GAPS.
00:56:08.189: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  I APPRECIATE -- GO AHEAD, IF YOU NEED TO FINISH. WELL, THAT LEADS ME TO KIND OF MY SECOND QUESTION OR POINT, IS WHETHER THIS CAN BE DONE IN A WAY WHERE IT'S ALL OR NOTHING OR BITS AND PIECES, AS OUR CITY ADMINISTRATOR JUST TALKED ABOUT, TAKING SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE DIGESTIBLE AND PAYABLE, OR DOES IT ALL HAVE TO BE DONE AT ONCE? AND FROM WHAT I UNDERSTOOD IS THAT THIS IS NOT A -- WE CAN'T CHERRY PICK THIS PLAN. WE NEED TO TAKE IT IN ONE PILL.
00:56:56.904: >> NO. SO WHAT WE WERE TRYING TO SAY IS THAT IT'S NOT AS SIMPLE AS LOOKING AT THE MATH AND SAYING, OH, THIS IS ONLY 2% OF EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS, SO WE ARE JUST GOING TO EXTRACT THAT AND PUT THIS IN, THAT IT PROBABLY IS BIGGER THAN THAT, BECAUSE WE TRIED TO AVOID DOUBLE COUNTING. SO WE CAN ABSOLUTELY PULL THINGS OUT AND PUT OTHER THINGS IN. IT'S JUST YOU HAVE TO GIVE US A CHANCE TO STEP BACK AND SEE HOW THAT RICOCHETS THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THE PLAN, BECAUSE WE WERE REALLY, REALLY CAREFUL NOT TO ASSUME, FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE COMMERCIAL SECTOR, IF WE HAVE FIVE STRATEGIES THAT TOUCH THE COMMERCIAL SECTOR, WE DIDN'T WANT TO DOUBLE COUNT. WE WANTED TO BE HONEST ABOUT WHAT IT WAS GOING TO TAKE TO GET THE COMMERCIAL SECTOR TO THIS GOAL. IF WE PULL SOMETHING OUT, IF WE PULL ONE OF THE FOUR STRATEGIES AS A HYPOTHETICAL OUT, WE HAVE GOT TO MAKE SURE TO GO BACK TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPLICATIONS FROM THE OTHER THREE AND THEN COME IN AND FILL THE GAP. THAT'S WHAT WE WERE TRYING TO SAY.
00:57:50.858: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  OKAY. AND I WAS AT A WORKSHOP NOT TOO LONG AGO THAT TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THE, YOU KNOW, NEEDS THAT THESE APPLIANCES HAVE, IF WE WERE TO SWITCH FROM GAS TO ELECTRICAL FOR COOKING AND THINGS LIKE THAT, AND THE FACT IS THAT WE DON'T EVEN HAVE THE ELECTRICAL PANELS IN OUR HOMES AND OUR BUSINESSES TO MAKE THAT TYPE OF SWITCH. HAVE YOU -- DO YOU KNOW WHETHER WE EVEN HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN OUR BUSINESSES AND OUR BUILDINGS AND OUR HOMES TO MAKE A SWITCH? I MEAN, MANY OF THESE HOMES ONLY HAVE 100 OR 200-AMP PANELS, AND YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING WHERE THE NEEDS ARE FAR GREATER THAN 200 AMPS, OR A BUSINESS WITH ONLY A 400-AMP PANEL, BUT NOW YOU HAVE TWO OR 3,000 AMPS THAT ARE REQUIRED. AGAIN, I'M SORRY TO THROW THIS AT YOU, BUT IT'S A CONCERN THAT I HAVE, THAT, YOU KNOW, WE FRANKLY DON'T EVEN HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO MEET THESE, IF WE HAD TO MAKE THE SWITCH TOMORROW.
00:59:00.561: >> YEAH, I MEAN, ABSOLUTELY. EVERYTHING VARIES, DEPENDING ON WHEN THE HOUSE WAS BUILT, YOU KNOW, WHAT ITS ELECTRICAL LOAD LOOKS LIKE, WHEN IT WAS UPDATED. SAME IN OUR COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISES. SOME FOLKS HAVE DONE ELECTRICAL UPGRADES, SOME HAVEN'T. SO, TO THE EXTENT WE CAN, THE WAY THAT WE HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THE PLAN IS NOT JUST -- IT'S NOT JUST YOU REPLACE A FOR B, RIGHT? IT IS A PACKAGE DEAL, WHERE THE ELECTRICAL UPGRADES ARE FACTORED INTO THE CALCULATIONS OF WHAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE THIS ADDITIONAL LOAD. AND WE HAVE BEEN THINKING, AS YOU SAW, ABOUT THINGS LIKE BATTERY STORAGE, SO THAT'S A RESILIENCE STRATEGY, BUT IT IS ALSO REDUCING DEMAND ON THE FORMAL ELECTRICAL GRID. SO YOU ARE A HUNDRED PERCENT RIGHT. THIS ISN'T -- I'M NOT SURE HOW TO SAY THIS. WHAT YOUR JOURNEY MIGHT BE AS A HOMEOWNER IS DIFFERENT THAN WHAT MY JOURNEY MIGHT BE AS A HOMEOWNER, BECAUSE OUR INFRASTRUCTURE IS DIFFERENT IN THAT PLACE, AND SO THAT'S PART OF THE REASON THERE'S A STAFFING COST THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH THIS, IS BECAUSE IT'S NOT -- IT'S NOT A ONE-SIZE-FITS-ALL IN HOW WE DO THIS. IT IS GOING TO ACTUALLY TAKE TIME AND EFFORT TO SUPPORT THE MARKETPLACE AND THE INDIVIDUALS MAKING TRANSITION. SO, YOU'RE RIGHT.
01:00:15.736: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI: THANKS FOR ANSWERING MY QUESTIONS.
01:00:19.740: >> YEAH.
01:00:20.374: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER EATON, SMITH, HAYNER AND GRISWOLD. COUNCILMEMBER EATON?
01:00:26.647: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  THANK YOU. I JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF COMMENTS AND THEN A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ALL OF THE WORK THAT YOU HAVE PUT INTO THE PLANNING THAT YOU HAVE GIVEN US, AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE URGENCY THAT YOU'VE ACCEPTED WITH OUR CLIMATE EMERGENCY RESOLUTION. IF I COULD ASK, CAN YOU START NUMBERING THE PAGES OF YOUR POWERPOINT PRESENTATIONS?
01:00:52.306: >> ABSOLUTELY. IT WAS AN OVERSIGHT. I THOUGHT ABOUT IT THIS AFTERNOON. I'M SORRY.
01:00:56.477: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  WE HAVE A NUMBER OF THEM FROM YOU THAT DON'T HAVE ANY PAGE NUMBERS. AND ALSO, USE LESS COLOR IN THE GRAPHS SO THAT WE DON'T BURN THROUGH TONER SO QUICKLY. SO, I NOTE THAT THIS HAS A $1 BILLION PRICE TAG, BUT MORE THAN 70% OF THAT IS ACTUALLY IMPROVED REGIONAL AND LOCAL TRANSIT AND THE PURCHASE OF ELECTRIC BUSSES. HOW DEEPLY HAVE YOU DISCUSSED THOSE PLANS WITH OUR TRANSIT AGENCIES?
01:01:32.546: >> WELL, THEY ARE PART OF THE FORMAL PLANNING PROCESS. THEY WERE TECHNICAL ADVISORS IN THE PROCESS. WE HAVE HAD FOLLOW-UP CONVERSATIONS ABOUT IT. I HAVE A SENSE YOU HAVE A FOLLOW-UP QUESTION, THOUGH.
01:01:43.924: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  I DO. BECAUSE IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE ISN'T CURRENTLY AN ELECTRIC BUS THAT'S CAPABLE OF RUNNING ON THE BATTERIES THAT THEY HAVE FOR AN ENTIRE SERVICE DAY, AND SO IF YOU REPLACE EVERY BUS WITH ELECTRIC BUSSES, YOU WOULD HAVE TO HAVE MORE BUSSES THAN YOU CURRENTLY HAVE, BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SWITCH THEM OUT DURING THE COURSE OF THE DAY WHEN THE BATTERIES RUN DOWN. SO, HAVE WE CONSIDERED THAT? HAVE WE DISCUSSED THAT WITH AAATA AND U OF M'S TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT?
01:02:17.224: >> YES, ABSOLUTELY. SO PART OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS ARE BROKEN DOWN INTO TWOFOLD. ONE, I SHOULD SAY VERY CANDIDLY WE DO NOT SEE EYE TO EYE ON THE TECHNOLOGY. WE ARE HEARING FROM OTHER TRANSIT AGENCIES THAT ARE HAVING MORE SUCCESS THAN OUR TRANSIT AGENCY PROJECTS THE BUSSES WILL HAVE. WE PROPOSE ADDING BUSSES TO THE FLEET TO COMPENSATE FOR THAT IF WE NEED TO, SO THAT IS PART OF THE COST.
01:02:46.386: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  BECAUSE A FULL CHARGE ON A BUS IS A LENGTHY PROCESS. YOU CAN'T JUST TAKE A BUS OUT OF SERVICE FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS. IT TAKES OVERNIGHT. SO I APPRECIATE THAT YOU'RE LOOKING MORE DEEPLY INTO THAT, BUT THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING ACROSS THE INDUSTRY. THERE ARE SOME FUEL CELL BUSSES THAT HAVE GREATER SUCCESS THAN THE ELECTRIC BUSSES, BUT THAT'S JUST MY UNDERSTANDING. ANOTHER THING IS THAT I NOTICED ON I THINK IT'S PAGE 89 OF THE PREVIOUS POWERPOINT PACKAGE THAT YOU GAVE US, I THINK IT WAS ON THE 30th, THERE'S A GRAPH WHICH SHOWS THAT WE MAKE ALMOST NO PROGRESS UNTIL 2026, AND THEN SUDDENLY WE MAKE A LOT OF PROGRESS, AND THAT SEEMS TO BE BASED ON THE COMMUNITY AGGREGATION OF POWER SUPPLY. HOW DEEPLY HAVE YOU DISCUSSED THE VIABILITY OF STATE LEGISLATION TO ALLOW US TO DO COMMUNITY AGGREGATION?
01:03:52.185: >> IS THERE ANYONE IN PARTICULAR WITH WHOM WE TALKED ABOUT THE VIABILITY WITH, JUST TO CLARIFY?
01:03:58.458: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  WE HAVE A LOBBYIST WHO SEEMS PRETTY ASTUTE ABOUT WHAT'S POSSIBLE IN LANSING, AND I UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE ALL OPTIMISTIC THAT OUR LEGISLATURE COULD CHANGE PARTIES, BUT IN REALISTIC TERMS, HAVE WE DISCUSSED THE LIKELIHOOD OF ACCOMPLISHING THIS LEGISLATIVE GOAL?
01:04:18.845: >> SO, WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT IT WITH OUR STATE LEGISLATORS, OF COURSE, AND THEY ARE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE PROSPECT. BUT MORE I THINK IMPORTANTLY, PERHAPS, IS THAT WE HAVE STARTED WORKING ON THIS WITH MUNICIPALITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE, WHO WE THINK MIGHT ACTUALLY HAVE MORE SUCCESS IN INTRODUCING THE LEGISLATION THAN IF IT COMES FROM US. AND SO THEY ARE PERHAPS NOT AS HIGH-CAPACITY IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO WRITE IT AND DRAFT IT BUT WANT TO PARTNER WITH US TO MOVE FORWARD. SO THAT'S THE STRATEGY WE HAVE TAKEN SO FAR TO DATE.
01:04:51.611: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  WE REALLY DON'T EXPECT MUCH SUCCESS IN THE NEXT THREE OR FOUR YEARS.
01:04:57.818: >> THIS IS ONE WHERE I THINK WE WERE TRYING TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE, YOU KNOW, REALLY GROUNDED IN REALISM ABOUT JUST KIND OF SEEING WHAT WOULD HAPPEN. I DO WANT TO NOTE, THOUGH, THAT IF YOU LOOK AT THE STRATEGIES, WHAT WE ARE PROJECTING IS THAT WE ARE GETTING SOME EFFICIENCY GAINS, BUT WE ARE REALLY FOCUSED ON ELECTRIFICATION. YOU KNOW, IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS, WHILE WE ARE SETTING UP THAT POLICY, THE REASON THE EMISSIONS LOOK THE WAY THEY DO, WE ARE BASICALLY FUEL SWITCHING, RIGHT? SO WE ARE GETTING THE SYSTEM READY TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE THE MASSIVE TRANSITION TO 100% RENEWABLE ENERGY. WE COULD PUSH RESIDENTS TO SIGN UP AT SCALE, AND WE WOULD SEE THAT COME THROUGH THE SYSTEM. THERE ARE OTHER WAYS THAT WE COULD DO THAT. BUT, AGAIN, THE BEAUTY FOR US OF SOMETHING LIKE A CCA, BECAUSE IT'S A STATE-LEVEL POLICY, ONCE IT'S PASSED, ANYONE IN THE STATE CAN DO IT, SO WE GET TO REPLICATE IT. WE GET TO PAVE THE WAY FOR OTHERS TO FOLLOW.
01:05:56.276: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  SO THEN LOOKING AT THAT SUMMARY GRAPH, WHICH SHOWS THE DRAMATIC DECREASE IN CARBON OUTPUT BEGINNING IN 2026, THAT'S PREDICATED BOTH ON THE COMMUNITY AGGREGATION AND ON OUR MASS TRANSIT PLANS. IS THAT PRETTY ACCURATE?
01:06:20.700: >> 2025 IS WHEN WE PROJECTED INVESTMENT IN TRANSIT, RIGHT, SO '26, WE ARE STARTING TO SEE THAT COME TO FRUITION.
01:06:29.676: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  AND LIKE 70% OF THE $1 BILLION ESTIMATED COST IS ACTUALLY GOING TO BE TRANSIT PROJECTS.
01:06:35.015: >> STRATEGY FOUR, THAT'S RIGHT, THE VMT REDUCTION.
01:06:38.385: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  OKAY. AND THAT'S REALLY NOT CITY DOLLARS, RIGHT?
01:06:42.856: >> I MEAN, THE WAY WE PROJECT IT, THERE MIGHT BE SOME CITY DOLLARS THAT GO IN, BUT IT'S REALLY NOT. I MEAN, THIS IS TO COUNCILMEMBER LUMM'S QUESTION. ONE OF MY WONDERFUL TEAM MEMBERS JUST SENT ME THE MATRIX. I'M NOT GOING TO TRY TO TALK FROM IT OFF THE CUFF, BUT YOU'LL SEE THAT WHEN YOU SEE THE MATRIX.
01:07:03.443: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  BECAUSE OVER 70% OF THE $1 BILLION COST IS ACTUALLY TRANSIT PROJECTS.
01:07:08.682: >> UH-HUH.
01:07:09.349: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  THAT'S LIKELY TO BE FTE AND FRA MONEY.
01:07:12.919: >> YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. I MEAN, WE WOULD BE APPLYING -- I IMAGINE THE CITY WOULD BE A PARTNER IN THOSE APPLICATIONS, FOR SURE.
01:07:24.698: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  REALLY?
01:07:25.599: >> DO YOU NOT IMAGINE THAT WE WOULD BE PARTNERING WITH THE RIDE AND OTHERS IN FEDERAL FUNDING?
01:07:31.905: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  WE TYPICALLY DON'T PARTNER ON THE TRANSIT AUTHORITY'S CAPITAL EXPENSE APPLICATIONS, NOT NEARLY AS I KNOW.
01:07:41.815: >> THAT MIGHT BE AN OVERSIGHT ON MY PART. I JUST IMAGINE IF IT'S A PART OF OUR CARBON NEUTRALITY STRATEGY, WE WOULD WANT TO BE AT THE TABLE IN THOSE DISCUSSIONS, BUT THAT MIGHT BE AN OVERSIGHT ON MY PART.
01:07:51.925: >> IN THE FISCAL YEAR 2020 BUDGET, WE ADDED AN FTE FOR I THINK AN ENERGY MANAGER?
01:08:03.270: >> WE ADDED IT FOR A JOINT POSITION WITH COMMUNICATIONS. THE ENERGY MANAGER WE ALREADY ADDED BUT WAS VACANT.
01:08:14.681: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  HAS THAT BEEN FILLED?
01:08:18.251: >> WE HAVE TWO LEFT, BUT WITH COVID-19, WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO BRING THEM IN FOR A FINAL ROUND.
01:08:26.026: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  THAT'S ALL I HAVE.
01:08:27.394: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER SMITH?
01:08:29.129: >> COUNCILMEMBER SMITH:  THANK YOU. DR. STULTS, YOU AND YOUR TEAM HAVE REALLY DONE A GREAT JOB IN A VERY SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME, AND I THINK IF WE EVER WANTED AN EXAMPLE OF HOW OUR STAFF CONSISTENTLY PUNCHES WELL ABOVE OUR WEIGHT, THIS IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THAT. I THINK I JUST WANTED TO MAKE A COUPLE OF POINTS. YOU CAN CHIME IN ON THESE IF YOU WANT, MISSY. ONE IS THAT, YOU KNOW, THE REALITY OF THIS COST IS IT ISN'T ABOUT WHAT WE WANT TO PAY TO GET THERE, BECAUSE WE, OBVIOUSLY, DON'T WANT TO PAY ANYTHING. BUT, YOU KNOW, THIS IS WHAT IT'S GOING TO COST TO GET US TO CARBON NEUTRALITY, AND I THINK EVEN AS CONDITIONS CHANGE, WE HAVE TO KEEP THAT IN MIND AND UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS WHERE WE ARE, THAT WE ARE NOT GOING TO GET TO CARBON NEUTRALITY SIMPLY BY DOING WHAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING ALL OF THESE YEARS. I THINK WE ALSO HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND THAT THE SCHOOL DISTRICT JUST PASSED A BILLION DOLLAR BOND FOR IMPROVEMENTS ON THEIR PROPERTIES THAT DEFINITELY WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON ALL OF OUR DIFFERENT -- OF THE SIX DIFFERENT SECTORS THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT. AND THEN, FINALLY, AND I DON'T THINK THAT I CAN OVERSTATE THIS ENOUGH, IS THAT, YOU KNOW, THE COST OF BORROWING MONEY IN THE NEXT YEAR IS GOING TO BE AS LOW AS IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE IN OUR LIFETIME. I THINK THAT THAT'S AN IMPORTANT THING TO CONSIDER AS WE BREAK DOWN THESE COSTS INTO KIND OF MANAGEABLE CHUNKS OF TIME TO THINK ABOUT. SO, IF WE ARE THINKING ABOUT, YOU KNOW, LOOKING AT TRYING TO RAISE $250 MILLION FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS, THE BORROWING COSTS ON THAT IS GOING TO BE AMAZINGLY SMALL COMPARED TO WHAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SIX MONTHS AGO. SO, I THINK WE HAVE TO KEEP THESE THINGS IN MIND AS WE TALK ABOUT THE BILLION DOLLAR COSTS AND ALL OF THIS, IS HOW DO YOU BREAK IT UP INTO MANAGEABLE CHUNKS AND WHAT IS THE EFFICIENT WAY IN DOING IT. AND, YOU KNOW, TO A LOT OF POINTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE, YOU KNOW, TECHNOLOGIES ARE GOING TO CHANGE ON THINGS, TOO, AND SO I THINK THE ONE THING THAT, MISSY, I KNOW YOU TALK ABOUT A LOT IN YOUR PRESENTATION IS THAT THIS IS AN ITERATIVE AND LIVING DOCUMENT. I DON'T THINK ANYBODY CAN THINK THAT WE ARE GOING TO PASS THIS AND IT'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE. YOU KNOW, MAYBE EVEN A MONTH LATER, IT'S JUST THE NATURE OF THIS STUFF IS AND THE NATURE OF THE SCIENCE. SO, I AM GLAD TO SEE SUCH QUALITY WORK HAS GONE INTO THIS. I'M GLAD TO SEE SUCH THOUGHTFUL SCIENCE HAS COME UP WITH RECOMMENDATIONS, AND I'M EXCITED TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS. GREAT JOB.
01:11:11.091: >> THANK YOU.
01:11:15.495: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
01:11:16.730: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU. QUESTIONS, RIGHT? CAN YOU GUYS HEAR ME OKAY? I HAVE A TERRIBLE CONNECTION. OKAY. THANK YOU. THANKS FOR THE THUMBS-UP. ALL RIGHT, WELL, THANKS, DR. STULTS, FOR TAKING THIS Q&A SESSION HERE. SO, I'M TRYING TO LOOK AT THIS IN A WAY THAT IS UNDERSTANDABLE FOR ME, AND WHEN I LOOK AT, AS AN EXAMPLE, ON THE SUMMARY OF THE SEVEN STRATEGIES, I GUESS I'LL START MY QUESTIONS THERE. SO, COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATION BEING THE FIRST STRATEGY WITH THE HIGHEST POTENTIAL PAYOFF, AND THEN ELECTRIFICATION NEXT -- WELL, ACTUALLY AND THEN OFFSETS, THIRD, AND SO ON, I LIKE TO SEE THINGS LINED UP AND COMPARED LIKE THIS, ESPECIALLY AS IT SHOWS THE COSTS PER TON TO DO THIS. AND I SEE THAT OFFSETS HAVE A VERY LOW COST PER TEN, BUT WE ARE STILL IN FOR 10 MILLION OF THAT. SO, TO GET BACK TO THE START, SO WITH COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATION BEING SOLELY DEPENDENT ON CHANGES IN STATE LEGISLATION, FOR ANY OF THESE THAT ARE DEPENDENT ON CHANGES IN STATE LEGISLATION LIKE THIS, IS THERE A PLAN B, OR DO WE JUST KIND OF PREPARE AND THEN RIDE THAT ONE OUT? I HAVE A SERIES OF QUESTIONS, BUT I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT ME TO ASK THEM ALL NOW OR IF WE WANT TO GO BACK AND FORTH? IS THERE A PLAN B FOR REPLACING CCA IF IT DOESN'T PAN OUT?
01:12:40.480: >> YEAH, SO WE ARE LOOKING AT FOR SOME OF THE STRATEGIES, THERE ARE PLAN BS, THERE ARE PLAN CS. CCA WAS THE ONE THAT WE PUT FORWARD, BECAUSE IT IS THE ONE THAT GETS US THERE PRETTY -- I MEAN, HONESTLY, MOST CCAs AROUND THE COUNTRY ARE AT COST PARITY WITH CURRENT ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS, SO WE DON'T SEE A LOT OF PUSHBACK IF WE CAN GET IT THROUGH AND IT'S SCALABLE. BUT, YEAH, WE ARE THINKING THROUGH OPTIONS, SOMETIMES C OR D, DEPENDING ON WHAT IT IS.
01:13:07.207: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  ALL RIGHT. SO WHEN WE LOOK AT, SAY, ELECTRIFICATION, WELL, WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THE -- I MEAN, I'LL GO TO SOMETHING THAT I KNOW A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT. SO WE TALKED ABOUT ADOPTING 2021 BUILDING CODES TO COME ONLINE IN 2022, AND THAT ALLOWS US TO REQUIRE NET ZERO BUILDINGS, AND SOME OF US, MYSELF INCLUDED, ADVOCATED FOR THAT RIGHT OUT OF THE SHOOT WHEN WE DECLARED A CLIMATE EMERGENCY. I LIKE IN YOUR PRESENTATION YOU SAY WHAT THE VISION IS GOING TO BE IN 2030, AND I FEEL THAT WAY ABOUT THE BUILDINGS THAT WE ARE SUPPOSEDLY APPROVING NOW, IN THAT I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE APPROVING ANY BUILDINGS THAT ARE STILL GOING TO BE STANDING IN 2030 THAT AREN'T NET CARBON ZERO. IS THERE ANYTHING OUT IN THE WORLD WITH CITIES WHO HAVE RECOGNIZED THE SCIENCE BEHIND THESE DIRE CIRCUMSTANCES AND DECLARED CLIMATE EMERGENCIES CREATING OVERLAY DISTRICTS THAT REQUIRE THIS KIND OF CONSTRUCTION NOW, INSTEAD OF WAITING THREE OR FOUR, FIVE YEARS FOR IT TO COME ONLINE? IS THERE ANY WAY WE COULD DO ANYTHING WITH OUR CURRENT CODE TO CREATE AN EMERGENCY OVERLAY DISTRICT AND SO ON THAT WOULD REALLY ASK DEVELOPMENT TO STEP UP NOW INSTEAD OF WAITING THREE YEARS, WHEN -- YOU KNOW, I KNOW THAT CONSTRUCTION IS LIKELY TO TAKE A HIT COMING OUT OF THIS, BUT STILL, I'M JUST WONDERING IF THAT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD TRY AND IMPLEMENT SOONER OF OUR OWN ACCORD.
01:14:44.637: >> IT'S A GREAT SUGGESTION. I NEED TO TAKE THIS BACK AND UNDERSTAND, THERE ARE DEFINITELY COMMUNITIES WHO HAVE DONE IT, BUT AS YOU KNOW, THEIR STATE ENABLING LEGISLATION MAY LOOK DIFFERENT THAN OURS. SO LET ME JUST TAKE A LOOK AND DO A LITTLE BIT OF RESEARCH TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WE COULD POSSIBLY HAVE ROOM TO DO IN MICHIGAN.
01:15:05.458: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  WHEN WE LOOKED AT IT, I THINK THE ESTIMATION WAS ADDING 250 SOME UNITS A YEAR, AND WAS THAT IN THE GREATER WASHTENAW AREA?
01:15:17.437: >> YES.
01:15:17.670: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  SO A LOT OF THAT IS OUT OF OUR CONTROL. BUT THERE HAVE BEEN 6,000 SOME BEDROOMS ADDED IN THE LAST YEAR OR SO, SO I JUST WONDER IF DEVELOPMENT SEES IT'S COMING DOWN THE PIPE AND WE TAKE THE LID OFF OF IT, LIKE AS HAS BEEN SUGGESTED WITH TRANSIT-ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT, THAT THERE WOULD BE A HUGE SURGE, AND THEN WE ARE STUCK WITH A BUNCH OF BUILT BUILDINGS THAT ARE NOT ABLE TO BE ELECTRIFIED, THAT ARE NOT ELECTRIC, AND, YOU KNOW, SORRY. AND SO, YOU KNOW, I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. I WOULD LIKE TO IMPLEMENT THAT SOONER RATHER THAN LATER. SO, WHEN WE ASK THE FOLKS OUT IN THE WORLD, LIKE THE RESIDENTS TO DO THESE TYPES OF THINGS, TO ELECTRIFY THEIR OWN HOMES AND TO DO ENERGY AUDITS AND THINGS LIKE THAT, IS THERE ANY CONSIDERATION OF THE CITY'S ABILITY TO, SAY, OFFER SOME KIND OF TAX CREDIT OR SOMETHING TO PAY FOLKS BACK FOR ENERGETICALLY COMMITTING TO DOING WHAT THEY CAN WITH THEIR PRIVATE PROPERTY TO HELP US OUT?
01:16:25.805: >> I'M GOING TO HAVE TO TURN THAT ONE OVER TO OUR CITY ADMINISTRATOR TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER, BECAUSE I KNOW HE IS MUCH MORE ATTUNED. WHAT I CAN SAY THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT FOR SURE IS HOW WE DO DISCOUNTS. SO JULIE IS HELPING US THINK ABOUT A SOLARIZED PROGRAM AND HOW DO WE SCALE THAT, AND DO THAT IN THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY SECTOR AND THE BATTERY SECTOR, TO GET DISCOUNTS FOR PEOPLE GOING FORWARD. WE ARE CONSTANTLY TALKING TO UTILITIES ABOUT NEW REBATES AND PROGRAMS THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO OFFER TO LOWER THE UPFRONT COSTS. RIGHT NOW, YOU CAN'T GET SUPPORT FOR FUEL SWITCHING FROM OUR UTILITIES, SO WE ARE WORKING PRETTY AGGRESSIVELY TO TRY TO CHANGE THAT. BUT IN TERMS OF THE TAX PIECE, TOM, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING THAT YOU WANT TO ADD.
01:17:12.685: >> SURE. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, THE EXISTING LEGISLATION WOULD NOT PROVIDE FOR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. IN FACT, WHAT I HAVE SEEN AS KIND OF A PHILOSOPHICAL, WE TRIED -- BEFORE, WHICH IS WHERE WE TRIED TO HELP WITH ENERGY IMPROVEMENTS, AND WE TRIED TO GET IT TO APPLY TO RESIDENTIAL, BUT WHEN WE TALKED TO THE STATE ABOUT IT, WE WERE SUCCESSFUL IN GETTING LEGISLATION IMPLEMENTED IN MICHIGAN, BUT IT WAS COMMERCIAL. I THINK MOSTLY WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT TAX CREDITS AND THILTS -- THINGS LIKE THAT, THAT TENDS TO BE FOR THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND NOT RESIDENTIAL. I'M NOT SAYING IT CAN'T BE DONE, BUT IT WOULD DEFINITELY BE A LEGISLATIVE CHANGE.
01:17:58.030: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  OKAY, YEAH. I'M LOOKING FOR WAYS TO INCENTIVIZE FOLKS OUTSIDE OF EDUCATION AND SO ON. I GUESS WHAT I'LL DO IS, BECAUSE THE CLOCK IS TICKING HERE, I'M GOING TO PASS ON THE REST, AND I'LL WRITE THE REST OF THESE UP, DR. STULTS, AND, OBVIOUSLY, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE SOME CONVERSATIONS OVER THE NEXT DAYS AND MONTHS AND YEARS EVEN, AND SO, YEAH, I JUST -- I DON'T KNOW. IT'S A GOOD PLAN, BUT I ALSO HAVE CONCERNS THAT SO MUCH IS RELIANT ON SO MANY OTHERS, AND I THINK IT MAKES IT INCUMBENT ON US, WHERE WE DO HAVE CONTROL OVER THINGS, LIKE WITH THE TRANSIT AUTHORITIES AND SO ON, WE HAVE A COUPLE OF APPOINTMENTS ON THERE IN MAY, TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE PEOPLE IN PLACE TO FORM THE RIGHT PARTNERSHIPS, AND THAT'S WITH TRANSIT AUTHORITY, WITH THE UNIVERSITY, WITH THE ENERGY COMPANIES AND SO ON. I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO TO AFFECT THESE PARTNERS, I GUESS, FOR LACK OF A BETTER DESCRIPTION. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU.
01:18:56.689: >> BEFORE WE LEAVE, I JUST WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WHAT YOU JUST SAID, COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, IS REALLY IMPORTANT, AND I THINK PART OF THE REASON, EVEN HAVING A DIRECTIONAL PLAN, AGAIN, IT IS LIVING, IT ALLOWS US TO GO OUT AND START FORMING THE PARTNERSHIPS AND INFLUENCING THE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO BE INFLUENCING, AND THAT IS PART OF THE STRENGTH FOR US AS STAFF, IS IT LETS US KNOW EXACTLY WHERE WE NEED TO START WORKING IMMEDIATELY. SO I APPRECIATE IT, AND I JUST APPLAUD THAT RECOGNITION, BECAUSE IT IS TRUE.
01:19:24.917: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD? I'M SORRY.
01:19:32.558: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD:  AM I UP?
01:19:33.926: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THERE WAS SOME CROSS TALK THAT I WAS STUMBLING ON, AND I WONDERED, COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER AND MR. CRAWFORD, ARE YOU BOTH DONE?
01:19:44.003: >> YES.
01:19:44.403: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU. COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD?
01:19:46.439: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD: OKAY. I WANT TO THANK STAFF FOR THIS AWESOME PLAN. I AM A HUNDRED PERCENT BEHIND THE GOAL. I CAN TELL YOU THAT IN THE EARLY 1970s, I WAS DRIVING A TWO-CYLINDER HONDA THAT GOT 40 MILES TO THE GALLON. SOME OF THAT WAS DUE TO ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS, BUT MORE IT WAS WAS DUE TO FINANCIAL CONCERNS, BUT I HAVE LIVED IT SINCE THEN. I THINK WE HAVE LOST CONTROL OF THE MESSAGE, AND SO I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE SPEND MORE EFFORT ON COMMUNICATIONS. THAT'S NOT A NEGATIVE, BECAUSE WE ARE MOVING AHEAD QUICKLY, BUT WE REALLY NEED TO AVOID HEADLINES LIKE THE $1 BILLION PLAN, IMPLYING THAT -- AND I KNOW, MISSY, THAT'S -- YOU KNOW, YOU'RE WORKING 110%, AND SO SOME OF THAT IS ON THE BACK OF COUNCILMEMBERS TO TRY TO EXPLAIN THAT AS WELL TO THE MEDIA, BECAUSE IT'S NOT 100 BILLION THAT WE EXPECT OUR TAXPAYERS TO PAY OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS. I'M LOOKING AT THIS PLAN FROM THREE DIFFERENT VALUES OR CRITERIA. ONE IS REGIONALISM. WE WANT -- AND ALSO EQUITY. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ANYTHING THAT WE DO DOESN'T HARM OUR NEIGHBORS, AND SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS CONVERTING OVER TO EV VEHICLES, WHERE ARE THOSE OLDER VEHICLES GOING TO GO? SO IF WE HAVE LESS POLLUTION IN ANN ARBOR BUT WE ARE INCREASING THE POLLUTION IN DETROIT OR DEARBORN, I THINK WE HAVE TO BE AWARE OF THAT. AND IN TERMS OF EQUITY, WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE COST IS BORNE BY ALL OF US, AND THAT RELATES TO LEADERSHIP. IF THERE'S GOING TO BE DISRUPTION, IF THERE'S GOING TO BE PAIN, WE NEED TO, AS THE COMMUNITY'S LEADERS, BE DEMONSTRATING THAT FIRST. YOU KNOW, WHO IS GOING TO ROLL OUT THEIR EIGHT-BURNER COMMERCIAL GAS STOVE? I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THE RIGHT TERM IS FOR IT, FROM A COMMERCIAL STANDPOINT, BUT WE ARE EXPECTING EVERYONE ELSE TO GET RID OF THEIR GAS RANGE, BUT IT'S SOMEWHAT OF A STATUS SYMBOL, AND SO I QUESTION WHETHER THAT IS REALLY GOING TO HAPPEN, AND IF IT IS, AGAIN, WE HAVE TO BE THE LEADERS OF THAT. IN TERMS OF THE, YOU SAID, FAIL FORWARD, IT'S FINE TO FAIL FORWARD WHEN WE ARE DOING SOMETHING THAT'S INNOVATIVE AND UNTESTED, BUT IF IT'S JUST BASIC SERVICES LIKE ROADWAYS AND LIGHTING, WE NEED TO DO IT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME. WE DON'T HAVE THE FUNDING TO MAKE A MISTAKE IN THOSE BASIC AREAS. AND THEN ONE AREA THAT I GUESS IS NOT GOING TO BE PART OF THIS PLAN BUT IS RELATED TO IT, AND I THINK WE NEED TO ADDRESS, IS FLOODING. I THINK WE NEED A STRONGER PLAN TO PREVENT FLOODING, AND IT IS A BIG ISSUE IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD. SO, AGAIN, THANKS TO STAFF.
01:23:17.083: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER GRAND?
01:23:20.653: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRAND:  THANK YOU. I JUST, YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY, THE 82 DAYS FOR STAFF, LIKE, THAT'S -- I DON'T THINK -- WELL, I KNOW WE HAVE NEVER SEEN ANY EFFORT LIKE THAT. THAT'S JUST -- IT'S JUST INCREDIBLE, AND I THINK THAT I DO WANT TO JUST NOT ONLY RECOGNIZE DR. STULTS AND HER STAFF, BUT THAT I CONTINUE TO HEAR FROM MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY. I WAS AT A STUDENT ADVISORY COUNCIL MEETING AND HEARD FROM THE LIAISON THERE FROM THE UNIVERSITY HOW IMPRESSED THEY ARE WITH THIS PLAN, AND I THINK THEY ARE REALLY TAKING NOTICE OF IT, AND I KNOW THEY WERE REPORTING, AGAIN, WITHOUT A LOT OF DETAIL, THAT THERE IS A LOT OF OVERLAP BETWEEN THE UNIVERSITY AND THE CITY'S PLAN. SO, THANK YOU FOR THAT. I ALSO JUST WANT TO THROW OUT TO MY COLLEAGUES, BECAUSE I KNOW THE MILLION DOLLAR BOND WAS MENTIONED, AND I AM MEETING WITH CITY SCHOOLS REPRESENTATIVES, HAVING THAT MEETING ON THURSDAY, AND DR. STULTS IS GOING TO BE JOINING US. SO WE ARE ALREADY STARTING TO TALK ABOUT THOSE COLLABORATIONS. I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT. TO THE MESSAGING, I LOVE THIS REFRAMING OF WHAT WE CAN DO AS A CITY AS ACTORS, BECAUSE I THINK WE CAN PUT A PRICE TAG ASSOCIATED WITH THAT THAT'S NOT A BILLION DOLLARS, AND I THINK THAT CAN HELP A LOT WITH COMMUNICATIONS, AND I AM HOPING, AS WE GO INTO THIS BUDGET CYCLE AND THEN THE NEXT ONE, THAT WE CAN REALLY ATTACH ACTIONS THAT WE CAN TAKE AND THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THEM AND START LOOPING THEM INTO THE BUDGET, BECAUSE I THINK WHEN WE START HAVING TANGIBLE ACCOMPLISHMENTS, THAT'S GOING TO HELP US BUILD MOMENTUM IN THE COMMUNITY. SO I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT MOVING FORWARD WITH THE IDEA OF RESILIENCE HUBS. I TOO CONTINUE -- BECAUSE ONE OF THEM IS, YOU KNOW, ON THE SOUTHEAST SIDE OF ANN ARBOR, WHICH I REPRESENT, AND I KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF COMMUNITY MEMBERS THAT ARE EXCITED ABOUT MOVING FORWARD AND TAKING LESSONS LEARNED, AND I THINK THERE CAN BE A LOT OF COLLABORATION WITH EXPERTS IN THE COMMUNITY ABOUT HOW WE CAN MOVE FORWARD ON THOSE RESILIENCE HUBS. AND I JUST WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO ARE WATCHING OR WHO HAVE WRITTEN TO US, WE GOT SOME REALLY INCREDIBLE MESSAGES FROM THE PUBLIC IN SUPPORT OF THESE ACTIONS, INCLUDING FROM SOMEONE WHOSE HUSBAND WAS IN THE HOSPITAL FIGHTING CORONAVIRUS RIGHT NOW AND WAS STILL REMINDING US ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT IT IS AND THE PARALLELS THAT WE HAVE, AND THAT -- I JUST WANT TO PUBLICLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT, BECAUSE THAT WAS PROBABLY ONE OF THE HARDEST EMAILS I HAVE EVER HAD TO READ AS A COUNCILMEMBER, TO SEE THAT, BUT ALSO JUST A REALLY IMPORTANT REMINDER OF THIS WORK, WHAT IT MEANS TO THE COMMUNITY, WHAT A RESPONSIBILITY WE HAVE TO MOVE FORWARD. SO, I'M JUST LOOKING FOR GETTING BEHIND THIS IN THE BUDGET. I KNOW MR. CRAWFORD IS NOT ONE WHO IS KNOWN FOR BEING, YOU KNOW, LOOSE WITH THE CITY FUNDS, SO THE FACT THAT HE, YOU KNOW, IS COMING OUT ALREADY AND SAYING THAT THERE IS A WAY THAT WE CAN GET A LOT OF THIS DONE AND A LOT OF THIS IS WITH MATCHING FUNDS, AND IF WE CAN FIND SOME STAFF CAPACITY, IF YOU CAN GO OUT AND FUND RAISE IN THE WAY THAT YOU PUT TOGETHER THIS PLAN IN 82 DAYS, I'M REALLY CONFIDENT IN OUR ABILITY TO GET SOME MATCHING FUNDS TO MOVE THIS FORWARD. SO, THANK YOU.
01:26:52.164: >> THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER GRAND, AND COUNCILMEMBER NELSON, JUST REALLY QUICKLY, I HAVE BEEN CHASTISED BY MY SURFACE, BECAUSE THERE ARE THREE HUBS. THERE'S FOREST HILLS AND SISTER LAKES, SO THOSE ARE THE MOST ADVANCED AREAS THAT WE HAVE. I ALSO FORGOT, TOMORROW AFTERNOON I'M ON A CALL, WHERE IT LOOKS LIKE WE ARE A FINALIST FOR A $25 GRANT TO DO SOLAR IN THE COMMUNITY. I APOLOGIZE, I FORGOT THOSE TWO DETAILS.
01:27:31.937: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
01:27:32.805: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  THANKS FOR COMING BACK AROUND. I JUST -- I GUESS I HAD A SUMMARY QUESTION, BECAUSE WE ARE GETTING READY TO PREPARE FOR THE MEETING ON THE 20th, WHICH IS THE BUDGET CHURNING. SO, THIS IS JUST A HYPOTHETICAL. SO, IF WE WERE TO HAVE TO PRIORITIZE SOLUTIONS HERE, WOULD YOU -- DR. STULTS, WOULD YOU PRIORITIZE BASED ON THE COSTS PER TON OF CARBON REMOVED OR THE PERCENT OF TOTAL EMISSIONS AND TIME TO BEGIN REDUCING THOSE EMISSIONS? OR THE TOTAL COST OF THE PART OF THE PLAN? OR WHAT WOULD BE YOUR WAY TO PRIORITIZE -- YOU KNOW, IF WE HAD TO PICK AND CHOOSE BECAUSE OF MASSIVE DROPS IN REVENUES HERE, YOU KNOW, HOW WOULD YOU DO THAT? WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE BEST METHOD TO, YOU KNOW, PRIORITIZE ACTION, TO GET THE BEST RESULTS WHEN WE NEED THEM THE MOST? BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, I LOOK AT THAT CHART YOU GAVE WITH THE SEVEN AREAS, AND IT'S NICE TO SEE THEM ACROSS THERE LIKE THAT, AND YOU CAN JUST SEE HOW RADICALLY DIFFERENT SOME OF THEM ARE, LIKE COMPOST VERSUS RECYCLING, THE COST PER TON OF CARBON REDUCED BUT, OBVIOUSLY, THOSE THINGS -- YOU KNOW, THAT HAS OTHER BENEFITS TO THE COMMUNITY AND SO ON. SO I JUST WONDERED WHAT WOULD BE YOUR SUGGESTION FOR PRIORITIZING ACTION. IS THAT SOMETHING THAT'S IN HERE THAT I HAVE NOT SEEN? OR --
01:29:05.998: >> NO, IT IS BECAUSE I'M -- I MEAN, THIS IS A REALLY HARD THING TO ANSWER, BECAUSE I THINK EACH OF US HAVE DIFFERENT VALUES THAT WE WOULD BRING TO THE PRIORITIZATION PROCESS. AND I'M GOING TO JUST ANSWER FROM ME AS AN INDIVIDUAL. THIS IS HARD. SO I WANT TO STOP. I'M HAVING TO REFLECT MORE. BUT I WOULD SAY THE THINGS THAT I THINK MOST ABOUT ARE EQUITY, AND THAT'S A CO-BENEFIT. SO, HOW ARE WE HELPING OUR MOST VULNERABLE CITIZENS TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THESE TYPES OF PROGRAMS AND SERVICES? AND THEN SCALABILITY AND REPLICATEABILITY, SO HOW ARE WE DOING THINGS THAT OTHERS ARE DOING TO GET TO MASSIVE REDUCTIONS OR AT LEAST STATEWIDE REDUCTIONS? THOSE ARE REALLY IMPORTANT VALUES THAT I HAVE, AS I THINK ABOUT THIS WORK, AND I WOULD -- I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY, DOLLARS AND CENTS MATTER A LOT IN THIS CONVERSATION, BUT YOU'LL FIND THAT THINGS THAT ARE SCALABLE THAT START WITH EQUITY FIRST OFTEN DO PRICE PRETTY WELL AS WELL.
01:30:03.222: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  IS THERE A PR ELEMENT WRITTEN INTO ALL OF THIS? IN OTHER WORDS, WE UNDERSTAND THAT OUR 120,000 PEOPLE HERE IN ONE PLACE IN THE WORLD AREN'T GOING TO STOP THE GLOBAL CO2 EMISSIONS, AND YET WE DO THESE THINGS AS EXAMPLES, LIKE WE DO OTHER THINGS AS EXAMPLES FOR OTHER COMMUNITIES. AND SO IS THE PR ELEMENT WRITTEN INTO ALL OF THIS?
01:30:23.308: >> I'M NOT SURE THAT I FULLY UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION. DO YOU MEAN HAVE WE QUANTIFIED THE VALUE OF THAT?
01:30:29.114: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  WELL, HAVE WE QUANTIFIED THE VALUE, AND HAVE WE QUANTIFIED THE COST OF WHAT IT COSTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS EXPENSE THAT WE ARE SHOULDERING IS AN EXAMPLE THAT OTHERS CAN FOLLOW AND OTHERS ARE FOLLOWING? LIKE, FOR INSTANCE, IT WAS IN THE CONSENT AGENDA LAST WEEK, AND WE BOUGHT ANOTHER ROUND OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES, AND I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO HAVE SEEN THAT ON THE FRONT PAGE OF WHATEVER PAPER IS LEFT. RIGHT? AND SO IS THERE A PR ELEMENT THAT IS BUILT INTO THIS THAT AMPLIFIES OR MULTIPLIES THE EFFORT THAT WE ARE TAKING HERE THAT CAN BE FOLLOWED BY OTHER COMMUNITIES WHO ARE MOTIVATED BY SEEING WHAT WE ARE DOING?
01:31:10.622: >> I THINK YOUR POINT IS REALLY WELL TAKEN, AND IT'S NOT IN HERE EXPLICITLY BUT IT SHOULD BE. THIS ALSO CUTS TO COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD'S QUESTION WITH THE NARRATIVE, IN THAT WE DIDN'T WRITE A PRESS RELEASE THAT SAID IT WAS THE CITY'S $1 BILLION PLAN, BUT THAT'S THE TAG THAT THE MEDIA PICKS UP. CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG, WHAT I'M HEARING YOU SAY IS THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO CONTROL THE NARRATIVE MORE, BY BEING OUT, EXTERNALLY FACING, TELLING PEOPLE WHAT WE ARE DOING AND HOW THAT TIES BACK TO THE CARBON NEUTRALITY WORK. SO WE ARE GETTING RECOGNITION FOR THE LEADERSHIP FOR THINGS LIKE THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE PURCHASE OR THE LANDFILL SOLAR PROJECT -- IS THAT FAIR TO SAY, SO FAR? AM I ON THE RIGHT TRACK?
01:31:58.437: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  YEAH, I THINK IF PART OF THE POINT IS TO MAKE US PART OF THE GLOBAL COMMUNITY -- YOU KNOW, WE DROPPED OUT OF THE PARIS ACCORD, OR THE PRESIDENT DID, SO THE CITIES HAVE TO TAKE OVER. SO HOW DO ALL OF THE CITIES FEEL SUPPORTED BY OTHER COMMUNITIES AND MUNICIPALITIES, KNOWING WE ARE DOING IT, PITTSBURGH IS DOING IT, THIS COMMUNITY, THAT COMMUNITY. I JUST WANTED TO SEE IF THAT WAS A PART OF OUR COST HERE. AND I GUESS THE OTHER ASPECT TO THAT, SETTING THAT ASIDE FOR A SECOND, MY OTHER QUICK QUESTION IS ARE THERE THINGS THAT ARE IN HERE THAT ARE REPLACING OTHER THINGS THAT WE ARE NORMALLY DOING? I'M REALLY INTERESTED IN THE RESILIENCE ASPECTS OF THIS, AND I KNOW OUR DRAINS COMMISSIONER THINKS THAT -- HE WOULD, IF HE COULD, REQUIRE INSTEAD OF 150% FIRST FLUSH RETENTION IT WOULD BE THREE OR 400 PERCENT, ESPECIALLY ON THESE NEW SUBS. AND SO ARE THERE THINGS THAT YOUR OFFICE IS GOING TO START DOING NOW THAT HAS BEEN DONE IN OTHER PLACES WITH OUR STAFF, YOU KNOW, NOT DOUBLING THE EFFORT BUT REPLACING AN EFFORT OR...
01:33:05.937: >> I THINK SUPPLEMENTING WOULD BE A GOOD WAY TO THINK ABOUT THAT, YEAH. I MEAN, WE ARE IN THE EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER, AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE CONSTANTLY THINK ABOUT AND BRING TO BEAR IS THIS IDEA OF RESILIENCE, YOU KNOW, AND HOW WE ARE THINKING ABOUT PEOPLE AND PLACE AND ENHANCING THE WORK THAT WE ARE DOING, NOT JUST FOR COVID-19 BUT FOR EVERYTHING THAT'S COMING DOWN THE PIPELINE, ECONOMIC DISRUPTION, NATURAL DISASTER, ET CETERA.  SO I THINK THAT IS THIS IDEA OF INSTITUTIONALIZING MORE THE THINKING AND SUPPLEMENTING WITH THAT EXPERTISE, IF THAT'S HELPFUL. AND THEN TO YOUR FIRST POINT, THE COSTS OF PR ARE NOT BUILT INTO THE PLAN BECAUSE WE ALREADY HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THAT. BUT ONE OF YOUR POINTS, OR THAT I TOOK AWAY FROM THAT, WOULD BE THE ROLE OF OTHER CITIES, AND PEOPLE ARE PAYING ATTENTION. I MEAN, I WOULD SAY FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, I HAVE GOTTEN A LOT OF EMAILS, AS HAVE YOU, I KNOW, FROM CONSTITUENTS AND PEOPLE IN OTHER AREAS, BUT I HAVE GOTTEN A LOT OF EMAILS FROM PEER CITIES WHO ARE ASKING, YOU KNOW, WHAT CAN WE TAKE? WHAT CAN WE STEAL? THANK YOU FOR STEALING FROM US, IDEAS AND STRATEGIES. THERE WAS A COMMUNITY THAT JUST WROTE TODAY, AND THEY HAVE BEEN DOING A PROJECT WITH PAUL HAWKEN, WHO WAS THE AUTHOR OF PROJECT DRAWDOWN, AND HE HAS APPARENTLY SEEN OUR PLAN, AND HE WE MIGHT HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO SOME WORK WITH HIM BECAUSE IT'S ON THE STREETS. SO THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT BEING A LEADER AND VANGUARD THAT OPENS OPPORTUNITIES THAT WOULDN'T HAPPEN OTHERWISE.
01:34:36.194: >> CAN I ADD ON TO THAT?
01:34:38.563: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  PLEASE.
01:34:39.798: >> THIS IS TOM CRAWFORD SPEAKING AGAIN. THERE IS A COST OF BEING OUT FRONT, AND WE ARE LEADERS OUT FRONT IN THIS, BUT THAT COST, WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE, AS YOU CALL IT, THE PR, IF WE CAN GET THE LEGISLATION DONE THROUGH APPLYING OUR CONNECTIONS AND OUR RESOURCES, WHETHER THAT'S THROUGH AN FTE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, THEN WE HAVE REALLY CLEARED THE WAY FOR OTHER COMMUNITIES WITH A LOWER HURDLE, FOR EXAMPLE, LIKE WITH COMMUNITY SOLAR, TO ENGAGE, AND THAT IS ONE OF THE REAL BENEFITS TO, AS YOU DESCRIBED, THE GREATER MOVEMENT TO GO TOWARD CARBON NEUTRALITY. THE OTHER -- I'LL JUST MAKE ONE OTHER POINT FROM A COMMENT THE TWO OF YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT A MOMENT AGO, ON STAFFING, AN ELEMENT OF WHAT DR. STULTS IS DOING IS -- DOES REQUIRE SOME FTEs, BUT AS SHE AND I HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS, WE HAVE A NEED TO NOT JUST BE AN OSI DEPARTMENT BUT A NEED FOR THIS WORK TO BE INSTITUTIONALIZED. SO WHEN SHE TALKS ABOUT OTHER CITIES, PART OF IT IS HAVING SUSTAINABLE RESILIENT CONCEPTS BUILT INTO THE WAY THAT WE DO BUSINESS, AND THAT IS A PART OF WHAT SHE IS INTENDING TO DO. IN ASKING FOR INCREMENTAL RESOURCES, SHE'S ASKING DO I NEED TO DO THIS, CAN I SHARE THIS WITH SOMEONE ELSE, THAT KIND OF THING.
01:36:12.190: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
01:36:13.325: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  THANKS, AGAIN, MR. MAYOR, AND THANKS AGAIN DR. STULTS. JUST A QUICK COMMENT, AND THEN ONE FOLLOW-UP QUESTION, MAYBE TWO. COMMENT, THIS GETS TO THIS $1 BILLION, YOU KNOW, MATTER, I WILL JUST SAY, IT IS ONE THING TO SAY THE COST IS $1 BILLION, BUT WE NEED TO SAY -- AND THIS IS WHY I ASKED ABOUT THIS BREAKDOWN BY ENTITY, WE NEED TO SAY HOW MUCH OF THAT IS BORNE BY THE CITY GOVERNMENT, BY RESIDENTS, BY BUSINESSES, BY AAATA, BY THE U OF M, ET CETERA, FOR THE COST NUMBERS TO HAVE ANY MEANING. AGAIN, THAT'S WHY I ASKED FOR THAT BREAKDOWN, AND I APPRECIATE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO PROVIDE THAT. THANK YOU. AND THEN ALSO TO COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER'S QUESTION ABOUT HOW TO PRIORITIZE, YOU KNOW, IF YOU LOOK AT YOUR -- AND, AGAIN, THANKS FOR ALL OF THIS GREAT INFORMATION AND WORK. ON YOUR SLIDE 21, YOU SHOWED THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS BY STRATEGY, AND THEN ON SLIDE 23, YOU SHOWED THE COSTS, AND MY TAKEAWAY IS THERE'S OBVIOUSLY A WIDE DISPARITY IN COST-BENEFIT OF STRATEGIES, AND SO, OBVIOUSLY, WE NEED TO PRIORITIZE, I WOULD JUST SAY ON THAT FRONT. SO THE QUESTION, IN ANOTHER RESPONSE THAT YOU PROVIDED, YOU -- AND I THINK YOU MENTIONED THIS AGAIN TONIGHT, THAT THE FUNDING PLAN FOR ALL OF THIS IS STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT AND INCLUDES A NUMBER OF POTENTIAL RESOURCES, INCLUDING A PROPERTY TAX MILLAGE. YOU MENTIONED THERE'S STILL A WAYS TO GO BEFORE KNOWING WHAT THE MILLAGE ASK WOULD BE, AND THAT'S FAIR, CERTAINLY, BUT YOU ALSO INDICATED THAT THE PLAN WOULD BE TO INCORPORATE OR PARTNER WITH AAATA ON THEIR MILLAGE REQUEST. I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD ELABORATE ON WHAT PARTNERING WITH OR COORDINATING WITH AAATA MEANS, AND IF YOU COULD ALSO SHARE TONIGHT OR LATER WHAT WE MAY KNOW ABOUT THE AAATA MILLAGE, THE TIMING OR SIZE, THE REGIONAL TRANSIT AUTHORITY MILLAGE TIMING OR SIZE, AND WHEN THE CITY WOULD PLAN TO PLACE A LOCAL MILLAGE ON THE ANN ARBOR BALLOT.
01:38:40.171: >> YEAH, GREAT QUESTIONS. TOM, I'M JUST QUEUEING YOU UP, BECAUSE I THINK YOU PROBABLY HAVE MORE INSIGHT THAN ME ON WHEN MILLAGES AND THE AMOUNTS FOR THE DIFFERENT ENTITIES MIGHT COME FORWARD. IN TERMS OF THE COORDINATION, THOUGH, WE HAVE HAD A FEW IN-DEPTH CONVERSATIONS WITH AAATA, THE RIDE, TO UNDERSTAND HOLISTICALLY WHAT THE ASK IS, BECAUSE A LOT OF THE ASK IS FOR PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE AROUND TRANSIT AND TRANSPORTATION WITHIN THE CITY OR REGIONALLY. THAT CONVERSATION HAS LAID BEAR THAT, RIGHT NOW, THEY DON'T HAVE THE FUNDING TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THESE IMPROVEMENTS, AND SO REALLY ONE THING THAT I THINK IS VALUABLE FROM A FRAME PERSPECTIVE IS WHEN WE DID THE FINANCING, WE TALKED ABOUT WHAT MONEY WOULD BE NEEDED, AND TO YOUR POINT, I THINK YOU'RE REALLY PUSHING US IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION TO OUTLINE WHO WOULD HAVE TO COME UP WITH ALL OF THOSE DIFFERENT RESOURCES. BUT WE FOCUSED ON WHAT'S THE ADDITIONAL INCREMENTAL COST THAT WOULD BE NEEDED, AND SO THE RIDE PLAYS A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN THAT. WE HAVE STARTED THE CONVERSATION. WE ARE GETTING ALL OF THE MATH TOGETHER TO REALLY UNDERSTAND. WE ARE WORKING MORE ON THE TECHNICAL, YOU KNOW, HOW MANY BUSSES CAN THEY BRING IN, WHERE CAN THEY GO, HOW CAN WE FUND THE SOLAR IF WE ARE GOING TO POWER THE BUSSES WITH SOLAR, WHAT KIND OF BATTERY STORAGE, HOW LONG ARE THOSE BUSSES. TO COUNCILMEMBER EATON'S POINT, HOW MANY BUSSES MIGHT HAVE WE TO BRING IN. SO WE ARE IN THAT PHASE OF THE ANALYSIS, AND WE DID THE MODELING AS PART OF THE PLAN. NOW WE ARE DOING THE REFINEMENT. SO I DON'T HAVE SPECIFICITY ON THE MILLAGE. I'M GOING TO KICK IT OVER TO --
01:40:06.724: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  BEFORE YOU DO THAT, SORRY, BUT IN -- RELATED TO AAATA, SO I WAS SURPRISED BY THE RESPONSE THAT INDICATED THAT AAATA HAS NO PLANS FOR ELECTRIC BUSSES UNTIL 2035. SO IF THAT'S RIGHT, YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW, WHAT WOULD AAATA'S MILLAGE REQUEST BE FOR?
01:40:30.949: >> TOM, DO YOU WANT TO TAKE THIS ONE?
01:40:34.319: >> WELL, YOU KNOW, I THINK THE IDEA OF GOING TO THE TAXPAYERS AND ASKING FOR A MILLAGE REQUEST FROM A CITY PERSPECTIVE, NOT NECESSARILY FROM THE AAATA PERSPECTIVE, IS REALLY TOO EARLY ON FOR THAT. STAFF IS NOT LOOKING TO, SAY, BECOME FIRST TO TAXPAYERS FOR A MILLAGE. WE ARE LOOKING FIRST TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO LEVERAGE PARTNERSHIPS AND FIND OTHER MONEYS. I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER, BECAUSE I THINK THE NATURE OF WHAT WE WANT TO ATTACK FIRST AND WHAT'S FEASIBLE FIRST, AS YOU I THINK ASTUTELY IDENTIFIED, WE HAVE GOT TO PRIORITIZE THESE THINGS. THE IDEA OF -- AAATA, I HAVE NOT TALKED TO THEM. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEIR PLANS ARE FOR A MILLAGE, AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I COULD FOLLOW UP ON.
01:41:25.203: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  THANKS. OKAY. THANKS.
01:41:27.038: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS? WELL, FOR MY PART, I WOULD -- YOU KNOW, WE HAVE HAD COMMUNICATIONS ONLINE AND OFFLINE, AND I WOULD JUST LIKE TO ECHO WHAT HAS BEEN SAID HERE TODAY TO DR. STULTS AND THE REST OF HER TEAM AT OSI, AND HONESTLY OTHER PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE ORGANIZATION, AND WHY STOP AT THE ORGANIZATION? WE HAVE AN INCREDIBLE STAFF EFFORT. WE HAVE AN INCREDIBLE COMMUNITY EFFORT, AND THAT HAS RESULTED IN THE PLAN WE HAVE TO DISCUSS TODAY AND TO CONSIDER AT OUR NEXT MEETING. THIS IS OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING OF INCREDIBLE IMPORTANCE. IT IS A BOLD, AMBITIOUS PLAN THAT IS -- THAT LETS US KNOW WHAT WE NEED TO DO IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE WHAT IS AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT COMMUNITY GOAL, AND THAT IS TO ACHIEVE CARBON NEUTRALITY, AND DR. STULTS, YOU'RE SITTING HERE TODAY, AND SO YOU'RE BURYING THE THANKS, BUT I KNOW THAT WE KNOW, AND YOU DO, YOU DESERVE A LARGE PORTION OF IT, BUT THERE ARE SO MANY OTHERS AROUND WHO DESERVE IT AS WELL. AND SO THANKS TO YOU AND THEM. THE WORK IS OUTSTANDING. IT DOES STAFF, THE COMMUNITY, AND THE CITY REAL PROUD. THANKS. ALL RIGHT. WE NOW COME TO PUBLIC COMMENT GENERAL TIME. PUBLIC COMMENT GENERAL TIME IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO SPEAK TO COUNCIL AND THE COMMUNITY ABOUT MATTERS OF MUNICIPAL INTEREST.
