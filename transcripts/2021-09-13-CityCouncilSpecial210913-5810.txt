00:00:13.849: >> Mayor Taylor: HE WAS A MOMENT AGO.
00:00:16.185: >> Clerk Beaudry: WE DO HAVE A QUORUM.
00:00:19.187: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU MAY I HAVE A MOTION TO APPROVE THE AGENDA MOVED BY GRISWOLD AND SECONDED BY AR RADINA. DISCUSSION A OF THE AGENDA. DC-1, INTERIM CITY ADMINISTRATOR SEARCH PROCESS. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD, AND SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER EYER. DC-1, MR. POSTEMA, DO YOU WANT TO LEAD US OFF?
00:00:48.550: >> City Atty. Postema: YES. FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE COUNCIL AND PUBLIC, YOU ASKED ME TO A DO A NUMBER OF THINGS AND BY COUNCIL RESOLUTION, TWO WEEKS AGO, WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF MR. EARL, FROM A RECRUITMENT INFORMATION, GOV HR, I BROUGHT TO THE ADMIN COMMITTEE TWO WEEKS AGO, A LIST OF POSSIBLE INTERIM CANDIDATES. THESE INTERIM CANDIDATES RANGED FROM CANDIDATES WHO HAD EXPERIENCE IN SMALLER CITIES, CITIES LESS THAN THE SIZE OF ANN ARBOR AND ONE LARGER. AT THAT MEET, THERE WAS AN INTEREST IN THE COUNCIL. IN THE ADMIN COMMITTEE, ABOUT HAVING INPUT OR AN OPTION WITH A CANDIDATE THAT HAD MORE EXPERIENCE IN A CITY MUCH LARGER THAN ANN ARBOR. AND MR. EARL, DID HAVE CONTACT, PRIOR CONTACT WITH A CANDIDATE THAT FIT THAT DESCRIPTION AND SO A RANGE OF AN DATES WERE DISCUSSED AT THE LAST ADMIN MEETING. AND A RESOLUTION CAME OUT OF THAT MEETING WITH TWO POSSIBLE CANDIDATES, ONE WITH BIG CITY EXPERIENCE THAT IS MR. MILTON DOHONEY, AND ANOTHER CANDIDATE WHICH WAS PETER BUCHARD WHO HAD EXPERIENCE, PRIOR EXPERIENCE OF A CITY IN ILLINOIS, NAPERVILLE, LARGE -- A LITTLE LARGER THAN ANN ARBOR. SO THOSE WERE THE CANDIDATES WE BROUGHT FORWARD TO LOOK AT THOSE CANDIDATES AND FURTHER EVALUATE WHETHER THERE WOULD BE A FIT WITH THE COUNCIL. OBVIOUSLY THAT WOULD ENTAIL A PROCESS OF INTERVIEWING WITH THE COUNCIL IN A PUBLIC INTERVIEW AND SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT PERHAPS INPUT FROM LEADERSHIP OR OTHER STAFF DURING THIS TIME PERIOD. IF YOU HAD A PREFERENCE FOR ONE CANDIDATE, WHETHER YOU WOULD HAVE TO INTERVIEW MORE THAN ONE CANDIDATE, AND THE ANSWER TO THAT IS NO. AND CERTAINLY IF THERE IS AN INTEREST IN HAVING A CANDIDATE WHO CAME FROM A LARGER PLACE, THAT COULD BE DETERMINED AT THIS POINT OR IF YOU WERE LOOKING FOR A CANDIDATE THAT CAME FROM A SIMILAR SIZE, THAT CAN CERTAINLY BE A CONSIDERATION. AND SO THE SEARCH PROCESS -- I KNOW THERE WAS A QUESTION ABOUT THAT. THE SEARCH PROCESS IN PART WOULD DEPENDING ON WHETHER OR NOT YOU WERE MOVING FORWARD WITH TWO OR ONE CANDIDATE, AND I CAN ADDRESS THAT AT A LATER TIME, BUT FROM THE ADMIN COMMITTEE, YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU, TWO RESUMES. AND I APPRECIATE THE WORK OF MR. EARL IN IDENTIFYING THESE CANDIDATES, FROM ALL ACROSS THE UNITED STATES, AND IN MICHIGAN. AND THESE ARE THE TWO WE BROUGHT FORWARD TO THE COUNCIL TONIGHT TO DISCUSS A POSSIBLE INTERIM EXTERNAL CANDIDATE. THANK YOU.
00:04:22.231: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MR. POSTEMA. MR. EARL, ARE YOU KEEN TO SAY SOMETHING? DO YOU HAVE -- OR ARE YOU HERE FOR QUESTIONS?
00:04:33.108: >> I'M HERE FOR QUESTIONS BUNT I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY THAT WE'RE HAPPY TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR AND TO PRESENT YOU WITH CANDIDATES THAT WE FEEL ARE ESTABLISHED LOCAL GOVERNMENT PROFESSIONALS AND CAN ASSIST THE CITY IN THIS INTERIM PERIOD FOR YOU.
00:04:53.795: >> Mayor Taylor: EXCELLENT. THANK YOU. FOR MY PART, I'M GRATEFUL FOR THE WORK DONE BY MR. EARL, YOU AND YOUR GROUP, AND OF COURSE THE CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE THROUGH MR. POSTEMA. IT HAS BEEN INVALUABLE UP AND DOWN THE LINE. I DISTRIBUTED TO MS. BEAUDRY TWO PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE RESOLUTION BEFORE. ONE WHICH I SUSPECT WILL REQUIRE A LITTLE CONVERSATION. THE OTHER PERHAPS A LITTLE MORE SO, MS. BEAUDRY, YOU HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FORWARD THOSE YET?
00:05:36.304: >> Clerk Beaudry: I'M SENDING THEM RIGHT NOW.
00:05:38.273: >> Mayor Taylor: I TEND TO NOT OFFER AMENDMENTS. WHAT I WOULD ASK IS IF SOMEONE COULD OFFER THE SECOND AMENDMENT FIRST, THAT IS AS MR. POSTEMA INDICATED, THE ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE LIMITED NOT BY I THINK INTENTION BUT BY NOMENCLATURE, LIMITED STAFF REVIEW TO THE EXECUTIVE TEAM BUT IT SEEMS TO ME WE SHOULDN'T WESTBOUND SO CONSTRAINING AND -- BE SO CONSTRAINING AND WE SHOULD GIVE OTHER PEOPLE TO ENGAGE. I WOULD ASK FOR AN AMENDMENT TO A THIRD BULLET TO THE SEPTEMBER 13-TO 23, A PROVISION FOR STAFF PARTICIPATION AND INVOLVEMENT. MA I HAVE A MOTION, PLEASE? MOVED BY RADINA AND SECONDED BY GRAND. IS THAT FRIENDLY TO THE BODY? COUNCILMEMBER, ARE YOU LOOKING TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
00:06:45.707: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IN EXACT DETAIL WHAT THAT PROCESS WOULD BE AND I KNOW WE ARE UNDER A TIME CRUNCH OF SORTS AND IF MAYBE WE CAN HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF WHAT THE TIMELINE IS OF THAT PROCESS AND WHAT THE PROCESS WOULD BE IN A NUTSHELL. SO JUST HAVE BETTER COMFORT WITH APPROVING THIS AMENDMENT.
00:07:18.206: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. POSTEMA, DO YOU WANT TO SUPPLEMENT?
00:07:20.275: >> City Atty. Postema: YES, I THINK THE PROCESS COULD BE LEFT TO INPUT FROM THE ADMIN COMMITTEE TOMORROW, FOR EXAMPLE. AND ANY INPUT FROM THE ASSISTANCE THE ACTING CITY MANAGER. IT WOULD ACTUALLY BE A ZOOM-TYPE CERTNLY THE EXECUTIVEEAM AND OF T COUNC T HAVE SOMEIRE ABILY TOEET THE INDIVIDUAL OR INDIVIDUALS AND HAVE SOME UNDERSTANDING. THE IDEA WOULD BENEFIT BOTH THE CANDIDATES TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HAVE HERE IN THE CITY, BOTH AS A COUNCIL, AN EXECUTIVE TEAM AND STAFF INTEREST AND IT WOULD BE PROBABLY A QUESTION-AND-ANSWER OVER ZOOM AND THAT COULD BE SET UP BY OUR H.R. DIRECTOR AND PROVIDE ANY FEEDBACK TO THE COUNCIL THAT YOU WISH HAVE TO HAVE. THAT COULD BE DISCUSSED MORE FULLY TOMORROW AT THE ADMIN COMMITTEE IF YOU LIKE, BUT THAT'S THE GENERAL SENSE. AND IT COULD BE DONE PROMPTLY AND EFFICIENTLY OVER THE NEXT TEN DAYS OR EIGHT DAY,S WHATEVER. TAME COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD, IS YOUR HAND UP FOR THIS PURPOSE?
00:08:53.234: >> Councilmember Griswold:  IT WAS FOR A GENERAL COMMENT, NOT FOR THIS AMENDMENT.
00:08:57.572: >> Mayor Taylor: OKAY. THANK YOU. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, I LOWERED YOUR HAND IN THE ORDINARY COURSE, DID YOU RERAISE IT?
00:09:07.382: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I DID. AND I JUST -- I APPRECIATE MR. POSTEMA'S EXPLANATION OF WHAT THE POSSIBILITIES ARE. I WOULD HAVE MORE COMFORT IN SUPPORTING THIS IF I KNEW EXACTLY WHAT THAT PRESCRIPTION WAS AT THIS POINT. I WON'T -- I DON'T THINK I WILL UPHOLD THE PROCESS HERE IN VOTING FOR IT, BUT I WOULD RATHER HAVE THESE THINGS NESHED OUT MORE -- FLESHED OUT MORE BEFORE THEY COME TO THE FLOOR.
00:09:38.412: >> INTERPRETER: WELL, I MEAN, LET ME --
00:09:40.916: >> City Atty. Postema: WELL, LET ME FLESH IT OUT. AS TO THE EXACT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS THAT ARE GOING TO BE ASKED, THAT'S NOT BEEN DONE, BUT IT WOULD BE IN A QUESTION-AND-ANSWER FORMAT AND IT WOULD BE RELEVANT THINGS THAT WOULD CERTAINLY FOR THE COUNCIL, THOSE THINGS MIGHT -- THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO YOU TO GET AN UNDERSTANDING AND FURTHER INPUT FROM THE LEADERSHIP TEAM AND NOW THE STAFF-ADDED PORTION. SO AS TO THE EXACT QUESTIONS THAT ARE GOING TO BE ASKED, THAT -- THAT WAS NOT BROUGHT FORWARD TO YOU, IN PART BECAUSE THAT COULD BE FLESHED OUT VERY EASILY DEPENDING ON NUMBER ONE, IF YOU HAVE ONE OR TWO CANDIDATES AND SECOND NOW YOU HAVE ADDED THE STAFF. AND SO THE EXACT NATURE OF THOSE QUESTIONS MIGHT DEPENDING ON INPUT WE HAVE HERE TONIGHT FROM THE COUNCIL OR FURTHER FROM THE ADMIN COMMITTEE. SO IT'S SIMILAR TO THINGS WE HAVE DONE IN THE PAST AS TO THE FORMAT. AS TO THE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS, IT WOULD DEPEND ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS.
00:11:02.997: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU.
00:11:05.500: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
00:11:06.301: >> Councilmember Nelson:  MY SUPPORT OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT OR I SHOULD SAY THE SECOND AMENDMENT DEPENDS VERY MUCH THEN THE NATURE OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT. ITS NOT CLEAR TO ME WHAT THE RESULT OF A SURVEY WOULD BE IF YOU ONLY HAVE ONE CANDIDATE. WHAT DO YOU SEE FORESEE AS THE FALLBACK OPTION? I GUESS I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE PURPOSE OF A SURVEY IS IF YOU ONLY HAVE ONE OM?
00:11:41.536: >> INTERPRETER: THAT'S EXACTLY MY POINT ON THE ISSUE OF WHAT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE IF THERE WERE TWO CANDIDATES, IT WOULD BE SOMEWHAT COMTEARTIVE, I BELIEVE OR AT LEAST A RATING OF SOME SORT, BUT THERE'S ONE CANDIDATE, IT WOULD BE MUCH DIFFERENT AND IT WOULD BE MORE IN LINE WITH A -- I DON'T WANT TO SAY A MEET-AND-GREET, BUT AN OPPORTUNITY TO UNDERSTAND THE ATTRIBUTES THE CANDIDATE AND IT WOULD GIVE THE CANDIDATE AN OPPORTUNITY TO UNDERSTAND THE PRESENT CONCERNS OF THE COUNCIL, THE LEADERSHIP TEAM AND WHATEVER STAFF WAS DEEMED APPROPRIATE TO BE THERE.
00:12:25.780: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I DON'T WANT TO -- WE ARE ANTICIPATING MAKING INDEFICIT T --INDEFINITE THE CURRENT ARRANGEMENT. TO ONLY HAVE ONE OPTION, AND SAY, OKAY THE PATH FORWARD IS ACCEPT OR REJECT. AND SO THAT -- AM I MISUNDERSTANDING?
00:12:51.339: >> City Atty. Postema: IT DEPENDS HOW YOU -- HOW YOU DID THAT. IF, IN FACT, YOU WITH ONE CANDIDATE, INITIALLY, AND FOR SOME REASON, THERE WAS NOT A FIT THERE, THERE IS NO PROHIBITION FOR YOU TO GO TO A THEN SECOND CANDIDATE. THIS IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN A PERMANENT RESEARCH IN THAT SOME OF THESE CANDIDATES, THIS IS WHAT THEY ARE DOING ON AN INTERIM BASIS. THIS IS WHAT THEY -- IT IS NOT THAT IF YOU DID NOT SELECT THEM, I'M NOT INTERESTED IN BEING, QUOTE, A SECOND CANDIDATE. YOU HAVE A NUMBER OF OPTIONS AFTERWARDS.
00:13:36.718: >> Councilmember Nelson: OKAY. THANK YOU.
00:13:39.387: >> City Atty. Postema: I DON'T THINK YOU WOULD BE LIMITED TO -- WHEN YOU SAY THE STATUS QUO, YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT -- BECAUSE THE PURPOSE OF THIS EXERCISE IS TO GET AN INTERIM EXTERNAL CANDIDATE. IF YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE STATSTATUS QUO, WE DON'T HAVE AN EXTERNAL CANDIDATE. I THINK THAT'S COMPLETELY UP TO THE COUNCIL.
00:14:05.814: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I APOLOGIZE. I HAVE A REALLY POOR CONNECTION. SO I MIGHT HAVE MISSED THIS. SO HERE DOWN TO ONE CANDIDATE AND HOW DID THIS COME TO BE? THROUGH THE RESOLUTION? DID ONE OF OF THE CANDIDATES WITHDRAW?
00:14:21.896: >> Mayor Taylor: NO. MR. POSTEMA.
00:14:23.631: >> City Atty. Postema: WE ARE NOT DOWN TO ONE CANDIDATE AT ALL. AT THIS POINT, THE ADMIN COMMITTEE BROUGHT YOU TWO CANDIDATES FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. AND THE PROPOSED RESOLUTION HAS YOU INTERVIEWING BOTH CANDIDATES WITH A PROCESS, IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANTED TO DO AND THAT CAME FORTH FROM THE -- FROM THE ADMIN COMMITTEE. BUT CERTAINLY, THERE'S NO PROHIBITION, AND I THINK IT WAS WISE --
00:14:46.488: >> City Atty. Postema: I'M SPEAKSPEAKING --
00:14:50.057: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I'M SPEAKING TO AMENDMENT. THE AMENDMENT SAYS THAT THERE WAS ONLY ONE.
00:14:55.897: >> Mayor Taylor: THE AMENDMENT IS NUMBER TWO, AND THAT IS TO ADD A THIRD BULLET, A PROCESS FOR STAFF PARTICIPATION.
00:15:01.269: >> Councilmember Hayner:  WHAT IS NUMBER ONE?
00:15:04.505: >> Mayor Taylor: THAT IS DRAFT TEXT AND I HAVE NOT YET ASKED FOR IT TO BE BROUGHT FORWARD.
00:15:09.310: >> Councilmember Hayner: OKAY.
00:15:17.285: >> Mayor Taylor: DO YOU HAVE FURTHER QUESTIONS.
00:15:21.423: >> Councilmember Hayner:  NO. SO WE ARE VOTING ON THE ADDITION OF A BULLET POINT?
00:15:24.892: >> Mayor Taylor: THAT'S CORRECT. COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
00:15:36.904: >> Councilmember Griswold:  AS A MEMBER OF THE ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE, I THOUGHT WE HAD AN EXCELLENT PROCESS. MR. EARL EXCEEDED ALL OF MY EXPECTATIONS. WE ENDED UP WITH TWO CANDIDATES, BOTH EXCEPTIONAL CANDIDATES AND SO I'M TROUBLED BECAUSE THE SECOND AMENDMENT THAT WOULD REQUIRE STAFF PARTICIPATION AND INVOLVEMENT, I WOULD DEFINITELY SUPPORT THAT IF THERE ARE CANDIDATES THAT WE ARE GETTING FEEDBACK FROM. IIF WE HAVE JUST ONE CANDIDATE, IT SEEMS INSINCERE TO GO THROUGH A LENGTHY INTERVIEW PROCESS WHEN THERE'S WON'T ONE. SO I GUESS I WILL SPEAK MORE TO THE FIRST AMENDMENT WHEN IT'S ON THE TABLE.
00:16:30.925: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCIL MEMBER RAMLAWI.
00:16:33.093: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I MAKE A MOTION TO POSTPONE THE SECOND AMENDMENT UNTIL THE FIRST AMENDMENT IS DISCUSSED. AFTER THE VOTE ON THE FIRST. I WOULD LIKE TO POSTPONE THIS AMENDMENT UNTIL WE DISCUSS THE OTHER ONE.
00:16:49.477: >> Mayor Taylor: FOR -- YOU KNOW, FOR MY PART, THE FIRST AMENDMENT IS THE DIRECTION I THINK WE OUGHT TO GO. I'M COMFORTABLE WITH IT. I THINK THAT THE GENTLEMAN'S QUALIFICATIONS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES. IF IT'S GOING TO BE A SUBJECT OF CONTROVERSY, THIS IS NOT AN ISSUE THAT I THINK WE REALLY NEED TO TOO MUCH CONVERSATION OVER. I'M CONTENT NOT TO HAVE IT BROUGHT, ALTHOUGH I THINK IT WAS.
00:17:26.948: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  SO ARE YOU WITHDRAWING THE OTHER AMENDMENT?
00:17:32.754: >> Mayor Taylor: WELL, THE AMENDMENT HAS NOT BEEN PROVIDED. MORE ACCURATELY, THE AMENDMENT HAS NOT BEEN MOVED OR SECONDED. THERE'S NO AMENDMENT. THERE'S A TEXT THAT HAS BEEN DELIVERED TO YOU, WHICH I THINK IS USEFUL. BECAUSE IT'S NOT AN AMENDMENT BECAUSE IT'S NOT MOVED OR SECONDED. SO THERE IS NO AMENDMENT AIRPORT TO REDUCING THE NUMBER OF INTERVIEWS FROM TWO TO ONE.
00:17:59.013: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  SO THEN I MOVE --
00:18:01.582: >> Mayor Taylor: I DON'T I NEEDO HAVE IT BROUGHT FORWARD, BUT --
00:18:15.062: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  IS THERE A SECOND TO MY MOTION TO POSTPONE THE AMENDMENT ON THE FLOOR?
00:18:24.305: >> Mayor Taylor: SECONDED BY COUNCICOUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
00:18:34.615: >> Mayor Taylor: UNTIL WHEN?
00:18:35.449: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: WITHOUT MATERIAL RELEVCE --
00:18:40.888: >> Mayor Taylor: I DON'T THINK WE CAN POSTPONE AMENDMENTS WITHIN A MEETING. THE AMENDMENT IS ON THE FLOOR. YOU CAN POSTPONE THE MATTER I ITS EIRELY. I DON'T THINK YOU CAN POSTPONE A SPECIFIC AMENDMENT PENDING SOME OTHER CONVERSATION THAT MAY OR MAY NOT EXIST.
00:19:00.441: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THEN I POSTPONE THE WHOLE MATTER UNTIL THE NEXT COUNCIL MEETING ON THE 20th.
00:19:05.913: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE A SECOND? POSTPONEMENT DIES FOR WANT OF A SECOND. COUNCILMEMBER RADINA. ON THE AMENDMENT.
00:19:18.559: >> Councilmember Radina: THANK YOU. I GUESS I'M -- I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT I GUESS A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE STRUGGLE HERE. FOR ME, THIS -- I AM INTERESTED IN HEARING THE STAFF FEEDBACK REGARDLESS OF THE NUMBER OF CANDIDATES. YOU KNOW, I THINK WHETHER OR NOT IT'S A COMPARATIVE PROCESS, I MEAN, I THINK -- IT COULD BE A COMPARATIVE PROCESS WHERE, FRANKLY, NEITHER CANDIDATE MOVES FORWARD, RIGHT? LIKE, THE OUTCOME WOULD STILL BE THE SAME, WHERE WE CHOOSE TO SELECT ONE. WHETHER WE BRING ONE OR TWO, WE ARE ULTIMATELY LOOKING FOR FEEDBACK ON WHETHER OR NO THAT PERSON WILL, ONE, HAVE THE QUALIFICIONS TO OPERATEHIS EFCTIVELY ONN INTERIM BASIS, THEY WOULD F AND LEAD STAFF IS IMPORTANT TO ME. WHETHER THERE'S MULTIPLE CANDIDATES OR A SINGLE ONE, I THINK -- YOU KNOW, FOR ME, IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO KNOW HOW STAFF FEELS ABOUT THAT CANDIDATE OR A MULTITUDE OF CANDIDATES. SO I WILL SUPPORT THIS AND I'M INTERESTED TO HEAR IF THERE WAS A CONVERSATION MORE ABOUT THE MAYOR'S THINKING ON THAT AS WELL.
00:20:41.342: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS.
00:20:43.110: >> Councilmember Briggs: YES, I WOULD -- I CONCUR WITH EVERYTHING THAT COUNCILMEMBER RADINA JUST SAID IN TERMS OF THE SUPPORTING THIS. THERE'S ONE OR TWO CANDIDATES. I'M ALSO INTERESTED IN GETTING STAFF'S FEEDBACK IN TERMS OF BRINGING IN AN EXTERNAL CANDIDATE AS WELL. I THINK THAT IT IS CHALLENGING -- THERE ARE ASPECTS OF BRINGING AN EXTERNAL CITY ADMINISTRATOR INTERIM THAT AR IT'S WORK FOR STAFF AS WELL. D SO I'M CURIOUS TO -- WITHIN THIS PROCESS, I WILL ALSO GET SOME FEEDBACK FROM THEM ABOUT JUST THAT COMPONENT AS WELL. DOES THERE NEED TO BE A MOTION TO MOVE THIS?
00:21:28.289: >> Mayor Taylor: NO, THERE'S ALREADY BEEN A MOTION. THE AMENDMENT TO ADD THE BULLET, A PROCESS FOR STAFF PARTICIPATION INVOLVEMENT HAS BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED.
00:21:42.069: >> Councilmember Briggs: OKAY. I MISSED THAT. SORRY.
00:21:44.939: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THAT AMENDMENT? ROLL CALL VOTE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER RADINA.
00:22:03.023: >> Councilmember Radina: YES.
00:22:06.961: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
00:22:11.098: >> Councilmember Eyer: YES.
00:22:11.766: >> Councilmember Nelson:  NO.
00:22:15.503: >> Councilmember Briggs: YES.
00:22:16.203: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES.
00:22:20.975: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES.
00:22:25.646: >> Clerk Beaudry: COUNCILMEMBER DISCH, ABSENT.
00:22:30.618: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES.
00:22:32.786: >> Councilmember Song: YES.
00:22:33.454: >> Councilmember Grand: YES.
00:22:34.054: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION CARRIES.
00:22:38.258: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN MOTION AS AMENDED. MY VIEW TO WHAT WE SHOULD DO AND I'M WILLING TO RELENT SO AS TO AVOID CONVERSATION, CONTROVERSY THAT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT WE NEED. SO ALTHOUGH THAT LANGUAGE WAS DISTRIBUTED, I'M CERTAINLY NOT ASKING FOR IT TO BE BROUGHT FORWARD AT THIS TIME. I GUESS I WOULD SAY IN THAT CONTEXT THAT I'M EXCITED ABOUT THIS PROCESS. I BELIEVE THAT WE WILL HAVE THIS PROCESS BE ABLE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONs WITH INTERIM CANDIDATES AND THAT THE INTERIM CANDIDATE THAT WE SELECT WILL BE A PERSON WHO WILL BE ABLE TO -- IN THE EVENT THAT ALL PARTIES ARE IN AGREEMENT, THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO HELP MOVE THE CITY FORWARD TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES TO THAT RESIDENTS EXPECT AND TO I CONTINUE TO LEAD THE WORKFORCE IN A WAY THAT MOVES IT FORWARD. COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD?
00:23:47.661: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES, I THINK THAT WE WOULD BE VERY FORTUNATE IF WE WERE ABLE TO RETAIN EITHER ONE OF THESE CANDIDATES AND GIVE THAN THEY ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, ONE OF MY CONCERNS IS THAT IF THIS GOES OVER TOO LONG A PERIOD, WE MAY LOSE BOTH OF THEM. SO I HAVE A QUESTION FOR MR. EARL, IN TERMS OF HOW CONCERNED SHOULD WE BE WITH THIS TWO-WEEK TIMING? AND DO YOU THINK THAT THE SEPTEMBER 27th DATE FOR THE DECISION IS SOON ENOUGH SO WE SHOULDN'T BE CONCERNED?
00:24:29.537: >> WELL, WE ALWAYS ADVISE THAT THE SOONER THE BETTER. YEAH. HAVING SAID THAT, I DON'T BELIEVE THAT -- OR AT LEAST I'M NOT AWARE THAT ANY ONE OF THE TWO CANDIDATES HAS OTHER PROSPECTS AT THIS POINT.
00:24:45.653: >> Councilmember Griswold: OH, OKAY. THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR. THANK YOU. AND, AGAIN, BOTH OF THEM LOOK EXCEPTIONAL ON PAPER. I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE ARE ABLE TO TALK TO THEM, AND ONE OF MY CONCERNS IS JUST THEIR ENERGY LEVEL AND STAMINA, GIVEN THE CHALLENGES OF ANN ARBOR. SO THANK YOU.
00:25:09.076: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
00:25:11.012: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I JUST HAVE A GENERAL QUESTION, EITHER FOR ADMIN COMMITTEE OR OUR ASSISTANT -- WELL, MR. EARL. SO HOW -- WE'RE GETTING A LIST OF CANDIDATES KIND OF FILTERED THROUGH ADMIN CANDIDATES. HOW MANY CANDIDATES WERE BROUGHT IN AND NOW WE HAVE TWO BEFORE US? I'M CURIOUS HOW MANY, HOW MANY FOLKS WERE BROUGHT IN AND CAN THE REST OF US TAKE A LOOK AT THOSE OTHER APPLICANTS IF WE CHOOSE TO?
00:25:46.914: >> City Atty. Postema: I THINK THE NUMBER BROUGHT TO THE ADMIN COMMITTEE WAS A TOTAL OF FIVE THAT THEY LOOKED AT AND I KNOW MR. EARL HAD A NUMBER OF OTHER CANDIDATES, BUT HE BROUGHT FOUR CANDIDATES FROM HIS GROUP. HE CAN SPEAK TO THAT AND THERE WAS ONE OTHER THAT WAS RECOMMENDE BY -- BY DAN GILL MARTIN OF THE THE MICHIGAN LEAGUE AND WHO MR. EARL ALSO KNEW COINCIDENTALLY. I BELIEVE THEY CONSIDERED FIVE RESUMES.
00:26:32.359: >> YES, JUST TO ANSWER THAT. WE RECEIVED 35ANDIDATES FROM OUR REQUEST AND WE PRESENTED, AS MR. POSTEMA SAID, PRESENTED FOUR CANDIDATES AFTER VETTING WHAT WE THOUGHT WERE THE CANDIDATES THAT WERE BEST SUITED FOR THE CITY.
00:26:59.053: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
00:27:00.454: >> Councilmember Grand: I JUST WANTED TO ADD IN RESPONSE TO COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER'S QUESTION, I'M HAVING DIFFICULTY REMEMBERING A TIME WHEN WE HAD SO MUCH CONSENSUS ABOUT THE TWO CANDIDATES TO BRING FORWARD. YOU CAN LOOK AT THEM, BUT I REALLY KNOW TO WHAT END THIS WAS REALLY FROM -- FROM ACROSS THE FIVE, JUST A COMPLETE CONSENSUS ON WHO THE TOP TWO CANDIDATES WERE.
00:27:28.182: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I GUESS PUT IT IN PERSPECTIVE. WHEN WE HAD THE TWO NAMES CAME TO US, I DID WHAT THE POLICE CHIEFS OR WHOEVER, WHERE I DID MY OWN RESEARCH ON THEM AND I HAVE TO AGREE THAT BOTH OF THESE CANDIDATES SEEM VERY QUALIFIED AND HAVE THEIR DIFFERENT STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES JUST LIKE -- BUT AS YOU SAID THEY BOTH SEEM LIKE QUALIFIED CANDIDATES. I'M TRYING TO PUT IT IN PERSPECTIVE. WHEN WE HAVE BOARD OF COMMISSION APPLICATIONS, WHICH IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THING, WE HAVE A SYSTEM FOR HOLDING ON TO THAT INFORMATION. I'M WONDERING IF IT'S SOMETHING WE COULD LOOK AT, BUT WE COULD, AND IT WOULD BE OF INTEREST.
00:28:09.456: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD?
00:28:10.924: >> Councilmember Griswold:  TO ADDRESS MR. HAYNER'S QUESTION, THIS IS JUST AN INTERIM POSITION AND I CAN STATE THAT THERE WAS A VAST DIFFERENCE -- THERE WERE LIKE TWO GROUPS. THERE WERE TWO CANDIDATES THAT WERE HIGHLY QUALIFIED BROUGHT SIGNIFICANT EXPERIENCE AND THEN THERE WAS A SECOND GROUPING OF CANDIDATES WHO DIDN'T EVEN COME CLOSE. SO THERE WAS A HUGE GAP BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS. IT WAS VERY EASY FOR ME TO SELECT THESE TWO.
00:28:47.394: >> Councilmember Nelson:  TWO OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SUGGESTED THE POSSIBILITY OF STAFF HAVING THE OPINION OF REJECTING THE CONCEPT OF AN EXTERNAL CANDIDATE ALL TOGETHER. AND IN LIGHT OF THOSE REMARKS, I'M LOOKING AT THE RESOLUTION THAT WE PASSED A MONTH AGO ON AUGUST 16th, WHERE I SEE THAT THE COUNCIL ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDED A SEARCH FOR AN EXTERNAL INTERIM AND SO I -- WHILE I DO APPRECIATE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION COMMISSION, THAT YOU HAD UNANIMOUS FAVOR TO ONE, AND I ACCEPT THAT, AS A JUDGMENT THAT IT IS OF VALUE. I'M CONCERNED ABOUT REDUCING THE CHOICE TO ONE AND THEN OPENING UP THE BINARY CHOICE OF EITHER THIS OPTION OR NO EXTERNAL CANDIDATE AT ALL. THAT'S WHAT I WAS ALLUDING TO IN MY INITIAL REMARKS AND THEN THEY WERE AFFIRMED BY COUNCILMEMBER RADINA AND BRIGGS' REMARKS. I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTIVE OF REDUCING THIS TO ONE CANDIDATE. IN THE ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE FOUND IT COMPELLING THAT ONE CANDIDATE IS STRONGER, I'M CONFIDENT THAT IN A REVIEW OF STAFF OPINION, THEY ARE LIKELY TO LAND ON THE SAME SIDE, PERHAPS. SO I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING THIS AMENDMENT.
00:30:19.920: >> Mayor Taylor: THERE IS NO AMENDMENT ON THE FLOOR.
00:30:21.789: >> Councilmember Nelson:  SO WE'RE JUST TALKING ABOUT THE MAIN MOTION THEN?
00:30:25.960: >> Mayor Taylor: CORRECT.
00:30:26.527: >> Councilmember Nelson:  OH, OKAY. I APOLOGIZE.
00:30:32.866: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
00:30:33.734: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  IF WE WERE TO DISCUSS THAT AMENDMENT, I AGREE WITH WHAT WAS JUST SAID, B THAT'S NOT THE CASE. I BELIEVE THOSE DECISIONS OUGHT TO BE AND SHOULD BE -- AND WERE MADE IN THE ADMIN COMMITTEE TO THEN GIVE TO THIS BODY, PRIVILEGE TO DISCUSS EVERYTHING, BUT TO COME WITH ONE NAME WOULDN'T BE RIGHT. AND JUST TO GO BACK TO COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER'S QUESTION OF THE NUMBER OF CANDIDATES THAT CAME IN AND WHY ARE WE SEEING WHAT WE ARE SEEING. ONE PRINCIPLE THAT WE TRIED TO FOLLOW IS ANONYMITY OF THE CANDIDATES BEFORE WE MAKE THEIR NAMES PUBLIC, BE SURE THAT THEY ARE THE FOLKS THAT WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT INTERVIEWING AND BRINGING IN. SO TO PROTECT THEIR PRIVACY AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT GOES ALONG WITH SEARCHING FOR A JOB IN THESE CASES. SO AND I WILL AGREE WITH COUNCILMEMBER GRAND THAT THERE S UNANIMOUS SUPPORT ON THESE TWO NAMES. I FEEL FOR OUR COMMUNITY AND COMPLEXITY OF AN ORGANIZATION, THAT THE NAMES BEING BROUGHT FORWARD HAVE THE EXPERIENCE AND THE OTHER NAMES DIDN'T REALLY MEET THAT BAR. SO THEY PROBABLY WERE ALL EXCEPTIONAL IN THEIR OWN WAYS BUT WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD, WE FELT THESE TWO CANDIDATES FIT OUR NEEDS THE BEST.
00:32:08.562: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RADINA.
00:32:09.762: >> Councilmember Radina:HANK YOU, MAYOR. I NTED TO CLARIFY ANY CONFUSION AROUND MY REMARKS EARLIER. I CERTAINLY DID NOT INTENDO REPRESENTHAT STAFFOULD REJECT THEDEA THAT THERE WOULD BE AN EXTERL CANDIDATET ALL. I BELIEVEAIDND WHAT I HOPE TO CLARI I THAT I'MINTEREST I HS PERSPEIVE ON THE CANDATES, WHETHER THERE'S ONE OR A MULTITUDE OF CANDIDATES. AND SHOULD THIS PERSON NOT BE A FIT, WE MAY -- MAY I BELIEVE I SAID -- GO BACK AND LOOK AT THESE OTHER CANDIDATES. JUST BECAUSE THIS MAY OR MAY NOT BE A FIT, IT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S THE CONCLUSION OF THE PROCESS. IS SIMPLY MEANS THAT WE MIGHT HAVE TO LOOK ELSEWHERE. EITHER WAY, I THINK STAFF FEEDBACK IS IMPORTANT ON THAT. WHILE THAT CONVERSATION IS OVERSIDING, I WANTED TO CLARIFY MY REMARKS. I APOLOGIZE IF IT WAS ON MY PART.
00:33:12.526: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS.
00:33:15.295: >> Councilmember Briggs: THANK YOU. FOR MY PART AS WELL, THAT WAS NOT MY INTENT, THOUGH I'M PERHAPS A LITTLE BIT MORE -- I'M SEEKING MORE BROADLY INPUT IN TERMS OF JUST GENERAL STAFF COMMENTS. I THINK IS A GOOD TIME TO GET INPUT. SO I WELCOME MAKING IT BROAD ENOUGH TO GET A BROAD RANGE OF INPUT IN THIS PROCESS.
00:33:40.320: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION ON THE MAIN MOTION? ALL IN FAVOR? OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. WE NOW COME TO PUBLIC COMMENT -- I SHOULD SAY, IT'S APPROVED AND MR. EARL, MR. POSTEMA, THANK YOU.
00:34:02.342: >> City Atty. Postema: I NEED SOME CLARIFICATION ON WHAT YOU APPROVED, BECAUSE YOU ADDED THE THIRD BUT THE DIRECTION, I BELIEVE IN THE MOTION IS FOR THE -- THE PROCESS AND THE SURVEY TO BE DONE, I BELIEVE THROUGH THE ADMIN COMMITTEE AND I THINK THAT -- I THINK WHAT YOU NEEDED TO AMEND FOR THAT IS I'M NOT SURE THAT THE ADMIN COMMITTEE AS TO -- THEY MAY HAVE SOME INPUT AS TO COUNCIL QUESTIONS, BUT I THINK THAT TO THE EXTENT YOU BROADENED IT TO STAFF AND OTHERS, I THINK YOU ACTUALLY SHOULD AMEND THAT THE PROCESS NEEDS TO PROVIDE THAT DIRECTION TO WOHARDO IN H.R. AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT'S ROUNDING UP STAFF, MR. FOURNIER WOULD BE INVOLVED IN THAT ALSO. I THINK RIGHT NOW IT READS -- I DON'T HAVE IT IN FRONT OF ME. I THINK IT READS. I THINK YOU SHOULD PROVIDE DIRECTION HERE. WE ARE MOVING ON A FAST PROCESS AND I DON'T WANT THERE TO BE ANY MISUNDERSTANDING. I MEAN THE ADMIN COMMITTEE TOMORROW IS OBVIOUSLY MEETING, AND THEY CAN PROVIDE SOME INPUT BUT THE ADMIN COMMITTEE PROCESS IS DETERMINED BY THE ADMIN COMMITTEE AND I NEED TO CLARIFY THAT. AND --
00:35:42.375: >> Mayor Taylor: WELL, I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS PARTICULAR ADDITION CHANGES IT. THE SECOND TO LAST RESOLVE CLAUSE WHICH REFERENCES THE ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE SHOULD, INTACT, NEVER MEANT THE ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE BECAUSE WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE -- WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE COORDINATING THE INTERVIEWS. WE ARE NOT GOING TO COORDINATE THE INTERVIEWS WITH STAFF OR ANYTHING SINCE WE DON'T COORDINATE. THAT FROM THE JUMP OUGHT TO HAVE SAID THE CITY'S H.R. DIRECT MR. WOHARDO; IS THAT CORRECT?
00:36:11.171: >> City Atty. Postema: I THINK WHETHER IT OUGHT TO HAVE SAID OR BECAUSE I THINK IT INVOLVED THE -- YOU KNOW, CERTAINLY COUNCIL QUESTIONS, MAY BE INVOLVED WITH THE ADMIN COMMITTEE TO PROVIDE THAT INPUT. I THINK THAT THE -- WHAT COULD BE SAID IS COORDINATED THROUGH THE ADMIN COMMITTEE, H.R., AND/OR -- YOU KNOW, WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF ACTING CITY ADMINISTRATOR. SO SOME LANGUAGE TO CLARIFY THAT OR TO JUST TAKE IT FULLY AND HAVE THAT PROCESS COORDINATED THROUGH H.R. OR WHATEVER ELSE YOU WANT. BUT IF YOU DON'T WANT -- IF YOU DON'T WANT -- IF YOU DON'T WANT ANY INPUT FROM THE ADMIN COMMITTEE ON QUESTIONS, THEN THAT CAN BE CLARIFIED. THAT'S WHY IT WAS PUT IN. IT WAS NOT PUT IN IN ERROR, BUT IT WAS PUT IN TO ALLOW YOU TO EXPLORE THAT. I DO THINK THAT YOU NEED AN ADDITION TO THAT.
00:37:16.569: >> Mayor Taylor: SO THAT PERHAPS THE EVALUATION BE COORDINATED BY THE COUNCIL ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE AND CITY STAFF, INCLUDING THE CITY'S H.R. DIRECTOR, MR. WOHARDO. DO PEOPLE NEED TO SEE THAT IN WRITING?
00:37:39.493: >> Councilmember Griswold: NO.
00:37:42.595: >> Mayor Taylor: WOULD SOMEONE TYPE THAT OUT AND SEND IT AROUND. SO THE AMENDMENT FOR THE SECOND RESOLVE CLAUSE WHICH READS THAT THE EVALUATION PROJECT SHOULD BE COORDINATED BY THE COUNCIL ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE AND --
00:37:56.709: >> City Atty. Postema: AND THE C.H.R. DIRECTOR, THE H.R. DIRECTOR.
00:38:00.112: >> Mayor Taylor: AND THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR H.R. DIRECTOR.
00:38:07.554: >> City Atty. Postema: AND I DO THINK IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO PUT MR. FOURNIER IN BECAUSE HE WILL COORDINATE AT LEAST THE STAFF PARTICIPATION. THE ACTING CITY ADMINISTRATOR AND THE CITY'S H. R. DIRECTOR.
00:38:27.274: >> City Atty. Postema: THAT'S RIGHT.
00:38:29.442: >> Mayor Taylor: HAS THAT BEEN DISTRIBUTED.
00:38:31.077: >> City Atty. Postema: AND I WOULD SUGGEST THAT BOTH OF THEM WILL BE AT THE ADMIN COMMITTEE TOMORROW AND I THINK THAT ANY FURTHER DIRE DIRECTION CAN BE GN TOMORROW.
00:38:42.355: >> Mayor Taylor: EXCELLENT. MAY I HAVE A MOTION TO THAT EFFECT? MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD AND SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER. IS THAT AMENDMENT FRIENDLY TO THE BODY? I'M SEEING NO OBJECTION. THAT AMENDMENT IS FRIENDLY. COUNCILMEMBER GRIZ CALD. -- GRISWOLD.
00:38:59.072: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I JUST WANTED TO ADDRESS THE PROCESS. AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND GET INPUT FROM STAFF, WHICH I THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT, I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT INPUT IS THROUGH A SURVEY DOCUMENT. WE RECEIVED A COUPLE OF EMAILS FROM OUR ACTING CITY ADMINISTRATOR, RESTRICTING COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN STAFF AND COUNCIL, WHICH I FULLY SUPPORT, AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE FOLLOW THOSE GUIDELINES IN THIS HIRING PROCESS.
00:39:36.576: >> City Atty. Postema: YES, IT WOULD BE THROUGH A SURVEY DOCUMENT. THAT'S CORRECT.
00:39:40.080: >> Councilmember Griswold: OKAY. SO WE DON'T WANT STAFF TO CONTACT COUNCILMEMBERS TO PROVIDE INFORMATION?
00:39:45.385: >> City Atty. Postema: THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.
00:39:47.153: >> Councilmember Griswold: THANK YOU.
00:39:55.728: >> Mayor Taylor: I REALIZE THAT WE ALREADY VOTED ON THE RESOLUTION PRIOR TO SEEKING TO AMEND IT.
00:40:01.701: >> City Atty. Postema: WELL, WHAT I WOULD DO IS JUST RECONSIDER IT, OPEN IT AND ADD THAT AS AN AMENDMENT.
00:40:07.207: >> Mayor Taylor: CAN I HAVE A MOTION TO RECONSIDER. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD AND SECONDED BY GRAND. DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? OPPOSED? WE ARE RE -- THE MOTION TO RECONSIDER IS APPROVED DO. WE NEED TO REMOVE THE MOTION, MR. POSTEMA?
00:40:20.987: >> City Atty. Postema: YOU CAN -- YOU CAN REMOVE IT AND THEN THEN ADD THAT LANGUAGE.
