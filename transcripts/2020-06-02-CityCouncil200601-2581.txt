00:02:15.921: >> Mayor Taylor: ALL RIGHT. OTHER AMENDMENTS TO THE AGENDA? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, YOU HAD YOUR HAND UP.
00:02:19.925: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES, THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I WANTED TO POINT OUT TO THE MANY FOLKS WOULD CALLED AND EMAILED AND THE APPROVAL WITH THE AGREEMENT WITH THE POLICE PE OFFICERS HAS BEEN STRICKE FROM THE AGENDA I JUST WANTED T THROW THAT OUT THIS BECAUSE I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT IT. I WANT TO NOTE THAT THAT WAS MISSING AND ALSO, I PUT IN A REQUEST FOR A RESOLUTION TO OVERRIDE THE PARTIAL VETO THAT YOU ISSUED, MR. MAYOR, AND IT WILL NOT APPEAR ON -- I HAD SOME I IT. ON TONIGHT'S AGENDA, BUT I PLAN TO BRING IT BACK. IF WE ACCEPT THE CLERK'S REPORT WITH YOUR VETO IN THAT, IT WILL BE WELL WITHIN THE 30-DAY LIMIT. THANK YOU.
00:03:04.403: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
00:03:05.804: >> FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE AGENDA AS ALTERED? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] ALL OPPOSED? WE HAVE COMMUNICATIS TODAY FROM OUR CITY ADMINISTRATOR?
00:03:22.054: >> City Admin. Crawford: YES, MR. MAYOR, THANK YOU. A COUPLE OF THINGS. I WANTED TO RECOGNIZE CHIEF COX FOR WALKING WITH THE PROTESTERS. SOME HAD THE CONCES WITH POLICE BRUTALITY. AND AS COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER REFERENCED, ON TONIGHT'S AGENDA, THE POLICE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT WAS INCLUDED AS CA-14, THERE WERE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS THAT WERE RAISED AND HOW IT RELATES TO THE NATIONAL DISCUSSION ON POLICE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. WHILE I BELIEVE THAT OUR CONTRACT HAS MANY OF THE BEST PRACTICES INCORPORATED IN, ITT IS IMPORTANTHAT W TAKE THE TIMEO ANSWER QSTIONS WE HAVE RECEIVED IN A PROFESSIONAL MANNER. SO I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THAT IT'S BEEN REMOVED FROM THE MEETING IN THAT IF COUNCILMEMBERS COULD SHARE THEIR QUESTIONS, WITH STAFF THIS WEEK, WE'LL TRY TO RESPOND AND PROVIDE YOUR RESPONSE BY -- BY THE END LASTLY, COUNC PRESENTLY HAS A WORKING SESSION SCHEDULED FOR THIS COMING MONDAY, JUNE 8th. THE MATERIAL FOR THIS MEETING ARE NOT REALLY READY FOR THIS DISCUSSION. I WOULD LIKE TO CANCEL THAT MEETING AND GIVE YOU THAT TIME BACK, IF THAT'S OKAY.
00:04:38.630: >> Mayor Taylor: ANY OBJECTION ON THAT?
00:04:40.399: >> Councilmember Eaton: DO WE NEED TO TAKE ANY PARTICULAR ACON, AOTION OR ANYTHING? OR CONSENT?

00:04:51.743: >> Councilmember Griswold: COULD YOU EXPLAIN WHAT THE ITEMS ARE FOR THE MOBILITY WORK SESSION?
00:04:59.718: >> City Admin. Crawford: THAT'S PART OF THE DISCUSSION. THERE WERE SEVERAL MATERIALS PROVIDED TO COUNCIL OVER THE LAST FOUR TO SIX WEEKS I WOU SAY, AND WHILE STAFF CAN PRESENT ON THOSE MATERIALS, YOU ALREADY RECEIVED THEM. THEY DON'T THINK WE ARE PREPARED TO TAKE THE NEXT STEPS WITH THOSE MATERIALS FOR YOUR DISCUSSION.
00:05:15.500: >> Councilmember Griswold: OKAY. IS THAT LIKE HEALTHY STREETS OR SOMETHING MORE LIKE THE REPORT FROM SAM SCHWARTZ?
00:05:22.975: >> City Admin. Crawford: I WOULD HAVE TO PULL UP THE DETAILS BECAUSE I HAVEN'T ACTUALLY SEEN THE DFT MTION. M SORRY I DON'T HAVE IT HANDY.

00:05:34.252: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, BANNISTER.
00:05:35.887: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  AND DO WE HAVE A DATE CERTAIN OR A DATE SELECTED FOR THAT?
00:05:45.931: >> City Admin. Crawford: YOU MEAN TO HAVE THE MEETING
00:05:47.366: >> Councmemb Ramla: YE.
00:05:48.667: >>ity Admin. Cwford: WE DON'T ATHIS TIME, NO. I CAN CIRCLE BACK WITH THE ADMIN COMMITTEE AND GET THAT ARRANGED.
00:05:58.143: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU.
00:06:01.046: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
00:06:02.147: >> Councilmember Bannister:  I WAS TRYING TO REMEMBER SOME OF THE OTHER TOPICS ON OUR LIST THAT HE WITH WANTED TO HAVE WORKING SESSIONS FOR. I DON'T KNOW MAYBE LIKE IT W ANNEXATIONSR FURTHER GROUP WORK ON OUR A2ZERO PLAN OR -- SO THERE'S NOTHING ON THE LATE LIST THAT WE WANTED TO FILL IN INSTEAD?
00:06:22.100: >> City Admin. Crawford: NOT THAT WE ARE PREPARED TO SPEAK WITH ON THAT SHORT OF NOTICE. TYPICALLY WE WOULD ALREADY HAVE THE MATERIALS PREPARED, AND I HAVE BEEN THROUGH THEM AT THIS POINT. THERE ARE SOME THINGS WEEED T TALK ABOUT, INCLUDING T SOLID WASTE PLAN AND SOME OTHER THINGS LATER IN THE YEAR.
00:06:38.884: >> Councilmember Bannister: THANK YOU.
00:06:44.156: >> Mayor Taylor: I THINK WE ARE OKAY WITH IT BY ACCLAMATION, WITH NO OBJECTION. MR. CRAWFORD, YOU STILL HAVE THE FLOOR.
00:06:50.962: >> City Admin. Crawford: THAT'S ALL. THANK YOU.
00:06:52.230: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU VERY MU. WE N COME T PUBLICOMMENT RESERV TIME. PUBLIC COMMENT RESERVE TIME IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO SPEAK TO COUNCIL AND THE COMMUNITY ABOUT MATTERS OF MUNICIPAL INTEREST. TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT RESERVE TIME, ONE NEEDS TO HAVE SIGNED UP IN ADVANCE BY CONTACTING OUR CITY CLERK. THE PHONE NUMBER AND THE MEETING ID T CALL IN SHOUL BE DISPLAYED ON YOUR SCREEN. CALLERS WILL BE CALLED ON ONE-BY-ONE BY THE CITY CLERK, USING THE LAST THREE DIGITS OF YOUR PHONE NUMBER AND YOU WILL HEAR AN AUTOMATED ANNOUNCEMENT. WHEN YOU ARE SPEAKING PLEASE MOVE TO A QUIET AREA AND MUTE YOUR TV OR ANY BACKGROUND SOUND. THE SPEAKERS HAVEHREE MINES IN WHI TO SPEAK. PLEASE PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO A TIME CLOCK. THE CLERK WILL ANNOUNCE WHEN 30 SECONDS ARE REMAINING FOR YOUR TIME AND WHEN YOUR TIME IS UP, YOU WILL BE -- AFTER THE OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU TO FINISH YOUR SENTENCE, PLACED ON MUTE. WE THANK YOU FOR OBSERVING THE TIME CLOCK. IF YOU ARE NEW TO CITY COUNCIL, PUBLIC COMMENT IS AN OPPORNITY TO PRODEOMMENTSO COUNCIL AND THE COMMUNITY. IT IS NOT AN OPPORTUNITY FOR DIALOGUE BETWEEN PUBLIC AND CITY COUNCIL THAT OCCURS IN OTHER FORUMS. I WOULD LIKE TO -- AS I SEE THAT IT IS THE TOPIC OF A COUPLE OF FOLKS ON OUR PUBLIC COMMENT, I WANT TO CONFIRM OR AGAIN AFFIRM WHAT COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER AND MR. CRAWFORD HAVE BOTH INDICATED, THE CA-14, THE ANN ARBOR POLICE OFFICER AGREEMENT HAS BEEN STRICKEN FROM THE AGENDA AND CONSIDERED AT ANOTHER MEETING. THAT ALL SAID, LET'S MOVE ON WITH PUBLIC COMMENT. OUR FIRST SPEAKER OF PUBLIC COMMENT IS STEVEN HALL.
00:08:52.551: >> TERRIFIC! THANK YOU, EVERYBODY, FOR HAVING ME. MY NAME IS STEVEN HALL. MY WIFE AND I ABBY OLINSK AYE, OWN SPENCER RESTAURAN AND W ARE CALLING TO TALKBOUTHE CLOSING OF STREETS DURING UPCOMING WEEKENDS WHICH WE WOULD LIKE TO OPPOSE. WE SPOKE TO MEMBERS OF THE DDA, THE MAIN STREET ASSOCIATION AND THE MAYOR AND WE HEARD THAT THERE HAVE BEEN MANY PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH MERCHANTS AND RESTAURANT OWNERS AND BUSINESS OWNERS THROUGHOUT DOWNTOWN, HOWEVER, IT SEEMS NO ONE HAS TAKEN AS MUCH TIME TO SPEAK TO THE EMPLOYE OF THESE SINESSES, AND GIVEN THAT THEY FAR OUT NUMBER THE EMPLOYERS, WE WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THEIR SAFETY AND THE DIFFICULT POSITIONS THAT THEY MAY FACE HAVE NOT BEEN FAIRLY CONSIDERED. SO MANY OF THE EMPLOYEES, YOU KNOW, HAVE BEEN LAID OFF OR FURLOUGHED AND FOR THE PAST NUMBER OF WEEKS HAVE BEEN AS FAR ASASAS --FORCED TO NAVIGATE A L. AND WHEN ASKED TO RETURN, THEY HAVE UNCLEAR SAFETY GUIDELINES AND SOCIAL DISTANCING AND THEIR TRAINING AND THEY WILL BE EXPECTED TO ADAPT TO, YOU KNOW, THE INEVITABLE REVISIONS TO THE PROTOLS WITHOUT ANY SORT OF GUARANTS THAT THEY WI HAVE ENOUGH HOURS OR CONSISTENT SCHEDULES TO MAKE AND MEET. SO THEY ARE BEING ASKED TO EXPOSE THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES TO HEALTH RISKS WHILE ALSO POTENTIALLY COMPROMISING THEIR ELIGIBILITY FOR UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS. YOU KNOW, FOR RESTAURANT WORKERS WHO DEPEND ON TIPS WHETHER SERVERSR BARTEER IT'S UNCLEAR -- IT'S ASSUMED THAT THIS NEW SOCIAL DISTANCE SYSTEM WOULD DECREASE THEIR EARNINGS AND THEN FOR BACK OF HOUSE STAFF, MANAGERS AND KITCHEN STAFF, THE IDEA OF PIVOTING BETWEEN CARRYINGOUT SERVICE ON WEEK NIGHTS THAT'S CURRENTLY IN PLACE AND ESSENTIALLY FULL BLOWN SUMMER PATIO MODE MULTIPLE TIMES EACH MONTH TO BOUNCE BACK AND FOH SUCCESSFULLY SEEMS UNREALISTIC WITHOUT MORE SUPPORT OR OVERSIGHT. MORE OVERON LIBERTY STREET, WE WATCH A LOT OF PEOPLE COME OUT RECENTLY NOT WEARING MASKS, NOT OBSERVING SOCIAL DISTANCING GUIDELINES. MEMORIAL DAY WAS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THAT, WHERE PEOPLE REALLY TED AITTLE BIT LES RESPONSIBLY THAN I THINK PEOPLE WOULD HAVE HOPED. AND SO, I THINK IN TALKING ABOUT TRANSITIONING TO REOPENING AND TAKING MEASURES SUCH AS CLOSING THE STREETS.
00:11:29.474: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
00:11:30.475: >> WE SHOULD SERVE THE MOST CAUTIOUS, AT-RISK MEMBERS IN THE COMMUNITY. RESTRANT THAT H NOT CLOSED ANY ADDITIONAL DAYS DURING THE PANDEMIC. WE HAVE FIRED NONE OF OUR STAFF AND SO THIS TEDIOUS, GRUELING TRANSITION THAT WE HAD TO UNDERTAKE, WE DON'T WANT -- WE DON'T WANT UNDERMINED BY AN EXPERIMENT FOR THE PUBLIC THAT, YOU KNOW, IS INTERMITTENT OR UNPREDICBLE. IHINKHAT'S MY TIME. THANK U FOR LISTENING.
00:12:02.540: >> Clerk Beaudry: TIME.
00:12:03.174: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS EVAN REDMOND.
00:12:21.426: >>'M VERY GLAD --
00:12:22.827: >> Clerk Beaudry: GO AHEAD. SORRY.
00:12:25.663: >> MY NAME IS EVAN REDMOND. I LIVE ON WHITEWOOD STREET AND I'M RUNNING FOR ANN ARBOR CITY COUNCIL WARD 3 AND I SIGNED UP TODAY AT 8 A.M. TO SPEAK ON CA-14. SO I'M GLAD IT'S BEEN REMOVED FROM THE CONSENT AGENDA. THE CITY HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO STAND UP AGAINST POLICE VIOLEE IN 24. AND I'M GLAD THAT YOU ALL ARE TRYING AGAIN. SOME PEOPLE LISTENING TO THIS MIGHT NOT HAVE HAD THE TIME TO READ THE PROPOSED COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT. IT'S RATHER LONG. SO I WOULD LIKE TO TELL THEM ABOUT SOME OF WHAT'S INCLUDED IN THIS VERSION. FIRSTLY, INVESTIGATIONS INTO OFFICER MISCONDUCT WILL CONTINUE TO BENTIRELY RUN BY SUPERVISORS IN THE POLICE DEPARTMENT, AND NO OUTSIDE PEOPLE OR AGENCIES ARE PRIVY TO THE FINDINGS, ONLY SEEING WHAT HAPPENS AS A RESULT. AND SECONDLY, NO ELECTED OFFICIALS INCLUDING CITY COUNCILMEMBERS ARE ABLE TO REVIEW PERSONNEL FILES ON A POLICE OFFICER. WHEN THINKING ABOUT PICE OVSIGHT, I TNK OF GRI SCENARIO WHAT IF ANOTHER AURA ROBERTS INCIDENT. WHAT IF AAPD KILLED A CIVILIAN IN 2020. THE ONLY ANSWER I CAN COME UP WITH IS NOTHING WILL BE DIFFERENT. THE FACT THAT THERE'S NO CHANGE ON THIS ISSUE IN FOUR YEARS IS A TOUGH PILL TO SWALLOW, BUT YOU AIFFERENCE NOW.NITY TOAKE THE BIGGEST HISTORICAL OBSTACLE TO THE INDEPENDENT POLICE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION ACTUALLY OVERSEEING THE AAPD IS THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT WITH THE CITY. USUALLY COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS ARE GOOD, BUT NOT WHEN THE POLICE ARE GIVEN THE POWER TO COMMIT CRIMES WITH NO REPERCUSSIONS. IF THE UNION GOES ON STRIKE, I SERISLY DOUBT THE UNIONIZED POLICE OFFICERS WILL BEN THE PICKET LINE HOLDING HANDS SINGING "SOLIDARITY FOREVER." FEW IN THE COMMUNITY KNOW THAT CITY COUNCIL DOESN'T REALLY HAVE RECOURSE OVER THE ANN ARBOR POLICE DEPARTMENT. AND IT'S AN UNDEMOCRATIC BLACK BOX. AND IT'S THE BLANT BURDE O GEORGELOYD IS A LOOK AT THE NATION. NOT ONLY AM I CALLING ON CITY COUNCIL NOT TO ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT, BUT TO PLEDGE NOT TO INCREASE THE POLICE BUDGET AGAIN FOR AS LONG AS THEY ARE IN OFFICE. I WAS REALLY SADDENED LAST YEAR WHEN CITY COUNCIL UNANIMOUSLY AGREED TO INCREASE THE AAPD BUDGET TO SUPPOSEDLY HELP IT WORK BETTER WITH THE IPCOC, BUT HOW MH MORE TRAINING WILL PEOPLE REQUEST OF THEIR POLICE OFFICERS? HOW MUCH MORE MONEY DO WE HAVE TO SPEND BEFORE WE REALIZE THAT POLICING IS A BROKEN INSTITUTION? AND HOW MANY MORE PEOPLE OF COLOR HAVE TO BE KILLED BEFORE WE CUT THEIR FUNDING? SO PLEASE RE RESUM RUMINATEN TSE QUESTIONS RATHER THAN CONTINUING TO FUND GROUPS THAT PROTECT PROPERTY OVER PEOPLE. THANK YOU.
00:15:23.641: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS LANDON SLANGER.
00:15:29.781: >> MAYOR, MR. SLANGER IS NOT ON THE LINE.
00:15:33.818: >> Mayor Taylor: VERY GOOD. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS CNGCHI CHEN.
00:15:39.857: >> HELLO? HELLO?
00:15:41.159: >> Clerk Beaudry: GO AHEAD.
00:15:42.660: >> OKAY. THANK YOU. MY NAME IS CHINGCHI CHEN, AT 2725 NIXON ROAD. THANKS FOR GIVING ME THE CHANCE TO EXPRESS MY OPINION ON CA-8 ABOUATREET A SIDEWALK MILLAGE. TODAY AROUND 6 P.M., JUST BEFORE THIS MEETING, I STOOD IN FRONT OF MY HOUSE TO COUNT HOW MANY PEOPLE WALKED, JOGGED, BIKED, ALONG NIXON ROAD PASSING MY HOUSE. IN FIVE MINUTES, I COUNTED EIGHT. SO IF I STAY THERE LONGER, I'M SURE IAN EASILY COUNT BEYOND 100. UNTOLD HOW MANY TIMES MY FAMILY WILL USE THE NEW SIDEWALK IN FRONT OF MY HOUSE AFTER IT'S BUILT. IT'S OBVIOUS THAT THE NEARBY COMMUNITY WILL BENEFIT FROM IT MUCH MORE THAN THE ADJACENT PROPERTY OWNER LIKE ME. THEREFORE, THE COST OF THE LARGER COMNITY, INSAD OFD BY A PUTTING BIG FINANCIAL BURDENS ON THE ADJACENT PROPERTY OWNERS. THIS VIEW POINT IS ALSO RECOGNIZED BY THE CCE AND THE COUNCIL TO PROPOSE A NEW MILLAGE TO PAY FOR FUTURE NEW STREET/BRIDGE SIDEWALK. WE AEE WITHHE NEW VIEWPOINT. THAT WILL COMPLY WITH THE EXISTING IMPERFECT LAW, AND PAY FOR SUBSTANTIALLY HIGH SPECIAL ASSESSMENT FEE. AND LATER WE ALSO NEED TO SUBSIDIZE FUTURE SIDEWALK PROJECTS BY PAYING A NEW MILLAGE. WE WANT THE CITY AND THEOUIL TO CE UPITH ELOENT SOLUTIONS TO LET US FEEL LIKE WE WILL BE TREATED FAIRLY. THANK YOU.
00:17:36.774: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS MARIN KLUMPNER.
00:17:50.355: >> OH.
00:17:50.722: >> Clerk Beaudry: GO AHEAD.
00:17:51.456: >> MY NAME IS MARIN KLUMPNER AND I LIVE AT 2765 NIXON ROAD AND I HAVE SIMILAR IDEAS AS THE LAST CALLER. I'M NOT MUCH AT PUBLIC SPEAKING SO I HAVE WRITTEN DOWN A COUPLE OF WORDS. I URGE CITY COUNCIL TO BRING THE SIDEWALKS C IMPVE THE MILLAGE COUNITY AND T PROPERTY TAXES ARE A WAY TO SHARE THE COST OF THIS NEW COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT WITHIN THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY. NEW SIDEWALKS SHOULD NOT BE PAID FOR BY SPECIAL ASSESSMENT AS THIS PLACES AN UNDO BURDEN ON PROPERTY OWNERS. PEOPLE EXPECT AND PLAN FOR PROPERTY TAXES AND THE PROPOSED MILLAGE WOULD ONLY ADD A FEW DOLLARS TO MOST INDIVIDUAL PROPERTY TAXES. SLMING HOMEOWNERS WITH SPECIAL ASSESSMENT FEES POSES A DISPROPORTIONATE BURDEN OF A FEW THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO A SELECT FEW. I BELIEVE IT'S NOT AN EQUITABLE TO DEVELOP THE ANN ARBOR COMMUNITY. THIS COUNCIL HAS IDENTIFIED THAT NEW SIDEWALKS TO FILL SIDEWALK GAPS IMPROVEAFETY, ANSPORTATION RECREATIONAL AND GENERAL COMMUNITY HEALTH. THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY WOULD NOT BE THE INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNER. IT'S THE COMMUNITY. SO I WOULD JUST HOPE THAT THE COST WOULD BE SHARED. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
00:19:08.266: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS JULIE LIN.
00:19:20.044: >> 703.
00:19:20.511: >> Clerk Beaudry: GO AHEAD, CALLER 985.
00:19:24.282: >> YES, MY NAME IS JULIE LIN, AND I'M THE OWNER AT 2703 NIXON ROAD AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO LET ME EXPLAIN MY OPINION ON PROSING TO ADD A SIDEWALK MILLAGE TO THE NOVEMBER BALLOT. OPINION NUMBER ONE, I WOULD LIKE TO ENCOURAGE THE COUNCILMEMBERS TO APPROVE AIDING THE MILLAGE FOR A NEW SIDEWALK CONSTRUCTION TO THE NOVEMBER BALLOT ON THE CONDITION THAT THE BALLOT LANGUAGE SHALL INCLUDE THE COST FOR THREE NEW SIDEWALK GAP ELIMINATION PROJECTS ON BUTTERFIELD, NIXON, TRAVER AND JACKSON ROAD. TARGETING A SMALL GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS FOR A PUBLIC BENEFIT, DRIVEN BY THE CITY I INITABLE ANDOESN'T ME SENSE AT ALL. NUMBER TWO, I ALSO APPRECIATE THAT COUNCILMEMBERS RECOGNIZE THAT THE CURRENT USE OF FUNDING SIDEWALK CONSTRUCTION THROUGH SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS OF INDIVIDUAL PROPERTY OWNER IS FLAWED. NUMBER THR, REGRETFULLY THE COCIL HAS RENTLY PASSED ITS VOTE, EVEN IT'S CLEAR THAT THE PROPERTY OWNERS HAVE OBJECTIONS. HOWEVER, GIVEN THE PANDEMIC SITUATION, OVER THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS, THE PROPERTY OWNERS HAVE NOT BEEN GIVEN ADEQUATE OBJECTION.Y TO VOICEHIS NUMBER FOUR, THEREFORE, I WOULD ALSO ASK CITY COUNCIL TO PUT ASIDE ITS DECISION TO ASSESS THE BUTTERFIELD DRIVE, NIXON ROAD, HOMEOWNERS FOR THE PROPOSED SIDEWALK PROJECT UNTIL AFTER THE NOVEMBER BALLOT. NUMBER FIVE, I THE CITY -- IF TH CITY COUNCIL HAS DETERMINED THAT THE SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS ARE INAPPROPRIATE ENOUGH TO ASK FOR MILLAGE, THEN THEY CANNOT IN GOOD CONSCIENCE MOVE FORWARD WITH ASSESSING ONLY THESE PROPERTY OWNERS. THANK YOU.
00:21:49.660: >>ayor Taylor:HANK YOUERY MUCH. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS SYA-UFU MA.
00:21:58.636: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER 701.
00:21:59.537: >> MY NAME IS SYA-UFU MA. I'M HERE TO ADDRESS CA RIFF 8, PROPOSAL FOR SIDEWALK MILLAGE. I HAVE TO SAY IN THE MIDST OF A NDEMIC, AND OTHER ISSUES, I FEEL SILLY TALKING ABOUT A SIDEWALK. IT'S UNFAIR TO ASK MY FAMILY TO SAVE $52,000 TO CONSTRUCT A PROJECT ON OUR VACANT LAND. SIDEWALK WE DON'T EVEN WANT. NEVER MIND OUR ASSESSMENT THAT 8,000, 10,000, $15,000 ASSSMENTS, THE KAUFMANS AND YOGS ARE BNG ASKED TO PAY ARE EQUALLY UNFAIR. I MENTION THE NUMBERS FOR IMPACT BUT THE REAL ISSUE IS THAT THE PRINCIPLE IS FAULTY. ITS NOT LIKE WE GOT A CALL FROM THE CITY SAYING WE CAN GET A GREAT DEAL TO BUILD SIDEWALKS FOR $100 A LINEAR FOOT. THESE ARE NOT FOR OUR INDIVIDUAL BEN FETT BUT FOR THE GOOD OF THE COMMUNITY AND AS SUCH, TO BE WE ARE FORTUNATEO LIVE I A NATION WHERE WE MAY VOICE OUR OBJECTIONS, AS I WATCH OUR COUNTRY LITERALLY GOING UP IN FLAMES I'M REMINDED OF HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO REMAIN CALM AND RESPECTFUL. AS AN ASIAN AMERICAN, IT IS PART OF MY CULTURAL UPBRINGING TO BE RESPECTFUL. I HOPE THAT'S ENOUGH TO BE HEARD. I BESEECH THE MEMBERS OF CITY COUNCILO REEXAMINE THE ORDINANCES FOR THE USE ON TO A HANDFUL OF PROPERTY OWNERS. I'M SORRY THAT PREVIOUS HOMEOWNERS HAD TO PAY PREVIOUS ASSESSMENTS. WE CANNOT REVERSE HISTORY BUT WE CAN MOVE FORWARD TO IMPROVE AND NOT CONTINUE TO MAKE THE SAME MISTAKES. IN THESE UNPRECEDENTED TIMES EN THE GERNMENT HAS ASKED O SITIZENS TOHELTER IN PLACE, TO WEAR MASKS AND TO ABIDE BY CURFEWS IS IT TOO MUCH FOR THE CITIZENS TO ASK OF ITS GOVERNMENTS TO MAKE EXCEPTION TO NORMAL PROTOCOL TO REVISIT DECISIONS ON NONESSENTIAL, NONURGENT, NIXON, BARTON, TRAVER ROAD PROJECTS. I'M ADVOCATING FOR THE HAMPTS, KAUFMANS A YOUNG AND OTHERS WHO HAVE FELT VOICELESS BUT HAVE MADE IT CLEAR IN IN WRITING THAT THEY OBJECT TO THESE AND DO NOT HAVE THE ECONOMIC WHEREWITHAL TO RESPOND TO THE ASSESSMENT. WE ASK THAT THE PREVIOUSLY VOTED ON DECISIONS REGARDING THESE SIDEWALKS BE PUT ASIDE UNTIL AFTER THE NOVEMBER BALLOT. IT WOULD BE UNCONSCIONABLE TO EXCLUDEHESE FROM OUTCOME OF THE BALLOT. I WORRY THAT E PRESSURE OF MILLION DOLLARS CONTRACTS WITH LARGE CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES WILL OVERSHADOW THE CONCERNS AND NEEDS OF TAX PAYING, LAW ABIDING CITIZENS WHO ARE FEELING SOMEWHAT RAILROADED.
00:24:34.525: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
00:24:35.192: >> MY FAMILY HAS HAD THREE GENERATIONS GRADUATE FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN. WHEREVER IM.LUE BEFORE STRANGERS ANNRBOR HAS HELPED SHAPE WHO I AM AND IN SOME WAY, I HOPE I CAN SHAPE WHO ANN ARBOR IS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND EFFORTS AND WE DO APPRECIATE THAT YOU HAVE THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE CITIZENS AT HEART. THANK YOU.
00:24:58.983: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS JANE VOGEL.
00:25:06.290: >>lerk Beaudry: CALLER 958, GO AHEAD.
00:25:07.591: >> OKAY. THANK YOU. COUNCIL, I WANT TO SHARE TWO STORIES THAT AT THEIR ROOT ARE ABOUT ANN ARBOR AS A RECOGNIZED LEADER IN THE REGION AND NATIONALLY. STORY ONE. SOLAR FAITHFUL KICKED OFF IN LATE 2017, WHEN ANN ARB W E OF ABOUT 120 SMALL CITIES AROUND THE COUNTRY THAT GOT A $10,000 DOE GRANT TO DEVELOP A MODEL TO PROMOTE SOLAR IN THEIR COMMUNITY. ANN ARBOR'S MODEL CAME TOP SEVEN IN THE COUNTRY. AT A ZOOM-BASED WORKSHOP YESTERDAY, SUNDAY, 40 PARTICIPANTS CAME TOEAR ANN ARBOR'SUCCESS STORIES CLUDING MANY FROM THE WEST SIDE OF THE STATE AND A NUMBER FROM PITTSBURGH TO PHILADELPHIA. STORY TWO. THE MICHIGAN CLIMATE ACTION NETWORK HELD ITS CONFERENCE VIA ZOOM IN APRIL. TOWARD THE END THERE WERE 12, 15, QUICK UPDATES, FROM AROUND THE STATE, INCLUDING AN UPDATE THENN ARBOR CLIMATE NEUTRALITY PLAN, AS WELL AS U OF M.'S WORK IN THIS SPACE. WHAT WAS NOTABLE IS HOW MANY CITIES AROUND THE STATE ARE LOOKING TO ANN ARBOR'S CARBON NEUTRALITY PLAN AS A GUIDANCE FOR THEIR OWN. SCHLISSEL TALKED ABOUT.ESIDENT WE NEED TO COME UP WITH A REPLICABLE MODEL SO WE CAN HAVE AN IMPACT AT SCALE. LIKE ANN ARBOR, U OF M IS WORKING HARD TO DEVELOP AND RESOURCE THAT PLAN. LIKE ANN ARBOR, U OF M'S CONSTITUENTS, STUDENT, FACULTY, ALUMNI ARE MAKING THEIR VOICE HEARD AND A DEMAND FOR OUR ROBUST PLAN AND TIMELINE. OVER 1400 FACULTY -- AND THERE HAVE BEEN OVER 50 SPEAKERS AT REGENT'S MEETINGS. PREVIOUS GENERATIONS OF THIS COUNCIL HAVE A LEGACY OF LEADERSHIP THAT IS RECOGNIZED AND RESPECTED ACROSS THE STATE, THE REON AND NATIONALLY. ANN ARBOR RIGHT NOW, RIGHT NOW IS UNIQUELY POSITIONED NATIONALLY. THIS COUNCIL IN PARALLEL WITH THE REGIONS CAN COMMIT TO AND RESOURCE A CARBON NEUTRALITY PLAN THAT CAN INFORM EFFORTS AND MANY OTHER CITIES AND TOGETHER SCALE UP FOR THE IMPACT WE NEED TO ADDSS THE CLIMATE CRISIS.
00:27:40.978: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
00:27:42.413: >> LIKE THE TWO STORIES DEMONSTRATE, ANN ARBOR HAS A RECOGNIZED LEGACY OF LEADERSHIP TO BUILD ON AND STRENGTHEN. IT IS A MOMENT OF LEADERSHIP AND THE CLIMATE CRISIS AND IN THE SOCIAL JUSTICE CRISIS THAT IS THE FLIPSIDE OF THAT COIN. I CALL ON THIS COUNCIL TOTAND DEAD. ITILL BE HARD. AND THAT'S OKAY. WE WILL INNOVATE AND COLLABORATE AND WITH THE POSITIVE ATTITUDE, WE WILL WORK OUR WAY THROUGH THIS TOGETHER. THANK YOU.
00:28:17.481: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS RALPHCKEE. LPH MCKEE.
00:28:29.426: >> VAST MAJORITY --
00:28:32.563: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER 556?
00:28:33.197: >> I WANTED TO SPEAK TONIGHT ON LEADERSHIP AND DIVISIVENESS. THE VAST MAJORITY LISTENING TONIGHT WOULD AGREE THAT THERE'S SOME VERY BAD EXAMPLES AND SOME VERY GOOD EXAMPS OF LEARSHIP ON ALL THE CZINESS THAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW. AND THIS ISSUE IS A SMALL ISSUE, OBVIOUSLY, COMPARED TO THAT, BUT I DO HAVE A SMALL CRITICISM OF MAYOR TAYLOR AS TO DIVISIVENESS. THE BACKGROUND IS THIS. SINCE 2018, THERE HAVE BEEN COUNCIL CAUCUSES WITH PUBLIC INPUT HELD SUNDAYVENINGS FORE MONDAYIGHT COUNC MEETINGS. MAYOR TAYLOR AND HIS ALLIES ON COUNCIL, DON'T TYPICALLY ATTEND THOSE. WHAT MESSAGE WOULD THAT SEND? I WOULD READ THAT AS WE DON'T WANT TO WORK WITH THE OTHER COUNCILMEMBERS. MAYBE THAT'S NOT A BIG DEAL. WHEN THE MAYOR, YOU HAVE YOUR OWN EVENTS TO TALK ABOUT CITY BUSINESS, MAYBE THAT'S NOT A BIG DEAL EITHER, BUT I DO FIND IT HOLD YOUR EVENTS AT EXACTLY THE SAME TIME AS THE TRADITIONAL COUNCIL CAUCUSES. IT SENDS A VERY CLEAR, IT'S US vs. THEM KIND OF MESSAGE. AND WHAT ABOUT RESIDENTS WHO WOULD REALLY LIKE TO LISTEN TO DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES ON ISSUES OR PARTICIPATE IN BOTH OF THEM? THEY CAN'T. THAT'S DIVIVE. MAR TLOR, IF YOU DON'T WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE CAUCUSES, HOW ABOUT SCHEDULING YOUR EVENT AT A DIFFERENT TIME SO RESIDENTS WOULDN'T HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN EVENTS? AND PLEASE DON'T CRITICIZE OTHERS FOR BEING DIVISIVE, OR LAMENT THAT OTHERS ON COUNCIL AREN'T WORKING WITH YOU OR DON'T WANT TO WORK WITH YOU ON ISSUES BECAUSE REALLY, YOU ARE THE ONE THAT'SESPONSIBLE FOR SETTING THE TONE. THANKS FOR LISTENING.
00:30:14.364: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. ARE THERE COMMUNICATIONS TODAY FROM COUNCIL? I STRIVE TO LOOK ON THE -- I HAD GRISWOLD AND BANNISTER, BUT I RIVE TO LOOK AT TAISED ND. SO COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD?
00:30:35.752: >> Councilmember Griswold: OKAY. I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT CAUCUS IS REALLY AN OPTIONAL EVENT AND IT'S REALLY DESIGNED FOR PEOPLE THAT WANT TO GET SOMETHING OUT OF IT, AND SO IF YOU ARE NOT GOING TO GET ANYTHING OUT OF IT, DON'T FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE TO ATTEND. LAST NIGHT, WE HAD A RECORD 28 PARTICIPANTS AT ONE TIME. SO WE ACTUALLY WENT TO TWO SEPARATE SCREENS, WHICH WAS A BIT OF A CHALLENGE, BUT WE DID IT. I JUST WANT TO TALK ABOUT ALL OF THE POSITIVE ENERGY THAT WE HAVE HAD IN THIS COMMUNITY IN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS ANNOT ONLY IN TS COMMUNITY, BUT FIRST MOST PEOPLE KNOW THAT I GREW UP IN FLINT, MICHIGAN WHICH WAS BEST KNOWN FOR THE WATER CRISIS, BUT NOW IT IS KNOWN FOR A SHERIFF WHO HAS TAKEN THE LEAD ON COLLABORATING WITH PROTESTERS. HE'S BEEN ON THE NATIONAL NEWS AND I THINK THAT HE IS PROBABLY THE IMPETUS FOR MANY OTHER POCEHIEFS AND SHERIFFS TO JOIN THE PROTESTERS AND THAT'S JUST REALLY, REALLY WONDERFUL. OUR GOVERNOR WAS QUOTED AS SAYING, THESE ARE DARK TIMES. I WOULD AGREE THEY ARE DARK TIMES, BUT I THINK WE ALSO HAVE TO CELEBRATE ALL OF THE POSITIVES AND ALL OF THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE STEPPED UP DURING THIS TIME,O ADDRE PROEMS. I HAVE BEE TO TWO PEACEFUL PROTESTS IN THE LAST FEW DAYS. WE WILL PROBABLY ANOTHER ONE TOMORROW IN ANN ARBOR. SO FAR, WE ARE DOING IT RIGHT, GETTING THE MESSAGE OUT. TODAY DEBBIE DINGLE WAS THERE, AS WELL AS STATE SENATOR AND AND THE LAST THING I WANT TO SAY IS WHILE IT MAY LOOK LIKE THERE'S SOME DIVISIVENESS PUBLICLY, THERE'S BEEN A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF COLLABORATION THAT'S BEEN GOING ON WITH STAFF AND WITH COMMUNITY MEMBERS. I HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH ABOUT THE A2ZERO PLAN AND WAYS TO REACH CARBON NEUTRALITY AS A RESULT OF ALOF THE EMAILS AND PHONE CALLS FM COMMUNITY MEMBERS.

[CHORUS OF AYES] ALL MEMBERS ARE PRESENT AND THUS FULFILLING THE 8 VOTE REQUIREMENT FOR CA-3, I HAVE 13. DISCUSSION OF CA-8. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
00:37:47.951: >> Councilmember Ramlawi THAN YOU, MAYO TAYLOR. I APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT STAFF HAS DONE IN BRINGING THIS FORTH. THERE'S TWO MILLAGES HERE, TWO SEPARATE MILLAGES BEING PROPOSED. ONE IS A RENEWAL OF 2.1 FOR STREET AND SIDEWALK AND BRIDGES, AND THEN ALSO AN APPENDIX OF .2 MILLS FOR NEW SIDEWALKS. THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION AND CONSTERNATION FILLING SIDEWALK GAPS, ESPECIALLY ONES THAT REQUIRE BIG ASSESSMENTS. AND I THINK THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO EVENTUAY GET RESOLVED BUT WE CAN BETTER SERVE OUR CONSTITUENTS AND REACH OUR GOALS. I HAVE SENT, I HOPE -- MS. BEAUDRY HAS IT, AN AMENDMENT THAT I WANTED TO INCLUDE IN THIS RESOLUTION. THE .2 PART OF THIS RESOLUTION, THAT'S ASKING FOR US TO GO TO THE VOTERS AND HAVE THE VOTERS DECIDE. AND I'M NOT A BIG FAN RIGHT NOW OF ASKING PEOPLE TO SHELL OUT MORE MONEY CONSIDERING THE CLIMATE WE'RE FACING, AND WE'RE IN, AND WE TALK ABOUT AFFORDABILITY ATVE MEETING AND HER WE'RE ASKING FOR VOLTVOTERSFOR MORE MONEY. AND SO I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE --
00:39:28.151: >> Mayor Taylor: I WAS GOING TTOHAVE -- LET'S HAVE THIS MOTIN INTRODUCED AND MOVED AND SECONDED AND THEN YOU CAN TALK MO ABO. ITOVED BY YOU AND SECONDED BY? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER. SORRY, COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, YOU STILL HAVE THE FLOOR WITH RESPECT TO YOUR AMENDMENT.
00:39:46.936: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE IT. SO THIS AMENDMENT WILL DIRECT THIS NEW MILLAGE -- A PORTION OF THIS MILLAGE, AT LEAST GIVE SOME BETTER UNDSTAND WHEREHEOTERAN MONE IS GOING TO BE GOING AND HOW IT'S GOING TO BE SPENT AND PERHAPS ALSO ADDRESS SOME OF OUR ISSUES THAT WE HAVE IN APPROVING ASSESSMENTS. SO IT ASKS THAT THE PROCES -- SO OF THESE PROCEEDS, IF NOT ALL, SOME OF THEM, AT LEAST BE USED TO OFFSET THE SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS FOR THE RESIDENTS WHO DID NOT VOLUNTARILY INITIATE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS THAT TRIGGER THE NEED FOR A NEW SIDEWALK AND I APOLOGIZE FOR SOME OF THIS LANGUAGE, BUT I WAS HAVING TO DO IT ON THE FLY. SO THAT'S -- THAT'S IT IN A NUTSHELL.
00:40:42.859: >> Mayor Taylo SO I HAV GOT COUNCILMEMBE ACKERMAN AND HAYNER ON THE QUEUE, ON THE MAIN QUEUE. CAN I CLEAR YOU BOTH -- UNLESS YOU WISH TO BOTH SPEAK TO THE AMENDMENT, I'M GOING TO DROP YOU AND THEN WE'LL GET YOU BACK IN ON THE FLIP SIDE.
00:40:55.071: >> Councilmember Hayner:  ALL RIGHT.
00:40:56.172: >> Mayor Taylor: ALL RIGHT. SO PLEASE HELP REMIND ME OF THAT. DISCUSSION ON THE AMENDMENT, PLEASE? COUNCILMBER HAYNER?
00:41:06.015: >> Councmember Hayner: THANKS MR. MAY. I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY WITH THE OFFER, THAT THIS IS ANY PROJECTS BETWEEN NOW AND WHEN THIS MAY APPEAR ON THE BALLOT AND MAY OR MAY NOT BE PASSED, IS THAT WHAT YOUR SUGGESTION IS? IF A SIDEWALK IS COMING DOWN ON THESE FOLKS LIKE BOARDWALK IS, YOU ARE SAYING THA THIS MIGHT OFFSET THAT? I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE WHERE THIS NUDGES INTO THE PROCESS HERE. IS THIS TO GO BACKWARDS LIKE THOSE FOLKS ASK AT --
00:41:38.181: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I WOULDN'T SAY IT WOULD BE -- FOR IT TO GO BACKWARDS, I WOULD LOOK FOR OUR CITY ADMINISTRATOR TO SEE WHEN THIS COULD GO INTO EFFECT AND WHEN IT WOULD BE THE MO -- WHEN WOULD BE T SOONEST THAT ALL OF THIS WENT THROUGH, THAT THESE FUNDS WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR THOSE TYPE OF PROJECTS. BUT I THINK -- GO AHEAD.
00:42:02.772: >> City Admin. Crawford: WE ALSO HAVE MR. HUPY ON HERE IF YOU WANT TO SPEAK TO IT. THE FIRST THAT IT COULD POSSIBLY GO IS ACTUALLY DECEMBER BUT WE DON'T ACTUALLY LEVY IN DECEMR FOR CITY MILLAGE. WE LEVY IN JULY. I WOULD RECOMMEND JULY 1st OF NEXT YEAR WOULD BE THE EARLIEST THAT I THINK WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH HOW WE LEVY.
00:42:24.227: >> AND THAT FUNDS WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR FY-22 CONSTRUCTION.
00:42:31.034: >> City Admin. Crawford: RIGHT.
00:42:32.635: >> AND  TALK TO COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI'S, THIS WOULD BE SET UP AS A -- AN ENTERPRISE -- A DEDICATED FUND. SO IT WOULD ONLY BE USED FOR NEW SIDEWALK CONSTRUCTION. THE WAY THE RESOLUTION IS CURRENTLY WRITTEN, IT WLD MOVE ASSESSMTS TOTALLY WHETHER THAT'S WHAT COUNCIL DESIRES TO DO OR NOT, OR WHETHER COUNCIL WISHES TO HAVE SOME SORT OF BASE OR FLOOR ASSESSMENT WITH THE MILLAGE KICKING IN ON TOP OF THAT, THAT IS DIRECTION CITY STAFF WOULD GLADLYECEIVE, HOWEVER YOU WANT TO USE THE MILLAGE.
00:43:26.389: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: MR. HUPY, COULD THAT ADDITIONAL DIRECTION BE GIVEN AT A LATER TIME. WE JUST GOT THIS AND THERE'S A LOT TO CONSIDER, OBVIOUSLY. I'M JUST TING TOET US TRENDING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.
00:43:43.273: >> WE WOULD BE BRINGING BALLOT LANGUAGE BACK TO YOU IN JULY, AND I BELIEVE NICK HUTCHINS IS ON THE MEETING ALSO. HE CAN TELL YOU THE EXACT DATE THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO HAVE VALID -- BALLOT LANGUAGE TO YOU TOPPROVE.
00:44:00.990: >> May Taylor: LET ME SUGGEST THIS AND COUNCIL, THERE HAS BEEN -- I THINK IT'S PLAIN THAT SOME COUNCILMEMBERS ARE INTERESTED IN UTILIZING POTENTIAL MILLAGE MONIES BOTH ON A GOING FORWARD BASIS AND, YOU KNOW TO OFFSET -- TO OFFSET ASSESSMENTS OF THIS NATURE, ETHEROOKING BACKWARDS A LITTLE BIT OR MOVING FORWARD A LITTLE BIT. I DON'T KNOW THAT WE WILL GET SUPER CLEAR GUIDANCE TO STAFF AT THIS FUNKURE. PERHAPS -- JUNCTURE. PERHAPS WE CAN ASK STAFF AS BRING FORWARD MILLAGE LANGUAGE THAT THEY CONSIDER A COUPLE OF ALTERNATIVES WITH RESPECT TO UTILIZING MONIES, YOU KNOW, MAYBLOOKING BACARDS,AYBE, YOU KNOW, ON THE OFFSET FOR OTHER SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS, THAT THEY COME TO US WITH SOME PROPOSALS, BECAUSE THEY HAVE SET AT THE TABLE AND THEY HAVE SEEN HOW SOME COUNCILMEMBERS ARE INTERESTED IN MOVING ON THE ISSUE. THIS WAY WE HAVE MORE CLARITY AND A LITTLE MORE, YOU KNOW -- A POINOSAL FROM STAFF ON THE ISHAT ADEQUAT
00:45:09.926: >> Mayor Taylor: I DON'T KNOW HOW TO TELL WHETHER THAT'S ADEQUATE OR NOT.
00:45:14.263: >> WELL, IT'S ADEQUATE FROM US, IT'S GIVING US DIRECTION WHICH IS WHAT WE ARE SEEKING.
00:45:20.303: >> Mayor Taylor: MY INFERENCE IS THAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR SOME ALTERNATIVES ON THIS. I GUESS THAT'S MY SUGGESTN. I HAV LUMM, BANNISTER AND GND IN THE QUEUE. I SHOULD SAY TOO, OUR PRIOR MEETINGS HAVE GONE ON FOR QUITE SOMETIME AND I'M JUST, YOU KNOW, -- I'M TRYING TO KEEP TRACK OF THREE MINUTES AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S SOME PLAY, BUT, YOU KNOW, I'M KEEPING A CLOCK. AND SO WHOEVER IS -- WHOEVER THE FIRST PERSON IS THAT HAPPENS TO TALK IN THREE MINESND I OBSERVIT, IT'S N PERSONAL. I'M TRYING TOET DID DOWN FOR ITR EVERYONE. LUMM, BANNISTER GRAND.
00:46:02.678: >> Councilmember Lumm: I HAVE A FOLLOW ON TO COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI'S PROPOSAL. JUST IN GENERAL. I HAVE COMMENTS IF I MAY. I HAVE COMMES. IUBMITTED A QUESTION AND THANKS FOR YOUR RESPONSE, MR. HUPY OR MR. HUTCHINSON, WHOEVER RESPONDED. AND THIS IS HOW THE QUESTION IS FORMED WHEN IT COMES BACK TO US IN JULY OR QUESTIONS. I ASKED IF THE .2 MILLAGE WOULD BE PASSED, IF IT WOULD BE COMBINED WITH THE 25 MILL MILLAGE OR IF IT WOULD BE MAINTAINED SEPARATELY, AND RESPONSE INDICATED THAT IT WAS WRITTEN WITH THE PRESUMPTION THAT THE .2 WOULD BE ADDED TO THE STREET, BRIDGE, AND, DID THE EXISTING STREET, BRIDGE AND SIDEWALK MILLAGE. AND THAT YOU WOULD SPELL OUT THE USE ON HOW TS MILLA MONEY WOULD B USEDND ALTERNATIVELY, YOU MENTIONED THIS OTHER OPTION AND I WOULD APPRECIATE WHEN YOU BRING IT BACK TO US, IF YOU COULD GIVE US -- COME BACK WITH THESE TWO OPTIONS, IS THAT DOABLE? THE OTHER OPTION IS THAT THE .2 MILLS FOR NEW SIDEWALKS WOULD BE A SEPARATE MILLAGE BECAUSE IT'S A NEW MILLAGE. AND THAT THAT COULD BE SET UP, IF YOU SAID -- I YOU NED W WOULD START COLLECTING ON THAT. SO CAN YOU BRING THESE TWO OPTIONS? MR. HUPY? THANKS.
00:47:26.929: >> WHEN THAT ANSWER WAS WRITTEN, WE WERE ASSUMING THAT WE WOULD BE RENEWING THE STREET BRIDGE RESURFACING MILLAGE AT THE SAME TIME,ND POTENTIALLY STARTING IT AT THE SAME TIME AS THE SIDEWALK MILLAGE. IT'S LOOKING LIKE THEY WILL NOT BE STARTING AT THE SAME TIME IF WE DO THE SIDEWALK MILLAGE EARLIER TO GET A YEAR'S USE OUT OF IT, BEFORE THE STREET, BRIDGE AND RESURFACING MILLAGE IS DUE. SO THEY WOULD HAVE TO STAY IN SEPARATEUNDS.
00:48:01.230: >> Cncilmember Lm: OKAY. OKAY. THANKS. THANKS FOR ANSWERING THAT. MAY I JUST DO MY COMMENT THEN, MR. MAYOR, ON THIS SINCE IT WAS PULLED OUT? IS THAT OKAY?
00:48:11.207: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
00:48:11.707: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANKS. I WON'T RAISE MY HAND AGAIN. SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE THAT THIS CONSTRUCTION -- FOR CONSTRUCTING NEW SIDEWALKS AND FILLING SIDEWALK GAPS IS OBVIOUSLY BECOME AN IMPORTANT ONE AND I THINK THE VOTERS SHOULD DECIDE THIS QUESTION. I WILL SAY, I DO HAVE SERIOUS RESERVATIONS ABOUT ADOPTING ANY NEW TAX MILLAGE AT THIS TIME, INCLUDING THIS ONE, AND WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE RUGGLING RIG NOW AND I LIKELY WOULD OPPOSE THE PASS IN NOVEMBER. I ALSO HAVE REAL CONCERNS ABOUT THE EQUITY OF CHANGING THE RULES THAT EXISTED FOR DECADES AND WE ALL KNOW WE HAVE MANY PEOPLE ACROSS TOWN WHO ARE MAKING THOSE INSTALLMENT PLANS ON THEIR ASSESSMENTS THAT WE HAVE APPROVED OVER RECENT YEA. HANG SAID THAT, I FULLY SUPPORT THE RIGHT OF VOTERS TO DECIDE THESE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS. WITH MY APOLOGIES, MR. MAYOR, WHEN YOU VETOED THE RESOLUTION TO ALLOW VOTERS TO DECIDE THE QUESTION OF NON NONPARTISAN ELECTIONS IN NOVEMBER, I WILL JUST SAY I DO N PREME THAT I KNOW BETTER THAN VOTERS AND I WOULD NEVER STAND IN THE WAY OF THEIR DEMOCRATIC WAY TO DECIDE AN IMPORTANT QUESTION. I PERSONALLY DO NOT AGREE. IF THIS EXTRA TAX IS TO BE ON THE BALLOT IN NOVEMBER, IT'S IMPORTANT THAT IT BE A SEPARATE QUESTION, I BELIEVE, WHICH IS WHY I HAVE -- I QUESTIONED MR. HU AND STAFF THAT IT BE SEPARATE QUESTIOFROM THE RENEWAL OF THE EXISTING STREET AND SIDEWALK MILLAGE AND THAT IS WHAT IS CONTEMPLATED HERE AND I ALSO THINK HAVING SEPARATE BALLOT QUESTIONS IS THE MORE TRANSPARENT APPROACH, AND IT PROVIDES VOTERS THE MAXIMUM RANGE OF CHOICES AS WELL. I'M ALSO COMFORTABLE WITH HAVING THE VOTES IN NOVEMBER, RATHER THAN WAITING UNTIL NEXT YEA WHEN THE EXISTING STREET AND SIDEWALK MILLAGE EXPIRES AND AT THIS POINT, THERE'S NO SCHEDULED ELECTION FOR NEXT YEAR. SO CONDUCTING THE REFERENDUM THIS NOVEMBER AVOIDS THE POSSIBLE COST OF THE SPECIAL EHECKION. I ALSO BELIEVE THAT IF THIS MILLAGE IS APPROVED BY VOTERS IT'S IMPORTANT TO TRACK THE MILLAGE FDS ARE GOING TO FIXK THE ROADS. THIS WAS A PROBLEM WE COMBINED ALL OF THESE YEARS AGO. I UNDERSTAND THIS IS TO DIRECT STAFF TO DEVELOP THE LANGUAGE BUT WE SHOULD NOT DIRECT STAFF TO DO ALL THE WORK UNLESS WE ARE COMFORTABLE PUTTING THE QUESTION TO VOTERS. I'M COMFORTAB ALLING VOTS TO DIDE, EVENHOUGH I LIKELY WON'T ULTIMATELY SUPPORT THE PASSAGE IN NOVEMBER. I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS RESOLUTION TONIGHT. THANKS.
00:51:03.379: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER AND I THINK WE ARE STILL ON THE AMENDMENT.
00:51:12.221: >> Councilmember Bannister: OKAY. I'M ASKING FOR CLARIFICATION THEN. WHAT WE COULD DO IS NING ENRTAIN ALL OF THESE -- WE WOULD HAVE ALL THE AMENDMENTS INCLUDED AS STAFF WORKS ON THEM OR ARE WE GOING TO WORK THROUGH THE AMENDMENTS TONIGHT?
00:51:27.737: >> Mayor Taylor: I GUESS MY SUGGESTION IS THAT WE -- IF IT'S COUNCIL'S PLEASURE, THAT WE PULL THE AMENDMENT OFF, WPA T ARE SOLUTION, STAFF -- BUT STAFF GOES FORWARD ON THE UNDERSTANDING THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING FOR SOME OPTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE -- THE USE OF MILLAGE FUNDS, OPTIONS THAT INCLUDE, YOU KNOW, SOME LOOK BACK ON ASSESSMENTS PREVIOUSLY PASSED AND OPTIONS THAT LO TO ASSIST RESIDENTS WHO ARE -- YOU KNOW WHO HAVE BEEN ASSESSED IN A MANNER THAT MAKES THEM UNHAPPY. I GUESS THAT WOULD INVOLVE COUNCIL'S ACQUIESCENCE TO THE REMOVAL OF THE AMENDMENT AND THEN, YOU KNOW, MOVING FORWARD IN THE ORDINARY COURSE.
00:52:18.821: >> Councilmember Bannister: I'M FINE WITHHAT. Mayor Taylo CAN WE JUST SAY, DOES ANYBODY -- IF I MAY, IS EVERYBODY ALREADY WITH THAT REMOVING THE AMENDMENT AS IS? I HAVE GRAND AND THEN -- I HAVE BANNISTER, ACTUALLY ON THE QUEUE. I NEED MORE FEEDBACK BEFORE I CAN SAY ANYTHING. SO GSS BANNISTER.
00:52:46.348: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WOULD LEAVE IT UP TO THE PROPOSER. AS THE SECONDER --
00:52:51.921: >> Mayor Taylor: IT'S THE BODY'S, ALTHOUGH COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, SINCE YOU BROUGHT IT, IS THAT OKAY WITH YOU?
00:52:58.661: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: ABSOLUTELY. I DIDN'T MEAN TO GET STUCK UP ON THIS AS LONG AS WE HAVE, BUT IT'S PART OF A BROADER DISCUSSION.
00:53:08.938: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THIS ALL RIGHT? DOES ANYBODY OBJECT TO WITHDRAWING THE AMENDMENT AND MOVING FORWARD?
00:53:12.741: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: WELL, I'M SORRY. I THOUGHT YOUR ACTION AS TO DO THE OTHER TO DO THE OPPOSITE. I THOUGHT IT WAS A FRIENDLY AMENDMENT. NO?
00:53:20.015: >> Mayor Taylor: THE AMENDMENT PROVIDES -- NO. IT WAS TO WITHDRAW THE AMENDMENT, AND THEN HAVE STAFF COME FORWARD AND HAVE THINGS ESNTIALLY WORK THROUGH A COUPLE OF OPTIONS ON HOW WE SHOULD ADDRESS THE USE OF THE MILLAGE MONEY. DO WE SIMPLY LOOK FORWARD? DO WE HELP OUT?
00:53:40.669: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I THINK THAT'S A SEPARATE ISSUE, THE TIMING WHERE THE FUNDS OUGHT TO BE DIRECTED AND I DON'T WANT I WANT ITOTED OITHDRAWN.
00:53:50.946: >> Mayor Taylor: THE AMENDMENT IS ON THE FLOOR. I HAVE BANNISTER, GRAND AND THEN COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, IF YOU COULD CLICK YOUR MOUSE, THAT WAY I'M SURE I KNOW WHERE YOU ARE IN THE QUEUE. COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER ON THE AMENDMENT.
00:54:01.790: >> Councilmember Bannister: OKAY, WELL, THIS IS THE FIRST THOUGHT OF ME TO THIS AMENDMENT SO THAT IF THE SIDEWALK WAS NOT NOT BE PAID -- IT WOULD WOU VOLUNTARILY INITIATED SIDEWALKS WOULD NOT BE PAID FOR WITH THIS MILLAGE. AND THAT -- I'M NOT SURE I LIKE THE SOUNDS OF THAT, ALTHOUGH I'M OPEN TO HEARING OTHER PEOPLE'S COMMENTS BECAUSE I DO LIKE THE IDEA OF RESIDENTS WHO NEED A SIDEWALK FOR SAFETY REASONS OR WHATNOT, TO BE ABLE TO GET ONE. AND MAYBE WHAT WOULD MAKE THIS AMENDMENT MORE APPEALING WOULD BE IF IT WOULD STILL HAVE TO MEET SOME CRITERIA FOR A NECESSIT IT WOULDN'T BE JUST BECAUSE -- FOR AESTHETICS OR LANDSCAPING, BUT FOR SAFETY PURPOSE.
00:55:08.123: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND?
00:55:10.025: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. I WAS ALSO HOPING WE COULD PULL THIS AND JUST GIVE STAFF SOME GENERAL DIRECTION BECAUSE A COUNCIEMBER RAMLAWI POIED OUT, THI WAS DONE A LITTLEIT ON THE FLY. SO IT WOULD BE MY PREFERENCE TO VOTE THIS DOWN AND GIVE STAFF GENERAL DIRECTION. I PERSONALLY WOULD PREFER SOMETHING A LITTLE -- I DON'T KNOW, IT SEEMS -- TO ME, IT SEEMS LIKE WE COULD JUST ASK THAT IF IT'S A N DEVELOPMENT, THAT BUILDS THE SIDEWALK, I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE PURPO THAT ANYON INTEN FORHE MILLAGE, RIGHT, THAT THE DEVELOPMENT WOULD THEN PAY FOR THAT SIDEWALK. IF IT'S FILLING A GAP, THEN I THINK THIS -- AT LEAST FOR MY PERSPECTIVE, THIS IS HOW I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THOSE FUNDS USED. SO I DON'T KNOW IF -- I JUST -- I THINK THAT'S WHAT COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI IS TRYING TO GET AT, BUT I DRAW THE LINE AT MORE LIKE NEW DEVELOPME, RSUS FILLING SIDEWALK GAP AN THAT'S JUST THE DIRECTION A WANT TO COVER WITH STAFF. SO I APPRECIATE WHERE HE'S COMING FROM AND I WILL VOTE NO BECAUSE I WANT US TO GIVE FEEDBACK TO STAFF IN GENERAL AND MOVE FORWARD WITH THE LANGUAGE IN JULY.
00:56:20.329: >> Mayor Tlor: COUILMEMBER LUMM?
00:56:22.197: >> Councilmeer Lumm: I D THINK TT WE NEED TO PROVIDE THIS DIRECTION TO THE STAFF TO GO OFF AND GIVE OUR FORMAL BLESSING TO GENERATE THIS BALLOT QUESTION AND THIS RESOLUTION DOES THAT. SO I THINK THIS IS THE APPROPRIATE FIRST STEP TO TAKE AS A BODY. IHINK THAT, Y KNOW, GOOD POINTS ARE BEING RAISED HERE OBVIOUSLY. COUNCILMEMBER GRAND YOUR CONCERNS AND OTHERS, I THINK IT'S UP TO US TO WORK WITH STAFF, BETWEEN NOW AND JULY, WHEN IT'S -- SO WHAT COMES BACK TO US AND THEN WE CAN CONTINUE TO SUBMIT QUESTIONS AND -- AND SUGGT REVISIONS BUT SO THAT WE CAN PRODUCE A PRODUCT THAT ADDRESSES THE VARIOUS CONCERNS. WE AREN'T GOING TO DO THAT TONTONIGHT, OBVIOUSRY. I WOULD LIKE TO -- OBVIOUSLY. I WOULD LIKE TO VOTE THIS, AND THEATH Y SGESTED BASICALLY WE NOT PROCEED ON MR. MAYOR, I BELIEVE. THAT THERE IS A TIMING CONCERN WITH SOME OF THESE THINGS BECAUSE I -- YOU KNOW, THERE IS A CONCERN ABOUT THE -- IT'S MENTIONED AGAIN TONIGHT BY SOME OF THE SPEAKERS, PRERS,ROJECTS R NIN, TRAVER, ET CETERA, SIDEWALKS THAT WE JUST APPROVED AND FOR SOME OF THESE, I THINK CONSTRUCTION WAS SUPPOSED TO BEGIN THIS SUMMER. THE FULLER, NIXON, TRAVER, I THINK THE WORK IS SUPPOSED TO START IN THE FALL OF 2020; IS THAT CORRECT, MR. HUTCHINSON OR HUPY?
00:58:10.773: >> I CAN JP INHERE. ON NIXON AND TRAVER AND FULLER COURT, WE ARE LOOKING TO START CONSTRUCTION NEXT SPRING FOR A VARIETY OF ISSUES, WE STILL NEED TO GET THROUGH THE FEDERAL PROCESS OF PLAN APPROVAL AND BID LIGHTING. SO BY THE TIME WE GET THROUGH THAT, IT WILL BE FAIRLY LITE THE SEASON AND SO WE ARE LOOKING AT THAT STARTING MAYBE APRIL OF NEXT YEAR.
00:58:38.133: >> Councilmember Lumm: OKAY. THANK YOU. THE WORK ON BARTON DRIVE HAS BEGUN ALREADY, ALTHOUGH NOT THE SIDEWALK WORK YET.
00:58:48.010: >> Councilmember Lumm: OKAY. THANKS.
00:58:51.046: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
00:58:52.247: >> Councilmember Ackerman: ITHANKS, MR. MAYOR. THANKS TO STAFF T FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. I'M GLAD YOU ARE SAYING A STEP TO SOLVE THOSE DEBATES. THANK YOU. I DON'T THINK I WILL SUPPORT THIS AMENDMENT SIMPLY BECAUSE I WANT STAFF TO HAVE FLEXIBILITY TO CREATE MULTIPLE OPTIONS AND I DON'T WANT TO LOCK OURSELVES INTO THIS. I DON'T THINK I HAVE ANY OBJECTIONS TO THISDEAEING INCLUDED IN ANPTION, B I DO JUST WANT TO CONFIRM SOMETHING. SO I WILL GIVE A HYPOTHETICAL THAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT IS IF I WERE THIS -- AND THIS IS CERTAINLY A HYPOTHETICAL, IF I WERE A WEALTHY RESIDENT AND I WANTED TO JUM THE QUEUE OF FUNDING A SIDEWALK IN FRONT OF MY OWN HOUSE, WOULD THAT IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO BUILD SIDEWALKS AND ELSEWHERE? IF THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE VOLUNTARILY SIGNING UP TO PAY FOR THESE THINGS CAN WE JUST ADD THEM TO A GIVEN CONSTRUCTION YEAR OR WOULD THAT IMPACT THE KIND OF SOCIALIZED CONSTRUCTION THAT WE ARE DOING ELSEWHERE TO FILL GAPS? AROUNDHE CITY?
01:00:04.319: >> WE CAN -- WE CAN DO THAT AND WE HAVE ACTUALLY DONE THAT IN THE PAST. WE HAVE BEEN APPROACHED BY USUALLY NOT INDIVIDUALS BUT LIKE A CONDO ASSOCIATION, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT HAS REQUESTED A SIDEWALK, AND -- AND HAS SAID THAT THEY WOULD PAY FOR IT. AND WE HAVE GONE AHEAD AND DONE THAT UNDER A SEPARATE AGREEMENT ASSESSMENT. ASPECIAL
01:00:24.172: >> Councilmember Ackerman: OKAY. AND THAT WOULD IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO CONSTRUCT ELSEWHERE OTHER SIDEWALK GAPS THAT WE WOULD OTHERWISE BE BUILDING?
01:00:33.782: >> I WOULDN'T THINK THAT IT WOULD, NO.
01:00:35.250: >> Councilmember Ackerman: GREAT. THAT'S PERFECT. THANK YOU.
01:00:39.821: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE AMENDMENT? FORY PART, I GOING TO VOTE AGAINST THE AMENDMENT. I DON'T QUITE -- IT JUST DOESN'T STRIKE ME AS SUFFICIENTLY CLEAR TO BE DIRECTION TO STAFF AND IT'S SORT OF -- I THINK IT'S OVER INCLUSIVE. IT'S NOT TIME LIMITED. I'M NOT SURE HOW FAR IT GOES BACK BEING DOESN'T GO BACK WHEN IT SAYS THE PROCEEDS. OR DOES TT MEAN A SUBSET OF THE PROCEEDS? YEAH. I MEAN, TO ME, IT'S -- IT'S NOT SUFFICIENTLY CLEAR, I THINK TO BE PROPER LANGUAGE OF INSTRUCTION IN THE RESOLUTION, OKAY, BUT FOR IT TO BE SPECIFIC INSTRUCTION, NO.
01:01:33.775: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I WOULD INVITE MORE INSTRUCTION. I WOULD INVITE CRAFTING THE LANGUAGE IS INSUFFICIENT. I THINK IT'S A GOOD BR BASIS, AI WOULD INVITE YOU TO OFFER -- APECIA THE FEEDBK.T, YOU KNOW, I
01:01:52.327: >> Mayor Taylor: WELL, AS IT WAS SLIGHTLY DIRECTED TO ME, I WILL JUMP THE QUEUE. I WOULD NEED TO TALK TO STAFF AND HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT OUR OPTIONS ARE AND HOW THIS WOULD PROPERLY WORK. THAT'S WHY I THINK THE PROPER AND WISE THING TO DO IS TO SAY COUNCILMEMBERS ARE INTERESTED IN HELPING RESIDENTS THAT DON'T YOU SFF, AS YOU GO FORWARD WITH DRAFTING THE ULTIMATE LANGUAGE, THINK ABOUT THAT AND GIVE US SOME OPTIONS. THAT MAKES SENSE TO ME. I'M NOT GOING TO BE IN A POSITION TO CRAFT THIS WITH PARTICULARITY. COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
01:02:32.000: >> Councmember Bannier: YEAH, I - A, I WANT TO GO WITH COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI'S SUGGESTION BUT I ALSO HAVE LIKE A RANDOM SORT OF SUGGESTION TOO FOR AMENDMENT SUCH THAT CURRENT PROJECTS, PARTICULARLY THE BARTON ROAD, THE NIXON, FULLERTON, TRAVER AND JACKSON AVENUE BE INCLUDED IN THIS MILLAGE WHEN THEY DO COME IN. SO THAT'S WHY THIS PARTICULAR AMENDMENT IS A LITTLE -- I LIKE -- I THINK MAYOR TAYLOR, YOUR METHOD BETTER, WHERE WE SUBMIT ALL SIX OF OUR DIFFERENT PREFERENCES TO STAFF AND THEN THEY PREPARE IT FROM THERE.
01:03:27.089: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE AMENDMENT? CAN I GET A ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER ON THE AMENDMENT.
01:03:35.630: >> Councilmember Hayner:  NO.
01:03:38.333: >> Councilmber Bannister: YES.
01:03:41.536: >> Councilmember Griswold: NO.
01:03:47.909: >> Councilmember Lumm: NO.
01:03:51.746: >> Councilmember Grand: NO.
01:03:52.347: >> Councilmember Ackerman: NO.
01:03:58.019: >> Mayor Taylor: NO.
01:03:59.187: >> Councilmember Eaton: YES.
01:03:59.788: >>ouncilmember Neln:  NO.
01:04:04.926: >> Councilmember Smith: NO.
01:04:05.894: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES.
01:04:06.928: >> Clerk Beaudry: THE MOTION FAILS.
01:04:09.164: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN MOTION, GOING BACK TO COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN AND HAYNER IN THE CUE. ZACK ACTUALLY EVERYTHING I BROUGHT UP HAS BEEN DISCUSSED. I'M GD.
01:04:22.010: >>ayor Taylor:COUNCILMEMR HAYNER TO CLARIFY THAT THIS WILL BE ITS OWN MILLAGE AND SPECIFICALLY FOR THE NEW SIDEWALK CONSTRUCTION OR THE SIDEWALK GAP CONSTRUCTION AND THAT WE ARE ABLE TO SEND RECOMMENDATIONS TO STAFF UNDER THIS IF THIS PASSES, THAT AHE IS CONSIDER EFFECT -- THAT'S CORRECT? I WAS THINKING -- I MENTIONED THIS MANY TIMES THAT I THINK IT'S A COMMON GOOD AND WE SHOULD HAVE A COMMON WAY TO PAY FORT. ALSO -- NOT TO CONFUSE THE ISSUE, I'M NOT SURE HOW IT WOULD APPEAR ON THE BALLOT, BUT I ALSO RESPECT THE NOTION THAT WE HAVE ALWAYS KIND OF STUCK HOMEOWNERS A LITTLE LIT AND THERE MAY BE A TOKEN FEE THAT HOMEOWNERS PAY, AND I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT DISTINCTION WHEN A NEW SUB GOES IN -- NOT THAT THERE'S MUCH OF AT LEFT -- THAT THOSE DEVELOPERS PAY FOR THE SIDEWALKS. HE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE OPPORTUNITIES -- I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE OPPORTUNITIES EXIST. AND IT SEEMS THAT STAFF HAS ALWAYS BEEN WILLING TO WORK WITH US AND I FULLY SUPPORT THIS NOTION AND THANK YOU.
01:05:22.671: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
01:05:23.838: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES, AND I'M JUST THINKING OF WATCHING UALK ABOUT THIS, AND I WOULD JUST LIKEO ASK A QUESTION OF US OR STAFF FOR THE THREE CURRENT CONTROVERSIAL PROJECTS, ESPECIALLY THE BARTON DRIVE THAT IS -- THE WATER MAIN IS ALREADY BEING WORKED ON. THE EFFIENCIES THAT WE SAVE BY HAVING -- DOING IT AT THE SAME TIME AS THE WATER MAIN, OTHER PEOPLE HAVE SAID THAT WE HAVE GOT OTHER NEARBY CONTREAT PROJECTS THAT WE COULD REASSIGN THE WORKERS, I BELIEVE COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER MENTIONED THERE WAS A COUPLE SIDEWALK REPAIR PROJECTS IN THE NEIGORHOOD THAT -- THAT CONTRACTORS COULD WORK ON OVER THERE. IF FOR SOME REASON WE NEED TO FINISH THE DESIGN PLANS FOR THE BARTON DRIVE, TO MY KNOWLEDGE, THE DESIGN PLANS ARE -- THE SWITCHBACK AND ALL OF THAT HAS NOT BEEN RESOLVED, AND SO MY CONCER IS HOW CAN WE ADDSS THESE PEOPLE ON THE -- WATCHING FROM HOME, WHO ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE CURRENT PROJECTS? I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S A QUESTION FOR MR. HUPY OR MR. HUTCHINS OR -- IS THERE ANYTHING THAT WE CAN OFFER TO THE -- AS FOR THESE CURRENT PROJECTS THAT -- WAS THE IMPETUS FOR THIS WHOLE MILLAGE ACTUALLY, IN MANY WAYS?
01:07:18.787: >> City Admin. Crawford: I'M NOT SURE IF MANY HUPY IS ABLE TO -- THERE WE GO.
01:07:22.223: >> I WILL JUMP IN AND THE ANSWER IS, IT MAY BE A LEGAL QUESTION WITH A MILLAGE AND WE WOULD LOOK AT THAT IN DRAFTING THE LANGUAGE. GENERALLY, THE MILLAGE WOULD BE PROSPECTIVE AND NOT RETRO.
01:07:43.578: >> Councilmember Bannister: COULD WE HAVE SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE OFFICIAL BECAUSE I KNOW THOSE PEOPLE ARE LOOKING OUT THEIR WINDOW AND WONDERING, WHAT'S HAPPENING OR WHAT THEIR NEXT MONTH OF IS. OR IS THAT BARTON DRIVE SIDEWALK ACTUALLY NOT COMING ANY TIME SOON? MR. HUTCHINSON MENTIED IT'S ALREY STARTED AND I I CAN SEE THAT IT'S STARTED, BUT IF THEY ARE GOING TO BE WORKING ON THE WATER MAIN UNTIL AUGUST, THEN WE HAVE SOME TIME.
01:08:17.479: >> City Admin. Crawford: I BELIEVE IT'S SCHEDULED FOR JULY OR AUGUST. I DON'T REMEMBER EXACTLY, BUT THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKSOW, IN CERTAINLY. BUT I BELIEVE THE WHOLE PROJECT IS SCHEDULED TO BE  TO BE DONE E END OF AUGUST.
01:08:33.528: >> City Admin. Crawford: IF I MIGHT, SO THOSE PROJECTS ARE APPROVED AND WOULD PROCEED UNLESS COUNCIL -- BECAUSE THE DIRECTION ON THE MILLAGE IS COMING LATER, THOSE PROJES WOD LIKELY PCEED UNLESS COUNCI WERE TO BRING THOSE ITEMS BACK AND HAVE THEM RECONSIDERED. THE TIMING JUST DOESN'T WORK OUT ANY OTHER WAY.
01:08:54.382: >> Councilmember Bannister: WELL, AT THE MAY 18 MEETING, IF WE REWATCH THE VIDEO, WE DID SEE THAT THIS WAS INTEREST WITH COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI AND MAYBE EVEN COUNCILMEMBER SMITH, I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK FORNYONE, BUT THEREAS IEREST IN CONSOLIDATING THE THREE PROJECTS TO LOOK AS WE BRAINSTORM AND COME UP WITH A BETTER SOLUTION. AND THIS MILLAGE IS A GREAT SOLUTION. SO I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE HOW IT -- HOW WE COULD USE IT TO MAKE THESE THREE EXISTING PROJECTS UNDER THERE.
01:09:37.859: >> City Admin. Crawford: I THINK STAFF IS HEARING YOU, THAT AS WE DEVELOP OPTIONS WE CAN LOOK AT THAT FOR THE MILLAGE LANGUAGE AND SEE IF THAT'S POSSIBLE AS AN OPTION.
01:09:48.403: >> Councilmember Bannister: AND IF T MLAGE LANGUAGE DOESN'T COM BK, THOUGH, UNTIL AFTER THE SIDEWALK IS DONE, ARE WE ON PINS AND NEEDLES OR SOMETHING?
01:10:01.883: >> City Admin. Crawford: WELL, THE MILLAGE WOULDN'T BE VOTED ON AT THE EARLIEST, YOU KNOW, BY THE VOTERS UNTIL NOVEMBER. PAST THE CONCLUSION OF THESE PROJECTS SO THAS SOMETHING WE WOULD HAVE TO LOOK INTO.
01:10:15.330: >> Councilmember Bannister: WELL, I'M JUST TRYING TO AVOID ANY MISUNDERSTANDING. THERE WAS SOME MISUNDERSTANDING AFTER THE MAY 18 MEETING ABOUT WHAT INTENTIONS WERE, AND SO I JUST WANT TO UNDERLINE THAT MY INTENTION IS THAT HOPEFUL COULD BE INCLUDED IN WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOLUTIONS. AND ALSO, THERE'S THE WHOLE ISSUE THAT AS WE HAVE SEEN THIS IS TRICKY WITH TECHNOLOGY AND A LOT OF THE RESIDENTS ARE -- WERE UNABLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO CALL IN, YOU KNOW, I HAD TO HELP AND SO FORTHND S ON, A LOT OF THEM ARE NOT AWARE OF HOW TO -- HOW TO -- WITH THE PANDEMIC, YOU CAN'T JUST BE OUT TALKING YOUR NEIGHBORS ABOUT IT, AND -- AND SO I'M UNCOMFORTABLE MAKING THESE IRREVOCABLE COSTLY DECIONS UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES AND I WILL CLOSE WITH THAT, THAT I'M LOOKING -- I APPRECIATE COUNCILMEMBER LUMM'S CONCERN ABOUT NOT RAISING TAXES, BUT 5,000 TO $50,000 ON AN INDIVIDUAL IS SIMILARLY NOT FORDABLE AND SO --
01:11:43.318: >> Mayor Taylor: IT'S BEEN A COUPLE OF MINUTES. THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
01:11:53.161: >> Councilmember Lumm: QUICKLY. THE -- IN TERMS OF THE PLAN FOR THIS GAP IN THIS PERIOD, BETWEEN NOW AND WHENHE MEY WOU ACTULY BE COLLECTED, I DID ASK ABOUT THAT, AND STAFF INDICATED THAT THE PROJECT IS APRO OFFED THAT WE -- APPROVED, AND THAT WE WOULD GO FORWARD UNDER THE CURRENT SYSTEM. I THINK AS WE GO FORWARD, THE CLARITY ON THAT, WE HAVE SO MANY SIDEWALK GAP PROJECT THAT WHETHER EY WERE STAND ALONE SIDEWALKS THAT WERE BUILT OR GAPS THAT WERE FILLED IN CONJUNCTION WITH OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS, WATER MAINS, SANITARY SEWER, ET CETERA, ET CETERA, THAT WERE INSTALLED, WE DO HAVE RESIDENTS ACROSS THE CITY WHO ARE PING THEIR SPEAL ASSESSMEN A INSTALLMENTS OVER A PERIOD OF, YOU KNOW, MANY YEARS. AND I THINK CLARITY ON HOW WE WOULD PROCEED WITH THOSE SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS WOULD ALSO BE HELPFUL.
01:13:00.728: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER SMITH?
01:13:03.197: >> Councilmember Smith: YEAH, I JUST WANTED TO KIND O ECHO SOME OF WHAT COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER WAS SAYING IN THAT MY HOPE IS TO BE PRESENTED WITH OPTIONS OF FLEXIBLY USING THIS. I THINK COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER AND I ARE IN COMPLETE AGREEMENT THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE CITY SHOULD HAVE ALWAYS BEEN TAKING CARE OF AND THIS MILLAGE IS A WAYO SOLVEHE PROEM. ATHE END OF THE DAY, THE MILLAGE CAN NEVER BE BIG ENOUGH TO MAKE IT RIGHT FOR EVERYBODY THAT'S BEEN DINGED BY THIS IN THE PAST, BUT, YOU KNOW, AT LEAST FOR THESE PROJECT AS THERE'S BEEN MOMENTUM TO POTENTIALLY MOVE FORWARD, THEN, YOU KNOW, I WOULD LIKE TO UNDERSTAND THE FULL ABILITY TO LOOK AT USING SOME O TSE FUNDS TO HELP OFFSET THESE PROJECTS. YOU KNOW, IN THE EVENT THAT THIS MILLAGE DOESN'T PASS, THEN, YOU KNOW, WE ARE IN THE SAME BOAT WE ARE IN NOW, OBVIOUSLY. EITHER WAY, WE HAVE A LOT OF SIDEWALK GAPS TO FILL AND NOT A WHOLE LOT OF DOLLARS TO DO IT OUTSIDE OF MAKING PEOPLE PAY FOR . I THINK THIS IS AN IMPORNT STEP FORWA TO COMPLETING THE NON-MOTORIZED NETWORK. I'M EXCITED TO PUT IT BEFORE THE VOTERS AND LET THEM WEIGH IN ON IT. SO I WOULD APPRECIATE ANY STAFF GUIDANCE THAT WE COULD HAVE ON HOW WE COULD USE THESE PROCEEDS TO HELP OFFSET THE PROJECTS WE HAVE BEEN CONTEMPLATING AND THAT THERE'S BEEN CONTROVERSY ABOUT THIS YEAR, AND, YOU KNOW, THE MORE OPTIONS YOUAN GIVE US, I THINK THE ME HELPFUL IT WILL BE FOR US TO COME TO A CONCLUSION. THANKS.
01:14:43.798: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN MOTION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES]

01:15:15.596: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, MAY. IUST WAS BRIING THI U BECAUSE IT JUST -- WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW, ALL THE EVENTS THAT HAVE BEEN CANCELED, SOCIAL DISTANCING THAT'S GOING TO BE ONGOING FOR A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF TIME, WHETHER THIS WAS AN APPROPRIATE MEASURE TO TAKE. I UNDERSTAND IT COULD BE SCRAPPED AT ANY TIME, BUT IT JUST THROWS A LOT OF UNCERTATY INTO THE MIX AND PERHAPS SENDS THE WRONG MESSAGE. WE WILL BE DISCUSSING ROAD CLOSURES A LITTLE LATER ON IN THIS MEETING, AND IT'S GOING TO COMPLICATE MATTERS WHEN IT COMES TO THAT, I DO BELIEVE. I ALSO WOULD OFFER AND I ASKED IT BEFORE, SUGGESTED THAT WHAT -- THIS IS SOMETHING THAT PERHAPS COULD BE MOVED ON TO THE CITY OF THE CENTER, ACTIVATING THAT PART OF OUR DOWNTOWN IS IN DESPERATE NEED OF ACTIVATION AND LIGHT THAT FIRE.ERY GOOD WAYO PERHAPS, YOU KNOW, INCLUDE LIBERTY PLAZA, AND NOT HAVE THE EFFECTS THAT ROAD CLOSURES HAVE ON SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. I MEAN, I JUST TALKED WITH MANY SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS TODAY, BECAUSE OF THE RESOLUTION THAT WE'RE BRINGING FORTH AND ALL OF THEM HAVE SAID ROAD CLOSURES ROAD CSURES HUR OUR BUSESS. TH ARE EXCITED ABOUT -- BY AND LARGE, I KNOW WE HAD ONE PERSON WHO DIDN'T SUPPORT IT HERE, BUT BY AND LARGE, IF YOU HAVE ALL GOTTEN EMAILS TODAY, SUPPORT ROAD CLOSURES FOR THE REASONS THAT WE STATED, BUT FOR OTHER REASONS SUCH AS THESE TYPE OF SPECIAL INTEREST AFFAIRS, THEY REALLY HURT THE SMALL BUSINESSES DOTOWN, AND ITEALLY, I THINK, I POOR TIMING AND I'M SORRY, BUT I JUST -- IT'S HARD FOR ME TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THIS, EVEN THOUGH IT HURTS SMALL BUSINESSES DOWNTOWN.
01:17:22.590: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE. STARTING WIT COUNCMEMBER HAYNER.
01:17:32.366: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES.
01:17:36.137: >> Councilmember Bannister:  I COULDN'T GET MY HAND UP IN TIME, BUT I DO AGREE WITH COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI THAT THIS GREEN FAIR WOULD BE LOVELY ON THE CENTER OF THE CITY AND THEN WE WLDN'T HAV TOLOSE ANY STREETS AND IT WOULD BE ACTIVATING THIS CENTER THE CITY AS VOTER APPROVED AND I'M JUST CONFUSED AS TO WHY WE KEEP CONSISTING TO DO IT SO -- [ GARBLED AUDIO ] BUTTONS WAVED UP IN TIME, BUT WITH COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI'S PERMISSION, I THINK WE SHOULD MAKE A MOTION TO MOVE IT TO AUGUST 14, BUT MOVE IT TO THE CENTER OF THE CITY.
01:18:30.591: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: WELL, I JUST HAVE TO CALL TO DER. I' NOT SURE WHATARLIAMENTARY RULES WOULD BE AT THIS POINT.
01:18:37.398: >> Mayor Taylor: I MEAN, I HAVE STARTED THE VOTE. THERE'S ONLY BEEN ONE PERSON VOTING, BECAUSE -- THANK YOU FOR ASKING COUNCILMEMBER. INSOFAR AS -- YOU KNOW, AS A MATTER OF, YOU KNOW, RIGOROUS PROCEDURE, THE STATEMENT IS OUT OF ORDER. AT THE SAME TIME, YOU KNOW, WE'RE ALL - WE'RE A TRYIN TO GURE THIS OUT AS WE GO ALONG AND COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER INDICATED THERE WAS A TECHNOLOGIC ISSUE AND I DON'T THINK THAT COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER IS PREJUDICED BY HAVING VOTED FOR -- YOU KNOW, AND I'M JUST PREPARED TO JUST LET THAT GO, AND WE'LL -- WE'LL CONTINUE TO ROLL, IF PEOPLE WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS AND SO I GUESS I ULD SAY, COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER STILL HAS THE FLOOR AND IF SHE'S DONE, IT'S COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
01:19:26.280: >> Councilmember Bannister: I'M DONE.
01:19:27.581: >> Councilmember Lumm: IS THAT T AN AMENDMENT. THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR, FOR ALLOWING THIS TO BE DISCUSSED. WERE YOU MAKING AN AMENDMENT?
01:19:36.390: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES, I WAS ASKING COUNCILMEMBER COUNCILMEMBERRAMLAWI, IF HE WASN AMENDMENT, AND IF HE DOESN'T, I WILL MAKE AN AMENDMENT.
01:19:49.603: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I'M NOT PREPARED TO PROPOSE AN AMENDMENT.
01:19:53.441: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
01:19:59.046: >> Councilmember Lumm: MAY I
01:20:00.514: >> Mayor Tlor: I'M SOY, COUNLMEMBER LUMM.
01:20:04.151: >> Councilmember Lumm: SO ON THE MAIN MOTION, STAFF DID INDICATE THAT THIS IS SUBJECT TO CANCELLATION, LIKE EVERY OTHER EVENT. I DO APPRECIATE COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI'S COMMENTS. HE IS -- HE HAS BEEN A HANDS ON FRONT LINE EFFECTIVE SPOKESPEON FOR THE DOWNTOWN BUSINESSES AND ON THIS, WE HAVE RECEIVED FEEDBACK ON -- ON THE BACK OF CONSISTENCY, PERHAPS, TO APPROVE THIS WHILE WE'RE AT THE SAME TIME PROPOSI THESE STREET CLOSURES WHICH NOT ALL BUSINESSES BACK. SOME FEEL, AS WE ALL KNOW THAT IT WILL HURT THEIR BUSINESS, NOT HELP THEIR BUSINESS. AND WE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT PLAN SHORTLY. BUT TO PUT THIS ON TOP OF THAT, I MEAN, THE REASON WE ARE DOING THE CLOSURES IS TO CREATE AS MUCHPACE ON THE SEETS FOR THEM TO OPERATE THIS -- THIS IS -- IS TAKING UP SOME OF THAT SPACE, BASICALLY. AND IT COULD PRESENT A HARDSHIP. SO I THINK TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION, I THINKT MAS SENSE TO N PROCEED AT IS POINT AND MAKE THAT DECISION NOW. SO I AGREE WITH COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:21:39.213: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
01:21:40.147: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WAS JUST READING THROUGH THE RESOLUTION AGAIN, TITLE OF THE RESOLUTION IS TO CHANGE THE DATE, BUT THE STREET CLOSURES ARE MAPPED OUT AND THE TIMES ARE THE SAME. AND IT OCCURS T ME THAT THE -- THE OVERLAP OF THIS AND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO BE REFERRING TO AS YOUR HEALTHY STREETS INITIATIVE ARE -- IS QUITE SIMILAR. IN FACT THESE STREETS MAY ALL ALREADY BE CLOSED FOR -- IF WE APPROVE THESE HEALTHY STREETS INITIATIVE, THEY MAY BE CLOSED ALREADY FOR THOSE TIMES. ONE SAYS 2.M. A THIS SS 3 P.M. NOTION IS TO LET'S JUST GO AHEAD AND CHANGE THE DATE AND THE FLEXIBILITY IS GOING TO EXIST THROUGH THE GOVERNOR'S ORDERS OR FUTURE CONVERSATIONS WE WILL HAVE TONIGHT AND IN THE COMING WEEKS THAT IT MAY BE FRUITFUL TO FIND OUT THAT, YEAH, THE DATES CHANGED BUT THE LOCATION HAS TO CHANGE BECAUSE ETREETS ARE CLOSED BECAUSE THEY ARE FULL OF RESTAURANT TABLES. I'M INCLINED TO SAY YES TO THIS AND CHANGE THE DATES WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS IN FLUX RIGHT NOW, ESPECIALLY ON THE HEELS OF THE GOVERNOR'S RESCISSIOOFHE ST AT HOMERDER.
01:22:57.191: >> Mayoraylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:22:59.893: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. AND APOLOGIZE FOR ADDING MORE TIME TO OUR MEETING, BUT I JUST WANT TO REITERATE THE FACT THAT ALL SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE BEEN PUNCHED, KICKED, STEPPED ON AND SPIT ON BY THEIR GOVERNMENT. THERE'S NOT A WHOLE LOTFS T HERE TT ARE GETNG A WHOLE LOT OF SUPPORT, AND WE NEED CONSISTENCY AND CONFIDENCE. AND BY THROWING A BUNCH OF THINGS UP AND SAYING THIS MAY STICK AND THIS MAY STAND AND THIS MAY NOT, THAT'S NOT GOOD FOR SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS RIGHT NOW, WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO STAY ALIVE. I THINK WE NEED TO BE VERY KILL THE GOLDEN GOOSE THAT WE CALL OUR DOWNTOWN. AND I THINK WE'RE NOT -- WE'RE OUT OF TOUCH WITH THE REALITIES THAT SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS RIGHT NOW ARE DEALING WITH. I MEAN, FRANKLY, SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS NOW NEED CONFIDENCE AND CONSISTENCY. AND THAT'S NOT WHAT WE ARE DOING HERE. I'M SORRY. I GET A LITTLE EMOTIONAL BECAUSE I AM ONE OF THOSE SMALL BUSINESSES.
01:24:14.435: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD. PLEASE HIT THE RAISE HAND BUTTON SO I KNOW WHO IS WHO
01:24:22.676: >> Couilmember Griswd: SORR Mayor Taylo NO WORRIES.
01:24:25.079: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I AGREE WITH WHAT COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI SAID AND I DON'T KNOW THAT IT NEEDS AN AMENDMENT, BUT I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING THAT ANYTHING WE DO DOES NOT NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS FURTHER,ND IF THEY ARE PAYING FOR BARRICADES AND SERVING FOOD IN THE STREETS ON A FRIDAY NIGHT AND THEN WE SAY YOU CAN'T DO IT ON THIS FRIDAY NIGHT, I DON'T THINK THAT'S ACCEPTABLE.

I'M A LONG-TIME CITIZEN OF ANN ARBOR WARD 3 AND PROFESSOR IN THE U OF M MEDICAL SCHOOL. LAST TIME I SPOKE BEFORE CITY COUNCIL WAS ON NOVEMBER 4th, 2019, THAT WAS AN HISTORIC DAY IN ANN ARBOR, THE DAY THAT THE COCIL VOTED UNAMOUSLY TO ADOPT T AMBITIOUS GOAL OF CLIMATE NEUTRALITY BY 2030. I CONGRATULATE YOU FOR TAKING THAT COURAGEOUS AND AMBITIOUS STAND. I'M SPEAKING TONIGHT TO ASK EACH OF YOU TO LOOK AT YOURSELF IN THE MIRROR AND SAY, WHAT WAS THAT JUST A MOMENTARILY WHIM OR AM I SERIOUS ABOUT PROCEEDING WITH ACTION ON THE CLIMATE EMERGENCY? I ASK YOU TO CONSIDER THE OPPORTUNY TOMERGE ASEADERS IN ADDRESSING THE CLIMATE CRISIS. I ASK YOU TO CONSIDER YOUR CONSTITUENTS AND VOTERS WHO I BELIEVE ARE STRONGLY IN SUPPORT OF ACTION ON CLIMATE CHANGE. I ASK YOU NOT TO LET THE COVID PANDEMIC DISTRACT US FROM ACTING ON CLIMATE. THE COVID PANDEMIC HAS NOW CLAIMED 100,000 US LIVES. THAT IS APPROXITELY THE SAME NUMBERS THE NUMBER WHO DIE IN THE US EVERY YEAR FROM PARTICULATE AIR POLLUTION FROM BURNING OF FOSSIL FUELS BUT THIS IS YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR. WITH COVID, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ABDICATED ITS RESPONSIBILITIES AND LEFT IT TO THE STATE AND THEY HE LEDN DEALING WH COVID WITHOME MEASURED SUCCESS. WITH THE CLIMATE CRISIS, BOTH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THE STATES HAVE LARGELY ABDICATED RESPONSIBILITY, BUT MANY COMMUNITIES ARE SEIZING THAT RESPONSIBILITY AND TAKING STRONG ACTIONS ON CLIMATE CHANGE. PLEASE HELP LEAD ANN ARBOR TOWARDS BEING ONE OF THOSE COMMUNITIES. PLEASE DON'T TAKE THAT BECAUSE OF COVID, WE HAVE TOO MH ON OUR PLATE TO ADDSS THE CLIMATE EMERGENCY. YOU ARE ALL CAPABLE LEADERS, AND YOU WITH THE HELP OF YOUR STAFF AND YOUR CITIZENS ARE CAPABLE OF ADDRESSING TWO CRISIS AT THE SAME TIME. PLEASE DIDN'T SAY BECAUSE OF COVID, OUR BUDGET IS TRAINED AND WE SHOULD PUT OFF DEALING WITH CLIMATE UNTIL SOME OTHER TIME. WITH THE CLIMATE CRISIS BECAUSE OF THE ONGOING COST OF HUMAN LIVES AND BECAUSE OF THE CONTRIBUTION TO HEALTHCARE COSTS WHICH BY THEMSELVES EXCEED THE COST OF THE SOLUTIONS. BECAUSE OF ITS POSSIBLE TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF OTHER INFECTIONS, SUCH AS CHOLERA AND WEST NILE VIRUS AND LYME DISEASE AND MA OTHER Clerk Beaudry30 SECONDS
01:32:46.580: >> BECAUSE OF ITS EFFECTS ON MICHIGAN AGRICULTURE, CAUSING ECONOMIC DISRUPTION AND THREATENING OUR FOOD SUPPLY, BECAUSE IT MAY CAUSE MANY DEATHS FROM HEAT WAVES AND FLOODS AND OTHER LOCALES FROM DROUGHT. BECAUSE WITH THE STATUS QUO, CHILDREN BORN TODAY WILL AS THEY AGE LIVE IN A CLIMATE LIKE I ASK YOU T SHOW US TRUE LEADERSHIP TO ADOPT AND SHOW FUNDING FOR THE A2ZERO PLAN IN YOUR DELIBERATIONS TODAY. THANK YOU.
01:33:21.815: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
01:33:26.353: >> Clerk Beaudry: NEXT UP IS CALLER 389. GO AHEAD.
01:33:32.792: >> HELLO. MY NAME IS EMILY THOMPSON. I'M FROM WARD 2, AND I'M A PROFESSOR IN THE BIOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES DEPARTMENT AT WASHTENAW COMMUNITY COLLEGE. TODAY, I REPRESENT ONLY MYSELF AND MY OPINIONS AND I URGE CITY COUNCIL TO UNAMOUSLY SPORT THE ROLUTION ADOPTING THE LIVING A2ZERO ANN ARBOR CARBON NEUTRALITY PLAN. I HAVE LOOKED OVER THE PLAN, AND I SEE THAT EVERY ITEM IS NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE A JUST AND EQUITABLE TRANSITION TO CARBON NEUTRALITY:  THERE ARE A NUMBER OF ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY STRAGIES F DECREASIN GREEN USE GASES. THESE INCLUDE POWERING THE GRID WITH 100% RENEWABLE ENERGY, STRATEGY ONE. SWITCHING APPLIANCES TO ELECTRIC, STRATEGY TWO. IMPROVING BUILDING ENERGY EFFICIENCY, STRATEGY THREE. MOVING TO A MORE PLANT BASED OFFSETS STRATEGY, 7.4. CARBO THERE ARE TWO ADDITIONAL STRATEGIES THAT ARE SUPER IMPORTANT TO ACHIEVE EQUITY AND TO IMPROVE RESILIENCY IS IN OUR AREA. AND THESE ARE STRATEGIES 4 AND 6. THEY ARE ALL ABOUT IMPROVING PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION, AFFORDABLE HOUSING, AND SILIENCY. AND I HAVE A FEW STORIES ABOUT THEM. TRANSPORTATION. ONE OF THE MAJOR REASON THAT ANY STUDENTS ARE LATE TO CLASS, MISS CLASS OR EVEN DROP OUT OF SCHOOL IS LACK OF DEPENDABLE, AFFORDABLE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. WITH THE CONAVUS CAUSING SO MANY INUR AA TO LOSE THEIR JOBS, EVEN MORE STUDENTS WILL FIND GETTING TO SCHOOL A BARRIER TO AN EDUCATION BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD THEIR CARS. IN MY OPINION, TODAY WOULD BE SOON ENOUGH TO START WORKING ON STRATEGIES 4.1, .2, .3, AND .6. I MIGHT NOT BE HERE WITHOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING FROM THE LAST CENTURY. DURING THE GREAT DEPRESSION, MY MOTHER'S FATHER DIED AND MY GRANDMOTHER SOUND A JOB AT THE TELEPHONE COMPANY. COURTESY OF THE HOUSING ACTF NOW IT'S -- Clerk Beaudry: 20 SECONDS.
01:36:04.310: >> AND WE ARE ABOUT TO START OUR NEXT TERRIBLE DEPRESSION AND WE HAVE THE COVID CRISIS, AND PEOPLE IN OUR AREA, INCLUDING MY STUDENTS NEED AFFORDABLE HOUSING. YOU CAN'T START TO WORK ON STRATEGY 4.4 AND 4.5 SOON ENOUGH. FOR MY FAL STORY, I WT TO JUST RELATE QUICKLY THAT AT A TIME WHEN THE PUBLIC GROCERY STORES WERE SHORT ON FLOUR, EGGS, SUGAR AND MILK, THE LOCAL STORES FROM THE FARMER'S MARKET STILL HAD THESE SUPPLIES. CLERK TIME.
01:36:44.084: >> THANK YOU.

01:36:59.432: >> WONDERFUL. GOOD EVENING, MAYOR TAYLOR AND CITY COUNCILMEMBERS MY NAME IS I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THIS EVENING AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE TO THE ANN ARBOR COMMUNITY. I'M CALLING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE A2ZERO PLAN. I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR UNANIMOUSLY DECLARING A CLIMATE EMERGENCY. THIS HAS NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR AGGRESSIVELY SETTING 2030 AS A CARBON NTRALITY TARGE UNDERSTAN THAT THIS TARGET IS FIVE YEARS EARLIER THAN THE DRAFT YOU RECEIVED PROPOSED.

ARBO PLIC SCHOOLS A ASNN SUCH, I WORK WITH THE FUTURE OF OUR COMMUNITY ON A DAILY BASIS. AS A TEACHER, I WORK WITH A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF OUR LATINO AND HISPANIC COMMUNITY. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE MAJORITY OF THEM, IF NOT ALL OF THEM SAY TO ME? THEY CAME TO OUR BEAUTIFUL DIVERSE AND WELCOMING COMNITY NOT F AN OPPORTUNI FOR BEER LIFE FOR THEMSVES, BUT FOR THEIR CHILDREN. OUR CHILDREN. I'M SURE IT'S NOT EASY TO STOMACH SUCH A LARGE INVESTMENT BUT I IMPLORE YOU TO SEARCH YOUR FEELINGS AS YOU KNOW IT TO BE TRUE THAT IF WE DO NOT ACT NOW, I'M AFRAID THE CONSEQUENCES WILL BE CATASTROPHIC. THE COMMUNITY HAS ALREADY SUPPORTED A $1 BILLION AAPS POND ISSUE AND I BELIEVE THIS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY MOVE THIS FORWARD AND TOWARDS CARBON NEUTRALITY, WITH UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN RESPONDING THIS FALL AND THE CITY TAKING THE LEAD. THE MAJOR INSTITUTIONS ALONG WITH YOUR LEADERSHIP CAN HELP MOVE US TOWARD AND MAKE THIS REALITY POSSIBLE. YOU SEE AS A COMMUNITY, WE HAVE TO INVEST IN THE US SUSTAINABLEF OUR PLANET AND OUR CHILDREN WILL LIVE AND THRIVE. WHILE THESE STRATEGIES AND 44 ACTIONS LAID OUT BEFORE US MAY NOT ALL HAVE UNANIMOUS SUPPORT, THEY FORM THE BASIS FOR CONSTRUCTIVE DISCUSSIONS ON HOW WE CAN MOVE FORWARD. IT IS SAI THAT GREAT HUMAN BEINGS PLANT SEEDS OF TREES UNDER WHOSE SHADE WE KNOW THEY WILL NEVER REST UNDER. IT'S OUR DUTY TO PROTECT OUR PLANET.
01:39:30.216: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
01:39:32.051: >> YOUR ACTION IS NOT FOR YOURSELVES BUT FOR THE GRANDCHILDREN OF OUR GRANDCHILDREN. YOU CAN TAKE THE STEP TO SUPPORT THE A2ZERO PLANND PROCTUR COUNITY AND SOCIETY FOR GENERATIONS TO COME. TO QUOTE A SMALL VOICE THAT ONCE SPOKE FOR THE TREES, UNLESS SOMEONE LIKE YOU CARES A WHOLE AWFUL LOT, NOTHING IS GOING TO GET BETTER. IT'S NOT. THANK YOU.
01:39:59.012: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.

01:40:07.654: >> GOOD EVENING. THANK YOU, MAYOR TAYLOR AND COUNCILMEMBERS FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE A FEW COMMENTS ON BEHALF OF DTE ENERGY REGARDING THE LIVING A2ZERO CARBON NEUTRALITY PLAN. MY NAME IS HENRY DECKER AND I'M THE DIRECTOR WITH DTE ENERGY AND A LOCAL RIDENT OF ANN ARBOR WE HAD LONG HISTORY OF PROVIDING RELIABLE ENERGY TO ANN ARBOR AND ITS RESIDENTS AND WITH TAKE PRIDE IN THAT RELATIONSHIP. AT DTE WE ARE ON A SIMILAR JOURNEY. WE HAVE COMMITTED TO REDUCING OUR CARBON EMISSIONS TO NET ZERO 2050 AND ALRDY RUCED THE ELECTRIC EMISSIONS FROM 2005 LEVELS. WE HAVE REVIEWED IN DETAIL THE PLAN YOU HAVE UNDER CONSIDERATION AND SEE MANY OPPORTUNITIES WHERE WE CAN PARTNER WITH YOU ON THIS JOURNEY. FOR EXAMPLE, DEVELOP A CUSTOMIZED RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY SOLUTION THAT PROMOTES RENEWABLES IN MICHIGAN DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTABLE, INCLUDING RENEWABLE ENERGY PROJECTS INCLUDING SOLAR AND WIND. EXPLORE OPPORTUTIES TO VERAGE A VOLUNTARY GREEN NATURAL GAS PROGRAM TO REDUCE UP TO 100% OF THEIR EMISSIONS FROM NATURAL GAS. EXPAND ANN ARBOR'S PARTICIPATION IN THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE PARTICIPATION PROGRAM TO SUPPORT THE VEHICLES AND MASS TRANSITS AND SCHOOL BUSES AND DELIVERY VEHICLES. EXPLORE ARE RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS AS TO HEAVY DUTY, SUCHS REFUSE TRUCKS AND TRACTOR-TRAILERS. PARTNER TO INCREASE ENERGY AWARENESS SO PARTNERS CAN REDUCE THE ENERGY USE AND MANAGING THEIR BILLS. WHILE THERE ARE MANY AREAS TO COLLABORATE ON. THERE ARE TWO ACTIONS OUT OF THE 44 IN THE PLAN THAT WE WANT TO ADDRESS THIS EVENING. THE FIRST CONCERN RELATES TO THE AGGREGATIO OF COMMUNITYHOICE THIS WOULD REQUIRE STATE, TO DEREGULATE ELECTRIC MARKETS, SOMETHING THAT AFFECTS ALL MICHIGAN RESIDENTS AND SOMETHING THAT WE DO NOT SUPPORT. WE BELIEVE THE CITY CAN ACHIEVE 100% RENEWABLES THROUGH OTHER PROGRAMS. THE SECOND CONCERN RELATES TO THE ACTION CAL CALLING FOR RESTRICTING THE USE OF NATURAL GAS THROUGH BUILDING CODE CHANGES. IT MUST TAKE INTO ACCOUNT A FULL CAST OF CONVERSION T OTH ENERGY SRCES FOR RESIDEN AND BUSINESSES, ALONG WITH AN EVALUATION OF THE SECONDARY INFRASTRUCTURE COST. IN CLOSING, WE COMMEND YOU FOR TAKING ON THE TASK AND CHALLENGES OF STRIVING TO ACHIEVE SIGNIFICANT CARBON EMISSIONS BY 2030. WE HAVE PROGRAMS IN PLACE THAT CAN HELP YOU TOWARD THAT GOAL AND HELPS WITH RELIABILITY AND WE LOOKORWARD TO OPPORTUNITIES TO COLLABORA BUT WE URGE YOU TO AVOID APPROACHES THAT COULD UNNECESSARY INCREASE COSTS AND OTHER PATHWAYS FORWARD. THANK YOU.

01:42:59.792: >> THANK YOU. MY NAME IS JENNIFER FIKE AND I'M A WARD ONE RESIDENT AND AN ANN ARBOR RESIDENT FOR 32 YEARS. I'M THE CURRENT CHAIR OF THE GREEN BELT ADVISORY COMMISSION. 16 YEARS AGO, ANN ARBOR VOLTERS OVERWHELMINGLY VOTED TO APPROVE A MILLAGE TO PROTECT FARM LAND I HOP TT COUIL WILL NOW TAKE ANOTHER BOLD AND CRITICAL STEP IN ADOPTING THE ANN ARBOR CASH OP NEUTRALITY PLAN. WE CANNOT WAIT ANY LONGER AND DELAY IN THE IMPORTANT STEPS TO FUND THIS MUCH NEEDED PLAN. IN MY WORK IN NONPROFIT FINANCE, I UNDERSTAND AND RECOGNIZE THE WEIGHING CT BENITS OPRUDENT AND EXPENS. THE BENEFITS OF THIS PLAN FAR OUTWEIGH THE COSTS. THE COSTS WILL INCREASE DRASTICALLY IF WE DO NOT TAKE ACTION NOW. THIS IS A FINANCIAL INVESTMENT IN OUR FUTURE. BE BOLD AND BE LEADERS. SHOW OUR CHILDREN THAT YOU CARE ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OUR PLANET AND ADOPT THIS PLAN NOW. THANK YOU.

01:44:21.641: >> I'M A UNIVERSITY OF MICHIG STUDT ANDOLITICAL ORGIZER. LIKE MANY OTHERS TONIGHT, I'M HERE TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF THE A2ZERO CARBON NEUTRALITY PLAN, THE PLAN REPRESENTS EXCELLENT, DECISIVE ACTION TOWARDS WHAT WE KNOW IS A NECESSARY GOAL AND THERE ARE A WIDE RANGE OF CRITICAL TOPICS RELATED TO THE PLAN, AND ITS OPPOSITION THAT DESERVE ATTENTION. HOWEVER, I WANT TO FOCUS THE SPEECH ON WHAT IS LIKELY THE MOST -- THE MOST IMPORTANT A MOST ORLOOKED ASPECT OF THI PLAN. THE FACT THAT IT CENTERS EQUITY AND JUSTICE IMPLICITLY ACKNOWLEDGING WHAT DECADES OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH HAVE DEMONSTRATED, THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS NECESSARILY A RACIAL JUSTICE ISSUE. UNFORTUNATELY OVER THE PAST FEW WEEKS WE HAVE OBSERVED AN ALARMING TREND AMONG THE COUNCILMEMBERS THAT OPPOSE THE PLAN AND THE COMMUNITY ALLIES A REMARKABLY OUSE,UT STEADFAST ARGUMENT THAT EQUITY AND JUST VOICE NOTHING TO DO WITH CARBON NEUTRALITY. I KNOW MANY OF YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A BASELESS AND DANGEROUS NOTION, I HAVE BEEN ALARMED BY THE AMOUNT OF TIMES I HAVE HEARD IT STATED. AS AN ARAB AND MUSLIM WOMAN IN THIS COMMUNITY THIS IS ESPECIALLY A SLAP IN THE FACE. WE HAVE DONE VERY LTLE T A UPON T CLIMATE EMERGENCY. THIS IT'S CLOUDED BY OUR OBSESSION WITH OUR BEAUTIFUL GREENERY AND FLOWING RIVERS. LET ME DISMANTLE THIS RACIST NOTION WITH A FEW EXAMPLES. ON A GLOBAL SCALE, WE SHOULD ALL KNOW THAT THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE WILL HIT HARDEST TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE CONTRIBUTED THE LEAST. INDIGENOUS PEOPLES WORWIDE THAT LEN LOW-LYING ISLANDS AND MORE FREQUENT AND INTENSE STORMS OR INDIGENOUS PEOPLE OF NORTH AMERICA HAVE LOST ACCESS TO THE KEY TRADITIONAL FOOD SOURCES. WE HEARD THESE EXAMPLES, BUT THE RELATEDNESS OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND JUSTICE IS QUITE VISIBLE EVEN HERE IN WASHTENAW COUNTY. FOR EXAMPLE, AS YOU SHOULD ALL OW, IT' IMPOSBLE T LIVE IN ANN ARBOR ON A MINIMUM WAGE SALARY. THE TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF FOLKS WHO LIVE HERE CANNOT AFFORD TO LIVE HERE AND MOST COMMUTE HERE, THAT'S BURNING FOSSIL FUELS. THE WORSE INEQUALITY GETS, THE MORE DIFFICULT IT BECOMES TO LIVE IN ANN ARBOR WITHOUT A SIX FIGURE SALARY. IF YOU CONTINUE TO MAKE IT IMPOSSIB FOR YOUR WTERS, YOUR MECHANICS, YOUR RETAIL WORKERS TO LIVE HERE, YOU ARE LOCKING US INTO INTO PERPETUALLY RISING CARBON EMISSIONS MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE FOLKS WHO YOU RELY TO LIVE HERE, IS ESSENTIAL.
01:46:52.158: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
01:46:53.993: >> IMPROVING PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. INEQUALITY AND CARBO FT PRI GO HAND IN HAND AND YOU KNOW THIS. THIS BEGS THE QUESTION, WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON? YOUR VULNERABLE CONSTITUENTS OR DTE? WE ARE WATCHING YOU AND IF YOU VOTE AGAINST THE MARGINALIZED MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY, AND VOTING AGAINST THIS WILL DIRECTLY HARM THE MARGINALIZED MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY, WE WILL VOTE YOU OUT.

01:47:32.398: >> THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO THOROUGHLY CONSIDER THE A2ZERO CARBON NEUTRALITY. MY NAMES MAR SCHIBER. I'M THE GREAT LAKES REGIONAL EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL WILDLIFE FOUNDATION, THAT WORK IN PART ON CLIMATE RESILIENCY. I SAT ON THE ENERGY COMMISSION FOR APPROXIMATELY THE LAST TEN YEARS AND I HOLD A Ph.D. IN ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY AND TEACH CLIMATE POLICY AT U OF M. THE PLAN BEFORE YOU IS TREMENDOUS. DR. STULTS AND HER TEAM HE DONE THE IMPOSSIBLE,Y PROVIDG AN AMBITIOUS YET ACHIEVABLE PLAN WITH INCREDIBLE COMMUNITY INPUT, DETAILED ANALYSIS AND A CLEAR PLAN AND PATHWAY. IT IS BROUGHT TO YOU WITH GREAT EWE MILLITY, THE UNDERSTAND -- HUMILITY AND UNDERSTANDING THAT UNCERTAINTY REMAINS AND PLANS CHANGE AS WE LEARNED PAINFULLY IN THESE PAST FEW MONTHS AND THIS PLAN AS YOU JUST HEARD I CAN'T TNK OF A BETTER TIMEND TO FOCUS ON EQUITY AND JUSTICE, AS THIS PLAN DOES. MY MESSAGE TO YOU IS THAT THIS IS A CLEAR AND WATERSHED VOTE. YOU EITHER STAND ON THE SIDE OF CLIMATE ACTION AND LEADERSHIP FOR THE ANN ARBOR COMMUNITY OR YOU WILL STAND AGAINST IT. IT'S REALLY THAT SIMPLE. YET, THE TEXT OF THE RESOLUTION MAKES IT CLEARHAT TS IS A VOTE AUT PINSND PLANNINGS. PLANNING NOT THE -- PRINCIPLES AND PLANNINGS. PLANNING. ALL MAJOR BUDGETARY AND LAND USE DECISIONS WILL GO BACK TO COUNCIL INDIVIDUALLY. SO THIS IS NOT A TIE YOUR HANDS MOMENT FOR A VOTE, BUT RATHER A DON'T LIMIT THE POSSIBILITIES, BUT IT'S ABOUT VISION. AND COUNCIL HAS DONE A GREAT JOB OF SETTING THE VISION, ASKING FO ALAN TO REACH CARBON NEUTRALITY BY 2030, DECLARING A CLIMATE EMERGENCY, MAINTAINING CLIMATE FUNDING SO FAR, EVEN IN THE MIDST OF POTENTIALLY TERRIBLE BUDGET TIMES AND VOTING FOR OUR PAST CLIMATE PLANS THAT GOT US ON THIS PATH AS MANY OF YOU HAVE DONE. UNFORTUNATELY, IN MY EXPERIENCE ON THE ENERGY COMMISSION, I HAVE SEEN MANY RED HERRINGS PUT OUT BY THOSE WHO ARE NOT FAVABLE TO CLIMATE ACTION. ENDLESS PROCESSES THAT NEVER END IN AN OUTCOME, CLIMBING THAT CLT HAS A MAGIC POWER OF LAW AND MISLEADING OF WHAT THIS PLAN WILL COST. COMMITY THAT FILLEDOURS INBOXES, PUT UP CLIMATE VOTER SIGNS ALL OVER THIS COMMUNITY AND FROM YOUTH WHOSE ENERGY ON THIS IS CONTAGIOUS AND MUST BE HEARD. THE VOTE TODAY IS CLEAR.
01:50:01.680: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
01:50:03.182: >> AGGRESSIVELY V YET RESPONSIB. A VOTE FOR THE PLAN MOVES US FORWARD AND ALLOWS CONVERSATIONS A VE AGAINSTHIS ALLOWS US STUCK IN NEUTRAL OR WORTH. I HOPE YOU WILL BE WITH YOUR CONSTITUENTS AND BACK THE PAST ACTIONS AND BE ON THE SIDE OF SCIENCE AND VOTE YES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

01:51:04.677: >> MY NAME IS VINCE CARUSO, 556, FIFTH WARD. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO THIS RESOLUTION. EAKING ON THE WATERSHED GROUP. AND I THINK THAT WE HAVE GREAT OPPORTUNITIES TO REDUCE OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT IN ANN ARBOR AND MICHIGAN. I THINK WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE MISSTEPS. FOR EXAMPLE, THAT THE A2ZERO, MEETING -- THE INAUGURAL MEETING, IN ONE OF THE BREAKOUT SESSIONS, I ASKED DR. MISSY STULTS IF SHE SUPPORTED THE IDEA OF BUILDING IN A FLOODPLAIN WITH ALL THE IDEAS THAT WE HAVE MORE FLOODING AND MORETORMS. SHE SAID ABSOLUTELOT, SHE DOES NOT SPORT BUILDING IN THE FLOOD PLAINS AND YET THE CITY IS PUSHING FORWARD ON MANY FRONTS TO DO EXACTLY THAT, BUILD IN THE FLOODPLAINS PANE IN SOME CASES THE FLOODWAY BECAUSE -- AND IN MANY SOME CASES, THE FLOODWAY BECAUSE THE FLOODPLAIN MAPS BY OVER 30%, BY SOME CALCULATIONS. I THINK, YOU KNOW, THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR TO MOVE FORWARD. I THINK UNFORTUNATELY, WE HAVE MADE SOME REAL MISTAKES IN BLOCKING MORE HOMEOWNERS USING SOLAR PANELS WHEN WE TAXED SOLAR PANELS IN ANN ARBOR. AND WHEN A FEW CITIES IN MICHIGAN DID THAT AND IT TOOK THE STATE OF MICHIN TO PASS TH LEGISLATION TO FORCE ANN ARBOR TO STOP DOING THAT. I THINK THAT WAS A MISTAKE. I DON'T THINK WE ARE DOING WHAT WE SAY WE DO AND NOT JUST HAVE THESE GRANDIOSE PLANS. IT'S AMAZING THIS PLAN IS PROPOSING A $1 BILLION COST, VERY F MEETINGSHERE PEOPLEP. CAN DISCUSS SOME OF THE ISSUES THEY HAVE. FOR EXAMPLE, HAVING A PROPOSAL TO HAVE QUADRY PLEXES THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE CITY AS A MATTER OF RIGHTS, HOMEOWNERS CANNOT CHALLENGE THAT. I THINK THAT'S A REAL ISS. 'RE FACIN MAJ BUDGET CUTS, AND AS YOU HAVE SAID, JUST THE HOSPITAL ALONE WILL LOSE $2 BILLION ALONE THIS YEAR.
01:53:41.133: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
01:53:42.034: >> AND THE SCHOOLS WILL LOSE PROBABLY ANOTHER $1 BILLION. IF WE GO TO TALL BUILDINGS AS INPUT AND HAVE A LOT OF CARBONL USAGE DURING THEIR LIFETIME. I THINK WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL THAT WE DON'T OVERBUILD OUR CITY AND CAUSE MORE CARBON HARM THAN WE SAY WE ARE. THANKS SO MUCH.
01:54:06.725: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
01:54:10.762: >> Clerk Beaudry: NEXT UP IS CALLER 9. CALLER 922, GO AAD.
01:54:16.301: >> HELLO?
01:54:18.904: >> Mayor Taylor: HI, YES, WE CAN HEAR.
01:54:23.142: >> HI, MY NAME IS HEATHER ZHANG, THANK YOU FOR SERVING AND LISTENING. I NEVER CALLED INTO A PUBLIC HEARING, BEFORE BUT ANN ARBOR'S OPPORTUNITY TO BE A LEADER IN THE CLIMATE ISS IS REALLY IMPORTT TO ME. I MOVED HERE NINE YEARS AGO TO ATTEND U OF M. I RECENTLY GOT MY MASTER OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND AM INTERNING AT MONT CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL BEFORE BECOMING A REGISTERED DIETITIAN. NOW I'M A VOTING RESIDENT OF WARD 5 IN ANN ARBOR. I CAN TAKE STEPS TO REDUCE MY CARBOOTPRINT ON AERSONAL LEVEL, SUCH AS DRIVING LESS OR TAKING SHORTER SHOWERS BUST I ALSO WANT TO LIVE IN A WIDER COMMUNITY THAT IS TAKING A LEAD IN ACHIEVING CLIMATE NEUTRALITY. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE COUNCIL DECLARED A CLIMATE EMERGENCY AND MOVED UP THE CARBON NEUTRALITY TARGET TO 2030. ALSO THANK YOU FOR PROVIDING SUPPORT TO T OFFICE OF STAINABILITYND INNOVATION. CARBON NEUTRALITY IS A DAUNTING GOAL AND REQUIRES UP FRONT INVESTMENT OF TIME, MONEY, AND INTERDISCIPLINARY COLLABORATION, HOWEVER, NOW IS THE TIME TO INVEST THESE THINGS IN OUR COMMUNITY. THERE'S A QUOTE THAT SAYS, WE DID NOT INHERIT THE EARTH FROM OUR ANCESTORS. DESCENDANTD IT FM OUR AS COUNCILMEMBERS, YOU HAVE THE CHANCE TO LEAVE A POSITIVE LEGACY TO FUTURE GENERATIONS. I HOPE YOU VOTE TO APPROVE THE A2ZERO PLAN. IT BUILDS ON SEVEN VITAL STRATEGIES TO REDUCE THE CITY'S CARBON EMISSIONS. PLEASE TAKE A STEP FORWARD WITH THE A2ZERO PLAN AND SHO THAT TH CNCILALUES LEAVI A POTIVE LONG-TERM IMPACT ON OUR COMMUNITY. THANK YOU.

01:56:20.292: >> MY NAME IS CHRISTEN HAYDEN. I'M A RESIDTS O 520 WALNUT STREET AND I VE IN WARD TWO. I LIVED AND WORKED IN ANN ARBOR FOR 20 YEARS AT THIS POINT. I'M HERE TO ADVOCATE THAT YOU PASS THE A2ZERO PLAN AND BEFORE I GET INTO THE REASONS, I WANT TO GIVE A BIG SHOUT OUT TO THE OFFICE OF SUSTAINABILITY AND INNOVATION AND THE MANY EXPERT COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO MADE THIS PLAN A BEAUTIFUL COMPLEX THING THAT IT IS. IN MY TIME, I WT T TK AUT HOW THIS UNPRECEDENTED PANDEMIC IS NOT A REASON TO SET ASIDE CARBON NEUTRALITY EFFORTS WHICH OTHERS BEFORE ME HAVE MADE. THIS NOT ONLY ADDRESSES CLIMATE ISSUES BUT INCLUDING THE HEALTH, JUSTICE AND ECONOMIC CRISIS FACING US. IT PROVIDES A WAY TO PROMOTE THE KIND OF SOCIETAL CHANGE THAT WE NEED AND A HEALTHY, HELUL AND UITABLE WAY. WE KNOW THAT CLIMATE CHANGES REPRESENTS THE PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. THE EMERGENCE AND THE THREAT OF NEW INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND IT ALSO INTENSIFIES FOOD INSECURITIES, AND IT WILL PUT MILLIONS IN HOSPITALS IN COMING YEARS. TH A2ZERO PN, WHILE ITOES NOT SOLVE IT, THEY CUT THEIR OWN EMISSIONS AND THEREFORE A VITAL PIECE OF GLOBAL CARBON NEUTRALITY. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF ACTIONS THAT WILL DIRECTLY ENHANCE THE CRISIS, THE AFTERMATH OF THE PANDEMIC AND OTHER SUCH HEALTH CRISES. FOR EXAMPLE, WE KNOW THAT GREEN HOUSE GAS EMISSNS CAUSE RESPATORY ILLNESSES THAT MAKE PEOPLE MUCH MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO DISEASES LIKE COVID. PAIRS WITH THIS, THE INPRESSIVELY ROBUST TO INCREASE NEIGHBORHOOD RESILIENCE, CREATING RESILIENCE HUBS AND PREPAREDNESSITS AND IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT IN A PANDEMIC AND IN FUTURE TIMES AS WELL. IN FACT, THEY CLOSELY MIRROR STRATEGIES THAT HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED EFFECTIVELY ACROSS THE UNITED STATES AND ACROSS ANN ARBOR AND YPSILANTI. THIS PLAN REPRESENTS A CRITICAL INVESTMENT IN OUR COMMUNITY'S HEALTH, SAFETY AND REGRET, THAT WILL SENHE U AREPARE FOR T CRISIS WE KW ARE COMING. AUSTERITY MEASURES WILL NOT HELP US. THANK YOU. THAT'S ALL.

01:59:00.085: >> HI, MY NAME IS LOGAN VERIN, AND I'M A 21-YEAR-OLD LIVING IN WARD 3 OF ANN ARBOR. AND I'M HERE TO SUPPORT THE A2ZERO CARBON NEUTRALITY PLAN. MANY COMPONENTS OF THIS PLAN RECOGNIZE MY CONCERNS AND ADDRESS NEEDS SPECIFIC TO MY DEMOGRAPHIC AND WILL PUSH ANN ARBOR TOWARDS THE MOR JUST AND LIVABLE FUTURE. SINCE MOST YOUNG PEOPLE AND STUDENTS LIVING IN ANN ARBOR DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO CARS, THE INCLUSION OF LOCAL AND REGIONAL TRANSIT IN THE PLAN WILL NOT ONLY GIVE YOUTH ACCESS TO A TRANSPORTATION THAT IS ESSENTIAL TO THEIR LIVES, BUT ALSO HELP THEM EXPLORE THE CITY AND THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY AND ESTABLISH A BETTER SENSE OF LIFE. THE EXPANON OF PUBLIC TRANSPT AND IRASTRUCTUREO SUPPORT NON-MOTORIZED TRANSPORTATION WILL DIRECTLY IMPROVE THE MOBILITY AND THE SAFETY OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY. THE WE WILL H WE  DEVELOPMENT OE WILL -- IT WILL BE ESPECIALLY IMPACTFUL FOR YOUNG PEOPLE. IF YOUNG PEOPLE IN ANN ARBOR HAD THE ABILITY TO WALK OR BIKE TO GROCERY STOS T ENTERINMENT VENUES ANDOCALHOPS,HEY WOULD FEEL EMPOWERED TO HAVE A MUCH MORE ACTIVE ROLE AS A PARTICIPANT AND CITIZEN OF ANN ARBOR. STUDENTS AND YOUTH WITH DISABILITIES WOULD EXPERIENCE FEWER BARRIERS THAT SET THEM APART FROM THEIR ABLE-BODY PEERS AS WELL. THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY PORTION OF THE PLAN SUPPORTS LOW-INCOME YOUTH BY SAVING COSTS THROUGH PURCHASING REUSED A REFURBISHED ITEMS. ADDITIONALLY RESILIENCE HUBS WOULD PROVIDE THE SPACE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR YOUNGER STUDENTS AND CITIZENS TO RECEIVE SUPPORT FOR WHATEVER THEY MAY ENCOUNTER THAT BEING SCHOOL WORK, COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT AND EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE. THE YOUTH AMBASSADORS PROGRAM WOULD ALLOW YOUNG PEOPLE TO FEEL EDUCATED, PREPARED, AND EMPOWERED TO FACE THE CLIMATE CRIS WITH THEIRWN COMMUNITY. IT WL FOSTER RESILIENCE AND AUTONOMY IN YOUR FUTURE LEADERS AND WILL BUILD THE FORCE OF MOTIVATED YOUTH THAT WILL ULTIMATELY CARRY OUT THE VISION OF CARBON NEUTRALITY IN ANN ARBOR. THIS CLIMATE NEUTRALITY PLAN SHOWS THAT ANN ARBOR IS A COMMUNITY THAT RECOGNIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF THEIR YOUNG PEOPLE, AND IS MOTIVATED TO CREATE A FUTURE THAT UNDSTDS AND INCORPORATETHEIR INPUT. YOUNG PPLE WANT TO LIVE IN ANN ARBOR BECAUSE THEY SEE A PROGRESSIVE CITY THAT CLIMBS TO REFLECT ARE, DIVERSITY, INCLUSION AND ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY. WHILE THIS MAY BE THE REPUTATION THAT ANN ARBOR HAS, IN MANY WAYS THIS IS NOT LIVED UP. TO THE A2 ZO2 ZERO CARBON NEUTRY TRULY EQUITABLE AND FORWARD IS THINKING.

02:02:02.567: >> GOOD EVENING, MAYOR TAYLOR AND MEMBERS OF THE CITY COUNCIL, I'M JAN CULBERTSON, SPEAKING OF THE CHAIR OF THE 2030 DISTRICT LEADERSHIP COUNCIL. UNANIMOUSLY, DECLARING A CLIMATE EMGENCY SHOWSHE TYPE OF LEADERSHIP WE NEE AT EVERY LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT. SETTING THE 2030 TARGET WAS BOLD AND THE OFFICE OF SUSTAINABILITY AND INNOVATION WORKED DILIGENTLY TO DEVELOP THE PLAN THAT CAN GET US THERE. AS PART OF THIS PROCESS, WE RECOGNIZE THAT GETTING TO CARBON NEUTRALITY IS HARD AND REQUIRES A COMMUNITY-WIDE TRANSFORMATION, AND THE ENTIRE CMUNITY'S BES FORTS. ONGOING LEADERSHIP WILL BE NEEDED TO KEEP FOCUSED ON THIS COMMON GOAL, YET BE FLEXIBLE FROM FUNDING ALTERNATIVES THAT GET US AROUND THE MULTIPLE BARRIERS TO IMPLEMENTING THE SEVEN FUNDAMENTAL AND NECESSARY STRATEGIES. AS ONE OF THE 64 PARTNERS OF A2ZERO, THE ANN ARBOR 2030 DISTRICT POLICEMENS ITS COMMITMENT TO ENGAGE AND TRANORM THE COMMISSNER AND THE MULTIBUILDING SECTOR. WE HAVE A GREAT START WITH 50 BUILDINGS RANGES FROM 2500 SQUARE FOOT TO WELL OVER 100,000, ALL WHO HAVE COMMITTED TO REDUCE ENERGY, WATER USE, AND CO2 EMISSIONS BUT ADOPTION OF THE MA PLAN IS CRITICAL TO INCREASING THE SPEED AND THE IMPACT OF OUR WORK. THE DRA PLA I HELD UP B LEADERSHIP B THE 2030 NETWORK WHICH ENGAGES 22 CITIES ACROSS NORTH AMERICA. JUST ANNOUNCING THE DRAFT PLAN ITSELF HAS INCREASED INTEREST IN DISTRICT MEMBERSHIP AND OPENED A NEW POTENTIAL FUNDING OPPORTUNITY. WITH THE PLAN'S ADOPTION, IT PROVIDES A CLEAR SIGNAL THAT ANN ARBOR IS SERIOUS AND TAKING THE STEPS NECESSARY TO CREATE A SUSTNABILITY FURE FOR THE BUSISSES, INSTITUONS, THE RESIDENTS AND VISITORS. ANN ARBOR HAS THE CAPACITY AND CAN MUSTER THE RESOURCES TO MEET THE CHALLENGE, MORE THAN MOST CITIES OF OUR SIZE. WE HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO LEAD, AND SMOOTHING OUT THE BUMPS ALONG THE WAY FOR OTHERS. I'M BUOYED BY THE EXPERTISE OF THOSE WHO WERE ENGAGED IN DEVELOPING AND SPORTING THE IMPLEMENTION OF THISLAN. FUNDING IS ALSO AVAILABLE TO CITIES AND ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE THE CAPACITY TO LEAD. TO MOVE FORWARD, WE NEED AN ADOPTED LIVING PLAN WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT WE WILL WORK TO RESOLVE THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE RAISED. AND THE PLAN WISELY PROVIDES THE PROVESS FOR ONGOING COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND --
02:04:26.678: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
02:04:27.879: >> LEADERSHIP IS A CRITICAL FACTOR IN DETERMINING WHETHER WE REACH CARBON NEUTRALITY BY 2030 OR AT ALL. THE ANN ARBOR 2030 DISTRICT IS EAGER TO MOVE FORWARD IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR AND THE COMMUNITY WE ALL LOVE AND SERVE. THANK YOU FOR TAKING THESE BOLD STEPS. WE'RE WITH YOU.

02:04:56.608: >> THANK YOU SO MUCH, MY NAME IS SOLOMON MEDENZ, I'M HERE TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF THE CARBON NEUTRALITY PLAN AND ALSO WANT TO LIFT UP WHAT ZANAB SAID EARLIER. I JUST GRADUATED FROM U E OF M, WITHOUT SECURE EMPLOYMENT, I WILL NOT TRY TO MAKE A SALES PITCH FOR YOU, WHY YOU SHOULD PAY ME TO HELP MAKE THIS PLAN A REALITY. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP. IT'S INSPIRING FOR THE CITY COUNCIL TO TAKE THE UNPRECEDENTED STEPS OF DECRING THIS STEP.ERGEN AND TAKING STEPPING UP IN A POWERFUL WHEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. YOU UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION AND ACTED UPON IT. AND THE YOUNG PEOPLE HERE, IT MEANS MORE THAN YOU CAN KNOW. YOU NOW HAVE A CRITICAL OPPORTUNITY TO DEMONSTRATE YOUR LEADERSHIP. WHILE THE STEPS YOU HAVE TAKEN HAVE BEEN MEANINGFUL AND POWERFUL, THEY HAVE BEEN LARGELY SYMBOLIC. THESE ARE CRITICAL FIRST STEPS THE STA AND THE COUNTRY THAT YOU ARE TAKING THIS CRISIS SERIOUSLY, BUT THE TIME HAS COME TO TRANSLATE THESE SYMBOLIC ACTS AND ACTIONS. WE KNOW THAT EVERYONE HERE BELIEVES IN CLIMATE CHANGE. THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE. IN 2020, SIMPLY BELIEVING IN CLIMATE CHANGE IS NOT ENOUGH AND WE NEED MEASURABLE ACTION. AND T THE REASO THAT YOU PUT IT OFF FOR OVE A MONTH, WE KNOW THAT YOU ARE NOT SERIOUS. WE KNOW IT PRESENTS A SERIOUS CHANGE AND THAT IT'S A TREMENDOUS FINANCIAL IMPACT BUT WE KNOW IT WILL TRANSFORM OUR COMMUNITY FOR THE BETTER IN A MULTITUDE OF WAYS EVEN OUTSIDE THE IMMEDIATE BENEFIT. EXPANDED TRANSIT AND BIKE LANES WILL MAKE IT EASIER TO GET EXPANDINGHE TE CANOPY WILL MAKE OUR PARKS EVEN LOVELIER. THIS WILL STRENGTHEN OUR MAYBE NEIGHBORHOODS. IT'S AN INVESTMENT IN MAKING THE DOWN WE LOVE A SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER PLACE FOR EVERYONE WHO LIVES HERE. SO WE IMPLORE YOU TO PLEASE NOT GIVE INTO YOUR RELUCTANCE SIMPLY BECAUSE IT FEELS TOO BIGND FFERENT. IT HAS TO B DIFFENT. IF WE ARE TO LISTEN TO SCIENTISTS, WHICH I HOPE WE ARE, WE HAVE NO CHOICE. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO STAND ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF HISTORY. STAND WITH YOUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN. STAND WITH THE OPPRESSED PEOPLES ACROSS THE GLOBE WHO WILL FEEL THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE WITH A FAR GREATER INTENSITY THAN WE EVER WILL. WHEN YOU MAKE THIS VOTE TONHT, DOT LET THA OUTF YR SIGHT.

02:07:31.863: >> MAYOR TAYLOR, COUNCIL. MY NAME IS MIKE GARFIELD. I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE ECOLOGY CENTER. THE2ZERO PLAN AND TAKE THEPROVE LONG VIEW. ON THIS DAY 50 YEARS AGO, JUNE 1, 1970, A COUPLE OF MONTHS AFTER ANN ARBOR'S FIRST AND LARGEST IN THE COUNTRY EARTH DAY EVENTS, THE ECOLOGY CENTER WAS FOUNDED. OVER THE DECADES WE HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN VIRTUALLY EVERY MAJOR ENVIRONMENTAL INITIATIVE IN THIS COMMUNITY, AND MANY MORE ACSS THETATEND COUNTRY. PERSONALLY HAVE BEEN RAISING THESE ISSUES TO YOU AND YOUR PREDECESSORS FOR MORE THAN HALF OF THOSE 50 YEARS. AND JUST ABOUT EVERY INSTANCE WHEN THE ANN ARBOR CITY COUNCIL HAS DEBATED A HIGHLY CONTROVERSIAL ENVIRONMENTAL INITIATIVE, WHETHER IT WAS TRANSIT, YOUAME I IT TOOK ONLY AOUPLE OF YEARS AFTER THAT VOTE FOR A COMMUNITY CONVENE US IS TO EMERGE THAT COUNCIL HAD DONE THE RIGHT THING. I SUGGEST THAT IF YOU APPROVE THE A2ZERO CARBON NEUTRALITY PLAN TONIGHT, THE COMMUNITY CONSENSUS WILL BEGIN TO EMERGE AROUND IT TOO AND THE PROCESS WILL KK START AND THE RL WORKF FIGHTING THE CLIMATE CRISIS, AND IF YOU READ THE CLIMATE LITERATURE, YOU KNOW THAT THE REAL WORK IS HARD TO FATHOM. THE PREEMINENT SOURCE ON THE SUBJECT, THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE SUGGESTS THAT, QUOTE, IT WILL TAKE A TRANSFORMATION OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AT A PACE AND SCALE THAT HAS NO PCEDENT,NQUOTE. AT'S WHAT MAKES THIS ISSUE FFERENT FROM THE EARLIER ONES I MENTIONED. IT IS FAR MORE COMPLEX. WHO THOUGHT, FROM. , THAT LAND USE IS AN IMPORTANT CLIMATE SOLUTION? MOST PEOPLE DON'T SEE THE CONNECTION BUT, YES, IT IS CRITICAL. WHEN YOU DECLARED THE CLIMATE EMERGENCY LAST YEAR, AND ESTABLISHED A 203 CARBON NEUTLITY TARGET, YOU DID A VERY IMPORTANT THING. YOU FORMALLY PROCLAIMED, ESSENTIALLY THAT WE WOULD NEED TO TRANSFORM OUR LOCAL ECONOMY AT A PACE AND SCALE WITHOUT PRECEDENCE. THE A2ZERO PLAN IS A SORT OF ROADMAP ABOUT HOW TO DO THAT, ORGANIZED AROUND SEVEN ESSENTIAL STRATEGIES. BY APPROVING THE PLAN, YOU WERE SENTIALLY APPVING THEEVEN STRATEGIES. I URGE YOU TO FOCUS YOUR ATTENTION THERE. THE ACTION STEPS, ON THE OTHER HAND, ARE ANOTHER THING ENTIRELY. AS --
02:10:01.145: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS. -- THOSE STEPS WILL HAVE TO CHANGE. BECAUSE CIRCUMSTANCES, TECHNOLOGY AND POLITICS WILL CHANGE. SAVE THE ARGUMENTS OVER THOSE FOR ANOTHER NIGHT. I HAVE GOT ARGUMENTS AGAINST SOME OF THEM MYSF. YOU WILLE DEBATG T DETAILS OF THE ACTION STEPS OVER THE COMING MONTHS AND YEARS. THE RESOLUTION TONIGHT IS A BIG DECISION BUT IT'S ONLY THE START. 50 YEARS FROM NOW, I HOPE OUR KIDS AND GRANDKIDS LOOK BACK ON THIS MOMENT IN HISTORY AND SAY THAT OUR COMMUNITY AND OTHERS ALL OVER THE WORLD DID THE RIGHT THING ON CLIMATE CHANGE BEFORE IT WAS TOO LATE. PLEASE VOTE YES ON THE2ZERO PLAN. THANK YOU.
02:10:40.118: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
02:10:42.954: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER 295. CALLER 295, GO AHEAD.
02:10:47.191: >> YEAH, GOOD EVENING, MY NAME IS HEIDI KESTER. I'M A SECOND WARD VOTER AND A MEMBER OF THE WASHTENAW CHAPTER OF THE CLIMATE REALITY PROJECT AND I'M HERE TO URGE URGEOUR SUPPT OF ANN ARBOR CARBON NEUTRALITY PLAN OR A2ZERO. YOU WILL VOTE ON WHETHER TO APPROVE THE PLAN AFTER MONTHS OF CAREFUL DEVELOPMENT WITH EXTENSIVE INPUT FROM THE COMMUNITY, CITY STAFF AND CITY COUNCIL. GETTING TO THIS POINT IS A SIGNIFICANT ACHIEVEMENT AND I APPRECIATE COUNCIL'S LEADERSHIP IN IN FACILITATING THE TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK TO DATE. TONIGHT'SOTE IS A CHANCE A RARE HISTORIC CHANCE OF TRULY CREATING A POSITIVE LASTING LEGACY. YOU CAN CAST THE VOTE IN FAVOR OF A PLAN THAT DEFINES REAL ACTION IN THE FACE OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS. SO MUCH HAS BEEN BROKEN IN OUR SOCIETY, IN OUR WORLD, AND WE COLLECTIVELY ARE LARGELY RESPONSIBLE. SO MANY PROBLEMS WEIGH ON USO AVILY. ANN ARBOR ASPIRES TO BE A FORCE FOR GOOD, A BEACON FOR PROGRESS AND AN EXAMPLE THAT OTHERS CAN FOLLOW. YOU HAVE A CHANCE TONIGHT TO ACT IN A WAY THAT REPAIRS, PROTECTS, AND ENHANCES TO COUNTERACT DESPAIR AND DESTRUCTION. IT'S A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY AND A DAUNTING RESPONSIBILITY. INDIVIDUALS CANNOT SOLVE THE CLIMATE CRISIS ON TIR OWN, AND IT CERINLY CLEARY NOW THAT WE CAN'T WAIT FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO WAIT IN ANY MEANINGFUL WAY. THE CITIES LIKE ANN ARBOR ARE UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING TO MITIGATE CLIMATE CHANGE, AND QUITE LITERALLY SAVE THE WORLD. I'M SURE YOU KNOW BEN FRANKLIN'S SAYING, AN OUNCE OF PREVENTION IS WORTH A POUND OF CURE. TH TRUTH I OBVIOUS, AND YET SO HARD TO CARRY OUT IN REALITY. WE FAIL TO HEED THIS TRUTH. THE EDENVILLE DAM, THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC, CONTINUED INJUSTICE TOWARDS BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE AND THE LIST GOES ON AND PERHAPS THE BIGGEST EXAMPLE IS THE CLIMATE CRISIS. YES, ACTING ON A2ZERO MAY SEEM EXNSIVE NOW B THE CONSEQUENCES OF NOT ACTING ARE SO MUCH WORSE. THE TIME IS NOW TO HAVE THE COURAGE TO ACT PROACTIVELY, TO JOYFULLY TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY AND ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF CLIMATE CHANGE BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE. THIS IS ANN ARBOR'S TIME TO BE A BEACON NOT JUST OF HOPE, BUT OF ACTION. ANN ARBOR'S TIME TO BE A SOURCE OF RESTORATION, SECITY, AND COMPETENCE. YOUR VOTE IS THE KEY. PLEASE TAKE THE TIME TO LEAVE A LASTING POSITIVE LEGACY, NOT ONLY FOR OURSELVES BUT FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS TO COME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

DEVELOPING ENERGY EFFICIENT AFFORDABLE HOUSING AS CALLED FOR IN THE PLAN, ADDRESSES IMMEDIATE NEEDS WHILE LOOKING TOWARDS FUTURE. THE SAVINGS OF CRUDE FROM NET ZERO ENERGY HOUSING MAK REACHINGHE CITY'S FORDABILITYOALS MORE ACHIEVABLE. MOREOVER, THIS PANDEMIC HAS DEMONSTRATED THE NEED FOR COMMUNITY-BASED PROGRAMS WHICH AIDS THE LESS FORTUNATE DURING THESE TIMES OF DISASTER. MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITIES NEED TO BE ABLE TO CONNECT AND SUPPORT ONE ANOTHER WHILE SOCIAL DISTANCING AND AS WE RECOVER FROM THE EFFECTS OF SOCIAL DISTANCING. VESTING IN RESILNCE HUBS WHH ARE INCLUDED IN T A2ZERO PLAN, REDUCES GREEN HOUSE GASES AND PREPARES US FOR THE INEVITABLE NATURAL DISASTER. THE CITY STAFF HAS INCLUDED FOR EVERY $1 INVESTED IN RESILIENCE, $7 ARE SAVED. THE STUDENT ADVISORY COUNCIL ASKED THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR TO PASS THE CARBON NEUTRALITY PLAN NOT DESPITE THE PLAN BUT IN LIGHT OF THE DEVASTATING EFFECTS. NOW IT'S TIME TO REFLECT ON HOW IT'S RESPONDING TO THE CURRENT CRISIS SO THAT WE ARE PREPARED FOR TOMORROW. NO TO REACH CARBON NEUTRALITY, WE ALSO NEED TO HOLD ALL STAKEHOLDERS ACCOUNTABLE AND HAVE THEM WORK TOGETHER IN TANDEM. THE UNIVERSI OF MHIGAN CENTRA STUDENT GOVNMENT RECENTLY PASSED A RESOLUTION CALLING FOR THE ADMINISTRATION TO INVEST IN MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT STREETLIGHTS. AS A PARTNER ASSOCIATED WITH CENTRAL GOVERNMENT, THE STUDENT ADVISORY COUNCIL ASK THAT THE CITY ALSO INVEST THE RESOURCES INTO STREETLIGHT AND TRAFFIC SIGNAL ENERGY EFFICIENCY, BY TRANSITIONING TO LEDs. THESE ARE A FEW OF THE EXTREMELY NECESSARY POIN WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN THE PLAN.

02:16:53.624: >> HI, MY NAME IS BECCA HARLEY. I'M SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF THE A2ZERO CARBON NEUTRALITY PLAN. SPECIFICALLY, I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE CONCERNING ARGUMENT THAT THE CITY SHOULD WAIT AROUND TO SEE WHAT U OF M DOES WITH CARBON NEUTRALITY PLAN BEFORE IT DECIDES TO TAKE DECISIVE ACTION. AND STUDENTT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, I HAVE FOLLOWED U OF M'S PATH TOWARDS CARBON NEUTRALITY THROUGH THE PRESIDENT'S COMMISSION ON CARBON NEUTRALITY OR PCCM. THE FACT THAT WE HAVE BEEN DISAPPOINTED THAT THE PCCM THUS FAR, THE PROCESS HAS BEEN OPAQUE. THEY FAILED TO SET A TARGET DATE. THEY HAVE PRIORITIZED THE ISSUES OF DTE CONSUMERS AND DTE NSUMER ENERGY OVER FRONT LINE CONSUMERS AND PARTICULARLY RELEVANT THEY HAVE ARTICULATED THE EXACT SAME ARGUMENT. WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING BOLD OR DECISIVE UNTIL WE KNOW WHAT THE CITY DOES. THE TWO MOST POWERFUL GOVERNING BODIES IN THE CITY PASS THE BUCK TO EACH OTHER. WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING IF THEY DOT DO ANYTHING. THIS DYNAMIC HAS DOMINATED GOVERNING BODIES ACROSS THE GLOBE. WE HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THEY ACT FIRST. GUESS WHAT THE FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRY RELIES ON THE STALEMATES AND IT'S OUR IMPERATIVE TO BREAK THEM. THE BOTTOM LINE HERE IS YOU HAVE TO LEAD. CITY COUNCIL HAS LED BEFORE, WRITTEN, SETTING A HARD DATE FOR CARBON NEUTRALITY. WE'RE CALLING ON YOU NOW TO STEP UP ONCE AGAIN, SET THE TONE AND DEMONSTRATE THAT YOU ARE SERIOUS ABOUT THIS AND THEY SHOULD BE TRUE. THE CITY HAS TREMENDOUS INFLUENCE. IF YOU TURN THIS CLAIM DOWN, YOU ARE SIGNALING TO THE UNIVERSITY THAT YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT CARBON NEUTRALITY AND THEY WILL ACT DOING SOOULD N ONLY THREATE CARBON NEUALITY EFFORTS AT THE CITY LEVEL BUT PUT U OF M'S EFFORTS IN JEOPARDY AS WELL. U OF M'S CARBON NEUTRALITY EFFORTS WITH ALL OF THE PITFALLS HAVE DEMONSTRATED THEY ARE NOT A RELIABLE LEADER AND THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR NEEDS TO BE FOREFRONT WHEN IT COMES TO CARBON NEUTRALITY. THE A2ZERO CARBON NEUTRALITY PLAN SHOWS THE LEADERSHI THAT IS LACKI IN U OF M'S PLAN. BY PASSING THIS PLAN, ANN ARBOR CAN BECOME THE TRAILBLAZER THAT IT NEEDS TO BE AND THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN WILL FOLLOW ITS EXAMPLE. I ALSO WOULD JUST LIKE TO ADD MY SUPPORT TO ZANAB'S EARLIER COMMENTS ABOUT THE CENTERING THE ANN ARBOR CARBON NEUTRALITY PLAN AROUND EQUITY. SOEAH. THAT'S MY COMNT. THANK YOU.
02:19:24.708: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

02:19:36.920: >> HI, I'M IAN. I'M A WARD 5 RESIDENT OF THE ANN ARBOR AND I'M ALSO THE COCHAIR OF THE ECO SOCIAL COMMITTEE OF THE HURON VALLEY DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISTS OF AMERICA. I WANTED TO ECHO WHAT SOME OTHER YOUTH CALLERS HAVE STATED ABOUT EQUITY BEING A CENTRAL PART OF THIS PLAN AND I WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT THE FACT THAT DTE OPPOSES COMMUNITY CHOIC AGGREGION, IN MY OPINION IS A HUGE ENDORSEMENT FOR THAT PART OF THE PLAN. I WANT TO THANK CITY COUNCIL FOR THE LEADERSHIP IN DECLARING THE CLIMATE ENERGY, AND SETTING THE GOAL OF 2030 FOR CARBON NEUTRALITY. WE UNDERSTAND THAT COMBATTING THE CLIMATE CRISIS IS A LONG-TERM BATTLE AND IT WILL BE EXPENSIVE. GETTING US TO CARBON NEUTRALITY NEEDS TO HAPPE AS ON AS POSSLE. IT NDED TO HAPN T YEARS AGO AND IT STILL NEEDS TO HAPPEN DURING A PANDEMIC. ALL OF YOU VOTED FOR THE CARBON NEUTRALITY GOAL AND I KNOW ALL OF YOU WANT TO APPROVE A PLAN THAT CAN HELP US RESPOND TO THIS EMERGENCY. THE PLAN BEFORE YOU IS A2ZERO IS AN OBJECTIVELY IMPRESSIVE PLAN. I HAVE MY ISSUES WITH IT, BUT I KNOW WE CAN ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES AFTE APPROVING THE PLAN AS IT IS CURRENTLY PROPOSED. DECLARING THE MA EMERGENCY WAS E EASIEST PART OF THE PRO E SEES. THIS IS THE NOT THE HARDEST STEP IN THE PROCESS BUT IT'S THE NECESSARY STEP. AND IN CLOSING, I WANTED TO COMMENT ON A STATEMENT MADE DURING THE PUBLIC HEARING AT THE START OF THE MEETING. EVANEDMOND ASKEDOU T COMMIT TOO FUNDING FOR THE POLICE DEPARTMENT. I SEE MORE SUSTAINABLE AFFORDABLE HOUSING, CHEAPER, CLEANER ENERGY, FEWER CARS CLOGGING THE HIGHWAYS, AND MORE RESILIENT COMMUNITIES. I SEE A FUTURE WITHOUT THE POLICE. I ASK YOU ALL TO TAKE SE TIM TO SERIOLY ENGE WITH THE IDEA OF AN END OF POLICING AND THE END OF THE HOSTILE OCCUPATION OF THE BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITY. IN ANN ARBOR, ONE OF THE MOST ECONOMICALLY SEGREGATED. THINK OF ALL THE GOOD THAT $29 MILLION, THOSE RESOURCES AND THOSE PEOPLE IN THAT DEPARTMENT COULD DO FOR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS OUTSIDE OF THE EXISTING VENTURES. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

02:22:05.836: >> HI. MY NAME IS CARNALIA AND I'M A RESIDENT OF WARD 3. THE A2ZO PN.VOICE MY SUPRTOR I THINK IT'S A COMPREHENSIVE AND FLEXIBLE PATH FOR ANN ARBOR TO REACH CARBON NEUTRALITY. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE PLAN PROPOSES A WIDE VARIETY OF MEASURES AND THEN GIVES, CITY COUNCIL AND ITS ADMINISTRATORS THE FLEXIBILITY TO DECID ON H TO PRIORITIZ THEM. I THINK IT SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT APPROACH TO ME, AND, YOU KNOW, IF ANY OF YOU HAVE DOUBTS ABOUT SPECIFIC INDIVIDUAL MEASURES, I DON'T THINK IT SHOULD BE -- I DON'T THINK IT'S A GOOD REASON TO OVERSIDE YOUR GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH THE OBJECTIVES. YOU KNOW, WITH THE COV CRISIS, WE SEE HOW IGNORING EARLY WARNINGS CAUSED LIVES TO BE LOST. I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD KEEP MAKING THIS MISTAKE, WITH THE CLIMATE CRISIS, IT'S LIKELY TO BE EVEN MORE DEVASTATING IN THE LONGER TERM. SO, YEAH, I JUST HOPE, YOU KNOW, ANN ARBOR TAKES THE LEAD IN TACKLING THIS CRISIS, AND SWS HER CITIES T WAY FORWARD. PLEASE VOTE YES ON THIS PLAN. THANKS.

02:23:38.929: >> MY NAME IS MATT, I'M A UDENT ORGIZER LIVG IN WARD 5 AND I'M HERE TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF THE CARBON NEUTRALITY. MOST OF THE SPEECHES HAVE BEEN FRIENDLY. I'M NOT HERE TO BE FRIENDLY. ANN ARBOR PUTS ON HEIRS AS A PROGRESSIVE SIGN. YOU BELONG HERE ADORNS THE SIGNS OF MILLION DOLLARS HOMES AND BUSINESSES PAY THEIR EMPLOYE HALF THE LIVIN WAGE. THEY WILL REFUSE TO HOLD COPS ACCOUNTABLE FOR MURDER. I LIVED HERE FOR SEVEN YEARS FOR UNDERGRAD AND NOW MASTER'S IN ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY. BY NOW I KNOW BETTER. YOUR CLAIMS THAT YOU CARE ABOUT THE CLIMATE CRISIS WHEN THEY ARE NOT PAIRED WITH ACTION ARE EMPTY RHETORIC. WE ARE SICK OF HEARING THAT YOUNG RADICAL AIVISTS PNT YOU AS CLIMATE DENIERS. YOU BELIEVE THE SCIENCE BUT DON'T THINK THE SOLUTIONS ARE FEASIBLE. I WILL NOT CALL YOU A CLIMATE DENIER, BUT WHAT I WILL SAY, IN 2020, THAT DISTINCTION IS MEANINGLESS. THE ARGUMENTS THAT YOU PUT IN OPPOSITION TO THE PLAN ARE IN TERRIBLE FAITH. ONE THAT WE KEEP HEARING IS MANY OF THE ACTIONS CANNOT HAPPEN UNTI STATE LAW CHANGES RENDERINTHEMOINTLESSO PURSUE. I'M CURIOUS HOW ON EARTH ANYONE EXPECTS CARBON NEUTRALITY TO BE ACHIEVABLE WITHIN THE IMPOSSIBLY RESTRICTED CURRENT STATE LAWS WHICH, FOR EXAMPLE, LIMITED DISTRIBUTED ENERGY GENERATION TO 1% OF THE STATE'S TOTAL ENERGY PRODUCTION. WE NEED TO BE PART OF THE CHANGE IN STATE LAW. WE ALSO KEEP HEARING THAT THIS PLAN IS JUST AN EXCUSE TO INCREASE HOUSING DENTY, WCH WILL RUINEIGHBORHOOD CHARACTER. EVERYONE ARGUING THIS IS AN ABJECT DENIAL THAT THE PRECIOUS NEIGHBORHOOD CHARACTER IS A PRODUCT OF A SYSTEM THAT HAS MADE THEIR LIVES VERY EASY, AND THE LIVES OF OPPRESSED PEOPLE RIGHT HERE AND ACROSS THE WORLD ABSOLUTELY MISERABLE. SO, NO, I DON'T GIVE A RAT'S ASS ABOUT NEIBORHOOD CHARACTER BUHUMAN BEINGS WHE PEOPL CAN AFFORD HOUSING AND DRASTIC ACTION TO AVERT A CLIMATE CATASTROPHE. BUT THESE TYPES OF ARGUMENTS ARE PART AND PARCEL. THE WHITE, RICH, LIBERAL ANN ARBOR ETHOS. THEY HAVE BEEN RIDING ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION 50 YEARS AGO, CLAIMING IT'S S STILL A BASTION OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROPERTY. WHEN YOU HOLD THE PROPERTY AND WEALTH THAT PROPERTY OWNERS YOUR ALLYSHIP AND BELIEVING IN SCIENCE HOLD NO WATER UNLESS YOU ARE ALL ALSO WILLING TO MAKE MATERIAL SACRIFICES. CLERK 30 SECONDS.

AND THE HONOR TO SPEAK TO YOU, BUT I'M ALSO GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE SPEAKING WITH YOU ALL IN PARTICULAR, ABOUT THE THREAT OF CLIMATE CHANGE WHICH EVEN GIVEN ALL THE CHALLENGES WE FACE IN THE WORLD RIGHT NOW IS AN EXY TENTIAL CRISIS THAT CERTAINS ME OEHALFF ALL HUMAN CRISIS. IF MORE GOVERNMENTS OF ALL LEVELS DON'T BEGIN TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY, I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR PASSING YOUR CLIMATE EMERGENCY, AND CARBON NEUTRALITY RESOLUTION, AND SUSTAINABILITY OFFICE, AND FOR WHAT THAT MEANT AS A DEMONSTRATION TO THE CITY AND THE RESIDENTS OF LEADERSHIP AND THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE URGENCY AND THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS CHAENGE. LASTEAR IAS SELECTEDO SERVE AS ONE 16 MEMBERS ON THE COMMISSION OF CARBON NEUTRALITY, CHARTING THE PATH FORWARD AND I SERVED WITH MANY OF MY NEIGHBORS AND STAKEHOLDERS ON THE ENERGY TECHNICAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE, ON THIS PLAN'S DEVELOPMENT. ALONGSIDE MISSY, I'M THE HIGHEST RANKING MEMBER TO SERVE IN THE A2ZERO EFFORT. I BELIEVE AT 23EARS OLD I'M THE YOUNGEST PERSON BY FAR TO SERVE IN BOTH OF THOSE EFFORTS. I HAVE DONE MY BEST IN THIS WORK AS YOU ALL DO TOO, I KNOW TO REPRESENT AS BEST AS I CAN WITHIN THE LIMITATIONS OF MY IDENTITIES AND MY EXPERIENCE, THE FUTURE OF THIS CITY, THE MEMBERS OF MY GENERATION, AND THOSE IN GENERATIONS YOUNGER AND YET TO BE.

IT'S NOT LOST ON ME THAT THE PLAN BEFORE YOU DOESN'T KNOW EVERY DETAIL AND THAT INCLUDES A FEW REFERENCES AND SUGGESTIONS TO LAND USE, THAT MANY OF YOU ARE RIGHTLY ATTENTIVE TO. THESE ARE LEGITIMATE CONCERNS FOR THE CHIEF LAW MAKING BODY AS THEY BEAR ON THE FABRIC OF THE CITY. AS I SEE IT,HAT TYP AND LEVEL OF DECISION IS NOT WHAT SITS BEFORE YOU TODAY.

I BELIEVE ALL OF YOU ALSO THINK IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO BECAUSE OF YOUR UNANIMOUS RESOLUTION DECLARING A CLIMATE EMERGENCY AND SETTING A GOAL OF CARBON NEUTRALITY B030. E A2ZER PLAN HAS SEVEN OVERARCHING GOALS AND IF WE ARE TO ACHIEVE CARBON NEUTRALITY, THERE ISN'T REALLY ANY WAY AROUND THOSE SEVEN ITEMS. THE INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE SEVEN GOALS WILL CHANGE AS WE PROGRESS AND YOU STILL HAVE A SAY OVER EVERY STEP THE WAY. THI A2ZERO IS THE PLAN THAT YOU ASKED FOR, AND I'M HOPEFUL THAT YOU WILL ADOPT IT. THANK YOU.

02:31:41.077: >> GOOD EVENING, ITEVEN BROWN RESIDING IN WARD 3. I WANT TO EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE FOR BEGINNING TO ADDRESS THE CLIMATE EMERGENCY. THIS IS A MAJOR EXISTENTIAL THREAT TO OUR CIVILIZATION THAT IS CLEAR BUT NOT AS PRESENT AS THE CURRENT PANDEMIC. IT'S DIFFICULT TO PERCEIVE GREEN HOUSE GASES AS A PRESENT DANGER AND EASYOEL EN MINOR REMEDIES. WE HAVE JUST ENOUGH TIME TO SLOW THIS RUNAWAY TRAIN TO PRESERVE A LITTLE BIT OF A WORLD FOR OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN. SOME CLAIM THAT THIS IS AN ALL OR NOTHING PLAN. THIS IS A CAREFULLY RESEARCHED ROADMAP INDICATING WHERE THE PROBLEMS EXIST AND IDENTIFY SOLUTIONS WITH THE COST ESTIMATES. INDEED THERE ARE INTERDEPENDENCS BUT THE'S THING IN IT THAT SAYS TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT. THIS PLAN IS A LIVING DOCUMENT. ACTIONS WILL CHANGE OVER TIME, BASED ON COMMUNITY FEEDBACK, LESSONS LEARNED, NEW BEST PRACTICES AND TECHNOLOGIES. A PROPOSAL HAS BEEN PROVIDED DESCRIBING HOW THE PLAN WILL BE DONE. MOREOVER, EVERY ACTION HAS AN INDICATOR OF SUCCESS. OTHERS HAVE SAT ON SOCIAEDIA THAT ANN AOR SHOULD WT FOR E UNIVERSITY OF MICHIG TO ACT. SINCE THE CITY'S EMISSIONS ARE TWICE U OF M'S, THE CITY SHOULD BE AMONG THE LEADERS IN THE BEST AND CAN WORK IN HAND WITH THE UNIVERSITY'S BOTH INSTITUTIONS TO DECLARE A CLIMATE EMERGENCY AND WILL BE PREPARED TO COORDINATE GOING FORWARD AS PARTNERS IN THE SAME COMMUNITY. THE TIMELINES GIVEN FOR A2ZER ENABNG STATE LEGLATION HAVE ALSO BEEN ATTACKED AS TOO SHORT. IN FACT, TWO PACKAGES OF BILLS WERE INTRODUCED LAST YEAR BY REPRESENTATIVE ROB IAN AND SENATOR IRWIN, WHICH WERE WRITTEN TO APPEAL TO LIBERTARIAN REPUBLICANS. THESE ARE ALLIES IN OUR STRUGGLE. THE THIRD BILL ALLOWS SIX YEARS FOR PASSAGE WITH A VIABLE BACKUP OPTION IF LEGLATION FLS. BBYING ISRGANIZED STATEWIDE, INCLUDING LIKE-MINDED COMMUNITIES LIKE GRAND RAPIDS, TRAVIS AND MORE. MOST OF THE FUNDING COMES FROM THIRD PARTIES NOT UNDER THE CITY'S CONTROL. LIKE ANY LONG-TERM INVESTMENT PLAN, AND MOST OF THE CITY'S CAPITAL PROJECTS, A2ZERO INCLUDES INITIATIVES TO LEVAGE MULTLE FUNNG SOUES. HOW IS THIS A DIFFERENT PRACTICE FOR SUCH A MAJOR PROJECT? PLEASE APPROVE THE CURRENT A2ZERO ROADMAP AS A REASONABLE GENERAL GUIDE AND LET'S ALL GET TO WORK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, COUNCIL, AND MAYOR.
02:34:11.594: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
02:34:17.033: >> Clerk Beaudry: NEXT UP IS CALLER 653. CALLER 653, GO AHEAD.
02:34:22.272: >> HELLO. MY NAME IS CHRIS AND I'M THE Ph.D. STUDENT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN. AND I'M HERE TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF THE CARBON NEUTRALITY PLAN IN. PARTICULAR, I WANTED TO ADDRESS A FEW OF THE KEY ARGUMENTS AGAINST THE PLAN THAT I HAVE HEARD IN THE PAST FEW WKS. AND DEMONSTRATE THE SERIOUSNESS. THE FIRST ARGUMENT IS THAT THE PLAN IS IMPERFECT AND THAT INSTEAD OF IMPROVING AN IMPERFECT PLAN, WE SHOULD COME UP WITH THE RIGHT PLAN. IF WE WAIT FOR AN IDEALIST PERFECT PLAN, WE WILL NEVER ACT. WE DO NOT KNOW EVERYTHING. WE CANNOT KNOW EVERYTHING. AND THIS PLAN IS INCREDIBLY USEFUL FRAMEWORK TO MOVE FORWARD STRATEGICALLY. WE HAVE HIRED EREMELY INTELLIGENT AND QUALIFIED PEOPLE TO DEVELOP THESE RECOMMENDATIONS AFTER EXTENSIVE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT. DESIGNING THESE RECOMMENDATIONS IS NO DIFFERENT FROM DENYING THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF EXPERTS SIMPLY BECAUSE WE DO NOT LIKE WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY. THE LONGER WE WAIT, THE MORE DRASTIC THE CHANGES REQUIRED, AND THE MORE THE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE GOING TO STING. THE SECOND ARGUMEN IHAT TS AN CALLS TORE ZONINGHANGES THAT WILL CHANGE ANN ARBOR NEIGHBORHOODS TOO DRASTICALLY, THE SCIENCE COULD NOT BE MORE CLEAR. HIGHER DENSITY AND MIXED USE NEIGHBORHOODS ARE ESSENTIAL FOR REDUCING CARBON EMISSIONS OF URBAN LIVING. AS MUCH AS WE MAY LIKE OUR NEIGHBORHOOD EXACTLY AS THEY ARE, THE FACT IS THAT WE HAVE NO CHOICE. IF WE WANT A LIVABLE FUTURE, THINGS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO CHANGE. THE CURRENT PN STRIKES A GOOD BALANCE, BUT ADJUSTING ZONING CHANGES THAT ALLOW FOR QUADPLEXES AND KEEPING THE SCALE OF DEVELOPMENT SMALL AND THE NEIGHBORHOOD CHARACTER INTACT. PEOPLE HAVE A LEGITIMATE CONCERN ABOUT THE POTENTIAL AFFORDABLE OF SUCH UNITS AND THIS IS AN IMPORTANT POINT. ANN ARBOR URGENTLY NEEDS T AND ADDRESS THE EXTREME COST OF LIVING HERE. BUT THIS GOAL IS NOT COUNTER TO THE GOAL OF PLANS, IN FACT THEY GO HAND IN HAND. CLIMATE RESILIENCE DEMANDS ADDRESSING ISSUES OF EQUITY. FINALLY, ARGUMENT THREE, THAT THE PLAN RELIES ON U OF M AND OTHER EXTERNAL ACTORS TOO MUCH. THE FACT IS THAT WE CANNOT CONTROL WHAT U OF MOES AND WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGEHAT THEY ARE A MAJOR PLAYER. FOR ANN ARBOR AS A WHOLE TO REACH CARBON NEUTRALITY, U OF M MUST BE CARBON NEUTRAL AS WELL, BUT IT'S RIDICULOUS TO SAY THAT ACKNOWLEDGING THIS FACT IS A WEAKNESS OF THE PLAN. IT'S JUST THE TRUTH. NO PLAN WRITTEN FOR THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR CAN GUARANTEE A CHANGE IN THE BEHAVIOR OF U OF M OR DTE OR THE STATE LEGLATURE FOR THAT MATTER. WHAT WE CAN DO IS SET THE TONE AND DEMONSTRATE THAT WE ARE DEADLY SERIOUS ABOUT CARBON NEUTRALITY AND USE OUR LEVERAGE TO INFLUENCE THEM TO DO WHAT IS NECESSARY. WE KNEW ALL ALONG THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO BE ON THE LEADING EDGE OF THIS CAUSE. TO SAY IT'S POINTLESS TO TRY BECAUSE OUR REPUBLICAN LEGISLATOR WON'T FALL IN LINE IS ABSURD ANDEFEATIST. ESE ARGUMENTSGAINST CARBON NEUTRALITY ARE WEAK, AND VOTE YES. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR LEADERSHIP IN MAKING ANN ARBOR A SUSTAINABLE, JUST, AND CARBON NEUTRAL COMMUNITY.
02:37:24.454: >> Clerk Beary: CALLER 383. GO AHEAD.
02:37:34.630: >> GOOD EVENING, MEMBERS -- COUNCILMEMBERS AND MAYOR. MY NAME IS RUTH MOORE. I LIVE IN WARD 1, AND I'M I ALONG-TIME RESIDENT OF ANN ARBOR. I WANT TO REINFORCE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE A2ZERO PLAN FOR GETTING US ON THE PATH TO CARBON NEUTRALITY NOW. THE COVIDANDEMIC ANDHE CLATE CRISI ARE BOTH WICKED PROBLEMS. PROBLEMS THAT HAVE A WEB OF COMPLEX INTERDEPENDENCIES AND DIFFICULT TO SOLVE BECAUSE OF INCOMPLETE INFORMATION, AS WELL AS CONTRADICTORY AND CHANGING REQUIREMENTS, WHICH DEFY THE DEVELOPMENT OF EASY, QUICK, SOLUTIONS. WE ARE LIVING NOW IN THE ON PANDEMIC WICKED PROBLEM AND CAN SEE DAILY WHAT HPENS WHEN THERE'S NO THOUGHTFUL PLAN TO GUIDE ACTIONS. THE CARBON NEUTRALITY PLAN PROVIDES A COMMON VISION SO GUIDE THE CREATION AND THE IMPLEMENTATION O OF A JUST TRANSITION OF CARBON NEUTRALITY BY 2030. IT'S A CAREFULLY THOUGHT OUT STRATEGIC PLAN, AND IT'S A LIVING PN THAT ALLOWS FOR ONGOING ASSSMENT AND REASSESSMENT OF ACTIONS TAKEN AND ACTIONS TO BE TAKEN, AS WELL AS THE SITUATION ITSELF. ASSESSMENT, RETHINKING AND ADJUSTMENT IS NECESSARY WITH SUCH A DYNAMIC COMPLEX PROBLEM, FOR INFORMATION WILL BE INCOMPLETE, THINGS WILL CHANGE. AND AIONS TAKENILL AECT WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN NEXT. IN SUCH A CASE, WE NEED A PLAN THAT CAN ACCOMMODATE ON BUILD ON THE FACT THAT THERE WILL BE SEWILL B SERISERENDIPITOUS ITEMS, AND THE WILL BE CONSTRUCTE DISCUSSN ANDNGAGE AUND SATEGIES AND ACTIONS TO BE TAKEN. WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER, AND WE NEED THE A2ZERO PLAN TO KEEP US ALL ALIGNED WITH A COMMON VISION OF CARBON NEUTRALITY AND HOW TO THINK ABOUT GETTING THERE. AND WE NEED THE SUPPORT AND THE LEADERSHIP OF COUNCIL. THIS IS A LARGE SCALE ENDEAVOR TRANSITION TO CBON NEUTRALITY. ONLY GOVERNMENT CAN LEAD SUCH AN ENDEAVOR. WHILE LIKELY TO BE VERY CHALLENGING, THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS PLAN TO ACHIEVE CARBON NEUTRALITY BY 2030 MAY BE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR HAS EVER DONE.
02:40:02.044: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS

02:40:28.104: >> MY NAME IS SUE HANSON. I LIVE IN WARD 3 ON THE EAST SIDE OF ANN ARBOR. AND I WANT YOU TO APPROVE THE A2ZERO PLAN TONIGHT SO WE CAN GET ON WITH THE VERY DIFFICULT WORK OF IMPLEMENTING IT. I'M BEHIND 100%. YOU MADE THE RIGHT DECISION LAST NOVEMBER WHEN YOU VOTO GET ANN ARBOR TO CARBON NEUTRALITY BY 2030 AND YOU MADE THE RIGHT DECISION WHEN YOU ASKED THE SUSTAINABILITY OFFICE TO DEVELOP A PLAN TO MAKE IT OPEN. THEY DEVELOPED A WELL-RESEARCHED PLAN WITH PLENTY OF INPUT FROM THE COMMUNITY AND THE BUSINESSES. THE PLAN THEY CAME UP WITH IS TOUGH, B I BELVE I WILL GET THE JOB DONE AND WILL DO IT EQUITABLY. EVERY DETAIL IS NOT WORKED OUT, BUT THIS TYPE OF PLAN CANNOT BE PICKED APART AND MICROMANAGED, ESPECIALLY BEFORE EVEN APPROVAL. IT IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. AND I'M INVITING COUNCIL TO SIGN ON TO IT, ANDETNVOLVED IN PLEMENTING IT. YES, YOU SHOULD BRING UP YOUR CONCERNS AND THOSE OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS. BUT DO IT IN A WAY IN WHICH YOU ARE JOINING WITH THE PLAN AND FIGURING OUT HOW TO MAKE THE PLAN WORK. I HAVE HEARD THAT THERE IS OPPOSITION TO INCREASING HOUSING, ANDOUSING DENSITY IN ANN ARBOR. I HEARD THAT PEOPLE THINK THIS WILL CHANGE THE CHARACTER OF ANN ARBOR. I MOVED HERE IN 1980 AND BELIEVE ME, ANN ARBOR HAS CHANGED A GREAT DEAL IN THE TIME I HAVE BEEN HERE AND I KNOW IT WILL AND IT HAS TO KEEP CHANGING. WE DON'T GET A CHOICE AS TO WHETHER IT CHANGES. THE CHANGE IN CLIMATE WILL MAKE THAT A CTAINTY. WE KNOW THAT WE CANNOT GET THE CARBON DOWN UNTIL MORE OF THE PEOPLE WHO WORK IN ANN ARBOR LIVE IN ANN ARBOR. SO THE ONLY WAY TO DO THIS IS BY INCREASING HOUSING IN THE CITY CENTER AND NEIGHBORHOODS. WE DO HAVE A CHOICE IN HOW WE CREATE THAT DENSITY AND WHAT IS -- AND THAT IS WHERE THE CHARACTER OF ANN ARBOR AND THE CHARACTER OF ITS CITIZENS WILL BE MOST UTILIZED. LAST JANUARY WE CALLED A MEETING ABOUT THE CLIMATE EMERGENCY IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD, AND INVITED MISSY STULTS TO PRESENT WHAT LOCAL AA FROM CHANGINGT INUR CLIMATE. WE HAD OVER 100 PEOPLE ATTENDED THIS MEETING. THEY ASKED QUESTIONS. THEY ARE READY TO TAKE ACTION. THEY ARE READY TO WORK ON THIS. I HOPE THAT YOU WILL ALSO. THANK YOU.

IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO IGNORE THE CONTEXT OF THE MOMENT AND YOUR ACTIONS TODAY. 100-YEAR PANDEMIC, A DEEP ECONOMIC CRISIS, SYSTEMIC INEQUALITIES THAT MAKE THIS HIT BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES HAER. WE NEEO BEAUTIOUSND WT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS. I WOULD URGE YOU TO CONSIDER THAT THE UNCERTAINTY THAT WE CURRENTLY FACE ACTUALLY UNDERSCORES THE NECESSITY OF BOLD ACTIONS NOW. FOLKS ARE LOOKING FOR ANSWERS ABOUT WHAT WE COULD HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY LAST YEAR, FIVE, TEN, 25 YEARS AGO SO THAT WE COULD HAVE AVOIDED THE CURRENT AND PAIN. CURRENT SUFFERING 2020S THE YEAR THAT OUR KIDS WILL LOOK BACK TO, AND ASK, WHY DIDN'T THEY TAKE PREVENTATIVE ACTION BACK THEN? INACTION NOW WILL HAVE DEVASTATING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS. INTENSIFYING ENVIRONMENTAL CRISIS AND FAILURE TO IMPLEMENT THIS PLAN WILL LEAD TO GREATER ECONOMIC INEQUALITY AND SEGREGATIO YET AGAIN, HITNG OPLE OF COLOR AND POOR NEIGHBORHOODS THE HARDEST. BUT IF IMPLEMENTING, WE WILL HELP ANN ARBOR AND WASHTENAW COUNTY TO CHANGE THE CURRENT PRACTICES THAT HAVE BROUGHT US TO A CRISIS POINT TODAY. SPECIFICALLY ANN ARBOR'S UNDER SUPPLY OF HOUSING MUST BE ADDRESSED. IT'S FORCED TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO WORK IN THE COMMUNITY TO LIVE IN LESS EXPENSIVE AREAS. THE DLY CMUTE OF OVER 80,000 PEOPLE INTO ANN ARBOR FOR WORK IS THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF OUR CARBON EMISSIONS FROM TRANSPORTATION. THE HOUSING SHORTAGE HAS MADE OUR COMMUNITY LESS DIVERSE AND HAS EXACERBATED INEQUALITY. THE CARBON NEUTRALITY PLAN WOULD HELP US TO INTEGRATE MULTIPLE UNIT AND ACCESSORY DWELLIN UNITS WHIN AREAS CRENTLY CONCENTRATED WITH SINGLE FAMILY HOUSING. IF EQUITABLE AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING ARE CENTERED. THIS WILL HELP US REVERSE THE CRISIS IN ANN ARBOR. THIS IS A CRISIS THAT WILL LEAD US BACK TO THE SPIRALING INEQUITIES AND ULTIMATELY IN AN UNSUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY BUT THIS PLAN MAK ITORE PSIBLE TO BUILD WHERE PEOPLE OF ALL INCOME INCOMES CAN LIVE TO GO AND WE LEARN ACROSS ECONOMIC RACIAL AND CULTURAL DIFFERENCES AND BEGIN TO BREAK DOWN THE CULTURE OF INEQUALITY AND WE BEGIN OUR PATH FORWARD TO A HEALTHIER COMMUNITY. PLEASE ACT SO THAT OUR LEGACY TO OUR CHILDREN IS ONE THAT WE ARE PRD OF,NOWING TT WE DID EVERYTHI THAT WE COULD TO LEAVE THEM WITH A HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT AND SUSTAINABLE, RESILIENT AND EQUITABLE COMMUNITY. PLEASE VOTE YES TO APPROVE THE CITY'S LIVING CARBON NEUTRALITY PLAN. AND THANK YOU FOR FUNDING THE CITY'S CLIMATE WORK IN THE UPCOMING BUDGET. GOOD NIGHT.

I WANTED TO TAL ABOUT A FEW OF THE POINTS THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP. ONE OF THE POINTS THAT HAS BEEN SORT OF A STICKING POINT, IT SEEMS IS NON-MOTORIZED TRANSIT AND THE PERCEIVED SMALL AMOUNT THAT THAT TAKES. ACTUALLY, FOR YOU TO LOOK AT THE PLAN, ALMOST ALL THE ITEMS ARE WITHIN A FEW PERCENTAGE POINTS, THEY ARE WITHIN 1 TO 7%. THE FACT THAT TRANSPORT IS 2.8, THAT'S SOMEWHERE AROUND THE MEDIUM, RIGHT? SO WE ALWAYS HAVE TO LOOK AT THINGS IN TERMS OF WHERE THEY ARE IN RELATION TO OTHER THINGS IN THE SYSTEM. WE CAN'T, OF COURSE, CALCULATE THE CHANGE IN EMISSIONS OVER TO JS, ET CETERA.VGLOSER I DEMONSTRATED THIS TO COUNCIL IN THE PAPER I WROTE FOR YOU IN NOVEMBER, US ISING SEMCOG DATA, WE CAN SEE WHEN PEOPLE MOVE HOW THEIR TRAFFIC PATTERNS CHANGE. WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT EMBODIED CARBON CALCULATIONS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE PLAN TALKS ALSO ABOUT UPSTREAM AND DNSTREAM EFFEC. AN THATS ALSO SOMETHING THAT WE CAN CALCULATE. A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO, HE POINTED COUNCIL TO A GROUP THAT PROVIDES TOOLS FOR CALCULATING THAT CAN BE CALCULATED ON A PER PROJECT BASIS, ET CETERA. SO VOTING FOR THIS TONIGHT DOESN'T PREVENT YOU FRO DEALING WITH THE NOTION OF EMBODIED CARBON. EVEN IF WE SAY THAT CON CONCRETS HIGH EMBODIED CARBON. IN RELATION TO THE TOTAL AMOUNT IN ALL OF THESE LITTLE PIECES. THE OTHER THING I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT IS -- YOU KNOW, WE TALK ABOUT LAND USE, AND I'M GOING TO GET A LITTLE PERSONAL F A SECOND HERE.
02:49:11.059: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
02:49:12.027: >> I LIVE IN A DUPLEX AND HAVE DONE SO WITH MY WIFE, WHO IS GOING ON 30 WEEKS OF PREGNANT. IT'S BEEN VERY IMPORTANT TO US TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A DUPLEX IN THE COMMUNITY. AND HOUSING THAT'S DISTRIBUTED IN THAT NATURE, HAS A LOT OF ENVIRONMENTAL VUES. IS DOESN'TREVENT Y OF PARTICIPATING IN THE PROCESS OF ALL OF THESE INDIVIDUAL THINGS MOVING FORWARD. I ENCOURAGE YOU TO VOTE FOR THIS AND TO DEMONSTRATE LEADERSHIP AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR DEMONSTRATING THAT LEADERSHIP TONIGHT. THANK YOU.
02:49:49.364: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
02:49:52.201: >>lerk BeaudryCALLER 231,O AHEAD.
02:49:54.102: >> YES. THIS IS CHUCK LOUST IN WARD ONE. I'M NOT REPRESENTING ANY ORGANIZATION. I'M JUST SOMEBODY WHO LIVES IN THE CITY. I HAVE LIVED IN MY RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD NOW FOR OVER 20 YEARS. AND I HAVE -- I'M TRYING TO WRAP MY HEAD AROUND THIS PLAN. THERE ARE PARTS THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND AND I HAVE TO BE QUITE FNK. THIS PLAN, IT'S A VERY LARGE AND COMPLICATED PLAN ANOMIA LITTLE BIT A -- AND I'M A LITTLE BIT APPALLED THAT THIS COUNCIL IS FORCED TO ACCEPT OR DENY THE PLAN, IN AN UP OR DOWN VOTE. THERE'S SO MANY ELEMENTS OF THE PLAN THAT ARE BROKEN OUT AND IT COULD BE VOTED ON SEPARATELY AND I THINK IT SHOULD BE. I THINK THE APPROACH THAT THE COUNCIL TOOK, IN TER O RECEING THE PLA WAS GOO WAY FOR N, AND, YOU KNOW, I THINK -- LIKE I SAID, I REALLY APPLAUD THE LEADERSHIP, BUT I THINK THIS PLAN HAS A NUMBER OF ISSUES WITH IT, IN PARTICULAR, THE LAND USE PROPOSAL, ALL THAT THEY ARE SAYING, FOR EXAMPLE, IS THAT WE WILL ALLOW BUY RIGHT QUAD PLEXES. I THINK THE BETTER WAYS IF YOU WANT TO ACHIEVE DENSITY, THAN DOINGT THAT WAY, BUT YET THAT WOULD BASICALLY ALTER THE MASTER PLAN AND SO THERE ARE IMPLICATIONS THAT, YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK HAVE BEEN FULLY THOUGHT THROUGH. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT HAVE BO BROAD SUPPORT AND T SHOULD BE ADOPTED IMMEDIATELY. I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THIS WAS AN ALL UP OR DOWN. YOU KNOW, IT'S -- ITIND OF -- IT SMACKS OF MANIPULATION HERE THATTITHAT, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE SN THIS BEFORE. THAT CRISIS COMES AND THE GOVERNMENTS PREPARE PLANS IN THE BACK ROOM AND THEY WAIT FOR A CRISIS TO HAPPEN AND THEN THEY TELL THE REPRESENTATIVES THEY HAVE TO VOTE ON IT UP OR DOWN. YOU KNOW, THERE'S NO TIME TO EVEN READ THE THING. YOU KN, WE CANNOT REPEAT THIS. AEE, YOU KNOW, JUST WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO TAKE OUR TIME AND DEBATE THIS ISSUE AND, YOU KNOW, THAT'S REALLY ALL I HAVE TO SAY FOR NOW. HAVE A NICE NIGHT. AND I APPLAUD YOUR ACTION ON THIS MATTER. THANKS.
02:51:58.260: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
02:52:02.831: >> Clerkeaudry: NEXT U IS CALLER 958. CALLER 958, GO AHEAD.
02:52:08.236: >> HI, MY NAME IS KATHERINE STARR. I'M A RESIDENT OF ANN ARBOR WARD 3. I'M CALLING TONIGHT TO EX E PRESS MY SUPPORT FOR THE ■A2ZERO PLAN. I WANTED TO FIRST EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE FOR THE WORK THAT COUNCIL AND A2ZERO HAS DONE TO GET OUR COMNITY TOHIS POINT, ERE WE AREONSIDERING A LIFE CHANGING STEP FORWARD AND A CARBON NEUTRALITY PLAN BY 2030. I HAVE EXPERIENCED MANY MOMENTS OF FRUSTRATION AND DESPAIR ABOUT THE STATE OF OUR WORLD AND OUR ENVIRONMENT OVER THE LAST DECADE. AND I DO NOT KNOW -- I DO KNOW THAT I HAVE NEVER FELT AS HOPEFUL, INSPIRED AND DEDICATED TO SUPPORT CHANG AS DID WHEN I READHE A2ZERO PLAN. MY STAKE IN THE FUTURE IS PRICELESS, AND NOT SIMPLY MY OWN. I'M A SOCIAL WORKER, EDUCATED AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN. I OWN A CHILD AND FAMILY THERAPY PRACTICE AND I WORK WITH CHILDREN IN THE COMMUNITY WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED TRAUMA. THE WORK I DO REQUIRES A PRIMARY FOCUS ON SAFETY, TO PROMOTE HEING, TRAFORMATION,ND GROWTH. SAFETY MEANS SAFETY IN RELATIONSHIPS AND COMMUNITY AND IN ENVIRONMENT TO HELP CHILDREN EXPERIENCE A SENSE OF SAFETY IN THEIR BODIES. THAT ALLOWS US TO BE OUR TRUE CONNECTEDSELVES. CONNECTED TO OUR OWN BODIES AND SPIRITS AND CONNECTED TO OTHERS IN OUR LIVES AND CONNECTED TO OUR EARTH. BECAUSE YOU DECRED A CLITE EMERGENCY LAST YEAR, I KW YOU ARE AWARE OF THE TREMENDOUS THREAT THAT CLIMATE CRISIS POSES TO ALL OF OUR SAFETY AND PARTICULARLY TO THOSE WHO ARE ALREADY THE MOST VULNERABLE. SOCIAL JUSTICE, RACIAL JUSTICE, ECONOMIC JUSTICE, AND CLIMATE JUSTICE ACKNOWLEDGE OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO CREATE A SAFER WORLD. YOU DO NOT GET TO SEE FIRSTHAND THE BEAUTIFUL AND THE POWERFUL HEALING AND GWTH T YOU OPLE WHOEDICATE THEMSELVES TO THERAPY IN THE ENVIRONMENT EVERY DAY. I'M INCREDIBLY PRIVILEGED AND HONOR TO WITNESS THE HEART, SPIRITS AND VOICES OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE IN THIS COMMUNITY. ANYONE ELSE WHO IS RAISING A CHILD RIGHT NOW, WOULD WORKS WITH CHILDREN AND WHO HAS EXPERIENCED YOUR OWN GROWTH IN HEALING KNOWS THAT THE POTENTIAL IN EACH INDIVIDUALIFE I BEYONDHAT WE CAN EVENRYO MEASURE WITH THE DOLLARS. YOUNG PEOPLE MOVE ME, INSPIRE ME AND CHALLENGE ME CONSTANTLY. I SEE THEM DO T HARDEST KIND OF WORK IN THERAPY EVERY DAY. PART OF WHAT HELPS THEM DO THIS WORK IS THE FACT THAT THEY SEE THAT I'M STEADY AND PRESENT WITH THEM AND THEIR PAIN TO END DISCOMFORT. THEY ARE NOT ALONE IN THE PROCESS.
02:54:37.719: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECON.
02:54:38.620: >> WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO SHOW UP AND DO THE HARD WORK OUTLINED IN THE A2ZERO PLAN AS WELL. WE NEED TO DO IT NOW. WE MUST DO THE HARDEST WORK NOW SO THAT YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE A PLACE TO REACH THEIR GRANDEST INDIVIDUAL AND COLLECTIVE POTENTIAL. IMAGINE WHAT THE FUTURE WOULD LOOK LIKE IF MORE OF US COULD EXPERIENCE THE SAFET WE KW I POSSIB AND  IMAGINE WHAT A FUTURE WOULD LOOK LIKE IF ALL OF US ARE CONSTANTLY UNDER THREAT. THAT'S WHAT KEEPS ME GOING DAY-TO-DAY, TO INVITE MORE HEALING INTO THIS WORLD. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.
02:55:12.120: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
02:55:16.725: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER 644.
02:55:18.527: >> YES THANK YOU.AD. MY NAME IS KAT BORIS, AND I LIVE IN WARD 5. CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL, BUT A2ZERO IS NOT REAL. INSTEAD THIS HASTILY PREPARED PLAN COULD BE VIEWED AS A PRETEXT, A POLITICAL MANEUVER WHICH WOULD ALLOW THOSE AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF ANN ARBOR GOVERNMENT THROUGH SLIGHT OF LAND TO GIVE A VALUABLE GIFT TO THE DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY. THE SECTION OF A2ZERO THAT BENEFITS THE DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY IS WRITTEN VERY CLEARLY IN PLAIN SIGHT ON PAGE 78 OF THE PLAN. UNDE THE HEADING, REDUCE THE MILES WE TRAVEL IN OUR VEHICLES BY AT LEAST 50%. WE FIND THIS SENTENCE, "THIS ACTION FOCUSES ON ALLOWING MORE HOUSING, UP TO FOUR UNIT RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS AND ACCESSORY DWELLINGNITS B RIGHT IN ALL AREAS OF THE CITY." WHICH MEANS THAT UNLESS YOU HAPPEN TO LIVE IN A DESIGNATED HISTORICAL DISTRICT, THE HOUSE NEXT DOOR TO YOU COULD BE KNOCKED DOWN TO BUILD A DUPLEX, TRIPLEX, OR QUAD PLEX AND THIS WOULD BE ALLOWED UNDER ANN ARBOR' ZING. IF YOU LIV IN ONE OF ANN ARBOR'S MOST EXPENSIVE NEIGHBORHOODS, THIS IS UNLIKELY TO HAPPEN TO YOU BECAUSE DEVELOPERS MAKE THE MOST PROFIT WHEN THEY BUY INEXPENSIVE PROPERTIES FOR THEIR DEVELOPMENT. S. BUT, IF YOU LIVE IN ONE OF THE ANN ARBOR'S LEAST EXPENSIVE NEIGHBORHOODS, THIS IS VERY LIKELY TO HAPPENO Y. AGAIN, BECAUSE DEVELOPERS MAKE THE MOST PROFIT WHEN THEY BUY INEXPENSIVE PROPERTIES FOR THEIR DEVELOPMENTS. IF YOU LIVE IN ONE  OF ANN ARBOR'S LEAST EXPENSIVE NEIGHBORHOODS, YOUR NEIGHBOR WHO DUE ANN AOR'S PROPERT TAXESLY DUE TO T PANDEMIC MAY BE FORCED TO SELL HIS OR HER PROPERTY AND MOVE OUT OF TOWN. LOCAL OR INTERINAUGURATIONAL INL DEVELOPERS WHO CAN OUT BID PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE LOOKING FOR HOMES FOR THEMSELVES WILL BE THE MOST LIKELY BUYERS OF THE PROPERTY.
02:57:50.979: >> 30 SENDS. AT THAT POI THEOST LIKELY SCARIO IS WHAT WE HAVE SEEN OVER AND OVER IN THE CITY, DEVELOPERS BUILD LUXURY UNITS IN ORDER TO MAKE THE GREATEST PROFIT POSSIBLE AND THEREBY PROVIDE US WITH EVEN MORE UNAFFORDABLE HOUSING.
02:58:06.795: >> APPARENTLY THE DISRUPTION WHICH MA MAYOR TAYLOR ASSURES UN PA 5 OF THE2ZERO PN IS REQUIRED TO FIGHT THE CLIMATE EMERGENCY IS NOT TO BE BORNE BY THE WEALTHIEST OF ANN ARBOR'S CITIZENS BUT THOSE WHO LIVE IN THE LEAST EXPENSIVE NEIGHBORHOODS AND ARE LEAST ABLE TO BEAR THAT DISRUPTION. THOSE FOR WHOM IT MIGHT BE A LUXURY TO GIVE MUCH THOUGHT TO GLOBAL WARMING.
02:58:35.123: >> Crk Beaudry: THK YOU.

MOSTF MY COLLEAGUES LIVE IN YPSILANTI, AND DEXTER, NORTHVILLE AND OTHER SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES BECAUSE ANN ARBOR HAS BECOME UNAFFORDABLE FOLLOW THE TEACHERS THAT WORK HERE. I STRONGLY URGE YOU TO PASS THE A2ZERO PLAN AS A HOMEOER IN WARD 2, I EAGERLY VOTE YOU TO VOTE FOR THE A2ZERO. WE NEED ACTION, NOT OBSTRUCTION. COUNCILMEMBERS NEED TO SUPPORT DENSITY WHEN IT MAKES SENSE, TO ENCOURAGE POLICIES THAT LIMIT CAR AND OIL DEPENDENCE AND GROW THE SUPPLY OF HOUSING IN ANN ARBOR SO ANN ARBOR TEACHER CAN ACTULY LIVE I THE CIT IN WHICH THEY TEACH. THANK YOU. PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT TEACHERS WANT TO WORK IN ANN ARBOR BUT OFTEN CAN'T AFFORD TO. THANKS.
02:59:52.434: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.

I LIVE IN WARD 5 OF ANN ARBOR AND I FEEL I HAVE TO SPEAK OUT BECAUSE I LIKE EVERYONE ELSE AM IN FAVOR OF CLIMATE ACTION. BUT THE A2ZERO PLAN IS NOT A VIABLE PLAN. I WONDER HOW MANY OF THE PEOPLE WHO CALLED IN TONIGHT IN FAVOR OF THE PLAN HAVE ACTUALLY READ IT. HAVE A FEELI MANY HAVE NOT. THE A2ZERO PLAN HAS MANY FLAWS AND IT NEEDS TO BE CHANGED BEFORE IT'S SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED. I HAVE WRITTEN TO CITY COUNCIL ABOUT MY CONCERNS. PLEASE CONSIDER THEM AND PLEASE VOTE NO. THANK YOU
03:00:51.292: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
03:00:55.130: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER 245. CALLER 245, GO AHEAD.

03:01:05.206: >> Mayor Taylor: YES, WE CAN. THANK YOU.
03:01:08.610: >> OKAY. GOOD EVENI, CIT COUNLMEMBERS, AND MAYOR TAYLOR. I'M KATHERINE MURPHY FROM WARD 5, 315 LINDA VISTA STREET. I'M CALLING TONIGHT TO SAY THAT I SUPPORT THE A2ZERO PLAN, AND I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT IT TOO. WE, AS A COUNTRY, STATE, AND A CITY, FACE MTIPLE LIF THREATENING CHALLENGES. WE HAVE FACED THE CLIMATE CRISIS FOR MANY YEARS AND THAT LED YOU TO PASS THE CLIMATE EMERGENCY RESOLUTION BACK IN NOVEMBER OF 2019, THAT SOUGHT CARBON NEUTRALITY IN ANN ARBOR BY 2030. THIS SHOWED TREMENDOUS FORESIGHT BY YOU. IMATE CHANGE I REAL:  THE EFFECTS OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS IN MICHIGAN SEEM EVER MORE CLEAR, EVERY MORE FRIGHTENING. WE BRIDE OURSELVES ON THE BEAUTIFUL GREAT LAKES AND YET LATELY THROUGH CLIMATE CHANGES, THE STORMS ON THE LAKES ARE GETTING MORE VICIOUS. THE WATER IN THE LAKES RISG, DEROYING O BEACHES AND CAUSING PROPERTY DAMAGE. WITH EVER INCREASING RAINFALL, THE WATER TABLE IS HIGH ALL OVER THE STATE AND FLOODING BECOMES EVER MORE POSSIBLE AS THE BREAKING DAMS IN MICHIGAN PROVE. AND WITH THE CHANGING WEATHER PATTERNS COMING AT UNANTICIPATED MES HAVE COMICATED T GROWINSEASON FOR MHIGAN FARMERS. IN ADDITION, WE, AS WELL AS THE WHOLE WORLD HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT OUR C CARBON FOOTPRINT. IN THE MEANTIME, AS THE CLIMATE CRISIS KEEPS UNFOLDING, WE HAVE HAD OTHER CRISIS UNFOLD BEFORE US. THE CORONAVIRUS HAS TAKEN OVER 100,00LIVES, CHANG THEIR WAY OF LIVING A DEVASTATING THE ECONOMY, AND COST BILLIONS. AND NOW WITH THE TRAGIC DEATH OF GEORGE FLOYD, IN MINNEAPOLIS, BY A POLICE OFFICER, WE FIND OURSELVES IN A NEW CRISIS, A PANDEMIC, RACISM AND UNCHECKED POLICE POWER. IT LOOKS LIKE PANDEMICS A CRES OF A TYPES ARE IN OUR FUTURE. THEY SURROUND US NOW. THE A2ZERO PLAN PROVIDES AN EXCELLENT ROADMAP FOR HOW WE CAN RATIONALLY CONFRONT THE CLIMATE CRISIS. BY REACHING --
03:03:35.456: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
03:03:37.992: >> WE WILL BE FIGHTING NOW FOR A LIVABLE CITY FUTURE, I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THE A2ZERO PLAN. THANK YOU.
03:03:49.904: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
03:03:55.943: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER 764. 764, GO AHEAD.
03:04:01.516: >> HI, MY NAME IS SHAWN FLOYD. I'M A A ARBOR NEIGHBOR A I HAVE A BUNCH OF DEGREES AND I'M RAISING THE FUTURE OF ANN ARBOR. THE ATTEMPTS TO BULLY AND INTIMIDATE INTO SILENCE IS UNHELPFUL, EITHER TO SOLVING ISSUES OF CLIMATE CHANGE OR MAINTAINING CIVIL SOCIETY WHICH IS UNDER ATTACK TODAY. ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO, A2D2 PROCESS LO E REZING THE CENTRAL PART OF ANN ARBOR, THAT WERE SUPPOSED TO SOLVE ALL THE PROBLEMS THAT THE REZONING HERE IS SUPPOSED TO SOLVE. IT WAS SUPPOSED TO MAKE ANN ARBOR WALKABLE. IT WAS SUPPOSED TO LOWER RENTS AND IT WAS SUPPOSED TO MAKE THE CITY MORE SUSTAINABLE. THE THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF UNITS HAVE BEEN BUILT, AND YET, APRENTLY NONE OF THESE PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN RESOLVED AT ALL. SO I THINK BEFORE WE EVEN TALK ABOUT REZONING OTHER PARTS OF THE CITY, WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WENT WRONG WITH A2D2. WHY THE D1 AND D2 ZONING SITUATIONS ARE NOT SOLVING ANY PROBLEMS. THEY ARE NOT EVEN CLOSE TO BEING BUILT OUT. D NOW YOU WANT TO GO A REZONEHE REST OF T CITY WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING WHETHER THAT ACTUALLY WILL LOWER RENTS THE WAY D2 AND D1 WERE SUPPOSED TO THE CYNICAL USE OF CLIMATE CLCHANGE AS A COVER FOR UNBRIDLD REAL ESTATE SPECULATION DOES NOT EITHER HELP CARBON REDUCTION OR REDUCE THE AUNT O CICISM ABOUT GOVERNMENT. IN FACT, IT DOES THE REVERSE. IT LEADS TO PEOPLE NOT BELIEVING GOVERNMENT CAN BE TRUSTED AT ALL, AND IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY LEAD TO THE SOLUTIONS THAT WILL AFFECT CLIMATE CHANGE. THE FALSE FRAMING OF THE SOLUTION IN THIS OF ANN ARBOR AS AN ISOLATED ENTITY WANTEDUST LARGER ISSUE SUCH ASNE THE IMPACT OF BUILDING ON THE EDGE OF A METRO AREA, WHICH ANN ARBOR IS, RATHER AN BUILDING IN THE CENTER OF THE METRO AREA, LIKE WHICH IS DETROIT, RIGHT, WHEN YOU BUILD THINGS OUT HERE, YOU DON'T SUPPORT THE CENTER OF THE METRO AREA, WHICH HAS BEEN UNDERPOPULATED FOR HALF A CENTURY. HAVE ANY MEANG AT ALL,OUBLES HAVE T HAVE UTILITY SCALED BATTERY STORES. DISTRIBUTED STORES IS A GREAT PART OF THIS. BUT RIGHT NOW, OUR -- WHEN WE GENERATE ELECTRICITY, RENEWABLES, IT'S NOT WHEN WE ARE ACTUALLY USING THE TRACTOR-TRAILER. AND YOU HAVE TO BURN EITHER COLD OR NATURAL GAS. TO HEIGHTS GO ON AT NIGHT OR USE ELECTRICITY WHEN WE NEED TO USE IT. SO THE PLACES TO PUT IN RESOURCES ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN DIRECT GROWTH BACK INTO THE CENTER OF THE METROPOLITAN AREA, AND SECONDLY, HOW WE CAN DEVOTE RESOURCES INTO UTILITY SCALE BATTERY STRUCTURES THAT ARE NEEDED TO MAKE REWABLES RELEVT FOR CLIMATE USE. I THINK WE NEED TO REDO THIS PLAN. THANK YOU.
03:07:04.232: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
03:07:11.305: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER 249. CALLER 249. GO AHEAD. CALLER 249.
03:07:24.752: >> WOULD IS 249? -- WHO IS 249?
03:07:30.258: >> HI, CAN YOU HEAR US?
03:07:37.365: >> Mayor Taylor: SIR, WOULD YOU LIKE TO SPEAK AT THE PUBLIC HEARING?
03:07:39.500: >> YES, I WOULD. Mayor Taylor:ALL RIGHT, SIR, ITS YOUR TUR U MAY SPEAK NOW, PLEASE.
03:07:50.945: >> AM I UP?
03:07:53.014: >> Mayor Taylor: YES, SIR. PERHAPS TURN YOUR TELEVISION OFF AND FOCUS ON THE PHONE, PLEASE.
03:08:02.390: >> OKAY. YOU KNOW I THINK KA KATHY BORIS AND JOHN FLOYD BOTH HAVE GREAT POINTS. THIS PLAN -- THE LAND USE SEGMENT OF THIS PLAN REALLY FAVORS DEVELOPERS. THEY WILL GO INTO LOWER INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS. THEY WILL BUY UP THE HOMES AND BUILD FOUR-PLEXES. THE IDEA THAT THE ELIMINATION OF SINGLE FIL ZONG AND ALLOWI FOUR-PLEXES BY RIGHT WILL PRODUCE ANY AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS DOUBTFUL. AND THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF HIGH DENSITY HOUSING ELIMINATING SPRAWL BEWILDERS ME. YOU HAVE A LOT OF YOUNG FOLKS LIVING IN THESE HIGH RISES, LIVING IN SMALL APARTNTS, AND TH'S A GREAT IDEA, WHEN YOU ARE OF A CERTAIN AGE BUT AS THEY PEOPLE G GET OLDER AND THEY DECE TO HAVE A FAMILIES AND THEY WANT A DOG, THEY WILL WANT TO HAVE A YARD. THE FACT THAT THEY ARE LIVING IN THESE PLACES IS NOT CONDUCIVE AND, IN FACT, I TALKED TO UP WITH OF MY NEIGHBORS AND I WON'T GO FURER AS TO WO WHO IT IS, BU, YES, WE HAVE THE HIGH-RISES AND WE HAVE THE GREEN BELT AND THIS WILL ELIMINATE SPRAWL AND I SUGGESTED, WELL, LOOK AT CHICAGO. THEY HAVE HIGH RISES A LOT OF HIGH DENSITY HOUSING AND THEY HAVE THOUSANDS OF ACRES OF GREEN SPACE AND THE SPRAWL JUMPED OVER THE GREEN SPACE ANDOVED OUT 5MIE DIRECTION. SO I TRULY BELIEVE THAT THE WHOLE -- THE WHOLE THEORY HERE THAT THIS IS SOMEHOW GOING TO PREVENT SPRAWL AND ELIMINATE THE NEGATIVE CARBON EFFECTS OF SPRAWL IS TOTALLY A FALLACY. I EMPIRICALLY IT'S BEEN PROVEN TO BE WRONG AND THE FACT THAT THE VIRUS, THE COVIDITUATION, IT WL ONLY EXACERBATE THE PEOPLE MOVING FROM HIGH RISES AND MOVING FROM HIGH DENSITY LOCATIONS AND MOVING TO WHERE THEY HAVE SOME GREEN SPACE -- SOME GREEN SPACE AND NOT LIVING IN THESE CONGESTED AREAS. THANK YOU. GLEN ZIGLER, 514 KRAUSS, FIFTH WARD.
03:10:18.225: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.

03:10:45.219: >> HELLO, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
03:10:46.520: >> Mayor Taylor: YES, WE CAN HEAR YOU.
03:10:48.756: >> OKAY. I'M NOT CALLER 118, BUT THAT'S OKAY. MY NAME IS MILT BAKER AND I LIVE UL LIK TOHANK T MAYORNASH AND I D THE COUNC FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP IN DECLARING A CLIMATE EMERGENCY AND SETTING A GOAL OF CARBON NEUTRALITY BY 2030, AND NOW IS THE TIME TO ACT ON THAT GOAL. SINCE THERE'S NO NATIONAL LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE, REDUCING THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE MUST BE DONE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. IN OTHER WORDS, IF WE DON'T DO, IT NOBODY WILL. THE TASK OF MTING THE GOAL WILL N BE EASY. DR. STULTS AND HER TEAM HAVE DONE A GREAT JOB IN PUTTING TOGETHER A SERIES OF RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WILL GET US THERE. THE PLAN MAY NOT BE PERFECT AND THE IMPLEMENTATION WILL BE DIFFICULT, BUT THE ALTERNATIVES ARE MUCH WORSE. YOU HAVE HEARD PEOPLE TONIGHT SAY, OH, LET'S DELAY IT. LET'S -- LET'S CHERRY PICK IT, WHATEVER. THAT JUST ANALYSIS PARALYSIS. THAT LOCKS US UP AND WE DO NOTHING. IN DEALING WITH DR. STULTS' PLAN, THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DIALOGUE ABOUT THE COSTS, AND THIS IS SOMETHING I HAVE NOT HEARD A LOT DISCUSSED BECAUSE VERY LITTLE IS SAID ABOUT THE SAVINGS THAT WE CAN EXPECT. FOR EXAMPLE, ELECTRIC VEHICLES CAUSE 60 TO5% LES TO OPERATE THAN ICE CARS. GREAT RIVER ENERGY IS SHUTTING DOWN AN 1100 MEGA WATT COAL FIRED PLANT IN IN  INNEDDED  IN BECAUSE WIND AND SOLAR ARE CHEAPER. THE POINT IS, WE ARE GOING TO GET SIGNIFICANT GAINS IN REDUCTION IN ADDITION TO REDUCING CARBONERIOUSLY. AND ALONG THESE LINES, I SUPPORT TO BUY BULK BUY. OVERALL, I WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU IMPLEMENT THE RECOMMENDATION OF DR. STULTS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. PLEASE SHOW YOUR LEADERSHIP AND VOTE FOR THIS RESOLUTION. OUR FUTURE, THE FUTURE OF OUR IN THE BALANCE, AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND KIND ATTENTION.
03:13:00.154: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
03:13:01.956: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER 654. CALLER 654, GO HELD.
03:13:05.593: >> MY NAME IS JOHN MERSKI. I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE PAIN AND SUFFERING OF THE LAST MANY WEEKS ESPECIALLY THE LAST SEVERAL DAYS. THIS IS THE TIME FOR ACTION. I THANK YOU FOR DECLARING A CLIMATE EMERGENCY IN SITTING A CARBON NEUTRALITY OF 2030. I URGE YOU TO TAKE THE NEXT STEP TONIGHT TO APPROVE THE A2ZERO PLAN. IT'S TIME TO WALK THE TALK, TO THE ARE LEGIMATE CCERNS OUT THE PLAN THAT DESERVE RESPONSES. IN ADDITION, MULTIPLE FALSE LEADING CLAIMS HAVE BEEN MADE ABOUT IT, THEY UNDERMINE CIVIC DISCOURSE. FIRST THE MAP IS A ROADMAP AND NOT A LICENSE FOR THE CITY AND THE OFFICE OF SUSTAINABILITY TO ACT ULATERALLY:  TY DON'T REQUE ANYE TO ACT AGAINST THEIR WILL. THIS DOESN'T OVERRIDE ANY EXISTING CITY PROCESSES OR TAKE POWER AWAY FROM ANY ENTITY, FOR EXAMPLE, COUNCIL WITH RESPECT TO BUDGET, ZONING AND ORDINANCES, THE U OF M, AAPS, AND PROPERTY OWNERS AND BUSINESS OWNERS. MANY ARE CRITICAL OF THE PLAN'S RECOMMENDED ACTION TO ALLOW BUY RIGHT ADUs, MULTIPLEXES. IT IS IN THE PLAN B BECAUSE IT WOULD LOWER TOTAL EMISSIONS VERSUS THE ALTERNATIVE OF DEVELOPMENT IN OUTLYING COMMUNITIES IN THE ASSOCIATED VEHICLE PILES TRAVELED. IN CONTRAST TO WHAT HAS BEEN IMPLIED TONIGHT, THE PLAN EXPLICITLY STATES THAT THE ACTION IS P PREDICATED ON CITY COUNCIL AND THE PLANNG DEPARTNT AND COMSSION WITH COMMUNIT INPUT APPROVING AN UPDATED COMPREHENSIVE MASTER PLAN. NOTE THE PLAN DOES NOT ADVOCATE FOR NEW DOWNTOWN HIGH RISES. A CHARGE HAS BEEN MADE THAT BECAUSE THERE ARE INCONSISTENT OFFSET FIGURES IN THE PLAN, NO FIGURE CAN BE TRUSTED. ACTUALLY, THE OFFSET FIGURES ARE CONSTENT. E PLAN CALLS FOR 13.6 OF EMISSIONS BEING OFFSET ON PAGE 11 AND 121. IT'S CLEARLY STATED ON PAGE 121 THAT THE 45.3% CITED THERE IS, QUOTE, THE AMOUNT OF OFFSETS THAT WILL BE NEEDED TO PURCHASE IF THE UNIVERSITY DOES NOT PAICIPATE IN ANY OF THE ACTIONS OUTLINED, UNQUOTE. SOME ARGUE THE PLAN IS EXPENSIVE. IT IS THAT THE COST OF INACTION IS MUCH HIGHER. THE SOCIAL COST OF CARBON EMISSIONS THAT HAS BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE 1.15 BILLION EVERY DECADE AND THAT EXCLUDES ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGES. Clerk Beaud: 30 SECONDS.
03:15:42.549: >> THIISN IESTMENT I CARBON AND POLLUTION-FREE AIR WITH MANY CO-BENEFITS INCLUDING A MORE VIBRANT, EFFICIENT AND EQUITABLE LOCAL ECONOMY. IT'S NO DIFFERENT THAN A2'S INVESTMENT IN CLEAN WATER. OTHERS PROPOSE ONLY IMPLEMENTING LOW HANGING HIGH RETURN ON INVESTMENT ACTIONS. DOING SO WILL HAVE US FALL SHORT OFARBON NEUTRALITY, AND IT ADDS UP TO GET US ACROSS THE GOAL LINE. OTHER CONCERNS CLAIMS AND COMPLAINTS HAVE BEEN RAISED.
03:16:19.853: >> Clerk Beaudry: TIME.

IT WAS CREATED WITH THE COOPERATION OF A LOT OF PEOPLE AND A LOT OF PEOPLE PUT A LOT OF HARD WORK INTO IT. CALLS FHANGES. IT CALLS FOR US TO CHANGE SOME OF THE THINGS ABOUT WHAT WE DO, INCLUDING LAND USE. IF THESE CHANGES -- IF WE COULD -- IF WE COULD SOLVE THE CLIMATE CRISIS WITHOUT CHANGING THINGS ABOUT THE WAY THAT WE DO THINGS, THEN WE WOULDN'T NEED THE A2ZERO PLAN. WE NEED THE A2ZERO PLAN BECAUSE WE NEED TO CNGE SETHING WEUTUR BEST A BRITEST THIS CHARGE OF SAYING WHAT IS IT THAT WE NEED TO DO DIFFERENTLY AND THIS IS THE ANSWER. THIS IS WHAT THEY CAME UP WITH.

AND JUST TO LET YOU KNOW, I HAVE CONSIDERED -- I WOULD LIKE TO -- I AND MY WIFE WOULD LIKE TO AGE IN PLACE IN ANN ARBOR. I HAVE A DOUBLE LOT. I WOULD LOVE TO BUILDN ADU SO THATY WIFE AND I COULD PASS THE HOUSE ALONG TO ONE OF MY CHILDREN. BUT I CAN'T DO THAT UNDER CURRENT RULES AND REGS FROM ANN ARBOR. THE OTHER THING I WOULD URGE ANN ARBOR TO DO ISHANGE THE ZONING. CHANGE THE MASTER PLAN TO ACCOMMODATE GREATER DENSITY DUPLEXES, TRIPLEXES, QUADPLEXES. GET OVER THE FEAR OF DENSITY IN DOWNTOWN AND IN NEAR DOWNTOWN NEIGHBORHOODS AND ALONG TRANSIT LINES IN PARTICULAR.

03:22:38.865: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER 367.
03:22:40.600: >> YES, MAYOR AND COUNCIL, THIS IS BRIAN CHAMBERS FROM THE THIRD WARD. COUNCIL, YOU HAVE BEEN DOING A GANG BUSTER JOB ADDRESSING CRITICAL OPTIONS IN OUR COMMUNITY THAT DIRECTLY REFLECT OUR RESIDENTS VALUES AND ASPIRATIONS TORE CLIMATE ACTION, AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND THE SIDENTS, WORORCE BUSINESSESF OUR AND GUESTSO OUR CITY. COUNCIL SHOWED LEADERSHIP AND BOLD -- AND MADE A BOLD STEP BY DECLARING THE CLIMATE EMERGENCY UNANIMOUSLY. SETTING THE TARGET TO 2030 EVEN MORE AGGRESSIVELY THAN INITIALLY PROPOSED REALLY ESTABLISHED THE TARGET FOR NOT ONLY THE A2ZERO UPDATE HAVING ESTABLISHED CARBON NEUTRALITY, IT PROVIDES THE FRAMEWORK FOR THE LAND USE UPDATES THAT COULD HAVE EASILIED IT TO UNRAVEL IF IT WAS NOT ALREADY ESTABLISHED. COUNCILMEMBERS NEED APPRECIATION. EVEN IN THE TIME OF PANDEMIC AND COLLAPSING CITY RECEIVE KNEWS COUNCIL MAINTAINED THE CLIMATE ACON AND AFFORDABLE HSING I THE FISCAL YEAR '21 BUDGET. THIS IS PHENOMENAL. NOW BEFORE COUNCIL IS TO TAKE THE NEXT STEP ON THE A2ZERO PLAN. IT WOULD BE HARD WORK AND IT WILL PROBABLY ONLY GET HARDER. THAT WILL REQUIRE THE GREATER ANN ARBOR COMMUNITY TO WORK ON THESE CONTINUALLY HELD VALUE D ON THIVES. TONITING AROUND T SETTLEMENT, AND -- IT WILL NOT BE EASY OR CHEAP. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE NOT IGNORE THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC ISSUES OF EQUITY, NOR THAT WE TREAT EQUITY AS AN EXOGENOUS FACTOR. TRADEOFFS ON SOCIAL AND EQUITY IMPACT WILL ND TO BENALYZED EVERY STEP OF THE WAY THE A2ZERO PLAN AS A DRAFT, TAKES AN INITIAL STEP TO DEAL THE WITH THE CORE ISSUES. ONE KEY ADDITION I WOULD RECOMMEND, STANDARD FOR BEST PRACTICE RESIDENT IS A RISK REGISTER. RISK AS DISCUSSED IN TIR INCLUDE COLLABORATION WITHIN THE UNIVERSITY, DEPENDENTS ON A ATA FUNDING AND NEW BUDGET SYSTEMS AND COOPERATION WITH YES, LAND USE POLICY, AMONG OTHERS. EACH WILL NEED A RISK MITIGATION PLAN. THE A2ZERO PLAN IS OBJECTIVELY AN EXCELLENT PLAN BASED ON SEN NDAMENTAL A NECESSARY STRATEGIES.
03:25:12.819: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
03:25:13.620: >> I CAN ACCEPT ACTIONS AND STRATEGIES MAY NOT ALL HAVE UNANIMOUS SUPPORT. BUT THEY DO FORM THE BASIS FOR CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT. IT WILL REQUIRE A WILLINGNESS TO ENGAGE IN THE PERSONAL COMMITMENT OF EVERYONE. THESE ACTS WILL NOT HAPPEN ON THEIR OWN NOR SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY ARE IN THE PLAN. LET US WORK TOGETHE ANDESOLVE THEEMAINING ISSUES FOR THE OWN PERSONAL ACTIONS AND POSITIVE APPROACHES TO CHALLENGES. POSITIVE CRITIQUES IN THE INVESTIGATION OF CONSTRUCTIVE ALTERNATIVES AND OPTIONS WILL REQUIRE THAT WE STAY ALIGNED AT THE CITY. I BELIEVE WITH THE 64 PARTNERS ALREADY SIGNED ON TO THE A2ZERO PLAN THAT WE HAVE A SOLID COMMUNITY BASE.
03:25:50.156: >> Clerk Beaudry: TIME.
03:25:50.957: >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND I LOO FORWARDO YR ADOPTION OF THE PLAN LET'S DO IT!
03:25:58.898: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
03:26:01.201: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER 556. CALLER 556. GO AHEAD.
03:26:05.038: >> THANK YOU. RALPH MCKEE FIFTH WARD. LET'S START WITH THIS PREMISE. EVERYONE IN ANN ARBOR WANTS TO STOP CLIMATE CHANGE. THE ANN BOR OR A2ZER PLAN IS AS ADVERTISED, AMBITIOUS, BOLD, CHALLENGING. AND I HAVE TO ADMIT THIS IS THE -- MAYBE THE BEST ARE LOCAL POLITICAL PR CAMPAIGN I HAVE EVER SEEN IN THE 40 YEARS I HAVE LIVED HERE, OR ALMOST 50. EVENTS, CLIMATE VOTER CAMPAIGNS, NATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, AND SPEAKER AFTER SPEAKER EXTREME HELUENT, ESPECIALLY THE YOUNG PEOPLE AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT. AND AFTER HEARING THOSE SPEECHES, I FEEL KIND OF LIKE A LONELY VOICE IN THE WILDERNESS HERE. OR SOMEONE POINTING OUT THAT WILL EMPEROR HAS NO CLOTHES BUT AS SOME RESIDENTS HAVE NOTED TONIGHT AND IN DETAILED LETTERS TO COUNCIL AND PARTICULARLY IN VIVIAN ARMATRA'S BLOG, THE PLANASEVERE FLAWS. THE ZONING CHANGE, THE ELIMINATION OF SINGLE FAMILY ZONING, WHAT IS IN THE PLAN IS SIMPLY NOT ACCURATE. SHOULD THAT MATTER? I THINK IT SHOULD BECAUSE EVERYONE WANTS TO STOP CLIMATE CHANGE. LET'S LOOK CLOSER. THE PLAN SAYS VERY SIM MY THAT IT WOULD HELP LOW-INCOME FOLKS AND RENTERS ANDEDUCE INCE SPEAKER AFTER SPEAKER TONIGHT HAS TALKED ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING, PARTICULARLY, THE YOUNG FOLKS, AND I APPRECIATE THAT. DO YOU KNOW WHAT? DR. STULTS HAS ACKNOWLEDGED AFTER BEING CHALLENGED ON THAT POINT THAT THIS PLAN WILL NOT ADD AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND I WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU AND I HAVE SENT DETAILED ANALYSES TO SOME OF YOU. IT WOULD ACTUALLY ELIMINATE A LOT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SO WHERE WAS THAT ANALYSIS BEFORE THE PLAN WAS RELEASED AND WHY WASN'T THE -- THE ITEM IN TH PLAN SLL O THE WEBSITE SAYING, TS WILL -- THIS WILL HELP LOW-INCOME FOLKS AND RENTERS. IT WON'T. DR. STULTS HAS ADMITTED IT WON'T, BUT IT'S STILL ON THE WEBSITE AND SPEAKER AFTER SPEAKER FOCUSES ON THAT THINKING THAT THIS PLAN WILL DO THAT. DO THESE FACTS MATTER? I THINK THEY DO, BECAUSE EVERYBODY WANTS TO STOP CLIMATE CHAN. LET' LOOK EVEN CLOSE THERE'S A HOUSE RIGHT NOW NEAR HASLEY THAT'S FOR SALE FOR $285,000 AND ANOTHER OFFERED TO RENT FOR $1,700. NOT AFFORDABLE BUT PROBABLY AFFORDABLE. IF YOU DO THE MATH, THE -- IF YOU TEAR THAT HOUSE DOWN AND BUILD QUAD PLEXES AT TODAY'S CONSTRUCTION PCES, THAT'S GOING TO SOLVE FOR 415,000 OR MORE AND RENT FOR UP TO $4,000. THAT'S NOT AFFORDABLE. THAT PART OF THE PLAN OUGHT TO BE TAKEN BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD. IF YOU WANT DENSITY, FIGURE OUT ANOTHER WAY TO DO IT BECAUSE THIS WAY IS NOT THE WAY TO GO. THANK YOU.
03:29:08.188: >> Mayor Taylo THANK YOU.
03:29:14.661: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER 711.
03:29:15.662: >> YES. MY NAME IS WENDY CARMAN AND I LIVE AT 2340 GEORGETOWN. I SUPPORT A2ZERO INITIATIVE FOR ANN ARBOR, HOWEVER, I'M UP HAPPY WITH A LOT OF DETAILS IN THIS DOCUMENT. I DON'T LIKE TO PASS IT NOW AND FIX IT LATER APPROACH. I DON'TANT YOU TO VOTE TS DOWN, BUT IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO ADOPT THIS PLAN NOW TO PURSUE THE CLIMATE INITIATIVE. IT CAN GO FORWARD WITHOUT BEING OFFICIALLY ADOPTED. WE ALREADY FUNDED SUSTAINABILITY OFFICE AND HAVE BUDGETED THE NEXT YEAR OF THIS PLAN. WE WOULDN'T BE HOLDING UP PROGRESS. THE DOCUMENT HAS ERRORS, LANSING NEEDS TO BE CONVIED T CHANG LAWS A WE NEED TO FIND OUTSIDE SOURCES TO HELP LOWER THE TAX BURDEN. REMEMBER, EVEN WITHOUT ADOPTION, STAFF CAN BRING FORWARD ANY ONE OF THE 44 PROPOSED ACTIONS TO CITY COUNCIL FOR APPROVAL. WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THIS IS A LIVING DOCUMENT. WE CAN EXPECT IT TO CHANGE IF OUR BUDGET DEFICIT GROWS, IF THERE ARE ERRORS DISCOVERED, IF THE ARE CHANG IN TECHNOLOGY. SO WHAT DOES ADOPTION MEAN BEYOND RECEIVING THE PLAN. IF IT IS ADOPTED, WILL IT BECOME THE PART OF THE MASTER PLAN AND IF SO, HOW WILL IT BE USED BEFORE THE MASTER PLAN IS UPDATED. IS THE REASON FOR ADOPTING IT NOW, IT WILL BECOME THE FOUNDATIONAL DOCUMENT IN OUR MASTER PLAN AS BRIAN CHAERS S SUGGESTED, BEYOND THAT THE FEATURES PLAN, SINCE WE ARE DEFERRING THE UPDATING OF THAT PLAN FOR MORE THAN A YEAR, WE CAN'T EVEN LOOK AT THIS IN THIS CONTEXT IN AN OPEN FORUM LIKE WE SHOULD. THE PROPOSED PLAN CALLED FOR ALLOWING SINGLE FAMILY AND DUPLES TO BE CONVERTED TO QUADRAPLEXS BY RIGHT. THAT WOULD WHY YIELD .017 REDUCTION IN GREEN HOUSE GASES. EVEN WITH THE AMENDED TEXT, THAT MAY BE SUBMITTED TONIGHT, THE MASTER PLAN PROCESS SHOULD BE IN MACE NOT THE A2ZERO PLAN, WHERE IS THE TRANSPARENT'S TRANSPARENCY HERE. PLAN HAVE SPORTED ELIMITING SINGLE FAMILY ZONINGS AND TELL US WHETHER THE DENSITY IS GOOD FOR US. WE KNOW IT'S GOOD FOR DEVELOPERS BUT DENSITY COMES WITH COST TO RESIDENTS THAT HAVEN'T BEEN REVEALED HERE. WE HAVE LABELED THIS PLAN AN URGENT RESPONSE TO AN URGENT CRISIS, BUT THAT NOW FACES OTHER CRISIS, THE BUDGET KIND, CONSEQUENCESFOVID A THE PONTIAL CONSEQUCES OF A CONTAMINATED DRINKING WATER, STORM AND FLOODING ISSUES AND RECYCLING THAT DOESN'T WORK. CLERCLERK 30 SECONDS.
03:31:54.087: >> WHAT IS THE REASON FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AT THIS TIME? IT'S A GUIDE. DIRECTION SHOULD BE GIVEN TO MOVE US TOWARDS APPROPRIATE ACTIONSUT IT SHOULDN'T BE ADOPTEDS A WHOLE AT THI TIME. THANK YOU.
03:32:09.702: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
03:32:23.016: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER 310. GO AHEAD.
03:32:25.018: >> HI, CAN YOU HR ME. Mayor Taylo YES, WE CAN.
03:32:29.022: >> GREAT. JULIE RIVER, OLD FOURTH WARD, THE MOST DENSELY PART OF ANN ARBOR, OUR 4C ZONING WITH QUALIFIED SUPPORT FOR THE PLAN. SO MANY ENTHUSIASTIC SUPPORTERS OF THE CURRENT ANN ARBOR ZERO PLAN TONIGHT SPEAKING SO MUCH TRUTH. SO MANY PEOPLE ASPIRING TO OVERWHELMING CHALLENGE.Y EVERYONE ON COUNCIL AND EVERYONE RUNNING FOR COUNCIL AND ALL OF THE SPEAKERS TONIGHT AND PROBABLY ALMOST ALL CITIZENS HAVE SINCERELY SUPPORT THE INTENTIONS AND THE DIRECTIONS OF THIS PLAN. HOWEVER, IT IS CLEAR LISTENING TO MANY OF THE POSITIVE SPEAKERS TONIGHT THAT AS MUCH AS THEY SUPPORT THE VISION, THEY DO NOT IMPLEMENTAON TO THE PCES OF THIS PUZZLE. FOR EXAMPLE, ITEM 4.5, ELIMINATING THE SINGLE FAMILY ZONING AND ALLOWING BUY RIGHT UPZONING WILL NOT COME BACK TO COUNCIL. IT WILL BECOME PART OF THE CITY'S LAND USE PLAN AND GOING FORWARD, ANY SINGLE FAMILY HOME WILL BE ABLE TO BE DEMOLISHED AND REPLACED WITH A MULTIUNIT BUILDING, PERIOD. AND NOT NECESSARILY AFFORDABLE UNS. THIS TOPIC, TONIGHT THE DTE REPRESENTATIVE ALREADY SPOKE AND SAID THAT ELECTRIFICATION OF NEW CONSTRUCTION AND COMMUNITY AGGREGATED PURCHASING ARE NOT SUPPORTED BY DTE. THESE ARE TWO VERY BIG PIECES OF THE PUZZLE. NO ONE IS TALKING ABOUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE COST FOR THE NEW ELECTRIC BUSES. THERE ARE PROBLEMS WITHHIS PROGM. SERIS HOLES YET PEOE WHO QUESTION THE EXISTENCE OF THESE PROBLEMS ARE BEING CALLED IMMORAL, AND THREATENED WITH ALL KINDS OF DIRE SEQU CONSEQUENCESN IF ALL THEY WANT TO DO IS PAUSE THE PRO E SI PROCESS TO FIX THE. THE REALITIES AND THE PROBLEMS ARE NOT GOING TO GO AWAY. THEY NEED TO BE ADDRESSED BEFORE THEY WILL BECOME OBSTACLES THAT MAY VERY WELL DERAIL SOME OF THE CENTRAL EFFORTS.
03:34:21.434: >> THE EFFORTS IN THIS PLAN HAVE ALREADY BEEN FUNDED FOR THE NEXT YEAR. THEY WILL GO AHEAD ALL BY THEMSELVES NO MATTER WHAT THE VOTE IS TONIGHT. SO THERE'S NO DANGER THAT THINGS WILL COME TO A SCREECHING HALT IF THE PLAN IS IMPROVED BEFORE IT'S APPROVED. MAKE IT ACCURATE AND THE LAND USE CHANGES WHERE THEY BELONG IN THE MASTER PLAN PROCESS, MAKE SURE THE PLAN WE END UP WILL INSPIRE THE UNIVERSITY, INSPIRE DTE AND INSPIRE THE STATE. ALL OF TONIGHT'S WELL-INTENTIONED CHEERLEADING --
03:34:52.598: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
03:34:54.167: >>  -- IN THESE PLACES TO BRING THESE PROPOSALS TO LIFE UNLESS THEY ARE IMPROVED. WITHLEAR HEADE CLEARYED WORK, ACT CUR ACCURACY IN CITY L ALLOW THE DOCUMENT TO FULFILL ITS POTENTIAL. ACCEPT THE PLAN AND IMPROVE IT AND APPROVE IT. ACCEPT, IMPROVE, APPROVE. THANK YOU.
03:35:20.059: >> Mayor Taylor: TNK YOU. ERK MAYOR, THERE AREOORE CALLERS WITH THEIR HANDS UP.
03:35:25.398: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING? SEEING NO ONE THIS PUBLIC HEARING IS CLOSED. IT'S -- WHY DON'T WE TAKE A SHORT BREAK. IT'S 10:39. LET US RECONVENE AT 150, PLEASE. [ BREAK ]
03:48:49.935: >> Mayor Tayr: WE ARE BACK AFTER A SORT BREAK. WE HAVE BEFORE US A1, THE WORK AND THE SPECIAL SESSION MINUTES OF MAY 11 AND REGULAR SESSION MEETING MINUTES OF MAY 18, 2020, MAY I HAVE A MOTION TO APPROVE THESE MINUTES. MOVED BY RAMLAWI AND SECONDED BY ACKERMAN. DISCUSSION OF MINUTES. ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AS]
03:49:09.955: >> Mayor Taylor: THE MINUTES ARE APPROVED. WE GO TO DC-1, IS THAT RIGHT COUNCILMEMBER? COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
03:49:26.972: >> Clerk Beaudry: MAYOR, THAT'S CORRECT.
03:49:28.140: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. DC-1, RESOLUTION REGARDING WER RAS. MOVED BYOUNCILMEMBER LUMM, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD. DISCUSSION OF DC-1, COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
03:49:42.454: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANKS, MR. MAYOR. BEFORE DIVING, IN I NEED TO MAKE ONE CHANGE SUGGESTED BY MR. POSTEMA, AND THAT IS TO STRIKE THE WORDS "IF DETERMINED NECESSARY BY CITY SFF," IN THE SECOND RESOLVE CLAUSE. IT'S COUNCIL'S RESPONSIBILITY TO SET RATES, TO MR. POSTEMA RECOMMENDED THAT PHRASE BE TAKEN OUT. IS THAT FRIENDLY TO THE BODY?
03:50:06.845: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE A SECOND TO THAT? SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD. IS THAT FRIENDLY TO THE BODY? HAVEHE FLOOR. LUMM, Y STI
03:50:17.823: >> Councilmember Lumm: THIS IS THE RESOLUTION THAT WE BEGAN TO DISCUSS AT THE BUDGET MEETING. WHAT THE RESOLUTION DOES IS DEFER THE WATER RATE INCREASES PROPOSED FOR JULY 1, 2020, UNTIL JANUARY 1, 2021. AND TAKE THAT TIME TO REVISIT THE WATER RATE STRUCTURE CHANGES ADOPTED IN 2018. IT'S VERYMPTANT UNDERSTANDHAT TS DEFERRA IS REVENUE NEUTRAL FOR THE SYSTEM. THE SECOND RESOLVE CLAUSE EXPLICITLY ADDRESSES THAT. MR. CRAWFORD PROVIDED THE NUMBERS AND WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS THAT RATHER THAN HAVE A 6.5% INCREASE IN JULY 2020, THIS WOULD BE A 13.3% INCREASE IN NUARY 2021. FISCAL YEAR '21 THAT RECOVERS THE LOWER REVENUE FIRST MONTHS AND PRIOR REVENUE IN THE SECOND SIX MONTHS AND IT ELIMINATES THE NEED FOR A FISCAL YEAR 2022 INCREASE IN JULY '21 -- 2021 OR AT LEA REDUCES I BY 6.5%. SO PLEASE BE CLEAR, THIS RESOLUTION IS REVENUE NEUTRAL. IT DOES NOT REDUCE THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF REVENUE TO THE WATER SYSTEM IN FISCAL YEAR '21 OR IN FUTURE YEARS. WHAT THE RESOLUTION DOES DO IT FURTHER INCREASE AND UTILIZE THAT TIME TO REVISIT THE WATER RATE STRUCTURE I KNOW AT A LEAST A FEW OF US ARE UNCOMFORTABLE. SPECIFICALLY THE ARE E SO ILLUSION DIRECTS STAFF TO REVIEW THE RATE STRUCTURE ALTERNATIVES PRESENTED BY ARCADIS. THE WIDE RANGE OF PER GALLON CHARGES  ANN ARBOR'S RESIDENTL CUSTOMER CLASS. TWO, THE LACK OF ANY MECHANIC NEXT IN THE CUSTOMER CLASS RATE AND REFLECT THE SYSTEM COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PEAKING. THREE, THE VALIDITY OF THE COST OF SERVICE STUDY RESULTS GIVEN THE ACTUAL USAGE EXPERIENCED SUBSEQUENT TO RESTRUCTURI. I FLYECOGNIZE THA STAFF DOES NOT SUPPORT ALTERNATIVES. THEY STAND BEHIND THE RESTRUCTURING IN 2018. THAT'S FINE AND THIS RESOLUTION IS NOT INTENDED TO ASK THEM TO CHANGE THEIR POSITION AND DOES NOT CONTEMPLATE A MAJOR NEW STUDY. WHAT THE RESOLUTION IS REQUESTING FROM STAFF, HOWEVER, IS A GOOD FAITH EFFORT IN USING THEIR EXPERTISE TO HELP IDENTIFY AT CLDE REASONABLE ALTERNATIVES AND APPROACHES TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS. THE RESOLUTION DOES NOT PRESUME AN ANSWER. IT SIMPLY ASKS FOR STAFF'S RECOMMENDATIONS WITH REGARD TO THE ART OF THE POSSIBLE. AND IF STAFF DOES NOT NEED NINE MONTHS FOR A GOOD FAITH EFFORT AND WE PREFER A SHORTER TIME FRAME, I'M FINE WITH THAT. AS I MENTION LAST MEETING,HE DECISIERE IS VER STRAIGHTFORWARD. IF COUNCILMEMBERS ARE COMFORTABLE WITH THE STRUCTURE AND DON'T WANT TO INVEST SOME ADDITIONAL STAFF TIME, YOU SHOULD VOTE NO. BUT IF YOU BELIEVE AS I DO THAT COUNCIL SHOULD TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT THE WATER RATE STRUCTURE, AND UNCOORTABLE WITH, YOU SHOUL VOTE YES. AGAIN, THIS IS NOT A QUESTION ABOUT REVENUES TO THE WATER SYSTEM. THE SYSTEM IS MADE WHOLE. IT'S REALLY A SIMPLE QUESTION. SHOULD WE INVEST STAFF IN NOT?SITING RATE STRUCTURE OR OBVIOUSLY I BELIEVE WE SHOULD AND THANK YOU FOR LISTENING.
03:53:59.744: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
03:54:06.051: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THE PERSISTENCE COUNCILMEMBER LUMM HAS ON THIS ISSUE. IT HAS BEEN A DOGGED FIGHT FROM THE START AND IT CONTINUES. I DON'T THINK THIS -- YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT SOMETHING I WOULD JUMP OUT AND SUPPORT AS I DO ON SOME THINGS THAT ARE BROUGHT TO US. BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT OUR CURRENT SYSTEM IS FLAWED. AND IT'S -- IT' FLAWED ANDT'S EVIDENT, JUST WIT THE SHORTCOMINGS THAT WE PROJECTED THAT WE WOULD BE GETTING FROM TIER 4. IT'S A DRASTIC REDUCTION IN REVENUE. WE MISSED OUR MARK MIGHTILY, AND AS WE CONTINUE TO GO DOWN THAT, I THINK WE WILL CONTINUE TO MISS OUR MARK WITH HIGHER TIER. THEY WILL NOT GET THE REVUE TH WE WLD PJECT THAT WE WOULD RECEIVE. WE ARE, I THINK, HEADED TOWARDS BIGGER AND BIGGER PROBLEMS IF WE CONTINUE IN THIS FLAWED SYSTEM. SO IN THAT SPIRIT, I WILL SUPPORT MY COLLEAGUE'S ATTPT TO HAV STA REVISIT THIS, BECAUSE I FEEL IF WE CONTINUE TO GO DOWN THIS PATH, WE WILL JUST HAVE A BIGGER AND BIGGER PROBLEM TO SOLVE LATER. I THINK TAKING IT ON NOW AND TRYING TO ADDRESS IT NOW WILL STAVE OFF BIGGER INCREASES LATER FOR FOLKS BECAUSE I JUS-- I JUSTAVE A CRENT PROBLEMITH IT AND IT'S EVIDENT IN THE FACT THAT THE REVENUE IS PROJECTED TO COME FROM TIER FOUR. WE ARE OFF THE MARK BY A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT.
03:55:56.461: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
03:55:57.529: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. I THINK COUNCILMEMBER LUMM STATED IT PRETTY ELOQUENTLY THAT IF YOU ARE COMFORTABLE WIT THE CURRENT STRUCTURE AND YOU DON'T WANT SFF TO INVEST ADDITIONAL TIME THAT WE SHOULD VOTE NO. SO I AM COMFORTABLE WITH THE CURRENT STRUCTURE. I DON'T WANT STAFF TO INVEST MORE TIME, BUT I DO WANT TO SAY WHY I'M COMFORTABLE WITH IT AND WHAT WORRIES ME ABOUT MAKING A SHIFT WHERE WE DOUBL THEATES FOR X MONTHS. IF WE CHANGE WHO WARE CHARGING THEN THAT DOUBLING, I BELIEVE, WILL HAVE A MUCH LARGER IMPACT ON SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE WOULD CAN AFFORD IT THE LEAST. WE KNOW THAT BASED ON OUR STUDY THE LAST TIME THAT LED TO THE CHANGE IN THE WATER, IT'S THAT -- THAT MULTIFAMILY HOMES WERE SUBSIDIZI SINGLE FAMY HOMESECAUSE IT COST MORE TO DELIVER WATER TO SINGLE FAMILY MULTIFAMILY RESIDENCES. IT'S NOT A REALLY COMPLICATED CONCEPT. SO BECAUSE OF THAT, IF WE WERE TO CHANGE THE WAY THAT I THINK SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES WOULD LIKE TO SEE US GO, AND WE DOUBLE THE RATES FOR THE SECOND SIX MONTHS, DOUBLE THE INCREE, ANY WAY, I THINK THAT WILL DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT PEOPLE WHO RIGHTLY ARE NO LONGER SUBSIDIZING WATER RATES IN THE SAME WAY. I DEFINILY WILL N SPORT IS AND I DON'T WT STA TO SPEND TIME ON THIS WHEN THEY NEED TO SPEND TIME OR OTHER CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS.
03:57:40.431: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI. YOU'RE ON MUTE COUNCILMEMBER.
03:57:46.237: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THERE WE GO. I JUST HAD A QUICK QUESTION. I SHOULD HAVE ASKED THIS THE FIRST TIME I SPOKE. PARTF THE AGENDA WHERE STAFF IS PROPOSING TO INCREASE THE CURRENT RATES ON THE CURRENT STRUCTURE. I HAVE A QUESTION REGARDING PART OF THE ORDINANCE, SECTION 2.63, WHERE IT BREAKS DOWN THE WATER RATE BY UNIT AND THEN ALSO BY RESIDENTIA CLA AND IROBABLY SHOULD KNOW THIS ANSWER ALREADY AND I APOLOGIZE I DON'T. WE BREAK IT DOWN BETWEEN RESIDENTIAL ONE AND RESIDENTIAL TWO. AND AGAIN, THIS IS CHAPTER 29, SECTION 2.693. COULD SOMEONE EXPLAIN TO ME THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE TWO ASSES OF RESIDTIAL CUSTOMERS?
03:58:42.760: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. HUPY?
03:58:43.328: >> I WILL DEFER TO LYNNE CHAIMOWITZ WHO IS MORE INVOLVED IN THIS.
03:58:54.839: >> RESIDENTIAL TWO, THEY HAVE A WATER METER ONLY ON THEIR ACCOUNT. SO THE WER ONLONSUMPTION I BILLED AT THE $9 RATE, AND THE RESIDENTIAL METER IS PILLED AT RES TWO RATE AND IT'S CAPPED OUT AT TIER 2 IF YOU ALSO HAVE A WATER METER. DOES IT MAKE SENSE.
03:59:19.864: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  IT WHEN YOUAYT'S CAPPED AT RATE AT TIER TWO, IT'S CAPPED AT TIER TWO FOR WHAT CLASS?
03:59:29.273: >> RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS. THIS IS FOR RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS ONLY.
03:59:33.911: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS WATER ONLY?
03:59:36.648: >> IN A RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMER HAS TWO METERS ON THEIR ACCOUNT, IF THEY HAVE THEIR STANDARD RESIDEIAL METER A WELL A WATER-ONLY METER, THAT'S USED FOR WATER ONLY PURPOSES, AND DOESN'T FLOW INTO THE SEWER, THEN THEY ARE GIVEN THE RESIDENTIAL TWO RATE FOR THEIR PRIMARY RESIDENTIAL METER. AND ANY CONSUMPTION OVER TIER TWO IS BILLED AT THATES2 RATE.
04:00:10.481: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  AND DO WE HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT PERCENTAGE OF OUR CAPACITY FALLS UNDER THAT PARTICULAR SUB SUBSEF CUSTOMER?
04:00:21.626: >> I DON'T HAVE THE EXACT NUMBER, BUT THERE'S A SMALLER SET OF CUSTOMERS THAT HAVE THE TWO METS.
04:00:27.298: >> Couilmember Ramwi: OKAY. THANK YOU.
04:00:32.336: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCIL MEMBER LUMM.
04:00:38.076: >> Councilmember Lumm: I WOULD LIKE TO WAIT TO COMMENT.
04:00:41.879: >> Mayor Taylor: ALL RIGHT.
04:00:42.680: >> Councilmember Lumm: TO REACT TO OTHER COMMENTS.
04:00:44.849: >> Mayor Taylor: VERY GOOD. COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
04:00:46.951: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I JUST WANTE TO CMENT AND THANK COUNCILMEMBER LUMM FOR BRINGING THIS UP FOR A REASON THAT COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI BROUGHT UP ABOUT HOW THIS IS -- THIS CHANGE IN THE RATE STRUCTURE HAS IMPACTED OUR REVENUE IN A WAY THAT WAS NOT EXPECTED. AND I REMEMBER IN ONE OF THE PREVIOUS CONVERSATIONS ABOUT OUR WATER RATE STRUCTURE, IT WAS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THIS WAS NOT INTENDEDO BE WATER CONSERVATION TOOL OR A WAY OF INCENTIVIZING WATER CONSERVATION, BUT ULTIMATELY, IT HAS FUNCTIONED THAT WAY. PEOPLE ARE UN UN USING LESS WAT. AND WE ARE NOT GETTING THE REVENUE FROM TIER FOUR THAT WE WILL THOUGHT AND THAT'S MEANINGFUL. THE ISSUE OF REVENUE IS ALSO MEINGFUL TOE, IN TERMS OF HOW THIS PUTS OFF $700,000 IN REVENUE AND I APPRECIATE IT'S REVENUE NEUTRAL AND WE ARE KICKING THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD BUT I'M EXTREMELY CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT OUR REVENUE STREAM IS GOING TOGOING TO LOOK LIKE FOR F THE REVENUE DOESN'T COME BACK. I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SUPPORT APPRIATE WHERE I COM FROM. AND I -- MAYBE IF THE CIRCUMSTANCES WERE DIFFERENT, I COULD SUPPORT IT, BUT I'M JUST VERY UNCOMFORTABLE WITH US HOLDING BACK ON AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET MORE REVENUE UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES. BUT, YEAH, IT'S KIND OF A BIG DEAL THAT THE REVENUE DID NOT TURN OUT THE WAY WE EXPECTED IT TO. I THINK THATROBABLYOES IO DOES D TO BE TALKED ABOUT A LITTLE BIT TOO.
04:02:22.513: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
04:02:23.848: >> Councilmember Hayner:  JUST BECAUSE WE WENT DOWN THE QUESTION ROAD A LITTLE WAYS, THIS REPORT THAT WE ARE GOING TO REFER BACK TO, WHERE IN THERE DO I FIND THIS NOTION THAT -- YOU KNOW, IS THERE A TABLE OR SOMETHING IN THEREHATILL SHOW ME EXALY HOW IT IS THAT IT DOES COST MORE TO DELIVER TO SINGLE FAMILY VERSUS MULTIFAMILY? HOW IS THAT -- WE KEEP HEARING THAT AND I'M JUST WONDERING WITH DO I FIND THE DATA THAT SUPPORTS THAT? IS THERE -- I MEAN, ALL I KNOW ABOUT GALLON PER MINUTES FOR GALLON PER MINUTE VERSUS THE SIZE OF E LINE AND THINGSIKE THAT. I UNDERSTAND PLUMBING PHYSICALLY BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW WE HAVE COME TO THIS DETERMINATION THAT IT -- YOU KNOW WHERE DO I FIND THAT IN OUR REPORT?
04:03:11.829: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. HUPY?
04:03:12.430: >> AGAIN, I'M GOING TO DEFER TO LYNNE BUT IT IS COVERED IN THE REPORT AS THE REPORT GOES THROUGH THE ALLOCATION OF COSTS TO DELIV SERCES TO THE VARIOUS USES. LYNNE.
04:03:32.984: >> IT IS IN THERE. IT HAS COST BY CUSTOMER CLASS. AND I WOULD BE HAPPY TO SEND IT TO YOU.
04:03:39.757: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I PLUMBING PSPECTIVE, I HAVE DUMB TIME UNDERSTANDING IT. I UNDERSTAND THAT RESIDENTIAL HAS MORE CURB STOPS AND THE 2-INCH VERSUS 6-INCH OR WHATEVER. I WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHY I'M BEING TOLD THAT, WHEN IT'S COUNR INTUITIVEO TO ME FROM A LU PLUMBER PERSPECTIVE. WE HAVE THESE TWO RESIDENTIAL PERSPECTIVE, I ASSUME THOSE SWIMMING POOL METER, WHERE YOU HAVE A WATER ONLY METER, WHEN YOU HAVE A SWIMMING POOL IS THAT WHAT IT IS PRIMARILY.
04:04:22.400: >> OR IT COULD BE AN IRRITATION METER.
04:04:24.568: >> Councilmember Hayner:  SO IF YOU ARE A PERSON WHO DOESN'T COLLECT A L OF RAIN WAT OR USES MORE WATERING FOR IRRIGATION, WOULD IT BEHOOVE A RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMER WHO IS AN AVIS GUARDER TO PUT IN A SECOND PETER -- AVID GARDENER TO PUT IN A SECOND METER LIKE THAT?
04:04:44.422: >> IT WOULD DEPEND ON THEIR USAGE AND THEY WOULD HAVE TO DO AN ANALYSIF WHETHER THEY CROSS A BREAK POINT OR NOT. SO IF YOU WERE OBSESSED WITH IRRIGATING YOUR LAWN, WOULD YOU GO FOR THE SECOND METER? I UNDERSTAND THE COST OF THE SECOND METER AND SO ON. IT'S THE SAME BELOW IT MAKES THE HOUSE SPLIT, IT HORNS OFF TO TWO METERS AND ONE IS FOR ONEND ONE IS THE OTH?
04:05:12.316: >> THAT'S FALLLY HOW IT'S DONE, YES, BUT AGAIN, YOU HAVE TO DO YOUR OWN ANALYSIS TO SEE IF IT WILL PAY BACK FOR YOU.
04:05:21.993: >> Councilmember Hayner: OKAY. WE DON'T OFFER THAT OFFICE. WE HAVE TO FIGURE IT OUT ON OUR OWN?
04:05:31.302: >>ORRECT.
04:05:32.670: >> May Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
04:05:43.214: >> Councilmember Lumm: I WILL JUST MAKE A COUPLE OF NOTES ON THIS. FIRST THIS DOESN'T PRESUME AN ANSW. SO THE ASSUMPTION THAT THIS RAISES RATES FOR LOWER INCOME, PERHAPS, LOWER VOLUME USERS, HAD AGAIN, IT DOESN'T PRESUME AN ANSWER. THE -- THIS DOES -- IT'S LOOKING AT AT SEVERAL ALTERNATIVES ONE WAS SEASONAL PRICING AND THE OTHER WAS BASED ON PEAKING SIMILAR TO THE RESIDENTIAL STRUCTURE. IN THE PAST, WENDICATED THA THSECOND ALTERNATIVE WOULD BE MORE WORK. THE WHOLE PRICING STRUCTURE WAS BASED ON TIERING WHEN IT WAS ROLLED OUT AND THE PEAK DEMAND CONCEPT AND WHAT WE ARE LIVING WITH IS -- AND WHY I DON'T THINK IT MAKES SSE. WERE DOING IT FOR RESENTIAL AND NOT COMMERCIAL WHERE THE PEAKING IS CAPPED. THIS QUESTION ABOUT SERVICING HOUSEHOLDS, WHAT WE HAVE GOT IS A STRUCTURE WHERE THE PRICE PER GALLON FOR HIGHER VOLUME USERS, THAT INCLUDES LARGER FAMILIES, IS EIGHT TIMES HIGHER FOR THAT PRICE PER GALLON FOR THE LOW VOLUME USER, A SMALLER FAMILY LET'S SAY. AND IT'S THAT SPREAD THAT I DO NOT THINK IS REASONABLE AND WE ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS. AND THEN ALSO JUST IN TERMS OF THE COVID IMPACTS AND WHAT WE HAVE COM TO LEARN, THE -- WE WERE GIVEN A COMPARISON GIVEN THE USAGE PATTERN FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS, AND WHAT'S HAPPENED WITH THE COVID IMPACTS, RESIDENTIAL IS UP A BIT. 10% OR SO, MULTIFAMILY IS SIGNIFICANTLY 4 WHICH, OF COURSE, IS NOT SURPRISING WITH BUSINESSES AND THE UNIVERSITIES SHUT DOWN. THE -- ALSO, IT WAS THE QUESTION THAT ASKED ABOUT THE WATER ONLY. BY CUSTOMER CLASS, IF YOU COMPARE FISCAL YEAR '18 AND '19, WATER ONLY IS UP9%, JUST UNDER 2 MILLION. AND THE COMMERCIAL AND MULTIFAMILY IS DOWN 26%. RESIDENTIAL WE HAVE 25% OR 1.5 MILLION AND SO THE TOTALS ARE DOWN. THE WATER REVENUES AREOWN 7 PUN THOUSAND OR JUST UNDER 3%. SO, AGAIN, WE KNOW MORE NOW WITH THIS HISTORY AND I THINK IT'S -- IT'S HELPFUL TO TAKE ANOTHER LOOK.
04:09:13.190: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? I WILL VOTE AGAINST IT. I THINK THE WATER RATE STUD ID ID -- STUDY AND THE COST OF SERVICE STUDY, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT IT COSTS MORE TO PROVIDE WATER TO SINGLE FAMILY USERS AND THAT IROPERLY ALLOCATESSSES TO HIGH VOLUME USERS BECAUSE THE SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE BUILT IN ORDER TO DELIVER THE CAPACITY -- YOU KNOW IN ORDER TO DELIVER THE VOLUME THAT THE HIGH USERS DEMAND. IT LINKS THOSE COSTS WITH THE USERS THAT OBLIGATEHE CAPACITY. AS THE CONSULTANT THAT COUNCIL RETAINED TO SECOND GET THOSE FINDINGS CHANGING THE WATER RATE STRUCTURE WILL MEAN OF NECESSARY AN INCREASE OF WATER RAT OF COSTF GLONS, COST OF CCF RATES FOR A -- YOU KNOW -- A LARGE NUMBER OF USERS, PARTICULARLY IN THE LOW VOLUME USER CATEGORY. LOW VOLUME CATEGORY WILL BE LOWER INCOME PERSONS, PERSONS WHO DON'T HAVE AS MUCH LAND TO IRRIGATE AND SENIORS LIVING AT HOME. IT SEEMS TO ME FAIRLY SIMPLE. ALTERING THE RATES ARE GOING TO INCREASE RATES ON A LARGE NUMBER OF USERS IN A WAY THAT STRIKES ME AS IMPROPER AND INCONSISTENT WITH OUR OBLIGATION TO ALLOCATE COSTSOHE USERS WHO OBLIGATE US TO BUILD THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO PROVIDE THEM WITH THE HIGH VOLUMES OF WATER THAT THEY DEMAND. THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION. AS SO THE FEE SHIFTING AND THE ELIMINATION OF THE FEES FOR THE FEE INCREASESOR THIS CLING ANICKING THEM UP ON THE FLIP SIDE, FOR THE REASON THAT COUNCILMEMBER NELSON IDENTIFIED, I DON'T THINK THAT'S A WISE THING TO DO. WE HAVE CASH FLOW. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CASH FLOW IS MAINTAINED AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS OVER THE COURSE OF A YEAR REVENUE NEUTRAL RATE IREASES ON THE BACK END, BUT TO MY MIND, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE DON'T LIKE MAJOR JUMPS AND BUNDLING THIS ON THE BACK END WOULD CONSTITUTE A MAJOR JUMP. I THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO PAY FOR OUR WATER INFRASTRUCTURE IN A -- AN INCREMENTAL AND DISCIPLINED MANNER. THAT'S WHAT STAFFAS REMMENDED. THAT'S WHAI THINK WE SHOULD DO. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
04:12:10.300: >> Councilmember Hayner:  WITH REGARDS TO THIS TETING IT ASIDE, COULDN'T WE JUST BUFFER THE COST OF THE SYSTEM WITH $700,000 OUT OF OUR FUND BALANCE? WHY IS THERE A NEED TO DROPT ANPICK IT UP AGAIN? DON'TE HAVE THAT KIND OF FUND BALANCE THAT WE CAN BALANCE THIS SUPPOSED HIT BY SETTING THIS ASIDE? AM. I NOT UNDERSTANDING THIS CORRECTLY? MR. CRAWFORD, COULD YOU MAYBE ANSWER THAT?
04:12:44.735: >> City Admin. Crawford: YOU WILL LET MR. HUPY ANSWER.
04:12:47.070: >> I WILL START AND I WILL L MAY PRASCHAN FINISH. UNDERSTANDING THE RATE PLAN IS THE LONG-TERM PLAN. AS WE LOOK OUT OVER THE COMING YEARS AND WE LOOK AT OUR CAPITAL, PARTICULARLY BUILDING ABILITY TO PAY FOR A REPLACEMENT TREATMENT PLAN, WE -- WHY WE HAVE A FUND BALANCE AS LOCK AT THE LONG-TERM RATE PLAN SIX TO TEN YEARS, WE WILL BE USING THAT TOWARD THE CAPITAL REPLACEMENT OF THE PLAN. IF I DON'T HAVE THAT EXACTLY RIGHT,ARTY WILL JUMP IN?
04:13:34.618: >> NO, YOU HAVE THAT EXACTLY RIGHT.
04:13:37.488: >> City Admin. Crawford: SAID ANOTHER WAY, IT'S NOT A PROVISIT MAKING ENTERPRISE. SO BECAUSE THE COSTS ARE TIED UP IN PRODUCTION AND IN CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS, IF YOU USE UP THE RESERVINGS, THAT ARE PLANNED TO BE USED FOR ONE OF THOSE ITEM -- RESERVES THAT ARE PLANNED TO BE USED FOR ONE OF THOSE ITE, IT PUSHES THE COSTS EITHER SOMETHING WON'T GET DONE AND YOU CAN DEFER STUFF OR WE RAISE RATES.
04:14:13.156: >> Mayor Taylor: YOU STILL HAVE THE FLOOR.
04:14:15.559: >> Councilmember Hayne PEFUY THI WILLASS. I DON SEE THEARM IN IT.

WHEN WE WERE LOOKING AT OUR PROJECTIONS HAVE WE RECALIBRATED OUR PROJECTIONS FOR THE UPCOMING YEAR OR YEARS BASED ON WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE LAST YEAR. HOW ARE WE BASINGUR PRECTIONS GOING FORWARD? WHAT SET OF NUMBERS ARE WE USING TO MAKE THOSE PROJECTIONS WITH?
04:16:25.722: >> City Admin. Crawford: CRAIG OR MARTY, ONE OF YOU GUYS? WE WOULD USE NUMBERS FROM 2018 AND THEN INCORPORATE ANY CHANGES THAT WE KNOW MOST OF THE CHANGE WE SAW WAS DUE TO WEATHER THIS PAST YEAR, RESULTING IN LOWER USAGE SO WE WILL TAKE, LIKE I SAID, FISCAL YEAR '18'S USAGE NUMBERS AND INCORPORATE ANY CHANGES THAT WE ARE AWARE OF.

04:21:47.978: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. I WAS HOPING THAT SOMEONE ON STAFF COULD REALLY JUST HIGHLIGHT WHAT THISS SUPPOD IT'S A LITTLE BIT ABOVE SOME OF OUR PAY GRADE. SO IS SOMEONE ON STAFF AVAILABLE TO HIGHLIGHT WHAT SIGNIFICANT MATERIAL DIFFERENCES THIS IS PROPOSING TO BRING?
04:22:18.808: >> SURE, I'M HAPPY TO ADDRESS THAT. THIS IS BRETT LENART THE PLANNING MANAGER. THIS IS INTENDED TO IMPROVE SOME DUPLICATE LANGUAGE IN THE UDC. CURRENTLY WE HAVE DISTINCT SECTIONS THAT OUTLINE THE PROCEDURES FOR CONSIDERATION OF SITE PLANS AND ON THE CONTENT REIRED ON SITE PLANS. THEN ANOTHER SECTION PROVIDES THAT SAME WORK FOR AREA PLANS AND CONTENT REQUIREMENTS FOR AREA PLANS. WHEN YOU LOOK INTO THOSE SECTIONS IN THE OPPOR UTDDC, WEE TRYING TO CONSOLIDATE AND TO PROVIDE A SUMMARY CHART OR TABLE AT THE BEGINNING AT THE OUTSET THAT WILL HOPELY PROVIDE AN IMPROVED ROADMAP FOR THOSE SEEKING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE SPECIFIC COMPONENTS OF THAT PARTICULAR PLAN WOULD BE REQUIRED. IT DOESN'T PROPOSE ANY SUBSTANCE CHANGE TO THE CONTENT REQUIRED R ANY TYPES OF PLANS.
04:23:26.209: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE TO EXPLAIN THAT TO US. JUST FOR THE SAKE OF A LONGER MEETING, CAN YOU EXPLAIN MAYBE JUST GIVING US AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT THAT IS. BECAUSE WE HEAR MANY TIMES TT DEVELOPMENT IS STALLED AND ANN ARBOR IS NOT AN ATTRACTIVE PLACE TO DO BUSINESS BECAUSE THE COST OF BUSINESS IS SO GREAT IN GETTING PROJECTS APPROVED AND MOVED. I'M NOT SURE IF THAT WAS THE INTENT OF THIS OR IF THIS WAS MORE FOR INTERNAL USE AND EXPERIENCE, BUT JUST ANECDOTALLY IF YOU COULD PROVIDE US WITH AN
04:24:05.482: >> TS PROSED AMENDMENT WON'T MOVE THE REQUIREMENTS IN A SUBSTANTIVE WAY TOWARDS SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT I'M PRESUMING YOU ARE HEARING IN THAT REGARD. THAT TYPE OF UP M UNPACKING WAS CONSIDERED IN A PRIOR RESOLUTION THAT WAS TABLED BY THE BOARD TO LOOK AT TWO COMPONTS. ARE THERE SCALES OF PROJECTS THAT MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE TO LOWER THE APPROVAL THRESHOLD, THAT IS FROM CITY COUNCIL TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION, PLANNING COMMISSION TO THE STAFF LEVEL OR -- AND/OR INDEPENDENTLY CHANGE AND IMPROVE HOW WE COMMUNICATE A DIFFERENT COMPONENT OF SITE PLAN REVIEW PROCESS THATS WHAT TYP OF IMPROVEMENTS REQUIRE -- WILL MANDATE WHAT LEVEL OF APPROVAL. THIS PROPOSED AMENDMENT, WHILE I THINK IT DOES IMPROVE THE COMMUNICATION OF WHAT CONTENT IS REQUIRED, IT DOESN'T SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE THE CONTENT REQUIRED. SO I'M JUST PRESUMING THE CONTEXT OF SOMEF THOSE CONVERSATION -- COERSATIONS I DON'T THINK THAT THIS WOULD ALLEVIATE CONCERNS THAT A PROJECT HAS TO PROVIDE A VERY HIGH LEVEL OF DETAIL TO PROCEED THROUGH THE SITE PLANS. IT JUST HOPEFULLY COMMUNICATES THAT CONTENT IN A MORE CLEAR WAY.
04:25:28.531: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  AND I APOLOGIZE FOR RUNNINGON SO TSILL ALLEVIATE SE OF E ISSUES THAT WE HAVE WHEN COMMUNICATIONS BREAK DOWN AND THIS WILL MAKE IT MORE UNDERSTANDABLE FOR PEOPLE WHO APPROACH THE CITY TO DO THE TYPE OF WORK THAT THIS ENCOMPASSES, AND THAT THEY HAVE MORE INFORMATION ON THE ONSET AND THEY ARE NOT LATER ASKED TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMAON THAT TY WEREOT AWA OF TO BEGIN WITH.
04:25:57.827: >> THAT'S EXACTLY THE INTENTION TO MORE CLEARLY COMMUNICATE WHAT IS GOING TO BE REQUIRED ONCE THEY EMBARK ON THOSE PROCESSES.
04:26:06.035: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU SO MUCH.
04:26:09.339: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
04:26:10.340: >> Councilmember Bannister:  I LENART A DER DELACOURT.TSIN I HAVE RECEIVED -- SEVERAL OF US COUNCILMEMBERS HAVE BEEN TALKING TO LOCAL COMMERCIAL PROPERTY OWNERS WHO HAVE HAD TROUBLE IMPROVING THEIR PROPERTIES, MAKING MODEST IMPROVEMENTS TO THEIR COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES, BECAUSE THEY ARE TRIGGERIN THIS SITE PLAN APPROVAL PROCESS THAT GETS COVERED VERY LATELY AND EXTENSIVELY. AND SO THIS ORDINANCE AMENDMENT IS A FIRST ATTEMPT TO DO THAT, BUT WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SUGGEST STAFF, FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION AND SEVERAL LOCAL COMMERCIAL PROPERTY OWNERS HAVE VOLUNTEERED THAT THEY WOULD ENTHUSIASTICALLY SERVE ON A LITTLE TASK FORCE OR SUBCOMMITTEE MEETING TO GO OVER THIS ORDINANCE AND TRU GET DOWN TO IMPROVING THE PROCESS SO THAT LOCAL COMMERCIAL PROPERTY OWNERS CAN IMPROVE THEIR PROPERTIES AND WHAT HAPPENS IF WE DON'T HELP THEM TO DO THIS? IS THAT THEY CAN'T IMPROVE THEIR PROPERTIES. THEY COULD BE AN EYE SOREND TH -- OR FL IO DREPAIR, AND THEN IT MAKES THEM VULNERABLE FOR A LARGER PROJECT TO COME THROUGH AND DOWN THE EXISTING BUILDINGS BECAUSE THE LARGER POSSIBLY OUT-OF-STATE DEVELOPER, IF YOU WILL, YOU KNOW, CANOME IN AND AFFORD EXPENSIVE AND LENGTHY SITE PLAN PROCESS THAT JUST ISN'T WORTH IT ON SOME OF THESE MODEST COMMERCIAL PROPERTY OWNERS IN TOWN. SO I WOULD -- I'M ASKING TO SEND THIS BACK FOR REVIEW AND PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT WITH LOCAL ARCHITECT D LOCAL CIV ENGINEERS AND LOCAL DEVELOPERS AND OWNERS OF COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES WHO HAVE NOT IMPROVED THEIR PROPERTIES BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE DETAILS THEY ARE AWARE OF AND COULD HELP THEM IMPROVE SYSTEMILLY THIS PROBLEM.
04:28:52.702: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THAT A MOTION TO SEND IT BACK TO PLANNING COMMISSION, I GUESS, THEN, TO REFER IT BACK TO PLANNING?
04:28:57.407: >> Councilmember Bannister: IT DIDN'T COME THROUGH PLANNING. IT CAME STRAIGHT FROM STAFF BUT YES, TO SEND IT BACK FOR PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT AND -- AND TOMPROVE THE ACTUA ORDINANCE REIREMENTS FOR SITE PLAN REVIEW.
04:29:24.367: >> Mayor Taylor: WHERE WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEND IT?
04:29:26.502: >> Councilmember Bannister: WOULD THAT BE MR. LENART.
04:29:29.005: >> WE ALWAYS APPRECIATE THAT FEEDBACK AND I WOULD BE HAPPY TO ENGAGE WITH ANYBODY WHO IS INTERESTED. TO BE CLEAR, THIS AND ANY PROPOSED CHANGE TO THE UDC DOES GO THROUGH PLANNING COMMISSION. THIS WAS REVIEWED BY PLANNING COMMISSION AS WELL BUT IT WAS INITIATED BY MY TEAM AS A MEANS OF HOPEFULLY MORE EFFECTIVELY COMMUNICATING THE STANDARDS. IF ADDITIONAL SOR OF ANALYSIS OF THIS ORDINANCE IS DESIRED, I'M, OF COURSE, HAPPY TO UNDERTAKE THAT. IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO ME IN THE CONTEXT OF THAT DIRECTION TO GET SOME CLARITY ABOUT WHAT PERHAPS SOME OF THE GOALS MIGHT BE OF THAT.
04:30:16.052: >> Councmember Bannier:  I VE BEEN LISTENINGO A LOT OF THESE COMMERCIAL PROPERTY OWNERS AND ONE OF THEIR MAIN GOALS IS IF YOU ARE IMPROVING -- IF YOUR IMPROVEMENT WAS 10% OF THE FLOOR AREA, THAT TRIGGERS THE SITE PLAN PROCESS, BUT THAT 10% IS WHETHER YOUR PROPERTY IS 2,000 SQUARE FOOT IMPROVENT OR A 1000 SQUARE FOOT IMMOVEMENT, AND SO SINCE IT'S ALWAYS 10% THAT SKEWED IT TO MAKE IT MORE INCONVENIENT AND EXPENSIVE AND LENGTHY FOR THIS SMALLER SIZE SD PROJECT --
04:30:58.427: >> YEAH, AND I THINK THAT WAS SOMEF THE INTENTION O THE SECOND ROLUTION THA WAS CONSIDED BY COUNCIL IS TO LOOK AT THOSE THRESHOLDS TO DETERMINE IF THOSE ARE THE RIGHT NUMBERS AND IF THEY ARE LINKED WITH THE APPROPRIATE AUTHORITY TO MAKE THE DECISION ON THOSE PLANS, I ORIGIN THOUGHT I THAT REGARDHE WA TO NOT ONLY LOO ATUR STANDARDS BUT TO DO SOME BENCHMARKERS OF PEER COMMUNITIES OF WHERE THEIR THRESHOLDS ARE. HAPPY TO LOOK AT THAT, OF COURSE. I DO THINK THAT SOME OF THOSE DECISIONS COULD BE EVALUATED INDEPENDENT OF THIS AMENDMENT, WHICH IS STRICTLY SITE PLAN CONTENT, B,F COURSE, I HAPPYO RESND TO THE DIRECTION THAT COUNCIL WOULD LIKE US TO LOOK AT.
04:31:55.017: >> Mayor Taylor: I TAKE IT AS A MOTION TO SEND IT BACK TO PLANNING FOR THAT PURPOSE. I HAVE COUNCIL MEMBER HAYNER AND ACKERMAN IN THE QUEUE, IN CASE THAT FAILS.
04:32:04.927: >> Councilmember Aerman:  I NES A SECOND.
04:32:07.797: >> Clerk Budry: WAS THERE A SECOND?
04:32:09.498: >> Mayor Taylor: SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD. LET ME SUGGEST WE JUST VOTE ON THIS ONE WAY OR ANOTHER, PEOPLE HAVE HAD THEIR GENERAL IDEA. DOES ANYBODY WANT TO SAY ANYTHING ABOUT SENDING IT BACK TO PLANNING? I WILL VOTE NO. SEEING NO --
04:32:32.755: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  IF I COULD.
04:32:36.125: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER AND THEN ACKERMAN.
04:32:39.161: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I DON'T KNOW WHAT EXISTED BEFORE. I NEVER TRIED TO DEVELOP, YOU KNOW, A SITE MYSELF, AND SO THIS SEEMS SO THOROUGH, THAT I CAN ONLY IMAGINE THAT WE HAVE ALMOST MORE INFMATION THAN THEY MIGHT NE OR WANT TOAVE AND I D'T SEE HOW THAT'S A BAD THING. AND SO WHEN I SEE THIS IN FRONT OF ME, I LOOK AT THE TABLE AND THE DESCRIPTIVE ELEMENTS THAT ARE REALLY THOROUGHLY SPELLED OUT BELOW IT. I -- I THINK IT'S GREAT THAT WE'RE OFFERING TO PROVIDE THIS AMOUNT OF DETAIL TO DEVELOPERS. THEY CAN SKIM RIGHT THROUGH IT AND DECIDE WHOEVER NEEDS TO ACCOUNT O THEIREAM WHOEVER NES TO ACCNT FOR WHAT AND SO I THINK THAT AS YOU SAID MR. LENART THAT THESE ARE DIFFERENT -- DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS TO DIFFERENT PROBLEMS WE HAVE BEFORE US HERE AND I THINK THIS ONE IS A GOOD SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM OF MAYBE, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT IN THE AMOUNT OF DETAIL THE CITY WAS GOING TO ASK AND IT LOOKS LIKE THEY CAN NOW AND I WOULD JUSTUGGEST THAT WE ME IS FORWARD AND -- AND PICK UP THE OTHER RESOLUTION THAT, YOU KNOW, MAY ADDRESS SOME OF THE OTHER CONCERNS. I'M NOT SURE THAT BYPASSING COUNCIL'S APPROVAL IS THE RIGHT SOLUTSOLUTION TO THAT. I WILL PROBABLY VOTE NO FOR KICKING IT BACK. IT SEEMS PERFECTLY FINE TO M
04:33:55.938: >> Mor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
04:33:57.907: >> Councilmember Ackerman: DITTO.
04:34:02.745: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER
04:34:05.081: >> Councilmember Eaton: MR. LENA RT, THIS MERELY CLARIFIES WHAT'S ALREADY IN THE ORDINANCE; IS THAT CORRECT?
04:34:10.619: >> YEAH. BANNISTER AND I, ABOUT WHAT THE TRIGGERS A SITE PLAN PROCESS WILL BE HANDLED SEPARATELY FROM THIS?
04:34:26.102: >> YES. I WAS WAITING FOR SORT OF STAFF DIRECTION. I KNOW THAT'S BEEN A TOPIC OF PAST COUNCIL DISCUSSION. THAT'S NOT A COMPONENT OF THIS PROPOSED AMENDMENT.
04:34:38.214: >> Councilmeer Eaton: SO ULD ASK COUNCILMEMB BANNISTER TO RECONSIDER HER MOTION TO SEND THIS BACK BECAUSE I THINK IT INVOLVES A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ISSUE THAN YOU AND I ARE CONCERNED ABOUT.
04:34:50.459: >> Councilmember Bannister: OKAY. I MIGHT ASK MR. CRAWFORD TO WEIGH IN BECAUSE I KNOW HE AND I TALKED ABOUT IT OVER THE WERE THINKING TT THI WASWE MAYBE A SYSTEMIC PROBLEM THAT WE WERE LOOKING TO FIX. AND SO I DIDN'T WANT TO JUST -- I'M NOT SURE --
04:35:12.481: >> Councilmember Eaton: OKAY.
04:35:13.115: >> Councilmember Bannister: ON TRACK --
04:35:13.983: >> Councilmember Eaton: AND JUST ADDITIONALLY, THIS IS FIRST READING. WE HAVE TIME TO TALK TO BOTH MR. LENART AND MR. CRAWFORD BEFO IT COMES BK FOR SECOND READING.

04:37:30.119: >> Councilmember Hayner: SINCE THIS IS FIRST READING, I WILL BE BRIEF. THIS IS MOTIVAT BY MY DESIRE AND ALSO GENERAL -- THE PUBLIC'S DESIRE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE TYPES OF YARDS THAT WE HAVE IN OUR CITY ARE AS -- AS BENEFICIAL AS POSSIBLE, BIODIVERSE AS POSSIBLE AND SERVING THE RESIDENTS, AS WELL AS THE ECOLOGY AND WE ARE BASICALLY ADDING THE TYPES OF THINGS THAT ARE ALLOWED IN THERONT YARDS. THEY ALLOW POLLINATOR GARDEN OR RAIN GARDENING AS THE TYPES OF PLANTINGS THAT ARE ALLOWED TO EXCEED THE MINIMUM HEIGHT LIMIT. AND SO AS -- LIKE THE CURRENT ORDINANCES OUTSIDE OF THE CULTIVATED BED AND THERE WAS SOME CONCERN IS THA A CULTIVAT B. AN A LOT OF PEOPLE DO CONTAINERS WHICH IS NOT A BED. AND WE HAVE STORMWATER GARDENS. THE CITY IS USING THEIR OWN STORMWATER GARDENS AND SOME EXCELLENT EXAMPLES ARE ON MILLER. I BASICALLY TOOK A LOOK AT THE HEIGHT OF THOSE PLANTS AND REALIZED EVEN THE CITY'S PLANTS ARE IN EXCESS OF OUR CURRENT ORDINANCE AND THAT' THE KIND OF STUFF WE ARERIKING T PROMOTE AND WE ARE TRYING TO GET AWAY FROM TURF GRASS. THIS IS ANOTHER STEP OF IN THAT DIRECTION. IT DOESN'T FORCE ANYBODY TO HAVE A GIANT FLOWER GARDEN IN THEIR FRONT YARD BUT THAT'S A GENERAL TREND AMONG CITIES AND RESIDENTS TO KIND OF TAKE MATTERS INTO THEIR OWN HAND WHEN IT COMES TO ECOLOGY AND HOPEFULLY THIS WILL -- WILL ALLOW THEMO FEEL THEITY ENCOUGES THATIND OF BEHAVIOR. I WILL SAY MY OWN EXPERIENCE WITH MY RAIN GARDEN AND POLLINATOR GARDENS AND NOW MICROVEGETABLE GARDENS HAVE BEEN PRETTY AWESOME. I READ A REPORT THIS ASPECTS OF, THIS PEOPLE HAVE BEEN DOING SOME BIOLOGY SURVEYSN TIR FNT YAS AND FOLKS W HAVE A MORE DIVERSE HABITAT AND FLOWERING PLANTS AND STUFF. THEY HAVE 600, 700 SPECIES IN THEIR YARD AND THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW IT. REALLY BIODIVERSITY IS WHERE THIS COMES FROM AND I WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK MS. LARCOM, WOULD WENT THROUGH AND CLEARED UP SOME STUFF ON 7 TOAKE SEHAT TS WAS SOME CHANGES THAT DEPOSIT HAPPEN LAST TIME AND SO THAT'S AN ADMINISTRATIVE CHANGE IN 317 TO CLEAR UP THE PROPERTY LOAN EXTENSION RIGHT AWAY, THE CONVENIENCES. SO THANK YOU.
04:40:02.438: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
04:40:03.472: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I UNDERSTANDINTHIS PROPERL HERE THIS PROPOD CHANGES. WE TALK ABOUT PRIVATE PROPERTY AND THEN LAWN EXTENSIONS HAS BEEN -- HAS BEEN COST OUT, AND THE CITY RIGHT AWAY IS LEFT IN. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT LAWN EXTENSIONS ARE CITY GHT-OF-WAY;S THAT CORRECT? THERE JUST REDUNDANCY IN THE ORDINANCE PRIOR? I'M WONDERING WHY -- WHAT HAS BEEN AFFECTED WITH THAT CROSSING OUT OF LAWN EXTENSIONS.
04:40:44.313: >> Councilmember Hayner:  THAT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING. BUT PERHAPS ONE OF OUR ATTORNEY'S OFFICES COULD ANSWER AT. I MEAN,T'S ONE AND THEAME. YOU ARE RIGHT, COUNCILMAN RAMLAWI.
04:40:56.425: >> THIS IS CYSTEN LARCOM.
04:40:59.995: >> YES, AND IT IS REDUNDANT THAT IS WHY IT WAS TAKEN OUT. THE RIGHT-OF-WAY INCLUDES THE LAWN EXTENSION
04:41:14.009: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU FOR BEING AVAILABLE FOR ANSWERING THAT. I HAVE A SLIGHT CONCERN. I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S A CONCERN HEARD BY MANY WITH CROSSWALKS AND THE OBSTRUCTION THAT HIGHER VEGETATION WOULD CAUSE TO SEE PEDESTRIANS IN MIDBLOCK CROSSWALKS AND I DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEMS SUPPORTING IT. AND THAT IS A M MILD CONCERN OF MINE ABOUT THE OBSTRUCTION IT WOULD CAUSE, PERHAPS FOR THAT TYPE OF CROSSIN
04:41:59.688: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
04:42:01.089: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT WE SEND THIS TO THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION TO THAT THEY CAN TAKE A LOOK AT IT FROM THE PEDESTRIAN SAFETY ISSUE AND THIS IS ALSO CONSISTENT WITH THE OUTDOOR SAFE SOCIAL DISTANCING RESOLUTION THAT WE PASSED A MONTH AGO ON THAT RESOLUTION.ERE INCLUDED
04:42:22.811: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THAT A MOTION TO SEND IT TO TRANSPORTATION?
04:42:24.680: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I MOVE THAT WE SEND IT TO TRANSPORTATION SO THAT IT CAN BE EVALUATED FROM A PEDESTRIAN SAFETY PERSPECTIVE, AS WELL AS A DRIVER PERSPECTIVE, BECAUSE SOMETIMES IT'S A MATTER O SEEING ATHER VEHICLE AS YOU ARE GOG AROUND A CORR AND THERE'S A -- A TALL GARDEN.
04:42:45.467: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE A SECOND. SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI. DISCUSSION OF THE REFERRAL BACK. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?

04:43:05.087: >> Mayor Taylor: NO, I'M SORRY. I MISUNDERSTOOD YOUR QUESTION. IF IT'S REFERRED BACK, THEN WE DO NOT VOTE. RATHER, IF IT'S REFERRED TO TRANSPORTATION, WE DO NOT VOTE COUNCILMEMR HNER.N.
04:43:23.739: >> Cncilmember Hner: THANKS. TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION DIDN'T EXIST WHEN THESE CHANGES WERE PUT IN BUT THERE WAS AN ELIVE CONSEQUENT WHO THIS BOUNCED THROUGH. IT WASN'T TAXICAB BOARD. RELATED TO THE CONCERNS OFFOLKS CROSSWALK AND ENGINEERING AND SITELINES AND THAT'S WHY IT CONTAINS THE SHALL BE MAINTAINED SO THAT NO PART IS OBSTRUCTING OR BLOCKING THE STREET AND MUST BE TRIMMED TO THE 8-FOOT CLEARANCE AND PRIVATE PROPERTY NOT IN THE RIGHT-OF-WAY THAT'S A HAZARD FOR PEDESTRIANS AND OTHERS. I CAN' DIDN'T WANT TO DO ANYTHIG THAT WOULD INTERFERE WITH THE MOTION THAT IT'S UNSAFE IN SOME WAY AND I THINK THAT I THINK THAT IT MAINTAINS ITS SAFE STATUS BECAUSE OF THOSE PHRASES. I'M NOT SURE THAT IT NEEDS GOING OVER TO BE HONEST. PART OF THAT CAME FROM THIS. IT USED TO BE A FREE-FOR-ALL AND THEN THIS WAS SET IN THERE BECAUSE THERE WERE CONCERNED OVER PEDESTRIAN RIGHT-OF-WAYS AND SO ON. AND SO THAT'S WHERE THIS CAME FROM AND WE ARE BASICALLY JUST ADDING WHAT IS ARE ALSO CONSIDERED GARDENS. IN NO SENSE DID IT REMOVE THE NECESSITY TO MAKE TIDEWALK EARER.
04:44:51.159: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
04:44:52.461: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. I REMEMBER WHEN THIS CAME TO COUNCIL BEFORE AND AS LONG AS THAT LANGUAGE IS NOT REMOVED BY SIGHT LINES. I KNOW COUNCILMEMBER BRIERE BROUGHT THIS FORWARD. I THOUGHT IT WAS A WARD 1 SO I KNOW THAT -- MY GUESS IS IT WAS -- AND MAYBE LARCOM CAN CORRECT ME. IT WAS VETTED BUT BY THE COMMISSION FOR DISABILITY ISSUES BUT MAYBE THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL CONTEXT.
04:45:34.069: >> I'M SOR, BUT ION'T KNO
04:45:35.337: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I CAN'T REMEMBER MYSELF, BUT I REMEMBER THE CONVERSATION, COUNCILWOMAN GRAND THAT THERE WERE CONCERNS ABOUT SIGHT LINES AND THE RADIUS ON THE CORNER AND SO ON.
04:45:48.450: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
04:45:49.317: >> Councilmember Nelson:  JUST ALONG THE LINES OF WHAT COUNCILMEMBER GRAND SAID, ARE THERE CONCERNS ABOUT THE INCRSE FROM 12 TO 1 INCHES? THAT'S THE ONLY REAL DIFFERENCE IN THIS BECAUSE HE'S ALL WE ARE DOING IS TWO EXCEPTIONS. IF I HAVE A POLLINATOR GARDEN VERSUS CULTIVATED BUSHES. ARE WE JUST TALKINGBOUT THE HEIG THEN? IS THAT THE PART THAT WE THINK NEEDS REVIEWING?
04:46:20.849: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THAT IS THE PART THAT I HAVE CONCERNS WITH.
04:46:25.353: >> Councilmember Nelson: OKAY. THE 12 TO 18 --
04:46:28.123: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: IT'S A SUBSTANTIVE CHANGE. I'M SORRY TO JUMP QUEUE, MAYOR, BUT I NOTICED THAT I WAS NEXT. SO, I MEAN, I KNOW THAT WAS REVIEWED BEFORE AND APPROVED BEFORE ANDOWERE GOING TO 18 IHES WHICH IS 50% HIGHER AND I APPRECIATE COUNCILWOMAN GRISWOLD'S SUGGESTION. I WOULD FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE IF THIS WAS VETTED A LITTLE FURTHER.
04:47:02.757: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER NELSON, I THINK YOU STILL HAVE THE FLOOR.
04:47:04.960: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I'M READY TO GIVE IT UP.
04:47:08.463: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
04:47:10.298: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I JUMPED THE GUN THERE. I'M DONE.
04:47:13.568: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCIL WOMAN GRISWOLD, I SEE YOUR HAND BUT I WILL REMIND YOU THAT I'M RELIABLE BECAUSE OF PEOPLE MOVING AROUND. ACKERMAN WENT.HAND WAS UP BEFORE SO I'M GOING TO PICK YOU, BUT --
04:47:26.781: >> Councilmember Griswold:  MY APOLOGIES.
04:47:29.751: >> Mayor Taylor: I CAN'T PROMISE I WILL NEVER MAKE A MISTAKE IF YOU USE THE RAISED HAND BUT IT'S LESS LIKELY. COUNCILWOMAN GRISWOLD.
04:47:38.493: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WOULD LIKE TO AMEND MY RESOLUTION TO INCLUDE SENDING IT TOHE DISABILY COMMISSION, AS WELL AS TO THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION AND MY CONCERN IS NOT SO MUCH WITH GOING FROM 12 INCHES TO 18 INCHES. IT'S LOOKING AT WHAT IS BEING PRACTICED RIGHT NOW. FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE HURON PARKWAY MEDIAN, THE VEGETATION THERE IS ABOUT 4 FEET TALL IN AUGUST AND I D'T HAV PROBLE WITH THATECAUSE OF T WAY THE TRIMMING GOES. AND I HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THE ORDINANCE SINCE THE 1990s AND IT'S NONSPECIFIC FOR FOR WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WOULD RECOMMEND. I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT THE
04:48:27.976: >> Mayoraylor: IS THER A SECO TO THAT AMENDMENT TO THE REFERRAL? I WILL PICK SOMEBODY. RAMLAWI. I ASSUME THAT A FRIENDLY AMENDMENT TO THE REFERRAL? EXCELLENT. COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN ON THE REFERRAL TO DISABILITY AND
04:48:50.565: >> Councilmeer Ackerman: CAN YOU -- I GUESS, CAN YOU CLARIFY THE OBJECTIVES OF THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION AND THE COMMISSION ON DISABILITY ISSUES AND THEIR REVIEW OF THIS? THE SIGHT LINES DON'T SEEM PARTICULARLY THREATENING AT 18 INCHES. BUT IF I'M MISSING SOMETHING.
04:49:19.694: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILWOMAN GRISWOLD.
04:49:21.396: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WOULD LIKE THEM TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE COMPLETE DISTANCES AND I DON'T KNOW THAT 18 INCHES IS APPROPRIATE. MAYBE WE DON'T NEED TO HAVE A MEASUREMENT IF THE LANGUAGE SAFE, BED ON SOME OTHEREDSO BE CRITERIA. I KNOW THAT WE HAVE VEGETATION THAT IS BASED ON 18 INCHES RIGHT NOW, AND IT'S NOT A SAFETY CONCERN.
04:49:59.734: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. ROLL CALL VOTE.
04:50:02.437: >> Councilmember Hayner:  NO.
04:50:03.738: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES.

04:50:47.515: >> Mayor Taylor: DS-1, RESOLUTION ADOPTING THE LIVING STAFF ANN ARBOR CARBON NEUTRALITY PLAN. MOVED BY SMITH, AND SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD. BEFORE GETTING START ON THIS I GUS I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT I'M HOPEFUL THAT THIS WILL MOVE FORWARD. I THINK THAT THE DECLARATION OF THE CARBON NEUTRALITY GOAL BY 2030 WAS AN AMBITIOUS MOMENT FOR THIS COUNCIL. IT WAS AN AMBITIOUS MOMENT FOR THE COMMUNITY AND WE CHARGED AFF TO DOMETHING INCREBLE AND THEY DID THEY PRODUCED AN INCREDIBLY DETAILED AND INCREDIBLY THOUGHTFUL AND INCREDIBLY VISIONARY PLAN TO ACHIEVE CARBON NEUTRALITY BY  2030, AND IT IS OUR DUTY TO DO OUR PART TO AFFECT COMMUNITY-WIDE CARBON NEUTRATY AND THE WAY WE DO IS MOVE FORWARD WITH THE PLAN AS IT ITERATES. IT IS A PLAN PUT TOGETHER WITH AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF COMMUNITY AND STAFF EXPERTISE, AND IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO. AND I'M VERY HOPEFUL THAT WE'LL MOVE IT FORWARD. UNCILWOMAN GRISWD.
04:52:07.695: >>ouncilmember Griswold: I SENT AN AMENDMENT TO JACKIE THAT'S ACTUALLY LANGUAGE THAT DR. MISSY STULTS PREPARED EARLIER TODAY. IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE SCOPE OF THE PROJECT. IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE GOALS. IT DOESN'T CHANGE ANY OF THE STRATEGIES. IT SIMPLY CRIFIES SOME OF THE HANG SO THAT IT REMOVES INFLAMMATORY LANGUAGE THAT WAS CAUSING A LOT OF QUESTIONS. WE HEARD QUESTIONS TONIGHT ABOUT STRATEGY FOUR, FIVE, AND THERE WERE QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THIS RELATES TO THE MASTER PLAN AND SO THOSERE ADDRESS AS WELL.
04:52:56.144: >> Mayor Taylor: COULD YOU DISTRIBUTE THAT, PLEASE MS. BEAUDRY.
04:52:59.080: >> Councilmember Griswold: AND WHILE SHE'S DOING THAT, I WOULD LIKE TO THANK EVERYONE WHO HAS WORKED ON THIS AND WHILE THE LANGUAGE HASN'T CHANGED IN TWO WEEKS, THERE'S BEEN A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK THAT'S BEEN NE TRYING TO REFIND ITND BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER WOULD PROBABLY WEREN'T TALKING ABOUT IT BEFORE, EVEN THOUGH WE HAD MANY, MANY TECHNICAL ADVISORY COMMITTEES, WE NOW HAVE -- IT SEEMS LIKE HUNDREDS OF COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO WANT TO BE A PART OF THE SOLUTION, AND THIS IS GREAT.
04:53:36.618: >> Mayor Taylor: AND SO THE AMENDMENT HAS BEEN DISTRIBUTED. SHALL WE HAVE A SECOND ON THAT? SECOND BY COUNCIL NELSON. COUNCILWOMAN GRISWOLD, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR WITH RESPECT TO THE AMENDMENT. DO YOU WANT TO BRIEF IT?
04:53:52.400: >> Councilmember Griswold: NOT EECIALLY. I DON'T OW IF DR. MISSY STULTS WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A COMMENT IF SHE'S STILL HERE. BECAUSE THE LANGUAGE IS ACTUALLY HER'S.
04:54:09.984: >> EVERYONE, SORRY, I'M JUST GETTING THIS UPDATED HERE. SO IN CONVERSATIONS WITH MANY OF YOU THIS WEEK, WHAT HAS -- OR OVER THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS I THINK UNCILMEMBERS LAID THIS OUT NICELY. WE ATTEMPTED TO KIND OF TAKE A STEP BACK AND REALLY REFINE. I DON'T THINK ANYTHING IN SUBSTANCE IS CHANGING BUT REREALLY TRIED TO REFIND THE PIECES THAT THIS PARTICULAR ACTION WAS NEVER INTENDED TO USURP THE MASTER PLAN PROCESS TO MAKE THAT SUPER EXPLICIT AS OPPOSED TO BNG IMPLICI BEFORE WE ARE TR DRAWING THAT OUT. THANK YOU.
04:54:47.922: >> Mayor Taylor: I HAVE EDEN, SMITH, AND ACKERMAN ON THE MAIN MOTION. CAN I MIGRATE THAT DOWN? SO I WILL CLEAR YOU AND THEN WE'LL TALK -- O SHOOT. LET'S TALK -- WHO WISHES TO SPEAK ON THE AMENDMENT? COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN. ZACK THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I WILL SUPPORT THIS AMENDMENT, IF IT MEANS THE PASSAGE OF THE FULL PLAN. I THINKHESE CHAES ARE SOWHAT CMETIC BECAUSE THE INTENT WAS NEVER SINISTER. AND I WILL SAY IN, YOU KNOW, THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF THE THIS LAID OUT ANY POTENTIAL CHANGES TO OUR ZONING ORDINANCE IN THE YEAR 2028 AND I THINK IN THOSE NEXT YEARS YOU ARE GOING TO SEE A DRAFTING CHANGE IN POLITICAL ISSUE DISCOURSE ACROSS THE TION WITH SPECT TO H W ADDRESS CLIMATE ACTION AND THE URGENCY REQUIRED AND THAT WILL REQUIRE LAND USE. I THINK WITH OR WITHOUT IT, THESE ISSUES WILL BE COMING FORWARD AND I WILL LOOK FORWARD TO A DECADE'S TIME WHEN I CAN VE IN MY TRIPLEX IN THE BURNS PARK NEIGHBORHOOD FOR A LOWER RATE THAN YOU CAN BUY INTO IT NO
04:56:06.868: >> Mor Taylor: UNCIL MEMBER RAMLAWI?
04:56:08.002: >> Councilmeer Ramlawi: THANK YOU. AND THANK YOU DR. STULTS FOR BEING HERE AND HELPING TRY TO GET ONE VOICE TOGETHER IN ADOPTING A PLAN. IT'S BEEN A CHALLENGE BUT I THINK WEN YOU TAKE ON THIS KIND OF ENDEAVOR, IT'S ONLY TO BE EXCTED. THIS PART OF THELANAS CAUSED THE MOST CONSTERNATION AMONGST THE COMMUNITY. THERE WAS A LOT OF SCAR TISSUE AND A LOT OF SKEPTICISM AND HESITATION FOR SOME FOLKS WHEN IT -- WHEN IT TALKS ABOUT LAND USE, AND THIS PLAN SUPERSEDING ALL OTHER PLANS THAT WE GO TO ADOPT AND FOLLOW, SO. I THINKIT'S ONLY RIGHT THAT WE R TIME TO THE DEGREE THAT WE GET IT RIGHT AND WE CAN'T TAKE TOO MUCH TIME AND WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND ALL THE CONCERNS THAT WE ARE WKING WITH A SOME OF THEM IN THE COMMUNITY ARE VERY CONCERNED WITH THE BUY RIGHT PHRASE USED IN PARTS OF THIS PLAN. I BELIEVE THERE WILL BE HUNDREDS OF MORE CONVERSATIONS AS WE GO ON. I KW ALLHE ACTIONS THAT FOLLOW MANY OF THEM NEED TO COME BACK TO COUNCIL FOR APPROVAL. I APPRECIATE THAT TYPE OF ASSURANCE, BUT I ALSO WANTED TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE THE COMPLETE BUY-IN OF THE COMMUNITY AND I THINK THAT IS IMPORTANT IN ORDER FOR THIS TO BE EFFECTIVE. D I DON'T WANT TO WATER DOWN THIS PLAN, BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE SUPPORT OF THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY AS WE GO FORWARD. AND I THINK THIS IS A BIG STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION, AND THIS ALLEVIATES THE HEARTBURN THAT CAUSES SOME FOLKS AND IF WE CAN MAKE SOME SMALL CHANGES LIKE THIS, THAT THEY ARE COSMETIC, I THINK WE CAN ADVANCE OUR GOALS AT A MUCH FASTER RATE. SO I WILL JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT FOR NOW. THANK YOU.
04:58:39.053: >>ay Tlor: HAVE COUNCILMEMBER SMITH.
04:58:43.457: >> Councilmember Smith: YEAH, I WILL SUPPORT THIS BECAUSE I THINK IT'S CRITICAL TO THE ADOPTION OF THE PLAN BY THIS BODY THIS EVENING. YOU KNOW, I WOULD POINT OUT THAT -- THAT STATE LAW REQUIRES VERY FORMAL PROCESS WHEN YOU ARE AMENDING A MASTERLAN. SO THE CONRN THAT THIS SOMEHOW SUPERSEDED THE MASTER PLAN OR, YOU THOUGH, DIDN'T REQUIRE ANY RETURN TO COUNCIL TO ADJUST ZONING IS A FALSE ACCUSATION AND A LITTLE BIT OF FEAR MONGERING. I THINK IF YOU ARE LOOKING AT THE PLAN, THE MEASURE FOR SUCCESS FOR TS ELEMENT IS TO ADD 2,000 HOUSING UNITS IN TEN YEARS. I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S ON AEXCESSIVE NUMBER. IT'S CERTAINLY A VERY MODEST GOAL AND SO I THINK ONE HAS TO TEMPER SOME OF THE LANGUAGE WITH SOMEWHAT THE HOPED OUTCOME IS. BUT AGAIN, I APPRECIATE DR. STULTS AND HER TEA SUGGESTING THESE CHANGES. HAPPY TO SUPPORT THEM TO GET THIS PLAN ADOPTED THIS EVENING. THANKS.
04:59:58.199: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
04:59:59.100: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS AMENDMENT. I'M PARTICULARLY EXCITED ABOUT IT COMING DIRECTLY FROM DR. STULTS. I KNOW I HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH SHEEALLY MADE HERSELF AILABLE TO ALL OF US IN TERMS OF GIVING US THE SPACE TO -- TO RELAY THE CONCERNS THAT WE WERE HEARING FROM RESIDENTS AND I THINK WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT ABOUT THIS AMENDMENT IS THE REALITY THAT IF OUR GOAL IS TO MAKE WALKABLE COMMUNITIES, WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE PARTS OF TOWN THAT RIGHT NOW ARE MOST WALKLE HAPPEN TO BE THE MOST EXPENSE ENVIRONMENT PARTS OF TOWN AND THEY ARE TRULY THE LEAST LIKELY TO BE REDEVELOPED. AND SO SO WHEN WE ARE THINKING STRATEGICALLY ABOUT HOW TO LEGITIMATELY MAKE THIS TIME FOR WALKABLE, IT'S NOT FOURPLEXES EVERYWHERE AND ANYWHERE WHERE. IT'S THINKGBOUTHERE CAN CAN PEOPLE LIVE AND WALK WHERE THEY NEED TO GO. I LIVED IN A COUPLE OF COMMUNITIES THAT WAS VERY, VERY DENSE. WAS VERY WALKABLE AND ONE WAS NOT SO MUCH. ONE I RELIED ON A CAR TO GET TO THE GROCERY STORE. SO I GUESS I FEEL LIKE I HAVE SOME REAL WORLD EXPERIENCE IN TERMS OF HOW DENSITY DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY LEAD TO ALL OF THE WALKABLE BENEFIT THAT WE ALL LOVE. SO I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS AMENDMENT. I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE PLAN AND I JUST WANT TO THANK DR. STULTS FOR ALL THE TIME SHE PUT INTO THIS PLAN IN THE MONTHS LEADING UP TO THE SORT OF MORE NITTY-GRITTY DISCUSSION IN THE LAST MONTH. THANKS.
05:01:33.294: >> Councilmember Hayner: E THANKS, MR. MAYOR AND STILL SPEAKING TO THIS AMENDMENT. THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT THE AMENDMENT SPECIFICALLY OUTLINES AND CHANGES AND THERE'S SOME OTHER PLACES IN THE PLAN WHERE IT WOULD HAVE TO BE CARRIED THROUGH. I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS JUST AN ADMINISTRATE OF FUNCTION BUT AS AN EXAMPLE, WE HAVE --'M FLIPNG TOHEM HERE. WE ARE GIVING FUNDING THINGS AND A PRIORITIZATION SUMMARY AND CHANGING IT IN THE ONE PLAN WOULD STILL LEAVE IT IN THE PRIORITIZATION SUMMARY WHERE STRATEGY 4.5 SAYS INCREASE THE DIVERSITY OF HOUSING OF BUY RIGHT AND SO ON. I DON'T KNOW IF WE NEED TO AMEND THE AMENDMENT TO MAKE SURE IT'S GONE THROUGH, OR IF WE AREUST GOING ON GOODWILL. THERE OR OTHER PLACES IN THIS REPORT THAT THE SAME LANGUAGE IS FOLLOWED THROUGH THAT AREN'T ADDRESSED BY THIS AMENDMENT.
05:02:28.682: >> Mayor Taylor: WITH COUNCIL'S ACQUIESCENCE, WE WILL DEEM THOSE AS PICKED UP BY THESE CHANGES.
05:02:36.457: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU FOR THAT. AN T OTHER THING I WANTED TO POINT OUT, WE RECEIVED -- AGAIN, SPEAKING TO THIS ISSUE. WE HAVE A LOT OF MULTIPLES OF MESSAGES FROM THE SAME PEOPLE. THESE INCREASES IN UNITS IS GOING TO ADDRESS AFFORDABILITY COERNS. JUST IN TAKING SOME TIME TO SPEAK WITH DR. ST STULTS AND EVERYONE HAS HAS, I WANT TO TAKE THE TIME TO HAVE THE WHOLE HEARTED Q&A WITH ME AND THEN ANOTHER ONE AND LET ME SIT IN ON A FEW OTHER THINGS. I WAS TRYING TO DO MY HOMEWORK TO MAKE SUR WE HAVE TH BEST THING FOR US. AND YOU KNOW, I JUST -- WHEN WE LOOKED AT -- I LOOKED AT OTHER CITIES LIKE MINNEAPOLIS. AND, OF COURSE I'M NOT MAKING LIGHT OF WHAT HAPPENED IN MINNEAPOLIS BY REFERRING THEM BUT WE ALL KNOW THAT MINNEAPOLIS ESSENTIALLY REMOVES SINGLE FAMILY ZONING FROM THEIR CHOICES COMBAT THE SYSTEMI RACISM. AND ALSO TO INCREASE DIVERSITY OF HOUSING CHOICES AND CREATE AFFORDABILITY JUST LIKE THIS PLAN SAYS. IT'S NOT WORKING OUT FOR THEM. AND WHAT IS HAPPENING IS WHAT ONE OF THEIR CALLERS SAID THAT THE HOUSES THAT ARE GETTING CONVERTED, THE SPACES THAT ARE GETTING CONVERTED ARE SPACES IN THE LOW-AND MEDIUM ON MARK, LOWER INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS AND YOU CAN BET YOUR BUTT THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN ANN ARBOR BECAUSE DEVELOPERS ARE IN FOR THE PRO E FIT. I APPRECIATE THAT WE ARE MAKING THIS EFFORT TO STRIKE THIS OUT AND THE SUGGESTION THAT IT HAS AFFORDABILITY COMPONENT, WE WILL LET THE MARKET SORT THAT ONE THAT ITOES NOT AND WILL NOT. 1,000 UNITS IN 10 YEARS IS NOT A LOT. IT'S NOT THE NUMBER. IT'S THE HOW AND THE WHERE THAT HAS PEOPLE CONCERNED. AND, YOU KNOW, WHEN WE MADE COMMITMENTS TO 140 O WE DON'T SEEM TO BE IN ANY PANIC TO GET AT THAT RECENTLY. IF I HAD TO COME UP WITH 140 UNITS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING, AND TAKE SE FIF WHEELS AND00 HOUSE 140 PEOPLE. AND SO I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT THE NUMBERS. IT'S THE HOW. AND SO I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS AS LONG AS WE ACCEPT THE NOTION THAT IT WILL BE SCRIBED THROUGH AND CARRIED THROUGH AND CERTAINLY DR. STULTS CAN DO THAT. YOU KNOW, THIS NOTN THAT IT EXISTS THERE'S LEGITIMATE CONCERNS THAT THINGS HAPPEN OUTSIDE OF THE MASTER PLAN BECAUSE WE HAVE SEEN PROJECTS COMPLETELY AND TOTALLY IGNORE THE MASTER PLAN, COMPLETELY. I BOUGHT MY HOUSE IN A WALKABLE NEIGHBORHOOD. D GROCERY STORE IS GONE AND THE KOREAN MARKET IS GONE. NEIGHBORHOODS CHANGE, I GET IT. BUT THEY ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO CHANGE FOR THE WORSE. AND NOW I GET TO WALK FURTHER. I GET TO WALK OVER THE BRIDGE AND WALK TO KERRYTOWN IF I WANT TO AVOID AAR TO GET MISS I AGREE WITH WHAT COUNCILMEMBER NELSON SAID. WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IS STRATEGIZING AROUND WHERE THOSE SHOULD GO AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS BODY GET BEHIND THE NOTION THAT WE GOT TO PUT OUR COLLECTIVE FOOT DOWN ON SOME OF THESE PROJECTS THAT WILL TAKE UP THESE INFILL SPACES THAT COULD BE PRIORITIZED FOR TRANSITR DEVELOENT OR SO ON. WE ARE LETTING SOME GO AND IT'S JUST --
05:06:44.905: >> Mayor Taylor: I HAVE YOU ALMOST AT FOUR MINUTES, COUNCILMEMBER.
05:06:48.809: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I'M DONE. COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
05:06:50.844: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. I WOULD JUST LIKE TO OFFER AND SEE IF COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD IS OPEN TO THIS. I -- AND I APPRECIATE THAT DR. STULTS HELPED TO COME UP EXPLORING WAYS SEE A LITTLE WISHY-WASHY TO ME. IT WON'T KEEP ME FROM SUPPORTING THE OVERALL, YOU KNOW, PLAN IF THIS IS THE WILL TO CHANGE IT. I WOULD LIKE TO MAYBE OFFER IF WE COULD CHANGE THAT TO SUPPORTING POLICIES TO INCREASE HOING OPPORTUNIES WITHIN T I JUST THINKHAT H JT A LITTLE MORE TEETH. AS OPPOSED TO EXPLORING WAYS JUST DOESN'T SOUND -- THERE'S NOT REALLY ANY ACTION THERE FOR ME.
05:07:46.266: >> Couilmember Griswold: IT'S FRIENDLY.
05:07:48.469: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THAT FRIENDLY TO THE BODY.
05:07:49.937: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  CAN I SAY SOMETHING STRONGER. CAN I SAY ADOPTING?
05:08:02.316: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I DON'T THINK WE WANT TO USE THAT WORD.
05:08:04.284: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THEN I PULL IT BACK.
05:08:05.652: >> Mayor Taylor: ALL RIGHT. WE HAVE GOT -- I WILL GIVE THAT SECOND TO COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD. IS THAT FRIENDLY TO THE BODY. I'M GETTING A NO FROM COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER, IS THAT CORRECT?
05:08:22.302: >> Councilmember Bannister: THAT'S CORRECT.
05:08:26.140: >> Mayor Taylor: OKAY. SO I HAVE GRAND, AERMAN, GRIS -- OKAY. SO ON THE AMENDMENT TO THE AMENDMENT -- THE AMENDMENT TO THE AMENDMENT BEING THE DELETION OF EXPLORING WAYS WITH THE INSERTION OF SUPPORTING POLICIES. IS THAT CORRECT?
05:08:52.866: >> Councilmember Grand: YES.
05:08:53.467: >> Mayor Taylor: CAN I SUGGEST THAT WE ALL KNOW WHAT WE THINK ABOUT THAT AND WE JUST VOTE IT ON? DOES ANYBODY NEED TO SAY ANYTHING ON IT? HAYNER. THIS IS THE AMENDMENT TO THE AMENDMENT. THE AMENDMENT TO THE AMENDMENT BEING THE DELETION OF EXPLORING WAYS, THE INSERTION OF SUPPORTING POLICIES. ROLL CALL VE, STAING WITH COUNLMEMBER HAYNER.

05:11:16.710: >> Mayor Taylor: MY APOLOGY.
05:11:17.844: >> Councilmember Griswold: THE MORE GENERAL LANGUAGE INCLUDED TRANSIENT OENTED ABOUT THE PREVIOUS LANGUAGE BECAUSE IT WAS MORE SPECIFIC AND DIDN'T SEEM TO INCLUDE WITH TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT AND I AGREE WITH COUNCILMEMBER GRAND. I THINK THAT'S THE EASY WAY TO PICK UP DENSITY.
05:11:49.109: >> Mayor Taylor: ANYONE ELSE CARE TO SPEAK ON THE AMENDMENT? ROLL CALL VOTE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.

05:12:31.284: >> Mayor Taylor: WE HAVE COUNCILMEMBER EATON, SMITH AND ACKERMAN ON THE MAIN MOTION AS AMENDED. COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
05:12:43.764: >> Councilmember Eaton: THANK YOU. I DISTRIBUTED A DOCUMENT WITH A PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO THIS RESOLUTION, AND IT WOULD READ RESOLVE THAT THE ANN ARBOR CITY COUNCIL DIRECTS THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR FOR STRATEGY 4, ACTION 5, AND PAGES 78 AND 79 FROM THE A2ZEROLA TO ALLOW PLASTER MAN AND LAND USE INDEPENDENT OF THE CARBON NEUTRALITY PLAN. THE SECOND RESOLVE CLAUSE WOULD BE EXISTING ONE, BUT SLIGHTLY MODIFIED RESOLVE THAT THE ANN ARBOR CITY COUNCIL ADOPTS THE A2ZERO CARBON NEUTRALITY PLAN WITH THE EXCEPTION OF SECTION 4.5 A THE OTHER RESOLVELAUSES REMAIN ESSENTIALLY THE SAME.
05:13:37.484: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE A SECOND? SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM. COUNCILMEMBER EATON, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
05:13:45.525: >> Councilmember Eaton: I APPRECIATE THE EFFORT TO WATER DOWN THIS PARTICULAR WORTH OF THE PLAN BUT UNTIL WE HAVE GONE OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY AND DONE AN ACTUAL MASTER PLAN REVIEW AND REGARD HEARD FROM ALL SIDES ABOT OUR VISION FOR OUR TOWN SHOULD BE FOR THE NEXT 20 YEARS OR SO, I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S APPROPRIATE TO ADDRESS IT IN THIS PLAN, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THIS ASPECT OFHELAN ISROJECTED A REDUCING OUR CARBON OUTPUT BY 0.1%. IT'S AN ENORMOUS UNDERTAKING WITHLY PAYOFF. I BELIEVE WE SHOULD EXTRACT THIS FROM THE PLAN AND IF WE DID SO, I COULD ENT SUPRT THE ENTETY OF THE PLANHAT REMAINS.
05:14:44.384: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
05:14:45.285: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WILL PASS.
05:14:56.129: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER SMITH.
05:14:57.330: >> Councilmember Smith: I DON'T SEE A REASON TO REMOVE THIS. I THINK THE STRATEGS ARE NNECTED TO CREAT RESILL RESILIET NEIGHBORHOODS AND TO DO SO WITH AN EYE ON EQUITY, WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT ALL OF THESE THINGS AND TAKING PIECES OUT OF IT REMOVE THAT INTERSECSECTEDNESS. I THINK THE LANGUAGE THAT HAS BEEN CHANGED IN HE IS IMRTANT TO LEAVE IN. I THINK AS WE TALK ABOUT MIXED USE NEIGHBORHOODS, I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT THE WAY THAT WE HAVE REACTED TO COVID, HOW WE WOULD REACT TO FLOOD OR NATURAL DISASTER WHEN IT HAPPENS, WHICH IS, YOU KNOW, TAKE THE IDEA OF THE 20-MINUTE NEIGHBORHOOD WHICH IS AN IDEA THAT WAS PIONEERED BY MRICE COXN NEW ORLEANS, HE USED IN DETROIT WHILE HE WAS THERE. IT'S THE IDEA THAT YOU CAN TAKE CARE OF ALL OF YOUR BUSINESS WITHIN A 20-MINUTE WALK OF YOUR HOUSE. IT'S NOT NECESSARY MEANING THAT EVERY NEIGHBORHOOD IS GOING TO GET A, YOU KNOW, 100,000-FOOT KROGER IN IT, BUT CERTAINLY, YOU YOU WILL BE ABL TO GO TO A DENTIST AND YOU WILL BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR BUSINESS AT YOUR BANK, THAT TYPE OF STUFF, ALL WITHIN A 20 MINUTE WALK. THAT'S WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT WHEN WE LOOK AT WHAT A MIXED USE NEIGHBORHOOD IS. THERE ARE LOTS OF PARTS OF THE CITY WHERE YOU CANNOT DO THESE THINGS WITHOUT GETTING INTO YOUR CAR AND I THINK AS WE THINK ABOUT HOW TO LOWER THE NUMBER OF VEHICLE TRIPS, WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THE WAY AND THE LOCATION THAT WE HOUSE PEOPLE. SO I THINK TAKING THIS SECTION OUT IS IT DOES QUITE A BIT OF IMPACT ON THE OVERALL PLAN. I WILL NOT SUPPORT THIS.
05:16:56.883: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
05:16:59.286: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU. I STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS AMENDMENT. THIS PARTICULAR ACTION TO CHANGE TO MORE DENSITY HAS BEEN MY DIGEST CONCERN WITH THE PLAN AND I COULD NOT SUPPORT ADOPTING A PLAN THANCLUDED IT AS COUNCILMEMBER EATON NOTED, IT'S AN ACTION THAT HAS VERY MEASURABLE G8 REDUCTION IMPACT BUT POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT NEIGHBORHO AND ON THISNER OF THE ACON, IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THIS IS THE HIGHLY CONTROVERSIAL CHANGE. SO GIVEN THAT AND THE FACT THAT THE EMISSIONS BENEFIT IS SO NEGLIGIBLE, IT JUST DOES NOT MAKE SENSE THAT HE WANTS THE COMMUNITY TO ENDORSE AND BUY INTO THE PLAN. PLUS IN MY VIEW, IT DOES N NATURA BELONG INTO A CARBON NEUTRALITY PLAN AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED SEPARATELY AND INDEPENDENTLY AS PART OF THE MASTER PLAN UPDATE AND IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF ZONING AND PLANNING DISCUSSIONS. IT'S MUCH TOO IMPORTANT A QUESTION TO BE ONE OF 44 ACTIONS AS STATED BY ONE OF THE SPEAKERS TONIGHT, WHO NOTED THE DENSITY COMES WITH COST TO RESIDENTS AND THIS WAS ALSO NOTED THAT, BY ONE OF THE SPEAKERS WILL BECOME PART OF THE MASTERLAN. THAT WOULD CERTAINLY MORE THAN IMPLY AND I WOULD NOTE THAT OUR HITHISTORY DOES DEMONSTRATE THAT WHEN PLANS ARE ADOPTED, THEY BECOME REFERENCE AND FOUNDATIONAL DOCUMENTED TO STIFY THE SUPPORT OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS AND THIS WOULD APPLY TO THE PLANT USE STRATEGIES RECOMMENDATIONS AND ALL OF THIS LAND USE RECOMMENDATION STRATEGIES. AND SO I THINK THAT -- I, AGAIN, THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER EATON FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND I FULLY SUPPORTHE CHANGE. YOU MAY HAVE RECEIVED COUNCILMEMBER -- ALLUDED TO A CHANGE OF ANOTHER LAND USE-RELATED ACTION THAT I ALREADY HAVE THAT AMENDMENT. I WILL BE BRINGING THAT FORWARD AFTER THIS ONE. THANK YOU. ACKERMAN.Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER
05:19:49.522: >> Councilmember Ackermn:  I WON'T BE SUPPORTING THIS AMENDMENT. HOW YOU DISPLAY DATA MAKING A DIFFERENCE. WHEN WE LOOK AT 0.1% OF THE TOTAL MAKEUP OF OUR CARBON, IT SEEMS LIKE A SMALL SLIVER. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE FINE PRINT, IT'S 2,000 TONS OFARBON TAKEN OUTF OUR ATMOSPHERE AND THAT EQUATES TO PLANTING 2,300 TREES. 2,300 TREES WILL REMOVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF CARBON AS SIMPLY ALLOWING MORE PEOPLE TO LIVE IN OUR COMMUNITY, ALLOWING MORE PEOPLE TO BE OUR NEIGHBORS. NOT EVEN THAT MANY MORE PEOPLE. PEOPLE.000 UNITS WORTH OF THAT'SUGE DIVIDEND, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT THE PRIVATE MARKET, THE PRIVATE DEVELOPERS OF ABSORB ALL THE COSTS NOT THE TAXPAYER. SO WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE THE SAME AMOUNT OF DIFFERENCE OF 2,300 TREES AND SEND THE CHECK TO PRIVATE DEVELOPERS ALLOW OURSELVES TO GET MORE NEIGHBORS. THOSE SOUND LIKE TEE WINS TO SPK. I CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE WOP WOULDN'T WANT TO DO THIS. AND THE HOUSING THAT WE BUILD WON'T BE AFFORDABLE, I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT AS WE ARE MAKING LAND USE DECISIONS AND WE ARE MAKING URBAN PLANNING DECISIONS WHICH IS WHAT WE DO AS A BODY, WITH HE HAVE TO BE THIING BEYON WHAT IS FIRST YEAR'S RENT GOING TO BE WHAT IS THE FIRST YEAR'S SALES PRICE. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU ALL TUNED INTO THE WEBCAST I DID AROUND TRANSIT SUPPORTED DEVELOPMENT BUT YOU CAN FIND DOZENS AND DOZENS OF CLIPPINGS IN THE 1960s AS THE CHEAPT APARTMENTS BEING TOUTED AS LUXURY AND NOW THEY ARE THE CHEAPEST HOUSING WE HAVE. TO ARE MANY I KIDS, MY KIDS' KIDS, THEY WILL BE THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. I'M TOTALLY OKAY WITH THAT. IN THE MEANTIME, IF WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT WHAT THE EFFECTS OFENTRIFICATN CAN BE. LET'S STARWITH THE AFFLUENT NEIGHBORHOODS. WE SAY EQUITY IS IMPORTANT. THEY USUALLY HAVE BETTER ACCESS TO GROCERY STORES. THEY USUALLY HAVE BETTER ACCESS TO WALKING TO DOWNTOWN AND MANY OF THESE ASSOCIATES AND JOBS ASSOCIATED, YOU KNOW, THOSE ARE POSSIBILITIES BUT THEY ARE POSSIBILITY THAT WE WOULD EXPLORE IN THE MASTER PLANNING PROCESS, THROUGH ENGAGEMENT WITH THE PROJECT AND IN YEARS WHICH THIS DICTATES. AND WE WOULD CONSIDER CHANGING OUR ORDINANCE. I THINK WE GET A BUNCH EVER LENS AND SUPER STRATEGIC AND INTENTIONAL ABOUT IT. WE HAVE EIGHT YEARS WORTH OF PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT. WE HAVE DONE THROUGH THE OTH MASTERLANNING EFFORTS. SO, YOU KNOW, WE ARE -- BY PRESERVING THIS -- WE WILL HAVE MORE YEARS OF PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT.
05:22:54.173: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
05:22:55.408: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. I CLEARLY WON'T BE SUPPORTING THIS. I REALLY THOUGHT THAT THE EFFORT THAT COUILMEMBER GRISWOL BRGHT FORWARD WORKING WITH DR. STULTS WAS REALLY IN GOOD FAITH. AND I MEAN THAT AND I THANK HER FOR THAT BECAUSE I THINK IT WAS TRYING TO BRING US TO COMPROMISE AND WE HEAR A LOT IN THE COMMUNICOMMUNITY WHY THIS COUNCT WORK TOGETHER AND WHY THERE'S LACK OF TRUST. IT -- YOU KNOW, THIS REALLY ELS LE A BAIT A SWITCH TO ME. BRINGING FORWARD SOMETHING WHERE WE ALL SUPPORT A COMPROMISE AND THEN PULL THIS AND IT'S OVER MIXED USE NEIGHBORHOODS. THAT IS WHAT MOST PEOPLE IN THIS COMMUNITY WANT. AND WE HAD A PUBLIC HEARING TONIGHT THAT WE LISTED TO FOR AONG TIME A B MY COUNT, 35 TO -- SORRY  34-11, WHICH WAS -- SO IT'S A 3:1, WE HAD PEOPLE WHO WERE SUPPORTING THIS PLAN AND A LOT OF PEOPLE IN SUPPORT OF THIS PLAN ARE IN SUPPORT OF MIXED USE NEIGORHOODS, A IN SUPPORT OF SUPPORTI POLICS TT ENCOAGE DIVERSITY OF HOUSING IN OUR COMMUNITY. AND TO USE THIS AS I WILL DO IT, EXCEPT FOR THIS PART, TO ME IS JUST -- IT'S SO DISINGENUOUS AND TO -- I MEAN, DID ANYONE HEAR LIKE ANY OF THESE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WERE SPEAKING TO US TONIGHT ABOUT WHATHEY WT ANDHE COMMUNY THAT THE ACTUALLY WANT TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD TILTOLIVE IN, TO INVEST IN, TO E BACK TO? THIS IS WHAT THEY WANT. THEY WANT MIXED USE NEIGHBORHOODS. THIS IS WHAT THEY WANT TO COME BACK TO. THIS HOW THEY WANT TO THEIR COMMUNITY CHANGE FOR THE BETTER AND TO TALK ABOUT NEIGHBORHOOD EXCUSE, N TO SUPPORT A PLANSN WHEN WE HAVE SEEN WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN YOU ARE COUNTRY AND MINNEAPOLIS -- MINNEAPOLIS HAS HAD THAT CHANGE FOR A YEAR! YOU ARE NOT GOING TO SEE SUBSTANTIVE DIFFERENCES IN A YEAR. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT NEIGHBORHOOD CHARACTER, WE CAN'T TALK ABOUT IT WITHOUT RECOGNIZING THE ROOTS OF RACISM ANDED LININ AND EXCLUSIONARY PRACTICES THAT WE'RE SEEING PLAY OUT IN OUR COUNTRY RIGHT NOW. AND IF YOU WANT TO LOOK AT ALL THE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN IN THE STREETS TODAY AND THE LAST FEW DAYS THEY WANT MIXED USE NEIGHBORHOODS THAT SUPPORT EQUITY AND THEY WANT PLANS FOR EQUITYE ACTION THAT SUPPORT SO IF W CAR ABOUT THEM, WE WOULDN'T SUPPORT THIS.
05:25:41.174: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
05:25:44.811: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YOU KNOW, I WON'T LET ANY OPPORTUNITY TO POINT HYPOCRISY ON COUNCIL SLIDE BY ME. WE CAN BANG ON THE DESK ALLE WANT AND SAY WE WANT MED USE NEIGHBORHOOD BUT YOU CAN'T GO BACK AND TEAR DOWN LOWER TOWN AND GET BACK THE MIXED USE PLAN THAT THE MASTER PLAN. THEY VOTED AGAINST MIXED USE AND WALKABLE FROM MY SIDE OF TOWN. THAT'S JUST A FACT! THERE'S A VOTING RECORD TT I N POINT TO. I WAS PERFECTLY FINE WITH THE REMOVING THE BUY RIGHT ASPECTS OF THIS NOTION THAT YOU KNOW, WE CAN DO HOUSING HOWEVER WE WANT OUTSIDE THE MASTER PLAN BECAUSE IT'S A LEGITIMATE CONCERN. THE QUESTION IS WHERE DOES THIS DOCUMENT STA? ERE DS THIS DOCUMEN EXIST WITHIN THE CITY'S STRUCTURE? LAST YEAR, WHEN WE WERE GOING OVER THIS, I WAS TOLD BY OUR FORMER CITY ADMINISTRATOR THAT THIS DOCUMENT WAS GOING TO BRING FORWARD A COMPLETE REORGANIZATION OF CITY HALL THAT ALL THE DEPARTMENTS WOULD BE REORGANIZED UNDERNEATH THE OSI, THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE INTEGRAL TO OUR CITY FUNCTIONS. SO THAT SUGGESTS T ME THAT THIS DOCUMENTXISTS I IN A PLACE THAT IS OF EXTREME IMPORTANCE TO THE CITY. I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS THAT IT WILL BECOME A TOUCHSTONE FOR ANY TYPE OF THING WE WANT TO DO. WHEN I TOLD FOLKS FROM OUT OF TOWN AND TALKED ABOUT THIS FROM PEOPLE ALL OVER THE AREA, THE I MEAN, IT'S A LOCAL CONCERN AND THE ONE THING THAT JUMPED OUT TO EVERYBODY WHO READ THE PLAN. GOD, THIS IS THE BIGGEST DEVELOPER GIVEAWAY IN THE HISTORY OF THE CITY. AND SO FOR GOOD REASON PEOPLE DON'T WANT THIS IN THERE, BUT I WAS PERFECTLY HAPPENING WITH THE MUTING OF THE BUY RIGHT ASPECTS BECAUSE I DOT HE AOOD BASIIVING OVER HER ON THE RTH SIDE FOR TRUSTING THE CITY COUNCILS OF THE FUTURE OR THE PAST WILL COMMIT TO ACCEPTING AND ACTING ON THE MASTER PLAN, NO MATTER HOW SPECIFIC IT IS. YOU KNOW, I'M WILLING TO TAKE THAT CHANCE TO KEEP THIS PROJECT MOVING FORWARD AS IT IS. AND SO -- ANDO I HAVING HARD TIME PULLING THIS OUT BECAUSE I'M HAPPY WITH THE REVISED LANGUAGE. I DON'T WANT ANYBODY -- I'M NOT GOING TO -- I'M NOT GOING TO ACCEPT THIS NOTION THAT -- YOU KNOW, VOTING RECORDS SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS.
05:28:25.538: >> Mayoraylor: COUNCMEMBER SMITH.
05:28:30.109: >>ouncilmembermith: YES, Y KNOW, I HATE TO GET INTO THE WEEDS ON ALL OF THIS, BUT ADOPTING THIS PLAN DOES NOT MAKE IT PART OF OUR MASTER PLAN. IT DOES NOT SUPERSEDE THE STATE LAW THAT REQUIRES US TO GO THROUGH A VERY PRESCRIPTIVE PROCESS TO UPDATE OUR MASTER PLAN. OR TO AMEND OUR CURRENT MASTER PLAN. IT DOES NOT SUPERSEDE THE QUIREMENT THAT THE LEGISLATIVE BODY MAKE ALL ZONING DECISIONS. YOU KNOW, SO LET'S JUST STOP TALKING ABOUT THAT, BECAUSE IT'S NOT TRUE. I THINK IF WE CAN SIT DOWN AND HAVE A REAL DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT A WALKABLE MIXED USE NEIGHBORHOOD MEANS,  CAN GET A LOT FARTHER ALONG THAN BY SAYING THINGS THAT ARE FACTUALLY INCORRECT AND MAKE PEOPLE SCARED OF CHANGE. AND I THINK THIS GOES BACK TO, YOU KNOW, LOOKING AT OUR CITY, THE MOST EXPENSIVE NEIGHBORHOODS ARE WALKABLE MIXED USE NEIGHBORHOODS. THENES THAT HAVE THE LEAST WALKABILYND LEAST AMOUNT OF MIXED USE TEND TO GO THE LOWEST INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS. I THINK AS WE LOOK AT OUR -- THE EQUITY COMPONENT OF THIS CARBON NEUTRALITY PLAN, WE HAVE TO KEEP THAT IN MIND. SO THANK YOU.
05:30:02.201: >> Mayor Taylor: KHAN SOIL MEMBER EATON.
05:30:05.004: >> Councilmember Eaton: I'M NOT AGAINST MIXED USE OR WALKABLE NEIGHBORHOODS. WHAT I DON'T WANT TO DO IS TAKE DOWN SINGLE FAMILY HOUSES AND REPLACE IT WITH MULTIUNIT DWELLING BECAUSE IT'S A COMPLETE WASTE OF THE STRUCTURE THAT YOU HAVE TENOWN. BUT YOU SHOULD BE FOCUSING ON OUR HOUSING NEEDS ARE ANTIQUATED RETAIL AREAS AND THE RETAIL ENVIRONMENT IS CHANGING DRAMATICALLY AND WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT BRIARWOOD MALL AREA AND AREAS THAT HAVE RETAIL THAT WILL FAIL BECAUSE THAT'SOT H PEOPLE SHOP ANYMORE. TO DESTROY A HOUSE CREATES AN ENORMOUS CARBON FOOTPRINT BEFORE YOU EVEN START BUILDING THE NEW STRUCTURE. IF YOU ARE GOING TO REMOVE BUILDINGS SUCH AS PENNEY'S OR SEARS, WE ARE GOING TO TAKE THOSE DOWN ANYWAYSND THEN WE HAVE THE COMPLETE OPTION OF WHAT WE WANT TO BUILD IN THAT REAL ESTATE WHEN WE REPLACE THOSE STRUCTURES THAT ARE GOING TO BE TORN DOWN AT SOME POINT IN TIME IN THE NOT TOO DISTANT FUTURE. IT'S A FOLLY TO BELIEVE THAT NEIGHBORHO AND RACING IHE WITH A MULTIUNIT DWELLING WILL IN ANY WAY PRODUCE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IT'S JUST IN THE TRUE. IT'S NO THE POSSIBLE WITH THE CURRENT CONSTRUCTION COSTS. SO I THINK THAT WE'RE FING O THE 2,000 UNITS OF HOUSING IN THE WRONG LOCATIONS. WE ARE TOKING TO GET FAR MORE THAN IT THOUSAND UNITS IN THE NEXT DECADE WITHOUT IMPOSING ANYTHING ON ANY DECADE ANYWHERE IN TOWN. BUT IF THERE IS A NEIGHBORHOOD THAT WANTS TO UPZONE, THEY CAN PETITION THE CY. I MEAN, BURNS PARK NEIGHBORHOOD CAN COME TO THE CITY AND START BUILDING DUPLEXES AND QUADPLEXES ALL THEY WANT BUT THERE ARE NEIGHBORHOODS THAT WILL ACTUALLY HAVE THIS VISITED UPON THEM THAT DON'T WANT THAT. THAT WILL B SUBJECT TO REAL ESTATE SPECULATION, WOULD CAN AFFORD TO BUY HOUSES AND TEAR THEM DOWN. I THINK THIS IS UNRELATED TO THE REAL MISSION OF THE CARBON NEUTRALITY PLAN IN FRONT OF US, AND I HOPE YOU WILL SUPPORT IT.
05:32:47.967: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
05:32:48.834: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THERE'S BEEN SO MUCH DCUED I DON'T OW WHERE TO BEGIN. WHEN WE ADOPTED THE PRIOR AMENDMENT. WE WILL PROCESS ALL THE BUY RIGHT AMENDMENTS THAT'S IN THESE DOCUMENTS AND PAGES THAT ARE CALLED INTO QUESTION RIGHT NOW,
05:33:09.888: >> Mayoraylo YESCORRECT?
05:33:13.092: >> Couilmember Ramla:  SO CAN TALK AUT ALL THE BUY RIGHT LANGUAGE PRIOR TO THAT.
05:33:24.937: >> Mayor Taylor: CORRECT.
05:33:27.906: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I'M TRYING TO GET SOMEWHERE WE ARE BETTER AT NOW AND I THINK WE ARE ALL A LITTLE BIT OFF. YO KNOW, I HAVE COLLEAGUES SAYING IN A WAY THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO WAIT 50 YEARS BEFORE HOUSING BECOMES AFFORDABLE FOR THEM IF THEY DEVELOP -- HOW EXPENSIVE LUXURY HOUSING IS AND WAIT TWO GENERATIONS, AND IT WILL BOME AFFORDAB FOR YOU. I DON'T OW IF THAT'S T RIG POLICY. I HAVE ANOTHER COLLEAGUE WHO SAYS PEOPLE ARE IN THE STREETS TODAY DEMONSTRATING FOR ZONING CHANGES. THEY MARCHED RIGHT BY ME. I DIDN'T HEAR ANY OF THAT. I HEARD NO JUSTICE, NO PEACE. I HEARD HANDS UP. DON'T SHOOT. THINGS WE ARE TESTING TODAY - D WE HAVE POLICE BRUTALITY. I THINK WE NEED TO BE VERY CAREFUL. WE DON'T DISHONOR THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN PROTESTING FOR THE LAST THREE DAYS. AND WE DON'T USE THE CAUSE AND EXPLOIT WHO HAS BEEN GOING ON OVER THE LAST F DAYS OVER ZONI RIGHT NOW. AND IT REALLY DISTURBS ME. IT DISTURBS ME AND IT SHOULD DISTURB MORE THAN JUST ME. IF WE CAN KEEP THESE THINGS SEPARATE AND FOCUS ON THE TASK. I THINK THE COMMUNITY WILL BE BETTER SER. AT BEING SAID, I DO NOT SUPPORT TAKING THIS OUT. I THINK WE ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE WITH UP ZONING AND INCREASED DENSITY WITH THE LANGUAGE THAT WAS CHANGED WITH THE PRIOR AMDMENT. KNOW ITS VERY UNKOHL FOR THIBLE FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE. BUT IT'S GOING TO BE UNCOMFORTABLE FOR A LONG TIME TO COME. BECAUSE THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS BROKEN. WHETHER IT'S THE ECONOMIC SYSTEM OR HOUSING SYSTEM POLE BRUTITY, CMATE, WE HAVE A LOT OF BROKEN SYSTEMS. AND I THINK WE WOULD BE BETTER SERVED IF WE JUST NARROWED THE TO HE CUSS WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT THINGS AND QUIT CONFLATING EVERYTHING INTO CLITE ACTIO I'M SORRY ION'T HAVE ANYTHING MORE TO SAY BUT IT'S MORE DISTURBING TO ME TO HEAR PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT POLICE BRUTALITY AND THIS ZONING RIGHT NOW. SO LET'S BE HONEST. LET'S KEEP THE DISCUSSION HONEST AND ON POINT.
05:36:31.089: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM. YOU ARE MUTED.
05:36:42.634: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES. AGAIN, I THINK -- I WHOLEHEARTED AGREEITH COCILMEMBER EATON, AND PARTICULARLY THE COMMENTS HE JUST MADE, AND CLEARLY REFLECTING ON THE COMMENT FROM COUNCILMEMBER SMITH, THIS IS A LAND USE DISCUSSION. AND T -- AS PROPOSED, I ALSO THINK, YOU KNOW, -- THERE ARE SOME INCONSISTENCIES BETWEEN THIS PUSH FOR DENSITY AND THE LACK OF -- THE MAP IS SENT ABT THIS -- THE PLAN IS SILENT ABOUT THE EMBEDDED EMBODIED -- EMBEDDED, I GUESS CARBON. AND I WON'T GET INTO THE WEEDS ON ANY OF THAT, BUT IT JUST -- IT SHOWS THAT THERE ARE SOME INCONSISTENCIES AND THAT'S A GLARING ONE, I THINK. AND THESSUMPTION THAT YOU IRRELEVANT TEAR HOUSING DOWN AND MULTIPLEXES AND YOU GO TO NEIGHBORHOODS AND THIS WILL LEAD TO CREATING MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING, IT'S A MAJOR ASSUMPTION AND I -- IT'S UNCLEAR TO ME WHAT MODELS ARE -- HAVE BEEN USED TO CO TO THOSE CONCLUSIONS AND SUPPORT THOSE DECISIONS. I THINK IF YOU LOOK AROUND MOST NEIGHBORHOODS, YOU SEE WHERE THIS OCCURS THAT THE BUYERS AND THE SELLERS HAVE FLIPPED THE PROPERTY IN MANY CASES AND IN MANY CASES THE RESULT IS A MORE EXPENSIVE PIECE OF PROPERTY. I SEE ITLL -- YOU KW,ANY NEIGHBORHOODS. SO, AGAIN, IN SO MANY WAYS, THIS IS -- THIS IS AT ITS CORE A LAND USE DISCUSSION. AND WHY I THINK IT -- IT DOES NOT BELONG -- THIS SECTION DOES NOT BELONG IN THE A2ZERO PLAN.
05:38:59.471: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
05:39:03.141: >> Councilmeer Grand: THANK I WOULD LIKE TO RESPOND BECAUSE I THINK I WAS CALLED A LIAR BY ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES AND THEN ANOTHER ONE WENT AFTER MY NEIGHBORHOOD. SO I WOULD LIKE TO RESPOND TO BOTH OF THOSE. ONE, I DON'T THINK WHAT HAPPENED WAS CONFLATED. WHAT I MEANT AND I APOLOGIZE IF IT WAS NOT CLEAR, WHAT I MEANT TO SAYAS TT POLICE BRUTALIT WHICH IS A RESULT IN LARGE PART OF STRUCTURAL RACISM IS SIMILAR TO THE FACT THAT, YOU KNOW, ZONING IS ALSO RELATED TO STRUCTURAL RACISM. AND CLIMATE IS ALSO -- CLIMATE CHANGE IS ALSO RELATED TO SO IT TO PRETEND THAT CONNECTIONS DON'T EXIST, IT'S NOT MEANT TO DENIGRATE ANYTHING THAT THE PROTESTERS WERE STANDING FOR OR TO TAKE THE FOCUS OFF OF IT. IT'S JUST TO SAY THAT THESE ARE COMPLEX SYSTEMS THAT ARE INTERRELATED AND YOU CAN'T JUS TAKENE IN ISOLATION. THEYRE VERY MUCH RELATED TO OUR HISTORY OF RACISM IN OUR COUNTRY. YOU KNOW, I KNOW THAT LIVING IN BURNS PARK THAT MY NEIGHBORHOOD IS OFTEN A TARGET FOR A LOT OF DISCUSSIONS BUT I DO LIVE IN A PLACE WHERE W HE LOT OF DUPLES WITH SOME OF THE NEW DEVELOPMENT THAT HAS HAPPENED HAS BEEN MULTIFAMILIAR LeAND FOR ALMOST 40 YEARS I LIVED ACROSS THE STREET FROM A HOUSE THAT'S ALL BUT ABANDONED AND PEOPLE COME IN FOR THE REQUISITE FEW DAYS A YEAR, AND AT ONE POINT THERE WAS A HOLE IN THE ROOF AND IT'S NOT VERY WELL MAINTAIN. FOR SOMEBOD TO TEA THAT DOWN AND PUT UP A TRIPLEX OR A QUADPLEX, WELCOME NEIGHBOR HAS, PLEASE, BECAUSE I HAD NONE DIRECTLY ACROSS THE STREET FROM ME FOR 14 YEARS AND IT'S TRAGIC THAT THE VALUE OF THAT LAND KEEPS THAT FAMILY FROM -- I THINK THEY WERE ALSO TRYING TO GET IN-STATE TUITION FOR ONE O THEIRIDS F SOMETIME. SO I WANT TO ADDRESS BOTH OF THOSE BUT I ALSO WANTED TO ADDRESS SOMETHING THAT COUNCILMEMBER EATON SAID, WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS A LOT, DEFLECTION. WE DON'T WANT THIS TYPE OF HOUSING IN THIS NEIBORHOOD. WE SHUT PUTT OUT WHERE NO O LIVES, OUT BY THE BALL AND IT'S NOT AN OR. THIS IS A COMPLEX -- THESE ARE COMPLEX ISSUES, CLIMATE, HOUSING, IT'S NEVER GOING TO BE AN AN OR. IT A YES,ND. AND 20 MORE YES ANDS IF WE WANT TO CREATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IT'S HOUSING AT THE MALL AND TRANSIT, AND CHANGES IN DIFFERENT KINDS OF NEIGHBORHOODS THROUGHOUT THE CITY. THANK YOU.
05:42:15.567: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
05:42:17.302: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK Y, MR. MOR AND THANK YOU,OLLEAGUES F THE HEATED DISCUSSION. THAT'S WHAT KEEPS IT ENGAGING AT 1:00 IN THE MORNING. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM ASKED ABOUT THE MODEL THAT HELP US TO MAKE ASSUMPTIONS AND UNDERSTAND THAT IF YOU REPLACE A SINGLE FAMILY HOME WITH SLIGHTLY MORE DENSITY, DUPLEX, TRIPLEX, AND QUADPLEX. AND I AUALLY SENT THIS BODY MULTLE STUDIES, ACTUALLY, OVER SEVEN OF THEM THAT WORKED THROUGH THOSE MODELS AND ASSUMPTIONS, MULTIPLE TIMES I SENT THEM TO YOU. SO I ENCOURAGE YOU TO GO BACK AND REVIEW THOSE. THOSE WERE SENT AS AN INDEPENDENT EMAIL AND THEN ALSO AS ATTACHMENTS AND REFERENCES TO OUR CONVERSATION AROUND TRANSIT-SUPPORTED DEVELOPMENT. I MENTIONED THAT BECAUSE I THINK IT'S REAY IMPORTA TO REEMPHASIZE THAT THERE IS PRETTY MUCH UNIVERSALLY UNANIMOUS SUPPORT IN THE ACADEMIC COMMUNITY AND IN THE RESEARCH COMMUNITY. THAT INCREASING HOUSING DENSITY, EVEN BY SMALL MARGINS, SMALL INCREMENTS WILL LOWER PRICES OVER TIME. I APOLOGIZE FOR GIVING JUST ONE EXAMPLE ABOUT THAT FROM T 1960s UNTIL N, RIGHT? IT IS TOO LONG TO WAIT, 50, 40 YEARS TO SEE PRICES LOWER. SO I OFFER YOU ONE TO SHOW YOU DIVIDENDS IN THE COMMUNITY MUCH, MUCH QUICKER. AS YOU LOOK TO THE A2D2 REZONING THAT HAPPENED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 2010s WE SAW SOME NEW BUILDINGS GOING UP AND ADVERTISERSUXURY HIGHISES. ONE OF THE FIRST WAS LANDMARK ON SOUTH FOREST AND AND WHEN IT WENT UP, ITS RENTS WERE THE HIGHEST TOWN AND THEN ANOTHER COMPETING APARTMENT BUILDING WENT UP AND THEN ANOTHER, AND ANOTHER, AND IT'S ONE OF THE COMPABLE TO WRE I LIVE,Y PRETTY FAR OUT ON ON THE EAST SIDE OF TOWN ALONG WASHTENAW AVENUE. SO, I MEAN, EVEN IN JUST THAT ONE DECADE, YOU TAKE THAT MARKET AND YOU LOOK AT THE PRICE DIFFERENCES THAT HAPPENED THERE, THESE PRICES ARE LOWER. WE ARE SEEING THIS NOT ONLY IN ACADEMIC REARCH B SUPPORTED NEAReUNANLY UNANIMOUSLY THAT ITS AND HERE IN ANN ARBOR IN JUST TEN YEARS. COUNCILMEMBER EATON'S QUESTIONS WHY DON'T WE ADD DENSITY IN OUTLYING AREAS. THAT'S ACTUALLY EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED TO DEVELOP FOR COUNCIEMBER EATON MOVED TOT. TABL THAT DISCUSSION WITHOUT ANY DEBATE OR CONVERSATION. SO I'M WITH YOU. I'M WITH BOTH, COUNCILMEMBER EATON, IF YOU WANT TO BRING THAT TO THE NEIGHBOR, I WOULD LIKE TO SUPPORT THAT WITH YOU AND I'M ALL ABOUT IT. I THINK THE DIVERSITY OF TYPES OF HOUSING TO GIVE PEOPLE OPTIONS IS REALLY IMPORTANT, BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE C BUY THIS HE HAV ENOUGH MONEY AND THEY CAN BUY WHATEVER PROPERTY THEY WANT. SOME PEOPLE THESE THOSE OPTIONS PROVIDED IN A SYSTEMIC WAY, WHICH THINGS LIKE THIS HELP TO ACCOMPLISH.
05:45:26.524: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. I WILL BE VOTING AGAINST THE AMENDMENT. I APPRECIATE IT VERY MUCH, COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD'S EFFOR TO BRIDGE SOME DIFFERENCES HERE, AND DIDN'T CREATE CONTROVERSY AND COMPLICATION WHERE WE DIDN'T NEED TO HAVE THEM. I THINK THAT WAS A GOOD EFFORT. I'M GLAD WE DID IT. I THINK THAT THIS -- THIS AMENDMENT IS INCSISTENT WITH THAT. ROLL CALL, PLEASE ON COUNCILMEMBER EATON'S AMENDMENT OR PARDON ME, I DON'T WANT TO PERSONALIZE IT. ROLL CALL VOTE ON THE AMENDMENT STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
05:46:17.175: >> Councilmember Hayner:  NO.

05:46:55.613: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN MOTION.
05:46:59.217: >> Councilmember Lumm: I HAVE ANOTHER AMENDMENT. MS. BEAUDRY, COULD Y SEND IT? MAYBE YOU AEADYAVE. THERWERE TWO ZING AND LAND USE RELATED ACTIONS IN THE PLAN. WE JUST TALKED ABOUT THE FIRST AND THIS AMENDMENT IS TO ELIMINATE THE SECOND, ALTHOUGH AFTER THIS LAST VOTE, I'M NOT -- I I DON'T HOLD OUT A LOT OF HOPE THAT THIS WILL PASS. SPECIFICALLY, EYE MOVE TO REMOVE STRATEGY FOUR, ACTION 6 FROM THE PL. RESOLVED TT THE ANN ARBOR CITY -- TO DELETE STRATEGY 4, ACTION SIX TO MIXED USE NEIGHBORHOODS PAGES 80 TO 81 FROM THE A2ZERO PLAN TO ALLOW SEPARATE AND INDEPENDENT CONSIDERATION AS PART OF THE MASTER PLAN UPDATE AND CONSISTENT WITH THE REVIEW PROCESSES FOR ZONING AND LAND USE REVIONS. SO IF SOMEONE COULD SECOND THAT.
05:47:49.067: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE A SECOND? SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER EATON COUNCILMEMBER LUMM YOU STILL HAVE THE FLOOR.
05:47:58.143: >> Councilmember Lumm: IT'S DEFINED AS FOLLOWS, UPDATE ZONING TO ALLOW MIXED USES IN RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS FOR THINGS SUCH AS BAKERY, GROW HE GROCERSTORES AND BREWERIES CAN E ACCESSIBLE IN ALL OF OUR NEIGHBORHOODS. FOR THE VERY SAME REASONS AS THE PRIOR ACTION, I DON'T BELIEVE IT BELONGS IN THE A2ZERO PLAN. THE ACTION HAS NEGLIGIBLE GREEN HOUSE GAS REDUCTION IMPACT AND NEIGORHOOD CHACTER AND SOME NEIGHBORHOOD IS A GOOD IDEA AND I'M SURE THERE ARE OTHERS WHO WOULD OBJECT AND THE MAIN POINT IS THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE THAT DISCUSSION AND THAT IS PRECISELY WHY SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ACTION, THIS ACTION IS MORE APPROPRIATELY CONSIDERED SEPARATELY AND INDEPENDENTLY AS PART OF THE MASTE PLANPDATE, D IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF ZONING AND PLANNING REVISION DISCUSSIONS WHERE THERE ARE PROCESSES AND MECHANISMS TO ENCOURAGE AND ENABLE A ROBUST PUBLIC DEBATE. I HOPE YOU AGREE THAT NEITHER OF THESE LAND USE-RELATED ACTIONS, WE DID NOT SUPPORT COUNCILMEMBER EATON'S BUT THIS DOESN'T BELONG IN A PLAN AND YOU SUPPORT THIS AMENDMENT WHICH IS TO REMOVE STRATEGY FOR ACTION 6 MIXED USE NEIGHBORHOODS FOR THE PLAN. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.
05:49:36.341: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCIL NELSON.
05:49:37.475: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I WANT TO THANK COUNCILMEMBER EATON AND COUNCIL LUMM, FOR BRINGING UP THESE CONCERNS. THESE ARE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED BY MEMBERS THE COMMUNITY, EVEN THOUGH I DON'T FIND THEM KOHL PELLING I'M GLAD THAT THEY ARE BROUGHT FOR DISCUSSION. I THINK IT'S -- IT'S GOOD FOR US TO TALK THESE THINGS OUT. I WANT TO SAY THATAS ON THE LAST CONVERSATN ON THE LAST AMENDMENT, I HOPE THAT THIS DISCUSSION IS NOT TERRIBLY LONG. I THINK WE CAN PROBABLY VOTE ON THIS PRETTY QUICKLY AND GET AN ANSWER. YEAH. THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY.
05:50:16.214: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNERSON.
05:50:17.348: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I AGREE WITH WT YOU SD, UNCIL MEMBERELSON. THIS ONE RANKED 31st OUT OF 44, SOMETHING LIKE THAT? AND SO IT'S PRETTY LOW ON THE PECKING ORDER OF WHAT WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE FOCUSED ON AND I DOUBT THAT IT WILL LEAP RIGHT TO THE FORE. AS FAR AS THE MIXED USE NEIGHBORHOODS GOOD, I'M HAVING TTLE COGNITIVE DISSIDENCE. WHEN YOU SUGGESTED TO START IN BURNS PARK OR WHATEVER, I DON'T CARE WHERE WE START, BUT LIKE WHEN I THINK ABOUT AFFLUENT NEIGHBORHOODS, I THINK OF I WOODS AND THE NEWPORT NEIGHBORHOOD AND NEIGHBORHOODS LIKE THAT. NONE OF THOSE ARE WALKABLE NEIGHBORHOODS. NOBODY IS WALKING TO THE GROCERY STORE FROM ANN ARBOR HILLS. ARE YOU JANE? I MEAN, OKAY. I JUST -- I GUESS I'M HAVING A LITTLE --
05:51:11.602: >> Councilmember Lumm: IT'S A COUPLE OF BLOCKS AWAY.
05:51:13.371: >> Councilmember Hayner:  WHAT IS?
05:51:17.608: >> Councilmember Lumm: WASHTENAW AVENUE.
05:51:18.576: >> Councilmember Hayner: MAYBE I GOT IT WRONG. I NEVER CONSIDERED THOSE WALKABLE NEIGHBORHOODS. SO ALL RIGHT. --OU KW, WITH EVERYTHING, WITH PLANNING AND GONING, THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS -- AND ZONING, THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS. WE DON'T WANT A SITUATION WHERE A LOT UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CORNER OF THE CITY, LIKE THIS' A LOT UP ON THE CORNER OF PONTIAC AND DHU VARREN IS SITTING THERE WITH AN EXPIRED PUD ANDWO SWEPT UP A MADE A RITE AID. IT WOULD NOT COUNT AS A CORE OF A MIXED USE NEIGHBORHOOD FOR ME. I HOPE THAT COMMON SENSE WILL REVEIL -- OR UNCOMN SENSE, AS THE CASE MAY BE. IT'S NOT A FEAR, BUT IT'S BASED IN REALITY THAT OUR LAND USE DECISIONS AND OUR ZONING DECISIONS HAVE NOT BEEN IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE NEIGHBORHOODS. IN THE BEST INTEREST OF AFFORDABILITY AND IN THE BEST INTEREST OF CARBON NEUTRALITY, AND INDEED THEY HAVE BEEN IN THE SERVICE OF WHAT SOME MIGHT CONSIDER AYRAMID SCHEME TO RAIS PROPERTY TAXES. AND SO WE GOT TO LOOK AND MAKE SURE WHY WE ARE DOING WHAT WE ARE DOING AND SET ASIDE THE NOTION THAT WE HAVE TO CONSTANTLY INCREASE THE TAX REVENUE IN THIS TOWN. WITH VERY TO CONSTANTLY INCREASE THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR INCLUDES FUTURE RESIDENTS. THAT THANK YOU.

TAKER AND COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD, AS WELL AS DR. STULTS. I THINK THE FIRST AMENDMENT THAT YOU ALL OFFERED WITH THE CONSULTATION WITH DR. STULTS I THINK -- HOPEFULLY WILL CONVALESCE, I THINK THE LAST TWO ARE DISTRACTIONS FROM SOLIDARITY IN MOVING FORWARD. I WANT TO SINCERELY THANK THE TWO OF YOU, AS WELL AS DR. STULTS. I MEAN, LET'S PASS THIS. LET'S PASS THIS TWO YEARS AGO IN THE ABSENCE OF PASSING IT TWO YEARS AGO. PASS IT A MON AGO AND LET'S PASS IT TONIGHT. IN JUST THIS PAST YEAR, WE HAVE SPENT A LOT OF TIME DISCUSSING ISSUES AND CHALLENGES AND TACKLING THOSE ISSUES IN SOME AREAS THAT -- WITH THE RESULT OF MISSED OPPORTUNITIES OF THE PA. I TNKUR WATER INASTRUCTURE. I THINK OF THE UNDER INVESTMENT IN THAT INFRASTRUCTURE, THE UNDER INVESTMENT IN OUR SIDEWALKS, YOU THOUGH, IN THE PAST. I THINK OF -- YOU KNOW, IN THE PAST. I THINK OF IGNORING THE STRONG WATER REGULATIONS AS PLACES WERE BUILT IN PREVIOUS DECADES AND I THINK OF THE INABILITY TO BUILD SUFFICIENT HOUSING A OUR ECOMY GREW AND THE JOB BASE GREW AND WE NEED TO CATCH UP NOW. I THINK BY VOTING FOR THIS TONIGHT, BY VOTING FOR THE A2ZERO TAN, WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TEASE THE TONIGHT I THINK IT WILL DO A LOT OFIT. COUNCILS TO THE FUTURE AND GENERATIONS OF THE FUTURE AND IT'S A WONDERFUL PLAN PUT TOGETHER IN A COMPREHENSIVE THOUGHTFUL WAY WITH A LOT OF STAKEHOLDERS EXPERTS AS WELL AS RESIDENTS BECAUSE IT HAS TO BE CREATED BY BOTH. TIMEO GREAT FULL FOR THE PIECE OF WORK AND I'M SO EXCITED TO GET STARTED. THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY.
05:56:18.075: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCIL WOMEN GRISWOLD.
05:56:18.976: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WANT TO ADDRESS THE PEOPLE WHO DOESN'T SUPPORT THE PLAN OR WHO HAD MAJOR CONCERNED ABOUT THE PLAN. MANY OF TSOME OF THE PEOPLE WITE NCERNS WEREHE ONES WHO PUT IN THE MOST EFFORT AND IDENTIFIED AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT. I WANT TO SAY THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO IMPROVE THIS PLAN. IT IS A LIVING DOCUMENT. SO IF THERE ARE AREAS THAT YOU DON'T LIKE, AGAIN ADVOCATING BECAUSE IT'S ONLY GOING TO MAKE THE PLAN BETTER. THANKS.
05:56:50.841: >> Mayor Tlor:FURTHE DISCUSON. COUNLMEMBER RAMWI.
05:56:53.377: >>ouncilmember Ramlawi: THIS IS ON THE MAIN MOTION?
05:56:59.583: >> Mayor Taylor: IT IS.
05:57:00.117: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S WORK IN THIS, MY COLLEAGUES, THE CITY STAFF, THE RESIDENTS, THE NON-PROVIS PROFITS. EVERYONE WHO WAS INVOLVED IN THE LOVE PLAN. YOU KNOW, I WILL SAY THAT I SUPPORT ADOPTING IT WITH GREAT HESITATION. IT'S NOT THAT I THINK I FOUND THE ANSWER TO ALL OF OUR PRLEMS. D I JUS WANT TO REALLY THROW THAT INTO OUR DISCUSSIONS HERE BECAUSE THIS IS A LIVING DOCUMENT AS MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SPOKE ABOUT. AND IT DOESN'T DOES HAVE A LOT F ASSUMPTIONS BAKED INTO IT AND MANY OF THOSE ASSUMPTIONS AREN'T GOING TO PAN OUT IN OUR FAVOR AND WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO LOOK ATTHERHINGS AND I THINK ONE OF OUR -- ONE OF OUR COMMUNITY MEMBER YES YESTERDAY -- I WON'TL HIM BY NAME BUT I'M SURE HE WILL RECOGNIZE THE COMMENT. PLAN IN HAND TO GO BACK TO AND FALL BACK ON IF SOME OF THESE ASSUMPTIONS DON'T WORK IN OUR FAVOR. I THINK ALL THE ASSUMPTIONS, THE CHOICE AGGGATION, THECOMMUNITY UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING FROM THE FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENT, WE HAVE TO HAVE PLAN B, PLAN C, PLAN D DOWN THE LINE, BECAUSE I HIGHLY DOUBT THAT EVERYTHING WE HAVE IN THIS PLAN WILL WORK INTO OUR FAVOR. I THK IT' GIVING THE COMMUNITY FALSE HOPE. I KNOW IN TIMES LIKE THIS, WE NEED SOME HOPE. IT'S BEEN A VERY DARK YEAR. AND I JUST DON'T -- I WANT TO BE CAREFUL AND MEASURED AND RESPONSIBLE IN ADOPTING THIS PLAN AND UNDERSTANDING THAT IT HAS SOMEEVERE QUESTION MARKS. BUT THE COST OF INACTION, IN MY OPINION, AT THIS POINT, AT THIS JUNCTURE, AT THIS CRITICAL MOMENT, THE COST OF INACTION AND THE COST OF DELAYING THIS, THE COST OF TABLING IT IS FAR GREATER THANHE COST ON WORNG ON SOME OF THOSE ASSUMPTIONS AND SOME OF THOSE FAILED ASSUMPTIONS. SO THERE'S PLENTY OF WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE BY THIS COUNCIL AND SUBSEQUENT COUNCILS. AND I WILL LOOK AT THIS AS A PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT EVEN THE MOSTIVISIVE COUNCIL IN RECENT MEMORY FOR ANN ARBOR HAS BEEN ABLE TO COME AROUND AND ADOPT SOMETHING. AND I THINK THAT IS VERY SIGNIFICANT AND I THINK THAT SHOWS THE COMMUNITY HOW COMMITTED AND HOW UNITED WE ARE WHEN ITS TO TAKG ACTION IMATE CHANGE. BUT, AGAIN, I ALSO WANT TO WARN THAT THERE'S STILL A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE. THIS PLAN IS FAR FROM BEING COMPLETE.
06:00:46.644: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
06:00:48.545: >> Councilmember Eaton: I WANT TO THANK DR. STULTS AND HER STAFF FOR PREPARING THIS. IS LAST NOVBER, WE ASKED HER TO PREPARE A DRAFT PLAN BY MARCD PRODUCE THAT. CERTAINLY THIS IS AT BEST A DRAFT PLAN. IT'S GOING TO NEED A LOT OF REVISION OVER TIME. I HAVE BEEN VY IMPRESSED BY DR. STULTS' ABILITY TO REACT TO THE POINTS THAT THE COMMUNITY HAS BROUGHT TO HER ATTENTION AND MAKE SOME CORRECTIONS AND SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN EXPRESSED TO HER. I BELIEVE THAT THIS PLAN STILL HAS SOME REA SIGNIFICA PRLEMS I IT. BECAUSE IT IS A LIVING PLAN THAT SHE IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO MODIFY, I -- I FEEL COMFORTABLE THAT OVER RELIANCENASS TRANSIT AND COMMUNITY AGGREGATION IS MAY GIVE WAY TO THINGS THAT ARE MORE VIABLE. I CERTAINLY HOPE THAT WE CAN ACCOMPLISH MORE IN THE EARLY YEARS OF THIS PLAN THAN IT CURRENTLY SHOWS. MOST OF THE IMPROVEMENT IN CARBON EMISSIONS IN THE FIRST FIVE YEARS ARE ACCOMPLISHED BY I THI WE SHOULD BE DOING MUCH, MUCH MORE TO ACCOMPLISH OUR GOALS EARLIER IN THIS PROCESS, BECAUSE IF YOU E REDUCE CARBON EARLY, THE POSITIVE IMPACT COMPOUNDS OVER TIME. SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE PROJECTING ARE NOT GOING TO HAPPEN FOR SIX YEARS OR MORE, IF TH LEGISLATU CPERATES WITH US. AND WE HAVE TO HAVE THOSE PLANS READY. I THINK SHE'S READY AND WILLING TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS PLAN AND SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING IT TONIGHT.
06:03:10.587: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
06:03:11.488: >> Councilmember Lumm: I WOULD LIKE TO THANK DR. SIMULTANEOUS A ACTUALS ANDHER TEAM. REVISING THE MOST CONTENTIOUS PIECE OF THIS PLAN, AND THE ZONED NEIGHBORHOODS HAS GIVEN ME SOMEMENT COULD FOR THE BUT THAT IS NOT TO SAY I DO NOT HAVE RESERVATIONS, CONCERNS AND SUGGESTIONS. I DO. FIRST, I REALLY BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO BE SURGICAL AND FOCUSED ON HIGH LEVERAGE ITEMS. THIS SHOULD NOT BE CSIDERED AN OWL OR NOTHING PROPOSITION AS IT HAS BEEN PRESENTED. THE PRIORITIZATION THAT COUNCIL REQUESTED, IT DEMONSTRATED THAT THE COST VARIED WILDLY. AND IN DECISIONS ON WHAT ACTIONS TO PURE A WHEN. I BELIEVE WE SHOULD NOT MAKE ANY STRATEGIC COMMITMENTS UNTIL WE FULLLY UNDERSTAND THE UNIVERSITY'S PLAN AND THE MOST RECENT, YOU KNOW, UPDATE WAS FROM DEPARTMENT OF 2019 FROM THE PRESIDENT'S TEAM ON CARBON NEUTRALITY. AND, AGAIN, TY'RE GOING TOTE NEXT PROVIDE A REPORT THE END OF THIS DECEMBER OR EARLY NEXT YEAR. THERE'S SO MANY INCONSISTENCIES WITH THE PATH THAT WE ARE RECOMMENDING AND I CAN PULL OUT ION'T DO IT NOW, BUT THERE ARE THESE INCONSISTENCIES AND THESE PLANS NEED TO BE INTERRELATED BECAUSE SO MANY OF THE ASSUMPTIONS ARE DEPENDENT ON EACH OTHER. WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT PLAN AND THE TENT OF THE ADVERSE COVID-RELATED FINANCIAL IMPACTS ON THE CIT A THATOULD CERTNLY INCLUDE BARROWING ANY MONEY. I REMAIN CONCERNED THAT THE FUNDING PLAN IS NOT REALISTIC. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS FINANCIALLY CHALLENGED AND IT'S NOT LIKELY THAT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONSF DOLLARS -- THAT'S WHAT WARE TALKING ABOUT HERE -- ARE GOING TO MAGICALLY APPEAR FROM THEM. THE REASON I BRING THIS UP IS TO PROVIDE A SENSE OF REALISM TO ALL OF US AND TO TEMPER EXPECTATIONS IN THE COMMUNITY. EVERYONE SNEEDS TO REMEMBER THE CITY IS FACING FINANCIAL CHALLENGES ITSELF TO THE NOTION AT WE CAN SIMPLY  AND THIS WHAT IS STATED TO US TO REPRIORITIZE THE BUDGET, THAT'S NOT REALISTIC OR LIKELY EITHER. THE CITY HAS MANY PRIORITIES. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT OSI PARTICIPATES IN ANY COST SAVINGS AND THE BALANCE OF ALL THE OTHER CITY DEPARTMENTS ARE REQUID T IMPLEMT. I'MONFIDENT DR. STULTS WILL DO THAT. BUT THERE WILL BE PRESSURE TO DO OTHERWISE. I'M ALSO CONFIDENT MR. CRAWFORD WILL MANAGE THE RECOVERY EFFECTIVELY AND CONSISTENTLY WITH THE GUIDANCE COUNCIL PROVIDED, WHICH YOU WILL RECALL INCLUDED THE NOTION OF SHARED SACRIFICE. ANY WAY, WITH THOSE CONCERNS AND SUGGESTIONSOTED A WIT THE UNDERSTANDIN THAT ANY SCIFIC NEW SPENDING COMMITMENTS WILL BE APPROVED BY CITY COUNCIL, I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE RESOLUTION. THANK YOU FOR LISTENING.
06:06:52.276: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
06:06:54.511: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. I JUST WANTED TO TAKE A MINUTE TO THANK DR. STULTS AND HER TEAM. I WOULD PUT OUR LITTLE SUSTAINABILI AND INNATION OFFICE AGAINST ANY MIDSIZED CITY IF NOT LARGER SUSTAINABLE AND INNOVATION OFFICE IN THE COUNTRY. WE HAVE PEOPLE AROUND, YOU KNOW -- PEOPLE AROUND THE COUNTRY HAVE TAKEN NOTICE ABOUT WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO. FROM SOMHAT WEILL B MOVINGONS FORWD. AND I WANT TO THANK ALL THE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WOULD EMAILED US IN SUPPORT OF THIS PLAN. MANY OF WHOM HAD NEVER EMAILED A COUNCILMEMBER. SOME OF WHOM WERE, YOU KNOW, 10, 11, 12 YEARS OLD. AND SO I WANT T ANOWLEDGE THAT AND ENCRAGE ALLFOU WH DID ENCOURAGE US TO PUSH FORWARD WITH THIS PLAN TO PLEASE KEEP THE PRESSURE ON. GIVE US YOUR FEEDBACK. THERE WILL BE LOTS OF OPPORTUNITY FOR COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT IN THE FUTURE. PLEASE CONTINUE TO GIVE US YOUR IDEAS ANDAADCATE TO IT. WE WILL NOT GET CLOSE TO CARBON NEUTRALITY BY 2030, WITHOUT THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY KEEPING OUR FEET TO THE FIRE. AND I WOULD LIKE TO THANK STAFF OUTSIDE OF SUSTAINABILITY FOR BUYING INTO THIS NEW ETHOS THAT WE AT THE CITY AND UNDERSTANDING HOW IT ALIGNS WITHHE VALUEOF THE COMMUNITY AND WLINGNESS, REAL ACROSS THE ORGANIZATION TO MAKE CHANGE. I WANTED TO RECOGNIZE THAT AS WELL.
06:08:43.587: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
06:08:44.454: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES, THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. SO THIS DECLAIRATION OF A CLIMATE EMERGEN, -- DEARATION OF A CLIMATE EMERGENCY. IT'S CLEAR THAT THE GLOBAL CLIMATE IS IN AN EMERGENCY. AND THE INPUTS ARE ALREADY IN THE SYSTEM. I WON'T SPEAK FOR DR. STULTS BUT I SUGGEST SHE WOULD AGREE THAT WHAT WE ARE REALLY TRYING TO DO HERE WITH THIS PLAN IS MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE THAT ARE ALREADY GOING TO HAPPEN WITH OR WITHOUT US. AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO REDUCE THE DOWNGOING EFFECTS AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS IT WAS SO EASY TO DECLARE A CLIMATE EMERGENCY BECAUSE THOSE -- THE MITIGATION OF THOSE EFFECTS WILL BE CRITICAL AND I HOPE THAT IS RECOGNIZED THAT THE RESILIENCE IS A BIG EFFORT THAT HAS TO BE T FORWARDERE, BAUSE IT'S GOING TO HAPPE WH O WITHOUT THIS PLAN. YOU KNOW, THAT NOT'S TO DISPEL ANY HOPE THAT WE HAVE IN THE COMMUNITY. WE ARE DOING BEST WE CAN. SINCE WE ARE TALKING TO THE GENERAL MOTION, I WILL RUN THROUGH MY LIST HERE. SO TYPICALLY I WOULDN'T ASK US COMMIS A COMMUNITY, A LARGER COMMUNITY OR A NATION EVEN BECAUSE SOME OF THAT FUNDING IS PREDICATED ON OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY, $1 BILLION TO A PROJECT LIKE THIS WITHOUT AGREEMENTS FOR THOSE WHO WILL BE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE WASHTENAW COUN AD. AND THE U OF M BETTER GET ON BOARD WITH THIS BECAUSE WE HAVE IN MANY WAYS HAVE BEEN SUFFERING FROM THE EFFECTS THEY HAD ON OUR HOUSING MARKET WITH THEIR INCREASES IN JOBS AND RESIDENTS AND THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR SOME OF THAT, JUST AS SURELY AS THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COMMUTER TRAFFIC. AND SO WHEN I AUME WE ARE GOIN TO PASS TS,HE UF M, HEAR US LOUD AND CLEAR THAT YOU ARE PART OF THIS PLAN AND I WOULD NOT COMMIT US TO $1 BILLION TYPICALLY WITHOUT A WRITTEN. AND I'M COUNTING ON THOSE TO HELP US UTILIZING IN THIS IT'S VERY NECESSARY. $1 BILLION, $275,000 A DAY FOR TEN YEARS IS WHAT WE WILL BE SPENDING ON THIS AS A COMMUNITY. SO I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT I LIKE SOME PARTS OF THE PLAN. SOME PARTS I DON'T THINK ARE EMPHASIZED AS MUCH. I HOPE IT COMES AROUND WHEN THE ACUNTING- THE WAYS THAT WE COUNT CARBON ARE ALLOWED TO BE SHARED WITH ALL THE COMMUNITIES WHEN THOSE -- AND DR. STULTS, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M REFERRING TO HERE. WE TALKED ABOUT NATURAL CAPITAL. I WISH THERE WAS MORE CONSIDERATION OF NATURAL CAPITAL AND MORE CONSIDERATION THE STORMWATER MANAGEMENT EGREERIAN REFORMS AND HISTORIL PRESERTION AND LIS OF POLICY WOULD BE USEFUL FOR US. I THINK THAT WOULD BE MOST USEFUL TO MITIGATE AND DEFINE WHAT WE ARE SUPPOSED TO DO HELP ANSWER SOME OF  OF THOSE QUEION. ANODY CAN WRITE SOMEBOD SE'S CHECK FOR A BILLION DOLLARS BUT TO CRAFT THE POLICY IS IMPORTANT, AND THAT'S BEEN MY CONVERSATION WITH OSI GOING BACK A WAYS THAT I HOPE THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I CAN HELP BRING FORWARD. I HOPE THAT THIS IS SCALED APPROPRIATELY, THESE SOLUTIONS ARE SCALED APPROPRIATELY FOR A CITY OF OUR SIZE AND ALSO THAT THESE SOLUTIONS COMPA APPROPRIELY TO THE OER C CITIES GOING AT THIS. AND SO WITH THAT, I AM GOING TO ACCEPT THE NOTION THAT EVERYONE KEEPS CALLING THIS A LIVING DOCUMENT AND I'M GOING TO PUSH TO HAVE THOSE THINGS ADDED ALONG WITH THE PR COMPONENT THAT WE TALKED ABOUT, BECAUSE IT'S ONE THING TO SAY THAT OTHER COMMUNITIES NOTICE WHAT IS GOING ON AND IT'S ANOTHER THING TO TELLHEHAT'S GOINGN. I THINK IT'SMPORTANT TT WE SHIFT SOME OF OUR PR EFFORTS AS A CITY TO HIGHLIGHTING THE GOOD WE HAVE ALREADY DONE FOR THIS PLAN, PURCHASE OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND THE SOLAR PROJECTS SO ON AND SO ON, THAT ALL OF THAT MAKES NATIONAL AND WORLD NEWS. SAY HERE'S OUR PLAN. HERE'S WHERE WE ARE MOVING FORWARD AND THAT WE SEE THAT IT'S MOVING FORWARD AND WE ARE UT THOSE RESULTSND MY HOPEN IS THAT WE GET GOOD RESULTS WITH THIS. SO I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS VOTES.
06:13:32.308: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER.
06:13:32.976: >> Councilmember Hayner: THERE'S A LOT OF RISKS. WE ALRDYLAY THE NEXT YEAR'S WORT WHY NOT THE NEXT YEAR OR TEN?
06:13:40.150: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN MOTION? I GUESS I WANT TO ECHO WHAT HAS BEEN SAID, THE DATE WITH RESPECT TO MY THANKS TO STAFF, OF COURSE. YOU KNOW, DR. STUS AND EVERYBODY TH WORKS WITH HER AT OSI, YOU KNOW, I ALSO -- WITH RESPECT TO STAFF INPUT AND ENGAGEMENT, WOULD LIKE TO THANK FORMER ADMINISTRATOR LAZARUS WHO WAS VERY COMMITTED TO THIS PLAN. VERY COMMITTED TO ITS SUCCESS AND I CAREF AND DILIGENT NATURE. I WANT TO EXTEND SOME THANKS TO HIM AS WELL. WITHOUT THE WORK HE WAS LEADING, WE WOULDN'T BE HERE WITHOUT A SUCCESSFUL VISIONARY PLAN THAT IS A REAL ROADMAP FOR US TO GET TO CARBON NEUTRALITY WHICH IS A PLACE WHERE WE ALL NEED TO GO AND WANT TO GO. I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, THE MANY MBERSHE COMNITY WHO HAVE GAGED WITH US AS ELECTEDS BUT REALLY MORE IMPORTANTLY, WITH DR. STULTS AND HER TEAM IN VARIOUS WORKING GROUPS, WHETHER IT'S AS COMMUNITY PARTNERS OR TECHNICAL ADVISORS. YOU KNOW, THIS IS REALLY A IT'S THE EFFORT OF MANY AND IT'S SHOWS IN ITS BREADTH AND DEPTH AND THE QUALITY FROM BEGINNING TO END. SO IT'S MANY COUNCILMEMBERS OBSERVED, THIS IS A START, BUT IT'S AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT ONE TAKE THI STEP.E ARE GOIO FURTHER DISCUSSION. ROLL CALL VOTE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.

06:16:26.449: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANKS, MR. MAYOR. MY QUESTIONS MOSTL REVOLVE AROUNDHE MAP, AND I SEE ON THE MAP -- THE RESOLUTION SPECIFICALLY POINTS OUT THESE STREETS. I GOT CONTACTED -- I DON'T KNOW IF THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THE PAPER ABOUT THIS OR WHAT, BUT I CONTACTED BY A LOT OF BUSINESSES AROUND THATONFLUENCE OF LIBERTY, STATE AND MAYNARD, WHICH YOU WOULD CALL THE FOURTH LITTLE SEGMENT, AND THEY CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT IS GOING ON WITH MAYNARD AND HOW WE WILL CLOSE MAYNARD STREET BECAUSE WE ALREADY CUT OFF ACCESS TO SOME OF THE BUSINESSES ALONG WILLIAM FOR THEIR PICKUP SVICE, THEIR ONCE MAYNARD IS CLOSED, THOSE PLACES AND STATE AND LIBERTY, THOSE PLACES ARE ISOLATED FOR THOSE PERIODS. AND SO MAYNARD STOOD OUT AS ONE THEY ARE ASKING FOR PERMANENT CLOSURE ON. I DO NOT SUPPORT THAT NOTION THAT MAYNARD SHOULD BE PERMANENTLY CLOD. T ONLY I IT ACCESS TO THE STRUCTUREUT VARIOUS SERVICE VALLEYS AND RIGHT-OF-WAYS AND COMMERCIAL PARKING AND LOADING ZONES AND SO ON. SO I'M NOT -- I DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT CAME FROM, BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING PLEASE NO. AND I GUESS JUST THE OTHER THING I WILL THROW OUT THERE IS THAT A LOT OF THESE RESTAURANTS LIKE O LIBEY AND I KNOW CPLE OF OTHERS, THEY HAVE MADE IT TRANSITION DURING THIS PANDEMIC TO SUPPORT THEIR BUSINESSES TO DO CARRY OUT ONLY AND BY CLOSING THESE STREETS, IN FRONT OF THEM THAT'SOING TO GO AY. WHER DO PEOPLE GET THEIR TAKEOUT FOOD AND GO AWAY. I WANT TO EXPRESS MY CONCERNS THAT FOR ALL THAT WE MIGHT BE HELPING THE BYES FOR THIS AND WE ARE ALSO GOING TO BE HURTING ISG SOME. BY THE STREET CSINGS.VERY HURT I RECOGZE THE GOOD AND WHE IT CAME FROM, BUT IT ALSO -- IT'S VERY SPECIFIC THAT PEOPLE SAY, PLEASE, NO. THANK YOU.
06:18:52.462: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
06:19:00.036: >> Councilmember Bannister:  I RECEIVED REQUESTS FOR WHEREE LL HAVE HANDICAP PARKING ACCE DURING THE STREET CLOSURES. HAS THERE BEEN ANY SPECIFIC PROVISIONS MADE FOR THE HANDICAPPED PARKING?
06:19:16.052: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. CRAWFORD BEING, IKNOW I RAISED THIS QUESH YOU THE OTHER DAY?
06:19:22.191: >> City Admin. Crawford: YES, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE MARA THOMPSON AVAILABLE TO BRI I MS. BEAUY, BUT IF NOT, YES, IT'S -- WE BROUGHT IT UP IN THE CONVERSATION. I DON'T THINK THEY HAVE IDENTIFIED THE SPECIFIC SPOTS AT THIS POINT. THEY ARE LOOKING AT WHAT THE APPROVAL PROCESS CAN BE TO DO THAT AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE. THEY ARE LOOKING AT SETTING UP THE APPROVAL PROCESS.
06:19:51.988: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
06:19:53.523: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANKS, MR. MAYOR. I WOULD LIKE TO OFFER COMMENTS, I WOULD JUST THAT SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW, COUNCI COUNCILMEMBER I AND I SERVE ON THE DDA PARTNERSHIPS COMMITTEE. I STARTEDISCUSSING THI A AT FOR AND TN THAT EVOLVED INTO OTHER MEETINGS WITH ALL OF THE -- THAT WILL HOPEFULLY COORDINATED BY THE CITY, BY MR. CRAWFORD AND MS. POLLAY AND HER TEAM, WITH ALL THE FOUR BUSINESS ASSOCIATES AND SO THE PROPOSALS BEFORE EVERYEERE DRAFTED WITH INPUT FROM ALL THE ORGANIZATIONS. I SEE MS. THOMPSON HERE. SHE CAN EXPLAIN THE PROCESS. SHE FACILITATED A LOT OF THIS. THANK YOU, MAHR A. AND THE GENERAL IDEA IS TO -- THAT MR. FOURNIER, AS WELL, WHO WAS VERY HELPFUL, THANK YOU. HE'S JOINING US AND HE CAN ALSO SPEAK TO. THIS I SHOULD JUST TURN THIS OVER TO THEM. THE PLAN, THOUGH, AS PRESENTED IS -- IT RECOGNIZES ALL THE UNIQUE NEEDS AND THEY THE VERY SPECIFIC ASPECTS, IT'S TO ALLOW FOR THE ABILITY FOR STAFF TO WORK WITH THE DOWNTOWN, TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS AS NEEDED GOING FORWARD. THE ANY CLOSURE WILL RUIRE A PERMIT, WHICH WILL TAKE -- WHICH WILL THEN DEAL WITH THE POLICE AND FIRE, HEALTH AND SAFETY, ADA ON AND ON AND ON.RBSIDE PICKUP, THE FIRE CHIEF WAS INVOLVED IN THESE CONVERSATIONS, YOU KNOW, THEY NEED TO KNOW WHERE ALL THE HYDRANTS WERE LOCATED. THIS GOT PRETTY COMPLICATED. AND I DO APPRECIATE STAFF'S ASSISTANCE WITH MANAGING THAT. THE -- WHY DON'T YOU CHIME IN, EITHER MS. THOMPSON OR MR. FORNIER, BECAUSE WE ARE GETTING SOME INDIVIDUAL, YOU KNOW, EMAILS FROM BUSINESSES SAYING, YOU KNOW, WHY CLOSE MAYNARD? I CAN'T HAVE CURBSIDE PICKUP TO MY RESTAURANT ON STATE STREE% SOMEAY, YOU KNOW, CLOSING IT FRIDAY THROUGH SUNDAY ISN'T ENOUGH. WE WENT WEDNESDAY TO SUNDAY, ON AND ON. I WILL JUST SAY THAT ALL THE DOWNTOWN BUSINESS ASSOCIATIONS REACHED OUT TO THEIR MEMBERS, AND THEY HAD THEM VOTE ON THESE PROPOSS. TH TOOK THAT FEEDBK INTO ACCOUNT. WE HRD FROM RTAURANT WHO IS CONCERNED ABOUT -- AND TONIGHT TOO.
06:23:08.718: >> Mayor Taylor: YOU ARE AT THREE MINUTES.
06:23:10.453: >> Councilmember Lumm: SAY, SORRY.
06:23:11.420: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
06:23:13.256: >> Councilmember Lumm: AND THEY TOOK THAT INTO CONSIDERATION. SO I WOULD JUST LIKE TO TURN THIS OVER TO MS. FORNIER OR MS. THOMPSON TO SPEAK TO THE CONCERNS RAISED BY COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER AND OTHERS.
06:23:24.166: >> Mayor Tlor: I HAVE UNCILMEMBER RAAWI IN THE QUE. DO YOU HAVE ANY OBJECTION TO THAT, COUNCILMEMBER?
06:23:32.074: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  NO.
06:23:37.013: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. FORNIER.
06:23:37.647: >> FIRST OF ALL, COUNCILMEMBER LUMM GAVE AN EXCELLENT SUMMARY. WE ARE ASKING FOR PREEMPTE PERMISSION TO CLOSE STREETS DOWN. THE VOTE TODAY ISN'T IN ITSELF A CLOSURE OF THE STREETS. IT IS ESSENTIALLY PERMISSION TO ARE STAFF TO MOVE FORWARD AND CONTINUE THE PLANNING PROCESS WITH BUSINESSES DOWNTOWN AND ENGAGE IN THE INTENT OF RIGOROUS PLANNING THAT WE GENERAL UNDEAKE WHEN I COMES TO STREET CLOSURES IN THE DOWNTOWN DISTRICT, WORKING WITH POLICE, AND WORKING WITH FIRE AND WORKING WITH BUSINESSES, OF COURSE, TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT E DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO SUPPORT A HEALTHY BUSINESS CLIMATE IN OUR DOWNTOWN DURING THE PANDEMIC AND MOVING THROUGH THE SUMMER. AND I WILL ASK MAURA THOMPSO TO SPK A LITE A WELL. SHE -- I APPRECIATION THE RECOGNITION BUT THE REAL THANKS GOES TO MAURA THOMPSON AND SUSAN POLLAY AND MANY OTHERS WHO WERE INVOLVED IN WORKING WITH MERCHANTS AND DOING THE REAL LEG WORK TO PULL THIS PROPOSAL TOGETHER. MAURA?
06:24:51.721: >> I WOU POINT OUTHATHE MAP YOU S AS AN ATTACHMENT TO THE RESOLUTION IS BASICALLY THE STREETS THAT THE AREA ASSOCIATIONS MAY WANT TO CLOSE. SO I THINK YOU ARE NOT GOING TO SEE THAT ENTIRE FOOTPRINT CLOSED, THAT WE SORT OF WANTED TO GIVE THEM THE FLEXIBILITY AND TO GET THIS SET SO WE DON'T HAV TO COME BK TOOUNCIL FOR ANOTR RESOLUTION TO CLOSE ADDITIONAL STREETS. SO THAT FOOTPRINT ARE THE STREETS THAT THEY MAY WANT TO CLOSE. THEY WILL NOT START WITH ALL OF THOSE STREETS. SPECIFICALLY TO COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER. THE STATE STREET DISTRICT TALKED EXTENSIVELY WITHHEIR MEMBERSHIP A IT'S A PORTI OF MAYNARD THAT THEY ARE LOOKING TO CLOSE FROM I THINK JUST NORTH OF THE PARKING STRUCTURE ENTRANCE TO LIBERTY AND THE PARKING STRUCTURE WOULD REMAIN OPEN. THAT'S SOMETHING THEY WANTED TO TRY FOR 30 DAYS. THE HANDICAP PARKING IS SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN, YOU KNOW, SOMETHING W TALD ABOUT AN SOMETHING WE KW WE HAVEO ADDRES BUT WE WERE WAITING TO GET THIS APPROVAL TONIGHT BEFORE WE MOVE FORWARD WITH A LOT OF THE DETAILS THAT STILL HAVE TO BE WORKED OUT.
06:26:19.141: >> City Admi Crawford: AYOU WERE TALKI ABOUT PICKUPEY SERVICE ANDHE STRATEGIES AROUND THAT?
06:26:24.413: >> YES, OBVIOUSLY, CARRY OUT SERVICE HAS BEEN AN ISSUE FOR A LOT OF THE RESTAURANTS AND WE REALIZE IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE. THE AREA ASSOCIATIONS HAVE TAKEN THAT BALANCE GOING BLOCK BY BLOCK, TALKING TO THE BUSINESSES AND I KNOW THAT THEY ARE GOING TO CLOSE THE BLOCKS WITH THE MAJORITY OF THE BUSINESS FEEL GOING TO BE MORESSENTIAL TO THEM THAN THE CARRY OUT PICKUP. FOR THOSE BUSINESSES THAT WILL NEED TO MAINTAIN THAT PICKUP, THE AREA ASSOCIATIONS ARE GOING TO BE LOOKING FOR SPOTS THAT THEY CAN USE AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE. AND KEEP IN MIND THAT A LOT OF BUSINESSES -- IHOULDN'T S A LOT. SOMEF THE BUSINESS HAVE ALLEY ACCESS AND THERE ARE CREATIVE THINGS THAT WE CAN LOOK AT AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS.
06:27:13.162: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
06:27:14.730: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. AND THANKS FOR STAFF FOR STAYING UP THIS LATE TO BE HERE TO BETTER ARTICULATE THE PROPOSED PLAN THA PERHA I COULD AT 1:30 IN THE MORNING. AND ALL OF THESE QUESTIONS THAT ARE BEING RAISED HAVE BEEN RAISED MANY TIMES IN THE MANY MEETINGS THAT I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED WITH COUNCILMEMBER LUMM AND MANY OTHERS AND LA MAURA AND TOM AND THE LIST GOES ON. AND SO, AGAIN, I THINK FOLKS WHO LOOK AT THE HEALTHY STREETS MAP ARE LOOKING AND ASSUMING GREATEST CASE SCENARIO. AS MAURA POINTED OUT, THAT IS THE MOST THAT WOULD BE AFFECTED. WE WANTED TO STREAMLINE THIS AND GET A LE LINE TO THESE SMALL BUSINESSES AND HELP OUR RESIDENTS PRACTICE SOCIAL DISTANCING. I THINK IT WAS A COUPLE GOALS WE ARE TRYING TO MEET HERE WITH THIS AND WE ARE BEING SENSITIVE TO THE RESIDENTS WOULD NEED ACCESS TO THEIR -- WE ARE VERY COGNIZANT. ALL OF MY BUSINESS TODAY WAS TO GO. AND WE UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF CURBSIDE AND DELIVERY SERVICE AS WE GO FORWARD BUT I WAS REALLY PUSHING THIS AS MUCH AS I COULD, AND I ARECIATE STA'S ACHENG TO IT SO WE COULD HAVE SOMETHING IN PLACE WHEN THE STAY AT HOME ORDER IS LIFTED. AS WE ALL KNOW EARLIER TODAY, THE GOVERNOR HAS ANNOUNCED MONDAY AS THE DATE THAT THE RESTRICTIONS ON THE RESTAURANTS AND BARS WILL BE LIFTED TO 50% OCCUPANTLY. I THINK IT'S IMPORNT THA WE GETOMETHING IN PLACE, THE DETAILED -- I UNDERSTAND WE ALL WANT THE DETAILS TO HAVE A BETTER LEVEL OF COMFORT BUT I THINK WE HAVE A PRETTY WELL ORGL ORGANIZATIONAL TEAM WHO CAN BETTER HANDLE THOSE  CONCERNED S THAN EVEN MYSELF. STREET BY STREET IS VASTLY DIFFERENT. I WOULDN'T FEEL COMFORTABLE BRINGING THIS TO COUNCIL IF I NO UTILTHOUGHT IT WOULD BE HARMFULO SMALL BUSINESSES. WE HAD DOZENS OF EMAILS SUPPORTIVE OF THIS. THERE ARE A COUPLE OF PEOPLE WOULD AREONCERNED BAUSE OF SOMEFHE UNKNOWNS THAT STALE MY EXIST BUT DON'T LET THE PERFECTION BE THE ENEMY OF GOOD, IF I'M EVEN SAYING THAT RIGHT AT ALMOST 2:00 IN THE MORNING. SO I REALLYEEL COMFORTABLE ADVOCATING FOR THIS IS EVEN IN LIGHT OF SOME OF THE CONCERNS WE HEARD.
06:30:29.291: >> Councilmember Hayner:  JUST TWO QUESTIONS ABOUT TWO ARE E SOLVE CLAUSES. THE THIRD RESOLVE CLAUSE SAYS THAT AND ANY PUBLIC PARKING LOTS THAT MEA T SURFAOTS OR THE PARKING STRUCTURES.
06:30:46.108: >> THAT REFERS TO THE SURFACE LOTS THEMSELVES, BUT THERE'S SOME LIMITATIONS ON THAT. THE NEXT PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT COUNCIL WILL CONSIDER SPEAKS TO THE OUTDOOR SERVICE PERMIT THAT MLCC HAS DEVELOPED FOR THE PANDEMIC AND RESTAURANTS WILL ONLY BE ABLE TO SERVE WITHIN CERTAIN PROXIMITY OF THEIR ACTUAL ESTABLISHMENT, THOUGH THIS IS NOT -- THIS IS NOT A SITUATION WHERE, YOU KNOW, WE WILL BE SHUTTING DOWN A MASSIVE PARKING LOT DOWNTOWN AND JUST HAVING OUR RESTAURANTS SENDING BEER THROUGH THE WHOLE THING. IT REALLY IS JUST ADDED IN TO CREATE, YOU KNOW THOSE FEW INSTANCES WRE THERE MAY B SOME ADDED VALUE, FOR BAR OR RESTAURANT TO HAVE SOME OUTDOOR SEATING. WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT FLEXIBILITY WAS THERE.
06:31:35.991: >> Councilmember Hayner:  SO THEN THE FOURTH RESOLVE CLAUSE THAT SPEAKS TO MAYNARD STREET. IT SAYS COMPLETELY. I KNOW YOU SAID THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT BASICALLY NORTH OF THE PARKING STRUCTURE ENTRANCE TO COME DOWN THATTREET ANDG MAKE A U-TURN, RIGHT? I ASSUME THAT -- BETWEEN THE DATES SPECIFIED AND THE DATES SPECIFIED ARE JUNE 13th TO NOTHING. IT'S OPEN ENDED. SO --
06:32:04.019: >> I BELIEVE THE IT DATE SPECIFIED COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER WHERE THE GOVERNOR'STHE POINT RESTRICTIONS ON SEATING WOULD BE LIFTED. AND SO IF THE INTENT OF THE RESOLUTION IS TO ABOUT HELP BUSINESSES WHO ARE AT 50% SEATING CAPACITY, THIS WOULD START OPEN THE 13th AND GO AS LONG AS THAT RESTRICTION WAS IN PLACE.
06:32:27.776: >> Councilmember Hayner:  ALL RIGHT. SO THIS IS -- WOULD YOU SAY THIS IS MORE BUSINESSRIENTED OR HEALTH ORIENTED?
06:32:34.783: >> I'M NOT SURE THAT IT'S ONE OVER THE OTHER.
06:32:37.252: >> Councilmember Hayner:  ALL RIGHT. JUST CURIOUS. THANK YOU.
06:32:44.593: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI -- I THOUGHT I HAD CRAWFORD. DID YOU DROP OFF?
06:32:51.433: >> City Admin. Crawford: I DID DROP OFF. IAS GOING TO POINT OUT TO EVERYONE. WE DON'T NORMALLY PLAN AND EXECUTE THIS WAY. IT WILL NOT NECESSARILY GO SMOOTHLY. YOU SHOULD PREPARE YOURSELVES FOR THAT, BUT BY SETTING A CAP ON WHAT CAN BE CLOSED, YOU PUT BOUNDARIES AROUND THIS, IF YOU APPROVE THIS RESOLUTION, BUT THEN THOSE BOUNDARIES WILL ADJUST AND MAKE IT AS SUCCESSFUL ASE C.
06:33:14.790: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
06:33:19.494: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. I DID PREPARE A COUPLE OF AMENDMENTS, ONE THAT ADDRESSES SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER HAS BROUGHT UP. IF MS. BEAUDRY CAN SEND THAT ONE AROUND, IT WAS TITLED AMENDMENT A FOR DC, 2WHERE IT DOES ALL FOR A SUNSET PROVISION, OF AUGUST 23rd. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR COUNCIL TO SET BOUNDARIES AND I BELIEVE THE COMMUNITY WOUANT SOME ASSURANCESS TO WHAT THE TIME FRAME IS AND NOT JUST HAVE IT OPEN ENDED. OBVIOUSLY, IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN REVIEW. SO I MOVE THAT THE -- TO PUT THAT FORTH. AND IN FACT, I APOLOGIZE. I DO WANT TO ADD OR CHANGE THE START DATE TO FRIDAY, JUNE 12th, ATHE MOST -- AS THE EARLIEST THAT THIS WOULD BE IN EFFECT.

06:43:16.458: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES. DC-2. SO I'M PROPOSING TO AMEND WITH THIS RESOLVE CLAUSE. IT READS AS FOLLOWS, RESOLVE THAT CITY COUNCIL GRANTS THE AND T FLEXIBITY TO EXPAND OR SCALE DOWN THE CLOSURE DAYS AND TIMES OF BLOCKS WITHIN EACH BUSINESS DISTRICT. IF SOMEONE COULD SECOND THAT.
06:43:40.515: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE A SECOND? SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, YOU STILL HAVEHE FLOOR.
06:43:50.592: >> Councilmember Lumm: JUST BRIEFLY, WE ALL RECEIVED AN EMAIL TODAY FROM ONE OF THE DOWNTOWN BUSINESS OWNERS AND I HAD A COUPLE OF EXCHANGES WITH STAFF AND COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI AND THE MAYOR, TO SEE IF -- IF MIGHT ADDHIS TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED ABOUT PROVIDING BASICALLY MORE FLEXIBILITY SO THIS DOESN'T AGAIN HAVE TO COME BACK TO COUNCIL AND AGAIN IT PROVIDES THE FLEXIBILITY THAT WAS REQUESTED. IT MAY HELP SOME BUSINESSED. AND THE INF THE FLEXIBILITY SO S DOESN'T HAVE TO COME BACK TO US AND IT MIGHT ALLOW FOR TO BE A BI MOREMBITIOUSITH CLOSURE UP FRONT AND IT CAN BE DONE ADMINISTRATIVELY AND AGAIN, WE SHOULD ALL KNOW THAT ANY STREET CLOSURES WILL NOT BE CLOSED -- THE PERMIT IS APPROVED WITH THE NORMAL STAFF PROTOCOLS.
06:45:11.372: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THIS FRIENDLY TO THE BODY. IT'S FRIENY. FUHER DISCUION OF THE MAIN MOTI AS AMENDED. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER? COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
06:45:21.349: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES, MY FINAL COMMENTS. AGAIN, SORRY I CAN'T JOIN YOU BY ZOOM. I WILL JUST COMMENT ON THIS ITEM AND DC-3. BECAUSE THESE ARE TWO RELATED RESOLUTIONS ON THE AGENDA, AND I WILL JUST SAY I'M HAPPY TO BE A COSPONR ON THEM,LONG WH U, MR. MAYOR AND COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI AND I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE STAFF AND THE DDA AND AT DOWNTOWN BUSINESS ASSOCIATIONS FOR THEIRHARD WORK IN PUTTING THESE PROPOSALS TO GO AND THE $50,000 GRANT FOR THE BARRICADES. THE COVID-19 PANDEMICAS WIOUT QUESTN HITUR BUSISSES VERY,ERY HARD. AND WHAT THIS RESOLUTION DOES IS IT IT TRIES TO SUPPORT OUR BUSINESSES IN THE USE OF DOWNTOWN TREATED FOR SOCIAL DISTANT COMPLIANT SEATING AND SALES ON WEEKENDS UNTIL THE TIME WHEN THE NUMBER OF PPLE ALLOD. SESTAURANTS AND THE RETAIL STORES IS NO LONGER LIMITS. THIS RESOLUTION DC-2 SETS UP THE GROUND RULES AS WE DISCUSSED. AND DC-3 PROVIDES COUNCIL THAT TEMPORARY OUTDOOR LIQUOR LICENSES BE ESTABLISHED FOR THOSE THAT HAVE IOOR LICENS. SO AS HAS BEEN NOTES. THE RESOLUTIONS ARE SETTING UP THE MECHANISM TO DO THIS. AND IT WASN'T ALL THAT EASY. I APPRECIATED EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THAT IT WAS COMPLICATED. IT IS COMPLICATED AND THAT THE SPECIFIC NEEDS OF EACH OF THE BUSINESS NEGOTIATIONS AND THE TYPES OF BUSINESSES DIFFE AND SO WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS THE INPUT AND THE PREFERENCES OF THE ASSOCIATIONS WHO CONSULTED WITH ALL OF THEIR INDIVIDUAL BUSINESSES AND I DO APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK AND COMMUNICATION BY THE MANY PEOPLE HAVE BASKETBALL INVOLVED IN THIS. AND EVERYONE RECOGNIZES IT MAY NEED TO BE TWEAKED, BUT THE IMPORTANT THING HERE IS THAT THE OVERALL APPROACH PUTS THE BALL IN THE COURT OF MERCHANT ASSOCIATIONS AND THE CITY TO DETERMINE WHAT IS EVERYONE'S BEST INTERESTS. THIS MAY WELL NEED TO BE CHANGES ALONG THE WAY, A THAS F THE LAST RESOLVE CLAUSE TO BE FRIENDLY. I THINK IT'S A WELL THOUGHT OUT PLAN. AND I KNOW WE ALL SHARE THE SAME GOAL THAT HE WITH WANT TO SUPPORT OUR LOCAL BUSINESSES AND DO WHAT WE CAN TO AID IN THEIR RECOVERY AND I DO THINK THAT THIS IS A GREAT WAY THAT THE CITY CAN DO THAT, AND HOPE WE CAN ALL SUPPORT THIS TONIGHT.
06:48:05.747: >> Mayoraylor: COUNCILMEMBER YNER ON THE MAIN MOTION AS AMENDED.
06:48:12.720: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES, SO THE PENULTIMATE RESOLVE CLAUSE THERE'S SOME BOILER PLATE TO THAT WHERE THEY SPEAK OF EVERYONE HAVING TO CARRY INSURANCE LIKE TYPICALLY FOR CLOSING A SIDEWALK OR A STREET AND NAMING THE CITY OF NOMAR CIR AS AN ADDITIONAL INSURED. DOES ANN ARBOR HE -- AFFTING THE STREET CLOSURES AGAIN THE WISH OF A COUPLE MERCHANTS WHICH ONE SPOKE AT PUBLIC HEARING TONIGHT, ARE WE SOMEHOW INSURED FROM LIABILITY, LIKE IF THAT BUSINESS -- IF THEY GO OUT OF BUSINESS BECAUSE WE CAN'T REACT QUICKLY ENOUGH, ARE WE IMMUNE FROM ANY KIND OF LIABILITY THAT WE CAUSED THAT BUSINESS WIT TH NOTIONF CSING STREETS? THAT'S JUST A GENERAL QUESTION. I WANT TO THROW OUT THERE FOR US TO THINK ABOUT. SECONDLY, I THOUGHT THAT THIS HEALTHY -- I MEAN, THIS IS FINE WHAT WE ARE DOING HERE DOWNTOWN, BUT I THOUGHT THE HEALTHY STREETS WAS LIKE THE NOTION WAS LIKE TO CLOSE STREETS AND NEIGHBORHOODS SO PEOPLE COULD WALK IN NEIGHBORHOODS AND STUFF. IS THAT COMING FORWARD SEPARATELY FROM THI TS IDEA OF WHERE VARIOUS PEOPLE WERE GOING TO PUT INTO THE WEBSITES WHAT STREETS THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE CLOSED? OBVIOUSLY THAT'S A COMPLETELY SEPARATE THING.
06:49:27.361: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. CRAWFORD.
06:49:29.030: >> City Admin. Crawford: YEAH, THE -- THAT DOES NOT HAVE TO COME BACK TO COUNCIL. THE NEIGHBORHOOD ONES DO NOT HAVE TO COME BACK TO COUNCIL. IT'S ONE-THIRD OF THE RESIDEN ON THE BCK APPROVE IT, AND THEN -- THEN YOU HAVE AUTHORIZED THAT WITH THE RESOLUTION. THE OTHER ONES HAVE NOT COME BACK TO COUNCIL YET.
06:49:44.946: >> Councilmember Hayner:  OH, OKAY. AND SO THAT'S JUST THE LOCAL TRAFFIC ONLY, THE SIGNAGE THAT ONE, THE ONE-THIRD?
06:49:52.153: >> City Admin. Crawford: I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE SIGNAGE IS.
06:49:54.689: >> Councilmember Hayner: OKAY. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU.
06:49:58.159: >>ayor Taylor: RTHER SCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] ALL OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. DC-3 RESOLUTION TO APPROVE OUTDOOR SALES, SERVICE AND CONSUMPTION OF ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES DURING THE COVID-19 NDEMIC. MOVED BY RAMLA AND SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD. DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
06:50:27.955: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YEAH, I MEAN, I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY. I WILL TRY TO MAKE THIS QUICK. I WILL PUT SOMETHING IN PLACE SO WHEN THE STATE DOES ALLOW FOR THIS TYPE OF CONSUMPTION OF ALCOHOL IN PUBLIC SPACES, THAT OUR BUSESSES AREEADY TO GO WITH IT. AGAIN, IT'S -- YOU KNOW, MANY PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THIS, BUT MANY OF THESE RESTAURANTS WOULD NOT EXIST WITHOUT ALCOHOL SALES. IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE -- IT DOESN'T MAKE DOLLARS. IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE DOING WHAT I DO I WAS ABLEO DEAL WITH IT BECAUSE MY BUSINESS WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, BUT YOU SAY THAT OUT FROM UNDERNEATH ME AND I NEED TO START S SELLING BOOZE. THERE'S NO WAY TO PAY $40 OR $50 FOOD.ARE FOOT AND JUST SELL IHINK THICAN BDONE I A RESPONSIBLE WAY, AND IN A WAY THAT CAN HELP TO ENSURE THE CULTURE AND THE DIVERSITY AND THE ATTRACTIONS THAT WE HAVE DOWNTOWN. I MEAN, I REALLY AM EXTREMELY CONCERNED ABOUT THE FUTURE OF DOWNTOWN. I KNOW IT WILL HAVE OPPORTUNITIES, BUT WITHOUT YOUR RESTAURANTS AND BARS, I'M NOT SURE I'M NOT SURE WHAT IS DOWNTOWN ANY LONGER. SO, YOU KNOW, IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. THE VITALITY OF DOWNTOWN IS AT RISK RIGHT NOW.
06:52:19.767: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
06:52:20.634: >> Councilmember Hayner:  THE FIRST RESOLVE CLAUSE HAS ATTACHED NAME AND THERE ARE LIQUOR LICENSES THAT DO NOT APPEAR ON THAT LIST THAT ARE WELL WITHIN THE STREET ZONES. SOOW DOES ONE GET THEIR BUSINESS ONHIS LIST THAT IS REFERRED TO?
06:52:37.752: >> WE CAN DOUBLE CHECK THAT LIST BUT THAT SHOULD BE A LIST OF EVERY ON PREMISE LIQUOR LICENSE WITHIN THE DDA ZONE. IF THERE ARE BUSINESSES THAT ARE ABSENT WE CAN BRING THEM FORWARD TO COUNCIL, BUT THIS LIST IS -- THE -- EACH INDIDUAL BUSINS WILLAVE T MAKE ALICATION TO TH MLCT. PART OF THAT REQUIRES THE CONTENT OF THE CITY AND THIS IS THE PREEMPTIVE CONSENT IF THE BUSINESSES APPLY AND IF THERE ARE BUSINESSES WOULD ARE ABSENT, WE CAN BRING THAT FORTH.
06:53:09.884: >> Councilmember Hayner:  AND THAT WOULD HAVE TO COME THROUGH AS PART OF A COUNCIL RESOLUTION TO AMEND THE LIST?
06:53:14.688: >> WE WILL JUST  WE WILL BRING FORT THE SOND LIST WITH ANY BUSINESSES THAT ARE ABSENT.
06:53:25.399: >> Councilmember Hayner:  WHY SUPPORT IT WITHOUT THE BUSINESSES BEING PUT ON THERE. FOR SURE THERE ARE BUSINESSES THAT THAT ARE NOT ON THAT LIST I KNOW IT ONE OF THEM CONTACTEDE TODAY.
06:53:40.114: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT.
06:53:44.185: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THIS MAY BE FOR MONTH FORNIER. DO WE HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT THE TIMELINE IS WITH ANY THE LEGISLATION THAT'S BEING PROPOSED IN LANSING WITH OPEN CONTAINER?
06:53:56.597: >> SO THIS IS SPRAY  FROM THAT LEGISLATION THAT YOU ARE REFERRING TO -- SO THIS IS SEPARATE FROM THAT LEGISLATION THAT YOU ARE REFERRING TO. I DON'T KNOW WHAT CHANCE THAT LEGISLATION HAS TO PASS. I DON'T KNOW THAT IT WILL PASS. I KNOW IT'S GETTING SOME DISCUSSION, BUT THIS LEGISLATION THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT HERE IS RELAD T A N PERMIT THE THAT THE MLCC HAS CREATED AND IT'S SEPARATE FROM ANY LEGISLATIVE ACTION.
06:54:38.706: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE TIMELINE IS ON THAT ENABLIN
06:54:43.344: >> DYOU MEAN F THE MLCC PERMIT?
06:54:45.613: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YEAH.
06:54:46.413: >> THERE IS NO LEGISLATION LEGIH THE MLCC PERMIT. THE STAFF HAS CREATED THE IN YOU PERMIT. I NOW KRISTEN LARCOM WAS IN DIRECT CONTACT WITH THE MLCC AND PERHAPS SHE CAN PROVIDE SOME ILLUMINATION ON THE TIMELIN
06:55:07.168: >> YES. THIS IS DOCTO -- THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT CONCERNS HERE. ONE IS BUSINESSES THAT -- OR ESTABLISHMENTS THAT ALRDY HAVE SIDEWA SPACE. STREET. TO EXPAND IN THE THERE'S A WAY FOR THEM TO DO THAT. THEY NEED TO MAKE AN APPLICATION TO THE MLCC. THERE IS ALSO A NEW APPLICATION FORM THATSTABLISHMENT THAT D NO CURRENTLY HE OUTDOOR SERVICE WILL BE ABLE TO APPLY FOR THAT AND NORMALLY, A TEMPORARY OUTDOOR SERVICE WOULD BE ONLY FOR 12 DAYS. THIS NEW FORM THAT THEY HAVE JUST WORKED UP. -- AND I HAVE BEEN SPEAKING WITH PEOPLE AT THE MLCC. IT JUST CAME OUT LAST WEEK. BUT THEY ARE COMMITTED TO ENABLING RESTAURANTS AND BUSINESSES TO OPEN UP AGAIN AND SO THEY WILL BE WORKING WITH ESTABLISHMENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO DO THIS. THAT'S WHAT VER BEEN TOLD.
06:56:33.654: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE THIS LATE.

I APPRECIATE IT AND I APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S -- YOU KNOW, THESE HAVE BEEN TWO VERY LONG MEETINGS THAT WE HAD BACK-TO-BACK AND I KNOW MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY ARE UPSET WITH US FOR TAKING THIS LONG TO TALK TO PEOPLE'S BUSINE, BUT I THINK THAT THAT KIND OF CRITICISM IS, IN MY VIEW WELCOMED. I THINK WE ARE BEING DELIBERATIVE AND WE ARE DEBATING THINGS AND FLESHING OUT THINGS AND WE ARE HAVING GOOD CONVERSATION AND SOME DISAGREEMENTS OBVIOUSLY. BUT WE'RE LEARNING A LOT. WE ARE DISCOVERING NEW THINGS AN WE'RE TRYG TO, YOU KNOW, FIND WHAT WE CAN UNDER EVERY ROCK AND STONE THERE IS. AND I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE, YOU KNOW, -- YOU KNOW, BE TOLD THAT WE ARE KEEPING THE PUBLIC FROM PARTICIPATING. IN FACT, WE HAD NEARLY TWO HOURS OF PUBLIC COMMENT TONIGHT ABOUT A2ZERO. SO THE CRITICISM THAT THIS COUNCIL HAS RECEIVED RECENTLY FOR LATE MEETINGS, I THINK IS UNFAIR. I THINK WE SHOULD BE APPLAUDED. I THINK WE SHOULD BE THANKS. ON THE BACK FOR PUTTING THISEN T MUCH TIME AND ENERGY FOR DISCUSSING THE PEOPLE'S BUSINESS. I THINK WE HAVE DONE A LOT AND TIME WILL PROVE THAT. FURTHER COMMUNICATION FROM COUNCIL? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?

WE DID IT WITH THE BUDGET AND NOW WE DID IT TONIGHT. SHAME ON ME FOR CALLING FOR A PUBLIC HEARING ON A $1 BILLION CLIMATE ACTION PLAN. I DON'T REGRET DOING THAT, BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO HEAR FROM PEOPLE BUT WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO NOT DO THE PELE'S BUSINES AFTER ITS NOT RIGHT. IT'S JUST NOT RIGHT. IT'S NOT PUBLIC. AND THIS IS A PUBLIC MATTER BEFORE US. I WANTED TO PUT THIS OUT THERE AND THANK FOR EVERYBODY FOR HANGING UP. IT DOESN'T BOTHER ME, BUT I'M USUALLY UP TO 4:00 ANYWAY.
