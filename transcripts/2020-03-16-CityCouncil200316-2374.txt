00:00:55.266: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI: HERE.
00:00:56.901: >> Clerk Beaudry: WE HAVE A QUORUM. MAY I HAVE A MOTION TO APPROVE THE AGENDA. MOVED AND SECOND. WOULD THE ADMINISTRATOR LIKE US TO REMOVE ALL THE EIGHT-VOTE ITEMS ON THE AGENDA BY FIAT?
00:01:13.150: >> YES.
00:01:13.417: >> Mayor Taylor: I WILL CONSIDER THAT A FRIENDLY AMENDMENT. FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE AGENDA? THANK YOU, THEY ARE DEEMED TO BE POSTPONED RATHER THAN MOVED TO FROM THE AGENDA. IS THAT ACCEPTABLE? WELL -- NO, IT'S NOT A POSTPONEMENT BECAUSE THEY ARE OFF THE AGENDA. SO WE WILL JUST BRING THEM ON BACK. THE STAFF WILL BRING THEM OPEN BACK ON THEIR OWN ACCORD. OKAY. FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE AGENDA AS AMENDED. ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? THE AGENDA AS AMENDED IS APPROVED. DO WE HAVE COMMUNICATIONS TODAY FROM OUR CITY ADMINISTRATOR?
00:01:46.951: >> City Admin. Crawford: YES. YES, SIR. SO WITH THE COVID OUTBREAK, STAFF HAS HAD TO DO A LOT REPRIORITIZATION. IT'S BEEN A VERY BUSY WEEK OR TWO. TODAY WE ANNOUNCED TO STAFF THAT WE WOULD CLOSE CITY HALL FOR ALL BUT ESSENTIAL SERVICES. SO THAT MEANS THAT YOUR FIRE, POLICE, SOLID WASTE, WATER SERVICES, THOSE THINGS WILL CONTINUE. WE'RE ENCOURAGING OUR RESIDENTS THAT WE -- THAT -- TO UTILIZE OUR ONLINE OPTIONS FOR SERVICES, AND TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN SUPPORT THOSE WITH EMPLOYEES WHO ARE TELECOMMUTING, WE WILL DO SO, HOWEVER, OUR FOCUS WILL BE OPEN ESSENTIAL SERVICES. THIS TERM IS EXPECTED TO GO UNTIL APRIL 5th. AT THIS TIME.HOWEVER, ONE OF THT CANNOT BE DELAYED -- I GUESS, IN ADDITION TO THAT, AS I HAVE GOTTEN UP TO SPEED ON -- OR GETTING UP TO SPEED ON SOME ITEMS, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF COUNCIL DIRECTIVES GIVEN TO THE ADMINISTRATOR OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS AND WITH THIS CLOSURE, I'M PLANNING TO MOVE ALL OF THOSE BACK 60 DAYS, ALL THE DEADLINES BACK 60 DAYS. IF THAT IS A PROBLEM FOR ANY COUNCILMEMBER, PLEASE CONTACT ME AFTERWARDS INDIVIDUALLY AND I CAN LOOK AT THOSE, BUT AT THIS TIME, I ANTICIPATE NEEDING TO MOVE ALL OF THOSE DEADLINES BACK ENMASS. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CANNOT BE DELAYED IS THE PREPARATION OF THE CITY BUDGET. THAT IS A CHARTER REQUIREMENT. AND I'M GOING TO BE FOCUSING ON THAT SOON. I DID WANT TO TOUCH BASE WITH COUNCIL TO GIVE YOU A PERSPECTIVE OF HOW I PLAN TO APPROACH THAT. THIS IS A VERY UNCLEAR TIME, VERY VOLATILE TIME. SO IT'S NOT CLEAR WHETHER THE EVENTS WE ARE GOING THROUGH ARE GOING TO HAVE A SHORT TERM, A YEAR OR LONG-TERM IMPACT. THAT -- THAT VOLATILITY MAKES DEVELOPING A BUDGET CHALLENGING. SO MY PLAN IN THIS DEVELOPMENT IS NOT TO MAKE -- WHEN I LOOK AT THE IMPACTS THAT YOU WERE -- THAT YOU HAVE BEEN PRESENTED AND WE'LL SEE, MY MAN IS TO NOT REALLY VEER A WHOLE LOT FROM STANDARD COURSE. I WOULD PROBABLY DO SOME TWEAKING HERE AND THERE. THIS WOULD -- THIS WOULD ESTABLISH A BUDGET BASELINE FOR US TO CONTINUE OPERATIONS AS WE WERE KIND OF GOING -- HEADED ON ANYWAY. THAT DOES NOT FORESTALL THE FACT THAT IF WE OBSERVE AN ECONOMIC SITUATION THAT IS MORE ROOTED THAN WE MAY HAVE A MID-YEAR ADJUSTMENT. JUST BECAUSE YOU APPROVED THIS PLAN OR WHATEVER COMES OUT OF THIS PLAN AS AMENDED, AS A DIRECTION, THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT WE WILL NECESSARILY DO EVERYTHING THAT WAS AVAILABLE BASED ON HOW WE OPERATE IN THE YEAR. AGAIN, IF THAT'S OF CONCERN TO COUNCILMEMBERS, PLEASE LET ME KNOW AFTER THE MEETING. I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THERE ARE -- IN AN EFFORT TO HELP THE SMALL BUSINESSES IN TOWN, PARTICULARLY THE DOWNTOWN, THE D.D.A. HAS OPENED THEIR PARKING DECKS AND LOTS. THEY WILL BE FREE FROM NOW THROUGH I BELIEVE IT WAS APRIL 5th. THAT ALLOWS HOPEFULLY PEOPLE TO FEEL MORE FREE TO COME DOWNTOWN AND SUPPORT THEIR LOCAL BUSINESSES. THE D.D.A. IS ALSO GOING TO BE BAGGING THE METERS IN FRONT OF THE BARS AND RESTAURANTS DOWNTOWN, SO THAT PICKUP AND DROPOFF CAN BE EXPEDITED AND EFFICIENT FOR VISITORS. THE CITY DOES ANTICIPATE CONTINUING PARKING ENFORCEMENT FOR THE ON-STREET METERS TO ENSURE THAT THE RETAIL BUSINESSES HAVE THE APPROPRIATE TURNOVER AND MANAGEMENT OF TRAFFIC THAT SUPPORTS AN EFFICIENT OPERATION OF DOWNTOWN. LASTLY, I JUST WANT TO THANK OFFICER KELLER FOR BEING HERE TONIGHT. THANK YOU.
00:05:48.525: >> Mayor Taylor: WE NOW, IF WE MAY, THE CENTER OF THE CITY TASK FORCE FINAL REPORT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANKS FOR BEING HERE TONIGHT.
00:05:55.065: >> YOU'RE WELCOME. I'M HEATHER SEYFARTH, SERVED AS THE STAFF LIAISON TO THE TASK FORCE FOR THE PAST SIX MONTHS AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE SEVERAL TASK FORCE MEMBERS HERE TONIGHT. SO WE HAVE THE CHAIR MEGAN MUSALT AND THE VICE CHAIR, WHO ARE GOING TO PRESENT AN OVERVIEW OF THE PROCESS, AND THE OUTCOME OF THE REPORT. AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE ALLEN HABER HERE TOO. SO AT THE END YOU CAN ASK ANY ONE OF US QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. I TURN IT OVER TO YOU.
00:06:21.725: >> HI, GOOD EVENING. I'M MEGAN MOUSOUF. AND MILES/.
00:06:32.135: >> MY NAME IS MILES AND I'M THE VICE CHAIR OF THE TASK FORCE.
00:06:35.239: >> THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING US TO COME IN AND GIVE US AN OVERVIEW OF THE REPORT AND WHAT WE COME TO AS A GROUP. SO LET ME MAKE SURE I CAN DO THAT. YAY! OKAY. SO AS A REMINDER THIS IS THE TASK FORCE. THERE WAS A GROUP OF PEOPLE, NINE OF US, COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND THEN TWO LIAISONS FROM CITY COUNCIL, ONE IS COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, AND OTHER REPRESENTATIVE WAS COUNCILMEMBER SMITH, AND WE REPRESENTED A LOT OF DIFFERENT, I THINK, EXPERIENCES AND EXPERTISE. WE HAD SOME URBAN PLANNING. WE HAD SOME ARCHITECTS. WE HAD SOME STUDENTS. I'M A LIBRARIAN, RIGHT? SO WE HAD A LOT PEOPLE COME TOGETHER TO WORK ON THIS WORK TOGETHER, AND, YOU KNOW, THERE ARE JUST THREE OF US HERE TODAY, BUT I REALLY WANT TO REALLY DRIVE HOME THAT THE WORK THAT WE ARE PRESENTING TODAY WAS A GROUP EFFORT. WE NEVER WOULD HAVE GOTTEN THIS FAR WITHOUT THIS AMAZING GROUP OF PEOPLE TO SORT OF STEWARD THIS WORK AND WORK TOGETHER. I'M LOOKING AT MILES TO MAKE SURE I'M SAYING EVERYTHING. AS A REMINDER, THIS WAS THE TASK GIVEN TO THE TASK FORCE. WE WERE ASKED TO, ONE, ENGAGE CITIZENS ENVISIONING LONG-TERM PLANNING AND IMMEDIATE AND INTERMITTENT USES BUILDING TOWARDS THE FINAL USES OF THE LIBRARY BLOCK AND SECOND TO DEVELOP RECOMMENDATIONS TO HELP DETERMINE THE NEXT STEP TO DEVELOP THE CENTRAL PARK AND CIVIC CENTER COMMONS KNOWN AS THE CENTER OF THE CITY COMMONS. AND THIS IS JUST A LITTLE BIT OF AN OVERVIEW OF THE PROCESS THAT WE WENT THROUGH. SO STEP ONE WAS TO REALLY THINK ABOUT ALL THE INFORMATION AND ALL THE WORK THAT HAD GONE INTO THINKING ABOUT WHAT TO -- WHAT TO DO WITH THOSE SPACES, WHAT TO DO WITH THAT LAND. WE HAD ONE ROUND OF SOLICITING IDEAS FROM THE COMMUNITY AND WE'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THIS AS THIS GOES ON TODAY. THEN WE CAME BACK TOGETHER AS A TASK FORCE TO REVIEW WHAT WE HEARD, AND DEVELOP SOME PRELIMINARY RECOMMENDATIONS. THINK ABOUT WHAT OPPORTUNITIES WE HAD TO GO BACK TO THE COMMUNITY TO ASK FOR INFORMATION. WE, AGAIN, BROUGHT THAT BACK TOGETHER AND THEN USED THAT INFORMATION -- USED WHAT WE HEARD FROM THE COMMUNITY TO DEVELOP A FINAL SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS. I'M KIND OF TALKING FAST BECAUSE I KNOW WE HAVE A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME. ALL RIGHT. I WILL GIVE IT TO MILES TO TALK ABOUT NOTIFICATION.
00:08:50.240: >> WELL, SINCE YOU ALL HAVE THE POWERPOINT, I WON'T GO THROUGH READING WORD FOR WORD FROM IT, BUT I WILL SAY THAT THANKS ESPECIALLY TO HEATHER, WE WERE ABLE TO USE REALLY ALL OF THE CITY'S ABILITIES FOR CONTACT. WE USED DIGITAL KOHL TACT EMAIL, SOCIAL MEDIA. WE PHYSICALLY MAILED ABOUT, I BELIEVE, 6500 COPIES OF A RLS FLYER THAT YOU WILL SEE LATER ON. AND THEN A BIG PART OF OUR CONTACT WAS ACTUALLY PERSON-TO-PERSON, AND HEARING PEOPLE'S IDEAS AND SOLICITING THEIR FEEDBACK. WE HAD A NUMBER OF INPUT OPPORTUNITIES AS WELL. AT BOTH OF OUR OPEN HOUSES AT OUR TASK FORCE MEETINGS, AND THROUGH OUR USE OF OUR IDEA POD ON BOTH LIBRARY LOT AND ON LIBERTY PLAZA, AND THROUGHOUT OUR PROCESS, WE WERE -- WE WERE BOTH PLEASANTLY SURPRISED AND VERY HAPPY TO SEE THE ENGAGEMENT AND THE CONCERN AND THE ENTHUSIASM THAT OUR COMMUNITY HAS FOR THIS PROJECT.
00:10:07.484: >> WE'RE SORT OF LIKE WINGING THIS, IF YOU COULDN'T TELL. JUST TO GO IN A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS WE DID. SO ONE OF THE AMAZING THINGS WE DID WAS THAT WE HOSTED WHAT WE CALL THE IDEA POD AND WE DID TWO VERSIONS OF THIS. IT'S A STRUCTURE THAT WE SET UP AND ONE VERSION, IT WAS ON THE LIBRARY LOT PARKING LOT ITSELF AND THEN THE SECOND ONE WAS IN LIBERTY PLAZA AND IT WAS THIS AMAZING OPPORTUNITY TO REALTIME TO SORT OF GET PEOPLE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION, ENGAGE IN THE ISSUES THAT WERE SURROUNDING, LIKE WHAT DO WE AS A COMMUNITY TO DO WITH THIS SPACE AND JUST A SHOUT OUT TO ALLEN WHO IS HERE AND OUR COLLEAGUE JOHN WHO SPENT A LOT OF TIME TALKING TO COMMUNITY MEMBERS DURING THESE TWO ENGAGEMENTS AND I THINK WE ACTUALLY HAVE TWO PICTURES HERE. YOU CAN SEE IT WAS AN AMAZING OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY ENGAGE AT A DEEPER LEVEL WITH PEOPLE FROM THE COMMUNITY ABOUT WHAT WE MIGHT DO WITH THIS SPACE. THE OTHER THING WE DID TO GATHER COMMUNITY INPUT IS THAT WE HELD TWO OPEN HOUSES. SO THE FIRST ONE WAS IN NOVEMBER, AND WE HAD ABOUT 150 PEOPLE COME FROM THE COMMUNITY AND ENGAGE WITH US AROUND A NUMBER OF ISSUES ABOUT, YOU KNOW WHO IS THE AUDIENCE FOR THIS SPACE? IDEALLY WHAT KIND OF ACTIVITIES HAPPEN THERE? OTHER SORT OF QUESTIONS THAT WE POSED TO THE GROUPS AND WE TRIED TO HAVE A VERY INTERACTIVE OPEN HOUSE STYLE TO TRY TO GET AS MANY PERSPECTIVES AND MANY VIEW POINTS AS WE POSSIBLY CAN TO HELP INFORM OUR RECOMMENDATIONS. AND THERE'S ANOTHER PICTURE FROM THAT OPEN HOUSE. THE OTHER THING WE DID IS THAT WE WORKED TOGETHER AS A GROUP TO DESIGN A TARGETED MAILING. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT TO THE GROUP AS WE DID OUR WORK, AND YOU WILL SEE THAT IT'S ONE OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE WORK MOVING FORWARD, IS THAT WE WANTED TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE INVITED THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY INTO THIS PROCESS, MAKING SURE THAT WE HEARD DIVERSE PERSPECTIVES, MADE SURE THAT WE HEARD FROM NOT THE TYPICAL VOICES, THE SORT OF COME TO, YOU KNOW, CITY OPEN HOUSES, HOW DO WE ENGAGE WITH THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY. SO WE WORKED TOGETHER, TO SEND OUT THIS TARGETED MAILING. I BELIEVE WE SENT IT TO 6500 PEOPLE. I'M LOOKING HEATHER.
00:12:20.917: >> WE PRINTED ANOTHER 1,000 BEYOND THAT.
00:12:23.053: >> AND WE PRINTED ANOTHER 1,000, JUST TO SORT OF HAND OUT. THIS IS ANOTHER WAY WE TRIED TO PULL PEOPLE INTO THE CONVERSATION. AND THEN WE HELD A SECOND OPEN HOUSE IN JANUARY, AND THIS HAD ABOUT 75 PEOPLE AND I THINK ORIGINALLY, AS WE WERE PLANNING TOWARDS THIS OPEN HOUSE, WE THOUGHT WE WOULD LIST SOME PRELIMINARY RECOMMENDATIONS AND GET FEEDBACK FROM THE COMMUNITY, BUT ACTUALLY WHAT HAPPENS IS WE FOUND OUT THAT THERE WAS SOME OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS, SOME CONVERSATIONS, SOME POINTS OF TENSION, REALLY, IN THE COMMUNITY ABOUT WHAT WE DO WITH THIS SPACE. SO WE USED THE SECOND OPEN HOUSE TO REALLY TRY DEEPER TO DIVE INTO THIS. OKAY, WE ARE THIS HEARING THIS D FOR HOUSING? CAN THIS SPACE MOVE TOWARDS THAT? WHAT OTHER SORTS OF THINGS CAN WE TALK ABOUT AS A COMMUNITY TO TRY TO MOVE THIS CONVERSATION FORWARD? FEEL FREE TO JUMP IN AT ANY MOMENT. AND THEN THIS IS JUST ANOTHER PICTURE FROM THAT OPEN HOUSE. WIOH, AND ANOTHER PICTURE FROM THAT OPEN HOUSE. ALL RIGHT. I'M JUST GOING TO KEEP ON TALKING. LET ME KNOW IF YOU WANT TO JUMP IN. ALL RIGHT. SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS ASKED OF US AS A TASK FORCE WAS TO CREATE A VISION FOR THE SPACE AND JUST AS A REMINDER, THIS IS THE SPACE THAT IS BOUNDED BY FIFTH AND WILLIAM AND DIVISION AND LIBERTY, AND THIS IS OUR VISION FOR THAT SPACE. OUR VISION IS TO CREATE A SPACE THAT IS INCLUSIVE AND WELCOME TO EVERYONE, THAT IS SAFE, ACTIVE AND FOSTERS A CULTURE OF PEACE AND NONVIOLENCE, AND IS EASY TO SEE, EASY TO GET TO, AND EASY TO GET THROUGH. IT'S FLEXIBLE, ADAPTABLE AND SUSTAINABLE AND IS INSPIRING AND PROMOTES LIFELONG LEARNING. AND SO DEFINITELY THIS VISION HAS BEEN FORMED NOT ONLY BY THE WORK OF THE TASK FORCE BUT EVERYTHING WE HEARD FROM THE COMMUNITY. AND I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS WE DEFINITELY WANT TO DRIVE HOME IS THAT, YOU KNOW, WE DIDN'T SOLVE ALL THE PROBLEMS AND THEN IN SOME WAYS WE JUST STARTED THIS WORK AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AS THIS WORK MOVES FORWARD THAT WE CONTINUE TO ENGAGE WITH THE COMMUNITY, TO GET FURTHER INPUT TO SORT OF BRING THEM INTO THE CONVERSATION.
00:14:30.080: >> SO I THINK --
00:14:31.247: >> YEAH, GO AHEAD.
00:14:32.515: >>  -- ONE OTHER THING THAT YOU WILL NOTICE IS THAT WE HAVE -- IN OUR REPORT, WE DON'T HAVE ANY DESIGNS OR ANYTHING OF THAT NATURE, ANY VERY SPECIFIC AND CONCRETE STEPS AS TO WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE. INSTEAD, THIS IS MORE OF AS WAS ALREADY SAID, IT IS A STEP FORWARD AND A PROCESS THAT'S GOING TO BE LONGER, BUT IT'S ALSO GOING TO BE VERY MUCH COMMUNITY FOCUSED AND COMMUNITY DRIVEN. SO EVEN THOUGH WE ARE NOT COMING HERE WITH THE ANSWERS, WE ARE STILL VERY PROUD TO SAY THAT WE TOOK A STEP THAT WE THINK IS GOING TO PUT US IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION FOR A SOMEWHAT NOVEL IDEA ON HOW TO DESIGN PUBLIC SPACES.
00:15:19.429: >> AWESOME. SO THAT'S OUR VISION, AND THEN THE OTHER ASK OF US WAS TO DO RECOMMENDATIONS, AND WE HAVE MADE SIX RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THESE SPACES. SO I'M GOING TO READ THEM. NUMBER ONE IS FACILITATE THE FORMATION OF THE ANN ARBOR COUNCIL OF THE COMMONS. THIS GROUP WILL BE FORMED TO THINK ABOUT PROGRAMMING AND OTHER ACTIVITIES FOR THE SPACE. NUMBER TWO IS SCHEDULE REGULAR MEETINGS OF A SEPTEM CENTER OF E CITIES BLOCK PARTNER GROUP. AS WE DID OUR WORK, WE FOUND IT'S VERY, VERY CRUCIAL TO THE IMPORTANCE OF THE SPACE THAT WE PULL IN PARTNERS AROUND THE SPACE, INCLUDING BUSINESS OWNERS, INCLUDING RESIDENTS, INCLUDING THE LIBRARY AND OTHER IMPORTANT PARTNERS. NUMBER THREE, IS REMOVE GROUND LEVEL PARKING ON THE LIBRARY LOT PARKING STRUCTURE AND BEGIN EFFORTS TO REDESIGN AS AN ACTIVE PUBLIC SPACE. IT WAS VERY EVIDENT THAT HAVING AN ACTIVE SPACE FOR DISCOURSE WAS REALLY IMPORTANT TO THE COMMUNITY. NUMBER FOUR IS AUTHORIZE INITIAL PLANNING FOR THE LONG-TERM DEVELOPMENT OF THE CENTER OF THE CITY BLOCK AS THE PRIORITY UNDER THE CITY'S MASTER PLAN. NUMBER FIVE IS AUTHORIZE INITIAL PLANNING FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PUBLIC SPACES ON THE CENTER CITY BLOCK. SO REMINDER, THOSE PUBLIC SPACES ARE THE TOP OF THE PARKING STRUCTURE BUT ALSO LIBERTY PLAZA AND SO ALSO GIVING BOTH OF THOSE SPACES SOME ATTENTION AND LOVE AND CARE. AND THEN NEGOTIATE POTENTIAL AGREEMENTS OR EASEMENTS THAT ALLOW THE FUTURE EXPANSION OR CONNECTIONS OF THE PUBLIC SPACES ON THE CENTER OF THE CITY BLOCK. SO THIS IS JUST AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT COMES OUT OF OUR REPORT. SO FOR EACH RECOMMENDATION. FACILITATE THE FORMATION OF THE ANN ARBOR COUNCIL OF THE COMMONS. INCLUDED IN OUR REPORT IS WHO WE THINK IS THE RESPONSIBLE PARTY FOR MOVING THAT RECOMMENDATION FORWARD AND THEN A LIST OF GOALS AND ACTION ITEMS TO SORT OF HELP MOVE FORWARD THAT RECOMMENDATION. DUE TO TIME, I WILL NOT GO THROUGH ALL OF THESE, BUT JUST TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF WHAT IS INCLUDED IN THE REPORT. WE WANTED TO SPEND A LITTLE MITT OF TIME, BUT -- BIT OF TIME, BUT WE WANTED TO DRIVE THIS FORM. WHAT FORMED THESE RECOMMENDATIONS WAS THE COMMUNITY INPUT THAT WE RECEIVED. LIKE MILES SAID WE HAD A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO GATHER THAT INPUT. IN SOME WAYS WE HAD OVER 500 PEOPLE RESPOND TO OUR SURVEY. WE HAD A LOT OF INFORMATION FROM OUR COMMUNITY. IT SHOWS AN INVESTMENT IN THIS SPACE AND REAL DESIRE TO FORM THE FUTURE OF WHAT HAPPENS. WE WERE ALSO REALLY INFORMED BY THE PAST WORK THAT'S GONE INTO THINKING ABOUT THIS SPACE. SO THIS SPACE HAS BEEN A POINT OF CONVERSATION IN OUR COMMUNITY OR A VERY LONG TIME NOW. AND SO WE REALLY WANTED TO HONOR THAT PAST WORK, HONOR THOSE CONVERSATIONS, HONOR THE WORK THAT GOT US TO THIS POINT AND TIME, AND TO BUILD OFF OF THAT, AND NOT START FROM SCRATCH. AND THEN THE OTHER THING THAT REALLY INFORMED US IS THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS INCLUDED IN THE RESOLUTION AND OUR CHARGE WAS TO THINK ABOUT COMMONS AND COMMONNING, AND I THINK I THINK SPEAK PERSONALLY FOR MYSELF THAT THROUGH THIS ENGAGEMENT, THROUGH THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE COME AND SHARED THEIR TIME WITH US, SHARED THEIR EXPERTISE AND EXPERIENCE, WE LEARNED, WHAT IS A COMMONS? WHAT DOES COMMONNING MEAN AND HOW DO WE DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS IN OUR COMMUNITY OH, LAST THING. LAST THING WE DID, WE INFORMED OUR RECOMMENDATIONED, AND WAS ALSO THINKING ABOUT HOW DO WE CREATE SUSTAINABLE AND AMAZING PUBLIC SPACES AND THERE'S A LOT OF RESEARCH OUT THERE. USING THAT RESEARCH, USING THAT WORK TO HELP INFORM WHAT WE RECOMMENDED TO YOU TODAY. THE OTHER THING THAT WE WANTED TO JUST END WITH IS THAT, YOU KNOW, WE WERE CHARGED WITH A SPECIFIC TASK AND WE HAD A CERTAIN SCOPE BUT WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE TALKED ABOUT THINGS THAT CAME UP DURING OUR CONVERSATIONS AND DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT CAME UP WAS AFFORDABLE HOUSING, THE NEED FOR MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE DOWNTOWN SPACE, NOT NECESSARILY IN SCOPE, FOR WHAT OUR WORK IS, BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE LET THAT VOICE BE HEARD. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. IT'S A STRONG VOICE IN OUR COMMUNITY. WE JUST WANTED TO RECOGNIZE THAT. AND THEN ANOTHER ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATION IS THAT, YOU KNOW, WE TRIED REALLY HARD, I THINK, TO TRY AND REACH A DIVERSE AUDIENCE OR DIVERSE PERSPECTIVE IN OUR WORK, BUT I'M NOT SURE IF WE ACTUALLY HIT THE MARK. SO AS THIS WORK MOVES FORWARD, HOW DO WE BRING IN MORE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMUNITY, AND MORE DIVERSE PERSPECTIVES INTO THE CONVERSATION ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE SPACE? AND WITH THAT, WE WILL WRAP UP WITH THANK YOUS. SO I'M PERSONALLY GOING TO THANK THE TASK FORCE MEMBERS. WE WERE CHARGED WITH A VERY DIFFICULT TASK AND WE DID IT IN ABOUT EIGHT MONTHS AND 15 MEETINGS. SO I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT HOW THAT GROUP CAME TOGETHER AND I'M SO PROUD OF OUR WORK TOGETHER. I WANT TO THANK HEATHER. WE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN HERE WITHOUT HEATHER'S EXPERTISE AND GUIDANCE AND COUNSELING SORT OF TEAR US IN THE RIGHT DIRECTIONS AS WE PLAN THESE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENTS AND I WANT TO THANK COUNCILMEMBERS SMITH AND HAYNER FOR YOUR GUIDANCE AND HELPING US MOVE THIS WORK TOWARD. AND REALLY THANK THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS FOR ENGAGING IN THIS, FOR PARTICIPATING. SOMETIMES IT GOT A LITTLE HEATED, BUT I THINK IT SHOWS THE CARE AND THE LOVE THAT THE COMMUNITY HAS FOR THAT SPACE. THAT'S ALL WE HAVE. WE CAN ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS.
00:21:06.542: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU SO MUCH. THAT WAS OUTSTANDING. THIS OFTEN IS NOT AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A LOT OF QUESTIONS. THAT TENDS TO BE MORE WORK SESSIONS BUT YOUR WORK PRODUCT FROM THE TASK FORCE IS EXCELLENT. THANK YOU FOR THE WORK YOU DID IN BRINGING IT FORWARD. IT'S A LOT TO MULL OVER. VERY MUCH APPRECIATES. THANK YOU.
00:21:23.793: >> THANK YOU. [ APPLAUSE ]
00:21:34.871: >> Mayor Taylor: WE NOW COME TO PUBLIC COMMENT RESERVE TIME. IT'S TIME FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO SPEAK TO COUNCIL AND THE COMMUNITY ABOUT MATTERS OF MUNICIPAL INTEREST. TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT RESERVE TIME, ONE NEEDS TO SIGN UP IN ADVANCE BY CONTACTING OUR CITY CLERK. SPEAKERS HAVE THREE MINUTES IN WHICH TO SPEAK. SO PLEASE PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE TIME CLOCK. AS' MAAS A MATTER OF COURTESY, Y ONE PERSON MAY SPEAK. OUR FIRST SPEAKER IS:
00:22:11.474: >> I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE POLLUTER PAY ACT WHICH YOU WILL VOTE ON TODAY. BUT BEFORE THAT, YOU WANT TO TELL YOU THAT THIS VIRUS THAT IS COMING IS EXTREMELY, EXTREMELY FAST. BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, THE CAPACITIES OF THE HOSPITAL WILL BE OVERRUN BY THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WILL CATCH THIS AND WE KNOW THE UNITED STATES IS QUITE ILL PREPARED. MANY OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE LESSONS FROM IT. WE SHOULD TAKE THOSE LESSONS. WE NEED FIELD HOSPITALS SET UP RIGHT NOW. DON'T THINK THAT IT IS A REMOTE THING AND WE HAVE A HOSPITAL AND THIS AND THAT. WE HAVE A COUPLE OF HOSPITALS. IT WILL OVERWHELM THEM VERY, VERY, VERY QUICKLY! SO LET US THINK ABOUT THAT AND ACT ON IT. THE OTHER THING I WANTED TO SAY IS THIS:  FOR THE MANY, MANY TIMES THAT I HAVE BEEN HERE, WE NEED TO CLEAN UP THE GELMAN POE HOUSE. WE KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE -- POLLUTION. WE KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE THAT FOR 30 YEARS, WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO MAKE THE POLLUTER PAY. IT'S A GREAT SLOGAN. THE EPA IS THE LEAST EFFECTIVE, LEAST CAPABLE AND LEAST DRIVEN TO PROTECT US THAN IT'S EVER BEEN, UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, WHEN THE SUPERFUND LIST IS BEING DISMANTLED, IT IS -- IT IS SILLY TO THINK THAT THE POLLUTER WILL PAY TO CLEAN UP THE DIOXANE CONTAMINATION. I HOPE EVENTUALLY THEY WILL, BUT WE CANNOT WAIT. WE CANNOT WAIT FOR ANOTHER 30 YEARS. WE CANNOT KICK THE CAN FOR ANOTHER 30 YEARS. WE HAVE TO CLEAN IT UP RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE TO SHOW THE RESPECT TO THE ENVIRONMENT, THE RESPECT THAT WE PRETEND WE HAVE FOR IT. WE HAVE TO SHOW IT. AND WE HAVE TO SHOW IT BY IMMEDIATELY CLEANING IT UP. YOU CANNOT CONTINUE TO PRETEND ANYMORE. IF WE CARE FOR THIS EARTH, IF WE CARE TO CLEAN OUR ENVIRONMENT AND LIVE IN A SUSTAINABLE, HEALTHY, ENVIRONMENT, WE SHOULD PUT THE MONEY WHERE IT DESERVES TO BE. WE SHOULD CLEAN IT UP. WE CAN DO IT. I'M SPEAKING TO PEOPLE ALL OVER ANN ARBOR. EVERYBODY WANTS TO CLEAN IT UP. WHY CAN'T YOU PUT A QUESTION TO THE PUBLIC AND SEE WHAT THEY SAY. WHY CAN'T YOU PUT A MILLAGE TO THE PUBLIC AND SAY, WILL YOU WANT US TO CLEAN IT UP OR NOT? AND LET'S SEE WHAT THEY SAY. AND LISTEN TO THEM. THIS IS AN ENORMOUS EMBARRASSMENT FOR ALL OF US, ALL THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE LIVED IN ANN ARBOR FOR 35 YEARS AND WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO CONTAIN IT, CLEAN IT OR GET RID OF IT. WE HAVE BEEN SPENDING THOUSANDS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON LAWYERS, LITIGATIONS AND STILL IT'S SPREADING.
00:25:09.318: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER --
00:25:10.987: >> CLEAN IT UP NOW! --
00:25:14.423: >> BLAINE COLEMAN.
00:25:15.458: >> YEAH. WELL, AS -- AS MOGDAHN MENTIONED WE NEED THE CITY TO BUILD A FIELD HOSPITAL BECAUSE IT WILL OVERRUN THE EXISTING HOSPITALS. ITALY AND IRELAND ARE DOING IT. ABOUT THE GELMAN RESOLUTION THAT'S IN FRONT OF YOU. IT'S A NICE RESOLUTION. IF I WAS SITTING ON THE CITY COUNCIL, I WOULD VOTE FOR IT. VERY NICE. BUT IT DOES NOT PUT SHOVELS IN THE GROUND. IT DOES NOT CLEAN UP THE DIOXANE CONTAMINATION OF THE CITY AND IT IS NOT INTENDED TO CLEAN UP THE DIOXANE OF THE CITY. THE PREVIOUS PLAN TO HAVE THE EPA DO A STUDY. THE ONLY WAY TO CLEAN IT UP IS IF THE CITY COUGHS UP THE MONEY AND GETS OUT THE SHOVEL AND CLEANS THAT. DIOXANE PLUMEITSELF. IF YOU ARE NOT ABOUT CLEANING IT UP, THEN YOU ARE JUST KICKING THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD FOR ANOTHER 30 YEARS. AND I KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT APPEARING IN FRONT OF THIS CITY COUNCIL AND ASKING THEM TO LISTEN FOR YEARS AND YEARS, AND FINDING THAT THEY DO NOT MEANINGFULLY LISTEN. I BEEN ASKING THAT THE CITY, TAKE SANCTIONS AGAINST ISRAEL, AT LEAST CUT OFF AID TO ISRAEL. THAT WOULD HAVE AN IMPACT WIDER THAN THE CITY AND IT WILL MAKE ISRAEL STOP AND THINK BEFORE IT MASSACRES THOUSANDS MORE PALESTINIANS. DURING THIS CORONAVIRUS RIGHT NOW, VIOLENT ISRAELI SETTLERS ARE RAMPAGING ACROSS THE JORDAN RALLY RIGHT NOW, TERRORIZING PALESTINIAN PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR HOMES AND FARMS IN THE JORDAN VALLEY RIGHT NOW. AND THIS IS WHY THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE ARE STRUGGLING WITH THE CORCORONAVIRUS THEMSELVES. THEY ARE STRUGGLING WITH AN INADEQUATE HOSPITAL SYSTEM. THE GAZA STRIP IS AN ISRAELI PRISON. YOU CAN'T GET OUT OF IT! YOU CAN'T ESCAPE. AND ISRAEL HAS DEVASTATED, NOT JUST THE ECONOMY BUT THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IN GAZA. AS SOON AS THE FIRST PERSON IN THE GAZA STRIP GETS THE CORONAVIRUS, THE WHOLE OF THE GAZA STRIP IS GOING TO BE AFFLICTED IN HORRIBLE WAYS AND YOU NEED TO CUT OFF THE MILITARY AID TO ISRAEL BEFORE THINGS GET WORSE.
00:28:18.307: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS MICHELE HUGHES. MICHELE HUGHES. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS JAMES FOGEL. JAMES FOGEL. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS KIRK WESTPHAL. KIRK WESTPHAL. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS HENRY HERSKOVITZ. ARE THERE COMMUNICATIONS TODAY FROM COUNCIL? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
00:28:50.406: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I JUST HAVE A QUICK QUESTION AND THEN I WANT TO DEFER MY COMMENTS UNTIL MY COLLEAGUES SPEAK. WILL STAFF BE HERE TO ANSWER ANY OF THE QUESTIONS MR. HUPY OR ANYBODY AROUND TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS?
00:29:07.022: >> SOME STAFF IS AVAILABLE IN THE BUILDING. IT DEPENDS ON THE TOPIC. WE HAD SOME PEOPLE WHO COULD NOT STAY. IF YOU HAVE A PARTICULAR TOPIC, I CAN CHECK.
00:29:18.133: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I APPRECIATE IT. I GUESS WE WILL FIND OUT WHEN WE COME TO THOSE QUESTIONS.
00:29:23.939: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
00:29:25.274: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR AND THANK YOU MR. CRAWFORD YOUR COMMENTS ON COVID-19. THANK YOU FOR HAVING SOMEONE THERE WHEN THEY CALL 911 OR WHEN THEY TURN ON THE TAP WATER. ANESTHESIA TEEN ARE UNPRECEDENTED TIMES. IT IS MY HOPE THAT WHEN WE LOOK BACK AT THIS IN SIX MONTHS, IT WILL ALL LOOK AT AN OVERREACTION, SOCIAL DISTANCES AND SELF-ISOLATION AND THAT'S HOW WE'LL KNOW THAT WE ARE SUCCESSFUL, IF WE ARE ABLE TO KEEP DEATH TOLLS LOW AND KEEP OUR HOSPITAL SYSTEMS AT CAPACITY, WE'LL KNOW THAT WE HAVE DONE EVERYTHING WE COULD COLLECTIVELY. BUT NOW MORE THAN EVER, IT'S TIME TO BE A FRIEND AND A NEIGHBOR. SO MAKE SURE YOU ARE CALLING YOUR ELDERLY NEIGHBORS REGULARLY. BASED ON YOUR PARENTS YOUR GRANDPARENTS, TEXT A FRIEND, DONATE TO A LOCAL HOUSING OR FOOD SECURITY NONPROFIT, AND THE MORE WE ARE ABLE TO TAKE THAT COLLECTIVE ACTION, THE BETTER WE'LL GET THROUGH THIS TOGETHER. BUT AS INDIVIDUALS, MAKE SURE YOU LIMIT YOUR CONTACT WITH OTHERS TO A BARE MINIMUM. CLEAN AND DISINPECT COMMONLY TOUCHED SURFACES AND SCRUB YOUR HANDS FOR 20 SECONDS AND AVOID TOUCHING YOUR FACE. AND CALL A HEALTH PROFESSIONAL IF YOU EXPERIENCE, A FEVER, COUGH OR SHORTNESS OF BREATH AND IF YOU DO ORDER FROM A DOWNTOWN RESTAURANT, MAKE SURE YOU TIP WELL.
00:30:55.764: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU FOR THOSE COMMENTS. I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATELY TO SAY THOSE THINGS FROM THE BENCH UP HERE. THIS IS A DEFINITE -- A NEW SITUATION FOR EVERYBODY HERE AND I KNOW THAT CITY STAFF HAS BEEN WORKING HARD BEHIND THE SCENES AND A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN REACHING OUT TO US PRIVATELY AND ON SOCIAL MEDIA, WHAT ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE CAN DO AS A CITY AND IN SOME SENSE OUR AUTHORITY IS LIMITED AND IN SOME SENSE, IT'S QUITE BROAD. AND I THINK WE ARE DOING THE IMPORTANT THINGS THAT WE CAN AS A CITY. I KNOW THAT THE STATE HAS SOME EMERGENCY ORDERS OUT THERE THAT ARE -- THE EFFORT IS TO INCREASE SOCIAL DISTANCES AND LIMIT LARGE GATHERINGS. IT'S DIFFICULT. IT'S DIFFICULT FOR THE SMALL BUSINESSES THAT WOULD NORMALLY BE THE GATHERING PLACE AND IT'S DIFFICULT FOR SOME FOLKS IN OUR COMMUNITY TO UNDERSTAND THAT, YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULDN'T BE 600 PEOPLE AT A HOUSE PARTY BECAUSE CLASSES ARE CANCELED. I WOULD URGE FOLKS OUT IN THE COMMUNITY TO HEED THE ADVICE FROM THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS, FROM THE THINGS YOU FIND FROM THE CITY AND THE THINGS YOU SEE FROM THE CDC. IT'S NOT AN OVER REACTION TO GET AHEAD OF THIS. IT IS NOT AN OVERREACTION TO PRACTICE THE SOCIAL DISTANCING. IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL. I SAW -- I WAS TALKING TO A WOMAN, AND, YOU KNOW, WE'RE A LITTLE TOO OLD FOR THIS BUT THEY CANCELED SCHOOL FOR A YEAR WHEN EVERYBODY HAD POLIO, RIGHT? AND SO YOU CAN GET OVER IT. YOU CAN REACH OUT TO YOUR NEIGHBORS AND HOPEFULLY THE SCHOOL SYSTEM WILL STEP UP LIKE THEY HAVE BEEN, THE LIBRARIES AND EVERYBODY ELSE AND WE'LL ALL WORK TOGETHER AND DOT BEST WE -O THE BEST WE CAN. A LOST SUCCESS COUNTS ON THE INDIVIDUALS' EFFORTS IN THIS CASE. AND SO WE HAVE TO ACT INDIVIDUALLY AND WE HAVE TO CARE AS A COMMUNITY AND I HOPE THAT MESSAGE GETS OUT THERE, AND SHARE IT WITH EVERYBODY ELSE. BE CLEAN AND WASH YOUR HANDS, PLEASE.
00:32:41.703: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
00:32:42.604: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. IN ADDITION TO ALL THE CITY STAFF WHO HAVE BEEN WORKING SO HARD, I ALSO -- I THINK THAT'S BEEN STATED AND I CERTAINLY HAVE TREMENDOUS APPRECIATION FOR BASIC SERVICES. I THINK SANITATION WAS ONE THAT WASN'T MENTIONED EITHER, BUT CLEARLY, IT WOULD GET VERY OUT OF HAND, ESPECIALLY WITH SO MANY PEOPLE SHELTERING IN PLACE OR CREATING PROBABLY MORE GARBAGE AND RECYCLING AT HOME AND USING MORE WATER. AND SO JUST TREMENDOUS APPRECIATION FOR THAT. ALSO FOR OUR PARTNERS, I WANT TO MENTION THAT THE COUNTY AND STATE, THERE WERE THINGS THAT AS WE WERE LOOKING AND HEARING COMMENTS THAT MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T BE HOLDING THIS MEETING, I THOUGHT WE PLAY HAVE TO COME TOGETHER AS A COUNCIL TO APPROVE BUT FORTUNATELY EITHER AT THE COUNTY LEVEL, THE SCHOOL LEVEL, STATE LEVEL, THEY WERE GETTING AHEAD OF US. A CERTAIN NUMBER OF OCCASIONS CERTAINLY TODAY WITH BARS AND RESTAURANTS, YOU KNOW, MOVING TO TAKEOUT AND DELIVERY ONLY. THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WE MIGHT HAVE HAD TO ACT ON THIS EVENING, BUT THE GOVERNOR WAS A STEP AHEAD OF US. AND I DO HAVE TREMENDOUS FEAR FOR OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY, WHERE THEY ARE LED BY GOVERNORS THAT DON'T BELIEVE IN SCIENCE, DON'T GO OUT AND, YOU KNOW -- WE FORTUNATELY OUR PRIMARY WAS DONE BUT THESE ELECTIONS, THEY DO MATTER. I WANT TO THANK THE CITY LEADERSHIP, THE MAYOR FOR HAVING A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS BEHIND THE SCENES AND BEING RESPONSIVE, TO ME, THE SAME WITH THE CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE, WHEN I HEARD CONCERNS ABOUT PEOPLE BEING EVICTED AND THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING ABLE TO KEEP PEOPLE IN THEIR HOMES. WHAT I BROUGHT UP THAT ISSUE, IT WAS RESPONDED TO VERY QUICKLY BY OUR COURTS AND CITY LEADERSHIP. SO I KEY WE HAVE REPRESENTATION FROM THE D.D.A. JUST ALL OF THE ACTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN IN OUR COMMUNITY, I REALLY APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT I -- THAT I GET TO LIVE HERE. SO PLEASE DO -- I KNOW IT SEEMS IRONIC FOR US TO BE TELLING PEOPLE TO SOCIALLY DISTANCE THEMSELVES FROM THIS PLACE, AND I HOPE THAT WE WILL BE LOOKING FOR WAYS THAT WE CAN MEET REMOTELY AS WELL, NOW THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS ISSUED THAT ORDER.
00:34:53.468: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
00:34:54.336: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. AND I TOO WOULD LIKE TO THANK MR. CRAWFORD AND HIS ENTIRE TEAM FOR GOING, YOU KNOW, FULL BORE, SINCE THE PANDEMIC HAS STRUCTURE OUR COMMUNITY WITH ALL THE ASSOCIATED CONCERNS THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ATTEMPTING TO ADDRESS, AND YOU QUICKLY ASSEMBLED AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT TEAM AND THE COLLABORATION WITH THE COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT, THE U OF M, ALL THE HOSPITALS, RED CROSS, ON AND ON, HAS BEEN EXCEPTIONAL. AND AS YOU SAID IN ONE OF YOUR -- I THINK YOU SENT US A DOZEN UPDATES, I SORTED BY YOUR NAME IN MY EMAIL, AND WORKING WEEKENDS ON AND ON. THE -- YOU CREDIT THE STAFF THEIR COMMITMENT AND FOR BEING PROFESSIONAL, PROACTIVE, CREATIVE, YOU KNOW, PLUG IN THE ACCLOUACCOLADE AND THEY HAVE BEN DOING ALL OF THAT AND YOUR PERSPECTIVES ON OPERATIONS AND YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS AND -- AND AS YOU DID TONIGHT, GIVING US A HEADS UP ON THE BUDGET CHALLENGES THAT WILL LIKELY ENSHOE AS A RESULT OF ALL OF -- ENSHOE AS A RESULT OF ALL OF THIS ARE GREATLY APPRECIATED. IT ALLOWS US TO SHARE INFORMATION WITH THE BROADER COMMUNITY AND I KNOW THAT'S BEEN APPRECIATED BY MANY AND PEOPLE HAVE BEEN REACHING OUT TO US, AS -- FOR SUGGESTIONS ON, AMONG OTHER THINGS HOW WE CAN HELP. WE HAVE AN INCREDIBLE COMMUNITY, AND AS IS NOTED, I WOULD COMMEND THE CITY WEB PAGE ON -- TO GET THESE COVID-19 UPDATES. THE CITY'S WEB PAGE IS OUTSTANDING AND YOU HAVE LINKS THIS TO CDC AND THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AND LOTS OF GOOD INFORMATION FOR PEOPLE. SO THANK YOU FOR THAT AS WELL. AND JUST IN GENERAL, THE WASHTENAW COUNTY UNITED WAY HAS ORGANIZED A WASHTENAW CORONAVIRUS VOLUNTEER RESPONSE TEAM, AND AS HAS BEEN NOTED, THEY NEED MEDICAL AND NONMEDICAL VOLUNTEERS. AND SO THANK YOU AS WELL FOR PROVIDING THAT LINK FOR OUR COMMUNITY. SO WE WILL GET THROUGH THIS, AND I JUST APPRECIATE THE LEADERSHIP THAT'S BEEN PROVIDED THROUGHOUT AND I SEE MS. POLLY HERE, THE D.D.A. STEPPING UP ALSO SO HELP OUR -- YOU KNOW, WE ARE ALL ALSO VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPACT OPEN THE SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITY. WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THIS COMMUNITY -- IT'S GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT. AND SO FINDING WAYS TO ASSIST -- TO LESSEN THIS ECONOMIC IMPACT, IF THERE'S ANY WAY TO DO THAT, ALL OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS, SUGGESTIONS AND ACTIONS ARE GREATLY APPRECIATED. THANK YOU.
00:38:00.489: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER COMMUNICATION FROM COUNCIL? OH, COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
00:38:04.459: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. AND APPRECIATE ALL THE WORDS THAT WERE SPOKEN ABOUT THE CURRENT STATE OF AFFAIRS. I APPRECIATE STAFF'S RESPONSE IN THIS GALVANIZING MINUTE AND THIS GALVANIZING MOMENT, IN THIS. THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR HAS BEEN VERY AGILE. WE HAVE BEEN GETTING CALLS AN EMAILS AND TEXTS AND ASKING US FOR ACTION TO BE TAKEN. IN EACH OF THOSE CASES WHETHER IT WAS WATER SHUTOFFS OR THE EVICTIONS, BY THE TIME WE TALKED TO OUR CITY ADMINISTRATOR, ACTION HAD ALREADY BEEN TAKEN ON THEM. WE ALSO HAVE SEEN ACTION TAKEN BY THE D.D.A. TODAY TO HELP THE SITUATION DOWNTOWN, FOR THE MERCHANTS AND EVERYONE ELSE AFFECTED BY IT. SO I APPRECIATE THE CITY'S WISDOM AND ACTION TAKEN. CALMER HEADS PREVAIL IN MOMENTS LIKE THIS AND TO THIS POINT, WE HAVE PASSED THE TEST. BUT LET'S NOT BE FOOLED. THE HARDEST PART IS YET TO COME. I KNOW AS A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER IN DOWNTOWN, WE ARE EFFECTIVELY CLOSED AND HAVE A SEMBLANCE OF AN ORGANIZATION FOR THE COMMUNITY, TO PROVIDE FOODS FOR THOSE WHO CAN'T PROVIDE IT FOR THEMSELVES, BUT WE HAVE ADHERED TO THE STATE ORDERS AND THANKFULLY HAVE THE READERSHIP IN THE STATE AND THE COUNTY. PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ASKING WHAT THE CITY HAS BEEN DOING. THE CITY HAS BEEN WORKING LIKE ANY OTHER ORGANIZATION TRYING TO FIND NEW NORMALS EVERY DAY. THINGS KEEP MOVING. THINGSKEEP CHANGING. THERE IS NO PLAN -- THE PLAN IS ABOUT AS GOOD AS ABOUT 24 HOURS. THE PLANS KEEP CHANGING. SO I APPRECIATE, AGAIN, PUTTING IN THE TIME, THE WORK IT'S TAKEN. IT'S NOT A 9 TO 5. IT'S A 24/7. I AP APPRECIATE THE CALLS AND TE EMAILS AND THE UPDATES, BUT, AGAIN, IT'S JUST STARTED. I BELIEVE -- I HOPE I COULD GET MORE THAN THREE MINUTES. I ENDORSED BERNIE SANDERS AS A PRESIDENT AND HIS SLOGAN TOWARDS THE END, IT'S NOT ABOUT ME, IT'S ABOUT US. I REALLY WANT TO CONVEY THAT SENTIMENT. WE ARE IN THIS TOGETHER. WE'RE IN THE SAME BOAT. SO HOPEFULLY WE REALIZE THAT AND WE FIRST ADDRESSED THOSE WHO ARE THE MOST VULNERABLE, THE MOST IN NEED, AND RECOGNIZE THE HEROIC EFFORTS BEING PUT FORTH BY THE PEOPLE ON THE FRONT LINE. THE MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS, WHO ARE PAYING A DEAR PRICE, SOME OF THEM. AND, OF COURSE, THE ELDERLY. AND THOSE WHO HAVE MEDICAL COMPLICATIONS. SO I URGE OUR RESIDENTS TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES BUT ALSO TO BE COGNIZANT OF THE FOLKS WHO ARE MOST VULNERABLE FIRST. ALLOW THE RESOURCES TO BE ADDRESSED AND DIRECTED TO THOSE WHO CAN USE IT AND NEED IT THE MOST. I BELIEVE, YOU KNOW, MARCH 11th WILL GO DOWN IN INFAMY. THAT'S WHEN THE WORLD CHANGED FOR ME, AS A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER. AND I THINK AT THIS TIME, I WOULD ASK THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR AND MY COLLEAGUES THAT WE FORM A TASK FORCE SO WE CAN DEAL WITH THE CULTURAL, SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC INSTITUTIONS THAT MAKE UP OUR CITY, SO WE CAN COMMUNICATE WITH THOSE ORGANIZATIONS, UNILATERALLY WITH A CLEAR VOICE AND A CLEAR DIRECTION AND WE CAN APPLY THE RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE TO THE PROBLEMS BECAUSE THE PROBLEMS ARE GOING TO BE MANY, AND THE RESOURCES ARE GOING TO BE FEW. AND I'M JUST CONCERNED THAT WE MAY RUN OUT OF ARE E SOURCES AND WISH WE -- RESOURCES AND WISH WE DID THINGS IN DIFFERENT ORDERS. SO I THINK WE NEED TO TREE IT LIKE -- TREAT IT LIKE A TRIAGE AND FIGURE OUT WHAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. IT IS MY OPINION THAT WE HAVE JUST ENTERED A RECESSION AND WE NEED TO TREAT THIS AS IF WE ARE IN A RECESSION. ECONOMIC FORECASTS ARE 6% CONTRACT -- IT'S GOING TO SHRINK BY 6% IN THE NEXT QUARTER. THESE ARE REAL NUMBERS, AS WELL AS WITH THE HEALTH EFFECTS, THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC FALLOUT. SO, AGAIN, I WILL URGE THAT WE PUT A TASK FORCE TOGETHER TO HELP ADDRESS WHAT COMES NEXT.
00:43:18.606: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
00:43:20.275: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. IN THE -- I JUST REALIZED THAT WE PULLED DC-6 FROM THE AGENDA AND I WAS HOPING THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR COULD TALK THROUGH WHAT WE CAN DO BETWEEN NOW AND APRIL 6th TO HELP THE HOUSING COMMISSION TO CLOSE ANY GAPS TO PREVENT ANY HOUSING EVICTIONS.
00:43:45.700: >> City Admin. Crawford: I NOTICED THE SAME THING. DC-6 IS WHERE THEY INDICATED THEY THINK THEY WILL FACE SOME CHALLENGES WITH EVICTIONS FROM THE RESIDENTS AS INCOMES ARE REDUCED DURING THIS TIME. BECAUSE WE DO NOT HAVE A QUORUM OR THE EIGHT VOTE WHICH IS NEEDED FOR THAT ITEM, I WILL TRY TO ADDRESS THAT PRIOR TO OUR NEXT MEETING IN ANY MANNER THAT I CAN. AND I DO NOT HAVE THOSE ACTIONS TO DISCUSS TODAY, BUT I WILL BE WORKING WITH THEM WITHIN THE POWERS THAT I HAVE.
00:44:17.899: >> Councilmember Ackerman: OKAY. PLEASE LET US KNOW HOW WE CAN HELP.
00:44:22.637: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER COMMUNICATIONS FROM COUNCIL? I WOULD LIKE TO RECOMMEND CONFIRMATION OF THE FOLLOWING APPOINTMENT PRESENTED TO THE CITY COUNCIL AT THE MARCH 2 REGULAR SESSION MEETING, TO THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION, BRETT HAUTAMAKI. MOVED BY ACKERMAN AND SECONDED BY RAMMY LAW. DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. I HAVE A COUPLE OF ANNOUNCEMENTS WITH RESPECT TO WORK SESSIONS. THE APRIL 13 WORK SESSION IS CANCELED AND WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT THOSE -- THAT IS INCORPORATED INTO THE FUTURE SESSIONS. WITH RESPECT TO THE 3/23 AND 3/30 BUDGET WO WORK SESSIONS THE MEETINGS AS PUBLIC MEETINGS ARE CANCELED DUE DO COVID BUT THERE'S ONLINE PRESENTATIONS THAT WILL BE VIEWABLE BY COUNCIL AT THE SCHEDULED TIMES AS WELL AS THE PUBLIC. SO WE'LL PRETEND WE ARE HERE. WE WILL HEAR THE STAFF AND THEY WILL BE ABLE TO SPEAK TO US AND, YOU KNOW, WE WILL BE AI BELIEVE TO GET QUESTION -- BE ABLE TO GET QUESTIONS AND PRESENT TO THE PUBLIC AS A WHOLE AND WE REDUCE FOLKS COMING ON IN.
00:45:29.504: >> Councilmember Hayner:  IF I MAY? SO I HAVE HAD A QUESTION ABOUT THAT, BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE ASKED HOW CAN WE GET TOGETHER? HOW CAN WE DO THINGS LIKE -- WELL, LIKE I HAD SCHEDULED A GROUP OF FOLKS WOULD WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE TINY HOUSE CONCEPT TO H HELP OUR HOMELESS COMMUNITY. THAT WAS THIS MORNING WITH THE REGULAR OFFICE HOUR. IS THERE ANY ABILITY FOR THE CITY TO PROVIDE US WITH LIKE A PARTY LINE, 800 NUMBER CALL-IN SITUATION. DO WE HAVE TOOLS LIKE THAT AVAILABLE TO US AS PUBLIC, YOU KNOW, REPRESENTATIVES TO HELP FACILITATE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE WOULD BE DOING IN PERSON, HAVING OUR COFFEE HOURS AND MEETINGS AND STUFF LIKE THAT.
00:46:11.646: >> City Admin. Crawford: I CAN LOOK INTO THAT. STAFF HAS SOME BRIDGE LINES, AND I CAN LOOK AT THAT.
00:46:18.486: >> Councilmember Hayner:  WE HAD THE ONE MEETING, WHERE WE HAD THE ZOOM MEETING, AND WE TALKED ABOUT OUR -- THE ONE COUNTY INITIATIVES THAT WE WERE WORKING ON WE USED A ZOO. PLATFORM. I JUST WONDERED IF YOU COULD FILL IN ON ACCESS. I THINK THAT WOULD HELP A LOT OF US OUT. THANK YOU.
00:46:40.408: >> Mayor Taylor: THOSE -- OH, NEXT, I WOULD LIKE TO RECOMMEND THE FOLLOWING NOMINATION FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION, TO THE HOUSING BOARD OF APPEALS, TIMOTHY DURHAM. AND THEN CLOSING, BEFORE GETTING TO THE BALANCE OF THE AGENDA, I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH THE PUBLIC ABOUT WHO COVID-19 MEANS FOR ANN ARBOR AND WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A GOOD COMMUNITY MEMBER WHILE WE RESPOND TO THIS PANDEMIC. THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR'S MISSION AS FOLKS KNOW IS TO DELIVER EXCEPTIONAL SERVICES THAT SUSTAIN AND ENHANCE A VIBRANT AND SAFE COMMUNITY. THIS MISSION IS ESPECIALLY CRITICAL TODAY AS WE WORK TO SUPPORT OUR COMMUNITY, WHAT IS -- DURING WHAT IS AN UNPRECEDENTED PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. AS FOLKS KNOW AND I HAVE ALLUDED TODAY, GOVERNOR GRETCHEN WITMER SIGNED A STATEWIDE EXECUTIVE ORDER THIS TEMPORARY CLOSES THEATERS, BARS, GYMS, RECREATION CENTERS, GYMS STATEWIDE AND LIMITS ESTAURANTS TO CARRYOUT AND DELIVERY ORDERS. THIS RUNS THROUGH MARCH 30. THE ORDER DOES NOT APPLY TO OFFICE BUILDINGS, GROCERY STORES, FOOD PANTRIES, PHARMACIES OR MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION CENTERS. I WOULD URGE EVERYONE IN OUR COMMUNITY TO HEED THIS EXECUTIVE ORDER, AND TO FOLLOW CDC SOCIAL DISTANCING RECOMMENDATIONS. YOU HAVE HEARD THEM BY NOW, BUT THEY BEAR REPEATING. 6 FEET DISTANCE BETWEEN PEOPLE, PROPER HYGIENE SUCH AS WASHING YOUR HANDS WITH SOAP AND WATER FOR 20 SECONDS, COVERING YOUR SNEEZE AND AVOIDING CONTACT WITH PERSONS WHO ARE SICK OR IF YOU YOURSELF ARE EXHIBITING SYMPTOMS. WE NEED TO KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT A SNOW DAY. YOU KNOW, SCHOOL IS NOT OUT FOR SUMMER. AND THAT MEANS THAT EVERYONE, THE YOUNG, THE OLD, AND PEOPLE IN BETWEEN, EVERYONE IN BETWEEN, NEEDS TO TAKE RIGOROUS RIGOROUS PREVENTATIVE MEASURES BY STAYING HOME WHENEVER POSSIBLE, AVOIDING CONGREGATING IN HOMES, IN MAY PY GROUNDS OR PARKS. WE INTO NEED TO LOWER OUR COMMUS EXPOSURE TO THE VIRUS. DILIGENT ACTION WILL SAVE LIVES. BEGINNING ON MARCH 17th, AS HAS BEEN ANNOUNCED, WE WILL BE CLOSING CITY HALL AND CITY OF ANN ARBOR BUILDINGS, AND NONCRITICAL SERVICES. THIS IS GOING TO RUN THROUGH APRIL 5th. WHERE POSSIBLE, STAFF WILL WORK REMOTELY. AND THEY WILL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE SERVICES THEREBY AND I WANT MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC, I WANT TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO CONDUCT CITY BUSINESS ONLINE WHENEVER POSSIBLE. THERE WILL BE SOME SLOWDOWNS AND NONESSENTIAL SERVICES BUT I WANT FOLKS TO BE ASSURED THAT THESE MEASURES WILL NOT IMPACT CRITICAL SERVICE DELIVERY SUCH AS DRINKING WATER, WASTEWATER, POLICE, FIRE, TRASH, AND RECYCLING PICKUP. UNDER ALL CIRCUMSTANCES, THESE SERVICES WILL CONTINUE. OUR EMERGENCY OPERATIONS TEAM WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO COORDINATE WITH THE STATE, LOCAL AGENCIES, THE WASHTENAW COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND WE WILL ADDITIONAL STEPS IF NECESSARY NO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITY AND SLOW THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS. THIS HAS BEEN UNPRECEDENTED TIMES. I HAVE BEEN IN FAIR, CONSTANT CONTACT WITH CITY STAFF AS THEY WORK TO ENSURE SAFETY OF THE COMMUNITY AND -- AND FRANKLY, I HAVE BEEN AMAZED AND GRATEFUL FOR WHAT I HAVE SEEN. STAFF HAS UP AND DOWN RESPONDED TO THIS -- TO THIS CRISIS. THEY HAVE DONE SO WITH DILIGENCE AND CARE AND SPEED, AND FORETHOUGHT AND IT'S JUST -- IT'S BEEN SOMETHING ELSE. AND SO THE NEXT TIME YOU SEE A CITY WORKER, AS YOU ARE OUT AND ABOUT IN THE PUBLIC, WHETHER THEY ARE IN A VEHICLE OR ON THE STREET, WHETHER THEY ARE IN POLICE CAR OR FIRE TRUCK, I MEAN, GIVE THEM A WAVE. MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC, YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT THE STAFF OF THE CITY IS HERE TO WORK FOR US IN THE WORST OF TIMES. AND THEY ARE EARNING OUR THANKS. WITH RESPECT TO INDIVIDUALS, I WOULD SAY THAT THERE IS A LOT OF INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE CITY, WITH RESPECT TO THE MUNICIPAL ORGANIZATION AND YOU CAN ALWAYS FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON AT A2GOV.ORG/COVID-19, THERE YOU WILL LEARN WHAT'S GOING ON WITH RESPECT TO OUR ORGANIZATION, INFORMATION FROM THE COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT, AS WELL AS -- AND THIS HAS BEEN ALLUDED TO BY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC, VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO COMMUNITY ACTIVITIES. WE HAVE A LOT OF FOLKS IN NEED IN OUR COMMUNITY, A LOT OF BUSINESSES IN NEED IN OUR COMMUNITY, A LOT OF INDIVIDUALS IN NEED IN OUR COMMUNITY AND WE ALSO HAVE AGENCIES AND ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE POISED TO HELP. AND YOU AS MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC CAN GO TO OUR WEBSITE, FIND SOME -- FIND SOME POINTS OF ENTRY AND DO YOUR PART. AND FINALLY, I GUESS I ALSO WANT TO SAY TOO, THAT MYSELF AM PARTICULARLY PROUD OF THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE. AS COUNCILMEMBERS HERE HAVE ALLUDED AND AS MENTIONED, SO MANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC, YOU HAVE DEMONSTRATED HOW YOU CARE FOR EACH OTHER DURING THESE EXTRAORDINARY TIMES. WHAT I'M DOING IS I'M ASKING FOR YOUR CONTINUED COURAGE AND YOUR CONTINUED PATIENCE AND YOUR FURTHER COMMITMENT TO DO EVERYTHING THAT YOU CAN IN YOUR POWER TO HELP STOP THE SPREAD OF THIS V VIRUS. IT'S MY OPINION THAT THE COMMUNITY OF ANN ARBOR HAS RAISE TONE THIS WIND CHILL -- RISEN TO THIS CHALLENGE AND OUR FUNDAMENTAL VALUES OF EQUITY, FRIENDSHIP AND NEIGHBORLINESS AND WE WILL MEET THIS CHALLENGE WITH KINDNESS, DETERMINATION AND RESOLVE. IN ANN ARBOR, WE CARE FOR OURSELVES AND WE CARE FOR EACH OTHER, AND FRANKLY, I THINK WE ARE ALL GOING TO GET THROUGH THIS TOGETHER. SO THANK YOU, AND WE'RE GOING TO GET ON WITH THE BUSINESS OF COUNCIL. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO DOING YOUR WORK TONIGHT. WE NOW HAVE BEFORE US THE CONSENT AGENDA. MAY I HAVE A MOTION TO APPROVE THE CONSENT AGENDA. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRAND? DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
00:52:35.796: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: COULD I PULL THE FOLLOWING: CA-14, CA-19, AND CA-20?
00:52:48.109: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
00:52:50.311: >> Councilmember Lumm: I DON'T HAVE ANY ITEMS TO PULL OUT I WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT ON CA-5, THE PARK DONATION, FORMERLY WOODBURY CLUB APARTMENTS AND THE CA RIFF 16, THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE PURCHASES. CA RIFF 5 IS TO ACCEPT THE PARK LAND DONATION FROM THE WOODBURY CLUB APARTMENTS NOW CALLED THE ANNEX DEVELOPERS. DONATION WAS PART OF THE DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT APPROVED BACK IN 2016, AND MY COMMENT RELATES TO A RESPONSE TO ONE OF MY QUESTIONS. I ASKED IF THIS DEVELOPER, AND THE NIXON FARMS DEVELOPER WOULD BE CONTRIBUTING FUNDING FOR THE NIXON CORRIDOR IMPROVEMENT PROJECT AND THE RESPONSE WAS THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE CONTRIBUTING ANY FUNDING. BOTH DEVELOPERS HAD CONTRIBUTED TO THE NIXON GREEN DUSAN, I THOUGHT IT WOULD INCLUDE THE --
00:53:41.495: >> Mayor Taylor: I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT YOU. THIS HAS BEEN PULLED FROM THE AGENDA.
00:53:51.272: >> Councilmember Lumm: CA-5.
00:53:51.872: >> Mayor Taylor: NO WORRIES. I SHOULD HAVE REALIZED THAT WHEN YOU ADDRESSED IT.
00:53:55.109: >> Councilmember Lumm: SO THIS WILL COME BACK.
00:53:58.012: >> Mayor Taylor: AS WELL AS 16.
00:53:59.547: >> Councilmember Lumm: HOW ABOUT CA-6.
00:54:08.689: >> Mayor Taylor: 6 HAS NOT BEEN PULLED.
00:54:11.926: >> Councilmember Lumm: OKAY. SO THE ONE BEFORE US THEN OF THESE THREE IS JUST CA-6, SORRY. MY APOLOGIES. I DIDN'T GO BACK TO CHECK WHAT REQUIRING VOTES.
00:54:21.602: >> Mayor Taylor: NO WORRIES.
00:54:23.170: >> Councilmember Lumm: SO POSITIVE COMMENT THEN ON CA-6. WHICH IS THE RESOLUTION TO ACCEPT THE GRANT FROM THE A.A. ANN ARBOR YPSILANTI LOCAL DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY FOR THE FIBER OPTIC AND CONDUIT INSTALLATION IN THE D.D.A. DOWNTOWN. THIS IS A BIG DEAL AND THE GRANT FROM THE LDFA IS FOR UP TO $5 MILLION, WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY SIGNIFICANT AND THIS IS ALSO GREAT TO SEE. FOR THOSE FOLKS WHO HAVE BEEN AROUND, THIS IS SOMETHING THAT FORMER COUNCILMEMBER, KAILASAPATHY AND I PUSHED FOR. WE WERE AWARE THAT NONE OF THE DOLLARS WERING FOR INFRASTRUCTURE AND CAPITAL. WE WERE TOLD IT WAS COMING AND SURE ENOUGH IT'S HERE. SO THIS IS VERY ENCOURAGING AND EXCITING AND I -- I TEND MY THANKS --Y EXTEND MY THANKS TO CITY STAFF AND THE LDFA FOLKS FOR MAKING THIS HAPPEN.
00:55:20.561: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
00:55:21.495: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU. I WAS -- I WOULD LIKE TO PULL CA-19 AND I HAD A COMMENT ON 6 ALSO.
00:55:28.702: >> Mayor Taylor: CA-19 HAS BEEN PULLED. CA-6, IS ALL YOURS.
00:55:32.273: >> Councilmember Hayner:  SO JUST TO COMMENT ON SIX. MY QUESTION IS WHEN I FIRST SAW THIS WAS:  YOU KNOW, WHO IS PAYING FOR THIS AND WOULD BENEFITS FROM THIS? THIS IS A DOWNTOWN CENTERED THING. THAT'S WELL AN GOOD BECAUSE THAT'S A WHERE A LOT OF OUR HIGH TECH IS. WITH THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS HAD SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THIS NOTION THAT THERE WERE CONCERNS ABOUT CANCELING THE SCHOOLS AND, OF COURSE, THAT DIDN'T COME OUT BECAUSE PEOPLE DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS IN HIGH-SPEED INTERNET TO HOMES IN THE COMMUNITY, NOT DOWNTOWN BUT EVERYWHERE ELSE IN THE COMMUNITY. AND SO I GUESS MY HOPE ON THIS IS THAT THIS ACTS AS SOME KIND OF CORE STRUCTURE OR BACKBONE OF SOMETHING WE CAN EXTEND TO THE REST OF THE COMMUNITY IN THE NOT TOO DISTANT FUTURE SO WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THINGS LIKE DISTANCE LEARNING THAT FOLKS MIGHT NOT HAVE EQUITABLE ACCESS TO THE INTERNET AND SO ON OUT IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS, AND I APPRECIATE THAT THIS BENEFITS THE DOWNTOWN AND THE CORE. DOWNTOWN BUSINESSES AND SO ON, AND THE CITY ITSELF, BUT I JUST WANT TO SEE THESE KINDS OF THINGS EXTENDED OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY IN A -- IN A WAY THAT IS, YOU KNOW, KIND OF BENEFITS THE CITY AS A WHOLE. THANK YOU.
00:56:44.411: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE CONSENT AGENDA? AS AMENDED.
00:56:49.016: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I WILL RESPOND TO CA-6, I DO SIT ON THE LDFA BOARD, WHICH HAS BEEN TALKED ABOUT SINCE I JOINED THE BOARD ABOUT A YEAR AGO. THERE'S A LOT OF REQUIREMENTS AND RESTRICTIONS ON THE FUNDING AND WHERE AND HOW IT CAN BE SPENT. EFFECTIVELY, THERE'S A HEALTHY FUND BALANCE AND IT NEEDS TO BE SPENT ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. AND IF WE DON'T, I BELIEVE WE RISK LOSING IT. SO THIS IDEA TO LAY FIBER HERE IS JUST -- IT SEEMS TO BE THE BEST WAY TO USE THOSE FUNDS AND A WAY TO FURTHER OUR CITY MAKING IT A TOP CITY IN THE STATE, AND PERHAPS IN THE NATION, WHEN IT COMES TO CONNECTIVITY, BECOMING A SMART CITY, KNOWING WHEN OUR STREETLIGHTS ARE OUT WHEN OUR SIGNALS ARE OUT, KNOWING WHAT'S GOING ON IN OUR CITY IN REALTIME, WITH AN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE OWN. AND ALSO HAS THE BENEFITS, OBVIOUSLY, FOR PRIVATE -- PRIVATE ENTERPRISE AS WELL. SO I WOULD LEAVE -- MR. CRAWFORD IS HERE, AND HE KNOWS QUITE A BIT ABOUT THIS, AND IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT HE WOULD LIKE TO ADD ON IT, BUT JUST ON THE 30,000-FOOT LEVEL, THIS DOES SEEM TO BE A WISE INVESTMENT, AND I'M COMFORTED TO KNOW THAT MY COLLEAGUES, COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, AT LEAST, IS IN SUPPORT OF IT. WE HADN'T REALLY TALKED ABOUT THIS AS A BODY AND TO KNOW IT HAS THE SUPPORTS OF THE MEMBERS LIKE COUNCILMEMBER LUMM IS SIGNIFICANT.
00:58:32.886: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR OF THE CONSENT AGENDA AS PULLED AND AMENDED, SAY AYE. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? THE CONSENT AGENDA IS APPROVED WITH THE EXCEPTION OF -- WELL, THIS IS IS GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CA-5, CA-8, CA-10, CA-14, 19 AND 20, CA16, CA-17, CA-18, CA-14. RESOLUTION TO APPROVE A BEST COURSE BIG BELLY SOLAR INC. FOR LEASE OF SOLAR COMPACTING TRASH AND RECYCLING CONTAINERS, NOT TO EXCEED $150,000. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI AND SECONDED BY ACKERMAN. DISCUSSION OF CA-14. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
00:59:25.706: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: APPRECIATE IT. WITH EVERYTHING GOING ON, I DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO PUT IN ANY QUESTIONS. AND I MISSED AN OPPORTUNITY, BUT MR. HUPY IS HERE AND PERHAPS HE CAN ANSWER FOR ME. THIS CALLS FOR TEN CONTAINERS FOR FIVE YEARS BUDGET, TOTAL AMOUNT OF $550,000. I'M JUST CURIOUS AS TO KNOW WHERE THEY ARE GOING TO BE PLACED. IS THIS A PART OF A BIGGER PROGRAM? JUST TO ME, IT SEEMS LIKE WE ARE SPENDING A LOT OF MONEY AND JUST TO GET A BETTER SENSE OF THE DIRECTION THAT THIS IS GOING.
01:00:04.378: >> CRAIG HUPY PUBLIC SERVICES ADMINISTRATOR AREA. I WILL START OFF AT THE VERY HIGH LEVEL BUT MOLLY IS HERE TO TALK ABOUT SPECIFIC CITINGS. WE ALREADY HAVE SOME OF THESE CONTAINERS IN OUR DOWNTOWN AREA AND WE DO KNOW THEY FUNCTION. THE PLAN IS TO PUT THEM IN THE -- WHAT WE WOULD CALL HIGH-VOLUME AREAS, WHERE THE CONTAINERS GET USED, AND WHAT THEY -- THESE CONTAINERS ALLOW US TO DO IS NOT HAVE TO SERVICE THEM UNTIL THEY NEED TO BE SERVICED. SO WE DON'T MAKE UNNECESSARY TRIPS OUT TO THE CONTAINERS, AND ON THAT, I WILL LET MOLLY TALK ABOUT SPECIFICS.
01:00:49.089: >> THANK YOU. SO WE HAVE TEN SETS THAT WE HAVE ORDERED OR WILL BE ORDERING IF THIS GETS APPROVED AND WE WILL PUT THEM AT OUR HIGHEST PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC LOCATIONS AND WE WILL POSITION THEM ON OPPOSITE CORNERS AND THEY ACTUALLY CAN HOLD ABOUT FOUR TIMES THE AMOUNT THAT A REGULAR -- THE TRADITIONAL PEDESTRIAN CANS CAN HANDLE. AND THEY COMPACT AND THEY ARE SOLAR OPERATED. SO THEY WILL HOLD MUCH MORE AND SEND US AN ALERT AS THEY GET 20% FULL, OR 40% FULL, 60% FULL, WHATEVER ALERTS WE WANT TO GET SO THAT WE THEN KNOW TO GO OUT AND SERVICE. SO ULTIMATELY WE CAN SAVE MORE VOLUME AND TIME THAT WAY. WE ACTUALLY HAVE AS CRAIG MENTIONED, SOME ALREADY DOWNTOWN. AND WE ARE ABLE TO MONITOR THE PERFORMANCE REPOSITION THEM IN LOCATIONS WHERE WE SEE HIGHER VOLUMES SO THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE OVERFLOWING TRASH CANS.
01:01:44.178: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I APPRECIATE IT. SO THIS IN ESSENCE COULD PERHAPS SAVE US MONEY AND HAS IT SHOWN TO SAY -- I MEAN BESIDES ANECDOTALLY DO WE HAVE ANY DATA TO SUGGEST?
01:01:56.990: >> WE DON'T HAVE ANY DATA RIGHT NOW, OTHER THAN WE KNOW AREAS WHERE WE USED TO SERVICE DATEY, WE ARE DOWN TO ONCE A WEEK. AND WE HAVEN'T CALCULATED THAT, BUT WE PLAN TO MONITOR THAT IN THE FIRST YEAR, IF THESE GET APPROVED AND WE PUT THEM IN AND THEN WE CAN ACTUALLY CALCULATE THE SAVINGS TO GER DETERMINE IFE WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE ON AND ADD MORE.
01:02:21.148: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE AND ANSWERING THAT QUESTION.
01:02:26.153: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER GRAND?
01:02:29.189: >> Councilmember Grand: THIS IS ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT I HEAR FROM RESIDENTS, IT'S UP THERE, ABOUT THE OVERFLOWING TRASH IN OUR DOWNTOWN.
01:02:35.963: >> YEAH.
01:02:36.230: >> Councilmember Grand: I'M REALLY GLAD IT'S A BEING ADDRESD IN AN ENVIRONMENTALLY, SUSTAINABLE WAY.
01:02:43.136: >> THANK YOU.
01:02:44.104: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU. CA-19, RESOLUTION TO APPROVE AN AGREEMENT WITH THE DOWNTOWN DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY FOR THE FIRST AND ASHLEY STREET IMPROVEMENT PROJECT. MOVED BY RAMLAWI AND SECONDED BY GRAND. DISCUSSION OF CA-19, COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
01:03:05.158: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I JUST BRING THIS UP TO TALK ABOUT IT, FOR -- FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF JUST CONCERNS IN TERMS OF HOW LONG THESE CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS TAKE AND THE IMPACT ON RESIDENTS, BUSINESSES, OPERATIONS, BUS LINES, EVERYTHING. JUST WANTED TO GET MAYBE A LITTLE BIT OF ON UPDATE AS TO A LITTLE BIT TO ALLEVIATE THOSE CONCERNS, IF THEY HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED IN TERMS OF TIMETABLE. I KNOW IN THE PAST, THERE WAS TALK OF DOING ALL STREETS AT ONCE. HAS THERE BEEN ANYTHING THAT HAS BEEN SCALED BACK OR LO LOOKED AR ANYTHING DIFFERENT? HOW MANY STREETS AT ONCE. IT'S A HEAVILY USED AREA OF OUR DOWNTOWN AND MAJOR PART OF THE DISRUPTION AND IS THE PLAN TO DO BOTH ROADS AT THE SAME.
01:04:09.089: >> THIS IS SUSAN POLLY FROM THE ANN ARBOR D.D.A. I DON'T HAVE WITH ME YET THE SPECIFIC CONSTRUCTION SCHEDULE. WE ARE JUST NOW MEETING WITH THE CONTRACTOR. HE'S JUST BEEN HIRED. THE UNDERSTANDING THAT I HAVE PRELIMINARILY IS WE WILL FOCUS ALMOST ALL OF OUR EFFORTS FIRST TWO YEARS ON FIRST STREET. THAT'S WHERE MOST OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE WILL BE GOING IN AND THAT'S WHERE MOST OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS NEEDED. WE WILL NOT BE TACKLING, AS I UNDERSTAND IT, BOTH STREETS AT THE SAME TIME AND HAVING BOTH STREETS SHUT DOWN. WE HAVE LEARNED A LOT FROM THE LAST TWO PROJECTS AND PARTICULARLY FIFTH AND DETROIT PROJECT ON HOW TO CONDUCT THE CONSTRUCTION IN A WAY THAT MINIMIZES IMPACT. WE'LL BE IN THE ROAD, THOUGH, AND I DON'T WANT TO MISS THE CHANCE TO SAY WHEN WE GET WATER MAIN CONSOLIDATIONS, WHEN YOU ARE DOING THE INFRASTRUCTURE, UNFORTUNATELY, IT DOES TAKE TIME WHEN YOU ARE IN THE STREET TO GET THAT WORK DONE. TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN, KEEPING EVERYONE INFORMED, FINDING OUT FROM THE STAKEHOLDERS THIS IRRELEVANT NEEDS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WRAP THE CONSTRUCTION AROUND WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THEM, WE WILL CERTAINLY DO EVERYTHING WE CAN. I DON'T HAVE THE EXACT SCHEDULE AT THIS TIME.
01:05:16.523: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  HOW ARE YOU DEALING WITH ABANDONED VAULTS ON THE STREET AS WELL, AND ON UPDATED RECORDS AND MISSING INFORMATION AND WE DON'T KNOLL WHAT'S IN THE GROUND UNTIL WE PUT A HOLE IN IT THIS.
01:05:29.736: >> YEAH, WE HAVE MUCH MORE INFORMATION THAN EVER WAS IN HAND BEFORE. ABOUT A YEAR OR SO AGO, THE CITY DID A GROUND PENETRATING RADAR PROJECT, AND WE WERE ABLE TO MAP THE LOCATION OF MANY OF THE VAULTS IN DOWNTOWN. I CAN TELL YOU THAT JUST HAVING DONE HURON STREET THIS LAST YEAR, WE FOUND THREE ON HURON THAT HAVE NOT BEEN FOUND THAT WERE ON THE SOUTH SIDE JUST LAST WEEK, WE WERE ON THE NORTH SIDE. WE FOUND SOME AGAIN ON THE NORTH SIDE THAT HAD NOT BEEN RECORDED BEFORE. SO UNFORTUNATELY WHEN YOU ARE IN AN HISTORIC DOWNTOWN, THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF SURPRISES THAT YOU FIND. WE WORK WITH THE PROPERTY OWNER TO WORK WITH THEM, WITH POSSIBLE TO CLOSE UP THE VAULT. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO GAIN BACK THE RIGHT-OF-WAY FOR THE PUBLIC, AND WITH THEIR PERMISSION, WE FILL THEM IN, WE GET NEW WALKING SURFACE, AND THE CASE ON HOU HURON STREET, THAT'S WHAT WAS GOING ON ON THE SOUTH SIDE AND THE NORTH SIDE. WITH ASHLEY, WE WILL KNOW THERE ARE SOME VAULTS. WE KNOW THOSE LOCATIONS. IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE WILL FIND OTHERS THAT ARE COMING AS A SURPRISE. WE HAVE A VERY GOOD RECORDING OF WHERE THEY ARE LOCATED.
01:06:38.305: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  SO AS I UNDERSTAND, IT DO YOU BELIEVE THIS WILL BE DONE IN ONE CONSTRUCTION YEAR?
01:06:42.943: >> NO. THIS IS DEFINITELY A TWO-YEAR PROJECT. THERE'S AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF INFRASTRUCTURE THAT NEEDS TO BE TACKLED, PARTICULARLY ON FIRST STREET. ALL NEW ELECTRICAL. WE HAVE GOT ALL SORTS OF WORK WITH THE WATER MAINS, NEW WATER MAINS GOING IN. AND WE HAVE -- WE KNOW A LOT OF SIDEWALK WORK AS WELL. NO, THERE'S NO WAY IT WILL BE DONE IN ONE. VERY LIKELY FIRST STREET IS TWO FULL CONSTRUCTION YEARS.
01:07:04.865: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU.
01:07:07.067: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF CA-19. ALL IN FAVOR. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. RESOLUTION NUMBER 20, PROPOSED FULLER COURT AND NIXON/TRAVER SIDEWALK GAP PROJECT, SPECIAL ASSESSMENT DISTRICTS 57 AND 56, MOVED BY RAMLAWI AND SECONDED BY GRAND. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:07:34.261: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I BRING THIS UP WHEN IT COMES TO OUR POLICY AND FILLING IN SIDEWALK GAPS AND THE SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS AND THE ISSUES THAT ARISE WHEN APPROVING THEM. AGAIN, I FEEL LIKE WE NEED TO APPROACH THIS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT IN THE YEARS TO COME. I DON'T HAVE A PARTICULAR PROBLEM WITH THIS, BUT I DO THINK WE NEED TO -- AT LEAST IT'S MY OPINION, I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S CONSENSUS ON COUNCIL, TO SMOOTH OUT THE PEAKS AND VALLEYS OF THESE ASSESSMENTS. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SIDEWALK GAPS THEY ARE FOR THE GREATER GOOD, BUT YET HOMEOWNERS WITH LARGE FURNITURE ARE PENALIZED AT AN EXORBITANT -- I SHOULDN'T SAY PENALIZED BUT CHARGED AND EXORBITANT AMOUNT OF MONEY. IT CAUSES FRICTION. THE STAFF TAKES A LOT OF TIME TO TALK ABOUT THINGS AND ULTIMATELY DON'T GET THE FINAL APPROVAL BECAUSE OF THE FINANCIAL IMPACT ON THE HOMEOWNER OR THE PROPERTY OWNER. I WILL CONTINUE TO SPEAK WITH MAMYCOLLEAGUES AND OTHERS AS TOS TO -- TO -- TO FIND A WAY TO HAVE A COPAY, WHEN IT COMES TO THESE ASSESSMENTS, SO THAT THE FIRST SEVERAL THOUSAND DOLLARS ARE ASSESSED BY THE PROPERTY OWNER, AND THE NEXT SEVERAL THOUSAND DOLLARS ARE ASSESSED BY A JOINT CITY AND PROPERTY OWNER AND THEN ANYTHING ABOVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT IS THEN SHOULDERED BY THE CITY. I JUST FEEL THAT THERE'S JUST TOO MUCH CONFLICT IN THE CURRENT STATE OF AFFAIRS, WHEN WE HAVE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS GOING IN, WE USE THAT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO IT AND I FEEL THAT IS AN INTELLIGENT WAY TO SPEND MONEY, BUT YET WE DON'T END UP GETTING PROJECTS APPROVED, BECAUSE OF THE INEQUITY IN THE ASSESSMENTS. SO I JUST, AGAIN, I WILL BRING THIS UP AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY I CAN GET UNTIL SOMETHING DIFFERENT IS -- IS DONE. THANK YOU.
01:09:43.089: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF CA-20 COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER AND THEN LUMM.
01:09:50.830: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WILL SUPPORT THESE SIDEWALK GAPS. I WISH WE HAD A WAY TO ENCOURAGE THE -- PERHAPS A BETTER WAY TO ENCOURAGE THE FOLKS WHO ARE MOST DIRECTLY BENEFITING FROM THESE KINDS OF THINGS FROM -- TO SORT OF SPREAD OUT THE MAINTENANCE THAT THEY DO. I KNOW WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS INTERNALLY WHERE THINGS ARE BENEFITING THE SCHOOLS OR A HOSPITAL, OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, AND, YOU KNOW, THEY ONLY HAVE THE -- THEY ARE ONLY CHARGED WITH -- YOU ARE ONLY CHARGED WITH THE MAINTENANCE IN ARE FRONT OF WHY YOU ARE SIDEWALK OR ADJACENT TO INJURE R PROPERTY. WE WOULD LIKE THESE LARGER INSTITUTIONS AND THE SCHOOLS AND THE UNIVERSITIES TO MAYBE DO JUST A LITTLE TINY BIT MORE, A LITTLE BIT MORE. I THINK IF THE SCHOOL WOULD HAVE STEPPED UP AND SAID, WE WILL RUN OUR GUY ALL THE WAY AROUND THE BLOCK ON TRAVER, INSTEAD OF BEING SILENT ON THAT MATTER, WE WOULDN'T HAVE HAD THE CONTROVERSY OVER THE TRAVER SIDEWALKS THAT WE DID WHEN THOSE ARE REALLY THE PRIMARY FUNCTION OF THAT WAS TO SERVE AS A DROPOFF ZONE FOR THE NORTH SIDE SCHOOL. I'M THROWING IT OUT THERE, THAT THE COMMUNITY BENEFITS AS A WHOLE, YES, FROM THESE COMMON GOODS BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I THINK THAT SOME FOLKS ARE IN A BETTER POSITION TO HELP THE NEIGHBORHOOD IN MAINTAINING THEM.
01:11:08.441: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
01:11:09.976: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I GENERALLY HAVE MIXED FEELINGS ON THESE WHEN THE FOLKS OBJECTING DON'T SEEM TO WANT THE SIDEWALKS. AND THE FEEDBACK FROM THE PUBLIC MEETINGS WAS THAT THE FOLKS DON'T SEEM TO WANT THE SIDEWALK OR THEY THINK THEY ARE NEEDED. AND THERE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT THE ASSESSMENT AMOUNTS WHICH ARE SIGNIFICANT AT UP TO $8,000 EVEN WITH THE SERVICE TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM GRANT FUNDING. BUT AS WE KNOW, FILLING GAPS IS IDENTIFIED AS A PRIORITY, AND THIS DOES FOLLOW THE STANDARD PROCESS, AND INCLUDES A GRANT. AND THIS IS NOT THE FINAL APPROVAL. WE ARE JUST, OF COURSE, ESTABLISHING THE DOLLAR AMOUNTS. WE ARE NOT APPROVING THE PROJECT AND PRIOR TO THE COUNCIL VOTE, THERE WILL BE A PUBLIC HEARING. AND I WILL JUST NOTE THAT WE EXPECT -- THE COVER MEMO NOTES THAT THE CITY IS IN DISCUSSIONS WITH THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND THE U OF M, REGARDING BEARING THE COST OF THE SIDEWALKS AND THAT ARE ADJACENT TO THEIR PROPERTY, AND -- AND I WOULD EXPECT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AND THE ANN ARBOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS TO AGREE -- TO PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE. I DID ASK A QUESTION ABOUT THIS, AND THE ANN ARBOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS SHARE WOULD BE $4,700, AND THE U OF M SHARE WOULD BE $67,000 -- $67,400. AND CLEARLY, THEY NEED TO STEP UP AND DO WHAT EVERY OTHER PROPERTY OWNER IS EXPECTED TO DO. AND I KNOW THAT THIS -- THE FULLER COURT AREA, PARTICULARLY BENEFITS A LOT OF UNIVERSITY STUDENTS. I HAVE BEEN IN -- I HAVE BEEN INVITED BY FOLKS AT HURON TOWERS TO COME AND VIEW WHERE THESE STUDENTS WALK AND -- YEAH. I MEAN, THE STUDENTS CROSSING FULLER FROM NORTH CAMPUS, TO WHEREVER THEY LIVE, THEY WALK HERE, AND THE FOLKS GOING TO THE V.A. HOSPITAL, ON AND ON AND ON. THIS' A LOT OF U OF M USAGE. AND, AGAIN, THEY JUST -- THEY NEED TO DO WHAT EVERY OTHER PROPERTY OWNER IS EXPECTED TO DO IN TERMS OF PAYING FOR THESE NEW SIDEWALKS, AND SO I LOOK FORWARD TO THIS COMING BACK WITH THEM BEING FULLY ON BOARD, THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND THE UNIVERITY IN PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE. THANKS.
01:13:39.125: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSIONS? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. WE NOW COME TO PUBLIC HEARINGS.

01:15:30.503: >> Councilmember Lumm: JUST THANKS. THANK YOU. THESE ARE ALL BEING ZONED PUBLIC LAND. THESE ARE PROPERTIES THAT ARE CITY PARK LAND, WERE DONATED OR PURCHASED, AS PART OF PRIVATE DEVELOPMENTS OVER THE YEARS. SO I -- I APPRECIATE THE CLEANUP.
01:15:49.389: >> Mayor Taylor: PLEASE, CLERK.
01:15:51.624: >> Clerk Beaudry: IF THESE ARE NOT CRITICAL IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS, IF WE COULD PUSH OUT THE SECOND READING, BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE STAFF IN THE OFFICE TO DO THE PUBLIC HEARING NOTICES.
01:16:05.638: >> Mayor Taylor: SURE. SO WITH -- TO WHAT DATE DO YOU RECOMMEND? THE FIRST MEETING IN MAY? IS THAT TOO FAR?
01:16:20.153: >> Clerk Beaudry: THAT WOULD BE GREAT.
01:16:27.593: >> Mayor Taylor: SO WITH COUNCIL'S ACQUIESCENCE, WE WILL MOVE THE PUBLIC HEARINGS ON C-2 THROUGH C-7 TO THE FIRST MEETING IN MAY. ARE WE ALL GOOD.

01:18:31.484: >> Councilmember Hayner:  THEY KNOW THEY HAVE OUR SUPPORT AND NOW THEY REALLY KNOW THAT THEY HAVE OUR SUPPORT. SO I URGE EVERYONE SO SAY YES.
01:18:38.324: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
01:18:40.760: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES, SO THIS IS, OF COURSE, BEING SPONSORED BY THE POLICY AGENDA COMMITTEE. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER AND I SERVE ON THAT COMMITTEE, AND THE HOUSE BILLS THAT COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER WAS REFERENCING, I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THEY HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED BY OUR LOCAL REPRESENTATIVES, ROBBIE WARREN LUZINSKI AND THIS HOUSE BILL HAS BEEN ASSIGNED TO THE COMMITTEE ON NATURAL RESOURCES AND THEN SENATE BILL 116 HAS BEEN INTRODUCED BY SENATOR JEFF IRWIN, THAT'S ASSIGNED TO A COMMITTEE ON ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY. NEITHER BILL HAS BEEN SCHEDULED FOR A HEARING AT THIS POINT, AND -- BUT -- BUT IT'S OBVIOUSLY, YOU KNOW, SOMETHING -- I THINK WE HAVE ALL BEEN ADVOCATING FOR, AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE THIS IS ALL GOING TO -- HOW THIS IS ALL GOING TO PLAY OUT, BECAUSE I BELIEVE THE STATE LEGISLATURE IS ALSO ABOUT TO GO INTO A 30-DAY RECESS. SO, -- BUT IT'S IN THE PIPELINE, AND, AGAIN, NEITHER BILL HAS BEEN SCHEDULED FOR PAY HEARING, BUT WE'RE AHEAD OF IT, THE CURVE, I GUESS. THANK YOU.
01:19:53.499: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED.
01:20:09.348: >> Councilmember Hayner:  CAN THIS BE SPLIT INTO A --
01:20:13.586: >> Councilmember Grand: IT'S BEEN TAKEN OFF.
01:20:16.889: >> Councilmember Hayner: SHOULD IT GO INTO A TWO-APPOINTMENT SITUATION?
01:20:21.027: >> Mayor Taylor: LET ME HAVE A MOTION TO ALTA ALTER THE AGENDA- HOW ABOUT ACCLAMATION, WE PUT DC-2 AFTER DC-5 -- OH, THEY ARE COMING BACK.
01:20:33.739: >> SO MOVED.
01:20:34.473: >> Councilmember Hayner: SECOND.
01:20:36.375: >> Mayor Taylor: YEAH. OKAY. SO BY ACCLAMATION, DC-2 IS MOVED AFTER DC-5. DC-3. RESOLUTION DIRECTING THE PLANNING COMMISSION TO CREATE A TRANSIT SUPPORTED DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT. MOVED BY ACKERMAN, SECONDED BY GRAND. DISCUSSION OF DC-3? COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN. ING.
01:20:57.430: >> Councilmember Ackerman: PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS RECOMMEND THAT YOU CONTINUE WITH YOUR DAILY ROUTINES. SO MY DAILY ROUTINE IS TO GET YOUR BLOOD BOILING TO SOME EXTENT. SO I CONTINUE WITH THAT, BUT GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE TO POSTPONE THIS UNTIL APRIL 6th.
01:21:12.411: >> Mayor Taylor: SECONDED BY GRAND. DISCUSSION OF POSTPONEMENT? DISCUSSION COUNCILMEMBER GRAND?
01:21:17.583: >> Councilmember Grand: I JUST WANTED TO EXTEND MY APPRECIATION FOR ALL THE WORK THAT COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN HAS DONE ON THIS AS WELL, IT'S JUST THAT WE HEARD FROM -- WELL, WE DON'T HAVE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC HERE WHICH I  KNOW IS A CONCERN. WE HAVE HEARD FROM DOZENS, IF NOT -- I DON'T KNOW -- I WOULD SAY I HAVE GOTTEN CLOSE TO 100 EMAILS AND ABOUT 97% OF THEM ARE -- WERE IN SUPPORT OF DC-3. SO TO ALL OF THOSE WHO REACHED OUT, JUST WANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT THAT WAS HEARD, THAT I'M PROUD TO BE A COSPONSOR OF THIS, AND LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING IT AT OUR FIRST MEETING IN APRIL.
01:21:51.917: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
01:21:53.886: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANKS, MR. MAYOR. I WILL HAVE A LOT MORE TO SAY ON THIS, WHEN IT COMES BACK ON APRIL 6th, BUT I CERTAINLY SUPPORT THE POSTPONEMENT AND I'M BLAHED TO SEE THAT THAT'S WHAT WE ARE -- I'M GLAD TO SEE THAT THAT'S WHAT WE ARE DOING TONIGHT, LEAST THAT'S WHAT IT APPEARS TO BE. CREATING THE TRANSIT SUPPORTED ZONING DISTRICT IS AN IMPORTANT POLICY DECISION AND ONE THAT IN THE COMMUNITY HAVE STRONG VIEWS ON. BECAUSE OF THAT, WITH THIS ITEM ON THE AGENDA, THE LIKELY RESULT WOULD HAVE BEEN A ROOM FULL OF FOLKS, I BELIEVE, AND THAT'S THE LAST THING THAT WE ALL RECOGNIZE WE SHOULD BE ENCOURAGING AT THIS POINT. SO I APPRECIATE THE COMMON SENSE IS PREVAILING AND THE SPONSORS HAVE AGREED TO THE POSTPONEMENT. TO BE HONEST FOR THE REASONS I WON'T GET INTO TONIGHT, THE REASONS LARGELY RELATED TO CREATING A ROBUST COMMUNITY DISCUSSION ON THIS, SIGNIFICANT CHANGE TO ZONING, AND ITS IMPLICATIONS AND RELATED TO THE TIMING, THESE -- OF THIS VIS-A-VIS THE MASTER PLAN, UPDATE AND OTHER PLANNING COMMISSION WORK, I BELIEVE A LONGER POSTPONEMENT OR TABLING IS MORE APPROPRIATE BUT I WILL SUPPORT THE SHORT-TERM POSTPONEMENT AND PROVIDE MY FULL COMMENTS AT THE NEXT MEETING. SO THANKS.
01:23:04.957: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] IF I MAY, I WILL JUST PULL BACK. I GUESS I WOULD LIKE FOR MY PART PRIOR TO THE VOTE THANK COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. I BELIEVE IT'S PROPER AND APPROPRIATE TO HAVE THIS POSTPONED, BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT I FULLY SUPPORT THIS CONCEPT. I THINK FOLKS IN THE COMMUNITY HAVE MADE VERY CLEAR THAT THEY NEED MORE HOUSING AND THEY NEED MORE HOUSING THAT IS PROXIMATE TO TRANSPORTATION CORRIDORS THAT WILL AFFECT MULTIPLE GOALS, OF COURSE A GOAL WITH RESPECT TO CLIMATE CHANGE BUT ALSO A GOAL WITH RESPECT TO AFFORDABILITY FOR THESE -- OUR, IF NOT BY LAW, LIKELY TO BE AFFORDABLE. THEY WOULD CERTAINLY, I BELIEVE, BY NATURE OF THE MARKET BE MORE AFFORDABLE THAN APARTMENTS IN OTHER LOCATIONS. THAT IS TO SAY, RESIDENCES ON TRANSIT CORRIDORS. I WILL LET IT CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION. FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR OF THE POSTPONEMENT. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT IS POSTPONED TO OUR NEXT MEETING. DC-4. RESOLUTION TO APPROVE STREET CLOSINGS FOR A CELEBRATION COMMEMORATING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF EARTH DAY ON APRIL 22, 2020. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN AND SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRAND. DISCUSSION OF DC-4? BAR. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
01:24:30.709: >> Councilmember Lumm: MY ONLY CONCERN HERE OBVIOUSLY -- WELL, I WOULD HAVE NO ISSUE WITH THIS IN NORMAL TIMES, BUT WE'RE NOT IN NORMAL TIMES, OBVIOUSLY, AND APRIL 22nd ISN'T THAT FAR OFF, JUST A MONTH AWAY. AND I DON'T THINK THE CITY SHOULD BE SPONSORING OR PLANNING ANY GROUP GATHERINGS AT THIS POINT. YOU KNOW, I RECOGNIZE THAT THE 50th ANNIVERSARY OF EARTH DAY IS A SIGNIFICANT OCCASION. BUT I AM CONCERNED THAT WE COULD BE, YOU KNOW, SPENDING TIME AND MONEY PLANNING AN EVENT, WHERE THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE WE MAY NEED TO CANCEL IT. I'M PUTTING THAT OUT THERE. AS YOU KNOW, WE HAVE BEEN CANCELING LEFT AND RIGHT ALL OF THESE STREET CLOSURES AND. EVENTSTHAT WE PREVIOUSLY APPROV. I THINK WE NEED TO BE CAUTIOUS IN GOING FORWARD IN TERMS OF THE EFFORT THAT GOES INTO THIS.
01:25:25.931: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. CRAWFORD?
01:25:26.565: >> City Admin. Crawford: THANK YOU, MAYOR. YES, STAFF HAS BEEN WORKING ON THIS, AND AS WE LOOK FORWARD, YOU KNOW, WE ARE ANTICIPATING THAT IF THE -- IT APPEARS THAT WE -- IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK THAT WE NEED TO CANCEL MORE EVENTS, NOT JUST THIS EVENT BUT ANY OTHER EVENT THAT WE WOULD CANCEL THIS EVENT. ONE OF THE BENEFITS, WE THOUGHT, OF CONTINUING WITH THE PLANNING AT THIS STAGE, IS THAT WHEN -- WHEN THINGS DO OPEN BACK UP, HAVING A CELEBRATION DOWNTOWN WOULD BE BENEFICIAL AND THIS MAY BE ONE OF THE FIRST ONES. WE JUST DON'T KNOW ON THE TIMING YET. SO IF COUNCIL APPROVES THIS, STAFF IS LOOKING AT THIS FROM A PERSPECTIVE THAT WE'RE GOING TO KEEP PLANNING UNTIL IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE, IF YOU APPROVE IT.
01:26:12.845: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
01:26:14.480: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
01:26:16.815: >> Councilmember Hayner: FURTHER DISCUSSION?
01:26:20.119: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
01:26:21.020: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I WOULD LIKE TO ECHO THE SENTIMENTS OF COUNCILMEMBER LUMM. I NOTICED SPEAKING WITH STAFF ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES THAT OUR CITY HAS EXPENDED ON STREET CLOSURES AND SPECIAL EVENTS LAST YEAR, CAUSED SIGNIFICANT DELAYS IN PROVIDING OTHER TYPES OF SERVICES FOR THE CITY AT A GREAT EXPENSE. I JUST -- I WILL CONTINUE TO CAUTION THESE STREET CLOSURES, WHILE WE HAVE THE CITY OF THE CENTER CITY VACANT. AND LIBERTY PLAZA, UNPROGRAMMED. SO AS WE CONTINUE TO GO FORWARD AND HOPE WE HAVE AN ASSEMBLANCE OF A NORMAL FUNCTIONING SOCIETY, THAT WE PLAN THESE THINGS IN AREAS OF DOWNTOWN THAT DON'T HAVE THE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT THAT THESE STREET CLOSURES HAVE ON SMALL BUSINESSES. I MEAN, AS A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER, I CAN TELL YOU, 9 OUT OF 10 OF THESE EVENTS HURT OUR BUSINESS. PEOPLE CAN'T COME AND GET THEIR GOODS OR SERVICES. IT SNARLS TRAFFIC. IT LEADS PEOPLE TO DRIVE ERRATICALLY, DANGEROUSLY. IT'S JUST NOT A GOOD MIX. I APPRECIATE OUR CITY ADMINISTRATOR'S OPTIMISM AND I HOPE THAT COMES TRUE. ONE THING I DID FIND THROUGH MY EXPERIENCES OF BEING IN DOWNTOWN, IS THAT IN THE SUMMERTIME, WHEN THE STUDENTS ARE GONE, LAST WEEKEND OF EX-MONTH, PERHAPS, WE CAN HAVE A DOWNTOWN CELEBRATION THAT IS SCHEDULED, YOU KNOW, WITH PREDICTABILITY AND FREQUENCY, RATHER THAN JUST THESE IRREGULAR POP-UPS THAT OCCUR RANDOMLY AND IF YOU ARE NOT IN THAT CERTAIN SOCIAL GROUP, YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S GOING ON. SO WE DO HAVE ASSETS. WE HAVE REAL ESTATE TO HOLD THESE THINGS. WE NEED TO SHIFT OUR FOCUS. THIS IS GOING TO BE A DIFFICULT TIME DOWNTOWN FOR MANY BUSINESS OWNERS. WHEN WE DO GET BACK TO NORMAL, THEY ARE GOING TO BE VERY SENSITIVE TO THINGS AND WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO MORE STREET CLOSURES WHEN THEY DO REOPEN, IT'S NOT REALLY GOING TO HELP THEM. THANK YOU.
01:28:49.935: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. DC-5 RESOLUTION TO APPOINT MATTHEW HORNING AS THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR INTERIM CONTROLLER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, AND SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRAND. DISCUSSION OF DC-5. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
01:29:10.989: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. AISLE PLEASED TO BE A COSPONSOR WITH YOU ON THIS RESOLUTION TO APPOINT MATTHEW HORNING AS THE INTERIM CITY CONTROLLER AND CFO. MATT HAS SERVED EFFECTIVELY IN THIS INTERIM ROLE PREVIOUSLY, FILLING IN FOR TOM CRAW CRAWFORD TOM RECOMMENDS THAT WE APPOINT HIM AGAIN. IT WOULD BE UNTIL MR. CRAWFORD RETURNS TO THE C.F.O. POSITION OR COUNCIL MAKES OTHER APPOINTMENTS. I HAVE WORKED CLOSELY WITH MATT ON THE INSURANCE BOARD, AND ON OTHER MATTERS WHEN HE WAS CITY TREASURER AND I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN IMPRESSED WITH HIS WORK, HIS KNOWLEDGE AND HIS SKILLS. AS MR. CRAWFORD, I HAVE FULL CONFIDENCE THAT MATT WILL PERFORM THIS ROLE EFFECTIVELY AND THAT HE'S THE RIGHT PERSON FOR THE POSITION. I ENCOURAGE ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES TO SUPPORT THIS INTERIM APPOINTMENT AND THANK YOU.
01:29:57.836: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER GRAND?
01:29:59.938: >> Councilmember Bannister:  I
01:30:01.707: >> Councilmember Grand: I WANT TO EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION THAT HE'S COMING OUT OF RETIREMENT TO HELP SERVE OUR CITY IN THIS CAPACITY. THAT MEANS A GREAT DEAL.
01:30:09.781: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. I GUESS I LOOKED TO MR. POSTEMA ON SOME ASSISTANCE ON DC-2, WHICH WE MOVED OVER TO THIS LOCATION. IT'S ONE-STEP APPOINTMENT, IDEALLY WITH EIGHT VOTE REQUIREMENT. ARE WE ABLE TO WAIVE THAT RULE WITH 6 COUNCILMEMBERS TO APPOINT MR. CRAWFORD TO THE D.D.A.?
01:30:40.445: >> City Atty. Postema: BECAUSE HE LIVES OUT OF TOWN OR -- WHAT IS THE ISSUE?
01:30:44.516: >> Mayor Taylor: IT IS A ONE-STEP APPOINTMENT. THEREBY REQUIRING A SUPER MAJORITY. I ASSUME THAT WE CAN'T -- WITH THE MINORITY -- WITH THE BARE MAJORITY WAIVE A SUPERMAJORITY REQUIREMENT IN OUR COUNCIL RULES.
01:31:00.232: >> City Atty. Postema: THAT IS CORRECT.
01:31:02.100: >> Mayor Taylor: ALL RIGHT. SO WITH COUNCIL'S ACQUIESCENCE, LET'S PUT OFF DC-2 TO BRIGHTER DAYS. LET'S HAVE IT BE A TWO-STEP VOTE IN CASE AT OUR NEXT MEETING WE DON'T HAVE A SUPERMAJORITY. HOW IS THAT?
01:31:18.383: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WOULD MOVE TO CHANGE THIS TO A TWO-STEP VOTE.
01:31:22.187: >> Mayor Taylor: ARE E SOLUTION TO APPOINT -- DC-2, RESOLUTION TO APPOINT TOM CRAWFORD TO THE DOWNTOWN DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY, MOVED BY HAYNER AND SECONDED BY LUMM. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
01:31:32.364: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I KNOW THAT YOU WILL CONTINUE TO SERVE IN THIS ROLE, DESPITE YOUR -- THE LACK OF A FORMAL APPOINTMENT AND I APPRECIATE THAT. AND LET'S JUST MOVE THIS FORWARD HERE, AND IS IT BY COUNCIL RULE OR THE CHARTER THAT ADMINISTRATORS SERVE ON THE D.D.A. -- IT'S A COUNCIL CHARTER?
01:31:49.915: >> Mayor Taylor: IT IS STATE LAW. IT'S EITHER HIM OR ME.
01:31:53.552: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YOU WANT IT, HMM, MR. CRAWFORD? ALL RIGHT, I WILL SUPPORT THIS. FURTHER DISCUSSION, COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
01:32:02.094: >> Councilmember Lumm: I ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT THIS. IT'S PER THE CITY CHARTER. IT'S EITHER THE MAYOR OR THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR SERVES ON THE D.D.A. AND IT CERTAINLY MAKES SENSE FOR THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR TO SERVE ON THE D.D.A. THAT'S BEEN THE PRACTICE. IT'S SIMPLY, YOU KNOW, A CALL BETWEEN THE MAYOR AND THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR, AND THIS SIMPLY FOLLOWS RECENT PRACTICE. ACTUALLY FOR A NUMBER OF RECENT CITY ADMINISTRATORS, I BELIEVE. WELL, NO. MAYOR, HEFFIA DID SERVE ON THE D.D.A. BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING, I THINK THIS IS MORE TYPICAL. SO THANK YOU FOR STEPPING UP. THANKS FOR SUGGESTING THE TWO-STEP PROCESS SO WE CAN GET THIS BALL ROLLING.
01:32:43.702: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. WE HAVE DC-7 WHICH DOESN'T APPEAR ON THE PAPER AGENDA BUT IT DOES APPEAR ON THE ELECTRONIC AGENDA. MR. POSTEMA?
01:32:57.416: >> City Atty. Postema: AND I SENT OFF -- AND I'M SORRY, I JUST MISSED IT, THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR CRAWFORD DID A DRAFT OF THIS RESOLUTION. I DID ANOTHER DRAFT, AND MY RESOLUTION -- EXCUSE ME, THE RESOLVE CLAUSE, I THINK THAT HE'S GOING TO ADD, AND THE REASON WAS NOT IN HIS RESOLUTION, BUT IT IS IN MINE, AND THAT IS UNDER THE CITY'S EMERGENCY ORDINANCE, THE MAYOR CAN MAKE A DECLARATION OF A LOCAL STATE OF EMERGENCY. CLEARLY UNDER CHAPTER 15 HE HAS THAT POWER. HOWEVER, IT EXPIRES WITHIN SEVEN DAYS, UNLESS THE COUNCIL BY MAJORITY VOTE AT AN OPEN PUBLIC MEETING, MOVES TO EXTEND THAT BEYOND THE SEVEN DAYS. AND I CERTAINLY RECOMMEND THAT THAT BE EXTENDED FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS AS WE MOVE FORWARD, THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF BERN FITS OF HAVING THIS IN PLACE -- BENEFITS OF HAVING THIS IN PLACE, BOTH AS TO STATE FUNDING AND POWERS THAT WE MAY NEED. SO I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS, BUT THAT'S WHY IT'S ON TONIGHT, AND THAT'S WHY IT'S BEEN DONE QUICKLY, AND WHY I'M THANKFUL THAT AT THIS MEETING, THERE'S A QUORUM OF SIX THAT CAN VOLT ON THIS.
01:34:10.989: >> Mayor Taylor: SO THAT'S DC-7, RESOLUTION TO CONTINUE MAYOR'S DECLARATION OF LOCAL, STATE EMERGENCY, MOVED BY ACKERMAN AND SECONDED BY HAYNER. DISCUSSION FURTHER OF DC-7? COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN?
01:34:24.402: >> Councilmember Ackerman: JUST BY WAY OF PROCESS, THE LANGUAGE OF DC-7 IN LEGISTAR APPEARS TO BE DIFFERENT THAN MR. POSTEMA'S VIEW. DO YOU WANT A REPLACEMENT OR AN AMENDMENT OF INSERTION?
01:34:37.749: >> I THINK THAT I LIKE MR. CRAWFORD LANGUAGE. IT WAS DONE IN LESS HASTE THAN MINE UPSTAIRS, AND IS THE ONLY CHANGE --
01:34:47.692: >> Mayor Taylor: CAN YOU COME TO THE PODIUM -- HERE WE CAN HEAR YOU, IT'S --
01:34:51.696: >> YES, I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT MY RESOLVE CLAUSE ABOUT CONTINUING IT PAST THE 23rd BE INCLUDED. SO I THINK WITH THAT CHANGE, YOU KNOW, HIS --
01:35:04.009: >> Councilmember Lumm: THAT'S A WHEREAS CLAUSE.
01:35:05.977: >> Mayor Taylor: JUST TO BE CLEAR --
01:35:07.245: >> SWAP OUT ONE RESOLVE CLAUSE.
01:35:10.749: >> Mayor Taylor: LET'S -- LET ME SUGGEST THIS. THERE WAS AN EMAIL DISTRIBUTED TO US AT 8:19 FROM YOU. IS THAT THE PROPER VERSION OF THE RESOLUTION?
01:35:20.625: >> Councilmember Lumm: WE GOT IT 15 MINUTES AGO.
01:35:25.664: >> City Atty. Postema: THAT RESOLVE CLAUSE I HAVE AND ADD IT TO M MR. CRAWFORD'S THAT'S ON DC-7.
01:35:33.872: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  SO YOU WOULD LIKE US TO INSERT YOUR SINGLE RESOLVE CLAUSE FROM YOUR EMAIL INTO MR. CRAWFORD'S -- THE BODY OF HIS RESOLUTION, AS A THIRD RESOLVE CLAUSE?
01:35:45.050: >> City Atty. Postema: YES.
01:35:45.650: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  SO MOVED --
01:35:46.785: >> City Atty. Postema: NO, IT WOULD BE FIRST RESOLVE CLAUSE.
01:35:49.354: >> Councilmember Lumm: I'M SEEING ONE AND ONLY ONE RESOLVE CLAUSE. COULD SOMEONE READ THIS?
01:35:53.325: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  IN LEGGY STAR. HE VOTE A VERSION WITH TWO RESOLVE CLAUSES. LATER TONIGHT, MR. POSTEMA EMAILED US A RESOLUTION WITH ONE RESOLVE CLAUSE.
01:36:02.801: >> Councilmember Lumm: 15 MINUTES AGO.
01:36:04.870: >> Councilmember Ackerman: BUT THE ONE ON LEGISTAR, THAT WAS THE ORIGINAL ONE.
01:36:12.277: >> Councilmember Lumm: WHEN WAS THAT ADDED? AFTER THE MEETING, RIGHT?
01:36:15.647: >> City Admin. Crawford: PRIOR TO THE MEETING.
01:36:17.616: >> Councilmember Lumm: WHEN WE WERE IN EXECUTIVE SESSION. WE WERE IN EXECUTIVE SESSION. SO I DIDN'T SEE IT. I HAVE NOT SEEN THE LEGISTAR VERSION.
01:36:29.427: >> Mayor Taylor: PERHAPS YOU COULD READ THE RESOLUTION IN ITS ENTIRETY AND YOU WOULD LIKE YOUR RESOLVE CLAUSE TO BE FIRST OR LAST.
01:36:36.134: >> City Atty. Postema: I WOULD LIKE IT TO BE FIRST AND REPLACING MANY CRAWFORD'S FIRST RESOLVE CLAUSE.
01:36:42.340: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  I WILL READ THE ENTIRE THING AND CALLING OUT THE AMENDMENT I'M MAKING AT THE SAME TIME.
01:36:46.778: >> Councilmember Lumm: AND THE AMENDMENT WHICH IS THE CITY ATTORNEY'S AMENDMENT.
01:36:50.382: >> Councilmember Ackerman: EXACTLY RIGHT. WHEREAS THE SPREAD OF COVID-19 IS CONSIDERED A GLOBAL PANDEMIC; WHEREAS, THE FEDERAL AND THE STATE GOVERNMENT HAVE DECLARED A STATE OF EMERGENCY IN ORDER TO LESSEN THE IMPACT OF COVID-19; WHEREAS SOME LOCAL USES OF RESOURCES MAY BE REIMBURSABLE FROM FEDERAL OR STATE GOVERNMENT AT A FUTURE DATE, IF A LOCAL STATE OF EMERGENCY IS DECLARED; WHEREAS, THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR DESIRES TO REGULARLILY PURSUE THE REDUCTION OF COVID-19 AND PROTECT THEIR HEALTH AND SAFETY, AND WHEREAS, THE MAYOR OF THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR AS THE CHIEF ELECTED OFFICIAL DECLARED A LOCAL STATE OF EMERGENCY ON MARCH 16th, 2020, NOW I'M GOING TO INSERT -- I WILL MOVE TO INSERT A RESOLVE CLAUSE THAT READS RESOLVED THAT THE MAYOR'S DECLARATION OF LOCAL STATE OF EMERGENCY IS HEREBY EXTENDED AND CONTINUED UNTIL THE CITY COUNCIL VOTES TO DISCONTINUE THIS STATE -- THIS LOCAL STATE OF EMERGENCY DECLARATION.
01:37:50.809: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE A SECOND?
01:37:52.978: >> Councilmember Ackerman: WELL, THERE'S TWO OTHER RESOLVES.
01:37:56.214: >> Mayor Taylor: SECOND TO YOUR AMENDMENT.
01:37:58.516: >> Councilmember Ackerman: SECOND TO THE AMENDMENT. OKAY. THE NEXT RESOLVE CLAUSE READS RESOLVE THAT COUNCIL CONCURS AND SUPPORTS THE MAYOR'S DECLARATION OF A LOCAL STATE OF EMERGENCY, AND FINALLY RESOLVE THAT THE CITY CLERK PROVIDE THE ATTACHED DECLARATION TO MICHIGAN STATE POLICE AND THE DISTRICT TO SOUTH EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AND HOMELAND SECURITY DIVISION COORDINATOR.
01:38:24.075: >> Mayor Taylor: DISCUSSION OF DC-7. DISCUSSION OF THE AMENDMENT. IS THAT FRIENDLY -- IS THE AMENDMENT FRIENDLY TO THE BODY?
01:38:32.751: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES. MM-HMM.
01:38:35.520: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, DISCUSSION. LET ME, IF I MAY, APOLOGIZE FOR A LITTLE BIT OF CONFUSION FOR COUNCIL. AS FOLKS KNOW, WE WERE DISCUSSING OVER THE COURSE OF THE WEEKEND, YOU KNOW, DECLARING AN EMERGENCY IN PART FOR THE PURPOSE OF CLOSING BARS AND RESTAURANTS, BUT FOR DINE OUT AND DELIVERY. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE CITY WAS PREPARED TO DO IN ITS OWN RIGHTS. TAKEOUT. EXCEPT FOR TAKEOUT AND DELIVERY. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WAS THE PREPARED WAS TO DO IN ITS OWN RIGHTS, BUT IN THE INTERVENING TIME, IT WAS NOT AN INTERNAL DISCUSSION, BUT I STATED MY DESIRE AND YOU KNEW THAT THIS WAS IN THE -- IN THE OFFING. THE STATE MOVED ON THE POINT, THUS OBVIATING THE NEED FOR THE ACTION. THE STATE OF EMERGENCY, HOWEVER, CONTINUES TO EXIST, YOU KNOW, I'M PROPOSING, I ACCEPT -- I SUSPECT THAT YOU WILL CONCUR AND THIS RESOLUTION SEEKS TO -- SEEKS TO RATIFY THAT DECLARATION, PERMIT ITS EXTENSION BEYOND SEVEN DAYS FOR THE PURPOSES IDENTIFIED BY MR. POSTEMA, AND THEN WHEN STATE OF EMERGENCY IS PASSED, WE WILL AS A BODY DECLARE IT SO. SO THERE'S NO -- THERE IS NO ADDITIONAL ACTION, ADDITIONAL PUBLIC RESTRICTION, ADDITIONAL USE OF RESOURCES ASSOCIATED WITH THIS DECLARATION, IT'S MERELY RATIFYING THE DECLARATION, PERMITTING THOSE THINGS TO OCCUR DOWNSTREAM SHOULD THEY BE NECESSARY. AND MY APOLOGIES FOR NOT MAKING THAT CHEE CLEAR FROM THE JUMP. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
01:40:10.949: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WANT TO MAKE TWO COMMENTS. FIRST ONE IS -- THREE, ACTUALLY. I DIDN'T SEE IT BECAUSE I GUESS I HAVE A -- I DON'T HAVE MANY DEVICES. I DIDN'T GET TO SEE THIS. I WILL VOTE FOR THIS ON YOUR SUGGESTIONS. AND THAT YOUR DECLARATION -- YOUR INITIAL DECLARATION OF THE LOCAL STATE OF EMERGENCY IS ATTACHED, THANK YOU FOR THAT. AND IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THIS WOULD ALSO HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO COVER EXPENDITURESES IS SUGGESTED 200K TO AVOID FORECLOSURES IN OUR COMMUNITY? SO WOULD THAT POTENTIALLY GIVE US THE WHEREWITHAL TO SHIFT FUNDS ABOUT IN ANTICIPATION OF RECOUPING THOSE FUNDS AT A FUTURE TIME WHEN EIGHT OF US ARE HERE AT THE TABLE, ET CETERA? DOES THAT SEEM LIKE IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE?
01:41:01.299: >> City Admin. Crawford: THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WILL INCLUDE, SHOULD THAT OPPORTUNITY OPEN UP. WE WILL INCLUDE IT IN ANYTHING THAT WE CAN. AND I WOULD THINK THAT WOULD BE ON THE TABLE.
01:41:11.209: >> Councilmember Hayner: OKAY. I THINK THAT'S ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE AND I ENCOURAGE THE USE FOR THAT. SO THANK YOU.
01:41:16.648: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
01:41:19.250: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. YES, THIS CAME TO US FAST AND FURIOUS, JUST LIKE EVERYTHING IS. AND DURING OUR DISCUSSIONS OVER THE WEEKEND, WE TALKED ABOUT TAKING ACTIONS AND IN THOSE OCCASIONS, YOU KNOW, HAVING, YOU KNOW, SOME ANSWERS FOR -- FOR SOME REALLY LOW-HANGING QUESTIONS AND A LOT OF THEM ARE SUNSET PROVISIONS. MOST PEOPLE WILL ASK HOW LONG, YOU KNOW, OKAY, WE CAN DO THIS BUT FOR HOW LONG AND THOSE QUESTIONS WILL IN CONTINUE TO REMAIN. SO WITH THIS, I JUST -- WE'LL BE SUPPORTING -- WITH SOME HESITATION, AND THE FACT THAT AS A BODY, AND POLICY MAKING PART OF ME FEELS LIKE WE ARE SURRENDERING PART OF OUR DECISION MAKING IN THIS DECLARATION, AND WHAT I WANT TO ASK IS, WHAT -- WHAT ARE WE SURRENDERING IN THIS? IF IT CAN BE TOLD TO US A VERY, VERY SHORT BIT HERE. WHAT POWERS IS COUNCIL SURRENDERING?
01:42:29.754: >> City Atty. Postema: WELL, COUNCIL, IN SOME WAYS IS NOT SUR RENDING ANYTHING BUT TAKING THE POWER TO THEMSELVES. THE MAYOR HAS UNDER CHAPTER 15 SEVEN DAYS IN WHICH HE CAN DECLARE A STATE OF EMERGENCY, A LOCAL STATE OF EMERGENCY AND ASK ACT WITHIN THOSE SEVEN DAYS WITH OR WITHOUT COUNCIL'S APPROVAL ON A NUMBER OF THINGS. THE MAIN ONE BEING ACTUALLY, IS A -- THERE'S A PROVISION, THE MAYOR COULD ISSUE DIRECTIVES AS TO TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS ON THE LOCAL ROADS, FOR EXAMPLE. THAT'S SOMETHING, YOU CAN IMAGINE BEFORE A MEETING COULD EVEN BE CALLED, YOU COULD HAVE A TYPE OF EMERGENCY WHERE THAT WOULD BE NECESSARY. SO -- SO THAT'S ONE -- THAT'S ONE THING. BUT THE STATUTE, AGAIN, REALLY REQUIRES THE MAYOR TO -- TO INVOLVE THE COUNCIL TO HAVE MEETINGS, INTERESTINGLY THE -- A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE ASKED ABOUT THIS, BUT UNDER CHAPTER 15, EVEN THE EMERGENCY MEETINGS ARE REQUIRED TO MEET UNDER THE OPEN MEETINGS ACT, AND THAT MEANS -- SO IT BEGS THE QUESTION THAT PEOPLE HAD CONCERNS ABOUT. SHOULD WE CANCEL MEETINGS? SHOULD WE NOT HAVE THE PUBLIC COME? THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ARE WORKING OUT RIGHT NOW. THERE IS NO STATE LAW THAT ALLOWS A PUBLIC MEETING TO NOT ALLOW THE PUBLIC TO COME. AND SO DOES THAT MAKE SENSE IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS? I'M NOT SURE IT DOES, BUT THAT'S THE -- THAT'S THE WISDOM OF THE -- OF THE LEGISLATURE, AND PERHAPS THE GOVERNOR WILL ALTER THAT A RULE, IF, IN FACT, THAT CAN BE DONE. SO THAT IS THE MAIN PURPOSE OF DECLARING A LOCAL EMERGENCY IS THE ABILITY TO RECOUP FUNDS FROM THE TIME THAT SUCH A DECLARATION IS MADE, THAT THAT'S THE MAIN -- IF YOU ARE ASKING WHAT IS THE BENEFIT, IT'S NOT WHAT SURRENDERING, BUT WHAT YOU ARE GAINING.
01:44:37.882: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: AND, OF COURSE, I THINK WE CALLED IT ONCE BEFORE WHEN THE MAYOR WAS OUT OF CO COUNTRY, THE COUNCIL CAN CALL A SPECIAL MEETING WITH THREE COUNCILMEMBERS; IS THAT CORRECT?
01:44:51.496: >> City Atty. Postema: YES.
01:44:52.096: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: WITH THAT IN MIND, I DO COURAGE THE MAYOR TO KEEP US IN -- I DO ENCOURAGE THE MAYOR TO KEEP US IN THE LOOP. I KNOW THINGS ARE CHANGING AND CHANGING FAST AND SOMETIMES WE ARE NOT GETTING THE INFORMATION FROM THE SOURCES WE THOUGHT WE WOULD GET THEM FROM. WE ARE GETTING THEM FROM OTHER SOURCES, AND AS WE MOVE FORWARD, I JUST WOULD -- I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE CHANNELING IT SO WE DO GET IT IN ONE FORMAT AND CONSTANT UPDATE WITH OUR CITY ADMINISTRATOR. IT IS A LEAP OF FAITH AND ONE THAT I WILL MAKE, BUT, YOU KNOW, WE -- YOU KNOW, I WILL JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT, I GUESS.
01:45:38.876: >> City Atty. Postema: LET ME AS SAY UNDER THIS SAME RULE 15, THEY RECOGNIZE THAT, AND FOR INDIVIDUAL COUNCILMEMBERS, YOU SHOULD ALL KNOW THAT THE COUNCIL SHALL HAVE THE POWER TO TERMINATE THE LOCAL STATE OF EMERGENCY AFTER THE SEVEN DAY PERIOD, THEY -- THEY COULD TERMINATE THAT. THE OTHER THING I WILL POINT OUT, AND I WILL WRITE THE COUNCIL SOME MORE ADVICE ABOUT THAT, IS THAT IT DOES UNDER A STATE OF LOCAL EMERGENCY ALLOW YOU TO HAVE AN EMERGENCY MEETING IN WHICH TIME YOU MIGHT WANT TO ENACT AN EMERGENCY ORDINANCE, AND THAT CAN BE DONE WITH ONE READING. YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO IT IN ONE READING, BUT IT CAN BE DONE. AND THERE MAY BE TIMES WHERE YOU WANT TO DO THAT. WE TALKED ABOUT CLOSING THE BARS OR DOING OTHER THINGS, AND SO SINCE YOU ALL SET ON VARIOUS COMMITTEES, YOU KNOW THAT THE PROCESS, YOU KNOW, WITH ORDINANCES, SOMETIMES, THEY ARE DRAFTED BY COMMITTEE, AND THEY COME HERE AND YOU HAVE TWO MEETINGS, YOU HAVE A PUBLIC HEARING, WELL, THERE'S AN EXPEDITED REASON TO DO IT AND IT GIVES THE COUNCIL THE ABILITY TO MAKE THAT. THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT THE MAYOR DOES BY HIMSELF TO ENACT AN ORDINANCE. THAT'S WITH THE COUNCIL. SO YOU ARE NOT SURRENDERING ANYTHING, BUT IT GIVES YOU AN ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT ISSUES AND WE DON'T KNOW. IT WON'T COME. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT EMERGENCY COUNCIL MEETINGS YOU WILL HAVE TO DO. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT ORDINANCES WILL HAVE TO BE DONE, BUT THAT'S THE POWER BY THIS DECLARATION.
01:47:20.311: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I APPRECIATE YOU EXPLAINING TO THIS AND LEARNING OPEN THE FLY. UNDER THIS DECLARATION, COUNCIL ITSELF HAS SPECIAL POWERS, ONE THAT YOU JUST DI DESCRIBED UNDER EMERGENCY POWERS.
01:47:43.100: >> City Atty. Postema: YES.
01:47:43.701: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? ACTUALLY, I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE ALONG TYPICALLY, BUT BEFORE DOING THIS, I WOULD LIKE TO SAY -- WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT THE -- WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT COVID-19 HERE AT THE COUNCIL TABLE, BOTH AT COUNCIL -- COUNCIL COMMUNICATION, MAYORAL COMMUNICATION AND IT POPPED UP A COUPLE OF TIMES THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THE EVENING AND, OF COURSE, YOU KNOW, RIGHT NOW, IT INFORMED ALL OF OUR LIVES AND SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS. YOU KNOW, JUST LOOKING OUTSIDE AT THE HALL, THERE ARE CHAIRS SPACED MORE THAN 6 FEET APART TO ENABLE ANYONE WHO WISHES TO COME TO DO SO SAFELY. THE COVID-19 IS A WEIGHTY TIME FOR THE COMMUNITY. AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME -- OF WHICH I'M AWARE SINCE I HAVE BEEN ON CITY COUNCIL AND CERTAINLY SINCE I WAS MAYOR WHERE THERE HAS BEEN EVEN THE REASONABLE PROSPECT OF THE DECLARATION OF A LOCAL STATE OF EMERGENCY. AND HERE IT'S A NO-BRAINER. YOU KNOW, WE ARE -- WE ARE LIVING THROUGH EXTRAORDINARY TIMES. I'M GRATEFUL TO HAVE STAFF TO WORK WITH US AND FOR US, AND GUIDE US DURING THESE EXTRAORDINARY TIMES. YOU KNOW, THE WORK BEING DONE BY THE MUNICIPAL ORGANIZATION TO SERVE THE COMMUNITY IN THE ORDER COURSE AND IN EMERGENCIES IS INCREDIBLE AND I JUST WANT TO SAY IT'S MY PLEASURE TO BE -- TO BE PART OF IT, AND I HOPE THAT FOLKS HERE FEEL THE SAME. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
01:49:27.571: >> Councilmember Hayner:  JUST BRIEFLY. I WON'T BE THE PERP THAT DOESN'T WORTH THIS BECAUSE WE COULD -- PERSON THAT DOESN'T SUPPORT THIS BECAUSE WE COULD SCRAPE UP JUST A QUORUM. WHAT I WILL DO IS TAKE SOLACE THAT WE ARE EXTENDING IT BEYOND SEVEN DAYS AND WE HAVE A MEETING IN 14 14 DAYS. I'M SURE IT WILL EXTEND -- I'M SURE IT WILL EXTEND BEYOND THAT, BUT, YOU KNOW, GENERALLY, I WOULD SAY THAT IT DOESN'T SIT WELL WITH ME TO HAVE AN OPEN-ENDED NOTION OF EMERGENCY POWERS FLOATING AROUND IN THE CITY. AND SO FOR THE PUBLIC OUT THERE WHO SHARES THOSE CONCERNS I WILL SAY THAT WE WILL BE BACK IN TWO WEEKS AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT IT THEN AND WE CAN ALSO CALL A MEETING TO TALK ABOUT IT IN THREE WEEKS AND TALK ABOUT AFTER THAT ALSO. SO I DON'T SEE THIS AS A COMPLETELY OPEN ENDED SITUATION. ALTHOUGH I WOULD APPRECIATE IT IF MR. POSTEMA THIS COULD -- THIS IS CHAPTER 15. ARE THERE ANY SPECIFIC SUBPARAGRAPHS OF INTEREST TO ME?
01:50:25.996: >> City Atty. Postema: I WILL SEND THAT NOT WHOLE COUNCIL, WHAT THE POWERS ARE. 327, 327. BUT SPECIFICALLY, ON THAT NOTE, EMERGENCY MEETING, SPECIAL MEETINGS, AS YOU KNOW, CAN BE CALLED BY THE MAYOR, OR THREE COUNCILMEMBERS. AND SO IT IS THREE WEEKS TO THE NEXT MEETING. BUT I THINK THAT THE WHOLE DESIGN OF THIS IS TO ACT FAST.
01:50:49.787: >> Councilmember Hayner: SURE.
01:50:52.656: >> City Atty. Postema: BUT TO ACTUALLY GET THE POWER P TO THE WHOLE COUNCIL AND IS NOTHING SHOULD BE A BRIDGING OR A CURTAILING OF THE COUNCIL, UNLESS SPECIFICALLY PROVIDED IN THIS SECTION AND I DID READ YOU ONE PROVISION THAT -- THAT SPECIFICALLY SAID SEVEN DAYS AND HAD TO DO WITH THE ROADS, FOR EXAMPLE. SO I WILL GIVE YOU ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE ON THIS, SO THE WHOLE COUNCIL AND YOU COULD HAVE IT ACCORDINGLY BUT THAT'S THE RATIONALE.
01:51:23.154: >> Councilmember Hayner: LET'S USE OUR POWERS FOR GOOD, PEOPLE.
01:51:27.091: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
01:51:28.392: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. ONE FINAL COMMENT. WHENEVER WE MAKE A DECLARATION OR EXTEND A DECLARATION THAT PROVIDES US OR OTHER AUTHORITY FIGURE WITH MORE POWERS, I THINK IT SHOULD BE DONE CAREFULLY. THERE'S NO ONE I WOULD TRUST MORE AT THE HELM IS MR. POSTEMA AND MR. CRAWFORD AND MAYOR TAYLOR, I THINK YOU WILL WORK TOGETHER TO KEEP US SAFE AS POSSIBLE. MAYOR TMAYOR TAILOR, I'M GLAD TE SOMEONE -- TAYLOR, I'M GLAD TO HAVE SOMEONE WHO WEIGHED ALL PERSPECTIVES BOTH INTERNALLY TO THE ORGANIZATION BUT ALSO EXTERNALLY WITH EPIDEMIOLOGISTS AND CAME WITH THAT DECISION, QUICKLY WORKING OVER THE WEEKEND BUT DELIBERATIVELY AND THOUGHTFULLY. SO I TRUST YOU IN THE UTMOST TO TREAT THESE POWERS WITH RESPECT AND TO DO SO IN THE INTEREST OF THE PUBLIC.
01:52:22.780: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
01:52:24.148: >> Councilmember Grand: THAT'S ALMOST PRECISELY WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY, I WOULD JUST ADD ON THAT WE DO HAVE A LOT OF EXPERTS IN OUR COMMUNITY. I KNOW THE CITY HAS BENEFITED FROM SOME OF THESE DIRECTLY AND ALSO THAT WE HAVE SEEN PATTERNS OF WHAT'S WORKED AND WHAT HAS NOT WORKED, IN OTHER COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD. AND SO LET'S USE THOSE MODELS TO OUR BENEFIT. TO OUR COMMUNITY AND ALSO WE KNOW THAT OTHER COMMUNITIES WILL BE LOOKING TO US TO SEE WHAT WE ARE DOING. SO I TRUST THAT IT WILL BE USED WELL. AND THIS DEFINITELY MAKES IT WORTH COMING OUT HERE TONIGHT.
01:52:59.416: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER LUMM? SORRY.
01:53:03.621: >> Councilmember Lumm: THAT'S FINE. I SUPPORT THIS, AND I WAS JUST CONFUSED BECAUSE I DID NOT EVEN REALIZE THAT THIS WAS BEING BROUGHT FORWARD UNTIL AFTER THE MEETING STARTED AND I GUESS WHEN IT WAS PLACED ON LEGISTAR, WE WERE IN EXECUTIVE SESSION FOR MR. POSTEMA'S EVALUATION, AND SO I ALSO APPRECIATE YOU ARE GOING TO FOLLOW UP WITH THIS INFORMATION -- WITH A MEMO AN EXPLANATORY MEMO AND THE ADDED INFORMATION FROM CHAPTER 15. THIS IS OBVIOUSLY NEW T TERRAIN AND I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW -- THAT THE TRACK RECORD IS -- COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN AND OTHERS HAVE OBSERVED OF YOU, MR. CRAWFORD AND MAYOR TAYLOR, MR. POSTEMA, AND, AGAIN, YOUR WHOLE EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAM THAT YOU HAVE -- THE MANAGEMENT TEAM THAT YOU HAVE ASSEMBLED HAS BEEN OUTSTANDING. AND YOU HAVE BEEN -- YOU HAVE BEEN TAKING NECESSARY ACTIONS IN A VERY NIMBLE, YOU THOUGH, THOUGHTFUL PROACTIVE WAY AND -- AND YOU HAVE BEEN WORKING AT THIS. YOU HAVE ALL BEEN WORKING AT THIS PRETTY MUCH NONSTOP SINCE -- SINCE WE WERE IN THIS PANDEMIC ENVIRONMENT. SO I DON'T THINK THIS WILL BE ABUSED IN ANY WAY, AND IT'S NECESSARY, I THINK. I MEAN, I DON'T THINK -- IT IS NECESSARY. I DON'T QUESTION THAT IT IS. I'M SURE OUR COMMUNITY WILL BENEFIT FROM TAKING THIS ACTION AS WELL. SO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR ACTING NIMBLY AND, YOU KNOW, WE ALL, OF COURSE, HOPE THAT THIS DOESN'T EXTEND TOO LONG INTO THE FUTURE, BUTZ WE'LL BE PREPARED. -- BUT WE'LL BE PREPARED. I ASSUME THAT ON THE STATE LEVEL, AS WELL, WHERE THE GOVERNOR MADE AN EMERGENCY DECLARATION AND NOW THE LEGISLATURE IS LOOKING AT GOING INTO RECESS FOR A MONTH, I THINK, I GUESS THAT'S NOT YET BEEN CONFIRMED BUT THEY TOO WILL BE NEEDING TO ACT, YOU KNOW, IN A SIMILAR FASHION WITH ASSIGNING AUTHORITY TO THE GOVERNOR AND, YOU KNOW, HER TEAM IN THE ABSENCE OF THE ELECTED OFFICIALS BEING ABLE TO BE CONSULTED ON VARIOUS STEPS THAT NEED TO BE TAKEN AGAIN AND IN A NIMBLE, FLEXIBLE, QUICK WAY. SO AGAIN, THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. I LOOK FORWARD TO GETTING THE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, AND THANK YOU.
01:55:35.773: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. DO WE HAVE COMMUNICATIONS TODAY FROM OUR CITY -- OH, DB- -- OH, THAT'S AN -- NO, NO, THAT'S NOT. IT WAS EIGHT VOTE APPROVAL. DB-2.

01:57:07.564: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WOULD LIKE TO SAY ON CA-14, IF TRASH CANS ARE GOING IN THE D.D.A. DISTRICT, THE D.A.A. SHOULD BE PAYING FOR THEM. THANK YOU.
01:57:17.141: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER COMMUNICATION FROM COUNCIL, COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:57:19.443: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: WELL, THANKS. AND THANKS TO MY COLLEAGUES TORE MAKING -- FOR MAKING IT OUT HERE TONIGHT. IT'S A SOMEWHAT UNCOMFORTABLE POSITION TO BE IN, BUT WE ARE ELECTED OFFICIALS AND I THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO COME AND DO THE WORK OF THE PEOPLE, IN THE FACE OF THE THREAT THAT WE ALL FACE:  I APPRECIATE STAFF BEING HERE TONIGHT ANSWERING THE QUESTIONS THAT WE HAD. I HOPE THE AUDIENCE AT HOME WAS SATISFIED AT LEAST TO A REASONABLE EXTENT THAT THE CITY IS WORKING TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES THAT WE'RE FACING, BUT THERE ARE OTHER AGENCIES OUT THERE THAT HAVE THE ENFORCEMENT, THE SYSTEMS IN PLACE, AND THE EXPERTS THAT DO A LOT O
