SEEING NO ONE ALL IN FAVOR RAISE YOUR HAND OR SAY YES OR AYE. WHATEVER FLOATS YOUR BOAT. THAT IS EVERYONE. SO THE MOTION CARRIES. 6 ARE REPORTS OF COUNCIL AND COMPLAINING PLANNING COMMISSION OFFICERS AND THE PLACE ALL WRITTEN COMMUNICATIONS LIVE. THERE'S MANY PACKETS RECEIVED AND ADDED ON TO ON TO THE WEBSITE AND EMAILED TO US TODAY SO I WAS JUST CATCHING UP BEFORE THIS. I'M SURE YOU ARE TOO. FIRST UP IN TERMS OF THE REPORT, COUNCIL MEMBER DISCH DO YOU HAVE A REPORT FOR US?
00:03:43.510: >> COMMISSIONER DISCH? SORRY.
00:03:45.446: >> WHAT DID COUNCIL DO LAST NIGHT? WHICH TOOK A WHILE. THERE WERE SOME TOWNSHIP ANNEXATIONS WE APPROVED. AS YOU WOULD IMAGINE. MR. LENART, REMIND ME WHAT WERE THE HIGHLIGHTS?
00:04:00.894: >> SURE. I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THERE WERE THREE ACTIONS OF THE PLANNING COMMISSION HAD BEEN INVOLVED WITH PREVIOUSLY. ALL ARE FIRST ZONING, FIRST READING OF ZONINGS FROM ANNEXED PROPERTIES ONE WAS 2511 NEWPORT WHICH WAS PROPERTY OWNER INITIATED. THEN TWO THAT WERE CITY INITIATED REZONINGS RESULTING FROM ONE WAS THE DONATION OF OPEN SPACE THAT WAS ORIGINALLY PART OF THE WOOD BURY CLUB APARTMENTS THEN ANNEX APARTMENTS NOW OWL CREEK APARTMENTS ONYX ROAD, THAT WAS PART OF THE SITE PLAN SO OPEN SPACE WAS DONATED TO THE CITY. THE PROPOSED ACTION WAS FIRST RELATED TO REASONING ON THAT LAND PURCHASE OF A LAND TO ADD TO THE OKAY WOODS NATURE AREA PURCHASED BY CITY PARKS AND (INAUDIBLE) SO ALL THOSE ACTIONS AND THEN THERE WAS ALSO DISCUSSION AND I WASN'T AT THE MEET, I DON'T KNOW IF COUNCIL WOULD LIKE TO ADD ANYTHING, THERE WAS ALSO DISCUSSION OF A RESOLUTION REGARDING 2857 PACKARD ROAD I BELIEVE. POTENTIALLY DIRECTING CITY STAFF TO CONSIDER SOME ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS MOVING FORWARD ON THAT PROPERTY.
00:05:12.266: >> YES. THERE WAS A DISCUSSION MERELY OF EXPLORING WHETHER IT IS EVEN POSSIBLE FOR US TO REOPEN THE CONSENT JUDGMENT AND CONSIDER AN ALTERNATIVE SITE PLAN. AS Y'ALL KNOW, THE OWNER OF THE PROPERTY CAN WORK WITH ANY ALTERNATIVE, THE ORIGINAL DEVELOPER SEEMS TO HAVE DECIDED NOT TO DEVELOP. AND SO IT'S OPEN FOR THAT PROPERTY OWNER TO WORK WITH ANY OTHER DEVELOPER ON THE APPROVED SITE PLAN. BUT THE QUESTION WE HAVE SOME THOUGHTS ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF A DIFFERENT SITE PLAN AND THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THAT IS POSSIBLE TO DO. AND IF THAT'S POSSIBLE TO DO THEN WE ARE AUTHORIZING STAFF TO PROCEED WITH THOSE KINDS OF CONVERSATIONS THAT YOU HAVE. THERE IS NO PLAN AS YET. SO THIS IS A VERY PRELIMINARY LOOK INTO THE POSSIBILITY OF OPENING THE POSSIBILITY OF CONVERSATIONS.
00:06:17.898: >> PEOPLE WHOA DON'T KNOW THE ADDRESS, THIS IS THE PROJECT THAT WAS BY EASY STREET BECAUSE THAT STICKS IN MY MIND. WITH ALL THE BURNT OAKS, RIGHT? SO THERE'S A SITE PLAN THAT WAS APPROVED, THEY HAVE THREE YEARS TO BUILD IT, THAT'S HOW NORMAL SITE PLANS WORK.
00:06:36.316: >> YEAH THE -- ACTUALLY THE SITE PLAN WASN'T APPROVED BY THE CITY HOWEVER IT WAS APPROVED BY CONSENT JUDGMENT BETWEEN THE CITY AND THE PROPERTY OWNER. SO AND IT HAS -- THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION. I GUESS I DON'T KNOW IF IT HAS ANY DIFFERENT EFFECT BASED ON THAT OF THE THREE YEAR TIME PERIOD. I WOULD HAVE TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT BUT CERTAINLY PROBABLY AT LEAST THAT TIME FRAME.
00:07:00.774: >> THAT'S THE NORMAL WAY FOR PEOPLE -- WE SEE THEM ON THE ONE SIDE BUT NOT NECESSARILY HEAR ABOUT THEM LATER. GREATS. MR. LENART DID YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD?
00:07:13.754: >> JUST A COUPLE OF ITEMS. NORMALLY WE DON'T KEEP YOU APPRISED BUT GIVEN THE SIZE OF THE PROJECT WE RECEIVED WORD FROM THE STATE THAT THE ANNEXATION PORTION OF THE BALHALLAH PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN APPROVED. THAT WAS THE FIRST STEP YOU RECALL IN ANNEXATION REZONING REQUEST AND SITE PLAN AND NOW THAT THAT ACTION HAS TAKEN PLACE THAT OPENS THE DOOR FOR ZONING AND SITE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO CITY COUNCIL. THAT WILL BE COMING I ANTICIPATE THE NEXT MONTH OR TWO. GENERALLY. THEN JUST PROGRAMMING FOR THE UPCOMING WORKING SESSION NEXT WEEK I ANTICIPATE CONTINUING OUR CONVERSATION ABOUT PROPOSED AMENDMENTS AROUND TRANSIT ZONING AND SITE PLANNER B THRESHOLDS WITH THE FULL COMMISSION AT THAT ON SESSION.
00:08:06.606: >> THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMISSIONER OFFICERS OR LIAISONS THAT HAVE -- THAT HAVE IN HUG TO REPORT? -- ANYTHING TO REPORT? COMMISSIONER?
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
00:09:38.865: >> ANYONE ELSE? THE I'LL REPORT OUT THAT THE ORDINANCE REVISIONS COMMITTEE MET LAST WEEK. WE TALKED ABOUT MOST OF THE TIM WAS SPENT ON THE TWO ITEMS THAT ARE BEFORE US TODAY P. BUT THERE WERE- WE ALSO STAFF KIND OF SHAREDOME UPDATES ON THE SITE PLAN REVIE THRESHOLDS, THERE'S A NICEABLE, S SO TO HELP U UNDERSND HOW THINGS CURRELY DISCUSSIONBOUT WHAT MIGHT MOVE DOWN TO LOW LEVELS OF REVW. AN INITI DRA OR SUBSEQUENTAD DRAFT TO SHARE WIT US AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT GOT ON THE TABLE WAS WHAT CORRIDORS SO THAT SOMETHING THAT ORC DISCUSSED AND I IMAGINE THAT WE'LL BE PART OF OUR WORKING SESSION. NEXT WEEK. SO THOSE WHO MAY BE WATCHING US OR ARE FOLLOWING THESE ISSUES AND WANT TO TUNE IN THAT, IS ONE THAT IS NOT TELEVISED SO YOU'LL CALL IN TO THAT. BUT ON THE WEBSITE OUR AGENDA WILL BE POSTED AND YOU WILL BE ABLE TO GET THAT INFORMATION FOR HOW TO DIAL IN AND LISTEN IN AND MAKE ANY COMMENTS YOU WOULD LIKE TO THE WORKING SESSION THROUGH THE CITY WEBSITE. NO ONE ELSE HAS COMMUNICATIONS. OKAY. WE ARE ON TO ITEM NUMBER 7. THIS IS PUBLIC COMMENT OPPORTUNITY. IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PERSONS TO SPEAK FOR UP TO THREE MINUTES ABOUT AN ISSUE THAT IS NOT LISTED AS A PUBLIC HEARING ON THIS AGENDA. SO WE DO HAVE DEDICATED PUBLIC HEARING ON THE PROPOSED SHORT TERM RENTAL AMENDMENTS AND WE HAVE A SEPARATE DEDICATED PUBLIC HEARING ON THE PROPOSED ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT AMENDMENTS. SO THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO TALK ABOUT THOSE THINGS. IF YOU WISH TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION ON ANY OTHER MATTER, NOW IS THE APPROPRIATE TIME. TO COMMENT ON THOSE OTHER MATTERS YOU CAN CALL (877)853-5247 AND THEN THE MEETING ID IS 92916202435. CITY STAFF WILL SELECT CALLERS WHO DIGITALLY RAISE THEIR HAND, YOU DO THAT BY PRESSING STAR 9 ON YOUR PHONE. YOU WILL GET AN AUTOMATED MESSAGE THAT YOU ARE BEING ABLE TO SPEAK, PLEASE MOVE TO A QUIET AREA AND MUTE ANY BACKGROUND SOUNDS SO THAT WE CAN HEAR YOU CLEARLY. PLEASE ALSO STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS FOR THE RECORD. LOOKS LIKE WE DO HAVE SOME CALLERS ON THE LINE ONE WITH THEIR HANDS UP THIS IS THE OPPORTUNITY IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING MATTERS TO ADDRESS BEFORE PLANNING COMMISSION BUT NOT THE TIME TO TALK ABOUT SHORT TERM RENTALS OR ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS. CALMER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 411, THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
00:12:43.917: >> THANK YOU, MR. LENART. THIS IS -- AND COMMISSIONERS. THIS IS JAMES DEMOORE, I LIVE AT 2771 MAPLE WOOD AVENUE IN ANN ARBOR, 48104 NOT FAR FROM THE PACKARD ROAD SITE DISCUSSED BY COMMISSIONER DISCH A MOMENT AGO. JUST A BRIEF ERA TA SLIGHTLY IN TERMS OF WHAT WAS DISCUSSED HERE JUST NOW, THERE ISN'T A FORMAL SITE PLAN BEING DISCUSSED IN TERMS OF A DISCUSSIONS PER SE IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT THE CONSENT JUDGMENT. BUT I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THERE IS CONCEPTUAL SITE PLAN OUT THERE THAT HAS BEEN DISCUSSED BY A PROMINENT PROGRESSIVE DEVELOPER AND ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN CONSENTS HAVE BEEN PUT TOGETHER AND HAS BEEN SUBJECT OF GREAT INTEREST WITHIN THE IMMUNITY CERTAINLY BY THE NEIGHBORHOOD. AND I THINK THIS IS PROBABLY THE IMPETUS FOR THIS CHANGE AND CERTAINLY IF IT DOES GO FORWARD, IT WOULD PROTECT THE NATURAL FEATURES, THE TREES THAT THE CITY TRIED TO PROTECT IN TERMS OF THE PROCESS AND SUBSEQUENTLY DIDN'T HAPPEN WITH THE CONSENT JUDGMENT BUT JUST THE MAKE THAT OUT THERE. THE MAIN REASON I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU TONIGHT IS THAT I'M NOT GOING TO SPEAK ON THIS TWO PARTICULAR PROPOSALS PER SE BUT AS A FORMER PLANNING COMMISSIONERRER WHAT YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU ARE CHANGES TO THE ZONING CODE THAT WOULD HAVE IMPACTS IN THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL SYSTEMS. AND IMPACT ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING. NOT SAYING THESE CHANGES ARE GOOD OR BAD. I THINK THERE'S SOME THINGS THAT ARE PROMISED WITHIN THEM. BUT THEY ARE RATHER SWEEPING. AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT REQUIRED BETTER NOTICE. I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT AFFECTS THE ENTIRE CITY. I THINK THE CITY SHOULD HAVE BEEN NOTICED BETTER THAN WHAT WAS NECESSARILY GIVEN HERE IN THIS FAIRLY SHORT ORDER. I REALIZE THE COMMITTEE IS WORKING UNDER SOME DIRECTION TRYING TO MOVE QUICKLY BUT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO HAVE MAYBE A GREATER I THINK NOTICE IN TERMS OF WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. I ALSO THINK THIS CHANGES OUR -- THESE CHANGES ARE IMPORTANT ENOUGH THEY NEED TO BE FOLDED INTO THE ENTIRE MASTER PLAN REVISION PROCESS WHICH IS THE WHOLE COMMUNITY WIDE EFFORT. AND I THINK THESE THINGS SHOULDN'T BE DONE PIECE MEAL AND I REALIZED THERE'S PRESSURES TO MOVE AHEAD WITH THESE THINGS BUT IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT THEY PUT INTO THE FORMAL PROCESS IN AND OF ITSELF. LASTLY REGARDS TO ORDINANCE REVISION COMMITTEE I HAVE SPOKEN TO YOU BEFORE ON THIS MATTER. I REALLY THINK THAT YOU ARE ALL VERY QUALIFIED PEOPLE HERE AND PLAY PLANNING STAFF IS QUALIFIED BUT SOMETHING SWEEPING AS STAFF RECOMMENDATION EVEN ON ZONING CHANGES IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE THE PROS AND CONS SHOULD BE STATED, BUT THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION SHOULD -- IS NOT SOMETHING CLIENT STAFF SHOULDN'T DO IT, IT SHOULD COME FROM COMMISSIONERS ITSELF,, I WOULD ASK THE ORC REVIEW THE ORDINANCE THAT REQUIRES THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION THIS NEEDS TO BE REMOVED. I THINK IT HAS LEGAL IMPLICATIONS IN TERMS OF THE SITE PLAN PROCESS.
00:16:04.684: >> THANK YOU.
00:16:07.420: >> WITH THAT THANK YOU FOR CONSIDERING MY REMARKS.
00:16:09.255: >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
00:16:23.236: >> CALLER WITH PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 534. CALLER WITH PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 534, THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSIONER.
00:16:34.514: >> THIS IS TOM STALLBURG CALLING FROM LOWER TOWN. FIRST THING I WOULD LIKE THE TALK ABOUT IS THE WEBER PROPERTY, THE ONE ON PACKARD ROAD. THE UNDERLYING ZONING THERE PRIOR TO CONSENT JUDGMENT IS R 1E, WE ONLY HAVE A COUPLE OF THOSE AROUND TOWN. THEY DON'T SEEM TO BE WORKING THE WAY WE MAY BE HAD HOPED THEY WOULD. AND I AND OTHERS HAVE BEEN REQUESTING FOR SOME TIME THAT THE PLANNING COMMISSION MAYBE NEED COUNCIL DIRECTION IN ORDER TO DO THIS. R 1E NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT, IT'S PROBLEMATIC. AND I'LL LET YOU TAKE THAT FROM THERE. TONIGHT WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT SOME THINGS I HAVE INTENDED TO SPEAK PUBLIC HEARINGS TONIGHT. BUT THERE HAVE BEEN SOME PROCESS AND PUBLIC POLICY ISSUES SO I WANT TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE GET OURSELVES IN IN TO TROUBLE WITH PROCESS AND PUBLIC POLICY ISSUES AND SPECIFICALLY I'LL GO BACK TO LOWER TOWN AS AN EXAMPLE THERE IS A WHOLE LOT OF THINGS WRONG WITH LOWER TOWN. BUT LET ME FOCUS ON SOMETHING SPECIFIC HERE, IT WOULD BE THE MASTER PLAN, REVIEW ISSUE OF IT. WE HAVE A DEVELOPER WHETHER OR NOT WANTED TO DEVELOP A RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT BUT THE PROBLEM WAS IT WAS MASTER PLANNED FOR A MIXED USE URBAN VILLAGE. SO WHAT SWY SHOULD HAVE DONE INSTEAD OF ENTERTAINING APPLICATION FOR 100% RESIDENTIAL PROJECT, 99.5 RESIDENTIAL PROJECT AS A PLANNING LETTER SAID, IT WAS A RESIDENTIAL PROJECT BUT ACCESSORY COMMERCIAL USE. WE SHOULD HAVE A MASTER PLAN DIVISION FOR LOWER TOWN. LOWER TOWN HAS A SECTION IN THERE IN THE MASTER PLAN, I WAS ONE OF THE PEOPLE I THINK EARLY 2000S THAT PARTICIPATED IN THAT. SO WHY DIDN'T WE DO THE MASTER PLAN REVISION PRIOR TO ENTERTAINING THAT APPLICATION FOR RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT? ONE LIKELY WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED SO WAIT A MINUTE. WE'RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE COMMUNITY DISCUSSION. ISN'T THAT WHAT A MASTER PLAN DISCUSSION IS? THAT WOULDN'T SATISFY THE DEVELOPER SO WHY DIDN'T THE CITY DO IT? WELL, SAY WE DID. IF WE REVISE THE MASTER PLAN IT WAS POPULAR MIXED USE CONCEPT THERE. SO I DON'T THINK THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN GONE THROUGH BUT IF IT DID AND WE WERE WILLING TO CHANGE THE MASTER PLAN AND ENTERTAIN A RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT THERE, THEN WE HAVE OUR R 4E THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE APPROPRIATE ONE IN THE MOST DENSE RESIDENTIAL CATEGORY. SO WHY DIDN'T THAT HAPPEN? WHY DIDN'T WE HAVE MASTER PLAN REVISIONINGS AND END UP HAVING APPLICATION FOR R 4E? PLANNED RESCISSION THAT'S WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED. THEY WOULD HAVE ASKED FOR R 4E BUT THEY DIDN'T WANT THAT SO WE SKIPPED THE MASTER PLAN REVISION PROCESS AND WENT IN WITH A MA'AM OF AN APPLICATION THAT ENDED UP WITH A CITY LOSING OUT ON 93 UNITS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND $9 MILLION TO THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUND, THE CHOICE OF THE DEVELOPER WHICH ONE BUT HE GOT OUT OF THAT BECAUSE WE DIDN'T FOLLOW THE PROCESS. THERE'S A BIG PROBLEM WITH NOT FOLLOWING THE PROCESS AND THAT'S GOING TO COME UP AGAIN LATER TONIGHT. THANK YOU.
00:19:38.464: >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANYONE ELSE ON THE PHONE WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION DURING PUBLIC COMMENT? PRESS "*" 9 ON YOUR PHONE TO TICK DIGITALLY RAISE YOUR HAND. ALL RIGHT. I WILL MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER 8 WHICH IS PUBLIC HEARINGS FOR THE NEXT BUSINESS MEETING.
00:20:08.361: >> WE HAVE NO NEW MEETINGS SCHEDULED FOR THE NEXT PUBLIC BUSINESS MEETING.
00:20:12.331: >> ARE THERE THINGS COMING BACK ARE WE STILL WAITING OR WHAT THE STATUS OF THE THIRD WEDNESDAY OF THE THIRD TUESDAY OF THE MONTH IS?
00:20:18.838: >> I THINK AT THIS POINT I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING SCHEDULED BUT BEFORE I MAKE A RECOMMENDATION I WANTED TO SEE WHAT THE OUTCOMES WERE OF THE EVENING.
00:20:28.481: >> VERY GOOD. THAT MAKES SENSE. SO WE'LL CHECK BACK IN AT THE END OF THE EVENING. OR ELSE KEEP YOUR EARS OUT -- EYES OUT FOR AN EMAIL LATER. OKAY. ITEM NUMBER 9A. THIS IS PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO TABLE 5.15-1. THERE'S MANY TABLES. THIS IS THE SHORT TERM RENTAL USES AMENDMENTS. I'LL READ THE FULL THING LATER ON BUT I'M E NOT GOING TO GO THROUGH IT RIGHT NOW. Z
00:21:02.882: >> SO I'M GOING TO PULL UP JUST A BRIEF OVERVIEW IF YOU CAN CONFIRM COMMISSIONERS ONCE ABLE TO SEE THAT. FIRST ITEM FOR CONSIDERATION THIS EVENING IS PROPOSED ONE OF TWO SETS OF PROPOSED UDC AMENDMENTS FIRST REGARDING SHORT TERM RENTALS A LITTLE BACKGROUND FOR THE PLANNING COMMISSION. YOU HEARD CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS EMERGENT ISSUE IN THE CITY BUT YOU HAEN'T HAD A LOT OF SPECIFIC RELATIONSHIP TO IT TO DATE. PRIOR TO SEPTEMBER 2020 UPON PREVIOUS DIRECTION OF CITY COUNCIL CITY STAFF CONDUCTED A SERIES OF SESSIONS ACROSS THE CITY SOLICITING FEEDBACK ABOUT POTENTIAL SHORT TERM REGULATIONS AND ULTIMATELY PRESENTED OPTION'S TO IS THE CITY COUNCIL WHICH CULMINATED IN ADOPTION OF CHAPTER 97 SHO TERM RENTAL LICENSING ORDINANCE. THIS IS A NEW ORDINANCE IN THE CITY CODET HIGH LEVE DINED WH SHORT TERM RENTALS ARE AND DIFFERENT TYS. IT ESTABLISHES LICENSI REQUIREMENTS THINGS LE THAT A FECAN BEHARGED, THE TYPE OF INRMATION THA NEEDS TO BE IT'S AN ANAL LICEN.CY, I ALSNCDES PROSIS WHEN AT LICEN COULD BE REVOK SEON AIVITIES OCCURRING A THE PROPERTY AND PRINCIPALLY IS IT IDENTIFIES TYPES OF SHORT TERM RENTALS THAT WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR A LICENSE BY AREAS IN THE CITY. SPECIFICALLY IT IDENTIFIED THE PRINCIPLE RESIDENCES CAN RECEIVE A SHORT TERM RENTAL LICENSE IN ANY RESIDENTIAL OR MIXED USE DISTRICT, THAT IS WHEN IT IS ACCESSORY TO A PRINCIPLE RESIDENT. RESIDENCE. A NON-PRINCIPLE RESIDENCE OR PROPERTY OWNER THAT DOESN'T RESIDE AT THE PROPERTY IS ELIGIBLE FOR A SHORT TERM RENTAL LICENSE IN MIXED USE AREAS ONLY. ASP THAT IN DECEMBER 2020 THE CITY DIRECTED STAFF AND PLANNING COMMISSION TO CONSIDER PROPOSED AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD ENABLE PRE-EXISTING NON-PRINCIPLE RESIDENTS SHORT TERM RENTALS THAT MAY HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED IN RESIDENTIAL AREAS PRIOR PRIOR TO EFFECTIVE DATE OF CHAPTER 97 ORDINANCE TO CONTINUE AND APPLY THOSE PROVISIONS PROSPECT ACTIVELY TO NEW SHORT TERM RENTALS GOING FORWARD. THIS IS A PRETTY SIMPLE DIRECTION TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION AND STAFF. THE CITY COUNCIL MADE VIA ADOPTION OF CHAPTER 97 POLICY DECISIONS HOW THE SHORT TERM RENTAL SHOULD BE REGULATED, THAT THEY SHOULD BE DISTINCTLY REGULATED BY BASED ON OWNERSHIP IN DIFFERENT AREAS IN THE CITY BUT SPECIFICALLY ASKED THIS DIRECTION FOR US TO CONSIDER IF WE WANTED TO PROVIDE AN AVENUE FOR PRE-ESTABLISHED NON-RESIDENT SHORT TERM RENTALS THAT ARE IN RESIDENTIAL AREAS TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE IN SPITE OF NEW PROVISIONS OF CHAPTER 97. SO THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS I THINK ARE ACTUALLY FAIRLY SIMPLE FROM A ZONING UDC PERSPECTIVE. AND THESE ARE OF COURSE ALL INCLUDED IN THE MATERIAL THE PACKET OF MATERIALS BUT THE FIRST IS TO ESTABLISH SHORT TERM RENTAL NON-PRINCIPLE RESIDENTS AS A PERMITTED USE IN THE MIXED USE ZONING DISTRICT TS. SO JUST THAT, ADDING THAT USE THEN THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS ADD TO ACCESSORY USE, THIS IS NOW THE PERMITTED ACCESSORY USE TABLE AND IT IDENTIFIES TWO TYPES OF SHORT TERM RENTALS FOR PRINCIPLE RESIDENTS. THAT IS WHEN YOU HAVE SITUATION WHERE A PROPERTY IS THE HOME AND PRINCIPLE RESIDENCE OF A RESIDENT, THEY CAN ADD ACCESSORY USE OF THAT HOUSING UNDERTAKE A SHORT TERM RENTAL PRINCIPLE RESIDENTS HOME STAY, THAT WOULD BE WHERE YOU MIGHT PROVIDE A SHORT TERM RENTAL TO AN EXTRA BEDROOM WITHIN YOUR DWELLING OUTON SOME INFREQUENT OR FREQUENT BASIS. OR A SHORT TERM RENTAL PRINCIPAL RESIDENCE WHOLE HOUSE, THAT WOULD BE A SIMILAR SITUATION ON SHORT TERM BASIS AND YOU AS PROPERTY RESIDENT DON'T STAY MANY THE PROPERTY DURING THE DURATION OF THAT SHORT TERM RENTAL. SO THE FORMER IS THAT RESIDENT IS PRESENT THROUGHOUT THE TIME OF THE RENTAL, THE LATTER IS THAT RESIDENT IS NOT PRESENT FOR THE TERM OF THAT RENTAL. THE PROPOSED AMENDMENT THE MEAT OF THAT CORRECT FROM THE DECEMBER RESOLUTION SUBPOENA PROPOSED HERE. IT WOULD BE ADDING A SPECIFIC NON-CONFORMING SHORT TERM RENTAL NON-PRINCIPLE RESIDENCE WHICH WOULD SAY THAT IF SUCH A SHORT TERM RENTAL WERE ESTABLISHED IN A RESIDENTIAL ZONING DISTRICT PRIOR TO MARCH 1, 2021 IT SHALL BE CONSIDERED A LEGAL NON-CONFORMING USE AND MAY BE MAINTAINED SUBJECT TO THE SECTION. WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT IT WOULD BE AFORDED ALL THE SAME NOT LEGAL NON-CONFORMING STATUS AS ANY USE WOULD IN THAT CATEGORY OR ANY OTHER USE AND ANY OTHER DISTRICT IN THE CITY. THAT MEANS THAT THAT USE CAN CONTINUE INDEFINITELY AT THAT PROPERTY REGARDLESS OF THE CHANGE IN OWNERSHIP, OF THAT PROPERTY, HOWEVER, THE RESTRICTIONS OF USE WOULD BE THAT IF THAT USE WERE DISCONTINUED FOR A PERIOD OF TIME SPECIFICALLY ONE YEAR, THAT NON-CONFORMING STATUS FOR THAT USE WOULD BE LOST. SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S CLEAR, THAT THE USE AND THE DISCONTINUATION OF THE USE WOULD COMPROMISE THE LONG TERM CONTINUATION OF IT, A CHANGE IN OWNERSHIP SO LONG AS IT WAS STILL BEING USED IN THE SAME MANNER WOULD NOT IMPACT THE NON-CONFORMING STATUS OF THAT PROPERTY. THEN WEAPON ADDED PROPOSED CHANGES ADD DEFINITIONS.  THESE ARE LARGELY TAKING DEFINITION THE CHAPTER 97 IDENTIFYING A PERMANENT RESIDENT AND A PERMANENT RESIDENCE AND THE TYPES OF SHORT TERM RENTALS THAT I GENERALLY DESCRIBED PREVIOUSLY. THERE IS ONE CORRECTION I NEED TO MAKE THAT I AN ERROR I MADE IN DISCUSSION AT THE ORDINANCE REVISIONS COMMITTEE MEETING. I WANT TO CLARIFY THAT FOR THOSE COMMISSIONERS THAT WERE THERE AND ANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO LISTENED TO THAT. AT THAT TIME I WAS EMPHASIZING THE POSSIBILITY, THE EMPHASIS THAT A PRINCIPLE RESIDENCE WAS THE DETERMINANTTIVE FACTOR OF THE ABILITY TO DO A SHORT TERM RENTAL. THAT WAS INCORRECT. UNDER THE CURRENT STRUCTURE OF AN ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT ORDINANCE, THAT PROPOSED LANGUAGE THAT RESTRICTS YOU CANNOT LEASE THAT FOR LESS THAN 30 DAYS PREVENT USE OF ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT AS SHORT TERM RENTAL REGARDLESS OF TENANT SAY OF IT, THAT IS OWNER OF THE PROPERTY OR TENANT TO THAT PROPERTY. THAT ZONING PROVISION WOULD NOT ENABLE THE CITY TO -- TO THE ADU BECAUSE OF THAT PROVISION. IT WOULDN'T ELIMINATE THE ABILITY FOR SHORT TERM RENTAL TO BE LICENSED FOR A SINGLE FAMILY DWELLING OF THE SAME PROPERTY. THAT'S WHAT THIS GRAPHIC IS INTENDED -- INTENDING TO SUMMARIZE. IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCE, THE ADU WOULDN'T BE PERMITTED WITH THE CITY DEFINING SHORT SHORT TERM RENTALS HAS A LEASE LESS THAN 30 DAYS THE ADU AS CURRENTLY CANNOT BE LEASE LESS THAN 30 DAYS THEY WOULDN'T BE PERMITTED. THE SINGLE FAMILY DWELLING IF A PRINCE PREGNANT RESIDENCE THAT IS EITHER THE OWN OWNER OF THE PROMPT OR TENANT OF THE PROMPT USING THAT SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENCE AS THEIR RESIDENCE, THEY CAN AVAIL THEMSELVES AS THE ACCESSORY SHORT TERM RENTALS IN THE RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS, IF THERE IS A NON-PRINCIPLE RESIDENT OPERATOR OF THAT SHORT TERM RENTAL ONLY PERMISSIBLE IN MIXED USE ZONING AREAS NOT RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS AND THE PROPOSED NON-CONFORMING LANGUAGE JUST PRESENTED THAT WOULD HAVE THE AFFECT OF A SUBSET OF THOSE PROPERTIES POTENTIALLY BEING LEGALLY NOB CONFORMING AND ABLE TO OPERATE IN RESIDENTIAL ZONES. THAT WOULD OF COURSE BE DEPENDENT UPON THE ADOPTION OF THAT LANGUAGE AND THOSE PROPERTIES DEMONSTRATING THAT THEY WERE OPERATING PRIOR TO THAT DEADLINE TO THE SATISFACTION OF THE CITY. SO I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS, EITHER NOW OR CERTAINLY AFTER THE PUBLIC HEARING.
00:30:45.597: >> COMMISSIONER ABRONS AND COMMISSIONER DISCH.
00:30:47.966: >> THANK YOU, MY FIRST QUESTION IS IN REGARDS TO THE RETENTION OF NON-CONFORMING USE UPON SALE OF POSED TO USE CHANGING THE NON-CONFORMING USE. IS THAT SPECIFIC TO THIS ORDINANCE OR IS THAT TYPICAL WAY IN WHICH NON-CONFORMING USE --
00:31:09.121: >> THAT IS A TYPICAL WAY -- THAT IS A TYPICAL REGULATION. OF HOW THAT APPLIES.
00:31:18.831: >> IS THAT A LEGAL CONCERN OR IS THAT A STANDARD PRACTICE? Z
00:31:30.843: >> I WOULD SAY STANDARD PRACTICE BECAUSE IT IS SORT OF THE NATURE OF ZONING. THAT IS WHEN ZONING IS ESTABLISHED IT IS PROSPECTIVE. SO THERE ARE CERTAIN RIGHTS PROVIDED TO THOSE PROPERTIES THAT MIGHT BE DIFFERENTIATEED FROM THE NEW REGULATION REGARDLESS OF THAT OWNERSHIP. SO IT IS -- IT IS -- I CAN'T SPEAK TO CASE LAW BUT I CAN SPEAK TO THAT'S JUST KIND OF HOW ZONING WORKS. BY WAY OF EXAMPLE, IF YOU HAD A HOME THAT DIDN'T MEET SIDE YARD SET BACK BECAUSE IT WAS BUILT PRIOR TO ESTABLISHMENT OF THAT SET BACK. ESTABLISHING THAT SET BACK DOESN'T MAKE IT SO YOU HAVE TO THEN CHOP OFF TWO FEET OF YOUR HOME. LIKEWISE, THE SALE OF THAT HOME DOESN'T NECESSITATE THAT SAME ACTION THAT NON-CONFORMING STATUS CONTINUES. IF YOU REMOVED THAT YOU DON'T GET TO PUT IT BACK. THAT WOULD HAPPEN WHETHER IT HAPPENS UNDER CURRENT OWNER OR ANY FUTURE OWNER. SO I GUESS THAT IS NEAR A ANSWER REGARDING THE LEGAL STATUS FOR MORE THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE BEST TO COME FROM CITY ATTORNEY OFFICE BUT IT IS CLEARLY WIDE PRACTICE NOT UNIQUE TO THIS CIRCUMSTANCE.
00:32:58.263: >> THANKS, THAT HELPS. I GUESS MY OTHER QUESTION IS MORE CLARIFICATION TO CLARIFY THE PLANNING COMMISSION ROLE IN THIS ISSUE. I WANT TO MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY THAT YOU ARE TASKED BY CITY COUNCIL TO BASICALLY DRAFT LANGUAGE THAT WOULD MEET THIS DESIRE FOR THE NON-CONFORMING USE.
00:33:22.721: >> YEAH. THE DIRECTION FROM CITY COUIL IS PRETTY SPECIFIC. IF WE WANTED TO -- IT IS TO RECOMMEND ORDINANCE CHANGES THAT WOULD HAVE THE AFFECT OF NON-PRINCIPLE RESIDENTS SHORT TERM RENTALS BEING A PROSPECTIVE REGULATION. I THINK I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE SPONSOR AND THE COUNCIL WHO ENACTED THAT, HOWEVER, I THINK THAT INTENT COMES FROM THIS HAS BEEN AN EMERGENT INDUSTRY AND PRACTICE IN THE CITY THAT IS PROEVER HAPPENED PROBABLY QUICKER PACE THAN REGULATORY FRAMEWORK HAPPENED AROUND IT. SO RECOGNIZING THAT AND PROVIDING SOME SPACE FOR THAT'S PROPERTIES THAT MAY HAVE STARTED IT OPERATED THOSE WHICH ARE NOW CONTRARY TO THAT CHAPTER 97 TO HAVE BIT OF PROTECTION OR TRANSITION LONG TERM BASIS.
00:34:20.746: >> THANK YOU.
00:34:21.913: >> DOES THAT HELP?
00:34:22.814: >> YEP. THANKS.
00:34:24.716: >> COMMISSIONER DISCHOU ALSO HAD YOUR HAND UP. SOME COMMUCATION WE GOT, THIS USE IS A LITTLEARD FOR PEOPLE TO WRAP THEIR HEADS AROUN SO T LANGUAGE AS I READ IT, AND JUSTANT TO ASK YOU I'LL KNOW WHAT IETTING WRONG. ME THE NGUAGE IS I READ THE ORNANCE SAYSHAT T CITS PROPERTI UNDER -- WHO --HAT CONDIONS, ASEGALUNDER SOM NON-CONFORNG USES. SEEMS TO ME THE WEIGHT OF THE LANGUAGE OF THE ORDINANCE IS IN THE ESTABLISH. WHAT EXACTLY IS THE CITY GOING TO LOOK AT TO DECIDE THAT SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN USED IN A WAY THAT WE ARE NOW SAYING IS NO LONGER LEGAL, WE WOULD ALLOW THEM TO BE A LEGAL NON-CONFORMING USE. WHAT WOULD THEY HAVE HAD TO HAVE DONE IN ORDER TO BE -- IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH THEMSELVES IN THAT WAY?
00:35:31.483: >> SURE. YOU SEE THE UDC ISN'T OVERLY PRESCRIPTIVE IN THAT. BUT I WILL TELL YOU HOW WE ENVISION DOING IT. ONE ANY PROPERTYNA MEETS THAT CONDITION
00:35:45.130: >> A NON-PRINCIPLE RESIDENCE SHOULD BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE CITY RENTAL HOUSING PROGRAM. SO THAT MEANS, ANY RENTAL OF ANY PROPERTY REQUIRES CERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE WITH HOUSING RENTAL SO THAT'S ONE ASPECT OF PROPERTY WE MEASURE TO SEE IF IT WAS OPERATING IN THAT MANNER PRIOR TO MARS 1. THE OTHER ASPECT OF THAT WOULD BE SOME METHOD IN WHICH WE COULD DETERMINE THAT IT WAS BEING OPERATED AS A SHORT TERM RENTAL. THAT COULD BE THROUGH PERHAPS EVIDENCE OF A LEASING CONTRACT, PERHAPS A LISTING CONTRACT THROUGH SHORT TERM RENTAL SERVICE, THERE ARE NUMEROUS SERVICES, I THINK FROM A CITY STAFF PERSPECTIVE THOSE WILL THE SORT OF WAYS THAT WE ENVISION MEASURING THAT AND MAKING A DETERMINATION JUST LIKE WE WOULD IN ANY NON-CONFORMING STATUS. THERE MIGHT BE OTHER PIECES OF EVIDENCE THAT I CAN'T PREDICT THAT WOULD SATISFY THAT. AT A MINIMUM SOME PROOF THAT IT WAS OPERATING AS SHORT TERM RENTAL PRIOR TO THAT DATE AND IT WAS COMPLIANT WITH THE CITY RENTAL COMPLIANCE PROGRAM THAT IT WAS A CERTIFIED RENTAL PROPERTY.
00:37:05.210: >> CERTIFIED RENTAL PROPERTY DO YOU HAVE TO BE INSPECTED?
00:37:08.480: >> YES. YOU HAVE TO BE INSPECTED. YOU HAVE TO MEET BASIC PROPERTY MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENT AND INSPECTION HAPPENS ON A REGULAR BASIS, CURRENTLY AROUND A 30 MONTH WINDOW YOU CAN POTENTIALLY GET A LONGER REINSPECTION PERIOD IF YOU SATISFY ALL THE REQUIREMENTS UPON INITIAL INSPECTION. BUT YES, IT IS A ROUTINE INSPECTION OF THE PROPERTY THAT IT MEETS BASIC HEALTH AND SAFETY REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE PROPERTY NEEDS CODE.
00:37:40.345: >> THAT MAKES GREAT SENSE. I HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION THAT TAKE US TO THE OTHER END OF THIS WHOLE PROCESS SORT OF. AND THAT IS THAT I UNDERSTAND FROM CHAPTER -- IS IT 97? I UNDERSTAND FROM CHAPTER 97 THAT THE CITY -- THAT YOU COULD LOSE YOUR LICENSE FOR OPERATING AN STR, ANYONE COULD IN ANY DISTRICT WHETHER YOU ARE LEGALLY NON-CONFORMING OR WHATEVER. YOU COULD LOSE YOUR LICENSE IF YOU WERE DETERMINED -- IF IT WERE DETERMINED YOUR STR BECAME A PUBLIC NUISANCE.
00:38:18.917: >> THAT'S CORRECT.
00:38:19.751: >> I WONDER WHAT KIND OF EVIDENCE, I KNOW YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION, IT'S NOT LAID OUT IN THE UDC BUT WHAT KIND OF EVIDENCE DO YOU IMAGINE OR ENVISION OR IS THERE SOME ESTABLISHED PRACTICE THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED TO DETERMINE AN STR HAS BECOME A PUBLIC NUISANCE?
00:38:38.703: >> YEAH. AGAIN I WOULDN'T WANT TO BE PRESCRIPTIVE BUT IT WOULD PROBABLY BE THINGS LIKE COMMUNITY STANDARDS ORDINANCE ENFORCEMENT CALLS, NOISE LITTER CALLS, IF THERE WERE HOUSING ISSUES THAT IS THAT THERE WAS CONCERNS THAT THE HOUSE WAS BEING -- WAS OVEROCCUPIED BASED ON THE CODE OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENTS OF THAT. IF THEY WEREN'T ROUTINELY IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE RENTAL INSPECTION PROGRAM GENERALLY. THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF THINGS THAT I THINK IF THEY WERE STACKED UP OR HAPPENING WITH SOME FREQUENCY WOULD PROBABLY AT LEAST START THE CITY PROCESS TO CONSIDER REVOCATION OR NON--- AT LEAST NON-RENEWAL OF THAT LICENSE FOR THAT PARTICULAR LOCATION AT THAT TIME.
00:39:27.719: >> THEN ONE TINY FINAL QUESTION. SAY I'M OPERATING ONE OF THESE. I DO EVERYTHING WRONG AND I LOSE MY LICENSE. SO I SELL. I SELL MY STR. IT IS ONLY ME WHO GETS MY LICENSE REVOKED IF I SELL TO SOMEONE ELSE, THE ABILITY TO BE -- IF I WAS A NON-CONFORMING USE. SORRY. THAT WAS KEY. THE ABILITY TO REMAIN LEGAL NON-CONFORMING USE STAYS WITH THAT PROPERTY EVEN IF I SCREWED UP. CORRECT? I LOST MY LICENSE DOESN'T MEAN THE PROPERTY IS DISQUALIFIED.
00:40:06.358: >> YES, THAT'S CORRECT.
00:40:11.429: >> RIGHT. COMMISSIONER, I SEE YOUR HAND UP AND I WANT TO SAY TO PEOPLE THIS BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A PETITIONER I THINK WE GOT A LITTLE OUT OF SEQUENCE. I'M ALSO GOING TO PUT MR. LENART ON THE BOAT, HE SAID I CAN TAKE QUESTIONS NOW OR AFTER PUBLIC COMMENT, BUT TYPICALLY WE HAVE PUBLIC COMMENT FIRST AND THEN WE HAVE OUR DISCUSSION. IF THERE ARE POINTS OF CLARIFICATION THOUGH AND I THINK SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE ASKED ARE REALLY HELPFUL FOR, IT'S NOT A COMMENT, AS MUCH AS A POINT OF CLARIFICATION. MAYBE HELPFUL FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO MAKE PUBLIC COMMENT SO IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION NOW OF CLARIFICATION, GO AHEAD AND WE CAN TAKE THOSE BEFORE OPENING THE PUBLIC COMMENT BUT ALSO FOR THE CALLERS ON THE LINE WE HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN THAT. IT MAKES SENSE TO SINCE WE HAD ONE PRESENTER HERE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE GETTING THE FULL STORY BEFORE WE OPEN UP FOR PUBLIC COMMENT. COMMISSIONER CLARKE YOU GOT A QUESTION?
00:41:11.322: >> IS IT POINT OF CLARIFICATION, IN THE FUTURE IMPACT ABILITY FOR LIKE, TRANSITIONAL HOUSING OR SOMETHING LIKE SHELTER OR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SHELTERS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, WOULD THEY BE ABLE TO OPERATE OR WITH THIS KIND OF PREVENT ANYTHING LIKE THAT FROM OPENING NEIGHBORHOODS?
00:41:31.843: >> YEAH. THOSE TYPICALLY HAVE DIFFERENT USE DEFINITIONS IN OUR ORDINANCE SO I DON'T THINK THIS WILL BE TO THOSE AT ALL.
00:41:43.121: >> ANY OTHER PINTS OF CLARIFICATION? COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN, AND COMMISSIONER -- EVERYBODY HAS POINTS OF CLARIFICATION TONIGHT. YOU CAN ALSO ASK QUESTIONS LATER TOO DURING OUR DISCUSSION. BUT GO AHEAD COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN.
00:41:56.401: >> MR. LENART. WHY MARCH 1ST? FOR THE GRANDFATHERING? WHY THAT DATE, WHY NOT SOME OTHER DATE?
00:42:06.478: >> WE THROUGH A DART AT A CALENDAR. NO. CHAPTER 97 WAS ADOPTED IN SEPTEMBER, BUT I HAD AN EFFECTIVE DATE OF MARCH 1ST 2021. SO USES BEING ESTABLISHED BEFORE THAT EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE CHAPTER 97 THAT IS WHERE THAT DATE CAME IN.
00:42:33.905: >> EXCELLENT POINT OF CLARIFICATION. COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT, WAS THAT YOUR QUESTION TOO?
00:42:39.077: >> IT WAS ONE OF MY QUESTIONS. I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS AND I WILL TRY TO BE FAST. WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY THIS APPLIES TO IN THE CITY. SO SAY THIS ALL GETS APPROVED AND WE SAY THIS IS FINE WILL THERE BE A PROCESS ESTABLISHED BY WHICH PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO PRESENT THEIR EVIDENCE THAT THEY WERE OPERATING IN STR BY MARCH -- BEFORE MARCH 1, I ASSUME THERE'S GOING TO BE A WIDE NET CAST LIKE WILL THE CITY BE TRYING TO IDENTIFY PROPERTIES AT THE SAME TIME PEOPLE CAN COME TO THE CITY?
00:43:12.143: >> WITH WE HAVE ALREADY STARTED THAT PROCESS WITH THE FIRST WAVE OF SERIES OF TARGETED EMAILS AND NOTICES AND POST CARDS TO PROPERTIES THAT ARE IN OUR RENTAL CERTIFICATION PROGRAM. AND WE ANTICIPATE PROBABLY SOME ADDITIONAL CORRESPONDENCE IN THE SAME REGARD AND WE ALSO HAVE WEBSITE UP TO EXPLAIN THIS AND PROVIDE EARLY OPPORTUNITY FOR INDIVIDUALS TO START SOME OF THAT INFORMATION AS WELL.
00:43:45.410: >> IS THERE A DATE THIS EXPIRES, LIKE IF SOMEBODY COMES TO US IN A YEAR? THEY ARE LIKE WAIT WAIT WAIT, I FORGOT, MAYBE SIX MONTHS DO WE SAY THIS HAS TO BE IN PLACE BY X?
00:43:56.087: >> CURRENTLY WE ARE ASKING FOR THAT INFORMATION TO BE SUBMITTED BY MARCH 31ST. BUT I THINK THAT IS AN ADMINISTRATIVE TARGET, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT IS EVOLVED BUT THAT WHERE WE ARE STARTING.
00:44:12.337: >> ONE FINAL THING FOR NOW, I WANT TO MAKE SURE TO UNDERSTAND THIS DISCONTINUATION OF USE. SO YOU HAVE AN NON-CONFORMING PROPERTY SO OPERATING FULL FULL TIME AS SHORT TERM RENTAL. THEY CAN SELL TO ANOTHER INVESTOR AND THEY CAN CONTINUE OPERATING IT AS A SHORT TERM RENTAL AND THAT COULD JUST CONTINUE TO HAPPEN AND THEN YOU -- WITH PROPERTY SO I FINALLY I THINK I UNDERSTAND. THAT IF YOU SELL IT TO SOMEONE THAT INTENDS TO LIVE THERE, AS THE OWNER THEY WOULD STILL BE ABLE TO OPERATE OR SIX MONTHS OR LESS OF THE YEAR SHORT TERM RENTAL. THEIR PROPERTY. IS THAT A USE CONTINUATION OR WOULD THEY STILL HAVE THAT OPTION AS THE HOMEOWNER OCCUPANT IN THE FUTURE, AND CR THE PROPERTY FULL TIME?
00:45:01.352: >> I COULD MANIFEST IN DIFFERENT WAY BUS THE WAY YOU DESCRIBED IT WOULD BE A CHANGE IN USE. THEY WOULD BE CHANGING BETWEEN DEFINED SHORT TERM RENTAL DEFINITIONS FROM A NON-PRINCIPLE RESIDENCE TO A PRINCIPLE RESIDENCE SO THAT WOULD BE A CHANGE IN USE. AFTER A PERIOD PERIOD OF TIME, THEY COULD UNDER THAT SCENARIO OPERATE AS A PRINCIPLE RESIDENCE HOME STAY OR WHOLE HOUSE SHORT TERM RENTAL. ONCE THAT OCCURS FOR PERIOD OF A YEAR OR MORE THAN THE NON-PRINCIPLE RESIDENCE NON-CONFORMING USE WOULD BE LAPSED. GONE. UNDERSTOOD, LAST PART OF THE THING WHAT YOU SAID.
00:45:43.995: >> LET ME TRY IT AGAIN. IF YOU ARE A -- YOU ARE A COMPANY AND YOU OWN THE PROPERTY YOU DON'T LIVE THERE AND YOU ARE OPERATING A SHORT TERM RENTAL AND THIS ORDINANCE IS ENACTED AND U YOU HAVE LEGAL STATUS COMMISSIONER GIBB RANDAL PURCHASE IT IS HOUSE, MOVES THERE, CONTINUES TO OPERATE AS SHORT TERM RENTAL HOWEVER UNDER THE DEFINITION OF SHORT TERM RENTAL, HOME STAY OR WHOLE HOUSE WHICH IS DIFFERENT SHORT TERM REASON IT WILLS AS DEFINED BY THE UDC, ONCE COMMISSIONER GIBB RANDAL OPERATED THAT IN THAT MANNER FOR OVER A YEAR, THE LEGAL NON-CONFORMING STATUS OF A NON-RESIDENTIAL SHORT TERM RENTAL IS NO LONGER APPLICABLE TO THAT PROPERTY AND CAN'T BE RE-ESTABLISHED AT THAT PROPERTY.
00:46:27.905: >> OKAY. THAT MAKES SENSE, THANK YOU SO MUCH. BUT IF COMMISSIONER GIBB RANDAL SOLDHE HOUSE TO ANOTHER COMPANY, IT'S STILL WLD HAVE THAT USE ATTACHED.
00:46:36.781: >> THEY COULD NOT DO A NON-PRINCIPAL RESIDENCE, THAT LEASE WOULD HAVE BEEN LOST AT THAT POINT.
00:46:44.322: >> IF SHE OWN IT LESS THAN A YEAR.
00:46:47.025: >> THAS CORRECT. SORRY.
00:46:50.328: >> OKAY. THANK YOU.
00:46:54.866: >> ANYTHER POINTS OF CLARIFICATION BEFORE WE OPEN TH PUBLIC HEARI?
00:46:59.070: >> SOR TO PUT YOU  REAL ESTATECOMMISSIONER GB RAND.
00:47:02.306: >> ALL RIGHT TH I WILL OPEN T PUBLIC ARING, THIS  AN OPPORTUNI FOR PERSONS  SPE UP TOHREE MINUTEABOUT THE PROPOD DEVELOPMENCODE REGARDI SHORT TERMENTALS. PUBL COMMENTAN BE MADE BY CAING (877)853-47 AND THEN ENRI MTING ID 92916202435. CITY STAFF WILL CALL ON CALLERS THAT HAVE RAISED THEIR HAND, YOU DO THAT BY PRESSING STAR 9 YOU WILL HEAR THE LAST THREE DIGITS OF YOUR TELEPHONE NUMBER, MR. LENART WILL CALL THAT WAY. YOU WILL HEAR AN AUTOMATED ANNOUNCEMENT SAYING THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO SPEAK. PLEASE MOVE TO A QUIET AREA AND MUTE ANY BACKGROUND SOUNDS SO THAT WE CAN HEAR YOU CLEARLY AND PLEASE ALSO STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS AT THE BEGINNING OF YOUR COMMENTS. AND AGAIN WE HAVE GOT QUITE A LINEUP ON THE PHONE SO PLEASE DO KEEP YOUR COMMENTS TO THREE MINUTES OR LESS. THANK YOU, VERY MUCH.
00:48:02.533: >> JUST WANT TO SAY ONE MORE TIME THIS IS JUST ABOUT THE SHORT TERM RENTALS IF YOU ARE ON THE CALL AND INTERESTED IN TALKING ABOUT ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS THERE WILL BE A SECOND -- SEPARATE PUBLIC HEARING FOR THAT. SO THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT ADUs IN A BIT.
00:48:19.784: >> PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 556, THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
00:48:25.089: >> THIS IS RALPH MCKEY 1116 RED OAK. CAN YOU HEAR OKAY IN
00:48:29.427: >> WE CAN.
00:48:31.596: >> THERE IS A LOT HERE THAT IS FAIRLY COMPLICATED LEGAL ISSUES WHICH YOU HAVE HAVE BEEN ASKING GOOD QUESTIONS ABOUT. I WILL OBVIOUSLY CAN'T GET THROUGH EVEN ONE-TENTH OF WHAT'S THERE IN THREE MINUTES BUT WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO IS CONCENTRATE ON A COUPLE OF THINGS. THE FIRST ONE IS I'M REALLY STRUGGLING WITH THIS ISSUE OF THE NORMAL WHAT MR. LENART DESCRIBES I BELIEVE AS THE CORRECT ANALYSIS FOR A LEGAL HOW IT'S TREATED IN ZONING. THAT IS NOT WHAT COUNCIL SENT THIS TO YOU TO DO. AT LEAST AS I REMEMBER THAT MEETING. THE COUNCIL IN THE DEBATE AT THAT MEETING, IT WAS VERY CLEAR THAT ONE OF THE ISSUES WAS HOW MANY OF THESE STRs, EVERYONE OF THESE STRs IS ONE LESS LONG TERM RENTAL OR PROPERTY THAT COULD BE IN THE SALE MARKET AND THE PROPONENTS OF GRANDFATHERING IN SAID MANY TIMES WELL THERE'S NOT THAT MANY OF THEM AND THEY WILL DIMINISH OVER TIME BECAUSE USE WILL NOT GO WITH THE PROPERTY. THAT WAS AN ELEMENT VOTED ON WITH THAT UNDERSTANDING. SO I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY IT IS BEING PUT A AS THE NORMAL COMMON LAW WAY WHEN THAT WASN'T THE UNDERSTANDING OF PEOPLE WHO VOTED ON THAT RESOLUTION. I'M PRETTY SURE I'M CORRECT AT THAT. SO I WOULD REALLY WANT TO HAVE THAT REVISITED IN A CAREFUL WAY. AND THE -- AND THAT GOES TO NEXT POINT WITH IS I HAVE A CONCERN THAT HAVING WHAT IS NORMAL UNDER THE COMMON LAW PUT IN THE UDC IN THIS WAY WILL MAYBE CAUSE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OR BE DIFFICULT. AND FOR EXAMPLE, I LIKE THE CONCEPT OF FINDING OUT HOW MANY THERE ARE AND ASKING PEOPLE TO POW TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE NOW AND IT IS A GREAT IDEA. THAT WILL TELL US HOW MANY THERE ARE. SO ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK THAT LEADS TO IS YOU SHOULD TAKE NO ACTION UNTIL YOU GET THAT DATA BECAUSE THIS MIGHT MAKE SENSE IF THERE IS A HUNDRED LIKE THE PROMONTES SAY, IF YOU GET 500 APPLICATIONS, THAT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT KETTLE OF FISH. MAKING A DECISION ANY DECISION --
00:50:59.810: >> THREE SECONDS.
00:51:01.012: >> BEFORE YOU NEE THAT IS NOT PROPER. SO THE I HAVE ONE OTHER POINT IN THIS FEW SECONDS THAT I'M CURIOUS WHY THE EMPHASIS ON THEIR SUPPOSEDLY HAVE BEEN LEGAL ALL ALONG. I REALLY THINK THAT IS NOT CORRECT AND INCONSISTENT WITH WHAT MR. DELLA COURT SAID AT THE BEGINNING A YEAR AGO. I THINK THAT COMPLY CASE THINGS, BUT THAT NEEDS TO BE CONSIDERED. THESE MAY BE ILLEGAL RIGHT NOW. UNDER OUR CURRENT ORDINANCE BEFORE THE 97 CHAPTER 97 WAS PUT IN THE. MAKES IT A WHOLE DIFFERENT BALL GAME. SO ANYWAY --
00:51:39.950: >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
00:51:41.152: >> THAT'S THE WAY IT IS. BIOBUY.
00:51:43.054: >> THANK YOU. OPERATOR:  CALLER WITH PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 773. CALLER WITH PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 773. UNMUTE YOUR PHONE AND ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION.

00:52:15.519: >> WE CAN. GO AHEAD.
00:52:16.921: >> THIS IS KATE 1519 ANDERSON AVENUE, IT SOUNDS LIKE BASED ON THE DIRECTION THAT YOU WERE GIVEN THIS LIKE MEETS THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE DIRECTION YOU WERE GIVEN AND SOUNDS LIKE MY CONCERN IS MORE WITH THE DIRECTION GIVEN. I DEFINITELY HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT AS A PREVIOUS CALLER ALLUDED HOW MANY UNITS DOES THIS EFFECT WHAT AGAINST OUR ORIGINAL PLAN WITH THIS ORDINANCE WAS. BUT AGAIN IT SOUNDS LIKE WITHIN NARROW CONFINES OF WHAT YOU GUYS WERE ASKED TO DO, THIS LANGUAGE DOES SEEM TO FIT THE BILL. FOR THAT. DEFINITELY THE CONCERNS ABOUT LOTS OF SHORT TERM UNITS ON THE MARKET AND DISPLACING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR LONG TERM BUT THAT'S IT FOR ME. THANKS.
00:53:08.906: >> THANK YOU.
00:53:20.184: >> CALLER WITH PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 326. CALLER WITH PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 326 YOU CAN UNMUTE WITH STAR 6 AND ADDRESS PLANNING COMMISSION.
00:53:33.597: >> HELLO. MY NAME IS JEFF CROCKETT CAN YOU HEAR ME?
00:53:38.369: >> WE CAN.
00:53:39.637: >> YOU MIGHT WANT TO MUTE THE SOUND BEHIND YOU BECAUSE WE CAN HEAR SOME FEEDBACK.
00:53:48.245: >> I WILL MOVE TO ANOTHER ROOM. SO BASICALLY MY CONCERN ABOUT THIS ORDINANCE IS ENFORCEMENT. I WAS INVOLVED A LOT IN THE SIGN ORDINANCE REVISION AND I LEARNED FROM THAT THAT THE WHOLE NOTION OF TEMPORARY SIGNS WHICH RELIES ON TIME, DEADLINES IS PRETTY MUCH UNENFORCEABLE BECAUSE THE STAFF IS NOT AVAILABLE TO RESPOND TO COMPLAINTS. SO WHAT'S MISSING FROM THIS ORDINANCE IS A STATEMENT ON HOW MUCH ENFORCEMENT TIME IS GOING TO BE NEEDED. IT'S SORT OF UNREALISTIC TO EXPECT, THIS IS GOING TO BE TRUE WHEN WE TALK ADU IF YOU ADD ORDINANCES THAT REQUIRE -- THAT ARE COMPLICATED LIKE THIS ONE IS, AND REQUIRES A LOT OF TIME, IT IS GOING TO REQUIRE SOMEONE TO EVALUATE WHETHER THE ORDINANCE IS OUT OF COMPLIANCE. TYPICALLY WHAT HAPPENS IS ORDINANCE REVISION HOWEVER, IS DONE BY NEIGHBORS. NEIGHBORS WHO REPORT POSSIBLE INFRACTIONS AND THERE HAS TO BE A PROCESS MANY PLACE FOR HANDLING THOSE COMPLAINTS AND REPORTING BACK TO THE PERSON WHO MADE THE COMPLAINT TO DETERMINE THAT THE COMPLAINT HAS BEEN ADDRESSED. I SEE NOTHING INVOLVED IN THIS ORDINANCE THAT TALKS ENFORCEMENT. SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO POSTPONE THIS CONSIDERATION UNTIL MR. LENART HAS A CHANCE TO ASSESS HOW MUCH STAMP TIME IS NEED TOAD EFFECTIVELY ENFORCE THIS ORDINANCE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. STAFF TIME.
00:55:35.619: >> THANK YOU.
00:55:40.057: >>
00:55:49.233: >> CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 632. CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 632. UNMOO IT YOUR PHONE, YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
00:56:04.949: >> HI, EVERYONE, MY NAME IS -- I LIVE AT 407 NORTH ASHLEY. I JUST WANT TO SPEAK AGAINSTS TO THIS ORDINANCE THAT WOULD WEAKEN IT. WE HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND WHY THIS ORDINANCE IS PUT IN PLACE IN THE FIRST PLACE. WHICH IS BECAUSE HOUSING AFFORDABILITY IN ANN ARBOR IS A IN A CRISIS MODE. I'M SECRETARY OF GEO GRADUATE STUDENTS UNION AND THE WAY OUR SALARY CURRENTLY IS BY UNIVERSITY IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR MEMBERS TO FORWARD ONE BEDROOM APARTMENTS IN THIS CITY. WHICH COSTS UPWARDS OF 50% OF OUR SALARIES RIGHT NOW. IF YOU WANT A CITY WHERE THE PEOPLE WHO WORK AT THE UNIVERSITY WHO AREN'T -- WHO CAN'T AFFORD TO BE HOMEOWNERS CAN HAVE A CHANCE OF LIVE ORGANIZE PEOPLE WORK IN ANY PROFESSION AT ALL, THAT MEET MINIMUM WAGE OR MAKE LESS THAN THE MEDIAN INCOME, IN THIS TOWN, REALLY NEED TO FIGHT FOR EVERY POSSIBLE RENTAL. HAVING A COST TO DO ORDINANCE THAT GRANDFATHERS IN PRE-EXISTING AIR B AND Bs AND SHORT TERM RENTALS IS -- ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MANY THERE ARE RIGHT NOW, IS JUST REALLY UNCONSCIONABLE GIVEN HOW BAD THE RENTAL SITUATION IN THIS TOWN IS. PLEASE, PLEASE STAND UP FOR RENTERS. WE NEED YOUR HELP, HERE THE GOVERNMENT, WE NEED YOU TO DO YOUR JOB AND BRING DOWN THE RENTAL COSTS IN THIS TOWN. THANKS.
00:57:35.139: >> THANK YOU.
00:57:42.613: >>
00:57:45.516: >> CALLER WITH PHONE NUMBER ENDING 070. CALLER WITH PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 070. YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
00:57:55.526: >> CAN YOU HEAR ME?
00:57:58.295: >> WE CAN.
00:58:01.732: >> MY NAME IS SHREVE, I'M A RESIDENT REASON TORR AT 2232 PITTSFIELD BOULEVARD. FIRST THANKS TO ALL COMMISSIONERS AND MR. LENART FOR GOING THROUGH ALL THIS. I KNOW IT'S COMPLICATED. AND IT'S BEEN VERY INFORMATIVE. I DO WANT TO ECHO THE SENTIMENT FROM THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER AND EARLIER ONES AS WELL, AN'T THE CONCERNS THAT I HAVE WITH THE RESIDENTIAL SOLUTION THIS PAST DECEMBER IN THIS PLAN IN DECEMBER TO LEGACY IN OR GRANDFATHER IN PRE-ESTING OR ALREADY EXISTING STRs. THERE'S A COUPLE OF ISSUES THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER MENTIONED WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF A HOUSING CRISIS, WE NEED EVERY UNIT WE CAN GET AND THAT IS A KEY GOAL FOR THE ORDINANCE THAT WAS PASSED BACK IN SEPTEMBER. SO I THINK THIS KIND OF FALLS I DIRECT CONTRADICTION WITH THAT MEMBERS OUGHT THIS UP, THATYNCIL ALLOWING THE INVESTO TO B ANDFATHERED IN IN OR LEGACIED IN, YOU A GING THEM A REALLY UNFAIR ADVANTA IN COMPARIN TO THE OTHER IESTORS IN THE AND SENTIALLY CREATIN A MONOLY WHERE THECANAINTAIN THES STRs I IN RESIDENTIAL FORMED AND ESPECIAY WITH THE ISSUE AT IUESS WE DON'T HAVE CLARIFICATIOON RIGHT NOW. THAT WOULD MAKE THAT ESSENTIALLY PERMANENT. EVEN AFTER AN STR RESIDENCE IS SOLD SO THERE'S A COUPLE OF ISSUES THERE, I THIS I IT IS A REALLY DIFFICULT THING TO RECON WITH BECAUSE WE HAVE THE NEWLY ELECTED COUNCIL MEMBERS FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS THE MAIN DEBATE HAS BEEN AROUND BUILDING HOUSING AND WE HAVE HAD THIS DEVELOPMENT VERSUS ANTI-DEVELOPMENT FACTION FIGHTING. AND I SEE LIKE THIS IS A REAL OPPORTUNITY TO BRIDGE THAT GAP FOR ONCE. WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO BRING IN MORE UNITS AND INCREASE THE HOUSING STOCK. AND I THINK EVERYONE CAN AGREE THAT WE DON'T LOVE NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE WITH POTENTIALLY HAVE HOTELS OPERATING FULL TIME WITH THESE AIR B AND Bs.
01:00:28.212: >> 30 SECOND.
01:00:29.413: >> IMPORTANT TO MAINTAIN VIBRANT OF THE COMMUNITIES. BUT THE FINAL ISSUE THAT I HAVE WAS ALREADY BROUGHT UP IS RIGHT NOW THE CITY CURRENTLY COLLECTING DATA ON THIS. THEY ARE CURRENTLY RECEIVING APPLICATIONS FROM THE INVESTORS THAT THIS WOULD BE AFFECTED BY REGISTERING 30 MINUTES FOR THIS. SO FROM NOW TO END OF THE MONTH 31ST, WE WILL BE GETTING THAT DATA SO I DON'T KNOW WHY WE WOULD MAKE A DECISION ON IT BEFORE WE ACTUALLY GET THE NUMBERS. AND THERE'S NO RUSH IN DECIDING THAT. NO ONE IS BEING PUNISHED RIGHT NOW, NOT BEING ENFORCED. THERE'S NO TIME THE COUNCIL GAVE. THANK YOU.
01:01:05.549: >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
01:01:15.659: >> CALLER WITH PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 820. CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 820. YOU CAN UNMUTE YOUR PHONE AND ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION FOR THREE MINUTES.
01:01:27.971: >> HI CAN FOLKS HEAR ME?
01:01:29.706: >> WE CAN.
01:01:31.275: >> I'M VICTORIA, I LIVE AT 810 HENRY STREET. I JUST WANT TO CONTINUE TO ECHO THE CONCERNS OF PREVIOUS CALLERS ABOUT WEAKENING THE ORDINANCE THAT WAS PASSED BY GRANDFATHERING IN, AN UNTOLD NUMBER OF HOUSING STOCK MAKING IT -- MAKING IT SO THAT WE MORE OR LESS PERMANENTLY HAVE UNDERREGULATED HOTELS AND RESIDENTIAL COMMUNITIES. I SPECIFICALLY WANT TO ADDRESS THIS IMPETUS FOR HAVING A QUOTE TRANSITION PERIOD FOR PEOPLE WHO FOLLOW OR INVESTORS WHO HAVE BEEN USING HOUSING AS SHORT TERM RENTALS. ESPECIALLY THE WORD TRANSITION WHICH IMPLIES A CHANGE OF STATE. AND WHAT WE ARE REALLY TALKING ABOUT HERE IS MAKING SHORT TERM HOUSING UNITS A PERMANENT FIXTURE AND RESIDENTIAL COMMUNITIES, AND I JUST WANT IT TO BE CLEAR WHEN TALKING HARD TO INVESTORS THAT INVESTMENTS DON'T COME WITH ANY GUARANTEES AND THIS ORDINANCE DOESN'T COME WITH REMOVING HOUSING OR HOUSING FROM PROPERTY OWNERS OR FINES OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. YOU GET TO KEEP YOUR HOUSE, YOU JUST DON'T KEEP TO OPERATE A MINUTETURE HOTEL AND A RESIDENTIAL AREA. I JUST WANT TO -- YEAH. I JUST WANT TO ECHO THE CONCERNS THAT WE NOT MAKE ANY DECISIONS HERE BEFORE WE EVEN KNOW THE NUMBER OF UNITS THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HERE. BECAUSE AS OF RIGHT NOW WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IS EFFECTIVELY TAKING OUT AN UNTOLD NUMBER OF HOUSING FROM THE SUPPLY AND A CITY WHERE WE ARE ALREADY EXPERIENCING A HOUSING AFFORDABLEIBILITY CRISIS. ALSO BY ALLOWING THE SHORT TERM RENTALS TO CONTINUE IN RES TNIAL COMMUNITIES WE ARE LOSING THE DEVELOP TO DEVELOP DEEPLY ROOTED COMMUNITY TIES. WHEN IT'S JUST FILLED WITH FOLKS WHO ARE COMING IN AND OUT FOR ONLY A COUPLE OF DAYS AT A TIME. WHICH IS UNFORTUNATE. WHEN THINKING ABOUT THE CHARACTER OF THIS CITY. WITH THAT, THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY, THANK YOU.
01:04:06.063: >> THANK YOU.
01:04:17.774: >> MR. STILLBURG YOU CAN UNMUTE YOUR PHONE AND YOU HAVE UP TO THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
01:04:25.715: >> THANK YOU. THE POINTS THAT I WANTED TO MAKE HAVE BEEN MADE SO I'M GOING TO ECHO THEM AND TRY TO BE BRIEF. I DO THINK THAT BY PUT THIS MANY THE UDC COULD BE CREATING SOME UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AND IT WAS PROBABLY BETTER LEFT OUT OF THE UDC IF THAT WAS AT ALL POSSIBLE. MAYBE THE FACT THAT IF IT WASN'T POSSIBLE THAT KIND OF POINTS TO ANOTHER POTENTIAL PROBLEM. WITH THE WHOLE CONCEPT. WE DO HAVE A DUE DATE FOR REGISTRATION, IT'S A MONTH AWAY. SO WE SHOULD GET THE DATA. THE NUMBER AND LOCATION OF ALL THESE UNITS. YOU CAN MAKE BETTER DECISIONS WHEN WE MAKE DECISION BASED ON DATA SO WE SHOULD BE MAKING DECISIONS AFTER WE HAVE COLLECTED THE DATA. WE SHOULD MAKE THAT DATA PUBLIC. WE ARE ALSO CREATING A BUSINESS ADVANTAGE IN PERPETUITY. THAT -- WHEN WE DO THAT THAT IS A VALUABLE THING. THAT MAKES IT MORE LIKELY THAT THE BUSINESS WOULD CONTINUE TO OPERATE LONGER. BECAUSE THERE'S SUCH A VALUE IN THAT. AND AGAIN THAT WAS NOT -- DID NOT APPEAR TO BE WHAT COUNCIL ORIGINAL STATEMENT WERE INDICATING THAT THEY WERE DESIROUS OF SO THAT SHOULD BE LOOKED AT AGAIN. THANK YOU.
01:05:46.563: >> THANK YOU.
01:05:54.070: >> CALLER WITH PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 693. CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 693. YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
01:06:05.382: >> HELLO. MY NAME IS WENDY CARMEN. I LIVE AT 2340 GEORGETOWN, I SPENT A NUMBER OF YEARS ON A ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS AND I AM CURRENTLY THE PRESIDENT OF THE ORCHARD HILLS MAPLE WOOD HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION. SO CITIZENS BROUGHTOR BROUGHT SIGNIFICANT PLAINTS TO COUNCIL ASKING FOR HELP IN COMBATING INCREASING PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE GROWING STR BUSINESSES IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS. AND AFTER FUNDING A STUDY IN 2019 COUNCIL SUBSEQUENTLY PASSED THIS ORDINANCE LAST SEPTEMBER KNOWING AT THE TIME THEY PASSED IT THAT A GROUP OF PEOPLE OF UNKNOWN SIZE NOT INTENDING TO BE RESIDENTS HAD ALREADY INVESTED MONEY INTO THE STR BUSINESS IN RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS. AND THEY WERE THINKING OF SUING IF NOT GRANDFATHERED. NOW YOU ARE ASKING US TO BELIEVE THAT THOSE PEOPLE LEGALLY ESTABLISH THEIR SHORT TERM RENTAL BUSINESS AND I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS DEBATABLE AND MAYBE CAN ONLY BE SETTLED BY TAKING IT TO COURT TO FIND OUT. IF YOU DON'T DO THAT IF YOU JUST TAKE IT FOR GRANTED THEY WERE LEGALLY ESTABLISHED THEY BE LEGAL NON-CONFORMING PROPERTIES, THEY WILL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE THAT BUSINESS, THEY WILL BE ABLE TO SELL TO OTHER PEOPLE, WHO WOULD CONTINUE THAT BUSINESS. IT ONLY WOULD STOP IF THEY CEASE OPERATING IN THAT WAY FOR AT LEAST A YEAR OR IF THEIR PROPERTY IS DAMAGED IN SUCH A WAY THAT IT CAN'T BE REPAIRED FOR LESS THAN AT LEAST HALF OF THE RE-ESTABLISHMENT REPAIR COST AS AN ASSESSED VALUE OF THE PROPERTY. SO YOU NEED TO TAKE THIS VERY SERIOUSLY THAT YOU ARE DOING THIS HELP THESE GUYS THEY WILL NOT SUE YOU AND THAT WILL BE GOOD FOR THE CITY. BUT YOU WILL NOT BE DOING ANYTHING FOR THE PEOPLE WHO BROUGHT THE PROBLEMS TO THE CITY IN THE FIRST PLACE. THOSE WILL CONTINUE AS WELL. THIS IS COMPLICATED BY CHANGES IN DEFINITIONS AND CLEARLY UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES, SO WHAT I WOULD ASK IS THAT YOU TAKE THIS BACK HOLD OFF FOR A WHILE, ALLOW SOME SIGNIFICANT ENGAGEMENT AND TRY TO DEVELOP A SIGNIFICANT SOLUTION WITH BETTER NOTICE. THERE MUST BE WAYS TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM THAN TO DECLARE THAT THERE WAS LEGALLY ESTABLISHED IN THE FIRST PLACE. THANK YOU.
01:09:00.423: >> THANK YOU.

01:09:22.212: >> THANK YOU. MY NAME IS CAROL SCALA AND I OWN A SHORT TERM RENTAL. AT 1524 MARION. WE HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS PROCESS WITH CITY COUNCIL AND THE ORDINANCE FOR ALMOST TWO YEARS NOW AND THE ARGUMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN VOICED BY PRIOR CALLERS ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE ARE OPERATING HOTELS IN RESIDENTIAL AREAS THAT WE IMPACT AFFORDABLE HOUSING, THAT WE WILL BE GRANT AD MONOPOLY AND THAT WE ARE -- WE HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON COMMUNITY ENVIRONMENT IN NEIGHBORHOODS, THESE ARE ARGUMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN HASHED OUT AND REHASHED AT COUNCIL MEETINGS FOR OVER A YEAR NOW. I THINK THAT THOSE ARGUMENTS WERE HEARD, COUNCIL MADE A DECISION THEY VOTED A REQUEST THAT DIRECTED CITY STAFF TO GRANT SOME FAIRNESS TO THOSE OWNERS WHO HAD BEEN LEGALLY AND THEY WERE LEGAL BECAUSE THERE WAS NOTHING IN PLACE IN THE CITY CODE THAT SAID THAT WE WERE NOT LEGAL. WE FOLLOWED ALL THE PROCEDURES, GOT THE PERMITS WE NEEDED WE WERE RENTING OUR HOUSE LIKE ANYBODY ELSE. SO I DON'T THINK THAT REALLY COMES INTO PLAY. MY CONCERN IS AND I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL OF YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO CONSIDER THIS AND TO CONSIDER A VOTE AND SPECIFICALLY TO TO MR. LENART FOR DOING THE WORK TO GET THIS TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION WHICH WAS WHERE WE THOUGHT IT SHOULDAVE BEEN ALL ALONG. OUR CONCERN RIGHT NOW IS THERE ARE A LOT OF DETAILS THAT HAVEN'T BEEN FINALIZED. IF THE ABSENCE OF THOSE DETAILS AT THIS POINT WOULD IMPACT SOME SORT OF LEGAL LOOP HOLE WHERE WE WOU EVENTUALLY NOT BE GRANTED LEGAL N-CONFORMING STATUS. I KNOW THAT IT'S WRITT, IT SAYSHAT W WILL GET IT. T I THI OUR GROUP WANTS A TTLE MORE ASRANCE IDETAILS THATCTUALLY ISOING TO PPEN. WOULDN'TANT TO S THI PASS D THEN SOMEH GETS TOWN BACK TO COUNLOR A VOTE A FIND OUTHAT THERE'S SEOOP HOLE THAT OUR OPPONEN CAN STEP A S WELLANNG COISONIDN'TO THISND THEY DIDN' --OT THEIR Is D Ts SO WE ARE THROWING IT OUT AGAIN. SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO MAKE SURE THAT DETAILS ARE HAMMERED OUT AND IN WRITING WE ARE ASSURED THAT WHAT THE MAYOR WANTED FOR US AND COUNCIL WANTED FOR US THAT THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. THANK YOU.

01:13:41.137: >> MY NAME IS KATIE AND I'M A SHORT TERM RENTAL OWNER AT 120 PARK AVENUE. I WANTED TO CALL IN TO MAKE A FEW COMMENTS ABOUT THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS. I THINK AGAIN WE HAVE BEEN AT THIS FOR ABOUT 18 MONTHS, BEEN A LONG HAUL, A LOT OF CONCERNS OF CALLERS HAVE BEEN VOICED NUMEROUS TIMES AT CITY COUNCIL MEETINGS. BUT I THINK FUNDAMENTAL LITTLE FOR THE SHORT TERM RENTERS -- RENTAL OWNERS HAVE HAVE BEEN OPERATING THUS FAR LEGALLY, THIS REALLY COMES DOWN TO PROPERTY RIGHTS AND A PROTECTION OF OUR PROPERTY RIGHTS. TO LEGALLY OPERATE OUR RENTAL BUSINESS. AS YOU ALL KNOW THERE WAS NO DESIGNATION PRIOR TO THIS ORDINANCE OF A SHORT TERM OR LONG TERM RENTER. SO THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT, I THINK ALTHOUGH THE AMENDMENTS HERE FOR THE UDC APPEAR TO BE FAVORABLE WHICH IS A HUGE RELIEF FOR US AND FEELS LIKE A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION, I FEEL LIKE THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS ABOUT WHAT IS THE SPECIFIC CRITERIA TO IDENTIFY THESE PRE-EXISTING STRs, WE NEED MORE CLARITY PROVIDED IN THIS AMENDMENT TO ENSURE FOLKS LIKE ME WHO HAVE BEEN OPERATING LEGALLY THAT OUR PROPERTY RIGHTS WILL BE MAINTAINED. THE CITY INDICATES IT IS CONSIDERING AMENDMENTS TO ALLOW LEGAL OPERATING STR STAFF PROTECTION AS LEGAL NON-CONFORMING PROPERTIES BUT THIS IS NOT A GUARANTEE, AS IT IS NOT PASSED YET CITY COUNCIL TO WE HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THIS PROTECTION WILL BE GIVEN AND WHOM IT WILL BE GIVEN. REALLY WHAT A POINT THAT IS UNCLEAR TO ME AT THIS POINT IS IF THIS AMENDMENT PASS TOSS THE UDC TONIGHT, IN ABSENCE OF CITY ORDINANCE AMENDMENT WILL STRs BE GRANTED PREEXISTING STR DEGRANTED LEGAL NON-CONFORMING STATUS IF THAT CITY ORDINANCE IS NOT AMENDED WHERE DO WE STAND AT THAT POINT. SO I GUESS WE HAVE SOME OPEN QUESTIONS BEFORE THIS GOES TO VOTE THAT NEEDS TO BE ANSWERED. THAT IS ALL I HAVE. THANK YOU.

I THINK FOR THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE THESE SHORT TERM RENTALS OUT THEIR PERMISSIONS AND THINGS BEFOREHAND THIS IS A GOOD THING FOR THEM. A COUPLE OF COMMENTS RELATED TO THE PERSON WHO WAS THE GEO THAT WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THE COST OF THE WHAT IT COSTS FOR AN APARTMENT FOR RENT I WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT I THINK SOMETIMES THE RENT IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE AMOUNT OF TAXES AND THE HOUSE THAT I LIVED IN BEFORE, I GOT MARRIED I RENTED OUT FOR 25 YEARS AND MY DAUGHTER IS LIVING THERE NOW SO I DON'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH RENTAL STUFF ANY MORE. THE TAXES ON THE HOUSE DIRECTLY PLAY A ROLE IN THE RENT THAT YOU HAVE TO CHARGE. AS WE KNOW THE TAXES IN ANN ARBOR ARE VERY HIGH, THAT IS A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP TO THE RENT THAT IS CHARGED. IN TERMS OF THE COMMENT THE PERSON MADE ABOUT CHANGING THE CHARACTER OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD WITH THESE IN AND OUTS, I JUST QUESTION THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SOMEONE BEING THERE 30 DAYS AND SOMEONE BEING THERE THREE DAYS THESE PEOPLE SAY THEY WANT THESE LONG TERM RENTERS BUT YOU CAN RENT IT OUT FOR LIKE 30 OR 31 DAYS NO SURE WHAT THE CUT OFF IS, YOU ARE STILL GOING TO HAVE TURN OVER THERE. AND SOME OF THESE PEOPLE ARE COMING IN BECAUSE THEY HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS THAT ARE GOING THROUGH CHEMOTHERAPY AT THE HOSPITAL OR WHATEVER, THEY CAN'T BE IN AN APARTMENT, I HAD A FAMILY MEMBER WHO LIVEDDED IN MILWAUKEE AND WENT TO CLEVELAND TO THE CLEVELAND CLINIC. THEY TOOK THEIR WHOLE FAMILY. THEY HAD TWO TWINS THAT WERE NINE AND ANOTHER CHILD 7 THEY COULDN'T BE IN A HOTEL. IT WAS A WHOLE FAMILY THING SO THERE IS DEFINITELY A NEED FOR THAT WITH US BEING RIGHT NEXT TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AND THEN MY LAST COMMENT IS, THIS WHOLE THING STARTED BECAUSE THERE WERE ALL THESE COMPLAINTS ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING. I HAVE YET TO HEAR OF ONE COMPLAINT ABOUT BEHAVIOR AT SHORT TERM RENTAL SINCE THOSE PUBLIC MEETINGS WHERE THE GUY WAS TALKING ABOUT SOMEBODY WAS ON THE ROOF AND DOING ALL THESE CRAZY THINGS, I HAVE NOT HEARD ONE INSTANCE OF COMPLAINT LIKE THAT AND I WOULD BE REALLY INTERESTED TO KNOW HOW MANY COMPLAINTS IS THE CITY HAS GOTTEN FROM THESE SHORT TERM RENTAL PROPERTIES THAT YOU MAY NOT KNOW THAT SHORT TERM RENTAL BUT HOW MANY COMPLAINTS HAVE YOU GOTTEN WITH BEHAVIOR LIKE THAT THAT YOU CAN THEN TIE THAT COMPLAINT WITH THESE REGISTRATIONS THAT ARE COMING IN. I THINK THAT WOULD BE AN INTERESTING THING TO KNOW BECAUSE I HAVEN'T HEARD A LOT OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT THEM. ANYWAY, THANK YOU AGAIN FOR CONSIDERING THIS. I THINK THIS IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. IT IS VERY COMPLICATED AND I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU ARE DOING. THANK YOU.
01:20:01.083: >> THANK YOU.
01:20:11.193: >> CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 400. CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 400. PRESS "*" 6 TO UNMUTE YOUR PHONE.
01:20:29.078: >> THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. YOUR WILLING TO SERVE OUR CITY IS ADMIRABLE. MY NAME IS BEN, I'M A RESIDENT OF ANN ARBOR IN THE SMITH WARD AT 1518 DEXTER AVENUE. SHORT TERM RENTAL IS FIVE DOORS DOWN, THE STREET FROM MY HOME AND I TAKE GREAT PRIDE KEEPING UP MAINTENANCE AND GETTING TO KNOW MY NEIGHBORS. I ATTENDED LAST YEARS PUBLIC MEETING LIKE MANY RESIDENTS DID THE GENERAL CONSENSUS MY OPINION WAS THAT SOME REGULATION WAS NEEDED, ALL OUT BAN WAS NOT WANTED A RECOMMENDATION FOR CONSULTING GROUP IN CHARGE OF THE TALKS IGNORED HAD ATTENDEES ASKED FOR, I STRONGLY FEEL THE RESULTING ORDINANCE IS IN DRACONIAN VIOLATION OF MY RIGHT OF THE PROPERTY OWNER. I AGREE APPROPRIATE DATA SHOULD BE COLLECTED. AND I HAVE BEEN SAYING THIS FROM THE BEGINNING. IN FACT MYSELF AND SEVERAL OTHER STR OWNERS HAVE OFFERED TO ASSIST THE CITY AND ENDEAVOR. THIS HAS BEEN A TUMULTUOUS YEAR AND ONE THE RESIDENTS HAVE BENEFITED FROM HAVING STR IN NEIGHBORS. HERE IS A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES. WE RECENTLY HOST AD FAMILY WHO LIVES IN THE FIFTH WARD AND WAS UNDERGOING A MAJOR HOME RENOVATION, THEY RANGED THE PLACE AND TOWN TO LIVE DURING RENOVATION BUT CONTRACTOR REQUESTED TO START RENOVATION SOONER THAN ORIGINALLY PLANNED THE FAMILY NEEDED A SHORT SHORT SHORT TERM RENAL OPTION WITHIN THE NEIGHBORHOOD TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THEIR WORK FROM HOME SLASH SCHOOL TEAM. WE WERE ABLE TO STEP IN AND PROVIDE FURNISHED FULLY TURNKEY PROPERTY THE FILL IN THE GAP IN HOUSING NEEDS. WE EVEN WERE ABLE TO TRANSITION ONE BEDROOM TO A HOME OFFICE WITH AMPLE TABLE SPACE FOR ALL THEM TO WORK AT. IN ADDITION TO THAT I HAD A NEIGHBOR WHO LIVES WE SHARE THE SAME BACKYARD. JUST EMAIL ME ABOUT ME DETAILS AND HOW HER FRIEND CAN RENT THE HOUSE SHORT TERM BASIS SO THEY CAN SAFELY MEET TIME TOGETHER AND WE CONTINUE TO GET REQUESTS SUCH AS THIS ALL THE TIME. THESE ARE ANN ARBOR FAMILIES AND MY NEIGHBORS IN ADDITION TO THE THOUSAND FAMILY WHOSE VISITED EVERY YEAR FOR A COMPLICATED MEDICAL PROCEDURE THE DESIRE TO HAVE SHORT TERM RENTALS CLOSE BY, THE VALUE HAVING SHORT SHORT TERM RENTAL OPTIONS WITHIN OUR CITY AND NEIGHBORHOODS. I'M ASKING THE PLANNING COMMISSIONERS TO LISTEN TO US. SHORT TERM RENTAL OWNERS HAVE STEPPED UP IN A BIG WAY TO PROVIDE HOUSING TO THE MANY MORE STUDENTS WHO WILL BE ENFORCED OUT OF THE DORMS, I FULLY UNDERSTAND THESE DAYS WILL BE LONGER THAN REQUIRED 30 DAYS AND ARE IN ACCORDANCE WITH CURRENT ORDINANCE BUT ALL OUT BAN NON-PRINCIPLE RESIDENCES SHORT TERM RENTALS AND STUDENTS WOULD BE FORCED TO MOST FROM CITY AND AWAY FROM PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS. IN SHORT ALL OUR GUESTS ARE NOT JUST STRANGERS JUST PASSING THROUGH TAKING UP RESOURCE AND ACT IN A MANNER THAT JUSTIFIES THE SANCTITY OF OUR NEIGHBORHOOD. WE ARE CONNECTED TO UNIVERSITY AND HOSPITAL. THEY CARE ABOUT ANN ARBOR AND --
01:23:36.832: >> THANK YOU.
01:23:39.001: >> LIKE WE ALL DO.
01:23:40.936: >> THANK YOU.
01:23:42.438: >> AND DIRECCITY COUNCIL THE APPROVE PASSAGE.
01:23:46.742: >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO JOIN T QUEUE TO SPEAK TO THIS ITEM YOU CAN PRESS "*" 9 ONOUR TONE.
01:23:54.617: >> CALLER WH PNE NUMBER ENDI WIT 464.
01:24:04.727: >> THI IS LINDA 4 IS (IUDIBLE) STREET I WANT -- WANTED TO ME SURE -- (INDIBLE) BICS THIS VIEW OF THE QUESTION BETWEEN OUR GOALS OF INCREASING HOUSING FOR PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN LONG TERM, AS HOMEOWNERS OR AS RENTERS. THAT'S MAJOR COMMUNITY GOAL. WHAT I'M HEARING FROM A LOT OF SHORT TERM RENTAL PEOPLE IS THEY ARE ALL AMERICANS OUT HERE WHICH IS THE CAPITALIZATION OF PROPERTY VALUES. MAKING A PROFIT ON YOUR PRIVATE PROPERTY. THAT'S A LONG STANDING AMERICAN VALUE AND I REALIZE THAT. BUT IT SHOULD BE CLEAR THOSE ARE TWO OPPOSING VALUES. AND I GUESS A PERSONALLY COME DOWN THE FIRST RATHER THAN SECOND BUT THAT'S JUST ME. SO IT LOOKS LIKE COUNCIL HAS DECIDED TO DO GRANDFATHERING IN NOT BECAUSE I FEW THEY VALUE HAVING SHORT TERM RENTALS TAKE UP PERMANENT HOUSING STAFF IN RESIDENTIAL AREAS BUT BECAUSE THEY ARE AFRAID OF LAW SUITS. THEY KEYED TO THAT, MADE A DECISION TO GRANDFATHER. WHEN -- BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND I ALSO -- I DON'T HAVE DATES OR RECORDING HANDY. I ALSO REMEMBER COUNCIL RATHER THAN COMMON LAW DEFINITION OF GRANDFATHERING WHICH IS IS THE CANCER TO THE PROPERTY I THOUGHT THEY ASKED PLANNING COMMISSION TO LOOK AT GRANDFATHERING IN FOR THE CURRENT -- THE ONES WHO WILL LEGAL WHO HAD CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCIES AS OF YESTERDAY MARCH 1, GRANDFATHERING THEM IN EARLY WHILE THEY RETAIN OWNERSHIP OF THAT PROPERTY. THAT WOULD THEN BE LOST ONCE THE PROPERTY IS TRANSFERRED. SO WHEN YOU GO BACK TO DEBATING OF COMMISSIONERS, AS MATERIAL COMMISSION I ASK THAT YOU ASK LENART SPECIFIC LIP IF THAT'S HIS MEMORY OVER TYPE OF DIRECTIVE AND HOW THAT GOT MORE TO NOW CONSIDERING KEEPING THAT GRANDFATHERING IN TO ME WHAT THE PROPERTY IS FROM ONE OWNER TO ANOTHER. I BESEECH YOU TO ASK TO HAVE A OPEN DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT SPECIFIC QUESTION, WHILE SOME OF THE INTERESTING PEOPLE ATTENDING THIS HEARING. THANK YOU.
01:26:47.756: >> THANK YOU.
01:26:54.797: >> ANYONE ELSE WHO WISHES TO JOIN THE QUEUE, PRESS "*" 9 ON YOUR PHONE.
01:26:59.168: >> CALLER WITH PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 820. CALLER WITH PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 820. CAN PRESS "*" 6 TO UNMUTE YOUR PHONE AND ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
01:27:12.347: >> CAN YOU HEAR ME?
01:27:14.049: >> WE CAN.
01:27:16.485: >> THIS IS (INAUDIBLE) BEFORE I RESPOND TO COUPLE OF COMMENTS BY FOLKS -- FOLKS WHO ARE ON SHORT TERM RENTALS, ONE BEING THE ONE WHO SAID THAT SHE HASN'T HEARD OF ANY COMPLAINTS, I CAN CERTAINLY GIVE YOU ONE ABOUT THE SHORT TERM RENTAL PROPERTY THAT EXIST ON MY STREET IN TERMS OF PARTYING, THE BEER LEFT IN THE STREET, PARTIES DURING THE PANDEMIC, OBVIOUS CROWDS, NOISE, THOSE COMPLAINTS EXIST AND ARE ENDEMIC TO AIR B AND Bs SO THAT KIND OF GOES WITHOUT QUESTION. WITH THE OTHER POINT ABOUT PEOPLE PROVIDING A SERVICE TO MAYBE FAMILIES WHO ARE IN NEED OF SHORT TERM RENTALS PEOPLE WHO ARE SICK IN NEED OF SHORT TERM RENTALS THAT IS NOBLE AND GREAT BUT THIS DOESN'T GET RID OF SHORT TERM RENTALS PERIOD. IT JUST GETS RID OF THEM IN RESIDENTIAL AREAS PEOPLE WHO NEED THOSE TYPE OF SERVICES BUT SEEK THEM OUT WHETHER SHORT TERM RENTAL IN A MIXED AREA NEIGHBORHOOD OR AT EXTENDED STAY HOTEL. AND THE FINAL POINT I WANTED TO MAKE ONE ONE MOMENT PLEASE. IS THAT INVESTORS WHO HAVE SHORT TERM RENTALS, WHO ARE ABLE TO MAKE MONEY OFF HAIR PROPERTIES THROUGH -- WHETHER IT IS THE 30 DAY PERIOD WHETHER THAN THREE DAYS SOMEBODY BROUGHT UP OR IN TRADITIONAL LEASES THAT GO TOWARD ESTABLISHING FOLKS WHO MIGHT WANT TO STAY IN THE CITY LONGER. SO I JUST DON'T APPRECIATE SOME OF THE MORE BAD FAITH EXAMPLES THAT ARE COME UP HERE FROM FOLKS WHO OWN SHORT TERM RENTAL PROPERTIES. AND I OFTEN WANT TO CHALLENGE THE IDEA THAT OH PEOPLE HAVE SAID THESE CONCERNS BEFORE, SO WHAT DOES IT MATTER TO HEAR THEM AGAIN. THAT SHOULD BE A QUEUE THAT SOMETHING IS WRONG HERE WHEN COUNTLESS RESIDENCE BROUGHT UP ISSUES WITH SHORT TERM RENTALS WHERE WE HAD AN ORDINANCE PASS ISSUES AND NOW WE ARE WALKING IT BACK. THAT'S WHY YOU HEAR THE SAME CONCERNS BECOME BROUGHT UP OVER AND OVER AGAIN. AND THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY. THANK YOU.
01:29:47.369: >> THANK YOU. IF ANYONE IS LISTENING THROUGH THE TV NOW IS YOUR TIME TO CALL IN. ONCE YOU HAVE DIALED IN ENTERED THE MEETING ID NUMBER IT IS STAR 9 TO RAISE YOUR HAND. WE HAVE ONE MORE PERSON IN THE QUEUE NOW.
01:30:08.323: >> CALLER WITH PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 014. WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 014, THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
01:30:17.032: >> THIS IS BARRY, I HAVE A SHORT TERM RENTAL ON PACKARD AVENUE. I DID WANT TO REITERATE THE SERVICE WE ARE PROVIDING AND THE POSITIVE ASPECTS WE ARE BRINGING TO THE COMMUNITY. RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WERE TAKEN OUT OF THEIR DORM AND SOME HAVE JOBS AND RESEARCH POSITIONED AT THE UNIVERSITY AND IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THOSE THEY HAD TO STAY IN TOWN AND THEY HAVE SINCE TAKEN UP RESIDENTS IN OUR RENTALS AND HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CONTINUE THOSE ACTIVITIES. ALSO DURING THE QUARANTINE'S A NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT COME BACK TO ANN ARBOR WHO HAD TO COME TO PLACES WHERE THERE'S SEPARATE ENTRANCES AND NEEDS TO STAY FOR TWO WEEKS AND THEY WANTED TO BE WITH THEIR FAMILIES, BUT THEY NEEDED TIME TO BE BY THEMSELVES TO BE SAFE. WE HAVE HAD MANY PEOPLE UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES. SO THE REASONS ARE VARIED. BUT BY AND LARGE ANN ARBOR IS A FAIRLY SIZABLE TOWN IN ADDITION TO PEOPLE COMING FOR WORK ASSIGNMENTS FOR SEVERAL WEEKS AND HOSPITAL ASSIGNMENTS AND VISITING NURSES, THE NUMBERS ARE JUST IN NUMBER OF REASONS ARE SO MANY. THAT THE VOLUME OF SHORT TERM RENTALS THAT WE HAVE NOW REALLY DOES PROVIDE A SERVICE. SO IF THERE IS A CAP SO BE IT BUT ONE CAN POINT TO THE FACT THAT WE ARE FULFILLING A NEED FOR TOWN OUR SIZE, IT IS A PART OF THE COMMUNITY AT THIS POINT. SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE COUNCIL TO SUPPORT THESE AMENDMENTS. THANK YOU.
01:32:03.905: >> THANK YOU. FOR THOSE WHO DIALED IN, FOR THOSE LISTENING, THIS IS YOUR FINAL OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION FOR THIS PUBLIC HEARING.
01:32:34.803: >> WE DID RECEIVE AN EMAIL FROM MS. JAMIE C CLINXTON WHO WAS UNABLE ATTEND AND PARTICIPATE BUT PROVIDED WRITTEN COMMENTS ASK THOSE TO BE INCLUDE MANY THE RECORD. AS THOSE SHARE IN WRITE AGO INTEND TO ADD THOSE TO PUBLIC RECORD. I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT, THAT WAS PROVIDED TO YOU AS WELL.
01:32:53.488: >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE GOT A THICK PACKET THIS WEEK. DIGITAL PACKET ON THIS END OTHER ISSUES. OKAY. LET ME FIND MY SCRIPT AGAIN.
01:33:08.470: >> THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION RECOMMENDS THE MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL APPROVE AMENDMENTS TO CHAPTER 55 UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE PERMITTED USE TABLE 5.15-1 ACCESSORY USE TABLE 5.15-2 NON-CONFORMING SECTION 5.33, AND SPECIFIC TERMS SECTIONS 5.37.2. P AND 5.37.2. S MOVED BY COMMISSIONER DISCH, SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER GIBB RANDAL. LET'S HAVE DISCUSSION, TAKE A BREAK AFTER WE ARE DONE WITH THIS ONE IF THAT IS OKAY. COMMISSIONER DISCH.
01:33:50.011: >> THANK YOU COMMISSIONER MILLS. SO I WOULD LIKE TO TO MAKE A CLARIFICATION AND ASK A QUESTION OF MR. LENART. MY CLARIFICATION IS TO THE CALLERS AND I WANT TO SAY MANY OF YOU HAVE SPOKEN ELOQUENTLY ABOUT THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS IN ANN ARBOR AND I SHARE YOUR CONCERNS ABOUT THIS CRISIS, IT IS UNDENIABLE, IT HURTS THIS CITY WHEN PEOPLE WHO ARE ESSENTIAL WORKERS CANNOT LIVE WHERE THEY WORK. AND SO AS COUNCIL CONSIDERS THIS ISSUE GOING FORWARD I HOPE YOU WILL MAKE ALL THESE ARGUMENTS AGAIN BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE TO SEE US CONSIDER LIMITING NON-PRINCIPLE RESIDENTS STRs IN MIXED USE ZONING DISTRICTS JUST AS WE ARE LIMITING THEM IN SINGLE FAMILY ZONING DISTRICTS SO I URGE YOU NOT TO FEEL YOU ARE DONE HAVING SPOKEN THIS EVENING. I WANT TO CLARIFY THAT THE ROLE OF THE PLANNING COMMISSION TONIGHT IS NOT TO DECIDE WHETHER ESTABLISHING LEGAL NON-CONFORMING STATUS IS A GOOD THING TO DO. IT IS NOT TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT LEGAL NON-CONFORMING STATUS OUGHT TO BE WRITTEN INTO THE UDC. THESE QUESTIONS ARE FOR COUNCIL TO DECIDE. PLANNINGOMMISSION IS NOT APPROVING ANYTHING TONIGHT AS RESPONDING TO A REQUEST FROM COUNCIL WHICH ASKED THE PLANNING COMMISSION TO TELL COUNCIL HOW TO MAKE THIS AMENDMENT TO CHAPTER 97 IF COUNCIL DECIDES THAT THE AMENDMENT IS NECESSARY OR DESIRABLE. AS COUNCIL CONSIDERS THAT QUESTION IT'S MEMBERS MAY WANT TO KNOW HOW MANY PROPERTIES QUALIFY FOR LEGALLY NON-CONFORMING USES BUT THAT INFORMATION DOES NOT BEAR ON THE TASK THAT'S BEFORE THE PLANNING COMMISSION TONIGHT. SO THAT'S THE CLARIFICATION AND I'M ALWAYS WILLING TO TAKE CORRECTIONS ON MY CLARIFICATION IF I MESS SOMETHING UP SLIGHTLY OR VAGUELY. WHAT'S THAT. AND MR. LENART I WANT TO ASK YOU WAS IT YOUR UNDERSTANDING THAT COUNCIL ASKED THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT TO GIVE COUNCIL A WAY TO GRANT LEGAL NON-CONFORMING STATUS TO THE CURRENT OWNER OF A PROPERTY BEING USED AS AN STR NON-PRINCIPLE REDENCE IN SINGLE FAMILY ZONE AND THEN TO ENABLES TO SWI THAT STATUS IF AROPERTY WERE SOLD? ASKING FOR AND IF THAT WEERE SOMETHING WE WERE ASKINIS THAT SOMETHINGOU COULD DO GIVEN CONSTRAINTHOW ZONING WKS AND HOW PEOPLE L EXPECT TO WORK (
01:36:22.364: >> COUNCIL DECTION WAS WHI IT DIDN'T SPECICALLY USE THE RMON-CONFORMINT SPECIFALLY SAIDREATE THE PROPRIATE REGUTORY STRUCTU TO EBLE T CONTIED OPATION OF PRE-EXISTIN SHORT TERMENLS SO STAFF AND CORRESPONDINGLY I'M PRESENTING TO YOU I THINK A MECHANISM TO DO THAT, IS TO USE NON-CONFORMING ZONING STATUS. TO ACCOMPLISH THAT, THAT IS A FRAMEWORK OF OUR ORDINANCE AND LAW THAT PROVIDES FOR THAT EFFECT TO OCCUR. TO ALLOW THE CONTINUED OPERATION OF SOMETHING THAT MAY BE AS PRIOR TO APPLICATION OF REGULATION. IT -- THE LANGUAGE IS SPECIFIC TO CONTINUED OPERATION. SO I DON'T THINK THAT IT WAS EXPLICITLY DIRECTING US TO CONSIDER SOME SORT OF SUNSET OR AMORTIZATION OR GOAL OF REDUCING THAT NUMBER. NOT TO SAY THAT IS NOT A GOAL THAT COULDN'T BE CONSIDERED OR CUSSED BUT THAT IS NOT EXPLICIT OR INHERENT IN THE DIRECTION I SEE THE RESOLUTION. ONE COMMENT REGARDING WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO THIS PROPOSED SET OF ORDINANCES IF IT WERE PASSED BY PLANNING COMMISSION AND NOT CITY COUNCIL. THAT WOULD HAVE EFFECT OF NO CHANGE TO REGULATORY STRUCTURE SO THE PLANNING COMMISSION IS A RECOMMENDING BODY IN THIS REGARD AND MAKE A RECOMMENDATION TO CITY COUNCIL REGARDING ANY ORDINANCE CHANGES. IF CITY COUNCIL WERE TO NOT ENACT THEM THERE WOULD BE NO ORDINANCE IMPACT, THE -- THEY WOULD HAVE NO BINDING EFFECT ON ITS OWN.
01:38:23.151: >> I THINK COMMISSIONER DISCH CLARIFICATION THAT 99% OF ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WAS IN MY MIND OR THAT CAME UP, I JUST WANT TO GO A LITTLE BIT FURTHER TO ASK ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS ANY -- WHETHER THERE ARE ANY EXISTING EXAMPLES WITHIN THE UDC IN TERMS OF DEALING WITH LEGAL NON-CONFORMITIES THAT END WITH OWNERSHIP. I THINK THAT WAS THE DISTINCTION THAT SOME PEOPLE WERE MAKING ABOUT CARRYING ON EVEN TO A NEW OWNER VERSUS SOMETHING ENDING IN OWNERSHIP AND DO WE HAVE ANYTHING THAT OPERATES THAT WAY? IN THE UDC?
01:39:10.431: >> I'M IN THE AWARE OF THAT.
01:39:14.636: >> THANK YOU. SO IN TERMS OF THE DIRECTION THAT YOU GOT, THIS IS THE WAY THAT WE TYPICALLY ENABLE THOSE EXISTING USES THEY NOT BE LEGAL ANY LONGER. GOING FORWARD, THIS IS THE KIND OF LANGUAGE THAT WE TYPICALLY USE. THANK YOU.
01:39:29.317: >> OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS OR DISCUSSION COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT?
01:39:32.453: >> EVEN IF THIS IS LANGUAGE THAT WE TYPICALLY USE, ARE THERE ALTERNATIVES THAT SHOULD BE LOOKED AT, I WILL JUST SAY FOR THE RECORD LIKE I WOULD BE MORE COMFORTABLE IF THE USE WAS TERMINATED WHICH SOUNDS LIKE PEOPLE ASSUMED I ASSUMED THAT. I WOULD BE MORE COMFORTABLE IF SOMEBODY SOLD THIS LEGAL NON-CONFORMING STR THAT IT WOULDN'T CONTINUE FOR THE NEW OWNER. SO LIKE ARE THERE MECHANISMS TO DO THAT EVEN IF IT'S SOMETHING WE HAVEN'T DONE IN ANN ARBOR?
01:40:01.849: >> I WOULDN'T ADVISE IT TO HAPPEN IN THE ZONING UDC. YOU MAY -- TRYING TO REMEMBER YOUR TENURE WITH THE PLANNING COMMISSION TO TELL RELATIVE TO DISCUSSION OF SIGN ORDINANCE AND LIGHTING. IN BOTH CIRCUMSTANCES ZONING AGAIN IS PROSPECTIVE. SO WHEN THOSE REGULATIONS CHANGE THERE ARE BY CONVECTION AND LAW RIGHTS MAINTAINED BY THE PROPERTY. THAT ARE NOT DEPENDENT ON OWNERSHIP. IF THE PLANNING COMMISSION'S -- IF THE PLANNING COMMISSION RECOMMENDATION WAS THAT THAT WAS AN IMPORTANT ASPECT THEN THE ADVICE MIGHT BE NO YOU SHOULDN'T DO THIS IN UDC YOU SHOULD EXPLORE ALTERNATIVE METHODS TO DO THAT MAYBE WITHIN CHAPTER 97 OR OTHER MECHANISMS. I DON'T -- SHORT ANSWER IS I DON'T THINK THAT THE UDC IS AN APPROPRIATE PLACE FOR THAT SORT OF REMOVAL OF NON-CONFORMING STATUS FOR THIS NOR ANY PERSPECTIVE REGULATION.
01:41:13.288: >> OKAY. THANK YOU COMMISSIONER DISCH FOR THE CLARIFICATION ON WHAT OUR DIRECTIVE REALLY IS. SO WE IN THEORY COULD SAY, WE ARE RECOMMENDING A PLAN FOR PATH FORWARD TO COUNCIL TONIGHT. CORRECT? SO THE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE NUMBER AND LOCATIONS LIKE I THINK THAT IS DEFINITELY AWESOME INFORMATION, GLAD YOU ARE COLLECTING IT, TO MAP IT, I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S PRIVATE INFORMATION BUT IF IT COULD BE MADE PUBLIC. DOESN'T SOUND LIKE THAT IS IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR US TO HAVE RIGHT NOW. THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT COUNCIL MIGHT WANT. BUT FOR US TODAY THAT IS -- OKAY.
01:41:53.594: >> I THINK YES OR NO, I THINK THAT THIS APPROACH IS MAKING POLICY DECISION IF F THIS FRAMEWORK HAPPENS WHETHER ONCE IN OUR COMMUNITY OR ONCE IN 500 TIMES IN OUR COMMUNITY, THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE WAY TO LOOK AT IT FROM A REGULATORY FRAMEWORK. SO IN THAT REGARD, I DON'T THINK THE DATA MATTERS AS MUCH. IT IS AN ORDINANCE AROUND A SET OF FACTS. THAT SAID, AS YOU HEARD AND I THINK YOU ARE EXPRESSING THIS -- EXPRESSING THIS HOW YOU SEE THAT AS AN IMPACT TO OUR COMMUNITY MAYBE DIFFERENT IF IT'S A ONE OR 500 BUT I THINK IT'S PERFECTLY VALID TO LOOK AT IT BOTH WAYS, PROPOSED ORDINANCE IN FRONTS OF YOU ARE THE FORMER SETTING A PROPOSED ORDINANCE BASED ON AN OCCURRENCE I ACKNOWLEDGE I DON'T KNOW HOW FREQUENTLY IT HAS HAPPENED OR WILL HAPPEN IN OUR COMMUNITY BUT BASED ON AN ALIGNMENT OF FACTS AND PRACTICE THAT WOULD RESULT IN THAT STATUS.
01:43:04.599: >> OKAY.
01:43:06.200: >> THINK THAT IS IT FOR NOW.
01:43:07.769: >> COMMISSIONER GIBB RANDAL.
01:43:14.609: >> I CAN SEE HOW BECAUSE PART OF LIKE THIS LAST OF THE YEAR WE CRYSTALIZED THE WAY WE ARE VIEWING OUR DECISION MAKING. AROUND SUSTAINABILITY AND AFFORDABILITY. AND SO EVEN THOUGH WE MAY HAVE A NARROW SET OF THINGS WE ARE LOOKING AT TONIGHT, I FEEL LIKE WE ARE OBLIGATED TO LOOK AT IT THROUGH THAT LENS AS WELL. AND THAT THIS DOES HAVE AN IMPACT ON AFFORDABILITY BUT WE DON'T REALLY KNOW, HOW MUCH IT DOES, FOR LOT OF REASONS BUT PROBABLY IT IS HOW MANY THERE ARE. I THINK IT DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE. AND I GET IT THAT YOU NEED THE STAY IN OUR LANE BUT I ALSO FEEL LIKE AT THE VERY LEAST WE NEED TO ENIER DEA ROBUST DATA GATHERING EFFORT TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT MEANS FOR US, WE ARE BENDING OVER BACKWARDS TO FIGURE THESE OTHER WAYS TO MAKE AFFORDABILITY HAPPEN AND IF WE ARE DOING SOMETHING COMPLETELY ACROSS PURPOSES TO THAT, I DON'T KNOW, I WOULD PEEL MORE COMFORTABLE I FEEL LIKE I IMMEDIATE TO KIND OF SQUARE THOSE THINGS AGAINST EACH OTHER AND FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT I FEEL LIKE DATA IS IMPORTANT FOR US TO UNDERSTAND. TO BE PERFECTLY FRANK, I DON'T KNOW WHETHER LIKE 50 VERSUS 500, I WOULD NEED SOME SORT OF SUPPORT TO HELP US UNDERSTAND WHAT IS A RIGHT SIZE. BECAUSE I CAN COMPLETELY SEE HOW THERE IS A ROLE FOR THESE. I USE THESE THINGS. WHEN I GO TO DIFFERENT PLACE, SO I THINK THERE IS A ROLE BUT THERE ALSO I ALSO DON'T WANT A BUNCH OF EMPTY PLACES SITTING AROUND PEOPLE COULD BE LIVING IN. THAT'S REALLY LIKE THE BIG ISSUE FOR ME. I THOUGHT WE WOULD HAVE A MUCH LARGER DISCUSSION. I APPRECIATE COMMISSIONER DISHES UNDERSTANDING OF THE DECISION THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE TONIGHT. I ALSO FEEL LIKE WE DO HAVE SOME SORT OF DUTY TO LOOK AT THE BIG PICTURE AS RELATES TO OUR LARGER GOALS AROUND AFFORDABILITY. SO I VOTE FOR HOLDING OFF AND GETTING MORE DATA SO THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT SORT OF IMPACT IT HAS. ON THOSE GOALSNA WE ARE WORKING AROUND ALL THE TIME WHEN MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT SITE PLANS IN OUR CITY.
01:45:52.667: >> JUST FOR CLARITY FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IN TERMS OF THE DATA THAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR THIS IS THE WAITING UNTIL THE END OF THE MONTH TO FIGURE OUT HOW MANY PEOPLE THERE ARE THAT ARE IN THIS LEGAL NON-CONFORMING STATUS.
01:46:08.349: >> HOW MANY PEOPLE THERE ARE IN ALSO SOME SUPPORT ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS. I DON'T FEEL LIKE I'M QUALIFIED TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT RIGHT SIZING IS. IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT SOME SORT OF REAL ESTATE ECONOMIST ORION WHO THAT IS TO HELP US FIGURE THAT OUT. BUT I FEEL LIKE I PERSONALLY NEED SOME SUPPORT TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT NEEDS TO BE IN ORDER TO HAVE ENOUGH BUT NOT TOO MANY TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A -- SO IT DOESN'T HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON AFFORDABILITY. SUPPLY IS A HUGE PART OF AFFORDABILITY, JUST IS. TAXES YES LIKE ONE OF THE CALLERS WAS SAYING, MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE BUT SUPPLY ALSO HAS A HUGE IMPACT ON THAT. SO I WOULD SAY WAIT FOR THE DATA AND IF IT'S POSSIBLE TO GET SOMEBODY TO HELP US UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT -- WHAT THAT MEANS FOR US SO WE CAN UNDERSTAND HOW WE ARE HOW WE ARE HEADING TOWARDS OUR GOALS OF AFFORDABILITY AND WHERE WE MAY BE SAYRY FROM IT OR NOT. HOW MUCH WE ARE VEERING FROM IT. I GUESS IS WHAT I'M -- THAT'S WHAT I'M CONVINCED ABOUT.
01:47:30.598: >> MR. LENART, YOU WANTED TO CHIME IN.
01:47:33.968: >> YEAH. THANK YOU. SO TO COMMISSIONER GIBB RANDAL YOUR COMMENTS AND -- WELL LETE START GENERALLY. I BELIEVE THE COUNCIL DIRECTION TO YOU IS PRETTY NARROWLY TAILORED. AS YOU KNOW I'M NOT THE BOSS OF YOU. YOU ARE A BODY THAT SPEAKS AS A BODY AND PROVIDES COUNCIL TO THE COUNCIL TO THE CITY COUNCIL. SO IF YOU BROADEN THAT, YOU BROADEN IT. TO I JUST WANT -- I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU ARE SAYING COMMISSIONER GIBB RANDAL BUT I'M TRYING TO RECONCILE THAT WITH SORT OF COUNCIL ALREADY ESTABLISHED.TY SO IN THE RLM OF WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT OF THA DATA, MY INITIAL THOUGHT MAYBE I'M NOT MISUNDERSTANDING I IT IT'S Y RE TRYING TO UNDERSTANDHAT ISDEQUACY OR FOR OUR MMUNITY, WHASYCESSIVE O NOT ENOU. I WOULD JUST SAYHATHIS CITY COUNL IN WAY IS ALREADY ME THAT DECISIONY SETTINGHAT CHAPTE97. IN THEVENT Y FOUND THE WERE 500 OF THESE ARE A TUSAND TSE OREN OF THESE, UNLESSOU AS COMMIIONER ARE INTERESTED IN VOID PROVIDING THAT ADVICE MORE BROADLY THAN WHAT COUNCIL ASK FOR I DO WONDER HOW RELEVANT IT IS TO THE ACT OF WHAT IS REGULATORY FRAMEWORK TO ACHIEVE PRETTY NARROW OUTCOME BASED ON POLICY DECISIONS ALREADY MADE. I CAN UNDERSTAND YOU MIGHT -- THE COMMISSION MIGHT DISAGREE WITH POLICY DECISIONS, THEY MIGHT HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THOSE BUT I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THAT'S BEEN MADE. SO I THINK THE DIRECTION HERE IS NOT SO MUCH ABOUT RIGHT SIZING SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR THE CHARACTERISTICS OF OUR COMMUNITY. THE COMMISSION COULD GO IN THAT DIRECTION BUT I THIS THAT'S STARTING TO PERHAPS EXPAND FROM THE DIRECTION COUNCIL WANTS TO.
01:49:46.500: >> DO YOU FEEL THERE IS NOT A ROLE AT THIS POINT TO HELP SHAPE DISCUSSION THAT WOULD HAPPEN IF CITY COUNCIL TABLE IN TERMS OF US AS RECOMMENDING BODY?
01:50:02.783: >> ABSOLUTELY BUT I THINK THAT I WOULD ASK YOU AS COMMISSION TO THINK ABOUT TO WHAT EXTENT ARE YOU GOING TO SHAPE QUESTION POSED. AND TO WHAT EXTENT SHAPE POLICY DECISIONS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN MADE. THAT -- THEY HAVEN'T WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO PLANNING COMMISSION THE CITY COUNCIL HASN'T ASKED PLANNING COMMISSION DO YOU THINK WE DID A GOOD JOB IN MAKING THESE DESIGNATIONS. NOT TO SAY THAT YOU CAN'T TELL THEM YOUR OPINION. BUT I WOULD SAY SHAPING THAT DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS NARROW FOCUS, ABSOLUTELY APPROPRIATE. NOT YOU CAN PROVIDE COUNCIL ON OTHER ASPECTS BUT I THINK THAT THAT IS STARTING TO GO MORE ON I'M COMMISSION OWN INITIATION RATHER THE THAN RESPONSIVE.
01:50:56.370: >> DO YOU FEEL LIKE THAT THEY HAVE HAD THIS DISCUSSION ALREADY IN TERMS OF THIS THIS RIGHT SIZING -- BECAUSE I GUESS I'M I WANT SOMEBODY TO HAVE THIS DISCUSSION. I GUESS IS WHAT I'M SAYING. WHETHER IT'S US OR WHETHER IT'S CITY COUNCIL OR WHATEVER BUT I THINK IT IS A REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTION. SO I DON'T WANT THE REWATCH EVERY CITY COUNCIL MEETING. DO YOU FEEL LIKE THAT DISCUSSION, YOU ATTEND THEM, SO DO YOU FEEL LIKE THAT DISCUSSION IS ALREADY HAPPEN? THERE ISN'T EVEN DATA YET. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? SO IT'S LIKE HOW WOULD THEY HAVE KNOWN THAT IF THERE WASN'T ANY MECHANISM FOR THEM TO HAVE GOTTEN THE NUMBERS IN THE FIRST PLACE AND IF IT HASN'T HAPPENED YET, IS THERE ANY WAY FOR US TO IF YOU FEEL LIKE WE ARE BREAKING OUT OF OUR LANE, IS THERE ANY WAY FOR US TO STRONGLY RECOMMEND WITH OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO BE ABLE TO ALLOW TO ENCOURAGE THAT TO BE PART OF CONVERSATION? I FEEL LIKE IT'S AN IMPORTANT THING TO DISCUSS SOMEWHERE, WHETHER HERE OR WHETHER CITY COUNCIL.
01:52:03.837: >> YEAH. AGAIN COMMISSION SHOULD SPEAK ITS HEART SO IF IF YOU THINK THAT IS IMPORTANT TO THAT DISCUSSION THAT COMES IN MANY FORMS, ACCOMPANY THIS RECOMMENDATION ON THIS, THAT IS HOWEVER YOU SHOULD ALSO DO X Y OR Z. I WOULD SAY GENERALLY, THAT YOUR CONCERNS HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED AT THE COUNCIL LEVEL AND I THINK THAT IS IN WAY THAT'S MANIFESTED IN THE ORIGINAL ADOPTION OF THE ORDINANCE AND SUBSEQUENT ACTION TRYING TO FIND WHAT THAT BALANCE IS AND WHERE THE APPROPRIATE WHAT THE APPROPRIATE RESPONSE TO THOSE DEMANDS AND PARTICIPANTS SURES AND OPPORTUNITIES AND SERVICES AND THE AFFORDABILITY AND NEIGHBORHOOD IMPACT. I THINK THAT YOU'RE -- THAT -- I WOULD TAKE THE ADOPTION AND THE RESOLUTION AS SOME ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF TENSION IN THOSE REGARDS AT COUNCIL LEVEL THAT IS NOT TO SAY THAT THAT SATISFACTORY TO HIRING AND ECONOMIST TO REVISE THEM IN A MORE DETAILED PERSPECTIVE BUT THAT IS IN THE DISCUSSION THOSE ISSUES AND THOSE MATTERS. AGAIN I WANT TO BE CLEAR, YOU CAN ADVISE COUNCIL AS BROADLY AS YOU WANT. BUT WHEN TALKING ABOUT THE NUMBER OF THESE THAT MIGHT FALL IN THIS CATEGORY, THAT SEEMS MORE RELEVANT TO THE POLICY DECISION THAT COUNCIL ALREADY MADE TO ME RATHER THAN THIS MECHANISM. YOU CAN DISAGREE WITH THAT. JUST ONE LAST POINT, FROM THE ANALYSIS, WE DID DO SOME DATA MINING WITH CONSULTANT WHEN WE FIRST DID LISTENING SESSIONS WE IDENTIFIED ABOUT A THOUSANDS PROPERTIES IN THE CITY THAT WERE RENTED ON SHORT TERM RENTAL BASIS SOME POINT OVER CALENDAR YEAR. THEY PEAKED AS ANTICIPATED. GRADUATIONK FOOTBALL GAMES AND ART FAIR, BUT THERE ABOUT A THOUSAND INSTANCES WHERE THAT OCCURRED OVER THE COURSE OF A YEAR. THAT DATA IS NOT ADDRESSES, IT IS MINED FROM DIFFERENT LISTING SITES AND IT IS NOT WITH SUCH ACCURACY THAT I CAN PRESENT THAT TO YOU AND MAP AND SAY THESE PARCEL AND NOT THOSE PARCELS. THE TRUTH IS, I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PROPERTIES ARE FALLING INTO THIS CATEGORY OF QUESTION. THAT IS THE WHOLE EXTENT OF PROPERTIES LIKELY THAT ARE POSSIBLE. I WOULDN'T EXPECT IT TO BE MUCH MORE THAN THAT. IT WOULD BE PROBABLY LESS THAN THAT BECAUSE THERE'S SOME CONSISTENT WITH CHAPTER 97 BUT I PROVIDE THAT AS A SENSE OF SCALE.
01:55:03.550: >> COMMISSIONER CLARKE AND COMMISSIONER DISCH. YOU ARE STILL ON MUTE. COMMISSIONER CLARKE.
01:55:12.392: >> SORRY ABOUT THAT.
01:55:13.794: >> I WANTED TO CLARIFY SOMETHING FROM MY UNDERSTANDING OF CENTRAL ISSUE HERE AND THE REASON THIS IS COMING BACK IS MAINLY THAT PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY INVESTED TO ME THE CENTRAL ISSUE, DID THEY WAS IT LEGAL IN THE APPROACHES THE PROPERTY AND IF SO MAKING THIS EXEMPTION IT KIND OF SEEMS LIKE WE REALLY UNORTHODOX TO MAYBE HAVE SOMETHING THAT WAS PERFECTLY LEGAL AND SOMEONE PURCHASED IT. SO MAYBE THE CORE ISSUE TO ME SEEMS MORE LIKE IF ALLOWING PEOPLE TO KEEP THAT EXCEPTION FALLS IN LINE WITH THEIR EXPECTATIONS AND THE LEGALITY OF THE USE WHEN THEY PURCHASE THE PROPERTY, AND THEN IF WE WANT TO CHANGE THAT, WE GO BACK BACK AND MAKE TURN BACK INTO HOUSING AND THINGS LIKE THAT WE HAVE EXCEPTIONS THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY AND IF THERE'S CLEARLY THESE DO SERVE -- SO THE FACT THEY EXIST IS KIND OF DIFFERENT POPULATION FOR ONE AND I THINK IT IS SAFE TO SAY WORKING IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE HAVE SERIOUS AFFORDABILITY ISSUES AND THERE ARE SERIOUS ISSUES AND ACKNOWLEDGES, IN OUR RENTAL MARKET BUT I DON'T KNOW IF WE NEED DATA TO KNOW THAT RIGHT NOW THE AMOUNT OF EXISTING AIR B AND B Z SOME SINGLE FAMILY HOUSES BUT IT IS NOT ON ANY SORT OF SCALE THAT I THINK IS REALLY DRIVING THE ISSUE. AND WE CAN LOOK AT ANOTHER CITY WHERE THIS HAS BEEN DONE AND WHAT LONG TERM LOOK AT POLICY TRAJECTORY AND ALLOWS THIS TO GO ON FOREVER I CAN SEE 20 YEARS REALLY BIG DRIVING FORCE AND COULD UNDERMINE THE MARKET BUT RIGHT NOW IT'S NOT DONE THAT SO FAR SO LOOKING FROM THE LAND USE PERSPECTIVE, WHAT THEIR EXPECTATIONS OF WHEN THEY PURCHASE AND WHAT GOING FORTH WHAT'S BEEN ORTHODOX IN THE PAST, WITH SPECIAL EXCEPTION IS PROBABLY MIGHT BE WHERE THE ISSUE LIES. SORRY ABOUT THAT.
01:57:24.625: >> COMMISSIONER DISCH.
01:57:26.426: >> HELPFUL COMMISSIONER CLARKE. I THINK HELPS SET UP WHAT I WANT TO SAY TO THE COMMISSION. IN TERMS OF SO I HEAR COMMISSIONER GIBB RANDAL SAYING THAT SHE REALLY WANTS PLANNING COMMISSION TO SPARK MEANINGFUL THOROUGH CONVERSATION ABOUT THE BROADER TENSION BETWEEN COMMERCIAL USE OF EXISTING HOUSING STOCK IN A TIGHT MARKET. AND THE VALUES THAT WE ARE ATTACHING TO AFFORDABILITY. AND SO I REALLY I APPRECIATE THAT COMMISSIONER CLARKE BROUGHT UP THE QUESTION WHETHER STRs ARE DRIVING THE AFFORDABILITY CRISIS. THERE IS NOT A LOT OF RESEARCH ON THIS. THERE IS SOME INDICATION THAT STRs IN TOURIST SECTION OF THE TOWN WHERE THERE ARE BARS AND RESTAURANTS, DO DRIVE RENTS UP. SO SOME THESE LEGALLY NON-CONFORMING USES WE WOULD BE TALKING ABOUT WOULD BE IN THE TOURISTY PART OF THE TOWN BUT SOME OF THEM MAY NOT BE BECAUSE THE LEGALLY -- THE ONES WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ARE SINGLE FAMILY HOMES THAT PEOPLE ARE USING AS STRs SO SOME OF THOSE ARE PROBABLY IN OUR DOWNTOWN AREA, BUT SOME ARE PROBABLY NEIGHBORHOODS. WE HAD PEOPLE CALL AND TALK ABOUT THAT. THEY MAYBE DRIVING FACTORS. BUT THAT BECAUSE THERE IS CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY AROUND THAT, WHAT I WANT TO EMPHASIZE WAS THAT I INVITE YOU TO URGE THAT CONVERSATION ON COUNCIL URGE US TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION, ABOUT THE USE ABOUT ALLOWING SORRY NON-PRINCIPLE RESIDENTS STRs IN MIXED USE ZONES. BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THE ORDINANCE THAT WE HAVE PERMITS THAT. ACROSS THE BOARD WITH NO LIMITATIONS. IT MAYBE WE WANT TO EXAMINE WHETHER WE THINK THAT IS OKAY ACROSS THE BOARD ACROSS THE WHOLE CITY WHETHER WE WANT TO ESTABLISH LIMITS IN THE TOWN TOWN AREA, WHETHER WE WANT TO ESTABLISH LIMIT MS. THE TRANSIT ORIENTED ZONES THAT WHERE WE ARE GOING TO BE CREATING MORE. AND I'M NOT ADVOCATING ANY OF THESE POSITIONS BECAUSE I HAVEN'T THOUGHT THEM THROUGH YET. BUT I THINK THERE IS A PLACE WHERE YOU HAVE NOT HAD A FULL EXAMINATION THAT CAN REALLY UNFOLD THE VALUES THAT ARE AT ODDS WITH EACH OTHER. IN THIS IN THIS AREA OF REGULATION. IT IS INTERESTING TO ME. THE BIGGEST OUTCRY CAME OVER THE USE OF SINGLE FAMILY HOMES IN SINGLE FAMILY ZONES. AS NON-PRINCIPLE RESIDENTS STRs.
02:00:42.022: >> COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN. SO M LENART COUP OF QUESTIONS FOR YOU SO WHY DIDHIS COME TO PLANNING MMISSIONOW? RSUS THE AMEING CHAPTERS 9 ANCALLING IT GD WHY ISHE COISSION BEINGEING ASKEDO CONSIDER TS NOW WHEN CONSIDER THIWE NOTSKED TO IT DSN'T QUITE MAK SENSE T ME
02:01:13.787: >>ECSEOW TIRECTI FROM THEECEMBE RESOLUTION OF CITY COUIL SEEMS WHOLLY APPROPRIATE TO APPLY AN EXISTING, REGULATORY FRAMEWORK OF NON-CONFORMING STATUS. TO ACHIEF AN OUTCOME COUNCIL ASKED STAFF AND THE -- IF APPLICABLE THE PLANNING COMMISSION TO CONSIDER. STAFF THINKS THAT SORT OF TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THAT EXISTING REGULATORY FRAMEWORK WITH THE LEGACY AND APPROPRIATENESS OF IT IS AN APPROPRIATE WAY TO DO THAT AND BY COURSE WE PRESENTED TO YOU BEFORE WE PRESENT TO THE CITY COUNCIL.
02:01:53.860: >> SO WHY WASN'T THIS PRESENTED TO PLANNING COMMISSION PREVIOUSLY? BEFORE IT WAS AMENDED IN CHAPTER 97? STILL HAVING A HARD TIME UNDERSTANDING LIKE WHY ARE WE BEING QUOTE UNQUOTE TAGGED INTO THIS NOW AND WE WEREN'T PREVIOUSLY.
02:02:10.076: >> JUST I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING MORE ELOQUENT AT THE TIME STAFF AND CITY THOUGHT A LICENSING ORDINANCE WAS THE APPROPRIATE WAY TO DO THIS. I THINK THAT WAS I THINK THAT WAS STARTING WITH AN APPROACH SIMILAR TO THE RENTAL, SORT OF VACATION PROGRAM, IT WAS CREATING PERHAPS SORT OF A NEW CATEGORY IF YOU WILL OF RENTAL OR SUBCATEGORY OF RENTAL. SO REGULATING THAT IN A SIMILAR WAY WHERE FROM ZONING PERSPECTIVE, RENTAL WOULD BE A RENTAL. REGARDLESS OF IT BEING SHORT OR LONG TERM. SO I THINK THAT'S THE REGULATORY PROCESS THAT STARTED AND RESULTED WITH CHAPTER 97 BEING ADOPTN'TED WITHOUT PLANNING COMMISSION WITH YOU OR ANY CONSIDERATION OF ZONING. ULTIMATELY COUNCIL HAS ASKED AGAIN TO ACHIEVE A RESULT. THEY WEREN'T SPECIFIC TO SAY IT SHOULD BE DONE IN CHAPTER 55. BUT TO ACHIEVE RESULT FROM STAFF PERSPECTIVE WE THOUGHT THIS WAS A WHOLLY APPROPRIATE WAY TO ACCOMPLISH THAT. TO ACTUALLY TAKE IT BRING THOSE USES INTO THE UDC, AND USE NON-CONFORMING STATUS AS WAY TO ACHIEVE COUNCIL QUESTION.
02:03:30.724: >> I'M HAVING A HARD TIME DOING WHAT COUNCIL IS ASKING US TO DO BECAUSE WE ARE ASKING TO AMEND THE UDC. BUT WE ARE NOT REALLY LOOKING AT THIS FROM ALL ANGLES. WE ARE BEING TOLD HERE IS WHAT CHAPTER 97 HAS IN IT. GO AHEAD AND PUT IT INTO THE UDC BUT WE ARE -- I'M HAVING A REALLY HARD TIME MAKING THIS DECISION OF LET'S DO EXACTLY WHAT COUNCIL HAS ASKED US TO DO. WHEN THERE MAYBE OTHER ASPECTS WE NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. SO I'M STRUGGLING WITH THAT. TO MY FELLOW COMMISSIONERS I'M STRUGGLING WITHOUT REALLY LOOKING AT IT, DO WE REALLY WANT THIS IN THE OFFICE DISTRICT. DO WE REALLY WANT THIS IN THE RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS? DO WE PUT AN R 2 NOT R 4 SOMETHING OF THAT NATURE. WE HAVEN'T HAD A TRUE DISCUSSION ON THIS. SO I HAVE A HARD TIME VOTING ON THIS WITHOUT A LOOK AT THE BIG PICTURE. THE OTHER ASPECT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS, TAKE FOR EXAMPLE JEFFERSON MARKET. JEFF JEFFERSON MARKET IS A RETAIL OPERATION THAT IS OPERATING IN R 2A ZONING DISTRICT. IF THAT BUILDING WERE TO SELL TODAY, TO ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL THEY ARE GRANDFATHERED IN TO CONTINUING THAT RETAIL OPERATION. IS THAT CORRECT, MR. LENART?
02:05:11.591: >> THAT'S CORRECT.
02:05:14.494: >> OKAY. IF THEY WERE SO WHEN DO THEY LOSE THEIR OPPORTUNITY TO OPERATE AS A RETAIL ESTABLISHMENT? IS THAT 12 MONTH PERIOD, IS THAT THE SAME WE ARE PROPOTESSING FOR THE SHORT TERM RENTALS?
02:05:24.037: >> THAT 12 MONTH PERIOD IS A -- THAT IS A SPECIFICATION OF NON-CONFORMING ORDINANCE BUT NOT SPECIFIC TO CIRCUMSTANCE YOU DESCRIBED OR TO SHORT TERM RENTALS THAT IS A MEASUREMENT OF TIME FOR ANY NON-CONFORMING USE LOSING ITS STATUS. T SO IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE, IF IT WERE PURCHASED AND CONVERTED TO A DUPLEX THEN IT WAS OPERATED AS DUPLEX FOR A YEAR, IT CANNOT GO BACK TO RETAIL USE. PRESUMING THERE WASN'T ANYTHING ELSE LIKE PUD ZONING DISTRICT.
02:06:03.510: >> SO I WOULD PERSONALLY BE IN FAVOR OF CONTINUING THAT. SO IF THIS DOES MOVE ON TO CITY COUNCIL I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT CONTINUE. , I KNOW THERE'S DISCUSSION AROUND THAT BUT I FEEL LIKE WE HAVE A SET PRECEDENT HERE WITH ZONING AND WHAT IS CURRENTLY ALLOWED. THAT THE NEXT PROPERTY THEY ARE ALLOWED TO DO THE SAME. SO STILL CONFLICTED ABOUT VOTING ON THIS WITHOUT HAVING A FULL DISCUSSION WITH REGARDS TO SHORT TERM RENTALS. BUT THANK YOU.
02:06:40.513: >> COMMISSIONER SUAVE THEN COMMISSIONER LEE.
02:06:44.651: >> A CLARIFYING QUESTION ABOUT IT'S PREVIOUS LEGAL STATUS. AND MAYBE IT IS TOO THAT THEY WERE OPERATING AS RENTALS IS THE BY RATE DEFINITION HOW THESE WERE ASSUMED AS LEGAL, THAT'S CORRECT?
02:07:03.303: >> SO WE DON'T HAVE A DISTINCTION IN THE UDC OF RENTAL OR OWNER WE HAVE DWELLING UNITS. WE ALSO HAVE A PROVISION THAT SAYS IF NOT EXPLICITLY LISTED IN THE CODE IT IS NOT PERMITTED. SO THOSE USES WOULD LIKELY FALL SOMEWHERE IN THAT RANGE. THEY ARE EITHER NOT THEIR USES THAT ARE DISTINCT FROM DWELLING UNITS AND THEREFORE THEY ARE NOT PERMISSIBLE. OR THEY ARE RENTAL UNITS THAT HAVE A DIFFERENT RENTAL TERM THAN OTHER RENTAL UNITS. I WOULD CONTEST AS I STATED BEFORE AND I KNOW THAT ALL COMMISSIONERS DON'T AGREE, I TEND TO THINK OF THEM AS MORE COMMERCIAL USES. I THINK THEIR RELATIONSHIP IS DIFFERENT THAN A LONG TERM TENANT OF THAT SAME SPACE. BUT -- SO --
02:08:01.294: >> WOULD YOUR INTERPRETATION
02:08:03.796: >> MY INTERPRETATION WOULD BE THAT THEY WERE NOT (OVERLAPPING SPEAKERS)
02:08:09.002: >> THEY ARE NOT PERMITTED BECAUSE THE CODE DOESN'T ALLOW THEM.
02:08:12.538: >> OKAY. AND AN ALTERNATIVE ASSESSMENT IS THEY WERE DWELLING UNITS BECAUSE RENTAL PREVIOUS TO ALL THIS DID NOT HAVE A TERM DESIGNATION SO YOU COULD DWELL THERE A DAY OR FOR A YEAR, DWELLING WAS THE ONLY TERMINOLOGY CURRENTLY IN OUR ORDINANCE. IT WAS TRYING TO TRACK. --
02:08:33.059: >> THAT IS A GREAT SUMMARY.
02:08:34.227: >> OKAY. SO LIKE ONE OF THE QUESTIONS LIKE PRESUMPTIONS IS IF IT IS NOT IN OUR ORDINANCE IT IS NOT ALLOWED. AND THEN MY QUESTION IS, IF WE DON'T PROVIDE THIS, WHAT HAPPENS TO THOSE NON-CONFORMING IF THEY DON'T HAVE THIS IN THE ORDINANCE. BECAUSE IF IT IS NOT IN THE ORDINANCE NOT ALLOWED NOW WE HAVE NOTHING CLARIFYING THIS LIMBO.
02:09:06.592: >> THERE WOULD BE NO REGULATION IN THE UDC, IT WOULD STRICTLY BE REGULATEED FROM A BUSINESS LICENSING PERSPECTIVE UNDER CHAPTER 97 WHICH SAYS WHAT TYPES OF SHORT TERM RENTALS CAN OPERATE IN WHICH LOCATION. ANYONE'S AS LONG AS THAT OPERATION MET THAT ORDINANCE THEY WOULD RECEIVE A LICENSE. ANY THAT DID NOT WOULD NOT BE ELIGIBLE FOR A LICENSE AND WOULD BE IN VIOLATION OF CHAPTER 97.
02:09:32.552: >> WHICH REMOVE IT FROM ANY RESIDENTIAL ZONING DISTRICTS
02:09:39.459: >> IF A NON-PRINCIPLE RESIDENCE.
02:09:42.528: >> HE CAN O. I WANT TO CLARIFY THOSE LINES THAT'S HELPFUL. JUST TO SOME OF THE COMMENTERS TOO, HAS STAFF BEEN OVERWHELMED BY COMPLAINTS OF CURRENT RENTALS? OVERALL? I KNOW THERE'S CONCERNS ABOUT ENFORCEMENT.
02:09:59.712: >> WE HAVE NOT. HOWEVER COMMUNITY STANDARDS POLICE DEPARTMENT IS MORE WHAT I WOULD SAY NUISANCE ORDINANCE ENFORCEMENT. I DON'T HAVE THE RECORDS BUT I AM NOT AWARE OF THE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF COMPLAINTS OVER THE PAST NINE MONTHS TO A YEAR.
02:10:19.232: >> I GUESS THAT GOES PART OF MY FILTER JUST KIND OF SHARE THIS WITH THE COMMISSION, IS UNDERSTANDING THAT WE ARE TALKING A THOUSAND OR SO AND ITS IMPACT NOT THE ENTIRE SHORT TERM RENTALS ORDINANCE AND HOW MANY MORE MIGHT COME ONLINE IN THOSE AREAS, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE GRANDFATHERED QUANTITY RELATIVE TO OUR EVALUATION CURRENTLY. SO I GUESS THAT GOES TO A LOT OF THE CALLERS AND THEIR CONCERNS AND THERE'S A BUNDLE HERE YES LOOKING AT AND THERE'S THE LARGER ORDINANTS AND THOSE TWO IMPACTS SCALES. I THINK IT GOES TO THE POINT GETTING AHEAD OF MYSELF WITH ADU BUT THERE WAS STATISTICS INTO THE STAFF REPORT ABOUT HOW MANY UNITS WERE HOMESTEADED. IN EACH OF THOSE CATEGORIES. IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO SEE BECAUSE THIS MIGHT COME BACK. WE MIGHT BRING UP SHORT TERM RENTALS AS AN ORDINANCE CHANGE IN POLICY IN THE FUTURE. SO WE -- LIKE THIS HAS COME DOWN FROM COUNCIL BUT WE MIGHT ACTUALLY REACT IN A FUTURE ORDINANCE AS WELL. ONE OF THOSE STATISTICS I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN IS LIKE HAVE WE SEEN DRAMATIC SHIFT IN HOMESTEADED PROPERTIES TO RENTAL PROPERTIES OR INCREASE OF RENTAL APPLICATIONS OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS SINCE SHORT TERM RENTALS HAVE BECOME PART OF THE MARKET. I DON'T KNOW HOW WE MIGHT LOOK AT LIKE IF THERE IS A LINEAR CURVE OF RENTAL APPLICATIONS. AND IT HAS A HUGE SPIKE MANY THE LAST FIVE YEARS OR NOT, THOSE MIGHT  WAYS WE START TO SEE SOME REACTION TO MARKET BY SORT OF AMENITY BEING AVAILABLE. I WANT TO CALL OUT TO COMMISSIONER CLARKE WITH YOUR EXPERIENCE IN THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING SECTOR AND THAT YOU HAVEN'T SEEN A COMPLETE MARKET SHIFT WAVE BECAUSE OF THIS IN OUR CITY, THAT REALLY HAS HELPED, AT LEAST MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS ISN'T THE INFLUX, IT COULD BE BUT WE ARE TAKING ACTION AT EARLIER POINT WHICH IS HELPFUL SO I APPRECIATE YOUR E PER TEASE ON THAT TOO. TO WEIGH IN. THOSE ARE MY ESTIONS. -- EXPERTISE.
02:12:38.938: >> YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO --
02:12:40.039: >> ONE QUICK THING IN RESPONSE. THAT IS THAT I CAN -- I PERSONALLY KNOW SIX OR SEVEN PEOPLE THAT HAVE THESE. NOBODY HAS REGISTERED WITH UD, C.
02:12:58.224: >> NOBODY HAS TO YET.
02:13:00.193: >> I GET IT BUT I D'T KNOW THAT THEY WILL SO I DON'T KN THAT WE HAVE LIKE -- I'M SAYING THEY ARE NOT PARTICIPATING IN THE RTAL INSPECTION PROGRAM. YEAH.
02:13:11.403: >> SO SO OF THE DATA YOU ARE ASKING FOR COMMISSIONER AVE I DON'T THINK IT WOULD NECESSALY TELLHE WHOLE STORY. BECAUSE THERES AOT OF PPLE AT RENT FOR JU A FEW WEENDS OR AEW WHATEVER AND THEY A NOT GETTING TIR HOUSE -- SO WE DON'T REALLY -- THERE IS A LOT OF THE THA FLY UND THE RADAR IN TER OF OFFICL DATAE CANATHER I TER O E GENEL CATORY OF THIS STUF THE MMERCIAL ONES THAT ARE YING THEM AND THAT THE -- THAT IS A DIFFERENT STORY, BUT IN TERMS OF AFFECTING AFFORDABILITY IN A LARGER WAY WE CAN'T TOTALLY KNOW THAT. BECAUSE I THINK THOSE OTHER ONES AFFECT IT TOO, NOT JUST COMMERCIALLY OWNED ONES SO IT IS DIFFICULT TO BE ABLE TO GET AT -- I DON'T KNOW THAT WE CAN FIND THE DATA BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY PEOPLE THAT FLY UNDER THE RADAR WITH THIS STUFF. THAT'S MY ONLY --
02:14:02.388: >> THEY WILL STILL FLY UNDER THE RADAR WITH OR WITHOUT THE THIRD DEGREE ORDINANCE.
02:14:07.760: >> THEY WILL BE OPERATING ILLEGALLY IF THEY DON'T COMPLY AND THIS IS ASKING THOSE WHO HAVE TO REGISTER, EVERYBODY ELSE IF THEY ARE ACTING ILLEGALLY, BEFORE OR AFTER, THAT DATA WON'T IMPACT THIS POLICY. WE HAVE TO THINK POLICY REGULATION. SO I HAVE TO DISMISS ANY OF THOSE ILLEGAL ONES
02:14:28.948: >> BUT IN TERMS OF POLICY EFFECTS, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN, IF YOU ARE ASKING SORT OF LARGER EFFECT OF THIS, I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF THERE'S GOING FOR MORE PEOPLE RECORDING THINGS AFTER THIS. I DON'T KNOW, WHO KNOWS. IT IS TRICKY BECAUSE SO MUCH IS NOT ABOVEBOARD IN TERMS OF AFFORDABILITY, THINGS LIKE THAT.
02:14:54.907: >> I HAVE COMMISSIONER LEE, COMMISSIONER CLARKE YOU HAD YOUR HAND UP THEN DOWN AND THEN BACK UP SO I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU BEFORE COMMISSIONER ABRONS IF THAT IS OKAY. COMMISSIONER ABRONS, OKAY. SO LEE CLARKE ABRONS. I MISSED COMMISSIONER CLARKE.
02:15:11.657: >> COMMISSIONER CLARKE IF IT'S DIRECTLY IN RESPONSE I CAN YIELD MY TIME.
02:15:17.563: >> IF ANYONE -- EVERYBODY HAS SEEN IT THERE'S AN ARTICLE WASHINGTON BOTH COUPLE OF DAYS AGO ANN ARBOR MENTIONED AFFORDABLE HOUSEK, REALLY GOOD. I THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING A MAN IN KALLIMA ZOO FEATURED IN IT AND HE'S MENTIONED RENTING WEEK BY WEEK FROM A LANDLORD IN A SIMILAR SITUATION. OBVIOUSLY COMPLETELY DIFFERENT CONTEXT BUT IN THE FUTURE SHORT TERM RENTAL I THINK WE CAN BE CAREFUL NOT TO MIX UP THE PLATFORM PEOPLE ARE RENTING OFF OF VERSUS THE IDEA ITSELF OF LIKE RENTING DURING SHORT DURATION BECAUSE THAT'S ALL YOU CAN AFFORD AT THE TIME.
02:15:55.634: >> GREAT. COMMISSIONER LEE. THEN COMMISSIONER ABRONS.
02:16:00.139: >> THANK YOU. I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE ARE SCOPING CORRECTLY. I HEARD MR. LENART SAY COUNCIL DID GIVE A NARROW TASK. I WANT TALK PRACTICALLY, IF WE PUNT TODAY IF WE SAY YES GOING TO POSTPONE I WANT TO UNDERSTAND IF I OWN AD SINGLE FAMILY REST TENIAL HOME IN A RESIDENTIAL ZONE NOT MIXED USE, I WAS USING IT AS AIR B AND B WHAT HAPPENS, LIKE IF WE PUNT THIS, PRACTICALLY, IS IT CAN I JUST NO LONGER USE IT ON AIR B AND B? I HAVE GOT THIS ENTIRE HOUSE FOR THE RECORD I DON'T HAVE ONE, SO I WANT TO UNDERSTAND PRACTICALLY, WE PUNT THIS, AND WE DON'T ADDRESS THE GRANDFATHER ONES THAT WOULD BE IN A NON-CONFORMING STATUS THEY WILL HAVE HOMES THAT JUST -- THEY JUST CAN'T -- THEY ARE LIKE OH SHOOT I GOT TO FIND A TENANT FOR 30 DAYS OR I JUST CAN'T --
02:16:55.628: >> SO UNDER ORDINANCE AS OF MARCH 1, IT WOULD BE ILLEGAL SHORT TERM RENTAL BECAUSE IT WAS NOT LICENSED BY CHAPTER 97 AND IT WOULDN'T BE ELIGIBLE FOR LICENSE UNDER CHAPTER 97.
02:17:12.611: >> GOT IT.
02:17:13.746: >> I WOULD ANTICIPATE THERE IS GOING TO BE SOME TRANSITION PERIOD THE CITY IS NOT GOING TO BE ENFORCING THAT UNTIL A CONCLUSION IS MADE IN SOME RESPONSE TO THE DECEMBER RESOLUTION BY CITY COUNCIL. HOWEVER, I DON'T -- THAT IS NOT MY POLICY DECISION TO MAKE. I THINK THAT THERE IS AN INTENTION TO BE RESPECTFUL OF THIS DIRECTION THAT COUNCIL ASKS THE CITY STAFF TO PURSUE AND GETTING COMMISSIONED BY THIS PROXY. BUT SO THE SHORT ANSWER IS IT'S COMPLICATED. IT WOULD BE ILLEGAL, I DON'T ANTICIPATE THE CITY IS GOING TO BE WRITING ENFORCEMENT LETTERS ON MARCH AFTER THIS MEETING IF IT'S POSTPONED. BUT AT SOME POINT THERE WOULD BE A POLICY DECISION THAT IT -- THIS CHANGE HAS NOT BEEN MADE. THERE IS NO ACCOMMODATION FOR THESE REGULATIONS TO BE PROSPECTIVE INSTEAD OF APPLYING BROADLY. AND THEN AT SOME POINT ENFORCEMENT WOULD HAPPEN. ON THE FLIP SIDE SOME RESPONSE HAPPENS THAN PROVIDES AN AVENUE FOR YOUR PROPERTY TO BE LIE SENTENCED UNDER SOME CIRCUMSTANCES. SO PRACTICALLY I THINK FRANKLY WHETHER YOU TAKE ACTION ON IT TONIGHT OR DON'T, PROBABLY DOESN'T MATTER. PRACTICALLY. BUT I CAN'T PREDICT HOW LONG THAT WINDOW IS. AND IT'S A MATTER OF ADMINISTRATIVE DECISION TO START IN ENFORCEMENT.
02:18:54.747: >> GOT YOU. I APPRECIATE THE CLARIFICATION. BY THE WAY WHILE WE WERE HAVING THIS DISCUSSION, I DID JUST LOOK ON AIR B AND B. FOR MY OWN EDIFICATION, I NEVER LOOKED IN ANN ARBOR EVER. I LOOKED IN DIFFERENT CITIES BEFORE, I SAW 88 AVAILABLE NEXT WEEK WEDNESDAY SO THAT JUST IS -- EVEN IF YOU ARE NOT REGISTERING WITH THE CITY I IMAGINE YOU ARE PROBABLY ADVERTISING IT. BECAUSE THAT'S HUE YOU MAKE YOUR REVENUE. SO I WANTED TO MAKE THAT POINT OF CLARIFICATION. SURE THERE'S MORE AND SOMETIMES NOT AVAILABLE OR THEY ARE BOOKED UP BUT NEEDED TO GET A SENSE OF SCALE FROM MY OWN SENSE. THERE IS A LOT HERE AND I KNOW WE HAVE A TON OF DISCUSSION. SO I WANT TO BE RESPECTFUL OF EVERYONE'S TIME SO I WILL TRY TO WRAP IT UP QUICKLY. I -- WOULD IT BE FAIR MR. LENART TO SAY THIS REQUEST FROM COUNCIL IS COMING BECAUSE FOR A SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENTIAL OWNER THAT'S NOT PRINCIPLE RESIDENT, THAT OWNS AIR B AND B THEY FEEL THAT IT MIGHT NOT FEEL FAIR IF THEY WERE OPERATING LEGALLY UNTIL THIS WAS ENACTED AND THERE IS NO MECHANISM FOR GRANDFATHER, MEASURE OF TRYING TO SAY ALL RIGHT, WE'VE MADE OUR DECISION AS A CITY, THAT WE WANTED TO MIX USED ZONE MOVING FORWARD BUT NONE IN RESIDENTIAL ZONES. WOULD IT BE FAIR, THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE ASKING US TO DELIBERATE ON. IS THAT AN ACCURATE CAPTURE?
02:20:25.804: >> YEAH.
02:20:28.540: >> OKAY.
02:20:31.176: >> THERE IS A TON -- I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO START. I HAVE WRITTEN DOWN SO MANY THOUGHTS ABOUT HEALTHY NEIGHBORHOODS JAY JACOBS EYES ON THE STREET, OUR ROLE TO PERMIT HEALTH WELFARE SAFETY THERE, IS A LOT FOR US TO OBVIOUSLY -- AND COMMISSIONER GIBB RANDAL YOUR DISCUSSION ABOUT A LARGER BROADER VIEW I THINK I HAVE HAD A LOT OF DISCUSSIONS ONE OFF WITH AIR B AND B OWNERS ON THIS MATTER. I THINK IT'S ALSO MERITED BECAUSE THIS IS A VERY COMPLICATED TOPIC THAT DOESN'T HAVE A QUICK ANSWER. COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR APPROACH ON SAYING MAYBE THE KIND OF CONCILIATORY APPROACH WOULD BE THE SAY THAT HAS SUNSET UPON TRANSACTION. IF YOU GRANDFATHER IN YOU TRIGGER YOU NO LONGER FIT IN THERE. WHILE I SEE COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN'S POINT OF MAINTAINING THE PROPERTY USES UPON TRANSFER. LOT OF DISCUSSION I WANT TO TO BE RESPECTFUL BUT I WANT TO CLARIFY AND SCOPE FOR US THAT BASICALLY THESE FOLKS THAT HAD SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENCE IN NEIGHBORS, IF THEY ARE OPERATING AIR B AND B AND WERE DOING SO BEFORE THIS WAS PASSED, THEY WILL NOT HAVE -- THEY WILL HAVE EMPTY HOUSES UNTIL THEY CAN BASICALLY SAY I NEED TO FIND LONG TERM TENANT. SO I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT IS WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS. AND I HOPE THAT THAT IS CLARIFICATION FOR AT LEAST TO FOR US TO BE MORE ACTIONABLE RATHER THAN THEORETICAL.
02:22:08.073: >> THANK YOU. COMMISSIONER ABRONS.
02:22:12.811: >> I WANT TO ADD TO THE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF SCENARIOS, CURIOUS, I KEEP REREADING THE CITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION, THAT IS R 2473. WHEN I LOOK AT THAT LANGUAGE IT SAYS DIRECTS THE CITY ODD MINUTE INVESTIGATOR AND PLANNING COMMISSION IF APPLICABLE TO DEVELOP AND PROPOSE AMENDMENTS TO CHAPTER 97 AND/OR CHAPTER 55 UDC. TO CREATE APPROPRIATE REGULATORY STRUCTURE ET CETERA. SO I GUESS QUESTION ONE WOULD BE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF WE DIDN'T DO THIS. LIKE IF WE VOTE NO. THIS EVENING, WHAT ARE THE NEXT STEPS WHEN WE HAVE -- WE BASICALLY DIRECTED TO CREATE THIS STRUCTURE. SO WHAT HAPPENS IF WE SAY NO IN EFFECT AND THEN WONDERING IF THERE IS THIS KIND OF AND/OR IN THE DIRECTION. I GUESS THE IMPLICATION IS IS THERE A POSSIBILITY FOR THIS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF WITHIN CHAPTER 97 OPPOSED TO WITHIN UDC.
02:23:15.040: >> IF YOU WERE TO ONE SCENARIO WOULD BE IF PLANNING COMMISSION DOES NOT RECOMMEND THESE PROPOSAL AMENDMENTS, I WOULD LIKELY I GUESS BASED ON NATURE OF YOUR DECISION, I'M GOING TO JUMP TO CONCLUSION THAT THAT WOULD BE EMPHASIZING THE AND/OR THIS SHOULD BE ADDRESSED IN CHAPTER 97 RATHER THAN CHAPTER 5. THAT RECOMMENDATION WOULD GO TO CITY COUNCIL FOR THEM TO CONSIDER WHETHER THEY AGREE. AND PURSUE CHAPTER 97 OR THEY COULD SAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR RECOMMENDATION AND CHOOSE TO ENACT CHANGES TO CHAPTER 55. REGARDLESS.
02:23:58.684: >> WITHOUT CITY COUNCIL BECAUSE WE ARE ADVISORY. SO -- SORRY WITHOUT PLANNING COMMISSION BECAUSE WE ARE ADVISORY.
02:24:04.389: >> CORRECT. SO JUST TO BE WONKY, WE ARE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE ADVICE TO THIS TOPIC HONESTY COUNCIL. CITY COUNCIL MAKES THE DECISION, THEY CAN MAKE A DIFFERENT DECISION THAN PLANNING COMMISSION I CAN THEY CAN SAME DECISION SOMETHING IN BETWEEN WHERE THEY MODIFY IT. YOUR DUTY AND MINE AS YOUR SUPPORT IS TO DELIVER THAT RECOMMENDATION IN ONE WAY OR THE OTHER TO THEM. AND THEY ARE THE FINAL ASH TORR OF THE ACTUAL DECISION AND THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE CONSISTENT -- ARBY TORR, THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE CONSISTENT OR INCONSISTENT.
02:24:39.558: >> SO WHEN I READ THE RESOLUTION IT SAYS THAT IT DIRECTS US TO PROPOSE AMENDMENTS NOT TO OFFER OPINION. I GUESS DON'T KNOW IF I -- I'M TRYING TO HOW MUCH -- THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'M ENCOUNTERING THIS MAYBE DIRECT.
02:24:55.274: >> YEAH. I THINK --
02:24:56.074: >> MANDATE IN SUCH A WAY WHERE I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE DELIBERATION AND THE ROLE OF THE THIS DELIBERATION. AND WHAT HAPPENS IF WE -- YEAH. I GUESS RESIST THE DIRECTION.
02:25:07.686: >> SO I THINK YOU ARE BEING PUT IN THIS POSITION BECAUSE THAT'S MY FAULT, MY COLLEAGUE'S FAULT WHEN IT SAYS CIT ADMINISTRATOR, THAT MEANS CITY ADMINISTRATOR TO CRAWFORD A DERRICK COMMUNITY SERVICES AINISTRATOR DOWN TO YOURS TRULY, SO IN US ANSWERING THAT WE HE CONCLUDED THAT THI ISN AROPRIATE W TO AOMPLISH THAT D IHINK IF BECAU OF THAT, YOURE BEING BUGHT INTOT AT MILSHTEYN D PERHAPS YOU FRUSTRATN, AND ACCORDING IF URDVICE ISO IT START IN APR 97 ITHOULDTAY THERE, E UDC SHODN'T PARSE THIS ANY MORE THAN IT DID PREVIOUSLY, THAT'S A PERFECTLY APPROPRIATE RECOMMENDATION TO CITY COUNCIL. YOU CAN ALSO IF I MAY SUGGEST OTHER CONSIDERATIONS THAT COUNCIL LOOKS AT THAT I DON'T HAVE TO BE ONLY ACCOMPANYING FAVORABLE RECOMMENDATION, BUT TO BE CLEAR, COUNCIL COULD FOLLOW ADVICE OR GO MANY THE DIRECTION AS WE ARE PRESENTING IT TO YOU.
02:26:25.931: >> THAT MAKES SENSE. I THINK IF IT'S A LITTLE BIT MINCING WORDS. BUT IT IS LIKE IF WHAT I'M BEING ASKED TO DO IS VOTE YES OR NO, THIS IS THE APPROPRIATE LANGUAGE TO PRODUCE REGULATORY STRUCTURE TO DO THIS THING THAT COUNCIL WANT TO DO. IT IS IN MY OPINION. T DO I THINK THAT I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING IN 97 I FEEL LIKE THAT'S A DIFFERENT QUESTION. BUT THAT IS NOT I THINK WHAT I'M BEING ASKED TO VOTE ON IN MY CAPACITY AS COMMISSIONER. BUT THAT FEELS SO MAYBE THAT FEELS MORE BLACK AND WHITE TO ME THAN SOME OF MY FELLOW COMMISSIONERS. SO MAYBE I WOULD WANT TO GO ON THE RECORD SAYING IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE USEFUL TO BE ASKED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE LARGER CONVERSATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF CHAPTER7 T I DON'T FEEL SO STRONGLY ABOUT THAT THAT I'M GOING TO FLOW UP OBSTACLES OR DENY SAY I THINK THE ATOPPINGS OF REGULATORY STRUCTURE THAT WOULD ACHIEVE WHAT COUNCIL WANTS TO ACHIEVE. BUT I HOPE THAT WHEN COUNCIL TAKES THIS UP THERE IS MAYBE MORE ROBUST CONVERSATION THAT GETS A LOT OF POINTS BROUGHT UP THIS EVENING.
02:27:42.941: >> FORTUNATE TO HAVE A COLLEAGUE AT THAT TABLE.
02:27:45.644: >> WHO HAS THEIR HAND UP. YEAH.
02:27:49.114: >> BEFORE, YES. BEFORE WE GO TO COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN AND COMMISSIONER DISCH I'M GOING TO PUT IN MY TWO CENTS WORTH HERE. WHICH IS I REALLY APPRECIATE COMMISSIONER CLARKE WHAT YOU WERE BRINGING UP TO PUT THIS IN CONTEXT. ALSO I DON'T REMEMBER NOW WHO EFFECTIVELY SAID WE ARE NOT TALKING ALL THINGS, SHORT TERM RENTALS BUT THIS IS THE NON-CONFORMING BIT WITHIN THE RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS. SO IN MY MIND THIS IS A RELATIVELY SMALL AREA THAT WE CAN ANYPLACE IN THE BUD NOW -- NIP IN THE BUD AND MOVE ON. IN MY MIND IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT HONESTLY THAT THE TABLES BE AMENDED WITHIN THE UDC TO CALL OUT SHORT TERM RENTALS IN THE DIFFERENT CLASSIFICATIONS WHICH I THINK IS INTERESTING THE WAY THEY CAME UP, I DON'T KNOW THAT I WOULD HAVE COME UP WITH THAT SAME THING TO COMMISSIONER ABRONS POINT BUT I THINK THAT SPELLING SHORT TERM RENTALS AS A USE WITHIN THE UDC IS REALLY IMPORTANT. BECAUSE IT GIVES IT A LITTLE MORE SURETY. RIGHT NOW IF YOU GO TO THE UDC AND LOOK AT THE USE TABLES LIKE WELL, DOES THIS FALL UNDER A B AND B? WHAT IS THIS? SO I THIS I THAT IS FUNDAMENTAL. I THINK ALL A LOT OF WHAT WE ARE TALKING AROUND HERE IS ABOUT THE NON-CONFORMING LEGAL NON-CONFORMING STATUS. OR AT LEAST I THINK THAT'S A GOOD PART. FOR THE -- IDEA AT HAND AND WHAT COMMISSIONER DISCH SAID EARLIER ABOUT LIKE HEY, IF WE WANT TO DO SOMETHING ELSE IF WE SEE A DIFFERENT ROLE FOR THIS, LIKE THAT'S WITHIN OUR PURVIEW BUT I WOULD ALSO SAY THIS IS NOT ON THE TOP OF MY LIST OF THINGS TO ADDRESS. WE HAVE GOT WAY BIGGER FISH TO FRY AS PLANNING COMMISSION. THAT'S ON OUR WORK PLAN PERSONALLY. SO THIS IS NOT EVEN IF I LIKE TO LIKE MOVE ON FROM THIS. I'M OKAY WITH AS THIS IS I THINK IT'S FOLLOWING SOMETHING WE ALREADY HAD AND I I THINK ET ICE REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE AMEND THOSE TABLES TO CALL THIS OUT. AS A LAND USE SO PEOPLE KNOW WHERE IT'S ALLOWED. AND WHERE IT'S NOT. THAT'S MY TWO CENTS. COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN AND COMMISSIONER DISCH. YOU CAN ADD.
02:30:09.221: >> SO THE MORE WE TALK ABOUT IT, THE MORE I AM GROWING FRUSTRATED. BECAUSE WE ARE BEING ASKED TO COME IN AT THE LAST MINUTE AND SORT OF FIX WHAT COUNCIL DID. SO WITH THAT SAID, I PLAN TO VOTE NO ON THIS AND MY REASON FOR VOTING KNOW IS BECAUSE WE DIDN'T LOOK AT THE WHOLE PICTURE HERE. WE ARE LOOKING AT THIS LITTLE TINY PICTURE AT THIS POINT. FROM IS MORE TO THIS. I THINK THERE IS MORE TO THIS DISCUSSION. I THINK THERE'S MORE PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN. AND THAT IS THE REASON I'M GOING TO VOTE NO, NOT BECAUSE I DISAGREE WITH WHAT IS BEFORE US. I JUST FEEL LIKE THE PROCESS THAT I WENT THROUGH IS NOT THE RIGHT PROCESS. AND SO THAT'S THE REASON FOR MY NO VOTE THIS EVENING.
02:30:58.336: >> THANK YOU COMMISSIONER DISCH.
02:31:05.777: >> I DON'T WANT TO MANY GO ELABORATE TOO MUCH ABOUT THIS BUT RECALL THAT THIS WAS PAST SEPTEMBER AND I WAS WATCHING THIS TASK. AND I -- IT WAS A REALLY LONG RUN WAY FOR IMPLEMENTATION, WE'RE GOING TO IMPLEMENT IN MARCH BECAUSE EVEN IF THE DISCUSSION WITH THE COUNCIL TABLE, THEY WERE RAISING MONEY ABOUT THIS AND THAT. THERE WAS EXTENSIVE DISCUSSION AND PEOPLE THEY EVEN SAID EXPLICITLY THAT NIGHT THAT THERE'S STUFF THAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED BEFORE THIS ACTUALLY COMES INTO -- SO WE ARE GOING TO PASS IT BUT WE EXPECT TWEAKING TO HAPPEN AND WE ARE OKAY WITH THAT. I KNOW IT'S WEIRD. YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ARE BEING ASKED TO FIX. I THINK -- I DON'T KNOW, FIX IS THE RIGHT WORD OR WEIGH IN AND NOT GET TO START FROM SCRATCH, RENOVATE A HOUSE. BUT PUT BATHROOM ON THE ROOF YOU THINK THAT IS A BAD IDEA. I DON'T KNOW. WHATEVER IT IS. BUT IT IS A WEIRD -- IT IS A LITTLE BIT UNUSUAL. I GUESS. BUT I REALLY APPRECIATE WHAT COUNCIL MEMBER -- APPRECIATE WHAT EVERYBODY SAID AND APPRECIATE THE COMPLEXITY OF THE ISSUE BUT I ALSO APPRECIATE THAT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO DEFINE THIS LAND USE BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IT DOESN'T EXIST. AND IT'S HAPPENING BUT IT DOESN'T EXIST IN A LEGAL WAY. IT DOESN'T HAVE A LEGAL DEFINITION IN THE UDC. I THINK THAT IS SUPER IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER AND YOU HAVE THE POWER TO DO THAT AND IT WOULD BE MOST HELPFUL IF YOU WOULD EXERCISE THAT POWER. BUT IF YOU REALLY DON'T WANT TO IT CAN WORK OUT AND I DO AGREE THAT THERE ARE THINGS THAT VICE PRESIDENT A PARTICULAR CONSEQUENTIAL IMPACT THAN THIS WILL ON THE GOALS OF AFFORDABILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY. IT WOULD BE GREAT IF THIS DIDN'T GET LINGERED OVER TOO LONG BASICALLY.
02:32:58.156: >> COMMISSIONER LEE I SAW YOUR HAND.
02:33:01.259: >> I WANTED TO SAY I AGREE COMMISSIONER DISCH. I PLAN TO VOTE YES BECAUSE I THINK IF I WAS IN THE POSITION OF A HOMEOWNER WHO HAD ONE OF THESE AND TO BE BASICALLY SAY SAYING -- SHOOT, I'M DOING SOMETHING ILLEGAL NOW WE NEED TO MAKE PROVISIONS AND WE NEED TO CREATE CLASSIFICATION. I WANT TO SAY I PLAN TO VOTE ON YES ON THIS ONE.
02:33:24.582: >> ANY OTHER DISCUSSION. ALL RIGHT. COMMISSIONER GIBB RANDAL.
02:33:36.561: >> I'M STILL UP IN THE AIR BUT ONE OF THE THING THAT WOULD MAKE ME FEEL BETTER IS IN IF I KNEW THERE WOULD BE SOME PERHAPS COUNCIL PERSON DISCH COULD MAKE A PROMISE THAT SHE'S GOING TO BRING THIS -- BECAUSE THIS IS IS THE THING I THAT I FEEL LIKE IT DOESN'T FEEL ALL THE WAY THOUGHT OUT TO ME. I FEEL LIKE THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE DATA GATHERED. I DO. AND I THINK IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO KNOW HOW IT AFFECTS AFFORDABILITY. IT IS HARD TO FIGURE THAT OUT. AND WITH THE AFFORDABILITY THERE IS NO BIG ONE SLAM DUNK THING. IT IS A BUNCH OF LITTLE THINGS ALL WORKING TOGETHER. TO DO IT. AND I FEEL LIKE THIS COULD BE PART OF THAT. SO I WOULD -- I BECAUSE IT IS DEFINED IN H A NARROW WAY, I WOULD MARGINALLY VOTE YES BECAUSE I SEE ITS ROLE, BUT I ALSO FEEL LIKE THIS IS NOT FULLY BAKED. AND I REALLY LOOK FORWARD AND HOPE THAT THERE WILL BE MORE SUBSTANTIAL DISCUSSION AROUND SOME OF THESE THINGS AS IT O THE -- AS IT RELATES TO ESPECIALLY AFFORDABILITY FOR ME, THAT'S THE PIECE I THINK THAT I FEEL LIKE IS REALLY MISSING HERE. BECAUSE I MEAN, IT IS TIED TO SUPPLY. THERE'S JUST NO WAY AROUND THAT. AND I THINK THAT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT RIGHT SIZE IS AND IT ISN'T NECESSARILY OUR ROLE HERE BUT I JUST WOULD WILLING TO VOTE FOR IT IF THAT WOULD GET TRANSLATED INTO THE NEXT ITERATION FOR CITY COUNCIL.
02:35:17.695: >> SEEING A NOD. T COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT. QUICKLY TAGGING TO THAT. I AM A LITTLE TORN BETWEEN THIS 55 AND USE TRANSFER THEY MAYBE DID IN 97 LIKE USE TRANSFER I UNDERSTAND WHAT WE ARE VOTING ON TODAY. I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT CONVERSATION ACCEPTED AGAIN BUT BEFORE ASKING COUNCIL MEMBER DISCH TO BRING MORE STUFF UP AT COUNCIL I WOULD BE INTERESTED COUNCIL HAVING A DISCUSSION ON THAT AS WELL. BECAUSE IT SOUNDED LIKE THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THEIR ORIGINAL SPENT TO LIKE NOT HAVE THE USE NECESSARILY TRANSFERRED WITHIN THE PROPERTIES SO JUST POSSIBLY BRINGING UP TO, FOR MORE DISCUSSION AT THIS POINT TOO. I THINK MAKES SENSE. FOR REASONS I THINK COMMISSIONER THAT YOU STATE AND JEFFERSON MARKET HELPS ME AS WELL, WE CAN'T JUST SORT OF PICK AND CHOOSE LIKE WE LIKE THIS USE, SO LIKE THI WILL CONTINUE AND YOU CAN SELL IT AND IT'S FINE BUT WE DON'T HAVE THE USE SO WE CAN'T DO THAT. BUT I WOULD LIKE COUNCIL TO IF POSSIBLE HAVE MORE OF THAT DISCUSSION BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT ORIGINAL INTENT WAS TO WHAT I PROBABLY ASSUME THAT YOU ARE COOLOU GRANDFATHERED FOR NOW BUT SELL IT AND IT'S DONE. HEREOR HEARING MORE DISCUSSION ON THAT WOULD HELP THE COMMUNITY ALSO.
02:36:36.274: >> TO ADD TO THAT CONVERSATION. MR. LENART WHAT HAPPENS IF THE TABLES ARE AMENDED, THE SECTION ABOUT THE NON-CONFORMING ABOUT NON-CONFORMITY IS NOT IN THERE. IS THAT FURTHER GRAY AREA? NOW?
02:36:58.229: >> IT WOULD BE FURTHER GRAY AREA AND SORRY I'M TRYING TO THINK. IT WOULD GO BACK I THINK IT WOULD GO BACK TO THE CLASSIFICATION THAT COMMISSIONER SUAVE AND I DISCUSSED, I THINK THAT WOULD PROVIDE A CLEAR ANSWER TO THOSE USES NOT BECOME LEGAL. BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T IN THE ORDINANCE OR WERE THEY DWELLING UNITS? I THINK I WOULD -- MY PERSONAL I WERE KING WOULD BE THE FORMER. I DON'T THINK THEY FUNCTION AS A DWELLING UNIT. BUT I THINK WITHOUT THE NON-COORMING PROVISION WITH THE DEFINITN YOU ARE NOT -- YOARE SORT OFOT PROVIDING A PRESSU RELEASE VALVE T THAT, QUESON.
02:38:02.460: >> SO THE OTHE WAYO WRITE T NON---HE LEGALON-CONFORMIN LIKE YOU H TO MT THESEHAT HOOPS. BRETT ASING JEFF IN ADDITION, THEY DON'T THEY WOULDN'T MEET THOSE HOOPS BUT THOSE HOOPS ARE RIGHT NOW KIND OF VAGUE, IS THAT FAIR?
02:38:25.216: >> WE ARE FROM A UDC PERSPECTIVE IT IS ESTABLISHING THAT YOU WERE DOING THIS DEFINED USE PRIOR TO THIS DATE. WE ARE NOT SAYING HOW YOU PROVE THAT, BUT YOU HAVE TO PROVE IT. AND IF YOU CAN, AND THE CITY ASSERTS AND AGREES THEN YOU HAVE PROVED IT AND THAT STATUS IS APPLIED. IF YOU CAN NOT PROVE THAT THAT IS THAT SUS IS NOT RETAINED. GOT IT
02:38:49.173: >> . PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE IT'S NOT POWER JOB GENERALLY WITHIN UDC FOR OTHER THINGS HOW WE GO ABOUT PROVING THAT. THAT IS -- INTERPRETATION, LIKE IS THAT FAIR?
02:39:01.719: >> IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME. WAS THIS A PROPERTY IS TRYING TO BE CERTIFIED AS A DUPLEX IN AN R 1 ZONE. WHAT IS HISTORY OF THAT. IS THERE ANY HISTORY THAT IT WAS ESTABLISHED BEFORE THAT RESTRICTION OF ZONING PERSPECTIVE. HAS THE CITY TAKEN ACTION ACKNOWLEDGING THAT. OF SO THAT HAPPENS ON A REGULAR BASIS IN ADMINISTERING THE CODE. BUT IT'S APPLY NON-CONFORMITY IN A MORE GENERAL WAY.
02:39:35.686: >> THANKS. THAT DOESN'T CHANGE MY THING WHICH IS I THINK WE NEED TO AMEND THE TABLE. I THINK HAVING COMMISSIONER DISCH TAKING THIS DISCUSSION ABOUT -- JUST SO YOU KNOW, WE ARE BEING CONSISTENT HOW WE ADDRESS NON-CONFORMITIES BUT WE DON'T KNOW THIS MEETS YOUR INTENT. SO AS LONG AS YOU CAN COMMUNICATE THAT TO YOUR COLLEAGUES, THAT IF SOLD TO NON-OWN OWNER OCCUPIED STRUCTURE IT CAN CONTINUE THIS WAY. I THINK THAT THAT SATISFIES MY THING, MY CONCERNS. COMMISSIONER LEE.
02:40:12.990: >> ONLY I WILL OOH HE WILL MAKE THIS BRIEF, REGARDING JANE'S EMAIL. I WANTED TO CONFIRM THAT THE LEGAL NON-CONFORMING USE APPLIES TO USE PORTION OF IT BUT IT WILL STILL HAVE TO MEET BUILDING FIRE CODES, HAVE VALID CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY, THIS IS NOT A BLANKET NON-CONFORMANCE WITH RESPECT TO FLAWLESSNESS BUT IT IS JUST NEARLY SPECIFIC TO THE USE. SO CLARITY ON THAT.
02:40:47.091: >> I THINK THIS IS YOUR INTENTION BUT I WANT TO BE CRYSTAL CLEAR. THE RENTAL CERTIFY CARIS REQUIRES WHEN RENTING PROPERTY, SO THAT IS REQUIRED WHEN THAT IS OCCURRING. IF THIS IS AN ACCESSORY TO OWNER OCCUPIED HOME WE DO NOT INSPECT YOUR HOME. THIS IS AN ACCESSORY USE TO THAT. SO UNDER THAT CIRCUMSTANCE UNDER CHAPTER 97 THAT WOULD NOT BE INSPECTED SO IF YOU ARE THE OWNER, OF YOUR HOME AND YOU LIVE THERE AND YOU ARE AVAILING YOURSELF AND REGISTERING AS SHORT TERM RENTAL HOME STAY OR WHOLE HOUSE THAT IS NOT A RENTAL PROPERTY IN THE EYES OF THIS ORDINANCE OR PROPERTY SO I DON'T THINK THAT WAS YOUR INTENTION BUT I WANT TO BE CRYSTAL CLEAR ABOUT THAT.
02:41:28.199: >> MY QUESTION WAS AIMED A T THE NON-PHYSICAL RESIDENTS.
02:41:32.536: >> THOSE HAVE TO BE INSPECTD ON A REGULAR ROUTINE BASIS.
02:41:36.340: >> I JUST THINK JANE BROUGHT UP A GOOD POINT WANTED TO MAKE SURE IT WAS ADDRESSED. THANK YOU.
02:41:46.717: >> ROLECAL VOTE, PEOPLE READY? MR. LENART PLEASE.
02:41:52.356: >> COMMISSIONER SUAVE START US OFF.
02:41:56.027: >> YES.
02:41:58.062: >> COMMISSIONER ABRONS.

02:42:01.399: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT.
02:42:03.134: >> YES.
02:42:05.202: >> COMMISSIONER DISCH.

02:42:18.049: >> COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN.
02:42:19.684: >> NO.
02:42:21.185: >> COMMISSIONER GIBB RANDAL.
02:42:23.754: >> YES.
02:42:25.923: >> MOTION CARRIEDS.
02:42:28.492: >> ALL RIGHT FOLKS IT IS 9:45. I NEED TO STRETCH. I IMAGINE YOU DO TOO. LET'S TAKE TEN MINUTES. TO STRETCH AND GET A GLASS OF WATER, FOR COMING BACK IF YOU ARE FOLLOWING ALONG WITH US, WHEN WE COME BACK WE WILL BE TALKING ABOUT ACCESSORY WELLING UNITS. STANDARDS.
02:42:47.511: >> AT 9:55.
02:42:48.646: >> 9:55.
02:53:42.399: >> WE ARE ON TO ITEM 9B WHICH IS PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE ACCESSORY WELLING UNITS STANDARDS IN CHAPTER 55. SO ONCE MR. LENART GIVES THE PRESENTATION WE WILL TAKE SOME CLARIFICATION QUESTIONS. TON CLEAR BEFORE WE TAKE THE CALLS.
02:54:10.260: >> THANK YOU. HAPPY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE DISCUSSION. I'M GOING TO LEAVE IT TO CITY PLANNER CHRIS CHENG WHO IS GOING TO WALK YOU THROUGH A SET OF PROPOSED CHANGES TO THE UDC. SOME OF I'LL JUST SET THE STAGE AS REMINDER THE PLANNING COMMISSION SET CONSIDERATION OF THESE SET OF AMENDMENTS TO ACCESSORY BILLING UNITS AS PART OF YOUR WORK PLAN. SO WHAT CHRIS IS GOING TO PRESENT IS SORT OF A COMPLY RATION OF PROPOSED CHANGES PREVIOUSLY DOES CUSSED BY THE PLANNING COMMISSION AND AFFORDED TO CITY COUNCIL BUT NOT ENACTED AS WELL AS SOME ADDITIONAL PROPOSED CHANGES BOTH ON THE WORKING SESSION FEBRUARY 9 AND ORDINANCE REVISION COMMITTEE MEETING OF FEBRUARY 23RD. IF I HAVE THAT DATE RIGHT. WITH THAT I'LL LEAVE IT TO CHRIS.
02:55:08.885: >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I THINK BRETT DID A GOOD JOB OVERING WE TOOK IT TO THE FEBRUARY 9 WORKING SESSION MEETING THEN THE RECENT ONE WHICH WAS FEBRUARY 23RD OUR ORDINANCE REVISION COMMITTEE MEETING. AND FROM THAT MEETING JUST AS REFRESHER FOR THE MEMBERS OF THE ORC AND MEMBERS AT HOME, WE DID STRIKE OUT THAT THE OWNER SHALL OCCUPY THE ADU OR SINGLE FAMILY DWELLING ON THE PROPERTY. ACCEPT FOR TEMPORARY ABSENCE NOT TO EXCEED COMBINED TOTAL OF SIX MONTHS IN CALENDAR YEAR, WE ALSO STRUCK OUT A DEED RESTRICTION THAT RUNS WITH THE LAND ON A FORM TO BE PROVIDED BY CITY SHALL BE PILED WITH REGISTERED DEEDS PRIOR TO OCCUPANCY AND SHALL INCORPORATE THE FOLLOWING RESTRICTION, THE ADU MAY NOT BE SOLE SEPARATELY FROM SINGLE FAMILY DWELLING OWNER OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENT OF SECTION 5.16. D .2 AND DEED RESTRICTION SHALL BE IN EFFECT I WILL THE A,DU IS REMOVED. AND WE ALSO FROM THAT MEETING DECIDED TO STRIKE AT LEAST ONE OFF STREET PARKING SPACE SHALL BE PROVIDED FOR THE ADU UNLESS PROPERTY WITHIN A QUARTER MILE OF BUS STOP THEN ADDITIONAL PARKING SPACE REQUIRED, TANDEM PARKING IN DRIVEWAY MAY -- NOT LOCATED IN FRONT YARD SET BACK UPON RESEARCH JUST ABOUT EVERY HOME IN THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR WITHIN A QUARTER MILE HAS TANDEM PARKING. THIS AGAIN REFRESH THE MEMBERS WHAT WE ARE SEEKING IS TO ADD ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT AND ALL RESIDENTIAL ZONING DISTRICTS INCLUDING OUR ONE TWO THREE FOUR BUT NOT R 6 MOBILE PARK DISTRICT. WE MADE CHANGES IN STAFF REPORT IN FORMAT BUT MINIMUM FOR REQUIREMENTS FOR ADU IS WE PREVIOUSLY HAD IT IF IT WAS UNDER 5,000 SQUARE FEET IT WASN'T ELIGIBLE. SO THIS CHART IS SHOWING THAT IT'S LESS THAN 7200 SQUARE FEET, YOU CAN BUILD UP TO A 600 SQUARE FEET ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT IF OVER THAT 7200 SQUARE FEET YOU CAN BUILD 800 SQUARE FOOT ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT. AGAIN THIS WAS MORE FOR CLARIFICATION ADU SHOULDN'T BE OCCUPIED BY MORE THAN NUMBER O OKAY PANTS BY SECTION 5.161A. SEPTEMBER THAT ONLY 2 UNRELATED PERSONS OR OFFSPRING IN SINGLE HOUSE MAY OCCUPY THE ADU, THAT LANGUAGE IS A LIMIT CLEAR BUT ADU PERMITTED WITH ACCESSORY BUILDING TOTAL NUMBER OF PERSONS RESIDING THE PRIMARY DWELLING UNIT AND ADU COMBINED SHALL NOT EXCEED LIMIT SPECIFIED IN SECTION 5.161A ACCEPT A THAT ONLY TWO UNRELATED PERSONS PLUS OFFSPRING LIVING IN SINGLE HOUSEKEEPING UNIT MAY OCCUPY ADU AND B FUNCTIONAL FAMILY ALLOWED BY SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE. AGAIN WE STRUCK OUT THIS WAS IN OUR PREVIOUS FEBRUARY 9 WORKING SESSION IT SHALL BE DESIGNED SO IT WILL REMAIN THAT OF SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENCE OR ATTACHED ACCESSORY BUILDING AS GARAGE OR CARRIAGE HOUSE, NINE ENTRANCE SHALL BE LOCATED ON SIDE OR REAR OF THE BUILDING. WE DID STRIKE OUT ADU PERMITTED IN LILY CONFORMING ACCESSORY BUILDING THAT WAS CONSTRUCTED BEFORE DECEMBER 31ST 2016 ADDITIONALLY IF EXISTING ACCESSORY BUILDING IS MORE THAN 200 SQUARE FEET OF FLOOR AREA MAYBE REPLACED OR MODIFIED USING ADU AS NEWER MODIFY ACCESSORY BUILDING LEGALLY CONFORMING AND NON-CONFORMING ACCESSORY BUILDING CONSTRUCTED BEFORE DECEMBER 31ST OF 2016 WHICH IS OVER 200 SQUARE FEET OF FLOOR AREA MAYBE REPLACED OR MODIFIED USES ADU AS LONG AS NEWER MODIFIED ACCESSORY BUILDING IS LEGALLY CONFORMING. THAT IS A LOT OF WORDS TO SAY, A ADU IS PERMITTED AS OR WITHIN ANY SYCES RID BUILDING SO WE HAVE TAKEN OUT THE REQUIREMENT THAT WE HAD TO HAVE DETACH ACCESSORY STRUCTURE BACK IN 2016 THAT WAS CONFORMING IN ALL AT LEAST 200 SQUARE FEET.
02:59:15.999: >> WHAT IS THE NEW LANGUAGE? IT HAS ONE SINGLE FAMILY DWELLING AS PRINCIPLE USE ADU OR SINGLE FAMILY DWELLING SHALL BE SUBJECT TO PERIODIC HOUSING INSPECTION REQUIRED BY SECTION 8511. LEASING REMEMBER TALL OF ADU LESS THAN 30 DAY CONTINUES TO BE PROHIBITED. AND I THINK FROM OUR LAST COUPLE OF MEETINGS THIS WAS SHOWN AT ORC ALSO QUESTIONS ABOUT GETTING SOME DATA FROM HOW MANY ADUs OR SINGLE FAMILY PARCELS ARE IN THE CITY. IT'S DIFFICULT TO READ ON THIS ONE BUT I'LL READ IT OUTLOUD THERE ARE 17,658 PARCELS R 1A THROUGH R 1E SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENTIAL. BUT THE WAY OLD ORDINANCE WAS WRITTEN 16,948 WERE GREATER THAN 5,000 SQUARE FEET. SO ABOUT 96% QUALIFIED FOR THE ADU. SO PART OF THE ADU OR I'M SORRY THE HOMESTEADED PROPERTIES 15,203 PARCELS OF THOSE SINGLE FAMILY HOMES ARE HOMESTEADED WHICH MEANS THEY ARE FOR THE MOST PART OWN OWNER OCCUPIED SO 86% OF THE HOMES ARE OWNER OCCUPIED. WHAT WE ARE CONSIDERING NOW IS THE R 2A THROUGH R 4D YOU SEE THROUGH STATISTICS THERE ARE 2,519 TOTAL PARCELS FOR THAT R 2 WHICH IS BASICALLY DUPLEX DISTRICT. OF THOSE, 1684 ARE LESS THAN 8500 SQUARE FEET. IF YOU ARE OVER THE 8500 WE FEEL THEY WOULD DEVELOP THOSE AS DUPLEXES AND NOT GO FOR THE AD U. OF THOSE 1,044 HOMESTEADED WHICH IS 62% THIS IS JUST THE R 2 A AND B DISTRICTS. IN THE R 3 AND R 4 WHICH IS TOWNHOUSE AND MULTI-FAMILY THERE ARE 4,602 PARCELLS LESS THAN MINIMUM LOT SIZE AND OF THOSE 2,961 ARE HOMESTEADED OR OWNER OCCUPIED WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY 64% AND THE R 4B THERE'S 676 PARCELS LESS THAN MINIMUM LOT SIZE OF LESS THAN 3,000 SQUARE FEET. 324 OR 48% HOMESTEADED. IN THE R 4C THERE ARE 1899 PARCELS BUT ONLY 25 ARE HOMESTEADED SO .01% ARE OWNER OCCUPIED AND OPINIONLY THE R 4D 107 PARCELLS 60 HOMESTEADED SO APPROXIMATELY 56% WE CAN REFER TO THESE IF WE NEED TO DURING THDISCUSSION. THERE ARE CERTAIN TYPES OF AD U. ENTERFOR YOUTTACHED POSSIBLY IN THE BASE. ALSO UNDER ADDITIO AS LONG AS STILL CONTINUING TO MEET THE SIDEET BACKSND REAR SET WHICH YOU CAN SEE ON THE BOTTOM OF T PAGE WHICH IS TYPICALLY MORE LIKE A GARAGE. WOULD HAVEO BE 35% OFOUR AR YARD AND BET LEASTHREE FEET FRO SID AND REAR LOT LINE. HERE IS WHAT A TYPICAL GARAGE LO AT DACHED ARC WITH PARKG AND RESIDENTS ABOVE, I'M GOINTO TURN IT TO JEFF KAH, OUR LA WKINGESONTIONSROM REGARDG HOW HER CMUNITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAVE DONE THEIR ADUs AND IF THEY WERE EITHER OWNER OCCUPIED OR NOT HOPEFULLY JEFF IS ON THE LINE. LET ME KNOW WHEN SWITCH SLIDES JEFF.
03:03:10.700: >> OKAY. I ADDED A FEW SLIDES. FROM MY JOURNEYS AROUND THE COUNTRY. THAT ILLUSTRATE WHAT VARIOUS ADUs LOOK LIKE. THIS HAPPENS TO BE IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY IN CALIFORNIA. A NEW CHANNEL THAT WAS BEGAN THAT WAS STARTEDDED IN THE 1980s YOU CAN SEE SORT OF A FRONT IMAGE AND SIDE IMAGE. CHRIS YOU CAN ADVANCE THE SLIDE. THIS IS IN -- ANOTHER NEW TOWN, DEBATERSBURG MARCH MARE THAT SHOW AS THREE STORY UNIT WHICH IS A LITTLE TALLER THAN WHAT WE WERE ALLOWED HERE IN ANN ARBOR BUT THOUGHT IT WAS A NICE ILLUSTRATION THIS IS IN MOUNT PLEASANT SOUTH CAROLINA IN A COMMUNITY THAT SHOW AS TWO STORY ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT TO THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE SCREEN, IN THIS CASE IT IS A DETACHED UNIT. WE SHOULD GO TO NEXT SLIDE. THIS IS AN IMAGE SHOWING HOW COMMON ADUs ARE IN TWO CITIES IN AMERICA THAT HAS CLOSE TO THE MOST ADU IN COMPARISON TO VANCOUVER COLUMBIA, VANCOUVER HAD A LOT OF THEM. I THINK EXTREME HOUSING COSTS IN VANCOUVER RESULTED IN POLICY MAKERS LOOKING AT ALL SORTS OF OPTIONS. I DID HAVE A CHANCE TO EXPLORE OTHER AMERICAN CITIES THAT ARE EITHER CONTEMPLATING WAITING THE OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENTS WITH THE OWNER OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENTS. AND CITIES THAT ALREADY HAVE THEM. SEATTLE AND PORTLAND HAVE THEM. AND AS FAR AS I COULD TELL THE NUMBER OF ADUs INCREASED QUITE SUBSTANTIALLY AFTER THE OWNER OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENT WAS REMOOD. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA JUST COUPLE OF YEARS AGO PASSED THE STATUTE THAT PROHIBITED LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FROM IMPOSING AN OWNER OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENT ON ADU. I BELIEVE THEY HAD A FIVE YEAR TERM ON THAT PARTICULAR STATUTE. WHICH I BELIEVE INSPIRES IN 2025. SINCE THEN CALIFORNIA WITNESSED SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS IN A NUMBER OF CITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. CHRIS GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE.
03:05:55.898: >> SO THAT -- DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING ELSE TO ADD?
03:06:00.336: >> I LOOKED A ATTICITISSER CITIES, MIDWEST AND AROUND THE COUNTRY, LIKE BLOOMINGTON AND MADISON, AND EUGENE, OREGON AND BOLDER. THEY ALL HAD OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENTS. OWNER OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENTS SO THE TWO CITIES THAT I COULD TELL THAT DID NOT WERE SEATTLE AND PORTLAND. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING MINNEAPOLIS IS CONSIDERING REMOVING THE OWNER OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENT BUT AT THIS POINT THOSE ARE THE TWO CITIES I FOUND THAT HAD IT. THAT IS IT FROM ME CHRIS.
03:06:39.909: >> THANKS, AS YOU LOOK AT THIS SLIDE I DID QUICK CALCULATIONS, IF I'M CORRECT ON WHAT I JUST PRESENTEDD ON THE DATA, IF WE DID ONE PERCENT FOR THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR IN SINGLE FAMILY R 1 DISTRICT THAT WOULD TOTAL 177 AD U. WE CURRENTLY HAVE 23 BUILT OR PROPOSED IN CITY OF ANN ARBOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS. AND IF WE DID ONE PERCENT OF THE R 2 THROUGH THE R 4s, I CALCULATED WE WOULD HAVE APPROXIMATELY 90 ADDED TO THE STOCK. SO IF WE WERE AROUND THAT 1 PERCENT I THINK WE WILL BE AROUND 167 ADU ALL TOGETHER R 1 ALL THE WAY UP TO R 4. SO JUST IN SHORT, JUST TO SUM UP WHAT I THINK WE HAVE DISCUSSED REGARDING THE ADU, IS THE -- THEY WILL BE PERMITTED ON -- ONE SINGLE FAMILY DWELLING AS THE PRINCIPLE USE IN ANY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT WE HAVE STRUCK OUT THE ONE DWELLING OCCUPIED BY OWNER, THAT THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT FOR RECORDED DEED RESTRICTION WITH SPECIFIC CONTENT, ADU IS PERMITTED AS OR WITHIN ANY LEGALLY CONFORMING ACCESSORY BUILDING B, TOTAL NUMBER OF PERSONS RESIDE MANAGE THE PRIMARY DWELLING UNIT AND THE ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT SHALL NOT EXCEED LIMIT SPECIFIED IN SECTION 5.61A EXCEPT ONLY TWO UNRELATED PERSONS PLUS OFFSPRING AS SINGLE HOUSEKEEPING UNIT MAY OCCUPY THE UNIT OR WHEN FUNCTIONAL IS BY SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE THE MINIMUM 30 DAY STAY IS REQUIRED AND 600 SQUARE FEET AD YOU KNOW ON 7200 SQUARE FOOT LOTS OR LESS, 800 SQUARE FOOT GREATER THAN 7200 SQUARE FOOT LOTS AND WE HAVE ALSO PROPOSED ONE PARKING SPACE FOR ADU OR NONE IF WITHIN QUARTER MILE FROM BUS STOP BE STRICKEN. NEXT STEP SO WE HAVE GONE THROUGH THE ORDINANCE REVISION COMMITTEE, THAT WAS BACK ON 2/23. WE ARE CONTINUING OR PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT AS THE ORDINANCE PROGRESSES. PLANNING CONSIDERATION IS TONIGHT. DEPENDING WHERE THAT GOES IF IT DOES GET APPROVED DENIED WE WOULD THEN MOVE TO CITY COUNCIL ACTION AND PLEASE TO THE PUBLIC FOLLOW ALONG AT OUR WEBSITE A 2 GOV.ORG/PLANNING W. THAT. THAT CONCLUDES THE PRESENTATION. I'M HEAR FOR QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE AND WE CAN REFER TO ANY SLIDES YOU MAY LIKE.
03:09:12.395: >> I WANT TO ADD FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE WHOLE COMMISSION P AND IF ANY MEMBERS OF THE ORDINANCE REVISION COMMITTEE WANT TO RESPOND TO THIS AS WELL, WE HEARD DURING THE WORKING SESSION WHEN OUR BROADLY SOLICITING COMMUNITY FEEDBACK ON THIS, SOME BY NO MEANS UNANIMOUS BUT SOME FEEDBACK AND QUESTIONS ABOUT OWNER OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENT ASSOCIATED WITH ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS. I WOULD CATEGORIZE THE DISCUSSION OF THE ORDINANCE REVISION COMMITTEE MEETING, TO BE INTERESTED BUT NOT RESOLVED IN THAT PROPOSED CHANGE. SO WHERE STAFF HAS COME FROM IS PROPOSING THAT CHANGE WITH THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF REALIZING MORE ACCESSORY DWELLING IN THE -- SO I WANTED TO BE CLEAR THAT I THINK THE ORDINANCE REVISION COMMITTEE MEETING OR COMMITTEE WAS SORT OF STILL WRESTLING WITH THAT REQUIREMENT BUT I WANT TO PROVIDE THAT LITTLE BIT OF RATIONALE WHY FROM A STARTING POINT STAFF FEELS LIKE IF PART OF GOAL OF CHANGE IS TO REALIZE MORE ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS WE BELIEVE THAT CHANGE WOULD ACCOMPLISH THAT. THAT'S ALL I WANTED TO ADD.
03:10:45.988: >> I HAVE A POINT OF CLAIRE IFCATION BEFORE WE OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING. WHEN YOU ON THIS SLIDE WHEN TALKING ABOUT THE OVERALL GOALS I WANT TO MAKE SURE WHAT IS STILL IN THERE IS THE NOTE IN TABLE 5.6-2 ABOUT THE FLOOR AREA. THAT WE ARE STILL PROPOSING THAT THERE BE A LIMITATION OF THE FLOOR AREA TO THE FLOOR AREA OF THE GROUND FLOOR OF THE PRIMARY STRUCTURE.
03:11:14.750: >> THAT'S CORRECT.
03:11:16.218: >> GREAT. I DIDN'T PAY ATTENTION ENOUGH TO THAT SLIDE. SO THAT'S HELPFUL. ANY OTHER POINTS OF CLARIFICATION?
03:11:24.627: >> COMMISSIONER ABRONS. THEN COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT.
03:11:29.131: >> COULD YOU ADVANCE TO THAT SUMMARY SLIDE YOU HAD UP A SECOND AGO? THAT WAS HELPFUL. COULD YOU SUMMARIZE WHAT THE OCCUPANCY LIMITS ARE IN --
03:11:47.717: >> THAT IS WHERE WE WERE DISCUSSING THE DEFINITION OF FAMILY AT ONE OF OUR MEETINGS. SO THIS --
03:11:52.688: >> AND RELATED PERSONS I THINK, RIGHT?
03:11:55.491: >> CORRECT.
03:11:56.425: >> SO WHAT WE ARE SAYING IS KEEPING THINGS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS -- IF YOU ARE AN R 1 OR R 2 DISTRICT YOU GET UP TO FOUR PEOPLE AND MAXIMUM YOU GET IN THE ADU IS TWO. BUT IF YOU HAPPEN TO BE IN THE R 3 OR R 4 WHICH DOES ALLOW FOR SIX UNRELATED INDIVIDUALS YOU ARE STILL KEPT AT 6 BUT YOU CAN HAVE ADU FOR PRINCIPAL STRUCTURE TO ADU OR YOU CAN HAVE LESS THAN FOUR IN THE PRINCIPAL STRUCTURE BUT STILL MAXED OUT AT SIX UNRELATED.
03:12:26.789: >> IN R 14, SORRY, DID YOU SAVOR SRI YOU SAID A VERSION WHERE A DU MAXES AT TWO?
03:12:37.500: >> AN R 1 AND 2 ZONING DISTRICTS THOSE ARE SING FARM I WILL AND TWO FAMILY P THOSE CURRENTLY ARE AT FOUR THEY WILL STILL REMAIN AT FOUR. AND WITH TWO O OF THEM BEING AT U SO YOU COULD HAVE TWO IN PRINCIPAL STRUCTURE, TWO IN AD YOU CAN. AND THE R 3 AND R 4 DISTRICT WILL STILL KEPT AT 6 INDIVIDUALS BUT YOU STILL ONLY CAN HAVE TWO UNRELATED INDIVIDUALS IN THE AD U.
03:13:02.625: >> BUT IN THE R 1 AND 2 CAN YOU HAVE 4 IN THE PRINCIPLE AND TWO
03:13:07.363: >> NO.? TOTAL IS FOUR THE MAXIMUM AT ANY ADU WHERE AN R 1, 2, 3, 4, YOU CAN HAVE TWO UNRELATED INDIVIDUALS.
03:13:18.107: >> ADULTS. THIS DOESN'T INCLUDE OFFSPRING.
03:13:21.744: >> THAT'S CORRECT.
03:13:23.012: >> CAN YOU HELP ME UNDERSTAND WHAT A FUNCTIONAL FAMILY IS?
03:13:26.882: >> WOW.
03:13:28.317: >> ALLOWED BY SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE AS MUCH
03:13:29.285: >> A FUNCTIONAL FAMILY WOULD BE PAM HI THAT RECEIVES A SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE AND YOU AS PLANNING COMMISSION DECIDES IT IS FUNCTIONING IN A MANNER OF A FAMILY BUT IT POTTIALLY EXCEEDS THE UP RELATED LIMIT AND IS NOT RELATIONSHIP. SO THERE COULD BE
03:13:55.344: >> WHAT WAS THE EXAMPLE MR. LENART THAT THAT MAYBE SOME COMMISSIONERS REMEMBER, WHERE THEY HAVE PRIESTS OR CLERGY ORING THAT WANTED TO LIVE IN THE HOUSE AND I FORGOT HOW MANY BUT I BELIEVE IT WAS APPROVED THAT THEY COULD HAVE SIX PRIESTS LIVING TOGETHER IN A US WHO HOLD AND WE CONSIDERED THAT AS SPECIAL EXEMPTION EXCEPTION AS A FAMILY.
03:14:15.698: >> I SEE. AT IS MY ONLY CLARIFICATION. THANK YOU.
03:14:23.138: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT.
03:14:25.007: >> RELATED TO THAT, I READ ONE OF THE PUBLIC COMMENT THAT SAID THIS IS INCREDIBLY CONFUSING I HAVE TO AGREE. IS THERE A WAY THE MAKE TABLE THAT MAKES IT ME CLEAR HA SHOWS LIKE IF IF YOU AN R THIS MR. CHENG YOU WALKED THROUGH, TO MAKE IT A LITTLE EASIER FOR PEOP TO UNDERSTAND BECAUSE THIS IS LIKE THERE IS A LOT OF STUFF INERE THAT THERE'S DEFINITIONS AT YOU HAVE TO GO FIND ANDNYWAY WE CAN MAKE THIS PORTION A AITTLE LESSIKE RKY, I THINK WLD BE REALLY TWO POINTS OF CLARIFY CLARIFICATIO SUOSED TO BENE PERCENT, NOT 1 RCENT. NOT THAT THAT IS SO VERY TINY. BUT THAT POINT OF -- MY REAL QUESTION OR POINT OF CLARIFICATION. FOR THE SET BACK WITHIN THREE FEET OF LOT LINE I SAW A LOT OF COMMENTARY ON THAT AS WELL. WHERE DID THREE FEET NUMBER COME FROM?
03:15:32.074: >> WE HAVE AN EXISTING ACCESSORY STRUCTURE IN OUR ORDINANCE SO LET'S USE A GARAGE FOR EXAMPLE, NOT AN ADU. ANY GARAGE WE USE THAT MUST BE AT LEAST MINIMUM OF THREE FEET FROM THE REAR SIZE PROPERTY LINE AND CAN NOT TAKE UP MORE THAN 35 PERCENT OF YOUR REAR YARD. THAT IS WHERE IT IS COMING FROM. THIS IS A -- THIS IS IS A ZONING MINIMUM. IF BUILDING DEPARTMENT DECIDES OTHER STRUCTURE THAT HAS TO BE WHEN YOU GET INTO -- HAVE TO BE SET BACK FURTHER TO BE FIRE RATED OR OTHER ISSUES FROM A ZONING PERSPECTIVE IF YOU ARE THREE FEET IN THE SIDE OF REAR YOU WOULD ALLOW A 21-FOOT TALL GARAGE WE HAVE USED ALSO FOR ACCESSORY STRUCTURE.
03:16:15.985: >> SO FOLLOWING ON TO WHAT WE HAVE HAD EXISTING.
03:16:19.455: >> YOU HEARD EXISTING GARAGES.
03:16:22.391: >> BUT IF SOMEBODY APPLIED FOR PERMIT STRUCTURE TO YOU AND THEN INSPECTOR CAME OUT AND MADE ASSESSMENT THAT IN FACT NO YOU HAVE TO BE WELL NORMAN THREE FEET AWAY FROM THE PROPERTY LINE BECAUSE OF X Y Z THAT DETERMINATION WOULD BE MADE THEN. AND IT WOULDN'T BE BUILT THREE FEET TO THE PROPERTY LINE.
03:16:41.810: >> CASE BY CASE, EITHER BUILDING CODE MAYBE UTILITY EASEMENT OVERHEADLINE THERE IS THERE ARE ISSUES UNDERGROUND EWE UNTILES. WE DON'T KNOW. THAT'S WHY I LOOK FROM A ZONING PERSPECTIVE. THERE COULD BE BUILDING DEPARTMENT PERSPECTIVES TOO.
03:16:58.994: >> IF I COULD JUMP IN ON THAT. I WANT TO PUT INTO PERSPECTIVE AND SOME OF THE ARC TECHS MIGHT HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THIS THAN ME OR I DO BUT I THINK THERE IS POTENTIALLY A FIVE FOOT REQUIREMENT FROM A FIRE CODE RATING POTENTIALLY SO I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT IT IS NOT NECESSARILY THE BUILD CODE IS GOING TO SAY YOU CAN'T BE GOVERNED BY ACCESSORY STRUCTURE SET BACKS BUT BY PRINCIPLE HOUSE, I THINK THAT WAS ADJUSTMENTS UNLESS IT WAS SOMETHING THAT CRISS INDICATED THAT THERE IS SOME PARTICULAR ATTRIBUTE OF THE PROPERTY YOU ARE PROBABLY TALKING A COUPLE OF FEET THAT PIPELINE BUILDING CODE MIGHT BE IMPACTING YOU ARE NOT TALKING LIKE TEN FEET. I WANT TO BE CLEAR AND UP FRONT.
03:17:49.478: >> OKAY. FROM THANK YOU. UNLESS THERE'S OTHER QUESTIONS ABOUT IT, TO YOUR QUESTION I'M HAPPY TO SHARE A PIECE THAT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON SORT OF A SUMMARY TABLE TO SEE IF THAT RESONATES WITH THE QUESTION YOU HAD COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT.
03:18:08.864: >> GREAT. THAT WOULD HELP.
03:18:17.806: >> COMMISSIONER SUAVE THEN COMMISSIONER CLARKE. MY HAND IS UP OVER YOUR -- NEVER MIND.
03:18:24.646: >> I HAD A QUESTION ABOUT THE LONG TERM RENTALS. NOW THAT WE HAVE THAT TERMINOLOGY. IS THERE -- SO REGISTERED AS RENTAL, IS THERE ANY CASE THAT IS ADU WOULD NOT BE REGISTERED AS A RENTAL AND WHO WOULD OCCUPY THE ADU IF YOU DIDN'T REGISTER IT AS A RENTAL? Z
03:18:45.467: >> IF THE ADU WAS OCCUPIED BY OWN OWNER OF PROPERTY AND RENTING OUT MAIN SINGLE FAMILY DWELLING THE AU WOULDN'T BE REGISTERED THE HOUSE WOULD BE.
03:18:58.514: >> IS THERE A CIRCUMSTANCE THE EXTEN FAMEDLY WOULD LIVE IN ADU AND NOT REGISTER IT OR WOULD STILL REQUIRE RENTER REGISTRATION?
03:19:07.122: >> I WOULD HAVE -- THAT'S NOT A QUESTION I WOULD HAVE TO FOLLOW UP, I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT ARRANGEMENT WOULD WORK. SURE THAT QUESTION IF SOMEBODY BOUGHT A DUPLEX AND FAMILY MEMBER LAS VEGASES ON OTHER SIDE, I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT.

I I AM I WROTE YESTERDAY EXPRESSING FIVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE PROPOSED ADU ORDINANCE REVISION INCLUDING THE CON CON CONFUSING MR. LANG: NO -- NO ENFORCEMENT CONSIDERINGS AND PROPERTY TAX AND FEE UTILITIES. THE OWNER OKAY PAY SEASON REQUIREMENT AND MISLEADING SAMES ABOUT WHO THE ADU ORDINANCE BENEFITS. I WON'T REPEAT ALL THESE CONCERNS BUT I WOULD LIKE YOU YOU THE CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING SCENARIO. IMAGINE YOU ARE A SENIOR CITIZEN LIVING IN A FAMILY ZONE NEIGHBORHOOD THE LAST 40 YEARS. YOU'RE PASSED AND YOU ARE LIVING BY YOURSELF. YOUR CHILDREN LIVE ON THE WEST COAST. THIS PERSON DOES NOT PARTICIPATE IN SOCIAL MEDIA. AND IS LIMITED COMPUTER SKILLS. ONE DAY HEADS NEIGHBOR CALLS HIM AND INDICATES HE HAS SOLD HIS PROPERTY TO AN ABSENTEE INVESTOR THAT HAS LEFT THE AREA. SEVERAL DAYS LATER THE SENIOR CITIZEN HEAR AS TRACTOR IN NEIGHBORS BACKYARD AND ASKS THE WORKER WHAT IS GOING ON. HE LEARN AS 21-FOOT TALL 800 SQUARE FOOT LEARNING SPACE DETACHED STRUCTURE WAS BEING BUILT THREE FEET FROM THE LOT LINE. THE NEW OWNER DIDN'T CONTACT HIM ABOUT THESE PLANS AND CITIZENS DIDN'T KNOW HOW THE CONTACT THE NEW OWNERMENT OF HE ASKED HOW THIS IS ALLOWED THE REPORT PER REPLIED IN NEW ORDINANCE RECENTLY PASSED TO THE -- IT WAS CALLED ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT. THE SENIOR CITIZEN WAS STUNNED AND COULDN'T UNDERSTAND HOW THE LAW COULD HAVE BEEN CHANGED WITHOUT HIM KNOWING. HE HAD RECEIVED NO WRITTEN NOTICE. THE CONSTRUCTION LASTED 8 MONTHS AND NOISE DOES UNBEARABLE. A THE CONSTRUCTION COMPLETED SIX PEOPLE MOVED IN THE MAIN STRUCTURE AND FOUR MOVED IN ATTACHED STRUCTURE. THE SENIOR CITIZEN WAS VERY CONFUSED. HOW COULD THESE NUMBERS BE ALLOWED? SO HE CALLS CITY HALL AND EXPLAIN THE SITUATION TO THE THE OPERATOR WHO FORWARD --
03:23:43.732: >> TO THE VOICE MAUL. HE MATE AND BUT NO RESPONSE HE HAD IDEA WHAT TO DO. THINK AGAIN IF YOU THINK THIS IS AN UNLIKELY SCENARIO. I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU THIS IS A CAN OR WORMS YOU ARE OPEN OPENING. PLEASE DO NOT APPROVE THE ORDINANCE REVISION WITH APPROVAL WITHOUT ROBUST CITIZEN ENGAGEMENT AND WITHOUT ENFORCEMENT PROVISION THAT INCLUDES AN INCREASE IN ENFORCEMENT STAFF. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

03:24:44.159: >> WE CAN.
03:24:44.860: >> I WON'T GO TOO FAR INTO NOTICE ISSUE BECAUSE I THINK MR. CROCKETT SPELLED THAT OUT IN DEPTH AND I WOULD ECHO THAT. THE -- I GUESS I HAVE A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE ON IT. I JUST GOT A POST CARD IN THE MAIL SATURDAY TELLING ME ALL ABOUT SNOW REMOVAL WHICH IS PRETTY MUCH OVER THIS WINTER, CITY JUST SENT THAT OUT. SEEMS TO ME IF WE CAN SEND OUT A NOTICE OF SNOW REMOVAL AT THE END OF THE WINTER WE CAN SEND OUT A POST CARD TO HOME OWNNESSORRERS THAT WOULDN'T BE EFFECTED BY THIS, WOULDN'T COSINE NOR. YOU MIGHT BE GET MORPE THAN YOU WANT AT THIS PARTICULAR PUBLIC HEARING BUT PEOPLE WOULD KNOW ABOUT THIS BEFORE IT HAPPENED AND THAT I THINK IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. THE SECOND TOPIC I HAD IS ABOUT THE LOT LINES THAT CHRIS JUST EXPLAINED A MINUTE AGO. I USED TO NEAR LIVE -- ACROSS THE STREET. MY HOUSE WAS NEXT TO A CORNER LOT, MY BEDROOM WINDOW WAS FIVE FEET FROM THE LOT LINE. IF YOU COU -- MY NEIGHBOR IF THIS ORDINANCE PASSED COULD HAVE BUILT 21-FOOT THING LOOKED DOWN TO MY BROOM WINDOW FM 8 FEET AWAY. SEEMS TO ME THAT I -- AGAIN I WANT TO MAKE CLEAR THAT I'M IN FAVOR OF EXPANDING ADU TO ALL ZONING DISTRIBUTES AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE BUILT BUT I THINK THAT'S WAY TOO CLOSE AND I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD RELY ON BUILDING DEPARTMENT O MOVE IT BACK A COUPLE OF FEET. IT SHOULD BE TEN FEET, 15 FEET, 20 FEET, SOMETHING LIKE THAT. GRASS AND IT'S -- THIS IS DIFFERENT THAN GARAGE OR ART STUDIO, WHERE SOMEONE IS LIVING ALL THE TIME AND YOU ARE LIVING EIGHT FEET FROM THEM POTENTIALLY ALL THE TIME. I JUST I DON'T THINK THAT'S GOOD. THTHIRD ITEM IS OWNER OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENT, I HEARD SOME NOT DETAIL BUT SOME DATA POINTS ABOUT OWNER OCCUPANCY REMOVAL OF THAT REQUIREMENT WOULD RESULT IN MORE ADU. I WOULD STRESS WHAT KIND OF ADU AND HOW EXPENSIVE THEYRE AND WHAT HAPPENEDD TOHE HOUSE. THE POINT THAT MR. CROCKETT MADE A VERY GOOD ONE, IF U YO DOT HAVE DATA TO WHAT THOSE ADU WERE THAT WERE TN YOU DON'REALLY KNOWHAT YOU HAVE. AND I WOU BETHI WILL OPEN UP A WAY OF VESTOR BUYS OF BE NOTN THE HSING STACK JUSTL KE THE STRSSUE, AND YOU WILL NTALS IN A LOSSF MODEST SALE HOUSING. I ST DON'T THINK THAT IS A RESULT THAT YOU NECESSARILY WANT. I THINK WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO DO IS LOOK AT ALABAMA ATTORNEYTIVE FINANCE FOR AD U. CITY GUARANTEE LOAN OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. THANK YOU.

IF OWNER OCCUPIED SHORT TERM RENTAL VACATE HOME COMPLETELY AND RENTS AS SHORTS TERM RENTAL FOR WHATEVER PERIOD TIME THAT PERSON IS STILL OCCUPANT AND PRINCIPLE RESIDENT. IN CONTRAST ADU OWNER IS NOT TO BE PRINCIPAL RESIDENT OR OCCUPANT OF PORTION OF THEIR HOME THAT IS AN ADU REGARDLESS HOW OFTEN THEY MIGHT RENT UNLESS OWNER USED FOR PERSONAL USE. THIS DEFINITION HAS A SERIOUS IMPACT ON ADU OWNERS AND WOULD BE ADU OWNERS. WE HOPE THAT YOU CAN RECONCILE THE DISPARATE TREATMENT OF TWO TYPES OF OWNER OCCUPANCY DEFINITION. THANK YOU.

SPECIFICALLY THE REMOVAL OF THE 5,000 SQUARE FOOT LOT SIZE MINIMUM REQUIREMENT REMOVAL OF ADDITIONAL PARKING REQUIREMENTS AS THE MAJORITY OF THE PROPOSED AD ARKS WITHIN QUARTER MILE OF THE BUS STOP REMOVAL OF THE REQUIREMENT THAT THE OWNER OF THE PROPERTY RESIDES ON THE PROPERTY AND LASTLY TO ENSURE MAXIMUM OCCUPANCY IS MAINTAINED. I'M REFERRING TO ALSO TO COMMUNICATION YOU MAY HAVE RECEIVED TODAY FROM RESIDENT JEAN HENRY, I'M JUST KIND OF DOVE TAILING THE -- THOSE SENTIMENTS THAT SHE HAS. SHE RELATED TO YOU A VERY PERSONAL STORY ABOUT WHY SHE WOULD BUILD AN ADU ON HER PROPERTY. I DON'T HAVE THE SAME EXACT CIRCUMSTANCES AS JEAN HENRY DOES BUT I HAVE VERY SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES IN TERMS OF WANTING THE TAKE CARE OF AN AGING PARENT AND ALSO LOOKING FORWARD TO MYSELF AND MY WIFE AGING IN PLACE, ON OUR PROPERTIES IN ANN ARBOR, SO ONCE AGAIN I'M IN SUPPORT OF THESE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME.

03:32:01.195: >> I'M SORRY, I'LL START MY THREE MINUTES NOW.
03:32:03.431: >> YES.
03:32:04.632: >> MY NAME IS CHRIS CLARKE I LIVE IN R 4C NEIGHBORHOOD ON EAST KING -- HISTORIC DISTRICT. WHEN THIS ADU IDEA WAS FIRST PRESENTED IT WAS PRESENTED AS WAY FOR SEEING USE TO AGE IN PLEASE. NOW IT IS ANYTHING BUT THAT. THE WAY THAT YOU ARE CURRENTLY CONFIGURING IT WITH NO REQUIREMENT FOR OWNER OCCUPANCY, IT WILL BECOME A RADICAL VEHICLE TO BE VIEWED AS INSTRUMENT FOR CORPORATIONS FOREIGN MONEY INTERESTS AND ABSENTEE LAND LORDS TO BUY HOUSES BUILD ANOTHER HOUSE ON THE SAME LOT AND RENT THEM BOTH. WHETHER SUCH WEALTHY ENTITIES HERB MONEY ON PROPERTIES IS OFTEN IRRELEVANT TO THEM. IT CAN SERVE AS A CORPORATE LOSS OR CONVENIENT WAY TO HIDE OR LAUNDER MONEY. THAT'S ALREADY HAPPENING IN ANN ARBOR. THESE GROUPS WITH THEIR ENDLESSLY DEEP POCKETS PAY CASH FOR HOUSES, WITH NO CONTINGENCIES. THEY ALREADY DO THAT ALL OVER UP TO. THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD. THERE ARE RELATORS WHO SPECIALIZE IN CORPORATE FOREIGN GROUPS SNAP UP DEALS. THEY DON'T LIFE L HERE AND WILL NEVER LIVE HERE. THEY ONLY WANT A SAFE PLACE TO PUT MONEY MONEY NOT A GOOD PLACE TO LIVE. THIS WILL NOT BRING DOWN RENTS. THEY DON'T CARE IF THERE IS PAY BACK FOREOR FOR YEAR LONGA MONEY IS DEPOSITED IN ANN ARBOR HOUSE. ANN ARBOR REAL ESTATE IS SECURE. FOR THOSE WITH HUGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY THAT IS NOT A PRESSING CONSIDERATION. THESE PRACTICES ALREADY SQUEEZE OUT FIRST TIME AND MIDDLE CLASS BUYERS, THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE TO GET A MORTGAGE. THOSE WHO ARE JUST STARTING JOBS AND FAMILILIES THAT IS TOO BAD FOR THEM, ISN'T IT? THEY GET TO PAY RENT AND NEVER GAIN EQUITY IN ANY KIND OF PROPERTY BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO LIVE HERE. AS FOR PEOPLE WITH CHILDREN WHO ATTEND OUR SCHOOLS AND PARTICIPATE IN THE LIFE OF THE COMMUNITY, THEY WILL BE NOR PLACE FOR THEM IN THIS KIND OF ANN ARBOR. THEY WILL JUST BE PRICED OUT. AND THAT'S ALREADY HAPPENING. HOW CONSIDER CONSIDER A PROGRAM WHICH WOULD TRANSFORM ANN ARBOR FOR THE WORST? I HAVE TO AGREE WITH RALPH AND HIS PHONE CALL WHEN SHE SAID IF YOU CAN SEND OUTPOST CARDS AT THE END OF THE SNOW SEASON TO TELL US TO REREMOVE SNOW FROM SIDE WALKS YOU CAN INFORM POST CARD TO OF WHAT -- ABOUT THIS RADICAL CHANGE THIS IS NOT A TWEAK THIS IS HUGE.
03:34:49.664: >> THANK YOU.
03:34:58.072: >> YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
03:35:01.709: >> THANK YOU. I'M CALLING IN TO SAY THESE CHANGES ARE NOT TWEAKS. YOU U ARE NOT RELAXING THE RULES. THESE ARE EXTREMELY DRASTIC CHANGES TO THE -- FROM THE CURRENCIES. THE BIGGEST IS REMOVING THE OWNER OCCUPIED REQUIREMENTS, AND ALLOWING BRAND NEW CONSTRUCTION OF 800 SQUARE FOOT DETACHED HABITABLE STRUCTURE OUTSIDE OF BUILDING ENVELOPE. THE NET EFFECT OF THOSE TWO IN PARTICULAR WILL BE AS LAST CALLER SAID, CASH BUYERS INVESTORS, OUTBIDDING HOPE OWNERS PARTICULARLY THE MORE HONEST END OF THE MARKET. THESE I KNOW GRADUATE STUDENTS LIKE MORE RENTAL UNITS CLOSE TO TOWN TO APPEAL THEM BUT THESE MORE MODEST HOUSES ARE GOING TO GET BOUGHT UP AND URN TUNED TO TWO RENTALS ARE NOT CLOSE TO TOWN, THEY WILL BE SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE MORE MODEST NEIGHBORHOODS PHAT OUT. SO WE DO HAVE ANOTHER WAY TO INCREASES THE HOUSING STOCK, CLOSE IN TO TOWN. AND IT'S NOT REALLY THAT HARD, YOU BROUGHT UP THE SLIDE TALKING ABOUT THE NUMBER OF R 2 UNITS OUT THERE AND I BELIEVE THE TOTAL NUMBER WAS 25 HAD BEEN -- 2,519. A LOT ARE MINIMUM LOTS. SO WE CHANT CHANGE. IF E CHANGE LOT SIZE TO LOT WIDE. IF YOU ARE UNDER 8500 SQUARE FEET YOU STILL CAN'T BUILD DUPLEX. WE CAN CHANGE THAT RULE IF YOU ARE LESS THAN 60 FEET WIDE YOU ARE 58 FEET WIDE YOU CAN'T HAVE A DUPLEX BUT YOU COULD IF WE CHANGE THAT RULE. THE NUMBER OF UNITS WE COULD ADD TO HOUSING STOCK IN THE CLOSED IN AREAS THAT APPEAL SPECIALLY TO GRAD STUDENTS I KNOW BECAUSE I'M A LANDLORD FOR GRAD STUDENTS WE HAVE A LOT OF R 2, PROPERTIES THAT ARE ALREADY DUPLEXES, YOU COULD CHANGE THAT RULE AND HAVE MANY MORE THAN THE 167 YOU ARE LOOK AT, 1 PERCENT IF YOU CHANGE THE UDA RULESOR RULES. THEY ARE NOT GOING TO ACHIEVE, P GOING TO BE A DIFFERENT MIX. WE ARE GOING TO LOSE HOME OWNERSHIP PEOPLE TRYING TO BUY HOUSES HERE, AND WON'T BE ABLE TO THEY ARE TOKING TO BUY A HOUSE ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN IN INSTEAD SO THEY WILL BE PEOPLE WHO WANT BUY HERE AND WHO ARE POSED TO COMPLETE IN BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO BUY A HOME OUTSIDE OF TOWN. SO WE ARE MIXING UP GOALS HERE. THE GOAL IS NOT SIMPLY HOW MANY MORE ADU WE GET. THE GOAL IS HOW WE CAN MEET OVERALL COMMUNITY GOALS. AND I DO HAVE A COMMENT ABOUT FINANCING BANKS ARE LINING ON THESE. THE ONLY PROBLEM IS NUMBER OF COMPS AND THAT DOESN'T TAKE VALUE THAT MANY ADU WE DON'T NEED THIS DRASTIC CHANGE TO GET MORE COMPS. THANK YOU.

DURING THE PRESENTATION THERE IS RELEVANCE OTHER CITIES THAT DIDN'T HAVE OWNER OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENTS FOR ADU. THAT FELT KIND OF -- I MISSED THE CONTEXT BUT CURIOUS WHAT IS IMPACT IN OTHER CITIES THAT DON'T HAVE OWNER OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENT. FOR PROPERTIES THAT HAVE A,U TO I WOULD LIKE THE HEAR MORE ON THAT AND OVERALL CONTINUE TO BE BETWEEN THIS AND ACTION BEING TAKEN AROUND SHORT TERM RENTALLINGS AND AIR B AND B AND RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS AND GOING INCREASINGLY CONCERNED BY WHO ALL IS MOTIVATING ACTION BEING AIKEN BY THIS PLANNING COMMISSION RESPECTFULLY.

THANKS.
03:44:08.222: >> THANK YOU.

EXILE CITY COUNCIL PLANNING COMMISSION OVEN OFTEN PROMOTE IMPRESSION ADU ARE A MOM AND POP ENTERPRISE, WHICH WILL HAVE MINIMUM IMPACT ON ON THE COMMUNITY, LOOSENING RESTRICTION OPS BUILDING ADU WILL DRASTICALLY CHANGE THIS. FAS OUT OF TOWN REAL ESTATE INVESTORS ARE WATCHING WHAT HAPPENS REGARDING ANN ARBOR ADU AND THEY WOULD LOVE TO GET INTO THE ACT. MEANWHILE MANY OF THE MORE THAN 20,000 ANN ARBOR SINGLE FAMILY HOUSEHOLDS WHO WOULD BE DIRECTLY AFFECTED BY LOOSENING OF ADU RESTRICTIONS HAVE NOT HEARD THIS BEING CONSIDERED. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PROPOSED CHANGE IS TO ALLOW A SECOND DETACHED HABITABLE STRUCTURE TO BE CONSTRUCTED IN THE SET BACKS IN ALL SINGLE FAMILY ZONES CATEGORIES.  . THAT MEANS THAT A SECOND HOUSE COULD BE CONSTRUCTED ON EVERY LOT IN EVERY SINGLE FAMILY ZONING CATEGORY. IN MY VIEW IF TWO DETACHED HOUSES ARE ALLOWED WHERE ONLY HOUSED WERE ONLY ONE HOUSE WAS ALLOWED PREVIOUSLY, THEN THIS IS IN EFFECT A REZONING.  THAT MEANS THAT EACH OF THE MORE THAN 20,000 AFFECTED ANN ARBOR HOUSEHOLDS SHOULD BE NOTIFIED BY A POST CARD THAT THIS REZONING PROCESS HAS BEGUN. MAILING ALL OF US A POST CARD ANNOUNCING THE REZONING PROCESS IS THE FAIR EQUITABLE THING TO DO. IT WOULD ALLOW FOR THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF ANN ARBOR RESIDENTS TO TAKE PART IN THE PUBLIC PROCESS. I THANK YOU FOR LISTENING TO THIS AND I WANT TO MENTION I GOT TWO POST CARDS ABOUT SNOW REMOVAL I'M SURE THE CITY CAN AFFORD THE SEND THE 20,000 AFFECTED HOUSEHOLDS HA POST CARD THAT TELLS THEM WHAT IS WHAT HAPPEN HAPPENING. WHAT IS PROPOSED BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE HAVE NO IDEA. THANK YOU SO MUCH.

03:47:19.613: >> HI. MY NAME IS KATE I LIVE AT 1912 ANDERSON BEHIND FRAZIERS. AND THIS IS SUCH AN INTERESTING TOPIC. AND I WOULD SAY THAT FROM 5,000 FEET HIGH AND THINKINGN'T THEORETICALLY IT IS GREAT IDEA AND I HAVE TALKED TO -- ABOUT ATE A COUPLE OF TIMES BECAUSE WE HAVE THOSE OF YOU WHO MIGHT KNOW THIS NEIGHBORHOOD, WE HAVE VERY LONG NARROW LOTS, WE ARE A MILE FROM DOWNTOWN, WE HAVE A YARD THAT COULD EASILY AT THE VERY BOTTOM OF YOUR YARD PUT A SMALL TWO STORY HOUSE THAT WOULD BE IDEAL FOR A SINGLE PERSON OR COUPLE WHO WE HAVE A LOT OF FRIENDS WHO WORK IN RETALL, IT WOULD BE THEIR DREAM TO LIVE THIS CLOSE TO DOWNTOWN. BUT WHEN WE LOOK INTO IT, IT IS A REALLY EXPENSIVE PROPOSITION AND WE WOULD BE DOING IT BASICALLY FOR AWE TRUISM. AND WE COULD YET DO THAT. IT COULD BE A GREAT WAY TO REPLACE THE THE KIND OF PROPERTY WILL TURN THE CITY INTO RENTALS. NO ONE BUT I THINK THE HATE OF THAT THE COUNCIL REALLY AND PLANNING COMMISSION THAT IT IS PICKY INSIDE BASEBALL, IS ABOUT SET BACKS DON'T LET THIS ONE SLIP BY YOU. OUR LOTS ARE VERY NARROW, WE HAVE MOST PEOPLE IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD HAVE ABOUT TEN FEET BETWEEN EACH OTHER AND THEY SPECTACULAR ORIGINALLY BUILT HOUSE GARAGE, HOUSE GARAGE. SO WE ARE NOT IF YOU ALLOW THESE SET BACKS DESIGNED NOT TO BUILD TO LIVE IN, YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE PEOPLE REALLY CHEEK TO JULY CLOSE THE EACH OTHER IN WAY THAT I DO NOT THINK FEELS IN GOOD FAITH WITH THE ZONING AT LEAST IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD AND WITH THE KIND OF GOOD FAITH PEOPLE BROUGHT THEIR PROPERTIES FOR. FASOR THEY POUT THOSE PROPERTIES BECAUSE THEY EXPECTED A CERTAIN KIND OF LIFE AND I AGREE WITH THE PREVIOUS CALLER WHO SAID YOU ARE ESSENTIALLY CHANGING ZONING SIGNIFICANTLY AND I THINK YOU HA TO THINK ABOUT THAT IN SOME WAY.

03:50:35.642: >> THIS IS JOAN, FORMER COUNSEL MEMBER FORMER PLANNING COMMISSIONER. I KNOW ALL OF YOU LISTEN TO THESE PUBLIC COMMENTS ALL THE TEAM AND HEAR MANY OF THE SAME THINGS ALL THE TIME SO I HOPE THAT YOU WILL RECNIZE FEAR MONGERING WHEN YOU HEAR ITS. MANY CALL IRES WHO CALLED ARE SIMPLY FEAR AMONGING ARE WE SAW THE SLIDE AT THE BEGINNING THAT JEFF SHOWS THAT SHOW THAT EVEN WHEN THERE IS NO RESTRICTION ON OWNER OCCUPATION OF ADU ONLY 1% OF HOMES ACTUALLY HAVE THESE KINDS OF A AD Us. SO THE IDEA THAT'S SPECIALLY I'M USING AIR QUOTE HERE, FOREIGN BUYERS H COME IN AND BUY UP ALL THE PROPERTY SO THEY CAN BUILD EXPENSIVE ADUs WHICH OFTEN COST LAST TIME I SAW $200,000 TO BUILD ON AN ADU, IT SIMPLY IS RIDICULOUS AND AGAIN IT'S FEAR AMONGING ARE. THE REASON TO TO REME SOME OF ESE BARRIERS FOR ADUs IS TO INCREA THE AILABILITY O USING. IN ANN ARBOR WE NEE MOREION A HISTORY OF TRYING TO KEEPOF THINGS T WAY THEY ARE. SOME OF THTHING YOU HEARD. SAYING I DON'T WANT ANYE NEXT DON'T WANT  HRRACTOR BUILDI A HOU FOR FILY. NEXT DOOR TO ME. IT SIMPLY RIDICULOUS WHEN I -- IN ALL THE YEARS WHEN I WAS ON TO CITY COUNCIL AND ON PLANNING COMMISSION WHATEVER WE WANTED TO DO I OFTEN HEARD PEOPLE TALK ABOUT HOW THE ACTION WOULD DIMINISH PROPERTY VALUES. NEVER HAVE I EVER SEEN PROPERTY VALUES DIMINISHED IN IN ANY NEIGHBORHOOD IN ANN ARBOR NO MATTER. YOU COULD PUT A NEW CITY DUMP NEXT TO EXPENSIVE HOUSING AREA AND IT WOULDN'T DIMINISH THE HOUSE OR PROPERTY VALUES. WHEN YOU HEAR SOMETHING LIKE IT WILL DIMINISH PROPERTY VALUES, YOU ARE HEARING RACISM, IT IS A RACIST HISTORY WHEN PEOPLE THINK ANT WHAT THEIR PROPERTY VALUES ARE AND HOW BRINGING IN MORE PEOPLE AND MAKING THE COMMUNITY A DENSER COMMUNITY FULL OF MORE PEOPLE THAT THAT'S SOME SORT OF NEGATIVE, A RACE I WILLIST CONCEPT, A XENOPHOBIC CONCEPT, YOU OUGHT TO CONTINUE IN WHAT THE STAFF HAS RECOMMENDED, WHICH IS TO REMOVE BARRIERS RATHER THAN PUT THEM UP. WE NEED MORE HOUSING AND ANN ARBOR AND NEED TO REMOVE THE BARRIERS. THANKS.

03:54:03.817: >> THIS IS LINDA (INAUDIBLE) I'M NOT OPPOSED TO ADU IN GENERAL. BUT I REALLY WANT TO WARN YOU AGAINST ALL THE COMPENSATING IN THE NAME OF MEETING MORE HOUSING. THE FOOTPRINT YOUR ARE DOING AND HAGUE YOU ARE CONSIDERING IS WAY TOO BIG. I THINK THE ORIGINAL CONCEPT AS ADU IS MODEST AND YOU ARE OVERREAP REACHING AND THAT IS A BAD IDEA FOR SEVERAL REASONS. FIST ON A (INAUDIBLE) YOU ONLY GOT ONE (INAUDIBLE) IF YOU PUT ANOTHER BIG CONCRETE FOOTPRINT ON IT, YOU ARE REALLY IMPACTING THINGS LIKE YOU ARE MAKING MORE IMPERMEABLE SURFACE BAD FOR FLOOD RISK. YOU ARE INCREASING THE -- YOU WILL HAVE TO CUT ALL THE TREES DOWN TO PUT BUNCH OF ADUs THERE SO KEEP IT MODEST. THAT'S WHAT I THINK YOU SHOULD DO. I THINK WE NEED TO BALANCE A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS AND I THINK I TOTALLY SUPPORT AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE NEED MORE. BUT I THIS THAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO TOO MANY SIMPLE FIXES TO TRY TO REACH THAT GOAL. WITHOUT THINKING OF THE BROADER CONTEXT. SOME OF US SOLUTIONS AFFORDABLE HOUSING ARE VERY BAD FOR OUR N 2O GOALS WE NEED TO LOOK AT IT I 'ALLY I DON'T AGREE WITH (INAUDIBLE) FEAR AMONGING ARE. I DON'T THINK ANYBODY IS FEAR AMONGING ARE. YOU CAN LOOK AT EXAMPLES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, WHERE CERTAIN CORPORATIZATION OF HOUSING IS HAPPENING. I GET POST CARDS AT LEAST TWICE A MONTH.  I OWN GOT PROPERTY THIS IS TOWN, BOTH MODEST. I GET ALL THE TIME ON FREE CASH FOR MY HOME. ALL THE TIME. I DON'T THINK PEOPLE IN BURNS PARK GET THAT BECAUSE THOSE ARE EXPENSIVE HOMES. BUT AMOUNT OF HOMES ON THE OTHER SIDE AND FIFTH WARD WE GET THOSE POST CARDS. I'M WORRIED YOU ARE PROVIDE VIEDING INCENTIVESES FOR CORPORATE INVESTORS TO COME INTO OUR CITY AND SOON YOU WILL HAVE PEOPLE IN BURNS PARK AND WARD 2 ANN PAR BOAR HILLS AND REST OF THE CITY WILL BE A DESERT OF HIGH PRICED RENTAL UNITS. FOR MIDDLE CLASS PEOPLE AND SOME AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS FOR LOWER INCOME PEOPLE. AND THAT'S IT. THE INCOME GAP PEOPLE WILL GET WORSE AND WORSE. I'M NOT SIGHING I GUESS I'M SAYING YOU NEED TO LOOK AT THAT TIME UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF SOME OF THESE POLICIES YOU ARE CONSIDERING AND I DON'T KNOW THEY ARE DOING THAT YET. THANKS.

I THINK THE IDEA OF UNSPENDED CONSEQUENCES IS REALLY WORTH LOOKING AT, THIS DOES AMOUNT TO AN EFFECTIVE REZONING OF EXISTING LOTS. I THINK ALLOWING THE ADU TO BE LEGALLY DISCONNECT CONNECTED FROM THE PRIMARY PROPERTY ALLOWING LOT SUBDIVISION WITHOUT A PROCESS, I THINK IT IS INEVITABLE OPERATING OWNER OCCUPANCY FROM THESE AD WILL LOWER THE AMOUNT OF HOMEOWNERS IN TOWN AND ENCOURAGE PEOPLE WHO ARE SIMPLY INVESTORS TO DRIVE THE MISSOURI TEST HOMES. OUTCOMPETE PEOPLE LIVERRENING MORE MODEST HOMES OUT OF TOWN. IT WILL SOMEONE ELSE POINTED OUT CONTINUE TO EXACERBATE INCOME DISPARITIES IN TOWN. I MYSELF HAVE GOTTEN CASH OFFERS FOR MY HOUSE IN MAIL AND POST CARDS,S THAT REAL THINGS, IT IS NOT FEAR AMONGING AREK PEOPLE EXPERIENCE WHAT'S HAPPENING. AND THIS DESERVE MORRIS ATTENTION THAN GETTING. I GOT A POST CARD AFTER SNOW MELTED WARNING ME TO KEEP SNOW OFF SIDE WALK. IT IS NOT YOUR FAULT BUT SHOULD BE A MARKER OF THE LACK OF COMMUNICATION THIS HAS BEEN, IT LOOK AS IF INTENDED TO A STEALTH PROCESS. NOT SAYING THAT IS IN YOUR HEART WHAT YOU WANTED. BUT THAT'S HOW IT COMES OFF AS CITY RESIDENT THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO STEALTH REZONING. AND STEALTH SUBDIVISION ACEMENT TEMPT TO ER OF NOER MODEST HOMES FROM OWNER OCCUPIED MARKET.

IF YOU ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE ORC IT IS AN ADVISORY GROUP TO HELP STAMP GET BIT OF A GUT CHECK SOUNDING BOARD FOR THINGS THAT I BRING US TO. IS OWNER OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENT I THINK THERE WERE COUPLE OF QUESTIONS ABOUT WHERE THIS CAME FROM AND WHO WAS ASKING FOR THIS. THIS WAS MORE SORT OF THE LAW OF UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AND I WILL TELL YOU I AM THE FIRST ONE THAT SAID I WAS TORN ABOUT THAT. SO I DO THINK THAT IS SOMETHING WE SHOULD DISCUSS. IN PARTICULAR WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE PREVIOUSLY WAS THE DEED RESTRICTION. I FELT LIKE THE RESTRICTION PUT UNDUE BARRIER TO OWNER OCCUPANTS TO ACTUAL I DO IT. ONE MORE GROUP YOU HAD TO STEP THROUGH SO I DIDN'T LIKE THAT PART. BUT THE SENSE WAS THOSE -- THAT THOSE THINGS SHOULD GO HAND IN HAND. THAT A OWNER OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENT AND THE DEED RESTRICTION HELP MAKE IT MORE ENFORCEMENT PERHAPS. AID AGAIN MY GOAL -- MY PERSONAL SENSE IS WE SHOULD BE LOWERING THE BARRIERS. SO AIM TORN ABOUT OWNER OCCUPANCY VERSUS NOT -- VERSUS VIKING THAT REQUIREMENT THAT I THINK THAT THE DEED RESTRICTION IS A STEP TOO FAR. SO BUT IN TERMS OF WHO IS ASKK FOR THAT, IT IS PLANNING COMMISSION THERE IS NO I DON'T KNOW I, THIS IS PULLING FROM IN MY SENSE CITY DOCUMENTS. THAT WE HAVE SEEN THAT ARE ONGOING CHALLENGING WITH SUSTAINABILITY AND AFFORDABILITY AND THIS IS AIMING TO TRY TO ENABLE THAT. I HAVE MORE LIST BUT IF ANYONE ELSE WANTS TO OFFER QUESTIONS. DISCUSSION. COMMISSIONER SUAVE.
04:02:56.783: >> IN CASE WE JUST TWO THROUGH ORC CHAIN OF THOUGHT. PI ASKED AND AM IN SUPPORT OF REMOVING OWNER OCCUPCY. I WILL BE CLEAR WITH THAT.  WHEN WE TALK CARROTS AND STICKS CREATING MORE HOUSING RENTING OR OWNERSHIP, WITHIN THE CITY LIMITS CLOSER FOR WORKOR WORK FORCE AN TRANSIT THIS IS ONE OF THE WAYS WE CAN DO IT, SO I THINK IF WE GET INVESTORS DOING THESE PROPERTYINGS TOO, WE ARE STILL INCREASING MORE UNITS DOUBLE -- TWO RENTALS INSTEAD OF ONE HOME OWNERSHIP, 85% HOME OWNERSHIP IN IS THE CITY IS PRETTY HIGH. IFHAT WAS DOWN TO 75% BECAUSE OF THE IMPACT, DO NOT THINK THAT'S GOING TO IMPACT THE CHARACR OFF OUR IT WILL ENABLE DIVERSE WITH MORE PEOPLE DOING WORK FORCE HOUSING MORE DYNAMIC TYPES OF FAMILY MOVING IN AND SO I'LL SAY THAT' WHERE I STAND ON THAT ISSUE AND IT WAS PART -- MY REQUEST O ORC T SEE IT AND WE WENT BACK AND FORTH HOW T PRESENT IT TOGHT. NIGH I'M ON THE SIDE IT'S PRESENT AS IT IS ANDHAT IS MY PFERENCE.
04:04:16.662: >> COMMIIONERBRONS THEN MMISSIONER CLAE. I ALS AM ON ORC SO CAN WEIGH IN AITTLE BIT WHE MY THOUGHTSERE. THE ATEMEN IF I HENYEIT SITATIONT WOUL B AUT TIMINGND ABOUT MAKING SPACE IN TIME FOR APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF DELIBERATION AND DEBATE. BUT IN TERMS HOW I FEEL ABOUT THE OWNER OKAY PAPACY REQUIREMENT, I THE HI EMBEDDED IN IT IS THE SAY POSITION OR STANCE OR YEAH OR OPINION THAT RENTERS THAT'S ANTI-RENTER THAT ASSUME AS RENTER IS A LESS RESPONSIBLE TENANT AND LESS STEWARD OF THEIR OWN HOME. LESS SOMEBODY WHO INVESTED LESS CARE OF NEIGHBORHOOD THAT IS NOT A POINT OF VIEW THAT I HOLD OR ATTORNEYS. I THINK WE SHOULD IF WE ARE TALKING -- INTERESTED IN LIFTING BARRIERS TO CONSTRUCTION OF ADU WHICH I THINK WE ARE, IN THE PURSUIT OF OUR GOALSES VERSUS AFFORDABILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY
04:05:29.635: >> I THINK WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT ADU AS OTHER FORMS OF HOUSING. SO REPRODUCIBILITY TO SUBJECT THEM TO STRICTER PROHIBITION OR AUTHORIZATION OTHER HOUSING IS NOT SUBJECT TO FEEL LIKE A CON RA DICTION, IF I OWN A SINGLE -- IF I CAN RENT MY SING FAMILY HOME, NOT LIVE THERE I CAN BUY A HOME AND RENT IT, IT SEEMS TO ME THERE SHOULDN'T BE -- THERE IS NOT AN OWNER OCCUPANCY FOR SINGLE FAMILY HOME SO NOT SURE WHY THERE WOULD NEED TO BE ONE NOR ADU SAME SET OF RULES GOVERN BOTH FORMS OF HOUSING. AND I THINK THAT IF LISTING THE OWN OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENT MEANS MORE GET BUILT WHICH SEEMS TO BE ONE CONCERN OF VOICES WE WE ARE HEAR, THAT IS THE GOAL TO BET MORE BUILT. I ALSO WANT TO SAY I THINK WE HAVE HEARD IF WE LOOK IN OUR WRITTEN COMMUNICATION THERE IS MORE PLANS IN FEEDBACK FROM COMMUNITY MEMBERS ABOUT PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT THESE CHANGES AND PEOPLE WHO HAVE CONCERNS AND OPPOSE THEM. THAT'S NOT WHAT E WE HEARD IN THE PUBLIC HEARING BUT IF WE TAKE AS WHOLE AND THINK ABOUT THE COMMENTS FROM PUBLIC DURING THE WORKING SESSION IT WAS MISSOURI BALANCED. THAT BALANCE SIGNIFY THIS IS SAW COMPLEX ISSUE A. CXFC THERE IS A LOT TO IT SO I DO WANT TO HAVE SPACE FOR ENOUGH DELIBERATION SO NOT EVEN FEELS THAT COMPLEXITY IS ABLE TO BELIEVE TO BE FEES TEATED OUT BUT FROM A POSITION OF SUPPORT FOR OWN B OCCUPANCY AND ORDINANTS AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN. THE'S OTHER CHANGE TO ELIMINATING PARKING, ET CETERA. FROM
04:07:21.580: >> COMMISSIONER CLARKE.
04:07:27.386: >> IT IS INTERESTING BECAUSE WE LOOK INTO ADU FOR MY MOTHER-IN-LAW WHO RELOCATED TO ANN ARBOR. THEY ARE ANNUAL THE MENTIONS VARIABLES THAT MADE IT INPEESABLE SHE BOUGHT A CONDO IN TOWN SO EFFECTIVELY TOOK OFF UNIT OUT MARKET DIDN'T CREATE A UNIT, IF SHE IS TRAVELING OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, PART OF THE YEAR GOING BACK TO WHERE SHE WAS WORKING BEFORE IT WILL BE EM I THE PART OF YEAR SO IT WOULD BE MORE E PATIENT FOR THE HOWING INVENTORY IF WE AD THE ATU AND THAT IS AN EXAMPLE HOW THIS CAN BENEFIT AND THINGS LIKE ONE OF THE HINGE THE PARKING RESTRICTION IS REALLY BIG FOR THE NARROW LOTS, LIKE OURS, WOULDN'T BE AWITHDREWED TO HAVE DOUBLE STACK PARKING BUT THEN WITH THE A ADU CONSTRUCTION WOULD PERMIT US FROM GETTING TWO CARS PARKED. SORRY. THAT WAS CONFUSING. SO WE ARE MOVING THOSE BARRIERS DON'T SEE HOW THERE IS A MASSIVE FLOOD. LIKE SHERIFF EVER INVESTORS WE HAVE THEM REGARDING. I BET I GET THESE FROM OUR HOUSE. I SEE CERVELATSES SMALL MODEST HOUSES THAT ARE AT THE END OF THEIR LIFE CYCLE NEEDING REHABS AND THEY ARE GETTING DEVELOPED TO LARGE SINGLE FAMILY TO MY -- I MEAN IF IT TAKING UP THE SAME AMOUNT OF LOT AS SIN. FAMILY HOME, I WOULD THINK THAT MAYBE HAVINGS THAT ADU THERE IS A BETTER -- AS IF THEY ARE GOING TO INVEST IN TWO HOUSING UNITS THAT CAN ADD TO THE MARKET I RATHER THAN THAN INVESTOR BUILD A LARGE PROPERTY.  ALSO THERE'S A LOT OF PROPERTIES ANOTHER POINT CONSIDERATION IS WE DO ATTRACT INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL PEOPLE IS PEOPLE FROM NEW YORK AND HOUSING ISN'T SUPER EXPENSIVE RELATIVE TO THAT. SO THESE CASH BUYERS INVESTING IS ALWAYS A THING BECAUSE WE ARE ALMOST TWO OPERATES MARKETING WITHIN -- WE HAVE THIS NATIONAL BUBBLE IN ANN ARBOR MICHIGAN LEVEL OF KNOWLEDGE THAT DOESN'T ALIGN AND SO I THINK THAT THE IDEA OF INVESTORS MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT I TAKE A LITTLE BY OF ISSUE WITH THAT'S SPECIALLY INTERNATIONAL INVESTORS WE HAVE HUGE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, WE HAVE PEOPLE FROM ABROAD SO I QUESTION WHETHER IT MIGHT NOT BE GREAT TO CAT FORRIZE THEM AS NEFARIOUS. IT WOULD BE INTERESTED IF THAT WAS SOMETHING TAKING PLACE BUT UNTIL WE HAVE THAT INFORMATION IT'S HARD THE TAKE IT INTO; CAN.
04:10:16.655: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT.
04:10:22.394: >> I CAN ALSO WEIGH IN ON MY THOUGHT PROCESS LAST WEEK I WAS IN SUPPORT OF REMOVING THE OWNER OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENT I HI THIS WEEK MORE SO IN FAVOR OF REMOVING I THINK COMMISSIONER ABRONS AND SUAVE SAID IT MORE ELOQUENTLY THAN I CAN AT 11 P.M. BUT I WILL MENTION THIS IS LINKED FROM SCOTT TRUDEAU AND CORRESPONDENCE BUT I WEPT THROUGH THE ARP STATE ACT AND LOCAL STATE ACT DOCUMENT SO THEY ORIGINALLY PUT O IN 2000, OVER TWO YEARS AGO. (INAUDIBLE) 20 YEARS AGO THAT DOCUMENTED RECOMMENDED OWNER OCCUPANCY AND HAY CHANGED THAT THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS. I THINK FOR REASONS THAT WE DISCUSSED, IT DOES -- IT IS MOVING THAT DOES PUT MORE HOUSING SUFFICIENT INTO THE COMMUNITY. THERE ARE LEGITIMATE ISSUES WITH FINANCING THAT MAYBE NOT EXPERT BUT I THINK HAVING SPECIALLY A DEED RESTRICTION ISSUESES WITH LENDING, SO PORTLAND AND SEATTLE EXAMPLES GIVEN EARLIER RECENTLY MOVED THE OWN OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENT AND SAW INCREASE IN AD U. THIS IS ALREADY MENTIONED I THINK THIS A IS GOAL OF THIS. I DON'T -- I THINK HAVING THAT REQUIREMENT EFFECTIVELY MAKES IT RESTRICT WHAT IS YES TRYING TO DO. IF OUR GOAL IS TO CONCURRENT MORE WE SHOULD REMOVE RESTRICTIONS. IF THIS BECOMES SOMETHING THAT HAS UNINTENDED CONESS WEDNESDAY I TONE SITE NECESSARILY HAPPENING BUT ALWAYS SOMETHING TO REVISIT SINCE THIS ORDINANCE FOUR YEARS AGO ONLY 20 (INAUDIBLE) I THINK WE NEED GIVE THIS HA SHOT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE MORE DIKERS SRI THE HOUSE STOCK. I HAVE OTHER THINGS. BUT THAT WAS MY THOUGHT PROCESS. I SUPPORT OWNER OKAY OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENT.
04:12:28.987: >> COMMISSIONER DISCH.
04:12:33.325: >> I WANT TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT A LITTLE BIT. NOT THAT WE CAN'T COME BACK TO THIS. THE RATIONALE FOR REMOVING THE ONER OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENT BUT THERE HAVE BEEN QUESTIONS ABOUT WHO PROFITS FROM ADU THAT A LO T OF THE CALLERS RAISED. WE HAVEN'T TALKED WHO USES ARCDU. WHO OCCUPIES THEM. WHO RUNS THEM. ONE OF THE EULAMINATING PARTS OF THAT STUDY THAT COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT MENTIONED IS THAT IS THIS LITTLE BIT ABOUT IN VANCOUVER WHERE I THINK THE DATA IS INTERESTING BECAUSE THERE'S MORE OF IT. SINCE THERE'S 35% STOCK WE CAN DEBT GET A BERTH SINCE SENSE OF TRENDS. CORK TO A 2018 SURVEY OF OKAY PANTS IN VANCOUVER, ONE THIRD OF ADU OKAY PANTS HAD INCOMES BETWEEN HALF AND TWO-THIRDS OF THE MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME. THAT IS SERVING A SIGNIFICANT POPULATION EVEN AT ONE-THIRD OF THE ADU OKAY PANTS THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT POPULATION OF PEOPLE WHO PROBABLY ALMOST CERTAINLY CANNOT AFFORD TO BUY A HOUSE IN VANCOUVER WHERE THEY ARE INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE AND I THINK VANCOUVER IS HAMMED IN SO NOT AS AVAILABLE IN AMERICA. IN SOME AMERICAN CITIES WE CAN SPREAD. SO THAT INTERESTED ME. AND OF COURSE THE HISTORY OF ADU HAS OFTEN BEEN MEANS OF ELDER CARE. SO I DON'T KNOW IF THAT IS STILL TRUE. BUT THIS FACT WAS INTERESTING TO ME. IT'S LATE. BUT I THINK I DO WANT TO SAY THIS ONE THING. FROM PREVIOUS DISCUSSION. AND THIS IS I THINK DIRECTED TOWARDS ALL OF YOU BECAUSE YOU TALKED ABOUT THIS MORE BEFORE I GOT ON PLANNING. CERTAINLY MR. LENART HAS BEEN WORKING MORE BUT SO WE ARE TRYING TO REMOVE OBSTACLES TO PEOPLE BUILDING A ADU. ABSOLUTELY. AND WHAT LITTLE DATA WE HAVE, ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE U.S. AND OTHER CITIES SUGGESTS THAT WE ARE MOVING THE OWNER OCCUPIED REQUIREMENT WE DO THAT. BUT WE ARE DOING THIS NOT BECAUSE WE THINK ADU ARE DESIRABLE FOR THEY WERE OWN SAKE BECAUSE WE WANT TO ADVANCE GOALS OF INCREASING THIS SUPPLY OF MORE AFFORD EARLYORABLE DI VERSE HOUSING FOR RESIDENT NOT TOURISTS. WHERE LOOKING FOR A SWEET SPOT WHERE THE DESIGN PREMIUMS OR OTHER THINGS THAT WE DO. TO GIVE PEOPLE INCENTIVE. AND SO WE PROHIBITED USE OF SARKSDU AS STR BECAUSE USING THEN AS STR WORKS AGAINST OUR AFORDIBILITY AND CARVING REDUCTION GOALS. BUT I I THINK IT'S BORT ASKING, WHETHER THIS PROHIBITION DISCOURAGES PEOPLE FROM CREATING ADU T A YOU WILL A. THERE IS INFLEXIBILITY. I'M ONLY RAISING THIS AS A QUESTION. I AM NOT TRYING TO ADVOCATED ANYTHING HERE. I'M JUST ASKINGER TO SURE SE YOU HAD A RATIONAL FOR THE SWEET SPOTR YOUR SPENCE THAT'S NO PEOPLE FROM CREATING ADU.G DON'T MIND IF THERE IS NOT AN QUTION.BUT PUTTING OUT THE FROM CNG WH RIONALE FOR THETR REDISTRIBUTIO INSTRUCTION.
04:16:48.146: >>PROFSOR:  I'LL SRT BY SAYING A ADR0AY RESTRTION WAS I WOD SAYAPPEDEFORE REGULATION AROUND SHORT TERM RENTAL. AND I MY LENS CAN'T SPEAK FROM PLANNING COMMISSION OR CITY COUNCIL MEMBER THAT ADAPTED THIS FIRST AD EXPANSION IN 2016 BUT I I THINK IT WAS TOWARDS DIVERSITY OF HOUSING STOCK AND I THINK THAT PUTTING SOME MINIMUM FLOOR ON HOW LONG SOMEBODY IS IN THAT IS ATTEMPTING TO. ENCOURAGE THE DEVELOPMENT OF ACCESSORY DWELLING FOR THAT PRICE. NOT FOR THE SAKE OF ACCESSORY DRAWING BUT RA PROVIDE DIVERSITY OF HOUSING. I'LL REMIND COMMISSIONERS THAT PART OF CONVERSATION AT THAT TIME WAS DECREASING FAMILY HOUSEHOLD SIZE IN OUR COMMUNITY AND LOTS OF COMMUNITIES WITH A SIMPLY SIZE HOUSING STOCK THAT USED TO HOUSE GREATER FAMILY SIZES AND I THINK THE INTENTION WAS THE INTENTION WAS FROM A SUSTAINABILITY PER SPECK I'VE. THIS IS ADDING HOUSING ON WITHIN EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE NETWORKS APPROXIMATE TO JOB CENTERS APPROXIMATE TO EXIST INFRASTRUCTURE, NOT BUILDING NEW ROADS, NO BUILDING NEW PARKING LOTS, DOING DEVELOPING HOUSING UNITS IN A SUSTAINABLE MANNER. IT IS SUSES STAPLE AND REUSING THAT PROPERTY IN A SIMILARLY OCCUPANCY AS MAY HAVE BEEN USED MIST RICKLY BUT NO LONG EVERY. AND MAYBE WOULD BE AFFORDABLE NOT FROM THE LENS THESE ARE E STRICTED FROM INCOME BUT STRICTLY BY GOAL IF A 600 OR 800 SQUARE FOOT UNIT MIGHT BE MORE AFFORDABLE THAN A THOUSAND OR 1100 SQUARE FOOT UNIT IN THE COMMUNITY. NOT THE SAY THEY WON'T BE EXPENSIVE ADU I'M SURE THEY WILL BUT OTHER THOSE REASONS ALL ABOUT DIVERTS ACTIVE HOUSING IS TO BE. THAT'S WHERE THAT CAME FROM.
04:19:32.511: >> IF I MAY. I'M READING THE ROOM NOW WHICH IS A BUNCH OF TIRED EYES. I HAVE A LIST OF THINGS WE PROBABLY -- AND I ALSO HEARD FROM PEOPLE THAT WE SHOULD GET THROUGH. SO I WANT TO PUT THOSE OUT THERE. SEE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER BURNING QUESTIONS. AND THEN MOVE TO POSTPONE. TO A TIME THAT IS NOT SO MANY HOURS PAST MY BEDTIME. IF THAT'S ALL RIGHT WITH YOU ALL. THE THINGS I THINK THAT AT LEAST ON MY LIST WE NEED TO CIRCLE BACK TO ARE ABOUT THE FAMILY DEFINITION. BUT ALSO THE CLARIFICATION THAT'S SOMEONE CALLED IN ABOUT. ON LIKE HOW DOES THIS FIT WITH STR. I THINK I KNOW BUT WOULD LOVE STAFF TO WEIGH IN ON HELPING US UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT WAS. THERE IS A LOT OF COMMUNICATION I WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE PLAN IS FOR THE DOCUMENT MR. LENART THAT YOU HAD BUT ALSO LIKE LET TALK ABOUT THAT. WHAT IS THE OPTION FOR SENDING A BOTH CARD. AND SO THOSE WERE THEN CONTINUING CLEARLY THE DISCUSSION OF OWNER OCCUPANCY IF OTHERS HAVE THE WANT TO WEIGH IN AS WELL AS SOME KIND OF SOME OF THE OTHER CHANGES WE HAVEN'T DISCUSSED MUMP AND I THINK IT IS PROBABLY WORTH KITS US CUSSING THE IDEA OF A ALLOWING OKAY PAPACY IN -- WITHIN THREE FEET OF THE PROPERTY LINE. WHICH IS A MAKE FROM WHERE YOU BUILD THE PRIMARY RESIDENCE.
04:21:12.077: >> I WANTED TO REMIND THE COMMISSION AND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC, WE HAVE RIGHT NOW, THAT IS AN OPPORTUNITY AFFORDED TO PROPERTIES THAT ARE R 1 OR R 2A THAT HAD AN EXISTING ACCESSORY STRUCTURE PRIOR TO DECEMBER 31ST, 2016. WE CAN TRY TO BRING MORE -- I WOULD ACNE LEDGE WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET USE MORE DATA ABOUT WHAT HAPPEN THAT PERCENTAGE IS. THAT'S BEEN A LITTLE MORE CHALLENGING FOR US TO TEASE OUTS OF THE OUR DATA BUT THAT IS SOMETHING WE CAN ASPIRE TO TRY TO AT LEAST FRAME FOR FOR THE NEXT DISCUSSION. I WANT TO UNCLEAR THAT THERE IS SOMETHING PROVISION CURRENTLY. THIS WOULD OPEN THAT POSSIBILITY TO MORE PROPERTIES.  BUT THIS IS NOT ABSOLUTELY ADDING THAT. THAT DOES ECONOMIST WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF CURRENT CODE.
04:21:39.804: >> I WOULD ADD ECHOING WHAT BROUGHT SAID, IF THE YOU ARE IN REASON R 1B YOUR PRINCIPLE STRUCTURE IS THREE FEET FROM STIED ROT LINE. WE ARE TALKING THREE TO FIVE FEET IN R 1C AND D DISTRICTS.
04:21:52.150: >> I THINK HAVING A DISCUSSION OF THAT AND LIKE HAVING THOSE EXAMPLES WILL BE HELPFUL PERSONALLY SO I CAN FEEL LIKE WE TALKED ABOUT IT ADEQUATELY. I SAW COMMISSIONER ABRONS HAND AND COMMISSIONER LEES HAND.
04:22:04.729: >> NEVER MIND MAYBE NOT. AGAIN MAYBE I'M SEEING THINGS. COMMISSIONER LEE THEN COMMISSIONER GIBB RANDAL.
04:22:12.304: >> I WANTED TO VOICE WHAT YOU JUST PUT OUT THERE, THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A BIG DECISION FOR US A AND MAYBE APPROPRIATE TO POSTPONE. I WOULD BE FA IN FAVOR. I THIS YOU MADE A PERFECT LIST OF THINGS ON MY QUESTIONS AS WELL SO ROBUST ENGAGEMENT, OBVIOUS WE HEARD ABOUT WE THINK WE GOT INSUFFICIENT NOTICE. I ALSO WANTED TO BRING UP THE IDEAS OF COULD THERE BE BUILT IN PREMIUMS AND SINTIVES FOR AFFORDABILITY AND ENVIRONMENTALLAL SUSTAINABILITY SO PUT ON IF YOU MAKE -- FOLLOW UP WITHIN A CERTAIN INCOME RANGE TOO TRY TO MAKE SHOE YOU ARE YOU ARE SUPPORTING IS THERE SOMETHING WE CAN ADDITIONALLY DO. THEN THE OTHER THING THAT I WANTED TO BRING UP WAS THIS IS ANECDOTAL. OBVIOUS OBVIOUSLY NET DOTES ARE POWERFUL BUT NOT GENERALIZABLE. BUT ANOTHER THING IS OBVIOUSLY YOU GUYS ARE 21-FOOT HEIGHT RESTRICTION BUT NOT NECESSARILY ONE SIZE FITS ALL. SO WONDERING IF THERE COULD BE SOME KIND OF CONTEXTUAL FACTOR TO IT AND SO I JUST WANT TO THROW THAT OUT BECAUSE I HAVE A CLOSE FRIEND WHO IS IN A DIFFERENT CITY BUT HAD BEAUTIFUL VIEW AND AGAIN IT IS NOT THE FACT THAT WE DON'T WANT TO SEE ANYTHING NOT IN OUR BACKYARD SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES WE WANT TO SEE QUALITY IN OUR BACKYARD. A BIG PROPONENT OF THAT BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE CONTEXTUALLY FIXED SO I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THAT POTENTIALLY COULD LOOK LIKE BUT AGAIN, I THINK THERE IS A HUGE OBVIOUSLY DECISION THAT I WOULD BE IN FAVOR OF POSTPONING. SO I WANTED TO THROW THAT OUT THERE.
04:24:09.621: >> COMMISSIONER GIBB RANDAL.
04:24:15.460: >> I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO THINK ABOUT THAT ISSUE TOO. AND THAT PERHAPS THAT FOR EXISTING STRUCTURE IT COULD STAY THAT WAY BE OCCUPIED THING IS DIFFERENT THAN EMPTY BARRAGE. I DO. AND THAT IT DOES CHANGE FOR SOME OF THE DIFFERENT ZONING DISTRICTS. SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT MAYBE THERE'S SOME SORT OF WORK AROUND THAT ALLOWS SOMETHING THAT LIKE THAT TO HAPPEN. THE OTHER IDEA IS THAT I WOULD BE IN FAVOR OF THE OWNER OCCUPYING THING LIKE GETTING ROLLED OUT THAT. WE -- BECAUSE I THINK IT'S EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO TAKE THAT WAY AND MAYBE MORE ACCEPTABLE TO PEOPLE THAT WAY. AND WE ROLE OUT WITH BEING OWN OWNER OCCUPIED THEN RE-EVALUATE THAT SOMETHING I WOULD SUPPORT. POST CARDS WOULD BE A GOOD THING. PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THIS. WE NEED A ROBES DISCUSSION.
04:25:28.733: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT.
04:25:31.703: >> I'M GOING TO PLUS ONE THE THINGS YOU GUYS MENTION BUT FIRST AND FOREMOST COMMUNICATION LIKE WE HEARD OVER AND OVER AGAIN, I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S OTHER ORDINANCES THAT IMPACT LIKE WHAT SEEMS LIKE THIS BIG OF A SWATH OF THE CITY BUT POST CARDS ARE NOT HARD THING TO DO. I DON'T KNOW WE NEED TOE BRING THIS BACK. BUT CLEAR THE WEBSITE OR JUST CLEAR THIS IS WHAT IS HAPPENING. JOIN THIS DISCUSSION. AT LEAST THEN WE CAN SAY YES DID OUR BEST SEND OUT THE POST CARDS, GET US AS MANY PEOPLE AWARE OF THIS AND ASKS QUESTIONS AS POSSIBLE. COUPLE OF THINGS I WANT TO CIRCLE BACK ON NEXT TIME, I'M STRUGGLING WITH THIS NOT BEING ABLE TO USE ADU AS SHORT TERM RENTAL. IF IF IT IS OWNER OCCUPIED I THINK IT'S MAYBE OKAY. I CAN SEE BOTH SIDES THIS IS SOMETHING I'M STRUGGLING WITH I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE DISCUSSION ABOUT NEXT TIME PLUS TWO ON THE SET BACK ISSUE. PLUS ONE ON THE INCENTIVE I WAS THINKING ABOUT THAT TOO. SUSTAINABILITY AND APPEAREDDIBILITY IS INTERESTING. CHICAGO HAS PILOT ADU ORDINANCE AND THIS IS A LOT OF DISCUSSION AND I THINK CONCERN WHAT HAPPENS IF QUESTION ELIMINATE OWNER OKAY PAN SANE THOSE WITH BEING BUILT ACROSS THE LOT LINES. CHICAGO IS IN THEIR PILOT PROGRAMS CAPPING PERMITS LIKE LOTS SO I DON'T KNOW IF THAT IS SOMETHING THAT HAVE BEEN TALKED ABOUT MAYBE THERE IS AN ANNUAL NUMBER BY WARD OR SOMETHING THAT COULD BE DISTRIBUTED SO THEY ARE NOT -- I DON'T NECESSARILY SEE THIS HAPPENING. BUT SO THAT YOU DOPE HAVE THIS HUGE INFLUX OF ADU HAPPENING IN ONE STREET. THE IN THIS CASE THE CALMER WROUGHT UP THAT COMMISSIONER MILLS WAS TALKING ABOUT IF YOU GUILD AN AD UK BUT USE IT IN YOUR FAMILY YOU WOULD BE NECESSARILY BE SEPARATING RENTAL INCOME SO WHAT THE TAX IMPLICATIONS OF THAT. BUT STILL NOT COUNT AS PART OF YOUR HOMESTEAD, IF YOU RENT OUT, DO COUNT AS COMES OFF YOUR HOMESTEAD EXEMPTION SO -- THAT SEEMS TO ME LE A LIKELY USE ENARIO TO BUILD SOMETHING FOR A FAMILY MEMBER. NOT NECESSARILY CHARGE THEM REPRESENT. SO TALKING THROUGH THAT. I THINK THAT'S IT. THANK YOU. COMMISSIONER MILLS FOR SUGGESNG THAT WE JUST POSTPONE BECAUSE THIS IS TOO IMPORTANT OF O A THING FOR US EXHAUSTED PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAVE A COHERENT DISCUSSION ABOUT.
04:27:55.613: >> COMMISSIONER CLARKE. TRILLIONS
04:27:59.684: >> I JUST HAVE A QUICK QUESTION TO MAKE SURE I'M UNDERSTANDING RIGHT WITH THE THREE FOOD ON THE SIDE SET BACKS. SO MY GARAGE IS LIKE THREE FOOT FROM SET BACKS SO DIDN'T REALIZE THAT WASN'T ALLOWED RIGHT NOW, IT WAS LIKE THAT SOMETHING CHANGED OR WHATEVER SO IS THIS SUGGESTING THAT NEW LIKE A NEW FOUNDATION WOULD BE LAID THREE FEED FROM A SET BACK. BUTHAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S CURRENT WHETHER I NOT ALOUD IN OUR R 1?
04:28:24.108: >> OR R 1 -- (INAUDIBLE) (INAUDIBLE) (INAUDIBLE) OWLEDGE KNOWLEDGE (INAUDIBLE) (INAUDIBLE). I'M CURIOUS ABILITY THAT. SET BACK AND NEW FOUNDATION.
04:28:34.886: >> TO BE CLEAR, FOR ACCESRY ILDINGS, OUR CODE REQUIRES ACCEORY BUILDING TO BE THREE FEET FROM THE PROPERTY RR AND SIDE PROPEY LINES AND CAN'T REQUIRED REAR SET BACK.ENT O VERSUSOING TOIGITALLY STO ON MYOESF I GET ANYTHG WRON IF YOUAVE UNDER AS THAT RELATES  ACCESSO DWEING UNITS RIGHT NOW,HE W DINANCE IS STRUCTUD IF YOU STRUCTURE AT MEETS THOSE THR SQUARE FOO IN SIZ ACCESRY0 THE PROPERTYINE, YOU COULD MOLISH THAT AND BUILDING A NEW STRUCTURE THREE FEET FROM THE PROPERTY LINE. IF YOU DID NOT HAVE THAT GARAGE, IN ANY OF THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES, BY AS OF DECEMBER 3 SEARCH AND SEIZURE OF 2016 ACCESSORY DOING.
04:29:37.148: >> YOU ARE ELIGIBLE. I IN ADDITION TO YOUR HOUSE, SOMEWHERE IN THE INTERIOR OF YOUR HOUSE, THAT WOULD BE ELIGIBLE BUT NOT BE ELIGIBLE TOSS THAT'S NOT A NEW REQUIREMENTS IT IS A REQUIREMENT THAT WE HAVE TAKEN FROM BUILD,WHICH COULD BE A GARAGE OR SHED OR VARIETY OF OTHER THINGS, AND APPLY THAT IN THIS CASE TO ALLOY ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS TO MEET THE SAME.
04:30:09.814: >> CHANGING USE OF EXISTING STRUCTURE BUT NOT CONSTRUCTING THE BRAND NEW STRUCTURE WITHIN THREE FEET.
04:30:16.654: >> HOWEVER THIS PROPOISED ORDINANCE OPENS UP THAT POSSIBILITY OF ANY STRUCTURE TO PROPERTIES THAT DIDN'T HAVE A GARAGE PREVIOUSLY.
04:30:24.929: >> THANK YOU.
04:30:32.537: >> I ANYTHING ELSE WE WANT TO PUT ON THE LIST THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE DISCUSS NEXT TIME AROUND? COMMISSIONER LEE.
04:30:42.447: >> I WOULD LIKE CLARIFICATION ON THAT. THE PROPERTY TAX ASSESSMENT AS WELL THE UTILITY ISSUE. WHAT IS THAT MEAN. I THINK CLARITY THIS NCI THOSE GUIDELINES WILL HELP IMPLEMENTATION. I DON'T WANT TO THROW UP ANOTHER COMPLEXITY WITH -- BUT I THINK THAT EXPLANATION WILL GO A LONG WAY FOR PEOPLE HAVING VERY CLEAR EXPECTATION WHAT TO EXPECT MOVING FORWARD. SO THAT WOULD BE MY ONLY REQUEST. THANK YOU.
04:31:17.014: >> GIVEN THE LONG LIST WE LAYED OUT YOU CANOR YOU CAN SHOOT DAGGERS WITH YOUR EYES BUT I SUGGEST WE TAKE THIS UP AND THE NEXT REGULAR MITING. WHEN WE DO HAVE ANYTHING ELSE ON THE AGENDA SO WE CAN TALK ABOUT IT AT 7 O'CLOCK RATHER THAN 11: 30. SO SADIRA.
04:31:36.067: >> IS THERE TIME TO DO POST CARDS AND EVERYTHING?
04:31:42.440: >> OPERATOR:  IF YOU COULD ADDRESS THAT. IF THAT IS AGILE, I WOULD NEED MORE TIME TO FIRST SEE IF I CAN TO THAT. I DON'T I'M HAPPY TO PURSUE THAT AND I HOPE THAT THERE IS A WAY WE CAN GET THERE. I FRANKLY DON'T HAVE THAT IN MY BUDGET TO SAY YES WE WILL DO THAT. WHEN YES DOING ORDINANCE AMENDMENTS SUCH AS THIS ONE WHILE IT MIGHT HAVE AN IMPACT ACROSS MANY PROPERTIES IT IS A TEXT AMENDMENT TO OUR ZONING ORDINANCE. AND BY PRACTICE WE DON'T SEND OUTPOST CARDS TO EVERY PROPERTY OWNER THAT MIGHT BE IMPACTED. SIMILARLY WE DID NOT SEND OUTPOST CARDS TO EVERY PROPERTY OWNER WHEN WE ADOPTED THE UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE THAT WAS A SORT OF A MORE BROAD READOPTION OF OUR ENTIRE SEWN ZONING CODE. I WILL PURSUE HA AS OPTION. I DON'T THINK IT MAKES SENSE IN A TWO WEEK TEAM PERIOD. I CAN'T ANSWER THAT QUESTION AND GET THEM PRODUCED AND MAILED AN SENT IN ENOUGH ADEQUATE TIME FOR THAT. I WOULD BASED ON THE COMMENTS ON THIS PREVIOUSLY I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THAT WE HAVE DONE A LOT MORE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT THIS PROPOSED AMENDMENT WE BROADLY ADVERTISE THE WORKING SESSION. YOU'LL RECALL WE DID THE WORKING SESSION A LITTLE DIFFERENT MANNER THAN TYPICAL BROADLY ADVERTISED IN PRESS RELEASES, SOCIAL MEDIA, OUR TYPICAL PLANNING EMAIL DELIVERIES OF INTERESTED PARTIES WHICH I THINK IS LIKE 13 OR 14 OR SAW HUNDRED PEOPLE, SOMETHING LIKE THAT. WAS ALSO PUBLISHED OF COURSE WE HELD BACK, FOUR AS IS TYPICAL EVERY MEETING WHETHER THE PLANNING COMMISSION ORDINANCE REVISION COMMITTEE WORKING SESSION, ALL AGENDAINGS ARE SHARED TO THAT SAME EMAIL LIST. SO I ALWAYS ENCOURAGE ANYBODY INTERESTED TO CHECK OUT CITY WEBSITE, SIGN UP FOR UPDATES. THEN IN RESPONSE TO CONVERSATIONS THAT ORDINANCE REVISION COMMITTEE MEETING THOSE WERE RAISED AGAIN, SO IN ADDITION TO OUR MORE ROUTINE PUBLICATION WE DID THE SAME FOR THIS PUBLIC HEARING WE DID PRESS RELEASE SOCIAL MEDIA RELEASE, ATTEMPTING TO GET IS THAT WORD OUT. BROADLY. THAT IS NOT THE TO SAY I WON'T PURR SO THE POST CARDS, I WILL HAVE -- BE HAPPY TO PURSUE THAT, IF SORE SOME REASON I CAN'T ACCOMPLISH THATLY LET YOU KNOW OR CHOOSE NOT THE ACCOMPLISH IT WILL LET NOW KNOW BUT I NEED MORE TIME THAN THAT TWO WEEK TO ACCOMPLISH THAT FOR U. IF THAT SOMETHING THAT COMMISSION REALLY FEELS STRONGLY ABOUT, THAT SHOULD HAPPEN, THAT IS A A TYPICAL FROM TYPICAL PROCESS, NOT SO DAY WE CAN'T DO IT. I WOULD SUGGEST TARGET APRIL 6 MEETING FOR THAT DISUS CUSHION. THE CITY COUNCIL ASKED FOR BACK ON TRANSIT ZONING ON YOUR WORK PLAN YOU IDENTIFIED TACKLING ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS BEFORE GETTING INTO THE TRANSIT ZONING. AS SORT OF A PRIORITIZATION. WE DO NEED TO ATTEMPT TO GET THE TRANSIT ZONING RECOMMENDATIONS TO CITY COUNCIL BY JUNE. OF THIS YEAR. SO I WOULD JUST KEEP THAT IN MIND I WOULD SAY THAT IS MIGHT JUST START SQUEEZING THAT TIME IF YOU WANT TO BE FAITHFUL TO THAT ORDER.
04:35:51.589: >> I WILL ADD TO DISCUSSION THAT THE FIRST TIME BACK IN 2016 THERE WAS NOT A POST ACD THAT WENT OUT ON ADU. DOESN'T MEAN THAT DOESN'T HAVE TO THIS TIME. COMMISSIONER DISCH.
04:36:08.272: >> I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT PROCEDURE TO NOT NEED TO ASK THIS QUESTION BUT IS THERE A PLAN -- SO A LOT OF WHAT WAS JUST LISTED IS I THINK REALLY IMPORTANT AND GREAT STUFF TO TALK ABOUT. COULD IT NOT BE DONE AT OUR NEXT WORK SESSION.
04:36:33.364: >> DO WE HAVE SOMETHING UP FOR THAT.
04:36:36.100: >> YEAH. IF WE WANTED TO DO THAT I GUESS I WOULD ASK FOR COMMISSION TO DESIRE WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO PUSH BACK AS RELATES TO SITE PLAN REVIEW THRESHOLDS OR TRANSIT ZONING.
04:36:51.782: >> AMONG THE REASONS I THINK WE MIGHT WANT TO DISCUSS IT AT A FIRST OR THIRD TUESDAY IS SO THAT WE CAN EFFECT ACTIVELY CONTINUE THE PUBLIC HEARING. OFTEN WHEN WE DO THIS THERE IS NOT A SUBSTANTIVE CHANGE BETWEEN WHAT WE HEARD TODAY. WE DIDN'T ASK STAFF TO CHANGE ANYTHING. SO IT'S THE SAME ORDINANCE TOO P REPRODUCIBILITY ARE ARE TOO P COO REPRODUCIBILITY ARE ARE IF THEY SPOKE ON THE IN ORDER NANS WE ARE DISCUSSING THAT WE HAVEN'T FINISHED DISCUSSIONING, THEY WOULDN'T MAKE THE SAME COMMENTS ON IT LIKE WE WOULDN'T OPEN IT FOR THEM. IT WOULD BE FOR ANY NEW FOLKS. IS THE TYPICAL PROCEDURE. BUT BECAUSE WE ARE IN -- THIS IS -- WE HAVE A PUBLIC HEARING ABOUT THIS I THINK WE NEED TO -- WE WANT TO KEEP IT IN THAT TRACK. THAT FAIR?
04:37:42.700: >> SHOULD STAND IN REGULAR MEETING. WOULDN'T CONTINUATION OF PUBLIC HEARING.
04:37:54.478: >> I WOULD SUGGESTED ONE OF TWO OPTIONS POSTPONE TO MARCH 16 TORQUE GET AS MANY ANSWER AS AS POSSIBLE AND DO SAME ROUTE REACH WE DID IN ADVANCE OF THIS MEETING. WHERE WE WILL LIKELY DO ANOTHER PRESS RELEASE SOCIAL MEDIA, E MATE BLASTS, IT WOULD NOT BE POST CARDS TO EVERY PROPERTY. IF THAT IS DESIRED, I GUESS I WOULD APPRECIATE THAT DIRECTION AND I CAN TRY TO ACCOMPLISH THAT. I CAN'T PROMISE IT BUT I CAN TRIAL TO ACCOMPLISH IT. AND THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE AT LEAST APRIL 6 I THINK TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE TIME FRAME FOR THAT. PRINTING MAILING, AND JUST THE FRANKLY TIME RIGHT NOW AND MAILING SYSTEM FOR THEM TO GET THERE IN ADVANCE OF THE MEETING. I WOULD SUGGEST THOSE OPTIONS.
04:38:47.197: >> ABRONS.
04:38:49.133: >> I WOULD LIEGE TO KNOW MORE ABOUT WHETHER THE POST CARD IS POSSIBLE. BEFORE WE COMMIT TO NOT DOING THE POST CARD.
04:38:56.607: >> I WOULD BE IN FAVOR OF APRIL DATE. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT DATE IS ALREADY FULL OF OTHER STUFF. I THINK THE GOAL IS TO HAVE OFTEN A DATE ON A LIGHT AGENDA OR AGENDA WE HAVE TIME THE DIG IN. Z
04:39:17.728: >> I WAS CONSIDERING DE DEPEND ON ORGANIZING SESSION I WAS PLANNING ON BRINGING TRANSIT ZONING TO THAT MEETING I WOULD LIKELY PUSH ONE OR BOTH FROM THAT IF WITH THAT. Z THAT MAKES SENSE IF WE PUSH THAT METHODDING THAT GIVES ME THE FLEXIBILITY TO TAKE THE MAILING NOTES AS FAR AS I POSSIBLY CAN BASED ON YOUR DESIRE. ISH
04:39:51.528: >> WDERING WHAT WE HOPE TO GAIN. PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT IS REALLY IMPORTANT BUT THIS SEEM LIKE THERE IS HAS BEEN A LOT SO FAR AND I WAS FOLLOWING YOUR ORDINANCE PROVISION MEETING AND LOT OVERALERT USEFUL INFORMATION ANDEEN IN DISCUSSION AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE ARE NOT ENTENG THE TERRITORY OF OPINION COLLECTING WITHOUT THE SYNTHESIZING OF WE HAVE CAPTURED A PRETTY BROAD RANGE OF EPIPUT AND I GUESS I WOULD BE CURIOUS TO SEE IFHERE WAS SPECIFIC MAYBE COMMUNITIES THAT COULD MAYBE THERE COULD BE DIRECT OUTREACH TO COMMUNITIES WE MIGHT THINK MIGHT NOT HAVE GOTTEN THE WILL EBB TROPIC MESSAGE MAYBE SENIOR GROUPS SOMETHING WE CAN PUT THE WORD OUT THAT WAY. BUT SENDING THE MAILER TO EVERYBODY IN THE CITY TO ME STEEMS LIKE SINCE THERE IS NOT A IT DOESN'T I GUESS IF IT DID TURN OUTHE WAY IN THE PAST FOR SIMILAR THINGS I WLD CHANGE MY MIND BUT BUT I WANT THE MAKE SURE WE ARE NOT GETTING IN TERRITORY OF OPINION WITHOUT ANALYZING ATOME POINT WE HA TO SAY WE HAV HEARD WHOLEANGE AND FIGURING WT THAT POINT IS.

04:42:21.945: >> I JUST THINK THAT REALLY THE AGAIN, I AM ALWAYS FOR MORE ENGAGEMENT BUT I THINK THE BENEFIT GAINED FROM SENDING IT OUT, THE FOLKS THAT CARE ABOUT THIS, THINK ARE ENGAGED OPENFULLY OUT TO GET MORE MEANINGFUL ENGAGEMENT I HAVE THE POSTPONEMENT IS NOT, IT IS MAINLY BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT IT DESERVES MORRIS ATTENTION THAN US HAVING WORKED 16 HOURS, SO I'M GOING IN FAVOR OF SIMPLY SAYING WITH QUESTION JUST TABLE THIS TO MARCH 16TH. THAT WOULD BE MY MOTION. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S SOMETHING EPIC JUST MAKE AND BRING AND SEE HOW THE VOTE GOES.
04:43:07.357: >> COMMISSIONER MR. LENART.
04:43:13.330: >> JUST MEMBER OF OUR AUDIENCE JUST SENT EMAIL RYAN FROM M LIVE THAT OVER 50,000 PEOPLE HAVE READ THE STORY THAT WAS POSTED IN REGARDS TO THIS. SO I THINK THERE IS A LOT OF AWARENESS OUT THERE.

04:44:04.214: >> I WOULD AID WE WILL WORK TO ADVERTISE THIS AND SEND OUT NOISE IT IS AND PRESS RELEASE, WHEN OUR WEBSITE IS ACTIVE. SO I BY NOT DOING POST CARDS NOT THAT WE WILL NOT ENDEAVOR TO SHARE THIS CONTINUATION WIDE LIVE. SO I JUST TRAIN THAT FOR YOUR ACCORDANCE.
04:44:26.103: >> COMMISSIONER ABRONS. I WANTED TO SAY I THINK I HAVE CHANGE METHOD MIND. I SUPPORT THAT. MOTION.
04:44:33.543: >> ANY OTHER DISCUSSION.
04:44:35.479: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT. I DON'T NOT SUPPORT IT FOR ME IT'S LESS ABOUT GETTING MORE ENGAGEMENT, NOT ENGAGEMENT, OF COURSE I DO BUT MORE ABOUT GREAT 50,000 PEOPLE READ THE ARTICLE. THAT'S FANTASTIC. I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THIS IS COULD POTENTIALLY BE A THING THAT LIKE IMPACTS PEOPLE AND THEY HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA. I THINK I WOULD BE OKAY BRINGING THIS PACK TO NEXT ONE TWO WEEKS. BUT STILL LIKE TO EXPLORE POST CARD MORE LIKE A HEY. THIS IS CHANGING IT WILL GO TO CITY COUNCIL. THROW THE T 1 THING ON THERE FOR FOR THE 20,000 PEOPLE GETTING THE POST CARD. IT'S GOOD TO HAVE MULTIPLE LEVELS OF OUTRECHEAT PEOPLE CLEARLY GOT THE SNOW REMOVAL POST CARDS AND READ THEM. IF IT'S AT ALL POSSIBILITY, I JUST DON'T SEE THE HARM. IN STILL TRYING TO DO THE POSTCARD.
04:45:34.638: >> I AGREE WITH BOTH, LOAD TICK TALK ABOUT THIS PERSONALLY ONLY THE 16TH BUT POST CARD THAT GOES OUT BEFORE IT GETS TO COUNCIL BECAUSE IT HAD TO GO TO COUNCIL, WOULD STILL BE BENEFICIAL. IF IT THE POST CARD IS LIKE LOOK AT THESE THINGS THOSE CRAZY PLANNING COMMISSARS ARE DOING. YOU CAN DO IN YOUR OWN BACKYARD.
04:45:57.160: >> YOU CAN DO IN YOUR OWN BACKYARD. LOOK AT THAT.
04:46:00.364: >> YOU KNOW ABOUT THESE STR REGULATIONS. ANY OTHER DISCUSSION. SO WE ARE DISCUSSING POSTPONING THIS TO TWO WEEKS FROM TODAY. (INAUDIBLE) BEFORE THAT. MARCH 16TH. WE CAN VOTE -- JUST ALL IN FAVOR OF THAT POSTPONE -- OF THAT POSTPONEMENT THEN WE ARE DONE. DISCUSSING THAT FOR NOW. WE WILL TALK ABOUT IT IN TWO WEEKS. AND AS WE DICES CUTTED SO YOU CAN TELL YOUR FRIENDS IF THEY CALLED IN AND TALKED THIS TIME AROUND IT WON'T HAVE CHANGED BETWEEN NOW AND THEN SO THEY CAN STILL PROVIDE A PUBLIC COMMENT AT THE END OF THE MEETING. BUT THERE WILL HAVE A PUBLIC HEARING WE'LL CONTINUE THE PUBLIC HEARING TOKER ANYONE WHO VIN HAVE A CHANCE TO -- DIDN'T HAVE HA CHANCE TO SPEAK. THAT'S THE NORMAL PROCESS, RIGHT MR. LENART?
04:46:57.788: >> THAT WAS HISTORICALLY BUT YOU HAD AS COMMISSIONER HAD EVOLVED THAT TO JUST OPEN UP PUBLIC HEARING GENERAL LIVE. IT'S AT YOUR DISCRETION. IF THE MENTION INTENTION IS VOICES, T AT THIS POINT ONLY ONE ITEM IF FOLKS WANTED TO REPEAT. TRILLIONS I DON'T SEE IF HARM PERSONALLY. FROM THE I'LL LEAVE THAT TO -- THE COMMISSION DISCRETION.
04:47:30.053: >> WHICH ARE NOW BACK TO PUBLIC COMMENT. WE ARE STILL ON -- SO THAT WAS SPUE POSTPONED WE ARE ON NUMBER INTO PUBLIC COMMENT. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PERSONS TO SPEAK FOR UP TO THREE MINUTES ABOUT ANY ITEM OF INTEREST PUBLIC COMMENT CAN BE MADE BY CALLING 87 -- AND ENTERING MEETING ID 929 O 16202435. YOU CAN RAISE YOUR HAND BY PRESSING STAR NINE ON YOUR PHONE AND MR. LENART WILL LET YOU KNOW WHEN IT IS YOUR TURN TO SPEAK.
04:48:10.627: >> THIS IS RALPH MCKEY 1116 RED OAK. THE AFFORDABILITY ASH ISSUE WITH RESPECT TO, A, THED.  THERE WAS A NUMBER OF COMMENTS THAT STILL I THINK ARE PERPETRATING A FICTION HERE. AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF COMMENTS ABOUT WHAT IT WOULD COST TO BUILD ONE CALLER SAID 200,000, SOME OTHER NUMBERS AROUND THAT SAME ZONE. THAT IS PROBABLY ACCURATE. THINK ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS. IF YOU HAVE GOT A $200,000 THING PRESUMABLY GOT TO PAY SOME LOAN INTEREST OVER FEATS HIGHER THAN THAT. IF YOU GIT -- IF YOU ARE A LANDLORD YOU WANT 10% RETURN IF THAT MEANS 21 GRANDER SOMETHING LIKE THAT NET, YOU ARE EXPENSES ARE MAYBE SOME MONEY FOR PROPERTY MANAGEMENT MAYBE SOME MINOR REPAIRS MAYBE YOU GOT TO PAY PROPERTY TAXES ON THAT. THAT'S 50 MILLS AT HUNDRED GRAND MAYBE ANOTHER FAWN P FIVE THAT THE' $27,000. GROSS YOU HAVE TO GET. 2250 A MONTH BEFORE EWE UNTIL AT THIS. IN MIGHT BE WHO WHO WANTS TO CALL THAT AFFORDABLE IS DELUSIONAL IN MY VIEW. AND THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE GETTING. SO THIS WHOLE CONCEPT AND THE REASON I RAISE THE MATH, SAME THING HAPPENED WITH AFFORDABILITY WITHIN RESPECT TO THE QUAD PRESENTATION IN A 2O IN THE ORIGINAL PLAN IT SAID THIS WILL ENHANCE AFFORDABLEIBILITY. I DID THE SAME MATH AND AT THIS CITY TO HER CREDIT PACKED OFF AND SAID I GUESS IT ISN'TN'T SO IT REALLY BOTHERSOME WHEN YOU ARE ASSUMING THAT THIS IS A GOING TO CREATE AFFORDABILITY WHEN IN FACT IT IS NOT. IT JUST ZN'T. THAT'S THE MATH. YOU HAVE GOT PLENTY OF REAL ESTATE PROFESSIONALS HERE:  MY MATH MAYBE THERE'S PIECES OF IT YOU CAN QUIBBLE ABOUT WHAT THE INDIVIDUAL NUMBERS WERE WHAT THE PERCENTAGES ARE, BUT THE -- SOMEBODY HAS TO DO THIS MATH. THAT'S IN A POSITION OF MAKING A DECISION BEFORE YOU START ANNOUNCING THIS IS PER SE AFFORDABLE BECAUSE THAT IS WRONG. UNLESS I I'M COMPLETELY OFF BASE ON THE MATH, IT IS LATE AT NIGHT. MAYBE I MADE AN ERROR CERTAINLY POSSIBLE BUT I DON'T THINK SO. THAT NEEDS TO BE FOCUS OF WHAT YOU ARE DOING. YOU CANNOT FEEL WITH THESE ITEMS IN THE ABSTRACT ALL THE TIME. THE SAME PRINCIPLES APPLY TO TRANSIT ORIENT DEVELOPMENT AND THESE OTHER CONCEPTS PLEASE BEFORE YOU START -- AFFORDABILITY AROUND THAT YOU REALLY THINK ABOUT WHETHER THAT REALLY EXISTS.  IN VANCOUVER BUNCH OF PEOPLE MAYBE MORE
04:51:16.880: >> THANK YOU. TIP PEOPLE OPT LINE. IF YOU WOULD LIME TO SPEAK RAID YOUR HAND SO WE CAN GET YOU IN IF QUEUE.
04:51:45.408: >> THIS IS JEFF CROCKETT I HOPE BECAUSE YOU DELAY YOUR RELOOKING AT THIS A IN A COUPLE OF WEEK THAT ENFORCEMENT OF THIS ORDINANCE BECOMES DISCUSSION POINTS. TO HAVE ORBED NANS WITHOUT AN ENTOERS. PLAN. THE OTHER THING TO MENTION IS THAT PLANNING THERE IS A LOT OF STUFF GOING ON IN THE CITY THAT INVOLVES MONITORING AND ENS FOR. AT THE SAME TIME YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT 5 PERT CUTS IN DEPARTMENTS IN HEIGHT OF DIVISIONAL LOAD ENFORCEMENT DOES THIS MEAN THAT YOU ARE GOING TO CUT THE ENFORCEMENT THAT GOES WITH ALL THESE NEW INITIATIVES, IT NEEDS TO BE DISCUSSED SO THANK YOU BUT I CERTAINLY HOPE THAT ENFORCEMENT WILL BE ON THE AGENDA NEXT MEET MEETING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR CONSIDERATIONFUL
04:52:53.143: >> THANK YOU. PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 534. CALLER WITH PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 534. THREE MINUTES.
04:53:13.096: >> THIS IS (INAUDIBLE) AGAIN. THERE'S SOME POINT RAISED THAT ARE WORTH FURTHER DISCUSSION. ONE FROM ANOTHER CAMMER I BELIEVE RALPH MCKEY EARLIER ON FOSING ON THE SET BACKS. SO WE CAN RECNIZE AN EXISTIN SE BACK FOR GARAGE IS LEE FEE TA IS ACCESRY STRUCTURE BUT TH DOESN'T MEAN ACCSORY DWELNG IS --OLD ONES CAN BEONVERTEDO ACCESSORY DWELLI UNIT FINEUT IT DON'T MEAN NEW ACCSORY DWELLINGS VE TO BADHERING TO SAME THREE FOOTTANDARD. U CAN S A DIFFERENT STANDARD. YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE IT ALL THE WAY BACK. TO THE REAR YARD THREE FEET AND I'M UNDERSTANDING THERE'S PRACTICAL ISSUES SO MIGHT WILL THETH NOT BE TO THREE NEAT BUT COULD BE ON THE SIDE EASILY. RALPH SUGGESTED DIFFERENT NUMBERS, BUT AT LEAST HAVE A CONVERSATION ABILITY IT. BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE TO MATCH THE THREE FEET. THE OTHER THING THAT I LIKE TO THINK AGAIN ABOUT IS WHAT THE IMPACT OF THIS S. I DO NOT AGREE THAT WE SHOULD SIMPLY SAY OH WE WANT MORE ADU AND THAT'S THE GOAL. THAT IS NOT A GOAL. THAT DOESN'T SERVE ANY PURPOSE: IT WAS JUST SOMETHING ON AL BOARD TO POINT TO. WHAT ARE OUR COMMUNITY GOALS. THIS REALLY WILL REPLACE HAVE MORE REP TALL UNITS AND LESS OWN OWNER OCCUPIED UNITS, PARTICULARLY IT WILL BE HOMEOWNERS TRY DOING TO BUY OTHER END OUTD BY BY INVESTORS. A INVESTORS WILL PAY CASH AND HOME BUYER OPT LORER OFFEND MARKET WILL BE SHUT OUT BEING ABLE TO BUY. THE PRICE OF BOLL END OF THE MARKET IS GOING TO ALSO BE DRIVEN UP DRAMATICALLY. SO THAT EXACERBATES THE PROBLEM AND MULTIPLY T PIPE WHOLE AMOUNT TO BUY MODEST HOME, RELATIVE NUMBER IN ANN ARBOR OR VANCOUVER. BUT WHOEVER THOSE PEOPLE ARE, TRYING TO BUY THE MODEST IN THE MARKET. WILL BE INVESTORS AND WILL MOVE TO PIE A MOMENT SOMEWHERE ELSE AND WHEREVER THEY MIGHT GO TO FIGHT A PLACE TO BUY A HOUSE AND COMMUTE BACK. SO THERE REALLY -- AN IMPACT TO WHAT WE ARE DOING AND IT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN JUST SAYING WELL WE ONLY HAVE 23 AD AND WE WANT A HUNDRED.
04:56:47.010: >> I THOUGHT THE SUGGEST ABOUT PILOT PROGRAM WAS BRILLIANT. ALLOW IT IS COMMUNITY GOAT USED TO IDEA AND SEE IMPACT AND SEE IF IT DOES DRIVE HOMEOWNERS OUT OF TOWN AND SEE FIT DOES AFFECT THE LOW END OF MARKET. CALL IT ON THE LINE, CALLER WITH PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 309. CALLER WITH PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 309. UNPUT YOUR FOIN AND ADDRESS THE PLAN COMMISSION. (INDISCERNIBLE) DIS. YOUR AUDIO WENT NOT SO GREAT.
04:58:13.429: >> IT SOUND LIKE YOU ARE TALKING THROUGH A TUB CAN.
04:58:18.234: >> CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW?
04:58:20.069: >> YES.
04:58:20.770: >> WE CAN.
04:58:21.938: >> OKAY. I TRIED TO CALL IN EARLIER WITH THE CONVERSATION. (INAUDIBLE) I'M GOING TO TURN MY VOLUME DOWN ON THE OF. I JUST I THEY TOOK OFF THE PHONE NUMBER, I COULDN'T GET IN THERE. I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT A COUPLE OF PEOPLE WERE SAYING YOU WERE WAITING ON DATA FOR STL AND THEY ACTUALLY HAD A CONSULTANT WHO CITY SPENT THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS ON AND WE GOT DATA ON NUMBER OF CURRENT STR AND IF ANYTHING GONE DOWN FROM 2019 AND 20 BECAUSE OF THE COVID SITUATION. MR. LENART SAID A THOUSAND UNITS BUT THERE WERE ACTUALLY FROM EVERYTHING I READ IT WAS 131 NON-OWNER OCCUPIED UNITS THEY IDENTIFIED AND THERE ARE 50,000 HUGHESING UNITS IN ANN ARBOR SO I DON'T SEE IT AS A HUGE PUSHING THE AFFORDABILITY ISSUE. THAT IS THE MAIN THING I WANTED TO SAY. THERE'S BEEN DATA A. THERE'S BEEN PUBLIC MEETINGS THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR 18 MONTHS SINCE FALL OF 2019. NOW IT'S BEEN STARTED HAPPENING, THIS HAS BEEN ONGOING. WE DO HAVE SOME DATA ON THIS. THIS IS NOT -- SO. I'M A LITTLE TIRE BUD THAT'S ALL I WANTED TO SAY. THANK YOU.
04:59:58.968: >> THANK YOU.
