00:02:01.573: >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ITEM 3 IS INTRODUCTIONS. ARE THERE ANY TONIGHT, WILL LENART?
00:02:08.814: >> THERE ARE NOT.
00:02:10.015: >> THEN TO ITEM 4 H APPROVAL OF THE AGENDA. CAN I HAVE A MOTION TO MOVE APPROVE AGENDA MOVED BY COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN, SECONDED COMMISSIONER ABRAMS. ANY DISCUSSION MR. LENART IN?

FRIENDLY AMENDMENTS VERY GOOD. ANY OTHER DISCUSSION OF THE AGENDA? TO ALL THOSE IN FAVOR OF THE AGENDA AS AMENDED PLEASE SAY AYE OR RAISE YOUR HAND. (CHORUS OF AYES)
00:02:53.759: >> ANY OPPOSED? NO ONE. SO THAT MOTION CARRIES. SO WE'LL SKIP OVER THE MOTION -- MINUTES OF THE PREVIOUS MEETING AND GO TO ITEM 6. WHICH IS REPORTS FROM CITY ADMINISTRATION CITY COUNCIL PLANNING MANAGER PLANNING COMMISSION OFFICERS AND COMMITTEES AND WRITTEN COMMUNICATIONS. COUNCIL MEMBER DISCH, DO YOU HAVE A REPORT?
00:03:17.583: >> UNLESS MR. LENART WANTS TO CORRECT ME HI DON'T BECAUSE COUNCIL DIDN'T MEET LAST NIGHT.
00:03:28.160: >> EXCELLENT. THIS IS THE FIRST TUESDAY OF THE MONTH. IT IS NOT YET THE FIRST MONDAY. EXACTLY ALL RIGHT. MR. LENART.
00:03:38.771: >> I DO HAVE COUPLE OF ITEMS TO TOUCH ON. ONE A LITTLE LONGER THAN USUAL. I SHARED WITH YOU EARLIER THIS EVENING A DRAFT OF POST COMMUNICATION THAT I WOULD -- WILL BE ASKING FOR PLANNING COMMISSION CONSIDERATION OF YOUR FOLLOWING MEETING ON DECEMBER 15TH. IN RESPONSE TO THE CITY COUNCIL DIRECTION TO LOOK AT SITE PLAN REVIEW THRESHOLDS FOR SMALL AND MODEST PROJECTS. SO I WANTED TO I THINK MOST SHOULD BE AT THIS POINT PRETTY FAMILIAR. BUT I WANTED TO PUBLICLY PRESENT IT TO YOU AND SO YOU HAVE IT IN THE HANDS OF, THE PUBLIC HAS THAT INFORMATION AVAILABLE AS WELL. ALSO SHARED WITH STAKEHOLDER ADVISORY COMMITTEE AS WELL. ALL LEADING TOWARD YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THE NEXT MEETING AND COMMUNICATION OF YOUR INTENTIONS AS THE PLANNING COMMISSION TO UNDERTAKE PROPOSED CHANGES THAT RELATE TO THE UDC PARTICULARLY IN THE COMING YEAR. SO THE COMMUNICATION WILL INCLUDE SOME OTHER BACKGROUND THAT IS RESPONSIVE TO THE ORIGINAL DIRECTION FROM THE CITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION AS TO SOME OF THE OVERALL VOLUME AND HISTORY OF SITE PLANS OVER THE PAST YEARS HERE IN THE CITY. COUPLE OF HIGHLIGHTED COMPARISON COMMUNITIES, BY NO MEANS IS IT A COMMUNICATION COMPREHENSIVE COMPARISON OF OTHER ORDINANCES BUT RATHER A COUPLE OF HIGHLIGHTED PROVISIONS OF OTHER MICHIGAN COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY APPROACH THINGS IN A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT MANNER THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED AS MODEL. SO BUT THE MEAT OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE COMMUNICATION ARE WHAT PROPOSED CHANGES TO OUR ORDINANCE SHOULD BE CONSIDERED FOR SMALL AND MODEST SITE PLAN PROJECTS. AND SO I WANTED TO PRESENT THOSE, AGAIN YOU HAVE SEEN VERSIONS AT THE WORKING SESSION AT THE ORC. MY INTENTION IS TO FINALIZE FORMAT AND CONTENT OF THESE AS A COMMUNICATION TO CITY COUNCIL LATER THIS MONTH. FIRST IS TO EXPLORE THE EXPANSION OF ACTIVITY THAT MIGHT BE EXEMPT FROM SITE PLAN VIEW ALL TOGETHER INCLUDING SPECIFICALLY OUTDOOR PATIOS AND PLAZAS, EVALUATING SYCES OF FLOOR AREA EXPANSION THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED WITH OUTSIDE PLAN REVIEW AT ALL AND EVALUATE EXPANSION OF ONE AND TWO FAMILY DWELLING EXEMPTION FOR UP TO SIX RESIDENTIAL DWELLING UNITS AS AN EXEMPTION. THERE ARE SERIES OF AMENDMENTS TO OUR SITE PLAN VIEW REQUIREMENTS THAT THE COMMUNICATION AND YOU WOULD BE UNDERTAKING. CONSIDER THE REMOVAL OF PLANNING COMMISSION APPROVAL REQUIREMENT OFDMINISTRATIVE APPROVAL LEVEL CHANGES WHEN A PAST SITE PLAN IS NO LONGER ON FILE, IT WOULD ELIMINATE THAT PROVISION OF THE ORDINANCE. CREATE A TRUE SITE PLAN MODIFICATION OR AMENDMENT PROCESS. REALLY AT THIS STAGE ORDINANCE ALLOWS APPROVAL OF SITE PLANS, YOU CAN APPROVE AT DIFFERENT LEVELS BUT PROVIDE A TRUE MECHANISM WHERE A PROJECT UNDER CONSTRUCTION OR RECENTLY BEEN APPROVED HAS A WAY TO MAKE MINOR CHANGES WITHOUT A FULL SITE PLAN SUBMISSION AND SUPPLANTING ORIGINAL SITE PLAN. CONSIDER A SKETCH PLAN OR TYPE OF INSTRUMENT TO ENABLE SMALL PROJECTS TO SUBMIT FOR REVIEW AND APPROVAL WITHOUT THE SAME LEVEL OF DETAIL AS LARGER PROJECTS. AND CONSIDER THE CREATION OF AN EXPEDITED SITE PLAN REVIEW PROCESS THAT CAME TO BUILDING DEPARTMENTS EXPEDITED PERMITTING PROCESS AS AN EXAMPLE, WHAT OPPORTUNITIES MIGHT THERE BE FOR US TO IDENTIFY PROJECTS FOR THAT PROCESS. EXPLORE AMENDMENTS OF DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS WE MEASURE AGAINST WHEN CONSIDERING THEM SPECIFICALLY CONSIDER A SCALABLE APPROACH OF LANDSCAPING SCREENING REQUIREMENTS FOR EXAMPLE APPLY STANDARDS TO AN AREA OF -- RATHER THAN WHOLE SITE WHEN A SITE IS BEING MODIFIED INCREMENTALLY. AND SPECIFICALLY CONSIDER AMENDMENT TO THE CONFLICTING LAND USE BUFFER REQUIREMENTS TO REMOVE REQUIREMENT FOR LIKE USES. THEN THE COMMUNICATION ALSO RECOMMENDS TWO OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CONSIDERATION THAT MIGHT AND DEFINITELY GO ABOVE AND BEYOND THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE RESOLUTION. ONE IS CONSIDERATION OF PLANNING COMMISSION APPROVAL OF ALL BY RIGHT SIDE PLANS. SITE PLAN REVIEW AND ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTION AND DOING THIS ENABLE PLANNING COMMISSION AND CITY COUNCIL PARTICULARLY FOCUS MORE ON LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS THAT GOVERN FUTURE PLANS CONSIDERED BY ANY LEVEL OF AUTHORITY IN THE FUTURE. AND THEN I PUT THAT THE ADVISORY WORK GROUP WAS UNEQUIVOCAL IN IMPACT OF CITY INFRASTRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS ON PRIVATE VELOPMENT AND HOW THOSE POLICY AND REIREMENT DECISIONS DRIVE CK OF ABILITY, CAN IMPAC DESIGN ASPECTS AND OTHER AMENITIES OF PROJECTS SUCH AS SUSTAINALITY OR FRANKLY TIMES JUST QUALITYF DIGN MATIALS AND ATORST THOSE RUIREMENTS CAMAKE SLLER TO MODEST PROJTS NOONGER VIAE. CHALLENGIN OR SOMIMES NOT THEN THE LT PIECE OF T THERE WE - I AM IERESTED ANI THI IT RESONATED WIT CONVERTIONS WITHLANNING MMISSION TO DE TO SEEK TABLE FOAT, SOMETHI THAT IS TYPE OF DEVELOPME THAT THEBE CLEAR DI LRNIATION OF ATIN A TYPE OINSTRUMENT IS QUIRED MAKES THE DECION ON TTAND WHO RATH TN TRYING TO NAVIGATE NUMEROUS PAGES OF TEXT BACKWARDS TO ARRIVE AT THAT SIMILAR. SO THIS LIKE I SAID I HAVE SHARED THIS FULL DRAFT COMMUNICATION WITH YOU EARLIER THIS EVENING. IT WILL BE APPENDED TO THIS PACKET AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC OVER THE COMING WEEKS. I CERTAINLY WELCOME ANY FEEDBACK OR CHANGES YOU HAVE OVER THAT TIME PERIOD AND AGAIN WILL BE ASKING FOR ANY ADDITIONAL MODIFICATIONS OR EDITS AND HOPEFULLY APPROVAL AT THE NEXT PLANNING COMMISSION MEETING. SO THAT JUST UNDER THE WIRE WE CAN COMMUNICATE THE STATUS UPDATE BY THE END OF THE CALENDAR YEAR TO CITY COUNCIL OF YOUR INTENTIONS TO UNDERTAKE WHICH CHANGES IN RESPONSE TO THAT RESOLUTION. FOR THE WORKING SESSION SCHEDULED NEXT WEEK, NO SPECIFIC PETITIONS SCHEDULED BUT INTEND TO SPEND SOME TIME WITH YOU TO FORMULATE HOW YOU WANT TO CONDUCT A WEBINAR OR OTHER COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT MECHANISM IN EARLY 2021 REGARDING ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT ORDINANCE REVISIONS. AT THIS TIME I AM ENVISIONING THAT WE PERHAPS SCHEDULE A WEBINAR FOR A JANUARY 5, FEBRUARY TIME FRAMEWORKING SESSION WHERE WE PRESENT SOME OF THE GOALS THAT WERE ORIGINALLY CONSIDERED MANY THE PREVIOUS SENSORY DWELLING UNIT ORDINANCES CRAFTED AND PROFFERED TO THE CITY COUNCIL. PROVIDES OPPORTUNITY FOR PUBLIC FEEDBACK AND THEN FROM THAT GIVE YOU AS THE PLANNING COMMISSION THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE WHATEVER FOLLOW-UP SETS OF DIRECTION YOU WOULD LIKE TO RECONSIDERATION OF THOSE CHANGES PREVIOUSLY PROFFERED. WITH THAT I AM DONE.
00:11:24.603: >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I WANT TO MAKE SURE I HEARD THIS RIGHT. IF TYPICALLY THERE'S NOT COMMUNICATIONS LIKE THE ONE WE HAVE BACK TO COUNCIL. SO IF THERE ARE THINGS COMMENTS WE HAVE IT'S -- AND EXPEDITE THINGS BEFORE VOTING ON THIS NEXT IN TWO WEEKS, IF THERE ARE CHANGES SEND THEM AHEAD OF TIME TO COLLATE AND WE CAN DISCUSS.
00:11:48.260: >> ABSOLUTELY. WE CAN ALSO CONSIDER MODIFICATIONS AT THAT MEETING BUT CERTAINLY IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING IN ADVANCE I CAN REFLECT THAT IN THE DRAFT AS WELL.
00:11:56.001: >> OKAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MR. LENART. ARE THERE ANY COMMISSIONER OFFICERS OR COMMITTEE LIAISONS THAT HAVE ANYTHING TO REPORT?

00:18:10.708: >> YES.
00:18:16.180: >> GO AHEAD.
00:18:17.081: >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TAKING THE TIME TO LOOK AT OUR PROJECT. I ALSO WANT TO SEND MY SPECIAL GRATITUDE TO CHRIS CHENG AND THE TEAM FOR WHAT HAS BEEN A YEAR AND A HALF, TWO YEARS SINCE WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS INITIALLY. THE OPPORTUNITY WE SEE AND NEED FOR TRYING TO BUILD THIS APARTMENT BUILDING IS -- THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN NUMBER OF STUDENTS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN I HAVE HEARD NUMBERS LIKE INCREASE IN 10,000 STUDENTS OVER 15 YEARS. CERTAINLY SINCE I GRADUATED WHICH WAS IN 1989 I THINK THE GROWTH HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY MORE THAN THAT. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE HOUSING HAS KEPT UP. WITH THE INCREASING STUDENT POPULATION. OUR TARGET MARKET THE TARGET MARKET AND ALSO INTENT OF THE STUDENT HOUSING FACILITY WE ARE SEEKING TO BUILD IS TO HOUSE STUDENTS BY WE BELIEVE VERY COMPETITIVE PRODUCT FOR THE UNIVERSITY COMMUNITY. THE PROPOSED SITE IS LOCATED AT 907 AND 913 SOUTH MAIN STREET, THOSE ARE JUST BETWEEN DAVID AND -- STREETS, THERE'S A LARGE DEVELOPMENT GOING ON MANY THE NEAR PROXIMITY OF THAT AS WELL. THE PROPERTY ITSELF HAS 100 FRONT FRONTAGE ALONG SOUTH MAIN WHICH IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MAIN ARTERIES ALONG WITH SOUTH STATE AND SO ON THAT IS FOR PEOPLE TRAVELING IN AND OUT OF ANN ARBOR. TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE, THE HOUSING UNITS AROUND THIS PROPERTY ARE PRIMARILY RENTALS, PRIMARILY STUDENTS RENTALS, THAT IS MY UNDERSTANDING. AS I NOTED I THINK WE ARE TRYING TO PROPROVIDE A COMPETITIVE PRODUCT AND ALSO ONE THAT IS SUSTAINABLE AND PROVIDES FEATURES THAT I THINK WILL BE ENJOYABLE FOR STUDENTS. AND IF NOT STUDENTS CERTAINLY FOR PARENTS. WE HAVE SEEKING TO PROVIDE SUPERIOR FIRE SUPPRESSION FIRE PROTECTION WHICH WE'LL GET INTO IN MORE DETAIL. EQUIPPING THE BUILDING WITH SOLAR PANELS TO PROVIDE ROUGHLY AFTER THE ANTICIPATED CONSUMPTION OF POWER IN THE BUILDING. THE OTHER THING WE ARE SEEKING TO DO IS TO PRODE ENHANCED ACTIVE OPEN SCE THROU HAVING MOST OF TH PKING AVAILABLE IN THE BUILDI BE UNDER T BUILDING WHICH I THINK WL HELP. AND TH OTHER AECT WE WK CIRCULARRIVEWAY IN FRONT OF THE BUILDING THAT  SEPATE AND APART FROM THEAIN ENTRANC O THEARAGE AND WHAT THAT ADTIONAL CIRCULAR DRIWAY DO IS PROVIDES EE OF USE AND ENCOAGES RIDE SRING OR CAR SHARING  WELLSNCREASING THEETWORKELIVERY WHETHER AMAZONELIVERY ORPS TRUCKS, GROCIES AND THE LIKE. WEPENT TIME MAKING SE WE WOULD VE A VERYASYCCESSO TH. THE OTHER THING I WOULD LIKE HILIGHT BEFORE IANDO THE TE AS PT OF THE PCE WE ARE AGREEING TO REPLACE THE WATER MAIN ALONG OR AT LEAST BETWEEN HOOVER AND DAVIS WHICH IS ABOUT 208 ALONG THE RUN WHICH I BELIEVE WILL BE SIGNIFICANT COST SAVINGS TO THE CITY AND OF COURSE I THINK THE COMPLETION OF THIS PROJECT WILL INCREASE THE TAX REVENUE O THE CITY. THE PROPERTY ITSELF WILL BE MANAGED PROFESSIONALLY, I CAN'T BE SPECIFIC COMMITMENT NOW BUT EXPECT THAT IT WILL BE OXFORD THAT WILL BE MANAGING THE PROPERTY AND I THINK THAT THEY HAVE A FAIRLY GOOD REPUTATION FOR MAINTAINING THE PROPERTIES IN THE AREAS IN GOOD STANDING. THE TEAM I AM WORKING WITH IS A SEASONED TEAM RATHER THAN TAKE THE TIME RIGHT NOW TO GO OVER THE SPECIFIC DETAILS I'M GOING TO KEVIN GRANT THE ARCHITECT ON THE PROJECT. AND PATRICK CLEARLY WITH BOSTON ENGINEERING BOTH HAVE DOZENS OF YEARS OF EXPERIENCE BUT WITH THAT I'M GOING TO TURN THIS TO KEVIN.
00:22:55.226: >> I WANT TO REITERATE THE COMMENT WORKING WITH STAFF, THEY HAVE BEEN GOOD TO WORK WITH, A LONG ROAD HERE BUT DEFINITELY GOOD PEOPLE WORKING IN YOUR DEPARTMENTS. SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS BUILDING ONE THING WE WANTED TO DO WAS PROVIDE A MODERN MINIMALIST TYPE PROJECT MINIMALIST SIMPLICITY USING CLEAN LINES HIGH QUALITY MATERIALS, OUR GOAL IS TO PROVIDE THE STUDENTS THE RENTERS THE OCCUPANTS A SPACE FOR PEACE AND FOCUS TO DO THEIR SCHOOL WORK AND THEIR ACTIVITIES AFTER SCHOOL AND OTHER THAN THAT WE HAVE ALSO PROVIDED IN THE LIVING SPACES, A LOT OF GLASS FOR NATURAL LIGHT VENTILATION. AND I THINK CHRIS, CORRECT ME IF I AM WRONG, I THINK THE COMMISSION HAS OUR SUBMITTAL. SO THEY CAN SEE ON SHEET A 400 SOME OF THE RENDERINGS AND SOME OF THE FLOOR PLANS AS WELL. EACH BEDROOM THERE'S 36 BED ROOMS AND EACH BEDROOM HAS THEIR OWN CONNECTED BATHROOM, WE HAVE DESIGNED THE LIVING LEVELS TO BE CENTRARAY LOCATED VERTICALLY SO ENTRIES ARE BETWEEN TWO SLEEPING SWEEPING LEVELS SO THERE IS NOT A SITUATION WHERE THERE'S STUDENTS GOING MULTIPLE STORIES TO GET TO KITCHEN AREA. EXCEPT UNITS 3 AND 6 WHERE THERE'S ONLY TWO LEVELS. WE PROVIDED EXTERIOR DECKS WHICH I FEEL THE SIZE, WE HAVE ONE AT 330 SQUARE FEET AND ONE AT APPROXIMATELY 5567 SQUARE FEET. THAT IS A ROOF LOW ROOF WE HAVE HAD WE CREATED A ROOF DECK. THESE SPACES ARE GREAT SPACES FOR CONNECTIVE TSUI FOR THE STUDENTS AND SOCIAL INTERACTION. FOR TIMES WHEN THEY ARE NOT STUDYING. IT'S ACTUALLY GREAT STUDY SPACES TOO. AS FAR AS SAFETY CONVENIENCE FEATURES, TALKED ABOUT PRIOR SAFETY P WE UPGRADED FROM A SPRINKLER SYSTEM NFPA 13. WHAT THIS DOES IS NOT ONLY PROVIDE LIFE SAFETY TO THE BUILDING BUT ALSO BUILDING PROTECTION. SO IT'S INTENDED TO PUT THE FIRE OUT. WE ALSO WORK WITH THE THE FIRE MARSHAL AND WE HAVE PUT TWO ROOF LADDERS, PER HIS DIRECTION AND ALL DWELLING UNITS ENTER EGRESS FROM DIRECTLY TO EXTERIOR. SO SO NO INTERIOR WAYS TO THE BUILDING. WE HAVE MAJORITY OF SPACES WE HAVE SEVEN OF THE NINE PARKING SPACE OF THE REQUIRED PARKING SPACES, UNDER THE BUILDING IT'S A SECURED PARKING AREA, ALL SEVEN SPACES WILL BE LEVEL 2 EV 1 OR EVI SO INSTALLED SPACES PER NEW ORDINANCE THE CITY IS LOOKING TO ENACT. AS FAR AS SECURE PARKING WE HAVE 8 FOR THE REQUIRED ONE THAT WE HAVE WE ARE LOOKING TO ADD TWO TO THREE MORE SO WE CAN HAVE 8 TO 11 BIKE PARKING RACS IN THE BUILDING. ALL THE TRASH AS WELL FOR CONVENIENCE TO THE STUDENT RENTERS IS INTERIOR TO THE BUILDING SO THERE'S NO EXTERIOR TRASH AND THE MANAGEMENT COMPANY WILL BE RESPONSIBLE PUTTING OUT THE TRASH AND ALSO TAKING IT IN.
00:27:09.446: >> ONE MORE MINUTE.
00:27:14.251: >> I GUESS I'LL GIVE -- WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS SO MAYBE I'LL HAND THIS OVER TO PATRICK CLEARLY. TO HANDLE SOME OF THE SITE ISSUES.
00:27:23.661: >> JUST MAYBE LIKE THREE OR FOUR POINTS HERE WITH TIME SRT. DO YOU WANT TO SKIP TO EXISTING CONDITIONS SLIDE THE GREEN HIGHLIGHTS ARE THE LARGER WALNUT TREES WE WERE TRYING TO WORK AROUND AND THE RED ARE EXISTING PARKING LOTS FOR THE HOMES THAT ARE LIKE HARD PACK GRAVEL THAT I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT. IF YOU SKIP TO THE LANDSCAPE PLAN, THE GREEN SHADED AREA, THAT MOST OF THAT PARKING LOT AREA WILL BE CONVERTED TO LAWN AND LANDSCAPE AND YOU CAN STILL SEE THOSE TREES THERE. ON THE LEFT-HAND SIDE THERE'S RED DASH LINES THAT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE OVERHEAD IN VARIOUS UTILITY LINES THAT INCLUDE THE STREET PLANTING. SKIP ORGANIZE THE SITE UTILITY PLAN, HIGHLIGHTS ON THE STORM WATER SYSTEM, IT'S A TWO TIERED SYSTEM BECAUSE OF THE SLOPING NATURE OF THE SITE WHERE WE ARE TAKING THE DRIVEWAY WATER GOING INTO ASIS ATTORNEY PURPOSING INTO THE CONVENTIONAL STORM WATER DETENTION SYSTEM THAT TAKES IN THE ROOF AND THE FRONT YARD AND THEN HAVE CONTROLLED DISCHARGE TO THE STORM WATER STORM SEWER SYSTEM AND JUST THE POINT THERE IS THAT RIGHT NOW ALL THE WATER GOES FROM LEFT TO RIGHT WEST TO EAST UNCONTROLLED PRIMARILY GOING TO BROWN STREET. WITH THIS IT WILL BE MUCH MORE CONTROLLED AND MUCH BETTER FOR THE SURROUNDING PROPERTIES.
00:29:06.864: >> TIME IS UP.
00:29:08.098: >> THAT'S WHAT I NEEDED TO HIGHLIGHT.
00:29:12.002: >> WE NEED MORE THAN TEN MINUTES.
00:29:17.675: >> WE HAVE QUESTIONS I'M SURE WE'LL BE CALLING ON YOU DURING THE DISCUSSION. MR. CHENG, DO YOU HAVE ANY SLIDES TO THIS CHAIR?
00:29:27.718: >> I DON'T HAVE ANY SLIDES BUT I WILL TOUCH ON ITEMS SINCE THEY WERE CUT SHORT ON TIME I THINK THAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL FOR BACKGROUND INFORMATION. THIS SITE ALSO HAS CONFLICTING LAND USE BUFFER AROUND THE PERIMETER SO THERE IS LANDSCAPING SCREENING FROM THE ADJACENT RESIDENTIAL. THIS SITE, BOTH SITES WILL NEED TO BE COMBINED TO MEET THE MINIMUM LOT SIZE SO THAT B ALL RIGHT OF APPROVAL PROCESS. THERE IS A LAND MARK TREE PROPOSED TO BE REMOVED ON THE WESTERN SIDE ANOTHER OF THE SITE TO ACCOMMODATE THE PROPOSED U SHAPED DRIVE COORDINATED BETWEEN SOLID WASTE URBAN FORESTER AND TRANSPORTATION BECAUSE IT WASN'T GOING TO WORK TO BACK OUDER OUT ON SOUTH MAIN STREET WITH THE TRAFFIC LEVELS SO THERE WAS A CASUALTY OF THE TREE, THERE IS MITIGATION FOR THE TREE. AS FAR AS STREET TREES, WE ALSO DISCUSSED GETTING A LANDSCAPE MODIFICATION FOR THIS SITE BECAUSE OF UTILITIES IN THE STREET. AND IT JUST WASN'T GOING TO WORK TO PUT IN THE STREET TREES THERE. IT DIDN'T QUALIFY FOR LANDSCAPE MODIFICATION SO AGAIN AS PART OF THE APPROVAL IT WILL NEED TO GO TO ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS TO REDUCE THE TWO STREET TREES SUPPORTED BY URBAN FORESTER DUE TO LOCATION OF UTILITIES AND SITE LINES. I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT I DID -- I THINK I'M ANTICIPATING QUESTIONS ABOUT LAY OUT OF PROSE POSED BUILDING. I DID TALK BRIEFLY WITH THE BUILDING DEPARTMENT REGARDING SITE LAY OUT IF IT WAS CARVED UP INTO DOUBLING UNITS FROM SIX TO 12. IT WOULD REQUIRE A FIREWALL TO BE INSTALLED TO SEPARATE THE UNITS. IT WOULD BE CAUGHT DURING BUILDING PLAN REVIEW OR HOUSING RENTAL INSPECTION IF THEY INDEED PUT UP FIREWALLS TO MEET CODE. WE ALSO PUT STIPULATIONS ON HOUSING REVIEWS, WHEN THEY GO TO RENT AND BUILDING PERMITS AND WE CAN ADD ITEMS TO THE SITE DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT IF THIS IS ONLY A SIX UNIT COMPLEX. FINALLY, I ALSO BECAUSE WHICH JUST FOUND OUT WE HAVE ONLY SIX MEMBERS FOR THE MEETING, THE PETITIONER IF THIS STARTS TO LOOK LIKE THERE MIGHT BE A SUPPORT FOR POSTPONEMENT OR NOT GOING TO GET ALL SIX VOTES IN AFFIRMATIVE, THAT HE WOULD PROPOSE FOR POSTPONEMENT FOR LATER DATE, SO I'M DISCLOSING THAT AT THIS TIME AND I'M HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE.
00:32:05.742: >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MR. CHENG. ALL RIGHT. THIS IS NOW THE PUBLIC HEARING FOR THIS ITEM. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PERSONS TO SPEAK FOR UP TO THREE MINUTES ABOUT THE PROPOSED MAIN AND DAVIS APARTMENTS DEVELOPMENT, PUBLIC COMMENT MAYBE MADE BY CALLING (877)853-5247 AND THEN ENTERING MEETING ID 97519942176. CITY STAFF WILL SELECT CALLERS THAT DIGITALLY RAISED THEIR HAND BY PRESSING STAR 9. YOU WILL BE CALLED BY THE LAST THREE DIGITS OF YOUR TELEPHONE NUMBER. YOU WILL GET AN AUTOMATED RESPONSE THAT YOU HAVE UNMUTED YOU MIGHT STILL NEED TO PRESS "*" 6 TO SPEAK.

THE AMOUNT O PEOPLE THAT ARE GOINTO BE LIVING INHIS PROBABLY 7PEOPLE LIVING INSIDE I JT HEARD CHRIS S SOMETNG ABOUT  MAY BE GOING TO 12 UNITS. THIS IS THE FIRST I HAVE HEARD ABOUT THAT. I'M CONCERNED ABOUT PARKING IT DOES NOT FIT INTO THE NEIGHBORHOOD WHATSOEVER. I SENT AN EMAIL IN RESPONSE TO EMAIL I GOT FROM MIA AND I BUILT MY HOUSE IN '04.NISHED IN M. -- '04. I BUILT THE HOUSE TO FIT INTO THE NEIGHBORHOOD. I DID THE VERY BEST THAT I COULD SO IT WOULD FIT THE NEIGHBORHOOD. IN BUILDING AS PROPOSED HAS NOT FIT INTO THE NEIGHBORHOOD AT ALL, PERIOD. I'M VERY CONCERNED AGAIN ABOUT THE PARKING SITUATION I JUST HEARD SOMEONE SAY THERE WERE SEVEN UNDERGROUND PARKING SPACES BUT I DIDN'T HEAR THE OTHER PARKING SPACES NOT UNDERGROUND. I WOULD THINK THAT YOU WOULD NEED TO HAVE AT LEAST ONE PARKING SPACE PER BEDROOM. THAT'S MY OPINION. AT LEAST THAT MANY. I DON'T THINK IT FITS IN, I THINK IT'S TOO MASSIVE. I AM NOT HAPPY WITH IT. PERIOD. THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY. I DON'T WANT TO KEEP RAMBLING ON HERE BUT I'M NOT HAPPY ABOUT IT.
00:35:41.024: >> THANK YOU.
00:35:41.591: >> DO I UNMUTE NOW?
00:35:43.927: >> I THINK THAT YOU I'LL BE MUTED AND KIND OF MOVED OUT OF THE SPEAKING AREA. WE DID RECEIVE YOUR COMMUNICATION IN OUR PACKET. COUPLE OTHER CALLERS ON LINE TO RAISE YOUR HAND IT'S STAR 9.
00:36:00.277: >> PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH NUMBER 750. YOU CAN UNMUTE YOURSELF WITH STAR 6 AND YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
00:36:16.326: >> THIS IS JULIE WEATHERBEE. I THINK MOST OF YOU KNOW MY. I LIVE AT 837 SOUTH MAIN. SO NEXT TO DENNY'S HOUSE WHO JUST SPOKE AND WE ALSO OWN 108 EAST DAVIS WHICH IS THE HOUSE THAT IS THIS NEW PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT WOULD BE IN THE BACKYARD THAT HOUSE, THAT HOUSE IS RENTED TO A PROFESSOR AND HIS WIFE WAS A RESEARCHER, MEDICAL RESEARCHER AND I THINK PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN DEN NEW'S HOUSE ARE ALSO NOT UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS SO THAT IS ONE THING TO BE AWARE IF THIS ENDS UP BEING ALL STUDENTS THERE'S PEOPLE AROUND TO KEEP AN EYE ON THEM FOR BETTER OR USE THROUGH YOUR PROJECT. BUT I WANT TO MAKE A COUPLE OF COMMENTS, I KNOW YOU GOT MY EMAIL BUT THE DEVELOPER HAS BEEN APPROACHABLE AND PLEASANT TO COMMUNICATE WITH, I APPRECIATE, VERY QUICK TO RESPOND TO QUESTIONS. I KNOW OUR FIRST ZONING REGULATION WILL LIMIT WHAT'S ON THE SITE AND THE WAY IT'S PRESENT SOD THAT'S -- IT IS WHAT IT IS. WE NEED TO LOOK AT THOSE MORE. SO THE STORM WATER THAT'S BEEN ANSWERED I SAY THE DEVELOPER SINCE I SINCE THIS LETTER HAS WHEN COMMUNE CASED AND ISSUES HAVE BEEN -- COMMUNICATED. AND ISSUES HAVE BEEN ANSWERED AS MUCH AS THEY CAN. STORM WATER HAS BEEN CONCERN, THEY ARE DOING WHAT IS POSSIBLE. THERE IS SHARED RETAINING WALL. THE LAND, THE PROPERTY MARKERS IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD ARE SORT OF SUGGESTIONS AND THEY DON'T NECESSARILY FOLLOW WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT. THEIR RETAINING WALL APPEARS IN OUR YARD BUT IT IS ACTUALLY OFFSET. I THINK AT THIS POINT WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO OR THEY ARE GOING TO DO IS KEEP RETAINING WALL, KEEP EVERYTHING AS IS, BUT IT BECOME ABOUT ISSUE IF WE NEED A WALL OR SOMETHING BECAUSE IT IS OFFSET A FEW FEET WHICH IS INTERESTING ADDITION TO THE HOW IT'S SET UP. SENSING TREES AND BUFFERS ARE A CONCERN, WE DO HAVE A VERY BIG --
00:38:52.315: >> 30 SECONDS. WE ARE GOING TO KEEP HA SO THAT'S GREAT. LIGHTING IS GOOD, SUSTAINABILITY, OPEN SPACE, PARKING AN DENSITY, IT IS WHAT OUR FORESEE IS THAT REGULATION, THE PROPERTY OPENERS IS GOING TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE PARKING. THERE ISN'T MORE SPACE AND THAT'S OKAY THAT IT DOESN'T GET COVERED WITH PARKING FOR ME. SO WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS BUT THE OWNER HAS BEEN GOOD TO WORK WITH AND I JUST WANTED TO SAY I DON'T OBJECT TO THIS, IS IT WHAT I DO PRESENCIALLY PROBABLY NOT BUT IT IS WITHIN THE REGULATIONS. THANK YOU.
00:39:27.684: >> THANK YOU. PHONE NUMBER ENDING 409. CALLER OF NUMBER ENDING 409. YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
00:39:49.806: >> PLANNING COMMISSION, MY NAME IS CHRIS RUSSELL. I'M CALLING IN IN SUPPORT OF THIS PROJECT. IT'S ACTUALLY (INAUDIBLE) WITH THE ASSEMBLAGE OF DUE PROPERTIES SO I HAVE BEEN OBSERVING, I DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER FINANCIAL INTEREST GOING FORWARD WITH IT BUT IT CERTAINLY IS SOMETHING I HAVE KEPT A CLOSE EYE ON IN THE TWO YEARS SINCE THEY HAVE BEEN UNDERTAKING THIS ENTIRE OR DEAL. BUT IT'S A VERY GOOD PROJECT, IT'S TWO TWO PROPERTIES THAT ARE KIND OF ROUGH SHAPE, THERE'S THE SITES ARE IN ROUGH SHAPE AND TAKEN THOSE ENTIRE SITES AND IT IS DOING QUITE A BIT OF WORK TO CLEAN THEM UP. JUST IN TERMS OF DRAINAGE AND OTHER THINGS THAT CLEAN UP THE ENTIRE AREA. IT'S THE PROJECT, IT WILL BE NICE IN THE FUTURE IN MY OPINION, THAT STRETCH OF MAIN STREET IS A LITTLE BIT DARK AT TIMES SO IT'S NICE TO SEE A PROJECT RIGHT THROUGH THERE AND MORE ACTIVITY. AT TIMES IT CAN BE A LITTLE DEVOID OF FOOT TRAFFIC AND OTHER THINGS, I THINK THIS WILL GO A LONG WAY WITH NEW LED LIGHTING AND JUST TO KIND OF SPRUCE THINGS UP A BIT. AND THEN ALSO I HEARD SOMEBODY MENTION ISSUES IN TERMS OF PARKING. I HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE WE RENT QUITE A FEW PROPERTIES, THERE JUST AREN'T AS MANY KIDS WITH CARS NOWADAYS. THERE AREN'T AS MANY STUDENTS WITH CARS NOWADAYS. PARKING SPOTS WILL TWO UNFILLED. SO IN TERMS OF WORRIES NOW ADAY, WHEN SOMEBODY THERE HAVE BEEN AN ISSUE IN THE PAST IT REALLY ISN'T ANY MORE. SO PARKING, THAT SEEMS TO BE BECOMING A THING OF THE PAST WITH THE SCOOTERS AND THE DELIVERY AND EVERYTHING ELSE. BUT I'M IN SUPPORT OF THE PROJECT. I LIKE IT, IT'S GOOD FOR THE AREA. AND THE DEVELOPMENT TEAM IS GREAT. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
00:41:52.028: >> THANK YOU. I THINK IF THERE IS ANYONE ELSE ON THE LINE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK YOU CAN PRESS "*" 9 TO RAISE YOUR HAND. AT LEAST TWO OTHER PEOPLE THAT ARE THERE HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN. MAE EVERYBODY, MR. LENART?
00:42:10.447: >> NO RAISED HANDS.
00:42:12.849: >> ALL RIGHT. THEN I WILL CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING. THERE'S --
00:42:20.623: >> REOPEN THE PUBLIC HEARING.
00:42:25.528: >> CALLER WITH PHONE NUMBER 663 YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
00:42:31.000: >> THANK YOU. CAN YOU HEAR ME?
00:42:33.069: >> YES.
00:42:35.472: >> EXCELLENT. MY NAME IS ROBERT AND I LIVE AT 837 SOUTH MAIN STREET. AND LIKE THE PREVIOUS CALLER, MY WIFE AND I OWN 108 EAST DAVIS BEHIND THE PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT. AND I WANT TO EXPRESS -- ITS SUPPORT BUT I DON'T THINK ANYONE REALLY LIKES THE SIX BEDROOM FORMAT BUT I THINK THAT IS WHAT THE CITY CODES PERMIT AND THE TWO PROPERTIES THERE ARE DIFFICULT AND SO I THINK AS MUCH AS I CAN I SUPPORT THIS. I AM EQUALLY UNCONCERNED WITH PARKING. IN THE FIRST PLACE THE NEIGHBORHOOD WE LIVE IN IS ALL PARKED UP. SO ADDING MORE PARKING JUST MEANS IT WOULD GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. NO MORE CAPACITY SO I DON'T KNOW THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE MUCH. I WOULD LIKE TO STRENUOUSLY POINT OUT THIS IS NOT REALLY THE STUDENT NEIGHBORHOOD. I THINK THAT THAT IS A MISCONCEPTION, IT IS RELATIVELY FAR FROM MAIN CAMPUS AND I THINK THE TRADE WINDS BUILDING AND THE EDINBURG BUILDING ON THE SOUTH AND EAST OF US ARE MIXTURE OF STUDENT AND WORK FORCE HOUSING. SO I DON'T REALLY LIKE THE IDEA OF A PURE STUDENT BUILDING. ON THE OTHER HAND, I REALLY LIKE THAT THEY ARE KEEPING THIS LARGE LAND MARK WALNUT TREE WE SHARE A BIT OF. IT IS A NEIGHBORHOOD RESOURCE THAT PROVIDES THE ENORMOUS SHADE, IT IS A WONDERFUL TREE AND IT REALLY SHOULD BE TREASURED. I ALSO APPRECIATE WORK TO KEEP STORM WATER TO A MINIMUM. EVERY PROPERTY ON EAST DAVIS ON THAT SIDE OF THE BLOCK IS DOWNGRADE I CAN'T WANT FROM THIS. SO MANAGING STORM WATER HELPS US ALL. ALL OUR STORM WATER FLOWS DOWN HILL AND WE ARE STRUGGLING IN VARIOUS WAYS TO MANAGE IT. THIS DOES HELP US THERE'S NOT MUCH THAT CAN REALLY BE DONE. OTHERWISE I THINK IT IS A REASONABLE DEVELOPMENT AND I HOPE THE PLANNING COMMISSION WORKS TO MAKE THIS AS GOOD AS IT CAN BE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
00:45:17.767: >> THANK YOU. IF ANY OF THE OTHER CALLERS ON THE LINE WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK ON YOUR HAHN., PRESS "*" 9 T RAISE
00:45:29.712: >> THAT'S EVERYBODY. THEY HAVE SPOKEN. GREAT. THEN I WILLLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING. FOREAL THI TIME. AND AD THE MOTION. WHICHS T ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMSSION HEREY COUNL APPROVE T 907 AND 913 UTH MAI STRT SE PLA AND DELOPMENT AGREEMT SUBJECT T MBINED BOTH LOTS BORE ISSUANCE OF Y PERMITS AND BY THE ZONING BRD OF APPEALWAY VED BY COMMISSIOR MSHTEYN, CONDED BY COMMISSNER SAUVE. IN AT THION. ANYBODY WA THE KICK U OFF?
00:46:12.255: >> I HAVE  COUPLE OF QUEIONS. WANTO NOT FIR IANT TO EXPRESS GRATITUDE FOR PUBLIC WHO CALLED IN AND SENT US NOTES, I APPRECIATE THE THOUGHTFULNESS AND DETAILS OF THE QUESTIONS THEY RAISED AND ALSO APPRECIATE THE UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE ZONING PERMITS HERE. I APPRECIATE THAT'S REFLECTED IN YOUR COMMENTS. WE DON'T LIKE WHAT IT PERMITS BUT IT PERMITS IT SO THERE WE GO. WE HAVE TO WORK WITH IT. SO I WANTED TO JUST VERIFY, THIS WAS A QUESTION THAT I HAD HAD EARLIER. YOU MENTIONED THAT THE SOLAR YOU ARE INSTALLING ON THE ROOF WHICH I THINK IS TERRIFIC, IS GOING TO OFFSET ABOUT 50% OF WHAT THE -- IS WHAT IS USED AT THE PROPERTY, I WANT TO VERIFY I HEARD THAT RIGHT. THAT'S A GOOD NUMBER.
00:46:59.635: >> I MEAN LOVELY WE ARE LOOKING AT -- ROUGHLY WE ARE LOOKING AT 20, 25KW, BASED ON PRELIMINARY ELECTRICAL LOADS WE ARE LOOKING AT A 4 HUNCH OAT THE SOLAR CAN HANDLE AROUND 200-AMPS PLUS OR MINUS. SO YEAH WE ARE LOOKING TO HOPEFULLY OFFSET HALF THE LOAD REQUIRED AM PANEL WISE.
00:47:26.696: >> THAT'S GREAT. AMPAGE WISE.
00:47:31.300: >> I DIDN'T HEAR YOU SAY THIS IN THE PRESENTATION BUT I MIGHT HAVE ZONED OUT BUT I UNDERSTOOD YOU WERE PROVIDING PARKING FOR TWO ZIP CARS.
00:47:40.376: >> SO LET ME SPEAK TO THAT. I'M EXPLORING THAT AS AN OPTION. SO BASICALLY THE WAY THE PARKING WE HAVE SEVEN SPOTS UNDER THE BUILDING AND TWO SPOTS IMMEDIATELY OUTSIDE THE BUILDING. MY GOAL IS TO TRY AND HAVE THOSE TWO SPOTS BE AVAILABLE FOR CAR SHARING SERVICES. I HAVEN'T FINALIZED OR ENTERED INTO A CONTRACT. I CAN'T BE 100% THIS IS A DONE DEAL BUT THAT IS -- THIS GOES BACK TO ADDRESSING SOME OF THE COMMENTS ABOUT PARKING. I THINK THE WAY PEOPLE USE CARS IS CHANGING DRAMATICALLY AND MY -- NEXT FIVE TO TEN YEARS I WILL BE SURPRISING IF MANY OF US ARE EVEN DRIVING BUT THE GOAL IS TO FOR US TO PROVIDE CAR SHARING SERVICES. AS I MENTIONED EARLIER, THE U SHAPE OR CIRCULAR DRIVEWAY IN FRONT OF THE BUILDING WILL PROMOTE USE OF THE EASE OF EMPTY EXIT OF RIDE SHARING AS OPPOSED TO CAR SHARING.
00:48:41.471: >> THANK YOU. I JUST -- I AGREE WITH YOU ABOUT THE USE OF CARS IS CHANGING AND IT'S AN ENORMOUS EXPENSE. SO PEOPLE WHO LIVE WITHOUT CARS PREFER TO DO THAT. SO IF YOU ARE ABLE TO MAKE A PROVISION FOR CAR SHARING, IT WOULD ALSO REALLY FACILITATE THAT LOWER IMPACT LIFESTYLE. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE QUESTION ABOUT THE RETAINING WALL AND SNOW REMOVAL AND STACKING OF SNOW NEAR THE RETAINING WALL, THAT ALL OF THAT HAS BEEN ANSWERED BETWEEN -- WE RECEIVED A LETTER ABOUT THAT AND MS. WEATHERBEE RAISED THAT IN HER CALL. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT HAD BEEN WORKED OUT BECAUSE THE RETAINING WALL FROM THE PICTURE WE GOT IN THE COMMUNICATIONS FILE, IT'S LOOKING A LITTLE LESS LIKE A WALL AND MORE LIKE A PILE OF STONES IN SOME PLACES. SO I'M WONDERING HOW THAT IS GOING.
00:49:44.734: >> IF I MAY I DID SEND MS. WEATHERBEE AN EMAIL WITH RESPONSE. QUICK SUMMARY, DRIVEWAY WILL BE HEATED SO OUR EXPECTATION IS, IS THAT WE WOULDN'T HAVE MASSIVE SNOW PILES. I THINK WE ARE REQUIRED TO SHOW A SNOW ZONE FOR WHERE THE SNOW WOULD BE STOCK PILED OR WHATEVER BUT OUR INTENT IS TO OR WE WILL BE HAVING THE DESIGNS RIGHT NOW IS A HEATED DRIVEWAY. WITH REGARDS TO -- I WILL URN IT TO PATRICK BUT WITH REGARD TO TRAINING WALLS CAN I TURN THIS TO YOU PATRICK FOR A RESPONSE?
00:50:19.001: >> SURE. JUST A COUPLE OF ADDITIONAL ITEMS. THE EXISTING RETAINING WALLS ARE NOT BEST OF SHAPE. THE -- I THERE -- WE MIGHT HAVE ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION LATER ON. THERE IS ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE EXISTING RETAINING WALL WHICH IS STILL ON THE PROJECT SITE PROPERTY AS WAS SAID BEFORE, SOMETIMES THE LINES ARE SUGGESTIONS. THERE IS EXISTK LANDSCAPING VEGETATION, THINGS OF THAT SORT THE NEIGHBORS LIKE. SO WE WANT TO TRY TO PRESERVE ALL THAT. THEN THE OTHER COMMENT IS MANY TERMS OF THE PROXIMITY OF THE WALL TO REST OF THE CONSTRUCTION THERE IS ABOUT 8 TO 9 FEET OF SEPARATION FROM EDGE OF PARKING SPACE TO BACK OF THE WALL. SO THERE IS SOME AREA THERE THAT WE COULD -- THAT'S KEEPS IT FROM GETTING DISTURBED TOO MUCH.
00:51:35.344: >> I WANTED TO ADD IF I MAY, HAPPY TO REACH OUT TO MS. WEATHERBEE TO SEE IF SHE HAD SOME THOUGHTS OR IDEAS WHAT WE CAN DO MANY THE GRAND SCHEME OF THE COST OF THIS DEVELOPMENT. I THINK UPGRADING OR MODIFYING THE RETAINING WALL WILL NOT BE -- AND CERTAINLY HAPPY TO FIGURE OUT A SOLUTION THAT I THINK WILL BE SATISFACTORY FOR ALL OF US.
00:52:03.706: >> ONE OTHER THINGT GETS BACK TO PRESERVING THE WALNUT TREE. THERE IS A NORTH SOUTH WALL AND EAST WEST WALL. THE EAST WEST WALL IS GROWING -- TREE IS GROWING INTO THE WALL AND THAT REALLY NEEDS TO BE PRESERVED TO PRESERVE EVERYTHING ELSE AROUND IT. SO THAT'S ALSO GOING TO BE PART OF THE DISCUSSION.
00:52:36.706: >> IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE COMMISSIONER DISCH?
00:52:40.242: >> I GUESS I FORGOT TO SAY ONE OR NICE THING, THANK YOU FOR ALL BIKE PARKING.
00:52:46.048: >> COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN.
00:52:52.321: >> THANK YOU. SO MY QUESTION PRIMARILY STEMS FROM PARKING. I WANT TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING HOW CARS ARE GOING TO MOVE IN AND AROUND THE FIRST IN THE INDOOR PARKING AND THEN FURTHER LITTLE BIT OUT THE OUTDOOR PARKING. ESPECIALLY BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKES SOME OF THE SPOTS ESPECIALLY SPOTS ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE BUILDING APPEAR THAT -- I'M TRYING TO FIGURE HOW PEOPLE WILL BACK IN AND OUT, HOW ADEQUATE SPACE TO DO SO, ALL THE SPOTS ARE TIGHT IN THERE AND I'M HAVING SOME TROUBLE UNDERSTANDING HOW THE TURNING RADIUS LIKE HOW THAT ALL WORKS. SO CAN SOMEONE SPEAK TO THAT? IN REGARDS TO PARKING WITHIN THE BUILDING FIRST THEN I HAVE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS REGARDING THE SPOTS OUTSIDE.
00:53:43.406: >> CAN I TURN THIS TO YOU OR PATRICK?
00:53:49.245: >> I CAN TRY TOOTHINESS. WE LAID OUT THE PARKING, ANY INTERIOR PARKING IS ALLOWED IT INSIDE THE BUILDING SO BASED ON STANDARDS OF THE CITY ORDINANCES AS FAR AS PARKING IS CONSIDERED. WE DO HAVE TWO ALLOCATED COMPACT SPACES WHICH ARE INSIDE THE BUILDING. THEY ARE 8 BY 16. REST OF THE SPACES ARE 9 BY 18 WITH 22-FOOT LANE. SO IN EFFECT IT'S NOT ANY DIFFERENT THAN PARKING LOT OUTSIDE THE DISTANCE AT A BUILDING. IT'S AS TIGHT AS YOUR NORMAL PARKING SPACE AND DRIVE ISLET, ALLOWED WITHIN ANY COMMERCIAL PROJECT.
00:54:38.427: >> SO THE WAY THE SPOT IN THE SOUTH -- IN THE SOUTHWEST SIDE OF THE BUILDING. NUDGED IN THE CORNER.
00:54:51.774: >> COMPACT SPACES?
00:54:52.842: >> YEAH. THE TWO COMPACT BUT ONE IS THAT IS AT THE VERY END OF THE BUILDING ON THE SOUTH SIDE. HOW IS THAT PERSON GOING TO BE PULLING OUT?
00:55:06.522: >> SO FARCE -- THAT'S WHY WE PUT THE COMPACT IN THAT AREA THERE BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE BACK UP CAPACITY TURNING BACK BECAUSE SMALLER CAR. THAT LAST NINE FOOT SPACE NEAR THE WATER METER AREA IS TIGHT BUT WORKS. IT DOES WORK. IT'S WITHIN REASON. THAT IS WHY WE PUT CONTACT SPACES WHERE WE DID BECAUSE IT IS TIGHTER. A NORMAL PARKING SPOT WOULDN'T IN THOSE TWO SPOTS.
00:55:42.091: >> MR. CHENG ANY COMMENTS FROM STAFF PERSPECTIVE?
00:55:46.262: >> I WAS LOOKING AT THE LAY OUT TO REFRESH MY MEMORY. IT IS CORRECT, YOU HAVE A MINIMUM 22-FOOT LANE MEETING THE MINIMUM LANE ALLOWED UP TO 35% SMALL CAR PARKING SO IT APPEARS TIGHT BUT ALSO APPEARS THAT IT'S MEETING THE MINIMUM CODE. JUST TO GO BACK AND TOUCH ON PARKING WAS A CONCERN. PER OUR ORDINANCE YOU ONLY NEED ONE AND A HALF SPACES PER UNIT. SO THERE MAYBE 36 BEDROOMS PROPOSED BUT ONLY NINE PARKING SPACES REQUIRED.
00:56:20.229: >> THANK YOU, MR. CHENG. MY NEXT QUESTION HAS TO DO WITH REGARDS TO TWO PARKING SPOTS OUTSIDE. SOMEBODY PULLS IN, HOW ARE THEY GETTING OUT OF THOSE TWO SPOTS? SOMEONE WALK ME THROUGH THAT.
00:56:38.747: >> NOW HOW THEY ARE GETTING OUR OF THE SPOT BUT HOW THEY GET OUT MAIN STREET.
00:56:44.320: >> SO THOSE -- ALL RESIDENTS, CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG, BUT IT IS AN OVERHEAD GARAGE DOOR SO THE PARKING SECURED AND HEATED. WHAT WE'LL DO IS ANY OF THE TENANTS WILL HAVE GARAGE DOOR OPENERS SO IF THEY NEED TO THEY WILL BACK OUT OF THE SPACE, OPEN THE GARAGE DOOR BACK IN A BIT AND PULL OUT. SO THAT'S WHAT WE'LL END UP DOING.
00:57:20.723: >> THANK YOU THAT ANSWERS THAT QUESTION. MOVEMENT IN THE FRONT OF THE BUILDING SO YOU BET A BETTER SENSE OF THE U SHAPED DRIVEWAY THERE. SO WILL THERE BE PARKING ALLOWED IN THE U SHAPED DRIVEWAY? PULY FOR DELIVERIES
00:57:40.309: >> THAT WILLE A NO PARKING ZONE. ONE THG I REMEMBER FROM WHEN I WAS (INAUDIBLE) THE TOW TRUCK COMPANIEIN ANN ARBOR ARE INCREDIB GOOD ATAKING SURE -- THAT WILLE FOR LOADING UNLOING ZONE A THERE WILL BE SIS POSTED IICATING. OF THA SPOT, HEANG SOUBOUND JUST THE WAY FROLOOKING A THE PLANFROM THE SE PLAN, IT'S ARE TIGHT THERE AUND SOUTHS MAIN. HAS THE BEEN -- HAS A TRAFFIC ENGINEEROOKED AT TT AND MADE RE THAT THERE IS ADEATE SPACTO TURN UTHBOUND ONO IN? FROM THAT? U SHAPED DRIVE?
00:58:37.933: >> DO YOU REMEMBER THE NUMBER --
00:58:38.801: >> WE HAD QUITE EXTENSIVE DISCUSSION ABOUT THE HOW WE CAN MAINLY RELATED TO DELIVERY VANS BEING LIVING IN ON SHEET C 9C WHICH IS THE VERY LAST PAGE IN THE PACKET. SHOW AS COUPLE OF SCENARIOS CIRCULATION PLANS ABOUT HOW THE LIKE A LOADING VAN LIKE FEDERAL EXPRESS OR AMAZON WOULD BE GETTING IN AND OUT AND PRESUMABLY IF THEY CAN NAVIGATE IT THAT A SMALLER PASSENGER CAR WOULD HAVE MUCH LESS ISSUE.
00:59:20.576: >> MR. CHENG, WAS OUR TRAFFIC ENGINEER INVOLVED IN REVIEW OF THIS?
00:59:25.948: >> WE DID HAVE EXTENSIVE REVIEWS WITH THE TRAFFIC ENGINEER WITH THE ENGINEER WITH SOLID WASTE AND WITH URBAN FORESTER TO COORDINATE ALL THE TRAFFIC MOVEMENTS THE SITE VISIBILITY ON SITE, PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC, TRASH PICK UP SO IT TOOK QUITE A FEW MEETINGS AS PETITIONER WILL PROBABLY TELL YOU OF COORDINATION TO GET TO THE POINT FOR THIS DESIGN WITH TURNING RADIUSES AND FOR IT TO BE APPROVED BY ALL FOUR DEPARTMENTS.
00:59:54.676: >> THERE IS ALSO TWO -- I THINK ALL THE C 9 SHEETS, SAY THAT THREE TIMES FAST. THEY ALL HAVE TO DO WITH THE VISION CLEARANCE AND THE CIRCULATION.
01:00:11.426: >> C 9A C 9B.
01:00:16.331: >> A, B, C.
01:00:18.567: >> THEY ARE FUN MEETINGS. WE HAD A GREAT TIME DOING THOSE. FUN.
01:00:25.240: >> GREAT. OKAY. SO THAT IS MY QUESTIONS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ANSWERING THOSE. OVERALL I THINK IT'S A ATTRACTIVE BUILDING. THERE'S BEEN SOME RENOVATION AND NOW 618 AND 615 BEING BUILT, THIS WILL FIT IN FAIRLY NICELY INTO THAT AREA. SO KUDOS TO YOU FOR DOING SOMETHING OUT OF THE BOX IN THAT AREA. THANK YOU FOR NOT MAKING IT BROWN BRICK. APPRECIATE THAT TO HAVE SOME VARIETY IN THAT CORRIDOR. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT. I'M SUPPORT ACTIVE OF THIS DEVELOPMENT, NOT WORRIED ABOUT PARKING, I WANTED A BETTER UNDERSTANDING HOW CARS WOULD BE MOVING IN AND AROUND THAT SITE. SO THANK YOU SO MUCH.
01:01:15.490: >> THANK YOU.
01:01:16.491: >> COMMISSIONER ABONNS.
01:01:19.494: >> HI. I JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS. SO I GUESS ONE IS THE WALNUT TREE I'M GATHERING IS 'ALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE NEIGHBORS OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD. I JUST WONDERED WHAT ARE THE PROTECTIONS THAT GET PUT INTO PLACE TO MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T GET DAMAGED DURING CONSTRUCTION? BECAUSE WE DEFINITELY HAVE TIMES WHEN THE PLAN IS TO SAVE A BELOVED TREE BUT THERE'S SOMETHING WHICH INEVITABLY HAPPENS AND THEN YEAH THE PETITIONER HAS TO PAY INTO THE TREE FUND BUT THAT DOESN'T HELP PEOPLE ON THIS BLOCK WHO LOVE THIS TREE SO I WANTED TO HEAR A LITTLE BIT ABOUT PLANS FOR PROTECTING IT DURING CONSTRUCTION.
01:02:02.804: >> DO YOU WANT TO ADDRESS THAT? ONE THING. I LOVE THAT TREE TOO. NUMBER OF HOURS WE SPENT WORKING AROUND REMODIFYING OUR DESIGNS TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WOULD BE AS PROTECTED AS POSSIBLE IS VERY SIGNIFICANT. IT WASN'T SOMETHING THAT JUST WE WERE IGNORING H. WE DOCUMENTED SOME PROTECTION MEASURES AND HAPPY TO DO MORE AS NEEDED. WE DOCUMENTED THIS OVER THE PAST.
01:02:30.966: >> WE HAD AGAIN EXTENSIVE STAFF CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS VERY ISSUE. SHEET 6C 6B THERE IS A SPECIAL SOLID COMPACTION MITIGATION AND TREATMENT PROCESS THAT WILL ELABORATE ON THAT EVEN MORE BUT SIMPLY PUT THERE WILL BE A COUPLE OF TECHNIQUES THAT ARE CAN BE SUCCESSFUL AND KEEP IN MIND THERE WAS A GRAVEL PARKING LOT THERE NOW SO THE ROOTS ARE HAVE BEEN I GUESS COMPACTED. WE WOULD BE REMOVING THAT. THERE WOULD BE A COMBINATION OVERCLOCKS FENCING TO KEEP IT AWAY FROM THE TRUNK A BIT BUT FROM REALISTIC STAND POINT YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET TO THE CROWN. SO ANOTHER TECHNIQUE IS TO USE THICK LAYERS OF BARK MULCH TO MINIMIZE ANY FURTHER COMPACTION THAT BE ON THERE SO VEHICLES REASONABLY CAN DRIVE OVER THAT DURING CONSTRUCTION AND AS LONG AS YOU DON'T LEAVE THE PARK MULCH ON THERE MORE THAN COUPLE OF MONTHS YOU ARE NOT SUFFOCATING THE ROOTS OR DOING DETRIMENTAL DAMAGE, SO THERE'S A NUMBER OF TECHNIQUES SIMILAR TO TO KEEP PROTECTED AND THEN IN THE END BY CONVERTING THAT TO MORE LAWN AN LANDSCAPE AREA SHOULD BE HELP IN THE LONG RUN AND IF THERE WAS ANY DAMAGE TO THE -- WITH REMOVAL OF THE GRAVEL TO HELP RECOVER IT ALL THAT MUCH BETTER.
01:04:08.330: >> OKAY. THANK YOU. MY NEXT QUESTION IS ABOUT THE YARD SPACE AND THE BACK, THE OPEN SPACE WHICH I THINK IS REALLY GREAT AMENITY AND FEATURE OF THE SITE PLAN. WONDER IF THERE IS ANYHOW DO YOU IMAGINE THAT SPACE BEING USED AND ALSO MAYBE IF YOU THOUGHT ABOUT THE MAINTENANCE OF THAT YARD AS A RECREATIONAL SPACE FOR 30 SOME ODD UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS AND THE WAYS MIGHT GET USED, MAYBE WAYS THAT FALLS UNDER PROPERTY MAGMENT AGREEMENT WITH OXFORD.
01:04:43.331: >> THE MAINTENANCE WILL CERTAINLY FALL UNDER THE PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT. I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS WE DID IS TWO VERY DAN IN THE BACK AND A ROOF TOP AND THEN THE OPEN SPACE. I THINK ALL THOSE SPACES I THINK ARE GOING TO WORK WELL TOGETHER FOR STUDENTS TO HANG OUT RELAX WATCH A FOOTBALL GAME AND SO ON. IN OUR INTENT IS TO MAKE -- SOME OF THE OTHER STUDENT HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS POOLS AND OTHER CRAZY THINGS. NOT GOING TO BE LIKE THAT, IT WILL BE MORE PICNIC TABLES OR SOMETHING WE GATHER AROUND, WE HAVEN'T FORMALIZED THE EXACT LOCATION BUT I THINK THE WAY WE DESIGN THE BUILDING IS L SHAPE, AND WHAT I'M IMAGINING IS THE OTHER SQUARE RETAINING WALLS WILL CREATE A NICE RECTANGULAR AREA AND IF YOU ARE ON THE ROOF SPACE LOOKINGOWN I THINK YOU WILL CREATE A NICE MOVEMENT AND ACTIVE OPEN SPACE IN THAT SECTION SO THAT OUR PLAN IS TO DO SOMETHING NICE THAT KIDS CAN ENJOY. I DON'T HAVE THE SPECIFIC LIST OF FURNITURE OR THINGS PUT THERE AS YET BUT IT WILL BE MEANT TO BE FOR KIDS TO ENJOY A NICE --.
01:06:06.481: >> THANK YOU. MY LAST QUESTION IS -- I APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS MADE AND DESIGN AND IN THE PROJECT TOWARDS SUSTAINABILITY SOLAR PANELS CHARGING STATIONS. WONDER AS PROJECT TEAM YOU TALK ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF ELECTRIFYCATION WHERE YOU WOULD NOT BRING NATURAL GAS LINE WHICH IS FOSSIL FUEL TO THE BUILDING BUT ACTUALLY HAVE APPLIANCES IN HVAC THAT FULL ELECTRIC.
01:06:38.280: >> SO WE WANT TO AND WE NEED TO HAVE BACK UP POWER GENERATION. I THINK FOR THAT WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO HAVE NATURAL GAS SUPPLY. WITH REGARDS TO GAS SUPPLY INTO UNITS THEMSELVES WE CAN PROBABLY AVOID THAT. WE HAVEN'T MADE A FINAL DECISION ON WHETHER FOR THE COOK TOPS WOULD BE GAS OR ELECTRIC. BUT I THINK WE WILL NEED GAS FOR SURE BECAUSE OF THE BACK UP POWER GENERATION. THE QUESTION IS AND I'M CERTAINLY OPEN TO IT IF YOU GUYS MANDATED THAT WE NOT HAVE GAS INTO THE KITCHEN, BUT I DON'T THINK IT WILL BE A BIG DEAL. WE CAN CERTAINLY DO THAT BUT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE NATURAL GAS INTO THE BUILDING BUT NEED BE PRIMARILY FOR THE BACK UP GENERATION GENERATOR.
01:07:27.762: >> IT'S NOT SOMETHING I'M GOING TO MANDATE ANYWAY BUT IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WILL BE A DEAL BREAKER BUT STRONGLY ENCOURAGE YOU --
01:07:38.907: >> GO AHEAD.
01:07:40.542: >> SORRY ONE THING WE TALKED ABOUT THIS RECENTLY, AS PART OF THE SOLAR THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO POTENTIALLY -- WE TAKE AWAY FROM THE SOLAR FOR THE ELECTRIC OF THE BILLING BUT MAYBE USE SOLAR TO FOR HOT WATER HEAT FOR HEATING UP THE WATER. IT'S A TOTALLY DIFFERENT SYSTEM. SO IT'S A POSSIBILITY. WE ARE OPEN TO A LOT THINGS. I GET IT. POTENTIALLY NOT HAVING GAS IN THE BUILDING IS GREAT BECAUSE WE CAN OBVIOUSLY DO A LOT OF THINGS WITH THAT AND OPPORTUNITIES TO HAVE GAS FOR GENERATOR FOR BACK UP POWER AND WHETHER THAT'S EVEN NECESSARY OR NOT, IT'S SOMETHING THAT WILL -- AGAIN AS BUSINESS MODEL FOR THE RENTAL A LOT OF THINGS I'M DOING, DO SOME PROJECT MS. DETROIT WITH WE ARE DOING WORK FORCE HOUSING AND A LOT OF THINGS WE ARE DOING ARE ELECTRIC, TRYING TO GET AWAY BUT IT'S HARD TOO BECAUSE ELECTRIC IS EXPENSIVE TOO. WE HAVE TO LOOK AT AS SOON AS THINGS CHANGE WILL WHERE GAS AND ELECTRIC ARE ON EQUAL BASIS BUT THE ONLY WAY WE DO IT IS WITH ALTERNATIVE SOURCES. WE ARE OPEN FOR THAT.
01:09:01.823: >> THE ALTERNATIVE SOURCES ONLY HELP IF WE ARE USING ELECTRICITY MADE BY THOSE ALTERNATIVE SOURCES INSTEAD OF THE NATURAL GAS P.
01:09:14.169: >> I WOULD SAY IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE DO THINGS LIKE THAT THAT ARE SUSTAINAB AND RENEWABLE. THAT'S DOWN T WE ARE LOOKING AT DOING THINGS ABOVE THE TRADITIONAL ENERGYODE. STANDARDS WHICH IS A CODE THAT SO WE ARE LOOKING TOOAN FILE EXTENSIVE INSULATION. ANTHINGS OF TT ANITURE.
01:09:44.332: >> THANKOU.
01:09:47.635: >> THAT'S ALL. ALL OFY QUESTIO. THAN.
01:09:55.143: >> SOOMMISSIONER HAMMERSMIDT I SEE YOU. I DON'T KN IF ANYBODYLSE BUT LA CONCTION AND SO DID RIS CHENG. SOOUNDS LIKE I MIGHT BE A CITYHING. SINCE SO OF USAY HAVE QUESTIS FOR THEM,R AT T VERY LST THEY TE NOTES TO REPO THE THAT OUT WHEN THIS GOESN WHAT I'M GOING TO RECESS NOW HE' RURNINGYN MINUT TE WHICH MEANSE'S FIGURIN HOW TO G BACK ON WITH IT. SO LET'S TE OUR WATER BREAK BATHOM BREAK N AND COMEANG IN TENINUTES TIME.
01:10:38.987: >> CE BACK IN TEN MINUTES TIME PFECT. LL DO.
01:10:42.490: >> THANKOU.
01:10:43.458: >>EP.
01:21:30.071: >> THANK YOU GUYS FOR THE NICE COMPLIMENTS YOU HAD FOR STAFF. OKAY. WHERE ARE MY QUESTIONS? SO I HAD A COUPLE OF PARKI RETED. ONE WAS TRIGGERED BY SOMETHING COMMISSIONERILSHTEYN SAID. WAS CURIOUS MAYBE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE MANEMENT YOU HAVE THOUGHTS HOWARKING IS I'M ASKING WHAT HAPPENS IF SOMEBO PULSE INTOHE GARAGE AN SITSES ARE TEND AND HOW THEY BACK UP. I GUESS WAS JUST WONDING IF SPOTS.D THOUGS ABOUT AIGNING YES AND NO, GOOD IDE H TO PROCD BUT WHAHAPPENS IS THEY GET PERMIT REQRES AND USUALLY  LITTLE BIT OF TAG THAT YOUANGN RR-VI MIRR. THEYRE GOING T GET CODE. I THK ONE SNARIO IS ONE SCENARIOS EACH UNITETS A SPOT A THENHEREOULD B AN TRA UNIT. AS IENTIONEDARLIER, THEWO SPOTS TSIDE I WANT TO TRYND PA -- THAT IS GOING TOAVE CAR SHARING. SO THAT'S KIND OF WT I WAS THINNG. BUT IT'SOT 100% CERTAIN. THINK THEREILL BE A LITTLE SELF-SELTION IN THE SENSE THAT THEY WILL ADDRESS PARKING ISSU. THERE'SLENTY OF OTH UNITS IN THAT AREA TT OFFERARKINGS PA OF THE RENTA PACKAGE IF TTUDENT REALLY NEEDS PARK ORGANIZE HAS A CAR, THEY'RE JUST GOING TO NOT RENT IN OUR UNIT AND IT IS WHAT IT IS. SO THAT'S -- IT'S A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE FOR ME NOT TO HAVE PARKING BUT I THINK IN THE LONG RUN I DO BELIEVE WHAT I SAID EARLIER WHICH IS I THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE FIVE TEN YEARS DOWN THE ROAD I DON'T SEE THIS NEED FOR MASSIVE PARKING LOTS.
01:23:27.354: >> I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH AMOUNT OF PARKING. WHEN I WAS A STUDENT LONG TIME AGO. I HAD A CAR WHEN I LIVED IN A DORM I GOT CREATIVE HOW TO PARK IT. PEOPLE WILL FIND A WAY.
01:23:39.066: >> EXACTLY
01:23:39.567: >> WHAT I WAS MORE CONCERNED IS LOOKING AT THE CONFIGURATION OF THE GARAGE, IF THERE IS A SAY LIKE TEN OF THEM HAVE CARS AND THEY ALL COMPETE TO TRY TO PARK IN THERE AND IT'S FULL LIKE -- IS THERE ENOUGH ROOM TO I BACK OUT?
01:23:52.680: >> RIGHT. THERE WON'T BE -- I MEAN UNLESS SOMEONE PARKS ILLEGALLY, THERE WOULDN'T BE TEN, THERE WOULD BE AT MOST SEVEN. IF SOMEONE PARKS ILLEGALLY AND CAN'T GET OUT THEY'LL CALL THE MANAGEMENT COMPANY AND THE MANAGEMENT COMPANY WILL GET IT TOWED IS WHAT WILL ESSENTIALLY HAPPEN. AND TYPICALLY THE WAY IT WORKS THEY DON'T ASSIGN ONE SPECIFIC SPOT, THEY GENERALLY ISSUE FOR EXAMPLE IN THIS CASE SEVEN PARKING TAGS. AND THEY ARE FREE TO PARK WHEREVER THEY WANT.
01:24:24.612: >> ONLY SEVEN TAGS ARE ASSIGNED BUILDING THERE'S NO PROBLEM.
01:24:27.781: >> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. IF SOMEONE BREAKS THE RULES THEY WILL GET TOWED.
01:24:32.653: >> YEP. SO BACK TO TWO SURFACE PARKING SPACES BECAUSE COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN ASKED HOW YOU GET OUT OF THOSE SPACES. I THINK THE RESPONSE WAS IF THEY ARE RESIDENTS THEY HAVE A GARAGE REMOTE AND THEY CAN BACK IN A THAT WAY. BUT IF THEY ARE GOING TO BE CAR SHARING, SPACES FOR CAR SHARING, I THINK THEN THEY WOULD BE BACKING OUT ALL THE WAY INTO MAIN STREET. DOES THAT SOUND RIGHT?
01:25:03.917: >> I MEAN, IT DOESN'T SOUND RIGHT BECAUSE I THINK WE STILL HAVE THE GARAGE DOOR OPENER IN THE CAR BUT IT DOES BRING UP POSSIBILITY THAT SOMEONE NEEDS THE GARAGE DOOR OPENER FOR WHATEVERSONS. AND IF WE GO DOWN THAT ROAD WE WILL PROBABLY HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WAY TO HAVE THAT GARAGE DOOR OPENER SOMEHOW NOT BE ABLE TO BE TAKEN OUT OF THE CAR. I HAVEN'T GONE DOWN THAT FAR IN MY THINKING FRANKLY BUT I THINK WE COULD -- I THINK WE COULD PROVIDE SOME KIND OF A FIXED -- WHAT I'M HOPING FOR, THERE IS A COUPLE OF COMPANIES THAT I HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT BASICALLY A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN ZIP CAR WHICH IS A ZIP CAR ALLOWS YOU THE BASICALLY PARK ANY CAR IN THOSE ASSIGNED SPOTS BUT THERE'S NEW COMPANIES COMING OUT THAT ARE MORE OFFERING THIS TO LANDLORDS Z AN AMENITY BUT OFFER -- TWO FIXED CAR -- THERE IS A CERTAIN NUMBER OF SPECIFIC CARS THAT ARE ONLY IN THAT PARKING LOT. BUT THAT IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN THE ZIP CAR MODEL. THIS IS MORE -- GO AHEAD.
01:26:15.956: >> I WAS GOING TO ASK IS IT ONLY THEN FOR TENANT USE?
01:26:19.526: >> EXACTLY. IT'S ONLY -- IT'S REALLY AN INTERESTING MODEL AND I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO OR HOW THAT CAN BE SERVICED BUT THE IDEA WOULD BE THERE WOULD BE TWO CARS AND IT WOULD BE EXCLUSIVE USE OF THE TENANT.
01:26:34.641: >> THEN THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO HAVE REMOTES. YEAH. THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING, YOU'LL HAVE TO LET US KNOW. IT'S AN INTERESTING MODEL.
01:26:46.186: >> THERE'S SOME REVENUE SHARE I THINK THE LANDLORDS THE NUMBER I GOT FROM ONE COMPANY IS 10, 15% OF REVENUES THEY SHARE WITH THE LANDLORDS NOT THAT THAT'S WHAT I'M SEEKING BUT THAT'S THE BUSINESS MODEL THEY ARE OFFERING.
01:27:00.401: >> AND I THINK THAT KIND OF SPECIFIC MODEL TOO I WOULD THINK WOULD ALLEVIATE THIS CONCERN THAT LIKE 70 PEOPLE ALREADY BRINGING CARS TO THE SPOT WHEN YOU HAVE ACCESS TO A COUPLE DEDICATED FOR YOUR BUILDING CARS AND YOU CAN RESERVE IT IF YOU NEED TO GO TO THE GROCERY STORE, SOMETHING LIKE THAT. I THINK THAT TAKES AWAY A LOT OF THAT CONCERN. YOU KNOW WHEN I HAD MY CAR ON CAMPUS, A LOT OF IT WAS BECAUSE I NEEDED TO MAKE GROCERY TRIPS.
01:27:36.870: >> EVEN THAT MODEL IS CHANGING. I THINK A LOT OF GROCE
01:27:44.011: >> THE WAY I BUY GROCERIES IN THE GROCERY STORE.  THANKS, COVID.  I APPRECIATE THE DECKS IN THE LONG SPACE.  I THINK THAT SPACE IS IMPORTANT.  SO I REALLY LIKE THAT.  YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT THE COMMENT ABOUT THIS DOESN'T REALLY FIT IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OR THIS IS NOT REALLY A STUDENT NEIGHBORHOOD.  SORT OF INTERESTING COMMENTS.  I THINK ABOUT THIS AS THE DISCUSSION HAS BEEN GOING ON AND YOU HAD MENTIONED SOMETHING AT THE BEGINNING ABOUT THE POPULATION OF THE UNIVERSITY'S GROWING SO MUCH AND THE HOUSING CAN'T KEEP UP WITH IT AND WHERE THIS LOCATION IS MAYBE THIS IS NOT A STUDENT NEIGHBORHOOD NOW BUT WE'RE PRETTY CLOSE TO SOUTH CAMPUS.  LIKE I JUST -- NOT -- I THINK IT -- YOU KNOW NOT THAT IT'S GOING TO CHANGE INTO A FULLY STUDENT NEIGHBORHOOD BUT I SEE THAT STUDENTS WOULD BE ATTRACTED TO THIS PARTICULAR AREA.
01:28:38.332: >> I HAVEN'T -- I'M SORRY, I AM JUST GOING TO ADD -- I HAVEN'T SEEN WHAT THE PLANS WHAT THE SITE WOULD BE.  BUT MY EXPECTATION IS THAT THE UNIVERSITY IS GOING TO -- I THINK ONCE -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT ALL IS GOING TO GO THERE BUT MY EXPECTATION IS THIS WILL FEEL A LITTLE BIT CLOSER TO CAMPUS WHEN THAT DEVELOPMENT HAPPENS AS WELL.  SO --
01:29:01.922: >> YEAH, TO ME IT ALREADY FEELS SORT OF CLOSE TO CAMPUS BUT I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT IF THAT COMES IN THAT WOULD BE EVEN MORE SO. YOU KNOW, AND I SEE IT BEING PROFESSIONALLY MANAGED BY A MANAGEMENT COMPANY.  NEIGHBORS WILL BE ABLE TO CONTACT SOMEBODY IF THERE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT NOISE.  I ALSO REALLY LIKE THE DESIGN.  I'M NOT AN ARCHITECT BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS NICE.  I DON'T THINK IT LOOKS TOO OUT OF SCALE FOR THE NEIGHBORHOOD.  SO I GUESS MY LAST QUESTION OF THE MOSTLY COMMENTS, SORRY.  WAS, YOU KNOW, LIKE, IN DOING, YOU KNOW, HAVE YOU DONE A MARKET ANALYSIS AND DO YOU SEE THAT THERE IS A MARKET FOR SIX SPECTRUM UNITS BECAUSE THAT'S A LOT OF UNITS.
01:29:44.064: >> RIGHT.
01:29:44.431: >> PER MEASURES IN UNIT.
01:29:46.099: >> SO I OWN A FEW OTHER PROPERTIES, SHICH ARE SIX BEDROOM UNITS.  AND TYPICALLY THE WAY THIS HAPPENS IS IF YOU'RE VERY PROACTIVE IN MARKETING AND ON SCHEDULE, WE TEND TO GET LARGE GROUPS AND, YOU KNOW, THEY SIGN ONE LEASE. IF THEY FAIL THAT AND COMES APRIL/MAY WE'LL HAVE TO RENT BY ROOM.  MY GOAL AND MY PREFERENCE WOULD BE TO RENT TO A LARGER GROUP.  AND, YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHERE I THINK OXFORD COMES IN. THEY DO A REALLY GOOD JOB OF SCHEDULING, LEASING.  NOW MY EXPECTATION, I THINK -- SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE PUTTING IN, AGAIN, IF I THINK OF THE BEDROOM AS A PRODUCT.  SOME OF THE THINGS WE'RE DOING IS TO HAVE AN ATTACHED BATHROOM, FOR EXAMPLE, I THINK THOSE KINDS OF THINGS REALLY HELP.  HELP WITH THE MARKETING AND I THINK IT'S ONE OF THE -- FROM -- THERE'S A STUDENT HOUSING MAGAZINE THAT DOES THESE SURVEYS.  THAT'S THE NUMBER ONE REQUESTED AMENITY. MY EXPECTATION IS THAT, YOU KNOW, AS LONG AS WE'RE NOT PRICING THE RENT OUT AT IN A VERY HIGH NUMBER, WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO BUILD THE -- FILL THIS PROPERTY.  AT LEAST, I'M BETTING A LOT OF MONEY ON THIS AND I'M NOT THAT DEVELOPER, I PROMISE YOU.
01:31:13.687: >> I WAS IN COLLEGE A HUNDRED YEARS AGO AND I HAD FIVE ROOMMATES SO WE WOULD HAVE LOVED A SIX BEDROOM SIX BATHROOM HOUSE.
01:31:21.395: >> AND IT'S A FUN EXPERIENCE FOR KIDS TOO TO BE ABLE TO SHARE AND THEN, YOU KNOW, A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING IS JUST TO HAVE AT LEAST TWO KIND OF SPACES FOR PEOPLE TO HANG OUT SO YOU COULD -- AND IT CAN BE A LARGER SPACE WHEN, YOU KNOW, IF YOU WANTED TO STOP THAT FLOW, MY HOPE IS IS THAT -- ESPECIALLY WHEN WE DO THE BACKYARD AND THE ROOF SPACE AND ALL OF THAT, I THINK THERE'LL BE SOME ATTRACTIVE FEATURES.  THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO HAVE SWIMMING POOLS AND MOVIE THEATERS AND CRAZY THINGS LIKE THAT BUT ATTRACTIVE FEATURES TO HANG OUT, RELAX AND HAVE FUN AND HOPEFULLY STUDY AT SOME POINT.
01:31:59.466: >> YEAH, AT SOME POINT.  WELL, THANK YOU, IT'S NICE TO HEAR THE COMMENTS FROM THE CALLERS THAT YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN A GREAT TEAM TO WORK WITH.  APPRECIATE ALL THAT YOU'VE DONE TO WORK WITH THE NEIGHBORS.  THAT IS IT FOR ME FOR NOW.  THANK YOU.
01:32:15.849: >> COMMISSIONER.
01:32:19.219: >> A FOLLOW UP ON AN A COUPLE THINGS.  I APPRECIATE A LOT ABOUT THE BLACK WALNUT MAINTAINING THE RETAINING WALL BUT THERE IS QUESTIONS ABOUT THE LINE.  I WANT TO DISCUSS ABOUT THE DRIP LINE OF THAT CASHER OF THE WALNUT TREE.  WHAT'S PLANNED FOR THAT.
01:32:43.477: >> PATRICK, CAN I TURN THIS OVER TO YOU?
01:32:46.646: >> WELL, I MEAN, I GUESS THE SHORT ANSWER IS THAT, EXCAVATION WILL HAVE TO BE DONE VERY CAREFULLY.  I GUESS I -- NOT TO BE -- NOT TO SOUND TOO FLIP ABOUT IT BUT THAT WE ALREADY, YOU KNOW, TO A PRETTY GREAT EXTENT, THERE'S A LOT OF HOUSE FOUNDATION THERE'S A LOT OF OLDER FOUNDATION TURNED DRIPLINE IN THAT VICINITY.  THERE'S THE GRAVEL PARKING LOT.  IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE DIGGING INTO VIRGIN SOIL. SO I THINK, AGAIN, WE'D HAVE TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT IT, DO SOME OF THE PROTECTION ITEMS THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER.  BUT THERE IS ALREADY A LOT OF DISTURBANCE IN THAT AREA AND PRESUMABLY THE WAY THE ROOTS ARE, ARE KIND OF GROWING AWAY FROM THAT AREA RIGHT NOW.  OBVIOUSLY, WE'D NEED TO CONFIRM THAT BUT I THINK IT'S A LITTLE BIT LESS OF AONCERN IN THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION THAN IT WOD BE AGAIN IF IT WAS ALL NE PRISTINE LAWN O SOMETHING LIKE THAT IF THAT HELP
01:33:58.185: >> A LITTLE BIT, AND THEN I DO SEE C 6, NOPE,T'S A DIFRENT ONE. IT IS CALD OUT I ONE OF THE PLS, 3, TO HE ONHAT NOH/SOUTH RETAING WALL TO HAVE T RETNING WL BEHIND CONFIRM ISHAT SECOND RETAINING WALL HPENING Z? R IS IT NOTATE THAT IT COULD HAPPEN RELATIVE T DISCUSSIONSITH THE NEHBORS. THE NOTE TT Y SEEAS LEFTVER FROM A PREVIOUS ITERATN SO I APOGIZE FOR AT.  WE DID HAVE - THERE WER A CPLE DIFFERE SCENAOS WHERWE WERE PLACING TT LL.  THEAY IT IS NOW, WE CAN KE THA WAL AND TN AS I MEIONED, THE IS VEGETATION ON THE EASTIDE OF THATALL THATHE NEIGHR WOULD LIK TO KEEP A S TT'S I BELIE THE CURRT PLAN CRECT ME IF I'M ONG BUT THINK THE MOR WE KNOW, UNDERSTANDING TT THE YO WALL'S - DOESN'TOOK THE BEST, I AGREE BUT THE MORE WE CAN KEEP THE AREA INTACT THE BETTER FOR EXISTING TREES IN THAT AREA.
01:35:25.739: >> THAT JUST HELPS BECAUSE IT SOUNDED LIKE YOU COULD GO EITHER WAY SO I WANTED THE CLARIFICATION AND WHAT THE INITIAL PLAN IS AND IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE GOT DISCUSSIONS IF SOMETHING --
01:35:38.652: >> WE HAVE LOOKED AT THAT QUITE A BIT AND I APOLOGIZE FOR THE ERRANT NOTE THERE.
01:35:45.392: >> OTHER QUESTIONS, EV PARKING I SAW THAT WILL BE INCORPORATED BEFORE IT GOES TO CITY COUNCIL IS THAT ONLY FOR THE UNDERGROUND SPACES OR THE TWO EXTERIOR SPACES AS WELL?  WHERE IS THE PLAN FOR THE ED CHARGING?
01:36:03.510: >> EVAN, YOU'RE ON MUTE.
01:36:10.784: >> SORRY ABOUT THAT.  WE WILL HAVE THE SEVEN SPACES UNDER THE BUILDING WILL BE INSTALLED WITH LEVEL TWO CHARGERS.  THE TWO OUTSIDE AND, AGAIN, I WILL REFER TO THEM.  WE WILL HAVE THAT ED READY UNLESS YOU WANT TO DO THOSE AS WELL.  IT'S UP TO YOU BUT WE DEFINITELY WILL HAVE THE SEVEN IDEAS THE ED INSTALLED.
01:36:40.413: >> OKAY.
01:36:41.114: >> I THINK THAT'S RIGHT.  OUR IMMEDIATE BUILD IS TO MAKE SURE THE SEVEN ARE READY WITH REGARDS TO THE TWO OUTSIDE ONE.  IT'S GOING TO -- IT'S GOING TO DEPEND ON HOW THEY GET USED, WHETHER I CAN REALLY FIND A CAR SHARING COMPANY THAT -- IF THEY'RE ONLY USING ELECTRIC CARS WE'LL CERTAINLY MAKE THAT HP  -- HAPPEN BUT OUR INTENT IS TO MAKE IT ED READY.
01:37:07.240: >> I GUESS IT'S JUST THAT IT CAN BE AND DOESN'T REQUIRE MORE CONSTRUCTION FOR THOSE SPOTS. GOOD TO HEAR.
01:37:12.879: >> SORRY, LISA, IF I CAN BACKTRACK TO YOUR -- WE DO HAVE -- WE HAVE AN ARBORIST ON WITH OUR GROUP THAT WE CAN GO BACK TO AS FAR AS THAT WALNUT WHEN WE DO CONSTRUCTION TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY EFFORT IS, YOU KNOW, BASED ON THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS WITH CONSTRUCTION, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, AGAIN, CONSTRUCTION IS WHAT IT IS BUT WE WILL DO EVERY EFFORT. WE'RE GOING TO DO A MINIMUM AMOUNT OF WORK BACK THERE.  ONCE WE GET THE TRENCH IN THERE'S NO VEHICLES TO GO BACK THERE APART FROM CONSTRUCTION.  EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE COMING OFF OF MAIN. WE DEFINITELY WILL WORK WITH THE ARBORIST AND WORK WITH THEM ON THEIR PATH OF RECOMMENDATIONS INTO MINIMIZE ANY DAMAGE TO THAT TREE.
01:38:06.199: >> THERE'S TECHNIQUES.
01:38:07.300: >> YEAH.
01:38:08.902: >> TERMS OF -- YOU CAN DO SOME PREEMPTIVE PRUNING OF THE CANOPY AND  WILL COMPENSATE SATE FOR SELECT PRUNING OF THE ROOT ZONE AND YOU CAN CUTM CLEANLY AND DO OTHER TECHNIQUES SO THAT THE TREE CAN, YOU KNOW, CAN KIND OF ABSORB THAT.  THE MAIN THING IS IS THAT YOU WANT TO DO THAT A LITTLE BIT AHEAD OF TIME. PREPARE THE TREE, PREPARE THE SITE BEFORE YOU ACTUALLY START DIGGING.  SO THAT'S ALL GOING TO BE PART OF THAT PLAN.
01:38:41.801: >> OKAY.  YEAH, THAT'S -- I MEAN THAT'S WHERE -- IT CAN BE A REALLY ACTIVE SITE AND THE MORE STRATEGICALLY YOU WORK AWAY FROM THERE IT SEEMS LIKE SUCH AN IMPORTANT ASSET AND WE'VE SEEN OTHER PROPERTIES WHERE WE CAN'T HAVE SO MUCH OF A SAY IN KIND OF REVIEWING SOME OF THE TREE'S NATURAL FEATURES TOO. ESPECIALLY GOING FROM SINGLE FAMILY TO THIS.  WE'VE GOT A LOT MORE KIND OF CONTROL AND A STAKE IN THE NATURAL FEATURES WE CAN HAVE CONTROL OF.  MY NEXT QUESTION IS ACCESS FOR DELIVERY. SO IF WE HAVE DELIVERY TRUCKS AT THE TOP.  IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S A SMALL PAVED AREA NEXT TO THE DRIVEWAY BUT IT MIGHT GO FROM, LIKE, EIGHT FOOT WIDE TO THREE OR FOUR FEET WIDE AT THE BOTTOM WHERE THERE'S A DOOR INTO THE GARAGE SO I'M JUST TRYING TO GET AN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW DELIVERY DRIVERS ARE BRINGING IT TO THE PARCEL LOCKER AND THE MAILBOXES IN THE DRIVEWAY AND IF THEY'RE WALKING DOWN THAT RAMP, SIGHT LINES WITH CARS COMING OUT, VERSUS A PARCEL LOCKER.  YOU KNOW.  AT THE FRONT OF THE BUILDING OR SOMEWHERE ELSE THAT THEY'RE NOT WALKING IN THE DRIVEWAY.  SO IS THERE A WAY TO MAKE --
01:39:58.378: >> WE NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT PUTTING IT UP AT THE TOP BUT WE POSSIBLY COULD.  BUT CONVERSELY, I DON'T THINK ANYBODY GOING UP AND DOWN THAT RAMP IS GOING AT AN EXCESSIVE SPEED.  YOU KNOW, IT'S SOMETHING WE CAN LOOK UP, PUT IT AT THE TOP.  POSSIBLY PUTTING AT THE TRUCK, AMAZON OR FEDEX OR DHL OR UPS COMES AND DELIVERS WE CAN HAVE.  WE WERE LOOKING AT DOING A LOCKS BOX WHICH IS A BRAND.  I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH IT BUT IT'S A PROPRIETARY MAIL PACKAGING SYSTEM.
01:40:37.784: >> YEP.
01:40:38.484: >> THAT TRACKS THE PACKAGES BEING DELIVERED.  SO -- IN LIEU OF ALSO HAVING A USPS BOX AS WELL FOR GENERAL MAIL.  WE CAN DO THAT AT LOOKING IT BE UP THERE.  AGAIN STUDENTS WOULD HAVE TO GO UP THERE.  HALF THE ENTRIES ARE OFF THE FRONT ANYWAY AS WELL.  SO THREE OF THE THREE ENTRIES ARE OFF THE FRONT SO I GUESS WE COULD LOOK INTO THAT.
01:41:08.181: >> IT SEEMS LIKE A RISKY.  YOU KNOW, YOU'VE GOT NO LOADING RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE PARCEL LOCKERS BECAUSE BECAUSE THEY'RE THERE IT SEEMS SO EASY FOR THE DELIVERY TRUCK TO JUST COME DOWN THAT RAMP, PARK RIGHT IN FRONT OF IT.  TUCK THEM INTO THE PARCEL LOCKERS AND DRIVE OFF. CONNECTING THOSE TWO THINGS TOGETHER IN THE SAME LOCATION AND, YOU KNOW, OR EVEN JUST WIDENING THAT SIDEWALK RAMP DOWN WITH A CURB SO THAT THEY'RE CARRYING PACKAGES ON A TROLLEY LIKE THEY HAVE THE WIDTH TO DO THAT IF YOU'VE GOT ROOM TO NARROW THAT DRIVEWAY AND INCREASE THAT SIDEWALK RAMP I THINK ONE OF THOSE TWO THINGS IS REALLY IMPORTANT SINCE W THAT SOMETHING -- PACKAGES ARE JUST THE NEW THING TO RESOLVE. SO THAT WAS A THING I WOULD LIKE TO SEE ADDRESSED.  AND IF YOU FLAG THESE IF YOU SEE THEM MOVING FORWARD.  I WILL NOT HAVE THAT AS AN ISSUE WITH THIS PROJECT HERE BUT IF WE COULD SEE THOSE UPDATES BEFORE IT COMES TO CITY COUNCIL A THAT WOULD BE GREAT.
01:42:23.756: >> JUST TAKING A NOTE ON THAT BECAUSE IT WOULD NEVER OCCUR TO ME TO GO TO THAT LEVEL OF DETAIL SO THANK YOU.
01:42:29.896: >> YEAH.  AND ELECTRIC APPLIANCES, I JUST ENCOURAGE THAT TOO.  I THINK IT'S AN EASY THING AND PERSONALLY I THINK WE LOOKED AT R 4C.  R 4C IS SUCH A UNIQUE USE TYPE WITH THEEPZ SIX BEDROOMS AND A LOT OF THESE PRODUCTS WE SEE ARE HARD TO CONVERT AND AS WE ASSESS THIS USE TYPE IN THE SIX BEDROOMS THIS PROJECT IS FEASIBLE TO CONVERT. I KNOW IT'S BEEN RAISED AS AN ISSUE TO CREATE MORE UNITS BUT AS PARKING IS BY UNIT INSTEAD OF BEDROOM AND SO, LIKE, THE BEDS DON'T CHANGE, LIKE -- YOU CAN SEE IT DOESN'T CHANGE.  I THINK THIS IS ACTUALLY A BENEFIT OF THE PROJECT THAT SOME OF THESE UNITS COULD BE SPLIT INTO A TWO BEDROOM AND A FOUR BEDROOM INSTEAD OF A FULL SIX BEDROOM WITH MULTIKITCHEN AND, YOU KNOW, HOW THEY USE ON THE ENTRY FLOOR, ET CETERA. SO FOR ME I WOULD ADVISE TO DO THE RATING TO SEPARATE THEM IN THE FUTURE.  IF ORDINANCES CHANGE AND ACTUALLY ALLOW FOR MORE UNITS.  REALLY THAT NEW CONFIGURATION WITH HOW IT'S SET UP ENABLES EVEN MORE DIVERSITY WITHIN THIS DEVELOPMENT.  YOU CAN HAVE A SIX BEDROOM UNIT FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS.  YOU CAN HAVE A ONE BEDROOM UNIT FOR INDIVIDUAL WORKFORCE.  YOU CAN HAVE TWO BEDROOM UNITS AND FOUR BEDROOM UNITS FOR FAMILIES.  SO I ACTUALLY THINK IT'S A BENEFIT TO SEE KIND OF THE INGENUITY AND FLEXIBILITY OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS SIZE.  BEING ABLE TO SWITCH BETWEEN DIFFERENT UNIT SIZES.  SO I THINK THIS IS A GOOD CASE FOR HOW R 4C IS THINK FORWARD AND BE AN ADAPTIVE USE PROJECT INSTEAD OF US BEING STUCK WITH THESE SIX BEDROOM UNITS AFTER THEY'RE BUILT.  JUST A COMMENT THAT THAT'S THE SIDE OF PREFERENCE THAT I'M ON WITH SEEING HOW THIS PROJECT MOVES FORWARD AND I THINK THE COMMERCIAL FIRE SUPPRESSION AND THINGS LIKE THAT YOU HAVE THE PROJECTS SET UP TO BE ABLE TO SET UP IN THE FUTURE IF ORDNANCE ALLOWS.  THAT'S IT FOR ME. THANK YOU.
01:44:56.509: >> I WAS GOING TO END ON THAT COMMENT.  USUALLY WE DON'T GET INTERIORS OR DON'T LOOK CLOSELY AT INTERIORS.  THERE ARE SIX UNIT BUT ELEVEN KITCHENS.
01:45:08.855: >> RIGHT.
01:45:09.121: >> YOU GUYS, THAT WAS SUPER SAVVY.  I MEAN, I GOT TO SAY, THIS DESIGN WAS SUPER CREATIVE IN THINKING ABOUT HOW YOU CAN HAVE FUNCTION BUT WHAT -- ARE THERE TWO KITCHENS IN UNITS IN THIS TOWN?  BUT WHY TWO KITCHENS?
01:45:27.039: >> AGAIN, I THINK ABOUT THE BEDROOM AS A PRODUCT.  AT LEAST IN MY MIND AND SPECIFICALLY I THINK ABOUT IT AS A PRODUCT THAT'S BEING MARKETED TO GENERALLY THE MOTHERS AND PARENTS OF KIDS, RIGHT?  SO FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I'M TRYING TO CREATE -- TO BE VERY COMPETITIVE.  WHEN I THINK ABOUT WHAT STUDENT HOUSING WILL LOOK LIKE IN THE FUTURE, THIS IS NOT LIKE A SINGLE FAMILY HOME WHERE EVERYBODY'S GOING TO BE SHARING ONE MEAL.  RIGHT?  WITH ONE SHARING.  WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS YOU VE SIX KIDS THERE MAY BE KOSHER VERSUS NON KOSHER.  OR NDU VERSUS N HINDUND TS IS A WAY TO OFFE A DIVERSITY. IN AND JUS THE PRACTICALYF K IT.  IF THERE'S GOING TBE MULTIPLE PEOPLE COOKG AND B TWO KITENS,OU CAN HAVEIKE , OR BASICALLTWO PEOPLE COOKI SIMUANEOUSLY ANDHEN GOING BACK TO TOMPETITIVENE OF IT.  I SEE A L OPEOPLE FERING, YOU KN, TWO APARTMENT THA HAS SIXEDROOMS. MINE ISUST AN EXTENSN OF THAT IDEA.  Y DON'T HAV TWO REFRIGERORS OR TWO BINETS. YOU HAVEWO TCHENS.  I THI THIS WILL BE A BIG COMPETITI LIKE THE YARD OR OTHER RTS DELOPMENTS.  OR AT AID WON'T HAVE TO GO UP TWO FGHTS OF STAIRS.  THE ARE A THINGS TH I THINK -- I FEEANYWAYS IS A COMPETIVE ADVANTAGE F AT BEDROOM AS  PRUCT.
01:47:29.495: >> I JUST THI TRE ARE OTHER THINGS ABOUT THIS DESIGN WHICH LISA'S -- COMMISSIONER SAUVE IS VERY INTO ADAPTIVE REVIEWS. MANY OF THESE UNITS HAVE TWO FRONT DOORS.  THE STAIRWAYS ARE MEANT -- IT SEEMS THAT HALF OF THE BEDROOMS ARE UPSTAIRS HALF ARE DOWNSTAIRS.  I'M JUST SAYING I THINK IT STRETCHES.  GO AHEAD.
01:47:53.152: >> I WANT TO ADDRESS THAT BECAUSE I DO THINK, SAUVE, HIT IT ON THE HEAD IF I'M SAYING IT RIGHT.  ORDINANCES CHANGE.  IF IT CHANGES I WANT TO BE ABLE TO SEPARATE IT BUT IF IT DOESN'T CHANGE THERE'S LOTS OF RESTRICTIONS ON MY ABILITY TO SEPARATE THE PROPERTIES.  THE INSPECTIONS, AND I CAN'T HAVE MULTIPLE LEASES.  I'M FULLY COMMITTED TO HAVE BEEN 36 BEDROOMS.  FROM A NOVICE PERSPECTIVE IT MIGHT INCREASE THE RENT BY 5-15%.  SOMEWHERE IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD AS OPPOSED TO TOING -- TO BEING ABLE TO RENT. I THINK I WILL GET THE RENT. THE BIG PRIMARY REASON TO DESIGN IT IS IF THE ORDNANCE CHANGES I WANT TO HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO SPLIT THEM AND SPLIT THEM EASILY.  BUT I STILL -- I WILL STILL HAVE AN ISSUE WITH SAY, THE METERS AND WITH THE UTILITIES.  THERE'S LOTS OF THINGS, YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT JUST A MATTER OF PUTTING A ONE HOUR RATING TO CREATE TWO SEPARATE UNITS.  THERE'S LOTS OF RESTRICTIONS.
01:49:33.519: >> YEAH.
01:49:34.787: >> -- UNLESS SOMETHING ELSE CHANGES.
01:49:37.323: >> SO AS LONG AS YOU'RE AWARE OF THAT --
01:49:38.958: >> IF YOU TAKE IT FROM -- I'M SORRY.
01:49:40.659: >> GO FOR IT.
01:49:41.761: >> GO AHEAD, SARA.
01:49:43.295: >> NO, GO AHEAD.
01:49:45.131: >> AND TAKE IT FROM ME AS THE DESIGNER OF THE BUILDING.  IT'S GOING TO BE HARD.  IF WE WANT TO TURN IT INTO TWELVE UNITS, IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT TO DO. EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE DOUBLE KITCHENS THERE'S STILL A LOT OF FACTORS CODE-WISE THAT WOULD MAKE THAT VERY HARD.  TAKE IT FROM ME.  IT'S SIX UNITS.
01:50:07.353: >> AS LONG AS YOU KNOW THAT.  I MEAN, I THINK --
01:50:12.258: >> YEAH.
01:50:12.491: >> -- AGAIN, IT CAUGHT MY EYE JUST BECAUSE FIRST OF ALL THE COLOR CODING IS PRETTY CLO COOL ON -- COOL ON THE SITE PLANS TO SEE THAT AND WHEN I SAW THE COLOR CODING ON THE DIFFERENT UNITS AND WHEN I SAW TWO KITCHENS WITHIN THEM I WAS LIKE WHAT IS THAT AND SO THAT -- AND THEN I LOOKED CLOSER AND I SAW, IT'S SUPER SMART DESIGN AND IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO ADAPT AND MAYBE OUR ORDNANCE WILL CHANGE AND I APPRECIATE THAT AND SO YOU'RE AWARE THAT THAT IS NOT POSSIBLE NOW I'M OKAY WITH THAT. I'M BRINGING IT TO OUR ATTENTION BECAUSE AS COMMISSIONER SAUVE SAID AND ONE OF THE CALLERS SAID, YOU WILL PROPOSALS FROM ME LATER TO TALK ABOUT WHETHER WE REGULATE THINGS BY UNITS OR BY BEDROOMS AND SO I'M JUST GOING TO -- TO SAY THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF, YOU KNOW, THERE'S NOT AS MUCH OF A MARKET, WE JUST HEARD, RIGHT, FOR -- SIX BEDROOM UNITS AS THERE ARE FOR SMALLER AND IN THIS SITUATION I AM NOT AT ALL WORRIED ABOUT PARKING BUT BECAUSE THERE IS A MULTIPLIER, IF THIS BECOMES AND -- AND OUR MULTIPLIER IS BASED ON UNIT, NOT UNIT SIZE, WHETHER THEY'RE BUILDING EFFICIENCY APARTMENTS OR SIX BEDROOM APARTMENTS THEY HAVE TO HAVE ADDITIONAL PARKING AND THERE'S OTHER PARTS OF THE CITY WHERE THAT THEY BE A BIG DEAL.
01:51:47.853: >> IT'S EXPENSIVE.  ESPECIALLY THE UNDERGROUND PARKING.  I WOULD MUCH RATHER SPEND MY MONEY ELSEWHERE THAN ON UNDERGROUND PARKING.
01:51:59.098: >> I WOULD MUCH RATHER THAT YOU SPEND IT ELSEWHERE AND I'M GLAD IT'S NOT ON THE PARKING AND THAT CIRCLES BACK TO A QUESTION I HAVE.  THANK YOU, COMMISSIONERS, I DO LIKE GOING LAST IN THIS BECAUSE THE IDEA OF HAVING -- IF YOU HAVE A CAR SHARE, HOW DO THEY BACK OUT INTO THE GARAGE IF THEY DON'T HAVE A REMOTE, AWESOME DISCUSSION, YOU TOOK CARE OF THAT.  I HAD A SIMILAR QUESTION ABOUT THE PARKING IN -- LIKE THE LOOP, LIKE WHERE PACKAGES GO AND LIKE, ARE THEY GOING TO USE THE LOOP AND SO MOVING THAT AROUND I THINK IS GREAT.  THANK YOU FOR RAISING ALL OF THAT.  I WOULD SAY TO THE NEIGHBORS, THEY'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE PARKING IN THAT LOOP, DEFINITELY NOT PARKING OVER THE SIDEWALK IN THE LOOP.  IF YOU SEE IT, AND BEFORE BUILDING OWNER DOES, LIKE, THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN CALL, LIKE YOU CAN REPORT IN.  BECAUSE THERE'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE PARKING OVER THE SIDEWALK IN PARTICULAR.  AND THERE'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE PARKING IN  FRONT YARDS.  THAT'S NOT DESIGNED AS A PARKING SPACE. THAT'S MORE FOR NEIGHBORS TO KEEP IN MIND.  I'M CURIOUS THOUGH, ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE THINKING THAT YOUR MARKET IS STUDENTS, LIKE, I, AGAIN, THAT YOU HAVE PLANS FOR DROP-OFFS.  I LOVE THE LOOP FOR THINKING ABOUT, YOU KNOW, UBERS AND ALL OF THAT AND PACKAGE DELIVERY.  I THINK THAT THAT'S FANTASTIC. WHAT ABOUT PARENTS.  WHERE ARE PARENTS PARKING.
01:53:36.562: >> THE PARKING WE HAVE IS ALL WE HAVE TO OFFER.  WE'RE GOING TO REGULAR -- REGULATE THAT CIRCULAR DRIVING AREA IS NOT A, PA -- PARKING AREA.  THAT'S REALLY ALL WE CAN DO.  THERE'S REALLY NOT MUCH -- FOOTBALL SATURDAYS AND SO ON, I COULD SEE SOME KIDS -- ENTREPRENEURIAL KIDS WANTING TO --
01:54:06.925: >> FIFTEEN BUCKS.
01:54:08.360: >> PUT CARS IN THAT CIRCULAR DRIVEWAY BUT WE'RE JUST NOT GOING TO LET IT HAPPEN AND, UNFORTUNATELY, THAT'S ONE OF THE CONSTRAINTS OF THE LOT.  AND ANOTHER THING ABOUT AN ARBOR IS REALLY THE LAND VALUES ARE SO HIGH THAT IT'S UNECONOMICAL REALLY TO DO, YOU KNOW, IF I WANTED TO HAVE, LIKE, TWO BEDROOM APARTMENTS FOR EXAMPLE IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE AND I THINK IN THE LONG RUN IT LIMITS SUPPLY AND IT IS EXCEEDINGLY HIGH RELATIVE TO OTHER COL COLLECOLLEGES. WE HAVE SEVEN SPOTS.  SIX ARE ALLOCATED.  I'M NOT SURE WHAT TO DO WITH THE SEVENTH SPOT AND TWO HOPEFULLY FOR CAR SHARING.
01:54:58.577: >> MOM AND DAD UBER FROM THE HOTEL.  WHAT I ALSO HEARD AND WANT TO DRAW ATTENTION TO IS PARKING.  WE'RE HEARING A DEVELOPER SAYING THAT IS NOT -- THEY'RE STILL ABLE TO BUILD IT. SO AND THAT PARKING IS EXPENSIVE.  PARKING SPACES ARE NOT FREE.  THEY DO COST SOMETHING.  SO --
01:55:19.298: >> RIGHT.
01:55:20.432: >> SO THAT ADDRESSES THAT QUESTION.  I WONDER, I APPRECIATE THAT YOU HAVE MORE BIKE PARKING THAN WHAT IS REQUIRED BECAUSE HONESTLY FOR THIS PARTICULAR AREA WE DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH BIKE PARKING REQUIRED.  I -- MISS COMMISSIONER WEATHERBEE'S KNOWLEDGE TO KNOW WHETHER THAT IS ENOUGH.  I, LIKE ALL THE TIME, I CAN'T REALLY REMEMBER WHAT THE MO IS THERE BUT WITH 36 UNITS I'M NOT SURE IF EIGHT SPOTS IS ENOUGH SO YOU MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT WHERE ELSE THEY WILL GO.  I LOVE THAT THEY ARE ACCESSIBLE.  LIKE, THAT THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY TUCKED IN THE BACK OF THE GARAGE, YOU KNOW, REALLY HARD TO GET TO.  I THINK THAT'S A REALLY GOOD DESIGN.  OTHERWISE YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE THINGS LIKE CHANGE TO TREES OR IN THE MIDDLE OF YOUR -- YOU KNOW, ALONG THE EDGES OF YOUR LOOP WHICH YOU MAY NOW WANT.  SO LIKE I WOULD PLAN FOR WHERE PEOPLE SHOULD PUT THOSE -- THE EIGHT BIKES -- LIKE SPOTS THAT ARE AVAILABLE IN YOUR BIKE GARAGE.
01:56:33.872: >> KEVIN I THINK YOU AND I TALKED ABOUT THIS.  WE'LL TAKE THAT UNDER ADVISEMENT.  I ACOMBRAE WITH YOU.  I THINK WE SHOULD TRY TO HAVE MORE AND WE COULD COME BACK TO YOU AS PART OF THE --
01:56:44.550: >> YEAH LIKE I SAID, I THINK WE COULD ADD THREE TO FOUR MORE. WE COULD GET MAYBE TWELVE IN THERE.  WE DO HAVE THE AREA UNDER THE DECK THAT WE ALWAYS -- THAT RAISED DECK THERE THAT WE COULD DO UNSECURED PARKING, BIKE PARKING SO WE CAN LOOK INTO THAT TOO.  SO --
01:57:02.768: >> I MEAN, WHEN I DRIVE DOWN MAIN STREET THERE ARE A LOT OF BIKES PARKED BY THE FRONT DOORS BECAUSE THAT'S CONVENIENT. WHERE YOU HAVE IT IN THE DPGARA IS FANTASTIC AND SOME PEOPLE WILL WANT IT SECURED.  OTHER PEOPLE WILL USE THE BIKE LOCK AND PUTTING IT IN A CONVENIENT PLACE WHICH MEANS IT'S CHAINED BY THE FRONT DOOR.  SO IT DOESN'T RUIN YOUR LANDSCAPING AND OTHER PLANS AND THE FINAL TI THAT I HAD IS ON SOLAR BECAUSE I THINK IT'S GREAT THAT YOU HAVE SOLAR PANELS.  AND AT FIRST I WAS READING THE PLAN WRONG AND NOW I SEE THAT IT'S 20 KILOWATTS TOTAL WHICH -- FOR, LIKE, A GENERAL HOUSE WOULD HAVE AROUND 10 KILOWATTS SO THE IDEA THAT IT MIGHT -- TYPICALLY WHEN WE THINK OF 50 -- WHEN YOU WERE SAYING IT WAS ABOUT 50%.  THAT'S NOT HOW -- USUALLY KILOWATT HOURS IS WHAT I THINK OF.
01:57:59.891: >> YEAH.  YEAH.
01:58:01.059: >> THIS SEESONABLE TO ME. ATTACHED UNITS WILL TAKE LESS. I BUY IT ALTHOUGH YOU MIGHT CONSIDER WHAT A THE GENERATION WOULD BE AS YOU DO THAT CALCULATION.  SO THIS IS MORE OF A UTILITIES, LIKE,ONKY QUESTION IS WHAT I HEAR BECAUSE THAT'S TRICKY.  WHAT ARE UTILITIES METERED AN ARE YOU PLNING TO HAVE THEM METERED AND WHO GETS THOSE THAT ARE GERATED.  ARE TSE INCLUDED OR DOOU ADD THEM TO THEOLAR QUESTION.HE UNIT IS THE
01:58:37.362: >> , W, I MAY HE TO COME BACK TO YOU ON THIS I HAVEN'T -- I DIDN' -- I HAD N THOUT ABOUT THE ALLATION OR WHETR WE WOULD -- GENERALLY SPEAK 'S NOT INCLUDED BUT WITH SOLAR IAY BE WILLIN TO TAKE THE PENSE ON.  I HAVE A FEW UNITS WHERE 'S NOT INCLUDED I MAY HAVE TO COM BACK T THIS. YORE RAISING QSTIONS THAT I ANSWERS.  WILL COME BACKO YOU INN-MAIL, WOULD THAT BE OKAY.
01:59:22.741: >> I WOULDAY HOW WILLOU ALLOCA IT AND USE IT FIT TO THE GRID?E'RE IN A TLY SITUATION OF N METING S YOU CAN SE EXCESS IF FORXAMPLE SOMEBO IS NOT CHAINGHEIR CAR RIT NOW.  LIKE?  OR YOU DON'T HAVE THE Y - THE PAR OF THE SLLIGHTS FOR THE BUILDIN THAT YOU COVER.  THAT'S ON THE METER THAT YOU'RE PAYING.  BUT WITH THAT SIZE OF SYSTEM, LIKE, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF EXCESS.  YOU'RE NOT GOING TO USE THAT MUCH EXTERIOR LIGHTING. YOU DON'T HAVE ANTERIOR HIGH HALLWAYS THAT YOU'RE LIGHTING. I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU'LL USE THAT MUCH YOURSELF.  SO IF YOU CAN USE IT ONSITE FIRST IT'LL MAKE THOSE SOLAR PANELS MORE AFFORDABLE AND THIS IS WHY YOU GOT TO FIGURE OUT WHO GETS IT AND WHAT I'VE OFTEN HEARD AND THE REASON THAT I'M ASKING YOU THIS IS THAT THE ARGUMENT SOMETIMES AGAINST THIS IN A BIGGER APARTMENT BUILDING IS, LIKE, WE CAN'T ADD THAT MANY SOLAR PANELS BECAUSE HOW DO WE AL ROW -- ALLOCATE IT AND ANYWAY.  IT'S FANTASTIC. I WANT TO TRY TO LEARN FROM YOU IS THE BASIC GIST THERE.
02:00:35.981: >> WELL MY THOUGHT IS --
02:00:37.182: >> GO AHEAD.
02:00:37.816: >> SORRY.  MY THOUGHT IS WE HAVE A SERVICE COMING IN AND I THINK IF WE CAN TAP INTO THE SERVICE PRIOR TO THE -- YOU KNOW, THE METER BANK, THAT COULD BE MY THING.  AGAIN, I'VE DONE SOLAR BUT I'VE NOT DONE SOLAR WITH A MULTITENANT BUILDING.  IT'S A LEARNING CURVE FOR ME AND MY THOUGHT IS WE WOULD DO THIS PRIOR TO THE METER BANK SO EVERYONE CAN, YOU KNOW, BENEFIT FROM THAT.  OKAY?  SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WILL WORK WITH THE SOLAR COMPANY.  WE'VE GOT ONE ON BOARD THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING TO PRELIMINARILY.  SO MAYBE THAT'S SOMETHING WE'LL HAVE TO DRESS IT DOWN.  BUT THAT'S A GOOD POINT. ABSOLUTELY.
02:01:19.357: >> AGAIN, SOLAR PANELS WILL PAY FOR THEMSELVES A LOT FASTER IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO SELL, IF YOU CAN USE IT.
02:01:27.098: >> ABSOLUTELY.  I DON'T WANT TO SELL IT.  WE WANT TO USE IT FOR OUR PROJECT.  THAT'S A GREAT POINT.  BECAUSE THAT'S A BENEFIT FOR OUR -- FOR THE TENANTS, FOR THE MOM AND DADS SENDING THE KIDS TO THIS BUILDING BECAUSE THEY KNOW, YOU KNOW, IT'S A BENEFIT.
02:01:42.848: >> YEAH.
02:01:43.081: >> THIS MAKES A STRONG ARGUMENT FOR JUST INCLUDING UTILITIES INTO THE RENT.  I THINK -- AS I HEAR THIS DISCUSSION AND THAT MAY BE THE ROUTE WE GO IN THIS PATH.  THAT FEELS LIKE IT'S PROBABLY THE EASIEST ANSWER IF YOU WANT TO MAXIMIZE OR REDUCE THE RETURN ON INVESTMENT ON SOLAR AND ALSO MAXIMIZE OUR -- I'M ASSUMING THAT THE POWER COMPANY'S GOING TO PAY ME LESS THAN WHAT THEY CHARGE.  SO -- YEAH, I THINK -- AS I THINK ABOUT IT A LITTLE BIT MORE AND I WANT TO THINK ABOUT IT FURTHER AND TALK TO OXFORD ABOUT IT IT WILL PROBABLY MAKE THE MOST SENSE TO PROVIDE THE ELECTRICITY AS PART OF THE RENT.
02:02:23.321: >> ANOTHER REASON I'M NOT PUSHING YOU ON THIS, AS FORCEFULLY AS SOME OTHERS HAVE BUT, AGAIN, IF YOU'RE THAT -- INCLUDING IT I KNOW THAT ELECTRIFYING THE HVAC SYSTEMS CAN -- BUT THAT IS ANOTHER USE FOR THAT POWER.  AND IT'S OFFSETTING THAT UTILITY.  SO LIKE ALL OF THESE THINGS KIND OF GO HAND IN HAND TOGETHER. THE -- WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF ADDITIONAL ENERGY EFFICIENCY, YOU'RE ALREADY DOING THAT.  YOU'RE PAYING THE UPFRONT COSTS, RIGHT? LIKE INCLUDING UTILITIES LIKE THE UTILITIES IN YOUR BUILDING AREN'T GOING TO BE AS EXPENSIVE AS IN ANOTHER BUILDING THAT DOESN'T HAVE THAT S THAT ALL BUILT IN.  I DON'T KNOW. JUST SOMETHING TO --
02:03:05.530: >> I THINK THAT'S RIGHT.
02:03:06.364: >> FOOD FOR THOUGHT.  BECAUSE I THINK THAT THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY.
02:03:09.834: >> THERE'S A WHOLE PROCESS OF UNDERSTANDING AND PUTTING IT ALTOGETHER FOR SURE.
02:03:16.908: >> YEAH.
02:03:18.443: >> I THINK WE WERE HOPING.  WE PUT DOWN 20KW RIGHT NOW.  BUT MAYBE THERE'S REFINEMENT FOR A LITTLE BIT MORE POWER GENERATION AS WELL.  WE HAVEN'T DONE ALL THE CALCULATIONS.  THAT WILL PAY -- PLAY IN THE ANALYSIS.  I AM FAVORED TO IT INCLUDING UTILITIES. IT WILL ALL WASH OUT IN THE END IN TERMS OF THE STUDENTS.
02:03:50.475: >> IT MAY.  SO, AGAIN, I -- THE KIND OF DESIGN, THE INTERIOR DESIGN WHICH IS NOT THE NORMAL THING WE LOOK AT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CAUGHT MY ATTENTION AND I THINK IT'S MORE AGAIN, HIGHLIGHTING WHERE OUR CODE IS LEADING TO SOME INTERESTING ODDITIES.  NOT, AGAIN, YOU DID WHAT -- YOU HAVE SIX UNITS THAT IS WHAT IS ALLOWED HERE.  YOU DO NOT HAVE MORE THAN 36, THAT IS WHAT IS ALLOWED HERE.  IT JUST HIGHLIGHTS WHERE OUR CODE HAS ODDITIES WHICH WE MAY NEED TO ADDRESS.  I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS AS WELL.  DOES ANYONE ELSE HAVE ANY COMMENTS?  QSTIONS THINK WE'RE READY FOR A VOTE THEN MR. LENART.
02:04:49.968: >> OKAY.  COMMISSIONER MILLS.

02:05:32.477: >> OKAY.
02:05:33.144: >> EXCELLENT.  THANK YOU.  WE WILL SIGN OFF.
02:05:37.549: >> ALL RIGHT.  THE NEXT ITEM IS THE 10A, OTHER BUSINESS.  WHICH IS THE REVIEW, COMMENT AND RECOMMENDATION TO FORWARD THE ANN AR BOAR MOVING TOGETHER TOWARDS VISION ZERO: CITY OF ANN ARBOR COMPREHENSIVE TRANSPORTATION PLAN TO CITY COUNCIL FOR DISTRIBUTION AND PUBLIC COMMENTS.  SOUNDS LIKE WE HAVE MR. COOPER TO GIVE A PRESENTATION UP TO FIFTEEN MINUTES FOR US TO FILL IN THE PLANNING PERSPECTIVE AND THEN WE'LL HAVE A PUBLIC HEARING.
02:06:19.357: >> OKAY, I GUESS THAT'S MY CUE TO MOVE FORWARD.
02:06:21.960: >> OKAY, DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO SCREEN SHARE FOR US?
02:06:26.197: >> I'M TRYING TO GET STACEY SET UP HERE TO DO THAT.  SARA, YOU MIGHT HAVE TO DO THAT NOW BECAUSE YOU ARE THE HOST AND I AM NOW THE COHOST.  CAN YOU GIVE STACEY COHOST APPROVAL.
02:06:38.743: >> I AM GOING TO MAKE YOU HOST.
02:06:40.278: >> OKAY.
02:06:42.714: >> BUT I --
02:06:43.448: >> YEAH.  THAT WORKED.
02:07:02.734: >> IT'S AMAZING THAT NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE TO PUT UP WITH THE PANDEMIC BUT WE HAVE TO PUT UP WITH THE PANDEMIC AS WELL.
02:07:12.177: >> CAN YOU GUYS HEAR ME?
02:07:14.512: >> YES.
02:07:17.549: >> OKAY.  I SEE THE TITLE SLIDE I THINK.
02:07:33.765: >> GOOD EVENING, FOR THOSE IN THE PUBLIC, MY NAME IS ELI COOPER AND I'M THE CITY'S TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM MANAGER AND WITH ME IS STACEY FROM SCHWARTZ CONSULTING AND BEEN A PROJECT MANAGER ON OUR CITY TRANSPORTATION PLAN UPDATE PROJECT. I'M EXCITED TO BE BACK IN FRONT OF THE PLANNING COMMISSION THIS EVENING WITH THIS PLAN AS WE'VE MADE SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS SINCE OUR WORKING SESSION WITH YOU BACK IN OCTOBER.  RATHER THAN ADDING TO THE TIME OF THE MEETING AT THIS LATE MOMENT, I WILL JUST TURN IT OVER TO STACEY WHO WILL WALK US THROUGH PRESENTATION AND WE SHE -- SHE AND I WILL BE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AFTERWARDS. AGAIN, THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION HERE THIS EVENING AND NOW I WILL TURN IT OVER TO STACEY.
02:08:28.887: >> THANKS, ELI AND THANK YOU, ALL, FOR HAVING US.  AS ELI MENTIONED, WE WERE HERE WITH YOU IN OCTOBER AND ONE OF THE THINGS, ARE YOU STILL SEEING THE PLANNING COMMISSION SLIDE NOW? IT SAYS MY SCREEN SHARING IS PAUSED.  YOU'RE NOT SEEING IT.
02:08:49.140: >> NO.
02:08:52.110: >> OH.  THERE WE ARE, I MUST HAVE HIT PAUSE BY ACCIDENT. WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS SINCE THAT HAPPENED IN OCTOBER AND GIVE YOU AN OVERVIEW OF THE DOCUMENT ITSELF AND OPEN IT UP FOR QUESTIONS.  SO THIS IS A SLIDE THAT YOU SAW LAST TIME.  I HAVE IT UP HERE FOR REFERENCE AND WE CAN COME BACK TO IT IF WE NEED TO.  I WASN'T PLANNING TO WALK THROUGH IT AGAIN BUT JUST AT THE VERY QUICK HIGH LEVEL WE HAD THESE THREE BASIC PHASES OF THE PLAN.  WE ARE NOW AT THE TAIL ENDOF THE ACTION PLANNING PHASE AND HAVE A DRAFT PLAN FOR CONSIDERATION. SO SINCE WE LAST MET IN OCTOBER, WE WENT AND TOOK THE DRAFT PLAN TO THE TECHNICAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON OCTOBER 21ST.  AND THEN THE COMMUNITY ADVISORY COMMITTEE THAT NEXT DAY ON THE 22ND.  WE HAVE HAD SEVERAL ADDITIONAL ONE-ON-ONE STAKEHOLDER COORDINATION MEETINGS.  PTICULARLY WITH U OF M AND TRIPLE ATA.  AND HAVE HAD SOME OTHER CORRESPONDENCE VIA E-MAIL WITH OTHER STAKEHOLDERS AND HAD A VIRTUAL PUBLIC MEETING ON OCTOBER 29TH AND ACTUALLY WENT TO THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION TWICE SINCE OUR LAST MEETING ONCE ON THE THE 21ST AND ONE ON NOVEMBER 18TH. O AT EACH OF THOSE STEPS WE'VE BEEN REFINING THE PLAN BASE O CMENTS AND HAVE GOTTEN A L OF GREAT FEEDBACK THAT ISAKING IT STRONGER. O I DON'T HAV A SLIDE TO GO OVER EVERSINGLE COMPONT OF THE PLAN.  HOPEFUL YOU HAVE HAD A CHANCE TO FLIP THRGH IT.  I DON'T EXPECT YOU'VE READ IT WORD THAT'S GAT. UT IT IS U HAD AVAILABLE ONHE WEBSITEF YOU HA NOT HAD A CHANCE TO LOOK A IT YET.  D I'M JUST GOING T HISOME HIGIGHTS HERE D JU GIVEOU KIND OF GLIMPSE OFHAT THE PLAN ISETTING THE CITY WARDS.  SO THISLIDE SHOW THEABLE OFCONTENTS. E HAVE SORT O AN INTRODUCTI, A BRIEFOVEREW OF MOBILITY IN ANARBOR TODAYND THAT RLLY SUMMARIZESNARLIER DELIRABLE WHICH WAS FULLY EXISTING CONDITIONS DOCUMENT ICH IS STILL AVAABLE ON T ABOUT THE MILITY OF VAES AND TH GLS THAT DROVE THE PLAN. AND THEN TULK OHE PLAN IS SECTN FOU WHI ARE THE MOBILITY STTEGIES.  SECTION FIVE SWS SOME CONCEPTUAL PLANS -- CCEPTUAL DRAWINGF WHAT THOSE STRATEGIES WOULD LOOK LIKE ON THE GROUND IN ANN ARBOR AND THEN THAT FINAL SECTION IS ABOUT HOW WILL WE MAKE IT HAPPEN.  SO THAT INCLUDES COST ESTIMATES.  SOME DISCUSSION OF FUNDING AND PLAN DEVELOPMENT PROCESS.  SO TO START OFF, WE HAVE A -- AN OVERVIEW OF HOW THE STRATEGIES COALESCE INTO PROJECTS IN ANN ARBOR.  THIS IS NOT REALLY A PLAN OF ADDING ON, YOU KNOW, ONE CAPITAL PROJECT AFTER ANOTHER.  IT'S REALLY A PLAN THAT TAKES A SAFE-SYSTEMS APPROACH AND ENCOURAGES A NEW WAY OF DOING THE SAME KIND OF WORK THAT YOU'RE ALREADY DOING. SO IT'S ABOUT LOOKING AT HOW DO WE IMPROVE PEDESTRIAN ACCESSIBILITY ON EVERY PROJECT. BUT AT THE SAME TIME, IT IS ABOUT SPECIFIC PROJECTS THAT ARE NEEDED TO ADDRESS SPECIFIC SAFETY NEEDS.  SO IT DOES TAKE A DATA-DRIVEN APPROACH TO IDENTIFY SPECIFIC AREAS.  WE IDENTIFIED TARGET FOCUS CORRIDORS AND FOCUS INTERSECTIONS WHERE THE CRASH DATA INDICATES THAT THERE'S A SAFETY ISSUE.  SO ALL TOLD, YOU KNOW, WHEN WE COMPILED ALL THE STRATEGIES AND WHERE THAT IS RECOMMENDING A PHYSICAL CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT, WE'RE DISPLAYING IT HERE IN THIS MAP AS TIER ONE, TIER TWO OR TIER THREE CAPITAL PROJECTS.  SO THIS DOES NOT JUST INCLUDE THOSE CORRIDOR PROJECTS THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED.  IT ALSO INCLUDES BIKE ROUTE RECOMMENDATIONS, IT INCLUDES CROSSWALK RECOMMENDATIONS, SIDEWALK IMPROVEMENTS, OR SIDEWALK GAP INFILL.  AND SO JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT DOOR DOOR IMPROVEMENTS.  THIS MAP IS INTENDED TO SHOW THE CULMINATION OF ALL THE CAPITAL PROJECTS. SO THAT MOBILITY IN ANN ARBOR TODAY SECTION, ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK I STRESSED LAST TIME BUT I WANT TO REITERATE IT TONIGHT IS THAT ONE THING THAT WE FOUND IS THAT THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR HAS BEEN VERY PROACTIVE ABOUT MAKING IMPROVEMENTS AND INVESTMENTS AND SO WE DID SEE A LOT OF CHANGES SINCE THE LAST COMPREHENSIVE PLAN AND ALSO SINCE THE NONMOTORIZED PLAN AND THAT IS REALLY YIELDING SOME DISTINCT RESULTS.  BUT THE CITY ALSO HAS AMBITIOUS GOALS AND SO WE HAVE SOME MORE WORK TO DO. THE OVERARCHING GOALS THAT DROVE THIS PLAN ARE ZERO DEATHS AND ZERO EMISSIONS.  AND THEN WE ALSO DRILLED DOWN INTO SOME -- THE VALUES THAT THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR HOLDS DEAR AND SO WE TOOK THIS TO THE PUBLIC.  WE TOOK THIS TO BOTH COMMITTEES AND ASKED EVERYBODY WHAT ARE THE VALUES THAT THE PLAN SHOULD TAKE TO HEART AND SO WE ENDED UP WITH THESE FIVE.  SACHTY, MOBILITY, ACCESSIBILITY FOR ALL, HEALTHY PEOPLE, REGIONAL CONNECTIVITY. YOU'LL SEE THESE THROUGHOUT THE PLAN.  WE ENDED UP WITH 22 KEY STRATEGIES BUT I THINK UP TO 77 STRATEGIES OVERALL. AND EACH STRATEGY WE DEMONSTRATE HOW IT DOES RELATE TO THOSE VALUES AND A LOT OF THEM CROSS CUT MULTIPLE VALUES.  WE ALSO DEMONSTRATE HOW THIS IS A MULTIDISCIPLINARY APPROACH.  SO WHILE I SHOWED YOU A MAP OF CAPITAL PROJECTS, THAT IS NOT THE EXTENT OF THE PLAN, WE ALSO ARE TALKING ABOUT EDUCATION STRATEGIES, ENCOURAGEMENT, ENFORCEMENT.  WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW TO DO THINGS MORE EQUITABLY AND HOW TO HOLD THE CITY ACCOUNTABLE.  EVERY STRATEGY ALSO INDICATES WHO ARE THE KEY PARTNERS AND STAKEHOLDERS AND IT'S ALSO LAID OUT ACROSS A TIMELINE OF SHORT, MID OR LONG-TERM STRATEGIES AND THOSE INDICATE WHEN THAT STRATEGY SHOULD BEGIN.  AND THEN FINALLY WE ARE -- AS I ALREADY MENTIONED, WE BUILT IN SOME ACCOUNTABILITY SO EVERY STRATEGY HAS SOME METRICS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT STRATEGY.  WE'VE ALSO ASSOCIATED METRICS AT THE VALUE LEVEL SO THE CITY CAN EVALUATE AS YOU MOVE ALONG IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PLAN.  ARE WE ACHIEVING A MORE SAFE CITY? ARE WAY ALSO ACHIEVING A MORE ACCESSIBLE CITY?  A MORE HEALTHY PEOPLE, SUSTAINABLE PLACES?  AND EVALUATE THE PROGRESS THAT WAY. SO THIS IS WHAT ONE OF THOSE KEY STRATEGIES LOOKS LIKE.  THERE'S KIND OF A SHORTHAND NAME, THE 13 COMMUTER TRANSIT.  AND THEN JUST BELOW THAT IS THE FULL NAME OF THAT STRATEGY.  WE LAY OUT WHERE THE CITY IS NOW WITH RESPECT TO THAT STRATEGY.  AND THEN WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED IN THE STRATEGY DESCRIPTION.  AND THEN OVER HERE AT THE TOP ARE THE VALUES THAT THAT STRATEGY RELATES TO.  AND THEN WITH EACH STRATEGY, WE HAVE THE TIMELINE, THE LEAD AGENCY, AS WELL AS THE STAKEHOLDERS WHO SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN ACHIEVING THAT STRATEGY.  AND THE TARGETS. THE METRICS FOR EACH STRATEGY. THIS IS A SAMPLE PAGE, I MENTIONED THE 22 KEY STRATEGIES THAT HAVE THE TREATMENT OF THE IN-DEPTH EXPLANATION AND THEN THE FULL STRATEGIES WE LAID OUT A FULL MAET  MATRIX OF WHO IS LEADING THAT STRATEGY AND WHO ARE THE PARTNERS.  WHAT IS THE VALUE OR VALUES THAT IT SPEAKS TO?  WHAT ARE THE DISCIPLINES THAT ARE REPRESENTED FOR THAT STRATEGY?  AND THE TARGETS.  AND THEN IN THAT FINAL SECTION AS I MENTIONED, WE HAVE COST ESTIMATES AND THE WAY THAT WE'RE PRESENTING THESE ARE IN TWO DIFFERENT WAYS.  YOU SEE HERE IN THE THIRD -- THE MIDDLE COLUMN OF THIS MATRIX, A COST OVERVIEW AND THAT GIVES A COST THAT EITHER PER ITEM OR PER INTERSECTION.  SO THIS FIRST ONE, FOR EXAMPLE, IS THE STRATEGY IS TO FOCUS IMPROVEMENTS ON THE KEY CORRIDORS AND INTERSECTIONS WHERE WE FOUND THE MOST CRASHES. AND THAT HAS A RANGE AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT, THAT'S GOING TO -- DEPENDING ON WHAT THE ISSUES ARE AND WHAT THE CORRIDOR LOOKS LIKE, THAT'S GOING TO HAVE A RANGE OF ANYWHERE FROM 100,000 TO OVER A MILLION DOLLARS PER MILE.  AND THE INTERSECTION LOOKS LIKE THERE'S A LITTLE TYPO IN THIS ONE.  THE INTERSECTION HAS A RANGE AS WELL BUT THEN IN THAT FINAL COLUMN, WE HAVE PROPOSED AN ESTIMATED INVESTMENT EITHER ON AN ANNUAL BASIS OR IN SOME CASES, IT'S JUST A ONE TIME INVESTMENT.  AND THAT IS THE PROPOSED INVESTMENT TO GET THE CITY LAID OUT IN THE PLAN.  AND SO THAT IS ALL THE SLIDES THAT I PREPARED.  I AM HAPPY TO OPEN IT UP TO QUESTIONS.
02:20:55.032: >> GREAT, THANK YOU. MR. LENART, DO WE DO THE NORMAL KIND OF ORDER WHERE YOU'LL GO NEXT AND THEN WE DO THE PUBLIC HEARING AND THEN WE ASK QUESTIONS?
02:21:03.974: >> YES, PLEASE.
02:21:05.709: >> ALL RIGHT.
02:21:06.677: >> SO I JUST WANTED TO FRAME THIS A LITTLE BIT FOR THE PLANNING COMMISSION AS A REMINDER WE DON'T DO MASTER PLANNING A LOT SO I WANT TO GIVE YOU A QUICK REMINDER OR A PRIMER ON WHAT THE PROCESS IS.  SO MASTER PLANNING IS GOVERNED BY THE ENABLING ACT WHICH DESCRIBES PRETTY DETAILED PROCESS BY WHICH MASTER PLANS ARE CONSIDERED AND ADOPTED BY COMMUNITIES.  AT THE OUTSET OF THIS PROCESS ACTUALLY THE CITY NOTIFIED A VARIETY OF ADJACENT COMMUNITIES, STAKEHOLDERS, AGENCIES THAT WE INTENDED TO UNDERTAKE A MASTER PLAN PROCESS TO UPDATE OUR TRANSPORTATION PLAN.  ELI, STACEY AND A WIDE VARIETY OF OTHER TEAM MEMBERS HAVE WORKED DILIGENTLY AT THAT AND PUT TOGETHER THIS PLAN WHICH IS NOW ENTERING THE ADOPTION PHASE OF THAT PROCESS SO THIS STEP THIS EVENING IS PRESCRIBED BY THAT SAME STATE ACT AND IT IS THE PLANNING COMMISSION'S OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT, REVIEW AND RECOMMEND TO THE CITY COUNCIL THAT THIS VERSION OF THE DOCUMENT, THE PLAN INTENDED TO BE ADOPTED BY DISTRIBUTED TO THOSE SAME GROUPS, OTHER COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND PROVIDES A WINDOW OF ABOUT TWO MONTHS OF PUBLIC COMMENT BY ANYBODY WHO WANTS TO RAISE QUESTIONS ON THE PLAN.  THAT PLAN THEN WILL COME BACK TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION WHERE YOU WILL BE THE ENTITY THAT MAKES THE ADOPTION OF THE FINAL VERSION AS THE MASTER PLAN AND THEN THAT PROCEEDS TO CITY COUNCIL FOR A SORT OF UP OR DOWN VOTE AND INHE EVENT THAT THAT IS A DOWN VOTE THEN CITY COUNCIL MIGHT PROVIDE OTHER DIRECTIS D THEN UNDERTAKE TH WORK. THAT'S AN OVERVIEW OF THE PROCESS.  THE PLAN ITSF FOR THOSE, GENERALLY, JUST MY OBSEATIONS ON THE PLA IS I THINIT'S A FANSTIC ACCESSIBLEDOCUMENT IEALLY COUPLE OF POINTS I WANT TO   A HILIGHT.  A LOT OF IT IS WORK THAT THE PNNING COMMISON WON'T BE INVOLVED INFRANKL  A LOT OF INFRASTCTURE TYPE RK. BUT A LOT OF COMNENTS THAT ARE TO T COMMISSION PLAN INHE CONG YES.  THERE'S LOT OF FERENCE TO CREASINGRANSIT AND THE TE OF LA USE PATTNS THAT SPORT TRANSIT OFHOSE ALTERNAEANS OF I SOME TRANSPORTION TO PARTICULARL HELP AANCE PBABLY OUR ZERO EMISSION GOA SO THAT IS GOI PLANNINGCOMMISON'SAKINGP THIS DOCUMT AS POLICY GUIDE. AFTER ITS APTION.  THE SOND IS RELED TO THAT SPIFICALLY AS A STRATY ISHE NOTIO OF WILL OUR LANDSE PATRNS W PROVING THOSE MIX OF ES? FOSTER ANDEQUIRE BUIINGS VERSUS AREAS.  THAT WILCOME INTO PLAY AS WE LOOK INTO TRANSIT ZONING AS ALREADY IDENTIFIED IN THE WORK PLAN. ANOTHER COMMON ELEMENT FROM THIS PLAN AND YOUR WORK PLAN IS PARKING.  THIS PLAN IS MORE FOCUSED IN SETTING A GOAL THAT PARKING MINIMUM SHOULD BE ELIMINATED TOWARD THE MT AND THE RELATED BENEFITS OF THAT.  THAT SO THAT IS DEFINITELY GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT IS THE PLANNING COMMISSION IS GOING TO BE LOOKING AT AND FINALLY I WOULD JUST SAY THAT MY -- AND I'VE HAD A VERY HIGH LEVEL CONVERSATION WITH ELI ABOUT THIS.  AS WE GO FORWARD WITH THE ADOPTION OF THIS PLAN WHICH I CERTAINLY HOPE THAT WE DO, WE -- I THINK WE WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR AND DELIBERATE ABOUT THE POLICIES THAT THIS SETS FORTH AND HOW WE PERHAPS LEAVE SOME OF OUR PATHS, TRANSPORTATION PLANNING EFFORTS IN THE PAST. I, AS YOU KNOW I AM VERY SENSITIVE TO ADDING TO OUR CAN NONOF POLICY USE AND THE LIKE AND THAT'S SHING I WOULD LIKE US TO BE CONSIDERATE OF AND THAT HAPPENS IN THE RESOLUTION OF ADOPTION MORE SO THAN THIS DOCUMENT ITSELF. AND THEN THE OTHER OBSERVATION I WOULD HAVE IS THAT I THINK THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY ACCESSIBLE DOCUMENT.  I LIKE THE VISUALS. IT'S STILL 200 PAGES.  YOU KNOW, WHEN WE STARTED OUR -- ASPIRATION WAS TO REDUCE THE LAND USE POLICIES ACROSS THE CITY TO ABOUT ONE HUNDRED PAGES. I THINK THAT THAT SHOWS THAT AS WE GO FORWARD WITH THE MASTER PLANNING OUR WORK'S CUT OUT FOR US IN THE WAY THAT WE CAN GET ALL OF THE PERTINENT INFORMATION, BACKGROUND, POLICIES AND EXAMPLES IN, FRANKLY TIGHT, ACCESSIBLE, SHORT MANNER SO THAT IT'S EASILY USED BY YOU FOR FUTURE DECISION-MAKING, THE CITY COUNCIL FOR FUTURE DECISION-MAKING AND CERTAINLY FOR COMMUNITY MEMBERS W. THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PROCESS NOW OR AFTER THE PUBLIC HEARING.
02:26:15.752: >> ALL RIGHT THANK YOU MR. LENART.  THIS IS -- NOW WE'LL OPEN THE PUBLIC HEARING. IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PERSONS TO SPEAK FOR UP TO THREE MINUTES ABOUT THE PROPOSED DISTRIBUTION OF THE ANN ARBOR MOVING TOGETHER TOWARDS VISION ZERO CITY OF ANN ARBOR COMPREHENSIVE TRANSPORTATION PLAN.  PUBLIC COMMENT MAY BE MADE BY CALLING 877.  AND THEN ENTERING MEETING ID 97519942176.  MR. LENART WILL CALL ON THOSE WHO DIGITALLY RAISED THEIR HAND BY PRESSING STAR NINE.  YOU'LL HEAR AN AUTOMATED ANNOUNCEMENT WHEN YOU'VE BEEN ALLOWED TO SPEAK. PLEASE MUTE.  PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS FOR THE RECORD.
02:27:13.977: >> NO CALLS YET.  WE'LL GIVE IT A FEW MOMENTS AS THERE IS SOMETIMES A DELAY.
02:27:20.283: >> GREAT.
02:27:30.594: >> I CAN SEE ALEX AGAIN AND NO CALLERS.
02:27:34.231: >> IF SOMEONE COMES IN WE MAY REOPEN THE PUBLIC HEARING ON THIS WHICH IS, AGAIN, ONE OF THE DIFFICULTIES OF DOING THIS ON ZOOM RATHER THAN IN CITY CHAMBERS BUT WE'RE WORKING ON IT.  THE MOTION READS THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION RECOMMENDS THAT THE MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL AUTHORIZE DISTRIBUTION OF THE ANN ARBOR MOVING TOGETHER TOWARD VISION ZERO COME PREHEN  -- COMPREHENSIVE TRANSPORTATION PLAN.  IN ACCORDANCE WITH MCL 125.3001.  AT C -- WHATEVER THAT MEANS.  THE MICHIGAN PLANNING ENABLING ACT WHICH IS PUBLIC ACT 33 OF 2008 AS AMENDED.  MOVED BY COMMISSIONER SAUVE.  SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER ABRAMS.  ANY DISCUSSION?
02:28:36.793: >> I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU.  AND THIS IS AWESOME.  I'M HAVE EXCITED TO SEE IT MOVE FORWARD. I WISH WE HAD A FULL MASTER PLAN TO TETHER TO THIS TOO BUT THIS IS A GOOD STEP TO START THOSE CONVERSATIONS.  SO I JUST REALLY WANT TO EXTEND MY EXCITEMENT AND APPRECIATION TO STAFF AND THE WHOLE TEAM FOR GETTING IT THIS FAR.  THIS IS GREAT.
02:29:00.951: >> COMMISSIONER.
02:29:02.219: >> I'M NOT SURE HOW APPROPRIATE IT IS TO RAISE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PLAN ITSELF BECAUSE WE'RE ONLY VOTING TO AUTHORIZE DISTRIBUTION WHICH OBVIOUSLY I THINK WE'RE GOING TO DO AND I CERTAINLY THINK WE SHOULD DO SO IF ANYONE CAN --
02:29:18.068: >> I WOULD SAY IT'S PERFECTLY APPROPRIATE.  THIS IS THE TIME FOR REVIEW AND COMMENT.  IF GIVEN THAT, I WOULD -- IF YOUR INTEREST IS TO START THAT REVIEW PROCESS, NONETHELESS, AS PART OF THAT YOU CAN RAISE QUESTIONS OR ITEMS THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SURE GET ADDRESSED.  THAT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE TETHERED TO THAT MOTION BUT ELI AND STACEY AND I CAN MAKE SURE THOSE COMMENTS ARE RECORDED AS PART OF THE OVERALL COMMENTS REFLECTED WHEN IT COMES BACK TO YOU IN ITS FINAL FORM.
02:29:50.534: >> OKAY SO THEN I WILL SAY TWO THINGS BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO HOLD US UP AND THIS ISN'T THE T TIME.  THIS DOCUMENT READS BEAUTIFULLY AND TEACHES YOU A LOT ABOUT ROAD DESIGN AND OTHER THINGS THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND IT'S EXCITING TO LOOK AT IT BECAUSE SOME OF THIS IS HAPPENING ON OUR STREETS ALREADY.  AND I LOVED THIS STRATEGY OF QUICK BUILD WHICH IS PROBABLY ABOUT AS CLOSE AS YOU CAN GET TO THOSE KWER RIL LA ACTIONS WHERE PEOPLE PUT IN A CROSSWALK WHERE THEY THINK YOU NEED ONE.  I FOUND THIS EXCITING BUT I WANTED TO RAISE ONE LITTLE QUESTION AND I JUST WANTED TO CALL ATTENTION ON ONE MAP -- A CONCERN I HAVE AS A REPRESENTATIVE.  AND MY QUESTION IS I'M SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT EIGHT OUT OF TEN ANN ARBOR IDENTITIES LIVE IN 28 NEIGHBORHOODS AND IT MIGHT BE BECAUSE OF THE DENSITY THAT MAKES THAT FIGURE WORK BECAUSE I THINK LIKE ALMOST ALL OF WARD ONE EXCEPT FOR THE SLICES THAT ARE DOWNTOWN ISN'T A 20 MINUTE NEIGHBORHOOD.  WE ARE FAR.  FROM GROSS SI STORES.  THAT STRUCK ME AS AN ODD NUMBER.  I MAY BE LOOKING AT MY PICTURE AND NOT REALIZING HOW MUCH DENSITY WE HAVE IN PLACES THAT PEOPLE CAN WALK INTO A GROCERY STORE. THAT'S PART OF THE PROBLEM WITH MY PART OF TOWN THAT WE REALLY DON'T HAVE AN EASY WAY OF SHOPPING.  LIKE EVEN IF I GO TO TOWN THAT'S A 50 MINUTE WALK, WELL, 40 MINUTE WALK.  AND MOST -- I DO MY SHOPPING THERE ACTUALLY BUT MOST PEOPLE DON'T DO THEIR GROCERY SHOPPING THERE BECAUSE THEY HAVE CHILDREN AND THEY WOULD GO BROKE.  SO BUT I'M ASSUMING THAT MY SENSE OF THAT FIGURE -- I'M ASSUMING THAT FIGURE IS RIGHT BUT CAN YOU REASSURE ME THAT IT REALLY IS AND YOU DIDN'T MAKE IT UP?
02:31:57.961: >> YEAH.  IN PART, I CAN HOPEFULLY REASSURE YOU BY SAYING IT SURPRISED ME TOO.  BUT THAT THAT IS WHAT THE DATA SHOWED AND I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT THE DATA IS, YOU KNOW, MAYBE SOMEWHAT SIMPLISTIC.  IT DOESN'T FACTOR IN PERSONAL CHOICE FOR ONE THING.  AND IT'S LOOKING AT AVAILABILITY OF GROCERY STORES OR RETAIL BUT MAYBE THOSE AREN'T THE PARTICULAR PLACES THAT YOU NEED TO GO SO IT MIGHT FEEL LIKE A 20 MINUTE NEIGHBORHOOD.
02:32:35.265: >> WELL WHEN DOES IT COUNT AS A GROCERY STORE.  YOU REALLY WOULD HAVE TO BE ABLE TO BUY THE THINGS THAT YOU NEED TO LIVE. NOT AT A GAS STATION.  YOU KNOW?
02:32:48.478: >> YEAH.
02:32:49.512: >> BUT --
02:32:50.413: >> WE HAD A FEW QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT.  SINCE THE LAST DRAFT AND SO WE DID INCLUDE SOME MAPS BREAKING DOWN ON PAGE 114 AND 115 TO BRET'S POINT THIS IS IS A LONG DOCUMENT.  AND WHERE YOU CAN REACH --
02:33:23.813: >> I'M NOT SEEING THAT ON 114 AND 115.
02:33:31.020: >> I CAN SHARE MY SCENE AGAIN.
02:33:32.489: >> OKAY.
02:33:33.556: >> YOU MIGHT BE LOOKING AT AN OLDER DRAFT.
02:33:36.025: >> YEAH.  OKAY.  OH, YEAH, SURE I AM.  I DON'T HAVE THAT.
02:33:48.405: >> YEAH WE DID HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR STRATEGY. WE BROKE DOWN THIS SERIES OF MAPS TO DEMONSTRATE.
02:33:55.178: >> YEAH, AND ACTUALLY WHAT I SAID IS TRUE, IF YOU LOOK AT THE PART THAT'S GRAY THERE A LOT OF THAT IS WARD ONE.
02:34:07.257: >> SO YOUR INTUITION IS RIGHT.
02:34:10.593: >> THANK YOU.  THOSE MAPS ARE HELPFUL.  I WILL MAKE SURE THAT I HAVE AN UATED DRAFT BECAUSE I DON'T.  AND THEN THE OTHER THING I WANT TO CALL YOUR ATTENTION TO, WELL, ONE THING IS THE GRAPHIC THAT YOU HAVE ABOUT MORE THAN ONE-THIRD OF ALL THE SPACE IN DOWNTOWN IS ALLOCATED FOR CARS IS DRAMATIC AND BEAUTIFUL.  THANK YOU.  THAT IS A VERY LONG ARGUMENT SUMMARIZED BY ONE SMALL PICTURE A THAT IS INCREDIBLY HELPFUL BUT O THE PAGE -- ON MY  PAGE 64 YOU HAVE THE PROPOSED BIKE ROUTES AND I'M THUMBING THROUGH MY THING NOW. I DON'T KNOW IF IT' YOUR PAGE 64.  BUT I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT TO YOU THAT IF YOU LOOK AT WHERE YOU STOP THE PURPLE BIKE THERE IS NO CONNECTION ON NORTH MAIN.  THERE NO WAY TO GET TO THAT BECAUSE WE'RE SEPARATED B I-14.  IFOUOOK - SO IT SHOOTSP SUMMIT AND GOES JUST, JUSTORTHF N-14 O NEWPO ROAD LEANG THISNTIRE NORTEST CORNER OF TITY WHH IS WARDNE THERE. THEY REALLY DON'T HAVE GOO BIK COECTIVITY INTO THE CITY MOREOV THEY HAVE LOST T ROUT 33 BUS AND SO TT LTLE NEIGHBHOOD IS WHAT I GOING TOALL NOW A TRANSITDERT. DRIVE BASILLY. ND SOME OF O THEM MIGHTANAGE T BIKE WITHT BIKE PATHSUT THEY DON'T HAVE A LOT OF OPTNS AND LITTLE -- YOCAN SEE .  LIKE, THWORLD END BEFORE -- I MEAN, BEFORE THE CITY.  THE ROUTES END BEFORE THE CITY ENDS AND IT IS A DOUBLE WHAMMY FOR THEM GIVEN THEY'VE LOST ROUTE 33.  I DON'T KNOW IF THAT BUS IS COMING BACK. I THINK IF THE ELIMINATION OF ROUTE 33 IS PERMANENT THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO DIAL A RIDE ANYMORE. IT HAS TO BE ABLE TO BRING YOU CLOSE ENOUGH TO AN EXISTING BUS ROUTE. WITH ROUTE 33 GONE THAT WON'T BE TRUE FOR DIAL A RIDE AND THEY'RE AFRAID THEIR GOING TO LOSE IT. I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THAT CORNER OF THE CITY AND ABOUT NORTH MAIN WHICH I KNOW THAT MAY A SEPARATE PROJECT AND FAILING TO DO SOMETHING CREATE AND I H HAVE -- CREATIVE AND WONDERFUL WITH NORTH MAIN MAY LEAVE SOME CREATIVE GAPS.
02:37:30.560: >> YEAH, I CAN SPEAK TO THIS AREA A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE I THINK THAT WE WERE ORIGINALLY GOING FOR A -- ALL AGES AND ABILITIES NETWORK BECAUSE THERE'S STILL SOMETHING WE'RE GOING FOR BUT WE HAVE -- HAD SINCE ALSO ADDED BACK IN PROPOSED ROUTES THAT WE SIMPLY THINK SHOULD STILL BE A PART OF THE BIKE NETWORK BUT MAYBE CAN'T REACH THAT LEVEL OF TRULY LOW STRESS BIKE ROUTES.
02:38:37.493: >> WHERE THE PURPLE LINE ENDS WE HAVE A WONDERFUL NEW INFRASTRUCTURE.  WE HAVE THE TU TUNNEL.FOLKS CAN ACCESS THE BOARD TO BORDER TRAIL WHICH IS NOT A LONG AND ON NORTH MAIN STREET BUT DOES PARALLEL NORTH MAIN STREET IN THAT IT BEGINS TO SHOW THE WAY THAT THAT CORRIDOR MAY BE SERVED MOVING FORWARD NOW TOMORROW NIGHT THE CITY PARK AND WASHINGTON COUNTY PARKS IS HAVING A PUBLIC MEETING FOR THE BARTEN TO BAN DER MERE PROJECT THAT HAS BEEN PART OF OUR NONMOTORIZED PLAN AND PLANNING SINCE 2007.
02:39:31.380: >> FORWARD LOOKING THE STANDPOINT OF GETTING FROM THE SU SUMMIT/NORTH MAIN INTERSECTION ALTHOUGH I AGREE IT IS AN UNSAFE MOVE THAT OUR INVESTMENTS OVER TIME AND ANTICIPATED FUTURE INVESTMENTS WILL CREATE AN ALL AGES AND ALL USERS NETWORK CONNECTION USING THE BORDER TO BORDER TRAIL AND IN CONNECTING UNDER THE RAILROAD AT THE NORTH END OF THE CORRIDOR BY THE RIVER.  SO THAT'S PERHAPS A LITTLE MORE DETAIL THAN YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO SEE ON THIS MAP.  THE ONLY OTHER PIECE THAT I WILL ADD AS TO PROCESS, IS THAT MDOT IS CONTEMPLATING A PROJECT ON NORTH MAIN STREET. AT THIS POINT THEY MOVED IT OUT TO THEIR FY 2026 AND THERE WILL BE A ROBUST PUBLIC PROCESS TO HELP US IDENTIFY A MULTIMODAL TRANSPORTATION STRATEGY FOR THAT CORRIDOR.  YOU MAY BE AWARE THERE'S AN EXISTING CITY PROJECT CALLED THE NORTH MAIN VISION I BELIEVE THAT'S STILL RESIDENT ON THE WEBSITE AND THE INTENT TO COORDINATE OUR PLANNING WITH MDOT AND TO ACHIEVE THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF PENETRATION FOR AN ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION COMPONENT ALONG THE NORTH MAIN CORRIDOR. SO I HOPE THAT'S HELPFUL.  I'D BE HAPPY TO SPEAK WITH YOU OFFLINE --
02:41:07.844: >> YEAH.  WE SHOULD SPEAK OFFLINE.  THERE'S JUST ONE THING I WOULD ADD IS THAT, YES, I KNOW THAT THE B 2 B TRAIL PARALLELS NORTH MAIN THERE AND YOU ACTUALLY USED TO BE ABLE TO LEGALLY CROSS BY CROSSING OVER THE RAILROAD TRACKS BUT NOW THERE'S A BIG FENCE.
02:41:25.494: >> YEAH.  UNFORTUNATELY --
02:41:27.096: >> -- CAN'T GET TO MAIN STREET ANYMORE.
02:41:29.832: >> UNFORTUNATELY, IT WAS NEVER LEGAL.  IT WAS MORE PERMITTED THAN WHEN THE STATE TOOK POSSESSION OF THAT CORRIDOR ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE YEARS AGO NOW SO THERE WAS A MAJOR CHANGE IN OWNERSHIP AND IT'S NOW AN MDOT OWNED RAILROAD AND IT'S A PUBLIC AGENCY AND ONE OF ELEVEN DESIGNATED HIGH SPEED RAILROAD CORRIDORS IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. THEY'RE DOING THEIR BEST TO PROTECT THAT RIGHT OF WAY.
02:41:55.691: >> YEP.  NO, I UNDERSTAND THAT, IT'S THE FACT THAT IT PARALLELS NORTH MAIN STREET.  THAT'S FINE BUT YOU CAN'T GET THERE.  SO THERE'S REALLY, YOU KNOW, THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE -- ONLY THE THING THAT YOU CAN DO TO GET ALONG THAT PART OF -- IF YOU REALLY WANT TO BE NEAR THE DRIVE IS TO RIDE ON THE SIDEWALK OF -- ALONG NORTH MAIN STREET.  SO ANYWAY, BUT, YEAH, WE CAN TALK MORE AND I'M HAPPY -- I'LL BE AT THAT MEETING TOMORROW NIGHT I'M REALLY EXCITED THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE MAN DA MORE TUNNEL BECAUSE THAT WOULD EASE THIS A LOT.
02:42:42.471: >> WE LOST SARA.
02:42:44.407: >> WE LOST THE CHAIR.  OH, THERE SHE IS.
02:42:54.417: >> SORRY.  I DON'T KNOW WHAT WENT ON BUT I'M BACK.
02:42:56.686: >> CAN I ASK A QUESTION?
02:42:59.121: >> GO FOR IT.
02:42:59.989: >> I'M LIKE THERE'S NOBODY TO CALL ON ME.  I DON'T KNOW.  I JUST HAD A QUESTION, I WANTED TO SECOND THE COMMENTS ABOUT THE ACCESSIBILITY AND THE COMPREHENSIVE NATURE AND THE EXCITEMENT ABOUT THIS PLAN.  I SECOND ALL OF THOSE.  I HAD A QUESTION MORE ABOUT PROCESS BECAUSE THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'M DOING THE KIND OF MASTER PLAN PROCESS AS A COMMISSIONER. SO IF WE VOTE TO APPROVE THIS -- OR VOTE TO RECOMMEND THAT THIS GET DISTRIBUTED AND THEN THERE'S A PERIOD FOR PUBLIC COMMENT AND THEN IT COMES BACK TO US, IS THERE A -- WHAT IS THE MEANS BY WHEN WHICH WE KNOW WHAT THE PUBLIC COMMENT YIELDED IF ANY -- LIKE DO WE RECEIVE THAT PUBLIC COMMENT OR DO YOU FILTER IT AND REPORT TO US?  HOW DOES THAT WORK?  YOU'RE MUTED.
02:43:52.008: >> YOU'RE MUTED BRET.
02:43:55.911: >> NOT MY BEST MEETING.  DURING THAT COMMENT PERIOD WE WILL ACTUALLY BE AGGREGATING THOSE COMMENTS AND DISCUSSING WHAT WAS HEARD DURING THAT TIME PERIOD. IT MAY RESULT TO CHANGES AND ADJUSTMENTS OR OTHER THINGS THAT WE ACKNOWLEDGE BUT DON'T RESOLVE OR HAVE ANY ADJUSTMENT TO THE PLAN BUT WE WILL BRING ALL OF THOSE COMMENT TO YOU AND SUMMARIZE WHAT WE HEARD FROM WHAT THE ENTITIES, THE PARTNERS, THE PUBLIC AND ULTIMATELY BRING YOU A DRAFT VERSION THAT WE BELIEVE IS REFLECTIVE OF THE ASPECTS THAT WE THINK SHOULD OR SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED AND AT THAT POINT THAT WILL BE WHERE YOU MAKE THE DETERMINATION THAT YES, THIS IS THE FINAL VERSION OF THE DOCUMENT THAT WE WANT TO GUIDE THE LAND USE POLICY.
02:44:43.793: >> AND YOU SAID THAT IS TWO MONTHS?
02:44:46.328: >> YES.
02:44:46.629: >> YOU WOULD EXPECT US TO COME BACK EARLY 2021.
02:44:52.368: >> PROCESS-WISE, THIS WILL PROBABLY APPEAR ON THE CITY COUNCIL AGENDA IN EARLY JANUARY. THEN THERE'LL BE SOME DISTRIBUTION AFTER THAT.  SO PROBABLY MARCH I WOULD GUESS IS THE TIMEFRAME.
02:45:08.017: >> OKAY.  THANK YOU.  THAT'S ALL FOR ME.
02:45:12.488: >> COMMISSIONER?
02:45:13.055: >> WHAT IS THE PROCESS FOR A STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AND DISTRIBUTION OF THIS?
02:45:22.832: >> WELL THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF PARTICULAR ENGAGEMENT WITH THE PLAN BUT THE ACT ITSELF IS WE SEND IT TO ADJACENT JURISDICTIONS, TO THE COUNTY, AND SEND IT TO SEMCOG.  WE HAVE TO SEND IT TO THE MICHIGAN PARTMEF TRANSPORTATION AND THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE STAKEHOLDERS TO SEE THAT.  IT IS ALSO A GENERALLY OPEN PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD AS WELL FOR ANY ADDITIONAL FEEDBACK TO THE PROVIDED ON THE PLAN.
02:45:58.000: >> I GUESS THAT WAS REALLY WHEN I SAID STAKEHOLDERS I MEANT RESIDENT ENGAGEMENT.  LIKE HOW -- I KNOW WE'VE HAD TROUBLE WITH BEING NOTICED ABOUT THINGS. LIKE OUR MEETINGS.  HOW DO PEOPLE KNOW THIS IS AVAILABLE FOR THEM TO COMMENT ON?  I PREFACE -- I -- YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN DOING LIKE MY OWN SOUL SEARCHING WHEN IT COME TO RACIAL JUSTICE AND SOCIAL EQUITY.  I WANT TO MAKE SURE ALL THEOICES IN OUR COMMUNITY.  I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE ARE 70% WHITE BUT WE NEED TO HEAR FROM THESE VOICES THAT WE DON'T TYPICALLY HEAR FROM AND THAT MAY REQUIRE OUTREACH THAT WE DON'T TYPICALLY DO.  I WONDER IF THERE'S A PLAN BEYOND LIKE POSTING IT ON NEXT DOOR OR WHATEVER THE TRADITIONAL THINGS ARE THIS IS A REALLY BIG IMPORTANT PLAN THAT IMPACTS EVERYONE THAT LIVES HERE OR THAT WANT TO LIVE HERE.
02:46:53.689: >> I THINK THOSE ARE GREAT QUESTIONS.  I WILL START AND STACEY AND ELI IF YOU WANT T JUMP IN AT ALL ONE OF THE ASPECTS OF THAT BUT EQUITY IS A BIG COMPONENT OF THIS TRANSPORTATION PLAN AS WELL. AND SO I AM PROUD TO BEART OF REFLECT THAT.  BUT, APART FROM THAT, THIS, ELI AND PARTICULARLY SOME OF THE PARTNERS THAT HE WORKS WIT DIRECTLY ANDIS TEAM AND THE PUBLIC SERVICES DIVISION ARE ACTUALLY THE CREATORAND SORT O GURUS OF SOMETHING CALLED THEITY'S PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT TOOLK WHICH ACTULY HAS A LOT OF RESOURCES THAT HELPS TOUIDE US TO MAKE SURE THAT WE AEACHING OUT TO THOSE POLATIONS AND COMMUNITIES AT MAYBE WE D'T HEROM TYPICALLY.  SO I WLD SUSPECT THATT HAPPENEMORE SUCCESSFULLYN THIS PJECT BECAE OF THE IEGRATION OF THE RK OTHIS TEAM. TT TOOLS AVAILLE TO EVERYONE ON THE TM BUTUST THE SHEER NUMBER OF PROJESEING DONE ON TRANSPORTAON AND CATAL, THEY ARESING THAT TOOL MOS OFTEN. GUESS I WILL SP THE ELI AT THERE'S MORE OPPORTUTY IN AT REGARD.
02:48:17.773: >> I AMOING TO JUMP IN AND SAY THAT THERE ALWAYS ROO FOR IMOVEMENT AND TT OUR FROM THE T-GO.  WE D TE ATT LET O PROACTE STEP AND WE HOSTED A PUBLIC OPEN HOUSE AT THE PIECE NEIGHBORHOOD COMMUNITY CENTER AND SO THAT IS -- ONE SPECIFIC AND DIRECT ASPECT THAT WE'VE ADDED TO OUR COMMUNITY OUTREACH.  BEYOND THAT, WE DID GO THROUGH AN EXERCISE OF IDENTIFYING STAKEHOLDERS.  AND THEN CREATING CONTACT LISTS WHERE IT'S THROUGH OUR COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE THAT MOST OF THE COMMUNICATIONS THAT WE DO AS A CITY NOW ARE BROADCAST, E-MAIL OR WE DO HAVE THROUGH THE COMMUNICATIONS DEPARTMENT, THE ABILITY TO DO SOCIAL MEDIA BLAST AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT TOOLKIT THAT MEMBERS OF A VARIETY OF NEIGHBORHOODS HAVE IDENTIFIED THEMSELVES.  WE HAVE ADDED THOSE TO OUR STAKEHOLDERS LISTS AND HAVE BEEN RECEIVING THE MAILOUTS.  I'M REALLY PROUD TO SAY AND I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE DIVERSITY OF THE ENGAGEMENT BUT I KNOW THAT THROUGH THE SAM SCHWARTZ TEAM, STACEY AND HER COLLEAGUES HAVE CONSTRUCTED SEVERAL ONLINE ENGAGEMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND WE LITERALLY TOUCHED THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE THAT WE HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE IN OUR TRANSPORTATION PLANNING PROCESSES.  SO TO THE EXTENT THAT I CAN'T GIVE YOU THE SPECIFIC COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE ENGAGED WITH US.  I CAN ASSURE SURE THAT I HAVE USED OUR BEST ABILITY TO REACH OUT AND I KNOW KNOW OUR COMMUNICATIONS AND PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT STAFF HAVE BEEN ATTENDING OUR MEETINGS AND WE HAVE THE QUESTIONNAIRES FOR PEOPLE TO FILL OUT. AS TO IDENTIFICATION OF THE PERSONALITY -- PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS AND SO THERE IS SOME REPORTING OF THAT BUT AS I SAID AT THE ONSET OF THIS RESPONSE WE REALLY NEED TO CONTINUE TO WORK HARDER TO DO A BETTER JOB OF REACHING OUT TO THE FULL ARRAY OF OUR COMMUNITY.
02:51:10.512: >> TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT, THERE IS A NETWORK OF FOLKS THAT EXPRESSED INTEREST TO FOLLOWING THIS PROCESS.  WE HAVE OUR NORMAL METHODS OF DISTRIBUTIONS THROUGH OUR DELIVERY SERVICE. WE CAN DO SOCIAL MEDIA AND THE LIKE.  I WOULD JUST SAY THAT OFTENTIMES WHEN WE -- MY EXPERIENCE IS WHEN WE TAKE ON THOSE BROAD NOTIFICATIONS, WE GET VERY SIMILAR PATTERNS OF RESPONSE.  SO IT'S -- IT CAN BE CHALLENGING PROBABLY BECAUSE THE WAY TO DO THAT IS A MUCH MORE NARROW DISTRIBUTION WHICH ISN'T ALWAYS THE BEST APPROACH EITHER BECAUSE IT IS INTEND TO BE COMMUNITY WIDE.  THAT IS SOMETHING WE CAN CERTAINLY REPORT OUT ABOUT ABOUT HOW WE MADE THAT NOTIFICATION AWARE, WHO IT WAS SHARED WITH AND WE CAN INCLUDE THAT WITH THE ACTUAL FEEDBACK.
02:52:02.064: >> OKAY.
02:52:02.898: >> YEAH, I THINK -- TO ME, AND, AGAIN, I'M NOT AN EXPERT.  I'M LEARNING ABOUT THIS TOO, I APPRECIATE THAT WE'RE DOING MORE AND I APPRECIATE THAT YOU REALIZE WE CAN DO BETTER.  I THINK AN APPROACH WHERE IT IS THE BROAD COMMUNITY-WIDE APPROACH.  IT IS TARGETED AND IN MY OPINION WE SHOULD BE TRYING TO OVERSAMPLE SOME OF THE POPULATIONS AND I'M THINKING BLACK RESIDENTS WHO WE DON'T NECESSARILY HEAR FROM OR CHURCHES OR SOMETHING WE COULD GO OUT TO.  I APPRECIATE THAT EQUITY IS VERY STRONG THROUGHOUT THIS PLAN BUT, YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE THAT PERSPECTIVE FROM, LIKE, BLACK RESIDENTS AND OTHER RESIDENTS OF COLOR BECAUSE THEY HAVE JUST DIFFERENT LIVED EXPERIENCES THAN LIKE, NO OFFENSE TO ANY OF US AT THE TABLE HERE BUT WHITE PLANNING COMMISSIONERS AND WHITE CONSULTANTS AND WHITE CITY STAFF.  SO EVEN LIKE HAVING SOME DIFFERENT EYES ON THIS TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS SAYING THE RIGHT THINGS AND LIKE COMMUNICATING WHAT WE WANT TO DO.  I THINK WE ALL HAVE THIS COMMENT.  -- INTENT.  BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO TRY TO TRIANGULATE IT AND THERE'S ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT.  KIND OF ALONG THOSE SAME LINES.  OUT OF THE 22 STRATEGIES OR WHATEVER YOU CALL THEM I NOTICED THAT ENGAGEMENT IS NUMBER 20 BUT IT SENDS A MESSAGE TO ME THAT COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT WHICH I THINK NEEDS TO HAPPEN IS SO FAR DOWN THAT LIST.  I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WAS INTENTIONAL OR NOT.  IF THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO RAISE THAT UP THAT MIGHT SEND MORE OF A MESSAGE THAT WE'RE SERIOUS ABOUT THIS AND ABOUT ENGAGING AS MANY PEOPLE AS WE CAN BECAUSE THIS PLAN IS LIKE TOUCHING STREETS EVERYWHERE IN THE CITY.
02:54:04.319: >> I DON'T KNOW, ELI, IF YOU WANT TO COMMENT ON THAT.  I SAW IT AS BEING IMPORTANT AND THAT IS WHY IT IS ONE OF THOSE 22. AND THAT IS -- THEY ARE NOT IN ORDER OF PRIORITY.  AND IT'S JUST TO SAY THAT THAT IS A KEY STRATEGY AND IT SHOULDN'T BE LOOKED AT SOMETHING THAT IS NOT IMPORTANT.  I THINK THAT THE CITY DOES PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT IN ALL OF ITS PROJECTS.  AND RIGHT NOW, YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE SAYING, YOU SHOULD DO PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT WHERE YOU'RE NOT ALREADY.  SO IT'S A MATTER OF ADJUSTING THE WAY THAT ENGAGEMENT IS DONE.  AND SO I GUESS THERE WAS NO SPECIFIC THOUGHT INTO IT BEING NUMBER TWENTY AND NOT NUMBER FIVE.
02:54:54.870: >> WELL MAYBE IT CAN BE REORDERED.  I MEAN, LIKE, WE JUST DON'T KNOW HOW PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE.  PEOPLE COULD VIEW THEM AS A PRIORITY EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE NOT INTENDED TO BE A PRIORITY.  IF THERE IS A POSSIBILITY TO TRY TO MOVE IT UP AND MAKE IT REALLY CLEAR THAT LIKE, THIS IS -- IT'S ONE OF 22 WHICH MAKES IT IMPORTANT BUT IT'S NUMBER TWO OF 22.  IT'S THE MESSAGING OF IT I THINK.
02:55:26.268: >> I WOULD -- WANTED TO ADD TOO TO WHAT ELI WAS SAYING ABOUT ENGAGEMENT THAT THE COMMUNITY ADVISORY GROUP THAT WE CONVENED WAS, I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS THE RIGHT TERM TO USE BUT KIND OF A QUASI PUBLIC MEETING EVERY TIME. I MEAN, IT WAS OPEN TO THE PUBLIC.  WE DID HAVE PUBLIC MEMBERS ATTEND THOSE MEETINGS AND IT WAS A PRETTY BROAD GROUP IN TERMS OF TH MEMBERSHIP AS WELL.  THE CORE MEMBERSHIP SO WE DID GET PRETTY BROAD REPRESENTATION THROUGH THAT IN ADDITION TO THE OUTREACH THAT ELI TALKED ABOUT.
02:56:02.404: >> I WAS GOING TO ASK ABOUT THAT ADVISORY COMMITTEE AND IF YOU HAD A SENSE OF LIKE THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE PEOPLE THAT PARTICIPATED OR IF IT WASN'T NECESSARILY A SET GROUP.
02:56:14.683: >> WE HAVE THE LIST OF GROUPS AND PEOPLE WHO WERE INVOLVED. WE COULD SEND YOU --
02:56:20.188: >> OKAY.  I DON'T MEAN -- I FEEL LIKE I'M ALMOST HARPING ON THIS. I JUST THINK THESE ARE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE DON'T HAVE.  THEY'RE NOT COMFORTABLE TO HAVE BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE THEM.  I HAVE A COUPLE REALLY MINOR THINGS.  I KNOW -- NOT REALLY MINOR.  ON PAGE 56 WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE SIDEWALKS AND THE FUNDING SOURCES I THINK IT WAS WRITTEN BEFORE THE ELECTION AND WE PASSED THAT PREPOSITION SO I WONDER IF THAT SHOULD BE UPDATED.  SIMILARLY ON PAGE 27 THERE'S A BOX ABOUT HEALTHY STREETS BUT DIDN'T HEALTHY STREETS END IN -- I DON'T KNOW IF THERE WOULD BE ANY DATA FROM THAT?  I KNOW WE SAID SOMETHING ABOUT COLLECTING DATA BUT MAYBE THERE'S ACTUALLY DATA THAT COULD BE INCLUDED IN THAT BOX SINCE THE PROGRAM IS BASICALLY OVER I THINK.
02:57:09.571: >> THE SIDEWALK ONE HAS ALREADY BEEN UPDATED AND SO THIS VERSION DOES REFLECT THE --
02:57:15.210: >> OH, OKAY.  AWESOME.  I THINK I'M LOOKING AT AN OLD VERSION TOO.
02:57:20.148: >> WITH REGARD TO THE HEALTHY STREETS, THERE -- EARLIER THIS AFTERNOON I WAS ENGAGED IN A CONVERSATION WITH OUR STAFF AND THE DDH STAFF.  THERE IS A REPORT -- A TECHNICAL REPORT BEING PREPARED FOR COUNCIL IS THAT AND THAT WILL GIVE US THE BACKGROUND INFORMATION TO ADD A LITTLE MORE FLESH ON THE BONES IN THAT SECTION.
02:57:45.507: >> GREAT.  JUST ONE THING ON THE -- I LIKED THE SECTION ABOUT, LIKE, THE MOTION -- THE RED SHARING -- LIKE THE SCOOTERS AND BIKE SHARING AND ALL OF THAT.  THIS DOESN'T NEED TO BE ADDED TO THE PLAN NECESSARILY, I WAS THINKING THERE WAS A LOT OF LIKE, DISCUSSION OF EQUITY IN THOSE SECTIONS THAT I WONDER IF WE SHOULD LOOK INTO OPTIONS FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE CREDIT CARDS.  AND I DON'T KNOW, I THINK THERE ARE BIKE SHARE SYSTEMS THAT YOU CAN PAY CASH FOR CARDS.  BUT JUST SOMETHING TO KEEP IN MIND AS WE THINK OF EQUITY.  IF THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO CREDIT CARDS AND CREDIT CARDS ARE WHAT YOU NEED TO GET THE APPS OR WHATEVER.  MAYBE THERE ARE ALTERNATIVES THAT OTHER CITIES HAVE BEEN DOING TO ALLOW PEOPLE WITHOUT CREDIT CARDS TO ACCESS THOSE MODES.  I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE BIKE SHARE IN THE CITY. IT'S VERY EXCITING.  AND ONE MORE THING AND THEN I'LL STOP TALKING.  THE NAME, MOVING TOGETHER TOWARD VISION ZERO WHICH IS GREAT BUT THEN WHEN I READ IT THERE'S LIKE THESE TWO MAIN CRITICAL GOALS OF VISION ZERO AND CARBON NEUTRALITY AND EQUAL GOALS.  I'M WONDERING WHY THE NAME JUST SAYS MOVING TOWARD VISION ZERO AND NOT CARBON NEUTRALITY.  IF IT IS AS IMPORTANT.  I'M SORRY.
02:59:08.523: >> I APPRECIATE THE OBSERVATION AND WHEN WE BEGAN TO SCOPE OUT THIS TRANSPORTATION PLAN UPDATE THE VISION ZERO SAFETY EM -- EMPHASIS WAS PARAMNT AS WE WERE RECRUITING SAM SCHWARTZ AND GETTING A PROCESS STARTED, THE CITY FOUND A RENEWED INTEREST IN ADOPTI AN A-0 THE WHO CARBON NERALITY.  I'M NOT GOING TO VALUE ONE AS HHER THAN THE HER BUT I THINK THE IMPTANCE OFCOMINGLING THE CONCES THAT CARE ABOUT HUN HEALTH AND SAFETY A WE CE ABOUT VIRONMENTAL ALTH AND SAFETY AND THEA-0TANDS O ITS OWN WITH ITSRAMEWORK BUT IN THE SAMEAY THAT ET'S TALKING ABOUT OTRSPECTS O THE MASTER PLA DEALING WITH LAND USE.  TH TRANSPORTATN IS ONE OF THE IMPORTANT ELENTS OF T IT IN ORDETO HAVE THATROSSE ERAND CORRETION BETWEEN VISI ZERO AND HUMAN HEAH A ABOUT HUMAHEALTH AND SAFY AS WE.  BUT IT'S AO MORE ABOUT IS THEIRST I'M HEARING A HIS QUTION OFHY THE COBRANDI BUT IT'S RLLY THERIMARY TOWARDS THE SION ZERO BUT WE CLEARLY ACKNOWLEDGE RESPECT AND REFLECT THE TRANSPORTATION ROLE IN ACHIEVING CARBON NEUTRALITY.
03:01:01.636: >> HERE'S A WAY TO EVEN SAY THAT, MAYBE I'M THE ONLY PERSON THAT'S GOING TO BE CONFUSED BY THIS.  I THINK THE TITLE'S GREAT.  LET ME JUST SAY THAT. THE ONLY REASON I'M SAYING -- I'M SAYING SOME NIT PICKY STUFF. YOU GUYS CAN AN AMAZING JOB WITH THIS.  IT'S SO EASY TO READ. IT'S SO WELL LAID OUT.  IT LOOKS BEAUTIFUL.  SO, IT'S AWESOME. MAYBE THERE'S A WAY TO REWORD THAT INTRO TO SAY, ELI, EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAID.  THESE PLANS, THIS IS FOCUSED ON THAT.  JUST SO, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE -- MAYBE NOBODY ELSE WOULD THIS THIS.  I READ THIS AS TWO KEY THINGS AND I THOUGHT WAIT A MINUTE, ISN'T IT MOVING TOWARD VISION ZERO? I'M GOING TO STOP TALKING.
03:01:53.188: >> THANK YOU FOR THAT FEEDBACK. AND I WILL GET TOGETHER WITH STACEY AND HER TEAM AND WE'LL FIGURE OUT IF THERE'S A WAY TO FRAME IT SO THAT IT FLOWS MORE SMOOTHLY TOGETHER.
03:02:04.566: >> I THINK IF WE COULD MAKE IT LONGER, THAT'D BE GREAT.
03:02:09.337: >> YEAH.
03:02:10.338: >> THE TITLE TOO.  I MEAN, IT COULD BE LONGER.
03:02:13.441: >> TRY NOT TO MAKE IT LONGER. IT'S A GOOD SNAPPY TITLE.
03:02:22.450: >> ANYBODY ELSE?  COMMISSIONER?
03:02:35.597: >> I APPRECIATE EVERYTHING, COMMISSIONER.  WHEN THE A-0 PLAN WAS DEBATED, PEOPLE CLAIMED THAT THE LAND USE ELEMENTS OF THAT PLAN WERE A SNEAKY AGENDA TO MAKE EVERYTHING ABOUT LAND USE AND SO I ACTUALLY THINK THAT WE WANT TO BE -- I APPRECIATE THE SUBTLETY WITH WHICH THIS PLAN INJECTED SOME LAND USE STUFF AND DID IT QUIETLY BECAUSE I THINK THAT THAT IS LIKELY TO BECOME CONTROVERSIAL AND I THINK THERE IS BROADER AGREEMENT AROUND VISION ZERO AND WHEN THEY THINK ABOUT TRANSPORTATION THEY THINK ABOUT VISION ZERO AND NOT EVERYONE WANT TO MAKE THE CONNECTION THAT WE'RE MAKING HERE AND THAT THE PLAN ACTUALLY MAKES BETWEEN TRANSPORTATION AND LAND USE AND I THINK WE WANT TO BE CAREFUL THERE.  I THINK WE WANT TO SUCCEED WITH THAT CONNECTION AND SO I'M NOT SURE THAT WE WANT TO FLAG IT TOO MUCH HONESTLY, BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE GOING TO GET FROM THE USUAL SUSPECTS, THE KIND OF PUSHBACK THAT A-0 SAW AND IF WE CAN BE SNEAKY IT'S -- WELL I SHOULDN'T SAY THAT.  THIS IS BEING WATCHED BY PEOPLE.  BUT, YOU KNOW, IF WE CAN BE, YEAH, LET ME -- WELL ANYWAY, THE DAMAGE IS DONE. IT'S ONLY TEN O'CLOCK. EVERYONE'S TOTALLY AWAKE AND -- WATCHING.  IF WE JUST -- IF WE CAN JUST BE CAREFUL ABOUT NOT MAKING EVERYTHING SOUND LIKE IT'S ALL ABOUT PUTTING SIX STORY BUILDINGS IN EVERYONE'S NEIGHBORHOOD IN ANN ARBOR, IT WILL GO OVER BETTER.  BUT I DO AGREE THAT IT IS CONFUSING TO ME THAT WE HAVE A VISION ZERO PLAN AND AN A-0 PLAN.  I THINK WE GOT TOO MANY ZEROS NOW BUT I THINK WE'RE STUCK WITH IT.
03:04:36.451: >> THAT ACTUALLY WAS ONE OF THE COMMENTS THAT I WAS GOING TO MAKE WHICH KIND OF IS ALSO TALKING ABOUT THE ROLE OF COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT THAT THE COMMISSIONER WAS TALKING ABOUT.  I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MAY BE CONTROVERSIAL THAT HAS BEEN ON OUR WORK LIST FOR SOME TIME IS TALKING ABOUT PARKING.  IT'S NO SECRET NOW, LIKE YOU DIDN'T SPILL THE BEANS, COMMISSIONER, ON THAT, WE TALKED ABOUT IT WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT OUR WORK PLAN BEFORE.  THERE HAS BEEN ROBUST ENGAGEMENT OVER THIS PLAN AND IF THERE CAN BE ADDITIONAL ROBUST ENGAGEMENT IN THE NEXT, YOU KNOW, COUPLE OF MONTHS BEFORE IT IS BROUGHT BEFORE US FOR A PUBLIC HEARING FOR ADOPTION, AND THAT WHAT IS IN THIS PLAN, CALLS FOR SAME THING THAT SO MANY OF OUR PREVIOUS PLANS HAVE CALLED FOR BUT IT'S MUCH MORE RECENT, RIGHT?  I THINK THAT THAT ACTUALLY, RIGHT NOW, WHAT'S DRAFTED IN THERE IS THAT BY 2022.  NOT IN 2022.  BY 2022. WOULD REMOVE PARKING MINIMUM CITYWIDE AND ESTABLISH PARKING MAXIMUMS DOWNTOWN.  I DON'T WANT TO SNEAK THAT IN THERE.  I DON'T WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE KNOW THAT.  BECAUSE I KNOW WANT TO GET THAT STUFF OUT NOW SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY ONCE WE ADOPT THIS PLAN VERY QUICKLY MOVE TO IMPLEMENT IT AND SO TO SOME EXTENT RATHER THAN HAVING ANOTHER PROCESS THAT COMES THAT INCLUDES MORE PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT IF THERE IS A LOT OF PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT HERE AND WE'RE ABLE TO DO THOSE THINGS CLOSE TOGETHERCHY -- TOGETHER WHICH I APPRECIATE MR. LENART GIVING US ROOM TO GROW.  THAT WE JUST HAD A PLAN AND A ROBUST PLANNING PROCESS AND ENSURE THAT WE MAKE SURE IT IS INCLUSIVE AND IS HEARING LOTS OF VOICES BECAUSE IT'S BETTER TO HEAR IT NOW THAN WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT IT.  IN MY PERSONAL OPINION.  I DON'T WANT TO SINK YOUR PLAN BUT I THINK THERE'S LOTS IN HERE AND I THINK THE BENEFIT OF THIS PLAN IS TO SHOW HOW THEY ALL WORK TOGETHER AND IT'S NOT AN EASY THING.  THERE ARE BENEFITS OF GETTING PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR CARS.  RIGHT? THAT'S JUST SO THAT -- SOMEBODY'S CAR -- THERE'S JUST BENEFITS IN ALL OF THAT.  SO, COMMISSION -- NOT COMMISSIONER, MR. LENART.
03:07:09.804: >> WELL, I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR THE PURPOSE OF THIS IS TO, YOU KNOW, THE -- THE PLAN IS DEVELOPED.  THE GOALS ARE DEVELOPED.  SO THIS STAGE IS REALLY ABOUT -- THIS IS WHAT WE INTEND TO ADOPT.  THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT THERE AREN'T OPPORTUNITIES FOR TWEAKS AND ADJUSTMENTS BUT -- AND I DON'T SAY THAT BECAUSE I THINK WHAT I'M HEARING ARE THINGS THAT ARE OUT OF BASE BUT THE -- TO A LARGE EXTENT, THE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT HAS OCCURRED ON WHY THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT ARE IN THE DOCUMENT.  WHY THESE ARE THE 22 STRATEGIES NOT IN ORDER, THAT ARE MOST RES NANT -- RESONANT WITH OUR COMMUNITIES.  THESE ARE THE THINGS BY WHICH YOU SHOULD MEASURE WHAT IS IN THE PLAN. I WANT TO BE CLEAR WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THIS PERIOD OF TIME, IT I THINGS BY WHICH YOU SHOULD MEASURE WHAT IS IN THE PLAN. I WANT TO BE CLEAR WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THIS PERIOD OF TIME, IT IS WE WILL LISTEN TO EVERYTHING OF COURSE BUT AT THIS TIME WE HAVE HEARD FROM THE COMMUNITY THROUGH ENGAGEMENT AND THIS IS OUR REFLECTION BACK TO THEM.  AND SO THE -- WHETHER YOU ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT BEING DAY LIT OR NOT, THAT, YOU KNOW, I DON'T WANT TO SAY IT DOESN'T MATTER.  IT DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE VALUES THAT CAME OUT OF OUR COMMUNITY CONVERSATIONS. THOSE -- THAT'S WHY THEY'RE HERE.  IT'S NOT, YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHY THESE ARE THE THINGS IN THAT PLAN THAT WE ARE NOW PRESENTING TO SAY, THIS IS WHAT WE HEARD.  AND THIS IS WHAT WE SHOULD GET TO WORK ON.  SO I JUST WANT TO SORT OF SET THAT STAGE.  IT'S NOT TO SAY THAT THERE'S THAT -- WE CAN'T BE MORE SUCCESSFUL ALWAYS IN ENGAGEMENT. AND WE CAN SHARE THAT OPPORTUNITY FOR THAT SAME WIDE ENGAGEMENT TO SAY, THAT'S WHERE WE ARE AND MAKE SURE EVERYBODY'S AFFORDED THAT OPPORTUNITY AND WE CAN TRY TO OVER AFFORD.  BE MORE TARGETED TO PROVIDE THAT OPPORTUNITY WHAT WE THINK IS BEST.  BUT I WANT TO SET THE STAGE THAT WHETHER WE DESIRE TO BE OUT IN FRONT OR TO NOT BE OUT IN FRONT IS SOMEWHAT IRRELEVANT NOW.  THE TASK BEFORE YOU IN A COUPLE OF MONTHS AND AT THIS PRELIMINARY STAGE S IS YEAH, THE THINGS THE COMMUNITY TOLD US. AND OTHER MASTER USE POLICIES. LET'S GO.  SO --
03:09:52.433: >> YEAH.  AND WHAT YOU TALKED ABOUT IN TERMS OF THE ENGAGEMENT AND BRINGING THAT FORWAR YOU KNOW, KIND OF QUANTIFYING THAT, HAVING THAT LIST I THINK THAT WILL HELP US SAY WE GOT A LOT OF INPUT IN THIS.  THIS IS NOT US PICKING THAT OUT OF THIN AIR. THANK YOU FOR HIGHLIGHTING THAT. I HAVE ONE MORE THING, COMMISSIONER SAUVE.  AND THE OTHER THING IS THANK YOU MR. LENART FOR HIGHLIGHTING AND THIS IS WHAT I WOULD CHALLENGE THEM TO THINK ABOUT TOO IS WHAT WE SHOULD GET RID OF.  NOT ADDING THIS TO OUR TOME OF MASTER PLAN BUT WHAT IS THIS -- IS IT SUPERSEDE IS THAT THE WORD?  WHAT CAN WE PIT -- PITCH OUT?  JUST ADDING MORE IS NOT HELPFUL I THINK. WHEN WE SEE THIS AGAIN IN THREE MONTHS TIME, FOUR MONTHS TIME, HAVING THAT, SO THAT WE CAN DO THOSE THINGS TOGETHER AND NOT -- AND IT DOESN'T GET LOST, WILL BE REALLY, REALLY BENEFICIAL I TH THINK.
03:11:03.838: >> YOU MEAN WHETHER EXISTING PLANS.
03:11:06.707: >> I I LIKE THAT YOU PUT THIS IN HISTORICAL CONTEXT BUT AT SOME POINT THERE ARE SOME THINGS. VISIONS OF CHANGED. RIGHT?  THIS BUILDS ON ITSELF AND IT HIGHLIGHTS THAT WE HAVE MADE TREMENDOUS STRIDES. MR. COOPER AND COMPANY HAVE MADE TREMENDOUS STRIDES IN IMPLEMENTING THOSE.  THEY'RE, YOU KNOW, THERE MAY BE SOME ELEMENTS THAT NEED TO GO AND I WOULD SAY TOO YOU GUYS KNOW THIS A LITTLE BIT BETTER.  MAYBE THI MR. LENART LINKS INTO OUR OVALL MASTER PLANNING.  SOME OF THEM MAY BE IN THE ANSPORTATION PLANS BUT SOME OF THEM MAY NOT B SPECIFIC TRANSPORTATION PLANS BUT MAYBE OTHER ELEMENTS OF OUR MASTER AN THAT CALL FOR, FOR EXAMPLE, PARKING MAXIMUMS.  SO R THAN COMMISSIONER SAUVE.
03:12:03.097: >>HANKS.  I WAN TO HIGHLIGHT THAT THERE --  REE, WE' A THE POINT OF, LIKE IMPLEMENTINGLIKE, ADOING THIS TNG BUT THEREL BE ALSO ENGAGEMENT GNG FORWARDECAUSE RECOMMENDATIS TO BECOME THERDNANCE CHAES AND THAT REQUIRES ADDIONAL ENGEMENT AN SO IHINK WE'RE AT THIS ENGAGEMENT ECATION ENGEMENT EP AND THATDUCATION AND THE OUTRCH TO LET T COMMUNITY KNOW THAT THIS IS AN EMPOWERIN DOCUME TO GIVE PEOE MORE ACCESS TO ARE IN THE CITY IS HUGE. ND LIKE, AS COMMISSIERS, WVE GOT THE CITY TO DO LOT OFHE DISSINATIONND THEIR TLS THINGS BUT AS COMSSIONERS AND HAVINGOARD REESENTATIVES, W ARE LISTRIBUTEDITHIN OUR OWN COUNY TO SHARE THIS AND THEN COMMUNIEMBERS WE MAY T BE WITH THE TABLE AND S THISS COMING.  ARE YOUAWARE ORDINANCESHAT WILL PROBAYE PACTED AND CNGED BY THIS IN E FUTURE.  WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO BE A PARTICIPATORY ENGAGEMENT IN THOSE ORDINANCE CHANGE DISCUSSIONS IN THE FUTURE TOO. I THINK THERE'S KIND OF A PATTERN STILL MOVING FORWARD.  I WANT TO SAY THAT IN TERMS OF ALL OF US DOING OUR PART AS COMMISSIONERS TO CONTINUE THAT CONVERSATION AS THIS GET ADOPTED TOO.  I THINK IT COMMUNICATES REALLY WELL BUT IT'S THE DISSEMINATION THAT WE CAN ALL DO TO HELP IT MOVE FORWARD IN THAT REGARD.  SO, YEAH, I -- THERE WAS ONE OTHER THING.  I DON'T KNOW.  I AM JUST REALLY EXCITED TO SEE IT HAPPEN.  I'LL JUST KEEP AYE S -- SAYING IT.  YEAH, WE'LL SEE ORDINANCES CHANGE. BUT AS A MASTER DOCUMENT.  WE GET A LOT OF FEEDBACK NOW. MASTER DOCUMENTS AS XYZ UNTIL IT HAH HAS COORDINATES.  THERE'S MORE WORK TO DO AS WELL ON OUR PART SO THANKS FOR GETTING IT THIS FAR.
03:14:16.664: >> I JUST WANT TO KIND OF ECHO NOT ONLY IN THIS TRANSPORTATION PLANNING REALM IS IT ABOUT ORDINANCES, RULES AND REGULATIONS BUT THIS ALSO CREATES A SET OF EXPECTATIONS FOR FUTURE TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENTS AND PROJECTS.  SO THAT THIS IS A MULTIFACETED TYPE OF MASTER PLAN ELEMENT THERE ARE THE PIECES THAT WILL BECOME POLICY, RULES, REGULATIONS, ORDINANCES OF THE TYPE BUT THERE'S ALSO PROJECTS AND EACH ONE OF THOSE IMPLEMENTATION ACTIVITIES DOES HAVE, AS YOU CLEARLY AND CORRECTLY NOTED HAS ITS OWN INDIVIDUAL ENGAGEMENT PROCESS SO WE'LL CONTINUE, YOU KNOW, AFTER THE PLAN GOES THROUGH THESE TWO ROUNDS OF, YOU KNOW, FIRST STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AND THEN FINALLY, THE FINAL STEP TOWARDS FINAL ADOPTION, THAT'S THE BEGINNING OF THE PLAN IMPLEMENTATION. IT'S NOT THE END OF PLANNING. SO THERE'S A LOT MORE ROOM FOR US TO GO AND GROW IN OUR OUTREACH AND COMMUNICATION AND OUR INTERRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE VARIOUS ELEMENTS WHETHER IT'S A-0, WHETHER IT'S PLANNING AND SO FORTH.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR INSIGHTFUL INPUT AND I THINK THAT YOU'RE -- YOU CLEARLY ARE ON A PATH TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS MERELY A POINT IN TIME. IT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT IN TIME AND I APPRECIATE THE ENTHUSIASM AND EXCITEMENT ABOUT IT BUT WE'VE GOT SO MUCH MORE AHEAD OF U US.
03:16:02.603: >> ANYTHING ELSE?  MR. LENART? I THINK WE'RE READY TO VOTE. 
03:16:16.583: >> COMMISSIONER .
03:16:36.570: >> (CHORUS OF AYES).
03:16:38.906: >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.  WE'LL SEE YOU IN A FEW MONTHS.
03:16:41.475: >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.  I APPRECIATE IT.  BYE.
03:16:44.478: >> ITEM ELEVEN, PUBLIC COMMENT. THIS IS THE FINAL OPPORTUNITY FOR PERSONS TO SPEAK FOR UP TO THREE MINUTES ABOUT ANY ITEM OF INTEREST, PUBLIC COMMENT MAY BE MADE BY CALLING 8778535247 AND THEN ENTERINGEETING ID 975 97519942176.  CITY STAFF WILL RECOGNIZE YOU BY THE LAST FOUR DIGITS OF YOUR TELEPHONE NUMBER. YOU WILL HEAR AN AUTOMATED ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE HOST IS ALLOWING YOU TO SPEAK. MR. LENART WILL TELL YOU THAT TOO AND PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS AT THE BEGINNING OF YOUR COMMENTS.  THERE IS THE LAG WITH TV.  SOMETIMES.  BUT I DON'T SEE ANYONE CALLING IN.
03:17:35.195: >> LOOKING SPARSE.
03:17:35.929: >> I'M GOING TO PROPOSE THAT WE MOVE ONTO COMMISSION PROPOSED BUSINESS BECAUSE I DO HAVE SOMETHING.
03:17:42.036: >> I'LL KEEP AN EYE OUT.
03:17:43.437: >> YEAH.  I HAVE SOMETHING BUT DOES ANYONE ELSE HAVE ANYTHING THAT THEY WANT TO BRING UP? OKAY.  MR. LENART.
03:17:53.180: >> I JUST WANT TO MAYBE PUT A BIT OF A POINT ON THE LAST CONVERSATION AND A BIT OF A CHALLENGE TO US AS WE TAKE ON THE ASPECTS THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE LEADING THAT COMES OUT OF THIS PLAN OR THE OTHER.  I THINK IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO SET THE EXAMPLE THAT WE WANT FOR THAT ENGAGEMENT.  HOW IT LOOKS. SO I WOULD JUST ASK YOU TO BE PARTNERS IN THAT TO MAKE SURE THAT, YOU KNOW, THAT IF I HOPE YOU DON'T NEED TO CHALLENGE ME BUT I HOPE IT'S TO GUIDE ME AND HELP US ALL SUCCEED IN THAT ENDEAVOR SO, YOU KNOW, I THINK ENGAGEMENT IS CRITICAL AND IT'S HARD AND AS HARD AS YOU TRY YOU CAN LOOK BACK ON IT AND FEEL THAT YOU ARE STILL LACKING SOMETHING.  SO THAT'S JUST TO SAY THAT I -- BASED ON OUR WORK PROGRAM, I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF SUPPORT AND ALIGNMENT FOR US TO REALLY THINK ABOUT THAT CREATIVELY AS WE START TAKING ON THE ASPECTS THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE LEADING.
03:19:10.691: >> GREAT.  THERE'S TO  -- TWO ITEMS THAT I WOULD PROPOSE. BOTH OF THEM CAME UP TONIGHT. ONE IS REGULATING ON BEDROOMS RATHER THAN ON UNITS OR SQUARE FOOTAGE.  RIGHT?  IF OUR DISTRICTS.  YOU'RE LIMITED IF YOU WANT TO BUILD STUDIOS YOU GET SIX STUDIOS.  IF YOU ARE BUILDING BEDROOMS YOU GET SIX BEDROOMS.  THAT COMES UP WITH PARKING BUT I THINK THAT TRAN SENDS PARKING EVEN IF WE CHANGE PARKING IT DOESN'T CHANGE THAT IDEA.  AND SO I WOULD PROPOSE NOT THAT WE CHANGE OUR EXISTING WORK PLAN BUT I PROPOSE THAT WE, MR. LENART, MAKE A COMMENT TO ADD TO THAT ORANGE TABLE OF POTENTIAL FUTURE PROJECTS THAT THAT DOESN'T GET LOST BECAUSE THAT'S NOT ON THERE RIGHT NOW OR INCLUDED.  WE DON'T VOTE ON THESE THINGS.
03:20:11.084: >> NO, WHAT I WOULD PROBABLY DO IS JUST ADD IT IN THERE AS A NOTATION.
03:20:18.091: >> YEAH.
03:20:18.325: >> -- FOR OUR USE AND THEN IT WOULD -- WE CAN EITHER TAKE ACTION ON IT OR IT WOULD JUST APPEAR WITH A NOTATION AND BECOME BASICALLY MORE FORMAL THE NEXT TIME.
03:20:29.703: >> I THINK -- AND HA WHAT I WOULD SUGGEST IS THAT MAYBE IF WE COULD PUT THE ADDRESS FOR THIS PROPOSAL TO JOG OUR MEMORY ABOUT WHY THIS WAS -- IT MIGHT MAKE OUR WORK A LITTLE BIT EASIER AND THE OTHER ONE IS AND I ASKED MR. LENART ABOUT THIS BEFORE BECAUSE I WENT BACK TO OUR WORK PLAN IS WHAT HAPPENED TO OUR R 24C IN OUR WORK PLAN AND WE DID TAKE IT OFF.  I COULDN'T REMEMBER WHY AND IT COULD HAVE BEEN BECAUSE IT WAS HARD.  IT WAS HARD BECAUSE OF PARKING.  AND IF WE'RE ALREADY ADDRESSING PARKING, THEN THERE ARE STILL SOME OTHER ELEMENTS OF R 4C, R 2A-R 4C THAT ARE LESS CONTROVERSIAL IF THE PARKING THING IS NO LONGER AN ISSUE. THAT IS THAT -- I WANT TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT THE PROJECT WE HEARD ONLY WORKS -- ONE OF THE LOTS IS NONCONFORMING.  IT'S NOT WIDE ENOUGH.  I DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH LOT FRONTAGE AND NOT ENOUGH SQUARE FOOTAGE SO THE ONLY THING TO DEVELOP THERE IS A SINGLE UNIT.  THAT'S -- AND THAT IT'S NONCONFORMING IS NOT A WEIRD THING FOR ITSELF.  THERE'S LIKE 80% OF THE LOTS IN THAT ZONING DISTRICT WHICH IS IN A LOT OF PLACES IN THE CITY ARE NONCONFORMING THE ONLY WAY THEY CAN BUILD ANYTHING IS TO COMBINE LOTS.  AND THEN YOU GET TO THE LIKE, MULTIPLIER THRESHOLD SO PRETTY MUCH YOU'RE GOING TO SEE FOUR UNIT BUILDINGS.  YOU WILL SEE MORE THAN THAT SO THAT'S THE THING THAT WON'T BE FIXED BY FIXING THE PARKING BUT THAT I THINK WE NEED TO ADDRESS IS THAT NONCONFORMITY BECAUSE IT IS A MULTIFAMILY DISTRICT BUT SO MANY OF THE LOTS ONLY ALLOW FOR A SINGLE FAMILY DWELLING AND THAT'S PROBLEMATIC.  I WANTTO ADD THAT BACK TO THE TABLE AND I WOULD WANT TO TAKE CARE OF THE P PARKING FIRST MAY MAKE THAT CONVERSATION EASIER BUT IT WILL NOT SOLVE THE WHOLE THING. COMMISSIONER SAUVE AND THING COMMISSIONER DISH.
03:22:49.910: >> I AM CURIOUS ABOUT THAT IN THE CIRCUL MOTION OF FOLLOWING BACK ON THE RECOMMENDATION OF SMALL PROJECTS IN ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS IS A THRESHOLD FOR NOT SITE PLAN FOR MAYBE SIX UNITS.  AND IF WE LOOK AT THAT AND GET RESPONSE FROM CITY COUNCIL, YES, LOOK AT THAT AND IF R 4C NOW DOESN'T REQUIRE SITE PLANNING WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE?  IF IT WAS -- BECAUSE IF IT DOESN'T REQUIRE SITE PLANNING --
03:23:24.878: >> I DON'T THINK IT WOULD HELP TOO MUCH BECAUSE EVEN WHEN YOU'RE NOT SITE PLANNING YOU HAVE TO MEET AREA HEIGHT PLACEMENT REQUIREMENTS SO IF THE LOT IS STILL NON-CON FORMING AND IF THE ORDNANCE SAYS THAT YOU CAN ONLY DO SINGLE FAMILY NOT GOING THROUGH THE SITE PLAN WILL NOT HELP.
03:24:04.618: >> I'M TRYG TO FIGUR OUT THOUSAND  HOW TO USE THE WORK PLAN AS-IS. I WOULD S 80 ALREA USE Z THE PLACES IS TH FAIR . LENART
03:24:34.481: >> YES.  I WAS GNG TO BE MORE GOT AADUS THAT YOU WANT TO TACKE FIT AND WE HAVE TRANSIT DEVELOENT DUE TOITY COUNC BY NEXT NE. E'REOING T TAKE ONSITE PLAN REEW EL WE'RE PREY SET ON THA R I T WE HAVE TO GO THUGH THAT PROCS OF COURS O I IANT TO SET THE REALISTIC EXPECTION AT I'M SOMEWHERE I THE MILE.  I SEE Y PUT A LOT O INGS AS PRIORITY FIRST.  SO I WOULD SAY IT'S PERSONALLY ADDED TO THE WORK PLAN FOR NOW BUT PROBABLY GOING TO HAVE TO TACKLE SOME OF THESE OTHER THINGS FIRST AND THAT'S OKAY TO SEE WHAT DOES THE LANDSCAPE LOOK LIKE AFTER YOU LOOK AT THE PROCESS.  MAYBE AFTER DISCUSSIONS OF RESIDENTIAL ZONING.  SO PERFECTLY GREAT TO ADD IT ON THERE.  I JUST WANT TO CAUTION YOU THAT IT WILL BE CHALLENGING TO TAKE IT UP QUICKLY.
03:26:12.212: >> I WANT TO TUCK IT IN THERE BECAUSE OF WHAT COMMISSIONER SAUVE RAISES THE POINT.  IT'S ABOUT THE FIRST POINT ABOUT UNITS OR BEDROOMS.  THAT COMES UP THAT'S LINKED TO WHAT'S THE THRESHOLD FOR THE SMALL PROJECTS.
03:26:30.864: >> IT WAS NOT -- THAT WAS NOT ORIGINALLY.  THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT RESONATE WITH THE COMMISSION AS SOMETHING TO WIDELY APPLY.  IT IS SOMETHING TO CONSIDER FOR SURE.
03:26:40.941: >> I'M JUST SAYING I THINK WE PUT IT DOWN.  WE DON'T PUT IT ELEVATE IT BUT IT MAY WELCOME BACK THAT IT'S A HANGUP BECAUSE A SMALL UNIT SIX STUDIOS IS QUITE A DIFFERENT IMPACT THAN SIX BEDROOMS.  WHAT WE SAW TONIGHT WAS --
03:27:01.728: >> WHERE THAT'S COMING FROM IS OUR OCCUPANCY, RIGHT?  WE WERE REGULATING BY OCCUPANCY.  I THINK WHAT YOU'RE SEEING THERE IS A REFLECTION OF MARKETABILITY TO SOME EXTENT.  NOT THAT I PROFESS SO KNOW ALL THE INS AND OUTS OF THAT DEPARTMENT BUT YOU CAN SEE THE PEOPLE IN THAT DISTRICT.  TO MAXIMIZE THE VALUE OF THAT IT'S MUCH MORE VALUABLE IF ONE OF THOSE SIX PEOPLE HAVE A BEDROOM AND A BATHROOM AND IN THIS CASE, THE CHOICE OF KITCHENS SO -- BUT I WOULD, YOU KNOW -- THAT HAS OTHER -- I'M NOT SAYING THAT WE DON'T LOOK AT IT BUT THAT HAS OTHER PARAMETER THEN WE HAVE TO LOOK AT HOW WE MIGHT NOT BE REGULATING ON OCCUPANCY ANYMORE.  SO IT JUST -- IT MIGHT HAVE OTHER SORT OF VEINS IN OUR CODE THAT WE NEED TO CONSIDER AS WELL.
03:27:57.150: >> COMMISSIONER DISH, SORRY.
03:28:04.658: >> I WANTED SO SAY THAT YOU READ MY MIND, SARA, BECAUSE I WANTED TO  BRING UP LOT SIECHLTZ THE ISSUE ISSUE OF R 2A.  I WANT TOED TO SPEAK TO MR. LEN LENART WHO TOLD ME WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PUT IT ON OUR NEAR TERM. BECAUSE IN THE PLACES WHERE YOU HAVE R 2 ZONING WHERE YOU COULD DO A MULTIFAMILY THING BUT THE MINIMUM -- YOUR HOUSE IS ON A MINIMUM LOT SIZE THAT WON'T ACTUALLY LET YOU WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO BECAUSE NOW THE MARKET WILL REWARD YOU IS KNOCK THAT LITTLE SUCKER DOWN DOWN AND BUILD A THREE THOUSAND TO FOUR THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT SINGLE FAMILY WHICH IS REALLY NOT THE DIRECTION WE WANT TO GO.  SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE DO NEED TO MOVE ON BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE -- THERE IS NOW BECAUSE OF THE WAY PRICES HAVE GONE THAT IT'S REALLY A VERY DIFFERENT SEAN THAN IT WAS TWELVE YEARS AGO.  THERE WAS INCENTIVE TO REDEVETHESE PROPERTIES AND SO MAKE IT AFFORDABLE OR PUT SOME SOLAR ON IT.  DO BOTH AND WE'LL GIVE YOU A GOLD WATCH.  I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING WE NEED TO LOOK AT AND I AM DELIGHTED YOU BRIGHT UP BECAUSE I WAS GOING TO.
03:29:30.510: >> MAYBE IT NEEDS TO MOVE FROM THE LOW-LOW TO AS HIGHER UP IF THERE'S MULTIPLE OF US. HONESTLY, THAT'S THE THING THOUGH THAT HAS BEEN ON FOR THE LAST SIX YEARS, LIKE, AND THAT WAS -- THAT WAS GOING ON WELL BEFORE THE SIX YEARS.  LIKE, COMMISSIONER WOODS PROBABLY COULD HAVE TOLD US WHEN IT'S FIRST BROUGHT UP.  IT WAS ON THERE FOREVER.  A LOT OF SIT -- IT IS THE PARKING.  IS THAT FAIR, ALEX?  IF THAT IS ALLEVIATED FROM ANOTHER ACTION THAT IS NOT SPECIFIC TO THOSE DISTRICTS BUT THAT IS CITY-WIDE AS THE PROPOSED TRANSPORTATION PLAN CALLS FOR, THAT CHANGES THINGS IN MY MIND COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN.
03:30:19.559: >> IN TWELVE YEARS, LOOK AT HOW MUCH THINGS HAVE CHANGED WITH ROADS AND LOT SIZE.  WE'RE KNOCKING DOWN AND BUILDING THAT'S SOMETHING WE HAVE TO VERY COGNIZANT OF.  EVEN SIX YEARS, LET'S SAY TEN YEARS AGO WE NEVER THOUGHT THAT WOULD HAPPEN AND LOOK AT IT NOW. THAT'S SOMETHING WE HAVE TO BE COGNIZANT OF.  I THINK IT'S -- FROM -- I READ -- THIS WAS YEARS AGO.  WHEN I FIRST START ON PLANNING COMMISSION, THE WORKGROUP THAT WAS SET UP, THE CITIZEN GROUP THAT WAS SET UP, THID A TON OF WORK AND I -- THE REPORT -- LIKE THEY MET, I THINK FOR A YEAR SOLID IF NOT CLOSE TO TWO YEARS.  AND IN THE END, THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE IT WORK.  YEAH I THINK THEY CAME UP WITH A FEW PROPOSALS BUT IT'S SUCH A HUGE UNDERTAKING.  THE REASON IT IS PART OF THE WORK PLAN IS IT'S MORE THAN US TAKING IT ON AS A PLANNING COMMISSION OR A STAFF. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT A CONSULTANT ACTUALLY NEEDS TO TAKE ON AND SEE IT FROM A DIFFERENT LENS BECAUSE IT IS SUCH A HUGE PROJECT.  I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW IT COULD BE ACCOMPLISHED BY, YOU KNOW, WE CAN -- NIBBLE AT IT HERE AND THERE.  BUT I -- AS A -- AS AN UNDERTAKING AS A WHOLE, THAT'S SUCH A HUGE PROJECT.
03:32:03.763: >> YOU THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO TAKE -- THEY'VE ALWAYS BEEN LUMPED TOGETHER.  IS THERE LOGIC IN SORT OF SEPARATING R 2 VERSUS R 4C.  I KNOW THERE MIGHT BE SOME SIMILAR ISSUES.
03:32:16.576: >> PERSONALLY I THINK R 4C NEEDS TO BE DEALT WITH FIRST AND MAYBE THEY WERE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH -- OR COULDN'T ACCOMPLISH IN BOTH BUT I WOULD SAY R 4C WOULD BE THE BIGGEST ONE THAT I WOULD GO AFTER. FIRST.
03:32:37.964: >> AND THEN JUST ABSOLUTELY DEVELOPING HERE WITHOUT THINKING FULLY.  A LOT OF OUR ORDINANCE DEFAULTS TO IF NOT SOME STANDARD YOU CAN DO SINGLE FAMILY, RIGHT? WHAT'S YOUR INITIAL REACTION TO THAT IF THAT -- IF NOT YOU CAN DO THIS.  ALL RIGHT.  TWO YESES. FOUR NOT SURES.  YEAH.
03:33:11.097: >> IT'S AFTER TEN SO IT'S A --
03:33:13.499: >> I'M NEW.  THAT'S --
03:33:16.536: >> YEAH.  YEAH.  NO.  I WAS JUST THINKING THAT WOULD BE SORT OF NIBBLING AROUND THE EDGES OF R 4C BASICALLY WHERE YOU COULD INCREASE THE POTENTIAL VIABILITY, ECONOMIC MODEL FOR A LOT OF NONCONFORMING PROPERTIES AT LEAST BY POTENTIALLY DOUBLING THEM FROM A SINGLE UNIT TO TWO UNITS.  LIKEWISE, BE A RELATIVELY QUICK FIX IN THE R 2 DISTRICTS.  THAT WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT.  PROBABLY JUST THE EFFECT OF ELIMINATING IT IN THE R 2 DISTRICTS.  WE'VE SEEN A LOT MORE R 4C STUFF OF COURSE.  THEN EVEN I WOULD SAY R 2A PERMITS WHICH AREN'T GOING TO COME TO YOU TYPICALLY.
03:34:07.420: >> COMMISSIONER MILLS.
03:34:08.588: >> SO I FEEL LIKE WE HAVE -- R 4C WHICH IS IN THE MIDDLE OF ALL THESE OTHER THINGS THAT WE WANT TO ACCOMPLISH ON OUR WORK PLAN. A LOT OF IT GOES AROUND THE R 4C.  WHAT'S THE CHANCES, BRET THAT THE CITY CAN HIRE A CONSULTANT SOMEONE TO HELP WITH THIS TO TACKLE R 4C BUT THEN ALSO HELP US WITH SOME OF THESE OTHER THINGS THAT WE HAVE AROUND THAT?  JUST BECAUSE --
03:34:38.084: >> YEAH.  I'LL PROBABLY BE A BETTER POSITION TO RESPOND TO THAT IN A COUPLE MONTHS ONCE THE BUDGET PROCESS GETS STARTED.  MY INITIAL THOUGHT IS BASED ON THE FACT THAT THE MASTER PLAN DID NOT GO FORWARD BECAUSE OF FINANCIAL IMPACT TO THE CITY BECAUSE OF COVID. PARKING REVENUES, UTILITY USE REVENUE, THOSE ARE STILL VERY MUCH REAL FACTORS THAT THE CITY'S GOING TO BE RECONCILING WITH.  I'M NOT SPEAKING TO THAT YET.  I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WILL BE DOING WITH MY BUDGET.  IF THAT IS.  TRY TO KEEP YOUR INCREASE OR BE FLAT.  IOULD SAY IT'S POSSIBLE IF THAT DIRECTIVE IS BASED ON OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES HERE WE ACTUALLY NEED TO LOOK ANOTHER -- AT HOW 'RE GOO CUT COSTS.  I BE PRETTY (FADES OUT).Y GOING TO
03:35:43.116: >> COMMISSNER SAUV
03:35:45.618: >> I THINK THE CONVERSATION ABOUT ADE AS BEING ON THE WORK PLAN AND THE IDEA OF DUPLEXING AND WHAT THAT MEANS IN TERMS OF LIKE -- WHAT IS ANTTACHED A AND THE POLICY BEHIND A ADU AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT EQUITY, OWNERSHIP, ACCESSILITY AND HOUSIN I THINK THEY'RE VERY SIMILAR ACTUAL.  MAYBE IT'S A WORKINSESSION TO EVEN JUST WORK THROUGH THE NUANCES OF WHAT WITH THE TERMSF IF WE LOOK A AT AND MAYBE AS TAK A STEP BACK BECSE WE COULD SVE DENSITON THE SITES IN A DIERENT WAY.  NOW,IKE WHEN YOU SAY DUEX IT MAK YOU INK ABOUT ADUS AN THE IDEA OF R 4CND R 2A A WHAT GETS US MORE DENSITY AND WHAT'S THE REON BEHIND A POLICY
