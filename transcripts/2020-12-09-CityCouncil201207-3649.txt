00:05:57.658: >> AYE. OPPOSED? APPROVED. MR. CRAWFORD, COMMUNICATIONS TODAY FROM OUR C CITY ADMINISTRATOR.
00:06:12.573: >> City Administrator:  YES, SIR. THE FIRST THING IS A COUPLE OF ANNOUNCEMENTS. ANN ARBOR WAS RECENTLY AWARDED THE VISIT EVERY PARK PROGRAM THAT WE HAD OVER COVID. IT WON AN AWARD FOR ONE OF THE THE MOST INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS IN THE STATE OF MICHIGAN FOR HOW IT CONTRIBUTED TO HELP DURING COVID AND PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO DO THINGS WHEN THERE WAS SUCH DIFFICULTY. WE ALSO GOT THE AWARD RECOGNIZING EXCELLENCE IN THE PRESENTATION OF COMPLICATED FINANCIAL THAT WE HAVE. AND THEN LASTLY, I WANTED TO MENTION THE A20 AMBASSADORS PROGRAM, A PROGRAM WHICHCH RESIDECAN SIGN UP FOR. THE FIRST GROUP I BEING READY TO START, WHERE RESIDENTS LEARN ABOUT SUSTAINABILITY AND CARBON NEUTRALITY AND HOW THEY CAN OPERATIONALIZE THAT INTO THEIR EVERYDAY LIVES AND MAKE CHANGES IN OUR CITY AND THE WORLD. THAT'S A NEW PROGRAM THAT WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT. WHERE I WANTED TO SPEND A FEW MINUTES OF TIME THIS MORNING, OR THIS EVENING, COUNCIL, IS IN PREPARATION FOR THE DECEMBER 14 OFFSITE THAT YE NEXT WEEK I I I YCREEN ON A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND ON SOME MATERIALS THAT YOU'LL BE RECEIVING -- OR THAT'S ATTACHED TO THIS AGENDA AND WE'LL BE DISCUSSING AT THAT MEETING. WHAT I'VE DONE HERE IS, AND WHAT I WANTED TO SHARE WITH YOU TONIGHT, ARE A LITTLE BIT -- I'M SORRY. I'M SWITCHING MY SCREEN SO I CAN SEE BETTER. THERE WE GO. ANN ARBOR HAS A HISTORY OF TRYING TO PRIOR FIES AND PLAN -- PRIORITIZE AND PLAN ALL OF THE MANY ACTION AND POLHAT COUNCIL HAS. AND SOME OF THAT IS REFLECTED IN THIS GRAPHIC THAT YOU CAN SEE ON THE SCREEN. BACK IN 2013 WE CREATED THE US SUSTAINABILITY FRAMEWORK, KIND OF 16 OVERARCHING GOALS. THAT WAS DEVELOPED BY LOOKING OUT OVER 20 PLANS THAT THE CITY HAD APPROVED AT THAT TIME. AND IT CREATED A FRAMEWORK FOR WHICH WE TRIED TO MOVE THE COMMUNITY FORWARD THROUGH SUSTAINABLE EFFORTS IF WE FOLLOWED EVERYTHING IN 2014 THEL STRATEGIC PLAN. IT WAS AN ATTEMPT TO TAKE THE ORGANIZATION AND ALIGN IT AROUND SOME POLLS THAT WERE NEEDED TO CREATE ORGANIZATIONAL EXCELLENCE. IN 2018, WE PERFORMED A SURVEY OF RESIDENTS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THEIR PRIORITIES AS THE COUNCIL AND THE CITY HAVE A BUDGET THAT'S APPROVED EACH YEAR. AND THEN 2019 WE START A PRIORITY-BASED BUDGETING S YLE --TARTED A NEW PROGRAM CALLED PRIORITY-SED BUDGETIING. AS WE LOOK TO A NEW TOOL TO SUPPLEMENT THE WAY WE'VE BEEN BUDGETING IN THE PAST. THE PURPOSE OF THIS TOOL IS TO HELP THE COUNCIL, THE COMMUNITY, UNDERSTAND THE BUDGET FROM THE CONTEXT OF PRIORITIES AND NOT JUST DOLLARS. AND THIS IS PARTICULARLY USEFUL WHEN YOU HAVE A LIMITED RESOURCES AND YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE THE TRADEOFF THAT YOU NEED IN ORDER TO MOVE THINGS FORWARD. SO, WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE TONIGHT, AND WE'LL TALK MORE ABOUT ON 149TH 14TH,S TH FRAMEWORK THE STAFF WORKED ON I ORDER TO BRING THOSEHING TOGETHER. I CALL IT A STRATEGIC PLAN BUT IT HAS WHAT SOME OF YOU MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH AS WHAT MAY -- WHAT MAY SEEM FAMILIAR TO SOME OF YOU AS THE TRADITIONAL WAY OF LOOKING AT A STRATEGIC PLAN. IT HAS A MISSION WHICH TELLS YOU WHY YOU'RE HERE A VISION THAT TELLS YOU WHERE YOU'RE GOING -- THOSE ARE BRIEF STATEMENTS -- IT HAS GOALS, OBJECTIVES, AND INITIATIVES. AND ON THE RIGHT-HAND GRAPHIC, YOU CAN SEE THEY START OUT VERY BROAD AND GET NARROW. WHATHATE BROADER THINGS YOU DON'T REALL CHANGE THAT FREQUENTLY. YOUR VISION AND MISSION AND OFTEN YOUR GOALS STAY SOMEWHAT CONSTANT OVER TIME. BUT THE OBJECTIVES AND INITIATIVES CAN CHANGE AS TO YOUR EFFECTIVENESS. YOU'RE CONSTANTLY -- NOT CONSTANTLY, BUT YOU'RE CHANGING THESE AS YOU NEED TO IN ORDER TO AFFECT THE CHANGES THAT YOU WANT TO SEE. SO, WITH THAT IN MIND, IN POLLING PIECES, I WOULD SAY MOST OF WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THROUGH THIS PLAN -- I HAVEN'T COUNTED EVYTHING WOULD Y 80% ARE COMING FROM PLANS THAT COUNCIL HAS ALREADY APPROVED. MAYBE ANOTHER 10% COMES FROM STAFF IDEAS TO ADDRESS SOME GAPS. AND A FINAL 10% COME FROM INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS THAT WERE DONE. SO IN THIS CASE, THE MISSION STATEMENT IS WHAT WAS IN THE CITY'S ORIGINAL INTERNAL STRATEGIC PLAN. THAT'S LISTED HERE IN BLUE. THE MISSION IS TO DELIVER EXCEPTIONAL SERVIAT SUSTAINED AD VIBRANT, SAFE, AND DIVERSE THE VISION STATEMENT IS ONE, TO BE HONEST, THAT IS A DRAFT I JU CREATED IN ORDER FOR YOU GUYS TO CONSIDER. WE'LL TOUCH BASE ON THIS AT THE OFFSITE. WE CAN MAKE CHANGES TO THAT. I WANTED TO DOCUMENT SOMETHING TO GET YOU STARTED THAT I THOUGHT REFLECTED MANY OF THE CONVERSATION THAT I'VE HAD WITH YOU IN THE TIME THAT I'VE SPENT WITH THE ORGANIZATION TO TRY TO GET YOU STARTED ON SOMETHING. WHEN IT GOT DOWN TO GOALS, I WANTED TO -- SE OFOF AOU NEW OUUT I WANTED TO REACH BACK AND REFRESH YOUR MEMORY A LITTLE BIT. WH THEITY SRTED PRIORITY-BASUDGETING OVER A YEAR AGO, WE BROUG TOGETHE LOTF PLANS INTOHIS MATRIX THAT YOU SEE ON THE SCREE NOW. AND TH YELLOW BOXES REFCT THE THE BLOXES REPRESENT ITE. THAT CAME FROM THE RESIDENT SURVEY. AND YOU'LL SEE SOME BOXES THAT ARE BOTH BLUE AND Y Y YW. 'S WHERE THERE W W W OVERLAPBETD THE SUSTAINABILITY FRAMEWORK. AND THEN THE GREEN BOXES REFLECT THE ORGANIZATIONAL STRATEGIC PLAN THAT THE CITY -- THE INTERNAL ONE THE CITY HAD DONE. WHEN WE PULLED ALL OF THIS TOGETHER, COUNSEL SAIL PROVED THIS AS THE PRIORITY MATRIX THAT WE WOULD USE GOING FORWARD. SO ACROSS THE TOP ARE GREEN BOXES WHICH SHOW THE SIX WHAT I'M CALLING NOW GOALS THAT COUNCIL BASICALLY ADOPTED BACK IN JAN. A SAFE, ENGAGED VIBRANT COMMUNITY, DIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION. THOSE ACROSS THE TOP. SO, WITH THAT, AS YOU CAN SEE, THIS PULLS FROM THE MANY DIFFERENT THINGS THAT COUNCIL HAS DONE OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS. AND IT'S SEEKING TO PUT THEM IN A FRAMEWORK THAT WE CAN USE GOING FORWARD. A GRAPHIC THAT WE'VE USED INTERNALLY BEFORE IS THIS ONE, WHICH SHOWS KIND OF A VISION, A MISSION, AT THE TOP. THESE GREEN BOXES IN THE MIDDLE ILLUSTRATE THE GOAL BOXES. OF THE AND STAFF WILLDOING WILLE WITH OBJECTIVES AND INITIATIVES IN ORDER TO MOVE THE GOALS FORWARD. THESE GREEN BOXES ARE THE SAME AS COLUMNS YOU SAW ON THE LAST PAGE. FOR EXAMPLE, A SAFE, ENGAGED VIBRANT COMMUNITY. A DIVERSE, EQUITABLE -- THOSE ARE TWO SEPARATE GOALS. AND AT THE BOTTOM IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR CORE VALUES OR PRINCIPLES ARE AS YOU LOOK TO SOLVE CHALLENGING PROBLEMS. YOU WANT TO LOOK BACK TO YOUR CORE VALUES AND YOUR PRINCIPLES TRADEOFFS, YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE BEARING THESE THINGS IN MIND AS YOU MAKE DECISIONS. THIS IS THE FRAMEWORK FOR WHICH I'M TALKING ABOUT THAT I'D LIKE US DISCUSS FURTHER. LASTLY, I PUT THIS IN THE DOCUMENT WHICH IS ATTACHED TO THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR'S COMMUNICATION ITEM HERE THIS SEPARATE DOCUMENT IS CALLED ANN ARBOR STRATEGIC PLAN 2021. I THINK IT'S VERSION 1, WHAT'S OUT THERE. THIS IS WHAT YOU'LL SEE. IT'S AOR TYPE DOCUMENT THAT STARTS WITH THE S GOALS. THERE ARE -- THERE'S A PAGE OR TWO FOR EACH GOAL. YOU'LL SEE THE GOAL STATED. A DESCRIPTION OF WHAT THAT GOAL MEANS IN WORDS. STAFF HAS COME UP WITH FIVE OR SIX OBJECTIVES THAT WE BELIEVE WOULD ADVANCE -- ADVANCE THE GOALS TO SUCCESS. AND AT THE BOTTOM WE'VE TAKEN EACH OF THOSE OBJECTIVES. YOU'LL SEE FIRST ONE SAYS CONSTITUENTS FEEL SAFE IN BOTH THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD AND THE BROADER COMMUNITY. N YOU D TO THE TARGETS AND YOU'LL SEE THAT'S REPEATED IN THE LEFT COLUMN AS AN OBJECTIVE. AND ON THE RIGHT YOU'LL SEE A SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM WHAT WE CALL A SMART GOAL, SPECIFIC, MEASURABLE, ACTIONABLE, THOSE GOALS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE. THIS WILL GIVE US A FRAMEWORK THAT WE CAN LOOK AT WHERE THE COMMUNITY IS IN RELATION TO THE COUNCIL'S MANY PLANS AND POLICIES, DIRECTIONS, YOU'VE PROVIDED, AND HAVE A SNAPSHOT ON WHERE WE ARE IN OUR PATH TO SUCCESS. DOCUM WOULD LOOK AT OVER T NEXT WEEK IN IT PREPARATION -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE GOING TO CALL IT SINCE IT'S OVER ZOOM I GUESS IT USED TO BE THE OFFSITE. IT'S A RETREAT. BUT WE'LL TALK ABOUT THIS AT THAT TIME. SO, IF YOU COULD TAKE A LOOK THROUGH THAT I'LL BE PARTICULARLY INTERESTED TO UNDERSTAND FOR THE LONG-TERM TARGETS IF THERE ARE THINGS THAT YOU THINK SHOULD BE CHANGED, ADDED, OR DELETED FOR THE OBJECTIVES. THE OBJECTIVE COLUMN AND THE LONG-TERM REALERERERDW IF WE'VE CAPTURED WHAT SUCCESS WOULD LOOK LIKE FOR YOU AS A LONG-TERM TARGET. AND THIS HAS BEEN REALLY PULLED TOGETHER BY A NUMBER OF STAFF MEMBERS TO TRY TO GET IT READY FOR YOU. SO WITH THAT IN MIND, THAT'S THE INFORMATION I WANTED TO COVER. THAT'S ALL I'VE GOT RIGHT NOW, MAYOR. THANK YOU.
00:16:27.654: >> Mayor Taylor:  EXCELLENT. THANK YOU. WELL, WE HAVE A COUPLE OF INTRODUCTIONS THE FIRST, A PROCLAMATION HONORING CYNTHIA WILL MS. BEAUDRY, CAN Y SUBMIT MS. WILLBANKS OVER TO THE ZOOM?

00:21:13.106: >> THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE IT. I HAVE THE PLAQUE IN FRONT OF ME NOW.
00:21:19.712: >> Mayor Taylor:  OH, GOOD.
00:21:21.948: >> SO I KNOW THAT THE WORK OF A LOT OF ELVES HELPED TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN. SO I APPRECIATE BOTH THE SENTIMENTS AND THE OPPORTUNITY, ACTUALLY, TO BE WIT YOU TONIGHT. I'M HONORED ACTUALLY BY THE RECOGNITION. ANI' JTAY A FEW BRIEF WORDS AND THEN LET YOU GET ON WITH THE COUNCIL'S IMPORTANT WORK. I REALLY DO APPRECIATE THIS HONOR. I WILL TELL YOU THAT AFTER 25 YEARS OF WORKING AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN I CAN VERY CLEARLY AND WITHOUT ANY HESITATION SAY IT HAS BEEN ONE OF THE GRAND JOURNEYS OF MY CAREER. THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK AT AN INSTITUTION I LOVE, SIDBY-SIDE TH SO MANY BOTH AT THE INSTITUTION AND IN THE COMMUNITY WHO APPRECIATE THE IMPORTANCE OF RELATIONSHIPS IS FUNDAMENTAL TO THE WORK THAT I HAVE TRIED TO DO ON BEHALF OF THE UNIVERSITY IN A GOVERNMENT RELATIONS ROLE. A NUMBER OF YOU KNOW, JIM CASTIVA, WHO HAS SERVED AS OUR DIRECTOR OF COMMUNITY RELATIONS FOR MANY, MANY YEARS, JIM HAD HIS OWN RETIREMENT SEVERAL YEARS AGO, BUT JIM AND I STARTED AT THE UNIVERSITY JUST AB ABOUTT TH WE CAMNIVERSITY A A PERIOD WRE TOWN GOWN RELATIONS COULD BE DESCRIBED AS CHALLENGING. I'LL JUST USE THAT WORD. HE AND I BOTH VERY QUICKLY CAME TO AGREE, AND IT DIDN'T TAKE ANY AMOUNT OF TIME, REALLY, THAT WE BOTH NEEDED TO DEDICATE OURSELVES AND OUR EFFORTS TO MAKING ADJUSTMENTS WHERE WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE IN THERE BOT AND THE CITY TO DO SO. SOME OF YOU WILL REMEMBER ONE OF HIS -- OR I'LL CALL THEM ORIGINAL THINGS -- I'M NOT SURE IF HE CRIB IT FROM SOMEONE ELSE, BUT HE FREQUENTLY LIKED TO SAY THAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE UNIVERSITY AND THE CITY IS LIKE A MARRIAGE, EXCEPT DIVORCE IS NOT AN OPTION. SO, DURING THE COURSE OF A RELATIONSHIP WHERE DIVORCE IS NOT A OPTION, SOMETIMES YOU'RE COMPLETELY IN SYNC, SOMETIMES YONEITTL HEL SOMETIMES YOU NEED A LITTLE MEDIATION, A SOMETIMES YOU JUST NEED A LITTLE SPACE. AND ALL OF THOSE FEATURES ARE REALLY PART OF WHAT CREATES A RELATIONSHIP OF MUTUAL RESPECT AND A RELATIONSHIP WHERE YOU CAN FORGE NEW OPPORTUNITIES TO BE SUCCESSFUL BOTH FROM THE CITY'S PERSPECTIVE, UNIVERSITY'S PERSPECTIVE, BUT REALLY QUITE IMPORTANTLY NOT SEPARATE CCESSES IN MANY WAYS BUT SUCCSES WHERE WE CANOT AIM, LEGITIMATELY CLAIM, SHOULD SAY OPPORTUNITIESO BE SUCCESUL TOGETR. AND THAT HAS TRULY BEEN PT OF MY GOA AND EVEN ON THOSE DS WHERE THERE'S A LITTL BIT MEF A FFERENCE OF A VIEW, THEY DON'T LAST LONG AND WE COMMIT OURSELVES. I SINCERELY MEAN THIS, COMMIT OURSELVES IN WAYS THAT I THINK ARE NOT AS ENTIRELY UNDERSTOOD BY THE PUBLIC TO CONTINUE TO PERSIST IN FINDING SOLUTIONS, FINDG G YS WORKETHER SUPPORT OF A COMMUNITY THAT IS EXCEEDINGLY IMPORTANT TO THE WELL-BEING OF THE UNIVERSITY AND CERTAINLY VERY, VERY IMPORTANT TO THE LONG-TERM SUCCESS OF THE UNIVERSITY AND THE COMMUNITY TOGETHER. SO THAT HAS BEEN THE WAY I'VE APPROACHED THIS WORK, THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH THREE MAYORS OF THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR IN MY OFFICIAL CAPACITY AND KNOWING MOST OF THE MAYORS GOING ALL THE WAY BACKO BELCHER, AS A MATTER OF FACT, WAY BACK EN, HAS BEEN A TERRIFIC OPPORTUNITY TO UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE THE REAL CHALLENGES OF CITY GOVERNMENT AND OPPORTUNITIES AT THE UNIVERSITY TO FIND WAYS THAT WE CAN WORK TOGETHER. STEVE IS SOMEONE I'VE KNOWN FOR A LONG, LONG TIME. I CAN REMEMBER COUNSELING STEVE ON MANY OCCASIONS ON ONE ISSUE OR ANOTHER. I'M THRILLED TO SEE TOM CRAWFORD NOW SERVING AS THE CITY RATO A LOT OF RESPECT FOR AND THINK THAT YOU'VE MADE A GOOD CICE IN SELECTING TOM. I SEE FIVE NEW BOARD MEMBERS, NEW COUNCIL MEMBERS HERE. TO EACH OF YOU, GOOD LUCK. YOU'RE STARTING YOUR JOURNEY AND SERVICE TO THE CITY AT A PRETTY CHALLENGING TIME. FOR THE FIVE BOARD MEMBERS WHO ARE CONTINUING THEIR SERVICE, THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN DOING AND ARE CONTINUING TO DO AND DEVOTING YOURSELVES TO DO ON BEHALF OF THE CITIZENS OF ANN ARBOR AND CERTAINLY THAT INCLUDES THE COLLEAGUES THAT ARE UNIVERSITY ON SO MANY DIMENSIONS OF OUR RELATIONSHIP. SO MR. MAYOR, IT'S BEEN A TERRIFIC RELATIONSHIP. I LOOK FORWARD TO OUR PATHS CROSSING WITH ALL OF YOURS IN THE FUTURE. AND CERTAINLY I'LL BE SITTING AT A DIFFERENT PERCH. AND MIKE REIGN, WHO IS ABLY DOING THE WORK OF THE DIRECTOR OF COMMUNITY RELATIONS WILL BE EVER PRESENT. POLICE CONSIDER HIMO- AS T TRANSITIO TAKES PLACE IN THE NEXT SEVERAL WEEKS. ALL OF YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU FOR THE SERVICE THAT YOU GIVE. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. I WORRY SOMETIMES THAT IT'S UNDERAPPRECIATED, EVEN IN THE TIMES THAT ARE MOST CHALLENGING. IT CAN BE UNDERAPPRECIATED BUT KNOW FROM ME THAT I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THE BALANCING ACT THAT WE ALL HAVE TO DO IN ORDER TO ADVANCE OUR RESPECTIVE AND IMPORTANT ROLES SEPARATELY AND WORKING TOGETHER. SOHA. GEN OF ALL. I APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU.
00:27:34.520: >> Mayor Taylor:  THANK YOU SO MUCH. A PLEASURE HAVING YOU HERE TODAY.
00:27:38.391: >> THANK YOU.
00:27:45.765: >> Mayor Taylor:  WE NOW HAVE A REPORT THAT WE HAVE OUR SECOND INTRODUCTION, A REPORT FROM DR. JACKSON, THE CHAIR OF THE INDEPENDENT COMMUNITY POLICE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION FOR A MONTHLY UPDATE.
00:27:57.677: >> GOOD EVENING. CHAIR JAC HANK Y I'M LISA JACKSON, CHAIR OF THE INDEPENDENT COMMUNITY POLICE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION. FIRST I'D LIKE TO EXTEND A SPECIAL APPEAL H WILL HELLO TO OUR NEW COUNCIL MEMBERS. THIS IS MY FIRST TIME ADDRESSING YOU HERE. OUR COMMISSION IS CERTAINLY EAGER TO TALK WITH YOU AND HAVE YOU ATTEND OUR MEETINGS AND LEARN ABOUT OUR PROCESSES. I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AND GETTING TO KNOW EACH OF YOU A BIT BETTER IN THE NEAR FUTURE. BEFORE I GET INTO MY MAIN POINT FOAY, I LIKE TO SAY SOME WOULD SAY I DON'T SAY OFTEN ENOUGH, WHICH IS THAT IT IS CLEAR TO ME AND TO MOST PEOPLE THAT MOST PEOPLE IN ANN ARBOR AGREE THAT THE ANN ARBOR POLICE DEPARTMENT IS GOOD AT WHAT WE USUALLY THINK OF AS THEIR MAIN JOB, KEEPING US SAFE. SO I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND WHEN I GET PUSHBACK FROM THE POLICE DEPARTMENT WHEN I CRITICIZE THE WAY SOMETHING HAS BEEN HANDLED. BECAUSE THE BULK OF WHAT THEY DO REALLY IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR ENOUGH PEOPLE. IT FEELS RIDICULOUS, I'M SE,HEME THE OUTSIDE AND SAY THAT THEIR WORK HAS BEEN INSUFCIENT IN ANY WAY. HOWEVER, THE SMALLER PERCENTAGE OF THINGS THAT THEY DON'T DO AS WELL ARE ALSO IMPORTANT. AND, IN FACT, THAT'S WHY CITIZEN OVERSIGHT IS SO NECESSARY. IT'S CLEAR, ADDRESSING THE WAY THE OFFICERS INTERACT WITH LAW-ABIDING CITIZENS WHO AREN'T COMMITTING CRIMES REQUIRES AN ADDITIONAL SET OF TOOLS THAN THOSE THAT ARE USED TO KEEP US SAFE. POLICE OFFICERS WHO ARE SWORN TO PROTECT AND SERVE NEED BOTH. OF THOSE KINDS OF TOOLS. ANDHISNITY, I'VE EVEN THEAYOR A COUNCIL EXPRESS THIS THERE'S A HIGH EXPECTATION FOR UNBIASED POLICING. THAT DOESN'T JUST MEAN IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL VIOLENCE THAT ALSO EXTENDS TO REGULAR INTERACTIONS WITH CITIZENS. SO IT'S OUR JOB AS AN OVERSIGHT BODY TO REMIND THE POLICE AND THIS COUNCIL AND TO REAFFIRM TO THE COMMUNITY THAT GOOD ENOUGH ISN'T ACTUALLY GOOD ENOUGH. EVEN THOUGH POLICING IS ALREADY GOOD HERE, OUR CITY PRIDES ITSELF ON BEING EXCEPTIONAL. SO THIS CAN'T BE A PLACE WHERE WE SETTLE FOR GOOD ENOUGH. AND THIS IS WHAT I HEAR OVER AND OVER WHENO OUT INTO TH COMMUNITD T TO PEOPLE ABOUT THEIR INTERACTIONS WITH THE POLICE. THE CONVERSATIONS AREN'T DID CONDEMNING THE POLICE OR SAYING THAT THEY ARE TO BLAME FOR THE STATE OF THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COMMUNITY. IT'S ABOUT THE LITTLE THINGS. IT'S ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS AT THE MARGINS. AND IT'S WHY THE MARGINS MATTER. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT MARGINS, WE'RE USUALLY TALKING ABOUT A DIFFERENCE IN NUMBERS, MARGINAL GROWTH, A MARGIN OF VICTORY. AND THESE KINDS OF MARGINS ARE IMPORTANT WHEN IT COMES TO THE POLICE AS WELL, SUCH AS WHEN WE ANALYZE VIOLENT CRIME RATES OR TRAFFIC STOP DATA. BUT S ANOTHER USE OF THE RGIN THAT IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT. WHAT I'M TALNG ABOUT IS WHAT HAPPENS AT THE MARGINS THIS INCLUDES NOT ONLY MARGINAL DATA BUT ALSO THE PEOPLE WHO OFTEN MAKE UP THE MARGINS OF OUR COMMUNITY. SO I'D LIKE TO INVITE YOU TO LISTEN TO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED AT THE MARGINS. AND YOU GUYS -- I KNOW SOME OF YOU HAVE PROBABLY HEARD SEVERAL TIMES ABOUT THE BLOCK PARTY A WHILE BACK WHERE FRIENDLY POLICE OFFICERS WESTBOUND INTER-- WERE INTERACTING WITH THE COMMUNITY, ENTERTAINING THE KIDS. AT ONE POINT THEY BEGAN HANDCUFFING KIDS FOR FUN, WHICH THE KIDS ENJOE JOYED..T IT WAS K PARENTS WERE NOT ALLOWING THEIR CHILDREN TO PTICIPATE. IT WAS OBLIVIOUS TO THE POLICE OFFICERS, THOUGH THAT THEIR ACTIVITY WOULDN'T BE PERCEIVED AS FOND BY BLACK PARENTS. THAT, HIGHLY EDUCATED AND HIGH SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS, THOUGH THEY MAY BE UNDERSTAND THAT THE POSSIBILITY OF OUR CHILDREN BEING HANDCUFFED DESERVEDLY SO OR NOT IS NOT ANYTHING TO BE SIMULATED. NOW, THERE WAS NO MALICE ON THE PART OF THESE POLICE OFFICERS. BUT IT DOES INDICATE SOME NEED FOR EDUCATION ONBEHAS ARECEIVEDY EVERYONE IN THE COMMUNITY, NOT SENSITIVITY TRAINING, JUST AN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW BIAS WORKS AND HOW POLICING CAN LOOK IF YOU'RE ON THE MARGINS. ANOTHER AREA TO LOOK AT IS POLICE RUDENESS ABOUT 50% POLICE COMPLAINTS ARE ABOUT RUDE BEHAVIOR. I KNOW THAT MIGHT NOT SOUND LIKE SOMETHING WE SHOULD MAKE A BIG DEAL ABOUT BUT IT DOES MATTER. IT TURNS OUT TO BE ONE OF THE LARGEST FACTORS IN PUBLIC TRUST. HERE'S AN EXAMPLE. WE RECENTLY RECEIVED A COMPLAINT AFTER AN INCIDENT WHERE A WOMAN'S TEENAGED DAUGHTER WAS INVOLVED IN AIDENT D THE MOM DROVE TO THE SCENE TO MAKE SURE HER DAUGHTER WAS OK AND SHE WROTE IN HER COMPLAINT THAT ONE OF THE OFFICERS PRESENT YELLED AT HER. AND WHEN WE REVIEWED THE BODYCAM FOOTAGE, IT TURNED OUT THE OFFICER HADN'T ACTUALLY YELLED AT HER BUT HE WAS DISMISSIVE AND HE WAS IMPATIENT AND HE WAS BEFORE USK. HE ASKED THIS MOM WHY SHE WAS EVEN THERE AFTER SHE DROVE TO THE SCENE TO O MAKE SURE HER DAUGHTER WAS OK. THE PROBLEM WITH THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR ISN'T JUST THAT IT'S UNHELPFUL BUT IT'S A PROBLEM BECAUSE IT C TLLEOPLE THATHE POO YOU UNLES THEY SEE THE INTERACTION AS PART OF THEIR JOB. IT ALMOST SEEMED AS IF THIS MOTHER WAS INCONVENIENCING THE OFFICER. AND THE THING IS, MAKING PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY CAN TURN TO THE POLICE WHEN THINGS ARE UNCERTAIN IS A PART OF PUBLIC SAFETY. UNFORTUNATELY WHEN THE POLICE FEEL LIKE THEY'RE ALLOWED TO BE RUDE TO PEOPLE WHAT TRUST EXISTS BETWEEN THEM AND THE COMMUNITY IS EVEN FURTHER ERODED. WE HAD ANOTHER INCIDENT WHERE A BLACK WOMAN DOING YOGA WAS APPROACHED BY TWO WHITE OFFICERS LOOKING TO ASK QUEST ABOUT  HOMELESS PEOPLE IN THE AREA. AND THE WOM REPORTED TO US THAT SHE FELT INTIMIDATED BY THE OFFICERS AND SHE WAS AFRAID DURING THE INTERACTION AND THAT SHE'S NOW FEARFUL TO EXERCISE OUTSIDE. WHEN THE OFFICERS THEN APPROACHED A NEARBY FAMILY, ALSO ASKING ABOUT HOMELESS PEOPLE, THE FAMILY STATED THAT THEY HAD OBSERVED THE INTERACTION WITH THE BLACK WOMAN AND THAT THEIR CHILDREN HAD EXPRESSED CONCERN OVER THE POLICE OFFICER'S DECISION TO APPROACH THAT WOMAN ALONE, AND THEY EXPRESSED CONCERN FOR HER SAFETY. THTHFI BALKED AT THE DAD'S SUGGESTION THAT THEY HAD BEENN ANY WAY THREATENING OR INTIMIDATING TO HER. SO WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE A WOMAN FEELS THREATENED BY THE POLICE. ANOTHER FAMILY UNRELATED TO HER OBSERVES THE SITUATION. AND THEY EXPRESS CONCERN OVER THE WAY THE POLICE HANDLE THINGS, ONLY TO HAVE THE OFFICERS DENY ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SITUATION. THAT'S A PROBLEM. AND AS A FAMILY WROTE IN AN E-MAIL TO THE MAYOR, WHICH HE KINDLY SHARED WITH US AT THEIR REQUEST, THEY SAID, QUOTE, WE FIND SUC IGNORAN UNACCEPTABLE. IFHE OICS TRULY DO NOT RECOGNIZE HOW THEIR OFFICERS CAN BE INTIMIDATING AND THREATENING TO BLACK CITIZENS, THEN OUR CITY HAS A LOT OF WORK TO DO AROUND HE HAD INDICATION OF THE POLICE FORCE. -- EDUCATION OF THE POLICE FORCE. ALTERNATIVELY, IF THE OFFICERS DO RECOGNIZE WHAT IT COULD BE A PROBLEM BUT STILL CONTRIVE A THREATENING ACTION WHEN ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE SUCH AS APPROACHING OUR GROUP RATHER THAN A WOMAN BY HERSELF, THEN OUR CITY HAS A LOT OF WORK TO DO AROUND THE JUDGMENT AND DECISION MAKING OF POLICE OFFICERS. AND TO BE REALLY REAL FOR A MONT,NOW THIS IS A CULTURAL PROBLEM THAT EXTENDS BEYOND THE ATTITUDES OF INDIVIDUAL OFFICERS. WHEN WE SPOKE WITH POLICE LEADERSHIP ABOUT THIS INCIDENT, THEY DOWNPLAYED ITS SEVERITY. IT'S PROBLEMATIC THAT ANYONE, LET ALONE POLICE LEADERSHIP, WOULD TRY TO RATIONALIZE THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR WHEN IT'S CLEAR THAT THE OUTCOME IS DECREASED TRUST IN THE OFFICERS THAT SERVE OUR COMMUNITY. AND WHEN I HAVE SPOKEN ABOUT THESE ISSUES BEFORE I OFTEN GET PUSHBACK THAT THESE ISSUES ONLY AFFECT A SUBSET OF PEOPLE. SO WE WOULD BE BETTERD AS BIGGER ISSUES.HEY PERCEIVE BUT HERE'S MY QUESTION YOU. IF JUSTICE AND EQUITY FOR EVERYONE IF THESE ARE OUR VALUES AS A COMMUNITY, SHOULDN'T WE FIGHT FOR THEM REGARDLESS OF HOW MANY PEOPLE THEY AFFECT? EACH TIME I'VE COME BEFORE THIS COUNCIL I'VE TRIED TO IMPRESS UPON YOU THE IMPORTANCE OF PROCESS OF OVERSIGHT, OF ALLOWING US SEE POLICE NAMES, OF MAKING THE POLICE ACTIVITIES TRANSPARENT, OF HOLDING THE POLICE ACCOUNTABLE. AND WHILE I DIDN'T TALKUTTHE THR U TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE REASON WHY I TALK ABOUT THEM OVER AND OVER AND OVER IS BECAUSE THAT'S HOW WE TRANSFORM THE VISION OF OUR VALUES INTO A TANGIBLE REALITY FOR OUR COMMUNITY. I KNOW CREATING CHANGE IS HARD BUT I URGEOU CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR OUR COMMUNITY WHETHER IT'S FOR SWPING REFORM OR THANK YOU.TS AT THE MARGINS. Mayoraylor:  THA YOU RY MUCH, DR.

00:37:59.344: >> Clerk Beaudry:  CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING 736. MS. DUCKWORTH?
00:38:15.394: >> HELLO. THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH. CAN YOU HEAR NECESSITY? -- HEAR ME?
00:38:20.465: >> Clerk Beaudry:  YES GO AHEAD.
00:38:22.467: >> OK. THANK YOU. I JUST WANTED TO CALL AND FIRST SPEAK WITH YOU ABOUT THE RESOLUTION TO RECOGNIZE THE MICHIGAN THEATER FOUNDATION OF ANN ARBOR HAS A CIVIC NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION FOR GAMING LICENSE PURPOSES. I THINK RIGHT NOW ALL BUSINESSES ARE TAKING A HPECIALLY WITH THET WORK THA THIS THEATER HAS DONE, I THINK THAT THIS WOULD HELP THEM TO BUILD A REVENUE TO SUSTAIN DURING THIS COVID CRISIS. ALSO, I WANT TO SAY A CONGRATULATIONS AND A WELCOME TO ALL THE NEW CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS. WE ARE EXCITED TO HAVE THEM AND TO WORK WITH EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THEM. WE ARE ABSOLUTELY THRILLED ABOUT THIS. I ALSO JUST WANTED TO SPEAK VERY BRIEFLY ABOUT THE PRIVILEGE OF MEMBERS.OUR CITY COUNCIL I WAS VERY DISHEARTENED T SEE THAT JEFF HAYNER THOUGHT IT WAS OK TO ADD A SECOND ADDITION ON HIS HOME AND NOT HAVE A PERMIT. I, AGAIN, FEEL LIKE MR. HAYNER DOES NOT UNDERSTAND THAT HE CANNOT JUST DO WHAT HE WANTS TO DO. FOR ME, WHEN MR. HAYNER CAME FOR COUNCILWOMAN AYER THE WAY HE DID WITH SUCH DISRESPECT AND BEING VERY DEMEANING A ME, MR. HAYNER SHOULD HAVE EXCUSED HIMSELF FROM THE BOARD -- FROM CITY COUNCIL. SO WE ARE ASKING THAT MR. HAYNER DO WHAT'S RIGHT AND RESIGN FROM CITY COUNCIL NOT ONLY THAT WE'RE ASKING THIS BUT WE ARE ASKING OTHER CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS TO REQUEST AND DEMAND THAT HAYNER ALSO RESIGN FROM CITY COUNCIL. HE SHOWS THAT HE WILL DO WHAT HE WANTS TO DO. AND IN THIS POSITION, THIS IS A POSITION OF THE PEOPLE. THE PEOPLE HAVE PLACED NEW THIS POSITION. THEY HAVE THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF INTEGRITY. YOU C THAT MANNER, THEN IT'S QUITE UNFORTUNATE BUT DO NOT DESERVE THAT SEAT. AND I ALSO THINK IT'S DISHEARTENING FOR COUNCILWOMAN NELSON TO TAKE UP FOR YOU AND SAY, OH, BUT HE JUST COULDN'T AFFORD IT. THIS FROM SOMEONE WHO THOUGHT IT WAS OK BEFORE SHE KISSED THE COUNCIL'S FEET TO GIVE HER NEIGHBORS A LETTERHEAD FROM THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR TO JOKE WITH THEM. WELL, AGAIN, IT LOOKS LIKE SHE ALWAYS WANTS TO JOKE. SHE THOUGHT IT WAS A JOKE TO CAUSE LOWER --
00:40:55.220: >> Clerk Beaudry: SECONDS.
00:40:56.354: >> WE FEEL THESE TWO BOARD MEMBERS NEED TO PLACE THEIR PRIVILEGE IN CHECK. WE ASK THIS COUNCIL AND THE MAYOR TO STAND WITH US AND REQUEST THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS BOTH RESIGN BUT EXPRESSLY HAYNER BECAUSE HE DOES NOT DESERVE THIS SEAT ALONG WITH MISS AYER WHOM HE HAS DISRESPECTED GREATLY. THANK YOU.
00:41:18.610: >> Mayor Taylor:  THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS MARILYN.
00:41:28.987: >> Clerk Beaudry:  CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING IN 364. YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND SPEAK. [NO AUDIBLE RESPONSE] CALLER, 364, IF YOU PRESS STAR 6, YOU CAN UNMUTE YOURSELF.
00:41:55.480: >> THU. GOOD EVENING. I'M FROM ANN ARBOR, WARD 2. I AM A RETIRED SOCIAL WORK PROFESSOR FROM EASTERN MICHIGAN UNIVERSITY WITH A SPECIALTY IN MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. IN ADDITION, I HAVE LIVED EXPERIENCE WITH BIPOLAR DISORDER THAT IS NOW WELL MANAGED. I AM HERE TONIGHT AS A MEMBER OF CITIZENS FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND PUBLIC SAFETY, AN ADVOCACY GROUP TO ENSURE THAT THE 2017 MILLAGE IS SPENTNTIRELY ON THE ISSUESATD THOUGHT THEY WERE RECEIVING; NAMELY, MENTAL HEALTH AND PUBLIC SAFETY. WHAT OTHER URGENT NEEDS THE MILLAGE MONEY COULD STILL ADDRESS THIS EVENING AND FOCUSING ON THREE URGENT NEEDS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN COVERED BY THE MILLAGE FUND AND COULD BE. NUMBER ONE, EVIDENCE-BASED EARLY INTERVENTIONS TO HELP PREVENT MENTAL ILLNESS FROM BECOMING FULL-BLOWN. THESE INTERVENTIONS OFTEN TAKE PLACE DURING ADOLESCENCE AND INVOLVE EARLY MEDICATIONS AT LOW DOSES, FAMILY SUPPORT AND EDUCATION, AND SCHOOL AND WORK INTERVENTIONS SECONDLY WOULD BE THE EXPANSION OF ACT OR ASSERTIVE COMMUNITY TREATMENT, THAT IS ALREADY AVAILABLE WITH OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH FOR THE MOST SEVERE CASES. THIS HOME-BASED TEAM MODEL COULD BE EXPANDED TO INCLUDE A WIDER RANGE OF CMH CLIENTS WHERE THERE IS RESEARCH EVIDENCE THAT POINTS TO THEACY OF THIS INTERVENTION WITH A WHOLE RANGE OF PERSO WITH MENTAL ILLNESS. THE THIRD URGENT NEED WOULD BE TO PROVIDE SPECIFIC TRAINING TO THE ANN ARBOR POLICE AND SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT IN WORKING WITH PERSONS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS. THE LACK OF TRAINING IN THIS AREA CAN RESULT IN OVERREACTIONS ON THE PART OF POLICE TO A MENTAL HEALTH CLIENT OR A PERSON THEY ENCOUNTER WITH MENTAL HEALTH SYMPTOMS. TO US IT IS QUITE OBVIOUS THAT THESE ARE URGENT NEEDS THAT MUST BE ADDRESSED WITH TH REMAINING MILLAGE FUND RATHER THAN REALLOCATING MILLAGE FUNDS TO OTHER UNRELATED PROJECTS. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR FURTHER FUNDS FROM THE CITY COUNCIL'S BUDGET BUT, RATHER, THE APPLICATION OF FUNDS TO THE NEEDS OF THOSE IN OUR COMMUNITY WITH A MENTAL ILLNESS.
00:44:30.969: >> Clerk Beaudry:  30 SECONDS.
00:44:31.803: >> THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THIS MATTER.
00:44:40.645: >> Mayor Taylo  THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER.
00:44:54.258: >> Clerk Beaudry:  CALL WE ARE THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING IN 805, YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND SPEAK. [NO AUDIBLE RESPONSE]
00:45:16.581: >> Clerk Beaudry:  CALLER 805. IF YOU UNMUTE YOUR PHONE, YOU CAN GO AHEAD.
00:45:23.254: >> THANK YOU. GREETINGS TO ALL. AND CONGRATULATIONS TO THE NEWLY ELECTED MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL. MY NAME IS BARBARA HIGMAN, A MEMBER OF CITIZENS FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND PUBLIC SAFETY, LONG-TIME RESIDENT OF ANN ARBOR, AND THE OFFICE MANAGER OF NAMI, NATI SERVE ON THE MENTAL HEALTH BOARD AND I AM A PERSON W PPENS TO LIVE IN RECOVERY FROM A SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS. I APPLAUD THE COUNCIL OF THE ANN ARBOR LIVING CASHON NEUTRALITY PLAN AND AM A SUPPORTER OF CLIMATE CHANGE ACTION BUT NOT AT THE EXPENSE OF MENTAL HEALTH AND PUBLIC SAFETY. I'D LIKE -- UNLIKE POLIO AIDS, MENTAL ILLNESS IS A TRAGIC PANDEMIC WITH US FOR HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF YEARS. EFFORTS TO DEVELOP IMPLEMENTEFFT TIS HARMFUL AS IN THE CE OF SHOCK TREATMENT IN THE 30'S. PROGRESS HAS BEEN SLUGGISH TO SAY THE LEAST. ONE PSYCHIATRIST SAID WE MAY LOOK BACK AT THE MEDICATIONS IN USE TODAY AND WONDER HOW QUO HAVE BEEN SO BARBARIC. PERHAPS IT WAS BECAUSE OF PERSISTING MISTAKEN BELIEF THAT MENTAL ILLNESS IS A CHARACTER FLAW OR THE RESULT OF COLD MOTHERING. RELEGATED TO AN UNIMPORTANT O POWERLCIETY BY THE [INDCERNIBLE], PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS CONTINUE TO BE STIGMATIZED, DISCRIMINATED AGAINST, OWE PROSED, AND AFRAID TO DISCLOSE THEIR ILLNESS FOR FEAR OF BEING DIMINISH ORDER LOSING THEIR PERSONHOOD. 10 YEARS AFTER THE PASSAGE OF JOHN F. KENNEDY'S MENTAL HEALTH CENTER'S CONSTRUCTION ACT I WAS SENT TO A SMALL PRIVATE HOSPITAL TO A STATE INSTITUTION FOR THE MENTALLY ILL. I WAS DISCHARGED, EVENTUALLY ENDING UP ON THE STREETS I IEMEMR A KIND WOMAN SIT DOWNING WITH ME SOMEWHERE AND HELPING ME MAKE A LIST OF THE PROS AND CONS OF POSSIBLE FUTURE COURSES OF ACTION. PERHAPS SHE WALKED WITH ME TO THE YWCA WHERE I WAS ASKED FOR IDENTIFICATION. ALL I HAD WITH ME WAS A LETTER FROM MY MOTHER WHICH AMAZINGLY SUFFICED. I DO NOT REMEMBER WHAT TRANSPIRED LEADING UP TO MY SUBSEQUENT REINSTITUTIONALIZATION AT THE STATE HOSPITAL. ALMOST 50 YEARS LATER, NOT THAT MUCH HAS CHANGED IN HOW PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS TREATE EXCT PEOPLE ARE OVERWHELMINGLY SENT TOAIL INSTEAD OFTATE INSTITUTIONS.
00:47:58.877: >> Clerk Beaudry:  3 SECONDS.
00:48:04.182: >> ACTORS HELP THE COMMUNITY, FAMILIES, AFFLICTED INDIVIDUALS BY PROVIDING CARE AND TREATMENT REGARDLESS OF THE ABILITY TO P PAY. [INDISCERNIBLE] ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITIES TO PERSONS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS. AS YOU WORK ON THE BUDGET, I ASK YOU TO CAREFULLY CONSIDER WTYOUH SERVIC NOT JUST BECAU VOTERS CHOSE MENTAL HEALTH AND PUBLIC SAFETY BUTECAUSE IT IS THE ETHICAL AND MORALLY RIGHT THI TO DO. SOLET'S GET TOGETHER AND GET EDUCATEDO MAKE ANN ARB IGMA AND DISCRINATION-FREE ZONE BY026.
00:48:53.298: >> THANK Y.y TIME.
00:48:56.668: >> Mayor T YOU OUR NEXT SPEAKER.
00:49:06.244: >> Clerk Beaudry:  CALL WE ARE THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING IN 941 YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND SPEAK. MS. [INDISCELE], GAD. [NO AUDIBLE RESPONSE]
00:49:49.187: >> Clerk Beaudry:  CALLER 941, YOUR PHONE APPEARS TO BE UNMUTED BUT WE DON'T HEAR YOU.
00:50:18.683: >> Mayor Taylor:  ARE YOU ON THE LINE? DR. [INDISCERNIBLE], ARE YOU HERE?
00:50:43.775: >> CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW?
00:50:46.044: >> Mayor Taylor:  WE CAN HEAR YOU NOW.
00:50:48.946: >> HELLO? THANK YOU. OK. I'M GOING TO START MY THREE MINUTES NOW. GREETINGS, ANN ARBOR, AND CONGRATULATIONS FOR PUTTING A STOP TO DC3. MAYOR TAYLOR'S BIG MONEY SLATE HAS COME UP WITH DC3 AND THEY DON'T DOUBT THAT IT WAS PUBLIC PRESSURE THAT LED THEM TO WITHDRAW THIS DREADFUL PROPOSAL WHICH WOULD HAVE FAVORED [INDISCERNIBLE]. THE HUMILIATING CITY AGREEMENT, THE ONE THAT MAYOR TAYLOR WAS SO EXCITED ABOUT, WAS ALSO DITCHED BECAUSE THE PUBLIC DEMAND MEANINGFUL ACTION TO STOP THE SPREAD OF THE CONTAMINATION. ANN ARBOR C CITY COUNCIL HAS DRAGGED ITS FEET FOR DECADES WHILE [INDISCERNIBLE] HAS GOTTE. ALL THE WHILE [INDISCERNIBLE] HAS BEEN OOZING ACROSS THE CITY. ANN ARBOR CITY COUNCIL HAS BEEN HIJACKED BY BIG MONEY AND BILLIONAIRES OF THIS CITY, FORSAKING THE REST OF US, THE 1% HAS HIJACKED A POLITICAL SYSTEM AS THEY DO ELSEWHERE IN THIS COUNTRY WHICH ALLOWS THEM TO CARRY ON BUSINESS AS USUAL. WELL, BUSINESS AS USUAL DOES NOT WORK FOR THE REST OF US. CAN THE BILLIONAIRE CLASSR MEN R A CITY WHERE HALF OF I CITIZENS ARE RENTERS? I HARDLY THINK SO. CAN A CITY COUNCIL HIJACKED BY THE BILLIONAIRE CLASS CLEAN UP OUR WATER? 50 YEARS OF ANN ARBOR HISTORY SAYS NO, THEY WILL NOT CLEAN UP OUR WATERS. CAN A CITY COUNCIL HIJACKED BY THE BILLIONAIRE CLASS REMEDY OUR HOUSING SHORTAGE CRISIS? YEARS OF FAVORING LUXURY HOUSING PROJECTS SAYS NO, THEY CANNOT REMEDY OUR HOUSING CRISIS. A CIY THE BILLIONAIRE CLASS STOP THE RISING SEGREGATION IN OUR TOWN? NO, THEY CANNOT CAN A CITY COUNCIL HIJACKED BY BILLIONAIRE CLASS CARE ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS? NO, THEY CANNOT. FOR OVER 18 YEARS, WHILE THOUSANDS OF PALESTINIANS ARE TORTURED AND HAVE BEEN KILLED IN THE HANDS OF THE ISRAELI BUTCHERS, ANN ARBOR CITY COUNCIL AND ITS PHONY-BALONEY HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION VIOLENCED VOICE, ANYDEMANDING BOYCOTTF ISI APARTHEID STATES. ANN ARBOR CITY COUNCIL WHICH HAS, FOR DECADES, BEEN HIJACKED BY BIG MONEY INTERESTS --
00:53:27.471: >> Clerk Beaudry:  30 SECONDS.
00:53:29.740: >> ALLOWED THIS CONTAMINATION TO GROW TO THE LARGEST CONTAMINATION IN THE WORLD. STOP DRAGGING YOUR FEET AND CLEAN UP [INDISCERNIBLE] CONTAMINATION NOW. EPA SUPERFUND CLEANUP IS NO SOLUTION TO ANN ARBOR'S ENORMOUS CONTAMINATION WHICH YOU HAVE ALLOWED TO GET THIS BIG. WE M CLEAN I UP NOW BEFORE IT BECOMES IMPOSSIBLE TO CLEAN. STOP DRAGGING YOUR FEET AND CLEAN IT UP. WILL CLEAN UP ONCE AND FOR ALL. IF YOU DO NOT ACT --
00:54:02.440: >> Clerk Beaudry:  TIME.
00:54:03.674: >> IN THE INTEREST OF THE PUBLIC, WE WILL KICK YOU OUT AT THE ELECTION TIME.
00:54:09.313: >> Mayor Taylor:  THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER.
00:54:15.987: >> I ASSUME THE MIC IS STILL UNMUTED.
00:54:19.156: >> Mayor Taylor:  WE CAN HEAR YOU, SIR
00:54:23.394: >> OK. WELL, I'M GOING TO TALK. AM I STILL ON THE AIR?
00:54:27.732: >> Mayor Taylor:  YOU ARE ON THE AIR. AS FAR AS I CAN TELL, YOU'RE ON THE AIR.
00:54:32.003: >> ALL RIGHT. YOU KNOW, I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING THAT DR. [INDISCERNIBLE] SAID. AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT A CITY COUNCIL WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY RACIST IN ITS ORIENTATION WHICH REFUSES TO TAKE ANY ACTION TO PROTECT PALESTINIAN HUMAN RIGHTS ADDRESS WATE POLLUTION, T AFFORDABLE HOUSING, EDUCATION, OR ANYTHING, REALLY, THAT EFFECTS THE CITIZENS OF THE C CITY. I DON'T SEE HOW A CITY COUNCIL THAT IS THROWING ITS ENTIRE WEIGHT AGAINST A SIMPLE HUMAN RIGHTS MEASURE FOR THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE FOR SO MANY YEARS, I DON'T SEE HOW A CITY COUNCIL LIKE THAT IS REDEEMABLE. I DON'T SEE HOW IT CAN DO ANYTHING FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD. NOW, THE ANN CITY COUNCIL LIKES TO POSTURES IF IT CARES ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS, BUT WHEN IT MES TO ACTION, THE ONLY CONCRETE ACTION THAT STICKS OUT IN MY MIND THAT THEY TAKE IS TO THROW ALL OF THEIR WEIGHT, ALL OF THEIR WEIGHT, AGAINST HUMAN RIGHTS RESOLUTIONS THAT MIGHT PROTECT THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE. FOR EXAMPLE, THE RESOLUTION AGAINST MILITARY AID TO ISRAEL. WHY IS IT SO IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE CITY COUNCIL TO VOTE FOR IT? WHY IS IT SO IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE TY COUNCIL TO ALLOWPUBLIC HEARIS RESOLUTION? WHY IS IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR 18 YEARS FOR THE CITY COUNCIL TO ALLOW NO KIND OF PUBLIC HEARING FOR ANY SORT OF PALESTINIAN HUMAN RIGHTS RESOLUTION? OF COURSE THE ANSWER IS BLATANT RACISM AGAINST THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE, BLATANT RACISM AGAINST ARABS IN GENERAL. I CANNOT THINK OF ANY OTHER REASON WHY THE CITY COUNCIL WOULD ACT THAT WAY. AND  CITOUNCIL THAT IS RACIST IS RY GOOD FOR NOTHING THAT WOULD EVER HELP THE PUBLIC. THAT'S HOW I LOOK AT IT. THAT'S WHY I THINK THE CITY COUNCIL IS JUST DETERMINED NEVER TO CLEAN UP THE PLUME. THEY WILL CLAIM THAT THE EPA WILL DO IT ONE DAY IN 20, 30 YEARS. WELL, WE KNOW THAT'S NOT TRUE. THE EPA IS NOT GOING TO DO IT.
00:56:57.415: >> Clerk Beaudry:  30 SECONDS.
00:56:59.250: >> AND FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING, THE CITY YELLS THE WORDS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING A LOT. THE CITY COUNCIL THROWSITTLE CRUMBS OF HOUSING VOUCHERS AROUND. BUT AS FAR AS FRONTALLY ADDRESSING THE SCANDALIOUS HOUSING SHORTAGE, THE CITY COUNCIL REALLY DOES NOTHING. THEY KNOW THEY HAVE TO BUILD PUBLIC HOUSING AND THEY WON'T. SO AGAIN, A RACIST CITY COUNCIL GOOD FOR NOTHING. DON'T BE THAT KIND OF CITY COUNCIL.
00:57:32.983: >> Mayor Taylor:  THANK YOU OUR NEXT SPEAKER.
00:57:44.327: >> Clerk Beaudry: MR. FLOYD, PHONE ENDING 764. YOU CAN UNMUTE YOUR PHONE AND SPEAK. [NO AUDIBLE RESPONSE] YOU CAN UE YR PHO.PRESS STAR 6,
00:58:14.391: >> THE LAST FOUR OR FIVE YEARS HAVE NATIONALIZED PROBLEMS AND POLITICAL DISCOURSE THAT HAVE BEEN BUILDING LOCALLY HERE IN ANN ARBOR FOR YEARS. PERSONAL ATTACKS, THE VISIT REAL, UNREASONING ANGER, NAME CALL BEING ARE, CONNED SENSE, BEE LITTLING, BULLYING AND THREATS. OUR LO POLITAL YACHTHAS FOR OVEE RESEMBLED AN UNSUPVIDIDDLE HOOL LUNCH ROOM THAN A COMMUNITY OF INTELLECTUAL ADULTS OR EVEN A COMMUNITY OF EMOTIONAL ADULTS. NO WONDER THE INSTITUTIONS OF CIVIL SOCIETY SEEM UNDER ATTACK. THE BEHAVIORS THAT UNDERLIE CIVIL SOCIETY THAT MAKE IT POSSIBLE ARE FADING AWAY EVEN IN OUR SMALL MIDWESTERN TOWN. ANN ARBOR'S POLITICAL CLIMATE IS SO DAMAGED THAT AT TIMES I'VE ALMOST BEEN NUMB TO DONALD TRUMP. PERSONALLY I'M WEARY OF THAT CLIME. HE THEL NATIONALLY AND POSSIBLY THERE IS AN ABILITY FOR A NEW DAWN HERE. IN REFLECTING ON THIS, IT HAS STRUCK ME THAT THERE IS NO SOLUTION TO OUR DAMAGED POLITICAL CLIMATE THAT DOES NOT BEGIN WITH PEOPLE OWNING THEIR OWN STUFF AND TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR OWN OUTBURSTS OF PERSONAL ATTACK VITREAL AND CONNED SENSE. THAT THOUGHT LED KNOW ASK AS AN EVEN INFREQUENT SPEAKER HAVE I CONTRIBUTED IN A SMALL WAY TO DAMAGING OUR POLITICAL CLIMATE AND THE ANSWER IS YES H L AS A COUNCIL MEMB FEW WEEKS AGO, I MADE PERSONAL, ANGRY AREA CONDESCENDING REMARKS ABOUT MR. ACKERMAN AND HIS TENURE ON COUNCIL. I APOLOGIZE FOR SUBJECTING HIM, THIS BODY, AND ANY SPECTATORS FOR MY O OUTBURSTS. THIS IS A FORUM IN WHICH I MADE MY ATTACK AND SO IT SEEMED APPROPRIATE TO APOLOGIZE HERE AS WELL AS BY  LETTER TO MR. ACKERMAN. I TRUST THE MAYOR WILL KNOW THE PROPER FORWARDING ADDRESS. PASSIONS RUN HIGH WHEN IMPORTANT ISSUES ARE AT STAKE AND TRUST IS AY BE UEALISTIC TO EXPECT THAT NO ONE WILL EVER BOIL OVER WHEN THE STAKES ARE HIGH AND TRUST IS LOW. BUT OWNING OUR OWN BEHAVIOR, RECOGNIZING WHEN WE HAVE CROSSED THE LINE AND ACKNOWLEDGING THAT TO OTHERS CAN HELP PEOPLE FOCUS ON THE ISSUES AT HAND RATHER THAN ON PERSONALITIES THIS IS NARRATIVES, QUESTIONABLEFALSE DEALINGS AND POOR POLICY. FAR FROM IT. BUT IT I NO NOTE THAT HOW WE DO THINRS ANDOTE T CROSSED THE LINE MATTERS.
01:00:54.184: >> Clerk Beaudry:  30 SENDS Cle Beaudry:  MAYORR. FLOYD SE.
01:01:08.098: >> Mayor Taylor:  THANK YOU. ARE THERE COMMUNICATIONS TODAY FROM COUNCIL?
01:01:19.743: >> MR. FLOYD, YOU SET ME UP BEAUTIFULLY. I WOULD LIKE T SPEAK VERY BRIEFLY SO I FEEL WE'VE PUT THERE TO REST. I'D LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I MADE A MISTAKE LAST WEEK WITH A CARELESS REMARK THAT MADE IT SOUND AS IF I DID NOT WELCOME A FULL AND OPEN DISCUSSION OF THE CITY'S NEW TRANSPORTATION PLAN. I WANTED TO OFFER AN APOLOGY TO MY COLLEAGUES ON PLANNING COMMISSION WHICH I HOPE THEY'LL ACCEPT AND TO THE PUBLIC, PLEASE SET THAT FLIP COMMENT IN THE CONTEXT OF MY ACTIONS. MY WORK ETHIC, MY COUNCIL NEWSLETTER, AND OUR EXCHANGES OVER E-MAIL AND IN PERSON. THANK YOU
01:01:55.846: >> Mayor Taylor:  COU COUNCILMEMBER? COUNCILMEMBER I JUST WANTED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE RETIREMENT. FOR FOLKS WHO DON'T FOLLOW HER WORK, SHE'S BEEN WITH THE DDA FOR THE PAST 24 YEARS. WE WERE AT THE LAST MEETING. HEARD FROM FOLKS WHO WERE QUITE COMPLEMENTARY ABOUT HER WORK AND THE CONTRIBUTION THAT SHE'S MADE TO THE DOWNTOWN, ESPECIALLY DURING THE PANDEMIC, AND ESPECIALLY AS WE PREPARE ORT MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING WORK. I THINK IT'S WORTH NOTING, HER DEPARTURE. AND IF I CAN, I'D LIKE TO ALSO SHARE THE CHALLENGE THAT I SHARED OVER E-MAILS TO THE REST OF COUNCIL. I HAD ATTENDED THE RACE TO JUSTICE FORUM -- TOWN HALL THAT THE INTERFAITH COUNCIL FOR PEACE AND JUSTICE HAD HOSTED LAST WEEK. AND A LOT OF THAT WORK WAS REVIEWING KREUZ' REPORT PUBLISHED IN AUGUST, THE CITIZENS FOR RACIAL EQUITY O -- THE REPORT COVERS START WITH BLACK DEFENDANTS RECEIVING MORE CHARGES -- MORE THAN WHITES. SO, I THINK THAT REALLY SPEAKS TO DR. JACKSON'S COMMENTS ABOUT WHAT ARE THE EXPERIENCES OF FOLKS IN THE MARGINS. I ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO READ IT. YOU MIGHT HAVE ALREADY READ IT. I KNOW DR. JACKSON SENT IT TO COUNCIL EARLIER BEFORE SOME OF US CAME ON BOARD. BUT I ENCOURAGE IT. 50 PAGES. I  YOU CAN DO IT. THE LIBRARY IS HOSTING A CONVERSATION ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN STRUCTURAL RACISM AND MENTAL HEALTH IN OUR COMMU COMMUNITIES, THURSDAY DECEMBER 17, 7:00 P.M. THIS IS IN PARTER TEMPERATURE HAVE THE DEPRESSION CENTER. THEY'LL HAVE GUIDANCE FOR CITIZENS TO ENACT CHANGE. THAT'S AADL.TV. AND I ALSO WANTED TO REPORT OUT THAT I ATTEND A COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT SESSION FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN OUR PUBLI THERE'S ANHEOMING UP ON THE 14TH. I'M SORRY, A SURVEY PARTICIPATION DUE BY THE 14TH BUT WE HAVE A SESSION ON THE 10TH, 6:00 TO 8:00 P.M. I HAD A GREAT TIME. IT WAS GREAT TO ASK QUESTIONS OF STAFF AND SEE COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO FEEL PASSIONATELY ABOUT WHAT THE FUTURE WILL HOLD WITH THESE SITES FROM NEAR NEIGHBORS TO FOLKS ACROSS GENERATIONS, RENTERS. SO I ENCOURAGE FOLKS TO PARTICIPATE. I'VE JOKED THAT I HOPE I'M NOT SURVEY.Y ASIAN WOMAN IN THE LET'S GET MORE GRASSROOTS PARTICIPATION AS POSSIBLE. THANK YOU.
01:04:46.850: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
01:04:50.053: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANKS, MR. MAYOR. I WASN'T GOING TO GIVE VOICE TO THE FRAUDULENT CLAIMS LAST WEEK BUT SINCE A CALLER SAW FIT TO REPEAT THEM, ALSO THINGS THAT SOUND LIKE THEY MAY HAVE COME FROM SOCIAL MEDIA, I FEEL LIKE I SHOULD ADDRESS IT. AT NO TIME HAVE I -- I'VE NEVER BEEN FINED BY THE CITY. THERE'S NO WORK HAPPENING ON MY HOUSE ON PTTED HA ON MY HOUSE. MY UNFINISHED PROJECT IS NOWHERE NEAR TO THE REQUIREMENT OF BEING SUBSTANTIALLY FINISHED WHERE IT WOULD REQUIRE REASSESSMENT. THE CITY STAFF HAS BEEN MOST HELPFUL TO ME IN GETTING ME BACK INTO THE SYSTEM AND REAPPLYING FOR THE PERMITS THAT ARE NECESSARY. AND SO I WANT TO THANK THEM FOR THEIR FAIR AND EVEN TREATMENT OF ME AND EVERYONE, INDEED EVERYONE WHO INTERFACED WITH THAT DEPARTMENT. I FIND IT AURIOUS CLAIMTI'VE SOT PRIVILEGE AND THEN TURN AROUND AND DISCOUNT FACT THAT MY RELATIVE POVERTY IS WHAT STALLED MY PROJECT 10 YEARS AGO. IN THE LAST DECADE, MY FAMILY'S INCOME HAS BEEN AT OR BELOW 60% OF AMI. I QUALIFY FOR ASSISTIVE HOUSING IN THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. I'M NOT PROUD OF THAT, BUT I BELIEVE THAT I REPRESENT BY HAVING LIVED RELATIVE POVERTY SO CAN CALL FOR ME TO RESIGN. IT'S NOT GOING TAPPEN. IF YOU FEEL THAT  DON'T REPRESENT YOUR WARD WELL, THEN THERE ARE MECHANISMS BY WHICH YOU CAN TAKE ACTION. FEEL FREE TO TRY AND RECALL ME. I WILL NOT BE RESIGNING BECAUSE I SPEAK FOR THOSE OF US WHO DON'T GET A STEADY PAYCHECK FROM THE UNIVERSITY, WHO DON'T BILL HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS PER HOUR FOR THEIR WORK. I REPRESENT POVERTY. AND THERE'S MORE OF US OUT HERE THAN THIS COUNCIL MAKEUP MIGHT CONSIDER AND THAT MOST PEOPLE REAMUNDETO RECOGNIZE. I THINK WE ALL KNOW ONE IN FIVE KIDS IN OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS WHO IS ON A FREE LUNCH PROGRAM IS BUT ONE EXAMPLE. SO, YOU KNOW, I WON'T BE RESIGNING. THAT'S JUST AS FAR AS IT GOES. I REJECT THE CLAIMS THAT SOMETHING THAT DID NOT LAP 10 HAPPEN 10 YEARS IS AN ACT OF A SEATED COUNCIL PERSON. WE CAN ALL THINK MANY RECENT EXAMPLES OF THINGS THAT SEATED COUNCIL PEOPLE HAVE DONE, BEHAVIORS THAT IN MY OPINION ARE N FOR THEIR RESIGNING. I FIND THIS POLITICAL PRESSURE CURIOUS. I REJECT THE NOTION THAT SOMEHOW I HAVE EXERCISED SOME TYPE OF PRIVILEGE IN THIS SITUATION. I CERTAINLY HAVE NOT.
01:07:42.359: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD?
01:07:46.530: >> Councilman Griswold: YES. I'VE JOINED THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION WHICH HAS BEEN A REAL PLEASURE. REP OUT ON THEOR OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION, A LETTER WILL BE SENT TO COUNCIL FROM THE CHAIR OF THE COMMISSION REGARDING AN ORDINANCE REVISION TO CHAPTER 40, THE RECOMMENDATION IS THAT AN AD HOC COMMITTEE BE FORMED WITH A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION, THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION, AND THE DISABILITY COMMISSION AS WELL AS STAFF MEMBERS TO LOOK AT CHAPTER 40. I THINK THAT'S AN EXCELLENT I IDEA. SECOND ITEM I I WANT TO THANK ALL THE COMMUNITY ADVOCATES, THE EXRTS, AS WELL AS CONGRESSWOMAN DEBBIE DINGLE FOR THE ADVOCACY THAT OCCURRED REGARDING THE DC3. I THINK IT SHOWED HOW IMPORTANT WATER QUALITY IS IN THIS COMMUNITY AND HOW COMPLEX THE ISSUE IS. I KNOW THAT THE MAYOR USED THE TERM PARALLEL PROCESS BACK ON NOVEMBER 5. I THINK THAT WAS THE DATE WHEN WE WERE DISCUSSING THE RESOLUTIONAND IT'S CRITICALHAT E CONTIN TO USE EVERY RESOURCE AVAILABLE TO PUSH TO GET THIS DIOXENE PLUME CLEANED UP, REMEDIATED, WHATEVER WORD YOU WANT TO USE. AND THIS IS ACTUALLY PROVIDED AN OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE THE COLLABORATION BETWEEN OUR OTHER ELECTED OFFICIALS I KNOW THEY'VE A BETTER RELATIONSHIP NOW WITH THE ELECTED TRUSTEES AS WELL AS OUR COUNTY COMMISSIONERS. SO AGAIN,'DIKE TO ACE TBORATION AND TEAM WOR LASTLY, A [INDISCERNIBLE] OCCURRED LAST NIGHT. THERE WERE SIX MEMBERS PRESENTED. TWO ARTICLES RESULTED FROM THE DISCUSSION. I THINK IT WAS PRODUCTIVE. I PROPOSE THAT WE MOVE CAUCUS TO 6:00 P.M. RATHER THAN 7:00 P.M. IN THE FUTURE TO REDUCE ANY RISK OF OVERLAPPING WITH THE MAYOR'S FACEBOOK LIVE. IF ANYONE OBJECTS TO THAT, PLEASE CONTACT ME PERSONALLY. THANK YOU.oraylo COUNCILMEMBER?
01:10:06.203: >> ANKS. WANTED TO BRIEFLY TOUCH ON OUR PROCLAMATION HONORING CYNTHIA WILBANKS EARLIER SINCE THERE WASN'T AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO SPEAK AT THAT TIME. WHILE I HAVE NOT HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH HER LONG IN MY POSITION AS A COUNCIL MEMBER, OUR PATHS HAVE CROSSED IN MY WORK AT THE ALUMNI ASSOCIATION AND IN OTHER EFFORTS AROUND TOWN. SHE IS CERTAINLY AN INCREDIBLY WELL-RESPECTED AND COLLABORATIVE PARTNETHAT WHAVE HADTHE UNIVERSITY AND SEONE WHO I KNOW WILL HAVE -- WHOEVER HAS TO REPLACE HER WILL HAVE SOME REALLY BIG SHOES TO FILL. I AM GRATEFUL FOR HER WORK OVER THE YEARS EVEN THOUGH I HAVE NOT HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH HER AS CLOSELY IN THIS ROLE. I JUST WANT TO WISH HER WELL AND THANK HER FOR HER SERVICE AND COLLABORATION AS WELL. THANKS.
01:10:57.687: >> Mayor Taylor:  FURTHER COMMUNICATIONS FROM COUNCIL? [NO AUDIBLE RESPONSE] I'VE GOT A COUPLE OF THINGS TO TOUCH ON FIRST. I FORGET ACTUALL WHICH COUNCILMEMBER MENTIONED THIS. I'D LIKE TO ECHO MY GOOD WISHES TO MS. [INDISCERNIBLE] ON THE OCCASION OF HER RESIGNATION FROM THE -- AS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE DDA. OUR DOWNTOWN IS TO BE ENVIED. IT'S A JEWEL OF ANN ARBOR. IT BELONGS TO ALL OF US. BETTER TIMES THRIVING.IVERSE IN AND WHILE WE CAN'T LAY ALL OF THAT AT HER FEET AS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE DDA, WE CAN SAY THAT IT IS THROUGH THE LEADERSHIP -- THE DOWNTOWN DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY AND SHE, THEY ARE THE FOCAL POINT FOR DOWNTOWN ADVOCACY, FOCAL POINT FOR DOWNTOWN INFRASTRUCTURE AND IMPROVEMENT. AND THEY AND SHE HAD JUST DONE AMAZING WORK. SHE HAS ALWAYS D WITH ACE. SHE' BE MISSED. SHE'LL BE MISSED AND TRUSH TREA. THANK YOU. SPEAKING OF THAT, THIS IS A SEASON IN WHICH MANY OF US LIKE TO BUY TNGS FORURSELVES AND FOR OTHER. AS WE A KNOW, WE AR EXPERIENCINGERY DIFFICULT TIMES. MANY OF US INDIVIDUALLY ARE EXPERIENCING DIFFICULT TES. THATERVES THE YEARINESSES ARE DOING SO  WELL. THROUGH T A ARBORND, O URSE, IN THE DOWNTN. CONSIDERING RAING UP TIRE FOTHIS OR THE NEX I'DTH YEAR SUGGEST AND WANT TO EOURAGE FOS TOHOP LAL, EAT LOC. THIS IS TIME T SUPPORTACH I'D HOPE THAT A AOR MAK THAT KWN BYRTING BUNESST ME U THE FABRIC OF OUR TOWN. THANK YOU FOR THAT. I'D LIKE TO REQUEST CONFIRMATION FOR THE FOLLOWING APPOINTMENTS THAT WERE PRESENTED TO CITY COUNCIL AT THE NOVEMBER 16 REGULAR SESSION MEETING. TO THE BOARD OF REVIEW, WILLIAM BROGAN. BOARD OF REVIEW 2, ALICE OWINGS AND CURT ZELL. CITY PLANNING COMMISSION, SATURDAY DIRE YAY CLARKE, WONWOO LEE. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION, DRAIN THOMPSON. HISTORIC DISTRICTN, HANNAH EPPERSON ROBERT WHITE. TRANSPORTATION COMSSION, ARLI ARLIE, BALANCEDDER ARA. MISSION TO APPROVE? MOVED. SECONDED. I'M SORRY. WAS -- SECONDED BY? COUNCILMAN GRAND. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER? COUNCILMEMBER. Councilmember Hayner: QUALIFIES MANY OF YOU NEGOTIATION I'VE ALWAYS SORT OF PUSHED BACK ON THIS NOTION OF REAPPOINTMENTS. HAVING REAPPOINTMENTS ON HERE THAT HAS REALLY INCREDIBLE TO ME. WE'VE GOT SOMEBODY WHO SERVED 15 YEARS ALREADY ON A BOARD SEAT. BECAUSE OF THE STATE LAW THAT FORMS HISTORIC DISTRICT COMMISSION DOESN'T JIVE EXACTLY WITH OUR COUNCIL CHARTER WHICH WOULD NOT ALLOW A REAPPOINTMENT AT THIS POINT, THIS PERSON HAS BEEN REAPPOINTED TO SERVE AGAIN I THINK 18 YEARS IS A LONG TIME TO SERVE ON A BOARD. E HERE IN THENE THAT THERE'S NOT COMMUNITY THAT COULD SERVE ON THE HISTORIC DISTRT COMMIS COMMISSION. SO, I DON'T SUPPORT ONE OF THE APPOINTMENTS TO THE HISTORIC DISTRICT COMMISSION. CURRENTLY OUR PLANNING COMMISSION IS NOT WHAT COULD BE CONSIDERED A DIVISIVE BODY. AND MR. MAYOR, YOU'VE SPOKEN ABOUT TRYING TO REDUCE DIVISIVENESS ON THIS COMMISSION, ON THIS BODY AND ON OUR BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS, AS HAVE MEMBERS OF PUBLIC INCLUDING TONIGHT. THE TWO APPOINTMENTS TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION ARE WHAT I WOULD CALL AWAY FROM AVOIDING THE APPEARANCE OF A CONFLICT OF INTEREST. INDEED, ONE OF THEM IS QUITE A PARTISAN PLAYER IN OUR COMMUNITY ON SOCIAL MEDIA AT THE VERY LEAST AND IN THEIR DONATIONS TO FIVE OF OUR COUNCIL MEMBERS IN THE LAST ELECTION. PLANNING COMMISSION IS NOT A DIVISIVE BODY NOW BUT IT CAN BE IF THESE PARTISAN APPOINTMENTS CONTINUE. ONE OF THEM WORKS FOR AV ALN WHO RECEIVES MONEY FROM THE CITY AND AS I SAY DONATED TO CANDIDATES HERE, NOW SEATED COUNCIL MUCH AS YOU CAMPAIGN FOR THEM,E MR. MAYOR, THOSE FIVE FOLKS. AND HAS ALSO SORT OF A HISTORY ON SOCIAL MEDIA OF WHAT COULD BE POLITELY CALLED BULLYING AND HALVE TRUTHS AND TOTAL UNTRUTHS. SO, I DON'T THINK THAT'S AN APPROPRIATE SEAT FOR PLANNING COMMISSION. THE OTHER PERSON HAD THE COURTESY TO PUT IN THEIR APPLICATION THAT THEY WORK FOR OXFORD IT SEEMS AS THOUGH THEY WILL HAVE TO RECUSE THEMSELVES FROM ANYTHING THAT HAS TO DO WITH1B ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT WITH MANY OF THE BIG ISSUES THAT ARE BEFORE THE PLNING COMMISSION THIS YEAR. SO BECAUSE THEY HAD THE DEESE YENS IS I TO POINT OUT THE CONFLICT OF INTEREST, WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO CONSTANTLY RECUSE THEMSELVES FROM CONVERSATIONS OF VOTES ON PLANNING COMMISSION? I THINK THAT AGAIN IS AN INAPPROPRIATE APPOINTMENT. AS FAR AS THE CONSIDERATIONS OF AVOIDING THE PERCEPTION OF A CONFLICT OF INTEREST, AN EMPLOYEE OF OXFORD COMPANY CERTAINLY DOESN'T BECAUSE WE NOTE CO DONATED THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT TO YOUR FIVEAN ANDER $2,000 FROM THE STABRS, DARK MONEY PAC. SO I JUST FIND THESE TWO CANDIDATES TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION WILL NOT DO A THING TO REDUCE DIVISIVENESS IN OUR COMMUNITY. INDEED, I THINK IT WILL BE THE OPPOSITE. I WILL VOTE NO ON THE ENTIRE SLATE. YOU RECALL I E-MAILED YOU ABOUT THIS. I NEVER HEARD BACK FROM YOU. I WAS GIVING YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO PULL THESE OFF AND RECONSIDER BUT CLEARLY YOU'RE NOT GOING TO. OF I URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO JUST THINK ABOUT WHO YOU ARE APPROVING IF YOU VOTE YES FOR THIS SLA OF APPOI TOGHT. THANK YOU.
01:17:41.357: >> Mayor Taylor:  ANY DISCUSSION? COUNSEL SILLMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:17:55.204: >> Councilman Ramlawi:  YES. I WON'T TAKE AS LONG. HE DON'T HAVE AS MANY ISSUES. BUT I AM CONCERNED WITH THE EMPLOYEE OF OXFORD BEING ON A PLANNING COMMISSION AT THE TIME THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS. THAT WILL COME FORTH THAT ARE GOING TO BE CHARGED. IT'S NOT A SECRET BY NOW, OBVIOUSLY THAT COMPANY HERE LOCALLY HAS DONATED AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF MONEY POLITICALLY, HUGE SUMS OF MONEY. AND I AM UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE CONFLICT OF INTEREST. IT'S JUST AN ENORMOUS POTENTIAL FOR CONFLICT OF INTEREST. I KNOW THAT T ARE WELL INTENDED AND QUALIFIED MOST LIKELY, BUT I, FOR THE -- FOR THAT SAKE, I JUST CAN'T PUT MYSELF IN THE POSITION TO SUPPORT ONE OF THE TWO MEMBERS FOR THE PLANNING COMMISSION. SO I WOULD LIKE A ROLL CALL FOR THAT.
01:19:11.147: >> Mayor Taylor:  ROLL CALL FOR MR. LEE. HER DISCUSSION? [NO AUDIBLE RESPONSE] COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
01:19:23.292: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I SHOULD NAME NAMES AND ROLL CALL ALL THREE IF THAT'S AMENABLE TO MY COLLEAGUE MR. RAMLAWI.
01:19:32.268: >> Councilman Ramlawi:  IT'S AMENABLE TO ME IF WITH THE BODY.
01:19:36.072: >> Mayor Taylor:  YOU HAVE THE EXCLUSIVE RIGHT TO REQUEST A ROLL CALL.
01:19:39.675: >> Councilman Ramlawi:  OK. IN THAT CASE, THEN, YEAH. SIDARAR. LEE,OBERT WHITE.
01:19:47.416: >> Mayor Taylor:  I SHOULD SAY FOR CLARITY, COUNCILMEMBERS, EACH COUNCILMEMBER HAS -- I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE PROTOCOL IS I TREAT NOMINATIONS APPOINTMENTS SIMILAR TO THE CONSENT AGENDA. IF ONE MEMBER WISHES TO HAVE A ROLL CALL ON ANY THAT CARRIES THE DAY. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
01:20:08.805: >> Councilmember Hayner:  SO IT'S ALL OR NOTHING OR JUST PULLING THOSE THREE IT VOTE SEPARATELY?
01:20:14.010: >> Mayor Taylor:  I'VE HEARD A REQUEST TO VOTE ON THOSE THREE SEPARATE AND THE BALANCE TOGETHER. I GUESS'LL JUST VERY BRIEF FOLLOW-UP AND SAY WITH RESPECT TO THE ISSUE OF CONFLICT ON MR. LEE HAS IDENTIFIED HIMSELF AS, OF COURSE, AN EMPLOYEE AND HAS PLEDGED TO RECUSE HIMSELF WHEN A CONFLICT EXISTS. I THINK HIS EXPERTISE IN THIS AREA WILL BE EXTREMELY VALUABLE FOR A COMMISSION THAT DOESN'T PRESENTLY HAVE SOMEONE WITH THAT SORT OF COMMERCIAL EXPERIENCE. LET'S SEE. SO, LET'S HAVE A VOTE, PLEASE, WITH THE GROUP WITH THE EXCEPTION OF MR. WHITE, MS. CLARKE, AND MR. LEE. ALL IN FAVOR? KYES KYES. OPPOSED? APPROVED. MOVED. SECONDED. ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE.

01:27:08.390: >> YES. THIS IS EDWARD. I HAVE A COMMENT REGARDING PROPOSED CHANGES TO SIGN ORDINANCE. HAVING READ THE SIGN ORDINANCE, I RECOGNIZE A COUPLE OF PROBLEMS WITH IT. ONE IS THAT DURING THE CURRENT PANDEMIC NUMBER OF OUR BUSINESSES AROUND TOWN HAVE NEEDED TO ADDRESS THEIR SIGNAGE TO ACCOMMODATE THE FACT THAT PEOPLE AREN'T ACTUALLY GOING IN STORES. ANY ENFORCEMENT OF NEW, MORE RESTRICTED RULES, WOULD BE UNFORTUNATE AT THIS POINT. WHAT WE NEED RIGHT NOW IS FLEXIBILITY TO THE HER CHANTS CHANTS. SECOND IS REGARDING REGULAR LAIFTION POLITICAL SIGNAGE AND YARD SIGNS. INK IT'S ABSURD THAT THE CITY SHOULD GET IN THE WAY OF PEOPLE PUTTING UP YARD SIGNS IN THEIR YARD TO RESTRICT IT TO SIX SIGNS, SIX TEMPORARY SIGNS THAT COST $1 A PIECE. IT SEEMS LIKE AN OVERREACH. EVEN IN THE BEST OF TIMES IT WOULD BE AN OVERREACH. IN THIS TIME WHERE PEOPLE ARE LIMITING THEIR SELF-EXPRESSION AND CAN'T SEE EACH OTHER IN PERSON SO MUCH, I THINK THIS WOULD BE A FAILURE OF CITY LEADERSHIP TO ENFORCE THOSE RULES. IN SUMMARY, I THINK THE SIGN ORDINANCE SHOULD NOT BE MODIFIED AS IS SUGGESTED.

01:31:49.905: >> Mayor Taylor:  YES, MA'AM.
01:31:51.240: >> YES, HI. I'M A RESIDENT ON I H SOME SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENT. SPECIFICALLY MY CONCERN IS IN REGARDS TO THE OPENING OF ELY ROAD. I LIVE HERE WITH MY THREE YOUNG KIDS. AND THE IDEA OF THAT BEING OPENED IS JUST REALLY VERY DANGEROUS AND WE'RE REALLY CONCERNED. AN ADDITIONAL 200 CARS PASSING MY HOME, OUR NEIGHBORHOOD, WITH LOTS OF KIDS THAT PLAY OUTSIDE, SEVERAL STRETCHES OF THE AREA ON ELY AND YOST HAVE NO SIDEWALK RIGHT IN FRONT OF OUR SCHOOL, AND SO WE WOULD JUST URGE YOU CONSIDER, YOU KNOW, HAVING ELY OPEN FOR EMERGENCIES ONLY. THE SAFETY OF OUR NEIGHBORHOOD IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO US. WHILE WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE DEVELOPMENT NEEDS TO MOVE FORWARD, WE JUST REALLY, REALLYN AT WHAT ALL OF THAT TRAFFIC IN FRONT OF OUR HOMES, STREETS WITHOUT SIDEWALKS WORK DO TO OUR NEIGHBORHOOD. THANK YOU.
01:33:11.186: >> Mayor Taylor:  THANK YOU.
01:33:21.830: >> Clerk Beaudry:  CALL WE ARE PHONE NUMBER ENDING IN 411, DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT?
01:33:30.372: >> GOOD EVENING, MOR,HA MEMBERS OF COUNCIL. CAN YOU HEAR ME?
01:33:33.709: >> Mayor Taylor:  YES, WE CAN.
01:33:35.777: >> THANK YOU, MAYOR TAYLOR. FIRST OFF, CONGRATULATIONS TO THE NEW MEMBERS OF COUNCIL. MY NAME IS JAMES DEMOOR, 2771 MAPLEWOOD AVENUE, TOWARDS THE OTHER END OF THE POLITICAL PRECINCT BUT NEAR THE FOR REST SUBDIVISION, SITE OF THE BRIGHTDAWN PROPOSAL. FORGIVE ME FOR THIS PREPARED STATEMENT BUT I WANTED TO MAKE SURE MY POINTS ARE CLEAR. OF I'M SPEAKING YOUS A FORME PLANNING COMMISSION AS WELL AS A NEARBY RESENT IN ONE REGARD I'M SORRY TO SEAT PROPERTY DEVELOPED IT PRACTICALLY IS A SLICE OF COUNTRY WITHIN THE CITY LIMITS. I ENJOY WALKING MY FOUR-LEGGED TRAINING PARTNERS. IT'S COUNTRYSIDE WITH CERTAIN REGARDS. BUT IT IS ALSO THE SITE OF HOMES BULLDOZED FOR A PROJECT APPROVED IN 2007 WITH R4 ZONING IF THE SITE HAD REMOVED IN A DENSITY BELOW R4 ZONING CLASS, I COULD COULD SEE WHERE CONNECTIVITY FROM BURTON ROAD WOULD HAVE MADE SENSE. HA M-MODAL CONNECTY. I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY CITY PRESS.NGNSISTED ON THIS I SUSPECT WHEN FOR REST BROOK WAS BUILT IN THE EARLY 1960S, LOWER DENSITY HOUSING WAS CONTEMPLATED OR REDEVELOPMENT OF EXISTING PARSE ELS WHEN U.S. 23 WAS CONSTRUCTED. HOWEVER, THOUGH THIS PROJECT UNDER THE CURRENT ZONING CAN BE CONSIDERED A, QUOTE BY RIGHT, UNQUOTE PROJECT, LET ME, AS MENTIONED, NOTE THAT THIS PROJECT WOULD INJECT MUCH MORE TRAFFIC INTO AN EXISTING NEIGHBORHOOD WITH MANY FAMILIES AND CHILDREN WHO UTILIZE FOR RESTROOK POOLTHE W SEONS.AND THAGHBORHOOD IS WALKABLE TO THE ELEMENTARY SCHO. THIS CONNECTIVITY WOULD, IN ESSENCE, COULD ARGUABLY CREATE A DETRIMENT TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH, SAFETY AND WELFARE OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD. FOR THAT REASON THE PETITION BEFORE YOU COULD ARGUABLY BE DENIED BY THE CITY DESPITE ITS "BY RIGHT" STATUS. THAT SECTIONED AS I UNDERSTAND IT THE NEIGHBORS WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE NEW MEMBER ARE A DENA TO CREATE AN ALTERNATIVE WHICH WOULD REVIVE THE CONCEPT OF THE PROJECT APPROVED IN 2007 TO ALLOW GATED EMERGENCY ACCES FR ELY TO BTON AND CONTAIN HE CANNED AND OTHER AMENDMENTS CONNECTIVITY. YOU MAY HAVE OTHER THOUGHTS ON THE PROCESS IN TERMS OF CHANGES WOULD LIKE TO MAKE TONIGHT, BUT I DO HOPE THIS COUNCIL, SHOULD YOU WISH TO MOVE FORWARD TO APPROVE THIS PROJECT THIS EVENING, MAKE THIS REVISION TO ALLOW TURNAROUND AT THE NORTHERN END OF BURTON, TO ALLOW BUSES AND UTILITIES TO SERVICE THE NEW COMPLEX WITHOUT NEGATIVELY AFFECTING THE EXISTING NEIGHBORHOOD. MY THANKS TO COUNCIL MEMBERNA AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE IN WORKING WITH THE NEIGHBORHOOD ON THE POSSIBILITY OF THIS PROJECT. I HATE TO GO OFF TOPIC, BUT THE BRIEF TIME REMAINING, A NOTE, TOO, AS WELL TO MY -- KUDOS TO CYNTHIA WILBANKS OF THE I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH HER. I WISH HER WELL. WITH THAT I SAY THANK YOU FOR CONSIDERING MY REMARKS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THIS EVENING. I WILL MUTE MYSELF NOW.
01:36:39.427: >> Mayor Taylor:  THANK YOU.
01:36:49.671: >> Clerk Beaudry:  CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING IN 005, DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT?
01:36:58.380: >> GOOEVENING, MAYOR TAYLOR AND COUNL. THIS IS BRIAN SMITH. I LIVET 2803 LILANOAD. I AM ALSO THE LEGAL REPRENTATIVE OF 2800 BURTON ROAD, OPPITE SIDE OF THIS ROAD. ANT -- I H AN OPPORTUNI CO THIS MORNING WITH SOME OF MY CONRNS. I KNOW THAT YOU'VE PROBABLY BEEN DELUGEDY MANY MEMBERS OF E HOPEFULLY U'VE BEE HEARING KIND OF A UNIED COMN MESSAGE, WHICH ISE AS A FOR RESTROOK COMMUNI WELCO THE DEVELOPMT. THISAS BN LG-TIME COMING THE BEGINNG.EEN HE SIN IT IS NOWIMEO MOVE FORWARD ON THIS PIECE OF PROPERTY AND THE DEVELOPMENT T WE ALSO WANT TO PROTECT THE EXISTING HOMEOWNERS AND THE COMMUNITY THAT SURROUNDS THE FOR RESTBROOK NEIGHBORHOOD FROM A SAFETY PERSPECTIVE, PUBLIC SAFETY PERSPECTIVE. I APPRECIATE AND WOULD LIKE TO THANK COUNCILMAN RADINA AND BRAND BOTH FOR THEIR HARD WORK TODAY. THEY'VE BOTH BEEN WORKING HARD, DILIGENTLY TO TRY TO COME UP WITH A SOLUTION WHICH CAN HERE THE NEIGHBORS' CRNSVE SAFETYHILENUING ALONG THE PROCESS OF THE DEVELOPMENT. SO WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO ASK COUNCIL TO STRONGLY CONSIDER AND SUPPORT IS, FRANKLY, SOMETHING THAT COUNCIL AGREED TO 13 YEARS AGO WHEN THIS PROPERTY WAS REZONED FROM SINGLE FAMILY HOUSING TO MULTIPLE FAMILY HOUSING. AND THAT IS A CONNECTION BETWEEN BURTON AND ELY ROAD BUT FOR EMERGENCY USE ONLY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME.
01:38:51.660: >> Mayor Taylor:  TOU
01:39:04.372: >> Clerk Beaudry:  CALL WE ARE PHONE NUMBER ENDING IN 321, DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT?
01:39:14.416: >> YES, HI. I LIVE AT 2818 LILLIAN. THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO LET US SPEAK THIS EVENING. I SENT AN E-MAIL TO MAYOR TAYLOR AND COUNCIL THANK YOU. I HOPE YOU ALLERE ABLEO I WOULD LIKE TO RTE WHAT MY NEIGHBORS AND I ARE HERE TO EXPRESS OUR CONCERNS TONIGHT ABOUT OPENING ELY ROAD TO BURTON. I HAVE YOUNG DAUGHTER. SHE WALKS TO SCHOOL. THIS AREA IS ALREADY A CUT-THROUGH FROM YOST TO PACKARD AND HAVING THE OPENING OF ELY TO BURTON ROAD MAKES ME REALLY CONCERNED. IT IS NOT SAFER. I DON'T KNOW IF ALL OF HAVE YOU HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME INTO OUR NEIGHBORHOOD AND ACTUALLY WALK AND LOOK AT ELY WHERE I A WHERE THE ECTI BE, BUT THERE'S A SMALL STREET. THERE ARE VERY FEW HOMES. IT'S RIGHT NEXT TO A NEIGHBORHOOD POOL. AND RIGHT NEXT TO THE STREET WHERE ALL OUR NEIGHBORHOOD CHILDREN WALK TO SCHOOL WHERE THERE IS NO SIDEWALK AND PEOPLE ARE CUTTING THROUGH AT RUSH HOUR WHICH IS EXACTLY WHEN OUR CHILDREN ARE GOING TO SCHOOL AND COMING HOME. IT IS UNSAFE. I JUST FEEL LIKE THE COUNCIL CAN WORK WITH US TO MAKE A SAFER OPTION SO OUR CHILDREN CAN BE SAFE. I REALLY WISH THAT THEY WOULD CONSIDER USING A THAS BE13 YEARS AGO, AS MY NEIGHR BRIANMITH H SAID. AND I THINK IT'S JUST REALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU LISTEN TO THE COMMUNITY. WE WELCOME DEVELOPMENT. THIS AREA IS CHANGING AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT AS A COMMUNITY. BUT WE REALLY WISH THAT OUR COUNCIL WOULD RESPECT THE WISHES OF THE COMMUNITY EIGHTH THE MAJORITY OF OUR NEIGHBORS ARE SAYING THIS IS UNSAFE AND PLEASE, PLEASE, WE URGE YOU TO CONSIDER PUTTING A GATE AT THE CONNECTION OF THE ELY AND BURTON ROAD. THANK YOU.
01:41:01.790: >> Mayor Taylor:  THANK YOU.
01:41:13.268: >> Clerk Beaudry:  JULIET PRESSLE, DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT?
01:41:20.408: >> I DO. CAN YOU HEAR ME?
01:41:22.377: >> Mayor Taylor:  YES, WE CAN.
01:41:25.180: >> OK. WELL, I AM JULIETTE, 2625 LILLIAN. I WANT TO ECHO WHAT BRIAN SMITH HAS SAID. WE RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS A BY RIGHT DEVELOPMENT. WE DO APPROVE OF IT OR WEO RECOGNIZE IT NEEDS TO BE APPROVED. OUR ONLY OBJECTION AT THIS POINT OUT OF CONCERN FOR THE AMOUNT OF TRAFFIC THAT WILL INCREASE THROUGHOUT OUR NEIGHBORHOOD. AND YOU HEARD ALL OF THE STUFF BEFORE WITH THE PRIOR PROPOSAL IS THAT 13 YEARS AGO WHEN THE CITY COUNCIL UP ZONED THIS AREA TO THE 120-UNIT MULTIPLE FAMILY DWELLING, IT ALSO RD THAT THECERNS THAT WE HADT OPENN WERE ABSOLUTELY VALID, AND THEY VOTED UNANIMOUSLY TO PROVIDE FOR A 20-FOOT PEDESTRIAN WALKWAY AND A GATED ACCESS FOR EMERGENCY VEHICLES. AND THERE'S ALSO ROOM FOR A TURN-AROUND FOR UTILITY VEHICLES AND BUSES AND SO FORTH. THERE'S NO REASON NOT TO DO THAT TODAY. WE'RE ASKING THAT YOU DO THAT. WE KNOW THAT TRAVIS AND JULIE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON A PROPOSAL TO MODIFY THE S SO THATE N COUPLE THE ISSUE OFO THE ACTUAL AREA OF APPROVAL FROM THIS OPENING WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT THE DEVELOPER HAS NEVER FELT STRONGLY ABOUT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER, SO IT'S NOT THE DEVELOPER'S CONCERN. WE KNOW YOU'VE BEEN INUNDATED PROBABLY WITH LETTERS FROM PEOPLE LIKE ME AND MY NEIGHBORS AND YOU MAY NOT HAVE HAD A CHANCE TO READ THEM ALL. BUT THEY ALL SAY THE SAME THING. WE WOULD LIKE VERY MUCH FOR YOU TO SUPPORT THE PROPOSAL THAT TRAVIS IS GOING TO BE MAKINGG TO BASICALLY REINSTATE WHAT CITY COUNCILGREED TO UNANIMOUSLY 13 YEARS AGO BECAUSE NOTHING'S CHANGED. IF ANYTHING, TRAFFIC HAS INCREASED. THANK YOU.
01:43:29.103: >> Mayor Taylor:  THANK YOU.
01:43:39.948: >> Clerk Beaudry:  CALL WE ARE THE NUMBER ENDING 577. CALLER 577, DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT?
01:43:57.398: >> HELLO. I'M JIM HALL. I LIVE AT 2733 LILLIAN. I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE TRAFFIC THAT'S GOING TO COME THROUGH TO THIS DEVELOPMENT IS NOT ONLY THE FOLKS WHO ARE LIVING THERE, IT'S ALSO PEOPLE LIKE AMAZON DOOD DELIVERY, LYFTS AND URSHAT ARE GOING TO COME RIGHT THROUGH INTO OUR NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE SOME DAY I HOPE MY KIDS WILL GO DOWN TO THE POOL. OR WALK TO SCHOOL. SO I DO HOPE THAT WE CAN COME TO AN AGREEMENT WHERE WE PUT THIS GATE UP ALONG ELY ROAD. TH NEIGHBORHOOD BY FOOT, THOSEOF WHO ARE LIVING IN THE DEVELOPMENT WILL LIKELY GO TO THE SAME SCHOOLS THAT MY FUTURE KIDS WILL. WE'LL STILL HAVE THE INTERWEAVING BUT JUST MAKING IT A SAFE PLACE FOR OUR COMMUNITY WOULD GO A LONG WAY FOR US. SO, PLEASE CONSIDER THAT AS YOU'RE LOOKING AT THIS PROPOSAL. THANKS.
01:45:20.415: >> Mayor Taylor:  THANK YOU.
01:45:28.189: >> Clerk Beaudry:  CALLER 557, DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT? CALLER ENDING IN 557, GO AHEAD.
01:45:40.234: >> HI. CAN YOU HEAR ME?
01:45:42.003: >> Mayor Taylor:  YES, WE CAN.
01:45:45.073: >> GREAT. THANK YOU. I LIVE ON LILLIAN ROAD. I JUST WANTED TO CALL IN AND REALLY REITERATE WHAT MY NEIGHBORS ARE SAYING. I'M REALLY CONCERNED A ALL OF PEDESTRIANS ESPECIALLY CHILDREN IN OUR NEIGHBORHOO I THINK THERE SHOULD BE A GATE AT THE END OF ELY FOR EMERGENCY USE ONLY. IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD WE HAVE A TON OF CHILDREN RUNNING AROUND AND HEADING TO THE POOL AND WALKING TO SCHOOL. I KNOW THAT IF WE DO NOT HAVE A GATE, I THINK THAT -- I JUST DON'T THINK THAT WOULD BE SAFE FOR EVERYBODY IN THE NEIGHBORHO. SO T WOULD BE GREAVE A GATE. AN TAKING THE TIME.OR LTENING THANKS.
01:46:35.823: >> Mayor Taylor:  THANK YOU.
01:46:41.529: >> Clerk Beaudry:  CALLER ENDING IN 039, DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT?
01:46:52.807: >> YES. HELLO. CAN YOU HEAR ME?
01:46:54.809: >> Mayor Taylor:  YES, WE CAN.
01:46:57.779: >> I LIVE AT 2448 YOST BOUL BOULEVD. YOST IS ALREADY A CUT THROUGH, YOST AND BRANDYWINE. SO THE TRAFFIC SITUATION HERE IS ALREADY NOT GREAT. I THINK ADDING A 250-PLUS CARS, PLUS AT DECISIONAL DELIVERY DRIVERS AND ALL OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE NEIGHBORHOOD CUTTING THROUGH, FOR ALL OF THE SAFETY REASONS THAT HAVE ALREADYEEN SED, THE CHI WALKI TO SCHOOL DURING RUSH HOUR, THE POOL, I JUST THINK IT CREATES A VERY UNSAFE SITUATION. I UNDERSTAND THE NEED TO WANT TO CONNECT THE NEIGHBORHOODS. BUT I DON'T THINK THAT SHOULD BE DONE AT THE SAFETY OF AN EXISTING NEIGHBORHOOD WHEN THERE'S CLEARLY A DESIRE FROM THE CURRENT NEIGHBORHOOD TO NOT HAVE THAT HAPPEN. SO WHILE I WOULD LOVE FOR THE OPENING TO HAPPEN ON NDERSTANDING OF BY RIGHT AND HOW THINGS ARE MOVING FORWARD, THAT'S NOT AN OPTION. SO I WOULD REALLY LIKE THE COUNCIL TO STRONGLY CONSIDER ADDING THE GATE SO THERE IS AN EMERGENCY ACCESS POINT BUT NO POINT FOR THROUGH TRAFFIC. THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME.

I'LL BE UPRONT AND SAY THAT I WANT YOU TO STRONGLY CONSIDER TH PROPOSAL THAT TRAVIS AND HAVE A GATE ACROSS ELY AND HAVE IT BE USED ONLY FOR EMERGCY ACCESS A WASNANIMOUSLY AGREED TO IN 2007.

IN ADDITION TO DELIVERY VEHICLES AND UBER AND THE POINTS THAT I DIDN'T EVEN THINK THERE'S A HUGE INCREASE IN TRAFFIC SINCE 2007 BECAUSE OF THE WIDESPREAD ADOPTION OF GOOGLE MAPS, WAZE AND OTHER GPS NAVIGATIONS. SO THERE WILL BE AN EVEN GREATER INCREASE IN TRAFFIC FOR A NEIGHBORHOOD. ON A PERSONAL LEVEL, I AM A MOTHER OF THREE SMALL CHILDREN, TWO OF THEM GO TO THE SCHOOL AND ONE IS ONLY 2 AND WILL GO IN THE FUTURE. DA OR ANY OTHER KIDS TO BE THIIT IN DANGER. I'M NOT SURE IF YOU'R FAMILIAR WITH THE GEOGRAPHY OF THE AREA, BUT IT'S HILLY, CURVEY, AND IT'S NOT THE -- THE ROADS ARE NOT WELL MAINTAINED. IN THE WINTER IT GETS VERY ICY. I GREW UP IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. I WAS LATE TO FINALS IN HIGH SCHOOL BECAUSE MY 1984 CADILLAC SLID DOWN ON BLACK ICE AND GOT STUCK IN A SNOWBANK ON LILLIAN. SO THE POSSIBILITY OF CARS SLIDING THROUGH THAT INTERSECTION OF LILLIAN AND ELY IS VERY REAL AS MY DATA SHOWS. AND AS AN ASSAULT WHEN I OWNED MY OWN HOME -- AS AN ADULT, MY KIDS ENJOY RIDING THEIR BIKES DOWN THE HILL ON LILLIAN BECAUSE KIDS LIKE THAT THRILL.
01:51:34.488: >> Clerk Beaudry:  30 SIKDZ.
01:51:36.857: >> AND TWO OF THEM HAVE RIDDEN STRAIGHT OVER THE CURB ACROSS ELY AND STOPPED ON THE OTHER CURB. SO, THAT'S -- I'VE WITNESSED SEVERAL OTHER KIDS  AS WELL. SO PLEASE CONSIDER THE SAFETY OF ALL OF ANN ARBOR'S RESIDENTS NOT JUST ONES IN THE TOO TOUR. THANK YOU. -- FUT Crk Beaudry:  CALLER ENDING IN 224, DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT? CALLER ENDING IN 224, DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT?
01:52:19.266: >> YES.
01:52:22.036: >> Clerk Beaudry:  GO AHEAD.
01:52:25.272: >> HI. I LIVE ON 2618 LILLIAN ROAD, WITH MY HUSBAND PHIL AND OUR CORGI REGGIE. I SPEAK ON THEIR BEHALF AS WELL AS MY OWN WHEN I SAY THAT WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF TRAVIS' PROPOSAL TO OPEN UP THE ROAD BUT FOR EMERGENCY TRAFFIC ONLY. I CAN ECHO WHAT THE PREVIOUS CALLERS SAID. I LIVE REALLY NEAR THE CORNER OF LILLIAN AND ELY. AND DURING THE SNOWY WEATHER OUR NEIGHBORHOOD IS NOT ALWAYS PLOWED THE BEST. I HAVE PERSONALLY SLID SEVERAL TIMES TURNING L TON ELY FROM LILLIAN, ESPECIALLY IN THE WINTER MONTHS I FEEL THIS IS UNSAFE. I'M ALSO A RUNNER AND WALK OUR DOG A LOT AND WOULD APPRECIATE NOT HAVING THE ROADS OPENED UP TO HUNDREDS OF MORE CARS AND DELIVERY VEHICLES, AMAZON TRUCKS, UBER. EVERYTHING THAT EVERYBODY ELSE HAS SAID. ANYTIME AGREEMENT WITH EVERYTHING WHAT OUR NEIGHBORS HAVE SAID. I ALSO SENT A JUST WANTED TO EMPHASIZE FACT THAT WE ARE PRESENTING A UNITED FRONT AS A NEIGHBORHOOD. THE COMMENTS HAVE BEEN PRETTY UNANIMOUS THAT EVERYBODY IS CONCERNED ABOUT THE SAFETY OF OURSELVES AND OUR NEIGHBORS AND OUR KIDS AND OUR PETS. APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THE TIME TO HEAR US OUT AND CONSIDER PUTTING IN A GATE TO KEEP THE ACCESS LIMITED TO EMERGENCY VEHICLES ONLY BETWEEN ELY AND BURTON. THANK YOU.>> Maylor:  THANK YOU.
01:54:05.372: >> Clerk Beaudry:  CALLER ENDING IN 480, DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT?
01:54:13.480: >> HI. MI LIVE AT 2721 LILLIAN ROAD. I AM ALSO -- WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK ABOUT THE SAFETY OF OPENING THE ROAD AT ELY TO BURTON. THESE NEIGHBORHOODS WERE ACTUALLY D DIG NOT TO BE CUT-THROUGHS IF YOU LOOK AT THE GEOGRAPHY OF THEM, THEY ARE CURVEY FOR A REASON. IT WAS CONSIDERED SAFE FOR ELEMENTARY-AGED CHILDREN TO WALK WITHIN THE ROAD TO GET TO SCHOOL, WHICH IS WHAT OUR LOCAL PITSFIELD CHILDREN HAVE TO DO. THERE ARE NO SIDEWALKS OVER PART OF THE ROUTE TO SCHOOL. AND CHILDREN AND THEIR PARENTS IN STROLLERS AND ON BIKES ARE REGULARLY WITHIN THE STREET. THE CUT-THROUGH TRAFFICHAT ALREADY EXISTS COMING ALONG BRANDYWINE THROUGH YOST IS ALREADY CAUSING ACCIDENTS AT ALL TIMES OF THE DAY AND ALL TIMES OF THE YEAR NOT JUST THE WINTER. WHEN WE SPOKE ABOUT THIS TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION, THEY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THERE WERE SAFETY ISSUES WITH THE NEIGHBORHOOD. THEIR RESPONSE WAS THERE'S ALREADY AN ISSUE SO WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE INSTEAD OF COMPOUNDING THE SAFETY ISSUES. AS PART OF MR. RADINA'S PROPOSAL, I WOULD ASK THAT THERE BE A COMPREHENSIVE TRAFFIC STUDY THAT ACTUALLY INCLUDES THE AFFECTED ROADS. CURRENTLY THE TRAFFIC STUDY FOR THIS DEVELOPMENT ONLY TOOK INTO ACCOUNT PACKARD AND BURTON. IT DID NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT BRANDYWINE OR YOST WHICH WOULD BE THE MAIN CUT-THROUGH ALONG WITH ELY AND LILLIAN. I ALSO WANTED TO MAKE T COMMENT THAT BUSES -- ER WAS SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT SCHOOL BUSES NOT BEING ABLE TO COME IN AND TURN AROUND OR NOT BEING ABLE TO SAFELY GET THROUGH. THE BRIGHTDAWN PROPERTY AS WELL AS FOREST BROOK IS WITHIN THE WALKING ZONE F FOR PITSFIELD AS WELL AS SCARLET. THERE WOULD BE ONLY EDUCATION BUSES COMING THROUGH. I BELIEVE THAT IF THE DEVELOPMENT IS NOT SUFFICIENT FOR A BUS TO BE COMING THROUGH THEN THERE ARE OTHER ISSUES WITH THE DEVELOPMENT THAT WOULD NOT BE SOLVED BY OPENING ELY.
01:56:40.194: >> Clerk Beaudry:  30 SECONDS.
01:56:41.795: >> I WOULD LIKE TO ALSO POINT OUT THAT IT'S NOT JUST OUR CHILDREN WITHIN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD THAT WOULD BE AT RISK. ANY CHILDREN IN THIS DEVELOPMENT WHICH I HOPE THERE WILL BE CHILDREN WOULD ALSO BE PUT AT RISK TRYING TO GET TO SCHOOL IN THIS SITUATION. SO, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. PLEASE SUPPORT THE IDEA OF KEEPING A GATE THERE. IF AT SOM POINT IT BECOMES NECESSARY TO OPEN THATHA WE ACTUALLY DO A FULL STUDY BEFORE FIGURING OUT MAKING AN ALREADY DANGEROUS AREA MORE DANGEROUS. THANK YOU.
01:57:17.031: >> Mayor Taylor:  THANK YOU.
01:57:26.306: >> Clerk Beaudry:  CALLER ENDING IN 664, DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT? PHONE NUMBER ENDING IN 664, DO YOU HAVE A ACC COMMENT? CALLER 664, IF YOU PRESS STAR 6, YOU CAN UNMUTE YOURSELF. CALLER 117, DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT? CALLER ENDING IN 117, DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT? CALLER 117, IF YOU PRESS STAR 6, YOU CAN UNMUTE YOURSELF. CALLER ENDING IN 512, DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT?
01:59:08.475: >> HI, I DO. I LIVE AT 2011 LILLIAN ROAD. I KNOW HALVE OF YOU FROM LAST YEAR DISCUSSION THE SAME TOPIC. MY COMMENTS REMAIN THE SAME. THERE WAS CONCERN WITH TRAFFIC BEFORE THERE REMAINS A CONCERN WITH TRAFFIC. THERE WAS A CONCERN WITH TRAFFIC DOWN YOST BEFORE THE DEVELOPMENT WAS PROPOSED. I REITERATE WHAT MY NEIGHBORS HAVE SAID. WE HAVE SECTIONS OF STREETS WITH NO SIDEWALKS. TO BE OPENED TO POTENTIALLY 250 CARS IN AN AREA THAT'S ALREADY HAVING PEOPLE MOVE QUICKLY IN THE MORNING RUSHING TO GET TO THEIR JOBS AND ACCESS THE HIGHWAY. I'M NOT ONLY CONCERNED WITH THE AMOUNT OF INCREASE OF VEHICLE TRAFFIC BUT ALSO THE INCREASE OF CHILDREN IN THE SAME EXACT AREA IN CARS IT MAKES NO SENSE.EASE YOU GUYS TALKED EARLIER ABOUT YOUR MISSION TO SUSTAIN AND ENHANCE A VIBRANT, SAFE, AND DIVERSE COMMUNITY. WE'D LIKE TO GROW OUR COMMUNITY WITH THIS DEVELOPMENT IN THE BACK. WE NEED IT TO BE SAFE SO PEOPLE CAN WALK AND WE CAN GET TO SCHOOL. THIS IS PERSONAL FOR ME I ALSO HAVE THREE YOUNG CHILDREN THAT WALK TO SCHOOL. THIS YEAR THIS COMING YEAR, WILL BE THE FIRST TIME I WILL BE OUT WITH A STRR DOING THAT WHERE EVERY TIME I DUMPED MY CHILD INTO THE SEET BECAUSE THAT WAS THE ONLY WAY TO GET MY OTHER CHILD TO THE SCHOOL. THAT WILL THEN NOW APPLY TO ALL OF THE OTHER PARENTS LIVING IN THAT COMPLEX. IT FEELS NEGLIGENT AND UNACCEPTABLE FOR US TO PROCEED WITH DEVELOPING AN AREA WITHOUT ADDRESSING THE PROBLEMS OF THE PEOPLE THAT ALREADY LIVE THERE. JUST ADDING TO IT. I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU IN THE FUTURE ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO FIX THIS. THANK YOU
02:01:19.139: >> Clerk Budry:  TED, D YOU. YOHAVE A COMMENT?
02:01:34.755: >>ES. CAN U HEARE?
02:01:36.723: >> Mayor Tlor:  YES, WE N.
02:01:39.393: >>GO EVENING, CI'D LIKE TO THANR BEING HERE AND THANK YOU FOR CONSIDERING THIS PJECT. I'M PART OF THEROJECT DEVELOPMEN TEAM, PART OF DWESTE CONLTING. I WANTED TOUST QUICKLY NE TO MEMBERS OF MIDSTERNTHER CONSULNG, TOM COVERT, TINAIX AN MIKE, OWNERS ARE REPRESENTING SHT WARTS FAMILY, DEVELOPERS AND OWNERS. WE ALSO HAVE PROJECT ARCHITECT IS HERE AND AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU GUYS HAVE. AND ALSO HAVE SLIDES AVAILABLE FOR LATER IF THAT WILL AID IN ANY DISCUSSION. JUST WANTED TO MENTION THAT AND, AGAIN, THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.
02:02:34.181: >> Mayor Taylor:  THANK YOU.
02:02:44.725: >> Clerk Beaudry:  CALLER 442, DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT?
02:02:52.733: >> GOOD EVENING. MY NAME'S ADAM GOODMAN. I HAVE TO ADMIT I DON'T LIVE ANYWHERE PARTICULARLY NEAR THIS DEVELOPMENT. BUT ONE THING THAT STRUCK ME AS I LISTEN TO ALL OF THE COMMENTS IS THAT ALL OF THE NEIGHBORS IN THE AREA ARE MAKING REASONABLE REQUESTS TO PRESERVE THE THINGS OUT THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD THAT THEY CARE ABOUT BUT NOBODY IS SPEAKING UP FOR THE FUTURE RES RESIDENTS SO I GUESS I'M VOLUNTEERING TO DO THAT. FIRST OF ALL, I DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE CUT-THROUGH TRAFFIC IS A REAL PROBLEM. I MYSELF LIVE ON A STREET THAT SEES A FAIR BIT OF IT. BUT CUT-THROUGH TRAFFIC IS REALLY KIND OF A RESULT OF SOME MISGUIDED DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS MADE FROM THE MID 20TH CENTURY ON WHERE WE CUT OFF THE STREET GRID, TRIED TO FUNNEL ALL THE TRAFFIC ON TO [INDISCERNIBLE] AND THEN THE FEW STREETS THAT STILL DO CONNECT THROUGH END UP GETTING A DELUGE OF PEOPLE TRYING TO GET AROUND. THE MORE THAT WE CUT OFF THE STREET GRID, THE WORSE THE CUT-THROUGH PROBLEM BECOMES. NOW, IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO UNWIND THIS NOW THAT WE'VE BUILT OUT OUR COMMUNITIES IN THIS WAY BUT I WOULD KEEP THAT IN MIND. BEYOND THAT, I ALSO THINK THAT PUTTING UP A GATE COULD CREATE THE PERCEPTION FOR PEOPLE THAT WHO WILL LIVE IN THAT COMPLEX THAT THEY ARE UNWELCOME AND IT COULD CREATE SOME CHALLENGES IT COULD MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO ACCESS THE IMMUNITIES ACROSS FROM THEM, FAX. AND THEY'D HAVE TO GO OUT TON A MAIN ROAD AND ADD AGAIN TO THE SORT OF CONGESTION PROBLEMS THAT LEAD TO CUT-THROUGH TRAFFIC EXISTING IN THE FIRST PLACE. I WILL SAY THOSE WHO KNOW ME KNOW THAT I TEND TO CARE AOT ABOUT NON-MOTORIZED TRANSIT. SO, AS LONG AS THERE'S A CONNECTION FOR PEDESTRIANS AND BICYCLISTS THROUGH THERE, I WON'T OBJECT TOO MUCH TO ANY PLAN THAT RESULTS HERE. BUT I JUST ASK THAT YOU KEEP IN MIND THE NEED OF THE FUTURE RESIDENTS AS WELL AS THE CURRENT ONES. THANK YOU.
02:05:06.166: >> Mayor Taylor:  THANK YOU.
02:05:15.709: >> Clerk Beaudry:  CALLER ENDING IN 164 DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT?
02:05:26.253: >> CAN YOU HEAR ME OK?
02:05:27.654: >> Mayor Taylor:  YES, WE CAN.
02:05:31.424: >> HI. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING US THE TIME TO TALK. I, TOO, AM ASKING YOU TO CONSIDER WHAT SAFETY WOULD BE LIKE, WHAT CONNECTIVITY WILL BE LIKE FOR THAT OPENING AT ELY ROAD AND BURTON. WE UNDERSTAND THAT THIS BY RIGHT AND MR. GOO WAS TALKING ABOUT MANY SOME OTHER POSSIBILITIES BUT IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S VERY LITTLE TIME LEFT TO TALK ABOUT THAT BECAUSE THERE'S REAL INTEREST IN THIS DEVELOPMENT GETTING SOME APPROVAL TONIGHT. SO IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE SAFETY OF BOTH THE PEOPLE FROM THE COMMUNITY WHO WILL BE WALKING, BIKING, AND OTHERWISE TRAVERSING INTO THE NEIGHBORHOOD, INTO THE BUSINESSES, TO BUS STOPS, TO THE SCHOOLS, ETC., AND FOR THE SAKE OF THE RESIDENTS WHO CURRENTLY LIVE THERE, SK FOR THAT OPENING TO BE UTILIZED ONLY BY VEHICLES THAT ARE EMERGENCY VEHICLES. AS I UNDERSTAND IT, THERE WILL STILL BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR BIKE AND FOOT TRAFFIC, BUT WE'RE ASKING FOR VEHICLES TO NOT BE ALLOWED TO GO THROUGH THAT PATHWAY. IN ORDER TO DO THAT WE'RE ASKING FOR A GATE. WE'RE ASKING YOU REALLY THINK ABOUT HOW WE CONSIDER TRAFFIC CALMING MOVING FORWARD FOR THIS NEIGHBORHOOD. THERE ARE RISKS ALREADY. YOU'VE HEARDBOUT THIS VIA E-MAIL AND VIA OTHER CALLERS TONIGHT. THERE ARE SOME CALMING MEASURES THAT ARE GOING TO BE NEEDED. WE'RE ASKING YOU TO REALLY STUDY AND UNDERSTAND THE NEEDS OF THE AREA RATHER THAN ASSUME THAT THEY'VE BEEN STUDIED AND PASSED ALONG YOU. STAFF HAS DONE A LOT OF WORK ON THIS. WE UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT WE'RE ASKING THAT COUNCIL MEMBERS ALSO UNDERSTAND WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IN THIS AREA OF ANN ARBOR. IT SOMETIMES FEELS FORGOTTEN. SOME PEOPLE ARE MENTIONING A CONCERN FOR SCHOOL BUS TRAFFIC. IN TALKING TO MEMBERS OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT, I DON'T KNOW THAT ANYONE FROM DEVELOPMENT OR FROM CITY COUNCIL HAS REACHED OUT TO THE DISTRICT TO REALLY TALK ABOUT WHAT THE NEEDS OF THE SCHOOLS ARE. SO BEFORE WE SPEAK ON BEHALF OF FUTURE RESIDENTS OR FUTURE STUDENTS WHO MIGHT LIVE THERE, I'M ASKING THAT COMMUNICATION REALLY HAPPEN HERE. COMMUNICATION WITH THE COMMUNITY YOU SERVE IS CRITICAL NOT ONLY ON ISS LIKE THIUT IN ALL OF THE DECISIONS THAT YOU'LL BE MAKING WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE DECISIONS.
02:07:57.370: >> Clerk Beaudry:  30 SECONDS.
02:08:01.041: >> I'M ASKING FOR A VALID TRAFFIC STUDY THAT REFLECTS WHAT'S NEEDED IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD BEFORE WE TALK ABOUT WHAT KIND OF TRAFFIC CALMING MEASURES WILL HAPPEN. I'M ASKING THAT YOU TRULY COMMUNICATE WITH THE SCHOOLS, WITH THE RESIDENTS, WITH THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THIS AREA BEFORE YOU MAKE DECISIONS ON THEIR BEHALF. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
02:08:19.092: >> Mayor Taylor:  THANK YOU.
02:08:25.899: >> Clerk Beaudry:  CALLER ENDING IN 851, DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT?
02:08:35.508: >> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TAKING THE TIME TO HEAR OUR CONCERNS. MY NAME IS JOHN LONG, 2451 YOST WITH MY PARTNER. WE'D LIKE TO ECHO THE CONCERNS OF OUR NEIGHBORS. WE'RE EXCITED TO SEE MORE HOUSING BEING BUILT BUT WE HAVE SAFETY CONCERNS OVER THE CONNECTION. I JUST WANTED TO KIND OF BE ANOTHER VOICE AND ECHO OUR CONCERNS. THANK YOU.
02:09:04.370: >> Mayor Taylor:  THANK YOU.
02:09:14.347: >> Clerk Beaudry:  CALLER ENDING IN 335, DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT? [NO AUDIBLE RESPONSE] PHONE NUMBER 335, PRESS STAR 6 TO UNMUTE YOURSELF. [NO AUDIBLE RESPONSE] CALLER 335, DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT? CALLER 014, DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT?
02:10:12.672: >> HELLO? CAN YOU HEAR ME?
02:10:13.940: >> Mayor Taylo  YES, WE CAN.
02:10:23.882: >> HELLO?
02:10:23.882: >> Mayor Taylor:  YES, WE CAN HEAR YOU.
02:10:26.986: >> HI. MY NAME IS PETER, 3630 [INDISCERNIBLE] WITH MY WIFE AND THREE SMALL CHILDREN. I WANTED TO ECHO MY PREVIOUS NEIGHBORS THAT CALLED IN OPPOSITION OF JUST OPEN VEHICULAR TRAFFIC ON THE CONNECTOR BETWEEN ELY AND BURTON ROAD BUT ALLOWING FOR PEDESTRIAN AND CYCLISTS TO ACCESS. I WANTED TO ECHO ANOTHER PREVIOUS CALLER TALKING ABOUT SCHOOL BUSES AND WHAT SHE SAID IS TRUE. PITSFIELD AND SCARLET SCHOOLS ARE WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE OF LY BUS PIC SCH I PICKUP FORERON HIGH SCHOOL. ONLY SPECIAL NEEDS CHILDREN IF THERE ARE ANY, WOULD NEED ACCESS TO BUSES WITHIN THE DEVELOPMENT. AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE FIRE VEHICLE ACCESS PLAN WHERE IT A 48-FOOT LADDER TRUCK THAT SHOULD BE ABLE TO TRAVERSE THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT, THAT ANALYSIS IN WORK HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE. THE LONGEST BUSES YOU CAN FIND AROUND HERE ARE 45 FEET. SO ONE CAN ASSUME A BUS CAN TRAVERSE WHERE A LONGER FIRE TRUCK CAN TRAVERSE THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT. SO THAT'S REALLY IMPORT NOTE. THE OTHER THING I WANTED TO ECHO IS BACK IN 2007 THERE WAS A DISAGREEMENT ABOUT THE TRAFFIC STUDY SO A SUPPLEMENTAL TRAFFIC STUDY SPECIFICALLY TALKING THROUGH TRAFFIC THAT WOULD GO THROUGH FOREST BROOK WAS DONE IN 2007. I DON'T KNOW WHY WE CAN'T DO A SUPPLEMENTAL ONE THIS TIME THRSMS A 13-YEAR DIFFERENCE. THERE'S A JUSTIFICATION FOR ONE THEN. THERE SHOULD BE ONE NOW. IF WE COULD PUSH THROUGH AND GET A SUPPLEMENTAL TRAFFIC STUDY DONE, THE PROPOL THROUGH AT THE BY RIGHT DEVEPMT. T'S DEUPLE THE ARGUMENT ABOUT ELY TO BURTON AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME. THANK YOU.
02:12:13.493: >> Clerk Beaudry:  CALLER ENDING IN 335, DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT?
02:12:30.642: >> HELLO?
02:12:30.642: >> Clerk Beaudry:  DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT?
02:12:34.247: >> YES. I'M ASSUMING CAN Y HEAR  Mayor E CAN.
02:12:39.052: >> GREAT. THANK YOU ALL, FIRST OF ALL, FOR STAYING UP. I KNOW IT'S LATE. IT'S BEEN DARK A COUPLE OF HOURS NOW. THANK YOU FOR LISTENING TO OUR CONCERNS. I LIVE AT 3624 ELY, RIGHT AT THE SOMEWHAT THREE-WAY INTERCEPTION OF LILLIAN AND ELY. I'M PRETTY MUCH DIRECTLY AFFECTED BY THE OPENING YOU HAVE THE BURTON-ELY ROADWAY MY CON I NOT JUST FOR MY NEIGHBORHOOD BUT ALSO IF YOU ARE MOVING PEOPLE IN 200 FAMILIES BACK THERE, THE CONCERN FOR THEIR KIDS AS WELL BECAUSE I'M SURE THEY WILL BE WALKING THROUGH THIS NEIGHBORHOOD AS WELL. I KNOW THERE WAS A REASON THEY NEHBORHOOD BECAU CARS WERE DRING BY FAST AND BEING A NUISANCE TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD. SO THEY P SPEED BUMPS UAS LL ASAFETRIERS THEY ATTEION TO THE TRAFFICSSUENE.SON THAT WE HAVE OUT HERE. AND THAT WILL BE COMPODEDF THAT ROAD GETS ONED UP. I'M ALL FOR OPENING THE RDOR FETY VEHICLES AS WELL AS FOR BIKEAND PESTRIANS. BUT I DO HE A CONRN WITH OPENG IT UP TO VEHICS RIGHT NOW THE BKYARD OF MY HOUS ISURTON ROA EVEN THOUG THAT ROAD DOES NOT TOUGHHTTHERE ARE RS W PULL U BURTON ROA ATTEMPTING TO GO THROUGH. SO I CAN ONLY IMAGI IF THAT AD GETS OPENED UP NOT JUST THE RESIDENTS LIVING THERE BUT MORE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE DRIVING THROUGH JUST TO GET THROUGH TO THE OTHER SIDE. ENDANGERING OUR FAMILIES. OUR COMMUNIT IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE LAST, AT THIS POINT IT SEEMS THAT KIDS CAN WALK AROUND AND SOCIALIZE ON THE STREET WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT A CAR FLYING THROUGH OR SOMETHING ELSE.. I HATE TO THINK THAT WE'RE SHUTTING THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS DOWN BY OPENING UP STREETS TO PASS-THROUGH VEHICLES. AGAIN, THANKS FOR THE TIME. AND FOR LISTENING. TAKE CARE.
02:15:03.129: >> Mayor Taylor:  THANK YOU.
02:15:08.668: >> Clerk Beaudry:  MAYOR, THERE ARE A FEW CALLERS ON THE LINE WHO HAVEN'T YET SPOKEN BUT DO NOT HAVE THEIR HANDS RAISED.
02:15:16.109: >> Mayor Taylor:  ANYBODY WHO WISHES TO SPEAK AT THIS BLIC HEARINGASE CENTER STAR 9 NOW.
02:15:23.649: >> Clerk Beaudry:  CALLER ENDING IN 117, DO YOU HAVE A ACCIDENT.
02:15:29.755: >> YES. CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW?
02:15:32.091: >> Mayor Taylor:  YES, WE CAN.
02:15:34.327: >> GOOD. THANK YOU. I DON'T LIVE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. I LIVE OVER ON PARKWOOD. BUT MY DAUGHTER AND HER FAMILY LIVE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. I'M A GRANDMOTHER. I CAN SEE SOME OF YOU MIGHT BE GRANDPARENTS AND SOME OF ARE YOU TOO YOUNG. THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE GRANDPARENTS KNOW THAT AS KIDS GO THROUGH VARIOUSSHEN THEIR TODDLERS, LITTLE, THEY RUN OUT IN THE STREETS. WHEN THEY ARE MIDDLE SCHOOL OR ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND THEY GO TO PITTSFIELD, TEENS DRIVING CARS, KIDS MAKE MISTAKES. KIDS RUN OUT INTO THE STREETS. I'VE OBSERVED THIS NEIGHBORHOOD FOR SEVERAL YEARS NOW AND IT IS SO CLOSE. I DON'T KNOW IF ANY OF YOU WENT AROUND IN HALLOWEEN AND THE CARE THEY TOOK TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING THAT THEY HANDED OUT WAS GUARDED, EVERYONE WORE MASKS. THEY'RE REALLY, REALLY TIGHT. 'S HARD TO FIND T THESE DAYS MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THEIR NEIGHBORS. I PICKED MY GRANDSON UP FROM THE CHILDREN'S INSTITUTE. WHEN I DRIVE HIM HOME DOWN PACKARD TO TURN ON THAT INTERSECTION WHERE BRANDYWINE IS PEOPLE ARE ZIPPING IN AND OUT, PEOPLE GO DOWN THE STREET SO FAST. I WAS FRIGHTENED A COUPLE OF TIMES. I JUST THINK THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO A TRAFFIC STUDY, HOW COULD IT BE A REALISTIC TRAFFIC STUDY WHEN KIDS AREN'T IN SCHOOL WHEN THEY'RE VIRTUALLY L YOU N'T SEE THE SCHOOL WITH ALL THE CARS PARKED, PARENTS WAITING FOR THE KIDS TO COME OUT, A PARENT PICKING UP A KID THAT MAY HAVE TO GO TO SOME OTHER MEETING SO THEY RUSH OUT DOWN THE STREET ALREADY. SO I WOULD THINK THAT IF THERE'S GOING TO BE A STUDY, AND I THINK THERE SHOULD BE, THEN IT SHOULD BE DELAYED, PUT WHO THIS WHOLE THING ON HOLD. AND MY LAST QUICK POINT THRAIRVETION GENTLEMAN WORRIED ABOUT THE FUTURE RESIDENTS OF THE DEVELOPMENT THINKING THAT PERHAPS THEY WOULD FEEL UNWANTED. IF THEY MOVE IN AND THAT STREET IS ALREADY CLOSED, IT'LREADY GATED, HOW AREY GOING TO KNOW THAT? I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE THERE, THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD NOW. IF ALL. A SUDDEN THERE'S MORE TRAFFIC IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD, THEY WANT TO SELL THEIR HOUSE, WHAT BEFORE THOSE PEOPLE? WHAT ABOUT IF THEY HAVE KIDS AND KIDS WANT TO STAY IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD? I RESPECTFULLY WOULD JUST ASK THAT YOU WOULD HOLD OFF ON ANY BIG DECISIONS. THINK ABOUT IF IT WAS YOUR KID, YOUR GRANDKID IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD. PUT YOURSELF WHERE THEY LIVE NOW. THANK Y

02:18:22.528: >> HI. THIS IS R ROSEMARY. I LIVE AT 3550 [INDISCERNIBLE] ROAD. I'VE LIVED HERE 35 YEARS. I'M CONCERNEDUT THE IGHTDAITE PLAN AND IN PARTICULAR THE OPENING OFLY. I'VE RAISED ALL MY CHILDREN HERE. THEY'VE ALL WALKED TO THE POOL FOR SWIM TEAM. I'M SYMPATHETIC TO THE CONCERNS OF THE PARENTS REGARDING CHILDREN IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD. THIS IS A WELL INTEGRATED NEIGHBORHOOD, RACIALLY, ECONOMICALLY, AND CULTURALLY. AND NEIGHBORHOODS KNOW EACH OTHER. WE BIKE AND PEDESTRIANS TRAFFIC IS VERY COMMON. CHILDREN WALK TO THE SCHOOL AND TO OUR NEIGHBORHOOD POOL. THIS IS HOW WE COME YES A COMMUNITY -- COALESCE AS A COMMUNITY. OURS IS THE KIND OF NEIGHBORHOOD THE COUNCIL SHOULD BE TRYINTO FOSTER. OURS IS A COMMUNITY THAT'S WORKING. WHAT IS THREATENING TO THESE NEIGHBORHOOD TIES IS CARS. YOU COULD JUST ASK THE JOHNSTONS OR THE LACRONES. I SPOKE TO BOTH OF THEM TODAY AND THEY ARE VERY CONCERNED. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVEN'T SEEN IT ELY IS A SHORT S-SHAPED ROAD WITH SEVERAL BLIND SPOTS AS YOU TRAVEL TOWARDS YOST. HOW COULD WE SEND OUR CHILDREN TO WALK THE COUPLE OF BLOCKS TO QU CUL-DE-SAC IS CHANGED A THAT THOROUGHFARE. ELY IS THE STREET YOU HAVE TO CROSS. THE ORIGINAL REZONING TO KEEP ELY CLOSED EXCEPT FOR EMERGENCY VEHICLES WHY WOULD IT HAVE TO BE OPENED NOW? DO VALUE STREET CONNECTIVITY OVER THE SAFETY? SOME OF US STARTING TO WONDER IF CONNECTIVITY IS A PRIORITY OVER PUBLIC SAFETY, I CAN ONLY IMAGINE THE IMPORTANTLY LIABILITY THE CITY BO FACE IF, GOD FORBID TRAPENED. NOT YOU HAVEN'T BEEN WARNED. YOU'VE BEEN WNED REPEATEDLY. IF PEDESTRIANS AND BICYCLE SAFETY TRULY ARE GOALS FOR THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR, PLEASE KEEP ELY CLOSED TO THROUGH-TRAFFIC EXCEPT FOR EMERGENCIES. DON'T THE RESIDENTS DESERVE AT LEAST THAT MUCH CONSIDERATION FROM YOU AS THE GUARDIANS. CITY PUBLIC SAFETY? I URGE YOU TO APPROVE THIS SITE PLAN ONLY WITH A PROVISION TO KEEP ELY CLOSED. I THANK YOU FOR LISTENING AND

02:21:00.252: >> Clerk Beaudry:  CALLER 677, PHONE ENDING IN 677, DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT?
02:21:09.795: >> HI. I JUST WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT WE'VE ABEEN HEARING FROM A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE AFRAID CARS AND HOWGEROUS CARS ARE. I THINK THAT'S A VERY APPROPRIATE THING FOR EVERYONE TO BE AFRAID OF. CARS ARE VERY DANGEROUS ON OUR STREETS. WE ALL WANT TO HAVE STREETS THAT WE CAN FEEL SAFE WALKING ON, BIKING ON THAT WE CAN FEEL SAFE HAVING OUR KIDS PLAY ON. FOR EVEN ADULTS TO PLAY ON. SO I HOPE THAT THESE IDEAS GUIDE LICY VISIONS IN THE FUTURE. EVEN IF THE SPECIFIC INTERVENTIONS SUGGESTED TONIGHT, IF YOU DON'T THINK THOSE ARE THE SPECIFIC ONES WARRANTED HERE, I HOPE IN GENERAL, IN THE FUTURE, WE FOCUS ON BUILDING A CITY THAT KEEPS US SAFE FROM THE DANGERS POSED BY CARS AND THAT THIS CAN BE A CITY FRIENDLY TO WALKING, BIKING, PETS, A GOOD TIME AND NT HAVING TO FEAROR YOUR LIFE. THANK YOU.
02:22:27.840: >> Mayor Taylor:  THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING? SEEING NO ONE THIS PUBLIC SHEARING CLOSED. I DON'T -- PUBLIC HEARINGS NO. 6 AND 7 HAVE BEEN PULLED. IS THAT CORRECT?
02:22:50.763: >> Clerk Beaudry:  THAT'S T.THE PUBLIC HEARINGS ON THESE O ITEMS WERE PREVIOUSLY HELD.
02:22:56.435: >> Mayor Taylor:  SO THESE -- SO THEIR INCLUSION ON THE AGENDA IS AN ERROR. WE DON'T NEED TO OMIT THEM. IS THAT RIGHT?
02:23:06.278: >> Clerk Beaudry:  CORRECT.
02:23:08.013: >> Mayor Taylor:  OK. THANK YOU. SO WE CAN AT LEAST TAKE A VOTE ON SOMETHING BEFORE WE GO. WE HAVE BEFORE US THE SPECIAL SESSION UNITS OCTOBER 15 AND 16 AND THE REGULAR SESSION MEETING MO APPROVE?NOVEMR 16, 2 MOD  COUNCIL MEMBER NELSON, SECONDED BY GRISWOLD. DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR?

02:34:28.793: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANKS, MR. MAYOR. I THINK WE ALL RECEIVED ONE INTERESTING E-MAIL SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE SIGN ORDINANCE FROM MR. WESTPHAL. IT WAS A CURIOUS CE OF HE AND I BEING ON THE SAME PAGE ABOUT MANY THINGS. MANY OF THE QUESTIONS THAT HE HAD WERE THE SAME QUESTIONS THAT I HAD. I HOPE EVERYBODY GOT A CHANCE TO LOOK AT THE ANSWER THAT WERE SENT AROUND TO EVERYBODY. FROM MY SET OF QUESTIONS FROM OCTOBER. I FOUND MYSELF DISSATISFYING BY SOME. IPATHETIC TO SOME OF THE COMMENTS, TEORARY SIGNAGE, REAL ESTATE SIGNS, BEST PRACTICES AND THE SURVEY. I DON'T KNOW WHAT MY SOLUTION IS OTHER THAN TO SAY NO TO THIS. AS ALSO SAID IN COMMENTS, IT'S A STRANGE TIME TO BE STRENGTHENING OUR SIGN ORDINANCE. I UNDERSTAND THERE'S SOME CONCERNS THAT THE OLD ONE WASN'T IN KEEPING WITH CERTAIN COURT ACTION THAT HAVE COME RECENTLY. BUT I'M VERY DISSATISFIED WITH SOME OF THE WAYS THE SIGNS A HANDLED. I'M NOT SURE IF MY COLLEAGUES WOULD BE INTERESTED IN SENDING IT BACK TO STAFF FOR CHANGES OR MODIFICATIONS ON THE FLY. I'M NOT SATISFIED WITH THE WAY IT SITS BEFORE US AND THE ANSWER THAT I GOT AND I'M NOT GOING TO SUPPORT IT. I WANTED TO SHARE THAT WITH EVERYONE.
02:35:59.551: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS?
02:36:04.089: >> THANKS. I WAS SERVING ON THE PLANNING COMMISSION WHEN THIS WAS DISCUSSED FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. I KNOW THAT A GREAT DEAL OF WORK WENT INTO THIS IN TERMS OF TRYING TO BALANCE ALL THE VARIETY OF NEEDS FROM DESIRES THAT I VOICED FOR LESS SIGNAGE, A LOT OF CONSIDERATION AROUND LIGHTING AND LARGE SIGNAGE AS WELL AS SORT OF THE OBVIOUS NEEDS THAT WE HAVE IN OUR COMMUNITY FOR SIGNAGE. SO, I THINK STAFF HAS DONE A REALLY GREAT JOB TRYING TO BALANCE THOSE NEEDS AND ALSO RECOGNIZING THAT WRE JUST IN A REALLY CHALLENGING TIME PERIOD, PARTICULARLY WITH SIGN LAW. THE REASON OUR ORDINANCE WAS UPDATED, AS MANY KNOW, IS BECAUSE OF THE REID V. TOWN OF GILBERT CASE IN 2015 WHICH REQUIRES CONSENT NEUTRALITY IN OUR SIGN ORDINANCES SO TO THE SPEAKER'S COMMENTS, HE WAS ASKING WHY THERE ISN'T SORT OF MORE FLEXIBILITY WITH BUSINESS SIGNS AND WHY WE'RE LIMITED TO JUST SIX POLITICAL SIG IT'S EASY FOR ME TO SAY SOMEBODY SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE AS MUCH POLITICAL SIGNS AS THEY WANT IN THEIR FRONT YARD BUT WHEN YOU BY THIS WHETHER OR NOT WOULD WANT EACH OF THOSE SIGNS TO POTENTIALLY HAVE A COMMERCIAL MESSAGE IN THE FRONT YARD OF SOMEBODY'S HOUSE THAT WOULD ALSO BE PERMISSIBLE AS WELL. SO, THERE'S JUST A LOT OF ASPECTS WE NEED TO BALANCE IN THIS. THERE'S BEEN SOMEONE FORTUNATE RULINGS ON THE 6TH CIRCUIT THAT ARE BEGINNING TO MAKE ITDIFFTO N COMMERCIAL AND NON-COMMEIAL SIGNAGE IN TERMS OF CON TINT NEUTRALITY. SO, WE'RE IN A REALLY PARTICULARLY STICKY PLACE IN THE 6TH CIRCUIT. I KNOW THAT STAFF HAS BEEN VING TO WRESTLE WITH THAT IN THE LEGAL DEPARTMENT. I THINK THAT THIS IS A PRETTY PROGRESSIVE SIGN ORDINANCE BECAUSE THAT WHAT I DO FOR MY DAY B IN TERMS OF HOW WE COMMUNITS.AGNST OTHER I'M FULLYUPPORTIVE OF IT. THOUGH I RECOGNIZE TRE ARE CHANGETHAT I WLD LOV TO MA, TOO, BUT IT'S AALANCE.
02:38:19.357: >> Mor Taylor:  FURTHER DIUSSION? ROLL CL -- I SORRYIS THAT U AGAIN
02:38:33.538: >> Councmember Hayne JUST BRIEFLY RESPOND TO CNCILWOMAN THERS CHANG, I RECOGNIZE MAKE. CHANGE I WLD LIK T WHAT IS THE PROCESS WHERE BY WE CAN KE THESE CHANGES IN RESPONSE TO THE COMMUNITY CONCERNS AND PERSONAL CONCES ABOUT THE FREE SPEECH ASPECTS? WITHOUT SENDING IT BACK -- MOVING TO SEND IT BACK TO PLANNING, WHICH I DON'T EXPECT THAT SUPPORT FROM THIS BODY. BUT, YOU KNOW, WOULD IT JUST BE ODD ORDINANCE REVISION? WOULD IT HAVE TO COME BACK THROUGH PLANNING? WHAT'S THE PROCESS IN WHICH SMALL CHANGES COULD BE MADE? AS MR. WESTPHAL POINTED OUT AND OTHERS, WE'RE CODIFYING -- WE'RE MAKING A WHOLE CLASS OF TEMPORARY SIGNS, FULULTIME AS AN EXAMPLE ON THESE RENTAL PROPERTIES. I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE INTENT. I DON'T THINK THAT WAS THE GOAL OF THIS. I DON'T THINK WE WANTED TO MAKE PERMANENT TEMPORARY SIGNS AND SO ON. THAT'S BUT ONE THING THAT IS WRONG WITH THIS. SO WHAT'S THE PROCESS? IF WE CAN JUST SAY YES TO THIS NOW AND COME BACK AND PICK AWAY AT IT ONE PIECE AT A TIME? DO WE FEEL IT NEEDS TO BE TREATED HOLISTICALLY?
02:39:46.978: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS?
02:39:51.649: >> Councilman Bannister:  I THINK --
02:39:55.153: >> I THINK HE CAN SPEAK TO THAT BETTER THAN I CAN. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, IT'S PRETTY IMPORTANT THAT WE PASS THE SIGN ORDINANCE TONIGHT. WE NEED TO BE COMPLIANT WITH REED V. TOWN OF GILBERT. THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR OUR COMMUNITY. IT'S A FAIRLY -- IT'S A STRONG SIGN ORDINANCE. WE DISCUSSED THE EXACT ISSUES THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AND FORMER COUNCILMEMBER WESTPHAL DID AND WRESTLED WITH IT AND WENT BACK F BETWEEN ORDINANCE REVISION COMMITTEE AND PLANNING WORKING SESSION. IT BOUNCED BACK AND FORTH ON THIS ISSUE FOR QUITE A BIT. WE LIVE IN A CHALLENGING COMMUNITY WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH OF OUR REAL ESTATE IS CONSTANTLY UP FOR RENEWAL, FOR LEASE. SO, THINKING ABOUT THE LEGITIMATE NEEDS ABOUT HAVING A SIGNPOST THERE HAD, VERSUS THE CHALLENGES FOR SOME NEIGHBORHOODS OR SOME COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES THAT MIGHT CONSISTENTLY BE THERE THEY'RE REALLY CHALLENGING FOR US TO BE ABLE TO BALANCE THAT. MY PREFERENCE, I GUESS, FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IS -- WITH RESPECT TO THE PLANNING IS TO PASS THIS TONIGHT AND IF THERE ARE PIECE THAT WE'RE MOVING FORWARD AND WE CAN SEE ARE REALLY CHALLENGES THAT NEED TO BE WORKED UPON, LITTLE FLAWS THAT WE SIT DOWN AND SEE IF WE CAN DO IT BETTER ON THOSE AND WORK THROUGH AN ORDINANCE REVISION ON THAT WHILE WE WRESTLE WITH THE REALLY TINY ISSUES. YEAH.
02:41:27.245: >> Mayor Taylor:  IT WOULD BE A QUESTION FOR MR. LAIN YERT OR MR. FROST, IF I MAY, JUST A BRIEF ONE.
02:41:34.118: >> GOOD EVENING. I'M THE PLANNING MANAGER. YOU COULD APPROACH IT IN NUMEROUS WAYS. COME MAKE MODIFICATIONS NOW, MAKE ANY ADJUSTMENTS DESIRED. YOU COULD CERTAINLY REFER US TO INVESTIGATE AND FOLLOW-UP WITH YOU WITH ANY SORT OF SPECIFIC AREAS THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO EXPLORE FURTHER. I WOULD AGREE WITH COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS THAT I THINK -- I RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS A NEW APPROACH FOR SIGN REGULATION IN OUR COMMUNITY. AND THAT COMES OUT OF NECESSITY FROM SOME OF THE SORT OF LANDSCAPE THAT COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS REFERENCED. I DO BELIEVE THAT THE ORDINANCE THAT HAS BEEN PRESENTED FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION PROVIDES A STRUCTURE WHERE NOT UNLIKE THE [INDISCERNIBLE], I THINK THAT THE FOUNDATIONS THERE IS RIGHT BUT IN THE FUTURE IF WE DO WANT TO MAKE THOSE ADJUSTMENTS, FOR EXAMPLE,O THE NUMBER OF TEMPORARY SIGNS AND THE LIKE, WE HAVE A RELATIVELY EASY STRUCTURE TO REVISIT SOME OF THOSE THINGS. BUT ULTIMATELY I THINK IT COULD BE APPROACHED IN A COUPLE OF WAYS.
02:42:41.552: >> WILL THERE BE ANY ENFORCEMENT ONCE IT'S IN PLACE? I THINK WE SAW IT WAS SIMPLE THIS YEAR IN A HEAVILY SEEN, FEDERAL AND STATE AND LOCAL ELECTION THAT -- I MEAN, THERE WAS A DOZEN H THAT HAD MORE THAN SIXARD SIGNS. ARE WE REALLY GOING TO ENFORCE THIS MOVING FORWARD? I WOULDN'T THINK WE HAD THE WHEREWITHAL OR THE STAFFING TO ENFORCE THIS ONCE THIS IS WRITTEN TONIGHT AS A LATER AGENDA ITEM SUGGESTS. WILL WE REALLY BE ENFORCING THIS IF SOMEBODY IS ABLE TO DROP A DIME ON THEIR NEIGHBOR FOR HAVING SEVEN YARD SIGNS? AND WILL THE CITY RESPOND?
02:43:19.490: >> I DON'T THINK THAT FRAMEWORK WOULD CHANGE FROM WHAT WE HAVE NOW. WE DON'T HAVE MULTI-SHIFTED ORDINANCE ENFORCEMENT NOW. SO AS IT IS NOW, I DON'T HAVE PEOPLE PROACTIVELY OUT IN THE COMMUNITY SORT OF POLICING FOR SIGN ORDINANCE. LIKE A LOT OF OTHER ORDINANCE SORT OF ENFORCEMENT, AT TIMES IT IS COMPLAINT DRIVEN. SIGNAGE IS PART OF THAT AS WELL. SO, THIS IS A BIG TOPIC OF CONVERSATION AS WELL AT THE PLANNING COMMISSION AS WELL. YOU'LL NOTE THAT TEMPORARY SIGN PERMITS -- TEMPORARY SIGNS ARE NOT PROPOSED TO REQUIRE PERMITS. THAT WAS A BALANCE O FINDING AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL IF IT'S DESIRED FOR SOMEBODY TO PUT A POLITICAL SIGN IN THEIR YARD OR ON ANY PROPERTY, I THINK THAT THERE WAS A RECOGNITION THAT REQUIRING A PERMIT MIGHT BE A HIGH LEVEL OF COMPLIANCE FOR THAT. NONETHELESS, THE REQUIREMENT STILL EXISTS. HOW WE WOULD ENFORCE IT IF IT WAS BROUGHT TO OUR INTENTION THAT WE NEEDED TO INVESTIGATE WE WOULD MEASURE AND INVESTIGATE THE PROPERTY TO ASCERTAIN WHAT SIGNAGE DISPLAY IS OCCURRING. WE WOULD DO OUR BEST TO MEASUTHT WAS COMPLIANT OR NOT, AND TAKE ANY ACTIONS. BUT TO YOUR POINT, NO, WE DON'T HAVE ACTIVE SIGN ORDINANCE ENFORCEMENT. BUT THIS IS AN ORDINANCE LIKE OTHER ONE THAT ULTIMATELY WE CAN HOLD PROPERTY OWNERS ACCOUNTABLE TO.
02:44:45.877: >> THE OTHER CONCERN I HAD WAS HOW WAS IT THAT THINGS ARE CLEARLY SIGNS ADVERTISING EITHER COMMERCIAL OR NONPROFIT ADVERTISING WERE LEFT OUT OF THIS LIKE AS AN EXAMPLE, LIKE THE SIGNS ON THE SIDES OF THE BUSES ADVERTISING ON THOSEBUSES, VEHICLE WRAPS, BIKES AND THINGS LIKE THAT? YOU HAVE LIGHTED MOVING SIGNAGE. I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT WE QUASH THAT SPEECH IN ANY WAY. I JUST WONDER HOW WE WOULD MAYBE ADD THAT IN OR IF THAT WAS PURPOSEFULLY LEFT OUT AND IF SO, WHAT WAS THE REASON FOR THAT?
02:45:18.576: >> IT WAS NOT INCLUDED BECAUSE BY ITS NATURE THE SIGN ORDINANCE IS PART OF OUR UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE WHICH REGULATES SIGNAGE ON PRIVATE PROPERTY. SO IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT YOU OUTLINE, THOSE ARE HAPPENING IN TXT OF ACTUALLY OUR TRANSPORTATION BR NETWORK. IT'S NOT IS TAYE THAT THE CITY COULDN'T TAKE STEPS TO DETERMINE HOW THEY WOULD DESIRE TO REGULATE THOSE. HOWEVER, THE SAME STANDARDS THAT WOULD APPLY TO PRIVATE PROPERTY WOULD NOT NECESSARILY APPLY TO SOME VEHICLES OPERATED.
02:45:48.072: >> SO LIKE THE FLAT BED TRUCKS WITH THE BIG SIGNS THAT GO AROUND ALL DAY ORING? LIKE THAT, YOU WOULDN'T TOUCH THAT?
02:45:55.413: >> YEAH. THIS IS A REGULATION OF SIGNAGE ON PRIVATE PROPERTY.
02:45:58.816: >> RIGHT. I UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR AN APPROACH TO BE ROOTED IN SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT I THINK -- IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THAT THESE OTHER TYPES OF SIGNS ARE CAUSING ANY GREAT HAZARD. BUT IT'S UNUSUAL OUR NEED TO BE ROOTED IN A CERTAIN TYPE LIKE THE DEVELOPMENT CODE HAS EXCLUDED ENTIRE CLASSES OF SIGNS. THAT'S ALL. I JUST WANTED TO MAKE THAT COMMENT. THANK YOU.
02:46:23.007: >> Mayor Taylor:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER. NO.
02:46:34.285: >> Clerk Beaudry:  DISCH?
02:46:36.153: >> YES.

02:46:46.464: >> MAYOR TAYLOR?
02:46:47.865: >> YES.
02:46:50.735: >> Clerk Beaudry: COUNCILMEMBER AYER?
02:46:53.204: >> YES.
02:46:53.904: >> NELSON?
02:46:54.872: >> YES.
02:46:55.206: >> BRIGGS?
02:46:56.741: >> YES.

02:47:00.745: >> YES.
02:47:01.212: >> MOTION CARRIES.
02:47:03.047: >> Mayor Taylor:  RESOLUTION TO APPROVE 3411 GEDDES ROAD ANNEXATION. [NO AUDIBLE RESPONSE] ALL IN FAVOR?
02:47:30.341: >> AYE.
02:47:31.175: >> OPPOSED?
02:47:32.043: >> APPROVED. B1 ORDINANCE T APPROVE THE 3411GEDDES ROAD ANNEXATION MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD, SECONDED. DISCUSSION PLEASE? ALL IN FAVOR?
02:47:54.165: >> AYE.
02:47:55.332: >> Mayor Taylor:  OPPOSED? APPROVED. DB2. [READING RESOLUTION] MOVED. SECONDED. DISCUSSION, PLEASE. [NO AUDIBLE RESPONSE] ALL IN FAVOR? I'M SORRY. COUNCILMEMBER DISCH?
02:48:24.261: >> A MINOR QUESTION. I'M SORRY I DIDN'T SUBMIT IT AS AN AGENDA QUESTION BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S WHERE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN APPROPRIATE. BUT I WONDERED IF WE WERE -- I WAS PUZZLED BY AND INTERESTED IN THE LETT THAT WE RECEIVED FROM LINDA YOUNG ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT THIS ANNEXATION IS BEING MOTIVATED BY THEM ADDING A PRESCHOOL. SO, ARE WE ASSUMING -- ARE WE THINKING THAT THEY MIGHT WANT TO ADD BUILDINGS FOR A NURSERY SCHOOL? I'M NOT SAYING THIS BECAUSE I THINK THAT WOULD BE A BAD THING. I THINK THOSE ARE SERVICES WE NEED. BUT I'M JUST SAYING THAT THIS REQUEST TO ME.IT OF A PUZZLING
02:49:08.873: >> Mayor Taylor:  ANY VISIBILITY ON THIS?
02:49:13.244: >> GOOD EVENING AGAIN. SO, WE ARE NOT AWARE OF ANY IMMEDIATE PLANS TO EXPAND, PHYSICALLY EXPAND, THEIR PROPERTY. IT IS NOTABLE, HOWEVER THAT UNDER BOTH I THINK THE CURRENT JURISDICTION AND IF ANNEX INTO THE CITY THE USE WOULD REQUIRE A SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE PERMIT. XATION IS APPROVED, ANYEM IF THE EXPANSION OF THAT PROPERTYOULD NOT ONLY HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE SITE PLAN REVIEW PROCESS BUT ALSO WOULD HAVE TO RECEIVE A SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE PERMIT AS WELL. SO IN SHORT, I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY IMMEDIATE PLANS FOR AN EXPANSION. IF ANNEXED IT WOULD HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE REVIEW PROCESS BEFORE [AWAY FROM MICROPHONE]
02:50:03.661: >> YES.r Taylor:  MR. CHENG? I WAS THE PLANNERNHIS PROJECT. I DID HAVE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE PETITIONER. THEY JUST WANTED TO ADD THAT THEY ALSO HAVE A HIGHCHOOL THAT'S ALRDY IN THE CITY. THEY ARE ALREADY HOOKED UP TO CITY ULITY. SO THEY WANTED TO JOI TIR ELEMENTARY/MIDDLE SCHOO ALONG WITH THEIR HIGSCHOOL BEING IN THCITY OF ANN ARBOR. ALL IN FAV?SSION?HANK YOU.
02:50:37.061: >> AYE
02:50:37.328: >> Mayor Taylo  OPPED APPROVED. DB3. SECONDED AS A SHARED EARLIER TODAY, I PLAN TO COVER AN AMENDMENT TO THIS RESOLUTION TONIGHT I WANT TO THANK ALL OF THE RESIDENTS POO WHO CALLED IN AND SHARED THEIR CONCERNS WITH US. I HAD THE EXISTING PUBLIC SAFETY CONCERN -- PEDESTRIAN SAFETY CONCERNS IN THIS AREA THAT I THINK COULD POTENTIALLY BE EXACERBATED BY CONNECTING ELY ROAD TO BURTON ROAD AT THIS TIME. FOR THOSE OF YOU UNFAMILIAR WITH THE AREA, SEVERAL OF YOU HAVE GONE OUT AND TOURED THE AREA YOURSELVES, BUT THERE IS SIGNIFICANT SIDEWALK GAPS, SPECIFICALLY IN A COUPLE OF KEY AREAS, ONE BEING AROUND THE COMMUNITY POOL WHICH IS HEAVILY TRAFFICKED BY CHILDREN IN THE SUMMER MONTHS, AND THEN ALSO ALONG YOST BOULEVARD AS IT CROSSES OVER SWIFT DRAIN WHICH IS THE PRIMARY ROUTE TO SCHOOL FROM THIS NEIGHBORHOOD TO THE PITTSFIELD ELEMENTSRY. SO IT FORCES PEOPLE OUT INTO THE STREET WHILE CROSSING THE CREEK AND THEN CONTINUES AGAIN ON THE OTHER SIDE. SO, I AM HOPING TO OFFER WHAT WILL POTENTIALLY BE A COMPROMISED SOLUTION TONIGHT THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR THE COMPLETION OF THE CONNECTION AS PROPOSED IN THE SITE PLAN BUT WOULD ULTIMATELY ADD A GATE AND LOCK AT THAT LOCATION SO THAT WE CAN LIMIT THE TRAFFIC CURRENTLY TO EMERGENCY VEHICLES AND ALLOW FOR THE CONTINUED ACCESS THAT EXISTS NOW FOR BICYCLISTS AND PEDESTRIANS BUT WOULD ALSO INCLUDE A CLAUSE THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR THAT TO EVENTUALLY BE OPENED AT A FUTURE DATE SHOULD E ABLE TO -- MY HOPE WOULD BE SHOULD WE BE ABLE TO AGGRESS SOME OF THE PEDESTRIAN SAFETY -- ADDRESS SOME OF THE PEDESTRIAN SAFETY CONCERNS, ENACT CALMING MEASURES, AND HOPEFULLY USE THIS AS POTENTIALLY A MODEL NEIGHBORHOOD FOR US TO LOOK AT WAYS THAT WE CAN BEST CONNECT OUR NEIGHBORHOODS BY ALL MEANS OF TRANSIT AND NOT JUST VEHICLE TRAFFIC. I HAVE RESUBMITTED THAT TO THE CLERK. I THINK SHE HAS SENT THAT AROUND. IT WOULD ADD A FINAL CLAUSE TO THLAST RESOL THAT IT WOULD READ AFTER SATISFIED AND THAT THE SITE PLAN AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT IS MODIFY SOD THAT THE ACCESS TO BURTON ROAD FROM ELY ROAD INCLUDES GATES AND LOCKS THAT WOULD LIMIT STREET ACCESS TO EMERGENCY VEHICLES AND THAT SUCH GATES AND LOCKS COULD BE CLOSE ENCLOSED OR LATER REMOVED BY THE CITY THROUGH AT PROSECUTORRIVE ACTION OR THE USE OF A TRAFFIC CONTROL ORDER AS APPLICABLE. I ALSO JUST --
02:53:35.506: >> Mayor Taylor:  SORRY THERE A SECOND? SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
02:53:42.379: >> I ALSO WANAN BRIEF THANK STAFF FOR ALL OF THEIR WORK THAT I'VE PUT THEM THROUGH OVER THE WEEKEND TO WORK ON THIS. I WANT TO PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY. I DO BELIEVE THIS MAY STILL NOT NECESSARILY BE THE RECOMMENDATION THAT STAFF WOULD PROPOSE. SO I WANT TO GIVE MR. LENART AN OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT AS WELL IF HE WOULD LIKE TO DO SO.
02:54:10.007: >> THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER. THE STAFF AND PLANNING COMMISSION'S REVIEW AS PRESENTED. WE BELIEVE THE FULL CONNECTION TO ELY ROAD IS PREFERABLE FOR AN INTERCONNECTED NEIGHBORHOOD, MORE ACCESSIBLE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM IT IMPROVES EXCESS FOR CITY SERVICES, PARTICULARLY EXISTING ELY ROAD DEAD END. NONETHELESS STAND WILLING TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE. COUNCILMEMBER: AND LASTLY -- I DO STILL -- LASTLY, I WILL ALSO JUST ADD THAT MY INTENTION IN THIS AND WHAT I APPRECIATE STAFF BEING ABLE TO WORK WITH ME ON IS I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO INTENTION OF DELAYING OR PREVENTING WHAT IS OTHERWISE A BY RIGHT DEVELOPMENT TO BE APPROVED TONIGHT. THIS IS SOMETHING I THINK THE DEVELOPER HAS WORKED VERY WELL WITH THE CITY IN MAKINGURE THAT NOT ONLY ARE THEY DOING EVERYTHI THAT THEY SHOULD BUT THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY PROVIDING SOME BENEFITS BACK TO THE CITY THROUGH THIS APPROVAL TONIGHT. I HAVE NO INTENTION OF DELAYING THAT ANYMORE FOR A PROJECT THAT I THINK HAS HAD SIGNIFICANT PATIENCE THROUGH THE THIS PROCESS. I HOPE YOU'LL CONSIDER THIS AMENDMENT AND SUPPORT IT TONIGHT. THANKS.
02:55:39.263: >> Mayor Taylor:  THE AMENDMENT FRIENDLY TO THE BODY? COUNCIEMBER BRIGGS? I'M SORRY. I GOT HAYNER AND RAMLAWI ON THE QUEUE. IF IT'S FRIENDLY -- IT'S NOT FRIENDLY. CARRY ON. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
02:56:04.855: >> THANK YOU, MAYOR. THANK YOU TO STAFF AND COUNCIL MEMBERS IN THE 3RD WARD WHO HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE NEIGHBORS ON THIS. WE'VE BEEN GETTING DOZENS OF E-MAILS TODAY AS WE ALL KNOW AND HEARD THROUGH THE PUBLICHEARING. THE ISSUES THAT ARE COMMON THROUGH THE ALL OF THOSE E-MAILS. ONLY REASON I'M SAYING IT'S NOT FRIENDLY IS I WANT FURTHER CLARIFICATION ON THIS BEFORE APPROVING IT. IF ANYBODY CAN ANSWER A COUPLE OF QUICK QUESTIONS. AND THAT IS, DO WE HAVE AN ARRANGEMENT LIKE THIS ANYWHERE ELSE? OUR CITY? -- ELSE IN OUR CITY? DO WE HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH THIS TYPE OF ARRANGEMENT? HAS IT BEEN APPLIED ANYWHERE ELSE?
02:56:48.198: >> I DON'T HAVE A L LT BUT, YES, THE SHORT ANSWER IS WE HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH THESE TYPES OF CONFIGURATIONS IN OTHER DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS.
02:57:00.010: >> Councilman Ramlawi:  AND WHO OWNS THE LOCK AND KEY AND HOW DO EMERGENCY VEHICLES RESPOND TO INSTANCES WITH THAT IN PLACE? HOW DOES THAT WORK IF SOMEONE CAN REAL QUICKLY DESCRIBE IT.
02:57:17.494: >> I CAN'T DESCRIBE IT IN DETAIS DESIGNED IN SUCH A WAY THAT EMERGENCY ACCESS SUCH AS OUR FIRE DEPARTMENT WOULD HAVE A COMMON ACCESS. IT'S CALLED A NOX BOX. IT IS A VERY SPECIFIC MECHANISM THAT THEY WILL HAVE QUICK ACCESS TO. IN SHORT, I THINK IT'S A KEY. IT GIVES THEM THE ABILITY TO PHYSICALLY OPEN THAT GATE WHEN EMERGENCY ACCESS IS NECESSARY. AGAIN, I CAN'T SPEAK WITH A LOT OF DETAIL AS TO THE FIRE OPERATIONS. BUT FURTHERMORE, THIS REQUIRES TWO MEANS OF EMERGENCY ACCESS. SO, THEY WOULD, OF COURSE, ALSO HAVE THE BURTON ROAD ACCESS. THIS WOULD PROVIDE A SECONDARY MEAN AS WELL.
02:58:06.109: >> Councilman Ramlawi:  HAVE THESE TYPES OF INSTALLATIONS THAT ARE BEING IN THIS CASE BY COUNCILMEMBER RADINA PROPOSING THAT THIS BE MORE OF A TEMPORARY SOLUTION AND THAT WE WOULD LIKE A LONG-TERMEPLACEMENT? I KNOW THAT NOT IN THIS CASE BUT OTHER CASES IN THE 5TH WARD ESPECIALLY THERE WAS ONE WHERE QUESTIONS OF EQUITY WERE RAISED AND HOW WE ALLOW MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY TO GET FROM ONE PART OF OUR CITY TO ANOTHER OR ONE PART OF OUR NEIGHBORHOOD TO ANOTHER AND WE DON'T HAVE GATED PRIVATE COMMUNITIES AND THE EQUITY ISSUES THAT ARISE WITH THIS TYPE OF ARRANGEMENT. THAT IS ONE CONCERN I HAVE. I APPRECIATE THE EFFOR THAT ARE BEING MADE. I KNOW THESE -- THIS ENABLED HAS GONE THROUGH A LOT AND HAS ACCEPTED THIS DEVELOPMENT AS BEING INEVITABLE AND LOOKING FOR IT TO BE APPROVED. SO BACK TO MY QUESTION, HAVE WE EVER MIGRATED FROM SOMETHING THAT WAS TEMPORARY? AND WHAT WOULD A PERMANENT [INDISCERNIBLE] PERHAPS COULD BE ANSWERED AT A TIME LIKE RIGHT NOW?
02:59:27.324: >> AGAIN, I DON'T HAVE AN EXAMPLE OF SPSKLY WHERE WE STARTED WITH A -- SPECIFICALLY OF WHERE WE STARTED WITH AN EMERGENCY ACCESS AND IT WENT TO A FULL ACCESS. I THINK THE PROCESS WOULD BE AS THE PROPOSED LANGUAGE WOULD BE IT WOULD ALLOW THE CITY THROUGH A FAIRLY TYPYPICAL TRAFFIC CONTR WHERE WE WOULD MAINTAIN OR REMOVE OR OPEN THAT GATE. I THINK IT'S AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF -- WE HEARD A LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT EXISTING CONDITIONS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. FROM A STAFF PERSPECTIVE, WE DON'T INHERENTLY BELIEVE THAT THE CONNECTION, THIS CONNECTION FROM BURTON TO ELY CHANGES THOSE CONCERNS. IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE CONFIGURATION OF THAT FROM SAFE TO UNSAFE. BUT THIS KINDFACH PROVIDES THE OPPORTUNITY SHOD KNOWS FURTHER IN MORE DETAILED ANALYSIS HAPPEN ON THE LARGER NEIGHBORHOOD NETWORK IT MIGHT OPEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO REVISIT IF SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS ARE ADDRESSED SATISFACTORILY.
03:00:41.765: >> Councilman Ramlawi: THANK YOU.
03:00:44.000: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER?
03:00:45.535: >> THANKS FOR KEEPING ME IN THE LOOP ON THIS I WAS INTERESTED BY IT BEFORE. I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS AMENDMENT. I'VE ACTUALLY -- I'VE WORKED ON BUILDINGS AND THAT HAVE A NOX BOX. MY UNDERSTANDI IS E FIRE DEPARTMENT HAS A SINGLE MASTER KEY AND INSIDE THE BOMB IS A SPECIFIC KEY TO THAT SPECIFIC LOCK OR THAT PORTION OF THE BUILDING OR SEVERAL PORTIONS OF THE BUILDING OR THE FIRE PANEL OR WHATEVER IS NECESSARY. SO I ASSUME IT'S GOING TO WORK LIKE THAT. AND IT WORKS. THAT ASIDE, I GUESS MY ONLY QUESTION IS IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT COMPLETING THE GRID THEN [INDISCERNIBLE] WOULD ALSO BE CONNECTED TO BURTON. I DON'T THINK THAT WOULD BE ANY BETTER THAN THIS. IT MAY BE WORSE. I'M SUPPORTIVE OF THIS EFFORT. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE STREET WILL BE MADE TO BE A CONNECTION WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THIS GATED AND SIDEWALKS WILL BE CONNECTED. IS THERE A MECHANISM BY WHICH COUNCIL CAN ENCOURAGE THE MOVING UP ON OUR PRIORITIES LIST OFHE SIDEWALK ON THE MISSING SIDEWALK BY THE FOREST BROOK CORNER AND DOWN YOST? I GUESS YOU CALL IT SHORT OF THE NORTHEAST SIDE OF YOST. MY OTHER QUESTION WOULD BE THAT OVER THE [INDISCERNIBLE] IS THE PARK, A CITY PARK THERE. JUST A LITTLE BIT NORTHEAST AGAIN OF THE RD IS A SORT OF A FOOTH, ARIDGE,. ARE WE LAX IN NOT HAVING CONTINUED ACCESS THROUGH OUR PARK THERE? IS THA SOMETHING THAT W NEED TO PUT I FRONT OF PAC TO MAKE SURE THAT W KEEP UP OUR END OF TINGHHERE? AT'S JUST A THE QUEIONS I HAVE ABO MOVIN FORWARD WITH FIING THESEIDEWALK GAPS TO MAKE PEDESIAN AND POTENALLY CYING ACCESS MORE CONNEED WITH THIS DEVELMENT SO KIDS CAN T T SCHOOFOR THEIR BUS CKUPS ANDO ON? I'M NOT SUR IF THIS I GOINGO LAY ONE  PAC TO G THRGH SILLN PARK. -- SYLN PK. THE HER SIDE,ORTH,EFT SIDE,PPEARS TO BE EASEMENT AND SHOULDE THERE. I'M NO SE WHI SID WE' PUT THE SIDEWA ONIRST BT SEEMS LIKE THE POOL SIDE. OSE AREOM CONCERNS HAVE OUIN THE FUTURE TO CONTINUE TO GET RID OF THESE SIDEWALK GAPS. I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO DO THAT. IN ALL OTHER CASES, I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS NOTION THAT WE KIND OF DECOUPLE THE STREET FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD AT LEAST USING THIS METHOD FOR NOW UNTIL IT'S WARRANTED THAT IT CONNECT. AND I'M NOT SURE EVELL BE. BUT I'LL LEAVE THAT FOR FUTURE BODIES TO DECIDE. THANKS FOR BRINGING THIS FOR FORWARD.
03:03:41.678: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS?
03:03:43.179: >> I WOULD PREFER TO VOTE ON THIS AMENDMENT SEPARATELY, NOT CONSIDER IT AS A FRIENDLY AMENDMENT. I'M COMPLETELY COMFORTABLE WITH THE RESOLUTION WITH THE PROJECT AS IT'S PRESENTED BUT I AM CONCERNED ABOUT NOT CREATING NETWORK CONNECTIVITY. I AM VERY SYMPATHETIC TO THE CONCERNS THAT THE NEIGHBORHOOD IS RAISING. I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT I WOULD FEEL DIFFERENTLY IF I WERE LIVING ON ELY ROAD. AS FOLKS HAVE NOTED FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD, THERE IS AN EXISTING CUT-THROUGH TRAFFIC ISSUE THAT I THINK IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY ADDRESS AS A COMMUNIT TO RECOGNIZE THAT IT'S THERE. AND THAT NEEDS TO BE RESOLVED REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THERE'S A CONNECTION OR NOT. I'D LIKE TO NOTE THAT I THINK ON PAGE 4 OF THE NOT YET ADOPTED TRANSPORTATION PLAN THERE IS A CALL FOR LOCAL STREET TRAFFIC CALMING. ONE OF THE NEXT ACTION STEPS IS PILOTING A NEIGHBORHOOD-BASE ADD PLOACH TO TRAFFIC CALMING. ONE OF THE CHALLENGES OF OUR PROGRAM IS THAT IT EXISTS RIGHT NOW IS IT LOOKS AT SMALL SEGMENTS AND DOESN'T TAKE A MORE NETWORK I WOULD BE FULLY SUPPORTIVE OF PRIORITIZING THIS AREA. I THINK WE CAN ANTICIPATE ADDITIONAL PROBLEMS. BUT FOLKS HAVE A LOVE-HATE RELATIONSHIP WITH ROADS AND CONNECTIONS AND CARS. I THINK THE NEIGHBORHOOD COULD ADMIT THAT THEY WOULD HAVE CHALLENGES IF THEIR CONNECT DWROIFT YOST [INDISCERNIBLE] WAS CUT OFF. IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE THAT EXISTING CONNECTION THAT WOULD SOLVE THE CUT-THROUGH PROBLEMS THHEY HAVEIGHT NOW BUT THAT WOULD CREATE CHALLENGES FOR THEM IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD. IT WILL CREATE CHALLENGES FOR THESE NEW RESIDENTS THAT ARE GOING TO LIVE THERE AS WELL. WE NEED TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM. THE PROBLEM OF PEOPLE SPEEDING THROUGH NEIGHBORHOODS. FACT THAT ALL OF US OR MANY OF US WHO HAVE CARS ARE GUILTY OF DOING THAT. WE NEED TO CREATE A DIFFERENT RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR CARS IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS. THAT'S -- WE HAVE THE TOOLS TO DO THAT. WE SHOULD PRIORITIZE IT IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD. I THINK WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT THE EQUITY OF WHO GETS CONNECTIVITY AND WHO DOESN'T.
03:06:12.695: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND?
03:06:19.669: >> Cou
03:06:23.439: >> Councilman Grand:  THANK YOU. AS I'VE SEEN THIS COMPROMISE, I THANK COUNCILMEMBER RADINA AND FOR STAFF FOR COMING UP WITH THINK DOES COME TO A MORE OF A KEY MICED SOLUTION. -- COMPROMISED SOLUTION. I'M GENERALLY NOT COMFORTABLE WITH GATES BETWEEN NEIGHBORHOODS THAT DOESN'T FEEL GOOD. I THINK -- I KNOW IT'S NOT BEST PRACTICE. BUT AT THE SAME TIME I'M ALSO NOT COMFORTABLE WITH STREETS THAT DON'T HAVE SIDEWALKS ON THEM THAT CONNECT TO A NEIGHBORHOOD AMENITY. SO FOR ME, THAT'S THAT BALANCE RIGHT NOW. I DO THINK THIS IS A NEIGHBORHOOD THAT BASED ON THE FEBACK I'VE HEARD H VERY MUCH EMBRACED THE HEALTHY STREETS PROGRAM, REALLY DID FEEL THAT THAT WAS A HELPFUL INITIATIVE AND REALLY WANTS TO GO BACK TO THAT TO HELP WITH THEIR CUT-THROUGH PROBLEM I THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE A NEIGHBORHOOD THAT'S GOING TO BE INCREDIBLY OPEN TO TRAFFIC CALMING INITIATIVES. I'M HOPING -- THIS ISN'T THE LAST OF IT. THI WE INTEND -- PART OF THE WAY THIS WAS WRITTEN SO THAT STAFF COULD MAKE THE DETERMINATION TO OPEN THE GATE ONCE IMPROVEMENTS WERE IN PLACE SO THAT WE CAN WORK WITH STAFF TO TRY TO EXPEDITE AND PRIORITIZE IN A WAY -- AGAIN, IT HAS TO BE ABOVE BOARD AND EQUITABLE AND DONE WELL. BUT THIS IS A NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE YOU HAVE LOTS OF KIDS WALKING TO SCHOOL. WE'RE LOOKING TO ADD KIDS. ONE OF THE BEN JUST TO SPEAK BRIEFLY, BUT IT IS A NICE DEVELOPMENT. IT IS A 100% ACCESSIBLE DEVELOPMENT. SO ACCESS -- WHEN I READ IN THE REPORT THAT THERE COULD BE AN ISSUE WITH BUSES KNOWING THAT IT WAS 100% ACCESSIBLE DEVELOPMENT, THAT RAISED A REAL ALARM FOR ME. SO, THAT IN AND OF ITSELF IF WE CAN'T GET -- I DON'T BELIEVE THIS IS GOING TO BE AN ISSUE NOW WITH SOME QUESTIONS ANSWERED. BUT IF WE CAN'T GET KIDS WITHDIL THAT WOULD BE A REASON TO OPEN THE GATE. RIGHT? AND THAT WOULD TRIGGER THAT. AT LEAST THAT'S MY EXPECTATION. IN COMING AT THIS. I REALLY DO HOPE THAT WE CAN MAKE THIS CONNECTED. THERE'S A REAL NEIGHBORHOOD ASSET IN THIS POOL THAT HAS HAD THEIR FINANCIAL STRUGGLES. I THINK THIS DEVELOPMENT IS GOING TO HELP BOLSTER THAT AMENITY BECAUSE THERE WILL BE THAT MANY MORE KIDS AND FAMILIES THAT CAN COME AND WALK AND BIKE. WE JUST WT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S SAFE TO DO SO WHEN THEY DO. SO I DON'T LOOK AT THIS AS PERMANENT. I LOOK AT IT AS A WAY TO KIND OF PUSH AND GET TO SAFETY.
03:09:27.423: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER?
03:09:29.859: >> Councilman Ramlawi:  I'M NOT SURE IF I GOT THIS THE FIRST TIME OR. NO I APOLOGIZE. WHEN IT COMES TO THE COST AND THE OWNERSHIP AND MAINTENANCE OF THIS GATE, WHAT ASE IF THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT?
03:09:46.008: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. LENART?
03:09:49.145: >> I DON'T HAVE DETAILS ON THAT. BUT GIVEN ITS LOCATION IT WOULD BE IN THE PUBLIC RIGHT OF WAY. I THINK ULTIMATELY IT WOULD BE INSTALLED AS PART OF THE DEVELOPMENT BUT ULTIMATELY WE WOULD BE ACCEPTING THE MAINTENANCE OF THAT. I THINK THE GATES ARE RELATIVELY SIMPLE. I DON'T HAVE THE DETAILS. IT HASN'T BEEN RAISED AS A CONCERN OF SIGNIFICANT MAINTENANCE COSTS.
03:10:15.138: >> THE COST TO INSTALL IS BORN BY WHO?
03:10:20.209: >> AS PART OF THIS PLAN THAT ROAD CONNECTION IS GOING TO BE MODIFIED -- INSTALLED BY THE PETITIONER, SUBJECT TO THE CITY'S SPECIFICATIONS AS PART OF THIS REVIEW, WE WOULD BE ADDING TO THOSE PLANS, THE INSTALLATION OF THAT GATE.
03:10:35.725: >> Councilman Ramlawi: THANK YOU.
03:10:37.326: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RADINA?
03:10:40.296: >> THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY BE BRIEF BECAUSE COUNCILMEMBER GRAND ALREADY SUMMED UP A LOT OF WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY. TO ANSWER SOME OF THE QUESTIONS ASKED ABOUT THE INTENTION OF WHETHER OR NOT THIS WOULD BE PERMANENT OR NOT, THE LANGUAGE ALLOWING FOR A METHOD FOR THE GATE TO BE UNLOCKED AND RE-OPENED WASN'T INTENTIONAL TO ESSENTIALLY ALLOW US TIME TO DEAL WITH SOME OF THOSE EXISTING PEDESTRIAN SAFETY ISSUES THAT ALREADY EXIST IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD BEFORE WE ADD ADDITIONAL PEDESTRIAN AND CYCLEFFIC IN ADD TO ADDITIONAL VEHICLE TRAFF. SOHE INTENON IS VERY MUCH TO ESSENTIALLY PROVIDE US WITH SOME TIME TO DEAL WITH SOME OF THE EXISTING PEDESTRIAN SAFETY ISSUES BEFORE ADDING ADDITIONAL USERS TO THOSE CONCERNS. THANK YOU AGAIN. I APPRECIATE EVERYONE.
03:11:35.885: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
03:11:38.187: >> THANK YOU. I HAVE A QUESTION FOR STAFF. AT LEAST ONE OF THE RESENTS MENTIONED TO US THAT IN A PREVIOUS NEGOTIATIONROUND WT WAS GOING  GO HERE THERE WAS SOME AGREEMENT ABOUT IT NOT CONNECTING. AND I'M JUST CURIOUS HOW CITY POLICIES HAVE CHANGED WHERE THAT WAS AN AGREEABLE ARRANGEMENT HOWEVER MANY YEARS AGO AND NOW IT'S NOT.
03:12:07.016: >> AS REFERENCED SEVERAL TIMES, A PREVIOUS SITE PLAN FOR THE SITE WAS APPROVED BY CITY COUNCIL. CONNECTI WITH A G WAS A LIMITED. SINC THAT TIME, THIS PLAN HAS GONE THROUGH ONE OTHER RECENT ITERATION BEFORE THIS ONE. AS FAR AS WHAT CHANGED, I CAN ONLY SPEAK FOR THE REVIEWERS THAT HAVE BEEN REVIEWING THESE PROJECTS. A VARIETY OF OUR MASTER PLAN DOCUMENTS EMPHASIZE NEIGHBORHOOD CONNECTIVITY. AS I INDICATED, STAFF BELIEVES THAT OF FULL CONNECTION H MESSE GOAT. IT PROVIDES THE MOST ACCESSIBILITAND CONNECTIVITY OF THIS PROPOSED NEIGHBORHOOD WITH THE EXIST NEIGHBORHOOD. IT PROVIDES CHOICES ON BOTH NEIGHBORHOODS AND THIS NEW DEVELOPMENT. SO, BASED ON THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS, THAT'S WHERE BOTH THE STAFF PLANNING, TRANSPORTATION, AND OTHER REVIEWERS' RECOMMENDATION TO CONFIGURE WITH THE CONNECTION ORIGINATED FROM. I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE PREVIOUS I DON'T HISTORY AS TOT -- IF THW ALREADY INCLUDED AT THE OUTSET OR IF THAT EVOLVED THROUGH DISCUSSION AS WELL. I DON'T KNOW OF THE TIMING ON THAT.
03:13:36.973: >> THIS IS A VERY INTERESTING CONVERSATION COMING OFF OF THE LAST NUMBER OF MONTHS WHERE WE REALLY HAVE TALKED ABOUT THE VALUE OF DISCOURAGING ROAD TRAFFIC ON STREETS WHERE PEOPLE WANT TO USE THEM AS PEDESTRIANS OR CYCLISTS. SO I GUESS I'M CURIOUS.ART FROME ANY SITE-SPECIFIC IDEAS ABOUT LOCATIONS WHERE WE MIGHT LEGITIMATELY WANT TO DISCOURAGE TRAFFIC? I'M THINKING ABOUT CONVERSATION THAT I'VE HAD WITH STAFF ABOUT HOW SIDEWALKS ARE PRIORITIZED. WILL WE RECOGNIZE THERE ARE SOME AREAS OF THE CITY WHERE IT IS LEGITIMATELY MORE IMPORTANT FOR SIDEWALKS TO EXIST AND THOSE RISE TO THE TOP IN TERMS OF GAPS WE WANT TO FILL. I'M CURIOUS. APART FROM THEOLIC AROUND CONNECTIVITY, ARE THERE ANY POLICIES IN PLACE AUND LOCATIONS, LE A COMMUNITY POOL OR AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WHERE THAT TO BE AT THE END OF AEAD ENJUST BECAUSEE KNOW HOW MANY YOUNG PEOPLE AND CHILDREN
03:14:49.378: >> I NOT AWARE OF ANY. THAT WOU PROBABLY B A QUESTI WELL PED TO THE CITY ENGINEER AWELL WHO I RESPONBLE FOR ULTIMATELOME CAPITAL PROJECTS.ONS A I WOULD SAY GENERALLY WE ASPIRE TO DESIG OUR NETWORK SE, RIOD. GOING  BE A CONVERSATIONS OBVIOUY THAT HAS COMUT OF THE DISCUSSNOAR OF E PROPOSEDRANSPORTATION MASTER PLAN. IT IS HOW DO WE MAKE THE DECISIONS BOTH ON THOSE LOCAL STREETS AND HOW DO WE MAKE THE CAPITAL DECISION DES S TO MEET SAFETY GOALS? I'M NOT AWARE OFNYTHING SPECIFIC THAT SAYS, YOU KNOW, WE WANT ALL POOLS ON DEAD ENDS. WE WANT A SAFE NETWORK. AND WE WANT THOSE SITES ULTIMATELY TO BE PROBABLY AS ACCESSIBLE AS THEY CAN BE FOR THEIR SUCCESS.
03:15:54.777: >> IS THERE A HISTORY OR DO YOU KNOW IS A HISTORY OF STREETS IN THIS AREA PARTICIPATING IN OUR RESIDENT-DRIVEN TRAFFIC CALMING PROGRAM?
03:16:04.019: >> I DON'T KNOW THAT. THAT WOULD BE ALSO A QUESTIONR Y ENGINEER.
03:16:11.494: >> OK.
03:16:12.194: >> I'M SURE WE COULD FIND OUT THAT ANSWER AND PROVIDE AN UPDATE TO COUNCIL.
03:16:18.601: >> I APPRECIATE THAT. WERE THE POLICY AROUND CONNECTIVITY -- IT'S INTERESTING TO ME THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A GATE HERE I KNOW THAT THERE'S A DEVELOPMENT IN WARD 4 WHERE THERE HAS BEEN A NEGOTIATION AROUND A GATE, A SAFETY GATE, TO SPECIFICALLY PREVENT CUT-THROUGH , I'M -- I AMHAT ALARMED IF OUR POLICY AROUND CONNECTIVITY DOESN'T HAVE SORT OF QUALIFIERS AROUND SITUATIONS WHERE LEGITIMATELY YOU DON'T WANT CUT-THROUGH TRAFFIC. WELL, THANK YOU FOR ANSWERING MY QUESTIONS.
03:17:00.242: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER SONG?
03:17:04.914: >> COUNCILMEMBER SONG: I TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT THE CUT-THROUGH THIS AFTERNOON AND WAS INVITED BY THE FORMER DIRECTOR OF THEDISCERNI ON ELY ROAD. I'M FAMILIAR WITH THE ROAD BECAUSE MY SON'S PRESCHOOL TEACHER LIVED ALONG HERE, TOO. IT'S A VERY SMALL, NARROW AREA. FOREST BROOK IS REALLY POPULAR. COMPARISONS TO WARD 2, WE HAVE A POOL HERE, ORCHARD HILLS, WHERE THERE IS A LOT OF KIDS THROUGHOUT THE SUMMER GOING BACK AND FORTH, RIDING THEIR BIKES AND WALKING. I UNDERSTAND -- I'M REALLY STRUCK BY ONE PUBLIC COMMENT SAYING THAT THIS COULD BE A MOLR DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS IN ANN ARBOR WHERE WE HAVE TO CONSIDER, YOU KNOW, OUR CHILDREN'S SAFETY ISSUES AS WELL AS THE NEEDS FOR INCOMING RESIDENTS AND TRYING TO PLAN AHEAD FOR THAT. I WISH SCHOOLS COULD SOMEHOW CHIME IN. MAYBE THEY ALREADY HAVE WITH STAFF,YS COU COUNCILWOMAN GRAND POINTED OUT THIS WOULD BE AN ATTRACTIVE DEVELOPMENT FOR KIDS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS GIVEN THAT IT'S FULLY ACCESSIBLE IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO HAVE THIS H THAT INFORMATION, TOO. I JUST WANT TO THANK THE NEIGHBORS FOR SENDING IN THEIR COMMENTS AND ALSO TO JULIE AND TRAVIS FOR WORKING SO HARD IN TRYING TO FIND A COMPROMISE.
03:18:48.651: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER AYER?
03:18:58.327: >> YES. SO AGAIN, ECHOING LINH, THANK YOU TO TRAVIS AND JULIE -- I'M SORRY, COUNCILMEMBER ARE A DINA AN COUNCILMEMBER GRAND FOR COMING UP WITH THIS SOLUTION. THERE IS A NEIGHBORHOOD THAT I VISIT FAIRLY REGULARLY. AND I'M ALWAYS STRUCK BY THE LACK OF SIDEWALKS THROUGHOUT THE NEIGHBORHOOD BUT ESPECIALLY ON THE  T TT ARE COMMONLY TRAVERSED. I THINK THIS IS A GOOD TEMPORARY SOLUTION. I DO WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT. I AM SUPPORTING IT BECAUSE IT IS TEMPORARY. I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE THAT GOAL EVENTUALLY OF FULLY CONNECTING IT AS THAT IS THE BEST PRACTICE. WE CAN'T BE A NEIGHBORHOOD OF DISCONNECTED LITTLE POCKETS OF DEVELOPMENTS THAT'S NOT A CITY. SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS ENT. I F FWAO THE WORK THAT WILL B B IN THE FUTURE TO IMPROVE SAFETY TO CALM TRAFFIC AND TO FILL THOSE SIDEWALK GAPS THAT ARE NEEDED IN THE AREA. THANK YOU.
03:20:08.630: >> Mayor Taylor:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE AMENDMENT BASICALLY FOR THE REASONS ARTICULATED BY COUNCILMEMBER AYER. THE LACK OF APPROPRIATE AND SUFFICIENT PEDESTRIAN INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE AREA IS SOMETHING WE NEED TO ADDRESS OVER TIME AND HOPEFULLY NOT TOO AT THAT POINT I THINK IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TOEVISIT THE CONNECTION. UNTIL THAT TIME, HOWEVER, THE ABSENCE OF SIDEWALKS IN PARTICULAR IS SOMETHING WHICH CARRIES THE DAY FOR ME. FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, ON THE AMENDMENT STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER. [ROLL CALL]
03:21:25.873: >> Clerk Beaudry:  MOTION CARRIES.
03:21:27.843: >> Mayor Taylor:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? MAIN MOTION AMENDED.COUNCILMEMB?
03:21:37.486: >> Councilman Ramlawi: THANK YOU. I JUST WANTED TO THANKVERYONE INVOLVED WITH THIS PIECE OF PROPERTY OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. I KNOW LAST YEAR IT WAS A MUCH DENSER PROJECT AS BEFORE. TO PUT IN SOMETHING THAT'S AGAIN MUCH DENSER THAT WOULD HAVE EXASPERATED THE CURRENT CONCERNS THAT RESIDENTS BROUGHT UP THIS TIME AROUND. BUT THIS TIME AROUND IT'S A BY RIGHT DEVELOPMENT. IT WILL OBVIOUSLY FILL OF T MISSIONE H NEED IN OUR COMMUNITY. UNFORTUNATELY IT'S NOT AS CHEAP AS IT NEEDS TO BE BUT COSTS OF BUILDING IS NOT CHEAP. THAT'S JUST A MATTER OF FACT. SO, THE FOREST BROOK NEIGHBORHOOD IS OBVIOUSLY A STRONG, TIGHTLY KNIT COMMUNITY. IT'S RATHER IMPRESSIVE THE OUTPOURING AMOUNT OF COMMUNICATION THAT WE'VE RECEIVED FROM THEM AND THE WORK THAT THEY'VE DONE WITH T ELECTED LEADERSHIP SO EVERYTHING HAS BEEN DONE TO THE POINT WHERE I FEEL COMFORTABLE SUPPORTING THIS RESOLUTION WITH THE AMENDMENT THAT WAS JUST PASSED. SO THANK YOU TO ALL WHO HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS PROCESS.
03:23:01.770: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
03:23:04.740: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANKS MR. MAYOR. IT SHOULDN'T TAKE US TOO LONG TO GET THESE SIDEWALK GAPS COMPLETE. WHEN LOOK AT THEELLITEIMAGE OF E NEIGHBORHOOD AND NOW I'M LOOKING THEATELLITE THE'S NOT THAT MUCH MISSING. I'M HOPEFUL THAT WILL MOVE FORWARD SWIFTLY. SOME OF YOU MAY RECALL LAST TIME IT WAS LARGER. THEY HAD ASKED FOR MODIFICATIONS TO ADD BASICALLY ANOTHER FLOOR OR SO, 60 MORE UNITS -- 40 MORE UNITS AFTERRED FORRABLE HOUSING. I SUPPORTED THAT EFFORT BECAUSE WE HAD THIS 120 BY RIGHTS IN BEFORE US. BASICALLY WHAT THEY WERE ASKING FOR LAST TIME WAS 40 ADDITIONAL GENUINE AFFORDABLE UNIICH IS EXAHAT W WENT T VOTERS FOR TO ASK FOR MONEY TO . TH WAS A SITUATION WHEREHE DEVELOPERS WERE GOING TO GIVE IT TO US IF ONLY WE WOULD SAY YES. WE DIDN'T SAY YES I THINK THAT WENT DOWN 7-4. AND THAT WAS A DISAPPOINTMENT FOR ME. IT WAS EASY FOR ME TO SUPPORT IT WITH THOSE 40 UNITS OF MUCH NEED ADDED FORRABLE HOUSING ATTACHED TO IT -- AFFORDABLE HOUSING ATTACHED TO IT. I WON'T DISPARAGE THE FORMER COUNCIL MAKEUP BUT IT BUMMED ME OUT AT THE TIME. IT WAS CLEAR THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE BACK AS A BY RIGHT WITHOUT THAT ADDED PUBLIC BENEFIT SO I'M DISAPPOINTED BY THAT I'M GOG SUPPORT BAUSE IT IS RIGHT. ESPECIALLY WITH THE MODIFICATIONS TO THE CONNECTIVITY HERE. I JUST WANTED TO PUBLICLY EXPRESS MY DISAPPOINTMENT THAT IT DIDN'T PASS LAST TIME WITH THE ADDITIONAL PUBLIC BENEFIT AND SET OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING GOALS BACK A LITTLE. IF I COULD ASK THE PETITIONERS TO GO AWAY AND COME BACK WITH THE ORIGINAL PLAN, I WOULD. BUT I'M SURE THEY'RE HAPPY TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS AND GET SOMETHING TRE.I WILL CERTAINLY S AND THE AIR THAT THEY BREATHE AND THE BUFFER FM THIGHWAY, I DON'T SEE A CHOICE BUT TO SAY YES TO THIS. LET'S SAY YES AND GET ON WITH IT. NEIGHBOR 60 YEARS THESE WILL BE AFFORDABLE. THANKS.
03:25:07.796: >> Mayor Taylor:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? OPPOSED? APPROVED. MY APOLOGIES. DC -- DC -- I'M GETTING LOST IN MY AGENDA. SORRY. C1, ORDINANCE. [READING] DISCUSSION OF C1? ALL IN FAVOR?
03:26:07.723: >> AYE.
03:26:08.357: >> OPPOSED? [NO AUDIBLE RESPONSE] APPROVED.
03:26:12.527: >> Mayor Taylor:  C2. READING] MOVED. SECONDED. DISCUSSION PLEASE OF C2. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
03:26:27.209: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANKS. I WANTED TO SHARE WITH THE BODY THAT CAN'TRT THIS. THIS CAME UP BRIEFLY AT OUR CAUCUS DISCUSSION LAST NIGHT THAT WE ARE WELL ON OUR WAY TO DOUBLING THE CITY'S WATER RATES WITHIN A COUPLE OF YEARS. EVERY 6% TO 7% INCREASE, NINE OF THOS AND WE'VE DOUED THE RATES. THIS IS LIKE THE FOURTH ONE I THINK OR FIFTH ONE THAT I'LL GET TOAY N I UNRSTAND THERE'S A DEMAND FOR WATER REVENUE THAT WE ED STABILITYN OURATER RENUE. Q&THATHIS ISRIVEN SEWHATTHE BY A SLIN THEEMAND FM COMMCIAL USE WHICH, OF COURSE BUSINESSESHAT ARE NO LONRND BECAUSOF N IN-RVICE GETWERE THAT OUR UGE IS DOWN. WH'S DISAPPOINTI IS WE EVER COME BACK AND REA INTO E CKET OF E RESIDENTS T MAKE SISS BECAU OF THIOMMEIA 'S ABLE TIM ASKONE TO PAY MORE. I'M JUST GOING TO VOLT MY CONSCIOUS AND SAY NO. AS MUCH AS I APPRECIATE THE NEEDS THAT A WATER SYSTEM HAS, I WOULD LIKE TO SEE US BE IN A POSITION WHERE WE WEREN'T SO SUSCEPTIBLE TO THIS KIND OF VOLATILITY. I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE PATH FORWARD IS FOR THAT. I CAN'T SAY YES TO THIS. IT'S WHOLLY INAPPROPRIATE. I GOT A REALLY NICE AND SOMEWHAT TRAGIC E-MAIL FROM A CONSTITUENT WHO BASICALLY SUGGESTED I JUST THATLL THEY CANAN DO IS SHRUG AND SAY HOW AM I GOING TO PAY FOR THIS? ON MY FIXED INCOME, MY HUSBAND IS LAID OFF. THERE'S PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY THAT ARE ON THE EDGE. IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE $20 MORE A QUARTER OR WHATEVER WOULD PUSH THEM OVER BUT WHEN YOU HAVE A FIXED INCOME, YOU'RE ASKING YOURSELF WHAT DO I GIVE UP TO PAY FOR THIS? I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER FOR THAT WOMAN. I'M SORRY I DON'T OTHER THAN TO SUGGEST THAT WE DO HAVE PROGRAMS IN PLACE THAT HELP PEOPLE SO OFF.R WATER DOESN'T GET SHUT THAT'S WHERE SOMEFHEHELE. I'M GOING TO BEOTING NO TO THIS. IT'S SORT OF A MORAL OPPOSITION TO DO THIS TO PEOPLE.
03:28:51.486: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER DISCH.
03:28:55.524: >> I, TOO, AM REALLY SYMPATHETIC WITH THE PEOPLE WHO ARE HAVING A STRUGGLE TO PAY THEIR UTILITY BILLS. WE DEFINITELY NEED TO BE ACTIVELY CONNECTING FOAM BARRIER BUSTERS. I THINK THAT WE'RE IN A SITUATION WHERE THERE IS AN OCCASIONAL -- LI PROXIMATE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM HERE THAT DOES HAVE TO DO WITH DECLINE IN COMMERCIAL USE AND REVENUE INTO OUR WATER SYSTEM. BUT THERE'S ALSO A STRUCTURAL CAUSE. AND THAT IS THAT WE HAVE 500 MILES OF PIPE THAT IN THE PAST WE HAVE NOT KEPT UP WITH WHAT WE NEED TO KEEP UP WITH. WE NEED A REPLACEMENT RATE OF 1% OF THAT PIPE A YEAR. FOR MANY YEARS WE HALF A PERCENT OF REPLACEMENT PER YEAR. NOW WE'RE PLAYING CATCH-UP. AS WE LEARNED, I BELIEVE, FROM SOME OF THE ANSWERS TO AGENDA QUESTIONS IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 WE REPLACED .81 MILES OF PIPE, AGAIN, UNDER THE 1% OF WHAT WE NEED TO BE DOING. IN FISCAL YEAR 19, 1.97 IN FISCAL YEAR 22.3. SO, WE ARE PLAYING CATCH-UP TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET REPLACING OUR INFRASTRUCTURE BEFORE IT REACHES THE END OF ITS LIFETIME WHICH IT IS APPRO APPROACHING. WE CAN'T IGNORE THESE STRUCTURAL ISSUES. IF WE IGNORE OUR INFRASTRUCTURE, WE WILL NOT HAVE A CITY. I DON'T THINK THAT WE CAN RESPONSIBLY NOT VOTE FOR THIN CREASE PARTICULARLY BECAUSE IT WAS DECIDED TO DEFER THE INCREASE FOR THEUM I THINK WE DON'T HAVE A CHOICE HERE BUT TO DO THAT. AND THEN WE DO NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT RESIDENTS GET CONNECTED TO BARRIER BUSTERS. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FUNDING IS HEALTHY SO THAT WE AREN'T HAVING A SITUATION WHERE PEOPLE ARE CHOOSING BETWEEN MEDICATION THAT THEY NEED AND WATER. May Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
03:31:23.938: >> Councilman Ramlawi: THANK YOU. I'LL USE BOTH OF MY TIMES. CUT ME OFF AT THREE AND I'LL SPEAK FOR ANOTHER THREE. THIS IS ONLY THE FIRST READING. BUT I WILL STATE SOME CONCERNS THAT I HAVE. I WON'T BE SUPPORTING THIS EVEN AT FIRST READING. WE ARE UNDER A CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT RIGHT NOW. WE HAVEN'T HAD A CLOSED SESSION WITH NEW COUNCIL YET TO DISCUSS THE DETAILS AND THE UPDATES ON THAT CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT. THAT IS A HUGE ISSUE THAT'S HANGING OVER US AND ONE THAT WILL AFFECT MY SUPPORT FOR FURTHER INCREASES UNTIL THERE IS BETTER CLARIFICATION ON THAT LAWSUIT. SECONDLY, THIS IS A TWO-STAGE INCREASE, ALMOST 14% INCREASE IN SIX MONTHS FOR FOLKS BECAUSE OF THE DELAY TT PREVIOUS COUNCIL PASSED ON RATE INCREASES IN JULY OF THIS YEAR. SO, IF THIS WAS -- WE'RE IN A PANDEMIC ECONOMY. I'M NOT CONVINCED THAT WE'RE AT THAT POINT WHERE THE FUND IS REALLY UP AGAINST THE WALL AND THAT THE REVENUES NEED TO BE -- THE PERCENTAGES NEED TO BE RAISED ACROSS THE BOARD IN WHAT I BELIEVE IS AN UNFAIR RATE STRUCTURE, A RATE STRUCTURE THAT IS FLAWED, A RATE STRUCTURE THAT HAS INDUCED THE DEFICITS REPORTED IN THE FUNDS. THE FOURTH TIER DID NOT PRODUCE THE REVENUE THAT STAFF AND OTHERS THOUGHT IT WOULD WHICH RESULTED IN A $1.4 MILLION SHORTFALL, WHICH I BELIEVE ISTRY HEAD. SECONDLY OR PROBABLY FOURTH BY NOW IS THE USE OF THE WATER FUND TO PAY FOR ONGOING LITIGATION WITH GELMAN. WE HAVE BEEN OVER $500,000 USED FROM THE WATER FUND TO PAY FOR LITIGATION THAT I FEEL PROBABLY COULD BE SHARED BY SOME OTHER FUNDS. SO WE'RE PUTTING OFF INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENT AT TIMES TO A LAWSUIT. SO, I HAVE ISSUES WITH THAT. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT OUR NEED TO KEEP UP WITH OUR INFRASTRUCTURE REPLACEMENTS, FACT IS WE'RE NOT KEEPING UP. WE'RE NOT. EVEN THE LAST TWO TO THREE YEARS PRIOR TO THIS REQUEST WE'RE NOT KEEPING UP. AND THE DELAYS AND INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS THAT WERE PUSHED OFF FOR A YEAR WERE THE PANDEMIC. AND ALSO DUE TO THE LO LOSS $1.4 MILLION, BECAUSE OF PROJECTIONS THAT WERE OFF.
03:34:35.530: >> [INAUDIBLE]
03:34:35.930: >> Councilman Ramlawi:  I'LL COME BACK.
03:34:37.932: >> Mayor Taylor:  THANK YOU. FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN MOTION? [NO AUDIBLE RESPONSE] COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
03:34:47.442: >> Councilman Ramlawi: THANK YOU. I'M NOT SURE WHERE I WAS. BUT AGAIN, BARRIER BUSTERS SHOULD BE A LAST RESORT. IT SHOULD BE WHERE SOMEBODY WHO IS IN TRANSITION WHO LOST THEIR JOB HAD A MEDICAL EMERGENCY, DID SOMETHING. BARRIER BUSTERS IS NOT THERE TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR BILLS MONTH IN AND MONTH OUT. THAT TO ME IS NOT A SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEMS THAT PEOPLE ARE FACING TODAY. THAT IS A BAND-AID. THAT IS NOT WHERE PEOPLE NEED TO GO FOR SYSTEMATIC RELIEF. SO, I APOLOGIZE. I KNOW WE HAVE ANOTHER TIME TO SPEAK ABOUT THIS. YOU'LL HEAR THESE COMMENTS AGAIN AND PERHAPS SOME MORE.
03:35:36.858: >> Mayor Taylor:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? I'M GOING TO VOTE IN FAVOR OF THE ORDINANCE TODAY AT FIRST READING AND AGAIN AT SECOND READING. I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE A DUTY TO MAINTAIN OUR WATER INFRASTRUCTURE. I THINK WE ALL HAVE A DUTY TO RESIDENTS WHO HAVE YET TO COME TO ANN ARBOR TO LEAVE THEM A MUNICIPAL WATER SYSTEM THAT IS SAFE AND EFFICIENT AND DELIVERS WATER TO THEM EFFECTIVELY AT AS LOW COST AS POSSIBLE. I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING WE ARE REBUILDING -- WE ARE REPLACING MILES OF PIPE WHICH IS NECESSARY. WE ARE BUILDING FUNDS IN ORDER TO REPLACE AND MODERNIZE A WATER TREATMENT PLANT THAT WILL SERVE ANN ARBOR FOR MANY, MANY DEC DECADES. THAT WATER TREATMENT PLANT MODIFICATION IS GOING TO COST EIGHT FIGURES. IT'S GOING TO MEET CTAM CONTAMINANTS -- ADDRESS CONTAMINANTS THAT WE KNOW ABOUT AND PROBABLY WILL NEED TO BE SUFFICIENTLY FLEXIBLE TO MEET CONTAMINANTS WE HAVE NOT YET IDENTIFIED FOR WHICH REGULATIONS DO NOT YET EXIST. AND WE NEED TO PAY FOR THAT BY RAISING RATES. IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT TO FAIL TO DO THAT I THINK -- IT DOESN'T DO RIGHT BY THE PEOPLE WHO COME R US. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO THAT. FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER. [ROLL CALL VOTE] MOTION CARRIES.
03:38:18.685: >> Mayor Taylor:  DO WE HAVE D2 AND D3? ARE THOSE PROPERLY O TENDA ON T?
03:38:30.331: >> Clerk Beaudry:  THE RESOLUTIONS ARE STILL ON THE AGENDA. IT'S JUST THE PUBLIC HEARING CANCELED.
03:38:36.070: >> Mayor Taylor:  THANK YOU. D2. [READING] MOVED --

03:39:51.279: >> Councilmember Hayner:  AS I SAID AT THE SRT OF THE MEETING, THE PRESUMPTION IS THIS WILL BE VOTED DOWN. I HOPE THAT THAT'S SO. AND THAT THESE SEGMENTS MOVE FORWARD WITH BEING FILLED BASED ON THE SIDEWALK MILLAGE. IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN, SOME PARTS OF THIS ALREADY HAVE OR ARE UNDERWAY IN THE PLANNING STAGE BECAUSE OF OTHER PROJECTS IN THE AREA. I WOULD ASK EVERYONE SAY NO TO THIS. THANK YOU.
03:40:23.077: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
03:40:25.713: >> Councilman Ramlawi: THANK YOU, MAYOR. APPRECIATE STAFF'S WORK IN RESPONDING TO QUESTIONS THAT WE HAD REGDING THESE ASSESSMENTS IN THE NEWLY PASSED MILLAGE TO ADDRESS THESE SIDEWALK GAPS. AGAIN, THANKS TO THE VOTERS OF ANN ARBOR WHO SUPPORTED THAT MILLAGE. THE FIRST COUPLE OF YEARS OF COUNCIL FOR MYSELF WAS FILLED WITH LONG MEETINGS THAT REQ REQUIRED, YOU KNOW, THOUGHTFUL, LONG DISCUSSIONS ABOUT HOW WE FUND THESE SIDEWALK GAPS IN ORDER ADDRESS OUR COMPLETE STREETS POLICY AND GET CONNECTIVITY THROUGHOUT OUR COMMUNITY. AND HOW WE DO IT IN AN EQUITABLE AND FAIRWAY WHERE WE HAVE THE COST OF THE GREATER GOOD BEING BORN BY FOLKS WHO HAVE THE UNFORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCES OF BEING IN A PLACE WHERE IMPROVEMENTS WERE BEING MADE THAT TRIGGERED FILLING IN SIDEWALK GAPS. FOLKS THAT DIDN'T REQUEST THESE SIDEWALKS, AND IN MANY CASES WERE HIT WITH HUGE ASSESSMENTS. IN ONE CASE IN THE FIFTH WARD EARLIER THIS YEAR, ONE PROPERTY OWNER WAS GOING TO BE ASSESSED OVER $50,000. SO IT IS AWESOME HERE TONIGHT. WE CAN VOTE SOMETHING DOWN IN A POSITIVE WAY AND BRING RELIEF TO MANY RESIDENTS IN A VERY MUCH MORE EQUITABLEAY. THANKS FOR EVERYBODY WHOAD A HAND IN MAKING THIS HAPPEN.
03:42:10.951: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS?
03:42:15.890: >> I'D LIKE TO REITERATE. THANKS TO THE VOTERS OF ANN ARBOR AND THE PREVIOUS COUNCIL FOR GETTING THIS ON THE BALLOT. THIS IS A HUGE STEP FORWARD. IT'S GREAT TO SEE THAT THOSE TENSIONT WE HAD AROUND WHO SHOULD PAY FOR THE SIDEWALK WILL NOT INHIBIT OUR SIDEWALK NETWORK MOVING FORWARD. THIS IS GREAT.
03:42:50.691: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD?
03:42:55.730: >> Councilman Griswold: YES. I WANT TO THANK AND RECOGNIZE COUNCILMEMBER B BANISTER FOR HER HARD WORK IN GETTING THIS ON THE BALLOT. IT'S A MAJOR STE. IT WILL IMPROVE PEDESTRIAN SAFETY. I WOULD JUST LIKE TO REQUEST THAT MOVING FORWARD THAT WE MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT WHICH SIDEWALK GAPS WILL BE FILLED CONSISTENT WITH THE METHODOLOGY OF VISION ZERO. THANK YOU.
03:43:26.560: >> Mayor Taylor:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? ALL OPPOSED? IT IS NOT APPROVED.
03:43:42.443: >> ARE WE DOING A ROLL CALL WITH THAT?
03:43:44.612: >> THAT WAS JUMBLED.
03:43:46.247: >> DO WE HAVE TO? IS IT REQUIRED?
03:43:51.685: >> Mayor Taylor:  ROLL CALL HAS BEEN REQUESTED. I THINK IT'S POLICY WHEN A ROLL CALL IS REQUESTED WE HAVE A ROLL CALL. SO ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER. [ROLL CALL VOTE] MOTION FAILS.
03:44:36.729: >> Mayor Taylor:  D3. [READING RESOLUTION] MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER ARE A DINA, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER SONG. DISCUSSION, PLEASE. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
03:44:53.781: >> Councilman Ramlawi:  JUST LIKE THE PRIOR RESOLUTION VOTED DOWN, THIS WAS POSTPONED BY PRIOR COUNCIL UNTIL THAT VOTE COULD BE TAKEN IN NOVEMBER WITH THE ASSESSMENTS. THANKFULLY, AGAIN, IT WILL BE DONE BY THE GREATER GOOD FOR THE GREA GOOD. WE'V A LOT OF QUESTIONS FROM CONSTITUENTS ASKING WHICH OTHER SIDEWALKS PERHAPS COULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR FUNDING WITH THIS NEW MILLAGE. AND STAFF WAS GRACIOUS ENOUGH TO OFFER US A TIDBIT OF WHAT IS ON THE HORIZON IN ADDITION TO THESE TWO. I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S OUT OF ORDER FOR ME TO DESCRIBE THESE TWO TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC OR NOT BUT CUT ME OFF AT ANY TIME. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ADDITIONAL SIDEWALKS TO BE FILLED FOR 2021 ON BOARDWALK, ON JACKSON AVENUE, MANCHESTER DRIVE, STIMSON, YOST, ELY. SO AGAIN, JUST THE GREAT EFFECT OF WORKING TOGETHER HAS BROUGHT POSITIVE POLICY CHANGE. AGAIN, BY VOTING NO HERE WE AR DOING GOOD.
03:46:15.329: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD?
03:46:17.298: >> Councilman Griswold:  I JUST WANT TO APOLOGIZE FOR THE DELAYED COMMUNICATION TO SOME OF OUR CONSTITUENTS. THIS IS REALLY SORT OF AN UNUSUAL PROCESS. SO WE WERE FOCUSING ON DOING WHAT WAS BEST FOR THE PROPERTY OWNERS. DIFFERENT THAN THEAL PROCESS. AGAIN, I APOLOGIZE.
03:46:45.426: >> Mayor Taylor:  FURTHER DISCUSSIONS? ALL IN FAVOR? ALL OPPOSED? DOES NOT PASS. DC1. [READING RESOLUTION] MOVED. SECONDED. DISCUSSION, PLEASE OF DC1. ALL IN FAVOR? ALL OPPOSED? APPROVED. DC2. [READING RESOLUTION] MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER DISCH. DISCUSSION, PLEASE, OF DC2. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
03:48:26.994: >> Councilmember Hayner: JUST BRIEFLY. IT WAS SPELLED OUT PRETTY WELL BY FOLKS ON OUR ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION THAT IT'S IMPORTANT WE PASS THIS. AND ALSO SOME RESIDENT EXPERTS SAID IT'S IMPORTANT WE PASS THIS. MR. HANCOCK HAS BEEN WORKING ON THIS FOR QUITE A WHILE. I THINK WE ALL COULD RECOGNIZE IN CLOSED READINGHAT IT MIGHT NOT BE EVERYTHING WE NEED ITO BE BUT CERTAIN DEADLINES NEED TO BE MET. SO I URGE THE PASSAGE OF THIS. I ALSO URGE EVERYBODY IF THEY HAVEN'T ALREADY TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION'S COMMENTS AND STATEMENT ON THIS AND THAT WE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE BRING THIS BACK FOR THE IMPROVEMENTS WE THINK ARE GOING TO BE NECESSARY. I ALSO WANT TO THANK MR. HANCOCK FOR HANGING IN THERE, PUTTING THIS TOGETHER, WORKING SO HARD AND REALLY ADVOCATING STRONGLY HAT ON FOR THE TYPES OF CHANGES AT WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO MAKE A RESILIENT AND SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY MOVING FORWARD. I THINK THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT WE'LL SEE IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS -- I THINK WE ALREADY HAVE SEEN IT -- INCREASED STORMS, INCREASED FLOOD WATER AND STORM WATER SITUATIONS. IT'S GOING TO BE A REAL CHALLENGE FOR THE CITY MOVING FORWARD. THIS CERTAINLY HELPS MOVE US IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. IT'S MUCH [INDISCERNIBLE] I URGE US TO COME TOGETHER AND MAKE NECESSARY CHANGES TO THIS QUICKLY MOVING FORWARD. I KNOW -- I WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED THAT STORM WATER WASN'T MORE PROMINENT IN OUR PLAN BUT IT DOES EXIST. DR. STOLTSES ASSURED ME THAT THE RESILIENCE PORTION OF THIS IS CRITICAL TO OUR CITY. THANKS, MR. HANCOCK, AND EVERYBODY FOR WORKING TO PUT THIS TOGETHER. LET'S GET THIS PASSED AND TAKE THE NEXT STEPS AFTER THAT. THANK YOU.
03:50:13.867: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER DISCH?
03:50:16.904: >> IN ADDITION TO THE EXCELNT INTS COUMB HR JUST MADE, I THINK IT'S ALSO WORTH NOTING THAT SHOULD WE PASS THIS FLOOD OVERLEIGH-LEIGH DISTRICT, WE WILL MOVE OURSELVES FROM CLASS 6 TO CLASS 5 WHICH IN A WEIRD WAY IS A MOVE FOR THE BETTER. THAT MAKES US STRONGER. AND IT QUALIFIES US -- WE ARE CURRENTLY QUALIFIED FOR A 20% DISCOUNT ON FLOOD INSURANCE AND WE WILL BE QUALIFIED FOR A 25% DI ON FLO INSURANCE SHOULD WE PASS THIS OVERLAY DISTRICT AND GET THE POINTS ON A SCORING SYSTEM USED TO SCORE SUCH THINGS. SO, IT'S REALLY AN AMAZING PIECE OF WORK THAT MR. HANCOCK HAS DONE. IT IS BOTH SMART POLICY IN THE FACE OF CLIMATE CHANGE AS COCIL MEMBER HAYNER SAID. IT'S SMART POLICY IN THE CASE O.
03:51:23.871: >> Mayoraylor: COUNCIEMBER RAMLAWI?
03:51:26.373: >> Cncilman Ramlawi: THAN YOU. I DO APPRECIATELL THE WOR AT'S GONE IO THIS IN T COMMUNIT OUTREACH TH HAS GONE ON EVEN DING COVID. STAFF HAS GONE BAC OUT AGAINO SOLICIT AS MH INPUT AS IT ULD UNDER THE CONDITIS. I DO HAVE A QUESTNOR SCHAR CTION AND BETTE UERSTANDING BECAUSE THIS IS CPLDOCUMENT HER. MY ISSUE IS -- AND IT HAST REALLYLL BEEN THOUGHT OUT YET AND THIS WILL BE BACK SOON FOR A SECOND VOTE. BUT WONDERING WHETHER THESE ISSUES I HAVE WOULD TRIGGER THINGS TO GO BACK TO A FIRST READING. AND THAT IS WITH THE SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENTS, THE DEFINITION OF SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENTS AND HOW THAT IS CALCULATED, THE AMOUNTS OF MONEY THAT ONE PUTS INTO MAINTAINING IMPROVING THEIR HOME IN SOME CASES MAY BE EXTREMELY PUNITIVE BASED ON THE TAXABLE VALUE OF THE PROPERTY. IF WE COULD PERHAPS GET EDUCATED ON WHAT THOSE MECHANISMS ARE BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME RESIDENTS WHO HAVE, IN THE 5TH WARD, WHERE MUCH OF THE DWELLINGS AFFECTED BY THIS ORDINANCE RESIDE -- IT BECOMES A COST ISSUE OF AFFORDABILITY AND LIVABILITY AND WHETHER THEY CAN AFFORD TO MAINTAIN AND IMPROVE THEIR HOMES AND UNFORTUNATELY BE PENALIZED IN SOME CA CASES WITH THIS NEW ORDINANCE.
03:53:20.954: >> Mayor Taylor:  FURTHER DISCUSSION?
03:53:24.925: >> Councilman Ramlawi:  I WAS ACTUALLY HOPING TO GET STAFF TO GIVE ME AN ANSWER ON SOME OF THIS.
03:53:30.797: >> Mayor Taylor:  I'M SORRY. MR. LENART?
03:53:34.901: >> SURE. AND VILE JERRY HANCOCK JUMP IN MOMENTARILY. THIS WAS A QUESTION THAT WE DID RECEIVE A LOT OF INQUIRIES AB ABOUT. AND FROM THE COUNCIL'S BENEFIT, TO BE VERY CLEAR, WE WERE VERY CAREFUL NOT TO CREATE A NEW DEFINITION OF SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. THERE ARE ALREADY A LOT OF EXISTING REQUIREMENTS ABOUT THAT SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT HAS AN IMPACT ON WITHIN OUR EXISTING BUILDING CODES. SO WE WERE VERY CAREFUL TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN WE'RE DEFINING THAT, WE ARE POINTING TO THOSE EXISTING DEFINITION. HOWEVER, THAT SAID, THOSE CODES ACTUALLY DON'T DEFINE A PERIOD OF DURATION AT TIMES. SO THEY COULD, IN FACT, BE MEASURED AS INDEFINITE. THAT IS, OVER THE LIFE OF A BUILDING YOU COULD MEET THOSE THRESHOLDS. WE THOUGHT IT WAS MORE APPROPRIATE TO ACTUALLY PUT SOME TIME SPAN ON THAT. AND THAT'S WHY WE ARE PROPOSING THE 10-YEAR SPAN WHICH IS SLIGHTLY MORE BENEFICIAL TO PROPERTY OWNERS THAN THE BUILDING CODE ITSELF. JERRY?
03:54:51.044: >> NO, TH THAT'S CORRECT. THE DEFINITION OF SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT IS FOUND IN THE BUILDING C. N IN THE BUILDING CODES SINCE THE 80'S WHEN THE CITY JOINED THE NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM. WE'RE NOT CHANGING ANYTHING ABOUT THAT EXCEPT FOR WHAT MR. LENART TALKED ABOUT IN INTRODUCING THIS 10-YEAR TIMEFRAME. WITH THE BUILDING CODE NOT DEFINING A TIMEFRAME IT'S LEFT UP TO INTERPRETATION. AND THE CURRENT INTERPRETATION IS THE LIFE OF STRUCTURE. WE'RE ACTUALLY BEING MORE LENIENT, IF YOU WANT, WITH THE PROPOSAL. ONE COULD INTERPRET THE BUILDING CODE DIFFERENTLY ALSO THAT IT'S PERMIT BY PERMIT. BUT THAT'S THE PROBLEM THAT IT'S NOT DEFINED. SO FEMA ACTUALLY ENCOURAGES COMMUNITIES TO DEFINE IT. THEY GIVE POINTS WITHIN THE COMMUNITY RATING SYSTEM, THE 10-YEAR TIMEFRAME THAT WE CHOSE TO PROPOSE GETS US THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF POINTS IN THAT PARTICULAR AREA.
03:55:55.509: >> Councilman Ramlawi: WOULD A SEVEN HIGH YEAR TIME PERIOD GET YOU THE SAME AMOUNT OF POINTS OR IS IT THE 10-YEAR TIMEFRAME?
03:56:04.818: >> IT'S 109-YEAR. -- 10-YEAR. POINT SYSTEM, YOU GET NO POINTS IN THIS PARTICULAR CATEGORY UNLESS YOU HAVE A FIVE-YEAR TIMEFRAME AND THAT GETS YOU 50% OF THE POINTS. AND YOU GET 50% OF THE POINTS ALL THE WAY UP TO 10 BUT IT'S 10 OR MORE YOU GET FULL CREDIT.
03:56:25.305: >> Councilman Ramlawi:  DOES IT JEOPARDIZE WHERE OURALIFICATO REDUCE THIS TO FIVE YEARS?
03:56:33.446: >> NO. IT'S JUST LESS POINTS THAT WE GET.
03:56:37.984: >> Councilman Ramlawi:  AND BY CHANGING JUST THAT PART OF THIS WHAT WOULD OUR TOTAL POINT BE? WOULD IT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR TOTAL SCORE?
03:56:48.662: >> I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT BECAUSE THIS ORDINANCE HASN'T BEEN APPROVED. I HAVEN'T GONE THROUGH AND SCORED EVERY ITEM WITH THE CRS REPRESENTATIVE. I KNOW WT POINTS ARE POSSIBLE. I DON'T QUITE KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT.
03:57:09.249: >> Councilman Ramlawi:  I WOULD LIKE TO GET THE ANSWER TO THAT IF I COULD. I KNOW SIMPLE HOME REPAIRS ON THE OLD WEST SIDE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS THAT THE HISTORIC COMMISSION PLACES ON HOMEOWNERS, IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE TO DO ANY TYPE REEF MODELING OR MAINTENANCE TO HOMES. I THINK GOING BACK 10 YEARS IS GOING  BE -- CREATE SOME HARDSHIP FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE.
03:57:36.576: >> A REALLY IMPORTANT JUSTIFICATION. IN THE BUILDING CODE, THE CONCEPT OF SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT DOESN'T APPLY TO HISTORIC STRUCTURES. SO THE CATEGORY THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, THEY NEVER GET THE STAPLE IMPROVEMENT CALCULATION -- SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT CALCULATION DONE FOR THEM. YOU CAN CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN THE HISTORIC STRUCNDER KICK IN THE FLOOD REQUIREMENTS. THAT'S IN THE BUIING CODE. WE'RE NOT PROPOSING TO CHANGE THAT.
03:58:06.940: >> Councilman Ramlawi:  WHAT ABOUT DWELLINGS IN HISTORIC DISTRICTS NOT NECESSARILY DESIGNATED HISTORIC? THEY RESIDE BETWEEN WHERE I AM NOW AND RADINA, NOT HISTORIC HOMES BUT RESIDING IN THE HISTORIC DISTRICT, ARE THOSE TRIGGERED?
03:58:25.759: >> BRET, I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THAT TYPE OF A BUILDING.
03:58:30.297: >> WE WOULDOOK -- THE HISTORIC DISTRICT IS HOW WE DESIGNATE PROPERTIES NOOR DESIGNATION. IF THEY ARE DESIGNATING HISTORIC STRUCTURES, THEY ARE GOING TO BENEFIT FROM THAT SECTION THAT ALWS FLEXIBILITY IN MAINTENANCE WITHOUT COMPLIANCE. THE SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT OBVIOUSLY IS INTENDED TOIT IS INTENDED ULTIMATELY TO HAVE AN IMPACT ONSE PROPERTIES, THAT IS TO ENSURE THAT OR TI THA WE ARE NOT INVESTING HIGH AMOUNTS OF RESOURCES INTO PROPERTIES AT RISK. SO, THAT'S THE PHILOSOPHY OF TRYING TO, IN FACT, PUNT A BARRIER IN SOME LIMITATIONS SO THAT OVER TIME WE CAN MINIMIZE THOSE RISKS TO THOSE STRUCTURES THAT ARE IMPACTED.
03:59:29.089: >> THANKS FOR BEING HERE TO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS.
03:59:32.425: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER AYER?
03:59:39.165: >> I'M ALL SET. THANK YOU.
03:59:40.333: >> Mayor Taylor:  ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION? ON FIRST READING ALL IN FAVOR? ALL OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. DO WE HAVE COMMUNICATIONS TODAY FROM OUR CITY ATTORNEY?
03:59:59.219: >> NO, MAYOR.
04:00:00.120: >> Mayor Taylor:  WE HAVE BEFORE US THE CLERK'S REPORT OF COMMUNICATIONS, PETITIONS, AND REFERRALS MOTION TO AMOVE. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER DISCH, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER AYER. DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? OPPOSED? CLERK'S REPORT IS APPROVED. WE NOW COME TO PUBLIC COMMENT GENERAL TIME. PUBLIC COMMENT GENERAL TIME IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO SPEAK TO COUNCIL AND THE COMMUNITY ABOUT MATTERS OF MUNICIPAL INTEREST. TO SPEAK, ONE NEED NOT HAVE SIGNED NEWSPAPER ADVANCE. SPEAKERS WILL NEED TO DIAL 87 7-5247. YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES IN WH SPEAK. PLEASE PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE TIME. OUR CLERK WILL NOTIFY YOU WHEN 30 SECONDS ARE REMAINING AND WHEN YOUR TIME UP IS. WHEN YOUR TIME UP IS, CONCLUDE YOUR REMARKS AND CEDE THE FLOOR. IS THERE ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT?
04:01:34.112: >> Clerk Beaudry:  PHONE COMMEN ENDING 205, DO YOU HAVE A
04:01:43.223: >> HEY, THIS IS JOE SPALDING FROM OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA. I JUST WANTED TO ECHO TRISH DUCKWORTH AND SAY THAT JEFF HAYNER SHOULD RESIGN. OBVIOUSLY I HAVE THE STUFF THAT I DO FOR FUN AND ALSO MY CAREER IF IT COMES DOWN TO ANOTHER ELECTION, THAT'S GOING TO BINTE. BUT I REALLY -- THIS IS KIND OF BEYOND ANYTHING I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT WOULD BE HAPPENING WITH THIS COUNCIL HERE. I MEAN THE WAY THAT FOLKS NEED TO LOOK AT THIS IS IF SOMEBODY MAKES AN ADDITION ON THEIR HOUSE AND THEY DON'T TELL THE CITY ABOUT IT, THEY'RE REALLY STEALING FROM EVERY ONE OF THE CITIZENS ON SOME LEVEL, ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT PROPERTY VALUE THAT ARE GOING UPWARDS OF 2% EVERY MONTH. EVEN WITHOUT THE ASSESSED ADDITION ON THE HOUSE, YOU'RE LOOKING AT HAYNER'S PROPERTY, IT'S GOING UP IN TERMS OF, LIKET SITTING THERE. THERE'S PROP A IN MICHIGAN. ALREADY THE HOMEOWNERS HAVE A LEG UP IN TERMS OF THE AMOUNT OF RESOURCE THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO [INDISCERNIBLE]. I DON'T THINK IT'S ANY SURPRISE TO ANYONE WHO KNOWS ME, ANY TYPE OF ACTIVIST LEVEL. THE REASON I CALL IN TO ANN ARBOR IS B MINUTE PER THE AMOUNT OF SEGREGATION I GET TO FIGHT. I'M HAVING THE BIGGEST IMPACT THERE THAN I WOULD IN THE COUNTRY. THERE'S NO EXCUSE FOR THE TYPE OF RESOURCE HOARDING THAT'S GOING ON THERE AND THAT BEING TIED UP THERE. I KNOW COUNCILMEMBER NELSON, NOT USUALLY TALKING ABOUT YOU, I THINK I SAID SOMETHING POSITIVE LAST TE I CALLED I BECAUSE YOU DID SOMETHING COOL I DON'T REMEMBER WT IT IS. IT REAY ISN'T OK TO BE TALKING ABOUT ANY MEMBER OF THIS COUNCIE FEW OFOU -- AS BRINGINGNY TO THE CITY WHEN THERE ARE] PEOPLE DRING EVERYAY TT E FRONTLINE WORKERS,XPING EMSELVES TO A DEADLY VIRUS FROM THE OTHERIDE. THOSARE THE FOLKS TT I THINK ABOUT EN I THINK ABOUT ECOMIC DIVERSITY I DON THINK AUT LAND OWNER IN ANNRB. I DINITELY ARECIATEHE GOING TO BAT FOR POOR PEOPLE. IT'S SUPER IMPORTANT. BUT I REALLY DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT USING THAT TYPE OF LANGUAGE AS A SHIELD WHEN WE HAVE A HUGE POPULATION THAT'S FACING HOUSELESSNESS, UNEMPLOYMENT, AND VERY UNCERTAIN FUTURE EVEN THOUGH WE'RE LOOKING RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER LIKE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A VACCINE NOR VIRUS.
04:04:36.929: >> Clerk Beaudry:  30 SECONDS.
04:04:39.365: >> I KNOW MR. HAYNER IS NOT GOING TO RESIG NEW THERE WAS A RISK THAT PEOPLE WERE GOING TO DISVER THE UPSTAIRS THERE. HE HAD THE BACKUP PLAN WITH REMOVING THE STAIRS IS MY GUESS. I KNOW FOLKS THAT HAVE TRIED TO GET AWAY WITH THAT STUFF IN THE PAST. I USED TO THROW HIGH STEEL. I USED TO DO CONSTRUCTION. $9 AN HOUR, NON-UNION, AND WE HAD PEOPLE THAT TRIED TO CUT CORNERS LIKE THAT, TOO. THANKS, EVERYONE.
04:05:08.027: >> Mayor Taylor:  THANK YOU.
04:05:14.367: >> Clerk Beaudry:  CALLER WITH PHONE ENDING 891, DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT?
04:05:21.407: >> YES, I HAVE A COMMENT. THIS IS EDWARD. I'D LIKE TO SPEAK TO ONE OF THE SIDEWALK GAPS IN OUR CITY THAT I DON'T THINK WOULD TAKE MUCH MORE THAN A DAY TO REPAIR OR FIX. IT'S IN THE -- ADJACENT TO RY GARDENS, END OF COAL ROAD. THERE IS A FOOTWAY, NOT VERY LONG, THERE'S A GAP. IT LOOKS LOOK A DELIBERATE GAP IN THE FENCE. IT'S TOO NARROW FOR A BICYCLE THOUGH YOU COULD PROBABLY SQUEEZE THROUGH IF YOU'RE REALLY CAREFUL. IT'S TOO NARROW FOR A STROLLER. IT'S TOO NARROW AND BUMPY AND TOO EVERYTHING THAT'S WRONG WITH THAT FOR A WHEELCHAIR OR OTHER SORT OF ACCESSIBLE DEVICE. IT CONNECTS KOHLER WHICH WAS A SHORT ONE-BLOCK STREET TO WOODBURY GARDENS WHICH IS A BUSY AND POPULAR APARTMENT, TOWN HOME COMPLEX. IT'S USED REGULARLY, ALTHOUGH IT PROBABLY WOULD BE USED MORE IF IT ACTUALLY WORKED. I THINK THE FIX FOR IT IS AS SIMPLE AS A LARGE PAIR OF BOLT CUTTERS TO REMOVE A SECTION OF THE FENCE. THE FENCE IS CURRENTLY IN THE WAY OF THE WAY PEOPLE WANT TO WALK I CAN'T IMAGINE ANYONE DESIGNING THAT PATH TODAY IT MIGHT HAVE MADE SENSE WHEN THE DEVELOPMENT WAS NEW, BUT THE DEVELOPMENT IS NO LONGER NEW. THE FENCE IS PROBABLY ILLEGAL BECAUSE THE CITY HAS A STRICT FENCE CODE. THERE'S PROBABLY SOMETHING WRONG WITH IT BY THE STRICT FENCE CODE. I'D LIKE TO SEE IT TAKEN CARE OF. AGAIN, I LIVE IN THE 4TH WARD AND WALK DOWN THAT PATH. I'M DONE.
04:07:15.121: >> Mayor Taylor:  THANK YOU.
04:07:21.661: >> Clerk Beaudry:  THERE ARE NO MORE CALLERS ON THE LINE.
04:07:31.404: >> Mayor Taylor:  SEE NOTHING ONE FURTHER, PUBLIC COMMENT IS CLOSED. DO WE HAVE A CLOSED SESSION TODAY?
04:07:36.509: >> THE LIGHTS JUST WENT OUT HERE BY THE WAY. I KNOW YOU'RE ON THE OTHER SIDE. IT'S YOUR TURN. WEAR YOUR MASK. COUNCILMEMBER YNEREQUESTED A CLOSED SESSION TONIGHT. THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN MOOTED AT THIS POINT, BUT WE CAN GO INTO CLOSED SESSION IF YOU WANT ON THE GELLMAN MATTER. WE WERE PLANNING TO SET A SPECIAL SESSION PROBABLY NEXT WEEK ON SUBSTANTIVE DETAILS ON THAT. I'M HAPPY TO GO IN. YOU NEED EIGHT VOTES TO GO IN YOU WANT. OTHER PEOPLE HAVE SUGGESTED THEY WOULD LIKE ANOTHER TIME. SO IT'S THE PLEASURE OF THE CIL.
04:08:19.585: >> Mayor Taylor:  I'M GOING TO INFER THAT THERE'S NO CLOSED SESSION. IS THAT CORRECT? IS THAT RIGHT?
04:08:26.292: >> Clerk Beaudry:  MAYOR?
04:08:27.326: >> Mayor Taylor:  I SKIPPED COMMUNICATIONS. THANK YOU. NO CLOSED SESSION. IS THAT RIGHT? ALL AROUND? THANK YOU.
04:08:37.136: >> IT IS?
04:08:39.605: >> WHAT'S THE PRESUMPTION THERE?
04:08:41.741: >> Mayor Taylor:  THE PRESUMPTION IS THAT I WAS -- IF SOMEONE WISHES TO MOVE INTO CLOSED SESSION, THE ISSUE THAT WAS SUBJECT TO CLOSED SESSION, MR. [INDISCERNIBLE] AND I INFERRED WAS MOOTED. IF THAT'S NOT YOUR VIEW, THAT'S OK. YOU'RE COMMUNICATE THAT TO ME NOW.
04:09:06.732: >> I HAD ASKED FOR A CLOSED SESSION TO DISCUSS [INDISCERNIBLE] BEFORE THE CITY AND MATTER OF GELLMAN [INDISCERNIBLE] AND OUR INTERVENING STATUS. IF WE CAN ASK FOR A VOTE IF SEVEN OTHER PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO THEN THAT'S THE WILL OF THE BODY. BUT I WOULD PREFER A CLOSED SESSION.
04:09:25.184: >> Mayor Taylor:  FAIR ENOUGH. IF I MAY IN CASE FOLKS AT HOME ARE INTERESTED IN PUBLIC -- PARDON, COUNCIL COMMUNICATIONS, LET'S PRETEND I DIDN'T ASK MR. [INDISCERNIBLE] ABOUT THE CLOSED SESSION. WE'LL ROLL BACK TO COMMUNICATIONS FROM COUNCIL SINCE I OMITTED THAT. WE'LL ECONOMIC WITH THIS ISSUE OF A CLOSED SESSION AGAIN. WE HAVE COMMUNICATIONS FROM COUNCIL.
04:09:49.875: >> Councilman Ramlawi: THANK YOU. FIRST I'D LIKE TO SAY THANKS TO COUNCILMEMBER DISCH FOR OFFERING AN APOLOGY TO CLARIFICATIONS FOR THE COMMENTS MADE AT PLANNING COMMISSION LAST TUESDAY. I THINK THAT WAS REALLY LARGE FOR YOU TO DO THAT IN A PUBLIC MEETING HERE TONIGHT. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE STRIVE FOR TRANSPARENCY AND INCLUSION. ON PARTICIPATION. SO GRATEFUL FOR THAT CLARIFICATION HERE TONIGHT. I'M ALSO GRATEFUL FOR THE FACT THAT COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS AND COUNCILMEMBER DISCH WITHDREW DC3 FROM TONIGHT'S AGENDA. THAT CAUSED A LOT OF STRESS AND ALARM NOR IN THIS COMMUNITY AND I THINK ULTIMATELY FOR THE TWO CO-SPONSORS AS WELL BECAUSE OF THE BLOWBACK AND FEEDBACK THAT THEY RECEIVED. I DO WANT TO TALK ABOUT PUBLIC ENT. TOMORROW WILL BE MY FIRST TIME ATTENDING THE ADMIN COMMITTEE MEETING. I UNDERSTAND THAT RULES HAS BEEN COLLAPSED END OF THAT. I'M DISAPPOINTED BY THE ATTEMPTS OF SOME TO CALL IN AND REALLY ATTACK AND ASSASSINATE THE CHARACTERS OF ELECTED OFFICIALS. WE HEARD THAT BY TWO PEOPLE WHO CA IN O PERSON WHO EVEN IN THIS TIME ZONE. THAT WHY I WISH W COULD GO -- ONE OF THE REASONS WE COULD GO BACK TO IN-PERSON MEETINGS. I'D LOVE TO SEE MR. SPALDING FLY IN OR BIKE IN OR WHATEVER HE DOES AND COME TO OUR MEETINGS IN PERSON THE WAY YOU HAD TO BEFORE ZOOM MEETINGS ALLOWED PEOPLE TO CALL IN FROM ALL SORTS OF PLACES AND REALLY JUST WASTE OUR TIME AND HAVE SOME SORT OFGENDA THAT'S BNG PUT FORTH. THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH GOVERNING. IT'S REALLY DISAPPOINTING. I WON'T GO INTO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT I COULD BRING UP BY THE TRANSGRESSIONS OF OTHER COUNCIL MEMBERS THAT HAVE NEVER BEEN TALKED ABOUT OUT OF RESPECT. BUT APPARENTLY THAT'S NOT UNIVERSAL. I ALSO HAVE QUESTIONS ON WHEN CONSTITUTU AF COUNITY CALL IN WHETHER THEY NEED TO STICK TO THE TOPICHEY SIGNED UP FOR AS THE CASE TONIGHT WHERE WE HAD SOMEONE CALL IN, SAID THEY WERE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE MICHIGAN THEATER GAMING RESOLUTION BUT THEN WENT ON TO ATTACK AN ELECTED OFF OFFICIAL. WHERE -- IS THERE A CALL TO ORDER? IS THERE ANY MUTING THE MIC? HOW DOES SOMEONE SIGN UP FOR METHINY HAVE TO SIGN UP FOING ON ATENDIA, AND THEN SWITCH TO SOMETNG COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT AND JUST ATTACKING AND EMBARRASSING ELECTED OFFICIALS? I DON'T THINK THAT'S HELPFUL. I REALLY DON'T. THE SOONER WE CAN GET RID OF THAT KIND OF STUFF, THE BETTER WE ALL WILL BE.
04:13:26.959: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
04:13:29.728: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I HAVE TO AGREE WITH WHAT COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI JUST SAID. IT'S AN UNUSUAL SITUATION THATRH EATED HERE. YOU HAVE TO SIGN UP AT THE START AND SAY WHAT Y'RE GOING T TALK ABOUT. PRESUMABLY YOU STICK TO THAT. OBVIOUSLY PEOPLE DON'T. THAT'S JUST THE WAY FREE SPEECH GOES. BUT WHAT WE HAVE HERE AT THE END IS A SITUATION WHERE ANYBODY IS WELCOME TO CALL IN AND BERATE AND REPEAT LIES AND DO WHATEVER ODDBALL THINGS THESE FOLKS HAVE DONE WHERE IN THEIR WILDEST DREAMS THEY WOULDN'T HAVE THE NERVE TO COME DOWN HERE AND STAND IN FRONT OF US AND SAY THESE THINGS. I'M GOING TO ASK THE ADMIN TEE LOOK A WHAT ARE RULES FOR ESPECIALLY THE SECOND COCIL COMMENTARY PERIOD WHICH TYPICALLY HAS BEEN YOU GOT TO GET YOUR BUTT DOWN TO THE CITY HALL. WE'VE SEEN IT WHERE ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE HAVE REACTED. WE'VE SEEN MR. [INDISCERNIBLE] COME DOWN TO SPEAK ON BIKING ISSUES, SHOWED UP AT THE LAST SECOND BECAUSE -- WE SEE IT ALL THE TIME WHERE PEOPLE DO THAT. THAT'S GREAT. IT'S GREAT THAT THAT WAS AVAILABLE TO THEM. IT'S GREAT THAT IT'S AVAILABLE TO RESIDENTS ON THE PHONE. BUT I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF T SATIONS FROM CALIFORNIA. IT'S JUSTIDICULOUS. THE SUGGESTION THAT HE MADE WAS RIDICULOUS. YEAH, I'M TAKING MY STAIRWAY IN AND OUT OF MY UNFINISHED UPSTAIRS EVERY NIGHT. GIVE ME A BREAK, MAN. JUST BECAUSE YOU SAW SOME LOSER DIRTING THE RULES IN CALIFORNIA 20 YEARS AGO. IT'S A DISGUST COMPARISON. I COMPLETELY REJECT ANY NOTION THAT I'M DODGING TAXES FROM THE CITY. IF THE CITY -- THE CITY INSPECTORSE BN I HOUSE. EY KNOWHAHASNG NOTE REAL STORY . DODGING TAXES.RY IS'M NOT MY HOUSE ISN'T COMPLETE. A SIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS IN POVERTY HALTED MY PROJECT. IT IS NOTHING MORE THAN THAT. AND IT WAS HALTED 10 YEARS AGO BEFORE I WAS ON COUNCIL. SO YOU KNOW, SUCK ON THAT, MR. [INDISCERNIB]. I'M TIRED OF IT. I'M TIRED OFT. I'M TIRED OF THE ACCUSATIONS FROM POLITICAL PEOPLE COMING IN HERE. IT'S NOT HPING IT'S N MOVIN OUR COMMUNITY FORWARD. IT'S TOOUCH. IS I WANT AIN T TAKE A LOOK ARWE GOING TOONTINUE TO LET PEOPLE FM OUT OF STATE CALL IN AND BERATE COUNCIL MEMRS? IS THAT REALL USEL TO OUR PROGRESS A A CMUNITY? TA THAT QUESTIONP. IT'S A MUCBETTER QUEION THAN DOE NEED A N LOBIST OR SO OF THE OTH THINGS TALKE ABOUT. I JUST PUT THAT OUT THERE. I URGE ADMIN COMMIEE TO TAKE UPHE RULROUNDUR PUBC COMMENRY. THAN YOU
04:16:38.417: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER AYER?
04:16:41.687: >> THANK YOU. I LOOK FORWARD TO SERVING ON THE RULES AND ADMIN COMMITTEE. I LOOK FORWARD TO OUR FIRST MEETING TOMORROW. I KNOW WE WILL BE HAVING A DISCUSSION ABOUT PUBLIC CORY. I THINK M HOPE IS THAT WE WILL START AT HOME FIRST AND THAT WE WILL TAKE A GOOD STRONG LOOK AT HOW WE AS COUNCIL MEMBERS TALK TO EACH OTHER, TALK ABOUT EACH OTHER PUBLICLY WHEREVER THAT MAY BE AND THINGS I'VE HEARD REPEATEDLY IN MY CAMPAIGN AS I TALKED TO PEO PEOPLE -- AM I FROZEN? OK. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I HEARD REPEATEDLY DURING MY CAMPAIGN WAS THAT PEOPLE WERE REALLY -- IS IT OK NOW?
04:17:57.162: >> Mayor Taylor:  NOT PERHAPS  BETTER? I DID.
04:18:03.469: >> Mayor Taylor:  GIVE IT A TRY.
04:18:09.208: >> GREAT. I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH WAS PICKED UP. I'M SORRY. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SERVING ON THE RULES COMMITTEE. I THINK THAT WE WILL HAVE DISCUSSION ABOUT PUBLIC DISCOURSE. AND MY HOPE IS THAT RATHER THAN GOING AFTER THE PEOPLE WHO CRITICIZE US FIRST THAT WE START AT HOME AND LOOK AT OUR OWN BEHAVIOR AS COUNCIL MEMBERS. I THINK WE HAVE A LOT TO IMPROVE. THE THINGSHAT I ROUTINELY HEARD WHEN I WAS RUNG WAS THE FACT THAT PEOPLE WERE FED UP WITH HOW COUNCIL MEMBERS TREAT EACH OTHER IN COUNCIL MEETINGS AND ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND IN OTHER PLACES PUBLICLY. SO I THINK THAT WE WILL TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. I WOULD POINT OUT, TOO, THAT WE HAD SEVERAL PUBLIC COMMENTERS ATTACK COUNC MEMBERS AND GO OFF TOPIC. THAT CERTAINLY IS SOMETHING THAT WE COULD LOOK AT. BUT I'M MORE CONCERNED FIRST WITH ADDRESSING HOW WE TREAT EACH OTHER HERE AT COUNCIL AND MAKING AN IMPROVEMENT -- [INDISCERNIBLE] THAT WILL GO A LONG WAY TOWARDS SETTING A GOOD MODEL FOR --UDIO DROP]
04:19:45.404: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ARE  RADINA?
04:19:53.178: >> THANKS. I'LL TRY TO BE BRIEF. I JUST WANT TO CAUTION EVERYONE. IRRESPECTOFF OF ANY OF THE COMMENTS MADE BY ANY OF OUR SPEAKERS TONIGHT, I CAUTION EVERYONE FROM BEING WHAT I WOULD VIEW AS TOO REACTIVE AND QUICKLY MOVING TO SHUT DOWN ANY TYPE OF IC TO SPEAK TO U AS LL.E I THINK ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF ZOOM RIGHT NOW IS ALSO THAT WE ARE PROBABLY MORE ACCESSIBLE TO OUR RESIDENTS THAN WE WERE BEFORE. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF FOLKS WHO DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE THE ABILITY TO MAKE IT DOWN TO CITY HALL, WHETHER IT'S A CHILDCARE ISSUE OR A SIMPLE MOBILITY ISSUE. IT'S CHALLENGING FOR SOME FOLKS TO GET TO THE BUILDING AND TO SPEAK TO US IN PERSON. SO I JUST WANT TO CAUTION AGAINST GOING TOO FAR IN THEOPPN CRITICISM AND REMEMBER THAT THERE ARE BENEFITS TO US BEING ACCESSIBLE AS WELL. THANKS.
04:20:52.537: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND?
04:20:56.608: >> I WON'T REPEAT WHAT COUNCILMEMBER AYER SAID BUT KNOW THAT I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT CONVERSATION AS WELL TOMORROW. IN PART I'M MOTIVATED BY SOME THINGS THAT I SAW OUR COLLEAGUES, FRANKLY, CALL ANOTHER THAT I HAD CONCERNS ABOUT THIS WEEK, BOTH OVERE-MAIT ENTIRE COUNCIL AND THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA BUT NOT NEEDED TO REHASH THAT BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO REPEAT WHAT WAS SAID. AND I DO AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE 3RD WARD THAT WE HAD SO MANY TIMES WITH PUBLIC COMMENT GENERAL TIME WHERE WE WERE GOING PASSED [INDISCERNIBLE] AND THERE WERE MAJOR ACCESSIBILITY ISSUES. I LOOK FORWARD TO A TIME WHEN WE'RE ABLE TULLY LEARN FROM THESE EXPERIENCESES BE ABLE TO PVI THE ALITY FOR PUBLIC TO COMMENT BOTH IN PERSON AND OVER THE PHONE OR SOME WAY VIRTUALLY. I THINK THAT WOULD BE IDEAL. AND I HAVE ALREADY MET WITH THE PERSON FACILITATING OUR OFFSITE AND FOR MANY OF THE REASONS EXPRESSED THIS EVENING HAVE EXPRESSED MY INTEREST IN SPENDING A LOT OF TIME FOCUSING ON HOW WE COMMUNICATE WITH ONE ANOTHER AS AIL HOPEFULLY ESTABLISHING SOME NORMS  IT WON'T JUS COME FROM RULES BUT IDEALLY COME FROM OUR COLLECTIVE WORK TOGETHER SO THAT WE CAN TALK ABOUT HOW WE WORK WITH OUR PARTNERS IN OUR WARDS AND ACROSS COUNCIL. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT ON MONDAY. THANKS.
04:22:42.781: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD?
04:22:45.217: >> Councilman Griswold: YES. WE HAVE TO FACE THE FACT THAT CITY COUNCIL HAS A REPUTATION AND IT'S NOT A GOOD REPUTATION. WE HAVE A LEADER. WE HAVE A MAYOR SILENT HAPPENERRIBLE, BAD THINGS AND TERRIBLE BAD THINGS ARE HAPPENING IN THE WORLD RIGHT NOW. OUR SECRETARY OF STATE AND HER FAMILY WERE PUT AT RISK, YET WE ALLOW SIMILAR INFLAMMATORY BEHAVIOR TO HAPPEN AT COUNCIL. ANYONE WHO HAS ANY KNOWLEDGE ABOUT CONSTRUCTION, AND I PUT ON AN ADDITION ON MY HOUSE, UNDERSTANDS THAT YOU ROUGH IN THE ADDITION AND DO NOT BREAK INTO THE LIV OF THE HOUSE INITIALLY BECAUSE IF YOU DO, QUITE SIMPLY, YOU'LL HAVE RODENTS IN YOUR HOUSE. SO YOU WANT TO KEEP IT SEPARATE FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE. NOW, WE WERE SILENT. AND DECADES AGO PEOPLE TALKED ABOUT THE SILENT PEOPLE, WERE THEY AS GUILTY AS OTHERS. AND I AM VERY, VERY TROUBLED THAT WE SAT SILENTLY AND ALLOWED THIS TYPE OF ABUSE TO GO ON. SO YES, WE HAVE PROBLEM WITHWHAE ALSO HAVE A PROBLEM WHEN WE'RE SILENT AND WE SHOULDN'T BE SAYING ANY -- WE SHOULD BE CALLING PEOPLE OUT. I BELIEVE I HAVE A RIGHT TO MAKE THIS STATEMENT BECAUSE I RECEIVED ALMOST A DOZEN DEATH THREATS BACK IN JULY AS A RESULT OF STATEMENTS THAT WERE MADE HERE AT COUNCIL. DEATH THREATS. AND THIS COUNCIL AND THIS MAYOR WERE SILENT ABOUT THAT. NOW,S MEAN IT'S OK? I DON'T KW. T I HE THAT NEXT MONDAY WE CAN HAVE A SERIOUS DISCUSSION BECAUSE IF WE CAN'T POLICE OURSELVES, THEN MAYBE WE NEED A SERGEANT OF ARMS OR SOMEONE SO THAT WHEN FALSE STATEMENTS AND NASTY STATEMENTS ARE MADE, WE'RE CALLED OUT IMMEDIATELY AND WE DON'T MAKE EXCUSES AFTER THE FACT. SO I'M SORRY TO BE BLUNT AND WE HAVE A MAJOR PROBLEM AND IT'S NOT GETTING ANY BETTER. THANK YOU.
04:25:06.725: >> Tay COUNCIR DISCH? THAT TE ISSUE ANY BETTER WHENE WE THROW ACCUSATIONS AT EACH OTHER. WE'RE ALL DOING THIS WORK. IT'S COSTLY IN TERMS OF TIME. IT'S COSTLY IN TERMS OF ENERGY. AND I THINK WE NEED TO BE GENTLER WITH EACH OTHER. YEAH, THERE WAS A LOT -- THERE WAS ONE SURPRISING CALLER WHO REVERSED TOXICITY. E WAS TOXICITY THAT WE HA GTE AUSME T BY A FEW REGULAR CALLERS. AND WE WERE QUIET. WE WERE ALL QUIET IN ALL OF IT BECAUSE IT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO DO. BECAUSE IF WE SHOUT DOWN OR SILENT SOME PEOPLE EVEN WHEN THEY ARE TOXIC, THAT MAKES OTHER PEOPLE AFRAID TO CALL. AND, YES, WE COULD HAVE NORMS AND MAYBE WE CAN REVISIT BUT I REALLY WANT TO UERSC WHA COUNCIL MEMBER RADINA SAID WHICH IS THAT -- YOU KNOW, WE HAD 66.7% TURNOUT IN THIS PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. THAT'S UNHEARD OF. COVID, WHICH IS A MAJOR PAIN IN THE YOU KNOW WHAT, HAS TAUGHT US SOMETHING ABOUT HOW TO MAKE DEMOCRACY MORE ACCESSIBLE. AND I AGREE WITH TRAVIS THAT I THINK WE WANT TO NOT BE RCTIVETE WANT TO LEARN THE LESSONSHAT ARE HERE TO BE LEARNED ABOUT STRUCTURAL CHANGES THAT CREATE GREATER OPENNESS AND PARTICIPATION. THAT'S ALL I WANT TO SAY.
04:27:01.339: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS.
04:27:04.776: >> I'D LIKE TO SWITCH THE TOPIC A LITTLE BIT. I THINK ENOUGH HAS BEEN SAID ON THE PREVIOUS TOPIC. REGARDING DC3, I JUST WANTED TO THANK MEMBERS AND PARTNERS WHO REACHED OUT TO USVER TH WEEKEND AND EXPRESSED THEIR OPINNS AND THEIR DISAGREEMENTS WITH ME AND WITH COUNCILMEMBER DISCH ABOUT THE RESOLUTION THAT CAME FORWARD. OBVIOUSLY OUR INTENT WAS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET TO THE BEST CLEANUP AND THE QUICKEST CLEANUP THAT WE POSSIBLY COULD. WE HAD CONCERNS OVER THE ABILITY TO HAVE A DUAL PATH STRATEGY. WE SIMPLY DIDN'T WANT TO JEOPARDIZE THE PATH OF LITIGATION THAT WE'RE ON.BUT ITA THE MOMENTUM IS BEHIN THE ABILITY TO HAVEHIS DUAL STRATEGY. SO, I SLIGHT SE DISCOMFORT WITH THAT BUT I CAN ACCEPT THAT THAT IS WHERE THE COMMUNITY INTERESTS RIGHT NOW. ATE RECEIVED.HE FEEDBAC IT WASN'T ALWAYS COMFOABLE THIS PAST WEEKEND OUR JOB I NOT NECESSALY T MAKE OSELVES GET BK TO THE PREVIOUS COMME DISCUSSION. WE DON'TLWS LIKEEOPLE'S RIGHT T FRE SECH. WEON'T ALWAYS ARECIATE THE WAY THATHEYELIVERT. BUT ON Y START TRYINTO DRAW LINES IN THE SAND, IT'S PRETTY DANROUS. I KNOW THAT THE TOXIC ENVIRONMENT CAN BE TROUBLING. I CERTAINLY THINK -- I AGREE THAT THE PLACE WE NEED TO START IS AROUND THIS TABLE IN TERMS OF WHAT WE PROJECTO THEOMMUABAT'S . AND THE BETTER EXAMPLE WE CAN SET, WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO LISTEN TO US. I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT.
04:29:11.202: >> Mayor Taylor:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? OR RATHER FURTHER COMMUNICATIONS FROM COUNCIL? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
04:29:20.812: >> Councilman Ramlawi:  I APPRECIATE THE SENTIMENT STARTING AT HOME. THAT'S NOT FIRST TIME IT WAS SUGGESTED. I WILL SAY THAT MANY COU MEMB HERE HAVE TAKEN MONEY FROM FOLKS WHO SUBSCRIBE TO NEGATIVE CAMPAIGNING TO CHARACTER ASSASSINATION. THEY HAVE EMBRACED IT. THEY SAID IT'S EFFE EFFECTIVE, T WORKS, GIVE ME YOUR MONEY. SO, NOT JUST THE WORDS WE CHOOSE HERE BUT MAYBE WE SHOULD START LOOKING AT WHERE WE'RE GETTING OUR MONEY FROM AND WHO IS DONATING MONEY TO OUR C CPA AND MAYBE SENDIE OHATNEY BACK FO SUBSCRIBE IN A TYPE OF AWFUL POLITICS THAT WE ALL SAY WE DON'T LIKE. THAT'S ALL.
04:30:21.873: >> Mayor Taylor:  FURTHER COMMUNICATION FROM COUNCIL? I LOOK FORWARD, TOO, TO THE CONVERSATION AT AIN. I WOULD LIKEO, I THI PILE AE BIT COCILMEMBER RADINA WAS SAYING WITH RESPECT TO WHAT I VIEW AS THE INCREDIBLE IMPROVEMENT WITH RESPECT TO ACCESSIBILITY OF THE PUBLIC TO COMMUNICATE TO COUNCIL MEMBERS TO LISTEN TO COUNCIL MEMBERS THAT WE GET WITH REMOTE ACCESS. THERE IS A LOT OF PRIVILEGE BUNDLED INTO THE ABILITY TO COME DOWN TO CITY COUNCIL KNOW S A PUBC HEARING, GET TO A PUBLIC HEARING, SPEAK AT A PUBLIC HEARING AT CITY HALL, COME TO PUBLIC COMMENT, COME TO PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE BACK END. THE SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE NOW IMPROVES ACCESSIBILITY. WITH RESPECT TO POLICING WHAT PEOPLE IN THE PUBLIC SAY AT PUBLIC COMMENT, I'D BE INTERESTED TO HEAR WHAT OTHERS K ARE THE PROPER LINES THAT S OF THING. IN THE END, I DON'T THINK THAT ANYBODY WANTS GOVERNMENT ARTICULATING WHAT IS TRUE AND WHAT IS NOT TRUE FROM THE FLOOR, CUTTING PEOPLE OFF, AND SPEAKING TO THE PUBLIC AND SO FORTH. I THINK WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO ACCEPT A BROAD RANGE OF PUBLIC COMMUNICATION. AND SOME OF IT W TRUE AND SUORTIVE. SOME OF IT WILL BE FALSE AND SUPPORTIVE. SOME OF IT WILL BE TRUE AND CRITICAL. SOME OF IT WILL BE FALSE AND CRITICAL. THAT'S THE MARKETPLACE OF IDEAS. SOME PEOPLE ARE KIND. SOME PEOPLE ARE UNKIND. OBVIOUSLY EXPRESSIONS OF VIOLENCE IN ALL THEIR FORMS ARE UNACCEPTABLE. THAT'S, I THINK, CLEAR TOYONE. WE AS A BODY I THINK VAN LIGATION TO BE KIND TO EACH OTHER. I THINK IT'S INCUMBENT UPON EACH OF US TO EXHIBIT THAT KINDNESS AND TO EXPRESS IT. AND FRANKLY, I THINK IT'S ALSO INCUMBENT UPON US FORGIVE IT WHEN MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC, YOU KNOW TO A POINT, TO FORGIVE IT WHEN MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC DON'T TREAT US THAT WAY. I THINK THAT THAT  UNWELCOMED. I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE, BY OUR ACTIONS AND OUR EXHORTATION SHOULD STRIVE TO IMPROVE AND CORRECT. I THINK IT'S ALSO PART OF THE JOB. I'D BE INTERESTED TO HEAR WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK ABOUT THAT AS WE CONTINUE ON WITH THE CONVERSATION. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
04:33:48.146: >> Councilmember Hayner: I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT WE LIMIT OR CENSOR IN ANY WTPLE SAY. I'M NOT A PROFESSIONAL CENSOR. I JUST WANT TOOINT OUT THAT UNL VE VERY RECENTLY IN THE HISTORY OF CITY COUNCIL WHEN YOU WALKED UP TO THAT PODIUM, WE USED TO HAVE SIGN-IN SHEETS. THEY'D ASK PEOPLE TO SIGN THEIR NAME, ADDRESS, THAT'S WHO SPOKE. I ASSUME THAT'S HOW THE CLERK GOT A RECORD OF THAT FOR HER RECORD. THAT'S AWESOME. AND IT PUTS A LITTLE BIT OF RESPONSIBILITY ON THE SPEAKER TO BE ACKNOWLEDGED HERE I AM, I'M NOT AN ANONYMOUS PERSON, I'M A RESIDENT OF THIS AREA OR THAT AREA. SO MY SUGGE ISEDELY ON T NN THAT WE DON'T EVEN DOES PEOPLE TO SAY WHERE DO THEY LIVE ANYMORE. SO, IF WE EVEN HAD THE MOST BASIC, YOU KNOW, REQUIREMENTS FOR, HEY, MY NAME'S JEFF HAYNER, STREET ADDRESS, I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT THIS IT WOULD PUT THINGS INTO PERSPECTIVE AT THE VERY LEAST. I ASKED TO BE ON ADMIN. [INDISCERNIBLE] WHICH TOOK AWAY FIVE POSITIONS FOR PEOPLE TOSER. I DON'T H ANY REAL INPUT INTO THIS BECAUSE I DN'T GET THAT APPOINTMENT. SO TALK AMONGST YOURSELVES OR WHATEVER BUT I HOPE YOU OPEN IT UP TO THE REST OF US FOR THIS KIND OF INPUT. I'VE MADE NO SUGGESTIONS OF CENSORSHIP, ONLY THAT THE SUGGESTION IS IT'S CLEAR THAT WHAT USED TO BE SOMEBODY HAD TO AT LEAST LIVE WITHIN A REASONABLE RADIUS OF THE CITY HALL TO COME DOWN HERE AND SAY WHATEVER THEY WANTED TO SAY, WELL, THAT'S OUT OF THE WINDOW WITHOUT ANY CONSIDERATION. AND TO SUGGE THAT SOMEHOW WE ARE MORE OPEN NOW BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE THE BURDEN OF PHYSICAL CONTACT ANYMORE, I FIND TO BE KIND OF A TECHNO DEMOCRATIC SOLUTION BECAUSE THERE IS A GREAT PRIVILEGE IN HAVING ACCESS TO A COMPUTER THAT HAS ZOOM, LOOK UP OUR SCHEDULE ON LINE, CALL IN, AND UNDERSTAND THAT. THERE'S A TECHNICAL BARRIER THAT I THINK HAS ITS OWN PRIVILEGES. IF I DIDN'T HAVE THIS LAPTOP KNOW WHAT I WOULD DO. I I'T I DON'T HAVE A COMPUTER NEW ENOUGH TO INSTALL AND RUN ZOOM AT HOME. SO, THERE'S PRIVILEGE THAT COMES WITH ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS ALSO I GUESS IS WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SAY.
04:36:19.564: >> Mayor Taylor:  AS A POINT OF INFORMATION, I DON'T BELIEVE THAT WE ARE PERMITTED TO OBLIGATE IDENTIFICATION. EITHER OF NAME OR STREETESS.
04:36:30.841: >> Councilmember Hayner: THAT WAS SOMETHING WE HISTORICALLY DID?
04:36:34.078: >> Mayor Taylor:  CORRECT. THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING.
04:36:36.414: >> THAT'S CORRECT.
04:36:41.652: >> Mayor Taylor:  FURTHER COMMUNICATION COUNCIL? WITH RESPECT TO THE CLOSED SESSION,.
04:36:49.060: >> Councilmember Hayner: HAYNER?
04:36:54.498: >> Councilmember Hayner: GRAND HAD HER HAND UP.
04:36:57.134: >> SORRY, CLARIFY FOR INFORMATION THAT WE ALSO HAVE MADE CITY HALLCCESSIBLE TO PEOPLE SO THAT IF THEY D'T HAVE ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY THAT WE DO HAVE A PLACE AT CITY HALL WHERE THEY HAVE ACCESS TO COUNCIL MEETINGS AND A WAY TO COMMUNICATE WITH US.
04:37:14.518: >> Mayor Taylor:  FAIR POINT. THANK YOU. COUNCILMEMBER DISCH, GRAND, THANK YOU.
04:37:21.559: >> Councilmember Hayner: HAYNER?
04:37:23.094: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I ASKED FOR THIS CLOSED SESSION FOR A VARIETY OF PURPOSES NOT LEAST OF WHICH WAS THAT WE DO HAVE A COURT HEANG LOO ON THE HORIZON. I HAD A SERIEF QUESTIONS FOR OUR ATTORNEYS THAT I THOUGHT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL FOR ALL OF US TO HEAR AND PERHAPS RESPOND TO IN A CLOSED SESSION REGARDING THE LITIGATION. IF THE PRESUMPTION HAS BEEN MADE THAT IT WENT OUT THE WINDOW AND SAY [INDISCERNIBLE] OR WHOEVER ISN'T AVAILABLE, I GUESS I COULD JUST SEND THOSE QUESTIONS YOU, MR. POSTEMA. BUT I THINK THEY'RE QUESTIONS THAT -- MY LIST OF QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS UPCOMING HEARING D CERTAINLY BENEFIT FROM HAVING EVEONELSE' INPUT ON IT. THAT'S WHERE I'M AT WITH WHY I ASKED FOR THIS CLOSED SESSION. SO I'LL LEAVE IT TO MY COLLEAGUES TO DECIDE IF THAT'S A WORTHY CASE FOR GOING INTO CLOSED SESSION FOR A FEW MIN MINUTES.
04:38:20.017: >> I'M HAPPY TO DO THAT TONIGHT. WE ARE PLANNING TO HAVE MORE SPECIFICITY, AS I HAD WRITTEN BEFORE TO HAVE A SPECIAL SESSION THAT WE WOULD SPEND SOME MORE TIME ON LITIGATION S FOR THE COURT HRING. SOME OF THE MEMBERS HAVE NOT WANTED TO DO THAT LATE AT NIGHT, AND I UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT IT'S REALLY UP TO THE BODY AND COUNCILMEMBER HAIN DEER HAVE THOSE CONCERNS. WE COULD HAVE A SHORTER CLOSED SESSION OR WE COULD WRAP IT ALL INTO ONE WHICH I THINK COULD COVER EVERYTHING. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT LATER THIS MONTH. I'M TALKING ABOUT LATER THIS WEEK OR NEXT WEEK. IF YOU SEND THOSE ALONG, I THINK WE COULD PROBABLY FRAME IT A LITTLE MORE TO BE PRODUCTIVE FOR YOU AND VAGUE HEARING THAT'S USEFUL TO ALL.
04:39:18.042: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WOULD SEND THEM YOU AND YOU CAN DECIDE TO SHARE WITH THE REST OF THE BODY FOR THEIR INPUT ON THESE SAME TYPE OF QUESTIONS? WHAT WOULD BE THE PRIVILEGE METHOD OF COMMUNICATION? CLEARLY THESE ARE QUESTIONS THAT FALL UNDER PRIVILEGE.
04:39:31.756: >> I CAN SEND THE WHOLE B SOME INSTRUCTIONS TOMORROW THAT CAN HELP FRAME A CLOSED SESSION THAT IS EFFICIENT AND USEFUL Y YOU. I'M HAPPY TO DO IT NOW BUT COULD DO IT AT A TIME THAT'S NOT 11:38 BUT AT A TIME CONVENIENT YOU. I THINK THAT MIGHT BE THE BEST THING. YEAH. I THINK THAT WOULD BE THE BEST BET.
04:40:14.999: >> Mayor Taylor:  ANY OBJECTIONS TO ROLLING WH THAT? SENG NONE, I'M GOING TO MOV ON. MOVED. AOURN? DISCUSSION? OPPOSED?? WE'RE AOURNED. GOOD NIGHT, FKS.
