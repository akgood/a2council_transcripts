01:10:57.455: >> Yeah, I guess I would say this. Thank you, mayor pro tem. As am t o town today, I'm grateful for mayor pro tem Lumm, chairing the meeting, facilitating the meeting. Will say that the work that we do at council is all affected by staff. We set the policy for the city and the staff performst for us utilizing their expertise and their love for community. What we have done in our selection, the council and city administrator is perhaps one of the most important things that we do as Councilmembers, because the chief executive officer of the city does carry such weight and importance to the function and the cmunity as a whole. So I'm glad that we are going to be moving forward and inviting four candidates to come back to us to interview, and I look forward to the conversation which will entail, of course, material staff input, community input and discussion among Councilmembers.
01:12:04.088: >> Thank you very much, Mr. Mayor. And I agree, this is very important decision, and I will just briefly speak to the next steps. I just like to provide some information to the public on the process for the city administrator search. At the end of June, Amy was hired by the city to conduct the search, and during July and early August the position was posted candates applied and this all provided council with a pool of candidates. I'd like to thank am Amy and her team for her excellent work over the last 45 days. Councilmembers, just met in closed session to review the pool. We had a very good discussion. And to identify a list of finalists. And I'd like to also thank myolleags for their thoughtful discussion and due diligence in the process. The finalists have been identified and we will be contacted this evening. As soon as they're all contacted, their names and biographical information will be made public, and that's likely to occur tomorrow. Then on Thursday, August 20, the finalists will each parcipate in three interviews with city council, the city staff and with community members. On that same day, August 20, the community survey will be launched to provide community members the opportunity to provide input. Based on the feedback it's expected the city council will determine next steps on August 24.ext steps coulde negotiating with one finalist, inviting multiple finalists for additional interviews or relaunching the search. So that's a brief summary of the process and next steps. And my thanks to city staff that have helped out with this process and to Amy and my colleagues. Thank you. Any other comments? Mr. Postema. You are on mute, Mr. Postema. We cannot hear you. Okay now we can. Okay.
01:14:16.487: >> So, no, you covered everything that I was going to remi you earlier. So thank you very much that the process, and I make a note for Mr. Gearhart that the numbers will be supplemented with the names in the resolution when appropriate.
