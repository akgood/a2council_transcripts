00:00:29.221: >> City Admin. Lazarus: THANK YOU, MAYOR. I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE OUR REPRESENTATIVES FROM SEMCOG GO FIRST. I WILL SNEAK OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE.
00:00:39.698: >> GOOD EVENING. THANK YOU FOR HAVING US HERE. I'M AMY MALMER AND WITH ME IS TREVOR BRIDER HE'S A TRANSPORTATION PLANNER. WE WILL GIVE YOU A BRIEF PRESENTATION. OUR EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SENDS HER REGRETS, BUT WE DO HAVE A VIDEO THANKING YOU FOR RECENTLY RENEWING YOUR MEMBERSHIP. IT'S 90 SECONDS. I WILL START WITH THAT AND THEN WE WILL GET RIGHT INTO OUR PRESENTATION.
00:01:06.625: >> THANKS FOR RENEWING YOUR MEMBERSHIP IN SEMCOG. BECAUSE OF YOU, WE ARE ABLE TO LEVERAGE DATA, PLANNING AND COLLABORATION INTO IMPORTANT INITIATIVES THAT BENEFIT THE ENTIRE REGIONAL. LET'S SHARE A FEW OF THEM WITH. YOU WE BRING IT TO LIFE THROUGH VISUALIZATION AND INTERACTIVE MAPS, WHICH PROVIDES ACCESS TO POPULATION AND DEVELOPMENT TRENDS. WE WORK WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO IMPLEMENT OUR PLANS, OFFERING ASSISTANCE WITH ON-THE-GROUND SOLUTIONS. WE PROJECT AN PLAN FOR THE FUTURE OF OUR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM, PRIORITIZING MOBILITY SOLUTIONS THAT DRIVE OUR ECONOMY, SAFELY CONNECT PEOPLE AND PLACES AND PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT. WE ADVANCE THE REGION'S MECHANIC DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY IN PARTNERSHIP WITH STAKEHOLDERS FROM THE PUBLIC AND THE PRIVATE SECTORS. WE HELP TO COORDINATE THE OPPORTUNITIES FROM SOUTHEAST MICHIGAN, FEATURING TRAIL EXPLORER. WE BRING TOGETHER LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND PROVIDE A VOICE FOR THE REGION, ADVOCATING ON EISSUES IN LANSING AND WASHINGTON. THIS IS JUST A TASTE OF WHAT SEMCOG DOES WITH YOUR SUPPORT. NONE OF THIS WOULD BE POSSIBLE WITHOUT PARTICIPATION LIKE YOURS. THANK YOU FOR RENEWING YOUR MEMBERSHIP. WE LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR ACTIVE PARTICIPATION AND WORKING TOGETHER TO IMPROVE YOUR COMMUNITY AND OUR REGION.
00:02:33.712: >> ALL RIGHT. SO WE'LL GO INTO JUST A LITTLE MORE DETAIL ON THOSE THINGS. YES, HELP GETTING TO PO POWERPO, PLEASE. THANK YOU. PERFECT. THANKS SO MUCH. TONIGHT, WE ARE GOING TO PROVIDE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF OUR ORGANIZATION, A RECENT PLANNING ACTIVITIES IN THE AREAS OF TRANSPORTATION, ENVIRONMENT AND COMMUNITY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND OUR EFFORTS TO IMPLEMENT OUR PLANS HERE IN ANN ARBOR. AS YOU MAY KNOW, WE SERVE SEVEN COUNTIES OF SOUTHEAST MICHIGAN, CURRENT SEMCOG MEMBERS ARE SHADED ON THE MAP. ALL SEVEN COUNTIES ARE MEMBERS AS ARE MOST OF THE INTERMEDIATE SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES, INCLUDING THOSE INSTITUTIONS HERE IN WASHTENAW COUNTY. OUR FUNDING IS PROVIDED BY MEMBER DUES WHICH WE USE TO MATCH FEDERAL AND STATE GRANTS THAT PAY FOR DATA ACQUISITION AND ANALYSIS, PLANNING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO IMPROVE OUR REGION AND TO SUPPORT IMPLEMENTATION OF LOCAL PLANS. EACH MEMBER COMMUNITY VOTES TO JOIN SEMCOG, PAYS MEMBERSHIP DUES AND APPOINTED DELEGATES AND ALTERNATES TO SEMCOG'S GENERAL ASSEMBLY, WHICH IS OUR FULL MEMBERSHIP COMMITTEE. ANN ARBOR'S SELL GATE IS -- DELEGATE IS COUNCILMEMBER NELSON AND HER ALTERNATE IS COUNCILMEMBER SMITH. THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO VET ON BEHALF OF THE CITY AND ARE OUR KEY CONTACT PEOPLE. MEMBERSHIP AT SEMCOG IS ORGANIZATIONAL. SO YOU ARE ALL WELCOME TO ATTEND AND PARTICIPATE IN OUR MEETINGS, ATTEND WORKSHOPS AND CONTACT OUR STAFF FOR DATA OR INFORMATION THAT YOU MAY NEED FROM US. YOU ALL SHOULD BE RECEIVING OUR BIWEEKLY NEWSLETTER CALLED REGIONAL UPDATE WHICH IS A PRETTY QUICK WAY TO KEEP NOTIFIED OF OUR MEETINGS, OUR ACTIVITIES, OUR TRAINING SESSIONS, GRANT DEADLINES AND LEGISLATIVE ISSUES. YOU MIGHT ALSO CONSIDER GETTING MORE INVOLVED BY REQUESTING AN APPOINTMENT TO A TASK FORCE OR GETTING ELECTED TO SERVE ON A COMMITTEE. THESE ARE THE GROUPS WHERE MUCH OF SEMCOG'S WORK IS DONE. THERE ARE COMMITTEE ELECTIONS THAT TAKE PLACE EVERY JUNE AT OUR GENERAL ASSEMBLY MEETING. TASK FORCES ARE A PLACE WHERE YOU REQUEST APPOINTMENT AND COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD IS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THAT OPPORTUNITY BY SERVING ON OUR BICYCLE AND PEDESTRIAN TASK FORCE. AND AS THESE GROUPS ARE ALSO OPEN TO CITY STAFF, ELI COOPER IS A LONG-SERVING MEMBER OF OUR TRANSPORTATION COORDINATING COUNCIL AND MOLLY MACIEJEWSKI SERVED ON OUR FUTURE SKILLS TASK FORCE, WHICH JUST CONCLUDED WORK RECENTLY. AND I WILL JUST MENTION, ONE OF THE THINGS COMING OUT OF THAT TASK FORCE, WHICH WE'RE GEARING UP ON WILL PROBABLY BE STARTING TO USE MAYBE EARLY NEXT YEAR IS A PUBLIC EDUCATION CAMPAIGN TO BRING MORE AWARENESS TO PUBLIC SERVICE JOBS. SO WE ARE GOING TO HAVE SOME POSTERS WHERE LOCAL COMMUNITIES CAN ADD THEIR OWN INFORMATION, HUMAN RESOURCE DIRECTORS, THAT TYPE OF C CONTACT INFORMATION AD WE HOPE THAT THOSE POSTERS WILL BE UP THROUGHOUT THE REGION AT GOVERNMENT HALLS AND AT SCHOOLS. OUR GUIDING VISION AT SEMCOG IS -- OOPS. IS THAT ALL THE PEOPLE OF SOUTHEAST MICHIGAN BENEFIT FROM A CONNECTED THRIVING REGION OF SMALL TOWNS, DYNAMIC URBAN CENTERS, ACTIVE WATERFRONTS, PREMIER EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS, AND ABUNDANT AGO ARAGRICULTURAL AND RECREATIONAL RESOURCES. HIGH QUALITY DATA IS THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORK WE DO TO ACCOMPLISH THIS VISION. SEMCOG COLLECTS AND ANALYZES INFORMATION ON PEOPLE, THE ECONOMY AND JOBS, HOUSING, TRANSPORTATION, THE ENVIRONMENT AND LAND USE. OUR NEWEST MAPPING TOOL ALLOWS YOU TO VIEW VARIOUS COMMUNITY DATA AT THE SAME TIME. THIS EXAMPLE SHOWS ANN ARBOR'S TOTAL POPULATION ON THE MAP, AND THEN THE CHART ON THE LOWER LEFT IS SHOWING POPULATION DENSITY. WE ALSO HAVE FORECAST DATA WHICH PROJECTS THE REGION'S FUTURE ECONOMIC AND DEMOGRAPHIC OUTPUT AND ALL OF THIS INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE. OUR 2045 FORECAST DATA SHOWS THAT OUR DEMOGRAPHICS ARE CHANGING. OUR POPULATION IS BECOMING OLDER, AND OUR SCHOOL-AGED POPULATION IS DECREASING. WHEREAS FOR THE REGION, THE YEAR WHERE WE ARE PREDICTED TO HAVE MORE ON THE OLDER END AND FEWER ON THE YOUNGER END IS 2026 IT LOOKS LIKE HERE IN ANN ARBOR, YOU WILL SIT THAT TIPPING POINT JUST A LITTLE BIT EARLIER. THIS DYNAMIC IMPACTS HOW COMMUNITIES PLAN FOR THE FUTURE AND PROVIDE NEEDED SERVICES TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF RESIDENTS. AT THE SAME TIME AS WE HAVE GOT THIS CHANGING DEMOGRAPHIC, WE WILL HAVE FEWER PRIME WORKING-AGED PEOPLE THAN AVAILABLE JOBS. BECAUSE THIS WILL IMPACT OUR ECONOMIC GROWTH, THIS DYNAMIC WILL BE SOMETHING THAT OUR NEW REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY WILL ADDRESS AND TREVOR IS GOING TO TELL YOU HOW YOU CAN PROVIDE SOME INPUT TO THAT STRATEGY IN JUST A FEW MINUTES. ANOTHER WAY WE ENSURE DATA IS USEFUL AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IS WITH OUR INTERACTIVE MAPPING TOOL. THIS ALLOWS MEMBERS AND THE PUBLIC TO ZOOM IN TO SPECIFIC LOCATIONS IN THE REGION AND RECEIVE CUSTOMIZED DATA ON A WIDE RANGE OF TOPICS, INCLUDING EMPLOYMENT DENSITY AS YOU SEE HERE, TRAFFIC VOLUMES, COMMUTING PATTERNS, AND PAVEMENT CONDITIONS. THESE PAVEMENT CONDITIONS PROVIDE THE LATEST AVAILABLE RATING OF GOOD, FAIR OR POOR FOR ROADWAYS ACROSS THE REGION. WE SHARED THAT PAVEMENT INFORMATION WITH LEGISLATORS AND WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AS THEY ARE DISCUSSING ROAD FUNDING PROPOSALS. AS I SAID, ALL OF THIS INFORMATION CAN BE FOUND ON OUR WEBSITE. IN ADDITION, I ENCOURAGE YOU TO REACH OUT TO STEPHANIE TAYLOR WHO IS OUR INFORMATION CENTER STAFF PERSON. WE ALWAYS HAVE SOMEONE AVAILABLE TO HELP YOU BASED ON YOUR SPECIFIC NEEDS. AND WITH THAT, TREVOR IS GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT SOME OF THE PLANS THAT WE ARE WORKING ON.
00:09:09.174: >> THANK YOU, AMY, AND HELLO, EVERYONE. SEMCOG HAS A VARIETY OF PLANNING AREAS THAT WE ADDRESS FOR REGIONAL PLANNING. WE HAVE OUR TRAFFIC SAFETY PLAN, A BICYCLE AN PEDESTRIAN TRAVEL PLAN, GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN, ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY, WATER RESOURCES, PARKS AND RECREATION, AND OF COURSE, TRANSPORTATION. ALL OF THESE HAVE BEEN RENEWED AND PRODUCED OVER THE LAST THREE OR FOUR YEARS AND SO THEY GO I A CYCLE TO KEEP THEM FRESH AND UPDATED TO NEW TRENDS AND TO KEEP THEM AS UP-TO-DATE AS POSSIBLE. OUR 2045 REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLAN WAS JUST PASSED JANUARY OF THIS YEAR, AND CHARTS THE COURSE FOR MAINTAINING AND IMPROVING OUR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM INTO THE FUTURE AND MAKES US ELIGIBLE FOR $1 BILLION IN FEDERAL TRANSPORTATION MONEY ANNUALLY. THE PLAN EXPLAINS SEMCOG'S ROLE IN TRANSPORTATION PLANNING, THE CONNECTION TO OTHER REGIONAL PLANS AND THE IMPACT AND THE ECONOMY, THE ENVIRONMENT, AND INCLUDES PROJECTS, POLICIES AND ACTIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE PLAN. THE MORE SHORT-TERM IS OUR TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM. THIS IS OUR FOUR-YEAR IMPLEMENTATION OF -- OF ALL OF THE MONEY THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR -- OR THAT USES FEDERAL GRANTS AND IT'S -- AND ITS IMPLEMENTATION. THIS CHART SHOWS THE VALUE OF THE LOCAL TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS INVESTED IN WASHTENAW COUNTY FOR THE -- HELLO -- FOR THE FOUR-YEAR TIP FROM 2020 TO 2023, BY TYPE OF PROJECT. REFLECTING LOCAL PRIORITIES OVER HALF THE MONEY IS INVESTED IN TRANSIT IN WASHTENAW COUNTY AND ABOUT ONE-THIRD IN ROAD PAVEMENT PRESERVATION BETWEEN 2 AND 5% IN SAFETY, PED AND BIKE PROJECTS AND TRANSPORTATION OPERATIONS. THE NON-PAVEMENT PORTION OF THE -- OF THE PROJECT, WHILE THEY ARE SMALL ARE LARGER THAN WHAT IS USUALLY REPRESENTED IN OTHER COUNTIES IN THE SEMCOG REGION. ENSURING THE ROADWAYS IS SAFE IS A GOAL OF THE REGION'S TRAFFIC SAFETY PLAN, WHICH IDENTIFIES SAFETY NEEDS AND GUIDES INVESTMENT DECISIONS TO REDUCE FATALITIES AND INJURIES. IT BENCHMARKS TRAFFIC CRASHES AND IDENTIFIES PROBLEM AREAS. MOST IMPORTANTLY IT INCLUDES SPECIFIC STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES. AMY SHOWED INTERACTIVE MAPS AND SAFETY DATA IS INCLUDED IN THAT. OUR SAFETY MAP SHARES CRASH DATA THAT IS USABLE AND EASY TO UNDERSTAND AND FORMATS WITH -- AND FORMATS WITH COMMUNITIES. FOR EXAMPLE, OUR CRASH LOCATION MAP INCLUDES ALL CRASHES IN THE REGIONS OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS, BY CRASH SEVERITY, AS WELL AS OTHER KEY FACTORS, SUCH AS ALCOHOL, YOUNG DRIVER, PEDESTRIAN, AND BICYCLE-INVOLVED CRASHES. THIS INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL, SHOWN HERE ARE CRASHES IN ANN ARBOR OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS, AND IT'S ZOOMED IN TO GEDDES NEAR WASHTENAW. YOU CAN DIG IN EVEN FURTHER AND GET THE ACTUAL POLICE REPORT FOR THE INSIGHTING INCIDENT. INFORMATION ON EACH CRASH -- I SAID THAT. ONE OF THE MAIN SAFETY CONCERNS IN INCREASING CRASHES IS INVOLVING PEDESTRIANS AND BICYCLISTS. MORE AND MORE, WITH THEIR PEOPLE WALKING AND BIKING, AND ON OUR ROADWAYS AND NEEDING TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT AND THE RISK TO THEIR -- TO THEIR LIVES WHILE THEY DO SO. MORE CRASHES ARE LESS THAN 2% OF ALL TRAFFIC CRASHES, THEY ACCOUNT FOR OVER 28% OF ALL TRAFFIC-RELATED FATALITIES WHEN PEOPLE ARE HIT WHEN THEY ARE WALKING AND BIKING THAT'S MUCH MORE SEVERE. OUR SAFETY EDUCATION CAMPAIGN CALLED WALK, BIKE, DRIVE SAFE REFLECTS THE FACT THAT EVERYONE HAS A ROLE TO PLAY IN PEDESTRIAN BICYCLE SAFETY. HOPEFULLY HAVE YOU SEEN THE MESSAGING OR THE BIKE LIGHTS AND THE WRIST BANDS WE REQUIRED. ELI HAS REQUESTED THIS INFORMATION THROUGHOUT THE CITY. I THINK I, MYSELF, HAVE SEEN THEM AROUND THE AREA. SEMCOG ASSISTS COMMUNITIES IN PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTING BICYCLE AND PEDESTRIAN PROJECTS AND IN THE REGION WE HAVE OVER 3,000 MILES OF BIKEWAYS AND PATHWAYS. EARLIER THIS YEAR, WE LAUNCHED A BICYCLE AND PEDESTRIAN TASK FORCE. I BELIEVE COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD IS PART OF THIS GROUP WHICH IS CURRENTLY WORKING TO DEVELOP A PLAN FOR BIKING A WALKING AND BG PLANS ACROSS THE REGION. AND WE HAVE A ONE-STOP SHOP FOR ALL THE BIKING FACILITIES IN THE REGIONS, AS THREE   FACILITIES HAVE PROLIFERATED THROUGHOUT THE REGION. WE HAVE AN UPDATED GUIDE FOR WHAT IS AVAILABLE IN THE REGION AND IDENTIFY MAPS AND PRIORITIES AND THE EXPANSION OF THESE FACILITIES. AND WITH TRANSIT, SEMCOG COORDINATES WITH TRANSIT AUTHORITIES AND REGIONAL TRANSIT TO COLLECT DATA AND PLANNING. MAP SHOWN HERE IS THE TRANSIT ACCESS MAP THAT IS PART OF THE SEMCOG MAP GALLERY. THE BLUE REGIONS SHOW THE APPROXIMATE WALK TIME FROM TRANSIT STOPS. THE RIDE, THE RTA AND SEMCOG ARE CURRENTLY COORDINATING ON A PILOT SERVICE FOR A BUS BETWEEN ANN ARBOR AND DETROIT THAT WILL TIP PROVIDING A TRANSIT OPTION -- CONTINUE PROVIDING A TRANSIT OPTION WHEN THE UNIVERSITY OF MESH MISCH SERVICE STOPS AND HELPS TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE -- THE SERVICE WILL ALSO PROVIDE DATA ON THE DEMAND FOR THE SERVICE IN THE FUTURE, WHICH WILL CONTRIBUTE TO OUR CASE FOR -- FOR PILOTING A COMMUTER RAIL SERVICE. SEMCOG'S ENVIRONMENTAL EFFORTS FOCUS ON POLICY AND THE QUALITY OF MICHIGAN'S WATER, AIR AND LAND. SOUTHEAST MICHIGAN'S LAKES, RIVERS AND WETLANDS DEFINE THE REGION'S GEOGRAPHY AND ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE ECONOMIC HEALTH, ATTRACTING VISITORSORS ENHANCING QUALITY OF LIFE FOR RESIDENTS. SEMCOG'S WATER RESOURCES PLAN FOCUSES ON BLUE ECONOMY, WHICH IS THE ECONOMIC IMPACT THAT WATER HAS ON OUR REGION. NATURAL RESOURCES, WHICH INCLUDES ISSUES RELATED TO PROTECTING OR RIVERS, STREAMS, WETLANDS AND WOODLANDS AND INFRASTRUCTURE, , FOCUSING ON TE WASTEWATER, AND STORMWATER SYSTEMS. IT PROVIDES AN INTEGRATED WATER MANAGEMENT RESOURCE APPROACH TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT EACH OF THESE. AN IMPORTANT PART OF IMPLEMENTING THIS PLAN IS MAPPING AND COLLECTING DATA FOR OUR REGION'S UNDERGROUND INFRASTRUCTURE, FOR THE STUFF BURIED UNDERNEATH THE MAJOR ROADWAYS. WE HAVE MUCH LESS INFORMATION AND IT BECOMES MUCH MORE SALIENT THAT WE KNOW THAT. WE APPRECIATE ANN ARBOR FOR PROVIDING DATA. THE DATE IS NOW IN FULL SWING. AS YOU KNOW INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS ARE ESSENTIAL TO ECONOMIC PROSPERITY AND QUALITY OF LIFE. UNDERSTANDING THE CONDITION AND THE NEEDS OF THESE SYSTEMS ALLOWS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS BEFORE INVESTING IN COSTLY IMPROVEMENTS. KNOWING THE CONDITIONS OF ASSETS AND STRENGTHENING COORDINATION ON PROJECTS WILL SAVE MONEY, MINIMIZE INCONVENIENCE TO THE PUBLIC AND GIVE US A STRONGER VOICE IN COMMUNICATING THESE ITEMS. I ENCOURAGE YOU -- YOUR CONTINUED INVOLVEMENT IN THIS PROGRAM, WHICH WILL ALLOW LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO BE REIMBURSED TORE PROVIDING ASSET DATA, DRINKING WATER -- FOR DRINKING WATER, WASTEWATER AND STORMWATER INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS. ANOTHER PART OF IMPLEMENTING THE WATER RESOURCES PLAN WAS THROUGH EDUCATING THE PUBLIC. SEMCOG CREATES THE ONE WATER CAMPAIGN IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE GREAT LAKES WATER SOCIETY. THE CONCEPT WHICH IS ILLUSTRATES IN THIS LOGO, TO MAKE THE BRIGHTEST POSSIBLE FUTURE, IT'S ESSENTIAL THAT WE RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANT AND THE INTERCONNECTEDNESS OF OUR WATER SYSTEMS. OUR SLOGAN IS:  KEEP IT FRESH, KEEP IT FLOWING. THE CAMPAIGN FOCUSES ON THREE AREAS, THE FORM WATER, WASTEWATER AND DRINKING WATER, WHICH IS THE OVERALL CONCERN FOR THE UNDERGROUND INFRASTRUCTURE. WE'RE ALSO WORKING TO IMPLEMENTING THE GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE VISION FOR SOUTHEAST MICHIGAN. GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE INCLUDES PARKS, LAKES, WETLANDS AND TREES AND CONSTRUCTED GREEN ROOFS AND BIOSWAILS AND RAIN GARDENS. FEATURED HERE IS THE GREEN MAP FOR WASHTENAW COUNTY. THE REGION'S ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK FOR OUR PUBLIC AND PRIVATE ENTITY TO WORK TOGETHER TO INCREASE OUR REGION'S PROSPERITY. WE ARE IN THE EARLY STAGES OF UPDATING THE STRATEGY, WHICH WILL FOCUS ON THREE AREAS, PLACE, BUSINESS, AND TALENT. OVER THE SUMMER WE HOSTED FORMS ON PLACE AND BUSINESS. THIS MONTH, WE WILL HAVE A FORM ON TALENT THAT'S ON SEPTEMBER 11th. MORE IMPORTANTLY, I WANT YOU TO KNOW WE WILL BE HOSTING A FORUM HERE IN THE COUNTY THAT WILL FOCUS ON ALL THREE OF THESE FOCUS. IT WILL BE HELD IN PITTSFIELD TOWNSHIP HALL. MORE INFORMATION WILL BE SENT VIA EMAIL AND AVAILABLE THROUGH REGIONAL UPDATE. AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF BOTH ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL PRIORITIES IS OUR PARKS AND RECREATION SOURCES. AS SUCH EARLIER THIS YEAR, WE DEVELOPED A PARKS AND RECREATION PLAN ON ENSURING THAT WE MEET THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF BOTH RESIDENTS AND VISITORS. OUR SOUTHEAST MICHIGAN PARK FOUNDER IS PART OF THE DEVELOPING PLAN AS WE COLLECTED PARK DATA AND CREATED A MOBILE APP. IT HAS INFORMATION ON RECREATION OPPORTUNITIES FOR OVER 2600 PARKS IN THE REGION. FOR ANY OF THE -- FOR ANY PARK IN THE REGION, A LIST OF AMENITIES AND INFORMATION LIKE SIZE AND OWNERSHIP IS PROVIDED, AND DETAILED ON THE SCREEN. THERE'S THE POP-UP THERE IS THE PARK AT WINEWOOD AND THALER PARK. IT GIVES A LIST OF AMENITIES AT EACH INDIVIDUAL PARK. ON THE TRAIL SIDE, WE HAVE MAPPED OVER 1,000 MILES OF MAJOR WATER AND LAND TRAILS, 360-DEGREE IMAGES, SIMILAR TO GOOGLE STREET VIEW. IT HAS -- THE BORDER TO BORDER TRAIL IS THE PICTURE SHOWN HERE AND THERE IS ALSO A PICTURE OF THE WATER TRAILS. THIS IS AT THE HURON RIVER WATER TRAIL. WE HAVE USED THESE VISUAL MAPS FOR PLANNING AND SHOWCASE THE REGIONAL TRAIL MAPS FOR BOTH RESIDENTS AND VISITORS. SEMCOG IS ALSO ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN LEGISLATIVE ISSUES, IMPORTANT TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THROUGHOUT SOUTHEAST MICHIGAN. WE ADOPTED THE LEGISLATIVE POLICY PLATFORM LAST DECEMBER, THE PLATFORM FOCUSES ON THE NEED FOR INVESTMENT IN THE REGION'S INFRASTRUCTURE, WORKFORCE, COMMUNITIES AND NATURAL ASSETS. WE ADVOCATE IN BOTH WASHINGTON AND LANSING ON BEHALF OF OUR MEMBERS. OUR PRIORITIES INCLUDE INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING FOR ROAD, SEWER, WATER AND STORM, INCLUDING SUPPORT FOR THE CURRENT BILL PROPOSING THE CREATION OF A STORMWATER MANAGEMENT -- FOR STORM WALTER R MANAGEMENT UTILITIES. THIS IS HOUSE BILL 4691. MAINTAINING CDBG FUNDING, SUPPORT FOR THE CENSUS AND SUPPORTING PROGRAMS THAT ADDRESS EDUCATION AND TRAINING AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT FINANCE. WE HAVE ALSO BEEN SHARING OUR POLICY POSITIONS WITH LEGISLATURES REPRESENTING THE REGION BOTH IN WASHINGTON AND LANSING, ENCOURAGING THEM TO USE US AS A RESOURCE. WE ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGED WITH GOVERNOR WHITMER AND HER ADMISSION. PLEASE WATCH REGIONAL UPDATE FOR INFORMATION ON LEGISLATION THAT SEMCOG IS MONITORING AND FOR WAYS TO ENGAGE YOUR LEGISLATURES. OUR NEXT GENERAL ASSEMBLY WILL TAKE PLACE ON OCTOBER 17th IN TROY, MICHIGAN, AT THE MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY MANAGEMENT EDUCATION CENTER. THESE -- THIS GENERAL ASSEMBLY WILL FEATURE WORKSHOP SESSIONS, ACROSS A VARIETY OF TOPIC THAT'S TOUCH ON EVERY ASPECT OF THE PLANNING THAT WE WENT OVER. SO A SAVE THE DATE CARD WILL BE SENT OUT SHORTLY AND YOU CAN LOOK FOR THAT SOON. YOU ARE WELCOME TO AND ENCOURAGED TO CONNECT WITH US OVER SOCIAL MEDIA AT ANY OF THE LISTED OUTLETS, FACEBOOK, TWITTER AND LINKEDIN. WE ALSO HAVE ADDITIONAL SEMCOG-PRODUCED VIDEOS AND PODCASTS THAT YOU CAN CHECK OUT BY GOING TO OUR WEBSITE. AND A SEMCOG APP THAT PROVIDES EASING ACCESS TO MEETING INFORMATION AND DIRECTIONS TO OUR OFFICE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND ARE QUESTIONS NEXT OR IS IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WE'LL SEE YOU NEXT YEAR?
00:22:42.386: >> Mayor Taylor: IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS. IF FOLKS HAVE QUESTIONS, WE CAN CERTAINLY ENTERTAIN SOME QUESTIONS. COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
00:22:48.626: >> Councilmember Griswold: WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE DATABASE FOR CRASHES. I KNOW THAT MICHIGAN TRAFFIC CRASH FACTS ALSO HAS AN INTERFACE. I'M WONDERING WHO MAINTAINS THE ACTUAL DATABASE FOR THE U.D.-10s. IS IT THE STATE PLACE OR --
00:23:03.708: >> THE STATE PLACE MIN  MAINTAIN UD-10s. WE CAN CALL THEM AND SERVE THEM UP THROUGH OUR WEBSITE, BUT IT'S USING THAT CENTRAL SOURCE FOR THE MICHIGAN STATE POLICE.
00:23:16.120: >> Councilmember Griswold: OKAY. SO THE STATE POLICE HAVE AN I.T. DEPARTMENT THAT MAINTAINS THE UD-10 DATA?
00:23:21.926: >> I BELIEVE THAT IS THE CASE.
00:23:24.462: >> Councilmember Griswold: OH, OKAY. THANKS.
00:23:27.198: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER QUESTIONS? COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
00:23:29.634: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES, THANK YOU. ONE GENERAL WE. THERE'S ONE SLIDE. YOU SHOWED THAT THERE'S THE -- THE $20 MILLION TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENT ALLOCATIONS ARE SPREAD --
00:23:44.882: >> OH, THE PIE CHART.
00:23:46.150: >> Councilmember Lumm: AND HOW THAT IS ALLOCATED. JUST A GENERAL QUESTION DO OUR ALLOCATIONS, DO THEY MIRROR WHAT OTHER COUNTIES IN SOUTHEAST MICHIGAN T TYPICALLY SPENT THOSE DOLLARS. WE SPENT A LOT ON TRANSIT.
00:24:03.501: >> WE DO SPENT -- TYPICALLY IT'S HALF THE SPEND IS ON TRANSIT AND THE OTHER IS PAVEMENT. IT CANNOT BE TRANSITIONED ALL THAT EASILY. SO THE MORE UNIQUE SHAPE OF THE WASHTENAW COUNTY PIE IS THAT THERE ARE MORE -- THERE'S MORE MONEY SPENT ON SAFETY -- SAFETY PROJECTS, PED AND BIKE PROJECTS AND SO SOME THE MINOR CATEGORIES THAT ARE THERE. WASHTENAW COUNTY HAS A SLIGHTLY LARGER --
00:24:45.910: >> Councilmember Lumm: OTHER COUNTIES DON'T SPEND IT IN THESE AREAS? THEY HAVE MORE OF THEIR MONEY ON PAVEMENT PRESERVATION THAN PAVEMENT PRESERVATION ONLY. IT'S A -- WE ARE OFTEN ENCOURAGED PEOPLE TO LOOK FOR A MIX AND OFTEN LOOK FOR PROJECTS THAPROJECTSTHAT BUILD SEVERAL FN DEPENDING WHAT THE COMMUNITY'S NEEDS ARE. PAVEMENT IS IN POOR CONDITION ALL AROUND THE REGION, AND SO IT'S AN EASY CALL TO SPEND MONEY ON PAVEMENT, UNFORTUNATELY THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT'S AVAILABLE FOR SPENDING ON TRANSPORTATION ALL TOGETHER IS WOEFULLY SHORT. WE ESTIMATE THAT WE NEED TO BE SPENDING ABOUT THREE-TIMES THE AMOUNT OF MONEY ANNUALLY TO GET US UP TO A STATE OF GOOD OR FAIR CONDITION IN A DECADE. AND SO EVEN IF OTHERS WERE SWITCHED OVER TO PAVEMENT, WE WOULDN'T SEE A MARKED INCREASE IN PAVEMENT CONDITION.
00:25:36.227: >> Councilmember Lumm: RIGHT. OKAY. THANK YOU.
00:25:38.562: >> Mayor Taylor: OTHER QUESTIONS? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
00:25:41.232: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. AND THANK YOU FOR COMING TONIGHT AND SHARING THIS INFORMATION. I GOT A QUESTION THAT KIND OF GOES ALONG WITH COUNCILMEMBER LUMM AND YOU TOUCHED ON, A BIG CHUNK OF MONEY GOING TOWARDS TRANSIT AND THE WHOLE RTA INITIATIVE COMING BACK TO US. HOW WILL THAT AFFECT OR WHAT IS SEMCOG'S POSITION? IS THERE ANYTHING -- I HEARD SOME CONVERSATIONS BUT SINCE YOU ARE HERE TONIGHT, HOW THAT WILL FIT INTO THIS, IT'S OBVIOUSLY A SMALLER REGIONAL AUTHORITY THAN SEMCOG. SO IF YOU CAN KIND OF EXPLAIN TO US HOW THAT MIGHT MESH WITH WHAT WE ARE LISTENING TO HEAR WITH THESE NUMBERS?
00:26:22.473: >> SO YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT OUR RELATIONSHIP IS WITH THE REGIONAL TRANSIT AUTHORITY AND WHAT THE --
00:26:27.478: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  IF IT'S APPROVED IN 2020, BECAUSE THEY WANT TO COME BACK ONE MORE TIME.
00:26:34.251: >> RIGHT. MY UNDERSTANDING OF -- FIRST OF ALL, SEMCOG ISN'T SUPPORTIVE OF THE RTA. THEY HOLD -- THEI THEIR DESKS AN HOUR BUILDING AND WE TRY TO PLUM THEM WITH SERVICE AND DATA AND SO FORTH, AS THEY ARE MAKING THEIR PLANS AND STRATEGY. THEY DON'T COVER THE ENTIRE REGION. WE MAKE PLANS FOR THE NON- RTA COUNTIES THROUGHOUT THE REGION. I BELIEVE THE RTA IS FORMING A NEW PLAN THAT IS YET TO BE VOTED ON, THAT ADDRESSES MANY OF THEIR CONCERNS LAST TIME THE VOTE TOOK PLACE. AND THEY ARE WEIGHING THE TIMING OF A POTENTIAL NEW VOTE DEPENDING ON THE FEELING OF THEIR BOARD AND SO FORTH. SO IF THE -- I GUESS I CAN'T REALLY SPECULATE ABOUT WHAT TYPE OF ASK THEY WILL BE MAKING THIS NEXT TIME. BUT ASSUMING THAT IT WILL BE AROUND THE SAME SCALE, MAYBE DISTRIBUTED DIFFERENTLY, MAYBE A LITTLE BIT LESS, A LITTLE BIT MORE, THAT WILL BE ABOUT A DOUBLING OF TRANSIT EXPENDITURES OR INVESTMENTS IN THE REGION AND SO THE ANN ARBOR ALREADY SPENDS A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES ON TRANSIT, AND SO THERE WILL WILL BE A LOT LESS REGIONAL CONNECTIONS IN ANN ARBOR. I KNOW THIS WAS A CONCERN THAT THERE WON BE AS GOOD OF VALUE IN PARTICIPATING IN THE RTA THAT CAME OUT. AND SO I KNOW THE RTA IS COGNIZANT OF THAT AND WORKING TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S A GOOD VALUE PROPOSITION FOR ALL THE MEMBER COUNTIES.
00:28:20.724: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  ALL RIGHT. I APPRECIATE THAT.
00:28:23.494: >> Mayor Taylor: ANY OTHER QUESTIONS? THANK YOU. I'M SORRY, COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
00:28:29.600: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES. WE HAVE BEEN DOING A LOT OF WORK ON OUR ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION ABOUT TREES AND LANDMARK TREES AND HERITAGE TREES AND WORKING WITH THE WASHTENAW COUNTY ROAD TO MINIMIZE THE PESTICIDE ALONG THE ROADWAYS. SO WHEN YOU MENTIONED WOODLAND AND GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE AND SUCH, HAVE YOU SEEN ANY NEW TRENDS OR CHANGES WITH -- IN LIGHT OF THOSE FEATURES.
00:29:01.932: >> WE CORRECT A LOT OF AERIAL IMAGERY AND IT'S BEEN A FEW YEARS THAT WE DID AN ANALYSIS FOR A TREE CANOPY LAYER. UNFUNFORTUNATELY WE HAVEN'T DONA SECOND RUN OF THAT ANALYSIS, AND SO WE DON'T HAVE A TREND. WEO HAVE OVERALL TREE COVER BY COUNTY AS A BASELINE, AS BASELINE INFORMATION FOR US, AND SO WE WE'RE GENERALLY ENCOURAGIG AND THEY ACT AS A FAIRLY GOOD BREAK FOR RAIN AND RUNOFF AND SO ARE WANTING TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF TREES THAT ARE IN OUR REGION IN GENERAL THROUGHOUT BOTH URBAN AND RURAL AREAS.
00:29:50.047: >> Mayor Taylor: GREAT. FURTHER QUESTIONS?
00:29:51.849: >> Councilmember Hayner:  JUST ONE OF ACCESS.
00:29:53.684: >> Mayor Taylor: PLEASE, COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
00:29:55.119: >> Councilmember Hayner:  HOW IS THE MAP OVERLAY AVAILABLE TO US?
00:29:59.023: >> IF YOU GO TO OUR WEBSITE -- YES, YOU ARE ALWAYS -- ANYTHING YOU DON'T FIND HERE, YOU ARE ABLE TO EMAIL SEMCOG OR CALL ONE OF US AND ASK SPECIFICALLY, BUT WE HAVE DONE A WHOLE LOT OF SURFACING A LOT OF OUR DATA ON OUR WEBSITE AND WE GOT BETTER AT INTERACTIVE MAPPING. ON OUR WEBSITE WE HAVE A MAP GALLERY THAT CAN POINT YOU TO ALL THE INTERACTIVE MAPS THAT YOU HAVE THAT GO ACROSS ALL THE SUBJECT AREAS THAT WE HAVE AND WE ARE ALWAYS LOOK TO IMPROVE THOSE MAPS AND MAKE THE DATA MORE AND MORE AVAILABLE TO JUST POINTING AND CLICKING RATHER THAN NEEDING TO DOWNLOAD ACCESS TABLES AND THINGS LIKE THAT.
00:30:42.299: >> Councilmember Hayner: OKAY. THANK YOU.
00:30:44.201: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? THANK YOU SO MUCH.
00:30:47.404: >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MAYOR.
00:31:06.590: >> City Admin. Lazarus: READY? I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE REPRESENTATIVES FROM SEMCOG FOR COMING AND SHARING THEIR DATA AND THE OVERVIEW OF THE SERVICES THAT THEY PROVIDE TO THE REGION. WE WILL SHIFT GEARS A LITTLE BIT, AND WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE SOLID WASTE UPDATES AND SPECIFICALLY THE SOLID WASTE RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PLAN. AND WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO IS PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT OF AN OVERVIEW AND TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE DESIRED OUTCOMES. SO FOR TONIGHT, FOR THIS WORK SESSION IN THE COMING WEEKS, WE WANT TO FIND THE DETAIL AND THE BACKGROUND FOR COUNCIL AND THE RECENT EFFORTS RELATED TO OUR SOLID WASTE PROGRAMS. AND YOU CAN SEE THE SUB BULLETS THERE. WE NEED TO GAIN AN UNDERSTANDING OF COUNCIL'S INITIAL THOUGHTS AND REACTIONS TO THE REGIONAL MANAGEMENT AUTHORITY MEMBERSHIP, AND ALSO THE RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PLAN RECOMMENDATIONS, AND THEN GET YOUR INFORMATION TO TAKE PACK TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION, AND OBTAIN CLOSURE ON THE SOLID WASTE RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PLAN. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE AT THE LAST MEETING OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION, THE COMMISSION DID NOT MAKE A RECOMMENDATION. AND THERE WERE SOME POINTS THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED CONTENTIOUS THAT CAME UP. AT THAT TIME, RATHER THAN BRING SOMETHING FORWARD WITHOUT THE RECOMMENDATION, WE THOUGHT THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY TO GET THROUGH THOSE CONCERNS WAS TO COME BACK TO COUNCIL, TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS WORK SESSION, GET YOUR FEEDBACK, INTEGRATE THAT BACK INTO THE PLAN, AND HAVE ANOTHER DISCUSSION WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP AT THEIR NEXT MEETING AND COME BACK TO COUNCIL. THERE'S A SENSE OF URGENCY AND IMMEDIACY TO GET THROUGH THAT PROCESS AND TO GET COUNCIL'S GUIDANCE. SEVER KEY DECIS HAVE TO BE MADE, BOTH NOW AND AS WE SAID INTO THE BUDGET PROCESS, CONCERNING PARTNERING, CONTRACTING, EQUIPMENT REPLACEMENT AN PROCUREMENT. AND THOSE THINGS, WHILE JUNE MAY SEEM A LONG WINTER AWAY, WE KNOW THAT TIME GOES BY QUICKLY AND WE ARE REALLY LOOKING AT NINE MONTHS TO BE PREPARED TO MOVE ON TO THE NEXT PHASE OF HOW WE MANAGE SOLID WASTE IN THE COMMUNITY. THE SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT PLAN DID DEVELOP PLANS FOR COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT. I KNOW THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT CAME UP. IN ADDITION TO THE STAKEHOLDER GROUP, THE COMMU COMMUNITY SURVS CONDUCTED. THE RESULTS FROM THE RECENT NATIONAL CITIZENS SURVEY WERE ALSO CONSIDERED AND ALL PROSPECTIVES WERE THOROUGHLY LOOKED AT AND IMPLEMENTED IN THE PLAN'S RECOMMENDATION. THERE WAS CONCERN THAT THE RESOURCE -- THE SOLID WASTE RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PLAN DID NOT ADDRESS PERFORMANCE OUTCOMES. WELL, THE GOALS THAT ARE IN THE SUSTAINABILITY FRAMEWORK ARE STILL APPLICABLE AND WE WILL INTEGRATE THOSE INTO THE FINAL DOCUMENT. THOSE GOALS INCLUDE THE AENVIACHIEVEMENT OF 40%, AND COT SELECTION AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A FAST FATS, OILS AND GREASE IMPLY. LEATION AND IMPROVED SERVICES IN THE DOWNTOWN. AND AT THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION, THOSE GOALS WILL BE RESTATED. THERE WAS CONCERN THAT STAFFER DOES NOT HAVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND I WILL TELL YOU THAT WE DO HAVE THOSE FOR RECYCLING AND SOLID WASTE. WE LOOK AT THE TOTAL TONNAGE OF WHAT COMES IN. WE DO LOOK AT HOW MUCH IS DIVERTED. WE LOOK AT RESIDUAL RATES AS WELL. WE ALSO TRACK MIXED PICKUP -- MISSED MMISSED PICKUPS, AND THOE BROUGHT INTO THE PLAN. THE SOLID WASTE MANAGE. RESOURCE PLAN WAS ALSO INTENDED TO PROVIDE A IF MANICALLY SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS APPROACH FOR OUR OPERATIONS. WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE LONG-TERM HEALTH OF THE SOLID WASTE PLAN. WE ALSO KNOW THAT THERE'S A LIMIT TO HOW MANY MIDGE AS WE CAN IMPOSE UPON OUR RATEPAYERS AND TAXPAYERS IN LOOKING AT THE AFFORDABILITY OF THE COMMUNITY. SO MAKING SOME TOUGH CALLS, YOU CAN MEET THE NEEDS THE COMMUNITY. THIS IS A FUTURE LOOKING, FORWARD LOOKING PLAN AS WELL. AND THEREFORE, WE SHOULD REALLY ALL EXPECT THAT THERE WILL BE SOME TOUGH CHOICES TO MAC MAKE E LOOK AT OUR RELATIONSHIPS, BOTH PAST, CURRENT AND FUTURE. THOSE ARE THINGS THAT MR. HUPY AND MR. SLOTTEN WILL TALK ABOUT, AND THEN I'M SURE THAT WE'LL HAVE A VERY GOOD CONVERSATION AFTER THAT. AGAIN, OUR INTENT IS TO TAKE COUNCIL'S INPUT, MODIFY THE PLAN, GO BACK TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION, AND THEN PRESENT THIS BACK TO COUNCIL AT ONE OF YOUR MEETINGS IN OCTOBER SO WE CAN GET IT FORMALLY ACCEPTED. SO WITH THAT, I'M GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO MANY HUPY AND REJOIN YOU ON THE DAIS.
00:35:58.482: >> THANK YOU. FIRST OF ALL, I WANT TO INTRODUCE STAFF THAT ARE HERE WITH ME TONIGHT. THERE'S CRESSON SLOTTEN, PUBLIC SERVICES AREA. MOLLY MACIEJEWSKI, PUBLIC SERVICES, BUT OPERATIONS AND PUBLIC WORKS. AND MARTY PERSHON WHO IS OUR CHIEF OF STAFF AND KEEPS US ALL ORGANIZED AND HEADED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. I WANT TO EMPHASIZE A COUPLE OF POINTS AS WE GO THROUGH THE PLAN TONIGHT, IS WE ARE LOOKING FOR YOUR DIRECTION, BUT HAVING TO STRESS TO YOU, THAT THIS IS NOT AN ALAN AL A CARTE PLAN. WE CAN'T PICK ITEM ONE AND NOT PICK TWO. THERE'S A STRONG RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE ELEMENTS IN THE PLAN. AS WE LOOK TO GO FORWARD, IF WE ARE GOING TO DO -- FOR EXAMPLE, IF WE ARE GOING TO DO YEAR ROUND COMPOST, IT MEANS WE HAVE TO BRING RECYCLING IN HOUSE TO GAIN THE SAVINGS SO THAT WE CAN GO YEAR-ROUND COMPOST AND OTHER PROGRAMS WITH THAT SAVINGS. SO THE PLAN IS INTERRELATED TO EACH ELEMENT. AND STRESSING THAT WE NEED DIRECTION QUICKLY. THE LEAD TIME ON VEHICLES IS NINE MONTHS OR LONGER. SO IF WE WANT TO MAKE A TRANSITION IN JUNE, DO YOU THE MATH BACKWARDS, WE SHOULD BE MAKING DECISIONS ON VEHICLES ALMOST TODAY. SO WHETHER WE END UP BRINGING SERVICES IN HOUSE OR WE HAVE CONTRACTORS DOING THE WORK, THEY NEED LEAD TIME FOR VEHICLES. SO THAT'S CRITICAL THAT WE MOVE FORWARD IN A RAPID FASHION. AND WITH THAT, I WILL TURN IT OVER TO STAFF.
00:38:22.993: >> THANK YOU, CRAIG. GOOD EVENING, MAYOR, COUNCIL. EYE CRESSON SLOTT SLOT -- I'M CN SLOTTEN WITH THE PUBLIC SERVICES AREA. TONIGHT HAS BEEN OUTLINED. WE HAVE BROKEN OUR PRESENTATION UP INTO A COUPLE OF SECTIONS. WANT TO BEGIN FOCUSED. IT SHOULDN'T TAKE TOO MUCH TIME BUT PROVIDE BACKGROUND AND INFORMATION ON THE WRRMA AUTHORITY, THE WASHTENAW REGIONAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AUTHORITY THAT WAS PRESENTED TO COUNCIL IN THE SPRING AND THE COUNCIL'S DECISION WAS TO TABLE THAT UNTIL THE SOLID WASTE UPDATE WAS COMPLETED. WE WANTED TO PROVIDE BACKGROUND THAT SEEMED WERE LACKING AND ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS THAT WERE ASKED AT THAT TIME SO WE CAN PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION THAN PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED AND PROVIDE THE STATUS OF THAT AUTHORITY, AS IT STANDS AND THEN WE'LL TAKE A QUICK PAUSE AND SEE IF WE HAVE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS AROUND THAT, AND THEN BEING SENSITIVE TO TIME. WE HAVE A LOT OF INFORMATION IN THE SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT PLAN AS WELL. I WILL TRY TO KEEP US ON TRACK. FOLLOWING THAT, WE WILL GO THROUGH THE SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT PLAN AND PROVIDE BACKGROUND ON THE OVERVIEW OF THE PLAN. HOWARD AND CRAIG HAD A GOOD JOB OF SETTING THE ST STAGE, BUT THY REALLY. AND THEN I WILL TRANSITION OVER TO MOLLY MACIEJEWSKI FOR THE RECOMMENDATION SECTION AS SHE WILL BE HEADING UP THE GROUP THAT IMPLEMENTS ANY RECOMMENDATIONS THAT COME OUT TO OUR OPERATIONS FOLKS. AND THEN I WILL WRAP UP A COUPLE OF QUICK ITEMS BUT T T THEY ARE INTERRELATED. THE EXPIRING CONTRACTS THAT MR. HUPY MENTIONED AND STAFFING, IT MAY RESULT OUT OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS. AND THEN OPEN IT UP ONE LAST TIME FOR ANY REMAINING -- ANY QUESTIONS ON THE PLAN ITSELF AND ANYTHING ELSE THAT REMAINS. AND SO TO MOVE THROUGH THAT, I WILL BEGIN WITH WRRMA AND THE WASHTENAW COUNTY AND WORK WITH THE COUNTY ON THAT. VERY BRIEFLY, FIRST TO SET THE STAGE, COUNTIES IN THE STATE OF MICHIGAN ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE SOLID WASTE PLANS IN PLACE BY THE STATE. SO WASHTENAW COUNTY SAW THAT THEY NEEDED TO UPDATE AN AMEND THEIR PLAN IN 2015, AND SO IN AUGUST THEY FORMED A COMMITTEE TO DO THAT WORK AND WE HAD A STAFF MEMBER THAT ACTUALLY SAT ON THAT COMMITTEE, AND RECOMMENDED THE LOCAL MUNICIPALITY PERSPECTIVE FOR THAT EFFORT. A COUPLE OF KEY THINGS TO POINT OUT ON THE SLIDE HERE OF THE GOAL THAT REALLY LEADS INTO THE IDEA OF A REGIONAL AUTHORITY, FIRST WAS A FUNDAMENTAL GUIDING PRINCIPLE ABOUT WORKING TOGETHER TO HAVE GREATER IMPACT AND COST BENEFIT. COMMUNITIES CAN HAVE THAT GREATER BENEFIT COLLABORATIVELY RATHER THAN WORKING INDIVIDUALLY. SO THAT WAS A FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF THAT PLAN. AND THEN TWO SPECIFIC GOALS THAT I HAVE HIGHLIGHTED IN THAT PLAN. GOAL NUMBER THREE, IN TERMS OF DEVELOPING, SUPPORTING, MONITORING, COMPREHENSIVE OUTREACH, FEEDBACK PROGRAMS TO SUPPORT THAT PLAN AND GOAL NUMBER FIVE, TO OPERATE COLLABORATIVELY WITHIN THE COUNTY AND REGIONALLY, EVEN OUTSIDE THE COUNTY TO DEVELOP COMPREHENSIVE SUSTAINABLE MATERIALS MANAGEMENT STRATEGY. SO COLLECTIVELY, WE CAN DO A LOT MORE, BE A LOT MORE EFFECTIVE. PARALLEL WITH THAT EFFORT, THE COUNTY ALSO UNDERTOOK A STUDY TO LOOK AT WASTE DIVERSION FACILITIES, BUT PARTICULARLY THE DROPOFF FACILITIES AND THE RANGE OF DROPOFF FACILITIES WITHIN THE COUNTY. THIS WAS A KEY PIECE TO HELP TO FEED INTO THAT COUNTY-WIDE PLAN. YOU GAIN AN UNDERSTANDING OF THOSE FACILITIES AND THE NEED FOR THOSE. SO THEY HIRED A LOCAL CONSULTANT TO LOOK AT THAT THOSE FACILITIES. WE SAT IN ON THE TEAM THAT RELATED TO DEVELOP THAT, REVIEW THE PLAN AND A PARTICULAR ITEM OF NOTE TO BRING IT BACK HERE LOCALLY AND LOOKING AT THOSE FACILITIES, THAT STUDY LOOKED AT OUR DROPOFF STATION ON ELLSWORTH ROAD. THE FOLKS KNOW IT VERY WELL. PEOPLE ARE WAITING FOR THAT TO BE REPLACED. THEY CAME TO THE SAME CONCLUSION BUT GAVE SOME GOOD INFORMATION TOO, NOTING THAT THAT FACILITY ALREADY AND HAS FOR SEVERAL YEARS OPERATED AS A LEGAL FACILITY. NEARLY HALF OF THEM ARE CITY RESIDENTS. THE MAJORITY OF CUSTOMERS ARE OUTSIDE THE CITY. SO IT IS A REGIONAL FACILITY AND AT THAT POINT -- AND THIS IS ACTUALLY 2017 DOLLARS, -- PUTS THE REPLACEMENT OF THAT AT $4.8 MILLION FOR A NEW FACILITY, CLOSE BUT DIFFERENT SITE BECAUSE IT'S NOT GOOD TO PUT A FACILITY ON TOP OF AN OLD LANDFILL, AS WE NOW KNOW. SO THE FUNDING FOR THAT, THE PLAN RECOMMENDS WAS TO BE FUNDED THROUGH THE COUNTY AND A CONSORTIUM OF LOCAL UNITS OF GOVERNMENT. SO THOSE REGIONAL PARTNERS, THE FOLKS WITH THOSE CUSTOMERS ARE ALL COME FROM SHOULD PARTICIPATE IN THAT TYPE OF REGIONAL FACILITY. SO WITH THE SOLID WASTE PLAN, SPEAKING TO COLLABORATIVE REGIONAL APPROACHES AND THE STUDY I JUST MENTIONED ALSO LOOKING AT THE COUNTYWIDE DROP OFF AND RECYCLING IF A SATELLITSATELLITITY -- FACILITI. WE LOOKED AT REGIONAL COOPERATION. WHO IS INTERESTED? CAN WE MOVE THIS FORWARD? I WON'T GO THROUGH ALL THE BULLETS FOR THE TIME SAKE BUT AGAIN THE COUNTY ENGAGED R.S. TO LOOK AT REGIONAL AUTHORITY POTENTIAL MORE SPECIFICALLY, SET UP SPECIFIC TIMES DRAWING IN STAKEHOLDERS FOR ORGANIZED AND SPECIFIC CONVERSATIONS AROUND DOES THIS MAKE SENSE? IS THERE INTEREST? IS THERE A POSSIBILITY THAT WE CAN MOVE FORWARD? ARE. AND THROUGH THE INITIAL STAKEHOLDER DISCUSSIONS AND CULMINATING IN JANUARY OF 2018, WITH SOME SPECIFIC STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS AND EVEN INTERVIEWS ON VERY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS AND INFORMATION THAT WAS GARNERED FROM MULTIPLE ST STAKEHOLDERS. 11 MUNICIPALITIES PARTICIPATED. THE WESTERN WASHTENAW AUTHORITY, THE W.W.R.A., THEY PARTICIPATED. SO FROM THAT R.S. DEVELOPED AND PUT TOGETHER THEIR REGIONAL AUTHORITY STUDY AND THE STUDY'S FINDINGS SAID THAT YES, THERE IS ADVANTAGE. THERE IS OPPORTUNITY HERE. THERE IS INTEREST IN REGIONAL COLLABORATION AROUND SOLID WASTE MATERIALS MANAGEMENT AND RECYCLING. AND THEY CITED IN THE -- IN THEIR DOCUMENT TWO KEY FOUNDATIONAL ITEMS THAT REALLY THIS APPROACH CAN BUILD OFF OF. THE SOLID WASTE PLAN THE COUNTY AMENDED BUT ALSO POINTING OUT THE STATUS OF THE CITY'S MATERIAL RECOVERY FACILITY AND AT THAT POINT RMURF IT STOPPED AS A THE PROCESSING FACILITY. COULD THAT FACILITY BE RESTART BUT AROUND THE AREA, COULD THEY FEED INTO THAT TO PROVIDE THE APPROPRIATE MATERIALS. I WON'T READ THROUGH ALL THE BULLETS BUT SEVERAL ADVANTAGES TO THE REGIONAL COOPERATION. BUT BASICALLY STANDARDIZATION TO GET US RECYCLING CONSISTENTLY WHETHER YOU LIVE IN SALINE. AND LOS ANG ALSO THE POTENTIAL T SHARING. THIS STUDY LAID OUT THREE TIERS OF RECOMMENDATIONS. FIRST AT THE INITIAL OR -- AND LOWER LEVEL. EDUCATION AND OUTREACH. HELPINGTHOSE NEIGHBORS AND DOING THAT COMMON OUTREACH IN EDUCATION THAT IS SO IMPORTANT IN ANY RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND RECYCLING PROGRAM. SECOND TIER THEN BEING BACK TO THE DROPOFF FACILITIES PROVIDING EASY AND CONVENIENT ACCESS FOR FOLKS TO DO THEIR RECYCLING. BASICALLY REINFORCING AND RESTATING THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE EARLIER STUDIES BY R.R.S. THE YEAR BEFORE. AND THEN THE NEXT LONGER TIER BUT, AGAIN, BUILDING OFF OF THAT OPPORTUNITY WE HAVE WITH OUR FACILITY, OR SOME OVER LOCATION, BUT WORKING REGIONALLY TO DEVELOP A PERMANENT MATERIALS OR RECOVERY FACILITY FOR THE FOLKS IN THE REGION, WITH A REAL REGIONAL SOLUTION. SO WHAT IS THE NEXT STEP? THERE ARE LOTS OF STEPS. THE COUNTY DEEPS MOVING US FORWARD AND THE CITY STAFF HAS BEEN MOVING ALONG WITH THEM AND KEEPING INFORMED AND PARTICIPATING. SO JUNE 2018, A LITTLE OVER A YEAR AGO, THE COUNTY FORMED AN AUTHORITY FORMATION COMMITTEE. BY NOW LOTS OF COMMUNITIES HAVE COME, AT LEAST LISTENED, WEIGHED IN AND YOU NO WE HAVE GOTTEN DOWN TO EIGHT COMMUNITIES THAT ARE REALLY STILL PRETTY DARN SERIOUS, AND THINKING, YEP, THIS MIGHT MAKE SENSE. THE EIGHT COMMUNITIES LISTED, AND WE HAVE THE CITY OF NOMAR ON ARBOR, AND MOLLY AND CRAIG. AND WE LOOKED AT THIS POTENTIAL AND IT WAS FACILITATED BY THE COUNTY AND WAS BASED AROUND PUBLIC ACT 179 OF THE STATE ACTS, WHICH LAYS OUT REQUIREMENTS AND THE WAY TO ESTABLISH A SOLID WASTE AUTHORITY. SO A QUESTION THAT SOMETIMES HAS COME UP, WHAT ABOUT THE PEOPLE LIKE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, THE ANN ARBOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS. THEY SEEM TO BE SHUT OUT, SOMETHING LIKE THIS. WELL, PUBLIC ACT 179 LAYS OUT THAT SOLID WASTE AUTHORITIES CAN BE CREATED, BUT THE MEMBERS HAVE TO BE MUNICIPALITIES BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THOSE OTHER ENTITIES, THOSE OTHER KEY PARTNERS CAN'T PARTICIPATE. THEY CAN STILL RECEIVE SERVICES AND BE PART OF DISCUSSIONS BUT THEY CAN'T HAVE A VOTING SEAT ON THE BOARD. THAT'S WHERE THE LINE IS DRAWN. SO THE COMMITTEE AND THOSE REASONNIVES FROM THOSE EIGHT COMMUNITIES MET OVER THOSE MONTHS AND THE ITEMS DISCUSSED AND REALLY SEEN AS THE POTENTIAL, THE INITIAL EFFORTS, WHAT DOES THIS WRRMA -- WHAT IS THIS WRRMA ABOUT? WHAT IS IT GOING TO DO? AND IT'S GOT TO GET OFF THE GROUND. SO THERE'S SOME INITIAL STEPS, INITIAL AREAS OF FOCUS. AGAIN, I KEEP COMING BACK TO EDUCATION AND OUTREACH AND INFORMING PEOPLE, WHAT IS THE RIGHT WAY TO RECYCLE. HOW DO WE DEAL WITH OUR MATERIALS IN THE BEST MANNER AND HOW DO WE DO THAT WITH WHAT WE NEED AND DOING THAT IN A CONSISTENT MANNER AND DO WE IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF OUR RECYCLABLES. AND THEN ALSO DATA METRICS. TRACKING AMONG THE MEMBERS WHOEVER ENDS UP PARTICIPATING IN THIS AUTHORITY, HOW ARE THEY RECYCLING, WHAT ARE THEY RECYCLING AND TRACKING IT IN A CONSISTENT MANNER, COLLABORATIVELY AND COOPERATIVELY, SO WE CAN UNDERSTAND THOSE MEMBER COMMUNITIES, HOW ARE THEY DOING INDIVIDUALLY BUT ALSO COLLECTIVELY, REALLY WITH THE GOAL BEING WORKING COLLECTIVELY TO BECOME ATTRACTIVE. COMMUNITIES FOR A PROCESSOR, A RECYCLER, THAT WOULD WANT TO COME IN, THAT WOULD WANT TO -- BE DESIRING TO COME IN TO WRRMA, WHOEVER WRRMA IS, AND INVEST IN THEM, A MURF FACILITY FOR THAT REGION. AND THEN LAST FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES. THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT SEND OUT THEIR RECYCLE. COLLABORATIVE CONTRACTING FOR THOSE WHO DO THE CONTRACTED COLLECTIONS, BUT, DEPEND THAT COULD BE SOMETHING THAT MEMBERS COULD CHOOSE TO OPT IN OR NOT. AND SO THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT -- THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS SPOKE TO. SO AS TO THE STATUS OF WRRMA, WHERE DO WE STAND TODAY? THAT COMMITTEE LAST MET THIS NOVEMBER, ENDED BY PUTTING TOGETHER ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION. THE DOCUMENT THAT WOULD LAY OUT AND ESTABLISH WRRMA AS AN ENTITY. THOSE ARTICLES WERE PRESENTED TO THE BOARDS AB COUNCILS THIS YEAR, JANUARY TO APRIL TIME FRAME, AS I RECALL. IT WAS PRESENTED IN MARCH, TO THIS BODY HERE. SEVEN OF EIGHT MUNICIPALITIES DID VOTE TO ADOPT THE ARTICLES AND SAY THAT THEY WANTED TO JOIN WAWRRMA. AS YOU KNOW, WE DECIDED TO WAIT UNTIL THE SOLID WASTE PLAN WAS DONE AND COMING BACK WITH THE INFORMATION. SO THE OTHER SEVEN LISTED THERE HAVE VOTED TO JOIN WRRMA AND ADOPT THE ARTICLES. IN JULY, THOSE REPRESENTATIVES DID HAVE A MEETING, THE COUNTY ORGANIZED THEM AND BROUGHT THEM TOGETHER AND THEY INVITED THE CITY. THEY ACTUALLY -- I ATTENDED AS A STAFF PERSON TO UPDATE THAT GROUP OF WHERE DOES THE CITY STAND? WELL, WHAT'S HAPPENED AS FAR AS WRRMA AND THAT RELATION WITH THE SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT PLAN, IT WAS CLEAR TO LET THEM KNOW THAT COUNCIL, YOU FOLKS DID NOT SAY NO. YOU DID NOT PUSH AWAY AND VOTE IT DOWN BUT YOU WANTED TO WAIT UNTIL OUR PLAN WAS DOB DONE ANDI PROVIDED UPDATE FOR THE TIMING OF THAT AND ACTUALLY SAID, PROBABLY BE ABOUT THE SEPTEMBER TIME FRAME THAT TH THINGS WOULDE WRAPPED UP. WE ARE CERTAINLY WELCOME WITH THE CITY TO PARTICIPATE, BUT YET AT THE SAME TIME, THEY HAVE MADE A DECISION TO GO FORWARD AND COLLECTIVELY RUN THE TABLE. THEY DECIDED THAT THEY DID, INDEED, WANT TO MOVE FORWARD AND ASKED THE COUNTY TO TAKE THE STEPS TO OFFICIALLY ESTABLISH THE AUTHORITY. THERE'S PAPERS THAT HAVE TO BE FILED AND NOTICES PUBLISHED. SO THAT IS UNDERWAY AND MAY EVEN BE DONE. I HAVEN'T CHECKED IN WITH THE COUNTY RECENTLY. BUT THEIR FIRST OFFICIAL BOARD MEETING FOR THE AUTHORITY IS SCHEDULED FOR SEPTEMBER 23rd. SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT WILL BE IN PLACE AND THAT WOULD BE WE THE OFFICIAL FIRST MEETING OF THE BOARD. THEY ARE AN ESTABLISHED ENTITY. THAT DOESN'T SHUT US OUT. IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE CITY OR THE COUNTY CAN'T JOIN RIGHT AFTER, OR ANY TIME IN THE FUTURE, IT CHANGES THE PROCESS. NOW AS AN ESTABLISHED AUTHORITY, THE CITY COULD REQUEST THE BOARD, WHERE WRRMA FOR THE CITY TO JOIN. AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS THEY WOULD HAVE TO AGREE TO AMEND THEIR ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION, THEIR DOCUMENT, BECAUSE THAT ITS LIST OF MEMBERS OF THE AUTHORITY. AND SO TO ADD A COMMUNITY MEANS TO AMEND THE DOCUMENT. SO WE WOULD HAVE TO ASK FOR THAT AMENDMENT. THE BOARD WOULD HAVE TO APPROVE IT AND THEN AN ADDED STEP, ALL THE EXISTING COMMUNITY MEMBERS, THEIR BOARDS OR COUNCILS WOULD ALSO HAVE TO APPROVE THAT AMENDED SET OF ARTICLES. SO YOU FOLKS CAN STILL DECIDE THAT'S SOMETHING WE WANT TO DO AND THAT CAN BE TAKEN TO THE BOARD AND THE STEPS PUT IN MACE PLACETO HAVE THOSE ARTICLES AME. AND JUST TO WRAP UP THAT STAFF, AS NOTED IN THE MARCH ITEM TO THE COUNCIL THAT THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION HAS SUPPORTED JOINING WRRMA FOR THOSE ITEMS THAT I TOUCHED ON THROUGH THE PRESENTATION. AND SO WITH THAT, I APOLOGIZE FOR A BIT OF THE SPEED TO THAT. I WILL OPEN IT UP FOR DISCUSSIONS AND QUESTIONS ASH QD WRRMA, IN PARTICULAR.
00:54:21.584: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
00:54:22.418: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. THANK YOU, MR. SLOTTEN. JUST IN TERMS OF -- I DO HAVE -- I HAVE A QUESTION ON WRRMA FOR YOU. I WOULD JUST SAY IN GENERAL -- I GUESS YOU WANT OUR FEEDBACK TOO. IT'S BEEN MY EXPERIENCE THAT WHEN FOLKS TALK REGIONAL ANYTHING, THAT THERE'S ECONOMY TFOR SCALE THAT IT REDUCES THE COST. I WOULD ANTICIPATE FOR THE SMALLER TOWNS THAT THERE'S INCREASED DIVERSION OPPORTUNITIES, BUT FOR THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR, WHO IS OBVIOUSLY THE DOMINANT PLAYER BY ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE IN THE AUTHORITY, IT'S NOT AT ALL CLEAR WHAT THE FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS WOULD BE PARTICIPATING IN ANY OF THE CONTEMPLATED REGIONAL EFFORTS. AS WE ALL KNOW THE COST BENEFIT FORTHE CITY WILL BE WHOLLY DEPENDENT ON THE SPECIFIC COST SHARING AGREEMENTS THAT THE AUTHORITY DEVELOPS. AND AT THIS POINT, NONE OF THOSE EXIST. AND THERE'S NO INFORMATION THAT'S BEEN PROVIDED ON THE COST IMPLICATIONS FOR THE CITY. THE SOLID WASTE REGIONAL MANAGEMENT PLAN CONTAINS A WEALTH OF INFORMATION, AND COST DATA AND REALLY IF DATA AND ANALYSIS THAT IS CERTAINLY HELPFUL IN DECISION MAKING BUT THE STUDY THAT WE ARE REVIEWING TONIGHT, APPROPRIATELY, I THINK, DOES NOT VENTURE A GUESS AS TO THE FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS FOR THE CITY JOINING THE AUTHORITY. SO WHERE I'M COMING FROM, AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE, WE CONSIDER JOINING AN AUTHORITY, BUT NOT NOW IN MY OPINION. I'M ONLY -- THE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE, I THINK IS VERY PROBLEMATIC, WEARING THE CITY'S HAT AND FOR ME ONLY IF THERE WERE A CHANGE IN THE BASIC GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE OF THE AUTHORITY WHERE THE VOTING POWER IS VOLUME WEIGHTED, NOT -- NOT ONE MEMBER, ONE VOTE. I WOULDN'T SUPPORT THE CITY JOINING ANY AUTHORITY OR COOPERATIVE, WHERE WE WERE THE DOMINANT PLAYER, BUT WE DIDN'T HAVE THE CORRESPONDING VOTING POWER AND AUTHORITY. AND THAT'S WHAT WRRMA IS. YOU KNOW, TO BE HONEST, I'M NOT REAL CONFIDENT THAT THE CITY WOULD BE TREATED EQUITABLY. THE COUNTY'S TRACK RECORD IN THIS REGARD BASED ON THE RECENT PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY MILLAGE DEMONSTRATES THAT THE COUNTY HAS NO QUALMS ABOUT STICKING IT TO THE CITY FINANCIALLY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE COUNTY. IN THE CASE OF MILLAGE, BY DISTRIBUTING THE MIMINGAGE REBATE PROCEEDS BASED ON MILLAGE, NOTE THE TAXES PAID. THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR SUBSIDIZED THE OTHERS TO A QUARTER OF A MILLION DOLLARS. THE COUNTY COMMISSIONERS KNEW THAT AND CONSCIOUSLY STRUCTURED IT THAT WAY. SO I DON'T THINK THAT BODES WELL FOR AN EQUAL PLAYING FIELD FOR THE CITY. SO I HAVE A LOT OF RESERVATIONS AND THE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE, YOU KNOW, FOR ME IS A RED FLAG. AND THEN JUST LASTLY IN TERMS THE REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION, RATHER THAN AN AUTHORITY, I WOULD LIKE TO SEE US FOCUS ON THE DROPOFF STATION. I WAS SURPRISED TO SEE THAT JUST HALF THE USERS WERE NASH ANN ARR RRESIDENTS AND 53% ARE NOT. LATER IF YOU COULD COME BACK WITH THIS INFORMATION, YOU DID SHOW THE PROJECTION FOR THE COSTS THAT -- THE REPLACEMENT COSTS AS 4.8 MILLION. SO IF YOU COULD PROVIDE US, I THINK THIS WOULD BE HELPFUL, THE MAJOR ASSUMPTIONS, SIZE, LOCATION, FUNCTIONALITY, WHO PAYS, ET CETERA. I KNOW YOU SAID THIS WOULD BE FUNDED REGIONALLY. BUT THAT WERE USED IN DEVELOPING -- THE ASSUMPTIONS MADE IN THE GO T GETTING TO THAT $4.5 MILLION ASSUMPTION. THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL.
00:58:52.488: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER QUESTIONS?
00:58:53.389: >> Councilmember Bannister: THANK YOU, CRESS. THERE WAS ONE OTHER THING ABOUT THE BYLAWS THEY DON'T PROVIDE EQUITABLE TERMS OF GOVERNANCE. DO YOU KNOW THAT IT'S, YOU KNOW, HERE IN ANN ARBOR, WE LIKE TO MAINTAIN OUR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING RIGHTS OF EMPLOYEES FOR PROVIDING THE SOLID WASTE SERVICES AND THE WRRMA DOES NOT STATE THATN THEIR ARTICLES AND BYLAWS. IT HASN'T BEEN UPDATED FOR THAT YET. WAS THERE ANY DISCUSSION EVER THAT AT YOUR JULY 11 MEETING?
00:59:35.230: >> City Admin. Lazarus: IF I COULD JUMP IN A LITTLE BIT. I THINK WE ALL HEARD AND UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN ABOUT THE CITY BEING THE LARGEST POPULATION CENTER IN THE COUNTY. THE -- IF THE CITY WERE TO JOIN US, IT'S NOT OBLIGATED TO ENTER INTO ANY AGREEMENT AT ALL, IF THE TERMS ARE NOT CONSISTENT WITH PROVIDING US WITH BEST VALUE OR WITH ANY OTHER VALUES THAT WE MAY HAVE. THAT WOULD INCLUDE PROVIDING THAT CONTRACTS PROVIDE FOR A LIVING WAGE. I THINK IT'S PROBLEMATIC, THOUGH, THAT WE CAN'T PRESCRIBE UNION MEMBERSHIPS IN THOSE AGREEMENTS. I THINK THAT'S VIOLATION OF STATE STATUTE, BUT, AGAIN, IF WE ARE TO THE COMFORTABLE WITH A CONTRACT, THAT WOULD COME BEFORE THE REGIONAL AUTHORITY, WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO JOIN IT. SO THEREFORE, IF THE CITY DOESN'T JOIN IT, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE VALUE IS LOST BECAUSE YOU DON'T GET THE ECONOMIES OF SCALE. SO THERE IS AN INDIRECT REPRESENTATION FOR HOW WE WOULD PARTICIPATE, BASED ON THOSE THINGS THAT WOULD BE -- THE CONTRACTS THAT WOULD BE SOUGHT. SO THAT'S JUST SOMETHING FOR COUNCIL TO CONSIDER.
01:00:51.206: >> MLMEMBER BANNISTER, YOU STILL HAVE THE FLOOR.
01:00:54.543: >> Councilmember Bannister: I'M ALL SET.
01:01:02.417: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
01:01:03.919: >> Councilmember Eaton: I WANT TO REITERATE THAT BEFORE WE JOIN THIS AUTHORITY, WE SHOULD ASK FOR THE CHANGES IN THE ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION THAT WE EXPECT. IT'S NOT A WORKABLE FORM UNLESS WE JOIN, BUT IF WE JOIN BEFORE WE ARE GIVEN PROPER REPRESENTATION, IN THAT BODY, OUR ONLY RESORT IS TO LEAVE THE ORGANIZATION IF WE DON'T GET OUR WAY. I BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD ASSERT THAT BEFORE WE JOIN. THAT WE ASK THAT WE HAVE A PROPORTIONATE VOTE ON THAT BOARD, AND OFFER LABOR PROTECTIONS, NOT NECESSARILY THE RIGHT TO UNIONIZE, BUT CERTAINLY A GUARANTEE THAT NO CURRENT EMPLOYEE OF ANY MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE SERVICE BE DISADVANTAGED BY WAGES AND OUR PARTICIPATION IN THIS. IF WE DON'T ESTABLISH THAT BEFORE WE JOIN, WE HAVE THE SAME VOTE AS EVERY ONE OF THE TOWNSHIPS AND VILLAGES THAT ALREADY BELONG. SO I JUST WANT THAT TO BE THE WARNING THAT I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS FORM OF GOVERNANCE WITH THIS DESPERATE WEIGHTING OF AUTHORITY.
01:02:30.138: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION ON THIS POINT? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
01:02:33.642: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. I JUST WANT TO CONQUER WITH MY COLLEAGUES ON THAT. JUST LISTENING HERE, WEIGHING IN, BOTH OPTIONS AND ALL SIDES TO THE ARGUMENT. I STILL FEEL LIKE WE GIVE UP A LOT OF CERTAINTY FOR A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY, AND IN ORDER TO DO THAT, IT NEEDS TO BE DEFINED IN A BETTER WAY FOR US TO GIVE AWAY THAT TYPE OF CERTAINTY. AND WHAT COUNCILMEMBER LUMM HAD TO SAY ABOUT THE MENTAL HEALTH REBATE MILLAGE, YOU KNOW, THAT'S OUR LAST EXAMPLE. SO I DON'T FEEL THAT THIS IS BEING SOLD IN THAT SAME VEIN, BUT YOU HAVE GOT TO UNDERSTAND THAT IN A LOT OF WAYS WE ARE DONORS TO THE -- TO THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES AND, YOU KNOW, THE HEAVY -- THE LOAD IS GETTING HEAVY. SO LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING MORE.
01:03:34.202: >> Mayor Taylor: FOR MY PART, I WOULD SUPPORT JOINING THE AUTHORITY AS IS. I VIEW IT AS GETTING A SEAT AT THE TABLE. YOU KNOW, THE -- THERE ARE PLENTY OF OFF RAMPS WITH RESPECT TO COMMITMENTS FOR THE CITY. WE ARE NOT COMMITTING OURSELVES TO ANYTHING, EXCEPT TO PARTICIPATION IN AN ORGANIZATION THAT WILL PLAN REGIONALLY. THIS IS THE PLACE WHERE WE ARE GOING TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS OR WE WOULD HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR REGIONAL PARTNERS. THE FACT THAT WE HAVE ONE VOTE AT THIS LOCATION -- PART ME, THE FACT THAT WE WOULD HAVE ONE VOTE ON THIS BOARD IS IMMATERIAL, BECAUSE WE WOULD HAVE THE ONLY VOTE WITH RESPECT TO WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE GOING TO SIGN ON TO THE CONTRACT DEVISED BY THIS GROUP. THAT IS A VETO, A -- YOU KNOW, A VETO THAT CANNOT BE OVERRIDDEN WITH RESPECT TO WHETHER OR NOT WE ARE GOING TO PARTICIPATE IN WHATEVER PLAN THE ORGANIZATION WOULD DEVELOP, WHATEVER, YOU KNOW, WE WOULD NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S RIGHT FOR ANN ARBOR AND A VALUE TO ANN ARBOR. IN MY VIEW, IT IS -- YOU KNOW, IT IS WITHOUT RISK AND IT IS THE ONLY OPPORTUNITY, THE ONLY LOCATION FOR US ALL TO HAVE REASONABLE, RECENT CONVERSATIONS WITH COLLEAGUES. I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN WITH RESPECT TO A LACK OF CERTAINTY AT THIS POINT BUT I DON'T VIEW THAT AS A BAR. THE CONTRACT IS THE POINT WHERE WE HAVE CLARITY. THIS IS JUST A GROUP THAT WILL ARRIVE AT THAT TO GO. IN MY VIEW, IT WOULD BE REGRETTABLE AND NOT THINKING IN THE LONG TERM FOR US TO DECLINE TO PARTICIPATE. FURTHER DISCUSSION AND THEN PERHAPS MOVE ON TO THE BALANCE OF THE -- TO THE BALANCE OF THE PRESENTATION. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
01:05:25.514: >> Councilmember Lumm: JUST, YOU KNOW, FOR SINGING THE PRAISES OF REGIONALISM AND I SEE THAT U OF M WAS INCLUDED AS A STAKEHOLDER. THAT MAKES SENSE BUT THEY CAN'T PARTICIPATE. THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. I KNOW THERE'S A STATE LAW THAT -- SO THEY ARE NOT DEFINED AS A MUNICIPAL FORM OF GOVERNMENT, BUT, YOU KNOW, FOR US IN ANN ARBOR, IT MAKES A LOT MORE SENSE AND FOR THE UNIVERSITY TO COLLABORATE AND COOPERATE MUCH MORE SO THAN FOR ANN ARBOR TO, YOU KNOW, HITCH ITS WAGON TO DEXTER OR TO SALINE. IT JUST INTUITIVELY -- AGAIN, IF YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT, YOU KNOW, HAVE A COMMISSION OF ECONOMIES OF SCALE AND REDUCED COSTS THAT SEEMS TO BE THE MUCH MORE LOGICAL PATH. SO I APPRECIATE WHAT COUNCILMEMBERS HAVE SAID. COUNCICOUNCILMCOUNCILMEMBER RAMS HAVE INT POINTED OUT, THERE'S SO MANY UNCERTAINTIES. THAT WORLD OF UNCERTAINTY IS QUITE A BIG ONE. THANK YOU.
01:06:34.950: >> Mayor Taylor: HOW MUCH DOES IT COST TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS?
01:06:38.820: >> $5,000.
01:06:39.121: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
01:06:40.622: >> Councilmember Lumm: THAT'S NOT THE COST I'M TALKING ABOUT.
01:06:47.062: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION?
01:06:55.837: >> SO THE SOLID WASTE RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PLAN. SWRMP I AM GO INTO THE PROCESS THAT WE USED TO DEVELOP THE PLAN AND THEN WE WILL TURN THINGS OVER TO MOLLY FOR THE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION. SO IN TERMS OF THE SWRMP, TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW. IT IS --Y APOLOGIES.
01:07:23.765: >> Councilmember Lumm: IT IS WHAT IT IS.
01:07:25.000: >> THIS IS A ROADMAP FOR OUR RESOURCE MANAGEMENT SERVICES FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS AND BEYOND. LOOK AT OUR CURRENT PROGRAMS, WHERE SHOULD THOUGH THOSE PROPROGRAMS -- WHERE SHOULD THOE PROGRAMS GO IN T IN THE FUTURE. WHAT DOES IT COST TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES WE ALREADY PROVIDE TO HELP US FIGURE OUT WHAT IS IT TO GO TAKE TO EXPAND AND IMPROVE THOSE? LOOKING AT PEER COMMUNITIES, ROBUST PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT, EMPHASIZE THE WORD ROBUST AND NOW GET INTO THE DETAIL AND I WILL JUST PAUSE THAT. IN MY 32 AND A HALF YEARS -- I STARTED HERE WHEN I WAS 12 -- 32 AND A HALF YEARS WITH THE CITY, THIS WAS PROBABLY THE MOST ROBUST ENGAGEMENT EFFORT, BREADTH AND DEPTH AND TYPE THAT I HAVE BEEN A PART OF. THERE MAY HAVE BEEN MORE WITH THE CITY, BUT VERY EXTENSIVE. AND THEN ALSO LOOKING FOR OPTIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS. SO I WILL PAUSE FOR A SECOND FOR A GRAPHIC THAT CAME OUT OF THE PRESENTATION EARLIER IN THE PROJECT TO ILLUSTRATE OUR CURRENT SYSTEM TO PROVIDE CONTEXT FOR FOLKS HERE AT COUNCIL AND ALSO AUDIENCE SITTING AT HOME. DEPENDING ON THE MATERIAL THAT GOES IN YOUR CONTAINER, WHETHER IT'S WASTE, CRASH, RECYCLE, OR COMPOST ORGANICS BUT ALSO DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU LIVE OR WHERE YOU WORK, WHAT TYPE OF UNIT OR PROPERTY YOU ARE IN, IT CAN BE ONE OF THREE PARTIES THAT PICKS UP THAT MATERIAL. IT COULD BE THE CITY. IT COULD BE RECYCLE ANN ARBOR, AND IT COULD BE WASTE MANAGEMENT UNDER OUR SPECIAL WASTE FRANCHISE. THOSE MATERIALS ARE COLLECTED. SO WE HAVE GOT THREE ENTITIES DRIVING TRUCKS AROUND TOWN. THOSE MATERIALS ARE THEN TAKEN TO THREE POST-COLLECTION FACILITIES THAT THE CITY HAS AND HAS OPERATORS THAT -- CONTRACT OPERATORS THAT OPERATE THOSE FOR US. THE TRASH IS TAKEN TO OUR WASTE TRANSFER STATION OR ADVANCED DISPOSAL AND TAKES THAT MATERIAL AND TAKES IT TO A LANDFILL THAT THEY OPERATE. THE RECYCLING MATERIALS GOES TO OUR MURF. IT'S A LIMITED MAPPUAL PROCESSING AND RECYCLE ANN ARBOR SENDS THAT DOWN TO RUNKE IN CINCINNATI AND THE COMPOST AND ORGANICS IT GOES TO OUR FACILITY WHERE OUR CONTRACTOR TURNS THAT INTO A MARKETABLE. SO LOTS OF MOVING PARTS. A VERY COMPLEX SYSTEM. SO THAT'S WHAT I WAS GIVEN TO TRY TO IMPROVE. SO FOR THIS PLAN, THE GOALS AND HOWARD DID A GOOD LEAD-IN TO SET THE STAGE, BUT TENDING HERE TO LITERALLY PULL OUT AND CLARIFY, WHAT WERE WE STRIVING FOR? SO THE TOP BULLET, THE OBJECTIVE FROM THE PLAN, PULLED FROM THE RFP AND THE CONTRACT SCOPE THAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR A STRATEGIC APPROACH TO PROVIDE EFFECTIVE SOLID WASTE AREA SERVICES AND PROGRAMS. THAT MEETS THE NEEDS THE COMMUNITIES AND THE DESIRES THE COMMUNITY. WHAT DOES THE COMMUNITY WANT? BUT CRITICALLY AND KEY IN A FINANCIALLY STABLE MANNER. IT'S BEEN A CONCERN AND THAT -- OF THE COMMUNITY AND THE ORGANIZATION. AND, AGAIN, I WON'T GO ON TOO LONG BECAUSE HOWARD HIT IT WELL. WE HAVE GOALS, VISIONARY GOALS THAT ARE ESTABLISHED. THIS IS SETTING OUT THE STRATEGIC DIRECTION, LAYING OUT THE STEPS TO MOVE US FORWARD TO ADVANCE THOSE GOALS BUT NOT TO REVISIT THEM. THEY ARE STILL THERE AND THEY ARE STILL VALID. SO THE TOPIC AREAS, I WILL TRY TO KIND OF GUIDE YOU AS THE SORTS OF THINGS THAT WERE LOOKED AT. SO TOWARDS THOSE VISIONARY GOALS, WHERE ARE SOME OPPORTUNITIES EVEN LOOKING AT A PROGRAMMATIC LEVEL FOR INCREASING DIVERSIONS. SO FOR MOVING THE NEEDLE FORWARD? SO WE HAVE HEARD FOR A LONG TIME AND, AGAIN, ORGANICS EXPANSION, MULTIFAMILY RECYCLING BUT EVEN LOOKING AT SOME UNIQUE SPECIALTY PROGRAMS, SUCH AS TEXTILES, A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN WE HAVE DONE. FUNCTIONAL AND OPERATIONAL ELEMENTS. YOU FOLKS, I HAVE HEARD STAFF HAS HEARD ABOUT THE DOWNTOWN AND THE ALLEYS AND THE SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED AND THE CONCERNS WITH THAT. FATS, OILS AND GREASE AS HOWARD MENTION IS IN OUR GOALS TO MOVE THAT FORWARD. AND THEN SERVICE DELIVERY, LOOKING AT HOW DO WE PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES, THAT COMPLEX MYRIAD MATRIX THAT WE, HAVE HOW CAN WE IMPROVE ON THAT AND ADMINISTER THE PROGRAM IN A MORE EFFECTIVE MANNER AND WHAT ARE THE COS COSTS TO DO SO AND ALSOY ARE COULD N COGNIZANT OF THE REGIONAL. SO WHAT WAS PRODUCED? WHAT'S AT OUTCOME OF THIS? WE HAVE A FINANCIAL MODEL NOW. AGAIN, A LOT OF CONCERNS, QUESTIONS ON THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF THE SOLID WASTE FUND AND THE SOLID WASTE SYSTEM. SO WE NOW HAVE MODEL BASED ON FY '18 ACTUALS AND SO THAT FISCAL YEAR WAS DONE AND AUDITED AND SO OUR FINANCIAL COST OF SERVICE ANALYSIS, IS BASED ON THOSE ACTUAL ITEMS. AND SO THOSE ACTUALS ARE THEN USED TO LOOK FORWARD AND HELP DEVELOP OPTIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS. AND TO HEAD TOWARDS RECOMMENDATIONS, THE PLAN INCLUDES 24 TOTAL RECOMMENDATIONS. 21 IN THE ACTUAL SERVICE AREAS, SERVICE PROGRAMS, EITHER EXPANSION OR IMPROVEMENT, AND FIVE FOCUS AREAS AND I WILL LET MOLLY GET INTO THAT IN MORE DETAIL AND THREE RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED TO FUNDING. SO THE PROCESS AND I WILL TAKE IT A CHUNK AT A TIME. THE PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT, AS I SAID, ROBUST COMPREHENSIVE. WE BEGAN A YEAR AGO SUMMER. JULY THROUGH SEPTEMBER OF 2018. 33 SEPARATE STAKEHOLDER INTERVIEWS. WIDE RANGE OF PARTIES, PERSPECTIVES INVOLVED AND AFFECTED BY OUR SOLID WASTE PROGRAMS. STAFF, CONTRACTORS, BUSINESS FOLKS, COMMISSIONERS, ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSIONERS, DOWNTOWN BUSINESSES, OUR CONTRACTORS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS. WITH THE CONCERN AROUND DOWNTOWN WE HAVE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE DOWNTOWN, AGAIN MERCHANT ASSOCIATIONS, BUSINESSES, PROPERTY OWNERS. THIS PROJECT INCLUDED A SCIENTIFICALLY VALID SURVEY. IT FELT VERY KEY ELEMENT TO TRULY GET A VALID PULSE OF REACTION OF THE COMMUNITY THAT WE CAN BE CONFIDENT IN ITS RESULTS. AND THE PROJECT HAD APRIL ADVISORY COMMITTEE THAT MET BEGINNING IN NOVEMBER OF 2018 AND WRAPPED UP WITH A FIFTH MEETING OF FOLKS -- REMEMBER, YOU APPROVED A CHANGE ORDER TO ADD A FIFTH MEETING. AGAIN, MY LUCK ON THIS PROJECT, THE LARGEST ADVISORY COMMITTEE I HAD, 60 PLUS PARTICIPANT THAT WE HAD MORE THAN 60 PEOPLE THAT ATTENDED AT LEAST ONE AND MOST OF THEM ATTENDED MULTIPLE MEETINGS. I HAD PEOPLE ASK ME HOW OUR PUBLIC MEETING WENT. I SAID NO, IT'S AN ADVISORY MEETING, NOT A PUBLIC MEETING. WE HAD GENERAL RESIDENTS INVOLVED AS WELL. SO TO STEP BACK AND IN TERMS OF PROCESS AND I APOLOGIZE, I CAN'T READ THIS. YOU CAN ZOOM IN AFTER ON THE PDF, BUT THIS WAS AN OUTCOME OF THOSE STAKEHOLDER INTERVIEWS. IF FOLKS HAVE GONE THROUGH A PLANNING PROCESS, YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF A S.W.A.T. ANALYSIS WHERE AROUND A TOPIC OR ISSUE OR AN ITEM, YOU ARE LOOKING AT WHAT ARE THE STRENGTHS AROUND THIS ITEM? WHAT ARE ITS WEAKNESSES? WHERE ARE THEIR OPPORTUNITIES? WHERE ARE THINGS THAT WE COULD LOOK TO MOVE FORWARD OR GO AND THEN RATHER THAN THREATS, WHICH IS WHAT USUALLY THE T IS WE USE THE WORD NEEDS, WE SAW THEM AS NEEDS NOT THREATS. AND SO THIS CAKE CAME FROM THE STAKEHOLDER DISCUSSIONS AND INTERVIEWS AND THAT'S WHAT WAS BUILT UPON MOVING FORWARD AND THE FOCUS GROUP AS WELL INTO THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE, THE RECOMMENDATIONS, THE BENCHMARKING, WHICH SHE WILL GET TO AND THE CITIZEN SURVEY. SO TO SPEAK OF THE CITIZEN SURVEY, I MENTIONED THIS WAS A SCIENTIFICALLY VALID SURVEY, NOT TO GET TOO INTO THE WEEDS, BUT I THINK IT'S POS IMPORTANT WE DIDA PHONE SURVEY. THIS WAS A SUBCONSULTANT. A SURVEY ON THE TEAM THAT THEY MADE THOUSANDS OF PHONE CALLS TO LITERALLY 400 RESPONDENTS IN THE COMMUNITY, VALIDATED, BALANCED BETWEEN HOMEOWNERS AND RENTERS. THAT WAS A KEY PART THAT OUR COMMUNITY IS THAT OUR COMMUNITY IS MADE UP OF RENTERS. THAT WAS PART OF THE MAKEUP. BECAUSE THE RIGOR GIVEN TO THE QUESTIONS, THERE IS -- NOT TO GET TOO WONKY ON IT, BUT 95% CONFIDENCE LEVEL AT A MARGIN OF ERROR. 4.9%. THE WAY I DESCRIBE, IT THE WAY IT WAS EXPLAINED TO ME, IF WE HAVE A QUESTION AND THE RESPONSE -- 75% OF THE RESPONDENTS SAID YES, WE HAVE A 95% CONFIDENCE LEVEL THAT WITHIN 4.9%, CALL IT 5%, THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE WOULD SAY YES. SO IF MY EXAMPLE WAS 75%, WE'RE 95% CONFIDENT THAT THE COMMUNITY WOULD BE 70 TO 80 WOULD BE THAT RANGE. THAT'S WHAT THAT MEANS. AND AS LISTED HERE ARE THE BROAD RANGE OF TOPICS THAT WERE BUILT INTO THE QUESTIONS TO TRY TO GET FEEDBACK FROM THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE. SO TO GET INTO SOME OF WHAT WE HEARD, IN TERMS OF SATISFACTION, FROM THOSE RESIDENTS OF PEOPLE ACTUALLY GETTING THE SERVICE AT THEIR HOMES, LITERALLY, WHETHER IT'S A HOMEOWNER OR A RENTAL, THE COLLECTION SERVICES, WHETHER IT'S GARBAGE COLLECTIONS BY THE CITY, RECYCLING COLLECTION SERVICES, RECYCLING ANN ARBOR, THIS' A HIGH LEVEL OF SATISFACTION. 96%. COMPOST YOU SEE LESSER BUT A KEY POINT HERE AND A TAKEAWAY AS I MENTIONED RENTERS WERE A KEY PART IN 50% AND RENTERS ESPECIALLY APARTMENT COMPLEXES, THEY DON'T PARTICIPATE AND DON'T EVEN NECESSARILY KNOW ABOUT THE COMPEOPLE PROGRAM AND SO THE D.K. MEANS DON'T KNOW OR REF, REFUSED. SO THAT'S WHERE OPEN THE COMPOST COLLECTION 23%S DIDN'T KNOW OR DIDN'T HAVE A RESPONSE. ANOTHER ITEM THAT THE SURVEY TOLD US IS THAT RESIDENTS DO WANT ADDITIONAL SERVICES. OUR TWO HIGHEST RESPONDENTS, THEY ARE ALL LISTED THERE BUT THE TWO I WILL HIGHLIGHT THERE ON THE LEFT, 27%, FOCUSESES ARE LOOKING FOR BULK WASTE COLLECTION AS PART OF THE CITY PROGRAMS, AS WELL AS, AGAIN, STILL HEARING THE YEAR ROUND COMPOST QUESTION. IT'S STILL OUT THERE. WE KNOW. WE ARE TRYING TO GET THERE AS YOU WILL SEE. AND THEN TO THE RIGHT THERE, THAT GRAPH IS REPRESENTING, WE ASK QUESTIONS, WOULD THERE BE A WILLINGNESS TO PAY A LITTLE MORE TO GET THOSE ADDED SERVICES? AND THE RANGES THERE ON THAT BOX GRAPH, THOSE WERE PRESENTED. SO, FOR EXAMPLE, WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO PAY $1 TO $3 MORE TO GET ADDED SERVICES? 89% OF THE PEOPLE SAID, YES, I WILL PAY $1 TO $3 AND THEN INCLINING UP, ALL THE WAY TO $8 TO $10 PER MONTH MORE. YOU ARE GETTING PRETTY CLOSE TO 50/50 BUT IT'S STILL SLIGHTLY OVER HALF, PEOPLE ARE SAYING I WOULD RATHER PAY $8 TO $10 MORE FOR THE ADDED SERVICES I'M LOOKING AT. QUESTIONS WERE ASKED HOW FOLKS WANT TO PAY FOR THEIR SERVICES. AS I BELIEVE YOU ARE AWARE, WE HAVE A SOLID WASTE MILLAGE. SO WE RECOVER REVENUE THROUGH PROPERTY TAXES. OTHER COMMUNITIES HAVE FLAT FEES. YOU WILL HEAR THE TERM PAY AS YOU THROW, WHICH THERE'S VARIATIONS TO THAT BAG, STICKERS, DIFFERENT WAYS THAT THERE'S A FLAT FEE. YOU  PAY ONE PRICE FOR A STICKER TO GET A BAG OF TRASH. BUT WHAT WE HEARD FROM THE RESIDENTS WAS VERY STRONGLY THAT THEY ARE HAPPY THAT -- ACTUALLY, THEY PREFER A PROPERTY AND MILLAGE PACE. WE SAW THAT AS THE COMMUNITIES VALUES ON EQUITY, THAT THEY DON'T WANT THAT FLAT FEE. THAT IF FOLKS ARE MORE ABLE THROUGH THEIR PROPERTY TAXES TO FUND MORE, THEY ARE OKAY WITH, AND, IN FACT, THEY PREFER THAT AT 68% WITH HAVING IT THAT WAY, VERSUS ONLY 27% BEING OPPOSED TO THAT. AND THEN THE FLIP SIDE OF THAT, WOULD YOU WANT A FIXED MONTHLY BILL, 55% SAID NO, ACTUALLY I DON'T WANT IT THAT WAY. SO THAT EQUITY POINT CAME IN. AND THEN OVER ON THE RIGHT, ITEM IN TERMS OF SCALING OF THE FEES, AGAIN, SOME COMMUNITIES, IF YOU GO PURE BAG, IT'S ONE PRICE AND ANOTHER METHOD IS BY VARYING WITH CART SIZE. AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE A FORM OF THAT AND WE GAVE TWO EXAMPLES OF THAT ONE, THE FIRST ONE ON THE LEFT WITH THE VERY SMALL INCREMENTS, 27, 29 AND $31, ACTUALLY MORE CLOSELY RELATE TO WHAT THE ACTUAL COST IS, BECAUSE THE COST IS IN GETTING THE TRUCK THERE AND TIPPING IT. IT'S REALLY NOT THAT MUCH DIFFERENT TO TIP A $32-GALLON CART VERSUS A 64-GALLON CART AND PROCESSING THE MATERIAL, BUT SOME COMMUNITIES TAKE TO EQUATE THEIR FEES  FEES BASED ON THE SF THE CHART. THAT'S THE CHART THERE ON THE RIGHT AT 27, 54 AND 81. SO AT INCREMENT AS THE CART DOUBLES, THE PRICE DOUBLES. NOT REALLY EQUAL TO THE TRUE COST TO DELIVER THAT SERVICE. THE NUMBERS ARE ALMOST IDENTICAL. AND PEOPLE ARE OKAY ON THAT SIZE. THEY ARE NOT LOOKING FOR THE FLAT CHARGE. AND AGAIN, TRIA I WILL TRY TO KP MOVING US THROUGH. THE COST MODEL. THIS THE OPPORTUNITY WHERE WE TRULY TOOK OUR EXISTING FINANCIAL DATA AND ACTUAL AUDITED BOOK DATA. THE CONSULTANT AND THEIR TEAM TOOK THAT AND THEN SLICED IT AND DICED IT, IF YOU WILL AND TOOK THEIR GIN-SU KNIVES AND FIGURED OUT ALONG TRASH, RECYCLING PROGRAMS AND CUSTOMER, RESIDENTIAL, COMMERCIAL, WHATEVER THOSE COSTS TO PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES. AND TO BRING THEM DOWN TO A DOLLAR CRISIS. DHH. DOLLARS PER HOUSEHOLD. THESE ARE STANDARD OR DOLLARS PER TON. WE CAN COMPARE APPLES TO APPLES ACROSS THOSE STREAMS AND THE VALUE OF THIS ANALYSIS TO BE ABLE TO COMPARE AND BENCHMARK AND HELP TO DEVELOP OPTIONS AND LOOK AT RECOMMENDATIONS GOING FORWARD. SO I WILL RUN THROUGH SOME SLIDES HERE OF WHAT THE ANALYSIS, RESULTS? WHAT DOES IT TELL US? ON THE EXPENSE SIDE OVERALL, AND TO TRY TO EXPLAIN THIS REAL BUSY SLIDE, THE PIE CHART REPRESENTS ALL THE SOLID WASTE FUND. THE OR RANGE, APPROXIMATELY THREE-QUARTERS ARE THE DIRECT OPERATIONAL EXPENSES. SO THINGS TIED TO WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO PICK UP MATERIAL IN A CART? A DUMPSTER AND GET TO THE PEND FOR PROCESSING AND GET IT PROCESSED. THE LABOR, THE FUEL, THE EQUIPMENT, ALL OF THOSE THINGS. THEN THE REMAINING 25%ISH IS PRETTY WELL EQUALLY DIVIDED BY MY EYE. THE GRAY PORTION ARE THOSE, IF YOU WANT TO THINK OF IT AS OVERHEAD. SO ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS, CUSTOMER SERVICE TO SUPPORT THOSE OPERATIONS, OUR GOOD OLD MUNICIPAL SERVICE CHARGE. WE HAVE TO PAY FOR THE LIGHTS TO KEEP US RUNNING, FOR THE I.T. FOR ALL THE FOLKS IN THERE. AND THEN THE RED PORTION BEING THOSE FINANCIAL ADJUSTMENTS, WHICH ARE GOING TO BE KEY AS I GET THROUGH IN A FEW SLIDES. THOSE THINGS THAT STILL ARE A PART OF OUR GOVERNMENTAL FUNCTION, THE GASB. WE HAVE AN OLD LAND PFILL THAT S BEEN CLOSED BUT IT'S A LIABLE. WE HAVE CAPITAL EQUIPMENT THAT CONTINUES TO DEPRECIATE AND HIT THE BUDGET. THEY GO INTO THE FINANCIAL ADJUSTMENT PORTION OF THE PIE. TO START TO BREAK DOWN THOSE RESULTS AND WHAT THEY TOLD US. FIRST ON THE RESIDENTIAL SIDE OF SERVICE AND TAKE AS TO WHAT THE NUMBERS TELL US, TO BREAK IT DOWN TO A HOUSEHOLD, AND A HOUSEHOLD PER MONTH UNIT, IT'S -- IT COSTS $29.09 TOTAL TO PROVIDE THE SUITE OF SOLID WASTE SERVICES FOR A HOUSEHOLD. AND I WON'T GO THROUGH EACH PIE THERE BUT THAT'S BROKEN DOWN ACROSS TRASH, RECYCLING AND COMPOST, BUT TO POINT OUT THAT SMALL RED PIECE, THE STREET SIDE CANS THAT GOT PUT IN AS A COMPARISON TO OTHER COMMUNITIES, OTHER COMMUNITIES, ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT CONTRACT OUT SERVICES FOR COLLECTIONS, THEY WILL ALSO CONTRACT OUT FOR THEIR STREET LITTER CANS AND FOR EVENTS AND THEY SPREAD THOSE OVER THE RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS IS HOW THAT'S DONE. SO BACK TO THE BENCHMARK TO BE ABLE TO COMPARE APPLES TO APPLES WITH OTHER COMMUNITIES, AND THAT'S WHY THAT'S ADDED THERE. SO THE BAR GRAPH TO THE RIGHT IS THE FURTHER BREAKDOWN OF WHAT'S WITHIN THOSE PIECES OF THE PIE CHART. AND I EXPLAIN AND WALK YOU THROUGH THOSE FROM BASICALLY LEFT TO RIGHT OF EACH SECTION. SO FIRST WITH THE WASTE AS THE EXAMPLE. THE ORANGE BAR ON THE LEFT IS THE LABOR COST. SO THAT'S THE CITY LABOR TO GO OUT AND DO OUR RESIDENTIAL TRASH COLLECTIONS, THE CURB CART COLLECTIONS FOR THE TRASH CARTS. THE NEXT TWO GRAY BARS ARE RELATED TO THE EQUIPMENT. THE FLEET, THE TRUCKS, THE DARKER GRAY IS THE ACTUAL TRUCK ITSELF. IT'S -- NOT TO GET TOO COMPLEX AND BUDGETY FOR YOU, BUT WE LITERALLY PAY FOR THE TRUCKS AND RENT THEM TO OUR FLEET TO GET THE FUNDS TO IMPROVE THOSE TRUCKS, AND THEN THE SECOND CHARGE IS THE ONE TO FUEL THEM. THE REDDISH BAR IS THE COST FOR PROCESSING. SO IF YOU WANT TO SEPARATE THE COLLECTIONS, THAT'S AFTER THE CART IS PUT IN THE TRUCK, THE TRUCK DRIVES TO EITHER THE TRANSFER STATION FOR TRASH, THE MURF FOR RECYCLING OR THE CENTER OR ORGANICS. THEN THAT MATERIAL IS PROCESSED. THAT HAS A COST. THAT'S WHAT THAT RED BAR IS FOR THAT HOUSEHOLD PER MONTH. AND THEN THE BLACK BAR IS THE ADMINISTRATIVE FOR THAT FUNCTION. YOU HAVE THAT FOR THE WASTE, THE SOLID WASTE, THE RECYCLING AND WE WILL GET INTO MORE DETAIL WITH THE ORANGE AND RECYCLE ANN ARBOR AND THE LABOR. THAT'S THEIR CONTRACT COST WHICH, YES, IS FOR THEIR LABOR. THERE'S ALSO OTHER COSTS FOR THAT. THEIR SUPERVISORY AND THEIR ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF, BUT I WILL NOTE THAT IT DOESN'T INCLUDE THE TRUCKS. THE CITY PROVIDES THE TRUCKS. SO THE COST FOR THE TRUCKS ARE IN THE GRAY B B BARS AS WELL. THE REDDISH BAR POINTS OUT THE RECOST OF RECYCLING. THAT'S A CORE VALUE. WE ARE NOT GOING TO STOP BUT THE REALIZATION AND HERE IS IT RIGHT IN FRONT OF US, IS IT COMES AT QUITE A COST. AND THAT HAS BEEN IN THE HEADLINES, AND EVEN COMMUNITIES AROUND US STOPPED THEIR COMPOST. THESE ARE BASED ON FY-18 ACTUALS AND THAT WAS BASED ON THE ACTUAL COST. I WILL POINT OUT IN FY-18 WITH STAFFING SITUATIONS AT THAT TIME, THAT WAS HEAVILY DONE BY TEMPORARY STAFF AND THAT'S NOT THE CASE ANYMORE. SO TO EQUATE IT TODAY, THAT IS SLIGHTLY HIGHER. BUT IT IS LOWER THAN WASTE BECAUSE IT'S STILL A SEASONAL PROGRAM AND DOESN'T HAVE THOSE FULL EXPENSES. TO GET MORE DETAIL, THE ORANGE BAR FOR THE LABOR, COMPARED TO THE CITY COST. I MENTIONED AND NOTED AND WENT OVER IT QUICKLY, BUT THOSE WERE BASED ON DOLLARS PER HOUSEHOLD PER MONTH. SO SOME QUESTIONS, CONCERNS, AND MOLLY WILL COVER IT TOO WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS, SOME REACTION FROM THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE AND AGAIN AT THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION. CONCERNS WERE RAISED, WELL, THAT'S BY HOUSEHOLD BUT RECYCLE ANN ARBOR AND THEIR CONTRACT AND WHAT THEY ARE PAID IS BASED ON THE CART AND THE TIP. SO IT'S AN APPLES AND ARRANGES. I'M NOT SURE THE NUMBERS ARE WORKING OUT RIGHT. SO THE CONSULTANT AND THIS SLIDE THROUGH WORDS TOOK AND DID THAT ANALYSIS AND CHANGED IT FROM PER HOUSEHOLD BUT DID THE COMPARISON PER CART. AND SO THE LEFT SIDE BULLETS COMPARE THE RECYCLE ANN ARBOR CAR COLLECTION CONTRACT COST. SO AGAIN THE RECYCLE ANN ARBOR FEE IS THEIR LABOR, PLUS THEIR CONTRACT MANAGEMENT, SUPPORT FOR THAT, INJOYCING US AND THEIR PIECE OF CUSTOMER SERVICE PART OF IT. AND SO FOR THAT CONTRACT IN FY-18, THAT'S WHAT WE WERE BASED ON. THEY WERE PAID $4 FOR EACH CART THAT THEY TIPPED AND THEY WERE PAID $8.74 PER TON. WHEN YOU PUT THAT ACROSS ALL THE COSTS, IT WAS $4.49 PER CART PER MONTH IS WHAT THE CITY PAID TO RECYCLE NASH. ANN ARBOR AND FOR US, THE COST OF THE CITY IN ANALYSIS, THAT'S A COST. THERE'S BEEN SOME QUESTIONS AND THINGS IS THAT THE COST OF RECYCLE ANN ARBOR. I CAN SAY THAT'S WHAT OUR CONTRACT IS. THAT'S WHAT WE PAY. AND THAT'S WHAT IT IS. AGAIN, IN ADDITION, THE CITY HAS THE FLEET COSTS THAT WE PROVIDE THE FLEET, THE TRUCKS, THE REPAIRS AND THE MAINTENANCE FOR THOSE FLEETS AS WELL. IT'S A VERY UNIQUE SITUATION. THEY HAVEN'T SEEN THAT WHERE A CITY IS ACTUALLY PROVIDING IT TO A CONTRACT PROVIDER. SO THEN AS THE COMPARATIVE OVER ON TO THE RATE AND SEEING MY TIME, I WILL GET GOING. BUT THE CITY COST BY COMPARISON IS IT'S 44 PER CART PER MONTH. SO THAT LEAVES US STILL AT $2.05 CART PER MONTH DIFFERENCE, AND THE CITY COST TO TIP THE CART AT THE CURB VERSUS WHAT THE CONTRACT WITH RECYCLE ANN ARBOR FOR THE RECYCLING. SO ANOTHER KEY PIECE. COMMERCIAL. WE HAVE WASTE MANAGEMENT THAT IS A COMMERCIAL SERVICE. THEIR COST IS IN THE FAR RIGHT. THE ORANGE IS THE PER LIFT COST. SO THAT INCLUDES LABOR, BUT THEN THE' QTHE EQUIPMENT AS WELL. THIS IS A MORE CONSOLIDATED PRESENTATION OF THESE COSTS AND NOT LIKE THE RESIDENTIAL ONE AND THEN THE PROCESSING BEING THAT DARKER COLOR AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS ABOVE THAT. SO WASTE MANAGEMENT'S COSTS IS TO THE RIGHT AND THEN THE OTHER THREE BARS ARE ASPECTS THAT WE DO NICHE WORK BUT IN THAT COMMERCIAL AREA OF REAR LOAD WASTE, MULTIFAMILY WASTE AND FRONT LOAD OR DUMPSTER RECYCLING. SO I TALKED ABOUT EXPENSES AND HERE FOR THE FIRST TIME COMPARED TO THE REVENUES. ON THE LEFT SIDE, A BAR GAFF. GRAPH.I WILL FLIP THROUGH QUICKI WILL EXPLAIN, BUT NOTICE THE REVENUES ARE ON THE RIGHT AND WHAT MAKES UP THE REVENUES, WHETHER IT'S THE SOLID WASTE MILLAGE, ACROS ACROSS BOTH THE RESIDENTIAL AND THE COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES AND OTHER FEES AND REVENUES WE GET, FOR EXAMPLE ON OUR SHARE OF RECYCLABLE COMMODITIES. AND THEN ON THE RIGHT ARE THE EXPENSES. SO BASICALLY SUMMING UP THE DATA THAT I JUST WENT THROUGH ON A RESIDENTIAL ALL CONSOLIDATED COMMERCIAL. AND THEN THE ADJUSTMENTS AT THE TOP. THE LANDFILL LIABILITY AND THE FINANCIAL ADJUSTMENTS. SO TO LAY IT OUT AND TO THAT POINT OF FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY, WHAT THE ANALYSIS SHOWED FOR FY-18, IN TERMS OF OUR DAY-TO-DAY OPERATIONS, OPERATIONALLY, REVENUE AND EXPENSES, PRETTY DARN CLOSE. 16.6 ON THE REVENUE SIDE, AND 16.1 WE ACTUALLY HAD A NET OF HALF A MILLION DOLLARS OF -- OF SURPLUS, BUT IT'S WHEN YOU BRING IN THOSE ADJUSTMENTS, THOSE THINGS THAT ARE STILL AROUND, THAT WILL BE AROUND, THAT LANDFILL LIABILITY THAT CONTINUED DEPRECIATION, THE RETIREE BENEFIT, THE ACCOUNTING PROCEDURES AND WE DON'T -- WHO KNOWS WHAT ACCOUNTING PROCEDURES WILL COME LATER IN FY-18 THAT WAS A $2.4 MILLION NUMBER HIT AND SO THE NET WAS $1.8 MILLION DEFICIT THAT HAD TO BE PULLED FROM THE FUND BALANCE TO MAKE THAT UP. SO WE'RE DRAWING DOWN THE BALANCE JUST AS IS. SO TO MOVE FORWARD, MY LAST REVENUE-RELATED SLIDE, BRING THIS IN. JUST TO OWE THE IMPACTS AND THE EFFECTS OF COMMODITIES AND RECYCLING. RECYCLING COMES AT A COST. THERE IS SOME VALUE REVENUE. IT IS -- THERE ARE COMMODITIES THAT CAN HAVE VALUE BUT COMMODITIES LIKE MOST IF NOT ALL MARKS FLUCTUATE. THIS IS A GRAPH OF THE DATA OF OUR REVENUE SHARE FROM THE CONTRACT WITH RECYCLE ANN ARBOR FOR PROCESSING OUR RECYCLABLES WHERE WE GET A SHARE OF THAT REVENUE AND SO CALCULATING BECAUSE IT'S BASED ON THE MARKETS, THIS IS HOW OUR SHARE ON A PER TON BASIS HAS BEEN DOING, NOT VERY WELL OVER THE TWO YEARS, THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF THAT CONTRACT. SO TO SHOW THAT IT HAS FURTHER IMPACT AND UNTIL THE MARKETS COME BACK, WE SHOULDN'T BE LOOKING FOR ADDED REVENUE ON THE RECYCLE SIDE. I'M NEARLY DONE WITH PROCESS AND THEN I WILL TURN IT OVER TO MOLLY ON THE RECOMMENDATIONS. I WILL BREEZE OVER PEER COMMUNITY BENCHMARKING. I LOOKED AT HIGH PERFORMING, BIG TEN AND MICHIGAN COMMUNITIES FOR THOSE THINGS WE CAN COMPARE AGAINST. AND I WILL STEP ASIDE AND LET MOLLY HIT ON RECOMMENDATIONS.
01:36:11.391: >> I NEED TO TALK FAST BECAUSE I'M RUNNING OUT OF TIME. BEFORE I GET INTO THE RECOMMENDATIONS. I WANT TO GO THROUGH THE KEY DRIVERS. FIRST THE RESIDENTIAL SECTOR. WE HAVE SOLID BENCHMARK AND IT'S TO BUILD ON THE EXISTING SERVICES AND TO OFFER NEW SERVICES. SIMILARLY, ON THE COMMERCIAL SECTOR, WE WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO OFFER NEW SERVICES, COMMERCIAL ORGANICS COMES TO MIND. BUT ALSO IMPORTANTLY, WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE BUSINESSES RIGHT NOW THAT ARE NOT PARTICIPATING IN TRASH AND RECYCLING COLLECTION. SO EITHER THROUGH THE COMMERCIAL FRANFRANCHISE AGREEMENT OR PARTICIPATING IN RECYCLING AGREEMENT WHICH IS REQUIRED BY ORDINANCE. WE DON'T HAVE THE MEANS TO DO THE OUTREACH AND THE ENFORCEMENT NEEDED TO BRING THOSE BUSINESSES INTO COMPLIANCE WHICH WOULD THEN INCREASE OUR DIVERSION. SO THAT WAS A DRIVER FOR ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS, OR FOR THE RECOMMENDATIONS. AND THEN FINALLY, SIGH, THE ALLEYS AND THE DOWNTON AREA. WE KNOW THAT WE MUST IMPROVE CONDITIONS. IT HELPS WITH THE LOOK AND THE SAFETY, BUT WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN IS OVERALL CHANGES AS TO HOW WE MANAGE SAL EDUCATION CAMPAIGN -- SOLID WASTE IN THE DOWNTOWN. SO ONE OF THE KEY OBJECTIVES WAS TO COME UP WITH RECOMMENDATIONS AND A STRATEGY FOR IMPLEMENTING THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT'S ATTAINABLE AND FISCALLY SUSTAINABLE. WE NEED TO BALANCE THOSE FISCAL CONDITIONS AND THE CUSTOMERS' WILLINGNESS TO PAY WITH OUR OPERATIONAL INTERESTS WHILE STILL PROVIDING A HIGH QUALITY OF SERVICE. WE CAN'T START TO ADD NEW PROGRAMS BECAUSE WE RUN THE RISK THEN OF LOWERING OUR SERVICE LEVEL AND WE DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN. SO WITH THAT IN MIND, SWRMP DREW FROM THE BENCHMARK COMMUNITIES, THE DATA COLLECTED FROM THOSE, ALONG WITH THE COST OF SERVICE ANALYSIS. OPTIONS, BROAD OPTIONS WERE PRESENTED TO STAFF, AND THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE. AND FROM THERE, THEN ARE THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT YOU SEE IN FRONT OF YOU. I WILL SAY THAT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE SEVERAL SLIDES LIKE THIS, THEY ARE LIED OUT THE SAME, STARTING ON THE LEFT, YOU HAVE THE RECOMMENDATION, AND THEN THE RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS NEEDED TO IMPLEMENT THIS RECOMMENDATION ALONG WITH THE ANTICIPATED COST, AND THE IMPACT ON DIVERSION AND GREEN HOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. SO I WILL JUST RUN THROUGH THOSE RESIDENTIAL RECOMMENDATIONS. AT THE TOP OF THE LIST, YOU HAVE HEARD TODAY AND FOR MANY YEARS, YEAR UNYEAR ROUND COMPOST COLLE. IF IMPLEMENTED, THE CITY WOULD BE ONE OF THE FEW COMMUNITIES IN THE COUNTRY TO OFFER YEAR ROUND FOOD WASTE COLLECTION AND THAT WOULD BE QUITE A FEAT IN A COLD CLIMATE LIKE THAT TOO. WE'RE UM FOR THE CHALLENGE. LET'S DO IT. THERE'S A COST, THOUGH FOR THAT AS WE TALKED ABOUT WE HAVE TINNEDTOFIND FUNDING FOR THAT. WE ARE ESTIMATING THIS COST. REALLY THIS DOES BUILD ON, AGAIN, THE EXISTING SERVICES THAT ARE OFFERED IN THE COMMUNITY. WHICH IS TO OFFER CURBSIDE TEXTILE COLLECTION. THERE'S ACTUALLY NO COST TO THE CITY, NEIGHBORING COMMUNITIES AND PEER COMMUNITIES THAT WERE BENCHMARKED HAVE THIS SERVICE AND THIS PROVIDES AN OPTION FOR RESIDENTS THAT EITHER DON'T HAVE THE MEANS OR THE INCLINATION TO TAKE THEIR CLOTHING AND THEIR LINENS TO A DONATION CENTER OR A THRIFT SHOP. THOSE OPTIONS ARE STILL AVAILABLE. THIS WOULD JUST BE ANOTHER ALTERNATIVE TO THAT. THIRD ON THE LIST IS BULKY ITEM COLLECTION AS CRESS MENTIONED IN THE RESIDENT SURVEY, RESIDENTS SAID THAT THEY WANT TO SEE CURBSIDE BULKY ITEM COLLECTION AND YEAR ROUND SERVICE COLLECTION THOSE ARE THE ITEMS THEY WANT TO SEE ADDED. BULKY ITEM COLLECTION, AGAIN, WOULD BE IN ADDITION TO WHAT IS ALREADY OFFERED. WE HAVE DROPOFF CENTERS. OUR DROPOFF STATION, THE REUSE CENTER, THOSE WILL STILL BE AVAILABLE. THIS IS JUST ANOTHER OPTION FOR PEOPLE, AND IS PARTICULARLY OF ON FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE AGING IN PLACE. PEOPLE THAT HAVE MOBILITY ISSUES, PEOPLE THAT DON'T HAVE A MEANS TO GET A MULL BEINGY ITEM TO A DROP -- A BULKY ITEM TO A DROPOFF CENTER. THE COST, THAT ASSUMES THAT IF THE CITY STAFF TO WERE TO DO THIS AND THIS WOULD BE SPREAD OUT OVER EVERY HOUSEHOLD. THIS COULD BE OFFSET IF YOU CHARGED A FEE FOR THAT SERVICE. SO YOU COULD -- ONLY THEN THE USERS WOULD PAY IN. SO THAT COULD BE MODIFIED. THE NEXT RECOMMENDATION IS FOR EWASTE, AND HOUSEHOLD HAZARDOUS WASTE COLLECTION. AGAIN, EXPANDING ON WHAT'S OFFERED ALREADY IN THE COMMUNITY, WE COULD EASILY LEVERAGE PARTNERSHIPS WITH OTHERS IN THE REGION AND OUR CONTRACTORS TO OFFER CURBSIDE COLLECTION, IN-HOME COLLECTION FOR A FEE. THAT'S WHY THERE'S NO COST ON THAT ONE, FOR THE USERS THAT MAY WANT THAT. AND THEN LAST, BUT MOST CERTAINLY NOT LEAST TALKED ABOUT IS CONSOLIDATED RESIDENTIAL COLLECTION. IN ESSENCE, THIS MEANS THAT THE CITY WOULD COLLECT ALL TRASH, COMPOST AND RECYCLING FROM CURBSIDE RESIDENTIAL CARTS. IT ADDS SEVEN FT Es TO THE CITY'S ORG CHART. IT COMES AT A SAVINGS OF $775,000 APPROXIMATELY AND THAT'S BASED ON THAT COST MODEL THAT CRESS TALKED ABOUT. AS MOST OF YOU KNOW, THERE HAVE BEEN CONCERNS RAISED ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR RECOMMENDATION AND SO WHAT WAS THE RATIONALE THEN FOR CONSOLIDATED RESIDENTIAL COLLECTION? SIMPLY PUT AND CRESS MENTIONED THIS AT THE BEGINNING, THE CITY HAS AN UNNECESSARILY COMPLEX OPERATIONAL MODEL. WE DON'T HAVE TO BE AS COMPLEX AS WE ARE AND IT ERODES OUR SERVICE LEVEL. WE HAVE AN EXTRA ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN BY HAVING TWO POINTS OF CONTACT ON THE RESIDENTIAL SECTOR. EVERY TIME A RESIDENT NEEDS A CART REPAIR OR A CHANGE IN SERVICE OR HEY A PROBLEM IN SEHEY MIGHT HAVE TO MAKE MULTIPLE PHONE CALLS. IT INCREASES SERVICE EFFICIENCY AND THAT WE WOULD HAVE MORE FLEET AND MORE STAFFING, WHICH WOULD GIVE US MORE FLEXIBILITY IN OUR ROUTING AND TO ADJUST STAFFING DURING HIGH DEMAND PERIODS, OR TO PROVIDE SOME OF THE SERVICE LIKE WE TALKED ABOUT, THE BULKY ITEM COLLECTION OR AS WE GET TO SOME EXTRA TIPS IN THE STUDENT AREA DURING MOVE-IN AND MOVE OUT. IT'S CONSISTENT TO PROVIDE SERVICE ALONG SECTOR. SO SEPARATING OUT RESIDENTIAL FROM COMMERCIAL IS COMMON PRACTICE IN THE INDUSTRY AND IS CONSISTENT WITH ALL OF THE BENCHMARK COMMUNITIES THAT WERE EVALUATED. AND, AGAIN, THAT COST SAVINGS IS ON THERE OF  775,000. AND IF YOU NOTICE HERE, IT DOES SAY ADDITION OF FOUR TO RECEIVE SEVENROUTE DRIVERS WHICH IS WHAI SAID BEFORE, SEVEN. SEVEN IS STRICTLY IF YOU BROUGHT IN ALL OF THE CURBSIDE RESIDENTIAL RECYCLING COLLECTION AND DIDN'T MAKE ANY CHANGES. THE NUMBER COULD VARY, DEPENDING ON WHAT HAPPENS WITH COMMERCIAL COLLECTION, WHICH WE'LL GET TO IN A MINUTE. ACTUALLY, WE WILL GET TO IT NOW. SO ON THE COMMERCIAL RECOMMENDATIONS. THE FIRST RECOMMENDATION IS ON FATS, OILS AND GREASE, BETTER KNOWN AS F.O.G. THIS IS A PROBLEM IN OUR ALLEYS IN PARTICULAR IN THE DOWNTOWN AREA. WE NEED TO SET STANDARDS FOR THE CONTAINER TO ENSURE WE DON'T HAVE SPILLS AND WE NEED TO HAVE ENFORCEMENT OF THOSE STANDARDS. RIGHT NOW WE DON'T HAVE THAT AND THIS RECOMMENDATION WOULD PUT THAT RECOMMENDATION IN PLACE SO WE CAN GO OUT AND TRY TO HELP TO CLEAN UP THE ALLEYS. RIGHT NOW, RESTAURANTS, CONTRACT ON THE OPEN MARK FOR GREASE COLLECTION AND THAT'S FINE. IT'S JUST THAT WE NEED TO SET THE POSSIBILITIES. MANY PEOPLE WOULD SHARE CONTAINERS BECAUSE WE WILL NEED TO MAKE SPACE IF WE LOOK AT THE SECOND RECOMMENDATION WHICH IS COMMERCIAL ORGANICS COLLECTION. THIS IS, AGAIN, AN ADDED SERVICE. THERE'S A VERY SMALL NUMBER OF RESTAURANTS RIGHT NOW THAT INFORMALLY HAVE THIS PROGRAM. THIS WOULD FORMALIZE THE PROGRAM AND BE ABLE TO OFFER COMMERCIAL ORGANICS COLLECTION TO RESTAURANTS, NOT JUST IN THE DOWNTOWN BUT THROUGHOUT THE CITY. THE COST HERE COULD BE OFFSET IF THIS WERE A SUBSCRIPTION-BASED SERVICE AND THAT IS A RECOMMENDATION IN THE PLAN. IT ALSO ADDS STAFFING, AS YOU CAN SEE. THIS, AGAIN, COULD BE MODIFIED IF COMMERCIAL ORGANICS COLLECTION WERE ROLLED INTO A CONSOLIDATED COMMERCIAL COLLECTION CONTRACT. THE THIRD RECOMMENDATION ON COMMERCIAL RECOMMENDATIONS IS STUDENT MOVE IN AND MOVE OUT SUPPORT. WE PROVIDE ALREADY MOVE IN AND MOVE OUT SUPPORT. WE CONTRACT WITH RECYCLE ANN ARBOR FOR A DROPOFF CENTER. NONE OF THAT 1:00 PROPOSED TO CHANGE. -- NONE OF THAT IS PROPOSED TO CHANGE. WE ARE PUTTING THIS IN THE STUDENT AREA. IT'S A STRUGGLE EVERY YEAR FOR US TO PROVIDE THE LEVEL OF SERVICE THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE. SO YOU CAN SEE HERE THERE'S A COST FOR THAT AS WELL. ANOTHER THING THAT COULD BE OFFSET IF WE HAD FEES FOR THAT SERVICE. CONSTRUCTION AND DEMOLITION. IT'S NOT BEEN TALKED ABOUT A WHOLE LOT SINCE THE LAST ONE. THIS WOULD BE A PHASED APPROACH AND WHAT YOU ARE SEEING IS THE FIRST PHASE WHICH IS TO CREATE AN ORDINANCE AND THEN A TRACKING MECHANISM. SO WHEN SOMEONE IS HAVING A CONSTRUCTION PROJECT, THEY CAN ACTUALLY TRACK THE AMOUNT OF DEBRIS THAT WE ARE PRODUCING AND ONCE WE GATHER DATA OVER SEVERAL YEARS OR, YOU KNOW, HOWEVER LONG THIS TAKES TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE GOOD, STEADY NUMBERS AND THEN WE CAN SET STANDARDS AND DIVERSION TARGETS FOR THAT. COMMERCIAL PARTICIPATION ENFORCEMENT. I MENTIONED THAT AS ONE OF THE DRIVERS. THIS ONE COMES WITH A PRETTY HIGH PRICE TAG AND MOST OF THE COSTS IN THAT IS NOT THE OUTREACH AND ENFORCEMENT TO BRING PEOPLE INTO COMPLIANCE. IT'S ACTUALLY ONCE YOU INCREASE PARTICIPATION, YOU DO A FANTASTIC JOB OF INCREASING DIVERSION BUT WE KNOW WE SAW THE RECYCLING PROCESSING COSTS WERE QUITE HIGH. THIS IS WHERE THE COSTS ARE COMING IN AT. AND THEN FINALLY, CONSOLIDATED COMMERCIAL COLLECTION. AGAIN, SIMILAR TO CONSOLIDATED RESIDENTIAL COLLECTION, SEPARATING OUT SERVICE BY SECTOR IS KIND OF INDUSTRY STANDARD. IT MAKES THINGS SIMPLE AND IT'S MORE EFFICIENT AND SO THAT'S WHY IT'S A RECOMMENDATION IN THE PLAN THIS IS A REDUCTION HERE SHOWN OF THREE STAFF. THOSE STAFF WOULD HAVE BEEN REASSIGNED TO THE RESIDENTIAL PROGRAM, THOUGH, AS PART OF THESE RECOMMENDATIONS, AS CRAIG MENTIONED AT THE VERY BEGINNING, THESE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE INTERTWINED. IT'S REALLY HARD TO SEPARATE OUT ONE FROM ANOTHER. SOME OF THEM, A LITTLE BIT EASIER BUT A LOT OF THE BIG ONES, THEY ARE MIXED TOGETHER. OKAY. EDUCATION AND OUTREACH. SO THE RECOMMENDATION IS TO HAVE EDUCATION AND OUTREACH. A FULL-TIME EMPLOYEE WHO IS FOCUSING ON MARKETING AND MAY HAVE A MARKETING BACKGROUND MORE THAN A SOLID WASTE BACKGROUND. IT WOULD BE A MIX. BUT THE FOCUS THEN WOULD BE TO START AN ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN, START GRASS ROOTS OUTREACH, AND GIVE SUPPORT THAT WE KNOW IS NEEDED TO INCREASE OUR PARTICIPATION AND MOVE THAT NEEDLE AND DIVERSION. THERE IS NO DIVERSION AND GREEN HOUSE GAS EMISSIONS LISTED HERE. IT'S HARD TO TRACK AS YOU MAKE PROGRAMMATIC CHANGES AT THE SAME TIME. SO THESE COSTS FOR THESE RECOMMENDATIONS, COULD BE OFFSET, SOME IF THE CITY WERE TO JOIN WRRMA, AGAIN THAT ECONOMY OF SCALE THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT THROUGH MATERIALS. WE RECOGNIZE, THOUGH THAT, THE CITY IS DISTINCT AND UNIQUE, AND WE NEED TO HAVE FOCUSED DEDICATION AND STAFF TO THE SOLID WASTE PROGRAMS AND SO THIS RECOMMENDATION REMAINS IN HERE REGARDLESS OF WHAT HAPPENS WITH WRRMA. OKAY. DOWNTOWN AREA SERVICE RECOMMENDATIONS, THIS IS TIED SOMEWHAT TO THE COMMERCIAL -- WILL CONSOLIDATED COMMERCIAL COLLECTION BUT IT CAN BE A STANDALONE AS WELL. MOST LEARNLY, THE PLAN IDENTIFIED PROBLEMS IN THE DOWNTOWN AND WE HEARD LOUD AND CLEAR FROM STAKEHOLDERS THAT WE NEED TO IMPROVE SERVICE AND WE DON'T DISAGREE. ONE OF THOSE IS MANDATORY SATURDAY AND SUNDAY COLLECTION. RESTAURANTS ARE BUSY AND THEORIETHEYARE BUSIEST ON THE W. THE NUMBER OF CARTS ON THE ALLEY ARE BASED ON PEAK DEMAND. IF THE BUSINESSES ARE NOT GETTING SERVICE ON SUNDAY, THEN THEY ARE SIZED FOR TWO DAYS WORTH OF TRASH OR RECYCLING. WE THINK THAT THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY, AGAIN, TO GET RID OF SOME OF THE CONTAINERS THROUGH THAT AND ALSO THROUGH CONSOLIDATED CONTAINER DESIGN, WHICH MEANS PEOPLE SHARING COMPACTORS AND CONTAINERS. AND SO I THOUGHT THAT WAS LIKE MY ALARM, LIKE, EVERYBODY STOP! I HAVE TO STOP TALKING. SO THROUGH SHARING CONTAINERS, WE MAKE ROOM IN THE ALLEY, BECAUSE WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE COMMERCIAL ORGANICS COLLECTION, WE HAVE GOT TO HAVE SPACE FOR THE FOOD WASTE. AND THEN FINALLY THE RECOMMENDATION TO PROCURE A SINGLE DOWNTOWN SERVICE PROVIDER, THE DOWNTOWN IS UNIQUE. AND IT SHOULD BE TREATED UNIQUE. THERE ARE SERVICE CHALLENGES IN THE DOWNTOWN THAT DON'T EXIST ELSEWHERE, AND BY PROCURING A SINGLE SERVICE PROVIDER, YOU COULD SET UP A MODEL SIMILAR TO WHAT THE -- WHAT HAS WITH THE BIZ, AND REALLY PROVIDE A HIGHER LEVEL OF SERVICE WHERE THE FEES ARE MORE EQUITABLE AND ALL BUSINESSES ARE PAYING IN. THAT COULD HAPPEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH OR INDEPENDENT OF THE CONSOLIDATED COMMERCIAL CONTRACT. AND THEN I WILL TOUCH BRIEFLY, CRESSON ALREADY MENTIONED THIS PLAN SPECIFICALLY DID NOT EVALUATE THE DROPOFF STATION OR THE MURF, BUT IT DOES SUPPORT THE RECOMMENDATION TO WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH THE COUNTY AT A REGIONAL LEVEL TO REPLACE THE DROPOFF STATION. AND ALSO SUPPORTS THE CITY'S EFFORTS RIGHT NOW TO PROCURE AN OPERATOR FOR THE MURF. FUNDING RECOMMENDATIONS, WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THE OF THE COST SAVINGS ALREADY THAT COULD BE HAD A IF WE HAVE CONSOLIDATED RECOMMENDATIONS. OTHER OPTIONS ARE MILLAGE INCREASE AND I WOULD VIEW THAT IN LIEU OF THE CONSOLIDATED COLLECTION OPTION. THE COST SAVINGS THAT YOU WILL GET FROM THAT SHOULD HELP TO COVER THE COST FOR MOST OF THE SERVICES THAT WE'RE PLANNING TO RECOMMEND TO IMPLEMENT. THE THIRD OPTION THIS IS A WASTE DIVERSION SURCHARGE AND THIS IS EITHER PER HOUSEHOLD OR IT COULD BE THE RESIDENTIAL SECTOR OR THE COMMERCIAL AND THE RESIDENTIAL SECTOR AND IT'S REALLY A PER USER CHARGE TO OFFSET SOME OF THE COSTS. RECYCLING PROCESSING WE KNOW IS HIGH AND THIS WOULD HELP TO SUBSIDIZE THAT. OKAY SO WE TOOK THESE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE AND THE FEEDBACK WAS THERE WERE A LOT OF SUPPORT FOR MOST OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE PLAN, INCLUDING SERVICE EXPANSION, SERVICE IMPROVEMENT, AND EDUCATION AND OUTREACH. THERE WERE TEN PARTICIPANTS OF THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE HAVE VOICED STRONG OPPOSITION TO THE RECOMMENDATION FOR CONSOLIDATED RESIDENTIAL COLLECTION. AND REASONS THAT THEY GIVE FOR THEIR OPPOSITION, THEY FEEL THERE'S ADDED VALUE FOR THE CURRENT CONTRACTOR FOR THAT SERVICE AND CONCERNS ABOUT THE QUALITY OF THE STREAM IF WE WERE TO TAKE THAT RECYCLING COLLECTION WITH CITY STAFF. AND THEN ALSO THE QUESTIONING OF THE VALIDITY OF THE COST SAVING ANALYSIS WHICH CRESS HAS TOUCHED ON. SOME I WILL SHOW YOU ONE MORE SLIDE ON THAT TO COMPARE THE COSTS OF RECYCLING COLLECTED -- COLLECTED FROM RECYCLE ANN ARBOR, VERSUS THE CITY. AND YOU CAN SEE THIS IS WHERE WE GET THAT $775,000. IT STARTS OFF AT JUST OVER 1 MILLION, BUT WE HAVE ADJUSTED THE COSTS DOWNWARD, RECOMMENDING THAT WHEN THESE NUMBERS WERE PUT TOGETHER WE HAD TEMPORARY LABOR PERFORMING SOME OF THE WORK. AND SO, AGAIN, A KEY COMPONENT IS THAT WE CAN'T MOVE FORWARD WITH ONE RECOMMENDATION WITHOUT IT IMPACTING ANOTHER RECOMMENDATION. AND SO THEY ARE TIED TO GO. THEY ARE INTERRELATED. AND WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD. CONSOLIDATED RESIDENTIAL COLLECTION. AND CONSOLIDATED COMMERCIAL COLLECTION, THEY ARE ALL TIED TO GO. THE LAST THREE BULLETS, PROCURING THE MANDATORY SATURDAY, SUNDAY IT COULD BE ROLLED UP IN THE CONSOLIDATED COMMERCIAL COLLECTION. WITH THAT, I THINK I WILL TURN IT BACK OVER TO YOU TO WRAP UP.
01:53:48.781: >> JUST ANOTHER COUPLE OF SLIDES UNDER OTHER ACTIVITIES. AGAIN, WE HAVE THREE MAJOR CONTRACTS, THE MRF, THAT'S CONTRACTED THROUGH RECYCLE ANN ARBOR. IT WILL BE EXPIRING THE END OF THIS FISCAL YEAR, JUNE 30th. IT DOES HAVE AN OPTION -- ALL OF THESE ARE SET TO EXPIRE JUNE 30th, 2020, AND DO HAVE AN OPTION FOR ONE YEAR. BUT AS CRAIG SAID AT THE BEGINNING THERE'S LEAD TIME INVOLVED WITH TRUCKS, BUT THIS ONE IN PARTICULAR, IF WE ARE GOING TO HAVE SOMEONE COME IN TO REEQUIP MRF, WHICH IS AN OPTION THAT IS BEING ASKED AND SOUGHT THAT HAS A LOT OF LEAD TIME TOO. WE DO HAVE AN RFP ACTUALLY ON THE STREET FOR THAT PARTICULAR CONTRACT, AND LOOKING FOR THOSE PROPOSALS NO SEE IF THE CONTRACTORS CAN REEQUIP THAT MRF AND GET US UP RECYCLING. THE PROPOSALS ARE DUE ON SEPTEMBER 17th AND WE ARE TARGETING TO COME BACK TO CITY COUNCIL SECOND MEETING IN OCTOBER. AND I WILL BE HUSTLING AND WORKING ON AN RFP IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS. WE HAVE THE FRANCHISE COMMERCIAL WASTE COLLECTIONS WITH WASTE MANAGEMENT AND THE RECYCLABLES CART COLLECTIONS RECYCLE ANN ARBOR. AND REALLY TWO CONTRACTS EXPIRING THE SAME TIME AND REALLY AS MOLLY PUT IT, THERE'S INTERRELATIONS THERE. WE INTO ED TO REPLACE THOSE CONTRACTS BUT WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE DIRECTION GIVEN, HOW DO WE TAKE THESE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THIS PLAN AND MOVE THEM FORWARD TO IMPLEMENTATION BECAUSE THAT DIRECTION IS GOING TO AFFECT HOW WE PACKAGE THESE REPLACEMENT CONTRACTS OR CONTRACT OR REPLACE THEM JUST IN THE SAME OLD SAME OLD. AND SO THAT'S BACK TO CRAIG'S OPENING POINT. OPENING PONT. THAT'S WHERE TIMELINESS IS KEY. AND THEN LAST, ON STAFFING, PROVIDE A QUICK STAFFING UPDATE, REALIZED FOLKS MAY NOT HAVE REALIZED, BUT IN FY-18, WE DID ADD A BRAND NEW POSITION IN MOLLY'S SHOP DOWN IN PUBLIC WORKS AND A OUTREACH SPECIALIST, YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF JENNY POTOWSKI. SHE'S BEEN WITH US SINCE THE SPRING OF 2018. YOU FOLKS AS PART OF THE LAST BUDGET PROCESS FOR THIS FISCAL YEAR DID APPROVE A NEW FULL-TIME POSITION FOR ENFORCEMENT. THAT'S GOING TO BE FOCUSED ON SOLID WASTE ENFORCEMENT, FUNDED OUT OF THE SOLID WASTE. SO THAT'S ALREADY DONE A THE PUBLIC SERVICES WORKING WITH POLICE AND COMMUNITY STANDARDS TO DEVELOP THAT POSITION, GET THAT UP AND ROLLING AND STAFFED AND THAT ENFORCEMENT FOCUS GOING. WE HAVE A BRAND NEW POSITION THAT'S BEEN CRAFTED, NEW RESOURCE RECOVERY MANAGER, SOME PEOPLE MAY CALL IT A SOLID WASTE MANAGER, SOMEONE THAT WILL TAKE OVER FOR ME AND DO WHAT I HAVE BEEN DOING THE LAST FEW YEARS. THAT IS UNDERWAY, AND ACTUALLY -- A AN OFFER IS OUT. I DON'T WANT TO JINX ANYTHING. I WILL STOP THERE. IT'S ANTICIPATED HOPEFULLY TO HAVE THAT POSITION FILLED HERE IN THE EARLY FALL. AND THEN JUST TO WRAP UP AS MOLLY HIT ON THROUGH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SWRMP RECOMMENDATIONS IF THEY WERE PUT TOGETHER, AS IS, AS CURRENTLY RECOMMENDED, WE WOULD BE LOOKING AT A NET OF FOUR ADDITIONAL SOLID WASTE DRIVER POSITIONS DOWN AT PUBLIC WORKS. UP TO THREE POTENTIALLY. THAT MIGHT BE A LITTLE HEAVY. I'M SURE WE WOULD PHASE THAT IN BUT ON THE CUSTOMER SERVICE SIDE OF THINGS AND THEN A NEW EDUCATION AND OUTREACH LEAD POSITION. SO WITH THAT, I APOLOGIZE FOR THE LENGTH.
01:57:39.278: >> Mayor Taylor: NO, IT'S IMPORTANT STUFF. IT'S 9:00. LET ME PROPOSE THAT WE LIMIT OUR CONVERSATION HERE TO HALF AN HOUR AND THEN WE HAVE PUBLIC COMMENT AFTER THAT. EVERYBODY HAPPY WITH THAT OR CONTENT? COUNCILMEMBER NELSON?
01:57:51.590: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I HAVE JUST HAVE A HANDFUL OF QUESTIONS. SO I HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE FINANCIAL MODEL, LIKE, FROM SLIDE 21, BASED ON FISCAL 2018 COSTS AND THEN SLIDE 29, THE EXPENSES THAT ARE SORT OF COMPARED, I GUESS MY QUESTION WAS:  HOW DID THE LACK OF A FUNCTIONING MRF IMPACT THESE COSTS. IF YOUR COMPARISON IS 2018, HOW WERE OUR COSTS IMPACTED BY THE MRF NOT FUNCTIONING?
01:58:33.031: >> WELL, LET ME SEE IF I CAN -- SO TO LOOK AT THE PIE CHART THERE, THERE'S AN ITEM FOR RECYCLING PROCESSING. THAT WOULD BE AN ALL INCLUSIVE FOR THAT OPERATION. SO I GUESS THE ANSWER WOULD BE THAT THOSE COSTS FOR TRANSPORT -- WE STILL HAVE THE COST FOR PROCESSING. THERE'S A COST FOR PROCESSING AND ACROSS THE INDUSTRY, COSTS FROM EVEN PROBABLY THREE YEARS AGO, BUT EVEN TWO YEARS AGO ARE MUCH DIFFERENT THAN COSTS TODAY FOR PROCESSING, NOT TO GET TOO INTO THE WEEDS BUT QUALITY AND CLEANLINESS, IF YOU WILL, IS KEY AND THAT HAS REALLY UPPED THE COST OF RECYCLING EVERYWHERE. AND SO I THINK THAT'S THERE REGARDLESS, WHETHER WE ARE STILL PROCESSING HERE OR THE MRF IS IN THE CURRENT STATE. BUT THERE'S -- THE TRANSFER COST WOULD BE IN THERE, AS WELL. SO THAT'S THE PIECE THERE. SO I SUPPOSE THAT TO TRY TO GET AT WHAT'S THE IMPACT OR THE EFFECT, I GUESS THE BEST WAY I CAN ANSWER UNFORTUNATELY IS STILL OUT THERE JUST A BIT IS NOW THAT WE HAVE AN RFP OUT LOOKING TO PROCURE WHAT THOSE PRICES ARE IN THE CURRENT MARKET, THAT'S WHERE WE'LL BE ABLE TO REALLY SEE WHAT THE ACTUAL COST DIFFERENCE IS, AS WE HAVE MADE A FOCUS ON BREAKING DOWN AND HAVING PROPOSERS LAY OUT WHAT THOSE COSTS ARE FOR PROCESSING, FOR TRANSPORT, AND ASK WHERE THOSE ITEMS ARE GOING SO THAT WE CAN TRY TO REDUCE THAT GREEN HOUSE IMPACTS AND GET THINGS CLOSER TO HOME AND ENCOURAGE AND LOOK FOR OPTIONS TO REEQUIP THE MRF AND GET US PROCESSING HERE AGAIN.
02:00:19.671: >> BUT DOES THAT HAVE A DIFFERENCE IN THE COLLECTION COST? BECAUSE THE COMPARISON WAS COLLECTION TO COLLECTION? IF -- AND IT'S UNCERTAIN, BUT IF IT IS BETTER RECOVERY BECAUSE SOMEHOW THE MATERIALS ARE LESS CONTAMINATED, THERE'S LESS TRANSPORT COSTS THAT WOULD ACTUALLY SHOW UP IN SAVING IN THE MRF OPERATION, WHICH IS A SEPARATE CONTRACT.
02:00:40.258: >> YES.
02:00:40.525: >> City Admin. Lazarus: IT'S OUT FOR PROCUREMENT NOW.
02:00:43.895: >> YES, IN TERMS OF THE COLLECTION COSTS, I GO TO THIS GRAPH, WHERE THE PROCESSING AND THE MATTER OF MRF SITUATION, THAT RED BAR, YOU TAKE THAT OUT OF THE GAME, IF YOU WILL, THAT'S THAT PIECE OF IT AND WHERE THOSE PIECES ARE. THE ORANGE, AND THE TWO GRAY, THAT'S THE COLLECTIONS.
02:01:04.116: >> Councilmember Nelson: OKAY. MY OTHER QUESTION IS FROM SLIDE 34. THE RATHER DIRE ANALYSIS OF DECREASING FUND BALANCE. I WAS JUST CURIOUS, THE ADJUSTMENTS THAT ARE BULLET POINTED AT THE BOTTOM ABOUT CAPITAL ASSETS, WHAT YEAR WOULD IT HAVE BEEN? WHAT FISCAL YEAR WOULD THE MRF HAVE BEEN COUNTED AS A LOSS OF A CAPITAL ASSET OR HAS IT BEEN CALCULATED AS A LOSS ON A CAPITAL ASSET YET? WE HAVE $6 MILLION ON THE M FACILITY. SO WE ARE TAKING THAT PIECEMEAL. THAT COULD BE A QUESTION, THOUGH, COMING BACK IF -- NOT AGAIN -- MAYBE GETTING AHEAD OF MYSELF IF PROPOSALS TO REEQUIP THE MRF, DEPENDING ON HOW THE NUMBERS COME IN, THERE COULD BE A QUESTION THAT WE NEED TO ANSWER, DO WE TAKE AN ADJUSTMENT FOR THAT UNDEPRECIATED AMOUNT. THE EQUIPMENT COULD BE A COUPLE OF MILLION DOLLARS. YES, THERE MAY BE SOMEONE LOOKING TO EQUIP THE MRF BUT WE MAY HAVE A HIT TO THAT FUND BALANCE TO WRITE OFF THAT OLD EQUIPMENT.
02:02:14.319: >> City Admin. Lazarus: BUT THE PRIMARY COST DIFFERENCE IN THAT WAS THE ONE-THYME WRITEOFF FOR OPEB FUNDING.
02:02:20.725: >> YEAH.
02:02:21.092: >> City Admin. Lazarus: WHICH WAS A PRETTY BIG HIT TO THE FUND.
02:02:23.361: >> YES, THAT WAS FY-18. YEAH.
02:02:27.098: >> City Admin. Lazarus: THE OTHER -- PART OF THE SITUATION WITH THE MRF, THAT THE CITY IS NOT HAVING A LARGE CASH OUTLET AND NOT ADAPT TO THE FUTURE CHANGES IN THE MARKET. THAT'S A RISK SHEDDING APPROACH, WHERE WE DON'T HAVE THAT RISK. SO AT SOME POINT, THAT COST AVOIDANCE WOULD OFFSET THE ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION.
02:02:55.760: >> Councilmember Nelson: OKAY. THANK YOU.
02:02:59.564: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNSELOR EATON.
02:03:01.266: >> Councilmember Eaton: I HAVE TOO MANY QUESTIONS TO ASK YOU TONIGHT AND SO I WILL SUBMIT THEM LATER. WITH REGARD NOT SLIDE WE ARE ON RIGHT NOW, SLIDE 34, THAT EXPENSE FIGURE OF $16 MILLION, THAT INCLUDES THE ADDITIONAL COST OF SHIPPING OUR RECYCLABLES TO SOUTHERN OHIO FOR SORTING, RIGHT? APPROXIMATELY HOW MUCH IS THAT PER MONTH?
02:03:34.733: >> ACTUALLY -- BEAR WITH ME. I'M NOT SURE IF I BROUGHT THE RIGHT SPREADSHEET. I'LL SEE IF I DID.
02:04:01.226: >> City Admin. Lazarus: WHILE CRESS IS LOOKING FOR THAT. THERE'S STILL A COST, EVEN IF IT'S SORTED AT THE LOCAL MRF. I THINK THE CONCLUSION THAT'S BEING DRAWN IS THAT IT WOULD BE LESS COSTLY BUT THERE'S STILL A COST.
02:04:14.639: >> AND TO DIRECTLY ANSWER THE QUESTION, I'M UNABLE TO TELL WHAT THE COST IS FOR THE TRANSPORT, BECAUSE THE CONTRACT AS IT'S STRUCTURED RIGHT NOW IS A COST. SO IT'S INCLUSIVE OF TRANSFER THE SITUATIONS AT OUR MRF TO TRANSPORT, AS WELL AS THE PROCESSING. SO TO DIRECTLY ANSWER THE QUESTION, I'M UNABLE TO ANSWER IT, BUT THAT'S SOMETHING IN THE NEW RFP, WE ASKED FOR THAT BROKEN OUT SEPARATELY AND SPECIFICALLY.
02:04:40.599: >> Councilmember Eaton: CLEARLY THIS EXPENSE LINE IS LIKELY TO DECREASE IF WE ARE NOT BUNDLING THE MATERIALS AND SHIPPING THEM ELSEWHERE.
02:04:56.281: >> WITH THE MARKET THE WAY IT IS AND THE STAND AS THAT ARE IMPOSED, I WILL -- STANDARDS THAT ARE IMPOSED, I WILL UNTIL THE BIDS COME IN.
02:05:08.560: >> City Admin. Lazarus: SO THE CONTAMINATION IS WHEN YOU PUT IT ALL IN THE SAME BIN WHEN YOU HAVE PAPER MIXED IN WITH THE GRASS. GLASS. WITH THE MARKETS DOWN, THEY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE PROCESSED AND SENT SOMEWHERE. TO IT'S A HARD QUESTION TO ANSWER.
02:05:30.215: >> Councilmember Eaton: THAT LEADS ME TO MY LAST QUESTION THIS EVENING AND AISLE SUBMIT OTHER QUESTIONS. DURING THIS ENTIRE PROCESS, WAS THERE ANY DISCUSSION OF ABANDONING OUR SINGLE STREAM RECYCLING METHOD FOR SOMETHING THAT PROTECTS THE MATERIALS THAT WE'RE COLLECTING FROM CROSS CONTAMINATION?
02:05:49.868: >> I HAVE A RECOLLECTION THAT THERE MAY HAVE BEEN SOME INITIAL DISCUSSION, BUT I THINK THE REACTION, THE RESPONSE IS PEOPLE HAVE BECOME SO USED TO SINGLE STREAM TO TRY TO GO BACK TO THE DIAL STREAM, AS WELL AS EVEN THE CAPITAL COST OF ADDED CONTAINERS AND THE EQUIPMENT TO COLLECT IT THAT WAY, IT -- IT DIDN'T ADVANCE. SO THERE WAS PROBABLY -- IT WAS RAISED, BUT NOT FOR VERY LONG.
02:06:18.096: >> Councilmember Eaton: THANK YOU.
02:06:20.465: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, LUMM AND RAMLAWI.
02:06:26.905: >> Councilmember Hayner:  AND SHOULD MY LIST OF QUESTIONS BE DIRECTED TO MR. SLOTTEN. SINGLE STREAM. I REMEMBER THINKING THIS IS NOT A GOOD IDEA AND I DON'T THINK IT WAS. I WILL GET TO THE HOT QUESTIONS HERE. I HAD A QUESTION ON SLIDE -- I'M SORRY, IT WAS SLIDE 30. WE WERE THERE A SECOND AGO. WE TALKED ABOUT TRUCK MAINTENANCE AND TRUCK RENTAL AND COSTS. YOU ARE SHOWING TRUCK, TRUCK RENTAL, TRUCK R & M AND FUEL COSTS. HOW COME THEY ARE NOT ON THE SAME STACK, THAT IS THE COST FOR THE TRUCK ON THE ROAD.
02:06:56.101: >> SO THE TRUCK, TRUCK RENTAL IS A SPECIFIC COST. SO IT'S TRACKED SEPARATELY. AND SO THAT'S BASICALLY -- I WILL LET MARTY KICK ME WHEN I MISSPEAK. BUT THE SOLID WASTE OPERATION IS PAYING OR REPRESENTING IT FROM THE FLEET OPERATION. SO IT'S A SPECIFIC LINE ITEM, AND CAN BE -- CAN BE TRACKED SEPARATELY. ALSO, THERE ARE TIMES WHETHER THE PLE FLEET IS AGING AND WE AE EXPERIENCING THAT WITH THE TRUCKS THAT THE ANN ARBOR RECYCLE AND IN THE HEAVY LEAF SEASON, WE HAVE A RENTAL. WE ARE LEASING TRUCKS FOR TWO MONTHS OR FOUR MONTHS FOR THE HIGH VOLUME. SO THAT'S AN ACTUAL RENTAL RATE. PGH >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER IF I WAS INTERESTED, JUST FOR MY OWN UNDERSTANDING OF ALL OF THIS DATA, IT WOULD BE FAIR TO STACK THOSE TWO UP AND SAY IT'S A COST OF OUR FLOATER FLEET RIGHT THERE.
02:07:52.757: >> CORRECT.
02:07:53.091: >> Councilmember Hayner:  IS THERE ANY TRUTH TO THE RUMOR THAT I HEARD THAT WE ARE HAVING SOME MAINTENANCE ISSUES. ARE THEY BEING RETURNED FOR MAINTENANCE IN A TIMELY MANNER THE WAY WE DO OUR OWN CITY NEATS?
02:08:07.572: >> WE'RE WORKING WITH RECYCLE ANN ARBOR.
02:08:11.943: >> Councilmember Hayner: BECAUSE I KNOW THAT. I HAVE BEEN TO THE GARAGE AND I KNOW THEY HAVE EXCELLENT SOFTWARE THAT RETURN THESE VEHICLES IN THERE, AND THEY FIX THEM.
02:08:18.917: >> WE ARE WORKING WITH RECYCLE ANN ARBOR TRYING TO GET THEM TO COMPLY WITH THE MAINTENANCE SCHEDULES.
02:08:26.157: >> Councilmember Hayner: OKAY. THANK YOU. I GUESS MY ONLY -- I HAD TWO MORE THINGS I WILL SAY QUICKLY. BULKY ITEMS TO ME SEEMS LIKE A STUDENT ISSUE. WHEN I WAS ON A BOARD AT A THRIFT SHOP, WE DID TEXTILE COLLECTION. WE HAD A HECK OF A TIME GETTING PAID FOR THAT AND IT WAS FLUCTUATED WILDLY WITH CURRENCY LEVELS WITH OVERSEA MARKETS AND ALL KINDS OF THINGS AND WE DID A COMPLETE WASTE AUDIT OF EVERYTHING THAT WE DIVERTED THAT WE COULDN'T SELL. WE TRACKED OUR TEXTILES TO AFRICA AND ASIA AND ALL DIFFERENT PLACES. IT WAS A REAL DOG FOR US. IT WAS A REAL LOSER AND WE HAD TO COME BACK AND TAKE OFFERS AND SETTLE ON OUR CONTRACTS CONSTANTLY BECAUSE THEY JUST COULDN'T AFFORD TO COME GET THEM ANYMORE HASN'T THEY WOULD BUILD UP IN OUR FACILITY. I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT GOT IN, THERE BUT I'M NOT A FAN OF IT. AND THEN, YOU KNOW THE SAME THING, LIKE, I WOULD HOPE THAT SOME IMPROVED CUSTOMER SERVICE IS CONSIDERED IN THESE COSTS. WHEN MY COMPOST CART CAME HOME MISSING A WHEEL ONE DAY. THEY SAID SET IT OUT AN FRIDAY. AND I LEFT IT OUT FOR TWO WEEKS AND I CAME BACK TO THE DESK AND THEY SAID, YOU CAN BUY ONE FOR $25. YOU HAVE TO AGAI GET RID OF IT YOURSELF. THAT'S NOT THE TYPE OF CUSTOMER SERVICE. I HAD MANY RESIDENTS WITH SIMILAR CONCERNS. WHAT'S THE WASTE DIVISION SURCHARGE BASED ON BY THE POUND? WHAT'S THE POTENTIAL FOR CALCULATING THAT SURCHARGE? I WILL -- YEAH. I WILL TAKE THE REST OF MY QUESTIONS OFFLINE. I SAW THAT AND THAT STUCK OUT TO ME AS PART OF OUR CONSIDERATION FOR REVENUE AND I JUST WONDERED WHAT MIGHT BE BASED ON. I KNOW SOME YEARS AGO WE WERE FLOATING ABOUT PAYING ABOUT THE POUND WHICH IS NOT SUPER POPULAR.
02:10:14.799: >> YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT WITHIN THE FUNDING OPTIONS.
02:10:17.936: >> Councilmember Hayner: YEAH, THE VARIOUS FUNDING OPTIONS STRETCHING OUT OVER THE COST OF IMPLEMENTING.
02:10:23.308: >> YEAH. THAT WOULD BE ACROSS THE PROPERTIES WITHIN THE COMMUNITY. SO IT'S AN ADDITIONAL CHARGE, BUT IT WOULD BE DONE -- WE -- A KEY PIECE TO THAT JUST MOLLY DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO GET INTO IT, IS -- THE COMMUNITIES IN THE NATION THAT HAVE GONE THAT WAY THAT HAVE THE DIVERSION SURCHARGE. WE WOULD FIRST HAVE TO SEE THE FIRST PART OF THAT EFFORT. IS THERE ENABLING LEGISLATION IN THE STATE OF MICHIGAN FOR US EVEN TO DO THAT, BECAUSE WE ARE COLLECTING THE SOLID WASTE REVENUE, IT'S IN ESSENCE ANOTHER CHARGE ON PROPERTIES. SO WE WOULD HAVE TO EVEN SEE, IS IT -- ARE WE ABLE TO DO THAT AND THAT'S THE FIRST PART OF THAT STEP TO SEE IF THAT'S AN OPTION. SO --
02:11:13.257: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU. IT SOUNDS VERY UNPOPULAR. I WOULDN'T LIKE IT. IT'S A FEE. YEAH, IT'S A FEE. I WILL PUT THE REST IN WRITING.
02:11:25.536: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
02:11:26.671: >> Councilmember Lumm: I WILL ASK A COUPLE. I WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR -- AND I THINK THE STUR STUDY IS EXCEL. IT'S ONE THE BEST REPORTS I RECALL SEEING. THANK YOU FOR ALL THE WORK THAT HAS GONE INTO IT. IT'S VERY WELL DONE, IT'S COMPREHENSIVE, THE DATA, THE ANALYSIS, EXCEEDINGLY WELL DONE, ESPECIALLY THE FINANCIAL MODELING, THE COST OF SERVICE ANALYSIS, ARE THOROUGH, INSIGHTFUL AND PRESENTED IN AN EASY TO UNDERSTAND MANNER. SO THANK YOU. I THINK THE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE REASONABLE, FOCUSED, WEST NILE VIRUS THOUGHT OUT, AND WE HAVE IMPORTANT DECISIONS TO MAKE AS YOU SAID AT THE OUTSET. AND THE MODELS AND THE DATA WILL BE INVALUABLE TOOLS FOR US TO INFORM THOSE DECISIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I WILL ALSO JUST SAY I SUPPORT THE APPROACH TAKEN HERE OF IDENTIFYING COST SAVINGS AND EFFICIENCIES IS THE FIRST MEANS OF FUNDING THE DESIRED ADDED SERVICES. AND OBVIOUSLY THE SAVINGS ARE DRAMATIC POTENTIALLY. 775,000 ON RESIDENTIAL COLLECTION, 66 # THOUSAND ANNUALLY OPEN COMMERCIAL, SO THAT'S OVER 1.4 MILLION ANNUALLY ON TOTAL COST SAVINGS. SO THAT GOES A VERY LONG WAY TOWARDS FUNDING THE DESIRED NEW SERVICES FOLKS HAVE IDENTIFIED THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE AND THIS SATURDAY AND SUNDAY COLLECTION SERVICES DOWNTOWN THAT ARE OBVIOUSLY NECESSARY TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES. AND YES, WE STRUCTURED THE CONTRACTS TO EXPIRE NEXT JUNE AND WE CAN MAKE A CLEAN BREAK AND TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF THE COSTS. I GUESS I CAN'T HELP BUT MAKE ON THE HEADLEY OVERRIDE RECOMMENDATIONS. I'M NOT SURPRISED TO SEE THAT. SO THIS PROPOSAL TO HAVE A HEADLEY OVERRIDE AND A NEW USER FEE, SOMETHING I WOULD NEVER SUPPORT. NO SURPRISE THERE, I GUESS. MY SUGGESTION WOULD BE THAT BEFORE WE CONSIDER, YOU KNOW, LAYERING ON ANOTHER 5 MILLION IN ANNUAL COSTS FOR OUR RESIDENTS, IT'S 3 MILLION FOR THE OVERRIDE, 2 MILLION FOR THIS NEW FEE, THAT WE GENERATE THE SAVINGS OF THE COLLECTION CONSOLIDATION AND IMPLY THOSE NEW SERVICES. WE BELIEVE OUR PRIORITIES AND FUNDED BY THOSE SAVINGS. SO MY COMMENTS, TWO QUESTIONS AND I WILL SEND THE OTHERS IN. SO ON THIS SLIDE 46, YOU NOTED THAT DESPITE THE 775K -- THANK YOU, CRESSON, IN ANNUAL SAVINGS THERE WAS OPPOSITION. NO -- TO CONSOLIDATING RESIDENTIAL COLLECTION BASED ON PURPPURPORTED ADDED VALUE, QUESTIONING THE VALIDITY OF THE COST SAVING ANALYSIS END QUOTE. SO GIVEN THAT THE CART COLLECTION METHODS ARE THE SAME, IT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME WHAT THAT ADDED VALUE MIGHT BE, AND THE COST SAVINGS CALCULATIONS SEEMED DEVELOP STRAIGHTFORWARD. SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU SPEAK TO THOSE TWO CONCERNS FURTHER? NO?
02:14:59.917: >> City Admin. Lazarus: ANY TIME YOU COMPARE TWO DIFFERENT MEANS OF COLLECTION, THE CHALLENGE IS TO MAKE SURE YOU DO A SIDE-BY-SIDE COMPARISON AND NOT WIND UP WITH SOMETHING YOU QUOTED AS ORANGES TO GRAPEFRUITS ANALYSIS.
02:15:14.465: >> Councilmember Lumm: THAT'S RIGHT.
02:15:15.366: >> City Admin. Lazarus: I THINK WE HAVE DONE A GOOD JOB OF ALIGNING THE COSTS AND SOME OF THE QUESTION IS THE COST OF OVERHEAD AND I WOULD OUR OVERHEAD COSTS ARE NOT LINEAR. IT DOESN'T COST US ANY MORE IN SUPERVISION TO HIRE MORE STAFF THAN WE HAVE NOW. IT DOESN'T COST US ANY MORE TO MANAGE A COUPLE MORE CONTRACTS THAN WE HAVE NOW. SO THERE WAS SOME CONCERN ABOUT THE AL HOECATION OF OVERHEAD AS -- ALLOCATION OF OVERHEAD AS I REMEMBER THE CONVERSATION. SO THAT'S REALLY THE SECOND BULLET. THE FIRST BULLET REALLY DEALT WITH THINGS THAT THE CURRENT PROVIDER HAS STATED THAT THEY DO BEYOND COLLECTION. WHEN WE TALK TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION, THE POINT WAS THAT THE CURRENT CONTRACT IS A COMBINATION OF FIXED PRICE AND FIXED UNIT PRICE. WE DON'T LOOK BEHIND THE CURTAIN AS TO WHERE THAT MONEY GOES. IT'S JUST WHAT WE PAY OUT OPEN THE -- ON THE INJOYCE. INVOICE. SO THERE'S SOME RECOMMENDATION THAT THERE WAS ADDITIONAL VALUE ADDED BY THE PROVIDER, AS OPPOSED TO -- AND IF THAT WAS GONE, IT WOULD MIND UP WITH THE DIMINUTION OF THE RECYCLING PROGRAM. THAT'S THE WAY IT WAS STATED. BUT AS WE SAID, IT'S COLLECTION CONTRACT, AND IT'S THE FIXED PRICE. WE DON'T SEE HOW THE MONEY GOES ONCE WE PAY THE BILL.
02:16:33.544: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANKS, AND LASTLY, AND I WILL SEND IN THE QUESTIONS. SLIDE 50, ABOUT THE RFP. AND YOU SAID THAT THE RESPONSES ARE DUE SEPTEMBER 17th. THE CONTRACT AWARD RECOMMENDATION IS TARGETED FOR OCTOBER 21st. SO I WILL JUST SAY I'M PLEASED WE ARE CONDUCTING A COMPETITIVE BIDDING PROCESS, RATHER THAN SIMPLY AWARDING A LONG-TERM CONTRACT BASED ON AN UNSOLICITED PROPOSAL. CAN YOU VERY QUICKLY -- OR MAYBE NOT SO QUICKLY. CAN YOU PROVIDE SOME INFORMATION ON THE SPECIFIC SCOPE DELIVABLES, SPECIFIED IN THE RFP?
02:17:13.484: >> I COULD PROVIDE A LINK OR THE PDF DOCUMENT.
02:17:17.455: >> Councilmember Lumm: OKAY. AND ALSO DO WE HAVE A SENSE OF AT THIS POINT WHO MAY BE SUBMITTING PROPOSALS?
02:17:24.362: >> City Admin. Lazarus: I DON'T KNOW IF WE SHOULD ANSWER THAT, EVEN IF WE COULD.
02:17:27.631: >> Councilmember Lumm: OKAY.
02:17:28.332: >> City Admin. Lazarus: I WOULD JUST GO BACK AND THERE WAS MEMBERS OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION DID REVIEW THE RFP AND THEY WERE INVOLVED IN THAT PROCESS.
02:17:38.209: >> YEP.
02:17:38.609: >> Councilmember Lumm: BUT, AGAIN, IF YOU COULD PROVIDE US THE LINK, THAT WOULD BE GREAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
02:17:43.381: >> ACTUALLY, I WILL STILL FORWARD IT AND B WORK IT. BUT ON THE PURCHASING WEBSITE, AND THE RFPs.
02:17:55.760: >> Councilmember Lumm: I WANT SOME GENERATION ABOUT THE SCOPE AN THE DELIVERABLES AND THE DURATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
02:18:02.833: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
02:18:03.701: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION. I KNOW IT'S GONE LONG AND THERE IS PUBLIC THAT WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT TOO. JUST ON LIKE SLIDE 35 AS WE LOOK AT THE COMMODITIES RECORD FOR RECYCLING. I WOULD JUST WISH THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING WITH MORE TIME, A FIVE-YEAR TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, IT'S A RATHER SHORT GLIMPSE IN TIME TO SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN WITH THE COMMODITIES MARKET, YOU KNOW, WHAT DOES HAPPEN OVER FIVE OR TEN YEARS. I KNOW THERE'S -- THIS IS PROBABLY HOPEFULLY A LOW POINT AS STATES AND REGIONS DO A LITTLE BIT MORE HOME GROWN PROCESSING AND RECYCLING FOR A SECONDARY MARKET. IF I WAS AN INVESTOR, I WOULD BET THAT THAT LINE IS GOING UP, HOPEFULLY SOON. SO I WOULD JUST SAY THAT THAT'S KIND OF A SHORT TIME FRAME TO BE LOOKING AT SOMETHING AS A GLOBAL MARKET. BUT I DIGRESS. SECONDLY, I WANT TO GO ON ABOUT THE EDUCATION ASPECTS. THERE'S COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH STAFF' PROPOSAL OF ROUGHLY $300,000 IN OUTREACH AND EDUCATION. IS THAT JUST TIED TO WASTE OR IS THAT RECYCLING? IS -- ARE WE GOING TO GET A COMPONENT OF RECYCLING ANN ARBOR WAS AWARDED, LET'S SAY THE CONTRACT FOR MUCH HIGHER PRICE, ARE WE LOOKING AT SOME OF THOSE COSTS, PART OF WHAT THEY DO FOR THE ADDITIONAL FEES THEY ASK FOR? IS THAT EDUCATION PART OF IT?
02:19:47.771: >> SO, FIRST, COUNCILMEMBER, THIS IS THE SLIDE AND THE COSTS THAT YOU ARE REFERRING TO.
02:19:52.176: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: CORRECT.
02:19:53.344: >> WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I'M REFERENCING THE RIGHT. WHAT THESE COSTS REPRESENT, THIS IS STILL IN TERMS OF EDUCATION AND OUTREACH SPECIFICALLY. WE DO HAVE SOME CONTRACTS WITH THE ECOLOGY CENTER, DIFFERENT ENTITY. THOSE CONTRACTS STILL REMAIN IN PLACE, SIMILAR TO, I FORGET WHICH ASPECT MOLLY MENTIONED, BUT THESE ARE ADDITIONAL ITEMS TO FURTHER AUGMENT AND MOVE US FORWARD. SO THESE COSTS HERE ARE ACTUALLY STAFFING COSTS IN THE FIRST FOR THAT NEW POSITION. THE SECOND WOULD BE A COST TO SPECIFICALLY BRING IN AN OUTSIDE MARKETING ADVERTISING COMPANY TO HELP US AND DEVELOP THAT CAMPAIGN AND MATERIAL. SO THOSE ARE SPECIFIC COSTS TO THAT. BUT THOSE EDUCATION OUTREACH ITEMS THAT THE ECOLOGY CENTER DOES AS A SPECIFIC CONTRACT ARE STILL IN PLACE IN THERE. BUT AS FAR AS I UNDERSTOOD THE QUESTION RIGHT, THOSE -- ANY EDUCATIONAL ITEMS IN THE RECYCLE ANN ARBOR AND THE COLLECTION CONTRACT IS IT --
02:20:53.737: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES.
02:20:55.306: >> JEAGAIN, WHAT BACK TO ADMINISTRATOR LAZARUS' POINT, WHATEVER THEY MAY BE, THEY ARE IN THE OTHER CONTRACT. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THOSE MAY BE, WHAT THOSE ARE, IF THEY ARE THERE, AND SO THOSE ARE TIED TO THAT OTHER CONTRACT.
02:21:17.061: >> TO BE MORE BLUNT, WE ARE NOT CONTRACTING WITH RECYCLE ANN ARBOR FOR ANY OF THOSE EDUCATIONAL SERVICES. OUR CONTRACT IS FOR COLLECTION.
02:21:25.369: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: OKAY. AND THEN ON THE BULKY ITEM PICKUP IS THAT A FEE-BASED SERVICE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT IT?
02:21:36.814: >> YES.
02:21:37.081: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  SO THAT ADDS ON -- WE TALK ABOUT SUNDAY PICKUPS IN THE ALLEYS. WE TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE ORGANIC COLLECTION AND ALL OF THESE SERVICES. THESE ARE ALL FEE BASED.
02:21:48.892: >> YES. SO POINT OF CLARIFICATION AND MOLLY HIT IT, BUT, WHAT IS LISTED ON THE SLIDES ARE THE COSTS TO IMPLEMENT THOSE ITEMS BUT THOSE THAT COULD HAVE SERVICES THAT ARE TO SPECIFIC PARTIES, SO TO TAKE THE BULKY WASTE AS A GOOD EXAMPLE, THAT WOULD NOT BE A PROGRAM WE WOULD SPREAD ACROSS THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY AND EVERYBODY WOULD PAY FOR, BECAUSE NOT EVERYBODY WILL USE IT. THAT WILL BE A FOR-FEE SERVICE AND WE WOULD LOOK TO RECOVER THAT COST AND THEN HAVE IT BE A NET ZERO THROUGH THOSE FEES.
02:22:25.396: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: OKAY. THANK YOU WILL.
02:22:27.865: >> City Admin. Lazarus: CRESSON, ON THE COST FOR OUTREACH, THAT WAS BASED ON COMPARISON TO HIGH PERFORMING PEER CITIES AND SOME OF THE PROGRAMS THAT THEY HAVE AND BECAUSE OF THOSE PROGRAMS, YOU ARE ABLE TO INCREASE THEIR DIVERSION RATES.
02:22:41.145: >> YES.
02:22:41.412: >> City Admin. Lazarus: IF YOU CAN CONFIRM THAT.
02:22:42.579: >> AND PARTICULARLY, REALLY THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS CAME FROM, THAT AND WHAT STICKS IN MY MIND IN PARTICULAR, THE GRASS ROOTS OUTREACH, TV SAN FRANCISCO, IN PARTICULAR, THOSE WERE THE ONES THAT WERE THEIR METHOD TO DO THAT, WHERE THEY WERE DOWN TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD LEVEL THROUGH THE ORGANIZATION TO DO THAT.
02:23:08.205: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER QUESTIONS? DISCUSSION? BTHANK YOU. WE NOW COME TO PUBLIC COMMENT GENERAL TIME. PUBLIC COMMENT GENERAL TIME IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO SPEAK TO COUNCIL AND THE COMMUNITY ABOUT MATTERS OF MUNICIPAL INTEREST. TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT GENERAL TIME, ONE NEED NOT HAVE SIGNED UP IN ADVANCE. SPEAKERS HAVE THREE MINUTES IN WHICH TO SPEAK. SO PLEASE PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE TIME CLOCK. AS A MATTER OF COURTESY, WE MAY ONLY HAVE ONE PERSON SPEAKING AT' TIME. AND IF YOU REQUIRE ASSISTANCE IN SPEAKING BEFORE COUNCIL, WE WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO PROVIDE IT TO YOU. IS THIS ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT. THERE'S NO NEED TO RAISE YOUR HAND. JUST QUEUE UP.
02:24:01.725: >> GOOD EVENING. I'M NANCY STONE. I LIVE IN THE FIFTH WARD AND FOR 23 YEARS I SERVED YOU AS SOLID %-úR THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. AND I CURRENTLY VOLUNTEER WITH THE WASHTENAW SOLID WASTE PLAN IMPLEMENTATION COMMITTEE. TODAY, I'M SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE SEVERAL REPRESENTATIVES FROM ORGANIZATIONS AND BUSINESSES WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE RECENT SOLID WASTE PLAN UPDATE PROCESS. WE EMAILED YOU A LETTER AND WE OUTLINED SEVERAL CONCERNS IN THE DRAFT PLAN AND LET US LOOK AT JUST ONE ITEM, AND THIS IS ONE THAT JANE ASKED ABOUT. OUR PRIMARY CONCERN IS THE IDEA THAT THE CITY CAN SAVE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF MONEY BY DIVIDING THE CITY'S TRASH, RECYCLING, AND COMPOSTING PICKUPS BETWEEN JUST TWO PROVIDERS. ONE FOR ALL RESIDENTIAL AND THE OTHER FOR ALL COMMERCIAL ROADS. THE DRIVING ASSUMPTION HERE IS THAT RECYCLING AND TRASH COLLECTIONS WILL BE PAYING AND COST THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY IN THE FUTURE, AND THIS IS NOT ACCURATE BECAUSE WE NEED TO LOOK AT HOW RECYCLING COLLECTION IS INTRINSICALLY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT GOES ON FOR SOLID WASTE COLLECTION. ATONAL SIS DOES NOT TAKE INTO BEING THAT NEARLY HALF OF -- THE ANALYSIS DOES NOT TAKE THATLY HALF OF COLLECTIONS ARE MULTIFAMILY OR MIXED BUSINESS AREAS. SO MOST LARGE COMPLEXES, APARTMENTS, CONDOMINIUMS AND BUSINESSES USE SEVERAL SCATTERED WOODEN ENCLOSURES TO HOLE HOLD MULTIPLE RECYCLING CARTS. THEY HAVE TO GO TO THE DRIVER. THEY MOVE MANY CARTS FROM CORRALS AND THAT TAKES MUCH MORE TIME THAN THE CITY'S REFUSE COLLECTION WHICH IS MOSTLY AUTOMATED AS WE ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE CURBSIDE CARTS THAT ARE SIDE LOADED OR THE TRASH DUMPSTERS THAT ARE FRONT LOAD. LeCYCLE ANN ARBOR DRIVERS ALSO TAKE TIME TO LEAVE INFORMATIONAL TAGS WHEN THEY SEE CONTAMINATION, AND THIS IMPROVES THE QUALITY AND THE VALUE OF THE CITY'S RECYCLABLES. WHAT MIGHT BE OUT OF COMPLIANCE IS CIRCLE HERE AND THE FULL INFORMATION IS GIVEN ON THE OTHER SIDE. SO TO SOME, IT'S CRITICAL TO EVALUATE FUTURE CONTRACTS FOR RECYCLING COLLECTION COSTS, BY USING AN EASY TRANSPARENT APPROACH. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS, PLEASE DIRECT CITY STAFF TO ISSUE COLLECTION RFPs THAT REQUIRE A BREAKDOWN FOR COLLECTION COSTS IN DETAIL BOTH FOR THE RESIDENTIAL AND BUSINESS SECTORS BY ALL POLITICS. THIS WAY, YOU CITY COUNCIL, CITY STAFF AND THE PUBLIC WILL BE ABLE TO CLEARLY COMPARE THE COST AND SERVICE LEVELS AND MAKE THE BEST DECISIONS FOR OUR COMMUNITY. THANK YOU.
02:27:00.737: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
02:27:12.115: >> SANDRA ANDRATT RYE FROM THE MAIN STREET ASSOCIATION. I'M REALLY REITEM COLLECTION ERR -- REITERATING. WE SENT A LETTER TO Y'ALL THIS MORNING THAT I HOPE YOU TAKE THE TIME TO READ. THE BIG THING IS THAT WE FEEL STRONGLY THAT WE NEED MORE STAKE IN WHAT -- WHAT GOES ON MOVING FORWARD WITH THE DOWNTOWN. SERVICE ON SUNDAY IS NOT A NEW THING WE HAVE BEEN ASKING FOR. THAT NEEDED TO HAPPEN A LONG TIME AGO. SO -- AND THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS IN THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE AGREE WITH. WE KNOW THAT THEY WANT TO GET THERE. WE KNOW THAT ENFORCEMENT NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED. THE CITY IS ON THE SAME PAGE BUT WE REALLY NEED TO BE AT THE TABLE MAKING THESE DECISIONS MOVING FORWARD. BECAUSE IT'S BEEN A STRUGGLE. ANYWAY, I WANTED TO REITERATE THAT. THANK YOU.
02:28:01.031: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
02:28:17.314: >> THANK YOU. MY NAME IS NANCY SHIFLER. I LIVE HERE IN ANN ARBOR. AS THE CITY IS CONSIDERING THE PLAN FOR MANAGING SOLID WASTE, IT REALLY NEEDS TO KEEP IN MIND WHAT WE'RE DOING THIS FOR. WE HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF SUSTAINABILITY GOALS IN THE CITY, LONG-TERM INTEREST IN ZERO WASTE CULTURE, AND WHILE THE NEW PROPOSAL PLAN -- THE PROPOSED PLAN INCLUDES A NUMBER OF RECOMMENDATIONS, I THINK THERE'S SOME THAT ACTUALLY RUN COUNTER TO THOSE BROADER GOALS AND ONE OF THE WAYS WE SHOULD BE ASSESSING THE -- THE PROPOSED RECOMMENDATIONS IN TERMS OF ARE THEY REALLY GETTING US TOWARDS THOSE SUSTAINABILITY GOALS? JUST SOME EXAMPLES, THE -- DIVIDING THE COLLECTION INTO SERVICE SECTOR, SEPARATELY FOR RECYCLABLES AND -- OR COMBINING EVERYTHING IN RESIDENTIAL AND EVERYTHING IN COMMERCIAL, WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT THAT VALUE STREAM PROCESS TO THE EXTENT THAT IT IMPROVES ON THE QUALITY OF WHAT WE RECYCLE. AND THE MARKETABILITY OF IT, BECAUSE IF IT'S -- IF IT'S NOT DOING THE BEST JOB IT CAN ON THAT, THEN WHERE ARE WE WITH SUSTAINABILITY. ALSO THE PLAN IS RECOMMENDING FUNDING NEW CONTRACTS FOR MARKETING THE PROGRAMS. RATHER THAN LOOKING, I THINK MORE CAREFULLY AT THE-THE-SETS THAT WE ALREADY HAVE THAT ARE ABLE TO DO THAT MARKETING. NOT JUST RECYCLE ANN ARBOR. THERE ARE OTHER ENTITIES IN TOWN FROM SCRAP BOX TO THE SALVATION ARMY AND WHATEVER ELSE, AND PULLING THOSE TO GO, I THINK IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR. THE PLAN ALSO PAYS KIND OF MINIMAL ATTENTION TO REDEVELOPING THE MRF AS JUST SORT OF ONE POSSIBLE ITEM AND I THINK WE ARE LOSING OUT ON THE LOCAL CONTROL OVER THE QUALITY OF WHAT WE ARE PUTTING INTO RECYCLING. SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAINTAIN THAT. AND THEN THE PLANS PROPOSED WASTE DIVERSION FEE, ALL THAT IS DOING IS DISCOURAGING DIVERTING WASTE AND WHAT WE SHOULD BE IS ENCOURAGING DOING THAT. SO PLACING A FEE ON THE WASTE DIVERSION PROCESS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE FOR THE LONG-TERM GOALS. SO AS YOU REVIEW THE PLAN, I ENCOURAGE YOU TO EVALUATE IT THROUGH THE LENS OF OUR SUSTAINABILITY GOALS. THANK YOU.
02:31:13.423: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
02:31:22.999: >> GOOD EVENING. I'M PHIL TEPLEY, THE DIRECTOR OF TECHNOLOGY, COMMERCIALIZATION AND GROWTH SERVICES AT MICHIGAN SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CENTER AND I'M ALSO A 15-YEAR BOARD MEMBER AT RECYCLE ANN ARBOR. I'M SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF RAA TONIGHT, SUMMARIZING A LETTER WE WOULD LIKE TO SHARE FROM OUR BOARD CHAIR, ERIC HEAD WHO IS UNFORTUNATELY OUT OF TOWN TONIGHT. WE BELIEVE THAT THE SOLID WASTE RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PLAN FINANCIAL ANALYSIS INACCURATELY INFLATES THE RELATIVE COSTS OF RECYCLE ANN ARBOR'S CURBSIDE COLLECTION SERVICES. WE ASSERT THAT A CORRECT ANALYSIS WOULD CONCLUDE THAT INSOURCING THE CURBSIDE COLLECTION SERVICES WOULD SAVE THE CITY VERY LITTLE, IF ANY MONEY. I WOULD LIKE TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT AND REFER YOU TO ERR'S LETTER, WHICH I WILL PASS OUT FOR MORE SPECIFIC DETAIL. FIRST OF ALL, THE CITY -- OR THE ANALYSIS NEGLECTS SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL EXPENSES OF SERVICING AS SOMEONE HAD MENTIONED, THAT NANCY HAS MENTIONED, MULTIFAMILY AND THE COMMERCIAL LOCATIONS. THE CURRENT RAA, THE CURRENT SERVICE WE COLLECT FROM OVER 2500 LOCATIONS EACH WEEK, AND THE COST OF COLLECTING THESES IS FAR MORE EXPENSIVE THAN SINGLE FAMILY SITES AND THE CONSOLIDATION SCENARIO DID NOT TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT. FURTHER, MOST OF THESE SITES HAVE MULTIPLE CARTS, JUST SHY OF 7400 IN TOTAL AND MOST OF THESE ARE SEMIAUTOMATED MEANING THE DRIVER HAS TO GET OUT OF THE TRUCK TO TIP THE CART TO CREATE A HIGHER LABOR COST PER STOP. SECOND, THE ANALYSIS NEGLECTS SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL MANAGEMENT AND EDUCATION EXPENSES THAT ARE CURRENTLY PERFORMED BY RAA AND THEY ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATION SCENARIO. ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS INCLUDING DATA TRACKING, REPORT, DRIVER SUPERVISION AND DISPATCH AND MORE YOU INCLUDED IN THE RAA COST. RAA'S COLLECTION COST ALSO INCLUDE, THE ON THE GROUND OUTREACH, SOME OF WHICH IS REQUIRED BY THE CONTRACT AND HAS HELPED TO KEEP THE QUALITY OF THE RECYCLABLE HIGHS AND THIS COMPARES THE ANALYSIS WITH NEW VEHICLES VERSUS RAA'S CURRENT OPERATIONS WITHOUT THOSE VEHICLES. THE REPORT ASSUMES THAT OTHER THAN FOR STANDARD ESCALATOR OR COSTS WOULD REMAIN UNCHANGED NOT FUTURE CONTRACT BUT RAA WOULD INVEST IN NEW TRUCKS ANTEING NOLLS AND THESE INVESTMENTS WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER FUTURE COLLECTION COSTS. RECYCLE ANN ARBOR IS A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION. OUR BOARD MEMBERS VOLUNTEER OUR TIME TO ADVANCE THE MISSION, TO PROMOTE A CIRCULAR ECONOMY. IF RAA WERE TRULY COSTLY, AS COSTLY AS BEING PORTRAYED WE WOULD NOT EVEN ARGUE THIS CASE. IT WOULD FLY IN THE FACE OF OUR MIG. MISSION. FRANKLY, IT'S TO SEEK COMPETITIVE BIDS FOR THAT SERVICE. WE WOULD WELCOME ANY TRANSPARENT BIDDING PROCESS THAT COMPARED ACTUAL COSTS AND WE BELIEVE THAT SUCH A PROCESS WOULD REVEAL OUR OPERATIONS ARE BOTH COST EFFECTIVE AND MISSION EFFECTIVE. THANK YOU.
02:34:24.447: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. TO THE CLERK. SHE WILL DISTRIBUTE.
02:34:35.525: >> HI. MY NAME IS KERRY HIGGINS. I'M HERE REPRESENTING WELL-INTENTIONED PEOPLE, SPECIFICALLY THE PEOPLE ON THE INTERFAITH COUNCIL FOR PEACE AND JUSTICE, ICPJ. SO WITH RESPECT TO THE DRAFTED SOLID WASTE PLAN, YOU KNOW, WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE INCLUSION OF YEAR-ROUND RESIDENTIAL COMPOSTING IN THE PLAN. THIS IS ESSENTIAL. THIS IS AN AREA WHICH ICPJ HAS BEEN DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN AND SEES AS A SIGNIFICANT STEP FORWARD FOR THE CITY. WE HOPE THAT MULTIFAMILY RESIDENTS AND COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISES WILL SOON HAVE ACCESS TO FOOD WASTE COMPOSTING AS WELL, OF COURSE THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT. WE ARE PARTICULARLY CONCERNED ABOUT RECYCLING. Y 50CPJ WAS INVOLVED IN THE INITIATION OF ANN ARBOR'S RECYCLING PROGRAM AND WHEN THE BALLOT CAMPAIGN TO FUND AND BUILD THE MRF TOOK PLACE. RECYCLING IS A LOW HANGING FRUIT TO TANGIBLE WAYS TO REDUCE EMISSIONS. ANN ARBOR HAS AN IMPRESSIVE RECYCLING PROGRAM THAT HAS PROVEN TO RECYCLE EFFECTIVELY, REGARDING THE RECENT CHALLENGES FOR RECYCLERS. IT PROVIDES CONTINUING EDUCATION, CRUCIAL TO MAKING THE PROCESS WORK, ALONG WITH OFFERING SERVICES SUCH AS THE DROPOFF STATION, WHERE YOU CAN RECYCLE MATERIALS, INCLUDE STYROFOAM, BUT, YES, THIS ALREADY IMPLEMENTS THE SERVICE NEEDS, WORK AND ATTENTION WHICH WE WOULD EXPECT THE SOLID WASTE PLAN TO ADDRESS. IT APPEARS TO US THAT THE PLAN HAS PRESENTED WOULD LIKELY DO SERIOUS DAMAGE OR PHASE OUT RECYCLE ANN ARBOR WHICH WE THINK WOULD BE A MAJOR LOSS AND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF RECYCLING IN ANN ARBOR. IT'S TAKEN DEDICATION TO KEEP THE WASTE STREAM CLEAN AND FIND MARKET FOR MATERIALS, YOU NAME IT. IT'S NOT JUST TRASH COLLECTION AND DISPOSAL. RECYCLE ANN ARBOR IS A NAME WELL-KNOWN AND VALUED IN THE COMMUNITY FOR THE DEDICATION FOR PROPER RECYCLING. THE PLAN ALSO LISTS MAJOR COST SAVINGS, YOU KNOW AS MENTIONED, THERE'S CONCERNS OF SIGNIFICANT -- SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS OF HOW THIS FIGURE WAS DETERMINED AND CONCERNS OF ACCURACY. IF IS A FINANCIAL DIFFERENCE, WE BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER E REPLACEMENT HAULER PROVIDES THE SAME COMMUNITY VALUE AND QUALITY FOR THE COSTS AT HAND. AS A SEPARATE RELATED ISSUE, REDEVELOPMENT OF THE MRF BY A GROUP THAT'S DEDICATED TO RECYCLING WOULD SAVE THE CITY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS NOT TO MENTION THE GREEN HOUSE GASES. YOU KNOW, SOUTHERN OHIO, AS MENTIONED. AS YOU MAY KNOW, RECYCLING ANN ARBOR HAS DEVELOPED A PROPOSAL TO DO THIS WITH EXTERNAL FUNDING. WE WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONSIDER AS IT SEEMS UNLIKELY THAT THE CITY OR THE COUNTY WILL RESPOND IN THE NEEDED TIMELY MANNER. MONEY IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT ANN ARBOR'S WASTE, WE HOPE YOU WILL MAKE THE CITY'S COMMITMENT TO A HEALTHY CLIMATE AND EQUALLY PRIORITY WE CAN COMPOST AS MUCH OF OUR WASTE AS POSSIBLE. THANK YOU.
02:37:36.239: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
02:37:46.449: >> HI, I'M DAN EZEKIEL. I'M REPRESENTING THE SIERRA CLUB HURON VALLEY GROUP. THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. MY DAD WAS ON ANN ARBOR CITY COUNCIL. SO I UNDER SOMETHING OF THE TIME AND THE DEDICATION THAT IT TAKES FOR YOU TO REPRESENT US WELL. ANN ARBOR WAS LONG A LEADER IN INNOVATIVE MISSION-DRIVEN DIVERSION OF WASTE FROM THE LANDFILL, WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH COMMUNITY-BASED NONPROFITS LIKE RECYCLE ANN ARBOR. WE TOOK OUR EYE OFF THE BALL A LITTLE AND WE HAVEN'T KEPT UP WITH THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT EXIST IN TODAY'S WORLD OR THE CHALLENGES. WE HAVE HAD A COUPLE OF HUGE PRESIDEPROBLEMS CREATED BY MISMANAGEMENT OF THE ANN ARBOR'S SOLID WASTE COLLECTION, THE DOWNTOWN TRASH COLLECTION AND THE MRF, THE SWRMP, BARELY ADDRESSED THESE IMPORTANT ISSUES AND YET IT PROPOSES BIG CHANGES TO THE PAR PART OF OUR SYSTEM TT RUNS WELL AND SUPPORTED BY OVER 90% OF THE COMMUNITY. WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE LEADERSHIP AGAIN AND HERE ARE THREE WAYS. FIRST OF ALL, THE HURON VALLEY GROUP HAS ALREADY ASKED COUNCIL TO PASA PHRASE THE GOVERNOR TO FIX THE DAMN MRF, EITHER THROUGH I.A.A.s AT NO COST TO THE CITY. SO THAT SOUNDS LIKE THAT MAY BE GOING FORWARD. WE ASKED COUNCIL TO JOIN THE COUNTY'S REGIONAL WASTE AUTHORITY WITHOUT ANY MORE DELAY AND WORK WITH THE NEIGHBORS ON REPAIRING OR REPLACING THE DDROPOFFSTATION WHERE IT FALLS O ANYTHING AND DISINVESTMENT. AND WE WOULD LIKE UP COULD SILL TO STEP IN ASSERTIVELY, INCLUDING NOT ACCEPTING THIS REPORT. THERE ARE SOME PARTS THAT ARE ACCEPTABLE, BUT AS A WHOLE, IT'S NOT OKAY. WE SHOULD THANK APTOM LEN LET THEM GO ON THEIR WAY AND REJECT THE COLLECTIONS AS PROPOSED, INSTEAD DIRECT STAFF TO EXPLORE CONSOLIDATING SERVICE BY MATERIAL STREAM. APTOM, IT'S PART OF A LARGE CONSULTING FIRM, PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY. LIKE MANY CORPORATE WASTE PLAYERS THEY SEE RECYCLABLES AS BEING LIKE TRASH AND ANOTHER DUMPSTER TO GET RID OF. RECYCLING IS THE PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED. THIS IS THE SAME TYPE OF THINKING THAT HELPED TO DEGRADE THE U.S. RECYCLING STREAMS SO MUCH THAT THE CHINESE TOLD US TO STOP SENDING OUR SO-CALLED RECYCLABLES. ANN ARBORRITES SEE RECYCLABLES ALZE A RESOURCE AND WASTING RESOURCES AND THROWING THEM IN THE LANDFILLS IS A PROBLEM. THIS REPORT SEEMS TO BE STRAIGHT OFF THE RACK BEING THE SAME -- THE SAME REPORT THAT THEY WOULD HAVE MADE FOR ASHTABULA. SO WE WOULD LIKE YOU TO -- WE WOULD LIKE YOU TO TAKE A CLOSE LOOK AT ALL THE ASSUMPTIONS HERE. THANK YOU.
02:40:31.614: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
02:40:43.626: >> GOOD EVENING, EVERYBODY. THANKS FOR THE TIME. I'M ACTUALLY NOT HERE TO TALK ABOUT WASTE. I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF KEN BRYANT WOULD IS THERE IN THE BACK AND HE IS A MEDICAL MARIJUANA PROVISIONING CENTER OWN HERE HERE IN ANN ARBOR. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPENED WHEN THE ORDINANCE WAS PASSED IS WITH THE 28 SEUs IT CREATED 28 LOTTERY TICKETS AND ONE OF THE TINGS THAT HAPPENED TO  HIM, HIS BUILDING OWNER REALIZED THAT HIS BUILDING IS WORTH A LOT MORE MONEY AND SQUEEZED HIM OUT. I'M NOT HERE TO ASK FOR THE 29th SEU, BUT WHAT I WOULD LIKE YOU TO CONSIDER IS THE PEOPLE WHO ARE MOVING THROUGH THE QUEUE RIGHT NOW, I COUNT 26 PERPERMITS ISSUED WITH TWO OUT UNDER REVIEW. THE FIRST ONE HAS BEEN UNDER REVIEW FOR OVER A YEAR. IT'S BEEN KICKED OUT OF PLANNING THREE TIMES. THE SECOND ONE IT'S TAKEN 15 MONTHS. IT'S NOT BEEN ISSUED AND ON MAY 19th. IT WAS WRITTEN A LETTER OF NO ACTIVITY MEMO AND HAS YET NO RESPOND. THANKS TO YOUR WONDERFUL ONLINE SYSTEM, YOU CAN KIND OF TRACK THESE. SO WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU TO POTENTIALLY DO IS MAYBE SET SOME SORT OF MECHANISM FOR A TIME FRAME FOR HOW LONG THAT THESE PERMITS CAN GO BEFORE, YOU KNOW, SOMEBODY ELSE IN THE QUEUE CAN GET A CHANCE. I'M ASKING THIS, BECAUSE KEN, HE HAPPENS TO BE NEXT IN THE QUEUE, AND IS READY TO GO, AND BY ALL ACCOUNTS, OF THE 26 THAT HAVE BEEN ISSUED, THEY TAKE BETWEEN FIVE AND SEVEN MONTHS NORMALLY TO BE ISSUED. SO OVER A YEAR AND 15 MONTHS SEEMS A LITTLE BIT EXCESSIVE. SO IF YOU COULD MAYBE PUSH THESE TWO FORWARD OR KICK THEM OUT FOR ANOTHER PERSON TO MAYBE GET A CHANCE, OR JUST CONSIDER SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES, THAT WOULD BE GREAT. SO APPRECIATE THE TIME. EVERYBODY HAVE A GOOD EVENING.
02:42:35.471: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
02:42:43.613: >> GOOD EVENING. MY NAME IS KAREN PRAGNOW, I'M AN ENVIRONMENTAL CONSULTANT AND A ANN ARBOR RESIDENT AND A MOM. I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT THE MRF AND GETTING IT UP AND RUNNING AGAIN. I THINK IT GOES A LONG WAY TO DECREASING OUR EDUCATIONAL COSTS FOR RECYCLING IN THE COMMUNITY. WE CAN RUN SCHOOL GROUPS THROUGH THERE AGAIN AND REALLY DO A GOOD JOB OF EDUCATING OR POPULOUS AND THE GOOTGET OUR RECYCLING STREAF BETTER QUALITY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME.
02:43:18.114: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
02:43:23.286: >> GOOD EVENING, I'M IAN ROBINSON. RESIDENT, WARD 4, PRESIDENT OF HURON AREA LABOR FEDERATION AND I WOULD LIKE TO LOOK AT THIS FROM MORE OF A LABOR PERSPECTIVE. OF COURSE, THIS IS ENVIRONMENTAL WORK, BUT THERE'S ALWAYS A LABOR DIMENSION TO EVERYTHING THAT WE DO AND PARTICULARLY AS A PUBLIC ENTITY, I THINK WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO DO OUR PART TO REVERSE THE TRENDS OF PRIVATIZATION AND CONTRACTING OUT AND GOING WITH NONUNION LABOR THAT HAVE CUMULATIVELY GENERATED THE GROW HING ECONOMIC DISPARITIES IN OUR COUNTRY. WE CAN TRY TO PUT PRESSURE ON PRIVATE CORPORATIONS TO DO THAT SORT OF THING AND WE DO, BUT WE NEED TO HAVE OUR PUBLIC ENTERS AND THE ELECTED OFFICIALS WHO WE PUT IN POWER IN ORDER TO MAKE DECISIONS ON BEHALF OF THOSE PLAY THEIR PART IN THIS AS WELL. THE PROPOSAL THAT'S BEING PUT FORWARD BY THE ADMINISTRATION, WOULD TAKE A SYSTEM WHICH HAS THREE ENTITIES, TWO OF WHICH HAVE UNIONIZED WORKFORCES, ELIMINATE ONE OF NOSE TWO UNIONIZED WORKFORCES BY COMPLETELY TAKING RECYCLE ANN ARBOR OUT OF THE PICTURE AND PROBABLY REPLACE IT WITH WASTE MANAGEMENT OR AN ENTITY LIKE WASTE MANAGEMENT THAT VERY LEEKLY HAS NO UNION WORKFORCE. AND IF IT IS WASTE MANAGEMENT, HAS A LONG AND WELL-DESERVED REPUTATION AS AN ANTILABOR ORGANIZATION. THAT SPENDS MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO FIGHT UNIONIZATION AND TO FIGHT THE ACTUAL REALIZATION PROTECTION OF WORKERS RIGHTS. SO I THINK THIS ENTITY NEEDS TO LOOK AT AN ALTERNATIVE PROPOSAL THAT'S BEEN DEVELOPED BY LABOR AND BY ENVIRONMENTAL PEOPLE. SOME OF WHICH HAS ALREADY BEEN SPOKEN TO. IT WOULD -- INSTEAD OF DIVIDING THE STREAMS AND THE WAY THAT HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED BY THE PRESENTERS OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL, INSTEAD, IT WOULD CONCENTRATE ALL RECYCLING IN THE RECYCLE ANN ARBOR UNDER THEIR UMBRELLA AND ALL NON-RECYCLING, ALL SOLID WASTE UNDER THE CITY AS MOST OF IT CURRENTLY IS. THAT WOULD ENSURE THAT WE HAVE THE SIMPLIFICATION. WE HAVE TWO QUITE DIFFERENT WASTE STREAMS. ONE ENTITY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR EACH. THAT'S AN EFFICIENCY IN THE SENTENCE OF GETTING RID OF ONE OF THE THREE ENTITIES THAT ARE CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN THIS SYSTEM. IT GUARANTEES THAT THE WORK WILL BE DONE BY ORGANIZED LABOR, BY PEOPLE WHO ARE REPRESENTED BY LABOR AND PAID A DECENT UNION PAGE. AND I THINK -- WAGE. AND I THINK WE SHOULD DO THIS AT THE CITY LEVEL FIRST AND THEN ONCE WE HAVE A MODEL IN THIS WAY, SEE IF WE CAN'T GENERALIZE IT TO THE REST THE COUNTY RATHER THAN ENTERING INTO A REGIONAL BODY ON WHICH WE WILL BE OUT VOTED ON MATTERS SUCH AS SHOULD WE EMPLOY UNION LABOR? MAYBE IT WILL COST A LITTLE BIT MORE. MAYBE THAT'S WHAT IT TAK TAKES O CREATE A JUST SOCIETY WHERE WE PAY A LITTLE BIT MORE. I DON'T WANT MOST OF THE VOTES REPRESENTED BY ANN ARBOR AND REPRESENTED BY ONE VOTE AT THE STABLE. AND I DON'T THINK CRESSON'S RESPONSIBLE. I DON'T KNOW WHY THE THING WENT OFF JUST AS I MENTIONED YOU, KRIS. BUT, YES, WE CAN THREATEN TO WITHDRAW, YES, WE CAN THREATEN TO SAY WE WOULDN'T SIGN A CONTRACT BUT WHY DON'T WE STAND FOR THE PRINCIPAL OF DEMOCRACY AND GO UP AND SET UP THAT DARNED ORGANIZATION IN THAT SPIRIT.
02:46:45.654: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT?
02:46:55.030: >> GOOD EVENING. ERIC LIPSOME, I'M A FOURTH WARD RESIDENT AND 21 YEARS AGO, I WAS THE SECOND REUSE MANAGER AT RECYCLE ANN ARBOR. DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME, WE WENT FROM $150 A DAY REVENUE TO 1,000 A DAY REVENUE OVER A PERIOD OF TWO YEARS. RECYCLE ANN ARBOR IS ONE OF THE FOREMOST RECYCLING ORGANIZATIONS IN THE NATION. EVERYONE GIVES A LOT OF LIP SERVICE AND I'M SURE ALL OF THE PEOPLE ON THIS CITY COUNCIL DO TOO. YOU KNOW THE EXPRESSION BUY LOCAL OR BUY, BUY LOCAL. IF WE DON'T SUPPORT OUR LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS, WHICH HAVE BEEN DOING THE JOB FOR 40 YEARS WITHOUT A HITCH, WHAT GOOD ARE WE AS PEOPLE? WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE -- THIS IS -- WHO ARE -- HAVE BEEN WORKING FOR RECYCLE FOR 20 YAO ERRS. I TALKED JUST TO BRIAN THE DIRECTOR RECYCLE WHO RETURNED MY CALL. HE DIDN'T KNOW WHO I WAS. ONE OF THE THINGS WHEN I SAID VENTURE CAPITALISTS, WHEN THEY ARE LOOKING AT WOULD TO BET ON THE IDEA IS 20% AND THE PEOPLE THAT CARRY IT OUT ARE 80%. YOU RECYCLE ANN ARBOR HAS AS -- WHEN BRIAN SAID TO ME WHEN I WAS TALKING TO HIM, HE SAID, WE HAVE A DEEP BENCH. AND THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S WHAT THEY DO. ZERO WASTE, CIRCULAR ECONOMY, UNION LABOR, LOCAL, FAIR WAGE JOBS. APTOM, AS MR. EZEKIEL POINTED OUT WAS, I BELIEVE, THE HIGH BIDDER FOR SOME WHERE REASON WAN THIS CONSULTING -- THIS HIGH-PRICED CONSULTING JOB. I THINK IT'S A WORK OF FICTION I'M AFRAID. YOU KNOW, THE -- IT IS SO COMPLICATED AND ALL OF THE CRITICISMS THAT WE HAVE HEARD, TO ME, OF THE ANALYSIS ARE VALID. WHO ARE YOU GOING TO BET ON? IF THIS WAS YOUR MONEY -- AND IT IS YOUR MONEY -- WHO ARE YOU GOING TO BET ON? ARE YOU GOING TO BET O
