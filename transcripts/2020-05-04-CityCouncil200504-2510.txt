[CHORUS OF AYES] ALL OPPOSED? THE AGENDA IS APPROVED. DO WE HAVE COMMUNICATIONS TODAY FROM THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR?
00:01:52.154: >> City Admin. Crawford: YES, MAYOR. WE ARE ALWAYS THANKFUL FOR THE SERVICE THAT YOUR PUBLIC SERVANTS DO FOR WORKING FOR THE CITY. I WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU ARE AWARE. THIS IS A PUBLIC SERVICE APPRECIATION WEEK, OR RECOGNITION WEEK, AND THIS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT IN THIS TIME, WHERE THEY ARE DOING SO MUCH FOR THE COMMUNITY AS THE COMMUNITY IS SHUT DOWN, BUT I DID WANT TO MAKE YOU AWARE OF THAT AND I WANT TO PUBLICLY SAY THANK YOU TO ALL THE STAFF. THIS IS DRINKING WATER WEEK WHICH RECOGNIZES THE PROFESSIONALS THAT DO SO MUCH TO ENSURE THAT THIS COUNTRY AND THIS COMMUNITY PROVIDE CLEAN AND SAFE DRINKING WATER. I ALSO WANTED TO SHARE WITH YOU THE COMMUNICATION THAT WE RECEIVED THAT THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR'S ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT RECEIVED THE ACHIEVEMENT OF EXCELLENCE AWARD FROM THE GOVERNMENT FINANCE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION. IT WAS RECEIVED THIS WEEK. AND KUDOS GO OUT TO KARLENE PUJA, WHO LEADS THE AUDIT THIS YEAR. AND LASTLY, I WILL NOTE THAT OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT FEW WEEKS, YOU AND THE COMMUNITY WILL RECEIVE COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE PARKS DEPARTMENT ABOUT THEIR STATUS ON HOW THEY ARE GOING TO BE PROGRESSING AND OPEN UP THE THINGS THAT THEY CAN AND MODIFY THE THINGS THAT THEY CAN. THAT'S ALL.
00:03:15.604: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. THERE ARE NO INTRODUCTIONS. AND SO KNOW NOW -- WHERE IS MY CHEAT SHEET? WE NOW COME TO PUBLIC COMMENT GENERAL TIME. PUBLIC COMMENT -- PARDON ME. RESERVE TIME. PUBLIC COMMENT RESERVE TIME IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO SPEAK TO THE COUNCIL AND THE COMMUNITY ABOUT MATTERS OF COMMUNITY INTEREST. WITH ONE NEEDS TO HAVE SIGNED UP IN ADVANCE BY CONTACTING OUR CITY CLERK. THE SPEAKERS HAVE THREE MINUTES IN WHICH TO SPEAK. PLEASE PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE CLERK, WHO WILL NOTIFY YOU AT 30 SECONDS, WHEN 30 SECONDS -- WHEN YOUR THREE MINUTES ARE UP, YOU WILL BE PUT ON MUTE AND WE WILL GO ON TO THE NEXT SPEAKER. I GUESS I DON'T HAVE THE REST OF MY CHEAT SHEET. HERE IT IS. LET ME SEE THAT. ROOKIE MISTAKE. LET ME SEE. SO YOUR PHONE NUMBER AND THE MEETING ID TO CALL IN SHOULD BE DISPLAYED OPEN THE SCREEN. CALLERS WILL BE IDENTIFIED ONE BY ONE BY THE CITY CLERK, USING THE LAST THREE DIGITS OF YOUR PHONE NUMBER. YOU WILL HEAR AN AUTOMATED ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE HOST IS ALLOWING YOU TO SPEAK. WHEN SPEAKING, PLEASE MOVE TO A QUIET AREA AND MUTE ANY TELEVISION OR BACKGROUND SOUNDS SO WE CAN HEAR YOU CLEARLY. IF THERE ARE SPEAKERS WHO ARE NEW TO CITY COUNCIL. PUBLIC COMMENT IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO CITY COUNCIL, AND COUNCIL LISTENS BUT DOES NOT DIRECTLY RESPOND. OUR FIRST SPEAKER TODAY IS SHANNON HA HAUTAMAKI.
00:04:46.228: >> I AM UNMUTED. HELLO?
00:04:49.765: >> Mayor Taylor: WE CAN HEAR YOU.
00:04:50.966: >> OKAY. GOOD. THANK YOU.
00:04:53.001: >> Mayor Taylor: MS. SAVABIEASFA HANI, OR ROTHER DR. SAVABIEASFAHANI, WE ARE STILL WAITING ON SHANNON HAUTAMAKI.
00:05:05.214: >> Clerk Beaudry: SORRY ABOUT THAT. MS. HAUTAMAKI?
00:05:14.156: >> HI. YES. THANK YOU ALL FOR HOLDING THIS PUBLIC MEETING OVER ZOOM. I WANT TO ESPECIALLY THANK COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN FOR POINTING OUT LAST TIME THAT MEETING VIRTUALLY PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR DIFFERENT VOICES NOT JUST THE ONES WHO HAVE FREE EVENINGS TO SPEND FOR HOURS AT A TIME. YOU ALSO HAVE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TONIGHT, AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE SMALL, INEXPENSIVE STEPS THAT CAN I CAN MAKETHE CITIZENS HEALTHIER AND HAPPIER. I ASK YOU TO LOOK AT THE DC-5. THE ONSET OF THE CORONAVIRUS HAS LEFT ME FEELING VERY FRUSTRATED. THERE'S NOT MUCH I CAN CONTROL RIGHT NOW. THE VIRUS IS IN CHARGE. THERE IS SO MUCH SUFFERING AND PAIN. PHYSICAL, EMOTIONAL AND ECONOMIC AND THERE'S NOT MUCH I CAN DO BUT STAY HOME AND KEEP MYSELF AND MY FAMILY HEALTHY. ONE WAY WE ARE DOING THAT IS BY TAKING FAMILY BIKE RIDES WHENEVER THE FAMILY ALLOWS. WE HAVE TWO KIDS 5 AND 2. MY 5-YEAR-OLD GOT HIS FIRST PEDAL BIKE AND HE RIDES FOR MILES AT A TIME WITHOUT TRAINING WHEELS. WHEN I HAVE TO SAY NO, HE CAN'T GO TO PRESCHOOL, NO HE CAN'T HAVE A BIRTHDAY PARTY. NO, HE CAN'T GO TO THE PARK. CAN'T GO TO A SWIMMING LESSON, CAN'T GO TO HIS FRIEND'S HOUSE OR THE DINOSAUR MUSEUM, CAN'T GO TO THE STORE, CAN'T VISIT HIS GRANDPARENTS, IT IS THE ONE THING TO WHICH I CAN FREELY SAY, YES, LET'S GO OUTSIDE AND RIDE YOUR BIKE. AS THE WEATHER WARMS, THE SIDEWALKS ARE GETTING CROWDED WITH LOTS OF PEOPLE. KIDS WHO HAVE EVERY RIGHT AND OUTSIDE ENJOYING THEIR BIKES, SCOOTERS AND SKATES, BUT ALSO DOG WALKERS, RUNNERS AND ALL OF THEM ARE DOING THE ONE THING THEY CAN SAFELY DO. I HAVE SEEN STATEMENTS FROM MEMBERS OF COUNCIL SAYING THAT THEY DON'T SEE A NEED FOR CLOSING STREETS BECAUSE IT'S EASY FOR THEMSELVES PERSONALLY TO MOVE INTO THE ROAD. BUT I WOULD ENCOURAGE THEM TO THINK OUTSIDE OF THEIR OWN EXPERIENCES. IT'S NOT EASY OR SAFE FOR A 5-YEAR-OLD TO VEER INTO THE ROAD. IT'S ALSO NOT EASY FOR SOMEONE IN A WHEELCHAIR OR SOMEONE WITH A CANE OR OTHER ASSISTANCE. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO CLOSE ROADS WHERE THERE ARE SIDEWALK GAPS. MY FAMILY IS LUCKY TO HAVE A SMALL YARD AND TO LIVE IN A NEIGHBORHOOD WITH SIDEWALKS BUT THERE ARE MANY FAMILIES IN THE CITY WHO DON'T HAVE THAT PRIVILEGE. OPENING STREETS ALSO OFFERS UNIQUE OPPORTUNITIES FOR ARTISTS TO DRAW ON THE STREETS AND MUSICIANS TO PUT ON IMPROMPTU PERFORMANCES ALL WHILE EXERCISING SAFE SOCIAL DETAINING PRACTICES. THIS COULD OPEN RESTAURANTS AND ONCE AGAIN BE PROFITABLE BY PUTTING TABLES IN THE CLOSED DOWN ROADS. I HAVE FULL CONFIDENCE THAT THE CITY STAFF CAN CLOSE APPROPRIATE ROADS WITH LITTLE COST OR TURMOIL. IT'S BEEN DONE IN MANY OTHER CITIES MUCH MORE QUICKLY. THE LONGER WE WAIT, THE MORE FRUSTRATED OUR CITIZENRY BECOMES. SUMMER FEST --
00:08:10.232: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
00:08:12.301: >> THE ROLLING SCULPTURE CAR SHOW AND OTHER ANN ARBOR EVENTS ARE PROBABLY HEADED IN THE SAME DIRECTION. ANN ARBOR NEEDS A WIN RIGHT NOW. THIS IS SOMETHING SIMPLE THAT YOU ALL HAVE THE POWER TO IMPLEMENT TO MAKE LIFE A LITTLE EASIER AND HAPPIER AND I URGE YOU TO OPEN UP OUR STREETS TO CITIES AND BIKES, AND PEDSES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
00:08:36.725: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS MOZHGAN SAVABIEASFAHANI.
00:08:47.302: >> HELLO?
00:08:48.136: >> Clerk Beaudry: GO AHEAD.
00:08:49.538: >> Mayor Taylor: HELLO.
00:08:50.872: >> OKAY. THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. AND MY NAME IS MOZHGAN SAVABIEASFAHANI. I AM RUNNING FOR CITY COUNCIL SEAL WARD 4. I WANT TO INVITE EVERYONE IN ANN ARBOR TO GO TO MY WEBSITE, VOTEFORTHEDOCTOR.COM. I HAVE POSTED AND EMAILED THE CITY COUNCIL WHAT I WILL DO DURING THE FIRST 100 DAYS AFTER I REPLACE MR. EATON. I WANT TO INVITE EVERYONE TO GO AND READ THAT. HERE I WILL GIVE YOU A SHORT PART OF THE INFORMATION THAT I WILL PUT ON MY WEBSITE. AS SOON AS I TAKE OVER JACK EATON'S SEAT ON THE CITY COUNCIL, I WILL TELL THE CITY COUNCIL TO STOP KICKING THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD WHEN IT COMES TO GELMAN CONTAMINATION. I WILL DEMAND A RESOLUTION COMMITTING THE CITY TO CLEAN UP THAT GELMAN CONTAMINATION IMMEDIATELY. NO ONE ELSE IS GOING TO DO IT. THEN, I WILL TELL THE CITY COUNCIL THEY MUST ENACT A $15 MINIMUM WAGE LAW FOR THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR SO PEOPLE WHO WORK HERE WITH LIVE HERE. THEN, I WILL TELL THE CITY COUNCIL TO PUT ITS MONEY WHERE ITS MOUTH IS ON GOOD JOBS AND EDUCATION. THAT MEANS A MAJOR INCREASE IN CITY FUNDING TO THE NEUTRAL ZONES JOB CORPS PROGRAM SO THAT EVERY CHILD IN THIS TOWN CAN GET INTO COLLEGE OR A TRADE SCHOOL AND IT WILL BE FOLLOWED BY A GOOD JOB. THEN I WILL TELL THE CITY TO PUT ITS MONEY WHERE ITS MOUTH IS ABOUT COVID-19 PANDEMIC WHICH IS DECIMATING THE BLACK COMMUNITY. I DEMAND A RESOLUTION TELLING THE CONGRESS TO ENACT MEDICARE FOR ALL. I WILL TELL THE CITY COUNCIL TO BUCKLE UP AND REJECT RACISM WHICH IS DEADLIER THAN COVID-19. I WILL DEMAND A RESOLUTION REQUESTING THAT THE US CONGRESS APPROVE UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME, PAYMENTS OF 2,000 PER ADULT PER MONTH, AND FAILING THAT, THE MICHIGAN LEGISLATURE MUST DO SO. I WILL TELL THE CITY COUNCIL TO GET A BACKBONE AND STAND UP FOR HUMAN RIGHTS. I WILL DEMAND A SIMPLE SEVEN WARD CITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION WHICH STATES THAT WE ARE AGAINST MILITARY AID TO ISRAEL. I HOPE EVERYONE ON CITY COUNCIL NOW IS FIRMLY AGAINST GIVING $38 BILLION TO THAT RACIST STATE OF ISRAEL. RIGHT NOW, WE NEED THAT MONEY HERE.
00:11:25.494: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
00:11:26.394: >> WE NEED THAT MONEY HERE. I WOULD LIKE EVERYONE TO THINK ABOUT ALL THAT I HAVE SAID AND I WILL WAIT TO HEAR FROM THEM. WHAT DO THEY HAVE TO SAY FOR ALL I HAVE PLANNED FOR THEM TO DO?
00:11:43.311: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
00:11:44.112: >> WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY, MR. MAYOR? WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY, MR. EATON? MS. NELSON, YOU REPRESENT WARD 4. WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY WHAT I HAVE JUST TOLD YOU.
00:11:55.590: >> Clerk Beaudry: TIME.
00:11:56.124: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS BLAINE COLEMAN.
00:12:02.964: >> WE ARE AGAINST MILITARY AID TO ISRAEL. THAT IS THE SEVEN WARD RESOLUTION WE HAVE BEEN DEMANDING FOR YEARS AT THE ANN ARBOR CITY COUNCIL. NOW, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE LANDSCAPE NOW, WITH COVID DECIMATING THE BLACK COMMUNITY IN THE UNITED STATES, WITH COVID TURNING TENS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE TO UNEMPLOYED, COMPLETELY BROKE PEOPLE WHO CANNOT PAY THEIR RENT, DO YOU HE  REALLY WT TO PAY $38 BILLION TO ISRAEL? TO KEEP GUNNING DOWN PALESTINIANS? REALLY? DO YOU WANT TO KEEP PAYING ISRAEL $38 BILLION TO KEEP MASSACRING THOUSANDS OF PALESTINIANS? IS THERE ANYBODY ON THIS CITY COUNCIL WHO WOULD RAISE THEIR HAND AND SAY, YEAH, YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO KEEP GIVING ISRAEL $38 BILLION TO KEEP MURDERING MINES. I SURE HOPE THIS IS NOBODY THAT INSANE ON THE CITY COUNCIL. I SURE HOPE. EVEN IN THE BEST OF TIMES, YOU DON'T WANT TO PAY. I SURE HOPE YOU DON'T WANT TO PAY $38 BILLION TO ISRAEL TO KEEP MASS MURDERING PALESTINIANS. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS SO ELEMENTARY I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY FOR JUST ABOUT 28 YEARS YOU HAVE REFUSED TO EVEN ALLOW A HEARING ON THE SUBJECT OF THIS RESOLUTION. IN CASE YOU FORGOT, THE SEVEN WORD RESOLUTION IS:  WE ARE AGAINST MILITARY AID TO ISRAEL. SEVEN LITTLE WORDS THAT WOULD SAVE MANY, MANY PALESTINIAN LIVES. ONE MORE THING. DON'T FORGET THERE ARE MANY, MANY PALESTINIANS WHO ARE MEMBERS OF THIS ANN ARBOR COMMUNITY LIVING RIGHT HERE AND IF THERE WERE NONE, IT WOULD STILL BE YOUR OBLIGATION. IT WOULD STILL BE YOUR OBLIGATION TO MAKE A STAND FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND PASS THAT RESOLUTION. WE ARE AGAINST MILITARY AID TO ISRAEL. I MEAN, WHAT DOES IT TAKE? RIGHT NOW ISRAEL IS GOBBLING UP MORE AND MORE AND MORE PALESTINIAN LAND UNDER COVER OF THIS COVID-19 EPIDEMIC. ISRAEL IS EVEN DESTROYING A PALESTINIAN COVID-19 --
00:14:33.915: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
00:14:35.183: >> ISRAEL IS EVEN DESTROYING A PALESTINIAN COVID-19 CLINIC! I MEAN, FOR FOR GOD'S SAY, WHATS IT TAKE FOR YOU PEOPLE TO OPEN YOUR EYES AND APPROVE THIS SIMPLE, SIMPLE, BONE-HEAD SIMPLE RESOLUTION FOR HUMAN RIGHTS WHICH SAYS "WE ARE AGAINST MILITARY AID TO ISRAEL." WHAT DOES IT TAKE? ANY ANSWERS?
00:15:05.280: >> Clerk Beaudry: TIME.
00:15:05.814: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS HENRY HERSKOVITZ.
00:15:13.021: >> Clerk Beaudry: GO AHEAD.
00:15:15.724: >> GOOD EVENING. AN OPINION PIECE BY FMU'S RICK HALPERN WAS SPR PRINTED BY ANN R NEWS. THE DEATH CAMPS AMID OUR PANDEMIC. MR. HALPERN WANTS HIS READERS TO BE ONCE AGAIN REMINDED OF APRIL HISTORICAL EVENT, NOW 75 YEARS OLD. HE WRITES, IT IS BELIEVED THAT ABOUT 1.1 MILLION INDIVIDUALS, INCLUDING WOMEN, CHILDREN, AND THOSE WITH DISABILITIES WERE MURDERED AT AUSCHWITZ BERKANOW. WHAT HE DOESN'T INFORM HIS READERS, THE 1.1 MILLION FIGURE WASN'T ALWAYS SO. ACCORDING TO MANY SOURCES, INCLUDING THE "CHICAGO TRIBUNE" AND "THE NEW YORK TIMES," THE SOVIET ARMY OCCUPIED THE CAMP IN JANUARY 1945 AND TOOK ALL THE CAMP'S DEATH RECORDS. PROVDA THEN ANNOUNCED TO THE WORLD, 4 MILLION PEOPLE SUFFERED AND DIED HERE AT THE HANDS OF THE NAZI MURDERERS BETWEEN THE YEARS 1940 AND 1945. THIS WAS INSCRIBED IN 19 DIFFERENT LANGUAGES ON  19 METAL PLAQUES AT AUSCHWITZ FOR OVER 40 YEARS. THEN IN 1989, SOVIET PRESIDENT GORBACHEV RELEASED THE CAPTURED DEATH BOOKS CAUSING THE DIRECTOR TO REMOVE THE PLAQUES AND INSTALL NEW ONES WHICH NOW READ "FOREVER LET THIS PLACE BE A CRY OF DESPAIR AND A WARNING TO HUMANITY WITH THE NAZIS MURDERED ABOUT 1.5 MILLION MEN, WOMEN AND CHILDREN, MAINLY JEWS FROM VARIOUS COUNTRIES OF EUROPE." MR. HALPERN'S FIGURE IS EVEN LESS THAN THIS. AND THE POINT TO BE MADE HERE IS THAT WITH THE ADDITION OF NEWLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION, NUMBERS CHANGE. THIS IS THE ESSENCE OF REVISIONISM, AND HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH DENIAL. AND AS NUMBERS CHANGE, DOESN'T IT MAKE SENSE TO QUESTION OTHER ALLEGATIONS? FOR EXAMPLE, HALPERN'S CHARGE THAT THE SO-CALLED FINAL SOLUTION WAS TO RID THE WORLD OF JEWS. THIS MUST COME AS A SHOCK TO TRADITIONAL HOLOCAUST HISTORIANS.
00:17:53.414: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
00:17:54.616: >> MR. HALPERN TAKES AN ENORMOUS LEAP OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM WHEN HE EXTRAPOLATES WITHOUT ANY SUPPORT WHATEVER FROM EUROPE TO THE WORLD. BY DOING SO HE CONTRIBUTES TO UNKED PSEUDOSCIENCE, WHICH IS THEN DISSEMINATED TO A GULLIBLE PUBLIC. THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR AND COUNCIL.
00:18:20.408: >> Mayor Taylor: OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS JOHN MIL MIL MILES A.
00:18:29.284: >> Clerk Beaudry: GO AHEAD.
00:18:29.918: >> THANK YOU FOR YOUR PUBLIC SERVICE. AS YOU KNOW, ANN ARBOR EMITS 2 MILLION TONS OF GREENHOUSE GASES EVERY YEAR. THOSE EMISSIONS ARE ATMOSPHERIC SEWAGE. WE HAVE KNOWINGLY CONTRIBUTED TO A TRAGEDY OF THE COMMONS, POLLUTED A SHARED RESOURCE, OUR ATMOSPHERE FOR DECADES. CLIMATE CHANGE WILL CAUSE INCREASINGLY DEVASTATING IMPACTS WITH HUGE SOCIAL COSTS, ULTIMATELY BORNE DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY BY RESIDENTS. PROTECTING THE PLANET AND THE CITY FROM SUCH CONSEQUENCES SHOULD BE A BASIC CITY SERVICE. IT IS FOUNDATIONAL TO MASLOW'S MOST BASIC OF HUMAN NEEDS. YOU SET A 2030 CARBON NEUTRALITY AND ASKED THE CITY STAFF FOR A PLAN TO ACHIEVE IT. YOU DIDN'T ASK FOR A 60% PLAN BASED ON LOW-HANGING FRUIT. YOU DIDN'T ADD CAVEATS. YOU WANTED IT ON THE BEST SCIENCE, POLL CYLS, TECHNOLOGIES AND LESSONS LEARNED FROM AROUND THE WORLD. THE CITY WITH THE HELP AND THE INPUT OF HUNDREDS DELIVERS THAT PLAN. THE CREATION,.
00:21:34.901: >> Clerk Beaudry: TIME.
00:21:34.901: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS  IS GEOFF H.
00:21:46.314: >> Clerk Beaudry: GO AHEAD, MR. HENNY.
00:21:48.116: >> HELLO, MY NAME IS GEOFF HENNY. AND I'M A RESIDENT IS 48104 AREA. I HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE TASK FORCE FOR THE CENTER OF THE CITY, THE COMMONS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DEVELOP. AND I'M SPEAKING TODAY ON BEHALF OF THAT -- A RESOLUTION WHICH IS BEING PUT FORTH TO YOU TODAY TO ACCEPT THE FINAL REPORT OF THE TASK FORCE. I WAS A FORMAL ADVISOR TO THE TASK FORCE, AND I FOUND THE WORK OF THE TASK FORCE TO BE EXCEPTIONAL. MANY DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEW WERE REPRESENTED AN THAT TASK FORCE. ALTHOUGH THERE WERE DISAGREEMENTS, THE GROUP CAME TOGETHER FOR A GOOD SET OF RESOLUTIONS FOR THE CITY WHICH I URGE YOU TO ADOPT TODAY THIS RESOLUTION. I WANT TO REMIND EVERYBODY OF THE MAIN CONCLUSIONS OR LET'S SAY THE MAIN RECOMMENDATIONS. ONE IS TO FACILITATE THE FORMATION OF THE ANN ARBOR COUNCIL OF THE COMMONS. TWO, SCHEDULE REGULAR MEETINGS OF THE CENTER OF CITY GROUP. AND THREE BEGIN TO REDESIGN AS AN ACTIVE PUBLIC SPACE. AND FOUR THE LONG-TERM DEVELOPMENT OF THE CENTER OF THE CITY BLOCK AS A PRIORITY UNDER THE CITY'S MASTER PLAN, FIVE, AUTHORIZE INITIAL PLANNINGS OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PUBLIC SPACES ON THE CENTER OF THE CITY BLUESMAN SIX, NEGOTIATE THE POTENTIAL AGREEMENT AND EASEMENTS TO ALLOW FOR FOOT EXPANSION OF THE CENTER OF THE CITY BLOCK. THAT'S ABOUT A PHYSICAL LOCATION, BUT THE COMMONS IS MUCH MORE THAN THAT BECAUSE IT IS REALLY A THIRD FORCE BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT -- THE BALANCED GOVERNMENT AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR. I THINK IT COULD CONTRIBUTE IMMENSELY TO THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR AND ITS RESIDENTS. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO -- WE HAVE AN INITIATING COMMITTEE OF ACTIVISTS THAT IS PUTTING THE COMMONS TOGETHER. WE ARE PUTTING A WEBSITE UP. WE LIVE IN THE ERA OF CORONAVIRUS BUT WE HAVE TO DO A LOT OF VIRTUAL THINGS. WE ARE PUTTING A WEBSITE TOGETHER AND WE ARE STARTING TO MOBILIZE AND ACTIVATE ALL THE DIFFERENT GROUPS THAT ARE INTERESTED IN BEING IN THE COMMONS, INCLUDING THE ECO VILLAGES AND SO FORTH IN ANN ARBOR.
00:24:17.598: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
00:24:18.733: >> AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE INTERIM CITY MANAGER, TOM CRAWFORD TO ADVANCE THE NEXT STAGES OF THIS AND WE HOPE THAT YOU WOULD ENCOURAGE THE COLLABORATION BETWEEN -- WITH US ON BEHALF OF THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE CITY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR SUPPORT.
00:24:42.456: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS MICHELLE HUGHES.
00:24:50.197: >> HI. I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT -- HI, I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT DC-2, THE RESOLUTION TO SUPPORT THE FAIR AND EQUAL MICHIGAN CAMPAIGN. SO WE HAVE GOT ON THE -- THE CAMPAIGN IS A BALLOT INITIATIVE TO AMEND THE STATE'S ELLIOTT LARSON CIVIL RIGHTS ACT, INCLUDE -- TO PROHIBIT DISCRIMINATION BY SEXUAL ORIENTATION, GENDER IDENTITY AND GENDER EXPRESSION. A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T EVEN REALIZE THAT IT'S COMPLETELY LEGAL TO FIRE SOMEONE IN THE STATE OF MICHIGAN FOR BEING GAY, FOR BEING TRANSGENDER. AND WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET LAWMAKERS FOR YEARS IN MICHIGAN TO, YOU KNOW, PASS A BILL TO CHANGE THAT, AND TO ADD PROTECTIONS FOR LGBTQ PEOPLE, AND THEY JUST DON'T SEEM TO BE INTERESTED IN DOING THAT. SO THIS YEAR, WE ARE GOING AROUND THEM BY DOING THIS PETITION AND WE GOT TO GET 340,000 SIGNATURES BY MAY MAY 27th. AND WE'LL GET IT ON THE BALLOT. I THINK -- I THINK IS SOMETHING THAT WILL DO WELL AT THE BALLOT. WE HAVE THE -- THE PETITION HAS ALREADY BEEN ENDORSED BY THE BIG THREE AUTOMAKERS, AND THE ANN ANNARBOR, AND THE YPSILANTI, AND YOU HAVE WHAT IS REFERRED TO IN POLITICS AS A BROAD CONSENSUS. AND I THINK WE ALSO HAVE THAT HERE ON THE CITY COUNCIL BECAUSE I KNOW THAT EACH AND EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU HAS SIGNED THE PETITION, AND I NO HE THAT MAYOR TAYLOR HAS ADDED HIS NAME TO THE LIST OF OVER 20 MAYORS IN MICHIGAN WHO SUPPORT THE PETITION. SO I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT DC-2 IS GOING TO BE APPROVED UNANIMOUSLY TONIGHT. BUT -- SO REALLY, I'M TALKING TO I THINK ALL THE ANN ARBOR CITY COUNCIL WATCHERS TONIGHT, BECAUSE THIS IS YOUR CHANCE. YOU HAVE A COMPUTER IN FRONT OF YOU. I URGE YOU TO GO OVER TO THE WEBSITE, FAIRANDEQUALMICHIGAN.COM, BECAUSE THE PETITION CAN NOW BE SIGNED ONLINE. SO SINCE YOU HAVE A COMPUTER IN FRONT OF YOU, GO AHEAD AND DO IT RIGHT NOW. IT JUST TAKES A COUPLE OF MINUTES AND IT WILL BE GREAT. WE CAN HAVE -- WE'LL HAVE SOME BASIC CIVIL RIGHTS FOR LGBTQ PEOPLE HERE IN MICHIGAN. THANKS FOR CONSIDERING THIS. THANKS IN ADVANCE FOR APPROVING IT UNANIMOUSLY.
00:27:33.694: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
00:27:34.361: >> AND THANKS TO ALL OF YOU WHO ARE GOING TO GO SIGN IT RIGHT NOW. THANKS, BYE.
00:27:39.934: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS DAVID SHINABARGER.
00:27:47.608: >> YEAH, HI, EVERYONE, MY NAME IS DAVID SHINABARGER. I'M A RESIDENT IN THE FIRST WARD. A QUICK SHOUT OUT TO KATHY GRISWOLD FOR TELLING ME TO CALL. IT'S ACTUALLY REALLY GREAT NOT HAVING TO TRAVEL DOWNTOWN IN PERSON ON A WEEK NIGHT. I WOULD LIKE TO ECHO WHAT SHANNON SAID EARLIER, I'M HERE TO VOICE SUPPORT FOR THE DC-5, FOR LANE CLOSURES. I HAVE GONE ON MANY BIKE RIDES IN THE PAST WEEK. YESTERDAY, I THINK THE STREETS OF NOMAR GA ANN ARBOR HAD MORE N CARS. WE KNOW THAT OTHER CITIES LIKE SAN DIEGO HAVE HAD A 400% INCREASE IN BIKES. OUR STREETS ARE ESSENTIALLY ESSY EMPTY RIGHT NOW. PLEASE DON'T DELAY THIS. DELAYING IT COULD POTENTIALLY CAUSE PEOPLE THEIR LIVES. SOME COMMENTS ON DC-5, I DON'T LOVE THE WORDING OF THE -- AND RECEIVED COUNCIL APPROVAL IN ADVANCE STREET CONFIGURATION OF RESIDENTIAL STREETS. THIS ENABLES THE COUNCIL TO VETO IMPORTANT AND NONRESIDENTIAL STREETS AS THEY COME UP. FOR EXAMPLE, BROADWAY BRIDGE IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF A NONRESIDENTIAL STREET THAT IS CURRENTLY TO WALK OR BIKE ACROSS WHILE MAINTAINING THE 6-FOOT DISTANCE REQUIRED. THIS WORDING WOULD ALLOW COUNCIL TO VETO THESE SPOTS, BUT AT SOME POINT WE HAVE TO DECIDE BETWEEN TRAFFIC CONGESTION OR SAFER STREETS AND I'M ASKING YOU TO PLEASE SAFER STREETS AS THE BEST OPTION. THIS IS A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE OUR CITY FOR THE BETTER AND MAYBE FOR THE FIRST TIME, FOCUS ON PEOPLE, FAMILIES AND CHILDREN INSTEAD OF PRIORITIZING CARS ABOVE ALL ELSE. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO RETURNING THIS PUBLIC SPACE TO PEOPLE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. IT WILL MAKE OUR COMMUNITY MORE LIVABLE. IT WILL MAKE OUR COMMUNITY MORE BEAUTIFUL. IT WILL MAKE OUR COMMUNITY MORE PEACEFUL AND QUIET BY LOWERING NOISE POLLUTION. IT WILL MAKE OUR COMMUNITY SAFER FOR COVID-19 AND IT'S A BIG STEP TOWARDS OUR COMM COMMUNITY'S VIN OF VISION ZERO. THIS WOULD ENCOURAGE PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY TO NAVIGATE ON FOOT, SKATEBOARD OR BICYCLE OR NON-MOTORIZED TRANSIT LIKE NEVER BEFORE. IN MY OPINION, ANY STEP TOWARDS NON-MOTORIZED TRANSPORTATION IS A HUGE STEP FORWARD FOR OUR COMMUNITY AND IT'S A HUGE STEP FORWARD IN OUR CLIMATE ACTION AND OUR VISION0 GOALS AND I'M PERSONALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND LEADERSHIP AS PUBLIC SERVANTS. THANK YOU.
00:30:26.000: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. ARE THERE COMMUNICATIONS TODAY FROM COUNCIL? COUNCILMEMBER NELSON -- COUNCILMEMBER NELSON AND BANNISTER, CAN -- MS. BEAUDRY, CAN WE GET THE HAND RAISING FUNCTION? IN THE MEANTIME, WE HAVE GOT NELSON, BANNISTER. COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
00:30:56.063: >> Councilmember Nelson:  JUST A -- WOULD YOU RATHER I HAVE ELECTRONICALLY RAISED MY HAND? WOULD YOU HAVE PREFERRED THAT?
00:31:03.404: >> Mayor Taylor: IT IS A LITTLE EASIER IF THERE'S A FLURRY AND IT MAKES SURE -- IT ENSURES THAT I GET THE QUEUE IN ORDER. SO --
00:31:10.577: >> Councilmember Nelson: GOTCHA.
00:31:12.313: >> Mayor Taylor: NO WORRIES.
00:31:13.280: >> Councilmember Nelson: THANK YOU. I JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF QUICK ANNOUNCEMENTS, I -- SINCE OUR LAST MEETING, I HAVE REALLY -- I'VE SOME REALLY EXCELLENT CONVERSATIONS WITH HEAVY HITTERS IN OUR CITY STAFF AND I WOULD RECOMMEND ANYBODY WHO IS INTERESTED, I HAVE SOME INTERVIEWS ON A2COVID1.COM, ANDD OUR COMMUNITY SERVICES ADD SERVE ADMINISTRATOR AND I HAVE MORE EXCITING INTERVIEWED SCHEDULES TO DO THIS WEEK. ANYBODY WHO IS INTERESTED IN HEARING SOME PERSPECTIVE FROM OUR CITY STAFF, WOULD ARE REALLY -- WHO ARE REALLY HELPING OUR CITY MOVE FORWARD EVEN IN THESE STRANGE CIRCUMSTANCES, THAT'S ONE THING I WANTED TO ANNOUNCE. SPECIFICALLY TO WARD 4, THERE AHE IS SOME ROADWORK THAT WILL START ON MONDAY MAY 11th ON ARDMORE TO WEST STADIUM. AVONDALE TO GREENVIEW AND GLEN LEAVEN FROM GREENVIEW TO AND NORMANDY TO MERCHAND TO GREENVIEW. THAT'S VERY EXCITING FOR THOSE OF US WHO WOULD LIKE TO SEE OUR ROADS IMPROVED.
00:32:32.092: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
00:32:33.327: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES. WARD ONE NEIGHBORHOOD GROUP, THE OLD FOURTH WARD ASSOCIATION IS PLEASED TO REPORT THAT ON THIS THURSDAY AT 4:30 BECOME, THERE WILL BE A WEBINAR ABOUT A NEW DEVELOPMENT PROJECT COMING DOWN THE ROAD IN WARD 1. THE DEVELOPER IS DOUG SELBY FROM MEADOW LARK DESIGN AND BUILD AND THEY ARE REMODELING A FOUR UNIT RENTAL BUILDING AT 530 NORTH DIVISION, AND YOU ALL -- EVERYONE IS INVITED TO ATTEND THE WEBINAR BECAUSE IT'S THE WORLD'S FIRST LIVING, BUILDING AND PASSIVE MULTIFAMILY RESIDENTS WHICH WILL BE DESIGNED TO PRODUCE MORE ENERGY THAN IT USES AND RESPONSIBLY MANAGE WATER ON SITE AND ACHIEVE NET ZERO WASTE.

00:34:11.425: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
00:34:14.428: >> Councilmember Grand: INK THAT YOU. JUST QUICKLY, I WANTED TO POINT EVERYONE TO -- TO THE COUNCIL COMMUNICATIONS, IN PARTICULAR RELATED TO THE GREEN BELT THAT I HOPE THAT WE WILL BE REAPPOINTING STEPHANIE STAUFFER, WHILE SHE'S LISTED AS A REPRESENTATIVE AT LARGE, SHE IS ACTUALLY AN ACTIVE FARMER AND SOMEONE WHO IS VERY INVESTED IN THE LOCAL FOOD MOVEMENT. SO HAVING HER ON THE GREEN BELT NOT ONLY BRINGS SOMEONE WHO IS INVOLVED IN LOCAL FOOD BUT IT GIVES US ANOTHER FARMING PERSPECTIVE, AND SOMEONE WOULD FARMS VERY CLOSE TO THE -- WHO FARMS VERY CLOSE TO THE CITY LIMITS. I HOPE YOU WOULD JOIN ME IN SUPPORTING HER.
00:35:05.312: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER COMMUNICATIONS FROM COUNCIL. COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
00:35:09.283: >> Councilmember Griswold: GOOD EVENING. I WANT TO THANK STAFF FOR THE TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK THAT'S BEING DONE. I THINK TO THE PUBLIC, IN SOME CASES, THEY ARE MAKING IT LOOK EASY. IT'S NOT. ONE. THINGS THAT I HAVE BEEN FOCUSING ON IS COLLABORATION. AND I FIGURE IF I CAN GET GOOD AT COLLABORATING DURING THE VIRUS, WHEN WE ARE USING ZOOM AND WE CAN'T MEET FACE-TO-FACE, THEN IT WILL BE REALLY GREAT WHEN WE ARE ABLE TO MEET AND WORK TOGETHER AGAIN IN GROUPS. I WANTED TO ADDRESS ONE TOPIC THAT CAME UP REGARDING DC-5, AND I WOULD JUST LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THE FINAL WHEREAS CLAUSE AND ALL OF THE RESOLVE CLAUSES WERE WRITTEN BY STAFF. AND SO THERE IS STAFF APPROVAL REQUIRED IN SOME CASES. AND THAT'S THE PREFERENCE OF STAFF, BECAUSE IF WE CLOSE A ROAD OR MAKE CHANGES TO ONE ROAD IN THE DOWNTOWN AREA, IT CAN HAVE IMPACTS ON OTHER ROADS. WE ALSO HAVE TO COORDINATE WITH THE DDA. EVEN SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS A BROADWAY BRIDGE, YOU CAN LOOK AT IT THROUGH A NUMBER OF STREETS THAT INTERSECT WITH THAT BRIDGE. SO IT'S REALLY MORE COMPLEX THAN ONE MIGHT THINK. AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE CONSIDERING ALL -- ALL OF THE VARIABLES, LET'S JUST CALL IT THAT. AND, AGAIN, I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE WOULD WORKED ON THE REVISED DC-5.

I'M SPEAKING IN FAVOR OF COMPLETING THOSE SIDEWALK GAPS ON THE WEST SIDE OF -- OF NIXON ROAD ON NORTH SIDE OF TRAVER. SIDEWALKS OUT HERE ARE FAIRLY HEAVILY USED, WITH -- IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT STUDENTS AT LOGAN HAVE ALTERNATE WAY BY GOING THROUGH A -- A PATH THAT CONNECTS THE PLAYGROUND WITH NEW DEVELOPMENT, HOWEVER, THAT PATH AT THE PRESENT, PROBABLY FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE IS A CONSTRUCTION SITE WITH NO SIDEWALKS. SO IT'S NOT A SAFE AREA. THEY HAVE TO CONTEND WITH CONSTRUCTION VEHICLES AND MATERIALS PILED UP. ALSO, IT HAS BEEN CONTENDED THAT IT SHOULD WAIT UNTIL THEY -- NIXON ROAD PROJECT IS BEING DONE, AND ACTUALLY IT'S BETTER TO HAVE THAT -- THIS COMPLETED NOW. IT'S BEEN DELAYED A COUPLE OF YEARS AS IT IS UNTIL THEY FIGURE OUT A WAY TO PUT IN THE SIDEWALK WITHOUT INTERFERING WEEKEND THAT PROJECT. AND THIS WOULD MEAN THAT RESIDENTS WOULD NOT HAVE TO CROSS THE CONSTRUCTION AREA IF THEY WANTED TO WALK ON THE WEST SIDE OF NIXON ROAD. AND THOSE OF US WHO HAVE LIVED ON THIS AREA FOR A LONG TIME NEED MORE RECENT -- THE MORE RECENT RESIDENTS HAVE PAID FOR SIDEWALKS AS PART OF THE CONSTRUCTION OF THEIR PROJECTS, AND I THINK IT'S PART OF A CIVIC DUTY FOR PEOPLE TO PAY FOR SIDEWALKS ALONG THEIR PROPERTY.

01:18:15.533: >> EXCELLENT. I WANT TO SAY REALLY SHORTLY, IN THE MIDST OF THE CURRENT CRISIS, WITH COVID AND THE MIDST OF THIS SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC IMPACT, THE REVENUE IMPACT THAT WILL FALL OUT FROM THIS, IT IS A SEVERE SITUATION. IT'S HIT US VERY QUICKLY. THE CLIMATE CRISIS IS A CUMULATIVE CRISIS. IT'S ACCUMULATING. IT HAS BEEN AND IT WILL CONTINUE TO ACCUMULATE OVER TIME. IT TOO IS SEVERE. IT NEEDS YOUR ATTENTION. IT NEEDS YOUR PRIORITY. AND IT NEEDS YOUR FUNDING. AND THE FUNDING, I CAN IMAGINE WILL BE A CHALLENGE. ASO I WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO RECOMMEND A TASK FORCE COME TOGETHER OF A WHOLE LOT OF REALLY SMART PEOPLE FROM A CROSS-SECTION. CITY AND KEY CONSTITUENTS AND FIGURE OUT WHAT A REVENUE STRATEGY LOOKS LIKE THIS YEAR, AND OVER TIME TO PUT ANN ARBOR IN A POSITION TO PARTNER WITH THE UNIVERSITY AND MOVE FORWARD WITH A SOLUTION TO THIS CLIMATE CRISIS. U OF M IS MOVING FORWARD. OVER 1400 FACULTY HAVE PETITIONED THE PRESIDENT AND THE REGIONS AND THEIR CLIMATE NEUTRALITY PLAN. I BELIEVE WITH THE STUDENTS, THEY, WE, ARE GETTING HEARD. THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE TEAMS WITHIN THE PRESIDENTIAL COMMISSION ARE BEING DELIVERED LATE APRIL, EARLY MAY. THIS SUMMER WILL BE A PUBLIC INPUT, DELIBERATION PROCESS. THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS WILL FINALLY GO FORWARD IN THE FALL. ANN ARBOR NEEDS TO BE POISED AND READY AND FUNDED TO BE A PARTNER WITH THE UNIVERSITY SINCE WE SHARE THE SAME GOAL. WE NEED GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS DON'T KNOW CAMPUS BOUNDARIES OR ANN ARBOR BOUNDARIES. WE NEED A REGIONAL PLAN. IN BETWEEN U OF M AND ANN ARBOR, TWO LEADERS IN THE REGION.

I'M CALLING TO VOICE MY SUPPORT FOR FUNDING OF THE OFFICE OF SUSTAINABLE AND THE A2ZERO PLAN. IT'S UNDERSTOOD BY EVERYONE THAT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT, THAT IT'S A VERY PRESSING ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. I THINK THE PANDEMIC THAT WE HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING LATELY HIGHLIGHTS SOME OF THE PROBLEMS IN OUR INFRASTRUCTURE, SOME OF THE PROBLEMS IN OUR OPERATIONS AS A COMMUNITY AND NOT JUST LOCALLY BUT AT THE STATE AND THE FEDERAL LEVEL. WE ARE AT A POINT WHERE WE CAN LOOK AT THESE FAILINGS, LOOK AT THESE COMPLICATIONS AND USE THAT INFORMATION TO IN INFORM ADDRESG CLIMATE CHANGE MOVING FORWARD. WE NEED THE OFFICE FUNDED, WELL FUNDED AND WE NEED TO GET PLANS IN MAC M PLACE TO GET FUNDING FM OUTSIDE SOURCES AND MOVE FORWARD WITH THESE THINGS. THERE ARE SOME -- SOME DECISIONS THAT NEED TO BE MADE THAT MIGHT BE DIFFICULT, AND I THINK THAT EXPLAINING THESE DECISIONS TO THE PUBLIC WILL BE AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF WHAT CITY COUNCILMEMBERS DO IN THEIR JOB. YOU ARE LEADERS AND WE ENTRUSTED YOU WITH THE RESPONSE TO LEAD. SO PLEASE FUND THE OFFICE OF SUSTAINABILITY AND THE A2ZERO PLAN AND PLEASE LEAD BY LEADING TO THE RIGHT DECISIONS IN OUR COMMUNITY TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

01:23:25.743: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER 805, YOU CAN GO AHEAD.
01:23:27.445: >> OKAY. THANK YOU. HAD THANK YOU FOR YOUR PUBLIC SERVICE. MY NAME IS BARBARA HIGGMAN. I'M A LONG-TIME RESIDENT OF THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. I'M CALLING BECAUSE I'M PASSIONATELY CONCERNED ABOUT THE WELL-BEING OF PEOPLE WITH A MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION WHO LIVE IN ANN ARBOR. EVEN IF I DID NOT LIVE WITH THE AFFLICTION MYSELF, I WOULD BE DEEPLY TROUBLED BY THE POTENTIAL MISAPPROPRIATION BY THE CITY COUNCIL OF FUNDS MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE MENTAL HEALTH AND PUBLIC SAFETY MILLAGE. THE CITY HAD A PRIOR OBLIGATION TO FUND CLIMATE CHANGE ACTION BUT IT WAS NOT MADE CLEAR TO THE PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR THE MILLAGE. CLIMATE CHANGE MUST BE ADDRESSED BUT NOT AT THE EXPENSE OF MENTAL HEALTH AND PUBLIC SAFETY. I WALK ON PLATTE ROAD, EVEN MORE SO THAT WE ARE LIVING IN THE MIDST OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. MARIE SHOCKMAN WROTE ABOUT THE WASHINGTON COUNTY POOR HOUSE WHICH DOUBLED AS AN INSANE ASYLUM AND ELECTED IN 1836 OPEN THE SPOT WHERE THE COUNTY RECREATION CENTER NOW STANDS. SHAKMAN NOTED THAT THE POOR HOUSE SHELTERED A DIVERSE GROUP OF UNFORTUNATES IN SAYING ALCOHOLIC PEOPLE AND S SENILE, RETARDED OR JUST DOWN ON THEIR LUCK. THEY HAVE COME A LONG WAY FROM THOSE DAYS BUT SOCIETY CONTINUES TO STRUGGLE. ALTHOUGH CURRENT RESEARCH SHOWS THAT WE COULD PREVENT EXACERBATION OF PSYCHOSIS WITH APPROPRIATE TREATMENT FINDING SUCH TREATMENT IS OFTEN DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE. BACK BEFORE THE OBSERVER PIECE WAS PUBLISHED, BECAME VERY ILL WITH THE SECOND IN A SERIES OF EPISODES OF BIOLOGICAL BRAIN CONDITION OR MENTAL ILLNESS. UNABLE TO ARTICULATE WHAT WAS WRONG, I ACTUALLY WENT TO SEE A PSYCHIATRIST WHO WROTE ME A SCRIPT AND SENT ME BACK OUT ON THE STREET. AND I -- HE HAD NOT ASKED ME THE BASIC FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS SUCH AS DO YOU HAVE A SAFE AND SECURE SHELTER. WHEN DID YOU LAST EAT? DO YOU HAVE MONEY TO LIVE ON? THINGS WE OFTEN TAKE FOR GRANTED. I WAS LUCKY I EVENTUALLY WAS SENT TO A STATE HOSPITAL. THERE'S A LOT MORE TO THIS STORY, BUT I SURVIVED AND RECOVERED MY ABILITY TO FUNCTION. I CAN'T IMAGINE NOT HAVING SAFE SHELTER DURING CURRENT TIMES. THE POOR HOUSES ARE GONE AND STATE HOSPITALS HAVE ALL BUT DISAPPEARED BUT PEOPLE ARE STILL --
01:26:09.139: >> Clerk Beaudry: 13 SECONDS. -- WITHOUT A PLACE TO CALL HOME, EVEN IN ANN ARBOR. I ASK YOU TO DO YOUR PART TO ENSURE THAT THE MINIM MILLAGE ID TO SUPPORT REAL PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES, TO THE CITIZENS WHO WILL RENEW THE MILLAGE. I WILL WORK WITH THE CITIZENS FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND PUBLIC SAFETY TO PROVIDE SPECIFICS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
01:26:34.865: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
01:26:45.242: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER 727, PHONE CALLER 727, DID YOU HAVE A COMMENT?
01:26:51.215: >> NO.
01:26:59.857: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER 849, DID YOU HAVE A COMMENT?
01:27:03.294: >> YES. I DO. THIS IS GLEN NELSON AND I STRONGLY SUPPORT SPENDING THE CITY'S SHARE OF THE COUNTY HEALTH MILLAGE FUNDS ONLY ON SERVICES THAT CLEARLY SUPPORT MENTAL HEALTH AND PUBLIC SAFETY. THIS IS NOT TRUE IN THE PROPOSED BUDGET. IT INCLUDES ABOUT $574,000 FOR REPAIR OF THE BARTON AND SUPERIOR DAMS AND ABOUT 940,000 FOR CLIMATE ACTION. USING COUNTY MILLAGE FUNDS SOLELY FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND PUBLIC SAFETY SERVICES IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR THREE REASONS. FIRST, ACCOUNTABILITY. THIS IS WHAT MOST VOTERS WERE SUPPORTING AS SHOWN BY SCIENTIFIC SURVEYS. SECOND, HELPING ANN ARBOR CITIZENS, COVID-19 AND THE EFFORTS TO CONTAIN IT ARE CAUSING ENORMOUS INSECURITIES AND STRESSES IN OUR COMMUNITY. MILLAGE FUNDS WOULD PROVIDE IMPORTANT HELP, THIRD RENEWAL OF THE MILLAGE USING MILLAGE FUNDS FOR PURPOSES OTHER THAN MENTAL HEALTH AND PUBLIC SAFETY JEOPARDIZES RENEWAL BY REINFORCING THE CYNICISM AND THE STRESS MANY CITIZENS FEEL TOWARDS PUBLIC OFFICIALS. FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN I MENTION TO PEOPLE THAT PROPOSED BUDGET CONTAINS OVER A QUARTER OF A MILLION DOLLARS TO ADD STAFF TO THE ANN ARBOR CITY STAFF, PEOPLE ARE AMAZED THAT -- THAT PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND PUBLIC SAFETY WOULD FIND IN THIS CLIMATE WHERE THE PROBLEMS ARE SO SEVERE THAT THE CITY TAKES IT AND SPENDS IT ON CITY STAFF. I WOULD ADD THAT THE EXPERTS WHO PRESENTED COVID-19 CHALLENGES AND RESPONSES TO COUNCIL ON APRIL 20th PROVIDED EXCELLENT RECOMMENDATIONS, REALLOCATE 1.5 MILLION OF MILLAGE FUNDS TO ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING AND IMPROVE THE LIVES OF MANY ANN ARBOR CITIZENS. THE SHELTER ASSOCIATION, BARRIER BUSTERS, WASHTENAW-COORDINATED FUNDERS, SMALL BUSINESS RESILIENCY AND RELIEF FUND.
01:29:36.914: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
01:29:37.614: >> I WOULD ENCOURAGE ONE OR MORE -- I COURA URGE ONE OR MORU TO OFFER ONE OR MORE AMENDMENTS TO CHANGE THIS BUDGET SO IT SERVES THE PEOPLE OF ANN ARBOR WHO ARE UNDER ENORMOUS STRESS. WE SHOULD BE CELEBRATING THAT THE CITIZENS OF WASHTENAW COUNTY AND ANN ARBOR PASS A MENTAL HEALTH MILLAGE WHICH WOULD ALLOW US TO ADDRESS THE CURRENT PROBLEMS. LET'S DO SOMETHING THAT ALLOWS US TO CELEBRATE THAT.
01:30:11.515: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
01:30:12.349: >> Clerk Beaudry: TIME. MAYOR, THAT'S ALL THE CALLERS ON THE LINE.
01:30:21.825: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SEEING NO ONE FURTHER THIS PUBLIC HEARING IS CLOSED. WE HAVE BEFORE US THE MINUTES OF THE WORK SESSION OF APRIL 13, AND THE REGULAR SESSION MEETING MINUTES OF APRIL 20th, 2020. MAY I HAVE A MOTION TO APPROVE THESE MINUTES MOVED BY ACKERMAN, SECONDED BY LUMM. DISCUSSION OF THE MINUTES? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] ALL OPPOSED?

MOVED BY COUNCIL MEMBER LUMM, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD. DISCUSSION OF B-6? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
01:34:41.885: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES, THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY THAT THIS FALLS ON THE END OF THE REST OF THEM. I THINK IT'S GREAT THAT WE GET THESE LITTLE SLICES. THIS IS MORE THAN A SLICE. THIS IS ACTUALLY 25 ACRES. AND SO IT'S -- IT'S PRETTY EXCITING TO SEE A PIECE THIS BIG GETTING ADDED TO OUR NATURAL AREA. I KNOW THAT OUR THINGS COME WITH, YOU KNOW, SOME KIND OF FUTURE COSTS FOR WHAT MAINTENANCE WE DO IN THESE NATURAL AREAS BUT IT'S COMPLETELY WORTH IT. AND I THINK IT'S ALSO, HAD YOU KNOW, WELL IN KEEPING WITH OUR ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS TO ACCEPT AS MUCH OF THIS SPACE AS POSSIBLE FROM THESE DEVELOPMENTS AND TO ENCOURAGE IN DEVELOPMENTS MOVING FORWARD THAT AS MUCH OF THIS SPACE AS POSSIBLE BE MAINTAINED AND CONTIGUOUS TO THIS SPACE INTO THE ACTUAL DEVELOPMENT AREA. SO I APPRECIATE THAT. WE HAVE THIS PROCESS IN PLACE AND I'M GLAD THAT WE ARE ADDING THIS ACREAGE TO PRESERVE THE PUBLIC LAND SPACE MOVING FORWARD. THANK YOU.
01:35:40.744: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND?
01:35:43.146: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. I JUST WANT TO THANK PARKS STAFF AND GREEN BELT STAFF, SUE COLIN SMITH AND OTHERS FOR HELPING US MOVE TO WITH ALL THE NEW ADDITIONS TO THE SP PARK SYSTEM. WHO WERE REALLY THOUGHTFUL IN THEIR DISCUSSIONS ABOUT ADDING LAND TO THE SYSTEM AND MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN AFFORD TO MAINTAIN IT AND IN KEEPING WITH THEIR PRIORITIES. SO THANKS.
01:36:13.276: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
01:36:14.544: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I TOO WOULD LIKE TO THANK STAFF FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. THESE ARE PROPERTIES THAT WERE DONATE OR PURCHASED AS PART OF PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT OVER MANY YEARS. AND ALL OF THESE WERE EITHER DONATED BY THE -- WELL, THEY WERE ALL DONATED BY THE DEVELOPER IN THE CASE OF HANSEN NATURE AREA. THAT WAS DONATED BY AVALON. THE 25 ACRES AT 3200 GREEN ROAD, WHICH IS PART OF THE BULK WOODS NATURE AREA, THAT WAS PURCHASED BY THE CITY. PART OF THE WOODBURY CLUB APARTMENT AREA. SO IT IS NICE TO OFFICIALLY REZONE THE PUBLIC LAND. THERE ARE CITY PARK LANDS SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD.
01:37:08.565: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSIONS? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] ALL OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. WHICH ONE WAS THAT? B-7. B-7, AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND SECTION 1:156 OF CHAPTER 7 (DOWNTOWN DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY) OF TITLE I OF THE CODE OF THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. MOVED BY RAMLAWI, SECONDED BY COUNCILMAN SMITH. DISCUSSION OF B-7. I HAVE COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
01:37:45.068: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU, MANY MAYOR. WHEN THIS CAME BEFORE US LAST WEEK, I WAS DOWN ON IT FROM 50AMI TO 60 IN THIS CASE AND IN THE INTERIM, I HAD A VERY NICE CONVERSATION WITH JENNIFER HALL, AND AS PART OF ABOUT SIX TOPICS WE TALKED ABOUT, THIS WAS ONE OF THEM. SHE CONVINCED THAT THIS WAS NOT A STEP BACKWARDS BUT A STEP FORWARD TO START TO, YOU KNOW, PUT SOME OF THE DDA FUNDS WHERE THEY ARE DESPE DESPERATELY NEEDD I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS TONIGHT. THANK YOU.
01:38:23.606: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
01:38:25.875: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES, I WOULD JUST -- THANK YOU, MAYOR AND THANKS FOR RUNNING THIS MEETING. I KNOW IT'S GOT TO BE DIFFICULT WITH ALL OF THESE CHALLENGES. BUT I'M GLAD OF MY COLLEAGUE HAS COME AROUND AND SUPPORTED THIS. I KNOW LAST MEETING WAS NOT. IT'S JUST NICE TO SEE THAT DDA IS MOVING IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION. IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S BEEN MOVING RELATIVELY SPEAKING QUICKLY COMPARED TO WHERE IT WAS FIVE OR TEN YEARS AGO WITH AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND WORKFORCE HOUSING. SO I JUST WANT TO GO ON RECORD AND APPRECIATE IT AND ACKNOWLEDGE IT AND HOPEFULLY THERE'S A LOT MORE COMING.
01:39:15.959: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. COUNCILMEMBER EATON?
01:39:19.295: >> Councilmember Eaton: THANK YOU. I VOTED AGAINST THIS OPEN THE FIRST READING. I WILL BE SUPPORTING IT THIS EVENING. MY COLLEAGUE, COUNCILMEMBER LUMM AND COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI HAVE CHANGED MY MIND ON THIS. I THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE DDA SUPPORT OUR AFFORDABILITY GOALS AND I GUESS THIS WILL MAKE THAT MORE LIKELY. THANK YOU.
01:39:42.419: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? I TOO WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS. THE DOWNTOWN DEVELOPMENT ADMINISTRATION, HAS BEEN WORKING IN SUPPORT OF OUR DOWNTOWN BUSINESSES AND THE RESIDENTS IN NEED DOWNTOWN, WHETHER THEY ARE SUPPORTIVE ROOFING HERE AND THERE, SUPPORT IN ANOTHER MANNER TOO, THE DDA HAS FOCUSED ON THIS AND I'M GLAD THAT WE ARE GIVING THEM THE OPPORTUNITY HERE TO ENHANCE THAT. YOU KNOW, WE ARE PUTTING MORE AND MORE RESOURCES AND LANDS TOWARDS THIS PURPOSE. IT'S DESPERATELY NEEDED PURPOSE AND I'M GLAD THAT THE DDA WILL BE CONTRIBUTING AND DOING ITS PART. THANK YOU.
01:40:27.530: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] ALL OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. B-8, AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND CHAPTER 55 (ZONING), REZONING OF 0.20 ACRE FROM C1B (COMMUNITY CONVENIENCE CENTER DISTRICT) TO PUD (PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT), THE GARNET PUD ZONING AND SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS, 325 EAST SUMMIT STREET. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER EATON AND SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN. DISCUSSION OF B-8. COUNCILMEMBER EATON?
01:41:05.335: >> Councilmember Eaton: THANK YOU. WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT WE SHOULD POSTPONE THIS UNTIL THE MAY 18th MEETING WITHOUT COMMENT AND I'M GOING TO FOLLOW THAT ADVICE AND MOVE THAT WE POSTPONE THIS MATTER UNTIL THE SITE PLAN ACCOMPANIES IT IN THE AGENDA ON THE 18th.
01:41:25.955: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE A SECOND? SECONDED BY RAMLAWI. DISCUSSION POSTPONEMENT? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES]
01:41:37.333: >> Mayor Taylor: ALL OPPOSED. IT IS POSTPONED. C-1. AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND SECTION 2:64 OF CHAPTER 29 (SEWER RATES) OF TITLE II OF THE CODE OF THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN. SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI. DISCUSSION OF C-1. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
01:41:57.020: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I RECOGNIZE THAT THIS AGENDA ITEM IS JUST THE SEWER RATES, INCREASES BUT MY COMMENTS COVER ALL THREE PROPOSED INCREASES, SEWER, WATER AND STORMWATER. I HAVE VERY MIXED FEELINGS ON ALL THREE, BUT ESPECIALLY THE WATER RATE INCREASE. I DIDN'T KNOW IF I WOULD SUPPORT THE INCREASES OR NOT AT SECOND READING. AT THE 50,000-FOOT LEVEL, WITH THE REAL ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL CHALLENGES OUR RESIDENTS ARE FACING, I HAVE SERIOUS RESERVATIONS ABOUT APPROVING ANY COST INCREASE TO RESIDENTS AT THIS TIME. PLUS A WEEK FROM TONIGHT AT OUR WORK SESSION, WE ARE GOING TO BE DISCUSSING WHAT I CALL PLAN B ON THE CITY BUDGET AND COST CONTAINMENT ACTIONS LAST MEETING, AND WHAT MR. CRAWFORD HAS NOW LABELED THE CITY'S FINANCIAL RECOVERY PLAN. THAT WILL BE AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT DISCUSSION AND MY EXPECTATION IS THAT IT WOULD INCLUDE THE WATER E UTILITIES AS WELL AS THE GENERAL FUND. I ASKED FOR FISCAL '21 PROJECTS STAFF WOULD RECOMMEND DEFERRING IN EACH OF THE THREE PLANS IF THE RATE INCREASES ARE NOT APPROVED. AND THE ANSWERS TO THAT QUESTION AS WELL AS THE OVERALL ASSESSMENT OF THE COVID-19 IMPACTS ON THE WATER UTILITY FUNDS WILL SHAPE WHETHER I ULTIMATELY SUPPORT THE INCREASE OR NOT. I'M PARTICULARLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE WATER INCREASES BECAUSE THEY ARE ACROSS THE BOARD INCREASES THAT SIMPLY BUILD ON THE MAJOR RATE RESTRUCTURING ADOPTED IN 2018 WHICH I BELIEVE AND STILL BELIEVE IS FLAWED, INAPPROPRIATE, AND UNNECESSARILY PUNITIVE FOR SOME RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS. I TRIED TO CHANGE THAT, BUT IT WASN'T SUPPORTED BY THE MAJORITY OF COUNCIL. ANYWAY, IT'S INTERESTING TO NOTE WHAT HAS TAKEN PLACE SINCE THE RESTRUCTURING. REMEMBER, WE CREATED A FOUR VOLUME BASED TIER OF PRICING FOR RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS WHERE THE COST FOR A GALLON OF WATER IS EIGHT TIMES -- YES, THAT'S EIGHT TIMES THE COST OF A GALLON FOR A LOW RESIDENTIAL USER. WHAT HAS HAPPENED? IN RESPONSE TO MY QUESTION, IT WAS INDICATED THAT, QUOTE, THE CONSUMPTION IN TIER ONE WAS A LITTLE OVER HALF OF WHAT WE EXPECTED, END QUOTE. I'M NOT SURE HOW WE COULD HAVE EXPECTED ANYTHING OTHER THAN A PRECIPITOUS DROP IN USE WHEN RATES ARE JACKED UP THAT HIGH, BUT APPARENTLY WE DID. THE RATES WERE RAISED DRAMATICALLY. THE THIRD TIER OF RESIDENTIAL AND WATER ONLY USERS, THE VOLUME DROPPED BY MORE THAN WHAT WAS EXPECTED. WHY DO I BRING THIS UP? TWO REASONS, ACTUALLY. FIRST, TO REMIND EVERYONE THAT, QUOTE, COST OF SERVICE, END QUOTE, IS NOTHING MORE THAN A SET OF ASSUMPTIONS RUN IN A BIG MODEL BY A HIGHLY PAID CONSULTANT. IF YOU GET AT ASSUMPTIONS WRONG, THE OUTPUTS AND THE CONCLUSIONS ARE CALLED IN QUESTION. SECOND, AND IMPORTANTLY FROM THE CITY'S PERSPECTIVE, WATER REVENUES ARE LESS THAN EXPECTED PECTEDAND WE WILL NEED TO DEAL H THAT ON TOP OF THE COVID-19 REVENUE HITS. SO FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS I'M VERY RELUCTANT TO BUILD ON THE WATER RATE STRUCTURE WE HAVE AND COMPOUNDING THE ISSUES. HAVING SAID THAT, I DO BELIEVE THAT INVESTING IN THE WATER AND SEWER INFRASTRUCTURE MUST BE A PRIORITY AND I RECOGNIZE THAT THAT TAKES MONEY. THAT'S THE DILEMMA. HOW MUCH ADDITIONAL REVENUE IS REQUIRES FOR INFRASTRUCTURE REINVESTMENT IS NOT CLEAR, WHICH IS WHY I NEED THE INFORMATION THAT WE'LL PRESUMABLY GET NEXT WEEK BEFORE DECIDING HOW I WILL ULTIMATELY VOTE ON THESE INCREASES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR LISTENING.
01:45:49.218: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
01:45:51.988: >> Councilmember Hayner: WELL, I HAVE TO SAY THAT COUNCILMEMBER LUMM HAS SUMMED UP ADMIRABLY MY FEELINGS ON THIS MATTER. I'M INTERESTED TO SEE WHAT THE EFFECTS ARE GOING TO BE, ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THE DRAMATIC DECREASE IN VOLUME THAT WE ARE EXPERIENCING FROM THE UNIVERSITY. AND I ASSUME A DRAMATIC INCREASE IN VOLUME AND THEREFORE REVENUE TO THE WATER SYSTEM. AND I THINK THAT WHEN WE SCALE OUR WATER SYSTEM TO SUPPLY A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF DEMAND FROM A UNIVERSITY AS AN EXAMPLE OF A USER, THEN -- AND THEY ARE NOT THERE TO PAY FOR THAT DEMAND WITH THEIR ACTUAL USE, WE HAVE A PROBLEM. AND, YOU KNOW, DOUBLING OUR WATER RATES OVER SEVEN YEARS IS NOT GOING TO SOLVE THAT PROBLEM. I'M SORRY TO SAY I'M NOT GOING TO SUPPORT THIS. THAT'S ALL. THANK YOU.
01:46:49.812: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
01:46:51.113: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES. I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT EQUITY IN THE COST OF WATER AND WHY SOME PEOPLE WILL BE PAYING EIGHT TIMES AS MUCH FOR A GALLON OF WATER AND I WOULD LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THAT GENERALLY AND THEN GIVE AN EXAMPLE. AS THE ECONOMY CONTINUES SPIRAL DOWNWARD, I BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO START LIVING WITH FRIENDS AND SO WE ARE GOING TO BE PAYING EIGHT TIMES AS MUCH FOR THE WATER WHEN WE OPEN OUR HOME UP TO A FRIEND, IF THAT MOVES US TO THE FOURTH TIER. I RIGHT NOW HAVE A FAMILY FROM MOROCCO THAT LIVES WITH MY HUSBAND AND ME. THEY HAVE A RELATIVE, A 15-YEAR-OLD, WHO IS IN THIS COUNTRY RIGHT NOW, WAS ATTENDING SCHOOL. BECAUSE OF THE TRAVEL BAN, HE CANNOT GET BACK TO MOROCCO. SO HE MAY COME AND STAY WITH US. I WILL PROBABLY BE PAYING EIGHT TIMES AS MUCH FOR HIS WATER. MY DAUGHTER LIVES IN SAN FRANCISCO. SHE MAY BE COMING BACK TO STAY DURING THE SUMMER BECAUSE SHE REALLY THERE WANTS TO GET OUT OF SAN FRANCISCO WHERE THERE ISN'T MUCH SPACE FOR SOCIAL DISTANCING. SO HER AND HER BOYFRIEND MAY BE COMING HERE, AGAIN, I WILL BE PAYING EIGHT TIMES AS MUCH FOR WATER. AT THE SAME TIME, I HAVE PLENTY OF SPACE IN MY HOME. I WANT TO BE WELCOMING TO PEOPLE, BUT I JUST THINK THAT IT'S A PROBLEM. IT'S NOT JUST A PROBLEM FOR ME, BUT ALSO FOR PEOPLE LIVING CLOSE TO THE POVERTY LINE. ARE THEY GOING TO HAVE THAT DISINCENTIVE TO TRY TO SHARE THEIR HOUSING AND IS THAT CONGOINGTO CONTRIBUTE TO MORE HS PEOPLE AND SUFFERING IF WE ARE ASKING PEOPLE TO PAY EIGHT TIMES MORE FOR THE WATER OF A FRIEND?
01:48:48.297: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
01:48:50.499: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. I WON'T BE TALKING ABOUT WATER. I WILL WAIT UNTIL THAT. COULDS UP NEXT. I JUST WANT TO  TO TALK ABOUT S. THAT DOESN'T TROUBLE ME AS MUCH AS THE WATER RATES DO. IT'S A CONSTANT CHARGE BASED ON USAGE. SO IT DOESN'T -- TO ME, IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S A PRETTY -- IT'S AN EVEN SITUATION FOR ALL USERS. THERE'S NO PICKING WINNERS AND LOSERS AND FUDGING THINGS TO MAKE OUR ARGUMENTS SEEM LOGICAL. THIS IS PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD IN MY OPINION, UNLESS I'M MISSING SOMETHING. YOU KNOW, I HAD -- I HAVE BEEN WORKING HERE THROUGH THIS COVID CRISIS. ON SATURDAY, IT WAS A CRAZY DAY, AND TO END MATTERS, WE HAD A BLOCKED LINE HERE, AND, YOU KNOW, THINGS WERE COMING UP THROUGH THE FLOOR DRAINS AND IT WAS JUST A HOT MESS. AND I WILL JUST TELL YOU FOLKS THAT -- I DON'T THINK PEOPLE REALLY VALUE FIRST WORLD CONDITIONS. IT'S NOT PLEASANT WHEN YOU HAVE SEWAGE COMING UP BECAUSE OF FAULTY INFRASTRUCTURE. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN OUR INFRASTRUCTURE. UNFORTUNATELY, WE DIDN'T DO IT DURING THE '80s AND '90s AND NOW WE ARE STUCK PLAYING CATCHUP AND LIKE A LOT OF EVERYTHING ELSE, PRIOR GENERATIONS HAVE PUT THE COST AND THE FUTURE GENERATIONS WILL BE ASKED TO PAY. I THINK THIS IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THAT. IT'S UNFORTUNATE. THAT'S THE REALITY, BUT THAT'S A HEAVY PRICE TO PAY.
01:50:46.115: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS RATE INCREASE. THE STAFF HAS PUT TOGETHER A PLAN AND I GUESS WE WILL TALK MORE ABOUT THIS LATER. PERHAPS IT'S WATER RATE BUT WITH RESPECT TO SEWER, CERTAINLY WE ARE OBVIOUSLY PAYING A GREAT DEAL OF ATTENTION WITH RESPECT TO OUR WASTEWATER SYSTEM, THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM, THE SYSTEM THAT REMOVES WASTE AND BRINGS IT TO THE TREATMENT PLANT. IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE INVEST IN IT, AND WE MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY AND THE RESOURCES TO FIX PROBLEMS AS THEY ARISE TO MAKE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS SO THAT, YOU KNOW, FUTURE GENERATIONS CAN ENJOY THE SYSTEM AS WE HAVE ENJOYED THE SYSTEM CREATED BY OTHERS. THAT'S PART OF OUR DUTY AND PART OF OUR DUTY IS TO PAY FOR IT. FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
01:51:41.370: >> Councilmember Nelson:  YES.
01:51:47.576: >> Councilmember Smith: YES.
01:51:48.177: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES.
01:51:53.215: >> Councilmember Hayner:  NO.
01:51:53.983: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES.
01:51:58.254: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES.
01:52:06.762: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES.
01:52:07.530: >> Councilmember Grand: YES.
01:52:08.130: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES.
01:52:13.002: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
01:52:14.503: >> Councilmember Eaton: YES.
01:52:15.104: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION CARRIES.
01:52:19.241: >> Mayor Taylor: C-2, AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND SECTION 2:63 OF CHAPTER 29 (WATER RATES) OF TITLE II OF THE CODE OF THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI. SECONDED BY COUNCILMAN SMITH. DISCUSSION, PLEASE, OF C-2. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
01:52:38.861: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES. THANK YOU. THIS ONE IS DEFINITELY ONE THAT I CONTINUE TO HAVE STRUGGLES WITH. I HAD STRUGGLES EVER SINCE JOINING COUNCIL WITH IT. FRANKLY, I'M A BUSINESSMAN, A BUSINESSPERSON OF ALMOST 30 YEARS, AND IT STILL DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME. I HAVE HAD DOZENS OF HOURS HAVING IT EXPLAINS TO ME. IT'S STILL NOT REGISTERING WITH ME. I THINK WE HAVE A FAULTY SYSTEM, A FAULTY RATE FOR ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT TIERS. THEY ARE RATHER ARBITRARY. YOU CAN MOVE THEM AROUND ALL YOU WANT AND IT CAN STILL BE DEFENSIBLE. SO I UNDERSTAND THE NEED TO, AGAIN, INVEST IN OUR INFRASTRUCTURE. SO IT'S THERE FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS AND UNFORTUNATELY, IT HAS NOT BEEN DONE BY PRIOR GENERATIONS. THE LAST GENERATION OF FOLKS FAILED TO DO WHAT THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE AND HAVE LEFT IT FOR US TO MAKE UP FOR IT, BUT WE ARE ADDING COSTS TO THE WRONG PARTS OF THE SYSTEM. PARTS OF THE SYSTEM ARE SUBSIDIZING OTHER PARTS OF THE SYSTEM. AND I WILL CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT EVEN IF I DO SUPPORT IT. AND I WILL JUST CAUTION I UNDERSTAND -- I THINK WHAT COUNCILMEMBER LUMM IS ASKING STAFF ABOUT, WATER RATE USAGE AND THE FACT THAT WE HAVE SEEN SOME DROPS LAST YEAR. I DO APPRECIATE THAT AND SOME OF IT MAY HAVE BEEN DUE TO PEOPLE USING LESS BECAUSE OF THE FINANCIAL IMPACT, BUT I ALSO WANT TO SEE A LONGER RANGE OF USAGE OR DECLINE OR INCREASES, THAT IS, TO MAKE THESE KIND OF LARGER POLICY DECISIONS. I WILL NOTE LAST YEAR WAS AN EXCEPTIONALLY WET YEAR AND I'M NOT SURE IF THAT PLAYED INTO CONSUMPTION FIGURES BASED ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS. SO THOSE DEFINITELY NEED TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT AS WE LOOK AT USAGE AND WHAT KIND OF CONDITIONS WE HAVE WITH RESPECT TO PRESCRIPTION. I HAVE A REALLY STRONG PROBLEM. THAT'S WHAT I SAID LAST YEAR, IS DECREASING RATES THAT ARE BASED ON A FAULTY PHILOSOPHY.
01:55:05.774: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
01:55:07.476: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. YEAH, JUST SO SPEAKING OF THESE RATE RAISES, SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW THAT WHEN THIS -- WHEN THEY FIRST STARTED TELLING US TO WASH OUR HANDS MORE, BA BEING IN FEBRUARY -- BACK IN FEBRUARY, I CONSIDERED BRINGING FORWARD, A RESOLUTION TO DISCOUNT THE FOUR TIERS OF RESIDENTIAL USE WERE. I WAS GOING TO DISCOUNT EVERYBODY'S BILL $10 AND EVERY METERS $10 SO THAT PEOPLE WOULDN'T BE SWEATING OVER EVEN ANOTHER 700 GALLONS A QUARTER AND HAVE THEM GO UP IN THE $8 CCF RANGE. AND SO THIS IS -- RAISING THESE RATES NOW IS THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF WHAT MY INTENTION WAS IN THIS TIME, WHEN PEOPLE ARE FINANCIALLY CHALLENGED AND I KNOW THAT INCLUDES THE CITY, BUT, YOU KNOW, IT WAS SHOCKING THAT THE $10-METER WORKED OUT TO $300,000 REVENUE LOSS IN OUR SYSTEM. AND SO THESE TINY CHANGES ARE BIG NUMBERS ON OUR END. AND I THINK WE CAN SHAVE THESE A LITTLE BIT MORE AND IT'S NOT DOUBTING WHAT THE SYSTEM -- WHAT THE STAFF IS SAYING THE NEEDS ARE. I'M JUST CONCERNED THAT I JUST CAN'T GET OVER THIS NOTION THAT WE'RE BASICALLY ON THIS PATH TO DOUBLE -- HAVE DOUBLED OUR WATER RATES OVER NINE YEARS. AND I JUST -- IT'S SHOCKING TO ME THAT THE DEMAND FOR -- SINCE WE'RE BASING IT ON A COST SERVICE MODEL, THAT THE COST OF PROVIDING THESE SERVICES ARE DOUBLING AND SO I THINK THERE'S ONE OF THE PLACES WHERE BASING THIS ON A COST OF SERVICE MODEL, THE FLAWS COME TO THE SURFACE OF THAT MODEL, THAT WHEN WE START POURING IN THESE CAPITAL NEEDS, IT JUST -- IT'S NOT -- IT'S NOT ADDING UP. AND SO I JUST -- I CAN'T SUPPORT THESE RAISES. IT'S THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF WHAT I FEEL WE SHOULD BE DOING NOW AND I'M ALL FOR WATER CONSERVATION AND I'M GLAD WE SHOWED LESS WATER USE IN THE LAST COUPLE OF QUARTERS. I DOUBT THAT WILL BE THE CASE MOVING FORWARD. I MEAN, THIS IS FIRST MONTH -- FIRST QUARTER I JUST GOT MY BILL. THIS IS FIRST TIME WE HAVE BEEN OVER 17 IN YEARS FOR A FAMILY OF FOUR, AND WE DON'T DO ANY LAWN WATERING OR ANY GARDEN WATERING OR ANY OF THAT. AND SO WE HAVE DEFINITELY HAD MUCH MORE USE WITH HAND WASHING AND LAUNDERING AND THINGS LIKE THAT. I WAS UP INTO THAT SECOND TIER THIS TIME FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER IN YEARS, AND IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU ARE OUT OF WORK. AND SO I JUST -- I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS PROGRESS TOWARDS DOUBLING OUR RATES IN NINE YEARS. I JUST CAN'T SUPPORT IT TONIGHT.
01:57:47.136: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
01:57:48.637: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES, MR. MAYOR. I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING THIS AT FIRST READING. I DID SUPPORT THIS SEWER RATE AT FIRST READING, AND I WILL SUPPORT THE STORMWATER AT THE FIRST, BUT I'M NOT THEN INDICATING THAT I WILL ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT THESE, AS I SAID INITIALLY AT THE SECOND READING. AND I AM AGAIN LOOKING FORWARD TO THE RESPONSES OF ONE OF MY QUESTIONS TO LEARN MORE WHAT STAFF WOULD RECOMMEND IN THESE THREE FUNDS IF THE RATE INCREASES AREN'T APPROVED AND, AGAIN, THE OVERALL ASSESSMENT ON THE COVID-19 IMPACT ON THE WATER UTILITY FUNDS. THAT'S -- IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE UNDERSTAND THAT, I BELIEVE. THE -- SO THIS IS A 6.5% ACROSS THE BOARD INCREASE. THE PROBLEM, THE BIGGER PROBLEM IS THAT WE, YOU KNOW -- WE HAVE NOT REVISITED THIS SINCE THIS WAS INITIALLY -- SINCE THE CHANGE IN THE RATE STRUCTURE WAS BROUGHT TO US. AND THAT, TO ME, IS REALLY THE BIGGER ISSUE AND PROBLEM AND THAT DOES NEED TO BE REVISITED, I THINK. I -- YOU KNOW, AGAIN, THE TIER STRUCTURE FOR RESIDENTIAL, WHERE YOU ARE CHARGING SO MUCH MORE PER CCF, TO RESIDENTS AND IT WAS A COST SHIFT. SO, I MEAN, AGAIN, YOU JUST LOOK AT THE CLASSES THAT WE CREATED FOR MULTIFAMILY COMMERCIAL AND THEN THOSE TIERED CATEGORIES, MULTIFAMILY AND SPECIAL DON'T HAVE TIERS. WE HAVE THESE FOUR TIERS FOR RESIDENTIAL AND WE ARE CHARGING -- SO IN ESSENCE, WE ARE CHARGING SIGNIFICANTLY MORE TO ANYONE WHO FALLS INTO TIER 3 AND TIER 4. THAT'S A LOT OF FOLKS. LOOK AT WHAT OCCURRED. I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING THIS SEASON AND I -- I HOPE THAT THE INFORMATION THAT WILL BE FORTHCOMING WILL BE HELPFUL TO US ALL. THANK YOU.
02:00:08.844: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
02:00:09.778: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. THANK YOU TO STAFF FOR PUTTING THIS PLAN FORWARD AND TO COLLEAGUES FOR THEIR CONSIDERATION. YOU KNOW, OF ALL THE VARIOUS IMPORTANT RESPONSIBILITIES WE HAVE AS A MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT AND AS A CITY COUNCIL, CLEAN WATER IS UP THERE AT THE TOP. AND NOW MORE THAN EVER, AS PEOPLE'S LIFESTYLES ARE CHANGING, AS THEIR TIME SPENT AT HOME IS CHANGING, I THINK THAT'S UNDERSCORED THAT WHEN THERE'S UNCERTAINTY IN THE WORLD, THEY NEED TO KNOW THAT WATER IS SAFE. AND I THINK WHEN IT COMES TO -- TO HOW THEY PAY FOR IT, OF COURSE, WE MUST SPEND OUR DOLLARS RESPONSIBLY, BUT I THINK IN THE CASE OF THIS KIND OF CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE, THE CONSERVATIVE AND RESPONSIBLE THING TO DO IS TO RUN THE RISK OF RAISING RATES TOO MUCH, EVEN IF BY A SMALL AMOUNT. AND I DON'T KNOW -- I DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S THE CASE HERE. I BELIEVE THESE ARE RESPONSIBLE INCREASES. BUT I THINK INCREASES NONETHELESS THAT NEED TO BE MADE. SO I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS FOR STAFF. I THINK MR. HUPY, PERHAPS FOR YOU. THE FIRST IS WITH RESPECT TO THE IDEA OF SUBSIDY, IT WAS ASSERTED THAT THE SHIFT IN WATER RATES REFLECT OR CREATED A SUBSIDY IN WHICH SINGLE FAMILY HOMES THAT USE A LOT OF WATER NOW SUBSIDIZE WATER FOR OTHER RESIDENTS. IT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT WHEN WE REMODELED THESE WATER RATES, THE ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT FOR YEARS, MULTIFAMILY -- SO APARTMENTS HAD, IN FACT, BEEN SUBSIDIZING AND PAYING A HIGHER RATE THAN NECESSARY, AND COVERING THE -- THE LOSSES INCURRED BY SINGLE FAMILY HOMES AS A WHOLE. AND THAT AS ONE OF THE READJUSTMENTS, WE BALANCED THAT OUT, AND THEN LOOKED TO CREATE CLASSES WITHIN THE SINGLE FAMILY HOMES THAT BETTER REFLECT THE EXPENSE OF DELIVERING WATER FROM EXTRACTION FROM BARTON POND THROUGH THE WATER TREATMENT PLANT, THROUGH THE PIPES THAT RUN UNDERNEATH THE TREATS AND THEN DELIVER TO EACH SINGLE FAMILY SEPARATELY AS TO A WHOLE APARTMENT BUILDING. IS THAT A FAIR REPRESENTATION OF THE UPDATE AND WOULD YOU -- I MEAN, WOULD IT BE FAIR TO SAY THAT NO CLASS OF CUSTOMERS, SO SINGLE FAMILY VERSUS MULTIFAMILY, VERSUS SPECIAL, SUBSIDIZES THE OTHER AT THIS POINT?
02:02:47.969: >> THAT IS A FAIR ASSESSMENT WHEN THE RATE STUDY WAS DONE, THE BASIS OF THE RATE STUDY WAS THAT EACH CLASS OF USER PAID FOR THE EXPENSES THAT THAT CLASS OF USER CREATED. AND TO THE POINT OF THE COMMERCIAL NOT HAVING AN APPARENT TIER STRUCTURE, THEY PAY THEIR PEAKING THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE CLASS. THE PEAKING -- THE PEAKING COST ON NONRESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS IS PAID BY THAT CLASS. SO THEY ARE PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE AS THEY USE LARGER APARTMENTS ON PEAK.
02:03:41.723: >> Councilmember Ackerman: AND TO CLARIFY. EVEN THOUGH YOU USE LESS WATER IN JANUARY THAN JULY, IT HAS TO BE BUILT BIGGER THAN THE AVERAGE NEED IS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR?
02:03:53.735: >> CORRECT.
02:03:54.069: >> Councilmember Ackerman: OKAY. AWESOME. THANK YOU. THE SECOND QUESTION I HAD, JUST QUICKLY, IF I COULD. I BELIEVE COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD'S POINT ABOUT THE CHANGING DYNAMICS OF HOW WE ARE LIVING TODAY, AND I WAS WONDERING -- YOU KNOW, I THINK SOME OF THOSE CHANGES ARE PREDICTABLE, LIKE WHAT HAPPENS IF U OF M DOESN'T HAVE FOOTBALL SEASON? OR DOESN'T MOVE STUDENTS INTO THEIR DORMS? BUT SOME OF THEM ARE LESS PREDICTABLE LIKE THE DYNAMICS THAT COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD MENTIONED WHAT OPPORTUNITIES WILL WE HAVE LOOKING OUT INTO THE SUMMER AND THE FALL TO KIND OF EVALUATE OUR MODELS AND KIND OF THINK ON OUR FEET AS NEEDED TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE BEING TREATED EQUITABLY?
02:04:38.246: >> WE ARE ALREADY LOOKING AT THAT. ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT STAFF HAS BEEN LOOKING AT IS THROUGH COVID, ARE WE SEEING RESIDENTIAL ACCOUNTS MOVING OUT OF TIERS AND UPWARDS? IS THAT OCCURRING? YES. HAVE WE SEEN A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF THAT OCCUR? I'M GOING TO ASK LYNN CHIMOWITZ WHO HAS BEEN LOOKING AT THAT TO COMMENT. AS OF TWO AND A HALF WEEKS AGO, THREE WEEKS AGO WHEN WE WERE LOOKING AT, IT WE HAD NOT YET SEEN THAT SHIFT, BUT LYNNE MIGHT HAVE MORE INFORMATION ON IT THAN I HAVE RIGHT NOW. LYNNE?
02:05:19.421: >> YES, SO BASED ON THE TWO BILLING CYCLES THAT WE HAVE SEEN, WE HAVE NOT SEEN SIGNIFICANT SHIFTS FROM CUSTOMERS MOVING FROM TIER 2, INTO TIER 3 AND 4. THAT BEING SAID, WE DON'T HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF DATA YET ON THE BILLS BUT WE HAVE NOT SEEN THAT YET, BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT.
02:05:41.476: >> Councilmember Ackerman: OKAY. I APPRECIATE THAT PROACTIVE ANALYSIS AND IF THE DATA DOES SAY ANYTHING IN THE FUTURE, I THINK -- I HOPE I SPEAK FOR ALL OF US IN SAYING WE WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THAT AND KNOW HOW WE CAN HELP.
02:05:52.654: >> WELL, WE WOULD COME BACK.
02:05:53.421: >> Councilmember Ackerman: OKAY.
02:05:55.757: >> AND WHAT COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI SAID, WITH A WET SUMMER, WE WOULD EXPECT A DROPOFF TO BE IN TIER 4 AND TIER 3, BECAUSE OF THAT, BECAUSE THAT'S GENERALLY AN IRRIGATION TIER. AND WITH A WET SUMMER, THAT'S WHAT WE WOULD HAVE SEEN LIKE WE SAW LAST YEAR.
02:06:20.215: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND?
02:06:22.884: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS. I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN, THAT NOW MORE THAN EVER, THE ART DECO PIECES OF THE WATER TREATMENT PLANT ARE LOVELY TO LOOK AT, THEY ARE A STRONG REMINDER OF INVESTMENTS THAT HAVEN'T BEEN MADE AND NEED TO BE MADE TO PROTECT THE SAFETY OF OUR DRINKING WATER. I DO THINK FROM AN EQUITY PERSPECTIVE, THAT THIS MOVE TO NO LONGER HAVE MULTIFAMILY BE SUBSIDIZING SINGLE FAMILY HOMES WAS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AND PART OF THE REASON WHY NOT ONE BUT TWO STUDIES THAT WE HAD THAT CAME BACK FROM EXPERTS TOLD US THAT THIS IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. A QUESTION FOR STAFF THAT I THINK IS COVID RELEVANT, BECAUSE I DO WANT -- I DON'T WANT TO MAKE THE MISTAKES OF PAST COUNCILS DURING TIMES OF ECONOMIC DOWNTURN ON UNCERTAINTY, WHERE THEY BACKED OFF OF MAKING THESE NECESSARY INVESTMENTS WHICH NOW WE ARE PAYING FOR WITH THE LARGER INCREASES AND AS WE SEE WITH ALL THREE SEWER, WATER AND STORMWATER. WHAT HAPPENS IF SOMEONE LOSES THEIR JOB, IF THEY HAVE AN INABILITY TO PAY THEIR WATER WAX WHAT TYPE OF PROGRAMS DO WE HAVE AT THE CITY TO HELP THEM OUT?
02:07:45.600: >> I'M GOING TO DEFER AGAIN TO LYNNE WHO WORKS WITH BARRIER BUSTERS WHICH IS ONE OF THE GROUPS THAT THE LAST -- WHEN THE SPEAKER SPOKE AT THE LAST COUNCIL MEETING, THAT THEY TOUTED AS A VERY EFFECTIVE PROGRAM. LYNNE?
02:08:01.349: >> YES, SO WE HAVE A DONATION OPTION ON ALL OF THE WATER BILLS THAT GOES DIRECTLY TO THE COUNTY, WHO ADMINISTERS THE BARRIER BUSTER PROGRAMS. SO PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO USE THIS IN A TIME OF CRISIS. THEY CONTACT THE COUNTY AND THE COUNTY DOES THE VETTING FOR THEM, FOR THE BARRIER BUSTERS PROGRAM. SO THAT'S FOR FOLKS WHO ARE IN A CRISIS SITUATION. AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE NOT BEEN DOING THE SHUT OFFS AS WE NORMALLY HAVE DURING THIS CRISIS. AND THAT IS SORT OF STATEWIDE.
02:08:40.421: >> Councilmember Grand: GREAT. THANK YOU.
02:08:43.124: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
02:08:49.364: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU, M MR. MAYOR. A COUPLE OF THINGS. FIRST, WHAT IS BEFORE US IS AN APPROVAL OF THE 6.5% WATER RATE INCREASE. THE RESTRUCTURING IS NOT -- YOU CAN MAKE COMMENTS ABOUT IT AND I'M GUILTY AS WELL. I CAN QUICKLY ADDRESS A COUPLE OF THINGS. FIRST, THIS IMPLICATION THAT RESTRUCTURING WAS NECESSARY SO THAT WE COULD INVEST IN OUR INFRASTRUCTURE IS VERY MISLEADING. WHY IS IT MISLEADING? IT'S MISLEADING BECAUSE THE RESTRUCTURE IS A CLASS THEFT. SHIFT.THE CLASS SHIFT WAS TO RESIDENTIAL USERS. SECONDLY, THE SUBMETER. SO ALL ALONG THIS HAVE BEEN MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS SUBSIDY ISSUE. AND BECAUSE IT'S -- WE WERE TOLD, IN FACT, THAT WE COULD NOT -- I ASKED PLENTY OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THE USAGE FOR COMMERCIAL PROPERTY, UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, MULTIFAMILY, AND THE ANSWERS WERE NOT -- WERE NOT CLEAR, IN TERMS OF ANSWERING THIS SUBSIDY QUESTION. AGAIN, MULTIPLE COMPANIES ARE NOT SUBMETERS AND SO IT'S HARD TO DETERMINE WHO -- LIKE THE UNIT AND THE MULTIFAMILY UNIT USAGE. AND I JUST WANT A COUPLE OF ANECDOTAL ANSWERS. I HAD  HEAR FROM FOLKS WHO WILLT TO A NICE MULTIFAMILY CONDO APARTMENT COMPLEX, YOU KNOW, IN A NEAR NEIGHBORHOOD THAT HAS A LARGE SWIMMING POOL. AND THEY OFTEN ASK, SO THEY HAVE THAT COST. YOU KNOW, THEY ARE FILLING A SWIMMING POOL. THEN MY COST IS WHY, THE WHY COST IS BEING SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER, AGAIN DUE TO THESE TIERS. THEY QUESTION THAT. AND THEN WHY IS IT MORE EXPENSIVE TO DELIVER THAT WATER TO THEIR HOUSE VERSUS SWIMMING UP THAT SWIMMING POOL ACROSS THE STREET? IT'S HARD TO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS. AND SO THE MEN JUSTIFICATIONS FOR THIS STRUCTURE -- QUITE FRANKLY. I HOPE AT SOME POINT WE REVISIT THIS BECAUSE IT'S CAUSING HARDSHIP FOR A LOT OF FOLKS. THE HARDSHIP WAS NEVER FAIR IN MY VIEW. THANKS.
02:11:39.600: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI? YOU ARE MUTING, COUNCILMEMBER.
02:11:48.676: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: SORRY ABOUT THAT. THANK YOU.
02:11:51.913: >> Mayor Taylor: NO WORRIES.
02:11:53.781: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: STAFF HAD INDICATED THAT THEY HAD INFORMATION ON THE LAST TWO BILLING CYCLES. WHAT MONTHS ARE WE COVERING? ARE ALL CUSTOMERS ON THE SAME BILLING CYCLE? OR IS IT ALL AGGREGATED?
02:12:06.494: >> I'M GOING TO LET LYNNE ANSWER THAT.
02:12:08.563: >> OKAY. SO WE HAVE 12 DIFFERENT BILLING DISTRICTS. SO THEY ARE TAGGERED. SO WE BILL -- THEY ARE STAGGERED. WE BILL ONE BILLING DISTRICT PER WEEK, ESSENTIALLY. SO WE BILL QUARTERLY. WE HAVE TWO BILLING CYCLES GO OUT DURING THIS COVID TIME FRAME.
02:12:30.385: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: WHAT DO YOU THINK WE WILL HAVE RELIABLE INFORMATION TO LOOK AT TO SEE WHAT THE IMPACT OF THIS IS THROUGHOUT THOSE 12 BILLING GROUPS? WE WOULD HAVE ALL THE BILLING DISTRICTS IN ESSENTIALLY NINE MONTHS -- OR NOT -- SORRY, NINE WEEKS. WE WOULD HAVE ALL OF THEM ASSOCIATED. RIGHT NOW ALL THE ANALYSIS THAT WE ARE DOING IS BASED ON CONSUMPTION BECAUSE WE CAN PULL THAT READILY, BUT NOT BILLS, BECAUSE THE BILLS SPAN THE THREE MONTHS.
02:13:05.820: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  AND CAN WE JUST LOOK AT CONSUMPTION RATHER THAN WAITING FOR THE BILL TO BE SENT? I MEAN, CAN WE JUST BE LOOKING AT REALTIME INFORMATION, REALTIME DATA?
02:13:21.803: >> IT WOULD NOT CAPTURE, LIKE, WHAT THE MAXIMUM TIER THAT EACH CUSTOMER IS IN BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE CONSUMPTION FOR THE FULL THREE-MONTH PERIOD, BUT WE CAN LOOK AT CONSUMPTION FOR SOME OTHER THINGS SUCH AS WHAT WE WOULD EXPECT TO SEE AS FAR AS BILL DICREASES.
02:13:40.688: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YEAH, IF IT'S POSSIBLE, IF WE CAN GET WHAT REALTIME INFORMATION IS GOING ON, THIS IS A VERY FLUID SITUATION AND I THINK FOR US, IT'S IMPORTANT TO GET THAT. I THINK MORE INFORMATION LATER WHEN IT'S AVAILABLE WOULD BE GREAT, BUT I THINK WE CAN DRAW ENOUGH FROM THE USAGE WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT TIER IT IS, TO HAVE SOME SORT OF LEADING INDICATOR AS TO WHERE WE ARE GOING WITH THIS. I JUST DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE WAITING TWO AND A HALF MONTHS BEFORE KNOWING WHERE WE ARE GOING WITH THIS. I THINK WE CAN KIND OF GET A CLUE ONCE WE SEE THE USAGE BASED ON LAST YEAR'S NUMBERS, ESPECIALLY FOR THIS TIME OF THE YEAR. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. THERE HASN'T BEEN ANY IRRIGATION. SO IT WOULD BE GOOD TO SEE SOME REAL CLEAN NON-IRRIGATION DATA BEING DELEVER DELIVERED TO US SN TEASE THAT PART OUT OF IT. BECAUSE THAT'S A PART THAT I DON'T BUY. YOU KNOW, I WILL PROBABLY NEVER BUY. SECONDLY, THE -- THE SECOND STUDY THAT WE CONDUCTED ABOUT THE RATE SYSTEM AND THE CHARGES WAS -- WAS DONE UNDER THE DIRECTION OF NEW COUNCIL. I SHOULDN'T SAY NEW COUNCIL BUT THE COUNCIL THAT TOOK OFFICE IN 2018. GAVE US AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE CURRENT SITUATION. SO THE SECOND STUDY DID NOT REAFFIRM ALL THE CONCLUSIONS OF THE FIRST STUDY. SO I WOULD JUST PUSH BACK AND SAY WE HAD A SECOND STUDY. IN FACT, THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE. WE HAVE DIFFERENT OPTIONS AND WE HAVE ROOM TO WORK WITHIN AND SOME DISCRETION. DISCRETION THAT WE'RE NOT -- WE'RE NOT EXERCISING, AND I WILL JUST SAY THIS TO STAFF AND OTHERS THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE A POINT WHERE THESE RATE INCREASES DON'T GET APPROVED BECAUSE OF THE FLAWED TIERED SYSTEM. AND I DON'T WANT TO PLAY CHICKEN WITH OUR INFRASTRUCTURE, BUT THERE'S GOING TO BECOME A POINT WHERE YOU AIN'T GOING TO GET THE SUPPORT. IT'S FACT. SO THERE'S ONLY SO MANY TIMES YOU WILL HOLD YOUR NOSE AND VOTE YES. WE NEED TO CLEAN THIS UP. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, TO ALL THE WORK AND EXPLANATION THAT'S GONE INTO IT, I'M NOT BUYING IT. THANK YOU.
02:16:11.806: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
02:16:13.174: >> Councilmember Hayner: YEAH, THANKS, MANY MAYOR. TWO THINGS TO ADD REAL QUICK TO THIS CONVERSATION. ONE, WHEN WE DO THESE COST OF SERVICE STUDIES AN WE SAY WE DON'T HAVE THE GRANULARITY TO KNOW HOW MANY, SAY, PEOPLE LIVE IN APARTMENT, HOW MANY PEOPLE LIVE IN A HOUSE AND WE ARE BASING THIS COST OF SERVICE ON A METER TIME. WE ARE NOT BASING IT ON PER CAPITA USE AND SO THIS NOTION THAT THERE'S SOME -- IT'S ALMOST LIKE A MAGICAL THINKING NOTION THAT SOMEBODY IN AN APARTMENT MYSTERIOUS USES LESS WATER BY THE NATURE THEY LIVE IN AN APARTMENT, VERSUS LIVING IN A HOME. UNTIL WE HAVE PER CAPITA GRANULARITY ON WATER CONSUMPTION, WE HAVE NO CLUE THAT THAT'S ACCURATE. AND SO I JUST -- I'M SORT OF -- I'M NOT THRILLED TO -- THIS IDEA, IT'S JUST ODD. IT'S OUT OF NOWHERE. UNTIL WE HAVE A PER CAPITA USAGE, WE REALLY DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH WATER PEOPLE USE WHERE. YOU MOO EIG MIGHT HAVE A HOUSE X PEOPLE IN IT, AND OF COURSE THEY USE MORE WATER THAN ONE PERSON IN IT. THE SECOND NOTION WHENEVER WE RAISE RATES FOR THE WATER, SOMEHOW IF PEOPLE DON'T SUPPORT RAISING THE RATES FOR THE WATER, IT'S AS IF THEY ARE ASKING OUR WALTER UTILITY COMPANY TO PUMP OUT FILTHY WATER, AND WE KNOW THAT THEY ARE NOT GOING TO DO THAT. WE KNOW THAT IF WE HAD ZERO MONEY IN THIS CITY, AND WE HAD TO PULL BACK EVERY BUILT OF INVESTMENT FROM EVERYTHING, WHAT WOULD BE THE LAST AND MOST IMPORTANT PRIMARY FUNCTION OF A CITY AND THAT WOULD BE PROVIDING CLEAN, SAFE, DRINKING WATER AND SANITARY SERVICES FOR THE RESIDENTS. IT'S OUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY AS A CITY COUNCIL IS TO PROVIDE SAFE DRINKING WATER AND SANITARY SERVICES AND SANITARY SEWER SERVICES. AND WE KNOW THAT. AND WE KNOW THAT STAFF IS GOING TO DO THAT. WITH OR WITHOUT US, JACKING THESE RATES UP ON HOMEOWNERS. THAT MONEY WILL COME FROM SOMEWHERE, TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THAT MOST IMPORTANT AND CRITICAL SERVICE OF THE CITY ADMINISTRATION. AND SO IT'S EASY FOR ME TO SAY NO RAISING THIS RATE. IT'S EASY! I CAN'T PUT IT ON PEOPLE ANYMORE. I'M NOT GOING TO DOUBLE PEOPLE'S WATER RATES. THERE'S OTHER PLACES WE CAN FIND THIS MONEY.
02:18:28.142: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
02:18:31.579: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER'S ASSERTION THAT IF WE JUST DON'T FUND THIS, THAT THE MONEY WILL COME FROM SOMEWHERE IS ABOUT THE MOST MAGICAL THINKING I HAVE HEARD IN A LONG TIME, LIKE, WE HAVE ENTERPRISE FUNDS FOR A REASON, SO THAT -- SO THAT WE HAVE A DEDICATED SOURCE OF FUNDING TO PAY FOR THESE ESSENTIAL SERVICES. THAT'S PRETTY BASIC GOVERNMENT FUNCTIONING AND IT'S -- I'M GLAD THAT WE HAVE THEM, SO THAT WE CAN PROTECT THOSE FUNDS BUT WE HAVE TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE THE MONEY TO PAY FOR THESE INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS BECAUSE THEY ARE INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE. NUMBER TWO, THIS IDEA THAT -- THAT PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN APARTMENTS USE LESS WATER THAN PEOPLE IN SINGLE FAMILY HOMES, THAT IT'S JUST BASED ON MAGICAL THINKING ISN'T TRUE. THITHERE'S ALOT OF GOOD DATA OU. IT'S NOT JUST ON THE AMOUNT OF WATER TO USE, WHEN THEY DON'T HAVE THINGS LIKE LAWNS BUT ALSO THE AMOUNT OF PIPE THAT IT TAKES TO DELIVER THE WATER. WE ARE NOT JUST PAYING FOR THE ACTUAL CONTAINER AND WE ARE PAYING FOR THE PIPES TO GET IT THERE. SO THERE IS MORE PIPE, THAT'S JUST FACT. GET WATER TO A SINGLE FAMILY HOME THAN THERE IS TO GET TO PEOPLE IN DENSELY POPULATED HOUSING. SO IF YOU WANT TO NOT PAY FOR THIS, THEN JUST SAY, YOU DON'T WANT TO PAY FOR IT. BUT TO ACCUSE STAFF OF MAGICAL THINKING, OF THINGS FULL OF FAULTY REASONING, THAT'S -- IT'S JUST SAD, FRANKLY.
02:20:07.942: >> Councilmember Hayner: MAYOR, MAY I -- MR. TAYLOR BEIN, POINT OF ORDER. I DIDN'T ACCUSE STAFF OF MAGICAL THINKING. I SAID THIS NOTION THAT SOMEHOW WE ARE GOING TO -- THE MAGICAL THINKING IS THAT WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION -- I MEAN, I DON'T EVEN WANT TO USE THAT TERM ANYMORE. I WILL WITHDRAW THE USE OF THAT TERM, BUT WE ARE NOT ASKING -- I'M NOT ACCUSING STAFF OF ANYTHING, AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT THEY WILL SERVE UP FILTHY WALTWATER THAT YOU SUGGESTED. AND I DON'T KNOW THE LAST TIME YOU HEARD A PLUMBING WRENCH, BUT I DON'T NEED A PLUMBING LESSON EITHER.
02:20:54.421: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? I WILL VOTE IN FAVOR OF THE RATES BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO PAY FOR THE WATER DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE AND TO PAY FOR THE WATER DISTRIBUTION AND TREATMENT SYSTEM THAT WE'RE GOING TO MAINTAIN OVER THE TIME AND THE WATER DISTRIBUTION AND TREATMENT SYSTEM THAT WE WILL BUILD FOR FUTURE RESIDENTS. THE ONLY WAY THAT WE CAN DO THAT IS IF WE RAISE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES WITHIN THE WATER FUND. AND THE SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE IS, IN MY VIEW, AN EQUITABLE ONE. IT RELATES THE COST OF WATER TO THE COST OF DELIVERING THE WATER. AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE ALL RECOGNIZE -- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE PUBLIC RECOGNIZE WE ARE NOT ACTUALLY CHARGING FOR THE WATER. WITH ERRWE ARE CHARGING FOR THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM ASSOCIATED WITH THE WATER. WATER IS INCONSEQUENTIAL. WE ARE GETTING IT FROM THE RIVER. WE HAVE TO CLEAN IT AND DISTRIBUTE IT AND THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM AND THE TREATMENT SYSTEM, THAT 'S WHERE THE MAIN COSTS ARE. I BELIEVE THAT WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS A PUNT INCREASE IN ORDER TO RAISE CAPITAL SUFFICIENT TO MAKE OUR WATER TREATMENT PLANT READY FOR FUTURE CONTAMINANTS TO MAKE OUR WATER TREATMENT PLANT READY FOR FUTURE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND TO REQUIRE PORTIONS OF OUR WATER TREATMENT PLANT FUNCTIONAL PORTIONS OF OUR WATER TREATMENT PLANT THAT DATES BACK TO THE 1930s. THE ONLY WAY TO DO THOSE THINGS, THE CRITICAL TH THINGS IS TO RAE MONEY AND THAT'S WHAT WE ARE DOING HERE. I WILL SAY IN CLOSING ON THIS POINT, THAT OUR WATER RATES CONTINUE TO BE WITHIN THE HEART LAND. WE ARE NOT AN OUTLIER IN MICHIGAN. WE WILL NOT BE AN OUTLIER IN MICHIGAN. THESE RATES ARE REASONABLE FOR THE SERVICE PROVIDED. THEY ARE REASONABLE FOR THE SERVICE THAT WE ARE PLANNING FOR FUTURE RESIDENTS. FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.

02:24:45.919: >> Councilmember Nelson: THANK YOU, MAYOR TAYLOR THIS IS IN RESPONSE TO A LOT OF CONVERSATION I H HEARD IN THE COMMUNITY. CONVERSATIONS THAT WE HEARD ABOUT ACCESS TO FOOD. I HAVE TALKED A LOT ABOUT HAVING -- STARTING GARDENS AND CHICKENS ARE SORT OF A CLOSE COUSIN TO THAT. THIS AMENDMENT IS JUST A SIMPLIFICATION OF OUR CHICKEN ORDINANCE AND UNDER OUR CURRENT ORDINANCE, CONTINUE CAN KEEP TWO CHICKENS BUT WE HAVE GOT EXTRA OBSTACLES TO KEEPING SIX CHICKENS AND I -- I SENT EXTENSIVE EMAILS TO COUNCIL SORT OF EXPLAINING HOW THIS TWO BIRD PERMIT AND SIX-BIRD PERMIT ARE NOT A REALLY GOOD IDEA GENERALLY, BUT THIS IS JUST AN EFFORT TO -- TO TREAT CHICKENS MORE SIMILARLY TO OTHER PETS THAT WE REGULARLY ACCEPT INTO OUR NEIGHBORHOODS. AND I HOPE THAT IT'S NOT TERRIBLY CONTROVERSIAL. MY OWN SENSE OF THIS HAVING KEPT CHICKENS NOW FOR FIVE YEARS IS CHICKENS ARE A WHOLE LOT LESS DISRUPTIVE THAN THINGS LIKE DOGS AND CATS THAT WE NEVER EVEN THINK ABOUT HAVING NEIGHBOR NOTIFICATION AROUND. SO I -- I THINK THAT DEREK DELACOURT IS AVAILABLE TO SPEAK ON THIS. HE AND I SPOKE AT LENGTH ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR AMENDMENT BECAUSE HE HAS SOME EXPERIENCE WITH A SIMILAR ORDINANCE IN FERNDALE. I HOPE THAT THIS PASSES FIRST READING AND I APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S SUPPORT OF IT. I FEEL LIKE CHICKENS ARE A GOOD NG THIS. I KNOW THAT -- A GOOD THING. I KNOW THAT DURING THIS PAN PANDEMIC, MY FAMILY APPRECIATE YATEED THAT WE NEVER HAD TO BUY EGGS. I READ THAT THE PRICE OF EGGS HAS TRIPLED DURING THIS PANDEMIC. AND SO IT'S A REALLY GOOD THING, BUT WE NEVER HAD TO GO TO THE GROCERY STORE AND SHOP FOR THEM. SO I HOPE THAT WE CAN ALL SUPPORT THIS. THANK YOU.
02:26:50.611: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
02:26:51.778: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES, THANK YOU. I ASKED MS. BEAUDRY TO ADD ME AS A COSPONSOR FOR THIS. I AGREE WITH COUNCILWOMAN NELSON THAT THIS GETS TO THE HEART OF KINDS OF THINGS WE SHOULD BE DOING AS A CITY. IT'S -- I WOULD PREFER NO REGULATION OF THIS, BUT BECAUSE IT IS AGRICULTURE COMMODITY IN THE STATE, THE STATE ALLOWS US TO REGULATE IT. THE SIMPLER THE REGULATION, THE BETTER FOR ME. THAT'S WHAT THIS REVISION DOES. IT SIMPLIFIES THE REGULATION. I THINK EVERYBODY WHO KNOWS PEOPLE WHO KEEPS CHICKEN KNOWS THAT WHEN THEY HAD TWO CHICKENS, THEY HAD FOUR, AND WHEN THEY HAD FOUR, THEY HAD SIX. AND SO I THINK IT'S PERFECTLY FINE TO ALLOW SIX BIRDS. I THINK IT'S THE RIGHT MOVE, AND IT'S -- IT'S EMPOWERING PEOPLE TO LOOK AFTER THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES AND I WOULD MUCH RATHER EMPOWER PEOPLE THAN, YOU KNOW, GIVE HANDOUTS. AND SO I THINK IT'S GREAT THAT PEOPLE ARE TAKING THIS UP AS A HOBBY AND AS A NECESSITY IN SOME CASES AND SO I -- I AM ASKING FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR COUNCILWOMAN NELSON'S RESOLUTION.
02:28:00.447: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
02:28:01.982: >> Councilmember Eaton: I WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A COSPONSOR AAND I SUPPORT THIS. I BELIEVE WE ALLOW OTHER THINGS MUCH MORE DISRUPTIVE THAN SIX CHICKENS WITHOUT A PERMIT, SUCH AS DOGS. YOU CAN BUILD AN ADU AND MOVE ENTIRE FAMILY ON TO YOUR PROPERTY WITHOUT THE PERMISSION OF YOUR NEIGHBORS BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE THAT YOU NEED THE PERMISSION OF YOUR NEIGHBORS SIMPLY TO HAVE SOME CHICKENS. SO I WHOLEHEARTEDLY SUPPORT THIS.
02:28:34.081: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
02:28:35.015: >> Councilmember Bannister:  I SUPPORT THIS TOO, FOR ALL THE COMMENTS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED, AND I WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A COSPONSOR ALSO. AND AS I WALK AROUND WARD 1, I THINK THIS IS IN KEEPING WITH WHAT RESIDENTS ARE LOOKING TO DO. THEY ARE PLANTING GARDENS. THEY ARE ASKING ABOUT PUTTING COMMUNITY GARDENS INTO SOME OF THE VACANT PARK AREAS. AND I THINK THE IDEA OF OUR CHICKENS IS GREAT. AND I'M ALSO CURIOUS TO WHAT MR. DELACOURT RECALLS FROM THE FERNDALE EXPERIENCE.
02:29:13.286: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. DELACOURT, THE FLOOR IS YOURS.
02:29:16.323: >> WOW! I FEEL LUCKY. THANK YOU FOR ASKING MS. BANNISTER. I DON'T HAVE TOO MUCH TO ADD, OTHER THAN I DEALT WITH THIS IN TWO PREVIOUS CITIES AND WHEN COUNCILMEMBER NELSON BROUGHT IT UP, I WHOLEHEARTEDLY OFFERED TO JUMP IN AND SUPPORT IN ANY WAY THAT I COULD, JUST THAT IT WAS YEARS AGO AND THIS WAS A LOT OF MISCONCEPTION AND WHAT ALLOWING CHICKENS TWO, FOUR, SIX IN A MORE SUBURBAN ENVIRONMENT AND FERNDALE MORE URBAN. IN BOTH OF THOSE INCIDENTS IN NEITHER ONE OF THEM DID THE FEARS OR THE CONCERNS COME TO FRUITION. RAISING AND KEEPING CHICKENS IN AN URBAN ENVIRONMENT IS DIFFICULT. IF YOU DON'T PAY ATTENTION TO IT, IF YOU DON'T DO IT IN AN APPROPRIATE MANNER AND IN A MANNER THAT IS RESPECTFUL OF BOTH OF YOUR NEIGHBORS AND THE ANIMALS, THEY TEND NOT TO SURVIVE AND IT'S AN EXPENSIVE HOBBY TO GET INTO AS WELL. SO IN MY TWO PREVIOUS INSTANCES, INSTANCES,WHETHER IT WAS TWO OR, WHETHER THE PERMITS WERE ISSUED, THERE HAS NEVER BEEN THE CONCERN OR THE COMPLAINTS OR THE ISSUES RAISED WITH NEIGHBORS. SO I OFFERED AND I HAVE A SOFT SPOT FOR URBAN CHICKENS. SO I PREFER THE RESTRICTIONS BEING REDUCED. THANK THANK YOU TO COUNCILWOMAN NELSON FOR DOING THIS. IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS, I WOULD BE BLAH GLAD TO ANSWER TH.
02:30:50.917: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBERCR NELSON.
02:30:53.487: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU FOR DOING THIS. I GOT INVOLVED WITH ALLOWING CHICKENS AT SCHOOL. IT'S A LOT OF FUN TO WORK ON. I'M GLAD THIS IS MOVING FORWARD.
02:31:07.167: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
02:31:08.034: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I GUESS THIS IS A QUESTION FOR COUNCILMAN DELACOURT. IN THE CURRENT LEGISLATION AND THE SUGGESTED LEGISLATION, ONLY USING IT MEANS CHICKENS AND DUCKS OR A COMBINATION OF BOTH? IS THERE REASON FROM THE STATE THAT SOMEBODY COULDN'T KEEP, SAY, QUAIL OR P FOWL OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT? IS THERE ANY REASON THAT WE DEFINE CHICKENS AND DUCKS SOLELY.
02:31:41.001: >> I THINK MS. LARCOM'S DESK.
02:31:51.011: >> IF ANYONE FROM THE CITY STAFF COULD TELL.
02:31:54.514: >> Councilmember Hayner:  OH, YOU CAN TELL.
02:31:55.615: >> I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE SMARTER THAN I COULD TELL. IF SHE'S AVAILABLE.
02:32:03.823: >> City Atty. Postema: SHE'S NOT AVAILABLE. WE WILL SEND SOME ADDITIONAL THINGS FROM THE PRIOR ITERATION OF THIS. THERE WERE CONCERNS RAISED THERE. THAT'S WHY THE -- THE LIMITATION. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT A LOT OF -- OF PEOPLE MISUNDERSTOOD THERE'S A LOT OF NEIGHBORHOODS THAT THEY ARE ACTUALLY NOT ALLOWED TO BE BECAUSE OF THE DEED RESTRICTIONS. AND THIS -- THIS DOESN'T -- THIS DOESN'T ELIMINATE THAT. THOSE DEED RESTRICTIONS ARE THERE FOR A REASON, AND SO THERE'S A LOT OF PLATTED NEIGHBORHOODS AND OTHER THINGS WHERE -- WHERE THIS WOULD NOT TAKE EFFECT. AND SO IT'S IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO KNOW THAT.
02:32:44.364: >> Councilmember Hayner:  IS THAT -- MR. POSTEMA, YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT DEED RESTRICTIONS AND HOMEOWNERS AGREEMENTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT?
02:32:54.674: >> City Atty. Postema: IT COULD BE HOMEOWNERS AND IT COULD BE PLATTED AREAS AND WHOLE SUBDIVISIONS WHERE THEY ARE RESTRICTED. PEOPLE NEED TO LOOK AT THEIR DEED.
02:33:02.949: >> Councilmember Hayner:  IS THAT AVAILABLE ON A MAP? IS THAT A GIS LAYER WE CAN FIND?
02:33:09.856: >> City Atty. Postema: NOT NECESSARILY. IT'S JUST THERE. AND SO WE WANTED TO JUST MAKE THAT CLEAR IN THE PRIOR ITERATION BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES NEIGHBORS GET INTO THE DISPUTE AND IT'S ACTUALLY A PROBLEM WITH THEIR DEEDS AND SO PEOPLE JUST NEED TO KNOW THAT.
02:33:28.708: >> Councilmember Hayner: OKAY. THANK YOU.
02:33:32.045: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN? ZACK JUST A QUICK ONE. JUST BY WAY OF CONTEXT, IT WAS ORIGINALLY CH CHICKENS GOING BAK TO AROUND 2013ISH TIME FRAME AND THEN COUNCIL WARPEHOSKI, CHICKENS AND DUCKS WERE A BIG PET PASSION OF HIS.
02:33:54.734: >> City Atty. Postema: THAT'S RIGHT.
02:33:55.669: >> Councilmember Ackerman: AND HE WAS ABLE TO PROPOSE THE EXPANSION TO DUCKS IN 2018, WHICH WAS APPROVED BY COUNCIL.
02:34:01.341: >> City Atty. Postema: AND THERE MAY BE NO REASON. I WILL JUST DIG UP THE OLD MEMOS AND I WILL TALK WITH CAN KRISTEN LARCOM AND FIND OUT IF THERE IS ANYTHING.
02:34:14.120: >> MAYOR?
02:34:14.421: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
02:34:14.921: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I WAS GOING TO CONCUR WITH COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN. IT WAS NOT EXCLUSIVE TO DUCKS -- IT WAS EXCLUSIVE TO CHICKENS, AND THEN DUCKS WERE ADDED. ZACK THE FAMOUS WARPEHOSKI.
02:34:41.348: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] ALL OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. DC-1, RESOLUTION TO APPROVE A WAIVER OF LATE PENALTY CHARGE FOR LATE TAX PAYMENTS IN RESPONSE TO THE COVID-19 NOVEL CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, AND SECONDED BY RAMLAWI. DISCUSSION OF DC-1. I GUESS I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A START ON THIS. I'M DELIGHTED -- I HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS WITH COUNCILMEMBERS LUMM AND RAMLAWI. WE HAVE VERY FEW POINTS OF ENTERY ARE, WHEN IT COMES TO SUPPORTING RESIDENTS AND BUSINESSES AS THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. WE DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, OBVIOUSLY, OR THE STATE GOVERNMENT OR FRANKLY EVEN THE COUNTY. ONE THING WE CAN DO, HOWEVER, IS ADJUST THE PENALTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE PAYMENTS OF PROPERTY TAXES. WE NATURALLY CANNOT AVOID PROPERTY TAXES. WE NEED PROPERTY TAXES IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THE CITY SERVICES UPON WHICH CIVIL SOCIETY RESTS. BUT NEVERTHELESS, WE DO HAVE AN ABILITY TO ASSIST PROPERTY OWNERS -- BY ADJUSTING THE PENALTIES ASSOCIATED WITH LATE PAYMENT. OUR ABILITY TO ADJUST THAT, MAKE THOSE ADJUSTMENTS IS CONSTRAINED. IT'S CONSTRAINED BY STATE LAW AND BY CITY CHARTER. IT'S CONSTRASTRAINED TEMPORALLY. WE HAVE THE AUGUST PAYMENT AND THE AUGUST PENALTY AND THE -- THE SEPTEMBER THROUGH DECEMBER PENALTY ARE THE TWO POINTS OF ENTRY. AND, YOU KNOW, IN CONSULTATION WITH MY COLLEAGUES AND WITH STAFF, WE SETTLED UPON THE ELIMINATION OF THE AUGUST PENALTY. AND THE REDUCTION OF THE -- OF THE FALL PENALTY FROM 5% TO 2.5%. WE HAVE CONSULTED WITH OTHER TAXING JURISDICTIONS TO ENSURE THAT IT WOULD NOT CAUSE UPON THEM A HARDSHIP. AND, YOU KNOW, WE ARE SATISFIED THAT THAT'S THE KA NOT THE CASE. WE KNOW THAT THEY HAVE A TAX PAYMENT LOOMING. FOR SOME THAT HAD BEEN READILY PAYABLE AND FOR TAXPAYERS THAT CAN PAY THE FEE -- PARDON ME, THAT CAN PAY THE TAX, I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO SO. THE CITY COULD USE THE FUNDS. FOR THOSE WHO NEED TO AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THE -- OF THE DELAY, FOR MY PART YOU ARE WELCOME TO. YOU KNOW, WE DO WHAT WE CAN AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DO BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THIS IS A VERY SUBSTANTIAL -- A VERY SUBSTANTIAL CRISIS IN OUR COMMUNITY. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
02:37:31.951: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANKS, MR. MAYOR.
02:37:33.620: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU FOR WALKING US THROUGH, I'M HAPPY TO COSPONSOR THIS WITH COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, AND -- [ GARBLED AUDIO ] SO THEY COULD WORK --
02:37:53.206: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER, LUMM? I'M HAVING A HARD TIME UNDERSTANDING YOU. AM I THE ONLY PERSON?
02:37:58.578: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I'M HAVING TROUBLE TOO.
02:38:01.381: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. ARE YOU ABLE TO --
02:38:03.716: >> Councilmember Lumm: CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW?
02:38:06.352: >> Mayor Taylor: THAT'S OKAY. TRY TALKING.
02:38:11.424: >> TRY SPEAKING CLOSER TO YOUR COMPUTER, IF YOU MIGHT.
02:38:15.395: >> Councilmember Lumm: CAN YOU HEAR ME? OKAY. THANKS. SORRY ABOUT THAT. SO I WILL REPEAT A COUPLE OF THINGS. FIRST, THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. AGAIN, I'M HAPPY TO COSPONSOR THIS WITH YOU AND COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI AND I WOULD LIKE TO THANK STAFF, MR. HORNING, AND MS. LAKE, AND MR. CRAWFORD FOR THE GOOD WORK AND ASSISTANCE TO PROVIDING -- IN PULLING THIS TOGETHER. THE -- AS WE ALL KNOW THE SUMMER PROPERTY TAX PAYMENTS ARE DUE JULY 31st, AND SEVERAL COUNCILMEMBERS ASKED STAFF WHAT WE COULD DO TO REASONABLY PROVIDE FOLKS SOME TEMPORARY RELIEF IN THESE CHALLENGING TIMES. AND I DO THINK THAT THE RECOMMENDATION FROM STAFF THAT'S BEFORE US TONIGHT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE AND I HOPE WE WILL ALSO SUPPORT IT. THE RESOLUTION ASKS ASKS AS THER CLAIMED IS -- 1% ON -- AND 2.5% OF THE 5% -- [ GARBLED AUDIO ] SEPTEMBER 1. I WILL NOTE THAT THE WAIVER DOES NOT APPLY TO TAX PAYMENTS ESCROWED BY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THE WAIVERS DO HAVE A COST TO THE CITY, IN TERMS OF THE LOST LATE FEES AND THE INVESTMENT WELCOME, AND IT'S ESTIMATED THE COST WILL BE ABOUT $350,000 TO -- $140,000 FOR THE AUGUST WAIVER AND 210,000 FOR THE PARTIAL SEPTEMBER WAIVER. AND BECAUSE OF THAT, THE RESOLUTION ALSO ENCOURAGES ALL TO PAY TAXES AND PLEASE DO SO BY JULY 31st. THE PARTIAL SEPTEMBER DEADLINE, IF INCENTIVE TO PAY BY AUGUST 31st. FOR THOSE WHO SIMPLY CANNOT PAY AT THAT TIME. AND AS THE MAYOR NOTED, THE CITY STAFF REACHED OUT TO THE OTHER ORGANIZATIONS THAT THE CITY COLLECTS TAXES ON BEHALF OF, AND THAT INCLUDES THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS, THE DISTRICT LIBRARY, AATA, THE COUNTY WASHTENAW COMMUNITY COLLEGE, AND I BELIEVE ISD, AND I APPRECIATE THAT CITY STAFF REACHED OUT TO THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PAYMENT DELAYS WOULD NOT CAUSE THEM SIGNIFICANT CASH FLOW ISSUES. THANK YOU, STAFF, FOR DOING THAT AS WELL. SO BOTTOM LINE, I -- I THINK THIS RESOLUTION BREAKS THE APPROPRIATE BALANCE OF PROVIDING SOME TEMPORARY RELIEF, BUT AS A REASONABLE COST TO THE CITY, AND I HOPE EVERYONE AGREES AND WE'LL JOIN IN IN SUPPORTING THIS TONIGHT. THANK YOU.
02:41:22.448: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
02:41:24.350: >> Councilmember Ackerman: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, YOU WANT TO SPEAK FIRST?
02:41:28.321: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  GO AHEAD.
02:41:29.255: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  I WAS GOING TO SAY THANK YOU FOR LEADERSHIP, MAYOR TAYLOR AND TO YOU RAMLAWI AND LUMM. I THINK IT'S FANTASTIC THAT WE CAN PREDICT A PROBLEM FOR HOUSEHOLDS AND WORK DILIGENTLY AND QUICKLY TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO HELP. SO VERY GRATEFUL. AND THANKS TO THE TEAMS THAT THE CITY'S FINANCE OFFICE AND LEGAL OFFICE FOR THEIR HELP AND NOT JUST DEALING WITH IT BUT TO EXPRESS MY APPLAUD I WOULD LOVE TO BE ADDED AS A COSPONSOR AS WELL.
02:42:00.186: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
02:42:01.187: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, AND THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH MYSELF AND COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, WITH STAFF, IN GETTING THIS OUT INTO TIME FOR FOLKS TO START PLANNING ON WHO TO DO NEXT. IT'S APPRECIATED NOT JUST THE RESIDENTS BUT THE BUSINESSES OF ANN ARBOR AS WELL. I KNOW MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES IN THE SMALL BUSINESS WORLD ARE IN SHELL SHOCK RIGHT NOW. PROBABLY MORE THAN RESIDENTS ARE. AND THIS WILL HELP THEM AS WELL. MOST TENANTS HAVE TO PAY THEIR PROPERTY TAXES. MOST OF THESE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE PROPERTY TAXES TO ARE BUILDINGS THEY DO NOT OWN, LIKE MYSELF. SO IT'S -- IT'S VERY WELCOMED AND DEEPLY APPRECIATED AND THE FLURRY OF INFORMATION GOING BACK AND FORTH IS WE LEARNED WHAT IS POSSIBLE AND WHAT IS NOT POSSIBLE AND GETTING IT DONE IN TIME, AND IT'S JUST GREATLY APPRECIATED. AND I JUST WANTED TO SAY THANK YOU.
02:43:22.501: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
02:43:23.970: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I WOULD JUST LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A COSPONSOR. I'M GRATEFUL FOR ANY OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO RELIEVE THE BURDEN ON RESIDENTS. THERE'S A LOT OF SITUATIONS THAT WE DON'T HAVE POWER OVER. SO AIM GLAD FOR US TO -- TO MAKE SOME EFFORT IN WHAT WE CAN DO. THANKS.
02:43:44.190: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
02:43:45.491: >> Councilmember Bannister: THANK YOU. I WOULD LIKE TO REQUEST TO BE ADDED AS A COSPONSOR ALSO. AND I WAS WONDERING HOW THIS WILL BE COMMUNICATED TO RESIDENTS. BECAUSE YOU THINK THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF KNOWLEDGE JUST IN THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT WE CAN AND CAN'T DO AND HOW IT WORKS AND I KNOW THAT THE WARD ONE RESIDENTS WERE ASKING FOR A LOT OF RELIEF WITH THE PROPERTY TAX AND I'M GRATEFUL THAT WE HAVE THIS SOLUTION BUT I WAS WONDERING HOW WE WERE GOING TO COMMUNICATE THE THINGS WE COULDN'T DO AND WHY THIS IS OUR BEST SOLUTION AND SO FORTH.
02:44:32.571: >> TO BE HONEST, WE HAVEN'T COME UP WITH A COMMUNICATION PLAN BECAUSE WE DIDN'T KNOW IF IT WOULD PASS. OUR TIME FRAME, IT WILL BE ON THE BILL THAT THEY RECEIVE AND SO IT WILL BE VERY CLEAR ON -- ON THERE -- ON WHAT THE EXPECTATION IS.
02:44:50.423: >> Councilmember Bannister: THANK YOU.
02:44:54.060: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
02:44:55.161: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU. I THINK THIS MIGHT BE A QUESTION FOR MR. CRAWFORD OR THE SPONSORS. I GUESS I WOULD SAY THE ORIGINAL SPONSORS. SO I'M READING THIS DIRECTLY THAT THERE'S NO OPPORTUNITY -- IF SOMEONE ESCROWS THEIR TAXES THROUGH THEIR MORTGAGE LENDER LIKE MANY, THERE'S NO OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE IN THIS PROGRAM, THAT'S CORRECT?
02:45:18.117: >> Mayor Taylor: CORRECT.
02:45:20.319: >> Councilmember Hayner:  AND DO WE HAVE ANY SENSE OF WHAT PERCENTAGE OF TAXES ARE MADE BY ESCROW, VERSUS WHAT ARE PAID BY, YOU KNOW, DIRECT PAY?
02:45:30.830: >> City Admin. Crawford: WE HAVE MR. HORNING ON. I WOULD LIKE HIM TO COMMENT, IF HE COULD. MATT, YOU ARE MUTED.
02:45:53.919: >> AND NOW I'M FROZEN. CAN YOU HEAR ME?
02:45:59.925: >> Mayor Taylor: WE ARE HEAR YOU, YES.
02:46:01.394: >> MY UNMUTE WAS NOT ON THE SCREEN. WE HAVE ABOUT 30% OF OUR TAXPAYERS THAT PAY THROUGH HE IS ESCROW. THEY PAID THEIR MONEY TO THE IF MANY INSTITUTIONS AND THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION IS HOLDING THOSE FUNDS WITH THE EXPECTATION OF PAYING THE TAX. SO THERE'S NO BENEFIT THAT IS BEING DENIED.
02:46:29.789: >> Councilmember Hayner:  WHEN WE COLLECT THE 110 MILLION IN PROPERTY TAXES; IS THAT RIGHT? I JUST WONDERED, IS IT TYPICAL THAT WE HAVE -- I'M TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF HOW MANY FOLKS -- I THINK IT'S GREAT OF DOING SOMETHING. I WONDER HOW MANY FOLKS ARE REALLY LATE ON THESE DIRECT PAYMENTS, 66% OF PEOPLE WHO PAY THE PROPERTY TAXES. IS IT TYPICAL THAT WE WOULD ASSESS AND COLLECT LATE FEES OR IS IT MOSTLY PAID ON TIME? LIKE IN THE PAST.
02:47:06.992: >> WE ARE IN NEW TERRITORY. WE HAVE NEVER WAIVED THE PENALTIES FOR PROPERTY TAXES.
02:47:12.765: >> Councilmember Hayner:  LIKE LAST YEAR, YOU WOULD HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT WE COLLECTED IN PROPERTY TAX PENALTIES.
02:47:17.336: >> OF COURSE. OF COURSE. WE DO. WE DON'T HAVE ANY EMPIRICAL DATA WITH WHICH WE CAN MODEL THIS. SO WHAT WE DID IS WE LOOKED AT PAST PAYMENT DATA OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, AND HOW MANY PEOPLE PAID ON TIME, AND HOW MANY PEOPLE DID NOT. AND THEN MADE ASSUMPTIONS IF WE OMITTED THE 1% AUGUST 1 PENALTY, WHAT WOULD HAPPEN. AND WE ASSUMED THE WORST CASE SCENARIO THAT EVERYONE THAT'S ELIGIBLE TO NOT PAY FOR THEIR TAXES WOULD DELAY THEIR -- PAYING THEIR TAXES A MONTH. THAT WAS 66%. SO THE COST FIGURES THAT WE HAVE PRESENTED TO YOU, ARE THE WORST CASE SCENARIO FOR AUGUST 1 PENALTY. AND THEN --
02:48:04.650: >> Councilmember Hayner:  SO THAT'S SORT OF -- [ NO AUDIO ]
02:48:14.727: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
02:48:15.828: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I HAD A WEIRD DELAY THERE. SO THAT -- THAT IT'S SORT OF -- IT'S NOT MONEY WE HAVE COLLECTED LAST YEAR IN PAYMENTS. WE HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT THAT WAS. THAT'S PROJECTED WORST CASE SCENARIO AND IT'S DEFERRED LATE PAYMENT OR LOSS OF REVENUE FOR THE PAYMENTS? SO IT'S NOT -- WE'RE GIVING AWAY SOMETHING THAT WE MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE HAD?
02:48:45.991: >> WELL, BASED ON LAST YEAR'S PAYMENT DATA, THE 50,000 PENALTY THAT WE CITED IN THE RESOLUTION IS WHAT WE WOULD HAVE -- WHAT WE DID COLLECT LAST YEAR, THAT WE CAN NOT COLLECT THIS YEAR IF WE WAIT.
02:49:01.106: >> Councilmember Hayner:  SO WE HAD ABOUT 50K IN LATE FEES LAST YEAR? YOU ARE CUTTING OUT REALLY BADLY.
02:49:12.384: >> City Admin. Crawford: YES, THERE IS $50,000 THAT WE WOULD NO THE BE RECEIVING AND THEN THERE'S LOST INTEREST THAT WE TYPICALLY EARN THAT WE WOULD NOT EARN BECAUSE OF THE RECEIPT OF THE PAYMENTS LATER.
02:49:23.729: >> Councilmember Hayner:  ALL RIGHT. OKAY. I'M LOOKING FOR WAYS TO HELP RELIEVE. WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT OF WORK. A LOT OF PEOPLE ASKING ME WHAT CAN WE DO TO HELP OUT? YOU KNOW, OF THE DOLLAR'S WORTH OF -- IF WE ARE ONE TAX DOLLAR SPLIT BETWEEN ALL THE PEOPLE WHO GET IT, YOU KNOW, WE ARE LIKE A QUARTER OF THAT, IF YOU INCLUDE THE DD A AND STUFF. AND THE SCHOOLS ARE HIGHER EDUCATION ARE ABOUT HALF OF THAT AND SO I'M GLAD THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY TROUBLE WITH THE SCHOOLS SAYING WE NEED OUR MONEY UP FRONT BECAUSE THEY EASILY COLLECT MORE OF THAT DOLLAR THAN THE CITY DOES. SO --
02:50:05.004: >> City Admin. Crawford: BUT THIS WAS A CHALLENGING ONE BECAUSE AS YOU MAY RECALL, MR. HAJRA HAD MENTIONED WHEN HE PRESENTED TO YOU EARLIER. IDEALLY A TOOL THAT YOU USE TO HELP CAN BE DIRECTED TO THOSE MOST IN NEED IN BARRIER BUSTERS IN. THIS CASE, THERE'S NOT A TOOL TO GET TO THE TAXPAYERS IN NEED. YOU DON'T HAVE THAT UNDER STATE LAW AND THIS BY NECESSITY IS A BROADER BRUSH AND THAT'S WHY WE HAD TO MAKE THE MONTH ARE SWEEPING ASSUMPTIONS.
02:50:36.969: >> Councilmember Hayner:  ALL RIGHT. OKAY. THANKS. I MEAN, I -- IT'S NICE THAT WE ARE DOING SOMETHING, BUT IT -- YOU SNOW, 50,000 OUT OF 100 MILLION JUST DOESN'T -- YOU KNOW, IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO NEED IT. SO I GUESS THAT'S WHAT MATTERS. IT SEEMS LIKE WE COULD DO BETTER SOMEHOW.
02:50:57.923: >> City Admin. Crawford: THE BENEFIT IS NOT JUST THE $50,000. IT GIVES THEM MORE TIME TO ACTUALLY GET THE PAYMENT, SAVE FOR THE PAYMENT. THAT TIMING IS REALLY SIGNIFICANT.
02:51:10.202: >> Councilmember Hayner: YEAH, SURE. I KNOW IT'S IMPORTANT TO THE INDIVIDUAL USER, JUST IN THE GRAND SCHEME OF THE THINGS, IT JUST SEEMS LIKE, YOU KNOW -- I MEAN -- I DON'T KNOW. I WISH I COULD SOMETHING BETTER TO DO FOR OUR RESIDENTS. I WILL THINK ABOUT THAT.
02:51:31.390: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
02:51:32.224: >> Councilmember Eaton: I WANT TO THANK THE COUNCILMEMBERS FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND THE STAFF FOR GIVING THIS FULL ANALYSIS OF THE COST AND THE BENEFIT. AND SEEKING TO STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN EXCUSING ALL THE PENALTIES OR JUST APPROACHING THIS INCREMENTALLY. AND IT ALSO HAS TO BE ADDED AS A COSPONSOR TOO.
02:51:55.647: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
02:51:56.582: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES, THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK TWICE ON THIS. I JUST WANTED TO PUSH BACK A LITTLE BIT TO MY COLLEAGUE, WHO SAYS WE SHOULD BE DOING MORE, PERHAPS AND I APOLOGIZE IF I MISUNDERSTOOD THAT. THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT GIVE AND IT'S ONLY ONE OF MANY THINGS THAT WE WILL HAVE TO DO. THIS IS NOT THE SILVER BULLET. THIS IS NOT GOING TO SAVE YOU IF YOU ARE -- YOU KNOW, THIS IS JUST HOW IT ALLEVIATES. I KNOW MY SUMMER TAX BILL HERE IS OVER $20,000. I'M A SMALL BUSINESS. BEING ABLE TO FLOAT SOME MONEY HERE AND THERE AND PAYING -- YOU KNOW, ROBBING PETER TO PAY PAUL, IF I GET THAT RIGHT, YOU KNOW, THAT'S HOW WE GOT TO WORK THINGS HERE AS SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO GET VERY RESOURCEFUL FOR HOW WE JUGGLE THINGS GOING FORWARD. AND SO HAVING 30 DAYS, 60 DAYS, WITHOUT BEING PENALTYIZED, I THINK IS SIGNIFICANT, IT'S HUGE. YOU KNOW, I KNOW THAT PEOPLE WANT MORE. IT'S NEVER GOING TO BE ENOUGH, BUT I THINK THIS IS VERY SIGNIFICANT. THANK YOU.
02:53:17.596: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES]
02:53:26.438: >> Mayor Taylor: ALL OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. LET'S TAKE A BREAK. WE WILL RECONVENE AT 10:03. [ BREAK ]
03:06:26.049: >> Mayor Taylor: WE ARE BACK IN OPEN SESSION. MY APOLOGIES FOR THE LATE RESTART. DC-2, RESOLUTION TO ENDORSE THE FAIR AND EQUAL MICHIGAN CAMPAIGN. MOVED BY GRISWOLD, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER SMITH. DISCUSSION PLEASE, COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
03:06:44.969: >> Councilmember Griswold:  WE HEARD ABOUT THIS ALREADY FROM MICHELLE HUGHES. SO GIVEN THE TIME, I DON'T HAVE ANY FURTHER -- ANYTHING FURTHER TO SAY.
03:07:04.255: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
03:07:09.827: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I APPRECIATE EVERYONE DOING THEIR JOBS AND MAKE IT TO BE EASY ON MY PART. THANK YOU TO EVERYBODY AND HOPEFULLY THIS BEC BECOMES A LAW SOON. IT'S WAY OVERDUE.
03:07:29.380: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
03:07:31.349: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I SIGNED THIS. MY WIFE DID. MY T SON DID. WE SIGNED A PAPER VERSION OF IT. AS WE SEE, SOMETIMES THE ONLY WAY TO GET SOMETHING PUT OVER INTO LAW IS THROUGH THE PETITION DRIVE AND I THINK IT'S A GOOD THING THAT THAT EXISTS IN OUR RIGHTS. IF I'M NOT MISTAPE, COUNCILMEMBER EATON, WE SPOKE ABOUT AT THIS AT ONE OF OUR POLICY AGENDA. I WISH ELLIOTT LARSON, WAS SIMPLIFIED AND YOU WERE TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO ME WHY IT IS WE ENUMERATE LISTS OF IDENTITIES LIKE THIS IN LAW. AND THERE'S SOME L LEGAL STANDARDS. YOU CAN'T HAVE AIL BLANKET STATEMENT LIKE I SUGGESTED IT SHOULD BE. I WAS CONFUSED ABOUT THAT. AND I ALSO -- LIKE, IS THIS TYPICAL FOR THIS BODY TO ASK PEOPLE TO SIGN A PETITION? I KNOW I HAD A CONSTITUENT SAY THAT THEY WENT TO SIGN ONLINE AND THEY ASKED FOR HER MICHIGAN DRIVER'S LICENSE NUMBER. I ASSUME IT'S SOME WAY THAT THEY ARE USING TO VERIFY THAT YOU ARE A RESIDENT OF THE STATE OF MICHIGAN OR SOMETHING AND THEY WERE CONCERNED ABOUT PUTTING THAT IN. AND SO HE THIS DEPOSIT WANT TO SIGN ONLINE. -- THEY DIDN'T WANT TO SIGN ONLINE. I DON'T KNOW IF ANYBODY KNEW ABOUT THAT, IF ANY OF THE SPONSORS WANTED TO SPEAK TO THAT OR THE REASON WE HAVE TO ENUMERATE LIKE THIS. I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN HEARING ABOUT THAT. I DON'T RECALL US URGING PEOPLE TO SIGN A PETITION. IT'S NOT THAT THE GOAL ISN'T RIGHT AND IT'S NOT THE RIGHT THING TO DO IN MY OPINION, BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY, I SIGNED IT, BUT IT'S ODD. IT'S PATERNALISTIC TO ASK SOMEBODY TO GO DO SOMETHING. THAT'S ALL. JUST SOME COMMENTS.
03:09:25.997: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER EATON?
03:09:28.666: >> Councilmember Eaton: SO FIRST, I WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A COSPONSOR AND APPRECIATE THE SPONSORS BRINGING THIS RECORD. LAST YEAR, THE -- AT MY URGING, THE POLICY AGENDA COMMITTEE ADDED A NUMBER OF NUMBER OF EMPLOYMENT ISSUES INCLUDING ADVOCATING THAT OUR STATE LEGISLATORS OUTLAW DISCRIMINATION AGAINST THE LGBT COMMUNITY IN HOUSING, EDUCATION, EMPLOYMENT AND PUBLIC ACCOMMODATIONS. OUR STATE LEGISLATURE HAS NOT BEEN WILLING TO MAKE THOSE CHANGES IN OUR LAW, AND I THINK THAT THIS CAMPAIGN SEEKS TO CIRCUMVENT THAT ROADBLOCK AND I FULLY SUPPORT IT AND I BELIEVE THAT IT'S LONG PAST TIME TO HELP THIS TYPE OF DISCRIMINATION. SO I INTEND TO SUPPORT THIS AND I HOPE EVERYBODY ELSE DOES AS WELL.
03:10:35.666: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER NELSON?
03:10:37.201: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I JUST WANTED TO BE ADDED AS A COSPONSOR. THAT'S ALL.
03:10:43.441: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
03:10:44.909: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A COSPONSOR. THANK YOU, VERY MUCH, SPONSORS FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND TO THE PETITION CIRCULATORS FOR DOING THE HARD WORK. THIS -- I DON'T KNOW -- CRISES HIGHLIGHTS WHAT HAPPENS WITH WE CREATE CRACKS FOR PEOPLE TO FALL THROUGH AND BASIC CIVIL RIGHTS IS SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD EXTEND TO ALL. HOV LOVLOVING OUR NEIGHBORS, NOR WHO THEY ARE OR WHO THEY LOVE, AND WHAT THEY IDENTIFY TO BE, IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO KEEP US ALL SAFE.
03:11:29.620: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
03:11:30.521: >> Councilmember Bannister:  I WOULD LIKE TO REQUEST TO BE ADDED AS A COSPONSOR ALSO. I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE A SPECIAL THANK YOU TO MICHELLE HUGHES FOR BRINGING THIS -- BEING THE FIRST PERSON, IT SEEMED TO BE CIRCULATING THIS AND GETTING THIS O ON THE AGENDA.
03:11:47.438: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
03:11:49.106: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. I ALSO WANT TO THANK MICHELLE HUGHES AND BE ADDED AS A COSPONSOR, BUT I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE I HEARD SOME CONCERN FROM MEMBERS OF THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY THAT WITHOUT ADEQUATE FUNDING THIS IS A PROPOSAL THAT COULD GO DOWN AND NOT EVERY COMMUNITY IS ANN ARBOR, AS WE SAW IN LANSING LAST WEEK. SO I KNOW THAT THAT -- I REALLY BELIEVE THAT WHAT WE SAW IN '18, THAT THIS WILL -- IF IT GETS ON THE BALLOT, IT THE PASS IF THE LEGISLATURE DOESN'T ACT FIRST, BECAUSE THEY WILL SCARED ABOUT DRIVING DEMOCRATIC TURNOUT BECAUSE OF IT. SO I'M HOPEFUL THAT IT WILL GO FORWARD, BUT I JUST WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I HAD THAT CONVERSATION IN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS AND THAT HOPEFULLY IN COMMITTING TO BE COSPONSORS THAT WILL ALSO BE COMMITTED TO WORKING TO GET THIS PASSED, IF THE SIGNATURES GET ON THE BALLOT.
03:12:50.001: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
03:12:50.968: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOUM. MAY YOU, MR. MAYOR. THANK YOU TO YOU, MAYOR, COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD AND SMITH, AND THANKS TO MICHELLE HUGHES FOR ALL OF YOUR WORK ON COLLECTING -- COLLECTING PETITION SIGNATURES TO PLACE THIS QUESTION ON THE BALLOT, AND IT REQUIRES A LOT OF WORK, OBVIOUSLY GIVEN THE VOLUME OF SIGNATURES THAT ARE REQUIRED. I ALWAYS THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO SUPPORT INITIATIVES TO PLACE QUESTIONS ON THE BALLOT, NO MATTER THE QUESTION. I CERTAINLY SUPPORT WHAT THIS IS TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH, AND I HOPE THAT IT'S ULTIMATELY SUCCESSFUL, AND THE BALLOT QUESTION IS SUPPORTED. BUT JUST IN GENERAL, IN TERMS OF PLACING QUESTIONS ON BALLOTS, WHICH IS WHAT THE BALLOT INITIATIVE IS ALL ABOUT, I REALLY THINK THAT'S A GOOD DEMOCRATIC THING TO DO, WHETHER IT'S -- YOU NAME THE ISSUE. WE HAVE HAD SOME LOCALLY, NONPARTISAN ELECTIONS. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE TO PUT THAT QUESTION ON THE BALLOT. THE LIBRARY LOT, I'M GLAD THAT MADE IT TO THE BALLOT. THAT TOOK A LOT OF EFFORT AND, AGAIN, I HOPE THAT THIS QUESTION DOES FIND A PLACE ON THE BALLOT, AND, AGAIN, THANKS, EVERYONE, WHO IS WORKING SO HARD OPEN THIS AND THANK YOU FOR ADDING MY NAME AS A SPONSOR.
03:14:19.256: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
03:14:20.224: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANKS. NO, I JUST -- I WOULD HOPE THAT THE FINAL WHEREAS CLAUSE IS TRUE AND I UNDERSTAND THAT EVEN IF IT WASN'T, THAT'S WHY THIS BALLOT LANGUAGE IS BEING BROUGHT. YOU KNOW, IT SAYS THAT THE RIGHTS THAT MOST RESIDENTS THAT OUR STATE AND NATION SUPPORT AND I KNOW THAT'S CERTAINLY TRUE FOR THE CITY AND THE COUNTY AND SO ON, AND I KNOW IT'S TRUE FOR OUR STATE AND NATION. IT'S THE NOTION THAT WE BELIEVE IT'S TRUE BY AGREEING ON THIS RESOLUTION. YOU KNOW, IT SENDS A DECENT MESSAGE THAT WE AGREE WITH THAT, AND SO, YOU KNOW, IT'S ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE. I JUST -- I DON'T KNOW. IT'S ODD. WE SAW LAST WEEK THE FRACKING PETITION MADE IT TO THE STATE. SO THAT WILL BE ON THE BALLOT. AND SO IT'S DEFINITELY GOOD NEWS THAT THIS PROCESS EXISTS TO PETITION THE GOVERNMENT FOR REDRESS AND SO I'M ALL FOR IT AND GOOD LUCK -- GOOD LUCK TO THE FOLKS OUT COLLECTING SIGNATURES. IT'S THE SIGNATURE -- YOU KNOW, IT'S TOUGH. IIT'S NOT GOING DOOR-TO-DOOR. AND HOPEFULLY THIS WILL BE LIFTED. SO THANK YOU.
03:15:45.843: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
03:15:47.044: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU FOR THE SECOND TIME TO SPEAK ON THIS. FIRST TIME I FORGOT TO THANK SPECIFICALLY MICHELLE HUGHES AS SHE'S BEEN THANKED SEVERAL TIMES ALREADY. I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE DISCUSSED HERE TONIGHT WITHOUT HER EFFORTS, AT LEAST HERE. BUT TO TALK ABOUT WHY IT'S ODD, IT'S ODD BECAUSE OUR LEADERSHIP AT THE FEDERAL AND THE STATE LEVEL FAILED MANY AMERICANS. SO WE'RE LEFT TO DO WHAT THE MOST DEMOCRATIC THING TO DO IS, GATHER PETITIONS AND GET IT ON THE BALLOT. IT'S A VERY BASIC FORM OF DEMOCRACY. SO I APPRECIATE COUNCILMEMBER LUMM'S REFRESHER, BUT IT'S ODD BECAUSE THERE'S SOME DEAF EARS ABOVE. AND THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO GET THINGS DONE SOMETIMES. SO THAT'S WHAT I THINK IS GOING ON HERE. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY.
03:16:51.275: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. I'M DELIGHTED THAT THIS WILL OBVIOUSLY MOVE FORWARD. WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PROTECT THE VULNERABLE MEMBERS OF THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY AND OBVIOUSLY CHANGING THE ELLIOTT LARSON ACT WOULD BE AN OUTSTANDING STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. IT'S, YOU KNOW INEXCUSABLE AS A SOCIETY THAT WE PERMIT THIS TYPE OF DISCRIMINATION AND WE SHOULD DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO DO STOP IT. FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] ALL OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. DC-3. A RESOLUTION DIRECTING THE PLANNING COMMISSION AND CITY ADMINISTRATOR TO EVALUATE SECTION 5.29.6 SITE PLANS OF CHAPTER 55 - UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE AND PROPOSE AMENDMENTS TO ADJUST SITE PLAN AUTHORITY THRESHOLDS AND IMPROVE THE COMMUNICATION OF REQUIREMENTS. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER AND SECONDED BY ACKERMAN. DISCUSSION OF DC-3. COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
03:17:55.539: >> Councilmember Eaton: THANK YOU. COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER AND I HAVE HAD SOME DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THIS RESOLUTION, AND I BELIEVE WE WOULD LIKE TO POSTPONE THIS SO THAT WE HAVE TIME TO TALK TO STAFF ABOUT THE PURPOSE THAT SHE HAD IN MIND AND THE LANGUAGE OF THE RESOLUTIONS. SO I WOULD MOVE TO POSTPONE THIS UNTIL THE FIRST MEETING IN JULY.
03:18:23.634: >> Mayor Taylor: SECONDED BY? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI. DISCUSSION POSTPONEMENT.
03:18:30.307: >> Councilmember Lumm: SECOND MEETING IN JULY?
03:18:34.244: >> Mayor Taylor: FIRST I BELIEVE HE SAID. COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER, YOUR HAND IS UP. DO YOU WISH TO SPEAK POSTPONEMENT.
03:18:40.818: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES -- I JUST WANTED TO -- NO, I SUPPORT POSTPONEMENT, BUT I WANTED TO GIVE A LITTLE UPDATE ABOUT WHAT THE ISSUE WAS. SO IN WARD 1, THIS IS A 200 HURON VIEW PROJECT, AND WE CAME TO FIND OUT ON THIS PROJECT -- AND I REFER EVERYONE TO A LETTER FROM TERESA AND BRAD ANGELINI, THAT'S ATTACHED TO THE PROPOSED RESOLUTION, WHERE THEY DESCRIBE WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS, BUT THEY HAD PURCHASED A PROPERTY, A MODEST SIZED PROPERTY DOWN ON HURONVIEW, AND THEN THEY WERE PLANNING TO DO SOME MODEST CHANGES TO IT, BUT THEN THEY GOT INTO COMPLEXITIES WHERE WHAT THEY THOUGHT WAS ACTUALLY AN ADMINISTRATIVE AMENDMENT TURNED OUT TO BE A FULL BLOWN SITE PLAN REQUIREMENT, AND THEY CAME TO FIND OUT THAT OUR SITE PLAN FAVORS LARGE PROJECTS RATHER THAN THE MORE SMALLER MODEST SIZED OFFICE BUILDINGS JUST HALF A MILLION OR A MILLION OR TWO OR SO, AND PART OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT COUNCIL MEMBER EATON AND I AND STAFF WILL BE TRYING TO WORK ON IS THAT IF YOU ARE A 1,000 SQUARE FEET BUILDING OR A 6,000 SQUARE FEET BUILDING, IF YOU ARE INCREASING THE SIZE MORE 10%, YOU TRIGGER THE SITE PLAN PROCESS. AND SO THEREIN LIES ABOUT WHERE IT FAVORS THE LARGE PROJECT BECAUSE IT'S 10% OF 1,000 SQUARE FEET, TRIGGERS IT, WHEREAS 6,000 SQUARE FEET, 10%, THEY CAN DO A LOT OF THINGS THAT DON'T ADD UP TO 10% ON THE BIGGER PROJECT. AND THE SITE PLAN PROCESS IS VERY EXPENSIVE BECAUSE THEN YOU GET INTO SIDEWALKS, STORMWATER, PARKING, FIRE TRUCK ACCESS, AND SO BY WORKING ON -- WHAT WE PREPARED HERE TONIGHT, WE FOUND OUT LAST NIGHT AT CAUCUS WAS NOT THE COMPLETE SOLUTION THAT IS NEEDED. SO COUNCILMEMBER EATON AND I AND ANY OTHER COUNCILMEMBERS -- COUNCILMEMBER LUMM OR OTHERS WHO WOULD LIKE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE DISCUSSION, WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO WORK ON THE SITE PLAN REVIEW DEFINITIONS AND THRESHOLDS FOR IN THERE AND POSSIBLY THIS 10% THAT RESULTS IN INEQUALITY FOR THE SMALLER PROJECTS.
03:21:46.937: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE POSTPONEMENT. ALL IN FAVOR POSTPONEMENT? [CHORUS OF AYES] ALL OPPOSED? POSTPONEMENT IS APPROVED. DC-4, RESOLUTION TO SUPPORT WASHTENAW COUNTY AND SHELTER ASSOCIATION OF WASHTENAW COUNTY (SAWC) AS A RESULT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AND APPROPRIATE $250,000 FOR CURRENT AND FUTURE COVID-19 SHELTER RESPONSE. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI. DISCUSSION OF DC-4. I GUESS I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THIS ON THE JUMP. AS EVERYBODY KNOWS, THE COVID-19 CRISIS IS HITTING MEMBERS OF THE -- THE HOMELESS MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY PARTICULARLY HARD. IT'S HITTING THEM HARD, OF COURSE BECAUSE OF THE DISRUPTION OF EVERYBODY'S LIFE, BUT IT FURTHER DISRUPTS OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE SERVICES AND SUPPORT TO MEMBERS OF THE HOMELESS COMMUNITY PREVIOUSLY AFFECTED AT THE DELONIS CENTER. WE HAVE THE -- THE COUNTY THAT IS TO SAY THE PRIMARY PROVIDER OF THE SERVICE. THE COUNTY HAS WORKED WITH PROPERTY OWNERS THROUGHOUT THE -- THROUGHOUT THE CITY AND THE COMMUNITY TO FIND ALTERNATE LOCATIONS FOR -- FOR MEMBERS OF THE HOMELESS COMMUNITY TO RESIDE DURING THE COURSE THE PANDEMIC, PLACES FOR THEM TO RECEIVE SERVICES, FOOD AND SERVICES IN THE MANNER CONSISTENT WITH SOCIAL DISTANCING WITH CARE AND SAFETY AND THE SAFETY OF OTHERS AND THAT IS UP AND RUNNING AND I'M PROUD OF THE WORK THAT THE COUNTY HAS DONE AND THE CITY'S ABILITY TO SUPPORT IT. CERTAINLY IN SOFT WAYS ASSOCIATED WITH SERVICE, BUT HERE, NOW, I'M -- THE RESOLUTION REQUESTS THAT THE CITY PROVIDE SOME ECONOMIC SUPPORT FOR THE PURPOSE. THIS IS A REASONABLE THING FOR US TO DO, TO, YOU KNOW, PROVIDE SUPPORT TO HELP THE NEEDIEST AMONG US AND I KNOW IT'S SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE VERY MUCH APPRECIATED FROM -- BY OUR GOOD FRIENDS AT THE COUNTY. THIS COMES LARGELY OUT OF A QUESTION AND CONVERSATION THAT I HAD WITH THE CHAIR OF THE COUNTY BOARD, CHAIR MORGAN AND IT WILL BE ON -- I THINK A GOOD THING FOR US ALL. SO I APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION AND SUPPORT. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
03:24:05.309: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANKS. I JUST HAD A QUESTION. I SEE THAT IN THE RESOLUTION THAT IT DISCUSSES THE PAYBACK FOR SOME OF THIS EXTENSION OF OUR FUNDS HERE WITH THE FEMA GRANTS AND SO ON, AND I'M JUST WONDERING -- I ASSUME THAT THOSE ARE CONTINGENT ON CONTINUING THE DECLARATION OF THE STATE OF -- THE STATES OF EMERGENCY WITH THE COUNTY AND THE CITY; IS THAT TRUE? SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T REVOKE THAT DECLARATION PREMATURELY. IS THIS WHAT I'M SEEING? WE WILL GET PAID BACK FOR THIS CONSIDERATION? IS THE CONSIDERATION THROUGH FEMA GRANTS.
03:24:56.760: >> City Admin. Crawford: WE HAVE TERESA GILLOTTI TO SPEAK ABOUT THAT.
03:25:04.901: >> SO AS IS WRITTEN RIGHT NOW, OR AS I SHOULD SAY, WHAT'S HAPPENED RIGHT NOW, IS BOTH THE COUNTY AND THE SHELTER ASSOCIATION HAVE BEEN INCURRING COSTS OVER THE PAST MONTH OR SO, MORE LIKE TWO MONTHS ON THE -- ON BEHALF OF THE SHELTER AS WE INCREASED THE SHELTER LOCATIONS, AND PAYING FOR ME MEALS AND THAT SORT OF THING. ALL OF THIS IS SUBJECT FOR REIMBURSEMENT UNDER FEMA. THE WAY THE RESOLUTION IS CURRENTLY WRITTEN, THE FIRST HALF OF THE FUNDS WOULD GO TO SUPPORT THINGS DIRECTLY AND I BELIEVE THAT WOULD BE REIMBURSABLE, AS LONG AS THOSE EXPENSES ARE TRACKED. THE SECOND HALF OF THE RESOLUTION WOULD BE THAT SOME OF THOSE CITY FUNDS COULD PROVIDE THE 25% MATCH, IN PARTICULAR, FOR THE SHELTER ASSOCIATION TO -- SO THEY CAN GET BASICALLY A FULL REIMBURSEMENT AND THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE FOR THE COUNTY AS WELL, BUT THAT WOULD BE -- IT WOULD ONLY BE AS NEEDED AT THAT -- AT THAT POINT IN TIME.
03:26:07.497: >> Councilmember Hayner:  AND IF I MAY, IN THE DESCRIPTIVE TEXT PRIOR TO IT, THE SUGGESTION IS THAT -- THAT THIS -- THESE COSTS ARE RUNNING $300,000 TO $600,000 A MONTH, FOR THESE SERVICES IS THAT WHAT I'M SEEING HERE?
03:26:22.312: >> I CAN GIVE YOU AN UPDATE ON THAT. I BASED THAT FIRST ESTIMATE -- I PUT THIS TOGETHER AT THE END OF THE WEEK LAST WEEK, ON WHAT WAS SUBMITTED -- YOU HAVE TO SUBMIT SORT OF PREAPPROVAL-TYPE DOCUMENTATION TO FEMA. I USED THE INITIAL ESTIMATES. I WENT BACK THROUGH IT TODAY WITH SOME OF THE STAFF THAT WERE INVOLVED IN IT, AND CURRENTLY FOR THE MONTH OF APRIL, ON THE COUNTY SIDE, THE BETTER ESTIMATE FOR THE EXPENSES FOR THE MONTH OF APRIL IS CLOSER TO ABOUT $175,000. THAT IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE IN THE MONTH OF MAY, AS WE ARE HOPING TO MOVE FROM FIVE DIFFERENT SHELTER LOCATIONS TO EXPANDED HOTEL AND SORT OF HAVING MORE FOLKS AT THE HOTEL AND LOTS OF THE SMALLER CONGREGATE SITES IN KEEPING DELON IS OPEN. THERE COULD BE A DECREASE IN COST OF STAFF HOPEFULLY, AND THE WHYED THAT YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO HAVE 24/7 STAFF FROM THE SHELTER ASSOCIATION AT THE SITE, POSSIBLY DOWN TO TWO OR THREE.
03:27:32.482: >> Councilmember Hayner: OKAY. I KNOW THIS IS YOUR THING AND I RESPECT YOUR JUDGMENT ON THIS. WHEN I SAW THAT $300,000 TO $600,000 A MONTH, WE ARE JUST GOING TO BUY THE HOTEL BEING RIGHT? , RIGHT?THAT'S A HUGE CASH BURN. YOU KNOW?
03:27:48.131: >> I DEFINITELY THOUGHT ABOUT BUYING HOTELS.
03:27:50.667: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I'M ALL FOR IT. WHEN YOU SEE THESE NUMBERS COMING BY -- AND I UNDERSTAND THAT STAFF IS PART OF THIS AND NECESSARY. I GET THAT. I JUST -- I JUST THOUGHT WOW! SHOULD WE NOTE THE DOWNPAYMENT AND BUY A HOTEL. PLEASE LET US KNOW IF THAT WOULD WORK BETTER FOR YOU. THANK YOU. ALL SET.
03:28:17.961: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
03:28:18.862: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. AND THANK YOU, MS. GILLOTTI FOR BEING HERE TO ANSWER SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS. I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES THAT WE ARE HEARING IN OUR COMMUNITY, PEOPLE CONCERNED ABOUT THE HOMELESS, THE MENTALLY ILL, THAT IF -- [ NO AUDIO ] TO TAKE CARE OF MANY OF OUR OWN PERSONAL NEEDS AND OUR FAMILIES' NEEDS BUT THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE SHADOWS WHO EXIST AND WHO DON'T -- CAN'T SHELTER IN PLACE WHEN THEY DON'T HAVE SHELTER. SO IT'S ONE ISSUE THAT I HAVE BEEN GETTING A LOT OF EMAILS AND CONCERNED WITH. MY QUESTION IS:  HOW LONG RIGHT NOW ARE WE PROJECTING THIS CONTINUE FOR -- YOU TALK ABOUT THE INCREASED COSTS AND FURTHER INCREASES IN THIS MONTH. SO IT'S TRENDING UP AND IT'S TRENDING OUT. I KNOW IT'S A FLUID SITUATION, BUT HOW SUSTAINABLE IS THE CURRENT FISCAL CAPACITY IN OUR -- IN OUR STRUCTURES AND OUR SYSTEMS? I MEAN, DO WE HAVE SOME ENDURANCE? ARE WE -- ARE WE GOING TO RUN OUT OF GAS SOON?
03:29:39.709: >> THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION. I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE ARE WORKING ON RIGHT NOW, OBVIOUSLY, WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY IS SAFE AND HAS THE ABILITY TO SHELTER IN PLACE, YOU KNOW, IT HAS THAT SECURITY AS COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER SORT OF INDICATED, AS LONG AS THERE'S A INDICATE OF EMERGENCY DECLARED, WE WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO THOSE FEMA FUNDS FOR REIMBURSEMENT FOR THE HOTELS AND THOSE ADDITIONAL COSTS. ONE THE THINGS THAT HAPPENING AT THE SAME TIME, IS SOME OF THE CARES ACT MONEY IS STARTING TO COME DOWN. AND WHAT WE ARE -- WHAT WE ARE LOOKING TO DO WITH A LOT OF THAT FUNDING, WHETHER IT'S THE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT OR COMMUNITY SERVICES BLOCK GRANT AND OTHER THINGS IS CREATE SORT OF A -- A WRAPAROUND STRATEGY SO THAT WE ARE NOT JUST INCREASING THE NUMBER OF SHELTERING SITES OR ROOMS AVAILABLE BUT WE ARE ACTUALLY GETTING PEOPLE INTO PERMANENT HOUSING BECAUSE THAT'S ULTIMATELY OUR GOAL AND I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE ON THAT. SO WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT, ONE, WE CAN HANDLE THIS IN THE IMMEDIATE TERM BUT WE ARE CONSTANTLY MOVING PEOPLE TO PERMANENT HOUSING. AND SO TO YOUR QUESTION, RIGHT NOW, WE'RE SORT OF PLANNING THROUGH, I WOULD SAY, THE SUMMER, AT HAVING TO HAVE SOME OF THIS INCREASED CAPACITY AND THEN WE'LL HAVE TO RE- REEVALUAO SEE HOW THINGS ARE GOING, AND IF WE HAVE A RESURGENCE OF THE VIRUS THAT WILL REQUIRE MORE SHELTER IN PLACE AGAIN. SO WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE ABLE TO ADJUST AT ANY POINT IN TIME BUT THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE ARE THINKING ABOUT AS WE PLAN THIS OUT.
03:31:08.698: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: WELL, TALKING WITH YOU HAS RAISED A COUPLE OF FURTHER QUESTIONS FOR THOUGHTS. TWO, IS FEMA GOING TO REIMBURSE US 100%? I APOLOGIZE, BUT WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THESE FURTHER EXPENDITURES ARE GOING TO BE APPLICABLE FOR GRANT MONEY? AND THEN I MIGHT AS WELL -- GO AHEAD. BUT THAT PART -- THAT WILL BE QUICK FOR YOU, BUT I'M SAYING YOU ARE PUTTING PEOPLE IN PERMANENT HOUSING AND THE OTHER SIDE OF THE EQUATION, WE ARE HEARING ABOUT PEOPLE LOSING HOUSING. SO ARE WE GOING TO LOSE THAT BATTLE? ARE WE GOING TO SEE AN INCREASE RATHER THAN A DECREASE AS YOU GO ON THROUGH THIS BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS?
03:31:58.648: >> YOU ARE ASKING ALL THE RIGHT QUESTIONS, RIGHT? AND SO WE ARE TRYING TO PLAN FOR -- ONE, FOR THE SHELTERING POPULATION THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW WE ARE HOVERING BETWEEN 140 AND 150. THAT THE SHELTER ASSOCIATION IS HOUSING BETWEEN THE FIVE DIFFERENT SITES. WE ARE ALSO CONCERNED AND TRYING TO PLAN AND PROVIDE SOME RENTAL ASSISTANCE AND MORTGAGE ASSISTANCE, HAVING THOSE THINGS AVAILABLE AS WE END UP WITH THE EVICTION MORATORIUMS COMING OFF IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS THAT WE CAN SUPPORT PEOPLE IN THE SHORT TERM. IT WILL BE SHORT TERM AND IT WILL PROBABLY BE TWO TO THREE MONTHS WORTH OF SPOT THAT WE CAN ASSIST WITH TO TRY TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM ENTERING THE HOMELESSNESS SYSTEM. YOU ARE RIGHT, IT'S A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT THINGS WE ARE TRYING TO DO. WE ARE TRYING TO PREVENT EVICTION AND HOMELESSNESS. WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT THE HOMELESS ARE GETTING HOUSED AND SHELTERING THOSE WHO NEED IT. YOU KNOW, WE DON'T KNOW THE FULL EXTENT OF IT. THAT'S THE -- YOU KNOW, THE BIGGEST UNKNOWN THAT WE ARE ALL FACING. WE THOUGH WHAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE TO US RIGHT NOW THROUGH THE STATE AND THE FEDERAL FUNDING. WE KNOW THERE'S A LOT GOING ON, ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND WE EXPECT THERE WILL BE ANOTHER CDBG ROUND AND ANOTHER EMERGENCY SOLUTIONS GRANT ROUND. THAT'S FUNDING THAT CAN ALSO ASSIST AROUND HOMELESSNESS AND HOUSING. AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO PLAN AHEAD FOR THAT, EVEN THINKING ABOUT CAN WE USE SOME OF THAT TO -- WE ARE TRYING TO THINK AHEAD WHAT OUR MANY DIFFERENT OPTIONS ARE AND HOW WE CAN BE ASSISTING. IT'S NOT AS CLEAR CUT YET AND I THINK IT'S STUFF THAT WE WILL BE LEARNING OVER THE NEXT WEEKS AND MONTHS.
03:33:30.173: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. I WILL RESERVE MY TIME FOR A SECOND TIME. THANKS.
03:33:36.045: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD?
03:33:40.483: >> Councilmember Griswold: THANKS FOR BEING HERE AND ANSWERING THREE QUESTIONS. EARLIER TONIGHT, MENTIONED THE WORD COLLABORATION AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY KEY DURING THIS DIFFICULT TIME. I RECEIVED A CALL FROM JASON MORGAN EARLIER TODAY. HE WANTED TO KNOW IF WE HAD ANY QUESTIONS THAT HE COULD ADDRESS BEFORE THE VOTE TONIGHT. I DID APPRECIATE THAT. I WANT TO SAY THAT THE HOTEL THAT'S BEING USED, I HAVE DRIVEN BY THERE AT LEAST TWICE A WEEK, AND I HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED ANY PROBLEMS. SECURITY HAS ALWAYS BEEN THERE. THAT'S A POSITIVE. ONE QUESTION, MANY OF OUR HOMELESS ARE EMPLOYED AND I'M JUST WONDERING IF WE ARE HAVING A PROBLEM NOW THAT AAATA HAS CUT BACK. WITH THE PEOPLE THAT ARE AT THE HOTEL, HAVE YOU EXPERIENCED A PROBLEM WITH TRANSPORTATION?
03:34:39.075: >> SO THE DIRECTOR OF THE SHELTER ASSOCIATION IS ON THIS CALL, AND I WILL HAND IT OVER TO DAN KELLY. HE CAN ANSWER THAT BETTER.
03:34:45.281: >> Councilmember Griswold: OKAY.
03:34:52.388: >> THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK TO THIS COUNCIL. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY. THAT JUST CHANGED RECENTLY, AND WE HAVE SEEN AN UPTICK IN OUR CASE MANAGERS HAVING TO COORDINATE TRANSPORTATION FOR OUR GUESTS THAT ARE EMPLOYED. WE HAVE A GUEST IN A SHELTER RIGHT NOW, DELOONIS WHO WORKS AT U OF M, AND WE HAVE COORDINATED A CAB. WE HAVE A CAB CONTRACT, BUT IT HAS AN IMPACT. IT'S STILL PRETTY NEW. I DON'T KNOW THE EXTENT OF IT, BUT I HAVE HEARD ANECDOTALLY, ABOUT A COUPLE OF CASES THAT HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY THAT CHANGE.
03:35:28.958: >> Councilmember Griswold: OKAY. THANKS FOR THE UPDATE.
03:35:32.795: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
03:35:33.997: >> Councilmember Bannister: THANK YOU, TERESA FOR JOINING US TONIGHT AND I WOULD LIKE TO REQUEST TO BE A COSPONSOR.
03:35:48.044: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
03:35:49.645: >> Councilmember Hayner: MS. GILLOTTI, WHILE I HAVE YOU THERE, I HAVE A QUESTION. I HAD THE NEED TO BE OVER ON PLATTE ROAD AND I SAW AS SOON AS EVERYTHING SHUT DOWN, THEY HAD THE 2 BY 12s HANGING OUT THE WINDOWS AND IT'S BEEN LIKE THAT EVER SINCE, OF COURSE, YOU KNOW THAT. WITH -- HOW IS IT THAT PUBLIC HOUSING CONSTRUCTION IS NOT CONSIDERED ESSENTIAL BUSINESS? DO WE -- DO WE KNOW WHEN THAT WILL START BACK UP AGAIN?
03:36:21.110: >> WE DO. ACTUALLY, WE'RE ABLE TO GET BACK INTO CONSTRUCTION ON THE 2nd. SO ACTUALLY LATER THIS WEEK, WE SHOULD SEE ALL CONSTRUCTION STARTING BACK UP. AND TO YOUR POINT, WE ACTUALLY -- WELL, YOU ALL ACTUALLY WERE ASSISTING WITH ADVOCACY TO TRY TO GET AFFORDABLE HOUSING STARTED SOONER. THAT DIDN'T QUITE WORK, BUT AT LEAST WE'LL GET BACK ON ALL CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS, MY UNDERSTANDING, CAN START AS OF MAY 7th.
03:36:45.535: >> Councilmember Hayner: OKAY. WELL, I HOPE IT'S NOT TOO SOON FOR THOSE GUYS. I HOPE THAT THE SITE MANAGERS HAVE THEM DISTANCED PROPERLY. IT'S TOUGH TO HANG SHEETROCK BY YOURSELF, AND HANGING SHEETROCK 8 FEET. I HATE SEEING IT FROZEN IN MACE. I UNDERSTAND THE PUBLIC HEALTH NECESSITY. THANKS FOR ANSWERING THAT.
03:37:12.595: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
03:37:14.230: >> Councilmember Eaton: THANK YOU. I WANT TO THANK THE MAYOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. I HAVE A FEELING THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING. SPENDING THAT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO DO TO HELP THOSE IN OUR COMMUNITY WHO ARE CHALLENGED BY THE -- THE IMPACTS OF THE RECESSION THAT'S JUST BEGINNING. BUT I SUPPORT THIS STRONGLY AND I WANT TO BE I COSPONSOR. THANK YOU.
03:37:39.155: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
03:37:40.790: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANKS, MR. MAYOR. YES, I THINK IT IS -- I AGREE, IT'S IMPORTANT TO DO WHAT -- FOR THE CITY TO DO WHAT IT REASONABLY CAN TO SUPPORT OUR RESIDENTS. WE -- WE APPROVED EMERGENCY FUNDING OF $200,000 FOR THE HOUSING COMMISSION AND THAT WAS APPROPRIATE. WE ALSO JUST APPROVED TEMPORARY RELIEF FOR TAXPAYERS AND THAT TOO WAS APPROPRIATE. AND THIS -- I THINK THIS $250,000 TO SUPPORT THE SHELTER AND OUR MOST NEEDED RESIDENTS IS CERTAINLY APPROPRIATE IS AS WELL. I DON'T FIND IT AT ALL SURPRISING THAT THE SHELTER ASSOCIATION HAS INCURRED UNANTICIPATED COSTS THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS, AND OBVIOUSLY THAT WILL CONTINUE. I JUST WANTED TO CONFIRM -- I DO THINK THE CITY SHOULD PAY ITS FAIR SHARE AND I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THAT. AND I THANK MS. GILLOTTI TONIGHT, TO FIELD ANY QUESTIONS AND TO PROVIDE US WITH A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF -- OF THE VARIOUS ACTIONS THAT YOU ARE TAKING, THINGS YOU ARE EXPLORING, TO ADDRESS ALL THE ISSUES SURROUNDING THE CONCERNS THAT WITH HOUSING FOLKS WHO ARE OTHERWISE ANOPIASED DURING THIS CRISIS. I DO THINK GOING FORWARD, IF YOU CAN KEEP US UPDATED, YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY EVERYBODY IS BUSY. YOU ARE VERY BUSY. BUT IN BETWEEN -- YOU KNOW, BECAUSE YOU ARE GOING TO BE COMING BACK I PRESUME. BUT UPDATES WOULD BE HELPFUL. AND SO I -- YOU KNOW, COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD, WE RECEIVED -- YOU KNOW, WE RECEIVED QUESTIONS FROM SOME NEIGHBORS ABOUT THE HOTEL IN THE SECOND WARD THAT'S BEING UTILIZED AND IT SOUNDS LIKE HALF OR SO OF THE SHELTER -- THE PEOPLE WE ARE SHELTERING ARE AT THAT PARTICULAR HOTEL. AND YOU SAID THAT THIS WILL CONTINUE -- BECAUSE I FIELDED QUESTIONS ABOUT, YOU KNOW, THE PLANS GOING FORWARD. IT SOUNDS LIKE THE PLANNING THERE IS TO UTILIZE THAT THROUGH THE SUMMER THEN?
03:40:11.374: >> SO I'M HOPING THAT WE WILL KNOW BY THE END OF THIS WEEK. WE HAVE BEEN TALKING TO THE U OF M ABOUT THE USE OF DORM SPACE. IT'S BEEN AN ONGOING CONVERSATION, AND I THINK WE ARE AT THE POINT WHERE WE WILL GET A DECISION WITH THEM AND IF NOT, WE MAY HAVE TO PROCEED ANYWAY SO WE DON'T USE THE DORM, WE WOULD BE USING MORE HOTEL SPACE INSTEAD OF TAKING OVER THE ENTIRE HOTEL THAT YOU ARE REFERRING TO. SO WE HOPE TO START TO DO THE TRANSITION AND THAT WOULD HELP TO CONSOLIDATE ALL THE SERVICES. AND IT WOULD HELP WITH COMMUNICATION COORDINATION AND THE STAFFING LEVELS WE TALKED ABOUT.
03:40:55.484: >> Councilmember Lumm: ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
03:40:58.120: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
03:40:58.988: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU FOR THE SECOND TIME TO SPEAK ON THIS, AND MY COLLEAGUES WEIGHING IN ON IT. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, KIND OF TOUCHING ON SOME THINGS THAT I'M THINKING ABOUT AND THAT'S, YOU KNOW, OUR EFFORTS HERE IN THE INCREMENTAL COSTS AND RESPONDING TO COVID-19. BETWEEN THE HOUSING COMMISSION AND OUR TAX LENIENCY AND PERHAPS THE PASSAGE OF THIS, WE'RE AT THREE-QUARTERS OF A MILLION DOLLARS ALREADY. WE HAVEN'T EVEN STARTED, REALLY. SO IT'S GOING TO BE TIME TO WATCH OUR DOLLARS AND IN THAT SPIRIT, AND THE SPIRIT OF A LOT OF THINGS, THE SPIRIT OF HELPING AND THE SPIRIT OF BEING RESPONSIBLE, I WOULD LIKE TO ADD A FOURTH RESOLVE CLAUSE OR A FIFTH RESOLVE CLAUSE, I'M SORRY WHEN I SENT IT TO THE CLERK, I SAID IT WOULD BE THE FOURTH BUT IT WOULD ACTUALLY BE FIFTH RESOLVE CLAUSE IN THIS. AND THAT'S TO ASK FOR AN EXPENSE REPORT OF SORTS OF WHERE THIS FUNDING IS GOING. MS. BEAUDRY, I DON'T KNOW IF IT IS POSSIBLE TO GET THAT OUT.
03:42:33.516: >> Clerk Beaudry: I JUST SENT IT. I CAN READ IT IF YOU LIKE.
03:42:35.851: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES, IF YOU COULD. THAT WOULD HELP EVERYONE.
03:42:43.826: >> Clerk Beaudry: ATHE CITY ADMINISTRATOR SHOULD DELIVER TO COUNCIL WITHIN A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME, AN EXPENSE REPORT DETAILING THE USE OF THESE FUNDS.
03:42:55.004: >> Mayor Taylor: SECONDED BY? COUNCILMEMBER LUMM. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, YOU STILL HAVE THE FLOOR.
03:43:01.844: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I DON'T WANT TO MICROMANAGE BUT I WANT TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TAXPAYERS DOLLARS AND I UNDERSTAND SOME OF THIS COULD BE GIVEN BACK BY FEMA BUT I AM REMINDED OF WHO IS IN POWER AND MANY OTHER CORPORATIONS THAT HE'S BANKRUPT BEFORE. IS IT POSSIBLE TO GET SOMETHING LIKE THIS? IS THERE ANY TYPE OF HESITATION OR TROUBLES WITH GETTING SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO COUNCIL?
03:43:38.214: >> I DON'T THINK SO. I MENTIONED IN THE RESOLUTION, WE WILL BE DOING AN MOU WITH SHELTER TO CLARIFY ROLES IN WHICH EXPENSES ARE BEING COVERED BY THE COUNTY AND ALSO BY THE SHELTER AND THEN AS PART OF THAT, WE WILL BE COLLECTING THOSE EXPENSES AND MAKING SURE WE CAN PRORATE IT IN THAT WAY. I DON'T THINK THAT WOULD BE A PROBLEM. WHAT >> Councilmember Ramlawi: WHAT WOULD BE A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME?
03:44:09.278: >> FOR -- I DON'T KNOW -- I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY WHAT YOU WOULD BE THINKING ABOUT. MAYBE QUARTERLY WOULD PROBABLY BE EASIEST AND THEN MAYBE EVERY TWO MONTHS IF YOU WANTED TO, DAN KELLY AND I WERE TALKING EARLIER. THEY HAVEN'T FINISHED THEIR PAYROLL FOR THE MONTH OF APRIL YET. SO WE PROBABLY WOULDN'T GET INTO LOOKING AT THAT FOR A FEW MORE WEEKS SINCE WE WILL ALWAYS LAG BEHIND JUST A LITTLE BIT. SOMETHING ON THAT CADENCE WOULD BE ALL RIGHT.
03:44:36.005: >> Mayor Taylor: PERHAPS THIS IS FRIENDLY? DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY OBJECTION TO IT BEING FRIENDLY? FRIENDLY. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
03:44:47.750: >> Councilmember Lumm: I WANT TO THANK COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI AND MS. GILLOTTI, THAT WILL BE HELPFUL INFORMATION. AND WE CAN ALL PLAN TOO. AND THE PUBLIC HEARING FOR THE BUDGET. WE SPOKE ABOUT THE COUNTY HEALTH AND SAFETY MILLAGE AND THIS RECOMMENDATION IS TO FOUND THIS $250,000 FROM THE GENERAL FUND FUND BALANCE AND HE WOULD LIKE TO REMIND US ALL THAT THE COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH THAT THOSE ARE TAXPAYER DOLLARS, OBVIOUSLY, GENERAL FUND DOLLARS BUT THAT'S ANOTHER FUNDING SOURCE. WE ALLOCATED THAT DIFFERENTLY AND PROVIDED DIRECTION ON HOW THAT MONEY SHOULD BE USED GOING FORWARD, BUT I THINK IT WOULD CERTAINLY BE A SUITABLE USE TO DIRECT FOR THIS KIND OF SUPPORT JUST -- JUST PLA PLANTING THAT . THANKS.
03:46:03.692: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
03:46:05.728: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  CAN I JUST BE ADDED AS A SPONSOR AND THANK YOU, MAYOR FOR BRINGING IT FORTH.
03:46:11.033: >> Mayor Taylor: ABSOLUTELY. FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] ALL OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. WHERE AM I? MY APOLOGIES.
03:46:29.618: >> DC-5.
03:46:29.985: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. DC-5, RESOLUTION TO PROMOTE SAFE SOCIAL DISTANCING OUTDOORS IN ANN ARBOR. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD, AND SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRAND. DISCUSSION OF DC-5, COUNCILMEMBER -- WHO IS GOING TO DO IT? SOMEONE RAISE YOUR HAND. COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
03:46:55.310: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. THIS WAS A REALLY UNUSUAL AND I THINK PRODUCTIVE PROCESS THAT GOT US TO WHERE WE ARE FOR DC-5 THAT I THINK INCLUDED COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD, PEOPLE FROM THE COMMUNITY WHO PROVIDED FEEDBACK TO ME ABOUT CONCERNS THEY HAD WITH THE RESOLUTION AND LONG-TIME ADVOCATES FOR THIS ISSUE IN IN GENERAL SINCE WE HAD THE STAY AT HOME ORDER. SO I WANT TO THANK ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE AND I THINK WE WERE ABLE WITH THE HELP OF MR. HUPY AND MR. CRAWFORD TO HAVE A COUPLE OF MEETINGS. ONE ON SATURDAY MORNING AND ONE MIDDAY TODAY, THAT ENABLED US TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE WE ARE TODAY. YOU KNOW, I THINK THERE ARE SOME COMPROMISES ON BOTH SIDES HERE. FOR ME, THE ONE THAT IS PROBABLY THE BIGGEST ONE IS, THAT YOU KNOW, IT WOULD BE MY PERSONAL PREFERENCE TO NOT COME BEFORE COUNCIL FOR -- TO HAVE ANY OF THESE RECONFIGURATIONS APPROVED BUT I THINK WE REACHED A GOOD COMPROMISE POINT WHERE YOU DON'T HAVE TO COME BACK BEFORE COUNCIL FOR A LOCAL STREET RECONFIGURATION, THAT THOSE CAN GO FORWARD ADMINISTRATIVELY, THAT WE CAN MOVE FORWARD WITH SOME PILOTS THAT WE DIDN'T -- I THINK THIS WAS A LOT OF CONCERN ABOUT THE INITIAL DATE OF A REPORT COMING BACK JUNE 15th, BEFORE WE COULD DO ANYTHING. AND THAT SET OFF SOME ALARMS. A THINK MUCH OF WHAT WE HAVE BEEN ASKING, STAFF HAS DONE ALREADY AND I'M HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN GET A REPORT BACK. BUT IF WE ARE LOOKING TO DO THINGS ON NONRESIDENTIAL STREETS, WE WILL HAVE JUST A LITTLE MORE IN THE WAY OF GUIDELINES FROM STAFF. AND A CONVERSATION THAT WILL NOT BE TOO CONTROVERSIAL BEFORE THIS BODY, BUT WILL BE INFORMED BY STAFF IN BEST PRACTICES. SO THANK YOU, EVERYONE, AND YOU ESPECIALLY COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD FOR ALLOWING ME TO PARTICIPATE IN THESE DISCUSSIONS. TO COUNCILMEMBER SMITH, WHO I HAD REALLY PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH AND TO THE OTHER COSPONSORS.
03:49:20.189: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
03:49:21.557: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WANT TO SECOND EVERYTHING THAT COUNCILMEMBER GRAND SAID. I WANT TO APOLOGIZE FOR THE LATE POSTING OF THE REVISED DC-5, BUT REALLY THIS CONVE CONVERSATION D ON SOCIAL MEDIA ON APRIL 4th, WHEN SOMEONE MENTIONED A PROBLEM WITH A PERSON WITH A DISABILITY BEING CROWDED ON THE SIDEWALK AND OBVIOUSLY, IF SOMEONE IS IN A WHEELCHAIR, THEY CANNOT EASILY MOVE OUT OF THE WAY OR MOVE OFF OF THE SIDEWALK. SO THIS HAS BEEN AN ACTIVE DISCUSSION ON SOCIAL MEDIA SINCE THEN. AND WHILE THIS PROCESS TOOK A LOT OF STAFF TIME, EMAILS WERE STILL BEING SENT ABOUT 11:00 ON SUNDAY NIGHT. I THINK THAT IT WAS A GOOD LEARNING EXPENSE BECAUSE I THINK WE ESTABLISHED A PROCESS THAT WE CAN USE FOR OTHER CORONAVIRUS-RELATED PROBLEMS AND OPPORTUNITIES MOVING FORWARD. SO I DON'T SEE IT BEING AN EXCESSIVE AMOUNT OF TIME SINCE THERE WAS SO MUCH OF A LEARNING CURVE THAT WE HAD TO JUMP OVER, WHATEVER. I DO WANT TO MENTION THAT THERE IS A LOT OF MISINFORMATION OUT THERE IN THE MEDIA, AND WE HEARD ABOUT HOW OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA, HAS ALREADY CLOSED 74 MILES OF STREETS. WELL, THEY DIDN'T REALLY CLOSE THE STREETS EXCEPT TO THROUGH TRAFFIC, AND BY HAVING A STREET LOCAL TRAFFIC ONLY, IT DEFINITELY SLOWS DOWN THE AMOUNT OF VEHICULAR TRAFFIC. IT MINIMIZES THE AMOUNT OF VEHICULAR TRAFFIC, AND SO PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO WALK AND TYKELE IN THE STREET MORE SAFELY THAN THEY WOULD OTHERWISE. SO AS WE MOVE FORWARD, WE NEED TO BE VERY CAREFUL OF OF THE LANGUAGE WE ARE USING. IT WILL BE VERY COMPLICATED ON OUR DOWNTOWN STREETS. IF WE MAKE ONE STREET LOCAL TRAFFIC ONLY, WE HAVE TO LOOK AND SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE ERR PARALLEL STREETS AND SO I THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO COME BACK TO COUNCIL BECAUSE WE WILL HAVE TO WORK WITH THE DDA. WE WILL HAVE TO WORK WITH A NUMBER OF OTHER ENTITIES OUR AMAZON AND DELIVERY SERVICE VOLUME WILL PROBABLY INCREASE AS WE GO THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC. THERE ARE A LOT OF MOVING VARIABLES THAT WE NEED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT BECAUSE THE ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO CREATE A SAFE ENVIRONMENT, IN FACT A SAFER ENVIRONMENT THAN WE HAVE RIGHT NOW. SO THANK YOU SO EVERYONE INVOLVED.
03:52:11.026: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
03:52:12.027: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. THIS CAME, OBVIOUSLY A LITTLE BAIT. IT'S BEEN DISCUSSED IN LOOSE TERMS AND CONVERSATIONS UP TO THIS POINT. AS I SEE IT YOU NO, I WOULD LIKE TO OFFER ANOTHER RESOLVE CLAUSE IN THIS, AND I APOLOGIZE IF IT'S NOT GRAMMATICALLY PROPER. FREEL FEEL FREE TO EDIT IT. I WILL SEND IT TO OUR CLERK AGAIN, MS. BEAUDRY. AND THAT IS TO INCLUDE THE DOWNTOWN MERCHANTS ASSOCIATIONS.
03:52:53.468: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES.
03:52:55.871: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I FEEL THAT THE DOWNTOWN BUSINESSES IS NOT EVEN GOING TO FEEL IT. IT'S A REALITY. WE HAVE BEEN VOICERRATED. THIS IS NOT JUST A COUPLE OF WEEK SITUATION. THIS IS GOING TO BE A GENERATIONAL THING. AND I THINK WE NEED TO INCLUDE ALL THE DOWNTOWN MERCHANT ASSOCIATIONS. WHERE WE ARE SEEING SOCIAL DISTANCING ISSUES IS IN THE DOWNTOWN AREAS, THE DDA AREA AND THE PARKS. I THINK WE CAN PRETTY MUCH ISOLATE THOSE AS BEING THE STICKING POINTS, THE CHOKE POINTS. I THINK WE CAN HANDLE THINGS IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS RELATIVELY WELL AS WE ALL KNOW WHEN WE GO KNOCKING ON DOORS, OUR COMMUNITY -- THE NEIGHBORHOODS KNOW EACH OTHER VERY WELL AND WHERE WE HAVE ISSUES ARE PLACES LIKE THE DOWNTOWN AND DIAG. SO I THINK IT'S CRITICAL AS WELL TO THE FACT THAT THESE BUSINESSES ARE STRUGGLING. MANY OF THEM WON'T SURVIVE. MANY NEW ONES WILL COME ONLINE AND THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO FOSTER SOME NEW GROWTH AS UNFORTUNATELY, THE FOREST HAS BEEN BURNT COUNSEL. AND SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE MERCHANTS HAVE A CRITICAL SAY IN WHAT WE DO WITH OUR STREETS AND SIDEWALKS GOING TO.
03:54:38.507: >> Mayor Taylor: SO THE ADDED RESOLVE CLAUSE. RESOLVED THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR SHOULD GET INPUTS IN THE PROCESS IN ESTABLISHING SOCIAL DISTANCING AS IT AFFECTS THE DDA DISTRICT.
03:54:55.657: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I CAN WORK ON IT. I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT IT UNTIL THE LAST SECOND.
03:55:01.229: >> Mayor Taylor: NO WORRIES.
03:55:05.400: >> I THOUGHT ABOUT IT.
03:55:07.502: >> Mayor Taylor: SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN. IS THAT FRIENDLY?
03:55:13.408: >> Councilmember Grand: IF THERE'S NO OBJECTION -- MR. CRAWFORD HAS HIS HAND RAISE.
03:55:19.514: >> City Admin. Crawford: I WANTED TO POINT OUT THANK YOU FOR THE AMENDMENT. STAFF HAS BEEN MEETING WITH THE MERCHANT ASSOCIATIONS AND THEY ARE WORKING ON SOME CUSTOMIZED PLANS BECAUSE ALL OF THEIR NEEDS ARE NOT THE TAME AND SO THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING ON SOME IDEAS THAT WILL COME FORWARD I ANTICIPATE FAIRLY SOON.
03:55:43.538: >> Councilmember Grand: CAN I JUST?
03:55:45.140: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND?
03:55:46.541: >> Councilmember Grand: WOULD YOU PREFER THAT BE A WHEREAS BECAUSE THAT'S ALREADY ONGOING?
03:55:50.579: >> City Admin. Crawford: IT'S FINE. IT'S FINE.
03:55:53.215: >> Councilmember Grand: JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE. I THINK THAT SOUNDS LIKE --
03:55:59.788: >> Mayor Taylor: I ASSUME THAT'S FRIENDLY. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
03:56:02.224: >> Councilmember Lumm: IT'S A RESOLVE CLAUSE, RIGHT?
03:56:06.428: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
03:56:07.128: >> Councilmember Lumm: RESOLVE CLAUSES ARE MUCH MORE FORCEFUL. WHEREAS CLAUSES ARE NICE STATEMENTS BUT THEY DON'T DO MUCH OF ANYTHING. I'M GLAD THAT COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI BROUGHT THIS FORWARD AND IT SHOULD STAND  AS A RESOLVE CLAUSE.
03:56:35.824: >> Mayor Taylor: IS IT FRIENDLY? YES. COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
03:56:40.095: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WANT TO THANK NICK HUTCHINSON AND CRAIG HUPY AND TOM CRAWFORD AND OUR CITY ADMINISTRATOR STEVEN POSTEMA.
03:56:51.940: >> City Admin. Crawford: AND RAYMOND HOUSE.
03:56:53.908: >> Councilmember Griswold: OH, RAYMOND HOUSE IS HERE. OH, RAYMOND, SORRY. OH, YOU ARE MOVING AROUND ON THE SCREEN.
03:57:02.751: >> Councilmember Griswold: THANKS EVERYONE!
03:57:19.434: >> Mayor Taylor: HAWN COIN MEMBER HAYNER.
03:57:21.369: >> Councilmember Hayner:  AS MANY ARE APAIR, THIS CAME TO OUR NOTICE AS COUNCILWOMAN GRISWOLD, SHE STARTED LOOKING AT THIS IN APRIL. AND WE GOT A BUNCH OF GRIEF ABOUT MEMO THAT WAS CIRCULATED INTERNALLY AND TO THE TRANSPORTATION STAFF THAT WAS NEVER TENT TO US. AND WE GOT GRIEF FOR NOT NEVER ACTING ON SOMETHING WE DIDN'T RECEIVE. I GOT MY COPY OF IT FROM RYAN STANTON. I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO DO THIS. I THINK IF THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION WOULD HAVE PUT TOGETHER THE LIST OF STREETS THAT WERE APPROPRIATE, WE COULD HAVE ACTED ON THAT ALSO. NOW I LOOK AT OAKLAND. WITH EWE ARE NOT OAKLAND. THEY CLOSE ONE STREET AND IT'S EQUIVALENT TO ONE-QUARTER OF OUR STREET MILES. WE ARE NOT LIKE THAT. WE HAVE THE FREEWAY RING AND WE HAVE RESTRICTIONS WITH BRIDGES AND OTHER THINGS LIKE THAT. I'M NOT SURE WHAT WILL COME BACK. IS THERE -- IN THAT APRI APRIL 1st MEMO, IT -- YOU DIDN'T KIND OF -- IT DIDN'T HAVE A LIST. IS THERE ANY NOTION OF WHAT IS, YOU KNOW GOING TO BE COMING FORWARD? DO WE HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT TYPES OF STREETS WOULD BE APPROPRIATE FOR THIS? I MEAN, I LOVE THE REDUCED TRAFFIC ON PONTIAC TRAIL, BUT I KNOW THAT THAT'S NOT A STREET THAT WILL CLOSE. I JUST -- I'M TRYING TO GET A SENSE -- I WAS LOOKING AT A MAP. IT CAME UP AND I LOOKED AT WHAT LOCATELAND HAD DONE AND OAKLAND HAD TAKEN A CATEGORY OF STREETS AND A COUPLE OF OTHER CITIES HAD DONE THIS WHERE THEY TOOK A TYPE OF STREET AND THE CLOSEST ONE WE HAD TO IT WERE THE NEIGHBORHOOD BIKE PATHS. I LOOKED AT WHAT THOSE STREETS WERE TO GET IT STARTED AS WHAT KIND OF CATEGORY WE WOULD USE. I'M JUST WONDERING DO WE HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT STREETS WILL FALL UNDER THIS AND HOW IT'S GOING TO BE PUT FORWARD? WHAT TYPE OF SIGNAGE WILL BE ROLLED OUT OR ANY OF THAT.
03:59:27.061: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. CRAWFORD?
03:59:27.695: >> City Admin. Crawford: YES, THESE ARE GREAT QUESTIONS BUT THIS IS PART OF WHAT STAFF WOULD BE COMING BACK WITH. WE MIGHT WANT TO SAVE THAT FOR ANOTHER DISCUSSION.
03:59:33.134: >> Councilmember Hayner:  ALL RIGHT. OKAY. I WONDERED IF THERE WAS -- BECAUSE THAT THING HAD BEEN OUT THERE SINCE APRIL 14th. DO WE HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT IS HAPPENING? I WILL WAIT WITH EVERYBODY ELSE THANK YOU.
03:59:54.689: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND. YOU ARE ON MUTE. COUNCILMEMBER GRAND, YOU ARE ON MUTE.
03:59:59.327: >> Councilmember Grand: 20 SECONDS. CUT THROUGH STREETS IN NEIGHBORHOODS WILL PROBABLY BE SOME OF THE FIRST THAT WE'LL SEE IN THIS PILOT BECAUSE THAT SEEMS TO BE WHERE THERE'S A LOT OF DESIRE THAT WE HAVE HEARD FROM THE COMMUNITY. SO LOCALS BRINGING CUT THROUGH STREETS TO THE NEIGHBORHOODS TO LOCAL TRAFFIC ONLY, PROBABLY TOPS. SO THOSE WOULD BE SOME OF THE FIRST THAT YOU WOULD SEE. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO POINT OUT, IT'S MY BELIEF THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION HAS NOT MET SO THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DEVELOP A LIST FROM THAT COMMISSION. SO I THINK THAT'S -- THAT PARTIALLY EXPENDS MY BELIEF. WE HAVEN'T HEARD A FORMAL RECOMMENDATION FROM THEM, BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO MEET.
04:00:40.602: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD -- I'M SORRY. LUMM?
04:00:46.074: >> Councilmember Lumm: SO FOLLOWING ON WHAT COUNCILMEMBER GRAND JUST SAID. I WOULD LIKE TO ADD TO COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI'S AMENDMENT. I'M LOOKING TO IT. IT WAS GIVEN TO US BY MS. BEAUDRY. SIMILARLY, I HAVEN'T SENT ALLYING. IT'S AMENDMENT WAS TO REQUIRE THAT THE INTERESTED DOWNTOWN BUSINESS ASSOCIATIONS BE ENGAGED IN THESE DECISIONS. NOW WE ARE TALKING ABOUT NEIGHBORHOODS. I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A SIMILAR RESOLUTION TO INSTRUCT STAFF TO ENGAGE THE IMPACTED NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATION ON ANY OF THESE RECOMMENDATIONS. SO I WOULD LIKE TO UTILIZE COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI'S RESOLVE, THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR SHALL SOLICIT INPUT FROM THE IMPACTED NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATION IN THE PROCESS OF ESTABLISHING SOCIAL DISTANCING AS IT AFFECTS THE IMPACTED NEIGHBORHOOD.
04:01:55.076: >> Councilmember Grand: THAT'S NOT FRIENDLY TO ME.
04:01:56.411: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE A SECOND? SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER EATON. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, YOU STILL HAVE THE FLOOR.
04:02:02.050: >> Councilmember Lumm: THAT AHE IS IT.
04:02:06.287: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. CRAWFORD IS THAT PART OF THE SOP?
04:02:10.224: >> City Admin. Crawford: YOU KNOW, I WILL ASK STAFF. I DON'T KNOW THAT WE HAVE DISCUSSED THAT SUSPECT OF IT YESTERDAY. WE ARE STILL WORKING -- I MEAN, I THINK THEY WILL WORK ON A RECOMMENDATION.
04:02:24.439: >> Councilmember Lumm: I WAS DOING THAT BECAUSE COUNCILMEMBER GRAND TOOK OUT STREETS.
04:02:34.048: >> City Admin. Crawford: YOU KNOW, MAYOR TO RESPOND TO COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, MAYBE WE GO THE OTHER DIRECTION AND SEE IF STAFF HAVE QUESTIONS THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR YOU GUYS TO GIVE INPUT ON. LET ME CHARACTERIZE DISCUSSIONS AS THE NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS IF THERE WAS AN INTEREST IN PEOPLE ON THEIR STREET TO HAVE IT ADJUSTED IN SOME WAY AND THEN THAT MIGHT BE RECEIVED BY STAFF AND CONSIDERED RATHER THAN GOING THROUGH A NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATION, IT COULD BE OPEN TO PEOPLE ON THEIR STREETS AND SEE WHAT WE GET AND THEN SEE HOW WE MOVE FORWARD. ON THE DOWNTOWN THAT WOULD BE DIFFERENT. IT WOULD BE DRIVEN BY STAFF AND DISCUSSIONS WITH THE RELATED PARTIES AND CONSIDERATION OF SOLID WASTE PICKUP AND WE WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT THAT A LITTLE BIT.
04:03:28.636: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU. I WILL WITHDRAW THE RESOLVE CLAUSE. WE HAVE THE PUBLIC SERVICES, THE GARBAGE PICKUP AND OF COURSE EMERGENCY SERVICES, POLICE FIRE, HVA ACCESS ISSUES THAT, YOU KNOW, SIM PARTICULARLY ARE NECESSARY CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE -- YOU NAME THE STREET.
04:03:55.063: >> Mayor Taylor: THE AMENDMENT HAS BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED. DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY OBJECTION TO ITS -- SO IT'S THE BODY -- CAN WE JUST -- DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY OBJECTION TO IT BEING WITHDRAWN? THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED LAST WEEK WITH MR. RAMLAWIS.
04:04:34.302: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM. I'M NOT A SOCIAL MEDIA PERSON. SHE GOT A FAIR AMOUNT OF CRITICISM AND I DON'T KNOW WHY BECAUSE SHE WAS WORKING ON. THIS I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COUNCIL MEMBERS FOR WORKING THROUGH THE DUELING RESOLUTIONS THAT WERE INITIALLY PLACED ON THE AGENDA. AND I WOULD LIKE TO THANK STAFF FOR HELPING THE COUNCILMEMBERS WORK THROUGH ALL OF THAT. BUT COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD WAS REALLY THE LEADER IN ALL OF THIS AND I WOULD LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE HER EFFORTS.
04:05:08.002: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. MR. CRAWFORD?
04:05:11.606: >> City Admin. Crawford: COSORRY TO KEEP PIPING IN ON THIS. IF I UNDERSTAND THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS, LET ME SEE IF I GET ANY REACTION FROM COUNCIL, IT'S TO PURSUE THESE AND NEIGHBORHOOD AND SOME SELECTED ONTOWN AREAS AND THE PURPOSE IS TO -- WHERE THERE IS SOCIAL DISTANCING IS A CHALLENGE FROM A PEDESTRIAN'S PERSPECTIVE, THAT THAT -- THAT THAT IS ADDRESSED, AND SECONDLY, IF THERE'S A CONNECTION FOR BIKING, THAT IT COULD BE DOB, BOTH OF THOSE -- COULD BE DONE, BOTH OF THOSE WOULD BE OBJECTIVES THAT YOU WOULD WANT ADDRESSED. OKAY. THAT'S WHERE WE ARE HEADED UNLESS I HEAR OTHERWISE.
04:05:52.213: >> Mayor Taylor: ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU. FURTHER DISCUSSION?
04:05:55.249: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I JUST WANTED TO GIVE STAFF AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE STATEMENTS IF THEY WOULD LIKE TO OR ASK ANY QUESTIONS. THEN THE OTHER THING IS I DIDN'T REALLY FEEL LIKE I WAS BEING CRITICIZED SO MUCH AS JUST ENGAGED IN A VERY PRODUCTIVE DISCUSSION.
04:06:28.716: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] ALL OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. DC-6. RESOLUTION TO APPROVE A REQUEST FROM THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN FOR A NEW RESORT CLASS C LIQUOR LICENSE WITH A DANCE/ENTERTAINMENT PERMIT TO BE LOCATED AT 500 E. STADIUM BOULEVARD. MOVED BY LUMM AND RAMLAWI. DISCUSSION OF DC-6. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
04:06:54.742: >> Councilmember Lumm: FIRST, I WOULD LIKE TO LET EVERYONE KNOW THAT MR. REIGN, THE UNIVERSITY COMMUNITY RELATIONS DIRECTOR IS STANDING BY AND ON THE LINE. THANK YOU, MS. BEAUDRY FOR PROMOTING HIM SO HE CAN SPEAK IF ANYONE HAS ANY QUESTIONS. BRIEFLY, I WILL SAY THIS ITEM COMES FROM THE COUNCIL LIQUOR LICENSE REVIEW COMMITTEE. WE MET LAST THURSDAY AND IT'S TO APPROVE A REPORT FROM THE U OF M FOR A LIQUOR LICENS AND DANCE ENTERTAINMENT PERMIT AT THE U OF M GOLF COURSE.
04:07:34.882: >> Mayor Taylor: I HAVE MUTED HIM FOR THE TIME BEING.
04:07:37.952: >> Councilmember Lumm: I WILL QUICKLY FINISH. THIS APPROVAL GO ALLOW THE U OF M TO CONTINUE SERVING ALCOHOL TO GUESTS IN THE CLUB HOUSE AND ALLOW GOLFERS TO PURCHASE ALCOHOL AS WELL. ON THIS POLICE THE FINE PLANNING HAVE REVIEWS THE APPLICATION AND DO NOT HAVE ANY OBJECTIONS. THIS WAS A LITTLE UNUSUAL. THIS WOULD NOT ORDINARILY COME TO US, BUT THE HE SENT SOME BACKGROUND ORGANIZATION. THE MHCC NOTIFIED UNIVERSITY THAT THIS WOULD LIKE THE UNIVERSITY TO HAVE THE LOCAL APPROVAL FOR THIS LIQUOR LICENSE. THEY WANT A CONSISTENT RECORD AND PROCESS IN PLACE. SO THE COMMITTEE -- THE LIQUOR LICENSE -- THE COMMITTEE RECOMMENDS APPROVAL. THANK YOU, AND MR. REIN IS ON THE LINE. IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS.
04:08:47.121: >> Clerk Beaudry: MAYOR, I SENT MR. REIN TO TURN DOWN HIS TV IF HE WANTED TO SPEAK.
04:08:53.361: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? MR. REIN LOOKS LIKE HE'S GETTING OFF SCOTT-FREE. ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. DC-7 BEING DELETED. DC-8, RESOLUTION TO ACCEPT THE FINAL REPORT OF THE CENTER OF THE CITY TASK FORCE. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER, AND SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI. DISCUSSION OF DC-8. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
04:09:24.058: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK US, MR. MAYOR. I APPRECIATE THIS COMING FORWARD AND THE ESSENCE IS THAT WE WILL ACCEPT IN THE REPORT. THERE WAS A LOT OF GOOD STUFF IN THE REPORT AND IT REALLY DID A FINE JOB OF LAYING OUT THE NEXT STEPS FOR US AS A COMMUNITY AND AS A COUNCIL AND I KNOW THAT SOME OF IT WAS -- AND SOME OF THE NOTION OF A COMMONS IS THAT IT'S A GATHERING PLACE AND IT'S DIFFICULT TO EMBRACE RIGHT NOW BUT IT WON'T BE LIKE THIS FOREVER AND SO THIS COMMONS SHOULD KEEP MOVING FORWARD. AND MOST OF WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE, THE NEXT STEPS ARE LAID OUT IN THIS AND THERE'S SIMPLE COUNCIL RESOLUTION STEP, FORMING THE COMMITTEE OF THE COMMONS AND, IN FACT OF THE SIX DIFFERENT SUGGESTIONS THAT ARE IN THERE, 1.14, 2.1, 4 AND 6 AND 26 ARE ALL THINGS THAT ARE AT NO COST TO THE CITY. AND SO WE DON'T HAVE A -- IT'S RESOLUTIONS. IT'S FORMING COMMITTEES, IT'S FORMING GROUPS AND IT'S ENJOINING THIS CONVERSATION AROUND THE NOTION OF A COMMONS AND I ENCOURAGE MY COLLEAGUES TO SUPPORT ACCEPTING THIS AND I THANK EVERYONE ON THE TASK FORCE AND IT'S SEYFARTH WHO MAY BE ON THE LINE WITH US. AND I THINK MOVING FORWARD, I THINK THE NEXT THING THAT WILL COME BACK IS A RESOLUTION TO FORM THIS COMMONS COMMITTEE. AND ALSO SOME INTERNAL COMMITTEES. AND SEND I THINK THE NEXT THING WE SHOULD DO IS ASK -- BRING A RESOLUTION FORWARD. I DIDN'T WANT TO AMEND THIS. I THINK WE SHOULD GET A RESOLUTION THAT IS LOOKING FORWARD TO '21, '22 BUDGET CYCLE WHERE WE HAVE STAFF PUT SOME NUMBERS ON THINGS THAT I'M HAPPY TO PULL OUT FROM THE SIX RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WILL HAVE COSTS WITH THEM. BUT AS IT TURNS OUT, MUCH OF THIS IS PLANNING AND DESIGN AND COMMUNICATE ORGANIZING AND THERE'S NO COST ASSOCIATED WITH THAT INITIALLY, OTHER THAN MAYBE THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME STAFF SUPPORT. AND I ENCOURAGE THE ADOPTION OF THIS AND I THANK EVERYBODY WHO SERVED ON THE TASK FORCE AND ALL THE -- ESPECIALLY ALL THE FOLKS FROM THE PUBLIC WHO GAVE THEIR INPUT OVER THE -- THE PERIOD OF THE TASK FORCE FORM NATION. IT WAS INVALUABLE AND I THINK ENLIGHTENING ALSO. THANK YOU.
04:12:09.523: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI. RAM >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, AND THANKS EVERYONE WHOSE WORK HAS GONE INTO THIS. IT'S A LENGTHY REPORT. I DO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH ONE PAGE OF THE REPORT, THE FINAL PAGE. REPORT. I WOULD LIKE IT TO BE REMOVED. I DON'T THINK IT'S -- I'M NOT SURE HOW YOU GO ABOUT THAT PARLIAMENT-WISE, BUT I'M NOT GOING TO ACCEPT IT WITH THAT LAST PAGE AS A PART OF THE REPORT.
04:12:48.495: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
04:12:51.732: >> Councilmember Lumm: I WILL DEFER TO COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI MADE A MOTION OF SORTS WHICH I WILL SUPPORT. THIS WAS BROUGHT UP AT THE CAUCUS LAST NIGHT AND HE EXPLAINED THE RATIONALE OTHERS WHO PARTICIPATED IN LAST NIGHT'S CONVERSATION OF BEING SUPPORTIVE. MR. POSTEMA, PERHAPS, IS -- WHAT -- FORMALIZED THE REMOVAL OF THE LAST PAGE, ANY RECOMMENDATIONS?
04:13:24.865: >> City Atty. Postema: I HAVEN'T LOOKED AT IT, I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND IT. IT'S A REPORT THAT'S BEEN DONE BY A -- BY A -- A COMMITTEE OR COMMISSION, AND IT'S PART OF THE RECORD AT THIS POINT. I WOULD HAVE TO THINK ABOUT FORMAL PROCESS OF REMOVING SOMETHING, BUT I THINK FOR THE MOST PART, IT'S PART OF THE RECORD. YOU CAN PERHAPS NOT ACCEPT THE LAST PAGE OR -- BUT IT'S GOING TO BE PART OF -- IT'S PART OF THE DOCUMENT THAT IS BEFORE YOU.
04:14:06.440: >> Councilmember Lumm: I THINK IT WAS NOT -- IT WAS NOT PROFESSIONAL, FRANKLY. IT WAS A PAGE WITH SOME POST-IN NOTES THAT WERE OVERLY PERSONAL MAYBE, AND A BIT OFFENSIVE TO SOME. I'M JUST -- IT -- I THINK -- I THINK THE SENSE IS DETRACTED FROM THE QUALITY OF THE REPORT. ASIDE FROM THAT, I JUST WANT TO THANK COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. ALSO WOULD LIKE TO THANK ALL THE FOLKS WHO ON THE CENTER OF THE CITY TASK FORCE, THEY WORK VERY HARD IN DEVELOPING THIS REPORT. AND THERE ARE MANY PARTICIPANTS AS OTHERS HAVE NOTED WHO WORKED VERY HARD AND CONTRIBUTED A LOT TO ITS CREATION. YEAH, SO MANY RESIDENTS PARTICIPATED IN THE INTERVIEWS AND THE OPEN HOUSES. THE SURVEYS THAT THE TASK FORCE CONDUCTED TO INFORM AND HELPED SHAPE THE REPORT. I'M CERTAINLY HAPPY TO RECEIVE THIS REPORT. I APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S EFFORTS IN MAKING IT HAPPEN. IT WILL BE, I BELIEVE, MOST CERTAINLY A VERY IMPORTANT DOCUMENT AS THE CITY MOVES FORWARD OUT  ON THE CENTER OF TE CITY. THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER FOR GIVING US THIS OPPORTUNITY TO FORMALLY ACKNOWLEDGE THE WORK AND EXTEND -- AND ACCEPT AND RECEIVE
04:15:39.500: >> Councilmember Eaton: MR. MAYO R, POINT OF ORDER.
04:15:43.303: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
04:15:43.804: >> Councilmember Eaton: I BELIEVE THERE WAS A MOTION AND A SECOND TO STRIKE THE LAST PAGE OF THE REPORT.
04:15:48.175: >> Mayor Taylor: THERE'S BEEN NEITHER. HE SAID -- IT WAS SAID THAT HE WASN'T -- COUNCILMEMBER INDICATED THAT HE WASN'T GOING TO ACCEPT IT WITH IT AND THAT WAS THAT. PEOPLE ARE FREE TO MAKE THAT EFFORT BUT NO ONE SAID I'M MOVING TO DO THIS OR ANYTHING TO THAT EFFECT. SO --
04:16:11.098: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I WILL -- I WAS ASKING WHAT THE PROPER PROCEDURE WOULD BE. I'M SORRY. I WASN'T CLEAR WITH THAT. HOW DO YOU -- HOW DO YOU ACCEPT A REPORT, EVERYTHING BUT THAT LAST PAGE? THAT'S WHAT I WAS ASKING?
04:16:26.847: >> Mayor Taylor: SURE. MR. POSTEMA --
04:16:31.985: >> City Atty. Postema: I THINK YOU COULD ACCEPT THE REPORT AND IF YOU DISAPPROVE OF THE LAST PAGE, DON'T ACCEPT THAT LAST PAGE. AND THAT WILL DO IT. I WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT THAT MORE CLOSELY AND THIS IS THE BEST GUIDANCE YOU CAN GET. I WOULD ACCEPT THE REPORT, EXCEPT THE PAGE -- I HAVE NOT SEEN IT, BUT I THINK, YOU KNOW, YOU WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THAT. THAT WOULD EXPRESS YOUR DISAPPROVAL.
04:16:59.513: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THROUGH AN AMENDMENT? WHAT TYPE OF -- HOW DO YOU DO THAT?
04:17:06.386: >> Mayor Taylor: PERHAPS -- I MEAN, NONE OF THIS IS PARTICULARLY URGENT AND IF IT GETS SQUIRRELY, MAYBE WE POSTPONE THIS TO OUR NEXT MEETING AND THEN WE CAN WORK THIS OUT? MOVED BY RAMLAWI AND SECONDED BY BANNISTER. IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION OF THE POSTPONEMENT? ON POSTPONEMENT, I HAVE GRAND AND THEN HAYNER.
04:17:39.887: >> Councilmember Grand: JUST --
04:17:40.554: >> Mayor Taylor: LOWERING SOME HANDS TO KEEP --
04:17:43.490: >> Councilmember Grand: GIVEN THAT OUR NEXT MEETING IS BUDGET, I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE PUT THIS OFF TO THE FIRST MEETING IN JUNE ON POSTPOP POSTPONEMENT IF THAT-
04:17:53.667: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THAT'S FINE WITH ME.
04:17:55.435: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THAT A FRIENDLY AMENDMENT TO EVERYBODY? FIRST MEETING IN -- FIRST MEETING IN JUNE POSTPONEMENT OF THE FIRST MEETING IN JUNE. I BELIEVE COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, YOU WERE IN THE QUEUE FOR POSTPONEMENT.
04:18:06.680: >> Councilmember Hayner: THERE'S NO REASON TO POSTPOPE PE THIS. I KNOW PERFECT S MR. SMITH COUL. THE TASK FORCE HAD A CHALLENGE TO REACH OUT TO PEOPLE AND SOLICIT THEIR IDEAS AND WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN WITH THE COMMON SPACE AND THERE WAS -- IT'S FAIR TO SAY THERE WAS AN ORGANIZED RESPONSE THAT INSISTED THAT THIS SPACE MUST HAVE AFFORDABLE HOUSING ON IT. AND SO WHEN WE PUT THESE APPENDICES AS IT WERE IN THIS REPORT, I BELIEVE THAT THAT IMAGE OF THAT BOARD WAS A COMPROMISE TO SHOW THAT THERE WERE IDEAS THAT WERE BROUGHT FORWARD AT THESE PUBLIC HEARINGS WHERE PEOPLE WERE VERY INSISTENT AND THEY WROTE IT DOWN THAT THIS IS WHAT THEY FELT THEY WANTED. AND SO I DON'T -- I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW IF I WANT -- IF MR. SMITH OR MS. SEYFARTH WANT TO SPEAK TO THAT. I FELT IT WAS SORT OF A COMPROMISE AND IT DIDN'T DO ANY HARM TO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE WAS A VERY VOCAL GROUP OF FOLKS WHO FELT THAT THIS SHOULD SERVE THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING COMMUNITY IN SOME WAY. AND I BELIEVE THAT IT WILL SERVE THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING COMMUNITY IN SOME WAY, ESPECIALLY AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THE Y LOT AND THE ADJACENT PROPERTIES AND SO ON. I DON'T REALLY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT LAST PAGE, ALTHOUGH I DO THINK IT'S A LITTLE ODD. I SEEM TO RECALL IT WAS THE RESULT OF A COMPROMISE TO RECOGNIZE THAT THIS WAS A PUBLIC QUEST FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING ON THIS SPACE. SO I -- I WON'T SUPPORT A POSTPONEMENT. I THINK -- I THINK WE CAN GET IT MOVING AND THEN THE FIRST MEETING IN JUNE, NOT NECESSARILY OUR NEXT MEETING, ALTHOUGH IT WOULD BE, BUT IT WILL BE VERY BUDGET CENTRIC. YOU KNOW, LIKE I SAY, I WILL BRING FORWARD A MOTION FOR THE COMMITTEE OF THE COMMONS. WE REALLY SHOULD HAVE HAD IT ON OUR MARCH 19th PET MEETING OR WHATEVER IT WAS WHEN THEY MADE THE PRESENTATION. THAT WAS ON ME. I DIDN'T HAVE SOMETHING READY FOR THAT. I DON'T SUPPORT POSTPONING IT. I DON'T SEE A PROBLEM WITH THIS LAST PAGE. I SEE A PROBLEM WITH IT, BUT IT'S NOT A --
04:20:18.745: >> Mayor Taylor: ACKERMAN, SMITH AND BANNISTER ON POSTPONEMENT.
04:20:22.716: >> Councilmember Ackerman: COUNCILMEMBER SMITH TRIED TO RAISE HIS HAND BEFORE ME. HE PROBABLY HAS MORE CONTEXT. I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM HIM FIRST.
04:20:32.893: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER SMITH.
04:20:35.028: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YOU ARE MUTED.
04:20:36.963: >> Mayor Taylor: YOU ARE MUTED.
04:20:39.566: >> Councilmember Smith: SORRY. I WILL ECHO WHAT COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER SAID IS THE TASK FORCE HAD A VERY CHALLENGING ASSIGNMENT AND I BELIEVE THAT THIS LAST PAGE IS A RECORD OF THE FACT THAT THERE IS -- THERE WERE A LOT OF PARTICIPANTS WHO FEEL VERY STRONGLY THAT THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN AFFORDABLE HOUSING ON THE SITE. I DON'T THINK IT'S OFFENSIVE TO INCLUDE IT. I'M NOT GOING TO SPORT PONEMENT. I THINK THIS IS MERELY A RECORD OF THE RANGE OF INPUT THAT THE TASK FORCE GOT. I REALIZE SOME PEOPLE MIGHT NOT LIKE SOME OF IT, BUT I THINK TO DISMISS PEOPLE'S INPUT, BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE IT OR DISAGREE WITH IT IS DANGEROUS.
04:21:25.979: >> City Atty. Postema: LET ME MAKE ONE POINT HERE. THE REPORT ITSELF IS PART OF THE AGENDA AND SO THAT IS PART OF THE RECORD NOW BEFORE THIS COUNCIL. AND SO, YOU  YOU KNOW IT'S NOT E PAGES GET RIPPED OUT OR WHATEVER. THAT'S NOT WHAT THE CLERK WOULD DO, BUT AS FAR AS ACCEPTING THE REPORT, I THINK YOU COULD HAVE A MOTION TO NOT ACCEPT A PAGE, BUT IT'S GOING TO BE IN THE -- I MEAN, IT'S GOING TO BE IN THE RECORD. SO I HOPE THAT MAYBE ASSISTS YOU.
04:22:03.416: >> Mayor Taylor: I HAVE GOT NOW BANNISTER -- I GUESS ACKERMAN AND BANNISTER, ACKERMAN HAVING PASSED BEFORE -- OR DEFERRED. WERE YOU STILL IN THE QUEUE? ZACK JUST QUICKLY. THANKS FOR THE CONTEXT, COUNCILMAN HAYNER AND SMITH.
04:22:27.073: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
04:22:27.974: >> Councilmember Bannister: I'M FINE WITH NOT POSTPONING IT ALSO. I WOULD LIKE TO FOLLOW UP ON WHAT COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER SAID ABOUT ESTABLISHING THE COMMONS. THAT WAS ORIGINALLY MY INTENTION WAS TO HAVE THAT IN THIS RESOLUTION. SO IF WE WANTED TO, WE COULD JUST AMENDMENT THIS TO ADD A RESOLVE IN HERE AT THE END THAT WE WOULD GO FORTH AND ESTABLISH THE COUNCIL OF THE COMMONS.
04:22:57.304: >> I HAVE A MOTION.
04:22:58.505: >> Mayor Taylor: LET ME SUGGEST THAT THAT'S A COMPLICATED QUESTION THAT SHOULD -- THAT -- NATURE OF THAT COMMITTEE AND THE COMMISSION WOULD PROBABLY BE SUBJECT TO MORE THOUGHT THAN JUST -- THAT JUST A RESOLVE CLAUSE IN THE BACK END AND PERHAPS THAT IS BETTER DONE IN CONSULTATION WITH STAFF, AND WHAT THE NATURE OF THAT BODY WOULD BE.
04:23:23.830: >> Councilmember Bannister: ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?
04:23:27.234: >> Mayor Taylor: THAT'S JUST MY SUGGESTION. IF YOU DON'T CONCUR, THEN THAT'S YOUR CALL.
04:23:33.773: >> Councilmember Bannister: WELL, I THINK THE REPORT WAS -- IT'S FA FAIRLY STRAIGHTFORWARD T WOULD BE POPULATED BY TASK FORCE MEMBERS AND OTHERS AND THEY WOULD BEGIN DISCUSSIONS OF FURTHER -- FURTHER DISCUSSION OF WHAT IS HAPPENING ON THE CENTER OF THE CITY. I THINK IT'S A LITTLE DISAPPOINTING AND STUFF THAT WE -- THAT WE TAKE TOO LONG ON THESE THINGS AND PEOPLE ARE ANXIOUS TO GET STARTED.
04:24:04.170: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER EATON?
04:24:06.907: >> Councilmember Eaton: THANK YOU. I'M GOING TO OPPOSE THE I DEFINITELY THINK THAT WE SHOULD AMEND THIS TO CREATE A COMMITTEE JUST ON THE FLY. I HAVE THINK THAT SHOULD COME BACK AS A SEPARATE RESOLUTION. THAT NEEDS TO HAVE THE DETAILS CONSIDERED AT LENGTH. I HOPE THAT WE CAN MOVE FORWARD ON THIS.
04:24:32.565: >> Mayor Taylor: I WILL SUPPORT THE POSTPONEMENT FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO ENGAGE THIS. I BELIEVE THE PAGE REMAIN AS PART OF THE REPORT AND I BELIEVE WE ACCEPT THAT BECAUSE THAT'S THE NATURE OF WHAT OUR RESIDENTS GAVE US. FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE POSTPONEMENT. ROLL CALL VOTE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
04:24:54.254: >> Councilmember Nelson:  THIS IS ON POSTPONEMENT?
04:24:56.756: >> Mayor Taylor: IT IS ON POSTPONEMENT. SORRY THANK YOU.
04:24:58.725: >> Councilmember Nelson:  NO.
04:25:04.297: >> Councilmember Smith: NO.
04:25:04.898: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES.
04:25:08.101: >> Councilmember Hayner:  NO.
04:25:10.337: >> Councilmember Bannister: NO.
04:25:12.739: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES.
04:25:17.210: >> Councilmember Lumm: NO.
04:25:21.648: >> Councilmember Grand: NO.
04:25:22.248: >> Councilmember Ackerman: NO.
04:25:28.688: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
04:25:29.622: >> Councilmember Eaton: NO.
04:25:30.323: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION FAILS.
04:25:31.524: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN MOTION. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
04:25:40.900: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANKS. I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT THE NOTION OF THIS GREAT SETTING UP, THE COMMONS -- THE COUNCIL IS PRETTY MILLION DESCRIBED IN THIS DOCUMENT AND I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO WATCH THIS AS A SEPARATE RESOLUTION. COUNCILMAN NELSON, AND I WAS GOING TO PREPARE ONE PRIOR TO THIS AND SLAP IT ON THIS. IT IS THE DISCUSSION AND WE COULD EASILY DO THAT WITH A SEPARATE RESOLUTION AND I'M HAPPY TO WORK WITH ANYONE ON COUNCIL TO BRING THAT FORWARD AT THE NEXT AVAILABLE TIME AND I DO AGREE PEOPLE ARE -- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE STAY AT HOME ORDERS AND SO FORTH, THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE EXCITEMENT. THEY ENDED UP BEING VIRTUAL EARTH DAY AND THAT WAS A DISPOINT TO FOLKS. THERE IS AN URGE TO CREATE A COMMONS -- A SPACE FOR ALL IN THIS CITY AND WE ARE TRYING TO ANSWER THAT. AND THE NEXT STEP IS LAID OUT. IT'S ITEMS 1-3 THROUGH 1.4 AND THAT WILL BE LAID OUT IN THE RESOLUTION WE BRING FORWARD.
04:26:54.574: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. CRAWFORD.
04:26:55.208: >> City Admin. Crawford: THANK YOU, MAYOR. I RECOGNIZE THE MOMENTUM AND THE INTEREST IN MOVING THIS FORWARD. I DO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT SOME OF THE ITEMS THAT WHEN YOU HAVE A COMMITTEE TO BETTER MEET -- THAT TYPICALLY DOES DRIVE WORK FOR STAFF, AND, YOU KNOW, ATHE THIS TIME -- I WOULD ASK THAT YOU REMEMBER THAT THINGS MAY MOVE A LITTLE LOWER WITH STAFF THAN THEY DO NORMALLY, BECAUSE OF THE WAY WE ARE OPERATING AND WE MAY BE OPERATING FOR QUITE SOMETIME. SO IN ADDITION TO THAT, HAD EVEN STAFF SUPPORT REQUIRES PROBABLY SOME -- SOME UPWARD BUDGET ADJUSTMENT IF WE ARE TO DO THE PRELIMINARY DESIGN KIND OF WORK. SO MEMBERS WHO ARE INTERESTED IN THAT MAY WANT TO CONTACT ME ABOUT WHAT THAT MIGHT LOOK LIKE FOR BUDGE ELIMINATE AMENDMENT TO APPROPRIATE ADDITIONAL FUNDING IN SOME WAY. IT MIGHT NOT BE A LOT, BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO BE HONEST THAT THE STAFF WORK STILL COSTS AND WE HAVE TO ADJUST FOR THAT.
04:28:01.074: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
04:28:05.345: >> Councilmember Nelson:  YES.

04:28:49.956: >> Clerk Beaudry: MAYOR TAYLOR. IF I MAY, THIS ISN'T NOTED ON THE AGENDA, BUT LATE THIS AFTERNOON, ANOTHER PROTEST PUTS THIS AT AN EIGHT VOTE REQUIREMENT.
04:29:02.068: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FURTHER DISCUSSION OF DS-1? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
04:29:10.777: >> Councilmember Hayner: YEAH, THANKS, MR. MAYOR. SO THE TROUBLE WITH THIS SIDEWALK AND OTHER SIDEWALK PROJECTS THAT ARE COMING BEFORE US HERE IS NOT THAT THERE IS NOT A NEED FOR SIDEWALKS IN MANY OF THESE PLACES THAT THESE ARE CRITICAL GAPS THAT ARE BEING FILLED, SOMETIMES CONCURRENTLY WITH CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS AND SOMETIMES AFTER THE FACT, AS THE NEXT COUPLE ARE. THE PROBLEM IS THE ASKING THE RESIDENTS TO PAY FOR THIS, ESPECIALLY IN THESE UNCERTAIN TIMES. AND I HAVE MENTIONED THAT MANY TIMES IN THE PAST. I RECOGNIZE THAT. AND IT'S -- IT'S ABOUT FINDING A WAY. IT'S ABOUT US TRYING TO FIND A WAY TO SUPPORT THE SIDEWALKS AND THE NEED FOR THESE SIDEWALKS WITH A WAY TO PAY FOR THEM THAT IS NOT LAYING INTO THESE NEIGHBORS ANYMORE. AND ONCE AGAIN, I'M SORT OF INFORMALLY ASKING STAFF TO TRY AND FIND A WAY TO PAY FOR THESE, ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY ARE CONCURRENT, WHERE THEY ARE NOT LEANING ON THE NEIGHBORS BEING ESPECIALLY NOWADAYS. WITH THINK WE CAN AGREE THAT SIDEWALKS ARE A PUBLIC GOOD. TYPICALLY WHEN YOU HAVE A PUBLIC GOOD, YOU HAVE A PUBLIC PAY. AND WE HAVE A PUBLIC GOOD WITH PRIVATE PAY HERE. AND THERE ARE SOURCES OF FUNDING AVAILABLE TO US. WE HAVE SIDEWALK MILLAGE FUND AND WE HAVE ALTERNATIVE TRANSPORTATION FUND THIS MEETS THE VISION ZERO GOALS AND MEETS THE CLIMATE ACTION GOALS AND SO I BELIEVE THAT WE COULD SHOP AROUND AND FIND A WAY TO PAY FOR THESE AND PUT THESE SIDEWALKS? PLACE WITHOUT LAYING THEM ON THESE ADJACENT NEIGHBORS. I THINK IT'S TIME THAT WE -- WE RETHINK OUR MODEL FOR HOW WE ARE PAYING FOR SIDEWALKS. I THINK IT'S TIME THAT WE RECOGNIZE THE COMMUNITY AND THE COMMON GOOD THAT SIDEWALKS ARE AND PAY FOR THEM ACCORDINGLY. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT SOME NEIGHBORHOODS THAT ARE NEVER GOING TO HAVE SIDEWALKS THAT ARE NEVER ASKED TO PAY FOR THE COMMON GOOD, WE KNOW THERE'S NEIGHBORHOODS IN SOME WARDS THAT ARE SIDEWALK LIST -- THERE'S NEIGHBORHOODS A BLOCK AWAY FROM THIS, THAT ARE SIDEWALKLESS. AND THEY MAY OR MAY NOT BE ASKED TO PAY FOR THIS -- THEY ARE DEFINITELY NOT ASKED TO PAY FOR THIS COMMON GOOD, THAT THEY WILL BE USING. AND SO I'M JUST -- I'M DOWN ON THIS NOTION THAT WE CONTINUE TO ASSESS THE ADJACENT PROPERTY OWNERS AND FOR THAT REASON I'M NOT GOING TO SUPPORT IT. I WOULD HAPPILY SUPPORT IT IF STAFF CAME BACK AND SAID HERE'S AN ALTERNATIVE SOURCE OF FUNDING.
04:31:44.664: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
04:31:45.565: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES. I WANT TO JUST ECHO WHAT COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER WAS SAYING. THERE'S FOUR SIDEWALK PLANS ON TONIGHT'S AGENDA. TWO ARE GREAT AND SUPPORTED AND TWO ARE FRAUGHT WITH TROUBLE AND HAVE THE EIGHT VOTE REQUIREMENT AND THE OBJECTION OF THE OWNERS OF THE PROPERTY. AND I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT, LIKE, IF THE CITY PAID FOR ALL OF THE SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS FOR THIS BARTON DRIVE SIDEWALK, IT WOULD -- FOR ONLY $46,549. SO ON THE CITY BUDGET, IT'S VERY TEENY, BUT WHEN YOU TRANSLATE THAT INTO WHAT THE HOMEOWNER WILL PAY, THE SMALLEST BILL FOR ONE OF THE HOMEOWNERS IS $3,687; WHEREAS, THE ESTIMATE FOR THE OTHER END IS WHITTLED DOWN TO A BIG $13,826. AND THAT STILL COULD CHANGE BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW YET WHAT THE DESIGN PLANS ARE OR THE IMPACTS ARE ON THEIR YARD. THERE'S BEEN TALK WE DON'T HAVE TO GIVE UP A DRIVEWAY AND WE WON'T BE ABLE TO ENTER OR EXIT ON BARTION DRIVE ANYMORE, BUT FRIDAY NIGHT WE RECEIVED A 61 PAGE ENGINEERING DOCUMENT THAT STILL DOES NOT TELL US WITH TRANSPARENCY AND ACCESSIBILITY WHAT THE DESIGN EVEN IS YET OR THE FINAL COST. I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT TO COUNCIL, A COUPLE OF THINGS FROM THE AGENDA QUESTION, WE DO HAVE A DECEMBER 17 OF 2019 MEMO THAT EXPLAINS DIFFERENT SIDEWALK STRATEGIES. DIFFERENT PLACES TO GET THE MONEY. AND SO WE SHOULD -- I WOULD -- I WOULD RECOMMEND IF WE WANT TO EVEN PROCEED WITH THE SIDEWALK, I MEAN I WOULD BE COMFORTABLE TO VOTE NO ON THIS SIDEWALK TODAY, BUT IF WE WANT -- IF THERE'S STRONG REASON TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON IT, IN THE AGENDA QUESTIONS, STAFF DID INDICATE IT WOULD NOT HARM THE PROJECT IF WE WAITED UNTIL THE FIRST MEETING IN JUNE. SO WE COULD STUDY THE SIDEWALK STRATEGIES MEMO IN GREATER DETAIL AND TRY AND REACH A CONSENSUS ON DIFFERENT WAYS TO COVER THIS 46,000. AND I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THEY DO THIS BECAUSE WITH THE 150 OTHER MILES OF SIDEWALK GAPS, AND ALL THIS CONVERSATION WE HAVE HAVING TONIGHT ABOUT EQUITY AND SUFFERING AND THE SPIRIT OF HELPING AND CHALLENGING TIMES AND THE RECESSION JUST BEGINNING, THAT WE SHOULD TREAT THESE HOW WE WOULD LIKE TO BE TROATTREATED AND AS WE LOOK AT E OTHER SIDEWALK GAPS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE STOP DOING IT THIS WAY. JUST BECAUSE WE HAVE DONE IT THIS WAY IN THE PAST, OF MAKING THE HOMEOWNERS PAY FOR IT, OR PART OF IT, THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT RIGHT GOING FORWARD. AND SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS WITH THIS PROJECT. THANK YOU.
04:35:17.276: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
04:35:18.978: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANKS, MR. MAYOR. I WAS PLANNING ON JUST MAKING ONE SET OF COMMENTS FOR ALL FOUR BECAUSE WE HAVE FOUR SIDEWALK GAPS BEFORE US. AND I BELIEVE THERE IS A SPECIAL ASSESSMENT ITEMS TONIGHT, TWO FOR BARTON, ONE FOR NIXON TRAVER AND ONE FOR FULLER. WE HAVE RECEIVED FORMAL OBJEOBJECTIONS RELATED TO THE NN TRAVER AND AGREED TO THE PONTIAC BARTON PROJECT. FOR ALL OF THESE SIDEWALK -- YOU HAVE SPECIAL ASSESSMENT PROJECTS. THEY REPRESENT A HARDSHIP FOR MANY FOLKS. THEY DO TRY TO MITIGATE BY SPREADING THE COST OVER INSTALLMENT BUT THE COSTS DO REMAIN SIGNIFICANT. NO ONE WANTS TO PAY THE ASSESSMENTS AND THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE AND I'M CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO BE CRITICAL OF FOLKS OBJECTING AND I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO NOTE THAT EVERYONE -- EVERYONE PAYS THE SIDEWALK MILLAGE AND THAT INCLUDES PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE SIDEWALKS. SO -- BECAUSE I THINK IT WAS IMPLIED THAT THESE COSTS ARE NOT SPREAD ACROSS ALL RESIDENTS AND THEY ARE. BUT THE ASSESSMENT OR THE NEW SIDEWALKS HAS ALWAYS BEEN HANDLED THIS WAY. IT'S BA BASED ON THE PROPERTY FRONTAGE. AND TO BE HONEST, YES, THERE ARE MEMOS ISSUED ON THIS TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS OVER TIME, BUT IT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME WHAT THE ALTERNATIVE IS. WE HAVE SAID AS A COUNCIL FOR -- THIS IS A PRIORITY FEELING SIDEWALK, HIGH PRIORITY SIDEWALK GAPS AND THE PROCESS THAT WE ARE UTILIZING AND DETERMINING ASSESSMENTS IS THE SAME ONE THE CITY HAS USED FOR HONESTLY DECADES, I WOULD SAY. IT'S BEEN A LONG, LONG TIME. I DON'T KNOW OF ANY OTHER PROCESS AND APPROACH THAT WE HAVE EVER UTILIZED. SO REALISTICALLY, UNLESS WE WANT TO ABANDON FEELING SIDEWALK GAPS AND HIGH PRIORITY AREAS OR UNTIL WE HAVE A DIFFERENT FUNDING MECHANISM, LIKELY A NEW MILLAGE, -- LET'S BE HONEST -- THIS IS HOW IT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND HAS BEEN DONE. I THINK IT'S ALSO VERY IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT THE CITY DOES NOT BRING THESE FORWARD UNLESS THEY HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS PRIORITY GAPS TO FILL. THE NIXON TRAVER SIDEWALK, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT ONE IS IN THE FIRST WARD BUT IT -- YOU KNOW, IT IS RIGHT ON THE FIRST-SECOND WARD BOUNDARY ON NIXON ROAD AND TODAY WE HAVE HEARD FROM A COUPLE OF FOLKS IN THE SECOND WARD. NEIGHBORS WHO SEE THE HIGH VALUE OF -- OF HAVING THESE GAPS FILLED AND IT IS A KEY ACCESS TO LOGAN ELEMENTARY AND I WILL JUST ALSO NOPE THAT -- THAT -- THAT THE GAPS ON THIS STRETCH OF NIXON -- THE FEW GAPS, AGAIN -- THE NIXON TRAVER GAPS. THEY ARE ENVISIONED TO BE COMPLETED ALSO AS PART OF THE -- THAT'S COUNSEL THE ROAD. THAT'S A WHOLE OTHER CONVERSATION. THE NIXON CORRIDOR IMPROVE PROJECT. AND NOW THERE'S GRANT FUNDING THAT WE HAVE TO -- TO -- THAT IS IMPORTANT LEVERAGE TO REDUCE THESE COSTS FOR THE PROPERTY OWNERS AND IF THIS WERE POSTPONED, I'M TALKING ABOUT THE NIXON TRAVER FULLER WALKS THAT WOULD PUT GRANT FUNDING AT RISK, WHICH OBVIOUSLY WOULD NOT BE POSITIVE. SO JUST IN GENERAL, I DON'T TAKE -- I KNOW NONE OF US DO, TO ASSESS RESIDENTS THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS BUT THIS IS THE SAME APPROACH AND THE COST ALLOCATION THAT THE CITY HAS USED FOREVER. I DO BELIEVE THESE -- THAT THESE ARE PRIORITY GAPS TO FILL. AND SO I WILL BE VOTING IN FAVOR OF ALL FOUR OF THESE AGENDA ITEMS WHICH IS DS-1 THROUGH DS-4 TONIGHT. THANK YOU.
04:39:41.207: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
04:39:47.046: >> Councilmember Hayner: YEAH, I WAS JUST -- MY QUESTION WAS RELATED TO THE PROCESS HERE. I MEAN, I'M -- I'M CONVINCED THAT IT'S THE WRONG THING TO DO TO LAY THIS CHARGE ON THESE PEOPLE AND YET MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IF -- I GUESS WE WANT TO CLEAR UP THIS UNDERSTANDING IF WE DON'T -- IF THIS GETS VOTED DOWN BECAUSE IT REQUIRES SO MANY VOTES, THEN WE'RE GOING TO DO ALL OF THIS WORK AND NOT PUT IN SIDEWALKS WHICH IS HARD TO BELIEVE. AND SO IT -- IT -- BECAUSE THIS IS THE FOURTH STAGE OF A PROCESS, RELATED TO CHAPTER 12, I DON'T THINK IT'S IN MY ABILITY OR AUTHORITY TO SIMPLY AMEND THIS RESOLUTION TO MAKE THE CITY PAY FOR IT INSTEAD. AND SO I NEED SOME -- I INTO ED SOME LEGAL ADVICE ON THIS NOTION. HOW WOULD IT BE THAT WE WOULD MAKE THIS SO THAT THE CITY PAID FOR IT, SINCE WE ARE NOT -- WE ARE NOT GETTING ANY NEW ANSWERS FROM STAFF. I MEAN, COULD I JUST -- WE GOT SIX RESOLVE CLAUSES THAT REFER BACK TO THE PROCESSES AND I CAN'T GET RID OF THOSE BECAUSE WE'RE SO FAR DOWN THE PROCESS. I FEEL LIKE WE ARE IN A YES OR NO SITUATION AND I'M NOT GOING TO YOU KNOW, ASSESS A BUNCH OF PEOPLE WHO ARE UNEMPLOYED AND COULD BE FOR YEARS FOR ALL WE KNOW. SO I JUST -- I WOULD -- I WOULD LIKE TO COME UP WITH A BETTER WAY. I WOULD LIKE TO UP WITH A BETTER WAY TO HANDLE THESES AND I CAN'T DO THAT WITHOUT STAFF'S HELP.
04:41:37.456: >> City Admin. Crawford: MAYOR, MAY I MAKE A COMMENT?
04:41:40.759: >> Mayor Taylor: PLEASE.
04:41:41.293: >> City Admin. Crawford: I HEAR THE FRUSTRATION THAT STAFF IS BRINGING THIS BACK WITH SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS, BUT I BELIEVE THIS IS WHAT IS -- STAFF IS FOLLOWING WHAT IS IN CODE, I BELIEVE IS CHAPTER 12, ON WHAT YOUR CODE SAYS ON HOW SIDEWALK GAPS SHOULD BE FILLED AND ASSESS SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS. THE MEMORY REFERS TO OUTLINES AND IDEAS WHERE OTHER SOURCES OF REVENUE COULD BE UTILIZED BUT LET ME POINT OUT THAT THOSE REVENUE SOURCES HAVE BEEN DONE IN THEIR RESPECTIVE FUNDS OR THE REVENUES HAVEN'T BEEN OBTAINED IN IT'S AN INCOME TAX, FOR EXAMPLE OR A BOND. SO THE -- FOR STAFF TO COME BACK, AND -- I MEAN, I THINK COUNCIL, I THINK FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, THE COUNCIL WANTS TO CHANGE THE ORDINANCE, WE SHOULD HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT THE CHANGING THE ORDINANCES IF CTA OF WANTS TO -- IF COUNCIL WANTS TO PAY FOR THIS ONE, THEN STAFF WOULD FIND THE OFFSET FOR THAT, BECAUSE THE MONEY HAS BEEN PROGRAMMED AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO HAVE STAFF SELECTING WHERE THAT WOULD COME FROM OURSELVES. THAT'S JUST OPENING UP A WHOLE OTHER BALL OF WAX BECAUSE IT'S ALREADY BEEN APPROVED BY COUNCIL WHERE THIS MONEY SHOULD BE SPENT. I WOULD BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH ANYBODY INTERESTED IN LOOKING AT THE ORDINANCE IN THAT'S YOUR DESIRE.
04:43:18.390: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER SMITH?
04:43:20.859: >> Councilmember Smith: SO I DO THINK MR. CRAWFORD HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD, IS THAT, YOU KNOW, WE NEED TO LOOK AT THAT ORDINANCE THAT AS THE CHANGE. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT FOR A WHILE AND I JUST WANT TO THROW SOME -- SOME NUMBERS OUT THERE, SO EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS KIND OF THE MAGNITUDE OF THE SIDEWALK GAPS THAT WE'RE FACING. IS, YOU KNOW, IF YOU LOOK AT THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SIDEWALK GAPS WE HAVE IN THE CITY, YOU KNOW, THAT'S ABOUT 145 MILES. BUT IF YOU GO THROUGH A PROCESS OF ANALYSIS AND TAKE OUT, YOU KNOW, GRAVEL ROADS THAT WON'T HAVE SIDEWALKS UNLESS THEY GET PAVED AND OTHER PLACES WHERE THERE AREN'T SIDEWALKS IT GETS DOWN TO ABOUT 90 MILES WORTH OF SIDEWALK GAPS THAT WE HAVE GOT. IN TODAY AH'S DOLLARS, ESTIMATES THAT COST BETWEEN 130 AND 195 MILLION TO BUILD THOSE SIDEWALKS. I THINK IT'S PERFECTLY REASONABLE TO EXPECT THE CITY TO DO THAT. BUT I THINK THE MECHANISM WE ARE LOOKING AT PROBABLY HAS TO DO WITH, YOU KNOW, THE RENEWAL AND THE EXPANSION OF THE LOCAL ROADS AND SIDEWALK MILLAGE TO ALLOW FOR THAT TO BE USED TO FILL SIDEWALK GAPS. I MEAN, WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT A LOW RANGE OF $94 MILLION, THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY, YOU KNOW, AND HOW ARE YOU GOING TO RAISE THAT? AND HOW ARE YOU GOING TO IMPLEMENT THAT OVER A REASONABLE TIME FRAME? SO, YOU KNOW, I'M ALL FOR LOOKING AT HOW WE FUND SIDEWALK CONSTRUCTION IN THE CITY. I THINK UNFORTUNATELY, WE ARE A LITTLE BIT BEHIND ON THAT -- ON THESE THIS EVENING. I WILL SUPPORT ALL FOUR OF THEM, BUT, YOU KNOW, CERTAINLY I'M SUBMITTED TO WORKING TOWARDS FINDING A SOLUTION TO HAVE THE CITY HAVE DIFFERENT SOURCE OF FUNDING RATHER THAN RELYING ON THE PROPERTY OWNER. THANKS.
04:45:29.254: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
04:45:30.122: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. IT'S ALWAYS AN INTERESTING CONVERSATION WITH THESE SIDEWALK GAPS COME UP, AND IT'S SOMEWHAT CIRCULAR IN DISCUSSIONS. AND, YOU KNOW, WE DID HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY FUND THIS ONE DIFFERENTLY. I JUST LOOKED UP OUR APRIL 6th E MINUTES, CA-22, WE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE $100,000 FROM THE PILOT PROGRAM THAT WAS ESTABLISHED THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE FOR RESIDENT-DRIVEN PROJECTS. AND, IN FACT, COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER VOTED NO ON THIS ONE IT WAS AN EIGHT VOTE REQUIREMENT. AND IT FELL ONE VOTE SHORT. SO I THINK STAFF HAS BEEN TRYING TO BE CREATIVE AS AS WE GO BACK AND FORTH ON THIS. THEY CAME TO DO THAT. I KNOW THAT WAS NOT IN THE SPIRIT OF COUNCILMEMBER NELSON'S RESOLUTION, BUT WE DID HAVE MONEY SITTING OVER FROM LAST YEAR, BECAUSE IT WAS UNSPENT. AND YET IT WAS DENIED. SO FOLKS, I -- WE CAN'T -- WE GOT TO LEAD AND WE GOT TO MAKE DECISIONS OURSELVES AND WE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO OFFSET THE COSTS ON BARTON. SEVEN VOTED YES, AND FOUR VOTED NO. I'M SORRY. I'M A LITTLE FRUSTRATED WITH THIS ONE BECAUSE THERE WAS AN ALTERNATIVE FUNDING SOURCE THAT WAS GIVEN TO US ON APRIL 6th, BUT IT WAS VOTED DOWN. ALSO IN THIS AREA, IT'S VERY DRIVEN IF ANYONE HAS BIKED OR DRIVEN OR WALKED, IT'S EXTREMELY DANGEROUS OVER THERE. WE HAVE VOTED NOT TO INSTALL BIKE LANES OVER THERE. IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT NO NEW SOLUTIONS HAVE BEEN PUT IN PLACE. WE WILL HAVE TO TIP IT FOLLOW THE POLICY AND THE ORDINANCES THAT WE HAVE UNTIL WE COLLECTIVELY COME UP WITH A DIFFERENT IDEA.
04:48:02.974: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, YOU ARE ON MUTE.
04:48:08.847: >> Councilmember Lumm: JUST IN TERMS OF HOW TO PAY FOR NEW SIDEWALKS, I HAVE TO BE HONEST WITH FOLKS. THE SIDEWALK MILLAGE WHICH IS NOW PART OF THE STREET AND BRIDGE MILLAGE AND ANYONE JUMP ON HERE AND CORRECT ME. ACTUALLY DID NOT SUPPORT THIS WAS YEARS AGO WHEN THE STREET AND BRIDGE WAS COMBINED WITH THE SIDEWALK MILLAGE. SKIED AVERAGE OF QUESTIONS AT THE TIME AND WE FOUND OUT THAT WHEN FOLKS PASSED THE STREET MILLAGE. IT WAS FOR TREATED. SIMILARLY, SIDEWALKS WERE SIDEWALK REPAIRS. THIS IS NOT FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION. WHAT I LEARNED. WITH ERR SPE -- WHAT I LEARNED,E ARE SPENDING LESS OF THE STREET MILLAGE ON STREETS. BUT IT WAS ONE BIG POT OF MONEY. SO THINGS WERE MORE FLUID. AND I HAD DIFFICULT WITH THAT, BECAUSE VOTERS SAID WE WANT TO SPEND -- WE ARE APPROVING SPENDING X ON STREET REPAIRS. AND, IN FACT, WE WEREN'T. AGAIN, WE PULLED THESE MILLAGES AND COMBINED THEM, I SHOULD SAY. AND WE WERE DOING BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE ADEQUATE FUNDING FOR THE REPAIRS. THIS GOES BACK A FEW TIMES FOR SIDEWALK REPAIRS. AS WE ADD SIDEWALKS, IT WILL TAKE MORE MONEY TO DO THAT REPAIR WORK. SOMEONE MENTIONED THAT GRAVEL STREETS, FOR EXAMPLE, MIGHT NOT NECESSARILY REQUIRE SIDEWALKS. WE HAD A COUPLE OF THOSE IN THE SECOND WARD AND NEIGHBORS DID STAFF -- STAFF OVER THE YEARS MET WITH NEIGHBORS ON THESE STREETS. THESE WERE FOLKS WHO EXPRESSED INTEREST IN HAVING THEIR STREET RESURFACED. THERE WAS NO INEXPENSIVE OPTION AND THE STREETS REMAIN UNSURFACED FOR THAT REASON. WHEN THE QUESTION WAS POSED, CAN WE ELIMINATE CURB AND GUTTER AND SIDEWALKS IT ALWAYS CAME BACK FROM STAFF, NO. THEY WANT ALL THE -- YOU KNOW, THE NICE TO HAVE THINGS. I GET IT. SO THEN THE COSTS INCREASE BECAUSE YOU ARE DOING THIS BASED ON FRONTAGE TO ADD THESE SIDEWALKS. SO EVEN IN THOSE AREAS WHERE SIDEWALKS DON'T GIFT ON GRAVEL ROADS, I KNOW STAPH RECOMMENDED BUILDING SIDEWALKS AND ASSESSING THE PROPERTY OWNERS. WE HAD SO MANY OF THESE PROJECTED. I MEAN, I BET THE FOLKS ACROSS THE STREET FOR THAT CLAGUE THAT WALKS TO SCHOOL ON THE EAST SIDE, THE SECOND WARD SIDE OF NIXON ROAD, THERE ARE PROBABLY FOLKS WHO ARE STILL MAKING INSTALLMENT PAYMENTS BASED ON THE FRONTAGE. I KNOW WE HAVE FOLKS AROUND THE CORNER ON GREEN ROAD. THERE IS AN EQUITY ISSUE. WE HAVE PEOPLE ACROSS THE CITY MAKING THEIR ANNUAL INSTALLMENTS ON A SIDEWALK THAT WAS BUILT ON THEIR PROPERTY. I THINK FAIRNESS AND HE CAN WITH IT IS IMPORTANT. SO WE CAN'T OVERLOOK THAT. THANKS.
04:51:43.461: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER, AND THEN PERHAPS WE GET TO VOTING ON THIS ONE.
04:51:46.131: >> Councilmember Bannister: OKAY. WELL, I JUST HAVE A DIFFERENT DEFINITION OF FAIRNESS AND EQUITY ON THERE, THAT IF WE -- JUST BECAUSE WE HAVE DONE IT WRONG IN THE PAST, IT DOESN'T MAKE IT WRONG TO KEEP ON DOING IT. AGAIN, IT'S ONLY 46,549, SO MAYBE THAT'S A QUESTION I HAVE FOR STAFF WOULD -- COULD THEY FIND -- IF WE JUST ANDED A ADDEA RESOLVE CLAUSE THAT THE CITY WOULD PAY THE $46,000, WOULD STAFF BE ABLE TO PAY?
04:52:28.807: >> City Admin. Crawford: STAFF WOULD WANT ASSISTANT IN FINDING THE MONEY. SO WE WOULD HAVE TO WORK WITH YOU TO FIND WHAT YOU FIND ACCEPTABLE TO NOT DO.
04:52:43.254: >> Councilmember Bannister: OKAY. WELL, THROUGH THE LENS OF PEOPLE'S PERSONAL FINANCES THAT WE DON'T WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE 40 US HOLD. IF THEY ARE OUT OF WORK OR WITHOUT HEALTH INSURANCE, WE DON'T KNOW. SO THROUGH THE LENS OF PERSONAL FINANCE AND -- AND CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE AFTERMATH AND THE FALL OUT FROM THE PANDEMIC, I'M JUST REALLY FEELING THAT WE -- WE -- WE NEED TO FOCUS LIKE THE CITY IS FOCUSING ON OUR NEEDS AND OUR WANTS, FOR THE INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNER THAT IT'S JUST WRONG TO TELL THEM THAT THEY HAVE GOT TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO PAY FOR IT. I'M NOT SAYING NEVER. THERE'S INNOVATIONS COMING DOWN IN THE AGENDA RESPONSE QUESTIONS. THERE'S INNOVATIONS IN MATERIALS AND DESIGN AND MULTIMODAL PADS FOR BIKES AND SUCH. SO I THINK THE NEIGHBORS, IF YOU READ THEIR OBJECTION LETTERS, THEY ARE NOT SAYING NEVER. THEY WOULD SAY THEY WOULD LOOK TO NEW TECHNIQUES AND NEW MATERIALS, BUT IF WE WANT THESE SIDEWALKS, THAT WE SHOULD KNOW WHAT OF THEIR NATURAL FEATURES -- MAYBE THAT'S A QUESTION TO ARE STAFF THAT TO THIS DAY, THE DESIGN PLAN AND THE YARDS AND NATURAL FEATURES ARE NOT KNOWN. SO WE ARE VOTING FOR AN UNKNOWN PLAN. WE HEARD SWITCH BACKS. WE HEARD LOSING A DRIVE WAY. WE HEARD A LITTLE BIT, BUT WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT ACTUALLY IS PLANNED FOR THIS DOLLAR BILL. IS THAT CORRECT? MAY THAT'S A QUESTION FOR MANY HUPY OR MR. HUTCHINSON. AM I CORRECT THAT THE PLANS ARE NOT CLEAR ON THE IMPACT ON THEIR PROPERTIES YET?
04:54:55.353: >> I CAN JUMP IN ON THAT. I THINK THE PLANS ARE PRETTY WELL FORMED AS FAR AS WHAT THE IMPACT ON THE NATURAL FEATURES. I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY MYSTERIES. THE ONLY PLACE THAT WAS NOT QUITE DETERMINED WAS THAT I THINK IT WAS 415 AT THE HAMPTONS THERE, WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO WORK WITH THEM ON DETERMINING WHAT THE BEST COURSE OF ACTION TO DO THAT SIDEWALK WAS, BUT THERE'S NOT REALLY ANY UNKNOWNED ON WHAT THE IMPACT TO NATURAL FEATURES WOULD BE.
04:55:24.849: >> Councilmember Bannister: SO 52. 527 HAS A BUNCH OF TREES IN FRONT AND WE SHOULD ASSUME THAT ALL OF THOSE WILL BE REMOVED?
04:55:38.396: >> I WOULD HAVE TO ASK OUR PROJECT MANAGER JANE ALLEN ABOUT THAT SPECIFICALLY. I BELIEVE THAT'S -- THOSE ARE DISCUSSED WITH PROPERTY OWNERS.
04:55:48.606: >> Councilmember Bannister: OKAY. I TRIED TO KEEP UP WITH THE PROJECT AND I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY COMMUNICATION ABOUT PROPERTIES OR THE IMPACT ON THE NATURAL FEATURES AND THE RAIN GARDENS.
04:56:05.957: >> I'M JANE ALLEN. I'M THE PROJECT MANAGER FOR THE GOD. AS NICK MENTIONED, 415, WE HAVE BEEN IN DISCUSSION WITH THE PROPERTY OWNERS AS FAR AS ELIMINATING A DRIVEWAY AT THAT LOCATION BECAUSE THE GRADE THERE IS SO STEEP AND THEY HAVE A DRIVEWAY OFF THREE PLACE. THEY ARE NOT OPEN TO THAT IDEA AT THIS TIME. AT 515, THERE'S SOME LONG BAMBOO IN THE OFFICE THERE, BUT IT -- IT'S CURRENTLY IN THE RIGHT-OF-WAY. THE SIDEWALK WILL BE IN THE PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY. IT WILL NOT BE ON PRIVATE PROPERTY. WE HAVE TO TRIM SOME OF THAT BACK. IT GROWS SO FAST. AND AT 527, THE FORESTRY LOOKED INTO THE TREES THAT ARE CURRENTLY THERE. THEY ARE TREES THAT CAN TAKE A LOT OF ROOT DAMAGE. SO THOSE, WE DON'T FEEL THAT THEY WILL BE REMOVED AT THIS TIME WE WILL LOOK INTO THEM NEXT WINTER IF THE SIDEWALK WERE TO GO IN AND SEE HOW THEIR HEALTH IS BUT THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE RESILIENT. AND AT 701, THIS WAS ONE TREE THAT WOULD BE REMOVED. I SPOKE TO THE PROPERTY OWNER. HE'S FINE WITH US MITIGATING A FOUR-INCH TREE THAT WAS IN THE RAMP LOCATION AND ANOTHER LARGE TREE THAT WAS VERY CLOSE TO THE SIDEWALK. HE WANTS US TO REMOVE.
04:57:30.041: >> Councilmember Bannister: OKAY. JANE, ON THAT -- OKAY. SO AT 527, WE WOULD JUST KEEP ALL OF THOSE TREES THERE. WE HOPE THEY WON'T DIE BUT THEY WILL NOT BE PROACTIVELY REMOVED?
04:57:44.322: >> RIGHT. AND IT'S TOO LATE IN THE SEASON TO REMOVE THE TREES BECAUSE THAT NEEDS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF IN THE WINTER TIME, BASED ON THE NATURAL HABITAT FOR BATS.
04:57:54.732: >> Councilmember Bannister: OKAY. SO THIS IS THE KIND OF INFORMATION THAT I'M LEARNING NOW THAT WE HAVEN'T BEEN TALKING AS WE WENT ALONG, WHICH IS PART OF THE CONFUSION ON THE -- AND THE FRUSTRATION AND THE ANXIETY ON THESE PROJECTS.
04:58:13.184: >> THE PROJECT PLANS ARE CURRENTLY ON THE PROJECT WEBSITE. THEY DO SHOW THE PROPOSED SIDEWALK. EACH PROPERTY OWNER GOT A PARCEL MAP THAT SHOWED WHERE THE SIDEWALK WOULD BE AND THAT INCLUDED TREES ON THE PARCEL MAPS. THAT'S WHY I DID GET A PHONE CALL FROM 701 BARTON REGARDING HIS TREES.
04:58:35.306: >> Councilmember Bannister: OKAY. WELL, I DON'T BELIEVE THAT COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER AND I ARE IN THE LOOP ON THAT, TRY AS WE MIGHT.
04:58:45.683: >> IT WAS A PHONE CONVERSATION. IT WASN'T AN EMAIL THAT WAS INCLUDED WITH CITY COUNCILMEMBERS.
04:58:53.825: >> Councilmember Bannister: OKAY. SO ON 415, IF YOU ARE UNABLE TO RESOLVE -- WHAT IS THE HIGH END OF HOW THEIR FINAL ASSESSMENT MIGHT END UP? WE HAVE GOT 13,826, BUT SINCE THE PLAN IS STILL UP IN THE AIR, WOULD --
04:59:17.081: >> THAT WAS A ARE E DEUCED ASSESSMENT FROM THE ORIGINAL ESTIMATE IN RESOLUTION TWO, BECAUSE THE BID CAME IN LOWER SO I REDUCED ALL THE ASSESSMENTS AND THE LETTERS WENT OUT TO ALL THE RESIDENTS. BECAUSE OF THE DIFFICULTY WITH THE GRADE HAVING TO PUT A SIDEWALK IN AND ALSO THE DRIVEWAY IS CURRENTLY SO STEEP, PUTTING A SIDEWALK IN THAT'S ONLY 2% SLOPE TO THE ROAD, WHERE THEY ARE CURRENTLY ABOUT 14% ON THEIR DRIVEWAY, IT WOULD CAUSE THE APPROACH TO THEIR DRIVEWAY TO BE ABOUT 28%, WHICH IS -- IS NOT RECOMMENDED. SO THEY ALSO CLAIM THEY DIDN'T WANT A SWITCHBACK BECAUSE IN ORDER TO PUT IN A RAMP OR ACRO CROSSWALK NEAR LONGSHORE IT WOULD CAUSE US TO PUT IN A SWITCH BACK. SO STAFF DID REACH OUT TO THEM. WE TRIED TO NEGOTIATE REMOVING THE DRIVEWAY. WE WOULD BE ELIMINATE TO ELIMINATE THE SWITCHBACK AND THE CITY WOULD BE SAVING MONEY ON THE PROJECT BECAUSE WE COULD ELIMINATE THE SWITCHBACK, SOME RAILING FOR THE SWITCHBACK AND THEIR DRIVEWAY APPROACH. SO I CONTACTED THEM WITH A NEW ASSESSMENT COST, OF COST SAVINGS AND TEMPORARY GRADING PERMIT THAT WAS CLOSE TO $900, AND THEY HAVE REFUSED THE REDUCED ASSESSMENT.
05:00:38.429: >> THE ASSESSMENT ROLL THAT IS PRESENTED WITH THIS ASSESSMENT IS THE ASSESSMENT ROLL. IF APPROVED, THE $13,000 IS THE ASSESSMENT FOR THAT PROPERTY. SO IT WOULDN'T BE GOING ANY HIGHER THAN THAT, CERTAINLY.
05:00:57.748: >> Councilmember Bannister: OKAY. AND I GUESS I'M DONE WITH QUESTIONS AND LET EVERYBODY GET ON OTHER THAN IN THE AGENDA RESPONSES YOU HAD MENTIONED, OR SOMEONE HAD RESPONDED THAT THERE WAS NEW TECHNIQUES AND NEW MATERIALS WHERE THE CONCRETE WOULD -- THAT IS THE SUPER HIGH CARBON EMITTER WOULD NOT BE USED AND THERE COULD BE SOME RECYCLED MATERIALS AND HAS STAFF DONE ANY WORK ON -- ON NOT USING CARBON EMITTING CONCRETE?
05:01:40.458: >> WE'RE USING STANDARD CONCRETE ON THIS PROJECT, FOR THE SIDEWALK, THE CURB AND GUTTER AND ANY OTHER PROJECT WE ARE DOING. WE KEEP AN EYE ON DEVELOPING TECHNOLOGY IN TERMS OF NEW CONCRETE PRODUCTS. THERE ARE THINGS BEING DEVELOPED AT THE U OF M. THEY ARE NOT READY FOR THE MARKET AT THIS TIME. BUT WE WILL CONTINUE TO, YOU KNOW, MONITOR THAT AND IF THE PRODUCT DOES BECOME, YOU KNOW, AVAILABLE -- READILY AVAILABLE ON THE MARK AND IS, YOU KNOW, REASONREASONABLABLY PRICED, THEE WILL CERTAINLY LOOK TOWARDS USING IT. WELL, THANKS FOR ALL OF THOSE ANSWERS. I THINK I'M GOING TO VOTE YES ON TWO OF THE SIDEWALKS BUT NOT THE OTHER TWO, BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S TOO MANY PROBLEMS WITH THIS PARTICULAR ONE AND THAT EVENTUALLY -- I'M NOT -- THE NEIGHBORS AREN'T SAYING THEY WOULD NEVER TAKE A SIDEWALK HERE, BUT I'M -- I THINK THE WAY THE CURRENT PLAN IS, I'M GOING TO SADE WITH THEM ON THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT. TWO OUT OF THE THREE.
05:02:54.932: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU.
05:02:56.300: >> Mayor Taylor: I'M SORRY, COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER, WERE YOU COMPLETED?
05:02:59.670: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES.
05:03:01.072: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
05:03:02.206: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. I'M EXTRAORDINARILY FRUSTRATED WITH THESE SIDEWALK PROJECTS. I'M GOING TO VOTE FOR ALL OF THEM. IF -- IF WE DON'T LIKE THE POLICY, IT'S OUR JOB AND I THINK SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES, COUNCILMEMBER SMITH POINTED THIS OUT, CHANGE IT! THAT'S OUR JOB. WE MAKE POLICY. SO IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT, FACE THE REAL TRADEOFFS AND DON'T ASK STAFF TO COME UP WITH MONEY THAT'S NOT THERE FOR YOUR PARTICULAR WARD. THAT'S AN EQUITY ISSUE. THAT'S TO THE OKAY. WE SOMETIMES HAVE TO EXPLAIN TO CONSTITUENTS THAT WE HAVE A POLICY THAT PROMOTES PEDESTRIAN SAFETY AND FILLING IN SIDEWALK GAPS AND YOU CAN DO THAT AND DO THE WORK IT MIGHT NOT ALWAYS MAKE THEM REAL HAPPY WITH YOU, OR YOU CAN WORK WITH THEM TO OBSTRUCT THE PROCESS. AND THIS IS -- YOU KNOW, I'M JUST GOING TO BE REALLY FRANK BECAUSE I'M FRUSTRATED AND I SEE A PATTERN ESPECIALLY IN THE FIRST WARD WITH SIDEWALK PROJECTS OF OBSTRUCTION, OF ON SI FEWCATION, SOME OF THE SENTENCES CAME OUT OF YOUR MOUTH, COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER, THERE WAS LITERALLY A SENTENCE THAT TALKED ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE, PERSONAL FINANCE, A GLOBAL PANDEMIC, LIKE INNOVATION AND NATURAL FEATURES ALL IN THE SAME SENTENCE, LIKE THAT'S REAL OBFUSCATION TO ME. AND I'M JUST FRUSTRATED BECAUSE WE ARE REALLY -- WE ARE CAUSING MAJOR PROBLEMS IN TERMS OF PEDESTRIAN SAFETY IN THE CITY IF WE CAN'T MAKE THESE DECISIONS. AND IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE POLICY, MR. CRAWFORD'S OFFERED TO WORK WITH YOU ON THIS. THERE ARE LOTS OF US -- BUT YOU HAVE TO BE WILLING TO ACCEPT THE TRADEOFFS. THIS IS A HARD JO JOBS SOMETIMES AND IT WON'T BE GETTING EASIER IN THE COMING MONTHS. WE WILL HAVE TO BE WILLING TO MAKE A TOUGH DECISION SOMETIMES EVEN IF IT'S -- AS OPPOSED TO JUST SAYING THAT THE NEIGHBOR GETS TO DECIDE AND THE REST OF US GETS TO NOT -- YOU KNOW, NOT TO BE AS SAFE AS KIDS ARE WALKING TO SCHOOL OR WALKING TO MAJOR AMENITIES LIKE THE SECOND MOST POPULAR PARK IN THE CITY, WHEN THINGS OPEN UP. SO THIS IS -- YOU KNOW, I JUST WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT, LIKE, THESE DECISIONS HAVE REAL CONSEQUENCES FOR PEOPLE'S SAFETY AND SOMETIMES WE HAVE TO BE WILLING TO SAY TO CONSTITUENTS, LIKE, I'M SORRY THAT THIS IS NOT HOW YOU WANT THINGS, BUT I'M NOT GOING TO WORK WITH YOU TO OBSTRUCT THE PROCESS. I'M GOING TO WORK FOR THE BENEFIT OF EVERYONE IN THE CITY. BECAUSE WE NEED TO KEEP PEOPLE SAFE AND THIS IS THE POLICY THAT WE HAVE. AND IF NOT, CHANGE IT.
05:05:53.744: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
05:05:55.446: >> Councilmember Hayner: YEAH, I LIVE WITHIN A HALF MILE OF THIS MISSING SIDEWALK GAP FOR 31 YEARS AND SO YOU ARE NOT GOING TO PIN THE LACK OF SAFETY ON YOUR CURRENT FIRST WARD REPS, COUNCILWOMAN GRAND, AND SO, YOU KNOW, IF YOU ARE HAPPY TO SPEAK TO THE ISSUE, BUT THE -- THE DISMARRIAGING OF OTHER PEOPLE'S COMMENTS IS NOT WELCOMED.
05:06:23.274: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. SORRY COUNCILWOMAN GRISWOLD. I TRY TO LOOK ON THE RAISED HAND SIDE, THE ELECTRONIC RAISED HAND. THAT'S SOMETIMES WHY I THINK I HAVE BEEN MISSING YOU, MY APOLOGIES. AGO OH, I DO>> Councilmember Gr OH, I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE MISSED ME. MY LITTLE HAND KEEPS MISSING. ONE IS, I THINK THIS IS A NEW DAY. EARLIER TONIGHT, WE APPROVED A QUARTER MILLION DOLLARS FOR EMERGENCY FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE DUE TO THE PANDEMIC. SO WE'RE ACTUALLY SPENDING CITY MONEY TO HELP SOME CITIZENS BECAUSE OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS WE'RE IN TELL SAME TIME WE'RE BILLING OTHER CITIZENS FOR SIDEWALKS THEY DON'T WANT. ANOTHER THING IS PARKS WITHOUT SIDEWALKS, RIGHT IN THIS AREA. SO IT'S OKAY TO BILL THE HOMEOWNER BUT IT'S NOT OKAY TO PUT THE SIDEWALK IN WHERE THE PARK IS? AND THE THIRD THING IS WE HAVE MANY EXAMPLES OF ROADWAY CONSTRUCTION WHERE THE HOMEOWNERS SAID WE DON'T WANT A SIDEWALK, AND BECAUSE THEY HAD THE POLITICAL CLOUT, A SIDEWALK WAS NOT CONSTRUCTED. I TOTALLY AGREE, WE NEED TO FILL THE SIDEWALK GAPS AND WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE ORDINANCE. WE NEED TO LOOK AT OUR PRACTICES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE BEING CONSISTENT THROUGHOUT THE CITY. TAME COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, IF I RECOMMEND CORRECTLY, THIS IS NUMBER THREE. I FORGET. I DON'T KNOW WHERE WE ARE.
05:08:13.317: >> Councilmember Lumm: I GUESS I HAD A QUESTION FOR STAFF.
05:08:17.755: >> Mayor Taylor: SURE.
05:08:18.255: >> Councilmember Lumm: IF I MAY QUICKLY. OKAY. SO THE STATEMENT WAS JUST MADE THAT IF PEOPLE HAVE CLOUT, AND THERE'S A CONSTRUCTION PROJECT ON THEIR STREET, AND A SIDEWALK IS TO BE INSTALLED, THEY GET A PASS. I AM NOT AWARE OF ANY SITUATION WHERE THAT'S OCCURRED, BUT I COULD BE DEAD WRONG. YOU KNOW, RECENTLY THE BIGGEST SIDEWALK INSTALLATION IN -- WELL, WE HAD QUITE A FEW IN THE SECOND WARD, BUT ONE LARGE ONE THAT WAS ATTACHED TO A LARGE PROJECT ON GEDDES AVENUE, WHERE WE PUT IN WATER MAINS AND SANITARY SEWERS, STORMWATER DETECTION AND SIDEWALKS. THAT INVOLVED A LOT OF DAMAGE DISRUPTION, LANDSCAPE, TREE REMOVAL, IT WAS VERY, VERY COSTLY FOR EVERY HOMEOWNER AND I CAN ASSURE YOU, NO ONE GOT A PASS. THERE WERE LOTS OF CONCERNS RAISED AND SIMILARLY, WITH -- SO I SAID I HAVE A QUESTION. I APOLOGIZE. ARE THERE EXAMPLES WHERE PEOPLE HAVE GOTTEN A PASS AND --
05:09:32.129: >> I AM NOT AWARE OF ANY PERSONALLY.
05:09:35.466: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANKS.
05:09:36.100: >> WHENEVER WE BUILT NEW SIDEWALK, WE FOLLOWED CITY CODE AND DONE THE ASSESSMENT.
05:09:40.504: >> I WOULD JUMP IN ALSO AND SAY WE NOT ONLY FOLLOW CITY CODE. WE FOLLOW THE CITY POLICY OF COMPLETE STREETS WHICH IS TO PUT SIDEWALKS IN IF THEY ARE PHYSICALLY POSSIBLE. THE ONLY PLACES WE DON'T PUT THEM IN IS WHERE COUNCIL TELLS US NOT TO.
05:10:00.891: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU.
05:10:01.692: >> Councilmember Hayner:  WE HAVE AN EXAMPLE. THERE'S AN EXAMPLE ON DHU VARREN WHERE THEY DID ALL OF THIS WORK AND THEY DIDN'T PUT A SIDEWALK IN.
05:10:12.169: >> Councilmember Lumm: MY QUESTION WAS ANSWERED.
05:10:13.704: >> Mayor Taylor: LET ME OBSERVE THAT THIS PART OF THE CONVERSATION IS DEVOLVING AND IF WE -- IF PEOPLE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT WHAT HAS BEEN SAID AT THE TABLE WITH RESPECT TO SIDEWALKS THAT HAVE GONE IN OR NOT GONE IN, PERHAPS THEY CAN RAISE THAT WITH THE COUNCILMEMBER WHO BROUGHT THE ISSUE UP.
05:10:32.523: >> Councilmember Lumm: MAY I JUST FINISH? I KNOW THAT WAS --
05:10:35.626: >> Mayor Taylor: I'M NOT -- I'M NOT RUNNING THE CONVERSATION. I'M JUST OBSERVING. YOU HAVE THE FLOOR, COUNCILMEMBER.
05:10:40.998: >> Councilmember Lumm: I THINK YOU ARE DOING THE RIGHT THING TO WRAP THIS UP. AND I APPRECIATE THAT MY QUESTION WAS ANSWER. I DIDN'T WANT THE IMPLICATION OUT THERE, BECAUSE YEAH, I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED WITH ONE-ON-ONE CONVERSATIONS WITH LOTS OF RESIDENTS WHO HAVE, YOU KNOW, THESE VERY SIMILAR KIND OF CONCERNS AND STAFF WORKED VERY HARD WITH ENVIRONMENT PROPERTY OWNER THAT I HAVE EXPERIENCED, YOU KNOW, GOING THROUGH THIS PROCESS. AND -- AND, YOU KNOW, MADE THE SITE VISITS, BUT NOBODY GOT A PASS. I DON'T WANT TO IMPLY THAT, YOU KNOW, NECESSARILY THAT YOU PUSH BACK HARD ENOUGH, OKAY, YOU ARE TREATED DIFFERENTLY SOMEHOW. AND EVERYBODY IS TREATED PRETTY EQUITABLY HERE. SO I THINK THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION HELPED CLEAR THE AIR OPEN THAT.
05:11:37.354: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER, RAMLAWI AND THEN GRISWOLD.
05:11:40.691: >> Councilmember Bannister: OKAY. I CAN THINK OF -- I BELIEVE IT WAS LONGSHORE DRIVE IN 2019 THAT THEY WERE SUGGESTED THAT THEY NEEDED SIDEWALK AND THEY ALL SAID, NO, WE WOULD RATHER NOT, AND THE PROJECT QUIETLY WENT AWAY. AND ALSO ON THIS BREEDE BARTON DRIVE PROJECT. IT ORIGINALLY INCLUDED BREDE AND THEY SAID, NO WE DON'T WANT IT AND IT WAS SCRATCHED OFF THE DESIGN PLAN. THAT WAS ORIGINALLY -- THAT WAS A SUCCESS, THAT THAT WAS -- IT DIDN'T MAKE SENSE TO HAVE SUPPLY SIDEWALKS THERE AND THAT WAS IN THE ORIGINAL PLAN DESIGN AND THAT -- SO MAYBE THAT WAS WHAT COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD WAS REFERRING TO, A COUPLE OF THOSE WARD ONE PROJECTS WHERE THE CITY PROPOSED IT AND THE -- AND THE INNEIGHBORS SAID NO AND IT DID QUIETLY DISAPPEAR. WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SUGGEST AT THIS POINT IS THAT IF PEOPLE ARE SAYING THEY JUST WANT TO VOTE YES FOR THESE SIDEWALKS, THEN I WOULD ASK THAT WE WAIT TILL THE FIRST MEETING IN JUNE TO SEE THROUGH THE LENS OF PERSONAL FINANCES, AND THE AFTERMATH AND FALLOUT OF THE PANDEMIC AND POSSIBLE CHANGES IN CLIMATE CHANGE, THAT WE -- 30 DAYS MAY GIVE US MORE INFORMATION ABOUT EVERYONE'S INDIVIDUAL AND CITY PERSONAL FINANCES AND CITY FINANCES. SO I WOULD ASK FOR A POSTPONEMENT UNTIL THE FIRST MEETING IN JUNE.
05:13:28.966: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE A SECOND? SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER EATON. COUNCICOUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER, DISCUSSION POSTPONEMENT? FURTHER DISCUSSION ON THE BOTH PONEMENT.
05:13:41.845: >> Councilmember Nelson:  THAT WAS FOR THE FIRST MEETING IN JUNE?
05:13:45.115: >> Mayor Taylor: THE FIRST MEETING IN JUNE. I GOT A -- I'VE GOT A -- I'M GOING TO CLEAR THE QUEUE. I HAVE RAMLAWI AND SMITH. IF WE GET BACK TO THE MAIN MOTION, TRY TO REMIND ME THAT YOU ARE UP.
05:13:57.761: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. SORRY THIS IS GOING ON. BUT EVERY TIME THE SIDEWALK GAPS COME UP, IT WILL. ESPECIALLY IN FIRST WARD. HUANG -- WHEN WILL THE RESIDENTS OF THESE PROPERTIES BE GIVE EBBE FINANCIAL -- WHEN THEY DO HAVE TO START PAYING FOR THESE. AS COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTERRER AND OTHERS HAVE ALLUDED TO, THE IF MANY FALLOUT. WHEN DO THEY HAVE TO PAY FOR THESE IF THESE PROJECT COMMENCES WITHOUT ANY FURTHER DELAY?
05:14:45.943: >> I -- IT'S A QUESTION FOR THE TREASURER. I DON'T THINK HE'S IN ON THIS. -- TOM, CORRECT ME IF I GO TOO FAR ASTRAY. IT'S USUALLY THE YAO ERR FOLLOWING THE COMCOMPLETION OF CONSTRUCTION IS WHEN IT STARTS SHOWING UP ON THE TAX ROLLS.
05:15:12.369: >> City Admin. Crawford: WE HAVE THE CITY ASSESSOR HERE IF WE HAVE A QUESTION. I BELIEVE IF IT WAS APPROVED TODAY, FIRST ASSESSMENT WOULD BE IN JULY OF 2021. IS THAT RIGHT, JERRY? YOU ARE MUTED MANY MARKEY. MR. MARKEY.
05:15:35.158: >> SORRY ABOUT THAT. YES, THAT'S CORRECT. IT WOULD BE A JULY TAX BILL AND MOST LIKELY BE THE JULY 2021.
05:15:49.706: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  YOU KNOW, THAT'S 14 MONTHS OUT RIGHT NOW BEFORE ANY TYPE OF BILL IS BEING SENT TO ANYBODY. I FRANKLY DON'T THINK THAT THE IF MANY IMPACT HAS THAT MUCH WEIGHT TO IT. A 14-MONTH LEAD TIME. I'M STRONGLY DISAPPOINTED THAT THIS CONVERSATION HAS TAKEN AS LONG AS IT HAS. WE DID HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY, AS I STATED THE FIRST TIME TO FUND THIS A DIFFERENT WAY AND IT WAS TURNED DOWN BY A COUNCILMEMBER FROM THE FIRST WARD. SO I AM NOT SUPPORT ON A POSTPONEMENT.
05:16:37.087: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
05:16:38.088: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I THINK MINE WAS ON THE MAIN MOTION REGARDING SIDEWALKS THAT HAVEN'T BEEN PUT IN, BUT --
05:16:52.702: >> Mayor Taylor: WE'LL COME BACK TO THAT ONCE WE COME TO THE POSTPONEMENT.
05:16:58.308: >> Councilmember Hayner:  THE RESOLVE SAYS THAT THE FIRST PAYMENT IS JULY 1st, 2020. AND INSTALLMENT INTEREST AT 3.5% INTEREST. SO I'M NOT SURE IF I'M READING A NOT UPDATED VERSION OF IT, BUT, YOU KNOW, I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM PUTTING THIS OFF FOR A MEETING, AS LONG AS IT DOESN'T SLOW DOWN THE CONSTRUCTION WHICH I THINK IS SUPPOSED TO START VERY SOON, IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN. I WILL SUPPORT POSTPONEMENT SINCE IT WAS SUPPORTED BY MY WARD COLLEAGUE AND I WILL HART SUPPORT HER IN ASKING WHATEVER SHE WANTS ABOUT SIDEWALKS FOR REPRESENTING THE PEOPLE OF OUR WARD.
05:17:38.949: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION POSTPONEMENT. ROLL CALL VOTE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
05:17:47.891: >> Clerk Beaudry: ON THE POSTPONEMENT.
05:17:49.526: >> Councilmember Nelson:  NO.
05:17:54.030: >> Councilmember Smith: NO.
05:17:54.631: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  NO.
05:17:56.833: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES.
05:17:59.302: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES. IS.
05:18:01.972: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES.
05:18:08.712: >> Councilmember Lumm: NO.
05:18:10.280: >> Councilmember Grand: NO.
05:18:10.881: >> Councilmember Ackerman: NO.
05:18:17.020: >> Mayor Taylor: NO.
05:18:17.787: >> Councilmember Eaton: YES.
05:18:18.388: >> Clerk Beaudry: THE MOTION FAILS.
05:18:20.824: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN MOTION. I THINK I HAD RAMLAWI, SMITH, GRISWOLD.
05:18:31.401: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I WILL MAKE IT BRIEF. THERE'S COMMENTS ABOUT THE OTHER SIDEWALK GAPS THAT COUNCIL HAS TURNED DOWN. WITH WE LOOK AT THESE THINGS, I ACTUALLY GO OUT THIS WHEN I CAN TO SEE WHAT THE CONDITIONS ARE. I'M NOT AN ENGINEER, BUT I THINK I HAVE A GOOD SENSE OF THINGS AS FAR AS BEING A PEDESTRIAN, MOTORIST AND CYCLIST, ALL THREE ALL THE TIME. NOT ASHAMED OF IT. AND THERE'S NO NEED TO PUT AN EXPENSIVE SIDEWALK ALONG THAT STRETCH BECAUSE WE HAVE A BEAUTIFUL BOARDWALK THERE. SPEND WHO HAS AN OPTION WOULD TAKE THAT BOARDWALK. IT'S ONE THE JEWELS THAT WE HAVE. SO THAT ARGUMENT, I'M SORRY, IT FELL FLAT WITH ME. AND I JUST WANT TO URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO VOTE YES ON ALL FOUR OF THESE. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE MOVE FORWARD ON THIS IF WENT TO GET ANYTHING DONE. I URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO VOTE YES ON ALL FOUR.
05:19:41.771: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER SMITH.
05:19:43.807: >> Councilmember Smith: I WOULD LIKE TO CALL THE QUESTION. I THINK EVERYBODY HAS SPOKEN ON THIS.
05:19:49.045: >> Mayor Taylor: I DON'T BELIEVE COUNCILMEMBER NELSON HAVE SPOKEN ON THIS NOR I OR EATON. IN THE OBSERVATION IS MAYBE WE CAN START VOTING, I GUESS -- I WOULD SECOND THAT MOTION. COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
05:20:04.961: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WANTED TO CLARIFY SOMETHING THAT SAID. AND PEOPLE THINK I TALK A LOT ABOUT CROSSWALKED BUT ACTUALLY, I GOT MY START IN 1995, GETTING A SIDEWALK PUT IN ON PEMBERTON, WHEN THE STREET WAS RESURFACED, A SIDEWALK WAS NOT PUT IN ON WALDENWOOD, WHEN THE STREET WAS RESURFACED, A SIDEWALK WAS NOT PUT I IN AND COUNCILMEMBER LUMM WAS HELPFUL IN GETTING THAT SIDEWALK PUT IN THAT WAS ADJACENT TO KING SCHOOL A FEW YEARS AGO. BUT WE ALSO HAVE ARLINGTON IN THE SECOND WARD THAT DOES NOT HAVE SIDEWALKS. AND ALSO GEDDES, WHAT I WILL A LOT OF WORK WAS DONE, THERE'S A SIDEWALK ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE STREET BUT THERE'S NOT ONE ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE STREET. I'M NOT ARGUING FOR SIDEWALKS IN THESE AREAS, I'M SAYING THAT OUR POLICY IS -- IS SOMEWHAT FLEXIBLE.
05:21:04.688: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN MOTION? ROLL CALL VOTE. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
05:21:12.862: >> Councilmember Lumm: ON GEDDES, IT WAS PUT ON NORTH SIDE BECAUSE THE STORMWATER DETENTION AND RAIN GARDENS WERE PUT ON THE SOUTH SIDE.
05:21:28.445: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN MOTION? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE ON THE MAIN MOTION STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
05:21:38.455: >> Councilmember Nelson:  YES.

05:22:11.020: >> Mayor Taylor: DS-2. RESOLUTION NO. 4, CONFIRMING THE BARTON DRIVE WATER MAIN REPLACEMENT & RESURFACING PROJECT SPECIAL ASSESSMENT DISTRICT NO. 60 - BARTON/STARWICK INTERSECTION. MOVED BY RAMLAWI, SECONDED BY ACKERMAN. DISCUSSION. ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
05:22:28.271: >> Councilmember Nelson:  YES.

05:23:11.881: >> Mayor Taylor: DS-3. RESOLUTION NO. 4, CONFIRMING THE NIXON AND TRAVER SIDEWALK GAP PROJECT DISTRICT 56. MOVED BY RAMLAWI. SECONDED BY SMITH. DISCUSSION OF DS-3. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
05:23:24.727: >> Councilmember Hayner: YEAH, I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE RIGHT ONES IF FRONT OF ME HERE. THIS IS THE EAST -- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE WEST SIDE OF THE NIXON IN THIS CASE? YOU KNOW, I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THIS IS A SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE HAD THERE WAS NO -- WE HAVE A SIDEWALK ON THE OTHER SIDE STREET FOREVER AND THEN WE LET NIXON FARMS GO TO DEVELOPMENT AND THEY LEFT THEIR LITTLE STUB. THERE WAS A SIDEWALK GAP THAT WAS CREATED. THERE WAS NOT A SIDEWALK GAP. THERE WAS NO NEED FOR THE SIDEWALK UNTIL WE PUT DEVELOPMENT AND HOPSCOTCHED OURSELVES WITH THIS DEVELOPMENT. AND I KNOW THAT IT'S -- WE HAVE LOOKED AT, YOU KNOW, THE EFFECT THAT KIND OF HOPSCOTCHING HAS ON ALL SORTS OF CITY INFRASTRUCTURE AND NOW WE ARE SEEING IT WRITTEN IN THESE SIDEWALKS. AND SO I JUST THROW THAT OUT THERE AS THE -- AS THE IDEA THAT WE'RE CREATING SIDEWALK GAPS WITH OUR HOPSCOTCHING OF DEVELOPMENT. AND NOW WE ARE COMING BACK AND STICKING THE HOMEOWNERS WITH THEM. AND, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE SOME APPEALS FROM PEOPLE WHO LIVE WEST OF LOGAN SCHOOL TO PLEASE MAKE SURE THIS SIDEWALK GETS PUT IN. I WAS TRYING TO READ THE LETTERS AND FOLLOW THE MAPS AND I KNOW THE AREA PRETTY WELL BECAUSE MY SON WENT TO LOGAN FOR A YEAR. I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE WOULD WALK A BLOCK PAST THE SCHOOL, BUT THAT'S THEIR PREROGATIVE AND IT'S THEIR PREROGATIVE TO DEMAND SOMEONE PAY FOR A SIDEWALK IN FRONT OF THEIR HOUSE. WHEN WE LOOK AT THESE DEVELOPMENT THINGS, THERE ARE OTHER OPPORTUNITIES TO FIND FUNDING FOR THIS SIDEWALK. THIS WOULD BE A GOOD SCAM TOM SAY GLOBAL COMPANY LIKE TOLL BROTHERS COULD HAVE EASILY DONE THE REST OF THE SIDEWALK ALL THE WAY TO TRAVER, IF ONLY WE HAD THE FORESIGHT TO REQUIRE IT OF THEM. I'M PUTTING THIS OUT THERE THAT THESE ARE IDEAS FOR THE FUTURE. BETTER WAYS TO MAKE NEW DEVELOPMENT A COMMON GOOD. THANK YOU.
05:25:42.565: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
05:25:44.567: >> Councilmember Lumm: I LIED WHEN I SAID I SPEAK TO ALL FOUR OF THESE. ON THIS ONE, I WANTED TO POINT OUT IN THE CITY STAFF RESPONSE AND THANKS FOR THE INFORMATION, IT WAS CONFIRMED THAT THE NIXON CORRIDOR PLAN WILL REQUIRE SIDEWALKS ANYWAY AND THE DESIGN WAS DONE IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE SIDEWALKS INSTALLED NOW WILL NOT NEED TO BE MODIFIED WHEN WE DO WATER IMPROVE PROJECT. WE HAVE A GRANT, A FEDERAL GRANT AND THAT HAS RESULTED IN A LOW ASSESSMENASSESSMENT SHARE OF 13. SO THERE'S A GREAT LEVERAGE IN THAT AND THAT WOULD BE LOST IF IT'S POSTPONED BECAUSE IT'S FOR THIS SPECIFIC PROJECT. AND I WILL JUST SAY THAT WHEN THE SIDEWALK ON THE OPEN SIDE SIDE OF THE STREET HERE, ON THE EAST SIDE, THE SECOND WARD SIDE. THAT WAS FOR SAFE WALKS TO SCHOOLS GRANT, AND COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD, SHE WASN'T A COUNCILMEMBER AT THE TIME AND SHE WORKED VERY HARD TO BRING THAT TO FRUITION, AND ALL OF THE FOLKS ALONG THAT SIDEWALK AND FRONTAGE I. PAID T AND PAID FOR. THE TOLL BROTHERS DID PAY FOR THE SIDEWALK ALONG THEIR PROPERTY. SO THEY WERE NOT TREATED ANY DIFFERENTLY THAN ANYONE ELSE TO MY KNOWLEDGE, AGAIN, I WILL BE SUPPORTING THAT. I THINK IT'S -- WE HAVE SO MANY MORE PEOPLE IN THIS AREA, LIKE 1,000 MORE UNITS OF HOUSING AND A LOT OF PEOPLE WALKING. AND WITH THE COVID PANDEMIC, IT'S BEEN BROUGHT TO MY KNOWLEDGE BY SOME OF THE NEIGHBORS, IT'S DIFFICULT TO DO THE SOCIAL DISTANCING BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE OUT WALKING HAVING THIS COMPLETED SIDEWALK ON BOTH SIDES OF THE STREET WOULD HELP IN THAT REGARD AS WELL. SO, AGAIN, THESE ARE PRIORITY SIDEWALK GAPS THAT ARE BEING ADDRESSED HERE. THANKS.
05:28:18.087: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
05:28:22.458: >> Councilmember Nelson:  YES.

05:29:11.040: >> Councilmember Lumm: JUST TO CLARIFY THAT THERE'S NO PUSHBACK AT ALL FOR THIS. IN FACT, THIS IS A SIDEWALK THAT MANY HAVE WANTED FOR A VERY LONG TIME. I APPRECIATE THE CONFIRMATION THAT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN WILL BE PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE, AS WILL BE THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE. SO THANK YOU.
05:29:44.640: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] ALL OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. ARE THERE COMMUNICATIONS FROM OUR CITY ATTORNEY?
05:30:05.394: >> City Atty. Postema: NO, MAYOR.
05:30:07.697: >> Mayor Taylor: WE HAVE BEFORE US THE CLERK'S REPORT OF COMMUNICATIONS, PETITIONS AND REFERRALS. MAY I HAVE A MOTION TO APRO OF THE CLERK'S REPORT?

05:31:26.809: >> Clerk Beaudry: MAYOR, THERE'S NO ONE.
05:31:29.011: >> Mayor Taylor: SEEING NO ONE, THE PUBLIC COMMENT IS CLOSED. IS THERE COMMUNICATION BY COUNCIL? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
05:31:36.719: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I JUST HAD A QUESTION AS TO THE PRACTICE OF HAVING ONLINE MEETINGS. DO WE BELIEVE OUR NEXT MEETING WILL BE CONDUCTED IN THE SAME FORM AND FASHION? I KNOW MOST LIKELY NEXT MONDAY WILL BUT THE MONDAY AFTER THAT AS WELL?
05:31:55.771: >> City Admin. Crawford: AT THIS POINT, WE ONLY KNOW NEXT MONDAY. THE GOVERNOR'S ORDER RUNS OUT ON THE 15th AND UNLESS THAT EXTENDED WE WOULD NOT HAVE -- MR. POSTEMA CAN CHIME IF YOU HAVE ADDITIONAL -- UNLESS IT'S EXTENDED PAST THE 15th, WE DON'T HAVE AUTHORIZATION TO DO SO.
05:32:16.325: >> City Atty. Postema: WELL, WE ARE STILL LOOKING AT THAT. I HAVE THINK THE ORDER CLARIFIES SOME THINGS BUT WE'RE STILL LOOKING AT WHETHER THERE'S A MECHANISM TO CONTINUE IT. I THINK IT'S PROBABLY IMPORTANT TO DO BUT IT WOULD -- WE'RE IN DISCUSSIONS ON THAT.
05:32:35.745: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  SO WE DON'T HAVE ANY -- WE DON'T HAVE DETAILS ON THAT, I GUESS.
05:32:42.885: >> Mayor Taylor: CAN WE PUT AN UPDATE CLOCK ON THIS? CAN YOU GET BACK TO US AS TO AN UPDATE AND EVEN IF THAT UPDATE IS WE DON'T KNOW YET?
05:32:54.697: >> City Admin. Crawford: YES.
05:32:55.331: >> City Atty. Postema: YES.
05:32:55.931: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU FOR THAT SUGGESTION.
05:32:56.932: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THAT'S AWESOME.
05:33:00.436: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER COMMUNICATION FROM COUNCIL? DO WE HAVE A CLOSED SESSION TODAY, MR. POSTEMA?
05:33:05.508: >> City Atty. Postema: WE DO NOT.
05:33:08.310: >> Councilmember Ackerman: DID COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER HAVE HIS HAND UP?
05:33:12.281: >> Mayor Taylor: YES, HE DID. MY APOLOGIES COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
05:33:15.251: >> Councilmember Hayner: YEAH, THANK YOU. I JUST WANT TO MAKE A GENERAL REMARK ABOUT THE TENOR OF OUR CONVERSATIONS HERE. I THINK IS APPROPRIATE TIME TO DO IT, UNTIL WE GET TO THE END HERE. YOU KNOW, I'M FORTUNATE IN THAT SOME OF MY COUNCIL COLLEAGUES ARE PERFECTLY WILLING TO RESPOND TO MY EMAILS, OR CALL ME WITH A PIN UP DATE OR COPY ME ON SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BE OF INTEREST TO ME. AND I'M ALSO FORTUNATE IN THAT SOME OF THEM HAVE TAKEN IT UPON THEMSELVES TO START UP THE -- THE SUNDAY NIGHT DIALOGUE, THE COUNCIL CAUCUS WHICH I APPARENTLY USED TO BE A PARTISAN AFFAIR WITH TWO DIFFERENT GROUPS MEETING, BUT NOW HAS BECOME MORE OF A SECONDARY OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PUBLIC TO ENGAGE IN MEANINGFUL WAYS WITH THE -- WITH THE COUNCIL AND HAVE CONVERSATIONS AND DO SOME. HARD WORK OF GOING OVER THE AGENDA. AND I HAVE  HAVEN'T ATTENDED MAF THOSE BECAUSE I WOULD READ RESPONSES AN GET FINAL QUESTIONS AND SO ON TOGETHER, BUT I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THAT THE CAUCUS HAPPENS AND PEOPLE BRING ME UP TO DATE ON WHAT HAPPENED AT THE CAUCUS. I JUST -- I JUST WANT TO BE REAL HONEST HERE AND SAY THAT I WAS DISAPPOINTED TO FIND THAT THERE WAS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE CAUCUS HAPPENING THAT OF THE 100 WAKING HOURS THAT SOMETHING ELSE COULD HAVE BEEN SCHEDULED THAT MANY MAYOR YOU DECIDED TO SCHEDULE YOUR FACEBOOK LIVE EVENT THE EXACT SAME TIME THAT CAUCUS WAS HAPPENING. I FOUND THAT NOT ONLY TO BE AN UNUSUAL SCHEDULING BUT UNUSUALLY DIVISIVE. AND SO WE HAVE A LOT OF THESE CONCERNS ABOUT SOCIAL MEDIA. WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE PEOPLE THAT YOU APPOINT, WHO, YOU KNOW, HARANGUE US ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND THEN WONDER WHY WE DON'T SUPPORT THEIR APPOINTMENTS. AND I THINK A LOT OF THESE NOT REALLY BIG PROBLEMS BUT SMALL PROBLEMS COULD BE SET ASIDE AND WORKED THROUGH AND HAVE A LITTLE MORE TOGETHERNESS. I'M FINDING THAT I'M NOT SURE HOW TO BRING THAT TOGETHERNESS TO THIS BODY. BUT I WISH FOR IT. AND SO I THINK WE COULD START BY NOT QUESTIONING OTHERS' VALUES AS TO WHY WE CHOOSE TO REPRESENT OUR CONSTITUENTS IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. AND I THINK WE COULD ALSO START BY HAVING COURTESIES LIKE RESPONDING TO EMAIL INQUIRIES AND THINGS. I MEAN, MR. MAYOR, YOU KNOW THAT I HAD TO PAY FOR A FOIA JUST TO SEE WHAT KIND OF EMAIL YOU DO, BECAUSE YOU NEVER ANSWER MY EMAILS. NEVER! AND IT'S NOT -- IT'S NOT WORKING. IT'S NOT WORKING FOR OUR RESIDENTS. IT'S NOT WORKING FOR ME AND IT'S CLEARLY NORTH WORKING FOR THIS BODY. AND -- NOT WORKING FOR THIS BODY. AND I KNOW  I WANTED TO GET THIS OFF MY CHEST WHEN SOME OF US ARE FORCED NOT TO WORK. I'M ENCOURAGING US ALL TO TAKE THAT EXTRA EFFORT TO NOT ONLY SHOW LEADERSHIP TO OUR COMMUNITY AND HELPFULNESS IN THIS TIME OF CRISIS, BUT TO TRY AND COME TOGETHER AS A BODY AND SET ASIDE WHATEVER KIND OF PETTY DIFFERENCES WE HAVE AND WORK FOR THE COMMON GOOD. SO THANK YOU FOR LISTENING.
05:36:37.953: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
05:36:39.088: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES. I JUST WANTED TO THANK STAFF AND THANK ALL OF YOU FOR SLOGGING THROUGH YET ANOTHER SIDEWALK PROBLEM. AND I WANTED TO SUMMARIZE -- WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS. THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF SUCCESS HERE. YOU KNOW, WE WERE ABLE TO GET RID OF THE INAPPROPRIATE SIDEWALKS ALONG BARTON FROM M-14 UP TO BREDE AND WE ARE DOING A LOT BETTER JOB AT LISTENING TO THE RESIDENTS AND COMMUNICATING WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THEM WITH THE SIDEWALK GAP PROJECT, NOTIFYING THEM AND -- YOU KNOW, WE HAVE COUNCILMEMBER NELSON'S RESIDENT GAP PROGRAM HAS COME OUT OF THESE DISCUSSIONS. SO WE'RE MAKING SOME GOOD PROGRESS FROM WHERE WE USED TO BE. LISTENING TO THE PEOPLE AND TRYING TO IMPROVE OUR SIDEWALK PROCESS. MY ONE QUESTION, THOUGH, FOR PERHAPS TOM CRAWFORD WOULD, WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE IF WE WANT TO LOOK AT CHANGING THIS SPECIAL ASSESSMENT POLICY?
05:37:51.460: >> City Admin. Crawford: I WOULD BE HAPPY TO GET SOME STAFF AND PETE WITH A COUPLE OF COUNCILMEMBERS WHO EXPRESSED INTEREST IN THAT AND LOOK AT AN ORDINANCE REVISION THAT COULD COME BACK TO COUNCIL FOR CONSIDERATION. THE -- I JUST WANT TO -- YEAH, THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE COULD GET IN THIS YEAR. I WOULDN'T SAY WE CAN GET IT IN THIS NEXT MONTH MAYBE BECAUSE -- BUT THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN WORK WITH YOU ON.
05:38:16.518: >> Councilmember Bannister: WELL, IF WE DON'T HAVE ANY NEW SIDEWALKS ON THE HORIZON ISSUES WE DON'T NEED TO HURRY UNLESS IT NEEDS TO BE ON THE BALLOT.
05:38:26.595: >> City Admin. Crawford: WELL, THE ORDINANCE YOU GUYS HAVE THE ABILITY TO CHANGE AND I'M HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU ON A PROPOSAL THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO BRING FORWARD.
05:38:35.504: >> Councilmember Bannister: OKAY. AND THERE AGAIN, IF WE DON'T -- IF THERE AREN'T ANY SIDEWALK GAP PROJECTS IN THE WORKS, THEN THAT LOWERS ITS PRIORITY.
05:38:45.881: >> City Admin. Crawford: I DID CHECK AND IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S ANOTHER ONE COMING BUT IT DID NOT SOUND AS CHALLENGING AS SOME OF THE ONES THAT WE CUT A DEAL WITH RECENTLY.
05:38:55.524: >> Councilmember Bannister: GREAT. THANK YOU.
05:39:00.462: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
05:39:01.463: >> Councilmember Grand: I WANTED TO RESPOND TO COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER'S COMMENTS BECAUSE I THINK A LOT OF THEM ARE ABOUT ME. SO I REALLY DID -- AND I REALLY SINCERELY MEAN THIS. I HAD THE PLEASURE OF HAVING THESE MEETING WITH COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD AND STAFF WHERE I THINK WE WORKED TOGETHER EFFECTIVELY TO FIND COMMON GROUND BECAUSE WE BOTH DARED ABOUT GETTING THIS DONE AND BEING RESPONSIVE TO RESIDENTS. WE MIGHT HAVE HAD SOME DIFFERENCES AND WE COMPROMISED AND WORKED IT OUT. I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE BUT I THINK IT HAS TO COME FROM A PLACE OF -- OF WILLINGNESS TO DO THAT. AND I APPRECIATE STAFF'S ROLE IN THAT. I ALSO THINK IT COMMONS FROM A PLACE OF ACKNOWLEDGING OURSELVES AND IF WE'RE GOING TO CALL CERTAIN -- YOU KNOW, CERTAIN VOLUNTEERS OUT FOR THEIR SOCIAL MEDIA THEN I THINK IT NEEDS TO START -- IT NEEDS TO START WITH YOURSELF, RIGHT? AND COMMENTS THAT -- COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE BOTH IN THE PAST AND, SAY, IN THE LAST WEEK ON SOCIAL MEDIA MAYBE WITH NAUSEOUS AND CRYING EMOJIS ABOUT SOMEONE'S STEPMOM. SO IT HAS TO START -- YOU KNOW, I THINK WE JUST HAVE TO -- IF WE ARE GOING TO CRITICIZE OTHERS, I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT OUR OWN BEHAVIOR,
