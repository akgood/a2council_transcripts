FILL IN ANY GAPS AND THEN WE'LL HAVE THE PUBLIC HEARING BEFORE OUR DISCUSSION.
00:13:48.166: >> THANK YOU. SO THIS IS THE MILL CREEK TOWNHOMES REZONING AND SITE PLAN. ED THE LANDSCAPE MODIFICATIONS. THE ADDRESS IS 302 CHELSEA CIRCLE. THE REZONING OF THE PETITION IS THE SITE IS CURRENTLY ZONED R THREE, TOWNHOUSE DWELLING.
00:14:10.822: >> JILL YOU'RE RUSTY BEING TIME AWAY. WE'RE GOING TO GO TO THE COMMISSIONER PRESENTATION FIRST AND LET YOU FILL IN THE GAPS AFTER.
00:14:18.696: >> GOT IT.
00:14:20.498: >> THANK YOU FOR FILLING TWO AWKWARD SOUND WHILE I'M ADJUSTING EVERYBODY'S -- ALL RIGHT. MR. HIRSCH, YOU SHOULD BE GETTING PERMISSION TO SHARE YOUR PRESENTATION. THERE
00:14:46.658: >> THANK YOU. SO IF I FEEL THANKS TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION FOR BEING HERE AND HEARINGS OUR PROJECT TONIGHT. JUST AS A REMINDER WE'RE BACK KIND OF ONCE AGAIN, WE DID BRING IN BEFORE PLANNING COMMISSION IN A WORK SESSION IN OCTOBER OF 2020 AND CON ACCEPTABLE FORMAT SO WE'VE WORKED TO INCORPORATE THE COMMENTS FROM THAT MEETING AS WELL AS THE STAFF COMMENTS DURING THE REVIEW PROCESS AND CONSIDERED THE FEEDBACK FROM THE RESIDENTS TO BRING THE PRESENTATION THAT WE HAVE AND THE PROJECT FOR YOU TONIGHT. I'LL JUST OF START OFF WITH THE DEVELOPMENT TEAM HERE. WE HAVE MIKE MARTIN, DARREN McKINNON FROM FIRST MARTIN, DARREN IS NOT HERE TONIGHT BUT MIKE MARTIN IS STANDING IN. MYSELF TOMCO BETTER AND TINA FIX AS CIVIL AND LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTS FROM MID WESTERN CONSULTING AND WAYNE HOPEN FROM ARCHITECTS WITH US TONIGHT WHO ALSO DID WORK ON THIS PROJECT AS WELL. SO JUST TO GO OVER THE SITE LOCATION AND GET SOME BACKGROUND CONTEXT, WE HAVE A SITE HERE BY I-94 TO THE SOUTH STONE SCHOOL ROAD TO THE WEST. WE CAN SEE THE CURRENT SOUTHERNING MAP HERE SURROUND BY SIMILARLY ZONED R 3 OR FOURA TO THE NORTH R ONE C TO THE NORTHWEST AND MARY BETH DEFENSIVELY PARK TO THE EAST. SO AS JILL MENTIONED R THREE ZONING DISTRICT IS TOWNHOUSE DISTRICTS, THE ZONING, KIND OF SOME STATS HERE T IT ALLOWS FOR TEN UNITS PER ACRE, WE HAVE 21 EXISTING UNITS AT THE SITE WHICH IS ABOUT EIGHT AND A HALF UNITS PER ACRE BUT THEY ONLY HAVE THE ONE TYPE HOME WHICH IS THE TOWNHOME STYLE. AND A COMMUNITY CENTER AS THIS DEVELOPMENT WAS BUILT IN THE 1970S. SO THE REASON -- WE HAVE A COUPLE OF CRITERIA THAT WE FEEL FITS THE NEEDS FOR THIS INFOLLOW PROJECT. TELOSESES FOR DIVERSIFY OCCASION OF HOUSING, ALLOWS US TO PROPOSE SOME STACKED FLAT APARTMENT BUILDINGS. PROVIDING OPPORTUNITY FOR MORE POTENTIAL TENANTS, DIFFERENT WIDER RANGE, I GUESS. WE ALSO HAVE THE DENSITY THAT IS MAXED OUT BY REZONING. WE'RE PROPOSING 10290S WHICH WOULD BE BOTH OF THAT MAXIMUM FOR R THREE BUT WELL UNDER THE MAXIMUM FOR R FOUR B FOR THE ENTIRE SITE AND WE'RE ALSO INCLUDING THE INFILL OF THE SIDEWALK GAPS ON BIRCH HOLLOW ROAD AS A KIND OF PRECURSOR TO THE MORE IMPORTANT POINTS OF THIS PROJECT. WE'LL GO OVER THE NEW BUILDING, THIS IS KIND OF THE INFILL AREA, KIND OF A MOD ETC.KEST AREA OF THE DEVELOPMENT. THE EXISTING COMMUNITY CENTER EXISTED ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF BIRCH HOLLOW SO THAT WILL BE DEMOLISHED AND REBUILT ON THE NORTH SIDE MAKING ROOM FOR THREE NEW APARTMENT BUILDINGS. THIS FOURTH OVER HERE TO THE EAST. SO THE NEW COMMUNITY CENTER WILL HAVE UPDATE AMENITIES, POOL AND PROVIDE A MODERNIZED FACILITY FOR ALL THE TENANTS. TAKING A LOOK AT THE OVER ALL LAYOUT HIRE, AGAIN KIND OF A MODEST AREA FOR THE INFILL HERE. AND THEN SHOWING SOME OF OVERALL SITE -- THE PROJECT ASPECTS. AGAIN WE SEE THE GREEN DASHED LINES HERE ARE ALL AREAS WHERE EXISTING SIDEWALK -- I'M SORRY, SIDEWALK DOES NO EXIST. IT EXISTS FROM STONE SCHOOL TO MARY BETH DO I RECALL PARK BUT NOT THE NORTH SO WE'RE MAKING THOSE CONNECTIONS AND INCREASING THAT PED CONNECTIVITY. ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE ALSO INCORPORATED THROUGHOUT THE REVIEW PROCESS WAS INCLUSION OF A RAISED CROSSWALK HERE TO HELP TRAFFIC WHICH WE THINK IS GOING TO BE A NICE ADDITION TO THE PROJECT. SO WE HAVE SOME BASIC CALCULATIONS HERE FOR THE PARKING SPACES. THE R THREE TOWNHOUSE ZONING DISTRICT REQUIRES TWO PARKING SPACES PER UNIT AND THAT'S WHAT THE SITE IS CURRENTLY PARKED AT OR AROUND THERE. THE REZONING TO THE R FOUR B WAS WOULD REQUIRE THE ONE AND A HALF PER UNIT BUT THE PROPOSED PARKING FIELDS WE'RE PROPOSE TO ONE SPACE PER UNIT SO IT BRINGS DOWN THE TOTAL FOR THE SITE BELOW THAT TWO PER UNIT, WHICH I THINK IS APPROPRIATE AND THE AMOUNT OF PARKING THAT'S ACTUALLY NECESSARY. WE GET A LOOK AT THE PROPOSED EXISTING UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE HERE. KIND OF ANOTHER REASON THIS IS A GREAT CANDIDATE FOR INFILL DEVELOPMENT, ALL THE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE IS READILY AVAILABLE. WEWE HAVE WATER MAIN, SAME THING WITH SANITARY SEWER WHICH WE'RE EASILY ABLE THE CONNECT. THERE IS MINIMAL STORM WATER MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS AS FAR AS DETENTION OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT GOES SO PART OF THE PROJECT WOULD BE TO -- YOU SEE THESE BIG ORANGE HIGHLIGHTED AREAS, THAT WOULD ALL BE UNDERGROUND DENTION, STORINGND TREATING RUNO FROM EEVOPNT SLOWLY GO IN THEITY STORM SEWER RATHER THAN FREE FLOWING AS I ITOES NOW. TAKE A LOOK AT THE LANDSCAPING IT WAS MENTIONED THAT WE WERE REQUESTING MODIFICATIONS BUT AGAIN, KIND OF SIMILAR TO OTHER ASPECTS OF THE PROJECT, THAT'S JUST A REQUEST TO KEEP EVERYTHING EXISTING OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF THE INFILL AREA. AND NOT NECESSARILY BRING ALL OF THAT STUFF UP TO CURRENT STANDARDS AS AGAIN IT WAS ALL CONSTRUCTED IN THE 1970s KIND OF UNDER DIFFERENT REGULATIONS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. ALTHOUGH WE DO SEE ONE OF THE MOVESES WE'RE REQUESTING IS FOR LANDSCAPE -- THE CONFLICTING LANE USE BUFFERS THAT WOULD RESULT FROM THE REZONING AND THAT'S STRICTLY IN THE NUMBER OF TREES THAT ARE PROVIDED IN THOSE AREAS BUT AS YOU CAN SEE THE INTENT IS MET WITH THE EXISTING VEGETATION THAT IS AROUND THE SITE. SO WE ARE PROVIDING PROPOSED LANDSCAPING FOR THE INFILL AREA PER CURRENT CODE AND THEN WE'RE ALSO MAKING IMPROVEMENT TO THE STREET SCAPE BY EITHER PLANTING NEW OR RELOCALLING EXISTING STREET TREES AND AGAIN ADDING THAT SIDEWALK INFILL SO THAT KIND OF PRESENTS A NEW PHASE TWO TO BIRCH HOLLOW. SO RIGHT HERE YOU SEE THE APARTMENT BUILDINGS KIND OF AS A SUMMARY BUT ILL LIKE TO HAND IT OVER TO THE ARCHITECT WAYNE CHUCK TO GO OVER SOME OF THESE FINER ASPECTS.
00:23:32.516: >> GOT ABOUT A MINUTE AND A HALF.
00:23:35.753: >> OKAY. GREAT TO SEE MOST OF YOU AGAIN. I WON'T REITERATE A LOT OF WHAT TED SAID BUT THESE ARE THE THREE STORY STACKED FLATS. YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THE EXISTING COMPLEX, THEY'RE ALL TOWNHOME STYLE TWO BEDROOMS. WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING IS ALL ONE BEDROOM BUILDINGS. AND COUPLE DIFFERENT SIZES WITH OUTDOOR BALCONIES SO WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT THE DIVERSITY IT'S BRINGING TO THE PROJECT AS WELL AS THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND THE CITY. AND THE FRESH LOOK, THE CLUBHOUSE OF COURSE IS A GREAT AMENITY TO THE EXISTING TENAN SO BEING ABLE TO MAKE THAT ADA CLIENT IS ONE OF OUR MAJOR GOALS. YOU CAN SEE IN THE EXISTINGS UPPER LEFT HAND ATTORNEY. CORNER. BUT AGAIN A NEW AMENITY TO THE COMMUNITY. BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT THE EXISTING ARCHITECTURE IF ANYBODY HAS ANY.
00:24:43.888: >> SO JUST TO WRAP IT UP HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AND DISCUSS WITH ALL THE COMMISSIONERS THIS PROJECT AND ANYTHING THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE OR HAVE ANSWERED AND THEN ALSO THE GOAL TO RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE REZONING, THE SIDE PLAN AND THE LANDSCAPE MODIFICATIONS.
00:25:08.546: >> EXCELLENT JOB COMING IN AT JUST TEN MINUTES. THANK YOU. NOW, MS. THATCHER THINGS TO FILL IN FROM THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT'S PERSPECTIVE.
00:25:23.360: >> SURE. SO IN THE STAFF REPORT YOU HAVE THE STAFF'S ANALYSIS. BOTH THE ZONING AND SITE PLAN. THERE ARE TWO OUTSTANDING ISSUES UNDER THE STAFF COMMENTS ONE IS FOR TRANSPORTATION, ONE IS FROM ENGINEERING. REVISED PLANS HAVE BEEN SUBMIT AND ARE UNDER REVIEW BUT WE DO NOT HAVE THOSE BACK YET SO STAFF IS RECOMMENDING APPROVAL TO THE ZONE APPROVAL TO THE SITE PLAN SUBJECT TO SATISFACTORILY ADDRESSING THE OUT STANDING STAFF COMMENTS THAT ARE STILL COMING IN. IF YOU WANT MORE INFORMATION ON THOSE I HAVE THEM IN THE STAFF REPORT BUT OVERALL STAFF DOES BELIEVE THAT THIS MEETS ALL APPROPRIATE CODES. THANK YOU.
00:26:09.373: >> ALL RIGHT. LET'S MOVE THEN TO THE PUBLIC HEARING. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PERSONS TO SPEAK FOR UP TO MINUTES ABOUT THE PROPOSED MILL CREEK TOWN HOPES REZONING AND SIGH PLAN APPROVAL. IF YOU WISH TO ADDRESS THE ECONOMIES ON THIS ITEM PRESS STAR NINE IF YOU'RE LISTENING BY PHONE OR USE THE RAISE HAND FEATURE IF YOU ARE VIEWING THROUGH THE WEB LINK. IF YOU ARE WATCHING US AND WINTER WISH TO DIAL IN YOU THINK ACCESS THE MEETING THROUGH DIALING 877-8535 24/7 AND ENTERING THE MEETING ID. CITY STAFF WILL COLLECT CALLERS THAT HAVE RAISEs THEIR HANDS USING THE LAST THREE DIGITS OF YOUR TELEPHONE NUMBER OR CALLING ON YOU BY NAME IF YOU'VE JOINED US THROUGH THE WEB LINK. PLEASE COOP KEEP YOUR COMMENTS TO THREE MINUTES AND START OFF YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS. AGAIN IF YOU DIALED IN AND WANT THE PROVIDE A PUBLIC HEARING YOU CAN PRESS STAR NINE ON YOUR TELEPHONE. SEEING NONE I WILL START TO READ THE COUPLE OF MOTIONS BUT LENART IF YOU CAN LET ME KNOW IF SOMEBODY SNEAKS IN. WE HAVE TWO MOTIONS BEFORE US TONIGHT. THE FIRST IS ON THE RESORING AND THE SECOND IS ON THE SITE PLAN AND I'LL READ THEM BOTH. THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION HEREBY RECOMMEND IT IS MARE AND CITY COUNCIL APPROVE THE MILL CREEK TOWNHOMES REZONING FROM R THREE TOWNHOUSE DWELLING TO R B FOUR MULTIPLE FAMILY DWELLING. THE SECOND IS THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION RECOMMENDS THE MARE AND CITY COUNCIL APPROVE THE MILL CREEK TOWNHOME SITE PLAN WITH LANDSCAPE MODIFICATIONS TO ALLOW LANDSCAPED ELEMENTS WHICH ARE PART OF A PREVIOUSLY APPROVED SITE PLAN TO BE MAINTAINED AND CONTINUED AS NONCONFORMING IN AREAS WHERE NO AT RACES ARE PROPOSED. SUBJECT TO A VARIANCE GRANT BID THE ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS FOR PARKING SPACES. MOVED BY COMMISSIONER SAUVE SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER DISCH. WE ARE IN DISCUSSION AND I WANT TO NOTE THAT I'M STILL SEEING ON MY SCREEN THE PRESENTATION FROM THE PETITIONER WHICH MAY BE A USEFUL BUT IF ANYBODY WOULD LIKE TO GET THAT OFF THE SCREEN JUST LET ME KNOW. COMING . . . [INDISCERNIBLE]. SO I WAS EXCITED TO SEE THIS. I WASN'T HERE IN OCTOBER, I WASN'T SITTING ON THE PLANNING COMMISSION SO I MIGHT RAISE SOME THINGS THAT YOU ALREADY TALKED ABOUT BUT IT IS REALLY EXCITING TO SEE A PLAN FOR INFILL HOUSING AND THAT THAT WILL ADDRESS THE DIVERSITY OF HOUSING IN THIS PART OF TOWN. SO I'LL ASK A SILLY QUESTION WHICH IS YOUR POOL, I'M SO EXCITED THAT YOU'RE REFURBISHING YOUR POOL. IS THE LAP PART 25 YARDS? BECAUSE THAT'S NICE FOR PEOPLE. IF YOU HAVE A CHANCE THE MAKE IT 25-YARDS THAT WOULD BE GREAT. I DON'T LIVE THERE BUT IF I WERE A SWIMMER AND I LIVE THERE HAD THAT'S WHAT I WOULD WANT. I MEAN, I AM A SWIMMER AND IF I LIVED THAT THAT'S WHAT I WOULD WANT I. NOTICED THAT THE PUBLIC RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT THE PLAYGROUND THAT DOES EXIST SOUTH OF THE BIRCH HOLLOW ROAD NOW SO I WONDERED IF YOU HAD THOUGHT ABOUT -- IF YOU COULD RESPOND TO THAT. I KNOW YOU'RE THINKING THAT MARY BETOIL IS GREAT PLACE TO HAVE RENNING RATION AND THAT MAY BE TRUE BUT I CAN IMAGINE IF YOU HAVE PEOPLE THAT HAVE KIDS IN THIS COMPLEX, A PLAYGROUND WOULD BE NICE. AND THEN JUST I DID WANT TO INQUIRE IF THERE THERE WAS A DISCUSS IN OCTOBER ABOUT THE BIKE PARKING. SO I NOTICED THAT YOU ARE PROVIDING -- WAIT. YOU ARE PROVIDING AT THE COMMUNITY CENTER SIX CLASS C BIKE SPACES. MIGHT BE NICE TO HAVE MORE OF THOSE. YOUR DEVELOPMENT IS KIND OF BIG. I THINK IT WOULD BE GREAT IF PEOPLE WALKED THEIR BIKES TO THE COMMUNITY CENTER AND WALKING MIGHT BE YOUR -- THE DEVELOPMENT IS BIG ENOUGH THAT THAT MIGHT START TO GET A LITTLE BIT FAR SO JUST SIX CLASS C BIKE SPACES MAY NOT BE ENOUGH THERE. BUT MORE TO THE POINT, EACH OF THE MULTIFAMILY UNITS HAS FOUR CLASS C AND THREE CLASS A BIKE SPACES AND THAT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A LOT TO ME. SO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ROUGHLY WHAT 30 UNITS IN EACH OF THE -- YEAH. IN EACH OF YOUR NEW THREE STORY BUILDINGS, AND I IMAGINE THAT SOME OF THESE ARE BEAUTIFULLY PRICED FOR STUDENTS AND YOUNG PROFESSIONALS AND THEY DO LIKE TO BIKE AROUND AND THREE STORY ONE BEDROOM -- A THREE STORY BUILDING WITH A ONE BEDROOM UNIT YOU DON'T WANT TO STORE YOUR BIKE INSIDE. SO I'M WONDERING IF MORE BIKE PARKING CAN BE ADD AND WAS THAT DISCUSSED IN OBJECT AND NOBODY THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD IDEA AND IF SO I'M COMPLETELY HAPPY TO BE IGNORED. AND THAT IS ALL I WANTED TO SAYS.
00:32:40.898: >> SOUNDS LIKE THAT IS INVITING THE PETITIONER.
00:32:45.769: >> YEAH, I'M HAPPY TO SPEAK, GREAT TO HEAR THAT YOU WERE AL SWIM INNER A PAST LIFE. I DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S 25-YARDS. MAYBE TED COULD DO A DRAWING. MY GUESS IS IT'S PROBABLY LESS BECAUSE WE HAVE THE HOT TUB THERE BUT YEAH IT IS PROBABLY NOT 25-YARDS. WHERE WILL I THINK AT THE MEETING THERE WAS SOME CONFUSION WHEN THAT EXISTED. I ACTUALLY GREW UP WORKING AT MILL CREEK AS LANDSCAPER AND A UTE UTILITY GUY AND THAT PLAYGROUND HAND BEEN THERE FOR TEN YEARS AND AS YOMPINGED YOU MENACED THE PLAYGROUND IS OFF THE SCREEN HERE AND IT'S A BEAUTIFUL CITY INSTALLED WITH THE PROPER SAFETY MEASURES AND FOR US TO REPLICATE THAT SEEMS LIKE A WASTER OF RAIN RAIN RESOURCES. IN RESPONSE TO THE LAST POINT ABOUT IF BICYCLE PKI I THI IT A VER GOOD ON BAUSE I REWI YOU HA HIN BIKE ON THE THIRD FLOOR OF A ONE BEDROOM APARTMENT ISN'T NECESSILY PRACTICAL. I THINK WHAT WE'VE DONE AS MEET WHAT CODE HAS ALLOWED FOR BUT I THINK THAT THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES AS WE GET INTO THE PROJECT THAT IF THE DEMAND IS THERE THAT WE COULD ADD SOME AFTER THE PROJECT IS COMPLETED AND THE DEMAND IS THERE. SO IT'S A GREAT OBSERVATION AND I THINK THAT IT WOULD BE SOMETHING WE WOULD SHARE WITH OUR MANAGEMENT COMPANY TO KEEP AN EYE ON AND IF WE NEED MORE BIKE PARKING WE WOULD BE ABLE TO PUT IT INS.
00:34:44.688: >> OTHER QUESTIONS? OR COMMENTS FROM PLANNING COMMISSIONERS? COMMISSIONER CLARKE AND THEN COMMISSIONER WICHE.
00:35:03.006: >> IS THERE SPACE THAT WOULD WITH POSSIBLE TO BUILD THE BIKE PARKING? YOU IDENTIFY WHERE THAT WOULD BE?
00:35:15.952: >> I DON'T KNOW THAT WE HAVE ACTUALLY NECESSARILY TAKEN A LOOK THAT THE. IT'S THE FIRST TIME WE'RE HEARING IF COMMENT. I WOULD BE HAPPY TO AS WE CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD LOOK TO ADDRESS THAT BUT I BELIEVE WHO'S IN CONTROL, TED THE YOU WENT DOWN WITH YOUR CURSER I THINK THERE'S BIKE PARKING THAT COULD BE EXPANDED THERE. IT COULD ALSO BE EXPANDED. SO I THINK THERE ARE SOME NATURAL PLACES IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO WHERE IT IS GOING TO GO IN. WE COULD ALSO DO WHICH WE'VE DONE IN SOME OF OUR OTHER COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES WHERE WE BRING IN A TEMPORARY BIKE RACK IN THE SUMMERTIME. SO YOU MEET THE DEMAND IF IT'S THERE AND IF IT'S NOT THERE YOU TAKE IT AWAY AND WE'VE DONE THAT SUCCESSFULLY IN A UNDER THE NUMBER OF OUR COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES.
00:36:12.275: >> ANYTHING ELSE, THE COMMISSIONER CLARKE? EASTBOUND, COMMISSIONER WIFE.
00:36:18.048: >> AGAIN, BECAUSE I'M NEW, I.N'T INSIDE CONVERSATION IN OCTOBER. PARKING. I AM ALWAYS CONCERNED ABOUT MORE PARKING. A THIRD OF OUR LAND USE IN THE CITY IS FOR CAR STORAGE. SO I SEE THAT THIS ZONING ONLY CALLS FOR ONE AND A HALF UNITS WHICH WOULD ONLY REAL TAKE UP YOUR EXISTING REQUIREMENT FOR THE PROPOSED CHANGE, WOULD ONLY TAKE YOUR REQUIRED PARKING SPACES FROM 562 TO 574 OR AND A HALF. LET'S JUST CALL IT 575 BUT YOU'RE PROPOSE ANOTHER HURRICANE PARKING SPACES. DID YOU ALREADY DISCUSS THIS? HAVE WE TALKED ABOUT WHY 100 MORE PARKING SPACES ARE BEING INCLUDED IN THIS AND MAKING WAY FOR A PLAYGROUND THAT HASN'T BEEN THERE FOR TEN YEARS OREGON GET TO THAT 25-YARD SWIMMING POOL THAT COMMISSIONER DISCH WANTS?
00:37:17.741: >> IT WAS NOT SOMETHING WE DISCUSSED IN OCTOBER. I THINK THERE'S THE PRACTICALITY OF IN THIS LOCATION IT'S BEEN OUR EXPERIENCE THAT WE WOULD NEED AT LEAST ONE VEHICLE SPACE PER UNIT JUST BASED ON OUR RESIDENT BEHAVIOR. AND THE REST OF THE PROJECT ISN'T SET UP TO NECESSARILY ACCOMPLISH HAVING PEOPLE PARTNERING ELSEWHERE AND THEN BEING IN PROXIMITY SO IT REALLY COMES DOWN THE COMMERCIAL VIABILITY SO IN THIS INSTANCE I THINK WE'RE AGAIN TRYING THE DELIVER ADDITIONAL HOUSING UNIT ANDS WITH THAT DOES COME A DEGREE OF THINGS THAT WE AREN'T SUPPORTIVE OF WITH RESPECT TO PARKING BUT WE'VE KEPT IT TO ONE SPACE PER UNIT AND WE BELIEVE THAT THAT'S A PRETTY MINIMUM LEVEL OF PARKING TO INDUSTRIAL A COMMERCIALLY VIABLE PROJECT.
00:38:10.961: >> I MAY BE CONFUSE SO IF STAFF OR ANOTHER COMMISSIONER CAN GUIDE ME IN THIS. SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THERE ARE ALREADY 562 PARKING SPOTS IN THE DEVELOPMENT, IS THAT CORRECT?
00:38:25.108: >> RIGHT. AND I'LL JUST ADD TO WHAT MR. MARTIN SAID IN THAT JUST KIND OF A PRACTICALITY OF THE EXISTING LAYOUT SO WHAT I'VE DONE HERE IS HIGHLIED THE BUILDINGS ARE KIND OF SET UP IN THIS TYPICAL THREE BUILDING BLOCK SURROUNDING A FIELD OF PARKING. SO THE R THREE ZONING REQUIRES THE TWO PARKING SPACES PER UNIT SO WHEN YOU COMPARE THAT TO THE PROPOSED RESORBING IT'S OBVIOUSLY CLOSER TO THAT ONE AND A HALF THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED FOR THE WHOLE DEPUTY BUT IT'S KIND OF IMPRACTICAL TO HAVE THESE THREE OR FOUR -- I MEAN, THIS BUILDING UNUTILIZED EXISTING PARKING BUT THESE THREE BUILDINGS IT WOULD BE IMPRACTICAL TO HAVE THEM UTILIZE PARKING BEHIND OTHER BUILDINGS AND FOR THE NEW UNITS KEEPING THAT DOWN TO ONE SPACE PER UNION RATHER THAN THE ONE AND A HALF THAT'S REQUIRED.
00:39:37.180: >> WAS THAT A DESIGN CHOICE?
00:39:45.188: >> YES.
00:39:46.623: >> I HAVE MORE QUESTIONS BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW TO ASK THEM APPROPRIATELY.
00:39:54.664: >> GO AHEAD MR. LENART AND THEN THERE'S OTHER -- WE'LL COME BACK TO YOU COMMISSIONER WIFE.
00:40:06.910: >> THAT'S FINE. THANK YOU. I JUST WANTED TO FOLLOW UP ON THE QUESTIONS -- I THINK THIS IS RELEVANT TO OUR CONVERSATION ABOUT PARKING REQUIREMENTS BUT I THINK YOU'RE THERE BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S CLEAR. OUR ORDINANCE DOES SET A MINIMUM AND WE -- I WOULD SAY OTHER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS THERE'S BEEN NUMEROUS TYPES WHERE A PETITIONER HAS COME AND FOR MARKETING PURPOSES SAID I WANT TO PROVIDE MORE PARKING. AND I THINK THAT'S A POLICY DECISION AS TO WHAT -- WE'RE TAW ABOUT ELIMINATING THE MINIMUM SO AT A MINIMUM WE'RE NOT HAVING A HEAVY HAND TO DRIVE UP PARKING SPACES BUT THE OTHER PIECE OF THAT IS AT SOME POINT DO WE WANT TO START ESTABLISHING MINIMUMS FOR USES.
00:41:02.832: >>> I ALSO WANT -- COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL I SEE YOUR HAPPENED BUT WE HAVE A LOT OF COMMISSIONERS THAT WERE NOT HERE IN OCTOBER. TO LET YOU KNOW WHAT THE CONTEXT OF THAT MEETING WAS AND CORRECT ME STAFF IF I'M WRONG, IN SOME WAYS IT WAS SIMILAR TO WHAT WE HAD IF THE LAST WORKING SESSION, ALMOST LIKE A PRE-PETITION DISCUSSION, IT WAS INFORMAL BUT THE THEPETITIONER WAS ASKED -- COLD US WHAT THEY WERE INTERESTED IN. THE IDEA OF REZONING AND DOING SO WITHOUT HAVING TO REDO EFFECTIVELY ALL OF THE PARKING LOTS. THAT WAS THE CONTEXT OF THAT DISCUSSION SO WE DIDN'T HAVE ALL OF THE SPECIFICS AT THAT TIME BUT IT WAS GENERALLY DISCUSSING PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF WHAT -- AND YOU CAN CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG BUT WHAT THE COMPREHENSIVE LAND I DON'T SEE PLAN SAYS FOR THE TYPOLOGY IN THIS PARTICULAR PLACE TEMPERATURE TYPOLOGY OF HOUSING SO WERE THERE OTHER ELEMENTS OF THE PLAN THAT WERE -- THAT SUPPORTED EVEN IF THE TYPOLOGY WAS NOT AS INDICATED IN THE COMPREHENSIVE PLAN MR. LENART GO AHEAD.
00:42:40.864: >> IRENE THIS AND I APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING UP THE ZONING. THIS IS REFLECTED IN THE STAFF REPORT SO THE COMMISSIONERS HAVE SEEN THIS BUT THE FUTURE LAND USE MAP DESIGNATES IT AS ATTACHED SINGLE FAMILY. AND THERE WAS A DIFFERENT MULTIFAMILY FUTURE LAND USE ON THAT SAME MAP. AND THE DISCUSSION WAS WHAT ARE THOSE TWO LAND USES. I THINK THE ATTACHED SINGLE FAMILY WAS INTENDED TO BE REALLY SPECIFIC TO THE TOWNHOME MODEL WHICH THIS THE XI EXISTING EQUIPMENT REFLECTS. HOW ARE IT WOULD PROHIBIT STACKED FLATS, UNITS THAT ARE ON ONE LEVEL. SO I THINK THE PETITIONER WANTED TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION AT THE TIME RECOGNIZING THE THAT THAT'S A DEVIATION FROM THAT BUT FROM A PROGRAMMING PERSPECTIVE THEY'RE SIMILAR AND IT AFFORDED SOME ADDITIONAL HOUSING TEACHOLOGY IF IT WERE REZONED.
00:44:04.681: >> COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL.
00:44:05.982: >> A COUPLE OF THINGS. ONE IS THAT I THINK IN THE I THIS THAT ONE UNIT PER SPACE MAKES SENSE GIVEN THE PRACTICALITY OF THAT. I'M OKAY WITH THAT. I THINK I WOULD BE FRUSTRATED IF OUR 500 FEET AWAY BECAUSE OVERALL DEVELOPMENT MET THE GOAL AND YOU HAVE TO HIKE IT OVER TO WHERE YOU'RE GOING. SO FOR ME I'M OKAY WITH ONE PARKING SPECIFIER UNIT. I WOULD LIKE TO PUSH BACK ON THE BIKE PARKING. I WOULD LIKE YOU TO COMMIT TO MAKING MORE BIKE PARKING. I THINK IT WOULD MAKE SOUTHERN NEW ENGLAND TO HAVE MORE BIKE PARK. IT HAS IS OWN DIRECT CONNECTION OVER THE HIGHWAY SPECIFICALLY FOR PEDESTRIANS AND BIKERS TO GET TO OTHER PARTS OF TOWN. AND I'M NOT INTERESTED IN YOU SAYING MAYBE IT WILL HAPPEN. I THINK WHEN YOU'RE DOING THIS WORK IT'S MOBILIZATION AND ALL THESE THINGS.
00:45:16.252: >> WE'RE HAPPY TO DO THAT.
00:45:20.189: >> SO THAT'S WHERE I'M COMING FROM WITH THAT. SO BECAUSE I THINK IT'S EASIER TO DO IT ALL AT ONCE INSTEAD OF -- YOU JUST DO IT RATHER THAN GET BACK. I WOULD LIKE TO GET INTO THE WOODSES A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE STORM WATER. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S A CULVERT OR [INDISCERNIBLE]. IT JUST SEEMS LIKE CONDITIONS PLAN THAT THE KIND OF GENERAL SOILS MAPPING WHICH I UNDERSTAND IS GENERAL IS A SANDY SOIL. I NOTICE WHEN I WENT INTO YOUR ORM CALCULATION YOU HAD CLASS D SOILS WHICH IS AS BAD AS IT GETS AND I UNDERSTAND THERE'S LAYERS AND YOU LIKELY HIT SOME BAD SOIL AS YOU WENT DOWN. TO DO CAUSE AT HAS THESEREE YOU NOT NESRILY ON BOTTOM SYSTEMS INTERVIEW MAY NOT GO DOWN AS DEEP AS WT THESE THINGS ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO BE BECAUSE YOU'RE DOING IT EAR IN TH PROSS AND NOT LATER IN THE PROCESS. WOULD YOU CONSIDER IF AS YOU'RE DIGGING THIS THING YOU RUN INTO SEAMS TO BE ABLE THE IF YOU HIT A SAND SEAM THAT YOU WOULD CONSIDER HAVING AN OPEN BOTTOM SYSTEM. IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU GET RID OF THE THE DETENTION BUT THAT WOULD CONSIDER 1078 SORT OF BOTTOMLESS SYSTEM.
00:47:19.976: >> I, SO I HAVE TO GO BACK AND LOOK AT OUR INFILTRATION TESTING REPORT AND SEE HOW FAR WE WESTERN DOWN BUT YOU SAID IT'S TIME IT'S EARLY IN THE PROCESS BUT WE HAVE TO MAYBE A CONCERTED EFFORT TO UNDERSTAND WHERE THE BOTTOM OF THESE SYSTEMS WOULD BE AND THAT POTENTIAL LAYER FOR INFILTRATION AND THEN EVEN FURTHER THAN THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S A THREE-FOOT THICK LAYER OF THAT TYPE OF SOIL THAT HAS INFILTRATION CAPACITY. SO I DEFINITELY KNOW THAT WE HAD -- THE ELEVATIONS OF THOSE DETENTION SYSTEMS KIND OF WORKED THROUGH MORE OR LESS BEFORE WE DID THE TESTING AND DOWN TO THE DEPTHS THAT WE WERE ANTICIPATING TRYING THE BE ABLE TO INFILTRATE . EVEN BELOW IT WAS JUST ALL CLAY. THERE WAS A LOT OF FILL THAT WE GOT THROUGH BUT BELOW THAT WAS CLAY AGAIN, AND THEN IN THIS TO THAT WE HAVE OUR OUT LET TO EXISTING STORAGE SEWER ON BIRCH HOLLOW THAT WE HAVE TO WORK WITH WHATEVER DEPTH THAT'S AT TO HAVE AN OUTLET. SO AND HAVING SAID THAT THE DEPTHS THAT WE WENT DOWN TO JUST DIDN'T SUPPORT BEING ABLE TO INFILTRATE. THE ONLY WAY TO GET AROUND HAVING THAT OUTLET WOULD BE IF YOU WERE TO INFILTRATE YOUR ENTIRE STORM SYSTEM WHICH WOULD BE A VERY SENATE JUDICIARY PERMEABLE SOILS AND WE WERE RUNNING TO ALL CLAY SO WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY.
00:49:17.760: >> A & I'M NOT SAYING GET RID OF YOUR OUT LET. I'M JUST SAYING SOMETIME THINGS HAPPEN AND SHOULD YOU RUN INTO SAND BECAUSE WE DID THE WELL AND MITIGATION WORK IN THE PARK AND THERE'S ALL KITEDS OF KINDS OF LAYERS IN THERE AND IT WOULD BE GREAT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT OPPORTUNITY. TO CREATE AN OPEN BOTTOM SYSTEM IF THE SITUATION PRESENTS ITSELF. BUT I WANTED TO PUT THAT OUT THERE THAT THE MORE WE CAN PULL OUT NOW BECAUSE IT'S IN TERRIBLE SHAPE AND SUCH A BIG ISSUE FOR THE CITY. SO IF THE SITUATION PRESENTS ITSELF OBVIOUSLY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT BUT I WOULD SAY LOOK FINISH OPPORTUNITIES AS YOU'RE DOING THE DIGGING.
00:50:26.529: >>> YES AND I GUESS I'LL ADD ONE LAST THING. DID RUN INTO A LITTLE BIT HIGHER THAN. AND GROUND WATER ON THE SOUTH SIDE SO THESE ARE PRETTY SHALLOW SYSTEM TO TRY TO AVOID THAT SITUATION. SO YEAH WE'VE RUN INTO THOSE SITUATION WHERE WHERE YOU HAVE CLAY AND THEN YOU -- WE DID NOT HAVE YOU KNOWN INTO RUN INTO ANY OF THAT HERE.
00:51:01.764: >> JUST SAYING KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN FOR OPPORTUNITIES IS ALL I WOULD SAY INSTEAD OF BEING MARRIED TO THE CLOSED BOTTOM SYSTEM. IT WOULD BE GREAT IF THERE'S OPPORTUNITY TO PIVOT WITH THAT.
00:51:15.077: >> CERTAINLY.
00:51:15.878: >> ALL RIGHT. THANKS.
00:51:17.880: >> BEFORE WE MOVE ON I SEE COMMISSION ABRAMS' HAND AND THEN COMMISSIONER CLARKE'S HAND. COMMISSIONER GOING TO BE -- WERE YOU EXPECT HIM TO JOIN IN?
00:51:40.803: >> I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT MR. HIRSCH WAS THE ENGINEER.
00:51:43.806: >> I THINK MR. COBETTER'S NAME WAS ON THE SLIDE AND IMTO MAKE SURE THAT WE'VE GOT YOUR FULL TEAM.
00:51:55.685: >> LITTLE SECRET, TOM IS DOESN'T DUET RIGHT NOW. WE [SPEAKING SIMULTANEOUSLY.] (SPEAKING SIMULTANEOUSLY.)
00:52:19.975: >> COMMISSIONER ABRAMSS AND THEN COMMISSIONER CLARKE.
00:52:22.745: >> I COULDN'T REALLY HEAR ANYTHING BUT I WAS HAVING TO TURN IT SAW AND THEN I WAS GETTING LOST. AND I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY WOULD HEAR.
00:52:34.090: >> I WAS ABLE TO HEAR HER BUT -- OKAY. SO MAYBE SOMETHING WEIRD. AGAIN THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING NEW WHEN WE ARE ZOOMING. COMMISSIONER ABE BRICK AND MORTARS.
00:52:48.137: >> HI. WAS THERE A TRAFFIC STUDY DONE? I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING ABOUT THAT IN THE STAFF REPORT.
00:53:07.323: >> TED I'M PRETTY SURE WE DID ONE, RIGHT.
00:53:14.730: >> YES, THAT WAS ONE OF THE LAST THINGS UNDER REVIEW THAT -- WE'RE WAITING FOR FINAL COMMENTS ON. WE HAVE A COUPLE REVISIONS BUT THE BOTTOM LINE BEING THAT THERE'S NO SIGNIFICANT IMPACT TO PEDESTRIANS AND/OR VEHICLE TRAFFIC.
00:53:34.517: >> OKAY. MY OTHER QUESTION WAS ABOUT PEDESTRIAN CIRCULATION I JUST WONDERED I THINK I SAW IN THE PRESS OR THE SIDE PLAN A PLAN FOR A RAISED SIDEWALK THAT CROSSED NORTH SOUTH ACROSS BIRCH HOLLOW DRIVE. I WONDERED AND THEN OF COURSE THERE'S THE FILLING IN OF THE SIDEWALKS. I WONDERED ABOUT CROSSING TO THE EAST TO THE PARK AND WHAT THE PLAN WAS FOR THAT AND WHETHER THERE'S AN EXISTING CROSSWALK THERE.
00:54:14.723: >> YES, SIMILAR EXISTING CROSSWALKS AT THE CHELSEA CIRCLE INTERSECTION THAT LEADS TO THE PARK.
00:54:23.866: >> GREAT. THOSE ARE MY ONLY QUESTIONS FOR NOW.
00:54:30.473: >> COMMISSIONER WIFE.
00:54:37.179: >> I UNDERSTAND WE CANNOT DEMAND THIS BUT WE CAN ASK WHICH IS AS THE PETITIONER CONSIDER FOR THESE ADDITIONAL HUNDRED PARKING SPACES WHICH EXCEED THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENT, PUTTING IN SOLAR OR COVERINGS, PARKING COVERINGS THAT WOULD HAVE SOLAR TOPS TO HELP WITH THE I ELECTRIFICATION OR TO BE MOVED TOWARD THE CITY'S ZERO GUIDE SO WE HAVE TO HAVE THE PARKING, CAN WE MAKE THE PARKING DO SOMETHING PRODUCTIVE OTHER THAN JUST STORE THE CARS.
00:55:15.918: >> SO INSIDE NEW PARKING AREA WE ARE GOING TO MEETS THE ENVIRONMENTS FOR,V PARKING WITH THOSE DELIVERED AND THEN READY TO BE DELIVEREDDED AND THEN IN THE FUTURE AS THE CODE ALLOWS FOR WITH RESPECT TO ADDITIONAL SOLAR IT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER IN PRESENTATION THAT THE BUILDINGS HAVE A FLAT ROOF SO AT SOME POINT INSIDE FUTURE WE CAN POTENTIALLY ADD SOLAR THERE BUT WITH RESPECT TO SOLAR COVERINGS IN THE PARKING SPACES ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE IS KEEP COIN THE REALM OF FEASIBILITY AND IT WAS A SLIDE THAT TALKED ABOUT HOW THE MAJORITY OF OUR PROJECT IS AM.I. AND I THINK THAT OUR INTENT IS TO LIMIT THE COST IN THIS AREA TO TRY AND CONTINUE IN THAT VANE, SO WE HAVE NOT CONTEMPLATED SOLAR COVERING FOR THE PARKING SPACES AND MY GUT REACTION WOULD BE THAT IT WOULD DRIVE COST TO A PLACE WHERE THE FEASIBILITY OF THE PROJECT WOULD COME INTO QUESTION AND THAT'S UNFORTUNATELY THE REALITY OF COST THESE DAYS.
00:56:35.764: >> IF I MAY ADD TO THAT JUST FOR CLARIFICATION'S SAKE, I THINK IT WAS MENTIONS THE PARKING SPACES BUT IN EXCESS OF THE MINIMUM WHEN IT'S THE MINIMUM FOR THE INFILL PORTION OF THIS DEVELOPMENT, IT WOULD BE IN EXCEED EDGES IF THE ENTIRE DEVELOPMENT WAS DEVELOPED FOR TWO PARKING SPACES PER UNIT.
00:57:12.968: >> I'M AWARE OF THAT. I'M STILL HOLING MY POSITION THAT IT COMPETES EXCEEDS THE REQUIRED PARKING BASE ON THE WAY THE INFILL DEVELOPMENT O GOING, YOU'RE SORT OF ECING THAT OUT TO PROVIDE THE ADDITIONAL HUNDRED IN THE UNITS OF PARKING. THIS IS THE ONE OPPORTUNITY THAT WE GET TO SPEAKS BEFORE YOU DEVELOP THIS BECAUSE THEN IT IS WHAT IT IS FOR HOWEVER MANY YEARS. I THINK YOU SAID IT WAS FIRST DEVELOPED IN THE 70s SO WE'RE NOW SITTING AT 50 YEARS WITH THIS DEVELOPMENT AND THAT MEANS THAT WE MAY HAVE ANOTHER 50 YEARS WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF THIS FORWARD LOOKING POSITION ABOUT THE REDUCTION OF LAND USE FOR CAR STORM WARNING. STORAGE. SO I THINK YOU'VE ANSWERED MY QUESTION. IN BECAUSE THAT WAS SOMETHINGE THAT WAS ON MY LIST TOO. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I'M UNDERSTANDING THIS APPROPRIATELY BEFORE I MAKE MY COMMENT. SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S BEFORE US IS THE LANDSCAPE MODIFICATION AND THE LANDSCAPE MODIFICATION IS EFFECTIVELY TO NOT HAVE BRING ALL OF THE APARTMENT BUILDING -- A LOT OF IS ABOUT THE PART AND TO TEAR OUT THE PARKING TO BRING IT UP TO OUR MODERN STANDDS AND WE HAVE THEOW TORANT TT OR TO ROMMEND TO CITY COUNCIL BECAUS THE ULTATY WOULD BUT THAT'S WITHIOUR RLM IS EFFECTIVELY LAUNCHANDSCAPE ISLANDS ANIS THIS SHRUBBERY
00:59:06.448: >>T IS LANDSPE ISLANDED AND LANDSCAPING OF THE VEHICULAR AREAS BUT ALSO IT IS CONVERTED RAISED ISLANDS TO STORM WATER DETENTION DEVICE SOSES IT'S A LITTLE MORE INVOLVED THAN JUST PLANTINGS, IT ALSO INVOLVED INFRASTRUCTURE AND [INDISCERNIBLE]
00:59:31.840: >>> SO TO BE CLEAR OUR CURRENT STANDARDS EFFECTIVELY SAY THAT WHEN WATER HITS THIS SITE IT SHOULDN'T LEAVE RIGHT AWAY. IT NEEDSES TO BE TAKEN CARE BUT THAT WASN'T ALWAYS OUR STANDARD SO HAS ANY ANALYSIS BEEN DONE TO KNOW ABOUT WHETHER THE SITE AS A WHOLE IS UP TO THE STORM WATER STANDARDS? .
01:00:04.606: >> YEAH. THE SHORT ANSWER IS NO I'M SURE IT'S NOT.
01:00:10.679: >> SO IT'S WITHIN OUR CONTROL TO SAY DON'T RIP UP YOUR PARKING LOTS TO ALLOW FOR THAT INFILTRATION AND OF STORM WATER. THE THING THAT IS NOT WITHIN OR CONTROL BUT IF I'M READING THE STAFF REPORT APPROPRIATELY IS THAT WHEN WE ADDED THE,V SADS IN HERE WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT OUT AND IF THEY DON'T WANT TO -- EVEN IF WE SAY OKAY WE'RE GOING TO FOR BETTER OR WORSE LIKE GRANDFATHER YOUR EXISTING PARKING YOU STILL HAVE TO PROVIDE THE EV SPACE AND FOR THIS LAND USE TYPE THEY NEED TO HAVE SOME KIND OF INFRASTRUCTURE FOR EVERY VEHICLE SPACE ON THIS SITE. IS THAT FAIR? SO THIS IS WHERE MY -- WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONTROL AND I DON'T THINK THAT -- JUST FOR OTHER COMMISSIONERS' EDIFY OCCASION SOMETIMES WE HAVE A PLANNING COMMISSIONER THAT ALSO SITS ON THE ZONING BOARD OF I HAVE APPEALS WHICH IS THE BODY THAT IS QUASI JUDICIAL THAT DETERMINES WHETHER THERE'S A HARDSHIP. BUT BECAUSE IT'S ASSOCIATED WITH ZONING SOMETIME WE'VE KEPT SOME BENEFITS OF HAVING A COMMISSIONER SERVE ON BOTH. WE DIDN'T GET A VOLUNTEERS LAST TIME THERE WAS AN OPENING BUT I WOULD PLANT THAT -- PLACE WHERE I THINK THE DISCUSSION AROUND EVS WOULD BE HELPFUL BECAUSE WHAT MY RECOMMENDATION WOULD BE IS THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO BUILD PARKING HERE, KNOWING THAT YOU HAVE THAT VARIANCE, BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND THAT WHAT YOU'RE BUILDING YOU'RE GOING WITH THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE NEW THINGS BUT THERE'S A WHOLE BUNCH ON YOUR EXISTING THAT IF WE WERE -- WHAT THE ZONING CURRENTLY CALLS FOR IS FOR OPENNESS. THIS IS IN THE STAFF REPORT. 67 INSTALLED CHARGERS AND WE'RE GETTING 12 AND SO BUT YOU'RE BUILDING MORE THAN 67 PARKING SPOTS SO IN MY MIND THAT WOULD BE THE HAPPY MEDIUM TO MAX OUT WHAT YOU CAN. I DON'T HAVE CONTROL OVER THAT AND BECAUSE THAT'S NOT STANDARD THAT IS NOT BEFORE US BUT I LIKE COMMISSIONER WIFE I WANT TO BRING THAT YOU AS THAT MANY MY MIND IS SHOWING GOOD FAITH EFFORT TOWARD THAT AND IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU CONSIDERED.
01:03:13.161: >> I'M HAPPY TO TAKE THAT. I THINK THAT CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE SENTIMENTS AND KNOW THAT THAT'S THE WAY WE'RE GOING, AND AGAIN TRYING THE BALANCE THE CAR PRIORITY WITH THE KIND OF HUMAN HOUSING PRIORITY AND STILL END UP WITH A FINANCIALLY FEASIBLE PROJECT WHICH EVERYONE COMES BEFORE YOU AND SAYS THAT AND EVERYONE IS READING THE PAPER ABOUT COST SO WE'RE TRYING TO BE PRACTICAL. WHAT I WOULD COMMIT TO THIS GROUP IS WE HAVE TAKEN A DEEP DIVE INTO EXPANDING BEYOND THE BASS WHERE THIS INFILL AREA -- WE HAVEN'T CONTEMPLATED DOING ALL 67 SPACES BECAUSE IT WOULDN'T BE FINANCIALLY FEASIBLE BUT WE DON'T WANT TO GO TO THEM FOR A VARIANCE AND SAY WE WANT TO DO THE MINIMUM, WE DON'T TO GO TO THEM WITH AN ANALYSIS AND SAY THAT'S WHAT WE CAN DO AND BRING THAT TO THEM OF HEY WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE THE SPIRIT HERE AND MAKE ALL THESE THINGS WORKS BUT WE'RE DEFINITELY WILLING TO TAKE A LOOK AT BRINGING THEM A PLAN TO GOES BEYOND THE MINIMUM IN THIS INFILL AREA.
01:04:44.586: >> MR. LENART.
01:04:45.954: >> JUST FROM A PROCEDURAL PERSPECTIVE I WANT TO CLARIFY FOR THE PLANNING COMMISSION YOUR PROPOSED MOTION IS REFLECTIVE OF THE PLAN THAT THE PETITIONER IS PRESENTING HERE AND PART OF THAT IS PROPOSED,V PARKING. CONDITIONED UPON A VARIANCE BEING GRANTED BY THE ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS SOME I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT YOU COULD MODIFY THAT IF YOU DESIRED. YOU COULD SAY TO YOUR SUMMARY -- THE PLANNING COMMISSION COULD DETERMINE NO WE DON'T THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE THAT A VARIANCE BE GRANTED. THAT WE WOULD WANT THAT TO BE APPLIED ACROSS ALL THE SIDES. IT IS A RECOMMENDATION, THE ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS IS NOT BOUND BY YOUR RECOMMENDATION, THEY APPLY THEIR OWN STANDARDS TO A VARIANCE ASK SO IT MAY VERY WELL END UP BEING SOMETHING DIFFERENT BUT I WANT TO CLARIFY THAT WHEN YOU WERE SAYING YOU DON'T HAVE THAT AUTHORITY -- ESSENTIALLY YOU COULD SEND THAT MESSAGE AS PART OF ANY ACTION THAT YOU TAKE ABOUT EV PARKING, BEING COMPLIANT IN THIS AREA IN THE MATTER THAT YOU WISH TO ARTICULATE. IT IS A RECOMMENDATION BUT I WANT TO ADDS THAT IT'S MORE THAN A TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT IN THE CURRENT FORM IF THAT'S WHAT THE COMMISSION DESIRES.
01:06:17.979: >> OKAY, WELL THEN I WELCOME SOME ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS ON THAT. I HAVE TWO OTHER ISSUES IN THIS REALM BUT NOT IN PARKING, SO COMMISSIONER WIFE IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE AN IMMEDIATE FOLLOW UP.
01:06:40.535: >> CAN YOU E-MAIL MOTION TO US SO I CAN SEE THE WORDING OF IT AND IS SOMEONE FROM STAFF AVAILABLE TO HELP MODIFY THE MOST TO COME TOWARDS THE RECOMMENDATION THAT WAS JUST MADE THAT WE TIE THE 64 EV PARKING SPOTS TO THE VARIANCE SO THAT CAN BE CONSIDERED BY THE BODY?
01:07:07.195: >> I CAN WORKS ON THAT LANGUAGE AND PROVIDE IT.
01:07:13.201: >> MR. 11 NEWS, WEATHER AND TRAFFIC -- LENART IS GREAT AT HOPING TO DRAFT WHAT'S IN YOUR MEANWHILES. THE MOST IS AT THE TOP OF THE STAFF REPORT SO I ALWAYS READ FROM THE STAFF REPORT SO THAT'S WHERE YOU CAN FIND IT. COMMISSIONER DISCH IS YOURS ABOUT PARKING TOO? GO FOR IT THEN.
01:07:40.228: >> SIRE, I DIDN'T MEAN TO DISRUPT. I WANTED TO NOTE I VERY MUCH LIKE THIS IDEA OF ASKING -- RECOMMENDING GOING BEYOND THE MINIMUM WITH,V INSTALLED OR -- THE EV INSTALLED WOULD CLEARLY BE THE BEST PLACE TO GO BEYOND THE MINIMUM. SO I'M TRYING THE THINK. SO I'M LOOKING AT THE SITE PLAN AND MY GUESS IS THAT IT WOULD BE GREAT TO PROVIDE MORE EV INSTALLED PARKING BUT IT WOULD BE GREAT TO DO IT IN A WAY THAT WAS ACCESSIBLE AS POSSIBLE TO THE TOWNHOME PEOPLE. AND I KNOW THAT ANYTHING IS ACCESSIBLE BUT PEOPLE WANT TO COME HOME, PARK THEIR CAR AND CHARGE IT UP OVERNIGHT USUALLY AND I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY EV OWNERS YOU'RE GOING TO GET. I THINK YOU WOULD PROBABLY HAVE MORE IN THE TOWNHOMES IF ANY. AND SO I'M NOT ASKING TO RIP UP THE PARKING LOT AND FIX THEM BUT IF WE COULD THINK STRATEGICALLY ABOUT WHERE TO PLACE THESE SO THAT IT IT WOULDN'T SEEM LIKE TOO MUCH OF A DRIVE TO PARK YOUR EV BY SOMEONE ELSE'S APARTMENT AND WALK BACK TO YOUR TOWN HOW TOWNHOME THAT WOULD FANTASTIC, BECAUSE I'M PICTURING WHERE YOU WOULD PROVIDE EXTRA EV PARKING AND IT WOULDN'T SERVE THE PEOPLE IT COULD SERVE AND I'M NOT WANTING TO HAVE THAT HAPPEN. SO THAT'S BY WAY OF A COMMENT FROM PRACTICALITY.
01:09:37.779: >> AND I THINK THAT IS WELL SAID. I DON'T KNOW -- RIGHT NOW WE KNOW EV OWNERSHIP IS NOT -- NOT EVERYBODY IS GOING TO HAVE AN EV, SO IN MY MIND IT WOULD BE FINE IF THAT EV INFRASTRUCTURE WAS POSSIBLE TO ADD INTO SOME OF THE EXISTING APARTMENTS WITHOUT TOTALLY DIGGING THEM UP. BUT MY SINCE IS IF YOU'RE GOING TO BUILD IT -- AND I THINK THIS IS INCREASINGLY JUST SO YOU KNOW AND WE'RE NOT THERE YET. THAT'S NOT WHAT OUR ORDINANCE SAYS BUT I THINK THERE'S BEEN 1078 DISCUSSION ON PARKING THAT IF YOU BUILD IT IT SHOULD BE FUTURE PROOF WHICH MEANS EV READY AND HAS HAS BEEN A DISCUSSION AMONG THIS BODY, WE WANT TO NOT HAVE PEOPLE BUILD IT. SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO BUILD IT IT SHOULD COME WITH ALL OF THESE THINGS THAT ARE READY FOR THE FUTURE. COMMISSIONER MARTIN IS -- I ASSUME THAT YOU WANTED TO TALK ON THIS ISSUE. IS IT AND I'M OPEN TO THAT.
01:10:55.023: >> YEAH. AGAIN, I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION. WE DID TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT WOULD BE REQUIRED IF WE WERE TO BRING INTO THE ENTIRE AND THE COST OF THREE MILLION DOLLARS.CESS ONE OF THE ISSUES IS IS THAT PHE ELECTRICITYO WE PROBLY HAVE TGO OUT TO THE SEET AND HATE BRING I T EVEN HAVE THE CAPACITY WITHI THE COMMUNITY. THE REASON WE'RE ASKING FOR THE VARIANCE IS BECAUSE THE COMMUNITY IS NOT SET UP FOR IT AND THAT'S JUS A REALITY. IT WOU BE INCREDIBLY INVASIVE AND JUST GIVEN THE COST IF THAT'S THE WAY IT'S GOING TO GO I THINK THE,VS WILL HAVE ONE AND WE'LL PROBABLY MOVE ON FROM THE PROJECT BECAUSE WE CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY FOR IT. THAT'S JUST PRACTICALLY SPEAKING. WE'LL HAVE THE ABILITY TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS AND MEET THEM TO A CERTAIN DEGREE BUT OUR MAIN DIRECTIVE HERE WAS THAT HOUSING IS OF UTMOST NEED INSIDE CITY AND WE THOUGHT THIS WAS A GREAT INFILL LOCATION TO ACCOMPLISH THAT AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE AND RESOURCE AND THE COMMUNITY ASSETS LIKE THE PARK BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY WE'RE ALSO NOT TRYING TO RAISE PRICES ON EVERYONE $500 TO THEY HAVE A PLACE TO PLUG THEIR CAR IN WHICH WE DON'T EVEN HAVE AN HERBV IN THE COMMUNITY NOW. I APPRECIATE THE SENTIMENTS, WE'RE CERTAINLY WILLING TO HAVE A CONVERSATION THOUGHT ABOUT BUT IF WE HAVE TO GO OUT ACROSS THE COMMUNITY IT'S COST PROHIBITIVE SO I WOULD MOVE OFF THAT WE HAVE EXPLORED IT AND IT IS WHAT IT IS.
01:13:03.685: >> AND PULLING TOGETHER WHERE COMMISSIONER WIFE STARTED IS THERE'S ALMOST ENOUGH PARKING ALREADY HERE SO IF IT'S TO BE BUILT, MAKING SURE THAT IT'S FUTURE PROOFED BUT I RECOGNIZE THE STRUGGLES BUT AT THE SAME TIME OUR CLIMATE COMMITMENT IS SOMETHING WE DEAL WITH REGULARLY WHICH IS ONE OF THE REASONS WE'VE ENCOURAGEED NOT BUILDING PARKING. ECONOMIESER COMMISSION -- COMMISSIONER LEE.
01:13:50.798: >> JUST JUST AS A POINT OF INFORMATION I WAS JUST GOOGLING WHAT PERCENTAGE OF CARS ARE,V IN THE UNITED STATES. IT'S LESS THAN TWO PERCENT. THEY'RE PROJECTING IT TO BE 20 PERCENT BY 2035. BUT ALL THAT BEING SAID OBVIOUSLY EQUITY AND ACCESS WAS WHERE MY THOUGHT WAS SO COMMISSIONER DISCH BROUGHT THAT UP. AND I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE INFRASTRUCTURE DOESN'T NECESSARILY EXIST. TRYING THE GET THERE IS GOING TO BE DIFFERENT SO I THINK HAVING IT READY IS IMPORTANT. BUT I JUST WANT TO THINK FROM A PRACTICAL STANDPOINT OF UTELYATION OF HOW MANY CARS ARE GOING TO BE AT THE SIDE. REQUIRING 67 WHEN WE HAVE LESS THAN TWO PERCENT OF MARKET SHARE WITH 13 PERCENT -- THIS IS IN THE "NEW YORK TIMES." I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT OF ALL AT LEAST MY STANCE ON THIS IS I'M IN FAVOR OF INFILL. WE DO NEED MORE UNITS. SO HOWEVER WE CAN TRY TO BALANCE OUT EQUITY OR ACCESSIBLE WOULD BE GREAT. I DON'T HAVE A MAGIC BULLET FOR THAT BOOMEDDED TO SAY FROM A UTILIZATION STANDPOINT OUT OF 100 NEW SPOTS SAYING THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE 67 EV STATIONS I WANT TO BE REALISTIC, OBVIOUSLY CONSTRUCTION COSTS ARE PRETTY MUCH THROUGH THE ROOF BUT FROM THE STANDPOINT OF SIDEWALK CONTINUITY INFILL AND SUPPLY I WANT US TO HAVE SOME SENSE OF PERSPECTIVE IN TERMS OF UTILIZATION. BUT ALL THAT BEING SAID OBVIOUSLY I THINK ACCESS IS VERY CRITICAL SO I ACCEPTABLE DON'T WANT SOMEBODY LIVING HERE THAT HAS AN EV NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO CHARGE THEIR CAR. SO THAT'S WHAT I HAD THE SAY ON THE MATTER.
01:16:15.810: >> COMMISSIONER SAUVE.
01:16:18.980: >> I'LL LET THE PETITIONER SPEAK TO THAT IF THEY WANT TO.
01:16:28.189: >> END I WOULD BRIEFLY SAY WE ARE GOING TO HAVE EV STATIONS AT THE COMMUNITY CENTER AND THAT WOULD BE AN AREA WHERE WE WOULD FOCUS ON ADDING ADDITIONAL CHURCH CHARGERS WHERE THERE'S A MAJORITY OF PLUG-INS THAT AREA FOR ACCESS.
01:16:57.418: >> MR. HIRSCH?
01:16:57.785: >> I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY I THINK IF I'M HEARING THINGS CORRECTLY WE NEED TO MEET THE INTENT OF ACCESSIBILITY. BECAUSE WIDOW HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE PLANNED WHETHER IT'S INSTALLED, READY OR CAPABLE FOR ALL OF THE NEW PARKING SPACES BUT AGAIN STRATEGICALLY PLACING THEM, MAYBE THE INSTALL ED UNITS GO ALONG HERE SIMILAR TO INSTALLING SOME HERE ACCESSIBLE TO SOME EXISTING UNITS TO THE SOUTH AND STRATEGICALLY PLACING THOSE AS BEST WE CAN. THAT WAS MY ONLY COMMENT.
01:17:42.797: >> THANK YOU. COMMISSIONER SAUVE GO AHEAD THEN.
01:17:47.034: >> I ACTUALLY -- [INDISCERNIBLE] THE COMMUNITY CENTER AS THE CHARGING PORT. SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT BADGES AND I THINK A LOT OF THESE THINGS ARE REALLY ABOUT BALANCE. AND LOOKING AT THE PLANS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I HAD WAS ABOUT ACCESSIBILITY. THAT YOU ARE I KNOW THERE'S THREE BUILDINGS AND ONE STANDARD PLAN AND THEN THERE'S A 12 UNIT WHICH ARE ALL WALK-IN. WHAT THE PLAN TELLS ME IS THAT THERE NO ELEVATORS SO THERE'S ALREADY AN ECONOMY IN CONSTRUCTION AND TRYING TO FIND THE MARGIN OF MAKE THING PROJECT WORK. BUT NO ELEVATORS IS LIKE FINDING THAT BALANCE BUT IT DOES RAISE THE QUESTION AND FROM A TOPOGRAPHY STANDPOINT ARE ALL OF THE 30 UNIT BUILDINGS SPLIT LEVEL ENTRY OR DO ANY OF THEM HAVE GROUND FLOOR ACCESSIBLE OR IS IT ONLY THE 12 UNIT THAT HAS GROUND FLOOR ACCESSIBLE UNITS?
01:19:05.246: >> I WOULD PROBABLY HAVE HOBBIES AND BLACK ANSWER THAT QUESTION BUT I WOULD AL SAY THE COMMUNITY DOES GETTING INTO OUR POSSIBLY ABOUT DIVERSE HOUSING TYPE WE HAVE 57 OTHER ONE BEDROOMS SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY SO THERE'S A MYRIAD OF ACCESSIBLE UNITS IN THE REST OF THE UNIT, AND ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE DOING HERE IS WE ARE A BIT IMBALANCED WITH TWO BEDROOM SOSES THESE BUILDINGS WOULD HELP GET US THE DIVERSITY AND UNIT MIX FOR THE COMMUNITY.
01:19:43.050: >>> THAT'S HELP. YEAH IF THERE'S ANY TOPOGRAPHY EXPLANATION.
01:19:51.359: >> IT'S A PRETTY FLAT FROM WHAT I REMEMBER. THE FIRST FLOOR UNITS HAVE THE ABILITY TO BE ACCESSIBLE.
01:20:08.542: >> THE ELEVATIONSING LOOK LIKE THAT AND SO READING BETWEEN THE ELEVATIONS AND PLANS IT IS TRYING THE NEGOTIATE WHICH ONE WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT FOR EACH OF THOSE BECOMES BUT IT IS MY ROUND ABOUT WAY TO UNDERSTAND WHERE WE'RE PROBABLY AT A COST MARGIN WITH NO ELEVATORS AND TRYING TO MAKE SOME EFFICIENT SINGLE FAMILY OR SINGLE BEDROOM TO ADD TO THIS MIX, WHICH I REALLY SUPPORT.
01:20:37.271: >> IF YOU COME BACK AND DIG INTO THAT IT WOULD BE HELPFUL.
01:20:48.716: >> DID YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO OFFER ON THE ELEVATIONS? I THINK THAT WAS THE QUESTION.
01:20:53.821: >> SO AS FAR AS TOPOGRAPHY I I GUESS WHAT I WOULD SAY IS FOLLOWING THE SLOPE OF THE ROAD AND TYING INTO EXISTING GRADES THERE IS SOME FALL LONG THE LENGTH OF THE BUILDING BUT CREATED IN SUCH A WAY THAT THERE WOULD BE THE ACCESS AT EACH ONE OF THOSE GROUND LEVEL ENTRY POINTS.
01:21:24.919: >> COMMISSIONER LEE.
01:21:30.024: >> I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY RIGHT NOW WE ARE LOOKING TO APPROVE THE RESORBING FROM R THREE TO R FOUR B. AND THEN LIMIT LANDSCAPE MOVESES, IMPROVE LANDSCAPING SIMPLY BECAUSE IF YOU TRIGGER A HE HECK OF A LOT MORE SITE IMPROVEMENTINGS THROES FEASIBILITY OUT THE WINDOW. I'M GOING TO SWITCH FROM THE ELECTRICAL EV PARKING TO THE LANDSCAPING AND DETENTION. I'M NOT AN EXPERT IN DETENTION BUT I'M ONLY BRINGING IT UP BECAUSE I BELIEVE THIS YEAR MORE THAN I THINK EVER WE'VE HAD A LOT OF ISSUES WITH FIVE INCHES OF RAIN FALLING IN A SINGLE NIGHT SO CAN STAFF OR SOMEBODY ELSE SPEAK TO AS FAR AS LIQUID PLANNING FOR THE SITE WHETHER THE CURRENT STANDARDS ARE NOT NECESSARY FROM THAT LANDSCAPE MODIFICATION PERSPECTIVE? I'M I'M NOT SURE -- I DON'T KNOW HOW TO PHRASE THE QUESTION BUT I'M BIBLY SAYING I'M NOT AN EXPERT IN WATER RUNOFF. DO WE HAVE ANY CONCERNS FROM THE DETENTION PERSPECTIVE OF MAKING SURE THAT THIS SITE WON'T ADVERSELY I IMPACT OVERALL WATER CONTROL IS? SO THAT'S KIND OF A GENERAL QUESTION THAT I HAVE. AGAIN, I'M THINKING OF 94 BEING FLOOD. SOUTH MICHIGAN AVENUE DRAINAGE QUESTIONS ON A MORE MACRO SCALE. DOES MY QUESTION MAYBE SENSE?
01:23:15.029: >> IT DOES. GO AHEAD MR. HIRSCH.
01:23:20.501: >> SO I WOULD RESPOND TO THAT IN EXPLAINING THE MODIFICATION IS ESSENTIALLY -- SO PER CODE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF THESE LANDSCAPE ISLANDS HAVE TO BE DEPRESSED AND ACCEPT WATER. WATER HAS TOLOW INTO THEM A SO AGAINOI BACK TOHE.PT EXTI LOU WE DO HAVEHESE EXISTINGANDSCAPE ISLAN BUT CH A WAY AS TO DIRT WATER OR DRAINAGE TO ANY O THESE OF ISNDS. SO TO EFFECTIVELY ADD THAT STUFF WOULD BE -- AS OTHERWISE HAVE ALLUDED TO RIPPING UP THE PARKING AND REDESIGNING THAT. AND BEYOND THAT WE ONLY DO THE INFILTRATION TESTING IN THE INFILL AREAS BUT WE DO KNOW EVERY MORNING IN THE AREAS WE'VE TESTED IS A LOT OF CLAY SO REALLY I WOULDN'T EXPECT TO HAVE REALLY A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR INFILTRATION IN LANDSCAPE ISLANDS IF THAT WERE TO BE REQUIRED.
01:24:38.112: >> GOTCHA BUT THAT'S ACTUALLY REALLY HELPFUL THERE A LAYMAN'S PERSPECTIVE SO I APPRECIATE THAT. THAT'S PRETTY MUCH THE EXTENT OF MY QUESTIONS. OVERALL I DO SUPPORT THIS BUT AS I SAID SIDEWALK CONTINUE NEWTY IS IS A GOOD THING AND MAKING THESE EV READY IS DOING A GOOD JOB OF BALANCING A MYRIAD OF FACTORS SO THANK YOU FOR THAT EXPLANATION ON THE WATER RUNOFF.
01:25:22.222: >> COMMISSIONER LEE'S QUESTION RAISEs A QUESTION I HIGH TEMPERATURE THOUGHT HADN'T THOUGHT AUTOMATIC BEFORE. SO SOME OF WHAT'S BEING DEVELOPED HERE WAS GREEN SPACE PREVIOUSLY. I THINK THE ARGUMENTS ABOUT MARY BETH DEFENSIVELY PROVIDING THE FUNCTIONALITY FOR INFILL DEVELOPMENT. BUT THE QUESTION IS WAS THIS GREEN SPACE WE RELIED ON FOR STORM WATER MANAGEMENT OF THE THE EXISTING DEVELOPMENT AND IS THAT CALCULATING INTO THE SIZING OF YOUR STORM WATER FOR THIS SITE? PRESUMABLY IF YOU'RE RUNNING OFF FROM THE PARKING LOTS OR WHATEVER NOW, I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE DESIGNING THAT FOR THIS AS WELL.
01:26:16.744: >> SO THE EXISTING GREEN SPACE WASN'T CONSTRUCTED IN SUCH A WAY TO HOLD WATER AT ALL. IT WAS SHIELD FLOWING ACROSS THIS INTO THE STREET SO THEN SAN FRANCISCO AND ACTUALLY WHAT PART OF THE DETENTION SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO DO IS ACCOMMODATE -- SO THESE BUILDINGS TO THE SOUTH HERE HAVE ROOF ASKS DOWNSPOUTS THAT DISCHARGE AT GRADE SO ESSENTIALLY HALF OF THESE BUILDINGS THAT WILL ACTUALLY CONTRIBUTE TO THE EXISTING SYSTEMS AND THOSE ARE DINED DESIGNED TO THAN VOLUME.
01:26:57.785: >> SO YOU'RE SPEAK ABOUT THE NEW IMPERVIOUSNESS PLUS OF THE EXISTING AND BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT NOT GREAT SOILS EVEN THOUGH IT'S GREEN IT'S NOT EXACTLY DOING THE ABSORPTION THAT PEOPLE IMAGINE. IS THAT FAIR?
01:27:17.504: >> YEAH, SO THESE SYSTEMS ARE DESIGNED TO ACCEPT ANYTHING THAT'S FLOWING TOWARDS THEM IN THE POST DEVELOPMENT CONDITION.
01:27:26.814: >> GOT IT. OKAY, THANKS, THAT HELPS ME GIVE ME SOME COMFORT ON THAT. I WANTED TO ALSO -- SO ON CIRCUMSTANCE BACK TO THE DISCUSSION ON EVS I THINK I WOULD LIKE THE SEND THE MESSAGE TO ZBA MORE THAN WHAT IS SHOWN. I'LL VOICE THAT AND LET OTHERWISE DUKE OUT THAT WHAT SHOULD BE. ON BICYCLE PARKING I ALSO HEARD A COMMITMENT FROM THE DEVELOPER THAT YEAH WE CAN ADD MORE BUT I THINK THAT WE AUDIT TO BE DRAFTING THAT INTO OUR APPROVAL LANGUAGE IN TERMS OF NUMBERS OR WHERE THAT IS AND I WOULD VOICE THAT WHAT IS MISSIONING MISSING HERE IS CLASS B PARKING BY THE ENTRY WAYS BECAUSE AS A RENTER SOME PEOPLE WILL WANT IT CLASS A, INSIDE LOCKED. THE SPACES THAT YOU HAVE RIGHT NOW CLASS C ARE GREAT FOR GUESTS BUT CLASS B, COVERED BY AN ENTRY DOOR IS WHERE IF I LIVED HERE WHERE I WOULD WANT TO PARK MY BIKE, AND SO THAT'S -- I THINK UPPING THAT WOULD BE GREAT. AND ALSO I HAVE A QUESTION FOR STAFF AND MAYBE THIS WAS JUST A TYPO BUT IT'S SUGGESTED IN THE STAFF REPORT THAT THERE'S ALREADY 224 EXISTING CLASS A SPACES AND 224 EXISTING CLASS C SPACES AND THAT WAS NOT MY PERCEPTION HAVING -- ADMITTEDLY IT WAS QUICK AND A YEAR AGO, CYCLED THROUGH THIS NEIGHBORHOOD MYSELF. I DIDN'T SEE A PLACE WHERE THERE WAS A BUNCH OF BICYCLE INFRASTRUCTURE. SO DO YOU KNOW EITHER FOR THE -- MS. THATCHER I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU PUT TOT THE STAFF REPORT BUT EVEN THE ADOPT TEAM WHERE THE EXISTING BICYCLE STRUCTURE IS.
01:29:34.408: >> I'VE AFRAID I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE FLOW PLANS TO THE OTHER UNITS SO IT WOULD BE GREAT IF THE DEVELOPER COULD FACT COLLECT THAT FOR US.
01:29:45.719: >> YES, SO THE NUMBER WAS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF EXISTING BASEMENTS AND ALL OF THE EXISTING UNITS AND CONSIDERING THOSE AS POTENTIAL LOCATIONS FOR STORING SOMEONE'S BIKE.
01:30:08.675: >> IS THAT WHAT WE NORMALLY -- IS THAT OUR NORMAL PROCEDURE, STAFF? I'M JUST CURIOUS.
01:30:17.651: >> WE DO. WE SPECIFY INDOOR STORAGE. SOMETIMES IT IS ACCOMMODATED IN A BIKE ROOM AND OTHER TIMES THEY HAVE ACCOMPLISHED THAT BY PROVIDING GARAGE OR INTERIOR SPACE SO IT CAN MEET THAT. IF IT'S AN INDOOR STORAGE SPACE AVAILABLE TO THAT UNIT IT WOULD BE A CLASS A.
01:30:42.242: >> OKAY, AND THEN I MEAN, THIS IS -- I'VE SEEN THIS IN OTHER PLACES AND I DON'T KNOW THAT THE RESIDENTS KNOW THAT'S BICYCLE INFRASTRUCTURE. SO BUT THE 224 CLASS C, ARE THERE THAT MANY BIKE COOPS THROUGHOUT THE EXISTING DEVELOPMENT?
01:31:07.334: >> I THINK IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE TYPO -- I'M NOT LOOKING THE REPORT BUT THE 224 EXISTING BASEMENTS -- IT JUST SAYS WE WERE CONSIDERING THE REQUIRED NUMBER OF CLASS A AND C PROVIDED WITHIN THOSE BASEMENTS.
01:31:36.396: >> GOT IT. IN MY MIND, CLASS C AT THE SWIMMING POOL. THE COMMUNITY BUILDINGS IS IMPORTANT. ADDITIONAL CLASS B, WHERE YOU ARE DOING YOUR DEVELOPMENT IS REALLY IMPORTANT. I WOULD AT MINIMUM WANT TO SEE IF WHAT YOU'RE REQUIRED TO HAVE IS 77 SPACES I WOULD WANT TO SEE 77 NEW SPACES IN WHAT YOU'RE BUILDING, WHICH DOESN'T -- I THINK THAT COLLECTIVELY ACROSS THE SPACE IN PUBLIC SPACES AND ALSO SOMETHING THAT IS COVERED, SEEMS LIKE IT WOULD BE ABOUT RIGHT. I'M WEIGHING IN BUT COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL YOU BROUGHT THIS UP BEFORE SO I WELCOME YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT. SO THAT WAS POINT NUMBER TWO AND POINT NUMBER THREE IS IN THE DISCUSSION WITH OR THE MEETING THAT YOU HAD WITH NEIGHBORS THERE WAS SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT EXISTING COVENANTS AND IS THIS REZONING ALLOWED WITHIN COVENANTS AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT THAT WAS ALL ABOUT BUT ONE OF THE THINGS I NOTICED IS THE SHAPE OF YOUR PARCEL IS WEIRD AND HONESTLY IN DISCUSSION TONIGHT AT THE DINNER TABLE MY HUSBAND NOTED THAT THERE'S A CITY PARK THAT HE COULDN'T FIND A SIGN FOR AND THERE IS -- IT'S MILL CREEK PARK. BUT IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S PART OF YOUR PROPERTY SO THIS IS A QUESTION FOR STAFF OR FOR YOU ALL. LINING, IS THAT CITY PARK LAND IS THERE AROUND EASEMENT AND I'M CURIOUS ABOUT HOW REZONING THIS AFFECTS THE -- MY READING BETWEEN THE LINES AND PULLING THESE THINGS TOGETHER IS THE DISCUSSION ABOUT THE COVENANT IS WHAT AGREEMENTS WERE MADE INSIDE INITIAL DEVELOPMENT THAT ARE OUR REZONING WOULD OTHER RIDE AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE AWARE OF THOSE THING. SO MR. LEONARD I'M --
01:33:44.891: >> SO THIS QUESTION IS A QUESTION THAT HAS BEEN RAISEs AND I WELCOME -- I ASSUME THE PETITIONER HAS BEEN PART OF THIS TOO. LEO IS OUT OF THE OFFICE SO JILL AND I ARE DOWN OUR BEST BUT WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS JUST LIKE YOU OBSERVED OR SOME MEMBER AT THE DINNER TABLE OBSERVED THIS SHOWS UP IN MANY DOCUMENTS AS A PARK, HOWEVER TO MY KNOWLEDGE WE HAVE NOT YET FOUND ANY END OCCASION THAT IT HAS BEEN IF I BELIEVELY DEDICATED AS A PARKS. AS FAR AS IF ORIGINAL ZONING MY RECOLLECTION IS THAT THIS WAS PLANNING CONSTRUCTED PRIOR TO BEING AN NECKED INTO THE CITY. I'M NOT POSITIVE ABOUT THAT BUT SO I THINK THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE WERE INVESTIGATING. I DON'T KNOW IF MR. MARTIN HAS ANY FOLLOW-UP INFORMATION ON THAT BUT WE WERE TRYING TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION. BUT DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER NOW.
01:34:50.657: >> I BELIEVE THAT IT'S BEEN PASS DOWN TO ME AND AGAIN THIS WAS BUILT -- I THINK I WAS NOT EVEN ALIVE YET BUT IT'S BEEN TOLD TO ME THAT ALL THE NEGOTIATIONS FOR DONE WITH THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR SO IT'S PROBABLY BEEN LOST WITH TIME BUT AROUND HERE THE DEVELOPMENT WAS APPROVED BY THE CITY. I BELIEVE IT WAS PART OF THE CITY SO MAYBE IT CAME IN DURING THE APPROVAL.
01:35:25.458: >> DO YOU KNOW THE STATUS OF THE PARK?
01:35:26.393: >> ALL I KNOW IS A GENTLEMAN IN MISAVERS AND ALEXIS WERE TALKING ABOUT THAT AND THERE WAS NOT REALLY A CONCLUSION OR CONCRETE DIRECTION ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. PRESUMABLY IT'S BEEN PART OF OUR SURVEY, PART OF OUR LEGAL DESCRIPTION AND PART OF OUR TAX BILL FOR ALL THESE YEARS SO IT'S JUST AGAIN I THINK ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT WE DON'T HAVE CLARITY ON. AND AS COMMISSIONER MILLS POINTS OUT IT'S VERY -- IT'S MAYBE A TEN FEET WIDE -- IT IS A VERY NARROW STRIP, ODD SHAPED AND BASILLY IS A LITTLE B O GREEN ACE BUFFER BETWEEN TWO SOMEBODY ULIZINGSAID PARE THEYOU PBAYIGRATE TO MARY BOIL SO IT'S KIND OF A MYSTERY. IT'S LISTED AT A 9.5 ACRE PARK BECAUSE THIS WAS A POINT OF DISCUSSION AND THE PETITIONER MAY NOT KNOW AND MAYBE NOT ALL PLANNING COMMISSIONERS IT WAS OUR COVID PROJECT TO GO TO EVERY PARK AND TAKE A PICTURE OF A SIGN AND THE DISCUSSION WAS THERE WAS NO SIGN. BUT ALSO THE RAIN SHOWER THAT REASON I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO SORT OUT IS UNIT DENSITY IS BASE ON THE OVERALL SIZE SO UNDERSTANDING THAT IS MERCHANT WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO THINK ABOUT ALLOWABLE UNITS BECAUSE AGAIN WHEN WE'RE TALKING DEVELOPMENT ON JUST THE PORTION P WHAT IS BEFORE US IS REZONING THE ENTIRE -- ALL OF THE ACREAGE , SO THAT WAS PART OF IT. BUT ALSO MAYBE THIS IS FOR THE PETITIONER TOO, IN THE CITIZEN -- THE MEETING WITH CITIZENS THERE WAS A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT COVENANTS OR PREVIOUS THINGS. CAN YOU SHED ANY LIGHT ON WHAT THAT'S ALL ABOUT?
01:37:45.065: >> AGAIN, WE DON'T HAVE ANY RECORDS OF ANY COVENANTS. I THINK THAT SIMPLY PUT IT WAS NEIGHBORS THAT ONLIED TO THE POTENTIAL PROJECT AND HAD CREATED THAT MESSAGING. BUT THERE'S NO RECORD OF ANY COVENANTS IN MY TITLE WORK OR ANYTHING WE FOUND THAT TALKS ABOUT THAT SPACE. SO AGAIN I THINK THAT HAVE SOMETHING THAT WAS THROWN OUT THERE BUT THERE'S IN EVIDENCE OF A COVENANT.
01:38:22.502: >> OKAY. OVERALL I WELCOME IDEAS ABOUT THE RIGHT AMENDMENT RELATED TO BICYCLE PARKING AND THE RIGHT 8 RECOMMENDED TO EV INFRASTRUCTURE ON ANY PARKING THAT IS BUILT HERE. OTHER ALL AS I SAID BEFORE THIS OCTOBER I LIKE THE IDEA OF INFILL. AND I MEAN, ONE OF THE REASONS FOR INFILL IS TO USE THE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S AROUND THERE AND THIS IS AMONG THE REASONS WHY I'M PUSHING WIFE ON THE PARKING. I UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE WANT TO HAVE SOMETHING BY THEIR UNIT AND IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE BUILDING A BAZILLION PACES BUT ALSO THINKING ABOUT FUTURE PROOF THING. BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THIS INFRASTRUCTURE WITH ANY HOPE WILL LAST DECADES. AND THERE'S LOTS OF CHANGES THAT WILL HAPPEN TO THE WAY THAT PEOPLE GET AROUND IN THAT TIME THAT HAVE TO HAPPEN. AND SO MAKING SURE THAT IT'S RESILIENT TO THAT IS IMPORTANT. COMMISSIONER ABRAMSS AND MR. LENART. I'M SORRY, COMMISSIONER LENART FIRST.
01:39:46.085: >> I JUST FORGOT TO LOWER MY HAND.
01:39:48.454: >> OKAY, THEN COMMISSIONER ABE RAPS.
01:39:52.492: >> I ALSO GENERAL SUPPORTS THE PROJECT: AS I THINK WE ALL TALK ABOUT IN MEETING WE NEED MORE HOUSING BUILT AND THIS PROJECT DEFINITELY CHIEFS THAT AND IT INCREASES THE DENSITY ON THE SITE WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT ALLOWS US TO BUILT MORE UNITS. AND I THINK THE OTHER THING WE TALK ABOUT IS THE SUSTAINABILITY AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO MEET OUR GOALS BY 2030 AND THIS ISN'T SOMETHING WE CAN MANDATE BUT TALK TO PETITIONERS ABOUT MAKING THE PROJECT MORE SUSTAINABLE, IN PARTICULAR AROUND I'M THINKING HERE IN PARTICULAR AROUND FOSSIL FUEL ENERGY. SO TWO THINGS I'M WON KERRING DEEING ABOUT, ONE IS IF YOU'VE LOOKED INTO ELECTRIFICATION. I THINK WE'RE HEARING THAT IT'S POSSIBLE MAYBE NOT NO COST BUT LOW COST AND LOWER COST I THINK IT'S GETTING CHICKENNER AND CHEAPER SO I THINK IT'S SOMETHING WE'RE LOOKING INTO IF WE'RE THINKING ABOUT FUTURE PROOFING THIS WOULD BE ANOTHER ASPECT TO HAVE THAT. SO HAVING THE NEW BUILDINGS NOT BE DEPENDENT ON FOSSIL FUEL ENERGY, SO ELECTRIC APPLIANCES AND ELECTRIC HVAC. AND THE OTHER OF COURSE IS SOLAR PANELS. SO THIS ISN'T NEWS TO ANYBODY BUT IN 25ISH PERCENT OF LOW CARBON EMISSIONS HAVE DUE TO RESIDENTIAL USE AND THERE'S SOME SUB SET OF THAT WHICH IS BIG IN ANN ARBOR WHICH IS RENTERS WHO DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO PURSUE SOLAR ON THEIR PROJECTS. I THINK SOMEBODY ELSE MIGHT CORRECT ME ON THAT. IT'S UPWARD OF 50 PERCENT OF OUR COMMUNITY ARE RENTERS SO I THINK ANYTIME THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE BUILDING MULTIUNIT DEVELOPMENTS IT'S A GOAL. SO I FLOSS A COST AND THAT MAY OR MAY NOT WORK BUT I HOPE YOU'RE LOOKING INTO IT AND CONSIDERING IT AND THINKING ABOUT HOW LONGER TERM OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE COSTS FOR THE PROJECT AND LONG-TERM INVESTMENT. SO THOSE ARE THINGS WE CAN'T MANDATE BUT I THINK WE'RE OBLIGED TO ASK OF THE PEOPLE WHO COME BEFORE US AND SHOW US NEW CONSTRUCTION. THANKS.
01:42:19.605: >> COMMISSIONER LEE?
01:42:23.676: >> I'LL MAKE THIS BRIEF. I'LL ECHO THE ELECTRIFICATION. I SUE THE NEW LIGHTING IS LED SO BECAUSE THIS IS A CAPITAL EVENT IF THE EXISTING SITE LIGHTS COULD BE RETROFIT WOULD BE REALLY SOMETHING THAT'S GREAT. AND THEN JUST GET BACK TO BIKE PARK THIS SIDE DOES HAVE A HIGH SCHOOL. I'VE ACTUALLY BIKED THERE TO PLAY DISK GOLF SO I DEFINITELY KNOW IT'S BIKABLE. IT'S FAIRLY FLAT AND IT'S A VIABLE MODE OF TRANSPORTATION. SO I ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO ENCOURAGING THAT. SO LED LIGHTING AND LOOKING AT THE OVERALL SITE. AND THIN ALSO JUST LOOKING AT BIKE PARKING AND ELECTRIFICATION AND THAT'S CONTRIBUTING TO THE OVERALL GOALS. THAT'S IT. THANKS.
01:43:27.673: >> I'M NOT SEEING DIGITAL OR REAL HANDS UP. WHAT I'M WONDERINGS, IF TWO HANGING ISSUES ON BIKES AND PARKING PARKING LOTS. MR. LENART HAVE YOU DRAFTED LANGUAGE THAT WE CAN THROW OUT AS AN AMENDMENT?
01:43:55.168: >> I DID WHAT COMMISSION I WIFE SAID HIS IT'S PROSED CHANGE WOULD MODIFY THE MOTION REGARDING CONDITION UPON VARIANTS, AND THE WAY I STRUCTURED IT THIS OBVIOUSLY COULD BE MODIFIED BUT THE WAY I STRUCTURED THE PROPOSED LANGUAGE TO COMMISSIONER WIFE WOULD BE THAT CONDITION UPON A VARIANCE BEING GRANTED FOR EV PARKING NOT TO EXCEED 37 EVI SPACES OR 118,VR SPACES WHAT TIME THAT WOULD HAVE THE IMPACT OF RESULTING IN IS THAT YOUR RECOMMENDATION WOULD BASICALLY BE SAYING HEY A RANGE VARIANCE -- AT THE END OF THE DAY THIS SITE SHOULD PROVIDE 30 EV INSTALLED SPACES AND 50 EV READY SPACES AND IT DOESN'T SPECIFY ANY MINIMUM STANDARD OF,VC SO THAT WOULD EITHER BE COMPLIED WITH OR GRANT BY A ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS. SO IT'S MODIFIABLE BUT I STRUCTURED IT IN A WAY THAT IT WOULD GIVE THE ABILITY TO CONSIDER A MEDIUM.
01:45:18.651: >> COMMISSIONER WIFE.
01:45:20.853: >> AND I SENT AN E-MAIL TO MS. THATCHER BUT MR. LEONARD -- BECAUSE I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THEY STRUCTURE UNDERSTOOD THE VARIANCE IS THAT DO NOT COMPLY WITH THE ZONING REQUIREMENT WHICH WOULD BE MUCH HIGHER THAN WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT. SO WHEN I LOOK AT BOTH THE STAFF REPORT AND I LOOK AT THE SIDE PLAN THEY ARE -- BOTH OF THOSE DOCUMENTS ARE CALLING FOR -- WELL, REQUIRED AND PERMITTED IS NOT DISTINGUISHED SO I WILL START BY SAYING THAT. IS IT'S NOT SAME COLUMN. SO IT WAS 65 OF PERCENT OF THE PARKING B BE TAKABLE WHICH WOULD BE 436, 25,V READY WHICH WOULD BE 1608 AND EV INSTALLED WHICH WOULD BE 67. SO BY STATUTE IF THEY ARE MOVING FROM THE ZONING THAT THEY'RE IN TO R FOUR B WOULD THEY HAVE TO MEET THOSE REQUIREMENTS SO THAT WAS THE QUESTION THAT I SENT SO I CAN PROPERLY UNDERSTOOD THE REVISED MOTION. THAT CAN JUST BE REALLY SIMPLE AND THIS REALLY ISN'T WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR BUT I'M HAPPY TO GO ALONG WITH THIS BECAUSE WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IS MORE HOUSING LESS PARKING AND SOLAR BUT THOSE AREN'T THINGS WE CAN REQUIRE AT THIS TIME.
01:46:55.815: >> MR. LENART THE QUESTION ABOUT WHAT I HEARD WAS I'M GOING TO REPHRASE COMMISSIONER WIFE, IS THE MULTIPLIERS THAT ARE IN THERE THAT'S ABOUT MAKING ANY MODIFICATION IT'S NOT SPECIFICALLY ABOUT ZONEING?
01:47:18.537: >> SO NO. I THINK THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION AND I APOLOGIZE, I'M TRYING TO DO THE MATH. I'M NOT SURE OUR STAFF REPORT IS CORRECT BUT LET ME JUST -- I JUST WANTED TO SORT OF TALK THROUGH IT. SO AT 383 UNITS UNDER THE R FOUR B, THAT WOULD BE 1.5 SPACES AS REQUIRED TIMES THE NUMBER OF UNITS. SO.
01:47:52.672: >> THAT'S LIKE 575.
01:47:55.307: >> SO IT WOULD BE 57 WOULD BE REQUIRED SO I THINK THE CALL CLAYSES THAT WERE DONE ON THE NUMBER OF SPACES PROPOSED, NOT THE MINIMUM REQUIRED AND THE NUMBER OF EV PARKING APPLIESES TO MINIMUM REQUIRE SOD THIS THEY THEY WANT TO CHOOSE AN ADDITIONAL 100 PACES THOSE DON'T HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THE EV PARKING REQUIREMENTS. SO THE MINIMUM TO COMPLY WOULD BE 57 AND I CAN DO THE MATH HERE SHORTLY. SO JUST  BE CLEAR IF A COUPLE OF OPTIONS IN THIS REGARD. A SITE PLAN DOE'TEET THAT REQUIREMENT YOU ULD SIMPLY FIND THAT BASED ON THATOU DOT RECOMMEND AROVAL. TELEGRAPHING THAT THEY INTEND TO APPLY FOR A VARIANCE TO THE NING BOARD OF APPEAL TO SECRET I WOULD JUST ADD FROM A -- THIS IS A CONVERSATION THAT WE STARTED HAVING AND I THINK I SHARED IT DURING THE PLANNING COMMISSION, I DO THINK THAT -- THAT IS OUR STANDARD, THAT IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH THE ORDINANCE WITHOUT A VARIANCE, THE ENTIRETY OF THOUGH SPACES WOULD NEED TO BE PROVIDED. I DO BELIEVE THAT OUR INTENTION AS PART OF THAT ORDINANCE WAS TO FUTURE PARTS WHEN THEY'RE BEING DEVELOPED AND SIGNIFICANTLY MOST MODIFIED FOR THAT PURPOSE OF GROWING OUR INFRASTRUCTURE TO ACCOMMODATE THE TRENDS IN EV HAVE VEHICLE ASKS AS RECENTLY EVIDENCED BY ANOTHER VARIANCE GRANTED BY THE ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS I THINK THE WAY THAT THAT IS CURRENTLY SPECIFIED THAT IT IS ANY SIDE PLAN FINISH CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL THIS PROJECT VAST AMOUNTS OF THE EXISTING PARKING ARE NOT BEING PROPOSED FOR STAPLE INVESTMENT OR MODIFICATION OR DIGGING UP. AND SO THAT STANDARD I THINK THAT STANDARD JUST IS A FACTOR IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES AS NOTE AT THE OUTSETS BY COMMISSIONER MILLS. WE HAVE FLEXIBILITY BUILT IN FOR LANDSCAPING. WE DON'T HAVE THAT BUILT IN FOR,V PARKING. SO I'M HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP ON THOSE PLANS BUT THEY SHOULDN'T BE REDUCED BECAUSE IT SHOULD BE THE PERCENTAGE OF PARKING IF I RECALL.
01:50:55.988: >> COMMISSIONER DISCH.
01:50:58.958: >> I WILL GO AHEAD LIKE TO ASK MR. HIRSCH IF HE COULD RETURN TO THE SLIDE WHERE YOU HAD SOME NUMBERS ON THE AM.I. THAT YOUR RENTS ARE PEGGED TOWARD. SO EXISTING TABLE IN MILL CREEK ARE BETWEEN 70 AND 80 PERCENT AMI. SO I'M INTERNING THAT TO MEAN THAT THE FOLKS WHO RENT IN YOUR PLACES ARE SOMEWHERE -- THAT YOUR RENTAL RATES APPEAL TO FOLKS WHO FALL WITHIN THAT RANGE, IS THAT CORRECT?
01:51:49.541: >> I'M HAPPY TO TAKE THAT ONE. YOU KNOW, WE DO A SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE COUNTY. WHEN THE COUNTY'S AFFORDABLE INFORMATION COMES OUT WHICH IS IN APRIL EVERY YEAR AND LOOK AT WHERE WE FALL, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THERE'S A WHOLE MATHEMATICAL SEQUENCE OF NOT JUST RENT BUT YOU HAVE TO INCLUDE THE UTILITIES TO GET TO A TOTAL NUMBER AND WE DO IT BY BEDROOM. AND AT THE TIME WE ARE ALL IN RENTAL RATE INCLUDING UTILITIES FOR ONE BEDROOM IS $1,355. 17 PERCENT OF AMI WAS $1,938T. TWO BEDROOMS WERE 1673. THE MELT RICK FOR 70 PERCENT WAS 1678 SO AGAIN UNDER. AND THREE BEDROOMS WITHER $1,932. SO WE'RE JUST OVER 70 PERCENT SO THE CURRENT RENT IN COMMUNITY THAT'S HOW THEY TRACK VIS-A-VIS AMI CALCULATIONS.
01:53:03.115: >> AND I KNOW THAT YOU'RE NOT RUNNING AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECT SO I KNOW THAT YOU DON'T QUALIFY PEOPLE. YOU DON'T ASK THEM TO SHOW PROOF THAT'S ALL THEY MAKE, BUT CLEARLY YOU'RE SERVING A CLIENT EL CLIENT EL ALREADY THAT YOU'RE RENTS ARE LESS EXPENSIVE THAN WHAT MANY -- MUCH OF THE HOUSING IN ANN ARBOR GOES FOR. SO I KNOW THIS SOUNDS LIKE I'M TAKING A DETERMINATION DIVERSION BUT I'M NOT. I'M SO HAPPY TO SEE AN INFILL PROJECT LIKE THIS ONE. THIS IS CREATING DENSITY IN A WAY THAT IS NOT JUST PALATABLE TO PEOPLE BUT IT'S ACTUALLY REALLY CONSTRUCTIVE AND AFFIRMING. BECAUSE YOU'RE PROVIDING GREATER DIVERSITY OF TYPES OF HOUSING IN YOUR EXISTING LOCATION AND YOU'RE USING THIS OPPORTUNITY TO UPGRADE THE COMMUNAL AMENITIES IN THIS SIDE. AND I ALSO THINK THAT'S REALLY WONDERFUL. AND WE ARE RIGHT NOW SPENDING A LOT OF TIME DEBATEING -- ASKING YOU TO KIND OF MAKE A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN ADDING ADDITIONAL EV PARKING AND I'M IN FAVOR OF US DOING THAT BUT I WANT US TO FIND A SWEET SPOT AND I ALSO WANT US TO THINK ABOUT WHERE THIS MONEY IS BEST USED. IF YOU'RE ASKING YOU TO PUT MORE MONEY INTO THIS PROJECT WE GET LESSER TO OUR SUSTAINABILITY GOALS BY SAYING IT WOULD REALLY BE GREAT IF YOU A MINIMUM ELECTRIFIED THE APPLIANCES. BUT MAYBE EXPLORING AS COMMISSIONER ABRAMSS SUGGESTED ELECTRIFYING THIS NEW PORTION USING HEAT PUMPS FOR THE HEATING. I MEAN, WHERE WOULD I RATHER YOU SPEND THE MONEY? I'M NOT SURE HOW MANY ELECTRIC VEHICLES OTHER THAN ELECTRIC BICYCLES ARE GOING TO BE IN THIS PROJECT, AND I'M NOT TRYING TO MAKE GENERALIZATIONS ABOUT WHO BUYS ELECTRIC CARS. I'M HONESTLY NOT TRYING TO -- WHATEVER IT IS THAT I'M NOT -- I'M NOT TRYING TO SAY THAT ONLY PEOPLE OF CERTAIN INCOME BUY ELECTRIC VEHICLES BUT I DO THINK THAT WE SHOULD EXPECT THAT THERE WILL BE MORE OVER TIME. I ALSO APPRECIATED THE TWO PERCENT FIGURE THAT COMMISSIONER LEE GAVE US. SO I WOULD I WOULD LIKE US TO PAUSE A MINUTE AND THINK ABOUT ALL OF ALL THE THINGS WE CAN SUGGEST IS THIS THE ONE THAT GETS US THE MOST BANG FOR OUR BUCK? WHEN WE KNOW NOT ONLY DO A LOT OF CARBON EMISSIONS COME FROM HOUSING BUT WE AL KNOW THAT YOU BE DOOR AIR QUALITY IN THE UNITED STATES IS INCREDIBLY BOOR BECAUSE WE ALL HAVE GAS HEATING AND GAS STOVES WHICH RELEASES A LOT OF METHANE IN OUR HOUSE AND THAT'S NOT A DESIRABLE THING. SO I JUST DON'T WANT US TO ASK FOR TOO MUCH OF AN AMENITY THAT MAY NOT PAY OFF FOR A LON TIME WHEREAS MAYBE IN THERE IS SINGLE DIGITS INVESTMENT IT COULD BE IN SOMETHING MORE PRODUCTIVE. AND YOU DON'T NEED TO DEBATE THIS FOR ANOTHER TWO HOURS. I JUST WANTED TO HAVE A TINY LITTLE BIT OF THINKING ABOUT PRIORITIES AND ALSO -- WHAT DO WE WANT TO ACCOMPLISH WITH THIS DEVELOPMENT AND WHO DOES IT SERVE.
01:57:07.459: >> COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL.
01:57:10.796: >> IREFUL APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THAT UP BECAUSE I WAS KIND OF THINKING THE SAME THING. ONE QUESTION THAT I HAVE IS EXISTING RENTAL RATES WHAT ARE YOU PRINCIPALLING -- PLANNING FOR THESE NEW UNITS? THIS IS NOT CONSIDERED AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WE CAN'T HOLD YOU TO ANYTHING SO WHAT I'M WONDERING IS I THINK GENERALLY YOUR DEVELOPMENT IS THERE AND YOUR PROBABLY NOT GOING TO DOUBLE THAT RATE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BECAUSE YOU KIND OF WANT IT TO BE SIDE BY SIDE. NOT TOO FAR AWAY FROM -- I'VE JUST WONDERING WHAT YOUR PLAN IS FOR WHAT YOU WOULD BE CHARGING FOR THESE NEW UNITS BECAUSE IF IT'S GOING TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER, THEN ARE WE GETTING WHAT WEE THINK ARE GETTING BY SEEING THAT STATISTIC THERE.
01:58:07.486: >> I MEAN IT'S A GOOD QUESTION. I THINK THAT AS YOMPINGED IT'S IT'S -- YOU MENTIONED WE'RE NOT TRYING TO FIND TAX CREDIT HOUSING OR ANY THAT SORT OF THING. I COULDN'T TELL YOU WITH CERTAINTY WHAT THE RENTS ARE GOING TO BE. THIS PROJECT IS -- DEPENDING ON HOW THE PROCESS GOES POTENTIALLY TOUCH TWO OR THREE YEARS IN THE FUTURE. SO OUR EXPECTATION IS THAT THEY WILL BE MARKET RATES FOR THAT TYPE IT'S TYPE OF UNIT IN THIS LOCATION, NOT JUST IN OUR COMMUNITY BUT ACROSS THE ROAD IN GENERAL IN SOUTHEAST ANN ARBOR. BUT I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH INFORM TO SIT HERE TODAY ANDS FORECAST THAT.
01:59:02.708: >> WOULD YOU SAY THAT BECAUSE OF YOUR LOCATION AND BECAUSE WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT YOUR NEIGHBORS I'M SURE YOU HAVE SOME SENSE OF WHAT COMPETING RENTS ARE BECAUSE THAT'S YOUR BUSINESS. IS THIS A PRETTY COMMON NEARBY NICHE IN THIS PART OF TOWN? 23.
01:59:29.034: >> IT'S NOT DOWNTOWN FOR SURE. IT'S NOT SUPER WALKABLE OR NEXT TO I SAID 94 AND BASE ON PROXIMITY WHO WHAT PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO PAY MORE FOR.
01:59:44.883: >> BUT DO YOU DO YOU HAVE ANOTHER UNIT -- YOU'RE AWARE THIS OTHER NEIGHBOR IS IMMEDIATELY TO THE NORTH OF YOU --
01:59:53.759: >> NO, I MEAN FUGUE NORTH OF US WE ACTUALLY OWN THE PROJECT IMMEDIATELY TO THE NORTH WHICH IS HOMESTEAD COMMONS WHICH IS ON A AMI BASIS IS LOIRE THAN THE 70 PERCENT. TO THE RIGHT OF THAT IF WE WERE LOOKING AT THE SCREEN IS ANOTHER WHAT I WOULD SAY ANOTHER LOW-INCOME -- PUSH IT THE OTHER WAY AND THEN KEEP GOING THERE'S ONE OF ANN ARBOR'S LAST TRAILER PARK IS THERE. AND NEXT IS A SUBSIDIZED HOUSING PROJECT.
02:00:36.034: >> SO THERE CERTAIN LIMITATIONS BASEDDEN GEOGRAPHY AND WHATEVER THE CONDITION ARE AROUND YOU THAT ARE GOING TO BE COVERING THAT FOR THE MOST PART. I GUESS IF WE'RE GOING TO RELAX SOME THINGS -- A LOT OF PEOPLE COME TO US AND SAY I CAN'T AFFORD TO DO THAT. IF WE'RE RELAXING SOME TNGS REASABLE --OMETHI THAT I IO IS I THI NGHRHOOD OF COST NEGLIGENCE OF RENT. SO I JUST WANT TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT WHAT -- IT'S ONE THING IF IT'S AFFORDABLE HOUSING BECAUSE TH WE KNOW YOU'RE LOCKED IN. YOU'RE UNDER NO OBLIGATION SO I -- --
02:01:40.499: >> AGAIN, IS JUST POINT OUT THAT I THINK A LOT OF PETITIONERS THAT COME BEFORE YOU AND SAY WE CAN'T AFFORD TO DO THAT, THIS TRULY IS AN INFILL PROJECT OF 100 UNIT SOSES WE DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY DO SPREAD OUT ADDITIONAL COSTS BEYOND PROVIDING THE ACTUAL UNIT AND THE HOUSING TO SOME OF THESE THINGS THAT ARE NOT ASPIRATIONAL. THEY'RE GREAT, WE DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO TAKE AN EXTRA $5 PER UNIT AND SPREAD IT OUT OTHER 300 UNITS. IT REALLY IS THIS INFILL OPPORTUNITY SO I THINK THAT WOULD BE KIND OF OUR PERSPECTIVE ON THAT AS IT'S REALLY A LITTLE BIT BETWIXT AND BETWEEN WITH WHAT IT IS AND WHAT WE CAN ACCOMPLISH BASED ON IS IT SIZE.
02:02:44.095: >> TO COMMISSIONER DISCH'S POINT I WOULD WELCOME YOUR THOUGHTS DEVELOPMENT TEAM, MR. MARTIN NEGLIGENCE OF -- REALLY THE EV ORDINANCE IS DRIVEN LARGE LY BY A 20 GOALS AND WITHIN A 20 THERE ARE OTHER THINGS AS COMMISSIONER DISCH APPOINTMENTS OUT. SO ALL THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE DISCUSSED AND KNOW THE MARKET THAT YOU'RE EXPECTING WHAT SEEMS REASONABLE IN YOUR MIND? HERE? WHAT IS POSSIBLE? BECAUSE I AM WITH COMMISSIONER DISCH I WOULD RATHER NOT HAVE INFRASTRUCTURE GO UNUSED. ID THINK IT WILL BE USED. BEFORE THE END OF ITS LIFE BUT WHAT I RECOGNIZE THAT THERE MAY BE SOME THINGS THAT WE CAN HAVE IMMEDIATE GAINS WITH.
02:03:43.822: >> YEAH I THINK MY PREF WOULD BE THAT IF WE WERE ABLE TO CLUSTER MORE PLUG IN STAYSES AROUND THE COMMUNITY CENTER, THAT PROVIDES ACCESS FOR PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY. I WOULD LIKE TO GO BACK TO OUR TEAM. WE HAVEN'T CONTEMPLATED -- OUR THOUGHT WAS THAT GIVEN THE EXISTING UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WAS IN PLACE WHICH AGAIN IF WE LOOK AT FOOTPRINTS AND WHAT WE HAVE TO BRING IN TOWNSHIPS UTILIZING WHAT'S THERE IS THE MOST EFFICIENT, OUR UNITS RIGHT NOW HAVE A SMATTERING OF APPLIANCE UTILITY USAGE. WE HAVE SOME THAT ARE ON NATURAL GAS AND SOME THAT ARE ELECTRIC. I THINK WE COULD GO THROUGH AUCTIONING PROCESS OF WHAT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE WITH RESPECT TO POTENTIALLY SWAPPING SOME OF THOSE THINGS. IT MIGHT BE ON NATURAL GAS FOR ELECTRIC. AGAIN GOING BACK TO THE AMI CONFERENCE STILL TRYING THE KEEP CONSCIOUS ABOUT KEEPING THOSE INPLACE UTILITIES IS STILL PRACTICAL BUT CERTAINLY HAPPY TO EVALUATE THOSE THINGS AND AGREE WITH THE SENTIMENT OF THE SUDDEN EMERGENCE OF A LARGE QUANTITY OF EV VEHICLES IN THIS DEVELOPMENT IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS IS PROBABLY UNLIKELY. SO IF WE CAN PUBLISH THOSE GOALS OF PROVIDING EQUAL ACCESS AND BEING STRATEGIC ABOUT WHERE WE DO PLACE THE ONES WE PUT IN THERE MIGHT BE SOME OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT SOME OTHER GOOD DEAL ASKS AGAIN WE FEEL LIKE THE MERITS OF THE PROJECT ARE PRETTY STRONG WITH RESPECT TO PROVIDING ADDITIONAL HOUSING AND SOME OF THE OTHER KIND OF DIVERSITY OF HOUSING TYPE AND YOU KNOW, COMPLETELYING THAT SIDEWALK AND THE IDEA OF A COMPLETE STREET ARE THIS IS THAT WE'RE PUTTING IN AGAIN WHAT WE CONSIDER TO BE A RELATIVELY SMALL PROJECT. SO HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT IT BUT I THINK WHAT'S WHERE WE WOULD STAND RIGHT NOW.
02:06:12.470: >> .
02:06:12.737: >> I THE WE WENT DOWN THIS ROAD BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE SBA TO GET A VARIANCE FROM THE,V PARKING REQUIREMENT SO I THINK WHERE OUR CONVERSATION STARTED WAS YOU WANTED TO SWAP LIKES FOR LIKES SO YOU'RE ASKING FOR A VARIANCE SO MAYBE YOU SHOULD GIVE MORE THAN THE MINIMUM. AND I THINK WHERE WE OPENED THE CONVERSATION UP MORE IS I THINK THAT MAYBE A BIT MORE,V PARKING AND PLACED STRATEGICALLY THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY CENTER BUT RATHER THAN SWAPPING LIKES FOR LIKES WE BROADEN THE CONSIDERS TO WHO OTHER THINGS WOULD BE DONE TO ANSWER FORWARD THE A 20 GOALS AND I THINK THERE ARE THINGS THAT WOULD BE LESS EXPENSIVE FOR YOU AND MORE EFFECTIVE FOR THE OVERALL A 20 GOALS. AND I KNOW THIS CAPE UP OPHELIA TONIGHT AND I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO TATTOO IT ON YOUR FORE FOREHEAD BUT YOU HAVE SOME TIME BEFORE YOU GO TO THE ZBA TO LOOK AT THAT AND IT WILL COME TO COUNCIL WITH RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WILL WITH A FIRM COMMITMENT BY THEN AND I FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH THAT. I DON'T WANT TO BIND THIS TOO CLOSELY TO A PARTICULAR NUMBER OF CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WHERE WE COULD GET BEER BETTER OUTCOMES.
02:07:45.129: >> WHAT I'M HEARING COMMISSIONER DISCH IF I'M HEAR YOU RIGHT IS THAT RATHER THAN CHANNELING TO ZBA THE PARAMETERS THAT EFFECTSLY LET -- BOTH THINGS HAVE TO HAPPEN BEFORE I GETS TO COUNCIL? IS THAT FAIR? BECAUSE IN MY MIND WHAT A LOT OF THIS HINGES ON, SHOULD THERE BE SOMETHING ABOUT.
02:08:23.067: >> FOR SOME REASON THE ZBA IS IF THIS PROCEEDED TO THE THE ZONING AND IT NEEDED PARKING AND IT WAS NOT GRANTED THEN STAFF -- IF YOUR RECOMMENDATION WITH THAT CAN BE AND THAT CONDITION WAS NOT SATISFIED IT WOULD PROCEED TO CITY COUNCIL WITH A DENIAL THAT IT DOESN'T MIGHT THE CITY'S CODE. WAS THAT THE QUESTION?
02:08:48.192: >> YEAH BAA E-BUT THAT'S ASSUMING WE TIE IT TO A SPIN NUMBER OVERACTIONSV PARKING WHICH IS NOT WHAT I -- --
02:08:58.736: >> TWO REASONS. IF YOU MODIFY IT TO TIE IT TO A SPECIFIC NUMBER AND THAT WASN'T ACHIEVEED THEN -- SO A COUPLE SCENARIOS. ONE NO, NO VARIANCE WAS GRANTED. IT WOULD NOT FIE THE CODE. TWO ANOTHER OPTION WOULD BE IN THE PLANNING COMMISSION DIDN'T MODIFY THE MOTION AS PRESENTED IT'S CONDITIONED UPON YOU'RE REVIEWING A SITE PLAN THAT DOESN'T MEET THE CODE YOU'RE ACKNOWLEDGING THAT AND SAYING THAT IF A AVAILABLE IS NOT GRANT ED TO PROVIDE THIS LEVEL OF EV PARKING THIS WOULD NOT MEET THE CODE OR THIRD IF YOU WERE TO MODIFY THAT IN THAT CASE THE ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS COULD MAKE SOME OTHER DETERMINATION, THETY IT ISER WOULD MEET THAT STANDARD AND TECHNICALLY DESPITE YOUR RECOMMENDATION OF A PARTICULAR NUMBER IT WOULD PROCEED TO CITY COUNCIL COMPLIANT AT THAT POINT WITH CODE.
02:10:11.776: >> EITHER WAY WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THERE'S TIME BEFORE IT GETS BACK TO THINK ABOUT WHAT IT IS THAT -- KNOWING THE ALMOSTS OF THAT WE HAVE DUAL GOAL IN THE CITY BOTH ABOUT AROUNDABLETY AND SUSTAINABILITY. AND THINKING ABOUT COST EFFECTIVELY HOW TO ACHIEVE THOSE. THERE'S TIME FOR THAT. COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL.
02:10:43.508: >> I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS AN OPTION AND IF IT'S NOT YOU CAN WEIGH IN ON THIS. GIVEN THE THIRD OWNERSHIPS THAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THERE WOULD BE AN ALTERNATE ROUTE I'M WONDERING IF NONE OF US HERE -- PERHAPS COMMISSIONER MILLS PROBABLY ANN NOBODY ON THE DEVELOPMENT TEAM NECESSARILY KNOWS WHAT THE BANG FOR YOUR BUCK THING IS THAT THE CITY WANS. SO WHAT I'M WONDERING IS GIVEEN THIS PROCESS, OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE THE DEVELOPMENT TEAM, THAT'S YOUR JOSH BUT I'M WONDERING IF THERE'S A WAY TO GET THE VOICE OF THE SUSTAINABILITY OFFICE INTO THIS CONVERSATION SO THEY CAN SAY WHAT MAKES THE BIGGEST DIFFERS IS ELECTRIFYING THE BUILDINGS 678 IT'S MORE LIKE HERE'S THIS POT OF MONEY THAT'S GOING TO HAVE TO HAPPEN NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO IN TERMS OF HOW YOU'RE HANDLING THE EV THING AND THAT AMOUNT IS GOING TO CHANGE DEPENDING ON WHAT THE STRATEGY WOULD BE. BUT IF WE COULD GET 1078 SORT OF EXPERIENCE BECAUSE THEY WOULD HAVE TO HIRE THAT EXPERIENCE TO BE ABLE THE RUN THOSE NUMBERS AND I FEEL LIKE WE HAVE THAT EXPERTISE IN THE CITY IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO HAVE THEM WEIGH IN ON IT. I DON'T FEEL LIKE I NEED TO KNOW -- WE'RE HANGING OUR HAT ON THE EV THING, BECAUSE THAT'S A CODE WE HAVE NOT NECESSARILY WHAT IS THE MOST EFFICACIOUS. SO I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S SO FAR AWAY FROM WHAT OUR OPTIONS ARE AND I WOULD BE CURIOUS IF THAT'S SOMETHING YOU CAN SEE HALFWAY BETWEEN NOW AND ZBA TO GET A SENSE OF WHERE IT DOES MAKE SOUTHERN NEW ENGLAND SENSE TO PUT THAT ENERGY ENERGY INTO IN TERMS OF DEALING WITH ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SCENARIOS.
02:13:02.580: >> MY INITIAL VACCINATION I DON'T THINK THAT'S APPROPRIATE. THIS DISCUSSION ABOUT OTHER SUSTAINABILITY FACTORS HAS TO BE RELEVANT TO YOUR DECISION ON REZONING THIS PROPERTY TEMPERATURE SITE PLAN IS BEING MEASURED AGAINST STANDARDS IN OUR EVC AND THAT'S WHERE THE; PARKING SPECIFICALLY I DON'T THINK THAT'S NECESSARILY SOMEING U HAVE LEVERAGEN. WHEN WRE TALKING ABOUT ECTRIFATION IF YOU DON TISFD I WAY TO MEET OURBNG MASTER PLAN TO SUPPORT THE RESOING THEN IHINK IT WOU BE DIFCULT T MAKE THAT ROAMING NTGENT UPON SO MY GUT IS IF THAT IS THE SCENARIO THAT YOU FEEL IS IMPORTANT BEFORE THE PLANNING COMMISSION MAKES A RECOMMENDATION ON THE ZONING ASPECT OF THIS AS RELATES TO OUR COMPREHENSIVE PLAN THEN I THINK THAT'S AN INVESTIGATION THAT YOU WOULD WANT THIS TEAM TO LOOK AT AND COME BACK TOE BEFORE YOU MAKE THAT ZONING DETERMINATION. I DON'T THINK IT'S AS RELEVANT TO THE SITE PLAN.
02:14:30.134: >> ALL RIGHT. THAT'S HELPFUL. S THANKS.
02:14:38.075: >> COMMISSIONER DISCH.
02:14:40.344: >> I DON'T WANT TO DELAY THIS SO I DON'T WANT US TO POSTPONE THIS SITE APPROVAL. THIS HAS BEEN A THOUGHTFUL DISCUSSION AND THIS IS A THOUGHTFUL PROJECT AND CONSIDERABLE TIME AND WORK'S BEEN INVESTED INTO BRINGING WHAT'S BEFORE US. ALL I'M TRYING TO DO IS RESPOND TO THE IDEA THAT THERE WAS -- IT WAS INDICATEED THAT THERE WOULD IT'S THERE WILL NEED TO BE SOME NEGOTIATION WITH THE ZBA TO JUSTIFY GRANTING THE VARIANTS TO AND I WOULD RATHER SEE THAT BE A REALLY USEFUL SISTER AND THAT'S KIND OF BETWEEN YOU AND THEM. SO WE'VE MADE SOME SUGGESTIONS AS TO WHAT YOU CAN DO AND YOU MIGHT END UP JUST DECIDING IT'S A LOT EASIER TO THROW IN TEN MORE,V SPACES AND PLACE THEM AS WE HAVE DISCUSSED. AND SO THAT'S -- I WAS RESPONDING TO THE IDEA THAT THERE WAS A NEGOTIATION THAT NEED TO GO ON WITH THE ZBA AND WE WENT DOWN A BIG ROAD WHERE WE STARTED TO SEAMED AND SPECIFY AND I WANTED NOT TO HAVE THAT HAPPEN.
02:16:03.694: >> MR. LENART.
02:16:05.396: >> I WANT TO BE CAREFUL. THE ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS IS BY NO MEAN AS NEGOTIATION SO THEY HAVE TO CONSIDER THE VARIANCE STANDARD ASKS MAKE A DETERMINATION. I THINK AT TIMES IT CAN COME ACROSS IN THAT WAY BECAUSE ONE OF THE STANDARDS IS THE PROPOSED VARIANCE THE MINIMUM NECESSARY TO CHIEF IT'S -- SO IT'S A NUANCED WAY TO USE HANDLE BUT IT ISN'T A NEGOTIATION IN THE SAME WAY THAT PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT OR CONDITIONAL ZONING ORDINANCE ON CASES OR A TYPICAL REOTHER THANKING ARE FROM A LEGISLATE IVE PERSPECTIVE. WE CAN CONVEY TO THE ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS THE PLANNING DISCUSSION GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE THE SITE A HIGHER PROVISION OF EV PARKING COMPLIANCE CAN BE OBTAINED ON THIS PROJECT BUT I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT YOU'RE MAKING A REM BASEs ON THAT ADVICE. THE ZONING BOARD OF APPEAL APPEALS WILL ULTIMATELY MAKE THAT DETERMINATION.
02:17:56.373: >> GIVEN THAT'S THE CASE, WE CAN CHANNEL THEM THE THINGS THEY MIGHT CONSIDER BUT THEY HAVE THEIR OWN STANDARDS AND WE HAVE OURS SO THE THIS IS BEFORE US ARE TWOFOLD. HAS THE PETITIONER KNEAD MADE A CASE THAT SUPPORTS REZONING, ONE, FROM L3 TO R FOUR B, AND THEN TWO, DO WENT THE SITE PLAN COMPLIES AND WE OUGHT TO ALLOW THE LANDSCAPE MODIFICATIONS, WHICH WOULD ALLOW THE EXISTING PARKING LOTS TO STAND AS THEY ARE. AND I THINK ON THE FIRST PART I FEEL LIKE THE CASE FOR REZONING MAKES SENSE AND THE ON THE SITE PLAN THE CHANGE THAT I THINK AUTOTO BE MADE IS ABOUT THE BICYCLE PARKING. IN PART BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THIS IS A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE WILL BIKE, THE PETITIONER AGREES THAT IT MAKES SOUTHERN NEW ENGLAND, THERE'S ECONOMIES OF SCALE OF DOING IT NOW AND SO I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT AS WHEN THIS MOVES FORWARD THAT THE VERSION THAT CITY COUNCIL SEES INCLUDES THOSE PROVISIONS. SOMETIMES MR. LEONARD THAT'S JUST WE CHALLENGED THIS TO STAFF AND IT DOESN'T NEED A FORMAL AMENDMENT, WHICH WOULD YOU ADVISE?
02:19:40.344: >> I WANT TO BE CLEAR I HEARD REFERENCE TO ADD CLASS BECOMES BIKE PARKING WHICH IS NOT REQUIRED. SO WHAT I'M HAPPY TO DO IS JUST TAKE THAT FEEDBACK AND WORK WITH THEM TO IDENTIFY SOME SPOTS ON THE SITE WHERE THEY CAN ACCOMPLISH ONE OR BOTH OF THOSE AND WHAT WE COULD DO IS COMMUNICATE TO THE CITY COUNCIL THAT THIS WAS A QUESTION THAT WAS RAISED AT PLANNING COMMISSION THAT THE OPPORTUNITY FOR MORE OF THAT AND THIS IS HOW THE PETITIONER RESPONDED THEY ADDED X ADDITION NUMBER OF SPACE ON THE PROPERTY AND THAT WOULD BE INCORPORATED INTO THE SITE PLAN THAT. GIVES THE COUNCIL MEMBER DISCH THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE THIS CONVERSATION AND SHARE THAT AT THE CITY COUNCIL TABLE WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND TO WHETHER OR NOT THAT RESONATES AS BEING RESPONSIVE OR NOT TO THE DISCUSSION. SO I DON'T FEEL LIKE WE NEED A MOTION, I'M HAPPY TO WORK WITH PETITIONER TO EXPLORE THAT. WHAT IT MEANS IS THAT WE WILL WORK WITH THEM TO ACCOMMODATE IT THE BEST WE CAN AND COMMUNICATE THAT.
02:20:57.621: >> I'M COMFORTABLE WITH THAT. OTHER COMMENTS, QUESTIONS, DISCUSSION? RIGHT NOW WE HAVE THE TWO MOTION MOTIONS. THERE WERE BEEN NO AMENDMENTS. IF THERE'S NOTHING ELSE THEN I THINK THAT WE'RE READY FOR A VOTE. IF YOU COULD DO A ROLL CALL VOTE PLEASE MR. LENART.
02:21:22.946: >> ABSOLUTELY. SO THIS IS ON BOTH MOTIONS WITH THE CLARIFIES THAT I WOULD SAY I WILL WORK WITH THE PETITIONER TO ADDRESS ADDITIONAL BICYCLE PARK ING AND ASK FOR AT LEAST A RESPONSE FOR OTHER SUSTAINABILITY ASPECTS. BUT I WOULD SAY THAT THAT IS LARGELY A DISCUSSION OF SEEING WHAT THEY CAN INCORPORATE BUT WE WILL COMMUNICATE THAT THEY INVESTIGATED THAT.
02:21:56.880: >> AND YOU WILL CONTINUE YOUR RESEARCH O PARK AND WHAT THE DEAL IS THERE BECAUSE THAT'S GOING TO FACTOR INTO A LOT OF YOUR CALCULATIONS.
02:22:05.222: >> I DID FIND ONE MAP THAT REFERENCED DEDICATED BUT SOMEBODY WROTE IT BY HAND AND I CAN'T FIND MY OTHER LANGUAGE. COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL.
02:22:17.634: >> YES.
02:22:18.635: >> COMMISSIONER SAVE.
02:22:22.005: >> YES.
02:22:23.173: >> MR. ABRAMSS.
02:22:26.176: >>.
02:22:26.610: >> COMMISSIONER DISCH.
02:22:29.113: >> YES.
02:22:29.646: >> ECONOMIC E-COMMISSIONER LEE.
02:22:31.682: >> COMMISSIONER CLARKE.
02:22:34.184: >> YES.
02:22:34.685: >> COMMISSIONER WIFE.
02:22:40.157: >> YES.
02:22:40.524: >> COMMISSIONER MILLS.
02:22:43.026: >> YES.
02:22:45.395: >> UNANIMOUS. VERY GOOD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ALL RIGHT. CAN WE TAKE A -- WHAT TIME IS IT? CAN WE TAKE A FIVE MINUTE BREAK TO FILL WATER BOTTLES AND STRETCH OUR LEGS AND COME BACK AT 9:30. .
02:27:55.738: >>> THIS IS 700 TAPPAN STREET. THE AMENDED PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT ZONING FOR CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL. WE'LL DO OUR NORMAL PETITIONER PRESENTATION FOR UP TO TEN MINUTES AND THEN MOVE TO MR. CAN A WALL AND I AND WE'LL OPEN THE PUBLIC HEARING. DO YOU MEAN TO GO OFF --
02:30:13.977: >> MAYBE SHE'S NOT BACK YET. AND WE LOST COMMISSIONER CLARKE. MAYBE SHE'S HAVING ISSUES. WHY DON'T WE GO AHEAD AND WE WILL CATCH HER UP ONCE SHE'S ABLE TO RECONNECT.
02:31:34.124: >> OKAY, SHOULD I BEGIN, THEN?
02:31:37.994: >> GO AHEAD.
02:31:38.995: >> MY NAME IS SCOTT MONZEM OKLAHOMAL. I'VE REPRESENTING THE OWNER OF.COM MICK ASKS RICH McLEOD. MIKE IS ON THE CALL BUT I THINK HERE'S PHONING IN. I APPRECIATE THE LENGTHY DISCUSSION YOU HAD ON THE PRIOR APPLICATION SO I WILL TRY TO BE FAIRLY BRIEF. TO START OUT THIS IS AN APPLICATION TO MODIFY THET OF AN EXISTING PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS. THE DEALS WITH THE TIMING OF CURB CUT REMOVAL. IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THERE'S ZERO PHYSICAL CHAINS BEING PROPOSED. MR. DEVARDI PLANS TO DO NOTHING FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE AND THIS REQUIREMENT WAS TRIGGERED DUE TO THE EXCEPTION SPECIAL USE APPLICATION THAT MR. McLEOD HAS HAD OF HIS MARIJUANA DISPENSARY. BUT IT'S TO GO BACK AND GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF HISTORY. THE ORIGINAL PLANNED UNITE DEVELOPMENT WAS APPROVED IN 2009, THIS BUT THE REASON IT WAS DONE WAS THAT AS MANY PEOPLE ARE AWARE OF DOMINICK'SS THE AN UNUSUAL LOCATION. THIS IS ONE OF THE THIS IS THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE CHARM OF THE CITY WHICH IS THE DIFFERENT USE SPRING UP IN DIFFERENT PLACES AND MR. DEVARDI, IT'S A COMMERCIAL RESTAURANT USE SURROUNDED BY RESIDENTIAL USES. IT WAS CONSIDERED NONCONFORMING BACK IN THE 2000S AND THAT CREATED CERTAIN ORIGINAL ISSUES FOR HIM, SO ONE WAY TO CURE THAT IN A WAY WAS TO SEEK PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT ZONING FOR HIS PROPERTIES. IN WHICH WE DID AND THEREFORE IT CURRENTLY IS QUOTE, UNQUOTE, CONFORMING BECAUSE THE USES ARE CAPTURED. AT THE TIME HE WAS NOT SURE OF WHAT IF ANYTHING HE COULD DO BUT HE HAD A PROPOSED CONCEPT PLAN ON WHAT COULD HAPPEN AND THAT IS THE SCREEN THAT'S SHOWN THERE AND I'VE BROKEN IT DOWN INTO FOUR AREAS BUT THE PROCESS HATCHED AREAS WERE AREAS HE THOUGHT HE MIGHT UNDERTAKE SOME CONSTRUCTION IN THE FUTURE. BUT THE CITY COUNCIL JUST APPROVED THE,UD WITH A CONCEPT PLAN WHICH IS NOT UNUSUAL. YOU CAN DO A TWO STEP PLANNED DEVELOPMENT AND WE KNEW AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE IF HEMP TO UNDERTAKE ACTUAL CONSTRUCTION HE WOULD HAVE TO COME BACK AND PROVIDE AROUND ACTUAL SITE PLAN FOR THE CITY TO RUFF WHICH REVIEW. NOW WHEN AND IF COURT THE SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATION WHEN -- THEY BASICALLY SAID THAT THERE WAS REFERENCE TO THE CURB CUTS AND WHICH WAS POINTED OUT IN THE STAFF REPORT BUT THE IMPORTANT LANGUAGE ACTUALLY IS THE NEXT SENTENCE WHICH WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE STAFF REPORT. HE TALK ABOUT THE OFF-STREET PARKING SPACES, ABOUT THE NUMBERS AND IT SAYS USE LESS CURB CUTS SHALL BE REMOVED AND THE CURBS SHALL BE RESTORED AS THE FIRST PUD SITE PLAN. NOW MR. DEVETERAN'SVARDI NEVER APPLIED FOR A SITE PLAN SO THERE WAS NO TRIGGER FOR THE CURB CUTS TO BE REMOVED SO FROM 2009 THROUGH THE LATE 2018, 2019 FOR TEN YEARS OR SO THE CURB CUTS ALL REMAINED IN PLACE WHICH HAVE EXACTLY WHAT THE LANGUAGE AT THE CITY COUNCIL ADOPTED WOULD HAVE ANTICIPATED. THAT CURB CUTS REMAIN IN PLACE UNTIL A SITE PLAN WAS APPROVED AND THEN HE WOULD HAVE TO TAKE OUT THE CURB CUTS. SO IT HAS NOT BEEN OUT OF ZONING COMPLIANCE UNTIL THIS TECHNICAL THING HAPPENED AND I'M, THIS IS KIND OF LONG BUT THE CITY WHEN THEY ADOPTED THE MARIJUANA DISPENSARY REGULATIONS REQUIRED EVERY DISPENSARY TO SUBMIT A SIDE PLAN. SO WHAT HAPPENED WAS MR. MEASURE CLOUD SUBMITTED A SITE PLAN AND THAT THE CITY CONSIDERED THE FIRST SITE PLAN WHICH TRIGGERED THE CURB CUT REMOVAL REQUIREMENT. REFRESH A SITE PLAN ISN'T REQUIRED UNTIL YOU'RE ACTUALLY UNDERTALK ABOUTING CONSTRUCTION. MR. MINNESOTA CLOUD IS CONSIDERING ZERO CONSTRUCTION ON THE SIDE SO THIS IS WHERE WE GOT CAUGHT UP IN THE:UNFORTUNATE LANGUAGE AND CONCEPT OF WHAT THE CITY COUNCIL APPROVED BACK IN 2009 WHICH TYPICALLY WOULD NOT REQUIRE THE CURB CUTS REMOVED UNTIL THERE WAS A SITE PLAN CONTEMPLATING CONSTRUCTION. BUT THE CERTAINLY POSSESSIONS FOR MARIJUANA DISPENSARIES DISS REQUIRED A SITE PLAN, SO IT'S PUT US IN IN UNUSUAL KIND OF SITUATION. WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO DO IS -- McLEOD'S BUILDING IS IN B, THE E-IT'S 700 TRAP PAN STREET SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT YOU CAN SEE THERE IS SOME DIAGONAL CROSSED IN HATED LINED. THAT IS CURRENTLY AN EXISTING LEGALARKING SPACE THAT'S USED BY A TENANT WHO LIVES ABOVE THE EA MKED A S S USEIN THE RBUT TO APARTMENARK ARCRDI WANTS TO RETAIN THAT CURB SPACE AND THIS CONTEMPLATED THERE WOULD BE CONSTRUCTION WHICH WOULD I ELIMINATE THE PARKING SPACE AND THEREFORE THE CURB CUT WOULDN'T BE USE LESS. BUT NOW THE CURB CUT IS NOT USELESS AND IT'S THE BE YOUs AND IT'S IMPORTANT PACKET FOR MR. DEVARDI AND HIS TENANT WHICH THE TENANT WOULD HAVE TO FIND ON STREET PARKING THIS THIS NEIGHBORHOOD WITH THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS, WHICH IS NOT A VERY WORKABLE SOLUTION. BUT AGAIN I DO WANT TO NOTE TECHNICALLY IT WAS NOT A NONCOMPLIANCE WITH THE '07ING ORDINANCE UNTIL THE SIDE PLAN REQUIREMENT OF THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE FOR THE MARIJUANA DISPENSARIES. SO IT'S A COMPLICATED SCENARIO THAT WHY WE ARRIVED AT WHERE WE ARE TODAY. SOL AGAIN, NO PLAN TO MAKE ANY CONSTRUCTION AND SO WE WOULD LIKE TO TWEAK THE LANGUAGE OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS SUCH THAT IT REFLECTS WHAT WE BELIEVE THE TRUE INTENT OF COUNCIL WAS WHICH IS WHEN THERE IS CONSTRUCTION, IT WOULD ONE OF THOSE AREAS IT WOULD THEN ELIMINATE THE PARKING SPACE AND THAT'S WHEN WE WOULD REMOVE THE CURB CUT SO MUCH CITIZEN PARTNERS MEETING HAPPEN. ONE PERSON ATTEND. NOO, SHE SUPPORTED IT. WE BELIEVE THE PUBLIC B. WE OFF IS RAIN GUARD IN EXCHANGE FOR THE TWEAK. BUT ONE OF THE IMPORTANT THINGS TO REMEMBER A KEY PART OF THE APPLICATION IS THAT THERE WOULD BE PERMANENT PLANTERS INSTALLED THAT WOULD PREVENT ANY PARKING NORTH OF BUILDING WHICH SEEMED TO BE ONE OF THE CONCERNS FOR SAFETY. THERE'S NEVER BEEN A PERVERTED INCIDENT AND THE PLANTERS WOULD PREVENT ANY PARKING ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THAT BUILDING. SO THAT WAS ONE OF THE MAJOR ISSUES THAT MR. McLEOD ADDRESSED SO WE THINK THE PUBLIC BENEFIT OF THE THE RAIN GARDEN THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS.
02:41:49.138: >> THANK YOU. MR. KAWALLSKI.
02:42:01.217: >> OKAY, HE COVERED QUITE A BIT IN THERE SO I'M NOT GOING TO GO BACK INTO THE HISTORY. SO WE'LL DO A LITTLE BRIEF THING HERE THAT I THINK WE'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE. AGAIN IT'S DIRECTLY ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE BUSINESS SCHOOL. SO THIS IS REALLY THE CRUX OF ONE OF THE ISSUES IS THIS PICTURE HERE. SO THIS IS THE AREA THAT AGAIN THEY WERE  POINTING TO BLOCK OFF WITH PLANTER BLOCKS BUT LIFE THE PAYMENT IN PLACE BUT KIND OF CONSTRUCT A PLANTER BOX TO PROHIBIT PARKING BUT REALLY THE LARGEST CONCERN WAS THAT PARKING. PEOPLE HAD TO BACK OUT AACROSS THE STREET THE DRIVEWAY. ONE IN THIS SHOT YOU CAN SEE WHAT THEY'RE PROPOSING IS PART OF THE BENEFIT TOWNSHIPS AREA TO THE GRASSED IN AREA AND I HAVE A SLIGHT AMENDMENT TO MY STAFF ERROR IN THAT I DID SPEAK WITH THE STORE OWNER SO HE IS WORKING WITH ENGINEERING ON THIS AND HEMS THAT FOR WHAT THAT'S WORD THEY COULD MODIFY THAT THAT WILL IT WILL MEET CODE 678 I DON'T HAVE A PLAN YET THAT SAYS THAT BUT CERTAINLY WHAT THAT RAIN GUARD WOULD GATHER IS ALL THE ROOF WATER AND THEY ARE PROPOSING A TRENCH DRAIN THAT WOULD REMAIN PARALLEL THAT KIND OF TRENCH DRAIN 689 SO THIS PARRING SPACE WHICH IS BEHIND THAT BUILDING, IT IS TECHNICALLY A LEGAL SPACE SO THAT IS THE SPACE THAT THE PETITIONER WANTS TO PRESERVE, SO THEY HAVE AGREED TO BLOCK OFF THAT AREA TO THE LEFT AND PRESERVE THE ACCESS TO THAT PARKING SPACE. I THINK IN WE GO TO ONE MORE SLIDE IT'S ANOTHER VIEW AND THE LAST VIEW I BELIEVE IS WHAT -- IF WE CAN LEAVE THIS UP FOR A SECOND, SO IT IS CORRECT AGAIN, THE ORIGINAL -- THE MOST RECENT P UD THAT COVERED THIS DID ENVISION A MUCH LARGER DEVELOPMENT. AGAIN YOU CAN SEE THE CONCEPT PLAN HADITHS HAD THESE AREAS TO BE FILLED IN. HOWEVER THE ZONING WAS APPROVE WITH THE CURB CUTS TO BE CLOSE. IT HAD A MAXIMUM TO HAVE TWO CURB CUTS AND AS A REQUIREMENT. SO IN GOING IN LOOKING THROUGH THE PROCEDURE -- SO THIS WAS ALSO AN ISSUE, THE SITE PLAN THROUGH THE -- SO WHEN THIS WAS ORIGINALLY APPROVED THE PU D, THERE WASN'T A BUILDING THERE SO THE PRO-ADVICE USE DID COME OUT AFTERWARD AND THAT CURRENT -- THE OPERATOR OF THAT IS A SUBSTANTIATE OF THAT LARGER COMPLEX. SO THE THROUGH THE DEMOCRATIC DELIBERATIONS OF THAT THEY AS ONE OF THE CONDITIONS IN THAT THEY ALSO REQUESTED THE PLANNING COMMISSION AT THE TIME AND I'M NOT SURE IF THERE ARE ANY MEMBER ON THE BOARD WERE THERE. WHERE IS SARAH? HAD REQUESTED THAT CURB CUT BE CLOSED PRIOR TO -- THAT THE PETITIONER SUBMITS A SITE PLAN SHOWING THE CURB CUT CLOSED PRIOR TO ISSUANCE OF THE CO, UNFORTUNATELY A CO WAS ISSUED IN ERROR BUT THEY HAVE A CO TOE OCCUPY THAT BUILDING. SO WE'VE GOT A COUPLE OF ISSUES AND AGAIN THAT ZONING THAT COVERS THIS PARCEL IS REALLY THE CRUX OF THE ISSUE BECAUSE AGAIN FOR THE ZONING CON FORMANTLES THING THERE ARE CERTAINLY REQUIREMENTS THAT THE PROPERTY HAS THE ADHERE TO AND AS STAFF LOOKS AT IT AGAIN THERE'S A REQUIREMENT FOR TWO CURB CUTS THEY EXCEED THAT. IT DOESN'T SPECIFY WHICH CURB CAN YOU IT'S CUT NEEDED TO BE CLOSED BY IT'S BUT I THINK IT'S THE ONE ON MONROE AND OAKLAND BUT THE OBVIOUSLY ONE IS A LARGER PARKING AREA AND THROUGH THE DELIBERATIONS -- I WAS NOT THE ORIGINAL PLANNER FOR THE LARGER PROJECT BUT IN SPEAK WELCOME THAT PLANER AND GOING THROUGH THE RECORDS IN PART OF GOING THROUGH STAFF'S ANALYSIS HERE ON OUR TAKEAWAYS FROM WHAT THEY'RE PROPOSING IS THAT IT WAS -- THAT WAS A SIGNIFICANT PART OF DISCUSSION AND EVEN OBVIOUSLY IS PART OF THE ORIGINAL PUD BUT EVEN AFTER THAT AS THE SIDE PLAN 700 TAPPAN THAT WAS ALSO A SIGNIFICANT TALKING POINT OF THE PLANNING COMMISSION. NOW, THERE WAS DISCUSSION, IT WASN'T NECESSARILY SPECIFIED BETWEEN THE PARKING THAT ACCESSES BEHIND THAT BUILDING VERSUS THE PARKING PARALLEL TO THAT SIDEWALK, WHICH IS AGAIN PART OF THE MUCH LARGER SAFETY ISSUE BUT THAT WAS ALL PART OF THE LARGER DISCUSSION THAT PLANNING COMMISSION DETERMINED THAT CURB CUT NEEDED TO BE CLOSED AND IT WOULD IMPROVE THE SAFETY OF THE AREA. SO STAFF USED THAT AS PART OF OUR JUMPS. JUSTIFIES AND THAT WAS A NO RAINER. THE SAFETY BACKING ACROSS THE SIDEWALK. THE TRANSPORTATION ENGINEER ABSOLUTELY GUARANTEED THAT'S A HAZARDOUS SITUATION. THERE WAS MORE FEEDBACK ON BACKING OUT OF THAT SPACE BEHIND THAT BUILDING. THAT WILL BE USED LESS FREQUENTLY THAN OBVIOUSLY A CUSTOMER SPACE. SO BUT AGAIN THAT CONCERN WAS THERE SO AGAIN, I THINK THAT COVERS A LOT OF THE DISCUSSION. I THINK WE'VE GOT THAT ALL COVERED AND I BELIEVE RIGHT NOW SO I DO EXPECT SOME QUESTIONS AND SO I'M AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS.
02:49:43.612: >> THANK YOU. I WILL OPEN UP THE MIGHT BE HEARING. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PERSONS TO SPEAK UP TO THREE MINUTES. IF YOU WISH TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION ON THIS ITEM PRESS STAR NINE IF YOU DIALED IN OR YOU YOU CAN USE THE RAISED HAND ISSUE. THE PHONE NUMBER IS 877-8535 24/7 AND OUR MEETING ARRIVED IS 97763041226. CITY STAFF WILL CALL ON YOU BY THE LAST THREE DIGITS OF YOUR TELEPHONE NUMBER OR IF YOUR ON ZOOM YOU CAN SAY YOUR NAME. YOU'LL HEAR AN AUTOMATED ANNOUNCEMENT WHEN MR. LENART PROMPT PROMOTES YOU TO SPIKE. PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS FOR THE RECORD. IF YOU WANT TO PROVIDE A PRICK PRS STAR NE.NTSE RSE HD OR I GUS THE MOTION IS SHO. THE MOTION READS --CTUALLY THE OPOSEDOTION IN THE SCRIPT. GIVE ME A MINUTE TO PULL UP THE PROPOSED MOTION BECAUSE IT SEEMS ODDLY SHORT. THE CITY PLANNING COMMISSION HEREBY RECOMMENDS THE MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL APPROVED THE CASA DEVELOPMENT PUD REVISED ACCEPT MENTAL REGULATION. CAN I HAVE A COMMISSIONER MOVE THAT? MOVED BY -- JUST A MINUTE. MOVED BY COMMISSIONER DISCH. SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER LEE. ANYBODY WANT TO KICK OFF CONVERSATION OR DO YOU WANT BACKGROUND ON THE TWO OF US WHO HAVE SEEN THIS A COUPLE OF TIME? COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL DO YOU WANT TO START OFF OR DO YOU MEAN --
02:52:19.167: >> THIS IS THE THIRD TIME I THINK WE'VE BEEN AROUND. I HAVE TO SAY I'M FEELING A LITTLE IMPATIENT WITH THIS TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST: HONEST. WHEN I SENSE IS WHEN YOU PUT FORTH -- I SEE WITH A YOU'RE SAYING ABOUT THE LANGUAGE BUT WHEN YOU PUT FORTH THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE YOU OPEN YOURSELF UP AGAIN TO ANALYSIS AND WITH THAT ANALYSIS WE WERE SO SUPER CLEAR ABOUT CLOSING UP THAT CURB CUT BECAUSE IT WAS PART OF THE ORIGINAL DEBATE AND WHEN I LOOK AT THE PHOTOS THERE'S CARS PARKED. I THINK IT'S DISINGENUOUS TO SAY WITH WANT TO PUT UP A PLANTER BECAUSE CLEARLY IT'S BEING USED THAT WAY. SO I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE KIND OF TAKING UP OUR TIME FRANKLY. I DON'T FEEL SUPPORT IIVE OF GRANTING THIS AT ALL AND THAT'S MY BALD STATEMENT AT THIS POINT IN THE NIGHT.
02:53:37.546: >> I CAN ADD IN SOME OF THE DISCUSSION IN THE PAST, WE TALKED ABOUT WHICH CURB CUT. WE LOOKED AT THE INITIAL LANGUAGE SO THERE WAS A HEALTHY DISCUSSION, THERE WAS A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT WHERE WOULD CUSTOMERS PARK, I REMEMBER LIKE PULLING UP GOOGLE STREET VIEW AND SHOW THERE ARE HANDICAPS PARKING SPOTS RIGHT THERE. A LOT OF THESE ARE THINGS WE DID COVER AT -- GOOGLE STREET VIEW RIGHT NOW NOT ON THE MONROE STREET SIDE SACHETS FROM OCTOBER 20 SHOWING A CAR IN THE PLACE WHERE TWO YEARS PRIOR WE SAID THERE -- I MEAN, AND THIS IS A QUESTION FOR STAFF. LIKE, IS THAT EVER LEGAL? I SEEM TO RECALL BEFORE THAT THAT'S -- YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO PARK THERE.
02:54:33.435: >> THAT'S CORRECT, THE THERE'S CERTAIN PROSECUTES THAT HAVE -- THERE'S A BOOK BANG IN CITY HALL THAT HAD CERTAIN COPIES HAD BEEN GRANDFATHERED IN. WE DID NOT HAVE THAT REPORTED ON THIS SITE. WHEN THIS SIDE WAS ESTABLISHED OR I'M SORRY THE PARKING BUT THAT'S CORRECT, YOU KENT E-CAN'T PARK.
02:54:56.158: >> SO IT'S A NONSTARTER FOR ME IN THE PAVEMENT STAYS. EVEN IF IT'S PLANTED UNLESS IT'S SOMETHING IT'S SO -- IT'S SUCH A GREAT RAIN GARDEN THAT IT WOULD BE TOO WET TO PARK IN. I FEEL LINING THIS LIKE -- IT'S DIFFICULT FOR ME TO IMAGINE THIS SEEMS INGRAINED TO PARK THERE SO I SHARE COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL'S SENSE OF DEJA VU. COMMISSIONER CLARKE.
02:55:39.601: >> [INDISCERNIBLE] I WANT A CLARIFIES ABOUT OCCUPANCY THAT WAS ISSUED BY -- I'M NOT SURE I UNDERSTOOD THAT AND THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT MAYBE YOU COULD CLARIFY.
02:55:56.251: >> I CAN TAKE THAT. SO IDEALLY WHEN WE HAVE A DEVELOPMENT LIKE THIS WE MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE SATISFIED ALL THE CONDITIONS PRIOR TO ISSUING A CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY. THIS THE CIRCUMSTANCE WE JUST BROKE DOWN SO I HAVE TO OWN THAT MISTAKE. WE HAD SIGNED ON THE CERTIFICATOR OF OCCUPANCY FOR THIS USE. NOW THAT'S BEEN ISSUEDON IT'S APPROPRIATE TO REMOVE IT BUT RIGHT NOW THEY ARE IN VIOLATION OF THE APPROVAL. IT'S NOT BEEN OFFED CONSISTENT WITH THAT SO WE CAN TAKEA ON IT BUT THEY HAVE EXPRESSED AN INTEREST IN PURSUING IN AS AN OPTION AND WE THOUGHT WE WOULD AFFORD THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THIS PROCESS TO BEAR OUT. IF IT'S FUN SUCCESSFUL WE WOULD WORK WITH THEM TO ESTABLISH A REASONABLE TIME FRAME TO COMPLY AND IF NOT YOU WOULD WILL CITATIONS WOULD BE ISSUEED?
02:57:08.356: >> ANYTHING ELSE COMMISSIONER CLARKS? COMMISSIONER ABOSTONACHE ABE RONES.
02:57:23.104: >> THE CORRECT CHRONOLOGY -- SAMES ODD THAT WE WOULD GRANT AN EXCEPTION BASED ON ERROR. SO I'M NOT ININCLINED TO VOTE IN SUPPORT OF IT. THAT'S ALL. THANKS.
02:57:46.094: >> COMMISSIONER DISCH.
02:57:48.330: >> I. TO MAKE 2 POINTS: I DID LOOK BACK AT MY NOTES FROM OUR EXTENSIVE DISCUSSION OF THIS IN JANUARY AND I DO FIND UNEQUIVOCALLY THAT WE WERE SAYING THE PARKING LOT WHICH SHOULD NOT BE A PARKING LOT NEEDS TO BE TORN UP. THAT'S WHAT WE SAID IN JANUARY. SO THAT'S NOT HAPPENED AND WHAT'S PROPOSEDDED IS TO HAVE A RAISED PLANTER AND USE THE REST AS A PATIO WHICH I'M NOT SURE HOW MANY MONTHS WOULD BE USE AS A PATIO BUT WHEN IT'S COLD AND NO ONE'S SITTING ON IT IT'S STILL GOING TO BE A PARKING SPACE. AND THERE WAS A REFERENCE TO THE INTENT OF COUNCIL WHEN THEY CREATED THIS AND I WANT TO ON THE TO THE ARGUMENT THAT THERE ARE TWO HANDLES REGARDING CURB CUTS AND THERE IS A LANGUAGE OF MAXIMUM OF TWO CURB CUTS AND THEN THERE IS THE PROVISION THAT A USELESS CURB CUT SHOULD BE REMOVED. SO IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT -- I MEAN, I DON'T THINK THAT ONE CAN STATE THAT ONLY ONCE A THIRD CURB CUT IS REN RENDERED USELESS THAT IT'S REMOVED. AND THAT'S NOT WHAT WE HAVE. SO I'M NOT GOING TO SUPPORT THERE EITHER.
02:59:28.530: >> COMMISSIONER SAUVE.
02:59:31.433: >> YES. FOR ALL OF THAT. THE OTHER THING I'M CURIOUS FROM STAFF HOW TO CALCULATE PARKING BECAUSE THE OTHER ITEM IN THE PU D IS MAXIMUM OF TEN AND SIMILAR TO CURB CUTS, THERE'S A FEW GARAGES AND CARPORTS BUT THEN WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT AERIAL VIEWS THE WHOLE SERIES OF PARALLEL PARKED CARS IN GRAVEL DRIVES ON DIFFERENT LOTS, NOT THIS LOT. SO I GUESS I'M CURIOUS HOW AND WHEN DOES PARKING GET CALCULATED TO SEE IF WE'RE AT TWO OR TEN, BECAUSE IN MY MIND WE HAVE TWO ELSEWHERE BUT FOR THIS PUD HOW YOU CALCULATE THIS PARKING TO EVALUATE IF WE'RE BETWEEN TWO AND TEN.
03:00:38.199: >> THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION BECAUSE AGAIN IN SOME OF THE WAYS THAT THE PUD WAS WRITTEN IT WAS A CONCEPT PLAN SO IT DIDN'T -- I THINK IDEALLY YOU WALK AROUND THE SITE THERE'S GRAVEL, IT'S NOT A SET PARKING AREA SO THAT WAS AGAIN THROUGH A BUILD-OUT. SO IF THEY WERE TO -- IF YOU WALK THERE TODAY THEY PROBABLY HAVE TEN SPACES. AND IT HAVE TEN SPACES FOR THE ENTIRE DISTRICT, SO WHEN BY USE. SO I MEAN, WE DIDN'T ASSIGN ONE FOR THIS SO IT'S KIND OF -- LIKE THERE WOULD BE NOTHING THAT PRECLUDES THE RESIDENT OF USING THE OTHER SPACES IN THAT DISTRICT, AND WHEN THE,UD, THAT WOULD BE THE MUCH BECAUSE WE WANTED TO LOCK THAT IN. SO WHAT WE HAVEN'T CALCULATED I HAVEN'T GONE BACK IN AND CALCULATED OUT WHERE THE OTHER PARRING -- HOW THAT RELATES TO THIS. I'M NOT SURE THAT FULLY ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION BUT WE DID GO INTO THAT ANALYSIS OF THE PARKING.
03:02:07.021: >>> I THINK IT'S LIKE ARE WE LOOKING AMOUNT THIS RELATIVE TO SITE B? ARE WE THEN LOOKING AT A, B, C, D WITH,UD REGULATIONS. BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF -- SO DO WE GET STRICT ON THE WHOLE DISTRICT OR ARE WE LOOKING AT SITE B AND THE ASPECTS OF THE SPECIAL USE AND SITE PLAN SOMETHING?
03:02:44.926: >> I THINK IT'S A GOOD QUESTION. I WANT TO ECHO SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT MR. MONZEL MADE THE LANGUAGE THAT WAS ADOPTED BY THE COUNSEL REFERENCED SITE PLAN AND THAT'S -- THAT MEANS SOMETHING. ON THIS CASE NOT ONLY CONFRONTS WITH OUR CODE BUT CONSISTENT WITH STATE LAW A SIDE PLAN HAS TO ACCOMPANY THE GRANTING OF A SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE PERMIT SO IN THAT CASE WE ONLY CONSIDERED THE SITE PLAN FOR THE SPECIAL WHOLE SE. USEEOT LOOK AT THE THAT W AN OREGOITEN O PA WE DIDT LOO AT REMOVING TH SPO ASMPACNGHAT BEUSE WE DIDN'T ENVISION IT POSSIBLE AN APPROPRIATE PARKING SPOT. DOES THAT HELP?
03:04:00.001: >> THAT HELP AS BIT. AND FROM MY MIND IF THERE'S A FUTURE MORE INTENSE DEVELOPMENT THAT REDUCES PARKING EVEN MORE IT MAKES EVEN MORE OBVIOUS THE REASON TO GET RID OF THE ONE PARKING SPOT WE'RE DISCUSS RIGHT NOW. I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE SPENDING OUR TIME TALKING ABOUT ONE CURB CUT FOR ONE PARKING SPOT ESPECIALLY WHEN WHAT WE'RE SEEING WITH CURBSIDE PICKUP. I CAN SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE DRIVING UP TO THIS CURB AND USING IT AS A DROP OFF. I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS.
03:04:41.709: >> ANY OTHER QUESTIONS? AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE WHAT I -- SO THE ASK FOR EVER BEFORE US IS THE AMEND THE ORIGINAL CASA DOMINICK'S REGULATIONS ON THE IDEA THAT THERE CAN BE A MAXIMUM OF TWO CURB CUTS. THAT IS THE -- IT WOULD TRIKE THAT EFFECTIVELY IS THE PROPOSAL, YES MR. LENART? APART FROM THIS THAT'S THE ACTION BEFORE US?
03:05:16.344: >> [INDISCERNIBLE].
03:05:17.011: >> AND ACTUALLY -- AGAIN THE QUESTION IS THE REVISION EIGHT IT WILL.
03:05:29.390: >>> TRYING TO FIGURE OUT.
03:05:33.161: >> RIGHT NOW THE REGULATIONS A A -- AM I BACK?
03:05:50.978: >> YOU'RE BACK. GO FOR IT.
03:05:59.921: >> WE CAN HEAR YOU NOW.
03:06:02.890: >> THANK YOU. SO ETCH WAS NOT AID PROVED TONIGHT I THINK GO TO COUNCIL SO WHAT THE PETITIONER HAS PROPOSED IS ACTUALLY THAT STRIKEOUT VERSION SAYS FOUR CURB CUTS NOW AND IN STRIKEOUT VERSE IT'S PROPOSE FOUR CURB CUTS WHEN THE ORIGINAL WAS THREE. SO I WAS A LITTLE COB FUSEs BY THAT CHANGE BUT WHAT THAT I PROPOSING UNTIL TENTATIVELY THE CURB CUT UNTIL THERE'S A SITE PLAN THAT INVOLVES 700 TAPPANED THATGGER THE REMOVAL OF THAT CURB CUT FOR THAT AREA. SO THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE PROPOSING IS TO DELAY THAT UNTIL A MAJOR REDEVELOPMENTS WOULD TRIGGER A SITES PLAN FOR THAT AREA. BUT THE THERE'S A COUPLE OTHER CHAIN -- CHANGES AND BASIC THE LANGUAGE PRIOR TO A BECOMING PERMS BEING ISSUED IN AREAS B OR C THAT THEY WOULD REMOVE THAT CURB CUT BUT THAT INVOLVES 700 TAPPAN AND THE ADJACENT PARCEL BUT THAT IS THE PROPOSED CHANGE TO DELAY THAT UNTIL A SITE PLAN -- AREAS B OR C IS SUBMITTED AND THEN THE PRIOR TO THAT THE CURB CUT WOULD BE ELIMINATED WITH -- WELL DOESN'T IT SAY REMOVED BUT WE WOULD MAKE THEM REMOVE THE IMPERIOUS. AND IN ADDITION THEY WOULD ADD IN THE REQUIREMENT OF THE RAIN GARDEN. SO REALLY THE ONLY CHANGES ARE REGARDING THOSE CURB CUTS AND THE ADDITION OF THAT RAIN GARDEN.
03:08:25.666: >> ESPECIALLY AS DRAFTED, ESPECIALLY CAN INCREASING THE NUMBER OF CURB CUTS I CANNOT SUPPORT THIS. SO ANY OTHER COMMENTS? MR. MONZEL, GO AHEAD.
03:08:43.117: >> I JUST WANTED TO RESPOND BRIEFLY TO SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE. IF YOU LOOK AT THE DRAWING WHAT I TRIED TO DO IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS IS DOMINICK'S HAS BEEN THERE FOR LONER THAN I'VE BEEN IN TOWN. PROBABLY LONGER THAN MOST OF YOU. IT OPERATES -- THE LOADER AREA FOR THE RESTAURANT IS IN THE SOUTHWEST PART OF DRAWING A PARTS A, SO RICH IS GOING TO KEEP THE CURB CUT ON OAKLAND WHICH IS NEAR THE LETTER D CAN RECOLLECT PEOPLE -- THE DELIVERY TRUCKS COME IN AND ACCESS MONROE STREETS ON THE NORTHWEST CORNER OF A AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT HE PROPOSED TO CITY COUNCIL BUT WHY THERE'S A EVERY MORNING TO ONLY TWO CURB CUTS. WHAT I TRIED TO DO IS CLEAN THIS UP AND SO THE LANGUAGE FROM THE EXISTING SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS WHILE IT DOES REFER TO THE CURB CUTS IT GIVES THE TIMING FOR WHEN -- THAT'S WHAT WE BELIEVE THE CITY COUNCIL'S INTENT WAS. I LOGBOOKED AT ALL THE MATERIALS SO WE ARE QUEER IT'S QUITETH QUITE COMFORTABLE IN THE CONCLUSION THAT CITY COUNCIL INTENDED DOMINICK'S IF YOU TO FUNCTION. SO THEY KNEW THAT THERE WOULD BE THOSE TWO CURB CUTS AND HE SAID HEY I MAY EVENTUALLY DO THIS DEVELOPMENTS IN WHICH CASE THE EASTERN CURB CUT ON MONROE AND THE SOUTHEASTERN CURB CUT ON TAPPAN WOULD BE THE ONES THAT WOULD BE WE MOVED BUT THE POINT OF THE LANGUAGE WAS THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO BE REMOVED UNTIL THE FIRST PUD SITE PLAN WAS APPROVED FOR THE DISTRICT. NOW, MR. LENART AND MR. KOWALSKI WILL CONFIRM THAT IN ORDER TO DO CONSTRUCTION YOU HAVE TO HAVE A SITE PLAN AND I'M PRETTY SURE OF THIS TOO THAT THE MARIJUANA DISPENSARY ISSUE, THE STATE LAW AND CITY COUNCIL STATE ORDINANCE NOT WITH SUBSTANTIATING THAT'S THE FIRST TIME WHEN YOU HAD TO PROVIDE A SIDE PLAN WITHOUT CONSTRUCTION. SO WHEN THE CITY COUNCIL PASSED THIS PUD BACK THIS 2009, THE IDEA IS HEY THE TRIGGER IS THE SITE PLAN APPLICATION, IT'S NOT THE PERMIT, IT'S NOT THE CO, THAT'S THE SITE PLAN, SO CITY COUNCIL WOULD HAVE BEEN THINKING EASTBOUND WHEN THEY ACTUALLY DO THE DEVELOPMENT, SO I DON'T THINK IT'S UNFAIR AT ALL TO SAY THAT CITY COUNCIL SAID HEY WE'RE APPROVING THE CONCEPT PLAN WHEN MR. DEVARDI PROCEEDS HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE OUT THE CURTAIN CUTS.
03:12:12.493: >> THANK YOU.
03:12:14.161: >> SO WHAT I TRIED TO DO WAS REFLECT THE REALITY. LET'S FACE IT. THE SIDE PLAN HAS BEEN APPROVED SINCE 2009 AND THERE HASN'T -- THOSE CURB CUTS HAVE ALL BEEN THERE BUT JUST BRIEFLY ON A COUPLE OTHER POSSIBLIES ONE I KNOW McLEOD HAS WORKED AT NO PARKING THERE TEMPERATURE PLANTERS ARE ACTUALLY A BETTER SOLUTION AN REMOVING THE PAYMENT. EVEN IF THE PAYMENT WAS GONE YOU MIGHT HAVE PEOPLE DRIVE UP ON THAT CURB CUT SO WE TRIED TO ADDRESS HOW TO STOP USING PEOPLE FROM DOING THAT.
03:13:49.557: >>> ANY OTHER COMMENTS? ALL RIGHT. MR. LEONARD WE CAN DO A ROLE CALL VOTE.

03:17:30.177: >> YES ATTACH SO THE CURRENT MEETING SCHEDULE. I WOULD LIKE TO CONSIDER MOVES TO MOVE YOUR OCTOBER 12 MEETING TO OCTOBER 13. THE REASON FOR THAT IS IS THAT MONDAY IS INDIGENOUS PEOPLES DAY THAT. MEANS CITY COUNCIL IS MOVING TO THE TUESDAY. IT'S NOT SOMETHING WE PICK UP SO I WOULD LIKE TO PROPOSE THE WORKING SESSION TO THAT WEDNESDAY THE 13TH.
03:17:59.039: >> CAN I HAVE A MOTION, MOVED BY COMMISSIONER WYCHE. SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER SAUVE. ANY DISCUSSION. ALL IN FAVOR PLEASE RAISE YOUR HAND OR SAY YES. WAS THAT A QUICK HAND COMMISSIONER LEE? YES. THAT'S EVERYBODY. SORRY I I WASN'T CATCHING YOU QUICK ENOUGH. ITEM 12 IS -- COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL.

THERE IS SOMEBODY WHO'S JOINED THROUGH ZOOM. FUND LIKE TO PROVIDE A PUBLIC COMMENT PLEASE USE THE RAISE HAND FEATURE TO INDICATE THAT NOW.
03:19:35.802: >> SEE NO INDICATION.
03:19:38.505: >>> THEN WE'LL MOVE ON TO ITEM 13 WHICH IS COMMISSION PROPOSED BUSINESS. IS THERE ANY? I'M GOING TO DO THIS AND I ALWAYS DO AND I THINK ALL THE DISCUSSION OVER THE MILL CREEK ARE POLINGS SUGGESTIONS THAT NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENED WE NEED TO REVISIT THE EV ORDINANCE BECAUSE THE IDEA THAT YOU DO NOT NEED TO PUT,V STRUCTURE ON EXTRA PARKING, THAT IT'S ONLY REQUIRED ON THE REQUIRED PARKING IS EXTREMELY PROBLEMATIC IN MY MIND AS PEOPLE -- I EVER BEEN PUSHING IN OUR REWRITING OF PARKING TO ADD AN ADDITIONAL -- TO REQUIRE EV INFRASTRUCTURE ON ANYTHING THAT YOU BUILD. BE EVEN THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT INTO OUR OVERALL PARKING CHANGES THIS IS A QUICK FIX THAT WE NEED TO DEFT NOT HAVE THAT JUST APPLY TO REQUIRED PARKING.
03:21:01.922: >> IT'S NOT PARKING SECTION SO I DON'T THINK IT'S AN UNAPPROPRIATE TIME FULL NAME FULL NAME TO ADDRESS IT .
03:21:41.795: >>> IT'S TOO MUCHT TO SYNTHESIZE TO TO BE ABLE TO SEE IT VISUALLY WOULD BE HE HELP. BECAUSE I'M STRUGGLING WITH HOW WE'RE INTENDING TO MEET OUR HOUSING GOALS IF WE HAVE TOP OF SO MUCH THE LAND USE BE DEDICATED TO PARKING. IT ACTUALLY FEELS FARCICAL. IA FULL THIRD OF OUR LAND USE FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND IS DEDICATED TO CAR STORAGE. SO JUST HELPING FIR THAT OUT AS WE LOOK AT THESE NEW DEVELOPMENTS AND WITH THIS INFILL PROJECT THIS IS ANOTHER 50 YEAR DEVELOPMENT THAT WE WON'T HAVE ANY INPUT ON AND THE ESTIMATES FOR ERICV VEHICLES THAT BY 2030 A FULL THIRD OF ALL NEW CARS WILL BE ELECTRIFIED. SO WHILE TODAY WE'RE ONLY AT 3.4 PERCENT THE ESTIMATES TO GET THE FLEET TO MEET THE GAS REDUCTION, SORRY I'M GOING TO STOP LOSING MY ACCESS TOE WORDS EMISSION REDUCTION IS GOING TO GO THROUGH THE ELECTRIFICATION OF OUR FLEET. SO I DO WANT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BALANCE WHAT COMMISSIONER DISCH SAID AND TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION WHAT COMMISSIONER LEE TALKED ABOUT. SO IT JUST FEELS UNNECESSARILY COMPLICATED I THINK IS THE WAY THAT I WOULD DESCRIBE IT AND SO I DON'T KNOW IS THERE A WAY -- IS IT ONLY IN SUBCOMMITTEE THAT HE WITH TALK ABOUT THIS? ARE THERE OTHER CONVERSATIONS WHERE WE HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS AROUND HOW WE'RE GOING TO ADDRESS OUR PLANNING OBJECTIVES ESPECIALLY AS IT RELATES TOES E2 ZERO. S.
03:24:19.386: >> DO YOU WANT MR. LENART TO GO FIRST COMMISSIONER DISCH. MR. LENART.
03:24:28.295: >> I THINK THOSE ARE GREAT QUESTIONS, ECONOMIESER WYCHE. AS WAS I THINK THE I IT IS THIS HAVE WAS A GREAT EXAMPLE. I THINK ONE OF THE POLICY DECISIONS THAT YOU AND THE CITY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO COME TO IS I THINK FRANKLY THE HEAVY HANDED NECESSARY OF THAT BALANCE, A LOT OF COMING UPS T COMMUNITIES ARE DOING THIS. IF SOMEBODY FROM A MARKET RATE PERSPECTIVE THINKS THEY CAN FUNCTION TO THAT LEVEL WHY WOULD WE SAY NO WE ARE FORCING YOU TO CONTRIBUTE TO THAT. SO I THIS I DON'T WANT TO SAY IT'S EASY TO SAY NO MINIMUM IS REQUIRED. I THINK THE MORE SIGNIFICANT POLICY DECISION IS THE MAXIMUM SIDE OF THINGS, AND SO TONIGHT IS A GOOD EXAMPLE WHERE YOU HAVE A PROPERTY OWNER SAYING THAT IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THIS INFO I NEED MORE PARKING THAN THE MINIMUM. SO THE CITY COWL COULD GET TO A POLICY FRAMEWORK THAT SAYS NO WE'RE GOING TO PRESCRIBE MAXIMUMS BUT I THINK THE POLICY DECISION THERE IS THAT YOU MIGHT VERY WELL HAVE PROPERTY OWNERS IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE AND I'M UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THAT INVESTMENT AND MY MARKETABLE BY MIGHT BE LAGGING THE CITY'S ASPIRATIONS. SO I WANT TO SAY THAT THAT IS ABSOLUTELY APROPOS FOR THIS BECOMING DISCUSSION AND GENERALLY ONE OF THE THE THINGS WE DIDN'T GET TO IS WE HAVE A SERIOUS OF SUBCOMMITTEES ON THIS GROUP AND ONE OF THEM IS THE ORDINANCE GROUP AND THEY HELP STAFF WITH THE FOR FOR NUTS AND BOLTS OF CRAFTING LANGUAGE TO READY IT FOR PRESENTATION TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION, BUT WITH SOMETHING LIKE PARKING WE HAVE PUT TOGETHER A WORK PLAN IN THAT REGARD BUT WE MIGHT DECIDE THAT WARNS WORKING SESSION CONVERSATIONS RATHER THAN WAITING IT TO BE [INDISCERNIBLE] SO I HOPE THAT HELPS RESPONDING TO SOME OF THOSE QUESTIONS.
03:27:10.423: >> THANK YOU AND THE ONLY OTHER THING WHICH WOULD BE HELPFUL AND WE CAN TALK OFFLINE IS A PROCESS STANDPOINT. DOES ITS ORIGINATE IN PLANNING CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY COMMISSION AND DO TO COUNCIL OR DOES ITS ORANGE NATE IN COUNCIL AND COMES TO PLANNING COMMISSION AND ARE THERE PROTOCOLS WHEN COUNSEL PICKS UP A PUBLIC HEARING WE HAVE ALREADY DISCUSS ED?
03:27:58.738: >> ?
03:27:58.905: >>.
03:28:02.308: >> JUST DO SAY BOTH OF THESE THINGS HAPPEN. WE HAVE OUR OWN WORK PLAN AND HONESTLY PARKING HAS BEEN ON THERE FOR YEARS BUT IT'S BEEN IF ONE THING THAT'S BEEN REALLY HARD AND WE DECIDED WE CAN'T
