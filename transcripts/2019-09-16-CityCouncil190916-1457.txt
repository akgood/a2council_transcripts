00:01:33.318: >> City Admin. Lazarus: I WANT TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO A FEW ITEMS. THERE'S A SUMMARY OF THE ONGOING ACTIVITIES AROUND THE SMART CITIES INITIATIVE WHICH IS PROVIDED AS AN ATASCHMENT. THE SUSTAINABILITY INNOVATION OFFICE IS HOSTING TWO FREE POWER HOURS INVITING RESIDENTS TO LEARN MORE ABOUT IMPROVING THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY OF THEIR HOMES. IT'S OCTOBER 17th AT 6 P.M. AND DECEMBER 3rd AT THE WEST GATE LIBRARIY AT 7 P.M. OUR WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLAN STAFF ASKED HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE WATER AFTER THEY FLUSH OR IT GOES DOWN THE DRAIN. THEY HAVE AN OPEN HOUSE FROM SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 21st FROM 11 A.M. TO 3 P.M. IT'S LOCATED AT 49 OLD DICKSBOROUGH ROAD. ALL ARE WELCOME.

THERE ARE THREE MEETINGS SUNDAY, OCTOBER 6th BETWEEN 2 AND 4 P.M. AT THE WEST GATE BRANCH LIBRARY; THURSDAY, OCTOBER 10th BETWEEN 6 AND 8 P.M. AT THE TRAVERWOOD BRANCH LIBRARY; AND SATURDAY, OCTOBER 12th BETWEEN 9:30 AND 11:30 AT THE MALAZ CREEK BRANCH. CHILDREN ARE WELCOME. LIGHT REFRESHMENTS WILL BE THERE. THEY ARE ADDRESSING THE ONE COMMUNITY AND THE ONGOING DIVERSITY EQUITY AND INCLUSION EFFORTS AND OUR MONTHLY CROSSWALK IMPROVEMENTS MEMO IS PROVIDED AS WELL. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK OFFICER ELDERS FOR PROVIDING SUPPORT THIS EVENING. AT THIS POINT, I WANT TO TURN THE FLOOR OVER TO MR. FORNIER TO GIVE A VERY BRIEF OVERVIEW ON -- OR UPDATE ON ACTIONS RELATED TO COUNCIL CLEAN AND RENEWABLE ENERGY DIRECTION.
00:03:33.272: >> THANK YOU. HI, I'M JOHN FORNIER, THE ASSISTANT CITY ADMINISTRATOR. IN THE INTEREST OF TIME, I WILL TRY TO KEEP THIS BRIEF BUT I WANTED TO FOLLOW UP ON COMMUNICATION I SENT TO COUNCIL IN MAY, PROVIDING A PROJECT STAFF HAS BEEN UNDERTAKING AT THE LANDFILL IN THE WHEELER CENTER. WE ENGAGED IN A STUDY WITH D.T.E. TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF A SOLAR INSTALLATION, SOLAR-GENERATING INSTALLATION AT THAT FACILITY. WE WORKED THROUGH THE SUMMER WITH D.T.E. ON THAT PROJECT, AND THE PRELIMINARY RESULTS SHOW THAT A 20 TO 25 MEGAWATTS SOLAR FACILITY IS TECHNICALLY FEASIBLE ON THAT PROPERTY. SO I WANTED TO MAKE COUNCIL AWARE FIRST OF ALL, OF THAT RESULT, AND FOLLOW-UP ON THAT COMMUNICATION. BUT ALSO LET YOU KNOW THAT AS PART OF THE PRELIMINARY WORK WE'RE DOING ON THIS PROJECT, WE'RE SUBMITTING A PUD AMEND TO PITTSFIELD TOWNSHIP WHICH WOULD ALLOW US TO HAVE GROUND-MOUNTED SOLAR IN THE PUD ZONE AT THE WHEELER CENTER. THE WHEELER CENTER, OF COURSE IS OWNED BY THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR BUT IT IS IN PITTSFIELD TOWNSHIP AND SUBJECT TO THEIR ZONING. SO WE ANTICIPATE SUBMITTING THAT PUD AMENDMENT AT SOME POINT THIS WEEK OR NEXT. I WANT TO MAKE YOU AWARE OF THAT, IN CASE YOU RECEIVE QUESTIONS. WHEN WE FINALIZE THE PUD AMENDMENT AND SUBMIT IT, WE WILL, OF COURSE, COMMUNICATE A COPY OF IT TO COUNCIL SO YOU CAN REVIEW IT. I JUST WANT TO SAY, ALSO BRIEFLY THAT WE'RE VERY MUCH AT THE BEGINNING STAGES OF THIS PROJECT. WE HAVEN'T, OBVIOUSLY ENTERED INTO ANY AGREEMENTS AS NOTHING HAS COME BEFORE COUNCIL. WE HAVEN'T EXPENDED ANY MONEY BUT THERE'S A LOT OF ENTHUSIASM FOR IT, BOTH ON STAFF AND WITH D.T.E. AS THE PROJECT MOVES FORWARD, WE WILL, OF COURSE, KEEP CITY COUNCIL CLOSELY INFORMED. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, ALWAYS HAPPY TO COMMUNICATE VIA EMAIL. YOU CAN CALL ME. HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. WHATEVER YOU WOULD LIKE.
00:05:30.422: >> City Admin. Lazarus: WE'RE DONE.
00:05:31.890: >> Mayor Taylor: EXCELLENT. WE COME TO A SET OF INTRODUCTIONS. MAY I HAVE THE PEOPLE HERE FOR RECOGNITION OF CONSTITUTION WEEK, PLEASE MEET ME UP FRONT. THANK YOU.
00:05:54.613: >> THANK YOU.
00:05:55.414: >> Mayor Taylor: SO AS WE HAVE FOR MANY YEARS NOW, WE ARE RECOGNIZING -- WE ARE RECOGNIZING CONSTITUTION WEEK. WE DO NOT RECOGNIZE CONSTITUTION WEEK BECAUSE THE CONSTITUTION AS IT WAS DRAFTED BACK IN 1789 WAS PERFECT. INDEED, IT WAS FAR FROM IT. IT COUNTENANCE AND SUPPORTED THE ENSLAVEMENT OF PERSONS. IT MADE NO PROVISIONS FOR -- FOR PROTECTION OF PERSONS ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR SEX. IT HAD WITHIN IT BUNDLED MANY COUNTERMAJORTARIAN AND THE INDIRECT ELECTION OF SENATORS WHICH TO OUR EYE TODAY WOULD BE SHOCKING. BUT NEVERTHELESS, IT IS -- IT PROVIDES TO US THE STRUCTURE OF GOVERNMENT. IT PROVIDES TO US A STRUCTURE OF GOVERNMENT, WHICH OVER THE YEARS HAS EVOLVED. AND IT HAS BROUGHT TO US TODAY A SOCIETY WHICH ALTHOUGH NOT PERFECT, NEVERTHELESS EMBODIES MANY OF OUR ASPIRATIONS. IT DOES NOT MEET THEM ALL BUT IT DOES EMBODY MANY. THOSE RIGHTS AND LIBERTIES AND FREEDOMS WE HAVE FOUND IN OUR CONSTITUTION AND WE ENFORCE THEM THROUGH OUR CONSTITUTION. IT HAS CREATED AF A FORM OF GOVERNMENT THAT WE ARE WORKING EVERYDAY TO MAKE MORE PERFECT. AND WE ARE THANKFUL AND GRATEFUL FOR A BETTER DAY. AND SO IN THAT LIGHT, I WOULD LIKE TO RECOGNIZE CONSTITUTION WEEK. WHEREAS SEPTEMBER 17, 2019, MARKS THE 232nd ANNIVERSARY OF THE DRAFTING OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, BY THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION, AND WHEREAS IT IS FITTING AND PROPER TO OFFICIALLY RECOGNIZE THIS ENDURING DOCUMENT AND THE ANNIVERSARY OF ITS CREATION. AND WHEREAS IT IS FITTING AND PROPER TO ENCOURAGE, SUPPORT, AND RECOGNIZE THE PATRIOTIC CELEBRATIONS WHICH WILL COMMEMORATE THE OCCASION. AND WHEREAS PUBLIC LAW 915 LAW GUARANTEES THE ISSUING OF A PROCLAMATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, DESIGNATED SEPTEMBER 13 TO 23rd AS CONSTITUTION WEEK. FOUL I CHRISTOPHER TA TAKE -- N, I CHRISTOPHER TAYLOR, MAYOR OF ANN ARBOR, URGE THIS WEEK TO BE CONSTITUTIONAL WEEK. AND I URGE ALL CITIZENS TO TAKE NOTE OF THE OBSERVANCE. [ APPLAUSE ]
00:08:11.716: >> THANK YOU, MAYOR TAYLOR. AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR GRACIOUSNESS IN ISSUING THIS PROCLAMATION. I ALSO WANT TO THANK JANE LUMM, COUNCILMEMBER FOR SECOND WARD. SHE HAS BEEN VERY HELPFUL IN ARE ASSISTING US IN COORDINATING THIS. BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION, I'M SHARON CLARK. I'M MEMBER OF THE DAUGHTERS OF THE AMERICAS REVOLUTION. AS ITS MISSION, D.A.R. ACTIVELY PROMOTES PATRIOTISM, PRESERVING AMERICAN HISTORY, AND SECURING AMERICA'S FUTURE THROUGH BETTER EDUCATION OF OUR CHILDREN. WE SPONSOR SCHOLARSHIPS, EDUCATIONAL INITIATIVES, SERVICE TO VETERANS, COMMUNITY SERVICE, AND COMMEMORATIVE EVENTS SUCH AS CONSTITUTION WEEK. AS WE KNOW OUR COUNTRY HAS TWO FOUNDATIONAL DOCUMENTS, THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE, AND THE CONSTITUTION. THE COUNTRY HAS CELEBRATED THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE DAY, JULY 4th, EVER SINCE EARLY TIMES, DURING THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR. BUT THIS WAS NO SPECIAL COMMEMORATION OF SEPTEMBER 17th, THE DAY THE DELEGATES TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION SIGNED THE CONSTITUTION. IN 1955, THE DAUGHTERS OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION PETITIONED CONGRESS TO DECLARE SEPTEMBER 17th THROUGH THE 23rd AS CONSTITUTION WEEK. CONGRESS ADOPTED THE RESOLUTION, AND PRESIDENT EISENHOWER SIGNED IT INTO LAW THE FOLLOWING YEAR. SINCE THEN, PRESIDENTS, MAYORS, GOVERNORS, HAVE ISSUED PROCLAMATIONS CELEBRATING THIS WEEK. OUR CONSTITUTION HAS ENDURED FOR 232 YEARS, IN CONTRAST, THE AVERAGE LIFE SPAN OF NATIONAL CONSTITUTIONS WORLDWIDE IS 19 YEARS AND THIS IS ACCORDING TO CONSTITUTIONAL SCHOLARS. THAT MEANS WE HAVE LIVED UNDER THE SAME WRITTEN CONSTITUTION LONGER THAN ANY PEOPLE ON EARTH. WE HAVE HAD REGULAR FEDERAL ELECTIONS EVERY TWO YEARS SINCE RATIFICATION, EVEN THROUGH A CIVIL WAR, TWO WORLD WARS, GREAT DEPRESSION, SOCIAL UPHEAVAL AND THE TERRORIST ATTACKS OF 9/11. SO WHY HAS OUR CONSTITUTION ENDURED WHEN OTHERS HAVE COME AND GONE? WELL, THERE ARE SEVERAL REASONS. THE FIRST IS IT'S A STATEMENT OF FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF GOVERNMENT WITH RESTRAINTS, BUT IT ALSO ALLOWS FOR INNOVATION. MAYOR TAYLORMAYOR TAYLOR MENTIOF THESE CHANGES OF THE ORIGINAL LANGUAGE. AMENDING THE CONSTITUTION IS DIFFICULT BUT NOT IMPOSSIBLE. MANY AMENDMENTS HAVE BEEN PROPOSED BUT ONLY 27 HAVE BEEN PASSED. SECOND, OUR CONSTITUTION WAS THE WORLD'S FIRST ENSHRINING SELF-GOVERNANCE. WE THE PEOPLE CHOOSE OUR LEADERS RATHER THAN INHERITING A MONARCH OR HAVING A DICTATOR IMPOSED ON US. THIRD, OUR CULTURE OF RESPECT FOR THE CONSTITUTION CONTINUES TO GIVE LIFE TO A DOCUMENT WRITTEN 232 YEARS AGO. LOYALTY TO THE CONSTITUTION, HOWEVER ONE CHOOSEs TO DEFINE IT, IS AN ENDURING FEATURE OF AMERICAN LIFE. IN CLOSING, LET'S REMEMBER THE WORDS OF THE PREAMBLE TO THE CONSTITUTION. WE THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES, IN ORDER TO FORM A MORE PERFECT UNION, ESTABLISH JUSTICE, ENSURE DOMESTIC TRANQUILITY, PROVIDE FOR THE COMMON DEFENSE, PROMOTE THE GENERAL WELFARE AND SECURE THE BLESSINGS OF LIBERTY TO OURSELVES AND OUR POSTERITY, DO ORDAIN AND ESTABLISH THIS CONSTITUTION FOR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. SO THIS EVENING, LET'S CELEBRATE THE CONSTITUTION AND ASK OUR FELLOW CITIZENS OF ANN ARBOR TO JOIN US IN CELEBRATING IT THROUGHOUT CONSTITUTION WEEK. THANK YOU. [ APPLAUSE ]
00:12:45.523: >> Mayor Taylor: ALL RIGHT. GOOD. YOU KNOW, WE -- WHAT HAS ALSO BECOME A -- YOU KNOW, SOMETHING THAT MARKS THE BEGINNING OF SEPTEMBER, MARKS SEPTEMBER, WE ARE HERE TODAY TO RECOGNIZE AND CELEBRATE RECOVERY MONTH. FOLKS IN ANN ARBOR, FOLKS WHO SUFFER FROM ADDICTION, THEIR FAMILIES, ALL TOO OFTEN, THEY SUFFER ALONE AND IN FEAR FOR WANT OF SUPPORT AND ASSISTANCE. AND ONE OF THE BENEFITS AND THE GREAT THINGS ABOUT RECOGNIZING RECOVERY MONTH IS TO ENSURE OUR RESIDENTS AND FOLKS IN ANN ARBOR THAT THERE ARE SUPPORT SERVICES AVAILABLE. THERE ARE PEOPLE HERE TO HELP AND THAT RECOVERY IS, INDEED POSSIBLE AND IT IS THEREFORE MY -- MY DELIGHT TO PROCLAIM SEPTEMBER NATIONAL RECOVERY MONTH. SEPTEMB IS, INDEED, NATIONAL RECOVERY MONTH AND WHEREAS ADDICTION IS A MAJOR NATIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE AFLICKING THOSE WHO SUFFER, THEIR FAMILIES, LOVED ONES AND THEIR COMMUNITIES. AND WHEREAS, RECOVERY IS A REALITY FOR MILLIONS OF RESILIENT AMERICANS WHOSE LIVES HAVE BEEN TRANSFORMED AS A RESULT. THE 2013 LIFE AND RECOVERY SURVEY CONCLUDED AS FOLLOWS: THE DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH RECOVERY AFFECTED ALL AREAS OF LIFE, INCLUDING A TENFOLD DECREASE IN THE USE OF THE CRIMINAL SYSTEM, AND DECREASE IN HOSPITAL USE AND. AND WHEREAS, RECOVERY FROM ADDICTION FLOURISHED IN SUPPORT OF RECOVERY-FRIENDLY COMMUNITY AND WHEREAS ANN ARBOR IS A RECOVERY-FRIENDLY COMMUNITY THAT IS HOME TO A VIBRANT, DIVERSE AND THRIVING RECOVERING COMMUNITY, A MODEL OF RECOVERY-OTHERRENTED SYSTEM OF CARE -- ORIENTED SYSTEM OF CARE, A COLLEGIATE RECOVERY PROGRAM AND MANY DEDICATED PROFESSIONALS WHO HELP PEOPLE INITIATE AND MAINTAIN RECOVERIES. AND WHEREAS, PROCLAIMING SEPTEMBER 2019 AS RECOVERY MONTH, SERVES TO APPLAUD THOSE WHO ARE IN RECOVERY, THINK FAMILY THERES LOVED ONES AND COMMUNITY THAT SUPPORTS THEM, PROVIDING HOPE TO THOSE WHO STILL SUFFER AND AFFIRMING OUR SHARED BELIEF IN REDEMPTION AND IN SECOND CHANCES. NOW, THEREFORE, I CHRISTOPHER TAYLOR, MAYOR OF ANN ARBOR, MICHIGAN, DO PROCLAIM SEPTEMBER 2019 AS RECOVERY MONTH AND INVITE RESIDENTS OF ANN ARBOR TO SUPPORT THOSE IN RECOVERY AND THE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES DESIGNED TO HELP THOSE IN NEED.
00:15:00.558: >> ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU. [ APPLAUSE ]
00:15:07.799: >> THANK YOU, MAYOR TAYLOR, MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL. MY NAME IS SAM. I'M A PERSON IN LONG-TERM CELEBRECOVERY. THAT MEANS I HAVE NOT FOUND A NEED TO TAKE A DRINK OR A DRUG IN OVER SEVEN YEARS AND IT ALSO MEANS THAT I HAVE BEEN AFFORDED SOME OPPORTUNITIES AND BENEFITS AS A RESULT OF MY RECOVERY, SOME OF WHICH INCLUDE STUDYING HERE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN FOR MY M.S.W., HAVING HAD PROFESSIONAL OPPORTUNITIES AROUND THE WORLD AND COUNTRY, WHICH MAKE ME SOMEWHAT QUALIFIED TO SAY THAT THIS IS ONE THE MORE SUPPORTIVE RECOVERY COMMUNITIES THAT I HAVE EVER BEEN A PART OF. I HAVE NEVER BEEN TO A PLACE THAT HAD SUCH A CELEBRATION OF RECOVERY IN PROFESSIONAL OPPORTUNITIES AS WE FIND IN DETROIT FILLING STATION OR REDDINGMAN'S, AND OTHERS WHO HIRE THEM OUT. I CAN STAND UP IN A CITY COUNCIL MEETING AND PROUDLY DECLARE THAT I'M IN RECOVERY AFTER HAVING RECEIVED THIS PROCLAMATION. THAT HAS SERVICES SUCH AS THE RECOVERY COMMUNITY THAT WE MENTIONED AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, BUT THERE'S ALSO TWO MORE AT WASHTENAW COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND EASTERN MICHIGAN UNIVERSITY READILY AVAILABLE, MEANING THAT A STUDENT CAN GET THEIR ASSOCIATE'S, BACHELOR'S MASTER'S AND/OR PH.D. AT THREE SEPARATE UNIVERSITIES AND ALWAYS STAY IN SOME SORT OF INSULATED RECOVERY COMMUNITY. THANKS THAT HAVE MADE MY OWN RECOVERY JOURNEY ENTIRELY POSSIBLE SO THAT I'M ONE OF THOSE STATISTICS THAT WE JUST READ OFF IN THE 50% INCREASE IN FAMILY ACTIVITIES AND NOT ONE OF THOSE STATISTICS OF THE 70,000 PEOPLE A YEAR WHO DIE FROM OPIOID OVERDOSE. OR SIMILARLY RELATED CAUSES. SO YOU KNOW, I STAND UP HERE BEFORE YOU TODAY, ONLY TO SAY THAT THE RECOVERY SERVICES AND SUPPORT IN THIS COMMUNITY ARE EXCELLENT AND YOU OUGHT TO BE PROUD OF THEM. SO THANK YOU. [ APPLAUSE ]
00:17:17.328: >> JUST ONE SECOND. ALL RIGHT. HI. MY NAME IS TEEGAN JOHNSON. ALSO A PERSON IN RECOVERY, AS YOU MIGHT HAVE GUESSED. I HAVE BEEN SOBER -- CLEAN AND SOBER FOR ABOUT SIX AND A HALF YEARS. AND I WAS ASKED HERE TONIGHT TO TALK ABOUT THE RECOVERY COMMUNITY HERE IN ANN ARBOR. SO THANK YOU, MAYOR, AND THANKS, MATT, FOR INVITING ME. I WILL TRY AND BE RELATIVELY BRIEF THIS IS A LOT TO SAY ABOUT THE COMMUNITY HERE. SO I HAVE LIVED HERE IN THE ANN ARBOR AREA FOR ABOUT SEVEN YEARS AND RECOVERY IS WHAT WE BROUGHT ME HERE. ACTUALLY THE POLICE DRAGGED ME HERE BUT I STAYED FOR RECOVERY. BECAUSE OF THE STRENGTH AND DIVERSITY OF ANN ARBOR'S RECOVERY COMMUNITY AND WITH THE HELP OF LOCAL RECOVERY PROGRAMS, THE LIKES OF HOME OF NEW VISION AND DAWN FARM, I WAS ABLE TO RECOVER FROM HEROIN ADDICTION AND BUILD A GOOD SOCIAL SUPPORT SYSTEM AND LEARN HOW TO LIVE A SOBER LIFE. I'M NOT SURE IF PEOPLE REALIZE HOW PROLIFIC THE RECOVERY COMMUNITY IS HERE IN TOWN. I DON'T WANT TO GET TOO FIGHT CLUB WITH IT, BUT WE REALLY ARE EVERYWHERE. MY GIRLFRIEND THINKS THAT I'M REALLY CHARMING AND POPULAR BECAUSE ANY TIME WE GO DOWNTOWN, I RUN INTO TWO OR THREE PEOPLE MINIMUM THAT I KNOW BUT REALLY I USED TO HAVE A DRUG PROBLEM AND THAT GAVE ME AN INTO THIS COMMUNITY AND I RAN WITH IT AND NOW MY LIFE IS FULL OF POSITIVE RELATIONSHIPS. IN 2016, DERRICK WOLF WROTE AN ARTICLE ABOUT THE HEALING FOREST MODEL FOR COMMUNITY-BASED RECOVERY, WHEREIN EVERY MEMBER OF THE COMMUNITY, NOT JUST THOSE DIRECTLY AFFECTED BY ADDICTION HAVE A ROLE IN HELPING FOLKS TO THEIR FEET. THE HEALING FORCE MODEL IS NAMED SO BECAUSE IT'S AKIN TO DIGGING UP A SICK AND DYING TREE AND TRANSPLANTING IT INTO AN ENVIRONMENT OF RICH SOIL, SUNSHINE, WATER. SO IN THE CASE OF ANN ARBOR, INTRODUCING THE ADDICT TO A HEALTHY COMMUNITY WITH AMPLE ACCESS TO TREATMENT, POSITIVE SOCIAL SUPPORT, HOUSING, JOBS, AND EDUCATION. PEOPLE DO COME TO ANN ARBOR FROM ALL OVER TO GET WELL BECAUSE OUR COMMUNITY HAS THAT REPUTATION. IT'S THE PLACE THAT YOU GO TO FIND SUPPORT THAT YOU NEED TO GET AND STAY SOBER. THIS IS A GREAT AND PERHAPS NOT TOO WELL KNOWN FACT ABOUT OUR TOWN AND I WANT EVERYONE TO KNOW ABOUT THE GOOD THINGS HAPPENING LOCALLY. AS A RESULT OF THE SUPPORT I HAVE GOTTEN HERE, I'M ABLE TO BE A POLITICALLY ACTIVE AND ENGAGED COMMUNITY MEMBER WORKING FOR THE BEST INTEREST OF THE PEOPLE AROUND ME. I NOW WORK AT DAWN FARM IN THE ADMISSIONS DEPARTMENT BECAUSE I CARE ABOUT GIVING BACK TO THE COMMUNITY THAT HELPED SAVE MY LIFE. ANN ARBOR IS AN AFFLUENT PLACE AND IT MAKES ME GLAD WHEN I SEE THE RESOURCES AND ENERGY HERE UTILIZED FOR THE HEALING OF OUR COMMUNITY. I HOPE THAT OUR COMMUNITY WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE VULNERABLE AMONG US AND PUT THE RESOURCES HERE TO WORK IN THE SERVICE OF THE PEOPLE. I'M SPEAKING TONIGHT BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY, THERE'S STILL A LOT OF STIGMA ABOUT ADDICTION AT A TIME WHEN SOLUTIONS ARE NEEDED MORE THAN EVER. PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW THAT RECOVERY FROM FROM ADDICTION IS POSSIBLE AND WE DO RECOVER AND THERE'S WORKING MODELS OPERATING SUCCESSFULLY IN OUR BACKYARD. FINALLY, I WANT TO ENCOURAGE EVERYBODY LISTENING TO SUPPORT RECOVERY IN OUR AREA, IN WHATEVER WAY YOU ARE ABLE, IF YOU EVER HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. AND, YEAH. RECOVERY MONTH, WOO! YEAH! THANKS, EVERYBODY. [ APPLAUSE ]
00:20:33.591: >> Mayor Taylor: ALL RIGHT BEING MINDFUL OF TIME, I WOULD LIKE TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ANN ARBOR'S SISTER CITY, HIKONE AND THE 50th ANNIVERSARY OF OUR SISTER CITY RELATIONSHIP. AS FOLKS HERE CERTAINLY KNOW AND MANY FOLKS WATCHING, ANN ARBOR HAS A SISTER CITY RELATIONSHIP WITH HIKONE WHICH HAS ENDURED FOR 50 YEARS. WE HAVE H RESIDENTS COME FROM HIKONE ON A YEARLY AND BIYEARLY BASIS. AND WE ARE -- AND WE HAVE ALSO SENT SELL  DELEGATIONS ON OVER.
00:21:07.358: >> Councilmember Lumm: MR. MAYOR
00:21:12.296: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
00:21:12.797: >> Councilmember Lumm: I WAS HANDED THE GAVEL BECAUSE AN INDIVIDUAL BEHIND YOU IS HOLDING UP A SIGN WHICH OUR RULES DO NOT PERMIT. IN FACT OUR RULES STATE THAT SIGNS SHOULD BE DISPLAYED IN THE BACK ROW OF OUR COUNCIL CHAMBER. AND THIS IS, I WILL SAY FROM THIS VANTAGE POINT A DISTRACTION TO YOUR PRESENTATION AND SO I AM INTERRUPTING. I APOLOGIZE.
00:21:38.122: >> Mayor Taylor: NO WORRIES.
00:21:39.323: >> I WISH YOU WERE THAT ALERT ABOUT THE MASS MURDER OF PALESTINIANS. I WISH YOU WERE.
00:21:45.463: >> Councilmember Lumm: SO MR. MAYOR, THIS IS YOUR MEETING.
00:21:47.465: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SO AS I WAS SAYING, THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER, MAYOR PRO TEM LUMM. THIS IS THE 50th ANNIVERSARY OF THE ANN ARBOR SISTER CITY RELATIONSHIP AND THE SISTER STATE RELATIONSHIP THAT MICHIGAN ENJOYS WITH THE SHIGA. AND EVERY OTHER YEAR, CITIZENS AND RESIDENTS OF SHYINGA. COME TO MICHIGAN AND EVERY OTHER SHEER, MICHIGAN RESIDENTS GO TO SHIGA. AND THIS YEAR, WE HAD MICHIGAN TO SHIGA WHICH COMPRISED OF ABOUT 22, 23 PEOPLE AND A NUMBER OF WHICH WERE GOING -- WERE ANN ARBORRITES GOING TO -- GOING TO HIKONE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE SISTER CITY CELEBRATIONS. WE HAVE, I BELIEVE, THREE MEMBERS OF THE DELEGATION HERE. THEY ARE STANDING BEHIND ME. THERE'S LESLIE, EVA AND DAVID. THEY ALL CAME ALONG, AND IT WAS QUITE AN AFFAIR. ALTHOUGH LITTLE IS MORE TEDIOUS THAN SLIDES OF SOMEONE ELSE'S TRIP, I'M HERE TO SHOW SOME OF THE WHAT WE EXPERIENCED IN SHIGA, IN HIKONE FOR THE PURPOSE OF COMMUNICATING TO FOLKS IN ANN ARBOR AND THE BROADER COMMUNITY THAT -- THAT THEY HAVE FRIENDS OVER IN JAPAN. THAT'S ONE OF THE BEAUTIFUL THINGS ABOUT A SISTER CITY RELATIONSHIP, ABOUT A SISTER STATE RELATIONSHIP. THE WORLD IS A WIDE AND EMPTY PLACE IN MANY RESPECTS BUT THE FOLKS IN SHIGA AND HIKONE, THEY CARE VERY MUCH ABOUT THEIR RELATIONSHIP THAT THEY HAVE WITH MICHIGAN AND ANN ARBOR, AND WE HAVE FRIENDS OVER THERE AND SO IF YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO GO, I WOULD HIGHLY ENCOURAGE IT. SO WANDERING THROUGH THE SLIDES FAIRLY QUICKLY, I WOULD LIKE TO SHOW YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT -- WELL, BACK ONE, THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE ON D.L.-95, ON THE WAY TO -- ON THE WAY TO THAT TO. THERE WAS A WELCOME CEREMONY AT NAGAHAMA. AND THEN WE WENT TO SHIGA. THIS IS A TEMPLE IN OTSU. IT IS A BEAUT, GREEN, SERENE PLACE IN THE MIDDLE OF A CITY OF ABOUT 3 SHUN THOUSAND. THIS IS A PICTURE OF TWO OF YOUR DELEGATES WITH THE MONK -- ONE OF THE MONKS IN RESIDENCE. THERE ARE FEMALE WOMEN MONKS HERE AT THE ISHIYAMA DERA, NOTABLY BECAUSE THIS IS THE LOCATION WHERE A WOMAN WROTE THE TALE OF GENJI. THE TALE OF GENJI IS BELIEVED TO BE THE OLDEST LONG FORM TICKETTIFICTIONWRITTEN BY A WOME 11th CENTURY. AS YOU DRIVE THROUGH SHIGA, THIS IS WHAT YOU SEE. IT IS BEAUTIFUL. IT IS VERDANT AND THERE'S MOUNTAINS AND GREEN FIELDS AS YOU DRIVE FROM CITY TO CITY. IT'S A REMARKABLY BEAUTIFUL PLACE. WE SEE BRIDGES LIKE THAT. WE OFTEN IN MICHIGAN, AND THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES FOCUS ON UTILITY AND UTILITY IS IMPORTANT, BUT MANY STRUCTURES IN JAPAN MANAGE TO MATCH UTILITY WITH A BIT OF DESIGN AND THIS WAS A NOTEWORTHY BRIDGE IN THAT REGARD. WE ALSO WENT TO THE MIHO MUSEUM. IT WAS ART DESIGNED BY IAMPAI. THEN IS ALSO IN THE SHIGA PREFIXTURE. SHIGA IS KNOWN FOR A NUMBER OF CULINARY ITEMS BUT IS KNOWN FOR OMICHA, GREEN TEA. IT IS PERHAPS THOUGHT TO BE THE OLDEST SET OF TEA IN JAPAN. THEY SELL OMICHA FROM THIS FARM AT TEA HOUSE ON 4th AVENUE. SO IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN MIHO, YOU WILL GET TO ENJOY IT AS MUCH AS WE DID. THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE UP CLOSE. THOSE ARE THINGS THAT THE ENTIRE GROUP DID. THEN WE BROKE TO GO TO -- TO HIKONE. THERE WERE A NUMBER OF SISTER CITIES THAT WERE CELEBRATING VARIOUS ANNIVERSARIES AND SO DELEGATES WENT PLACE-TO-PLACE BUT SEVEN OF US WENT TO HIKONE. THERE WAS A LARGE CEREMONY TO CELEBRATE THE 50 50th ANNIVERSARY. AND YOU WILL SEE THE MAYOR THERE. HE WAS A UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN GRADUATE. HE LIVED HERE AND WENT TO SCHOOL IN LANSING COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND THEN WENT HERE TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AND IT TURNED OUT THAT WE REALIZED WE BOTH LIVED IN BATES 1 AT THE EXACT SAME TIME. YES. IRONICALLY I WAS IN EATON HOUSE. LITTLE DID I KNOW THEN. HE DID NOT RECOLLECT THE HOUSING WHICH HE LIVED BUT HE WAS TOO HERE IN 1986, 1987. SO IT WAS A GREAT THING. THERE WE ARE WITH OUR SIGNED DECLARATIONS OF FRIENDSHIP AND SUPPORT AND RENEWAL OF THE 50th E YEAR ANNIVERSARY AND WE ARE STANDING NEXT TO THE MUNICIPAL MASCOT. THIS IS THE MOST POPULAR MUNICIPAL MASCOT WHICH BRINGS IN, AS I GATHER FROM LICENSING DEALS AND THE LIKE ABOUT 300 MILLION YEN EVERY YEAR, WHICH IS -- WHICH DOESN'T HURT ANYBODY. THERE IS A NUMBER OF PEOPLE FROM OUR DELEGATION PICTURED THERE. STANDING NEXT TO ME IS THE CONSUL GENERAL FOR THE AREA AND SHE CAME AND GAVE A SPEECH. AND WE ARE SINGING THEIR HAIL TO THE VICTORS, WHICH IS A LOT MORE BUCOLIC THAN OUR COMMON SONG. HIKONE IS PERHAPS MOST -- IT'S MOST PROMINENT CULTURAL AND GEOGRAPHIC FIGURE IS THE LARGE HILL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CITY, A MOUNTAIN UPON WHICH RESTS A HI HIKONE CASTLE. THIS IS CASTLE ROAD LEADING UP TO THE CASTLE. THIS IS A TYPICAL SIDE STREET. THAT'S WHAT SIDE STREETS LOOK LIKE. THAT'S RIGHT OFF OF CASTLE ROAD. THIS IS THE ENTRANCE WAY TO THE HIKONE CASTLE GROUNDS. HIKONE CASTLE WAS BUILT ABOUT 400,000 YEARS AGO AND ONLY ONE EVER FIVE EX EXTANT CASTLES. MOST OF THOSE HAVE BEEN RECONSTITUTED THIS IS' JAPANESE, FORMERLY DESIGNATED TREASURE AND YOU NECESSARY COULD SITE. AND THIS IS DEFENSIVE, IT'S NOT CEREMONIAL. SO IT IS -- IT IS BUILT FOR THE PURPOSE, ALTHOUGH STILL LOVELY. THIS IS WHAT HIKONE LOOKS LIKE TO THE NORTHEAST. YOU SEE HIKONE MOUNTAINS. AND THIS IS HIKONE TO THE SOUTHWEST, AND THERE ARE THREE MOATS AND HERE IS THE GUEST HOUSE ON THE GARDEN AND THE GROUNDS LOOKING UP TO HIKONE CASTLE, THE CASTLE FOR THE LORD AT THE TIME. THESE GARDENS ARE LOVELY AND BEAUTIFUL. YOU KNOW, WE -- GALLUP PARK IS AWESOME, BUT, YOU KNOW, THIS ONE IS PRETTY GOOD TOO. THE JAPAN CENTER FOR MICHIGAN UNIVERSITIES IS LOCATED IN HIKONE. VARIOUS MICHIGAN UNIVERSITIES OVER THE PAST 30 YEARS HAVE GATHERED TO GO AND FORMED THE JAPAN CENTER FOR MICHIGAN UNIVERSITIES. IT'S ESSENTIALLY AN ORGANIZED STUDY ABROAD FOR PEOPLE INTERESTED IN JAPANESE LANGUAGE AND JAPANESE CULTURE AND IT'S A FASCINATING PLACE. THERE ARE RESIDENTS, PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN LEARNING MORE ABOUT JAPAN AND THE GENTLEMAN. THESE LANGUAGE, THIS IS AN OUTSTANDING -- JAPANESE LANGUAGE, THIS IS AN OUTSTANDING PLACE TO DO IT. THIS IS MYSELF AND EVA, AND THE MAYOR, AND THERE IS VIDEO SOMEWHERE OF ME SINGING "THIS LAND IS YOUR LAND" WITH THE HOUSE BAND. I WILL NOT TROUBLE YOU WITH IT TODAY. IT'S PITCHED FAIRLY LOW. BUT IT EXISTS. NOW, IBUKI IS THE TALLEST MOUNTAIN IN SHIGA AND WE WANDERED OUR WAY UP. WRONG WAY. AND FINALLY TOO, THEY TOOK US TO ISE JINGU, IT'S A BEAUTIFUL SERENE PLACE THAT IS RENEWED EVERY 20 YEARS. THE FORMATIVE SHRINE, THE FOUNDATIONAL SHRINE IS DESTROYED EVERY 20 YEARS AND REBUILT. IT IS DONE SO, SO THAT PEOPLE WILL UNDERSTAND THE CYCLE OF LIFE AND DEATH AND UNDERSTAND AND HAVE RETAINED THE KNOWLEDGE TO REBUILD. THAT'S ME WITH THE MAYOR AS WE ARE ABOUT TO LEAVE. AND THIS IS US -- SOME OF THE ANN ARBOR DELEGATION AT THE MICHIGAN SHIGA GOODWILL FAREWELL PARTY. THERE WILL BE A COUPLE MORE EVENTS THIS WEEK WITH RESPECT TO THE MICHIGAN -- PARDON ME, WITH RESPECT TO THE ANN ARBOR HIKONE 50th ANNIVERSARY OF OUR SISTER CITY RELATIONSHIP. THERE WILL BE, I THINK, MOST FORMALLY, A TREE PLANTING CEREMONY AT COBBLESTONE FARMS ON SATURDAY, THE 21st AT 3:00. YOU WILL SEE -- YOU WILL SEE ME AND SOME MEMBERS OF THE HIKONE COMMUNITY THERE PLANTING A CHERRY TREE. YOU WILL ALSO SEE -- ARE WE ALLOWED TO SAY? YOU WILL ALSO SEE HIKONEIAN THERE. THERE WILL BE REFRESHMENTS OF COURSE. THE SISTER CITY RELATIONSHIP IS AN IMPORTANT ONE. IT BUILDS -- IT BUILDS PERSONAL FRIENDSHIP. IT BUILDS APPRECIATION FOR OTHER CULTURES AND I'M DELIGHTED TO BE ABLE TO TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IT HERE TODAY. SO THANKS VERY MUCH. THANKS, EVERYBODY. [ APPLAUSE ] SATURDAY THE 21st. THESE ARE SOME OF THE OUR DELEGATES AND YET AGAIN, LESLIE, EVA AND DAVID. THANK YOU AGAIN. [ APPLAUSE ] WE NOW COME TO PUBLIC COMMENT RESERVE TIME. PUBLIC COMMENT RESERVE TIME IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO SPEAK TO COUNCIL AND THE COMMUNITY ABOUT MATTERS OF MUNICIPAL INTEREST. TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT RESERVE TIME, ONE NEEDS TO HAVE SIGNED UP IN ADVANCE BY CONTACTING OUR CITY CLERK. SPEAKERS WILL HAVE THREE MINUTES IN WHICH TO SPEAK. SO PLEASE PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE TIME CLOCK. AS A MATTER OF COURT COURTESY, Y ONLY HAVE ONE PERSON SPEAKING AT A TIME. IF YOU REQUIRE ASSISTANCE IN SPEAKING BEFORE COUNCIL, WE WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO PROVIDE IT TO YOU. OUR FIRST SPEAKER IS ALAN JACKSON.
00:33:11.415: >> HELLO, I'M ALAN JACKSON AND I WANT TO THANK COUNCIL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS YOU, AND I DO HAVE TO BE QUICK HERE WITH MY THREE MINUTES. AND SO I WANT TO VOICE STRONG SUPPORT FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL CLEANUP OF LESLIE SCIENCE AND NATURE PARK. JUST TO PROVIDE A BIT OF CONTEXT, I OWNED A HOUSE BY LESLIE SCIENCE AND NATURE CENTER FOR SOME 29 YEARS. I HAVE BEEN A VOLUNTEER FOR LESLIE FOR 25 YEARS AT THIS POINT. AND AT ONE POINT, I WAS THE PACK LIAISON REPRESENT TO THE LESLIE BOARD AT THAT TIME, AND CONTINUE NOW ON THE COMBINED ANN ARBOR HANDS ON MUSEUM AND P.A.C. BOARD. AND I THINK IT'S GREAT THAT THESE TWO LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS HAVE MERGED. NOW, I'M NOT REPRESENTING THE ANN ARBOR HANDS ON MUSEUM OR LESLIE. I'M REPRESENTING MYSELF HERE. BUT I DO WANT TO SAY THAT I DO GREATLY APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT THAT THE CITY HAS PROVIDED TO LESLIE. THE -- THE INABILITY TO USE PARTS OF THE SITE HAVE BEEN A MAJOR PROBLEM FOR LESLIE SCIENCE AND NATURE CENTER OPERATIONS AND THAT'S BEEN GOING ON SINCE JUNE. NOW, PROBABLY ALL OF YOU HAVE NOTICED THAT THERE'S VERY MANY PARKS WITH THE NAME LESLIE IN IT. AND -- AND THAT'S REALLY BECAUSE OF THE GREAT GENEROSITY OF EUGENE AND EMILY LESLIE. THEY DONATED THE LESLIE SCIENCE CENTER LAND AND MUCH MORE TO THE CHILDREN OF ANN ARBOR. AND -- AND PART OF THAT IS I -- THAT WE NEED TO HONOR THAT AGREEMENT AND REALLY, ONE WAY TO HONOR THAT AGREEMENT IS TO DO A FULL CLEANUP OF THE LESLIE SCIENCE AND NATURE CENTER. AND THIS IS NOT BECAUSE OF MY PERSONAL CONCERN ABOUT MY HOUSE BEING NEAR THAT AREA AND THINGS LIKE THAT, AND WHAT THAT'S GOING TO TO TO PROPERTY VALUES WHO -- OR THE EFFECT ON, YOU KNOW, THE BOARD OF HANDS ON MUSEUM, WHICH I'M A VOLUNTEER ON ANYWAY. BUT REALLY, IT'S TO HONOR THAT -- HONOR THAT GIFT, AND THAT REALLY FUNDAMENTALLY THE CITY MADE A -- A -- AN AGREEMENT WITH THE LESLIES TO HAVE THIS AS A PLACE FOR THE CHILDREN OF ANN ARBOR. AND THEREFORE, IT HAS TO BE SAFE FOR THE CHILDREN OF ANN ARBOR. AND SO ANYWAY -- SO, YOU KNOW, THERE'S -- THERE'S SOMETHING YOU ARE GOING TO HOPEFULLY APPROVE TODAY AND I CERTAINLY SUPPORT THAT. I WANT YOU TO ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S PROBABLY CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY ABOUT WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO COMPLETE THAT TASK, AND HOPE THAT YOU SEE THAT THROUGH. I THINK IF ANY OF YOU HAVE CRITICIZED, FOR EXAMPLE, PAUL GELMAN FOR THEIR CLEANUP OPPORTUNITIES. OOPS. I GUESS I'M DONE. SORRY.
00:36:14.364: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
00:36:14.965: >> THANK YOU FOR THE TIME.
00:36:16.633: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS ALAN HABER.
00:36:22.439: >> HELLO, FOLKS. LET'S SEE. I'M HERE TO EXTEND TO YOU ALL THE INVITATION TO THE INTERNATIONAL DAY OF PEACE. I WILL GIVE THIS TO YOU AND YOU GIVE IT TO EVERYONE?
00:36:44.327: >> YEP.
00:36:44.594: >> AND I THINK THERE'S ONE FOR THE CITY ATTORNEY PEOPLE. AND YOU ARE GOING TO DO A LITTLE RESOLUTION. I HOPE YOU ALL ADOPT IT TO RECOGNIZE SEPTEMBER 21-22 AS THE INTERNATIONAL DAYS OF PEACE IN DOWNTOWN ANN ARBOR. AND YOU ARE INVITED. AND, YES, AS YOU KNOW, MR. MAYOR, YOU ARE INVITED TO GIVE A LITTLE TALK, WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND FOR PEACE IN THE WORLD AND LOCALLY AND REALLY ALL OF US IN THIS ENDEAVOR IS TO USE THIS CENTER OF THE CITY PLACE FOR THE NECESSARY CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW DO WE REALLY, YOU KNOW, CONNECT OURSELVES IN TERMS OF A SHIFT FROM A SYSTEM OF WAR AND THE ACCEPTANCE OF DOMINATION AND IMPUNITY AND TOWARD A SYSTEM OF HEALING AND CARING AND SHARING WHICH IS A VISION OF COMMONS AS WELL. THIS RESOLUTION, DC-11 OR SOMETHING, ACTUALLY ON INJURE AGENDA, PLEASE VOTE YES. I SAW ALONG THE WAY, A DC-OF AND IT CAUGHT MY E EYE, BOTSFORD PROPERTY IS UP FOR SALE. THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF PROPERTY THAT MR. BOTSFORD KEPT FOR THE PEOPLE, A TREASURE TO BE THE PEOPLE FOREVER AND NOT TO BE SOLD TO SOMEHOW BE KEPT IN WHATEVER IS THE GREEN WAY AND WHATEVER LIMITATION ON SOMEHOW WHY THAT ISN'T BEING DONE AND IS BEING SOLD, I DON'T KNOW. THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF LAND. YOU KNOW, TOP WHATEVER IS THE POTENTIAL TO SELL IT AND BRING IT INTO SOME WAY TO MAINTAIN IT AND PRESERVE IT BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH BEAUTIFUL ENERGY IN THAT LAND, AND EVEN ALL THE PIECE IN THE WORLD, AND -- PEACE IN THE WORLD, AND WAR IS ON MY MIND, THAT PIECE OF LAND SHOULD BE PRESERVED. TEND TO THAT. DON'T LET IT BE SOLD. FIND OUT HOW TO PUT IT IN THE GREEN BELT AND USE GREEN BELT MONEY OR WHATEVER. SO THAT'S VERY -- THAT JUST CAUGHT MY EYE, EVEN THOUGH I WAS LOOKING FOR THE PEACE DAY. WHEN I SEE THIS IS ALSO CONSTITUTION WEEK, OF COURSE, IT WAS THE CONSTITUTION AND THE RIGHT TO PETITION FOR REDRESS OF GRIEVANCE THAT EVENTUALLY HAS THE CENTER OF CITY BE A PLACE FOR EVERYONE AND NOT A HIGHRISE BECAUSE PEOPLE REALLY WANTED THAT AND W WE'RE GRIEVED THAT TE CITY PROCESS WAS GOING TO JUST MOVE ON TO SELL IT. SO THE CONSTITUTION PROTECTED IT. BUT WE ARE FULL OF CONTRADICTIONS AND I APPRECIATE THAT YOU POINTED OUT THE CONSTITUTION ISN'T ALL THAT WE ASPIRE IT TO BECOME AND THE FOUNDATION OF THE CONSTITUTION, IT WAS SAID THIS CONSTITUTION IS FOR THE PR PRIVATIZATION OF THE COMMONS.
00:39:30.960: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
00:39:31.561: >> AND ATTEND TO THE OTHER TALKS THAT ARE ABOUT PEACE IN THE WORLD. THEY SHOULD BE ON YOUR HEART.
00:39:38.501: >> Mayor Taylor: OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS BLAINE COLEMAN.
00:39:52.716: >> TOMORROW BENNY GANTZ, WHO MIGHT BECOME THE NEXT MINISTER OF APARTHEID ISRAEL, THERE'S GOING TO BE -- THERE'S GOING TO BE THE INITIATION OF WAR CRIMES PROCEEDINGS AGAINST LI HIM IN A DUTCH COURT IN THE HAGUE. SO DON'T THINK THAT ISRAEL'S MASS MURDER OF PALESTINIANS IS A SMALL, OBSCURE ISSUE, FAR, FAR AWAY. THE MAYOR OF ANN ARBOR, YOU LEARNED TONIGHT IS A REALLY INTERNATIONAL GUY. HE SHOWED YOU 29 SLIDES PROVING HE TRAVELED AS A DELEGATE -- A DELEGATE OF ANN ARBOR ALL THE WAY TO HIKONE, JAPAN! AND YET -- AND YET THAT SAME MAYOR TOLD MLIVE A YEAR AGO THAT THE CITY COUNCIL CANNOT DEAL WITH THE MASS MURDER OF PALESTINIANS IN GAZA, BECAUSE THE MAYOR SAID, THE CITY TENDS TO FOCUS ON MATTERS THAT IMPACT MEMBERS OF THE ANN ARBOR COMMUNITY. I HAVE TO SAY IT AGAIN, BECAUSE THE MAYOR DIDN'T HEAR ME THE LAST TWO TIMES I SAID IT. PALESTINIANS ARE MEMBERS OF THE ANN ARBOR COMMUNITY. IN CASE YOU DIDN'T HEAR ME, PALESTINIANS ARE MEMBERS OF THE ANN ARBOR COMMUNITY. WHEN YOU MURDER THEM, IN GAZA, ANN ARBOR PALESTINIANS FEEL IT. IN THEIR HEART. PALESTINIANS ARE MEMBERS THE NOMEMBERS OF THEANN ARBOR COMMUR TAYLOR. I HOPE YOU GOT IT. WE HAVE DEMANDED ACTION AGAINST ISRAEL FOR 17 YEARS IN THIS CITY COUNCIL. THIS COMMUNITY HAS MEMBERS OF THE PALESTINIAN COMMUNITY OF ANN ARBOR AND OTHERS DEMANDING BOYCOTT AGAINST ISRAEL REPEATEDLY IN THE YEAR 2014. AND CHRISTOPHER TAYLOR WAS THE CITY COUNCILMEMBER THEN. HE RAN AWAY INTO THAT WORK ROOM THERE. THE POLICE CAME IN AND CLEARED US OUT. HE VOICED NO PUBLIC CONCERN ABOUT THE MASS MURDER OF PALESTINIANS THEN OR NOW. INSTEAD, HE TOLD MLIVE IN 2014 THAT IF THESE PROTESTS ESCALATE, THE CITY WOULD HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. THAT'S WHAT HE CARES ABOUT. WE DEMAND AN END TO MILITARY AID TO ISRAEL.
00:42:49.425: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS MOZHGAN SAVABIEASFAHANI.
00:42:55.365: >> I HAVE BEEN COMING HERE ALSO FOR 17 YEARS, AND I HAVE SEEN THIS CITY COUNCIL CONTINUOUSLY TURN ITS BLIND EYE TO THE FATE OF MILLIONS OF PALESTINIANS, WHILE SUPPORTING EVERY OUTRAGEOUS AND VIOLENT ACTS OF ISRAEL, LEAVING IT WITHOUT A SINGLE WORD OF PROTEST. SO HOW CAN -- HOW CAN A CITY THAT SO HOLDS PEACE DEAR, NOT EVEN BE ABLE TO SAY WE ARE AGAINST MILITARY AID TO ISRAEL? IT IS BAFFLING FOR ME -- TO ME THAT THIS CITY COUNCIL FOR 17 STRAIGHT YEARS HAS SAID NOTHING ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING TO PALESTINIANS. AT THE SAME TIME, THAT THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN LAVISHING THE RACIST ZIONIST STATE OF ISRAEL WITH BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, PROMISING TO GIVE THEM ANOTHER $38 BILLION PRETTY SOON IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS. IF WE CLAIM TO BE PRO PEACE, WE SHOULD EASILY SAY NO MORE MILITARY AID TO ISRAEL. THEREFORE, I CONCLUDE IT'S FAKE WHEN YOU SAY YOU ARE FOR PEACE, YOU ARE JUST LYING. YOU ARE NOT PRO PEACE BECAUSE YOU DO NOT SPEAK UP AGAINST THE MOST OBVIOUS ATROCITIES COMMITTED BY ISRAEL AGAINST PEOPLE OF PALESTINE. MUST HAVE HEARD MAYOR SAY HIKONE 50 TIMES TONIGHT! I HAVE NEVER HEARD HIM SAY PALESTINE, AVOIDING TO TALK ABOUT PEOPLE OF PAL LOO STIEN, WHOM HE HAS CONDEMNED TO DEATH AND TORTURE BY ISRAEL. HE HAS CONDEMNED THEM BECAUSE FOR ALL OF THESE YEARS, HE HAS SAID NOTHING TO PROTECT THEM WHILE PEOPLE HAVE COME TO THESE CHAMBERS TIME AFTER TIME, DEMANDING SOMETHING BE DONE TO PROTECT PEOPLE OF PALESTINE. WE MUST STOP ARMING ISRAELIS. THEY ARE MURDERING PEOPLE. IT IS THE MOST OBVIOUS ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM. NO AMOUNT OF DROOLING OVER PEACE ARE GOING TO MAKE US PEACEFUL PEOPLE IF WE ARE FUNDING TERRORISTS. IF WE CONTINUE TO HELP SAUDIS AND GIRLI ISRAELIS WE CANNOT CAL OURSELVES PEACE LOVING IF WE WRECK THE HOMES OF PEOPLE ALL OVER THE MIDDLE EAST. CANNOT EXPECT PEOPLE TO BELIEVE US WHEN IN ONE HAND WE ARE GIVING BILLIONS TO ISRAEL AND THEN WE SAY WE ARE PRO PEACE. YOU CAN'T EXPECT THAT. PEOPLE CAN SEE IT. THEY WILL SAY THEY ARE FREAKING LIARS! WE ARE KILLING PALESTINIANS. NO MORE MILITARY AID TO ISRAEL.
00:46:02.418: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
00:46:05.021: >> HIKONE IS GREAT, BUT PALESTINE IS MORE GREAT. I HAVE SEEN IT.
00:46:10.893: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS HENRY HERSKOVITZ.
00:46:25.208: >> GOOD EVENING, TWO ZIONIST SPEAKERS ADDRESSED COUNCIL ON JULY 15 WITH A COMMON AND VERY FALSE THESIS, THAT COUNCIL WOULD BE UNFAIRLY SINGLING OUT ISRAEL WITH A RESOLUTION CALLING FOR AN END TO ITS FOREIGN AID AMOUNTING TO AT LEAST $10 MILLION PER DAY. THE FOLLY OF TRYING TO DIVERT COUNCIL'S ATTENTION TO HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES, IN COUNTRIES LIKE VENEZUELA, CHINA, LIBYA, EGYPT, AND SYRIA, REMINDS ONE OF THE SCENE IN "THE WIZARD OF OZ" WHERE LITTLE TOTO, EXPOSES THE PHONY OZ, WHO CLAIMS, PAY NO ATTENTION TO THE MAN BEHIND THE CURTAIN. COUNCIL BE NOT BE SINGLING OUT ISRAEL WHEN IT PASSES A RESOLUTION ENDING MILITARY AID. THESE TWO PASSIONATE AND DEDICATED PEACE ACTIVISTS ARE NOT SINGLING OUT ISRAEL. ISRAEL IS SINGLING OUT ISRAEL. NONE OF THE COUNTRIES MENTIONED HAVE ATTACKED THE UNITED STATES AS ISRAEL DID IN 1967 IN ITS DEADLY ASSAULT ON THE U.S.S. LIBERTY. NONE OF THE COUNTRIES IS HAVE SPIED UPON THE UNITED STATES THE WAY ISRAEL'S JONATHAN POLLARD DID. NONE OF THE ABOVE COUNTRIES HAVE BULLDOZED TO DEATH AMERICAN PEACE ACTIVISTS LIKE RACHEL CORY IN 2003. ONLY ISRAEL DOES THESE THINGS. NONE OF THE MENTIONED COUNTRIES HAVE A LOBBYIST GROUP EQUAL TO THE AMERICAN-ISRAEL PUBLIC AFFAIRS COMMITTEE, WHO WITH THE ANNUAL INCOME OF $230 MILLION MAKES A MOCKERY OF OUR FOREIGN AID POLICY. NONE OF THESE COUNTRIES HAVE HAD MEMBERS OF OUR CONGRESS EXPELLED BECAUSE THEY STOOD UP FOR THE RIGHTS OF OTHERS. ONLY ISRAEL DOES THESE THINGS. WITNESS THE RECENT ATTACKS ON OMAR OTHERS. DO VENEZUELANS WRITE LAWS LIKE LOBBYISTS? ARE THEY IN VIOLATION OF OVER 70 U.N. RESOLUTION. ARE THEY WAGING A CENTURY-OLD GENOCIDE AGAINST THEIR NEIGHBORS WITH OUR D DOLLARS? ARE THEY USING SNIPERS TO MURDER UNARMED PROTESTORS? ONLY ISRAEL DOES THESE THINGS. SO THE NEXT TIME SOMEONE TRIES TO CONVINCE YOU THAT YOU ARE SINGLING OUT ISRAEL. DON'T PAY ATTENTION TO THE WIZARD OF OZ. PAY ATTENTION TO THE MAN BEHIND THE COMMUNITY.
00:49:17.380: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. ARE THERE COMMUNICATIONS FROM COUNCIL? COUNCILMEMBER SMITH?
00:49:22.618: >> Councilmember Smith: THANK YOU, MAYOR TAYLOR. FOR THE PEOPLE THAT PAID ATTENTION TO WHAT I WAS SAYING WHEN I FIRST RAN FOR COUNCIL IN 2015, WHICH I TOLD PEOPLE THAT I BELIEVED THAT TWO TERMS IS PLENTY FOR ANY INDIVIDUAL ON COUNCIL, I'M JUST GOING TO ANNOUNCE THIS EVENING THAT I'M NOT GOING TO BE RUNNING FOR REELECTION IN 2020. I THINK THAT TO MAKE PROGRESS ON THE ISSUES I'M SO PASSIONATE WITH, TRANSPORTATION, CLIMATE AND HOUSING CHANGE, I THINK WORK CAN BE DONE OUTSIDE OF THE COUNCIL AND THE CITY GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE AND I LOOK FORWARD TO PARTICIPATING IN CITY LIKE THAT WAY. I WANTED TO BE UNAMBIGUOUS ABOUT MY FUTURE PLANS AND I THINK SOME OF THE NEWS REPORTS OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS LED ME TO WANT TO MAKE THIS ANNOUNCEMENT THIS EVENING. SO THANK YOU.
00:50:17.239: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND?
00:50:18.240: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. THE COUNCIL ADMINISTRATIVE -- ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE MET TODAY AND WE DECIDED THAT ON SEPTEMBER 23rd, WE'RE GOING TO OLD A SPECIAL WORK SESSION TO DISCUSS MARIJUANA REGULATIONS. I WANTED TO MAKE THAT ANNOUNCEMENT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, SO THAT MY COLLEAGUES WOULD BE AWARE AND THE COMMUNITY WOULD BE AWARE THAT THAT WILL BE AI TIME TO GAT -- A TIME TO GATHER SOME ADDITIONAL COMMUNITY INPUT, BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THE TIMING IS QUITE TIGHT WITH THIS ISSUE. SO DO MARK YOUR CALENDARS FOR THAT. WE WOULD HAVE GONE A COUPLE OF WEEKS OUT, BUT IT WAS THE RASH ASHANA HOLIDAY ON THE 30th. WE WANTED TO ENSURE THAT WE USED THAT MONDAY THAT WE HAD AVAILABLE. MY APOLOGIES TO MY COLLEAGUES FOR THE SHORT NOTICE. THIS IS A TIGHT TIMELINE WITH THIS ISSUE. IT WILL BE NEXT MONDAY AT 7:00. HERE IN COUNCIL CLAIM BETTERS.
00:51:20.970: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMMS.
00:51:24.039: >> Councilmember Grand: AND I WANTED TO EXTEND APOLOGIES FOR MR. ACKERMAN WHO IS PRESENTED IN SAN FRANCISCO, AND HE SENDS HIS REGRETS. HE LOOKS FORWARD TO JOINING US AT OUR NEXT MEETING.
00:51:40.823: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
00:51:42.258: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU FOR THAT ANNOUNCEMENT. SO OUR ADMIN COMMITTEE MEETING, WE MEET NOT EVERY WEEK BUT WE MET TODAY AT 4:00. AND I DID -- COUNCIL RECEIVED THESE ORDINANCES. COUNCIL, AS WE KNOW RECEIVED THE ORDINANCES VERY LATE ON FRIDAY AND THERE ARE TWO UDC AMENDMENTS FOR MARIJUANA FACILITIES, AND WE RECEIVED THAT INFORMATION -- WE RECEIVED THE ORDINANCES ON LATE FRIDAY, AND THEN WE RECEIVED SOME MEMORANDA OVER THE WEEKEND. ATTORNEY ADVISORY MEMORANDA AND THIS IS A -- THIS IS A HUGE SIGNIFICANT TOPIC AND WE RECEIVED THIS INFORMATION LATE AND WE TALKED ABOUT HAVING A WORK SESSION AND I APPRECIATE THAT MR. LAZARUS, THEN SUBSEQUENT TO OUR ADMIN COMMITTEE MEETING LATE TODAY, YOU SENT OUT AN EMAIL TO ALL OF US THAT YOU WOULD COORDINATE THIS. SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE EVERYONE, IT'S -- WE NEED TO HEAR FROM YOU. AND, AGAIN, THE MEETING WILL BE ON THE 23rd AT 7:00 AND THE INFORMATION WILL BE AVAILABLE ABOUT THE -- IT'S AVAILABLE NOW. THE PROPOSED MOMENT TO THE UDC ON LEG ISTAR. WE NEED TO HEAR FROM YOU BECAUSE THIS WAS PROVED AT THE AUGUST 20ED  20th PLANNING COMMISSION MEETING. I CHECKED OUT. CHECKED OUT THE MINUTES AND THERE WAS VERY LITTLE DISCUSSION AND IT WAS NOT ON FOLKS RADAR. ON THE MORE REASON WHY WE NEED TO HAVE THIS MEETING ON THE 23rd, AND WE NEED TO REALLY HEAR FROM THE PUBLIC AND RECEIVE YOUR FEEDBACK. SO I ENCOURAGE YOU TO JOIN US AT THAT MEETING.
00:53:58.260: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
00:53:59.128: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I WANTED TO THANK EVERYONE WHO CAME OUT AT MY CONSTITUENT HOUR YESTERDAY. THE RAIN HELD OFF AND WE GOT A GOOD DISCUSSION IN AND I APPRECIATE THAT. AND GELMAN UPDATE WAS PART OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS. WE MET LAST THURSDAY, THE INTERVENERS DID AND WE DISCUSSED IT AT LENGTH. WE WILL SPEAK WITH A UNIFIED VOICE, BUT I DO BELIEVE WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS. AND WE HOPE TO RECONVENE IN 90 DAYS WITH SOME MORE CONCRETE MATTERS. AND JUST LIKE TO -- I WOULD TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE, COUNCILMEMBER SMITH FOR HIS COLLEAGUIALITY. I RAN AGAINST HIM IN MY FIRST CAMPAIGN. IT WAS A CAMPAIGN ON ISSUES, AND IT WAS A CLEAN CAMPAIGN. WE RAN AGAIN, AND I SIT NEXT TO HIM HERE AND EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE DIFFERENCES ON ISSUES, IT'S -- YOU KNOW, IT'S NOTHING PERSONAL, AND I -- I REALLY LIKE THAT. HE SITS NEXT TO ME AND REPRESENTS THE SAME WARD AS I DO AND I HOPE WHATEVER COMES NEXT SHOWS THE SAME.
00:55:44.600: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILWOMAN GRISWOLD.
00:55:45.934: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I HAVE THREE ITEMS. OVER 50% OF OUR PEDESTRIAN CRASHES OCCUR IN SEPTEMBER, OF COURSE, NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER. AND THIS YEAR WE ARE EXPERIENCING A HIGHER CRASH RATE THAN THE TEN-YEAR AVERAGE. THERE'S DIFFERENT WAYS YOU CAN LOOK AT DATA BUT THIS WAS THE QUICKEST WAY FOR ME TO LOOK AT IT. PLEASE, WHETHER YOU ARE A DRIVER OR A PEDESTRIAN, BE VERY CAREFUL AND NEVER, AS A PEDESTRIAN STEP OUT IN FRONT OF A MOVING VEHICLE BECAUSE YOU MAY THINK THAT THE DRIVER HAS TIME TO STOP, BUT THE DRIVER MAY NOT SEE YOU, DUE TO LOW LIGHT, DUE TO GLARE, ET CETERA. SO THAT'S MY P.S.A. THE NEXT ITEM IS THAT MOST OF YOU KNOW THAT WE HAVE HAD CLOSED SESSIONS REGARDING THE 1, 4, DIOXANE CLEANUP. I TALKED TO CONGRESSWOMAN DEBBIE DINGLE AND SHE STATED THAT SHE'S GETTING MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE 1, 4, DIOXANE CLEANUP AND SHE'S EXPLORING HAVEY A TOWN HALL MEETING. SHE HAD A TOWN HALL MEETING FOR PFAS THAT WAS VERY WELL ATTENDED A FEW WEEKS AGO. WHILE WE CAN'T TALK ABOUT THE JUDGMENT, WHATEVER IT'S CALLED, COURT JUDGMENT, SETTLEMENT, WE CAN TALK ABOUT AN EPA CLEANUP AND WHAT E.G.L.E. MIGHT DO. AND SO AS I SAID BEFORE, I BELIEVE THAT WE NEED A FULL COURT PRESS AT THIS POINT. WE CANNOT JUST GO DOWN PATH. WE'VE GOT TO KEEP EXPLORING ALL PATHS. AND NUMBER THREE, PLEASE CONTINUE TO USE A2FIXIT FOR STREET LIGHT OUTAGES. WE HAVE MANY STREET LIGHTS OUT ALONG HURON WHICH IS TROUBLING. AND TRASH AND RECYCLING IN BIKE LANES. WHEN THE CARTS ARE THERE. I STOPPED TODAY OUT ON PACKARD AND TOOK API A PICTURE. AND I DECIDED WHY DON'T I JUST MOVE THE TRASH CAN OUT OF THE BIKE LANE. I MOVED TO THE FIRST ONE AND BEFORE I COULD GET TO THE SECOND ONE TWO DOORS DOWN A CITY EMPLOYEE CAME AND PICKED UP THE CART, EMPTIED IT AND THEN PUT IT OUT OF THE BIKE LANE UP ON THE LAWN EXTENSION. SO MY QUESTION FOR THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR, IS THAT A NEW PRACTICE? AND IF NOT, COULD IT BE? SO THAT IF PEOPLE LEAVE THEIR TRASH CANS IN THE BIKE LANE, THEN WHEN THEY PICK THEM UP, THEY COULD JUST PUT THEM ON THE LAWN EXTENSION AND THAT MIGHT REINFORCE THE CONCEPT THAT WE SHOULDN'T HAVE THEM IN THE BIKE LANE.
00:58:37.005: >> City Admin. Lazarus: YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS DRIVING IN THIS MORNING, I NOTICED THAT ONE OF OUR SOLID WASTE TRUCKS, THE OPERATOR GETS OUT TO PICK UP THE TRUCK. I DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S AN UNREASONABLE REQUEST. I WILL TALK TO STAFF ABOUT IT.
00:58:50.853: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
00:58:52.521: >> Councilmember Bannister:  I HAVE FOUR EVENTS TO INVITE EVERYONE TO IN WARD ONE, THIS THURSDAY NIGHT, WE WILL BE DISCUSSING THE BARTON DRIVE SIDEWALK AND RESURFACING PROJECT. THAT'S BARTON DRIVE BETWEEN M14 AND PONTIAC TRAIL AND THE MEETING IS ATAT NORTH SIDE STEAM, AND YOU ARE ALL INVITED. THEN THE CITY WILL BE SPONSORING THREE PUBLIC MEETINGS WITH REGARDS TO AIRBNBs AND SHORT-TERM RENTALS. SO THOSE ARE ON SUNDAY OCTOBER 6th FROM 2 TO 4, JUST BEFORE COUNCIL CAUCUS, FROM 7 TO 9:00. THERE WILL BE ONE ON THURSDAY, OCTOBER 10, FROM 6 TO 8:00 AND ONE ON SATURDAY, OCTOBER 12th, FROM 9:30 TO 11:30. SO YOU ARE WELCOME TO JOIN US. THOSE ARE ALL AT AT THE ANN ARBR DISTRICT LIBRARY RANCHES AROUND TOWN. YOU CAN GET THE EXACT LOCATION AT THE WEBSITE THAT WE HAVE, WHICH IS LEG AIRBNB.COM. SO IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN SHORT-TERM RENTALS AND AIRBNBs AND WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO ABOUT THEM. THOSE MEETINGS ARE COMING UP. WARD ONE, FINDING YOUR POLITICAL VOICE IS HAVING A POLICE CHIEF MICHAEL COX OUT TO JOIN US ON WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 16, AND THEN COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER AND I WILL ALSO BE THERE AND ANSWERING QUESTIONS AND THAT'S AT ARROW WOOD FROM 7 TO 9 ON  OCTOBER 16. AND THEN LASTLY, THE OLD FOURTH WARD IS HAVING A MEETING ON OCTOBER 22nd, WHICH IS A TUESDAY NIGHT AT 6:30 AT ST. ANDREW'S CHURCH. YOU ARE ALL WELCOME TO JOIN US THERE FOR -- TO TALK ABOUT ZONING AND CURRENT EVENTS. AND THEN LASTLY, HOWARD LAZARUS AND I ARE REVISITING SOME OF THE ON-STREET PARKING ISSUES CITY-WIDE, PARTICULARLY AS THEY RELATE TO RESIDENTIAL PARKING PERMITS. WE HAVE BEEN RECEIVING MORE INQUIRIES ABOUT THAT. AND SO WE WILL BE -- I WILL BE LOOKING FOR PROACTIVE PARKING SOLUTIONS RATHER THAN EXEMPTING INDIVIDUAL NEIGHBORS ON A PIECEMEAL BASIS. SO IF YOU HAVE ANY RESIDENTIAL PARKING PERMIT QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS, FEEL FREE TO EMAIL THEM TO ME. THANK YOU.
01:01:24.339: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
01:01:25.607: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WILL BE REAL BRIEF. SO LAST WEEK IT CAME BEFORE COUNCILWOMAN BANISTER AND I THAT THERE WERE SOME FOLKS IN OUR WARD THAT WERE HAVING TROUBLE WITH THEIR TENANCY ON A PLACE THAT'S BEEN CONTINUOUSLY OCCUPIED AND SORT OF AN AD HOC ARTIST LOFT ON 336 SOUTH STATE, SOME OF YOU MAY REMEMBER THE NAME RICHARD AHERN, THE ARCHITECT AND PLANNER WHO LIVED UP THERE, I THINK 58, 60 YEARS IT'S BEEN AN ARTIST COLLECTIVE. AND WE ARE SAD TO FIND OUT THEY MIGHT BE GETTING KICKED TO THE CURB BY THE LANDLORD BECAUSE SOME VARIOUS BUILDING ISSUES AND I THINK FRANKLY -- FRANKLY, I THINK THAT IT WANTS TO BE A -- THEY WANT TO REPURPOSE THE SPACE AND THE SPACE HAS BEEN KNOWN AS ARBOR VITAE FOR MANY, MANY YEARS. AND THERE WERE A GROUP OF FOLKS UP THERE FROM ANN ARBOR AND ALL AROUND THE CITY. STUDENTS AND OTHERS WHO EMBRACED -- WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL THE OLD SPIRIT OF ANN ARBOR AND I WANTED TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT IT AND GIVE THEM A SHOUT AND THANK THEM FOR THE INVITATION AND LET THEM KNOW THAT ANNE AND I ARE DOING WHAT WE CAN DO TO HELP YOU OUT. IT'S DIFFICULT TO GET IN THE WAY OF PRIVATE TENANCY TRANSACTIONS. WE ARE LOOKING INTO THIS FOR YOU AND WE'LL SEE WHAT WE CAN COME UP WITH. AND THE REASON I WANTED TO SAY SOMETHING IS BECAUSE IT'S ONE OF THOSE PLACES. IT'S ONE OF THE HIDDEN PLACES THAT YOU MAY OR MAY NEVER HAVE SEEN HERE IN ANN ARBOR, BUT THEY EXIST AND IN A LOT OF PEOPLE'S MINDS AND MINE INCLUDES, IT REPRESENTS THE SOUL OF THE CITY. AND WHEN YOU SEE 'EM AND UNFORTUNATELY SOMETIMES THEY COME TO YOUR ATTENTION WILE THEY ARE ON THE WAY OUT. AND JUST I ENCOURAGE ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES TO LOOK INSIDE THEMSELVES AND REMEMBER THAT THE -- IT'S -- IT'S GOING TO BE ALL TOO EASY TO WIPE THE SOUL OF ANN ARBOR AWAY. AND SO WE NEED TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO PROTECT THOSE THINGS THAT MAKE THE CITY SPECIAL AND PROVIDE THESE KIND OF ENVIRONMENTS SO PEOPLE GROW OUT OF THESE ENVIRONMENTS AND THEY ARE COMING OF AGE AND COMING THE ARTS AND ALL THE OTHER THINGS THAT COME WITH THESE KIND OF COMMUNAL SPACES. I WAS REALLY ENCOURAGED TO SEE THAT AND I ENCOURAGE THOSE FOLKS OVER AT ARBOR VITAE TO STAY STRONG AND WE'LL SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO HELP YOU.
01:03:44.613: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER COMMUNICATION WITH COUNSEL SIX I WOULD LIKE TO RECOMMEND THE FOLLOWING APPOINTMENTS PRESENTED HE IS SEPTEMBER 3rd, MARY CASEY AND STEPHANIE DOOPER. MAY I HAVE A MOTION, PLEASE? MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER SMITH, AND SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI. DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. WE NOW COME TO THE CONSENT AGENDA. MAY I HAVE A MOTION TO APPROVE THE CONSENT AGENDA. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM. SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRAND. DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
01:04:14.376: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: JUST FOR PROCEDURAL QUESTIONS, I WOULD LIKE TO PULL CA-5 OUT AND CLARIFY SOMETHING ON CA-5.
01:04:21.883: >> Mayor Taylor: CA-5. FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCICOUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD?
01:04:29.791: >> Councilmember Griswold: CA-8, I WOULD LIKE TO PULL.
01:04:33.128: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
01:04:35.497: >> Councilmember Hayner:  NOT TO PULL, BUT TO DISCUSS CA-4. I HAVE JUST WANTED TO POINT OUT IN THE ANSWERS T COUNCIL QUESTIONS, THE VERY INTERESTING TABLE THAT WAS SUPPLIED WITH THAT AND I SIT ON THE BROWNFIELD REVIEW BOARD AND I THINK THIS IS A MUCH NEEDED IMPROVEMENT TO OUR BROWNFIELD POLICY. IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THAT TABLE AND I ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO SO. IT SHOWS THAT WE HAVE HAD SOME -- THE BROWNFIELD IS NOT NECESSARILY USED IN THE WAY THAT MOST PEOPLE OUT THERE IN THE COMMUNITY WOULD THINK OF IT, AS COMPLETELY FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION ABATEMENT AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. IN FACT, THE -- THE AVERAGE WAS 39% OF ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENSES WERE CUT OUT OF THERE, AND THIS IS OVER A HANDFUL OF PROJECTS TO 61% NON-ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENSES WERE COLLECTED AND THAT T.I.F. MONEY WAS SPENT ON NON-ENVIRONMENTAL. AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS PASSING SO THAT IT -- IT PRESCRIBES A BALANCE AT LEAST 50/50, AND HOPEFULLY IT WILL BECOME EVEN MORE FOCUSED ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENSES AND WE CAN SEE THAT THESE COME UP AND WE ARE SURPRISED BY SOME OF THEM, LIKE LESLIE SCIENCE NATURE CENTER, WELL, SOMEWHAT SURPRISED. AND, YOU KNOW, IN SOME CASES, IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THIS TABLE, YOU CAN SEE THAT. I DO HAVE -- AND THIS IS PRIOR TO MY SERVICE ON THIS BOARD, I DO HAVE TO WONDER WHY IT IS A PLACE LIKE 618 SOUTH MAIN, WHICH IS A SPECIAL -- SOLELY COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT, FOR-PROFIT DEVELOPMENT GOT $140,000 ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENSES AND 3 U 3 MILLION IN NON-ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENSES AND SO ON. AND SO I'M HOPING THAT MY COLLEAGUES WILL SUPPORT THESE CHANGES, MUCH NEEDED AND I BELIEVE OVERDUE CHANGES TO OUR POLICIES. THANK YOU.
01:06:33.615: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
01:06:38.753: >> Councilmember Lumm: SO I'M TAKING THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SAY A COUPLE OF THINGS ABOUT CA-4. IT SOUNDS LIKE WE ARE NOT PULLING IT SINCE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IT. I WOULD JUST SAY ABOUT CA-4, THANKS AS WELL FOR THE CHART, AND I THINK THIS IS TIME WELL SPENT BECAUSE IT IS -- IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO HAVE CLEAR PRACTICES AND PRIORITIES IDENTIFIED IN THE POLICY, ESPECIALLY IN TERMS THE NON-ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVITIES AND I THINK THAT THE KEY ASPECTS THE POLICY THAT ARE IDENTIFIED IN THE COVER MEMO ARE REASONABLE AND APPROPRIATE. AND THANK YOU AGAIN FOR PROVIDING THE INFORMATION THAT WAS REQUESTED.
01:07:23.064: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL INIVE IF AOR OF THE CONSENT AGENDA WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CA-5 AND CA-8. ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CA-5 AND CA-8. CA-5. IT IS WITH THE VOTE ON THE CONSENT AGENDA AS A WHOLE IS UNANIMOUS, THUS SATISFYING THE EIGHT VOTE REQUIREMENT WITH RESPECT TO CA-6. AND RESOLUTION TO APPROVE THE AUGUST 22, 2019, RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE BOARD OF INSURANCE ADMINISTRATION. MOVED BY RAMLAWI AND SECONDED BY LUMM.
01:08:12.981: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I HAD A CONSTITUENT COME TO ME. AND I APPRECIATE COUNCILMEMBER LUMM'S HELP IN ANSWERING IT. JUST TO BE CLEAR THAT WE NEED TO APPROVE THE DENIAL BEFORE THE -- BEFORE IT COULD BE APPEALED. JUST MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE NOT THAT'S ALL.
01:08:40.508: >> Mayor Taylor: ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. AND CA-8, RESOLUTION TO APPROVE A PURCHASE ORDER WITH AXON ENTERPRISES INC. FOR THE PURCHASE OF REPLACEMENT BODY WORN CAMERA AND EVIDENCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM UNDER THE NPP GOV COOPERATIVE CONTRACT, VH11629 FOR A TERM OF FIVE YEARS, $372,885.72. MOVED BY LUMM. AND COUNCIL WOMAN GRISWOLD.
01:09:10.438: >> Councilmember Griswold: THERE IS A LESSON TO BE LEARNED AND IT REALLY NEEDS TO BE VOTED ON SEPARATELY. I'M ABSOLUTELY THRILLED THAT WE ARE MOVING FORWARD WITH THIS PURCHASE AND MY ONE QUESTION IS, THIS IS A FIVE-YEAR CONTRACT. WILL THIS BE ENOUGH AND DOES THE CONTRACT STIPULATE THAT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE ACTUALLY FUNCTIONING BODY CAMS FOR THE FULL LENGTH OF THE FIVE YEARS SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE PROBLEM WORK THAT WE FACE RIGHT NOW?
01:09:45.240: >> SO I HAVEN'T READ THE CONTRACT RECENTLY BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT WE HAVE A SERVICE AGREEMENT WITH AXON FOR REPLACEMENT OF ANY DEFECTIVE OR CAMERAS THAT MALFUNCTION THAT ARE DAMAGED. PART OF THE FIVE-YEAR SERVICE PLAN ARE ALL THE CAMERAS AND HARDWARE ASSOCIATED WITH -- WITH THE -- THE ABILITY TO HAVE THOSE CAMERAS.
01:10:11.699: >> Councilmember Griswold: OKAY. IS THERE A WAY THAT WE CAN GET INTO A CYCLE SO WE'RE NOT REPLACING ALL OF OUR BODY CAMERAS AT ONE TIME SO THAT WE ROTATE THROUGH? OR DOES THIS CONTRACT DO THIS?
01:10:24.812: >> YES THIS PROJECT WAS A COLLABORATION BETWEEN FINANCE, I.T., THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AND LEGAL, AND THE IDEA IS THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO CYCLE THROUGH THIS AND HAVE PLANS FOR THE REPLACEMENT OF THE BODY CAMERAS AS IT'S PROPRIETOR. SO THIS IS FOR A FIVE-YEAR AGREEMENT.
01:10:42.797: >> Councilmember Griswold: OH, OKAY. AND COULD YOU ALSO EXPLAIN ONE OF THE FEATURES AND POSSIBLY OTHER FEATURES IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO, BUT WHAT I BELIEVE IS THAT THIS EQUIPMENT, THE CAMERA IS CONNECTED TO THE TASER AND IF THE CAMERA IS OFF, AND THE TASER IS REMOVED, THE CAMERA AUTOMATICALLY GOES ON?
01:11:01.816: >> SURE. ONE THE FEATURES THAT ATTRACTED THE DEPARTMENT TO AXON IS AXON IS THE PARENT COMPANY OF TASER. ONE OF THE NICE THINGS ABOUT AXON AND SOME OTHER COMPANIES THAT MAKE BODY CAMERAS IS THAT THEY HAVE AUTOMATIC TRIGGERS FOR WHAT WOULD INITIATE RECORDING OF THE BODY CAMERAS AND ONE OF THOSE FEATURES THAT AXON HAS THAT OTHER OF THEIR COMPETITORS DO NOT, HAVE IS THAT IT CAN INTERFACE WITH THE TASER.
01:11:30.044: >> Councilmember Griswold: GREAT. THANK YOU.
01:11:32.947: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] ALL OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED WITH 11 COUNCILMEMBERS PRESENT. PARDON ME, IT'S APPROVED WITH 10 COUNCILMEMBERS PRESENT, AND THUS SATISFY THE EIGHT VOTE REQUIREMENT. AND CA-6 IS APPROVED WITH THE BULK OF THE CONSENT AGENDA WITH 10 COUNCILMEMBERS PRESENT. WE NOW COME TO PUBLIC HEARINGS. IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO SPEAK TO THE COUNCIL AND COMMUNITY ABOUT A SPECIFIC ITEM ON THE AGENDA. TO SPEAK AT A PUBLIC HEARING, YOU NEED NOT SIGN UP IN ADVANCE, BUT YOU MUST SPECIFIC TOHE SPECIFIC ITEM ON THE AGENDA. SPEAKERS HAVE THREE MINUTES TO SPEAK. PLEASE PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE TIME CLOCK. AS AWE MATTER OF COURTESY, WE MAY ONLY HAVE ONE PERSON SPEAKING AT A TIME. IF YOU REQUIRE ASSISTANCE IN SPEAKING BEFORE COUNCIL TODAY, WE WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO PROVIDE IT TO YOU. PUBLIC HEARING NUMBER ONE, AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND THE ZONING MAP BEING PART OF SECTION 5:10.2 OF THE CHAPTER 55 OF TITLE V OF THE CODE OF ANN ARBOR, REZONING TO .0.2-ACRE FROM C1B, COMMUNITY CONVENIENCE CENTER DISTRICT TO C1A, CAMPUS BUSINESS DISTRICT WITH CONDITIONS.

01:12:57.665: >> DID I SPEAK TO THIS AT THE FIRST HEARING?
01:13:01.069: >> Mayor Taylor: WE'RE NOT AWARE.
01:13:01.969: >> I WILL SAY THIS AGAIN IF YOU LET ME. I THINK THIS IS A GATE MAN AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO -- A GREAT PLAN AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO MORE QUALITY HOUSING BEING BUILT DOWNTOWN TO CHANNEL PREVIOUS FREQUENT COMMENTER TO COUNCIL, I WISH THERE WAS AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING COMPONENT TO THIS. I BELIEVE THAT THE TRANSIT CONSIDERATIONS FOR THIS ARE EXCELLENT, THAT THERE'S GOOD TRANSIT TO THIS SITE BUT I DO -- I GUESS I DO ALWAYS WISH WHEN ZONING IS CHANGED THAT THERE IS A SPACE IN NEW DEVELOPMENT FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THANK YOU.
01:13:36.838: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
01:13:38.873: >> HELLO. ADAM OXNER. I JUST WANTED TO VOICE MY SUPPORT FOR THIS, BECAUSE THE SAME REASON AS ED HERE, I THINK THAT MORE HOUSING DOWNTOWN WILL BE HELPFUL FOR THE HOUSING -- AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUT MORE ROOMS DOWNTOWN IS GOOD FOR BRINGING THE -- OR HELPING BRING THE PRICES DOWN AND IT'S DOWNTOWN. SO IT'S GOOD FOR TRANSIT AND THE PLANS LOOK GOOD. SO I JUST WANT TO SAY, I LIKE IT.
01:14:06.567: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU S. YOU.IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC HEARING.
01:14:13.307: >> BRAD MOORE, ARCHITECT FOR THE CONTRACT. I THINK YOU HAVE A LETTER IN YOUR PACKET ASKING TO TABLE THIS ONCE AGAIN TO ALLOW MY CLIENTS TO FURTHER PURSUE THE OPTION THAT YOU PRESENTED TO THEM LAST TIME WE WERE BEFORE YOU IN TERMS OF MOVING FORWARD WITH A PUD, INSTEAD OF THE STRAIGHT ZONING. THEY NEED SOME TIME TO CROSS THE Ts AND DOT THE Is AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY DO EVERYTHING RIGHT BEFORE THEY REMOVE THIS PROPOSAL FROM THE TABLE. SO WE'RE ASKING THAT YOU PLEASE TABLE THE PROJECT. THANK YOU.
01:14:47.308: >> Mayor Taylor: ANYONE ELSE LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING? SEEING NO ONE, THIS PUBLIC HEARING IS CLOSED. PUBLIC HEARING NUMBER TWO, RESOLUTION TO APPROVE THE GARNET SITE PLAN AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT, 325 EAST SUMMIT STREET. ANYONE WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING? SEEING NO ONE, THIS PUBLIC HEARING IS CLOSED. I CAN DENY YOU NOTHING. PUBLIC HEARING NUMBER TWO.
01:15:11.933: >> I CAN'T TELL A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ONE AND TWO. WHAT I HAVE HEARD ABOUT THIS AND I DON'T REALLY KNOW, AND I'M FOR MORE HOUSING. I WISH THIS WAS AFFORDABLE HOUSING, BUT I HEARD THAT THIS IS A SHIFT FROM THE REGULAR ZONING THAT'S ON THAT AREA, TO A CAMPUS BUSINESS DISTRICT ZONING, LIKE WAS DONE OVER ACROSS THE RIVER. AND I DON'T GET IT. THIS IS NOT A CAMPUS BUSINESS DISTRICT. THIS IS SOME ACCOMMODATION, FROM WHAT I HEARD TO HAVE DIFFERENT SETBACKS AND TO ALLOW A DIFFERENT KIND OF DEVELOPMENT IN THAT WHOLE AREA, ONCE YOU CHANGE THE ZONING. SO I DON'T REALLY SEE WHY THIS IS BEING DONE, AND JEOPARDIZES, IN A SENSE OF THE QUALITY OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD, FROM WHAT I HEARD. NOW, I HAVEN'T HEARD ANY DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS AMONG YOU. BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM TO STRAIGHTFORWARD JUST TO APPROVE THE THING BECAUSE IT'S MORE HOUSING. AGREE FGOOD FOR MORE HOUSING, IL FOR IT. WHY THIS IS CALLED A CAMPUS BUSINESS DISTRICT? CLEARLY, IT'S NOT A CAMPUS BUSINESS DISTRICT. IT'S CONVENIENT SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE AND IT'S NOT EXACTLY CLEAR WHY AND I WISH THAT WOULD ILLUCIDATED AS WHY THIS CHANGE OF ZONING SHOULD BE DONE BECAUSE IT SEEMS NOT BENEFICIAL IN OTHER ASPECTS, THOUGH IT MAY BE GOOD FOR THIS PARTICULAR COMPANY.
01:16:32.847: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC HEARING NUMBER TWO. SEEING NO ONE, PUBLIC HEARING NUMBER 3, AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND CHAPTER 55, ZONING, REZONING OF .54-ACRE FROM PUD, PLANNED UNIT DISTRICT DISTRICT TO PUD PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT, THE GLEN MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT PUD ZONING AND SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS 201, 213, 215, 217 GLEN AVENUE AND 1025 EAST ANN STREET. IS THERE ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARINGS?
01:17:06.047: >> YES. JUST A LITTLE BIT. I COME TO THE CITY HALL AND THE MAP OF THIS PLAN IS OUT ON THE TABLE THERE. SO I SEE IT ALL THE TIME AND IT'S A BEAUTIFUL BUILDING AND A NICE, FLAT AREA AND IT LOOKS REALLY EASILY ACCESSIBLE AND SO ON. BUT THIS IS NOT A FLAT AREA. IT'S ON A HILL. HOW COME THE DRAWING SHOWS THIS LIKE IT'S FLAT WHEN THE REAL FACT IS THAT IT'S ON A HILL? SO THERE'S SOME KIND OF DESCENSION IN THE WAY IT IS PRESENTED WHICH OFFENDS ME. BUT OTHERWISE, I GUESS IT'S AN OKAY THING.
01:17:37.445: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING?
01:17:50.224: >> I'M STILL ED. REGARDING THE GLEN PARCEL AND OPPORTUNITIES YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU TO ENCOURAGE DEVELOPMENT IN THIS AREA, YOU KNOW, I REMEMBER THAT SITE FROM WHEN IT WAS A GAS STATION, MANY, MANY YEARS AGO AND THEN IT WAS A RUINS, AND THEN IT WAS A FENCED OFF RUINS. SO I THINK IT'S HIGH TIME THAT THE CITY WHILE THE REAL ESTATE MARKET STILL IS WHAT IT IS, ENABLE THIS DEVELOPMENT. HOPEFULLY THE DEVELOPERS WILL BE ABLE TO PUT SOMETHING THERE THAT WILL DO THINGS LIKE ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF VERY DENSE ADJACENT USES LIKE HOSPITAL AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING THIS BILL. THANK YOU.
01:18:36.637: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING? SEEING NO ONE, THIS PUBLIC HEARING IS CLOSED. PUBLIC HEARING NUMBER FOUR, ARE E SOLUTION TO APPROVE THE GLEN MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT MODIFIED PUD SITE PLAN 201, 213, 215, 217 GLEN AVENUE AND 1025 EAST ANN STREET. IS THERE ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING? SEEING NO ONE, THIS PUBLIC HEARING IS CLOSES. WE HAVE BEFORE US THE SPECIAL SESSION MINUTES OF AUGUST 26th R SESSION MEETING MINUTES OF SEPTEMBER 3, 2019. MAY I HAVE A MOTION TO APPROVE THESE MINUTED MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM AND SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRAND. DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] , OPPOSED? THEY ARE APPROVED. B-1 AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND THE ZONING MAP BEING PART OF 5:10.2 OF CHAPTER 55 OF TITLE V OF THE CODE OF ANN ARBOR REZONING .2 ACRES FROM C1B COMMUNITY CONVENIENCE CENTER DISTRICT TO C1A CAMPUS BUSINESS DISTRICT WITH CONDITIONS. THE GARNET REZONING 325 EAST SUMMIT STREET, MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER. DISCUSSION OF B-1? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
01:19:45.906: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I SAW THE -- THE ONE WHERE THE PETITIONER HAS COME UP FOR TABLING THIS AND YOU MAY ALSO NOTICE THAT CONTRARY TO LAST TIME THIS SAT BEFORE US, NOW IT SAYS EIGHT VOTES REQUIRED. AND SO WE HAD A -- WE HAD A SITUATION HERE WHERE THE DEVELOPER ASKED FOR A DELAY BY COUNCIL FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS AND DURING THAT TIME, IMMEDIATELY ADJACENT PROPERTY OWNERS AND NEIGHBORS BECAME AWARE OF THE PROJECT, WHICH THEY PREVIOUSLY WERE NOT FOR WHATEVER REASON, IF IT WAS DUE TO THE NOTIFICATIONS. I KNOW IT'S JUST A LITTLE POSTCARD THAT WE SEND OUT AND MANY OF THESE PROPERTIES AREN'T -- AREN'T NECESSARILY OWNER OCCUPIED. AND SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THEY WENT AROUND AND GOT A PETITION TOGETHER AND SAID WE REALLY DON'T WANT WANT IN THIS M AND IN THIS SPACE. HENCE THE EIGHT VOTE REQUIREMENT. I WON'T MOVE TO TABLE IT. I THINK IT SHOULD BE VOTED UP OR DOWN ON ITS OWN MERITS AND, YOU KNOW, THAT'S JUST -- THAT'S BASICALLY ALL I WANTED TO SAY. SOME OF THE NEIGHBORS REACHED OUT TO ME ABOUT IT AND I APPRECIATE STAFF'S HELP IN PROVIDING THEM WITH THE ORIGINAL CONTACT LIST FROM THE PUBLIC -- PRIOR PUBLIC HEARINGS. SO THANK YOU FOR THAT. I THINK THAT -- I THINK WE ARE DOING THE NEIGHBORS AND THE CITY AND THE PLANNING PROCESSES A SERVICE AND I STILL FEEL LIKE WE SHOULD -- AS A BODY, LOOK AT WAYS TO IMPROVE OUR OUTREACH AND OUR NOTIFICATION FOR THESE TYPES OF PROJECTS. THANK YOU.
01:21:24.071: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:21:25.072: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, MAYOR TAYLOR. I MOVE TO POSTPONE THIS. I THINK THAT THE PETITIONER AND THE DEVELOPER HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THIS BODY AND STAFF AND BY COMING BACK AND ASKING FOR TO COME BACK AS A PUD IS JUST ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THAT. I DON'T BELIEVE -- WELL, I WILL JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT. I JUST DON'T BELIEVE COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER'S ASSEASSERTIONS THAT THIS IS HOTY CONTESTED BY THE NEIGHBORS. WE DID HAVE MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY COME SPEAK TO IT AND SUPPORT IT IN WAYS YOU DON'T HEAR VERY OFTEN. THERE ARE OTHER MEMBERS THAT DON'T SUPPORT IT FOR OTHER REASONS. BUT JUST A LITTLE PUSHBACK ON THAT. YOU ARE ALWAYS GOING TO FIND SOMEBODY WHO OBJECTS TO SOMETHING. THAT WON'T TAKE LONG. SO I JUST MOVE TO HAVE THIS POSTPONED.
01:22:25.399: >> Mayor Taylor: POSTPONED TO?
01:22:34.708: >> SECOND MEETING IN OCTOBER.
01:22:38.912: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THAT SATIS IFSATISFACTORY?
01:22:43.017: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES, IT IS.
01:22:44.818: >> Mayor Taylor: SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER SMITH. CAN I SUGGEST THAT WE MOVE THROUGH THIS ISSUE VERY QUICKLY, COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
01:22:49.456: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES, I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THE DATE. I ACTUALLY SUBMITTED A QUESTION ABOUT THIS. AND MY QUESTION WAS:  KNOWING THAT THEY ARE NOW GOING TO PURSUE A PROCESS -- AND I APPRECIATE THAT THEY ARE DOING THIS, TO SUBMIT AN APPLICATION AS A PUD, AND THE PETITIONER HAS NOT YET INITIATED OR FORWARDED THE RESPONSE TO THIS PROCESS -- I SEE COUNCILMEMBER EATON ALSO ASKED A SIMILAR QUESTION. THE RESPONSE TO THESE QUESTIONS WAS THAT IT IS ESTIMATED THAT IT WOULD RETURN TO CITY COUNCIL IN JANUARY OR FEBRUARY OF 2020 IF THEY DO A NEW REZONING PETITION. SO THAT'S APPARENTLY THE PATH THAT WE ARE GOING DOWN. SO I DON'T THINK OCTOBER IS REALISTIC. ACCORDING TO STAFF. MAYBE MR. LENART COULD STEP FORWARD AND PROVIDE SOME CLARIFICATION. THANK YOU.
01:23:52.920: >> GOOD EVENING, MAYOR AND COUNCIL. THANK YOU FOR REVIEWING MY CAREFULLY CRAFTED RESPONSES TO INYOUR AGENDA QUESTIONS. THAT'S AN ESTIMATE BASED OPEN THE NORMAL REVIEW CYCLES. IT WOULD -- AS I THINK I ALSO INDICATED, I DON'T ANTICIPATE THAT SORT OF THE TECHNICAL SITE PLAN REVIEW IS GOING TO BE THAT BURDENSOME BECAUSE WE HAVE ALREADY BEEN THROUGH MOST OF THOSE ISSUES, WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT UTILITY AND TRAFFIC AND THE LIKE. HOWEVER, CONSIDERING AN APPLICATION UNDER A PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT IS A DIFFERENT PROCESS AND THERE ARE DIFFERENT STANDARDS. SO I WANTED TO ACCOMMODATE SOME SPACE FOR THAT REVIEW AND ANALYSIS TO OCCUR. AND SO IT STILL HAS TO WORK THROUGH THE NORMAL PROCESS OF A PREPETITION MEETING, CITIZEN PARTICIPATION, SUBMISSION, PLANNING COMMISSION AND ON TO CITY COUNCIL AND SO THAT'S MY -- AT THIS POINT, IT'S MY REALISTIC ESTIMATE FOR ALL OF THAT TO OCCUR.
01:24:46.373: >> Councilmember Lumm: AGAIN. I APPRECIATE THAT. I DON'T WANT TO DRAG THIS OUT, BUT GIVEN THAT IT'S -- I DON'T SEE HOW THIS CAN BE TURNED AROUND IN OF COURSE -- BY OCTOBER.
01:25:01.221: >> Mayor Taylor: IF I CAN GET -- DOES ANYONE MIND IF WE HAVE THE PETITIONER HERE FOR THAT CONVERSATION?
01:25:05.993: >> Councilmember Lumm: NO.
01:25:09.563: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. MOORE. ANY --
01:25:10.397: >> SO I WANTED TO CLARIFY, WE BELIEVE THAT BY THAT MEETING IN OCTOBER, WE COULD ALREADY HAVE SUBMITTED THE APPLICATION, GONE THROUGH THE PROCESS AT THE PRE-PETITION MEETING WITH THE PLANNING COMMISSION. WE BELIEVE WE CAN GET ALL OF THAT INITIATION PROCESS IN THE WORKS BY OCTOBER, IN WHICH CASE WE WOULD THEN REMOVE THIS FROM COUNCIL'S AGENDA UNDER THE ORIGINAL C1A REQUEST.
01:25:37.124: >> Mayor Taylor: ESSENTIALLY, YOU WANT IT POSTPONED AND THEN YOU ANTICIPATE PULLING PRIOR TO THE DEFAULT IF THE STARS ALIGN. IF THE STARS DON'T ALIGN, WE WILL GET IT UP IN OCTOBER AND VOTE IT UP OR DOWN AND CALL IT A DAY.
01:25:52.072: >> CORRECT.
01:25:52.506: >> Councilmember Lumm: THAT'S NOT WHAT I HEARD. COULD YOU CLARIFY THIS FURTHER. YOU HAVEN'T YET INITIATED A PROCESS TO SUBMIT AN APPLICATION AS A PUD, CORRECT?
01:26:03.083: >> YES, WE HAVE NOT SUBMITTED AN APPLICATION.
01:26:05.385: >> Councilmember Lumm: AND THAT'S WHAT STAFFING WAS BASING THE TIMELINE ON, KNOWING THAT.
01:26:10.424: >> Mayor Taylor: YOU ARE NOT GOING TO FINISH IT BY THE END OF OCTOBER. BUT YOUR GOAL IS TO GET IT IN AND BE SATISFIED THAT YOU ARE UNDERWAY.
01:26:17.998: >> CORRECT.
01:26:18.599: >> Mayor Taylor: ONCE YOU ARE SATISFIED THAT YOU ARE UNDERWAY, YOU WILL PULL THIS PETITION.
01:26:23.036: >> CORRECT.
01:26:23.470: >> Mayor Taylor: IF YOU ARE NOT SATISFIED THAT YOU ARE UNDERWAY, THIS WILL COME BACK IN OCTOBER, AND COUNCIL WILLING, WE WILL VOTE IT UP OR DOWN.
01:26:32.613: >> CORRECT.
01:26:34.348: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANKS.
01:26:34.982: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER EATON AND I GUESS -- COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
01:26:37.684: >> Councilmember Eaton: THANK YOU. ON THE SUBJECT OF THE POSTPONEMENT, THE CHALLENGES TO THE REZONING ARE GOING TO REQUIRE EIGHT VOTES TO PASS THIS. I DON'T -- I DON'T WANT TO PREDICT HOW OTHERS WILL VOTE, BUT IT -- IT WOULD ASTOUND ME IF IT RECEIVED EIGHT VOTES WHEN IT COMES BACK, IF THEY PURSUED THIS MPARTICULAR ZONING. I THINK WE SHOULD SIMPLY DISPENSE WITH THIS NOW AND ALLOW THEM TO GO THROUGH THE PLANNING PROCESS AND BRING SOMETHING WITH A MORE SUITABLE ZONING CLASSIFICATION BECAUSE BRINGING IT BACK, I DON'T THINK IS GOING TO BE FRUITFUL TO THE DEVELOPER OR TO OUR PROCESS. SO I WILL BE VOTING AGAINST THE POSTPONEMENT.
01:27:27.634: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
01:27:28.735: >> Councilmember Griswold: JUST A TECHNICAL QUESTION. WHAT IS THE BENEFIT OF POSTPONING IT OVER JUST VOTING IT DOWN IF THE PLAN IS TO GO THROUGH THE PUD PROCESS? AND FOR THE RECORD, I SUPPORT THIS BUILDING. I DON'T SUPPORT THE ZONING. SO I'M JUST A LITTLE CONFUSED.
01:27:46.920: >> FROM A CITY PROCESSING PERSPECTIVE, THERE WOULD BE NO DIFFERENT, ONCE THE PUD APPLICATION COMES IN BEING WE WILL START ANEW. AGAIN, A LOT OF THE TECHNICAL ANALYSIS, WE WILL HAVE THE BENEFIT OF HAVING BEEN THROUGH THAT AND I SUSPECT THE SITE PLAN WILL BE NEW. IT WILL BE A NEW ONE IN THE EYES OF CITY. WHETHER IT'S POSTPONED TO AN ITERATIVE DATE DURING A LONGER PUD PROCESS OR IT IS RESOLVED THIS EVENING, WE WOULD BEGIN REVIEW OF THAT AS QUICKLY AND EFFICIENTLY AS WE CAN.
01:28:21.488: >> Mayor Taylor: POSTPONEMENT. I THINK IT'S A ROLL CALL VOTE. THIS IS ON POSTPONEMENT TO THE SECOND MEETING IN OCTOBER.
01:28:27.094: >> Councilmember Hayner:  NO.
01:28:29.930: >> Councilmember Bannister: NO.
01:28:32.466: >> Councilmember Griswold: NO.
01:28:37.404: >> Councilmember Lumm: NO.
01:28:38.639: >> Councilmember Grand: YES. COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN, ABSENT.
01:28:44.611: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
01:28:45.112: >> Councilmember Eaton: NO.
01:28:45.712: >> Councilmember Nelson:  YES.
01:28:47.014: >> Councilmember Smith: YES.
01:28:47.614: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES.
01:28:49.216: >> Clerk Beaudry: THE MOTION FAILS.
01:28:51.018: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN MOTION. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:28:58.725: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I'M KIND OF DISAPPOINTED WITH THAT LAST VOTE. YOU KNOW, I UNDERSTAND COUNCILMEMBER EATON'S REASONING BEHIND HIS NO VOTE, BUT IT'S NO SKIN OFF OUR YOU KNOW WHAT TO GIVE THE DEVELOPER 30 MORE DAYS. WE CAN SIGNAL TO OTHERS THAT THEY HAVE A PARTNER ON THIS TABLE TO WORK THROUGH THINGS. YOU KNOW, WE HAVE, AGAIN -- I WILL GO BACK TO THE MAIN MOTION. I SUPPORTED IT THE FIRST TIME. I WILL SUPPORT IT AGAIN. IT'S OBVIOUS IT DOESN'T HAVE THE VOTES.
01:29:44.071: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM AND THEN HAYNER.
01:29:47.407: >> Councilmember Lumm: I WOULD SUBMIT THAT WE ARE ALL GOING TO END UP IN THE SAME PLACE. YEAH. AS COUNCILMEMBER EATON SAID, YOU CAN'T PREDICT THE VOTES FOR THIS PROJECT, BUT WHAT I HAVE HEARD FROM EVERYONE IS THAT THERE SEEMS TO BE GENERAL SUPPORT FOR THIS PROJECT AND FOR MOST OF US, OBVIOUSLY MYSELF INCLUDED, I THINK THIS C1A IS WHOLLY INAPPROPRIATE ZONING FOR THIS PROJECT AND I AM GLAD THAT THE DEVELOPER INDICATED THAT THEY HEARD US, AND THAT THEY WILL PURSUE REFILING THIS AS A PUD AND I JUST THINK THAT THIS, YOU KNOW, NOW THE PETITIONER IS NOT WASTING THEIR TIME FURTHERING THIS AS -- YOU KNOW, AS INITIALLY PRESENTED AND WILL -- YOU KNOW, I WOULD ENCOURAGE THEM TO SUBMIT THEIR APPLICATION ASAP.
01:30:59.479: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
01:31:01.448: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU. WHEN A REZONING PETITION LIKE THIS, WHEN THE STANDARD CHANGES TO REQUIRE EIGHT VOTES, IT'S NOT BECAUSE PEOPLE FROM HERE AND THERE DIDN'T LIKE THE PROJECT AND THEY CAME OUT. IT'S BECAUSE A PERCENTAGE OF ADJACENT PROPERTY OWNERS FELT THAT THERE WAS SOME CONCERN WITH THE PROJECT. SO IT'S NOT -- IT'S NOT A MATTER OF JUST SOME PEOPLE DON'T LIKE IT. IT'S A MATTER OF THE PROCESSES THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE, TO ALLOW NEIGHBORS OF A PROJECT THAT ARE GOING TO BE AFFECTED BY THE PROJECT, TO SPEAK UP. AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT. THERE'S NO KIND OF A A NEFARIOUS UNDERCURRENTS THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE PROPER NOTICE OF THIS AND THEN WHEN THEY DID INVESTIGATE WHAT IT WAS, THEY DIDN'T LIKE IT. AND SOME OF THEM REACHED OUT TO ME SPECIFICALLY AS THEIR WARD 1 REP AND, YOU KNOW, I ENCOURAGED THEM TO WORK WITH THE PETITIONER IN -- WHEN WE TALK ABOUT PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT AND WE HAVE ADJACENT PROPERTIES HERE THAT THIS MAY BE A MUTUAL BENEFIT BETWEEN ALL OF THEM WORKING TOGETHER FOR A NEW TYPE OF ARE E ZONING AND A NEW TYPE OF SITE PLAN. I HOPE THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO GO ON. NO GUARANTEES BUT THAT WAS MY ENCOURAGE TO THE OTHERS, THE NEIGHBORS WHO WERE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS AND APPARENTLY ENOUGH OF THEM WERE THAT IT RAISED THE EIGHT VOTE THRESHOLD. SO I THINK IT'S WORTH A VOTE TONIGHT AND WE ARE GOING TO VOTE ON IT TONIGHT, AND IF THE PETITIONER IS BRINGING BACK A PUD WHICH IS SOMEWHAT MORE APPROPRIATE FOR THIS SITE, THEN I WILL SUPPORT THAT AND NOT THIS.
01:32:46.119: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
01:32:47.254: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. I THINK IT'S UNFORTUNATE THE WAY I PREDICT THIS VOTE IS GOING TO GO TONIGHT. I THINK THIS IS AN EXCELLENT PROJECT. THE EXISTING ZONING AREN'T RESIDENTIAL. IT'S COMMERCIAL. AND SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND YOU LOOK AT WHAT COULD BE UNDER THE EXISTING ZONING, THEY COULD GET A LIQUOR STORE OR THEY COULD GET 10 CONDOS. I'M GUESSING MOST OF THE NEIGHBORS WOULD PROBABLY RATHER HAVE THE TEN CONDOS, ESPECIALLY ONE THAT IS SUCH AN EXCELLENT PROJECT LIKE THIS. THE ARGUMENT ABOUT THIS IS THE INTERAPPRTHEINAPPROPRIATE ZONINT COULD SET PRECEDENT. I BELIEVE THAT THE WAY THE ZONING WORKS DOESN'T MAKE THAT ARGUMENT A SOLID ONE THAT REALLY THE DEVELOPER DID WORK WITH THE CITY AND LISTENED TO CONCERNS OF THE NEIGHBORS TO COME UP WITH CONDITIONS THAT ARE APPROPRIATE AND REALLY WERE A SOLUTION. SO MY APOLOGIES TO -- TO THE OWNERS OF THIS PROPERTY AND TO THE DEVELOPER. I THINK IT'S UNFORTUNATE TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH A PUD PROCESS WHICH I SEE AS UNWIELDY AND UNNECESSARY, ESPECIALLY FOR A SMALL-SCALE PROJECT SUCH AS THIS. IT WILL CERTAINLY ADD COST AND AS WE TALK ABOUT THE AFFORDABILITY OF HOUSING IN THIS COMMUNITY, WELL THIS IS NOT AN AFFORDABLE PROJECT GOING THROUGH A LONG, DRAWN OUT PROCESS LIKE THIS DOES SET A CERTAIN KIND OF PRECEDENT, I'M AFRAID OF DRIVING UP THE COST OF DEVELOPMENT AND THAT'S NOT GOING TO HELP WITH OUR HOUSING COSTS. I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK NO FURTHER TO SOME OF THE PITFALLS OF P.D. AND OUR FRIENDS FROM THE GLEN AND I'M SURE THERE ARE SOMEWHAT EXPENSIVE ATTORNEYS RAISING THE COST OF THAT DEVELOPMENT IN ORDER TO MAKE A MINOR CHANGE BECAUSE THE REQUIREMENTS OF A PUD. SO, YOU KNOW, I WILL -- I KNOW HOW THIS IS GOING TO GO BUT I WILL STILL BE SUPPORTING THIS CHANGE AND I HOPE THAT WE DON'T LOOK AT INTO THE FUTURE AS THE PUD AS JUST ONE SIZE FITS ALL FOR WHEN WE DON'T LIKE A POSPOTENTIAL ZONING CHANGE.
01:34:59.185: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER SMITH?
01:35:00.887: >> Councilmember Smith: MR. LYNN ART, CAN YOU CONFIRM THAT THIS PROTEST PETITION WAS SIGNED BY ONE ADJACENT PROPERTY OWNER?
01:35:08.428: >> YES.
01:35:08.695: >> Councilmember Smith: BECAUSE OF THE UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ONE PROPERTY REPRESENTED 23% OF THE SURROUNDING AREA?
01:35:13.700: >> YES, THE PETITION THRESHOLD IS A PERCENTAGE OF LAND REPRESENTED BY OWNERS AND IN THIS CASE, THE THRESHOD WAS MET BY ONE PROPERTY OWNER.
01:35:23.510: >> Councilmember Smith: THANK YOU. I WANTED TO BE CLEAR ABOUT THAT. ONE PROTEST. THANK YOU.
01:35:27.514: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? FOR MY PART, I THINK THE FAILURE TO POSTPONE THIS WAS A DISCOURTESY THAT WE -- WELL, IT WAS A DISCOURTESY AND WE -- AND WE OUGHT TO -- WE OUGHT TO HAVE EXTENDED THAT REQUEST. SECOND, I'M NOT AT ALL CONCERNED BY REZONING THIS TO, YOU KNOW, REZONING THIS AS PROPOSED. IT IS PRESENTLY -- IT'S COMMERCIAL. IT IS A COMMUNITY CONVENIENCE CENTER DISTRICT. THIS IS -- MOVING IT TO C1A IS NOT A CRIME AGAINST NATURE. IT'S AN ADVANCE AND A BENEFIT TO THE COMMUNITY. IT'S HOUSING WHERE HOUSING IS FEISNEEDED AND I REGRET HOW I SE THIS WILL GO. FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
01:36:13.793: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WILL JUST SAY TWO THINGS. I -- YOU KNOW, ANYONE HERE AT THIS TABLE CAN CHANGE THOSE RULES FOR NATION AND FOR PROTEST. THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT GOES. IT'S ON A CORNER. WELL, THEN WHAT'S THE COMPLAINT THAT IT WAS ONLY ONE PERSON WHO WILL LIVE IN THE SHADOW OF THIS FOREVER? I MEAN, THAT'S THEIR RIGHT TO COMPLAIN AND THEY MET THE RULES. THEY MET THE STANDARD. SO IT'S EIGHT VOTES. IF IT'S SUCH A GREAT PROJECT, IT WILL GET EIGHT VOTES, BUT TO SPEAK TO THE FACT THAT IT'S COMMERCIAL AND THEREFORE MAKING IT COMMERCIAL AGAIN IS NOT A PROBLEM, THE ONLY PROBLEM I THINK THAT SOME PEOPLE HAVE WITH THAT IS THERE'S NOT AN OUNCE OF COMMERCIAL TO BE HAD IN THIS PROJECT! AND SO THIS IS REALLY A WORK AROUND TO GET A LARGER SQUARE FOOTAGE AND REMOVE THE SETBACKS TO CREATE A TYPE OF PROJECT THAT IS MORE PROFITABLE FOR THE DEVELOPERS AND THAT IS FINE. THAT'S CAPITALISM. BUT DON'T PRETEND THAT THAT IT'S PROPER TO ASK FOR COMMERCIAL TO BE REZONED TO A DIFFERENT TYPE OF COMMERCIAL AND THEREFORE, TO ALLOW A BUNCH OF CONDOS TO GO IN THERE AND NOT AN ANSWER OF AN OF COMMERCIAL. IT'S THE SAME THING THAT HAPPENED AT LOWER TOWN. THAT'S A MISUSE OF OUR ZONING AUTHORITY HERE.
01:37:33.973: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
01:37:34.974: >> Councilmember Lumm: AND I WOULD ALSO JUST NOTE THAT -- AND I PASS THIS ALONG AS A HEADS UP TO THE STAFF, THAT WITH A PUD, YOU KNOW -- I DON'T KNOW IF THIS WILL BE REQUESTED OR NOT, BUT THAT PROVIDES AN AVENUE FOR -- FOR REQUESTING SOME AFFORDABILITY, WHICH YOU CAN'T GET WITH C1A. SO THAT IS ANOTHER BENEFIT AND, AGAIN, I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WOULD BE PURSUED OR NOT, BUT IT IS ONE AVENUE THAT COULD BE PURSUED AND I APPRECIATE WHAT COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER JUST NOTED THAT YES. SO WE ARE REINSTITUTING. WE ARE JUST SLIGHTLY CHANGING THE ZONING TO C1A. THERE'S NO COMMERCIAL ASPECT TO THIS PROJECT, AND I -- AS I SAID PREVIOUSLY, I REALLY THINK THAT MAKES A FARCE OF OUR ZONING CODE. SO WE'LL JUST LOAD IT UP WITH CONDITIONS TO FORCE FIT IT. THAT'S NOT OKAY IN MY VIEW.
01:38:48.214: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:38:55.922: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU FOR THE SECOND TIME ON THE MAIN MOTION. JUST SITTING BACK AND LISTENING TO THINGS AND LISTENING TO MY CONSTITUENTS AND ISSUES AND THE ARGUMENTS WE HAVE LISTENED TO FOR AN HOUR OR A YEAR NOW ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING, PROVIDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WITH WE ARE ELECTED OFFICIALS. I DON'T KNOW IF ANYONE IS HERE AS A DEVELOPER, SOMEONE WHO BUILDS AND CONSTRUCTS BUILDINGS AND KNOWS THE ACTUAL COSTS THESE DAYS TO BUILD. IT'S NOT CHEAP. WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF GREAT LAND TO CHOOSE FROM. IT'S EXPENSIVE TO BUILD. I JUST THINK WE ARE GIVING THAT REALLY CRAZY BOX TO WORK IT FOR PEOPLE TO DELIVER AFFORDABLE HOUSING, WORKFORCE HOUSING, AND I WILL RESPECT THE VOTES OF MY COLLEAGUES BUT I REALLY WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE REALISTIC GOALS, MORE REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS AND THAT'S -- I WILL LEAVE IT AT THAT.
01:40:13.533: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. ROLL CALL VOTE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
01:40:19.305: >> Councilmember Hayner:  NO.
01:40:21.441: >> Councilmember Bannister: NO.
01:40:24.177: >> Councilmember Griswold: NO.
01:40:28.681: >> Councilmember Lumm: NO.
01:40:30.550: >> Councilmember Grand: YES COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN ABSENT.
01:40:36.789: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
01:40:37.290: >> Councilmember Nelson:  YES.
01:40:39.525: >> Councilmember Smith: YES,.
01:40:40.159: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES.
01:40:41.728: >> Clerk Beaudry: THE MOTION FAILS.
01:40:44.764: >> Mayor Taylor: AB LIVE 2, AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND CHAPTER 55, ZONING, ARE E ZONING, OF .54-ACRE FROM PUD PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER SMITH, AND SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRAND. DISCUSSION, PLEASE OF B-2. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
01:41:07.787: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU. HERE'S A SITUATION WHERE PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT ALLOWED THEM TO DO SOME THINGS THAT -- AND PROVIDE SOME COMMUNITY BENEFITS THAT THE ZONING WOULD NOT HAVE ON THAT SITE. AND SO THERE IS NOT A BIG AFFORDABLE COMPONENT BUT THERE WAS SOME ENVIRONMENTAL CLEANUP AND SOME OTHER THINGS. AND SO I -- IT'S -- I THINK THIS IS PERFECTLY APPROPRIATE USE OF PUD AND I'M HAPPY TO SEE THIS MOVE FORWARD.
01:41:35.748: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. C-1. [ OFF MICROPHONE COMMENTS ]
01:41:55.301: >> Councilmember Eaton: COULD WE INVITE THE PETITIONER TO THE PODIUM?
01:41:59.639: >> GOOD EVENING. I PROVIDED YOU ADMITTEDLY QUITE LATE THIS EVENING WITH SOME PROPOSED MINOR MODIFICATIONS TO THIS AGENDA ITEM.
01:42:08.815: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES, IT'S AMENDED.
01:42:09.816: >> SO I WOULD ASK THE COUNCIL'S CONSIDERATION OF THOSE. THEY ARE QUITE MINOR MODIFICATIONS. ONE WOULD CHANGE THE F.A.R. BY ABOUT A LITTLE OVER 2,000 SQUARE FEET, AND THE OTHER ONE WOULD STRIKE A REFERENCE TO A PENTHOUSE WHICH IS NO LONGER BEING PROPOSED FOR THE SITE. HOWEVER MINOR THEY ARE, I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT IF THE COUNCIL WISHED TO CONSIDER THEM AND THEY ARE REQUESTED BY THE PETITIONER THAT YOU WOULD CONVERT THIS TO A FIRST READING AND THEN RESCHEDULE SECOND HEARINGS SO THAT WE MAY MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE NOTICED WITH THOSE SPECIFIC REFERENCE POINTS.
01:42:45.251: >> Mayor Taylor: PROCEDURALLY, THIS CONFUSES ME. I'M WILLING TO JUST UNROLL THIS.
01:42:55.928: >> Councilmember Lumm: MOVE TO --
01:42:56.729: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WILL MOVE TO RECONSIDER.
01:42:58.731: >> Mayor Taylor: SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM. ALL IN FAVOR. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED?
01:43:06.038: >> Mayor Taylor: IT'S MOVED FOR RECONSIDERATION.
01:43:07.807: >> SO I HAVE PROVIDED VIA EMAIL A REVISED SET OF SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS THAT SHOW THOSE TWO MINOR MODIFICATIONS.
01:43:14.647: >> Mayor Taylor: SO THOSE ARE IN THE PACKET AND READY TO BE MOVED RIGHT NOW?
01:43:18.217: >> THEY ARE VIA EMAIL.
01:43:19.852: >> Mayor Taylor: SORRY, THEY ARE IN EMAIL AND READY TO BE MOVED.
01:43:22.822: >> THEY WOULD CERTAINLY BE ADDED TO THE RECORD. THIS WOULD BE SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS. AGAIN, BECAUSE OF THE CHANGE IN THE NUMBERS, I WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU THEN CONVERT THIS TO A FIRST READING AND HOLD ANOTHER SECOND READING JUST SO THAT THE NOTICE GOES OUT WITH THE SPECIFIC LANGUAGE.
01:43:37.737: >> Mayor Taylor: SO WE NEED TO HAVE THESE AMENDMENTS MOVED AND PASSED TONIGHT.
01:43:42.842: >> YES.
01:43:43.142: >> Councilmember Eaton: I WOULD MOVE THE AMENDMENTS.
01:43:46.312: >> Mayor Taylor: MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER EATON AND SECONDED BY GRISWOLD.
01:43:53.619: >> Councilmember Eaton: I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK. I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE MINOR AMENDMENTS WOULD MEAN THIS IS A FIRST READING. THEY ARE LESS DEMANDING OF THE SITE. THEY ARE CUTTING BACK THE F.A.R. --
01:44:07.500: >> Councilmember Lumm: NO, THEY ARE ADDING.
01:44:09.936: >> Councilmember Eaton: THEY ARE ADDING 2,000 FEET. I'M SORRY. I MISUNDERSTOOD THAT.
01:44:13.339: >> TO BE CLEAR, THEY ARE MOVING F.A.R. FROM WHAT WAS PREVIOUSLY APPROVED FROM THE STANDING APPROVAL FROM THE PUD, BUT THEY HAVE BEEN NOTICED WITH A SLIGHTLY LOWER F.A.R. THAN IS PROPOSING NOW. THAT'S THE APPROXIMATELY 2,000 SQUARE FEET DIFFERENCE.
01:44:29.589: >> Councilmember Eaton: NEVER MIND. I TAKE BACK THAT COMMENT. I'M WILLING TO VOTE ON THIS AS A FIRST READING.
01:44:35.728: >> Mayor Taylor: I THINK THIS IS READY TO BE ACCEPTED AS A FRIENDLY BASIS. DOES THE PETITIONER NEED TO SPEAK?
01:44:41.601: >> Councilmember Lumm: I THINK THAT WOULD BE NICE.
01:44:45.237: >> Mayor Taylor: ANY OBJECTION?
01:44:46.339: >> Councilmember Lumm: NO.
01:44:46.906: >> Mayor Taylor: IF YOU WISH, IF NOT, NO WORRIES.
01:44:49.141: >> Councilmember Lumm: YEAH.
01:44:50.576: >> Mayor Taylor: MY OLOGIES. APOLOGIES. [ OFF MICROPHONE COMMENT ]
01:44:56.816: >> Mayor Taylor: NO WORRIES.
01:44:59.452: >> THANK YOU. YOU KNOW, THIS HAS BEEN A LONG -- LONG SAGA. I'M GETTING OLDER AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT GET DONE. I THINK IT WILL BE GREAT FOR THE COMMUNITY. WE WERE READY TO GO AND THEN IN CONSULTATION WITH OUR ARCHITECTS, NOTICED A TECHNICAL -- WHEN THEY DID THE CONSTRUCTION DRAWINGS THERE WAS, YOU KNOW, A FINER CALCULATION SAID, YOU KNOW, WE MIGHT BE OVER AND THE ONLY THING WE NEVER WANTED TO DO WAS GO BACK TO THE STARTING LINE AND START AGAIN. SO CONTACTED MR. LENART. I COMPLIMENTED HIM ON HIS RESPONSIVENESS AND I APPRECIATE IT. YOU KNOW, IF I WERE KING, THIS REALLY DOESN'T CHANGE THE PROJECT. I WOULD LIKE IT TO BE DONE TONIGHT. BUT IF THE RIGHT THING TO DO IS TO MAKE IT A FIRST READING, ALL WE WOULD ASK IS TO GET US BACK FOR THE SECOND READING AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
01:46:03.816: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. IS THAT A QUESTION?
01:46:05.951: >> Councilmember Grand: I HAVE A QUESTION FOR MR. LENART. I KNOW THAT THE LANGUAGE READS INCREASING THE MAXIMUM F.A.R. BY 10%. BUT IT'S ACTUALLY GOING FROM 568% 578%. SO BY MY MATH, THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY INCREASING THE F.A.R. BY 10% --
01:46:33.179: >> IT'S AN INCREASE OF 10% OF THE F.A.R., THAT'S CORRECT. IT'S 2,000 SQUARE FEET.
01:46:38.718: >> Councilmember Grand: IT'S NOT RIGHT. BUT MY POINT IS IT'S NOT ADDING THAT MUCH F.A.R. SO 10% SOUNDED LIKE MORE TO MY EAR. SO I DON'T KNOW IF THAT ACTUALLY MAKES IT SUBSTANTIVE ENOUGH.
01:46:53.532: >> Mayor Taylor: LET'S DO THIS. ARE THE AMENDMENTS FRIENDLY? THE AMENDMENTS ARE FRIENDLY, YES? OKAY. I'M COUNTING THE AMENDMENTS AS FRIENDLY AND WE ARE NOW DELIBERATING THE AMENDED -- THE AMENDED RESOLUTION. DETERMINING, I GUESS -- LET ME PAUSE ON THIS. DO I HEAR FROM ATTORNEYS THAT AND STAFF THAT FOR OUR PURPOSES WITHIN OUR -- WITHIN WHAT WE DO THIS IS IMPROPER TO PASS TONIGHT? , THAT WE DO, IN FACT, NEED TO GO BACK TO FIRST READING?
01:47:22.795: >> City Atty. Postema: THAT IS CORRECT. THAT'S MOST CONSERVATIVE APPROACH, YES.
01:47:26.232: >> Mayor Taylor: ALL RIGHT. THAT'S JUST WHAT WE ARE GETTING -- THAT'S THE ADVICE WE ARE GETTING FROM STAFF. WITH MY APOLOGIES.
01:47:37.943: >> YOU KNOW, CONSTITUTIONALLY, IF I WERE KING -- [ LAUGHTER ] -- I DON'T NECESSARILY AGREE, BUT, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE ENJOYED WORKING WITH THE CITY. THIS DOESN'T -- I JUST WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR, THAT THIS IS A ZERO LOT LINE BUILDING. WE HAVE AGREED ON THE TIGHT. HEIGHT. WE HAVE AGREED ON THE ELEVATIONS THIS IS THE INTERIOR CALCULATIONS OF WHAT HAPPENS WITH ELEVATOR SHAFTS AND SO ON AND SO FORTH. IT'S DE MINIMIS AND MEANINGLESS, BUT WE DEFER WITH YOU.
01:48:09.942: >> Councilmember Eaton: IF I MAY? I HAVE A QUESTION.
01:48:14.046: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
01:48:14.980: >> Councilmember Eaton: THIS IS FOR THE CITY ATTORNEY. WHO WOULD CHALLENGE THIS ON THE BASIS OF US APPROVING THIS TINY CHANGE AND NOT BRINGING IT BACK FOR ANOTHER READING?
01:48:29.195: >> City Atty. Postema: WELL, I WILL JUST SAY I'M NOT SURE THIS IS THE APPROPRIATE FORUM FOR ME TO SORT OF ANSWER THAT QUESTION. I THINK WHAT YOU -- WHAT YOU SEE KIND OF HAPPENING OR AT LEAST MAYBE I WILL ANSWER IT THIS WAY, THIS CHANGE, I BELIEVE, CAME IN TODAY, A AM I CORRECT? IT CAME IN OVER THE WEEKEND. IT IS A -- THIS IS A -- IT'S A PUD ZONING. IT HAS SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS FOR THIS PARTICULAR SITE. ONE OF THEM AS YOU KNOW THAT IS OFTEN TALKED ABOUT WITHIN THE -- AT THIS BODY IS FLOOR AREA RATIO. THEY ARE EXPANDING THE FLOOR AREA RATIO. THERE ARE NEIGHBORING BUILDINGS ALTHOUGH IT MAY BE DE MINIMIS IN A CERTAIN EXTENT. I THINK INSTEAD OF MAKING A JUDGMENT IN TERMS OF IT BEING DE MINIMIS OR NOT, THERE'S NEIGHBORING PROPERTIES THAT MAY OTHERWISE BE AFFECTED BY THIS. WE CERTAINLY DID NOT -- I WILL JUST SAY THIS, THE SIZE OF THE BUILDING, THAT'S HOW WE CONTROL THE SIZE OF OUR BUILDINGS BY FLOOR AREA RATIO, AND SO THAT WAS ONE OF THE ISSUES TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT WHEN MR. LENART BROUGHT THIS TO OUR ATTENTION. THE MOST CONSERVATIVE APPROACH IS TO MOVE FORWARD IN THIS MANNER.
01:49:53.646: >> Mayor Taylor: CAN WE VOTE ON THIS ON THAT BASIS. I GUESS COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER WAS RAISING HIS HAND AND THEN COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:50:02.588: >> Councilmember Hayner: MR. LENART COULD EDUCATE US. WHAT IS THE THRESHOLD FOR A SUBSTANTIVE CHANGE? ANY CHANGE? I MEAN, DOES -- OBVIOUSLY WE FEEL THAT THIS -- OR LEGAL FEELS THAT THIS MEETS THAT BUT IT SEEMS SO SMALL.
01:50:18.871: >> SO FROM MY LENS, I THINK THIS IS A VERY SMALL CHANGE, ALONG WITH COUNCILMEMBER EATON'S INDICATION THAT IF THE [ NO AUDIO ] WHAT WAS PUBLISHED AND NOTICED THROUGH THIS PROCESS, I THINK THAT THAT -- I WOULD BE MORE COMFORTABLE IN MAKING THAT CHANGE. IN THIS CIRCUMSTANCE, ALTHOUGH IT IS QUITE SLIGHT IN THE CONTEXT. PROJECT, I THINK THAT TO -- TO RECOMMEND TO YOU THE MOST DEFENSIBLE POSITION IS -- POSITION ON YOUR DECISION IS TO SAY THAT THIS IS A RELATIVELY MINOR DELAY WITH ALL APOLOGIES TO THE PETITIONER. IT GIVES -- IT AFFORDS US THE ABILITY TO ALLOW TYPICAL FIRST READING. YES, WE ARE COMFORTABLE WITH THIS LANGUAGE. RENOTICE IT FOR SECOND READING. IN THE VERY UNLIKELY EVENT THAT SOMEBODY SAW THAT NOTICE PREVIOUSLY AND SAID, OH, AT 568 IT WAS GREAT BUT AT 578, I DRAW THE LINE. THEY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME OUT AND EXPRESS THEIR COMMENT. THAT WAS MY RATIONALE.
01:51:26.438: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I APPRECIATE THAT. TAME COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:51:30.476: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I WOULD LIKE TO ASK THE PETITIONER, WOULD THIS CAUSE ANY HARDSHIP, DELAY IN THE PROJECT IF WE NEED TO HAVE THIS GO BACK TO FIRST READING?
01:51:40.252: >> YEAH, IT WILL DELAY US BY THE AMOUNT OF TIME BETWEEN TONIGHT AND THE NEXT READING. WE ARE ACTIVELY MOVING ON THE PROJECT. WE ARE EAGER TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN, AS I THINK SOMEONE ELSE IN THE PUB W PUBLIC SAID. SO WE ARE READY TO GO. YOU KNOW, FRANKLY, I -- I WAS NOT HAPPY WHEN I RECOGNIZED THAT THIS WAS A POTENTIAL ISSUE AND THAT'S WHY WE BROUGHT IT TO LENART'S COMMISSION. WE CALLED IN THE AIRSTRIKE ON OURSELVES, SO TO SPEAK. I WOULD HAVE, AS THEY SAY, IF I WERE SITTING IN McDONALD'S OR MRSTEMA'S SEAT, I MIGHT HAVE COME TO A DIFFERENT CONCLUSION BUT THAT'S NOT MY JOB.
01:52:28.300: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I WOULD JUST -- YOU EXPLAINED YOURSELF WELL. WE HAVE BEEN ANTICIPATING THIS PROJECT FOR QUITE A WHILE. YOU HAVE A LOT OF MONEY IN THERE. IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A VERY BIG OF A CHANGE. IT SEEMS LIKE A MINUTE CHANGE. IN MY OPINION, BUT I'M NOT A LEGAL EXPERT. IT DOESN'T CAUSE CONCERN TO KICK IT DOWN TO FIRST READING, BUT THAT'S JUST ONE COUNCILMEMBER'S OPINION. LIKE COUNCILMEMBER GRAND HAS QUICKLY DONE THE MATH, THIS IS JUST A 2% INCREASE OF THE FLOOR AREA. AGAIN THIS ILLUSTRATES THE DIFFICULTIES OF PUDs FOR MY COLLEAGUES AND MYSELF, AS WE LEARN. EVEN THE SMALLEST CHANGE HAS A RIPPLE EFFECT. SO, YOU KNOW, I WOULD JUST TRY TO PUSH BACK AND GET THIS APPROVED. I THINK THESE -- THIS COMMUNITY HAS BEEN WAITING TOO LONG AND IT'S TOO MUCH MONEY AND IT'S NOT A SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE.
01:53:37.302: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND -- LUMM.
01:53:41.206: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANKS. THANK YOU, MAYOR. YOU DID CALL AN AIRSTRIKE ON YOURSELF. YOU HAVE BEEN SUPREMELY STRAIGHTFORWARD AND HELPFUL THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS, AND I REGRET THAT THIS WOULD CAUSE FURTHER DELAY. NO QUESTION. IT'S A PI MINOR CHANGE, BUT IT'S REALLY MORE PRINCIPLE THAN ANYTHING, AND, YOU KNOW, THINK -- I THINK, YOU KNOW, CRACKING OPEN A DOOR EVER SO SLIGHTLY, BUT YOU ARE. COUNCIL, BECAUSE ANOTHER PROJECT COULD COME ALONG AND AT THE 11th HOUR SAY, HEY, YOU KNOW, WE MADE A -- THERE'S A LIGHT ADJUSTMENT TO F.A.R. IT'S ONLY 5% OR 3%, BUT WHERE DO YOU DRAW THE LINE? IT'S PRINCIPLE. A CHANGE WAS MADE AND IT'S APPROPRIATE TO GO BACK TO FIRST READING. WE ARE JUST FOLLOWING THE RULES, WHETHER YOU LIKE THEM OR NOT, RULES ARE THE RULES AND I THINK WE NEED TO LIVE AND FOLLOW THOSE RULES AND I DO SINCERELY APOLOGIZE. I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS WILL GO, BUT FOR THE DELAY CAUSED YOU AND -- BUT I THINK IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND I APPRECIATE IF YOU WERE ON COUNCIL, YOU WOULD PROBABLY BE ADVISING US, THE WAY OUR COUNSEL IS ADVISING US.
01:54:55.647: >> I APPRECIATE THE CITY COUNCIL.
01:54:58.150: >> Councilmember Lumm: YOU HAVE BEEN VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD AND WONDERFUL TO WORK WITH AND MY APOLOGY.
01:55:01.453: >> I HAD A WHOLE LIST OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS WE WERE GOING TO TALK ABOUT TO REMIND EVERYBODY WHAT WE HOPED TO BRING TO THE CITY. YOU KNOW, THERE'S A LOT OF TALK ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO HALF MILLION DOLLARS FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTION TO THAT. ALL OF THAT IS IN ADDITION TO WHAT WE HOPE WILL BE A LANDMARK ADDITION TO THE CITY THAT WILL THROUGH ITS FUNCTION, SPACE, AND SO FORTH ENRICH THE LIFE OF THE CITY. SO, YOU KNOW, PLEASE JUST GET US BACK ON THE AGENDA AS FAST AS PUBLICATION PROCESS ALLOWS. THAT'S WHAT I ASK.
01:55:38.457: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. PROCEDURALLY, I DON'T QUITE KNOW HOW TO DO THIS. MY SENSE AT THE TABLE IS THAT FIRST READING IS ACCEPTABLE. DOES ANYBODY OBJECT TO THAT? ENOUGH TO PUT IT TO A VOTE? LET'S KEEP IT AT FIRST READING THEN. ALL IN FAVOR OF B-2 AS AMENDED ON FIRST READING LOOKING FORWARD TO COME BACK ASAP ON SECOND READING? ALL IN FAVOR. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. C-1, AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND THE TITLE OF ALL SECTIONS --
01:56:12.391: >> Councilmember Lumm: MR. MAYOR CORK WE MAYBE --
01:56:14.192: >> Mayor Taylor: I WOULD LOVE TO DRIVE STUFF. I WANT TO PUT A LITTLE BIT OF PRESSURE ON THIS.
01:56:19.131: >> Councilmember Lumm: THIS IS GOING TO BE A LONGER ONE.
01:56:21.566: >> Mayor Taylor: I KNOW. THAT'S WHY I WANT TO PUT PRESSURE ON IT. BUT 9:00. WE'LL TAKE A SHORT BREAK. [ BREAK ]
02:04:28.585: >> Mayor Taylor: WE ARE BACK AFTER A SHORT BREAK. C-1 AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND THE TITLE OF ALL SECTIONS OF AND TO ADD -- AB ORDINANCE TO AMEND THE TITLE OF ALL SECTIONS OF AND TO ADD A NEW SECTION 7:613 TO CHAPTER 96, MEDICAL MARIJUANA FACILITIES TITLE VII OF THE CODE OF CITY OF ANN ARBOR. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD AND SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM. DISCUSSION, PLEASE, OF C-1. I WOULD LIKE TO GET THIS OFF BRIEFLY BY DESCRIBING -- PUT ME ON THE CLOCK, PLEASE. DESCRIBING A LITTLE BIT WHERE THIS LANDS. AS FOLKS NOW, WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE STATE LAW BY THE VOTERS, BACK WHEN, THE STATE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN PUTTING TOGETHER RULES AND REGULATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF LEGAL MARIJUANA INTO THE COMMUNITY. IN I BELIEVE, LATE JUNE, THEY PUT FORWARD THEIR FINAL RULES OR THE RULES THAT ARE GOING TO BE APPLICABLE AND WE HAVE SINCE BEEN PUTTING TOGETHER, STAFF HAS WITH THE PLANNING COMMISSION, PUTTING TOGETHER THESE RULES WHICH WE BELIEVE WOULD INTEGRATE THE NEW WAY OF SOCIAL USE AND RETAIL SALE OF MARIJUANA IN THE COMMUNITIES, INTERGREAT THAT INTO -- INTEGRATE THAT INTO THE MEDICAL MARRIAGE MARRIAGE FACILITIES IN THE -- MARIJUANA IN THE FACILITIES IN THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. WE ARE STRUCTURALLY UNDER SOME TIGHT TIME CONSTRAINTS BY STATE. WE HAVE A FIRST READING, SECOND READING STRUCTURE TO OUR ORDINANCES WHICH HAS BEEN -- FOR THOSE WATCHING AT HOME, WE WERE TALKING ABOUT IT AT OUR LAST AGENDA ITEM. WHAT THIS ALL MEANS, IF WE ARE TO FINALIZE THE ORDINANCES AND THE LIKE, ASSOCIATED WITH THE SALE OF RETAIL MARIJUANA IN ANN ARBOR, IF WE ARE GOING TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL BY THE END OF OCTOBER, BY NOVEMBER 1, THE STATE THAT THE DATE IS GOING TO START WITH LICENSES, WE NEED TO PASS SOMETHING TODAY, AND THEN HAVE THAT AT SECOND READING IN OCTOBER. THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO AMEND THIS ON THE -- HERE ARE PRESENT. THE OPPORTUNITIES TO AMEND IT LATER, AND KICKING IT BACK TO FIRST READING WOULD MESS UP OUR CALENDAR. AND SO THOSE ARE THE TIME CONSTRAINTS UNDER WHICH WE ARE OPERATING, BUT THAT SAID, JUST LIKE TO MOVE FORWARD AND IT OPEN UP FOR DISCUSSION, C-1, COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
02:06:58.836: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANKS, MR. MAYOR. TO REVIEW AGAIN WHERE WE ARE ON THIS, IN ADDITION TO WHAT YOU JUST SAID, WE RECEIVED TEASE TWO ORDINANCES LATE FRIDAY ON MARIJUANA FACILITIES. A TOPIC THAT'S VERY, VERY IMPORTANT TO THE COMMUNITY. THEY ARE LENGTHY, COMPLICATED ORDINANCES AND THEN ON SATURDAY, WE RECEIVED A COUPLE LEGAL ADVICE MEMOS. THEY WERE VERY HELPFUL BUT COUPLED WITH THE ORDINANCES THEMSELVES, I THINK IT'S TOO MUCH TO DIGEST IN TOO SHORT A TIME. AND, AGAIN, WITH ALL OF THIS COMING ON FRIDAY, COUNCIL DID NOT HAVE OUR NORMAL OPPORTUNITY TO ASK QUESTIONS. OUR QUESTIONS HAVE TO BE SUBMITTED BY NOON ON WEDNESDAY AND WE RECEIVED THIS LATE, AT THE END OF THE DAY ON FRIDAY AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, RESIDENTS HAVE NOT HAD A REAL OPPORTUNITY TO -- HAVE HAD ANY OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH IN. THERE WAS A PUBLIC HEARING AS I NOTED INITIALLY AT THE PLANNING COMMISSION, BUT THERE WERE NO SPEAKERS. WE KNOW FROM PAST DEBATES ON MEDICAL MARIJUANA FACILITIES, THAT IT'S A TOPIC OF CONSIDERABLE INTEREST TO OUR COMMUNITY AND OUR RESIDENTS. SO ON NOVEMBER 1st, AGAIN, THE STATE BEGINS TAKING APPLICATIONS FOR RECREATIONAL FACILITIES AND WE NEED TO, IN MY VIEW, DELIBERATELY AND THOUGHTFULLY DISCUSS AND PRESENT REGULATIONS AND RETAIN OUR ABILITY TO REGULATE THE NUMBER AND THE LOCATION OF THESE FACILITIES, AND WE'RE UNDER THIS DEADLINE. IT WOULD BE UNACCEPTABLE TO NOT RETAIN OUR ABILITY TO REGULATE THESE FACILITIES AND WE KNOW OUR -- WE HAVE A COUPLE OF OPTIONS TO PASS AND PUBLISH THESE ORDINANCES REGULATING FACILITIES BEFORE NOVEMB NOVEMBER 1st, OR TO ADOPT AN ORDINANCE TEMPORARILY TO OPT OUT, TEMPORARILY OPT OUT UNTIL SUCH TIME AS WE HAVE PASSED NEW ORDINANCES. AND IN TERMS OF PASSING NEW ORDINANCES, WE'RE TOLD THAT, YOU KNOW, AFTER TONIGHT, THREE DAYS AFTER WE GOT THIS, AND BEFORE HEARING FROM THE PUBLIC, WE CAN'T MAKE CHANGES AND STILL MEET THE NOVEMBER 1st TIMING. AND BY THE WAY, WE'RE ALSO TOLD THAT IN ADDITION TO PASSING NEW ORDINANCES WE ALSO SHOULD COME UP WITH A NEW COMPETITIVE PROCESS, NOT JUST THE FIRST COME, FIRST SERVE APPROACH THAT WE HAVE BEEN TAKING NECESSARILY, BUT A COMPETITIVE PROCESS, ANOTHER STATE REQUIREMENT TO ALLOW THE LIMITED NUMBER OF PERMITS THAT WE MAKE AVAILABLE. SO I THINK THAT'S JUST TOO MUCH TO DO IN TOO LITTLE TIME. NOT TO MENTION THAT IT'S AN ABSOLUTE INSULT TO RESIDENTS TO NOT ALLOW THEM TO ENGAGE ON SOMETHING THAT'S CLEARLY IMPORTANT TO THEM. SO I DO NOT VIEW THIS OPTION OF PASSING THESE ORDINANCES BEFORE NOVEMBER 1st AS A VIABLE OPTION IN MY VIEW AND WHY I THINK WE ARE LEFT WITH THE MOST SENSIBLE OPTION WHICH IS A TEMPORARY OPT OUT. I AGAIN THINK THAT THAT MAKES THE MOST SENSE FOR SEVERAL REASONS. IT ALLOWS TIME FOR US TO HAVE MORE CAREFUL CONSIDERATION OF THE PROPOSED ORDINANCE CHANGES. AND THAT ADOPTION OF AN ORDINANCE SHOULD NOT BE RUSHED SO THAT THE ORDINANCE CAN PROPERLY REFLECT COMMUNITY --
02:10:37.688: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER.
02:10:39.190: >> Councilmember Lumm: OKAY. ALL RIGHT. SO I THINK -- I WOULD LIKE TO ASK A QUESTION OF MR.  --
02:10:45.930: >> Mayor Taylor: THAT --
02:10:46.464: >> Mayor Taylor: CAN I ASK A --
02:10:51.369: >> Councilmember Lumm: CAN I ASK A QUESTION. I WOULD LIKE MR. McDONALD TO ADDRESS WHETHER OR NOT AN OPT OUT ORDINAOR OCTOB OCTOBER 7th WOULD PROVIDE THE ADEQUATE TIME NEEDED.
02:11:04.582: >> YES. IF THE OPT OUT ORDINANCE IS HELD ON FIRST READING ON OCTOBER 7th THAT WOULD GIVE US AN OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE -- IT WOULD GIVE COUNCIL THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THE SECOND READING AT THE SECOND MEETING IN OCTOBER. AND THEN IT WOULD BE EFFECTIVE UPON PUBLICATION. IT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN THESE ORDINANCES WHICH HAVE SPECIFIC ENFORCEMENT PROVISIONS THAT REQUIRE AN ADDITIONAL TEN DAYS AFTER PUBLICATION. THAT'S WHY THEY CANNOT WAIT, BUT IF COUNCIL WOULD WANT A TEMPORARY OPT OUT ORDINANCE, IT COULD BE BROUGHT AT OCTOBER 7th AND WOULD YOU HAVE THE ORDINANCE IN PLACE BY THE NOVEMBER 1st ACCEPTANCE DATE.
02:11:42.253: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. COUNCILMEMBER NELSON?
02:11:43.888: >> Councilmember Nelson: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I -- I SUSPECT THAT COUNCILMEMBER LUMM AND I LAND ON OPPOSITE SIDES OF THIS ISSUE, WHEN IT'S ULTIMATELY DECIDED BUT I ULTIMATELY SHARE A LOT OF FRUSTRATION IN TERMS OF THE TIMELINE PUT IN FRONT OF US. I HAD A QUESTION THAT I SUBMITTED IN WRITING A FEW DAYS AGO AND I DIDN'T GET AN ANSWER TO IT. I'M GOING TO ASK IT NOW. I'M -- COUNCIL HAS BEEN LOBBIED A BIT ON THIS ISSUE, AND I'M JUST WONDERING HOW WE LET THIS DEADLINE GET SO CLOSE. WE DIDN'T HAVE, LIKE, COUNCILMEMBER LUMM MENTIONED, WE DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO SUBMIT WRITTEN QUESTIONS TO IT. I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE SUBMITTED WRITTEN QUESTIONS TO IT. AND I GUESS I'M TRY TO UNDERSTAND, IS THE CHALLENGE IN HOW LONG IT TOOK OUR LEGAL DEPARTMENT TO MAKE THIS -- TO WRITE UP THIS DRAFT? IS IT -- DID SOME -- DID WE COLLECTIVELY HON COUNCIL DROP THE BALL IN NOT PUSHING IT ON AN EARLIER AGENDA. HOW DID THIS HAPPEN? I WANT TO -- IF THERE ARE LESSONS TO BE LEARNED, I WOULD LIKE TO LEARN THEM SO THAT THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN, BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE WE DO -- WE ARE UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE NOW AN I KNOW MANY OF US AT THIS TABLE WANT TO SUPPORT THIS AND WE DON'T WANT TO OPT OUT. BUT THERE'S QUITE A LOT THAT WE ARE BEING TOLD WE ABSOLUTELY MUST SORT OUT TONIGHT AND WE HAD LIKE THREE DAYS TO THINK ABOUT IT. SO THAT'S KIND OF MY QUESTION. HOW DID WE GET HERE?
02:13:12.943: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. McDONALD?
02:13:13.577: >> I WILL BE HAPPY TO ADDRESS IT.
02:13:15.980: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
02:13:17.815: >> I'M LOOKING AT THE ADMINISTRATOR.
02:13:19.550: >> City Admin. Lazarus: I WANTED TO BE VERY CLEAR THAT I'M RESPONSIBLE NOR GETTING THINGS ON THE AGENDA IN A TIMELY MANNER. AND I TRIED TO RESPOND TO CONCERNS FROM COUNCIL -- FROM SOME COUNCILMEMBERS WOULD WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE -- WHO WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DIDN'T GET INTO A POSITION TO OPT OUT. SO THE TIME FRAME CONTRACTED. I THINK WE MANAGED THE CLOCK AS BEST WE, COULD BUT ULTIMATELY ANY RESPO RESPONSIBILITY LIES W.
02:13:44.775: >> AND I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT, BY INDICATING THAT THE MEMO THAT -- THAT THE COMMUNITY SERVICES ADMINISTRATOR, THE PLANNING ADMINISTRATOR PANE MYSELF SENT THROUGH THE ADMINISTRATOR BACK IN AUGUST INDICATED AT THAT TIME THAT WE THOUGHT THAT THERE WAS REALLY NOT ENOUGH TIME TO GO FORWARD WITH THIS PROCESS IN AN EFFECTIVE WAY. AND WE WERE SUGGESTING THEN THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE AN OPT OUT. SO THAT WAS REALLY KIND OF THE DEFAULT POSITION IS THAT THERE WAS THE EMERGENCY RULES CAME OUT. WE WERE ANALYZING THOSE RULES. IT'S 65 PAGES OF RULES DOESN'T ANSWER ALL OF THE QUESTIONS, BUT OUR ORDINANCE -- OUR ZONING ORDINANCE, ACTUALLY -- UNLIKE MANY OF THE OTHER USES THAT WE HAVE, WHERE THERE IS JUST THE ZONING ENABLING ACT BEHIND THEM AND KIND OF COMMUNITY NEEDS, BUT THESE ORDINANCES ACTUALLY INCORPORATE THREE DIFFERENT SETS OF -- OF STATE LAW REGARDING MEDICAL MARIJUANA. THERE WAS A FIRST MEDICAL MARIJUANA SECTION AND THEN THE FACILITIES ACT AND NOW THE TAXATION ACT AND SO ALL OF THOSE HAVE TO BE INCORPORATED INTO -- INTO THE PROVISIONS THAT YOU SEE BEFORE YOU AND SO THAT IS WHERE SOME OF THE PRESSURE CAME AND INDICATING -- AND THAT'S WHY WE INDICATED BACK THEN THAT WE WOULD THINK THAT THIS WAS A SORT OF AMBITIOUS AND MAYBE TOO AMBITIOUS TO TRY TO DO BY THE TIME THE APPLICATIONS WERE GOING TO BE ACCEPTED IN NOVEMBER. ESSENTIALLY WE HAVE TIME TO -- IT AND SOME OF THOSE LIMITS COME FROM THE FACT THAT WE SIMPLY HAVE LOTS OF NOTICES AND PUBLICATION DATES THAT HAVE TO BE DONE. AND THAT'S WHY WE INDICATED IN NOVEMBER, THAT A TEMPORARY OPT OUT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE.
02:15:37.788: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER EATON?
02:15:38.756: >> Councilmember Eaton: THANK YOU. SO I WANT TO SAY THAT I SHARE THE CONCERNS OF COUNCILMEMBERS LUMM AND NELSON ABOUT HOW LATE THIS CAME TO US. BUT I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THIS IS A FIRST READING. WE CAN PASS THIS ON FIRST READING. AT OUR NEXT MEETING, WE CAN PASS AN OPT OUT ORDINANCE ON FIRST READING. THEY BOTH COME BACK T US FOR A SECOND READING AT THE SAME MEETING, AND WE CAN MAKE THAT DECISION AT THAT FORK IN THE ROAD, AND IT WOULD GIVE US TIME TO DIGEST THE LEGAL ADVICE THAT WE HAVE GOTTEN AND TO ASK THE QUESTIONS THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO ASK IN PREPARATION FOR TONIGHT'S MEETING. I PERSONALLY, AM NOT LEANING TOWARDS OPTING OUT BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I UNDERSTAND BETTER THE IMPLICATIONS OF PASSING THIS -- THIS ORDINANCE ON OUR SUBSEQUENT DECISIONS. SO I'M GOING TO VOTE TO PASS THIS ON FIRST READING TONIGHT. I WILL CONSIDER PASSING AN OPT OUT ORDINANCE AT THE NEXT MEETING, AND THEN WE'LL FACE THE TOUGHER QUESTION WHEN THEY BOTH COME BACK FOR A SECOND READING. THANK YOU.
02:16:56.734: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
02:16:57.968: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE WHAT MY COLLEAGUES HAD TO SHARE AND I UNDERSTAND THE LIMITATIONS THAT STAFF HAS TO WORK WITH. A LOT OF THIS IS COMING FROM THE STATE. A LOT OF WHAT THE STATE DOES ISN'T VERY CLEAR FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE TO USE THE STATUTES THAT THEY WRITE AND PASS. THAT BEING SAID, I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT ANN ARBOR HAS A LONG HISTORY WITH TRYING TO DECONT DECRIMINALIZE MARIJUA. IT STARTED 50 YEARS AGO. AND THE MESSAGE OF THE OPTING OUT WOULD HAVE A VERY NEGATIVE IMPACT, I THINK, ON THE MOVEMENT THAT HAD BEEN STARTED 50 YEARS AGO. SO I APPRECIATE COUNCILMEMBERS' EXPLANATIONS, ARTICULATE EXPLANATION. PROCEDURES AND PROCESSES AND THE OPTIONS THAT WE HAVE, AND I WILL SUPPORT THIS AT FIRST READING. SO FORTUNATELY, HAVE A BYE WEEK IN SEPTEMBER AND IT MAKES IT ALL WORK IN TIME, IF THAT IS WHAT COUNCIL WISHES TO DO. AND I WILL JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT, BUT I JUST -- LASTLY, I WILL SAY THAT I'M JUST CONCERNED WITH, YOU KNOW, HAVING, YOU KNOW, ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES MADE TO THIS, WE KNOW IT CAN'T BE DONE. AND IT WILL -- IT WILL HAVE TO REVERT BACK TO FIRST READING AND WE WON'T MAKE THE DEADLINE. SO WHAT WE WILL BE LOOKING AT DOES HAVE A SERIOUS IMPACT AND, OF COURSE, WE ARE TAKING IT SERIOUS AND WE HAVE A CLOSED SESSION -- OR NOT A CLOSED SESSION BUT A WORK SESSION NEXT MONDAY TO LEARN MORE ABOUT IT. SO AT THIS POINT, I DON'T REALLY FAVOR OPTING OUT BECAUSE OF THE REVERBERATIONS THAT MESSAGE HAS AND WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO, AND WE'LL HAVE TO LEARN REAL QUICK, BUT I WILL LEAVE IT AT THAT.
02:19:13.837: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM AND THEN GRISWOLD AND THEN BANISTER.
02:19:17.508: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU. I JUST SENT YOU A MOTION AND AT THIS TIME, I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE THAT WE TABLE AGENDA ITEM C-1 AND C-2 AND DIRECT CITY STAFF TO DRAFT FOR COUNCIL CONSIDERATION AT THE  OCTOBER 7th MEETING FOR A TEMPORARY OPT OUT OF THE MICHIGAN REGULATION AND TAX OF MARIJUANA ACT FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROVIDING SUFFICIENT TIME TO OBTAIN COMMUNITY INPUT AND TO REVISE AND IMPLEMENT THE RELATED ORDINANCES.
02:19:46.704: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE A SECOND? SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
02:19:50.474: >> Councilmember Lumm: AND IF I MAY?
02:19:52.876: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
02:19:53.377: >> Councilmember Lumm: JUST TO THE MOTION. I THINK THAT -- THAT THIS IS NECESSARY BECAUSE IT WOULD ALLOW THE ADDITIONAL TIME FOR MORE CAREFUL CONSIDERATION OF THE PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENTS, WHICH I THINK IS ALSO ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT GIVEN THE LACK OF CLARITY OF THE MICHIGAN REGULATION AND TAXATION ACT OF MARIJUANA ACT. THERE'S ALSO, YOU KNOW, ALWAYS THE -- THE POSSIBILITY THAT THERE COULD BE LEGAL CHALLENGES TO ANY ORDINANCES THE CITY ADOPTS REGARDING THESE USES AND GIVEN THE SCHEDULE, THERE WOULDN'T BE OPPORTUNITIES TO MAKE CHANGES AFTER TONIGHT'S MEETING. AND I THINK THE ORDINANCE SHOULD PROPERLY REFLECT ANY COMMUNITY CONCERNS AND WE KNOW WE HAVE NO ADOPT A COMPETITIVE PROCESS. WE HAVEN'T DONE THAT YET. AND THAT WILL TAKE SOME TIME TO DESIGN A COMPETITIVE PROCESS. MOST IMPORTANTLY, WE NEED TO HAVE I ACONVERS A CONVERSATION S AND I APPRECIATE THAT EVERYONE AT THE ADMIN COMMITTEE WAS SUPPORTIVE OF SCHEDULING A WORK SESSION FOR THE 23rd, BUT I -- I REALLY DO THINK THAT THIS TIME IS NEEDED. IT'S TEMPORARY. AND IN WILL ALLOW US TO DO THIS IN A -- YOU KNOW TO DISCUSS AND ADOPT REGS IN A DELIBERATIVE, THOUGHTFUL AND INFORMED WAY. THANKS.
02:21:31.341: >> Mayor Taylor: DISCUSSION ON THE TABLING. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
02:21:33.644: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. SO IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS WOULD ALLOW US TO SYNC UP THOSE TWO -- THE FIRST READING OF THIS AGAIN, AND THE -- YOU KNOW, THE POTENTIAL FOR A LIMITED OPT OUT IF WE MOVE THIS TO THE SECOND MEETING? NO? THEN THEY WOULD BE IN SYNC, WOULD THEY NOT? FIRST READING OF THIS AND FIRST READING --
02:21:56.233: >> Mayor Taylor: NO, THAT'S NOT HOW THAT WOULD WORK. THE METHOD TO DO THAT IS VOTE THAT FORWARD AND THEN IT WOULD COME BACK SLOWER THAN THE OPT OUT ORDINANCE WHICH WE WOULD VOTE ON AT THE FIRST READING ON THE 7th, AND THEN SECOND MEETING IN OCTOBER WHEN THIS WOULD COME BACK TO US AT THE SECOND MEETING IN OCTOBER. SO WE WOULD BE HEARING BOTH ORDINANCES CONCURRENTLY.
02:22:18.055: >> Councilmember Hayner: RIGHT. OKAY.
02:22:21.892: >> I DON'T THINK THAT IS CORRECT.
02:22:23.327: >> Mayor Taylor: THAT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING.
02:22:25.028: >> WELL, THERE'S -- SO THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS. SO IF -- I WILL SPEAK FIRST TOWARDS THE PROCESS AS SET OUT RIGHT NOW WITHOUT THE MOTION. THIS ITEM WOULD BE -- THIS ITEM, AS WELL AS THE U.D.C. AMENDMENTS IF APPROVED AT FIRST READING BECAUSE OF THE ADDITIONAL WEEK WE HAVE, WE HAVE ENOUGH TIME UNDER THE STATE REQUIREMENTS TO DO THE EFFECTIVE ZONING NOTICES SO THAT SECOND READING COULD BE OCTOBER 7th. THAT WOULD ALLOW ACTION AT THAT NIGHT IF COUNCIL WANTED TO AND THAT WOULD ALLOW BOTH -- WE HAVE A TEN-DAY NOTICE PERIOD AS WELL AS TEN DAYS AFTER THE EFFECTIVE -- AFTER THE NOTICE BEFORE IT CAN BE EFFECTIVE. SO THAT WILL -- THAT KIND OF TAKES US CLOSE TO THE END OF THE MONTH. IF -- IF A MOTION TO POSTBONE PE THIS TO ANOTHER MEETING HAPPENS AND THAT MEETING IS FIRST READING, AND THAT'S FIRST READING OF THESE ORDINANCES WE WOULD NORMALLY REQUIRE A 15-DAY NOTICE AND SO IF IT'S OCTOBER 7th, YOU WOULDN'T SEE THE U.D.C. AND THE PERMIT ORDINA COME BACK FOR SECOND READING UNTIL -- THE FIRST MEETING IN NOVEMBER BECAUSE OF THE NECESSARY NOTICE IN BETWEEN THE TWO MEETINGS. AND SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT'S CLEAR, THAT IT'S DIFFERENT FROM THE -- THE OPT OUT ORDINANCE BECAUSE THE OPT OUT NOTICE DOESN'T HAVE THE SAME NOTICE AND PUBLICATION. IF WE BRING IT ON THE 7th, AS IS SUGGESTED HERE, WE DON'T NEED TWO WEEKS BEFORE WE TALK ABOUT IT AGAIN, OR 15 DAYS. IT CAN JUST COME TO THE NEXT MEETING, THE SECOND MEETING IN OCTOBER, BE PUT IN PLACE IMMEDIATELY UPON PUBLICATION, AND THEN THAT'S -- THAT'S THE WAY THAT YOU WOULD BEAT THE NOVEMBER 1st DATE.
02:24:14.571: >> Councilmember Hayner: OKAY. I THINK THE INTENT WAS THAT THEY WERE -- THEY WOULD BOTH TALL FAL TOGETHER IN SECOND READING.
02:24:25.682: >> Mayor Taylor: IT'S NOT PROCEDURALLY POSSIBLE. WE COULD HAVE A FIRST READING ON THE OPT OUT ORDINANCE BUT WE CAN'T GET TWO SECOND READINGS AT THE SAME MEETING, CORRECT?
02:24:34.091: >> THAT IS CORRECT.
02:24:35.292: >> Councilmember Hayner:  AND READINGS AT THE SAME TIME MEETING.
02:24:40.397: >> Mayor Taylor: WE COULDN'T GET THEM ON OCTOBER 7th IF WE HOPE TO HAVE THIS EFFECTIVE BY NOVEMBER 1st, WHICH IS THE IMPERATIVE.
02:24:49.172: >> Councilmember Hayner: OKAY. SO I WILL NOT SPEAK ANY MORE TO THIS TABLING THEN. I WANT TO SAVE MY COMMENTS FOR THE BODY OF THE -- OF WHAT'S BEFORE US.
02:25:01.651: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION ON THE TABLING. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
02:25:04.888: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I MEAN EFFECTIVELY, YOU ALMOST EFFECTIVELY KILLED THIS BY POSTPONING IT OR TABLING IT. THIS IS FIRST READING. IT STILL GIVES THE PUBLIC PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE US BEFORE THE SECOND READING WHICH IS THREE WEEKS FROM TODAY. SO POSTPONING IT, YOU KNOW, AGAIN, ISN'T WHAT I WOULD BE IN FAVOR OF, WON'T BE IN FAVOR OF AND URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO VOTE WITH ME.
02:25:32.749: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION?
02:25:34.051: >> I HAVE A QUESTION.
02:25:35.285: >> Mayor Taylor: I HAVE GRAND AND THEN LUMM AND THEN PERHAPS WE CAN MOVE FORWARD ON THIS TABLING.
02:25:42.926: >> Councilmember Grand: I'M ALSO NOT SUPPORTING THE TABLING FOR THE REASONS MADE BY MY COLLEAGUES. I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE SOME AMENDMENTS THAT WILL BE COMING UP THIS EVENING. SO IF WE COULD GET TO THOSE, THAT WOULD BE FANTASTIC!
02:25:54.137: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM ON THE TABLING.
02:25:57.140: >> Councilmember Lumm: I HAVE A QUESTION FOR MR. McDONALD. SO, AGAIN, WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY OPPORTUNITIES TO ASK QUESTIONS BECAUSE WE GOT THIS SO LATE. AND I HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS. I DON'T KNOW IF THESE QUESTIONS WILL ULTIMATELY LEAD TO SOME AMENDMENTS AND THE AMENDMENTS MAY OR MAY NOT BE SIGNIFICANT -- I'M ASKING A QUESTION.
02:26:27.237: >> Mayor Taylor: ON THE TABLING.
02:26:28.972: >> Councilmember Lumm: I'M ASKING A QUESTION.
02:26:30.674: >> Mayor Taylor: YOU KNOW WE ARE TRYING TO KEEP THE TWO TIMES ON EACH --
02:26:33.610: >> Councilmember Lumm: RIGHT, BUT QUESTIONS WE CAN -- WE CAN DO Q&A OF STAFF.
02:26:37.347: >> Mayor Taylor: ON THE TABLING.
02:26:39.850: >> Councilmember Lumm: I WILL TRY TO WEAVE IT IN, I GUESS, BUT -- THIS IS THE ONLY TIME BECAUSE WE --
02:26:45.622: >> Mayor Taylor: IF THE TABLING PASSES IT WILL BE THE ONLY TIME IF THE TABLING SUCCEEDS --
02:26:50.360: >> Councilmember Lumm: I THINK THIS WOULD HELP TO ILLUSTRATE WHY TABLING. NONE OF US HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ASK QUESTIONS. MAYBE WE ALL KNOW THE ANSWERS. SO I LOOKED AT THE MINUTES, MR. McDONALD, FROM THE AUGUST 20th PLANNING COMMISSION MEETING. AND IF, FOR EXAMPLE, I WANTED TO MAKE AN AMENDMENT REQUIRING SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE FOR MARIJUANA MICROBUSINESSES, BECAUSE PLANNING COMMISSION -- THERE'S NO RATIONALE PROVIDED. THERE'S NOTHING IN THE MINUTES ABOUT THIS. FOR SOME REASON, THEY PROPOSED AN S.E.U. ONLY FOR THE CONSUMPTION FACILITY. IF I WAS TO PROPOSE AN AMENDMENT TO REQUIRE AN S.E.U., SO IT'S NOT JUST A -- A -- I DON'T KNOW, AN APPROVED WITHOUT AN S.E.U. NOTICE, FOR MARIJUANA MICROBUSINESSES, WOULD THAT BE A SUBSTANTIVE CHANGE? TO PUSH IT BACK TO A FIRST READING, FOR EXAMPLE? IF THAT AMENDMENT CAME UP ON OCTOBER 7th?
02:28:14.844: >> SO YOU ARE SAYING SOMETHING THAT --
02:28:17.914: >> Councilmember Lumm: I'M GIVING YOU AN EXAMPLE.
02:28:19.249: >> I THINK -- I GUESS WHAT I WILL SAY IS WE -- YOU KNOW, WE UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS -- THAT THERE'S SOME LIMITED TIME HERE. WE WILL ANSWER ALL THE QUESTIONS THAT ARE PRESENTED TO US AND ALSO WE WILL MAKE A DETERMINATION AS TO THE BEST WAY TO DO IT. AND I WILL SAY IF THERE'S A WAY TO DO WITHOUT REQUIRING AN ADDITIONAL READING. IT'S KIND OF HARD FOR ME TO -- I WILL JUST SAY THIS, IT'S KIND OF HARD FOR ME TO SORT OF PICK THROUGH THE --
02:28:49.379: >> Councilmember Lumm: I'M GIVING YOU A HYPOTHETICAL. SORRY WHITE SOX. WOULD A SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE FOR MEDICAL MICROBUSINESSES, IF THAT AMENDMENT WERE PROPOSED ON OCTOBER 7th, WOULD THAT BUMP IT BACK TO A FIRST READING?
02:29:03.927: >> A SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE? AS OPPOSED TO RIGHT NOW IT'S A PERMITTED USE IN A CERTAIN DISTRICT.
02:29:10.133: >> Councilmember Lumm: CORRECT. THEY ONLY PROPOSED THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE FOR CONSUMPTION FACILITY DESIGNATION.
02:29:17.641: >> I WILL SAY THE MOST CONSERVATIVE THOUGHT NOW UTILITY WITHOUTGIVING ADDITIONAL TIME, D SAY IT LIKELY WOULD.
02:29:28.151: >> Mayor Taylor: YOU ARE AT THREE MINUTES. FURTHER DISCUSSION ON THE TABLING. COUNCILMEMBER NELSON?
02:29:32.656: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I WANT TO COMMENT THAT I HEAR WHAT COUNCILMEMBER LUMM IS SAYING, AND I -- ALL OF THE -- ALL OF THE RATIONALE THAT YOU OFFER, I WOULD ORDINARILY SAY THAT THAT SUPPORTS TABLING, BUT IN THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION, WHAT I'M LOOKING AT IS THE NUMBER OF MUNICIPALITIES ACROSS THE STATE, IT'S OVER 800 AND SOME, WHO HAVE OPTED OUT, SENDING THE MESSAGE THAT THIS STATE LAW IS NOT REALLY GOING TO BE IMPLEMENTED BY ANYONE. AND IF ANY MUNICIPAL IS GOING TO IMPLEMENT THIS LAW, IT STRIKES ME THAT ANN ARBOR IS THE ONE TO DO IT. I DO NOT SUPPORT TABLING IT JUST BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO PASS THIS AT FIRST READING. I SUSPECT THAT ULTIMATELY, WE MAY IN THE PASSAGE OF TIME, WE HAVE -- I'M IN SUPPORT OF PASSING IT AT FIRST READING AND THEN POTENTIALLY CHANGING ITS SUBSTANTIALIVELY AND IT HAVING TO GO BACK TO FIRST READING AND ULTIMATELY HAVING TO TEMPORARILY TO VOTE TO OPT OUT BUT THE INITIAL MESSAGE THAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT FOR ANN ARBOR TO MAKE THAT WE ARE READY AND WILLING TO IMPLEMENT THE STATE LAW AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE WILL DO. THAT'S MY REASON BEHIND NOT SUPPORTING YOUR MOTION TO TABLE BUT I DO UNDERSTAND YOUR ALL OF YOUR READING UNDER ANOTHER CIRCUMSTANCE I WOULD SUPPORT THAT.
02:30:56.206: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE TABLING. ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
02:31:04.381: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES.
02:31:05.115: >> Councilmember Bannister: NO.
02:31:06.750: >> Councilmember Griswold: NO.
02:31:11.020: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES.
02:31:12.255: >> Councilmember Grand: NO. COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN, ABSENT.
02:31:17.293: >> Mayor Taylor: NO.
02:31:17.827: >> Councilmember Eaton: NO.
02:31:18.428: >> Councilmember Nelson:  NO.
02:31:20.597: >> Councilmember Smith: NO.
02:31:21.197: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: NEGATIVE.
02:31:23.299: >> Clerk Beaudry: THE MOTION FAILS.
02:31:24.834: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN MOTION. I THINK I HAD -- HAVE WE HAD GGRISWOLD YET? GRISWOLD AND THEN BANNISTER.
02:31:40.216: >> Councilmember Griswold: I'M NOT GOING TO SUPPORT AN OPTING OUT. ANN ARBOR IS A LEADER IN THIS AREA, AND STAFF AND THE PUBLIC AND COUNCILMEMBERS NEED TO RECOGNIZE TO THE OCCASION AND GET THE JOB DONE.
02:31:54.564: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
02:31:55.865: >> Councilmember Bannister:  I AGREE WITH COUNCILWOMAN GRISWOLD ON THAT. AND I WANTED TO CALL FOR MAYBE A RESERVE -- WE TALKED ABOUT BRINGING BACK THE LICENSE REVIEW BOARD OR THE MARIJUANA COMMISSION OF THE PAST, AND I THINK WE SHOULD DO THAT SO THAT WE WOULDN'T HAVE THIS KIND OF DISCUSSION. I THINK THIS COULD HELP US AVOID THAT, BUT IN LIEU OF A BOARD OR COMMISSION, I DEFERRED TO SOME OF THE LOCAL BUSINESS LEADERS IN THIS AREA AND ELECTED OFFICIALS AT THIS STATE LEVEL, AND THEY ARE URGING THE OPT IN AVENUE AND FOR THE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY AND ALSO THAT IT IS A WELL-KNOWN HELPFUL, SAFE PLANT AND WE WOULD JUST LIKE TO REMIND EVERYONE THAT THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR PASSED LEGALIZATION AT 78%.
02:32:55.492: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
02:32:56.626: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: SORRY.
02:32:58.628: >> Councilmember Lumm: I HAD MY HAND UP.
02:32:59.596: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I'M GOING TO ACTUALLY DEFER THIS, IF I COULD TO COUNC SMITH, WHO CAN MAYBE -- IF THAT'S OKAY WITH YOU.
02:33:09.405: >> Mayor Taylor: I HAVE ACTUALLY -- I THIS FORGOTTEN ABOUT COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
02:33:15.778: >> Mayor Taylor: SO IT'S LUMM AND THEN SMITH.
02:33:17.814: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANKS. AND THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER NELSON FOR YOUR COMMENTS. I APPRECIATE THAT S SINCERELY. NO ONE IS TALKING ABOUT AN OPT OUT. THIS IS A TEMPORARY OPT OUT. THIS IS SO NOT REMOTELY READY FOR PRIME TIME AND, YES, WE HAVE BEEN LOBBIED. THE MARIJUANA PROPRIETORS, BUSINESSES ARE A VERY ACTIVE GROUP AND WE HEAR FROM THEM. DO WE HEAR FROM, YOU KNOW, JOHN AND JANE DOE. NO ONE SHOWED UP AT THE PLANNING COMMISSION MEETING. WE OWE IT TO THE COMMUNITY TO HEAR FROM THEM AS WELL. WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE MEDICAL MARIJUANA ORDINANCE. AND THE COMMUNITY CAME OUT QUITE SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER THAT WAS PASSED AND SO WE PROPOSED SOME ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS THAT DID NOT FLY AT THE TIME, BUT SOME DID. SOME ADJUSTMENTS WERE MADE AND I GUARANTEE YOU, WE WILL HEAR, JUST AS WE DID MEDICAL MARIJUANA FACILITIES, WE HEARD -- WHICH IS WHY WE THEN ADDED AN AMENDMENT TO REQUIRE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE NOTICE OF THE NEIGHBORHOODS BECAUSE OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING. WE AS COUNCILMEMBERS WERE HEARING FROM FOLKS WHEN THESE WERE POPPING UP IN THE PLANNING COMMISSION AGENDA. I WOULD DIRECT PEO TO CONTACT PLANNING STAFF AND THE PLANNING COMMISSION. SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE APPROVALS DO NOT COME TO CITY COUNCIL, BUT AT LEAST FOLKS RECEIVE A NOTICE AND THAT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTIFY PEOPLE, NOT TO DO ANYTHING WITHOUT THEIR NOTICE. SO THAT WILL OCCUR AGAIN, I'M SURE. BUT NO ONE IS TALKING ABOUT AN OPT OUT. IT'S A TEMPORARY OPT OUT TO GET IT RIGHT. AND WHAT WE HAVE BEFORE US IS NOT READY FOR PRIME TIME AND I WILL BE ASKING A LOT OF QUESTIONS AND, AGAIN, THANK YOU COUNCILMEMBER NELSON. IT MAY MOVE IT BACK TO A FIRST READING. AND BECAUSE I, IN FACT, DID REACH OUT ABOUT RESURRECTING, AND SEVERAL OF YOU WERE ON THIS EMAIL. I SENT A COUPLE OF THEM ABOUT THIS TO RESURRECT THE COMMITTEE TO REVIEW WHAT WAS HAPPENING AT THE STATE LEVEL AND TO, YEAH, RESURRECT THIS COMMITTEE. BUT I GOT PUSHBACK ON IT. IT DIDN'T HAPPEN. SO HERE WE ARE. AND I JUST THINK IT'S CRITICAL TO GET IT RIGHT. AND LET'S FACE IT, COMING UP WITH A COMPETITIVE PROCESS, THAT WILL TAKE SOME WORK. WE NEED THAT TIME. THANKS.
02:35:50.733: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER SMITH.
02:35:51.567: >> Councilmember Smith: I THINK OUR EXPERIENCE IN COMING UP WITH OUR MEDICAL MARIJUANA REGULATIONS IS A GOOD GUIDE POST AND I THINK WE ALL HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT THE STATE IS NOT ALWAYS AN EASY PARTNER TO DEAL WITH, PARTICULARLY CONCERNING THIS ISSUE. RULES CHANGE QUICKLY. THEY CHANGE WITH VERY LITTLE CONSULTATION WITH US. AND THIS IS NOT A SET OF REGULATIONS THAT'S CHISELED IN STONE. IF THERE ARE THINGS THAT WE WANT TO CHANGE IN DECEMBER, THEN WE SHOULD CHANGE THEM. I THINK THAT MOVING FORWARD ON THIS IS IMPORTANT. I THINK OUR COMMUNITY HAS SPOKEN TO US VERY CLEARLY. MORE CLEARLY THAN PERHAPS ON ANY OTHER ISSUE THAT THEY WANT US TO MOVE IN THIS DIRECTION. SO I WOULD JUST HOPE THAT WE CAN KEEP IN MIND THAT NOTHING THAT WE DO, NO MATTER HOW LONG WE TAKE IS GOING TO BE PERFECT. EVERYTHING IS GOING TO REQUIRE ADJUSTMENT AND MODIFICATION AND ANALYSIS AS WE GO FORWARD. THAT'S WHAT THESE THINGS DO. SO THERE WILL BE A SLEW OF AMENDMENTS COMING ON THE NEXT ISSUE, SHOULD THIS PASS, BUT I THINK I AM TOTALLY IN SUPPORT OF MOVING THIS FORWARD.
02:37:05.341: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
02:37:07.143: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. I JUST BELIEVE THAT THE EXPERIENCE THAT WE HAVE HAD WITH THE MEDICAL MARIJUANA BUSINESSES SINCE THEY HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO DO BUSINESS IN ANN ARBOR, EVEN BEFORE IT WAS, YOU KNOW, LEGAL, THE BUSINESS OWNERS AND THE COMMUNITY HAVE DEMONSTRATED BEING RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS OWNERS, BEING RESPONSIBLE COMMUNITY MEMBERS. I HAVEN'T HEARD VERY MUCH IN THE WAY OF THESE THINGS -- THESE BUSINESSES, THESE ENTITIES, PROVIDERS CAUSING DISRUPTION. I THINK THEY HAVE DONE A VERY GOOD JOB IN SELF-REGULATING SINCE THERE'S SO LITTLE REGULATION ON THEIR BUSINESS, ESPECIALLY PRIOR TO THE STATE PASSING THIS. AND I BELIEVE THAT THEY KNOW THAT ALL EYES AND EARS WILL BE WATCHING THEM AND THEY DON'T WANT ANY OF THOSE CRITICISMS TO -- TO GET -- TO GO VIRAL OR TO GET BIGGER. THEY WANT TO TAKE CARE OF THINGS AND NIP THINGS IN THE BUD AND NOT HAVE THEM -- NO PUN INTENDED. NOT -- THEY WANT TO BE GOOD BUSINESS AND COMMUNITY PARTNERS AND THEY HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT. SO I JUST WANT TO GO ON RECORD SAYING THAT, THAT EVEN WITHOUT STRICTER REGULATIONS AND SUCH THAT THEY HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE BY AND LARGE.
02:38:52.181: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
02:38:54.350: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU. I FORWARDED THE CLERK A SECTION THAT I WOULD LIKE TO PROPOSE AN AMENDMENT FOR, IT'S SECTION 7:604, CITY PERMIT REQUIRED, NUMBER OF PERMITS AVAILABLE. AND THIS GETS TO THIS IDEA THAT I AGREE WITH COUNCILWOMAN LUMM THAT THIS IS NOT READY FOR PRIME TIME. I MEAN, WE DO -- WE HAVE AN OVERSIGHT. I SIT ON THE LIQUOR LICENSE REVIEW BOARD, BUT ARE WE NOT GOING TO FORM A -- YOU KNOW, A MARIJUANA LICENSE REVIEW BOARD. I DON'T HAVE THE LANGUAGE IN FRONT OF THAT, I DON'T KNOW IF IT WILL BE SUBSTANTIVE OR SEPARATE FROM THIS ISSUE BEFORE US. IN THIS CASE, I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE NO MAXIMUM LEVEL OF PERMITS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WITH GROWER PROCESSER, TRANSPORTER, PROVISIONING CENTER WHICH WE HAVE CAPPED AT 28, BASED ON OUR EXPERIENCE WITH THE MEDICAL MARIJUANA PROVISIONING, BUT THE SAFETY COMPLIANCE FACILITY, THE MICRO BUSINESS AND DESIGNATED CONSUMPTION ALL SET AT NO MAXIMUM. AND WITH 800 SOME OTHER MUNICIPALITIES OPTING OUT OF THIS, AND, YOU KNOW, THAT'S GOING TO DRIVE BUSINESS TO A CITY THAT APPEARS TO BE COMMITTED TO HELPING THIS GO THROUGH. NOW, I'M NOT REALLY BUYING THE IDEA THAT 78% SUPPORT FOR PROP 1 COMMITS US TO SOME KIND OF THING, BECAUSE PEOPLE VOTED FOR PROP 1 FOR ALL KINDS OF REASONS. I VOTED FOR PROP 1 BECAUSE I HAVE SUPPORTED DECRIMINALIZATION SINCE HIGH SCHOOL. AND SO THERE'S A REASON. I DIDN'T VOTE FOR PROP 1 TO HAVE 600 DISTRIBUTION AND CONSUMPTION FACILITIES IN MY COMMUNITY. I HAVE HAD PEOPLE COME UP TO ME SAYING THEYAVE LEGITIMATE CONCERNS ABOUT THE PLACEMENT OF THESE AND THE LEGITIMATE CONCERNS ABOUT LARGE MONEY FLOWING TO THE CITIES THAT DO ALLOW THIS USE AND IT DRIVING OUT OTHER BUSINESSES THAT SERVE A BROADER PORTION OF THE COMMUNITY. AND SO I'M SUGGESTING WE PUT A LIMIT ON THIS IN KEEPING WITH -- I DON'T NECESSARILY AGREE WITH THIS APPROACH BUT IN KEEPING WITH COUNCILMEMBER SMITH SAID, WE CAN ALWAYS COME BACK AND CHANGE IT, WHEN WE COME UP WITH OUR PROCESS FOR HOW WE WILL CREATE AN EQUITABLE AND FAIR WAY FOR PEOPLE TO APPLY FOR THESE COMMITS. SO I MOVE THAT WE SET A LIMIT OF 36, INCREASING THE PROVISIONING FACILITIES AND LOWERING THE NO MAXIMUM TO 36 FOR EACH OF THOSE GROUPS.
02:41:21.564: >> Mayor Taylor: SECONDED BY? COUNCILMEMBER LUMM. DISCUSSION OF THAT AMENDMENT. COUNCILMEMBER NELSON?
02:41:25.735: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I ACTUALLY HAD -- JUST HAD A BRIEF CONVERSATION WITH MR. POSTEMA. I WAS WONDERING IF -- I -- I WAS WONDERING IF AHEAD OF OUR WORK SESSION WE COULD SUBMIT WRITTEN QUESTIONS THAT COULD BE PART OF THE PUBLIC RECORD, THE AGENDA, THE MINUTES IN THE SAME WAY THAT WRITTEN QUESTIONS ARE PART OF THE COUNCIL MINUTES. AND I MENTION THAT BECAUSE YOUR AMENDMENT, COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER IS -- THE QUESTION I WANTED TO ASK. IN READING THIS ORDINANCE, I WAS SORT OF STUNNED, LIKE, WE HAVE IN VERY SPECIFIC LIMIT IN ONE CATEGORY AND THEN IT'S WIDE OPEN IN ALL THE OTHER CATEGORIES. SO I GUESS SINCE IT'S ON THE TABLE RIGHT NOW, I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT HOW DID WE COME TO THAT DECISION TO NOT HAVE ANY LIMITS FOR ALL OF THESE OTHER CATEGORIES? LIKE, HOW DID WE LAND AT NO LIMITS?
02:42:16.519: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. McDONALD?
02:42:18.654: >> THE -- AND ALSO AS SENIOR ASSISTANT ATTORNEY, KRISTEN LARKMAN, IF SHE WANTS TO ADDRESS THESE, BUT THE CURRENT PERMITTING ORDINANCE THAT YOU SEE IN FRONT OF YOU, SIMPLY REFLECTS THE PREVIOUS ORDINANCE FOR MEDICAL MARIJUANA FACILITIES THAT CITY COUNCIL PASSED. SO AT THAT TIME, OR MAYBE SUBSEQUENT TO THAT TIME, A 28 -- IT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY ADDED A 28 PROVISIONING CENTER LIMIT. AND THE WAY THE ZONING ORDINANCE IS HANDLING MOST OF THESE USES IS THEY ARE KIND OF EQUIVALENT. MEANINGA MEDICAL MARIJUANA GROWER AND A -- AND A RETAIL -- OR EXCUSE ME, AN ADULT USE GROWER, ARE BEING HANDLED IN THE SAME WAY. IT'S THE SAME EQUIVALENTS FOR GROWERS, PROCESSORS AND THE OTHER USES. THE ONLY THING THAT'S NEW. THE ONLY NEW USE UNDER -- UNDER THE PERMIT REQUIREMENTS ARE DESIGNATED CONSUMPTION ESTABLISHMENTS SOME PLACE WHERE YOU CAN ACTUALLY CONSUME THE PRODUCT AS THAT'S A NEW USE. BUT COUNCIL MADE THE DECISION, AT LEAST WITH MEDICAL MARIJUANA FACILITIES THAT THERE WOULD NOT BE LIMITED. WHAT YOU HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU IS A -- IS A PERMITTING ORDINANCE THAT REALLY MATCHES WHAT YOU DID -- WHAT COUNCIL DID BEFORE FOR MEDICAL MARIJUANA.
02:43:40.603: >> Councilmember Nelson: THANK YOU. I MEAN, I GUESS TO COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER'S POINT, IT -- IT STRIKES ME THAT THERE'S A HUGE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE MARKET AVAILABLE WHEN YOU HAVE TO HAVE A WELCOME CARD FOR IT AND WHAT YOU HAVE TO BE JUST OVER 21. YEAH. WITH THE IDEA IN MIND THAT WE CAN CERTAINLY TWEAK THIS LATER, IT SEEMS LOGICAL TO ME TO LIMIT -- TO PUT SOME NUMBER ON THESE PERMITS, JUST WITH THE IDEA THAT, OF COURSE, THE DEMAND IS THAT MUCH HIGHER.
02:44:13.903: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
02:44:14.937: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. AND THIS IS TO THE AMENDMENT. AND I APPRECIATE THE SPIRIT OF THE CONVERSATION, WHERE WE DON'T WANT THE WILD, WILD WEST HERE. AND NO MAXIMUMS ON SOME OF THESE CATEGORIES, IN FACT, LIMITS ON ALL OF THEM AS PRESENTED BY THIS AMENDMENT. I WILL NOT SUPPORT THAT AMENDMENT EVEN THOUGH I APPRECIATE THE SPIRIT THAT IT'S UNDER. THESE THINGS ARE NOT ALL CONNECTED. IT SEEMS LIKE IF YOU ARE A GROWER, THEN YOU ARE THIS, THEN YOU ARE THAT, AND THESE ARE ALL DIFFERENT SUBCATEGORIES OF THE INDUSTRY AND YOU WOULDN'T -- MAYBE YOU WANT MORE SAFETY COMPLIANCE FACILITIES THAN YOU HAVE OR SOME OTHER THINGS OR YOU NEED FEWER GROWERS OR MORE PROCESSORS. THE STRAIGHT ACROSS THREE DOZEN, UNDER ALL OF THESE CATEGORIES, I THINK, IS TOO INHIBITIVE, I CAN'T SUPPORT IT. I DO SUPPORT THE SPEAR TATE IT'S BEING PUT FORTH UNDER.
02:45:24.139: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND?
02:45:26.208: >> Councilmember Grand: I SHARE SOME OF THE SAME CONCERNS. IT SEEMS SOMEWHAT RANDOM TO PUT THE SAME NUMBER OF PERMITS ON OTHER TYPES OF  FACILITIES WHERE WE NEVER HAD THEM BEFORE AND THIS UNDERCURRENT, I THINK OF OUR EXPERIENCE, THAT I DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE IS THAT WELL, 78% OF RESIDENTS WERE SUPPORTIVE OF, YOU KNOW -- OF THE NEW STATE LAW, AT THE SAME TIME, WHEN WE HAVE HAD FACILITIES INTRODUCED TO OUR NEIGHBORHOODS, MANY OF US HAVE ALSO HEARD OBJECTIONS TO THOSE. IT MAY BE FEAR BASED AND IT MAY NOT BE GROUNDED IN THE REALITY OF WHAT THAT PRACTICE LOOKS LIKE, BUT THAT'S TRUE. SO I CERTAINLY WOULD NOT LIKE TO SEE, YOU KNOW, A LIMIT PLACED ON FACILITIES THAT WE HAVE NEVER LIMITED BEFORE. I WOULD BE OPEN, I THINK, IN THE -- IN THE SPIRIT OF NOT KNOWING ANYTHING AND I THINK IT MIGHT ALLAY SOME FEARS IN THE COMMUNITY, PERHAPS, AS OPPOSED TO AN OPT OUT, HAVING SOME SORT OF LIMIT ON THE NUMBER OF CONSUMPTION ESTABLISHMENT PERMITS. I'M CERTAINLY OPEN TO THAT IDEA, BUT I -- I WOULD LIKE IT TO PERHAPS COME WITH SOME ADVICE FROM STAFF, BECAUSE THIS -- I GET WHERE COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER HAS. WE HAVE A LITTLE MORE THAN WHAT WE HAVE, AND THAT SEEMS LIKE THE RIGHT NUMBER BUT N FOR EVERYTHI.
02:46:56.565: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER SMITH.
02:46:57.399: >> Councilmember Smith: I APPRECIATE WHAT COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER IS TRYING TO DO. MR. LENART, IF YOU COULD ANSWER A QUICK QUESTION FOR ME. BASICALLY, OUR DISCUSSION AS WE WERE ADOPTING SOME OF THIS STUFF WHEN WE WERE DOING MEDICAL MARIJUANA, HOW MUCH INTEREST IS THERE IN ANYTHING OTHER THAN A PROVISIONING CENTER? YOU KNOW, DO YOU HAVE AN IDEA OF -- AND I KNOW THIS IS OFF THE TOP OF YOUR HEAD SO YOU PROBABLY DON'T HAVE THE NUMBERS, BUT DO WE HAVE ANYWHERE CLOSE TO 36 GROWERS OR PROCESSORS OR SECURED TRANSPORTERS IN THE CITY?
02:47:29.465: >> NO. IF I WOULD -- AGAIN, I WOULD HAVE TO RESEARCH IT, BUT I WOULD BE SURPRISED IF WE HAVE MORE THAN 40 FACILITIES TOTAL AMONGST ALL CATEGORIES.
02:47:40.376: >> Councilmember Smith: OKAY. THANK YOU. YOU KNOW, SO FOR MY TAKE ON, IT YOU KNOW, I WOULDN'T NECESSARILY WANT TO CAP AS THE AMENDMENT BECAUS THE CONSUMPTION, I., THINK THAT MAKES SENSE TO MIMIC WHAT WE ALREADY HAVE IN PLACE, WHETHER IT'S 28, WHETHER WE INCREASE TO 30. I THINK THAT'S A REASONABLE STARTING POINT FOR THAT DISCUSSION AND I COULD SUPPORT MAKING AN AMENDMENT TO THIS MOTION TO DO SUCH. [ OFF MICROPHONE COMMENTS ]
02:48:53.582: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WILL SPEAK TO THE AMENDMENT.
02:48:56.285: >> Councilmember Smith: GROW EGG PERMITS. [ OFF MICROPHONE COMMENTS ] AND THEN ADJUSTING D, F, AND G, TO 28.
02:49:15.137: >> Mayor Taylor: SO THAT'S THE PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO THE AMENDMENT. IS THERE A SECOND TO THAT? SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM. DOES EVERYONE UNDERSTAND THAT? ESSENTIALLY -- I THINK WHAT THAT DOES IS --
02:49:23.912: >> Councilmember Hayner: WHAT'S THAT?
02:49:25.848: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER? I'M ASSUMING THAT'S NOT A FRIENDLY AMENDMENT.
02:49:36.859: >> Councilmember Hayner:  WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO THIS. IT'S RECREATIONAL VERSUS MEDICAL.
02:49:45.133: >> Mayor Taylor: I'M ASSUMING THAT'S NOT FRIENDLY.
02:49:47.703: >> Councilmember Hayner: WELL, NOT TO ME.
02:49:52.040: >> Councilmember Smith: IT WAS NOT PRESENTED WITH MALICE.
02:49:55.377: >> Mayor Taylor: WAS THERE A SECOND? I'M SORRY, COUNCILMEMBER LUMM. COUNCILMEMBER SMITH, YOU STILL HAVE THE FLOOR ON THAT.
02:50:03.652: >> Mayor Taylor: AM I CORRECT, MR. McDONALD THAT THAT FUNCTIONALLY -- THAT THAT'S THE CURRENT STATE OF THE LAUGH RIGHT NOW -- OF THE LAW RIGHT NOW THAT THE AMENDMENT AS AMENDED WOULD BE A REVERSION TO THE CURRENT STATE OF THE LAW?
02:50:21.303: >> WE -- THE ONLY LIMIT THAT WE HAVE NOW IS FOR MEDICAL MARIJUANA PROVISIONING CENTERS AND THAT NUMBER HAS BEEN SET AT 28.
02:50:29.678: >> Mayor Taylor: YES. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU. FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE AMENDMENT TO THE AMENDMENT. LET'S TRY TO MAKE THIS PRETTY QUICK, HMM? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, YOU GO.
02:50:42.658: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU. THE REASON I -- AND I APPRECIATE TRYING TO SET IT WITH WHAT WE HAVE GOING ALREADY BUT THE REASON THAT IT'S -- I DON'T CONSIDER IT FRIENDLY IS BECAUSE GROWING AND PROCESSING, WE HAVE RECEIVED COMPLAINTS FROM GROWING OPERATIONS FROM PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT LOTS OF CITIES THAT ARE OPTING OUT THAT DON'T WANT TO EMBRACE PROP 1, AND THAT MEANS THAT BUSINESSES THAT DO ARE GOING TO FLOW TO THE CITIES THAT ALLOW IT. AND THAT'S GOING TO BE ANN ARBOR AND ANN ARBOR IS GOING TO BE MARIJUANA CENTRAL IF WE PASS ALL OF THIS STUFF, FOR THIS PART OF MICHIGAN. AND, YOU KNOW, THAT'S OKAY FOR SOME FOLKS. BUT THAT'S WHY I SET LIMITS ON IT, GROWING, WE GET COMPLAINTS FROM NEIGHBORS, ODORS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. IT'S AN EXPENSIVE PROCESS AND I JUST -- THAT'S WHY I SENT THEM TO ALL OF THEM, BECAUSE I THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK OUTSIDE OF OUR COMMUNITY HERE, OUTSIDE OF OUR MEDICAL MARIJUANA COMMUNITY THAT HAS BEEN WORKING HERE IN NASH FOR ALL OF THESE YEARS AND LOOK TO OTHER MONEY FLOWING IN LIKE IN THE SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE IN THE FIRST WARD WHERE A COUPLE OF PLACES THAT WE HAD A PRESCHOOL, A BELOVED BAGEL SHOP, THEY ARE EMPTY NOW AND PEOPLE ARE SITTING ON THEM IN ANTICIPATION OF THESE ORDINANCES. THE BAGEL FRAGEL IS A TOLEDO COMPANY. THERE'S MONEY THAT WILL BE FLOWING IN FROM ALL OVER THE PLACE, UNLESS WE WANT TO TAKE THE LID OFF AND TURN INTO MARIJUANA CENTRAL.
02:52:22.624: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
02:52:25.761: >> Councilmember Lumm: I APPRECIATE BOTH, WHERE COUNCILMEMBER SMITH AND HAYNER ARE COMING FROM ON THIS. AND THIS IS EXACTLY THE KIND OF CONVERSATION WE NEED TO HAVE. AND THANK YOU FOR. I COULD SUPPORT EITHER PROPOSAL THAT YOU ARE NOW PRESENTING US. AND SIMILARLY, I'M NOW COMBING THROUGH THE ORDINANCE TO ADDRESS THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE. THERE'S A REFERENCE MADE TO THE WILD WEST, WHEN WE LAST DISCUSSED THE MEDICAL MARIJUANA AMENDMENTS, THE AMENDMENTS THAT I WAS PROPOSING WERE LIFTED FROM THE L.A. ORDINANCE. NOW, L.A. IS NOT EXACTLY A CONSERVATIVE BASTIEN, BUT THEY HAVE BEEN STEADILY AMENDING THEIR ORDINANCES TO ADDRESS THE PROLIFERATION, FRANKLY, OF THESE VARIOUS FACILITIES. AND -- AND SO THE AMEND WERE REASONABLE AND SOUND AND HAVE EVOLVED INTO SOME BEST PRACTICE KIND OF APPROACH. AND SO I THINK WHAT'S BEING ADVOCATES HERE BY BOTH COUNCILMEMBER SMITH AND HAINEER ARE TO, YOU KNOW, AIM US IN THAT DIRECTION, THANK YOU.
02:53:58.720: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE AMENDMENT TO THE AMENDMENT. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
02:54:04.159: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY AGAIN. I WOULD, YOU KNOW, JUST SAY THAT I THINK WHAT COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER IS SAYING IS TRUE THAT THERE WILL BE AN INFLUX OF OTHERS LOOKING AT ANN ARBOR BECAUSE OF THE LIMITATIONS IN OTHER COMMUNITIES. SO, PERHAPS, 28 WON'T BE ENOUGH FOR ANN ARBOR. AND I WOULD SUGGEST, YOU KNOW, 36 IS MORE REASONABLE. BUT IN CERTAIN INSTANCES LIKE GROWERS, FRANKLY, YOU ARE PROBABLY NOT GOING TO DO THAT IN ANN ARBOR WITH THE LAND PRICES WHAT THEY ARE AT. SO THERE ARE SOME -- A LOT OF QUESTIONS. A LOT OF CONCERNS. WE'LL HASH THEM ALL OUT NEXT MONDAY, BUT, YOU KNOW, I'M JUST GOING TO LEAVE IT AT THAT, I THINK THIS' A LOT OF CONCERNS THAT I THINK AFTER A WHILE, THEY WILL BE FOUND TO BE NOT TRUE CONCERNS IN THE END. SO --

02:55:53.134: >> Mayor Taylor: THIS IS TO THE AMENDED AMENDMENT. WHAT HAPPENED. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER'S AMEND CHAPTER WAS SUPPLANTED BY COUNCILMEMBER SMITH'S AMENDMENT. COUNCILMEMBER SMITH'S AMENDMENT, WHILE BEING VOTED UP AND OVER ON TO COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER'S AMEND CHAPTER HAS NOT BEEN ADOPTED WITH RESPECT TO THE MAIN MOTION.
02:56:13.154: >> Councilmember Lumm: SO WE ARE VOTING ON THAT AMENDMENT?
02:56:15.757: >> Mayor Taylor: WE ARE DISCUSSING TAG NOW. WE ARE DISCUSSING COUNCILMEMBER SMITH'S AMENDMENT, WHICH IS THE AMENDMENT TO COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER'S AMEND CHAPTER. SO WE ARE NOW ON THE PRIMARY AMENDMENT, WHICH IS --
02:56:29.537: >> Councilmember Hayner:  CAN WE GET A SUMMARY OF WHERE WE ARE, A THROUGH G?
02:56:36.044: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER SMITH?
02:56:37.812: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I DIDN'T SEE IT COME THROUGH ON MY EMAIL.
02:56:43.451: >> Councilmember Smith: OH, I STOPPED SENDING IT WHEN WE. A, 76041A, GROWER PERMITS NEW YORK CAP, B, PROCESSOR PERMITS NO GAP. AND C, TRANSPORTER NO CAP.

02:57:17.852: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I THOUGHT WE WERE AT 36 WITH THOSE.
02:57:21.656: >> Mayor Taylor: THAT WAS HAYNER'S. FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THAT? FOR MY PART, I'M SATISFIED WITH THE CONTROLS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FIRST -- WITH THE ORDINANCE AS DRAFTED. BUT I GUESS WE WILL SEE.
02:57:35.103: >> Councilmember Lumm: YOU MEAN NO CONTROLS.
02:57:37.973: >> Mayor Taylor: THEY ARE ZONING-RELATED CONTROLS. THESE ARE PERMITS. FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
02:57:50.552: >> Councilmember Hayner: WE'RE VOTING ON THE AMENDMENT NOW?
02:57:55.156: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES.
02:57:55.757: >> Councilmember Hayner:  MY MODIFIED AMENDMENT?
02:57:59.294: >> Mayor Taylor: CORRECT.
02:58:00.061: >> Councilmember Lumm: CORRECT.

02:58:22.951: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MOTION AS AMENDED. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
02:58:29.724: >> Councilmember Lumm: REQUEST TO THE CITY ATTORNEY, CAN YOU POINT ME TO WHAT SECTION OF THE OR NANCE SPEAKS TO THE S.E.U. REQUIREMENT FOR --
02:58:41.536: >> Mayor Taylor: YOU HAD TWO --
02:58:42.737: >> Councilmember Lumm: I'M ASKING A QUESTION.
02:58:44.572: >> Mayor Taylor: YOU HAVE SPOKEN TWICE ON THE MAIN MOTION.
02:58:46.875: >> Councilmember Lumm: RIGHT AND OUR RULES -- WE CAN STILL ASK QUESTIONS AND I THINK THIS IS PARTICULARLY -- THIS SHOULD BE ALLOWED OF ALL OF US BECAUSE WE --
02:58:55.283: >> Mayor Taylor: AS YOU KNOW --
02:58:59.521: >> Councilmember Lumm: WE WERE NOT ABLE TO SUBMIT ANY QUESTIONS ON THIS ITEM.
02:59:03.525: >> Councilmember Eaton: THE MAIN MOTION HAS BEEN AMENDED AND WHAT SHE HAS TO SAY IS PERMANENT TO IT AS AMENDED AND I THINK THAT'S APPROPRIATE.
02:59:11.199: >> Mayor Taylor: THE MAIN MOTION -- ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT AFTER AN AMENDMENT, THE MAIN MOTION HAS --
02:59:17.272: >> Councilmember Eaton: IT HAS AN ALTERED.
02:59:18.973: >> Councilmember Lumm: SO WE ARE BACK TO THE MAIN MOTION.
02:59:20.608: >> Mayor Taylor: THE SPEAKER COUNT RECALCULATES TO ZERO?
02:59:25.080: >> Councilmember Eaton: YES.
02:59:30.385: >> Mayor Taylor: THAT STRIKES ME AS A RULE THAT SWALLOWS THE TWO SPEAKER --
02:59:36.724: >> Councilmember Lumm: WE HAVE A COUNCIL RULE THAT ADDRESSES THE NUMBER OF TIMES SOMEONE CAN SPEAK BUT WE -- I THOUGHT WE ALL AGREED THAT COUNCILMEMBERS COULD ASK QUESTIONS OF STAFF AT COUNCIL MEETINGS. AND THE CLOCK DOESN'T TICK --
02:59:50.105: >> Mayor Taylor: AS WE -- AS YOU KNOW, WE COMMUNICATED ABOUT THIS AS A COUNCIL.
02:59:55.009: >> Councilmember Lumm: RIGHT.
02:59:55.743: >> Mayor Taylor: AND --
02:59:56.277: >> Councilmember Lumm: I AGREE.
02:59:57.979: >> Mayor Taylor: I'M HERE TO FACILITATE FOR THE GROUP. THE GROUP, AS I UNDERSTAND IT, ACCEPTED THE PROPOSITION THAT QUESTIONS WOULD COUNT AS SPEAKING TIMES.
03:00:06.821: >> Councilmember Lumm: NO, ABSOLUTELY NOT!
03:00:09.457: >> Councilmember Eaton: I CERTAINLY DON'T ACCEPT THAT. THAT'S NOT BEEN OUR PRACTICE IN THE PAST.
03:00:13.094: >> Mayor Taylor: OF COURSE IT HAS NOT BEEN THE PRACTICE IN PAST BUT THE MOST RECENT COMMUNICATION.
03:00:19.167: >> Councilmember Lumm: IT WAS NOT. I WILL RESEND YOU THAT EMAIL EXCHANGE RIGHT NOW.
03:00:22.770: >> Mayor Taylor: I'M ASKING THE BODY HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT THIS.
03:00:26.107: >> LATIMER SPEAK.
03:00:28.643: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
03:00:29.711: >> Councilmember Lumm: I COULD MOVE FOR A SHORT BREAK AND I WILL SEND YOU THE EMAIL EXCHANGE WE ALL HAD ABOUT THIS TO --
03:00:37.719: >> Mayor Taylor: I KNOW WHAT WAS WRITTEN.
03:00:39.454: >> Councilmember Lumm: I DO AS WELL, AND YOUR RECALL AND MINE ARE 180 DEGREES DIFFERENT, APPARENTLY.
03:00:46.694: >> Mayor Taylor: NO SHAME IN IT.
03:00:49.597: >> Councilmember Lumm: WE HAVE NEVER -- I ALWAYS SUBMIT MY QUESTIONS IN ADVANCE. AND EVERYBODY TRIES TO DO EXACTLY THAT, AND -- BUT ON THIS ITEM, THERE WAS NO PROVIDED FOR THAT.
03:01:05.346: >> Mayor Taylor: I UNDERSTAND THAT.
03:01:07.649: >> Councilmember Lumm: WHETHER OR NOT SOMEONE SUBMITS QUESTIONS THEY SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO ASK STAFF --
03:01:11.886: >> Councilmember Grand: POINT OF THE ORDER. IS THERE A --
03:01:16.124: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
03:01:18.026: >> Councilmember Grand: THERE'S BEEN TIME ALLOTTED TO ASK THE QUESTION. PLEASE ASK THE QUESTION.
03:01:22.497: >> Councilmember Lumm: THIS STARTED BECAUSE --
03:01:24.098: >> Mayor Taylor: YOUR TIME IS ALLOTTED. LOO E Z.PLEASE ASK THE QUESTIONU
03:01:29.671: >> Councilmember Lumm: MR. McD ONALD, COULD YOU POINT ME TO WHERE IN THE OR ORDINANCE IT SPS TO THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE REQUIREMENT FOR CONSUMPTION TO -- THE CONSUMPTION FACILITY DESIGNATION AND NOT MICROBUSINESSES?
03:01:48.990: >> I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY A MORE PROPER QUESTION FOR BRETT LENART. WE ARE STILL ON C-1, AND C-1.
03:01:59.601: >> Councilmember Lumm: SORRY, GOT. IT THANKS.
03:02:01.436: >> C-1 IS MERITING AND I THINK THE U.D.C. CHANGES ON C-2.
03:02:04.739: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I HAVE A QUESTION.
03:02:07.842: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
03:02:08.743: >> Councilmember Hayner:  CAN YOU POINT ME TO WHERE THE FEE SCHEDULE IS? IS THE FEE SCHEDULE INCLUDED WITH THIS? IS THERE A FEE SCHEDULED ASSOCIATED WITH THREE VARIOUS PERMITS.
03:02:23.057: >> I THINK IT'S $5,000 AS LISTED IN THE ORDINANCE.
03:02:28.663: >> Councilmember Hayner: EACH, A THROUGH J? [ OFF MICROPHONE COMMENTS ]
03:02:40.174: >> Councilmember Hayner:  WHEN IS THAT? NOW? I MEAN, I BELIEVE THAT A FEE SCHEDULE SHOULD BE INCLUDED AS PART OF THIS ORDINANCE, SHOULD IT NOT?
03:03:12.607: >> Councilmember Hayner: WHILE THEY ARE DELIBERATING, IF I MAY, I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THIS NOVEMB NOVEMBER 1st DEADLINE IS ARBITRARILY IMPOSED AND MAYBE NOT ARBITRARILY, BUT IT'S A SELF-IMPOSED DEADLINE IF WE WANT TO OPEN UP THE GATES TO MARIJUANA COMMERCE IN THIS CITY OUTSIDE OF THE EXISTING MEDICAL RULES, AND SO I DON'T FEEL THE PANIC THAT SOME AT THIS TABLE DO FOR WHATEVER REASON. YOU KNOW, WE'RE NOT PUTTING ANYBODY OUT OF THE MEDICAL BUSINESS BY FAILING TO ACT IN A TIMELY MANNER.
03:03:51.646: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
03:03:52.547: >> Councilmember Bannister:  I ACTUALLY DO HAVE A RESPONSE ON THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE. I THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE A RETAILER IN A PLACE OF SOCIAL USE ESTABLISHMENT FOR PEOPLE TO CONSUME IN BECAUSE OTHERWISE THEY ARE POTENTIALLY IN VIOLATION OF THE -- THEIR LANDLORD -- YOU KNOW, IF THEIR LANDLORD DOESN'T ALLOW THEM TO SPOKE OR THEY ARE FROM STAYING AT A LOCAL HOTEL, THEY NEED TO HAVE A PLACE TO CONSUME THEIR PURCHASE. AND SO THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE DON'T WANT TO -- IT'S DISCRIMINATORY AGAINST NON-HOMEOWNERS IF WE DON'T MOVE FORWARD ON IT.
03:04:36.424: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN MOTION AS AMENDED? MR. McDONALD?
03:05:01.949: >> I WANTED TO RESPOND TO COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER'S EARLIER QUESTION, AND I APOLOGIZE FOR THE DELAY. IN -- IN THIS SECTION OF THE CODE, 7:603, IT'S IN SUB -- I'M SORRY. I MEAN, 7:606 IN SECTION H OR I, AND THE REVISED CODE. THERE'S A SECTION THAT DOES ADDRESS THAT THE PAYMENT OF THE APPLICATION FEE AND THAT PAYMENT APPLICATION FEE WILL BE DETERMINED BY COUNCIL RESOLUTION.
03:05:41.923: >> Councilmember Hayner:  SO MY CONCERN WITH NOT HAVING IT ASSOCIATED WITH THIS IS THAT IF WE DON'T HAVE IT IN PLACE WHEN THESE RULES TAKE EFFECT, THEN THE CITY IS LOSING AN OPPORTUNITY TO KNOW WHAT THOSE FEES ARE -- ESTABLISH THOSE FEES AND COLLECT THOSE FEES.
03:05:57.438: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. McDONALD?
03:05:58.105: >> MY ANSWER TO THAT IS THAT THAT -- SO THERE WILL BE A RESOLUTION WHICH WILL COME AT A SUBSEQUENT TIME BEFORE NOVEMBER 1st, WITH THOSE FEES IN PLACE.
03:06:11.986: >> Councilmember Hayner:  THAT WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY FOR ME TO SUPPORT THIS WHOLE PROCESS MOVING FORWARD, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW THE KICKBACK THAT WE GET FROM THE STATE, THE TAX REVENUE, THAT SHARED BACK WITH THE LOCAL COMMUNITY IS A PITTANCE COMPARED TO THE TAX REVENUE THAT THE STATE GETS FOR THEIR PURPOSES AND I THINK IT'S FOR EVERY -- THE WAY IT BREAKS DOWN, IT'S FOR EVERY MILLION DOLLARS SOLD INSIDE THE CITY LIMITS WE GET 15,000. AND SO I THINK THE PERMITTING FEES ARE -- ARE REASONABLE TO EXPECT THAT WE ESTABLISH THEM IN A TIMELY MANNER. THAT'S ALL. I DIDN'T SEE THEM IN HERE AND SO --
03:06:45.052: >> Mayor Taylor: MY UNDERSTANDING, WE WILL SEE THEM BEFORE -- WE'LL SEE THEM NEXT ONE.
03:06:49.924: >> YES, IF YOU ARE PASSING AN ORDINANCE THAT ENABLES FEES, THEN YOU REALLY HAVE TO PASS THE ORDINANCE, AT LEAST AT THE SAME TIME YOU ARE PUTTING THE FEE SCHEDULE IN PLACE.
03:06:59.901: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN MOTION? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
03:07:08.676: >> Councilmember Hayner:  NO.
03:07:15.683: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES.
03:07:18.853: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES.
03:07:22.857: >> Councilmember Lumm: NO.
03:07:24.392: >> Councilmember Grand: YES.
03:07:24.992: >> Clerk Beaudry: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN ABSENT.
03:07:27.628: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
03:07:28.129: >> Councilmember Eaton: YES.
03:07:28.729: >> Councilmember Nelson:  YES.
03:07:30.565: >> Councilmember Smith: YES.
03:07:31.165: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: AFFIRMATIVE.
03:07:32.967: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION CARRIES.
03:07:35.503: >> Mayor Taylor: C-2, ORDINANCE TO AMEND SECTIONS 1.15, 5.16.3, 5.19.2, AND 5.37.2 OF THE CHAPTER AMEND CHAPTER UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT COAT OF TITLE V. CODE OF CITY OF ANN ARBOR MARIJUANA RETAILERS MARIJUANA MICROBUSINESSES, MOVED AND SECONDED. COUNCILMEMBER SMITH.
03:07:59.327: >> Councilmember Smith: SO IT'S BEEN POINTED OUT TO ME BY MR. McDONALD THAT I NEED TO MOVE HIS -- THE AMENDMENTS SUGGESTED BY THE ATTORNEY'S OFFICE THAT ARE INCLUDED IN LEGISTAR AS THE REVISED MARIJUANA ZONING ORDINANCE COUNCIL.PDF FORWARD FOR CONSIDERATION. IS THAT CORRECT, MR. McDONALD?
03:08:24.785: >> YES, THAT IS CORRECT.
03:08:28.322: >> Councilmember Eaton: I SECOND THAT.
03:08:33.160: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER SMITH, YOU STILL HAVE THE FLOOR.
03:08:39.800: >> Councilmember Smith: SO THAT IS THE LANGUAGE PUT FORTH BY THE ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. I HAVE ADDITIONAL LANGUAGE THAT I WOULD LIKE TO ADD TO THAT, BUT I THINK WE NEED TO VOTE ON THIS AMENDMENT FIRST, AS IT WOULD BE AN ADDITIONAL AMENDMENT THAT I'M OFFERING OR I SUPPOSE WE COULD ROLL IT ALL INTO ONE.
03:08:58.052: >> Mayor Taylor: LET'S TAKE ONE EACH AT A TIME. HAS THAT BEEN CIRCULATED?
03:09:03.524: >> Councilmember Smith: IT'S ON LEGISTAR.
03:09:08.129: >> Mayor Taylor: OKAY. IS IT FRIENDLY TO THE BODY?
03:09:15.136: >> YES.
03:09:15.603: >> Mayor Taylor: I MISHEARD. IS IT FRIENDLY TO THE BODY.
03:09:18.839: >> Councilmember Smith: YES.
03:09:19.573: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. COUNCILMEMBER SMITH, YOU STILL HAVE THE BALL.
03:09:23.177: >> Councilmember Smith: SINCE IT IS FRIENDLY TO THE BODY, CLERK BEAUDRY, COULD YOU DISTRIBUTE THE ADDITIONAL AMENDMENT THAT I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE? AND WHAT THIS DOES IS ESTABLISHES THE ABILITY FOR THE COLLOCATION OF ASSUMPTION CONSUMPTION T FACILITIES WITH PROVISIONING CENTERS, RETAIL CENTERS IN THE D1 AND D2 DISTRICTS.
03:09:58.979: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE A SECOND. SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI. COUNCILMEMBER SMITH, YOU STILL HAVE THE FLOOR.
03:10:04.952: >> Councilmember Smith: I'M HAPPY TO ENTERTAIN DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THIS, BUT MY THINKING ON THIS IS THAT WITHIN THE D-1, D-2 DISTRICT, THERE'S A BIT OF SELF-REGULATION THAT HAPPENS BASED ON OUR SEPARATION DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS AND I THINK THAT TO INTRODUCE THIS NEW USE, IT'S APPROPRIATE TO HAVE IT IN THE SPOT WHERE MOST PEOPLE ARE. SO I WILL JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT AND CEDE THE FLOOR FOR DISCUSSION.
03:10:42.223: >> Mayaylor: IS THAT FRIENDLY TO THE BODY? IS THAT A NO?
03:10:44.725: >> Councilmember Bannister:  I HAVE A CONCERN ABOUT THE D-1, D-2 REGION.
03:10:49.130: >> Councilmember Smith: OKAY. WHICH IS?
03:10:55.503: >> Councilmember Bannister: WE KNOW OF OTHER DISPENSARIES FURTHER OUT ALONG PACKARD AND ALONG NORTH MAIN THAT WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE CO-CONSUMPTION AND RETAIL AND THEY AREN'T IN D-1 OR D-2.
03:11:14.255: >> Councilmember Smith: I'M HAPPY TO ENTERTAIN AMENDMENTS TO THIS.
03:11:22.630: >> Councilmember Hayner:  CAN I ASK A QUESTION ABOUT THE TABLE BEFORE US?
03:11:26.100: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
03:11:27.201: >> Councilmember Hayner:  SO AS PART OF THE MODIFIED PDF THAT WAS CHAIRED WITH US EARLIER. SO THIS IS A -- THIS PERMITTED USES TABLE ON PAGE 3 OF 66, AM I READING THAT CORRECTLY IF THERE'S A P, IT'S A PERMITTED USE THAT THINGS WE'RE DISCUSSING HERE --
03:11:48.856: >> Councilmember Lumm: MM-HMM.
03:11:49.490: >> Councilmember Hayner:  ARE PERMITTED IN THESE AREAS. SO SINGLE FAMILY DWELLING, R1A SAYS PERMITTED. JUST EXACTLY WHAT IS THAT, THAT'S PERMITTED? ANY OF THESE? ANY OF THESE USES ARE PERMITTED? OR WE'RE JUST TALKING ABOUT MARIJUANA RETAILERS, MICROBUSINESSES AND CONSUMPTION FACILITIES?
03:12:14.481: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. LENART.
03:12:15.082: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I HOPE I'M READING THIS LONG.
03:12:17.384: >> THE PERMITTED USE TABLE AS IS REQUIRED BY CHARTER, WE HAVE TO PRESENT TO YOU THE FULL SECTION OF THE ORDINANCE THAT WE WERE PROPOSED TO AMENDING. SO THIS DEMONSTRATES ALL OF THE USES THAT ARE LISTED IN THE CITY'S UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE AND ALL THE DISTRICTS. WHAT YOU WILL SEE IS WHETHER THERE'S UNDERLYING NOTATIONS, THOSE ARE THE CHANGES TO THE USE DESCRIPTION OR THE CATEGORIES AND LOCATIONS THAT IS DISTRICTS IN WHICH WE ARE PROPOSE THOSE TO BE EITHER A PERMITTED USE. THE MAJORITY, WHEN YOU LOOK AT R1A, WE ARE NOT PROPOSING ANY CHANGES AS PART OF THIS ORDINANCE AMENDMENT.
03:12:56.056: >> Councilmember Hayner:  SO IT'S ONLY WHAT HAS BEEN ADDED IN HERE. SO IT'S SPECIAL EXCEPTION AND C1A THROUGH C3. AND MARIJUANA RETAILER, AGAIN, IT'S SPECIAL EXCEPTION C1 THROUGH C3, ALONG WITH THE -- BUT NOW THAT'S BEEN MODIFIED, RIGHT, M1 THROUGH M2, THAT'S BEEN MODIFIED AND SO THAT TABLE IS NOT ACCURATE IN FRONT OF ME? I HAVE TO GO TO THE OTHER ONE?
03:13:24.685: >> NO, THAT TABLE IS ACCURATE.
03:13:26.086: >> Councilmember Hayner:  AND COUNCILMEMBER SMITH, THAT HAS YOUR CHANGES IN IT, THE TABLE I SEE BEFORE YOU IN THIS PDF?
03:13:31.292: >> NO.
03:13:32.860: >> Councilmember Hayner: OKAY.
03:13:35.496: >> NO THE -- SO WHAT -- I THINK IF I'M UNDERSTANDING CORRECTLY, THE PROPOSED CHANGE, IF YOU LOOK IN THE PERMITTED USE TABLE UNDER --
03:13:44.305: >> Councilmember Lumm: WHAT PAGE ARE YOU ON?
03:13:45.906: >> UNDER SALES WHICH IS THE FOURTH -- FIFTH PAGE OF THE PERMITS USE TABLE.
03:13:51.845: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YOU MEAN MARIJUANA RETAIL OR DESIGNATED CONSUMPTION FACILITY?
03:13:57.318: >> Councilmember Lumm: WHAT PAGE OF THE PERMITTED USE TABLE?
03:14:05.059: >> I'M SORRY, I HAVE A HARD COPY.
03:14:08.095: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I THINK IT'S PAGE 7 OR 6.
03:14:13.200: >> IT SAYS SALES, THE FIRST ONE IS AUTOMOBILES, MOTORCYCLES RECREATIONAL VEHICLES. SO WHAT THIS PROPOSED AMENDMENT IS DOING IN THIS CASE IS ADDING A NEW USE, DESIGNATED MARIJUANA CONSUMPTION FACILITY. IT'S IDENTIFYING IT AS A SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE IN THE C1A THROUGH C3 DISTRICT. HOWEVER, I THINK THE PROPOSED DISCUSSION IS THAT BLANKET OVERALL, WE RESTRICT WITH FEW CIRCUMSTANCES ONLY THAT -- THAT YOU CAN ONLY HAVE ONE MARIJUANA FACILITY TYPE ON A LOT, AND SO WHAT THE PROPOSED AMENDMENT WOULD DO IS NOT CHANGE THE USE LOCATIONS OF WHERE THOSE COULD BE BUT RATHER SAY IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE, COULD YOU HAVE BOTH A DESIGNATED CONSUMPTION FACILITY AND A PROVISIONING CENTER OR A RETAILER ON THE SAME LOT. SO IT'S NOT -- IF UNDERSTANDING CORRECTLY, THE AMENDMENT IS NOT CHANGE WHERE THOSE USES ARE BEING PROPOSED IN THE LANGUAGE THAT'S BEEN PROPER BUT RATHER TO SAY YOU COULD STACK THAT USE ON TOP OF OTHER USES. AND THAT WOULD BE PERMISSIBLE.
03:15:22.536: >> Councilmember Hayner:  WHY ARE WE KEEPING IT OUT OF OFFICE WHEN OFFICE HAS SO MANY OTHER OUTDOWNSTREAM USES. THERE ARE SOME GREAT AREAS OF THE CITY ZONED TO OFFICE.
03:15:32.613: >> THE THOUGHT AT THE PLANNING COMMISSION AND STAFF DISCUSSION IS DESIGNATED CONSUMPTION FACILITY IS VERY MUCH A TRANSACTIONAL RETAIL-TYPE USE. IT'S EQUIVALENT TO PERHAPS LIKE A RESTAURANT OR A COFFEE SHOP. AND SO THE TYPE OF DISTRICTS THAT WE WOULD WANT TO ENCOURAGE THE INTERACTION WITH THE PUBLIC ARE MORE RETAIL ORIENTED, VERSUS OFFICE MIGHT BE MORE OF A BLEND OF USES THAT MIGHT HAVE YOU GOING TO WORK AT YOUR ACCOUNTANT SHOP AND STAYING THERE FOR AGENDA HOURS AND SO THE NATURE OF THAT DESIGNATED CONSUMPTION FACILITY IS SERVICE OR RETAIL AND SO THE THOUGHT WAS TO KEEP IT IN THE COMMERCIAL AND DOWNTOWN DISTRICT.
03:16:09.349: >> Councilmember Hayner: SURE. I WILL JUST POINT OUT THAT LAST WEEK WE UPZONED -- NOT UPZONED BUT CHANGED THE ZONING TABLES TO ALLOW RESTAURANTS IN OFFICE. AND SO I'M NOT SURE THAT'S THE BEST ANALOGY. BUT I JUST WONDERED WHY. LIKE, WE LET RESTAURANTS IN THERE OR COFFEE SHOPS ALL OF A SUDDEN IN AB O AN OFFICE, BUT MA MARIJUANA CONSUMPTION FACILITY.
03:16:42.816: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF COUNCILMEMBER
03:16:45.986: >> Councilmember Lumm: MR. LENAR T, WHAT WOULD THIS DO -- HOW WOULD THIS AFFECT ONE WAY OR ANOTHER, THE RESTRICTION ON THE NUMBER OF FACILITIES THAT CAN BE WITHIN 600 FEET OF ONE ANOTHER?
03:17:49.816: >> I'M LOOKING FOR THE SECTION, BUT IT WAS NOT INTENDED TO CHANGE THAT PROVISION. I'M TRYING TO FIND WHERE IT'S LOCATED IN THE SUBSTITUTE VERSION.
03:18:01.828: >> Councilmember Lumm: SECTION 1 .16.
03:18:07.467: >> UNDER SECTION 5.16.3, THE TITLE, THE SECTION, NUMBER THREE ADDITIONAL FACILITY LOCATION RESTRICTIONS, IF YOU GO DOWN TO SUBC, NO LOT CONTAINING A MEDICAL MARIJUANA CONTAINING CENTER OR MIKE ROW BUSINESS OR RETAILER SHOULD BEING LOCATED WITHIN 600 FEET OF ANY LOT IN WHICH ANOTHER OF THOSE USES ARE LOCATED. SO WE HAVE NOT REMOVED THE PROVISIONING. WE HAVE ADDED MICROBUSINESS TO THAT, BUT WE HAVE NOT INCLUDED DESIGNATED CONSUMPTION FACILITY WITHIN A 600 FEET WITHIN ONE ANOTHER RESTRICTION. THERE'S NO RESTRICTION FROM THE CONSUMPTION FACILITY. THEY ARE LIKE ALL FACILITIES SUBJECT TO THE 1,000-FOOT SEPARATION FROM SCHOOLS.
03:19:05.792: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
03:19:07.294: >> Councilmember Hayner: ANOTHER QUESTION. SO WE HAVE HAD -- WE ONLY HAD A HANDFUL OF EXCEPTION USES. I ONLY HAD A HANDFUL COME BEFORE ME HERE. SO WHEN I SEE IN C1A, AND C1AR, IT'S UP FOR A SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE, AND SO THAT MEANS IT'S ALLOWED WITH THE GRACES OF COUNCIL TO BE USED IN THOSE PLACES. NO?
03:19:30.150: >> NO, SPECIAL EXCEPTION USES ARE DECISIONS MADE BY THE PLANNING COMMISSION. THEY ARE SUBJECT TO A HIGHER LEVEL OF REVIEW. THAT REVIEW GENERALLY ACROSS ALL SPECIAL EXCEPTION USES THINKS -- CONSIDERS THINGS LIKE ACCESS TO THE SITE, BOTH VEHICULAR AND NON-MOTORIZED AND THE MASTER PLAN RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THAT SITE, AND THEN WE BUILT IN ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS THAT HAVE TO BE MET ABOUT THE HANDLING OF WASTE, SECURITY PLAN AND THE LIKE. AND SO THOSE ARE EVALUATION METHODS AND START ADS BY WHICH THE PLANNING COMMISSION WOULD -- STANDARDS BY WHICH THE PLANNING COMMISSION WOULD DECIDE ON WHETHER TO GRANT A SPECIAL EXCEPTION.
03:20:25.605: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I ASK BECAUSE AS WE SEE MORE FOLKS TRYING TO USE C1AR AND C1B AND SO ON FOR ACTUAL RESIDENTIAL USES, NOT THE COMMERCIAL USES BY WHICH IT WAS INTENDED ORIGINALLY, I CAN SEE SOME CONFLICT IN THESE AREAS THAT WE DON'T HAVE ANY SAY OVER IF WE PASS THIS TABLE LIKE THIS, IT'S ALL THAT PLANNING. AND I WILL GET EMAILSMAILS FROM PEOPLE.
03:20:59.573: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
03:21:00.907: >> Councilmember Eaton: I WOULD OFFER AN AMENDMENT TO THIS. I WOULD LIKE TO STRIKE THE WORDS IN THE D-1 OR D-2 DISTRICTS FROM THE LAST SENTENCE OF PARAGRAPH E.
03:21:11.251: >> Mayor Taylor: SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER SMITH. IS THAT FRIENDLY TO THE BODY? FRIENDLY. FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE AMENDMENT AS AMENDED.
03:21:23.163: >> Councilmember Lumm: COULD SOMEONE READ THE AMENDMENT?
03:21:25.265: >> Mayor Taylor: LET ME PULL IT BACK AS BEING FRIENDLY. COUNCILMEMBER EATON, WOULD YOU PLEASE RESTATE?
03:21:30.937: >> Councilmember Lumm: NO, I HEARD WHAT HE SAID, BUT --
03:21:33.774: >> Councilmember Eaton: I CAN'T HEAR YOU. I'M SORRY.
03:21:37.778: >> Mayor Taylor: THE AMENDMENT -- THE FUNCTION OF THE AMENDMENT AS NOW MODIFIED WOULD BE TO PERMIT ON-SITE CONSUMPTION -- THE STACKING OF USES SO THAT YOU COULD BE BOTH A RETAILER AND A DESIGNATED CONSUMPTION FACILITY. IS THAT CORRECT?
03:21:57.431: >> Councilmember Eaton: AND YOU COULD BE BOTH A MEDICAL PROVISIONING CENTER AND A RECREATIONAL.
03:22:06.940: >> Mayor Taylor: YES. FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE AMENDMENT AS AMENDED? COUNCILMEMBER NELSON?
03:22:16.216: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I HAVE A QUESTION AND I'M -- I'M AFRAID I MIGHT -- IN ALL THE REVISIONS THAT HAVE BEEN SENT, I'M NOT SURE THAT I'M EVEN LOOKING AT THE RIGHT DOCUMENT, BUT --
03:22:28.495: >> Councilmember Lumm: AMEN.
03:22:29.095: >> Councilmember Nelson:  SO I HAD A QUESTION ABOUT THE PARKING. THERE WAS AN EXPLANATION ABOUT MARIJUANA CONSUMPTION FACILITY MUST PROVIDE A MAXIMUM OF ONE VEHICLE PARKING PLACE PER HUNDRED SQUARE FEET OF FLOOR AREA, AND I WAS SURPRISED BY THE USE OF THE WORD MAXIMUM, LIKE I THOUGHT THAT PARKING WAS USUALLY FRAMED IN TERMS OF MINIMUMS. SO I GUESS I WAS JUST CURIOUS FOR AN EXPLANATION OF THAT.
03:22:57.824: >> WE HAVE A VARIETY OF PARKINGG STANDARDS. THERE ARE MAN MUM STANDARDS. THEY HAVE BOTH A MINIMUM AND A MAXIMUM. SO WE SPECIFY A RANGE. AND LOOKING AT THE STANDARDS FOR DESIGNATED MARIJUANA CONSUMPTION FACILITY, THESE -- BASED ON THE INTENDED USE, THE PLANNING COMMISSION AND STAFF THOUGHT THAT IT DIDN'T -- IT'S -- IT'S MANDATING VEHICULAR PARKING FOR THESE USES WHERE PEOPLE WERE GOING TO ACTIVELY CONSUME MARIJUANA, DIDN'T SEEM LIKE A POLICY RECOMMENDATION THAT WE WANTED TO DICTATE TO SAY YOU HAVE TO DRIVE OR YOU HAVE TO PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DRIVE TO THESE FACILITIES.
03:23:41.468: >> Councilmember Nelson: WELL, CREATING PARKING SPACES IS AND NORMALLY THESE FACILITY HAVE STAFF TOO.
03:23:48.008: >> MM-HMM.
03:23:48.508: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I HEAR YOU. I MEAN THAT WAS ACTUALLY MY THOUGHT. THAT WAS THE ONLY REASONING I COULD THINK OF WHY YOU WOULD HAVE A MAXIMUM, BUT WE DON'T THINK THAT WAY ABOUT BARS DO WE? I MEAN --
03:24:00.820: >> NO, AND I THINK WE -- WE TALKED ABOUT THAT AS A SIMILAR USE FOR A LOT -- IN CONSIDERING THAT. THE DISTINCTION WAS THAT SORT OF THE EVOLUTION AND HOW THESE CONSUMPTION FACILITIES ARE GOING TO USE FROM A BUSINESS MODEL ARE A LITTLE MORE UNCLEAR. THERE'S A LOT OF RESTRICTIONS TO SERVE FOOD THERE, UNLIKE A BAR WHERE IT'S VERY COMMON THAT YOU AND YOUR FAMILY MIGHT WANT TO GO AND YOUR KIDS WILL GET A BURGER AND YOU MIGHT HAVE A BEER. THE DESIGNATED CONSUMPTION FACILITY WE DON'T HAVE THAT TRACK RECORD OF WHAT THE ANCILLARY USES ARE GOING TO BE. IS IT LIFE ENTERTAINMENT OR IS IT VIDEO GAMES? THERE ARE GOING TO SOME RESTRICTIONS ABOUT WHAT OTHER USES YOU CAN PUT THERE. AND THIS WAS PRESUMING THAT THE PRIMARY USE WAS FOR THE CONSUMPTION FOR A SUBSTANCE THAT MIGHT IMPAIR YOUR ABILITY TO DRIVE. GIVEN THAT THEY ARE GOING TO BE -- WE ARE ALSO PROPOSING THE USES IN THE DOWNTOWN DISTRICT OR THE SPECIAL DISTRICTS WHERE THEY ARE PART OF LARGER COMMERCIAL CENTERS, PLANNING COMMISSION THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE REASONABLE TO PUT A CAP ON PARKING INDICTATING A MINIMUM. OKAY THEN MY NEXT QUESTION RELATED TO THAT IS IF WE ARE ALLOWING TWO USES SIMULTANEOUS, HOW DOES THAT RELATE TO A PARKING MAXIMUM THEN?
03:25:19.666: >> WE LOOK AT THAT WHEN WE DOING THE DOANING COMPLIANCE. WE MAKE SURE IF YOU ARE PUTTING BOTH USES, YOU WILL HAVE TO SATISFY THE PARKING DEMAND FOR BOTH OF THOSE USES.
03:25:28.208: >> Councilmember Nelson:  BUT THE MAXIMUM. SO DO YOU ADD THEM UP AND THE MAXIMUM BECOMES TWO INSTEAD OF ONE?
03:25:35.682: >> SO IN THE CASE OF A PROVISIONING CENTER OR THE CONSUMPTION, THERE WILL BE RESTRICTED IN THE RULES ABOUT HOW THOSE HAVE TO BE D SEGREGAT, EVEN IF THEY ARE OCCURRING ON THE SAME LOT. THERE MIGHT BE PROVISIONING, BUT ANY SQUARE FOOTAGE THAT'S ALLOCATED TO A CONSUMPTION FACILITY WOULD NOT BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE ANY PARKING IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE. I MEAN, YOUR QUESTION IS GOOD BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A CAP ON THE PROVISIONING CENTER. IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE SORT OF INEFFECTIVE FOR THOSE JOINT USES BECAUSE YOU COULD SAY, WELL, YOU ARE JUST GOING TO PROVIDE A LOT MORE PARKING FOR THE PROVISIONING CENTER AND I'M NOT EXCEEDING ANY MAXIMUM FOR THE DESIGNATE FACILITY. IN A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE THAT'S A MORIMORE ISOLATED  I FACILITY, U DON'T HAVE TO PARK AT A CERTAIN RATE.
03:26:26.733: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I CERTAINLY DON'T THINK THAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE CONSUMING AND CLIMBING INTO A CAR, BUT THERE'S AN EXTRA PROBLEM IN THAT IF ANN ARBOR IS TAKING THE LEAD ON LICENSING THESE FACILITIES AND THEY DON'T EXIST ELSEWHERE THAT PEOPLE WILL BE DRIVING TO THEM. I DON'T KNOW HOW EASY IT ISO HAVE A DESIGNATED DRIVER IN ANY OF THESE LOCATIONS. I UNDERSTAND YOUR REASONING THANKS.
03:26:50.957: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE DID, I BELIEVE WE ARE AT THE MAIN MOTION AS AMENDED; IS THAT CORRECT? I THOUGHT THAT WAS APPROVED AS FRIENDLY. IS THAT RIGHT?
03:27:04.771: >> Councilmember Grand: WE MAY NEED TO VOTE ON IT.
03:27:11.845: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
03:27:12.746: >> Councilmember Bannister:  I WOULD LIKE TO FOLLOW ON WITH THE DISCUSSION ABOUT PARKING. WHAT ABOUT AN AMENDMENT TO JUST REMOVE THE MINIMUMS OR MAXIMUMS ON THE PARKING? AND JUST TREAT IT LIKE A REGULAR RESTAURANT, BAR, STORE, AND NOT HAVE THIS -- I THINK THIS MAXIMUM PARKING OF ONE IS JUST GOING TO BE A PROBLEM. SO I'M SUGGESTING AN AMENDMENT.
03:27:45.545: >> Mayor Taylor: I --
03:27:46.045: >> IF I COULD BE CLEAR, IT'S A MAXIMUM OF ONE SPACE PER 100 SQUARE FOOT OF FLOOR AREA. IT'S NOT A MAXIMUM OF 1 PARKING SPACE. SO IF YOU HAVE 1,000, SQUARE FOOT FACILITY, IT'S A MAXIMUM OF 10 PARKING SPACES.
03:28:01.961: >> Mayor Taylor: I THINK I MISTAKED. COUNCILMEMBER SMITH'S AMENDMENT AS AMENDED, STILL NEEDS TO BE APPROVED. IS COUNCIL MEMBER SMITH'S AMENDMENT TO PROVIDE FOR THE STACKING OF USES, IS THAT FRIENDLY TO THE BODY? I'M GOING TO SAY YES UNLESS SOMEONE TELLS ME OTHER WISE. THANK YOU. SO IT'S FRIENDLY. NOW WE ARE BACK ON THE MAIN MOTION AS AMENDED. ARE THERE ANY FURTHER -- IS THERE ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
03:28:33.793: >> Councilmember Hayner:  NO.
03:28:36.429: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES.
03:28:39.265: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES.
03:28:43.403: >> Councilmember Lumm: NO.
03:28:44.737: >> Councilmember Grand: YES.
03:28:45.338: >> Clerk Beaudry: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN, ABSENT.
03:28:49.008: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
03:28:49.576: >> Councilmember Eaton: YES.
03:28:50.176: >> Councilmember Nelson:  YES.
03:28:52.111: >> Councilmember Smith: YES.
03:28:52.712: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: ABSOLUTELY.
03:28:55.114: >> Clerk Beaudry: THE MOTION CARRIES.
03:29:00.153: >> Mayor Taylor: DC-1, RESOLUTION TO WAIVE FEES ASSOCIATED WITH FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT. REQUEST 2147. MOVED AND SECONDED BY BANNISTER. COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
03:29:11.531: >> Councilmember Eaton: THANK YOU. I HAD SOME NOTES AND I WILL TRY TO LOOK AT THEM. I HAVE NOT, SO I WILL WING IT. IT'S MY BELIEF THAT A COUNCIL PERSON PERFORMING THE DUTIES OF A COUNCILPERSON SHOULD NOT BE REQUIRED TO PAY FOR INFORMATION THAT THEY NEED TO PERFORM THAT FUNCTION. WE HAVE SEEN A NUMBER OF INFORMATION REQUESTS FROM COUNCILMEMBERS BE TREATED AS FOIA REQUESTS, WITH A COST ATTACHED TO IT. FOR EXAMPLE, LAST YEAR, I REQUESTED ALL THE POLICE REPORTS ABOUT A SINGING HOUSE IN MY WARD -- A SINGLE HOUSE IN ANY WARD THAT HAS A CONSIDERABLE PROBLEM WITH CRIMINAL ACTIVITY. AND I WAS CHARGED OVER $100 TO RECEIVE THOSE REPORTS. I NEEDED THOSE REPORTS TO REPRESENT MY CONSTITUENT. THIS PARTICULAR WAIVER IS WITH REGARD TO MR. HAYNER'S REQUEST FOR EMAILS. EMAILS REGARDING CITY BUSINESS THAT WERE SENT FROM A PERSONAL EMAIL ACCOUNT. WHICH VIOLATES ONE OF OUR COUNCIL RULES. I BELIEVE HE'S PERFORMING HIS DUTIES AS COUNCILMEMBER IN ASKING FOR THAT INFORMATION. HE'S NOT LOOKING TO SEE PERSONAL EMAILS. JUST EMAILS ABOUT CITY BUSINESS, SENT FROM A PERSONAL EMAIL ACCOUNT IN VIOLATION OF OUR COUNCIL RULES. IT'S BEEN SUGGESTED IN THE PAST THAT WE COULD USE OUR COUNCIL ACCOUNTS TO COVER THIS EXPENSE. AND THE REQUEST THAT WAS MADE FOR GELMAN PLUME DATA, THERE'S A PRICE TAG IN EXCESS OF $600. IT WOULD NOT TAKE VERY LONG FOR A COUNCILMEMBER DOING THEIR JOB TO EXCEED THE ALLOWANCE THAT WE HAVE PROVIDED OURSELVES FOR EXPENSES. LATER THIS YEAR, WE WILL BE CONSIDERING A BROADER APPROACH TO THE QUESTION OF WHETHER ANY COUNCILMEMBER SHOULD EVER HAVE TO PAY FOR INFORMATION THAT THEY REQUEST TO PERFORM THEIR DUTIES BUT UNTIL THAT POINT IN TIME, I DON'T THINK THAT WE SHOULD BE CHARGING COUNCILMEMBERS AND I'M ASKING THAT THIS PARTICULAR FOIA REQUEST FEE BE WAVED WHILE WE WAIT FOR THE FULLER DISCUSSION AS TO WHETHER WE SHOULD EVER HAVE TO PAY A FOIA FEE FOR INFORMATION WE NEED TO DO OUR JOBS. SO I HOPE YOU WILL SUPPORT THIS.
03:32:06.005: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
03:32:07.106: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. I -- I WON'T GO LONG BECAUSE I PROBABLY WANT TO SPEAK TWICE ON THIS. I JUST HAVE A PROBLEM SUPPORTING THIS FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS. I FEEL THAT COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER SHOULD BE A SPONSOR OR A COSPONSOR OF THIS, AND I DON'T SEE THAT. I BELIEVE ALSO THAT THIS SETS BAD PRECEDENT. I THINK IF THIS WAS SOMETHING LIKE THE GELMAN PLUME, IT HAS BEEN A PUBLIC THREAT FOR 40 YEARS AND WE ARE INVOLVED IN LITIGATION AND MANY ACTIONS TAKEN BY COUNCIL TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE, THEN THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING. BUTZBUT THIS IS -- ITCOULD BE IA FISHING EXPEDITION OR A WITCH HUNT. I THINK IF THERE WAS A BIGGER DIRECTLY BY COUNCIL TO LOOK INTO THIS MATTER, THEN THIS SHOULD FIT INTO WHAT THE COUNCILMEMBER EATON HAS TALKED ABOUT, US HAVING AC ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION IF THIS WAS PART OF THE LARGER INVESTIGATION INTO A COMPLAINT, THEN I COULD SEE THAT. SO I FEEL LIKE THE LEVEL, THE THRESHOLD THAT I WOULD FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH HASN'T BEEN MET. I'M OPEN EARS. I WOULD LIKE TO BE CONVINCED OTHERWISE. IF SO, THEN THAT MAY INFLUENCE MY DECISION, BUT I DON'T FEEL THE THRESHOLD IS THERE. I THINK THERE SHOULD BE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE RESOURCES THAT WE TAKE, IN DOING THIS. AND, YOU KNOW, THOSE ARE PRECIOUS RESOURCES AND THOSE ARE TAXPAYER DOLLARS AND IF THERE'S AN ISSUE HERE, THEN LET'S TALK ABOUT IT AND THEN THIS WILL FIT INTO THAT LARGER ISSUE.
03:34:12.465: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
03:34:14.433: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I'M NOT A COSPONSOR BECAUSE I'M NOT EVEN ALLOWED TO SPEAK ON IT, WITH YOUR INDULGENCE, I WILL ASK FOR YOUR RECUSAL AS THE FIRST TIME THIS WAS ON OUR AGENDA.
03:34:25.178: >> Mayor Taylor: MOVED BY? COUNCILMEMBER EATON, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM. DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, YOU ARE EXCUSED.
03:34:38.024: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM AND THEN GRAND.
03:34:39.992: >> Councilmember Lumm: SO WHEN WE POSTPONED THIS ON AUGUST 5th, IT WAS A 9-2 VOTE AND COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI AND I VOTED NO. THIS IS THE SAME RESOLUTION AS AUGUST 5th. I AM -- AND WE ALSO APPROVED A RESOLUTION DIRECTING THE ADMINISTRATOR TO LOOK AT THE FOIA FEE PROCESS OVERALL. AS I INDICATED ON AUGUST 5th, I INDICATED I WOULD SUPPORT THIS BEFORE IT WAS POSTPONED AND NOTHING HAS CHANGED. SO I SEE NO REASON TO CHANGE MY VOTE. I WON'T REPEAT WHAT I SAID ON AUGUST 5th. I THINK IN THE RARE INSTANCE WHEN A COUNCILMEMBER DOES BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT AND SERVES THE PUBLIC INTEREST, I DON'T THINK THAT THEY SHOULD BE CHARGED AND ALSO IF FOLKS WANT TO POSTPONE AGAIN AND WAIT ON THIS UNTIL THE REPORT COMES BACK FOR THE ADMINISTRATOR ON THE OVERALL PROCESSING AND FEES FOR FOIA, I'M OKAY WITH THAT TOO.
03:35:48.127: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
03:35:49.829: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. I WON'T BE SUPPORTING THIS THIS EVENING. I HAVE MAJOR CONCERNS ABOUT WAIVING FOIA FEES FOR COUNCIL AND THE CONTENTION THAT HAS BEEN MADE THAT COUNCILMEMBERS ALONE SHOULD DETERMINE WHAT IS COUNCIL BUSINESS FOR FOIA. I THINK IT LEAVES US OPEN TO ABUSES WHERE COUNCILMEMBERS COULD FEEL THAT PART OF THEIR COUNCIL BUSINESS IS MAKING REQUESTS FOR CONSTITUENTS FOR FOIA. OR THAT THEY COULD BE INFLUENCED TO BELIEVE THAT THAT WAS THE CASE. YOU KNOW, I -- WE DO HAVE A PROCESS FOR BRINGING FORWARD FOIA WAIVERS WHERE WE BRING IT FORWARD TO COUNCIL. I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS ONE OF THOSE CASES BUT DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE INTENT OF FOIA MEETS THAT THRESHOLD FOR ME TO SUPPORT A WAIVER.
03:36:43.883: >> Mayor Taylor: I'M GOING TO BE VOTING AGAINST THIS. I WILL NOTE THAT THERE IS AN INTERVENING PIECE OF INFORMATION BETWEEN THIS VOTE AND THE PRIOR VOTE AND THAT IS THE LEGAL ADVICE THAT WE HAVE RECEIVED FROM OUR CITY ATTORNEY ON THIS VERY POINT. LEGAL ADVICE, WHICH I VIEW AS UNEQUIVOCAL. THE NOTION THAT CITY COUNCILMEMBERS SHOULD GET SOME KIND OF SPECIAL TREATMENT WITH RESPECT TO FOIA FEES IS, TO ME, SHOCKING. MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC ARE ASKED TO PAY FEES IN ORDER TO OFFSET AND ACCOMMODATE THAT AND PAY FOR THE TIME SERVED, THE TIME EXPENDED AND THE RESOURCES EXPENDED BY CITY STAFF TO FULFILL FOIA REQUESTS. WE ARE NOT -- WE ARE NOT IN ANY MORE PRIVILEGED POSITION THAN MEMBERS THE PUBLIC IN THIS CONTEXT, AND I'M -- LIKE I SAID, I'M SHOCKED AND SURPRISED THAT ANYONE ELSE SHOULD THINK SO. FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
03:37:44.744: >> Councilmember Nelson: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. THERE ARE A COUPLE OF BITS AND PIECES THAT I THINK HAVE BEEN MISSING FROM THIS DISCUSSION. FIRST OF ALL, I HAVE TROUBLE SUPPORTING THIS BECAUSE IT FEELS FAR TOO SPECIFIC AND FRANKLY, I'M LOOKING TO A BROADER DISCUSSION ABOUT OUR FOYA. POLICY, AND SO THAT POINT, I -- IN ONE OF MY REGULAR COFFEE HOURS WHEN THIS ISSUE BUBBLED UP, I HAD A CONSTITUENT COME TO ME AND REALLY INTERESTED IN TALKING ABOUT THIS ISSUE. HE'S RECENTLY MOVED HERE FROM OHIO. AND I THOUGHT, OH, MY GOSH, YOU KNOW, IN IS LIKE -- THIS LOOKS TO POLITICAL. HE'S GOING TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT HOW GOSH, ANN ARBOR'S POLITICS ARE REALLY CRAZY! AND ACTUALLY, HIS VIEW POINT WAS THAT IT SHOCKED HIM THAT WE WERE EVEN DISCUSSING FOIA FEES BECAUSE IN THE STATE OF OHIO, FOIAS ARE FREE. THEIR INTERPRETATION OF FREEDOM OF INFORMATION IS THAT THE INFORMATION SHOULD BE FREE. AND I HAVE ASKED OUR LEGAL DEPARTMENT TO EXPLORE HOW THE STATE OF OHIO MANAGES TO ACCOMPLISH THIS WITHOUT BEING BURIED IN FOIA REQUESTS. SOMEHOW STAFF -- MUNICIPALLY IS STAFFS ARE ABLE TO COPE WITH FOIAS THAT COME IN WITHOUT THE DETERRENT OF COST. I GUESS THE ONLY OTHER COMMENT I WANT TO MAKE ON THIS ISSUE AND, AGAIN, I WILL SAY THAT I'M NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IN ITEM ON THE AGENDA. I -- IT CONCERNS ME THAT SOMEBODY WOULD DESCRIBE THIS AS A FIS FISHING EXPEDITION. I SUPPOSE IT HAS NOT BEEN STATED DIRECTLY AT THIS, BUT THE ORIGINS OF THIS PARTICULAR FOIA CAME FROM A VERY PUBLIC SORT OF ADVERTISEMENT THAT CITY BUSINESS WAS BEING CONDUCTED ON A PRIVATE EMAIL ACCOUNT. AND SO I THINK THE CRUX OF THIS ISSUE IS NOT SO MUCH A FISHING EXPEDITION, BECAUSE THE INFORMATION WAS PUBLICIZED AND PUT ONLINE. I THINK THE QUESTION ACTUALLY IS HOW ARE WE DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN WHAT IS COUNCIL WORK AND WHAT IS POLITICAL BUSINESS. AND THAT IS WHAT I HEARD THE LAST TIME THIS ISSUE WAS BROUGHT UP, WAS THIS CAREFUL DISTINCTION OF, WELL, TECHNICALLY IT WAS A PRIVATE ACCOUNT BUT I'M CATEGORIZING IT AS POLITICAL. AND I -- I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT DISCUSSION WORTH HAVING. SO, AGAIN, I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS AGENDA ITEM, BUT I LOOK FORWARD TO FUTURE DISCUSSION OF OUR FOIA POLICY. THANKS.
03:40:12.558: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOLT STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER. I'M SORRY, COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER. MY APOLOGIES.
03:40:22.434: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES.
03:40:23.802: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES.

03:40:41.987: >> Mayor Taylor: DC-2, RESOLUTION TO APPROVE A REQUEST FROM ANN ARBOR SENIOR LIVING OWNER, LLC FOR A NEW CONTINUING CARE RETIREMENT CENTER LIQUOR LICENSE, NEW SDM LIQUOR LICENSE, SUNDAY SALES PERMIT, A.M. AND P.M., DANCE ENTERTAINMENT PERMIT OUTDOOR SERVICE PERMIT AND SPECIFIC PURPOSE PERMIT ISSUED UNDER MCL436.1546B2 AND BE LOCATED AT 23830 ST. MAIN STREET.
03:41:14.086: >> Councilmember Lumm: IT'S TO GRANT LICENSES TO BALANCE FOUR FOR THE NEW SENIOR LIVING FACILITY ON SOUTH MAIN. BALFOUR WANTS TO EXPAND ON THE AMENITIES TO THEIR RESIDENTS AND GUESTS. ALL THE RELEVANT CITY DEPARTMENTS HAVE REVIEWED APPROVED THE APPLICATION AND THE COMMITTEE RECOMMENDS YOUR APPROVAL. THANK YOU.
03:41:30.336: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. IN ALL IN FAVOR. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. DC-3, RESOLUTION IN SUPPORT OF LEGISLATION REINSTATING STATE HISTORIC PRESERVATION TAX CREDITS:  SENATE BILL 54 AND HOUSE BILL 4100. MOVED BY HAYNER AND SECONDED BY BANISTER. ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED IT'S AMOVED. DC-4, RESOLUTION TO APPROVE AN AGREEMENT WITH AVALON HOUSING REIMBURSEMENT OF SERVICES REELIMINATED TO 1146, MOVED BY SMITH AND SECONDED BY RAMLAWI. DISCUSSION OF DC-4. ALL IN FAVOR. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT'S APRO OFFED.
03:42:15.014: >> DC-5, RESOLUTION TO SUPPORT AN AUTHORIZE STAFF PARTICIPATION OF WASHTENAW COUNTY CLIMATE STRIKE ON SEPTEMBER 20, 2019. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER NELSON. DISCUSSIONS OF DC-5. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
03:42:28.661: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I HAD A CURIOUS EMAIL FROM A RESIDENT AND THEY MADE A GOOD POINT ABOUT THIS. I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S NO COST TO THE TAXPAYER AS IT WAS BY LETTING OUR STAFF GO DOWN TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS POLITICAL ACTION BECAUSE THEY ARE GOING TO BE USING UP THEIR PERSONAL TIME, THEIR WHATEVER TIMES THEY HAVE TO FREE NEXTSELVES FROM WORK THAT DAY. BUT THE RESIDENT DID EXPRESS CONCERN THAT CITY COUNCIL WOULD EXPLICITLY ALLOW FOLKS THIS PERMISSIVE -- PROVIDE THAT THEY GO SEEK THIS SPECIFIC POLITICAL PURPOSE. AND, YOU KNOW, HE PUT IT MUCH BETTER ELOQUENTLY THAN I JUST DID, UNFORTUNATELY. BUT, YOU KNOW, I KIND OF HAD TO AGREE WITH HIM. I THINK IT'S A LITTLE UNUSUAL THAT WE WOULD SINGLE OUT THIS. I THINK THAT IF ANYBODY ON STAFF WANTED TO GO AND DO THIS ON THEIR TIME, THEY WOULD COME TO THE ADMINISTRATOR OR THEIR IMMEDIATE SUPERVISOR AND ASK FOR THAT TIME OFF AND I THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE GREAT AND I HOPE THAT THAT WOULD BE GRANTED TO THEM. I ASSUME IT WOULD BE. AND SO I'M NOT SURE WHY THIS IS COMING FROM CITY COUNCIL IN THIS CASE, WHY WE'RE ENCOURAGING FOLKS TO TAKE TIME OFF FOR ONE POLITICAL ACTION AND NOT ANOTHER, WHAT DOORS S DOES THIS OPEN TO US SAYING THIS IS A BETTER IDEA THAN ANOTHER, AND WE ALL SUPPORT -- I CAN'T SPEAK THAT WE ALL SUPPORT THIS. AS A BODY, WE MAY IF THIS VOTE PASSES BUT I'M NOT -- I'M NOT GOING TO VOTE FOR THIS BECAUSE I BELIEVE ANYBODY WHO WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THIS AT THE STAFF LEVEL WOULD ASK AND BE ALLOWED BY ADMINISTRATOR BUT WE KNOW THE ADMINISTRATOR SUPPORTS THE CLIMATE ACTIONS OF THE CITY LIKE I BELIEVE WE ALL DO. BUT I FIND IT AN UNUSUAL PRECEDENT TO BE SETTING. SO I -- I SUPPORT IT MORALLY. I CAN'T SUPPORT IT IN MY ELECTED POSITION.
03:44:24.343: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCICOUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
03:44:29.948: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. AND THANKS, COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER FOR BRINGING UP THAT EMAIL THAT WE RECEIVED. YOU KNOW, IT DOES BEG THE QUESTION THAT YOU BROUGHT UP WHETHER THIS IS POLITICALLY MOTIVATED OR NOT. AND I THINK WE'RE AT A POINT IN HUMANITY THAT THIS IS NOT ABOUT POLITICS. IT'S ABOUT BRINGING ATTENTION TO THE CURRENT STATE THAT WE ARE IN OR MASS EXTINCTION, OR UNDERGOING A MASS EXTINCTION AND I THINK BRINGING ATTENTION TO IT IS NOT A POLITICAL MOVE.
03:45:09.321: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD?
03:45:12.825: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WOULD LIKE TO BE LISTED AS A COSPONSOR.
03:45:17.696: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? I GUESS I WILL JUST SAY THAT, YOU KNOW, I SO MUCH APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS OF, YOU KNOW, PARTICULARLY -- WELL, COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND YOUTH MEMBERS WHO ARE TAKING THE LEAD IN ORGANIZING THE CLIMATE STRIKE. I KNOW THAT MANY STAFF MEMBERS ARE EAGER TO PARTICIPATE AND I'M GLAD THAT WE ARE ABLE TO -- YOU KNOW, AS IS THERE RIGHT WITH P.T.O. TIME, BUT WE ARE ABLE TO RATIFY THERE DOING SO BECAUSE AS COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI INDICATED, THIS IS AN EXISTENTIAL ISSUE AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT EVERYBODY BE ABLE AND HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK UP AND STAFF IS INCLUDED IN THAT. FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
03:45:58.570: >> Councilmember Hayner:  SO WHAT YOU JUST SAID IS INTERESTING AND SO WHY ARE WE SUPPORTING THEM SAYING OFF WORK FOR THIS THIS WHY DON'T WE JUST MAKE A RESOLUTION AS A BODY TO SUPPORT THE GREATER EFFORT AND ASK THE COMMUNITY TO JOIN US IN THE WASHTENAW COUNTY CLIMATE STRIKE. WHY IS IT GOING THROUGH THIS SORT OF RELEASING THE EMPLOYEES PATH? I'M JUST CURIOUS BECAUSE WE MADE ALL SORTS OF PROCLAMATIONS AND AT THE LAST-MINUTE AND THE START OF THIS MEETING. WHY DIDN'T WE JUST HAVE A PROCLAMATION SUPPORTING THE WASHTENAW COUNTY CLIMATE STRIKE EFFORTS? I'M ASKING YOU BECAUSE YOU ARE THE SPONSOR.
03:46:39.611: >> Mayor Taylor: IT HADN'T OCCURRED TO ME. IF YOU WANT TO INCLUDE AN AMENDMENT TO THE RESOLUTION, WHICH ENCOURAGES OTHERS TO PARTICIPATE, I WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO ENTERTAIN IT AND INCLUDE IT. THE POINT HERE WAS WE ARE AN EMPLOYER. EMPLOYEES OFTEN WONDER WHAT DOES THEIR EMPLOYER THINK OF IT. IT WAS MY HOPE TO TELL -- TO COMMUNICATE TO OUR EMPLOYEES THAT WE SUPPORT THE EFFORT.
03:47:01.066: >> Councilmember Hayner: OKAY. THANK YOU FOR THAT ANSWER.
03:47:03.535: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
03:47:08.607: >> Councilmember Hayner:  NO.
03:47:11.376: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES.
03:47:13.578: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES.

03:47:26.925: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION CARRIES. DC-6, RESOLUTION TO WAIVE A RIGHT FOR FIRST REFUSAL OF A PENDING SALE FOR $395,000 ON THE BOTSFORD PROPERTY, 3015 MILLER ROAD. MOVED BY HAYNER AND SECONDED. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
03:47:46.945: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I'M ROLLING OVER SO I CAN READ IT PROPERLY HERE. SO THE BOTSFORD PROPERTY IS A PROPERTY THAT'S BEEN KICKING AROUND FOR A WHILE AND IT CAME TO OUR ATTENTION, AS YOU KNOW THAT WE HAD THE RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL ON THIS PARCEL WHICH IS A PRETTY NICE PLACE AS ONE THE SPEAKERS EARLIER SPOKE TO IT. IT'S A REALLY NICE PROPERTY. I HAVE BEEN OUT THERE, WALKED AROUND ON THERE A BUNCH OF TIMES, AND, YOU KNOW, I WISH THAT -- I WISH THAT WE COULD MAKE THIS PURCHASE USING OUR GREEN BELT FUNDS. IT'S A SITUATION, AGAIN, THAT COMES UP FROM TIME TO TIME, WHERE THE APPRAISED VALUE IS LESS THAN WHAT THE OWNER IS ASKING FOR. AND WE'RE PROHIBITED FROM USING OUR FUNDS TO MAKE THOSE PURCHASES, WHEN IT'S LIKE THAT, UNLESS WE -- UNLESS WE CHOOSE TO DO SO WITH THE GENERAL FUNDS IS MY UNDERSTANDING. AND SO I JUST DON'T LIKE TO SEE THESE THINGS GO BY. WE HAD A SITUATION A FEW YEARS BACK WHERE WE -- WE -- NOT ME, BUT THE COUNCIL AT THAT TIME, BUT, YOU KNOW, BROUGHT UP THIS RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL ON THE EDWARDS BROTHERS PROPERTY AND PASSED ON IT AND I -- I THINK THAT WAS A MISTAKE LOOKING BACK MYSELF, ACTUALLY. I THINK THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A VERY VALUABLE TO US. AND THE TRUTH IS, I THINK THIS ONE COULD BE VALUABLE TO US ALSO, BUT THERE APPEARS TO BE NO GREAT ATTEMPTS TO PURCHASE IT AND SO I THINK IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO -- YOU KNOW, TO MAKE IT CLEAR TO THE SELLER THAT -- THAT WE'RE GOING TO PASS ON THIS AND SO THAT'S WHAT THIS RESOLUTION BEFORE US DOES. I -- I -- YOU KNOW, I SUPPOSE IT COULD BE AMENDED IF SOMEBODY HAS THE STOMACH FOR BUYING THIS BUT I FEEL LIKE IT WOULD HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESSES AND THROUGH P.A.C. AND SO ON AND IT DIDN'T -- YOU KNOW, IT DIDN'T IN THIS OPPORTUNITY. IT'S JUST GOING TO FADE AWAY. I JUST FEEL IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO ACT OR NOT ACT ON THESE THINGS AS WE SEE APPROPRIATELYHESE THINGS.
03:49:52.604: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, BANNISTER.
03:49:54.673: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD, COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER. I SUPPORT THIS AND I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MY NAME ADDED AS A SPONSOR. I AGREE IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE FOR FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE TO START PURCHASING PROPERTIES AT PREMIUMS OVER MARKET. THE GREENBELT ADVISORY COMMISSION AND THE PARKS ADVISORY COMMISSION RECOGNIZED THAT. AND THEY HAVE ADVISED AGAINST EXERCISING THE RIGHT ON THE TWO PREVIOUS OCCASIONS, AND THEY ARE RIGHT. THIS PRICE IS STILL -- THIS PRICE IS ABOVE APPRAISED VALUE. IT'S STILL $50,000 OVER THE APPRAISAL AND I REALLY THINK IT WOULD BE FISCALLY IRRESPONSIBLE TO, AGAIN, PURCHASE THE PROPERTY AND THIS IS IN SIRE TOWNSHIP AT OVER MARKET PRICES. SO THANK YOU.
03:50:49.427: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? I'M SORRY. COUNCILMEMBER GRAND AND THEN BANNISTER.
03:50:53.665: >> Councilmember Grand: I WANTED TO POINT OUT A COUPLE OF OTHER REASONS WHY BUYING THIS PROPERTY WAS NOT SUPPORTED. ONE, WE DO HAVE AN ACCESS EASEMENT TO THE -- SO THE BOTSFORD PROPERTY WAS ORIGINALLY IN TWO PIECES. THE ONE OF HIGHER ECOLOGICAL VALUE GOT PUT INTO CONSERVATION THROUGH THE GREEN BELT PROGRAMBM MANY YEARS AGO AND THEN GREEN BELT, THE OTHER GREENBELT PARTICIPATED IN PURCHASING SOME OTHER LAND WITH THE COUNTY THAT WAS CONTIGUOUS TO THAT PROPERTY. IT WAS ALSO HIGHER ECOLOGICAL VALUE. THERE ALSO WOULD BE NOT SO INSIGNIFICANT COSTS TO PARKS TAKING THIS ON ABOVE AND BEYOND MAINTENANCE OF NATURAL AREAS AND THAT THERE ARE SOME DANGEROUS STRUCTURES ON THIS PROPERTY AND SO IF WE WERE TO PURCHASE IT UNDER THE GREENBELT THAT BURDEN WOULD FALL TO THE PARK SYSTEM. SO -- AND ALSO, THERE ARE, I THINK, LEGITIMATE CONCERNS ABOUT UNTIL THOSE PROPERTIES WERE REMOVED, YOU KNOW, WHAT ARE THE DANGERS OF OWNING A PROPERTY THAT HAS DANGEROUS STRUCTURES ON IT? SO I REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT WE LEVERAGED OUR GREENBELT DOLLARS VERY EFFECTIVELY TO GET THE PROPERTIES THAT ARE -- ARE OF MOST VALUE IN TERMS OF THEIR NATURAL FEATURES. AND IN ADDITION, ALONG THE ROAD, WE ALREADY HAVE A STRIP THAT GIVES THE PUBLIC ACCESS TO THOSE PROPERTIES. SO -- SO THIS PROPERTY IS KIND OF BOUND BY THAT. SO TO ME, I DON'T THINK THAT IT WAS NECESSARILY OF VALUE AT EVEN WHAT IT WAS APPRAISED. AND KNOW THAT HE WITH WANT TOO USE -- AND KNOW THAT WE WANT TO USE THOSE DOLLARS FOR LAND THAT REALLY DOES ADD VALUE TO THE COMMUNITY AND I DON'T BELIEVE THIS PIECE OF PROPERTY REALLY DOES.
03:52:48.013: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
03:52:50.081: >> Councilmember Bannister: WELL -- AS MANY OF YOU KNOW, WE, AND ME TOO, HAVE BEEN RECEIVING A LOT OF INQUIRIES LATELY ABOUT WHY WE HAVEN'T BEEN USING THAT ONE-THIRD OF THE GREENBELT MONEY THAT WAS DESIGNATED FOR PURCHASES WITHIN THE CITY FOR SPECIAL PROPERTIES. AND SO THIS BOTSFORD PROPERTY IS ONE OF SEVEN TO EIGHT PROPERTIES THAT SOME OF YOU HAVE SEEN MY LIST THAT I HAVE ASSEMBLED FROM THE RESIDENTS. AND SO THIS PROPERTY -- THIS BOTSFORD PROPERTY -- I TALKED TO SOME RESIDENTS THIS AFTERNOON. THE STRUCTURES ON IT ARE DON BOTSFORD'S LIFE WORK IN FITNESS AND NATURE. AND THIS PARTICULAR PROPERTY ON 3015 MILLER ROAD IS HIS FOREST SANCTUARY. IT'S A VISION, KIND OF LIKE WALDO EMERSON OR SOME OF THOSE HISTORIC PEOPLE WHERE -- SO THOSE ARE THE STRUCTURES THAT COUNCILMEMBER GRAND IS TALKING ABOUT. IT'S PROBABLY HIS LIFE'S WORK IN FITNESS AND NATURE OUT THERE AND IT'S A FOREST SANCTUARY AND HIS VISION. AND SO, I AM REPRESENTING MY WARD ONE RESIDENTS WHO HAVE TOLD ME THAT THIS PARTICULAR PROPERTY, ALTHOUGH IT'S NOT IN WARD ONE, IT'S -- IT IS ONE OF THE HALF A DOZEN OR SO PROPERTIES THAT THEY WOULD LIKELY -- THEIR ACCUMULATED DOLLARS, IT'S OVER 6 MILLION ACCUMULATED FROM THE GREEN BELT MILLAGE THAT FOR SOME REASON OVER THESE LAST 15 YEARS HAS RARELY BEEN USED TO PURCHASE THESE PROPERTIES AND NOW I'M -- AS WE KNOW, WE ARE HEARING FROM A LOT MORE RESIDENTS THAT THEY ARE REQUESTING WHY WE AREN'T USING THE MONEY. SO I'M SUGGESTING SAY NO ON THIS. AND WORK ON BUYING. IT THANK YOU.
03:55:12.223: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI AND THEN GRAND.
03:55:15.927: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I APPRECIATE WHAT THE COMMUNITY HAS SAID ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR PROPERTY. I HAVEN'T HAD THE COMMUNITY TO UNDERSTAND MORE OF THE OWNER'S CURRENT POSITION. UNFORTUNATELY, THE WISHES OF THE PERSON WOULD HAD -- YOU HAD ARTICULATED COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTERRER, THE PEOPLE WOULD OWN THE PROPERTY ARE ASKING MORE MONEY THAN IT'S BEING APPRAISED FOR. SO JUST FRANKLY, IF THEY FELT AS STRONGLY AS THOUGH PEOPLE IN THEIR COMMUNITY FEEL, THAT ASKING PRICE WOULD MEET THE APPRAISAL PRICE AND I JUST HAVE A HARD TIME, YOU KNOW, MATCHING THOSE TWO THINGS UP. IF THAT'S WHAT REALLY -- AND I CAN'T -- I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK FOR OTHERS, BUT, I MEAN, IF THAT'S WHAT, YOU KNOW, THE -- THE ORIGINAL OWNER INTENDED TO BE DONE FOR THIS, THEN PERHAPS THE ASKING PRICE SHOULD BE A LITTLE LOWER THAN WHAT IT IS, AND MEETS MORE WITH THE APPRAISAL.
03:56:23.628: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
03:56:24.462: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. I JUST WANT TO COUNTERCOUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER'S POINT ABOUT -- AND I WON'T BELABOR THIS POINT BECAUSE I EXPLAINED TIME AND TIME AGAIN HOW PARKS MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT LAND AND HOW THEY USE CRITERIA TO DO SO. SO I WON'T GO BACK TO THAT, BUT IN TERMS OF THE STRUCTURES, ONE CAN HAVE A VISION THAT COULD BE WITH NATURE OR ANYTHING POSITI BUT THE POINT IF MY VISION FOR SOMETHING WAS BARBED WIRE AND BROKEN GLASS, IT'S STILL DANGEROUS. AND THESE STRUCTURES ARE DANGEROUS. SO WE SHOULDN'T BE SUPPORTING A PURCHASE, ONE, AS MY COLLEAGUES HAVE MENTIONED THAT'S OVER THE APPRAISED VALUE BUT ALSO ONE THAT PUTS OUR RESIDENTS IN DANGER. SO FRANKLY IF -- YOU KNOW, RESIDENTS THAT HAVE OPINIONS, THAT WE SHOULD BE PURCHASING SOMETHING, BUT WE HAVE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT IS OUR ROLE AS COUNCILMEMBERS TO BRING THAT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO OUR DECISION DECISION-MAKING PROCESS JUST LIKE THE PARK ADVISORY AND THE LAND ACQUISITION COMMITTEE HAS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WHEN THEY ARE MAKING DECISIONS AND I BELIEVE HAS REALLY BEEN JUDICIOUS STEWARDS OF THOSE DOLLARS AND THEY ARE EXPENSIVE CONTRIBUTE TO OUR COMMUNITIES NEEDS THAT WILL HAVE THEM -- THAT WILL HAVE THAT PROPERTY FOR GENERATIONS TO COME BECAUSE WE WERE JUDICIOUS WITH THOSE FUNDS.
03:58:02.193: >> Mayor Taylor: IT'S 11:00. WE HAVE A LOT TO GO. CAN I WILL SUGGEST THAT WE ARE DONE WITH THIS.
03:58:05.229: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WANT TO SAY ONE THING, IF I MAY.
03:58:08.433: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
03:58:10.201: >> Councilmember Hayner:  IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE PRINGLE PROPERTY THAT'S ADJACENT TO THIS AND THIS CONSERBATION EASEMENT ARE THERE. IF THIS PROPERTY IS SOLD, THE CONSERVATION EASEMENT STAYS ON THAT PORTION OF THAT, AS SHOWN ON THE MAP, IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY. OR IS THE CONSERBATION EASEMENT GOING TO DISAPPEAR WITH THE SALE OF THE PROPERTY. DO YOU KNOW?
03:58:30.922: >> Councilmember Grand: MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT --
03:58:32.223: >> Mayor Taylor: THE EASEMENT RUNS WITH THE LAND.
03:58:35.693: >> Councilmember Grand: YES. BUT IT RUNS WITH THE SECOND HALF OF THE LAND, AS WELL AS THAT ACCESS STRIP ALONG THE EDGE.
03:58:41.933: >> Councilmember Hayner:  WHAT IS ADJACENT TO THE SPRINKLE PROPERTY, THE CONSERVATION EASEMENT THAT THEY HOPEFULLY SHADED.
03:58:48.973: >> Councilmember Grand: YES.
03:58:49.574: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU, CHRIS.
03:58:51.843: >> I DIYES, THE CONSERVATION EASEMENT PASSES. NO STRUCTURES CAN BE BUILT THERE AND THE PUBLIC DOES HAVE ACCESS FROM THE ROAD.
03:59:01.519: >> Councilmember Hayner: OKAY. I WANTED TO MAKE SURE OF THAT. I THINK THE CONCERN IS THAT EVERY TIME THIS HAS COME UP, AND COME BEFORE P.A.C. AND, YOU KNOW, BEFORE MY TIME ON P.A.C., THE PRICE HAS BEEN MUCH HIGHER AND THE PRICE HAS BEEN COMING DOWN AND COMING DOWN AND NOW 50,000 OF THIS PRICE RELATIVE TO $350,000 PURCHASE, IT'S NOT SO FAR OFF. IT'S NOT SO UNTHINKABLE AND YET IT DOESN'T HAVE THAT RATING AND HERE IT'S ABOUT TO EXPIRE. AND I'M JUST GOING TO MAKE THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE ADJACENT OFFICE PARK IS GOING TO SNATCH THIS UP AND PUT A PARKING LOT THERE OR SOMETHING. THAT WILL BE UNFORTUNATE, BUT THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT WILL GO. BUT I'M HAPPY TO HEAR THAT THE EASEMENT IS GOING TO STAY BECAUSE THE PRINGLE PROPERTY NEXT TO IT -- YEAH, IT'S NOT EVEN IN THE CITY, AND SO IT'S NOT EVEN OUR TAX ISSUE TO WORRY ABOUT. I'M JUST RELIEVED THAT THE -- THAT THAT EASEMENT IS GOING TO STAY, BECAUSE IT'S MS. GRAND POINTED OUT, THAT IS THE NICER HALF, YOU MIGHT SAY. AND IT CREATES THAT CONTIGUOUSNESS AND THAT'S WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS.
04:00:03.014: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
04:00:08.152: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES.

04:00:47.959: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I'M SORRY IT'S COME TO THIS, THAT WE ARE PUTTING OUT $430,000 OUT OF OUR POCKET TO CLEAN THIS UP, AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THESE TAPTYPES OF THINGS WILL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN BECAUSE WE DO PHASE ONE INSPECTIONS OF ALL ACQUISITIONS IF I UNDERSTAND THAT CORRECTLY AND I WANT TO THANK TETRA TECH FOR ANYWHERE QUICK ACTION AND FOR HAVING THIS STANDING CONTRACT WITH THEM, SO THAT THEY COULD ACT QUICKLY ON THIS. AND I UNDERSTAND WITH SPEAKING WITH COUNCILMEMBER SMITH AT THE BREAK. I DON'T THINK THIS HAD NO GO TO RFP BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THAT CONTRACT; IS THAT CORRECT, MR. LAZARUS? IT'S A PRETTY BIG CHUNK OF CHANGE TO NOT HAVE --
04:01:34.839: >> THIS IS AWARDED ON A BEST SOURCE. TETRA TECH IS THE ON-CALL ENVIRONMENTAL ADVISOR BOTH WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERS AND SEVERAL DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS. THEY HAVE GONE THROUGH SEVERAL RFP PROCESSES IN THE CITY. WE ARE VERY FAMILIAR WITH THEIR WORK AND SO BECAUSE OF THE WORK THAT THEY DO FOR THE CITY, THIS WAS PUT FORTH ON A BEST SOURCE BASIS, BUT ALSO BECAUSE WHEN THIS ISSUE WAS DISCOVERED, IF YOU RECALL, WORK WAS COMMENCED ON AN EMERGENCY BASIS, TO BRING THEM IN AND BEGIN AN ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT OF THE PROPERTY, AND WE DID NOT THINK IT PRUDENT TO SWITCH CONSULTANTS IN THE MIDDLE OF PROJECT.
04:02:15.546: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I APPRECIATE THAT. IF THE FOLKS AT HOME WOULD HAVE SEEN THE PRESENTATION TO BACK, THEY WOULD KNOW HOW URGENT THIS ISSUE IS. I'M SORRY WE GOT OURSELVES IN THIS PASSION '70s OR WHATEVER, BUT HOPEFULLY IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN AND THANK YOU FOR SUPPORTING THIS. IT'S JUST -- IT HAS TO HAPPEN.
04:02:34.332: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
04:02:38.135: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YEAH, I JUST HAVE A -- I GUESS A TIMELINE. HOW LONG ARE WE LOOKING FOR THIS TO BE -- TO BE COMPLETED AND JUST, YOU KNOW, APPRECIATE THE SENTIMENTS THAT COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER BROUGHT UP, I ASSUME, I THINK THIS IS ALL GIFTED TO US?
04:02:59.657: >> THE LAND -- EXCUSE ME, LAND WAS.
04:03:01.659: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES.
04:03:02.760: >> FROM DR. LESLIE.
04:03:04.795: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  SO IT'S A SMALL PRICE TO PAY, I GUESS FOR SOMETHING THAT WAS GIVEN TO US. SO THAT PART DOESN'T CONCERN ME AS MUCH, BUT IF I COULD JUST GET SOME TIME FRAME ON WHEN THIS WOULD ALL BE COMPLETED.
04:03:19.543: >> SURE. I'M PATTY McCALL OF TETRA TECH. SO OUR HOPE IS THAT IT'S COMPLETED IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS. IT'S ALL DEPENDENT ON SCHEDULING WITH THE CONTRACTORS AND THEIR AVAILABILITY.
04:03:31.856: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  AND I'M SORRY, I DON'T HAVE THE -- I'M NOT PRIVY TO THE CONVERSATIONS, PARKS PEOPLE ARE. IS -- ALL ACTIVITY CEASED AT THIS LOCATION? IS THERE ANYTHING GOING TO -- GOING ON?
04:03:49.840: >> THERE HAVE BEEN SOME PROGRAMMATIC ADJUSTMENTS FROM THE NONPROFIT, THE LESLIE SCIENCE CENTER, SPECIFICALLY PROGRAMS THAT DEAL WITH THE CHILDREN, AND THE DAY CAMPS AND THINGS LIKE THAT WERE MOVED OFFSITE TO AN ALTERNATIVE SITE, I THINK TO BURR PARK AND ALL OF THEIR PROGRAMMING CONTINUED THROUGHOUT THE SUMMER. IT JUST DIDN'T TAKE PLACE ON SITE AT THE LESLIE SCIENCE AND NATURE CENTER. THOSE OFFICES ARE STILL THERE. THE RAPTORS ARE STILL THERE. THE PARK ITSELF IS STILL OPEN. WE HAVE PUT SIGNS UP ALERTING PEOPLE TO WHAT'S GOING ON BUT PEOPLE ARE STILL FREE TO WALK THROUGH IT. SO --
04:04:22.006: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  ARE WE CONFIDENT THAT THAT THIS IS CONTAINED IN THIS SITE -- THE SOURCE -- THIS SITE OR DO WE KNOW IF IT'S IN OTHER PLACES IN THE AREA?
04:04:35.720: >> WE ARE CONFIDENT IN THE VALIDITY OF THE TESTING THAT WE HAVE DONE AND THE TESTING HAS BEEN EXTENSIVE. I'M NOT GOING TO RULE OUT WHAT ELSE MAY BE, YOU KNOW, WHEREVER ELSE ON THE PROPERTY, BUT WE HAVE DONE VERY EXTENSIVE TESTING ACROSS THE PROPERTY AND WE ARE VERY CONFIDENT THAT WE HAVE IDENTIFIED, YOU KNOW, A GOOD PORTION OF WHAT'S GOING ON THERE. CERTAINLY EVERYTHING NEEDS TO BE REMEDIATED.
04:05:01.345: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: OKAY. THANK YOU.
04:05:03.247: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] ALL OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED WITH TEN COUNCILMEMBERS PRESENT, THUS SATISFYING THE EIGHT VOTE REQUIREMENT. DC-8, RESOLUTION TO ACCEPT A $364,250 A.C.E.P. GRANT AND APPROVE AN A.C.E.P. GRANT COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT FOR CONSERVATION EASEMENT ON THE RUSSELL PROPERTY. MOVED BY GRAND AND HAYNER. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
04:05:34.445: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANKS. I HAVE A QUICK QUESTION ON THIS ONE. WHEN WE APPROVED APPLYING FOR THIS GRANT IN AUGUST OF 2018, I ASKED WHO ELSE WOULD BE PARTICIPATING IN THE FUNDING OF THE CONSERVATION EASEMENT. AND I -- AND THE RESPONSE WAS, QUOTE, IT IS LIKELY THAT THE COUNTY AND THE TOWNSHIP WILL ALSO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROJECT AND CONTRIBUTE FUNDING. SO MY QUESTION IS. IS THAT THE CASE AND WHAT ARE THE FUNDING SHARES FOR THE PURCHASE OF THIS CONSERVATION EASEMENT?
04:06:07.945: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. FROST?
04:06:08.646: >> I'M AFRAID I'M NOT AWARE OF THE CURRENT STATUS OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS. BUT THIS WILL BE COMING BACK BEFORE COUNCIL WITH WHATEVER CONTRIBUTIONS TO VOTE ON FOR THE FINAL PURCHASE. SO YOU WILL HAVE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO CONSIDER IT.
04:06:22.927: >> Councilmember Lumm: I WILL SAY THANK YOU. I WILL JUST -- MY EXPECTATION IS THAT IT WILL -- THAT WE WILL SEE COUNTY AND TOWNSHIP PARTICIPATION AND A FUNDING CONTRIBUTION. THIS PROPERTY IS IN LODI TOWNSHIP. THANKS.
04:06:43.414: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. DC-9, RESOLUTION DIRECTING REVIEW EVER CITY TRANSPORTATION PLANNING AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STAFFERRING. MOVED BY GRISWOLD, AND SECONDED BY BANNISTER.

DC-10, RESOLUTION TO PROMOTE EFFECTIVE MITIGATION OF TRAFFIC IMPACTS RESULTING FROM SITE REENGINEERING BY ENTITIES EXEMPT FROM CITY JURISDICTION MOVED BY GRAZE WORLDGRISWOLD AND LUMM? COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
04:07:38.402: >> Councilmember Griswold:  WE HAD A MAJOR PROBLEM AT HURON HIGH SCHOOL FOR OVER EYE YEAR NOW. THERE WERE EXAMPLES OF -- I GOT AN EMAIL GOING BACK TO JUNE OF 2018 PRIOR TO THIS EVEN BEING IMPLEMENTED WHERE CONCERNS WERE RAISED ABOUT IT. I KNOW THAT THERE WAS A SITE VISITH THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR, AND AT LEAST TWO STAFF MEMBERS. ONE OF MY CONCERNS IS THAT WITHOUT A VISION ZERO OPERATIONALS MANAGER, THERE IS A VOID IN THE ORGANIZATION AND MANY PEOPLE ARE GETTING INVOLVED IN DECISIONS INCLUDING COUNCILMEMBERS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS. AND THIS IS JUST ONE MORE EXAMPLE OF THAT. IT HAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED TRAFFIC ON HURON PARKWAY, ON GEDDES AND FULLER ROAD. I WAS A MEMBER OF THE SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY COMMITTEE FOR OVER 15 YEARS. I WAS ON THE SCHOOL BOARD FOR FOUR YEARS. I WAS ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN THE HURON BOND IN THE EARLY 2000s, WELL, IT WAS ACTUALLY THE SKY LINE, AND SIGNIFICANT WORK WAS DONE AT HURON. I PROBABLY SET THROUGH FIVE DIFFERENT PLANNING PROCESSES FOR TRYING TO OPTIMIZE TRAFFIC AT HURON HIGH SCHOOL, INCLUDING CLOSING THE ARCH. AT NO TIME DID ANYONE, INCLUDING MANY CONSULTANTS FROM MIDWEST CONSULTING RECOMMEND THAT WE CLOSE OFF THE HURON PARKWAY LOOP TO VEHICULAR TRAFFIC FOR OUR PARENTS AND STUDENTS. MOST OF OUR SCHOOLS ARE DESIGNED TO HAVE TWO TWO DRIVEWAYS, NOT JUST ONE. AND WHEN JUSTIFICATION FOR THIS WAS WRITTEN UP BY THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR, IT CONTAINED NUMEROUS ERRORS, FACTUAL MISTAKES THAT I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY ORIGINATED, BUT, AGAIN, IF WE HAD A VISION ZERO OPERATIONS MANAGER, I THINK THAT THAT NONFACTUAL INFORMATION WOULD HAVE BEEN OBVIOUS.
04:09:53.070: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
04:09:54.004: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR AND THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD FOR TAKING A LEAD ON THIS. I'M HAPPY TO BE -- AISLE REPEAT. SORRY, MY MICROPHONE WAS NOT ON. THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD FOR TAKING THE LEAD ON THIS, AND, AGAIN, I'M HAPPY TO BE A COSPONSOR. TO ME, THIS RESOLUTION IS LOGICAL AND SOUND POLICY AND I HOPE YOU ALL AGREE. IN ANN ARBOR, THERE HAVE BEEN SITUATIONS WHERE INTERNAL ON-SIDE TRAFFIC PATTERNS AND FLOW CHANGES ARE MADE ON LARGE SITES BY MAJOR INSTITUTIONAL PROPERTY OWNERS LIKE THE U OF M AND THE INNER PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND THOSE INTERNAL ON-SITE CHANGES CAN IMPACT AND HAVE IMPACTED FLOWS AND SAFETY ON THE PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY ADJACENT TO THE PROPERTIES. A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THIS AS COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD WAS JUST ELABORATING ON, HAS BEEN AT HURON HIGH SCHOOL, WHERE INTERNAL TRAFFIC PATTERN CHANGES -- AND THIS HAS TO DO WITH THEIR PROPOSAL TO CHANGE THE DROPOFF PLAN FOR HURON HIGH SCHOOL THAT WAS INITIATED LAST YEAR. THOSE CHANGES HAVE RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT TRAFFIC FLOW IMPACTS ON HURON PARKWAY, FULLER, GEDDES ROAD, GEDDS DRIVE AND EAST HURON DRIVE. VEHICLES AS DESCRIBED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD CAN NO LONGER ENTER THE SCHOOL OFF HURON PARKWAY AND FOR ANYONE COMING INTO THIS AREA, FROM THE NORTH HU HURON PARKWAY AND THE SOUTH, FROM GEDDES ROAD, FULLER, THEY NEED TO PROCEED TO THE GEDDES FULLER AND TURN ON TO FULLER AND ENTER THE SCHOOL. I DON'T KNOW IF THE NET EFFECT OF THE CHANGES ARE SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS OR NOT. THE SCHOOLS HAVE MAINTAINED THAT IT'S ON CAMPUS. IT IS MORE SAFE, ALTHOUGH, I WILL JUST CH SHARE THAT I OBSER, FOLKS ALWAYS COME UP WITH AN ALTERNATIVE AP PLAN OF THEIR OW. WE HAVE PARENTS DROPPING OFF, PARKING VERY SHORT, BRIEFLY, ON HURON PARKWAY AND DROPPING THEIR KIDS OFF BECAUSE THEY CAN'T GET TO THE SCHOOL. SO I SHARED MANY OF THESE ANECDOTAL OBSERVATIONS WITH A.A.P.S., AND WITH CITY STAFF AND FRANKLY NOTHING HAS CHANGED. AND WE HAVE HEARD FROM A GREAT NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE -- WHO VIEW THESE CHANGES AS PROBLEMATIC. AND I KNOW IT HAS RESULTED IF A LOT MORE CONGESTION AT THE INTERSECTION AND ON THESE ROADS, IDLING VEHICLES AND USER CONCERNS ABOUT SAFETY. SO THAT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE THIS IS ONE EXAMPLE OF UNINTENDED --
04:12:59.990: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER?
04:13:00.858: >> Councilmember Lumm: OKAY. AND I SUSPECT THERE ARE THERE ARE OTHEROPTIONS, THAT THT ARE CONSIDERED UP FRONT. OF THE LASTLY, THE CITY AND WE CAN'T TELL MAJOR PROPERTY OWNERS LIKE THE U OF M, LIKE THE ANN ARBOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS WHAT TO DO INTERNALLY ON THEIR SITES BUT WE ENCOURAGE UP FRONT COLLABORATION WITH THE CITY. AND --
04:13:26.116: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER.
04:13:26.783: >> Councilmember Lumm: AND WE CAN ALSO -- I'M ALSO FINISHED. I'M WRAPPING UP. I'M ONLY GOING TO SPEAK TO THIS ONE TIME. WORK AT THE STATE POLICY LEVELS TOWARD -- THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR TWO YEARS IN OUR WARD AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD IS BRINGING THIS FORWARD. AND WE WORK AT THE STATE LEVEL REQUIRES THE CITY'S APPROVAL WHEN CHANGES TO ON-SITE TRAFFIC PATTERNS AT LARGE FACILITIES WILL LIKELY IMPACT -- ALL USERS OF A PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY.
04:13:59.750: >> Mayor Taylor: YOU ARE FOUR MINUTES NOW.
04:14:01.051: >> Councilmember Lumm: AND I HOPE THAT -- THIS IS IT FOR ME.
04:14:03.153: >> Mayor Taylor: I UNDERSTAND.
04:14:10.794: >> Councilmember Lumm: AND WILL ALL JOIN US IN SUPPORTING US TONIGHT AND I THINK IT WILL HELP ALL WARDS. SO THANKS FOR LISTENING AND, AGAIN, THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD FOR TAKING THE LEAD AND BRINGING IT FORWARD.
04:14:23.907: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. LAZARUS AND THEN COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
04:14:27.544: >> City Admin. Lazarus: MAYOR, THANK I JUST APPRECIATE THE FORWARD-LOOKING ASPECT OF THE RESOLUTION, WHICH I WORKED ON WITH MS. GRISWOLD. I DO TAKE EXCEPTION TO SOME OF THE CHARACTERIZATIONS OF THE WORK THAT WAS DONE IN TALKING TO BOTH THE ADMINISTRATORS FROM THE SCHOOL DISTRICT, PRINCIPAL, MR. STEVE DEERING FROM OHM, WOULD IS A NATIONAL PRACTICE LEADER, AND WAS INVOLVES IN VISION ZERO BEFORE THERE WAS A VISION ZERO. I THINK THESE DECISIONS ARE HARD TO MAKE. YOU HAVE MULTIPLE THINGS GOING ON AT THE SAME INTERSECTION. THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH REAL ESTATE AND, YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE GOALS OF VISION ZERO IS THAT YOU PRIORITIZE THE PEDESTRIAN SAFETY OVER ALL OTHER CONSIDERATIONS INCLUDING SPEED OF MOVEMENT, THAT WAS A HARD DECISION MADE WITH THE BEST AVAILABLE INPUT BUT THIS IS A FORWARD LOOKING RESOLUTION. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OUR PARTNERS AROUND THE CITY TO MOVE PEOPLE AROUND SAFELY BUT TO PRIORITIZE THE PEDESTRIAN SAFETY.
04:15:33.176: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
04:15:34.044: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES, I WILL SUPPORT THIS BECAUSE ANYTHING THAT CREATES MER COMMUNITY CONVERSATION AROUND THESE DIFFICULT ISSUE IS VALUABLE TO US. MY CONCERN IS WITH PUTTING A LOT ON YOUR PLATE, MR. LAZARUS BECAUSE AS WE KNOW THE UNIVERSITY AND THE SCHOOLS HAVE A SORT OF STATUTORY AUTONOMY IN THE THINGS THAT THEY DO AND I DON'T KNOW HOW WE CAN ENFORCE THIS OTHER THAN SORT OF THE FORCE OF WILL THAT CITY COUNCIL HAS BECAUSE WE DO PAY FOR THE ROADS BUT NONETHELESS, I SUPPORT IT AND I APPRECIATE YOU TAKING SOME TIME TO WORK ON THIS WITH COUNCIL WOMAN GRISWOLD AND HOPEFULLY THIS WILL LEAD TO BETTER OUTCOMES.
04:16:13.784: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. COUNCICOUNCILMEMBER GRAND AND TN GRISWOLD.
04:16:19.423: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. I HAVE A QUESTION FOR STAFF. THE FIRST TWO RESOLVE CLAUSES SPEAK TO BEST PRACTICE, I THINK, AND I THINK THAT'S TERRIFIC. I'M CONCERNED THAT THE THIRD ONE, IF YOU FOLLOW IT THROUGH ITS CONCLUSION, IF IT WERE APPROVED BY THE STATE WHICH I THINK IS UNLIKELY, BUT DOES GET A LITTLE OVERRICCI, AND SO HOW WOULD THESE ENTITIES IN PRACTICE AND I KNOW THIS IS HYPOTHETICAL ACTUALLY OBTAIN CITY APPROVAL? I JUST -- I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW THIS WOULD WORK IN PRACTICE. WOULD THIS HAVE TO COME TO COUNCIL? WOULD THERE BE A REVIEW BY STAFF? WHAT IS THAT? WHAT DOES THAT ACTUALLY LIKE IF THIS WERE TO COME TO PASS.
04:17:02.432: >> CRAIG HUPY. I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY WHAT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE. THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE WORKED THROUGH IF THERE WERE SUCH A FRAMEWORK SET UP.
04:17:16.646: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. I GUESS MY CONCERN IS SIMILAR TO THE CONCERNS THAT I HAVE HAD ABOUT SOME OF OUR RECENT ACTIONS WITH ROAD DIETS BUT THAT WE OVERREACH AND MICROMANAGE AND IF IT WERE TO COME TO COUNCIL FOR APPROVAL, THAT'S JUST IT, THE CONCERN I HAVE AT THIS TIME.
04:17:37.934: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
04:17:39.870: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY THAT STAFF WROTE THIS RESOLUTION. SO I'M SURE THEY HAD SOME INTENT FOR THAT SECTION. BUT -- AND SO I DON'T KNOW HOWARD LAZARUS, DO YOU WANT TO ADDRESS THAT OR IT'S LATE AND --
04:17:58.889: >> City Admin. Lazarus: I THINK MR. HUPY SAID THAT WORKING WITH THE STATE TO GET THE APPROVAL AUTHORITY, GOING THROUGH THAT PROCESS IT WILL RAISE ATTENTION AND AWARENESS IF WE ARE SUCCESSFUL, WE WILL HAVE TO COME ONE A WAY TO DO IT. BASICALLY, THE AUTHORITY ADMINISTRATIVELY TO ADDRESS CURB CUTS AND SITE ACCESS, THAT'S ONE TOOL. BUT WE'LL HAVE TO BE CREATIVE AS TO OTHER -- OTHER WAYS TO SEEK ENFORCEMENT.
04:18:28.985: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU.
04:18:29.820: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION.
04:18:30.687: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WANT TO BE BRUTALLY HONEST. WE HAVE PUT A POSITION IN THE BUDGET THIS FOR A SENIOR ENGINEER. WE DO NOT HAVE THAT POSITION AND AS A RESULT, WE HAVE HAD A LOT OF POLITICAL GAMESMANSHIP AND A LOT OF ISSUES HAVE COME TO THE COUNCIL AND COUNCIL HAS NOT ACCEPTED THEM. YOU CAN CALL THAT MICROMANAGING BUT WHEN THERE IS A CRITICAL VOID IN THE ORGANIZATION -- WE USED TO HAVE A CHIEF ENGINEER. WE DON'T ANYMORE. WHEN YOU HAVE THAT VOID IN THE -- WHEN YOU HAVE THAT VOID IN THE ORGANIZATION, MANY PEOPLE TRY TO FILL IT. AND THAT IS WHY WE CONTINUE TO HAVE AN INCREASE IN OUR CRASH RATE. IT'S WHY WE ARE NOW DOUBLING THE AMOUNT OF TRAFFIC IN A CROSSWALK WHERE WE HAD A TRAFFIC FATALITY IN 2016 BECAUSE THE CITY REFUSED TO LIGHT THAT CROSSWALK. SO WE ARE DOING THINGS INTENTIONALLY TO MAKE OUR CITY LESS SAFE. WE ALSO HAVE A CROSSWALK ORDINANCE THAT IS NOT SUPPORTED BY ENGINEERING AND WE HAVE NOT HAD A SENIOR ENGINEER OR A CHIEF ENGINEER SUCH AS PERUZ SINCE SHORTLY AFTER THAT ORDINANCE WAS PASSED. I THINK WE NEED TO BE BRUTALLY HONEST AND ADDRESS OUR SAFETY ISSUES. THANK YOU.
04:20:00.143: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION?
04:20:01.811: >> City Admin. Lazarus: I WOULD LIKE TO ADD SOMETHING. SO WE HAVE A TRANSPORTATION STAFF, WITH 40 YEARS OF COMBINED EXPERIENCE. THEY HAVE EDUCATION CERTIFICATION, AND IT MEETS OR EXCEEDS THE POSITION REQUIREMENTS AND THE INDUSTRY NORMS. ALL PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERS. WHEN PROFESSIONAL TRAFFIC OPERATIONS ENGINEER, AND ONE Ph.D. WE HAVE EXPERIENCE WORKING IN FIVE DIFFERENT STATES IS. WE HAVEERVED IN TRANSPORTATION LEADERSHIP AND RESEARCH ROLES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. WE HAVE OVER -- OUR TRANSPORTATION PLANNERS HAVE OVER 50 YEARS OF COMBINED EXPERIENCE WORKING 11 DIFFERENT PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SECTOR. AND WE HAVE CERTIFICATION THAT EXCEEDS OR MEETS THE POSITION REQUIREMENTS AND INDUSTRY NORMS AND WE SERVED IN TRANSPORTATION LEADERSHIP AND RESEARCH ROLES ON M.P.O.s AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS. THE NEW POSITION, THE COUNCIL EXPECTATION HAS CHANGED BACK AND FORTH. H.R. IS CURRENTLY RESEARCHING POSITION DESCRIPTIONS FROM OTHER LEADING COMMUNITIES, INCLUDING NEW YORK, BOULDER, MADISON, CHARLOTTESVILLE AND PORTLAND AND OTHERS THAT HAVE BEEN MENTIONED. WITH WE LOOK AT THE IMPROVEMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE, JUST WITHIN THE UPDATE FROM THE LAST MONTH, WE HAVE HAD 101 IN-ROAD CROSSWALK SIGNS AND 37 SIGNS WERE REPLACED. WE HAVE INSTALLED A NEW CROSSWALK AT LIBERTY STREET AND DARTMORE. HAVE NEW RFPs AT NORTH MAPLE OUTSIDE THE PEACE NEIGHBORHOOD CENTER, NEW RFPs AT NORTH MAPLE AND NEW RFPs WERE INSTALLED ON EISENHOWER PARKWAY. AND NEW RFPs WERE INSTALLED, IN ADDITION TO THESE THESE IMPROVEMENTS 26 NEW STREET LIGHTS WERE INSTALLED, 10 CITY LOCATIONS, 11D.T.E. LOCATIONS AND FIVE LOCATIONS AS PART OF OTHER PROJECTS AND D.T.E. HAS SERVICED OVER 382 STREET LIGHT OUTAGES SINCE APRIL 1st. I HARDLY THINK THAT SPEAKS TOWARDING INTENGALLY PUTTING PEOPLE AT RISK WHICH IS -- IT GOES COUNTER TO WHAT PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERS DO. BUT I WOULD REMIND YOU THAT WE HAVE AN EXCEPTIONAL CHIEF ENGINEER, CITY ENGINEER AND MR. M HUTCHINSON. WE HAVE AN EXCEPTIONAL STAFF AND OUR INTENT IS TO USE, AND SEEK EXPERT PER COUNCIL'S DESIRES BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE CURRENT STAFF IS ANYTHING OTHER THAN EXCELLENT.
04:22:35.598: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
04:22:36.566: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. YEAH, I JUST I'M A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED THAT THE PRIOR RESOLUTION WAS POSTPONED WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO MY COLLEAGUE. IF I FELT THE WAY YOU FELT, ABOUT THIS ISSUE, I PROBABLY WOULD NOT HAVE POSTPONED IT. YOU'VE GOT TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE, I GUESS, GRACIOUS IN THE SENSE THAT I DIDN'T REAL THE ACCIDENT REPORT ON THE TEENAGER THAT WAS KILLED IN 2016, BUT I'M NOT SURE AND PLEASE CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG WHETHER LIGHTING WAS THE CAUSE OF -- OF THE -- OF THE DEATH. SO YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WHEN SPEAKING TO THAT. AGAIN, I'M KIND OF PERPLEXED AT WHY THE PRIOR RESOLUTION WAS POSTPONED WHEN THE SENSE OF IMMEDIACY IS HERE AND PROVIDING MORE SAFETY. THIS RESOLUTION TO BE HONEST WITH YOU IS JUST WINDOW DRESSING, AND IT HAS NO MEAT IN, IT NO TEETH IN IT:  YOU KNOW, WE WILL PASS IT. YOU KNOW, SAY WE DID SOMETHING. BUT, IN FACT, THE REALITY IS IT DOESN'T REALLY DO MUCH. IT DIDN'T REALLY MOVE THE NEEDLE. SO SORRY TO BE SO BLUNT BUT IT IS 11:30 AT NIGHT, AND I WILL BE HERE UNTIL 4:00 IN THE MORNING. I DON'T CARE IF IT MEANS PROVIDING MORE SAFETY AND THAT'S WHY I'M JUST DISAPPOINTED THAT THE PRIOR RESOLUTION WAS POSTPONED.
04:24:23.473: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION.
04:24:28.444: >> Councilmember Griswold: THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK AGAIN. THE CRASH IN 2016 PER THE POLICE REPORT, THE MAJOR CONTRIBUTING FACTOR WAS A LACK OF LIGHTING AND THAT IS WHY THE DRIVER WAS NOT CHARGED. THE REASON I POSTPONED THE PREVIOUS RESOLUTION WAS NOT ONLY THE TIME OF THE EVENING, BUT ALSO I WANTED TO WORK MORE CLOSELY WITH THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR TO PUT MORE MEAT IN THAT RESOLUTION. BECAUSE IT DID NOT HAVE THAT. AND MY COMMENTS DO NOT REFLECT ON THE EXISTING STAFF. THEY ADDRESS THE VOID AND WHILE WE DO HAVE A CHIEF ENGINEER, WE DO NOT HAVE A CHIEF ENGINEER OF TRANSPORTATION AS WE DID A DECADE AGO. AND THAT IS WHAT WE NEED. THANK YOU.
04:25:21.097: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? PERHAPS WE CAN MOVE ON ON THIS. I FORGET WHETHER I HEARD OPPOSITION. ROLL CALL VOTE STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER. I'M SORRY, MY APOLOGIES. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? NO. YOU WANT A ROLL CALL ON THAT.
04:25:43.686: >> Councilmember Smith: NO, JUST NOTE THAT I OBJECT.

MOVED BY RAMLAWI, SECONDED BY GGRISWOLD WHAT IS PROPER PROCEDURE OF THIS, IN LIGHT OF THE ZONING BEING DENIED?
04:27:21.584: >> WELL, GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE ZONING IS DENIED, THEN THE APPROPRIATE PROCEDURE WOULD BE -- COUNCIL CAN FIND THAT THE CURRENT SITE PLAN DOESN'T MEET THE CURRENT ZONING. SO DENIAL WOULD BE APPROPRIATE.
04:27:35.031: >> Mayor Taylor: ANY DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? ALL OPPOSED? [CHORUS OF AYES] IT'S REJECTED. DB-2, RESOLUTION TO APPROVE THE GLEN MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT MODIFIED PUD SITE PLAN, 201, 213, 215, 217 GLEN AVENUE AND 1025 EAST ANN STREET, MOVED BY GRAND AND SECONDED BY LUMM. DISCUSSION OF DB-2.

DS-1, RESOLUTION TO PROCEED WITH A ROAD RECONFIGURATION PILOT FOR BRAVERWOOD DRIVE, FROM HURON PARK WAY TO PLYMOUTH ROAD, MOVEDLY LUMM AND SECOND -- MOVED BY LUMM AND SECONDED BY GRAND. DISCUSSION OF DS-1. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
04:28:55.378: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WOULD LIKE SOMEONE FROM STAFF TO COME UP AND TELL US WHERE WE ARE AT WITH THIS AND WHAT WE MAY BE VOTING ON TONIGHT. BECAUSE I WAS SUPPORTIVE OF --
04:29:11.527: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. HESS?
04:29:12.094: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I APPRECIATE THE REQUEST FOR THE PARKING ON THERE.
04:29:15.565: >> SO I BELIEVE MY UNDERSTANDING IS COUNCIL APPROVED THE FIRST CONFIGURATION WITH THE ON-STREET PARKING AND WE WERE DIRECTED TO BRING FORTH AN ALTERNATE DESIGN CONCEPT AT A SUBSEQUENT MEETING, WHICH WE THEN DISCUSSED AT THE LAST MEETING, WHICH WAS THEN POSTPONED TO TODAY. SO I'M NOT EXACTLY CERTAIN WHAT THE MOTION WOULD HAVE TO BE. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT -- YOU KNOW, I MIGHT DEFER TO THE CITY CLERK OR THE MAYOR ON THAT, BUT -- SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THERE IS -- THE ORIGINAL TRAVERWOOD RESOLUTION IS APPROVED.
04:29:51.334: >> Mayor Taylor: THE ORIGINAL TRAVERWOOD RESOLUTION WAS APPROVED AND THEN RECONSIDERED AND THEN POSTPONED.
04:29:56.772: >> Councilmember Grand: SO WE NEED TO VOTE --
04:29:58.541: >> Mayor Taylor: SO WHAT I HEAR YOU SAYING WHAT WE HAVE BEFORE US IS THE ORIGINAL TRAVERWOOD PROPOSAL? THAT'S CORRECT. I'M HEARING THAT THAT'S CORRECT FROM THE CLERK. THE ORIGINAL TRAVERWOOD PROPOSAL IS BEFORE US. IS THAT -- IS THAT INCONSISTENT WITH OUR UNDERSTANDING?
04:30:17.693: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES.
04:30:19.262: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. McDONALD, CAN YOU HELP WITH THIS?
04:30:23.165: >> SO IN -- IN THE CONFIGURATION -- I CAN SPEAK TO THE CONFIGURATION, THE ORIGINAL CONFIGURATION WAS A BIKE LANE ON EAST SIDE OF THE ROAD, GOING UP THE HILL, NORTHBOUND, WITH ON STREET PARKING ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE ROAD GOING SOUTHBOUND. SO THAT WAS -- [ NO AUDIO ] THAT WAS THE ON-STREET PARKING, ESPECIALLY RELATED TO THE IMPACTS OF SOME OF THE ADJACENT USERS ALONG THAT CORRIDOR AND THAT'S WHAT WE ARE ASKED TO KIND OF PROVIDE.
04:30:54.931: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. RAMLAWI.
04:30:55.565: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  SO THIS BEFORE US, IF WE VOTED YES, WOULD PUT BIKE LANES ON BOWE SIDES OF TRAVERWOOD.
04:31:05.541: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES, THAT'S WHAT'S IN THIS PACKET.
04:31:09.612: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  IF WE VOTED YES ON THIS WE WOULD BE PUTTING BIKE LANES ON BOTH SIDES OF TRAVERWOOD. WHAT WAS PASSED ORIGINALLY HAD ON STREET PARKING ON ONE SIDE.
04:31:21.157: >> Councilmember Lumm: THAT'S CORRECT.
04:31:22.792: >> THAT'S CORRECT.
04:31:23.259: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  AND THAT IS WHAT IS STILL HOLDING IF NOTHING GETS -- IF NO ACTION IS TAKEN.
04:31:32.234: >> Councilmember Lumm: THAT'S CORRECT.
04:31:33.102: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THIS WOULD CHANGE THAT ORIGINAL ACTION, AND THIS WOULD PROVIDE BIKE LANES ON BOTH SIDES. I JUST WANT TO MAKE THAT CLEAR TO THIS BODY.
04:31:43.813: >> Councilmember Lumm: YEAH.
04:31:46.382: >> Councilmember Grand: THAT'S NOT -- CAN WE LISTEN TO OUR CLERK, PLEASE WHO CAN ACTUALLY LET US KNOW.
04:31:50.319: >> Councilmember Lumm: READ WHAT'S IN THE PACKET. THAT'S WHAT'S IN THE PACKET.
04:31:55.057: >> Councilmember Grand: BUT --
04:31:55.691: >> Councilmember Lumm: JUST READ THE PACKET. IT'S THE ROAD DIET WITHOUT THE ADDED PARKING. THE BIKE LANES ON BOTH SIDES. THAT'S WHAT'S IN THE PACKET.
04:32:07.236: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. HESS.
04:32:07.803: >> LAST MONTH -- OR AT THE LAST MEETING, THAT'S WHAT WAS PRESENTED. THAT ITEM, I THINK, JUST CARRIED FORWARD FROM LAST MONTH TO THIS MONTH. SO THAT BACKUP, THAT'S THE AGENDA ITEM THAT WE WERED TO RECONSIDER OR BRING FORTH THE DESIGN FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION?
04:32:25.087: >> Mayor Taylor: LET ME SUGGEST THIS, NO MATTER WHAT WE HAVE BEFORE US, PERHAPS WE AMEND SO THAT IT PRESENTS THE ORIGINAL RESOLUTION. AND THAT WAY WHETHER IT'S A REDUNDANT AMENDMENT OR AN EFFECTIVE AMENDMENT SO BE IT. THERE'S A --
04:32:39.969: >> Councilmember Eaton: WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THE ORIGINAL?
04:32:43.606: >> Mayor Taylor: THE ORIGINAL RESOLUTION FOR A BIKE LANE ON ONE SIDE AND PARKING ON THE OTHER, AND WHAT IS THE ISLAMIC CENTER IS LOOKING FOR.
04:32:53.182: >> Councilmember Eaton: AND WHAT DID WE VOTE ON?
04:32:54.784: >> Mayor Taylor: JUST TO MAKE CLEAR -- BUT THEN THAT WAS -- THAT WAS THE ORIGINAL VOTE. THEN THAT WAS RECONSIDERED, WHICH ESSENTIALLY NULLIFIES THAT APPROVAL. SO THE APPROVAL HAS BEEN NULLIFIED. RIGHT NOW THERE'S NO ROAD CONFIGURATION PLAND. SPECIAL PLAN FOR TRAVERWOOD. WE WISH TO IMPLEMENT ONE AND I GUESS MY SUGGESTION WOULD BE -- AND I'M LOOKING TO STAFF TO TELL ME THAT THIS IS WRONG OR RIGHT AND COUNCILMEMBERS AS WELL, IS THAT WHATEVER IT SAYS, THERE'S SOME CONFUSION. WHATEVER IT SAYS, WE AMEND IT SO THAT IT PROVIDES FOR WANT OF A BETTER WORD, THE ORIGINAL PLAN. AND THAT WE THEN VOTE THAT ONE UP OR DOWN.
04:33:32.021: >> Councilmember Grand: I MOVE THAT. I MOVE THE ORIGINAL PLAN.
04:33:36.459: >> Councilmember Lumm: CAN I FIRST --
04:33:37.960: >> Mayor Taylor: CAN WE GET -- LET'S HAVE COUNCILMEMBER LUMM'S QUESTION AND THEN WE'LL GO BACK TO --
04:33:43.833: >> Councilmember Lumm: I DON'T REALLY HAVE A QUESTION WILL. I APPRECIATE THAT COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI -- CAN I FINISH? THIS IS MY ONE TIME. I HAD MY HAND UP. AND HE'S CORRECT THAT THE VERSION IN THE PACKET, JUST TO CLARIFY, AND CONFIRM BECAUSE I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT THAT EVERYONE REALIZE THIS, IS THE TRAVERWOOD ROAD DIET WITHOUT ADDED PARKING. THE BIKE LANES ARE STILL ON BOTH SIDES OF THE STREET. WHEN WE -- ON AUGUST 5th, WE PASSED IT WITH THE ON-STREET PARKING. AND THEN ON AUGUST 19th, WE BROUGHT IT BACK FOR RECONSIDERATION. COUNCILMEMBER NELSON, I BELIEVE, HAD ASKED TO CONSIDER THE ALTERNATIVE WITHOUT PARKING. IT WAS POSTPONED. AND THEN ON SEPTEMBER 3rd, IT WAS POSTPONED AGAIN. ON SEPTEMBER 3rd, AND WHEN WE REQUESTED -- MADE THAT REQUEST, WE DIRECTED STAFF TO GO BACK AND TALK TO THE STAKEHOLDERS ABOUT THEIR PARKING PREFERENCES. AND THE ONLY FEEDBACK WE REALLY RECEIVED WAS LETTERS FROM THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY OF ANN ARBOR AND THEY INDICATED AND SOMEONE CAN CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG ADDED SUPPORT ADDING THE PARKING WITH THE THREE-HOUR LIMIT. BUT, AGAIN, THAT'S NOT THE VERSION WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US. SO --
04:35:13.589: >> Mayor Taylor: WHAT --
04:35:14.156: >> Councilmember Lumm: WHAT WE NEED IS THE VERSION THAT WE HAD PASSED, FRANKLY ON AUGUST 5th.
04:35:22.064: >> Mayor Taylor: WOULD OUR CLERK PLEASE OPINE AS TO WHAT -- WELL, WOULD OUR CLERK PLEASE EXPLAIN THE NATURE OF THE PACKET AND OUABAIN AS TO WHICH AMENDMENT -- WHICH PROPOSAL IS BEFORE US?
04:35:33.943: >> Councilmember Lumm: IT IS A.
04:35:39.081: >> Mayor Taylor: MS. BEAUDRY.
04:35:39.715: >> Clerk Beaudry: SO THE RESOLUTION WAS ORIGINALLY APPROVED ON AUGUST 5th AND IT WAS RECONSIDERED ON AUGUST 19th. AND ON AUGUST 19th. IT WAS POSTPONED AND STAFF WAS ASKED TO PRESENT ALTERNATIVE PLANS FOR THE ROAD RECONFIGURATION. A NEW ATTACHMENT WAS ADDED FOR CONSIDERATION AND THEN THE EXISTING RESOLUTION WAS AGAIN FURTHER POSTPONED UNTIL SEPTEMBER 3rd AND, AGAIN, TO SEPTEMBER 16. SO ALL OF THE PROPOSALS ARE INCLUDED AS ATTACHMENTS, BUT IT'S NEVER BEEN AMENDED TO CHANGE IT TO THE LAST ATTACHMENT THAT WAS ADDED. ALL THAT'S BEEN DONE IS RECONSIDER THE ORIGINAL AND THEN POSTPONED MULTIPLE TIMES.
04:36:30.232: >> Mayor Taylor: SO TO RESTATE, WE HAVE BEFORE US TODAY THE ORIGINAL PROPOSAL, WHICH WAS ORIGINALLY APPROVED IN ADDITION TO ATTACHMENTS WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN -- WHICH HAVE BEEN INCLUDED FOR OUR INFORMATION AND BENEFIT IN THE EVENT THAT SOMEONE WISHED TO INCLUDE THEM, BUT WHICH ARE NOT FORMALLY PART OF THE RESOLUTION BEFORE US ; IS THAT CORRECT?
04:36:56.392: >> THAT IS CORRECT.
04:36:57.693: >> Mayor Taylor: OKAY. SO WE HAVE BEFORE US THE SAME RESOLUTION WHICH WAS PASSED BACK ON AUGUST 5th. THE RESOLUTION WHICH PROVIDES FOR ONE BIKE LANE, AND ONE PARKING LANE.
04:37:09.271: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU, MR. MAYOR, BUT FOR THE FACT THAT THE SECOND TO LAST WHEREAS CLAUSE SAYS ONE NORTHBOUND AND ONE SOUTHBOUND, AND IT'S DATED 9/5.
04:37:22.685: >> Councilmember Lumm: RIGHT.
04:37:23.319: >> Councilmember Hayner: WHICH IS EN SEPTEMBER 5th, NOT AUGUST 5th. I THINK THAT'S WHERE COUNCIL RAMLAWI GOT HIS INFO FROM.
04:37:37.633: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES.
04:37:38.734: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. HESS?
04:37:39.301: >> WE DON'T KNOW WHAT RESOLUTION.
04:37:42.571: >> Mayor Taylor: YOU ARE SAYING IT'S THERE FOR INFORMATION?
04:37:45.207: >> RIGHT, I THINK THE RESOLUTION THAT'S HERE BEFORE YOU TODAY IS THE RESOLUTION THAT WAS BROUGHT YOU TO LAST TIME AND THEN THE INFORMATION THAT WE WERED TO BRING BACK TO YOU IS WHAT HAVE YOU HEARD FROM AFFECTED STAKEHOLDERS. THIS WAS THE EMAIL THAT WAS PROVIDED BUT WE NEVER WERE GIVEN DIRECTION TO CHANGE IT BACK. IT WAS GIVE US INPUT FROM WHAT YOU HEARD FROM THOSE STAKEHOLDERS. SO WE DIDN'T REVERT ANYTHING BACK TO THE ORIGINAL BECAUSE I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT TO BE OUR DIRECTION.
04:38:11.133: >> Councilmember Lumm: RIGHT. SO IT NEEDS TO BE AMENDED.
04:38:16.271: >> Mayor Taylor: SO THE ATTACHMENT REMAINS AS OLD BUT THE RESOLUTION INCLUDES A STRAY WHEREAS CLAUSE IS THAT PRETTY MUCH WHAT I'M HEARING? SO IN OTHER WORDS, THE PROPOSED PILOT ROAD CONFIGURATION IN RESOLVE CLAUSE NUMBER ONE IS THE OLD PROPOSAL. THERE MAY BE STRAY AND INACCURATE WHEREAS CLAUSES BUT THE RESOLVE CLAUSE IS CORRECT. I'M LOOKING FOR STAFF FOR CONFATHER-IN-LAWATION.
04:38:52.041: >> City Admin. Lazarus: MAYOR, IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL TO CHANGE THE RESOLVE CLAUSE AND SAY THE CITY COUNCIL ADOPTS THE INITIALLY PROPOSED PILOT CONFIGURATION PILOT WHICH CONSISTS OF ONE, TWO TRAVEL LANES, I BIKE LANE ON THE UPHILL SIDE AND PARKING ON THE ■DOWNHIL SIDE AND SHARED LANE PARKINGS ON THE DOWNHILL SIDE.
04:39:13.595: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THAT ACCEPTABLE?
04:39:15.898: >> City Admin. Lazarus: AND YOU CAN ADD --
04:39:17.166: >> Councilmember Lumm: SOMEONE NEEDS TO MOVE THAT.
04:39:18.634: >> Mayor Taylor: SOMEONE MOVE THAT? MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, AND SECONDED BY LUMM. IS THAT FRIENDLY TO THE BODY.
04:39:26.608: >> YES.
04:39:27.009: >> Mayor Taylor: IT'S FRIENDLY TO THE BODY. DOES EVERYBODY FEEL SATISFIED AS TO THE CONTENT OF THE --
04:39:30.312: >> Councilmember Hayner:  AND WE WILL HAVE THIS --
04:39:31.747: >> Councilmember Lumm: SO AS BACK TO THE ORIGINAL?
04:39:33.549: >> Councilmember Hayner:  BUT WE WILL HAVE IT REWRITTEN IN SOME MANNER BEFORE PUBLICATION.
04:39:38.520: >> Mayor Taylor: YES, YES, THAT'S ON THE TAPE AND WILL BE BROUGHT IN. SO THE RESOLUTION IS, I BELIEVE, NOW FIRMLY ESTABLISHED AS THE OLD RESOLUTION.
04:39:48.997: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  THE ORIGINAL.
04:39:52.234: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION ABOUT THE OLD RESOLUTION?
04:39:57.773: >> Councilmember Griswold:  MY PRIMARY GOAL IS TO PROVIDE PARKING FOR THE ISLAMIC CENTER, AND SO I'M WONDERING HOW -- HOW WE WILL ACHIEVE THAT WITH THREE-HOUR PARKING GIVEN THAT THERE'S USUALLY THE NEED FOR PARKING EXCEEDS THE SUPPLY IN THAT AREA. SO IS THERE SOME WAY THAT THAT WE WILL ASSIGN IT FOR FRIDAYS OR HOW WILL WE PROVIDE PARKING FOR THE ISLAMIC CENTER?
04:40:30.239: >> RIGHT. SO WE CAN'T -- AS IS THE CASE FOR ANY OF OUR PUBLIC PARKING, THERE AREN'T ANY ASSIGNMENTS PER SE. WE CAN PUT TIME RESTRICTIONS ON THEM PUT LUCK LICK PARKING IS PUBLIC PARKING AND FOR PUBLIC USE. I BELIEVE THE LETTER THAT YOU SAW FROM THE ISLAMIC CENTER INDICATES A PREFERENCE FOR THREE-HOUR. THAT COINCIDES WITH THEIR SERVICES, YOU KNOW, THE SCHOOL DROP OFF AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE NOT YET SOLVED FOR YET IS IF THE THREE HOURS IS ACCEPTABLE TO THE STAKEHOLDERS ALONG THAT CORRIDOR, WE HAVEN'T YET DETERMINED WHICH DAYS OF THE WEEK IT WOULD TAKE EFFECT. YOU KNOW, WE -- THERE ARE TRADEOFFS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS, THAT IF THERE'S ON-STREET PARKING THROUGH MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY, IT PROVIDES, YOU KNOW, IF IT'S ALL DAY OR MORE THAN THREE HOURS, IT PROVIDES A POTENTIAL USER GROUP THAT MAY INCLUDE OTHERS ASIDE FROM THE ISLAMIC CENTER. IF WE LIMIT IT TO THREE HOURS, THEN IT LIMITS IT TO MORE RAPID TURNOVER. SO THAT'S ONE OF THE THING THAT WE STILL HAVEN'T SOLVED FOR YET. WE ARE STILL WAITING TO HEAR FROM COUNCIL IN TERMS OF WHICH OF THE OPTIONS THEY DIRECT US TO PURSUE AND THEN WE WOULD FOLLOW UP ACCORDINGLY.
04:41:53.088: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD YOU STILL HAVE THE FLOOR. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
04:41:56.758: >> Councilmember Hayner:  IT'S EASY TO ARE ME TO SUPPORT IT IN THE ORIGINAL FORM BECAUSE I VOTED FOR IT BACK THEN. I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT I ALSO DID SUPPORT BRINGING THESE THINGS BACK BEFORE COUNCIL, AND I'M HOPING TO NOT REGRET IT MOVING FORWARD.
04:42:12.241: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
04:42:14.710: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. APPRECIATE IT. YES I REALLY DO THING WE NEED TO THINK SPACE WHEN WE BRING THINGS BACK FOR RECONSIDERATION. WE HAVE SPENT AN AWFUL LOT OF TIME ON THIS AN AWFUL LOT OF STAFF TIME ON THIS AND WHILE WE SIT THERE AND LOOK AT HOW WE SPEND MONEY, I'M LOOKING AT PEOPLE THAT GET PAID A LOT OF MONEY TO BE IN THESE MEETINGS AND DO THIS WORK. SO FOLKS, PENNYWISE POUND FOOL IS WHAT I SEE. AND, YOU KNOW, THESE OPTIONS ARE ACTUALLY -- THEY WERE ALL LAID OUT IN THE ORIGINAL PACKET THAT WE GOT ON AUGUST 5th. STAFF DID PROVIDE US WITH ALL OF THESE SAME DIFFERENT CONFIGURATIONS IF YOU GO BACK AND LOOK AT THAT AGENDA, WITH BIKE LANES ON BOTH SIDES AND ON STREET PARKING AND THEY GAVE US MULTIPLE OPTIONS AT THAT MEETING TO REVIEW AND DISCUSS AND VOTE REMINDING MY COLLEAGUES THAT THE INFORMATION WAS THERE, AND I BELIEVE WE WASTED A LOT OF TIME, HENCE MONEY.
04:43:14.770: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED?
04:43:21.009: >> Councilmember Griswold: OPPOSED.
04:43:23.278: >> OPPOSED.
04:43:23.845: >> Mayor Taylor: SORRY.
04:43:24.546: >> Councilmember Lumm: LET'S DO ROLL CALL.
04:43:26.048: >> Mayor Taylor: ROLL CALL VOTE STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
04:43:28.417: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES.
04:43:31.286: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES.
04:43:35.757: >> Councilmember Griswold: NO.
04:43:39.961: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES.
04:43:42.064: >> Councilmember Grand: YES.
04:43:42.664: >> Clerk Beaudry: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN AB SENT.
04:43:43.799: >> Mayor Taylor: NO.
04:43:44.266: >> Councilmember Nelson:  YES.
04:43:46.902: >> Councilmember Smith: YES.
04:43:47.502: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES.
04:43:50.605: >> Clerk Beaudry: THE MOTION CARRIES.
04:43:51.873: >> Mayor Taylor: DO WE HAVE COMMUNICATIONS FROM OUR CITY ATTORNEY?
04:43:55.977: >> City Atty. Postema: NO.
04:43:58.280: >> Mayor Taylor: WE HAVE US THE CLERK'S REPORT. MAY I HAVE APPROVAL. MOVED BY LUMM AND HAYNER. DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? AND NOW WE COULD. TPUBLIC COMMENT RESERVE TIME, OE NEED NOT HAVE SIGNED UP IN ADVANCE. SPEAKERS HAVE THREE MINUTES IN WHICH TO SPEAK. PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE TIME CLOCK AND AS A MATTER OF THE COURTESY, WE MAY ONLY HAVE ONE PERSON SPEAK AT A TIME AND IF YOU REQUIRE ASSISTANCE IN SPEAKING BEFORE COUNCIL. IS THERE ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT?
04:44:37.018: >> HI, MY NAME IS EDWARD I WILL VILAMETTI. I TALKED ABOUT THE SAFE ROADS TO THE SCHOOLS AN I PROMISED A FIELD REPORT AND I WOULD DO THAT RIGHT NOW, JUST BRIEFLY. THIS IS AS MUCH FOR ME TO RELATE SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT CROSS INSTITUTIONAL AND/OR ORGANIZATIONAL BOUNDARIES, SOME HAVING TO DO THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AND SOME HAVING TO DO WITH THE ANN ARBOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND THE VARIOUS ONES THAT WITHIN THE PURVIEW OF THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR ALSO INCLUDE THE PUBLIC ART COMMISSION. SO THERE'S A WHOLE BASKET OF PEOPLE WHO MIGHT NEED TO GET INVOLVED IN THIS. I WILL SAY THAT I HAD A BRIEF CONVERSATION WITH LIZ MARGOLIS FROM THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS WHO IS THE SAFE ROUTES SCHOOL COORDINATOR AND I EXPECT TO PRIMARILY WORK WITH HER GOING FORWARD AND IF ANYTHING, THESE ARE JUST MY NOTES FOR THAT. SO THE ROUTE THAT I TOOK WAS UP AND OVER THE STADIUM BRIDGES TO PIONEER HIGH SCHOOL, WHICH SHOULD BE VERY EASY. IT SHOULD BE EASY BECAUSE THE BRIDGE WAS EXTENSIVELY RECONSTRUCTED VERY RECENTLY. IT SHOULD BE EASY BECAUSE THERE ARE POTENTIALLY A LOT OF HIGH SCHOOL-AGED STUDENTS WHO COULD RIDE THEIR BICYCLE TO SCHOOL RATHER THAN RIDE THEIR -- DRIVE THEIR VEHICLE OR GET DRIVEN. BUT THAT SAID, THERE ARE SOME LIMITS TO THOSE SAFE ROUTES AND IN PARTICULAR, I WILL FLAG ONE OF THEM THAT IS THE UNIVERSITIES WHICH IS KIPKEY DRIVE, A VERY WIDEWAY. VERY AWKWARD BICYCLE ROUTE THROUGH THAT. VERY AWKWARD PEDESTRIAN ROUTE AND I SPOKE WITH SOMEONE WHOSE CHILD HAD GOTTEN HIT ON THAT CORNER, HIT BY UNIVERSITY PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICER. SO THERE'S CONCERNS AT THAT SPOT AND I PREFER IT AND I THINK MY SON HAS PREFERRED NOT TO USE THAT INTERSECTION. THERE'S SOME WORK GOING ON RIGHT THERE, RIGHT NOW FOR RESTRIPING SOME THINGS BUT THE CONCRETE IS NOT THE -- THE CONCRETE IS THE ISSUE AND THE STRIPES ARE NOT THE ISSUE. ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROAD IS SOMETHING SQUARELY WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE CITY, WHICH IS THE PUBLIC ART INSTALLATION ON THE STADIUM BRIDGE, NOT THE GLASS PANELS THAT ARE WELL BACK FROM THE SIDEWALK BUT THE METAL SORT OF FISH SCALE SCULPTURES ON THE -- ON THE ANN ARBOR SIDE. I HAVE TO SAY IT'S A VERY SHARP INSTALLATION. IF YOU WALK UP TO IT, AND YOU HIT IT, YOU DON'T CUT YOURSELF, BUT YOU FEEL THAT THERE'S AN EDGE THERE. THE SIDEWALK THERE IS QUITE NARROW. IT'S PROBABLY TOO NARROW FOR TWO BICYCLE AT HIGH SPED TO GO PAST EACH OTHER. I WOULDN'T WANT TO TEST IT AND I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT SOME REMEDIAL ACTION BE TAKEN THERE. THANK YOU.
04:47:34.396: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT. SEEING NO ONE, PUBLIC COMMENT IS CLOSED DO WE HAVE COMMUNICATION FROM COUNCIL? COUNCICOUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
04:47:49.377: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE D.D.A. DIRECTOR, SUSAN PALAY. WE WALKED AROUND THE DOWNTOWN HEAR LAST FRIDAY AND IDENTIFIED MANY STUDENT -- AREA LAST FRIDAY AND IDENTIFIED MANY OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE THE WALKABILITY OF THE DOWNTOWN AREA.
04:48:07.696: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER COMMUNICATION FROM COUNCIL? DO WE HAVE A CLOSED SESSION TODAY?
04:48:11.433: >> City Atty. Postema: WE DO HAVE A CLOSED UNDER THE OPEN MEETINGS ACT TO DISCUSS PENDING LITIGATION, SPECIFICALLY THE PETERS BUILDING COMPANY -- COMPANY, THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR, WHICH IS A WASHTENAW COUNTY CASE.
04:48:24.746: >> Mayor Taylor: MAY I HAVE A MOTION TO GO INTO CLOSED SESSION. MOVED BY LUMM, SECONDED BY GRISWOLD FOR THE PURPOSES AFOREMENTIONED. DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
