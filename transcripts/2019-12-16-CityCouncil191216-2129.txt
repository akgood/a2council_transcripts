00:02:45.029: >> CITY ADMIN. LAZARUS:  WE DO, MAYOR. THIS IS THE LAST MEETING FOR THE YEAR, SO I WANT TO WISH EVERYONE THE BEST FOR THE HOLIDAYS. IT'S BEEN A LONG FRUITFUL YEAR, AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN TIME TO REFLECT ON THE MANY ACCOMPLISHMENTS.  I WANT TO RECOGNIZE MEMBERS OF OUR PARKS AND RECREATION TEAM, PARTICULARLY HILLARY, CHERYL AND COLLIN, IN THAT WE RECEIVED A $300,000 UNIVERSAL ACCESS GRANT AND SITE IMPROVEMENTS AWARD FROM THE DNR TO IMPROVE ACCESSIBILITY AT THE ARGO BOAT LIVERY. I WOULD ALSO ADVISE EVERYONE THAT MUNICIPAL OFFICES ARE CLOSED DECEMBER 24TH AND 25th AND DECEMBER 31ST AND JANUARY 1ST. THE CLOSING DATE FOR PEOPLE INTERESTED IN THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE A POLICE SERVICE SPECIALIST CADET CLOSES ON DECEMBER 22ND AS WELL. AND WITH THAT, I WANTO ASK THE INDULGENCE TO HAVE SHERRY COME UP AND INTRODUCE SOME DISTINGUISHED GUESTS THIS EVENING. SHE IS ONE OF OUR HR SERVICE REPS AND ALSO DOUBLES AS OUR DIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION OFFICER.
00:03:59.002: >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MAYOR AND COUNCILMEMBERS. I AM VERY PLEASED TO INTRODUCE SDS GLOBAL ENTERPRISES, WHO IS OUR DIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION CONSULTANTS THAT WILL BE HELPING US OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT YEAR AND TWO YEARS TO DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE DIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION PLAN. THIS IS DR. SHIRLEY DAVIS, AND I'LL LET YOU INTRODUCE YOUR STAFF.
00:04:22.359: >> SURE. IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE, AND IT'S AN HONOR TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH YOU TO BUILD A MORE INCLUSIVE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. I AM THRILLED TO INTRODUCE CAPTAIN FITZPATRICK, WHO HAS BEEN WORKING WITH SDS GLOBAL FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS, AND ALSO CINDY RAMIREZ RYAN WHO HAS BEEN WITH THE ORGANIZATION FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS. BOTH OF THEM HAVE VERY EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN HUMAN RESOURCES. CAPTAIN FITZPATRICK IS A RETIRED CAPTAIN WITH THE LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES. CINDY AND I HAVE MORE THAN 30 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN HUMAN RESOURCES AND TALENT MANAGEMENT. WE HOPE TO WORK TOGETHER TO HELP BRING THE CITY BECOME MORE DIVERSE AND INCLUSIVE.
00:05:11.508: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU. THANKS FOR COMING. I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU.
00:05:18.315: >> CITY ADMIN. LAZARUS: FINALLY, I WOULD LIKE TO RECOGNIZE THE OFFICER IN THE BACK THERE FOR PROVIDING HELP THIS EVENING.
00:05:25.355: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  WE NOW COME TO PUBLIC COMMENT RESERVE TIME, AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY TO SPEAK TO COUNCIL ABOUT MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST. ONE NEEDS TO HAVE SIGNED UP IN ADVANCE BY CONTACTING OUR CITY CLERK. SPEAKERS HAVE THREE MINUTES IN WHICH TO SPEAK, SO PLEASE PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE TIME CLOCK. AS A MATTER OF COURTESY, WE MAY ONLY HAVE ONE PERSON SPEAKING AT A TIME, AND FINALLY, IF YOU REQUIRE ASSISTANCE TO SPEAK TO COUNCIL TODAY, WE WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO PROVIDE IT TO YOU.
00:05:59.656: >> I AM BRIAN CHAMBERS FROM THE 3rd WARD AND WAS APPOINTED BY THE MAYOR TO THE CONTRACTORS SELECTION COMMITTEE FOR THE COMMUNITY VISION AND MASTER LAND USE UPDATE. FIRST AND FOREMOST, I WANT TO STATE MY APPRECIATION FOR THE OPPORTUNITY THAT THE MAYOR AND COUNCIL BOTH PROVIDED ME AND OTHERS ON THE COUNCIL-APPOINTED TEAM. PERSONALLY, I BELIEVE THE PLANNING PROCESS BY THE CITY MANAGER WAS CLEARLY FRAMED WITH CRITERIA AND A DECISION-MAKING APPROACH. THE CITY DESERVES GREAT CREDIT. I BELIEVE THAT INTERFACE IS THE BEST AND RIGHT FIT FOR THE CITY. THERE WERE NO OBJECTIONS TO THEM OR ANYONE STATING THEY WOULD NOT WORK WITH THEM ON THE PROJECT. THIS ITSELF IS A FORM OF CONSENSUS AND SPEAKS WELL FOR THE CITY'S R.F.P. AND SELECTION PROCESS. THE APPOINTEE TEAM CONTINUED TO MEET AND HAMMER OUT RECOMMENDATIONS TO BRING TO THE CITY AND COUNCIL BASED ON BEST PRACTICES AND HENCE DELIVER VALUE TO THE CITY. WE KNEW THE PROPOSED CONTRACT WOULD BE TO COUNCIL ON THE 16th. WE WANTED TO TAKE OUR TIME, RATHER THAN RUSH A WATERED DOWN VERSION. TONIGHT, I ONLY SPEAK FOR MYSELF TO CONVEY MY INTENT FOR FORGING AN AGREED LIST OF RECOMMENDATIONS. FIRST AND FOREMOST IS DEMONSTRATING -- EXCUSE ME -- THAT AGREEMENT IS POSSIBLE ACROSS THESE COMPLEX TOPICS. THIS IS NOT EASY, GIVEN THE CURRENT POLITICAL CLIMATE, EVEN HERE IN ANN ARBOR. SECOND FOR ME ARE THE RECOMMENDATIONS CALLING FOR ALIGNMENT WITH RELATED CITY INITIATIVES ON CLIMATE, AFFORDABLE HOUSING, TRANSPORTATION, FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT, AMONG OTHERS. WE WANT ASSURANCES THAT THESE WILL BE INTEGRATED EFFORTS. THIRD IS TO INSTILL THE PROJECT A COMMITMENT TO EQUITY. THIS EMPHASIS WAS MADE IN OUR RECOMMENDATIONS ON OUTREACH AND PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT, STEERING COMMITTEE STRUCTURE, COMMUNICATION PLAN, STATISTICAL SAMPLING METHODOLOGY, AND VALUE MODEL FRAMEWORK OVERALL. EQUITY IS CRITICAL. 40% OF ANN ARBORITES SPEND MORE THAN 30% OF THEIR INCOME ON HOUSING. FAMILIES BELOW THE AREA MEDIAN INCOME OFTEN CANNOT AFFORD NEW CONSTRUCTION, AND WHILE 70% OF RESIDENTS HAVE A FOUR-YEAR DEGREE OR MORE, IT IS ONLY 55% OF 20 AND 30-YEAR-OLDS. SOMETHING IS A MISS. AS A RESULT OF ALL OF THESE ECONOMIC FACTORS, ANN ARBOR IS THE MOST ECONOMICALLY SEGREGATED IN THE MIDWEST. FOURTH IS THE MISSING MIDDLE, BOTH IN HOUSING STRUCTURES AND ECONOMIC BRACKETS. THIS CAN BE ADDRESSED BY INCORPORATING UNION MEMBERS AND REPRESENTATIVES OF THE MISSING MIDDLE. POLICE, FIRE, TEACHERS, UNIVERSITY FACULTY AND STAFF, HOSPITAL STAFF AND THE TRADES, AND ORGANIZATIONS FOCUSED ON INTEGRATION INTO THE PROCESS AND ESPECIALLY ON THE STEERING COMMITTEE. WHO GETS A SEAT AT THE TABLE -- I HAVE TEN MORE SECONDS -- AND WITH WHAT DECISION-MAKING BREADTH DETERMINES SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT CAN BE WHAT EMERGES FOR ANN ARBOR. A POTENTIAL SLOGAN FOR THE PROJECT COULD BE WON'T YOU BE MY NEIGHBOR. IT'S INVITING TO OTHERS AND APPLIES TO HOMEOWNERS, RENTERS, BUSINESSES, AND THOSE WHO CHOOSE TO LIVE IN HIGH RISE STRUCTURES. THANK YOU, MAYOR AND COUNCIL.
00:09:19.089: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS JULIE RITTER.
00:09:33.103: >> HELLO, EVERYONE. JULIE RITTER, 920 KATHARINE. THANK YOU CITY COUNCIL AND PLANNING FOR TRYING SOMETHING NEW AND INCLUDING EVERYDAY CITIZENS OF ANN ARBOR IN THE FORMAL PLANNING PROCESS. IT HAS BEEN QUITE AN EXPERIENCE, AND THE WARD REPS AND APPOINTEES ENDED UP AS A SOLID GROUP WITH RESPECT FOR ONE ANOTHER. KEEP DOING THIS AGAIN. BASED ON EVERYTHING I KNOW ABOUT THE CITY, WE DO NEED AN OUTSIDE CONSULTANT TO RUN THE MASTER PLANNING PROCESS. IT'S A COMPLICATED PROJECT WITH MANY MOVING PARTS, SOME STILL IN CONFLICT, SOME STILL BEING DEFINED, AND MOST OF THEM POLITICALLY COMPLICATED. THE CITY WILL HAVE TO PARTNER WITH A CONSULTANT IN MANY WAYS THAT WILL BE DEMANDING OF STAFF AND CITIZENS. INTERFACE IS AN EXCELLENT CONSULTANCY. THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO CARRY OUT A THOROUGH, BALANCED PLANNING PROCESS FREE OF BIAS. THEY DON'T HAVE A DOG IN THIS FIGHT, BUT THE CURRENT VERSIONS OF THE WORK PLAN AND PROJECT DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TRUST AND COMMUNITY BUILDING FOR A PLAN FACING THE MANY CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE. LISTENING TO AN NPR MAN ON THE STREET INTERVIEW IN PARIS THIS WEEKEND ABOUT THE STRIKES AND PROTEST MARCHES, THE DROLL RESPONSE WAS REFORM AND CHANGE ARE GREAT AS LONG AS YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING DIFFERENTLY YOURSELF. HOW DO WE TAKE THE MASSIVE CHANGES HEADING OUR WAY AND SHAPE A PLAN IN RESPONSE? HOW DO WE PLAN FOR THINGS WE DON'T KNOW? ANN ARBOR IS GOING TO HAVE TO REFORM ITSELF IN THE FACE OF CLIMATE CRISIS, INEQUITY ISSUES, HOUSING AFFORDABILITY AND TRANSPORTATION CHOICES, AMONG MANY OTHER TOPICS. EVERYONE IS GOING TO HAVE TO CHANGE. TO BE SUCCESSFUL, THE PLAN IN THE CITY NEEDS TO WIN THE TRUST OF EVERYONE, AND TRUST IS GAINED THROUGH DEMONSTRATING TRUSTWORTHY BEHAVIOR. THIS STARTS WITH CONNECTION AND INCLUSION. WHEN PEOPLE ARE EXCLUDED FROM MY PROCESS, THEY LOSE TRUST. FOR A RELIABLE PATH FORWARD, THIS PLAN NEEDS INPUT FROM AS WIDE A SWATH OF CITIZENS AS POSSIBLE AND ADVICE FROM EXPERTS WHEREVER THEY MAY BE. THIS IS WHY OUR RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDE BROAD PUBLIC OUTREACH, ROBUST ENGAGEMENT, A LARGE NUMBER OF ADVISORY COMMITTEES AND TARGET GROUPS, AND A STEERING COMMITTEE OF 18-20 PEOPLE REPRESENTING A BROAD DEMOGRAPHIC OF ANN ARBOR. EVERYONE IN THE CITY IS ENTITLED TO HAVE A VOICE IN THE PLAN FOR ITS FUTURE. EVERY COMMENT WILL INFORM THE PROCESS AND BE TRACEABLE. THE INTENTION IS ALL WHO DESIRE TO CONTRIBUTE WILL BE WELCOMED AND HEARD. THE INTENTION PLAYS OUT IN DIFFERENT WAYS IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE WORK PLAN, BY VALUING DIVERSITY, INCLUSION, TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY, AMONG MANY OTHER ON A LONG LIST OF QUALITIES, OUR GOAL IS TO GAIN INPUT FROM EVERYONE IN THE PLAN WHO PARTICIPATES. MAKE ANN ARBOR A LEADER NOT OF THE PAST BUT A LEADER FOR THE FUTURE. PLEASE INCLUDE ALL OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE FINAL WORK PLAN AND CONTRACT. THANK YOU.
00:12:39.823: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS JEANINE PALMS.
00:12:47.130: >> GOOD EVENING, MAYOR AND CITY COUNCILMEMBERS. I AM JEANINE PALMS, AND I LIVE ON 2656 EASY STREET. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE A PART OF THE CONSULTANT'S SELECTION PROCESS FOR THE MASTER LAND USE PLAN. I APPRECIATE THE TRUST AND THE WILLINGNESS TO INVITE CITIZENS INTO THIS PROCESS. THANK YOU FOR SELECTING ME. I LEARNED VERY MUCH ABOUT THIS KIND OF PROCESS AND ABOUT WORKING WITH OTHERS WHOM I HAD NOT KNOWN PREVIOUSLY. THROUGH NUMEROUS MEETINGS, CONVERSATIONS, AND ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS, WE GREW TO BE A TEAM, TRUSTING THAT WE WOULD EVENTUALLY FIND CONSENSUS. I AM ALSO GRATEFUL TO CITY STAFF FOR THE ENERGY, THOUGHTFUL PLANNING AND EXPERTISE THEY BROUGHT TO THIS PROCESS. I AM ESPECIALLY IMPRESSED WITH AND GRATEFUL FOR THE FACILITATION SKILLS THAT BRETT LENART BROUGHT TO THIS CHALLENGE. HIS CAPACITY TO ORGANIZE ALLOWED US TO MOVE ALONG. HE GUIDED WITH RESPECT, PATIENCE, RECEPTIVENESS TO DIVERSE OPINIONS, CONFIDENCE IN THE PROCESS AND TRUST IN US. I AM EXCITED ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY THAT MASTER LAND USE PLANNING OFFERS TO THE CITY. IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO CLARIFY OUR VALUES, OUR PRINCIPLES, TO SET A VISION OF WHAT WE WANT THIS CITY TO LOOK LIKE IN FIVE YEARS, IN TEN YEARS. WHAT WILL ANN ARBOR LOOK LIKE BEING CARBON NEUTRAL? WHAT WILL IT LOOK LIKE WITH A MASTER LAND USE PLAN INFORMED BY OUR VALUES THAT INCORPORATES ADEQUATE HOUSING AND JOBS FOR ALL, TRANSPORTATION THAT ALLOWS US TO MOVE IN WAYS THAT SUPPORT THE HEALTH OF THOSE BEING TRANSPORTED, AS WELL AS THE HEALTH OF THE THROUGHWAY. HEALTHY LOCALLY PRODUCED FOOD ACCESSIBLE TO ALL, CLEAN WATER FOR ALL, BACKUPS AND RESILIENCY IN THE FACE OF CLIMATE BREAKDOWN, MEANINGFUL EDUCATION ACCESSIBLE TO ALL, AND THRIVING NATURAL ECOSYSTEMS NETWORKED THROUGHOUT THE LANDSCAPES. THE PUBLIC PROCESS AT THE LAND USE PLAN INITIATES WILL ENGAGE US, THE CITIZENS OF THIS CITY, IN FORMULATING AND CLARIFYING OUR VALUES. THIS PROCESS CAN BECOME FERTILE GROUND FOR BUILDING COMMUNITY AS WE GRAPPLE WITH THE HUGE ISSUES OF OUR TIME TO DISCERN THE PART WE CAN PLAY IN IT. THERE LIES IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS, OUR COMMUNITIES, THE STRENGTH, INGENUITY, CREATIVITY AND GENEROSITY TO CREATE A VISION THAT WORKS FOR ALL, TO CREATE THE PATHS TO THAT VISION AND TO ACT TO MAKE IT A REALITY. WE CAN CREATE A NEW STORY, STARTING IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS, THAT, IN THE WORDS OF GEORGE MAMBIAT CAN BE CALLED THE POLITICS OF BELONGING. THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY FOR RESTORATION, FOR A NEW BEGINNING, FOR THE TRUST IN THE CITIZENS OF THIS CITY TO PARTICIPATE FULLY IN THE CREATION OF A NEW STORY OF HOW WE CAN LIVE. I LOOK FORWARD TO APPROVAL OF THE RESOLUTION TO AUTHORIZE AN AGREEMENT WITH INTERFACE FOR COMMUNITY VISIONING AND MASTER LAND USE PLAN SERVICES. THANK YOU.
00:15:47.377: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS WENDY CARMEN.
00:15:53.416: >> MY NAME IS WENDY CARMEN, 2340 GEORGETOWN FROM THE SECOND WARD. I TOO WAS APPOINTED TO THE SELECTION COMMITTEE. INVOLVING MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC IN THE SELECTION PROCESS WAS A GREAT STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION, AND WE WERE ALL HONORED TO JOIN, AND I BELIEVE INTERFACE STUDIO CAN DO THE JOB. THE APPOINTEE TEAM REPRESENTED A BROAD SPECTRUM OF VIEWS. YET, PROUDLY, WE WERE ABLE TO WORK TOGETHER TO PROVIDE A CONSENSUS LIST OF RECOMMENDATIONS. WE INFORMED PLANNING THAT WE HAD SOME CONCERNS AND WOULD BE SENDING THE RECOMMENDATIONS. MIDWAY THROUGH THE PROCESS, WE PROVIDED PLANNING WITH A DRAFT AND SAT DOWN TO DISCUSS IT. OUR FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS WERE PROVIDED BOTH TO STAFF AND TO COUNCIL. STATE LAW REQUIRES THE CITY TO REVIEW THEIR MASTER PLAN EVERY FIVE YEARS, AND WE HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY MEETING THAT LAW, BUT IN PIECES OVER TIME. THIS TIME AROUND, WE ARE INTENDING TO OVERHAUL THE ENTIRE MASTER PLAN, BASE IT ON CITY VALUES NOT YET ESTABLISHED, AND TRY TO PARE THE DOCUMENT DOWN TO ABOUT A HUNDRED PAGES. YOU MAY THINK THAT MASTER PLANNING IS TRIVIAL, BUT IT IS THE FOUNDATION OF OUR ZONING AND LAND USE CODES AND DIRECTLY AFFECTS EACH AND EVERY CITIZEN. EVALUATING THE MASTER PLAN IS THE PLANNING COMMISSION'S JOB. THEY AND STAFF CAN AND DID SEND OUT THE R.F.P. WITHOUT PARTICIPATION OF THE CITY COUNCIL. YET, COUNCIL HAS CONTROL OVER AND OBLIGATIONS FOR THE FINAL PRODUCT. THEY NOT ONLY NEED TO APPROVE THE CONTRACT, WHICH INCLUDES THE WORK PLAN AND THE BUDGET, THEY WILL NEED TO SHOULDER THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE PROJECT AND VOTE ON THE FINAL PLAN. OUR RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDE TOPICS SUCH AS ASKING FOR MORE BALANCED INVOLVEMENT OF THE PUBLIC, REAL PEOPLE, NOT JUST STAKEHOLDERS, AND ASKING FOR A VALID STATISTICAL SURVEY OF RESIDENTS' OPINIONS. THE OPINION-GATHERING MECHANISMS DESCRIBED IN THE WORK PLAN ARE FINE IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR IDEAS TO TALK ABOUT, AND THAT'S AN APPROPRIATE PART OF THIS PROCESS, BUT THEY ARE NOT VALID FOR EVALUATING THE RESIDENTS CITY VALUES OR FOR ESTIMATING SUPPORT FOR SOMEONE ELSE'S VALUES. THIS IS A BIG DEAL PROJECT. IT IS A BIG DEAL BUDGET, AND IT AFFECTS ALL OF OUR RESIDENTS. SO, SPEAKING FOR MYSELF, I BELIEVE IT CAN WORK, WITH FEW MODIFICATIONS. I DON'T BELIEVE YOU CAN DO IT WITH A PASS IT NOW AND FIX IT LATER PLAN. IN MY CAREER AS A STATISTICAL CONSULTANT, YOU NAILED THINGS DOWN BEFORE YOU SIGNED A CONTRACT WITH THE CLIENT, BECAUSE YOU NEVER CAN GUARANTEE WHAT WILL HAPPEN OTHERWISE. I HOPE YOU WILL PULL IT FROM THE CONSENT AGENDA AND SCHEDULE WORK SESSION TIME TO ADDRESS THE CONTRACT. YOU SHOULD BE -- YOU SHOULD UNDERSTAND WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED, THE BUDGET AND OUR RECOMMENDATIONS, AND BE ABLE TO COMMIT TO WHAT YOU ARE TAKING ON. THANK YOU.
00:19:02.238: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS DAVID SILKWORTH.
00:19:08.478: >> GOOD EVENING. MY NAME IS DAVID SILKWORTH. I'M A RESIDENT OF THE 5th WARD. I'M HERE TONIGHT TO SPEAK ABOUT TWO ITEMS ON TONIGHT'S AGENDA. THE FIRST IS CA8, THE RESOLUTION TO AUTHORIZE PROFESSIONAL SERVICES AGREEMENT WITH INTERFACE STUDIO, LLC, FOR COMMUNITY VISIONING AND MASTER LAND USE PLAN SERVICES. I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT UPDATE THAT OUR CITY WILL UNDERTAKE OVER THE NEXT 20 YEARS, BECAUSE IT PRESCRIBES WHAT OUR BUILT ENVIRONMENT COULD BECOME. THE DECISIONS MADE HERE IN THIS PROCESS WILL IMPACT EVERYONE WHO LIVES HERE. I HAVE READ THE COUNCIL AGENDA RESPONSE MEMO PERTAINING TO TONIGHT'S AGENDA, AND I AM CONCERNED ABOUT SEVERAL ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED. FOR EXAMPLE, WHETHER OR NOT TRANSPORTATION ELEMENTS FROM OUR RECENTLY CONTRACTED TRANSPORTATION MASTER PLAN UPDATE WILL BE CONCISELY INCORPORATED INTO IT, WHETHER OR NOT TO ADOPT THE RECOMMENDATIONS TO CREATE AN 18 TO 20-MEMBER STEERING COMMITTEE, WHICH ALSO INCLUDES SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS TO INCLUDE REPRESENTATIVES FROM VARIOUS NEIGHBORHOOD GROUPS, AND EXACTLY WHO WILL BE THE LOCAL COMMUNITY MEMBERS HIRED TO PERFORM THE PUBLIC OUTREACH FOR THIS PROJECT? BUT WHAT CONCERNS ME THE MOST IS THE FACT THE CONSULTANT IS CHARGING MORE THAN THREE QUARTERS OF A MILLION DOLLARS FOR A SCOPE OF WORK THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE A STATISTICALLY VALID COMMUNITY SURVEY. HOW ARE WE TO KNOW WHAT THE COMMUNITY ASPIRATIONS ARE WITHOUT COLLECTING STATISTICALLY VALID DATA? THE FIVE OPEN HOUSES THAT HAVE BEEN PROPOSED, WITH ONE IN EACH WARD IS A GOOD START, BUT THEY WON'T PROVIDE THE KINDS OF STATISTICALLY VALID DATA NEEDED TO ASSIST YOU, OUR POLICY-MAKERS, IN MAKING INFORMED, DATA-DRIVEN DECISIONS. THIS WILL BE A PROCESS EXTENDING THE NEXT TWO TO FOUR YEARS, SO I WOULD URGE ALL OF YOU NOT TO APPROVE THIS TONIGHT. INSTEAD, I WOULD ASK YOU TO POSTPONE THIS RESOLUTION UNTIL ALL OF THIS CAN BE WORKED OUT IN GREATER DETAIL, AND I ASK THAT YOU NOT APPROVE A FINAL CONTRACT UNTIL IT CONTAINS THE LEVEL OF DETAIL NEEDED TO ENSURE THAT ALL OF THE DIVERSE VOICES WITHIN OUR COMMUNITY ARE INCLUDED. THE SECOND ITEM ON TONIGHT'S AGENDA THAT I WOULD LIKE TO DISCUSS IS DC3, THE RESOLUTION TO ENDORSE HOUSE BILL 4738 AND THE CREATION OF A STATE-WIDE CROSSWALK LAW. I FULLY SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION, BECAUSE IT WOULD BE ADVANTAGEOUS FOR BOTH PEDESTRIANS AND MOTORISTS THROUGHOUT MICHIGAN. THE ADVANTAGE TO A STATE-WIDE LAW IS THAT IT WOULD STANDARDIZE RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES FOR ALL CROSSWALK USERS, WHICH CAN BE TAUGHT AND ENFORCED CONSISTENTLY THROUGHOUT THE STATE. I BELIEVE THAT THIS UNIFORMITY, WITH PROPER EDUCATION AND ENFORCEMENT, WILL LEAD TO IMPROVED PEDESTRIAN SAFETY FOR EVERYONE. THANK YOU.
00:21:59.081: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU.
00:27:23.171: >> I AM GOING TO BE RUNNING FOR CITY COUNCIL IN THE COMING ELECTIONS. I WILL BE REPLACING MR. JACK EATON, WHO HAS SPENT THE PAST SIX TO SEVEN YEARS THAT HE HAS SAT THERE. HE HAS SPENT IT WITH VIRTUALLY NO IMPACTON OUR WATERS. WE HAVE VERY DIRTY WATER IN ANN ARBOR. I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT FOR MANY, MANY MONTHS, AND WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT YOU ARE GOING THE WAY THAT YOU HAVE GONE FOR 30 YEARS, AND IT HAS ALLOWED MORE AND MORE EXPANDED PLUME. WE HAVE A LARGER PLUME NOW THAN WE HAVE EVER HAD, AND YOU ARE GETTING AROUND TO SPENDING MORE MONEY ON EXPENSIVE LAWYERS' FEES AND ENDLESS LITIGATION AND YEARS AND YEARS OF OUR LIVES SPENT WAITING FOR A CLEANUP OF THIS MASSIVE DIOXANE CONTAMINATION. I HAVE ADVOCATED, AND I WILL CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE FOR IMMEDIATE CLEANUP OF THIS TOXIC PLUME. MR. HAYNER HAS MORE INFORMATION THAN ANYBODY NEEDS TO TELL US THE ROAD THAT YOU HAVE TRAVELED FOR 30 YEARS HAS BEEN MISERABLY, MISERABLY WRONG. YOU HAVE SPENT HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN ENDLESS LAWYERS' FEES AND LITIGATION FEES, AND IT HAS BROUGHT US NO RELIEF FROM CONTAMINATION. YOU ARE DOING VERY SIMILARLY WITH PFAS CONTAMINATION. OUR WATER SEES SPIKES OF PFAS HERE AND THERE AND EVERYWHERE. YET, THE INDUSTRY THAT IS PUTTING OUT THIS CONTAMINATION HAS NOT BEEN CLOSED DOWN. IF A CITY IS SERIOUS ABOUT THE HEALTH OF ITS CITIZENS, YOU WOULD HAVE GONESSIVELY AGAINST THIS INDUSTRY, TRIBAR, IN WIXOM, AND YOU WOULD HAVE SHUT IT DOWN. THAT IS WHAT I EXPECT TO SEE FROM MY CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS. THAT IS WHAT I EXPECT TO SEE FROM MR. EATON, WHO REPRESENTS WARD 4, WHICH WILL BE REPLACED BY ME, AND I WILL GO VERY, VERY SERIOUSLY AND AGGRESSIVELY TO ADDRESS THESE PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES. SO I WANT TO TELL YOU THIS MONEY THAT YOU ARE GOING TO ALLOW YOURSELVES TO PAY FOR LAWYERS, $300 AN HOUR, TO CONTINUE THIS ENDLESS LITIGATION AND LAWYER GAMES THAT YOU HAVE BEEN PLAYING IS WRONG. YOU ARE SPENDING THIS MONEY IN A WRONG WAY. PEOPLE OF ANN ARBOR ARE SICK AND TIRED OF THIS POSTURE TOWARDS CONTAMINATION OF OUR WATERS, WHICH IS THE LARGEST IN THE WORLD. YOU HAVE ALLOWED THIS DIOXANE CONTAMINATION TO BECOME THE LARGEST IN THE WORLD. THIS IS A BIG SHAME ON OUR RECORDS, ON YOUR RECORDS. YOU CAN GET SERIOUS AND GO AFTER POLLUTERS AND BRING THEM TO JUSTICE, BUT YOU WON'T, BECAUSE IN YOUR HEARTS, YOU ARE STANDING WITH POLLUTERS. YOU ARE PROTECTING THEM. SO, STOP IT, CLEAN IT UP --
00:30:31.093: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU.
00:30:31.794: >> -- PUT THE SHOVEL TO THE GROUND AND CLEAN IT UP NOW.
00:30:35.064: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS BLAINE COLEMAN.
00:30:38.801: >> WELL, I AGREE THAT SPENDING $500,000 ON LAWYERS AFTER 30 YEARS OF SPENDING ALL OF THAT MONEY ON LAWYERS, HAVING ALL OF THOSE MEETINGS ENDLESSLY, TALKING ABOUT THE STATE AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ARE SOMEHOW GOING TO RESCUE YOU, AFTER 30 YEARS, I DON'T BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE EVER GOING TO MOVE BEYOND THE ENDLESS EXPENDITURE FOR LAWYERS, THE ENDLESS MEETINGS, THE ENDLESS PROMISES OF STATE AND FEDERAL HELP THAT NEVER COMES. TO ME, I AGREE THAT THE ONLY THING THAT MAKES SENSE IS FOR THE CITY COUNCIL TO MAKE SURE THAT SHOVELS GO IN THE GROUND NOW, THAT THE CLEANUP STARTS NOW, AGGRESSIVELY, AGAINST THIS POISONOUS DIOXANE PLUME. NOW, YOU HAVE HAD 30 YEARS YOU HAVE BEEN WASTING YOUR TIME. NOW IT'S TIME TO GET SHOVELS IN THE GROUND. IF YOU NEED TO HAVE A PUBLIC MILLAGE VOTE TO PAY FOR IT, GREAT. I AM SURE THE PUBLIC WILL DECIDE TO DO IT, BUT ENDLESS MEETINGS, ENDLESS LAWYERS, ENDLESS STATE AND FEDERAL MUSICAL CHAIRS GAMES, I DON'T SEE HOW THAT IS GOING TO BE THE SAME AS ACTUALLY PUTTING YOUR SHOVELS IN THE GROUND NOW AND CLEANING UP THE POLLUTION NOW. AND I AGREE THAT COUNCILMEMBER EATON HAS BEEN USELESS IN THIS REGARD, BUT HE ALSO HAS DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF IN A REALLY HORRIBLE WAY OTHERWISE, BEING STEADFASTLY OPPOSED TO PALESTINIAN HUMAN RIGHTS RESOLUTIONS IN THE CITY COUNCIL. FOR MOST OF HIS SEVEN YEARS IN THE CITY COUNCIL, HE'S NODDING HIS HEAD YES. FOR MOST OF HIS SEVEN YEARS IN THE CITY COUNCIL, EATON HAS TAKEN THE RACIST AND OUTRAGEOUS POSITION OF OPPOSING PALESTINIAN HUMAN RIGHTS RESOLUTIONS, AND I WILL BE GLAD AT ELECTION TIME TO SEE HIM PUT OUT TO PASTURE. ANY COMMENT FROM EATON? HE SMILED. IT'S NO MATTER FOR AMUSEMENT TO SEE ISRAEL GUNNING DOWN THOUSANDS OF PALESTINIAN HUMAN RIGHTS MARCHERS AND TO THROW ALL OF YOUR WEIGHT, AS EATON HAS, TOWARDS BLOCKING ANY PALESTINIAN HUMAN RIGHTS RESOLUTION IN THIS COUNCIL. FOR THAT REASON ALONE, HE NEEDS TO BE RETIRED FROM THIS CITY COUNCIL AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AT ELECTION TIME. NOT TO MENTION HIS NEGLECT OF THE ENVIRONMENT.
00:33:37.813: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS DEB POLLOCK.
00:33:49.358: >> THANK YOU, MAYOR. MEMBERS OF COUNCIL AND ADMINISTRATOR LAZARUS. I'M DEB POLLOCK, DIRECTOR OF THE ARTS ALLIANCE AND RESIDENT OF WARD 5, AND I'M HERE REGARDING THE HISTORIC ENTERTAINMENT SOUND ORDINANCE BEING INTRODUCED FOR ITS FIRST READING TONIGHT. THE ARTS ALLIANCE ADDS TO ANN ARBOR'S VIBRANCY AND MAKES IT AN ARTS AND CULTURAL DESTINATION. THE ARTS ALLIANCE IS IN FAVOR OF THIS PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO THE SOUND ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. IF IT ACCOMPLISHES THE INTENT STATED IN THE INFORMATION PROVIDED, WHICH IS TO PROTECT -- TO BE PROTECTIVE OF BOTH THE BUSINESS OWNERS AND THE USERS OF THE AREA, AS WELL AS NEARBY RESIDENTS. HOWEVER, BEFORE ADOPTION, THE ARTS ALLIANCE REQUESTED THE PROPOSED ORDINANCE BE POSTPONED UNTIL IT IS CLEARLY DEFINED, ITS BROADER IMPACT BE CONSIDERED, AND THAT IT BE APPLIED FULLY TO BENEFIT ALL OF THE RESIDENTS, BUSINESSES, AND ARTS CULTURAL ENTERTAINMENT, FESTIVAL PRODUCERS AND PROVIDERS. SPECIFICALLY, WE ASK COUNCIL TO EXPAND THE HISTORIC ENTERTAINMENT SOUND DISTRICT AS DEFINED TO INCLUDE THE ENTIRETY OF THE ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT AND ARTS AND CULTURE PROVIDERS THAT HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN IN THE HISTORIC LOCATION OF THE DOWNTOWN AREAS, BUT IN RECENT YEARS WHERE RESIDENCES HAVE DEVELOPED. DOWNTOWN IS FORTUNATE TO HAVE IN THE STATE STREET, THE SOUTH U AND KERRYTOWN DISTRICTS PLENTY OF THESE VENUES. SECOND, THE LANGUAGE AND NAME, HISTORIC ENTERTAINMENT SOUND DISTRICT, USED IN THE PROPOSAL RAISES A FEW QUESTIONS THAT SHOULD BE CLARIFIED. IS IT A SOUND ORDINANCE AMENDMENT? IS IT A DISTRICT OR NEIGHBORHOOD DESIGNATION? IS IT DEFINING HISTORIC ENTERTAINMENT VENUES AND BUSINESSES? HOW DOES IT IMPACT ZONING OR HOW IS IT TO BE APPLIED? IS IT INTENDED TO PREVENT ANY NEW BUSINESSES FROM OPENING A SIMILAR ARTS AND CULTURE VENUE? SOMETHING LIKE THE CITY LIBRARY LOT, IS THAT GOING TO BE ALLOWED OR NOT ALLOWED? LAST, THE GREATER ANN ARBOR AREA IS AN ARTS DESTINATION. MORE SIMPLY, WE HAVE A COMMUNITY THAT IS ALREADY DOING MUCH OF THIS. SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THOSE WE REPRESENT, WE ARE OPPOSED TO DESIGNATING AN AREA BY ENTERTAINMENT DISCIPLINES OR ART FORMS. THERE IS NO LINE OF DEMARCATION. THE SECTOR WORKS COLLECTIVELY AND COOPERATIVELY TO PROMOTE ITSELF AS AN ARTS DESTINATION. PLEASE, RATHER THAN SUBDIVIDING DOWNTOWN BY ART FORMS, CONTINUE TO DESIGNATE THE AREAS GEOGRAPHICALLY, BECAUSE DOING SO OFFERS PATRONS AND CONSUMERS DIRECTIONAL INFORMATION. I RESTATE THAT WE ARE INTERESTED AND SUPPORTIVE OF THE SOUND ORDINANCE DESIGNATION AND CHANGE, BUT PLEASE POSTPONE THIS SO THAT ALL THAT WILL BE AFFECTED WILL HAVE TIME TO CHIME IN AND PROVIDE THE INFORMATION THAT'S NECESSARY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.
00:36:48.437: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU. ARE THERE COMMUNICATIONS TODAY FROM COUNCIL? COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
00:37:02.017: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD: TONIGHT, AT 6:00, I PARTICIPATED IN A PODCAST BY LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR GARLAND GILLCREST, THRIVING CITIES, AND I JUST WANTED TO POINT OUT ONE THING. THE CITY WHERE THERE WERE UNIVERSITIES, THE NUMBER ONE CONCERN WAS AFFORDABLE HOUSING. FOR THE OTHER CITIES, THEY TOURED 19 CITIES, AFFORDABLE HOUSING WAS IN THE TOP THREE, SO AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS A MAJOR ISSUE THROUGHOUT THE URBAN AREAS OF MICHIGAN. NUMBER TWO, I CONTINUE TO WORK ON THE COMMUNICATIONS RESOLUTION. THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF INTEREST IN THAT. THE FOCUS IS ON TRANSPARENCY, COLLABORATION OF COUNCILMEMBERS, AND ACCURACY OF DATA. I WILL BE SENDING BACK TO THE COUNCIL RULES COMMITTEE, AS COUNCILMEMBER NELSON HAS EXPRESSED SOME INTEREST IN TAKING A LOOK AT IT AND POSSIBLY AMENDING IT. AND THE THIRD THING IS REGARDING THE 1,4-DIOXANE, THERE WILL BE A MEETING IN JANUARY ON THE 16th THAT OUR CONGRESSWOMAN, DEBBIE DINGELL, HAS ARRANGED. THE E.P.A. AND E.E.G.L. WILL BE PRESENT. I SEE THIS AS A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY TO GET INFORMATION SO THAT WE CAN MAKE A DECISION WITH THE MOST INFORMED INFORMATION POSSIBLE. THANK YOU.
00:38:31.106: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
00:38:34.142: >> COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER:  I JUST HAD A COUPLE FOUR QUICK ANNOUNCEMENTS. THOSE OF YOU FOLLOWING THE RESIDENTIAL PARKING PERMIT PROGRAM, WE HAVE BEEN WORKING BEHIND THE SCENES, AND THE CUSTOMER SERVICE TEAM IS NOW FULLY EQUIPPED TO RESPOND TO ANY PROGRAM-RELATED ISSUES RELATING TO RESIDENTIAL PARKING PERMITS, AND SO RESIDENTS COULD REACH OUT TO THE CUSTOMER SERVICE TEAM AT CUSTOMER SERVICE@A2 GOV.ORG OR CALL THEM DIRECTLY AT 794-6320, AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION HAS BEEN BUSY. NOT ONLY TONIGHT DO WE HAVE A RESOLUTION ABOUT HERITAGE TREES, BUT WE WILL ALSO BE BRINGING IN THE 1st OF THE YEAR A RESOLUTION ABOUT THE FOOD GATHERERS AND THEIR WORK TO HELP WITH OUR CARBON NEUTRALITY AND METHANE GAS EMISSIONS, SO THAT ONE IS WE ARE WORKING ON SOME FEE WAIVER ISSUES AND THE RESOLUTION ITSELF, AND WE ARE -- THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION, THROUGH THE NATURAL FEATURES SUBCOMMITTEE, IS -- WE ARE ALSO WORKING ON INTEGRATED PRACTICES, INTEGRATED FOR PESTICIDE MANAGEMENT BEST PRACTICES, AND WE ARE PULLING TOGETHER SOME PROACTIVE OUTREACH EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS TO THE COMMUNITY ABOUT HERBICIDES AND PESTICIDES, SO THOSE TWO, FOOD GATHERERS AND PESTICIDES ARE COMING FROM THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION. AND THEN LASTLY, THOSE OF YOU WHO WERE FOLLOWING THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND 2857 PACKARD ROAD, JENNIFER HALL FROM THE HOUSING COMMISSION AND OTHERS ARE STILL WORKING ON THE FEASIBILITY OF HOUSING, AFFORDABLE HOUSING AT 2857 PACKARD, AND SO I JUST WANTED TO REMIND EVERYONE THAT JANUARY 13, MONDAY NIGHT, WILL BE A WORKING SESSION ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING, AND WE'LL GET AN UPDATE ON ALL 12 OF THE CITY-OWNED PROPERTIES BEING CONSIDERED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THANK YOU.
00:40:41.202: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER COMMUNICATIONS FROM COUNCIL? I HAVE NOTHING FOR THIS EVENING. WE NOW COME TO THE CONSENT AGENDA. MAY I HAVE A MOTION PLEASE TO APPROVE THE CONSENT AGENDA? MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN, SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM. DISCUSSION OF THE CONSENT AGENDA.
00:41:00.589: >> MR. MAYOR, I WOULD LIKE TO PULL 12, 8 AND 13 PLEASE.
00:41:06.861: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE CONSENT AGENDA? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
00:41:13.735: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  I WOULD LIKE TO PULL CA20.
00:41:20.175: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE CONSENT AGENDA? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
00:41:26.147: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  THANK YOU. I WOULD JUST LIKE TO COMMENT ON CA4. THE FOURTH AMENDMENT TO PROFESSIONAL SERVICES FOR BODMAN FOR LEGAL SERVICES FOR THE 1,4-DIOXANE ISSUE, AND I HAVE TO AGREE WITH OUR SPEAKERS, THAT IT'S DIFFICULT TO SEE $300 AN HOUR GO TO LEGAL FEES WHEN WE HAVE A CLEANUP ISSUE LIKE THIS. LAST WEEK WE HAD A JOINT WORKING SESSION, AND IT WAS AN INTERESTING THING, THE WAY THEY HAD THE ROOM SETUP. THERE WAS PUBLIC AT THE START, AND WE HAD OUR PUBLIC CONVERSATION AT THE START, AND THEN, OH, WE HAVE TO GO INTO OUR CLOSED SESSION TO DISCUSS THINGS THAT THE COURT HAS NOT ALLOWED US TO DISCUSS WITH THE PUBLIC, WITH PUBLIC EXPERTS, WITH OTHERS IN THE FIELD OUTSIDE OF THAT ROOM, AND IT'S VERY FRUSTRATING FOR ME PERSONALLY, AND I AM SURE IT IS FOR MY COLLEAGUES, THAT WE CAN'T SHARE THIS INFORMATION, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY THAN SHARING THE INFORMATION, IS WE CAN'T SEEK THE ADVICE AND COUNSEL OF THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THIS MATTER CLOSER THAN ANYBODY FOR THE LAST 30 YEARS, 25 YEARS. SO THAT'S FRUSTRATING TO ME, AND SO WHEN WE WENT INTO THE CLOSED SESSION, THEY CLOSED UP THE ROOM, AND TWO ROWS' WORTH OF ATTORNEYS AND THEIR STAFF CAME BEHIND THE DOORS WITH US, AND IT JUST DIDN'T FEEL RIGHT, SO I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT, BUT I DO WANT TO SAY -- I'LL SPEAK FOR MYSELF. I'M TRYING TO DO THE BEST I CAN, AND I HOPE OTHERS ARE TOO, AND WE ARE WORKING ON IT.
00:42:50.665: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
00:42:52.801: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. THANKS FOR PULLING THOSE ITEMS, AND I JUST HAVE SOME BRIEF COMMENTS ON CA16 AND CA9. CA16 IS A LARGE CHANGE ORDER. IT'S OVER $300,000, AND IT RELATES TO THE 2019 SIDEWALK REPAIR PROGRAM. THE CHANGE ORDER IS BEING PRESENTED AFTER THE FACT, AFTER ALL OF THE MONEY HAS ALREADY BEEN SPENT, AND OBVIOUSLY THAT'S A VIOLATION OF OUR S. WE WOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN THAT, HOWEVER, UNLESS I HAD ASKED A QUESTION ABOUT IT, BECAUSE IT DID SEEM A BIT ODD. THE RESPONSE ACKNOWLEDGED THE PROCESS ISSUE AND INDICATED STEPS ARE BEING TAKEN TO MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN. THAT'S GOOD, BUT WHAT'S CONCERNING IS THAT THE VIOLATION WAS NOT ACKNOWLEDGED AND EXPLAINED UPFRONT IN THE COVER MEMO. PEOPLE MAKE MISTAKES. THERE ARE OVERSIGHTS. THAT'S OKAY AND COMPLETELY UNDERSTANDABLE, BUT TRANSPARENT ACCOUNTABLE ORGANIZATIONS ACKNOWLEDGE THE MISTAKES, FIX THEM, AND MOVE ON. THEY DON'T TRY TO SLIDE THEM THROUGH INSTEAD WITHOUT ANY ACKNOWLEDGEMENT. IF THE COVER MEMO HAD ADDRESSED THIS, I WOULDN'T BE BRINGING IT UP TONIGHT, BUT IT DIDN'T. AND WHILE I RECOGNIZE THIS ISN'T A HUGE DEAL, IT'S JUST NOT THE KIND OF TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY I THINK WE SHOULD BE STRIVING FOR. ON A MORE PLEASANT NOTE, I WANTED TO MENTION THAT CA9, WHICH IS TO APPROVE THE BROWNFIELD AGREEMENT, WHICH IS PAYING FOR THE CLEANUP COSTS AT LESLIE SCIENCE CENTER, THE GRANT IS FOR OVER A HALF MILLION DOLLARS, AND THAT'S MONEY THE CITY WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN SPENDING. THE COUNTY HAS REALLY STEPPED UP ON THIS ONE, AND THAT'S APPRECIATED. THANK YOU.
00:44:36.037: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR OF THE CONSENT AGENDA, WITH THE EXCEPT OF CA 8, 12, 13 AND 20 PLEASE SAY EYE. [ CHORUS OF AYES ] OPPOSED? THE CONSENT AGENDA WITH THE EXCEPTION OF 8, 12, 13 AND 20 IS APPROVED, WITH ALL COUNCILMEMBERS VOTING IN THE AFFIRMATIVE, THUS SATISFYING THE VOTE REQUIREMENTS WITH RESPECT TO CA11, CA17, AND THAT IS ALL -- PARDON ME, THANK YOU, CA4. THANK YOU, CA8, RESOLUTION TO AUTHORIZE A PROFESSIONAL SERVICES AGREEMENT WITH INTERFACE STUDIOS LLC FOR MASTER LAND USE PLANNING PURPOSES, MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER. DISCUSSION, PLEASE, OF CA8, COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
00:45:31.192: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  THANKS, MR. MAYOR. THIS IS A HUGE DEAL. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WHO ARE HERE TONIGHT AND WHO ADDRESSED THIS DURING PUBLIC COMMENTARY. THEY HAVE DONE YEOMEN AND WOMEN'S WORK, AND YOUR DEDICATION AND THE PRODUCT THAT YOU DELIVERED TO US IS OUTSTANDING, AND IT REFLECTS YOUR HARD WORK AND DILIGENCE, SO THANK YOU VERY, VERY MUCH. AS MANY OF YOU NOTED, THIS MASTER PLAN UPDATE IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS THAT WILL HAPPEN IN OUR CITY. THE ACTIONS AND DIRECTION OF THE UPDATE WILL LIKELY DRAMATICALLY IMPACT WHAT ANN ARBOR IS YEARS FROM NOW. ITS FEEL, ITS CHARACTER, ITS VIBRANCY IN THE DOWNTOWN AND IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS. I AGREE WITH STAFF THAT IT'S PAST TIME FOR AN UPDATE. WE ARE WORKING WITH DOCUMENTS AND PLANS THAT ARE NOW DECADES OLD, AND MUCH HAS CHANGED. IT IS A MASSIVE TASK, BUT ONE THAT WE MUST UNDERTAKE, AND I APPLAUD STAFF FOR THE PROCESS THAT'S TRANSPIRED IN THE EVALUATION OF THE CONSULTANT PROPOSALS. IT HAS BEEN AN INCREDIBLY THOROUGH PROCESS, AND THE ADDITION OF THE COUNCIL-APPOINTED GROUP AS PART OF THE EVALUATION TEAM WAS A REALLY POSITIVE ADDITION. MY SINCERE THANKS AGAIN TO BOTH THE STAFF AND THE COUNCIL-APPOINTED GROUP FOR YOUR HERCULEAN EFFORTS. THE REPORTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS YOU HAVE PROVIDED US AND THE COMMUNITY WORK ARE VALUABLE. YOU HAVE ALL DONE EXCELLENT WORK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BECAUSE IT IS SO IMPORTANT TO THE FUTURE OF OUR CITY, IT IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL THAT WE GET IT RIGHT, AND THAT MEANS SETTING THE PROCESS AND THE STRUCTURE CORRECTLY UP FRONT. I AM NOT FULLY CONFIDENT THAT WE HAVE DONE THAT, AND I DO THINK, AS HAS BEEN SUGGESTED, THAT A WORK SESSION WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL BEFORE WE FINALIZE THE CONTRACT, AND ALSO I THINK WE SHOULD ADOPT THE KEY RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE COUNCIL-APPOINTED GROUP RELATED TO THE STEERING COMMITTEE ROLES AND MEMBERSHIP AND VETTING OF CITY VALUES THROUGH A STATISTICALLY VALID COMMUNITY SURVEY. PLEASE DON'T GET ME WRONG. MY SUGGESTING THAT WE TAKE A SLIGHT PAUSE TO ENSURE WE HAVE GOT IT RIGHT AND MAKE A COUPLE OF STRUCTURAL CHANGES IS NOT TO SAY STAFF'S RECOMMENDATIONS ARE FUNDAMENTALLY FLAWED. THE EVALUATION PROCESS AND RECOMMENDATIONS ARE SOLID, BUT I THINK THAT THEY COULD BE IMPROVED A BIT BY TAKING A BIT MORE TIME TO REVIEW AND DIGEST THE COUNCIL-APPOINTED TEAM'S RECOMMENDATIONS. I THINK A BROAD-BASED STEERING COMMITTEE, AS HAS BEEN RECOMMENDED, WILL ENSURE THE PROCESS REMAINS ON TRACK AND CONSISTENT WITH THE WHOLE OF THE COMMUNITY'S VIEWS AND VALUES, AND VETTING THE VALUES VIA A SCIENTIFIC RESIDENTS SURVEY USED TO GUIDE THE PROCESS WOULD ENSURE BOTH MORE COMMUNITY BUY-IN AND PROVIDE A GREATER PROBABILITY THAT THE ACTUAL LAND USE AND ZONING UPDATES REFLECT COMMUNITY PREFERENCES. I'M VERY INTERESTED IN HEARING WHAT MY COLLEAGUES HAVE TO SAY AND WHETHER YOU SHARE MY CONCERNS, BUT AS I SAID, I'M NOT YET COMFORTABLE THAT WE ARE READY TO HIT THE GO BUTTON. YES, WE DO NEED TO UPDATE THE MASTER PLAN. YES, STAFF HAS DONE A GOOD JOB IN BRINGING US TO THIS POINT, BUT I'M NOT CONVINCED THAT A BIT MORE WORK AND TWEAKING WOULD NOT RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED STRUCTURE AND PROCESS. I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF AMENDMENTS ABOUT THE SURVEY AND THE STEERING COMMITTEE THAT I CAN SEND YOU, AND I'M HOPEFUL THAT WE'LL POSTPONE IT FOR A WORK SESSION, AND I CAN SEND YOU THESE AMENDMENTS, AND WE CAN AMEND IT BEFORE WE -- IF WE POSTPONE. THANK YOU.
00:49:14.816: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER EATON?
00:49:15.650: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  THANK YOU. I WANT TO THANK COUNCILMEMBER LUMM FOR OUTLINING THE IMPORTANT CONCERNS ABOUT THIS. I WANT TO THANK STAFF FOR A PROCESS THAT INCLUDED RESIDENTS IN THE SELECTION OF THE CONSULTANT. I THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT METHOD FOR GETTING COMMUNITY INPUT AT AN EARLY STAGE OF THE PROCESS. I ESPECIALLY WANT TO THANK THE CITIZENS WHO PARTICIPATED IN THAT SELECTION PROCESS, AND I WANT TO THANK THOSE CITIZENS FOR THEIR WORK AFTER THE SELECTION HAD BEEN MADE. I THINK THEY HAVE GIVEN US A GOOD IDEA OF WHAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS BEFORE WE APPROVE THIS RESOLUTION OR THE CONTRACT, FOR THAT MATTER. THE PROCESS OF REDESIGNING OUR MASTER PLAN IS GOING TO BE A LONG PROCESS. THIS RESOLUTION SAYS IT COULD BE TWO YEARS, WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF A TWO-YEAR EXTENSION, AS WE WITNESSED WITH THE REVISIONS TO OUR UDC. IT'S GOING TO PROBABLY TAKE LONGER THAN THAT IF IT'S DONE CORRECTLY, AND SO I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE TO BEGIN ON THE RIGHT FOOT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A PROCESS AND A PLAN IN PLACE TO MAKE SURE THAT WHAT WE DO FOR THE NEXT TWO TO FOUR YEARS PRODUCES THE BEST PRODUCT, AND SO WITH THAT THOUGHT, I'M GOING TO MOVE TO POSTPONE THIS UNTIL THE FIRST MEETING IN FEBRUARY IN HOPES THAT WE CAN HAVE A WORK SESSION PRIOR TO THAT MEETING.
00:51:01.055: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  SECONDED? SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM. COUNCILMEMBER EATON, I GUESS YOU STILL HAVE THE FLOOR.
00:51:06.127: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  I AM DONE.
00:51:08.095: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  POSTPONEMENT OF THE DISCUSSION UNTIL -- DID YOU SAY THE FIRST OF FEBRUARY?
00:51:13.267: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  THAT'S WHAT I SAID, BUT I AM WILLING TO ALTER THAT IF STAFF BELIEVES IT WOULD TAKE LONGER.
00:51:22.810: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THAT'S CONSIDERATION OF THE PLAN ITSELF UNTIL THAT TIME. DISCUSSION OF THE POSTPONEMENT? MR. LAZARUS FOR TIMING?
00:51:31.352: >> CITY ADMIN. LAZARUS:  JUST AS AN ADMINISTRATIVE NOTE, COUNCIL WOULD HAVE TO SCHEDULE AN ADDITIONAL WORK SESSION, BECAUSE THE ONE WORK SESSION IN JANUARY IS DEVOTED TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING, AND WHEN YOU GET INTO FEBRUARY, YOU START THE VERY IMPORTANT BUSINESS OF CONSIDERING THE CITY BUDGET.
00:51:45.499: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  SO CAN YOU SUGGEST A DATE THAT THIS WOULD COME BACK, THAT WOULD PROVIDE YOU ENOUGH TIME TO SCHEDULE A WORK SESSION ON THIS SUBJECT?
00:51:54.108: >> CITY ADMIN. LAZARUS:  I WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT THE CALENDAR, COUNCILMEMBER, BUT I CAN DO THAT -- IF YOU DECIDE TO POSTPONE IT, I CAN SEND A RECOMMENDATION, PROBABLY TOMORROW, WHENEVER WE HAVE A CHANCE TO LOOK, AND WE WOULD ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE WORK SESSION IS CONVENED AT A TIME FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO BE THERE.
00:52:17.465: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  I WOULD SUGGEST TABLING UNTIL AT LEAST AFTER A FIRST MEETING OF A WORK SESSION.
00:52:22.536: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  I GUESS IT IS MOVING UP TO TABLING. IS THAT FINE? THAT WOULD REQUIRE, FOR FOLKS WHO DON'T TEND TO TABLE VERY MUCH, THE IDEA WOULD BE TO HAVE A WORK SESSION SCHEDULED, AND THEN A MOTION ON THE FLOOR TO BRING IT BACK. I ASSUME AT THAT POINT THAT IT WOULD BE BROUGHT BACK AT A SUBSEQUENT MEETING. IT WOULD BE BROUGHT BACK FOR THE PURPOSES OF POSTPONING TO A SUBSEQUENT MEETING SO AS TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT NOTICE FOR PEOPLE TO COME IN AND OPINE. IS THAT CONSISTENT WITH PEOPLE'S UNDERSTANDING AND EXPECTATION?
00:52:51.966: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  THAT WOULD WORK FOR ME.
00:52:53.601: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  ALL RIGHT. SO THE MOTION TO TABLE, FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [ CHORUS OF AYES ] OPPOSED? IT IS TABLED. CA12, RESOLUTION TO APPROVE THE PURCHASE OF A CONSERVATION EASEMENT ON THE BUS OR PROPERTY IN NORTHFIELD TOWNSHIP, APPROVE OR PARTICIPATE IN AGREEMENT WITH WASHTENAW COUNTY PARKS AND RECREATION COMMISSION. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRAND, SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM. DISCUSSION OF CA12? COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
00:53:25.232: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. WE HAVE THREE GREENBELT ACQUISITIONS TONIGHT, AND AS IS MY STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE ON THESE, I SUPPORT THOSE WHERE ANN ARBOR TAXPAYER DOLLARS ARE LEVERAGED WELL AND OPPOSE THOSE WHEN THEY ARE NOT. CA11 IS A CONSERVATION EASEMENT WHERE THERE IS EXCELLENT LEVERAGE. THE CITY IS PAYING FOR A THIRD OF THE ALL-IN COSTS, AND I WAS HAPPY TO SUPPORT THAT ONE. CA12, HOWEVER, DOES NOT LEVERAGE ANN ARBOR TAX DOLLARS WELL. THIS IS A CONSERVATION EASEMENT IN NORTHFIELD TOWNSHIP, WHERE THE GREENBELT PROGRAM ENDS UP PAYING 71% OF THE ALL-IN COSTS, INCLUDING THE CLOSING, DUE DILIGENCE, AND ENDOWMENT COSTS. NORTHFIELD TOWNSHIP IS NOT CONTRIBUTING ANYTHING TOWARD THE PURCHASE. WE ARE TOLD NORTHFIELD TOWNSHIP IS CONSIDERING A CONSERVATION EASEMENT, AND WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT FOR A WHILE NOW, BUT NOTHING IS IN PLACE, SO THERE IS NO CONTRIBUTION FROM THE HOST, AND THAT'S BOTHERSOME TO ME. IT'S JUST NOT FAIR FOR ANN ARBOR WHEN THE ENTITY BENEFITING MOST CONTRIBUTES NOTHING. CA13 IS A CONSERVATION EASEMENT IN LODI TOWNSHIP. ALTHOUGH LEVERAGE ISN'T AS BAD AS CA12, IT'S STILL NOT GREAT. THE GREENBELT PROGRAM IS FUNDING 60% OF THE ALL-IN COSTS. LODI TOWNSHIP IS CONTRIBUTING A THOUSAND DOLLARS, AND WHILE BETTER THAN NOTHING, IT STILL DOESN'T FEEL LIKE AN EQUITABLE COST SHARING, SO I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING CA12 AND CA13 TONIGHT, AND THANK YOU FOR LISTENING.
00:54:59.927: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION?
00:55:01.128: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  FOR ALL OF THE REASONS THAT COUNCILMEMBER LUMM STATED, I WILL BE OPPOSING THOSE AS WELL.
00:55:05.366: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER GRAND?
00:55:06.233: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRAND:  THANK YOU. I CAN CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE PUSH TO LEVERAGE AND GET MAXIMUM LEVERAGE FOR PROPERTIES. I THINK IT HAS PUSHED THE GREENBELT TO THINK STRATEGICALLY AND TO TRY TO ASK FOR MORE WHERE NECESSARY. THESE, AND THERE IS I THINK A REALLY EXCELLENT EXPLANATION OF WHY WE COULDN'T LEVERAGE FOR PROPERTIES THIS SIZE IN THE SAME WAY WE COULD FOR OTHER PLACES WHERE WE CAN ACCESS FEDERAL MATCHING FUNDS. THE GREENBELT RECENTLY WENT THROUGH A STRATEGIC PLAN, WHICH I HOPE COUNCIL WILL SUPPORT WHEN IT COMES TO THEM IN JANUARY, AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HEARD LOUD AND CLEAR FROM MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY IN GOING THROUGH THAT STRATEGIC PLANNING PROCESS IS THAT THEY WANT THE GREENBELT TO BE SUPPORTING SMALL NEW FARMERS AND LOCAL FOODS, AND THESE PROPERTIES, BECAUSE THEY ARE SMALL IN SIZE, DON'T QUALIFY FOR THE SAME KINDS OF FEDERAL MATCHING FUNDS THAT CAN PROVIDE THOSE MORE EYE-POPPING NUMBERS, BUT THEY DO PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR NEW FARMERS TO BE ABLE TO GET INTO AGRICULTURE, AND TYPICALLY THOSE ARE PRACTICES THAT WE SUPPORT THOSE FARMS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE ORGANIC PRACTICES, SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES, COMPARED TO LARGE FARMS. SO, I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN ABOUT MATCHING, BUT THESE PROPERTIES ARE CERTAINLY IN LINE WITH WHAT WE HEARD FROM MEMBERS ACROSS THE COMMUNITY IN OUR STRATEGIC PLANNING PROCESS. THEY ARE ALSO SMALLER INVESTMENTS IN TERMS OF OVERALL DOLLARS BUT REALLY WILL PROVIDE THOSE OPPORTUNITIES TO PRESERVE LAND AND FARMS FOR THE FUTURE. SO I HOPE THAT YOU WILL SUPPORT IT.
00:56:51.005: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
00:56:53.707: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  JUST BRIEFLY, I THANK BOTH OF MY COLLEAGUES FOR THEIR VIEWS ON THIS, AND I AGREE THAT WE REALLY WANT THE TOWNSHIPS TO BE IN FOR MORE. THIS PARCEL HERE, IF YOU SET ASIDE THE POLITICAL BOUNDARIES THAT FALL IN OUR AREA HERE, THIS ONE IS BASICALLY ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE STREET, YOU MIGHT SAY. IT'S JUST NORTH OF JOY ROAD. IT'S JUST INSIDE OF NORTHFIELD TOWNSHIP, SO THEY DON'T FEEL COMPELLED TO COUGH UP ANY CASH FOR THESE THINGS, BUT I THINK THIS IS A PURCHASE THAT WILL CONTINUE A GREAT BLOCK OF ANN ARBOR TOWNSHIP EASEMENTS, AND IT'S APPROPRIATELY CONTIGUOUS TO WHAT WE HAVE GOING IN THAT AREA, AND EVEN THOUGH WE ARE PAYING MORE, I'M GOING TO FIND MYSELF SUPPORTING THIS ONE. I'M SORRY THAT IT FINDS ITSELF ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE STREET, AND I WISH THE FOLKS IN NORTHFIELD TOWNSHIP, AND I KNOW THEY ARE WORKING ON IT, THEY NEED TO PICK IT UP BECAUSE THESE PROPERTIES ARE GOING FAST, AND WE WANT TO BE A PART OF IT, AND IF THEY WANT TO BE A PART OF IT, THEY NEED TO GET IN ON THIS QUICKLY. I KNOW THE NORTHFIELD FOLKS DID A LOT OF WORK, AND MAYBE I CAN REACH OUT TO THE COMMUNITY BOARD MEMBER WHO REPRESENTS THAT AREA AND SEE IF WE CAN GET HER TO GET THEM TO MOTIVATE A LITTLE.
00:58:06.947: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS AS WELL. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE REASONS IDENTIFIED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRAND TO SUPPORT OUR LOCAL FARM CULTURE. I KNOW RESIDENTS APPRECIATE IT WHEN THEY KNOW THAT THEIR FOOD IS GROWN NEARBY, AND WE ARE DOING WHAT WE CAN TO HELP MAKE THAT HAPPEN AND MAKE THAT SOMETHING THAT FUTURE ANN ARBORITES WILL BE ABLE TO ENJOY FOR YEARS TO COME. FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
00:58:34.942: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  I HAVE JUST GOT A QUESTION. SORRY, IF I CAN ASK STAFF. IS THIS A WORKING FARM RIGHT NOW?
00:58:47.221: >> GOOD EVENING, MAYOR AND COUNCIL. REMY IS THE STAFF PERSON WHO DOES AND WORKS THESE DEALS WITH THE PROPERTY OWNERS, SO I'M GOING TO LET HIM ANSWER.
00:58:58.165: >> ARE WE TALKING ABOUT THE BEESER PROPERTY OR THE STONE PROPERTY?
00:59:01.802: >> BEESER.
00:59:03.037: >> BEESER IS CURRENTLY RESTORED FIELDS. IT'S ALL NATIVE, PLANTED IN NATIVE GRASSLANDS CURRENTLY, BUT THE CONSERVATION EASEMENT WOULD RESERVE THE RIGHT TO AT ANY TIME USE THAT AS TILLABLE LAND FOR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION. SO THE CURRENT OWNER IS INVOLVED WITH WORKING WITH FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE TO RESTORE THE OLD AG FIELDS, BUT AT ANY TIME IS OPEN TO THE CONCEPT OF HAVING THAT TILLED OVER INTO LOCAL AG PRODUCTION.
00:59:31.432: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  THANK YOU.

01:01:15.235: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  THANK YOU. I'LL BE BRIEF. I DON'T HAVE MUCH TO SAY. I JUST WANTED TO BRING UP AND SPOTLIGHT SOME OF THE FUNDING SOURCES FOR THIS. IT CALLS FOR $40,000 TO BE PAID FOR BY THE COUNTY HEALTH MILLAGE IN THE FISCAL YEAR '21. I STRUGGLE WITH USING THOSE FUNDS IN WAYS WHERE WE ARE USING THEM HERE IN CA20. I BELIEVE THE CONTRIBUTIONS SHOULD BE COMING FROM THE DDA IN THIS REGARD. THIS AREA DOES FALL IN THE DDA DISTRICT. MANY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ARE COLLECTED BY THE DDA IN PROPERTY TAXES, AND I DON'T FEEL THAT THE $40,000 BEING USED FROM OUR MENTAL HEALTH MILLAGE SHOULD BE APPLIED IN THIS PROJECT. IT WILL NOT HOLD UP MY VOTE TONIGHT, AND I APPRECIATE THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN IN PARTNERING UP WITH THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR TO BRING THESE IMPROVEMENTS MUCH NEEDED TO THAT AREA. THIS IS A HUGE PROJECT, ALMOST $9 MILLION, SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT 40,000, IT'S NOT A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT, BUT IN PRINCIPLE, I'M GOING TO HAVE A HARD TIME SUPPORTING THIS TYPE OF EXPENDITURE IN THESE AREAS FROM THAT MILLAGE. WE NEED TO CALL UPON THE DDA TO DO MORE TO FUND THESE TYPE OF IMPROVEMENTS.
01:02:40.287: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
01:02:45.359: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  I KNOW MR. RAIN IS HERE TONIGHT, AND I WOULD JUST LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND THANK THE U OF M FOR TAKING THE LEAD ON THIS PROJECT. IT IS A MAJOR PROJECT, AS HAS BEEN NOTED, A $9 MILLION PROJECT, OF WHICH THE U OF M IS BEARING 6 MILLION DOLLARS OF THAT 9 MILLION DOLLAR COST. OHM WAS HIRED AS A CONSULTANT, AS WE KNOW. THE DESIGNER OF THE PROJECT AND THE CITY AND THE UNIVERSITY HAVE WORKED WITH O.H.M. ON THE COST SHARING, AND THEY ARE VERY DETAILED COST SHARING FORMULAS, SO I THINK THIS IS A GREAT PARTNERSHIP. AND THANK YOU, UNIVERSITY, AND I DON'T KNOW IF ANYONE -- MR. RAIN AGAIN IS HERE IF ANYBODY HAS ANY QUESTIONS FOR HIM. SO, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US TONIGHT.

C1, AN ORDINANCE TO ADD A NEW CHAPTER 122 (HISTORIC ENTERTAINMENT SOUND DISTRICT) TO TITLE IX OF THE CODE OF THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER EATON. DISCUSSION, PLEASE, OF C1. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
01:06:33.920: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  THANK YOU, MAYOR TAYLOR. WE HAVE HEARD A LOT IN THE LAST FEW DAYS FROM MEMBERS IN OUR COMMUNITY WHO ALL PARTICIPATE IN THE CULTURAL ASPECTS, AND I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A MOTION TO POSTPONE THIS UNTIL WE GET MORE FEEDBACK AND DISCUSSION WITH MORE MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY ABOUT THIS, SO I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A MOTION TO POSTPONE THIS TO THE SECOND MEETING IN JANUARY.
01:07:11.024: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER EATON. DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
01:07:15.629: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRAND:  I JUST WANT TO THANK EVERYONE FROM THE COMMUNITY WHO REACHED OUT TO US IN SUPPORT OF THE FACT THAT WE DO HAVE WONDERFUL CULTURAL VENUES THROUGHOUT THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR, AND IT WAS A GREAT REMINDER FROM MANY PEOPLE, NOT ONLY MS. POLLOCK WHO SPOKE TO ELOQUENTLY TODAY, BUT WE HEARD FROM THE SOUTH UNIVERSITY AREA ASSOCIATION TODAY AND FROM VARIOUS FOLKS AROUND THE CITY. SO, IT WAS A NICE REMINDER THIS TIME OF YEAR ALL THAT YOU DO TO MAKE OUR LIVES BETTER.
01:07:50.263: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  MR. LAZARUS?
01:07:51.198: >> CITY ADMIN. LAZARUS:  THANK YOU, MAYOR. THIS ITEM WAS COUNCIL-INITIATED, SO I WOULD LIKE TO DEFER. WHEN YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY, I HAVE SOME THOUGHTS ON WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE MODIFIED OR AMENDED IN THE RESOLUTION AS IT IS CURRENTLY PRESENTED TO COUNCIL FOR ITS CONSIDERATION.
01:08:12.519: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  HAYNER, LUMM, RAMLAWI.
01:08:16.856: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  THANK YOU, MR. ADMINISTRATOR. AND WOULD WE SEND THOSE TO YOU AND THE ORIGINAL SPONSORS OF THE BILL, OR WOULD YOU LIKE IT TO GO?
01:08:24.464: >> CITY ADMIN. LAZARUS:  I THINK THAT'S FINE.
01:08:26.333: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  STAFF AND SPONSORS MAKES SENSE.
01:08:30.804: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  I WILL SUPPORT THIS POSTPONEMENT FOR REASONS THAT OTHERS HAVE SAID, AND THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF HISTORIC PROPERTIES THAT HAVE OFFERED THIS ENTERTAINMENT, AND I HAVE HAD CUSTOMERS DOWN IN THE LIBERTY STREET AREA WHO HAVE RUN INTO THESE PROBLEMS WITH SOUND. WE HAVE HAD -- YOU KNOW, WE HAVE A LOT OF OUTDOOR VENUES, AND THE TRUTH IS ANN ARBOR IS SO STEEPED IN CULTURE, AS COUNCIL WOMAN GRAND SAID, AND ARTS VENUES, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE LIKE NINE, 10,000 CITIES ON THAT SIDE OF LIBERTY, TALKING ABOUT THE POWER CENTER, MICHIGAN THEATER, LIBERTY PLAZA, SO ON, SO ON. WE COULD REALLY HAVE A THEATER DISTRICT RUN THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF LIBERTY STREET, ALL THE WAY DOWN MAIN AND THE ARC AND EVERYTHING. IT'S A HUGE UNDERTAKING. I THINK IT'S RIGHT TO POSTPONE IT TO GET MORE INPUT FROM THOSE FOLKS AND ALSO LOOK AT WHAT ARE WE ASKING AND THE EFFORT BEING MADE. I'M A BIG FAN OF DECIBEL METERS. I HAVE A PROFESSIONAL DECIBEL METER, AND A CAR ON WET PAVEMENT AT 25 MILES AN HOUR IS IN EXCESS OF THE RESIDENTIAL ORDINANCE. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS IS NOT BACKGROUND NOISE BUT THEY CAN PICK OUT THE BEAT, AND IT SOUNDS LIKE A BAND, IT SOUNDS LIKE A DISCO, THIS OR THAT, SO IT'S NOT THAT THE NOISE ITSELF IS DISRUPTIVE, IT'S JUST THAT THEY MAKE THE CALL, THEY MAKE THE NONEMERGENCY CALL, SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO HAVING OUR COMMUNITY POLICING FOLKS CHIME IN ON THIS TOO. SO THANK YOU FOR SUGGESTING A POSTPONEMENT.
01:10:05.398: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
01:10:06.232: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR AND TO THE SPONSORS FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND ALSO TO THE FOLKS THAT WE HAVE HEARD FROM, SOUTH UNIVERSITY, MICHIGAN UNIVERSITY, THE ARC. SOUTH UNIVERSITY, THE VARIOUS BUSINESS DISTRICTS, WHO WOULD LIKE US TO CONSIDER EXPANDING TO INCORPORATE THEIR AREAS IN THIS PROPOSAL, AND I KNOW THAT WOULD BE A SUBSTANTIVE CHANGE, AND SO BRINGING IT BACK, YOU KNOW, AS IS OBVIOUSLY WOULD REQUIRE A REDO OF THE FIRST READING, BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE, YOU KNOW, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A -- WE ARE GOING TO POSTPONE IT, AND I'M JUST WONDERING, MR. ADMINISTRATOR OR WHOMEVER I SHOULD DIRECT THIS TO, WHAT IS THE PLAN FOR GETTING THIS INPUT FROM ALL OF THESE BUSINESS DISTRICTS? BECAUSE THAT'S -- WE WERE ASKED TO POSTPONE IT TO GET THAT FEEDBACK, AND SO WE NEED A -- OBVIOUSLY, WE NEED A METHODICAL WAY TO GO ABOUT THAT, SO WHEN IT COMES BACK TO US, WE ARE READY TO, YEAH, MOVE.
01:11:13.800: >> CITY ADMIN. LAZARUS:  I APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERNS, AND WE WILL HAVE A METHODICAL METHOD FOR REACHING OUT TO THOSE WHO SPOKE.
01:11:21.541: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  SO WE CAN DO THIS BETWEEN NOW AND -- IT WAS POSTPONED TO, WHAT, THE SECOND MEETING OF JANUARY? SO WE CAN HAVE THESE OUTREACH MEETINGS WITH THE BUSINESS DISTRICTS? YEAH.
01:11:35.388: >> CITY ADMIN. LAZARUS:  I CAN'T ASSURE THAT. I THINK IT --
01:11:38.658: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  MAYBE WE NEED TO POSTPONE IT TO ANOTHER DATE.
01:11:45.365: >> CITY ADMIN. LAZARUS:  MAYBE YOU COULD TABLE IT UNTIL WE HAVE A CHANCE TO DO THAT.
01:11:48.601: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  OKAY. I WILL DEFER TO THE SPONSORS.
01:11:52.906: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, YOU ARE ON THE QUEUE.
01:11:56.042: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  THANK YOU. OUR INTENT INITIALLY WAS NOT TO EXCLUDE FOLKS AND PICK WINNERS AND LOSERS. WE WERE APPROACHED BY MANY IN THE AREA THAT THIS ENCOMPASSES TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES THAT THEY HAVE WITH THE NOISE COMPLAINTS THEY GET, AND OBVIOUSLY IT HAS GARNERED A LOT OF ATTENTION, AND MANY IN THE COMMUNITY ALSO ARE INTERESTED IN HAVING THIS AS A PART OF THEIR JURISDICTION. I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LOT LONGER THAN THE 45 DAYS THAT HAVE BEEN ASKED FOR TO GET THE INPUT TO BRING IT BACK TO COUNCIL, SO WE HAVE THREE ASSOCIATIONS THAT HAVE LEADERSHIP WHO CAN COME TO THE TABLE, I BELIEVE, AND WORK WITH STAFF AND WORK WITH THE SPONSORS AND WORK WITH THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR TO INCORPORATE A LARGER PART OF OUR DOWNTOWN AREA, TO OFFER THE SAME PROTECTIONS THAT THIS ORDINANCE HAS.
01:13:01.274: >> CITY ADMIN. LAZARUS:  I'M GOING TO ASK MR. DELACOURT TO COME UP. I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF DEMANDS ON HIS STAFF'S TIME RIGHT NOW, AND I'M JUST CURIOUS BEFORE I OVERCOMMIT HIM TO WHAT HIS THOUGHTS ARE.
01:13:13.520: >> NO, ACTUALLY, I THINK THE TIME FRAME IS FINE FOR US. WE STARTED WITH A SMALLER PIECE OF GEOGRAPHY FOR QUITE THE OPPOSITE REASON, THAT WE WERE AFRAID IF WE TRIED TO ENCOMPASS TOO MUCH GEOGRAPHY, THAT WE WANTED TO -- I DON'T WANT TO SAY TEST IT OUT, THAT'S NOT THE RIGHT WORD, BUT A SMALLER PIECE OF GEOGRAPHY DEFINED, AND WHERE WE HAD CONSENT FROM THE BUSINESS OWNERS WITHIN THAT DISTRICT WHO WERE WILLING TO BE CHAMPIONS OF THIS AND PARTNER WITH US TO DO IT. IF COUNCIL WANTS TO EXPAND IT, I HAVE VERY LITTLE CONCERN WITH WITH THAT IN MEETING WITH THE OTHER ORGANIZATIONS. AS WE HAVE SAID AGAIN AND AGAIN, THE ORDINANCE AS PROPOSED CHANGES THE EXISTING SOUND ORDINANCE ONLY TO ACCOUNT FOR THE SOUNDS PRODUCED WITHIN THOSE DISTRICTS. WE WERE WOEFULLY SHORT WHEN IT CAME TO FLEXIBILITY WITH THESE AREAS OF THE CITY. IT'S NOT THAT THESE STRUCTURES' USES ARE HISTORIC IN THE TRADITIONAL SENSE, BUT THE USES OF THEM IN THE ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT HAS HISTORICALLY ALWAYS BEEN THERE, AND THE SOUND HAS ALWAYS BEEN THERE, BUT THE ORDINANCE HAS FAILED TO REGULATE IT APPROPRIATELY. IT'S JUST TO ACCOUNT FOR WHAT WE FEEL IS THERE CURRENTLY. WE CAN REACH OUT TO OTHER ASSOCIATIONS, IDENTIFY THEM, MAP IT AND BRING IT BACK TO COUNCIL I BELIEVE WITHIN THAT TIME FRAME.
01:14:34.467: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, YOU STILL HAVE THE FLOOR.
01:14:36.869: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  I APPRECIATE STAFF'S EXPLANATION OF IT AND WILLINGNESS TO TAKE THIS ON. AND THEY ARE BETTER ABLE TO EXPLAIN IT CONCISELY, AND I'LL YIELD THE FLOOR.
01:14:50.984: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  I'LL JUST PUT IN MY TWO CENTS. I'M DELIGHTED THAT THIS HAS BEEN BROUGHT FORWARD. I THINK IT MAKES LOTS OF SENSE FOR DIFFERENT PARTS OF OUR DOWNTOWN. OBVIOUSLY ON THE CURRENTLY DESIGNATED DISTRICT, BUT ALSO TO STATE STREET, OTHER PARTS OF LIBERTY, SOUTH U. IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE. COUNCILMEMBER EATON AND HAYNER, AND THEN PERHAPS WE CAN MOVE THIS ALONG SINCE EVERYBODY SEEMS TO THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA.
01:15:15.475: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  THIS IS MY POINT, THAT A GROUP OF SELECT BUSINESSMEN APPROACHED US AND RATHER THAN TRY TO FOIST IT ON THE ENTIRE DOWNTOWN AREA, WHICH WAS ONE OF OUR CONSIDERATIONS, IS JUST TO USE THE DDA AREA, WE WANTED TO EXPERIMENT WITH IT INCREMENTALLY. I HAVE NOT HEARD ANY COMPLAINTS ABOUT APPLYING THIS. IT'S MORE OF WE ARE GETTING COMPLAINTS ABOUT NOT APPLYING IT BROADLY ENOUGH.
01:15:41.200: >> RIGHT.
01:15:41.467: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  AND SO I CERTAINLY SUPPORT POSTPONING THIS AND BROADENING THE DISTRICT THAT IT WOULD APPLY TO. I DIDN'T MEAN TO SLIGHT ANYBODY BY EXCLUDING ANY GIVEN VENUE, BUT WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WE WERE GOING TO RUN INTO IF APPLIED IT TO WHOLE AREAS THAT HAD NOT ASKED FOR IT. THAT'S BASICALLY WHY WE DID A LIMITED TEST ZONE.
01:16:08.594: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
01:16:09.629: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  THANK YOU FOR RECOGNIZING ME TO ASK A QUESTION. DOES THIS ACT SORT OF LIKE -- SOMEONE ASKED ME THIS, ARE YOU CREATING A SOUND OVERLAY DISTRICT OR A NOISE OVERLAY DISTRICT?
01:16:18.838: >> WELL, IT IS A SPECIFIC MAPPED AREA. IT IS NOT AN OVERLAY IN THE SENSE THAT THE UNDERLYING SOUND REQUIREMENTS ARE DIFFERENT THAN THE TOP. BUT IT DOES AMEND THE SOUND ORDINANCES FOR JUST THIS MAPPED AREA. SO, IN ESSENCE, IT'S VERY, VERY SIMILAR, IF NOT SYNONYMOUS.
01:16:36.823: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  YOU KNOW, OUR SOUND ORDINANCES ARE MEASURED AT THE RECEIVING PROPERTY, AND SO ARE WE ASKING THESE RECEIVING PROPERTIES, THE FRINGE NEIGHBORHOODS, THEIR TWO CENTS ON THIS, OR ARE WE GOING TO KIND OF JUST GUESS HOW THEY FEEL?
01:16:50.970: >> AS WITH ANY ORDINANCE, THERE'S A PUBLIC HEARING INVOLVED, AND OUR INTENT WAS, BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T HAD MUCH COMMENTARY AT A STAFF LEVEL OR ANY CONCERN WITH IT, WAS TO TREAT IT LIKE A NORMAL PUBLIC HEARING AND ALLOW A SECOND READING AT THAT PUBLIC HEARING.
01:17:04.217: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  I APPRECIATE THAT, AND I'M ALWAYS UP FOR A PUBLIC HEARING. I WAS JUST WONDERING HOW WE WOULD NOTIFY THESE ADJACENT NEIGHBORHOODS THAT THERE WAS INDEED A PUBLIC HEARING. IT'S NOT LIKE A -- WOULD WE BE NOTIFYING WITHIN A THOUSAND FEET OF THE EXISTING MAPPED PARAMETER AREA OR A POTENTIAL FUTURE ONE? I'M CURIOUS HOW THAT WOULD WORK.
01:17:29.208: >> I WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK AND CHECK, BUT WE DON'T NOTICE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF FEET. WE WOULD NOTICE IT THROUGH THE NORMAL PROCESS, WHICH I THINK IS A GENERAL NOTICE IN THE PAPER. CLEARLY, THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK, TO DATE, WE HAVEN'T RECEIVED ANY COMMENT ON, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE WON'T. BUT AS STAFF, WE DON'T DO ANYTHING DIFFERENTLY AS FAR AS WHAT THE REQUIREMENTS ARE IN THE ORDINANCE.
01:17:56.435: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER NELSON?
01:17:58.104: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT WHAT WE ARE ALL KIND OF IMAGINING MG FORWARD, THE IDEA OF EXPANDING IT OR DEFINING ADDITIONAL DISTRICTS. I APPRECIATE THE PERSPECTIVE OF HAVING A STARTING POINT, OF STARTING SMALL AND SEEING HOW IT WORKS. I GUESS I HEARD YOU SAY A MOMENT AGO THAT YOU WOULD CONSIDER REACHING OUT TO OTHER ASSOCIATIONS OR OTHER NEIGHBORHOODS. IS THAT HOW YOU ENVISION THIS POTENTIALLY EXPANDING, OR DO YOU IMAGINE THAT AN ASSOCIATION WOULD BE REACHING OUT TO YOU AND ASKING FOR A DESIGNATION IN A DIFFERENT PART OF THE CITY? HOW DO YOU IMAGINE THAT HAPPENING?
01:18:35.741: >> IN THE COUPLE OF MINUTES I HAVE HAD TO THINK ABOUT IT -- [ LAUGHTER ] -- I WOULD SUGGEST, OBVIOUSLY, THERE HAS BEEN A FEW FOLKS WHO HAVE SPOKEN TONIGHT. WE WOULD CONTACT THEM OR MAKE OURSELVES AVAILABLE TO THEM, AND THEN WE WORK ON A REGULAR BASIS WITH THE MERCHANT AND DOWNTOWN ASSOCIATIONS, WHETHER IT'S STATE OR THE GUILD, WE'D REACH OUT TO THEM FIRST, SIT DOWN WITH THE DIRECTORS OF STAFF FOR THOSE FOLKS, REACH OUT TO THE DDA, SEE IF THERE'S ANYTHING WE ARE NOT CONSIDERING, SHOULD IT BE THE ENTIRE DDA AND ITS BOUNDARY, OR DO WE HAVE OTHER HISTORIC BOUNDARIES FOR THESE VENUES, AND WE WOULD REACH OUT AND THEN MAKE COMMENTS.
01:19:17.416: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  ALL IN FAVOR? [ CHORUS OF AYES ] ALL OPPOSED? IT IS POSTPONED. DC1, RESOLUTION TO SUPPORT CENTER OF THE CITY INTERIM USE AND LONG TERM PLANNING FOR THE CENTER OF THE CITY/LIBRARY LOT PROPERTY MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER EATON, SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER. DISCUSSION, PLEASE, OF DC1. COUNCILMEMBER EATON?
01:19:32.598: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  THANK YOU. SO AT A PREVIOUS MEETING, WE BROUGHT THIS RESOLUTION FORWARD, AND THIS MERELY ADDRESSES HOW WE USE THESE PROPERTIES, WHILE THE TASK FORCE DESIGNS A VISION OF THE PERMANENT AND LONG-TERM USE OF THE PROPERTIES, AND WE WERE ASKED TO POSTPONE THIS SO THAT IT COULD BE SENT TO THE TASK FORCE ITSELF TO COMMENT, DELIBERATE OVER AND OPINE UPON, AND THEY HAVE PASSED A RESOLUTION EXPRESSING NO OPPOSITION TO THIS RESOLUTION, SO LONG AS WE DON'T SPEND SUBSTANTIAL MONEY ON INFRASTRUCTURE CHANGES ON THOSE PROPERTIES. AND SO I WOULD ASK FOR YOUR INDULGENCE AND ALLOW US TO PROCEED ON THESE IDEAS, MOST OF WHICH WERE DRAWN FROM A MEMO AUTHORED BY THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR. THANK YOU.
01:20:28.921: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
01:20:29.956: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  THANK YOU, AND COUNCATON IS CORRECT, AND THANK YOU FOR COMING TO THE TASK FORCE MEETING LAST WEEK TO BE THERE AND BE HEARD. AND IT'S TRUE, WE PASSED A RESOLUTION THAT SAID WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY OBJECTIONS TO THIS. ONE OF THE CONCERNS YOU MENTIONED WAS THE COST. WE ARE ALL IN A POSITION WHERE WE DON'T WANT TO MAKE A COST COMMITMENT TO A PROJECT ONLY TO HAVE IT BE TORN DOWN AND RESHUFFLED AS THE TASK FORCE'S RECOMMENDATIONS CHANGE PERHAPS FROM WHAT'S EXPECTED, BUT WE DO FULLY SUPPORT THE NOTION THAT THIS SHOULD BE A PUBLIC SPACE THAT'S AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. THE FINAL RESOLVED CLAUSE HAS A BULLETED LIST OF ITEMS THAT ARE COULD BE CONSIDERED, AND WE HAVE ASKED THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR TO COLLABORATE WITH THE DDA TO PLAN FUND IMPROVEMENTS, AND I WOULD ONLY ASK, PERHAPS IF THIS IS FRIENDLY TO THE BODY, THAT THE THIRD BULLET POINT, WHICH TALKS ABOUT PUBLIC RESTROOMS, WHICH ARE REALLY A NECESSARY ITEM DOWN THERE, IF WE COULD PERHAPS SAY PUBLIC RESTROOMS, COMMA, TEMPORARY AND/OR FIXED TO MATCH UP WITH THE PERFORMANCE SPACE, TEMPORARY AND/OR FIXED, WHICH IS THE FOURTH ITEM, TO GIVE A SUGGESTION THAT WE COULD ACT RIGHT AWAY BUT MAY ALSO PUT IN SOMETHING MORE PERMANENT IN THE FUTURE. THAT WAS ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT WAS EXPRESSED, PROBABLY THE ONLY CONCERN THAT WAS EXPRESSED AT THE CENTER CITY MEETING. SO WOULD THAT BE CONSIDERED FRIENDLY?
01:21:52.038: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  IS THERE A SECOND ON THAT? IS THAT FRIENDLY TO THE BODY? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, YOU STILL HAVE THE FLOOR.
01:21:59.345: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  THANK YOU. I JUST ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS. IT IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.
01:22:06.318: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
01:22:08.354: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR, AND THANKS AS WELL TO COUNCILMEMBER EATON FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD, AND TO THOSE FOLKS IN THE COMMUNITY WHO HELPED PULL THE PLAN AND THE RESOLUTION TOGETHER. I DO APPRECIATE THAT WE POSTPONED THIS AT THE LAST MEETING IN ORDER TO GET FEEDBACK FROM THE CENTER OF THE CITY TASK FORCE. CITY COUNCIL CREATED THE TASK FORCE TO BE THE LEAD ON THIS WHOLE EFFORT, SO TO PASS A RESOLUTION, EVEN ONE WITH SLIGHTLY DIFFEFOCUS, SHORTER TERM VERSUS LONG TERM WITHOUT THE TASK FORCE REVIEWING IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN APPROPRIATE OR FAIR TO THE TASK FORCE. THE FOCUS OF THIS RESOLUTION IS SHORTER TERM, AND IT'S APPROPRIATE WE DO THAT. THE TASK FORCE IS WORKING, AND I APPRECIATE COUNCILMEMBERS SERVING ON THIS COMMITTEE. THEY ARE WORKING ON LONG-TERM RECOMMENDATIONS, AND I GUESS IT'S LIKELY WE'LL SEE THOSE IN FEBRUARY OR SO. IN THE MEANTIME, IT MAKES SENSE TO KEEP THIS SITE ON THE RADAR SCREEN AS THE CENTER OF THE CITY PUBLIC SPACE, AND TO DO THOSE MINIMAL INVESTMENT ACTIONS THAT ENCOURAGE MORE ACTIVE PUBLIC USE OF THE PROPERTY, ACTIONS LIKE ADDING BENCHES, TABLES, INTERNET CONNECTIVITY, BATHROOMS, PERFORMANCE SPACE, BARRIER FREE PLAY AREAS. NONE OF THESE ARE SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENTS OR CAUSE POTENTIAL CONFLICT WITH WHATEVER THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND DECISIONS ARE IN THE LONGER TERM. THAT WAS THE PRIMARY CONCERN OR REQUEST OF THE TASK FORCE, AS I UNDERSTAND IT, TO NOT MAKE SUBSTANTIVE PERMANENT CHANGES TO THE SITE UNTIL THEY HAVE COMPLETED THEIR WORK, AND THE RESOLUTION IS CONSISTENT WITH AND RESPECTS THAT REQUEST. I ALSO BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT TO BEGIN TO ESTABLISH THE OPERATING STRUCTURE FOR THE PROPERTY, THINGS LIKE ACCOUNTING AND FUNDING SOURCES, AND TO FULLY ENGAGE THE CITY AND THE DDA IN THE EFFORT. THE RESOLUTION DOES THAT, INCLUDING EARMARKING A PORTION OF THE PARKING REVENUE FOR THE SITE FOR THE IMPROVEMENTS, AND THAT, TOO, MAKES A LOT OF SENSE. SO, OTHER THAN THE CONCERN ABOUT NOT MAKING SUBSTANTIVE PERMANENT IMPROVEMENTS, THE TASK FORCE HAS INDICATED IT HAS NO OBJECTIONS TO THE RESOLUTION, AND I THINK THAT IS IMPORTANT NEW INFORMATION, AND I'M PLEASED AND COMFORTABLE TO SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION TONIGHT, SO, THANK YOU, AGAIN, COUNCILMEMBER EATON FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD.
01:24:28.093: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
01:24:28.961: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRAND:  THANK YOU. I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING THIS RESOLUTION THIS EVENING. THERE ARE PARTS OF IT THAT I FIND INCREDIBLY PROBLEMATIC. ONE IS THE RESOLVED CLAUSE, THE SECOND RESOLVED CLAUSE THAT SAYS THAT THE REVENUE FROM THE LIBRARY LANE SERVICE PARKING WILL HELP TO FUND THE CENTER OF THE CITY IMPROVEMENTS. THOSE WHO ARE IN FAVOR OF PROPOSAL A MADE IT VERY CLEAR, AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE NOW TRYING TO WALK THAT BACK, WHICH I FIND JUST TRULY DISINGENUOUS, THAT THIS WOULD BE A MAINLY PRIVATELY PROJECT. WHAT I HAVE SEEN SO FAR IS A GROUP THAT'S LARGELY RAISED MONEY JUST TO PASS PROPOSAL A AND IS NOW PRETENDING THAT THAT WAS NEVER SAID AND NOT COMING FORWARD WITH ANY MONEY RAISED. WE HAVE OTHER FANTASTIC EXAMPLES IN THE CITY OF PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS, WHERE GROUPS HAVE ENTERED INTO CONTRACTS WITH THE CITY, WHERE THEY TALK ABOUT HOW THEY WILL SHARE THOSE MONEYS. THOSE MONEYS HAVE OFTEN FORMULATED THE FOUNDATION OF THE CITY'S ABILITY TO GO OUT AND GET GRANTS THAT HAVE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL AND ENDED UP FUNDING A LARGER PORTION OF THE PROJECT COST, BUT THOSE CAME FROM AND AS A RESULT OF THE ABILITY OF CITIZENS TO HOLD TRUE TO THEIR PROMISES TO RAISE MONEY FOR THESE EFFORTS. SO I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING ANYTHING HAVING TO DO WITH ALLOCATIONS FOR THE CENTER OF THE CITY UNTIL, AND, YOU KNOW, FOR THE SURFACE PARKING LOT, UNTIL MONEY COMES FORWARD FROM THESE PRIVATE GROUPS AND THEY FULFILL THEIR PROMISES. THE OTHER PART THAT I FIND INCREDIBLY PROBLEMATIC IS THIS IDEA THAT $875 A DAY, SIX DAYS A WEEK, FROM THE PARKING -- FROM PARKING REVENUES, WHICH ADDS UP TO $273,000 A YEAR IN PARKING REVENUES, WOULD AUTOMATICALLY BE ALLOCATED TO THIS PROJECT. NOT ONLY WOULD IT BE ALLOCATED GOING FORWARD, BUT THIS RESOLUTION ASKS THAT WE GO BACK ALL THE WAY TO REVENUES THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN RECEIVED FROM NOVEMBER 6TH, 2018. THAT, TO ME, IS FISCALLY IRRESPONSIBLE. IT ALSO FLIES IN THE FACE OF PROMISES THAT WERE MADE BY PROPOSAL A PROPONENTS THAT THEY WOULD BE FUNDING MOST OF THIS OR THAT IT WAS SUCH A FANTASTIC IDEA THAT PRIVATE CITIZENS WOULD COME FORWARD TO FUND IT. SO, THE THIRD PART THAT I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH, EVEN THOUGH THERE WAS INPUT FROM THE TASK FORCE THAT WE HAVEN'T EVEN RECEIVED THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE TASK FORCE, I DON'T HAVE AN ISSUE WITH THE LAST RESOLVED CLAUSE ABOUT TRYING TO USE THE SPACE, HAVING TEMPORARY USES, EXPERIMENTING WITH HOW IT MIGHT WORK FOR OUR COMMUNITY, BUT I DO HAVE VERY SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT THIS $273,000 A YEAR IN PARKING REVENUES BEING EARMARKED TO PAY FOR SOMETHING THAT WE DON'T EVEN HAVE A PLAN FOR, AND THAT IS BASED ON BROKEN PROMISES.
01:27:37.716: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  I WOULD LIKE TO STEP IN AND PUT IN MY TWO CENTS AND CONCUR WITH COUNCILMEMBER GRAND'S CONCERN, ONE POINT IN PARTICULAR WITH RESPECT TO THE FUNDING. WE DON'T HAVE AUTHORITY TO TELL THE DDA WHAT TO DO WITH THEIR PARKING REVENUE. THE MONEY THAT WE GET FROM THE DDA FROM PARKING REVENUE GOES STRAIGHT TO OUR GENERAL FUND. WE ARE NOT GOING TO GET -- THE DDA IS NOT GOING TO FUND -- WE CAN'T ORDER THE DDA TO FUND ANYTHING FROM THEIR PARKING REVENUE, WHICH OUGHT TO GO TO FUND THE PARKING SYSTEM. MONEYS THAT COME TO US FROM THE PARKING SYSTEM, BASED UPON OUR OWNERSHIP OF THE PARKING SYSTEM, GO TO OUR GENERAL FUND. SO MAKE NO MISTAKE, THIS IS NOT MAGIC MONEY FROM THE DDA, $875 A DAY. THIS IS MONEY THAT COMES FROM THE GENERAL FUND, SO THAT'S ONE PROBLEM THAT I HAVE WITH THE RESOLUTION. SECOND, THERE HAS BEEN SUGGESTIONS THAT THIS IS VERY LIMITED, THAT WE ARE NOT ASKING THE ADMINISTRATOR TO DO VERY MUCH, WE ARE NOT ASKING STAFF TO DO ANYTHING THAT HAS A DURATION TO IT. INSTRUCTING THE ADMINISTRATOR TO PLAN AND FUND UTILITIES ON-SITE IS EXPENSIVE. TO DIRECT THE ADMINISTRATOR TO PLAN AND FUND A PERFORMANCE SPACE IS MATERIAL. IT'S EXPENSIVE. PUBLIC RESTROOMS, SOLAR PANELS, THIS TAKES -- THIS IS REAL MONEY, AND THE RESOLUTION, ALTHOUGH IT HAS WITHIN IT NO LIMITATIONS, AND SO I WOULD REQUEST THAT A COUNCILMEMBER BRING AN AMENDMENT SAYING SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT THAT RESOLVED, AND PERHAPS AS A FINAL RESOLVED CLAUSE, THAT NOTHING IN THIS RESOLUTION DIRECTS OR REQUESTS THE ADMINISTRATOR TO TAKE ANY ACTION THAT WOULD IN THE AGGREGATE INCUR COSTS OR EXPENSES IN EXCESS OF $25,000. IF THIS IS JUST A LIMITED RESOLUTION, MAKE IT SO. IF IT'S CAMEL'S NOSE, OWN UP TO IT. COUNCILMEMBER SMITH, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR. I WOULD BE GRATEFUL IF YOU MADE THAT AMENDMENT.
01:29:54.720: >> COUNCILMEMBER SMITH:  I WILL MAKE THAT AMENDMENT.
01:29:57.556: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  IS THERE A SECOND? SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN. DISCUSSION OF THE AMENDMENT. COUNCILMEMBER SMITH YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
01:30:03.629: >> COUNCILMEMBER SMITH:  I THINK IT'S A WORTHWHILE AMENDMENT. I THINK THAT YOU SAID IT VERY SUCCINCTLY, THAT THIS IS REALLY A GENERAL FUND REQUEST AND A BUDGET REQUEST. I WOULD THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE THE TYPE OF THING THAT IF WE ARE GOING TO MAKE A MIDYEAR ADJUSTMENT, IT SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE 8-VOTE REQUIREMENT. BUT I THINK, YOU KNOW, AT LEAST PHILOSOPHICALLY, WE WENT THROUGH A PROCESS SEVERAL YEARS AGO WITH A SKATE PARK, WHEN THE FRIENDS OF THE ANN ARBOR SKATE PARK CAME FORWARD AND ASKED TO WORK WITH THE CITY TOOP A SKATE PARK. MY PREDECESSOR IN THIS SEAT FAMOUSLY PULLED HIS POCKETS OUT AND SAID WE DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY TO PAY FOR ANYTHING; YOU RAISE ALL OF THE MONEY. AND SO THEY DID. WE HEARD LOTS OF TIMES DURING THE CAMPAIGN ON PROPOSAL A, AS COUNCILMEMBER GRAND NOTED, THAT THERE WOULD BE PRIVATE PHILANTHROPY STEPPING UP TO FUND THIS RIGHT AND LEFT. I DON'T SEE IT. I WILL BELIEVE IT WHEN I DO SEE IT, BUT UNTIL THAT TIME, YOU KNOW, WE DIDN'T PASS A MILLAGE TO PAY FOR THIS. THIS IS A PARKS SPACE. IT HAS IMPLICATIONS ON OUR PARKS BUDGET. IT HAS CLEARLY AN IMPLICATION ON OUR GENERAL FUND BUDGET, AND IF WE DON'T KEEP THIS TO A $25,000 EXPENDITURE, IT IS A MAJOR BUDGET COMMITMENT, AND I WOULD NEVER SUPPORT THAT.
01:31:28.213: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
01:31:30.515: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  TWO POINTS I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE REAL QUICKLY. I WOULD LOVE FOR MY COLLEAGUES TO PLEASE SHOW ME WHERE PROP A SAID PRIVATE MONEY WAS GOING TO FULLY FUND THIS. IT KEEPS GETTING SAID, BUT I DON'T RECALL THAT MYSELF. I WOULD LOVE TO SEE IT ON A FLIER OR SOMETHING, PLEASE. SECONDLY, THIS ISN'T A PARK. IT'S A COMMONS. THE TRUTH IS A COMMONS IS GET ALL OF YOUR CARS OFF OF THERE AND LET THE PEOPLE DECIDE WHAT TO DO. THAT'S THE ESSENCE OF A COMMONS. WE DON'T NEED TO ASK FOR MONEY TO REVITALIZE A COMMONS OR TO CREATE A COMMONS. A COMMONS IS FOR THE COMMON GOOD. IT'S FOR EVERYONE TO WORK TOGETHER TO DECIDE WHAT THEY WANT TO DO WITH THAT SPACE, TO UTILIZE THE SPACE IN A LAWFUL WAY THAT IS FOR THE GOOD OF THE COMMUNITY, SO THE TRUTH IS WE COULD JUST HAVE A RESOLUTION THAT SAYS GET YOUR CARS OFF OF THERE SO THAT WE COULD START USING THIS AS A COMMONS, NOT AS A PARK, NOT AS PART OF THE PARK BUDGET, NOT AS SOME KIND OF BURDEN ON OUR BUDGET. IT'S A COMMON SPACE, AND SO THESE ARE IDEAS THAT MAKE THE SUGGESTIONS THAT IT WOULD BE MUCH MORE ABLE FOR PEOPLE TO UTILIZE THEM FOR THE KINDS OF PURPOSES THAT WE VISUALIZE AS A COMMONS PURPOSE, BUT IT'S NOT UP TO JUST ME. IT'S UP TO THE COMMONS, AND THAT'S ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE IN THESE -- IT'S NOT A PROBLEM, BUT THAT'S ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE IN THESE CENTER OF THE CITY TASK FORCE MEETINGS, IS THAT THE SPACE IS BEING CREATED, AND IT REALLY IS A COMMON SPACE, WHICH IS AN UNUSUAL APPROACH TO CLEARING A PUBLIC SPACE AND SETTING ASIDE A PUBLIC SPACE FOR THE FREE USE OF ALL, AND THAT'S WHAT A COMMONS MEANS. SO IT'S NOT A PARK. IT'S NOT A PARK, AND THE UTILITIES ALREADY EXIST, BECAUSE WE PUT, SUPPOSEDLY WITH THE APPROVAL OF EVERYONE ELSE, $5.4 MILLION INTO BUILDING THAT UP SO IT COULD BE A 16-STORY BUILDING. SO I DOUBT THEY HAVE TO GO FAR FOR POWER. IN FACT, I THINK IT WAS SAID THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE FEW PARKING STRUCTURES THAT COULD SUPPORT GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE, BECAUSE THERE IS SO MUCH POWER WAITING FOR A GIANT BUILDING TO SIT THERE. SO I'M NOT CONCERNED ABOUT MR. LAZARUS'S ABILITY TO GET POWER UP TO THAT SITE. SO I COULD TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT WITH THIS, BECAUSE I'M ON THAT CENTER CITY TASK FORCE, AND IT'S TRUE, OUR SUGGESTIONS HAVE NOT BEEN BROUGHT FORWARD YET, BUT I DON'T SEE THIS IN ANY WAY STYMYING THOSE SUGGESTIONS, AND I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK FOR MR. LAZARUS, BUT I DON'T THINK THAT HE WOULD GO OFF WRITING CHECKS WITHOUT ASKING US FIRST.
01:34:04.903: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
01:34:07.939: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I WANT TO SUPPORT THIS. I WASN'T A PROPONENT OF PROPOSAL A. I THINK THAT ULTIMATELY WHAT OUR COMMUNITY DID WAS TURN DOWN $10 MILLION FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING, $5 MILLION TO THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUND, AND $5 MILLION TO THE Y LOT TO INVEST IN WHAT IS, YOU KNOW, PROLONGING THE EXISTENCE OF A PARKING LOT. THAT SAID, IT WAS THE DIRECTION OF RESIDENTS TO MOVE THIS WAY, AND I THINK IF IT IS GOING TO BE SITTING AS A PARKING LOT, I WOULD PREFER IT TO HAVE SOME TYPE OF ACTIVE USE. I DO NOT WANT THAT ACTIVE USE TO COME AT THE COST OF, YOU KNOW, SHIFTING MONEY FROM OTHER PRIORITIES THAT THE CITY HAS. OUR GENERAL FUND GOES TO SUPPORT SAFETY SERVICES, IT GOES TO SUPPORT ALL OF OUR PUBLIC PARKS AND THE 2002 ACRES OF THEM SPREAD ACROSS THE CITY, NOT JUST THIS .8 ACRES OF DOWNTOWN PARKING STRUCTURE. I'LL ALSO ADD THAT I LOOKED UP THE DEFINITION OF COMMONS, AND THE DEFINITION IS LITERALLY LAND OWNED JOINTLY BY THE RESIDENTS OF A COMMUNITY, USUALLY A PARK, AND SO WHILE I UNDERSTAND WE ARE GOING TO BE GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS IN RESPONSE TO PROPOSAL A, I'M FINE WITH THAT. I JUST WANT TO LIMIT THE AMOUNT THAT IT COSTS THE TAXPAYER WHILE WE SIT IN LIMBO, AND SO I SUPPORT THIS AMENDMENT.
01:35:50.041: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER NELSON?
01:35:54.679: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  HI. I JUST WANT TO ECHO SOME OF THE SENTIMENTS OF COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER. I SHARE HIS MEMORY OR LACK OF MEMORY ABOUT ANY ELABORATE STORIES OF PHILANTHROPY FUNDING THIS WHOLE THING, AND I DO RECALL THAT WE WERE SPECIFICALLY NOT ALLOWED TO ATTACH A LENGTHY CAPTION AROUND FUNDING FOR PROP A. SO, I GUESS I -- I HAVE A -- I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM PARTICULARLY WITH PUTTING A CEILING ON THIS OF $25,000, BUT I GUESS I HAVE A PROCEDURAL QUESTION ABOUT THE WAY COUNCILMEMBER SMITH FRAMED THIS, I GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT YOU -- THAT IT WAS BEING DESCRIBED AS A BUDGET AMENDMENT, AND IS THIS NOT SOMEWHAT CONNECTED TO OUR UPCOMING BUDGET? AND SORT OF TO ECHO WHAT COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER SAID, I'M NOT UNDERSTANDING HOW THERE IS A RISK OF THIS EXPANDING INTO AN EXPENDITURE THAT'S BEYOND $25,000 ANYWAY. SO I GUESS MAYBE THAT'S MY QUESTION FOR MR. LAZARUS.
01:37:20.665: >> CITY ADMIN. LAZARUS:  IT'S MY BELIEF WHAT WE ARE DOING WITH THIS RESOLUTION, IT WOULD START TO ACCRUE FUNDS FOR FUTURE DESIGN AND IMPROVEMENTS. IT DOESN'T AUTHORIZE ANY EXPENDITURES THAT WOULD VIOLATE THE COUNCIL'S POLICIES OR THE CITY ORDINANCES ON HOW WE BUY THINGS, SO IT'S AN ALLOCATION OF FUNDS IN THE FUTURE BUDGET.
01:37:44.089: >> SO IS THERE --
01:37:47.859: >> CITY ADMIN. LAZARUS:  WHAT THIS RESOLUTION DIRECTS, IT SAYS WE ARE PUTTING PARKING REVENUE ASIDE FOR FUTURE -- FOR FUTURE USE.
01:37:58.169: >> SO WAS THE --
01:37:59.237: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER NELSON, YOU STILL HAVE THE FLOOR.
01:38:02.207: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  IS THERE ANY SUBSTANTIVE REASON TO EVEN PUT THE CEILING OF $25,000 IN THERE AT ALL THEN?
01:38:08.780: >> CITY ADMIN. LAZARUS:  THE $25,000 I THINK ADDRESSES PROCUREMENTS. WHICH IS DIFFERENT THAN ESTABLISHING A FUND FOR FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS. IT DOES AFFECT FUTURE BUDGETS IN THAT PARKING REVENUES FROM DDA GO INTO THE GENERAL FUND. WHETHER WE REDUCE THAT FUNDING FROM HOW DDA ACCOUNTS FOR THE FUNDS, OR IF IT'S FUNDING THAT IS PART OF THE 20% OF REVENUES THAT WE GET, IT STILL DECREASES FUNDING THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE IN THE GENERAL FUND IN FUTURE BUDGET YEARS.
01:38:43.381: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  THANK YOU.
01:38:44.549: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI -- I'M SORRY. COUNCILMEMBER NELSON?
01:38:47.485: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  I'M DONE.
01:38:48.820: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, GRAND, EATON.
01:38:53.892: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  THANK YOU. YOU KNOW, I -- THIS IS DEFINITELY OBVIOUSLY A CONTENTIOUS ISSUE. IT CONTINUES TO BE A CONTENTIOUS ISSUE. WE ALL HAVE DIFFERENT TAKES ON WHAT THE VOTERS THOUGHT WHEN THEY VOTED FOR THIS. I HAVE A TAKE. I THINK THE VOTERS TURNED DOWN A MANIPULATED PROCESS TO TAKE PUBLIC ASSETS FOR PRIVATE GAIN. THAT'S WHAT THE VOTERS, IN MY OPINION, SAID WITH THIS. THEY DIDN'T TURN DOWN $5 MILLION FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THEY TURNED DOWN A MANIPULATED PROCESS. I HAVE A QUESTION WITH THE FUNDING. IT'S STILL -- IT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME, THIS $273,000, HOW IT IS RETROACTIVE AND HOW IT AFFECTS OUR GENERAL FUND. IS IT COMING OUT OF THE 20% WE GET OR ON TOP OF THE 20%? AND HOW DID WE COME UP WITH $875 A DAY? THAT SURFACE LOT IS NOT FULL THE ENTIRE DAY. I FIND THAT PROBLEMATIC, HOW WE GOT TO $875 A DAY. THAT WOULD MEAN THOSE SPACES ARE OCCUPIED ALL DAY LONG EVERY DAY, EVERY SPACE. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S THE CASE. IN THE BALLOT LANGUAGE, IT DID NOT DESCRIBE FUNDING SOURCE, SO, YOU KNOW, I THINK IT'S -- I THINK IT'S INCONSISTENT TO APPLY THAT IN THIS CASE. I'LL ALSO AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE, COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER. THE FACT IS THE UTILITIES ARE THERE. I WATCHED THEM LAY THEM DOWN. I WATCHED THEM PUT ALL OF THOSE UTILITIES IN, THE WATER, THE SEWER, THE ELECTRICAL. IT'S ALL THERE. SO, I JUST NEED A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE FINANCIAL IMPACTS. IT'S JUST COMPLETELY UNCLEAR TO ME WHAT THAT MEANS TO OUR GENERAL FUND.
01:41:28.613: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
01:41:29.781: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRAND:  THANK YOU. I JUST WANTED TO SPEAK TO THE PEOPLE QUESTIONING MY MEMORY. THERE IS AN ARTICLE IN MLIVE THAT WAS PUBLISHED A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE VOTE IN 2018, AND IT WAS COVERING A TOWN HALL BETWEEN SUPPORTERS OF BOTH SIDES. SO I JUST WANT TO READ SOMETHING FROM THAT. A TOWNSHIP RESIDENT, ANOTHER MEMBER OF THE CENTRAL PARK GROUP, JOINED HAVER IN ARGUING FOR PROP A, AND THEN HE SPEAKS TO THAT IT WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR DDA FUNDING AND PARKLAND ACQUISITION FUNDS, WHICH ISN'T TRUE BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY OWN IT, BUT THEN HE SAYS, QUOTE, MOST DOWNTOWN PARKS THAT WE HAVE LOOKED AT HAVE SIGNIFICANT SUPPORT FROM PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS AND BUSINESSES. WITH THE GOAL OF DEDICATING A NEW PARK AND CIVIC CENTER IN 2024. WHY THAT DATE, 2024? IT'S ANN ARBOR'S BICENTENNIAL. AND THEN HE SPEAKS TO MANY EXAMPLES OF SUCCESSFUL DOWNTOWN PARKS AND POINTED TO CAMPUS MARSHES PARK IN DETROIT, WHICH IS A PARK THAT IS ALSO PRIVATELY FUNDED. SO WE WEREN'T JUST IMAGINING THIS, THOSE WHO REMEMBER PROMISES OF SUPPORT OF PRIVATE FUNDS. WE HEARD IT AGAIN AND AGAIN. WE HEARD IT FROM WE WERE APPROACHED TO SIGN PETITIONS. WE HEARD IT, FOR THOSE OF US WHO HAVE SAT THROUGH MEETINGS, I HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO THIS ISSUE SINCE I WAS ON THE PARK ADVISORY COMMISSION AND HAVING PROPONENTS OF THIS ISSUE COME FORWARD AND HEARD VERY CONSISTENTLY THAT THIS WAS SUCH A GREAT IDEA THAT FOLKS IN THE COMMUNITY WOULD BE GLADLY OPENING THEIR POCKET BOOKS TO PAY FOR IT. SO I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE MAY BE DIFFERENCES IN TERMS OF HOW WE THINK THIS PROJECT SHOULD BE FUNDED, BUT I DON'T APPRECIATE BEING ACCUSED OF NOT REMEMBERING WHAT I HEARD.
01:43:38.643: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
01:43:41.045: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  THANK YOU. SO WITH THE PASSAGE OF PROPOSAL A, THE VOTERS CHANGED THE CITY CHARTER TO DESIGNATE THIS PROPERTY AS PUBLIC SPACE. IT'S NO LONGER PARKING. ITS CURRENT USE AS PARKING IS ACTUALLY SUBORDINATE TO THE CITY CHARTER. AS REFLECTED IN THE SEPTEMBER 23RD MEMO FROM THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR ON THE INTERIM USE OF THIS SPACE, HE RECOMMENDED USING THE ACCRUED FUNDS FROM PARKING REVENUES ON THE SURFACE LOT.
01:44:18.449: >> YES, RIGHT, CORRECT.
01:44:21.386: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  THIS RESOLUTION DRAWS ON THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR'S SEPTEMBER 23RD MEMORANDUM FOR THE INTERIM USES OF THIS PROPERTY. IT'S NOT VERBATIM. I AM NOT SUGGESTING THAT HE USED THE SAME CALCULATION THAT THE RESOLUTION DOES, BUT IT DRAWS SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE RECOMMENDATIONS HE MADE. I DIDN'T JUST MAKE THIS UP, AND I DON'T THINK IT'S DISINGENUOUS TO TAP INTO THOSE FUNDS THAT ARE COLLECTED FROM THE PUBLIC SPACE THAT THE RESIDENTS WANT USED FOR PUBLIC PURPOSES OTHER THAN PARKING. I DON'T SEE ANY ANOMALY IN THAT. SO I'M NOT GOING TO SUPPORT THE $25,000 CAP. I THINK THAT WE SHOULD GO THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS AND DETERMINE WHAT INTERIM USES ARE GOING TO COST ON THIS SPACE. WE SHOULD WORK WITH OUR PARTNERS, SUCH AS THE DDA, AND THE PARKS DEPARTMENT, TO ACTIVATE THESE PROPERTIES, BUT UNTIL WE HAVE A PLAN FOR INTERIM USES, WE WON'T KNOW THOSE EXPENSES, AND SO I THINK IT'S PREMATURE TO PLACE A CAP ON SPENDING BEFORE WE HAVE A PLAN. THANK YOU.
01:45:37.795: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
01:45:40.465: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR, AND THANK YOU COUNCILMEMBER EATON. I APPRECIATE YOUR POINTING THAT THIS WAS AN OPTION. THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR MEMO, THE SEPTEMBER 23RD MEMO, IDENTIFIED THREE OPTIONS. OPTION ONE WAS CONSIDER PARKING REVENUE IN A DEDICATED ACCOUNT, AND RECOMMENDED PURSUING MODIFIED OPTION ONE THROUGH THE END OF FISCAL YEAR '20, BEGIN TO APPROVE FUNDS EQUIVALENT TO PARKING REVENUES, PARKING ALTERNATIVES. SO THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THAT RECOMMENDATION, AND SO I APPLAUD COUNCILMEMBER EATON FOR PROPOSING SOMETHING THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR'S FUNDING RECOMMENDATION, AND I KNOW THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR HAS ALSO ASSIGNED HIS ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ADVISOR TO ASSIST WITH WITH THIS PROJECT AND PRESUMABLY WITH FUND-RAISING, AND I WOULD CERTAINLY HOPE THAT THE DDA WOULD WANT TO, IF NOTHING ELSE, TAKE A LEAD ROLE AND WORK WITH THE TASK FORCE AND OTHERS WHO ARE TRYING TO PURSUE ACTIVATING THIS SITE IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH WHAT OUR RESIDENTS ADVISE THAT WE DO. SO I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING THE AMENDMENT EITHER. WHAT IS PROPOSED HERE IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WAS RECOMMENDED IN THAT SEPTEMBER 23RD MEMO FROM THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR.
01:47:30.841: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  I GUESS I WOULD SAY A COUPLE OF THINGS. WE DON'T HAVE -- LIKE I SAID, WE DON'T HAVE CONTROL OVER THE DDA BUDGET. WE GET PARKING REVENUE FROM THE DDA, AND IT COMES TO US FROM -- BY VIRTUE OF THE PARKING CONTRACT. IF WE CHOOSE TO USE SOME OF THAT PARKING REVENUE AND ALLOCATE THAT FOR THIS PURPOSE OR THAT PURPOSE, THAT'S COUNCIL'S DECISION, BUT MAKE NO MISTAKE, WE CURRENTLY USE ALL OF THAT MONEY FOR THE GENERAL FUND. SO IF WE GET OUR $1.1 MILLION PER YEAR, IF WE GET OUR $1.1 MILLION PER YEAR FROM THE PARKING CONTRACT, OUR 20% CUT FROM THE PARKING SYSTEM, A PORTION OF THAT COMES FROM THE LIBRARY LANE PARKING STRUCTURE. IF WE WERE TO INTERNALLY SEGREGATE SOME OF THAT FOR THIS PURPOSE, THAT'S OUR DECISION, AND THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE ADMINISTRATOR'S RECOMMENDATION, BUT THAT IS GENERAL FUND MONEY THAT IS NO LONGER USED FOR OTHER GENERAL FUND PURPOSES, AND WE SHOULD RECOGNIZE THAT. FURTHER, THERE IS NO CAP TO THE RESOLUTION AS DRAFTED. IT'S A RUNNING TAB OF $875 PER DAY, WHICH IS MONEY THAT WE WOULD OTHERWISE BE USING IN OUR GENERAL FUND THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE POTENTIALLY SETTING ASIDE FOR THIS, YOU KNOW, IN MY VIEW ILL-DEFINED PURPOSE. FURTHER, WITH RESPECT TO THE UTILITIES, I GUESS I WOULD SAY A COUPLE OF THINGS. ONE, DON'T BLAME -- YOU KNOW, THE WORD UTILITY SERVICES IS IN THIS RESOLUTION. IT IS DIRECTING THE ADMINISTRATOR TO PLAN AND FUND IMPROVEMENTS TO THE CENTER OF THE CITY THAT MAY INCLUDE UTILITY SERVICES. AND I UNDERSTAND THAT WE DON'T NEED TO RUN WIRE AND CONDUIT TO THE PARKING STRUCTURE, BUT THERE IS ELECTRICITY AND WASTEWATER. ONE CAN IMAGINE ELECTRICITY, WATER, AND WASTEWATER BEING USED AT THE SURFACE LEVEL, WHERE ANY COMMONS INFRASTRUCTURE WOULD RESIDE, AND THAT WORK IS NOT YET COMPLETED. THOSE CONNECTIONS ARE NOT YET PRESENT, AND THOSE CONNECTIONS WILL COST. I DON'T KNOW IF WE ARE DONE WITH THE AMENDMENT OR NOT. I GUESS I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE ARE, BUT COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
01:49:42.139: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  JUST BRIEFLY, THE BULLET POINTS IN THE LAST RESOLVED CLAUSE ARE LIFTED ALMOST DIRECTLY FROM THE SEPTEMBER 23RD MEMO, INCLUDING THE UTILITIES SERVICES. THIS IS NOT THINGS I'M MAKING UP ON MY OWN. I DREW EXTENSIVELY FROM THE SEPTEMBER 23RD MEMO. THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY. THANK YOU.
01:50:05.830: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER NELSON. PARDON ME, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THIS IS ON THE AMENDMENT.
01:50:14.705: >> CLERK BEAUDRY:  COUNCILMEMBER NELSON?

01:50:33.457: >> CLERK BEAUDRY:  COUNCILMEMBER EATON?
01:50:34.291: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  NO.
01:50:34.992: >> CLERK BEAUDRY:  MOTION FAILS.
01:50:36.360: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION ON THE MAIN MOTION AS WAS? COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN?
01:50:40.331: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. LIKE I SAID, I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THIS VISION OF AN INTERIM USE OR AN INTERMEDIATE USE FOR THIS SITE. I THINK YOU LOOK TO SOME THINGS THAT ROY LOKE HAS DONE TO ACTIVATE SURFACE LEVEL PARKING LOTS, AND THINGS LIKE THESE RECOMMENDATIONS HAVE WORKED WELL THERE. SO WHEN I LOOK AT A SURFACE PARKING LOT AND I LOOK AT WHAT THIS PROPOSES THAT SURFACE PARKING LOT COULD BE, THIS SEEMS BETTER, AND IF I'M CHOOSING BETWEEN A AND B AND THIS IS B, I'M GOING TO CHOOSE B. THAT SAID, I THINK IT'S MY RESPONSIBILITY TO DO ALL THAT WE CAN TO GET A FAIR SHAKE FOR THE TAXPAYER IN THE PRODUCTION OF THESE IDEAS, AND WHATEVER THE LONG-TERM PLAN ENDS UP BEING. THAT'S WHY I SUPPORTED A LIMIT OF $25,000. I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S FAIR TO THE TAXPAYER, AND I THINK, TWO, THAT WE NEED TO LIMIT THE IMPACT TO OUR GENERAL FUND OF LONG-TERM PLANNING BEFORE WE KNOW WHAT MAY BE OR COULD BE. AND SO, WITH THAT, I'LL ALSO MOVE AN AMENDMENT TO STRIKE THE SECOND RESOLVED CLAUSE.
01:51:55.239: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  IS THERE A SECOND? SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER SMITH. DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN, YOU STILL HAVE THE FLOOR.
01:52:02.713: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN: THAT'S ALL. I'M HAPPY TO HEAR FROM COLLEAGUES.
01:52:05.549: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE AMENDMENT? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:52:14.825: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  I GUESS THIS IS A QUESTION FOR OUR CITY ADMINISTRATOR. WHAT WILL THAT HAVE ON THE EFFECT OF THIS RESOLUTION, IF THAT WAS TO BE TAKEN OUT? WHAT BEARING WILL THAT HAVE ON THE EXECUTION OF THIS RESOLUTION?
01:52:29.573: >> CITY ADMIN. LAZARUS:  THE SECOND RESOLVED CLAUSE WOULD CAUSE US TO GO BACK IN TIME AND FIND MONEYS THAT $875 A DAY, STARTING IN LAST NOVEMBER, SO IT D BE A BUDGET IMPACT AT SOME POINT OF FINDING THAT MONEY SOMEWHERE. THE $875, JUST TO ANSWER THE QUESTION YOU ASKED BEFORE, IS THE COST ESSENTIALLY TO RENT THE SPACE. THAT ASSUMES FULL USE. AS YOU STATED, THAT REVENUE IS NOT REALIZED EVERY DAY, SO IN THE MEMORANDUM THAT I SENT IN SEPTEMBER, IT MENTIONED -- IT RAISED THE ISSUE OF WHETHER COUNCIL WANTED TO DEDICATE SOME OF THE FUNDING THAT WOULD BE ON A GO-FORWARD BASIS AS PART OF THE BUDGET PLANNING FOR FY '21. THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY COST TO EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS, BUT GIVEN THAT COUNCIL -- AND I CAN GIVE YOU MY REASONING FOR THAT. GIVEN THAT COUNCIL EMBODIED A CITIZEN TASK FORCE TO COME UP WITH PLANS, I THINK WE CAN REASONABLY ENVISION THERE WILL BE SOME PROFESSIONAL COSTS AND SOME SMALL PROCUREMENT COSTS TO BOTH ENVISION A LONG-TERM USE AND THEN THE INTERIM USE. SO, ABSENT ANY FUNDING, I DON'T KNOW THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO EXECUTE WHAT CAME OUT OF THE TASK FORCE. SO THAT WAS THE REASON BEHIND OFFERING A RECOMMENDATION TO START ACCRUING FUNDS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT. THE RESOLVED CLAUSE, THOUGH, AS IT'S WRITTEN WOULD CAUSE US TO HAVE TO GO BACK AND FIND FUNDS TO SET ASIDE, AND THAT WOULD TAKE AWAY FROM FUNDS THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE IN FY '21 AS BEYOND WHAT WOULD BE SET ASIDE FROM A PORTION OF THE PARKING REVENUES. THANK YOU.
01:54:23.287: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
01:54:24.822: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  THANK YOU. SO HAVING JUST GONE THROUGH THE AUDIT PROCESS, I NOTE THAT THE DDA PARKING FUND HAS A SUBSTANTIAL RESERVE ACCOUNT THAT INCLUDES THE MONEY -- THE REVENUE FROM THIS PARTICULAR SPOT SINCE NOVEMBER. SO, I DON'T KNOW THAT THIS WOULD HAVE ANY IMPACT AT ALL ON OUR BUDGET AT ALL. THE CITY OWNS THE PARKING SPACES, AND THE DDA MANAGES THEM ON OUR BEHALF, BUT THOSE MONEYS ARE OURS, AND I RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S A PARKING AGREEMENT. BUT HAD WE TAKEN THIS PARKING LOT OUT OF THE SYSTEM AS OF THE PASSAGE OF PROPOSAL A, THOSE REVENUES WOULD NOT HAVE ACCRUED TO THE DDA TO BEGIN WITH. SO, I DON'T THINK THIS IS GOING TO CAUSE ANYBODY HARDSHIP, BUT I -- YOU KNOW, I AM NOT SURE IT IS WORTH DEBATING. I WOULD BE WILLING TO SET A DIFFERENT DATE OF BEGINNING THE ACCRUAL, IF IT'S MORE AMENABLE TO MY COLLEAGUES, WE COULD SET IT AS JANUARY 1ST OF 2020 RATHER THAN NOVEMBER OF LAST YEAR. THANK YOU.
01:55:46.270: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE AMENDMENT? COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
01:55:50.808: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  I APPRECIATE THAT COUNCILMEMBER EATON JUST BROUGHT UP THE DDA AUDIT THAT THE AUDIT COMMITTEE -- I'M ALSO ON THE AUDIT COMMITTEE -- JUST REVIEWED, AND THAT ALSO -- THE DDA IS WELL-FUNDED. IN FACT, I DON'T THINK THEY CAN SPEND ALL OF THE MONEY THAT THEY HAVE SITTING IN THEIR ACCOUNTS, AND SO THIS IS NOT GOING TO CAUSE ANY SORT OF HARDSHIP TO THE DDA. AGAIN, I THINK THE DDA WOULD WANT TO TAKE A LEAD FINANCIAL SUPPORTING POSITION AND STEP UP. I ALSO -- YOU'LL RECALL AT THE BUDGET RETREAT I SUGGESTED ONE OF MY METRICS WAS THAT THEDDA, IN LIGHT OF LOOKING AT THEIR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CONSIDER GOING FORWARD PROVIDING THE CITY A DIVIDEND OF SOME SORT, AND I DO THINK WHEN WE START UP OUR BUDGET DISCUSSIONS THAT I'M GOING TO BE PUSHING FOR THAT, BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE CAPACITY, AND THAT'S A HUGE UNDERSTATEMENT, AND SO I -- YOU KNOW, AGAIN, I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THE DDA WOULD WANT TO DO, AND THIS IS A LOGICAL PLACE FOR THEM TO MAKE AN INVESTMENT. UNLESS THEY ARE REALLY NOT ON BOARD WITH THE CENTER OF THE CITY AS IT'S NOW PROPOSED.
01:57:23.734: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN, I BELIEVE.
01:57:27.204: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. ON OUR BEHALF, THE DOWNTOWN DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY MANAGES AND PROVIDES MAINTENANCE ON SOME OF OUR MOST EXPENSIVE INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT INFRASTRUCTURE IS OFTEN CONSTRUCTED THROUGH DEBT AND THEN PAID OFF OVER TIME. MAINTENANCE IS USUALLY PERFORMED, YOU KNOW, ON A REGULAR BASIS TO KEEP THESE IN TIP-TOP SHAPE, SAFE, AND ACCESSIBLE TO ALL USERS. WE CAN SAVE OUR MONEY AND SPEND THE REVENUE ON MAINTAINING THIS EXPENSIVE INFRASTRUCTURE, OR WE CAN SPEND THAT MONEY DOWN ON A PARK ON TOP OF AN UNDERGROUND PARKING STRUCTURE, AND THEN BORROW MORE MONEY TO MAINTAIN THE STRUCTURES THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE. I'M OF THE OPINION THAT WE SHOULD USE PARKING REVENUE TO PAY FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF OUR PARKING STRUCTURES, SO IT'S A SELF-SUSTAINING SYSTEM. I'LL ALSO ADD THAT AS WE EXPLORE MOVING OUR COMMUNITY TO CARBON NET NEUTRAL IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS, THERE ARE GOING TO BE INCREDIBLY HEAVY ASKS OF OUR DOWNTOWN PARKING STRUCTURES TO SWITCH TO E.V. -- ELECTRIC VEHICLE -- AND TO PROVIDE SOLAR PANELS ATOP THEM. THOSE NEED TO BE FUNDED SOMEHOW, AND WE CAN BORROW THAT MONEY OR WE CAN USE MONEY THAT WE HAVE BEEN SAVING DILIGENTLY. I'M OF THE OPINION THAT WE SHOULD USE MONEY THAT WE HAVE BEEN SAVING TO FUND AS MUCH OF THOSE IMPROVEMENTS AS POSSIBLE, NOT TO MENTION THE LONG-TERM MAINTENANCE OF THESE STRUCTURES. I WOULD PREFER THAT ANY AND ALL PARKING REVENUE THAT DOESN'T COME INTO THE CITY'S GENERAL FUND GO BACK INTO MAINTAINING EXPENSIVE INFRASTRUCTURE, AND SO I WOULD NOT LIKE TO SEE ANY OF THIS MONEY ACCRUED TO FUND AN EXPENSIVE AND FANCIFUL PARK.
01:59:25.922: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:59:27.624: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  I'M STILL CONFUSED AT THIS $875 A DAY, WHETHER THAT COMES OUT OF THE 20% THAT WE GET, OR IS THAT IN ADDITION TO? BECAUSE IF THE CITY CHARTER WAS CHANGED, THAT PROPERTY SHOULD NOT BE COUNTED TOWARDS THE 20% IN PARKING REVENUE THAT WE GET. I MEAN, IT JUST SEEMS LIKE WE ARE CONFLATING A FEW THINGS HERE, AND THAT MONEY THAT'S SET ASIDE SHOULD BE IN ADDITION TO THE 20% THAT WE GET ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. IF I CAN GET SOME CLARIFICATION FROM THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR, I'M JUST NOT SURE WHETHER -- AND THIS MAY BE A LEGAL QUESTION -- ON WHETHER THAT MONEY SHOULD BE COMING OUT OF THE 20% OR IT SHOULD BE ON TOP OF THE 20%.
02:00:22.746: >> CITY ADMIN. LAZARUS:  THE CHARTER AMENDMENT SETS ASIDE THE SPACE BOUNDED BY 5th AVENUE, WILLIAM, DIVISION, AND LIBERTY AS A CENTRAL PARK AND URBAN COMMONS. I THINK THAT'S THE LANGUAGE THAT'S IN THERE. THAT'S ALL IT SAYS. IT'T MAKE ANY REFERENCE TO FUNDING. THE FUNDING THAT THE CITY RECEIVES FROM THE DDA, WHICH WAS INCREASED, I THINK, TWO AND A HALF YEARS AGO FROM 17 TO 20% IS OUR SHARE OF THE PARKING REVENUES. THAT'S WHAT WE GET. THE 875 IS THE NUMBER THAT I DIDN'T RECOMMEND. IT WAS ONE THAT WAS IN THE DRAFT. IT'S A CHARGE FOR USE OF THAT SPACE FROM A THIRD PARTY WHO WANTS TO USE IT. THE RESOLVED CLAUSE DIRECTS THAT WE'LL WORK WITH THE DDA TO RECOVER OR REPLACE THE REVENUE FOR THE PURPOSE, SO I THINK THAT MEANS THAT I'M GOING TO GO BACK TO DDA AND TALK TO THEM ABOUT HOW WE PUT THE FUNDS ASIDE FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PROPERTY. THE WAY IT'S WRITTEN, I THINK IT GIVES ME ENOUGH LATITUDE TO HAVE FRUITFUL CONVERSATIONS WITH MS. PALE AND HER TEAM TO COME BACK TO COUNCIL AND START A PLAN ON HOW WE ARE GOING TO ACCRUE FUNDING. I'M COMFORTABLE WITH THAT. THE MEMO THAT I SENT IN SEPTEMBER WAS CIRCULATED TO SEVERAL PARTIES, THE LIBRARY, AS WELL AS THE DDA FOR THEIR INPUT. SO THERE'S NOTHING IN THERE THAT THEY HAVEN'T SEEN BEFORE. SO WITH PASSAGE OF THE RESOLUTION AS IT IS WRITTEN, I WOULD GO BACK AND TALK TO MS. POLLE, AND THEN AS THE COUNCIL'S REPRESENTATIVE ON THE DDA BOARD, I WOULD BRING A PROPOSAL FOR THEM TO CONSIDER HOW TO MAKE FUNDING AVAILABLE.
02:02:13.390: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  THANK YOU.
02:02:14.391: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
02:02:15.892: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRAND:  THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THE RECOGNITION THAT THERE'S NOTHING IN THE CHARTER AMENDMENT, AS I LOOK AT IT, THAT SPEAKS TO FUNDING. I ALSO WANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT AS WE ARE MOVING FORWARD ON SOME PRIORITIES THAT I HEAR FROM RESIDENTS THAT ARE PLACED MUCH HIGHER THAN BUILDING ANOTHER PARK ON TOP OF A PARKING STRUCTURE, THINGS LIKE AFFORDABLE HOUSING, THINGS LIKE, YOU KNOW, GOING FORWARD ON PROGRAMS THAT SPEAK TO THE CLIMATE EMERGENCY THAT WE JUST PASSED, THE DDA COMES UP IN A LOT OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS AS WELL, AS WE LOOK TO PUT HOUSING ON TOP OF SOME OF OUR CITY-OWNED PROPERTIES THAT ARE -- THAT WE PASSED JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO, THE DDA COMES UP IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS BECAUSE THOSE PROPERTIES ARE IN THE DOWNTOWN. SO, PERSONALLY, I WOULD MUCH RATHER SEE US MAKE THAT ASK, IF THE DDA TRULY HAS MONEY THAT IT JUST DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO SPEND. I WOULD RATHER SEE IT GO THERE THAN SEE IT GO TO SOMETHING THAT HASN'T EVEN BEEN RECOMMENDED BY A TASK FORCE YET. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO READ JUST ONE MORE QUOTE FROM A DIFFERENT ARTICLE, THIS TIME FROM AN INTERVIEW ON WEMU, WHERE IT SAYS ALAN HAVER SAYS THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS FOR FUNDING, SO WHEN WE TALKED TO THE ANN ARBOR COMMUNITY FOUNDATION, THEY SOUNDED VERY INTERESTED. IF YOU GET APPROVAL, COME TALK TO US. SIMILARLY, THE ROTARY CLUB AND SIMILARLY WITH OTHER FOUNDATIONS AND RICH INDIVIDUALS WITH WHOM I HAVE TALKED.
02:03:49.486: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE ASSESSMENT? ROLL CALL -- COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
02:03:53.156: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  JUST A HOT TOPIC FROM THE AUDIT COMMITTEE AND THE DDA'S AUDIT, THEY HAVE $7.5 MILLION IN UNASSIGNED FUNDS. THEIR NET POSITION INCREASED ALMOST 14% THIS YEAR. THEY RAISED AND SET ASIDE $4 MILLION IN PARKING, MORE THIS YEAR THAN LAST YEAR. WE ARE ARGUING OVER PENNIES RELATIVE TO THE DDA'S TOTAL BUDGET AND TOTAL EXCESS OF UNASSIGNED FUNDS THAT THEY HAVE. THEY HAVE EVEN MORE IN UNENCUMBERED FUNDS FOR PROJECTS THAT WHO KNOWS WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO BE. THERE'S ENOUGH FOR EVERYBODY HERE. THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM FOR SOLAR PANELS AND EVERYTHING HERE. WE ARE NOT EVEN ASKING FOR ANYTHING. WE ARE JUST TALKING ABOUT HAVING THE ADMINISTRATOR POTENTIALLY ASKING THEM. READ THE AUDIT REPORT ABOUT THE AMOUNT THAT THE DDA HAS BEEN SOCKING AWAY, AND IT GROWS EVERY YEAR. THE TREND LINE, NOT FOR ME, BUT THE CITY, WE HAVE SET OURSELVES UP TO REQUIRE CONTINUOUS GROWTH AND CONTINUOUS DEVELOPMENT TO PAY FOR OUR $550 MILLION IN PENSION OBLIGATIONS AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT WE HAVE GOING AS A CITY, SO THE DDA WILL CONTINUE TO GET THEIR SLICE, AND THE REST WILL GO INTO THE GENERAL FUND WHERE IT SHOULD BE. THERE'S PLENTY OF MONEY HERE, AND I DON'T THINK THIS IS A SQUANDERING OF ANYTHING. IT'S A REACH TO THINK THAT WE ARE HURTING THE POOR DDA, BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT POOR. THEY ARE NOT POOR, AND THE CFR TELLS AN EVEN BETTER STORY ABOUT HOW MUCH MONEY WE HAVE SOCKED AWAY. I KNOW OUR PENSION LIABILITIES ARE VERY HIGH, AND I WOULD LOVE TO PAY DOWN SOME OF THESE BONDS, AND I KNOW THAT PARKING, WE HAVE THESE REVENUE BONDS, AND WE HAVE TRADITIONAL BONDS, AND THANK YOU TO MR. CRAWFORD FOR SHUFFLING THIS AROUND AND EVEN IMPROVING THEIR POSITION EVEN MORE AND REDUCING THE CITY'S DEBT EVEN MORE. THANK YOU.
02:05:48.138: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE AMENDMENT? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
02:05:54.477: >> JUST A CLARIFICATION. THE AMENDMENT THAT WE ARE VOTING ON IS TO STRIKE THE SECOND RESOLVED CLAUSE?

02:06:28.912: >> COUNCILMEMBER SMITH:  YOU KNOW, I THINK -- I DON'T KNOW THAT -- SITTING ON THE CENTER OF THE CITY TASK FORCE WITH COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT THE WORK THAT THAT COMMITTEE IS DOING IS OUTSTANDING. THE OUTREACH THAT THEY HAVE DONE HAS BEEN VERY GOOD. I THINK MY -- I'M NOT GOING TO SUPPORT THIS, NOT BECAUSE I DISAGREE WITH THE IDEA OF A COMMONS ON THIS SITE OR THAT I DON'T THINK THAT THERE IS A WAY TO FIGURE OUT HOW THIS BLOCK WORKS TO INCORPORATE THE COMMON SPACE. YOU KNOW, I JUST LOOK AT IT AS I DO EXPECT THE DDA TO TAKE A LEAD ROLE IN THIS. IT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE DDA PLAN AND WHAT THEY TRIED TO ACCOMPLISH. I THINK IT'S REASONABLE TO WANT THAT REPORT BEFORE WE MAKE COMMITMENTS. I MEAN, AS SOON AS I SAW THE LINE, THE RESOLVED CLAUSE IN HERE ABOUT, YOU KNOW, SEEK TO OBTAIN EASEMENTS, YOU KNOW, THAT'S NOT A SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY, AND BEING THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT LOTS OF DIFFERENT PROPERTY OWNERS, SOME PUBLIC, SOME PRIVATE, SOME QUASI PUBLIC, IT'S COMPLICATED. SO I APPRECIATE WHAT THIS IS TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH. I JUST WISH, YOU KNOW, WE COULD WAIT UNTIL THAT FINAL REPORT GETS DELIVERED IN FEBRUARY SO THAT WE HAVE SOME MORE CLARITY AS TO WHICH WAY WE ARE GOING ON THIS. THANK YOU.
02:07:56.666: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? THE MAIN MOTION, COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN?
02:08:00.570: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I THINK THIS IS A REASONABLE VISION FOR OUR MIDTERM USE OF THIS SITE. LIKE I HAVE SAID, PLACES LIKE ROYAL OAK HAVE DONE THINGS LIKE THIS, AND IT'S BEEN BENEFICIAL FOR THEIR DOWNTOWN AND THEIR COMMUNITY. IT'S CREATED SPACE FOR COMMUNITY TO MEET, AND I DON'T THINK THOSE ARE BAD THINGS. I'LL BE VOTING AGAINST THIS SIMPLY BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO BE ACCRUING MONEY FOR A PLAN WE DON'T YET HAVE TO THE TUNE OF NEARLY $300,000 A YEAR. I WANT THE DDA LASER-FOCUSED ON ADDRESSING THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS AND ADDRESSING A CLIMATE CRISIS, AND I WANT OUR GENERAL FUND TO BE STABLE AND RESILIENT, SHOULD ECONOMIC HARDSHIP REACH US, BECAUSE THE GENERAL FUND IS RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR SAFETY SERVICES, FOR OUR 2,200 ACRES OF PARK AROUND THE CITY. IT'S RESPONSIBLE FOR THINGS LIKE STREET AND TREE MAINTENANCE, AND IT'S ALL OF THESE THINGS THAT MAKE OUR COMMUNITY SO MUCH GREATER THAN OUTSIDE OF THE DOWNTOWN. SO, FOR ME, IT'S A MATTER OF FUNDING AND PRIORITIES, AND THIS JUST DOESN'T RISE TO THE LEVEL OF PUTTING AWAY BETWEEN 250-$300,000 A YEAR.

02:09:45.375: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  LET'S TAKE A SHORT BREAK. [ GAVEL ]
02:21:53.668: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  WE ARE BACK AFTER A SHORT BREAK. DC2, RESOLUTION STATING THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR'S CONSENT TO REFUGEE SETTLEMENT MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER GRAND. THIS REQUEST FOR THIS COUNCIL ACTUALLY COMES ON THE HEELS OF ACTION BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, OBVIOUSLY. WE ARE ACTING IN RESPONSE TO AN EXECUTIVE ORDER, WHICH DECLINES TO RESETTLE REFUGEES IN JURISDICTIONS THAT DO NOT AFFIRMATIVELY WELCOME THEM. ALTHOUGH THE LANGUAGE OF OUR ACTUAL RESOLUTION IS FAIRLY TAME, I WOULD AT LEAST ON THE FLOOR LIKE TO SAY THAT THE EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT PROMPTS AND REQUIRES THIS RESOLUTION IS SHOCKING AND DISGRACEFUL AND CONTRARY TO EVERYTHING THAT WE AS A NATION OUGHT TO BE AND IN MANY INSTANCES HAVE BEEN. THAT IS TO SAY, A HAVEN FOR THOSE WHO ARE IN NEED, A REFUGE FOR THOSE WHO ARE OPPRESSED, AND IT IS -- JUST IT IS A NATIONAL DISGRACE AND OUR ENDURING SHAME THAT IT HAS COME TO THIS. AND SO I BELIEVE THAT THE RESIDENTS OF THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR ARE IN FULL -THROATED SUPPORT FOR THE RESETTLEMENT OF REFUGEES AND IMMIGRANTS OF ALL KINDS IN OUR COMMUNITY, AND FOR MYSELF, I AM CONFIDENT, AND FOR MY COLLEAGUES, THAT WE WILL DO ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING WE CAN TO DECLARE THEM WELCOME AND ENSURE THAT THEY ARE SO. WE HAVE SO MANY MEMBERS IN OUR COMMUNITY WHO DO GOOD AND ENDURING AND DIFFICULT WORK ON BEHALF OF PEOPLE WHO COME HERE UNDER THESE CONDITIONS, AND I AND WE ARE VERY PROUD OF WHAT THEY DO AND SEEK IN ALL INSTANCES TO SUPPORT THEM. FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER EATON?
02:23:56.058: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES WHO BROUGHT THIS FORWARD, AND I WOULD LIKE TO ADD MY NAME AS A COSPONSOR, PLEASE.
02:24:03.198: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN?
02:24:04.233: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR AND THANK YOU TO THE COLLEAGUES WHO BROUGHT THIS FORWARD. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A COSPONSOR. AS A SMALL PERSONAL NOTE, I COME FROM, YOU KNOW, FOUR FAMILIES, ALL OF WHOM WERE REFUGEES OF ONE FORM OR ANOTHER, MOST RECENTLY JEWISH REFUGEES FROM RUSSIAN POGRAMS THAT GOT TO SETTLE IN A BIG 10 COLLEGE TOWN 100 MILES SOUTH OF HERE IN THE 1820S, AND THEY WERE GIVEN A NEW LIFE TO ALLOW AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MY GRANDPARENTS, MY FATHER AND HIS SISTER TO THRIVE, AND NOW FOR ME TO GIVE BACK TO THE COUNTRY THAT THEY ADOPTED AS THEIR OWN. SO OF COURSE WE SHOULD THROW OUR DOORS OPEN, AND EVERY COMMUNITY AROUND THE COUNTRY SHOULD THROW THEIR DOORS OPEN TO THOSE IN NEED. I GET TO TRAVEL IN MY DAY JOB, AND I TRAVELED TO LANCASTER, PENNSYLVANIA, MOST RECENTLY AND OFTEN TO MINNEAPOLIS, MINNESOTA, TWO COMMUNITIES THAT ACCEPT MORE REFUGEES PER CAPITA THAN MOST OTHER COMMUNITIES, AND THEY HAVE CREATED A BEAUTIFUL MODEL FOR JUST HOW MUCH A CITY IS ENLIVENED AND ENRICHED BY REFUGEES, THROUGH THE DIVERSITY, THROUGH THE LOVE OF AMERICA, THROUGH SHARED FAITH. IT'S A POWERFUL THING, AND SO THANK YOU AGAIN.
02:25:34.223: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
02:25:36.091: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  THANK YOU, AND THANK YOU FOR STAFF IN HELPING CRAFT THIS. I'M LIVING PROOF OF WHAT REFUGEES ARE. MY FATHER CAME TO THIS COUNTRY IN 1962 FOR POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC REASONS. HE HAD TO LEAVE HIS HOME COUNTRY. HE FLED PALESTINE IN 1948, WENT TO JORDAN. MY GRANDFATHER WAS IN DEBTOR'S PRISON. MY FATHER CAME TO THIS COUNTRY TO GET HIS FATHER OUT OF DEBTOR'S PRISON, AND I AM THE AMERICAN DREAM, AND I AM HAPPY TO BE HERE TODAY, ASSEMBLED IN THIS BODY AND COSPONSORING THIS RESOLUTION. IT'S A SAD STATE OF AFFAIRS THAT WE HAVE TO DO THIS, BUT WE WILL FIGHT AGAINST THE HATE THAT'S COMING OUT OF WASHINGTON, AND WE WILL WIN. WE WILL CONQUER THE OPPRESSIVE POLICIES THAT OUR CURRENT PRESIDENT IS PUTN THE MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD, AND IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE IN THIS COMMUNITY THAT WELCOMES IMMIGRANTS AND DIVERSITY IS OUR STRENGTH, AND IT'S NO SECRET TO THE PEOPLE WHO KNOW OF THE STRENGTH IN THIS COUNTRY THAT IT WAS -- IT'S FOUNDED ON PEOPLE WHO HAVE COME FROM ALL PARTS OF THE WORLD, AND I APPRECIATE BEING HERE TODAY AND HAVING MY NAME ASSOCIATED WITH SOMETHING LIKE THIS. THANK YOU.
02:27:26.969: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
02:27:29.905: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER: THANKS, MR. MAYOR. I JUST HAD A QUICK QUESTION. IN THE LETTER THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE SENDING, IF THIS PASSES, IT SAYS THAT WE CONSENT TO INITIAL REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT. I WAS JUST CURIOUS FOR LEGAL, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? I TRIED O LOOK IT UP. I GOT HELP WITH A CATHOLIC AID SOCIETY. DO THEY COME IN AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SAYS THIS IS WHERE YOU GO THE FIRST TIME? IS THAT WHAT THEY MEAN BY INITIAL? THAT'S WHAT IT SAYS, I CONSENT TO INITIAL REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT IN THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR, MICHIGAN. I JUST WONDERED WHAT DID THEY MEAN BY INITIAL.
02:28:15.450: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  I'M AFRAID I DON'T KNOW.
02:28:17.486: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  OKAY. I DON'T KNOW EITHER.
02:28:20.222: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THE LETTER WAS DRAFTED, I BELIEVE, IN CONSULTATION WITH STATE AGENCIES AND LOCAL PROVIDERS. I CAN GET THAT FOR YOU.
02:28:30.899: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  ALL RIGHT. YEAH. IT WASN'T CLEAR. THE CATHOLIC LEGAL IMMIGRATION HAD A PRETTY GOOD RUNDOWN ON IT, TALKING ABOUT THE EXECUTIVE ORDER, BUT THEY DIDN'T DEFINE WHAT THAT REALLY MEANT EITHER, SO IT SEEMED LIKE IT MEANT INITIALLY OUT OF THE FEDERAL VETTING PROCESS, IF SOMEBODY COMES IN HERE AND THEY ARE PICKED UP BY I.C.E. OR SOMETHING AND THEN THEY ARE VETTED IN AND THEY SAY, OKAY, YOU HAVE GOT TO GO SOMEWHERE, THAT'S YOUR INITIAL OR YOUR FIRST PLACEMENT. I ASSUME THAT'S WHAT IT MEANT.
02:29:06.068: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THAT'S MY SUSPICION.
02:29:09.337: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK, JULIE?
02:29:12.874: >> MY UNDERSTANDING, WHAT'S SO ABHORRENT ABOUT THE EXECUTIVE ORDER, IF YOU DON'T HAVE PERMISSION FROM A MUNICIPALITY OR THE STATE, YOU'RE IN LIMBO, SO YOU HAVE NOWHERE YOU CAN GO, SO YOU CAN NOW GO ONLY TO THOSE PLACES THAT SAY THAT YOU ARE SPECIFICALLY WELCOME. THAT'S WHAT IT SPEAKS TO.
02:29:30.892: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  THANK YOU. I WAS JUST CURIOUS ABOUT WHAT WE ARE SENDING OUT THERE.
02:29:33.662: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [ CHORUS OF AYES ] OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. DC3, RESOLUTION TO ENDORSE HB 4738 AND THE CREATION OF A STATEWIDE CROSSWALK LAW MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER EATON, SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM. DISCUSSION OF DC3? COUNCILMEMBER SMITH.
02:29:59.287: >> COUNCILMEMBER SMITH:  SO, JUST AS A POINT OF CLARITY, WHILE I AM LISTED AS A COSPONSOR BECAUSE I AM ON THE COUNCIL POLICY COMMITTEE, I DO NOT SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION. AND LET ME GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND ABOUT WHY. IT'S BEEN POINTED OUT BY LOTS OF FOLKS THAT OUR CROSSWALK LAWS ARE A BIT DIFFERENT THAN SOME OTHER PEOPLE. WHEN THE COUNCIL POLICY COMMITTEE HAD DISCUSSIONS ABOUT ADVOCATING FOR THE CREATION OF A STATE-WIDE CROSSWALK LAW, IT WAS NOT DONE SO WITH THE INTENTION OF CREATING SOMETHING THAT LESSENS OUR OWN CROSSWALK LAW HERE. CERTAINLY, MY SUPPORT FOR A STATE-WIDE CROSSWALK LAW WAS TIED TO THAT CROSSWALK LAW MIRRORING OURS, AND THAT'S NOT WHAT HB 4738 DOES. I WOULD THINK THAT IF WE WANT TO UNDO OUR CROSSWALK LAW, WE DO THAT HERE WITH EIGHT VOTES INSTEAD OF IN LANSING, AND WHILE WE HAVE, AS A CITY, HAVE ADVOCATED FOR A STATE-WIDE CROSSWALK LAW, I WILL CONTINUE TO BE VOCAL WITH MY LEGISLATORS AND THOSE WHO MAKE THIS DECISION THAT I CERTAINLY DO NOT SUPPORT HB 4738. I WOULD ENCOURAGE THIS BODY TO VOTE THIS DOWN THIS EVENING. THANK YOU.
02:31:39.354: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION, PERHAPS? I GUESS I THINK THAT THE -- THERE HAS OBVIOUSLY BEEN DISCUSSION AT THE POLICY COMMITTEE. THERE HAS BEEN DISCUSSION AT THE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE AND I BELIEVE ULTIMATELY AT THE DISABILITY COMMISSION. FOR MY PART, I WOULD BE DELIGHTED IF SOMEONE WOULD BRING FORWARD A MOTION TO CONSIDER TABLING THIS ITEM, ALLOWING PREVIOUSLY -- COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
02:32:09.985: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD:  I WOULD MOVE THAT WE TABLE THIS RESOLUTION UNTIL WE HAVE HIRED A VISION ZERO ENGINEERING EXPERT WHO CAN PROVIDE ACCURATE AND COMPLETE INFORMATION.
02:32:24.466: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  IS THERE A SECOND? SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI. DISCUSSION OF THE TABLING?
02:32:27.802: >> CITY ADMIN. LAZARUS:  SO I OPPOSE THAT LANGUAGE. IF IMPLIES WE DON'T HAVE EXPERTISE ON STAFF. IT DIRECTS ME ON WHO TO HIRE, AND IT IMPLIES THAT WE ARE NOT PROVIDING ACCURATE INFORMATION, SO I OPPOSE THE LANGUAGE BUT NOT THE INTENT.
02:32:44.052: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD?
02:32:45.420: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD:  THAT POSITION IS IN THE BUDGET THAT WE ADOPTED STARTING JULY 1ST OF 2019, AND I DID SEND A EMAIL TODAY STATING THAT THERE WERE INACCURACIES AND INCOMPLETE INFORMATION IN THE RESPONSE TO THE AGENDA QUESTIONS.
02:33:06.775: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE TABLING? ALL IN FAVOR? [ CHORUS OF AYES ] OPPOSED?
02:33:18.820: >> NO.
02:33:19.054: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  DO YOU NEED A ROLL CALL?
02:33:21.723: >> NO.
02:33:24.259: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  IT IS APPROVED WITH 11 COUNCILMEMBERS PRESENT, TEN VOTING IN THE AFFIRMATIVE.
02:33:30.865: >> CITY ADMIN. LAZARUS:  I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT I UNDERSTAND, THAT THIS IS NOT COMING BACK UNTIL WE HAVE HIRED AN EXPERT WITH THE SPECIFIC SKILLS THAT WE MAY OR MAY NOT BE HIRING.
02:33:45.447: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  I'LL LET THE TABLING LANGUAGE SPEAK FOR ITSELF, AND ADDITIONALLY, COUNCILMEMBERS AT VARIOUS TIMES CAN BRING FORWARD VARIOUS RESOLUTIONS IF THEY WISH TO. DC4, RESOLUTIONS TO APPOINT COUNCILMEMBERS BANISTER AND SMITH TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION.
02:34:06.267: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. WE HAVE THREE RESOLUTIONS TONIGHT RELATED TO COUNCILMEMBER APPOINTMENTS TO BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS. THIS FIRST RESOLUTION, DC4, IS TO MAKE COUNCIL APPOINTMENTS TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION. COUNCIL IS VESTED WITH THE AUTHORITY TO MAKE TWO APPOINTMENTS, AND THE RECOMMENDATION IS TO REAPPOINT COUNCILMEMBERS BANISTER AND SMITH. BOTH HAVE SERVED ABLY ON THE COMMISSION, AND I RECOMMEND THAT WE APPOINT THEM FOR ONE YEAR TERMS FOR CALENDAR YEAR 2020.
02:34:36.464: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [ CHORUS OF AYES ] OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. DC5, MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER SMITH. DISCUSSION OF DC 5?
02:34:51.212: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. THE SECOND RESOLUTION IS TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT OF A COUNCILMEMBER TO THE GREENBELT ADVISORY COMMISSION. THE COUNCIL IS VESTED WITH THIS POWER, AND THE RECOMMENDATION HERE IS TO REAPPOINT COUNCILMEMBER GRAND. COUNCILMEMBER GRAND HAS ALSO SERVED FOR SEVERAL YEARS ABLY ON THE GREENBELT ADVISORY COMMISSION, AND I RECOMMEND WE APPROVE COUNCILMEMBER GRAND'S APPOINTMENT FOR THE CALENDAR YEAR 2020.
02:35:22.677: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  ALL IN FAVOR? [ CHORUS OF AYES ] IT IS APPROVED. DC 6 RESOLUTION IN SUPPORT OF EXPANDING THE CITY'S TREE PROTECTION TO INCLUDE HERITAGE TREES COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER?
02:35:36.958: >> COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER: YES. AS I MENTIONED, THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION AND ALSO THE NATURAL FEATURES WORKING GROUP HAS BEEN WORKING REALLY HARD ALL OF 2019 TO LOOK FOR WAYS TO PROTECT OUR HERITAGE TREES AND OTHER TREES WHICH WE ARE DEFINING AS LARGE, IMPORTANT, SIGNIFICANT, AND CHAMPION TREES, AND FOR ALL OF THE GOOD REASONS THAT WE ARE TREE TOWN AND EVERYONE CARES ABOUT OUR TREES. SO WHAT WE HAVE COME TO WITH THIS RESOLUTION IS THAT WE ARE ASKING FOR STAFF ASSISTANCE TO ACCOMPLISH THE DRAFTING OF THE UDC CODE AMENDMENTS AND THE ACTUAL PROCESSING OF THE AMENDMENTS THROUGH OUR SYSTEM, AND SO THIS WOULD ALLOW -- THIS RESOLUTION, WE ARE ASKING FOR YOUR APPROVAL TO ALLOW US SOME STAFF TIME TO HELP US TO EXPEDITIOUSLY MOVE THIS FORWARD SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY BRING YOU OUR BEST WORK, TAKING FROM PEER CITIES AND LOOKING AT ANN ARBOR'S OWN UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS AND TO BRING YOU SOME FURTHER PROTECTIONS FOR OUR LANDMARK TREES THAN WE CURRENTLY HAVE.
02:36:52.967: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
02:36:55.570: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR, AND THANKS TO MY COUNCIL COLLEAGUE AND WARD COLLEAGUE HERE FOR HELPING TO CHAMPION THIS ISSUE. I WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A SPONSOR, IF I COULD, A COSPONSOR. I'M A BIG FAN OF THIS. I THINK THAT IT'S NOT TOO MUCH OF AN ASK TO GET STAFF TO HELP PUT IT TOGETHER PROPERLY, AND I ALSO THINK IT'S A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION OF SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY HAVEN'T DONE HERE AT THE CITY TOO MUCH AND IT IS JUST STARTING TO SORT OF CATCH ON IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD, WHERE THEY ARE STARTING TO TRY AND RECOGNIZE NATURAL RIGHTS AND NATURAL CAPITAL, NATURAL CAPITAL BEING THE VALUE OF THE NATURAL FEATURES AND THE AGGREGATED VALUE OF THE NATURAL FEATURES AND THEIR VALUE TO THE COMMUNITY IN A VARIETY OF WAYS, NOT JUST IN SUSTAINABILITY AND ECOLOGICAL WAYS BUT OTHER WAYS, AND ALSO NATURAL RIGHTS, AS THE -- GENERALLY THE CONCEPT THAT THERE'S NO ONE TO -- CORPORATIONS MIGHT BE PEOPLE, BUT TREES DON'T HAVE RECOGNITION IN THE COURTS AND BODIES OF WATER DON'T HAVE SPECIFIC RECOGNITION IN THE COURTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT, AND SO I JUST THINK THIS IS GOOD TO HAVE A CONVERSATION AROUND THIS TOPIC, AND SO I FULLY SUPPORT THIS, AND I URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO DO THE SAME. THANK YOU.
02:38:06.374: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
02:38:07.375: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD:  I WOULD LIKE TO THANK COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER, COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO PUT IN A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK ON THIS, WHEN THEY FIRST STARTED TALKING ABOUT IT, I DIDN'T REALLY TAKE THEM SERIOUSLY, BUT I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT, AND THE MORE I LEARNED ABOUT IT, THE MORE I REALIZED THAT IT IS CRITICAL FOR OUR COMMUNITY, AND I WOULD LIKE TO BE LISTED AS A COSPONSOR.
02:38:33.134: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
02:38:34.936: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  THANK YOU. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK OUR STAFF, OUR NATURAL FEATURES COMMITTEE AND MY COLLEAGUE, COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER FOR THE WORK THAT THEY HAVE ALREADY PUT INTO THIS, AND I SUPPORT MOVING THIS FORWARD. I THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT WORK, AND I WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A COSPONSOR AS WELL. THANK YOU.
02:38:53.054: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR -- PARDON ME. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
02:39:00.161: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  I WOULD LIKE TO ECHO THE SENTIMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN EXPRESSED AND THANKING THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT, ESPECIALLY SINCE WE HAVE ISSUED A CLIMATE EMERGENCY, THAT WE PUT ALL HANDS ON DECK INTO PROTECTING OUR NATURAL RESOURCES, AND I WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A COSPONSOR AS WELL. THANK YOU.
02:39:18.046: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [ CHORUS OF AYES ] OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. DC7, RESOLUTION TO APPROVE 2020 COUNCIL COMMITTEE APPOINTMENTS MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER. DISCUSSION PLEASE OF DC7. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
02:39:35.263: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. THIS IS THE LAST OF THREE RESOLUTIONS APPOINTING COUNCILMEMBERS TO BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS. THIS ONE, DC7, COVERS APPOINTMENTS TO OVER 40, YES, YOU HEARD THAT RIGHT, OVER 40 BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS. I WON'T READ THROUGH THE LIST, BUT I DO WANT TO THANK MAYOR TAYLOR FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS AND THANK ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES FOR YOUR RESPONSIVENESS AND FOR WORKING TOGETHER ON THIS. I ESPECIALLY APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S UNDERSTANDING THAT IT IS JUST NOT POSSIBLE FOR COUNCILMEMBERS TO GET ON ALL OF THE BOARDS OR COMMISSIONS HE OR SHE MIGHT LIKE. ALSO, WITH 40-PLUS BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS, SUPPORTING ALL OF THEM REQUIRES A SUBSTANTIVE TIME COMMITMENT FROM EVERY COUNCILMEMBER, AND THAT TOO IS GREATLY APPRECIATED. ANYWAY, IN COMPILING THE APPOINTMENT LIST, IT'S MATTER OF TRYING TO ACHIEVE A FAIR BALANCE OF FOLKS' INTERESTS AND PRIORITIES WITH AN EYE ON MAINTAINING CONTINUITY AS WELL. I THINK WE HAVE DONE THAT AND HOPE YOU'LL AGREE AND WILL SUPPORT THESE APPOINTMENTS TONIGHT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION, AND THANKS AS WELL FOR EVERYONE'S HELP IN PULLING THIS TOGETHER.
02:40:36.557: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
02:40:37.425: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  THANK YOU. I FIND MYSELF IN AN ODD SITUATION HERE. I'M ASSIGNED TO A RECREATION ADVISORY COMMISSION, AND I WAS ALSO ASSIGNED TO THAT BEFORE, BUT I HAVE NEVER BEEN TO ONE. I KNOW KATHY HAS BEEN ON THAT, AND I WASN'T SURE IF I'M SUPPOSED TO BE AN ALTERNATE OR WHAT ON THERE. I KNOW I'M ASSIGNED TO IT, BUT I HAVE YET TO ATTEND ONE IN MY ONE YEAR ON COUNCIL, AND SO I AM NOT SURE THAT'S THE ONE FOR ME. I THOUGHT I WASN'T ON THERE. YEAH, SORRY ABOUT THAT. I DIDN'T THINK I WAS ON THERE PREVIOUSLY, AND SO I'M NOT SURE -- IS THAT -- AND YOU HAVE BEEN ATTENDING, THAT'S CORRECT, KATHY? YEAH. BECAUSE THERE'S ONLY REALLY ONE SEAT, SO I THINK IT'S SUPPOSED TO SAY ALTERNATE. I JUST WANTED TO POINT THAT OUT. AND I'M HAPPY TO BE ON HERE, THERE'S A THING ON HERE CALLED WASHTENAW METRO ALLIANCE, WHICH I'M ON WITH COUNCIL WOMAN NELSON, AND I'LL BE FRANK, NOBODY KNOWS WHAT THAT IS. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ONE IN THE LAST SEVEN YEARS. WE TRIED TO DO A LITTLE BIT OF DIGGING UP TO SEE WHAT THAT MEANT, AND APPARENTLY THERE WAS A COUNCILMEMBER ON IT A WHILE BACK, BUT IT SORT OF FADED INTO THE I DON'T KNOW WHAT. SO I HAPPILY ACCEPT THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS APPOINTMENT THAT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING.
02:42:02.243: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  SHOULD THEY CALL UPON YOU, YOU WILL SHOW.
02:42:05.847: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  YEAH, I WILL SERVE IF CHOSEN, BUT I DON'T THINK EITHER ONE OF US HAS INFERRED ANYTHING FROM THAT EVER.
02:42:14.856: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  WE'LL KEEP QUIET IF YOU DO.
02:42:17.024: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  YOU KNOW, IF THERE'S SOMETHING OUT THERE, WE'LL TAKE IT AND MAKE IT OURS, IF WE CAN. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU.
02:42:22.430: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
02:42:23.297: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  THANK YOU. JUST, I TOOK A QUICK LOOK AT IT, AND I JUST REALIZED THAT I'M ON THE URBAN COUNTY EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE AS THE PRIMARY COUNCILMEMBER ASSIGNED. [ OFF MIC ]. I'M SORRY TO THROW THIS AT YOU, BUT I ASKED FOR SOME CHANGES. I STEPPED ASIDE FROM THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION FOR SOME OBVIOUS REASONS, BUT -- [ OFF MIC ] SORRY. I DOUBT THAT I CAN TAKE THAT ONE ON. I APOLOGIZE FOR THE LATE NOTICE ON THIS, BUT I DID NOT ASK TO BE CHANGED IN MY ASSIGNMENT FOR THAT COMMISSION OR COMMITTEE.
02:43:02.770: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER NELSON?
02:43:04.505: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  I THINK I MIGHT KNOW HOW THAT HAPPENED, JANE, IF YOU WERE COPYING AND PASTING FROM A PREVIOUS LIST. ABOUT A MONTH IN, WE SWAPPED, AND I'M NOW THE PRIMARY FOR URBAN COUNTY. AND SO I THOUGHT YOU WERE LOOPED INTO THAT CONVERSATION. MAYBE YOU WEREN'T. MAYBE WE HAPPENED -- MAYBE THAT JUST HAPPENED WITHIN URBAN COUNTY.
02:43:26.694: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  YEAH.
02:43:28.562: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  CAN THAT BE FRIENDLY?
02:43:30.865: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  OKAY.
02:43:31.832: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  YOU GUYS ARE BOTH GOOD WITH THAT?
02:43:34.635: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  YEAH.
02:43:35.303: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  ALL RIGHT. FURTHER DISCUSSION? JUST I WOULD LIKE TO THANK COUNCILMEMBER -- SINCE WE ARE COMPLETED HERE, THANK YOU VERY MUCH, COUNCILMEMBER LUMM. IT IS A LOT OF WORK KEEPING TRACK OF 11 OF US, AND IT IS GOOD TO HAVE THAT DONE AND DONE WELL. SO, THANK YOU. ALL IN FAVOR? [ CHORUS OF AYES ] OPPOSED? THEY ARE APPROVED. DC8, RESOLUTION TO APPOINT SARAH BURCH TO THE INDEPENDENT COMMUNITY POLICE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION (ICPOC) MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD, SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI. DISCUSSION, PLEASE, OF DC8. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
02:44:20.982: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  THANK YOU. AND I WOULD LIKE TO THANK ALSO COUNCILMEMBERS GRAND AND RAMLAWI. THIS APPOINTMENT RECOMMENDATION IS TO THE INDEPENDENT COMMUNITY POLICE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION AND IS SPONSORED BY THE THREE OF US. OUR RECOMMENDATION IS THAT SARAH BURCH BE APPOINTED TO FILL THE VACANCY CREATED WHEN COMMISSIONER ROBIN STEVENS RESIGNED, THE APPOINTMENT THROUGH MAY 21ST, 2022. I WON'T SPEAK FOR OTHERS, BUT I BELIEVE IT IS FAIR TO SAY THAT WE BELIEVE SHE WILL BE A STRONG CONTRIBUTOR TO I.C.P.O.C. AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH HER. THANK YOU, ROBIN, WHEREVER YOU ARE. IN MYVIEW, THE COMMISSION ACCOMPLISHED A LOT IN 2019 AND IS POISED TO ACCELERATE THE PACE OF PROGRESS IN 2020 AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO THAT, AND WE HOPE ALL COUNCILMEMBERS WILL JOIN US IN SUPPORT FOR MS. BURCH TO FILL THE REMAINING TIME IN ROBIN STEVENS SEAT THROUGH MAY 2022.
02:45:35.222: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  I DO APPRECIATE ALL OF THE WORK THAT YOU DID IN COMPILING THOSE NAMES AND THE MUSICAL CHAIRS IN GETTING PEOPLE ASSIGNED ON THE COMMISSIONS AND BOARDS. SPEAKING ON DC8, THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF GREAT W THAT'S BEEN DONE ON THE POLICE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION. SARAH BURCH SCORED HIGH. SHE WAS ONE OF THE ORIGINAL APPLICANTS THAT APPLIED THROUGH THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION. HE WAS ONE OF THE TOP 20 NAMES THAT WE REVIEWED, AND SHE HAS COME HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FROM THE COMMISSION ITSELF, AND THEY ARE SEEKING TO HAVE A FULL BODY TO DO THE WORK THAT'S BEING ASKED TO BE DONE, SO I APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE THROUGHOUT OUR COMMUNITY ON ALL OF THESE BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS, AS THAT'S WHERE A LOT OF THE WORK GETS DONE. THAT'S WHERE A LOT OF THE TIME THAT WE SPEND IN MEETINGS AND GETTING IDEAS HASHED AND RESOLUTIONS AND LEGISLATION BROUGHT FORTH. SO I APPRECIATE EVERYONE THAT SERVES ON THESE BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS. IT'S REALLY -- IT GOES TOO OFTEN UNNOTICED AND UNTHANKED, AND IT IS JUST AN OPPORTUNITY TO THANK EVERYBODY WHO DOES SERVE AS VOLUNTEERS, WHO GIVE UP A LOT OF THEIR TIME TO SERVE THEIR COMMUNITY.
02:47:00.207: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [ CHORUS OF AYES ] OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. DB1, RESOLUTION TO APPROVE HIDEAWAY LANE PLANNED PROJECT SITE PLAN AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT AT 2000 TRAVER ROAD MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN, SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER GRAND. DISCUSSION, PLEASE, OF DB1. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
02:47:22.930: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I WOULD JUST LIKE TO MAKE A GENERAL COMMENT ON THIS, AS IT REFERS TO THE PLANNED PROJECT SITE PLAN, AND I KNOW THAT -- WELL, I DON'T KNOW THIS, BUT I WAS TOLD BY PREVIOUS COUNCILMEMBERS THAT IN THE PAST, COUNCIL WAS GIVEN A BIT OF A TRAINING SESSION ON PLANNING AND ZONING AND THE FUNCTIONS OF THE PLANNING COMMISSION, THE ZBA, MICHIGAN ZONING ENABLING ACT AND SO ON, AND I'M SORRY TO SAY THAT WE DIDN'T RECEIVE THAT, AND SO WE HAVE BEEN PLAYING A LITTLE -- I HAVE BEEN PLAYING A LITTLE CATCH-UP WITH HOW ALL OF THIS STUFF FITS TOGETHER AND HOW IT WORKS. SO THIS MIGHT BE INCORRECT, BUT MY UNDERSTANDING WAS THAT WE HAVE THIS ZONING THAT CREATES SORT OF VOLUMETRIC ENVIRONMENTS, YOU MIGHT SAY, HOW BIG A BUILDING CAN BE, WHERE IT CAN BE IN RELATION TO THE LOT LINES AND SO ON, AND IF YOU FIT THAT ENVELOPE, THEN YOU GET TO BUILD YOUR PROJECT, NO PROBLEM. THAT'S BY RIGHT. AND IF YOU DON'T FIT THE ENVELOPE, YOU ASK FOR A VARIANCE, AND THOSE VARIANCES ARE GRANTED BY THE ZONING BOARD OF REVIEW, WAS MY UNDERSTANDING, NOT CITY COUNCIL, BUT SINCE WE HAVE THIS PLANNED PROJECT NOTION FLOATING AROUND, APPARENTLY CITY COUNCIL HAS TAKEN IT UPON OURSELVES TO APPROVE THESE THINGS OUTSIDE OF ZBA'S PURVIEW, WHICH I AM NOT SURE IS A RESPONSIBILITY THAT RESTS SQUARELY WITH US UNDER THE ZONING ENABLING ACT, AND SO I DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM WITH THIS PROJECT ESPECIALLY, AND THE VARIANCES THAT ARE BEING ASKED FOR ARE -- MIGHT BE CONSIDERED SLIGHT, BUT THERE IS NO HARDSHIP PREVENTING THE DEVELOPER FROM DEVELOPING TO THE VOLUME METRIC REQUIREMENTS FOR THE ZONING FOR THAT SITE, AND SO MY RECOMMENDATION WOULD BE TO REJECT THESE CHANGES AND KICK IT BACK TO ZBA AND LET THEM DECIDE WHETHER IT'S APPROPRIATE OR NOT, AND I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE ON 6/16, WHICH IS WHY I REJECTED THAT NOTION ALSO. AND I'LL SAY THIS ABOUT THIS ONE. MY UNDERSTANDING FROM WHAT I READ IS IT'S NOT ABOUT BRINGING PUBLIC GOOD TO GET THIS PLANNED PROJECT SITE PLAN. IT'S ABOUT PROVING THAT YOU HAVE, IN FRONT OF ZBA, THAT YOU HAVE A HARDSHIP THAT REQUIRES A MODIFICATION TO THOSE VOLUMETRIC REQUIREMENTS, AND NOT A SELF-IMPOSED ONE, AND SO I HAVEN'T HAD ANY RESIDENTS -- THIS IS IN OUR WARD. I HAVEN'T HAD ANY RESIDENTS COME UP TO ME A SAY THEY DON'T WANT THIS FOR ANY SPECIFIC REASON, BUT IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT IT DOESN'T FALL TO US TO MAKE THESE KINDS OF CHANGES TO OUR ZONING, AND SO, YOU KNOW, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO THE PETITIONERS AND THE NEED FOR THIS KIND OF HOUSING IN THAT AREA, I CAN'T SUPPORT IT FOR THAT REASON.
02:50:06.927: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
02:50:12.633: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  I WANT TO THANK COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER FOR POINTING OUT THE DIFFICULTY WITH THE PLANNED PROJECT, AND I HAVE NO OPPOSITION TO THIS PROJECT. I WILL VOTE TO SUPPORT IT. BUT I REALLY WANT STAFF TO UNDERSTAND HOW RELUCTANT I AM TO USE THE VEHICLE OF PLANNED PROJECTS TO SKIRT THE REQUIREMENTS OF OUR AREA HEIGHTENED PLACEMENT REGULATIONS, AND I WILL TAKE A MUCH MORE STRINGENT VIEW OF THE USE OF PLANNED PROJECTS IN THE FUTURE. THIS PARTICULAR PARCEL IS ZONED R4, AND REALLY, THEY ARE BUILDING TO KIND OF AN R2 LEVEL OF DEVELOPMENT, SO IT'S LESS THAN WHAT COULD BE BUILT HERE. I DON'T HAVE ANY OBJECTION TO THAT. BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT USING THE PLANNED PROJECT METHOD OF SKIRTING OUR REGULATIONS IS REALLY APPROPRIATE, UNLESS THERE'S A COMPELLING -- TO THE CITY IN PURSUING THE PROJECT. SO I'LL SUPPORT THIS ONE, BECAUSE IT REALLY IS SUCH A SMALL VARIATION, BUT I AM REALLY HESITANT TO USE THIS VEHICLE IN THE FUTURE.
02:51:25.672: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
02:51:27.307: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. BEFORE MAKING ANY COMMENTS, I DO HAVE A QUESTION I WOULD LIKE TO ASK STAFF, AND I SEE MR. KHAN HERE. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TONIGHT.
02:51:38.719: >> YEAH.
02:51:38.986: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  IN THE RESPONSE TO MY QUESTION ABOUT PUBLIC FEEDBACK, IT WAS MENTIONED THAT THERE WERE CONCERNS RAISED AT THE PLANNING COMMISSION PUBLIC HEARING RELATED TO STORMWATER AND EROSION TO TRAVER CREEK, AND IF YOU COULD SPEAK TO THOSE CONCERNS? THANK YOU.
02:51:55.869: >> YEAH, I'M HAPPY TO. JEFF KHAN, PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES. I WAS THE PLANNER WHO WORKED ON THIS PROJECT. ONE OF THE CONCERNS EXPRESSED BY AT LEAST ONE MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC WAS THAT THEY FELT THAT THE SITE WAS VERY WET AND THAT IT MIGHT NOT BE APPROPRIATE FOR DEVELOPMENT. I AM NOT SURE EXACTLY WHAT BASIS THEY MADE THAT DETERMINATION. WE DON'T CONSIDER IT TO BE PARTICULARLY WET. THERE ARE A FEW SMALL WETLANDS ON THE PERIMETER OF THE SITE. THERE IS TRAVER CREEK FLOWING ON THE FAR WESTERN EDGE OF THE SITE, BUT OTHERWISE, THE SITE, FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE, IS A BUILDABLE SITE. WITH REGARD TO STORMWATER, THE PETITIONER IS PROVIDING A 100-YEAR STORM, AND IT WOULD BE OUTLETING INTO THE CREEK, AND THAT'S BEEN REVIEWED BY STAFF AND APPROVED.
02:52:51.191: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  OKAY. THANK YOU. SO I HAVE MIXED FEELINGS ON THIS ONE. ON THE ONE HAND, I DON'T BELIEVE WE SHOULD BE GRANTING, LIKE COUNCILMEMBER EATON JUST EXPRESSED, PLANNED PROJECT MODIFICATIONS WITHOUT RECEIVING A SUBSTANTIVE PUBLIC BENEFIT IN RETURN. STAFF ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE PUBLIC BENEFITS HERE ARE MINIMAL, AND TO APPROVE THE PROJECT MODIFICATIONS WITHOUT BENEFIT IS A POOR PRECEDENT, I THINK, TO SET, AND ONE I THINK THAT WE COULD REGRET LATER. HAVING SAID THAT, I DO AGREE WITH STAFF THAT THE DEVELOPERS, YOU KNOW, ASKED IN TERMS OF THE TWO MODIFICATIONS ISN'T EARTH-SHATTERING EITHER. IT'S FOR A REDUCED REAR SETBACK THAT DOESN'T IMPACT ANYONE AS THE ADJACENT PROPERTY IS THE RAILROAD RIGHT-OF-WAY, AND IT'S FOR REDUCED SEPARATION BETWEEN THE BUILDINGS THAT, ACCORDING TO STAFF, IS CONSISTENT WITH THE CHARACTER OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD. THE PROPOSAL ALSO PROVIDES 35 UNITS OF HOUSING, WHICH IS ALWAYS A POSITIVE, AND IT ALSO GENERATES A PARK -- A PARKS CONTRIBUTION AND IMPROVEMENTS TO TWO OF THE ON-SITE WETLANDS. I FRANKLY CAN SEE REASONS TO SUPPORT AND REASONS TO OPPOSE THIS PLANNED PROJECT. THANK YOU.
02:54:15.943: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
02:54:17.744: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR, AND THANK YOU TO STAFF AND THE PUBLIC WHO DID ATTEND THE PLANNING COMMISSION, A SMALL HANDFUL OF FOLKS DID, AND SHARED THEIR CONCERNS, WHICH THE PLANNING COMMISSION WAS ABLE TO DISCUSS. AND THANKS TO THE PETITIONER FOR ACTUALLY BEING FAIRLY RESPONSIVE IN THOSE REQUESTS, ONE OF WHICH WAS TO PUT UP FENCING AROUND AN OPEN PIT ON THE SITE, WHICH THEY COMPLIED WITH WITHIN 24 HOURS, WHICH WAS REALLY A GOOD SIGN OF GOOD FAITH. NOT EVERYONE DOES THAT, UNFORTUNATELY. THE -- I'LL JUST SAY TO THE SUBJECT OF THE PLANNED PROJECT, WE LAY OUT THESE EIGHT REQUIREMENTS, AND YOU ONLY HAVE TO ACCOMPLISH ONE OR MORE OF THEM. THE ONE THAT THIS DEVELOPER IS CHOOSING TO COMPLY WITH IS THE BUILDING OR PARKING SETBACKS IS IN EXCESS OF THE MINIMUM REQUIRED BY THE ZONING DISTRICT, AND I THINK, FRANKLY, THAT THAT IS, YOU KNOW, A LIGHT ASK, AND -- BUT IT'S AN ASK THAT WE ARE MAKING, AND IT'S ONE THAT THEY ARE DELIVERING ON, AND THAT'S AN ISSUE WITH OUR CODE MORE THAN IT IS THIS PROJECT, AND I'M PERFECTLY OPEN AND INTERESTED IN REVISITING OUR PLANNED PROJECT, ESPECIALLY AS WE LOOK TO IMPROVE OUR KIND OF CARBON STANDPOINT ON PRIVATE PROPERTY. THE I'LL JUST SAY THAT I THINK THIS IS NEEDED HOUSING IN ANN ARBOR. AS WE TALK ABOUT THIS MISSING MIDDLE OF HOUSING, IT'S FOR FOLKS WHO HAVE AN INCOME, COULD POTENTIALLY BUY INTO A COMMUNITY LIKE ANN ARBOR, BUT THE HOUSING PRICES ARE JUST OUT OF REACH, AND INEXPENSIVELY CONSTRUCTED DUPLEXES ARE AN ANSWER TO THAT. THEY MAY NOT BE CHEAP IMMEDIATELY, BUT WHEN NEW CONSTRUCTION, YOU KNOW, IS AT ABOUT THE SAME AVERAGE PRICE AS A HOME IN ANN ARBOR, THAT'S A GOOD SIGN THAT THEY WILL BE APPROACHABLE TO FOLKS IN COMING YEARS. AND I THINK THAT THAT'S THE KIND OF HOUSING WE NEED TO BE ENCOURAGING. SO I'M GLAD. I THINK THIS IS MODEST. I THINK IT'S RESPONSIBLY PLACED ON THE SITE, AND I'M GLAD THAT THE DEVELOPER HAS PROVEN TO BE RESPONSIVE THROUGH THE PROCESS.
02:56:34.715: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
02:56:36.450: >> COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER: YES. WELL, I TOO WANT TO ECHO SOME OF WHAT'S ALREADY BEEN SAID BY HAYNER, EATON, LUMM AND ACKERMAN. A LOT OF RESIDENTS HAVE BEEN EXPRESSING CONCERN THAT WE ARE USING THESE PLANNED PROJECT MODIFICATIONS ON A CASE-BY-CASE SUBJECTIVE BASIS, AND IT REALLY SHOULD BE ACCORDING TO THE MICHIGAN ZONING ENABLING ACT, IT SHOULD BE GOING THROUGH OUR ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS, AND THAT THAT'S THE APPROPRIATE BODY TO BE MAKING THESE DECISIONS. AND THIS -- IT'S A BAD SITUATION BROUGHT TO US, REALLY, IN THAT THIS IS A GOOD PROJECT, AS ACKERMAN SAID. IT'S THE MISSING MIDDLE AND STUFF, BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE ARE VULNERABLE IF WE HAVE A PROJECT THAT WE DON'T LIKE AND THAT IS REQUESTING A P.P.M. AND THEN WE COULD BE EXPOSING OURSELVES TO A LAWSUIT IF WE DECLINE A FUTURE PROJECT AFTER WE HAVE BEEN DOING PPMs BEFORE, SO FOR THAT REASON, I WOULD LIKE TO ECHO COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER'S SUGGESTION THAT THIS GO BACK THROUGH THE APPROPRIATE BODY, WHICH WOULD BE THE ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS.
02:57:57.898: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
02:58:05.305: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER: THANKS. I WANT TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THIS IDEA THAT THIS IS A LITTLE BIT OUT OF PLACE HERE FOR US. THE IDEA OF SENDING SOMETHING BACK THROUGH THE PROCESS THAT THE LAW STIPULATES IS NOT A WAY TO KILL A PROJECT OR HURT A PROJECT OR ANYTHING, AND THERE HAS BEEN SOME -- I MEAN, I WAS JUST LOOKING AT SOME STUFF ABOUT BOSTON'S ZBA IN THE NEWS, AND SO THEY HAD 2,600, 2,700 PROJECTS GO TO BOSTON ZBA. IN AN OLD CITY BEING REDEVELOPED LIKE THAT, EVERYBODY WANTS A VARIANCE, AND OF THOSE 2700, ONLY 100 WERE NOT APPROVED BY THE ZBA IN BOSTON, AND SO IT'S NOT SOME KIND OF PUNISHMENT. IT'S JUST ASKING THAT DEVELOPMENT FITS THE REQUIREMENTS THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE FOR IT. THAT'S ALL. IS THAT NOT THE PROCESS THAT'S SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN HERE? WHY HAVE WE GIVEN OUR -- AND WHAT IS THE MECHANISM THAT GIVES US THIS AUTHORITY AND THESE EIGHT REASONS THAT WE ARE COMPELLED TO APPROVE SOMETHING THAT IS OUTSIDE OF OUR DIMENSIONAL REQUIREMENTS? I SIMPLY DON'T KNOW. MAYBE MR. POSTEMA COULD ANSWER THAT.
02:59:19.446: >> STATE LAW.
02:59:20.547: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  SO IT'S COMPLETELY AT OUR DISCRETION TO APPROVE OR REJECT A PLANNED PROJECT MODIFICATION?
02:59:26.586: >> WE HAVE ADVISED YOU OF THESE THINGS BEFORE. IT IS NOT A COMPLETE DISCRETION. THERE ARE CRITERION IN THERE, BUT YOU HAVE DISCRETION ON HOW TO APPLY IT.
02:59:35.228: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  YEAH, IT'S JUST -- I -- IT SEEMS A LITTLE ODD TO ME, AND I WOULD LIKE TO RECOMMEND THAT, AS WE DISCUSS OUR BUDGET AND THE BUDGET ESPECIALLY FOR COUNCIL IN THE FUTURE, THAT PERHAPS WE COULD GET THE KIND OF BEING BROUGHT UP TO SPEED THAT PREVIOUS COUNCILS HAD BEEN. IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT WE WERE GIVEN A HALF DAY OR A ONE-DAY CLASS ON WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT AND HOW PLANNING WAS SUPPOSED TO GO DOWN, AND I TALKED TO WENDY A COUPLE OF YEARS BACK, AND SHE SAID, OH, YEAH, HERE'S A STACK OF BOOKS THAT EVERYBODY ON COUNCIL IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN GIVEN AND READ, AND SHE HANDED ME A COPY OF THEM ALL. THIS WAS SEVERAL YEARS AGO, AND I THOUGHT, OKAY, THANKS, AND I WENT THROUGH THEM, AND A COUPLE WERE DATED, BUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S A LOT TO PUT TOGETHER WITHOUT INSTRUCTIONS, SO MAYBE WE COULD INCLUDE SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN THE BUDGET, TO GET PEOPLE UP TO SPEED SO THAT WE KNOW WHAT WE ARE DOING HERE. I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE THAT. THANK YOU.
03:00:29.749: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? FOR MY PART, I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS, AND I GUESS I WOULD JUST AFFIRM THAT I BELIEVE THAT OUR PLANNED PROJECT PROCESSES ARE CONSISTENT WITH STATE LAW, AUTHORIZED BY STATE LAW, AND ARE WISE. YOU KNOW, I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE AS A COUNCIL HAVE THE ABILITY TO BE FLEXIBLE. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE AS A COUNCIL HAVE THE ABILITY TO, WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF LAW, AS THE PLANNED PROJECT PROCESS IS, TO, YOU KNOW, REVIEW AND APPROVE PROJECTS THAT FOR REASONS OF GEOMETRY AND FOR OTHER REASONS REQUIRE SOME FLEXIBILITY AND HAVE SOME CONCOMITANT BENEFIT. TO MY VIEW, THIS MEETS THOSE CRITERIA, AND I'M DELIGHTED TO MOVE IT FORWARD AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
03:01:21.901: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  THANK YOU. I THINK THE PETITIONER WANTED TO ADDRESS COUNCIL. IF IT'S OKAY WITH THE BODY, WE COULD PERHAPS HAVE THE PETITIONER ADDRESS US WITH SOME THOUGHTS.
03:01:36.716: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  PLEASE.
03:01:39.753: >> THANK YOU, COUNCIL, VERY MUCH. MY NAME IS MICHAEL POWELL. I AM THE DESIGN ENGINEER FOR THE PROJECT. I'M ALSO A TRUSTEE IN WHITE LAKE TOWNSHIP, WHICH IS MUCH SMALLER THAN ANN ARBOR. I GRADUATED FROM THE U OF M, AND TO ADDRESS YOUR CONCERN, CERTAINLY IN THE PAST, THE ENABLING LEGISLATION DID NOT RECOGNIZE PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS. HOWEVER, IT IS A LEGITIMATELY APPROVED AND AUTHORIZED BY THE STATE OF MICHIGAN TO ELIMINATE THE NEED TO GO TO THE ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS FOR EVERY DIFFERENT LITTLE CHANGE THAT THE DEVELOPER MIGHT AGREE WITH THE COMMUNITY. SO, IN THE COMMUNITY I REPRESENT, WE HAVE A PLANNED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE AS WELL, IN WHICH THE EXECUTIVE BODY, THE LEGISLATIVE BODY CAN IN FACT SEE A BIGGER PICTURE THAN MEASURING THE DISTANCE BETWEEN BUILDINGS OR THE VARIOUS OTHER THINGS THAT GO ON, BECAUSE THERE'S A GREAT DEAL OF ADDITIONAL DETAIL THAT GOES INTO THESE BIG PROJECTS OR THESE PROJECTS NOW, THAT IT WOULD INUNDATE THE ZBA. AND I'M ON THE ZBA AS WELL, AND I JUST LEFT A THREE-HOUR MEETING YESTERDAY FOR THAT, AND IF WE HAD TO ADDRESS ALL OF THOSE ITEMS, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EVEN LONGER. AND SO THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT PLANNING ITEM THAT THE STATE, QUITE FRANKLY, AUTHORIZED FOR COMMUNITIES TO BE ABLE TO ADOPT, AND THIS PARTICULAR ONE. I ALSO WANT TO LET THE COUNCIL KNOW THAT THIS PROJECT WAS APPROVED IN 2013. IT CONSISTED OF 19 -- WHEN I SAY VERY LARGE SINGLE-FAMILY HOME SITES THAT, QUITE FRANKLY, THE OWNER HAS HAD A CHANGE OF HEART. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE AND HIGH COST TO SELL THESE 19 SINGLE-FAMILY HOME SITES. HE HAS GONE THROUGH THE PROCESS. HE HAS MET ALL OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE ANN ARBOR TOWNSHIP -- ANN ARBOR CITY ZONING ORDINANCE, AND HE HAS NOW GREATLY REDUCED THE COST OF THESE AND MADE THEM A MUCH MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THAT AREA OF THE CITY. SO, AGAIN, I AM HERE TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS, BUT FROM A PLANNING PERSPECTIVE, THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT PLANNING THAT, QUITE FRANKLY, THE CITY COUNCIL ADOPTED AS PART OF THE ZONING ORDINANCE HERE IN THE CITY.
03:04:02.395: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
03:04:04.264: >> SO THANK YOU.
03:04:05.865: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  I HAVE A QUESTION. HE SAID HE HAD A TECHNICAL QUESTION. SO THE TWO SMALL WETLANDS THAT ARE SET UP ON THAT SITE, NOT FOR IMPROVEMENTS THEY CALLED IT, BUT I READ WHAT THE IMPROVEMENTS ARE. SO THOSE ARE WELL UNDERNEATH THE SQUARE ACREAGE NECESSARY TO GET ANY MDQ INPUT ON THAT, BY ITS PROXIMITY TO TRAVER CREEK?
03:04:27.020: >> YES, CERTAINLY THEY WERE, AND WE WORKED WITH STAFF. THEY WERE ALONG THE EASTERLY SIDE OF THE DEVELOPMENT, AND IT WAS AN EXISTING WETLANDS THAT THE APPLICANT ACTUALLY ENHANCED, AND THEN BEFORE, AS THE WATER CAME OFF OF THE RAILROAD TRESTLE, THERE WAS ANOTHER WETLAND IN THERE WHICH WAS IN DANGER OF BECOMING NONEXISTENT, AND THAT WAS REBUILT AS WELL. SO WE ENHANCED EXISTING WETLANDS AS WELL AS ESTABLISHED A COUPLE OF NEW WETLANDS ON SITE.
03:04:56.182: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  YEAH, I THINK THAT THE CONCERNS -- I KNOW SOME OF THE CONCERNS, YOU MAY RECALL THAT FURTHER UP, OR FURTHER -- DEPENDING ON WHAT DIRECTION YOU'RE GOING, I GUESS, FURTHER SOUTH ON THE TRACKS THERE, WE HAD THE BIG WASHOUT, RIGHT? AND THERE WERE CONCERNS THERE BECAUSE THAT WAS A FLOW OVER OF TRAVER CREEK AT THAT TIME TOO.
03:05:11.564: >> YES, WE HAD THAT SAME PROBLEM HERE, AND THEY WERE TOTALLY REBUILT AND REESTABLISHED, MEETING THIS --
03:05:20.473: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  SO THERE IS NO VERGING WETLAND ACTION LIKE UP BY NIXON FARMS.
03:05:28.381: >> NO.
03:05:28.615: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  I THOUGHT THIS WAS A SECOND WAVE OF THAT.
03:05:30.483: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU. FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER NELSON. NELSON?
03:05:36.456: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  YES. SMITH?
03:05:37.724: >> COUNCILMEMBER SMITH:  YES.

03:05:40.026: >> CLERK BEAUDRY:  COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
03:05:42.395: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  NO.
03:05:42.996: >> CLERK BEAUDRY:  COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER?

03:05:55.208: >> CLERK BEAUDRY:  THE MOTION CARRIES.
03:05:59.746: >> MAYOR TAYLOR: RESOLUTION TO APPROVE FY 2020 FEE ADJUSTMENTS FOR THE ASSESSOR'S OFFICE, FINANCIAL SERVICES AREA MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER SMITH, SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI. DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [ CHORUS OF AYES ] OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. GS2, DO WE HAVE A RECONSIDERATION OF -- THANK YOU -- CONSIDERATION OF -- ONE MOMENT. MY APOLOGIES. DS2, MOTION TO RECONSIDER 2019 VOTE -- PLAN AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT AT 616 EAST WASHINGTON STREET, MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI. MR. POSTEMA?
03:07:02.141: >> I JUST WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT MR. McDONALD HAS SENT OUT AN ADVICE MEMO ON THIS ISSUE TO COUNCIL. I WOULD RECOMMEND THEY TAKE A MINUTE. WE ARE HAPPY TO GO INTO CLOSED SESSION, BUT WE HAVE ADDRESSED THIS ISSUE SEVERAL TIMES IN THE PAST.
03:07:14.987: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  HAS EVERYONE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO READ MR. McDONALD'S VIEWS ON THIS MATTER? DOES ANYONE FEEL A NEED TO GO INTO CLOSED SESSION ON THIS MATTER? DISCUSSION OF THE MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER NELSON. COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER?
03:07:33.573: >> COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER: WELL, AM I GOING TO GET TO EXPLAIN WHY I BROUGHT IT BACK?
03:07:36.976: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  IF YOU WISH TO SAY SOMETHING, YOU MAY, OF COURSE.
03:07:41.280: >> COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER: OKAY, I WOULD.
03:07:42.281: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  WELL, YOU HAVEN'T BROUGHT IT BACK. THIS IS THE MOTION TO RECONSIDER BRINGING IT BACK. BUT, YES, OF COURSE.
03:07:48.654: >> COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER: OKAY. WELL, THE REASON I WAS BRINGING -- ASKING TO BRING THIS BACK, I HAD VOTED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE ON THIS BACK DECEMBER 2ND, BUT SINCE THAT TIME, MANY OF US HAVE RECEIVED PHONE CALLS, VISITS AT CAUCUS, LOTS OF EMAILS FROM ESTEEMED RESIDENTS IN THE COMMUNITY INDICATING THAT WE HAD MADE A MISTAKE ON TWO MAIN ISSUES. ONE, USING THE PLANNED PROJECT MODIFICATION IN THIS CASE IS SUBJECTIVE AND ARBITRARY, AND THE RISK IS THAT WE ARE SETTING A PRECEDENT THAT COULD EXPOSE US TO A LAWSUIT IN THE FUTURE IF WE DECLINED A PPM. AND THEN THE OTHER REASON THAT PEOPLE HAVE ASKED US TO COME BACK WITH IT AND RECONSIDER IT WAS IS THE ISSUE OF THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING, AND THIS PROJECT STARTED BEFORE WE CHANGED OUR NEW PREMIUM RULES, BUT WHEN WE ARE DOING A PPM, WE NEED TO GET A STRONG COMMUNITY BENEFIT, AND WE, ON DECEMBER 2ND, APPROVED 19 AFFORDABLE UNITS, WHEN ACCORDING TO OUR NEW MORE ROBUST AFFORDABLE HOUSING PREMIUMS, WE WOULD BE ENTITLED TO MORE THAN 70 AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS, AND GIVEN THE MAGNITUDE OF THIS BUILDING, ITS SIZE, 208 FEET, CHANGE TO THE CHURCHES IN THE AREA AND THE SKYLINE AND THE VIEWS AND THE STREETSCAPE, SO IT'S A MAJOR BUILDING, AND SO AT A MINIMUM, THE IDEA WAS THAT WE SHOULD AT LEAST GET THE OVER 70 AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS THAT WE HAVE AGREED TO IN OUR NEW PREMIUM RULES, AND SO THAT WAS WHY I WAS BRINGING IT BACK, GIVEN RESIDENT PRESSURE THAT WE SHOULD THINK MORE CLOSELY ABOUT THE PPM ON THIS WITH AN INTENT OF AVOIDING LAWSUITS, AND THEN ALSO WHETHER WE ARE WILLING TO, IN A SENSE, DO THE DEVELOPERS A FAVOR BY ALLOWING THEM THE 19 AFFORDABLE UNITS, RATHER THAN COME ON STRONG ON THE SIDE OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT, WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN -- WHICH SHOULD BE OVER 70 UNITS. SO THOSE WERE THE TWO REASONS WHY I WAS ASKING YOU TO RECONSIDER THIS MASSIVE CHANGE TO OUR DOWNTOWN WASHINGTON STREET, LIBERTY, STATE AREA. THANK YOU.
03:10:55.575: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MOTION TO RECONSIDER? COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
03:11:00.646: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  I GENERALLY LIKE TO SUPPORT RECONSIDERATION TO HAVE FULL-THROATED DISCUSSION, SO I MAY OR MAY NOT SUPPORT THE RECONSIDERATION. I WON'T ULTIMATELY SUPPORT REVISITING THIS, AND I -- YES, WE HAVE, AS YOU HAVE NOTED, COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER HEARD FROM A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO OBJECT TO WHAT I SUPPORTEDD OTHERS, AND I WILL JUST SAY WITH REGARD TO THIS, IT IS UNUSUAL TO RECONSIDER A SITE PLAN, AND WE HAVE APPROVED THE DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT, SO WE HAVE APPROVED A CONTRACT, AND -- [ OFF MIC ] -- RIGHT, BUT I -- AS WAS JUST NOTED, IT IS NOT A SIGNED CONTRACT, BUT IT WOULD BE EXTRAORDINARY TO GO BACK ON AN AGREEMENT LIKE THAT, AND SO I'M NOT COMFORTABLE DOING THAT. I DO UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE SAYING UNDER THE NEW RULES, WE'D GET MORE AFFORDABLE UNITS, IF THAT WERE ECONOMICALLY -- IF THE PROJECT -- IF THE PROJECT WOULD BE ECONOMICALLY VIABLE TO GENERATE THE NUMBER OF UNITS THAT THE NEW REGS WOULD ESSENTIALLY REQUIRE. THIS PROJECT WAS IN THE PIPELINE BEFORE WE APPROVED THOSE REGS, AND I DON'T THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO, YOU KNOW, CHANGE THE RULES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GAME, YOU KNOW, TO TAKE THAT APPROACH, WHICH WE'D BE APPLYING NEW RULES THAT WEREN'T IN EFFECT WHEN THIS PROJECT WAS BEING REVIEWED. SO, THAT'S ALSO A CONCERN THAT I HAVE. SO, THANKS.
03:12:56.362: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN?
03:12:58.230: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I ACTUALLY WON'T BE SUPPORTING RECONSIDERATION. I THINK WE GOT PRETTY WELL-REASONED LEGAL ADVICE FROM MR. POSTEMA'S OFFICE. I THINK THERE ARE TIMES WHEN WE CAN TAKE THAT ADVICE AND PUSH BOUNDARIES. I THINK THIS WAS WELL-REASONED, AND I'LL END UP TAKING THAT VALUABLE ADVICE. I THINK, TOO, I SPOKE AT LENGTH AT OUR LAST MEETING AT THE BEGINNING OF THE MONTH ABOUT WHY I SUPPORTED BOTH THE 616 WASHINGTON AND 212 STATE STREET DEVELOPMENTS, AND PEOPLE ARE WELCOME TO REFERENCE THAT. WE'LL SEE HOW THIS VOTE GOES. I WON'T BORE YOU ALL NOW.
03:13:49.315: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
03:13:51.117: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  THANK YOU, MAYOR TAYLOR. SORRY I SOUND SO HOARSE. LIKE MY COLLEAGUES HAVE STATED, I'M USUALLY IN SUPPORT OF OFFERING, YOU KNOW, RECONSIDERATION, BUT IN THIS CASE, BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT WE HAVE HAD LEGAL ADVICE STATING IT'S GOING TO CAUSE SOME SIGNIFICANT ISSUES, ON TOP OF THE FACT THAT THERE IS NOTHING REALLY NEW THAT HAS COME TO LIGHT SINCE WE HAVE TAKEN THE VOTE, THERE WAS PLENTY OF PUBLIC INPUT AND DUE PROCESS LEADING UP TO THE VOTE. I VOTED AGAINST IT, AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT, IN MY OPINION, THAT IT WAS APPROVED, BUT, UNFORTUNATELY, I DON'T SEE THE GROUNDS TO BRING IT BACK FOR RECONSIDERATION. I JUST -- THERE IS NOTHING -- NOTHING NEW HAS COME TO LIGHT TO SUGGEST THAT IT SHOULD BE BROUGHT BACK.
03:14:51.443: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  PERHAPS WE CAN MOVE ON? FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, ON THE MOTION TO RECONSIDER. COUNCILMEMBER NELSON. NELSON?
03:15:01.487: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  NO. SMITH?
03:15:03.088: >> COUNCILMEMBER SMITH:  NO. RAMLAWI?

03:15:18.237: >> CLERK BEAUDRY:  COUNCILMEMBER EATON?
03:15:19.071: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  YES.
03:15:20.906: >> CLERK BEAUDRY:  THE MOTION FAILS.
03:15:22.007: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  WE HAVE BEFORE US THE CLERK'S REPORT OF PETITIONS, COMMUNICATIONS AND REFERRAL. MAY I HAVE A MOTION PLEASE? DISCUSSION OF THE CLERK'S REPORT? ALL IN FAVOR? OPPOSED? THE CLERK'S REPORT IS APPROVED. WE NOW COME TO PUBLIC COMMENT GENERAL TIME, AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO SPEAK TO COUNCIL AND COMMUNITY ABOUT MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST. SPEAKERS NEED NOT HAVE SIGNED UP IN ADVANCE. SPEAKERS HAVE THREE MINUTES TO SPEAK, SO PLEASE PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE TIME CLOCK. WE MAY HAVE ONLY ONE PERSON SPEAKING AT A TIME. IF YOU REQUIRE ASSISTANCE IN SPEAKING TO COUNCIL TODAY, WE'D BE DELIGHTED TO PROVIDE IT TO YOU.
03:16:09.221: >> WE ARE GOING INTO THE NEW YEAR, AND WE ARE GOING INTO AN ELECTION YEAR, AND I HOPE THAT THINGS WON'T GET PERSONAL AND NASTY LIKE LAST TIME, AND MY HOPES MAY BE DASHED, BUT I HOPE THAT THE DISCUSSIONS WILL BE ABOUT POLICY. I WANT TO COME UP HERE AND WISH YOU, REGARDLESS OF YOUR FAITH OR CULTURE AND WHAT HAVE YOU, THAT YOU HAVE A VERY HAPPY NEW YEAR AND HOLIDAY. OTHERWISE, HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.
03:16:40.953: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU.
03:16:46.125: >> I WAS ONE OF THE IMPETUS FOR MS. BANNISTER'S MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION, AND I GUESS I JUST HAVE TO SAY THIS. I UNDERSTAND THE LEGAL END OF IT. I HA READ THE LOWER TOWN COMPLAINT. I'M NOT A MAVEN OF THAT AREA. I HAVE PRACTICED LAW FOR 25 YEARS, AND I THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT REALLY CAREFULLY, BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT THE LOWER TOWN LAWSUIT HAS MERIT, AND THAT'S THE EXACT ISSUE THAT YOU HAVE HERE ON THIS PROJECT AND ON HIDEAWAY AND ON WHO KNOWS HOW MANY OTHER ONES WILL COME DOWN THE PIKE, AND I THINK THAT TO ESSENTIALLY USURP THE ROLE OF THE ZBA, THAT'S A HEAVY RESPONSIBILITY. THERE'S CERTAINLY COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE -- THAT THE CITY COUNCIL FUNCTIONS IN THAT SAME CAPACITY, BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT WE HAVE, AND THAT'S -- I THINK IT REALLY NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT CAREFULLY. I'M A MEMBER OF THE CHURCH ACROSS THE STREET THERE, AND THAT'S GOING TO BE DARK FOREVER, AND IT'S HIGHER THAN -- IT'S 28 FEET HIGHER THAN WHAT'S ALLOWED. THAT'S WAY -- THAT'S A BIG VARIANCE, AND I RATIONALIZED IT BY SAYING, OKAY, IT CAN BE LEVERAGED FOR THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WE HAVE A CRISIS. EVERYONE ON THIS PANEL HAS SAID THERE IS AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS. HERE'S A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY TO GET A LOT OF AFFORDABLE UNITS. IT'S UNFAIR TO THE DEVELOPER? I'M JUST NOT BUYING THAT. THANK YOU.
03:18:22.554: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT?
03:18:30.996: >> HI. MY NAME IS R. JEFFREY BENCO. I LIVE AT 213 WEST MADISON STREET, JUST RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO THE WASHTENAW DAIRY. I SENT AN EMAIL OUT TO THE GENERAL CITY COUNCIL EMAIL ADDRESS AND TO PLANNING TODAY. I JUST WANTED TO GIVE A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND ON THAT. THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS, I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE ORDINANCES, ET CETERA, THAT ARE GOING TO BE IMPACTING THE -- GOING FROM A MEDICAL PERMIT TO A RECREATIONAL PERMIT FOR SPECIFICALLY THE -- OR IN GENERAL AND MORE SPECIFICALLY FOR 702 SOUTH MAIN STREET, WHERE THERE HAS BEEN AT LEAST SOME APPROVAL ON THE SPECIAL USE EXCEPTION ON THAT. I GUESS I WAS BASICALLY, FROM MY UNDERSTANDING SO FAR, IT SEEMED LIKE THERE WAS ONLY A PROCESS OF IF SOMEBODY HAD A MEDICAL SPECIAL USE THAT IT WOULD AUTOMATICALLY BE ABLE TO GET A RECREATIONAL ONE, AND I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. SO I WASN'T SURE EXACTLY HOW TO MOVE THAT CONCERN FORWARD, SO I PREPARED THAT EMAIL AND SENT IT OUT. SO I JUST HOPE -- AND THAT I REALIZE THERE WASN'T GOING TO BE AN IMMEDIATE RESPONSE ON THAT, BUT I WOULD JUST LIKE THE ABILITY THERE TO SAY I HOPE TO CLARIFY MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE DETAILS WITH THAT. IF IT IS THAT ELEMENT THAT IT WAS JUST A SIMPLE MEANS TO MOVE FROM A MEDICAL TO RECREATIONAL, THEN I REALLY EXPRESS JUST MY INDIVIDUAL BELIEF THAT THAT REALLY WASN'T SUFFICIENT. I DO FEEL LIKE THOSE ARE TWO SEPARATE FACILITIES, AND THEY REQUIRE SOME ADDITIONAL PROCESS IN BETWEEN THAT, OR AT LEAST THE ABILITY FOR THE PUBLIC TO COMMENT. AND THEN JUST FINALLY TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND HOW THAT DISCUSSION CAN CONTINUE WITH THE RIGHT CONTEXT ON THAT. SO, THANK YOU.
03:20:29.848: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU.
03:20:39.958: >> GOOD EVENING, COUNCIL. JUST A MOMENT. (BELL RINGING.) 24,614, 20,495, 83,494. DO ANY OF YOU KNOW WHAT THESE NUMBERS ARE? NO? WELL, YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU HAD SHOWED UP TO THE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT SESSIONS ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING. CITY STAFF WAS THERE WITH LOTS OF GRAPHICS. I WENT TO FOUR OF THESE MEETINGS. I SPOKE AT LENGTH WITH A VARIETY OF CITY STAFF. 24,614 PEOPLE LIVE AND WORK IN ANN ARBOR. 20,495 LIVE HERE BUT WORK ELSEWHERE. 83,494 LIVE ELSEWHERE BUT WORK HERE AND COMMUTE HERE. NOW, THAT JUST SAYS IT ALL TO ME, BUT I HAVE MORE THINGS I NEED TO GET TO. I MET A 78-YEAR-OLD MAN WHO LIVES BEYOND BELLEVILLE. HE DRIVES TO YPSI TO TAKE THE BUS HERE TO WORK AT A BAR FOR JANITORIAL SERVICES. HE'S LOOKING FOR A NEW JOB, BECAUSE THEY ARE DOING CONSTRUCTION. THE Y LOT IN PARTICULAR I LEARNED THAT THE UPPER FLOORS OF THE OLD Y WERE FOR LOW-INCOME INDIVIDUALS, AND I ENCOURAGE YOU ALL TO TAKE A LOOK AT BREAKINGGROUND.ORG, AND THAT'S A FANTASTIC ORGANIZATION FROM NEW YORK CITY THAT A WOMAN FROM THE DELANA CENTER I MET WORKED WITH, AND YOU CAN SEE THE TYPES OF BEAUTIFUL BUILDINGS THAT ADD CHARACTER TO THE CITY AND ALSO GIVE THE MOST VULNERABLE IN THE COMMUNITY A CHANCE AT A PLACE TO LIVE. WHAT ELSE DO I HAVE? OH, ANOTHER THING I HAVE LEARNED AT THE DELANA CENTER IS A LOT OF INDIVIDUALS THAT USE THOSE SERVICES HAVE A FEAR OF THE POLICE, SO THEY FEEL LIKE THEY ARE TARGETED. LET'S SEE. I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY ONE THING IS YOU REALLY CAN'T STOP CHANGE. ANN ARBOR CHANGES. EVERYWHERE CHANGES. YOU CAN ONLY IGNORE IT, YOU KNOW, BURY YOUR HEAD IN THE SAND, WHATEVER. AND I'M A RESIDENT HERE EXPRESSING MY CONCERN FOR THE GROSS LACK OF HOUSING IN THE CITY. BUILD MORE DUPLEXES, PLEASE, TINY HOMES, EFFICIENCIES, ANYWHERE I COULD LIVE OR ANYWHERE PEOPLE AT THE DELANA CENTER COULD LIVE. THANK YOU. (BELL RINGING.)
03:23:56.488: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT? SEEING NO ONE, PUBLIC COMMENT IS CLOSED. ARE THERE COMMUNICATIONS TODAY FROM COUNCIL? DO WE HAVE A CLOSED SESSION TODAY?
03:24:09.501: >> WE DO, MAYOR. WE HAVE A CLOSED SESSION ON A WRITTEN ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGED COMMUNICATION UNDER THE OPEN MEETINGS ACT, AND INCORPORATED THROUGH THE STATE STATUTE, THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT. WE ALSO HAVE A CLOSED SESSION ON LAND PURCHASES BY THE CITY. YOU.
03:24:29.354: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  MAY I HAVE A MOTION PLEASE TO GO INTO CLOSED SESSION ON THAT BASIS? MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN. DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
03:24:36.528: >> COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER:  I'M SORRY. DID WE SAY WE ARE GOING TO GO TALK ABOUT ANNEXATIONS?
03:24:40.532: >> YOU HAVE RECEIVED COMMUNICATIONS ON THAT, WRITTEN ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGED COMMUNICATION, YES.
03:24:49.508: >> COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER: OKAY. I WOULD LIKE TO SUGGEST THAT I AM -- I AM A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE IN THE SPIRIT OF TRANSPARENCY AND OPENNESS. I FEEL THAT COUNCIL SHOULD DISCUSS OUR POLICY ABOUT WHETHER WE WILL BE DOING THESE ANNEXATIONS AND OUR POLICY ABOUT HOW WE USE OUR ATTORNEY'S OFFICE RESOURCES. BOTH OF THOSE ISSUES ARE PUBLIC POLICY DECISIONS, IN MY MIND, AND SHOULD BE DISCUSSED HERE AT THE TABLE WHERE RESIDENTS HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR HOW WE ARE USING OUR ATTORNEY'S OFFICE'S RESOURCES AND WHAT OUR POLICY IS ABOUT ANNEXATIONS. TO ME, I'M SORT OF UNCOMFORTABLE THAT WE PUT THE BLANKET CLOSED SESSION PARAGRAPH ON OUR AGENDAS, AND MCLA SECTION H IS WHAT WE ARE UNDER, AND TO ME I HAD -- MY QUESTION WAS, YOU KNOW, DO WE HAVE LIMITED ATTORNEY'S OFFICE RESOURCES?
03:25:55.006: >> COUNCILMEMBER, THAT'S NOT THE DISCUSSION. THE DISCUSSION IS ADVICE IN CLOSED SESSIO WE CAN ADVISE YOU CERTAINLY ON THAT, BUT YOU HAVE GOTTEN WRITTEN ADVICE, AND I THINK IT'S BEST FOR YOU TO HEAR THAT FIRST.
03:26:08.153: >> COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER: WELL, IF THERE'S NO PENDING LITIGATION ABOUT ANNEXATIONS, AND IF THERE'S NO FINANCIAL STAKE IN THE PENDING -- IN THE ANNEXATIONS, I REALLY WOULD PREFER, AND I'M GOING TO VOTE AGAINST -- I WOULD LIKE TO REMIND COUNCIL THAT GOING INTO CLOSED SESSION IS I BELIEVE AN EIGHT VOTE REQUIREMENT, AND I PERSONALLY WOULD MUCH PREFER THAT THE RESIDENTS IMPACTED HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR OUR THOUGHTS ABOUT USE OF ATTORNEY'S OFFICE RESOURCES AND THE WHOLE POLICY SURROUNDING ANNEXATIONS. THANK YOU.
03:26:44.990: >> THAT'S A SEPARATE ISSUE. THAT CERTAINLY COULD BE DONE IN OPEN SESSION.
03:26:51.229: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER NELSON. NELSON?
03:26:57.135: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON:  YES. SMITH?
03:26:59.204: >> COUNCILMEMBER SMITH: RAMLAWI?
03:27:00.438: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI:  YES.
03:27:01.072: >> CLERK BEAUDRY:  COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
03:27:02.874: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER:  NO.
03:27:03.475: >> CLERK BEAUDRY:  COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER?
03:27:04.376: >> COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER:  NO.
03:27:06.411: >> CLERK BEAUDRY:  COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD?
03:27:07.312: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD:  YES.
03:27:07.946: >> CLERK BEAUDRY:  COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
03:27:08.780: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  YES. GRAND?
03:27:09.848: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRAND:  YES.
03:27:10.515: >> CLERK BEAUDRY:  COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN?
03:27:11.416: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN:  YES.
03:27:12.183: >> CLERK BEAUDRY:  MAYOR TAYLOR?
03:27:12.817: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  YES.
03:27:14.219: >> CLERK BEAUDRY:  COUNCILMEMBER EATON?
03:27:15.053: >> COUNCILMEMBER EATON:  YES.
03:27:15.687: >> CLERK BEAUDRY:  THE MOTION CARRIES. [ GAVEL ]
03:27:17.522: >> AND JUST TO MAKE CLEAR, THIS IS NOT UNDER LITIGATION. THIS IS UNDER MATERIALS EXEMPT UNDER THE OPEN MEETINGS ACT. THANK YOU.
03:27:26.898: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  THANK YOU. (COUNCIL MEETING IN CLOSED SESSION.)
