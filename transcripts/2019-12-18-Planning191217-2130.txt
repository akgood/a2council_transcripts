00:00:45.722: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  A LOT OF ALPHABETICAL ORDER TO GET US ALL THINKING.
00:00:50.393: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  SOMETIME, I WILL SHARE THE BORING REASON WHY IT'S IN THAT ORDER.
00:01:00.136: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  DO WE HAVE ANY INTRODUCTIONS THIS EVENING?
00:01:06.376: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  FROM THE CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE, CHRIS HAS BEEN INVALUABLE IN HELPING PRESENT TO YOU A BETTER DRAFT OF THE SIGN ORDINANCE, AND HE IS HERE TO MAKE SURE THAT I DON'T GET YOU INTO ANY TROUBLE.
00:01:20.523: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  THANK YOU AND WELCOME. APPROVAL OF THE AGENDA, DO WE HAVE A COMMISSIONER THAT WILL MOVE THE AGENDA? MOVED BY COMMISSIONER MILLS, SECOND BY COMMISSIONER SAUVE. COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT?
00:01:31.801: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT: I NEED TO MAKE A MOTION TO AMEND THE AGENDA TO REMOVE 825 NORTH MAPLE.
00:01:40.243: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  THANK YOU. THAT APPLICANT HAS WITHDRAWN THE PETITION, SO I WOULD SUGGEST WE AMEND THE AGENDA TO REMOVE THAT ITEM.
00:01:47.750: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  GREAT. CAN WE CONSIDER THAT FRIENDLY? SIONER SAUVE, COMMISSIONER MILLS? GREAT. ALL OF THOSE IN FAVOR OF THE AMENDED AGENDA, PLEASE SAY AYE. [ CHORUS OF AYES ] OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. MOVING ON TO MINUTES OF PREVIOUS MEETING, BEFORE US, WE HAVE THE NOVEMBER 19TH AND DECEMBER 3RD MINUTES FOR OUR APPROVAL. DO I HAVE A COMMISSIONER THAT WILL MOVE THOSE TWO? MOVED BY COMMISSIONER ABRONS, SECOND BY COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT. DO WE HAVE DISCUSSION? COMMISSIONER BRIGGS.
00:02:19.182: >> COMISSIONER BRIGGS:  JUST ONE SMALL CORRECTION. ON THE DECEMBER 3RD MEETING, IT SAYS THAT I'M ABSENT BUT IT ALSO HAS ME SAYING THINGS IN THE MEETING.
00:02:26.489: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  I AM NOT SURE HOW YOU DID THAT. SORRY. WE WILL CORRECT THAT.
00:02:30.026: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  WE WILL GET THOSE CORRECTED. ANY OTHER CHANGES TO THE MINUTES? ALL RIGHT. ALL OF THOSE IN FAVOR OF THE CORRECTED MINUTES, PLEASE SAY AYE. [ CHORUS OF AYES ] OPPOSED? ALL RIGHT. THEY ARE APPROVED. REPORTS FROM CITY ADMINISTRATION, CITY COUNCIL, PLANNING MANAGER, PLANNING COMMISSION OFFICERS, COMMITTEES, COMMUNICATIONS AND WRITTEN PETITIONS, OUR FIRST ITEM IS 6A CITY COUNCIL. COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN IS NOT HERE, SO WE WILL MOVE ON TO MR. LENART FOR THE PLANNING MANAGER REPORT.
00:03:00.390: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  A COUPLE OF ITEMS FROM CITY COUNCIL AS WELL. LAST EVENING AT THE CITY COUNCIL, THE CITY COUNCIL TABLED A PROPOSED CONTRACT TO AWARD A CONTRACT TO INTERFACE STUDIOS AS THE CITY'S CONSULTANT TO UPDATE THE CITY'S FUTURE LAND USE PLAN. THEY ARE INTERESTED IN PERHAPS A WORKING SESSION TO DIVE INTO SOME OF THE DETAILS AND POTENTIAL CHANGES TO THAT PROPOSED CONTRACT IN MORE DETAIL, SO WE'LL BE LOOKING TO RESPOND TO THAT, PROBABLY IN THE EARLY NEXT YEAR. HIDEAWAY LANE, WHICH WAS A DEVELOPMENT PROJECT THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY APPROVED -- RECOMMENDED FOR APPROVAL BY THIS BOARD WAS ALSO APPROVED. IT ALSO INCLUDED JUST -- AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK THIS BOARD HAS EXPRESSED INTEREST IN AS WELL, WITH SOME COMMENTS ABOUT REVISITING THE PLANNED PROJECT MODIFICATION COMPONENT OF OUR ORDINANCE AND THE SPECIFIC TYPES OF BENEFITS THAT WE'D LIKE TO SEE SO THAT SOME OF THOSE COMMENTS THAT YOU HAVE ADDRESSED IN THE FUTURE ARE ECHOED THERE, SO THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING WE WANT TO CONSIDER IN OUR WORK PLAN, AND A RESOLUTION THAT DIRECTS CITY STAFF AND ULTIMATELY POTENTIALLY INCORPORATION OF THE UDC, ADDITIONAL PROTECTION FOR TREES, PERHAPS THE IDENTIFICATION OF HERITAGE TREES. THAT WOULD BE A CATEGORY PERHAPS ABOVE LANDMARK TREES AND AN INCREASED AMOUNT OF PROTECTION FOR THOSE. SO THOSE ARE SOME RELATED ACTIONS FROM CITY COUNCIL LAST NIGHT, AND NOTHING FROM THE PLANNING REPORT.
00:04:26.442: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  THANK YOU. PLANNING COMMISSION OFFICERS AND COMMITTEES? ALL RIGHT. SEEING NO ONE, WRITTEN COMMUNICATIONS AND PETITIONS, WE DO HAVE SOME WRITTEN COMMUNICATIONS, SO PLEASE TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. NOW IS TIME FOR AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION. AT THIS TIME, ANY MEMBERS OF THE AUDIENCE WHO WISH TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION REGARDING AN ITEM THAT IS NOT ON THE AGENDA THIS EVENING, YOU WILL HAVE UP TO THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION. SO IF YOU ARE HERE TO ADDRESS AN ITEM NOT ON THE AGENDA THIS MEETING, PLEASE APPROACH THE PODIUM, STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS FOR THE RECORD, AND YOU WILL HAVE THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
00:05:11.888: >> KAREN WHITE. I KNOW WE ARE GOING TO BE MOVING FORWARD WITH THE MASTER PLAN REPLANNING EFFORT, BUT I'M HOPING THAT IN A SOMEWHAT SHORTER TIME FRAME, WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO INCORPORATE WAYS FOR CITIZENS TO REGISTER THOSE ELEMENTS OF THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS, THOSE NATURAL FEATURES THAT THEY FIND PARTICULARLY SIGNIFICANT AND IMPORTANT, SO THAT THEY MIGHT BE ON FILE THE PLANNING COMMISSION AND THE PLANNING OFFICE TO BE CONSIDERED AS MORE DEVELOPMENTS COME FORWARD. I DON'T WANT TO WAIT THREE OR FOUR YEARS FOR THE MASTER PLAN PROCESS TO BE FINISHED BEFORE I'M ABLE TO START ADVISING SOMEONE IN THE CITY WHO HAS TO LISTEN TO ME ABOUT, GEE, THIS IS A VERY OLD, VERY LARGE OAK. GEE, THIS IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT GROWTH. I SEE THEM ALL OVER NOW, AND NOW I'M PARANOID, SO I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN PUT IN PLACE SOME PROCEDURES FOR REGISTERING THAT SORT OF THING, MAYBE THROUGH THE FIX-IT APP, YOU KNOW, IF I TOOK A PICTURE OF EVERY FEATURE THAT I FOUND SIGNIFICANT AND COULD SUBMIT IT THROUGH THE APP. SO THAT'S SOMETHING I'M HOPING YOU'LL CONSIDER. THANKS.
00:06:31.467: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION IN REGARDS TO AN ITEM THAT IS NOT ON THE AGENDA THIS EVENING?
00:06:44.580: >> THANK YOU, CHAIR MILSHTEYN AND PLANNING COMMISSION. I'M KEN GARBER, 2387 HILLDALE. AS YOU KNOW, WE ARE IN A CLIMATE EMERGENCY. BURNING NATURAL GAS ACCOUNTS FOR 27% OF THE CITY'S EMISSIONS. OVER HALF A MILLION TONS OF CO2 EQUIVALENT EMISSIONS A YEAR. THIS GAS IS BURNED TO HEAT BUILDINGS, AND ANY SERIOUS ATTEMPT TO GET TO ZERO EMISSIONS MUST TACKLE THIS PROBLEM. WE NEED TO FULLY ELECTRIFY OUR BUILDINGS ACROSS THE CITY. WE SHOULD START WITH NEW CONSTRUCTION, SINCE IT MAKES NO SENSE TO SIGNAL GAS FURNACES AND BOILERS WITH USEFUL LIVES OF 30 YEARS, ALONG WITH BUILDING ENVELOPES DESIGNED AROUND A FOSSIL FUEL INFRASTRUCTURE, ONLY TO RIP IT ALL OUT IN TEN YEARS IN FAVOR OF GROUND SOURCE HEAT PUMP TECHNOLOGY. JUST IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS, FOUR CALIFORNIA CITIES, SAN JOSE BERKELEY, SAN LUIS OBISPO AND MENLO PARK HAVE PASSED SUCH ORDINANCES. A MONTH AGO, BROOKLINE, MASSACHUSETTS DID IT TOO. BROOKLINE'S LAW APPLIES TO BOTH NEW CONSTRUCTION AND TO MAJOR RENOVATIONS. NOW, I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING. MICHIGAN'S BUILDING CODES MUST PREEMPT SUCH A BAN. MAYBE, BUT I DON'T THINK SO. SEVERAL OF US HAVE LOOKED CAREFULLY, AND WE CANNOT FIND ANY PREEMPTIVE LANGUAGE, NOT IN THE MICHIGAN BUILDING CODE OF 2015 AND NOT IN THE AUTHORIZING LEGISLATION, THE SINGLE STATE CONSTRUCTION ACT OF 1999. THIS SAYS, QUOTE, "EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN THIS ACT, THIS ACT DOES NOT LIMIT OR RESTRICT EXISTING POWERS OR AUTHORITY OF GOVERNMENTAL SUBDIVISIONS AND THIS ACT SHALL BE ENFORCED BY GOVERNMENTAL SUBDIVISIONS IN THE MATTER DESCRIBED BY LOCAL LAW OR ORDINANCE." THIS WHOLE QUESTION HAS BEEN SENT TO THE CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE, BUT WE HAVEN'T HEARD BACK. I'M TOLD IT CAN TAKE MONTHS TO GET AN ANSWER. MAYBE MR. FROST CAN TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. IN THE MEANTIME, WE SHOULD DRAFT AN ORDINANCE. THE BROOKLINE LAW IS A GOOD STARTING POINT, BANNING NEW FOSSIL FUEL INFRASTRUCTURE. THE LAW ESTABLISHES A BOARD OF EXPERTS TO HEAR AND DECIDE WAIVERS AND APPEALS. DEVELOPERS HERE SHOULD NOT STILL BE PUTTING IN NEW FOSSIL FUEL INFRASTRUCTURE IN 2020. WE NEED TO STOP THE BLEEDING. THIS IS A NO-BRAINER TO ME. IT COSTS THE CITY NOTHING, BENEFITS DEVELOPERS IN THE LONG RUN. WE CAN'T WAIT UNTIL -- FINALIZES ITS CARBON NEUTRALITY PLAN NEXT MARCH. INCIDENTALLY, IN MY OPINION, CITY PLANNING STAFF SHOULD INFORM ALL PETITIONERS OF THE 2030 CARBON NEUTRALITY TARGET AND PUSH FOSSIL FUEL FREE BUILDINGS. WE CAN'T REQUIRE THIS YET, BUT MAYBE MAKE CLEAR THAT IT IS OUR BASELINE EXPECTATION. MAYBE MR. LENART AND HIS STAFF ARE ALREADY DOING THIS, BUT IF NOT, I THINK WE SHOULD START IMMEDIATELY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AND FOR YOUR FANTASTIC WORK.
00:09:46.996: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN THE AUDIENCE THAT WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION IN REGARDS TO AN ITEM THAT IS NOT ON THE AGENDA? SEEING NO ONE, WE'LL MOVE ON TO PUBLIC HEARINGS SCHEDULED FOR NEXT BUSINESS MEETING.
00:09:58.974: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  WE HAVE THREE PUBLIC HEARINGS SCHEDULED FOR THE NEXT BUSINESS MEETING ON JANUARY 7TH, 2020, IF YOU CAN BELIEVE IT. THE FIRST IS THE STANDARD AT ANN ARBOR. THIS IS A PROPOSED APARTMENT COMMUNITY WITH A TEN STORY STRUCTURE ON THE NORTH SIDE AND A FIVE STORY STRUCTURE ON THE REMAINING PORTION OF A 1.45 ACRE SITE ON SOUTH MAIN STREET. IT CONTAINS 200 DWELLING UNITS, RANGING FROM ONE TO FOUR BEDROOM APARTMENTS, AND TWO UNITS PROPOSED TO BE AFFORDABLE, 6200 FEET OF RETAIL SPACE AND OFF STREET PARKING SPACES. THIS IS THE DT EDISON OFFICE BUILDING ON THE CORNER OF WILLIAM AND SOUTH MAIN. WE HAVE TWO PROPOSED ANNEXATIONS AND ZONING BY PROPERTY OWNERS. ONE AT 2511 NEW PORT ROAD, AN APPLICATION TO ANNEXATION A 1.5 ACRE PARCEL FROM ANN ARBOR TOWNSHIP AND ZONE IT R1A, SINGLE-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL, IN ORDER TO ACCESS UTILITIES. NO CURRENT CHANGE IS PROPOSED FOR THE SINGLE-FAMILY USE, AND ANOTHER ANNEXATION FOR A 1.38 ACRE PARCEL BETWEEN WHITE OAK AND MAPLE BETWEEN ANN ARBOR TOWNSHIP, ZONE IT R1A, SINGLE-FAMILY RESIDENCE, AGAIN TO ACCESS UTILITIES, AND NO CHANGE OF USE IS PROPOSED.
00:11:27.463: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  THIS WILL BE A VERY EXCITING START TO OUR YEAR COME JANUARY 7TH. ALL RIGHT. UNFINISHED BUSINESS IS UP NEXT, AND THE FIRST ITEM THERE IS SIGN ORDINANCE AMENDMENTS FOR CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL, AND WE'LL BEGIN WITH MR. LENART.
00:11:42.978: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  WE DON'T HAVE A POWERPOINT PRESENTATION BECAUSE OF THE TEXT ORIENTATION OF THIS, BUT FOR MEMBERS OF THE AUDIENCE, IF YOU DIDN'T GRAB IT, WE HAVE PLENTY OF COPIES OF THE PROPOSAL AND DRAFT ORDINANCE THERE. I WANT TO SET THE STAGE AND THEN I'LL TURN IT OVER TO CHRIS CHANG FOR A BRIEF OVERVIEW. TO FRAME A COUPLE OF REMINDERS, IN 2015 THROUGH THE CASE OF REID VERSUS THE TOWN OF GILBERT, THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT DETERMINED THAT CONTENT BASED SIGNAGE REGULATIONS ARE PRESUMED TO BE UNCONSTITUTIONAL. THIS DECISION IS BASED ON FIRST AMENDMENT PRECEDENCE OF THE CONSTITUTION, WHICH PREVENTS GOVERNMENTS FROM CONTROLLING OR RESTRICTING SPEECH BASED ON ITS CONTENT. SO THE CITY HAS UNDERTAKEN THE PROCESS TO REVISE OUR SIGN ORDINANCE, AS OUR EXISTING ORDINANCE IS DECADES OLD. IT HAS BEEN AMENDED NUMEROUS TIMES, AND LIKELY INCLUDES PROVISIONS THAT WOULD NOT MEET THIS NEW PRECEDENT OF THE SUPREME COURT AND THE TEST OF REID VERSUS THE TOWN OF GILBERT. SO THE CITY HAS WORKED WITH A CONSULTANT TO DEVELOP THE MAJORITY OF THE DRAFT ORDINANCE. SINCE YOU'VE LAST SEEN IT, STAFF HAS TAKEN THAT TIME TO MAKE SOME ADDITIONAL ADJUSTMENTS AND INCORPORATE THE PROPOSED LANGUAGE OF THAT DRAFT INTO OUR UDC FORMAT, MORE CONSISTENCY, INCLUDING CONSISTENCY WITH EXISTING DEFINITIONS, HEADINGS STRUCTURE AND THE LIKE. THERE ARE ALSO SOME CHANGES THAT WE ARE GOING TO SUMMARIZE, AND BASED ON THE COMBINATION OF THOSE CHANGES, IT IS MY ASSERTION THAT THIS ORDINANCE NEEDS TO COME BACK TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION FOR RECONSIDERATION, BASED ON THE LEVEL OF CHANGES. THE PROPOSED ORDINANCE THAT WE CONTINUE TO PRESENT TO YOU, WE BELIEVE THAT WILL NOW MEET THE LEGAL PRECEDENCE SET BY THE SUPREME COURT, UTILIZING A CONTENT-NEUTRAL APPROACH. WE DO THIS GENERALLY BY IDENTIFYING OVERALL REQUIREMENTS THAT APPLY TO ALL SIGNS, THEN REGULATING THE SIZE AND TYPE OF SIGNS BY ZONING DISTRICT AND/OR USE. SPECIFICALLY, WE REGULATE THE SIGNAGE BY THE D1, D2, AND C1AR OR WHAT WE ARE ENVISIONING TO BE SORT OF OUR CORE DOWNTOWN DISTRICTS, BY OTHER MIXED USE, NONRESIDENTIAL AND SPECIAL PURPOSE DISTRICTS. THIS WOULD BE INCLUSIVE OF DISTRICTS LIKE REMAINING INDUSTRIAL, COMMERCIAL, OFFICE AND THE LIKE. AND THEN BY RESIDENTIAL, BASED ON THE NUMBER OF RESIDENTIAL UNITS OR NONRESIDENTIAL STATUS, LIKE A SCHOOL OR CHURCH OR OTHER NONRESIDENTIAL USE IN A RESIDENTIAL ZONING DISTRICT. THE ORDINANCE ALSO INTENDS TO ADDRESS CONTENT NEUTRALITY AND PROVIDE AN ACCOMMODATION AND LIMITS ON TEMPORARY SIGNS TO PROVIDE WHAT WE BELIEVE IS AN ADEQUACY OF FREE SPEECH OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL PROPERTY OWNERS IN THE CITY. SO THAT IS THE FRAMING OF SORT OF HOW WE GOT TO WHERE WE ARE AND WHY IT'S COMING BACK TO YOU. I'M GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO CHRIS TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF SOME OF THOSE CHANGES, AND THEN WE CAN ADDRESS ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE, EITHER BEFORE OR AFTER THE PUBLIC HEARING.
00:14:48.430: >> ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU, MR. LENART. AS HE HAD JUST MENTIONED, WE ARE MOVING TOWARD REGULATION BY ZONING DISTRICT IN A CONTENT-NEUTRAL MANNER. THIS REFLECTS CURRENT BEST PRACTICES IN RESPONSE TO EVOLVING COURT DECISIONS ON REGULATIONS. SOME OF THE AMENDMENTS ARE MORE SIGNIFICANT, AND THAT'S WHY WE ARE BACK HERE AT PLANNING COMMISSION, AND THEY ARE, AS LISTED IN THE STAFF REPORT, AS THE FOLLOWING. SIGNARY CALCULATION OF HEIGHT IS FORMATTED AND CALCULATED BY CODE AND SEPARATED FROM THE TABLE OF SIGN TYPES, ELIMINATING MARQUEE SIGNS. EXISTING MARQUEE SIGNS ARE NOW NONCONFORMING. WE ARE ELIMINATING THREE-FOOT SQUARE WALL SIGNS IN THE ONE AND TWO-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS, REDUCING THE MAXIMUM SIZE OF WALL SIGNS FROM THREE UNITS AND GREATER FROM 12 FEET DOWN TO SIX SQUARE FEET -- WHICH IS LISTED IN THE CODE. SOME OTHER THINGS THAT CAME UP DURING OUR REVIEW ARE QUESTIONS AND COMPARISONS FOR THE UDC SIGN ORDINANCE AMENDMENTS, WHICH ARE PROPOSED FOR OUTDOOR LIGHTING REGULATIONS, AND BY OUR ENVIRONMENTAL AND PLANNING COMMISSION, AND THE TWO SETS OF AMENDMENTS COMPARING THE SIGN CODE AND THE LIGHTING CODE ARE LIGHT TRESPASS, BOTH THE SIGN ORDINANCE AND OUTDOOR LIGHTING ORDINANCE IDENTIFY A LIMIT OF .1 FOOT CANDLE FOR LIGHT TRESPASS NEAR RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY. THE SIGN ORDINANCE RESTRICTS BY RESIDENTIALLY ZONED PROPERTY, AND THE OUTDOOR LIGHTING PROPOSAL RESTRICTS BY RESIDENTIALLY USED PROPERTY. WE CAN GO INTO THAT FURTHER IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS. THE SIGN ORDINANCE DOES NOT LIMIT TO NONRESIDENTIALLY ZONED PROPERTIES. THE PROPOSED OUTDOOR LIGHTING ORDINANCE SETS A .2-FOOT CANDLE LIMIT IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES. FULL CUTOFF FIXTURES ARE REQUIRED UNDER THE SIGN ORDINANCE AND THE PROPOSED OUTDOOR LIGHTING ORDINANCE. THE ORDINANCE LIMITS ELECTRONIC LIGHTS TO 5000 NITS DURING DAYTIME. A REVISION SUGGESTED AT THE LAST PLANNING COMMISSION REVIEW INCLUDED LIMITING ILLUMINATION, WHICH HAS BEEN REVISED TO A CONTENT NEUTRAL APPROACH. CITY STAFF HAVE NOT RECEIVED COMPLAINTS -- STAFF ANTICIPATES A PROPOSED LIGHTING ORDINANCE TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE, OR THE SIGN ORDINANCE CAN BE AMENDED IN THE FUTURE. WHAT YOU HAVE ALSO IN THE STAFF REPORT IS A CHART THAT'S LISTING OUT BY ZONING DISTRICT, AND THAT'S A BIG CHANGE FROM WHAT WAS PREVIOUSLY DONE, BUT WHAT THE CURRENT SIGN CODE IS AND WHAT THE PROPOSED SIGN CODE, WHAT WE ARE PROPOSING IF APPROVED. I'M NOT GOING TO GO THROUGH THE WHOLE CHART, BUT I'M HAPPY TO GO THROUGH IT IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS DURING OUR MEETING, AND I'M OPEN TO ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE.
00:17:52.381: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  THANK YOU. AT THIS TIME, I WOULD LIKE TO OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING ON THIS ITEM. MEMBERS OF THE AUDIENCE CAN ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION FOR UP TO THREE MINUTES. PLEASE COME UP TO THE PODIUM, STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS FOR THE RECORD, AND YOU WILL HAVE UP TO THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
00:18:08.830: >> HI. I'M SALLY, ADDRESS IS 922 PAULINE BOULEVARD, PROFESSOR OF ASTRONOMY AND ALSO LEADER OF THE MICHIGAN DARK SKIES COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION. I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT A COUPLE OF MEMBERS OF OUR GROUP ARE HERE, AND WE ARE VERY EXCITED BECAUSE THIS IS GOING TO BE ONE OF THE FIRST BIG STEPS FOR CONTROLLING LIGHT POLLUTION IN OUR COMMUNITY. I REALLY WANT TO THANK COMMISSIONERS MILLS AND COMMISSIONER BRIGGS FOR THEIR HELP WITH THIS, AND JUST HEARING WHAT WE HAVE -- WHAT YOU HAVE JUST DESCRIBED ON THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE SIGN ORDINANCE AND THE LIGHTING ORDINANCE, THAT ONE OF THEM WAS BASED ON LIMITING LIGHT TRESPASS BASED ON RESIDENTIALLY ZONED PROPERTY VERSUS RESIDENTIALLY USED PROPERTY, IT MIGHT BE DESIRABLE FOR YOU TO THINK ABOUT MAKING THOSE TWO THINGS CONSISTENT. THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT I ACTUALLY HAD TAKEN NOTE OF THAT, SO THANK YOU FOR POINTING THAT OUT. SO, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
00:19:11.927: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  THANK YOU.
00:19:16.632: >> HI. GOOD EVENING. MY NAME IS JEFF RUSHTEN FROM 1094 BRAUN. AND I JUST WANTED TO, AS A MEMBER OF THE MICHIGAN DARK SKIES, WANTED TO ADDRESS THE COMMISSION AND THANK THEM FOR THEIR SUPPORT OF DARK SKY INITIATIVES.
00:19:36.051: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  THANK YOU.
00:19:38.387: >> HI. KAREN WHITE, 2719 CRIMBROOK. I'M HERE IN TWO CAPACITIES, AS A SUPPORTER OF THE DARK SKY INITIATIVE, BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN WORKING AT THE DETROIT OBSERVATORY FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS NOW, AND I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO TRY TO OBSERVE THE SKIES IN OUR COMMUNITY AT NIGHT USING TELESCOPES. SO, YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO BE AN ASTRONOMER TO KNOW THAT THERE'S TOO MUCH LIGHT POLLUTION. AND IN MY SECOND CAPACITY, AS JUST A PRIVATE CITIZEN, I WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO SHARE WITH MY FAMILY SOME OF THE THINGS THAT SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE SEEN IN THE DARK SKY AND CURRENTLY ARE NOT WHEN YOU'RE IN ANN ARBOR AND YOU HAVE TO GO QUITE A WAYS OUT OF TOWN. SO I ENCOURAGE YOU AND APPLAUD YOU FOR TAKING THIS ON, AND I PLEASE HOPE YOU WILL TORQUE DOWN EVER MORE. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
00:20:35.644: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  THANK YOU.
00:20:40.015: >> GOOD EVENING. JEFF CROCKETT FROM 506 EAST KINGSLEY, AND I'M PLEASED TO BE HERE. I JUST WANT TO BRIEFLY SAY, BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN MONITORING PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT FOR QUITE A WHILE, WE THINK THAT THE EFFORTS MADE FOR A COMMUNITY OUTREACH, PARTICULARLY BRETT AND HIS STAFF AND CHRIS, HAVE BEEN A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT, SO WE ARE REALLY PLEASED ABOUT THAT. I SENT YOU A LETTER, I SENT YOU AN EMAIL THAT SORT OF OUTLINES A SERIES OF QUESTIONS AND SOME RECOMMENDATIONS, BUT I'M NOT GOING TO GO THROUGH ALL OF THAT. I JUST WANT TO BASICALLY SAY THAT THE PRIMARY CONCERN HERE IS ONE OF A PROCESS, AND I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT TAKES. THIS IS A COMPLICATED DOCUMENT WHEN IT GETS DOWN TO THE DETAILS OF SIGNS IN REGARDS TO RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS, AND BASICALLY, OUR PROCESS -- FIRST OF ALL, WE LIVE IN AN HISTORIC DISTRICT, AND WE ARE VERY ATTUNED TO SIGNS. IN FACT, WE PROBABLY REPORT MORE SIGN VIOLATIONS THAN MANY OTHER PEOPLE, INCLUDING ONE JUST RECENTLY. SO, WE ARE VERY SENSITIVE TO THIS, BUT WE ARE ALSO VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE STATEMENT THAT YOU MAKE IN TERMS OF THE AVOIDANCE OF NUISANCE LIGHT CONDITIONS. IT SAYS THAT THE CITY FINDS DUE TO THE CONCENTRATIONS OF PEOPLE AND THE ACTIVITIES WITHIN THE CITY, THERE IS A POTENTIAL FOR BLIGHT, PHYSICAL CLUTTER, EXCESS LIGHT NOISE AND VISUAL CLUTTER, AND WE TOTALLY AGREE WITH THAT. THE PROBLEM IS WE HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN TRYING TO GET INPUT ON THIS FOR SEVERAL YEARS, WHEN THE SIGN ORDINANCE REVISION FIRST, YOU KNOW, STARTED, AND WE HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH CHRIS QUITE FRANKLY. SO, THE LAST ITERATION OF THIS WAS AUGUST THE 1st, BEFORE THIS, SO WE WERE IN CONTACT WITH CHRIS TO TRY TO FIND OUT WHEN THIS HEARING WAS GOING TO TAKE PLACE, AND WE FOUND OUT MAYBE TWO WEEKS AGO IT WAS GOING TO BE TONIGHT. SO WE CONVENED OUR BOARD LAST WEDNESDAY NIGHT TO GO OVER WHAT WAS THEN THE MOST CURRENT ONE, AND THAT WAS THE AUGUST SIGN ORDINANCE, AND WE CAME UP, AND THAT WAS THE BASIS FOR THAT LETTER. BUT THEN WE FOUND OUT THAT THE LATEST ITERATION WASN'T GOING TO BE MADE AVAILABLE UNTIL FRIDAY AFTERNOON. IN FACT, WE FOUND OUT AT ABOUT 4:30 WHAT THE LATEST ONE WAS, AND SO WE SCRAMBLED OVER THE WEEKEND TO TRY TO READ AND UNDERSTAND, AND THAT WAS THE BASIS FOR THAT LETTER. JUST KEEP IN MIND THAT IN OUR OPINION, THERE SHOULD BE FAR MORE TIME FOR NEIGHBORHOOD GROUPS IN PARTICULAR TO SORT OF UNDERSTAND A COMPLICATED ORDINANCE LIKE THIS. IT'S NOT JUST YOU READ IT AND WE RESPOND. WE HAVE TO READ IT. WE HAVE TO MEET. WE HAVE TO THINK AND THEN RESPOND, SO WE ARE HOPING THAT THIS PROCESS CAN CHANGE IN THE FUTURE. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER CONCERNS THAT I HAVE MENTIONED, AND I GUESS THE MOST IMPORTANT OF WHICH IS TEMPORARY SIGN ORDINANCE, WHICH WE FEEL IS BASICALLY UNENFORCEABLE THE WAY IT'S STRUCTURED. BUT MY WIFE -- MY TIME IS NEARLY UP, AND MY WIFE CHRIS WILL SORT OF TAKE OVER FROM HERE. THANK YOU.
00:23:47.135: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  THANK YOU.
00:23:49.070: >> HI. I'M CHRIS CROCKETT. I'M PRESIDENT OF THE OLD 4th WARD ASSOCIATION. IF THERE'S A NEIGHBORHOOD THAT'S IMPACTED BY TEMPORARY SIGNS, IT'S OURS. WE ARE THE NEIGHBORHOOD JUST NORTH OF CAMPUS, AND WE HAVE SIGN POLLUTION. THERE ARE SOME LANDLORDS THAT ARE PARTICULARLY EGREGIOUS ABOUT THEIR USE OF SIGNS. THERE'S ONE IN PARTICULAR WHO ROUTINELY HAS AS MANY AS EIGHT TO TEN SIGNS, SUPPOSEDLY TEMPORARY SIGNS, EXCEPT THEY ARE THERE ALL THE TIME. SHE ALREADY HAS SIGNS POSTED FOR FALL RENTALS FOR NEXT YEAR. THIS IS JUST UNACCEPTABLE, AND TO PUT THE BURDEN ON THE NEIGHBHO CARE ABOUT THE NEIGHBORHOOD, THOSE OF US WHO HAVE LIVED THERE FOR DECADES, T CONSTANTLY REPORT IT, THAT IS ALSO UNACCEPTABLE. WE REALLY NE SOMETHING IN THIS ORDINANCE TO DEAL WITH THE SIGN POLLUTION. IT'S NOT ENOUGH JUST TO LIMIT THE SIZE OF PERMANENT SIGNS, AND THEN ALLOW LANDLORDS TO HAVE ANYWHERE FROM EIGHT TO TEN TEMPORARY SIGNS POSTED ALL OVER THEIR UNKEMPT LAWNS, BECAUSE THEY NEVER TAKE CARE OF THE LAWNS, NOT A BLADE OF GRASS IS PLANTED, NOT A FLOWER, NOT A SHRUB, NOTHING. IT IS JUST SIGN POLLUTION. AND I WILL -- I CAN TELL YOU THE OFFENDERS ARE, BUT WE HAVE DEALT WITH BANNER SIGNS THAT ARE ILLEGAL AND LOTS OF SIGNS THAT HAVE BEEN PERMANENT. WE HAVE GOTTEN THEM TAKEN DOWN. WE HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR THE WHOLE TIME WE HAVE LIVED IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD, AND WE REALLY WOULD LIKE SOME RELIEF FROM THIS BURDEN, AND WE HOPE THAT YOU CAN DO THIS BY MAKING -- GIVING THIS SIGN ORDINANCE SOME REAL TEETH. OUR NEIGHBORHOOD IS PROBABLY MORE AFFECTED THAN ANY OTHER RESIDENTIAL AREA BECAUSE WE ARE SO CLOSE TO CAMPUS, AND IT'S MOSTLY RENTAL, AND THE LANDLORDS WANT TO MAKE MONEY, AND SO THEY PROBABLY THINK IF THEY PUT EIGHT TO TEN SIGNS ON THEIR FRONT LAWN, THEY ARE GOING TO MAKE MONEY, AND BUT TO HAVE SIGNS AT THIS TIME OF THE YEAR ADVERTISING AVAILABILITY OF APARTMENTS FOR THE FALL OF 2020 IS JUST OUTLANDISH. IT'S NOT NECESSARY. SO WE REALLY NEED YOUR ASSISTANCE TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM, ALONG WITH OTHERS. WE WANT YOU TO REALLY TAKE A HARD LOOK AT THIS GRANDFATHERING, BECAUSE ALREADY SOME OF THE SIGNS THAT ARE POSTED ARE PRETTY AWFUL. THERE'S ONE NEW MANAGER IN TOWN THAT HAS A PERMANENT SIGN ON THE HOUSE, AND THEN ANOTHER HUGE SIGN STRUNG UP BETWEEN THE PILLARS OF THE PORCH, TOTALLY UNNECESSARY. ANY MORE, IF STUDENTS CAN GET OR ANY RENTER CAN GET THE CONTACT INFORMATION, THEY CONTACT LANDLORDS ONLINE. SO, THANK YOU. AND THANKS FOR ALL OF YOUR WORK.
00:26:55.657: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION IN REGARDS TO THIS ITEM? SEEING NO ONE, I WILL CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING AND READ THE MOTION. THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION HEREBY RECOMMENDS THAT THE MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL APPROVE AMENDMENTS TO CHAPTER 55 UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE SECTION 5.24. MOVED BY COMMISSIONER MILLS, SECOND BY COMMISSIONER WOODS. WE ARE IN DISCUSSION.
00:27:30.391: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  WHILE YOU'RE GETTING STARTED WITH YOUR COMMENTS, I WOULD LIKE TO PROPOSE A COUPLE OF AMENDMENTS, ACTUALLY, TO THE DRAFT YOU HAVE. I THINK THEY ARE FAIRLY MINOR, AND, AS USUAL, I APOLOGIZE. I AM NOTICING I DON'T HAVE PAGE NUMBERS HERE FOR YOU. THE FIRST AMENDMENT IS UNDER TEMPORARY SIGNS, SO IF YOU GO TO SECTION 5.24.7, TEMPORARY SIGNS, THEN SUB A(3), IT'S THE TITLE ON THE TOP OF THAT PAGE IS TEMPORARY FREE STANDING SIGNS. UNDER THE EXCEPTIONS, B, THERE IS A REFERENCE IN THE FINAL LINE OF UNLIMITED SIGN, THAT THE REQUIREMENTS -- SIGN IS SUBJECT TO THE PLACEMENT REQUIREMENTS AND COUNTS TOWARDS THE MAXIMUM SIGN AREA FOR FREE STANDING SIGNS PROVIDED IN TABLE 5.24-4. THAT SHOULD BE 5.2-5. WE HAD ADDED ANOTHER TABLE IN THIS DRAFT AND FAILED TO INCLUDE OR UPDATE THAT REFERENCE, SO I PROPOSE THAT CHANGE FOR THE VERSION YOU CONSIDER. AND ADDITIONALLY, WHEN YOU GO TO SECTION 3 OF THE PROPOSED -- OR SECTION 2 OF THE PROPOSED UDC ORDINANCE, WHICH IS WHERE YOU GET INTO THE SIGN PERMIT SECTION, THE TITLE OF THAT PAGE SAYS THAT SECTION OF 5.29.2, IT INCLUDES A SIGN PERMIT SUB C, DISPLAY A STREET ADDRESS. THIS IS LANGUAGE THAT ORIGINALLY WE HELD OVER FROM OUR CURRENT CODE, AND ESSENTIALLY IT'S A CHECK THAT YOU COULDN'T BE ELIGIBLE FOR A SIGN PERMIT AT A PROPERTY UNLESS YOU HAD ADEQUATELY DISPLAYED THE ACTUAL ADDRESS OF THE PROPERTY FOR WAYFINDING AND PUBLIC SAFETY. HOWEVER, INDEPENDENTLY OF THE ZONING ORDINANCE, CHAPTER TWO OF OUR CITY CODE REQUIRES THAT FOR ALL PROPERTIES, THAT AN ADDRESS BE PROVIDED, SO I THINK IT'S DUPLICATIVE TO INCLUDE IT HERE IN THE UDC, AND I WOULD SUGGEST STRIKING ITEM C.
00:29:42.223: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  WOULD THOSE BE FRIENDLY AMENDMENTS, COMMISSIONER MILLS AND WOODS?
00:29:47.962: >> YES.
00:29:48.196: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  ALL RIGHT. VERY GOOD. ALL RIGHT. WE ARE IN DISCUSSION. COMMISSIONER MILLS?
00:29:58.907: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  LEAVE IT TO THE PERSON WITHOUT MUCH A VOICE TO START, SO I'LL BE SHORT. THE FIRST THING IS ABOUT THE LIGHTING. EFFECTIVELY, I WANT TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A DISCUSSION. I APPRECIATE YOU DOING THAT COMPARISON, AND I AGREE THAT THERE'S A LOT OF PLACES WHERE THEY MATCH. YOU NOTE THAT THE LIGHTING ORDINANCE -- SO THE LIGHTING ORDINANCE, OR, I'M SORRY, THE SIGN ORDINANCE NOW IS BASED ON DISTRICT RATHER THAN USE, SO IT DOESN'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE WHAT KIND, HOW THE BUILDING IS USED IN A PARTICULAR DISTRICT. WE ALLOW RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES IN MANY OF OUR DISTRICTS. IT'S ASSIGNED TO THE DISTRICT. IS THAT RIGHT?
00:30:41.382: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  CORRECT.
00:30:42.450: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  SO, IN THAT WAY, IN MOVING EITHER -- IN MOVING TOWARDS A LIGHT TRESPASS THRESHOLD THAT IS BASED ON A DISTRICT, THERE'S LIKELY GOING TO BE -- THAT'S LESS RESTRICTIVE GENERALLY. LIKE, THERE'S GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE TRESPASS, BECAUSE THERE ARE A WHOLE LOT OF PROPERTIES IN A -- RESIDENTIALLY USED PROPERTIES IN NONRESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS. IS THAT A FAIR ASSERTION?
00:31:14.048: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  YEAH, AS IT IS DRAFTED NOW, THE MOST PROTECTIVE TRESPASS PROVISION WOULD BE WHERE YOU HAVE RESIDENTIALLY ZONED PROPERTY, WITH THE PRESUMPTION THAT THAT IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE RESIDENTIALLY USED, EXCEPT IN FEW CIRCUMSTANCES. IT DOESN'T AFFORD THE SAME PROTECTION TO A RESIDENTIALLY USED PROPERTY IN A NONRESIDENTIAL ZONE. SIMILARLY, THAT PROPERTY COULD BE USED FOR A LOT OF DIFFERENT USES, OTHER THAN RESIDENTIAL AS WELL, AND SO YOU'RE RIGHT, THAT IT IS IMPACTING RESIDENTIAL USES POTENTIALLY DIFFERENTLY, IF THERE'S A RATIONALE FOR IT, IT'S THAT A RESIDENTIAL USE WITHIN A COMMERCIAL OR MIXED-USE DISTRICT IS OF A DIFFERENT CHARACTER THAN A DISTRICT THAT MIGHT ONLY RESTRICT TO RESIDENTIAL USES SOLELY.
00:32:01.629: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  GENERALLY SPEAKING, WITHIN THE UDC, THE UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE, THAT'S OUR ZONING ORDINANCE, HOW COMMON IS IT TO SET STANDARDS BASED ON USE? LIKE, FOR EXAMPLE, THE SCREENING, LIKE THE VEGETATIVE BUFFERS, THAT KIND OF THING THAT WE HAVE, HOW MUCH OF IT IS BASED ON THE USE VERSUS THE DISTRICT THAT IT IS IN?
00:32:25.987: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  I WOULD HAVE TO SPEND SOME TIME SORT OF INVENTORYING THOSE PROVISIONS. I THINK WE HAVE INSTANCES OF BOTH, BUT I DON'T KNOW IF ONE IS MORE PREVALENT THAN OTHERS.
00:32:40.635: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  GOT IT. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS, BECAUSE THIS ENTIRE ORDINANCE IS BASED ON A DISTRICT, I DON'T NECESSARILY WANT TO CHANGE THAT ON THE FLY, BUT I THINK THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE MIGHT WANT TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT WHEN THE LIGHTING ORDINANCE COMES BEFORE US AGAIN. WHAT I JUST HEARD WAS THAT THERE WOULD BE LESS CROSS-PROPERTY LIGHT POLLUTION IF WE SET THAT TRESPASS BASED ON THE USE OF THE PROPERTY, RATHER THAN THE KIND OF DISTRICT IN WHICH IT'S IN. AGAIN, BECAUSE OF THIS ORDINANCE, THE SIGN ORDINANCE THAT'S BEFORE US TONIGHT, EVERYTHING IS SET UP BASED ON THE DISTRICT. I THINK THAT MAKES SENSE FOR TONIGHT. BUT I DON'T -- I WOULDN'T WANT TO -- I MIGHT WANT TO REVISIT THAT IN THE FUTURE. I JUST WANT TO PUT THAT IDEA OUT THERE.
00:33:34.655: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  DO YOU HAVE ANY INITIAL THOUGHTS HOW YOU WOULD CONSIDER A MIXED-USE PROPERTY? LIKE SAY YOU HAD A RETAIL SPACE WITH RESIDENTIAL ABOVE.
00:33:46.033: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  I -- I THINK IF IT'S ON THE VERY SAME PROPERTY, LIKE THEN THAT COUNTS AS A -- THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION. AND I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE TALKED ABOUT A BIT, AND SO THIS IS WHY WHEN THAT COMES BACK I THINK WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT THAT.
00:34:05.286: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  SO I THINK THAT MIGHT BE A RATIONALE TO KEEP IT AS A ZONING DISTRICT DESIGNATION, BUT THAT WOULD BE THE KIND OF QUESTION WE'D WANT TO UNDERSTAND.
00:34:13.694: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  OKAY. I'LL LET MORE PEOPLE WHO HAVE MORE OF A VOICE TALK ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE. I JUST WANTED TO GET IT OUT THERE. AND THE OTHER THING THAT I WANTED TO ASK SOME QUESTIONS ON TONIGHT, AND I APPRECIATE THE KIND OF COMPARISON, THERE IS, IF I'M READING THIS CORRECTLY, THERE IS A SUBSTANTIVE CHANGE FROM AUGUST UNTIL NOW IN THAT IN THOSE ONE AND TWO-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS, WE ARE ACTUALLY REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF SIGNAGE OVERALL THAT'S ALLOWED. IS THAT CORRECT?
00:34:45.826: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  YEAH. A CHANGE FROM THE -- SORT OF THE EVOLUTION OF THAT CHANGE FROM THE CURRENT SIGN ORDINANCE, WE HAVE A PROVISION THAT ALLOWS A SIGN ON SUCH PROPERTIES RESTRICTED TO THE ADDRESS AND THE NAMES OF THE OCCUPANTS. THAT IS OBVIOUSLY A VERY CONTENT-SPECIFIC REGULATION. OUR INITIAL DRAFT THAT WE PRESENTED TO YOU EARLIER THIS YEAR CARRIED FORWARD THAT OPPORTUNITY TO MAINTAIN A SIGN ON THOSE PROPERTIES. TALKING FROM A STAFF PERSPECTIVE AND SORT OF THE CHARACTER OF SUCH USES, WE NOW ARE RECOMMENDING THAT SORT OF APPROACHING THAT FROM A DIFFERENT LENS, WE PROVIDE ADDRESSES AND, IN FACT, REQUIRE ADDRESSING FOR PROPERTIES THAT ACCOMMODATES SIMILARLY WHAT WAS PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED AND NOW ARE REDUCING, AS YOU SAID, WHAT WAS PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED AS UP TO A THREE-SQUARE FOOT PERMANENT SIGN. NOW WE ARE NOT PROPOSING ANY SUCH PROVISION, OF PERMANENT SIGNS, FOR SINGLE AND TWO-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL.
00:35:52.860: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  GOT IT. BUT THERE IS THAT PAGE, THE FIRST EDIT THAT YOU HAD US MAKE.
00:36:02.370: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  UH-HUH.
00:36:03.271: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  WE ARE ALLOWING FOR A TEMPORARY SIGN THAT'S FOR UNLIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME, WHICH CAN YOU HELP EXPLAIN TO THE AVERAGE PERSON HOW THAT IS DIFFERENT THAN A PERMANENT SIGN? AND BY SAYING THAT IT'S FREE-STANDING, LIKE, THE WAY THAT I'M READING THIS NOW IS THAT WE KNOW THAT IN THE OLD 4th WARD AND IN OTHER AREAS AROUND CAMPUS, WHERE THERE ARE SINGLE-FAMILY HOMES THAT ARE RENTED OUT, RIGHT, OR DUPLEXES THAT ARE RENTED OUT, IT'S VERY COMMON TO HAVE A SIGN, A WALL-MOUNTED SIGN, THAT IS PERMANENT. YOU KNOW, WE WOULD ALL SEE THEM AS PERMANENT, ON THE HOUSE. IS THIS SAYING NOW THAT THEY CAN DO THAT, BUT IT HAS TO BE FREE-STANDING, AND IS THAT BETTER?
00:36:47.114: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  YEAH, IT WOULD HAVE TO BE A FREE-STANDING SIGN TO INVOKE THAT UNLIMITED DURATION POTENTIAL.
00:36:53.220: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  GOT IT. SO ALL OF THOSE, AS LONG AS THE DISTRICTS THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ARE R1 AND R2 DISTRICTS.
00:37:01.329: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  OR SINGLE OR TWO-FAMILY USES IN RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS.
00:37:06.100: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  OR SINGLE OR TWO-FAMILY USES IN AN R3 DISTRICT, R4 DISTRICT, THEN THEY WOULD HAVE TO -- THEY WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO HAVE A SIGN ON THEIR BUILDING.
00:37:20.381: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  A PERMANENT WALL SIGN, THAT'S CORRECT.
00:37:24.018: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  A PERMANENT WALL SIGN ON THEIR BUILDING. THEY COULD HAVE A TEMPORARY ONE, BUT IT COULD BE TAKEN DOWN FOR 30 DAYS AND PUT BACK UP FOR TWO MONTHS.
00:37:34.995: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  CORRECT.
00:37:35.663: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  CAN YOU TALK, ONE, THROUGH THE ENFORCEMENT OF THAT, AND TWO, WHAT'S THE RATIONALE FOR ALLOWING THE DEFINITION OF UNLIMITED TEMPORARY FREE STANDING SIGN?
00:37:45.339: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  SO, ENFORCEMENT FOR SURE WILL BE CHALLENGING, ALTHOUGH RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A LOT OF PROVISIONS FOR TEMPORARY SIGNAGES ON A CONTENT-SPECIFIC THAT HAVE -- THAT ARE EQUALLY DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE. WE, LIKE ANYTHING, WE TEND TO BE COMPLAINT DRIVEN. I THINK I FORWARDED RESPONSES TO YOU THAT WE HAD RECEIVED A QUESTION ABOUT THAT. I DON'T PROFESS THAT THIS IS EASY OR AUTOMATIC. WE WOULD HAVE TO ULTIMATELY DOCUMENT THAT SOMETHING IS EXCEEDING THAT DURATION OF ENFORCEMENT. AND REMIND ME AGAIN OF YOUR SECOND QUESTION?
00:38:29.583: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  THE RATIONALE BEHIND HAVING SOMETHING THAT'S IDENTIFIED AS A TEMPORARY SIGN WITH AN UNLIMITED DURATION.
00:38:35.723: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  OH, YEAH. BY RESTRICTING -- PARTICULARLY BY RESTRICTING SINGLE-FAMILY PROPERTIES AND DUPLEX PROPERTIES FROM HAVING A PERMANENT SIGN, WE, WITH ANY CONTENT NEUTRALITY -- KEEP IN MIND, WE ARE TRYING TO FIND A PHYSICAL REGULATION BASED ON A GEOGRAPHY OR ZONES. WE NO LONGER ARE DISTINGUISHING THAT A REAL ESTATE SIGN IS REGULATED DIFFERENTLY FROM A POLITICAL SIGN, AND WE THINK THAT A BALANCE OF FREE SPEECH AVAILABLE TO ALL PROPERTY OWNERS IS IMPORTANT, AND WE THINK THAT THIS IS A RELATIVELY UNOBTRUSIVE WAY TO ACCOMMODATE THAT. IF YOU, FOR EXAMPLE, WHETHER -- SAY YOU HAD A SIGN THAT S SAYS "THIS HOUSE SUPPORTS IMMIGRANTS AND REFUGEES," THAT WE ARE PROVIDING SOME OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU, IN THIS CASE, AS A SINGLE-FAMILY PROPERTY OWNER TO HAVE AT LEAST A SMALL PORTION OF UNLIMITED DISPLAY OF SOME MESSAGE THAT WE ARE SOMEWHAT OBLIVIOUS TO AS TO WHAT ITS CONTENT IS, AND THAT IS IN A TEMPORARY FASHION, WHICH MEANS IT CAN'T BE LIT, IT HAS TO BE UNDER A CERTAIN SIZE AND OTHER RESTRICTIONS.
00:39:58.172: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  GOT IT. THANKS. AND THERE'S ONE MORE QUESTION, BECAUSE I DID READ SOME OF THE LETTERS THAT CAME IN, AND THE ONE WAS ABOUT THE SIGNS, EFFECTIVELY ENTRANCES INTO SUBDIVISIONS, WHERE IT SAYS YOU'RE ENTERING WHATEVER ESTATES OR WHATEVER. SO, WOULD THIS THEN -- HOW DOES THIS APPLY TO THOSE SUBDIVISIONS?
00:40:20.060: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  YEAH, RIGHT NOW, WE PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL SIGN FOR MULTIFAMILY WHEN IT IS OVER FIVE UNITS, I BELIEVE. I'M LOOKING FOR ACKNOWLEDGEMENT -- OF A PERMANENT SIGN. SO, FOR LARGE RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS, YOU WOULD GET AN ADDITIONAL 50-SQUARE FOOT FREE-STANDING SIGN, SO WE ARE LIMITING SUCH OCCURRENCE TO A MULTIFAMILY, ONLY TO LARGE MULTIFAMILY. FOR A SINGLE-FAMILY DEVELOPMENT SUCH AS THAT, IT WOULD LIKELY NOT MEET THAT TEST AND WOULD NOT BE ELIGIBLE FOR A MONUMENT SIGN.
00:41:04.705: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  I'M OKAY WITH THAT, BUT I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE KNOW NOW THAT THAT WOULD BE A CHANGE. AND, AGAIN, THE SIGNS OUT THERE FOR THE SINGLE-FAMILY DEVELOPMENTS, I CAN'T THINK OF ONE, BUT I CAN ONLY THINK OF FROM MY HOMETOWN, BECAUSE YOU DON'T SEE THEM DOWNTOWN, RIGHT? IT'S MORE ON THE PERIPHERY, KIND OF THE SUBURBAN DESIGN. THOSE ARE NOT -- THOSE WOULD BE NONCONFORMING, AND THEY ARE OKAY UNTIL --
00:41:32.433: >> THEY WOULD BE SUBJECT TO ALL OF THE NONCONFORMING REQUIREMENTS, LIKE MAINTENANCE. IF THEY WERE EVER WHOLLY REMOVED, THEY COULD NOT BE REESTABLISHED.
00:41:40.474: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  GOT IT. THANK YOU. GOT IT.
00:41:50.551: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN: COMMISSIONER SAUVE?
00:41:51.452: >> COMMISSIONER SAUVE:  I'LL START WITH SOME CLARIFYING. I HAD A QUESTION, LIKE, BILLBOARDS MARQUEES, GRANDFATHERED IN SIGNS, AS IT RELATES TO REGULATING CONTENT, SO IT SAYS THAT BILLBOARDS ARE NO LONGER ALLOWED, BUT -- RIGHT? AND SO -- BUT THOSE ARE CHANGING, SO IF I LOOK AT THE PROPOSED SIGN ORDINANCE, ON AND OFF PREMISES SIGNS NO LONGER REGULATE SEPARATELY. PREVIOUSLY APPROVED BILLBOARDS MAY REMAIN. NO NEW BILLBOARDS OR SIGNS OVER 200 SQUARE FEET. SO IN CONTEXT LIKE THAT, THE CONTENT IS STILL CHANGING ALLOWED ON THAT PHYSICAL BILLBOARD?
00:42:37.531: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  YES.
00:42:42.403: >> SO IS THAT THE SAME THAT THE CONTENT WITHIN THE PHYSICAL SIGN AREA MAY BE CHANGED? WHERE IS THAT LINE OF MODIFICATION OF A GRANDFATHERED SIGN?
00:42:50.644: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  YEAH. IN THE MARQUEES, CERTAINLY WE HAVE A LOT OF -- THE MARQUEES THAT WE HAVE DO HAVE EXISTING CHANGEABLE COPY. THE CHANGEABLE COPY OF THOSE WOULD CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO BE CHANGED. I JUST WANTED TO GO TO THE NONCONFORMING SECTION TO SEE IF THERE WAS SOMETHING MORE SUBSTANTIAL, LIKE IF YOU HAD TO --
00:43:10.798: >> COMMISSIONER SAUVE:  IF THERE'S LIKE A HAND-PAINTED ANTIQUE MARQUEE, YOU COULD PAINT A NEW NAME OR A NEW MESSAGE ON IT.
00:43:20.441: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  CAN YOU THINK OF A HAND-PAINTED MARQUEE THAT WE HAVE?
00:43:24.978: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  THE McKINLEY MARQUEE.
00:43:30.084: >> COMMISSIONER SAUVE:  YEAH, THAT ONE WOULD BE ONE.
00:43:33.287: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  WHERE?
00:43:34.288: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  THE McKINLEY BUILDING.
00:43:39.593: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  TO BE CLEAR, AWNING AND CANOPY SIGNS ARE TOTALLY ALLOWED. WE ARE MORE THINKING ABOUT THE MARQUEES AT LIKE THE MICHIGAN THEATER, THE STATE THEATER. WE USED TO COMPARE THEM TO AN AWNING OR CANOPY. THEY ARE SIGNS ON A PROJECTION FROM THE BUILDING.
00:43:59.680: >> COMMISSIONER SAUVE:  SO WHAT WOULD BE THE BEER DRIVE-THROUGH OR THE WEST GATE OR THE ARBORLAND OR MORGAN AND YORK?
00:44:09.323: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  MORGAN AND YORK WOULD BE A FREE-STANDING SIGN.
00:44:14.828: >> COMMISSIONER SAUVE:  OKAY.
00:44:15.429: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  BEER DEPOT WOULD BE A FREE STANDING SIGN.
00:44:18.565: >> COMMISSIONER SAUVE:  AND HOW ARE THOSE CHANGES FOR...
00:44:23.237: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  SO THOSE WOULD BE -- THOSE ARE NONCONFORMING SIGNS. THEY CAN BE MAINTAINED, BUT IF THEY WERE TO BE RECONSTRUCTED, THEY WOULD HAVE TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF SIZE, SETBACK FROM THE PROPERTY LINE, DEPENDING ON THEIR HEIGHT.
00:44:35.215: >> COMMISSIONER SAUVE:  I GUESS IT GOES -- BECAUSE THE BILLBOARD WE KNOW IS A CHANGEABLE SIGN.
00:44:40.154: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  UH-HUH.
00:44:41.155: >> COMMISSIONER SAUVE:  VERSUS ANOTHER KIND OF NONCONFORMING SIGN THAT YOU MIGHT CHANGE THE CONTENT OF, SO I GUESS THAT'S THE QUESTION OF KNOWING THE TYPE OF SIGN FOR CHANGEABLE -- CHANGEABILITY IN GRANDFATHERED IN AND HOW THAT'S REGULATED OR LOOKED AT.
00:44:59.306: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  SO, I WANT TO UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION. SO A DISTINCTION BETWEEN BEING ABLE TO CHANGE THE CONTENT OF A NONCONFORMING BILLBOARD VERSUS IF MORGAN AND YORK BECAME LISA'S BEER EMPORIUM.
00:45:22.563: >> COMMISSIONER SAUVE:  YES. OKAY. THAT'S FUN.
00:45:27.401: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  SHALL BE MAINTAINED AND REPAIRED IN THE SAME FORM AND TYPE. CAN'T CHANGE IT TO ANOTHER NONCONFORMING SIGN. SHALL HAVE ANY CHANGE MADE IN THE SIGN'S STRUCTURE. YOU CAN'T MAKE ANY CHANGE TO THE SHAPE, TYPE, DESIGN, OR MECHANICAL EQUIPMENT. SHALL BE -- ANY CHANGE THAT WOULD RESULT IN A DIFFERENT TYPE OF GREATER ILLUMINATION -- I THINK --
00:45:55.329: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  I THINK IT'S THERE ON 5.29.2(B), NO PERMIT IS REQUIRED FOR CHANGING THE CHANGEABLE COPY OF THE SIGN UNLESS THE CHANGEABLE COPY IS BEING REPLACED WITH A PERMANENT SIGN.
00:46:10.143: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  YEAH. I -- I GUESS THAT'S A QUESTION I WOULD WANT TO GO THROUGH A COUPLE OF SCENARIOS, LIKE OF THOSE EXAMPLES, TO MAKE SURE IT WORKS, BUT IN SHORT, I DO THINK THAT YOU COULD REPLACE THE SIGN. HOWEVER, IF YOU WERE TO CHANGE THE SHAPE OR INCREASE THE SIZE OR MAKE IT BRIGHTER, THEN YOU WOULD LIKELY NOT BE ALLOWED TO DO THAT.
00:46:42.442: >> COMMISSIONER SAUVE:  IT JUST SEEMED LIKE BILLBOARDS WERE A VERY OBVIOUS THING, THAT THEY ARE NOW RESTRICTED, BUT THE ONES THAT EXIST ARE COMPLETELY CHANGEABLE.
00:46:50.284: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  YEAH, BUT I THINK YOU'RE ALSO -- NO, I THINK THAT'S TRUE. AND WE COULD WORK ON SOME CLARITY TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT IS CLEAR. I'M JUST TRYING TO -- I'M ALSO TRYING TO RECONCILE SOME OF THE PARTICULAR EXAMPLES YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT I KNOW ALSO MIGHT HAVE HAD VARIANCES IN THE PAST. I'M ALSO THINKING RECENTLY, FOR EXAMPLE, ARBORLAND WANTED TO CHANGE, AND THAT ALSO REQUIRED A VARIANCE, BECAUSE IT DIDN'T MEET THIS EXCEPTION.
00:47:21.648: >> COMMISSIONER SAUVE:  RIGHT.
00:47:22.416: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  THOSE, TO BE CLEAR, WE HAVE THAT APPEAL PROCESS BUILT IN IF SOMEBODY CAN'T MEET THIS IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCE, BUT I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING, AND I GUESS I WOULD WANT TO -- I COULD SPEND SOME MORE TIME SOME SCENARIOS, JUST AND MAYBE BRING YOU BACK SOME EXAMPLES OF HOW IT WOULD APPLY IN SOME OF THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES AS SORT OF CASES.
00:47:43.437: >> COMMISSIONER SAUVE:  YEAH, JUST BECAUSE BILLBOARDS SEEMED LIKE A VERY OBVIOUS CHANGEABLE COPY IN A GRANDFATHERED CONDITION. WHERE THAT MIGHT PLAY OUT IN SOME OTHER TYPES OF CHANGES IN THE GRANDFATHERING IN CLAUSE, BECAUSE IT SEEMS OBVIOUS WITH BILLBOARD, BUT THEN I DON'T KNOW HOW IT TRICKLES THROUGH EVERYTHING ELSE, SO THAT WAS KIND OF SOMETHING THAT I THINK WOULD HELP. I THINK ON LIGHT TRESPASS, LIKE GENERALLY MY POSITION OF THE SIGN ORDINANCE HERE NOW IS THAT THIS IS MAKING PROGRESS, AND THAT THE PROGRESS WILL NEED TO BE, YOU KNOW, TWEAKED AND AMENDED IN THE FUTURE AS WELL, BUT WORKING FROM A CONTENT-REGULATED SIGN ORDINANCE TO SOMETHING THAT IS CONTENT-NEUTRAL FOR THINGS LIKE THE RESIDENTIAL ZONE VERSUS RESIDENTIAL USE. I SAY WE START AT ZONE, AND AS WE SEE CONDITIONS, AND MAYBE IT'S THE SAME WITH THE CONTENT, YOU KNOW, BILLBOARDS VERSUS SOMETHING ELSE, THAT WE START TO MOVE THE NEEDLE BY SETTING A NEW FORMAT GENERALLY. SO I APPRECIATE THIS COMING BACK AND TRYING TO CLEAN IT UP AND GET CLARITY GENERALLY. THANK YOU.
00:48:54.975: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN: COMMISSIONER BRIGGS.
00:48:55.909: >> COMMISSIONER BRIGGS:  YEAH, JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON THE LIGHTING ISSUE WITH ZONES RATHER THAN USES, I -- I THINK IT'S PERHAPS, YOU KNOW, STILL APPROPRIATE FOR US TO BE USING THE ZONES IN RELATIONSHIP TO THE SIGNS, BUT CERTAINLY WITH THE OUTDOOR LIGHTING PROPOSAL, I THINK I WOULD HOPE THAT WE COULD CONTINUE WITH THE RESIDENTIAL USE THERE. I THINK THAT IT IS MORE PERTINENT IN THAT CASE TO HAVE US THINKING ABOUT USES, ESPECIALLY AS WE ARE MOVING OUR CITY IN GENERAL, THINKING ABOUT HAVING MORE MIXED USE PROPERTIES ACROSS THE CITY, AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO BE THINKING ABOUT LIGHT TRESPASS EVERYWHERE THAT PEOPLE LIVE, NOT JUST IN RESIDENTIAL ZONES. SO ON THAT, IN TERMS OF SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT GOT BROUGHT UP IN TERMS OF THE OLD FOURTH WARD, CHRIS, DO YOU MIND -- I KNOW THAT THERE WERE SOME ANSWERS THAT CAME OUT TO US. I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH THOSE WERE CONVEYED IN ADVANCE TO OLD FOURTH WARD, OR IF IT'S USEFUL TO GO THROUGH THOSE ANSWERS PUBLICLY RIGHT NOW.
00:50:07.614: >> I DON'T HAVE A COPY OF THE RESPONSES.
00:50:10.550: >> YEAH.
00:50:10.817: >> BUT I DO KNOW THAT WE HAD CRAFTED AND SENT THEM OUT LATER TODAY TO THE PUBLIC, BUT IF YOU HAVE GOT THEM, I DON'T MIND IF THEY ARE SHARED PUBLICLY, MR. LENART.
00:50:26.199: >> COMMISSIONER BRIGGS:  GOT IT.
00:50:26.867: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  I CAN SUMMARIZE. THE RESPONSES WERE FORWARDED TO THEM, AND SHORTLY AFTER THE RESPONSES WERE SENT TO ALL OF THE COMMISSIONERS. I KNOW THE CROCKETTS WERE ON THAT EMAIL AND SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLE AS WELL.
00:50:38.578: >> COMMISSIONER BRIGGS:  GREAT, AND IN TERMS OF AFTER THIS PASSES TONIGHT -- I SHOULD SAY IF THIS PASSES TONIGHT, WHAT WOULD BE THE NEXT STEPS IN TERMS OF WHEN IT WOULD BE GOING TO COUNCIL AND WHAT'S THAT TIMELINE LOOK LIKE?
00:50:52.092: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  PROBABLY THE EARLIEST IT WOULD PROGRESS TO COUNCIL WOULD BE A FIRST READING AT THE SECOND JANUARY MEETING OF CITY COUNCIL, OR THE FIRST FEBRUARY MEETING. SO THAT WOULD BE MY ESTIMATE, ONE OF THOSE MEETINGS FOR THE FIRST MEETING, AND THEN IT WOULD REQUIRE A MONTH DELAY BEFORE THE SECOND MEETING AND PUBLIC HEARING. SO I GUESS FINAL CONSIDERATION AND PUBLIC HEARING AT CITY COUNCIL, IF RECOMMENDED FOR APPROVAL THIS EVENING, WOULD BE EITHER THE SECOND MEETING IN FEBRUARY OR THE FIRST MEETING IN MARCH.
00:51:30.463: >> COMMISSIONER BRIGGS:  GREAT. IN TERMS OF THE CONCERNS THAT SORT OF WERE RAISED THIS EVENING, IN TERMS OF PROCESS, AND I AM SYMPATHETIC, BECAUSE I SPEND MY DAY JOB REVIEWING SIGN ORDINANCES AND LIGHTING ORDINANCES AND THINGS LIKE THAT, AND I KNOW IT IS VERY TEDIOUS AND ALSO VERY CHALLENGING TO JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF DAYS TO BE ABLE TO KIND OF GO OVER THOSE AND REVIEW THEM AND UNDERSTAND WHAT THOSE SUBSTANTIVE CHANGES MIGHT LOOK LIKE. I THINK STAFF DID A GREAT JOB IN TERMS OF IDENTIFYING WHAT THOSE SUBSTANTIVE CHANGES LOOK LIKE AND ALSO LOOKING AT THE DIRECTION THAT THOSE CHANGES ARE HEADED. I THINK THAT THEY ARE MORE RESTRICTIVE RATHER THAN MORE PERMISSIVE, WHICH I THINK IS BENEFICIAL TO THE COMMUNITY, AND I AM REASSURED TO SOME DEGREE THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE A GOOD CHUNK OF TIME, ESPECIALLY OVER THE HOLIDAYS, TO -- YOU KNOW, A GOOD MONTH TO BE ABLE TO REVIEW THIS MORE BEFORE FIRST READING, IF ANYTHING REALLY SUBSTANTIVE SHOULD POP OUT, I THINK THAT WE HAVE A PRETTY RECEPTIVE COUNCIL TO LISTENING TO CONCERNS THAT GET RAISED. SO HOPEFULLY NOTHING GETS OBSERVED IN THAT TIME PERIOD, BUT I THINK THERE IS STILL OPPORTUNITY FOR, YOU KNOW, CHANGES IF SOMETHING ODD GETS NOTICED IN THAT TIME PERIOD. IN TERMS OF ENFORCEMENT AND HOW THOSE -- HAS ANYTHING CHANGED IN TERMS OF THE ABILITY FOR THE CITY TO ENFORCE OR FINES IN TERMS OF THE UPDATE FOR THE SIGN ORDINANCE?
00:53:06.793: >> I DON'T BELIEVE THERE ARE ANY CHANGES TO THE AMOUNTS OF THE FINES. AS FAR AS ENFORCEMENT, WHICH WAS ALREADY MENTIONED, IT IS CHALLENGING. WE DO HAVE SOMEBODY ON STAFF THAT DOES GO OUT AND RESPOND, HOPEFULLY IN A TIMELY FASHION, TO MAKE CORRECTIONS BEFORE WE DO ISSUE A TICKET. BUT IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE, AS PREVIOUSLY STATED, COMPLAINT-DRIVEN. ONCE WE RECEIVE COMPLAINTS, THAT'S WHEN WE CAN REALLY START OUR FOLLOW-UP.
00:53:35.889: >> COMMISSIONER BRIGGS:  OH, AND WHAT WAS THE RATIONALE IN TERMS OF ELIMINATING MARQUEE SIGNS?
00:53:45.465: >> WELL, AS WAS PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED, THERE'S NOT A WHOLE LOT OF MARQUEE SIGNS OUT THERE. IF THERE WERE ANY CHANGES NEEDED, YOU COULD ALWAYS GO BACK TO THE ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS, AND WE STILL HAVE CANOPY AND AWNING SIGNS, GETTING SOMEONE TO COME OUT FOR APPROVAL OF THOSE SIGNS.
00:54:01.681: >> COMMISSIONER BRIGGS:  SORRY IF I MISSED THAT EXPLANATION EARLIER. OKAY. THANKS.
00:54:09.956: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN: COMMISSIONER ABRONS.
00:54:10.890: >> COMMISSIONER ABRONS:  MAYBE I JUST WANTED TO BEGIN WITH A COUPLE OF CLARIFICATION QUESTIONS. LIKE I NOTICED IN THE LIST OF PROHIBITED SIGNS 5.2.43(C) INCLUDES EXTERIOR PENDANTS, AND I'M WONDERING IF THAT INCLUDES FLAGS, WHETHER THOSE ARE ATHLETIC OR OTHER RELATED, HOLIDAY -- AND I'M ALSO WONDERING WHERE THINGS LIKE HOLIDAY DECORATIONS FALL IN ANY OF THIS.
00:54:47.961: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  THE PENNANTS THAT WE WOULD TYPICALLY INTERPRET THEM TO BE OUR SIGN PENNANTS, OFTENTIMES WE SEE THEM ON COMMERCIAL BUSINESSES. THEY TEND TO BE STRUNG ALONG PROPERTY LINES OR MAYBE BETWEEN BUILDINGS. THERE WOULD BE, HOWEVER, IT IS CONCEIVABLE THAT SOME TEMPORARY SIGN, WALL SIGN COULD BE IN THE FORM OF A PENNANT, BUT OUR INTENTION IS SORT OF THOSE THAT ARE STRUNG.
00:55:15.855: >> COMMISSIONER ABRONS:  SO NOT A FLAG THAT'S RAISED BY A POLE, HAS AN M ON IT OR AN S OR A RAINBOW?
00:55:24.931: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  FLAGS --
00:55:25.598: >> IF I MAY, THE PENNANTS ARE ALSO DEFINED IN THE DEFINITIONS.
00:55:31.805: >> COMMISSIONER ABRONS:  THEY ARE? OH, I'M SORRY. I APOLOGIZE. I DIDN'T SEE THAT. TRIANGULAR OR IRREGULAR, SO NOT RECTANGULAR.
00:55:45.585: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  YEAH, I THINK THAT WAS AN INTENTION TO -- WE HAVE HAD, AGAIN, HAVE SOME ISSUES WITH LIKE WHERE THEY ARE JUST SORT OF STRUNG TO DRAW ATTENTION TO A PROPERTY, LESS INTENDED TO DEFINE AS A SINGLE TEMPORARY SIGN BUT MORE OF LINEAR FLAGS IS AN EXCELLENT QUESTION. PREVIOUSLY, WE HAD PROVIDED FLAGS AS AN EXCEPTION. I THINK NOW THEY WOULD BE INCORPORATED.
00:56:20.620: >> COMMISSIONER ABRONS:  YOU KNOW, MY DEFINITIONS ARE MISSING D, E, F, G AND H.
00:56:29.929: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  BECAUSE WE MADE NO CHANGES TO THOSE LETTERS.
00:56:33.933: >> COMMISSIONER ABRONS:  SO FLAGS MAY BE DEFINED IN THERE.
00:56:48.081: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  SO FLAGPOLES ARE CLEARLY ALLOWED IN ALL ZONING DISTRICTS. MY INITIAL REACTION IS THAT BECAUSE WE CLEARLY ALLOW THOSE AS A STRUCTURE IN ZONING DISTRICTS ON ANY PROPERTY THAT I THINK IT WOULD BE A LOGICAL INTERPRETATION THAT WE WOULDN'T REQUIRE YOU TO PUT A FLAGPOLE UP WITHOUT THE FLAG, SO I THINK THAT'S --
00:57:16.743: >> COMMISSIONER ABRONS:  FLAGS ARE OKAY.
00:57:18.912: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  YEAH.
00:57:19.779: >> COMMISSIONER ABRONS:  AND MAYBE RETURNING TO PENNANTS FOR A MOMENT, A RESIDENT COULD NOT HANG LIKE ONE STRAND OF TIBETAN PRAYER FLAGS OR SOMETHING ON THEIR PORCH?
00:57:32.058: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  IF IT DIDN'T MEET THE TEMPORARY SIGN REQUIREMENT, NO.
00:57:36.462: >> COMMISSIONER ABRONS:  IF SOMEBODY COMPLAINED. ALL RIGHT. AND MY NEXT QUESTION RELATES TO 24(A), CALCULATING THE AREA OF FREE STANDING SIGNS, THE LAST EXAMPLE GIVEN SHOWS A NONILLUMINATED SIGN, AND I WONDERED WHAT THE RATIONALE WAS BEHIND HOW THE SIGN AREA IS MEASURED. ONE COULD SEE A VERSION OF THIS WHERE THE ACTUAL SIGN STRUCTURE IS MUCH LARGER THAN WHAT'S ILLUSTRATED HERE, BUT THE SIGN AREA WOULD STILL BE SMALL.
00:58:06.392: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  YEAH, SO THE INTENTION THERE IS THAT IF IT IS NOT ILLUMINATED, ESSENTIALLY, WE'D BE PROVIDING SORT OF POTENTIALLY MORE SIGN AREA FOR THAT DEFINITION. HOWEVER, IF YOU GO TO THE EXAMPLE ABOVE, AND IT WAS BACK LIT, FOR EXAMPLE, IN A LIGHT BOX, WE WOULD BE COUNTING THE WHOLE. IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THE STRUCTURE, ELSEWHERE IN THE CODE, IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THAT STRUCTURE HOLDING THE SIGN IS MORE THAN THREE TIMES THE AREA OF THE SIGN, THEN WE WOULD THEN PROCEED TO COUNT THE FULL SIZE OF THAT STRUCTURE TOWARDS THE SIGN DEFINITION. SO IT'S IN SHORT SORT OF A SMALL INCENTIVE, IF YOU WILL, TO NOT ILLUMINATE YOUR SIGN.
00:58:53.239: >> COMMISSIONER ABRONS:  THAT ALLOWS YOU TO HAVE A LARGER SIGN UP TO A PROPORTION. OKAY. AND THEN I HAD A QUESTION, A CLARIFICATION QUESTION ABOUT WINDOW SIGNS AND WHICH ARE DESCRIBED IN 5.24.6. I WONDERED ABOUT PERFORATED VINYL WINDOW CLING, WHICH IN THEORY CAN COVER -- I MEAN, YOU KNOW, COVER AN ENTIRE WINDOW. I GUESS I JUST WONDERED WHETHER THAT COUNTED AS A SIGN, LIKE A GRAPHIC, BECAUSE I ALSO NOTICED IN HERE THAT LIKE WINDOW -- THINGS ON DISPLAY -- GOODS ON DISPLAY DON'T COUNT.
00:59:39.452: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  CORRECT.
00:59:40.887: >> COMMISSIONER ABRONS:  I KNOW I'M GETTING NITPICKY HERE, BUT I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF NUANCE, AND I KNOW THERE ARE REAL ESTATE AGENTS WHO FILL THE WINDOW WITH SIGNAGE OF PROPERTIES THAT THEY HAVE FOR SALE OR FOR RENT, AND WOULD THAT BE CONSIDERED GOODS ON DISPLAY OR A WINDOW SIGN, A SIGN IN A WINDOW?
01:00:00.940: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  SO THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED SIGNAGE. WE WOULD CERTAINLY LOOK AT ANY CIRCUMSTANCE AND MAKE THAT DETERMINATION. AS IT RELATES TO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT WINDOW FILM, THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE ENCOUNTER QUITE A BIT. WE, FOR EXAMPLE, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DEBATED IN PUTTING TOGETHER THIS LANGUAGE WAS WOULD WE RESTRICT WALL SIGNAGE TO NO MORE THAN 25% PER WINDOW? THAT IS, YOU WOULD NEVER BE ALLOWED TO FILL UP MORE THAN 25% OF ANY INDIVIDUAL WINDOW? WE OPTED FOR THIS APPROACH, WHICH WOULD POTENTIALLY ALLOW YOU TO CONSOLIDATE THE AREA, IF YOU HAD FOUR WINDOWS, YOU COULD COVER ONE WINDOW WITH GRAPHICS. THIS DOES NOT PROHIBIT YOU FROM POTENTIALLY BLACKING OUT WINDOWS WITH A VINYL FILM, SO LONG AS IT'S NOT SIGNAGE, AND YOU WILL SEE THAT CIRCUMSTANCE IN THE CITY IN SOME CASES. SOMETIMES IT CAN BE CHALLENGING TO -- IF IT'S JUST LIKE A SOLID COLOR, THAT'S ONE THING. SOMETIMES, IN THE PAST, WE HAVE HAD TO MAKE JUDGMENTS ABOUT WHETHER THAT IS -- SUCH PRODUCTING INCLUDES SOME GRAPHIC AND WHETHER IT'S ACTING AS SIGNAGE OR ART, AND FRANKLY, THOSE ARE SOME OF THE CHALLENGING INTERPRETATIONS THAT WE OCCASIONALLY HAVE TO MAKE. BUT, TO BE CLEAR, THIS WOULDN'T PROHIBIT SORT OF BLACKING OUT A WINDOW. IT WOULD RESTRICT MORE THAN 25% OF THAT WINDOW AREA FROM BEING FILLED WITH SIGNAGE.
01:01:29.829: >> COMMISSIONER ABRONS:  OKAY. THAT'S IT FOR NOW. THANK YOU.
01:01:34.433: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN: COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT.
01:01:35.468: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT: FOLLOWING UP ON THAT, JUST FOR CLARIFICATION TOO, ARE WE TALKING ABOUT JUST THE FRONT OF BUILDINGS? OR IS THIS ANY LIKE -- I GUESS I'M THINKING NOW ABOUT PURELY RESIDENTIAL, BUT, YOU KNOW, CAN YOU HANG PENNANTS IN YOUR BACKYARD?
01:01:55.221: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  SO WE -- THIS IS -- THE -- THE WINDOW AREA IS CALCULATED BY GROUND FLOOR BUSINESS FRONTAGE. WE DID DISCUSS WHETHER OR NOT TO SPECIFICALLY PROVIDE REGULATIONS AROUND RESIDENTIAL WINDOWS AND OPTED NOT. WE DON'T HAVE THOSE KIND OF RESTRICTIONS IN PLACE, SO WE ARE NOT PROPOSING TO INVOKE ANY ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS NOW. AGAIN, I WOULD PUT THAT IN AN INTERPRETIVE CHALLENGE. IT'S CONCEIVABLE THAT YOU COULD PUT UP A BUDWEISER FLAG IN YOUR WINDOW AT SOME POINT.
01:02:37.563: >> NOT [ OFF MIC ] ACTUALLY [ LAUGHTER ].
01:02:38.898: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  WE WOULD HAVE TO MAKE A DETERMINATION IN THAT CASE, BUT WE ARE NOT SPECIFICALLY REGULATING RESIDENTIAL WINDOW SIGNAGE.
01:02:44.537: >> I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO JUST CHIME IN ALSO. WE ARE ONLY GOING TO REGULATE SIGNS VISIBLE FROM THE PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY OR FROM PUBLIC S.
01:02:56.549: >> I THINK NOW I'M THINKING ABOUT THE OLD FOURTH WARD MORE, AND I'M THINKING SPECIFICALLY ABOUT CAN THESE TEMPORARY FREE-STANDING UNLIMITED SIGNS -- SO, LANDLORDS OR BUILDING PROPERTY MANAGERS WHO HAVE SIGNS ON THEIR BUILDINGS, THAT WILL BE NONCONFORMING, RIGHT?
01:03:15.201: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  IF IT IS A ONE OR TWO FAMILY, OR IF IT IS A THREE OR MORE UNIT AND IT IS OVER SIX SQUARE FEET.
01:03:23.309: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT: OKAY. SO LET'S PRETEND THESE ARE ALL SINGLE OR ONE OR TWO-FAMILY HOUSES. THOSE CAN'T BE THERE ANYMORE, IF THEY WANTED TO TAKE THEM DOWN, BUT THEY COULD, IF IT NEEDED TO COME DOWN FOR SOME REASON AND THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO PUT IT BACK UP, THEY COULD HAVE ONE TEMPORARY FREE-STANDING SIGN? OR IS THAT A COMMERCIAL MESSAGE, IF IT'S LIKE -- LIKE A MANAGEMENT COMPANY SIGN? I'M JUST TRYING TO THINK, IS IT WORSE TO HAVE THESE LIKE TEMPORARY FREE-STANDING SIGNS IN THE YARDS OF THESE HOUSES THAN IT IS TO HAVE THE LITTLE PHONE NUMBER ON --
01:03:54.707: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  SO WE ARE NOT REGULATING THE CONTENT OF THAT FREE-STANDING SIGN, AND THAT'S INTENTIONAL TO PROVIDE THE FLEXIBILITY. YES, IT MAY BE UTILIZED BY A PROPERTY OWNER TO SAY FOR LEASE. SIMILARLY, IT MIGHT BE USED BY A TENANT TO ADVOCATE A POSITION OR A POLITICAL IDEOLOGY OR ADVOCATE FOR A PLANET OR SOME OTHER MESSAGE. SO, YES, THEY COULD USE THAT FOR THAT PURPOSE. WE ARE NOT SPECIFYING THE CONTENT. WE ARE TRYING TO FIND THE BALANCE OF AN ADEQUACY OF FREE SPEECH AND PHYSICAL CONSTRAINT OF THE PROPERTY.
01:04:31.644: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT: YEAH, NO, I COMPLETELY GET IT. I JUST DON'T WANT TO SEE A BUNCH OF TEMPORARY FREE STANDING MANAGEMENT COMPANY SIGNS IN PEOPLE'S YARDS. BUT I GUESS I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO ABOUT THAT.
01:04:45.858: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT: THAT IS THE BALANCE THAT --
01:04:50.830: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  THAT IS THE BALANCE THAT I HOPE WE HAVE FOUND WITH THIS ORDINANCE, IS TRYING TO FIND AN ADEQUACY OF OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO INVOKE THEIR SPEECH IN A DEFINED FASHION BASED ON THESE GEOGRAPHIES.
01:05:07.146: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT: UH-HUH.
01:05:08.047: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  AND IT IS A BALANCE.
01:05:09.648: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT: SO IF WHENEVER THIS PASSES, RIGHT NOW, THE CURRENT ORDINANCE, AS IT STANDS IS LIKE BASICALLY UNCONSTITUTIONAL?
01:05:18.958: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  WELL, I WOULD NOT CLEARLY STATE THAT, BUT IT IS NOT CONTENT NEUTRAL. YOU WILL FIND LOTS OF REFERENCES TO SPECIFIC TYPES OF SIGNS AND SPECIFIC REGULATIONS TO THOSE.
01:05:32.004: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT: IS THE AMENDMENT PROCESS LIKE -- IF WE PASS THIS AS IS, AND IT PASSES AS IS, BUT STUFF IS FOUND, BECAUSE YOU MENTIONED THAT THE OLD ORDINANCE HAS BEEN AMENDED SEVERAL TIMES, IS THAT AMENDMENT PROCESS PAINFUL?
01:05:44.116: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  IT'S THE SAME PROCESS AS ADOPTION.
01:05:47.953: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT: OKAY.
01:05:49.088: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  AND ONE THING THAT WE ARE ALSO MAKING SURE TO INCLUDE IN THIS, WHILE WE DO HAVE A SEVERABILITY CLAUSE IN THE WHOLE UDC, WHICH IS SORT OF AN ATTORNEY TERM OF SAYING THAT IF ONE PROVISION OF THIS IS DEEMED TO BE ILLEGAL, IT DOESN'T INVALIDATE THE BALANCE OF OUR ORDINANCE, SO WE HAVE ADDED THAT PROVISION SPECIFICALLY TO THIS. I KNOW WE ARE IN 2019, BUT 2015 CASE LAW FROM THE SUPREME COURT IS ACTUALLY STILL RELATIVELY RECENT, AND OTHER CASE LAW COULD CONTINUE TO DEVELOP, BUT IN SHORT, IT WOULD BE THE SAME PROCESS. HOWEVER, I THINK GENERALLY IT WOULD BE EASIER, BECAUSE WE HAVE STARTED FROM THIS CONTENT-NEUTRAL STRUCTURE, WHERE I THINK THE CHANGES WOULD PROBABLY BE PERHAPS NUMERIC OR QUANTITATIVE AS OPPOSED TO SORT OF STARTING OVER LIKE WE ARE NOW.
01:06:42.875: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT: I FEEL LIKE AN IMPERFECT CONTENT-NEUTRAL ORDINANCE IS PROBABLY BETTER THAN WHAT WE HAVE.
01:06:48.180: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  WHEN I TALK ABOUT THIS, TO BE CLEAR, THIS WOULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF REPEALING THE ENTIRE SIGN SECTION OF OUR CURRENT CHAPTER OF THE UDC, SO I DIDN'T SHOW YOU THAT SORT OF ALL DELETED, BUT THIS WOULD REPLACE THAT PROVISION, AND THEN WE DID SHOW YOU THE SORT OF TRACK CHANGES VERSION OF THE OTHER SECTIONS OF THE UDC THAT WOULD BE IMPACTED.
01:07:12.037: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS: QUESTION.
01:07:13.706: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN: COMMISSIONER WOODS.
01:07:14.607: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS:  I JUST WANTED TO FOLLOW UP A LITTLE BIT MORE ON THE CROCKETTS AND SOME OF THEIR CONCERNS, AND SO I WANTED TO JUST MAKE SURE I'M UNDERSTANDING. SO, CURRENTLY, WITH THE ORDINANCE THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE, WHAT -- AND EITHER MR. CHANG OR MR. LENART COULD ANSWER THIS, PLEASE. WHAT IS CONSIDERED AN INFRACTION RIGHT NOW BASED UPON THE DESCRIPTION THAT THE CROCKETTS GAVE US, IN TERMS OF SEEING NUMEROUS SIGNS ON RENTAL PROPERTIES IN THE OLD FOURTH WARD?
01:07:52.044: >> IT'S A LITTLE DIFFICULT WITHOUT KNOWING. WE'D HAVE TO LOOK THROUGH THE ORDINANCE TO FIND OUT WHAT IS THE ZONING, WHAT'S THE SIZE OF THE SIGN, WHERE IS IT LOCATED. SO, AGAIN, WE TAKE THEM ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS.
01:08:05.791: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS:  OKAY. AND --
01:08:11.197: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  BUT --
01:08:11.830: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS:  GO AHEAD.
01:08:12.865: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  TO BE CLEAR, ONE EXAMPLE OF THAT THAT WAS BROUGHT UP IS IF YOU HAD EIGHT TEMPORARY SIGNS, THIS NEW CODE WOULD RESTRICT NO MORE THAN FOUR TEMPORARY SIGNS IN SOME OF THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES.
01:08:27.213: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS:  OKAY.
01:08:28.514: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  SO THAT WOULD BE ONE EXAMPLE OF HOW THAT CHANGE WOULD OCCUR. I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT THE SORT OF NONCONFORMING LIKELIHOOD OF MAINTENANCE OF A TEMPORARY SIGN VERSUS A PERMANENT SIGN IS PROBABLY ALSO DIFFERENT. SO THERE'S PROBABLY MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO GET THOSE KIND OF PROPERTIES INTO COMPLIANCE LONG TERM THAN PERHAPS A PROPERTY THAT HAS A PERMANENT FFIXED TO IT THAT'S NONCONFORMING.
01:08:56.609: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS:  OKAY. AND THOSE EIGHT SIGNS WOULD, IF THIS WERE TO PASS, THOSE WOULD BE CONTENT-NEUTRAL, WHICH MEANT THAT IT COULD BE EIGHT SIGNS FOR, I DON'T KNOW, VOTE FOR SO-AND-SO OR THINGS LIKE THAT, OR SEVEN VOTING AND MAYBE ONE THAT SAYS HOUSE FOR RENT?
01:09:15.628: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  AGAIN, WE'D BE RESTRICTING IT TO LIKELY NO MORE THAN FOUR FREE STANDING SIGNS.
01:09:20.866: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS:  FOUR, OKAY.
01:09:22.801: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  THEY COULD DO ONE OF POTENTIAL THEIR FULL SQUARE FOOTAGE ALLOTMENT, OR IT COULD BE DIVIDED AMONG FOUR FREE STANDING SIGNS. AND YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT, IT COULD BE SAVE THE WHALES, VOTE FOR MAYOR WOODS --
01:09:39.051: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS:  I LIKE THAT ONE.
01:09:41.186: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  AND CITY PLANNER LENART IS AN IDIOT.
01:09:45.858: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS:  I DON'T LIKE THAT ONE.
01:09:47.192: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  SO YOU ARE RIGHT, THEY ARE CONTENT NEUTRAL, THEY ARE BASED ON THE SIZE OF THE PROPERTY, AND LIMITS EXIST.
01:09:59.772: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS:  I WAS ALSO JOTTING SOME NOTES DOWN. IN TERMS OF A REMEDY, FOR THOSE WHO MIGHT BE NEIGHBORS TO SOME OF THESE PROPERTY OWNERS, THEIR REMEDY SEEMS TO BE THAT THEY SHOULD GET IN TOUCH WITH THE COMMUNITY SERVICES DIVISION. DO THEY CALL IT IN?
01:10:18.257: >> WELL, IF IT'S THE PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY, WE WOULD GO TO COMMUNITY STANDARDS, BUT ON PRIVATE PROPERTY, THEY COULD CALL PLANNING, OR, IN THIS CASE, ZONING, AND WE HAVE A GENTLEMAN THAT WOULD GO OUT AND DO ENFORCEMENT.
01:10:31.303: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS:  OKAY. AND -- HM. I DON'T NECESSARILY WANT TO SAY HOW SUCCESSFUL IS THAT, BUT I'M GETTING THE SENSE THAT THIS IS AN ONGOING ISSUE FOR SOME FOLKS WHO LIVE IN THE FOURTH WARD, BECAUSE THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME THAT WE HAVE HEARD IT, OR IF WE DRIVE THROUGH THAT AREA, YOU CAN SEE SOME OF THIS TOO, AND NOT JUST THROUGH THE FOURTH WARD BUT ALSO SOME OTHER PLACES IN TOWN. SO, AS A STAFF, ARE YOU FEELING FAIRLY CONFIDENT THAT THIS WOULD BE A GOOD REMEDY FOR THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS THAT ARE EXPERIENCING THIS KIND OF PHENOMENA?
01:11:10.909: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  THIS WILL NOT SOLVE ALL OF THOSE ISSUES, PARTICULARLY WITH TEMPORARY SIGNAGE. ENFORCEMENT I THINK WILL CONTINUE TO BE CHALLENGING. ONE THING THAT I THINK WILL HELP ADDRESS THE CONDITION IN A MORE POSITIVE WTHAT WE WILL BE STANDARDIZING WHAT THE REGULATIONS ARE IN A WAY. RIGHT NOW, OUR CURRENT ORDINANCE HAS DIFFERENT LIMITATIONS, DEPENDING ON THE SIZE OF SIGNAGE. I THINK -- I DON'T THINK THE SORT OF CONSOLIDATING EVERYTHING INTO THE SAME REQUIREMENTS IS AN AUTOMATIC SOLUTION. HOWEVER, I THINK IT WILL ADD A CONSISTENCY IN OUR ABILITY TO RESPOND, FRANKLY JUST MORE QUICKLY THAN MAYBE SPENDING THE TIME TO RESEARCH A PARTICULAR SIGN CONTENT.
01:12:00.325: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS:  OKAY. AND THIS MAY BE SOMETHING THAT WE'LL TALK ABOUT LATER ON, DEPENDING ON WHAT HAPPENS WITH IT HERE AND THEN ON CITY COUNCIL, BUT HOW DOES THE PUBLIC OR THE NEIGHBORHOODS FIND OUT ABOUT THESE CHANGES AND THEN BE ABLE TO REALIZE THAT IT'S NOW STANDARDIZED, WHICH, AS YOU SAID, SHOULD REALLY MAKE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO KNOW WHEN SOMEONE IS IN VIOLATION.
01:12:24.016: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  YEAH, THIS WAS A GOOD QUESTION. I THINK UNLIKE PROBABLY -- THIS MORE SO THAN OTHER UDC CHANGES MIGHT WARRANT SOME SORT OF COMMUNICATION EFFORT THAT WE COULD LOOK AT AS WE PROGRESS TO CITY COUNCIL AND TAL ABOUT HOW WE MIGHT -- ANY IDEAS WE HAVE TO ACHIEVE THAT.
01:12:39.798: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS:  THANK YOU.
01:12:44.369: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN: COMMISSIONER BRIGGS.
01:12:45.304: >> COMMISSIONER BRIGGS:  YEAH, SO I HAVE BEEN KIND OF PONDERING THE UNLIMITED TEMPORARY SIGN FOR A BIT, AND I FEEL A LITTLE BIT GUILTY, BECAUSE I -- THIS ISN'T A SUBSTANTIVE CHANGE. IT WAS IN THERE THE LAST DRAFT, AND OBVIOUSLY I DIDN'T -- IT WASN'T?
01:13:01.320: >> OH, NO, NO, IT'S STILL OKAY TO BRING IT UP. THAT'S FINE.
01:13:06.892: >> COMMISSIONER BRIGGS:  OKAY. SO BUT TO ME THIS JUST SUGGESTS -- THIS JUST CONTRIBUTES TO SIGN [ OFF MIC ] -- WE ARE PROVIDING FOLKS WITH FOUR TEMPORARY SIGNS THAT CAN BE PLACED FOR 65 CONTINUOUS DAYS. YES, THEY NEED TO TAKE THEM DOWN FOR 30 DAYS FOR A GAP, BUT WE ARE PROVIDING PRETTY AMPLE OPPORTUNITY FOR FREE SPEECH IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT MECHANISMS WITH FOUR TEMPORARY SIGNS, AND SO I'M INCLINED TO THINK THAT THERE IS REALLY NO REASON FOR US TO BE PROVIDING ONE UNLIMITED SIGN ON THESE PROPERTIES. WE ALREADY HAVE AN EXCEPTION IF THE BUILDING IS UP FOR -- OBVIOUSLY FOR SALE OR LEASE, AND THIS IS FREE-STANDING, WHICH ALSO MEANS IT'S MUCH MORE VISIBLE IN OUR LANDSCAPES, WHICH ARE ALREADY QUITE CLUTTERED SOMETIMES. SO, I DON'T KNOW, I WOULD BE INCLINED TO PUT FORWARD AN AMENDMENT TO STRIKE B FROM SECTION 2 IN THE TEMPORARY FREE STANDING SIGNS, BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY AGREEMENT AROUND THE TABLE BEFORE I PUT THAT FORWARD. AS OTHERS HAVE BEEN PONDERING THIS.
01:14:29.741: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  SO IF WE CAN GET BACK TO THAT IN A MINUTE, I HAVE A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT I WOULD LIKE TO BRING UP. MR. FROST, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. I HAVE A QUESTION THAT, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE BEEN SLOWLY MOVING THROUGH THE -- THROUGH THIS CHANGE AND OUR SIGN ORDINANCE. DOES OUR CURRENT SIGN ORDINANCE OPEN US UP TO LITIGATION, THE WAY IT'S SET FORTH RIGHT NOW? I WAS THINKING MR. FROST WOULD ANSWER THAT, SINCE HE'S HERE AND WE'D LIKE TO PUT HIM ON, ON STAGE.
01:15:06.511: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  HE MIGHT ASK ME TO ANSWER THAT.
01:15:08.880: >> YEAH, I'M NOT GOING TO COMMENT ON WHAT RISK THE CITY MIGHT HAVE IN PUBLIC SESSION, BUT IF YOU WOULD LIKE MORE INFORMATION ON THAT, I CAN PROVIDE SOME ADVICE SEPARATELY.
01:15:17.089: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  ALL RIGHT. WELL, THANK YOU. AT LEAST WE GOT YOU TO SPEAK ONCE. SO I APPRECIATE THAT. MR. LENART?
01:15:24.596: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  I WOULD JUST SAY THAT I BELIEVE THIS DRAFT DOES PUT US IN A MORE DEFENSIBLE POSITION, JUST AGAIN BASED ON THAT THE SUPREME COURT CASE EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF NEUTRALITY. YOU SHOULDN'T BE REQUIRED TO LOOK AT WHAT THE SIGN SAYS IN ORDER TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT IT. I THINK THIS ORDINANCE ACHIEVES THAT. I THINK THERE ARE CURRENT PROVISIONS OF OUR CURRENT CODE THAT DO REQUIRE YOU TO ASSESS THE CONTENT OF IT, THAT IT WOULD GIVE ME PAUSE, BUT I AM NOT AN ATTORNEY.
01:15:56.428: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  THANK YOU. WITH REGARDS TO THE ELIMINATION OF THE THREE SQUARE FOOT WALL SIGNS ON ONE AND TWO-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS, I'M A LITTLE -- I UNDERSTAND WHY YOU WOULD WANT TO REMOVE IT, BUT I GUESS THERE IS A CONCERN THAT I HAVE WITH REGARDS TO PROPERTIES THAT ARE RENTED IN THE ONE AND TWO-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS. WITH REGARDS TO, YOU KNOW, IT TAKES -- SOMETIMES WHEN YOU HAVE AN ISSUE WITH A PROPERTY AND IT HAS A SIGN ON IT, AND YOU HAVE A LANDLORD'S CONTACT INFORMATION OR A PROPERTY MANAGER'S CONTACT INFORMATION TO REACH OUT TO, IT COULD BE HELPFUL VERSUS THEN JUST CALLING THE CITY AND HAVING THE CITY DO THE ENFORCEMENT. I KNOW PROPERTY MANAGERS WHO ARE VERY RESPONSIVE ONCE THEY LEARN ABOUT ISSUES, AND I AM SURE MANY OF THEM WOULD LIKE TO LEARN FROM THE NEIGHBORS VERSUS FROM THE CITY WHEN THEY ARE BEING FINED OR WHEN OTHER ISSUES COME UP. SO I'M NOT EXACTLY ON BOARD FOR REMOVING THOSE SIGNS, AND THAT'S THE ONE SIGN THAT I'M THINKING OF RIGHT NOW, OF HAVING A PROPERTY MANAGER'S CONTACT INFORMATION ON A BUILDING SO THAT THE NEIGHBORS HAVE SOME CONTACT INFORMATION. WAS THERE A REASON FOR THE REMOVAL?
01:17:18.243: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  WE HAD A SIMILAR DISCUSSION. KEEP IN MIND THAT IF IT'S PROVIDED, THERE'S NO RESTRICTION ON CONTENT, SO IT COULD BE A PROPERTY OWNER CONTACT, OR IT COULD BE SOME OTHER MESSAGE. WE DID -- WE DISCUSSED IT. I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK FOR EVERYBODY, BUT MY RATIONALE FOR IT IS THAT THE CHARACTER OF THOSE USES MIGHT BE MORE PREVALENT IN R1 AND R2 DISTRICTS. THEY TEND TO BE MORE RESIDENTIAL IN NATURE. WHILE NOT -- WHILE SOME OF THEM VERY MUCH MAY BE RENTAL PROPERTIES, THE NUMBER OF RENTAL PROPERTIES IN THE HIGHER DENSITY AREAS ARE PROBABLY MORE PREVALENT, AND SO IT WAS A BALANCE OF JUST WHAT IS THE APPROPRIATE WAY TO ADDRESS CHARACTER WITH PERMANENT SIGNS, BUT I THINK -- I WOULD JUST -- TO LINK THOSE TWO COMMENTS, I THINK THAT IN BALANCING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR FREE SPEECH, THAT UNLIMITED TEMPORARY SIGN PROBABLY SHOULD BE CONSIDERED CAREFULLY IF REMOVED AS IT RELATES PARTICULARLY TO ONE AND TWO-FAMILY SIGNAGES THAT DON'T HAVE AS MANY OPPORTUNITIES FOR SPEECH.
01:18:42.093: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  OKAY. IS THERE ANY WAY TO -- I GUESS IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE I -- I THINK FOR A LOT OF NEIGHBORS AND FOR ME PERSONALLY, WHEN I SEE A FRIEND'S SIGN ATTACHED TO A BUILDING AND I SEE THAT THEIR LAWN IS UNCUT, I MAKE THE PHONE CALL TO THE LANDLORD OR TO MY FRIEND WHO HAS THAT PROPERTY LISTED OR IS MANAGING IT. ALSO, THIS ADDS A -- THERE'S UNCERTAINTY, JUST BECAUSE IF YOU GO INTO THE CITY RECORDS, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO FIND OUT WHO THE OWNER IS IF THE PROPERTY IS MANAGED BY A MANAGEMENT COMPANY. SO I GUESS JUST FROM THAT ANGLE OF KNOWING WHO THE LANDLORD IS OF THE PROPERTY, BUT I UNDERSTAND WHAT OTHER MESSAGE COULD GO UP THERE. MAYBE I'M NOT THINKING ABOUT THAT, AND MAYBE THAT'S -- MAYBE WE DON'T WANT THAT MESSAGE UP. SO DEPENDING ON HOW WE VOTE ON THIS THIS EVENING, IF WE TABLE IT, WE MIGHT WANT TO REVISIT THAT, POTENTIALLY. WITH REGARDS TO PERMITS, SO, I DID SEE THAT RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES DO NOT NEED A PERMIT FOR TEMPORARY SIGNS, BUT I DID NOT SEE FOR COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES THAT ARE FOR LEASE. SO THE EXCEPTION, NO PERMIT IS REQUIRED, IT SAYS TEMPORARY SIGNS IN RESIDENTIAL ZONING DISTRICTS, AND THEN THE TEMPORARY FREE-STANDING SIGNS PERMITTED UNDER SECTION 5 DOT ALL OF THAT IN ALL ZONING DISTRICTS. I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY, DOES THAT MEAN THERE ARE NO PERMITS REQUIRED FOR TEMPORARY SIGNS IN BOTH RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL DISTRICTS? IS THAT CORRECT?
01:20:34.906: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  I BELIEVE SO, BUT LET ME DOUBLE-CHECK. THE TEMPORARY -- ALL TEMPORARY SIGNS IN RESIDENTIAL ZONING DISTRICTS DO NOT REQUIRE A PERMIT, AND THE UNLIMITED SIGN IN ALL DISTRICTS DON'T REQUIRE A PERMIT. OTHER TEMPORARY SIGNS IN NONRESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS WOULD REQUIRE A PERMIT.
01:21:14.546: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  SO A COMMERCIAL BROKER MARKETING A PROPERTY FOR SALE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO GET A PERMIT FOR A TEMPORARY SIGN?
01:21:21.586: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  YES.
01:21:24.122: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE AN ISSUE THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT, JUST BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE IN TOWN AND LOTS OF SIGNS, AND CURRENTLY PERMITS ARE NOT REQUIRED.
01:21:38.636: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  AGAIN, THOUGH, WE CAN'T DISTINGUISH A FOR LEASE SIGN FROM OTHER TYPE OF SIGNAGE. SO WE COULD SAY THAT A POTENTIAL AMENDMENT WOULD BE TEMPORARY SIGNAGE IN NONRESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES DO NOT REQUIRE A PERMIT, SO THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED.
01:22:03.161: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  AND I THINK THAT'S THE DIRECTION THAT I WOULD LIKE TO GO IN. AND WE CAN DISCUSS THAT FURTHER. THEN IN REGARDS TO -- AND, SORRY, YOU KNOW, IN MY FIELD OF REAL ESTATE, OPEN HOUSE SIGNS, ARE THOSE CONSIDERED TEMPORARY SIGNS?
01:22:28.820: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  PROBABLY.
01:22:31.189: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  OKAY. SO WHETHER THEY ARE PUT UP FOR TWO HOURS OR UNTIL -- WELL, TECHNICALLY, OPEN HOUSE SIGNS DON'T GO IN FRONT OF A PROPERTY THAT IS FOR SALE, OTHER THAN ONE, BUT DIRECTIONAL SIGNS TO THE OPEN HOUSE.
01:22:49.340: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  THAT WOULD BE A TEMPORARY SIGN THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE WITHIN THE REQUIRED ALLOTMENT OF A RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY OR RUNNING AFOUL OF THAT AND COULD NOT BE PLACED IN THE PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY.
01:23:06.024: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  SO A PROPERTY THAT IS -- SO I'M AT THE CORNER OF GREEN AND PLYMOUTH, AND I'M OUTSIDE THE RIGHT-OF-WAY PUTTING A DIRECTIONAL SIGN ON A PROPERTY THAT I DON'T OWN. IS THAT AN ALLOWED USE? IS THAT AN ALLOWED TEMPORARY SIGN?
01:23:25.910: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  IT WOULD BE A FREE-STANDING SIGN, SO LONG AS THEY WERE NOT -- DIDN'T ALREADY HAVE THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OR SQUARE FEET. AND IT WOULD NOT REQUIRE A PERMIT, BECAUSE IT'S LIKELY IN A RESIDENTIAL AREA. IF IT WERE IN A COMMERCIAL AREA AND THAT WAS -- CURRENTLY WE WOULD REQUIRE A PERMIT FOR A TEMPORARY SIGN.
01:23:50.468: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  OKAY. SO, CORNER OF PLYMOUTH AND GREEN IS A COMMERCIAL PROPERTY, SO IN ORDER FOR ME TO PUT A DIRECTIONAL OPEN HOUSE SIGN FOR TWO HOURS WOULD REQUIRE ME TO GET A PERMIT FROM THE CITY?
01:24:04.082: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  YES. TECHNICALLY, WE CAN'T REGULATE A SIGN FOR A SPECIFIC DURATION DIFFERENTLY. I DOUBT -- I BET THAT HAPPENS.
01:24:16.194: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  AND HOW -- IN THE CURRENT CODE, HOW DOES THAT -- SO I DID SEE THERE WAS A PROVISION FOR OPEN HOUSE SIGNS IN THE CURRENT CODE.
01:24:26.771: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  THAT IS UNFORTUNATELY CONTENT-SPECIFIC, AND THE U.S. SUPREME COURT HAS SAID SHAME ON SUCH LANGUAGE.
01:24:32.577: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  OKAY. SO, THAT'S ANOTHER ONE. AND THEN WINDOW SIGNS, IF WE CAN GO BACK TO RESIDENTIAL WINDOW SIGNS. SO IN CONDOMINIUM COMPLEXES, SOME CONDOMINIUM COMPLEXES ALLOW FOR PROPERTY OWNERS TO PUT A FOR SALE SIGN INTO A WINDOW THAT'S A TEMPORARY SIGN. WOULD THAT BE CONSIDERED A TEMPORARY SIGN?
01:25:06.578: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  IS IT AFFIXED TO THE WINDOW?
01:25:10.014: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  IT IS NOT AFFIXED. WELL, IT MIGHT BE TAPED TO THE WINDOW.
01:25:16.754: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  OH, YOU'RE KILLING ME.
01:25:20.425: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  [ LAUGHTER ].
01:25:23.795: >> LEANING AGAINST THE WINDOW? [ LAUGHTER ].
01:25:28.866: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  GENERALLY, WE DON'T REGULATE WINDOWS THROUGH OUR SIGN ORDINANCE NOW OR AS PROPOSED. WE DO PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL FREE-STANDING SIGN. THAT WOULD BE MULTIPLE FAMILY, WHICH YOU WOULD BE ALLOWED A TEMPORARY WALL SIGN UP TO 12 SQUARE FEET. I THINK THE ORDINANCE IS SILENT ON IT, SO I THINK TECHNICALLY IT WOULD PROBABLY BE ILLEGAL.
01:26:08.573: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  AND THAT'S A PROBLEM.
01:26:12.310: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  WELL, THEN, SO YOU -- SO YOUR GOAL WOULD BE TO PROVIDE A SPECIFIC ALLOCATION OF RESIDENTIAL WINDOW SIGNAGE.
01:26:25.923: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  TEMPORARY SIGNAGE.
01:26:27.458: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  I WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT CREATING -- SO RIGHT NOW WE HAVE TWO TYPES OF TEMPORARY SIGNS, FREE STANDING AND WALL. WE COULD LOOK AT -- I THINK WE COULD LOOK AT HOW WE WOULD ACCOMMODATE SOME USE IN THAT REGARD.
01:26:48.846: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  OKAY.
01:26:49.414: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW THAT IS.
01:26:50.581: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  OKAY. AND I PROMISE THIS IS MY LAST ONE, AND I'M SORRY. ALLEYS, SO WE HAVE SEEN A LITTLE BIT OF -- ACTUALLY, NOT IN ANN ARBOR QUITE YET, BUT I RECENTLY VISITED A BUSINESS THAT'S OFF OF AN ALLEY HERE IN TOWN THAT DOES HAVE SIGNAGE ON THERE, AND WE ARE STARTING TO SEE IN A LOT OF CITIES THAT HAVE HAD REALLY EXPENSIVE REAL ESTATE, WHERE ALLEYS ARE BEING REVITALIZED. DETROIT IS ONE OF THE PLACES THAT WE ARE SEEING THAT. AND I NOTICED THAT THERE'S NO MORE -- ALLEYS ARE NOW LOOKED UPON AS THE BUILDING AS A WHOLE FOR SIGNAGE. WAS THERE A REASON FOR GETTING AWAY FROM ALLEY SIGNAGE AND SEPARATING IT OUT OR NO LONGER SEPARATING IT OUT?
01:27:46.537: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  YES. WE DETERMINED THAT ALLEY SIGNS WOULD BE EITHER WALL SIGNS, PROJECTING SIGNS, OR COULD BE POTENTIALLY A CANOPY SIGN. IT DIDN'T NEED TO BE DEFINED SPECIFICALLY. THEY ARE STILL PERMITTED WITHIN THOSE CATEGORIES. YOU WOULD HAVE TO CHOOSE TO ALLOCATE YOUR SQUARE FOOTAGE TO THAT SPACE. YOUR SQUARE FOOTAGE IS STILL BASED ON THE BUILDING FRONTAGE, BUT WE DETERMINED THAT IT WASN'T NECESSARY TO DEFINE IT UNTO ITSELF, BECAUSE IN ALLEYS COULD PROBABLY MORE APPROPRIATELY MEET ONE OF THE FORMS OF THE TYPES OF SIGNS WE HAVE DEFINED.
01:28:21.773: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  THANK YOU. AND JUST AS A FINAL THOUGHT WITH AN ITEM JUST BROUGHT UP BY COMMISSIONER BRIGGS AND SOME OF THE THINGS I HAVE BROUGHT UP, I THINK IT MIGHT BE WORTHWHILE FOR US TO TABLE THIS FOR A LITTLE WHILE, JUST TO LOOK AT SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP. -- AND GET ADDITIONAL COMMUNITY FEEDBACK ON THIS BEFORE MOVING FORWARD. BUT I WILL, OF COURSE, SEND THIS OFF TO THE COMMISSION TO DISCUSS. COMMISSIONER BRIGGS?
01:28:52.703: >> COMMISSIONER BRIGGS:  YES. I AM NOT SURE IF I WAS JUST NOT FOLLOWING THE QUESTION PROPERLY OR THE ANSWERS PROPERLY, BUT I'M TRYING TO MAKE SURE I'M UNDERSTANDING THE TEMPORARY FREE-STANDING SIGNS AND YOUR DISTINCTION BETWEEN RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL USE, BECAUSE WHAT I'M SEEING IS THAT THERE IS AN EXCEPTION, IF THE BUILDING OR LOT IS FOR SALE OR LEASE, AND THAT THERE ARE TEMPORARY SIGNS THAT ARE PERMITTED IN BOTH RESIDENTIAL MULTIFAMILY AND NONRESIDENTIAL. SO I'M NOT UNDERSTANDING WHERE A PERMIT IS REQUIRED FOR A NONRESIDENTIAL TEMPORARY REAL ESTATE SIGN. WHERE IS THAT?
01:29:33.845: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  BECAUSE WE REQUIRE PERMITS FOR ALL SIGNS, EXCEPT FOR THOSE LISTED IN SECTION 5.29.2. THAT THERE SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSES RESIDENTIAL SIGNS IN COMMERCIAL ZONING DISTRICTS AND THE FREE STANDING SIGN UNDER THE TEMPORARY FREE STANDING SIGN, THAT COULD BE AMENDED TO REFERENCE THAT SECTION MORE GENERALLY TO PROVIDE EITHER EXCEPTION FROM THE ADDITIONAL SIGNAGE THAT YOU GET FROM BUILDING LOT FOR SALE OR UNLIMITED SIGN. AGAIN, KEEP IN MIND THOUGH THAT THAT SUB A IS NOT A FOR LEASE SIGN. YOU GET ADDITIONAL FREE TEMPORARY STANDING SIGN FOR YOUR PROPERTY WHEN IT IS SALE OR FOR LEASE FOR THAT DURATION. IT DOES NOT REQUIRE YOU TO USE IT FOR THAT PURPOSE. WE ARE CONTENT NEUTRAL ON WHAT YOU PUT ON THAT SIGN.
01:30:37.174: >> THAT'S ADDITIONAL TO WHAT'S LISTED IN THIS TABLE?
01:30:40.144: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  CORRECT.
01:31:04.602: >> COMMISSIONER BRIGGS:  OKAY. I DON'T KNOW IF I'M BEING OBTUSE ON THIS. I JUST DON'T KNOW WHY THE NONRESIDENTIAL ISN'T INCLUDED. WHAT EXACTLY WOULD NEED TO BE CHANGED TO -- IN THIS SECTION?
01:31:17.281: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  SO TO --
01:31:18.983: >> COMMISSIONER BRIGGS:  TO ADJUST FOR --
01:31:22.486: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  SO THAT NO TEMPORARY FREE STANDING SIGNS WOULD REQUIRE A PERMIT?
01:31:31.662: >> COMMISSIONER BRIGGS:  RIGHT.
01:31:32.296: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  SO THE ADJUSTMENT WOULD BE IN 5.29.2, AND MY INITIAL THOUGHT, IT WOULD READ SOMETHING THAT NO PERMIT IS REQUIRED FOR SUB 3 TEMPORARY SIGNS PERMITTED UNDER THE TEMPORARY SIGNS SECTION. UNDER THAT CIRCUMSTANCE, IT WOULD EXEMPT TEMPORARY WALL SIGNS, FREE STANDING SIGNS, THE EXCEPTED EXCEPTION SIGNS FROM THE AREA AND DURATION LIMITATIONS.
01:32:16.707: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN: COMMISSIONER MILLS?
01:32:17.608: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  SO, BASED ON WHAT YOU JUST SAID, NOW I UNDERSTAND THE PERMIT SIDE, BUT ON THE EXCEPTIONS FOR THE TEMPORARY FREE STANDING SIGNS, I READ THAT AS EXCEPTIONS FROM THE TIME HOW LONG -- FROM THE DURATION, NOT THE AMOUNT OF SIGNAGE THAT YOU'RE ALLOWED. BECAUSE I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS A LIMITATION ON THE AMOUNT OF FOR SALE, FOR LEASE SIGNAGE THAT'S ALLOWED. AND I UNDERSTAND WHY WE WOULD WANT TO EXEMPT HOW LONG, IF IT TAKES MORE THAN 65 DAYS TO SELL A PR. I THINK THAT MAKES SENSE, BUT I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE LIMITATIONS ON THE AMOUNT OF SIGNAGE.
01:33:10.061: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  I THINK YOU'RE CORRECT. I MISSPOKE. THE EXCEPTION IN A PROVIDES YOU AN EXCEPTION FROM THE DURATION OF 65 DAYS WITH A 30-DAY GAP, SO LONG AS THAT BUILDING OR LOT IS FOR SALE. IT DOESN'T GIVE YOU INCREASED -- MY APOLOGIES.
01:33:34.552: >> GOOD. I THINK IT'S REALLY HELPFUL JUST TO MAKE SURE, AND SINCE WE ARE ON THIS SECTION, I HAVE -- I AGREE WITH WHAT COMMISSIONER BRIGGS SAID ABOUT CONSIDERING THIS LIKE PERMANENT TEMPORARY SIGNAGE, LIKE UNLIMITED TIME FOR A TEMPORARY SIGN. THE OTHER -- THE QUESTION THAT I HAVE THAT ACTUALLY MAYBE YOU CAN HELP US ANSWER -- I FORGOT YOUR NAME. SORRY -- IS THAT IT STIPULATES THAT IT HAS TO BE A NONCOMMERCIAL MESSAGE. WHICH IS INTERESTING TO ME, GIVEN THAT WE ARE MOVING AWAY -- LIKE MOVING TOWARDS CONTENT NEUTRALITY, SO HOW DOES THAT WORK? DID THAT SLIP THROUGH THE CRACKS? OR WAS THAT INTENTIONAL?
01:34:20.631: >> YEAH, WITHOUT GETTING INTO THE SPECIFIC PROVISION, THE COURTS HAVE LEFT OPEN THE POSSIBILITY TO REGULATE COMMERCIAL SIGNAGE DIFFERENTLY. HISTORICALLY, COMMERCIAL SIGNAGE HAS BEEN HELD TO A LESSER STANDARD THAN NONCOMMERCIAL SPEECH. SO...
01:34:39.316: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  OKAY. SO IF IT IS A -- THE WAY THAT I'M READING THESE, NOW WITH THESE TWO EXCEPTIONS NEXT TO EACH OTHER, IF A BUILDING OWNER IS OFFERING A BUILDING FOR LEASE, THE FIRST EXCEPTION THERE IT FALLS WITHIN THERE, THAT THEY CAN -- THAT IF IT TAKES THEM THREE MONTHS TO LEASE OUT OR SELL TBUILDING, THEY CAN HAVE THAT TEMPORARY SIGN UP FOR THREE MONTHS, AND, ACTUALLY, THAT DOESN'T SAY WHETHER IT NEEDS TO BE FREE STANDING OR IT CAN BE ON A WALL. IS THAT CORRECT?
01:35:14.585: >> YEAH, NO, WHATEVER TEMPORARY SIGNAGE IS ALLOWED IN THAT DISTRICT.
01:35:18.856: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  THEN YOU CAN HAVE IT FREE STANDING OR ON A WALL?
01:35:22.026: >> YEAH.
01:35:22.593: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  BUT IN THE CASE OF WHAT COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN WAS SAYING ABOUT WANTING TO HAVE THE PHONE NUMBER FOR WHOEVER IS MANAGING THE PROPERTY, WHO ALSO SENDS THE MESSAGE, LIKE, WHO YOU CALL IF YOU WANT TO LEASE THE PROPERTY, RIGHT, IT'S A YEAR-ROUND ADVERTISEMENT. IS THAT A GRAY AREA BETWEEN WHAT IS COMMERCIAL AND -- I MEAN, IN MY MIND, IT'S SORT OF COMMERCIAL, RIGHT? BUT IT COULD ALSO SERVE A PUBLIC SAFETY OR LIKE A COMMUNITY STANDARDS. SO I WAS READING THIS AS THE OPPORTUNITY -- THAT UNLIMITED SIGN, THE UNLIMITED TEMPORARY SIGN AS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE MANAGEMENT COMPANY TO PUT THEIR THREE-SQUARE FOOT SIGN UP, BUT IF IT SERVES THE PURPOSE OF LIKE ADVERTISING HOW YOU CAN LEASE THAT PROPERTY, THAT'S COMMERCIAL TO ME, ISN'T IT?
01:36:13.510: >> THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER IT'S COMMERCIAL OR NOT WOULD HAVE TO BE MADE ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS BY THE CODE ENFORCEMENT STAFF.
01:36:21.418: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  GOT IT. AND I THINK IT GOES WITH THAT, NOT KNOWING HOW THAT'S GOING TO -- UNLESS STAFF KNOWS HOW THAT'S GOING TO PAN OUT, BECAUSE WE CAN LOOK AT SOME EXISTING -- SOME EXISTING SUCH SIGNS, RIGHT? I THINK THAT THIS IDEA OF BEING ABLE TO HAVE SIGNS THAT ROTATE, EVEN IF IT'S THE SAME EFFECTIVE MESSAGE, BUT THAT THAT TEMPORARY SIGN CAN ONLY BE THERE FOR TWO MONTHS AT A TIME, TO KEEP IT IN GOOD REPAIR, IN MY MIND, SEEMS TO MAKE A WHOLE LOT MORE SENSE THAN TO ALLOW A FREE-STANDING SIGN, WHICH WE KNOW HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET RATTY, RIGHT, TO BE THERE FOREVER AT AN UNLIMITED BASIS. SO, AND IT RESOLVES THIS WHOLE LIKE WHAT IS COMMERCIAL AND WHAT IS NONCOMMERCIAL BUSINESS IN MY MIND. THAT'S MY TWO CENTS WORTH ON THAT, BUT I THINK THAT THERE'S ENOUGH QUESTIONS IN HERE. I THINK WHAT COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN SAID ABOUT WHEN WE REQUIRE PERMITS, REQUIRING PERMITS FOR REAL ESTATE SIGNS, OR ANY TEMPORARY SIGN FOR THAT MATTER I THINK DOESN'T -- I'M GLAD THAT YOU FOUND THAT -- LIKE THAT SEEMS SUPER ONEROUS IN MY MIND.
01:37:49.606: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN: COMMISSIONER SAUVE?
01:37:50.507: >> COMMISSIONER SAUVE:  SO, JUST ON THE PERMANENT TEMPORARY SIGN, WOULD YOU HAVE A CLAUSE THOUGH THAT DOES SAY THAT IT HAS TO BE PLACED IN GOOD REPAIR AS LONG AS IT'S ON DISPLAY? SO THAT WOULD COME DOWN TO ENFORCEMENT, WHICH ACTUALLY GETS BACK TO THE QUESTION OF FINES AND ENFORCEMENT. LIKE, FINES ARE NOT IN THIS. HOW ARE THOSE UPDATED OR, YOU KNOW, MODIFIED AND LIKE WHAT -- IF ENFORCEMENT ISN'T ACTIVE ENOUGH TO DETER THIS, THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO JUST PUT THE SIGNS BACK UP AGAIN, WHAT IS THE PROCESS OF INCREASING FINES OR OTHER FORMS OF ENFORCEMENT?
01:38:33.417: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  I BELIEVE THE FINES ARE IN HERE.
01:38:40.391: >> ARE THEY?
01:38:41.492: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  YEAH, IT'S $500, SECTION 5, $500 PLUS AND EACH DAY THAT A VIOLATION CONTINUES SHALL BE DEEMED A SEPARATE VIOLATION.
01:38:53.404: >> SO $500 A DAY. HOW OFTEN DO WE FINE?
01:39:00.477: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  WE HAVE HAD -- I DON'T KNOW SPECIFICALLY. I CAN TELL YOU OUR FIRST APPROACH IS TO TRY TO GET THE PROPERTY UNDER COMPLIANCE. OUR TYPICAL PROCESS IS WHEN A VIOLATION IS FOUND, WE WILL IDEALLY REACH OUT AND SEEK VOLUNTARY COMPLIANCE. THAT'S SORT OF THE MOST EFFICIENT USE OF EVERYBODY'S RESOURCES TO ACCOMPLISH THE GOAL OF THE ORDINANCE. IN THE EVENT THAT THAT DOESN'T DO, WE TYPICALLY PROVIDE A NOTICE OF VIOLATION, WHICH IS A LETTER THAT WE ARE GOING TO COMMUNICATE TO THE PROPERTY OWNER THAT YOU ARE IN VIOLATION OF THIS SPECIFIC PROVISION. WE'LL PROVIDE SOME TIME PERIOD FOR CORRECTION. THAT OFTEN THEN ACHIEVES A LOT MORE COMPLIANCE BEYOND THE VOLUNTARY, AND THEN I DON'T HAVE THE EXACT NUMBERS, BUT THEN THE NEXT STEP WOULD BE TO ISSUE A TICKET. SOMETIMES THAT TICKET ISSUANCE CAN RESULT IN COMPLIANCE AT THAT POINT. TIMES WE END UP IN COURT AND ONCE WE ARE IN COURT, WE ARE PRESENTING OUR CASE THAT WE BELIEVE IT'S A VIOLATION. THEY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISPUTE THAT, AND AT THAT POINT IT'S KIND OF IN THE COURT'S HANDS AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S GOING TO BE UPHELD OR NOT. IN THE EVENT THAT IT IS, THAT GIVES US A LOT MORE LATITUDE THEN TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE IS REACHED OR MORE CONFIDENCE TO START ISSUING MORE FREQUENT TICKETS AFTER THAT POINT. WE ARE NOT TYPICALLY IN THE PROCESS OF ISSUING TICKETS AFTER THAT NOTICE OF VIOLATION ON A DAILY BASIS. WE CONSIDER ALL OF THOSE TO BE DELIBERATE REASONABLE STEPS TO TRY TO BRING THE PROPERTY INTO COMPLIANCE.
01:40:45.215: >> COMMISSIONER SAUVE:  IS THE FINDING RETROACTIVE TO THE DATE OF A NOTICE, OR IS IT --
01:40:49.853: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  NO. EACH TICKET WOULD HAVE TO BE ISSUED ON A DAILY BASIS IN ORDER TO INVOKE THAT.
01:40:54.525: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN: COMMISSIONER SAUVE, IT READS NOT MORE THAN $500, NOT LESS THAN $100.
01:41:00.030: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  IT'S USUALLY $500.
01:41:01.465: >> COMMISSIONER SAUVE:  BUT THAT'S A DAILY LIMIT, SO IT COULD BE $500 A DAY. IT DOESN'T GO A HUNDRED DOLLARS A DAY UP TO FIVE DAYS, AND THEN THEY ARE CAPPED OUT SORT OF THING? IT'S INTERESTING TO HEAR, IT'S EVEN FOR THINGS LIKE FOR THE FOR SALE AND LEASE, IF SOMETHING IS GOING UP FOR LEASE FALL 2020 RIGHT NOW, THAT'S ALLOWED TO BE UP FOR A YEAR, RIGHT? WHICH GOES TO, YOU KNOW, THE PUBLIC COMMENTS ABOUT IT, BUT REGULATING THAT CONTENT VERSUS SOMETHING ELSE, WE ARE TRYING TO BE FLEXIBLE ENOUGH WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT REAL ESTATE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY WITHIN THESE RESIDENTIAL TEMPORARY SIGNS, BUT AGAIN, FINDING THAT BALANCE, IT'S A HARD ONE. I AM TRYING TO POKE HOLES AND PLAY SCENARIOS, BUT I ALSO BELIEVE THAT WE ARE PROBABLY PLANNING FOR A LOT OF THE WORST-CASE SCENARIOS, THAT THERE IS ENFORCEMENT IN PLACE IN A WAY, AND THAT I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY VIOLATIONS ARE GOING TO COME FROM OPEN HOUSE OR GARAGE SALE SIGNS, AND IF THEY DO START TO COME, THEN IT'S AN AMENDMENT, IS AN OPTION TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MANAGE THAT CONTENT. BUT, OKAY, THANKS.
01:42:24.181: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  AND JUST A CLARIFICATION ON THE FOR LEASE SIGNS FOR FALL OF 2020, THIS IS THE SEASON WHEN YOU SEE A LOT OF THOSE SIGNS. RENTAL SEASON BEGINS NOVEMBER 1ST AND RUNS THROUGH PRETTY MUCH UNTIL AUGUST 2020, SO IT'S NOT UNCOMMON TO SEE SIGNS, ALTHOUGH THERE ARE A LOT OF THEM OUT THERE RIGHT NOW. FURTHER DISCUSSION? COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT.
01:42:50.841: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT: I'M GETTING REALLY NITPICKING TOO WITH THESE TEMPORARY FREE STANDING SIGNS, BUT I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE. SO, IN THE EXCEPTION, WHEN THE BUILDING IS FOR SALE, IT SAYS THE MAXIMUM DISPLAY PERIOD, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, FOR TEMPORARY SIGNS ON THAT BUILDING OR LOT SHOULD BE -- SO THE "TEMPORARY SIGNS," SO YOU SAID YOU COULD HAVE UP TO FOUR TEMPORARY SIGNS, RIGHT?
01:43:11.328: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  IN RESIDENTIAL.
01:43:14.898: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT: IN RESIDENTIAL.
01:43:15.966: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  OR TEMPORARY SIGNS IN NONRESIDENTIAL? WHICH ARE YOU ASKING ABOUT?
01:43:20.871: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT: WELL THE EXCEPTIONS FOR TEMPORARY FREE STANDING SIGNS. I GUESS I AM NOT SURE IF THIS READS AS, IF YOU HAVE A HOME FOR LEASE IN FALL OF 2020, CAN YOU HAVE YOUR THREE OTHER TEMPORARY SIGNS? THE FACT THAT IT SAYS LIKE TEMPORARY SIGNS MAKES ME CONCERNED THAT, SINCE WE ARE NOT REGULATING CONTENT, IF YOU HAVE A HOME FOR LEASE, IN A YEAR FROM NOW, COULD YOU HAVE THREE OTHER SIGNS THAT JUST SAY WHATEVER, AND THOSE ARE NOT REGULATED, AND THEY CAN JUST BE UP UNTIL IT'S LEASED? RIGHT. BUT WE CAN'T REGULATE CONTENT, SO I DON'T KNOW HOW TO...
01:44:00.444: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  YES.
01:44:02.412: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  YES, WE ARE PROVIDING AN EXCEPTION OF TIMING FOR THE TEMPORARY SIGNS DURING THAT PERIOD THAT IT'S FOR SALE OR LEASE.
01:44:14.458: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT: THE TEMPORARY SIGNS COULD SAY ANYTHING, IF THE --
01:44:16.693: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  CORRECT, CORRECT.
01:44:19.696: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT: OKAY. AND THE PLACES ARE FOR LEASE, PRETTY MUCH ALWAYS.
01:44:24.601: >> NOVEMBER 1ST IS LIKE A FORMAL DATE OF LEASING.
01:44:28.672: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  DUE TO THE CITY ORDINANCE, THAT REQUIRES THE LANDLORDS NOT TO START SIGNING LEASES UNTIL 60 DAYS AFTER THE BEGINNING OF THE LEASE.
01:44:40.283: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT: I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW THAT ANYBODY IS GOING TO READ THE SIGN ORDINANCE THAT CLOSELY, LIKE ALL OF THESE LANDLORDS ARE ARE GOING TO BE LIKE, COOL, I CAN HAVE FOUR TEMPORARY SIGNS AT ANY HOUSE ALWAYS, BUT IT GETS BACK TO THE LIGHT POLLUTION AND CLUTTER ISSUE THAT RESIDENTS IN S WOULD BE, AS I WOULD BE.
01:45:07.144: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  THERE ARE SIGNS OUT THERE RIGHT NOW THAT SAY FREE HEAT, FREE WI-FI. SO IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY SAY FOR LEASE.
01:45:14.451: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT: RIGHT.
01:45:15.318: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  IT JUST HAS OTHER MESSAGES ON THEM.
01:45:19.523: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT: AND YOU COULD HAVE UP TO FOUR, IF THE PROPERTY IS TECHNICALLY FOR LEASE.
01:45:26.363: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  IT IS -- I WOULD WANT TO -- I JUST WANT TO -- WE COULD LOOK AT, IF THERE WAS CONCERN ABOUT THAT, IS EXTENDING THE PROHIBITION ON PERMANENT SIGNS FURTHER UP ON THE NUMBER OF UNITS. -- THAT WOULD DECREASE, YOU WOULD STILL LIKELY HAVE THE SAME TEMPORARY SIGNAGE PERMISSIONS, BUT YOU WOULD HAVE LESS SIGNAGE ON THE PROPERTY THROUGH A COMBINATION OF PERMANENT AND TEMPORARY SIGNAGE.
01:46:07.604: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT: WELL, COULD YOU ALSO JUST SAY THAT YOU'RE LIMITED TO ONE SIGN THAT'S LONGER THAN 65 DAYS, BUT ANY OTHER TEMPORARY SIGNS ARE STILL SUBJECT TO -- I MEAN, YOU'RE NOT REGULATING THE CONTENT OF THAT SIGN, BUT YOU'RE JUST ALLOWING THEM ONE THAT'S SORT OF UNTIL...
01:46:24.521: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  AND WE WOULD HAVE TO JUST PRESUME WHICH ONE THEY ARE DESIGNATING.
01:46:31.828: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT: IT IS THEIR CHOICE.
01:46:32.963: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  WHEN NO PERMITS ARE REQUIRED.
01:46:34.798: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT: RIGHT.
01:46:36.700: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  THAT MIGHT BE CHALLENGING.
01:46:37.868: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  SO I THINK WE HAVE ENOUGH FEEDBACK AT THIS POINT, OR I THINK MR. LENART, YOU HAVE ENOUGH FEEDBACK AT THIS POINT.
01:46:44.608: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  WELL, I -- I GUESS I WOULD APPRECIATE A LITTLE BIT MORE DIRECTION. SO, SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT CAME UP THAT I DON'T HAVE A CLEAR CONSENSUS IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE CHANGED OR WHAT WE CAN PROVIDE. I WANT TO BE -- I'M HEARING SOME CONSENSUS ON ELIMINATING THE REQUIREMENTS FOR PERMITS FOR ANY TEMPORARY SIGNS. I THINK WE CAN EXPLORE THAT. I'M HEARING -- I HEARD ONE, POSSIBLY TWO VOICES FOR REGULATING RESIDENTIAL WINDOW SIGNAGE.
01:47:31.321: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  SO THAT WE ARE NOT PROHIBITING --
01:47:34.891: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  RIGHT NOW, WE ARE SORT OF QUIET ON IT.
01:47:37.360: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  AND BEING QUIET ON IT --
01:47:39.996: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  SO YOU WOULD LIKE TO ALLOW RESIDENTIAL WINDOW SIGNAGE THROUGHOUT THE CITY?
01:47:44.434: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  I WOULD LIKE THAT TO COUNT TOWARDS THE SIGNS THAT YOU'RE ALLOWED. SO WHETHER IT'S -- IN MY MIND, WHETHER IT'S WINDOW OR WALL, IT'S A BUILDING SIGN.
01:47:53.276: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  THAT WOULD BE A TEMPORARY SIGN? BECAUSE THEN, FOR EXAMPLE, ON SINGLE AND TWO-FAMILY, WE DON'T PROVIDE ANY PERMANENT SIGNAGE CURRENTLY, ALTHOUGH THAT'S ANOTHER QUESTION.
01:48:04.087: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  IN MY MIND, PUTTING IT IN A WINDOW HAS THE SAME EFFECT AS PUTTING IT ON A WALL, IN MY MIND.
01:48:13.330: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  OKAY.
01:48:15.565: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  I WOULD AGREE.
01:48:16.600: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  THE PERMANENCY OF IT I THINK IS A SEPARATE MATTER, PERMANENT WINDOW SIGN OR PERMANENT WALL SIGN OR TEMPORARY. I DON'T WANT IT ADD ADDITIONAL SIGNAGE, BUT I THINK THE FLEXIBILITY OF PUTTING IT IN A WINDOW, OR PUTTING IT IN A WINDOW RATHER THAN PUTTING IT ON THE WALL, IS HELPFUL.
01:48:30.814: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  SO IN A MIXED-USE BUILDING -- WELL, LET ME THINK. IN A MIXED USE BUILDING WHERE YOU HAVE RETAIL AND RESIDENTIAL ABOVE, WE ONLY PROVIDE SIGNAGE CALCULATION TO THE GROUND FLOOR, SO IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE, ANY WINDOW SIGNAGE WOULD HAVE TO BE LIMITED TO A TEMPORARY STATUS, OR WE WOULD HAVE TO PROVIDE MORE SIGNAGE ALLOWED ON THAT BUILDING.
01:49:04.681: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  COULD THE SIGNAGE ON THE SECOND FLOOR BE COUNTED TOWARDS THE MAXIMUM THAT'S ALLOWED?
01:49:13.289: >> PLANNING MANAGER: POTENTIALLY, UNLESS THE FIRST FLOOR HAS ALREADY USED UP ALL OF THE SIGNAGE ALLOCATION, IN WHICH CASE THERE IS NONE AVAILABLE.
01:49:20.397: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  I WOULD BE FINE WITH THAT, IF THEY HAVE USED UP THE MAXIMUM.
01:49:25.568: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  IF THE BUSINESS FRONTAGE HAS USED THE MAXIMUM AVAILABLE FOR THE BUILDING, NONE IS AVAILABLE FOR THE UPPER FLOORS.
01:49:34.611: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  OR THEY WOULD HAVE TO RENEGOTIATE SHRINKING THE SIGNAGE DOWN ON THE FIRST FLOOR.
01:49:40.383: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  AS WRITTEN, HOW IS THAT SITUATION HANDLED? CAN PEOPLE UPSTAIRS PUT WINDOW SIGNS IN? BECAUSE IF YOU JUST SAID THAT SILENCE MEANS --
01:49:50.927: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  NOT ALLOWED.
01:49:51.995: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  NOT ALLOWED, THEN IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE THE STATUS QUO, LEAVING IT AS IS --
01:49:56.332: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  YOU COULD NOT DO THAT.
01:49:58.868: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  MEANING PEOPLE UPSTAIRS COULDN'T PUT ANYTHING IN THEIR WINDOWS?
01:50:02.972: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  CORRECT.
01:50:03.640: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  SO, IN MY MIND, HAVING COLLECTIVELY, RIGHT, NOT EXCEED THE THRESHOLD THAT WE PUT IS A BETTER SITUATION THAN WHAT WE ARE CURRENTLY IN. IT GIVES THE UPSTAIRS SOME FLEXIBILITY THEN.
01:50:13.249: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  YEAH, I THINK WE ARE DIVING TOO DEEP. THE INTENTION AND FEEDBACK I'M HEARING IS YOU WANT TO PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR RESIDENTIAL WINDOW SIGNAGE.
01:50:21.958: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  YES.
01:50:23.993: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  OKAY.
01:50:25.762: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  NOT ADDING TO SIGN BLIGHT BUT REPLACING INSTEAD OF WALL.
01:50:29.299: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  AND THAT WILL -- OKAY.
01:50:34.070: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  MAYBE COMMISSIONER SAUVE DISAGREES.
01:50:38.108: >> COMMISSIONER SAUVE:  DAYLIGHT VERSUS COVERING THE ARCHITECTURE. I DON'T KNOW. SO, PART OF MY TAKE, IT FEELS TEMPORARY, LIKE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT WHAT MIGHT BE IN AN APARTMENT WINDOW, WOULD BE THE SAME THING AS SINGLE-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL MIGHT PUT IN THEIR YARD, BUT IT COULD -- I KNOW WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT CONTENT, BUT IT COULD BE A POLITICAL SIGN OR A FOR SALE SIGN OR A FOR LEASE, SO I WOULD FEEL THAT IN THE WINDOW, BECAUSE IT'S OBSTRUCTING, FEELS LIKE A TEMPORARY CONDITION, WHERE ON A WALL, AFFIXED TO KIND OF THE WALL OUTSIDE OF ANY RESIDENTIAL USE, FEELS MORE PERMANENT, BECAUSE IT'S NOT OBSTRUCTING ANOTHER FEATURE IN A WAY, AND SO IF WE ARE LEANING TOWARDS ALLOWING IT, IT FEELS LIKE IT ACTUALLY FALLS MORE INTO THE TEMPORARY THAN THE PERMANENT CATEGORY. I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT CHANGES THE AREA CALCULATIONS AND HOW THAT'S VETTED OUT, BUT THAT WOULD BE MY LEANING.
01:51:36.232: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  WE'LL LOOK AT OPTIONS TO ALLOW IT.
01:51:38.835: >> SO THAT IN A SINGLE FAMILY USE, WHEN YOU HAVE GOT FOUR SIGNS, IF YOU PUT THREE IN YOUR YARD AND ONE IN YOUR WINDOW, THEY ALL ADD UP TO THE SAME THING AND WE ARE NOT ADDING MORE TO IT. IT ALL FEELS TEMPORARY, IN MY PERSPECTIVE. AND THEN WE ARE EQUALLY TRYING TO APPROACH ALL TYPES OF HOUSING AND RESIDENTIAL USES IN THE SAME WAY AND NOT THAT DENSE HOUSING HAS A PERMANENT SORT OF REQUIREMENT, WHERE SINGLE-FAMILY AND DETACHED HOUSING HAS A TEMPORARY.
01:52:10.600: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO RESPOND TO THE ZONING DISTRICTS WHERE IT'S LOCATED, BUT WE'LL LOOK AT HOW TO ACCOMPLISH THAT IN AN EQUAL MANNER.
01:52:18.441: >> YEAH, I THINK THAT'S KIND OF MY CONCERN, WHEN WE DO TALK ABOUT THAT USE VERSUS ZONING, BUT WE HAVE TO START SOMEWHERE, RIGHT? BUT THE EQUITY BETWEEN WHO LIVES WHERE AND THE TYPOLOGY OF IT.
01:52:33.923: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  I AM HEARING CONSIDER REMOVAL OF THE EXCEPTION FOR A SINGLE FREE-STANDING SIGN, NOT SUBJECT TO THE TIME LIMITATIONS. I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT IT IS CONCEIVABLE THAT WHEN THAT COMES BACK, MY INITIAL THOUGHT IS THAT THAT IS -- THAT'S A BIT OF A -- AN ACCOMMODATION FROM AN ABSOLUTE FREE SPEECH OPPORTUNITY FOR ANY PROPERTY OWNER, BUT WE'LL LOOK AT IT. AND THEN THE PROVISION OF A PERMANENT SIGN FOR SINGLE AND TWO-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL. I HEARD A COUPLE OF COMMENTS ABOUT THAT. I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S A UNIFIED VISION. I WONDER WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE IN REGARDS TO THAT.
01:53:33.182: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  I DIDN'T HEAR -- I THINK THIS IS FROM COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT, AND I DIDN'T HEAR A SINGLE SIGN, LIKE TAKING IT FROM FOUR TO ONE. I HEARD THE EXCEPTION OF ALLOWING ONLY ONE OF THOSE SIGNS TO BE UP DURING THE PERIOD OF LEASE, NOT ALL FOUR, NOT ALL TEMPORARY SIGNS.
01:53:55.972: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT: WAIT, IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, OR A SIGN ON A --
01:54:04.280: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  A PERMANENT WALL SIGN UP TO THREE SQUARE FEET ON A ONE OR TWO-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL. WE DID TALK ABOUT THAT AS WELL THOUGH. IS THERE ANY CONSENSUS ON THAT?
01:54:15.425: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  COULD WE ADD, AND THIS IS CONTROLLING WHAT'S ON THAT SIGN --
01:54:19.462: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  THEN NO.
01:54:21.331: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  WHAT IF IT'S CONTACT INFORMATION ONLY, PHONE NUMBER ONLY?
01:54:27.470: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  MY INITIAL REACTION IS THAT IS RESTRICTING BY CONTENT.
01:54:33.109: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS:  WHAT IF YOU LOWER IT FROM FREE SQUARE FEET TO ONE?
01:54:38.448: >> THAT'S TOO SMALL.
01:54:39.449: >> ONE AND A HALF SQUARE FOOT?
01:54:40.550: >> ONE BY ONE, SO A PHONE NUMBER AND --
01:54:43.119: >> YOU ALMOST HAVE TO BE ON THEIR PROPERTY TO READ IT.
01:54:48.791: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  OR --
01:54:49.359: >> OR TWO SQUARE FEET? I THINK THAT WOULD BE A -- BUT THE REALITY -- WELL...  I WOULD BE IN FAVOR OF ELIMINATING -- OR OF NOT ELIMINATING SIGNS, WHETHER IT'S THREE SQUARE FEET, ONE SQUARE FOOT OR TWO SQUARE FEET, IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER TO ME. LANDLORDS WILL FIGURE OUT A WAY TO MAKE IT STAND OUT, I'M ASSUMING, SO IT'S NOT GOING TO BE A WHITE HOUSE WITH A WHITE SIGN, FOR EXAMPLE. HOW ABOUT A FOOT AND A HALF? [ LAUGHTER ] COMMISSIONER MILLS?
01:55:29.732: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  I WOULD PREFER THAT IF WE KEEP IN THE IDEA OF THIS UNLIMITED TIME SINGLE SIGN THAT IT -- I WOULD PREFER IT IN A WINDOW RATHER THAN FREE STANDING, PERSONALLY. I WOULD PUT THAT OUT THERE.
01:55:51.754: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT: I THOUGHT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT A WALL, WALL SIGNS.
01:55:55.558: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  YEAH.
01:56:00.063: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  [ OFF MIC ] --
01:56:00.930: >> ABOUT PUTTING BACK IN THE WALL SIGN, ALLOWING ONE SMALL PERMANENT WALL SIGN ON ONE OR TWO FAMILY RESIDENCES.
01:56:07.970: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  YEAH. COMMISSIONER SAUVE?
01:56:10.273: >> COMMISSIONER SAUVE:  THE CIRCUMSTANCES, IT'S THINKING ABOUT THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT WE SET UP TO THE CONTENT THAT MIGHT BE PROVIDED, BECAUSE WE CAN'T REGULATE CONTENT, SO IT'S HOW DO WE CREATE A CIRCUMSTANCE THAT ENABLES THE CONTENT THAT WE THINK IS APPROPRIATE, AND SO A PERMANENT WALL SIGN OF A CERTAIN SCALE, OF A HOUSE THAT'S LEASED OR RENTED, THE LESSEE ISN'T GOING TO PUT -- AFFIX A PERMANENT SIGN TO NOT THEIR PROPERTY, SO ALLOWING THAT PERMANENT SIGN IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE DONE BY THE MANAGEMENT OR THE OWNER. AND SO THE CONTENT IS GOING TO BE SOMETHING CURATED BY THE MANAGEMENT OR THE OWNER. SO I FEEL LIKE THAT LEADS, YOU KNOW, TOWARDS THE MANAGEMENT NUMBER AND CONTACT INFORMATION, WITHOUT ACTUALLY TRYING TO CONTROL WHAT IT IS, RIGHT? IF WE DO IT WITH THE TEMPORARY FREE-STANDING FOREVER DURATION SIGN, THAT IS A BIT MORE MUDDY IN TERMS OF -- LIKE A TENANT COULD JUST PUT A SIGN OUT AND LET IT SIT OUT FROM NOVEMBER TO AUGUST, SO -- AND I THINK WHAT IT WOULD DO, IF WE REVERTED BACK TO THE WALL SIGN, IS IT PROVIDES THAT PERMANENT FREE SPEECH OPPORTUNITY, SO IF A TENANT WANTED TO STICK SOMETHING ON TOP OF THAT CONTACT INFORMATION, THEY COULD, SO THAT THERE IS THAT PERMANENT FREE SPEECH ABILITY ON THE WALL INSTEAD OF IN THE YARD BLIGHT SORT OF SCENARIO. SO I THINK THOSE TWO GO HAND IN HAND, THAT WE TRADE OFF AND FIND THAT BALANCE AND FIGURE OUT HOW THAT SCENARIO HELPS LEAD TOWARDS THE CONTENT THAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR WITHOUT CURATING THE CONTENT. BRETT, DOES THAT MAKE SENSE? SO, BASICALLY I THINK I'M GOING TOWARDS THE WALL SIGN [ LAUGHTER ], BECAUSE IT ALLOWS US TO REDACT THE TEMPORARY PERMANENT FREE-STANDING SIGN.
01:57:59.782: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  POSSIBLY.
01:58:00.416: >> AND ENABLE PERMANENT FREE SPEECH, BUT IN A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE PEOPLE ARE LEASING IT, IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE THE MANAGEMENT OR THE OWNER THAT IS GOING TO PUT THE CONTENT ON THAT.
01:58:13.296: >> OR, CAN YOU -- IF WE KEPT THE TEMPORARY UNLIMITED WHATEVER, CAN YOU LIMIT THE PERMANENT WALL SIGNS TO JUST PROPERTIES FOR RENT? BECAUSE THAT'S NOT REGULATING CONTENT. OR IS THAT NOT CONSTITUTIONAL?
01:58:30.046: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  MY INITIAL REACTION IS I DON'T LIKE THE DISTINCTION OF CHANGING REGULATIONS BASED ON THE OCCUPANCY TENURE. A SINGLE FAMILY AND A SINGLE FAMILY RENTAL PROPERTY SHOULD BE CONSIDERED I THINK THE SAME IN REGULATIONS. IT IS CONSIDERED DIFFERENTLY THROUGH OTHER BUILDING CODE REQUIREMENTS, BUT MY INITIAL REACTION IS THAT A YES PROBABLY DIFFICULT FROM A -- IS THAT IS PROBABLY DIFFICULT FROM A ZONING PERSPECTIVE.
01:59:00.843: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN: COMMISSIONER BRIGGS?
01:59:01.744: >> COMMISSIONER BRIGGS:  SINCE THIS IS GETTING TABLED, IT APPEARS, THIS IS ONE AREA WHERE I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FEEDBACK FROM NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATIONS AND WHAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE. I WOULD DEFER A LOT ON THE WALL SIGN PIECE OF THAT, WHETHER OR NOT THEY WOULD FEEL THAT HAVING THAT CONTACT INFORMATION WOULD CONTINUE TO BE USEFUL, BUT I DO LIKE THE IDEA THAT IF IT'S GOING TO BE MAINTAINED THAT IT'S A SMALLER SIZE. PERSONALLY, I LIKED THE REMOVAL OF THE WALL SIGNS, BUT I COULD BE PERSUADED IF IT FELT LIKE SOMETHING THAT'S ACTUALLY BENEFITING NEIGHBORHOODS AND FOLKS THAT ARE LIVING THERE THAT ARE REGULARLY ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES. WITH REGARDS TO THE UNLIMITED SIGN, JUST TO THROW IN ONE OTHER PIECE, I KNOW YOUR CONCERN IS AROUND FREE SPEECH. TO ME, IT SEEMS THAT WE ARE FAVORING FREE SPEECH FOR THOSE FOLKS WHO HAVE A YARD AND HAVE THE ABILITY TO PUT UP A FREE-STANDING SIGN, SO I THINK WE ARE PROVIDING GREATER SPEECH FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF INDIVIDUALS IN OUR COMMUNITY, AND SO I WOULD BE CURIOUS TO SEE, AS YOU GUYS ARE DISCUSSING THIS AFTER THIS MEETING, HOW THAT PLAYS OUT. BUT I'M NOT PERSUADED, NECESSARILY, THAT WE ARE OFFERING MORE. BUT I'M NOT A LAWYER, SO...
02:00:21.123: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  SO THE POINT WOULD BE THAT IF PROVIDED, IT SHOULD BE ONE TEMPORARY SIGN, NOT ONE TEMPORARY FREE-STANDING SIGN.
02:00:31.867: >> UH-HUH.
02:00:33.135: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  UH-HUH.
02:00:35.104: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  OKAY.
02:00:36.372: >> PERSONALLY, I DON'T THINK WE NEED UNLIMITED SIGNS.
02:00:38.607: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  AND THEN OPEN HOUSE SIGNS, GARAGE SALE SIGNS? [ LAUGHTER ].
02:00:50.453: >> NO.
02:00:53.789: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  A GARAGE SALE SIGN OR AN ESTATE SALE OR SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES, IF WE COULD, YOU KNOW, HAVE SOME --
02:01:01.530: >> LEEWAY?
02:01:02.431: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  YOU KNOW, TEXT ABOUT THAT FOR US TO READ, THAT WOULD BE GREAT.
02:01:06.135: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  SO YOU WOULD BE INTERESTED IN SOME EXCEPTION THAT SAYS YOU CAN DO ANY TEMPORARY SIGN AT ANY LOCATION SO LONG AS IT'S NOT PRESENT FOR MORE THAN FOUR HOURS?
02:01:18.514: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  OR EIGHT.
02:01:24.920: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  I'M A SOFT NO ON THAT, BUT WE CAN LOOK AT IT.
02:01:31.994: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  THAT'S ALL I ASK.
02:01:33.329: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  OKAY. SO, MY TO-DO IS LOOK AT ELIMINATING THE REQUIREMENT FOR PERMITS FOR ALL TEMPORARY SIGN PERMITS, LOOK AT THE POTENTIAL REGULATION OR PROVISION OF RESIDENTIAL WINDOW SIGNS, PERHAPS AS A TEMPORARY OPTION; EVALUATE THE UNLIMITED TEMPORARY FREE-STANDING SIGN, COULD IT BE ELIMINATED? IF KEPT, COULD IT BE GENERALIZED TO PROVIDE MORE CHOICE AS TO HOW IT'S REALIZED AS A TEMPORARY SIGN, INSTEAD OF JUST FREE-STANDING? IS THERE ANY SPECIFIC PROVISION FOR TEMPORARY TIME-LIMITED SIGNS, AND ADDING BACK IN -- POTENTIALLY ADDING BACK IN SINGLE AND TWO-FAMILY THREE-SQUARE FOOT SIGN, AND SPECIFICALLY TRYING TO SOLICIT FEEDBACK FROM THE COMMUNITY ABOUT THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE. DOES THAT SEEM LIKE THE LIST?
02:02:45.468: >> IS MY THING ABOUT IS YOUR PROPERTY FOR LEASE --
02:02:50.473: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  ONE SIGN OR ALL SIGNS.
02:02:52.875: >> YEAH.
02:02:55.878: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN: COMMISSIONER WOODS?
02:02:56.779: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS:  YEAH, I'M -- SO THAT LAST PART YOU SAID, THAT'S ABOUT THOSE SMALL SIGNS THAT GO ON HOUSES SOMETIMES THAT HAVE THE INFORMATION. IT SEEMS LIKE WITH TECHNOLOGY, AND JUST ANECDOTALLY FROM A LOT OF MY STUDENTS, IT SEEMS LIKE PEOPLE DO A LOT MORE ONLINE AND GOING TO -- I DON'T EVEN KNOW THE NAMES OF THE APPS, BUT TO FIND OUT WHERE PROPERTY AND THINGS LIKE THAT ARE AVAILABLE, AS OPPOSED TO LOOKING AT THOSE SIGNS. SO HOPEFULLY EVENTUALLY WE ARE SORT OF GETTING AWAY FROM THOSE, EVEN THOUGH I KNOW, NO, WE ARE NOT. WELL, WE SHOULD, BECAUSE I THINK IT'S JUST ADDING TO WHAT SOME PEOPLE ARE FEELING IS NOT THE BEST LOOK FOR THE NEIGHBORHOODS. SO I JUST WANTED TO PUT THAT IN THERE. OKAY. ALL RIGHT. I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN KNOWING WHAT PERCENT OF YOUR SALES ARE ACTUALLY FROM THE ONLINE KINDS OF, YOU KNOW, REALTY PROGRAMS AS OPPOSED TO PEOPLE JUST DRIVING DOWN THE STREET AND SEEING IT ON A HOUSE.
02:04:03.479: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  DON'T GET HIM STARTED.
02:04:06.282: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS:  OKAY, NEVER MIND [ LAUGHTER ]. WELL, YOU CAN TELL US LATER.
02:04:10.553: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  I WILL MENTION THIS, THE REASON WHY I LIKE FOR SALE SIGNS IS WHEN I'M DRIVING THROUGH A NEIGHBORHOOD AND I'M GOING TO SHOW A HOUSE, I DON'T HAVE TO LOOK AT THE STREET NUMBERS. I JUST SEE THE FOR SALE SIGN, AND I KNOW I NEED TO PULL IN THAT DRIVEWAY, AND IN SOME NEIGHBORHOODS THAT HAVE A LOT OF COOKIE CUTTER HOMES, IT'S VERY HELPFUL TO HAVE THAT SIGN THERE. BUT THAT'S MY -- AS A REAL ESTATE AGENT, THAT'S WHY I LIKE FOR SALE SIGNS.
02:04:36.478: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS:  AND YOU DON'T USE GPS AND ALL OF THAT STUFF?
02:04:39.448: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  IT SAYS YOU'RE HERE, AND YOU'RE LOOKING AROUND LIKE, OH, I'M NOT REALLY HERE.
02:04:43.752: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS:  ALL RIGHT. THAT'S ENOUGH OF A COMMERCIAL BREAK. WE'LL GET BACK TO --
02:04:48.424: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  ALL RIGHT. MR. LENART, DO YOU HAVE ENOUGH FEEDBACK SO THAT WE CAN TABLE THIS?
02:04:54.597: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  YES. MY TABLING WOULD ALLOW US TO BRING IT BACK WHEN WE FEEL LIKE WE HAVE ADDRESSED ALL OF THE QUESTIONS, GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY FOR SOME ADDITIONAL FEEDBACK. MY INITIAL THOUGHT IS THAT I MIGHT SHOOT FOR THE FIRST -- THE SECOND JANUARY OR THE FIRST FEBRUARY MEETING.
02:05:10.512: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  ALL RIGHT. DO I HAVE A MOTION TO TABLE? MOVED BY COMMISSIONER MILLS, SECOND BY COMMISSIONER WOODS. ANY DISCUSSION ON TABLING? ALL OF THOSE IN FAVOR, PLEASE SAY AYE. [ CHORUS OF AYES ] OPPOSED? ALL RIGHT. WE ARE TABLED. NEXT ITEM ON OUR AGENDA IS 2260 TRAVER ROAD ANNEXATION AND ZONING FOR CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL. MR. LENART, MR. CHANG WILL DELIVER A STAFF REPORT.
02:05:37.106: >> OKAY. THE PETITIONER IS LOCATED ON THE EAST SIDE OF TRAVER ROAD, SOUTH OF TRAVER BOULEVARD. THEY ARE IN ANN ARBOR TOWNSHIP. THEY ARE REQUESTING TO ANNEX 3.5 ACRES, REZONING TO R1B, SINGLE-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL. THE OWNER IS REQUESTING SEWER AND SANITARY SERVICE FROM THE CITY, SINCE THEIR SEPTIC SYSTEM IS FAILING. STAFF RECOMMENDS APPROVAL. I'M HERE FOR ANY -- ANY COMMENTS YOU MAY HAVE.
02:06:12.808: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  ALL RIGHT. AT THIS TIME I WOULD LIKE TO OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING. IF THERE IS ANYONE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION WITH REGARDS TO THIS ITEM, PLEASE STEP UP TO THE PODIUM, STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS FOR THE RECORD, AND YOU'LL HAVE UP TO THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION FOR THIS ITEM. SEEING NOBODY, I WILL CLOSE THE PRELIMINARY HEARING AND I WILL READ THE MOTION. THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION HEREBY RECOMMENDS THAT THE MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL APPROVE THE ANNEXATION FOR THE SINGLE FAMILY DISTRICT ZONING 226 TRAVER ROAD, MOVED BY COMMISSIONER SAUVE, SECOND BY COMMISSIONER MILLS. DO WE HAVE DISCUSSION? SEEING NONE, ALL OF THOSE IN FAVOR, PLEASE SAY AYE. [ CHORUS OF AYES ] OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. WELCOME TO THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. ALL RIGHT. MOVING ON TO AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION, AT THIS TIME, ANY MEMBERS OF THE AUDIENCE MAY ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION. IF THERE ARE MEMBERS OF THE AUDIENCE, YOU HAVE UP TO THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION. PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS FOR THE RECORD.
02:07:21.176: >> JEFF CROCKETT, 506 EAST KINGSLEY, AND THIS EVENING I'M A HAPPY GUY. I APPRECIATE, AND THIS IS WHY THEY PAY YOU THE BIG BUCKS, TO LOOK AT ALL OF THIS REALLY COMPLICATED STUFF, SO I AM VERY GRATEFUL. I JUST -- WHEN, IF YOU WANT CITIZEN INPUT, YOU KNOW, GIVE US A CALL. WE'D BE HAPPY TO COME IN AND TALK. I APPRECIATE, ERICA, YOU MAKING THAT COMMENT. I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY THAT I THINK WE CAN DO BETTER IN ENFORCEMENT THAN THE CURRENT PLAN IN PLACE. I MEAN, THERE ARE THINGS, I WAS JUST THINKING THE OTHER DAY, WHY IS THE BURDEN ON THE NEIGHBORHOODS? WHY COULDN'T, FOR EXAMPLE, A PERSON WHO PUTS UP A SIGN SIMPLY TAKE A PICTURE OF THE SIGN? BECAUSE IF YOU TAKE A PICTURE OF THE SIGN ON YOUR CELL PHONE, YOU HAVE GOT A DATE, SO YOU HAVE SOME KIND OF EVIDENCE OF WHAT YOU HAVE DONE. SO IT WOULD BE THE OBLIGATION OF THE PERSON WHO SETS UP A TEMPORARY SIGN TO TAKE A PICTURE OF IT TO DATE IT, AND IF YOU'RE A COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISE, IT WOULD SEEM TO ME MORE IMPORTANT SO THAT YOU WOULD HAVE SOME PROOF. SO, IN OTHER WORDS, IF YOU DON'T HAVE THAT PROOF AND IT'S DRIVEN BY COMPLAINT, GUESS WHO DOES THE COMPLAINING? PEOPLE WHO ARE SORT OF WALKING AROUND, SORT OF LIKE US. SO WE MAKE A COMPLAINT, THERE IS AN INVESTIGATION, BUT THERE IS NO PROOF OF WHEN THE SIGN COMES UP. SO THE PROOF IS THE COMPLAINT. SO, IT COULD BE 30 DAYS, 45 DAYS WHEN WE ARE WALKING AROUND AND NOTICE THIS HOUSE AND WE MAKE A CALL, AND THE 60-DAY LIMIT STARTS FROM THE DAY THAT YOU MAKE THE COMPLAINT. SOMETHING IS NOT RIGHT WITH THAT. THE OTHER THING THAT COULD BE DONE THAT WOULD BE SIMPLE, I MEAN, YOU CAN CREATE AN ONLINE SURVEY, WHERE SOMEONE WHO SETS UP A SIGN CAN GO AND JUST SIMPLY ENTER WHEN THEY PUT UP THE SIGN AT THE LOCATION. IT DOESN'T COST ANYTHING, BUT IT WOULD BE SOME WAY TO RECORD IT. SO I GUESS WHAT I'M ASKING IS IN TERMS OF ENFORCEMENT THAT YOU AT LEAST HAVE THE CONVERSATION TO THINK, IS THERE A WAY THAT WE CAN SORT OF DO IT BETTER, SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE THAT. AND THE LAST THING I WANTED TO SAY IS I'M HOPING THAT PART OF THE CONSIDERATION IS TIME, TIMING, SO THAT NEIGHBORHOODS AND NEIGHBORHOOD GROUPS HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW AN ORDINANCE, BECAUSE THE WAY IT'S SET UP RIGHT NOW, I MEAN, WE FIND OUT ABOUT IT ON A FRIDAY, WE DON'T HAVE THE STAFF HERE OVER THE WEEKEND, SO WE SEND IN FEEDBACK ON MONDAY, THERE'S JUST NO TIME. SOMETHING IS NOT RIGHT WITH THAT. I KNOW AT CITY COUNCIL, I THINK THEY ARE MOVING TOWARD, YOU KNOW, AT LEAST A WEEK BETWEEN THE TIME THAT A STAFF REPORT COMES IN AND WHEN THERE'S FEEDBACK. THAT TO ME IS A LITTLE MORE REASONABLE, SO I WOULD URGE YOU, YOU KNOW, BASICALLY TO THINK ABOUT -- CREATIVELY ABOUT ENFORCEMENT, AND THEN IN TERMS OF THE TIMING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
02:10:14.683: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION? SEEING NO ONE, ANY COMMISSION PROPOSED BUSINESS? COMMISSIONER MILLS.
02:10:33.635: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  I AM SAD THAT MR. GARBER LEFT, BECAUSE I THINK WHAT HE HAD TO SAY FITS NICELY TO WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT BEFORE WITH P
