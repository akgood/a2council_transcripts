WE ASK THAT SIGNS BE KEPT DOWN, ESPECIALLY BELOW SHOULDER LEVEL SO PEOPLE BEHIND YOU CAN SEE OVER YOUR SHOULDERS TO THE FRONT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. DO WE HAVE AN INTRODUCTION TODAY?
00:04:40.965: >> WE DO. IT'S A GREAT MEASURE TO INTRODUCE MS. JENNIFER HALL. AS WE TALKED ABOUT TONIGHT, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A PRESENTATION ON THE STATUS OF THE WORK ON USING CITY-OWNED PROPERTIES FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SORRY ABOUT THAT. SO I'M GOING TO TURN THE FLOOR OVER TO MS. HALL.
00:05:15.032: >> IS THIS ALL LOADED UP? JACKIE, IS IT LOADED UP, THE PRESENTATION? I DON'T SEE IT ON MY SCREEN.
00:05:47.365: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
00:05:48.032: >> I CAN START?
00:05:49.000: >> Mayor Taylor: YOU HAVE THE FLOOR. PLEASE DO.
00:05:50.168: >> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. WE ARE WAITING FOR THE PRESENTATION TO BE LOADED ON THE SCREEN. WHILE WE'RE WAITING, I DO WANT TO MAKE AN ANNOUNCEMENT. THERE ARE SOME FLYERS AT THE FRONT ON THE DAIS OVER THERE ABOUT THE HOUSING AFFORDABILITY IN ANN ARBOR. WE ARE HAVING SOME COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT SESSIONS IN THE BEGINNING OF DECEMBER FROM DECEMBER 5th THROUGH DECEMBER 9th, AROUND TWO SPECIFIC SITES. THE OLD WEISS SITE AT 350 SOUTH 5th AND 415 WEST WASHINGTON. WE ARE HAVING AN OPEN HOUSE-STYLE ENGAGEMENT WITH THE PUBLIC. WE WELCOME FOLKS TO COME OUT ON ANY OF THOSE DATES AT FIVE DIFFERENT LOCATIONS. AND THERE IS ALSO A WEBSITE WHERE PEOPLE CAN PROVIDE INPUT ON WHAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE IN THE COMMUNITY AROUND AFFORDABLE HOUSING, AND HOW THAT WOULD IMPACT THEM. ALL RIGHT. I WILL JUST GET STARTED K. STAR. CAN COUNCIL SEE THE PRESENTATION? WELL THANK YOU TO THE MAYOR AND THE CITY COUNCIL TO DIRECT STAFF FOR UNDERUTILIZED CITY-OWNED PROPERTY FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. I BELIEVE IT'S A WELL-ESTABLISHED FACT THAT WE NEED MORE HOUSING, TO SENIORS, LOW-INCOME FAMILIES, SPECIAL NEEDS HOUSEHOLDS, HOMELESS HOUSEHOLDS, PEOPLE WORKING IN THE SERVICE INDUSTRY, AND YOUNG PROFESSIONALS. IT IS HARD TO SOLVE ALL THE COMMUNITY'S HOUSING PROBLEMS IN ONE LOCATION. THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO DO A PORTFOLIO ANALYSIS NO TO MAKE SITE-SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATION. I ALSO WANT TO THANK MANY CITY AND COUNTY STAFF WHO HELPED ME WITH THIS ANALYSIS. APRIL 1st, 2019, CITY COUNCIL ADOPTED R-19-138, DIRECTING THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR NO PROVIDE COORDINATOR ANALYSIS ON THE FEASIBILITY OF CITY-OWNED PROPERTIES AS POTENTIAL LOCATIONS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THERE WERE SIX GOALS WITHIN THAT RESOLUTION. GOAL ONE WAS TO MAINTAIN OWNERSHIP OF THE PROPERTY THROUGH A LAND LEASE WHICH ALLOWS THE PUBLIC TO CAPTURE THE VALUE OF THE LAND AND CONTROL THE FUTURE OF THE PROPERTY RATHER THAN SELL IT TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR. A LAND LEASE AND I SOMETIMES CALL IT A GROUND LEASE. IT FORGOES CASH FROM A SALE TO A MARKET RATE DEVELOPMENT. ESPECIALLY, YOU ARE LEASING THE AIR RIGHTS OR THE ABILITY TO HAVE AIR RIGHTS. EVERY SITE INCLUDES ONE SCENARIO WITH A GROUND LEASE AND WE ALSO INCLUDED AN APPRAISED VALUE SO THAT COUNCIL HAS THE INFORMATION NEEDED TO DETERMINE WHETHER A PROPERTY SHOULD BE DEVELOPED AS AFOR THIBLE HOUSING OR SOLD SO THAT THE SALE PROCEEDS CAN BE USED FOR OTHER PURPOSES. THIS STRIVED TO DIFFERENT UNIT TYPES AND RENT LEVELS WHICH IS UNDER GOAL TWO. UNDER GOAL THREE, WE ALSO STRIVED TO MAXIMIZE THE NUMBER OF 60% A.M.I. OR LESS UNITS, WHICH IS SOMETIMES INCOMPATIBLE WITH GOAL TWO BUT WE DID INCLUDE AN OPTION TO ENSURE THAT ALL UNITS ARE AT 60% A.M.I. OR LESS, WHICH WOULD ACTUALLY REQUIRE A LOCAL MILLAGE TO SUPPORT IT. IT WAS PRESUMED THAT GOAL FOUR WAS TO INCLUDE HOUSING CHOICE VOUCHERS ON THE UNITS WOULD BE INCLUDED HAS NO MATERIAL IMPACT ON THIS FINANCIAL ANALYSIS. GOAL 5 PRIMARILY NEEDS TO BE ACCOMPLISHED AT ONE LOCATION, WHICH IS TO HAVE A CONSOLIDATED. HOUSING MISSION OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE FACILITY, AND WE SPENT NOT VERY MUCH TIME ON GOAL SIX, WHICH WAS LOOKING AT OTHER USES FOR THE SITES BESIDES HOUSING, SIMPLY DUE TO TIME CONSTRAINTS. OKAY. SORRY ABOUT THAT. I WILL SPEND A FEW MINUTES TO TALK ABOUT WHY WE ARE DOING THIS ANALYSIS. THEN I WILL EXPLAIN THE FACTORS THAT WE LOOKED AT TO DETERMINE WHETHER A SITE IS FINANCIALLY FEASIBLE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND THEN I WILL PROVIDE A SITE-BY-SITE ANALYSIS FOR OUR RECOMMENDATIONS. THE RECOMMENDATIONS REMAIN FROM DEVELOP RIGHT NOW BECAUSE IT SCORES SO HIGH FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUNDING UNDER THE CURRENT MARKET THAT IT WOULD BE A LOST OPPORTUNITY NOT TO DEVELOP THE SITES RIGHT NOW. KEEPING IN MIND IT TAKES MANY YEARS FROM CONTENT TO ACTUALLY PEOPLE IN THE HOUSING. SO DEVELOPING RIGHT NOW IS A THREE TO FIVE-YEAR PROCESS. THE SECOND RECOMMENDATION IS TO DEVELOP THE AFTER COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT, BECAUSE EITHER THE SITES ARE VERY COMPLICATED OR SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTFUL AND ARE NOT QUITE READY TO DEVELOP RIGHT NOW CATEGORY, BUT WE WANTED TO HAVE MORE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT. A THIRD RECOMMENDATION IS TO CONDUCT FURTHER STUDDIE TO FIGURE OUT THE BEST TYPE OF DEVELOPMENT OR HOW TO FINANCE THE DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE IT WASN'T A GREAT SITE FOR TYPICAL HOUSING FINANCE THAT WE NORMALLY USE. KEEP IN MIND THE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND FURTHER STUDY CAN HAPPEN SIMULTANEOUSLY, THEY ARE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE AND FINALLY SOME SITES ARE NOT RECOMMENDED FOR DEVELOPMENT DUE TO SIGNIFICANT SITE ISSUES. IF PEOPLE ARE DOWNLOADING THIS PRESENTATION FROM THE CITY'S WEBSITE, AT THE VERY END OF THE PRESENTATION, THERE ARE SOME DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION, SOME INCOME TARGET INFORMATION AND INFORMATION ABOUT THE COMMUNITY THAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL BUT I WILL NOT BE GOING OVER IT TONIGHT, UNLESS THERE ARE QUESTIONS. IF THERE IS SUCH A HUGE DEMAND FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING, WHY IS THE PRIVATE SECTOR NOT BUILDING IT? IT'S NOT FINANCIALLY FEASIBLE. THERE ARE NATURALLY OCCURRING AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE CITY, AND THERE ARE SUBSIDIZED HOUSING PROJECTS IN THE CITY BUT THE DEMAND FAR EXCEEDS WHAT IS AVAILABLE. IT CAN'T BE BUILT WITHOUT SUBSIDY, GRANT, LOW-COST LONES INCREASED DENSITY THAT CAN SPREAD THE COST, AND SUBSIDIZE THE AFFORDABLE MARKETING UNITS IN THE LIKE. THE LARGEST EXISTING FUNDING PROGRAMS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING ARE COMPETITIVE AND CAN ONLY PROVIDE A FRACTION OF THE NEED. ONLY 25% OF HOUSEHOLDS IN THE UNITED STATES WOULD INCOME QUALIFIED FOR SUBSIDIZED HOUSING ACTUALLY LIVE IN SUBSIDIZED HOUSING. NO MATTER WHAT IP T TYPE OF DEVELOPMENT IS DO, IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS MARKET DRIVEN, IT IS HIGH RISK AND IT IS VERY SITE SPECIFIC. IIF YOU REMEMBER 2007, 2008, THY WERE VARIOUS PROPERTIES IN SITE APPROVAL. FINANCING DRIED UP AND THOSE ITEMS DID NOT GET BUILT. AND DEVELOPERS COULD LOSE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. IN A HOT MARK LIKE ANN ARBOR, AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS CANNOT COMPETE WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO PURCHASE PROPERTY BECAUSE IT CAN TAKE US A MINIMUM OF TWO YEARS TO SECURE THE TYPE OF FINANCING THAT WE NEED AND UNLESS YOU HAVE A SYMPATHETIC SELLER WHO IS WAITING FOR YOU TO GET YOUR MONEY TO GO, THEN YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO COMPETE. THAT'S WHY THIS PROFOUNDING IMPORTANT. THE CITY CAN SIT ON THE PROPERTIES FOR YEARS. THE PROPERTY CAN CONTINUE TO FUNCTION AS IT DID UNTIL IT'S TIME TO BEGIN CONSTRUCTION. THIS CHART IS AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE DIFFERENCE IN RENT REVENUE GENERATED BY -- GENERATED AND OPERATING EXPENSES OF  A MARKET RATE PROPERTY ON THE FAR LEFT, COMPARED TO AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECT WITH ALL UNITS AT 60% A.M. I. AND ON THE FAR RIGHT A PROJECT SERVING EVEN LOWER INCOMES. MOST MARKET RATE PROJECTS ARE FINANCED WITH A COMBINATION OF EQUITY AND DEBT. EQUITY IS REPAID FROM AVAILABLE CASH FLOW TO INVESTORS AND IT CAN FLUCTUATE. DEBT IS REPAID ON A FIXED SCHEDULE AND IS TYPICALLY TO A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION. SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT BUYING A HOUSE, THAT WOULD BE YOUR MORTGAGE. ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS THE LOWER THE RENT, THE LESS DEBT THE PROPERTY CAN ABSORB AND THAT MEANS GRANT-LIKE FUNDING IS NEEDED TO MAKE IT FINANCIALLY FEASIBLE. IF YOU LOOK AT THIS CHART, THE LIGHT BLUE OPERATING COSTS ON THE VERY BOTTOM ARE GENERALLY THE SAME ACROSS ALL OF THE TYPES OF PROPERTIES. IT INCLUDES YOUR MAINTENANCE COSTS YOUR PROPERTY MANAGEMENT COSTS, THE DIFFERENCES ON THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNIT IS A LITTLE BIT HIGHER BECAUSE YOU HAVE MANY MORE REGULATORY COMPLIANCE. BECAUSE YOU NEED MORE HOUSING AND YOU NEED INCOME CERTIFICATIONS. AND IF YOU ARE SERVING SPECIAL NEEDS AND HOMELESS HOUSEHOLDS THEY HAVE EVEN HIGHER STAFFING REQUIREMENTS. MARKET RATE DEVELOPMENTS TAKE ON MORE DEBT WHICH IS SHOWN IN ORANGE. AND THEREFORE, A LARGE PORTION OF THE REPRESENT GOES TOWARDS PAYING OFF THIS DEBT. IN CONTRAST WITH THE AFFORDABLE UNITS THAT CANNOT TAKE ON AS MUCH DEBT BECAUSE THE RENTS ARE NOT HIGH ENOUGH. THEY HAVE THE FUTURE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. THE MARK RATE HOUSING PAYS SIGNIFICANT TAXES WHICH IS SHOWN IN YELLOW, WHILE IN THE SCENARIO FOR THE AFFORDABLE PROJECTS THEY ARE ASSUMED TO HAVE A PILOT WHICH IS PAYMENT IN LIEU OF TAXES AND IT'S BASICALLY A DOLLAR PER UNIT PER YEAR. FINALLY, THE DARK BLUE AT THE TOP IS THE RETURN ON INVESTMENT FOR MARKET RATE DEVELOPERS. FOR THE AFFORDABLE UNITS, IT IS JUST ENOUGH EXCESS CASH FLOW OR NET OPERATING INCOME TO COVER THE DEBT COVERAGE RATIO ON THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS. WHEN A NONPROFIT DEVELOPER DOES AFFORDABLE HOUSING, THEY TAKE THAT EXCESS CASH FLOW, AFTER IT'S BEEN AUDITED, AND THEY CAN RE-INVEST IT IN THEIR PROPERTIES FOR TENANT SERVICES OR USE IT FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT. NOW TO THE MEAT OF THE ANALYSIS. THIS IS A SUMMARY OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND I WILL EXPLAIN NEXT HOW WE REACHED THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS. WE ARE VERY COMPETENT IN THE DETAILED ANALYSIS THAT WE PROVIDED BASED ON THE CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS. OUR ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT THESE PUBLIC SITES COMBINED COULD ADD OVER 1400 HOUSING UNITS IN OUR HOUSING MARKET, WHICH WOULD MAKE A BIG DENT IN THE 2015 HOUSING AFFORDABILITY NEEDS ASSESSMENT RECOMMENDING 104 UNITS PER YEAR. THE WRITTEN ANALYSIS INCLUDES THREE PORTFOLIOS WITH DIFFERENT APPROACHES. FIRST, WE DID A MIXTURE OF OWNER, RENTAL, CO-OP, FOR-PROFIT AND NONPROFIT. AND ALL OF THE SITES ASSUMED A GROUND LEASE. THE SECOND PORTFOLIO RECOMMENDED DEVELOPING THE EASIER TO SELL PROPERTIES AND THEN SELLING OFF THE DIFFICULT OR THE HIGH-VALUE PROPERTIES TO FINANCIALLY SUPPORT THE EASIER TO DEVELOP PROPERTIES. FOR THE THIRD PORTFOLIO, WE GO ALL-IN ON MAXIMIZING THE NUMBER OF 60% A.M.I. UNITS, AND THE THIRD PORTFOLIO APPROACH, WE APPLY FOR TAX CREDITS WHERE WE CAN, AND USE HOUSING REVENUE BONDS, AND LOCAL FUNDING FOR THE REST, INCLUDING A HOUSING MILLAGE. A HOUSING MILLAGE COULD BE USED FOR ACQUISITION OF EXISTING PROPERTIES IN THE MARK PLACE. -- MARKETPLACE. REGARDLESS OF WHICH APPROACH YOU LIKE, AND HOW YOU WANT TO MIX AND MATCH THE DIFFERENT PROPERTIES, OUR RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE NEXT STEPS REMAINS THE SAME. SO IN SUMMARY, WE ARE RECOMMENDING THAT CITY COUNCIL APPROVES STARTING THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS RIGHT NOW, FOR KATHERINE AND NORTH ASHLEY. THAT'S A THREE TO FOUR-YEAR PROCESS FROM CONCEPT TO COMPLETION, IF EVERYTHING GOES WELL. WE ARE RECOMMENDING STARTING COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT FOR SOUTH ASHLEY, PLATTE, AND NORTH MAIN, SIMILAR TO WHAT IS OCCURRING AT WEST WASHINGTON AND SOUTH 5th, PRIOR TO DEVELOPING THOSE SITES. THIS WILL ADD AT LEAST A YEAR TO THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS. WE ARE ALSO RECOMMENDING FURTHER STUDY OF INDUSTRIAL AND EAST STADIUM TO DETERMINE THE BEST DEVELOPMENT OPTIONS WHICH WILL ALSO ADD AN EXTRA YEAR TO THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS. AND WE DO NOT RECOMMEND HOUSING DEVELOPMENT ON BALDWIN OR THE 1st AND WILLIAM PARKING LOT. NEXT, I WILL TALK TO YOU ABOUT WHY WE REACHED THESE CONCLUSIONS AND WHAT WE EVALUATED. THE FIRST ITEM WE EVALUATED WERE POTENTIAL LAND USE RESTRICTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, DOES THE CITY HAVE OTHER PLANNING DOCUMENTS OR COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS THAT SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFY THE PROPERTIES FOR ANOTHER USE? WE DID AN EXTENSIVE ZONING ANALYSIS, COMPLETED BY CARLISLE WARTMAN THAT YOU CAN FIND ON THE HOUSING COMMISSION'S WEBSITE ALONG WITH OTHER SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS. IF YOU GO TO THE CITY'S WEBSITE AND LOOK UNDER DEPARTMENTS FOR HOUSING COMMISSION, AND CLICK ON OUR SITE, IT'S RIGHT THERE ON OUR HOME PAGE. THE ZONING ANALYSIS EVALUATED THE CURRENT ZONING WHICH IN SOME CASES WERE ALREADY ZONED APPROPRIATELY, ESPECIALLY IF IT WAS D1 OR D2 IN THE DOWNTOWN AND OTHER CASES IF IT WAS NOT PUBLIC LAND, WE HAD TO ADD SOME FOR SITES NOT IN THE DOWNTOWN, THE ZONING ANALYSIS INCLUDED SEVERAL POTENTIAL RECOMMENDATIONS AND COMPARED THEM TO EACH OTHER, PARTICULARLY ON DENSITY, PARKING, AND OPEN SPACE REQUIREMENTS. THE ANALYSIS CALCULATED THE NUMBER OF THE UNITS THAT COULD BE BUILT UNDER EACH ZONING USING THE SAME ASSUMPTIONS. SO FOR THE ZONING ANALYSIS, WE ASSUMED IT WAS 800 SQUARE FEET FOR EACH APARTMENT AND WE MADE IT APPLES-TO-APPLES AND WE USED 15% SQUARE FOOTAGE AS THE COMMON AREA. THE OPEN SPACE AND PARKING REQUIREMENTS WERE SHOWN AS THE MINIMAL AMOUNT REQUIRED. WE REALIZE THAT AS PUBLIC SITES, THE PUBLIC HAS GREAT AVAILABILITY, BUT FOR THE ANALYSIS, WE DECIDED TO USE ZONING REGULATIONS, THAT WERE REASONABLY COMPATIBLE WITH THE SURROUNDING NEIGHBORHOOD. FINALLY, WE LOOKED AT DEEDS AND COVENANTS THAT RESTRICT THE USE OF THE PROPERTY, TYPICALLY DUE TO A FINANCIAL REASON. SO FOR EXAMPLE, FEMA PROVIDED A GRANT TO REMOVE A BUILDING AT THE NORTH MAIN SITE, AND IN EXCHANGE, THE CITY AGREED TO A DEED RESTRICTION NOT TO BUILD IN THE FLOODWAY. ANOTHER TYPE OF LAND USE RESTRICTION IS IN THE CITY CHARTER, WHICH PROHIBITS THE SALE OF PARKLAND WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF CITY VOTERS. WE ALSO LOOKED AT ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS THAT CAN DETERMINE FUNDING SOURCES. IT CAN DETERMINE WHAT IS ELIGIBLE AND WHAT IS NOT ELIGIBLE. WE DON'T SPECIFICALLY HIGHLIGHT BROWNFIELD ELIGIBILITY FOR SITES BECAUSE EVERY SITE CAN BE ELIGIBLE FOR BROWNFIELD FUNDING, DEPENDING ON WHAT IS BUILT, AND WHO THE DEVELOPER S. IT CAN BE GRANTS AN LOANS AND TAX INCREMENT FINANCING. WHAT IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW IS THAT MANY AFFORDABLE HOUSING FINANCING SOURCES HAVE BROADER AND HIGHER STANDARDS THAN THE MARK RATE HOUSING DOES, DUE TO THE HISTORICAL CITING OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS NEXT TO THINGS LIKE TOXIC DUMPS, MARSHLANDS, HIGHWAYS AND OTHER POTENTIALLY HARMFUL LOCATIONS. THEREFORE, THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS WERE A CRITICAL PART OF THE ANALYSIS. SEVERAL SITES WERE RULED OUT FOR FEDERAL FUNDING, AND TAX CREDIT FUNDING, DUE TO THE PROXIMITY OF A RAILROAD, BUT THEY WERE NOT RULED OUT FOR HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. 9 C THE CAN CITY HAS CURRENT MAT RATE DEVELOPMENTS THAT ARE ALL CLOSE TO RAILROADS. THERE ARE WAYS TO BUILD IN NOISE MITIGATION IN THE DESIGN. YOU CANNOT USE FEDERAL FUNDS OR TAX CREDIT FINANCING. SO WE DID FINANCIAL MODELING, MANY DIFFERENT SCENARIOS, WELL OVER 100 TOTAL, MAYBE 200. I DON'T KNOW TO TEST WHAT WAS FINANCIALLY FEASIBLE. WE HAD RAN DIFFERENT KINDS OF SCENARIOS THAT AFFECTED THE DEVELOPMENT COSTS, THE OPERATING COSTS, SUCH AS THE BILLING CHARACTERISTICS. DOES IT HAVE FIRST FLOOR RETAILOR OTHER USES? WE LOOKED THE TENANT CHARACTERISTICS SUCH AS THE INCOME TARGET AND THE SQUARE FOOTAGE OF THE UNITS. SO IF YOU HAD 1,000 SQUARE FOOT, YOU COULD HAVE TWO BEDROOM, A SINGLE ONE. COULD YOU HAVE TWO ONE-BEDROOMS AND THREE EFFICIENCIES AND IT AFFECTS YOUR UNIT COUNT. WHICH ALSO OPERATES -- IMPACTS YOUR OPERATING REVENUE, YOUR DEVELOPMENT COSTS AND YOUR MARKETING. FOR CONSTRUCTION COSTS, AND CITY FEES, THEY ARE HUGE DRIVER OF THE TOTAL DEVELOPMENT COSTS. SO WE TRIED TO BE CONSERVATIVE AND AERR ERRED ON THE SIDE OF ME AND NOT LESS EXPENSIVE. WITH WE RAN FINANCIAL PRODUCTS WITH DIFFERENT TERMS AND INTEREST RATES. IF YOU HAVE A LOWER INTEREST RATE WITH A LONGER REPAYMENT DETERMINE, WILL DEVELOPER CAN BORROW MORE, WHICH MEANS YOU DON'T NEED AS MUCH GRANT FINANCING. YOU CAN CHANGE ANY OF THESE FACTORS AND IT CHANGES THE FINANCIAL FEASIBILITY TO THE PROJECT. AS OF OCTOBER 19th, WE WERE CONFIDENT IN OUR ANALYSIS, AND THEN ON NOVEMBER 4th, THIS BOARD -- THE CITY COUNCIL APPROVED A CHANGE TO THE D1 AND D2 ZONING REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND THE IMPACT WAS FAVORABLE BECAUSE IT ELIMINATED THE PARKING REQUIREMENTS FOR THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING DENSITY BONUS. THIS IS WHY I SAY IT'S VERY MARKET DRIVEN AND SITE SPECIFIC, BECAUSE ALREADY EVEN A MONTH AGO, WE HAD A DIFFERENT ANALYSIS THAT INCLUDES PARKING COSTS. SO PLEASE DON'T GET FIXATED ON SPECIFIC NUMBERS. IT'S VERY SAFE TO USE A 10% RANGE ABOVE OR BELOW ANY NUMBERS, WHETHER IT'S A UNIT NUMBER, OR THE COST, BECAUSE IT'S ALL MARKET DRIVEN, AND THINGS CAN CHANGE. THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES LISTED ON THE RIGHT SHOW SOME OF THE FINANCING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT YOU CAN BRAID TOGETHER TO MINIMIZE THE RISK. THE FINANCIAL SOURCES ALSO SHOW -- I'M SORRY. WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE TOP LINE IS BOTH ASTERISK AND HIGHLIGHTED FOR LOW-INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS, BECAUSE IT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT AND THE SINGLE LARGEST SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE UNITED STATES AND IT IS NOT A H.U.D. PROGRAM. IT IS AN I.R.S. PROGRAM. SO ANY PROPERTY THAT IS ELIGIBLE FOR TAX CREDITS AND CAN COMPETE FOR THOSE FUNDS AND SCORES HIGH, WE PRIORITIZE THEM FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. SOME PROJECTS WERE ELIGIBLE FOR TAX CREDITS BUT DID NOT SCORE VERY WELL TO COMPETE AND SO THEY WERE RANKED A LITTLE LOWER IN PRIORITY. THERE IS A WAY TO BRING THOSE SCORES UP, AND THAT IS TO COMPETE IN A SPECIAL TAX CREDIT SET ASIDE BECAUSE THERE'S FEWER PROS THAT COMPETE IN THAT TYPE OF SET ASIDE AND THAT IS IF YOU TARGET HOMELESS AND SPECIAL NEEDS POPULATIONS. THIS IS A CATEGORY THAT THE HOUSING COMMISSION AND AVALON HAVE COMPETED IN AND HAVE BEEN AWORDED FOR ALL OF OUR PROJECTSES HOWEVER, THIS DID NOT NEW ANY ASSUMPTIONS BECAUSE OF ANY OF THE SITES FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE SERVICE DOLLARS IN ORDER TO APPLY FOR THE SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. IF COUNCIL DEDICATES A NEW SERVICE FUNDING TO ONE OR MORE OF THE LOW SCORING TAX CREDIT SITES THEN THEY COULD COMPETE FOR TAX CREDITS WITH GREATER SUCCESS ON THOSE PROPERTIES. THE WRITTEN ANALYSIS INCLUDED A CHART OF LOCAL RESOURCES, INCLUDING GRANTS, LOWS AND WE CALCULATED THAT TO BE ABOUT $20 MILLION OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS FROM LOCAL SOURCES. AND THOSE COULD BE USED AT ALMOST ANY SITE. THE OTHER CONSIDERATIONS WAS WHO WAS THE DEVELOPER GOING TO BE? WHAT WAS THE OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE TO MEET THE GOALS OF THE MIXTURE OF HOUSING TYPES? THEY SITES WITH BE DONE BY FOR-PROFIT DEVELOPERS AND NONPROFITS AND THE HOUSING COMMISSION AND ANY OF THOSE CAN WORK. THE HOUSING COMMISSION WAS CREATED BY THE CITY IN THE 1960s TO DEVELOP, OWN AND MANAGE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WE ARE AFFORDABLE DEVELOPMENT ARM OF THE CITY AND A LOGICAL DEVELOPER. THE HOUSING COMMISSION IS A GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY WHOSE MISSION IS TO PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND AS A PART OF THE CITY, WE WOULD BE COMPLETELY TRANSPARENT WITH THE CITY COUNCIL ABOUT OUR DEVELOPMENT SOURCES, OUR DEVELOPMENT USES, OUR OPERATING REVENUE AND OUR OPERATING EXPENSES, HOWEVER, WE DO NOT HAVE AN ENDLESS CAPACITY TO DEVELOP ALL OF THESE PROPERTIES AT THE SAME TIME, ESPECIALLY VERY LARGE, COMPLICATED SITES LIKE SOUTH ASHLEY AND SO OTHER DEVELOPERS NEED TO BE CONSIDERED DEPENDING ON THE SITE. I WILL SKIP SOME OF THAT STUFF. ALL RIGHT. I WILL GO ON. SITE-BY-SITE, WHAT OUR ANALYSIS FOUND. I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT AS YOU GET TO EACH SLIDE, THERE'S A GRAY BLOB OF A BUILDING, THAT'S PURELY TO SHOW THE DENSITY THAT CAN BE PUT ON THAT SITE. IT IS NOT DESIGN OF THE BUILDING. OBVIOUSLY YOU NEED AN ARCHITECT TO DO THAT. SO THE FIRST SITE IS THE LOT ON THE CORNER KATHERINE AND 4th. YOU WILL NOTICE THERE ARE -- AS WE GO THROUGH, THERE'S GREEN STARS IF THERE'S A POSITIVE ASPECT. YOU WILL SEE RED CIRCLES WITH STRIKE THROUGHS FOR NEGATIVE ASPECTS AND BLUE TRIANGLES FOR ITEMS THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED BUT ARE NOT A DEAL KILLER. YOU CAN SEE BY THE SIX GREEN STARS IT'S A PERFECT SITE. IT'S AVAILABLE FOR TAX CREDITS AND H.U.D., AND D.D.A. FUNDING AND IT GIVES VERY -- RIGHT NOW THE TAX CREDIT SCORING GIVES YOU HIGH POINTS FOR WALK SCORES, ECONOMIC AND EMPLOYMENT CENTERS AND ACCESS TO SERVICES WHICH VERY MUCH FAVORS DOWNTOWN SITES OVER SITES THAT ARE NOT IN THE DOWNTOWN. IT'S VERY RARE FOR A PROJECT TO SCORE SO HIGHLY AS THIS SITE DID. WE HAVE FOUR TAX CREDIT PROJECTS AND NONE OF THEM SCORED THIS HIGH, BUT WE HAD TO COMPETE UNDER SUPPORTIVE HOUSING IN ORDER TO EVEN GET AWARDED YOU ARE TAX CREDITS. SO THERE IS MORE OF A URGENCY TO CELL CATHERINE AND FOURTH BECAUSE IT SCORES SO HIGHLY RIGHT NOW. WE ARE RECOMMENDING THAT THE HOUSING COMMISSION BE THE DEVELOPER OF THE SITE SO WE CAN MOVE FORWARD MORE QUICKLY. AS A DEVELOPER, WE WOULD DEVELOP THE UNITS TO LOW-INCOME WORKERS UP TO 60% A.M.I. WHICH IS GENERALLY HOUSEHOLDS IN THE $20 TO $50,000 RANGE. THE HOUSING COMMISSION CURRENTLY PROVIDES HOUSING TO LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS BECAUSE WE HAVE PROJECT-BASED VOUCHERS ON ALL OF OUR SITES. UNFORTUNATELY WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH VOUCHERS TO PROJECT BASE THEM ON ALL OF THE SITES THAT WE ANALYZED AND THEREFORE IT WOULD BE TENANT-BASED VOUCHERS THAT WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR PEOPLE TO MOVE INTO THE SITE AND SERVE LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. IN THE TAX CREDIT PROGRAM, YOU CAN DO SOMETHING CALLED INCOME AVERAGING. AVERAGES HAS TO BE 60%. SO YOU CAN SERVE AN 80% A.M.I. HOUSE HOLD, AS LONG AS YOU SERVE A 30% A.M.I. HOUSEHOLD TO MAKE IT THE AVERAGE AT 60%. I HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH THE D.D.A. OF HOW TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE DOWNTOWN. ONE THE THINGS THEY CAN DO IS BUILD OUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE. SO UTILITIES, SIDEWALKS, LAND SCAPING AND SUCH. THAT WOULD ALSO HELP TO SAVE THE FUNDING ON THE SITES, WHEN THEY ARE IN THE DOWNTOWN. THE NEXT SITE IS 404-406 NORTH ASHLEY. THIS IS EXACTLY THE SAME SITE AND SCORES EXACTLY THE SAMEWAY AS CATHERINE AND FOURTH SITE. IT'S ELIGIBLE FOR ALL THE SAME FUNDING SOURCES. THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE IS THE SITE IS CURRENTLY OCCUPIED BY THE U OF M DENTAL CLINIC AND WE NEED TO WORK WITH THE U OF M AND DENTAL CLINIC TO RELOCATE THEIR OPERATIONS EITHER TEMPORARILY OR PERMANENTLY DEPENDING ON WHAT THEY WANT TO DO THE DENTAL CLINIC PERFORMED A NEEDED SERVICE IN THE CLIENT FOR ALL OF ITS PATIENTS THAT DO NOT HAVE DENTAL INSURANCE. I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT IS A SIGNIFICANT INCONVENIENCE AND VERY STRESSFUL TO HAVE TO RELOCATE OFFICES, WHETHER TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT OR BOTH, I HAVE LIVED THROUGH THIS MYSELF. WE RECENTLY MOVED THROUGH SOUTH INDUSTRIAL. AND MY OWN RECOMMENDATIONS, WHEN YOU GET TO SOUTH INDUSTRIAL RECOMMENDS THAT WE MOVE TWICE. SO I UNDERSTAND HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO MAKE THAT KIND OF MOVE. WE ACTUALLY HAVE A SURVEY OUT TO OUR TENANTS TO FIND OUT WHAT THEIR MOST COMMON MODE OF TRANSPORTATION IS TO GET TO OUR SITES AND WE HAVE GIVEN THEM A COUPLE OF SITES IN THIS ANALYSIS, FOR THEM TO TELL US, YOU KNOW, WHAT IS THE MOST CONVENIENT PLACE FOR THEM TO GET TO? I CANNOT DO AN ASSESSMENT FOR THE U OF M OR THE DENTAL CLINIC TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THEIR OPERATING NEEDS ARE. THEY WILL HAVE TO DO THAT ON THEIR OWN, BUT THE GOOD THING IS WE HAVE A LOT OF TIME TO DO THAT. THEY STILL HAVE A YEAR AND A HALF ON THEIR LEASE WHICH CAN BE EXTENDED AS NEEDED WHILE WE ARE WORKING THROUGH THESE ISSUES. AGAIN, IT TAKES SEVERAL YEARS TO GET FROM CONCEPT TO DEVELOPMENT. SO WE HAVE LOTS OF TIME, EVEN WHEN I SAY IT'S URGENT TO MOVE FORWARD, THAT'S FAST IN THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT WORLD. WE RECOMMEND THE HOUSING COMMISSIONER AS THE DEVELOPER FOR THIS SITE. AND SIMILAR TYPE OF TARGETING, AND IF COUNCIL WOULD LIKE THERE TO BE SUPPORTIVE SERVICES, WE CAN MAKE THAT AS HOUSING PROJECT ON EITHER SITE. SOUTH ASHLEY PARKING LOT, ALSO KNOWN TO MANY AS THE KLEIN'S LOT ALSO SCORED VERY HIGHLY FOR TAX CREDITS, HOWEVER, YOU WILL SEE THE BLUE TRIANGLES BECAUSE THE SITE IS SO LARGE, THAT IT MAXES E AMOUNT OF TAX CREDIT FUNDING THAT'S AVAILABLE. WE RAN IT WITH TWO TAX CREDIT APPLICATIONS, BUT EVEN THEN IT WOULD MAX OUT AT ABOUT 125 AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS. THEREFORE A LARGE NUMBER OF THE UNITS WOULD NEED TO BE MARK MART RATE, UNLESS THE CITY PUTS IN SUBSTANTIAL LOCAL RESOURCES. THE SIZE OF PROJECT, 400 TO 600 UNITS AND THE LOSS OF THIS PARKING LOT WOULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THIS PART OF DOWNTOWN THAT WE BELIEVE A COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT PROCESS IS NEEDED. WE ALSO RECOMMEND THAT COUNCIL CONSIDER WORKING WITH THE D.D.A. TO DESIGN A PARKING DECK ON 216 WEST WILLIAM TO CONNECT THE DEVELOPMENT TO SOUTH ASHLEY IF THAT IS FEASIBLE. YOU CAN'T SEE IT ON THIS SITE, BUT IF YOU GO TO THE LEFT, AND STRAIGHT DOWN THE HILL IS 216 WEST WILLIAM, AND THAT IS A PART OF OUR ANALYSIS THAT WE WILL BE COMING UP TO. AS YOU CAN SEE, FOR 721 NORTH MAIN, THERE ARE MANY PROBLEMS WITH THIS SITE. ESPECIALLY RELATED TO THE FLOODWAY AND THE FLOODPLAIN. PLEASE NOTE, DUE TO MY LIMITED TECHNOLOGICAL PROWESS, THE YELLOW LINE ON THE PROPERTY IS MISSING A LITTLE BIT OF THE LOT THAT IS DUE WEST. THERE'S ACTUALLY A SLIVER OF CITY-OWNED LAND TO THE -- RIGHT UP TO THE RAILROAD AS WELL. HOWEVER, THERE'S A FEMA DEED RESTRICTION PROHIBITING CONSTRUCTION ON THE BLUE PARTS OF THIS MAP WHICH IS THE FLOODWAY. AND ALTHOUGH THE CITY TECHNICALLY ALLOWS DEVELOPMENT IN THE GREEN PART OF THE MAP WHICH IS THE FLOODPLAIN, IT'S THE LIGHT BLUE ON HERE, THE LIGHTER BLUE. IT WOULD BE COUNTER TO THE CITY'S ZONING REGULATION GOALS, RELATED TO FLOOD MITIGATION HAZARDS IF YOU WERE TO DEVELOP ON THAT PART. SO THE BLUE AND GREEN AREAS ARE IDENTIFIED AS EXCELLENT LOCATIONS FOR GREENWAY OR TREE LINE TRAIL PATHS AND CITY DOCUMENTS AND IT'S ALSO RIGHT UP NEXT TO THE RAILROAD AND SO THAT MAKES IT COMPLETELY INELIGIBLE FOR ANY KIND OF FEDERAL OR H.U.D.-TYPE FUNDING. HOWEVER, THE NORTHWEST CORNER IS DEVELOPABLE AND WE BELIEVE 25 TO 35 UNITS COULD BE DEVELOPED ON THAT PART OF THE LOT. BUT DUE TO THE LIMITED FUNDING OPTIONS, WE LOOKED AT THE SITE AS POTENTIALLY EITHER A LIMITED EQUITY CO-OP OR A MIXED INCOME SITE. I DO NEED TO NOTE THAT IT'S OWNED BY A CITY PUBLIC UTILITY WHICH IS AN ENTERPRISE FUND. IT WOULD NEED TO BE MADE WHOLE THROUGH ANY TYPE OF PURCHASE. CRAIG HUPY INDICATED THAT THEY ARE SUPPORTIVE OF REPURPOSING THIS SITE. FOR ALL OF THESE REASONS WE RECOMMEND FURTHER COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND DEVELOP THE BEST DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY. THIS IS AN ODD PROPERTY. IT'S VERY LONG AND SKINNY. IT RUNS BETWEEN PLATTE ROAD AND SPRING BROOK DIRECTLY ACROSS THE STREET FROM WHERE  WE ARE ROAD.OPING OUR SITE ON PLATTE IT WAS PURCHASED FOR THE HOUSING COMMISSION WITH H.U.D. PHONES, I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY YEARS AGO, -- H.U.D. FUNDS, I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY YEARS AGO, THE LOCATION DOESN'T SCORE WELL UNDER THE CURRENT TAX CREDIT SYSTEM AND IT'S TOO SMALL TO BE FEASIBLE AS A STAND ALONE TAX CREDIT SITE WITH ONLY ABOUT 12 TO 14 UNITS. THE TAX CORRECT FINANCING IS HARD. IT'S HIGHLY REGULATED AND IT MAKES IT MORE EXPENSIVE. SO IT'S DIFFICULT TO MAKE ANY PROJECT UNDER 20 TO 25 UNITS FEASIBLE WITH TAX CREDITS, UNLESS THERE ARE A LOT OF LOCAL GRANT SOURCES. THE HOUSING COMMISSION HAS HAD DISCUSSIONS WITH HABITAT FOR HUMANITY AS A POTENTIAL DEVELOPER. WE ALSO TALKED WITH HABITAT, THE CITY'S SUSTAINABILITY DEPARTMENT, AND THE OFFICE OF COMMUNITY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND OTHER PARTNERS ABOUT PILOTING A PROGRAM TO BUILD MODULAR HOUSING, THAT IS UBER GREEN, THAT IS SOLAR, THAT IS SOLAR BATTERY SURGE AND HAS NET ZERO ENERGY USE. IT WOULD BE IDEAL FOR THIS TYPE OF PILOT PROJECT, WHETHER IT IS OWNER HOUSING OR WHETHER IT IS RENTAL HOUSING. IT DOESN'T MATTER. THE SITE HAS A LOT OF POTENTIALLY EXPENSIVE PUBLIC UTILITIES. THE EXISTING WATER MAIN MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT BASED ON THE DENSITY OF DEVELOPMENT. THERE'S ONLY A SANITARY LINE ON PLATTE, BUT THERE'S STORM ON BOTH PLATTE AND SPRING BROOK AND YOU INTO ED TO BUILD A PRIVATE ROAD. ALL -- AND YOU NEED TO BUILD A PRIVATE ROAD. ALL OF THOSE THINGS MAKE IT EXPENSIVE. THE HOUSING COMMISSION IS RECOMMENDING A CONTINUATION OF THE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT WITH THE NEIGHBORS THAT WE BEGAN SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND WE STARTED DEVELOPING THE PLATTE ROAD SITE. 1510 EAST STADIUM, WHERE FIRE STATION NUMBER TWO IS, IS VERY SIMILAR TO PLATT IT HAS MOSTLY THE SAME ISSUES OTHER THAN IT'S A DIFFERENT LOCATION. IT COULD BE ACTUALLY PAIRED WITH PLATT AS A TAX CREDIT APPLICATION TO INCREASE THE TOTAL NUMBER OF THE UNITS, BUT NEITHER SIDE SCORES VERY HIGHLY. WOULD YOU HAVE TO DO IT AS I A SUPPORT ENVIRONMENT HOUSING SITE IN ORDER TO SCORE COMPETITIVELY. IF YOU DID DO SUPPORTIVE HOUSING, RATHER THAN SPEND 150 OR $180,000 A UNIT ON DEVELOPMENT COSTS, WITH LOCAL FUNDS, THE CITY COULD SET ASIDE FUNDING FOR SUPPORTIVE SERVICES AND THEN THE PROJECT COULD COMPETE FOR TAX CREDIT FINANCING. IT WOULD NEED MUCH LESS LOCAL FUNDING ON THE DEVELOPMENT SIDE. THIS WAS NOT PART OF THE CURRENT FINANCIAL ANALYSIS, BUT WE ABSOLUTELY CAN LOOK AT THAT MODEL AS NOT A PROBLEM. THE PROPERTY CURRENTLY HOUSES THE FIRE INSPECTION STAFF, THE FIRE CHIEF'S LONG-TERM PLAN IS TO REDEVELOP IT, REDEVELOP FIRE STATION NUMBER ONE, WHICH IS DOWNTOWN AND MOVE THESE STAFF DOWNTOWN. THAT PLAN IS ALSO NOT ON A FAST TRACK. SO THERE'S TIME TO DO FURTHER ANALYSIS. IF IT'S DETERMINED THAT THE SITE SHOULD BE DEVELOPED AS AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND THE FIRE DEPARTMENT IS ALSO EXPECTED TO BE MADE WHOLE FOR THE VALUE OF THE SITE, SO THOSE FUNDS CAN BE USED AT FIRE STATION NUMBER ONE. THE HOUSING COMMISSION IS LOOKING AT THIS AS A POTENTIAL SITE FOR US TO CONSOLIDATE OUR OPERATIONS TO -- INTO ONE BUILDING. WE HAVE BOTH MAINTENANCE AND OFFICE STAFF. IF WE END UP DEVELOPING SOUTH INDUSTRIAL AS OUR SITE FOR OUR OFFICES, WE WILL HAVE TO TEMPORARILY MOVE, AND THEN WE WILL BE ABLE TO MOVE BACK. AND SO WE ARE LOOKING AT THIS AS BOTH POTENTIALLY AS A TEMPORARY SITE BECAUSE IT ALREADY HAS A LARGER GARAGE AND WE NEED A PLACE FOR DELIVERIES OR REFRIGERATORS AND SUCH. AND SO WE NEED TO ACTUALLY A PLACE FOR OUR MAINTENANCE VEHICLES. SO WHAT I'M REQUESTING IS FOR CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL TO HIRE AN ARCHITECT TO SEE WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE TO DO THIS BUILDING AND THE POTENTIAL PLACE FOR HOUSING COMMISSION STAFF, AND TO SEE IF IT'S SIGNIFICANTLY LESS EXPENSIVE THAN BUILDING AT ALL NEW AT SOUTH INDUSTRIAL. AND THAT INFORMATION WILL ENABLE THE CITY COUNCIL TO MAKE A MORE INFORMED DECISION ABOUT THE SITE, AND YOU CAN STILL -- IF WE DON'T DO -- OUR OFFICES THERE, YOU CAN STILL DO HOUSING THERE IF WE MOVE THERE TEMPORARILY. AND ANOTHER GRAY BLOB. PLEASE DON'T THINK THAT'S WHAT A BUILDING WOULD LOOK LIKE IF IT'S LOCATED HERE. THIS IS SOUTH INDUSTRIAL. IT HAS SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AS WELL. IT IS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR TAX CREDITS OR H.U.D. FUNDING. IT'S CLOSE DO A LOT OF AMENITIES LIKE PHARMACY AND A GROCERY. WE ARE REQUESTING THAT CITY COUNCIL DIRECT THE HOUSING COMMISSION HOW TO DEVELOP THIS SITE USING MORE CREATIVE HOUSING CREDITS. IT INCLUDES A FINANCIAL FEASIBILITY FOR LIMITED EQUITY CO-OPS AND IT WORKED OUT ON PAPER, BUT WE WOULD LIKE MORE TIME TO EXPLORE THE MARKING FEASIBILITY OF SUCH A SUCH A PROJECT. IT WOULD REQUIRE QUALIFIED HOMEBUYERS TO GET A MORTGAGE OF $275,000 TO $385,000 AND THEY WOULD NEED TO WANT TO LIVE AT THIS LOCATION AS A CO-OP. THE SITE COULD BE SPLIT WITH A STANDALONE HOUSING COMMISSION OFFICE AND MAINTENANCE FACILITY OR IT COULD BE INCORPORATED INTO AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECT. I ALSO WANT TO NOTE THAT THIS SITE IS ALSO OWNED BY A CITY UTILITY ENTERPRISE FUND THAT NEEDS TO BE MADE WHOLE. CRAIG HUPY MENTIONED THAT THEY ARE SUPPORTIVE OF DEVELOPING THIS SITE. THE POLICE, THE C.T.N. ALSO USE THIS SITE AND THEY WOULD ALL NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THEIR OPERATIONS WOULD RELOCATE TO AS WELL. WE ARE REPRESENTING THAT WE DO NOT BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING ON THIS SITE. IT'S ENTIRELY ON THE FLOODWAY AND THE FLOODPLAIN. THIS IS SITE -- THIS IS ASHLEY, THE LARGE LOT, ALL OF THIS ENTIRE SPACE THAT WE ARE RECOMMENDING FOR A LARGE -- IT COULD BE MULTIUSE, IT COULD BE MULTIINCOME, AND THE CITY OWNS THIS LITTLE LOT RIGHT HERE AS WELL, 340. AND SO IF THE COUNCIL IS INTERESTED, YOU CAN CLEAR PACKAGE THIS WHOLE AREA INTO ONE WAY OF DEVELOPING THAT AREA. WITH PARKING AND ALL KINDS OF USES. 1320 BALDWIN IS CURRENTLY THE SENIOR CENTER. IT'S THIS BUILDING DOWN HERE IN THE CORNER, RIGHT THERE. THIS PROPERTY IS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR DEVELOPMENT AS AFFORDABLE HOUSING BECAUSE IT IS EXTREMELY LIMITED PORTION OF THE PROPERTY THAT CAN BE DEVELOPED AND IT'S NOT UNDER UTILIZED. THERE'S SCRIVENER'S ERROR. THE MDEQ IS INCORRECT. IT'S THE MDMR HAS A RESTRICTION ON THE ENTIRE PARK, EXCEPT FOR LITERALLY THE FOOTPRINT OF THIS BUILDING. IF YOU IMAGINE THIS ENTIRE ROOM BY THE PARK, THIS IS WHAT IS COVERED BY THE DNR RESTRICTION AND IT'S AN ITTY-BITTY FOOTPRINT IN THE CORNER THAT IS NOT, AND IT'S ABOUT MAYBE TWO TO THREE FAMILY HOME SIZED LOT. IN THE SENIOR CENTER WAS NO LONGER BEING USED, IT COULD DEFINITELY BE DIVIDED UP AND BUILT WITH AFFORDABLE HOUSING, BUT IT'S A VERY SMALL FOOTPRINT. IT WOULD BE HARD TO BUILD A MIDRISE WITH HOUSING AND SENIOR CENTER ON THE BOTTOM, JUST BECAUSE IT'S SIMPLY TOO TINY. I'M ALMOST DONE.
00:43:26.088: >> 350 SOUTH 5th WHICH IS WHERE THE OLD Y LOT WAS AND 415 WEST WASHINGTON, THEY WERE PULLED OUT OF THE WRITTEN FINANCIAL FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS THAT'S ATTACHED TO THE AGENDA. AND IN ORDER TO START THE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT PROCESS SOONER, BUT I WANTED TO SHOW YOU HOW THEY FIT IN WITH THE OTHER PROPERTIES BECAUSE WE'RE STILL CONTINUING TO WORK ON THEM. SO 350 SOUTH 5th IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE SOUTH ASHLEY SITE IN THE WAY IT SCORES. THE SIZE AND THE IMPACT OF THE DOWNTOWN, THE DIFFERENCE IS REALLY THAT WE ARE TRYING TO WORK WITH THE TRIPLE A.T.A. TO PROVIDE TRANSIT SERVICES AND EXPANDING ITS FOOTPRINT. SO WE ARE WORKING WITH THEM ON THAT SITE. 415 WEST WASHINGTON IS VERY SIMILAR TO 721 NORTH MAIN. IT HAS THE SAME IDENTICAL PROBLEMS WITH THE FLOODWAY, WITH THE RAILROAD, WITH THE GREENWAY DEDICATION AND THERE'S ONLY A VERY SMALL FOOTPRINT LEFT FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT OR ANY HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. THE COMMU COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT S IS SCHEDULED AND THAT'S WHAT'S ON THIS CHART TO SHOW YOU WHEN THOSE DATES ARE. WE WELCOME PEOPLE TO LET US KNOW WHAT THEY THINK ABOUT IT. SO TO SUMMARIZE, WHAT WE ARE RECOMMENDING, WE ARE RECOMMENDING STARTING THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS RIGHT NOW FOR CATHERINE AND NORTH ASHLEY. AGAIN, IT'S THREE, FOUR, FIVE-YEAR PROCESS. WE ARE RECOMMENDING STARTING COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT FOR SOUTH ASHLEY, PLATT AND NORTH MAIN, SIMILAR TO WHAT'S OCCURRING AT WEST WASHINGTON AND SOUTH 5 5th PRIOR TO DEVELOPING THE SITES. WE ARE RECOMMENDING CONDUCTING FURTHER STUDY AT INDUSTRIAL AND EAST STADIUM TO DETERMINE THE BEST DEVELOPMENT OPTIONS PRIOR TO DEVELOPMENT, AND WE RECOMMEND NOT BUILDING HOUSING ON BALDWIN AND FIRST AND WILLIAM. ON THE CONSENT AGENDA TONIGHT, THERE ARE SIX RESOLUTIONS, GIVING SPECIFIC DIRECTION TO STAFF ON THESE SITES. IF THERE ARE RESOLUTIONS YOU WANT TO PULL OFF THE CONSENT AGENDA, IN ORDER TO HAVE MORE DETAILED DISCUSSIONS FIRST, WE ARE HAPPY TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS SO YOU CAN MAKE APRILN INFORMED DISCUSSION AND DECISION. IN ADDITION, THERE'S TWO RESOLUTION TO ADD TO A FINANCIAL FEASIBILITY, ONE IS A PUBLICLY OWNED SITE AND THE OTHER IS PRIVATELY OWNED SITE. WE CAN DEVELOP ALREADY PUBLICLY OWNED PROPERTIES AND WE CAN PURCHASE PRIVATELY OWNED PROPERTY. IT'S MORE CHALLENGING BECAUSE YOU NEED TO HAVE QUICK ACCESS TO CASH. THIS WOULD WORK IF THE CITY SET UP A PROPERTY ACQUISITION FUND, SIMILAR TO THE MILLAGE FUNDING FOR THE GREEN BELT ACQUISITION PROPERTIES. I THINK YOU WOULD WANT TO SET UP A SIMILAR KIND OF ANALYSIS IF YOU WERE DOING THAT, TO LOOK AT ISSUES LIKE ZONING AND ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS, TO DETERMINE WHICH PROPERTIES HAVE THE HIGHEST POTENTIAL FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING BEFORE YOU ACQUIRE THEM. IN CONCLUSION, THE HOUSING COMMISSION, WE GET THOUSANDS OF INQUIRIES ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING EVERY YEAR. THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE APPLY TO OUR WAIT LIST EVERY TIME WE OPEN IT, AND I'M SURE I'M NO DIFFERENT THAN THE REST OF YOU IN GETTING INQUIRIES FROM PEOPLE WOULD LIVE OR TRYING TO LIVE IN ANN ARBOR, HEARING TRAGIC STORES ABOUT PEOPLE TRYING TO STAY IN THEIR HOUSING OR STAY IN THEIR HOUSING. I'M ASKING YOU TO BE PART OF THE CITY INFRASTRUCTURE, FUNDING, BUILDING AND MAINTAINING OUR INFRASTRUCTURE, WHETHER IT'S ROADS OR PARKS OR HOUSING, IT REQUIRES THE LEADERSHIP FROM THE MAYOR, THE CITY COUNCIL, AND THE CITY ADMINISTRATION AND WE NEED THAT LEADERSHIP TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND CATALYZE OUR NEIGHBORHOOD AND THE CITY, HAVE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT WHAT EQUITY AND AFFORDABILITY LOOKS LIKE AT THE CENTER OF OUR HOUSING POLICY. THANK YOU.
00:47:07.109: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [ APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU. WE WILL NO DOUBT HAVE QUESTIONS WHEN THE VARIOUS RESOLUTIONS ARISE. WE NOW COME TO PUBLIC COMMENT RESERVE TIME. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO SPEAK TO THE COUNCIL AND THE COMMUNITY ABOUT MATTERS OF MUNICIPAL INTEREST. ONE NEEDS TO HAVE SIGNED UP IN ADVANCE BY CONTACKING OUR CITY CLERK. SPEAKERS HAVE THREE MINUTES IN WHICH TO SPEAK. SO PLEASE PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE TIME CLOCK. AS A MATTER OF COURTESY, WE MAY HAVE ONLY ONE PERSON SPEAKING AT A TIME AND FINALLY, IF YOU REQUIRE ASSISTANCE IN SPEAKING BEFORE COUNCIL TODAY, WE WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO PROVIDE IT YOU TO. OUR FIRST SPEAKER IS RITA MITCHELL.
00:48:04.533: >> HELLO, I'M RITA MITCHELL, I'M HERE TO SPEAK ABOUT 2827 PACKARD. THANK YOU FOR MOVING FORWARD WITH A DECLARATION OF A CLIMATE EMERGENCY AND THE CALL TO EFFECTIVE ACTION BY 2030. THE URGENCY IS GREAT. AND WE NEED TO WORK WITH EACH OTHER AND WITH OUR IMMEDIATE RESOURCES TO QUICKLY AND EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS WAYS TO DRAW DOWN OUR FOSSIL FUEL EMISSIONS. THAT INCLUDES WORKING WITH OUR NATURAL RESOURCES. I APPRECIATE THAT THE PROPOSALS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT WILL BE DISCUSSED TONIGHT INCLUDE STANDARD DEFIN DEFINITIONS OF AD SO THAT ALL UNDERSTAND WHAT IS NEEDED. I SUGGEST THAT THE ACTUAL DOLLARS OF AN ANNUAL INCOME BE STATED RATHER THAN PERCENTAGES. TO BEST SUPPORT THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE INCOME CATEGORIES, WITH RESPECT TO 2857 PACKARD, THE PROPERTY WAS INITIALLY RECOGNIZED FOR ITS NATURAL FEATURES. TO THE EXTENT THAT CITY OF FORESTRY STAFF RECOMMENDED DENIAL OF THE ORIGINAL DEVELOPMENT PROPOSAL. THE REASON WAS SPECIFIC TO THE NUMBER OF QUALITY AND AGE OF THE EXISTING TREATS. THE NEARLY 8-ACRE PARCEL IS LARGE WITH 51 HERITAGE TREES IN A SINGLE STAND. HERITAGE TREES AND THEIR SURROUNDING MATURE TREES ARE IRREPLACEABLE WITHIN OVER TWO LIFETIMES, OUR LIFETIMES. MATURE ECOSYSTEMS, THEY FUNCTION IN A MATURE ECOSYSTEM THAT PROVIDES THE GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE BENEFITS OF FILTERING WATER AND AIR, SHADING AND COOLING, HABITAT FOR WILDLIFE, CARBON SEQUESTRATION AND PROTECTION OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD FROM SIGNIFICANT FLOODING. LARGE TREES PROVIDE THE MOST CARBON SEQUESTRATION PER YEAR. THEY ALSO PROVIDE SHADE, FILTERING OF AIR AND WATER AND HABITAT. COMPARABLE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES FROM TREES THAT WE PLANT TODAY WILL TAKE WELL OVER 40 YEARS TO DEVELOP, TO BE EFFECTIVE, AND WE ARE WORKING ON A TEN-YEAR TIME -- CLIMATE TIME LINE. ADDINGIMPERVIOUS SURFACES TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD, INCLUDING STREETS, WALKWAYS AND ROOFS WILL MEAN THE RUNOFF IN THAT AREA THAT IS AT RISK IN IN THIS MALLLETS CREEK AREA. MITIGATION OF RUNOFF WILL LACK THE QUALITY CURRENTLY PROVIDED. THE COST OF INSTALLING MANMADE INFRASTRUCTURE WILL REQUIRE MAINTENANCE. IT WILL BE INSTALLED FOR ANY NEW HOUSING. TREES ON THE OTHER HAND PROVIDE THE WIDE RANGE OF SERVICES THAT I DESCRIBED. HIGHEST AND BEST USE. IS A TERM THAT I UNDERSTAND TO MEAN THE BIGGEST GAIN FOR DEVELOPER WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE EXIST AS PARTS OF AN ECOSYSTEM, AND THAT FOR OUR COLLECTIVE PURPOSES, IT WILL BE BEST TO PLACE HOUSING IN AREAS THAT DO NOT CHALLENGE E FUNCTIONING GREEN ECOSYSTEMS. WE SHOULD LOOK AT EXISTING BUILT INFRASTRUCTURE FIRST, BEFORE WE AFURTHER DEGRADATION OF OUR ENVIRONMENT. I ASK YOU TO VOTE NO ON THE CONSENT AGREEMENT AND TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH LANDOWNER TO FIND A SOLUTION THAT WILL ALLOW RETAINING IMPORTANT ELEMENTS OF GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE. THANK YOU.
00:51:20.562: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS JAMES D 'AMOUR.
00:51:31.339: >> A MONTH AGO, I WAS HERE BEFORE YOU TALKING ABOUT THIS VERY SAME ISSUE. AND I STILL EVEN HAVE MY NOTES FROM THE PREVIOUS PRESENTATION I MADE BEFORE YOU. I'M SORRY THAT WE'RE BACK HERE. I THINK A PUD IS TOO IMPORTANT TO BE MADE OUTSIDE OF THE POLICYMAKERS, I.E., YOU HERE. I KNOW YOU ARE BEING FORCED TO HAVE THIS COME BACK TO YOU. BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED TOO MUCH BEHIND THE SCENES. I FEEL LIKE THE BLACKMAIL THREAT IS BEING PULLED HERE AND I DON'T SAY THAT TERM LIGHTLY. YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE TO BE FORCED TO COME BACK UNDER THE -- ESSENTIALLY UNDER A GUN AND THAT GUN IS BEING THE CUT DOWN OF THE HIGH-QUALITY WOODLANDS, THAT THIS PROJECT WAS DENIED ON FOR FOR THE FIRST PLACE. THIS IS A TERRIBLE WAY TO DO BUSINESS. AND WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO MR. POSTEMA, I THINK YOU NEED TO FIGHT HARDER. WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF THE PUD? I THINK THAT -- LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT IS BEING PROPOSED, WHICH IS THE VERY SAME ONE THAT WE LOOKED AT LAST MONTH. THERE'S NO AFFORDABLE HOUSING SUGGESTED FOR THE SITE THIS IS MARKET VALUE CONDOS RUNNING FOR 300 TO 400K. AS DISCUSSED BY THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER, MITIGATION IS LIKELY INSUFFICIENT, BOTH FOR CURRENT NEIGHBORS AS WELL AS FOR FUTURE RESIDENTS IN TERMS OF THE WATER ISSUES AND PARTICULARLY THE BASEMENTS ARE BEING CONSTRUCTED AND WHAT EFFECT WILL IT HAVE WITH THE TREES BEING REMOVED ON THE CURRENT RESIDENTS NEIGHBORING? SOME ACTIVISTS I HAVE TALKED TO COMMUNITY FORUMS ABOUT TRANSIT AND HOW IT'S NEAR TO THE NUMBER FIVE LINE. SURE. LOOK AT ALL THE GARAGES BEING CONSTRUCTED. THIS IS AUTO OR ENTERED AS WELL. WHAT IS THE BENEFIT HERE? WE TALKED ABOUT UBER GREEN HOUSING A MOMENT AGO, ALSO NEARBY PLATT AND SPRING BROOK. SUCH A BENEFIT, IF YOU ARE GOING TO PUT THAT IN, NEEDS TO BE -- IF YOU VOTE FOR A PUD SHOULD BE USEFUL HERE AND THERE'S NO UBER GREEN BEING DISCUSSED HERE. WHY ARE WE DOING THIS? YOU ALL NEED TO FIGHT. YOU NEED TO FIGHT HARDER FOR THIS COMMUNITY. AND SOMETIMES IT MEANS NO SAYING TO A BAD PROJECT AND BEING EITHER WE LOSE IT ALL AT ONCE OR LOSE IT GRADUALLY BY THIS PUD WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY WHAT IT'S CALLED FOR. WE ARE DAMNED IF WE DO AND DAMNED IF WE DON'T. FIGHT FOR THE TREES BEING FIGHT FOR THE CREEK AND FIGHT FOR THE CITY AND THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT'S BEING DISCUSSED IN DC-4. WE CAN DO THIS. YOU REALLY NEED TO SET THE RESOLVE FOR THE COMMUNITY. YOU NEED TO WORK A LOT HARDER THAN WHAT YOU HISTORICALLY HAVE DONE. LET'S DO SO TONIGHT. AND SOMETIMES IT MEANS SAYING THE RIGHT THING, YOU DON'T LIKE IT, SUE US! IT'S BETTER THAT THAN OTHER LONG-TERM PROBLEMS. THANK YOU FOR CONSIDERING MY COMMENTS.
00:54:35.590: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS MICHELE HUGHES.
00:54:46.901: >> SO IN ANN ARBOR, WE HAVE AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS. PEOPLE ARE MARCHING IN THE STREETS ABOUT IT. YESTERDAY ALMOST 200 PEOPLE ATTENDED THE MARCH FOR HOUSING NOW. TONIGHT, CITY COUNCIL HAS AN INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE A SIGNIFICANT STEP TOWARDS ALLEVIATING THAT CRISIS. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS VOTE YES ON CA-10 THROUGH CA-16, PARTICULARLY GOOD OPPORTUNITY, IS CA-10, TO DEVELOP AFFORDABLE HOUSING ON TWO-OWNED LOTS AND I RECOMMEND VOTING YES TONIGHT. THAT WOULD BE A GREAT STEP TOWARDS PROVIDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING NOW AS DEMANDED BY THE MARCHERS. I SUSPECT THAT SOME OF THE CITY COUNCILMEMBERS MIGHT WANT TO DELAY THIS TO TAKE TIME TO CREDIT IMPACTS AND PRIORITIES, THAT'S NOT A BAD INSTINCT. WHAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO DO IS GET YOUR BEST PEOPLE ON, THIS AND GIVE THEM ABOUT EIGHT MONTHS TO WORK OUT A DETAILED RECOMMENDATION PRIORITIZING CITY-OWNED PROPERTY FOR DEVELOPMENT. OH, WAIT A MINUTE! YOU GUYS ALREADY DID THAT. AND THEY TOOK EIGHT MONTHS, AND CA-10 IS THE RECOMMENDATION TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WITH THE BEST PEOPLE PUTTING THE BETTER PART OF A YEAR ON THIS PROJECT, WOULD BE LEFT TO DELIBERATE. CERTAINLY IT COULDN'T BE THAT SOME OF YOU WANT TO TAKE MORE TIME NOT TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND TAKING EVERY POSSIBLE ACTION TO APPEAR SHORT OF SUPPORTING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THERE'S ALWAYS SOME EXCUSE. ANY CHANGE THAT WOULD DEVELOP AFFORDABLE HOUSING GETS A GREAT DEAL OF SCRUTINY, BUT WE SHOULD BE GIVING OUR SCRUTINY TO THE STATUS THERE ARE 4,000 PEOPLE ON WAIT LIST FROM THE ANN ARBOR HOUSING COMMISSION. THAT'S 4,000 PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING HOUSING INSECURITY WHILE WE SIT AROUND AND WORRY ABOUT WHETHER IT'S CONVENIENT TO PARK AT CATHERINE AND FOURTH. PLEASE CONSIDER THE DANGERS OF STAYING THE SAME AND VOTE YES TO CA-10. [ APPLAUSE ]
00:56:57.332: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS DAN MICHNIEWICZ INTO I'M DAN, AND I'M FROM WARD 5 I'M HERE TO ASK YOU TO SUPPORT CA-10 AND 11, BECAUSE THESE ITEMS REPRESENT A PRETTY DIRECT PATH TOWARDS BUILDING HO HOUSING ON CITY-OWND LANDS. YESTERDAY AS MICHELE SAID, WE GATHERED TO MARCH FOR HOUSING NOW. OUR POINT OF UNITY WAS FOR THE CITY AND THE UNIVERSITY TO BUILD HOUSING ON PUBLIC LAND BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE THAT IT'S A HOUSING CRISIS AND SPECIFICALLY A CRISIS FOR THE HOUSING INSECURE AND IT'S A TENANTS CRISIS. FOR TENANTS RENTS KEEP GOING UP, WHILE WAGES STAY ABOUT THE SAME. I STARTED COOKING IN KITCHENS ABOUT NINE YEARS AGO IN ANN ARBOR AT $10 AN HOUR. I GOT A JOB -- MY CURRENT JOB LAST YEAR AT -- STARTING AT $12.50 AND I'M NOT A SLOUCH IN KITCHENS. PEOPLE WILL TELL YOU THAT, I GUESS. AND THAT'S JUST BARELY KEEPING UP WITH INFLATION. SO WE ARE FORCED TO LIVE FURTHER AWAY FROM WHERE WE ARE WORK AND AS A RESULT, WE ARE COMMUTING IN, MOSTLY WE DRIVE IN. AND THAT PRACTICE CONTRIBUTES TO THE FRACTURING OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND THE STRUCTURE OF THIS ENVIRONMENT. SO YESTERDAY WE PARTICIPATED IN THE SYMBOLIC STRUGGLE. WE SLOGANEERED AND WE MARCHED AND WE SANG BUT WE SPOKE WITH ONE VOICE. AND WITH THAT VOICE, WE THINK THAT HOUSING IS A HUMAN RIGHT AND THAT WE SHOULD BE CRAFTING POLICY TO TURN THAT ASSERTION OF OUR VALUE INTO, YOU KNOW, A REALITY, WHERE PEOPLE'S RIGHT TO HAVE A ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD IS NOT DEPENDENT ON THEIR ABILITY TO, YOU KNOW, PRODUCE A VALUE -- PRODUCE A PROFIT AT A WAGE JOB. PA ARE BAR HERE IN THIS ROOM,HEA SYMBOLIC STRUGGLE. IT'S ACTING OPEN BUILDING SOCIAL HOUSING ON THE PROPERTY THAT WE ALREADY OWN AND THERE'S A PRETTY CLEAR PATH FOR THIS. IT'S IN CA-10 AND CA-11, AND IT'S A PARTICULARLY GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR US, BECAUSE WE DON'T EVEN HAVE TO ADDRESS THIS DISCUSSION THAT IS KIND OF DIVIDING THE COMMUNITY ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THE PRIVATE SECTOR PLAYS A ROLE IN ADDRESSING OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS, THIS TENANTS CRISIS. WE DON'T HAVE TO DISCUSS TONIGHT IN CA-10 AND CA-11 SPECIFICALLY, WHETHER OR NOT, YOU KNOW, PRIVATE DEVELOPERS SHOULD GET A SHARE OF PUBLIC LAND IN ORDER FOR US TO GET SOME KIND OF, YOU KNOW, CONCESSIONS IN TERMS OF CAPS ON CERTAIN AMOUNT OF UNITS OR CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUND. THIS IS WHAT THOSE PEOPLE MARCHING YESTERDAY WERE TALKING ABOUT, SOCIAL HOUSING, DIRECT INVESTMENT IN,IKE, A -- A SOCIAL GOOD HOUSING THAT WE SHOULD BE TREATING AS SUCH. THANK YOU.
01:00:07.689: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. HOUR NEXT SPEAKER IS ERICA BRIGGS.
01:00:15.196: >> GOOD EVENING, I'M ERICA BRIGGS. I'M RUNNING FOR CITY COUNCIL IN THE 5th WARD. I WOULD LIKE TO CONGRATULATE YOU ON ADOPTING THE RESOLUTION AT YOUR LAST MEETING ON ANN ARBOR BEING CARBON NEUTRAL BY 2030. WE WILL NEED TO BUILD A MORE ROBUST TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM THAT ENCO ENCOURAGES AND ENABLES PEOPLE TO GET AROUND TOWN WITHOUT A CAR. TONIGHT, YOU WILL HAVE MANY OPPORTUNITIES TO DEMONSTRATE YOUR COMMITMENT TO THIS GOAL. AS WE JUST HEARD FROM MS. HALL'S PRESENTATION, THERE ARE A NUMBER THE OPPORTUNITIES TO PURSUE AFFORDABLE HOUSING ON CITY-OWNED PROPERTY. CLEARLY SUPPORTING THESE PROJECTS WILL HELP US ADDRESS OUR HOUSING AFFORDABILITY IS BUT ADDING AFFORDABILITY HOUSING REDUCES COMMUTES AND LIVE CLOSER TO THEIR JOBS WHICH ADDRESSES THE CLIMATE CRISIS. I ENCOURAGE YOU TO SUPPORT THE NUMEROUS RESOLUTIONS TO ADVANCE THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING ON THE CONSENT AGENDA. I ENCOURAGE YOU TO SUPPORT CA-19, THE PROPOSAL TO REMOVE ON-STREET HOUSING ON BARTON DRIVE AND ADD BIKE LANES. I LIVE IN THE FIFTH WARD AND I LIVE A COUPLE OF BLOCKS AWAY FROM THIS PROJECT A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO AND I HAVE A NUMBER OF FRIENDS WOULD STILL LIVE THERE. SO YOU HEARD A NUMBER OF ISSUES RAISED AT LAST NIGHT'S COUNCIL CAUCUS. THERE WERE SOME RESIDENTS WOULD SAID WE ARE REMOVING PARKING AND PUTTING IN BIKE LANES, GIVING PEOPLE A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY THIS PROJECT IS IMPORTANT TO THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE. IT WAS INCLUDED IN THE CITY'S NON-MOTORIZED PLAN AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO INCREASE CONNECTIVITY, COMFORT AND SAFETY FOR CYCLISTS. SOME OF THE CYCLISTS UTILIZE BARTON DRIVE TO GET TO WORK BUT MANY USE THIS CORRIDOR FOR RECREATION ALE PURPOSES. THAT'S PROBABLY WHY IT RECEIVED 75% SUPPORT IN THE ONLINE SURVEY. AND IT RECEIVES MAJORITY SUPPORT FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD MEETING SURVEY, EVEN THOUGH THE PROJECT WOULD RESULT IN THE LOSS OF PARKING. YES, I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE WERE CONCERNS THAT SURVEY RESULTS FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD MEETING WERE NOT VALID FOR A FEW REASONS BUT I THERE'S NO REASON TO THINK THAT STAFF WAS NOT WORKING HARD TO COLLECT NEIGHBORHOOD FEEDBACK ACCURATELY THIS MEETING. OVERALL THE COMMUNITY SURVEYS SHOW PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR THIS PROJECT. THE ENGINEERING ANALYSIS, SUPPORTED THIS PROJECT, AND THIS PROJECT WAS INCLUDED IN THE NON-MOTORIZED PLAN FOR GOOD REASON. THIS IS A DANGEROUS CORRIDOR WITH DRIVERS EXITING AND ENTERING M-14. PEOPLE ALREADY BIKE ALONG THIS CORRIDOR. PEOPLE ARE ALREADY RIDING THERE. CREATING BIKE LANES IS NOT DANGEROUS BUT ASKING BIKERS TO TAKE THE LANE AND SLOW DOWN AGGRESSIVE DRIVERS IS. ARE ALL BIKERS GOING TO BE COMFORTABLE BIKING ON BARTON DRIVE? NO, OF COURSE NOT. BUT THIS MAKES IT SAFER. IF WE WANT TO REACH OUR GOAL BY BECOMING CARBON NEUTRAL BY 2030, THEN YOU MUST DEVELOP BETTER BICYCLE FACILITIES. THANK YOU.
01:03:17.545: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS ELLEN ROWE.
01:03:30.191: >> GOOD EVENING, I'M ELLEN ROWE, A RESIDENT OF WARD ONE, AND I'M A PROFESSOR AT THE MUSIC OF COLLEGE AT U OF M. I'M HERE TO SPEAK ABOUT THE DEER CULL. CULL ADVOCATES HAVE HAD THEIR WAY FOR FOUR YEARS AT AN EXPENSIVE CLOSE TO $600,000 AND HAVE ALREADY KILLED 387 DEER AND STERILIZED 75 MORE. AFTER THE FOUR-YEAR PROGRAM, CITY COUNCIL WAS TO REASSESS THE DEER MANAGEMENT PROGRAM AND REVIEW METRICS PRIOR TO AUTHORIZING ANY MORE FUNDING WH MY UNDERSTANDING HAS NOT HAPPENED IN A MEANINGFUL WAY. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. NOW IS THE TIME TO ALLOW THE CITY TO RECOVER FROM THE EFFECTS OF GUN E VIOLENCE IN OUR PARKS D NEIGHBORHOODS AND ASSESS WHERE THE DEER PROGRAM HAS LET US. SOMEONE FROM WC4EB DESCRIBES THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO BE USED AS A DROP IN THE BUCKET, PERHAP FOR WELL OFF LANDOWNERS THAT IS THE CASE. BUT THAT IS A LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY AND WE CAN VISUALIZE USING IT TO CONTINUE TO FIGHT CLIMB A CHANGE, OR SUPPORT SCHOOL BUDGETS. BEYOND ISSUES OF LANDSCAPE DAMAGE, ONE ISSUE THAT HAS DRIVEN THE DEBATE, DEER-VEHICLE COLLISIONS. THERE ARE OTHER MEASURES THAT CAN AND SHOULD BE TAKEN TO HELP PREVENT CRASHES. A RECENT PROGRAM IN CENTRAL WYOMING REDUCED COLLISIONS BY 32% THROUGH THE PLACEMENT OF REFLECTIVE MARKERS ALONG THE SIDES OF HIGHWAYS. THE DVB STUDY ED SHOWS THAT AREAS OF HIGHWAYS WITH 55-MILE-PER-HOUR SPEED LIMIT HAD 36% FEWER COLLISIONS THAN THOSE MARKED AT 65, AND 55% FEWER COLLISIONS WHEN THE SPEED LIMIT WAS 75. HOW ABOUT WE REDUCE THE SPEED LIMIT ON CERTAIN STRETCHES OF HIGHWAYS WITH HIGHER DVBs TO 55, AND THAT WOULD COST ALMOST NOTHING. I BELIEVE THAT I REPRESENT A GREAT NUMBER OF ANN ARBOR RESIDENTS WHO DO NOT BELIEF THAT WILDLIFE IS AISPOSABLE COMMODITY. HOW ABOUT IN THE NEXT FEW WE ENGAGE IN A PROCESS WHERE WE STUDY DATA COLLECTED OVER TIME, AND ASSESS THE POPULATION CHANGES WITHOUT A CULL, AND ALLOW FOR EXPERTS TO COME UP WITH MORE HUMANE MANAGEMENT PROTOCOLS. FOR BETTER OR WORSE, AND USUALLY WORSE, WE ARE THE STEWARDS OF THIS PLANET. FROM THE POLLUTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT, AND OVER POPULATION OF THE URBAN AREAS. HUMAN BEINGS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE THAT'S ALLOWED THE DEER POPULATION TO THRIVE, FROM THE EARLY ELIMINATION OF PREDATORS TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF FORMER H HABITAT AND THE INCREASING NUMBER OF CARS ON THE ROAD. WE SHOULD FEEL THE RESPONSIBILITY OF LONG-TERM RESPONSIBILITY THAT RESPECT THE RIGHTS OF ALL. THIS ATTITUDE IS PREVALENT IN MORE AND MORE PARTS OF THE COUNTRY AND LEADING TO IMMINENT ECOLOGICAL CATASTROPHE. I BEG YOU NOT TO GO FORWARD WITH MORE CULLS AT THIS POINT IN TIME BUT TO STEP BACK AND RECOGNIZE THAT YOU HAVE ALREADY MET THE ORIGINAL GOALS OF 450 DEER KILLED OR STERILIZED AND IF THERE IS NOT A BETTER USE OF OUR TAXPAYER MONEY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
01:06:32.640: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS CHRISTOPHER. DICK.
01:06:46.153: >> I'M A PROFESSOR OF ECOLOGY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN. AND I'M HERE TO SUPPORT THE CONTINUED FUNDING OF DEER MANAGEMENT. I LEARNED ABOUT DEER MANAGEMENT FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN GEORGE RESERVE LOCATED INVINGST. FOR BACKGROUND, IN THE 1920s, SIX DEER WERE RELEASED INTO THE FENCED IN FOREST. THE POPULATION GREW TO MORE THAN 160 DEER IN JUST SIX YEARS. THIS CAUSED HEAVY BROWSING PRESSURE AND SUPPRESSED FOREST REGENERATION. SINCE 1942, THE UNIVERSITY HAS MANAGED THE HERD, INCLUDING USING CULL. THIS HAS LED TO A FULL RECOVERY OF THE FORESTS. FULL RECOVERY OF WILDLIFE AND SMALL ANIMALS OTHER THAN DEER. IN THE EARLY 2000s,  U.M. Ph.D. STUDENT CARRIED OUT A STUDY AND SHE PRESENTED THE RESRESULTS OF HER STUDY HERE INN ARBOR. THE DR. CORTEZ SHOWS THAT BROWSING PRESSURE BY DEER IS INTENSE ENOUGH TO PREVENT FOREST REGENERATION IN MOST OF THE AREAS HE IS STUDIED. ANOTHER ISSUE IS HOW COLLECT THE DEER ARE WHEN THEY BROWSE. THEY ARE NOT JUST EATING ANY LEAVES, THEY ARE ACTUALLY FOCUSING ON FLOWER BUDS, LEAF BUDS AND THE MOST TENDER LEAVES AND THESE ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT PLANTS FOR REGENERATION AND POLL ENATORS. I -- POLLINATORS. I HAVE SEEN CRITICISM ABOUT THE COST OF REMOVING THE SMALL NUMBER OF DEER. REMOVING OR STERILIZING DEER ELIMINATES THEIR EXPONENTIAL REPRODUCTIVE POTENTIAL. USING DEMOGRAPHIC MODELS PROFESSOR PETER HONEYMAN OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN ESTIMATES THAT ANN ARBOR WOULD HAVE MORE THAN 1,000 ADDITIONAL DEER TODAY, WERE IT NOT FOR THE DEER MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. THEY DON'T CONSIDER THE DEER THAT HAVE BEEN CULLED BUT CONSIDER THOSE PREVENTED FROM COMING ALONG. TO GET AN IDEA OF WHAT IT MEANS TO REDUCE ANN ARBOR'S DEER HERD BY 1,000 DEER, CONSIDER THAT A SINGLE DEER CONSUMES 1.5 TIMES OF PLANT MATERIAL EACH YEAR. MULTIPLIED BY 1,000 DEER, THAT IS OVER 1500 TONS OF FLOWERS, BUDS AND TENDER LEAVES THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE AVAILABLE TO NATIVE POLLINATORS AND BIRDS AND PLANT REGENERATION JUST IN ONE YEAR. SO THAT'S 3 MILLION POUNDS. BY ALLOWING OUR FOREST TO REGENERATE, WE ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO HUMAN WELL-BEING AND CARBON SEQUESTRATION. SO FROM ECOLOGICAL, PUBLIC HEALTH, SAFETY, AND CLIMATE MITIGATION PERSPECTIVES THE DEER MANAGEMENT PROGRAM IN MY OPINION IS A SUCCESS AND WELL WORTH THE SUSTAINED FUNDING. THANK YOU.
01:09:31.352: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS SARAH BYERS.
01:09:42.730: >> HI, MY NAME IS SARAH BYERS, I LIVE IN THE FIRST WARD. THERE IS A SAYING, SAFETY DOESN'T HAPPEN BY ACCIDENT. PLEASE STOP RISKING OUR SAFETY BY BRINGING HIGH-POWERED WEAPONS INTO OUR CITY TO KILL DEER UNNECESSARILY. FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS, SEVERAL GROUPS, INCLUDING THE HUMANE SOCIETY OF HURON VALLEY, HAVE BEEN ACTIVELY TRYING TO GET THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR TO WORK WITH ITS CITIZENS TO LIVE PEACEFULLY WITH ALL OF OUR NATIVE ANIMALS BEING DISPLACED BY LARGE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS SPROUTING UP AROUND THE PERIMETER OF ANN ARBOR, THE DEER BEING THE MOST VISIBLE. A FOUR-YEAR TIME FRAME WAS TO BE THE LIMIT AND DURING THOSE YEARS ANTI-CULL ADVOCATES MARCHES, VIA COUNCIL MEETINGS AND MONITORING THE PARK FOR DEER BAITERS AND ACTIVE SHOOTERS. THIS SUMMER IT WAS NOTED AS BEING THE MOST WELL-EDUCATED CITY IN AMERICA. I FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE WITH THESETHESE ATTRIBUTES THAT THERO WAY FOR PEOPLE TO WORK TOGETHER, AND PLANT TREES AND SHRUBBERY THAT ARE NOT AS APPEALING TO THE DEER AND LIVE WITH OUR ANIMAL NEIGHBORS IN A PEACEFUL MANNER. THIS IS HOPEFULLY WITHOUT INSTILLING FEAR INTO THOSE WHO ACCUSTOMED TO WALKING OUR PET AND JOG IN THE CITY PARKS. EVEN NOTE THE PARKS COLORED AND WE ARE ASSURED THAT THE SHARP SHOOTERS SITTING IN HAMMOCKS HUNG BETWEEN TREES IN OUR PARKS, AND ON OUR UNIVERSITY'S CAMPUS, KNOW THAT THEY ARE -- KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING AND WELL TRAINED THERE COULD BE ONE WHO COULD MAKE A MISTAKE AND SHOOT A RIFLE NEAR A HOME AND KILL OR SERIOUSLY INJURY SOMEONE OR A BELOVED BET. EACH YEAR DURING THE KILLING SEASON, THERE PEACE NUMEROUS VIOLATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN CITED AND REPORTED TO THE CITY AND THE POLICE. THESE HAVE BEEN MENTIONED IN PAST COUNCIL MEETINGS AND BY THE PRESS. THERE HAVE BEEN SIGNS EASY TO MISS, DUE TO THE FAIRLY SMALL SIZE OF THE SIGN, AND SIMILARITY TO OTHER POSTED SIGNS AND THERE WERE SOME THAT HAD ACTUALLY BLOWN DOWN, NOT TO MENTION THE MYRIAD OF WAYS TO END ALL OF OUR PARKS OTHER THAN THE MAIN ENTRANCES. DURING OUR PARKS AND NEIGHBORHOODS INTO KILLING FIELDS IS NOT THE WILL OF THE MAJORY IT OF THE PEOPLE AND IS NOT SAFE EVER. THE CITY ELIMINATED THE 450-FOOT RULE THAT WAS IN EFFECT FOR SEVERAL YEARS BECAUSE IT SERVED A USEFUL PURPOSE AND PROTECTING US. WITHOUT IT, THERE'S MORE INHERENT DANGER IN DISCHARGING POWERFUL FIREARMS WITH PEOPLE AND PETS NEARBY. COULD WE AT LEAST DECLARE A UM AND SEE IF THIS IS WORKING AT ALL, AND MEANWHILE, WORK ON BEING A MODEL CITY THAT WE ARE ALL PROUD TO LIVE IF BY COMING UP WITH ALTERNATIVES TO CULLING WILDLIFE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION AND LET'S TAX OUR TAX DOLLARS AND SAVE OUR DEER.
01:12:45.846: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS KURT SONEN.
01:12:56.089: >> HI, I'M KURT SONEN, FROM WARD TWO. AND I WANT TO THANK COUNCIL AND STAFF FOR PUSHING FORWARD WITH DEER MANAGEMENT. DESPITE THE AND MIRRORS AND MISINFORMATION THAT'S PUT FORTH, THE LONG-TERM METRICS WERE PUT FORTH TO ESTABLISH THE PROGRAM. THERE IS WORK TO GO DONE. WE HAVE NOT ATTAINED THE CITY STATED GOAL FOR THE NATURAL AREAS WHICH IS REDUCE DEER BROWSE AREAS TO A SUSTAINABLE RANGE. DR. CORTEZ'S STUDIES DOCUMENT THAT THIS METRIC IS CLEARLY NOT BEING ATTAINED. BROWSE LEVELS OAKS NEED TO BE BELOW 15% RANGE AND THEY WERE GREAT THAN 50% AT 12 OF THE 16 SITES. I WILL CLEARLY SAY THAT I HAVE HOPE, THOUGH. I'M IN AN AREA THAT HAS BOTH LETHAL AND NONLETHAL DEER MANAGEMENT. AND I HAVE PERSONALLY WITNESSED THAT THINGS ARE GETTING BETTER IN ANY AREA. WE WERE AT 100 DEER PER SQUARE MILE BEFORE. THE VEGETATION WAS DEVOURED EVERYWHERE. NOT MUCH WAS LEFT, UNLESS IT HAD A CAGE AROUND IT. THAT INCLUDES INVASIVES. I WAS CUTTING DOWN HONEYSUCKLES AND WHILE PILING IT UP, THE DEER WERE EATING IT WHILE I WAS STANDING THERE. NOW A LOT LESS DEER PASS THROUGH AND SINCE THE LOCAL DEER ARE STERILIZED THEY ARE NOT EATING TO FEED BABIES AND FAWNS. SO THERE'S A LOT LET PREDATION. PLANTS. THIS IS FIRST YEAR I HAVE EVER SEEN SPECIES BLOOM WITHOUT CAGES AROUND THEM. I HAVE PLACES I NEVER EVEN KNEW EXISTED BEFORE IT NEVER COULD FLOWER BEFORE. I STILL HAVE TO PROTECT ALL THE OAKS IF I WANT THEM TO GROW, BUT I SEE A LOT LESS BROWSE DAMAGE. THIS FOREST REGENERATION TIES BACK TO THE CLIMATE GOAL CHANGES. THAT'S YOUR -- YOUR FORESTS ARE SEQUESTERING YOUR CARBON. SO THESE ARE TOTALLY INTRICATE AND INTERTWINED. PLEASE EXTENT DEER MANAGEMENT TO WARDS 3, 4 AND 5, AND SMALL POPULATIONS HAVE PROVEN AGAIN AND AGAIN TO BECOME LARGE POPULATIONS WITHOUT INTERVENTION. THIS NEEDS TO BE A CITY-WIDE PROGRAM AS IT WAS ORIGINALLY INTENDED. THE COSTS WILL GO DOWN AS WE GET TO MAINTENANCE LEVEL, BUT WE ARE NOT THERE YET.
01:15:10.490: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
01:15:11.224: >> THANK YOU.
01:15:12.492: >> Mayor Taylor: OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS ED SAUNDERS.
01:15:19.099: >> HELLO. MY NAME IS ED SAUNDERS. I'M AT 433 HILLDALE DRIVE HERE IN WARD ONE IN ANN ARBOR. I HEEM TONIGHT TO URGE YOU TO ENTHUSIASTICALLY SUPPORT RESOLUTION NUMBER 19-2106 TO DEVELOP A PLAN TO EXPAND THE ACCESS TO VOTING AND REGISTRATION. IT'S SELF-OF THAT VOTING IS FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR DEMOCRACY AND THEREFORE ELECTED OFFICIALS AT ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT SHOULD CONSIDER ANY ACTION THAT SUPPORTS VOTER PARTICIPATION TO BE AMONG THEIR MOST BASIC AND IMPORTANT RESPONSIBILITIES. I'M A LIFELONG SUPPORTER OF ALL EFFORTS TO INCREASE ACCESS TO VOTING TO PROMOTE AND EDUCATE AN ELECTORATE. IN 2017, I BECAME AN ACTIVE VOLUNTEER WITH VOTERS NOT POLITICIANS TO HELP VOTERS ACHIEVE THESE GOALS. IN 2018, MICHIGAN VOTERS ENTHUSIASTICALLY ENDORSED SEVERAL VOTING IMPROVEMENTS BY PASSING PROPOSITION 2, PROPOSAL 2, RATHER AND PROPOSAL 3, BY WIDE MARGINS ACROSS THE STATE. PROPOSAL THREE BROUGHT GATE ACCESS, INCLUDING NO RECENT ABSENTEE VOTING AND EXTENDED REGISTRATION PERIODS RIGHT UP THROUGH ELECTION DAY. CITIZENSCAN GO DIRECTLY TO THE CLERK'S OFFICE TO REGISTER AND GET AN ABSENTEE BALLOT AND MAIL IT BACK IN OR VOTE THERE ON THE SPOT. THE MANY PEOPLE WORK DURING THE REGULAR CLERK'S OFFICE HOURS. RESOLUTION 2106 REQUESTS THAT THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR DEVELOP A PLAN FOR LATER APPROVAL BY COUNCIL, TO BETTER SUPPORT PROPOSAL THREE'S NEW VOTING ACCESS IMPROVEMENTS. SPECIFICALLY, IT INCLUDES INCREASES VOTING REGISTRATION ACCESS, OFFERS A SATELLITE LOCATION FOR REGISTRATION AND ABSENTEE BALLOTING AND PROVIDES BROAD PUBLICITY FOR THESE IMPROVEMENTS. BY PASSING RESOLUTION 2106, ANN ARBOR WILL MAKE VOTING MORE ACCESSIBLE, ESPECIALLY FOR YOUNG VOTERS, NEW VOTERS AND WORKING PEOPLE. I URGE YOUR ENTHUSIASTIC SUPPORT OF COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN'S 19-2106.
01:17:45.178: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. ARE THERE COMMUNICATIONS FROM COUNCIL? COUNCILMEMBER, HAYNER?
01:17:48.715: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES, THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. JUST A FEW QUICK THINGS. MOST PEOPLE WHO ARE TUNED INTO THIS PROBABLY KNOW ABOUT THIS ALREADY. I'M HAPPY TO REPORT THAT THE SOLAR -- THE BUILD ACT WAIVES THE TAXES ON SOLAR PANELS. WE DID HAVE A LOT OF ADVOCATING FOR THAT, AND SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT BEING ADDED TO OUR TOOLKIT TO HELP ENCOURAGE RESIDENTS TO REDUCE THEIR CARBON FOOTPRINT HERE IN THE CITY. SECONDLY, AND I COULD TAKE 30 PALESTI30MINUTES TO DO THIS, I T BELIEVE ANY EMAILS AND PHONE CALLS, HEY, JEFF CAN YOU SEE THIS ABOUT GENERALLY RECEIVED POOR CONDITION OF OUR ROADS AFTER THE SNOWSTORM ON MONDAY. I FEEL COMPELLED TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THAT. WE SPENT A LOT OF MONEY ON A LOT OF THINGS AND SEVEN DAYS AFTER A MAJOR SNOW EVENT, I STILL HAVE STREETS IN NEIGHBORHOODS THAT HAS 2 INCHES OF ICE ON. IF IT WASN'T FOR THE BEAUTIFUL WEATHER THIS AFTERNOON, THEY PROBABLY STILL WOULD TONIGHT. I'M CONCERNED ABOUTT. I DON'T KNOW WHO IS ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE POOR CONDITION OF OUR ROADS. I TOOK MY DAUGHTER OUT TO HER MUSIC LESSON IN IPSI, THEY HAVE A MUCH LOWER PROPERTY VALUE AND THEY HAVE A HIGHER MILLAGE RATE. THEY DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO WORK WITH THAT WE DO. I WANTED TO EXPRESS ON BEHALF OF ALL THE RESIDENTS THAT WROTE ME, I SHARE YOUR CONCERNS ABOUT THE ROADS AFTER THE STORM EVENT ESPECIALLY WITH THE BIKE LANES. WITH THOSE BALLA BOLLARDS, THE S HAVE TO GO AROUND THEM. WE ARE AT ODDS ABOUT THE SAFE TRANSPORTATION. AND LASTLY, I NO HE THAT THERE'S SOME FOLKS DISAPPOINTED WITH WHAT THEY CALL THE CITY COUNCIL'S LACK OF ACTION. THE SHIP OF STATE TURNS VERY SLOWLY. AND NOW I REALLY FEEL THAT WE FINALLY HAVE A MAJORY IT OF PEOPLE ON COUNCIL WHO ARE INTERESTED IN TAKING REAL ACTION ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THE CONVERSATIONS AROUND THESE RESOLUTIONS AND SOME OF THEM -- MOST OF THEM ARE ON THE CONSENT AGENDA. I THINK WE WILL BE PULLING THEM OUT TO TALK ABOUT THEM, BUT I APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S INTEREST IN PUSHING TOWARDS THIS GOAL. AND I THINK WE ARE GETTING A LOT CLOSER HERE AND TONIGHT IS GOING TO BE A WATERSHED NIGHT FOR COUNCIL WHERE WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE FULLY SUPPORTIVE OF THESE DEVELOPMENTS AND THIS MYTH THAT THERE'S AN ANTI-DEVELOPMENT MAJORITY IS JUST THAT. IT'S A MYTH. WE ARE HERE TO WORK WITH THE CITY AND WE'RE HERE TO SUPPORT AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND HOUSING OPTIONS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE AND SUPPORT OF THAT EFFORT.
01:20:39.319: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILWOMAN GRISWOLD.
01:20:40.720: >> Councilmember Griswold: FIRST, I WOULD LIKE TO APOLOGIZE. I MISSED THE DEMONSTRATION YESTERDAY. I ALSO MISSED THE CAUCUS. I HAD TO LEAVE EARLY FOR A MEET A FEW WEEKS AGO. WE FINALLY DISCOVERED WHAT THE PROBLEM IS. I HAVE SOME THYROID ISSUES. I EXPECT TO HAVE THEM TAKEN CARE OF IN A FEW WEEKS, BUT I JUST WANT TO ALSO APOLOGIZE FOR EMAILS THAT I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO KEEP UP WITH. I HAVE THREE QUICK ITEM, THE COUNCIL APPROVED THE STATE CROSSWALK LAW. THAT'S MOVING FORWARD. IT HAS ENDORSEMENT FROM MANY COMMUNITIES ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE STATE. I DISCUSSED IT WITH THE GOVERNOR ON SATURDAY AND LEE CHATWELL WHO IS THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE, AND SO I EXPECT MORE TRACTION IN THE NEAR FUTURE. I DID RECOMMEND THAT THESABILITN AMENDMENT TO THIS BILL, AND THAT WOULD BE TO MOVE SOME LANGUAGE THAT'S IN THE UNIFORM TRAFFIC CODE OVER TO THE MICHIGAN VEHICLE CODE, DEALING WITH PERSONS WITH VISIBILITY -- ANYWAY, IT'S CALLED THE WHITE CANE LAW. I'M TRYING TO BE POLITICALLY CORRECT HERE. NUMBER TWO, I WILL HAVE MY COMMUNICATIONS RESOLUTION AT THE NEXT COUNCIL MEETING. IF ANYONE IS INTERESTED IN PROVIDING FEEDBACK, THE BEST WAY TO DO IT IS TO DISCUSS IT IN AN OPEN MEETING BECAUSE IF I GET INFORMATION FROM MORE THAN A QUORUM OF COUNCILMEMBERS THAT'S A PROBLEM. AND IT'S FOCUS ON TRANSPARENCY AND COLLABORATION AND ACCURATE DATA. THE LAST THING IS I'M REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT STREET LIGHTS AND I KNOW THAT OUR CITY ADMINISTRATOR IS WORKING WITH D.T.E. BUT THE FACT THAT WE HAVE HAD STREET LIGHTS OUT FOR AT LEAST A MONTH IN FRONT OF CITY HALL, WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN BRING IN PORTABLE LIGHTS FOR CONSTRUCTION ZONES. SO I DON'T WANT TO MICROMANAGE BUT WE NEED TO DO THAT. WE ALSO NEED TO LOOK AT WHERE WE ARE PUTTING IN NEW CROSSWALKS WITHOUT ANY STREET LIGHTS. THANK YOU.
01:23:00.060: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:23:00.927: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. WELL, COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER STOLE SOME OF MY THUNDER. I APPRECIATE IT. THIS IS OUR FIRST -- OUR FIRST FULL YEAR IS IN THE BOOKS AS NEW COUNCILMEMBERS. THIS REALLY STARTS OUR SECOND YEAR AROUND THE SUN. SO IT'S FEELING LIKE WE ARE STARTING TO GET OUR GROOVE. I HOPE. AND TALKS ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WE HAD A GREAT PRESENTATION THAT OUTLINED IT VERY WELL. SO WE HAVE TAKEN A LOT OF CRITICISMS. BUT I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD THINGS THAT WILL BE COMING SOON. I DO ALSO WANT TO TALK ABOUT LAST WEEK'S STORM. I KNOW IT CAUGHT EVERYBODY OFFGUARD. EVEN PRIVATE CONTRACTORS WERE CAUGHT OFFGUARD. IT TOOK THEM LONGER TO CLEAN UP THAN IT SHOULD HAVE, BUT WITHOUT CRITICIZING THE HARD-WORKING FOLKS OF THE CITY, I KNOW THEY ARE OUT THERE IN TERRIBLE CONDITIONS, FIXING WATER MAINS AND DANGEROUS CONDITIONS AND -- BUT WE DO NEED TO IMPROVE OUR CONDITIONS. IT'S JUST WE ARE NOT THE BEST IN THE AREA WHEN IT COMES TO CLEANING OUR SNOW. AND IT DOES HAMPER OUR GOALS. WE TALK ABOUT MOBILITY AND TRANSPORTATION. FRANKLY, YOU COULDN'T GET AROUND FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS UNLESS YOU HAD A FOUR-WHEEL DRIVE TRUCK OR, YOU KNOW, YOU CAN GET AROUND OTHER WAYS AS WELL, OF COURSE, BUT IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT. AND I THINK IT'S TIME TO TAKE BETTER ACTION. WE WILL NEED TO FIND BETTER WAYS TO DO A BETTER JOB. I LOOK TO GET SUPPORT FROM THE D. D.A., PERFECT. S WITH THE ADDITIONAL -- PERHAPS WITH THE ADDITIONAL MONEY THAT THEY WILL BE COLLECTING AT THE STREET ETERS, THEY CAN PUT IT TOWARDS HELP CLEANING THE SIDEWALKS, MAKE THEM CROSSABLE. IT'S JUST UNACCEPTABLE AND WE'LL CONTINUE TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE. FURTHER, I WOULD LIKE TO PUT A CALL OUT TO EXTEND OUR COMPOSTING. I DON'T BELIEVE WITH THE SNOW AND THE WEATHER, MANY FOLKS ARE GOING TO FINISH CLEANING THEIR YARDS BEFORE THE DEADLINE. SO I PUT ANOTHER CALL OUT TO EXTENDURE COMPOSTING. THANK YOU.
01:25:38.351: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER COMMUNICATION FROM COUNCIL? COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
01:25:44.090: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. JUST QUICK. I HAVE A COUPLE OF COMMISSIONS THAT I AM LIAISON TO OR A MEMBER OF, THAT ARE STILL LOOKING FOR MEMBERS. ONE WE HAVE ANOTHER OPENING ON THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION. SO IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN SERVING ON THAT, I ENCOURAGE YOU TO GET AN APPLICATION IN. ALSO, WE'RE LOOKING FOR A COUPLE OF POSITIONS ON THE GREEN BELT, AND ESPECIALLY FOR SOMEONE IN THE COMMUNITY WHO WORKS IN REAL ESTATE, THERE'S A DEDICATED SPOT ON THE GREEN BELT ADVISORY COMMISSION FOR THAT PERSON. IF YOU WORK IN REAL ESTATE, AND YOU ARE INTERESTED IN LAND PRESEVENPRESERVATION, I ENCOURAO GET AN APPLICATION IN.
01:26:28.134: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER COMMUNICATIONS? I WOULD LIKE TO REQUEST CONFIRMATION OF THE FOLLOWING APPOINTMENTS TO THE CITY COUNCIL ON NOVEMBER 4, 2019, TO THE COMMISSION ON DISABILITY ISSUES ALEX GOSSAGE. AND TO THE ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS, CHRIS FRALEIGN. MOVES BY COUNCILMEMBER, SMITH AND SECONDED BY RAMLAWI. DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
01:26:47.153: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I KNOW MR. FRALEIGH IS A NEIGHBOR AND EVENEST AND I APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT FOR HIS NOMINATION. HE'S VERY INTERESTED IN THIS. AND I SPEAK VERY HIGHLY OF HIS COMMITMENT TO THIS PROJECT.
01:27:02.969: >> Mayor Taylor: EXCELLENT. FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. AND THE FOLLOWING APPOINTMENTS JOHN FORNIER, TO THE EMPLOYMENT RETIREE SYSTEM BOARD OF TRUSTEES, BROCK HASTIE AND THE VEBA, ALSO BROCK HASTIE. I ALSO HAVE A NUMBER OF ARE SEW SOLUTIONS THAT I WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT FOR CONSIDERATION, RESOLUTION APPOINTING RICHARD CHANG TO THE ANN ARBOR AREA TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY BOARD AND JULIE LYNCH TO THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT SYSTEM BOARD OF TRUSTEES AND VEBA AND AYESHA EDWIN TO THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION. MAY I HAVE A MOTION TO APPROVE THE CONSENT AGENDA, MOVED BY LUMM AND SECONDED BY ACKERMAN. DISCUSSION OF THE CONSENT AGENDA? COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN?
01:27:51.050: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I WANT TO DISCUSS CA-10 THROUGH 16 IN ONE GO. A TREMENDOUS THANK YOU TO JENNER HALL AND ALL OF -- JENNIFER HALL AND ALL OF STAVING COMMISSION. THIS IS QUITE A FEAT TO PRODUCE SOMETHING OF THIS QUALITY AND CALIBER IN EIGHT MONTHS AND I THINK WE ARE INCREDIBLY GRATEFUL. COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER AND I SAW THE HOUSING REPORT ABOUT A MONTH AGO AT THE HOUSING HUMAN SERVICES ADVISORY BOARD AND I'M EVEN MORE EXCITED ABOUT IT TONIGHT. THE REPORT IN FRONT OF US INDICATES THAT THERE'S I APPROACPRACTICAL APPROACH, AND S WORKING IN THE SERVICE INDUSTRY, TEACHERS IN THEIR EARLY CAREER, VETERANS WHO NEED A LITTLE BIT OF HELP. 927 UNITS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING CAN PROVIDE A ROOF FOR 3,000 NEIGHBORS. AND THESE ARE NEIGHBORS WHO WE ARE PRICING OUT FASTER AND FASTER EVERY YEAR AS OUR RENTS INCREASE YEAR OVER YEAR BY 16%, AND THE DIFFICULTY TO BUY INTO THIS COMMUNITY BECOMES EVEN GREATER. THE REPORT LAYS OUT A LOT OF DIVERSE SITES WITH DIVERSE MEANS OF DEVELOPMENT, WHICH MEANS HOMEOWNERSHIP MODELS WHICH MEANS RENTAL MODELS. IT MEANS A BALANCE OF SUPPORTIVE SERVICES THROUGH PEOPLE LIVING INDEPENDENTLY, BUT JUST NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE OPPORTUNITY TO LIVE CLOSER TO WHERE THEY WORK. SO A HUGE THANK YOU AGAIN TO EVERYONE INVOLVED. I'M EXCITED TO VOTE ALL OF THESE THROUGH AS THEY ARE TONIGHT. BUT I UNDERSTAND IF COLLEAGUES HAVE QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED. JUST KEEP IN MIND AS WE DO DELIBERATE, THAT THIS IS -- THIS IS DECIDING WHAT DIRECTION WE WANT TO HEAD DOWN. THIS IS WHERE WE NEED TO GO. IT IS NOT THE DETAILS OF HOW WE ARE GOING TO GET THERE. THAT WILL COME IN TIME. AND SO TONIGHT IS REALLY AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL OF US TO GET BEHIND THIS REPORT, AND TAKE THE NEXT STEP TO TAKE IT OFF THE SHELF AND MAKE IT PRACTICAL AND IMPACTFUL IN OUR COMMUNITY. SO THANK YOU.
01:30:08.221: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE CONSENT AGENDA.
01:30:11.624: >> Councilmember Eaton: I WOULD LIKE TO PULL CONSENT AGENDA ITEMS 10 THROUGH 16 FROM THE CONCEPT AGENDA.
01:30:17.363: >> Mayor Taylor: 10 THROUGH 16.
01:30:20.366: >> Councilmember Eaton: AND --
01:30:21.000: >> Mayor Taylor: YOU STILL HAVE THE FLOOR.
01:30:22.602: >> Councilmember Eaton: AND ALSO CONSENT AGENDA ITEM 19.
01:30:31.577: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:30:37.416: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: COUNCILMEMBER PULLED ALL OF THE ONES I WANTED TO PULL.
01:30:45.324: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WOULD LIKE TO PULL CA-8.
01:30:47.860: >> Councilmember Bannister: IS IT POSSIBLE TO ADD DC-ON MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING RESOLUTION OVER HERE TO DISCUSS -- DISCUSSION OF THESE OTHER CONSENT AGENDA AFFORDABLE HOUSING RESOLUTIONS?
01:31:04.410: >> Chair Milshteyn: SOLUTIONS.
01:31:05.044: >> Mayor Taylor: THAT WOULD REQUIRE REOPENING THE AGENDA FOR THE PURPOS-- AND DC-3 MIGHT BE USEFUL TO DISCUSS PRIOR TO DC-4. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
01:31:24.297: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES, JUST A COUPLE OF COMMENTS ABOUT CA-6 I DON'T NEED TO PULL IT. IT'S THE GLACIER HILLS EARHART VILLAGE SETTLEMENT. I WOULD LIKE TO NOTE FOR MY COLLEAGUES THAT THIS IS A RESOLUTION THAT AUTHORIZES A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT REGARDING POM LITIGATION INVOLVING GLACIER HILLS, THE EARHART VILLAGE HOMES ASSOCIATION AND THE CITY, THERE HAS BEEN A LONG-STANDING DISPUTE OF THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PARTIES IN ANY DEVELOPMENT AND I'M PLEASED THAT THE -- THE -- I SEE THAT THE PARTIES HAVE COME TO AN AGREEMENT THAT EVERYONE CAN LIVE WITH. AND I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE FOR FACILITATING THIS AGREEMENT, AND THE GLACIER HILLS AND EARHART FOLKS FOR WOKING THIS OUT. THIS RELATES -- THIS GOES BACK MANY YEARS, BACK TO SCENIC EASEMENT THAT'S BEEN IN PLACE ON THE GLACIER HILLS PROPERTY SINCE 1971, AND THEN IN 1984, THE LARGER SCENIC PLEA EASEMENT WAS REMOVED. THERE WAS A CONSERVATION EASEMENT AND DECLARATION OF BUILDING AND USE RESTRICTION PUT IN PLACE REGARDING OPEN SPACE ON THE SOUTHERN BOUNDARY OF GLACIER HILLS ADJACENT TO EARHART VILLAGE. AGAIN, THE PARTIES ARE CURRENTLY IN DISAGREEMENT AS TO WHETHER THE EASEMENT AND THE RESTRICTIONS REQUIRED GLACIER HILLS TO SEEK APPROVAL FROM THE EARHART VILLAGE HOMES, ACROSS THE ENTIRE SITE OR JUST WITHIN APPROXIMATELY 3-ACRE EASEMENT AREA. BUT THIS AGREEMENT DOES ALLOW DEVELOPMENT TO PROCEED ON THE GLACIER HILLS SITE WITH RESTRICTIONS AND SPECIFIC NOTICE TO THE EARHART VILLAGE AS STATED IN THE RESOLUTION. SO AGAIN, I WOULD LIKE TO THANK ALL OF THOSE INVOLVED WITH BRINGING THIS FORWARD. THE PARTIES ARE HAPPY TO SEE THIS BEFORE US TONIGHT. THANK YOU.
01:33:20.846: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
01:33:23.482: >> Councilmember Bannister:  I WILL THOUGHT I MAYBE STILL HAD THE FLOOR. WHAT WAS THE FINAL DECISION ON MOVING THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AT BAPACKARD ROAD TO THE OTHER AFFORDABLE HOUSING.
01:33:33.225: >> Mayor Taylor: IF YOU WANTED TO DO THAT, YOU INT NEED TO REON THE AGENDA AND HAVE THAT PASSED AND HAVE THE AGENDA AMENDED AND HAVE THAT BROUGHT OVER.
01:33:46.205: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I MOVE THAT I REOPEN THE AGENDA.
01:33:50.743: >> Mayor Taylor: I ASSUME YOU WISH TO -- WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CONSENT AGENDA AND THEN WE CAN FIGURE OUT --
01:34:00.720: >> Councilmember Bannister: WELL, WE WOULD LIKE TO PAY CA-21. PULL CA-21.
01:34:10.196: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE CONSENT AGENDA? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
01:34:14.467: >> Councilmember Hayner:  JUST BRIEFLY, ON CA-1, WE HAD THIS CONVERSATION LAST YEAR, THAT IS A LEASING A SMALL PARKING LOT TO THE UNIVERSITY THAT THE CITY HAPPENS TO OWN BEHIND A UNIVERSITY BUILDING THERE, FOR THIS PALTRY SUM OF $4,100, AND THEY ARE RELEASING THAT PARKING LOT A SUBSTANTIAL PROFIT. LOOKING AT THE UNIVERSITY'S TAX EXEMPT STATUS, I CRINGE WHEN I THINK WE ARE UNDER VALUING THAT PARKING LOT AND SO I WON'T SUPPORT THAT. IT NEEDS EIGHT VOTES BUT I -- I CAN'T SUPPORT UNDER VALUING OUR CITY INFRASTRUCTURE WHEN WE ARE LEASING TO THE UNIVERSITY -- WHEN THEY ARE RELEASING IT FOR PROPERTY AND THE SAME THING HAPPENS ON THE FULLER PARK. WE DO THE SAME THING THERE. THEY ARE TURNING THAT INTO A GOLD AND BLUE LOT AND WE LEASE IT TO THEM AND WE DON'T MAKE THE KIND OF MONEY WE SHOULD ON THAT. SO I'M JUST GOING TO HANG THAT OUT THERE FOR EVERYBODY AS WE BRING THIS PILOT PROJECT FORWARD INTO THE BUDGET SEASON, WE WILL BE HAVING MORE OF THESE CONVERSATIONS, BUT I CAN'T SUPPORT CA-1.
01:35:25.571: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
01:35:27.406: >> Councilmember Grand: IT'S MY RECOLLECTION THAT UNDER CA-1 THERE WAS A QUESTION THAT COUNCILMEMBER LUMM WAS ASKING, HOW MUCH THEY CHARGE FOR THAT PARKING AND I BELIEVE IT WAS $167 A YEAR, AND IT'S 12 TO 15 SPACES. SO BY CITY'S MATH, IT'S ABOUT 27 -- WELL, WHATEVER IS, IT'S LESS -- A LITTLE OVER $2,000 THAT THE UNIVERSITY IS GETTING. SO THEY ARE SUBSIDIZING ACCORDING TO WHAT THEY ARE CHARGING FOR. I'M WITH YOU ON THE -- I UNDERSTAND AND I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT FULLER AND BLUE, BUT I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE CASE HERE.
01:36:09.815: >> I'M NOT SURE -- THIS HASN'T BEEN ON THE AGENDA FOR FIVE YEARS. WE HAD A FIVE-YEAR LEASE WITH THEM AND IT WAS ON THE AGENDA FIVE YEARS AGO TO ENTER INTO THIS CURRENT LEASE AND PRIOR TO THAT, IT WAS MONTH-TO-MONTH FOR 20-SOME YEARS. SO IT MAY BE A DIFFERENT PROPERTY, BUT, YES THIS IS USED FOR THE FLETCHER HALL STUDENT PARKING.
01:36:39.211: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
01:36:40.713: >> Councilmember Lumm: THIS RENEWAL REFLECTS A 3% INCREASE AND SO WE'RE COLLECTING A BIT MORE FROM THE U OF M THAN THEY COLLECT ON THE YELLOW PASSES WHICH IS REQUIRED, WHICH IS $275 PER PASS PER YEAR. VERSUS WHAT WE COLLECT FROM STUDENTS, $167 PER STUDENT PER YEAR. THERE IS A U OF M REPRESENTATIVE HERE. MR. RAIN IS HERE. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANTED TO SPEAK TO THIS OR NOT.
01:37:24.456: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCIL IF YOU WANT IT AND IF COUNCIL WANTS DID --
01:37:27.293: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I FEEL WE UNDER VALUE THESE RESOURCES WHEN WE LEASE THEM OFF TO THE UNIVERSITY.
01:37:32.431: >> Mayor Taylor: I'M WILLING TO MOVE. FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE CONSENT AGENDA? ALL IN FAVOR OF THE CONSENT AGENDA WITH THE EXCEPTION OF -- COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, DO YOU WANT TO PULL THIS ONE SO YOU CAN VOTE --
01:37:46.312: >> Councilmember Hayner:  NO, I DON'T CARE.
01:37:48.380: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
01:37:48.981: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I MEAN, I CARE BUT I WON'T HOLE UP THE -- HOLD UP THE REST OF THE CONSENT AGENDA FOR A PRINCIPLED VOTE.
01:37:56.755: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE CONSENT AGENDA WITH THE E EXEMPTSON I DON'T OF A-10-16, AND 19. [CHORUS OF AYES] IT'S APPROVED, THUS SATISFYING THE EIGHT VOTE REQUIREMENT WITH RESPECT TO CA-1, CA, 2CA-3, CA-4, CA-5, CA-7, CA-17, CA-18. THAT IS ALL. C.A.10 RESOLUTION TO DIRECT THE ANN ARBOR HOUSING COMMISSION TO DEVELOP 121 EAST CATHERINE AND 404 NORTH ASHLEY AS AFFORDABLE HOUSING. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER EATON. THANK YOU. FURTHER DISCUSSION OF CA-10. COUNCILMEMBER EATON?
01:38:48.407: >> Councilmember Eaton: THANK YOU. SO I WANT TO START BY THANKING STAFF FOR ALL OF THE WORK THEY HAVE DONE IN REGARD TO ALL OF THESE AFFORDABLE HOUSING RESOLUTIONS. I'M PROUD TO HAVE SPONSORED THE APRIL 1st RESOLUTION THAT DIRECTED STAFF TO PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION TO US, AND I'M EXCITED TO HAVE A MORE IN-DEPTH DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS. AND IT JUST HAPPENS THAT WE HAVE A WORK SESSION SCHEDULED FOR JANUARY 13th TO DISCUSS AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SO I WILL BE MOVING TO POSTPONE THIS IN A COUPLE OF MOMENTS BUT FIRST, I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT WE HAVE BEEN GIVEN A LOT OF INFORMATION, YOU KNOW, WITHIN LAST COUPLE EVER W OF WEEKS ANDA LOT OF QUESTIONS I HAVE ABOUT EACH ONE OF THESE SITES AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THIS IS THE BEST TIME OR THE OPPORTUNITY TO DELVE INTO THOSE. ON THIS PARTICULAR RESOLUTION, CA LIV-10, ONE IS LEASED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN DENTAL SCHOOL FOR THE COMMUNITY DENTAL CLINIC AND THE UNIVERSITY REPRESENTATIVES TALKED TO ME ABOUT -- ABOUT THEIR CONCERNS THAT WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS BEFORE THEY ARE READY TO MOVE THIS CLINIC. AND SO WITH THE INDULGENCE OF MY COLLEAGUES, I WOULD LIKE TO INVITE A UNIVERSITY REPRESENTATIVE TO COME UP AND PRESENT THEIR POINT OF VIEW ON THAT PARTICULAR PROPERTY.
01:40:27.339: >> Mayor Taylor: FAIR ENOUGH. MR. REAM.
01:40:39.118: >> COUNCIL, MAYOR, THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. AS COUNCILMEMBER EATON MENTIONED, THE UNIVERSITY DOES HAVE CONCERNS. MY NAME IS MICHAEL REAM, I'M HERE WITH STEVE STEFANIC, WHO IS THE ASSOCIATE DEAN FOR THE SCHOOL OF DENTISTRY. UNDER HIS UMBRELLA, HE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COMMUNITY DENTAL CLINIC. A COUPLE OF QUICK POINTS, WE THINK THE COMMUNITY DENTAL CLINIC BEING IN PLACE FOR -- SINCE 1981 IS A REALLY GOOD EXAMPLE OF A COOPERATIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE UNIVERSITY AND THE CITY. WE THINK THAT THE VERY PEOPLE THAT WE REPRESENT THERE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT WILL BE SEEKING THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT THE CITY IS MOVING FORWARD ON. SO IT'S AN INTERESTING PARALLEL. I THOUGHT MS. HALL DID A GREAT JOB ON THE OVERALL PRESENTATION AND SHE DID A FAIR ASSESSMENT OF THE SITE. IT IS AN ATTRACTIVE SITE FOR REDEVELOPMENT. WE DO HAVE A LEASE. WE LOOK FORWARD TO FINISHING THAT LEASE BUT IN THE INTERIM, WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE CITY ON A POSSIBLE SOLUTION TO EITHER MOVE OUR FACILITY, SO ANOTHER LOCATION WITHIN THE CITY, OR PERHAPS DEVELOP A BUILDING WHERE WE COULD HAVE THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS AS WELL AS OUR DENTAL CLINIC IN ANOTHER VARIATION, OBVIOUSLY, BECAUSE IT WOULD BE A NEWER BUILDING. I THINK JENNIFER'S PRESENTATION ABOUT THE DENSITY IS IMPORTANT. I WOULD LIKE TO REMIND THE COUNCIL AS YOU DELIBERATE ABOUT THIS, ABOUT 60% -- 58% OF OUR PATIENTS COME FROM ANN ARBOR AND WASHTENAW COUNTY AND THAT'S OVER THE LAST SEVERAL DECADES. WE ARE SERVING THE CONSTITUENTS IN THIS AREA. AND THE -- THE MAJORITY, ALMOST 50% -- 60% OF THE PATIENTS SERVED HERE HAVE LOW-INCOME MEDICAID BENEFITS. IT'S A VERY MUCH NEEDED PART OF THE COMMUNITY. WE THINK IT'S BEEN A POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP. HE WOULD LIKE TO KIN WITH THAT. CONTINUE WITH THAT. AS THE PLANS DEVELOP, WE WILL WORK CLOSELY WITH THE HOUSING COMMISSION AND THE COUNCIL ON THE FRUITION AND THE NEXT STEPS.
01:43:28.587: >> Mayor Taylor: OTHER QUESTIONS? COUNCICOUNCILMEMBER GRAND AND TN RAMLAWI.
01:43:34.026: >> Councilmember Grand: SO I'M HEARING SORT OF MIXED INTERPRETATIONS OF -- OF THIS SITE. SO I'M HEARING FROM COUNCILMEMBER EATON THAT THERE'S A CONCERN, BUT WHAT I JUST HEARD IN A STATEMENT FROM YOU, IS THAT WE FEEL THAT THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT COMMUNITY BENEFIT FROM THE DENTAL CLINIC. I DON'T THINK ANYONE WOULD DISAGREE. BUT THAT THERE WOULD BE MULTIPLE WAYS GOING FORWARD, OTHER THAN KEEPING THE DENTAL CLINIC IN ITS CURRENT FORM.
01:44:00.452: >> WELL, AGAIN, IT'S BEEN A COOPERATIVE RELATIONSHIP, JULIE, OVER ALL OF THESE YEARS. AND JUST AS RECENTLY AS 2016, IT WAS THE HOUSING COMMISSION THAT MOVED OUT OF THE BASEMENT, THE UNIVERSITY MADE A SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT TO ALLOW PATIENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS THAT WE CAN'T SERVE AT THE SCHOOL OF DENTISTRY. SO THAT FACILITY WAS UPGRADED FOR THAT. SO WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE CITY ON THAT. HOW THE CITY DEVELOPS 404, 406, IS OUT OF OUR HANDS BECAUSE YOU OWN THE PROPERTY. SO TO BE CANDID OR IF THE MARKET CHANGES ELSEWHERE, THAT ALLOWED US TO CONTINUE OUR OPERATIONS, THAT AND EXTEND OUR LEASE AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME IN 2024, BUT IF THAT'S NOT IN THE CARDS, WE ARE CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO BE FIGHTING WITH THE CITY. YOU L OWN THE PROPERTY AND WE LK FORWARD TO A COLLABORATIVE RELATIONSHIP. WE UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION. IT'S ALWAYS BEEN COOPERATIVE AND WE THINK IT'S A COMMUNITY JEWEL AND WE THINK IT'S A MUCH NEEDED USE. SO WE'RE LOOKING TO CONTINUE IN THAT LOCATION IF WE CAN. AND THAT'S NOT IN THE CARDS BECAUSE OF THE CITY'S PLANS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND WE HAVE TO FACE THAT FACT AND, YOU KNOW, TRY TO BE COOPERATIVE AND GOOD PARTNERS GOING FORWARD.
01:45:30.041: >> Councilmember Grand: OKAY. BUT I THINK, YOU KNOW, WHAT I -- WHAT I -- THE FEEDBACK HE WANT TO GIVE TO YOU, I THINK THERE ARE MULTIPLE WAYS THAT WE COULD WORK ON THIS PARTNERSHIP TOGETHER, AND AS MS. HALL POINTED OUT, YOU KNOW, BEST CASE SCENARIO, WE ARE LOOKING AT 3 TO 5 YEARS TO DEVELOP A PROPERTY. SO I THINK THAT COMES UP WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO THIS.
01:45:56.768: >> ABSOLUTELY AND THAT'S WHY DR. STEFANIC IS HERE. WE WANTED TO REPRESENT THE UNIVERSITY AND SHOW THE SUPPORT FOR THE COMMUNITY DENTAL CENTER BECAUSE WE THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE FABRIC OF THE COMMUNITY.
01:46:14.619: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER, RAMLAWI.
01:46:16.221: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. IT SOUNDS A LITTLE UNUSUAL FOR THE UNIVERSITY IN THIS POSITION, BEING ONE OF THE BIGGEST LANDOWNERS IN THE CITY TO, YOU KNOW, BE IN THIS POSITION, WHEN IT COMES TO A LEASE, AND THE CITY-OWNED PROPERTY. QUITE UNUSUAL. EYE TRYING TI'M TRYING TO UNDERE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE SERVICE, AND THIS PROPERTY, AND FURTHER, WHAT ARE THE CURRENT PLANS? I MEAN, 18 MONTHS IS A RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME, BY NOW THE UNIVERSITY HAS PROBABLY THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT THEY WILL DO NEXT. ARE THERE OPTIONS TO RENEW? ARE THERE OTHER PLANS? AND WHAT IS THE, YOU KNOW -- THE STRONG INTEREST IN MAINTAINING THIS PARTICULAR LOCATION, IF I CAN ASK. I WILL ASK ONE MORE AFTER THAT.
01:47:08.340: >> YES WE HAVE A CURRENT LEASE THAT RUNS UNTIL 2021, ALI, WITH A THREE-YEAR OPTION TO EXPAND. SO THE WHOLE LEASE RUNS TO 2024. AND THAT'S WITHIN THREE TO FIVE YEARS THAT JENNIFER HALL MENTIONED, THAT IS KIND OF THE END DATES, JUNE OF 2024. AND IN TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT, YOU NO HE, WE TAKE CARE OF ALL THE MAINTENANCE. WE RECENTLY SPENT SOME MONEY ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BASEMENT AND THE HVAC SYSTEM AND THINGS LIKE THAT. HOWARD COULD CORRECT ME, I DON'T THINK THE CITY HAS ANY EXPENSES AT ALL AND IN TURN WE HAVE THAT RECURRING LEASE SINCE 1981 AT DIFFERENT AREAS OF LENGTH. I THINK IT'S AN UNUSUAL RELATIONSHIP IN TERMS OF US, BUT IT CAME OUT OF NECESSITY BACK IN THE EARLY '80s. THE SCHOOL OF DENTISTRY DOES TREMENDOUS OUTREACH THROUGHOUT THE STATE FOR THIS TYPE OF COMMUNITY CARE, BUT THIS TYPE OF FACILITY IS A PERMANENT FACILITY WHEREAS SOME OF THE OTHER DENTAL PROGRAMS ARE, YOU KNOW, ON THE ROAD AS IT WERE. BUT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE ENTER DENTAL SCHOOL'S PROGRAM, COMMITMENT TO THE CITY, AND IT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR THE STUDENTS. THEY MEET -- WE DO OUTREACH IN PRISON AND DIFFERENT AREAS SO THE STUDENTS CAN GET ACTUAL PRACTICE. THIS IS A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENT FACILITY, AND DR. STEFANIC CAN EXPLAIN BECAUSE WE HAVE PRACTITIONERS THERE. AS A GREAT DEAL WITH OUR PATIENTS BEING LOW-INCOME, BEING MEDICARE DEPENDENT, AND THEN A GREAT DEAL OF THEM ARE RIGHT FROM THIS AREA. SO WE THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT INSTITUTION.
01:49:14.866: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  AND WE DO TOO. I NO H KNOW MANY PEOPLE WOULD HE COME DOWN THERE AND GOT WORK DONE THAT THEY COULDN'T OTHERWISE AFFORD TO GET DONE. AND IT'S A VALUABLE PART OF OUR COMMUNITY, LEE LIKE YOU SAID ANI HOPE IT DOESN'T NO ANYWHERE. OUR CONCERN IS TO DELIVER THOSE SERVICES AS WEST NILE VIRUS TO ADDRESS THE AFFORDABILITY CRISIS THAT'S WE HAVE WITH HOUSING AND WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME TO WASTE. DOING SO, WE DON'T JEOPARDIZE THE SERVICE THAT THE UNIVERSITY PROVIDES CURRENTLY, CORRECT? IF WE WERE TO GO FORWARD, WE ARE NOT JEOPARDIZING WHAT THE UNIVERSITY DOES OR WILL CONTINUE TO DO?
01:49:54.439: >> WEST NILWELL, WE -- WE HAVE A FIVE-YEAR WINDOW TO FIGURE THINGS OUT, ALI. WE THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT SERVICE THE SCHOOL IS PROVIDING. IN THE CITY'S PLANS FOR THAT SITE FOR REDEVELOPMENT FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING THEN WE WILL HAVE TO -- THE SCHOOL WILL HAVE TO LOOK AT -- THE UNIVERSITY WILL HAVE TO LOOK AT THE DIFFERENT OPTIONS. IF, IN FACT, AN OPPORTUNITY IS TO BE PART OF THAT REDEVELOPMENT, WE WOULD CERTAINLY LOOK AT, THAT BECAUSE ALL OF OUR PATIENTS KNOW WHERE WE HAVE BEEN AT FOR, YOU KNOW, 30 YEARS. BUT, YOU KNOW, JENNIFER'S STRONG MENTION PRESENTA PRESENTATION, E THE REDEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THAT AND TO BE FAIR THE CITY HAS MADE IT CLEAR AND DR. STEFANIC, DURING OUR CONVERSATION LAST WEEK, THIS HAS BEEN HINTED AT. WE ALWAYS KNEW WE WERE THE LEASEE, AND SO THIS WAS NOT A SURPRISE. ABOUT THIS. IT'S A PART OF THE FABRIC OF THE CLINIC BUT WE THINK IT'S A COOPERATIVE RELATIONSHIP AND WE WANT TO WORK FORWARD WITH THE HOUSING COMMISSION AS THE PLANS EVOLVE.
01:51:06.511: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU.
01:51:09.814: >> Mayor Taylor: I WILL -- WE HAVE ON THE QUEUE, MYSELF, COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN, AND THEN COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD. I HAVE NO QUESTIONS. I'M GOING TO VOTE ABSOLUTELY IN FAVOR OF CA-10, I WILL VOTE AGAINST ANY SUGGESTION THAT WE POSTPONE THIS. THE TIME IS NOW FOR US TO MOVE FORWARD. WE CONSIDERED THESE THINGS FOR QUITE SOMETIME. I HIGHLY VALUE THE UNIVERSITY CLINIC, AND KNOW VERY WELL THE IMPORTANCE -- THE IMPORTANT ROLE THAT IT SERVES TO MANY MEMBERS IN OUR COMMUNITY AND OUTSIDE THE COMMUNITY. I'M HIGHLY CONFIDENT THAT THE PLANNING PROCESS WILL ENSURE THAT THAT CLINIC HAS A PLACE, WHETHER AT THIS LOCATION. THERE'S NO REASON IN MY VIEW, WHY IT COULDN'T SERVE AS A GROUND FLOOR TENANT TO THE STRUCTURE OR THAT OUR SCHEDULE WILL BE SUCH THAT WE WILL ACCOMMODATE -- ACCOMMODATE THE CLINIC TO ENSURE ITS PROPER AND EFFECTIVE FUNCTIONING GOING FORWARD. BUT I THINK WE NEED TO MOVE AND WE NEED TO MOVE NOW ON THESE MATTERS. COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
01:52:12.544: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  I WILL BE BRIEF. IF WE ARE GOING TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE CITY, I WILL BE VOTING ON THIS TONIGHT AND NOT ANY POSTPONEMENT.
01:52:23.288: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
01:52:24.189: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I SERVED OPEN THE DENTAL COMMUNITY BOARD FOR SEVERAL YEARS. I DO SUPPORT COMMUNITY HOUSING. AND I HOPE WE CAN WORK OUT AN AGREEMENT WHERE THEY CAN BE ON THE FIRST FLOOR. IT'S AN EXCELLENT MODEL BECAUSE 40% OF THE PATIENTS ARE FULL PAYING OR INSURANCE PAYING CUSTOMERS. SO THEY VIEW IT AS THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD DENTAL CENTER. AND THAT INFLUX OF CAPITAL IS WHAT ALLOWS THEM TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES THAT THEY DO FOR ALL OF THE LOW INCOME AND ESPECIALLY WORKFORCE-TYPE INDIVIDUALS WHO DO NOT HAVE INSURANCE. SO I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT IT.
01:53:07.498: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER AND LUMM AND THEN I WILL SUGGEST THAT WE HAVE A LOT TO GO OVER AND THAT IT'S 9:00.
01:53:13.371: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU. I DON'T THINK WE HAD A MOTION TO POSTPONE, RIGHT?
01:53:17.508: >> Mayor Taylor: WE HAVE NOT.
01:53:20.945: >> Councilmember Hayner:  JUST DISCUSSED. I'M GLAD. I HAVE SPENT LANGUAGE AROUND NO CHANGE THESE AND ADD A RESOLVE CLAUSE. I WILL ASK THAT WE ADD AN RESOLVE CLAUSE. RESOLVE ANY BUILDINGS ON THE CITY-OWNED SITES SHOULD BE DESIGNED AND BUILT TO BE 100% CARBON NEUTRAL AND HAVE NET ZERO OPERATING EXPENSES. I USE THE WORD STRIVE CAREFULLY, BUT IT'S IN KEEPING IN LINE WITH OUR GOALS. I ASK THAT WE MOVE THIS RESOLVE CLAUSE. IS THERE A SECOND? SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
01:54:02.520: >> Councilmember Hayner:  SO IF I MAY. I PUT THAT OUT THERE BECAUSE IT'S IN KEEPING IN LINE WITH THE CLIMATE EMERGENCY WE DECLARED AND THE ONLY OPPORTUNITIES THE CITY HAS TO COMPEL THIS TYPE OF CARBON ZERO, NET ZERO BUILDING, IS THE BUILDING THAT WE DO OURSELVES. AND SO I WOULD URGE US TO CONSIDER DESIGNING AND BUILDING TO THE NET ZERO OPERATING EXPENSES GOING MOVE AND THAT WILL ALLOW US TO PUT MORE MONEY INTO SERVICES AND LESS INTO PAYING ENERGY. IT'S SOMETHING TO CONSIDER AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THESE RESOLUTIONS. I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A STARTING POINT. I SUPPORT THIS EITHER WAY, BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE LAY IT ALL OUT THERE, THAT THIS IS WHAT OUR GOALS ARE FOR CITY DEVELOPED PARCELS.
01:54:55.673: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN AND SMITH.
01:54:56.741: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I'M GENERALLY SUPPORTIVE OF THE INTENT, FINANCIAL MODELING IS COMPLEX, AND YOU PULL ONE LEVER AND SOMETHING COMPLETELY RANDOM COULD HAPPEN. COULD I ASK MS. HALL A QUESTION. GRANTED, YOU PROVIDED WIDE RANGES OF PROJECTED LOCAL FUNDING NEEDS TO MEET THE GOALS ARTICULATED IN THE REPORT WITH THE INSERTION OF A REQUIREMENT LIKE THIS, DO YOU PREDICT THAT THOSE WIDE RANGES HOLD TRUE, ESPECIALLY AS WE ROLL BACK THE NEEDS FOR PARKING?
01:55:28.673: >> I WOULD LOVE IT IF WE DID EXACTLY WHAT COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER DID. THE GOOD THING ABOUT HAVING THE HOUSING COMMISSIONER THE DEVELOPER, ONCE WE FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH IT COSTS, THEN CITY COUNCIL CAN MAKE A DECISION. WE CAN LOOK AT DIFFERENT OPTIONS AND HOW TO BUILD THE BUILDING. I WOULD LOO LOVE TO DO THAT.
01:55:59.437: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER SMITH.
01:56:01.606: >> Councilmember Smith: I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED AS TO WHAT ZERO NET OPERATING EXPENSES MEAN. YOU MEAN NET ZERO ENERGY COSTS?
01:56:08.946: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES. SORRY.
01:56:10.948: >> Councilmember Smith: MAYBE WE COULD CLARIFY THAT, BECAUSE I READ THAT AS THE OPERATING EXPENSES OF THE BUILDING HAVE TO BE NET ZERO.
01:56:16.888: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S MAINTENANCE AND MAINTENANCE SCHEDULES AND SO ON WITH THESE BUILDINGS.
01:56:23.928: >> Councilmember Smith: MAYBE TO ACHIEVE NET ZERO ENERGY USE.
01:56:26.864: >> Councilmember Hayner: SURE.
01:56:28.332: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THAT FRIENDLY AMENDMENT TO THE AMENDMENT.
01:56:30.301: >> Councilmember Hayner:  IT'S FINE WITH ME.
01:56:33.137: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. LAZARUS.
01:56:34.005: >> City Admin. Lazarus: I APPRECIATE THE INTENT AND I'M NOT SURE IT'S ACHIEVABLE IN A BUILDING THAT HAS A HIGH F.A.R. AND SMALL ROOF TOP TO PUT SOLAR ON A BUILDING TO MAKE IT NET ZERO. THE CITY IS EXPLORING MEANS TO ADD A RENEWABLE ENERGY TO THE GRID. THAT'S A COMPLICATED ISSUE THAT WILL BE BACK FROM MY DISCUSSIONS WITH COUNCIL, BUT THE ONLY WAY FOR A BUILDING LIKE THAT TO GET TO NET ZERO IS THROUGH CONTROLLING THE USE OF THE ENERGY THAT COMES INTO IT. RIGHT NOW WE HEAT OUR BUILDINGS WITH NATURAL GAS. UNTIL WE CAN PROGRESS AS A COMMUNITY TO WHERE WE GET OFF NATURAL GAS OTHER SOURCES OR RENEWABLES, I DON'T KNOW THAT A SPECIFIC ONE BUILDING BY ITSELF CAN ACHIEVE CARBON NEUTRALITY AND NET ZERO EMISSIONS. I THINK IT'S OVERLY RESTRICTIVE.
01:57:26.858: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
01:57:28.593: >> Councilmember Lumm: MY UNDERSTANDING IS THERE IS NOT A MOTION -- OR THERE IS NOT A MOTION TO POSTPONE THIS ITEM? BECAUSE I HAVE --
01:57:35.800: >> Councilmember Eaton: THERE HASN'T BEEN YET.
01:57:38.202: >> Councilmember Lumm: YET. THIS ITEM CA-10 INCLUDES ACTIONS ON TWO PROPERTIES AND I WOULD LIKE TO DIVIDE THE QUESTION IF WE ARE GOING TO VOTE ON IT BECAUSE I SUPPORT ONE BUT NOT THE OTHER. SO I GUESS I WILL WAIT TO MAKE MY COMMENTS. MY COMMENTS I WOULD, THOUGH, LIKE TO THANK -- APPLAUD OUR STAFF, JENNIFER HALL, PARTICULARLY, AND ALL THE STAFF INVOLVED THAT THE REPORT WAS INCREDIBLY THOROUGH AND YOUR ANALYSIS IS SPECTACULAR. OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A BIG JOB. YOU WERE GIVEN 11 PROPERTIES TO EVALUATE AND YOU PROVIDED US A BOAT LOAD OF DATA. YOUR STRATEGIC ANALYSIS WAS EXCELLENT. SO THANK YOU. SO I WILL COMMENT ON THESE PENDING -- YEAH, THE RECOMMENDATION.
01:58:37.828: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:58:38.930: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THIS IS TO THE AMENDMENT.
01:58:43.401: >> Mayor Taylor: TO THE AMENDMENT.
01:58:45.169: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I LIKE THE SPIRIT THAT IT'S COMING FROM, BUT I HAVE A REALLY BIG PROBLEM SUPPORTING IT BASED ON WHAT OUR CITY ADMINISTRATOR JUST SAID, AND I WAS GOING TO SAY THE SAME THING, HAS THIS EVEN BEEN DONE ANYWHERE? HAVE BUILDINGS BEEN BUILT THAT HAVE BEEN CARBON NEUTRAL TO THIS POINT, AND ARE THERE ANY THAT HAVE THIS ZERO CARBON EMISSION HERE. WE ARE ASKING FOR A LOT HERE. CAN WE GET A UNICORN? THROW IN A UNICORN? I'M SORRY, FOLKS. I WANT TO STAY SERIOUS. WE WANT TO DELIVER AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND WE ARE PUTTING A LOT OF EXPENSIVE RESTRICTIONS ON IT AND I JUST -- I REALLY HAVE A HARD TIME THROWING ALL OF THIS INTO ONE THING AND SAYING, BRING IT BACK AND MAKE SURE IT'S AFFORDABLE. I JUST BUNT -- BUT I DO ASK THIS QUESTION, DO WE HAVE 100% CARBON NEUTRAL BUILDINGS AND ZERO MISSIONS?
02:00:00.044: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES.
02:00:01.279: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: WHERE?
02:00:02.713: >> Councilmember Hayner:  THE MODIFICATION SHOULD HAVE SAID AS COUNCILMAN SMITH POINTED OUT. NET ZERO ENERGY OPERATING EXPENSES. AND IF YOU TALK TO MR. GROKOFF WHO IS DOING QUITE A LARGE PROJECT OVER OFF OF WASHTENAW AREA?
02:00:19.530: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  AND WHERE IS HE IN THAT PROCESS?
02:00:23.134: >> Councilmember Hayner: THERE'S ALL KIND OF NET ZERO BUILDINGS. THERE ARE'S ARCHITECTS WHO CAN SPEAK TO NET ZERO, AND THERE'S EXTRAORDINARILY LOW ENERGY OPERATING EXPENSES AND THAT -- I MEAN, THAT'S OUR GOAL HERE. THAT'S OUR GOAL AS A CITY AND WE CAN'T ACHIEVE THE CARBON NEUTRALITY BY 2030, IF WE KEEP ADDING CARBON TO OUR RESPONSIBILITIES, IT'S IMPRACTICAL NOT TO CONSIDER THIS.
02:00:50.494: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR STILL.
02:00:55.099: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I HAVE NOT SEEN THE EVIDENCE TO BASE THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE IN ANY REASONABLE TIME FRAME. NOR CAN IT COME IN AT A COST THAT WE CAN DELIVER AFFORDABLE HOUSE. I CANNOT SUPPORT THIS.
02:01:07.578: >> Mayor Taylor: FOR MY PART -- DID I SKIP YOU? FOR THE REASONS STATED BY COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, I WILL NOT SUPPORT THIS IT'S ALREADY THE PAL POLICY OF THE CITY TO HE CARBON NEUTRALITY BY 2030. THAT GOAL, THAT POLICY IS ALREADY BUNDLES INTO THIS PROJECT, THIS PROCESS. FOR THE REASONS THAT MR. LAZARUS STATED, REQUIRING FROM THE JUMP THAT THIS -- THAT THESE PARTICULAR PROJECTS HAVE THIS PARTICULAR CHARACTERISTIC, THREATENS TO MAKE THEM FUNCTIONALLABLY UNBUILDABLE. MAYBE THEY ARE, MAYBE THEY ARE NOT. I'M CONFIDENT THAT THE HOUSING COMMISSION, UNDERSTANDING OUR CARBON NEUTRALITY GOALS BEING CHARGED TO HAVE THE CARBONNEAU ELECTRICALLITY POLICY WILL GIVE US THE MOST EFFICIENT BUILDING POSSIBLE TO -- RESTRICTED IN THIS MANNER, FROM THE HIP OFF THE CUFF, I THINK RENDERS THE PROJECTS IMPRACTICAL FROM THE JUMP. COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
02:02:23.053: >> Councilmember Eaton: THANK YOU. I BELIEVE IT WAS AT OUR LAST MEETING THAT WE DECLARED A CLIMATE EMERGENCY. AND THIS BUILDING WILL TAKE FIVE YEARS TO GET PARTIED AND IT'S HALFWAY FOR THE TEN-YEAR PERIOD FOR US NOT TO EXPRESSLY STATE FOR IT NOT TO BE CARBON NEUTRAL IS TO IGNORE OUR OWN DECLARATION OF EMERGENCY. SO I -- I DON'T KNOW WHY THIS IS DIFFICULT TO SIMPLY EXPRESS THIS. AS A MATTER OF FACT, BECAUSE IT FITS THE GOAL THAT WE ALREADY EXPRESSED. IT FITS THE GOAL THAT WE EXPECT OUR HOUSING COMMISSION TO FOLLOW. IT REALLY IS A NECESSITY. IF WE ARE GOING TO GET THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY TO, CARBON NEUTRAL IN TEN YEARS, WE HAVE TO TAKE UPON OURSELVES THE DUTY OF MAKING SURE THAT WHAT WE DO FROM ITS INITIATION IS CARBON NEUTRAL:  IT'S KIND OF SILLY TO BUILD SOMETHING AND THEN HAVE TO GO BACK IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS AFTER ITS BUILD TRY TO ACCOMPLISH CARB CARBON NEUTRALIN A BUILDING THAT WE JUST BUILT. I THINK THIS AMENDMENT SIMPLY EXPRESSES OUR COMMITMENT TO ACHIEVING CARBONNEAU ELECTRICALLITY AND THE WHOLE -- CARBON NEUTRALITY AND THE WHOLE COMMUNITY. I DON'T KNOW HOW WE CAN SAY TO OURSELF AND THEY HAVE TO ACCOMPLISH THESE THINGS. SO THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY ON THE AMENDMENT.
02:04:16.233: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  SO I'M HEARING SOME DISCUSSION AND I'M HEARING DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES THAT BOTH REASONABLE FROM MEMBERS OF COUNCIL. I WOULD SUGGEST THEN THAT WE ARE NOT PREPARED TO VOTE ON THIS AMENDMENT TONIGHT. I THINK WE ARE ALL IN AGREEMENT THAT AF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS NECESSITY AND ACHIEVABLE I THINK WE SHOULD VOTE ON THAT AND I WOULD SUGGEST THAT AT A LATER DATE, SOON AFTER TONIGHT, WE BRING BACK A COMPANION RESOLUTION DIRECTING THE CITY'S ADMINISTRATOR AND THE HOUSING COMMISSION TO ANALYZE THE FEASIBILITY OF CARB CARBON NEUTY AT THESE SITES, 40ENFULLY SOME COMPROMISE THAT ACCOMPLISHES ALL OF OUR GOALS.
02:05:08.385: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER NELSON? THEY >> Councilmember Nelson:  I THINK I WILL BE REPEATING WHAT COUNCILMEMBER EATON WAS STATED. AS RECENTLY AS THE LAST MONTH, WE ARTICULATED THE IDEA THAT OUR ENTIRE COMMUNITY CAN ACHIEVE CARBON NEUTRALITY AND HERE WE CAN'T -- WE ARE NOT BRAVE ENOUGH TO ASSERT THAT WE CAN DO IT ON TWO INDIVIDUAL PROPERTIES. I GUESS I MISUNDERSTOOD THE MEANING OF WHAT WE PASSED IN THE MOST RECENT MEETING, BECAUSE THIS -- I DON'T FEEL THIS IS CONSISTENT IN ANY WAY AT ALL, AND THE FACT THAT THESE TWO CONVERSATIONS ARE HAPPENING CLOSE TOGETHER, I DON'T KNOW HOW ANYONE SITTING AT THIS TABLE CAN PRETEND THAT THEY ARE NOT CONNECTED IN SOME WAY. YEAH, I GUESS THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY. THANK YOU.
02:06:12.249: >> City Admin. Lazarus: CERTAINL Y ACHIEVING NEUTRALITY FOR CITY-OWNED PROPERTIES IS A BIG PART OF THAT, NOT ONLY IN TERMS BUT IN TERMS  TERMS SETTING THE- EXAMPLE, BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF FACTORS AND I THINK IT'S HARD TO CHERRY PICK INDIVIDUAL ITEMS AND TAKE IT OUT OF THE WHOLE SYSTEM. THESE ARE LARGE BUILDINGS. IN ORDER TO GET THE EFFICIENCIES WE NEED, WE HAVE TO LOOK AT A LARGE COMMERCIAL HOT WATER AND HEAT AND I THINK PART OF THE PLAN GOING FORWARD IS TO LOOK AT HOW TO MAKE THEM AS ENERGY EFFICIENT AND CARBON NEUTRAL AS WE CAN, BUT AS A COMMUNITY, WE ARE NOT GOING TO GET THERE UNLESS WE HAVE A LARGE COMMITMENT TO COMMUNITY SOLAR AND OTHER SOURCES OF RENEWABLE ENERGY AND THOSE THINGS WILL TAKE THE FULL TIME THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE TO DEVELOP A PLAN. I THINK THE RESOLUTION IS DETRIMENTAL GOING FORWARD FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. CERTAINLY, WE ARE NOT GOING TO IGNORE IT OR SET UP A DOUBLE STANDARD BUT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS IN A BROADER CONTEXT. BY THE RESOLUTION THAT COUNCIL PASSES AT LAST MARCH WE HAVE TO INTEGRATE THIS INTO BOTH STRATEGIES IN THE FY-21 BUDGET INTO A LARGER PLAN THAT WOULD MOVE US FORWARD. I WOULD CAUTION YOU ABOUT TRYING TO BALANCE THIS ON EVERY PROJECT AND AS THE CITY AS AN ENTITY, WE WILL HAVE TO LOOK AT THINGS THAT WE CAN DO, AS WELL AS OFFSETS AND I WOULD APPRECIATE THE OPERATING SPACE TO DO THAT. ARE WE DONE WITH THIS AMENDMENT? OR ARE WE STILL ON THIS AMENDMENT?
02:07:59.289: >> Councilmember Bannister: WHEN WE ARE DO WITHIN THIS AMENDMENT, I HAVE A COMMENT.
02:08:08.398: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE AMENDMENT?
02:08:11.335: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU FOR THE SECOND OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. IT HAS BEEN MY EXPERIENCE WITH CITY GOVERNMENT, OURS AND OTHERS THAT IT'S BEST TO GET IT IN WRITING. AND I WAS RELIEVED THAT MS. HALL SUGGESTED THAT SHE WOULD CONSIDER THIS AND I'M SURE THEY WOULD UNDER OUR OTHER CHARGES TO HER. SHE DID SUCH A FINE JOB WITH THE WHOLE OF THESE PROPERTIES FOR CONSIDERATION. AND I THINK IT'S -- I WOULDN'T HAVE PUT IT IN THERE IF I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS IMPORTANT AND I DON'T WANT TO GET FIVE YEARS DOWN THE ROAD AND SAY, NO, WE GOT TO BALANCE THIS OUT BY DOING MORE PLACE ELSE AND SO ON. IF OUR PORTFOLIO OF CITY-OWNED PROPERTIES WAS FROZEN IN TIME, I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT OTHER OPPORTUNITIES AND CONSIDERATIONS THAT DR. STULTS HAS PUT INTO PLACE WILL BRING US TO CARBON NEUTRAL, BUT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT POTENTIALLY A DOZEN PROPERTIES HERE, ADDING TO OUR BUILD PORTFOLIO AND ADDING TO THE CARBON LOAD THAT WE HAVE TAKEN ON AS A CITY THAT WE HAVE TO MITIGATE. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT ANY TIME WE CONSIDER DEVELOPING ANYTHING, WHETHER IT'S AFFORDABLE HOUSING, WHETHER IT'S THE -- PLEASE NO TRAIN STATION, WHETHER IT'S WHATEVER IT IS. WE NEED TO BE EXPLICIT IN OUR GOALS AND CARBON NEUTRALITY. I APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT. IT'S CERTAINLY NOT TO TIMEY IN ANY WAY THIS RESOLUTION. I WOULD VOTE FOR IT WITH OR WITHOUT IT BUT I WOULD ENCOURAGE US TO VOTE FOR IT WITH IT.
02:09:43.794: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
02:09:44.728: >> Councilmember Grand: I THINK THE RESPONSE I HEARD FROM MS. HALL WAS SHE COULD GIVE US THE OPTION OF WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE ALLO ALONGSIDE OTHER OPTIONS AND THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN SHOULD BE DESIGNED AND BUILT. I WOULD LOOK AT THIS AS AN OPTION, WHERE IT SAYS SHOULD BE DESIGNED AND BUILT. AND MY FEAR IS IF WE PASS THIS, THAT IT COULD JUST BE ANOTHER IMPEDIMENT TO GETTING THE HOUSING DONE. WELL, NICE TRY BUT IT'S ONLY, LIKE 70% CARBON NEUTRAL AND NOT 100% CARBONNEAU ELECTRICITY. I WORRY -- CARBON NEUTRAL. I WORLEY ABOUT THIS. I FEEL -- I FEEL THE PUSH AND PULL ON BOTH SIDES OF THESE VERY IMPORTANT ISSUES. I JUST HAVE SEEN SO MANY EXCUSES NOT TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND I JUST DON'T WANT US AS A COUNCIL TO HAMSTRING OURSELVES AND GIVE US, YOU KNOW, ANOTHER ONE. I WOULD LOVE TO SEE SOMETHING -- AND I THINK IF IT DOESN'T GO THROUGH TODAY, WE BRING IT UP AT THE WORK SESSION IN JANUARY, WHERE I THINK INSTEAD OF POSTPONING WHICH I WILL DEFINITELY VOTE AGAINST, THAT WE CAN TALK ABOUT THESE KINDS OF DETAILS AT THAT WORK SESSION. I THINK THAT'S A GREAT PLACE TO HAMMER SOME OF THOSE OUT, WHAT IT WOULD LIKE TO BE PRESENTED WITH AS OPTIONS TO WEIGH THOSE TRADEOFFS AS OPPOSED TO JUST AYE OR NAY. I WOULD HATE TO SEE THIS, YOU KNOW, BE SOMETHING THAT CAN'T GET US THERE.
02:11:17.254: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
02:11:20.190: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: SORRY TO EXTEND THE CONVERSATION. I KNOW WE DECLARED A CLIMATE EMERGENCY LAST MONTH AND WE HAVE UNTIL NEXT YEAR IN MARCH TO SEE WHAT THAT WILL LOOK LIKE, WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO DO. BUT BY DECLARING THAT, THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT EVERYTHING THAT WE GO TO SET TO DO, IS GOING TO FALL IN LINE WITH THAT NECESSARILY. I MEAN IF THAT IS THE CASE, THEN ARE WE GOING TO MANDATE EVERYTHING THAT GETS DONE IN THIS CITY GOING FORWARD BE CARBON NEUTRAL? ARE WE GOING TO MANDATE ALL THE SINGLE-FAMILY HOUSING BEING ALL THE HIGH-RISES, ALL THE BUSINESSES, EVERYTHING THAT WE DO, ALL THE BUSINESS THAT WE CAN CONDUCT IN OUR CITY, ARE WE GOING TO START MANDATING THAT ON EVERYTHING THAT WE DO? IT SEEMS LIKE THAT THERE'S WHAT THIS DISCUSSION IS TELLING US THAT WE NEED TO DO AND WE ARE GOING TO PUT THE COST OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON THE PEOPLE WHO CAN LEAST AFFORD IT. YOU KNOW, PEOPLE THAT NEED HOUSING. THE HOUSING INSECURE. WE ARE GOING TO SAY, YEAH, YOU ARE GOING TO GET PUNISHED FOR THIS -- YOU ARE GOING TO BE TAXED TO SOLVE OUR CLIMATE CRISIS. THAT'S KIND OF WHAT I HEAR WHEN THIS IS GOING ON. SO I JUST WANT TO PUT THIS OUT THERE THAT ARE WE GOING TO START TELLING THIS TO EVERYTHING THAT GETS BILGETS BUILT AND HOW WE DO BUSINESS IN OUR CITY. IF WE LOOK AT, IT THAT COULD BE INTERPRETED BY SOME OF THIS DISCUSSION. THANK YOU.
02:12:59.923: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE AMENDMENT. ROLL CALL, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
02:13:06.263: >> Councilmember Grand: NO.
02:13:06.863: >> Councilmember Ackerman: NO.
02:13:11.301: >> Mayor Taylor: NO.
02:13:11.768: >> Councilmember Eaton: YES.
02:13:12.369: >> Councilmember Nelson: SORRY, YES.
02:13:15.372: >> Councilmember Smith: NO.
02:13:15.972: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  NO.
02:13:18.742: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES.
02:13:19.376: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES.
02:13:21.044: >> Councilmember Griswold: NO.
02:13:26.316: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES.
02:13:26.917: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION FAILS.
02:13:27.717: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN MOTION? COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER AND THEN COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
02:13:32.656: >> Councilmember Bannister: THIS MAY BE A QUESTION OR A COMMENT BUT I DID RECEIVE SOME FEEDBACK FROM RESIDENTS ABOUT WHETHER AN IMPACT STUDY HAS BEEN DONE ON HOW THESE DEVELOPMENTS PARTICULARLY THE ONE AT CATHERINE AND FOURTH, WHAT IMPACT IT WOULD HAVE ON ON THE WEDNESDAY AND SATURDAY'S FARMER'S MARK AND THE PEOPLE'S FOOD CO-OP. AND SO HOW THAT MIGHT -- HOW THIS DEVELOPMENT TAKING AWAY THESE PARKING SPOTS MAY HAVE AN EFFECT ON THE LOCAL BUSINESS AND THE FARMER'S MARKET. WE DID A FINANCIAL FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS. WE DIDN'T DO AN IMPACT STUDY ON ANY SITES. OUR THOUGHTS WERE DEPENDING ON HOW THE CONVERSATION WENT TONIGHT AND THE DIRECTION GIVEN BY COUNCIL AND CERTAINLY AT THE WORK SESSION IN JANUARY, WE WOULD BE ABLE TO ASSESS WHAT IT WOULD COST TO MOVE FORWARD, WHAT TYPES OF THINGS YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE HAPPEN. SO IF COUNCIL NE NEEDS AN IMPACT STUDY DONE ON CERTAIN ITEMS, THEN WE NEED TO PUT TOGETHER A BUDGET AND MOVE FORWARD ON THAT.
02:14:47.497: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
02:14:49.599: >> Councilmember Lumm: I WOULD LIKE TO DIVIDE THE QUESTION AND VOTE SEPARATELY, SINCE IT RECOMMENDS ACTION ON NORTH ASHLEY AND CATHERINE. I WOULD LIKE TO SEPARATE THE QUESTION. I WILL MOVE TO DIVIDE THE QUESTION.
02:15:06.383: >> Mayor Taylor: I DON'T KNOW PROCEDURALLY -- CAN I HAVE A SECOND TO THAT? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER? CAN WE DO IT BY AFFIRMATION? WE ARE GOOD.
02:15:18.962: >> Councilmember Lumm: OKAY.
02:15:19.563: >> Mayor Taylor: LET'S DEAL FIRST WITH --
02:15:22.599: >> Councilmember Lumm: WELL, I WILL SPEAK TO BOTH. [ OFF MICROPHONE COMMENTS ]
02:15:41.084: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU FOR DIVIDING THE QUESTION. I FEEL I CAN SUPPORT NORTH ASHLEY. I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT CATHERINE. SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CATHERINE AGAIN?
02:16:04.874: >> Mayor Taylor: 121 EAST CATHERINE.
02:16:07.677: >> Councilmember Lumm: THIS IS PLIES TO BOTH. THE RATIONALE THESE ARE THE HIGHEST PRIORITIES FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THEY ARE BOTH MANAGEABLE IN SIZE. THEY ARE NOT PROPERTIES THAT HAVE A HUGE VALUE IN TERMS TERMS OFALTERNATIVE USE. THE LOCAL DOLLAR REQUIREMENT IS SMALL. I SAID THIS BEFORE AND I STILL BELIEVE THAT IT DOESN'T MAKE ECONOMIC SENSE TO CONSTRUCT AFFORDABLE HOUSING ON THE CITY'S MOST EXPENSIVE VALUABLE PROPERTIES DOWNTOWN, AND GIVEN THAT, ONE OF THE STRATEGIC SCENARIOS, SCENARIO TWO, IN THE REPORT THAT WE RECEIVED AGAIN IS TO SELL THE HIGH VALUE AND THE DIFFICULT TO SELL CITY OWNED PROPERTIES. I DO THINK THAT STRATEGY MAKES SENSE. AND -- AND IN TERMS OF THAT STRATEGY, THESE TWO PROPERTIES SEEM RELATIVELY EASY TO DEVELOP. THE CATHERINE FOURTH SURFACE PROJECT, NOW WE HAVE 47 PARKING SPACES AND LOCATED AS HAS BEEN NOTED BESIDE KERRYTOWN, THE FARMER'S MARKET. WE HEARD FROM FOLKS WHO SAID THAT LOSING THOSE ROUGHLY 15 PARKING SPACES WILL ADVERSELY -- IMPACT THE FARMER'S MARK AND KERRYTOWN BUSINESS DISTRICT. I DO AGREE WITH THAT. THE FARMER'S MARK AND KERRYTOWN SHOPS ARE LITTLE ANN ARBOR JEWELS, AND I'M VERY CONCERNED THAT CONVERTING THAT PARKING LOT PLACES THEM AT SOME RISK. WE ALSO HAVE NOT REACHED OUT TO THE IMPACTED NEIGHBORHOODS AND LOCAL BUSINESSES, THE FARMER'S MARKET FOLKS. AND TO GET TO HEAR FROM THEM, AND I THINK THEY NEED TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH IN ON THIS. SO I -- AND I WILL JUST SAY, I WOULD BE LESS CONCERNED ABOUT THE LOSS OF PARKING AND MORE INCLINED TO SUPPORT THIS SITE AS AFFORDABLE HOUSING IF COUNCIL HAD APPROVED THE ANN ASHLEY PARKING STRUCTURE, BUT WE DID NOT. AND I WILL JUST BE HONEST, I WILL HAVE A HARD TIME SUPPORTING ANY OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT RESULT IN LOSS PARKING DOWNTOWN IN THE ABSENCE OF A PLAN TO REPLACE IT. THE D.D.A. HAS ADVISED US THAT WE SHOULD REPLACE THE PARKING CAPACITY THAT'S BEING LOST. I AGREE. AND BELIEVE IT'S A REAL ECONOMIC RISK TO REDUCE CAPACITY. FOR THAT REASON, I DO NOT SUPPORT RESURFACING THE CATH RIP CATHERINE PARKING LOT.
02:18:59.416: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION TO THE CATHERINE SITE.
02:19:02.619: >> Councilmember Hayner:  HAD THE CATHERINE SITE AND THE COUNTY PARKING LOT ACROSS THE STREET, I HAD A CONVERSATION WITH SOME NEIGHBORHOOD FOLKS, THE WORKFORCE HOUSING, IT'S MORE THAN JUST INSIDE THE -- THE FREE WAY RING. IT'S AIONAL ISSUE AND USUALLY WHEN WE THINK OF REGIONAL ISSUE, WE THINK WE ARE EXPORTING OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING STOCK TO IPSI AND OTHER AREAS. I KNOW THE COUNTY HAS EXPRESSED INTEREST IN THE CONCERNS WITH THE LACK OF AFFORDABILITY HERE IN THE CITY AND I JUST WOULDN'TERED IF THERE WAS ANY INTEREST IN CONVERTING THAT. HAVE YOU HAD ANY CONVERSATION? SORRY TO TURN MY COMMENT INTO A QUESTION BUT MS. HALL, IF YOU DON'T MIND ASKING. I SPOKE WITH COUNTY FOLKS AT OUR HACARBON NEUTRAL EVENT AND THEY SAID IT'S A REGIONAL ISSUE AND THEY WANT TO BE INVOLVES. THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT THAT SITE. TERESA GILOTTI IS WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION THERE AND HER BOARD TO BRING THAT FORWARD AS A NICE TO DO AN ANALYSIS ON. VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT WE DID WERE SITES. AND WE AGREED AS CITY STAFF TO HELP WORK ON THAT, WORK LOOKING AT ZONING AND THINGS LIKE THAT. TO ADDRESS YOUR CONCERN, THERE'S POTENTIAL LOSS PARKING RIGHT THERE, AS WELL AS THE BENEFIT OF MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES. BUT WE'RE NOT -- WE'RE NOT DOING THIS A VACUUM. ID TOI WANTED TO POINT THAT OUT.
02:20:43.987: >> City Admin. Lazarus: IF I COULD ADD, I SPOKE TO BOTH COMMISSIONER MORGAN, AS WELL AS COUNTY ADMINISTRATOR DUNNLY ABOUT THE PROPERTY ACROSS STREET, BUT ALSO THE PROPERTY AT ANN AND MAIN, AND THEY ARE HIGHLY DEDICATED TO ADDRESSING THE PROPERTIES THAT THEY HAVE AS OPPORTUNITIES FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE DOWNTOWN AS WELL.
02:21:07.377: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER SMITH. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
02:21:09.612: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I'M SET.
02:21:12.582: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER SMITH.
02:21:13.516: >> Councilmember Smith: YES, I THINK I COME AT THE PARKING ISSUE FROM PERHAPS A DIFFERENT ANGLE THAN SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES, WHICH IS YOU KNOW, I THINK WHEN WE HAVE THE CHOICE TO MAKE BETWEEN CAR STORAGE AND HOUSING, WE NEED TO PICK HOUSING AND THEN SOLVE THE CAR STORAGE PROBLEM AFTER THE FACT. I THINK THAT THIS PROJECT, YOU KNOW, THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT'S GOING TO TAKE US TO PULL THINGS TO GO, AND ACTUALLY GET MOVING ON IT, WILL GIVE US TIME TO ADDRESS THE CAR STORAGE ISSUE ADEQUATELY AND PERHAPS EFFICIENTLY WITH THE COUNTY AND POTENTIAL EXPANSION OF THE ANN ASHLEY DECK, BUT I BELIEVE THAT THE HOUSING PART AND APPROVAL NEEDS TO COME BEFORE THE CAR STORAGE APPROVAL.
02:22:05.168: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
02:22:06.035: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. AND THANKS TO MY COLLEAGUES FOR BRINGING UP SOME REALLY GOOD POINTS. AND I WILL AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE IN THE FIFTH WARD, THAT WE HAVE MANY DIFFERENT ISSUES, PRIORITIES ONE BEING PARKING AND ANOTHER ONE BEING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND I WILL TAKE AFFORDABLE HOUSING OVER PARKING IN THIS KEEP OF THINGS. IT'S -- HOUSING IS -- SCHEME OF THINGS. HOUSING IS A BIGGER NEED THAN PARKING. AND THE ANN ASHLEY STRUCTURE, IT WAS A SPLIT VOTE. IF THE D.D.A. WERE TO ADDRESS SOME CONCERNS THAT COUNCIL HAS, LD GET THE SUPPORT TO BUILD THAT EXPANSION. AND THAT HAS BEEN TOLD TO TAKE LESS THAN TWO YEARS. WE COULD BE DOING BOTH PROJECTS ON THE SAME PARALLEL TRACK, IF ONE GETS APPROVED, THE PARKING CAN GET  GET APPROVED AGAIN WITE ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED. I WANT TO HAVE A QUESTION ON THE VALUE OF THE SITE AT 121 EAST CATHERINE. WHAT WAS THE VALUE? WHAT WAS IT APPRAISED AT? [ OFF MICROPHONE COMMENT ] 1.19 MILLION. NOW YOU WOULD LEVERAGE IT AND HOW MUCH TO WORK WITH?
02:23:41.698: >> $1.9 MILLION.
02:23:42.098: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: DON'T YOU MULTIPLY THAT? WE HEARD SOME REALLY BIG FIGURES THAT WERE GENERATED FROM LET'S SAY $5 MILLION. WE HEARD SOME ASTRONOMICAL FIGURES.
02:23:55.211: >> RIGHT. SO THE SINGLE BIGGEST SOURCE OF FUNDING IS THE TAX CREDITS. CATHERINE AND ASHLEY ARE SUCH GREAT SCORING SITES, YOU MEAN ALMOST NO LOCAL SUPPORT. SO YOU MIGHT ONLY NEED -- YOU WOULD NEED SOMEWHERE IN THE RANGE OF $200,000 TO $1 MILLION MAX. LET'S SAY IT WAS $100,000 AND IT'S A $20 MILLION PROJECT, LET'S SAY. YOU JUST LEVERAGED ALL OF THOSE TAX CREDITS AND WHAT YOU CAN GET FROM A BANK IN A LOAN AND SO THAT SITE, YOU CAN LEVERAGE MANY, MANY DOLLARS WITH VERY FEW LOCAL. IF YOU SELL THAT SITE AND YOU HAVE $1.9 MILLION, AND YOU USE IT ON A SITE LIKE EAST STADIUM THAT WAS A $1 MILLION PROJECT BUT IT NEEDED $1.8 MILLION IN LOCAL SUPPORT BECAUSE IT CANNOT USE TAX CREDITS IN THE WAY WE WERE LOOKING AT IT AND NOT FOR HOUSING. AND SO SOMETHING LIKE THAT WOULD ENABLE YOU TO -- ENABLE YOU TO BUILD A SMALLER NUMBER OF UNITS, AT A LOCATION THAT'S HARDER TO BUILD, BECAUSE IT DOESN'T SCORE WELL WITH TAX CREDITS. SO THAT'S WHY WE PRIORITIZE CATHERINE AND ASHLEY. IT'S POSSIBLE TO SELL THEM, BUT IT'S NOT AS USEFUL THAT YOU CAN'T DO AFOR THIBLE HOUSING VERY WELL LIKE 721 NORTH MAIN. ANYTHING YOU CAN GET FROM 721 NORTH MAIN, IT WOULD BE HART TOO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING THERE. ITS A MORE USEFUL SITE TO SELL. LIKEWISE, SOUTH ASHLEY, YOU CAN BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING THIS BUT YOU CAN BUILD A LOT MORE MARKET RATE, AND SO SELLING A SITE LIKE THAT I WANT TO SAY THE APPRAISAL GAME IN AT $13.7 MILLION AND NOW YOU CAN SPREAD THAT ACROSS MANY, MANY SITES. YOU DON'T REALLY NEED IT AT ASHLEY VERY MUCH AND YOU DON'T NEED IT AT CATHERINE. THE D.D. AX PA. PRETTY MUCH WILE ABLE TO FEEL WHATEVER IS LOCAL ON THOSE TWO SITES WHICH IS NOT TO SAY YOU KNOW, IF COUNCIL DOESN'T WANT TO GO FORWARD ON ANY SITE, WHETHER IT'S CATHERINE OR ANY OTHER SITE, WE WON'T GO FORWARD ON THAT, BUT THAT'S WHY IT'S RATED HIGHEST.
02:26:19.689: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN, GRAND AND EATON, AND NELSON.
02:26:24.227: >> Councilmember Ackerman: ASKED AND ANSWERED.
02:26:26.329: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
02:26:28.598: >> Councilmember Grand: I SERVED AS THE COUNCIL LIAISON FOR THE HOUSING COMMISSION. ONE OF THE BEST PARTS IS I WORKED WITH JENNIFER HALL. YOU ARE A TREASURE TO OUR CITY AND I THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE WORK THAT YOU DO. IF, YOU -- YOU KNOW, HOPEFULLY MORE PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY, AND READING THIS REPORT HAVE A GREATER APPRECIATION FOR YOUR KNOWLEDGE, FOR YOUR PASSION FOR THIS ISSUE, BUT THAT THIS WAS -- THIS WAS ASKED AND ANSWERED IN A WAY THAT I THINK IS COMPREHENSIVE, BUT YET SIMULTANEOUSLY DIGESTIBLE AND EVEN COLOR CODED, AND ON THIS PARTICULAR PROPERTY, THE ONLY COLOR I SEE IS GREEN. TO ME, THAT SAYS WE PUT PEOPLE AHEAD OF CARS AND WE GO FORWARD. THIS IS BASICALLY GIVING UP A FEW PARKING SPACES FOR FREE HOUSING. YOU KNOW? IT'S AT NO COST TO THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING TRUST FUND. IF YOU SAY THE D.D.A. CAN COVER, THAT THAT'S AN INCREDIBLE DEAL TO US AND OUR COMMUNITY AND HELPS US MOVE FORWARD ON THIS IMPORTANT GOAL OF PROVIDING REAL UNITS THAT CAN -- THAT CAN CHANGE THE TRAJECTORY OF PEOPLE'S LIVES. THAT'S WHAT AFFORDABLE HOUSING CAN DO, OFFER PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE CIVIC LIFE OF OUR COMMUNITY THAT THEY CAN -- THAT THEY CAN LIVE WHERE THEY WORK, AND THAT IN DOWNTOWN, THAT THEY ACCESS TO ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES, AND OTHER OPPORTUNITIES TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT LIFE INSTEAD OF SPENDING THREE HOURS A DAY IN THEIR CARS. SO THIS IS JUST -- I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH FOR THIS. IY? IT WOULD BE ASHAME IF ANYONE DIDN'T SUPPORT ANYTHING THAT'S ON CA-10 TO 16, BECAUSE THESE ARE LONG-TERM PROJECTS AND THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY THAT WE ARE BEING GIVEN TONIGHT TO REALLY MAKE IMPORTANT STRIDES BUT ALSO TO LISTEN TO OUR EXPERTS ON STAFF, LIKE JENNIFER HALL, LIKE TERESA GOILOTTI AND THANK YOU SO MUCH. I HOPE THAT MY COLLEAGUES REALLY DO SUPPORT WHAT YOU DO AND SHOW THAT WE VALUE -- WE VALUE HOUSING AND ALSO THAT WE VALUE YOUR EXPERTISE.
02:28:54.143: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
02:28:57.046: >> Councilmember Eaton: THANK YOU, MS. HALL, IF I MAY. SO WE HAVE A WORK SESSION FOR JANUARY 13th. WILL THE PARTNERS, THE COUNTY AND U OF M, MAYBE OTHERS JOIN US AND TALK ABOUT OTHER PROPERTIES OR WILL THAT CONVERSATION JUST ENCOMPASS THESE PROPERTIES? I CAN'T SPEAK FOR THE UNIVERSITY. I'M LOOKING AT TERESA BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHEN IT WILL GO IN FRONT OF THE COUNTY.
02:29:33.315: >> I JUST PROVIDED A PROPOSAL TO THE COUNTY LEADERSHIP TO LOOK AT THE THREE DOWNTOWN PARKING LOTS AND DOING THE EXACT SAME ANALYSIS. AND I ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU ALL FOR CREATING THE MODEL. THE COUNTY DOES MINIMAL BUSINESS IN DECEMBER AND JANUARY IS A WORKING SESSION. I DON'T THINK THEY WOULD CONSIDER A RESOLUTION UNTIL THEIR SECOND MEETING IN JANUARY. SO I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE WOULD BE MUCH TO ADD AT THAT PARTICULAR WORKING SESSION BUT I COULD ABSOLUTELY GET AN UPDATE AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THE COUNTY IS PROCEEDING OR WHAT THEIR TIMELINE IS.
02:29:59.842: >> Councilmember Eaton: THANK YOU. AND THEN I HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION. YOU DID A REALLY GOOD ANALYSIS OF THE COST OF THE VARIOUS PROPERTIES, THE TWO PROPERTIES THAT I DIDN'T SEE A COST ANALYSIS FOR WERE FOR THE Y LOT AND 415 WEST WASHINGTON. CAN YOU GIVE BALLPARK NUMBERS OF WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT AS THE ESTIMATED TOTAL DEVELOPMENT COST FOR THOSE TWO PROPERTIES.
02:30:23.265: >> I WILL ASK MARK NORMAN COME UP. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAD JUST CONVERSATIONS RECENTLY WITH THE FOLKS AT THE SMITH GROUP. I'M NOT SURE IF THEY GOT TO THE NUMBERS YET. IF YOU HAVEN'T, THAT'S FINE.
02:30:34.276: >> Councilmember Eaton: IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT IMMEDIATELY IN FRONT OF YOU.
02:30:36.312: >> I'M NOT WORKING ON THE NUMBERS. WE ARE GIVING CONSULTING TO THEM ON THE NUMBERS.
02:30:40.716: >> THE
02:30:45.321: >> Councilmember Eaton: THEY WILL USE THIS SAME MODEL?
02:30:49.091: >> YES.
02:30:49.358: >> Councilmember Eaton: SO WE ARE MOVING FORWARD ON THESE TWO PROPERTIES.
02:30:53.729: >> YES. THEY WILL HAVE PRETTIER GRAY BOXES OF DIFFERENT SIZES AND SHAPES AND SHOWING DIFFERENT DENSITIES AND DIFFERENT WAYS THAT EACH OF THOSE SITES CAN BE BUILT AND HOW MANY UNITS ARE ON THE SITES AND WHAT THE COST IS. I JUST HAVE NOT SEEN ACTUAL FINAL NUMBERS. AND WITH THE ESTIMATED NUMBERS FOR THE SMALLER PROJECTS, I'M GOING TO GUESS THAT WE CAN'T REALLY EXPECT TO DO SIX OR MORE OF THESE PROJECTS SIMULTANEOUSLY, IS THAT RIGHT?
02:31:21.824: >> WE PROBABLY CAN'T. WE CAN DO COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT SIMULTANEOUSLY. WE CAN DO SOME COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND MOVING FORWARD ON DEVELOPMENT OR GATHERING INFORMATION SIMULTANEOUSLY TO HAVE SIX OR TEN ACTUAL DEVELOPMENTS HAPPENING PROBABLY BUT NOT THROUGH THE HOUSING COMMISSION.
02:31:45.014: >> Councilmember Eaton: BUT THERE IS A COST PROCEEDING ON ANY OF THESE PROPERTIES IN THE MANNER IN WHICH THEY ARE SUGGESTED ON THESE RESOLUTIONS?
02:31:52.388: >> CORRECT AND SO, AGAIN, I THINK THAT IS A PART WE NEED TO HEAR FROM COUNCIL EITHER TONIGHT OR AT THE WORKING SESSION, WHAT DIRECTION YOU WANT TO GO WITH EITHER OF THE SITES AND IF THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS YOU WANT TO HAVE HAPPEN FOR THOSE SITES. IF YOU MOVE FORWARD TONIGHT AND SAY WE WANT TO MOVE FORWARD WITH CATHERINE AND ASHLEY, THAT'S JUST GIVING ME A DIRECTION. WE CAN TALK ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS AT THE JANUARY WORK SESSION, IF THERE'S ADDITIONAL THINGS TO TALK TO BUSINESSES AROUND THE KERRYTOWN AREA. WE NORMALLY HAVE TO DO THAT AS PART OF THE SITE PLAN PROCESS, BUT THERE'S SOMETHING ADDITIONAL, I CAN GIVE YOU COSTS ON WE WILL NEED TO DO PHASE ONES AND PHASE TWOS AND ALL OF THESE VARIOUS THINGS. I CAN TALK ABOUT WHAT WE NEED UP FRONT COSTS FOR AND WAYS WE CAN GET REIMBURSED AND WALK YOU THROUGH THE FINANCIALS OF THOSE TYPES OF THINGS?
02:32:49.778: >> Councilmember Eaton: YOU WILL HAVE EVER SO MUCH MORE INFORMATION IN JANUARY, THAN THIS EVENING? BECAUSE YOU WILL TELL ME WHAT OUR DIRECTION IS, HOPEFULLY.
02:32:55.351: >> Councilmember Eaton: THANK YOU.
02:33:00.122: >> BECAUSE YOU WILL TELL ME WHAT
02:33:04.726: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER NELSON?
02:33:05.661: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I THINK SOME OF MY QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN ANSWERED. I WANTED TO ASK MS. HALL. SO PEOPLE AT HOME DON'T SEE WHAT IS FROZEN ON OUR SCREEN IS THE SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS, THE LAST SIDE OF YOUR PRESENTATION, AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT SORT OF INTRIGUED ME WAS THE IDEA THAT THE PROPERTIES THAT WERE MORE CHALLENGED IN TERMS OF FUNDING OPTIONS THAT THESE RESOLUTIONS ARE PROPOSING THAT YOU ARE GOING TO PURSUE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT ON THEM, AND I WAS CURIOUS. I MENTIONED YOU WOULD HAVE TO DO A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF ENGAGEMENT AS PART OF THE SITE PLAN PROCESS. I GUESS THE MONEY IS THERE AND IT'S READY TO GO. I WAS THINKING, WELL, THEN YOU START THE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT. I GUESS MY QUESTION MAYBE WAS, HOW IS THE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT SUPPORTING A PROJECT THAT IS STRUGGLING TO FIND FUNDS? OR IS IN NEED OF MORE LOCAL SUPPORT? WHAT SATELLITE SECTION BETWEEN THE NEED -- WHAT IS THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE NEEDS FOR MORE FUNDS AND THE LOCAL COMMUNITY FUNDING PIECE?
02:34:20.769: >> I DON'T HAVE THEM CONNECTED. SO FOR THE ONES WE'RE SUGGESTING COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT, SOUTH ASHLEY, THAT WAS BECAUSE IT'S SO HUGE. IT'S JUST SO IMPACTFUL. AND WE WOULD REALLY LIKE TO HEAR VERY SIMILAR TO THE FORMER Y LOT, WHAT ARE -- WHAT IS THE COMMUNITY'S TOLERANCE FOR HEIGHT, FOR EXAMPLE? HOW DENSE. WHAT KIND OF HOUSING PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THERE. THE SITE AT PLAT AND SPRINGBROOK. THAT'S PURELY A HOUSING COMMISSION ISSUE. THOSE ARE PEOPLE I HAVE ALREADY BEEN WORKING WITH. WE ALREADY OWN THE SITE. THAT'S MY PLAN. I DON'T NECESSARILY -- IT'S GOING TO BE A HARD SITE TO FIND THE FINANCING, BUT IT'S SMALL. AND SO RELATIVELY SMALL GAP IN DOLLAR. THE HIGH UNIT. THE 721 NORTH MAIN. I DON'T SEE THAT AS THE BEST SITE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING, UNLESS IT'S MIXED IN WITH MARKET RATE BUT IT HAS SO MANY OTHER THINGS GOING ON AT THAT SITE WITH THE TREE LINE TRAIL PROPOSAL THAT IT SEEMS LIKE WE NEED TO HAVE COMMUNITY INPUT ON WHAT THEY WANT THE WHOLE SITE TO LOOK LIKE. AND THAT WAS IT. THOSE ARE THE SITES TO DO THE COMMUNICATION ORGANIZATION PART OF IT.
02:35:50.826: >> Councilmember Nelson:  721 MAIN THIS WAS A SITE THAT WAS DESIGNATED AS LET'S BUILD HOUSING THIS. I GUESS DVP IF THAT PARTICULAR SITE, IF THAT'S ACONE -- BASED ON YOUR PRESENTATION, IT LOOKED THAT WAY TO ME, THAT THAT WAS NOT PARTICULARLY CONDUCIVE TO BUILDING HOUSING. WHAT WOULD IT -- WHAT WOULD THE HOUSING COMMISSION'S ROLE BE IN ENGAGING THE COMMUNITY IN SOMETHING ELSE THERE? LIKE. I WOULD HOPE IF THE COUNCIL WANTS TO DO COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT, WE WOULD ENGAGE A CONSULTANT SIMILAR TO THE SMITH GROUP. THAT'S NOT A SITE I SEE AS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT OR USEFUL FOR THE HOUSING COMMISSION TO BE DEVELOPING. BASED OPEN THE DEVELOPABLE LAND WHICH IS A SMALL PART OF THE PROPERTY. IT LOOKS LIKE IT WOULD BE LIKE 25 TO 35 UNITS, AND SO -- AND NOT THE TYPICAL FIND OF FUNDING SOURCES. IT MIGHT BE A SITE WHERE THE COMMUNITY SAYS, YOU KNOW WHAT, WE JUST WANT THE WHOLE THING TO BE UNDEVELOPED, ALTHOUGH THEY WILL PROBABLY SAY THAT FOR EVERY SITE. SO WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. OR THAT THE HOUSING WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE, WE DON'T WANT IT MORE THAN THREE STORIES OR WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE A MIXTURE OF INCOMES OR WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE OWNER OR CAN WE TRY A CO-OP HERE BECAUSE THE COOPERATIVE IDEA IS -- IS LESS RISKY IN A SMALLER SETTING LIKE THAT, AND IN THAT LOCATION, THAN IT WOULD BE AT SOUTH INDUSTRIAL, FOR EXAMPLE. SO I THINK GETTING COMMUNITY INPUT ON THAT, AS WELL AS CITY COUNCIL, GETTING MORE INFORMATION, WE JUST DIDN'T HAVE A -- THIS IS LIKE AN OBVIOUS THING WE SHOULD DO. THAT'S PRETTY MUCH WHERE WE ENDED UP AT.
02:37:37.666: >> Councilmember Nelson: WELL, I WANT TO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THIS COMPREHENSIVE LOOK AT ALL OF THESE PROPERTIES. I THINK IT WAS A HUGE VALUE TO SEEING THEM COMPARATIVELY TO EACH OTHER. BECAUSE WE DON'T EVER HAVE THAT. WE HAVE ONE THINK IN FRONT OF US AND TO COMPARE PROS AND CONS IS REALLY HELPFUL. I THANK YOU SO MUCH.
02:37:57.986: >> YOU'RE WELCOME.
02:37:59.388: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCIL LUMM AND THEN PERHAPS WE CALL THIS A DAY.
02:38:02.824: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES. SO YOU TOUCHED ON -- AND I APPRECIATE COUNCILMEMBER NELSON'S QUESTIONS ABOUT WHY DID YOU DETERMINE THAT FIVE OF THESE SITES SHOULD BE DEVELOPED WITH COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT, TWO WITHOUT, AND THEN ANOTHER TWO STUDY FURTHER. FOR THESE TWO, I -- YOU KNOW, WHERE I STAND ON CATHERINE. ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS HERE, AS THIS MOVES FORWARD SHOULD BE DEVELOPED WITH THE CONSULTING, REACHING OUT TO -- AND GETTING FEEDBACK IN THE LOCAL BUSINESSES IN THIS LOCATION AND OUR FARMER'S MARKET BUSINESSES CERTAINLY. ALSO, I WILL JUST NOTE THAT -- I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN ANSWER THIS QUESTION OR NOT, THAT THE FLOODPLAIN ORDINANCE IS IN THE WORKS RIGHT NOW. I DON'T KNOW -- I GUESS A QUESTION FOR THE CITY ATTORNEY, I KNOW IT RESIDES IN YOUR OFFICE RIGHT NOW. I FOUND THAT OUT AT THE D.D.A. PARTNERSHIP'S MEETING LAST WEEK AND IT CAME UP AND ANOTHER COMMITTEE I SIT ON, IT WAS NOTED -- AND THAT WILL CERTAINLY AFFECT -- AND IT SOUNDS LIKE WE HAVE A SMITH GROUP REPRESENTATIVE HERE AND I'M NOT AWARE IF -- I DON'T KNOW IF THE SMITH GROUP, THEY ARE STUDYING 415 AND THE Y LOT, THOSE ARE STUDIES IN PROCESS, CERTAINLY 415 WOULD BE IMPACTED, WHATEVER RECOMMENDATIONS PROCEED FROM THAT STUDY. THEY WOULD BE IMPACTED BY THE NEW FLOODPLAIN ORDINANCE AND I'M AWARE THAT THEY HAVE NOT YET CONSULTED THE CITY, THAT THAT'S BEING UPDATED. ANYWAY, FOR THE CITY ATTORNEY, BECAUSE THAT ALL AFFECTS THE TIMING AND WE WILL HAVE THE A WORK SESSION? SESSION IN JANUARY. WHERE DOES IT STAND THE FLOODPLAIN ORDINANCE?
02:40:08.116: >> WE ARE WORKING WITH JERRY HANCOCK AND PUBLIC SERVICES --
02:40:11.286: >> Councilmember Lumm: AND I UNDERSTAND IT'S BEEN TURNED OVER TO YOUR OFFICE. HE W'S PROVIDED HIS REPORT.
02:40:16.358: >> WE ARE EXPECTING TO HAVE IT BACK TO HIM IN EARLY 2020, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PUBLIC SCHEDULE IS BEYOND THAT.
02:40:26.101: >> Councilmember Lumm: ABOUT YOUR JANUARY 13th WORK SESSION?
02:40:29.604: >> I CAN'T SPEAK TO WHAT HIS SCHEDULE IS AND WHAT HE'S DOING. I'M NOT SURE THAT WE WILL HAVE IT BACK TO HIM BY JANUARY.
02:40:35.210: >> Councilmember Lumm: THAT WOULD IMPACT ANY RECOMMENDATIONS ON THESE SITES, THAT ARE IN THE FLOODPLAIN AND THE FLOODWAY AND THE FLOOD FRINGE. I THINK THAT'S AN, IMPORTANT MATTER TO FACTOR INTO THE TIMING ON MY RECOMMENDATIONS.
02:40:54.329: >> I KNOW ON 415 WEST WASHINGTON, WE ALL HAD AGREED TO NOT HAVE BILLINGS IN THE FLOODWAY FLOODPLAIN, UNLESS -- NOTHING IN THE FLOODWAY, AND IF IT'S IN THE FLOODPLAIN IT WOULD HAVE TO BE ELEVATED. I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S IMPACTED BY THIS ANALYSIS.
02:41:15.050: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU. STATE LAW PROHIBITS ANY RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE FLOODWAY, AND THE CODE DOES ALLOW BUILDING INTO THE FLOODPLAIN, BUT THIS QUESTION FOR ALL OF US, WHETHER WE SHOULD FACILITATE BUILDING IN THE FLOODWAY. THERE'S CODE AND DOING WHO IS RIGHT BY A STORMWATER MANAGEMENT EXPERT.
02:41:44.713: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
02:41:45.614: >> Councilmember Griswold: THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING YOU HAVE DONE AND ALL OF THE POSITIVE STATEMENTS THAT MY OTHER COLLEAGUES HAVE ALREADY STATED THIS EVENING. I'M ALWAYS LOOKING FOR THE OPTIMAL DECISION, AND I'M WONDERING IF IT'S POSSIBLE TO PARTNER WITH THE D.D.A. AND HAVE PARKING OPEN THE GROUND LEVEL AS IT IS NOW ON SOME OF THESE SITES AND THEN HAVE HOUSING ABOVE THAT.
02:42:10.505: >> YES, THAT'S POSSIBLE.
02:42:11.973: >> Councilmember Griswold: GREAT. THANK YOU.
02:42:14.442: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION.
02:42:17.045: >> WHATEVER YOU WANT TO PAY FOR. WHATEVER THEY WANT TO PAY FOR.
02:42:21.082: >> Councilmember Lumm: CAN I FOLLOW ON THAT? I GUESS I WON'T.
02:42:24.219: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN MOTION? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER GRAND. I'M SORRY, THIS IS -- THANK YOU FOR REMINDING ME. ROLL CALL VOTE FROM COUNCILMEMBER GRAND WITH RESPECT EXCLUSIVELY TO  121 EAST CATHERINE. COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
02:42:48.944: >> Councilmember Grand: YES.
02:42:49.544: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES.
02:42:53.548: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
02:42:54.049: >> Councilmember Eaton: NO.
02:42:54.649: >> Councilmember Nelson:  YES.
02:42:57.185: >> Councilmember Smith: YES.
02:42:57.786: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES.
02:42:59.354: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES.
02:43:01.489: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES.
02:43:03.291: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES.
02:43:06.862: >> Councilmember Lumm: NO.
02:43:07.429: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION CARRIES.
02:43:09.197: >> Mayor Taylor: LET'S ROLL WITH 404 NORTH ASHLEY. IS THIS NOW A SEPARATE MOTION OR IS IT DIVIDING -- MOVED BY COUNCIL RAMLAWI. DISCUSSION OF C.A.1B. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
02:43:25.981: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I HAVE ANOTHER BRIEF QUESTION. SO MY UNDERSTANDING THAT BOTH OF THESE PROPERTIES, CATHERINE AND ASHLEY ARE -- BECAUSE THEY QUALIFIED FOR VERY LITTLE TO ZERO LOCAL FUNDING, THAT THEY WERE -- THESE ARE PROPERTIES THAT ARE DESIGNED TO BE UP TO 60% A.M.I.
02:43:44.266: >> CORRECT.
02:43:44.599: >> Councilmember Hayner:  SO IT'S BELOW THAT.
02:43:46.201: >> THEY CAN BE AN AVERAGE, AND FRANKLY, WHEN DO YOUR -- WHEN YOU HAVE A DESIGN BUILDING AND YOUR APPLYING FOR FUNDING, YOU NEED TO LOOK AT HOW YOU SCORE FOR DIFFERENT KINDS OF FUNDING AND SOMETIMES YOU CAN SCORE BY HAVING A FEW MARKET RATE UNITS. SOMETIMES YOU SCORE POINTS FOR HAVING SOME REALLY LOW INCOME UNITS AND YOU INTO ED TO LOOK AT ALL OF THAT WHEN -- YOU NEED TO LOOK AT THAT WHEN YOU GET TO THE POINT OF THE DESIGN.
02:44:13.461: >> Councilmember Hayner:  SO THAT WILL BE A SHUFFLE BUT. SO YOU MIGHT HAVE A COUPLE OF MARKET RATES VERSUS WHATEVER. SO IT'S A MIX.
02:44:21.803: >> YEP.
02:44:22.070: >> Councilmember Hayner:  AND SO ONE OF THE FOLKS WHO SPOKE AT THE PUBLIC HEARING AND I RECEIVED EMAILS AND QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS, IT'S DIFFICULT FOR FOLKS TO PUT A NUMBER ON. THEY WOULD PREFER THAT WE WOULD PUT A NUMBER ON THIS INSTEAD OF A PERCENTAGE. IF I DID THIS KIND OF BACK OF THE NAPKIN CALCULATION, 60% OF A.M.I., A SINGLE PERSON AND A SINGLE UNIT, 60% A.M.I. WOULD RENT FOR ABOUT $900 AND 80% A.M.I. FOR $1,200 A MONTH. IS THAT APPROXIMATELY CORRECT? I KNOW YOU HAVE GOT THIS STUFF IN YOUR CHARTS.
02:44:57.605: >> YES. THAT IS THE MAXIMUM THAT THE RENT COULD BE. SO TO ALI'S POINT, IF WE WERE TO BUILD -- AND HOWARD'S POINT IF WE WERE TO BUILD NET ZERO ENERGY, LET'S SAY WE DID GEOTHERMAL AND ADDED SOLAR AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS THERE'S A CAP ON HOW MUCH FUNDING YOU CAN GET FROM THESE SOURCES LIKE TAX CREDITS. SO THAT IS THE TYPE OF THING I WOULD BRING BACK AND SAY, OKAY. HERE'S -- NOW INSTEAD OF HAVING A $20 MILLION PROJECT, WE HAVE A $22 MILLION PROJECT, THAT $2 MILLION IS COUNCIL WILLING TO ADD THOSE FUNDS IN TO MAKE THE BUILDING -- THIS NET ZERO. WHY DOES IT HAVE TO DO WITH THE INCOME AND THE RENT? BECAUSE YOU ALSO COULD LOOK AT IT DIFFERENTLY AND SAY, THIS IS THE BUILDING WE COULD BUILD FOR $20 MILLION AND WE COULD HAVE LOWER RENTS. AND SO ALL OF THOSE THINGS COME INTO PLAY AND AFFECT WHAT KIND OF FINANCING YOU HAVE AND WHAT THE INCOME IS AND THE CLIENTS THAT YOU ARE SERVING. SO THE MAXIMUM FOR 60% A.M.I., ONE BEDROOM, ONE PERSON IS $1,063 BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE HAVE TO CHARGE $1,063. WE COULD CHARGE LESS THAN THAT TOO.
02:46:07.709: >> Councilmember Hayner: OKAY. THANKS FOR CLEARING THAT UP, BECAUSE, LIKE, WHEN I -- IT'S BEEN A WHILE, SINCE I RENTED, BUT $900 DOESN'T SOUND THAT FORWARDABLE?
02:46:18.953: >> EXACT -- THAT AFFORDABLE?
02:46:23.091: >> EXACTLY.
02:46:23.425: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YOU SORT OF SUGGESTED THAT WE SHOULD HOLD THE LINE SOMEWHERE, AND THE LINE SEEMS KIND OF HIGH TO BE HONEST, AND I KNOW HOURLY JOBS, THEY ARE STARTING AT $11.50, $15 IF YOU ARE LUCKING TO START OUT. THAT'S $30,000 A YEAR, RIGHT? AND SO THAT'S NOT A LOT OF MONEY. THAT'S NOT A $1,000 A MONTH APARTMENT IF YOU ARE ONLY SPENDING 33% OF YOUR INCOME ON RENT AND I SUSPECT MANY PEOPLE IN THIS TOWN ARE RENT POOR AND HOUSE POOR.
02:46:50.018: >> AND WE ARE MISSION DRIVEN SO I'M ALWAYS GOING TO TRY TO BRING OUR RENTS DOWN AS LOW AS WE CAN.
02:46:54.422: >> Councilmember Hayner: OKAY.
02:46:55.990: >> MM-HMM.
02:46:56.291: >> Councilmember Hayner: THAT'S WHY I WAS INSISTENT ABOUT THE CARBON NEUTRALITY BECAUSE THESE TWO PROJECTS ARE THE ONES WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY LOCAL DOLLARS GOING FOR. I THOUGHT WE CAN SPEND THAT LITTLE EXTRA BIT TO MEET OUR GOALS.
02:47:08.203: >> WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO.
02:47:09.804: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF CA-10B. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
02:47:14.676: >> Councilmember Lumm: A CLARIFYING QUESTION. IN YOUR DEVELOPMENT INFO, THE BACKUP SLIDE, YOU SAID IF IT'S 9% LOW-INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS THEY WOULD ALL BE AFFORDABLE UNITS BECAUSE YOU ARE PROPOSING -- YOU SAID THIS WOULD HAVE A HIGH LOW-INCOME TAX CREDIT, THE HOUSING TAX CREDIT SCORE. BUT YOU ALSO SAID IT'S H.U.D. AND D.D.A. FUNDING ELIGIBLE. BUT COULD YOU JUST EXPLAIN THAT 9% LOW-INCOME HOUSING?
02:47:44.439: >> YES, SO UNDER THE 9% TAX CREDIT OR THE 4% TAX CREDIT DEALS, THE -- IT USED TO BE THAT 60% OF MEDIAN INCOME WAS THE HIGHEST INCOME, AND RECENTLY IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS, THE REGULATIONS WERE CHANGED TO SAY THE AVERAGE INCOME CAN'T BE MORE THAN 60% A.M.I., AND SO IT'S SO COMPLICATED. IT'S EASIER JUST TO SAY THAT WE WILL DO 60% A.M. I. AND BELOW AND BECAUSE OF WE'RE MISSION DRIVEN, WE WILL TRY TO DO EVEN LOWER THAN THAT. SOMETIMES THE WAY TO DO LOWER THAN 60% A.M.I. IS TO ADD SOME HIGHER INCOME AND BALANCE IT WITH SOME LOWER ONES. SOMETIMES IF IT'S A REALLY GOOD LOCATION, LIKE THESE TWO SITES, YOU WILL MIGHT BE ABLE TO HAVE MA'AM MUM 50% A.M.I. THE PROPERTIES WE ARE BUILDING AT ALL OF OUR DIFFERENT PUBLIC HOUSING SITES, WE HAVE A MAXIMUM OF MOST OF THEM ARE AT 50% A.M.I. AND SOME ARE AT 60%, BUT BECAUSE WE HAVE PROJECT-BASED VOUCHERS MOST PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO LIVE THERE WHO HAVE AT 12% OR 20% A.M. I. AND SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT YOU ARE ALWAYS HAVING TO JUGGLE WHEN YOU GET TO THE DESIGN PHASE AND THE SIZE OF THE UNITS AND THE RENT LEVELS. THE WAY THAT YOU CAN SERVE THE LOWER INCOME HOUSES IF SOMEONE HAS A TENANT-BASED VOUCHER. YOU CAN HAVE THE RENT SET AT THE 50% A.M.I. LEVEL AND BECAUSE THEY HAVE A VOUCHER, THEY WILL ONLY BE PAYING $200 AND NOT $900. AND SO THERE'S DIFFERENT WAYS TO GET A VARIETY OF INCOMES IN THERE. WE CAN PROJECT BASE SOME OF YOU ARE VOUCHERS AT SOME OF THESE SITES BUT WE DON'T HAVE $1,400. WE DO HAVE $1,400 VOUCHERS WE CANNOT PROJECT 1,400 VOUCHERS AT ALL OF THESE SITES. THAT'S THE CHALLENGE.
02:49:35.483: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANKS.
02:49:36.117: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN MOTION. ROLL CALL VOTE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
02:49:46.094: >> Councilmember Grand: COUNCIL.
02:49:49.597: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES.
02:49:50.598: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
02:49:51.099: >> Councilmember Nelson:  YES.
02:49:52.867: >> Councilmember Smith: YES.
02:49:53.468: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES.
02:49:55.436: >> Councilmember H  YES.

02:49:58.740: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES.
02:50:01.209: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES.
02:50:01.909: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION CARRIES.
02:50:04.646: >> Mayor Taylor: CA-11, RESOLUTION TO DIRECT ANN ARBOR HOUSING COMMISSION TO PURSUE AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT OF 2000 SOUTH INDUSTRIAL. I WAS GOING TO ROLL UNTIL 10:00. COUNCILMEMBER EATON, SECONDED BY SMITH. DISCUSSION OF CA-11. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
02:50:24.332: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU. I ALWAYS THOUGHT THIS WAS A DECENT SITE AND I KNOW IT SCORED MIDDLING ON YOUR ASSESSMENT. SO I GUESS I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS AROUND THIS SITE. ONE IS, YOU SAID THAT WHEN YOU DID THESE ASSESSMENTS AND THEN, OF COURSE THIS APPLIES TO ALL OF THEM AND I WON'T -- THAT THEY BE REASONABLY -- THAT YOUR -- THE SCALING OF THE PROJECTS ON THE SITE WERE REASONABLY COMPATIBLE WITH CURRENT ZONING REGULATIONS. AND IS IT MY UNDERSTANDING THAT -- BECAUSE WE COULD DO A PUD AND GIVE THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT OF A PUD, THAT THEY NEED KNOT BEING CURRENTLY COMPATIBLE WITH CURRENT ZONING; IS THAT CORRECT?
02:51:11.212: >> IT'S UP TO COUNCIL AND WHAT COUNCIL APPROVES FOR ZONING.
02:51:14.048: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I HAD THIS QUESTION ASKED OF ME. ARE THERE ANY -- ARE THERE ANY CONCERNS ABOUT BEST PRACTICES ABOUT CONCENTRATING TYPES OF HOUSING IN CON A CERTAIN AREAS?
02:51:27.562: >> THERE, BUT IN ANN ARBOR, WE DON'T HAVE 1,000 UNIT LOW-INCOME HOUSING PROJECTS. WE HAVE RELATIVELY SMALL PROJECTS. I DON'T CONSIDER THAT CONCENTRATING POVERTY. I HEAR THAT COMPLAINT SOMETIMES FROM THE COMMUNITY BUT IT'S SUCH A SMALL NUMBER COMPARED TO A NEIGHBORHOOD THAT TO ME WE HAVE NEVER HAD THAT PROBLEM HERE.
02:51:52.086: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I APPRECIATE THAT. SO THIS WAS DEVELOPED AFTER FURTHER STUDY MOSTLY DUE TO THE DIFFICULTIES OF FINANCING.
02:52:09.203: >> MM-HMM.
02:52:09.504: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU.
02:52:12.106: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
02:52:13.775: >> Councilmember Eaton: I'M SATISFIED THAT WE WILL HAVE A GOOD DISCUSSION IN JANUARY WHETHER OR NOT WE PASS THESE OR NOT. I WILL VOTE TO YES ON THE REMAINDER OF THESE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CONSENT AGENDA ITEMS, ANTICIPATING THAT WE WILL HAVE THAT DISCUSSION IN JANUARY BEFORE STAFF DOES MUCH WORK ON ANY ONE OF THESE. SO IN HOPES OF MOVING ALL OF THIS FORWARD, QUICKLY, I HOPE THAT WE CAN JUST PASS THESE AND MOVE ON.
02:52:40.568: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
02:52:42.003: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: WELL, I DON'T FEEL THE SAME WAY, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO COUNCILMEMBER EATON. SOME OF THESE OTHER ONES HAVE MORE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THEM. THIS ONE HAS COSTS TO HIRE A CODEVELOPER, ARCHITECTURAL FIRM, AN ENGINEERING FIRM. AND THAT HAS ME ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW MUCH MONEY WE ARE TALKING ABOUT, THE TIME FRAME.
02:53:10.331: >> I CAN GIVE YOU A GENERIC RESPONSE, WHICH IS EVERY SITE NEEDS TO HIRE A DEVELOPER, A -- WE HAVE A CODEVELOPER IN EVERY SITE WE DEVELOPED SO FAR. WE DON'T HAVE, -- WE DON'T PAY THEM UNTIL THE DEVELOPMENT HAPPENS. SO THEY HAVE DONE A LOT OF UP FRONT WORK. THEY HIRE THE ARCHITECT AND THE ENGINEER, BUT THEY HAVE TO BE HIRED. WE SEND TO SHARE THE COSTS. ON THE OTHER SITES, THE PREDEVELOPMENT COSTS FOR THE SURVEYS AND APPRAISALS AND ALL OF THOSE KINDS OF THINGS, IT'S GENERALLY OUR PORTION OF LESS THAN $100,000 FOR ALL OF OUR OTHER PROJECTS. WHEN YOU GET TO THE DEVELOPMENT AND YOU GET THE CLOSING, YOU GET REIMBURSED FOR YOUR PREDEVELOPMENT COSTS SO IT'S ESSENTIALLY FRONTING THE MONEY TO DO THE DUE DILIGENCE, DO THE FEASIBILITY, AND TO DO THE PREDESIGN. A LOT OF THAT GETS COVERED BY YOUR CODEVELOPER BECAUSE THEY END UP HAVING TO GUARANTEE CONSTRUCTION. AND SO THEY ARE VERY INVOLVED IN THE DESIGN PROCESS.
02:54:10.191: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS AND I'M JUST -- ALWAYS A PART OF ME IS GETTING ME CONCERNED WITH OUR BANDWIDTH TO TAKE ALL OF THIS ON. WE GOT THE Y LOT. WE STILL HAVE 415 ON TOP OF THE TWO THAT WE JUST PASSED. SO HOW MUCH CAN WE DIGEST IN A CITY THAT'S GOT A REPUTATION FOR MOVING EVER SO SLOW?
02:54:31.746: >> THAT MIGHT HELP US.
02:54:34.181: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YEAH, I -- I APPRECIATE -- I APPRECIATE THAT -- I'M LOOKING AT HERE, AND THESE HOMES ARE 275 TO 385, AND I GOOD E GET IT TO E SUPPLY. I GOOD ETTA ARGUMENT. THIS IS WHERE I START TO -- I GET THE ARGUMENT. THIS IS WHERE I START TO QUESTION IF WE DO TOO MUCH. AND WHEN YOU DON'T DO TOO MUCH, YOU DON'T DO TOO MUCH. AND SPENDING A BUNCH OF MONEY IN ALL DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS, AND THEN MAYBE PERHAPS GETTING TO THE POINT WHERE WE START SPENDING GOOD MONEY AFTER BAD MONEY, AND JUST -- I JUST HAVE THAT KIND OF SCAR TISSUE WITH JUST GOING, YOU KNOW, FULL COURT ALL OVER ALL AT ONCE. I JUST -- I JUST -- I HAVE AN ISSUE WITH THAT STRATEGY.
02:55:31.906: >> FOR INDUSTRIAL SPECIFICALLY, IT DOES SAY -- RECOMMEND THE CITY HAVE THE ANN ARBOR HOUSING COMMISSION MOVE FORWARD WITH DEVELOPMENT. I SEE THAT SITE AS VERY DIFFERENT FROM CATHERINE AND ASHLEY IN THAT I DON'T HAVE A PLAN YET. I HAVE -- I WANT TO MAKE SURE THE HOUSING COMMISSION IS INVOLVED IN THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, BECAUSE WE ARE LOCATED THERE. WE HAVE A VESTED INTEREST IN BEING THERE, AND I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN DEVELOP A SITE WITH AFFORDABLE HOUSING BOND FINANCING. SO IF YOU APPROVE THIS PARTICULAR SITE, ALONG WITH ASHLEY AND CATHERINE, WE WOULD MOVE FORWARD WITH ASHLEY AND CATHERINE AND JUST SORT OF DO SOME MORE RESEARCH FOR INDUSTRIAL. IT IS DEFINITELY BEHIND IN THE QUEUE, IF THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE THINKING.
02:56:15.883: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: WHEN YOU SAY BOND, FINANCING -- AND I KNOW YOU ARE NOT CROSSING INTO THE MILLAGE LANGUAGE.
02:56:26.560: >> NEW YONO, NOT YET. NOT YET.
02:56:31.966: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  BUT THE ISSUANCE OF THE BONDS AND THE ISSUANCE OF THE DEBT IN ORDER TO DO THIS.
02:56:36.303: >> RIGHT. SO THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING ACT THAT'S CREATED THE HOUSING COMMISSION THROUGH THE CITY, ALLOWS EITHER THE CITY OR THE HOUSING COMMISSION TO ISSUE BONDS TO DEVELOP AFFORDABLE HOUSING, UP TO 80% OF AREA MEDIAN INCOME. THERE'S NO GENERAL OBLIGATION BY THE CITY. IT HAS A SMALL AMOUNT OF REGULATIONS COMPARED TO LIKE TAX CREDIT AND H.U.D. FUNDING. DO YOU HAVE INCOME CAPS AND YOU HAVE TO HAVE CERTAIN KINDS OF HOUSING STANDARDS. AND THE REVENUE BONDS HAVE TO BE PAID BACK WITH RENTS. SO WE HAVE NEVER DONE THAT. MISHTA DOES THAT AT THE STATE LEVEL BUT WE HAVEN'T DONE IT LOCALLY. IT HAS NOT BEEN FULLY FLESHED OUT IF THAT'S FEASIBLE. WE MET WITH BOND COU COUNSEL ANE CITY, AND HAD SEVERAL CONVERSATIONS. WE ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW THAT WOULD WORK AND COULD IT WORK.
02:57:26.854: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU.
02:57:31.992: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
02:57:32.993: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANKS, MR. MAYOR. THANKS AGAIN, MS. HAL HALL. I APPRECIATE YOU SHARING THE QUESTIONS AND THE CONCERNS AND FINANCING FUNDING OPTIONS. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, I WILL SUPPORT THIS ONE BUT I DO HAVE SOME RESERVATIONS AND I -- I GREEN STARS HE THAT AFFORDABLE HOUSING AT THIS SITE COULD MAKE SENSE. IT'S IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO TRANSIT TO RETAIL. IT'S NOT EXPENSIVE REAL ESTATE, AND IT'S NOT A PROPERTY THAT HAS A HUGE DOLLAR VALUE IF IT'S SOLD, LIKE SOME. OTHER CITY-OWNED PROPERTIES DOWNTOWN. BUT THE FACT THAT IT'S NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THE LOW-INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT FUNDING, DOES MEAN THAT THERE WILL BE A SIGNIFICANT LOCAL DOLLAR FUNDING REQUIREMENT FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT HERE, AND THIS LOCAL DOLLAR REQUIREMENT IS THE SOURCE OF MY RESERVATIONS AND CONCERN. YOU DID OUTLINE SEVERAL LOCAL DOLLAR FUNDING OPTIONS. SOME OF WHICH I COULD SUPPORT, AND OTHERS I WOULD NOT. THIS RESOLUTION, DIRECTS STAFF TO EVALUATE SOME OF THE LOCAL FUNDING OPTIONS. AND I BELIEVE THAT'S THE APPROPRIATE NEXT STEP. IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION I ASKED, IT WAS INDICATED AT THAT TIME RECOMMENDATIONS WOULD COME BACK TO COUNCIL IN SIX MONTHS TO A YEAR. SO I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT. I DO BELIEVE THIS IS A GOOD SITE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. I'M HOPEFUL WE CAN FIND AN EFFICIENT FUNDING MECHANISM. AND, YOU KNOW, I JUST IN GENERAL, I -- YOU KNOW, THE -- I WOULD JUST SAY THAT WE HAVE NOT YET HAD -- I'M GLAD THERE WILL BE SOME COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT MEETINGS SCHEDULED FOR DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE Y AND 415 WEST WASHINGTON BUT WE NEED A ROBUST COMMUNITY CONVERSATION ABOUT, YO YOU KNOW, HOW MUCH WEE GOING TO INVEST IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THE CITY OWNS A LOT OF PROPERTY, INCLUDING A COUPLE OF THESE PARCELS DOWNTOWN THAT ARE QUITE VALUABLE. AND WE ARE PROBABLY TALKING CLOSE TO $50 MILLION IN REAL ESTATE THAT THE CITY ACTUALLY THE TAXPAYERS AND THE RESIDENTS OWN. AND I RECOGNIZE WE ARE COMMITTED TO DOING SOMETHING SUBSTANTIVE ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUT THE QUESTION IS:  ARE WE GOING TO COMMIT THE FULL VALUE OF THOSE ASSETS, 50 MILLION OR SO TOWARDS CONSTRUCTIONING AFFORDABLE HOUSING? I THINK WE NEED THIS ROBUST COMMUNITY CONVERSATION. YOU KNOW, WE HAVE ALSO RECENTLY COMMITTED TO AN AGGRESSIVE CLIMATE ACTION PROGRAM, AND WE, OF COURSE HAVE LOTS OF OTHER UNFUNDED PRIORITIES. SO I JUST THINK THERE'S A -- WE NEED TO HAVE A HIGH LEVEL DISCUSSION ON PRIORITIES AND HOPEFULLY WE WILL HAVE IT AT OUR BUDGET RETREAT AND WE NEED TO HEAR FROM THE BROADER COMMUNITY AS WELL. SO I WILL SUPPORT CA-11 BUT WITH SOME RESERVATIONS.
03:00:49.156: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN MOTION. ROLL CALL VOTE STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.  ACTUALLY, I HAVEN'T HEARD ANY OPPOSITION TO THIS. ALL IN FAVOR OF CA-11. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. LET'S TAKE A SHORT BREAK.
03:14:23.469: >> Mayor Taylor: WE ARE LACK AFTER A SHORT BREAK, CA-12 RESOLUTION TO DIRECT CITY STAFF TO CONDUCT -- LET'S TRY THIS AGAIN. RESOLUTION TO DIRECT CITY STAFF TO CONDUCT COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AROUND DEVELOPMENT OPTIONS FOR ASHLEY/WILLIAM AND FIRST/WILLIAM SURFACE PARKING LOTS TO SUPPORT AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE CITY. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI AND SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER SMITH. DISCUSSION OF CA-12. COUNCILMEMBER RAM LAW?
03:14:48.862: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. I WILL BE BRIEF. I MAY HAVE TO SPEAK ON THIS TWICE AFTER I HEAR SOME OF THE POINTS THAT ANY COLLEAGUES WILL MAKE ON THIS ISSUE. THIS PROPERTY OBVIOUSLY SCORES EXTREMELY HIGH IN VALUE. IT'S A HUGE PIECE OF PROPERTY IN OUR DOWNTOWN. AND I JUST HARKEN BACK TO WHAT I JUST SAID EARLIER BEFORE THE BREAK. I KNOW WE WANT ALL HANDS ON DECK, WHEN IT COMES TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING, BUT WE START TO ENGAGE IN OTHER ENTITIES AND START LOOKING AT THINGS AGAIN WITH COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENTS, AND, YOU KNOW, I JUST WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT WHEN IT COMES TO THAT, WHAT THE COST RAMIFICATIONS ARE, WHAT TIME FRAME, WHAT KIND OF COSTS ARE WE GOING TO HAVE IN THESE FURTHER ENGAMENGAGEMENTS SO WE DON'T GED OF TUNNEL VISION WHEN IT COMES TO THE OTHER PROPERTIES. I FRANKLY THINK WE HAVE A LOT TO DIGEST ALREADY WITHOUT ADDING MORE TO IT. SO I WILL RESERVE THE REST OF MY TIME TO HEAR, PERHAPS SOME OF THE, YOU KNOW -- I WOULD ASK THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR AT THIS POINT WHAT KIND OF COSTS ARE WE GOING TO LOOK AT? WHAT KIND OF IF MANY COMMITMENT ARE WE MAKING WITH THIS?
03:16:11.311: >> City Admin. Lazarus: I WOULD LIKE TO RESPOND. COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT FOLLOWS ON THE COMMUNITY ENGA ENGAGEMENT OE W LOT AND 415 WEST WASHINGTON WITH THE GOAL OF LEARNING FROM OUR LESSONS IN THE PAST AND GOING THROUGH ENGAGEMENT, IF THERE'S A CHANGE IN ZONING THAT'S REQUIRED. TO DO THAT ALL BEFORE WE BRING A DEVELOPER ON, SO THAT WE DON'T EXTEND THE PROCESS LATER, AND WE DON'T WIND UP WITH A DEVELOPER THAT CAN'T EVENTUALLY BUILD A PROJECT. IT ALSO GIVES US THE OPTION OF HAVING THE HOUSING COMMISSION SERVE AS THE DEVELOPER AND BRING IN A DESIGN BUILDER FOR A FEE. SO IT KEEPS THE OPTIONS AND THE GENERAL COST IS $75,000 EACH, IS WHAT WE PAID FOR 415 AND THEN FOR THE THE Y LOT. ANOTHER ADVANTAGE OF DOING IT THAT WAY, IF THERE IS AN ENTITLEMENT CHANGE AND INCREASE IN THE VALUE OF THE PROPERTY, WE BENEFIT FROM THAT AS OPPOSED TO A DEVELOPER. I THINK IT GETS YOU A BETTER PARTNER. WE KNOW WHAT WE CAN BUILD WITHIN THE COMMUNITY TOLERANCE BEFORE WE GO DOWN THE TIME CONSUMING AND EXPENSIVE PATH. WE DON'T WIND UP PAYING A DEVELOPER FOR AI LOT OF GYRATIONS TO GET THROUGH THE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT PROCESS LATER. SO I THINK WHAT YOU WILL SEE PROVEN AS AN ADVANTAGE  TO US BT GETTING THROUGH TO SAY YES TO THE PROJECT.
03:17:39.565: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: WHERE WILL THE MONEY COME FROM? IS THIS GENERAL FUND DOLLARS OR IS THIS?
03:17:46.105: >> City Admin. Lazarus: PART OF IT WAS PAID FOR FROM THE GENERAL FUND. PART OF IT WAS PAID FOR FROM THE D.D.A. FROM, FOR THEIR ALLOCATION FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING.
03:17:56.749: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  FOR THIS?
03:17:58.217: >> City Admin. Lazarus: THIS WAS 415. I APPRECIATE THE GENEROSITY THERE, BUT WITH THIS PARTICULAR SITE, WHERE IS THE MONEY GOING TO COME FROM?
03:18:05.458: >> City Admin. Lazarus: I DON'T THINK WE HAVE IDENTIFIED THE FUNDING SOURCE YET? SO WE WOULD CERTAINLY COME BACK TO COUNCIL WITH THE CONTRACT ANYWAY. WHAT THIS IS DOING IS REALLY GIVING US THE DIRECTION TO START THE PROCESS. ESSENTIALLY AS JENNIFER SAID, IT GIVES US, YOU KNOW -- IT GETS US PAST THE STARTING GATE, TO GO DOWN THE PATH TO BRING BACK WHATEVER WE NEED TO, TO COUNCIL TO GET THE EVALUATIONS DONE.
03:18:32.518: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF CA-12? COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
03:18:36.055: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANKS, MR.  MAYOR AND THANKS FOR ADDING THAT DETAIL, MR. LAZARUS. ALTHOUGH THE SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATION IS TO CONTINUE THE S STUDY AND I HAVE NO ISSUE WITH THAT AND I'M GLAD IT WAS PULLED OUT BECAUSE THE DECISION HERE INVOLVES THE KIND OF STRATEGIC DISCUSSIONS THAT WE NEED TO HAVE REGARDING ALL THE CITY-OWNED PROPERTIES, AND I THINK THE STRATEGIC OPTION FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT MAKES THE MOST SENSE FOR THIS PROPERTY, IN PARTICULAR, ASHLEY/WILLIAM, YOU KNOW, IT'S OBVIOUSLY ZONED D1. IT'S WORTH A LOT, ALMOST $14 MILLION AS A MARKET RATE DEVELOPMENT. THE DEVELOPMENT COSTS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE ANALYSIS PROJECTED THE COSTS AT -- EXCLUDING PARKING AT $136 MILLION. IT'S TOOIG FOR ALL AFFORDABLE HOUSING. YOU KNOW, DEVELOPMENT INFORMATION INDICATED THAT IT COULD HAVE 600 UNITS, POSSIBLY 125 AFFORDABLE UNITS AND 475 MARKET RATE UNITS AND 267 PARKING SPACE REQUIREMENT, AND THIS IS BY FAR THE MOST VALUABLE PROPERTY IN THIS PORTFOLIO, AND UNDER THE STRATEGIC SCENARIO, FROM STAFF, THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER, WHERE THE PROPERTY SOLD, AND THE PROCEEDS ARE USE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING ELSEWHERE, THAT CERTAINLY SEEMS LIKE A VIABLE POSSIBILITY THAT WE SHOULD CONSIDER FOR THIS PROPERTY, AND ONE THAT I BELIEVE WOULD MAKE A WHOLE LOT OF SENSE. AND THEN THE OTHER STRATEGIC CONSIDERATION FOR THIS PROPERTY, THAT THIS ONE RAISES, WE LOSE 144 PARKING SPACES IF THIS LOT IS CONVERTED TO DEVELOPMENT, AND THE D.D.A. AGAIN, HAS TOLD US THAT LOSING THE CAPACITY DOWNTOWN IS PAN  IS AN ECONOMICD PART OF THE REASON THEY RECOMMENDED EXPANDING THE ASHLEY STRUCTURE. SO I DO THINK THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE A SERIOUS DISCUSSION AROUND PARKING CAPACITY, AND -- AND -- BUT WE'LL SUPPORT THIS BECAUSE THIS IS JUST TO CONTINUE TO STUDY THIS, AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THE COMMUNITY DIALOGUE AROUND THESE VERY STRATEGIC ISSUES.
03:21:16.849: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF CA-12. ALL IN FAVOR. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. CA-13 RESOLUTION TO DIRECT THE CITY STAFF TO CONDUCT COMMUNITY ENGAMEMENT AROUND DEVELOPMENT OPTIONS FOR 721 NORTH MAIN IN SUPPORT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE CITY. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRAND, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER. DISCUSSION OF CA-13. ALL IN FAVOR,. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. CA-14, RESOLUTION TO DIRECT THE HOUSING COMMISSION TO CONTINUE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AROUND THE DEVELOPMENT OPTIONS FOR THE ANN ARBOR OWNED PROPERTIES AT 3432 AND 334 PLATT ROAD AND 3435-3443 SPRINGBROOK TO SUPPORT AFFORDABLE HOUSE. MOVED BY ACKERMAN AND SECONDED. DISCUSSION?
03:22:10.436: >> Councilmember Eaton: I HAVE A QUESTION. GIVEN ANY CONSIDERATION TO JUST OUTRIGHT SELLING THIS AND USING THE M MONEY ELSEWHERE?
03:22:21.914: >> YES. NO, YES. ABSOLUTELY, IT'S VERY ODD TUCKED IN SORT OF LOT. SO IF WE CAN'T FIGURE OUT SOMETHING THAT MAKES SENSE, THAT IS FEASIBLE BECAUSE IT'S A HIGH COST, LOCAL COST, THEN I WOULD SUGGEST WE SELL IT. SOMEBODY SHOULD DEVELOP IT, HOWEVER THEY DO IT. THEY MIGHT DO TWO SINGLE FAMILY HOMES. WHO KNOWS.
03:22:45.838: >> Councilmember Eaton: THANK YOU.
03:22:48.140: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF CA-14. INTEREST THAT SCENARIO TWO MAKES THE MOST SENSE. WE SELL THE HIGH VALUE PROPERTIES AND THE PROPERTIES THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO DO HOUSING IN ORDER TO PROVIDE FUNDING FOR EASIER SITES, EASIER TO DO SITES AND I'M SURPRISED THAT THIS ONE -- THIS IS ONE TO USE FOR HOUSING GIVEN THAT THERE'S NO INFRASTRUCTURE, EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE ASSOCIATED HIGH LOCAL SUBSIDY PER UNIT.
03:23:22.508: >> I TRIED TO BE POLITICALLY NEUTRAL IN THE ENTIRE FINANCIAL ANALYSIS AND THIS SITE, BECAUSE IT'S OWNED BY THE HOUSING COMMISSION, I HAD A REALLY HARD TIME LETTING GO WITH IT, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, BUT I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY WHERE WE WILL END UP AT.
03:23:37.657: >> Councilmember Lumm: OKAY. THANKS.
03:23:39.592: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
03:23:42.228: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION. I THINK DURING THE PRESENTATION YOU SAID THIS WAS PURCHASED WITH H.U.D. MONEY BACK IN THE DAY.
03:23:50.269: >> YES.
03:23:50.536: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  IT WAS NOT A DEEDED RESTRICTION --
03:23:54.040: >> I'M TRYING TO FIND THAT OUT TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.
03:23:57.843: >> I WILL NOT GO INTO A LONG DISCUSSION. I'M TRYING TO FIND THAT OUT.
03:24:04.383: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: IT'S STILL NOT CLEAR WHETHER WE CAN SELL IT OR WE MUST --
03:24:09.422: >> THERE'S NO RECORD FOR WHAT WE MUST DO WITH PROPERTY. I NO HE IT WAS PURCHASED WITH H.U.D. FUNDS AND I'M HAVING A BATTLE WITH H.U.D. ON A SIMILAR TYPE OF SITUATION AND NOBODY AT H.U.D. CAN GIVE US ANY ANSWERS BECAUSE IT'S IN CHAOS RIGHT NOW.
03:24:24.170: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I DON'T KNOW WHY. THANK YOU.
03:24:29.041: >> YEP.
03:24:32.211: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF CA-14. HAUL IN FAVOR. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. CA-15 RESOLUTION TO DIRECT THE ANN ARBOR HOUSING COMMISSION TO DETERMINE FEASIBILITY OF USING 1510 EAST STADIUM FOR TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT ANN ARBOR HOUSING COMMISSION OR OTHER CITY OFFICE SPACE. MOVED AND SECONDED. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
03:24:55.234: >> Councilmember Lumm: ON THIS ONE, I'M GLAD THAT 1510 EAST STADIUM IS ON THE SCENARIO TO SELL LIST. I'M INCLINED TO SUPPORT THIS ONE. AGAIN, IT'S A STUDY FURTHER AS WELL BUT DOES INCLUDE HIRING AN ARCHITECT AND THERE'S A BIT OF A COST. YOU KNOW, NOT A LOT AND NOT A BIG DEAL. BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT THIS ONE IS A STRONG CANDIDATE FOR SALE, AND USE PROCEEDS ELSEWHERE.
03:25:25.765: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. COUNCILWOMAN GRISWOLD.
03:25:29.268: >> Councilmember Griswold: GIVEN THAT THIS IS ON THE TRANSIT CORRIDOR, I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE THIS AS WORKFORCE HOUSING IDEALLY AND I THINK THIS WOULD BE UNDER UTILIZED IF IT WAS JUST FOR THE ANN ARBOR HOUSING COMMISSION. THERE ARE OTHER AREAS THAT -- WHERE THE LAND IS NOT AS VALUABLE OR WHERE WE CAN'T BUILD BECAUSE IT'S NEAR THE RAILROAD TRACK. AND SO I WILL BE VOTING FOR THIS BUT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE PERMANENT OFFICE SPACE.
03:26:01.267: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
03:26:03.769: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I ASKED A QUESTION TO THE AGENDA ABOUT THIS PROPERTY, AND I'M WONDERING IF THERE'S A -- A BETTER ANSWER THAT I GOT. I WAS -- I WAS INTRIGUED BY THE -- I SHARE COUNCILWOMAN GRISWOLD'S THAT BEING ON A TRANSIT CORRIDOR, THIS WOULD BE A PLACE THAT'S FABULOUS FOR THE PEOPLE TO LIVE. I WAS A LITTLE DISAINTEREST POOED WITH -- DISAPPOINTED WITH IT BEING CONVERTED TO OFFICE SPACE, BUT I WAS INTRIGUED BY THE IDEA OF IT BEING AFFORDABLE HOUSING -- OR THE ANN ARBOR HOUSING COMMISSION OFFICE SPACE, OR ANY OTHER CITY ENTITY AND I WAS WONDERING WHEN THAT PHRASE WAS ADDED, YOU KNOW, OR SOME OTHER CITY'S OFFICE SPACE. DID ANYBODY HAVE ANYTHING IN MIND AS TO ANOTHER CITY ENTITY THAT MIGHT WANT TO USE IT FOR OFFICE SPACE?
03:26:55.354: >> I THINK MY ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION WAS WE REALLY JUST RAN OUT OF TIME TO DO SORT OF AN ANALYSIS OF CITY SPACE NEEDS. I WOULD JUST -- THAT WAS IN THE RESOLUTION, BUT WE JUST DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO LOOK AT THAT.
03:27:07.933: >> Councilmember Nelson:  OH, BECAUSE IT HAD NOT OCCURRED TO ME THAT IT WOULD REQUIRE, LIKE AN ASSESSMENT OF ALL CITY OFFICE PEACE. I WAS JUST -- I THOUGHT -- OFFICE SPACE. I WAS JUST -- I THOUGHT INFORMALLY AMONG THE CITY DEPARTMENTS, YOU WOULD HAVE SOME -- I MEAN, BECAUSE WE RECENTLY HAD A CONVERSATION ABOUT THE ANN ARBOR PARKING STRUCTURE ABOUT THEIR PARKING REPUBLIC NEEDING A NEW OFFICE. I ANYWAY -- THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THAT.
03:27:35.694: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
03:27:37.530: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS. BUT I DO HAVE SOME PRESERVATIONS LIKE I HAVE HAD IN THE LAST COUPLE, BUT NOT ENOUGH TO SAY NO. THIS SEEMS LIKE A PROPERTY THAT WOULD BE BEST SUITED TO BE SOLD AND USED THOSE FUNDS TO BE USED TO ACCELERATE OUR OPTIONS IN OTHER AREAS. JUST SOMEBODY IN THE INDUSTRY, I SEE THIS AS A PROPERTY THAT COULD BE USED FOR COMMERCIAL USES. I MEAN, THERE'S -- LIKE, YOU COULD PUT IN SOME REALLY GOOD ASSEMBLY ONE USE TYPE OF ACTIVITY THERE, YOU KNOW, AND I THINK OF FIRE HOUSES. I LOOK AT THE ONES THAT ARE BEING REUSED IN DETROIT FOR ALL SORTS OF GREAT REASONS FOR THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY. AND SO I FIND THAT THIS VERY ATTRACTIVE TO SOME SORT OF COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT. JUST -- JUST THROWING THAT OUT THERE. THANK YOU.
03:28:35.020: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. CA-16, RESOLUTION DIRECTING THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR TO COLLABORATE WITH THE ANN ARBOR HOUSING COMMISSION TO PROVIDE COORDINATED ANALYSIS ON THE FEASIBILITY OF THE CITY-OWNED PROPERTY AT 353 SOUTH MAIN AS A POTENTIAL LOCATION FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. MOVED AND SECONDED BY RAMLAWI. DISCUSSION OF CA-16?
03:29:03.582: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: JUST AS ONE OF THE SPONSORS OF, THIS WE WERE ASKED BY JENNIFER TO INCLUDE THIS ON THE LIST AND TO EXPLORE MORE OPTIONS AND IT DOES NOT HAVE AN IMPACT TO THE COST OR THE TIMING. SO JUST ANOTHER PIECE OF LAND TO EXAMINE. AS WE TRIED TO INTEGRATE, YOU KNOW, THE FOLKS ON ALL PARTS OF THE SPECTRUM IN OUR COMMUNITY, I KNOW WE APPROVED RECENTLY, CATHERINE AND THE NORTH ASHLEY, AND WE'RE CREATING A VERY DENSE CLUSTER OF LOW-INCOME HOUSING IN A CERTAIN PART OF OUR TOWN. SO AS WE GO FORWARD, IT WOULD BE NICE TO SPREAD IT AROUND. THERE ARE CONSTITUENTS WHO BRING THAT TO MY ATTENTION AND BRING TO TO MY ATTENTION, THE CONCENTRATION OF THE LOW-INCOME HOUSING.
03:30:02.675: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
03:30:03.876: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THIS RESOLUTION IS GOING TO PUT THIS PROPERTY THROUGH THE SAME PROCESS AS THE REST OF THEM? HOW IS IT THAT SOMETHING THAT'S COUNCIL SPONSORED ENDS UP ON THE CONSENT AGENDA WHEN IT'S TYPICALLY RESERVED FOR STAFF ITEMS? I'M JUST CURIOUS? IS THAT AN ADMINISTRATE OF FUNCTION? ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE? ANYBODY?
03:30:29.568: >> City Admin. Lazarus: ALL OF THESE ITEMS WERE BROUGHT FORWARD BY STAFF.
03:30:35.841: >> Councilmember Hayner:  NOT THIS ONE.
03:30:38.844: >> SO I REQUESTED IT BE ADDED BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO STAY UNTIL THE END OF THE MEETING. I WANTED TO BE LIKE ALL TOGETHER, AND --
03:30:46.752: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I FUGGURFIGURED THAT WAS IT. I WILL WANTED IT TO BE MOVES WITH THE REST OF THEM.
03:30:57.129: >> City Admin. Lazarus: I STAND FIRM THIS WAS BROUGHT FORWARD BY STAFF.
03:31:05.471: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH US GOING THROUGH PROCESS, ITS HAD A TO PICTURE BECAUSE IT'S BEEN SO HOP FOR SO LONG AND SERVED AS A LITTLE LOT I KNOW SOME PEOPLE HAVE CALLED IT AS A POCKET PARK. I'M SURE PALIO ROOF TOP PATRONS WOULD BE LESS THAN THRILLED TO STARE INTO WINDOWS, BUT THAT'S THE WAY IT GOES.
03:31:24.156: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. BEFORE CLOSING UP, I GUESS I'M DELIGHTED THAT CA-16 AND ITS PREDECESSORS HAVE PASSED. OR THAT CA-16 AND ALL WILL PASS AND THE PREDECESSORS HAVE PASSED. YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY, THE NEED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS VERY REAL IN THE CITY. WE HEAR IT DAY IN AND DAY OUT AND WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE THE NEEDLE BY LEVERAGING THE CITY-OWNED PARCELS THAT WE HAVE ASKED STAFF TO WORK ON AND EVALUATE. THEY HAVE PROVIDED TO US A -- A GREAT LEVEL OF DETAIL. AND SHOWN US THAT WE DO HAVE PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITIES TO DO GREAT THINGS IN THIS AREA. AND I'M GLAD THAT WE -- I KNOW THERE WAS SOME TALK OF POSTPONING THESE ITEMS. I'M GLAD WE HAVE NOT DONE SO. I'M GLAD THEY WILL BE MOVING FORWARD. I'M MINDFUL TOO, THAT WE AS A CITY HAVE COMMITTED TO A 2030 PLAN, AN A2O0 PLAN AND I'M CONFIDENT THAT -- TO EVALUATE THESE PROPERTIES AND PLAN FOR THESE PROPERTIES THAT WE WILL DO SO WITH THAT GOAL FIRMLY -- FIRMLY IN MIND. ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. CA-19, RESOLUTION TO PROHIBIT ON-STREET PARKING ON BOTH SIDES OF BARTON DRIVE FROM LONGRE DRIVE TO PONTIAC TRAIL. I FORGET WHO PULLED THIS. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, SECONDED BY GRISWOLD. DISCUSSION OF CA-19. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI. OH.
03:33:00.452: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I MOVE TO HAVE THIS POSTPONED --
03:33:03.422: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. MY APOLOGIES.
03:33:05.290: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I MOVE TO HAVE THIS POSTPONED TO THE FIRST MEETING IN JANUARY. THERE SEEMS TO BE A LOT OF INFORMATION COMING FROM RESIDENTS THAT WARRANT A PAUSE AND FURTHER EXAMINATION.
03:33:20.739: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE A SECOND? SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER EATON. DISCUSSION POSTPONEMENT? COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
03:33:28.714: >> Councilmember Lumm: I WILL SUPPORT POSTPONEMENT. I -- I THINK THAT -- I MEAN, I WAS READY TO SUPPORT THE RESOLUTION, BECAUSE IT WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE INFORMATION THAT WE HAD REGARDING THE NEIGHBORHOOD PREFERENCE. THE RESOLUTION INDICATED THAT BIKE LANES ON BOTH SIDES WAS THE PREFERENCE OF BOTH THE PUBLIC MEETING SURVEY AND THE ONLINE SURVEY. TODAY, HOWEVER, WE HAVE RECEIVED SIGNED PETITIONS AND EMAILS FROM FOLKS WHO OPPOSE THE BIKE LANE PLANS. SO IT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME WHAT THE NEIGHBORHOOD PREFERENCES ACTUALLY ARE. AND WHILE I RECOGNIZE THAT SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES AND CITY STAFF WILL OPT FOR BIKES OVER CARS AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY, I'M STILL GUIDED IN THESE DECISIONS BY WHAT THE NEIGHBORS ACTUALLY WANT. SO I THINK PERHAPS IT MAKES SENSE TO GO BACK TO THE NEIGHBORS WITH ANOTHER SURVEY. I DON'T KNOW. BUST I WOULD DEFER TO MY FIRST WARD COLLEAGUES. I'M SURE THEY HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD PREFERENCES THAN I DO, BUT GIVEN THE INFORMATION THAT WE RECEIVED JUST TODAY, I -- I DO THINK POSTPONING MAKES A LOT OF SENSE. BUT IF WE DO, THAT I WOULD LIKE US TO GO BACK TO THE NEIGHBORS WITH ANOTHER SURVEY AND I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S DOABLE BETWEEN NOW AND THE NEXT MEETING. MR. HUPY, YOU ARE ACKNOWLEDGING THAT IT IS?
03:35:01.473: >> CRAIG HUPY, PUBLIC SERVICES AREA, ADMINISTRATOR. WHAT WAS THE DATE THEY WERE PROPOSING?
03:35:07.813: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  THE FIRST MEETING IN JANUARY.
03:35:11.883: >> THE SECOND MEETING IN JANUARY WOULD MAKE IT EASIER.
03:35:15.320: >> Councilmember Lumm: THEN YOU CAN DO ANOTHER NEIGHBORHOOD SURVEY?
03:35:17.356: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: OKAY. THAT WOULD BE GREAT.
03:35:19.691: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THAT FRIENDLY TO THE BODY? AS AN AMENDMENT TO THE POSTPOPEMENT? SECOND MEETING IN JANUARY. ANY DISCUSSION ON THE -- COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
03:35:32.704: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I APPRECIATE COUNCILMEMBER LUMM EXPANDING ON MY CONCERNS. THERE HAVE BEEN -- IN FACT, WE HAD RESIDENTS COME IN YESTERDAY DURING CAUCUS, SAYING THERE WERE SOME PROBLEMS WITH THE DEVICES THEY WERE USING TO RESPOND TO THE SURVEY. MANY PEOPLE HAD LEFT BEFORE THE SURVEY COULD BE COMPLETED. WE GOT PROTEST SIGNATURES TODAY. SO I JUST WANTED TO PUT THAT ON THE RECORD THAT THIS IS WHAT WAS BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION AND WHY I ASKED FOR THIS POSTPONEMENT.
03:36:08.573: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
03:36:09.574: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YOU SAY THIS IS DOABLE BECAUSE BARTON RESURFACING BEGINNING NEXT SPRING.
03:36:17.015: >> YES, ATHE THIS POINT, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT PAVEMENT MARKINGS. ON THE FINAL.
03:36:25.023: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I HAVEN'T SEEN THE DRAWINGS FOR THAT BUT MY ASSUMPTION IS THAT THERE AHE IS NO PLANS TO MODIFY THE CURB LINES OF THAT INTERSECTION.
03:36:34.299: >> WE ARE NOT CHANGING THE NUMBER OF LANES. WE ARE NOT CHANGING THE GEOPETTRY OF THE ROAD. THIS IS MARRYING UP THE LANES TO ALLOW FOR BIKE PATHS.
03:36:45.210: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WAS GOING TO MOVE A RESOLUTION THAT PROTECTED THE BIKE LANES WITH THE BULLARDS BECAUSE THE CONCERN THAT WAS EXPRESSED THAT THE ONLY TRAFFIC CALMING TOOL THAT IS AVAILABLE IN THIS SIX HOURS FROM MY HOUSE IS PEOPLE PA,INGPARKING IN THE STREET. THE INTERSECTION IS INSANE. THEY PARK THEIR CARS THERE PURPOSEFULLY AND LAWFULLY TO SLOW DOWN TRAFFIC. THESE ARE ONE OF THE TOUGH BALANCING ACTS THAT CONTINUOUS BIKE LANES WOULD SERVE ONE SORT OF POPULATION BUT MIGHT HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OTHERS. I EXPERIENCE THAT ON PONTIAC TRAIL AROUND THE OTHERS. LOTS OF PEOPLE USE THOSE LANES INCLUDING MYSELF, AND I APPRECIATE THAT THEY ARE THERE NOW, BUT IT CERTAINLY HAS DONE LITTLE TO CALM TRAFFIC ON PONTIAC TRAIL AND I KNOW THAT'S THE CONCERNS BEING EXPRESSED. I WILL SUPPORT THIS POSTPONEMENT, BUT WHEN IT COMES BACK, YOU CAN ALL EXPECT BETWEEN NOW AND THEN, I WILL BE ASKING THE RESOLUTION -- THE RESOLVE CLAUSES BE MODIFIES TO PROVIDE A SPECIFIC BIKE LANE THAT ADDRESSES THE TRAFFIC CALMING AT THIS INTERSECTION.
03:37:59.451: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE BOTH PONEMENT.
03:38:03.054: >> Mayor Taylor: ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT IS POSTPONED. CA-8, RESOLUTION TO EXTEND THE DEER MANAGEMENT PROGRAM WITH THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. MOVED AND SECONDED. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
03:38:35.887: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I HAD MANY OF MY QUESTIONS ANED DURING THE BREAK. I MADE A MOVEMENT TO GET THE MONEY TAKEN OUT OF THE BUDGET. I DON'T SUPPORT THIS DEER CULL. I CAN'T. LAST WEEK, I HAD THE PLEASURE OF SEEING THE -- FILM AT THE MICHIGAN THEATER CALLED "THE HUMAN EPIC" WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT EPIC, THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT A GEOLOGICAL TIME FRAME, AND THE CONCERN THAT THIS GROUP OF GEOLOGISTS HAVE EXPRESSED IS WE ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE OUR -- WE ARE EXTINGISHING THE RESOURCES AND CHANGING THE PLANET BEYOND THE ABILITY TO REPLACE ITSELF AND THE FOLKS WHO ARE OUT HERE SPEAKING ABOUT THE DEER POPULATION EFFORTS WOULD SAY THAT'S NOT CASE WITH DEER. THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO REPLACE THEMSELVES. AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO KILL THEM. AND I JUST DISAGREE WITH THAT. I THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK BEYOND THIS CULLING AND THE USE OF FIREARMS IN OUR PARKS AND THE MESSAGE THAT THAT SENDS TO FIND A BETTER WAY TO COEXIST. AND THAT'S ONE OF THE MANY REASONS I DON'T SUPPORT THIS ONGOING CULL EFFORT. ANOTHER ONE I KNOW MANY PEOPLE FEEL THAT THERE WAS A -- SORT OF A LITTLE BIT WEASELING AROUND HOW LONG WE WERE GOING TO DO THIS FOR AND IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE FOUR YEARS AND NOW FIFTH YEAR AND NOW THE WORD FROM THESE FOLKS IS THAT IT'S GOING TO BE ONGOING FOREVER. AT, YOU KNOW, 100 TO $150,000 A YEAR, SO HOW -- I QUESTION THE PRIORITIZATION OF NEEDS, THE EXPENSE, AND A LOT OF THINGS AROUND IT, AND ALSO THE MORAL AMBIGUITY WITH WHICH WE SEND THESE PEOPLE INTO OUR PARKS. I WANTED TO SPEAK THAT OUT AND I WANTED TO, YOU KNOW -- I WOULD -- I HATE TO WASTE MORE TIME, BUT I WOULD CALL FOR A ROLL CALL VOTE ON THIS. I WANT TO KNOW WOULD IS COMMITTED TO, YOU NO HE, TRYING TO LIVE IN HARMONY WITH OUR LANDSCAPE AND OUR FAUNA AND WHO ISN'T.
03:40:42.647: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? RAMLAWI, LUMM AND THEN EATON. I THINK LUMM FIRST.
03:40:47.886: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU. I BELIEVE CONTINUING THE DEER MANAGEMENT PROGRAM IS NECESSARY. OR WE'LL BE FACING THE VERY SAME DEER OVERPOPULATION PROBLEMS WE FACED FOUR YEARS AGO IN THE NOT TOO DISTANT FUTURE. WE CAN DEBATE A LOT OF THINGS BUT NOT ACC FACT THAT THE ABSENF ACTIONS TO CONTROL DEER POPULATIONS THAT HE THIS DOUBLE EVERY TWO TO THREE YEARS. AND PROFESSOR DICK NOTED THAT -- WHICH I FOUND WAS A STUNNING NUMBER, THAT HE TOUCHED ON THE EXPONENTIAL REPRODUCTIVE BEHAVIOR OF DEER, WHAT THEY OBSERVED AT THE GEORGE RESERVE, AND WERE IT NOT FOR THE DEER MANAGEMENT PLAN, WE WOULD HAVE OVER 1,000 DEER THAN WE HAVE TODAY. LIKE MANY OF THE EXPERTS, LIKE PROFESSOR DICK AND OTHERS HAVE BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION, I BELIEVE THAT ABANDONING THE PROGRAM NOW WOULD BE ILL ADVISED AND BOTH ENVIRONMENTALLY AND FISCALLY IRRESPONSIBLE. WE BEGAN THIS PROGRAM FOUR YEARS AGO BECAUSE THE ADVERSE IMPACTS OF DEER OVER POPULATION WERE REAL. AND THEY WERE SIGNIFICANT. THE PRIMARY NEGATIVE IMPACT WAS THE BROWSE DAMAGE TO THE CITY'S PARKS AND NATURE AREAS, ALL WHICH HAS BEEN WELL DOCUMENTED BY DR. CORTEZ. DR. CORTEZ'S STUDY HAS BROWSED DAMAGE ON OAK SEEDLING FOUND BROWSE DAMAGE IN ALL NINE PARKS AND FEATURE AREAS THAT SHE STUDIED THAT EXCEEDS THE 15 TO 30% LEVEL THAT PLACES FOREST REGENERATION AT RISK. CLIMATE ACTION PROGRAMMING IS NOT THE ONLY WAY TO DO THAT. SO IS MAINTAINING ECOLOGICAL BALANCE AND THE US IS STANABILITY OF OUR NATURAL AREAS. DAMAGE TO PRIVATE PROPERTY AND DEER VEHICLE COLLISIONS WERE ALSO CONCERNS. ALL THE CONCERNS WERE SUFFICIENT ENOUGH THAT U OF M PARTNERED IN OUR EFFORTS. NO ONE LIKES KILLING DEER. COUNCILMEMBERS DON'T. THE UNIVERSITY DOESN'T. STAFF DON'T. NO ONE LIKES SPENDING $150,000, BUT WE RECOGNIZE THAT ABANDONING THE PROGRAM WOULD BE A MISTAKE, THAT BOTH WASTES THE MONEY WE HAVE INVESTED SO FAR, AND TURNED BACK THE CLOCK TO WHEN THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS AND RISKS WERE TOO SIGNIFICANT TO IGNORE. I HOPE MY COLLEAGUES WILL AGREE WITH THE ADVICE OF STAFF AND THE EXPERTS WE HAVE HEARD FROM. AND CONTINUE THE PROGRAM THAT'S NOW CLOSE TO A MAINTENANCE LEVEL. THANK YOU.
03:43:26.945: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
03:43:29.481: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I'M BRAVE TO TALK ON THIS ISSUE. THE THIRD RAIL. BUT I WANT TO PUSH BACK ON MY COLLEAGUES' CERTIFICATION THAT THIS IS A VOTE -- COLLEAGUE'S ASSERTION THAT THIS IS AI VOTE THAT WE WANT TO LIVE IN HARMONY AND BALANCE WITH NATURE. I DON'T KNOW IF IT CAN BE FRAMED LIKE THAT. WE HEARD COUNCILMEMBER LUMM EXPLAIN THE BENEFITS AND THE PROGRAM WHERE IT IS TODAY. THE SCIENCE DICTATES THAT THE PROGRAM HAS DONE WHAT IT'S SET OUT TO ACHIEVE, AND IT'S BASED ON SCIENCE. AND THE FOOD THAT IS HARVESTED -- ANIMALS ARE NOT KILLED. THEY ARE HARVESTED. THEY ARE HARVESTS AND THE FOOD IS SENT TO FOOD PANTRIES THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY. SO, I MEAN, I WOULD RATHER SEE THAT DONE THAN A DEER GET KILLED ON HURON RIVER DRIVE AND JUST LEFT THERE FOR NATURE TO TAKE CARE OF IN OTHER WAYS. WE HAVE SEEN CAR ACCIDENTS DECREASE, AND BIODIVERSITY INCREASE. SO IF WE ARE AIMING FOR A BALANCE, THEN, YOU KNOW, I DON'T -- I DON'T THINK VOTING FOR THIS IS AT ODDS WITH BALANCE.
03:45:02.006: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
03:45:04.842: >> Councilmember Eaton: COUNCILE PLEASURE OF ATTENDING A LECTURE BY JACQUELINE CORTEAU, ABOUT THE IMPACT OF DEER ON OUR NATURAL E FACILITIES THAT WAS IN THE 4th . SHE DESCRIBED THE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT THAT OVER GRAZING HAS ON BIRDS AND POLLINATORS AND YOU ALLTHE LITTLE CRITTER. IT IS JUST SO STARK THAT HAVING TOO MANY DEER IMPACTS EVERY OTHER SPECIES, BOTH PLANT AND ANIMAL. AND DEER ARE PREY BUT THEY DON'T HAVE A PREDATOR WITHIN THE CITY AND SO IF WE DON'T ACTIVELY MANAGE THE DEER, THEY WILL CONTINUE TO BREED AS IF THEY DID HAVE PREDATORS, AND THEY WILL OVERWHELM EVERY NATURAL NATURE THAT WE HAVE IN THIS TOWN. IF WE DON'T DO IT THIS YEAR, OR NEXT YEAR, IT WILL JUST SIMPLY PUT OFF THE PROBLEM FOR A LATER DATE WHEN WE WILL HAVE TO ACTUALLY KILL EVEN MORE DEER AS DR. DICK POINTED OUT. THERE ARE A THOUSAND DEER THAT WE DON'T HAVE IN OUR CITY AT THIS MOMENT OVERCRAZING OUR NATURAL AREAS BECAUSE WE HAVE ENGAGED IN ACTIVE DEER MANAGEMENT. WHEN YOU ASK HOW LONG WILL WE HAVE TO CONDUCT DEER MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS, WE WILL HAVE TO CONTINUE MANAGE DEER AS LONG AS THEY CONTINUE TO BREED. IT'S JUST A BIOLOGICAL FACT AND SO I -- I DON'T LIKE GUNS. I NEVER HUNTED. THIS IS NOT MY FIRST RESPONSE TO A PROBLEM. BUT ACCORDING TO THE STUDIES DONE BY CORNELL UNIVERSITY, THIS IS THE METHOD THAT WORKS. EVERYTHING ELSE IS AN ILLUSION. SO IF YOU DON'T SUPPORT THIS, WHAT YOU ARE ACTUALLY SUPPORTING IS OVERGRAZING AND THAT IMPACT THAT OVERGRAZE HAS ON EVERY OTHER SPECIES IN TOWN. I WOULD HOPE THAT YOU WOULD CONSIDER THAT WE NEED TO LOOK FOR THAT BALANCE BETWEEN OUR CARE FOR CUTE DEER AND EVERY OTHER SPECIES THAT LIVES IN TOWN. THANK YOU.
03:47:37.295: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
03:47:39.931: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I'M LOOKING AT THE RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS TO THE AGENDA AND I THINK I HAVE A FOLLOW-UP QUESTION. THERE'S SOMETHING THAT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME. YOU HAVE AN OUTLINE COST FOR VARIOUS THINGS LIKE SHARP SHOOTING AND REPORTING SIGHT SELECTION FADING. IS THE HELICOPTER FLY-OVER, IS THAT THE SURVEY?
03:48:03.221: >> CORRECT.
03:48:03.554: >> Councilmember Nelson: OKAY. AND SO THE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WAS IF WE WERE TO TIP DEER MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES WE WOULD GO TO A TWO OR THREE YEAR CIRCLE FOR SURVEYS.
03:48:15.066: >> WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IT. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT WHETHER WE NEED TO DO -- THE SURVEY IS THE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT SURVEY OF RESIDENTS.
03:48:25.810: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I WILL THOUGHT IT WAS COUNTING THE DEER.
03:48:28.946: >> AND T TECHNICALLY BOTH OF THE THINGS WE REFER TO AS A SURVEY. THIS YEAR WE ARE NOT DOING THE RESIDENT SURVEY AT THE END OF THE PROGRAM. THIS YEAR WE WILL RECOMMEND DOING THAT EVERY OTHER YEAR BECAUSE WE HAVE THREE STRAIGHT YEARS OF DATA. THE HELICOPTER SURVEY, WE ARE DOING AGAIN THIS YEAR, AS PART OF COMPLETING THAT RESEARCH CYCLE UNDER THE FIVE-YEAR MDNR PERMIT AND THEN WE WILL EVALUATE WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE EVERY YEAR BEFORE WE TALK AGAIN NEXT YEAR.
03:48:57.608: >> Councilmember Nelson:  THE LAST FOUR YEARS, THE HELICOPTER DEER FLYOVER, DID THAT HAPPEN EVERY YEAR?
03:49:05.449: >> YES.
03:49:05.716: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I'M GLAD I ASKED THIS QUESTION. I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO STOP COUNTING THE DEER EVERY TWO OR THREE YEARS.
03:49:15.259: >> WE MAY HAVE THAT DISCUSSION, BUT WE ARE NOT MAKING THAT RECOMMENDATION YET.
03:49:19.730: >> Councilmember Nelson: THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THAT.
03:49:23.134: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
03:49:24.235: >> Councilmember Hayner:  JUST REAL QUICK. JUST TO SPEAK TO A COUPLE OF STATISTICS OR USED TO PROP UP THIS PROGRAM, WHEN WE TAKE THESE THOUSAND OF DEER OUT -- OR 150 DEER OUT WE ARE GIVING MEAT TO THE FOOD BRANTLEY. THEY DO 16,000 POUNDS A DAY. THIS MEANS VERY LITTLE TO THEM. SO THE FUNDING FOR THIS IS COMING OUT OF GENERAL FUND; IS THAT CORRECT? SO IT'S GENERAL FUND, FUNDING AND -- BUT OUR CONCERN SEEMS TO BE OUR PARKS. WHY ISN'T THIS COMING OUT OF PARKS BUDGET? WHY IS THIS MONEY COMING OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND IF WE ARE SO CONCERNED ABOUT OUR PARKS?
03:50:09.914: >> City Admin. Lazarus: SO A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE PARKS' BUDGET IS GENERAL FUND OF MONEY.
03:50:16.053: >> Councilmember Hayner:  SO IT'S SORT OF PART OF THAT.
03:50:17.989: >> NOT ONLY THAT THE REST OF THE PARKS OPERATING COMES OUT OF THE MILLAGE.
03:50:22.560: >> Councilmember Hayner: RIGHT.
03:50:23.294: >> AND THIS IS OPERATED ON MORE THAN JUST PARK-OWNED LANDS WHICH MILLAGE FUNDS ARE NOT ALLOWED FOR.
03:50:28.432: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I THINK THE FOCUS OF THIS, THAT WE MUST CONTROL THE DEER AND WE MUST BE THE PREDATOR, I JUST -- YOU KNOW, THIS BODY PRIOR AND EVEN UNFORTUNATELY SINCE I HAVE BEEN ON HERE, HAS APPROVED THE CLEAR CUTTING OF HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF ACRES OF NATURAL LANDS, FOREST LANDS WHERE YOU WILL ATHE LITTLE CREATURES LIVED. I WATCHED IT WITH MY OWN EYES AND ALL THE LITTLE CREATURES COME RUNNING ACROSS THE STREET. AND SO I WOULD JUST URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO EXPRESS THE SAME CONCERNS FOR THE URBAN CANOPY IN TOTAL THAT WE ARE EXPRESSING FOR OUR LITTLE BIT OF PARK LAND, WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THIS MOVING FORWARD, WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT APPROVING DEVELOPMENT ON GREEN SPACES VERSUS BROWN SPACES OR GRAY SPACES OR WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT, ALREADY DEVELOPED LAND, REDEVELOPMENT, YOU KNOW, REMEMBER THOSE CONCERNS THAT YOU ARE EXPRESS FOR THE BIODIVERSITY OF OUR PARKS. THAT'S WHAT I WOULD ASK. THANK YOU.
03:51:28.859: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
03:51:36.801: >> Councilmember Grand: YES.
03:51:37.401: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES.
03:51:41.339: >> Mayor Taylor: NO.
03:51:41.806: >> Councilmember Eaton: YES.
03:51:42.406: >> Councilmember Nelson:  YES.
03:51:44.675: >> Councilmember Smith: YES.
03:51:45.276: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES.
03:51:46.877: >> Councilmember Hayner:  NO.
03:51:48.245: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES.
03:51:50.348: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES.
03:51:53.317: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES.
03:51:53.918: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION CARRIES.
03:52:06.797: >> Mayor Taylor: CA-21, RESOLUTION AUTHORIZING THE APPROPRIATION OF 160,771 FROM THE GENERAL FUND TO REIMBURSE THE STREET, BRIDGE, SIDEWALK MILLAGE FUND FOR THE NORTH STEAM SAFE ROUTES SIDEWALK GAP PROJECT. MOVED BY MS. BANNISTER AND SECOND.
03:52:27.485: >> Mayor Taylor: I FORGET WHO WITH DREW THIS. COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
03:52:31.922: >> Councilmember Bannister: WE GOT SOME QUESTIONS AT CAUCUS AND RESIDENTS ABOUT WHERE THIS FIGURE CAME FROM, HOW DID WE GET UP TO $161,000. I WAS WONDERING IF WE COULD TALK TO STAFF ABOUT THAT AND CLARIFY FOR THE RESIDENTS.
03:52:49.573: >> CRAIG HUPY, PUBLIC SERVICES AREA ADMINISTRATOR, AND THE COST IS THE COMPILATION OF THE EXPENSE THAT WAS INCURRED BY STAFF, THE MEETINGS AND THE EFFORTS GOING INTO THESE TRAVER STEAM SIDEWALK. IT'S OFF OF OUR -- OUR EXPENSE RECORDS.
03:53:13.898: >> Councilmember Bannister: DO YOU KNOW ROUGHLY HOW MANY HOURS OR -- I MEAN, THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY.
03:53:19.303: >> WE COULD GO BACK AND PULL THE HOURS OFF THE TIME SHEETS. WE ARE DOING THIS OFF OF THE LEDGERS FOR THE DOLLAR A.M.S, WHAT WE CAN BACKTRACK EVEN DEEPER FOR HOURS IF THAT'S NECESSARY.
03:53:43.294: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
03:53:44.462: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: JUST A FOLLOW-UP ON COUNCICOUNCICOUNCILMEMBER BANNIS QUESTIONS. HOW MUCH OF THIS $160,000 OF WORK CAN BE REUSED FOR FURTHER DESIGN? I HEARD THAT THERE'S TALKS OF DOING SOME WORK IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD, THAT WERE LOOKED AT WITH THIS PROCESS. ANY IDEA OF HOW -- HOW MUCH OF THIS WORK CAN BE USED FOR PERHAPS LATER DEVELOPMENT?
03:54:19.396: >> PERCENTAGEWISE, I WON'T TRY TO GET. BUT ALL THE DESIGNS ARE VIABLE, DEPENDING ON W WHAT THE PUBLIC CHOOSES TO GO FORWARD WITH, IF THEY CHOOSE TO REVISIT IT.
03:54:31.642: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
03:54:32.610: >> Councilmember Hayner:  THIS STRIKES ME AS AN INTERNAL BILLING ISSUE. AND SO YOU ARE ASKING FOR YOUR DEPARTMENT TO BE MADE WHOLE FROM A GENERAL FUND BECAUSE YOU PUT THESE HOURS INTO IT AND THEN THEY WEREN'T PAID FOR BY THE ACCEPTANCE OF GRANTS; IS THAT CORRECT?
03:54:47.791: >> I DON'T LOOK AT IT AS A DEPARTMENT. WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT IS THE MILLAGE FUNDS, THE APPROPRIATENESS OF BILLING MILLAGE FOR CONSTRUCTION THAT DID NOT OCCUR. THIS IS MAKING WHOLE THE MILLAGE FUND WHICH IS INTENDED FOR THE DESIGN AND THE CONSTRUCTION. WHEN THE CONSTRUCTION DOESN'T OCCUR, THAT BECOMES A STRANDED OR ORPHANED EXPENSE.
03:55:17.555: >> Councilmember Hayner:  BUT THE DESIGN OCCURRED.
03:55:19.623: >> YES, BUT THE CONSTRUCTION DID NOT. AND THE MILLAGE IS INTENDED FOR THE DESIGN AND THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE PROJECT.
03:55:29.066: >> Councilmember Hayner:  IT HAS TO BE BOTH? IT'S NOT EITHER?
03:55:31.635: >> YES.
03:55:31.902: >> Councilmember Hayner:  SO YOU ARE ASKING FOR MONEY FROM THE GENERAL FUND BECAUSE THE STREET BRIDGE AND THE SIDEWALK MILLAGE FUND WHICH HAS $60 MILLION IN IT OR WHATEVER, NEEDS TO BE MADE WHOLE FOR THIS $160,000?
03:55:44.548: >> YES.
03:55:44.815: >> Councilmember Hayner:  NOW IF THIS PROJECT IS BUILT, NO MATTER WHERE THE MONEY COMES FROM TO REIMBURSE YOU FOR THE DESIGN ASPECT OF IT, WILL THAT DESEEN -- WILL THAT PORTION OF THESE FUNDS BE PUT BACK INTO THE GENERAL FUND AT THAT TIME?
03:55:58.596: >> GENERALLY WHEN THE GENERAL FUND SUPPORTS A PROJECT THAT HAS AN ASSESSMENT WITH IT, AND THAT'S WHAT THIS PROJECT DOES. IT HAS AN ASSESSMENT ON IT. THE PORTION OF THE RECOVERED ASSESSMENT THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH THE DESIGN CAN GO BACK, AND SHOULD GO BACK TO THE FUND THAT FORWARDED THE MONEY.
03:56:23.621: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I LOOK THROUGH OUR FUNDS LIST. WE HAVE THESE FUNDS AND SOME PEOPLE CALLED THEM BUCKETS AND THERE'S SOME CONFUSION ABOUT WHAT'S APPLICABLE TO WHAT. AND WE HAVE A LOT OF HYPNOGOGIC IN SOME AND VERY LITTLE IN OTHERS. WE HAVE PROJECT MANAGEMENT FUND, AND THE GENERAL FUND IS -- OH, MY GOODNESS, LIKE $106 MILLION OR SOMETHING. AND SO I JUST -- I'M NOT SURE I COMPREHEND THE S S SHUFFLING OF BILLABLE HOURS WHEN ALL OF THESE FOLKS ARE ON SALARY ANYWAY. I DON'T COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND IT. I KNOW ON THE CONSENT AGENDA, WE APPROVED TWO OTHER ONES WHEN YOU ARE ASKING FOR THE CONSENT, WHICH IS A CHANGE.
03:57:03.360: >> YES, IT'S CLEANING UP A WORKFLOW BUSINESS PROCESS THAT WE HAVE GOTTEN SLOPPY AT.
03:57:09.433: >> Councilmember Hayner:  SO THE EFFECT IS THAT YOUR DEPARTMES UNWILLING TO ACCEPT THIS LOSS BECAUSE THE PUBLIC DEPOSIT WANT IT AND WE VOTED TO SAY WE AGREE WITH THEM?
03:57:19.910: >> AGAIN, IT'S NOT THE DEPARTMENT. IT IS THE FUNDING SOURCE. WE ARE BEING TRUE TO OUR FUNDING SOURCES.
03:57:29.520: >> Councilmember Hayner:  WHEN WE DO OUR CAFR NEXT WEEK BEING I WILL HAVE MR. CRAWFORD BRING ME UP TO SPEED ON THE -- NO, I WILL TALK TO YOU AT YOUR CAFR MEETING. I APPRECIATE YOUR OFFER. WHAT'S THE HURRY, RIGHT?
03:57:48.672: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
03:57:50.074: >> Councilmember Lumm: I SUPPORT THIS, BECAUSE AS MR. HUPY EXPLAINED. THE STREET MILLAGE FUNDED THE MONEY FOR DESIGN AND PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT IN ANTICIPATION OF BEING REIMBURSED BY THE GRANT AND THE ASSESSMENTS, BUT THE PROJECT WAS ULTIMATELY REJECTED BY COUNCIL AND MILLAGE REQUIRES REIMBURSEMENT OF THE $160,000 IN COST FROM THE GENERAL FUND FUND BALANCE AND I THINK WE HAVE NO REAL CHOICE. THE MILLAGE NEEDS TO BE REIMBURSED AND THE GENERAL FUND IS THE ONLY FUND THAT CAN APPROPRIATELY DO THAT. WAS IT A WASTE OF $160,000? YEAH. I THINK IT WAS BUT WE HAVE NO REAL CHOICE HERE.
03:58:31.815: >> Councilmember Hayner: WELL, I THINK IT'S --
03:58:34.385: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
03:58:35.252: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I THINK IT'S AMAZING BECAUSE ITS SUCH A FEE BUT THE TWO THAT WE APPROVED ON THE CONSENT AGENDA WERE $15,000, AND $20,000 FOR A COUPLE OF BLOCKS OF SIDEWALK LENGTH ALSO. EVEN WHEN YOU DIVIDE THE TOTAL LINEAR FEET OF THOSE SIDEWALKS, IT'S LIKE WE ARE GETTING BUILT, $30, $35 A LINEAR FOOT TO DESIGN SIDEWALKS IT JUST SEEMS EXCESSIVE.
03:59:01.078: >> Mayor Taylor: THAT'S ONE OF MY CONCERNS. YOU KNOW, I MEAN, IT'S MY RESPONSIBILITY TO QUESTION OUR OPERATING COSTS.
03:59:12.089: >> I'M DRAWING A BLANK IN MY MEMORY AS TO WHY WE CAME BACK TO YOU. I EXPECT THAT WE ARE GOING -- IT WAS EXCEEDING OUR DESIGN MONEY AND HAD TO COME BACK FOR ADDITIONAL AUTHORIZATION.
03:59:30.240: >> City Admin. Lazarus: THIS PROCESS, THE STAFF PREPARED FOUR DIFFERENT DETAILED DESIGNS AND CONSTRUCTION DRAWINGS THAT'S A LOT OF EFFORT. THERE ARE A LOT OF -- MORE THAN THE NORMAL NUMBER OF COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND OUTREACH SESSIONS AS WELL. THERE'S VALUE TO THE DRAWINGS THAT ARE ON THE BOOKS IF WE EVER REVISIT THIS. SO I WOULDN'T SAY THE MONEY WAS ALL WASTED. I THINK ANY TIME YOU ENGAGE WITH THE COMMUNITY AND YOU GET TO AN END, THERE'S VALUE TO THAT, PLUS THERE'S A VALUE OF PRODUCT AT THE END. THERE'S ALWAYS LESSONS LEARNED AS WELL.
04:00:07.277: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND AND THEN GRISWOLD.
04:00:14.284: >> Councilmember Grand: I BELIEVE THIS WAS COVERED AND THE NUMBER OF TIMES THAT COUNCIL SENT IT BACK FOR ANOTHER LOOK. I THINK IF I ALSO RECALL MY COLLEAGUE ARE FROM THE 5 5th WARD CHARACTERIZED THIS PROCESS AS BANANAS. SO HOPEFULLY I TAKE THIS AS A LESSON LEARNED, PERHAPS FROM A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE ABOUT IF YOU ARE NOT GOING TO APPROVE A PROJECT, DON'T KEEP ASKING FOR IT THREE DIFFERENT WAYS OVER.
04:00:41.245: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
04:00:42.446: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES, I ALSO SEE THIS AS A LESSON LEARNED AND FOR A HISTORY IN JANUARY OF 2019, COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI WAS QUOTED IN MLIVE AS NEEDING A PEDESTRIAN EXPERT. WE TALKED ABOUT HAVING A VISION ZERO EXPERT, THAT POSITION WAS PUT IN THE BUDGET EFFECTIVE JULN THIS TO BE A NEGATIVE OF ANY TEAM MEMBER, BUT IT IS A CRITICISM OF OUR TRANSPORTATION TEAM THAT WE ARE LACKING THIS VISION ZERO EXPERT AND I BELIEVE IT'S PREMATURE TO TRANSFER THIS MONEY BECAUSE WE STILL HAVE A PROBLEM WITH ANN ARBOR STEAM. WE NEED TO GET THIS EXPERT IN HERE AND WE NEED TO COME UM WITH A SOLUTION THAT WE CAN ALL LIVE WITH.
04:01:37.534: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION?
04:01:38.669: >> City Admin. Lazarus: IF I COULD.
04:01:39.870: >> Mayor Taylor: I'M SORRY. PLEASE.
04:01:40.904: >> City Admin. Lazarus: THIS CAME DOWN TO AN ISSUE OF COST OF THE ASSESSMENT AND IT WASN'T A TECHNICAL ISSUE AND THERE WERE MANY WAYS COUNCIL COULD HAVE ADDRESSED IT AT THE TIME. I THINK COUNCIL WAS RESPONSIVE TO THE CONCERNS THEY HEARD, BUT, YOU KNOW, WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF HIRING THE ENGINEER, I WOULD GRANT THAT IT'S TAKEN LONGER THAN WE HAD THOUGHT IT WOULD, BUT I DON'T THINK WHETHER WE HAD ANOTHER ENGINEER ON STAFF WOULD HAVE MADE A DIFFERENCE IN THE END.
04:02:11.101: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCIL WOMAN GRISWOLD?
04:02:13.303: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I BEG TO DIFFER. I WILL TALKED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, THEY ARE PUTTING A SIDEWALK IN ON ONE SIDE OF THE STREET. I TALKED TO MDOT ENGINEERS AND THEY ALSO TALKED ABOUT A SIDEWALK ON ONE SIDE OF THE STREET.
04:02:26.917: >> City Admin. Lazarus: THIS WAS A PROJECT THROUGH THE SAFE ROUTE TO SCHOOL, THE MICHIGAN FILTERINGNESS FOUNDATION. THE REQUIREMENT -- FITNESS FOUNDATION, THE REQUIREMENT IS TO HAVE SIDEWALKS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE STREET. IT WAS A CONDITION OF THE GRANT.
04:02:39.496: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT IS WHAT WE ARE TOLD, BUT WHAT I BELIEVE IS THAT WITH A VISION ZERO EXPERT, WE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO WORK THROUGH THIS. I ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE ARE SPENDING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR ON PEDESTRIAN SAFETY INFRASTRUCTURE, AND WE HAVE NOT HAD A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN OUR CRASHES. WE HAVE A DESPERATE NEED TO GET THIS VISION ZERO EXPERT ON BOARD AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
04:03:06.123: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
04:03:16.800: >> Councilmember Grand: YES.
04:03:17.401: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES.

04:03:36.253: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES.
04:03:36.853: >> Mayor Taylor: WE NOW COME TO A SET OF PUBLIC HEARINGS. PUBLIC HEARINGS ARE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MEMBERS OF PUBLIC TO SPEAK TO COUNCIL AND THE COMMUNITY TO SPEAK TO COUNCIL ABOUT THE THE PUBLIC HEARING. IT MUST RELATE TO THE SUBJECT OF THE PUBLIC HEARING. SPEAKERS DO NOT NEED TO HAVE SIGNED UP IN ADVANCE. SPEAKERS WILL HAVE THREE MINUTES IN WHICH TO SPEAK. SO PLEASE PAY CLOSE TO ATTENTION TO THE TIME CLOCK. AS A MATTER OF COURTESY, WE MAY HAVE ONLY ONE PERSON SPEAKING AT A TIME AND FINALLY, IF YOU REQUIRE ASSISTANCE IN SPEAKING BEFORE COUNCIL TODAY, WE WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO PROVIDE IT TO YOU. PUBLIC HEARING NUMBER ONE. RESOLUTION TO APPROVE THE VIC VILLAGE SOUTH SITE PLAN AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT, 1100 SOUTH UNIVERSITY AVENUE. IS THERE ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING?
04:04:32.709: >> HI. SO I DID READ THE ATTACHED DOCUMENTS TO THIS ONE. AND TO HOPEFULLY MY KNOWLEDGE IS SUFFICIENT, BUT I'M ZACHARY STORY. SOME OF YOU MAY ALSO KNOW ME AS THE WEREWOLF PLAYING VIOLIN GUY DOWNTOWN. YOU KNOW, ANY HOUSING -- FIRST OF ALL, I WANT TO COMMEND YOU FOR PASSING, YOU NO HE, WHAT SEEMS LIKE THE FIRST AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS, YOU KNOW, EARLIER, BUT, YOU KNOW THIS VIC VILLAGE, YOU KNOW, ALTHOUGH IT IS HIGHER INCOME LEVELS, I THINK THERE WAS, LIKE, HOW MANY, 14 AFFORDABLE UNITS IN IT. WHILE I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE AFFORDABLE LOW-INCOME UNITS IN THE CITY, WHAT THIS WILL DO IS LOWER THE RENTS FOR SOME DISTINCT NEIGHBORHOODS, MAYBE IF MORE STUDENTS HAVE THAT HOUSING THAT'S CLOSE TO THE CAMPUS. LIKE, THE SURROUNDING NEIGHBORHOODS, LIKE FOREST DOWN TO -- YOU KNOW, DOWN TO -- WEST -- I CAN'T THINK OF -- YOU KNOW, THE STREET NAMES RIGHT NOW, BUT DOWN TO THE -- AT THE AREAS THAT ARE TYPICALLY, YOU KNOW, RUN BY LANDLORDS FOR STUDENTS, SO -- YOU KNOW, THOSE ARE PLACES THAT THE LOWER INCOME AFFORDABLE FOR PEOPLE IN THIS COMMUNITY. ALONG WITH THIS ISSUE, I HAVE -- YOU KNOW, THE THOUGHT POPPED INTO MY HEAD OF -- FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE I HAVE LIVED HERE NINE YEARS OF MOVING AWAY FROM ANN ARBOR. IT'S JUST NOT AFFORDABLE TO ME. MY CURRENT HOUSING SITUATION IS -- I FOUND OUT A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO IS ENDING IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS. SO I HAVE TO MAKE SOME DECISIONS, AND, YOU KNOW, WE NEED TO ACT QUICKLY TO GET, YOU KNOW, HOUSING STRAIGHTENED OUT IN IN COMMUNITY. YOU KNOW, IF IT'S GOING TO BE FOR EVERYONE, IT WILL BE BAD FOR PEOPLE WHO LOVE CARS, YO YOU KN? THERE IS PARKING -- I FOUND TWO LEVELS OF UNDERGROUND PARKING FOR THIS, RIGHT, AS LONG AS THE ACCESS ALLEY BEHIND -- SO, YOU KNOW, PARKING ISSUES SATISFIED, YOU KNOW, I FEEL FOR THE BUSINESSES THAT IT'S GOING TO AFFECT, BUT, YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES CHANGE IS PAINFUL, AND I THINK THIS WILL SERVE THE COMMUNITY. THANK YOU.
04:07:33.657: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING? SEEING NO ONE, THIS PUBLIC HEARING IS CLOSED. PUBLIC HEARING NUMBER TWO.

B, IS AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND CHAPTER 55 (ZONING), ZONING OF 0.106 ACRE FROM TWP (TOWNSHIP DISTRICT) TO R1C (SINGLE-FAMILY DWELLING DISTRICT) DURLING REZONING, 2625 VALLEY DRIVE. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER SMITH, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER NELSON. DISCUSSION, PLEASE, OF B-1? COUNCIL ME MEMBER HAYNER.
04:09:43.653: >> Councilmember Hayner:  THIS COMMENT WILL PROBABLY APPLY TO ALL OF THESE. SO THESE REZONINGS COME BEFORE US AFTER ANNEXATION AND THEY ARE INITIATED BY THE OWNER OR THE PETITIONER AND THEY HAVE ASKED FOR THIS TYPE OF REZONING? SO -- AS PART OF THE ANNEXATION, RIGHT? AND SO I JUST -- MY QUESTION IS, ARE WE -- AND I KNOW EACH ONE OF THESE IS DIFFERENT. BUT ARE THESE PARCELS, YOU KNOW, SOME ARE BIGGER THAN OTHERS. ARE WE IN ANY WAY SUGGESTING TO THESE FOLKS THAT R-2 TYPE SITUATION MAY BE MORE IN KEEPING WITH OUR DESIRES TO BUILD MORE UNITS HERE IN THE CITY? DO WE DO THAT?
04:10:28.231: >> GOOD EVENING, BRENT LEINART. TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, THEY INITIATED BY THE PROPERTY OWNERS, OFTEN TO CONNECT WITH CITY UTILITY SERVICES DUE TO SOME FAILURE THAT THEY HAVE. THEY PA APPLY TO ANNEXATION AND ZONING AT THE SAME TIME. WE TALK TO THEM ABOUT WHAT THE APPROPRIATE ZONING DESIGNATION IS AND MOST TYPICALLY THE ZONING THAT THEY PROPOSE AND WE CONSIDER IS CONSISTENT WITH THE SURROUNDING LAND USE. AND SO IN THE CASE OF THESE WHERE THEY ARE SURROUNDED BY COMPARABLE R1 ZONING WE TYPICALLY WOULDN'T ASK STAFF, WE SUGGEST THAT THEY GO TO R2?
04:11:08.304: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I KNOW WE LOOKED AT WAYS TO NATURAL INCREASE DENSITY HON EXISTING PARCELS. IF WE MAKE SOME VERY SMALL CHANGES TO THE, YOU KNOW, R2 OR WHATEVER TO CHANGE THE SETBACKS AND THE LIMITS AND STUFF AND THE SAME WITH THE R1 ZONINGS THAT WE WOULD FIND MORE PEOPLE DEVELOP MORE DENSELY IN THE CURRENT FORMATION. MAYBE THAT'S SOMETHING THAT COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN AND I CAN DISCUSS. I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING TO LOOK FOR NEXT YEAR -- THIS YEAR EVEN. THANK YOU.
04:11:36.232: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. PAS B-2, AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND CHAPTER 55 (ZONING), ZONING OF 0.6 ACRE FROM TWP (TOWNSHIP DISTRICT) TO R1B (SINGLE-FAMILY DWELLING DISTRICT) ALLEN REZONING, 595 RIVERVIEW DRIVE. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM AND SECONDED BY GRISWOLD. DISCUSSION OF B-2 (ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. B-3, AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND CHAPTER 55 (ZONING), ZONING OF 0.48 ACRE FROM TWP (TOWNSHIP DISTRICT) TO R1B (SINGLE-FAMILY DWELLING DISTRICT) PAYNE REZONING, 245 ORCHARD HILLS DRIVE.

C-2 AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND SECTION 7.34 OF CHAPTER 77, FEES AND BONDS REQUIRED OF THE CODE OF THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI AND SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER SMITH. DISCUSSION OF C-1. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
04:12:45.835: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES, THANK YOU. I KNOW THIS IS JUST FIRST READING AND THERE'S OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT QUESTIONS. I'M CURIOUS TO WHO REALLY APPLIES FOR THIS TYPE OF LICENSE TO GO OUT OF BUSINESS. I WOULD IMAGINE PEOPLE ARE GOING OUT OF BUSINESS, THEY ARE PROBABLY HITTING HARD TIMES AND WE HAVE'S  ASSESSED A FEE. I WONDER IF WHO IN THE PAST -- IF I COULD BE ENTERTAINED.
04:13:14.264: >> THE ORDINANCE IS TO COMPLY WITH STATE LAW AND THERE IS A GOING OUT OF BUSINESS LAW. IT'S TO PREVENT BUSINESSES FROM SORT OF REGULARLY GOING OUT OF BUSINESS JUST TO ATTRACT CUSTOMERS IS THE BASIS FOR THE LAW. AND JUST RECENTLY, THE ANTIQUE STORE ON LIBERTY DID APPLY. AND SO THIS ORDINANCE IS -- IT CAME TO OUR ATTENTION THAT OUR FEE IS HIGHER THAN STATE LAW REGULATES. SO WE ARE JUST LOWERING THE FEE. AND WE PASSED THAT ON TO THE MOST RECENT APPLICANTS AS WELL.
04:13:46.195: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  BUT A BUSINESS -- THE BUSINESS IS NOT REQUIRED --
04:13:49.866: >> THEY ARE.
04:13:50.199: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THEY ARE REQUIRED BUT WE DON'T ENFORCE IT? WE HAVEN'T? ESSENTIALLY? I MEAN THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF BUSINESSES THAT HAVE GONE OUT OF BUSINESS IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS, AND I GUESS I CAN SUBMIT THIS AS AN AGENDA QUESTION, FOR THE NEXT AGENDA. THANK YOU.
04:14:07.216: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
04:14:10.219: >> Councilmember Hayner:  IT'S ALL TYPES OF BUSINESSES, NOT JUST RETAIL? SO I HAVE AN LLC, IF I CHOOSE TO TO DISSOLVE THAT FROM THE FUTURE --
04:14:20.596: >> I BELIEVE IT'S JUST RETAIL, BECAUSE OF DRAWING CUSTOMERS INTO THE STORE, OR ADVERTISING A SALE.
04:14:26.169: >> Councilmember Hayner: CONSTANTLY GOING OUT OF BUSINESS SALE, I UNDERSTAND. I DON'T RECALL IN MY OWN LICENSING THAT I'M REQUIRED TO GIVE THIS PERMIT TO, YOU KNOW, FLIP OVER.
04:14:39.816: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
04:14:41.284: >> Councilmember Eaton: I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT THE STATE STATUTE, THIS GOVERNS GOING OUT OF BUSINESS SALES. SO THAT A BUSINESS CANNOT CONDUCT A PERIODIC GOING OUT OF BUSINESS SALE WITHOUT ACTUALLY GOING OUT OF BUSINESS, YOU KNOW? SO IT'S NOT THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE A PERMIT TO TOP OPERATING YOUR BUSINESS, IT'S THAT YOU YOU HAVE TO HAVE A PERMIT TO GO OUT OF BUSINESS AND HAVE A SALE ON THE WAY OUT.
04:15:12.482: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. ALL IN FAVOR. [CHORUS OF AYES] ALL OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. DC-1, RESOLUTION TO DEVELOP A PLAN TO EXPAND ACCESS TO VOTING AND REGISTRATION BEYOND THE MINIMUM REQUIRED BY THE MICHIGAN CONSTITUTION FOR EVEN YEAR NOVEMBER GENERAL ELECTIONS. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN AND SECONDED BY GRAND. DISCUSSION OF DC-1, MR. ACKERMAN.
04:15:35.304: >> Councilmember Ackerman: JUST SOME CONTEXT FOR COLLEAGUES. I CAN TAKE VERY LITTLE CREDIT FOR THIS RESOLUTION. I WAS APPROACHED BY A GROUP OF VOLUNTEERS FROM THE GROUP VOTERS, NOT POLITICIANS. THE GRASS ROOTS VOLUNTEER ORGANIZATION THAT SECURED A STATEWIDE REFERENDUM TO BRING THE END OF GERRYMANDERING. THEY SHARED WITH ME THE SUBSTANCE OF THE NOW RESOLUTION IS CONSIDERED A BEST PRACTICE AND INCREASING ACCESS TO THE VOTE. SO I TOLD THEM IT SEEMED COMMON SENSICAL AND I SENT TO A DRAFT TO MS. BEAUDRY, WHO AS IT TURNS OUT WAS ALREADY PURSUING SOMETHING SIMILAR, AND WAS SEEKING TO GET APPROVAL FOR THAT IN THE FISCAL 20-21 BUDGET. TONIGHT THIS RESOLUTION SIMPLY SERVES TO CODIFY THAT COUNCIL SUPPORTS AN INITIATIVE TO INCREASE VOTER ACCESS THROUGH THESE MEANS, AND INITIATIVE THAT THE CITY CLERK WAS ALREADY PURSUING THROUGH OUR STANDARD BUDGET PROCESS. IT ALSO WOULD PROVIDE A TEMPLATE FOR VOTERS, NOT POLITICIANS, TO MOVE ON TO THEIR NEXT PHASE OF THEIR LIFE CYCLE, WHICH IS INCREASING VOTER TURNOUT THROUGH OTHER MEANS. THIS ONE BEING INCLUDED. SO WE COULD ACTUALLY BECOME A MODEL FOR THEIR ORGANIZATION, AS THEY LOBBY OTHER MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENTS. TO THE SUBSTANCE, STA IN THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR, WHICH WOULD BEGIN IN JULY OF 2020, THE CITY WOULD INCREASE OPPORTUNITIES FOR POTENTIAL VOTERS TO REGISTER BY ONE INCREASING THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CITY CLERK BUSINESS HOURS, BY A KCUMULATIVE HOURS, AND PROVIDE REGISTRATION AND ABSENTEE SUPPORT AT A SATELLITE LOCATION, IN ADDITION TO CITY HALL AND THREE, TELL PEOPLE ABOUT THESE CHANGES FOR AND WIDE. THEN I JUST WANT TO MAKE A QUICK AMENDMENT BEFORE WE BEGIN DISCUSSION. OVER THE WEEKEND, COUNCILMEMBER NELSON PROPERLY POINTED OUT TO ME THAT THE 24-HOUR CLAUSE IN THE RESOLVE CLAUSE ITSELF COULD BE INTERPRETED IN MANY WAYS, WHICH UPON MY FURTHER READING, IT COULD. SO TO HELP CLARIFY THE INTENT, I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE AN AMENDMENT WHICH MS. BEAUDRY, I HOPE WOULD DISTRIBUTE NOW. ALL IT DOES IS INSERT TWO WORDS, THREE WORDS. SO IT WOULD READ "RESOLVED THAT FOR EVEN YEAR NOVEMBER GENERAL ELECTIONS, THE PLAN SHOULD INCLUDE AT A MINIMUM BEING A 24 OPEN OFFICE SERVICE HOURS," AND THE BALANCE OF THE RESOLVE CLAUSE WOULD REMAIN THE SAME.
04:18:06.222: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE A SECOND? SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER COUNCR GRISWOLD. IS THAT FRIENDLY TO THE BODY? YOU STILL HAVE THE FLOOR.
04:18:23.105: >> Councilmember Ackerman: VOTERS AND NOT POLITICIANS, MS. BEAUDRY AND ME BUT IT COULD BE READ MULTIPLE WAYS AND THAT INDISPUTABLE. FORECAST I PUT THIS BEFORE YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.
04:18:38.621: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
04:18:39.522: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I WOULD LIKE TO BE A COSPONSOR. AND THIS WAS AN EXCITING THING TO READ ABOUT. I WAS ASKING COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SPECIFICS THAT WE WERE DOING AND I WOULD LIKE TO ASK TO BE ADDED AS A COSPONSOR. THANKS.
04:18:53.970: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
04:18:54.870: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I APPRECIATE COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN FOR BRINGING THIS FORTH AND THE WORK OF THAT -- THE ORGANIZATION DID TO BRING IT TO THE COUNCIL AND MS. BEA BEAUDRYR APPROVING IT AND MAKING SURE IT PASSES, THE STATE REQUIREMENTS WHEN IT COMES TO ALLOWING US TO DO THESE TYPE OF THINGS. SO I ALSO WOULD HIKE TO BE ADD ADD AS A COSPONSOR.
04:19:22.798: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM AND THEN GRISWOLD.
04:19:28.938: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU, MAYOR. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK STAFF FOR RESPONDING TO MY QUESTIONS. BASED ON THOSE RESPONSES, I AM COMFORTABLE MOVING FORWARD, IS WHAT IS CONTEMPLATED IS CONSISTENT WITH STATE LAW AND IMPORTANTLY, THE CITY CLERK SUPPORTS IT. MS. BEAUDRY IS THE ONE THAT HAS TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN, INCLUDING THE EXTRA HOURS FOR REGISTRATION AND EXTRA BALLOTING AND SO I THINK YOUR VIEWS ARE CRITICAL. MS. BEAUDRY, IT DIDN'T SEEM SO, BUT IF YOU DO HAVE ANY OTHER CONCERNS, CAN YOU PLEASE LET US KNOW WHAT THEY ARE OR MIGHT BE? AND I AM HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS TONIGHT. WE ALL WANT TO SEE AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE VOTING AND MAKING THESE IMPORTANT DECISIONS. I CAN'T RESIST NOTING, THOUGH, THAT I DO FIND IT A BIT INCONSISTENT ENTERTHAT A FEW OFY COLLEAGUES HERE, INCLUDING MY COLLEAGUE MR. ACKERMAN, WILL TAKE ACTIONS TO ENSURE THE MAXIMUM TURNOUT ENGAGEMENT IN NATIONAL ELECTIONS, AND NATIONAL DECISIONS, BUT WILL REJECT EVEN ALLOWING ANN ARBOR VOTERS TO CONSIDER THE VERY ONE THING THAT WOULD MAXIMIZE TURNOUT ENENGAGEMENT IN LOCAL EHECKIONS, MOVING TO MONDAY -- ELECTIONS MOVING TO NONPARTISAN ELECTIONS. YOU MENTIONED, MR. ACKERMAN THAT THIS GROUP OF VOTERS NOT POLITICIANS IS LOOKING AT WAYS TO IMPROVE TURNOUT THROUGH OTHER MEANS AND I WOULD -- CONSIDER THIS A REQUEST TO GAIN OR EARN THEIR SUPPORT THROUGH HELPING US PROMOTE NONPARTISAN ELECTIONS. WITH NONPARTISAN ELECTIONS, THE DECIDING ELECTION FOR LOCAL OFFICE WOULD ALWAYS BE IN THESE HIGH TURNOUT NOVEMBER EVEN YEAR ELECTIONS, NOT THE LOW TURNOUT AUGUST PRIMARY ELECTIONS THAT DECIDE THINGS NOW. SO HAVING SAID THAT, I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS TONIGHT.
04:21:35.364: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
04:21:39.235: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WOULD LIKE TO BE LISTED AS A COSPONSOR. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. AND I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK EVERYONE WHO WROTE IN EMAILS SUPPORTING THIS. IT CONCERNED ME AT FIRST BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT MUST BE CONTROVERSIAL GIVE THAN WE WERE GETTING SO MANY EMAILS ABOUT IT, BUT COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN ASSURED ME THAT WAS NOT THE CASE. THANK YOU.
04:22:03.192: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. DC-2, RESOLUTION CREATING A RESIDENT-DRIVEN SIDEWALK GAP-FILLING PROGRAM AND APPROPRIATE $150,000 FROM THE GENERAL FUND FUND BALANCE. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER NELSON AND SECONDED BY GRISWOLD. DISCUSSION OF DC-2. COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
04:22:32.121: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I HAVE TO THANK FOR HELPING ME BRING THIS FORWARD. WE HAD CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW THE CITY DOES IT WORK IN PRIORITIZING SIDEWALK GAPS. THERE'S A REAL CHALLENGE, BECAUSE FROM TERMS OF EFFICIENCIES AND LEVERAGING GRANT MONIES, IT MAKES A WHOLE LOT OF SENSE FOR THE CITY TO COORDINATE PROJECTS WITH -- SIDEWALK PROJECTS WITH WORK THAT'S ALREADY BEING DONE AND THERE ARE SO MANY SIDEWALK GAPS AND OUR STAFF IS REALLY WORKING HARD TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THOSE GAPS THAT ARE REALLY WANTED AND DESIRED BY RESIDENTS. AND SO BECAUSE OUR -- THIS TABLE HAS DISCUSSED IN THE LAST YEAR, A COUPLE OF SIDEWALKS THAT ENDED UP BEING SOMEWHAT CONTROVERSIAL, THE COST OF WHICH WAS TALKED ABOUT, IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO HAVE A MORE FORMAL PROCESS FOR RESIDENTS TO REQUEST WORK ON SIDEWALK GAPS AND ALSO GET SOME SUBSIDY TO -- FOR THE ASSESSMENT COST TO THE PROPERTY OWNERS. SO WHAT I'M PROPOSING IS -- IS A BUDGET AMENDMENT, BUT THE REASON THAT I'M BRINGING IT AS A BUDGET AMENDMENT, IS SO THAT FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE SO THAT PROJECTS CAN BE PROPOSED AND THE CITY CAN PLAN FOR THEM SO THAT WORK CAN BE DONE IN THE SPRING, PERHAPS. AND THERE'S NO -- THERE'S NO CERTAINTY ABOUT ANY OF THIS MONEY BEING SPENT. IT'S ENTIRELY UP TO STAFF TO SIFT THROUGH THE PROPOSALS THAT COME IN, AND I TRUST OUR STAFF TO WEIGH THEM AND FIGURE OUT WHICH ARE MOST FEASIBLE. I'M ENCOURAGED THAT ON THIS AGENDA TONIGHT, WE HAVE THE SIDEWALK GAP BEING FILLED ON STIMSON STREET WHICH WAS A HIGH PRIORITY SIDEWALK GAP BUT IT JUST -- IT DIDN'T SEEM THAT IT WAS -- FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS THAT RESIDENTS HAVE WANTED THAT PARTICULAR GAP FILLED. IT WASN'T FITTING IN TO BE COORDINATED WITH OTHER WORK. SO I'M HOPEFUL THAT THERE CAN BE SUPPORT AT THIS TABLE FOR WHAT I'M -- I'M SEEING AS A FAIRLY SMALL BUDGET AMENDMENT. A SMALL IDEA, A TRIAL IDEA, TO SEE HOW WE CAN ADDRESS SOME OF THE REALLY MOST WANTED SIDEWALK GAPS IN THE CITY AND I'M HOPING THAT IF WE ARE ABLE TO SUBSIDIZE THE COST BY 50%, THAT IT MIGHT MAKE THESE PROJECTS RUN A LITTLE BIT MORE SMOOTHLY. I APPRECIATE AS PART OF THIS RESOLUTION, THERE'S AN ELEMENT OF PUBLIC SURVEY FOR THOSE WHO LIVE WITHIN 750 FEET OF THE SIDEWALK GAP. I'M HOPEFUL THAT WILL HELP US AT THIS TABLE HAVE MORE INFORMATION TO LOOK AT IN TERMS OF HOW A SIDEWALK IS LIKELY TO BE USED IN THOSE PARTICULAR NEIGHBORHOODS. SO I -- I ASK EVERYONE TO PLEASE SUPPORT MY RESOLUTION. THANK YOU.
04:25:28.230: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN. ZACK >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU. THIS IS A GREAT IDEA. FROM A FISCAL DISCIPLINE STANDPOINT, I THINK THIS IS A MODEST ASK THAT ISN'T EVEN CERTAIN TO BE USED IN THIS FACE 8:00 YEAR. AND THAT SETS US UP TO HAVE AN ESTABLISHED PROGRAM IN JULY 2020, AS WE BEGIN THE NEW FISCAL YEAR. SO KUDOS TO YOU FOR THE IDEA. THANKS TO STAFF FOR SUPPORTING IT AND PUTTING THE MECHANISMS IN PLACE AND I WILL GLADLY SUPPORT THIS.
04:25:56.125: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
04:25:56.992: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. I'M ALSO LOOKING FORWARD TO SUPPORTING THIS. WHILE IT'S A BUDGET AMENDMENT, I'M REALLY FULLY SUPPORTIVE OF TRYING PILOTS AND SEEING HOW THE PROCESS HAD A COUPLE OF EQUITY CONCERNS WHEN I READ THE BEGINNING OF, BUT THEN THE FIRST PART OF THE RESOLVE CLAUSE, THAT IF THERE ARE HIGHER PRIORITIES THAT THEY WILL GET BUMPED TO THE QUEUE, I THINK -- THAT IT WON'T NECESSARILY ONLY BE HIGH RESOURCE NEIGHBORHOODS THAT CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT. I THINK WE HAVE HAD SIMILAR SUCCESSFUL MODELS IN TERMS OF TRAFFIC CALMING AND THAT SEEMS TO WORK VERY WELL. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. IT'S TERRIFIC.
04:26:44.840: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
04:26:46.942: >> Councilmember Eaton: TYPICALR BUDGET MID-YEAR, BUT IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE, IT'S A SMALL ASK. AND IT MAKES SURE THAT THESE FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE PRIOR TO JULY 1st, AT THE BEGINNING OF THE FISCAL YEAR. SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS AND I HOPE OTHERS WILL AS WELL.
04:27:09.965: >> THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR.
04:27:12.868: >> Councilmember Lumm: I HAVE CONCERNED WITH THE PROGRAM ITSELF AND WITH THE PROCESS. IT SEEMS THAT COUNCILMEMBER NELSON'S MOTIVATIONS ARE TO ACCELERATE THE BASE OF FILLING SIDEWALK GAPS AND TO HAVE A PROCESS THAT BETTER ACCOMMODATES THE PREFERENCE OF NEIGHBORHOODS. IN THE SECOND WARD, THERE ARE SEVERAL NEIGHBORHOODS WITH WIDE STREETS AND NOT MUCH TRAFFIC AND FOLKS HAVE LITTLE TO KNOW INTEREST IN SIDEWALKS. AND FRANKIELY THERE'S NOT A REAL NEED. I HAVE CONCERNS WITH THIS APPROACH, FIRST BY OFFERING DISCOUNTS ON ASSESSMENTS AND THE CITY PAY -- WE ARE FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGING THE RULES THAT THE PROPERTY OWNERS BENEFITING FROM THE IMPROVEMENT, NOT THE CITY ITSELF PAYS FOR THE COST OF THE IMPROVEMENT. THAT APPROACH IS QUITE REASONNAGE AND DISCOUNTING ASSESSMENTS DOES NOT SEEM FAIR OR EQUITABLE TO ALL OF THOSE FOLKS WHO HAVE BORNE THE FULL COST OF THE IDENTICAL IMPROVEMENT IN THE PAST OR TO THOSE FOLKS WHO HAVE TO BEAR THE FULL COST OF THE IDENTICAL IMPROVEMENT IN THE FUTURE, JUST BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T ASK FOR IT. I -- YOU KNOW, I THINK THE BASIS ON WHICH THIS NEW PROGRAM WOULD WORK, THAT FOLKS -- THAT THEY WANT THE SIDEWALK, AND THAT DESIRE IS ITSELF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT -- IT'S FLAWED. I MEAN, THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT IS THE SIDEWALK. NOT WHETHER THE NEIGHBORHOOD REQUESTED IT. I MEAN, I JUST -- I QUESTION HOW CAN IT BE EQUITABLE OR FRANKLY MAKE SENSE TO CHARGE FOLKS MORE OR LESS FOR THE SAME THING? SO -- AND SO IN LOOKING AT IT -- AND APPRECIATE THE QUESTIONS, I LACK ASKED ABOUT THIS SINCE 2015, THERE'S BEEN TEN SIDEWALK GAP PROJECTS WHERE FOLKS HAVE PAID THE FULL ASSESSMENT. THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET A 50% DISCOUNT. I DO BELIEVE FAIRNESS IN EQUITY OVER TIME ARE IMPORTANT PRINCI TO ADHERE TO, AND THAT'S WHERE I RESISTED CHANGING WATER AND SEWER HOOKUPS RECENTLY. I HAVE A COUPLE OF PROCESS CONCERNS JUST AS I SAID WITH THE CLIMATE ACTION PROJECT A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO. I DON'T BELIEVE THIS IS A GOOD PROCESS OR GOOD BUDGET DISCIPLINE. ALSO WITH SOMETHING AS IMPORTANT AS THIS, IT DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT TO DO IT BY COUNCIL RESOLUTION WITHOUT ANY COMMUNITY DISCUSSION OR INPUT. IN 2016, IT WAS INCORPORATED INTO THE MILLAGE THAT VOTERS ACTUALLY VOTED ON. I DO UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE THE MONTH MOTIVATION. I WOULD FULLY SUPPORT CREATING A BOTTOM UP NEIGHBORHOOD THAT WOULD GIVE GREATER PRIOR IN THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE THEY ARE DESIRED BUT GIVING PRIORITY IS ENTIRELY DIFFERENT THAN GRANTING FOLKS A PRICE DISCOUNT. SO I SUSPECT THAT THIS WILL MASS TONIGHT BUT THOSE ARE MY CONCERNED.
04:30:34.169: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
04:30:35.404: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES, I HAVE RESERVATIONS ON THIS. I KNOW WE HAVE ISSUES WITH OUR SIDEWALK GAPS AND IT FALLS OUTSIDE OF THE BUDGET REQUIREMENTS. I THINK YOU HAVE TO MEET A VERY HIGH THRESHOLD. WE WILL TALK ABOUT OUR NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS ALREADY. THIS IS GREAT CONVERSATION TO HAVE AT THAT BUDGET RETREAT, AND SUBSEQUENT WORK SESSIONS. I DON'T SEE IT ADDRESSING THE ISSUES I SEE WITH ASSESSMENTS BUT I WILL BRING THAT IN A SUBSEQUENT MEETING. I JUST DON'T SEE THAT THE RESOLUTION REALLY SPELLS OUT WHAT COMMUNITY BENEFIT IS. THAT'S AN ARBITRARY TERM THAT CAN BE TOSSED AROUND AND, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE HEARD FROM OTHER RESIDENTS WHO HAVE COME AND SPOKEN TO US TO US ABOUT SIDEWAK ASSESSMENTS THAT THEY DON'T HAVE KIDS AND THEY DON'T HAVE KIDS THAT USE A SIDEWALK. I JUST PAUSE AT ALLOWING THAT TO DICTATE HOW DEVELOPMENT AND HOW COMMUNITY BENEFIT PROGRESSES. THAT THE GREATER GOOD QUESTION IS GOING TO BE LIMITED TO 750 FEET. YOI DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS A GOOD USE OF OUR FUNDS WE ALREADY SPENT $160,000 OR A FAILED PROJECT. AND NOW WE ARE GOING TO SPEND $300,000, AND WE HAVE NOTHING TO HOLD ON TO. THERE'S NOTHING THAT IS TANGIBLE. UNFORTUNATELY THIS DOESN'T MEET THE THRESHOLD TO AMEND THE BUDGET.
04:32:47.769: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
04:32:48.637: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANKS, MR. MAYOR. IT'S LIKE THE $160,000 MOVEMENT OF THE STEAM PROCESS. I WOULD SAY THAT ALL THE NEIGHBORS WHO WERE NOT NOTIFIED UNTIL THAT THING WAS THREE STAGES DOWN THE ROAD, THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED UNDER THIS PROGRAM AND I BELIEVE WE WOULD HAVE HAD A BETTER OUTCOME FOR THAT PROCESS. AND SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT ESTABLISHING COMMUNITY BENEFITS, I'M -- I HARKEN BACK TO WHAT OUR ADMINISTRATOR SAID TO ME ABOUT -- DURING THE TRAVER SIDEWALK PROCESS, THAT WE ARE PAYING FOR SIDEWALKS ALL OVER THE CITY, AND THERE ARE SIDEWALKS THAT I MAY NOT EVER STEP ON. I PARAPHRASE MR. LAZARUS, YOU RECALL THE CONVERSATION. I HAD TO AGREE WITH YOU THERE. I LOATHE TO APPROVE THIS OUT OF THE BUDGET CYCLE. ANYBODY THAT WITHIN 17 -- 750 FEET CAN INITIATE THIS PROCESS TO BECOME PART OF THIS TRIAL PROGRAM. SO IF COUNCIL OR ANOTHER RESIDENT WHO IS NOT WITHIN 750 FEET OF THIS SIDEWALK GAP, THEY -- AND THEY WANT TO INITIATE AND THIS SPEAKS TO COUNCILWOMAN LUMM'S EQUITY CONCERNS AND THEY WANT TO INITIATE A SIDEWALK GAP IMPROVEMENT, LIKE WE HAVE HAD FOLKS WHO -- YOU KNOW, I DON'T -- I SEE A PLACE EVERY DAY WHERE I SEE PEOPLE WALKING IN THE STREET. I SEE FOLKS WITH WHEELCHAIRS AND WALKERS AND WHITE CANE FOLKS WALKING IN THE STREET BECAUSE THERE'S NOT A SIDEWALK ON THE WAY TO THIS BUS STOP. BUT I DON'T LIVE WITHIN 750 FEET OF THAT. IF I BRING THAT ACTION TO COUNCIL TO SAY LET'S START THE SIDEWALK ASSESSMENT PROCESS FOR THIS MUCH NEEDED SIDEWALK GAP, IS THAT COMING IN UNDER THE OLD RULES OR THE NEW RULES? THE OLD RULES, ROOT? BECAUSE I'M NOT WITHIN 750 FEET OF THAT SIDEWALK GAP I WOULD LIKE TO FILL. SO THAT'S CREATING THIS KIND OF -- I'M CONCERNED ABOUT HOW WHEN PEOPLE BRING GAPS INTO THE PROGRAM, UNDER WHAT PROGRAM WILL THEY BE SERVICED?
04:35:29.264: >> City Admin. Lazarus: SO WE ALWAYS --
04:35:32.067: >> Councilmember Hayner:  THAT COULD BE WITH THE SPONSOR OR MR. LAZARUS?
04:35:36.137: >> City Admin. Lazarus: SO STAFF HAS ALWAYS TRIED TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF COST OF SPECIAL ASSESSMENT TO PROPERTY OWNERS. SOMETIMES AS MS. NELSON TALKED ABOUT, THAT'SENT GREATING IT INTO A LARGER PROJECT. SOMETIMES IT'S TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE GRANT OPPORTUNITIES WHICH, YOU KNOW, WHENEVER YOU ACCEPT MONEY FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE, THERE'S ALWAYS STRINGS ATTACHED. WHAT THAT SOMETIMES SETS UP ARE HIGH PRIORITY ASSESSMENTS THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEAVAGE OTHER MONIES AND OFFSET THE COST. I WILL TURN THE FLOOR OVER, BECAUSE THOSE ARE YOUR INITIATIVE, BUT I THINK IT REALLY WAS A MATTER OF TRYING TO ADDRESS GETTING THOSE FILLED WHEN WE DON'T HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO FIND OTHER SOURCES OF FUNDS.
04:36:34.729: >> Councilmember Nelson:  IT'S TRUE THAT THE 150.
04:36:42.103: >> Audience Member:  $150,000, S ARBITRARY. IT'S SORT OF AN EXPERIMENT. I MEAN I -- I WAS TRYING TO THINK AROUND WHAT WOULD BE A -- WHAT WOULD BE A RADIUS? WHAT WOULD BE A DISTANCE OF A NEIGHBORHOOD THAT WOULD -- I SEE SIDEWALK -- MAYBE I TAKE A BUS ACROSS TOWN AND THERE'S A SIDEWALK GAP THAT I USE A LOT BUT IT'S NOT WITHIN 750 FEET OF WHERE I LIVE. I DO APPRECIATE THAT SIDEWALKS ARE A CITY-WIDE RESOURCE THAT ARE A BENEFIT TO ALL OF US, BUT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS PROGRAM, I WAS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A STRUCTURE WHERE IT COULD BE ADMINISTERED IN A CLEAR WAY, AND WE WOULD GET CLEAR FEEDBACK THAT WAS DEFINED. I FIND IT REALLY COMPELLING WHEN SOMEBODY SAYS, YOU KNOW, THIS IS -- THIS IS A BLOCK FROM WHERE I LIVE AND I WALK IT EVERY DAY. YOU KNOW, I WAS TRYING TO THINK OF IT -- OF HOW WE WOULD MEANINGFUL FEEDBACK FROM PEOPLE WHO HAD THE MOST EXPERIENCE -- MOST LIKELY TO HAVE THE MOST EXPERIENCE WITH THAT PARTICULAR SIDEWALK GAP. AND SO THAT'S WHY I HAVE PRESSURE FROM THIS DIRECTION AND LIKE WHAT MR. LAZARUS SAID, BECAUSE STAFF IS WORKING SO DILIGENTLY TO LEVERAGE MONEY FROM OTHER PLACES AND OTHER AVENUES, I WAS HOPEFUL THAT THIS SMALL POT OF MONEY WOULD BE AN EXPERIMENT OF TRYING TO CREATE AN EXTRA BOOST FOR THOSE OPPORTUNITIES THAT DON'T HAVE AN EXCUSE FOR SUBSIDY.
04:38:07.088: >> Councilmember Hayner:  SO LIKE STIMSON, WHICH WE JUST APPROVED THE ENGINEERING ON, THAT WILL BE FULL ASSESSMENT FOR THOSE FOLKS, BECAUSE NOW CAN SOMEBODY FROM THAT APARTMENT BUILDING RUSH IN HERE AND SAY, HEY I WANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS? YOU SEE WHERE I'M COMING FROM? I JUST -- I'M TORN ON THE IDEA OF THIS EQUITY ISSUE AND I THINK IF WE WANT TO START TO FILL OUR GAPS IN A MORE -- MORE QUICKLY AND SO ON, AT SOME POINT YOU HAVE TO HOLD UP THAT LENS, YOU KNOW, IF IT'S THE EQUITY LENS OR WHATEVER IT IS AND EVERYBODY WHO IS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT EQUATION, SORRY. I MEAN, OF COURSE, THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED WHEN WE DID THE SIDEWALK REPLACEMENT MILLAGE. I ASKED FOR FOUR SLABS AND I DIDN'T ASK FOR A DISCOUNT. WE HAD A DIFFERENT METHOD FOR SERVING THE SIDEWALK REPAIR NEEDS BUT I'M NOT SURE EVERYBODY WILL.
04:38:51.499: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I ACTUALLY WONDER CAN MR. HUPY OR SOMEBODY ANSWER THE QUESTION, ABOUT WHETHER STIMSON IS FULL ASSESSMENT OR ARE WE GOING TO BE LEVERAGING ANY -- LEVERAGING ANY SUBSIDY FOR THAT? BECAUSE I KNOW THAT WAS BROUGHT TO US BY MY RESIDENTS.
04:39:20.361: >> MR. HUPY?
04:39:20.695: >> Councilmember Nelson: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER WAS WONDERING SINCE WE JUST APPROVED PLANNING FOR STIMSON, IS -- IS STIMSON GOING TO BE LEVERAGING ANY GRANT MONEY OR ANY -- IS THAT -- IS THE ASSESSMENT FOR THE PROPER OWNER ON STIMSON GOING TO BE SUBSIDIZED IN ANY WAY?
04:39:39.581: >> CURRENTLY THERE'S NO IDENTIFIED GRANTS TO STIMSON. WE WOULD LOOK FOR IT, AND IF WE FIND IT, WE WOULD APPLY IT.
04:39:52.460: >> City Admin. Lazarus: BUT STIMSON IS A SIDE YARD, RIGHT?
04:39:57.832: >> THE QUESTION IS STIMSON A SIDE YARD? I DON'T KNOW WHICH WAY THE LOT FACES.
04:40:07.342: >> THERE'S THREE PROPERTIES ON STIMSON. I BELIEVE TWO OF THEM ON THE NORTH SIDE ARE SIDE LOTS. I'M NOT SURE --
04:40:18.152: >> City Admin. Lazarus: SO SIDE LOTS WE ASSESS 50%. SO THERE AS A BUILT-IN DISCOUNT.
04:40:25.927: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
04:40:27.428: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. I JUST -- YOU KNOW, THIS PROGRAM IS CALLED A PILOT PROGRAM, BUT IT CALLS FOR THAT THE FUNDING SHALL REMAIN AVAILABLE WITHOUT REGARD TO FISCAL YEAR. WE ARE -- YOU KNOW, WE ARE ASKING FOR RESIDUAL COMMITMENT MADE, IF I'M READING THIS CORRECTLY.
04:40:53.888: >> I BELIEVE THE PHRASE YOU ARE READING IS FOR THE INITIAL $150,000. SO IT DOESN'T EXPIRE AT THE END OF THIS BUDGET YEAR. THE $150,000 STAYS REGARDLESS OF BUDGET YEAR UNTIL IT'S SPENT DOWN.
04:41:09.570: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  SO IT WOULD BE FOR THE ONE-TIME ASK AND NOT FOR EVERY SUBSEQUENT BUDGET?
04:41:15.143: >> IT WOULD HAVE TO BE ADDITIONAL H ASK THE FOLLOWING BUDGETS.
04:41:19.914: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  YOU KNOW, AGAIN, I APPRECIATE THE SPIRIT THAT THIS IS FOUNDED UNDER, BUT I JUST -- I CAN'T SUPPORT A BUDGET AMENDMENT. I WOULD RATHER HAVE THIS BE ROLLED INTO A GREATER REFORM PACKAGE FOR NEXT YEAR. THERE'S WAY TOO MANY GREAT NEEDS AND, YOU KNOW, $150,000 HERE, $100,000 HERE, HEY, ALL OF A SUDDEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT $1 MILLION. YOU KNOW, I JUST -- I NEED TO HAVE BETTER -- BETTER CERTAINTIES AND MORE OF A RETURN ON INVESTMENT. I CAN'T BE SPENDING MONEY THE WAY THAT PEOPLE ARE ASKING FOR. SORRY. NOT WITHOUT A BETTER, MORE COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM.
04:41:57.919: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
04:41:59.087: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR AND THANKS TO COLLEAGUES FOR THEIR CONCERNS AROUND EQUITY. IT FEELS LIKE FAIRNESS MORE THAN EQUITY. AND I -- I APPRECIATE YOU WANTING TO GIVE EVERYONE A FAIR DEAL OVER THE LAST FEW DECADES, BUT I THINK WE HAVE ALL EXPERIENCED THIS SYSTEM IN SOME WAY, CAUSING OUR CONSTITUENTS GRIEF, CAUSING US GRIEF, CAUSING CITY ENGINEERS GRIEF. AND IF THE SYSTEM ISN'T WORKING, AT SOME POINT, WE HAVE TO CHANGE IT. AND AT SOME POINT A LINE IN THE SAND WILL BE DRAWN AT WHICH POINT PEOPLE WILL GET TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF A BETTER SYSTEM IN THE FUTURE AND PEOPLE WILL HAVE TO COME TO TERMS WITH HAVING BEEN BILLED IN THE PAST. AND I APPRECIATE THIS. I THINK THIS IS A SMALL INCREMENTAL IMPROVEMENT IN BERIBETTERING OUR SYSTEM. I THINK TO COUNCILMEMBER RAM LAR RAMLAWI'S POINT, THI THERE IS ME WE CAN DO. IT'S A SMALL AND MODEST STEP, BUT I'M GLAD TO SUPPORT IT.
04:43:10.725: >> Mayor Taylor: FOURTHers DISCUSSION? I'M TORN AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE I'M GOING ON, THIS I'M AFRAID. I AGREE WITH COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN, WITH RESPECT TO US HAVING EXPERIENCED TROUBLES WITH SIDEWALK -- FILLING SIDEWALK GAPS A WAY THAT FILLING SIDEWALKS OUGHT TO GET, BECAUSE THERE ARE A PUBLIC BENEFIT. AND I ALSO UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN THAT WAS -- AROSE WITH RESPECT TO THE -- THAT AROSE WITH RESPECT TO THE INTRODUCTION OF THE SIDEWALK MILLAGE. BUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS, AS I UNDERSTAND, IT -- AND MAYBE I'M MISUNDERSTANDING THE PROPOSAL. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS AND THE SIDEWALK MILLAGE IS THAT EVERYONE ACHIEVED -- EVERYONE RECEIVED THE SAME BENEFIT GOING FORWARD AFTER THE SIDEWALK MILLAGE PASSED. THAT IS TO SAY THIS WAS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PERSONS GETTING THEIR SIDEWALKS FIXED AFTER PASSAGE. WITH THAT REGARD, 100% ACROSS THE BOARD. HERE, IF THIS PASSES GOING FORWARD SOME RESIDENTS WILL BE CHARGED FULL FREIGHT. AND SOME RESIDENTS WILL BE CHARGED HALF FREIGHT FOR THE SAME SERVICE, FOR THE SAME PIECE OF INFRASTRUCTURE. I THINK WE SHOULD TAKE STEPS TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN DO SIDEWALK -- FILLING SIDEWALK GAPS BETTER BECAUSE FILLING SIDEWALK GAPS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF IMPROVING OUR SAFETY INFRASTRUCTURE. BUT I THINK THAT THIS SOLUTION, ALTHOUGH OBVIOUSLY WELL INTENDED IT HAS THE EFFECT OF -- OF TREATING FUTURE SIDEWALK RECIPIENTS DIFFERENTLY AND THAT DIFFERENCE IS -- THE DIFFERENCE IS NOT A RELEVANT ONE. THAT IS TO SAY THE INITIATIVE OF THE RESIDENTS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO -- YOU KNOW, IF RESIDENTS COME FORWARD, I'M GLAD THAT THEY WANT SIDEWALKS BUT THE FACT THAT -- THE FACT THAT THEY DO, I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S SUFFICIENT TO GET THEM A 50% DISCOUNT.
04:45:23.558: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I THINK COUNCILMEMBER LUMM ASKED A QUESTION TO THE AGENDA THAT QUESTIONED A BIT THAT. MOST OF THE SIDEWALK GAPS THAT ARE FILLED NOW, OR ALMOST ALL OF THEM, ARE ALREADY SUBSIDIZED IN SOME WAY, JUST BECAUSE THE CITY HAS LEVERAGED PUBLIC MONIES FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE. AND THE IDEA FOR THIS PROGRAM IS THAT THERE'S A SIDEWALK GAP THAT DOESN'T QUALIFY FOR ANOTHER KIND OF A SUBSIDY AND WE ARE BASICALLY MAKING UP THE DIFFERENCE AND WE ARE TRYING TO EQUALIZE THINGS. MY UNDERSTANDING -- MAYBE -- I DON'T KNOW WHO ANSWERED THE QUESTION, WHERE JANE ASKED ABOUT THIS. THE WAY I READ THE RESPONSE, IF A REQUEST WERE TO COME -- COME IN TO STAFF, AND THAT PROJECT ALREADY QUALIFIED FOR YOU LEVERAGING GRANT MONEY IN SOME WAY, IT WOULDN'T -- IT WOULDN'T BE USING THIS POT OF MONEY. DID I UNDERSTAND THAT CORRECTLY? I MEAN, IN SOME WAYS --
04:46:22.383: >> THAT IS CORRECT.
04:46:23.584: >> Councilmember Nelson:  IT'S EVENING THE PLAYING FIELD BETWEEN THOSE THAT ARE ALREADY HELPED BY --
04:46:28.823: >> THAT IS CORRECT. IF THERE'S GRANT MONEY, WE WOULD NOT BE APPLYING SUBSIDY FROM THIS SOURCE.
04:46:35.496: >> Councilmember Nelson: RIGHT, AND SO IT SORT OF EQUALIZING THINGS AND SORT OF GIVING -- GIVING THE PROPERTY OWNERS, IT'S GIVING THEM A FIGHTING CHANCE TO NOT PAY MORE, RIGHT?
04:46:55.850: >> Mayor Taylor: I GUESS BUT THERE WILL STILL BE SIDEWALK GAPS THAT WILL NOT HAVE ANY GRANT SUPPORT.
04:47:06.193: >> Councilmember Nelson.
04:47:07.361: >> Mayor Taylor: AND THERE WILL BE SIDEWALK GAPS THAT WILL HAVE NO GRANT SUPPORT, BUT WILL HAVE THIS 50% BECAUSE THEY WERE INITIATED BY A RESIDENT, RATHER THAN STAFF OR COUNCIL. AAM. I WRONG?
04:47:24.812: >> Councilmember Ackerman: IT'S MY THIRD TIME SPEAKING, BBUTTHAT'S OKAY. IF THERE WAS A SCENARIO IN WHICH A NEIGHBORHOOD WAS SLATED TO HAVE A SIDEWALK GAP FILLED BUT WASN'T RESIDENT INITIATED, IS THERE THE POSSIBILITY THAT STAFF -- AND THIS COULD VERY WELL BE FOR THE BETTERMENT OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD, GO TOWARDS A SELF-INITIATED PROCESS, IN TERMS OF GETTING NEIGHBORHOOD BUY-IN AND STARTING A PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT PROCESS AND TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THIS FUNDING? IS THIS -- IS THIS I MEAN, THIS SEEMS LIKE A BETTER CHANNEL TO HELP RESIDENTS ACCESS THIS TYPE OF INFRASTRUCTURE.
04:48:06.754: >> YES, THE SHORT ANSWER, BUT THE CAVEAT IS TIMING. DEPENDING WHEN THEY ACTUALLY APPROACH AND WHERE THE PROJECT WAS AND IT'S -- ITS DESIGN CONSTRUCTION PHASE BUT THERE'S NO REASON NOT TO LET RESIDENTS KNOW OF THE PROGRAM.
04:48:35.483: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  I ALSO FEEL INVESTED. CAN BE ADDED AS A COSPONSOR.
04:48:41.422: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A COSPONSOR. SIDEWALKS ARE A CRITICAL PART OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE. WE PASSED A COMPLETE STREET POLICY. IT'S PART OF VISION ZERO. IF WE CONSIDER THIS A PILOT WHERE WE ARE MOVING TOWARDS THE GOAL OF ZERO FATALITIES AND SERIOUS CRASHES, I SEE THIS AS A FIRST STEP. AND ALSO, WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE POURING CEMENT FOR A FEW MONTHS. SO WE CAN PILOT THIS PROCESS WITHOUT ANY NEGATIVE IMPACT.
04:49:17.124: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? OKAY. ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
04:49:33.340: >> Councilmember Grand: YES.
04:49:33.941: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES.
04:49:36.877: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
04:49:37.378: >> Councilmember Eaton: YES.
04:49:37.978: >> Councilmember Nelson:  YES.
04:49:39.980: >> Councilmember Smith: YES.
04:49:40.581: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  NO.
04:49:43.551: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES.
04:49:47.455: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES.
04:49:48.189: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES.
04:49:51.091: >> Councilmember Lumm: NO. COLLECT MOTION CARRIES.
04:49:53.093: >> Mayor Taylor: DC-3, RESOLUTION TO AUTHORIZE SETTLEMENT OF PETERS BUILDING CO AND ROBERT WEBER vs. CITY OF ANN ARBOR, CASE NUMBER 18-822-NZ, MOVED BY GRAND AND SECONDED BY ACKERMAN. DISCUSSION OF DC-3. COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
04:50:14.281: >> Councilmember Bannister:  I WOULD LIKE TO AMPLIFY RESIDENT VOICES AND MENTION IN THE HISTORY OF TREE TOWN LAND USE DECISIONS THIS IS PROBABLY ONE OF OUR GREATEST TRAGEDIES. I WOULD LIKE TO TALK ABOUT IT THROUGH SIX LENSES OF OUR CORE VALUES, AND ALSO SIX POSSIBLE SOURCES OF FUNDING AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE CONSENT JUDGMENT. NOT ONLY ARE WE FIXING TO DESTROY THE HISTORIC 1849 HOME ON THE PROPERTY, BUT 184 TREES. 38 OF 57 LANDMARK TREES, WHICH REPRESENTS 70% OF THE TREES ON THE PROPERTY. ULTIMATELY, ALL OF THE TREES MAY DIE, DUE TO COMPAQION OF THE CRITICAL ROOT ZONES. SO THIS IS CONTRARY TO OUR CORE VALUES UNDER SIX OF THEM. WE JUST PASSED THE CLIMATE CRISIS ON OUR NEW WEBSITE, A20PLAN. WE TALK ABOUT ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCE, ENSURING THAT ALL NEIGHBORHOODS CAN WITHSTAND, RESPOND TO AND RECOVER FROM CLIMATE DISRUPTION. SO KEEPING THE NATURAL FEATURES IN PLACE IS I. WE DON'T HAVE A WAY TO MEASURE WHAT IS -- WHAT WE'RE LOSING, WHAT WE'RE GIVING UP. OUR DATA ON CARBON SEQUESTRATION AND WILDLIFE HABITAT AND BIRDS IS -- IS STILL IN THE EARLY FORMATION STAGES. COUNTY COMMISSIONERS ALERTED US THAT THE MALLETTS GRASS IS RATED F, AND LEAKY BASEMENTS FLOODING, DRAINAGE ISSUES COULD BE ON THE HORIZON. OTHER CORE VALUES, IN IN OUR MAR LAND USE PLAN, WE ARE MOVING AWAY FROM SITE SPECIFIC PLANS AND CHARACTER AREAS. CHARACTERS ABOUT HOW THE LARGER AREA MIGHT DEVELOP OVER TIME. SO THIS IS WHERE WE GET INTO SOURCES OF FUNDING AND WHAT THE PLACE COULD BE IN THE FUTURE AND ONE OF THE LAST TWO OF YOU ARE CORE VALUES THAT IS CONTRARY TO IS SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EQUITY. NPR TELLS US THAT TREE CANOPY MAPS NATIONWIDE TO INCOME AND IN MANY CASES RACE AND ETHNICITY. SO WARD ONE PEOPLE, OF THE NEIGHBORS WITHIN IS HUNDRED FEET OF THE PROPERTY, 81% HAVE SIGNED A PROTEST PETITION AND MORE ARE GROWING EACH DAY AS THEY FIND OUT, AND HEAR THE NEWS ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THAT 8-ACRE PARCEL. SO THOSE ARE THE CORE VALUES THAT WE'RE VIOLATING, AND AS IT TURNS OUT, WE HAVE SIX SOURCES OF FUNDING. WE DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS CONSENT JUDGMENT. I WOULD LIKE TO REMIND US, WE HAVE THE GREEN BELT MILLAGE. WE HAVE 6 MILLION SAVED UP. TAXPAYERS PAID THIS MONEY IN, SPECIFICALLY TO BUY GEMS LIKE THIS. TO PUT IT IN PERSPECTIVE, OUR CITY BUDGET IS $400 MILLION A YEAR, SO TO SPEND LESS THAN $5 MILLION OF OUR SAVINGS FOR THIS PURPOSE SEEMS REASONABLE. ANOTHER SOURCE OF FUNDING IS THE MICHIGAN NATIONAL -- NATURAL RESOURCE TRUST FUND. OUR CITY HAS ALREADY RECEIVED $10 MILLION FROM THE MICHIGAN TRUST FUND, AND SO WE CAN APPLY FOR MONEY THERE. THERE'S THE ELIZABETH DEAN FUND WE HAVE NOT LOOKED INTO. NEIGHBORS SUGGESTED THEY WOULD LIKE TO BUY IT. SO WE HAVE NOT FULLY EXPLORED A SPECIAL ASSESSMENT ON THEM, BUT THEY ARE VOLUNTEERING FOR THAT. WE COULD -- THE LAST TWO SOURCES OF FUNDING WOULD BE TO RENT THE COLLINS HOUSE, THE HISTORIC HOME FROM 1849. NEIGHBORS TELL ME THAT THE COBBLESTONE FARMS IS BOOKED, OVERFLOWING. WE COULD -- THIS IS NEIGHBORING PROPERTY. WE COULD HAVE A YEAR-ROUND FARMER'S MARKET, A COMMUNITY CENTER, AND WE COULD HAVE A FOOD SAFE, AND INCUBATOR AND WE COULD HAVE THE RENT INCOME. AND LASTLY FOR SOURCES OF FUNDING, RATHER THAN THE CONSENT JUDGMENT, WE COULD HAVE A MODEST AMOUNT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THIS WOULD BE IN KEEPING WITH THE CHARACTER OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD. IT IS ALONG A TRANSIT LINE. IT WOULD BE HARMONIOUS WITH THE EXISTING HOMES IN THE AREA. SO I URGE YOU ALL FOR THE TRAGEDY THAT WE ARE ABOUT TO EMBARK ON AND THE NEIGHBOR VOICES THAT WE HAVE BEEN HEARING. JUST DO A CHECK ON YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS TO TEAR DOWN 1 184 TREES AND SUBJECT THIS NEIGHBORHOOD TO POTENTIAL LEAKY BASEMENTS, FLOODING, LACK OF CARBON SEQUESTRATION, ALL OF THAT WILDLIFE THAT LIVES THERE CURRENTLY. IN THOSE -- ACTUALLY 265 TREES CURRENTLY. -- 265 TREES, ALL OF THE WILDLIFE, AND THE CARBON SEQUESTRATION. WE DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW MANY BIRDS WILL BE DISPLACED OR PARISH AT THIS TIME. PERISH AT THIS TIME. I WOULD URGE YOU TO SAVE ALL OF THESE LANDMARK BURR OAKS AND SAVE THESE TREES BUY THIS MONEY AND WORK WITH ME AND THE NEIGHBORS TO ASSEMBLE ANY NUMBER OF THESE SIX OTHER SOURCES OF FUNDING.
04:56:04.431: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
04:56:11.505: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I -- I SUPPORTED T PUD CHANGE WHEN IT CAME BEFORE US AT AN EARLY MEETING BECAUSE OF THE SHIFTM THE R1E ZONING TO THE PUD SEEMS LIKE AN APPROPRIATE MOVE FOR ME. WE DIDN'T SPEAK TO THE SITE PLAN BECAUSE THAT PUD WAS DEFEATED. IT NEEDED EIGHT VOTES BECAUSE THE NEIGHBOR'S CONCERNS OVER THE SITE AND RIGHTLY SO. AND SO I SUPPORTED THAT SHIFT FROM THE R1E, WHICH WAS NOT GREAT TO A PUD WHICH WOULD HAVE GIVEN US AN OPPORTUNITY TO -- TO -- YOU KNOW TO NEGOTIATE PUBLIC BENEFIT. AND THE -- OF COURSE, THE SITE PLAN THAT CAME WITH THAT ONE HAD WHAT I WOULD HAVE CALLED LITTLE PUBLIC BENEFIT TO IT. SOME, BUT NOT WHAT I WOULD REALLY CONSIDER A GREAT PUBLIC BENEFIT WORTHY OF A ZONING -- A REZONING DESIGNATION LIKE THAT. AND SO SINCE THIS -- THIS AUTHORIZING OF THE SETTLEMENT WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY AUTHORIZING THE PUD WITH THE SITE PLAN AS IT CAME BEFORE US AT THE LAST MEETING, I ONLY SUPPORTED HALF OF THAT EQUATION LAST TIME. AND I SUPPORT NONE OF IT THIS TIME. I -- I KNOW IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO SAVE THE TREES IN THE SENSE THAT SO MANY OF TREES MIGHT BE SAVED ACCORDING TO SITE PLAN THAT WAS BEFORE US, BUT I HAVE EXAMINED MY CONSCIOUS, ESPECIALLY AFTER SEEING THAT ANTROPACENE MOVIE, I'M HAVING A HARD TIME AGREEING THAT WOULD LEAD TO MORE CLEAR CUTTING OF OUR URBAN CON KNOW PILOT PROJECT. YOU KNOW, THERE ARE NO STATE LAWS TO PROTECT THESE TREES AND THAT'S THE REAL SHAME HERE, THAT WE ARE PROHIBITED BY STATE LAW FROM ACTING IN A WAY THAT MANY OF US HERE ON THIS PANEL FOR OR AGAINST THIS CONSENT JUDGMENT WOULD PROBABLY, YOU KNOW, CONSIDER PROPER BY CREATING STRONGER TREE ORDINANCES WHICH WE ARE WORKING ON. BUT THE REAL SHAME IS THAT THE STATE PROHIBITS US FROM ACTING IN OUR OWN BEST INTERESTS AND I WILL NEVER THINK THAT THE 51 NON-AFFORDABLE HOUSES ARE WORTH MORE THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXTEND THIS CONVERSATION AND -- AND, YOU KNOW, I WILL HAVE VERY DIFFICULT TIME SUPPORTING THIS -- THIS SETTLEMENT IN THIS CASE.
04:58:54.334: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER SMITH.
04:59:00.507: >> Councilmember Smith: SO, YOU KNOW, IF THESE WERE EASY DECISIONS, WE WOULD HAVE MADE THEM A LONG TIME AGO. I THINK ONE OF THE ISSUES -- AND I DON'T DISAGREE ABOUT THE VALUE OF FOREST FRAGMENTS OR OF A LOST TREES THAT ARE THERE, BUT I THINK, YOU KNOW, WE -- WE CAN QUANTIFY, YOU KNOW, THE IMPACTS OF THESE THINGS, AND WHAT THE -- AS WE LOOK AT OUR ROAD TO CARBCARBONNEUTRALITY, IT WILL RS TO MAKE SOME REALLY HARD CHOICES AND SOMETIMES THEY ARE NOT POPULAR CHOICES BUT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT WHAT WOULD IT MEAN TO MOVE 51 PEOPLE, FAMILIES TO THIS SITE TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF MILEAGE THAT THEY ARE COMMUTING? I THINK JAMIE McGARRIS SENT SOME INFORMATION TO ALL THE PEOPLE ON CAMPUS THAT HAS AN INTERESTING COMPARISON OF WHAT THIS MIGHT BE, AND I THINK IT IS NOT EASILY SO -- I MEAN, I WOULD TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF ISSUE SAYING IT'S SO CUT AND DRY THAT KEEPING THE TREES TO GET US TO CARBON NEUTRALITY. I'M ALSO A LITTLE BIT DISTRESSED BY THE DISCONNECT OF CALLING THIS LUXURY HOUSING OR UNAFFORDABLE HOUSING. I WAS LOOKING DURING OUR DISCUSSIONS EARLIER, ABOUT WHAT THE MEDIAN HOME VALUE IN ANN ARBOR IS, AND WHEN YOU -- WHEN YOU PULL IT UP ON NEIGHBORHOODSCOUT.COM, THE MEDIAN HOME VALUE IS $421,513. YOU KNOW, THAT'S PRETTY HIGH! YOU KNOW, AND THE FACT THAT THE TARGET MARKET IS LESS THAN THAT IS, YOU KNOW -- WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT ULTRA RICH PEOPLE MOVING IN HERE. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT REGULAR FOLKS. AND IT'S -- YOU KNOW, MORE MONEY THAN I PAID FOR MY HOUSE, BUT THAT'S WHAT THE PRICES ARE THESE DAYS. SO I THINK WE HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO SOBERLY LOOK AT ALL THE TRADEOFFS THAT WE ARE MAKING. WE CAN CERTAINLY SAY NO TO THIS. WE CAN -- MY FEAR IN SAYING NO TO THE CONSENT JUDGMENT IS WE END UP WITH CITY PLACE EAST. AND I THINK NOBODY WAS HAPPY WITH THAT OUTCOME. AS WE LOOK AT THIS, I THOUGHT IT WAS A REASONABLE COMPROMISE. AND, YOU KNOW, WE CAN DISAGREE ON THAT, BUT THAT'S WHERE I AM ON IT. I'M GOING TO -- I SUPPORTED THIS BEFORE, AND I WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT IT, AND FOR THE REASONS THAT I HAVE OUTLINED.
05:01:40.901: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
05:01:45.405: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WILL BE SUPPORTING IT, BUT I THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME LESSONS LEARNED AND WE -- IF WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT ACHIEVING OUR CLIMATE EMERGENCY GOAL, WE HAVE TO START MAKING OPTIMAL DECISIONS, NOT JUST ACCEPTING A COMPROMISE AND THE OPTIMAL DECISION ON THIS SITE, WOULD BE 150 WORKFORCE HOUSING UNITS WITH -- IN MIDRISE BUILDINGS AND SAVING THE TREES. WE COULD HAVE IT ALL, BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET THAT, BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE AN OPTIMAL PROCESS. AND I HOPE THAT IN THE FUTURE WE'LL TRY TO WORK TOGETHER AND FOCUS ON OPTIMAL PROCESSES, AND OPTIMAL OUTCOMES. THANKS.
05:02:36.990: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
05:02:38.558: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANKS, MR. MAYOR. YEAH, THIS IS NOT AN EASY DECISION FOR ANYONE. NOT NECESSARILY A GOOD DECISION. I DID SUPPORT THE CONSENT JUDGMENT AND THE REZONING PREVIOUSLY. I BELIEVED IT WAS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE CITY TO DO SO. I WILL SAY MY POSITION HAS NOT CHANGED. THERE'S HISTORY ON THIS. YOU KNOW, WE KIND OF SET US ON THIS PATH, WHEN, IN FEBRUARY OF 2019, WE UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED THE RESOLUTION, DIRECTING THE CITY ATTORNEY TO STAY PROCEEDINGS FOR THE CITY. IT WAS THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE THE PUD AND THE PROJECT WOULD HAVE THE SAME NUMBER OF UNITS BUT LESS NATURAL FEATURES DAMAGE. AND THEN AGAIN, OF COURSE, MORE RECENTLY, ON NOVEMBER 4th, WE UNANIMOUSLY AUTHORIZED THE SETTLEMENT AND THE CONSENT JUDGMENT WAS -- THAT RECOMMENDATION PASSED, AGAIN, UNANIMOUSLY. SO WE ALL RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS FAR FROM PERFECT, BUT CONSIDERING THE ALTERNATIVES AND THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE ALTERNATIVES, I BELIEVE ENTERING INTO THE CONSENT JUDGMENT IS THE BEST STRATEGY AT THIS POINT. WITHOUT THIS CONSENT JUDGMENT, WE HAVE NO GUARANTEES ON WHAT WILL HAPPEN ON THE PROPERTY IN TERMS OF THE TREES. THIS ACTUALLY GIVES US MORE TREE PROTECTION BY PASSING THIS. AND WITH THE CONSENT JUDGMENT, WE HAVE CLARITY AROUND THE PROJECT AND WE HAVE SOME PROTECTIONS AND COMMITMENTS FOR THE NATURAL FEATURES. SO, IT'S NOT PERFECT E SERVING THE ENTIRE WOODLANDS BUT PRESERVING 62 WOODLAND TREES AND 63 LANDMARK TREES TREES AND THE CONSENT JUDGMENT ALLOWS US TO CONSIDER THE OPTIONS FOR THE HISTORIC HOUSE ON THE PROPERTY AND I APPRECIATE THAT WAS DISCUSSED WITH THE DEVELOPER AND THE PROPERTY OWNER, AND FACTORED INTO THE CONSENT JUDGMENT. SUBSEQUENT DISCUSSIONS WITH THE DEVELOPER ARE NOT PRECLUDED BY APPROVING THIS CONSENT JUDGMENT BUT NOT APPROVING IT DOES LEAVE US WITH MAJOR RISKS. AND GIVEN THAT WE ALSO SUPPORTED THIS APPROACH AT THE LAST MEETING ON NOVEMBER 4, I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE DO SO AGAIN. THANKS.
05:05:10.243: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
05:05:12.078: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. YOU KNOW, I -- I UNDERSTAND THAT NEIGHBORS HAVE FOUGHT PASSIONATELY FOR THIS PIECE OF LAND, AND WHILE I RESPECT THAT, I CERTAINLY CAN'T -- YOU KNOW, I DO NEED TO SUPPORT THE CONSENT JUDGMENT THIS EVENING, AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I FEEL BADLY ABOUT FOR THE NEIGHBORS HONESTLY IS I BELIEVE THAT SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE MISLED YOU IN THE REALITY OF WHAT SOME ALTERNATIVES COULD BE. YOU KNOW, SPENDING, $4.76 MILLION ON THIS PIECE OF LAND TO BUY IT AS A PARK WOULD WIPE UTILITY OUT ALMOST 80% OF OUR PARKLAND ACQUISITION FUNDS THIS WE NEED TO USE OVER THE NEXT 15 YEARS. FOR $4.76 MILLION, THAT'S $661,000 AN ACRE, THAT'S $83,000 OF LANDMARK TREE. EVEN FOR PLANTING EXPENSIVE TREES FOR $4.76 MILLION, WE COULD PLANT 2380 15-FOOT INDUSTRIES BY MY BACK OF THE ENVELOPE TREES. WHEN WE THINK ABOUT USING OUR RESOURCES, I HAVE A DUTY TO THIS CITY AND TO -- TO SPEND THOSE RESOURCES WISELY. AND TO PROTECT THE TAXES THAT WE ALL PAY AND THE MONEY THAT VOTERS SPENT WHEN THEY APPROVED A MILLAGE FOR PARKLAND ACQUISITION THE. JUST BECAUSE IT HAPPENS TO BE SITTING THERE DOESN'T MEAN WE BLOW IT ON ONE 8-ACRE PARCEL OF LAND. I THINK IT'S UNFAIR TO EVERYONE ELSE IN THE CITY TO THINK THAT THIS ONE PARCEL IS NOT WORTH USING IT FOR ANY PARKLAND FOR GENERATIONS TO COME FOR LAND ALONG THE RIVER, FOR LAND THAT COULD HELP US GET A LOT OF CONNECTIVITY, AND ACCESS TO OUR EXISTING PARKS, PARTICULARLY WHEN THIS AREA IS SO WELL-SERVED BY PARKS, RIGHT ON EITHER SIDE. IT JUST -- I UNDERSTAND THAT'S NOT POPULAR WITH THE NEIGHBORS, BUT THAT REALLY DID PLAY A ROLE IN MY DECISION. I HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THAT IMPORTANT RESOURCE ALLOCATION AND ALSO I THINK YOU WERE PROMISED OTHER SOURCES OF FUNDING THAT ARE SO RESTRICTED THEY WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO BE USED FOR THIS PROPERTY. THAT'S JUST FANTASY TO THINK THAT NATURAL RESOURCE TRUST FUND MONIES COULD BE USED WHEN IT TAKES TO YEARS AND THAT AS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. THAT'S NOT -- AT BEST CASE SCENARIO, IT'S NOT MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO PURCHASE THIS LAND. OR THAT WE WOULD -- THAT WE WOULD ASSESS -- THAT WE WOULD ASK YOUR NEIGHBORS TO ASSESS THEMSELVES TO BUY THIS PROPERTY, WE HAVE NEVER DONE THAT IN THE CITY FOR A REALLY GOOD REASON. AND I DON'T THINK SO THIS IS THE TOO I AM TO BE MAKING THOSE DECISIONS AT THE TABLE. THAT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD WANT YOUR INPUT ABOUT AND NOT -- NOT ANYTHING THAT I THINK IS FAIR. -- SO I REALLY -- I UNDERSTAND THAT MANY PEOPLE DISAGREE WITH ME. I TOOK THESE ITEMS INTO CONSIDERATION, THE STORMWATER MITIGATION, AND THE EQUITY OF THE PARKLAND AND THE EQUITY FOR, YOU KNOW, USING THOSE RESOURCES IN CITY SO EVERYONE CAN ENJOY THEM. I KNOW THIS IS NOT POPULAR. I KNOW NEIGHBORS WILL BE ANGRY WITH ME. I ACCEPT THAT. I UNDERSTAND THAT AS PART OF THIS JOB, YOU CAN'T MAKE EVERYONE MAPY. HAPPY. THINK THINK IS MY FIDUCIARY DUTY TO THE CITY.
05:09:01.774: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
05:09:02.675: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE CONSENT JUDGMENT TONIGHT. WITH NO SMILE ABOUT IT. I  -- WE STARTED THIS PROCESS IN 2016, BEFORE FEBRUARY OF 2019. WE SAW THE R1E ZONING DISTRICT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE SMALLER HOUSES, NOT LARGER HOUSES IN OUR -- IN OUR CONSTITUENTS' BACKYARDS. AND WHEN THE DEVELOPER BROUGHT FORWARD A PLAN THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD IMPACT NEGATIVELY AND TO A GREATER DEGREE THAN ANYONE ANTICIPATED, THESE LARGE OLD TREES, WE READILY REJECTED THAT PROPOSAL. AND WE DID SO BECAUSE WE SAW THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET SMALLER HOUSES, YOU KNOW, IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD, NOT 6,000 SQUARE FOOT McMANSIONS AND THEN ALSO NEGOTIATE FOR BETTER PROTECTION OF THESE NATURE FEATURES, BUTYLENBUTTHEN THERE WAS OBSCURF LAW AND THAT PUTS US IN THE PRETEAROUS SITUATION THAT WE ARE IN. A SPEAKER USED AN ANALOGY TO A GUN AND I DON'T REALLY LIKE ANALOGIES TO GUNS, BUT THE PROBLEM HERE IS THAT WE HAVE TWO DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS, WIELDING THIS WEAPON TO CLEAR CUT THE TREES. WE HAVE MR. HEISSLER AND MR. WEBER AND THAT'S SO MUCH RISK WE ARE INSERTING INTO THE SITUATION. AND IF OUR PRIMARY GOAL IS TO SAVE THE HIGHEST QUALITY, THE OLDEST, THE LARGEST, TREES, THIS IS THE ONLY GUARANTEE. THERE'S NOT A SINGLE OTHER GUARANTEE. THERE IS NO OTHER GUARANTEE. WE CAN'T GO BACK AND OFFER -- THAT SHIP HAS STALED. SAILED.THIS IS THE OPTION BEFORD WE ARE IN THE TOUGH POSITION AS LEGISLATORS TO VOTE YES OR NO. THERE ISN'T ANY DESIGN, THE PERFECT ALTERNATIVE EXIT STRATEGY WE GET A YES OR NO. THAT'S WHERE WE ARE TONIGHT.
05:11:48.207: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
05:11:49.442: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES, THANKS MR. MAYOR. YEAH, I'M -- I'M SORRY FOR THE RESIDENTS WHO VIEW THIS AS AN END RUN AROUND THE 8 VOTE REQUIREMENT THAT THEY DRUG THEYD TO PUT INTO PLACE, SIX VOTES TO APPROVE A CONSENT JUDGMENT IS THE SAME AS 8 VOTES TO APPROVE THE PUD AND THE SITE PLAN -- TO APPROVE THE SITE PLAN AND THE PUD LAST WEEK. I'M SORRY THAT'S HOW THESE MACHINATIONS HAVE COME ABOUT. IT'S VERY UNFORTUNATE. AND THEN I JUST WANT TO SAY, I GOT A GLIMPSE AT MR. McGAIRA'S ASSESSMENT AND HE -- HE MADE SOME SERIOUS ASSUMPTIONS WITH THOSE CALCULATIONS THAT WERE NOT IN KEEPING WITH MY EXPERIENCE OF FOLKS THAT -- OF THE DIVERSITY OF TYPE OF FOLKS WHO LIVE HERE IN ANN ARBOR. YOU KNOW, HIS ASSUMPTIONS WERE INSTEAD OF DRIVING FROM DETROIT EVERY DAY, THEY WILL BE LIVING HERE AND THERE WERE NO CALCULATIONS FOR -- IT WAS AS IF THEY WERE NEVER GOING TO DRIVE ANYWHERE ONCE THEY WERE HERE AND THERE WAS JUST ALL SORTS OF ASSUMPTIONS IN THOSE CALCULATIONS THAT I DISAGREE WITH AND THAT DOESN'T REALLY PLAY A ROLE IN MY DECISION TONIGHT, BUT I JUST -- I THINK THAT THESE -- THE IDEA THAT A HOUSE IS BETTER THAN NO HOUSE, LIVING HERE IS BETTER THAN LIVING SOME PLACE ELSE, IT MAKES THE ASSUMPTION THAT YOU ARE LIVING HERE, YOU ARE TAKING THE BUS AND THE BIKE, AND NOT DRIVING YOUR CAR. ALL OF THOSE ASSUMPTIONS WERE MA HIS CALCULATIONS AND THAT'S JUST NOT A FACT. I HAVE TONS OF NEIGHBORS WHO LIVE HERE AND COMMUTE TO DETROIT OR LIVONIA OR OTHER PLACES. AND SO THERE'S ALL KINDS OF CARBON BEING KICKED OUT IN SOUTHEASTERN MICHIGAN. WITH WE ARE NOT AN ISLAND. I JUST THOUGHT THAT HIS -- YOU KNOW, HIS ASSESSMENT WAS DONE TO PROVE HIS POINT, AND I'M NOT SURPRISED BY THAT. SO WE'LL GET ON WITH VOTE, BUT I'M DISAPPOINTED IN THE WAY THIS IS -- THIS HAS COME OUT AND I REGRET THAT I WAS NOT AT THE TABLE EARLIER TO HEAD OFF THIS POOR DECISION.
05:14:00.840: >> Mayor Taylor: FOURTHers DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER?
05:14:03.776: >> Councilmember Bannister:  I WOULD TO CLARIFY SOME OF THE MISUNDERSTANDING AMONGST SOME OF THESE COMMENTS I HEARD FROM MY COLLEAGUES RIGHT NOW. FIRST, WITH CHIP, YOU KNOW, COUNCILMEMBER SMITH, WHEN HE'S SAYING THAT THE 51 HOUSES HELP WITH -- HELP WITH THE CARBON SEQUESTRATION, THERE'S A LOT BETTER TO PUT THOSE 51 HOUSES. FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE THE SEARS BRIERWOOD LOCATION. WE HAVE THE -- THE ABANDONED AUTO DEALERSHIP ON STADIUM OVER BY HOLIDAYS RESTAURANT. IT'S TIME TO GET CREATIVE AND THINK OF AREAS THAT ARE ALREADY COVERED IN ASPHALT, WHERE WE COULD BUILD THE HOMES INSTEAD, AND RETAIN OUR WOODLAND FORESTS. AS FAR AS THIS IDEA THAT WE'RE AT GREAT PERIL AND RISK, A COUPLE OF YOU MENTIONED THAT. I HAVE SPOKEN TO THE -- TO THE OWNER ON THREE OCCASIONS. IF WE HAD A PURCHASE AGREEMENT. IF WE WERE WILLING TO BUY THE PROPERTY, THAT THAT WOULD BE AN ACCEPTABLE SOLUTION. SO WE ARE NOT AT RISK. SO THE QUESTION IS PIECING TOGETHER THE SOURCES OF FUNDING. BACK TO COUNCILMEMBER GRAND'S THING THAT THE MICHIGAN NATURAL RESOURCE TRUST FUND ISN'T GOING TO BAIL US OUT, NO, BUT THEY ARE A PART OF THE PIECES. THAT WE CAN PIECE IT ALL TOGETHER. AND HAVE THIS WORK OUT IN THE RIGHT DECISION. AGAIN, I WANT TO UNDERLINE THAT I THINK THIS IS A REALLY TRAGIC MISTAKE AND TO REMOVE -- TO CLEAR CUT THIS LOT FOR SOME $400,000 HOMES IS -- WE CAN DO BETTER. AND I REALLY TAKE SERIOUSLY WHEN 81% OF THE NEIGHBORS AND GROWING. THEY KNOW THE AREA. THEY -- THEY ARE ADVISING US AND I THINK WE WOULD DO WELL TO LISTEN TO THEM.
05:16:16.042: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN AND THEN RAMLAWI.
05:16:21.881: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. WE ARE 11 MEMBERS A BOARD THAT REPRESENT A ONE STAKEHOLDER AND A SET OF PROPERTY OWNERS IN A 29 SQUARE MILE CITY OF PRIVATE PROPERTIES. WE -- WE'RE NOT MONARCHS. WE DON'T GET TO DECIDE IF MR. EISLER PICKS UP AND GOES TO THE DEFUNCT SEARS IN BRIARWOOD. THESE ARE NOT REAL OPTIONS. THESE ARE NOT REAL OPPORTUNITIES. -- WE HAVE REALITIES IN FRONT OF US TONIGHT AND WE CAN DO. THE ONE SMALL MEASURE WE CAN TO PROTECT THESE TREES TONIGHT OR WE CAN CHASE FANTASIES OF HELPING MR. HEISSLER BUILD A SUBDIVISION IN BRIARWOOD'S PARKING LOT. IT'S A PLACE TO BE BUT IT'S WHERE WE ARE AND TOUGH DECISIONS HAVE TO BE MADE. THIS IS NOT AN EASY JOB. THANKS.
05:17:36.956: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
05:17:37.823: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, MAYOR TAYLOR. I WILL TRY TO MAKE SENSE AT 12:20 IN THE MORNING. MY COUNCIL MEMBERS HAVE SPOKEN WELL TO, GRAND, ACKERMAN, LUMM, AND OTHERS VOICES THEIR OPPOSITION FOR THIS. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF GREAT CHOICES TO MAKE. WE ARE AT THE END OF THE LINE HERE. WE HAVE TAKEN TO THE 11 11th HOUR. YES, THOSE OTHER SITES ARE GREAT TO BUILD. IT WOULD BE GREAT IF THE OWNER OF BRIARWOOD WOULD WANT TO PUT HOUSING THERE. THAT'S NOT WHAT WE ARE VOTING ON RIGHT NOW. WE ARE VOTING ON WHETHER TO SPEND OR NOT SPEND THE TYPE OF MONEY THAT'S BEING ASKED FOR THIS PROPERTY. $4.7 MILLION. NEARLY $4.8 MILLION IS FOUR TIMES THE APPRAISED VALUE OF THIS LAND. IN THE -- AT THE END OF THE DAY, WE ARE A BOARD RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CITY'S ASSETS, AND TAX DOLLARS. YES, WE HAVE A $6 MILLION RESERVE IN THE GREEN BELT MILLAGE. THAT DOESN'T GIVE US THE RIGHT TO OVERPAY FOR THIS PROPERTY. I'M SORRY THAT FOLKS WON'T APPRECIATE MY POSITION ON, THIS BUT I HAVE TO BR BELIEVE THIS IS THE BEST OPTION WE HAVE. WE DIDN'T CREATE THIS. THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH. YOU KNOW, I CANNOT SUPPORT SPENDING THAT KIND OF MONEY ON 7.7 ACRES OF LAND. WE HEARD THE CALLS FROM OUR COMMUNITY THAT THEY WANT MORE PROPERTY PURCHASES WITH THAT MILLAGE MONEY WITHIN OUR CITY. I AGREE. I'M NOT AGAINST PURCHASING PROPERTY WITHIN OUR CITY BECAUSE OF THE LIABILITIES ATTACHED WITH THE MAINTENANCE. I SAY, WE'LL FIND THE MONEY. BUT FRANKLY THIS IS JUST -- IF I VOTED TO PAY $4.76 MILLION FOR THIS LAND, I SHOULD BE VOTED OUT OF OFFICE. AND I WILL STAND BY THAT WORD TODAY.
05:20:15.314: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? I TOO AM GOING TO BE VOTING IN FAVOR OF THE CONSENT -- THE CONSENT JUDGMENT. THE SEQUENCES OF VOTING AGAINST THE CONSENT JUDGMENT WILL BE -- WILL BE THE PROPERTY OWNER OR THE DEVELOPERS CLEAR CUTTING OF THE LAND. AND THEN THE SUBMISSION OF A BUY RIGHT DEVELOPMENT, WHICH WILL HAVE NONE OF THE FEATURES OF THE PUD. THE PUD IS, I BELIEVE, A COMPROMISE POSITION. IT'S ONE WHICH PRESERVES MUCH OF THE TREES. IT'S ONE THAT WILL HAVE THE BENEFIT AND I UNDERSTAND THAT. I WOULD LIKE TO TOUCH BRIEFLY UPON THE CLIMATE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS. OUR URBAN FOREST PROVIDES TREMENDOUS BENEFITS AND PROVIDES STORMWATER BENEFITS AND AIR QUALITY IMPROVEMENT, SHADE, BEAUTY, AND I DON'T YIELD TO ANYONE, MY SUPPORT FOR THEM. I'M VERY PROUD TO HAVE LED THE EFFORT TO FUND OUR URBAN FORESTRY MANAGEMENT PLAN. WE PLANT 1,000 TREES A YEAR AB WE PUT THE 50,000 TREES ON A PRUNING CYCLE TO KEEP THEM HEALTHY AND STRONG AND THE FUNDING FOR THAT PLAN ARE MUCH STRONGER THAN THEY HAVE BEEN FOR YEARS. THE T OF COURSE, SEQUESTER CO2, BUT IT'S -- AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT THAT SEQUESTRATION FOR THIS NUMBER OF TREES IS NOT PARTICULARLY IMPACTFUL. THAT'S SIMPLE. THE SEQUESTRATION IS MOST BENEFICIAL FOR TREES THAT ARE YOUNGER, BETWEEN 20 AND 50 YEARS. FACT IS THAT AUTOMOBILES CAUSE A TREMENDOUS C.O.2 LOAD. THERE ARE 411 GRAMS OF CO2 PER MILE. THAT IS IF YOU AVOID TRAVELING 55 MILES IN YOUR CAR. YOU AVOIDED EMITTING THE CARBON EMISSION THAT WILL BE SEQUESTERS BY ONE TREE IN ONE YEAR. THERE'S 184 TREES OPEN THE TREEE PROPERTY CUT DOWN AND THE LOST IS APPROXIMATELY 9200 POUNDS PER YEAR. I THINK COUNCIL MEMBER INN HAD AER IS RIGHT. -- COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, IS RIGHT, YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE PEOPLE DRIVE. IF YOU ASSUME A TWO MILE LESKO S COMMUTE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO SEND THEM FROM DEERBORN, BUT IMAGINE THAT PEOPLE ARE LIVING ON THE BOARDER OF ANN ARBOR WAITING TO DRIVE INTO TOWN, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A COMMUTE DOWNTOWN FROM THAT LOCATION, AND THIS LOCATION IS ABOUT TWO MILES. IF YOU ASSUME THEREFORE, A FOUR-MILE SHORTER COMMUTE EVERY DAY FOR EVERYBODY THAT LIVES IN THIS AREA, THAT'S 42,500 POUNDS OF CARBON EACH YEAR A SUBSTANTIAL DIFFERENCE FROM A CARBON PERSPECTIVE THAN THE SEQUESTRATION AFFORDED BY THESE TREES. NO ONE LIKES HAVING TREES CUT DOWN AND NO ONE LIKES HAVING TREES LOST, AND NO ONE LIKES DISAPPOINTING HARD-WORKING NEIGHBORHOOD LOVING PEOPLE WHO LIVE NEAR THIS PROPERTY. ABOUBUT THE BEST OF THOSE LIMITD SET OF OPTIONS IS TO VOTE YES ON THE CONSENT JUDGMENT. FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
05:24:10.649: >> Councilmember Grand: YES.
05:24:11.250: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES.
05:24:13.685: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
05:24:14.186: >> Councilmember Eaton: YES.
05:24:14.786: >> Councilmember Nelson:  YES.
05:24:17.089: >> Councilmember Smith: YES.
05:24:17.689: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES.
05:24:19.791: >> Councilmember Hayner:  NO.
05:24:20.392: >> Councilmember Bannister: NO.
05:24:22.594: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES.
05:24:25.764: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES.
05:24:26.365: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION CARRIES.
05:24:29.268: >> Mayor Taylor: DC-4, RESOLUTION DIRECTING THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR TO COLLABORATE WITH THE ANN ARBOR HOUSING COMMISSION TO PROVIDE COORDINATING ATHAT WILL SIS THE FEASIBILITY OF THE PROPERTY AT 2857 PACKARD AS A POTENTIAL LOCATION FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING MOVED BY BANNISTER AND GRISWOLD. BANISTER?
05:24:51.223: >> Councilmember Bannister: IN MY DISCUSSION WITH THE OWNER, HE SUGGESTED THAT -- OR WE TALKED ABOUT THAT WE WOULD BUY THE PROPERTY, NONE OF THE TREES WOULD BE CUT DOWN. SO I JUST WANT TO UNDERLINE THIS WHOLE BUSINESS ABOUT WE'RE GOING TO CUT DOWN THE TREES. NO, WE DON'T HAVE TO CUT DOWN THE TREES. SO IF WE BUY THE PROPERTY, THERE'S HALF A DOZEN SOURCES OF FUNDING THAT HAVE EMERGED AND ONE OF THEM, A TIMELY FOR TONIGHT, IS AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IT IS ALONG A TRANSIT LINE. IT WOULD BE HORMONOUS WITH THE NEIGHBORS. IT WOULD BE HIGH DEMAND BECAUSE IT WOULD BE LOVELY TO LIVE AMONGST THIS BEAUTIFUL 265 TREES INCLUDING 57 BURR OAK. SO I'M ASKING MY COLLEAGUES TO -- JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE APPROVED THE CONSENT JUDGMENT, HOW THAT -- MY UNDERSTANDING HOW THAT WORKS IS THAT WE STILL CAN ENTERTAIN SOLUTIONS THAT THE OWNER AND THE DEVELOPER DON'T HAVE TO TALK TO US AND THEY CAN GO ON AHEAD AND BUILD THEIR PROPERTY NOW, HOWEVER IF WE WANT TO MAKE SUGGESTIONS -- IDEAS AND SUGGESTIONS TO THEM, THEY MAY OUR PHONE CALL AND SO THAT IS WHY I'M SUGGESTING TO YOU ALL THAT WE CONSIDER THIS LOCATION ALONG THE TRANSIT LINE, AS ALL YOU NEED TO DO TO APPROVE THIS PARTICULAR RESOLUTION IS TO SAY THAT OUR ADMINISTRATION CONSIDER COLLABORATE WITH JENNIFER HALL WITH THE USING COMMISSION TO DISCUSS AN ANALYSIS OF WHETHER IT'S FEASIBLE TO HAVE AFFORDABLE HOUSING ON THIS LOCATION. THANK YOU.
05:26:51.777: >> Mayor Taylor: DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER NELSON?
05:26:52.844: >> Councilmember Nelson: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR? I'M VERY SYMPATHETIC TO COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER'S PASSION AND SINCE WE DISCUSSED THIS BRIEFLY LAST NIGHT AT CAUCUS, WE HAVE GOTTEN COMMUNICATION FROM OUR CITY ATTORNEY THAT MAKE ME FEEL OKAY VOTING FOR THE CONSENT JUDGMENT, AS WELL AS SUPPORTING COUNCISUPPORTING CO COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER'S RESOLUTION. I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY HARM IN SUPPORTING THIS AND I THINK IT'S PROBABLY THE -- THE LEAST OF ALL GESTURES WE COULD POSSIBLY MAKE IN ACKNOWLEDGING THE -- THE FRUSTRATION OF THE SITUATION ON BEHALF OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD. THANK YOU.
05:27:46.698: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM AND THEN GRAND.
05:27:48.400: >> Councilmember Lumm: I CONCUR WITH THE SENTIMENT ARTICULATED BY COUNCILMEMBER NELSON. IT WAS WELL PUT. I AP APPRECIATE THE EMAIL FROM Y McDONALD ABOUT THE CONSENT JUDGMENT ON 2750 PACKARD AND THIS RESOLUTION. I TOO WAS A BIT CONFUSED AND I APPRECIATE THE CLARIFICATION. I ALSO APPRECIATE YOUR PASSION FOR LOOKING AT ALL THE POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVES FOR HOW THIS PROPERTY IS PRESERVES OR DEVELOPED AND THIS RESOLUTION DOES DIRECT THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR TO INFORM COUNCIL HOW IT COULD OBTAIN AND PURCHASE THE PROPERTY. IT DOES NOT DIRECT THE MANAGER TO PURCHASE THE PROPERTY. DIRECTING THE ACTUAL PURCHASE OF THE PROPERTY, I WOULD NOT SUPPORT THAT WITHOUT KNOWING THE PRICE, AND OPTIMISTIC, KNOWING WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE NEGOTIATIONS AND WHAT THE DEVELOPER AND THE PROPERTY OWNER HAVE OFFERED AS THE PURCHASE PRICE AND WHAT THEY WILL AND WILL NOT ACCEPT, I'M NOT TERRIBLY OPTIMISTIC THAT THAT PRICE IS GOING TO COME DOWN AND I TOO THINK IT'S IRRESPONSIBLE TO PAY THREE TIMES WHAT WE KNOW THIS IS WORTH. AND MY VOTE AT THE LAST MEETING INDICATED THAT I WILL VOTE FOR THE CITY TO PURCHASE PROPERTY IN AN AMOUNT SIGNIFICANTLY OVER WHAT THE PROPERTY IS WORTH, REGARDLESS OF THE REASON. TO ME, THAT'S JUST NOT FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE, AND I TRUE MY ROLE AS A STEWARD, IT'S MY JOB ONE RESPONSIBILITY. SO SINCE DC-4 DOES NOT DIRECT THE PURCHASE, HOWEVER, BUT SIMPLY DIRECTS THE ADMINISTRATOR TO INFORM COUNCIL HOW WE GO ABOUT THE PURCHASE AND PAYING FOR IT, I DON'T SEE ANY REAL ISSUES WITH THAT.
05:30:03.468: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. GRAND.
05:30:04.469: >> Councilmember Grand: EARLIER WE HEARD FROM JENNIFER HALL ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING ABLE TO PUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING ON A SITE THAT DOESN'T HAVE SIGNIFICANT CARRYING COST AND HOW THAT ENABLES -- YOU KNOW, YOU HOUSING AUTHORITIES AND OTHER GROUPS THAT WANT TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING CAN ACCESS THE LOW-INCOME TAX CREDITS WHICH IS THE BIGGEST SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR A PROJECT LIKE THAT. I WOULD ARGUE THAT THERE IS ACTUALLY HARM TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD IN PASSING THIS, IN THAT I THINK IT JUST STRINGS NEIGHBORS ALONG WITH SYMBOLIC YET LIKE ANOTHER FANTASY THAT ISN'T GOING TO COME TO TRUEITION. WE KNOW THAT -- FRUITION. WE KNOW THAT THE DEVELOPER WANTS $4.76 MILLION FOR THIS PROPERTY AND WE KNOW THEREFORE THAT IT MIGHT -- IT MIGHT BE THE SHORTEST ASSESSMENT EVER, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, $4.76 MILLION, NO, NEXT. WE HAVE OTHER -- WE SO MANY OTHER PROJECTS THAT I'M SO PROUD OF PROF PUSHING THEM FORWARD ANI THINK IT'S GOING TO ACTUALLY -- IT HAS A CHANCE OF RESULTING IN REAL HOUSING. I THINK IT'S ALSO TRUE THAT THEY DIDN'T WANT A LOT OF DENSITY ON THIS PROPERTY AND SO I CAN'T IMAGINE NEIGHBORS REALICAL ENMASS EXBRACING 150 UNITS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. I WILL ARGUE THAT THERE IS A HARM AND I THINK THERE'S THIS HARM IN -- GOSH, YOU ARE HERE AT 12:30 AT NIGHT. I DON'T WANT TO MAKE YOU DO THAT AGAIN FOR SOMETHING THAT I DON'T -- I DON'T THINK IS GOING TO ACTUALLY COME FORWARD. SO I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND WHAT MY MOTIVATION IS FOR VOTING NO.
05:31:56.281: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER SMITH.
05:31:57.415: >> Councilmember Smith: FIRST OF ALL, I WOULD LIKE TO THANK COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER FOR THITHINKING AGGRESSIVELY IN HOWO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE ISSUES. I THINK THE EFFORT TO TRY TO FIND A SOLUTION IS COMMENDABLE. I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS, AND I WILL TELL YOU WHY, IS, YOU KNOW, GOING DOWN THIS PATH GIVES THE POM TO WEIGH IN ON A POTENTIALLY VERY SIGNIFICANT PORTION. YOU KNOW, THE FIRST PUBLIC DISCUSSION OF US BUYING THIS PROPERTY CAME AFTER MIDNIGHT TWO WEEKS AGO, WHICH I THOUGHT WAS NOT PARTICULARLY TRANSPARENT AND NOT PARTICULARLY INCLUSIVE. IF WE ARE GOING TO CONSIDER SPENDING YOU KNOW MORE THAN $1 MILLION TO ACQUIRE THIS PROPERTY AND TRY TO NEGOTIATE WITH THIS PROPERTY OWNER, AND IF POTENTIALLY WE ARE PAYING ABOVE APPRAISED VALUES, I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC DISCUSSION OF THAT EXPENDITURE AND I THINK THIS IS THE MECHANISM TO HAVE THAT DISCUSSION. HOWEVER, LIKE COUNCILMEMBER GRAND NOTED, THIS ALSO MIGHT BE A VERY SHORT ASSESSMENT. YOU KNOW, THE PROPERTY OWNER MIGHT CHANGE THEIR MIND. BUT I DON'T MIND GOING DOWN THIS BECAUSE I THINK IT'S THE ONLY WAY WE HAVE THE PUBLIC DISCUSSION ABOUT SPENDING -- POTENTIALLY SPENDING AN AMOUNT OF MONEY THIS LARGE ON THIS PROPERTY.
05:33:25.103: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
05:33:25.970: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I APPRECIATE THE WORDS BEING SPOKEN ON THIS YOU KNOW, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, I GOT BATTLE FATIGUE. I FEEL FOR MY COLLEAGUES THAT HAVE BEEN HERE LONGER THAN I HAVE ON THIS ISSUE. I AGREE WITH COUNCILMEMBER GRAND, WE ARE GIVING FALSE HOPE, AND FALSE PROMISE, AND GO AS FAR TO SAY IT'S A GOOSE CHASE. I THINK WE HAVE OTHER THINGS TO ADDRESS IN OUR CITY. AND FRANKLY, OUR CITY ADMINISTRATOR GETS PAID A LOT OF MONEY. STAFF GETS PAID A LOT OF MONEY. EVERYONE HAS GOT SIX FIGURE SALARIES. I MEAN, WE CAN ENTERTAIN, BUT I THINK IT COMES AT AN OPPORTUNITY COST AND WHEN PEOPLE SAY THERE'S NO COST ASSOCIATED, THERE'S A COST ASSOCIATED, I'M SORRY. THERE'S ONLY 40 HOURS IN A WORKWEEK. YOU KNOW, AND 24 HOURS IN A DAY. AND AS LONG AS WE CONTINUE TO GO ON THESE REALLY -- I MEAN, THIS HAS -- FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND -- FROM ALL THE CLOSED DISCUSSIONS, FROM ALL THE CLOSED MEETINGS, FROM ALL THE CONVERSATIONS WE HAVE HAD, IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THAT'S WHERE WE SHOULD BE PUTTING THE EFFORTS OF THE ADMINISTRATOR IN OUR OPINION, AND THAT'S WHY I HAVE A HARD TIME SUPPORTING THIS BECAUSE IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE ANY CHANCE OF ACHIEVING THE GOALS THAT ARE SET OUT. I'M SORRY. I'M JUST -- I'M JUST -- I DON'T KNOW. I JUST -- I GUESS I'M A PESSIMIST, PERHAPS.
05:34:59.864: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
05:35:02.000: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WANT TO LET EVERYONE KNOW I'M SUPPORTING MY COLLEAGUE IN THIS. SHE PUT IN A LOT OF HOURS AND THE NEIGHBORS AND THE STAFF AND AT HOME DOING RESEARCH. I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO COMPARE THIS TO, BUT I SIT NEXT TO HERE. I SEE THE INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF NOTES AND WORK SHE GOES INTO. WHY NOT? LET THEM HAVE THAT ASK. WE HAD DIFFICULTY COMING TO A CONSENSUS ABOUT OTHER ASKS AROUND THIS PROPERTY, AND SO I DON'T SEE THE HARM. IT MIGHT BE A VERY SHORT ASK. MS. HALL IS VERY CAPABLE OF COMING TO THESE CONCLUSIONS AND, YOU KNOW, I KNOW IT'S UNUSUAL, IN THAT ALL THE OTHER ONES WERE CITY-OWNED PROPERTIES AND THIS IS A WANNABE CITY-OWNED PROPERTY AND I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT. I THANK HER FOR ALL THE EFFORTS SHE PUT IN ON THIS ROE JECT?
05:35:48.613: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I SEE THIS RESOLUTION AS BEING PROACTIVE. WE HAVE TO ADMIT THAT THE ECONOMY IS CYCLICAL. WE ARE IN UNCHARTERED WATER RIGHT NOW WITH OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WE HAVE SEEN MANY, MANY DEVELOPMENTS IN THIS COMMUNITY WHERE WE HAVE A RELATIVELY STABLE REAL ESTATE MARKET FAIL, LOWER TOWN. JUST LOOK THERE. WE HAVE MANY PLACES WHERE DEVELOPMENTS HAVE NOT SUCK SOLDIERSUCCEEDEDAND THIS IS ONEE PROACTIVE, JUST IN IS CATEGORY. THANK YOU.
05:36:25.350: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
05:36:28.586: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  I WILL BE VOTING FOR THIS FOR THE REASONS REASONS ARTICULATED BY MR. SMITH. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE AN ASSESSMENT OF THIS IN THE PUBLIC EYE, BUT TO AB PUT NUMBES AROUND THE FEASIBILITY OR NOT FEASIBILITIES. IT'S WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT TO PAY FOR A PIECE OF PROPERTY IN THE P2 ZONING DISTRICT, BUT A DENSITY RING OUTSIDE OF THE CAR DENSITY. TO GET THE KIND OF RETURN YOU WOULD NEED TO BE SPENDING ON $5 MILLION FOR A PIECE OF PROPERTY, YOU WOULD BE LOOKING AT A DEVELOPMENT OF HUNDREDS OF UNITS AND THAT'S  AN AGGRESSIVE THING TO POSITION TO NEIGHBORS. SO I'M HAPPY TO DO IT. I THINK IT'S WORTH IT TO DO IT, YOU KNOW, ABOVE -- ABOVE BOARD, AND IN THE OPEN.
05:37:37.188: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION.
05:37:38.489: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES, I WANTED TO CLARIFY AGAIN, THAT I'M NOT ASKING JENNIFER HALL OR THE HOUSING COMMISSION TO SPEND $5 MILLION. LIKE I'M SAYING, WE CAN PIECE TOGETHER DIFFERENT SOURCES OF FUNDING AND SO IT'S NOT ANY ONE COMING -- COMING FROM ANY ONE PLACE, AND THEN IT ALSO TO THE -- YOU KNOW, WE NEED TO ENEXPLORE THE NEIGHBORS BUYING IT IF THEY WANT NOW THAT THEY KNOW MORE OF HOW TONIGHT HAS GONE AND THEN I WANT TO SAY TO COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI'S THING ABOUT WASTING OUR EXPENSIVE STAFF'S TIME, THE SYSTEM AND THE MATRIX WITH WHICH THEY JUDGE THESE PROPERTIES HAS ALREADY BEEN CREATED. SO I'M OPTIMISTIC THAT TO ADD ON A 12th PROPERTYO THE 11 THAT THEY HAVE ALREADY BEEN DOING IT TO, IS NOT A HUGE WASTE OF OUR STAFF RESOURCES.
05:38:41.886: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  IF I CAN RESPOND TO THAT.
05:38:45.390: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI. RAM R>> Councilmember Ramlawi: THOSE WERE ALL CITY-OWNED PROPERTIES TO BEGIN WITH. AND THIS -- YOU GOT A LOT OF SOURCES, UNDETERMINED SOURCES OF MONEY, THAT I'M SURE WILL HAVE MANY STRINGS ATTACHED TO THEM AS WELL. I'M JUST -- I HAVE SAID MY PIECE AND THANKFULLY I GET TO VOTE.
05:39:09.981: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER GRAND?
05:39:17.155: >> Councilmember Grand: NO.
05:39:17.755: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES.
05:39:21.492: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.

05:39:33.571: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION CARRIES.
05:39:37.208: >> Mayor Taylor: DB1, RESOLUTION TO APPROVE THE VIC VILLAGE SOUTH SITE PLAN AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT, 1100 SOUTH UNIVERSITY AVENUE. MOVED BY HAYNER AND SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN. DISCUSSION OF DB-1? COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN. ZACK THANZACK THANK YOU, THIS I0 BLOCK OF SOUTH UNIVERSITY, IT'S 130 APARTMENTS AND 150-FOOT BUILDING, 12% OF THOSE APARTMENTS, SO 1 UNITS WILL BE RESTRICT -- 14 UNITS WILL BE RESTRICTED TO PEOPLE MAKING $48,000 A YEAR OR LESS. IT ALSO INCLUDES NEARLY 2,000 SQUARE FEET OF RETAIL, AND 71 PARKING SPACES AND BELOW GROUND STRUCTURE AND IN THE ALLEY TO THE REAR. OF NOTE, THE PIECE OF THIS THAT HAS CHANGED SINCE PLANNING COMMISSION, THERE WAS DISCUSSION AT THE DESIGN REVIEW BOARD AND THE PLANNING COMMISSION TABLES ABOUT THE DESIGN OF THEIR MAIN ENTRANCE ON SOUTH UNIVERSITY AND EAST UNIVERSITY, AND IT STANDS DIRECTLY ACROSS FROM THE WEST ENGINEERING ARCH WHICH IS ONE OF THE MOST ICONIC VIEWS IN TOWN. AND THE ORIGINAL ARCHITECTURE WAS VERY ARE PLAIN AND MODEST AND DIDN'T REFLECT THAT CHARACTER. THE NEW REVISED ELEVATIONS, I THINK, ENHANCE THAT QUITE A BIT. AND SO GRATEFUL TO SEE THAT CHANGE REALIZED. SO WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THAT THAT IS A CHANGE SINCE THIS WAS HEARD AT THE PLANNING COMMISSION IN SEPTEMBER. AS WE ALL KNOW, ON NOVEMBER 4th, WE ADOPTED NEW PREMIUMS, THAT STRENGTHENED THE REQUIREMENTS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THIS WILL BE THE FIRST AND POTENTIALLY LAST OR SECOND TO LAST PROJECT THAT COMES BEFORE US THAT -- SECOND TO LAST, I SHOULD SAY, THAT USES THIS VERSION OF THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING PREMIUMS AND AT 12%, IS NOT TOO DISSIMILAR TO THE MINIMUM WE WOULD BE LOOKING FOR IN OUR NEW REQUIREMENTS ANYWAYS. BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE GAVE A GRACE PERIOD TO ALLOW PEOPLE WHO HAD INVESTED, YOU KNOW, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN PLANNING AND ENGINEERING TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON A PROCESS, AND A SET OF RULES WT THE BEGINNING OF THAT PROCESS. THANK YOU.
05:42:12.430: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU. SO I GUESS I WILL SHARE A COUPLE OF CONCERNS THAT I HAVE ABOUT THIS PROJECT. WE DIDN'T SEEM TO APPLY THE CHARACTER DISTRICT OVERLAY THAT'S NECESSARY FOR THIS PART OF TOWN WITH THIS BUILDING, WHICH CALLS FOR A MIX OF BILLING TYPES AND SIZES, TALL AT THE INTERIOR BLOCKS AND RETAIN A VARIETY OF SMALL SCALE RETAIL AND RESIDENTIAL AND MINIMIZE IMPACTS ON RESIDENTIAL STREETS. THOSE IMPACTS ARE LONG GONE BECAUSE OF THE PROJECT ACROSS THE STREET. THAT ONE DIDN'T HAVE IT EITHER AND THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT OKAY. I'M JUST WONDERING HOW IT IS THAT THIS GOT -- HOW IT IS THAT WE DON'T APPLY THE CHARACTER DISTRICT OVERLAYS ON THESE PROJECTS. WHAT IS THAT? WHY DO WE HAVE THEM IF WE DON'T USE THEM? AND THAT'S A CONCERN I WANTED TO EXPRESS PUBLICLY. YEAH, I DON'T -- I MEAN, I DON'T ON IF SOMEBODY WANTS TO ANSWER THAT, BUT I'M JUST GOING TO HANG THAT OUT THERE, AND I THINK WE HAVE CREATED THESE MECHANISMS FOR COMING UP WITH BUILDINGS THAT -- I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHERE THAT COMES FROM.
05:43:28.339: >> MATT KOWALSKI, THE CITY PLANNER WOULD REVIEWS THIS PROJECT. WE HAD THIS DISCUSSION BEFORE AT COUNCIL, AND THIS PROJECT IS COMPLIANT WITH ALL THE APPLICABLE CODES. WE DO DRAFT INTENSE SECTIONS AND MANY SECTIONS OF OUR CODE, AND THAT IS JUST THAT. IT'S JUST INTENDED TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF WHAT IS TRYING TO BE ACCOMPLISHED BY THE SUBSEQUENT CODE. ADDITIONALLY WHEN THERE'S SOME QUESTION ABOUT WHAT THAT CODE IS LANGUAGE SPECIFIES AND THERE'S SOME QUESTION ABOUT THE APPLICATION OF THAT WE WOULD GO BACK TO THE INTENSE SECTION TO CLARIFY THAT AND IN THIS CASE, I WOULD SAY THAT IF -- IF -- WELL, IF THE PROJECT DOES MEET THE CODE, I THINK WHAT YOU ARE EXPRESSING IS YOUR FRUSTRATION THAT YOU DON'T BELIEVE THE CODE REQUIREMENTS NECESSARILY MEET THE INTENT SECTION OF THAT DISTRICT.
05:44:27.965: >> Councilmember Hayner:  IT DOESN'T APPEAR CLOSE. IT'S TALL, RIGHT ON THE STREET, NO RETENTION OF THE VARIETY OF SMALL SCALE RETAIL AND RESIDENTIAL, NONE OF THOSE THINGS. YES, I GUESS THAT IS A FRUSTRATION I'M WILLING TO EXPRESS PUBLICLY AND I'M NOT A FAN OF PLUNGING THE STREETS INTO DARKNESS. I MISS MY VIEWS. THANK YOU.
05:44:55.760: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
05:44:58.395: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. THANK YOU, MR. HAYNER. I APPRECIATE YOU REMINDING US THINGS LIKE CHARACTER DISTRICT OVERLAYS, AND WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE LONG SINCE BEEN FORGOTTEN WHEN IT COMES TO SOUTH U BECAUSE WHAT WE HAVE IS ANOTHER STUDENT HIGH RISE ON SOUTH UNIVERSITY. THERE WERE NO OBJECTIONS FROM ANYONE, AND I -- I DID ASK A QUESTION ABOUT, OF COURSE, THE PARKING REQUIREMENT, BECAUSE IT'S -- WE'RE ADDING HERE 131 UNITS, AND 14 OF WHICH WILL BE AFFORDABLE AT 80% A.M. I. AND THERE ARE 110 OFFSTREET PARKING SPACES REQUIRED AND 70 ONSITE. THE D.D.A. APPROVED A REQUEST FOR 40 LIMITED OVERNIGHT PERMITS. SO MY QUESTION HAD TO DO WITH THE 40 LIMITED OVERNIGHT PERMITS IN THE FOREST AVENUE STRUCTURE, AND -- AND THE FACT THAT -- THAT THE PARKING REQUIREMENT CAN BE MET WITH THESE D.D.A. ARRANGEMENTS IN THE PUBLIC SYSTEM, AND AS I SAID IN MY QUESTION, IT SEEMS TO ME THAT LIMITED OVERNIGHT PERMITS DO NOT SATISFY THE PERMITS OR THE PARKING REQUIREMENTS CAN YOU PLEASE SPEAK TO THAT AND HOW WE CONCLUDED THAT 70, 24-HOUR PARKING SPACES WOULD SATISFY THE DEMAND. I HAVE TO SAY I THOUGHT THAT THE RESPONSE WAS A LITTLE SARCASTIC. THE RESPONSE WAS ESSENTIALLY THERE'S NO SPIRIT OR INTENT IN DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS, JUST THE RULES AND THIS MEETS THE RULES. ALSO THIS WILL DISCOURAGE FOLKS FROM HAVING CARS AND THAT AS A GOOD THING, BECAUSE IT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE RECENTLY ADOPTED CLIMATE GOAL. THE RULES ARE THE RULES, AND WE CAN DO IT THIS WAY. SO SO BE IT. AND I KNOW FROM TALKING TO THE SOUTH UNIVERSITY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR ASSOCIATION DIRECTOR THAT PARKING HAS BECOME A PROBLEM -- HAS BEEN A PROBLEM FOR SOMETIME THERE. THEY HAVE GREAT DIFFICULTY ATTRACTING TENANTS TO RETAIL SPACES BECAUSE OF NO PARKING. AND WE CONSTANTLY EXACERBATE THAT UNMET NEED AND DEMAND WHEN WE ENTER INTO THESE ARRANGEMENTS AND WE JUST TURN TO THE D.D. AX FOR USING, TAKING MORE SPACES OUT OF THE PUBLIC SYSTEM. SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS, BUT WE JUST SEEM TO BE KICKING THAT CAN DOWN THE ROAD AND NOT ADDRESSING THIS. AND WE COME UP WITH THESE OTHER, YOU KNOW, WAYS OF ADDRESSING AND MEETING THE -- THE OFF SPACE -- THE OFF STREET PARKING REQUIREMENT, AND I DON'T THINK THAT THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE SPIRIT AND INTENT OF THE REGULATIONS.
05:48:00.945: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
05:48:02.046: >> Councilmember Eaton: THANK YOU. I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS PROJECT AS WELL, BUT I WANT TO DRAW MY COLLEAGUES' AENTION TO THE 14 SO-CALLED AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS IN THIS PROJECT. ACCORDING TO THE DATA THAT WE WERE GIVEN TONIGHT, FROM OUR HOUSING DIRECTOR, 80% A.M.I. RENT FOR A SINGLE INDIVIDUAL WOULD BE $1,400 A MONTH. WE CAN CALL THAT AFFORDABLE, BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S ACTUALLY AFFORDABLE AND THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT WE BUILT INTO OUR DOWNTOWN PREMIUMS IS 80% MARK FOR AFFORDABLE RENT FOR A SINGLE INDIVIDUAL WILL BE ABOUT $1,400 A MONTH, AND THAT'S KIND OF A STUNNING AMOUNT OF MONEY TO CALL AFFORDABLE. THANK YOU.
05:48:54.865: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
05:48:55.766: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE MY COLLEAGUES' COMMENTS ON THIS, YOU KNOW, WE DID LOOK AT THE A.M.I.80% YOU KNOW, A FAMILY OF TWO OR A HOUSEHOLD OF TWO, O YOU'RE TALKG $60,000 A YEAR. THAT'S A HIGH THRESHOLD, BUT I'M JUST GOING TO, YOU KNOW, NOT DWELL ON THAT TOO MUCH. IT'S NOT TOO MUCH THAT FOLKS WHO ARE DOING THIS IS CAN -- THE A.M.I. AND THE HIGH COST OF LIVING IN THE REGION, YOU KNOW, MARKET WILL HOPEFULLY CORRECT THAT. I DO THINK THAT WE ARE IN UNCHARTERED WATERS WHEN IT COMES TO THE ASKING PRICES. MY POLICY CONCERNS ARE TO DEAL WITH THE PARKING AND THE AGREEMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN CARVED OUT WITH THE D.D.A. THAT WE CONTINUOUSLY SEE -- ALLOW FOR DEVELOPMENT WITHOUT ADEQUATE PARKING. AND I KNOW WE HAVE AMBITIOUS GOALS TO BECOME LESS CAR DEPENDENT. BUT THAT HASN'T MATERIALIZED AND SO HAVING THESE SPECIAL ARRANGEMENTS IS A HUGE CONCERN OF MINE. IT'S ONE THAT I WILL CONTINUE TO ADDRESS WITH THE -- THE D.D. AX A.AND THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR IN REFORMING. THIS NEEDS TO BE REFORMED BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST KICKING THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD. IT'S MAKING THE PROBLEM BIGGER AND WORSE. AND MORE EXPENSIVE FOR FUTURE FOLKS TO DEAL WITH. WHEN WE ARE NOT SUBSCRIBING THE TRUE COST OF PARKING TO THE DEVELOPMENTS. WE ARE PASSING IT ON TO THE PUBLIC SYSTEM, OR SOME OTHER PROPERTY OWNER OR USER OF THE SYSTEM, WHO KNOWS. BUT IT'S NOT BEING ASSOCIATED TO THE PROJECTS THEMSELVES AND IT OUGHT TO. I FIND IT TROUBLING AND I WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK AT WAYS TO SOLVE IT. AS TO THE HEIGHT AND THE DENSITY OF THE BUILDING, I GO DOWN TO THIS REGION ON ALMOST A DAILY BASIS. YOU KNOW, THE HORSES HAVE LEFT THE BARN. THIS AREA HAS CHANGED AND IT'S NOT COMING BACK TO WILL TYPE OF DISTRICT THAT PEOPLE ARE FOND OF. IT JUST IS NOT, IN MY OPINION. WE'LL SEE MORE DENSITY AND THAT'S FINE. TO BE HONEST, I WOULD RATHER SEE THESE FOLKS WOULD WOULD OTHER -- WHO WOULD OTHERWISE BE LIVING IN UNIVERSITY BILLINGS, NOT PAYING PROPERTY TAXES, BEING PUT IN BUILDINGS THAT ARE PAYING PROPERTY TAXES. SO I WELCOME THAT DEVELOPMENT. AND YOU KNOW, INCREASE THE BEDS IN OTHER SECTORS OF OUR ECONOMY.
05:51:59.883: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN. ZA>> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR.  A.M. RAW LIAISON FOR LAYING THAT OUT. IN THE TIME SINCE A LOT OF THOSE INTENSE STATEMENTS WERE WRITTEN INTO OUR CODE, SOMETHING REALLY DRAMATIC HAS HAPPENED IN THIS COMMUNITY AND THAT'S THE FACT THAT THERE ARE NOW 10,000 MORE STUDENTS ENROLLED THEY UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN THAN THEY WERE IN THE YEAR 2000. THIS' 10,000 ADDITIONAL RESIDENTS, YOUNG RESIDENTS, WHO ARE GOING TO A VERY SPECIFIC PART OF TOWN, EVERY SINGLE DAY, EVERY SINGLE YEAR. AND THAT'S NOT SOMETHING OUR CITY WAS FRANKLY BUILT FOR. AND IN RESPONSE THE M MARKET AND THE UNIVERSITY HAVE BUILT UNDER 6,000 BEDS OF NOW HOUSING. THIS' STILL A NET LOSS OF 4,0000 BEDROOMS OF HOUSING THAT ARE NOT MEETING THE NEEDS OF THE NEW STUDENT POPULATION. AND IF WE DON'T CONTINUE TO ALLOW INCREASED DENSITY IN CAMPUS WHICH IS NOW A STUDENT AREA, THE RESULT IS STUDENTS ARE GOING TO BE COMPLETING FOR HOUSING AGAINST HOMEOWNERS, STUDENTS WILL BE COMPETING FOR HOUSING AGAINST WORKING PROFESSIONALS AND IT'S IN NEIGHBORHOODS IN EVERY SINGLE WARD AND THE OLD FOURTH WARD TO WATER HILL. IT'S GOING TO BE FROM THE OLD WEST SIDE TO VIRGINIA PARK TO NORTH BURNS PARK TO SOUTH OF STADIUM. IT'S GOING TO BE FROM LOWER BURNS PARK TO SOUTH OF STIMSON. THIS IS A HUGE AMOUNT -- THIS IS A HUGE INFLUX OF STUDENT POPULATION, THAT WE JUST DON'T HAVE ENOUGH HOUSING FOR, AND THIS IS HERBING US INCREMENTAL -- IS HELPING US INCREMENTALLY PRODUCE THAT HOUSING. I THINK IT'S HELPING THE COMMUNITY. WITH RESPECT TO THE PRICE OF THE ACTUAL RENT VALUES FOR PEOPLE MAKING 80% OF A.M.I., WHICH IS $40,000. I THINK THEY GO TO TOWN. I'M A RENTER. I HAVE TO LOOK FOR NEW HOUSING EVERY YEAR OR I CHOOSE TO, TO FIND MORE FAVORABLE RATES. AND FINDING A $1,400 APARTMENT DOWNTOWN IS UNHEARD OF. WHAT THAT DOES FOR ME, I SELL MY CAR. THAT'S THE FIRST THING I DO. AND THAT BRINGS DOWN MY COST OF LIVING SIGNIFICANTLY AND WHEN I LIVE, ACTUALLY SOUTH OF HERE BY ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILE, I DIDN'T HAVE A CAR AND IT WAS GREAT AND WONDERFUL AND I GOT BY, JUST FINE. SO THESE THINGS ARE CONNECTED. THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WHEN WE UPDATED THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING PREMIUMS THAT WE LOOKED TO NOT INCLUDE -- NOT REQUIRE MARKING FOR THE AFFORDABLE UNITS BECAUSE IT HELPS PEOPLE'S MATH. IT HELPS PEOPLE'S BUDGETS ADD UP AND WHEN THEY DON'T NEED TO HAVE A CAR AND THEY GET TO PAY A LITTLE BIT LESS RENT AND SO THIS IS BETTER THAN THE M MARKET WOUD PRODUCE. I'M GLAD IT'S SOMETHING AND IT'S PROVIDING HOUSING FOR A WHOLE BUNCH OF STUDENTS THAT THAT ARE IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS AND KOHL COMPETING FOR HOUSING.
05:55:40.804: >> Mayor Taylor: PERHAPS COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER AND THEN THAT WILL BE THE SEND.
05:55:46.376: >> Councilmember Hayner:  WHEN WE CREATED THE ZONING, WHAT WE HAVE DEGREATED -- A LOT OF PEOPLE, HUSHING ON US. WE NEED MORE HOUSING AND TAKE THE LID OFF ZONING BUT WHAT WE CREATED WITH THE D1, D2, NOT ME, BUT OTHERS IS HOUSING POTENTIAL RIGHT? WE HAVE MILLIONS THE SQUARE FEET OF UNBUILT D1 AND D2, WE HAVE PROPERTIES ZONED D1 AND SINGLE STORY STRUCTURE. WE HAVE PROPERTIES ZONED D2, THEY ARE, YOU KNOW, TWO I HAVE STORY OFFICE BUILDING OR SOMETHING. SOUTH VIEW HAS SHOWED US A GLIMPSE OF WHAT D1 AND D2 WILL PROVIDE. I'M NOT A FAP OF ALL OF THAT BECAUSE IT'S MARKET RATE HOUSING. IT'S NOT CARBON NEUTRAL AND IT'S NOT AFFORDABLE ON THE WHOLE BUT THAT'S WHAT WE SET UP FOR OURSELVES. I THINK WE NEED TO TAKE GREATER STEPS IN SHIFTING THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING PREMIUMS AROUND TO TO GET THE ASHON NEUTRALITY AND THE AFFORDABILITY BUILT BACK INTO THE D1, D2 ZONING HERE. I WON'T GO OUT ON A LIMB UNTIL WE GIVE THE D1, D2 ZONING TO FILL IN, AND SEE WHAT WE ARE DOING HERE. WE HAVE LAID OUT A ZONING DESIGNATIONS THAT HAVE THE POM TO CREATE MORE THAN ENOUGH UNITS HERE IN THIS TOWN AND I KNOW THIS REPRESENTS THEM. I'M NOT A FAN OF IT, BECAUSE I THINK IT'S GETTING PRIVATE ROAD INTENSE DOWN THERE, BUT I JUST -- THIS IS WHAT -- PRETTY INTENSE DOWN THERE, BUT I JUST -- THIS IS WHAT IT'S LOOKING DOWN THERE ON SOUTH SOU.

05:58:50.627: >> GOOD EVENING, I'M LAUREN AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF ADVOCACY. I'M HERE TO EXPRESS OUR CONTINUED TO DEER KILLING IN THE CITY AS A COSTLY, INEFFECTIVE, CONTROVERSIAL AND VIOLENT MEANS OF ADDRESSING HUMAN, ANIMAL CONFLICT. TO BE CLEAR, THERE IS NO OVERPOPULATION. DEER ARE NOT STARVING. THEY ARE NOT DISEASED, NOR ARE THEY SPREADING DISEASE. AND COLLISIONS WITH DEER ARE ACTUALLY HIGHER THAN THE YEAR BEFORE CULLING BEGAN. WE SIMPLY HAVE AN ISSUE OF A SMALL GROUP OF RESIDENTS WHO SEE THEM AS A NUISANCE, AGGRAVATED BY CONTINUAL H LOSS OF HABITAT THAT MAKES THEM LIVE IN CLOSER PROXIMITY TO PEOPLE. LET'S BE CLEAR THAT LOVE THEM OR HATE THEM, URBAN DEER ARE HERE TO STAY. AS A NATIVE SPECIES WHITE TAIL DEER SURROUND OUR COMMUNITY AND LIVE THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND NOTION. SHOOTING REDUCES NUMBERS IN THE SHORT TERM BUT ALLOWS DEER FROM OUTSIDE TO MOVE IN AND BIRTH RATES TO INCREASE AS RESOURCES BECOME MORE AVAILABLE. AS A RESULT, CULLING BECOMES A GROWING AND ENDLESS ITEM ON THE CITY BUDGET AND BURDEN ON THE COMMUNITY, CAUSING FRUSTRATING PARK CLOSURES AND SETTING A BAD EXAMPLE FOR OUR CHILDREN. ANN ARBOR HAS ALWAYS STOOD FOR TOLERANCE AND KINDNESS, TEACHING YOUNG PEOPLE THE IMPORTANCE OF NONVIOLENCE. TRAGICALLY OUR YOUNG STUDENTS HAVE TO DEAL WITH SHARP SHOOTERS AND PUTTING THESE SHARP SHOOTERS. THE DNR HAS BANNED BAITING DEERS FOR FEARS OF SPREADING COL SPREC WASTING DISEASE. WE ARE RISKING HUMAN HEALTH WHILE SENDING TO LOCAL DEER TO THE FOOD BANK WHEN WE KNOW THAT PFAs ARE IN THE WATER. THE MAJORY IT OF RESIDENTS PREFER A NONVIOLENT SOLUTIONS OUR TAX DOLLARS ARE MUCH BETTER SPENT ON SITE-SPECIFIC MITIGATION EFFORTS, FENCING AND SIGNAGE THAT PREVENT LANDSCAPE DAMAGE AND COLLISIONS. BECAUSE OF THE SUCCESS OF OUR PROGRAM WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT RESIDENTS WOULD SUPPORT A ROBUST EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM, PROVIDING HUMANE AND EFFECTIVE TOOLS TO MANAGE CONFLICT. YOU HAVE LISTENED TO A VOCAL MINORITY IN FAVOR OF CULLING. MOST RESIDENT CHERISH THE PEACE AND APPRECIATE THE WILDLIFE WITHIN. ENANTIOSES TO CHAT BEFORE DOING ANY RESEARCH OR -- ANN ARBOR CHOSE TO SHOOT BEFORE DOING A RESEARCH. LET'S 2019 BE THE TOO PEACEFUL SOLUTIONS WE CAN BE PROUD TO TELL OUR CHILDREN ABOUT. THANK YOU.
06:01:17.640: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT?
06:01:26.216: >> HI. GOOD EVENING. GOOD MORNING. SUE SIGNTON, CARMEL TREAT. STREET.I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT AW THINGS. I SAT HERE FOR THREE AND A HALF HOURS AND I LISTENED TO THE AGENDA. I WENT BACK AND LOOKED AT ASYMBOLICKEN DAHS. YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT MONIES. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT MONEY AND SUPPORTING THE CITY. I RED ABOUT MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS APPROPRIATED FOR VARIOUS CAUSES AND UPKEEP OF THE CITY. I'M CONFUSED WHY WE ALLOWED $1.2 MILLION FOR THE GOLF COURSE. AND I'M A GOLFER! AND I HAVE BEEN TO THAT GOLF COURSE. SO I SUPPORT ALL OF THAT. BUT I GUESS ALL ALONG, LISTENING TONIGHT ABOUT THREE HOURS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND NET ZERO, AND THE BIG THING WITH THAT DEVELOPMENT ON 2057, AND THE ABOUT BEING DEVELOPED, IT WAS THE RIGHT DEVELOPMENT FOR THAT PROPERTY. AND I'M ONE EVER THOSE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE BEEN UP HERE COMPLAINING ABOUT SEWERS AND SEWERS AND SEWERS AND I REALLY HOPE THAT -- I REALLY DON'T WANT ANY OUTCOME FROM WHATEVER HAPPENS, WHATEVER END HAPPENING WITH THIS PROPERTY. AND I THINK I SAID MOST EVERYTHING, BUT HOW -- HOW TIMELY IT IS THAT WE HAD THIS CEREMONY LAST WEEK FOR FORMER MAYOR LOU BETCHER, 40 YEARS AGO, HE TOOK A RISK WITH THE CITY, HE STOOD UP AND TOOK A RISK AND BOUGHT MICHIGAN THEATER. HE WAS ON THE HOT SEAT FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS. AND NOW MICHIGAN THEATER IS AN INTERNATIONALLY RENOWNED VENUE. HE TOOK A RISK TO BE A STEWARD OF THE CITY AND I WISH CITY COUNCIL WOULD HAVE TAKEN A STEP TO BE STEWARDS FOR THE FUTURE GENERATIONS THAT WE HAVE. THANK YOU.
06:03:12.388: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
06:03:16.759: >> HELLO TO ALL, DAN B BILLITCH 1729 NORTH CRANBROOK. THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR SERVICE FOLK HERE AT 1:00 IN THE MORNING. I REALLY, REALLY APPRECIATE WHAT YOU GUYS DO. I DON'T AGREE WITH EVERYTHING THAT EVERYBODY DOES, BUT IT MEANS SOMETHING. I DON'T UNDERSTAND CITY GOVERNMENT. I'M NOT A LAWYER. BUT AS CITIZENS, MY FAMILY HAD A RIGHT TO FIGHT 2750 PACKARD. IT FEELS WRONG. WE FELT AND FEEL BULLIED BY THE DEVELOPER'S ATTITUDE OF WHAT FEELS LIKE CONTEMPT TOWARDS OUR NEIGHBORHOOD AND OUR CITY'S HISTORY, THE HOUSE ON THAT SITE NEEDS TO BE MENTIONED. IT'S JUST AN OLD HOUSE. IT'S JUST THE NEIGHBORS. WE GOT TOTALLY DISMISSED RIGHT FROM THE GET-GO, AND YOU HE NO, YOU KNOW,IT WILL TURN OUT THE W. BUT, AGAIN, AS CITIZENS AND AS BEING A WAKE PEOPLE WHOIVE THERE IN THAT BE NEIGHBORHOOD AND LIVE IN THAT PART OF THE CITY, I GREW UP IN GEORGETOWN AND IN AND OUT OF ANN ARBOR, BUT I SPENT A LOT MORE TIME IN THAT PART OF THE CITY THAN THE DEVELOPER OR THE PROPERTY OWNER EVER DID. IT DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT. IT STILL DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT, SO I WILL HOPE FOR DIVINE INTERVENTION. I WILL FINISH BY THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE AGAIN. MY FAMILY REALLY APPRECIATES YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
06:05:03.266: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT?
06:05:09.105: >> IF YOU ACCEPT ME, I WILL KEEP TO UNDER A MINUTE. I HAVE BEEN UP HERE ALREADY. I HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING CITY POLITICS HERE FOR FOUR OR FIVE MONTHS NOW, AND I HAVE TO SAY THAT THIS IS THE MOST SURPRISING AND I FEEL LIKE OPTIMISTIC MEETING AS DIFFICULT AS A LOT OF THINGS ARE. SO, YEAH, JUST BASED ON PAST VOTES AND STUFF BEING I'M SURPRISED THAT MOVING FORWARD THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. I WOULD LIKE TO MENTION SOME RELATED ISSUES, I THINK WE ZONE IN ON THAT, AND ABOUT COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH, AND ABOUT POLICE. YOU KNOW, WE ALL COME FROM DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS AND HAVE DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES AND THAT'S WHY IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH EACH OTHER AND HAVE TEASE IDEAS BROUGHT UP. SO REALLY QUICKLY I HAVE TWO PLUS -- OVER TWO DECADES EXPERIEN MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEMS. YOU KNOW, I DON'T NEED TO GO INTO THAT, BUT -- AND THE ONLY THING THAT I EVER HEARD MENTIONED AT ONE OF THESE MEETINGS IS TAKING MONEY AWAY FROM MENTAL HEALTH TO PUT INTO AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THAT'S HOW MUCH OF A CRISIS WE HAVE. BUT IT'S GOING TO HURT LOW-INCOME PEOPLE. AND WITH POLICE FIRST OFF, I HAVE TO SAY THE ANN ARBOR POLICE IS THE BEST POLICE FORCE I HAVE ENCOUNTERED ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY. I HAVE HAD MANY INTERACTIONS WITH POLICE. I HAD POLICE CALLED ON ME. I CALLED THE POLICE ON A LOCAL BUSINESS HERE. AND ALL THE -- SORRY, I'M TAKING TWO MINUTES. BUT, YOU KNOW, THOSE ARE THE POINT, YOU KNOW. WITH AFFORDABLE HOUSING, IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE UNITS. AND WITH THE TALK OF HIRING MORE POLICE OFFICERS, I WOULD LIKE TO -- YOU KNOW, I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF THIS IS POSSIBLE BUT INSTEAD OF POLICE OFFICERS, I BELIEVE WE NEED TO SOCIAL WORKERS THAT I DON'T KNOW IF THEY CAN WORK WITHIN THE POLICE DEPARTMENT, AND, YOU KNOW -- OR SEPARATE OR, SOME BUT THERE'S A LOT OF INCIDENTS THAT I HAVE SEEN DOWNTOWN, THAT COULD BE BETTER SERVED WITH DIFFERENT AREA OF EXPERTISE. AND NEW YORK CITY HAS BROUGHT UP -- SORRY, SORRY. I'M NOT TRUE TO MY WORD. [ BLEEP ] IT. POLICE ISSUES -- YEAH, I HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH IT. I HAVE BEEN TASED BY THE POLICE BEFORE, NOT IN ANN ARBOR. THAT'S WHAT I'M SPEAKING FROM, YOU KNOW, IT'S A BIG ISSUE, AND RESPONSIBILITY AND YOU HE NO, I WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY IN THE COMMUNITY IS PROTECTED AND THAT THERE IS PROPER OVERSIGHT. THANK YOU.

WE HAVE BEEN WORKING HARD TOO. I LEARNED A LOT. I HOPE THAT GOING FORWARD THE PROCESS WILL BE IMPROVED AND BE MORE TRANSPARENT AND MORE
