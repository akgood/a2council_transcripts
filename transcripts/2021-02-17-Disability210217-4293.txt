SO THERE'S A COUPLE DIFFERENT ADD. SO THERE'S A COUPLE DIFFERENT INCENTIVES THAT THE CITY HAS SO THERE'S A COUPLE DIFFERENT INCENTIVES THAT THE CITY HAS AVAILABLE THAT WOULD ENCOURAGE INCENTIVES THAT THE CITY HAS AVAILABLE THAT WOULD ENCOURAGE AFFORDABLE UNITS. AVAILABLE THAT WOULD ENCOURAGE AFFORDABLE UNITS. SO FOR EXAMPLE, BEAKMAN ON AFFORDABLE UNITS. SO FOR EXAMPLE, BEAKMAN ON BROADWAY WHICH WAS THE OLD 1140 SO FOR EXAMPLE, BEAKMAN ON BROADWAY WHICH WAS THE OLD 1140 OF BROADWAY SITE THAT MANY ARE BROADWAY WHICH WAS THE OLD 1140 OF BROADWAY SITE THAT MANY ARE FAMILIAR WITH, THAT USED A OF BROADWAY SITE THAT MANY ARE FAMILIAR WITH, THAT USED A BROWNFIELD INCENTIVE AND AS PART FAMILIAR WITH, THAT USED A BROWNFIELD INCENTIVE AND AS PART OF THAT BROWNFIELD SORT OF BROWNFIELD INCENTIVE AND AS PART OF THAT BROWNFIELD SORT OF NEGOTIATION THEY ASKED FOR 15 OF THAT BROWNFIELD SORT OF NEGOTIATION THEY ASKED FOR 15 AFFORDABLE UNITS.

THERE'S A SET PERCENTAGE, IF SOMEBODY WERE TO USE THAT ZONING THERE'S A SET PERCENTAGE, IF SOMEBODY WERE TO USE THAT ZONING TOOL TO GO OUTSIDE OF EXISTING SOMEBODY WERE TO USE THAT ZONING TOOL TO GO OUTSIDE OF EXISTING ZONING AND USE THE PLANNED UNIT TOOL TO GO OUTSIDE OF EXISTING ZONING AND USE THE PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT THERE, WOULD BE A ZONING AND USE THE PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT THERE, WOULD BE A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF AFFORDABLE DEVELOPMENT THERE, WOULD BE A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF AFFORDABLE UNITS THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF AFFORDABLE UNITS THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE PROVIDED AT 60% OF THE AREA UNITS THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE PROVIDED AT 60% OF THE AREA MEDIAN INCOME. PROVIDED AT 60% OF THE AREA MEDIAN INCOME. THE DOWNTOWN ZONING THAT WAS MEDIAN INCOME. THE DOWNTOWN ZONING THAT WAS CHANGED LAST YEAR WILL ALSO HAVE THE DOWNTOWN ZONING THAT WAS CHANGED LAST YEAR WILL ALSO HAVE A SIMILAR PERCENTAGE BUILT IN CHANGED LAST YEAR WILL ALSO HAVE A SIMILAR PERCENTAGE BUILT IN AND THAT VARIES A LITTLE BIT A SIMILAR PERCENTAGE BUILT IN AND THAT VARIES A LITTLE BIT JUST BASED ON WHETHER IT'S D1 OR AND THAT VARIES A LITTLE BIT JUST BASED ON WHETHER IT'S D1 OR D2 ZONING AND ALSO HOW BIG OF A JUST BASED ON WHETHER IT'S D1 OR D2 ZONING AND ALSO HOW BIG OF A HEIGHT BONUS THAT FOLKS ARE D2 ZONING AND ALSO HOW BIG OF A HEIGHT BONUS THAT FOLKS ARE LOOKING FOR, THERE'S CERTAIN HEIGHT BONUS THAT FOLKS ARE LOOKING FOR, THERE'S CERTAIN THRESHOLDS, IF IT'S A CERTAIN LOOKING FOR, THERE'S CERTAIN THRESHOLDS, IF IT'S A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF INCREASED DENSITY YOU THRESHOLDS, IF IT'S A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF INCREASED DENSITY YOU HAVE TO PROVIDE X PERCENT OF AMOUNT OF INCREASED DENSITY YOU HAVE TO PROVIDE X PERCENT OF AFFORDABLE UNITS OR A FEE IN LOU HAVE TO PROVIDE X PERCENT OF AFFORDABLE UNITS OR A FEE IN LOU LIEU OF AFFORDABLE UNITS. AFFORDABLE UNITS OR A FEE IN LOU LIEU OF AFFORDABLE UNITS. SO MOST OF THE CASES THERE IS A LIEU OF AFFORDABLE UNITS. SO MOST OF THE CASES THERE IS A SET PERCENTAGE BUT THERE'S A FEW SO MOST OF THE CASES THERE IS A SET PERCENTAGE BUT THERE'S A FEW WHERE THEY'RE NEGOTIATED IF THAT SET PERCENTAGE BUT THERE'S A FEW WHERE THEY'RE NEGOTIATED IF THAT MAKES SENSE. WHERE THEY'RE NEGOTIATED IF THAT MAKES SENSE. CITY COUNCIL SOMETIMES CHANGES MAKES SENSE. CITY COUNCIL SOMETIMES CHANGES THEM BASED ON THE PROJECT.
