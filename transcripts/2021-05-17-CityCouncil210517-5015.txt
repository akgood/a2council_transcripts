SO PLEASE PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE TIME. IN ORDER TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT, PLEASE ENTER THE NUMBER ON YOUR SCREEN, 877-853-5247. 877-853-5247. ONCE YOU'RE CONNECTED, PLEASE ENTER MEETING I.D.94212732148. 94212732148. ONCE YOU ARE CONNECTED OUR CLERK WILL IDENTIFY YOU WHEN IT IS YOUR TURN TO SPEAK. SHE WILL "YOU  IDENTIFY YOU BY E LAST THREE DIGITS OF YOUR TELEPHONE NUMBER. OUR CLERK WILL NOTIFY YOU WHEN 30 SECONDS ARE REMAINING AND YOUR TIME HAS EXPIRED. WHEN YOUR TIME HAS EXPIRED, PLEASE CONCLUDE YOUR REMARKS AND CEDE THE FLOOR. OUR FIRST SPEAKER TODAY IS WILLIAM HAMPTON.
00:08:34.655: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING IN 402, MR. HAMPTON, YOU CAN UNMUTE YOURSELF.
00:08:42.596: >> CAN YOU HEAR ME?
00:08:44.464: >> Mayor Taylor: YES, WE CAN.
00:08:46.233: >> HELLO, EVERYBODY. HELLO, EVERYBODY. MY NAME IS WILLIAM HAMPTON AND I'M HERE REPRESENTING YOUR NAACP ANN ARBOR. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF DC-6. YOUR APPROVAL WOULD CREATE JUNETEENTH AS A CITY OF ANN ARBOR HOLIDAY. I STILL REMEMBER THE DIFFICULTY OF GETTING MLK APPROVED AS A NATIONAL HOLIDAY HERE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THE MLK DAY DESIGNATION DID NOT SEEM TO GAIN MUCH MOMENTUM UNTIL AFTER STEVIE WONDER'S HAPPY BIRTHDAY SONG IN HONOR OF MLK. RIGHT NOW, MLD REMAINS AS THE ONLY HOLIDAY IN AMERICA SPECIFICALLY SET ASIDE IN HONOR OF THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS. AFRICAN AMERICANS. JUNETEENTH REPRESENTS THE DAY OF EMANCIPATION FOR ENSLAVED AFRICAN AMERICANS AFTER 246 YEARS INVOLUNTARY SERVITUDE. IN MY JUDGMENT, TOTAL FREEDOM REMAINS A WORK IN PROGRESS, EVEN TODAY. IN FACT, ON THIS VERY DAY, MAY 17th, 67 YEARS AGO, OUR UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT RENDERED ITS DECISION IN THE BROWN vs. BOARD OF EDUCATION, TOPEKA, KANSAS, 1954. THAT OVERCALLED THE SEPARATE BUT EQUAL MANDATE OF MORE THAN A HALF CENTURY BEFORE THAT. AND MADE PUBLIC SCHOOLS OPEN FOR ALL OF US. IT WAS A SEGUE TO THEIVIL GH MOVEMENT AND AEGEDLY R MO EQU RHTS F PEOPLE WHO LOO LE MEN T AAS OF EMPLOYMENT, HOUSING, PUBLIC ACCOMMODATIONS, AND ECONOMIC SUSTAINABILITY. THIS ONGOING BATTLE FOR EQUALITY CONTINUES. IT IS NOW BEEN ALMOST 1456 YEAR- 156 YEARS SINCE THE JUNETEENTH. THIS WILL TAKE UNTIL 2111, 90 YEARS FROM RIGHT NOW FOR US TO BE OUT OF SLAVERY, FOR AS LONG AS WE WERE IN THIS UNFORTUNATE SITUATION. HOPEFULLY THAT'S SOMETHING FOR EACH OF US TO THINK ABOUT. THANKS TO ALL THE CITY COUNCILMEMBERS WHO HAVE BEEN PART OF THE NAACP. THE NAACP DOORS REMAIN HOP TO EVERYBODY BECAUSE WE STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT COLLABORATION IS BETTER THAN COMPETITION FOR THE SAKE OF RIGHT. WE ARE ALL IN THIS WORLD TOGETHER AND I TRUST THAT THE VOTE ON DC-6 WILL BE UNANIMOUS. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
00:11:26.760: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS MICHELLE HUGHES.
00:11:36.837: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING IN 677.
00:11:42.209: >> HI, THIS IS MICHELLE HUGHES. I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT -- HI. CAN YOU HEAR ME?
00:11:48.782: >> Mayor Taylor: YES, WE CAN. THANK YOU.
00:11:52.285: >> OKAY. I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE BUDGET AMENDMENTS. I WANT TO START WITH MY FAVORITE ONE WHICH IS AMENDMENT NUMBER 6, THAT'S THE AMENDMENT TO HIRE D.E.I. STAFF FOR DIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION. I THINK THAT DIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION SHOULD BE NUMBER ONE OF THE CITY. THE COUNTY HAS A RACIAL EQUITY OFFICER. THE CITY OF JACKSON HAS A RACIAL EQUITY OFFICER. I THINK THAT WE NEED TO BE CONSIDERING RACIAL EQUITY IN EVERYTHING WE DO, AND WE NEED SOMEBODY BOTTOM LINING THAT ON THE STAFF. SO THAT WHEN WE MAKE OUR DECISIONS, AND WHEN WE IMPLEMENT OUR DECISIONS, THEY ARE ALL MADE WITH THE -- WITH THE DIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION IN MIND. IT'S A PARTICULAR SKILL AND IT'S NOT SUFFICIENT TO JUST HAVE EVERYBODY -- TO HAVE EVERYBODY THINK ABOUT IT BECAUSE LIKE WE HIRE A TRAFFIC ENGINEER TO BE A TRAFFIC ENGINEER. WE DON'T HIRE THEM TO BE A RACIAL EQUITY SPECIALIST. WE NEED SOMEONE WHO IS A RACIAL EQUITY SPECIALIST. SO PLEASE VOTE YES ON THAT. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO TALK ABOUT AMENDMENTS 8 AND 10, WHICH WOULD REORIENT OUR BUDGET TOWARDS THE COMPREHENSIVE TRANSPORTATION PLAN. IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT A BUDGET WOULD BE PRESENTED THAT DIDN'T TAKE THE COMPREHENSIVE TRANSPORTATION PLAN RECOMMENDATIONS INTO EFFECT. AND THE -- YOU KNOW, AMENDMENT 8 TALKS ABOUT STREETLIGHTS. APPARENTLY THE BUDGET A LOT TOWARDS STREETLIGHTS AND THE STREETLIGHTS ARE IMPORTANT, BUT THE COMPREHENSIVE TRANSPORTATION PLAN PUT -- AS DESIGNED WITH A LOT OF FACTORS IN M MIND AND A T OF THINGS IN MIND AND PUTS STREETLIGHTS AT THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL, AND THERE'S OTHER THINGS WE NEED TO DO FOR SAFETY THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AND SHOULD BE DONE. SO PLEASE PASS AMENDMENTED 8 AND 10. ALSO PLEASE PASS ON THE TOPIC OF SAFETY ON THE STREETS, PLEASE PASS AMENDMENT NUMBER TWO, HEALTHY STREETS. I'M SORRY THAT WE HAVE TO WAIT A COUPLE OF EXTRA MONTHS, JUST LIKE WE DID LAST YEAR TO PASS THIS THING. BUT IT WILL BE BETTER IF IT'S DONE THAN IF IT'S NOT DONE. SO PLEASE KEEP US SAFE BY PASSING AMENDMENT NUMBER TWO FOR HEALTHY STREETS. PLEASE DON'T PASS AMENDMENT NUMBER FOUR. THAT'S -- AMENDMENT NUMBER FOUR WOULD NOT HIRE ADDITIONAL STAFF FOR A2ZERO FOR THE SUSTAINABILITY OFFICE. WE NEED THOSE STAFF. WE NEED TO COMMIT TO THAT PLEDGE. SO THAT'S -- THAT'S ALL I CAN FIT IN MY THREE MINUTES. THANKS VERY MUCH. GOOD LUCK!
00:14:45.458: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS BLAINE COLEMAN.
00:14:50.296: >> Clerk Beaudry: MR. COLEMAN.
00:14:50.930: >> THIS IS BLAINE COLEMAN. TONIGHT BELONGS TO THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE. HUNDREDS OF WHOM HAVE JUST BEEN KILLED BY ISRAELI BOMBERS AND BY YOUR TAX DOLLARS AND TONIGHT THOUSANDS OF PALESTINIANS HAVE BEEN BLOWN OUT OF THEIR HOMES. OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS, PALESTINIANS HAVE SEEN THEIR APARTMENT BU BUILDS BLOWN DOWN O THE GROUND BY THE ISRAELI MILITARY, AND TONIGHT WE JOIN HANDS WITH 2 MILLION PALESTINIAN SOULS WHO ARE STILL ALIVE IN THE GAZA STRIP. AND WE WANT TO KEEP THEM ALIVE. WE DEFINITELY DON'T WANT MILITARY AID TO ISRAEL. WE WANT TO KEEP THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE ALIVE. AND THOSE PALESTINIANS WHO COULD SAY IT SO MUCH BETTER THAN ME SO MANY OF THEM HAVE BEEN KILLED BY ISRAEL. A MADGE TEARIAL WRITER, THE 2,000 PALESTINIANS WHO WERE BOMBED AND SHOT TO DEATH BY ISRAEL IN 2014. WE JOIN HANDS WITH ALL OF THOSE PALESTINIANS, WITH THE WHOLE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE TONIGHT. TONIGHT IS THEIR NIGHT. THEY COULD SAY IT SO MUCH BETTER THAN ME. AND I SAY WE ARE AGAINST MILITARY AID TO ISRAEL. I THINK THAT EVERY PERSON WITH AN OUNCE OF HUMANITY IN THE ROOM, IN THE CITY, IN THE WORLD TONIGHT HAS TO BE AT THE VERY LEAST AGAINST MILITARY AID TO ISRAEL. THINK OF THE HUNDREDS OF PALESTINIANS WHO YOU HAVE JUST KILLED WITH YOUR TAX MONEY. YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THAT ANYMORE. YOU AND I HAVE THE RIGHT TO SAY NO. NO, WE DON'T WANT OUR TAX MONEY GOING TO THE ISRAELI MILITARY. YOU WILL HEAR TONIGHT FROM PEOPLE WHO THINK IT'S DIVISIVE. YES, THERE'S A DIVISION OF OPINION. SOME PEOPLE WANT THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE TO LIVE, AND MANY PEOPLE DON'T. I WANT THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE TO LIVE. AND TONIGHT IS THEIR NIGHT.
00:17:24.050: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
00:17:25.118: >> TONIGHT IN THIS QUIET PLACE WE JOIN HANDS WITH THE WHOLE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING THEIR BEST, 2MILLION MEN, WOMEN AND CHILDREN, DOING THEIR BEST TO CARRY THE BURDEN OF FREEDOM FOR THE WHOLE WORLD. WITHOUT POWER, WITHOUT LIGHT, WITHOUT FOOD AND WATER. AND THEY WILL PREVAIL AND THEY WILL SUR VIV SURVIVE AND WE OUGO LEND A HAND.
00:17:58.551: >> Clerk Beaudry: TIME.
00:18:00.019: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS MOZHGAN SAVABIEASFAHANI.
00:18:11.364: >> HELLO? HELLO?
00:18:19.439: >> Clerk Beaudry: YES, GO AHEAD, CALLER.
00:18:21.341: >> HELLO. THIS IS DR. MOZHGAN SAVABIEASFAHANI. I AM A LONG TIME DEFENDER OF THE PALESTINIAN HUMAN RIGHTS. I DON'T REMEMBER ANY TIME THAT I WASN'T IN MY LIFE. AND I WAS MUCH MORE INTIMATELY INVOLVED WITH PALESTINIAN COMMUNITY WHEN I STAYED IN WEST BANK AND TAUGHT PALESTINIAN CHILDREN AND HAD THE HONOR TO LEARN FIRST HAND TO LEARN ABOUT THEIR COURAGE AND HUMANITY AND FORGIVENESS. BELIEVE IT OR NOT PERFECT PALESTINIANS FORGIVE THE CRIMES OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AGAINST THEM AND THEY JUST WANT TO BE ABLE TO LIVE. UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT AND ISRAELI GOVERNMENT HAVE THEIR LANDS BLOODY. THEY ARE CRIMINALS WHEN IT COMES TO PALESTINE. OF COURSE MANY OTHER PLACES BUT TONIGHT WE TALK ABOUT PALESTINE. ISRAEL IS AN APARTHEID STATE. AND THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN HELPING ISRAEL TO DESTROY A PEOPLE ANY OF YOU WHO HAVE RESERVATIONS ABOUT SIT CUTTING F IMILITARY AID, LOOK TO SEE WHAT TYPE OF BEAST LIVES THERE. GET RID OF THAT BEAST. YOU CAN BECOME HUMAN AGAIN. ANY ONE OF YOU WHO WANTS TO DISCUSS MORE TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT PALESTINIAN MISERY TO SEE IF THEY ACTUALLY DESERVE TO BE TREATED LIKE HUMAN BEINGS. I HOPE YOU HAD A VERY GOOD EDUCATION AT THE SOFT OF THOUSANDS DEAD, MANY HUNDREDS DYING MORE RECENTLY, MANY BEINGS SENT TO HOSPITAL THAT ARE ALREADY CRIPPLED AND CANNOT TAKE CARE OF HOME:  I HOPE HAVE YOU LEARNED YOUR LESSON AND YOU CAN SAFELY AND EASILY SAY THE VERY LEAST WE CAN ASK FOR IS A TOP MILITARY AID TO ISRAEL. I HOPE YOU HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF HUMANITY STILL LEFT IN YOUR BODY TO LOOK AT THE CHILDREN WHO ARE BEING DRAGGED OUT OF THE RUBBLE, SHOCKED SO THAT THEY ARE BASICALLY LEFT.
00:20:59.265: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
00:21:00.233: >> I HOPE YOU CAN LOOK AT THEM AND SAY, YES, AT THE VERY LEFT, I WILL SAY LET'S NOT GIVE ISRAEL ANY MORE ARMS. I AM WAITING TO HEAR YOU WITH MORE HEART AND HUMANITY TO STAND UP AND PROPOSE THAT WE ARE AGAINST MILITARY AID TO ISRAEL. THAT IS THE VERY, VERY LEAST WE CAN DO FOR THE COURAGEOUS, HEROIC RESISTANT PEOPLE OF PALESTINE. CLERK TIME.
00:21:30.430: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS DECKY ALEXANDER.
00:21:47.079: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING IN 164. MS. LEX, GO AHEAD.
00:21:50.817: >> GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE. HERE'S WHAT I'M NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT. ISRAEL AND PALESTINE, ARABS AND JEWS, OR YEARS OF LOCAL APATHIC ACTIVISM BY A VOCAL FEW, HOURS OF WASTED POSSIBILITY WHICH IF ITS MESSENGERS WERE GOOD PEOPLE COULD HAVE ON USED TO CULTIVATE INTERFAITH RELATIONS WHICH MAY NOT SOLVE A GEOPOLITICAL CRISIS, I KNOW, BUT COULD BECOME AN OPENING, A TRIB TRIBUTARY. OR OUR JEWISH COMMUNITY HAVE BEEN SUGGESTED TO SEVERAL GENERATIONS IN THIS TOWN, 17 YEARS OF STREET CORNER SYNAGOGUE SUBJECT TO HATE, OR AS ONE FORMER CITY COUNCILMEMBER SHARED IN REFERENCE TO THE WEEKLY SYNAGOGUE HATE SIGNS, GROWING UP PROTESTEEA IOU BE I'MOTOING TO TALK ABOUT THAT. I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT YOU. YOU ARE TO NOT TO ELEVATE THE FLOODGATE OF HATE TOWARDS YOUR CITIZENS. PUTTING FORTH A GLOBAL DRIVEN RESOLUTION AS MS. GRISWOLD DID HARDLESS OF ITS SOCIAL RELEVANCE OR URGENCY IS JUST NOT YOUR JOB. IT'S NOT EVEN KIND OF YOUR JOB. UNLESS TABLING, IT'S NOT TO BE A WHITE SAVIOR, OR A OF A GEOPOLITICAL CRISIS IS A GOOD THING AND HERE IS THE TRUTH. THE CITY COUNCIL CANNOT REGULATE THE ANTI-JEWISH RHETORIC OR TO ACTUAL SPACE DAY AND DAY, WEEK AFTER WEEK, AND MORE THAN OFTEN ARE NOT HALF TOLERATED BUT YOU DO NOT HAVE TO ENCOURAGE IT. YOU DO NOT NOT NEED TO PUT FORTH RESOLUTION FOR RACISTS AND ANTI-SEMITES AND BULLIES. YOU DON'T NEED TO CREATE THE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE GROUPS YOU HAVE L LITTLE OR NO AFFILIATION. INSTEAD THOSE WHO ARE OF THOSE COMMUNITIES NAVIGATE THE STICKINESS OF OUR IDENTITIES. YOU MAY HAVE TO LISTEN WEEKLY TO THE BARRAGE OF HATE-FILLED SPEECH BUT YOU DON'T NEED TO NURTURE IT BECAUSE THEN YOU ARE, INDEED COMPLICIT, A COPILOT IN TODAY'S ONGOING HATE WARS. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME.
00:24:32.278: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
00:24:33.045: >> I'M FINISHED.
00:24:35.348: >> Mayor Taylor: MY APOLOGIES. THE NEXT SPEAKER IS EMILIA CALLAN.
00:24:46.759: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING IN 825, IF YOU PRESS STAR SIX, YOU CAN UNMUTE YOUR PHONE.
00:24:54.900: >> I HAD THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK. MY NAME IS EMILIA CALLAN. I'M 20 YEARS OLD. I LIVE IN THE SECOND WARD AND NOW ATTEND M.S.U. AND STUDYING ZOOLOGY. AS AN ANIMAL LOVER I HAVE BEEN VERY TROUBLED BY THE EASE AT WHICH ANN ARBOR CHOOSES TO KILL THE WILDLIFE THAT SHARES OUR COMMUNITY. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT GO TO THE SERVICE THAT IS ADDRESSES REAL ISSUES. AS SOMEONE WHO CARES DEEPLY ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE AND AS SOMEONE WHO STUDIES ECOSYSTEMS I WANT TO STRESS THAT OUR ECOSYSTEMS ARE LIVE THINGS, CONTINUOUSLY CHANGING AND EXTREMELY COMPLEX. AND IMPORTANTLY, OUR ECOSYSTEMS AND THE AMAZING WILDLIFE WITHIN THEM CHANGE RAPIDLY, DUE TO HUMAN INTERFERENCE. TO PINPOINT ONE SPECIES, ONE IN NORTH AMERICA FOR MILLIONS OF YEARS AND REMOVE THEM BASED ON OUR OWN ALTERATIONS OF THE LAND WE SHARE DOESN'T SEEM RATIONAL TO ME. I UNDERSTAND SOME PEOPLE SEE DEER AS A NUISANCE. AND SOME FEEL THE SAME WAY FOR SKUNKS, COYOTES AND GEESE BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT NATURE AND WILDLIFE ARE A VITAL PART OF THIS CITY AND THAT'S LOVED AND ENJOYED BY MANY. WE ARE SO FORTUNATE TO LIVE IN A BEAUTIFUL CITY WITH SO MUCH NATURAL BEAUTY BUT TO HAVE AND ENJOY NATURE AROUND US, RESPECTING THE WILDLIFE THAT COMES WITH IT. LET US WORK AGAINST THE HATE AND THE VIOLENCE AND INSTEAD SPREAD POSITIVE MESSAGES THAT WE ALL NEED RIGHT NOW, ESPECIALLY FOR YOUNG PEOPLE. URBAN W WILDLIFE ARE A PART OF U ARE COMMUNITY. LET ANN ARBOR BE AN EXAMPLE OF LOVING AND THOUGHTFUL SOLUTIONS TO COMMUNITY CHALLENGES. THANK YOU SO MUCH. OUR
00:26:34.967: >> Mayor Taylor: OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS ELIZABETH HUNTER.
00:26:39.071: >> Clerk Beaudry: MS. HUNTER, 877, GO AHEAD.
00:26:48.080: >> ARE YOU ABLE TO HEAR ME?
00:26:50.249: >> Mayor Taylor: YES, WE CAN.
00:26:56.322: >> MAYOR TAKER, I SEE THAT YOU AND COUNCILMEMBERS HAYNER AND RAMLAWI ALL HAVE SIMILAR DEER CULL RESOLUTIONS TONIGHT AND I CAN ONLY ASK DO YOU NOT SPEAK TO THEM? WHAT ABOUT LEADING MEETINGS WHERE TIME IS EFFICIENT. THIS IS ONLY ONE OF MANY EXAMPLES WHERE YOU COULD HAVE BROUGHT PEOPLE TOGETHER BUT DID NOT. UNFORTUNATELY FOR ANN ARBOR, YOU ARE A DIVISIVE LEVER AND YOU DENY ALTERNATIVE RACES A SEAT AT THE TABLE. THIS IS THE OPPOSITE OF DIVERSITY. YOU DISMISS POINTS OF VIEW THAT DO NOT SUIT YOUR INTERESTS. AND YOU EVEN WENT FARTHER AWAY FROM GOOD GOVERNANCE WHEN YOU LED A MOB AGAINST HAYNER. A MOB THAT WORKS UP EMOTION, UNCONSTRAINED BY PROCESS, AND IT'S ACTUALLY REALLY MUCH BETTER THAN HAYNER, THOUGH. IT'S WHAT THREATENED ANYONE WHO IS CONSIDERED A MINORITY AND WHEN THE ELECTED BODY NORMALIZES MOB BEHAVIOR, IT HURTS MINORITIES WORST OF ALL, SINCE IT IS PROCESSED AND RULES THAT PROTECT THEM. AND EVERYONE ELSE FOR THAT MATTER. WHAT YOU AND YOUR COUNCIL RECRUITS DID WAS MOB RULE. BOTH LAWYERS PRESENT THEY MEETING WHERE C.N. HAYNER WAS CENSORED AND BOTH BEING MEMBERS OF THE BAR WERE THERE FOR THE RULES, NOT TO BE ENABLERS OF MOB RULE. SADLY, WHAT IS GOING ON HERE IS WE ARE ALL WATCHING THE SLOW COLLAPSE OF CIVIL SOCIETY IN ANN ARBOR. [ NO AUDIO ]
00:29:14.226: >> Mayor Taylor: MS. BEAUDRY, DID THE SPEAKER HANG UP OR IS THERE A TECHNICAL PROBLEM?
00:29:17.296: >> Clerk Beaudry: I THINK WE LOST THE SPEAKER. I DON'T KNOW WHETHER SHE HUNG UP BUT I NO LONGER SEE HER ON THE LINE.
00:29:44.823: >> Mayor Taylor: I ASSUME YOU HAVE A CLOCK AS FAR AS HOW MUCH WAS REMAINING?
00:29:49.862: >> Clerk Beaudry: YES.
00:29:50.362: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. I GUESS WITH COUNCIL'S ACQUIESCENCE AND IN THE SPEAKER CALLS BACK AND INDICATES THAT SHE WAS SHORTED DUE TO TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES, WE WILL REOPEN PUBLIC COMMENT. IS THAT REASONABLE TO EVERYONE? AND AS TO THE SPEAKER THANK YOU. ARE THERE COMMUNICATIONS FROM COUNCIL? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
00:30:24.363: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I WILL TRY NOT TO BE LONG. I WASN'T REALLY PREPARED TO SPEAK ON THIS TONIGHT. I DON'T HAVE ANY PREPARED STATEMENTS BUT I HAVE BEEN TROUBLED AND I KNOW ALL OF MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD ARE TROUBLED WHAT IS OCCURRING IN GAZA AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES IS NOTHING SHORT OF A WAR CRIME. THE ONLY PARTY YET -- ONE OF THE ONLY PARTIES -- THERE'S A FEW PARTIES THAT ARE JOUST LIARS TO THAT -- OUTLIERS TO THAT AND THAT IS THE UNITED STATES. THE UNITED STATES FOR THREE TIMES IN ONE WEEK HAS BLOCKED THE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL FROM RELEASING AND ISSUING A CEASE-FIRE. A SIMPLE CEASE-FIRE STATEMENT. THE UNITED STATES HAS BLOCKED THE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL THREE TIMES. I HAVE BEEN UP HERE ON CITY COUNCIL FOR MANY YEARS NOW AND EVERY MEETING WE TALK ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS AND WE TALK ABOUT EQUITY, AND WE TALK ABOUT INCLUSION AND ALL OF THESE THINGS AND, IN FACT, TONIGHT, WE'RE GOING TO BE ADOPTING A HOLIDAY RISING SUCH A THING. AND IT WILL BE UNANIMOUSLY SUPPORTED. WHAT WE HAVE GOING ON THERE IS NOT A CONFLICT. YOU HAVE A NUCLEAR POWER WHO HAS COMPLETE CONTROL OVER ANOTHER POPULATION. WHO HAS NO WILL GO OVER THEIR BOARDERS NOT THE FOOD THAT COMES IN AND NOT THE WATER THAT THEY DRINK AND NOT THE ROADS THEY TRAVEL ON. NOTHING. SO IT'S NOT A CONFLICT AT THIS POINT. IT'S AN IMPERIAL COLONIALIST POWER THAT CONTINUES TO DO MORE DAMAGE AND DESTRUCTION AND I'M A PALESTINIAN. AND NOT OUT THERE PROTESTING AT THE SYNAGOGUE. I DON'T EVEN SUPPORT THAT. BUT I AM HURT AND I WAS HURT BY SOME OF THE COMMENTS MADE HERE TONIGHT ALREADY. THANK YOU.
00:32:56.181: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILWOMAN GRISWOLD. WA.>> Councilmember Griswold:  I WANTED TO GIVE AN UPDATE ON THE 1, 4, DIOXANE PLUME, OTHERWISE KNOWN AS THE GELMAN PLUME. IT'S OBVIOUSLY NOT ACCEPTABLE, BUT IT'S ONGOING CLEANUP. THE SECOND ONE IS AN ORDER FROM JUDGE CONNORS THAT'S IN THE PROCESS OF BEING FINALIZED NOW, THAT WOULD INCLUDE THE AGREED UPON SECTIONS OF THE FOURTH C.J., WHICH I CONSIDER SORT OF A MIDTERM SOLUTION, AND THE THIRD ONE IS THE EPA CLEANUP, WHICH I CONSIDER MORE OF A LONG-TERM SOLUTION, AND IF ANYONE WOULD LIKE INFORMATION ABOUT THE STATUS OF EPA PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT, THEY CAN SIMPLY SEARCH ON THE TERM EPA GELMAN AND IT WILL TAKE YOU TO AN EPA PAGE THAT HAS THE LATEST INFORMATION ABOUT THE GELMAN CLEANUP, AND THE ANALYSIS THAT'S GOING ON. THANK YOU.
00:34:11.690: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER SONG?
00:34:14.660: >> Councilmember Song: I WANT TO THANK COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI FOR BEING SO OPEN AND SHARING THAT. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ENCOURAGE FOLKS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE UNITED WAY'S EQUITY CHALLENGE. IT'S THE 21-DAY EQUITY CHALLENGE THAT THEY STARTED LAST YEAR. AND IS NOW BEING REPLICATED ACROSS THE STATE. SO I ASK FOLKS THAT AT THE CITY PARTICIPATE. IT KICKS OFF JUNETEENTH, JUNE 19th. YOU GET PROMPTS ENVIRONMENT MORNING ON READINGS, VIDEOS, PODCASTS AND UNDERSTANDING THE CHALLENGES THAT ARE HAPPENING WITHIN OUR COMMUNITY AND RHONDE. IT'S WWW.EWASHTENAWEQUITY.GOV.
00:35:14.152: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER DISCH.
00:35:15.887: >> Councilmember Disch: WE HAVE SEEN DISPLACEMENT AND DESECRATION OF AHOLY SITESND I'M RE TT A BROAD RANGE OF PEOPLE ACROSS THISITY, THI COUNITY  MAN FAITHS AND WEIG AND THE SORROW OF THESE EVENTS, AND I DIDN'T WANT TO GO ABOUT BUSINESS AS USUAL WITHOUT ACKNOWLEDGING THAT.
00:35:43.382: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RADINA.
00:35:45.017: >> Councilmember Radina: THANK YOU, MAYOR TAYLOR. I WANTED TO RECOGNIZE THAT TODAY, MAY 17th IS ALSO INTERNATIONAL DAY AGAINST HOMOPHOBIA, BIPHOBIA, INTERPHOBIA AND TRANSPHOBIA WHICH IS A DAY TO CELEBRATE THE LGBTQ+ COMMUNITY GLOBALLY BUT ALSO TO RAISE AWARENESS FOR THE WORK THAT STILL NEEDS TO BE DONE TO COMBAT DISCRIMINATION AND HATRED:  IT'S A DAY REALLY TO CELEBRATE LGBTQ PEOPLE, BUT TO PUSH BACK AGAINST SOME OF THE HATRED AND PAIN THAT IS STILL INFLICTED UPON THAT COMMUNITY. AND SO IN ORDER TO GIVE VOICE TO THE FACT THAT LGBTQ+ PEOPLE HERE IN OUR COMMUNITY AND AROUND THE WORLD DESERVE TO BE ABLE TO LIVE IN THEIR HOMES WITH DIGNITY, EQUALITY AND SAFE AND WELCOMING IN THEIR HOMES. I WANT TO SAY TO THE LGBTQ+ RESIDENTS HERE THAT YOU ARE WELCOME AND YOU ARE SEEN. SO THANK YOU.
00:36:55.587: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
00:36:56.488: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES THANK YOU. I WILL BE BRIEF. IT WAS INTERESTING TO HEAR SOME OF THESE CALLERS SPEAK TONIGHT AND IT'S TRUE SOME OF THESE MESSAGES WE HAVE HEARD BEFORE AND SOME WE HAVEN'T. I HAD NO PROBLEM DEDICATING MY MOMENT OF SILENCE TO THE FOLKS WHO ARE IN CONFLICT OVER THERE IN ISRAEL AND PALESTINE AND GAZA AND THE WEST BANK AND IT'S A REAL MESS OVER THERE AND IT HAS BEEN FOR QUITE SOMETIME. I MEAN MY ENTIRE LIFE AND, YOU KNOW, IT KIND OF CAME AND WHEN I WAS IN SCHOOL AND YOU KIND OF GET ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS. AND YOU GET ON WITH YOUR OWN LIFE. AND THEN I WANT TO SAY IT WAS IN 2003 WHEN RACHEL CORY WAS KILLED OVER THERE. IN 2004, OUR HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION ASKED CITY COUNCIL TO PUT FORWARD A RESOLUTION IN SUPPORT OF ENDING U.S. MILITARY AID FOR ISRAEL. AND IT WAS A PRETTY DECENT AND SIMPLE ASK -- IT'S LIKE WE DO WITH POLICY AGENDA AND OTHER THINGS WHERE THEY URGE THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO STOP MILITARY AID TO ISRAEL. I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM SAYING THAT PERSONALLY, BUT OBVIOUSLY I DON'T SPEAK FOR THIS BODY. I'M AGAINST MILITARY AID TO ISRAEL AND I THINK IT WOULD BE NICE IF THIS BODY WENT ON THE RECORD AS SAYING SOMETHING ABOUT THIS. LITTLE THINGS AND LITTLE PLACES ADD UP TO M BIG CHANGES. WE HAVE 30 D DEMOCRATS IN THE SENATE WHO HAVE ASKED FOR THIS TO STOP. WE HAVE THE CHAIR OF THE SENATE BUDGET BERNIE SANDERS HAS ASKED FOR THIS TO STOP. HOW CAN WE STAY SILENT ANY LONGER. I THINK THIS IS A CASE WHERE SILENCE EQUALS COMPLICITY. I THINK WE ARE COMPLICIT IF WE DON'T SAY SOMETHING. AND THE NOTION THAT IT'S NOT UP TO A WHITE MAN TO SAY SOMETHING IS RIDICULOUS, BECAUSE IF IMENDOWED WITH THIS WHITE PRIVILEGE THEN I NEED TO VOICE THAT PRIVILEGE. AND MAKE MY FEELINGS KNOWN AND CALL FOR THE RIGHT THINGS AND CALL FOR THE RIGHT ACTION.
00:39:07.052: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMAN.
00:39:07.652: >> Councilmember Hayner: IMDISMAYED TO SPEAK TOAL HUMAN RIGHTS AND SPEAK TO WHAT IS RIGHT IN THIS WORLD AND I'M DISAPPOINTED --
00:39:15.827: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER.
00:39:16.495: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I'M DISAPPOINTED. I'M DISAPPOINTED.
00:39:20.065: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS.
00:39:22.000: >> Councilmember Briggs: REAL BRIEFLY, I WANTED TO DRAW ANYBODY WHO IS WATCHING, THEIR ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT ON MAY 20th, NOMINATIONS FOR A2ZERO CHAMPIONS ARE -- THAT'S THE DEADLINE FOR NOMINATING SOMEBODY OR AN ORGANIZATION. SO IF YOU KNOW ANYBODY WHO HAS GONE OUT OF THEIR WAY ON SUSTAINABILITY OR EQUITY OR CLIMATE CHANGE, FILL OUT THE APPLICATION. AND THERE IS A LINK TO IN OUR AGENDA. AND I LOOK IN ORDER TO SEEING WHO ALL THE NOMINEES ARE AND THANKS.
00:39:57.769: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER COMMUNICATION FROM COUNCIL? COUNCILMEMBER GRAND?
00:40:06.511: >> Councilmember Grand: I APPRECIATE WHAT SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID THIS EVENING WHICH IS REFLECTIVE OF THE PAIN A LOT OF US FEEL, AND I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE AN IMPORTANT POINT THAT WAS BROUGHT UP ABOUT THE LOCAL CONTEXT OF WHO HAS BEEN PUSHING FOR THIS CONVERSATION. BECAUSE IT'S -- BECAUSE IT'S BEEN UNNOT NATALIE SOMETHING THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE OF ALL FAITHS THAT HAVE VARIED OPINIONS ABOUT WHAT THEY SEE AND FEEL PAIN ACROSS THE BOARD. AND THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT IN OUR PARTICULAR LOCAL CONTEXT, THAT THOSE OF US IN THE JEWISH COMMUNITY HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO PERSISTENT ANTISEMITISM FROM THOSE COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO CALLED IN THIS EVENING. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S WIDE DIVERSITY OF OPINION, BOTH HERE AND ABROAD, THAT THERE'S ACTUALLY A LOT MORE PEOPLE WHO -- WHO DON'T WANT CONFLICT, WHO REALLY DO HOPE FOR PEACE AND ARE DISTRAUGHT ABOUT WHAT THEY HAVE SEEN, BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO CALL OUT HATE IN OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY WHEN WE SEE IT. AND I WAS TRYING TO SIT SILENTLY BUT CAN'T BECAUSE THERE ARE PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY WHO HAVE COME AFTER THOSE IN LINE, AND THAT'S -- AND I JUST WEEK AFTER WEEK, WE WERE NOT DEALING WITH LOTS OF HARM. I THINK THE MAYOR HAS SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT SOME OTHER HARM THAT WAS CAUSED THIS WEEK TO MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY AND I JUST HOPE THAT WE CAN STOP.
00:42:13.705: >> Mayor Taylor: OTHER COMMUNICATION FROM COUNCIL? I WOULD LIKE TO REQUEST CONFIREMARKS OF THE FOLLOWING APPOINTMENTS.

I JUST WANTED TO -- JUST, YOU KNOW THIS IS A MEETING WHERE WE GET TO APPOINT A LOT OF FOLKS TO -- WHO HAVE SERVED FOR A LONG TIME OR WHO ARE STEPPING UP FOR THE FIRST TIME TO SERVE OUR COMMUNITY, AND ONE OF THE BEST PARTS OF BEING ON COUNCIL IS GETTING TO WORK WITH SO MANY WONDERFUL VOLUNTEERS FROM OUR COMMUNITY WHO DO THIS. SO I WANT TO THANK THEM FOR THEIR SERVICE.
00:44:55.233: >> Clerk Beaudry: MAYOR? I JUST WANTED TO -- MAYOR, I WANT TO CONFIRM THAT YOU WERE FINISHED READING THE LIST FOR THE ZONING BOARD.

00:45:43.448: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD?
00:45:45.316: >> Councilmember Griswold: CONSISTENT WITH OUR EQUITY GOALS, I WOULD LIKE TO RECOMMEND THAT WE PROVIDE SOME DEMOGRAPHICS, SORT OF A RUNNING TOTAL WHENEVER WE APPOINT ADDITIONAL PEOPLE TO BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS, BECAUSE THERE SEEMS TO BE A LOT OF MYSTERY THERE AND I KNOW WE HAVE A GOAL BUT ONE OF THE SAYINGS IN EDUCATION IS WHAT GETS MEASURED GETS DONE. THANK YOU. FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? ALL OPPOSED? THEY ARE APPROVED. I WOULD LIKE TO RECOMMEND THE FOLLOWING NOMINATION, IN A ONE-STEM PROCESS TO THE HISTORIC DISTRICT COMMISSION, JENNIFER ROSS. MS. ROSS IS AN ARCHITECTURAL HISTORIAN WHO HAS SERVED ON THE COMMISSION PREVIOUSLY. I BELIEVE THE RAPIDITY OF THE APPOINTMENT WAS REQUESTED BY STAFF. MAY I HAVE A MOTION, PLEASE. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER DISCH. DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
00:47:02.427: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: QUESTION?
00:47:12.070: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I'M SORRY THAT WAS INADVERTENT.
00:47:14.672: >> Mayor Taylor: ALL IN FAVOR? IT IS APPROVED, ALL IN FAVOR, AND SATISFYING THE EIGHT VOTE REQUIREMENT. I WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE FOR -- MS. BEAUDRY, MC-3 IS THE NEXT MEETING? IS THAT FOR LATER IN THIS MEETING?
00:47:39.330: >> Clerk Beaudry: MY UNDERSTANDING IS THIS WAS BEING PRESENTED FOR APPROVAL AT A LATER DATE. THE SEVEN VOTE REQUIREMENT IS DUE TO HER NOT BEING A CITY RESIDENT.
00:47:47.872: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
00:47:49.073: >> Clerk Beaudry: BUT THE NORMAL TWO-STEP PROCESS.
00:47:51.743: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I WOULD LIKE TO RECOMMEND THE FOLLOWING NOMINATION FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AT OUR NEXT MEETING, KRISTENCHWEIGHOER THE HOUSI BOARD OF APPEALS. FINALLY, AND BRIEFLY, AS COUNCILMEMBER GRAND INDICATED, IT'S MIQUELL AND MY HOPE THAT WE AS A COUNCIL -- IT'S MY GOAL AND MY HOPE THAT WE AS A COUNCIL CAN MOVE FORWARD AND WORK ON POLICY MATTERS AND THAT WE NOT SPEND A GREAT DEAL OF TIME HAVING CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT EACH OF US STAY IN OUR VARIOUS -- IN OUR VARIOUS -- IN OUR VARIOUS CHANNELS. HOWEVER, IT'S MORE THAN FOR ME TO NOTE AND INDICATE, THAT YOU KNOW, STILL REFLECTING ON HOW EXACTLY TO PROCEED BUT ONE OF OUR COU COUNCILMEMBERS, COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, IT IS REPORTED IN THE NEWSPAPER THAT THE COUNCILMEMBER USED THE "N" WORD IN ITS FULLEST DURING THE COURSE OF AN INTERVIEW. IT WAS NOT SAID IN HANGER BUT SAID AS CONTEXTUAL ANALYSIS BUT NEVERTHELESS, THE WORD WAS SAID. THE VOICING OF THIS WORD IS ENTIRELY UNACCEPTABLE. IT DOES DEEP AND PERSONAL APARTMENT AND DISTANCES COMMUNITY MEMBERS FROM THEIR GOVERNMENT. THE "N" WORD IS AN UNSPEAKABLE OBSCENITY. IT IS USED FOR CENTURIES TO DEMEAN AND DEHUMANIZE, TO ENFORCE AND TO PERPETUATE. THE WORD IS TABOO AND IT'S NOT TO BE UTTERED. AND WE HAVE A -- I HAVE AN OPTION OF UNDERSTANDING THAT IT'S BEEN SPOKEN AND DO NOTHING OR UNDERSTAND IT'S BEEN SPOKEN AND DO SOMETHING AND I WILL CHOOSE TO DO SOMETHING. AND MY SUSPICION IS WE WILL TRY TO RUN THIS THROUGH THE ORDINARY PROCESS, BUT WE WILL --
00:50:05.309: >> Councilmember Hayner: POINT OF ORDER, MR. MAYOR. POINT OF ORDER.
00:50:10.681: >> Mayor Taylor: WHAT IS YOUR POINT OF THE ORDER?
00:50:12.250: >> Councilmember Hayner:  WE HAVE A PROCESS. THE PROCESS IS NOT -- IF YOU HAVE A PROCESS AND YOU WANT TO COMPLAIN ABOUT SOMETHING, FOLLOW THE PROCESS.
00:50:19.891: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER, I AM -- I AM EXPRESSING MY OPINION DURING COUNCIL COMMUNICATION -- PARDON ME, DURING MAYORAL COMMUNICATIONS. THERE'S NO POINT OF ORDER AND, IN FACT, YOU ARE RAISING A POINT OF ORDER IN THIS CONTEXT IS OBSTRUCTIVE.
00:50:37.275: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I HAVE A POINT OF PERSONAL PRIVILEGE TO DEFEND MYSELF FROM YOUR ACCUSATIONS.
00:50:42.680: >> Mayor Taylor: YOUR ACCUSATION IS FALSE. YOU CAN RAISE A POINT OF PERSONAL PRIVILEGE. I SUPPOSE I HAVE TO LOOK AT THAT. I WILL ENTERTAIN IT.
00:50:56.194: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I BELIEVE THE THINGS WE SAY AND THE WORDS WE SAY -- IF THIS BODY -- LET ME BACK UP HERE, IF THIS BODY SPENT AS MUCH TIME WORRYING ABOUT AND LISTENING TO THE THINGS I SAID AT THIS TABLE, WE WOULDN'T HAVE A STRUCTURAL DEFICIT. IF THIS BODY SPENT AS MUCH TIME LIST TO GO EACH OTHER, AS THEY DO PEERING OUTSIDE OF PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS AND WHAT IS SAID OUTSIDE THIS CHAMBER, WE WOULD BE BETTER OFF AND BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH POLICY. SOME OF US HAVE MADE IT AN OBSESSION TO LISTEN TO EVERY SINGLE WORD AND TRACK EVERY SINGLE WORD THAT PEOPLE HAVE SAID OUTSIDE OF THIS CHAMBER. AND DRAG IT IN HERE. THAT'S THE PROBLEM. THE PROBLEM ISN'T PROTECTED SPEECH OUTSIDE OF THIS CHAMBER. THE PROBLEM IS THE INCESSANT DRAGGING BACK HERE FOR PERSONAL EMBARRASSMENT, AND FOR WHO KNOWS WHAT REASONS. I REJECT YOUR ASSERTION THAT I DON'T HAVE A RIGHT TO SAY WHATEVER I WANT TO SAY OUTSIDE OF THIS CHAMBER.
00:52:00.591: >> Mayor Taylor: YOU WILL NEVER SAY WE YOU DON'T HAVE A RIGHT TO SAY WORDS, COUNCILMEMBER. I'M MERELY SAYING IT IMPROPER AND DEEPLY SO AND THAT IT'S UNACCEPTABLE AND I DO NOT ACCEPT IT. WE NOW COME TO THE CONSENT AGENDA. MAY I HAVE A MOTION TO APPROVE THE CONSENT AGENDA. MOVED BY GRAND AND SECONDED BY RADINA. DISCUSSION OF THE CONSENT AGENDA. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
00:52:41.532: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WOULD LIKE TO PULL OFF CA-5 FOR A COUPLE OF QUICK QUESTIONS.
00:52:48.439: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE CONSENT AGENDA. COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
00:52:53.077: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WANT TO MENTION THAT THERE ARE TWO F FEES -- ARE THE GELMAN LEL FEES ON HERE?
00:53:09.460: >> Mayor Taylor: YES, THEY ARE, CA-8.
00:53:14.298: >> Councilmember Griswold: OH, OKAY. I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT WE ARE CONTINUING TO SPEND MONEY TO FIGHT -- AND I WILL USE THE TERM FIGHT WITH GELMAN, A HUGE MULTIBILLION DOLLARS COMPANY IN ORDER TO GET CLEAN WATER FOR OUR COMMUNITY AND AT THIS POINT, WHILE I DON'T LIKE TO SPEND THE MONEY, IT'S MONEY THAT WE HAVE TO SPEND.
00:53:49.100: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE CONSENT AGENDA. ALL IN FAVOR OF THE CONSENT AGENDA WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CA-5. I'M SORRY, COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD, DID YOU HAVE SOMETHING ELSE?
00:54:00.745: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WAS VOTING, I'M SORRY.
00:54:03.447: >> Mayor Taylor: MY APOLOGIES. NO FURTHER DISCUSSION, ALL IN FAVOR OF THE CONSENT AGENDA, PLEASE SAY AYE. OPPOSED? CONSENT AGENDA IS APPROVED WITH 11 COUNCILMEMBERS PRESENT ALL APPROVED WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CA-5, ALL VOTING IN THE AFFIRMATIVE THURSDAY SATISFYING THE EIGHT VOTE REQUIREMENT WITH RESPECT TO CA-8, AND CA-9. CA-5, ARE E SOLUTION TO APPROVE A PAYMENT IN L LIEU OF TAXES PIT FOR LOCKWOOD OF ANN ARBOR. 2195 EAST ELLSWORTH. MOVED BY HAYNER AND SECONDED BY GRAND. DISCUSSION OF CA-5, MR. HAYNER.
00:54:41.318: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I SEE MR. DELACOURT IS HERE. I JUST HAD A QUICK QUESTION. IF I'M READING IT PROPERLY, AS LONG AS THOSE UNITS OUT THERE AT LOCKWOOD ARE IN THE SYSTEM, THEY ARE USING LOW-INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS AND PROVIDING THE BENEFIT THAT THE COMMUNITY IS ASKING F FOR, AFFORDABLE SENIOR HOUSING THAT THIS PILOT WILL STAY IN PLACE. I DIDN'T SEE AN EXPIRATION. THAT'S CONDITIONAL ON THE UNITS REPORTING OF THE PROPERTY -- THE PROPERTY OWNER REPORTING THAT THE UNITS CONTINUE TO HAVE THE SAME USE; IS THAT CORRECT?
00:55:14.318: >> WE ARE LUCKY TO HAVE MS. GILOTTI HERE.
00:55:22.259: >> Councilmember Hayner:  IF I MAY, BECAUSE WE HAVE CHANGED OUR RULES TO HAVE LIMITED TIME. SO MY SECOND PART OF THAT QUESTION IS HOW MUCH OF THE PROPERTY IS UNDER THE PILOT AND HOW MUCH IS PAYING ACTUAL PROPERTY TAXES TO THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR? AND DO WE KNOW WHAT THAT AMOUNT IS GOING TO BE MOVING FORWARD?
00:55:44.348: >> I WILL START WITH THE FIRST HALF OF THE QUESTION, GOOD EVENING. THE STATE OF MISSION LIMITS THE EXTENT OF THE A PILOT TO 50 YEARS. TO YOUR POINT, EVERY YEAR IT HAS TO BE CERTIFIED AS MEETING THE CONDITIONS TO GET THE PILOT WHICH IS SPECIFIC OWNERSHIP, HAVING STATE OR FEDERAL FUNDS IN THE PROJECT, AND IN THIS CASE SENIOR HOUSING AND ALSO AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO TRIGGER SO THERE ARE COMPONENTS THAT ARE CHECKED ANNUALLY AND IT HAS A MAXIMUM SORT OF DURATION OF 50 YEARS IF THOSE COMPONENTS ARE COMPLIED WITH EVERY SINGLE YEAR. SO THE -- I'M SORRY, THE ASSESSOR IS NOT ON TO ASK THE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PROPERTY. SO I WILL DO MY BEST TO NOTE THAT THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT SORT OF PILOTS THAT ARE APPLYING -- THAT ARE APPLYING FOR THE AFFORDABLE UNITS, AGAIN THAT MEET THE STATE CONDITIONS. IT WOULD BE $1 PER UNIT ON THOSE, AND FOR THE SENIOR UNITS THAT DON'T HAVE RENTER INCOME RESTRICTIONS BUT STILL COMPLY WITH THE MISTER REQUIREMENTSEN AT LOCAL -- AND THE LOCAL, THERE'S 4% SHELTER AND THAT WOULD APPLY TO THE ENTIRETY OF THE PROPERTY AS I UNDERSTAND IT. SO I DON'T KNOW. HOPEFULLY THAT GETS TO THE BULK OF YOUR QUESTIONS.
00:57:01.025: >> Councilmember Hayner: SURE. SO THIS PROPERTY, BECAUSE IT IS PROVIDING THESE BENEFITS IS ESSENTIALLY PAYING NO -- ESSENTIALLY NO -- OR VERY LITTLE -- MINIMAL.
00:57:11.235: >> Councilmember Hayner:  TO THEIR TYPICAL ASSESSMENT PROPERTY TAXES FOR 50 YEARS?
00:57:15.339: >> CORRECT.
00:57:15.673: >> Councilmember Hayner: OKAY. ALL RIGHT. I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE BECAUSE WE HAVE ANOTHER THING ON LATER, THE PILOT, KIND OF THE REVERSE OF THIS WHERE RIGHT NOW PEOPLE ARE EXEMPTED AUTOMATICALLY UNDER OLD STATE AND WE ARE ASKING THEM TO KIND OF PROVE THAT EXEMPTION, YOU KNOW, PROVE THE VALUE TO THE COMMUNITY TO CONTINUE WITH THAT EXEMPTION IN A VOLUNTARY WAY. AND SO I JUST -- WHEN I SAW PILOT, I WANTED TO ASK THAT QUESTION FOR CLARITY. THANK YOU.
00:57:41.265: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF CA-5. ALL IN FAVOR? OPPOSED? THE CA-5 IS APPROVED. WE NOW COME TO A SET OF PUBLIC HEARINGS. PUBLIC HEARINGS ARE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PUBLIC TO SPEAK TO COUNCIL AND THE COMMUNITY TO SPEAK ABOUT A SPECIFIC PUBLIC HEARING. YOU NEED NOT TO HAVE SIGNED UP IN ADVANCE, BUT YOUR SPEECH MUST RELATE TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THE PUBLIC HEARING, THAT IS TO SAY THE SPECIFIC ITEM ON THE AGENDA.

MOVED BY -- I'M SORRY. IS THERE ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING?
00:59:39.817: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING IN 948, DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT? CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING IN  948, YOU CAN PRESS STAR SIX TO UNMUTE YOURSELF.
00:59:50.961: >> HI, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
00:59:52.930: >> Mayor Taylor: YES, WE CAN.
00:59:53.897: >> ALL RIGHT. FANTASTIC. THANK Y'ALL FOR HAVING ME. OOPS, I GOT -- IS MY AUDIO COMING THROUGH HERE.
01:00:03.574: >> Mayor Taylor: IT WOULD BE HELPFUL IF YOU MUTE YOUR MEDIA DEVICE AND SPEAK ONLY INTO YOUR PHONE.
01:00:09.847: >> THERE WE GO. ALL RIGHT. FANTASTIC. MY NAME IS PHIL CLARK I'M THE GENERAL OF RAY'S RED HOTS IN DOWNTOWN ANN ARBOR. MYSELF AND THE OWNER RAY ARE THE ORIGINATORS OF THIS PROPOSAL FEE CAP AND COUNCIL PEOPLE GRAND AND RADINA AND MR. RAMLAWI, THE CITY ATTORNEY MR. RISER HAVE DONE A LOT OF GREAT WORK TO HELP US GET THIS FAR. SO WE JUST LIKE TO GIVE THEM A BITHANKS. STAURAS, PARCULARLY US LOCAL DOWNWN,HENOVID H, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN OVERNIGHT 80% OF OUR BUSINESS WAS BEING ROUTED THROUGH THESE THIRD-PARTY SERVICES AT COMMISSION RATES, AROUND 30%, IT'S A MAJOR BLOW AND BIG CHAINS LIKE McDONALD'S MULLETLY RIGHT NOW, THEY ARE GETTING THE SAME SERVICE WE ARE FOR HALF THE PRICE 15%. LOCAL BUSINESSES ARE BEING CHARGED DOUBLE OR MORE. IF YOU TRY TO PURSUE DIRECT NEGOTIATIONS WITH THESE COMPANIES, IF THEY BOTHER TO REPLY TO YOU AT ALL, THEY SIMPLY TELL YOU NO. IT WAS ACTUALLY USHER EATS WHO TOLD ME THE ONLY WAY TO REDUCE YOUR COMMISSION IS IF YOUR CITY ENACTS A FEE CAP. THAT'S WHERE THE IDEA CAME FROM AND WHY WE ARE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION. AT 629 EAST U, I DON'T HAVE ONE PARKING SPOT. I DON'T HAVE A LOADING ZONE. WE WOULD NEED 12 TO 24 DELIVERY DRIVERS. WE COULDN'T EVEN HAVE ONE PARKING SPOT. OUR VEHICLES GET $50 A POP TICKETS WHEN THEY ARE STAGED THERE IN ORDER FOR US TO EXECUTE BUSINESS. I SIMPLY HAVE NO CHOICE TO USE THESE SERVICES OR GO OUT OF BUSINESS. AND THESE SERVICES, THEY CHARGE THE CUSTOMER A DELIVERY FEE AND A SERVICE FEE. THEY TAKE THE 30% COMMISSION FROM THE RESTAURANT, AND THEY KEEP 100% OF THE TIP. THE RESTAURANT STAFF DON'T SEE A DIME. THEY PAY THEIR EMPLOYEES, 1099 INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS WITH LOW WAGES AND NO RIGHTS, MEANWHILE, THEY ARE POSTING REVENUE NUMBERS IN THE BILLIONS OR MORE. THEY ARE THE WINNERS OF THIS COVID-19 LOCKDOWN AS THEY HAVE MADE HUGE GAINS IN MARKET SHARE AND GROWN NUMBERS LIKE NEVER BEFORE OFF THE BACKS OF LOCAL RESTAURANTS LIKE US. WE ARE SHIPPING OFF -- JUST US, WE ARE SHIPPING OFF $10,000 TO $15,000 OR MORE PER MONTH DIRECTLY OUT OF MICHIGAN TO WALL STREET AND CALIFORNIA TORQUE DOORDASH, UBER HEATS AND GRUBHUB. THAT'S JUST US. THINK ABOUT THE MONEY THAT'S LEAVING OUR LOCAL ECONOMY BECAUSE OF THESE SERVICES. WE PAY OUR EMPLOYEE A LIVING WAGE, OUR HOURLY STAFF, $13 TO $15 AN HOUR. WE PROVIDE INSURANCE AND COMPANY VEHICLE FOR TRANSPORT AND OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY BENEFITS WHEN LOCAL RESTAURANTS LIKE US ARE ABLE TO KEEP A FAIR PERCENTAGE OF OUR OWN HARD-EARNED MONEY. THERE'S A LOT MORE I WANT TO SAY. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR HEARING ME OUT AND HAVING THIS CONVERSATION HERE TONIGHT.
01:03:06.556: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
01:03:12.529: >> Clerk Beaudry: MAYOR, I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER CALLERS WITH THEIR HANDS UP FOR THIS ITEM.
01:03:17.601: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING? SEEING NO ONE THIS PUBLIC HEARING IS CLOSED. PUBLIC HEARING NUMBER TWO, RESOLUTION TO APPROVE THE 2065, ANNEXATIONS, 1.5 ACRES, 2065, 2099 SOUTH MAIN STREET. IS THERE ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING? CLERK MAYOR YORD. --
01:04:03.146: >> Clerk Beaudry: MAYOR Y, I DOT SEE ANYONE WITH THEIR HANDS UP TO THERE ARE HEARING.
01:04:11.822: >> Mayor Taylor: SEEING NO ONE THIS PUBLIC HEARING IS CLOSED. DS-1, RESOLUTION TO ADOPT ANN ARBOR CITY BUDGET AND RELATED PROPERTY TAX MILLAGE RATES FOR FISCAL YEAR 2022. MOVED BY RAMLAWI, SECONDED BY GRAND. DISCUSSION, PLEASE, OF DS-1? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:04:46.957: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: WELL THANK YOU. THESE ARE THE TIMES YOU MISS FORMER COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, BECAUSE SHE WOULD BE HERE AND SHE WOULD HAVE A WHOLE LOT TO SAY. I CAN'T EVEN COME CLOSE. I WON'T EASTBOUND TRY. AND I WAS -- I WANT TO SAY THANKS TO THE STAFF AND MR. CRAWFORD AND OTHERS WHO HAVE RESPONDED TO COUNCILMEMBERS AND, REALLY DO A LOST WORK, YOU KNOW. COUNCILMEMBERS ASK AND THESE FOLKS IN OUR CITY GOVERNMENT, I THINK, ARE HONEST AND FAIR TO THE POINT WHERE -- WHERE I CAN ONLY SPEAK WITH MY INTERACTIONS WITH WHO I SPOKE WITH AND WHOM I HAVE WORKED WITH. I WON'T -- YOU KNOW, AND I CAN JUST SAY THAT I APPRECIATE THE -- THE LEVEL OF SERVICE THAT I HAVE RECEIVED WHEN IT COMES TO CERTAIN THINGS. NOT EVERYTHING, AND I KNOW WHEN IT CAME TO THIS BUDGET, THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT A STRUCTURAL DEFICIT. AND THE D.D.A. IS FACING BIG LOSSES. WE RELY ON 20% OF THEIR BUDGET TO FUND OUR GENERAL FUND. I DIDN'T REALLY WANT TO BRING AMENDMENTS TO THIS BUDGET TO ASK FOR ADDITIONAL SPENDING. I NOTICED THERE'S A LOT OF TRADEOFFS IN HERE, OBVIOUSLY, BUT THERE ARE REWORKINGS WITH SOME AMENDMENTS THAT WE'LL GET TO LATER, THAT I THINK I WILL HAVE MORE TO SAY ON LATER. MY BIGGEST POINT IS TO SAY THANKS AND I THINK WE WILL HAVE A LOT W WHOLE LOT TO SAY ONCE WE GET TO THE AMENDMENTS.
01:06:31.595: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF --
01:06:37.100: >> City Admin. Crawford: MAYOR, THERE'S -- THERE WERE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FOR A COUPLE OF THE AMENDMENTS. I WAS INCLINED TO -- IF THOSE AMENDMENTS MOVE FORWARD TO INTERRUPT AT THAT TIME, IS THAT APPROPRIATE?
01:06:52.282: >> Mayor Taylor: THAT MAKES SENSE IF THE AMENDMENTS ARE OFFERED, WE HEAR THE RELATED QUESTION STAFF RESPONSE, BUT IF YOU THINK OTHERWISE, MR. CRAWFORD, WE WILL ROLL WITH THAT.
01:07:02.325: >> City Admin. Crawford: WE'LL WAIT THEN.
01:07:03.393: >> Mayor Taylor: OKAY. COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
01:07:11.601: >> Councilmember Grand: I GUESS IF WE ARE NOT GOING TO GO IN ORDER. I WOULD JUMP IN WITH AN EASY ONE TO GET US GOING. I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE AMENDMENT 12, WHICH WAS -- WHICH IS THE AMENDMENT TO INCREASE FISCAL YEAR 2022 EXPENDITURES BY $75,000 FOR SUCCESSION PLANNING IN THE CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE.
01:07:31.021: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE A SECOND? SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER DISCH. COUNCILMEMBER GRAND, YOU STILL HAVE THE FLOOR.
01:07:36.459: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. YOU KNOW, AS WE KNOW, OUR CITY ATTORNEY, MR. POSTEMA WILL BE LEAVING US NOT THIS YEAR, BUT NEXT YEAR, AND THEY'RE INCREDIBLY SIGNIFICANT SHOE TO FILL. AND IT MAKES SENSE THAT WE HAVE A PROCESS THAT USES SOME EXTERNAL SUPPORT BUT ALSO LEANS HEAVILY UPON STAFF AND COUNCILMEMBERS ALIKE. SO THERE'S SOME MONEY NOT ONLY FOR A SEARCH BUT WHEN WE DO, AFTER WHAT I HOPE IS A SUCCESSFUL SEARCH, HAVE SOME MONEY IN THE OVERHIRE AS WELL TO HELP WITH THAT TRANSITION AND OTHER -- AND OTHER TRANSITIONS IN THE ATTORNEY'S OFFICE AS MR. POSTEMA BELIEVES THERE WILL BE AT LEAST ONE LIKELY ONE POSITION IN THE ASSISTANT SENIOR ATTORNEY IN FISCAL YEAR 2022 THAT WE MAY NEED SOME OVERHIRE MONEY FOR. AND THAT'S AN INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM AND STAFF DESERVES PRAISE FOR THE SUCCESS OF THE OVERHIRE PROGRAM. THANK YOU TO THE MAYOR FOR COSPONSORING THAT WITH ME.
01:08:47.998: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
01:08:49.199: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES, MY COMMENT IN NO WAY REFLECTS ON THE ABILITY, CALIBER OF THE STAFF, BUT I'M WONDERING, NUMBER ONE, WHY WASN'T THIS INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET TO BEGIN WITH? AND NUMBER TWO, GIVEN THE SIZE OF THE LEGAL DEPARTMENT, IN TERMS OF STAFF AND DOLLARS, IS IT POSSIBLE TO ACCOMPLISH THE GOAL WITHOUT A BUDGET AMENDMENT?
01:09:18.295: >> City Atty. Postema: WELL, COUNCILMEMBER, ONE PART OF IT, THE $25,000 FOR A CONSULTANT WAS JUST APPROVED BY THE ADMIN COMMITTEE. AND SO -- AND THAT'S MOVING FORWARD TO YOU. SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I SUPPOSE COULD HAVE BEEN PUT IN THE BUDGET AT THE TIME, BUT IT'S AN EXTENSE THAT YOU WANT TO INCUR, AND THAT COMES WITH THE RECOMMENDATION FROM THE ADMIN AND THAT'S GOING TO COME TO THE COUNCIL NEXT MONTH IN A UNANIMOUS VOTE FROM THE -- FROM THE ADMIN COMMITTEE. THE OTHER ISSUE ON THE OVERHIRE THERE, WAS MONEY IN OVERHIRE, AND MY UNDERSTANDING, I -- I PUT IN A REQUEST FOR SOME OVERHIRE, BUT I THINK THAT THERE WAS -- THE SOMEONE THAT WAS PUT IN BY MR. CRAWFORD WAS NOT -- DID NOT SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS THAT ISSUE AND SO IT COULD HAVE BEEN PUT IN AT THE TIME, BUT IT'S A REALISTIC ISSUE. SO, YES.
01:10:23.193: >> Councilmember Griswold: OKAY. AND TO CLARIFY, THE $75,000 THEN INCLUDES $25,000 FOR THE CONSULTANT?
01:10:30.500: >> City Atty. Postema: YES, IT DID.
01:10:31.334: >> Councilmember Griswold: OH, OKAY. GREAT.
01:10:34.771: >> City Atty. Postema: YEAH. ON THE OVERHIRE, IT'S A SITUATION THAT WE'RE WATCHING AND SO IT AROSE THIS YEAR AFTER THE INITIAL DISCUSSIONS OF BUDGET. AND SO THE CURRENT OVERHIRE DOESN'T INCLUDE MONEY FOR OVERHIRE IN THIS OFFICE, WHERE IT HAS IN THE PAST. AND SO WE GOT THAT CLARIFICATION. AND SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO SAY.
01:10:59.763: >> Councilmember Griswold: OKAY. THANK YOU. I JUST THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO HAVE THIS DISCUSSION FOR THE PUBLIC GIVEN THAT WE ARE CUTTING MANY DEPARTMENTS.
01:11:11.441: >> INTERPRETER: AND I THINK YOU WILL ADDRESS IT WHEN -- NEXT MONTH WHEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING -- DISCUSSING THE SUCCESS PLAN.
01:11:19.282: >> Councilmember Griswold: MM-HMM.
01:11:23.686: >> City Atty. Postema: AND THAT WHOLE PROCESS WILL BE VERY TRANSPARENT AND I APPRECIATE YOU MENTIONING THAT.
01:11:29.459: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:11:30.560: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I THOUGHT WHEN COUNCILMEMBER GRAND SAID SHE WAS STARTING WITH AN EASY ONE, SHE WAS GOING TO 14. 12 IS RELATIVELY EASY AS WELL. MY QUESTION REALLY IS THE SAME AS -- AS -- SOME OF IT IS THE SAME AS COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD, WHY WASN'T THIS $50,000 FOR OVERHIRE BUDGETED ORIGINALLY? WE DID DO THAT YEARS PRIOR AND WE DIDN'T NEED A BUDGET AMENDMENT WHEN -- WHEN IT CAME TO THIS DAY. SO, YOU KNOW, I UNDERSTAND $25,000 AND I'M IN SUPPORT OF IT. AND JUST, AGAIN, JUST -- I WISH THAT $50,000 WAS IN THERE TO BEGIN WITH, AND IT DOESN'T REQUIRE AN AMENDMENT. AND NOT A BIG THING BUT WE'LL MOVE ON. THANK YOU AND I WILL SUPPORT THIS.
01:12:17.173: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE AMENDMENT? ALL IN FAVOR OF AMENDMENT NUMBER 12? PLEASE SAY AYE. OPPOSED? AMENDMENTUMBER 12 IS APPROVED. FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN MOTION AS AMENDED?
01:12:32.589: >> Councilmember Nelson: EXCUSE ME, JEFF, DID YOU VOTE NO?
01:12:39.662: >> Mayor Taylor: I DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING. IS THERE A DISSENT, COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER? IF ANYONE HAS NOT HAD THEIR DISSENT RECOGNIZED, PLEASE LET US KNOW NOW OR LATER SO THAT IT CAN BE PUT ON THE RECORD, BUT OTHERWISE, I DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING, AND I -- OF COURSE, I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING:  SO WE'LL ROLL FROM TRE COUNLMEMBER HAYNER, DID YOU VOTE -- COCILMEMR HNER, WHETHER YOU VOTED NO OPEN THAT AND I GUESS I'M CONFIRMING, DID YOU VOTE NO ON THAT OR DID YOU VOTE YES?
01:13:18.568: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I VOTED NO.
01:13:20.136: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AMENDMENT 12 IS APPROVED WITH 11 COUNCILMEMBERS PRESENT, AND 10 VOTING IN THE AFFIRMATIVE, COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER VOTING IN OPPOSITION. FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN MOTION AS AMENDED. COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS?
01:13:42.525: >> Councilmember Briggs: YEAH. I WOULD JUST LIKE TO RECORD AMENDMENT NUMBER 2, THE HEALTHY STREETS DEPLOYMENT.
01:13:52.669: >> Mayor Taylor: SECONDED BY? COUNCICOUNCILMEMBER SONGS. COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
01:13:57.173: >> Councilmember Briggs: OKAY. ACTUALLY, WE HAD A LENGTHY DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS AT OUR LAST MEETING. I STILL -- IT STILL COMES FORWARD WITH THE UNANIMOUS SUPPORT OF THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION, JUST A FEW REASONS, ADDITIONAL REASONS I DIDN'T THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE INCLUDE IT IN FISCAL YEAR '22 BUDGET. OBVIOUSLY, WE ALREADY SPENT $40,000 FOR DESIGN WORK. WE VOTED FOR THAT AND I DIDN'T GIVE DIRECTION TO STAFF TO BRING THINGS BACK TO US. COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD ACTUALLY SUPPORTED THAT AT THE TIME. AND THAT MEANT THAT WE DRAFTED NOT ONLY RESOURCES AND THE DESIGN BUT WE ALSO PUT PRECIOUS STAFF RESOURCES INTO BRINGING THIS FORWARD TO -- BRINGING BACK THIS PROGRAM TO US, WHAT WE HAVE SEEN FROM COMMUNITY SURVEYS IS THAT THERE'S A MAJORITY SUPPORT FOR THIS DEPLOYMENT. AND, YOU KNOW THIS PROGRAM IS OBVIOUSLY PARTLY PARENT FOR PANDEMIC REASONS BUT IT'S ALSO INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT FOR ADVANCING OUR CARBON NEUTRALITY AND VISION ZERO GOALS. IF YOU LOOK AT LAST YEAR, SORT OF THE PRELIMINARY DATA FOR 2020, IT SHOWED THAT ALTHOUGH THERE WERE FEWER CARS ON THE ROAD NATIONALLY, THE FATALITIES JUMPED 20% IN 2020 COMPARED TO 2019. IF YOU LOOK AT THE TREND IN ANN ARBOR, AT LEAST ON OUR HEALTHY STREETS, WHAT WE SAW IS A DECREASE IN SPEEDS AND A DID DECREASE IN BICYCLE AND PEDESTRIAN CRASHES IN THE DEPLOYMENT AREA. THIS IS A REAL SUCCESS. THIS PROGRAM 1:00 BROUGHT FORWARD IN -- PROGRAM IS BEING BROUGHT FORWARD IN A MODIFIED VERSION AND THERE'S TWO PERMANENT PROJECTS ON PACKARD ONE, STRONG PILOT PROGRAM ON MAIN STREET THAT WILL LET US IDENTIFY HOW TO MOVE FORWARD THERE. AND 34 NEIGHBORHOOD SLOW STREETS PROGRAMS, WHICH I WILL STOP THERE.
01:15:47.483: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE AMENDMENT? COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD?
01:15:51.421: >> Councilmember Griswold: I'M SUPPORTING THE TWO MAIN STREETS. THE NEIGHBORHOOD SLOW STREETS I QUESTION SOME OF THE DATA THAT WAS PRESENTED BASED ON THE FACT THAT THERE WERE VERY FEW CARS. I ASK FOR A LEGAL OPINION REGARDING THE NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS, GIVEN THAT THE PUBLIC OVERWHELMINGLY SUPPORTED A MILLAGE FOR SIDEWALK GAPS. THAT INDICATES TO ME THAT PEOPLE WANT THEIR CHILDREN ON THE SIDEWALK AND OUT OF DANGEROUS STREETS. I MAY GET A LITTLE UPSET. I ACTUALLY HAVE TO LEAVE. I BELIEVE THAT ANYONE WOULD VOTES FOR THIS IS INTERESTING BEHAVIOR UNBECOMING OF A COUNCILMEMBER. THEY ARE IGNORING THE DATA. THEY ARE IGNORING REALITY THAT EXISTS TODAY. NOT ONLY IS TRAFFIC UP, BUT THERE'S NOW A RUSH HOUR PERIOD IN THE MID-AFTERNOON BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE WORKING FROM HOME AND DRIVING TO SCHOOL. I BELIEVE THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE IS WE ARE SENDING CHILDREN OUT INTO THE STREETS NO TO SLOW TRAFFIC. THAT IS UNCONSCIONABLE AND THE VEHICLE MIX HAS CHANGED. I TOOK A PICTURE TODAY, OF MYSELF IN FRONT OF A PICKUP TRUCK WHERE THE TOP OF THE HOOD CAME UP TO MY H ARMPITS. THE RESULT OF THAT IS IF YOU ARE HIT BY A PICKUP STRUCK OR AN SUV WITH ONE OF THE MORE SQUARE FRONT ENDS, IT DOESN'T MATTER THE SPEED OF THE VEHICLE. IT WILL SLAM INTO YOUR BODY AND YOU ARE VERY LIKELY TO BE PULLED UNDER THE VEHICLE AND RUN OVER BY THE TIRES. YOU WILL BE DEAD. IT DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S 5 MILES PER HOUR, 20, OR 30 MILES PER HOUR. THERE ARE MANY OTHER REASONS FOR THIS BUT WE CANNOT -- IN SUMMARY, WE CANNOT IGNORE REALITY. THE TRAFFIC THAT WE HAVE. THE LEVEL OF TRAFFIC THAT WE HAD LAST YEAR IS NOT THE LEVEL OF TRAFFIC THAT WE HAVE THIS YEAR. AND, AGAIN, I PLEAD WITH YOU TO VOTE FOR THIS IS A VOTE TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE RISK THAT A CHILD WILL DIE THIS SUMMER IN ANN ARBOR. THANK YOU.
01:18:27.844: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:18:28.911: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I DIDN'T SUPPORT THIS. AND I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING IT TONIGHT FOR SO MANY DIFFERENT REASONS. IT'S NOT BECAUSE I CAN'T BELIEVE IN SAFETY. IT'S BECAUSE I THINK WE NEED HAVE OUR PRIORITY REALIGNED WITH REALITY. THIS WHEREAS CLAUSE REFERS TO THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC. THE CDC HAS RELEASED GUIDELINES, IF YOU ARE FULLY VACCINATED, YOU DON'T HAVE TO WEAR A MASK OUTSIDE OR INSIDE. THE RESTRICTIONS ARE LOOSER AND LOOSER AND LESS. THE REASONS WHY WE DID THIS LAST YEAR DON'T EXIST RIGHT NOW. AND I UNDERSTAND THERE'S SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT COMFORTABLE AND THEY WILL DOUBLE MASK UNTIL THE END OF SUMMER AND THAT'S THEIR RIGHT AND I BAUD THEM. BUT FOR US TO BE PUTTING OUR RESOURCES IN AREAS LIKE THIS, IS DEPRIVING OUR RESOURCES FROM OTHER AREAS THAT NEED ATTENTION. OUR NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS, THE PAVEMENT CONDITIONS, ARE IN SOME PARTS THIRD WORLD NATIONS. AND THOSE SAME STREETS PEOPLE WALK ON AND DRIVE ON. TO SUGGEST THEY ARE ONLY USED FOR CARS IS INCOMPLETE. WE USE THESE STREETS FOR EVERYTHING. AND I GET EMAILS ALL THE TIME WHEN IS MY STREET GONNA GET FIXED? WELL, WE WILL SAY A LOT OF MONEY FROM THAT, THAT WE COULD BE DOING IT AND PUTTING IT INTO THESE OTHER PROGRAMS THAT I DON'T THINK LINE UP WITH WHERE OUR PRIORITIES OUGHT TO BE. I HAVE A QUESTION ON THE DATA BECAUSE THE STATE IS COMPLETELY UNUNDERSTANDABLE. I HAVE A CONSTITUENT, AND YOU ALL KNOW HIM, SEND US A LETTER TODAY. HE WENT THROUGH AND COUNTED ALL THE FOR AND AGAINST. WHAT HE COMES UP WITH IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE BASE OUR DECISIONS ON. THERE'S MORE PEOPLE AGAINST THESE THAN FOR 'EM, WHEN GO THROUGH THERE AND ACTUALLY COUNT THEM UP. I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY OF US COUNTED THOSE 1,000 RESPONSES AND THE VAGUENESS OF HOW THEY COULD BE CATEGORIZED, BUT THE DATA WAS NOT GIVEN TO US IN A COHESIVE, UNDERSTANDABLE WAY. IT'S IT'S ALL JUST KIND OF SMOOSHED TOGETHER AND GIVEN TO US IN A WAY THAT IS NOT CLEAR AND ONE THAT FRANKLY DOESN'T TEEM TO BE AS CLEAR AS SOME MEMBERS OF COUNCIL WOULD LIKE IT TO BE TO SUPPORT THIS. THERE'S NOT A CLEAR INDICATOR HERE THAT THERE'S SUPPORT FOR THIS, TO SPEND $400,000, WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE $40,000 WE ALREADY SPENT. $400,000 ON THREE MONTHS? I MEAN, TO ME, IT'S -- AGAIN, I CAN'T VOTE FOR IT. YOU SAID SOMETHING ABOUT DATA BEING COLLECTED. WAS DATA COLLECTED ON SPEEDS AND CRASHES IN THE SLOW STREET NEIGHBORHOOD AREA?
01:21:43.572: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER, YOU'RE AT THREE MINUTES.
01:21:45.608: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  YOU CAN USE THE TWO MINUTES.
01:21:50.413: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER EYER.
01:21:51.247: >> Councilmember Eyer: I WILL BE VOTING FOR, THIS HAPPILY SO. I THINK HOPE WE CAN TONE DOWN THIS OVERHEATED RHETORIC. LET'S JUST KEEP THE FOCUS ON POLICY AND NOT ON, YOU KNOW, TRYING TO, YOU KNOW, MAKE PEOPLE OUT TO BE OGRES IF THEY VOTE FOR SOMETHING OR AGAINST SOMETHING. THIS IS REALLY -- THIS IS SOMETHING THAT A LOT OF PROGRESSIVE CITIES ARE DOING. THIS IS PROGRESSIVE POLICY. IT IS NEIGHBORHOOD DRIVEN. IT IS, YOU KNOW, SOMETHING THAT NEIGHBORS -- THAT THE NEIGHBORHOODS ASK FOR, AND THAT THE CITY IS FACILITATING FOR THEM. SO, YOU KNOW, I VIEW THIS AS REALLY NEIGHBORHOOD FRIENDLY. THE OTHER THING THAT I REALLY LIKE ABOUT IT IS THAT IT HELPS TRAIN US TO THINK OF OUR STREETS AS BELONGING TO EVERYBODY, NOT JUST DRIVERS, BUT, YOU KNOW, KIDS ON BIKES, PEDESTRIANS, YOU KNOW. IT FORCES US AS DRIVERS TO SLOW DOWN AND, YOU KNOW, TO REALLY RECOGNIZE THAT OUR STREETS ARE NOT JUST FOR CARS. THEY ARE FOR ALL OF US. AND THEY ALL -- ARE -- WE ALL SHOULD BENEFIT FROM THEM. I GUESS THE FINAL THING IS THE IDEA THAT WE COULD BE PAVING STREETS INSTEAD OF -- INSTEAD OF DOING THIS AND I DON'T THINK THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY -- YOU KNOW, IT'S -- OF COURSE, IT SEEMS LIKE A LOT. IT'S MORE THAN POCKET CHANGE, YOU KNOW TO US AS INDIVIDUALS, BUT IN TERMS OF WHAT WE WOULD ACTUALLY GET FOR PAVING WITH THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY IS PROBABLY JUST A FEW BLOCKS, IF I'M -- IF I'M WRONG ON THAT, I HOPE THE CITY STAFF WILL CORRECT ME, BUT I THINK THAT'S ACCURATE. THANK YOU.
01:23:44.527: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND?
01:23:45.594: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU, I WILL BE ENTHUSIASTICALLY SUPPORTING THIS. JUST A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT I HEARD. AND ONE OF THEM IS BECAUSE THIS IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO OUR CITY, BUT ALSO TO MY WARD. SOME OF THESE PERMANENT INSTALLATIONS ARE ONES THAT WE HAVE HEARD PRETTY CONSISTENTLY, THAT RESIDENTS IN THE THIRD WARD HAVE ENJOYED AND HELP THEM FEEL SAFER, CONNECTING FROM THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS TO OTHER PARTS OF THE CITY, AND I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT SOME OF THE PACKARD INTERSECTIONS THAT ARE FINALLY RECTIFIED. SOME THEM ARE NOT TEMPORARY, BUT THEY ARE PERMANENT. THEY ARE PERMANENT TO ME AS A CYCLE THAT HAVE BEEN PRETTY DANGEROUS. I ALSO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT WHILE I AM UNOR INCREDIBLY -- I AM INCREDIBLY ENTHUSIASTIC IN TERMS OF OUR VACCINATION RATES AND TAKE GREAT PRIDE I THINK NUMBER TWO IN THIS STATE -- I WOULD LOVE FOR US TO BE NUMBER ONE, THAT THERE ARE MANY MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY, PARTICULARLY THOSE UNDER THE AGE OF 12 THAT ARE NOT ABLE TO BE VACCINATED AND WON'T BE ABLE TO BE VACCINATED FOR SOME TIME. SO WHAT WE HAVE BEEN HEARING VERY CONSISTENTLY AS PARENTS OF YOUNGER CHILDREN, MANY OF WHOM ACTIVITIES BECAUSE THE LONG-TERM PLANNING AND THE FACT THAT THEY ARE NOT VACCINATED IS PLEASE GIVE US SOME OTHER ALTERNATIVES FOR THINGS THAT WE CAN DO OUTSIDE WITH OUR KIDS, BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE A LOT OF THEIR SOCIALIZATION -- THAT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT ABOUT THE LAST YEAR AND H A HALF TAKES PLE FOR THEM. REALLY THANKS TO THE COSPONSORS.
01:25:31.267: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
01:25:32.134: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WILL TAKE MY TIME TO RUN OFF WHAT ONE OF OUR CONSTITUENTS SENT TO US, WHICH JUST GENTLY SHES BACK BY USINGHE MATH THAT'S IN THE STASTICS, THE NOON THAT TRE'S A MASSIVE GRND SLL F TS PROGR. OVERL, THE COMMENTS WERE 4 AGAINST TO 446 FOR IT. SEVERAL OF THE STREETS THAT ARE STILL IN THE STUDY, LIKE JEWITT, 14 HADN'T 4. SO THIS IS NOT NEIGHBORHOODS CLAMORING FOR THIS TO HAPPEN. THIS IS A DIDN'T AN EFFORT TO TRY SOME NEW THINGS, YOU KNOW, AND ARE SUPPOSEDLY GOING TO HAVE SOME RESULTS THAT WE CAN'T MEASURE. THE THING I'M TAKING THROUGH THIS WHOLE MEETING. THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS WE DO AS A COMMUNICATE AND THERE ARE SOME THING -- COMMUNITY AND THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT WE DO AS A COMMUNITY THAT ARE GOOD BUT WE DON'T HAVE A WAY TO QUANTIFY IT. AND THE OTHER THING IS PEOPLE BREAK THEIR ANKLES AND THEN BLAME THE CITY. WELL, THEY SHOULD, PERHAPS BECAUSE OUR STREETS ARE TERRIBLE AND S SOME OF OUR DOWNTOWN AND NEAR DOWNTOWN CROSSWALKS ARE IN TERRIBLE CONDITION. I'M SURE WE COULD REPAVE, MANY, MANY CROSSWALKS FOR $300,000 OR $400,000 THAT WE WILL SPEND TO SLOW DOWN SOME TRAFFIC IN SOME NEIGHBORHOODS AND CREATE INCREASED TRAFFIC IN OTHER STREETS AND SO MY CONCERNS ABOUT THIS ARE MORE THAT THERE'S A LOT TV TEMPO TELEPHONE NUMBER -- A F TEMPORARY STILL, THAT IT'S NOT CALLED FOR THE RESIDENTS. THE ONE THING WE HAVE BEEN TOLD IS WE HAVE A STRUCTURAL DEFICIT AND WE ARE SUPPOSED TO TRIM OUR SPENDING NOT INCRE INCREASING TE SPENDING. I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM BEING A BUDGET HAWK ON THIS. IT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS AND IF YOU LISTEN TO WHAT WAS TOLD TO US, YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE OFF SPENDING MONEY LIKE THIS. AND LIKE I SAY, IT'S OVERDUE, LIKE PACKARD, BUT SOME OF THIS, IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE FOR THE REROUTING OF THE TRAFFIC. I THINK IT'S GOING TO INCREASE THE CARBON EMISSIONS. I THINK IT WILL INCREASE THE FRUSTRATION FROM DRIVERS. YOU CAN'T FIX ANGRY DRIVERS BY CLOSING STREETS AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT WE WILL DO TO FIX THOSE FOLKS. BUT I EVEN SEE PEOPLE WHO PEEL OUT HALFWAY DOWN THE BLOCK AT MAINARD RIGHT NEXT TO THE CLOSED STREET WHERE PEOPLE ARE DINING! I HAVE SEEN PEOPLE SMOKING TIRES ON THAT STREET. AND SO WE HAVE A DRIVER PROBLEM IN THIS TOWN. I ADMIT, IT I DRIVE AND BIKE ALSO AND WALK, BUT I DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING TO FIX IT THROUGH THIS. SO I'M NOT GOING TO SUPPORT THIS. I'M SORRY.
01:28:30.245: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS.
01:28:33.415: >> Councilmember Briggs: YEAH, I JUST WANTED TO REMIND COUNCIL THAT WE APPROVED  $6 MILLION FOR ROAD RESURFACING AND I WANTED TODAY ASK IF MR. HESS -- SINCE QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN RAISED AROUND THE ACCURACY OF THE -- YOU KNOW THE FOR AND AGAINST AND THE KIND OF OTHER CATEGORY, IF YOU MIGHT BE AI BELIEVE TO SPEAK A LITTLE BIT TO MORE HOW THAT WAS TALLIED AND JUST HOW THE STREETS WERE SELECTED.
01:29:04.813: >> YES, COUNCILMEMBERS, THIS IS RAYMOND HESS. THAT WAS SELF-IDENTIFIED. SO WHEN PEOPLE FILLED OUT THE SURVEY, THEY WERE ASKED IF THEY WERE IN SUPPORT OF OR MAKE NO CHANGES OR OTHER. SO STAFF DID NOT CATEGORIZE THEM, AND DID NOT MAKE ANY INTERPRETATION OF THOSE COMMENTS. WE GAVE YOU ALL OF THE DATA, ALL OF IT IN TOTALITY. SO THAT THAT WAY YOU COULD LOOK AT IT. WE DIDN'T, YOU KNOW, TRY TO PUT IT IN THE BUCKETS. WE DIDN'T CHANGE ANY ANSWERS. YOU HAVE ALL THE RAW DATA BEFORE YOU. WHEN YOU SEE THE SUPPORT, THAT'S HOW RESPONDENTS. WHEN YOU SEE 393 IN OPPOSITION. AND THEN 111 OTHER, THAT'S HOW RESPONDENTS IDENTIFIED THEMSELVES.
01:29:56.865: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
01:29:58.033: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WILL MAKE ONE OTHER REMARK. WE HAD A WORK SESSION AND A PRESENTATION FROM A SAM SCHWARTZ COMPANY, AND WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN DOING FOR US. AND I THINK WE SHOULD LOOK TO THAT GUIDANCE. THE THING THAT WAS MOST CURIOUS AND DISTURBING TO ME WAS THE BULK OF THE PRESENTATION WAS TELLING US HOW THEY HAD ENGAGED THE COMMUNITY AND SO ON, AND HOW MUCH COMMUNITY OUTREACH WAS DONE AND THIS AND THAT. AND THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT, BUT THERE WAS ZERO OVERVIEW OF WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO BE DOING. NOW, WE'RE ALL SUPPOSED TO HAVE READ THAT, BUT IT DIDN'T HELP THE PUBLIC IN THAT MATTER THERE. WAS NO OVERVIEW OF WHAT THIS PLAN WAS GOING TO DO, WHAT ACTIONABLE THING THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO DO WHAT ORDER WE WERE SUPPOSED TO DO THEM, AND SO ON. GIVEN BY THAT PRESENTER. AND SO I WOULD JUST LIKE TO ASK SOMEBODY WHO IS A FERVENT SUPPORTER OF THIS PROGRAM, WHERE DID THEY SEE THAT FITTING IN WITH -- WHERE DO THEY SEE THIS FITTING IN WITH THE PRESENTATION THAT WE WERE GIVEN LAST WEEK? IF SOMEBODY WANTS TO SHOW ME HOW THIS IS AN IMPORTANT -- THAT CLOSING THESE STREETS BECAUSE PEOPLE CAN GO AROUND THEM. PEOPLE HAVE TO GET CARS INTO THEIR DRIVEWAYS AND SO ON, HOW THIS JIVES WITH WHAT WE WERE GIVEN LAST WEEK. I JUST -- I THINK -- I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN HEARING AND I THINK THE PUBLIC WOULD BE TOO.
01:31:34.930: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
01:31:43.605: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WOULD LIKE TO OFFER AN AMENDMENT. I SUPPORT THE PACKAGE AND MAIN PROJECTS. I DO NOT SUPPORT THE NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS. SO THE AMENDMENT WOULD BE TO STRIP OUT THE NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS.
01:32:12.167: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. CRAWFORD, ARE WE ABLE TO DETERMINE IF THIS IS -- OFTENTIMES WE CAN ROLL WITH THOSE GENERAL STATEMENTS. THAT BEING A BUDGET AMENDMENT, WE DO NEED TO GET DOLLARS IN AND DOLLARS OUT. IS STAFF TABLE TO ACCOMMODATE?
01:32:33.155: >> City Admin. Crawford: STAFF PROVIDED SOME AMENDMENTS EARLIER TODAY. SO WE CAN DO AN ESTIMATE WITH THOSE ESTIMATES AND I WOULD REFER TO THEM AS ESTIMATED.
01:32:40.929: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THAT OKAY TO REFER TO THEM AS ESTIMATES IN THIS AMENDMENT?
01:32:43.932: >> City Admin. Crawford: IT IS FROM MY VIEW. MS. PRASCHAN, DO YOU HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH THAT?
01:32:51.373: >> NO, THAT WOULD BE FINE.
01:32:58.313: >> Mayor Taylor: SO COUNCILWOMAN GRISWOLD, CAN YOU RESTATE YOUR MOTION?
01:33:03.485: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I MOVE THAT WE REMOVE THE NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS COMPONENT FROM AMENDMENT NUMBER 2.
01:33:16.565: >> Mayor Taylor: I NEED DOLLARS AND CENTS. I NEED ESTIMATED DOLLARS. I DON'T HAVE THAT IN FRONT OF ME. MAYBE MR. CRAWFORD DOES.
01:33:33.982: >> Clerk Beaudry: MAYOR IS THAT POSSIBLY THE LAST RESOLVE CLAUSE?
01:33:37.853: >> Mayor Taylor: I DON'T KNOW.
01:33:38.587: >> THAT WOULD BE CORRECT, JACKIE.
01:33:42.858: >> Clerk Beaudry: THE LAST RESOLVE REFERENCES THE LOCAL STREET FUND BY $33,143.
01:33:47.629: >> CORRECT.
01:33:53.702: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THAT ADEQUATE FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE.
01:33:57.005: >> Councilmember Griswold: THAT'S ADEQUATE FROM MY PERSPECTIVE.
01:34:00.275: >> Mayor Taylor: I HAVE A SECOND FROM COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI. YOU HAVE THE FLOOR, COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
01:34:10.385: >> Councilmember Griswold:  AT THIS POINT, I BELIEVE WE ARE IGNORING DATA AND THEREFORE WE ARE IN CONFLICT WITH VISION ZERO AND OUR NET TO BE ADOPTED TRANSPORTATION PLAN. I BELIEVE BASED ON THE CDC, THAT THERE'S NO HEALTH REASON TO REQUIRE OUTDOOR SOCIAL DISTANDISTANCING. SO THERE'S NO HEALTH REASON FOR OUR CHILDREN TO BE WALKING IN THE STREET WHEN THERE'S A SIDEWALK PROVIDED. I BELIEVE THAT INDICATING THAT CHILDREN SHOULD WALK IN THE STREET, GIVING THEM THE SENSE OF SAFETY, THAT THEY CAN WALK IN THE STREET, BY THIS COUNCIL FAR EXCEEDS ANY NEGATIVE -- ANY NEGATIVE FEELINGS THAT WOULD BE DERIVED FROM A COUPLE OF ANYONE APPROPRIATE WORDS HERE. WE ARE NOT THAT YOU CANNING ABOUT WORDS HERE. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT -- TALKING ABOUT WORDS HERE. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT SOMEONE GOING AGAINST COMMON SENSE BY TELLING OUR CHILDREN THAT THEY CAN WALK IN THE STREET WHEN THERE IS ONE, IF NOT TWO SIDEWALKS AVAILABLE FOR THEM. THANK YOU.
01:35:34.469: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS ON THE AMENDMENT TO THE AMENDMENT.
01:35:40.008: >> Councilmember Briggs: I WON'T BE SUPPORTING THIS, BUT I WILL POINT OUT THAT $33,000 IS NOT THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT. STAFF HAS PROVIDED THE OVERALL AND I BELIEVE THE COST OF SEPARATING IT OUT FOR THE -- IT WAS $50,000 OVERALL IF THEY WERE SEPARATE, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT TURNS OUT TO BE. BUT THERE ARE INDIVIDUAL NUMBERS FOR THE OTHER TWO PROJECTS. PERHAPS  -- OBVIOUSLY COUNCILWOMAN GRISWOLD DOESN'T WANT TO VEE FOLKS USING THEIR STREETS -- SEE FOLKS USING THEIR STREETS THAT ARE NOT IN CARS. OUR STREETS ARE THERE FOR -- OUR NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS ARE THERE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE WALKING AND BIKING AND I CERTAINLY WANT TO MY SON AND HIS FRIENDS OUT SCOOTERRING AND WALKING AND BIKING AND HAVING FUN. THESE ARE NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS. THIS IS WHAT I CERTAINLY WANT FOR OUR COMMUNITY AND OUR NEIGHBORHOODS, IS THAT WE HAVE THE TYPES OF NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE IT IS SAFE TO GO OUT AND ENJOY OUR NEIGHBORHOODS. I THINK THAT'S THE COMPREHENSIVE TRANSPORTATION PLAN IS LEADING US TOWARDS AND MANY REASONS WHY WE ARE HAVING THE NEIGHBORHOOD SLOW STREETS PROGRAM IS TO SLOW TRAFFIC DOWN AND PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE USING THE SPACE AND THIS IS ENTIRELY IN LINE WITH OUR TRANSPORTATION PLAN VISION ZERO IS ALL ABOUT LOWER SPEEDS. SO THAT'S ALL.
01:37:18.340: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER, RAMLAWI, EYER, RADINA. WE HAVE SPOKEN ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR AMENDMENT FOR 20, 25 MINUTES. WE HAVE OTHERS TO GO. MY SUSPICIONS IS THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND HOW THEY ARE GOING TO VOTE AND THAT WE SHOULDN'T SPEAK FOR DURATIONS WITH THIS IN MIND.
01:37:40.996: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I DO SUPPORT THIS THE HEALTHY STREETS CAUSES A LOT OF CONFUSION, REROUTING TRAFFIC, FRUSTRATED DRIVERS, CONFUSED, DISORIENTED. WE ARE SENDING MIXED SIGNALS. IN SOME CASES, I HEAR THAT WE WILL PUT HUMANS OUT THERE TO SLOW DOWN TRAFFIC. I DON'T THINK THAT'S APPROPRIATE POLICY. THERE'S VERY LITTLE LIKELIHOOD OF OUTDOOR DECISIONS. WE SHOULD BE BASING OUR DECISIONS ON SCIENCE. THE LIKELIHOOD OF OUTDOOR TRANSITION IS MINUSCULE. WE ARE INCASINARBO EMSION WEAVE AOTF UNINTENDS CONSEQUENCES AND FRUSTRATION AND THERE IS NO CLEAR INDICATION THAT THESE ARE SUPPORT ADJOURN SPECKINGLY BY THE VOKES WHO LIVE ON -- SUPPORT SPECIFICALLY BY THE FOLKS WHO LIVE ON THESE STREETS. IT'S NOT BASED IN SCIENCE OR BASED ON SUPPORT FROM RESIDENTS WHO LIVE ON THOSE STREETS. IT'S ALL IDEOLOGICALLY DRIVEN. AND SO WE SHOULDN'T BE SENDING OUR SIDES IN  KIDS IN THE STREEE HAVE 160 OR SO PARKS AND SIDEWALKS AND MANY OTHER AREAS TO PLAY. IT'S DANGEROUS TO PLAY IN THE STREETS. YES, WE CAN USE THEM FOR ALL DIFFERENT MODES OF TRANSPORTATION, BUT TO CLAIM THE STREETS, I DON'T KNOW IS -- PUT TO PLAY IN THE STREETS, I DON'T SEND.
01:39:17.892: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER EYER.
01:39:20.128: >> Councilmember Eyer: THANK YOU. IN IS IDEOLOGICALLY DRIVEN. IT'S PROGRESSIVE AND I'M ALL FOR IT. SO I WILL BE REAL BRIEF HERE AND SAY THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK ABOUT HOW ALL OF THESE STREETS HAVE SIDEWALKS IN. MY WARD, THERE ARE SOME OF THESE HEALTHY STREETS REQUESTS THAT DO NOT HAVE SIDEWALKS. SO THERE ARE HUGE SIDEWALK GAPS THROUGHOUT SOME OF THE NEIGHBORHOODS FOURTH WARD. RESIDENTS ARE ASKING FOR THIS. PEOPLE WITH CHILDREN, YOUNG CHILDREN, ESPECIALLY, THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC HAVE UNDERSTOOD WHY IT'S NECESSARY AND FRANKLY, THIS IS A POSTPANDEMIC PROGRESSIVE POLICY. PROGRESSIVE CITIES ARE ADOPTING THIS GOING FORWARD. THEY ARE RECOGNIZING THE VALUE OF IT AND, YOU KNOW, I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE'RE LEARNING FROM THIS PANDEMIC, LESSONS THAT PELL TAKE FORWARD WITH US, AND THIS IS ONE OF THEM THAT SLOWING DOWN TRAFFIC ON OUR STREETS AND LOW SLOWING DOWN CARS FOR BICYCLES AND SCOOTERSERS AND KIDS. THESE ARE PROGRESSIVE IDEAS AND I'M ALL FOR THE PROGRESSIVE IDEOLOGY. SO SIGN ME UP.
01:40:47.448: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RADINA. THANK YOU. I WILL BE BRIEF.
01:40:56.224: >> Councilmember Radina: I'M GOING TO OPPOSE THIS BECAUSE I'M LISTENING DIRECTLY TO MY CONSTITUENTS. ONE THE NEIGHBORHOODS THAT THESE THREE STREETS HAVE SIDEWALK GAPS THAT NEED TO BE FILLED AND IT IS DANGEROUS FOR FOLKS RIGHT NOW TO BE TRAVERSING THROUGH THAT NEIGHBORHOOD, KNOWING THAT THERE ARE GAPS THERE. AND I WANT TO BRIEFLY RESPOND TO WHAT I WOULD CHARACTERIZE AS A LOT OF HYPERBOLE BY USING CHILDREN, PUTTING THEM IN THE STREET TO SLOW DOWN TRAFFIC. I TAKE EXCEPTION TO THAT. THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS IS SLOWING DOWN OUR STREETS IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE SAFE AND ACCESSIBLE FOR ALL OF OUR RESIDENTS. AND SO OUR STREETS SHOULD ALREADY BE SAFE. OUR NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS WOULD ALREADY BE SLOW. AND THEY SHOULD BE ACCESSIBLE TO ALL OF OUR RESIDENTS REGARDLESS OF THEIR MODE OF TRANSPORTATION, WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE WALKING OR BIKING OR ROLLER SKATING OR ALL OF THOSE THINGS, AND TO SUGGEST THAT WE ARE USING THEM TO SLOW DOWN TRAFFIC, SOMEHOW PUTTING THEM IN HARM'SWAY. THE COST IS ASSOCIATED TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR STREETS ARE SAFE SO THE PEOPLE WHO THEY ARE DESIGNATED FOR CAN USE THEM. I WILL FULLY SUPPORT THIS NEIGHBORHOOD SLOW STREETS PROGRAM. I'M RESPONDING TO THE REQUEST FROM MY CONSTITUENTS WHO NOT AND WANTED IT BUT WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT PERMANENT BECAUSE THEY ARE SEEING TOO MUCH TRAFFIC FLYING DOWN STREETS AND ENDANGERING THEMSELVES AND THEIR CHILDREN.
01:42:29.117: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
01:42:30.852: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WILL SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL. I DON'T THINK SOME OF THE NEIGHBORHOODS ARE LEGITIMATE NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS. YES THERE ARE DRIVEWAYS BUT TO CALL JEWITT A NEIGHBORHOOD STREET WHEN IT HAS LEFT/RIGHT TURN, A DEDICATED TURN LANE OFFER OF PACKARD, IT CREATES A CUT THROUGH, UNFORTUNATELY THROUGH A NEIGHBORHOOD TO SOUTH INDUSTRIAL BUT UNTIL WE RID OURSELVES OF ALL THE CARS, SOUTH INDUSTRIAL IS A STREET THAT'S FULL -- FULL OF VARIOUS SERVICE INDUSTRY PLACES PLUMBING OUTLETS THAT THE TRADE USE. THEY WANT TO GET OUT TO PACKARD AND THEY WANT TO GET TO EISENHOWER AND SO ON. SO JEWITT IS A BIT OF QUANDARY. YES, THERE ARE HOUSES ON IT BUT I WOULD NOT CALL IT A NEIGHBORHOOD STREET. SNARE IN MY WARD, WHERE THOSE STREETS ARE MAJOR EAST/WEST CONNECTIONS. AND I KNOW WE ARE NOT TOTALLY BLOCKING OFF TRAFFIC, I UNDERSTAND THAT, BUT, AGAIN, I DON'T -- I THINK THAT PERHAPS WE SHOULD HAVE COME ONE A BETTER DEFINITION OF WHAT IS A NEIGHBORHOOD STREET AND A BETTER CONSIDERATION OF WHAT MIGHT QUALIFY AS A STREET THAT'S A VERY LOW TRAFFIC STREET VERSUS A JEWITT OR A SUMMIT OR A SUNSET, WHICH IS A BIG IMPORTANT ACCESS. I THINK THIS IS NOT IMPLEMENTED PROPERLY, WHICH IS WHY I WON'T SUPPORT IT.
01:44:11.319: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER SONG.
01:44:12.820: >> Councilmember Song: JUST REALLY QUICKLY, THERE ARE SIDEWALK GAPS IN OUR COMMUNITY. HERE IN WARD TWO, AS WELL AS I THINK -- I WOULD ENCOURAGE MY COLLEAGUES TO IMAGINE CHILDREN PLAYING IN STREETS LIKE HOW CHILDREN PLAY IN CUL-DE-SACS. AND SO IF YOU CAN AFFORD TO BUY A HOME IN A CUL-DE-SAC, YOU ENJOY HAVING KIDS GATHER ROUTINELY. PANDEMIC OR NOT. SO DON'T IMAGINE KIDS IN THE MIDDLE OF GLAZER WAY FROLICKING. I HOPE YOU CAN IMAGINE KIDS GETTING TOGETHER WITH NEARBY NEIGHBORS. SO IMAGINE CUL-DE-SAC. THANK YOU.
01:44:51.893: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
01:44:55.830: >> Councilmember Grand: JUST WHAT COUNCILMEMBER EYER SAID, I WILL DEFINITELY OWN UP TO MY IDEOLOGY AS SAYING THAT I WANT TO SEND THIS IDEA THAT THE RIGHT TO CUT THROUGH A STREET IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE TASTE OF THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE ON IT TO MOVE ABOUT IT AND THEIR NEIGHBORS TO DO SO. SO IF THAT'S A  IDEAL LOGICA IDY DRIVEN, SIGN ME UP. AND I UNDERSTAND SCIENCE. SO THANKS.
01:45:35.803: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE AMENDMENT TO THE AMENDMENT.
01:45:39.874: >> City Admin. Crawford: MAYOR?
01:45:41.742: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. CRAWFORD?
01:45:42.376: >> City Admin. Crawford: AS WE WERE LOOKING THROUGH THE KNEWS JUST FOR CLARIFICATION, THE NUMBERS PROVIDED IN THE AMENDMENT RELATE TO THE RESOLUTION THAT WAS CONSIDERED IT THE PRIOR COUNCIL MEETING. YOU MAY RECALL THAT AT THE TIME WE INDICATED THERE WERE SOME FIXED COSTS THAT ARE HARD TO TEASE OUT. SO IN ORDER TO MOVE THIS AMENDMENT FORWARD TO BE CLEAR, IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO REMOVE THE LAST RESOLVE CLAUSE RELATED TO LOCAL STREETS AND INSERT THE WORD ESTIMATE IN FRONT OF $320,000. THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO RECEIVE THE QUOTES AND MOVE FORWARD.

01:46:33.094: >> City Admin. Crawford: KANSAS CITY.
01:46:33.961: >> Mayor Taylor: SO IT'S A FRIENDLY AMENDMENT TO THE AMENDMENT. AND -- WELL, ACTUALLY, I DON'T THINK WE ARE ALLOWED TO AMEND THE AMENDMENT. BECAUSE WE ARE NOT ORDINARILY ALLOWED TO AMEND AMENDMENTS. I'M LOOKING FOR COUNCIL'S ACQUIESCENCE TO INCLUDE THE WORD "SYSTEM" IN FRONT OF 320 ON THE THEORY THAT THAT WAS COUNCILWOMAN GRISWOLD'S INTENT. I THINK THAT'S A SCRIVENER'S ERROR. DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY OBJECTION TO THAT? FAIR POINT. THE INTRODUCTION OF THE WORD ESTIMATES -- RATHER AN ESTIMATED IN THE $320,830. THE AMENDMENT TO THE AMENDMENT, ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER RADINA?

01:47:57.745: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE AMENDMENT? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:48:07.088: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: SINCE WE HAVE STAFF HERE, THERE WERE QUESTIONS ON HOW MUCH $400,000 WOULD GET US. MS. HUTCHINSON IS HERE. I KNOW YOU CAN'T -- I KNOW EVERY PROJECT IS DIFFERENT. I'M NOT SURE OF THE EXACT TERM WE ARE USING TO DESCRIBE HOW WE GO AND DO OUR PAVEMENT, AND CHOOSING ONE BIG SECTION OF OUR CITY AND DOING THEM IN CHUNKS AS WE RECENTLY HAVE. BUT DO YOU PERHAPS SHED SOME LIGHT AS TO HOW MUCH $400,000 WOULD BE IN ONE OF THOSE PROGRAMS THAT WE ARE ACTIVELY INVOLVED WITH?
01:48:47.228: >> WELL, AS YOU MENTIONED, IT'S GOING TO -- EVERY PROJECT IS DIFFERENT, AND IT'S GOING TO DEPEND ON THE LENGTH OF THE BLOCKS AND THE WID WIDTH OF THE STREET AND THINGS LIKE. THAT THAT'S PROBABLY THREE OR FOUR BLOCKS OF A RESIDENTIAL STREET.
01:49:02.376: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  AND HOW MANY BLOCKS ARE WE USUALLY DOING IN ONE OF THOSE PROJECTS AT A TIME?
01:49:09.483: >> I COULDN'T -- I COULDN'T SAY OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD.
01:49:14.321: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  AND I WOULD LIKE TO, IS IF THE DATA THAT WAS COLLECTED FROM LAST YEAR, AND I KNOW IT WAS AN OFF YEAR, SO IT'S NOT REALLY ALL THAT RELIABLE, AS TO WHAT WE COULD EXPECT IN THE FUTURE WITH SPEEDS AND CRASHES. WHERE -- WHERE -- DID WE HAVE THATY? KNOW I ASKED FOR -- I KNOW THAT I ASKED FOR THE TIMES ON EMERGENCY VEHICLES, AND COUNTS BUT DO WE HAVE DATA AS IT RELATES TO SPEED AND CRASHES? I APOLOGIZE IF IT'S -- AND I DIDN'T SEE IT.
01:49:57.698: >> YES, COUNCIL REMEMBER, THERES A REPORT THAT WE PUT TOGETHER AND IT DID PROVIDE INFORMATION ON EMERGENCY RESPONSE TIMES TO THE EXTENT WE COULD GET THAT INFORMATION, AS WELL AS SAFETY D CRASH DATA AS WELL. THAT WAS FOCUSED ON THE ARTERIAL DEPLOYMENTS. I WILL, YOU KNOW, BRING TO YOUR ATTENTION THAT FACT. BUT WE DID SEE -- YOU KNOW, IT'S HARD TO KNOW WHAT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO WHAT BECAUSE TRAVEL PATTERNS HAVE CHANGED SO MUCH DURING THE PANDEMIC. WE DIDN'T SEE AN INCREASE. WE SAW A DECREASE IN RESPONSE TIMES AS WELL AS CRASHES BUT NAY BE THE FACT THAT THERE'S LESS VEHICLES ON THE ROAD. SO IT'S HARD TO KNOW WHAT IS CAUSE AND EFFECT ON SOME OF THAT DATA.
01:50:42.543: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU.
01:50:45.112: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER COUNCILMEMBERGRISWOLD, I HAVE YN TWE ON THE MAIN AMENDMENT. THANK YOU. FURTHER DISCUSSION OFHE AMENDMENT? I'GOING T VOTE IN FAVOR OF THIS TONIGHT. I BELIEVE THAT IT SPEAKS FOR EVERYONE, AND THAT I HAVE CONFIDENCE IN STAFF'S -- I HAVE CONFIDENCE IN ENGINEERING STAFF'S ABILITY TO MOVE FORWARD THIS PROGRAM IN A WAY THAT BALANCES THE NEEDS OF ALL USERS AND IT DOES SO IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH PUBLIC SAFETY.

01:52:28.382: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE AMENDMENT NUMBER THREE. THIS IS AN AMENDMENT TO -- WELL, LET ME JUST --
01:52:36.590: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE A SECOND? SECONDED BY RAMLAWI. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
01:52:42.563: >> Councilmember Hayner:  THIS IS AN AMENDMENT. THERE ARE SEVERAL ON HERE AND I USED IT AS AN OFFSET AND SO I WON'T EVEN MOVE THAT IF THIS GOES THROUGH. AND I SEE MR. MAYOR, YOU BROUGHT ONE THAT IS, I BELIEVE, ALMOST IDENTICAL AND SO, YOU KNOW, MAYBE THIS IS GOING TO GET THIS OVER. THIS IS THE MOTION TO REMOVE THE DEER CULL FUNDING. IT'S NO SECRET YORK SUPPORT THE DEER CULL. I THINK IT'S A WRONG SOLUTION. I THINK IT'S A SOLUTION LOOKING FOR A PROBLEM, AND I -- I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE -- THE INFORMATION THAT PEOPLE HAVE SEN US AND THE COMMENTS -- SENT US AND THE COMMENTS AND REMARKS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE ON THE VARIOUS IS SIDES OF THIS ISSUE BUT IT'S A MORAL ISSUE FOR ME. I WON'T SUPPORT IT. I'M NOT AGAINST HUNTING OR -- WELL, ACTUALLY, I'M AGAINST HUNTING. I WORK WITH FOLKS WHO HUNT AND THEY DO IT IN A CERTAIN WAY, AND I RESPECT THAT AND I ALSO RESPECT THE INDIGENOUS PEOPLE'S WILLINGNESS TO DO THAT AND THE ABILITY TO DO THAT AND THE RIGHT TO DO THAT, BUT THIS IN CASE, I THINK IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE FOR OUR COMMUNITY. I DON'T LIKE THE IDEA OF SENDING GUNS INTO PARKS AND I DON'T LIKE THE IDEA OF KILLING OUR FURRY NEIGHBORS. I WOULD LIKE THE $120,000 CAN CERTAINLY BE PUT TO A GOOD USE, SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE, OR SOMETHING THAT'S A LITTLE MORE IMPORTANT. SO THIS STRIKES IT FULLY FROM THIS FISCAL YEAR '22 GENERAL FUN BUDGET.
01:54:10.784: >> Mayor Taylor: I WILL SUPPORT THE DEER CULL REMOVAL FROM THE BUDGET. I WOULD HAVE A MATTER OF THE MECHANICS AND INTERACTION BETWEEN THESE RESOLUTIONS -- THIS RESOLUTION AND THE RESOLUTIONS THAT SPEAKS SPECIFICALLY TO REMOVING THE DEER CULL -- OR RATHER, SEEKING OFFCOFFSETTING FROM DEER CULL ALLOCATIONS. AM I CORRECT THAT THIS COULD PASS AND IN WHICH CASE THERE WOULD BE $120,000 GAP AND THEN COUNCIL COULD --
01:54:54.661: >> City Admin. Crawford: IF I'M UNDERSTANDING THIS QUESTION. IF THIS PASSED, YOU WOULD HAVE $120,000 REDUCTION IN SPENDS AND THEN IF ON ANOTHER AMENDMENT, YOU HAD $120,000 ASSUMED, YOU CAN TAKE IT OUT OR LEAVE IT, IN BECAUSE YOU HAVE ALREADY TAKEN THE ACTION AND IF YOU ARE THEN SPENDING A PORTION EVER THAT 120, IT WOULD GO ON THROUGH BECAUSE THAT PART IS ALREADY VALID. DOES THAT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION?
01:55:21.522: >> Mayor Taylor: WHAT I HEAR YOU SAYING WE CAN ROLL ON WITH THE OTHER AMENDMENTS AS THEY ARE?
01:55:26.593: >> City Admin. Crawford: YES, BUT I WILL LOOK AT THEM --
01:55:29.530: >> Mayor Taylor: YOU WILL KEEP TRACK OF NUMBERS BUT IN TERMS OF THE PROCEDURE, THEY CAN GO ON UNAFFECTED AND THEMSELVES UNAMENDED?
01:55:38.405: >> City Admin. Crawford: THAT'S THE WAY SIGH HE IT.
01:55:39.740: >> Mayor Taylor: AND THAT'S THE WAY I WILL SEE IT. I HAVE LONG NOT BEEN A SUPPORTER OF THE DEER CULL. I THINK IT ZAPS PEOPLE'S SENSE OF HOME WHEN WE ARE SHOOTING THINGS IN THE PARKS. AND THAT'S JUST INCONSISTENT WITH MANY MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITIES, SENSE OF THE SELF AND SENSE OF WHERE THEY ARE AND I HAVE VOTED AGAINST THIS IN THE PAST. I WILL SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION -- I WILL SUPPORT THIS AMENDMENT AND I HOPE THAT IT COMES TO PASS. COUNCILMEMBER DISCH.
01:56:20.814: >> Councilmember Disch: THANK YOU. SO I HAVE SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF TIME CONSIDERING AND RESEARCHING THIS VOTE. AND I KNOW THAT WHICHEVER WAY I CAST IT, I WILL DISAPPOINT A NUMBER OF VALUED CONSTITUENTS. SO PLEASE KNOW THAT I HAVE LISTENED TO YOU. I ACKNOWLEDGE THE TRAUMA THAT MANY PEOPLE EXPERIENCE AS THEY ENVISION CULLING GOING ON IN OUR WOODLANDS. I AGREE THAT THESE WOODLANDS ARE PRECIOUS SPIRITUAL PLACES AND CRUCIAL ECOLOGICAL SYSTEMS. THEY SUPPORT BIODIVERSITY AND POLLINATORS AMONG MANY OTHER THINGS. AND FOR THAT REASON, I FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT THE NEED TO PROTECT AND STEWARD THEM. I HAVE STATED THAT I'M COMMITTED TO MAKING AN EVIDENCE-BASED DECISION ON THIS ISSUE AND FOR ME, THIS BEGINS WITH THIS QUESTION. IS DEER BROWSING THREATENING THE BIODIVERSITY, HEALTH AND SUSTAINABILITY OF OUR WOODLANDS AND WHAT WOULD I COUNT AS EVIDENCE OF THAT THREAT. FOR FOUR YEARS STARTING IN 2016, THE BOTANIST, HAS BEEN STUDYING NATURE AREAS IN ANN ARBOR, AND SOMEWHERE DEER MANAGEMENT HAS OCCURRED AND SOMEWHERE IT HAS NOT. SHE USES FRENCH DISCLOSURE THAT THE DEER BROWSING DOES TO OAK SEEDLINGS AND VARIOUS WILDFIRES AND TRILLIANS SPECIFICALLY. YOU CAN READ THOSE STUDIES ON SIT'S WEBSITE. THEY DEMONSTRATE DRAMATICALLY THAT DEER BROWSING IS HARMING THE REGENERATION OF RED OAKS IN OUR FORESTS. IT SHOWS CLEARLY BUT MODESTLY THAT DEER BROWSE DAMAGE HAS SIGNIFICANTLY DECLINED AT BIRD HILLS, BLACK POND WOODS, WHITE E OAKS AND NICHOLS ARBORETUM. AND TRILLION IS BEGINNING TO KEEP PACE WITH THAT IN FENCED AREAS. THERE'S A SIMILAR BUT MORE MODEST TREND FOR WILDFLOWER FLOWERING IN UNFENCED AREAS. SO -- AND I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT DEER-RESISTANT PLANTS, AND STARTLING DEVICES, IT KEEP DEER OUT OF A HOMEOWNER'S YARD, AND IT'S IMPRACTICAL IN CITY NATURE AREAS. I DO NOT SUPPORT THIS AMENDMENT BUT IT SHOULD GO WITHOUT SAYING AND UNFORTUNATELY I WILL ELEHAVE TOSAY IT, THAT I BELIEVE WELL-MEANING PEOPLE CAN VOTE DIFFERENTLY ON THIS ISSUE. I KNOW PEOPLE ARE WORRIED ABOUT SPENDING THIS MONEY IN THIS WAY IN A TIME OF SCARCITY BUT CONSIDER THAT THIS FUNDING REQUEST IS LESS THAN HALF THOSE OF PREVIOUS YEARS' CULLS AND CONSIDER THE EFFE EFFECTS OF SKG ANOTHER YEAR IN AND CONSIDERING THE AMOUNT THAT THE DEER REPRODUCE.
01:59:05.545: >> Councilmember Briggs: I AGREE WITH WHAT COUNCILMEMBER DISCH HAD TO SAY, BUT I CAME TO A DIFFERENT CONCLUSION. I AGREE, IS DEER GRAZING THREATENING OUR NATURAL AREAS AND CLEARLY THE DATA SHOWS THAT IT IS, AND THAT THE DEER CULL HAS BEEN HAVING -- IF YOU ARE LOOKING AT OUR IMPACT ON NATURAL AREAS, IT'S BEEN HAVING A BENEFICIAL IMPACT, BUT IT DOESN'T REACH WHEN I'M LOOKING AT THE DATA BE, THE LEVEL OF -- THAT WARRANTS IN THESE TOUGH FINANCIAL TIMES MOVING FORWARD FOR ME. WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS THAT REPORTS SAY DEER BROW LEVELS REMAIN HIGHER THAN THE BEYOND WHICH THE OAK REGENERATION IS LIKELY TO FAIL. THAT'S ALSO TRUE FOR TRILLIUM UNDER THE OAKS. ALTHOUGH WE ARE SEEING THAT IT'S HAVING A BENEFICIAL IMPACT ON THESE NATURAL AREAS, WE'RE NOT SEEING REGENERATION IN THE WAY THAT WE MIGHT HOPE AFTER MULTIPLE YEARS OF A CULL. I KNOW THAT THERE ARE OTHER PIECES, REASONS THAT FOLKS ALSO SUPPORT THE DEER CULL. SINCE I TEND TO TALK TO TRANSPORTATION PARAMOUNT, I WILL SPEAK TO VEHICLE CRASHES. WE HAVE -- WE HAVE SEEN INCREASES AND DECREASES IN CRASHES. WE MONITOR THE PEDESTRIAN/BICYCLE CRASHES. I TEND TO BELIEVE THAT WHAT WE -- THE INVESTMENTS THAT WE MAKE IN OUR INFRASTRUCTURE TO SLOW TRAFFIC WILL ALSO HAVE A TANGIBLE IMPACT ON THESE -- THESE CRASHES. SO I'M NOT GOING TO BE SUPPORTING THE CULL IN THIS BUDGET CYCLE.
02:00:52.719: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER SONG.
02:00:53.787: >> Councilmember Song: I HAVE SPOKE TONE COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND HEARD FROM A COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND LOOKED AT THE SAME REPORTS THAT COUNCILMEMBER DISCH HAS COS LOOKED AND A KEEP COMING BACK TO WHAT COUNCI COUNCILMEMBER HAYNED POINTED OUT, WE ARE WORKING WITH A STRUCTURAL DEFICIT AND WE ARE ALSO HEARING FROM SOCIAL SERVICE AGENCIES WHO ARE RUNNING -- THEY ARE STRUGGLING HOW TO BALANCE THEIR BUDGETS FOR THEIR OWN FISCAL YEAR. WITH COFU, COORDINATED FUNDING GOING BY THE WAY SIDE, EVEN WITH A YEAR'S NOTICE, WE KNOW THAT THEY WILL NOT -- THESE ARE THE HOUSING NONPROFITS, THE HOUSING ALLIANCE WHO WON'T HAVE PART OF THEIR BUDGET ON HAND. I WILL VOTING IN SUPPORT OF THIS. BUT I'M OPEN TO SAYING WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS AND THE IMPACT IT HAS. I'M OPEN TO HEARING ABOUT THIS. I JUST FEEL LIKE THIS IS A TIME WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT PANDEMIC RECOVERY AND IF WE CAN PUT OUR COMMUNITY FIRST, I HAVE AN AMENDMENT COMING UP LOOKING AT TAKING THE MONEY AND INVESTING IT IN D.E.I. WORK WHERE THAT WOULD BE PART OF, YOU KNOW LOOKING AT INSTITUTIONAL WORK THAT -- THAT REALLY NEEDS TO BE DONE IN THE CITY ON BEHALF OF PEOPLE LIVING HERE WHO CAN STILL STAY THAT LIVE HERE. SO I'M THINKING PEOPLE FIRST. AND THEN HOPEFULLY THE DAMAGE WON'T BE TOO GREAT IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS. THANKS.
02:02:34.754: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND?
02:02:36.389: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. I WAS CERTAINLY WILL BE SUPPORTING THE D.E.I. RESOLUTION DOWN THE ROAD BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT COULD TAKE A SMALL AMOUNT OF THIS AND STILL MAINTAIN THAT WILL PROTECT COUNCILS IN THE FUTURE OF HAVING TO SPEND MORE MONEY POTENTIALLY TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM. SO FOR THE SAME REASONS THAT I SUPPORTED THE CULL IN THE PAST, OFTEN WITH A HEAVY HEART AND WITH SOME RESERVATIONS, I WILL CONTINUE EVEN IF IT FAILS, BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE THAT -- THAT WHEN WE THINK ABOUT JUST WHAT'S GOOD POLICY, WHAT IS FISCALLY AND TO PRESERVE OUR NATURE AREAS. AND WHAT IS ULTIMATELY IN MY VIEW THE MOST HUMANE SOLUTION AS WELL TO TS PROBLEM. THAT KEEPING A SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY TO DO SOME MAINTENANCE, I THINK WILL SAVE SOME MONEY DOWN THE ROAD. THAT'S THE WAY I WILL BE VOTING NOW. THANKS.
02:03:45.792: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, ON AMENDMENT NUMBER THREE. STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER RADINA.

02:04:49.756: >> City Admin. Crawford: MAYOR, IF I COULD, WITH THAT REMOVED, WE WILL TRACK AS YOU GO FORWARD, AND LET YOU KNOW IF YOU HIT THE USE OF 120,000. AT THAT POINT, THERE WOULD NEED TO BE AN ADJUSTMENT TO -- TO --
02:05:02.335: >> Mayor Taylor: TO THE TEXT OF WHATEVER AMENDMENT COMES THISAFTER?
02:05:07.407: >> City Admin. Crawford: YES.
02:05:08.041: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THAT. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
02:05:10.477: >> Councilmember Hayner: WELL, THANKS, JUST TO BE EXPEDIENT, I'M GOING TO STRIKE 5, BECAUSE IT SPOKE TO THE DEER CULL. I DIDN'T REALLY LIKE THE IDEA OF A TRADEOFF. SO FIVE WILL NOT BE MOVED FORWARD. THAT'S ALL. THE OTHER ONE IS A LITTLE TOO LONG TO GO BEFORE A BREAK THAT I'M BRINGING. SO I WILL LET SOMEBODY ELSE GO.
02:05:31.731: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
02:05:32.599: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, MAYOR. I WOULD LIKE TO PUT FORTH AMENDMENT NUMBER ONE AND ALSO OFFER AN AMENDMENT TO THAT AMENDMENT.
02:05:40.473: >> Mayor Taylor: ALL RIGHT IS THERE A SECOND ON THE AMENDMENT? SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER DISCH. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
02:05:50.517: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I WOULD LIKE TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT TO $100,000 TO ALLOW FOR THE $20,000 FOR THE D.E.I. RESOLUTION THAT IS ON THIS AGENDA AS WELL.
02:06:02.762: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE A SECOND? SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER DISCH. IS THAT FRIENDLY TO THE BODY, REDUCING THE 120 TO 100? FRIENDLY TO THE BODY. COUNCIL MEMBER RAMLAWI, YOU STILL HAVE THE FLOOR. RAM THANK YOU. I KNOW THERE'S --
02:06:19.012: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. I KNOW THERE'S ANOTHER RESOLUTION BY BRIGGS BY THE CENTER OF THE CITY. I WAS IN SUPPORT OF THE DEER CULL. I DIDN'T THINK THAT IT WOULD GET TOTAL SUPPORT OF THE BODY AND THEREFORE I HAD THIS AMENDMENT DRAFTED IN THE EVENT THAT WE FIND OURSELVES HERE RIGHT NOW. WHICH IS THE DEER CULL WILL NOT GO FORWARD, AND THERE'S $120,000. WE COULD DO A LOT RIGHT NOW ON THIS BODY. WE COULD SHOW THE COMMUNITY HOW WE ARE COMING TOGETHER AND GETTING PAST OUR DIFFERENCES AND REALLY SOLVING A LOT OF THINGS WITH -- WITH ONE STONE. WE CAN GET MANY BIRDS WITH THIS STONE. AND THAT IS IT COULD END THE DEER CULL FOR NOW AT LEAST. SUPPLY MONEY TO THE CENTER OF THE CITY AND HELP FUND THE D.E.I. POSITION THAT WE'RE LOOKING TO FUND AS WELL BECAUSE THAT'S ONLY ASKING FOR 20 OF THE 120. I DON'T THINK WE ARE GOING TO BE FIXING OUR BUDGET DEFICIT WITH 120 OR $100,000. I DON'T THINK THAT, UNFORTUNATELY IT WILL BE FIX. THIS AMENDMENT WILL -- I HOPE WOULD ALLOW FOR WHAT COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS WOULD LIKE TO DO WITH -- WITH THE COUNCIL OF THE COMMONS COMMITTEE, AND OTHERS TO DO WHAT THEY WANTED TO DO AND IT IS FLEXIBLE ENOUGH TO ACCOMMODATE THOSE NEEDS AND PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL $60,000.
02:07:59.712: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS.
02:08:00.880: >> Councilmember Briggs: I APPRECIATE WHAT COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI IS HAVING TO DO. WITH HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH THE COUNCIL OF THE COMMONS AND THE CONSTITUENCY IN TERMS OF HELP TO PREPARE THE BUDGET THAT -- OR THE AMENDMENT THAT I ANTICIPATE MOVING FORWARD LATER IN THE EVENING, WITH A CHANGE THAT WOULD NOT HAVE THAT FUNDING COMING FROM THE SINGLE FAMILY ZONING MONEY AT THIS POINT BUT RATHER FROM THE DEER CULL FUNDS. BUT I THINK THERE'S A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT INTERESTS THAT WE ARE TRYING TO HAVE IN THE COMMUNITY AND I CRAFTED THAT. I THINK THERE'S A DESIRE TO -- WE CERTAINLY NEED TO MOVE FORWARD BUT WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD IN A DELIBERATE METHOD AND THE NEXT STEP SEEMS TO BE PREPARING A PRELIMINARY PLAN FOR -- AND DESIGN FOR THE CENTER OF THE CITY, AND THAT'S WHAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT TO REALLY ARTICULATE IN TERMS OF OUR NEXT STEPS AND TO ARTICULATE HOW THAT IS GOING TO BE DONE AND HOW THAT PROCESS IS GOING TO WORK AND WHO IS GOING TO BE ENGAGED IN THAT PROCESS. AND IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT IN THE WAY THAT THIS IS -- THIS -- THIS PROJECT HAS COME TO THE COMMUNITY, THAT I THINK THAT FROM THE START, AND THE EARLY STAGES THAT WE MOVE FORWARD WITH BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE DOLLARS TO SUPPORT THE NEXT PHASE OF WORK AND THAT IS WHAT MY AMENDMENT WOULD BRING FORWARD. I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO DO, BUT I THINK IT'S A LITTLE -- A LITTLE TOO BROAD FOR MY TASTE.
02:09:44.550: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
02:09:46.052: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. THE BROADNESS IS TO GIVE THE FLEXIBILITY AND APPLY THE FUNDS TO THE GREATEST EXTENT POSSIBLE AND LEAVING IT UP TO THE FOLKS ON THE COMMITTEE TO DECIDE THAT. MY QUESTION IS TO OUR CITY ADMINISTRATOR, WOULD THIS -- WOULD THESE FUNDS BE APPLIED FOR WHAT IS BEING PROPOSED IN THE -- THE BUDGET AMENDMENT, BEING PUT FORTH BY COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS? COULD IT ENCOMPASS THE WORK THAT IS BEING ASKED FOR IN THAT OTHER RESOLUTION?
02:10:24.624: >> Mayor Taylor: TO FU
02:10:28.127: >> City Admin. Crawford: TO FUND THE D.E.I. SERVICES?
02:10:30.697: >> Councilmember Ramlawi, NO THE PROFESSIONAL SERVICES FOR THE COUNCIL OF THE COMMONS.
02:10:35.702: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  SO MY AMENDMENT COULD ENCOMPASS THAT WORK AND ALLOW US AN ADDITIONAL $60,000 FOR TOILETRY OR SANITARY STATIONS OR SOMETHING ELSE OR ANYTHING ELSE THAT'S -- THAT THEY COULD SEE FIT, I THINK I WOULD LIKE TO LEAVE IT TO THOSE FOLKS WHO ARE WORKING ON THAT.
02:11:01.961: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND. YOU ARE MUTED.
02:11:05.098: >> Councilmember Grand: YES. THANK YOU. I FIGURED IT OUT. I WON'T BE SUPPORTING THIS AMENDMENT. I THINK IT'S NOT ONLY OVERLY BROAD BUT IF WE ARE GOING TO BE MAKING ARGUMENTS ABOUT NOT SPENDING SMALL AMOUNTS OF MONEY FOR CERTAIN USES, I THINK IT'S CRITICALLY, CRITICALELY IMPORTANT THAT ANY MONEY THAT GOES TO THIS EFFORT IS IN RESPONSE TO A SPECIFIC ASK FROM THE GROUP AND THAT THEY CLEARLY SHOW US WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO DO WITH THE MONEY AND EXPLAIN WHY IT'S NEEDED. WE -- YOU KNOW, WE SHOULDN'T JUST BE HANDING OUT BLANK CHECKS TO A GROUP WITHOUT TELLING US WHY THEY -- WHY THEY NEED IT. I THINK WE HOLD OUR STAFF TO THAT LEVEL OF ACCOUNTABILITY IN OUR BUDGETING AND I WOULD EXPECT THE SAME FOR THIS TYPE OF EFFORT. SO I WILL BE VOTING NO.
02:12:02.255: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THIS AMENDMENT? MR. HAYNER.
02:12:12.231: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WILL SUPPORT THIS. BECAUSE THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME MONEY GOING OVER NO THIS PROJECT AND I ALSO WOULD BE SUPPORTIVE OF COUNCILWOMAN BRIGGS' AMENDMENT. THE ONE THING I -- I KNOW WE'RE SPEAKING TO THIS BUT I LIKE THIS ONE BETTER BECAUSE IT DOESN'T LOCK IN THE FUNDING AND I THINK WE KNOW THAT THERE'S -- THERE HAS -- IT'S GOING TO BE A NEED FOR BOTH THE PLANNING, WHICH IS DULY RECOGNIZED IN COUNCILWOMAN BRIGGS' AMENDMENT, BUT ALSO SOME, YOU KNOW, KIND OF ACTIONABLE DOLLARS, YOU MIGHT SAY AS THE COUNCIL OF THE COMMONS COMES UP WITH NEEDS. THEY HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED IN THE TASK FORCE AND AT THE MEETINGS AND SO ON. SO I LIKE THIS BECAUSE IT'S A LITTLE MORE OPEN. I THINK IT WOULD BE FULLY APPROPRIATE TO GET MONIES OVER TO THEM SOMEHOW. SO I WILL SUPPORT THIS ONE AND IF THIS DOESN'T PASS, I WILL MOST LIKELY SUPPORT THE OTHER TWO. THANK YOU.
02:13:04.584: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RADINA.
02:13:07.453: >> Councilmember Radina: THANK YOU, I WILL BE RELATIVELY BRIEF HERE. I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING THIS AMENDMENT. I WILL LIKELY SUPPORT THE AMENDMENT LATER ON THAT IS A SMALLER AMOUNT, SIMPLY BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE THINGS WE HAVE HEARD ARTICULATED WITH PREVIOUS AMENAMENDMENTS WE AS A CITY ARE FACING, LARGE STRUCTURAL DEFICIT. I THINK EVERY DOLLAR DOES MATTER HERE AND SO I THINK TO COUNCILMEMBER GRAND'S POINT, I F WE ARE GOING TO ALLOCATE MONEY, I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT WE ARE ALLOCATING. I DON'T WANT TO GIVE INRESTRICTED DOLLARS TO A COMMISSION. I WOULD LIKE FOR IT TO BE CONTROLLED BY THIS BOYD AND ALLOCATE THAT -- BY THIS BODY AND ALLOCATE THAT MONEY IN THE FUTURE.
02:13:57.036: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS.
02:13:58.237: >> Councilmember Briggs: I JUST WANTED TO MAYBE LET FOLKS KNOW, IT MAY BE AS OUR -- AS THE COUNCIL OF THE COMMONS DOES WORK AND WE IDENTIFY NEXT STEPS, YOU MAY SEE ME COME BACK WITH A BUDGET AMENDMENT AT SOME POINT IN THE YEAR OR MAYBE, YOU KNOW, SOMETIME BUT RIGHT NOW WE DON'T HAVE AN ARTICULATED EVEN SHORT-TERM, MID-TERM OR LONG-TERM WORK ARTICULATED BY THE COMMISSION YET AND SO THAT' THE FOCUS OF OUR NEXT COMMITTEE. WE ARE OBVIOUSLY WORKING OFF THE TASK FORCE REPORT. ONE THE CLEAR RECOMMENDATIONS IS A DESIGN IS A STEP THAT SHOULD BE TAKEN. I FEEL COMFORTABLE THAT THAT IS WORK THAT THE COMMITTEE SHOULD BE WORKING ON AND IT WILL BE A PRIORITY THAT COMES OUT OF THE GROUP BUT I THINK IN TERMS OF OTHER NEEDS, IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE STAY CONSISTENT ON THE COMMISSIONS AND IN TERMS OF HOW THE BUDGETS WORK.
02:14:59.131: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, I HAVE YOU SPOKEN TWICE ON THIS MATTER, AM. I INCORRECT?
02:15:03.603: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  YOU ARE POSSIBLY CORRECT, PROBABLY CORRECT. I HAD A REBUTTAL. BUT I DON'T WANT TO VIOLATE RULES AND BECOME UNBECOMING. SO I WON'T SAY ANYTHING.
02:15:16.916: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER SONG.
02:15:20.319: >> Councilmember Song: COUNCILME MBER RAMLAWI AND I HAD A LONG AND HEATED DISCUSSION, BUT I THINK WE -- WE CAME TO A CERTAIN UNDERSTANDING. I WAS VERY FRANK AND SAID I WOULDN'T BE SUPPORTIVE OF THIS IF WE TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT WE HAVE DONE WITH OTHER PARK INITIATIVES, SKATEPARK, FOR EXAMPLE, THE ACCESSIBLE PARK FUNDED BY ROTARY CLUB. IT WASN'T SEEDED WITH GENERAL FUNDS, BUT ACTUALLY HAD PRIVATE DONORS COME FORWARD WITH MATCHING GRANTS AND DEDICATED TO ACTUALLY COMING UP WITH THE MONEY BEFOREHAND FROM EVERYTHING FROM KIDS SELLING -- WORKING AT BAKE SALES, SELLING BRICKS AT I WOULD LOVE TO SHIS TYP OFSERS ENTHUSIASM, GIVEN THAT THIS IS -- THIS WAS A MANDATE SUPPORTED BY THOUSANDS MORE VOTERS THAN WHO WERE, YOU KNOW, SUPPORTIVE OF THE SKATEPARK. PHILANTHROPY IS A DIFFICULT THING, ESPECIALLY DURING A PANDEMIC. I WISH THEM LUCK, I WANT TO POINT TO THE COFU AND THE SOCIAL SERVICE IMPACT. I DON'T BELIEVE WE GIVE 100K TO -- AS AN INDIVIDUAL GRANT TO A PARTICULAR NONPROFIT. SO A NONPROFIT THAT PROVIDES DIRECT SERVICES TO OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS. CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG. SOMEONE ON STAFFER, IF YOU CAN REMEMBER THE AVERAGE COFU GRANT, THEN PLEASE LET ME KNOW. THANKS.
02:16:57.016: >> Mayor Taylor: FOR MY PART, I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING THIS'LL AND I EXPECT TO SUPPORT THE -- THE MORE TARGETED AMENDMENT. FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE AMENDMENT? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER RADINA.

02:29:07.946: >> City Admin. Crawford: MAYOR, WE HAD A QUESTION ABOUT THIS AMENDMENT IF WE COULD HAVE STAFF RESPOND TO THAT.
02:29:15.720: >> City Admin. Crawford: MS. PRA SCHAN HAS A RESPONSE. I CAN PROMPT THE QUESTION IF NEEDED MARTI.
02:29:23.995: >> YES, PLEASE.
02:29:25.230: >> City Admin. Crawford: THE QUESTION WAS PROPOSED D.E.I. AS ONE FTE TO WHAT EXTENT WILL THIS INCREASE THE CITY'S STRUCTURAL BUDGET DEFICIT?
02:29:47.252: >> IT DOES DOESN'T AFFECT THE GL FUN AND THE 50% FOR THE GENERAL FUN SHARE HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS REDUCTIONS AS ITEMIZED IN THE AMENDMENT.
02:30:07.038: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THAT ALL MR. CRAWFORD.
02:30:11.476: >> Councilmember Radina: WHILE ANN ARBOR IS ONE MOST HIGHLY EDUCATION AND HEALTHY AND ECONOMICAL PROSPEROUS, WE KNOW THAT COMMUNITIES THE COLOR HAVE NOT SHARED IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH AND EDUCATIONAL AND JOB GROWTH. OUR REGION IS ONE THE WORST IN THE NATION IN ECONOMIC SEGREGATION AND INCOME EQUALITY. WE HAVE DRAMATIC DISPARITIES WENT WHITE RESIDENTS AND RESIDENTS OF COLORS AND THERE'S A WAGE GAP. THESE CAN BE DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTED TO SYSTEMIC INEQUITY IN POLICY AND DECISION MAKING IN OUR HISTORY IF ANN ARBOR RESIDENTS VALUE DIVERSITY, I BELIEVE WE MUST INVEST IN EQUITY. IF WE ARE COMMITTED TO BECOMING AN EQUITY AND AANTIRACIST, WE NEED SOMEONE LEADING THIS EFFORT, DAY IN AND DAY OUT. I'M MOVING THIS AMENDMENT BECAUSE I BELIEVE WE NEED A DEDICATED STAFF PERSON TO HELP US DEVELOP AND ENACT A PLAN TO INCORPORATE EQUITY INTO OUR COMMUNITY SERVICES INTO THE PROGRAMS THAT WE OFFER, AND INTO OUR HIRING PRACTICES AND OUR INTERACTION WITH THE PUBLIC AND THE COMMUNITY PARTNERS. I WANT TO MAKE SURE I THANK THE STAFF WHO WORKED WITH US ON. THERE WERE SEVERAL CONVERSATIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE MOVING TO THE RIGHT PLACE. I WANT TO THANK MR. CRAWFORD FOR RETHINKING HIS POSITION. AND HE THOUGHT ABOUT HOW IT WOULDING COINMENTED INTO THE WORK THAT THEY ARE ALREADY DOING THE AND OF STAFF THAT ARE INCORPORATING INTO THEIR EVERYDAY FUNCTION. I WANT TO THANK OUR OFFICE OF SUSTAINABILITY STAFF. THEY ACTUALLY OFFERED MONEY THEY IDENTIFIED MONEY AND OFFERED IT FORWARD TO HELP OFFSET SOME OF THIS COST. BECAUSE THEY FELT THAT IT WAS SO IMPORTANT TO THEIR WORK. I HOPE THIS HAS THE SUPPORT OF THE GROUP AND I THANK COUNCILMEMBER SONG AND MAYOR MAR TAYLOR FOR WORKING WITH ME ON. THIS.
02:32:26.244: >> Councilmember Song: IT'S LIKE THE OSCARS. THERE'S D.E. I. OFFICERS IN MINNEAPOLIS, KALAMAZOO, AND I WANTED TO DO A SHOT OUT OF WESTERVILLE, OHIO, POPULATION OF 40,000. AND THEY HAVE A JOB DESCRIPTION. FOR FOLKS WHO ARE UNFAMILIAR WITH THIS AND HOW IT DIFFERS FROM INTERNAL H. R. WORK. DIVERSITY AND EQUITY INCLUSION, LOOKS LIKE A WAY TO PROMOTE AN ENVIRONMENT OF GENDER, GENERATIONAL, RACIAL, RELIGIOUS AND ETHNIC DIVERSITY TO POSITION THEM AS A LEADING COMMUNITY OF INCLUSION IN CENTRAL OHIO. SO I THINK -- I THINK WEEK MEET THAT CHALLENGE, CENTRAL, OHIO. I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT WE CAN -- WESTERVILLE CONTINUES TO SAY THAT THIS WORK RUNS THE TALENTS, SKILLS AND ABILITIES AMONG ITS WORKFORCE, INCLUDING THOUGHTFUL ANALYSIS AND INTERNAL POLICIES ALONG WITH BUILDING ALLIANCES WITH EXTERNAL ORGANIZATIONS CONFRONTING RACISM. SO WE HAVE THE BONES OF THIS WORK ALREADY HERE AT THE COUNTY LEVEL WITH THEIR EQUITY OFFICE WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE H COUNTY COMMISSIONERS WRITING IN IN SUPPORT OF THEIR OWN EXPERTISE AND WHAT THEY HAVE LEARNED IN THE PAST THREE YEARS SINCE THEY CREATED THIS OFFICE. WE HAVE SUPPORTERS OF THE U OF M INNSBRUCK. I HOPE WE CAN VOTE IN THIS UNANIMOUSLY AND PUSH IT AS AN INVESTMENT TOWARDS ONGOING ACTIVE COMMUNITY COLLABORATIONS. WE CAN STRENGTHEN THE RELATIONSHIP, AGAIN OBSERVING HOLIDAYS, AND YOU WILL NOTE THAT A LOT OF THIS D.E.I. WORK IS COMING OUT ON THE HEELS OF CITIES BATTLING WITH ISSUES RELATED TO PLACING AND HOUSING. SO THIS IS OUTWARD FACING. THIS IS LONG TERM. AND IT'S INCLUSIONAL. SO I -- AND IT'S INSTITUTIONAL. I HOPE FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANKS.
02:34:31.836: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
02:34:33.004: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I DEFINITELY SUPPORT THE GOALS. I WONDER IF THIS IS ENOUGH MONEY TO ACTUALLY HIRE SOMEONE WHO IS GOING TO STAY WITH THE CITY AND BE ABLE TO DO THE WORK THAT IS NEEDED. I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM MR. CRAWFORD ON. THIS.
02:34:53.491: >> City Admin. Crawford: AS I THOUGHT ABOUT THIS POSITION AND TALKED TO THE STAFF ABOUT IT AND THE COUNCILMEMBERS WHO WANTED TO DISCUSS IT, YOU KNOW, THE LEVEL OF HIRE THAT YOU CAN GET CAN VARY A GREAT DEAL, WHETHER IT IS SOMEONE JUST NEW IN THE BUSINESS, SOME EXPERIENCE, EXECUTIVE EXPERIENCE, AND WE THOUGHT TO HIT FOR THE MARK HERE, WE WANT TO FIND SOMEONE WHO IS EXPERIENCE AND CAN BE THE PERSON WHO WALKS IN THE ROOM AND IS RECOGNIZED AS THE CITY'S EQUITY OFFICER OR PERSON, AND YET BE ON THE ROUTE TO AN EXECUTIVE POSITION, AT HIGHER PAY, AS THE N NEXT MOVE.
02:35:43.875: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I GUESS WITH THAT SAID, I WILL SUPPORT THIS BUT I WOULD ALSO SUPPORT A BUDGET AMENDMENT DURING THE YEAR IF IT TURNS OUT THAT THIS IS NOT AN ADEQUATE SUM TO GET THE JOB DONE. SO THANK YOU.
02:36:05.296: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS TO THE FLOOR AND THE STAFF WORKING ON THIS EARLIER. THOSE ARE THE FOLKS WHO HELP US TREMENDOUSLY TO ACCEPT OUR -- OUR OSCARS. I WILL WHETHER $146,000 WOULD BE ENOUGH AGAIN. WHAT ARE WE GOING TO GET? HOW DO WE -- HOW DO WE ESTABLISH THAT? HOW DO WE DETERMINE THAT SINCE THIS IS AN EMERGING FIELD? HOW DO WE GET TO THAT NUMBER? 40 HOW DO WE KNOW THAT THAT'S WHAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE TO FILL THIS? AND THEN WILL WE LOOK AT OTHER SOURCES OF FUNDING IN THE YEARS FOLLOWING THIS? FROM MY UNDERSTANDING A LOT OF THESE ARE FUNDED THROUGH GRANTS AND OTHER OPPORTUNITIES, AND WOULD, PERHAPS, LIKE, YOU KNOW, THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN, WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS A LOT OF MONEY. HOW DO WE GET TO 146?
02:37:15.300: >> City Admin. Crawford: WE MADE AN ESTIMATE AND WE WILL HAVE TO SEE WHERE THE TALENT AND THE MARK GOES. AND IF WE HAVE TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS FROM THERE. WE HAVE NOT -- AS A STRUCTURAL CHANGE TO THE ORGANIZATION, WE MIGHT PURSUE GRANTS FOR, YOU KNOW, TO OFFSET TEMPORARILY, BUT THAT WOULD NOT BE SOMETHING WE WANT TO DO -- WELL, WE DON'T THINK IT'S FEASIBLE LONG TERM. SO WE NEED TO PLAN TO HAVE THIS PERMANENTLY AS A RECURRING COST. SO AMERICAN RESCUE FUND IS TEMPORARY.
02:37:52.570: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  THE DEER CULL WAS A TEMPORARY PROGRAM AND IT WAS GOING INTO THE SIX YEAR D.. DID WE HAVE DEER FUND IN YEAR 25, 26? WE ARE TALKING ABOUT STRUCTURAL, YOU KNOW, CHANGING SOMETHING STRUCTURALLY HERE WITH THIS POSITION. DID WE HAVE DEER CULL --
02:38:17.095: >> City Admin. Crawford: IT WAS A RECURRING EXPENDITURE.
02:38:19.731: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU.
02:38:30.441: >> Mayor Taylor: I WOULD LIKE TO ECHO THE THANKS TO STAFF AND CITY MANAGER CRAWFORD FOR ENGAGING WITH COUNCILMEMBER RADINA, SONG AND MYSELF. I THINK THIS IS INSUFFICIENT IN THE END BUT NECESSARY -- INSUFFICIENT IN TOTAL, OF COURSE AND NOT AN END IN AND OF ITSELF BUT A NECESSARY CONDITION FOR US TO MOVE FORWARD, THE NECESSARY CONDITION FOR US TO MOVE FORWARD WITH SPEED AS AN ORGANIZATION, FOR US TO MOVE FORWARD WITH SPEED AS A COMMUNITY. WE AS A MUNICIPAL ORGANIZATION HAVE A -- A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY IN PROMOTING EQUITY THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY AND WE NEED A CHAMPION INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL TO DO IT. I'M DELIGHTED THIS IS MOVING FORWARD BECAUSE THIS EFFORT IS FUNDAMENTAL TO THE COMMUNITY VALUES AND WHAT WE WANT TO BE AS AN ORGANIZATION IN THE COMMUNITY. FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? OPPOSED? APPROVED. FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN MOTION AS AMENDED. COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS.
02:39:55.359: >> Councilmember Briggs: YEAH. I WOULD LIKE TO OFFER AMENDMENT NUMBER 7. I DON'T KNOW IF I -- THANK YOU.
02:40:05.103: >> Mayor Taylor: SECONDED BY COUNCICOUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
02:40:16.681: >> City Admin. Crawford: THERE WAS A QUESTION THAT CAME IN ON THIS ITEM. COULD WE LIKE TO HAVE THAT RESPONDED TO NOW?
02:40:24.355: >> Councilmember Briggs: YES.
02:40:24.989: >> Mayor Taylor: LET'S ROLL WITH
02:40:26.424: >> City Admin. Crawford: MR. DEL AMR. DELACOURT IS HERE.
02:40:33.131: >> THE QUESTION IS IF THE $100,000 AMOUNT FOR THE SINGLE FAMILY ZONING WAS REDUCED BY 40%, WHAT IMPACT IT WOULD HAVE ON THE PROCESS. I THINK THE EASIEST WAY TO PUT THAT OTHER THAN JUST SAY 40%, WOULD BE TO SAY WE WOULD -- IT WOULD BE A MUCH LESS IN PERSON PROGRAM. WE WOULD HAVE TO DO MORE SOCIAL MEDIA AND WEBSITE TYPE WORK, RATHER THAN IN-PERSON COMMUNICATION WITH THE RESIDENTS AND I THINK -- WE DON'T HAVE A DETAILEDROGR PUT TOGETHER ON IS. ENGAMENT WOR OHISND WETY ULD HAVE AN ESTIME OF WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO GET OUT AND HAVE COMMUN COMMUNICATIONS WITHE COMMUNITY. WE WOULD LIMIT THE OUTSIDE EXPERTS TO BRING IN PROFESSIONALS DEPENDING ON WHERE THE CONVERSATION GOES IN THE COMMUNITY. WE EXPECT THIS CONVERSATION COULD GO DIFFERENTLY DEPENDING ON WHAT AREAS OF THE CITY. WE NEED OUTSIDE PERSONNEL TO COME IN. IN SHORT THAT'S BEST ANSWER I HAVE AT THIS POINT.
02:41:56.314: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS, YOU HAVE
02:41:58.182: >> Councilmember Briggs: CERTAIN LY MY INTENT IN TERMS OF DOING THIS WAS NEVER TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE CONVERSATION. AND SINCE WE NOW HAVE ADDITIONAL IDENTIFIED FUNDING THAT WE COULD USE FROM THE GENERAL FUND RESERVES SINCE WE HAVE -- WE ARE NO LONGER DOING THE DEER CULL, I WOULD LIKE TO -- I DON'T KNOW IF IT WOULD BE FRIENDLY -- I'M NOT QUITE SURE OF THE PROCESS, IS IT FRIENDLY TO THE BODY IF IF I DOCTOR.
02:42:30.481: >> Mayor Taylor: OFFER THE AMENDMENT. AND THEN WE'LL SEE IF IT'S FRIENDLY.
02:42:34.252: >> Councilmember Briggs: SO INSTEAD OF THE REDUCING THIS BY $40,000, IT WOULD BE SIMPLY -- IT WOULD BE, I GUESS, UTILIZING GENERAL FUND RESERVES IN THE AMOUNT OF $40,000.
02:42:50.935: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THAT THE PROPER NOMENCLATURE.
02:42:55.106: >> City Admin. Crawford: YES.
02:42:55.740: >> Mayor Taylor: SECONDED TO COUNCILMEMBER RADINA. IS THAT FRIENDLY TO THE BODY. DOES ANYBODY HAVE ANY OBJECTION TO THAT? PLEASE RAISE YOUR HAND. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, ARE YOU OBJECTING TO THAT?
02:43:07.485: >> Councilmember Hayner:  IS THE RESULT THAT IF THIS AMENDMENT MOVES FORWARD, THEN IT WILL BE MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE $100,000 WILL STAY IN THE BUDGET FOR THE SINGLE FAMILY ZONING CONVERSATION?
02:43:23.601: >> Mayor Taylor: THAT'S CORRECT.
02:43:25.236: >> Councilmember Hayner:  AND WE WON'T TAKE THAT MONEY FROM ELSEWHERE?
02:43:28.339: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THAT FRIENDLY TO THE BODY.
02:43:30.308: >> Clerk Beaudry: MAYOR, CAN YOU CLARIFY WHAT WE'RE CHANGING?
02:43:35.146: >> Mayor Taylor: THE AMENDMENT AFFECTS A TRANSFER AS WRITTEN FROM, IF YOU WILL, THE SINGLE FAMILY ZONING PROJECT -- THE SINGLE FAMILY ZONING COMMUNITY INGAENGAGEMENT PROJECT. THE FROM IS NOW ALTERED. THE FROM IS NOW GENERAL FUND RESERVES. A/K/A, 120,000 FROM THAT POOL LEFT OPEN BY THE DEER CULL REDUCTION. SO NOW THE SINGLE FAMILY ENGAGEMENT COMMUNITY IS NOT TOUCHED BY THIS AMENDMENT AND INSTEAD -- INSTEAD $40,000 OF THE $120,000 IS ALLOCATED FOR THE PURPOSES ARTICULATED. COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGSS. THATCOUNT
02:44:34.605: >> Councilmember Briggs: CORRECT
02:44:36.741: >> Mayor Taylor: MS. BEAUDRY, IS THAT CORRECT?
02:44:39.276: >> Clerk Beaudry: YES, YOU ARE STRIKING THE ONE-TIME FUNDING FOR SINGLE FAMILY ZONING IN THE
02:44:45.416: >> City Admin. Crawford: REPLACI NG IT WITH UTILIZING GENERAL FUND RESERVES.
02:44:50.654: >> Clerk Beaudry: THANK YOU.
02:45:01.699: >> Mayor Taylor: WAY BETTER THAN I WHAT I SAID.
02:45:06.170: >> Councilmember Briggs: I SPOKE TO THIS WITH AMENDMENT ONE. I DON'T WANT TO REPEAT THIS TOO MUCH. THE POINT IS TO -- THE $40,000 WOULD BE USED -- ALLOCATED FOR CREATING A CONCEPTUAL PRELIMINARY FISCAL PLAN FOR THE CENTER OF THE BLOCK. THAT'S A RECOMMENDATION FROM THE TASK FORCE REPORT, STAFF WOULD UTILIZE THAT, AND USING OTHER FUNDS SUCH AS PHILANTHROPIC EFFORTS TO COMPLIMENT THIS EFFORT.
02:45:44.408: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
02:45:45.342: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WOULD LIKE TO BE LISTED AS A COSPONSOR IF THAT IS POSSIBLE. IS THAT SOMETHING THAT'S DONE WITH BUDGET AMENDMENTS? GIVEN THAT I WAS PREVIOUSLY QUOTED IN MLIVE AS SUPPORTING THIS CONCEPT. SO I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO CREATE ANY CONFUSION.
02:46:05.129: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
02:46:05.996: >> Councilmember Hayner: YEAH, WELL THANKS, MR. MAYOR. I WILL SUPPORT THIS MONEY GOING OVER TO CENTER OF THE CITY. I THINK THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT BE CONSIDERED WHEN WE -- IF WE DO HIRE PROFESSIONAL STAFF OR ENGINEERING STAFF OR WHATEVER, THE THIRD PARTY TO DO THIS WORK, YOU KNOW, I THINK WE WANT TO -- I WOULD MAKE THE ASSUMPTION HERE THAT IT GOES THROUGH A BID PROCESS, LIKE ANYTHING ELSE WOULD FOR A CITY VENDOR. QUALIFYING BIDDERS. I DON'T THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE SAID. I MEAN, WE HAVE KIND OF A STRANGE SITUATION HERE WHERE WE HAVE CITY BUSINESS AND NOT CITY BUSINESS, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE THE COMMONS. BUT -- SO HOPEFULLY THAT GOES WITHOUT SAYING AS WE GO THROUGH THE BID PROCESS. AND SECONDLY, -- I MEAN, I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO TAKE THIS MONEY FROM THE GENERAL FUND AND YUMMY THEN WAS EVEN MORE EASIER TO PROVIDE FOR THE SERVICE -- GU[ GUITAR STRUMMING ]
02:47:12.696: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS. WHETHER IT'S ME OR WHAT. I APPRECIATE COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS BRINGING THAT FORWARD. I WOULDN'T MIND SPONSORING IT AS WELL. SO IF YOU COULD ADD ME AS A SPONSOR, I WILL SUPPORT THIS. AND THEN HOPEFULLY THIS WILL GIVE US THE MATCHING MONEY OR THE IMPETUS THAT WE NEED TO, YOU KNOW, GET SOME MORE FUND-RAISING GOING SO IF THEY COME UP AND THEY SAY, HEY, STAGE ONE IS PICNIC TABLES OR WHATEVER. THAT'S THE THING, WE REALLY JUST WANT TO GET THIS SPACE TO BECOME MORE OF A PUBLIC SPACE AND A GATHERING SPACE AND SO, YOU KNOW IF THIS MOVES IN THAT DIRECTION, THEN I'M ALL FOR IT.
02:47:56.073: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
02:47:56.941: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS BRINGING THIS FORWARD. OBVIOUSLY, I HAD HOPED TO SEE MORE MONEY ACT PLIED TOWARDS THIS SO THAT WE COULD HAVE SOME OF THOSE OTHER IMPROVEMENTS THAT MY COLLEAGUE JUST SPOKE ON, AND IT WASN'T JUST LIMITED TO THIS. I WILL PUSH BACK ON THE ASSERTION THAT MY RESOLUTION WAS NOT ASCRIBED WELL ENOUGH. IT ALLOWED THE COUNCIL OF THE COMMONS, THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN IN THE WORKINGS OF EVERYTHING TO COME BACK TO COUNCIL AND RECOMMEND WHAT THEY WOULD DO WITH THIS MONEY. WE WERE NOT JUST BRINGING THEM A BLANK CREDIT. I THINK WE SHOULD GIVE THE PEOPLE WHO SERVE THE CITY A MORE CREDIT. THEY COULD COME BACK AND OFFER THEIR SUGGESTIONS ON WHERE THAT MONEY WOULD GO. AND WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT $60,000ND I GUARANTEE YOU, IN THE NEXT 52 WEEKS WE ARE GOING TO FIND PLENTY OF WAYS TO BLOW $60,000 ON THINGS. SO I WILL REMEMBER THESE COMMENTS BEING MADE HERE ABOUT THE STRUCTURAL DEFICIT AND THE SENSITIVITY WHEN IT COMES TO SPENDING OUR DOLLARS, WHICH I WILL RESPECT BUT I HOPE THAT WE'RE CONSISTENT WITH THAT LINE OF THINKING:  AGAIN, I APPRECIATE THIS. WE ALREADY HEARD FROM THE SPONSOR THAT MOST LIKELY IT WILY WILL BE COMING BACK FOR MORE MONEY FOR OTHER THINGS AND I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE OUR FOLKS A LITTLE BIT OF BREATHING ROOM AND SPACE, AND THAT MEANS SOME CASH. I DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO STATE THAT EARLIER AND I WOULD LIKE TO STATE IT NOW THAT I HOPE WE CAN FOLLOW UP THIS WITH ADDITIONAL FUNDING THAT MAY NEED TO BE REQUIRED IN ORDER TO EXECUTE AND GET A WORKABLE FINISHED PRODUCT TO AT LEAST A CERTAIN STAGE. BUT THIS IS -- IF THIS PASSES, THIS IS A MILESTONE. THIS IS A BREAKTHROUGH. WE HAVE HEARD MANY MEMBERS SAY THAT THEY WOULD NEVER SUPPORT A DOLLAR FROM THE GENERAL FUND TO GO TOWARDS THIS. AND IF THIS HAPPENS TONIGHT, IT -- THAT WILL BE -- THAT WILL BE GOOD ENOUGH AND MUCH, MUCH APPRECIATED. THANK YOU.
02:50:30.427: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
02:50:32.129: >> Councilmember Grand: I DO APPRECIATE COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS' EFFORTS. I HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH HER. WE HAVE GONE BACK AND FORTH. AND ULTIMATELY -- AND I THINK SHE WILL UNDERSTAND WHY, I WILL NEVER SUPPORT A DOLLAR FROM THE GENERAL FUND, UNTIL THERE'S MONEY RAISED PRIVATELY. I DO APPRECIATE THOSE EFFORTS. I CAN'T IN GOOD CONSCIOUS, HAVING LIVED THROUGH THIS AND CONTINUING TO SEE, YOU KNOW, -- ASKING FOR FUNDS WITHOUT COMING FORWARD WITHOUT RAISING OF PRIVATE DOLLARS, SUPPORT ANY MONEY FROM THE GENERAL -- YOU KNOW FROM THE GENERAL FUND. IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH STRUCTURAL DEFICITS. IT REALLY IS THAT PHILOSOPHICALLY, I THINK WE HAVE HAD OTHER GROUPS THAT HAVE -- LIKE THE SKATEPARK, WHO SHOWED US THE WAY FORWARD IF WE WANT SOMETHING, THAT'S IN ADDITION TO WHAT WE HAVE, -- YOU KNOW, I'M TRYING -- IT'S REALLY HARD NOT TO BE INFLAMMATORY ABOUT THIS, KNOWING THE HISTORY OF IT. BUT -- SORRY. I WILL JUST END THERE AND THAT I REALLY DO APPRECIATE MEMBER BRIGGS IS TRYING TO DO HERE. BUT I CAN'T IN GOOD CONSCIOUS SUPPORT IT.
02:52:02.719: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
02:52:03.620: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES, I HAVE A CLARIFYING QUESTION. I THOUGHT THE $40,000 WAS SELECTED BECAUSE THAT'S THE AMOUNT THAT'S BEEN RAISED PRIVATELY TO DATE. IS THAT CORRECT? I DON'T KNOW, COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS, MAYBE YOU KNOW, SINCE YOU ARE ON THE COMMITTEE?
02:52:29.480: >> Councilmember Briggs: MAYOR TAYLOR, IS IT OKAY IF I RESPOND TO THAT?
02:52:32.883: >> Mayor Taylor: YES, THANK YOU. YES, THAT WAS ACTUALLY WHY THAT NUMBER WAS SELECTED, BECAUSE THAT WAS -- THAT WAS THE AMOUNT OF FUNDS THAT WERE RAISED BY THE CONSERVANCY. I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK FOR ANOTHER NONPROFIT AND THE COMMUNITY IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH THEY WOULD ALLOCATE TOWARDS THIS EFFORT. I WOULD SAY THAT $40,000, BASED ON THE ESTIMATES THAT I HAVE RECEIVED FROM STAFF, IS NOT LIKELY TO BE ENOUGH TO FUND THE PRELIMINARY DESIGN WORK AND SO I'M -- MY ESTIMATE THAT I'M RUNNING WITH RIGHT NOW IS AROUND $70,000. SO I WOULD ANTICIPATE THAT THAT WOULD REQUIRE A SIGNIFICANT PRIVAT MATCHING FUNDS TO BE ABLE TO MOVE THIS ENDEAVOR FORWARD.
02:53:17.027: >> Councilmember Griswold: THANKS.
02:53:18.996: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS, YOU WERE IN THE QUEUE PRIOR TO THAT.
02:53:25.636: >> Councilmember Briggs: I WAS JUST GOING TO STATE EXACTLY WHAT COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD ASKED ME.
02:53:32.976: >> Mayor Taylor: FAIR POINT. COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
02:53:35.546: >> Councilmember Nelson: SORRY, IT TOOK ME A WHILE FOR ME TO UNMUTE. I WANT TO THANK COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS FOR CLARIFYING THAT FACTUAL INFORMATION. I HA CLARIFY QUESTIONING, IN TERMS  THE FRIDL AMEMENT THAT WEADE, I -- WE -- WHERE WE'RE AT IN THE DEER CULL MONEY THAT'S LEFT, WE STILL HAVE THE $20,000 THAT WENT TO THE D.E.I. POSITION, RIGHT? I JUST WANTED TO -- I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE WE UNDERSTOOD THAT, BECAUSE IT'S NOT -- IT'S NOT 40 FROM THE 120. IT'S ACTUALLY 40 FROM THE 100 REMAINING.
02:54:13.750: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU FOR THE CORRECTION.
02:54:15.152: >> Councilmember Nelson: THANKS. DID EVERYBODY TRACK THAT? BOTTOM LINE IS WHEN I SAID 40 FROM THE 120, THAT WAS A MISTAKE. IT WAS 40 FROM THE 100. FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? OPPOSED? I'M SORRY. LET'S -- ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER RADINA.
02:54:55.559: >> Councilmember Radina: YES.
02:54:57.394: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
02:54:58.595: >> Councilmember Eyer: NO.
02:54:59.763: >> Councilmember Nelson:  YES.
02:55:07.371: >> Councilmember Briggs: YES.
02:55:08.005: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES.
02:55:09.172: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES.
02:55:15.245: >> Councilmember Disch: YES.
02:55:15.846: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES.
02:55:19.616: >> Councilmember Song: NO.
02:55:25.522: >> Councilmember Grand: NO.
02:55:26.123: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION CARRIES.
02:55:27.624: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN MOTION AS AMENDED? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
02:55:37.067: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANKS, MR. MAYOR. I'M FLIPPING OVER HERE TO MY SCREEN THAT I CAN ACTUALLY READ. BEAR WITH ME. I WANT TO MOVE AN AMENDMENT, AND IT IS -- IT'S KIND OF OUT OF -- IT'S -- IT'S AMENDMENT NUMBER FOUR. AND I JUST WANT TO MOVE AMENDMENT NUMBER FOUR.
02:56:06.096: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE A SECOND? SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
02:56:12.536: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU. AND THANK YOU FOR THE SECOND. I JUST WANT TO CLEAR UP WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT. SO WHEN I STARTED -- THERE ARE SEVERAL WAYS TO BALANCE A BUDGET OR REDUCE A BUDGET OR HEAL A STRUCTURAL DEFICIT. I THE ONE IS TO CUT FUNDING, AND I WHOLLY SUPPORT THE WORK THAT O.S.I. DOING THAT THEY ARE DOING ON OUR A2ZERO PLAN AND I NO WE HAD A LOT OF SUCCESS, SOME OF WHICH WERE VOLUNTEERS WHO BECAME HIRES AND WHAT A GREAT WAY TO FIND OUT IF SOMEBODY IS A GOOD FELT FIT FOR THE SYSTEM. I'M EXCITED ABOUT THAT. I WAS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE -- FOR GOOD OR ILL, I WAS ONE THE PEOPLE WHO SUPPORTED MOVING IT FORWARD, MAKING IT MORE AGGRESSIVE IN 2025, INSTEAD OF 2030. AND, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE WE WERE NOT SURE IF THE UNIVERSITY WAS GOING TO BE ON BOARD AND SO ON. SO THAT MADE IT EVEN THAT MUCH MORE OF A CHALLENGE. AND SO THE NOTION THAT O.S.I. HAD TO COME ONE A FULLY FORMED AND MATURE DEPARTMENT IN JUST A HANDFUL OF YEARS IS A STRUGGLE, BECAUSE THERE'S A GROUP THAT GENERATED ZERO REVENUE OUTSIDE OF GRANTS AND OTHER FUNDING AND I THINK THAT THOSE GRANTS ARE GOING TO BE INCREASED UNDER THE CURRENT FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION, THAT'S OUR HOPE. I'M SURE THAT DR. STULTS WOULD AGREE THAT THERE ARE MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THAT COMING UP. BE THAT AS IT MAY, ALL OF THAT WAS BEFORE COVID AND BEFORE THE DEFICITS THAT WE ARE SHOWING AND SO BASICALLY WHAT THIS RESOLUTION IS DOING IS ASKING DR. STULTS TO ONLY ADD TWO OF THE FOUR PEOPLE THAT SHE WANTS THIS YEAR, IN AN ATTEMPT TO SLOW DOWN FOR JUST ONE FISCAL YEAR THE -- THE STRUCTURAL DEFICIT THAT IS GROWING WITH OUR CITY. AND SO I KNOW THAT'S A -- THAT WOULD BE A CHALLENGE FOR HER BUT WITHOUT TYING IT TO ANYTHING ELSE, THEY WERE GOING TO TRY TO CUT SOME LABOR COSTS AT THE CITY HERE. AND I APPRECIATE THE FOLKS FOR HELPING ME PUT IT TOGETHER AND IT IS WHAT IT IS. IT'S THE ONLY DEPARTMENT THAT'S REALLY ASKING TO ADD A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF STAFF. WHEN YOU LOOK AT YOUR STAFF TRENDS, WHICH IS ONE OF MY BUDGET QUESTIONS, THIS ERR GOING UP AGAIN. AND IT IS GOING UP IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE STRUCTURAL DEFICIT. AND I KNOW IT'S A TOUGH ASK, BUT I'M ASKING US TO ASK DR. STULTS TO ONLY HIRE HALF AS MANY PEOPLE AS SHE WANTED TO THIS YEAR. THAT'S THE ESSENCE OF IT.
02:58:33.343: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
02:58:34.511: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. IS DR. STULTS AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS?
02:58:45.088: >> City Admin. Crawford: I'M JUST LOOKING FOR JACKIE. WE'RE HAVING TO REBOOT THING GOING THROUGH. IT TAKES 30 MINUTES.
02:58:52.162: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  YOU CAN GO ON TO SOMEBODY ELSE MAYOR, AND COME BACK TO ME TO MOVE THINGS ALONG.
02:58:59.436: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER EYER.
02:59:02.672: >> Councilmember Eyer: YES, I'M NOT GOING TO SUPPORT THIS. I DON'T THINK WE CAN AFFORD TO SLOW DOWN OUR A2ZERO GOALS AND THE A2ZERO PLAN. IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT WORK. COUNCIL -- MANY OF THE MEMBERS OR CERTAINLY SOME OF THE MEMBERS SITTING HERE TONIGHT VOTES TO MOVE UP THE TIMELINE, IN FACT, FROM WHAT DR. STULTS INITIALLY PROPOSED, 2035, TO 2030. SO I THINK IT'S -- IT'S REALLY INAPPROPRIATE TO THEN BE ASKING HER TO BEAR, YOU KNOW, THE CUT HERE IN TERMS OF TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH THE GOALS THAT COUNCIL HAS SET FORTH FOR HER AND HER OFFICE. THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK ABOUT STRUCTURAL DEFICIT TONIGHT. I HAVE MADE THIS POINT BEFORE. I'M GOING TO MAKE IT AGAIN. THE BEST WAY WE CAN AVOID HAVING AN ONGOING STRUCTURAL DEFICIT IN OUR CITY, IS TO APPROVE AND ALLOW RESPONSIBLE DEVELOPMENT. PROJECTS LIKE THE VAHALLA PROJECT THAT WILL BE COMING UP IN THE FOURTH WARD WILL BRING IN A LOT OF NEW TAX DOLLARS AND THAT ALLOWS US TO CONTINUE PURSUING OUR PROGRESSIVE GOALS AS A CITY, WHILE WE, YOU KNOW, ALSO MAINTAIN ALL OF OUR OTHER SERVICES AND NOT HAVE TO CUT SERVICES FOR PEOPLE OR RAISE TAXES. SO AGAIN, I WON'T BE SUPPORTING THIS.
03:00:44.374: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER DISCH.
03:00:45.542: >> Councilmember Disch: I WILL NOT SUPPORT THIS AMENDMENT EITHER. I WANTED TO SAY THAT WHAT THE FTEs THAT ARE BEING REQUESTED WOULD DO IS, NUMBER ONE, THERE WILL BE A NEW TEAM MEMBER TO SUPPORT BENEFICIAL ELECTRIFICATION, AND WHAT THAT MEANS  IS SWAPPING OUT GAS-POWERED HVAC AND STOVE. THERE'S A TREMENDOUS INTEREST IN HEAT PUMP TECHNOLOGY IN ANN ARBOR. THERE WAS A PETEI MEETING LAST K THAT WAS ATTENDED BY HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE. AND WHAT WE NEED -- YOU KNOW, THE -- THE MARKET IS ACTUALLY LAGGING BEHIND HERE, AND SO WE DO NEED TO PUT PEOPLE POWER INTO MOVING THIS WORK FORWARD. AN AS ENERGETIC AS DR. STULTS IS, SHE CANNOT DO ALL OF THIS HERSELF. THE OTHER THING -- THE OTHER THING THAT THE POSITION THAT WOULD BE CUT WOULD BE DOING IS SUPPORTING CROSS-DEPARTMENTAL COLLABORATION WITHIN THE CITY WHICH IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT FOR A NUMBER OF THE STRATEGIES OF A2ZERO AND IT'S A LITTLE BIT AT ODDS WITH THE USUAL WAY OF WORKING AND THIS COORDINATION AND SHARING INFORMATION CAN BE DONE BY ONE PERSON ZIPPING AROUND TO DIFFERENT GROUPS, WHICH IS WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW. OR IT CAN BE DONE BY A DEDICATED PERSON WHO IS A FLOATING PERSON AND SO OUR STRATEGIES LIKE STRATEGY FOUR WHICH IS TRANSPORTATION, STRATEGY FIVE, WHICH IS SO SOLID WASTE DESPERAY NEEDS THIS TYPE OF COORDINATION. I SOLIDLY SUPPORT THIS SPENDING. IF WE NEAT T MEET WILL GOALS BY, WE NEED TO INVEST IN THEM, AND THAT'S WHERE I AM.
03:02:32.082: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
03:02:33.249: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANKS. I JUST -- YOU KNOW, LIKE I'M JUST GOING TO SPEAK TO MY WARD. WE JUST HAD A THING WHERE WE BASICALLY WAIVED PROPERTY TAX REVENUE FROM A LARGE DEVELOPMENT ON THE SOUTH SIDE, OVER ON ELLSWORTH IN WARD THREE IN EXCHANGE FOR A BENEFIT. WE WON'T SEE A PENNY OF PROPERTY TAXES FOR LOWER TOWN BECAUSE IT'S A BROWNFIELD. THE SAME FOR THE MISCH CON DEVELOPMENT AT BROADWAY VILLAGE. SO WHOEVER, WE ARE NOT GOING TO BUILD OUR WAY OUT OF A STRUCTURAL DEFICIT AND TO SUGGEST THAT WE ARE IS REALLY NOT -- NOT WHERE IT'S AT. I MEAN, WE ARE JUST NOT. A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF YOU ARE DEVELOPMENT IS BROWNFIELD AND FOR GO TAXES, DELAY OR DEFER TAXES ON THE BROW BROWNFIELD PROPERTIES. IF WE DON'T SEE VALUABLE TAXES FOR 10 YEARS OR 13 YEARS, IT'S NOT GOING TO HELP US. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO DR. STULTS, I LOOK AT THE BUDGET DIFFERENTLY THAN SOME PEOPLE DO, I THINK. I THINK MANY CRAWFORD WOULD MAYBE AGREE WITH THAT. AND, YOU KNOW, NO OFFENSE TO THE DEPARTMENT. I WAS JUST LOOKING FOR WAYS TO CUT SOME MONEY. SO THAT'S ALL IT IS. I'M SURE -- CLEARLY, THAT IS -- IT HASN'T FOUND FAVOR WITH THIS GROUP BUT I'M NOT SURPRISED BY THAT AND, YOU KNOW, WE GO AHEAD AND GO TO A VOTE THEN.
03:03:55.932: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RADINA.
03:03:57.534: >> Councilmember Radina: THANK YOU, MAYOR TAYLOR. VERY BRIEFLY, I'M SYMPATHETIC TO THE REASON FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. I ACTUALLY HAVE A SIMILAR AMENDMENT LATER IN THE BUDGET THAT WOULD ELIMINATE AN FTE FOR SIMILAR REASONS, BUT GIVEN THE URGENCY WITH WHICH THIS BODY HAS INDICATED THAT WE WANT DR. STULTS TO ABMISCH HER GOALS I DON'T THINK THAT THIS IS AN -- ACCOMPLISH HER GOALS, I DON'T THINK THAT THIS IS AN AREA. I'M INCREDIBLY EMPRESSED WITH ALL THE HARD WORK WITH THE STAFF THAT THEY HAVE AND TO INVEST MORE MONEY TOWARDS THAT AT THIS TIME I THINK IS IMPORTANT. IF WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT ACCOMPLISHING THE GOALS THAT WE SET FOR THE CITY AND FOR THIS OFFICE, BUT FOR THE REMAINDER OF MY TIME NOW THAT DR. STULTS IS WITH US, YO I DON'T KNOW IF SHE WANTS TO SPEAK TO THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE POSITIONS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. I'M HAPPY TO YIELD TO HER.
03:04:55.058: >> I'M HAPPY TO RESPOND THAT, AND COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER FOR YOUR HONESTLY AND TRYING TO CREATE A BALANCED BUDGET. IN TERMS OF WHAT WE WERE LOOKING AT FOR THE STAFFING, OUR BENEFICIAL ELECTRIFICATION WORK IS GROWING FAST AND FURIOUSLY IN HOW WE DECARBONIZE HOMES AND BUSINESS. IT'S AN AREA WE STARTED TO EXPERIMENT IN AND IT'S CONSUMING INCREDIBLE TIME AND ENERGY. AND WE NEED DEDICATED STAFF TO REALLY DRIVE THAT WORK INTENTIONALLY AND HIT THE GOALS AROUND THAT. SO THAT'S ONE VERY MAIN LIFT OF ONE OF THE POSITIONS. THE OTHER ONE IS MORE OF A GENERALIST IN THE OFFICE THAT CAN HELP WITH THE COORDINATION AS WE ORDER PREVIOUSLY, IN THE ACCOUNTS RESPONSE, WE ARTICULATED THIS A LITTLE BIT TOO. IT'S SOMEONE WHO CAN DO A LOT OF COORDINATING WORK THAT IS OFTEN -- I OFTEN DO. AND WE CAN FREE UP THE TIME IN MY PLATE AND A FEW OTHER KEY MEMBERS PLATES SO THEY CAN GO DEEPER, FURTHER AND FASTER. AND THAT WAS THENTENT AS WE DID THE MODELING AND THE WORK PLANNING FOR THIS. THANK YOU.
03:06:02.892: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
03:06:03.826: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES, THAT WAS SORT OF THE QUESTION I HAD FOR DR. STULTS AND THANKS FOR JOINING US TONIGHT. WHAT WOULD THE EFFECTS WESTBOUND CUTTING THESE TWO POSITIONS WHY YOUR PROGRAM. YOP IF YOU WANT TO EXPAND ON WHAT YOU JUSTAID -- I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO EXPAND ON WHAT YOU JUST SAID BUT I DO THEOMPARAVE ADVANTAGES AFIND DELEGATING RESPONSIBILITY SO THAT YOU COULD ACCOMPLISH MORE. AND GET TO A GOAL SOONER BUT I UNDERSTAND FIRST YOU HAVE TO DOT WORK TO UNDERSTAND HOW IT'S DONE BEFORE YOU CAN DELEGATE IT AND FIND OUT WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND, ET CETERA, HOW TO TRAIN IT AND FIND THE PITFALLS AND SUCH. I KNOW AFTER A PERIOD OF TIME, JUST AS OUR CITY PROSECUTOR HAS DONE WITH THE DIVERSION PROGRAM, THE PROGRAM HAS GOT TEEN BIG AND YOU HAVE TO -- GOTTEN TOO BIG AND YOU HAVE TO FIND OTHER PEOPLE TO TAKE OVER THE WORK. I GUESS THAT'S ALL WE. HAVE YOU ANSWERED COUNCILMEMBER RADINA WHO HAD THE SAME QUESTIONS. I HAVE SOME MORE COMMENTS TO MAKE.
03:07:14.731: >> YEAH, YEAH, THE ONLY THING I MIGHT EXPAND ON IS TO SAY THE WORK WE ARE LOOKING AT RUNNING AT IS SOMETHING THAT OUR COMMUNITY IS ASKING FOR. I DON'T THINK IF WOULD YOU HAVE ASKED ME A YEAR AGO AS WE WERE COMING OUT, YOU KNOW, JUST WITH A2ZERO THAT WE WERE READY FOR BENEFICIAL ELECTRIFICATION WORK AT THE SCALE THAT WE ARE BUT WE ARE HEARING ABOUT IT FROM THE PLANNING COMMISSION. AND WE HAD A SEMINAR ABOUT HEAT PUMPS. SO WE ARE STARTING TO SEE MOVEMENT AND INTEREST WHICH IS REALLY EXCITING FOR THE GOAL THAT WE HAD ESTABLISHED, BUT UNEXPECTED IN TERMS OF THE VOLUME OF INTEREST AND THAT'S PART OF WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO BALANCE IN THIS IS HOW FAST WE ARE ABLE TO RUN AND KEEP UP WITH OUR COMMUNICA COMMU COMMUNITY AE THAT WE ARE KEEPING UP.
03:08:05.415: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THAT'S A GOOD PROBLEM AS THEY SAY.
03:08:08.618: >> SURE. WE'LL TAKE THAT.
03:08:11.554: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER EYER.
03:08:16.392: >> Councilmember Eyer: THANKS. I WANTED TO CIRCLE BACK TO THE QUESTION ABOUT THE NEW DEVELOPMENT KEEPING US FROM A STRUCTURAL BUDGET DEFICIT. THIS CAME UP DURING LAST YEAR'S BUDGET CYCLE AND CAN WE APPROXIMATE THE AMOUNT OF GENERAL FUND REVENUE WE AS PART OF FISCAL YEAR '21 PROJECTIONS ATTRIBUTABLE FROM THE CONSTRUCTION GROWTH. AND THE RESPONSE WAS THAT NEW CONSTRUCTION ADDED $1.054 BILLION IN TAXABLE VALUE TO THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR GENERAL FUN OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS. SO FOR THE TEN YEARS OF NEW CONSTRUCTION, USING THE MILLAGE RATE GENERATED -- YEAH, WE'RE KEEPING OUR HEAD ABOVE WATER BECAUSE OF NEW CONSTRUCTION. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT DOESN'T GET LOST IN THE RHETORIC HERE.
03:09:18.020: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
03:09:18.921: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THIS PUBLIC DEBATE IS NOT RHETORIC. TO DIMINISH OUR STATEMENTS AS OFTEN AS COUNCILMEMBER EYER DOES IS JUST IN CONFLICT WITH THE NEW RULES AND ETHICS AND NORMS THAT WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE FOLLOWING.
03:09:34.570: >> Councilmember Eyer: POINT OF ORDER.
03:09:39.242: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I COULD SAY THAT TO YOU EARLIER. I COULD SAY THAT TO ALMOST TIME YOU SPEAK. YOU DON'T SPEAK TO THE ISSUES.
03:09:46.315: >> Mayor Taylor: WHAT IS THE POINT OF ORDER?
03:09:50.820: >> Councilmember Eyer: WE ARE VEERING OFF TOPIC ONCE AGAIN.
03:09:54.223: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  YOU DRIVE THE BUS.
03:09:58.361: >> Councilmember Eyer: INTO PERSONAL ISSUES.
03:09:59.629: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  SO ON THE NEW CONSTRUCTION. I WILL JUST SAY THAT IT'S AKIN TO A PONZI SCENE. WE'RE GOING TO RUN OUT OF THINGS TO REDEVELOP, WE ARE CONSTRAINED BY THIS HIGHWAY DOUGHNUT. EVENTUALLY WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO BUILD? I'M NOT SURE THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO GET OUT OF A STRUCTURAL DEFICIT. AND FURTHERMORE, PEOPLE WHO MOVE INTO OUR COMMUNITY WILL NEED SERVICED AS WELL. WE NEED TO IMPROVE OUR INFRASTRUCTURE. THEY NEED PUBLIC SAFETY. FIRE, POLICE, TRASH. IT'S NOT THAT WE WILL TAKE ALL OF THIS MONEY AND IT GOES DOWN TO OUR BOTTOM LINE. IT COSTS MONEY. TO SERVICE OUR CONSTITUENTS AND TO HAVE RESIDENTS JOIN US. IT'S NOT 100% ALL TO THE BOTTOM LINE. I WILL PUSH BACK ON THIS IDEA OF NEW CONSTRUCTION AS A WAY TO FUND OURSELVES OUT OF OUR STRUCTURAL DEFICIT. I WILL SAY EVENTUALLY WE ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE THESE SUPPLEMENT ALLAAL PAYMENTS TO OR HEALTHCARE AND PENSION FUNDS. ONCE WE GET TO THAT, WE WILL HAVE A LOT MORE MONEY TO PLAY WITH. I DON'T KNOW WHEN THAT WILL BE. WHEN IT COMES TO THE HEALTHCARE, I THINK WE ARE LOOKING AT ANOTHER SIX OR EIGHT YEARS BUT AFTER THAT, THEN WE CAN START HAVING SOME BREATHING ROOM. I THINK WE NEED TO BE COGNIZANT OF THAT FACT. THAT'S WHERE MOST OF OUR STRUCTURAL DEFICIT COMES FROM IS BECAUSE OF OUR UNFUNDED LIABILITIES. ONCE WE MAKE WHOLE ON THAT ISSUE, WE WILL HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY TO PLAY WITH.
03:11:45.468: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND?
03:11:46.636: >> Councilmember Grand: I WOULD LIKE TO THANK DR. STULTS. I WAS TALKING TO MY WARD COLLEAGUE TODAY AND THINKING OFTEN IN THE ORGANIZATION, I FEEL LIKE EVERYONE WEARS LIKE A -- LIKE A WWMD, WHAT WOULD MISSY DO IN THIS SITUATION BECAUSE SHE IS SUCH A, YOU KNOW BEING STRONG LEADER AND INNOVATOR AND COMES TO US WITH REALLY CLEAR LANGUAGE AND UNDERSTANDING AND TA TIES IT INA PLAN IN TERMS OF WHAT THE STAFF IS GETTING US AND HOW IT TIES TO THE A2ZERO PLAN AND KEEPING THE PULSE IN OUR COMMUNICATE AND HOW CHANGING -- COMMUNITY AND HOW THE CHANGING CIRCUMSTANCES MAY NEED US TO ADAPT BUT IT'S TYING BACK TO THAT PLAN. SO I'M SORRY. IF IT WERE MY CHOICE, WE WOULD DO NOTHING BUT PRAISE YOU ALL THE TIME. SO THANK YOU AND I'M LOOKED FORWARD TO VOTING THIS DOWN SO YOU CAN DO YOUR WORK.
03:12:49.198: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? I DO OPPOSE CUTTING FUNDS FROM THE OFFICE OF SUSTAINABILITY. THE CITIES AND COMMUNITIES SWIFT AND ACCELERATING PROGRESS ON THE COMMUNITIES A2ZERO PLAN IS -- IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. TAKING DECISIVE ACTION WITH RESPECT TO DECARBONIZATION IS IMPORTANT, AND THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO DO AS A COMMUNITY AND WE DON'T DO IT WITH FEWER PEOPLE. SO I WILL VOTE AGAINST THIS AMENDMENT. AND ECHO THE PRAISE FOR THE OFFICE OF O.S.I. AND DR. STULTS. FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER RADINA.
03:13:40.015: >> Councilmember Radina: NO.
03:13:42.518: >> Mayor Taylor: NO.
03:13:43.285: >> Councilmember Eyer: NO.
03:13:43.853: >> Councilmember Nelson:  NO.
03:13:48.557: >> Councilmember Briggs: NO.
03:13:49.158: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  NO.

03:13:57.466: >> Councilmember Griswold: NO.
03:14:02.838: >> Councilmember Song: NO.
03:14:04.473: >> Councilmember Grand: NO.
03:14:05.174: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION FAILS.
03:14:11.580: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN MOTION AS AMENDED.
03:14:18.020: >> Councilmember Grand: I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE AMENDMENT NUMBER NINE. THIS IS A COMPANION OUT OF LEGAL. UNFORTUNATELY -- FOR NOT AS JOYOUS OF AN OCCASION AS BEING ABLE TO CELEBRATE THE SERVICE OF MR. POSTEMA AS HE MOVES ON TO RETIREMENT. BUT FOR SUBSTANTIAL LITIGATION THAT THE CITY IS FACING AND FUNDING FOR EXPERT WITNESSES. IT DOESN'T COME OUT OF THE GENERAL FUN BUT IT DOES COME OUT OF THE -- THE GENERAL FUN BUT IT COMES OUT OF THE THREE FUNDS WHICH THIS LAWSUIT IS TARGETING.
03:14:50.519: >> City Atty. Postema: IT'S EXPERT WITNESSES AND LEGAL FEES, YES.
03:14:53.989: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU.
03:14:54.790: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE A SECOND? SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
03:15:00.095: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. COULD YOU HELP US UNDERSTAND WHAT PERCENTAGE IS GOING TO GO TO THE EXPERTS, THE WITNESS -- THE EXPERT WITNESSES AND WHAT TYPE OF EXPERT WITNESSES? HOW MUCH OF THIS WILL BE GOING TO THAT AND HOW MUCH OF IT WILL BE GOING TO ATTORNEY FEES?
03:15:19.949: >> City Atty. Postema: I DON'T KNOW RIGHT NOW. IT WOULD DEPEND ON TORT OF WHAT HAPPENS OVER -- SORT OF WHAT HAPPENS OVER THE NEXT YEAR. WE HAVE GIVEN YOU A LITIGATION SUMMARY OF THIS CASE EXTENSIVE IN JANUARY, AND SO AS FAR AS THE SPECIFIC ALLOCATIONS --
03:15:41.370: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I APOLOGIZE FOR CUTTING IN. CAN'T THIS COME BACK AS A BUDGET AMENDMENT ONCE WE HAVE SPECIFICS, RATHER THAN GIVING A BLANK CHECK?
03:15:54.683: >> City Atty. Postema: WELL.
03:15:55.718: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  WE MADE MANY BUDGET CHANGES MID-YEAR. THERE'S NOTHING SPECIFIC GIVEN HERE AND YOU ARE ASKING FOR $200,000. SPECIFIC IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH IT GOES AND WHAT TYPE OF WITNESSES AND WHAT TYPE OF ATTORNEYS.
03:16:15.304: >> City Atty. Postema: COUNCILME MBER, YOU CAN CERTAINLY DO THAT, BUT THE PREFERENCE IS TO PUT THINGS IN THE BUDGET AND SO THAT IS WHAT WE ARE DOING HERE AT LEAST WE KNOW THAT THERE WILL BE A START. FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THIS AND WHAT THE ALLOCATION OF IT COULD CERTAINLY BE DONE IN CLOSED SESSION AND IT COULD BE DONE BEFORE THE NEXT AMENDMENT ON ANY CONTRACTS BUT THIS IS JUST A PRUDENT MOVE AT THIS POINT. IF WE DON'T NEED IT. WE DON'T NEED IT.
03:16:52.474: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
03:16:53.609: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I THINK THAT MR. POSTEMA GOT CLOSE TO MY CONCERNS ABOUT THIS, THAT WE CAN'T HAVE A FRANK CONVERSATION ABOUT OUR LEGAL STRATEGIES AROUND THIS TOPIC FOR OBVIOUS REASONS AND IT MAKES IT A CHALLENGE TO DECIDE WHETHER THIS IS APPROPRIATE OR NOT. IT'S A BUDGET. IT SITS IN THERE. IT WILL LIKELY GET SPENT. WHICH IS UNFORTUNATE I KNOW WE ALL HAVE DIFFERENT FEELINGS ON HOW TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE VARIOUS THINGS THAT COME BEFORE US AS A BODY AND A CITY. I --
03:17:35.184: >> City Atty. Postema: COUNSEL, YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED ABOUT LITIGATION AND LITIGATION COSTS EXTENSIVELY IN THIS CASE.
03:17:40.656: >> Councilmember Hayner: SURE.
03:17:44.393: >> City Atty. Postema: WELL, THE ANSWER IS NOT SURE. YES, YOU HAVE.
03:17:46.795: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES, WE HAVE AND I WILL NOT SUPPORT THIS.
03:17:51.834: >> City Atty. Postema: OKAY.
03:17:52.434: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RADINA.
03:17:57.740: >> Councilmember Radina: THANK YOU, I DON'T NECESSARILY SEE THIS AS A BLANK CHECK. I THINK IT'S RELATIVELY CLEAR HERE WHERE THE MONEY WOULD BE GOING TO AND I ALSO JUST WANT TO -- I DON'T -- I DON'T AS A COUNSEL MEMBER EXPECT THAT I WILL BE DETERMINING THE LEGAL STRATEGY ON EACH CASE MOVING FORWARD. THAT'S WHAT WE HIRE OUR ATTORNEYS TO DO AND PLACE OUR TRUST IN OUR ATTORNEYS. AND SO -- AND SO ON THIS, I MEAN WE ARE HEARING FROM OUR ATTORNEY THAT WE NEED FUNDING FOR -- WE NEED POTENTIAL FUNDING FOR EXPERT WITNESSES AND FOR MOVING FORWARD IN THIS CASE. AND SO I'M GOING TO TRUST THAT ADVICE OF OUR ATTORNEY AND I WILL SUPPORT THIS AND -- AND AS HE SAID, IF THEY DON'T END UP NEEDING THIS FULL AMOUNT OF MONEY, THEN THAT WILL ULTIMATELY BE MONEY RETURNED BACK TO THE BUDGET. SO THANKS.
03:18:49.658: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
03:18:50.592: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I DON'T HAVE AS BIG OF A PROBLEM WITH THIS BECAUSE IT'S COMING FROM THE ENTERPRISE FUNDS. ESE ARE NOT TAXPAYER DOLLARS. YOU KNOW, THESE ARE MONIES GENERAD OM THE ENTERISE FUND WE ARE UNDER CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT, AND WE HAVEN'T HAD AN UPDATE ON THAT RECENTLY. I FEEL THAT WE SHOULD BE PROBABLY BETTER INFORMED BEFORE APPROVING THIS. I UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE. IT'S IN NO WAY TO DIMINISH OUR WORK THAT IS BEING DONE IN ADDRESSING THE GELMAN PLUME. BUT ALL THREE FUNDS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT. I THINK WE SHOULD BE PROBABLY A LITTLE BIT MORE CAREFUL AS TO HOW THOSE MONIES ARE SPENT AND PROBABLY HAVE A CLOSED SESSION MEETING TO DISCUSS THIS AND A BETTER PRESCRIPTION BEFORE, YOU KNOW, I FEEL COMFORTABLE IN VOTING FOR IT. I'M NOT -- I'M NOT HERE DEBATING LEGAL STRATEGY. THAT'S NOT MY HESITATION AND ULTIMATELY, FAILURE THAT I HAVE ON SUPPORTING THIS RIGHT NOW.
03:19:56.225: >> City Atty. Postema: COUNCILME MBER, I WOULD SUGGEST THAT CERTAINLY WE CAN DO THAT. WE UPDATE YOU REGULARLY. WE ARE HAPPY TO DO THAT. IT'S CERTAINLY BEFORE ANY CONTRACT AMENDMENT THAT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE, BUT RIGHT NOW, WE ARE JUST AMENDING THE BUDGET AND SO THE BUDGETS TONIGHT. THAT'S MY ADVICE.
03:20:17.646: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THE AMENDMENT. I HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF CONFIDENCE IN OUR LEGAL TEAM UP AND DOWN THE LINE, INCLUDING THE FOLKS THAT THEY CHOOSE TO HIRE TO HELP US IN CONNECTION WITH THIS -- WITH THIS SUIT. I THINK IT'S PROPER THAT WE GIVE THEM THE ABILITY TO DO IT, AND GIVE THEM THE ABILITY TO DO IT INCLUDES, IN MY VIEW, FUNDING IT ON THE UP FRONT. FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER RADINA.
03:20:57.519: >> Councilmember Radina: YES.
03:20:59.855: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
03:21:02.224: >> Councilmember Eyer: YES.
03:21:02.824: >> Councilmember Nelson:  YES.
03:21:07.563: >> Councilmember Briggs: YES.
03:21:08.197: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  NO.
03:21:10.499: >> Councilmember Hayner:  NO.
03:21:15.604: >> Councilmember Disch: YES.
03:21:16.205: >> Councilmember Griswold: NO.
03:21:21.243: >> Councilmember Song: YES.
03:21:21.843: >> Councilmember Grand: YES.
03:21:23.011: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION CARRIES.
03:21:25.981: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN MOTION AS AMENDED? COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS?
03:21:34.590: >> Councilmember Briggs: I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE AMENDMENT EIGHT.
03:21:37.960: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE A SECOND? SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER DISCH. COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS.
03:21:45.300: >> Councilmember Briggs: SO THIS AMENDMENT IS ABOUT REALLOCATING TO THE% THAT WE USE ON -- THE 20% THAT WE USE ON THE PEDESTRIAN SAFETY ON THE QUANTITY HEALTH MILLAGE. IT MAINTAINS THE $135,000 FOR UNCONTROLLED CROSSWALK LIGHTING NEEDS. AND IT MAINTAINS FUNDING FOR EXISTING STREETLIGHT REPLACEMENTS, BUT A LOWER -- A REDUCED LEVEL OF $100,000 RATHER THAN THE 200 PLUS THOUSAND. AND IT REDUCES THE AMOUNT THAT WAS SPENT -- THAT WAS ALLOCATED FOR PEDESTRIAN SAFETY EDUCATION TO $15,000 WHICH I HAVE CHECKED WITH THE COMMUNICATIONS FIRM TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN STILL DO MEANINGFUL WORK FOR THAT AMOUNT AND I WAS TOLD THAT WE COULD. WHAT IT ADDS IN ADDITION IS TRAFFIC CALMING WHICH WAS IN THE C.I. P. AND APPROVED BY THE PLANNING COMMISSION. IT WAS IDENTIFIED INTO THE COMPREHENSIVE TRANSPORTATION PLAN. THE DRAFT PLAN IS SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD BE WORKING ON IN YEAR ONE. IT ALSO HAS $150,000 FOR CURB EXTENSIONS AND CENTER LINE HARDENING SLOW TURN WEDGE TREATMENTS, WHICH ARE REALLY ABOUT IMPROVING PEDESTRIAN SAFETY AT INTERSECTIONS WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE IDENTIFIED AS -- AS WORK THAT WE NEED TO BE DOING IN YEAR ONE. SO THIS IS REALLY JUST ABOUT, I THINK -- I THINK STAFF HAS BEEN IN A HARD PLACE. WE DON'T HAVE OUR COMPREHENSIVE TRANSPORTATION PLAN YET ADOPTED. IT'S GONE THROUGH MANY PARTS OF THE PROCESS, AND IT WILL COME IN FRONT OF OUR BODY AT -- SOMETIME SOON HOPEFULLY TO ADOPT AND I HOPE WE WILL BE SUPPORTING IT. I WILL BE SUPPORTING IT, BUT THESE ARE -- THESE ARE PIECES THAT ARE DETERMINED THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING IN YEAR ONE BUT THEY ARE NOT IN OUR BUDGET AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE NOT FALLING BEHIND IN YEAR ONE THAT. WE ARE NOT SPENDING MONEY TO CREATE BUTFU BUTFUL -- BEAUTIFUS THAT WE DON'T IMPLEMENT.
03:23:48.657: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD?
03:23:51.960: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I SEE THAT CURB EXTENSIONS AND CENTER LINE HARDENING AS PART OF THE QUICK BUILD AND I WOULD SUPPORT THEM THERE. GIVE THAN WE HAD A TEN-YEAR PORE MORATORIUM ON STREETLIGHTS UP UNTIL 2016, AND THE FACT THAT WE STILL HAVE MANY CROSSWALKS WITH NO ILLUMINATION, AND I HAVE ASKED THAT QUESTION OF STAFF, AND THEY HAVE GIVEN ME VERY CREATIVE ANSWERS THAT HAVE TO DO WITH THE C.I.P. AND POSITIVE CONTRAST LIGHTING, BUT I STILL DO NOT HAVE THE ANSWER HOW MANY CROSSWALKS DO WE HAVE WITH NO ILLUMINATION. AND THE REASON THAT THAT'S VERY, VERY IMPORTANT IS WE HAD IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS, WE HAD ONE DEATH, AND ONE VERY SERIOUS INJURY CRASH, AND I DON'T -- MAYBE THERE WERE MORE. I DON'T KNOW. BUT THERE ARE THREE CROSSWALKS IN MY -- ON EHRHARDT ROAD, JUST NORTH OF GEDDES. ONE IS AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CROSSWALK, NO ILLUMINATION. ANOTHER ONE IS BETWEEN THE SPORTS FIELD FOR CONCORDIA COLLEGE AND IT'S REALLY CONFUSING BECAUSE CONCORDIA COLLEGE PAID TO HAVE THE CROSSWALK PUT IN, BUT WE DIDN'T REQUEST THAT THEY PUT LIGHTING. SO WHAT CONCORD HAS DONE IS THEY PUT LITTLE PEDESTRIAN STOP SIGNS SO THAT THE PEDESTRIANS STOP FOR THE CARS AT THAT CROSSWALK WHICH SIMPLY LEADS TO MORE CONFUSION. SO I AM ALL FOR SPENDING MORE ON PEDESTRIAN SAFETY. I CANNOT REMOVE ANY OF THE FUNDING FOR STREETLIGHTS. IN FACT, I WAS TRYING TO GET AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE STREET -- WATT CROSSWALKS -- THE NUMBER THAT DID NOT HAVE LIGHTING RIGHT NOW, ILLUMINATION. SO I COULD HAVE A BUDGET AMENDMENT RECORDING THAT, HOWEVER, STAFF FOR SOME REASON WAS NOT ABLE TO GIVE ME THAT INFORMATION.
03:26:08.663: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
03:26:11.600: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THIS ONE FOR MANY DIFFERENT REASONS. I FILE LIKE WE'RE CIRCUMVENTING OUR EXECUTIVE STAFF. WE'RE CI CIRCUMVENTING THAT WAST FORWARD BY OUR CITY ADMINISTRATION, AND WAYS THAT THEY SEE FIT AND THEY THINK WORKS BEST. WE -- WE -- I UNDERSTAND THERE'S -- THERE'S A LOT OF TIMES -- THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS IN THE C.I.P. THAT DON'T GET DONE. WE LOOK AT IT YEAR-BY-YEAR. WE HAVE A FIVE-YEAR PLAN BUT THAT CHANGES CONSTANTLY BASED ON OUR RESOLVING NEEDS AND RESOURCES. SO TO SAY THAT IT'S IN THE C.I.P. TO MEAN THAT IT'S AS GOOD AS GOLD, THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY HOW IT WORKS. AND I JUST -- I FEEL THAT WE ARE TAKING AWAY FROM OTHER PRIORITIES IN ORDER TO FUND THESE OTHER ONES THAT -- THAT, YOU KNOW, A FEW COUNCILMEMBERS HAVE A BIG PERSONAL INTEREST IN. AND I RESPECT THAT, BUT I FEEL IT'S JUMPING THE LINE. WE HAD A TEN-YEAR MORATORIUM ON STREETLIGHTS. I WOULD LIKE TO ASK STAFF WHERE ARE WE IN CATCHING ONE THAT BACKLOG THAT WE NOW PROPOSE TO HAVE ITS FUNDING SLASHED.
03:27:45.193: >> City Admin. Crawford: CRAIG, IS THAT SOMETHING YOU CAN RESPOND TO?
03:27:49.598: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  YOU CAN ALWAYS COME BACK TO IT.
03:27:53.802: >> SORRY, I WAS GETTING MYSELF OFF OF MUTE.
03:27:57.005: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, MR. HUPY.
03:28:00.642: >> YES. RAYMOND, ARE YOU ABLE TO SAY WHERE WE ARE IN THE -- WHERE WE WERE EXPECTING THE $200,000 ANNUALLY UP UPWARD CATCHUP ON OR STREETLIGHTS.
03:28:20.395: >> SO RAYMOND HESS, GOOD EVENING AGAIN. JUST LET ME MAKE A QUICK DISTINCTION. TYPICALLY WHEN WE FOCUS ON CROSSWALK LIGHTING, WE ARE TYPICALLY FOE ON MAJOR UNCONTROL -- FOCUSED ON MAJOR UNCONTROLLED CROSSWALKS. SO THE NUMBER I'M ABOUT TO PROVIDE IS THAT. IT DOESN'T INCLUDE NEIGHBORHOOD. WE HAVE 123 MAJOR UNCONTROLLED CROSSWALKS WHICH DO NOT HAVE POSITIVE CONTRAST LIGHTING. THAT'S AN IMPORTANT DISTINCTION. THERE MAY BE LIGHTING AT SOME, BUT IS IT'S NOT POSITIVE CONTRAST. THOSE ARE THE ONES WE ARE AWARE OF, BUT I WILL MENTION THAT MORE CROSSWALKS COME ONLINE. ANY TIME WE TOUCH A CROSSWALK, WE UPGRADE THAT LIGHTING. IF A NEW CROSSWALK COMES ON, THEN THAT WILL GET LIGHTING AS WELL. SO SOMETIMES THAT NUMBER KIND OF INCREASES OVER TIME, OR AT LEAST THE TOTAL NUMBER OF LIGHTING NEEDS INCREASES OVER TIME. IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH WE ESTIMATE FOR CROSSWALK LIGHTING, IT REALLY RUNS A PRETTY WIDE RANGE OF DOLLAR FIGURES. IF WE USE A BALLPARK FIGURE, WE USE ABOUT $8,000 PER STREETLIGHT. THAT'S BASED ON ESTIMATES FROM WE HAVE $2,000 UP TO $16,000. IT'S DEPENDENT UPON HOW READILY AVAILABLE ELECTRICITY IS AND A WHOLE BUNCH OF OTHER FACTORS AND IF THERE'S TREE TRIMS REQUIRED AND IF ANY OTHER EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS TO BE MOVED. SO IT'S HARD TO COME UP WITH A VERY EXACT NUMBER BECAUSE THAT NUMBER FLUCTUATES BASED ON THE INSTALLATION. SO IF YOU WANT A ROUND NUMBER $8,000. WHATEVER BUDGET NUMBER YOU ARE TRYING TO BACK INTO, JUST USE $8,000 AS THE DENOMINATOR.
03:30:17.512: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
03:30:18.379: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I AGREE WHEN YOU READ THROUGH THIS. YOU WILL THINK THAT STREETLIGHT REPLACEMENTS ARE REDUCED AND REALLOCATED TO THESE OTHER USES, IT'S A LITTLE CONCERNING. THAT'S MY BIGGEST PROBLEM, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE OF THEIR TRAINING AND RIGHTLY SO, ENGINEERS OPERATE IN A CERTAIN TYPE OF WORLD WHERE IT'S A THEORETICAL PERFECT ENVIRONMENT. THEY GET ABOUT THINGS LIKE DIRTY WINDSHIELDS AND PEOPLE WEARING BLACK HOODIES AND DARTING ACROSS. NOT THAT THEY FORGET ABOUT IT, BUT ON THE PAGE, IT'S THEORETICAL, RIGHT? AND SO WE WILL TAKE SOME OF THIS MONEY AWAY AND MOVE IT HERE BUT I THINK WHAT IS A HOOT OF ALL OF THIS IS WE HAVE JUST NOW TAKEN FOR GRANTED THAT COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH MILLAGE MONEY SHOULD BE USED CARTE BLANCHE FOR PEDESTRIAN SAFETY. ITAS NOTHING TO DO WITH COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH. WE HAVE HUGE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS IN OUR COMMUNITY, ESPECIALLY AFTER A YEAR AND A HALF OF COVID. WE HAVE REQUESTS FROM PEOPLE TO CUT VARIOUS OTHER FUNDING SOURCES LIKE OUR POLICE DEPARTMENT TO INCREASE MENTAL HEALTH FUNDING. AND NOW WE'RE JUST TREATING THIS $500,000 FROM THE MENTAL HEALTH MILLAGE THAT OF COURSE IT'S PEDESTRIAN SAFETY AND INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT KIND OF BEGS THE QUESTION HAVE WE LOST SIGHT OF WHAT THAT WAS ALL ABOUT IN THE FIRST PLACE? IT WAS A MENTAL HEALTH MILLAGE. SECOND THING REAL QUICKLY, I HAVE BEEN DOWNTOWN WKI F A AND THESE CB EXTSIONS, THE SLOW TURN WEDGES AND STUFF, TRAFFIC CALMING, THEY ARE BLACKENED -- BLACKENED BY CAR TIRES. THE BUSES CONDITION EVEN MAKE THE TURN FROM FIFTH ON TO WILLIAM PROPERLY. THEY HAVE RUN OVER THE CONES ON THE WILLIAMS BIKE LANE SO MANY TIMES, THE CURBS ARE BLACK WITH TIRES. HOW DOES IT INDICATE THAT IT'S MAKING IT SAFER FOR PEDESTRIANS. PEOPLE ARE RUNNING OVER THE CURVE BUMPS AND STUFF. SOMEHOW THAT'S SAFER? ONE OF THEM IS TERRIBLE COMING ON NORTH DIVISION BY COMMUNITY DIVISION, WE HAVE A CURVE BUMP THAT MADE IT NARROWER. IT PUT THE PEDESTRIAN IN FRONT OF THE LINE OF PARKED CARS WHERE THEY CAN'T BE SEEN INSTEAD OF BACK ON THE SIDEWALK WHERE THEY CAN BE SEEN. AND I QUESTION THE EFFICACY OF SOME OF THE THESE REENGINEERING IN OUR ROADWAYS AND THE DECENCY IN USING MENTAL HEALTH FUNDING AND SUCH. I DON'T SUPPORT THIS. I JUST CAN'T. IT'S BETTER GOALS AND MORE IN KEEPING WITH OUR PLAN, I UNDERSTAND COUNCILWOMAN BRIGGS, THIS IS YOUR THING AND THAT'S GREAT, BUT JUST GENERALLY, I WILL NOT SUPPORT SPENDING COUNTY HEALTH MILLAGE ON PEDESTRIANS IN ANY MANNER. THANK YOU.
03:32:58.706: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS.
03:33:00.308: >> Councilmember Briggs: NOT TO DEBATE THE FUNDING SOURCE SINCE THIS WAS, BUT TO DISCUSS A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THESE AMENDMENTS, I AGREE WITH COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD THAT UNCONTROLLED CROSSWALKS NEED LIGHTING. THAT'S WHY THIS NUMBER DID NOT SHIFT. THAT'S IN THE COMPREHENSIVE DRAFT TRANSPORTATION PLAN. THAT'S F A PRIORITY. WE HAVE LIMITED FUNDS TO MAKE THESE IMPROVEMENTS IDENTIFIED IN OUR PLANS. AND WE CONDITION DO EVERYTHING. AND SO WE HAVE SPENT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO DEVELOP A PLAN AND FOR CONSULTANTS TO LET US KNOW WHAT OUR TOP PRIORITY SHOULD BE AND WE HAVE THAT PLAN IN FRONT OF US. SAM SCHWARTZ AND STAFF AND COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN ENGAGED FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS AND IT HAS CLEAR RECOMMENDATIONS. AND WHAT WE KNOW WHAT WILL GET US TO VISION ZERO IS WE HAVE TO REDUCE SPEEDS. THAT'S SIMPLE. THAT'S HOW WE PROTECT LIVES. THAT'S HOW WE SAVE LIVES. THAT'S HOW WE REDUCE SERIOUS INJURIES AND SO THIS REALLOCATION IS REALLY JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE MOVING FORWARD WITH THE TOP PRIORITY ITEMS THAT I SEE IDENTIFIED IN THE COMPREHENSIVE TRANSPORTATION PLAN THAT WILL BE -- WE'LL BE STARTING TO IMPLYING IN FISCAL YEAR '22, BUT SOME OF THE KEY PIECES WE JUST HAVEN'T BUDGETED FOR YET. IN TERMS OF STREETLIGHT REPLACEMENTS, THESE ARE EXISTING ASSET MANAGEMENT IS REALLY IMPORTANT, BUT THE REALITY IS THAT THIS WASN'T IDENTIFIED AS THE TOP PRIORITY IN THIS PLAN. SO THIS IS STILL MOVING FORWARD ON THAT. BUT JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE SLOWLY.
03:34:48.016: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER EYER.
03:34:49.917: >> Councilmember Eyer: I WILL BE SUPPORTING. THIS I APPRECIATE ESPECIALLY COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS AND HER EXPERTISE ON THIS ISSUE HAVING BEEN SUCH AN ADVOCATE FOR MULTIMOLDAL TRANSPORTATION, SERVING ON THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION. YOU KNOW, I CERTAINLY RESPECT OUR CITY STAFF IN COMING UP WITH WHAT THE ALLOCATIONS SHOULD BE. BUT WE HAVE MEMBERS OF COUNCIL WHO HAVE EXPERTISE IN CERTAIN AREAS AND THIS IS ONE WHERE COUNCILMEMBER GRIGGS KNOWS HER STUFF. AND SO I DEGREE THAT THESE ALLOCATIONS SEEM TO FOLLOW THE TRANSPORTATION PLAN AND THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. I ALSO WANT TO JUST PARTICUCLARIFY THATTHESE ARE COH FUNDS THAT WE ARE USING. THEY ARE NOT COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH FUNDS. THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR RECEIVES A REBATE FROM THE MENTAL HEALTH AND PUBLIC SAFETY MILLAGE. WE CONTRIBUTE OUR FAIR SHARE TO THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH FUND. AND WE RECEIVE THE REBATE BECAUSE WE DO NOT USE THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT FOR PUBLIC SAFETY. WE HAVE OUR OWN POLICE FORCE. SO THESE ARE UNRESTRICTED FUNDS. WE ARE NOT USING MENTAL HEALTH FUFUNDS TO FUND THESE PRIORITIE. IT'S BEEN A LONG STANDING COUNCIL POLICY TO USE THEM THIS WAY. SO LET'S JUST STOP PROMOTING THAT FALSEHOOD, PLEASE.
03:36:28.483: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
03:36:30.251: >> Councilmember Grand: I DON'T HAVE A LOT TO ADD TO THAT, OTHER THAN TO THANK COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS FOR THIS WORK. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE START ALIGNING WITH OUR TRANSPORTATION PLAN, WHICH, YOU KNOW, IS RELATIVELY NEW. SO I'M SURE WHEN MAKING THIS BUDGET, -- I THINK IT ALSO SPEAKS TO MAYBE NOT OFFICIAL OLD COUNCIL POLICY, BUT PRIOR COUNCIL POLICY IN TERMS OF AN APPROACH TO STREETLIGHTS VERSUS OTHER PRIORITIES IN TERMS OF SLOWING DOWN OUR SPEEDS, WHICH WE KNOW IS SO ESSENTIAL TO VISION ZERO AND TO SAFETY. SO I REALLY TO APPRECIATE THAT PERSPECTIVE. I KNOW THAT I CONTINUE TO HEAR FROM MORE AND MORE RESIDENTS AT A DESIRE TO CALM TRAFFIC AND LOOKING AT THESE DIFFERENT KINDS OF TREATMENTS, I THINK IS CRITICAL IMPORTANT TO OUR GOALS. SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS AND REALLY DO APPRECIATE THE APPROACH THAT COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS TOOK AND THE COLLABORATIVE APPROACH OF STAFF.
03:37:43.191: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER NELSON?
03:37:45.493: >> Councilmember Nelson: SORRY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE. I'M NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS FOR REASONS THAT I DIDN'T EXPECT WHEN I FIRST READ IT. I HAD A CONVERSATION WITH SOMEBODY ON STAFF ABOUT THE -- THE DECIMATING THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WE'RE DEVOTING TO THE OUTREACH AND EDUCATION, AND THE TRUTH IS THAT WE HAVE CROSSWALK LAW THAT IS DIFFERENT THAN INJURY ELSE IN THE STATE. AND IF WE ARE GOING TO BUILD ON A CULTURE OF UNDERSTANDING ABOUT HOW DRIVERS ARE GOING TO INTERACT IN THE ENVIRONMENT THAT WE HAVE CREATED, I JUST -- THAT JUST SEEMS REALLY RECKLESS TO ME. IN ADDITION TO THE TREAT LIGHT ISSUE WHICH I -- YOU KNOW, I HAVE GOTTEN CALLS FROM CONSTITUENTS ABOUT -- I HEARD THIS CRASH LAST NIGHT, AND WHEN I WENT OUT AND LOOKED, I REALIZED THAT THE STREET LIGHT WAS OUT AND THIS ACCIDENT BASICALLY HAPPENED BECAUSE THERE WAS NO LIGHTING, BECAUSE THE STREET LIGHT WAS OUT. IT FEELS LIKE WE ARE TAKING MONEY AWAY FROM NEEDS THAT ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. I MEAN WE LIVE IN A COMMUNITY WITH A VERY TRANSIENT POPULATION, AND NOW WE ARE GOING FROM 130 WHATEVER THOUSAND DOLLARS TO $15,000 IN TRYING TO HELP OUR COMMUNITY UNDERSTAND WHAT THE EXPECTATIONS ARE AND WE GOT A LITTLE BUILT OF A TASTE LAST YEAR WHEN WE DID SOME PRETTY SERIOUS TRAFFIC CALMING MEASURES ON MAJOR STREETS AND JUST HOW ANGRY PEOPLE WERE AND HOW FRUSTRATED THEY WERE. AWN AND ONE OF THE SHORTCOMINGS THAT WAS IDENTIFIED WITH THE HEALTHY STREETS PROBLEM WAS THE LACK OF UNDERSTANDING AND THE LACK OF EDUCATION ABOUT, LIKE, WHY THIS IS HAPPENING AND WHAT'S THE POINT OF IT, AND YEAH, I -- I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS. I DO UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S COMING FROM A GOOD PLACE. SO THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS T FOR BRINGING IT. THANK YOU.
03:40:06.033: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
03:40:07.034: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I WILL PUSH BACK THAT WE HAVE RESIDENT EXPERT. WITH ALL THE WORK BY PEDESTRIAN SAFETY. I REMEMBER A COMMENT AND I WAS TOLD THAT THERE AS WAS A CONFLICT OF INTEREST TO REACHING OUT TO ME WHEN IT CAME TO THIRD-PARTY DELIVERY SERVICES. SO, AGAIN YORK SEE ANY CONSISTENCY. I SEE A LOT OF DOUBLE STANDARDS WHEN IT COMES TO IMPLEMENTING POLICY AND WHO WE ARE LISTENING TO ON COUNSEL. COUNCIL.WHAT IS THE CURRENT BAC. AND BEFORE I GET THAT ANSWER, WHAT IS THE CURRENT BACKLOG -- AND I APPRECIATE MR. HESS EXPLAINING THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE REPLACEMENTS, BUT WHAT IS OUR BACKLOG ON THOSE REPLACEMENTS? THERE WAS A TEN-YEAR MORATORIUM. IN ADDITION DO WE HAVE A ZERO -- A VISION ZERO CHAMPION? A VISION ZERO EXPERT WHO IS MAKING THESE DECISIONS FOR US ON STAFF YET? I KNOW WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT IT IN PRIOR YEARS. IS THERE SOMEBODY WHO CAN REALLY LOOK AT THIS WHO IS NOT A COUNCILMEMBER WHO IS A PAID PROFESSIONAL AND STAFF EXPERT WHO HAS THE CREDENTIALS?
03:41:24.311: >> COUNCILMEMBER, THE FIRST PART OF YOUR QUESTION, THE 123 UNCONTROLLED CROSSWALKS THAT ARE -- DON'T HAVE PROPER CONTRAST LIGHTING, THAT IS OUR BACKLOG. DO WE HAVE THE EXPERTISE AND STAFF. WE HAVE Ph.D.s AND SOME OF THE HIGHEST CREDENTIALED STAFFING THAT YOU CAN GET IN THE PROFESSION, BOTH ON THE PLANNING SIDE AND ENGINEERING SIDE. WE HAD A RECRUITMENT FOR VISION ZERO SPECIALIST THAT WAS ONLINE FOR OVER A YEAR. AND WE DIDN'T FIND CANDIDATES. AND AFTER A VERY EXPENSIVE SEARCH THAT WAS RECENTLY TAKEN DOWN. WE MIGHT RELAUNCH IT HERE SOON, BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE TRIED VERY HARD TO RECRUIT FOR SOMEONE WITH KIND OF THAT VISION ZERO EXPERIENCE AND WE WEREN'T ABLE TO FIND SOMEONE.
03:42:15.262: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
03:42:16.330: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: APPRECIATE IT.
03:42:17.264: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WANT TO SAY THAT WE DO HAVE VISION ZERO EXPERTISE ON STAFF, DEFINITELY. AND I GUESS I WON'T CALL OUT THE STAFF MEMBERS, BUT THERE'S SIGNIFICANT EXPERTISE. I DON'T SEE THAT BEING A PROBLEM. I DO WANT TO SAY THAT I HAVE READ ALL OF THE TRANSPORTATION PLAN AT LEAST ONCE, WAS PART OF THE TECHNICAL TEAM. NUMBER FIVE, CROSSWALK SAFETY, ENHANCE SAFETY AND VISIBILITY AT UNCONTROLLED CROSSWALKS. VISIBILITY, THAT MEANS TO BE ABLE TO SEE THROUGH VEGETATION AS WELL AS LIGHTING, AND SO I WOULD LIKE TO ASK THE QUESTION ONE MORE TIME, HOW MANY MARKED, UNCONTROLLED CROSSWALKS HAVE NO ILLUMINATION? NOW WE KNOW THAT WHEN THE STUDENT WAS KILLED, THE CLOSEST STREETLIGHT WAS 132 FEET. SO I WOULD SAY ABOUT 50 FEET. HOW MANY CROSSWALKS THAT ARE MARKED, NOT IN NEIGHBORHOODS, BUT MARKED CROSSWALKS AT UNCONTROLLED LOCATIONS DO NOT HAVE ANY ILLUMINATION. THAT'S MY TOP PRIORITY TO GET THOSE ILLUMINATED. I DON'T CARE IF IT'S POSITIVE CONTRCONTRAST. OR POSITIVE. I'M LOOKING FOR THE ONES IN THE DARK.
03:43:49.723: >> I DON'T HAVE THAT NUMBER AVAILABLE. WE ARE GOING OFF THE 123. SO IT WOULD BE A NUMBER SMALLER THAN THAT. THE 123 WOULD INCLUDE SOME CROSSWALKS THAT HAVE SOME LIGHTING BUT MAYBE NOT POSITIVE CONTRAST LIGHTING. SO THE 123 IS THE TARGET THAT WE ARE AIMING FOR IN TERMS OF MAJOR UNCONTROLLED CROSSWALKS THAT DON'T HAVE SUFFICIENT POSITIVE CONTRAST LIGHTING.
03:44:11.011: >> Councmemb Gswd:  SO THISTHE THREE ONHRHARD ON AND E W PRIORITIZING THE ONES THAT HAVE NO ILLUMINATION FIRST?
03:44:23.757: >> YES, THE THREE ON EHRHARDT IS ON THAT LIST. ONE IS SCHEDULED FOR INSTALLATION BY D.T.E. IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS THE ONE CLOSEST TO CONCORDIA. WE HAVE A PRIORITIZATION MATRIX. WE HAVE -- SIMILAR TO HOW WE PRIORITIZE SIDEWALK GAPS, AREAS THAT HAVE KIND OF THE MOST IMPACT IN TERMS OF, YOU NO HE, PROXIMITY TO -- YOU KNOW, PROXIMITY TO SCHOOLS AND A NUMBER OF OTHER CRITERIA, AND THE AMOUNT OF WORK THAT WE CAN ADVANCE IN THE TIS CAL YEAR.
03:44:55.289: >> Councilmember Griswold: THANK YOU. AND HOPEFULLY I CAN GET THAT NUMBER IN THE NEXT WEEK OR SO.
03:45:00.394: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER DISCH.
03:45:01.395: >> Councilmember Disch: I WANTED TO REITERATE THAT IT LOOKS TO ME AS IF THE ORIGINAL ALLOCATION IN THE BUDGET WAS $135,000 FOR UNCONTROLLED CROSSWALK LIGHTING NEEDS. THE PROPOSED AMENDMENT PRESERVES EXACTLY THAT AMOUNT FOR UNCONTROLLED CROSSWALK LIGHTING NEEDS. SO IF WE ARE ARGUING ABOUT THE PRIORITY THAT NEEDS TO BE ATTACHED TO UNCONTROLLED CROSSWALK LIGHTING NEEDS, IT'S PRESERVED. I WANTED TO RESPOND TO THE THOUGHTFUL COMMENTS OF COUNCILMEMBER, EXCUSE ME, NELSON, AND BY MY CALCULATIONS, CALCULATIONS,THERE'S STILL $50,T WE RETURNED TO THE GENERAL FUND EARLIER AND I WANTED TO -- I THINK I'M PROPOSED AN AMENDMENT TO THE AMENDMENT. BUT I WANTED TO WANTED PROPOSE E STICK THAT 50 INTO THE COMMUNICATIONS FOR EXPLAINING PUBLIC PEDESTRIAN SAFETY. I THOUGH THAT DOESN'T GET US BACK TO 133, BUT IT GETS US AMALMOST HALFWAY THERE. I'M NOT SURE IF I DID THAT RIGHT.
03:46:09.296: >> Mayor Taylor: CAN YOU REPEAT THAT?
03:46:11.198: >> Councilmember Disch: DO I HAVE TO MOVE SOMETHING?
03:46:14.034: >> Mayor Taylor: WHICH 50 ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
03:46:20.174: >> Councilmember Disch: SO WE SPENT 20 OF THE DEER CULL MONEY.
03:46:25.145: >> Mayor Taylor: OH.
03:46:25.713: >> Councilmember Disch: AND WE SPENT ANOTHER 50 ON THE CENTER OF THE CITY -- 40. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 40 -- MY MATH SKILLS! AND THEN WE -- SO WE HAVE 60 ACTUALLY. AND I WOULD -- I WOULD LIKE TO PROPOSE TO PUT THE SIX IN THIS AMOUNT THAT SO I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THE REMAINING 60 FROM THE DEER CULL MONEY AND ADD IT TO THE $60,000 FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND BRING THAT AMOUNT UP TO $75,000, WHICH GETS US MORE THAN HALFWAY BACK TO THE 133.
03:47:01.682: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE A SECOND? IS THAT FRIENDLY TO THE BODY? IT'S FRIENDLY. THE AMENDMENT NOW PROVIDES.
03:47:14.495: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I AM SORRY, NO, IT'S NOT FRIENDLY.
03:47:17.598: >> Councilmember Disch: OKAY.
03:47:18.232: >> Mayor Taylor: ALL RIGHT. TO RESTATE VERY BRIEFLY THE AMENDMENT IS AS DRAFTED WITH THE FOLLOWING EXCEPTION. ADDING $50,000 -- $60,000 SO COMMUNICATIONS EXPLAINING INFRASTRUCTURE-RELATED NATURE OF THE PRODUCTS, THE LAST 60 COMING FROM THE DEER CULL PORTION. IS THAT CORRECT, COUNCILMEMBER DISCH?
03:47:51.198: >> Councilmember Disch: THIS IS CORRECT. THANK YOU.
03:47:54.735: >> Mayor Taylor: MS. BEAUDRY, DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT? MR. CRAWFORD IS THAT PROPERLY STATED? IS THAT PROPERLY STATED? WE HAVE BEEN LEFT TO OUR OWN DEVICES.
03:48:10.651: >> I'M SORRY, COULD YOU REPEAT THAT PLEASE.
03:48:12.352: >> Mayor Taylor: NO WORRIED. MY APOLOGIES.
03:48:20.460: >> Clerk Beaudry: MS. BUSELMEIER HAS EMAILED ME.
03:48:22.896: >> Mayor Taylor: THAT IS CORRECT. SO JUST CONFIRMING THAT THE AMENDMENT NOW AS DRAFTED NOW AS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDMENTED IS AS IDENTICAL AS IT IS PROVIDED THAT WE ARE ADDING AB ADDITIONAL $60,000 FROM GENERAL FUND SOURCES, A/K/A DEER FUND LEFTOVER, AND ADDING THAT $60$60,000 TO COMMUNICATIONS EXPLAINING PEDESTRIAN-RELATED INFRASTRUCTURE PRODUCTS SO THAT 15 WOULD BE 75.
03:48:52.759: >> RIGHT BUT IF WE COULD CHANGE IT TO SAY FROM THE GENERAL FUND TO FUND BALANCE.
03:49:02.936: >> Mayor Taylor: FROM YOUR LIPS TO JACKIE'S FINGERS.
03:49:08.308: >> Clerk Beaudry: YES.
03:49:09.509: >> Mayor Taylor: YES. DOES EVERYONE UNDERSTAND WHAT IT GOING ON SO COUNCILMEMBER DISCH, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR SINCE THIS HAS NOT BEEN DISCUSSED. IF I COULD ASK MY COLLEAGUES TO KEEP THIS ONE SHORT BECAUSE I THINK WE ALL KIND OF KNOW WHAT WE ARE DOING ON THIS ONE. COUNCILMEMBER DISCH.
03:49:29.429: >> Councilmember Disch: I DON'T NEED TO SAY ANYTHING ELSE.
03:49:33.800: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
03:49:34.668: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I GUESS I'M A LITTLE SLOWER THAN MOST. I'M JUST CONCERNED HERE WE ARE MAKING SOME REALLY ON-THE-FLY DECISIONS. WE HAVE A STRUCTURAL DEFICIT, WE ARE CRYING BROKE IN ONE MINUTE AND THEN FLIPPING AND SPENDING $60,000 THE NEXT SECOND. AND IT'S JUST REALLY PUD WILLING AND I'M SURE THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE IN THE PUBLIC WHO ARE SCRATCHING THEIR HEAD, WHAT IS GOING ON HERE? CAN'T WE USE OUR SOURCES OF FUNDING DO. WE NEED TO USE JENNER FUND TOLLARS? THERE ARE OTHER SOURCES OF FUNDING THAT DOESN'T AFFECT OUR GENERAL FUND?
03:50:22.883: >> Mayor Taylor: THAT'S NOT THE AMENDMENT.
03:50:26.753: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: WELL, IN THIS AMENDMENT IS ASKING TO SPEND $60,000 AND I'M SUGGESTING THAT WE TAKE THAT MONEY FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE AND NOT THE GENERAL FUND SO. IT IS GERMANE TO THE DISCUSSION.
03:50:38.732: >> Mayor Taylor: I'M NOT SAYING IT'S NOT GERMANE. YOU ASKED A QUESTION AND I PROVIDED YOU --
03:50:44.171: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I'M ASKING IF MR. CRAWFORD CAN ANSWER THAT, WHETHER THIS $60,000 COULD BE USED -- COULD BE TAKEN FROM A DIFFERENT BUCKET OF MONEY, RATHER THAN THE GENERAL FUND.
03:51:00.053: >> City Admin. Crawford: SURE. OTHER FUNDS COULD BE ELIGIBLE. ALL ROAD FUNDS ARE ALSO -- IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE OBJECTIVE THAT WE HAVE, THEY ARE ALSO A DEFICIT TO OUR NEEDS. WE HAVE A LOT OF NEEDS ACROSS TRANSPORTATION SUSTAINABILITY EVERYWHERE. IT'S NOT JUST --
03:51:15.235: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  CAN WHERE DID THIS $50,000 COME FROM? IS IT ENOUGH? I UNDERSTAND BUT THE AMOUNT, $15,000. HOW DID WE GET TO THAT TO THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE ENOUGH? AND NOW WE ARE -- WE ARE TRIFOLD THAT.
03:51:38.091: >> City Admin. Crawford: DID YOU WANT TO RESPOND TO THAT?
03:51:40.761: >> I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN RESPOND, BUT THAT'S NOT MY FIGURE.
03:51:44.431: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  WE ARE GOING FROM 15 TO 75 IN THE DROP OF A HAT. I MEAN, YOU GUYS CAN VOTE. I KNOW YOU ALREADY SAID YOU KNOW WHERE IT'S GOING AND APPARENTLY PEOPLE KNOW HOW NO COUNT CARDS AND COUNT VOTES I'M NOT ONE OF THEM.
03:52:09.523: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS.
03:52:13.960: >> Councilmember Grand: POINT OF HANDS. THAT WAS DIRECTED AT ME. I GUESS I'M NOT LETTING THAT SLIP.
03:52:23.603: >> Clerk Beaudry: MAYOR, I'M SORRY. IS THERE A SECOND FOR THIS AMENDMENT?
03:52:34.948: >> Mayor Taylor: YES, IT WAS RADINA OR GRISWOLD.
03:52:37.317: >> Councilmember Griswold: RADINA.
03:52:39.886: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS. I.
03:52:41.822: >> Councilmember Briggs: I APPRECIATE COUNCILMEMBER DISCH -- I APPRECIATE MORE FRIENDLY -- STAFF ORIGINALLY RECOMMENDED $133,000 FOR PEDESTRIAN SAFETY OUTREACH AND EDUCATION. I, IN THIS BUDGET AMENDMENT HAD PROPOSED REDUCING THAT TO $15,000. THAT $15,000 CAME FROM REACHING OUT TO A COMMUNICATIONS FIRM IN TOWN AND IDENTIFYING VERY MUCH TO COUNCILMEMBER NELSON'S CONCERN AROUND EDUCATION, COULD YOU COMPILE -- DO WE CONTRACT OUT EVEN AND GET VIDEOS THAT DESCRIBE OUR INFRASTRUCTURE. I THINK THAT'S ONE THE CONCERNS, WHAT IS THE NEW INFRASTRUCTURE AND HOW DO WE USE IT AND WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR OUR COMMUNITIY? WAS TOLD WE COULD PUT TOGETHER MULTIPLE SHORT VIDEOS THAT WOULD EXPLAIN OUR NEW INFRASTRUCTURE AND THAT'S HOW I CAME TO THE $15,000 AMOUNT. ALSO, I JUST -- WHILE I APPRECIATE COUNCILMEMBER GRANDS PRAISE EARLIER, I WANT TO VERY MUCH BE DIFFERENTIAL TO STAFF HERE. I THINK THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY EXPERTS IN OUR COMMUNITY. I'M CONSTANTLY DEFERRING TO THEM. I THINK THEY PRODUCE INCREDIBLE WORK FOR US. I VIEW THIS AS MORE POLICY DIRECTION IN TERMS OF WHERE WE WANT TO PUT OUR LIMITED PRIORITIES AND RESOURCES. WE ARE STRAINED FOR A LOT -- WE ARE STRAINED -- CONSTRAINED ABOUT HOW WE USE THESE AND I'M SIMPLY LOOKING FORWARDS THE DOCUMENTS WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US TO HELP GUIDE THOSE -- GUIDE ME IN RECOMMENDING A BUDGET AMENDMENT. I THINK THAT THEY ARE THE RUNS THAT I TURN TO FOR, YOU KNOW, IMPLEMENTING THIS WORK AND I THINK THEY DO GREAT WORK.
03:54:35.068: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER DISCH.
03:54:36.169: >> Councilmember Disch: I SHOULD HAVE REALIZED THAT IT WASN'T CLEAR. SO I WAS CONCERNED AFTER COUNCILMEMBER NELSON MENTIONED THAT TO WAS CONCERNED THAT $15,000 WOULD NOT BE ENOUGH FOR COMMUNICATION, THE $15,000 IS A REDUCED AMOUNT IN COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS' AMENDMENT TO THE ORIGINAL BUDGET SPENDING. SHE WAS CONSTRAINED BY HOW MUCH WAS IN THE ORIGINAL BUDGET SO THEY RECONTRIBUTED IT AND COMMUNICATIONS -- RECONTRIBUTED IT AND COMMUNICATIONS TOOK THE BIGGEST HIT OF THAT ORIGINAL AMENDMENT AND SO I WAS PROPOSING TO MOVE THE -- SHALL I SAY THE ROAD KILL THAT WAS LEFT OVER FROM THE DEER CULL AMENDMENT. SORRY, IT'S LATE BUT I WANT Y'ALL TO SMILE. AND RESTORE. -- DO A PARTIALIAL RESTORATION OF THE MONIES THAT COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS TOOK OUT SO AS TO REMAIN BUDGET NEUTRAL. I FELT THAT SINCE WE HAD A SURPLUS AND SINCE COUNCILMEMBER NELSON HAD EXPRESSED -- OR COUNCILMEMBER NELSON HAD HEARD THAT COUNCIL EXPRESSED A REAL CONCERN, I WAS TRYING TO RESPOND TO THAT. I'M NOT MAKING A FIVE-FOLD INCREASE. I'M RAISING IT BACK TO A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN HALF OF WHAT IT ORIGINALLY WAS.
03:56:00.520: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE AMENDMENT TO THE AMENDMENT? ROLL CALL VOTE STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER RADINA.
03:56:15.335: >> Councilmember Radina: YES.
03:56:17.237: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
03:56:18.872: >> Councilmember Eyer: YES.

03:56:54.808: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION CARRIES.
03:56:58.812: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE AMENDMENT AS AMENDED. ROLL CALL VOTE STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER RADINA.
03:57:11.958: >> Councilmember Radina: YES.

03:57:41.588: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION CARRIES.
03:57:52.332: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN MOTION AS AMENDED? THAT IS THE BUDGET AS A WHOLE. COUNCILMEMBER GRAND?
03:58:07.781: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. AS THE COUNCIL LIAISON TO THE PARKS ADVISORY COMMITTEE I WAS ASKED IF PARKED WANTS TO BRING FORWARD THE PARKS FAIRNESS RESOLUTION. ARE WE THROUGH ALL AMENDMENTS FOR THIS EVENING?
03:58:22.662: >> Mayor Taylor: WE'RE NOT THROUGH ALL AMENDMENTS. COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS?
03:58:34.441: >> Councilmember Nelson: EXCUSE ME, I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT, BUT MY COMPUTER IS ABOUT TO SHUT DOWN AND I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO INTERACT WITH THE I.T. STAFF TO TRY TO SALVAGE THE SITUATION, BECAUSE THE UPDATE IS GOING TO TAKE A LONG TIME, CAN I HAVE A BREAK SO I CAN GET ON A DIFFERENT DEVICE?
03:58:50.223: >> City Admin. Crawford: COUNCIL MEMBER NELSON AND ANYONE ELSE WHO HAS THAT, STAFF HAS BEEN ROLLING THROUGH THAT. IT ONLY TAKES ABOUT TWO MINUTES. IT WAS A DIFFERENT UPDATE THAN I THOUGHT IT WAS AT THE BEGINNING THE MEETING. SO YOU WILL BE ABLE TO POP BACK ON.
03:59:00.767: >> Councilmember Nelson: OKAY. ALL RIGHT.
03:59:11.411: >> City Admin. Crawford: IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU ARE ABLE TO SUSPEND.
03:59:14.481: >> Councilmember Nelson: OKAY. THANK YOU.
03:59:15.648: >> Mayor Taylor: DO YOU WANT A BREAK OR ARE YOU GOOD TO GO?
03:59:17.450: >> Councilmember Nelson:  IF IT'S -- IF IT'S ONLY LIKE TWO MINUTES, IT'S JUST THAT THE VOTING HAS BEEN FAST AND FURIOUS AND I IT WAS AWKWARD. I HAVE THREE MINUTES REMAINING SO IF I'M OFF FOR TWO MINUTES, I DON'T ON WHAT THAT MEANS. I MEAN, YOU HAVE IT COMING AS WELL, COUNCILMEMBER?
03:59:39.439: >> Councilmember Grand: MINE TOOK ABOUT 60 SECONDS.
03:59:40.807: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: IT'S REAL QUICK. IT'S ON MY OTHER DEVICE.
03:59:48.314: >> City Admin. Crawford: YOU MAY WANT TO TAKE A BREAK AND GO AHEAD AND REBOOT YOUR COMPUTER AND IT WILL CLEAR ITSELF.
03:59:55.822: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I  I APOLOGIZE FOR THE INTERRUPTION.
04:00:01.494: >> Mayor Taylor: LET'S SEE IF WE CAN POWER THROUGH. COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS. YOU ARE ON MUTE.
04:00:12.639: >> Councilmember Briggs: I HAVE TALKED ENOUGH TONIGHT. SO AMENDMENT -- I WOULD PROPOSE MAKING AMENDMENT 10.
04:00:18.645: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE A SECOND? SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER DISCH. COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS?
04:00:25.151: >> City Admin. Crawford: I'M SORRY. THERE WAS A QUESTION ABOUT THIS ITEM, MR. HUPY IS HERE TO ANSWER.
04:00:36.362: >> CAN YOU READ US THE QUESTION?
04:00:50.176: >> City Admin. Crawford: IN MY REBOOT, I HAVE TO GO CHASE IT DOWN. SORRY. DO YOU WANT TO GO AHEAD, MAYOR, I WILL CIRCLE BACK WHEN I HAVE THE QUESTION.
04:01:06.759: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS.
04:01:07.961: >> Councilmember Briggs: SO THIS IS SIMILAR TO -- IT'S SIMILAR IN MOTIVATION, I GUESS TO THE LAST AMEND THAT I PUT FORWARD IN THAT IT'S -- THE GOAL IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE -- WE'RE SHOWING A COMMITMENT IN YEAR ONE OF OUR ADOPTION HOPEFULLY OF OUR NEW COMPREHENSIVE TRANSPORTATION PLAN AND JUST A COUPLE OF THE REALLY KEY PIECES IN IT:  YOU KNOW, WE HAVE A LIST OF SHORT-TERM STRATEGIES THAT ARE IN THE PLAN. YOU KNOW, MULTIPLE PAGES OF THEM. SO I'M NOT SUGGESTING DOING EVERYTHING. I WILL KNOW IT FEELS LIKE IT, BUT THERE ARE A COUPLE OF KEY PIECES THAT ARE RECOMMENDED IN THAT, ONE OF WHICH WAS IN YEAR ONE, UNDER DOING THE TRANSPORTATION PLAN, IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY, THAT ALSO IS SOMETHING THAT WAS IDENTIFIED IN THE YEAR '22C.I.P. AND IDENTIFIED ON THE COMPREHENSIVE TRANSPORTATION PLAN AS SHORT-TERM TARGET TO DEVELOP PLANS FOR THE TIER ONE CORRIDORS ANDIC SENIORS WITHIN YEAR ONE. AND THEN ANOTHER PIECE THAT WAS CALLED OUT VERY SPECIFICALLY WITHIN THE PLAN WAS THAT FOR A SHORT-TERM STRATEGY IS THAT WE NEEDED TO DEVELOP A QUICK BUILD IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM WITH A GOAL OF DOING THREE QUICK SAFETY BUILD PROJECTS A YEAR PRIOR TO THE COURSES AND INTERSECTIONS. THIS IS BASED ON THE DATA AND IN TERMS OF WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT CRASH DATA AND HOW TO ACHIEVE 52 A2ZERO. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE ARE WELL-POSITIONED IF WE HAVE FEDERAL FUNDING COME IN. OR SECURE MUTUAL FUNDS OR FUNDING DOLLARS THAT WE KNOW EXACTLY HOW WE WANT TO PROCEED. SO THIS PROPOSAL IS A $300,000 USE -- ADDITIONAL USE OF OUR MAJOR STREET FUND BALANCE. WHICH IS IN EXCESS OF OUR FUND BALANCE REQUIREMENTS.
04:03:16.189: >> City Admin. Crawford: MAYOR, I HAVE THE QUESTION WHEN YOU ARE READY.
04:03:18.458: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
04:03:19.158: >> City Admin. Crawford: THE QUESTION WAS: -- IT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR -- TO HAVE STAFF EXPLAIN QUICK BUILD PROJECTS. COULD THEY INVOLVE INSTALLING -- INSTALLING UNLIGHTED CROSSWALKS?
04:03:33.372: >> AND I WILL RESPOND TO THAT. THE QUICK BUILD PROJECTS OR WHAT THEY COMMONLY CALL POST AND PAINT. IT WOULD BE DONE WITH PAVEMENT MARKING IN POST. IT MIGHT BE THINGS LIKE WEDGE TURNS OR MAYBE EVEN MANY ROUNDABOUT DONE WITH POST AND PAINT. SO WOULD BE THE QUICK BUILDS. IT WOULD NOT BE GRAY INFRASTRUCTURE NECESSARY. ARE.
04:04:03.970: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS? WELL, THAT'S YOUR THREE MINUTES. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
04:04:10.443: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU. SO I'M JUST CURIOUS HOW YOU CAME UP WITH THE $300,000 NUMBER. IS THAT JUST BY LOOKING AT THE RATIO OF THE REMAINING FUND BALANCE OR JUST SORT OF AN ESTIMATION IN WORKING WITH STAFF AS TO WHAT MOVING FORWARD WITH THE FINAL RESOLVE CLAUSE -- OR THE FIRST RESOLVE CLAUSE WOULD COST? AND I GUESS MY SECOND QUESTION IS, YOU KNOW, THE FINAL WHEREAS CLAUSE THAT -- I MEAN, I ACTUALLY ASKED A BUDGET QUESTION ABOUT THE RATIO OF FUND BALANCES TO EACH DEPARTMENT AND WHERE DO THE FUND BALANCES STAND AND LOOKING AT THE EXCESS OF THE FUND BALANCE REQUIREMENTS, BUT, YOU KNOW, JUST BECAUSE WE HAVE EXCESS THIS YEAR WITH COVID, DOESN'T MEAN WE WILL HAVE THE EXCESS NEXT YEAR. IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A GOOD THING TO RUN DOWN THOSE FUND BALANCES IN MY OPINION. SO I JUST WONDER WHERE THE $300,000 CAME FROM AND I GUESS THE ULTIMATE QUESTION WOULD BE AT THE END OF THIS, AT THE END OF THE NIGHT WHEN THE FINAL BUDGET IS PUT BEFORE US TO VOTE ON, HOW MUCH ARE WE GOING TO HAVE INCREASED OUR PENDING ON INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS AS A TOTAL OVER WHAT WAS, SAY, BUDGETED LAST YEAR OR WHAT WOULD BE -- WELL, THERE'S NO WOULD BE, BECAUSE WE ARE MAKING IT NOW. I'M JUST CURIOUS HOW MUCH EXCESS SPENDING WE ARE GOING TO HAVE ON THESE PROJECTS. SO JUST SOME QUESTIONS. THANK YOU.
04:05:39.465: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS.
04:05:43.069: >> Councilmember Briggs: THE $150,000 FOR THE TRANSPORTATION PLAN UPDATE, THE IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY THAT WAS DRAWN FROM THE NUMBER IN THE C. I.P., $150,000 FOR QUICK BUILD. STAFF THIS WAS NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE AN ESTIMATE ABOUT WHAT THAT COST WOULD LOOK LIKE. THIS IS -- THEY DON'T HAVE PROJECTS NECESSARILY READILY IDENTIFIED ON THIS. SO THIS IS -- ME PROPOSING THE AMOUNT THAT -- YOU KNOW, YOU WOULD EXPECT THAT IF THE STAFF IS NOT ABLE TO GET TO THREE WITH THIS, OR THAT THERE'S AN EXPECTATION THAT THEY MIGHT NEED TO COME BACK AND LET US KNOW AS A COUNCIL, THAT THAT'S THE CASE. AND THEN, YOU KNOW, IN TERMS OF KIND OF WHERE OUR BUDGET IS HEADEDHEADED WHAT THE DIFFERENCS FROM THE LAST FISCAL YEAR, BUT I WOULD SUGGEST VERY MUCH IN LINE WITH OUR CONVERSATION EARLIER AROUND OUR CARBON NEUTRALITY GOALS, THISES STRATEGY FOUR OF OUR CLIMATE ACTION PLAN THAT WE ARE GOING TO REDUCE OUR VEHICLE MILE TRAVELED BY 50%, CAR TRUCKS BY 50% BY 2030. THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN UNLESS WE BUILD INFRASTRUCTURE FOR PEOPLE TO USE. SO THIS IS, I SEE IN LINE. NOT ONLY WITH OUR VISION ZERO GOALS BUT DIRECTLY IN LINE WITH ACCOMPLISHING OUR CARBON NEUTRALITY GOALS.
04:07:07.486: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
04:07:09.255: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I APPRECIATE TRYING TO GET TO OUR GOALS. I REALLY DON'T THINK THIS IS THE WAY WE ARE GOING TO GET THERE. I DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING TO GET MUCH FOR OUR DOLLAR WITH THIS QUICK BUILD. THESE ARE TEMPORARY INSTALLATIONS. THESE ARE NOT PERMANENT FOR THE MOST PART, FROM WHAT I WAS JUST TOLD. THIS CAME TO US LATE. I DIDN'T GET THIS -- I DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO READ THESE AMENDMENTS UNTIL YESTERDAY. WE'RE ASKING TO MOVE AROUND A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF MONEY, AGAINS ON THE FLY WITH A PLAN THAT MOST OF US ARE NOT EVEN FAMILIAR WITH. WE COULD ALWAYS MAKE BUDGET AMENDMENTS MID YEAR ONCE WE HAVE A MORE WELL THOUGHT OUT PLAN. WE'RE JUST -- EARLIER, I HAD ISSUES OF GIVING $60,000 TO ONE OF OUR COMMITTEES TO COME BACK AND EXPLAIN TO US. NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AN AMOUNT THAT IS FIVE TIMES THAT AMOUNT WITH LESS PRESCRIPTION TO IT AND ONE THAT'S GOING TO TAKE AWAY RESOURCES FROM OTHER PROJECTS THAT ARE FALLING BEHIND IN OUR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS. OUR ROADS ARE NOT IN GOOD SHAPE. AND WE HAVE A LOT OF NEEDS AND JUST LIKE COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER SAID, HOW MUCH MONEY NOW ARE WE REDIRECTING TOWARDS PEDESTRIAN SAFETY AND THAT'S NOT TO DIMINISH THE IMPORTANCE OF IT. WE JUST APPROVED AN AMENDMENT OF $320,000, THIS IS ANOTHER $300,000. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT $650,000 A$650,000AWAY FROM STREETS. ARE WE SAVING MONEY IN OUR FUND BALANCES? I KNOW AS WE DO IN OUR ENTERPRISE FUNDS, OUR FUND BALANCE MAY BE ABOVE ITS MINIMUM BUT THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY A BAD THING. ARE WE SAVING UP FOR SOMETHING ABOVE OUR MINIMUM? I APOLOGIZE FOR ASKING THAT --
04:09:12.578: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
04:09:13.479: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  CAN I GET THAT ANSWERED BY THE WAY. HOW MUCH ABOVE OUR MINUTE FD BALAE WE ARE ANDHETHER WE E VING TARDS A MAJ VESTMENT, MAJNFRASTCTURE PROJEC
04:09:33.399: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. PRASCHAN.
04:09:34.867: >> WE ARE ABOUT $1.7 MILLION FOR THE PROJECTED REQUIRED MINIMUM FUND BALANCE IN THE MAJOR STREET FUND. WE ARE NOT IN PARTICULAR SAVING FOR A SPECIFIC PROJECT, WHAT WE DID INTENTIONALLY WAS RESERVE THE MONEY AND PLAN TO SPEND THAT FUND BALANCE IN FISCAL YEAR '23 ON ROAD RESURFACING. SO WE DIDN'T HAVE SPECIFIC PLANS BUT THE THOUGHT WAS THAT THE MONEY WAS LALL LOW INDICATED TO ROAD REPAIR. AND WE WOULD GIVE ENGINEERING TIME TO DESIGN AND PRIORITIZE THE ROADS AT WHICH THEY COULD DO THAT FUNDING.
04:10:11.403: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, MARTI.
04:10:16.976: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
04:10:18.077: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I HAVE A POLICY DISAGREEMENT ON --
04:10:21.647: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCIL MEMBER HAYNER, UNLESS I'M INCORRECT, YOU HAVE ALREADY SPOKE TWICE ON THIS AMENDMENT, AM. I CORRECT ON THAT.
04:10:27.453: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I CAN'T BELIEVE SO.
04:10:30.256: >> Mayor Taylor: ALL RIGHT.
04:10:30.856: >> Councilmember Hayner:  HAVE I?
04:10:33.692: >> Mayor Taylor: I THOUGHT YOU DID. IF YOU TELL ME NO, THEN I HAVE GOTTEN IT INCORRECT.
04:10:38.164: >> Councilmember Hayner:  IT'S POSSIBLE I HAVE. I DON'T THINK SO. I GUESS I WILL BE BRIEF.
04:10:42.668: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
04:10:43.369: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW IF WE WANT TO CREATE -- HOW THIS IS CREATING THESE PUMP OUTS AND THESE CONES AND THE SLOW TURNS WILL SOMEHOW REDUCE -- LEAD TO OUR REDUCTION IN MILES TRAVELED WHILE ON THE OTHER HAND, WE HAVE PEOPLE SUGGESTING THAT WE NEED TO BUILD, BUILD, BUILD AND GET 80,000 NEW UNITS IN THE CITY. I THINK WE ARE AT ODDS WITH OUR PLANS AND I THINK WE SHOULD MAYBE PICK ONE AND STICK TO IT. I DON'T UNDERSTAND CREATING THIS STRUCTURE -- THIS INFRASTRUCTURE CHANGES TO OUR ROADWAY DIRECTLY RESULTS IN REDUCTION OF MILES TRAVELED. I MEAN, PEOPLE CAN WALK NOW. THEY CAN WALK WHEREVER THEY WANT. AND IF WE USE THIS MONEY TO CLOSE SIDEWALK GAPS. THERE'S MORE WALKABILITY IN THE CITY, AND SLOWING DOWN TRAFFIC. I'M NOT SURE THAT I'M ON BOARD WITH THIS THEORY THAT'S RELEADING TO REDUCTION IN MILES TRAVELED. THAT'S ALL I WANTED TO ADD.
04:11:43.829: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
04:11:44.964: >> Councilmember Grand: WHEN PEOPLE LIVE CLOSER TO WHERE THEY WORK, THEY DON'T DRIVE AS MUCH, AND WHEN PEOPLE FEEL SAFER AND MORE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY TEST WAYS FOR PEOPLE TO MOVE MORE COMFORTABLY WHETHER IT BE WALKING OR CYCLING, THAT HELPS US PLAN FOR LONG-TERM INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS I KNOW, I'M NOT AS EXPERTS AS OUR TRANSPORTATION STAFF OR AS DR. BRIGGS WHO I WANTED TO POINT OUT, I BELIEVE WROTE HER DISSERTATION RELATED TO TRANSPORTATION ISSUES BUT, YOU KNOW -- BUT THESE ARE -- THESE ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT PROJECTS. THEY ARE TIED TO MULTIPLE GOALS WITHIN THE CITY, AND WHEN WE LOOK AT WHAT WE ARE SPENDING RELATIVE TO OTHER KINDS OF, YOU KNOW, ROAD REPAIR, I THINK IT'S REASONABLE AND I -- I JUST -- I REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO -- TO HAVE THE CONVERSATION ABOUT ALIGNING OUR FUNDING WITH OUR NEW TRANSPORTATION PLAN. I THINK THAT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY. I UNDERSTAND THAT THE TIMING IS A LITTLE SENSITIVE IN TERMS OF HOW WE DO BUDGET BUT THIS IS HOW WE HAVE ALWAYS DON'T BUDGET. AND I DON'T THINK I HEARD A LOT OF COMPLAINING IN THE PAST WHEN -- WHEN THINGS WERE DONE ON THE FLY. I BELIEVE IT WAS CALLED DELIBERATION OR SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT. FURTHER DISCUSSION.
04:13:19.658: >> Mayor Taylor: ROLL CALL VOTE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER RADINA.
04:13:32.705: >> Councilmember Radina: YES.
04:13:34.540: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
04:13:37.643: >> Councilmember Eyer: YES.
04:13:38.243: >> Councilmember Nelson:  NO.
04:13:44.316: >> Councilmember Briggs: YES.
04:13:44.950: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  NO.
04:13:51.657: >> Councilmember Hayner:
04:14:03.969: >> Mayor Taylor: WE CAN'T HEAR YOU, COUNCILMEMBER.
04:14:05.971: >> Councilmember Hayner:  NO.
04:14:08.474: >> Mayor Taylor: NOW WE GOT YOU.
04:14:13.178: >> Councilmember Disch: NO -- YES. GEEZ, YES. SORRY.
04:14:16.615: >> Councilmember Griswold: NO.
04:14:21.353: >> Councilmember Song: YES. GRAND YES.
04:14:23.722: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION CARRIES.
04:14:26.024: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN MOTION AS AMENDED? I BELIEVE WE HAVE ONE MORE LEFT. COUNCILMEMBER RADINA.
04:14:38.237: >> Councilmember Radina: I'M MOVING AMENDMENT 13 TO REMOVE THE CHIEF STRATEGY EXECUTIVE POSITION. TAMETAME THIS IS MOVED AND SECO.
04:14:59.525: >> Councilmember Radina: WE HAD A GREAT CONVERSATION WITH THE CHIEF ABOUT THIS OVER THE WEEKEND. I HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHY HE VIEWS THIS AS AN IMPORTANT POSITION BUT ULTIMATELY, I -- WHEN LOOKING AT KIND OF STRATEGIES FOR THE CITY, RECOGNIZING THAT WE DO HAVE A DEFICIT THAT WE WOULD BE ADDING AN ADDITIONAL FULL-TIME EMPLOYEE TO OUR LARGEST DEPARTMENT, AND ALSO JUST RECOGNIZING THAT WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF WHAT I WOULD CHARACTERIZES ONGOING COMMUNITY CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE FUTURE OF PUBLIC SAFETY HERE IN ANN ARBOR. I SAW THIS AS AN AREA THAT -- THAT I'M JUST NOT QUITE COMFORTABLE WITH AT THIS POINT, AND SO I -- I WORKED WITH COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS ON THIS. I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK FOR HER BUT THOSE WERE MY REASONS FOR PUTTING THIS FORWARD. AND I DO WANT TO -- WHATEVER LIMITED TIME I HAVE LEFT, IF CHIEF COX WOULD LIKE SOME TIME AS WELL, I DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT HE HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON THIS AS WELL.
04:16:03.522: >> WOULD YOU LIKE ME TALK NOW OR --
04:16:06.124: >> Mayor Taylor: HI, CHIEF.
04:16:09.862: >> SURE. NO. I -- I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY. YOU KNOW, POLICING HAS ALLOT GOING ON RIGHT NOW. MAYBE NINE MONTHS INTO MY TENURE, THROUGH THE LAST BUDGET PRESENTATION, WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE COMMUNITY POLICING, YOU KNOW WHAT ARE ALL THE THINGS YOU NEED TO DO. AND SO I SPENT SOME TIME GOING THROUGH AND TRYING TO TALK ABOUT THAT AND THIS POSITION WAS ONE OF THEM -- ONE OF THE FOUR OR FIVE THAT I ASKED FOR AT THE TIME, TO SAY IN ORDER FOR US, YOU KNOW, FULLY IMPLEMENT IT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE, THAT THIS WAS NEEDED. AND YOU KNOW, THE STRATEGY PIECE OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS FAIRLY IMPORTANT. YOU KNOW, WE TRY TO BE PURPOSEFUL IN WHAT WE DO AND THE CHANGES IN THE CULTURE AND THE OVERALL EXPECTATIONS FROM THE PUBLIC AND THE UNITED STATES AND THE COUNTRY IN GENERAL DEMAND THAT WE DO SOME DIFFERENT THINGS. AND IN ORDER TO DO THOSE, YOU HAVE TO MAKE AN EFFORT TO DO IT. YOU HAVE TO HAVE PEOPLE DO IT AND, YOU KNOW, THE WHOLE DEPARTMENT HAS TO GET IT AND HAVE LIKE A QUALITY ASSURANCE AROUND WHAT WE'RE DOING ON A DAILY BASIS, IN THAT PURPOSEFUL WAY I TALKED ABOUT IT AND THAT'S WHAT THIS POSITION ACTUALLY IS. AND THAT'S WHAT IT'S MEANT TO DO. SO, YOU KNOW, I THINK LONG GONE ARE THE DAYS WHERE, YOU KNOW, WHETHER BIG OR SMALL, THE POLICE DEPARTMENTS CAN CONTINUE TO DO THE SAME THINGS THAT YOU HAVE BEEN DOING. AND WE'RE TRYING TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT AS WELL AS ENHANCE THE COMMUNITY POLICING. SO THAT'S A READER 'S DIGEST VERSION OF WHY I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT.
04:18:01.106: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU CHIEF, COUNCILWOMAN GRISWOLD.
04:18:13.051: >> Councilmember Griswold: ARE YOU SAYING YOU HAVE REDUCED FIVE OFFICERS, AND YOU ARE ADDING THIS POSITION AND SO YOU STILL HAVE A NET REDUCTION OF POUR?
04:18:22.828: >> I GUESS FROM A HEAD COUNT THAT WOULD IT, BUT, AGAIN, THE BUDGET REDUCED THE OFFICE . IF IT WAS UP TO ME, I WOULDN'T REDUCE ANYTHING.
04:18:34.773: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WANTED TO UNDERSTAND THAT. AND ALSO WOULD THIS CHIEF STRATEGY POSITION HELP THE DEPARTMENT MOVE TO NOT ONLY COMMUNITY-BASED POLICING, BUT ALSO HELP WITH THE UNARMED RESPONSE FOR MENTAL HEALTH PURPOSES WHETHER THAT BE WITHIN THE POLICE DEPARTMENT OR ANOTHER ORGANIZATION? I MEAN I KNOW HOW DIFFICULT CHANGE IS AND I'M WONDERING IF THIS IS THE PO, THAT WILL SUPPORT THAT CHANGE.
04:19:09.041: >> WELL, IT WOULD CERTAINLY SUPPORT OUR CHANGE IN GENERAL, I CAN'T SAY THAT WOULD INDIVIDUALLY DO THE UNARMED RESPONSE BUT CERTAINLY HAVING CONVERSATION WITH FOLKS AND PARTNERING WITH PEOPLE TO DO IT MUCH BETTER, ABSOLUTELY. AND THAT WOULD BE THE CASE. YOU KNOW, IN THAT WAY.
04:19:29.428: >> Councilmember Griswold: OH, OKAY. THANK YOU. SO I JUST SEE THIS POSITION AS GETTING TO WHERE THE COMMUNITY HAS REQUESTED THAT WE MOVE TO -- THAT WE CHANGE AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET THAT MOVEMENT WITHOUT SOME ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE.
04:19:50.115: >> WE WOULD NOT GET THAT -- CERTAINLY ANY TIME SOON. I MEAN IT TAKES -- YOU KNOW BEING CHANGE IS DIFFICULT AND IT TAKES, PARTICULARLY CULTURE CHANGE TAKES TIME. IF WE WANT TO EXPEDITE SOME OF THIS AND GET US TO WHERE WE WOULD LIKE TO DO AND BE FAR MORE AGILE, TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE NEEDS WE MIGHT HAVE AND POLICING IN GENERAL, THEN THIS CERTAINLY HELPS US AGRIA IT DEAL. IT HELPS ME A GREAT DEAL.
04:20:22.914: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
04:20:24.282: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANKS FOR COMING OUT AND SAYING THAT. I KNOW WE HAD CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HORROR DEPARTMENT IS MOVING IN WHAT I CONSIDER THE RIGHT DIRECTION. I THINK YOU ARE THE RIGHT PERSON TO -- TO BRING THIS COMMUNITY POLICING TO THE CITY, AND ACT APPROPRIATELY AND I ALSO APPRECIATE COUNCILWOMAN GRISWOLD'S COMMENTS THAT, YOU KNOW, OVERALL POLICE STAFFING IS REDUCED. I KNOW WE GOT SOME EMAILS EARLIER THIS WEEK THAT DIDN'T SEEM FULLY ACCURATE THAT INDEED THE POLICE STAFFING IS GOING DOWN, AND SO, YOU KNOW, THIS POSITION WAS -- WAS ASKED FOR A WHILE BACK AND I THINK IT'S -- I THINK IT'S A CRITICAL POSITION. YOU KNOW, I SUPPORT OUR POLICE AND ESPECIALLY THE DIRECTION THEY ARE EDED WITH THIS AND, YOU KNOW, IN THIS GIVES US AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE DOWN THAT ROAD TO A MORE PUBLIC FACING, YOU KNOW, OUT OF YOUR CARS WALK IN THE STREETS COMMUNITY POLICING, YOU KNOW, UNARMED RESPONSE AND SO ON, ALL THE THINGS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT, I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE, AND IT'S NOT A BUDGET BUSTER FOR ME, SINCE WE'RE LETTING FOUR OR FIVE FOLKS KIND OF SLIDE OUT OF THE BUDGET FROM ATTRITION. SO, YOU KNOW, IT'S A NEW PERSON BUT IT'S LIKE WE ARE GETTING RID OF FOUR PEOPLE. SO I THINK I WILL SUPPORT THIS TONIGHT. MLAWayoraylor: CNCILMEER
04:21:56.308: >>ouilmeeramwi: THANK YOU. ANDORRYO KEEP YOU SO LATE, CHIEF. I APOLOGIZE. I WANTED TO -- I SHOULD HAVE CALLED THIS ONE EARLIER SO YOU DIDN'T TO BE UP SO LATE. WILL THIS POSITION BE A SWORN OFFICER OR A CIVILIAN?
04:22:11.089: >> IT'S A CIVILIAN POSITION, YES.
04:22:17.295: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  YOU KNOW, THERE'S JUST A LOT THAT IS LEFT TO BE UNDERSTOOD ABOUT THIS. I APOLOGIZE, BUT I DON'T THINK MANY OF US  --
04:22:31.409: >> STAY ON I-90 WEST.
04:22:34.212: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: MAYBE YOU ARE DRIVING HOME. BE CAREFUL. [ LAUGHTER ]
04:22:38.049: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  YOU KNOW, IT'S ONE OF THESE THINGS THAT RIGHT NOW BASED ON THE CONVERSATIONS WITH OTHER MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY, I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS CURRENTLY. AND I DON'T WANT THAT TO BE DISCOURAGING TO YOU AND YOUR EXECUTIVE STAFF. I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE A MUCH BETTER EXPLANATION OF WHAT THIS IS, WHAT IT'S GOING TO ACCOMPLISH. I KNOW WE CALLED A LOT ABOUT, IT BUT YET IT STILL ISN'T VERY CLEAR AND EVEN WITH MEMBERS OF ICPOC, STILL THEY ARE NOT -- THEY DON'T FULLY UNDERSTAND THIS. AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT BEFORE WE MOVE FORWARD THAT WE HAVE EVERYBODY ON BOARD. AND RIGHT NOW WE DON'T. AND I WOULD SUGGEST AND ASK THAT ONCE THAT IS -- ONCE WE HAVE MORE TIME FOR THAT, IF THIS DOES NOT GET THE BODY'S SUPPORT THEN THAT YOU COME BACK FOR A BUDGET AMOUNT MID-YEAR OR SOON THEREAFTER TONIGHT. ONCE WE CAN GET FOLKS ON ICPOC COMPARABLE WITH THIS, BUTAND AN- UNFORTUNATELY, I CAN'T SUPPORT IT TONIGHT. I HOPE TO SUPPORT THIS SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE BUT I CAN'T DO IT TONIGHT. I APOLOGIZE FOR NOT GIVING YOU THAT KIND OF SUPPORT HERE TONIGHT, BUT HOPEFULLY SOON I WILL BE ABLE TO.
04:24:19.551: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER SONG.
04:24:22.921: >> Councilmember Song: ACTUALLY, COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI ALREADY HAD -- -- EXPRESSED THE SAME CONCERNS SINCE WE ARE BOTH SERVING ON ICPOC. JUST MAKING SURE THAT COMMISSION IS ON BOARD AND DOESN'T SOUND LIKE THEY ARE PRESENTLY AND SO WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF WORK TO DO.
04:24:42.240: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS.
04:24:43.975: >> Councilmember Briggs: YES, JUST ECHO COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI AND COUNCILMEMBER SONG'S STATEMENTS. I THINK THERE'S JUST -- THERE'S A LITTLE BIT MORE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE BOTH INTERNALLY WITHIN OUR OWN ORGANIZATION AND EXTERNALLY TO MAKE SURE THAT FOLKS REALLY UNDERSTAND NOT ONLY THE POSITION BUT KIND OF UNDERSTAND THE COMMUNITY-ORIENTED POLICING WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF ALL THE CHANGES THAT HAVE HAPPENED IN POLICING AND DEMANDS OUT OF POLICING OVER THE PAST YEAR. I DON'T SAY THIS AS SOMEBODY WHO IS NOT VERY GRATEFUL TOWARDS OUR POLICE DEPARTMENT. AS YOU ALL KNOW,  I HAVE A SON WHO IS GOING INTO POLICING, BUT THIS IS -- WE NEED TO BE VERY THOUGHTFUL ABOUT HAVING THESE CONVERCONVERSATIONS WITH OUR COMMUNICATE AND SEE HOW THIS ALIGNS WITH THE OTHER ITEMS. THE LANDSCAPE HAS CHANGED. YOU READ ARTICLES ABOUT WHETHER COMMUNITY POLICING THE RIGHT MODEL FOR POLICING ANYMORE. I THINK IN CONVERSATIONS WITH CHIEF COX IN TERMS OF HOW HE'S ENVISIONING IT'S VERY MUCH IN LINE AND WHAT I'M HEARING FOLK ASKING FOR, BUT I DO THINK THAT THE CASE NEEDS TO BE MADE VERY PUBLICLY TO OUR COMMUNITY AND THAT CONVERSATION NEEDS TO HAPPEN IN RESPONSE TO THE UNARMED PUBLIC SAFETY RESPONSE. THAT IS -- THE COMMUNITY CALL FOR THAT IS REALLY FOR THAT TO BE EXTERNAL. THE POLICE DEPARTMENT, IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS HOPEFULLY COMPLIMENTING AND RELIEVING SOME OF THE PRESSURE ON POLICING BUT IT'S THIS POSITIONING, CERTAINLY I COULD IMAGINE INTERFACING WITH WHOEVER IT IS LEADING THAT WORK IN THE FUTURE, BUT WOULDN'T BASED ON BEST PRACTICES LEAD THAT WORK. BUT -- THANK YOU.
04:26:34.419: >> Mayor Taylor: I'M SORRY. COUNCILMEMBER RADINA.
04:26:39.591: >> Councilmember Radina: REALLY BRIEFLY. THANK YOU COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI FOR SAYING WHAT I WAS GOING TO ARTICULATE IN MY SECOND PASS AROUND. I THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT TO CLARIFY THAT THE REQUEST FOR THIS WAS A REQUEST FOR A CIVILIAN POSITION. THAT BEING SAID, SIMILAR TO COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI AND COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS, I'M JUST NOT QUITE THERE YET ON THIS. AND SO THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT I CAN'T BE CONVINCED AT A FUTURE DATE THAT THIS POSITION IS REALLY IMPERATIVE TO THE TRANSFORMATIONAL WORK THAT WE NEED TO DO IN THIS -- IN THE DEPARTMENT AND REALLY IN PUBLIC SAFETY IN GENERAL IN THE COMMUNITY, BUT FOR TONIGHT, I WASN'T THERE YET. AND SO THAT WAS REALLY MY PURPOSE FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND I DO APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK YOU DO, CHIEF COX TO THINK ABOUT ALL WE ARE THINKING ABOUT POLICING IN THE CITY.
04:27:32.911: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? I WILL VOTE AGAINST THE AMENDMENT. WE ARE NO THE FOLKS IN THE CITY AND ALL THE VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS HAVE A GREAT DEAL TO DO ALREADY. YOU KNOW, WE HAVE MORE INITIATIVES THAN -- THAN RESOURCES TO MEET THOSE INITIATIVES. WE HAVE MORE IDEAS THAN WE HAVE PEOPLE TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT -- TO DEVELOP THE PLANS THAT UNDERGIRD THEM AND EXPRESS THEM AND THEN THE ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT THEM. WE HAVE, YOU KNOW, A LOT OF DESIRE TO WORK WITH THE POLICE DEPARTMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT -- THAT THE POLICE DEPARTMENT PROVIDES THE SORT OF POLICING THAT -- YOU KNOW THAT THE COMMUNITY IS LOOKING FOR. AND WE HAVE LEADERSHIP WITHIN THE POLICE DEPARTMENT THAT IS COMMITTED TO THAT CONVERSATION, COMMITTED TO THAT TASK, BUT AT THE SAME TIME, THEY HAVE GOT THE -- ALL THE ONGOING BUSINESS AND NEED MORE HANDS. THEY NEED MORE PEOPLE FOCUSING ON FRANKLY STRATEGY AND POLICY WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT. AND THE ADDITION OF A CIVILIAN TO THE LEADERSHIP TEAM STRIKES ME AS A REASONABLE, NON-AGGRESSIVE WAY TO HELP IMPLEMENT THAT GOAL, THAT COMMON GOAL. AND SO I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, TO BE -- THE ADDITION OF THE CIVILIAN, YOU KNOW, C.S.O. IS WISE. AND, YOU KNOW, I -- WELL, I WISH WE WOULD GO FORWARD WITH IT. FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING WITH -- ON THE AMENDMENT, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER RADINA.
04:29:36.534: >> Councilmember Radina: YES.
04:29:39.370: >> Mayor Taylor: NO.
04:29:41.205: >> Councilmember Eyer: YES.
04:29:41.806: >> Councilmember Nelson:  YES.
04:29:47.045: >> Councilmember Briggs: YES.
04:29:48.179: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES.
04:29:53.651: >> Councilmember Hayner:  NO. I'M UNMUTED.
04:30:08.433: >> Councilmember Disch: YES.
04:30:09.033: >> Councilmember Griswold: NO.
04:30:16.074: >> Councilmember Song: YES.
04:30:16.674: >> Councilmember Grand: YES.
04:30:17.275: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION CARRIES.
04:30:19.811: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. IS THAT THE LAST OF OUR SUBSTANTIVE AMENDMENTS THAT WILL BE BROUGHT FORWARD? DO WE HAVE A FAIRNESS NUMBER, MR. CRAWFORD?
04:30:33.458: >> City Admin. Crawford: WE WILL IN JUST A MOMENT, MRS. BUSELMEIER AND PRASCHAN ARE WORKING ON THAT.
04:30:42.800: >> YES, I BELIEVE KIM GAVE JACKIE THE NUMBER.
04:30:51.008: >> Clerk Beaudry: DO YOU WANT ME TO READ THAT? IT WILL STAY THE RESOLVE THE '22 BUDGET BE AMENDED TO INCREASE $76,000.690 TO BE FUNDED AS A ONE-TIME EXPENDITURE FROM THE GENERAL FUND FUND BALANCE. MOVED BY GRAND AND SECONDED BY HAYNER. DISCUSSION EVER AMENDMENT NUMBER 14.
04:31:19.504: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. I SPOKE WITH PARKS LEADERSHIP ABOUT THIS. I KNOW LAST YEAR WITH THE PANDEMIC, WE DID TAKE A HIATUS FROM IMPLEMENTING THIS LONG STANDING PRACTICE. YOU KNOW, AND MR. SMITH FELT THAT WITH THE NEWS OF THE BENTO IN PARTICULAR, THAT IN WEST PARK AND THAT THEY CAN NO LONGER PATCH IT AND NOW THEY WILL HAVE TO HOLD OFF ON SOME OF THOSE EVENTS THIS YEAR. ALL OF THE PHYSICAL BUILDINGS AND PARKS, I BELIEVE, ARE AT LEAST 40 YEARS OLD. SO THERE'S A LOT OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES COMING UP SO WHEN I ASKED IF FORMER PARKS WANTED ME TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS, THE ANSWER WAS RESOUNDING YES DUE TO THE NEEDS IN THE SYSTEM.
04:32:13.925: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
04:32:14.826: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I AGREE WITH COUNCILMEMBER GRAND. WEST PARK BAND SHELL WAS -- WELL, IT WASN'T NECESSARILY A SHOCK BECAUSE ALL OF THAT REROUTING OF WATER BUT IT'S CERTAINLY A DISAPPOINTMENT AND I ACTUALLY HAD SOME PEOPLE IN MY WARD TO OFFER YOU WILL AND BUILD SPONSORSHIPS TO MAKE SURE THAT PROJECT IS RESTORED. SO PUTTING THIS MONEY IN THERE, IT WILL BE WELL SPENT. PARKS HAS BEEN VERY -- I THINK BEEN VERY FRUGAL AND DECENT WITH THEIR SPENDING OVER THE YEARS IN MY EXPERIENCES AND I ENCOURAGE COUNCIL TO SUPPORT THIS AND I WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A COSPONSOR. THANK YOU.
04:32:50.595: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER NELSON?
04:32:54.031: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I HAVE A CLARIFYING QUESTION WAS THAT OVER $650,000?
04:33:02.773: >> City Admin. Crawford: I'M NOT -- IF YOU ARE ASKING ME, I'M NOT CLEAR ON WHAT YOUR QUESTION IS.
04:33:09.280: >> Councilmember Hayner: 76690.
04:33:12.850: >> City Admin. Crawford: THE ADJUSTMENT TO THE PARKS WAS AN INCREASE OF $76,690.
04:33:17.154: >> Councilmember Nelson: OKAY.
04:33:24.629: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I HEARD THAT TOTALLY WRONG. OKAY.
04:33:29.333: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS.
04:33:31.035: >> Councilmember Briggs: I APPRECIATE THE REFERENCE TO THE FIFTH WARD PROJECT. I GUESS I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS AROUND THIS ONE, IF STAFF HAS ANY THOUGHTS ON THE ABILITY TO -- THIS IS $76,000 ENOUGH TO DO WORK LIKE THAT? IF FOR -- IN FISCAL YEAR '22, BUT ALSO MORE BROADLY, A WE INCREASE OUR SUSTAINABILITY FUND FUNDING, WHICH IS WHERE WE ARE IDENTIFYING IT AS CRISIS, HOW DOES THIS -- HOW THIS Z THIS INTERPLAY, WITH THAT, BECAUSE I CAN SEE US DRAWING A LITTLE MORE HEAVILY ON GENERAL FUND TO GET THROUGH OUR SUSTAINABILITY WORK AND I CAN UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE IN THIS RESOLUTION, BUT THERE'S KIND OF SOME UNUSUAL CONSTRAINTS ON THE GENERAL FUND THESE DAYS. JUST SOME GENERAL THOUGHT OPEN THAT WLDE HPFUL FOR ME.
04:34:35.633: >> City Admin. Crawford: DEREK, DO YOU WANT TO TAKE THE FIRST PART OF THE QUESTION. MAYBE I WILL TAKE THE SECOND PART FIRST. IF I UNDERSTAND THE SECOND PART, YOU ARE SAYING -- YOU ARE ASKING WHAT THE IMPACT IS REALLY ON THE FUND BALANCE AS WE GO FORWARD BY HAVING THIS OCCUR. I GUESS I FEEL LIKE I'M BEATING THE SAME DRUM, BUT WE HAVE INSUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO ADDRESS ALL THE ISSUES THAT YOU FACE, ROADS, PARKS, ASSETS, SUN STAINABILITY, YOU KNOW, THE OTHER KIND OF OPERATIONS THAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR. SO EVERY BIT OF FUND BALANCE THAT WE HAVE WHEN WE HAVE A STRUCTURAL DEFICIT IS A PRECIOUS COMMODITY. SO IT'S -- WE SHOULD END THIS YEAR WITH THIS -- IF FISCAL YEAR '22 WITH A SUFFICIENT LEVEL OF FUND BALANCE BUT WE WILL BE IN A DEFICIT. SO IT'S NOT GOING TO FEEL GOOD GOING IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS. WE HAVE A LOT OF PROBLEMS TO SOLVE STILL. DEREK, YOU MAY WANT TO TAKE A SHOT AT THE FIRST PART OF THAT QUESTION IF HEARD IT.
04:35:43.434: >> I WOULD LOVE TO IF I HEARD IT, BUT IF SOMEONE COULD REPEAT IT, I WILL DO MY BEST.
04:35:49.540: >> Councilmember Briggs: I WAS JUST WONDERING WITH THE $76,000, I DON'T KNOW WHAT LEVEL OF WORK IS NEEDED ON, LIKE, FOR EXAMPLE, BAND SHELL VERSUS THE OTHER CAPITAL PROJECTS THAT MIGHT BE OUT THERE. I DIDN'T KNOW IF IT WAS -- WHAT SORTS OF INVESTMENTS WERE NEEDED.
04:36:07.525: >> MUCH MORE THAN $76,000, I CAN ASSURE YOU OF THAT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PRICE TAG ON THE BAND SHELL YET IS. WE DON'T HAVE THAT, BUT I THINK COUNCILMEMBER GRAND POINTED OUT EARLIER, ALL OF PARKS INFRASTRUCTURE AND BUILDINGS ARE REACHING THAT AGE, THAT 40 TO 50 YEAR AGE, WHERE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IS GOING TO BE NEEDED JUST TO HOLD THE LINE AND SIMILAR TO WHAT THE ADMINISTRATOR JUST SAID. THERE'S GO TO BE TOUGH CHOICES EVEN WITH THE $76,000, I CAN ASSURE YOU THERE'S MORE THAN ONE PLACE THAT CAN BE USED IN THE SHORT MATERIAL. SO WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR THE RESOLUTION IN DIFFICULT TIMES WE ARE GRATEFUL THAT -- OR AT LEAST HOPEFULLY THAT IT'S STILL COMING OVER SO WE CAN DO SOME WORK WITH IT. WE USUALLY FROM A STAFF PROCESS, WE USUALLY TAKE -- WE IDENTIFIED OUR PRIORITIZED LIST OF NEEDS TO PACK. PACK DOES A REVIEW OF THOSE AND STAFF MAKES A RECOMMENDATION TO PACK ON HOW BEST TO USE THOSE FUNDS WHERE THEY COULD HAVE THE GREATEST IMPACT.
04:37:12.923: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE. IS THIS A FRIENDLY AMENDMENT? THE AMENDMENT IS FRIENDLY. FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN MOTION. THAT IS TO SAY THE BUDGET AS AMENDED. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
04:37:32.009: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES, THANK YOU TO THE PUBLIC AND TO STAFF FOR BEARING WITH US THE LAST THREE OR FOUR HOURS AS WE WORKED THROUGH THAT. THANK YOU TO COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD FOR MOVING THIS IMPORTANT PART OF OUR AGENDA ITEM SO WE WERE ABLE TO DISCUSS IT VERY THOUGHTFULLY AND CAREFULLY AND I APOLOGIZE IF IT WENT LONG. I AM DISAPPOINTED THAT WE CONTINUE TO IGNORE OUR DEFICIT. WE CONTINUE TO SPEND M.P. AS IF THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM. WE HAVE JUST HEARD FROM THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR RIGHT NOW, MEAN, -- YOU KNOW, FOLKS THAT HAVE JUST JOINED COUNCIL, THERE WILL BE THREE MORE OF THESE MEETINGS THAT YOU WILL BE INVOLVED WITH, AND I THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT HARDER DECISIONS IN THE FUTURE IN THE CHOICES THAT GET MADE. I'M JUST, YOU KNOW, AGAIN, THANKFUL, NOT SURPRISED, AND READY TO MOVE ON.
04:38:38.843: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN MOTION? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
04:38:51.055: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I DIDN'T SUPPORT IT BECAUSE WE DIDN'T CUT ENOUGH. WE DIDN'T FIND ENOUGH NEW REVENUE OR CUT AND I WILL BE ON THE RECORD FOR NOT SUPPORTING IT AND I KNOW MR. CRAWFORD WILL DO WHAT HE CAN TO GET US THROUGH THIS. AND YET WHEN HE COMES TO TELL US THAT WE HAVE TO DO THINGS SO THAT HE AREN'T PUT IN A POSITION BECAUSE OF THE DECISION ULTIMATELY LIES WITH US, WE NEED TO HEED THOSE CONCERNS AND THEY ARE LEGITIMATE CONCERNS. WE CAN'T -- WE CAN'T KEEP GOING DOWN A ROAD WHERE WE ARE MAKING IT HARDER FOR PEOPLE TO AFFORD TO LIVE HERE BECAUSE THEIR TAXES KEEP GOING UP. WE HAVE TO ADD ON MILLAGES FOR THINGS BECAUSE WE DIDN'T MAKE THE ORDER DECISIONS -- WE HAVEN'T PRIORITIZED THE THINGS THAT WE NEED IN BALANCING WITH THE REVENUES THAT WE HAVE. I'M VOTING NO TO THERE ARE. I'M SURE IT WILL PASS. I CAN'T SAY YES TO A BUDGET THAT DOESN'T MAKE THE NECESSARY STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENTS. SO MY APOLOGIES TO MR. CRAWFORD FOR NOT DOING MORE.
04:40:05.596: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS?
04:40:09.667: >> Councilmember Briggs: I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU. SINCERE THANK YOU TO ALL STAFF. THIS IS MY FIRST YEAR. I PEPPERED FOLKS WITH A LOT OF QUESTIONS AND A LOT OF REALLY GOOD INFORMATION THAT REALLY HELPED TO INFORM MY DECISIONS AND I APPRECIATE ALL OF THAT AND I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO -- OBVIOUSY, THERE'S A LOT OF WORK THAT WENT INTO PREPARING THIS BUDGET AND IT'S REALLY, YOU KNOW, WE DISCUSSED AMENDMENTS FOR MULTIPLE HOURS HERE BUT ULTIMATELY THE BASIC SHAPE OF THE BUDGET IS PRETTY SIMILAR TO WHAT IT WAS A COUPLE. HOURS AGO, THAT POINTS TO ALLOTTER OF GOOD WORK ON THE. OF STAFF AND ALSO I WANT TO THANK DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE -- ALL HAVE FOUND PLACES TO GIVE AND MAKE CUTS AND I KNOW THAT THAT MEANS THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE DOING MORE WITH LESS AND THAT WE'RE WORKING HARD TO TRY TO ADVANCE OUR PRIORITIES IN OUR COMMUNITY AND SO I REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK THAT WENT INTO THIS.
04:41:11.729: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. CRAWFORD.
04:41:12.396: >> City Admin. Crawford: THANK YOU FOR INDULGING ONE MORE TIME. ALLOW ME TO THANK THE STAFF AND YOU ALL FOR SITTING THROUGH THESE LONG MEETINGS AND GOING THROUGH THIS PROCESS. IT'S CHALLENGING IN THIS ENVIRONMENT. AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO REMEMBER THAT, YOU KNOW, THE CITY IS -- THIS IS NOT A CITY WITH A LOT OF FAT. THERE'S NOT MUCH AT ALL. IT'S VERY LEAN FOR WHAT WE DO, AND SO THIS IS A VERY CHALLENGING RECEIVE TO OPERATE IN, AND A STATE THAT GENERALLY DOESN'T PROVIDE THE KIND OF RESOURCES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS NEED IN ORDER TO THRIVE AND CREATE A GREAT SENSE OF PLACE. SO I WANTED TO THANK STAFF AND YOU ALL FOR WORKING THROUGH WHAT YOU HAVE DONE HERE. THIS GIVES US A PLAN TO GET TO THE NEXT YEAR AND WE WILL -- WE WILL DO THE BEST WE CAN TO GET THERE. THANK YOU.
04:42:08.052: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
04:42:08.986: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WANT TO THANK STAFF AND IN THE SPIRIT OF ALWAYS TRYING IT IMPROVE THE PROCESS, I WOULD LIKE TO SUGGEST THAT THE ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE CONSIDERS THAT BUDGET AMENDMENTS HAVE THREE COSPONSORS IF NOT A REQUIREMENT, THEN AT LEAST A RECOMMENDATION SO WE DON'T HAVE THREE ALMOST SIMILAR DEER CULL RESOLUTIONS, AND I THINK THAT THAT WOULD INCREASE COLLABORATION BETWEEN COUNCILMEMBERS AND STREAM LINE THE PROCESS BUT ALSO HELP STAFF TO -- TO MEMBER UNDERSTAND THE DIRECTION THAT WE'RE GOING IN. THANK YOU.
04:42:55.432: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? FOR MY PART, I WOULD LIKE TO -- LET ME START MY CLOCK. I WOULD, OF COURSE, LIKE TO THANK STAFF UP AND DOWN THE LINE, MR. CRAWFORD, MS. PRASCHAN, AND ALL THE OTHER AIDS AND OTHER MAGGERS AND PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THE -- MANAGERS AND THE PEOPLE'S INVOLD IN THE PROCESS. IT'S A LONG SLOG AND IT'S FOUNDATIONAL TO EVERYTHING THAT WE DO. AS COUNCILMEMBERS AND MR. CRAWFORD HAVE INDICATED, WE ARE OPERATING IN A RESOURCE SCARCE ENVIRONMENT. OUR NEEDS EXCEED OUR RESOURCES, AGE AND THAT IS THE CONSISTENT, CONSISTENT CHALLENGE FOR MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT IN THE STATE OF MICHIGAN AND WE ARE IN ANN ARBOR, ALTHOUGH, YOU KNOW, I WOULDN'T TRADE OUR TROUBLES FOR ANYONE'S. WE ARE NO EXCEPTION. AND IN THE CONTEXT OF THAT RESOURCE CHALLENGE ENVIRONMENT, THIS BUDGET, YOU KNOW, INCLUDES THE BASIC SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE THROUGH OUR COMMUNITY AND IT ENHANCES THE QUALITY OF LIFE. IT ADDRESSES THE BASICS, CLEAN WATER, WASTEWATER, STORMWATER, POLICE, FIRE AND ALSO PROVIDES FOR PARKS AND ALSO PROVIDES FOR -- FOR ADDITIONAL BENEFITS TO OUR COMMUNITY. IT REFLECTS A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING ACTIVITY THAT WE ARE ABLE TO UNDERTAKE. IT'S A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE, ALBEIT INSUFFICIENT, ULTIMATELY STILL FOR FOR THE TASK IN THE OFFICE OF O.S.I. AND IN FURTHER OUR A2ZERO PROGRAM, AND ANOTHER ONE, WE ARE DOING A LOT OF THINGS IN THE CITY, AND WE -- I THINK IN THE END, THE EFFORT OF STAFF IS -- WELL, I THINK I'M PROUD OF THE WORK WE DO AND THOUGH WE ARE ALL COGNIZANT OF HOW MUCH BETTER IT COULD BE, BUT THAT'S -- THAT'S THE CHALLENGE. FURTHER DISCUSSION. ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER RADINA.

04:51:11.761: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RADINA.
04:51:13.263: >> Councilmember Radina: AS I SHARED EARLIER, I HOPE THIS WILL BE RELATIVELY -- MOVE RELATIVELY QUICKLY. I SHARED AN AMENDMENT OUT EARLIER THIS WEEK SO EVERYONE HAD IT IN ADVANCE. I RESHARED IT WITH THE CLERK. THIS IS ONE THAT WAS ACTUALLY BROUGHT UP TO ME IN CONVERSATIONS WITH MEMBERS OF THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY, AND I APPRECIATE -- I'M SORRY, I WILL MOVE THE AMENDMENT FIRST. AND IT IS AN AMENDMENT TO ADD A NUMBER 18 TO THE FIRST SECTION. WHICH FOR THOSE WHO CANNOT SEE IT AND READ IT, WOULD ADD A SUPPORT AND ADVOCATE TORE CHANGES TO THE MICHIGAN DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS POLICY AND STATE LAW TO REQUIRE THE HOUSING OF TRANSGENDER AND GENDER NON-CONFORMING INDIVIDUALS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR GENDER IDENTITY TO ADDRESS TRANSGENDER INMATES BASED ON THE PRONOUNS OF THEIR CHOICE AND REQUIRE OFFICERS TO SEARCH INMATES BASED ON THE SEARCH POLICY OF THEIR GENDER IDENTITY.
04:52:08.251: >> Mayor Taylor: SECONDED BY. COUNCILMEMBER SONG. COUNCILMEMBER RADINA.
04:52:11.688: >> Councilmember Radina: THANKS. I APOLOGIZE FOR NOT GETTING THIS SOONER. I APPRECIATE THE HARD WORK THAT MY FELLOW POLICY COMMITTEE MEMBERS DID AND THIS IS ONE THAT I HAD -- THAT HAD COME UP AND WAS ADDED TO MY LIST WHEN I WAS TALKING TO MEMBERS OF THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY AND I WANT TO ACTUALLY THANK COMMUNITY MEMBER MICHELLE HUGHES FOR POINTING OUT THAT WHEN SHE WAS REVIEWING IT, THIS ONE HAD NOT MADE THE LIST. I NEGLECTED TO ADD IT DURING OUR CONVERSATIONS. AND I WANTED TO BRING IT FORWARD TO THIS BODY NOW AND I HOPE IT WILL PASS QUICKLY.
04:52:41.651: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THAT FRIENDLY TO THE BODY? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
04:52:46.389: >> Councilmember Hayner: YEAH, NO, THAT WAS FRIENDLY. I'M NOT IN OPPOSITION TO THAT WHATSOEVER. THERE'S SOME THINGS -- THERE'S SOME THINGS IN HERE THAT, YOU KNOW, ARE KIND OF UNUSUAL FOR PUBLIC CONVERSATION KIND OF TOP SICKS FOR US TO -- TOPICS FOR U.
04:53:04.808: >> Mayor Taylor: I'M SORRY, I NEED TO FOLLOW UP WITH THE AMENDMENT. IS IT FRIENDLY TO THE BODY? FRIENDLY. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER. MY APOLOGIES.
04:53:10.513: >> Councilmember Hayner: WELL, I DON'T KNOW WHAT EFFECT THIS WOULD HAVE, BUT I WOULD MOVE TO -- CAN WE DISCUSS THIS -- YOU KNOW, IT'S GETTING QUITE LATE TONIGHT. CAN WE DISCUSS THIS AT OUR JUNE 7th MEETING. I WOULD MOVE TO POSTPONE APPROVAL OF THIS UNTIL OUR JUNE 7th MEETING SO THAT WE CAN LOOK AT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE IN HERE AND HAVE A FURTHER CONVERSATION ABOUT THEM.
04:53:32.569: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE A SECOND? SECONDED BY RAMLAWI. DISCUSSION OF THE POSTPONEMENT. COUNCILMEMBER RADINA.
04:53:42.245: >> Councilmember Radina: I GUESS THIS IS MORE OF A QUESTION FOR STAFF. WE ACTUALLY -- THE POLICY COMMITTEE FINISHED THIS UP A WHILE AGO BUT I THINK THAT THE -- THE PREFERENCE WAS FOR THIS TO HAS ON THE SAME EVENING AS OUR BUDGET. AND SO I JUST -- I WANTED TO THROW THAT OUT THERE TO STAFF TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY REASON WHY THIS WOULD BE PROBLEMATIC.
04:54:04.334: >> City Admin. Crawford: NO. I'M NOT SURE AWARE THAT IT'S HUGELY PROBLEMATIC. YOU ARE RIGHT, WE DO LIKE IT TO GO AT THE SAME TIME, BUT I'M NOT AWARE OF AN ISSUE.
04:54:17.714: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER ON POSTPONEMENT.
04:54:19.582: >> Councilmember Hayner: SURE. I WILL SPEAK MORE SPECIFICALLY. AS ONE EXAMPLE, THERE IS -- WE'RE NOW COMING AROUND TO ADVOCATING FOR THE REMOVAL OF HEADLEY IN PROPER A, AND WE HAVEN'T DONE THAT IN THE PAST YEARS. AND THAT'S A PROBLEM FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE BECAUSE ANN ARBOR IS VERY EXPENSIVE. LIVING IN ANN ARBOR IS VERY EXPENNIVE AND IT'S A BARRIER TO PEOPLE AND OUR HIGH TAXES AND THE HO HIGH VALUE OF OUR PROPERS IS A BARIER. I DON'T SUPPORT US GETTING RID OF HEADLEY AND PROP A. THAT RUNS WHATEVER REMNANTS OF MIDDLE CLASS AND THE LOWER CLASS AND CREATIVE CLASS HAVE MANAGED TO CLING TO HOUSING HERE IN ANN ARBOR RIGHT NOW IF THAT GOES AWAY. THAT WILL RESET ALL THE PROPERTY VALUES AND WE WILL BE IN REAL TROUBLE. YOU THINK YOU HAVE AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS NOW? WAIT UNTIL THAT HAPPENS. I DON'T SUPPORT THE NOTION TO REMOVE HEADLEY. THERE'S THINGSABOUT TERM LIMITS FOR STATE SENATORS AND AID HANDFUL. THINGS RELATED TO POLICIES AND IF EVERYBODY IS READY TO GROW WITH THAT -- I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO THE THING WHERE I'M TRYING TO STRIKE IT OUT AND HAVE THAT CONVERSATION BECAUSE WE HAVE HAD THIS IN FRONT OF US FOR A WHILE. I DON'T SUPPORT THAT WHATSOEVER. I JUST THINK THIS WOULD BE TERRIBLE FOR OUR COMMUNITY. IT MIGHT BE GOOD FROM THE REVENUE STANDPOINT BUT IT WOULD CERTAINLY FINISH THE GENTRIFICATION THAT HAS BEEN STARTED THE LAST TEN YEARS.
04:55:54.978: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RADINA.
04:55:56.346: >> City Admin. Crawford: CAN I COMMENT ON THAT, MAYOR?
04:56:00.083: >> Mayor Taylor: PLEASE.
04:56:00.650: >> City Admin. Crawford: YES, JUST TO MAKE A POINT ON THAT, IF COY COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER. WHETHER IT'S GOOD OR BAD DEPENDS ON WHAT REPLACES IT OR HOW IT'S MODIFIED IN CHANGING. ONE WAY WOULD BE TO JUST RESET EVERYTHING THAT'S ALMOST INCONCEIVABLE AS A METHOD TO MOVE FORWARD TO ME, BUT I WOULD POINT OUT THAT ONE OF THE DRAMATIC IMPACTS IS THAT PEOPLE ARE UP ABLE TO RELOCATE WITHIN THE CITY OR BUY INTO THE CITY, AND SO THAT IS JUST GOING TO CONTINUE TO GET WORSE AS THE MOST RECENT PURCHASER PAYS MOST IN TAXES. AND THE GAP THAT THAT CREATES IS PROBLEMATIC AND YOU RIGHTLY POINT OUT THAT THOSE WHO BENEFIT FROM THE SYSTEM MAY BE CHALLENGED. BUT THERE'S ALL SIDES ARE CHALLENGED HERE. AND SO THE SYSTEM IS NOT WORKING EQUITABLE AT THIS POINT AND SO I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S BEHIND SOME OF THAT COMMENT.
04:57:04.180: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RADINA.
04:57:05.815: >> Councilmember Radina: I WILL ANOTHER NO SUPPORT POSTPONEMENT FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS. ONE THE POLICY COMMITTEE DID PUT SEVERAL MONTHS OF WORK INTO THIS AND I SUPPORT EVERYTHING THAT'S IN IT. THAT'S PART OF MY REASON FOR NOT NEEDING POSTPONE IT, BUT I ALSO -- MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THIS IS ALSO VERY MUCH MEANT TO BE A LIVING DOCUMENT. THIS IS KIND OF OUR GUIDE TO OUR AGENDA UP IN LANSING AND TO THE EXTENT THAT IT DIRECTS OUR LOBBYISTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT, AS WELL. SO THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT THIS CANNOT BE CHANGED IN THE FUTURE. IT IS LIKELY THAT THERE WILL BE ADDITIONS TO IT, IF THERE'S SOMETHING THAT WE DETERMINE PROBLEMATIC AT A FUTURE DATE. WE CAN CERTAINLY REMOVE IT, BUT AT THIS STAGE, I'M COMFORTABLE WITH EVERYTH EVERYTHING IN IT AR EVERYTHING THAT WAS DONE BY POLICY.
04:57:56.599: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE POSTPONEMENT? ROLL CALL? REPRESENTATIVE HAYNER?
04:58:02.305: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I CAN'T SPEAK BUT I WON'T MAKE US GO THROUGH IT. I WOULD IF I COULD WITHDRAW THE REQUEST.
04:58:11.614: >> Mayor Taylor: DOES ANYBODY HAVE AN OBJECTION TO THE WITHDRAW OF THE -- ANYBODY HAVE ANY OBJECTION?
04:58:20.289: >> Councilmember Nelson:  ONCE IT WAS SECONDED, DON'T WE HAVE TO VOTE ON IT?
04:58:23.926: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I BELIEVE YOU ARE RIGHT, COUNCILWOMAN NELSON.
04:58:29.032: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THAT'S MY OBJECTION AS WELL.

05:00:20.977: >> Mayor Taylor: DC-6, RESOLUTION TO APPROVE THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR'S OPERATIONAL ADOPTION OF JUNETEENTH AS A RECOGNIZED AND COMMEMORATED ANNUAL HOLIDAY. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD, AND SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER DISCH. DISCUSSION OF DC-6. I WOULD LIKE TO POP IN AND SAY THAT I'M JUST -- THAT I'M DELIGHTED THIS WILL BE MOVED FORWARD HERE THIS EVENING. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK MR. HAMPTON AND THE NAACP FOR THEIR DECADES LONG CARE AND SUPPORT OF THE JUNETEENTH HOLIDAY HERE IN ANN ARBOR. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK MS. DUCKWORTH AND THEIR IMPORTANT AND ONGOING ADVOCACY IN CONNECTION WITH THIS HOLIDAY AS WELL. WITH PARTICULARITY ON, I WOULD LIKE TO THANK MS. DUCKWORTH, PASTOR DANIELS AND PASTOR POWELL AND FORMER COUNCILMEMBER WOODS FOR THEIR EDITS ON THIS PARTICULAR RESOLUTION WHICH IS NOW FAR BETTER FOR THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS. IN THE END, YOU KNOW, THERE'S SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH DAYS IN THE YEAR TO DO THIS SUBJECT JUSTICE. YOU KNOW, THE HARM OF SLAVERY AND WHITE SUPREMACY PERSISTS. IT WEARS AND IT HARMS OUR AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY, EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM, EVERY SINGLE DAY AND THEY ARE HURT IN AMERICA MICHIGAN, AND IN ANN ARBOR, IS WRENCHING AND PROFOUND. AS TO THEIR STRENGTH AND DIGNITY IN THE PRESENCE OF THAT STRUGGLE. THE STUDY'S FORMAL OBSERVANCE OF JUNETEENTH WILL HAVE A CITY STRUCTURED OPPORTUNITY FOR ANN ARBOR TO JOIN TOGETHER TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE CENTRAL AND PROFOUNDLY SHAMEFUL ROAD RESURFACING ROLE THAT SLAVERY HAS PLACED IN OUR HISTORY AND PRESENT. IT WILL ALSO PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO COME TOGETHER AND RECOGNIZE AND ACT ON THE MORAL IMPERATIVE THAT WE DO ALL WE CAN TO -- DURING THE LEGACY OF RACE-BASED DISCRIMINATION, VIA INSTITUTIONAL AND INDIVIDUAL RACISM THAT CAN BE USED TO PERSIST, THAT EVERY AT EVERY LEVEL OF OUR COMMUNITY. IT WILL BE A DAY FOR US TO COME TOGETHER, A DAY FOR US TO RECOGNIZE WHERE WE HAVE BEEN, AND HOW WE GOT HERE, AND TO STRIVE TO DO BETTER, I THINK IT'S A GOOD WAY OF THINKING AND I'M DELIGHTED IT'S MOVING FORWARD. THANK YOU. COUNCILMEMBER DISCH.
05:03:05.408: >> Councilmember Disch: I WANTED TO THANK EVERYONE AND ESPECIALLY THE LEADERSHIP OF MAYOR TAYLOR ON THIS, BUT I ALSO WANTED TO SAY WHAT MAKES ME EXCITED ABOUT THIS DAY BEING A HOLIDAY, SO I THINK MOST OF US ON THE SCREEN PROBABLY KNOW THIS, BUT ON JUNE 19th, 1865, U.S. ARMY NAVY GORDON GRANGER LANDED IN GALVESTON AND ANNOUNCED THAT ALL OF THEM WERE FREE THAT. OCCURRED TWO MONTHS AFTER THE SURRENDER OF ROBERT E. LEE AND TWO YEARS OF EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION. IT'S A DAY THAT'S RIGHTFULLY CELEBRATED AS A DAY OF LIBERATION BUT IT'S A REMINDER OF THAT EQUALITY BEFORE THE LAW DOESN'T GUARANTEE EQUALITY IN FACT. AND SO I HOPE THAT THIS HOLIDAY, WHICH HAS BEEN CELEBRATED BY THE ANN ARBOR NAACP ANNUALLY SINCE 1994 WILL INSPIRE US TO GATHER TOGETHER AND DO FURTHER WORK AND ACTION TOWARDS THE GOAL OF EQUALITY IMPACT.
05:04:23.652: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER DISCH REMINDS ME THAT I WAS SHAMEFULLY NEGLIGENT IN NOT RECOGNIZING HER WORK HERE, AND COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD AND RADINA AND THE WORK OF STAFF ON GETTING THIS UP OFF THE GROUND. MY THANKS AND APOLOGIES TO EACH AND EVERY ONE. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
05:04:46.642: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. I WON'T BE LONG. THERE'S A LOT THAT CAN BE SAID. I THINK BYPASSING THIS, THIS IS A STEP, BUT THERE'S SO MUCH WORK THAT FEE NEEDING TO BE DONE. THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY WHO DON'T FEEL LIKE AN EQUAL AND THIS IS  A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. UNFORTUNATELY, I WASN'T ABLE TO WORK ON THIS AND BE A PART OF IT. AND I WOULD -- AND I COULD NOT BE ADDED AS A COSPONSOR UNTIL THIS TIME, I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO ADDED AS A COSPONSOR TO THIS, AND I WILL HAVE A LOT MORE TO SAY IN THE NEXT 18 MONTHS. COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
05:05:44.700: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. I WAS THRILLED TO SEE THIS COME FORWARD AND WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A COSPONSOR AS WELL. THANK YOU, EVERYONE, FOR ALL THE WORK THAT WAS DONE.
05:05:57.913: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RADINA.
05:05:59.381: >> Councilmember Radina: I WILL KEEP THIS BRIEF BECAUSE YOU SAID WHAT I WANTED TO SAY ALREADY, MAYOR TAYLOR. I WANTED TO ECHO THANKS FOR THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS, SURVIVORS SPEAK AND THE NAACP FOR THEIR ONGOING ADVOCACY OVER THE YEARS AND THEIR WORK AROUND THIS AND THIS HOLIDAY IN GENERAL. I WAS REALLY EXCITED AND ENTHUSIASTIC TO SUPPORT THIS IN MY PREVIOUS WORK FOR STATE REPRESENTATIVE SIEGLE WHO REPREREPRESENTED BATTLE GREEK. JUNETEENTH WAS CELEBRATED PRETTY WIDELY IN BATTLE CREEK. I WAS EXCITED THAT THIS IS SOMETHING WE COULD FINALLY DO HERE IN ANN ARBOR AS AN OFFICIAL HOLIDAY TO HOPEFULLY BUILD UPON THE -- THE CELEBRATIONS THAT THE NAACP HAS BEEN HOSTING FOR DECADES NOW. BUT I'M ALSO JUST PARTICULARLY GRATEFUL THAT THIS IS COMING AT A TIME WHEN WE CLOSE TO INVEST IN EQUITY TONIGHT BY ACTUALLY UNANIMOUSLY SUPPORTING THE HIRING OF AN EQUITY OFFICER TO CONTINUE MOVING THIS FORWARD BECAUSE WHILE JUNETEENTH, I THINK SERVES AS A REALLY IMPORTANT DAY FOR US AS A COMMUNITY TO REFLECT ON OUR NATION'S HISTORY AND HOW THAT HISTORY CONTINUES TO SHAPE AND INFLUENCE OUR SOCIETY AND CULTURE TODAY, IT IS JUST THAT, A DAY OF EDUCATION, A DAY OF CELEBRATING THE PLAQUE COMMUNITY, AND THE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE TO OUR COMMUNITY BUT IT IS REALLY AS COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI ALLUDED TO, THERE'S SO MUCH MORE WORK THAT STILL NEEDS TO BE DONE. AND I THINK TRUTHFULLY ACKNOWLEDGING OUR CITY AND OUR NATION'S HISTORY OF RACISM AND INEQUALITY IS REALLY CRITICAL TO US OVERCOMING IT. I THINK THINGS LIKE THIS ARE IMPORTANT, BUT WE HAVE A LOT MORE WORK TO DO AND I'M JUST GRATEFUL THAT WE CONTINUE TO MAKE THESE STEPS IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. AND SO THANKS TO EVERYBODY WHO HAS WORKED ON THIS AND THANKS TO THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO BROUGHT IT FORWARD.
05:08:02.705: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
05:08:04.073: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I HOPE WE CAN BE SENSITIVE IN THE WAY THAT WE ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT THIS PLAN, BECAUSE SOME OF OUR DEPARTMENTS WITHIN THE CITY, IF THE WORKER HAVE A DAY OFF DURING THE WEEK, THEN THEY HAVE TO WORK ON SATURDAY. I WOULD HATE TO HAVE SOME OF OUR EMPLOYEES HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN NOT WORKING ON FRIDAY, OR NOT WORKING -- I'M SORRY, OR HAVING TO WORK ON THE ACTUAL JUNETEENTH CELEBRATION, WHEN OTHER PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE OUT CELEBRATING. SO THAT'S MY REQUEST. THANK YOU.
05:08:48.550: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS.
05:08:49.718: >> Councilmember Briggs: I JUST WANTED TO ECHO THANKS TO COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND THE SPONSORS FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. I WOULD LOVE TO BE ADDED AS A COSPONSOR. AND I THINK THIS SERVES AS A REALLY IMPORTANT TOOL FOR EDUCATING OUR COMMUNITY. I KNOW I WAS FAR INTO ADULT LIFE UNTIL THIS. I'M PROUD THAT MY SONS WILL BE MUCH YOUNGER THAN I. THERE'S THAT AND I THINK IT'S IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO ANOTHER DAY OF CELEBRATION WITH JULY JULY 4th AND I THINK THIS IS -- IT'S A DAY TO REFLECT REALLY ON REAL INDEPENDENCE AND WHAT WE SHOULD BE CELEBRATING TOGETHER. AS A NATION AND AS A COMMUNITY.
05:09:43.038: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER EYER.
05:09:44.339: >> Councilmember Eyer: AISLE THRILLED TO SUPPORT THIS AS WELL AND I JUST WANT W WANTED TO BE S A COSPONSOR.
05:09:54.249: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER SONG.
05:09:55.617: >> Councilmember Song: I'M SO GLAD COUNCILMEMBER RADINA SAID WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO BECAUSE WE CAN ALWAYS SIGN UP FOR OURSELVES WITH THE UNITED WAYS EQUITY CHALLENGE THAT SIGNS UP ON JUNETEENTH AND THAT'S TO ASSESS OUR OWN SEVERAL PREJUDICE. I HOPE WE CAN ACCEPT THAT CHALLENGE AND PARTICIPATE AND WE CAN DO THAT. THAT RUNS JUNETEENTH THROUGH JULY 9th. SO IT ALSO COVERS INDEPENDENCE DAY. ALL CONVENIENTLY PACKAGED AND READY FOR YOU TO PARTICIPATE IN.
05:10:35.357: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? OPPOSED? APPROVED. DO WE HAVE A CLOSED SESSION TODAY, MANY POSTEMA?
05:10:48.303: >> Clerk Beaudry: MAYOR, WE -- WE HAVE DC-7.

05:10:55.410: >> Mayor Taylor: DC-7.
05:10:57.212: >> Clerk Beaudry: AND MAYOR, JUST A NOTE THAT THE LAST ONE WAS UNANIMOUS.
05:11:00.149: >> Mayor Taylor: IT WAS. THANK YOU. DC-7, RESOLUTION ESTABLISHING A COUNCIL SUBCOMMITTEE FOR THE PURPOSE OF STUDYING AND SETTING PARAMETERS FOR A PAYMENT IN LIEU OF TAXES (PILOT) PROGRAM FOR THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. TAR. MOVED BY HAYNER AND SECONDED BY RAMLAWI. DISCUSSION OF DC-7. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
05:11:26.809: >> Councilmember Hayner: HOPEFULLY EVERYBODY CAN HEAR ME. I BROUGHT THIS TONIGHT ON A BUDGET NIGHT BECAUSE I'M TRYING TO FIND WAYS TO RAISE REVENUE IN OUR CITY, A A PILOT PROGRAM THAT HAPPENS IN DOZENS AND DOZENS OF OTHER COMMUNITIES AROUND THE COUNTRY, AND HAS FOR YEARS IS ONE WAY TO POTENTIALLY RAISE REVENUE, BUT PERHAPS MORE IMPORTANTLY, IT'S A WAY FOR THE CITY TO ILLUSTRATE THE GOOD SERVICES AND THE GOOD DEEDS AND VALUE THAT NONPROFITS BRING TO THE COMMUNITY. D I DON'T KNOW IF EVERYBODY HAD A CHANCE TO READ SOME OF THE INFORMATION THAT'S WITH IT. IT'S PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD. IT'S A CASUAL SUBCOMMITTEE UNDER THE AUSPICES OF OURITY MINISTRATOR TT THE ASSUTION WLD BE THAT THE CITY AINISTRAT, THE ASSSOR AND D.I.S. FO FOLKS TO DO EXACTY WHAT IT SAYS, THE SUCCESS OF PILOTS IN OTHER COMMUNITIES, AND IDENTIFY LAND VALUE MAPS AND ALL PARCELS IN THE CITIES AND TAKE A LOOK AT NONTAXABLE ENTITIES IN THE CITY. ONE THE THINGS THAT'S UNUSUAL ABOUT THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. THIS IS MODELED ON BOSTON'S SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM, WHICH WAS WORKING SINCE 2010, I BELIEVE, AND WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT THIS FOR A WHILE. AND THE NONPROFITS IN THE STATE OF MICHIGAN GET THEIR TAX EXEMPT STATUS OF 206, OF 1823. AND SO I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE THAT WE REVISIT THE I CANS THAT THAT LAW HAS ON YOU ARE COMMUNICATE WHEN YOU LOOK AT 39, 38% OF THE LAND AREA OF CITY OF ANN ARBOR IS OWNED BY T TAX EXEMPT, OR NONTAXABLE ENTITIES. YOU TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT THE VALUE OF THAT LAND IS AND IN BOSTON'S CASE THEY REDUCED IT IMMEDIATELY BY HALF AND THEN THEY CREATED A LIST OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS THAT DIRECTLY BENEFIT THE RESIDENTS OF BOSTON AND THEY ASK ALL THE NONTAXABLE ENTITIES TO PARTICIPATE AND LIST THEIR GOODS AND THEIR GOODS TO THE COMMUNITY AND IN BOTHON, THERE IN BOSTON, ITRAISES A DECENT AMY FOR THEM AND IT VARIES YEAR-TO-YEAR. THEY HAVE 79% COMPLIANCE WITH THE VOLUNTARY ASK AND I THINK IT'S WORTH LOOKING INTO. I THINK IT'S ANOTHER WAY TO EXPLORE OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS. SO I WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS.
05:14:26.888: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER EYER.
05:14:28.357: >> Councilmember Eyer: GIVEN THE LATE HOUR, AND LATE ADD, I MOVE TO POSTPONE THIS TO OUR NEXT MEETING.
05:14:33.328: >> Mayor Taylor: SECOSECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS. DISCUSSION OF THE POSTPONEMENT? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
05:14:54.049: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER WAS THE COSPONSOR TO ALLOW IT TO BE INCLUDED IN THE AGENDA. I DON'T SEE ANYTHING THAT'S CONTROVERSIAL HERE. I WOULD LIKE TO ASK WHY MY COLLEAGUE BELIEVES THIS SHOULD BE POSTPONED. IT'S ONLY 12:15, AND WE'RE ALMOST DONE. SO I'M PRETTY SURE MOST OF US DIDN'T EXPECT TO GET THIS MEETING DONE BEFORE 1:00 TONIGHT. SO KNOW IT'S LATE BUT THIS IS NOT A BIG HEAVY LIFT HERE.
05:15:31.086: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER ON THE POSTPONEMENT.
05:15:35.090: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  NEW
05:15:35.690: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  NO, I HOPED FOR MY COLLEAGUE TO EXPLAIN WHY THIS WOULD BE POSTPONE.
05:15:46.835: >> Mayor Taylor: THERE WAS A REASON OFFERED AT THE OUTSET FOR THE POSTPONEMENT.
05:15:54.443: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WANT TO THANK MR. CRAWFORD AND THE FOLKS IN THE LEGAL DEPARTMENT FOR HELPING ME PUT THIS TOGETHER. AND I'M NOT SURE HOW IT ENDED UP BEING ON THE AGENDA AS TODAY. FOR SOME REASON, I THOUGHT I WAS SLIPPING IN ON THE AGENDA LAST WEEK. I SEE IT'S DATED TODAY. YES, THAT'S A LATE ADD, BUT I DID FOLLOW THE COUNCIL RULES BY HAVING THREE COUNCILMEMBERS SPONSOR IT. I MEAN, IT'S NOT NOTHING IS HAPPENING. THERE'S NO COST ASSOCIATES WITH THIS. NO BUDGET COST ASSOCIATED WITH THIS. IN FACT, OVER A YEAR OR SO, IT MAY ACTUALLY GENERATE SOME REVENUE. AT THE VERY LEAST, IT WILL PUT INTO PERSPECTIVE OUR RELATIONSHIP. I DON'T THINK IT'S WORTH POSTPONING. I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH IT.
05:16:47.329: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR. IS HE READY TO MEANT ON THIS AND DOES HE NEED MORE INFORMATION TO PREPARE FOR A COMMENT, SAY THE NEXT COUNCIL MEETING OR IS IT SOMETHING RELATIVELY SHORT AND WE CAN JUST MOVE ON?
05:17:08.150: >> City Admin. Crawford: WHETHER IT'S SHORT IS REALLY NOT IN MY COURT. IT DEPENDS HOW MANY QUESTIONS WE HAVE. COUNCICOUNCILMEMBER HAYNER AND E TALKED ABOUT THIS SINCE HE JOINED COUNSEL. IT'S SOMETHING WE TALKED ABOUT OVER THE YEARS.
05:17:34.075: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I REMEMBER IT COMING UP MANY TIMES. I WASN'T SURE IT IF THERE WAS MORE RESEARCH TO DO OR A MATTER OF PROVIDING DIRECTION.
05:17:42.517: >> City Admin. Crawford: THERE'S NO WORK THAT IS -- THERE'S NO WORK BEEN DONE RECENTLY ON THIS. THIS WOULD -- THIS REQUIRES YOUR APPROVAL FOR STAFF TO SPEND TIME IN THIS EFFORT.
05:17:58.300: >> Councilmember Griswold: OKAY. SO YOU ARE NOT GOING TO COULD ANYTHING UNTIL WE PASS A MOTION.
05:18:03.238: >> City Admin. Crawford: CORRECT TO DO THIS RIGHT, IT'S A FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT EFFORT AND COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER BROUGHT IT FORWARD AND SAID, HEY, I WILL BRING A RESOLUTION AND SEE IF I CAN GET THIS ROLL.
05:18:23.525: >> Councilmember Griswold: OKAY. I WOULD DEFER TO COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER IF HE RECOMMENDS POSTPONING IT OR MOVING FORWARD TONIGHT.
05:18:37.505: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER DISCH.
05:18:39.140: >> Councilmember Disch: I'M SORRY. I SHOULD HAVE TURNED INTO SOME QUESTIONS ON THIS AS WELL. I'M JUST WONDER -- YOU USED THE WORE SIGNIFICANT. I'M WONDERING WHICH DEPARTMENTS WOULD BE INVOLVED AND WHICH PRIORITIES WOULD NEED TO BE RESHUFFLED BY THOSE DEPARTMENTS IN ORDER TO ACCOMMODATE THIS EITHER BY DATE THAT'S IN IT OR A DATE LATER IN THIS CALENDAR YEAR AND IS THAT SOMETHING YOU COULD ANSWER NOW OR WOULD YOU NEED TO CONSULT.
05:19:17.078: >> Mayor Taylor: I WOULD NEED TO THINK ABOUT --
05:19:20.181: >> City Admin. Crawford: I WOULD NEED TO THINK ABOUT THAT MORE. UNDERSTANDING THE BREADTH OF IT, THE BACKGROUND WORK AND THEN THE SHARING THAT WITH COUNCIL AND WHAT THAT MEANS AND WHERE THAT STOPS VERSUS IMPLEMENTING. I GUESS I WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT THAT RESOLUTION A LITTLE BIT CLOSER TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT MEANS AND THE TIME COMMITMENT FOR THAT.
05:19:46.875: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
05:19:48.443: >> Councilmember Grand: I THINK THINKING ABOUT STAFF TIME AS BEING NO COST IS REALLY AN IMPORTANT THING TO UNPACK. YOU KNOW, I GET NERVOUS WHEN I HEAR MR. CRAWFORD SAY SIGNIFICANT AS WELL. ESPECIALLY -- LIKE TO COMPARE IT TO BOSTON IS NOT AN APPLES-TO-APPLES. THOSE ARE PRIVATE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS, LARGELY THAT HAVE -- YOU KNOW, WE THINK MICHIGAN HAS A BIG ENDOWMENT. HARVARD HAS A BIGGER ONE. SO IT'S NOT -- I REALLY DON'T THINK THE DIRECTION THAT WE SHOULD BE ASKING STAFF TO GO FORWARD. SO I'M OKAY TO POSTPONE IT TO GET FURTHER INFORMATION BUT I'M ALSO OKAY TO VOTE THIS DOWN BECAUSE I THINK WE NEED TO BE MAKING CHOICES ABOUT HOW STAFF IS SPENDING THEIR TIME AND THIS IS CERTAINLY NOT A PRIORITY FOR ME.
05:20:55.110: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
05:20:55.977: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  YOU KNOW, WE SPENT ALMOST FOUR HOURS TALKING ABOUT OUR BUDGET TONIGHT. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS GERMANE TO OUR DISCUSSIONS TONIGHT, THE PASSAGE OF OVER $450 MILLION BUDGET. THIS COULD ACTUALLY HELP TO OFFSET THE STRUCTURAL DEFICITS THAT WE ARE FACING, AND HE -- COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT CREATIVE WAYS. IF WE DON'T TURN OVER EVERY STONE AND LOOK FOR CREATIVE SOLUTIONS. IT'S JUST FRUSTRATING THAT THE CONVERSATION IS, OH, THIS IS GOING TO TAKE -- WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THAT STAFF TIME IS. AND I THINK MAYBE -- I'M HOPING MR. CRAWFORD CAN BETTER EXPLAIN WHAT SIGNIFICANT MEANS. BUT THAT HAS OBVIOUSLY A CHILLING EFFECT ON COUNCIL'S SUPPORT. BUT THIS IS A VERY, YOU KNOW, I'M SENSITIVE IN WHAT WE ARE DOING TONIGHT. THIS DIRECTLY RELATES TO OUR WHOLE MEETING TONIGHT. AND I KNOW COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER HAS BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT FOR OVER TWO YEARS. AND IT'S JUST DISAPPOINTING THAT THERE IS NOT ENOUGH GIVE AND TAKE. IT IS JUST -- THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE MUCH ROOM IN COMPROMISE. THERE'S POSTPONE FOR WHAT? WHAT ARE WE POSTPONING IT FOR? THERE HASN'T BEEN A GOOD REASON STATED FOR POSTPONEMENT OTHER THAN JUST NOT WILLING TO WORK WITH EACH OTHER. THAT'S HOW I FEEL. I KNOW I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO BE --
05:22:50.291: >> Councilmember Eyer: POINT OF ORDER, MAYOR. POINT OF ORDER.
05:22:52.927: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: IT'S FRUSTRATING FOR SOMEONE IN THE COUNCIL MINORITY JUST TRYING TO SCORE SOME WINS SOMEWHERE.
05:23:00.835: >> Councilmember Eyer: WE SHOULD BE TALKING BOAST PONEMENT.
05:23:04.272: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THERE'S NO POLICY WINS CURRENTLY.
05:23:08.276: >> Councilmember Eyer: WE'RE -- OUR DISCUSSION RIGHT NOW IS SUPPOSED TO BE LIMITED TO WHETHER TO POSTPONE. CERTAINLY NOT EACH OTHER'S MOTIVES. I'M ASKING FOR A RULING ON THE POINT OF ORDER. WE HAVE GOT DISCUSSION THAT'S GOING ON THAT'S NOT RELATED TO POSTPONEMENT AND WE HAVE COUNCILMEMBERS IMPUGNING EX-OTHER MOTIVES.
05:23:38.339: >> Mayor Taylor: A DIDN'T GET A LOT OF MOTIVE AGGRESSION ON THAT. YOU KNOW, THE SUBSTANCE OF THE RESOLUTION, THE RESOLUTION IS GERMANE TO WHETHER OR NOT SOMEONE IS INTERESTED IN POSTPONING OR MOVING FORWARD. COUNCIL MEMBER RAMLAWI, HE WAS REFERRING TO THE URGENCY OF THE RESOLUTION. THE URGENCY OF THE EFFORT TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL REVENUE BY MEANS DESCRIBED. IT IS RELEVANT THAT WE SHOULD KEEP OUR OBSERVATIONS FAIRLY -- ON. [ INAUDIBLE ] TO KEEP IN MINE. COUNCILMEMBER SONG.
05:24:35.930: >> Councilmember Song: SO CAN I ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT THE -- ABOUT THE ACTUAL RESOLUTION OR ARE WE JUST TAKING TIME OPEN POSTPONEMENT?
05:24:47.275: >> Mayor Taylor: IF YOU THI THE QUESTIONS ARE RELEVANT TO QUTISRE RELEVANT TUR WHETHER OR NOT T POSTPON TO ANOTHER DAY, THEN --
05:25:01.022: >> Councilmember Song: OKAY. I UNDERSTAND U OF M, M.S. U. AND WAYNE STATE HAD A PRESS CONFERENCE IN THE 12th PROJECTED CUTS. SO I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS CONVERSATION ASKING FOR FUNDING FROM HIGHER INSTITUTIONS WHO ARE ALSO FACING CUTS AND GOING THROUGH RECOVERY. NOT THAT I DON'T WANT MONEY FROM UNIVERSITY OR DONATE LAND OR BUILD MORE HOUSING, BUT I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND AROUND THE PLANNING ON TASK FORCE IN LIGHT OF THESE CONDITIONS WHERE EVERYONE IS TRYING TO RECOVER FROM THE PANDEMIC. DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?
05:25:51.005: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I DON'T KNOW IF I HAVE TIME TO SPEAK YET. I WOULD IF I COULD.
05:25:58.880: >> Mayor Taylor: LET ME SUGGEST THIS. IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE GETTING HOOKED UP ON POSTPONEMENT, NOT POSTPONEMENT. PEOPLE SEEM TO BE INTERESTED IN ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT THE THING.
05:26:07.155: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I AGREE.
05:26:15.029: >> Mayor Taylor: AND YET WE ARE HERE ON POSTPONEMENT. IF PEOPLE HAVE ANYTHING DIRECT TO TAKE ABOUT THE POSTPONEMENT, OTHERWISE, LET'S VOTE ON THE POSTPONE AND IF IT'S POSTPONED, WE TALK ABOUT IT THE NEXT TIME AND IF NOT, WE TALK ABOUT IT TODAY. DOES ANYONE HAVE ANYTHING DIRECT TO SAY ON THE POSTPONEMENT? I HAVE DISCH AND BRIGGS.
05:26:39.420: >> Councilmember Disch: I WOULD LIKE TO CLARIFY MY REASONING FOR ASKING A POSTPONEMENT AND IT IS THIS. THE ALLOCATION OF STAFF TIME AND PRIORITIES IS LIKE A BIG JIGSAW PUZZLE. AND IT'S A BUDGET. IT'S A A TIME BUDGET. SO PENT A LOT OF TIME DEALING WITH THE MONEY -- WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME DEALING WITH THE MONEY BUDGET. TO THROW A LARGE PROJECT INTO THE MIX MEANS THAT OTHER PRIORITIES HAVE TO YIELD. I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MORE INFORMATION ON WHAT WE WOULD NEED TO YIELD IN ORDER TO ACCOMMODATE THIS. I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MORE INFORMATION ON HOW BIG A PROJECT PEOPLE THINK THIS WILL BE. MR. CRAWFORD SAID THAT HE DOESN'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION, NOR WOULD I EXPC HIM TO HAVE THAT AT HIS FINGERTIPS. I'M NOT ASKING FOR A POSTPONEMENT BECAUSE I DON'T THINK IT'S AI GO A GOOD IDEA ORS COMING FROM SOMEONE WHOSE IDEAS I DISRESPECT. I DON'T THINK IT'S UNREASONABLE TO ASK FOR THE CONSEQUENCES OF ASKING FOR TIME TO BE SHIFTED TO THIS PROJECT. AND I THINK THAT IT IS REASONABLE TO ASK FOR A POSTPONEMENT -- THIS IS UNDOUBTEDLY GERMANE TO THE DISCUSSIONS WE HAD TONIGHT BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S TIME SENSITIVE.
05:28:05.907: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS.
05:28:07.942: >> Councilmember Briggs: I WOULD SUPPORT A POSTPONEMENT, BECAUSE THIS IS ONE OF OUR MOST HEFTY AGENDAS THAT WE HAVE IN A YEAR THERE. SHH A LOT ON IT. THIS WAS A LATE ADD, AND IT'S A SUBSTANTIAL PROGRAM WITH -- THERE ARE SEVEN LINKS ON HERE, I THINK THAT -- NONE OF WHICH I LICKED OCLICKED ON AND READ. I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO BE INFORMED SO I CAN ASK INFORMED QUESTIONS OF STAFF AND OF COUNCILMEMBERS WHEN WE DISCUSS THIS. IT'S 12:30 AT NIGHT AND THIS IS A SUBSTANTIAL PROGRAM THAT WE ARE DISCUSSING. NOW COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER MAY BE THINKING ABOUT THIS FOR A YEAR BUT IT'S FIRST TIME IT'S BEEN INTROINTRODUCED TO THIS COUNCIL. I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT THOUGHTFULLY AND ASK GOOD QUESTIONS.
05:28:59.794: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
05:29:01.529: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I PARTICIPATED IN CONVERSATIONS WITH COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER ABOUT THIS A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO AND AT THE RISK OF EXTENDING THIS CONVERSATION EVEN FURTHER, I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THIS IS LITERALLY, A RESOLUTION ABOUT STARTING A CONVERSATION. SO ANYONE WHO IS SUGGESTING THAT THEY FEEL UNINFORMED ABOUT THE CONVERSATION, THIS IS LITERALLY ABOUT A CONVERSATION. ANYWAY, I I WILL NOT SUPPORT A POSTPONEMENT, ONLY BECAUSE -- WELL -- I'M NOT GOING TO SUPPORT A POSTPONEMENT. THIS IS SO EASY. THIS IS NOT A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF STAFF TIME. THIS IS GOING TO BE AN AMOUNT OF TIME FOR COUNCILMEMBERS TO EXPLORE THIS AND COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IT WILL WORK. THIS IS AN EASY ASK. THIS IS SUCH -- I WILL NOT SUPPORT A POSTPONEMENT. THIS FEELS SILLY.
05:30:25.713: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. CRAWFORD, DID YOU SAY IT WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF STAFF TIME TO UNDERTAKE THIS.
05:30:34.755: >> City Admin. Crawford: I DIDN'T HEAR --
05:30:39.060: >> Mayor Taylor: I HEARD YOU TO SAY THAT COMPLYING WITH THE RESOLVE CLAUSES OF THIS RESOLUTION CONSTITUTE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF STAFF TIME. DID I MISHEAR YOU?
05:30:48.002: >> City Admin. Crawford: I PULLED UP THE RESOLUTION TO REMIND MYSELF. --
05:30:53.441: >> Mayor Taylor: DID YOU SAY THAT.
05:30:54.775: >> City Admin. Crawford: I PULLED IT UP TO LOOK AT THE REQUIREMENTS THAT WE HAVE HERE AND I WAS ASKED AT THE BEGINNING, AM. I PREPARED TO COMMENT ON THAT? I DON'T IN ACTUALLY KNOW -- I NOT TALKED TO STAFF ABOUT WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO EDUCATE COUNCIL ON THE DIFFERENT VALUES OUT THERE. THE LAND VALUE ASSESSMENTS. I'M NOT PREPARED TO ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS YOU HAVE. WHEN I SAID SIGNIFICANT, WHAT I MEANT WAS, YOU KNOW, WE GET A LOT OF QUESTIONS FROM COUNCILMEMBERS. THERE ARE THINGS THAT WE CAN DISPOSE OF WITH RELATIVE EFFICIENCY, YOU KNOW, AN HOUR OR TWO OR LESS, OR MAYBE EVEN 15 MINUTES OR LESS. THIS ONE IS MORE THAN A COUPLE OF HOURS, RIGHT? SO THAT'S -- COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER APPROACHING ME AND SAYING I WOULD LIKE TO DO SOMETHING HERE, I APPRECIATED THAT BECAUSE I THINK IT'S MORE THAN A COUPLE OF HOURS WORTH OF WORK.
05:31:55.836: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND?
05:32:06.447: >> Councilmember Grand: WHEN I LOOK AT THIS, I DON'T READ A CONVERSATION, AND SO I'M ACTUALLY FINE TO VOTE ON POSTPONEMENT BECAUSE I'M -- THIS IS NOT ABOUT WINS OR LOSSES, IT'S ABOUT IS IT READY OR IS IT NOT READY? AND THIS IS A REALLY TROUBLING PATTERN THAT WE CONTINUE TO SEE OF RESOLUTIONS BEING BROUGHT FORWARD, THAT ARE NOT READY AND SO I'M HAPPY TO VOTE NO ON A POSTPONEMENT SO WE CAN -- JUST BECAUSE IT'S BEEN BLOWING AROUND IN YOUR HEAD OR YOU USED A DIFFERENT CADENCE WHEN YOU EXPLAIN TO ME THAT I'M NOT UNDERSTANDING IT. NO, I'M UNDERSTANDING THIS JUST FINE, AND I DON'T THINK THIS IS READY. I ALSO THINK THIS IS HIGHLY UNREALIST AND I DON'T GO CHASING AFTER -- I'M A FAIRLY PRAGMATIC PERSON. BUT LET'S JUST -- LET'S VOTE.
05:33:06.674: >> Mayor Taylor: DISCUSSION OF THE POSTPONEMENT? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE ON THE POSTPONEMENT, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER RADINA.
05:33:17.651: >> Councilmember Radina: YES.
05:33:23.757: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
05:33:25.259: >> Councilmember Eyer: YES.
05:33:25.860: >> Councilmember Nelson:  NO.
05:33:31.098: >> Councilmember Briggs: YES.
05:33:31.732: >> Councilmember Ramlawi NO.
05:33:38.706: >> Councilmember Hayner:  NO.
05:33:45.746: >> Councilmember Disch: YES.
05:33:46.347: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES.
05:33:58.559: >> Councilmember Song: NO.
05:34:03.164: >> Councilmember Grand: I'M SO SORRY, NO.
05:34:08.068: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION CARRIES.
05:34:11.805: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. POSTEMA, DO WE HAVE ANY CLOSED SESSIONS FOR TODAY?
05:34:17.178: >> City Atty. Postema: NO, I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE WISE TO HAVE A CLOSED SESSION. IT'S VERY LATE AND YOU HAVE HAD A LOT OF WORK TO GET THE BUDGET DONE. SO THE ANSWER IS NO.
05:34:27.988: >> Mayor Taylor: WE HAVE US THE CLERK'S REPORT OF COMMUNICATIONS PETITIONS AND REFERRALS. MAY I HAVE APPROVAL OF THE CLERK'S REPORT. MOVED AND SECONDED. DISCUSSION OF THE CLERK'S REPORT? ALL IN FAVOR? OPPOSED. DO WE HAVE COMMUNICATION FROM THE CITY ATTORNEY?
05:34:46.941: >> City Atty. Postema: NO, I JUST GAVE YOU MY COMMUNICATION. THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE MY 19th BUDGET TONIGHT. SO --
05:34:57.518: >> Mayor Taylor: WE NOW COME TO PUBLIC COMMENT. TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT JENNER TOOLE PLEASE ENTER 877-853-5247, 877-853-5247. ONCE YOU ARE CONNECTED PLEASE ENTER MEETING I.D.94212732148. 94212732148. HAVING THEN CONNECTING PRESS STAR NINE. STAR NINE TO INDICATE THAT YOU WISH TO SPEAK. WHEN IT IS YOUR TURN TO SPEAK, OUR CLERK WILL IDENTIFY YOU BY THE LAST THREE DIGITS OF YOUR TELEPHONE NUMBER:  WHEN IT IS YOUR TURN, YOU WILL HAVE THREE MINUTES IN WHICH TO SPEAK. PLEASE PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE TIME. OUR CLERK WILL NOTIFY YOU WHEN 30 SECONDS ARE REMAINING AND WHEN YOUR TIME HAS EXPIRED. WHEN YOUR TIME HAS EXPIRED PLEASE INCLUDE YOUR REMARKS AND CEDE THE FLOOR. IS THERE ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT?
05:36:02.049: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING IN 556. CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING IN 556.
05:36:13.794: >> HELLO, RALPH McKIE, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
05:36:16.563: >> Mayor Taylor: WE CAN.
05:36:17.131: >> I SENT AN EMAIL TO PROVIDE AN OBJECTIVE AND MORE DETAILED ANALYSIS OF THE HEALTHY STREETS SURVEY DATA. HAVING HEARD MR. HESS' COMMENTS TONIGHT, I THINK I UNDERSTAND HIS NUMBERS. THERE ARE THREE CATEGORIES OF COMMENTS, ONE FOR THE PROGRAM, TWO AGAINST AND THREE OTHER. HIS NUMBERS FOR THE FOR THE PROGRAM ARE PRETTY CLOSE TO MINE. THE NUMBERS FOR THE AGAINST ARE WAY LESS. APPARENTLY HE DIDN'T COUNT THE OTHERS. OVERWHOVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF E WERE NEGATIVE. SO THOSE COMMENTERS WERE EFFECTIVELY DISENFRANCHISED. WHETHER THIS WAS DONE INADVERTENTLY OR UNINTENTIONALLY, THE RESULT WAS TO MISCHARTERIZE THE SURVEY RESULTS. SO GOING FORWARD, I DON'T HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF TRUST IN SUMMARIES FROM THE TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT OF SURVEY DATA. THE NEXT DATA ISSUE. COUNCILMEMBERS SAID THAT THE RESIDENTS ON T CLOSED STREET THE RVOESN'T SWSURES. ADDRESSES SO YOU HAVE N WF CHECKING THAT. AND AS I SAID, I DON'T REALLY TRUST THE STAFF DATA ANYMORE. NEXT, THE NEIGHBORHOOD FRIENDLY CLAIM IS MISLEADING. HOW DO OU KNOW, FOR EXAMPLE, WHETHER THE WATER HILL NEIGHBORHOOD SUPPORTS CLOSING SUMMIT WHERE THERE'S ONLY TWO SURVEY RESPONSES THAT SAID THAT? WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD? FURTHER, THIS CLAIM COMPLETELY IGNORES DATA LIKE THE 22-4JEWITT CLOSURE. IT DOESN'T BREAK DOWN WHERE THE 22 RESIDENTS LIVE. SO SO YOUR STATEMENT ABOUT NEIGHBORHOOD FRIENDLY HAS NO FACTUAL SUPPORT. THAT LEADS TO THE NEXT POINT. COUNCILMEMBER EYER'S STATEMENTS THAT THE STREETS ARE FOR ALL OF US. WELL, NOT EXACTLY. CITY RESIDENTS THAT WANT TO DRIVE FROM OS' MUSIC TO ROUSE'S ROAST CAN'T USE ANY NEARBY STREETS TO DO THAT. IF THAT'S YOUR DEFINITION OF PROGRESSIVE, I'M GLAD YOU ARE BEING HONEST ABOUT IT. I WOULDN'T CALL THAT. WE A COUPLE RESIDENTS ON THE STREET CAN PREVENT THEIR NEIGHBORS FROM ONE STREET OVER OR OTHER CITY RESIDENTS OR PEOPLE FROM OUT OF TOWN FROM USING THAT STREET.
05:38:44.244: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
05:38:45.279: >> I WOULD CALL THAT ELITIST, OR REGRESSIVE. IF PEOPLE WANT TO DRIVE THAT STREET WHAT IF THERE'S A BUNCH OF RICH RESIDENTS ON SUNSET THAT DON'T WANT THE NURSES TO DRIVE BY TO GET TO WORK? THAT'S ELITIST. FINALLY, COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS, HOW DO YOU SQUARE YOUR STATEMENT TONIGHT WITH YOUR STATEMENT ON THE BURTON ROAD PROJECT THAT YOU NEED AUTO CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN NEIGHBORHOODS TO PROMOTE EQUITY. THIS IS THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF THAT. GOOD NIGHT.
05:39:15.976: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
05:39:33.727: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING IN 304, DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT? YOU CAN PRESS STAR SIX.
05:39:39.700: >> YES, GREETINGS, ANN ARBORIST. I LIVE IN THE FIRST WARD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, FOR YOUR WORK TONIGHT ON THE BUDGET. MUCH APPRECIATED FOR YOUR VOTES POSITIVELY FOR HEALTHY STREETS AND THE TRANSPORTATION PLAN AND WITHOUT BELABORING THINGS AND REALLY, YOU KNOW, TRYING TO EXTEND YOUR TIME HERE, BUT I WANT YOU TO CONSIDER SOMETHING. IF I WAS TO SHOW UP EVERY OTHER WEEK AND DEMAND FROM ANN ARBOR CITY COUNCIL THAT YOU ENACT A RESOLUTION TO INFORM THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT AND ANY OTHER STATE IN THE MIDDLE EAST WHO SUPPORTS HAMAS AND HEZBOLLAH AND GIVES THEM MONEY AND WEAPONRY TO SHOOT ROCKETS INTO ISRAEL, -- IF I WERE TO DEMAND EVERY OTHER WEEK, THAT YOU CAN COME UP WITH A RESOLUTION TO DISAPPROVE OF THAT, AND THEN STARTED SHOWING UP AT LET'S SAY LOCAL MOSQUES AND DEMANDED THAT THEY ALSO SPONSOR THIS RESOLUTION, HOW DO YOU THINK THAT WOULD GO? I THINK FOLKS WOULD GET PRETTY TIRED OF THAT, IF I SHOWED UP EVERY OTHER WEEK DEMANDING THAT. SO, YOU KNOW, I WOULD LIKE TO JUST SAY TO PEOPLE LIKE BLAINE COLEMAN AND MOZHGAN SAVABIEASFAHANI, AND HERSKOVITZ, GIVE IT A REST. ANN ARBOR CITY COUNCIL CANNOT DO ANYTHING TO STOP THE BLOODSAID THAT IS HAPPENING IN THE MIDDLE EAST RIGHT NOW. AND, YEAH, FINALLY, YOU KNOW, I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY A LITTLE SOMETHING ONCE AGAIN TO MR. HAYNER. MR. HAYNER, REALLY --
05:42:15.722: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
05:42:16.657: >> I JUST GOT TO STOP. YOU JUST GOTTA STOP WITH THE KIND OF COMMENTS THAT YOU HAVE BEEN MAKING. REALLY, THE COMMENTS YOU HAVE BEEN MAKING OR A REAL EMBARRASSMENT TO ANN ARBOR AND AS AN ANN ARBORITE, AND AS A FIRST WARDER, I JUST WISH YOU WOULD RESIGN. THANK YOU AND GOOD NIGHT, EVERYBODY.
05:42:44.584: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
05:42:50.190: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING IN 534, DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT? PRESS STAR SIX TO UNMUTE YOURSELF.
05:43:01.201: >> GOOD EVENING, THIS IS TOM STULBERG CALLING FROM LOWER TOWN. MR. CRAWFORD, THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND PLEASE EXTEND THE THANK YOU TO THE ENTIRE CITY STAFF. THE BUDGET IS NOT AN EASY ISSUE. AND RIGHT NOW, WITH DEFICITS AND THE CURVEBALL THAT COVID HAS THROWN US, WHAT WE ALL WATCHED TONIGHT AND LISTENED TO TONIGHT IS LIKE THE TINIEST LITTLE BIT OF IT. WHAT STAFF HAS HAD TO DO TO CREATE A BUDGET FOR THE CITY, THE 99.9% OF THE WORK THAT WAS DONE, WE ARE NOT SEEING HERE TONIGHT. SO EVERYBODY TAKE A BREATH. WE ARE SEEING THE SMALLEST, TINIEST BIT THAT WE ARE BICKERING OVER. THE MOST OF THE WORK IS ALREADY DONE AND SO WE ARE IN AGREEMENT OVER MOST OF THE WORK. COVID HAS HIT US. COVID IS A COMET THAT WE ARE STARING AT. COVID HAS A LONG TAIL ECONOMICALLY. THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF PAIN FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE. THIS YEAR, NEXT YEAR, AND THE FOLLOWING YEARS. I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT, THAT YOU KNOW, WHEN I HAVE MORE THAN THREE MINUTES WITH ANY OF YOU THAT WANT TO HAVE THAT DISCUSSION, BUT THERE IS GOING TO BE A LOT OF MAIN AND THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF DIFFICULT BUDGET DECISIONS TO COME OVER THE NEXT COMING YEARS, BECAUSE OF COVID. ON TOP OF ANY OTHER ISSUES THAT THERE ARE. SO I REALLY WANT TO THANK ALL THE WORK THAT WENT IN TO BULK OF THE WORK OF CREATING A BUDGET AND I WANT TO THANK AHEAD OF TIME STAFF FOR THE HARD WORK THEY WILL HAVE TO DO NEXT YEAR AND THE YEAR AFTER, AND THE YEAR AFTER THAT. BECAUSE THIS IS NOT GOING TO GO AWAY EASY. AND I WANT EVERYBODY ON COUNCIL -- AND I'M NOT PICKING SIDES. I AM LOOK AT ALL OF YOU, AND TAKE PLEASE TAKE BREATHS AND REALIZE WHAT YOU BICKERED OVER TONIGHT WAS THE SMALLEST, TINIEST PART OF A VERY BIG PICTURE. AND IS THIS REALLY THE FACE YOU WANT TO PRESENT TO THE CITIZENS OF ANN ARBOR. COME TOGETHER, PLEASE. RIGHT NOW PEOPLE --
05:45:34.054: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
05:45:35.155: >> PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PLANET. PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE EAST OR DYING RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE A SERIOUS CONFLICT. THAT'S THE REAL SERIOUS STUFF. WHAT YOU DEALT WITH TONIGHT IS NOTHING COMPARED TO WHAT THEY ARE DEALING WITH AT THIS MOMENT. PLEASE LOOK AT YOURSELVES AND BECOME A MORE FUNCTIONING BODY, A MORE FUNCTIONAL BODY AND TAKE A LEAD FROM YOUR WONDERFUL STAFF WOULD IS DOING ALL OF THIS HARD WORK AND COME TOGETHER, PLEASE. THANK YOU.
05:46:08.521: >> Clerk Beaudry: TIME.
05:46:09.055: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
05:46:15.562: >> Clerk Beaudry: MAYOR YORK SEE ANY OTHER CALLERS WITH THEIR HANDS UP.
05:46:18.632: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT? SEEING NO ONE, PUBLIC COMMENT IS CLOSED. IS THERE COMMENT FROM COUNCIL? COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
05:46:39.719: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WOULD LIKE TO REPEAT TWO REQUESTS THAT I MADE OF STUFF. ONE IS THAT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THE NUMBER OF CROSSWALKS WITHOUT ANY ILLUMINATION WITHIN 50 FEET. AND I'M SURE YOU ARE ALL FAMILIAR WITH THIS BOOK CALLED "RIGHT-OF-WAY." IF YOU ARE NOT PLEASE READ IT. I WANT TO READ ONE SENTENCE. FOLLOWING THE REPLACEMENT OF THE NONFUNCTIONING STREETLIGHTS DETROIT'S PEDESTRIAN DEATH RATE FELL 40% IN JUST TWO YEARS SO I COULD READ MORE. ABOUT EQUITY, ABOUT RACIAL ISSUES. STREET LIGHTS ARE VERY IMPORTANT. BUT I ALSO MADE A REQUEST OF MR. POSTEMA THAT WAS REFERRED TO A STAFF LAWYER AND I HAVE NOT YET RECEIVED THE EMAIL, UNLESS IT'S MISSING SOMEWHERE, AND THAT IS A LEGAL UPON ABOUT HEALTHY STREETS WHERE WE HAD THE MILLAGE TO FILL SIDEWALK GAPS, AND AT THE SAME TIME, WE HAVE A PROGRAM THAT BASICALLY SAYING LET'S SHARE THE STREETS. AND I BELIEVE THAT THAT IS WOULD INCREASE OUR LIABILITY BECAUSE WE CLEARLY IDENTIFIED THAT STREETS ARE DANGEROUS. I HAVE A MICHIGAN MBA. I DO NOT HAVE A Ph.D., BUT THAT MEANS THAT I NEED TO BE VERY OBJECTIVE WITH MY ANALYSIS OF DATA. AND THAT IS WHAT I STRIVE FOR AND THAT IS WHAT I DID TONIGHT. I'M NOT PROGRESSY. THAT'S NOT WHAT DATA IS ABOUT. A DEALOLOGY. THAT'S NOT WHAT -- IDEOLOGY. THAT'S NOT WHAT THE DATA IS ABOUT. YOU LOOK AT THE DATA AND YOU DRAW SOME CONCLUSIONS AS RALPH McKIE DID TONIGHT AND I HOPE WE CAN MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION IN THE FUTURE. AND I ALSO HOPE THAT WE CAN WORK TOGETHER BECAUSE IT'S GETTING REALLY OLD, REALLY, REALLY HOLD WHEN WE CONTINUE -- HOLD WHEN WE CONTINUE TO ATTACK EACH OTHER, ESPECIALLY ONE COUNCILMEMBER, WHEN NONE OF US IS WITHOUT GUILT. THANK YOU.
05:49:07.700: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
05:49:09.202: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: AGAIN, LIKE OUR COMMENTERS WHO CALLED IN SUGGESTED, THAT A LOT OF THIS WORK IS DONE BY STAFF. YOU KNOW, I APOLOGIZE IF ANYTHING I DO OR SAY IS SEEN AS AN EMBARRASSMENT. WE ARE QUIBBNG AND SQUABBLING OVER A FRACTION OF OUR OVERALL BUDGET, BUT I THINK THERE'S SIGNIFICANT POLICY DIFFERENCES IN THOSE -- IN THAT HALF PERCENT OF A HALF PERCENT. I'M NOT TOTALLY SURE WHAT THAT IS. BUT THERE'S ANYTHING DIFFERENCES LYING IN BETWEEN THAMILLION DOLLARS OR LESS. I AGREE WITH RA RALPH McKIE. I THINK WE ARE BECOMING MORE LIKE A GATED COMMUNITYHAN AN INCLUSIVE ONE. I THINK THE FOLKS WOULD WEAR THE BRUNT OF A LOT OF THESE ROAD DIETS AND STREET CLOSURES AND HEALTHY STREETS ARE OF THE WORKING CLASS. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO ARE STUCK IN TRAFFIC, FRUSTRATED, LOSING VALUABLE TIME FROM THEIR FAMILY, LATE TO WORK, ET CETERA. WE ARE BECOMING MORE EXCLUSIVE, NOT INCLUSIVE. THAT'S ONE C COUNCILMEMBER'S TA. THANKS.
05:50:44.731: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
05:50:45.598: >> Councilmember Hayner:  IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE RESOLUTION THAT I BROUGHT THAT THEY VOTED TO POSTPONE UNTIL NEXT WEEK TO PLEASE SEND THEM TO ME. I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANYBODY THROUGH IT. BOSTON IS ONE OF DOZENS AND DOS OF CITIES. A COUPLE YEARS BACK. I HAD CONVERSATION WITH THE ASSESSOR OF BOSTON IN GREAT DETAIL ABOUT THEIR PROGRAM AND THE SUCCESS OF THEIR PROGRAMS AND THE METHODS THEY USE TO DETERMINE IF A PROGRAM WAS EVEN NECESSARY. AND SO I'M KIND OF WELL VERSED ON HOW THEY DID IT AND OTHER COMMUNITIES DID IT AND SO I'M PUTTING IT OUT THERE IF SOMEBODY WANTS TO WORK WITH ME ON THIS, THEY ARE CERTAINLY WELCOME TO BUT PRIOR TO THE JUNE JUNE 7th MEETING. PLEASE FEEL FREE TO SEND QUESTIONS MY WAY OR CALL ME OR WHATEVER AND I WILL DO WHAT I CAN TO BRING YOU UP TO SPEED ON WHAT THIS ASK WHAT, WHICH IS TO SAY, HERE'S WHAT SOME COMMUNITIES DO AND THIS IS WHAT WE MIGHT CONSIDER DOING. IS IT APPROPRIATE, IS IT NOT APPROPRIATE? AND FINALLY HASH IT OUT. LET'S SEE IF WE CAN WORK TOGETHER ON SOMETHING FOR ONCE. THANK YOU.
05:51:56.402: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS.
05:52:07.380: >> Councilmember Briggs: I LIKE TO END THESE MEETINGS ON A POSITIVE NOTE. I THINK WE DEBATED A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT POLICY ISSUES TONIGHT AND WE DID SO PRODUCTIVELY. BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK A LITTLE BIT PERHAPS ON A LESS POSPLESSPOSITIVE NOTE TO WHAT IS TO BE A FUNCTIONAL BODY AND THAT'S NOT TO SUGGEST THAT WE WON'T HAVE POLICY DEBATES AROUND THE TABLE. I HOPE THAT WE DO. I HOPE WE CONTINUE TO DO THAT, BUT I KNOW THAT I RAN AND MANY FOLKS RAN ON NOTIONS OF BUILDING TRUST IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND ENHANCING PROFESSIONAL SIXX AND SHOWING LEADERSHIP AND I -- IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO STAY SILENT WHEN WE SEE A COLLEAGUE MAKING DEFENDING THE USE OF HOMO PHOBIC SLURS AND RACIALLY ABUSIVE LANGUAGE IN OUR NEWSPAPER. AND SUGGESTING -- CERTAINLY WE ALL HAVE FREEDOM SPEECH. THAT'S NOT A POINT UP FOR DEBATE BUT IT REFLECTS UPON THIS BODY. IT REFLECTS TRUST IN GOVERNMENT AND IT CERTAINLY RESPECTS WHEN YOU ARE SPEAKING TO AN AFRICAN AMERICAN PROPERT REPORTER WHEN E LANGUAGE LIKE THAT. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT OUR ADMIN COMMITTEE WORKS THROUGH THIS. BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ME TO PUBLICLY STATE THAT I THOUGHT THAT WAS IT WAS 'EM BARsRY AND IT DID NOT -- IT WAS EMBARRASSING AND IT DID NOT REFLECT WELL.
05:54:06.165: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER.
05:54:06.833: >> Councilmember Grand: AS A MEMBER OF THE ADMIN COMMITTEE, I WILL LIKELY CALL A SPECIAL MEETING THIS WEEK TO DISCUSS WHAT COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS WAS SPEAKING. THE HURT HAS GOT -- THIS IS
