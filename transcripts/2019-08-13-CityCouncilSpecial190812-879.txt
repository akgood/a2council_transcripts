00:01:49.696: >> Mayor Taylor: MAY WE HAVE A MOTION TO APPROVE THE AGENDA. MOVED BY LUMM AND SECONDED BY RAMLAWI. ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] ALL OPPOSED? WE NOW TO PUBLIC COMMENT GENERAL TIME. SPEAKERS HAVE THREE MINUTES IN WHICH TO SPEAK. SO PLEASE PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE TIME CLOSE. AS A MATTER OF THE COURTESY, WE MAY ONLY HAVE ONE PERSON SPEAKING AT A TIME. FINALLY IF YOU REQUIRE ASSISTANCE IN SPEAKING BEFORE COUNCIL TODAY, WE WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO PROVIDE IT TO YOU. IS THERE ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT? PLEASE.
00:02:28.602: >> IT'S KIND OF AMUSING. WELL, MY NAME IS CHUCK LUCKS. I'M A PRIVATE CITIZEN. I'M SPEAKING ON TOP OF MYSELF. I'M THE PERSON WHO PRODUCED THE REPORT ANALYZING THE STATISTICAL CRASH DATA FOR PEDESTRIANS IN THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR FROM THE PERIOD OF 2004 TO 2016. I LOOK AT FIVE CITIES, ANN ARBOR, DETROIT, KALAMAZOO, EAST LANSING, AND GRAND RAPIDS. I PERFORMED A STATISTICAL ANALYSIS, LOOKING AT THE CRASH DATA WITH PEDESTRIANS. THE CONCLUSION WAS THAT AFTER THE PEDESTRIAN SAFETY LAW WENT INTO EFFECT AFTER 2011, THERE WAS A SMALL BUMP UP IN THE NUMBER OF PEDESTRIAN VEHICLE COLLISIONS. THEY WENT UP AND IT STAYED UP THROUGH TO THE END OF 2016. THE EQUATION THAT I PRODUCED WAS PRETTY ACCURATE FOR THE 2016. IT WAS EXTRAPOLATED OUT TO 2016 AND 2018 AND IT WAS PRETTY ACCURATE IN PREDICTING THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF PEDESTRIAN VEHICLE COLLISIONS. I DID SEND A COPY OF THIS REPORT TO ALL THE COUNCILMEMBERS OVER THE WEEKEND. AND I ONLY GOT A RESPONSE BACK FROM MR. SMITH. HE RESPONDED, BUT HE DID NOT RESPOND IN A SUBSTANTIVE WAY, HENCE THE REASON I AM HERE TONIGHT. HE WILL DID EVERYTHING EXCEPT RESPOND TO THE BASIC POINT IN THE REPORT, AND I'M VERY DISTURBED AND UPSET BY THE RESPONSE. THERE WERE A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT HE SAID. HE -- AND IT RAISES A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS. THE LACK OF RESPONSE. HE BASICALLY ATTACKED ME. HE BASICALLY ACCUSED ME OF ATTACKING ERICA BRIGGS WHEN, IN FACT, I HAVE A QUESTION FOR PEOPLE LIKE ERICA BRIGGS WHO HAS BEEN A VERY ACTIVE PUBLIC SPOKESPERSON. SHE'S ON RECORD AS HAVING SAID THAT THIS LAW THIS PEDESTRIAN CROSSING LAW HAS IMPROVED SAFETY WHEN, IN FACT, IT HAS NOT. THAT'S DISINFORMATION. ARE YOU OKAY -- IS THE COUNCIL OKAY WITH SOMEBODY GOING AROUND AND SAYING THINGS THAT AREN'T TRUE AND MISINFORMING THE CITIZENS OF ANN ARBOR? YOU HAVE TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. MR. SMITH STATED THAT HE WANTS TO PROMOTE OR GET AWAY FROM A CERTAIN CAR CULTURE. I WANT TO KNOW FROM HIM IF HE MEANS THAT IT'S OKAY FOR THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR TO ACCEPT A FEW EXTRA CASUALTIES ALONG THE WAY. THAT SEEMS TO BE THE INSINUATION OF WHAT HE'S SAYING FROM THE LOGIC. AND THOSE ARE THE KIND OF QUESTIONS THAT WERE RAISED BY THIS EXCHANGE THAT TOOK PLACE OVER THE WEEKEND. I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO GO OVER THERE AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO GO OVER THE REPORT AND I WOULD APPRECIATE A CHANCE TO DIALOGUE ON THE MATTER. I SPENT A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF TIME PRODUCING THAT REPORT. IT'S BEEN PEER REVIEWED. THE PEOPLE WHO DID PEER REVIEW IT, DID NOT SIGN IT BUT THEY GAVE ME ENOUGH CONFIDENCE THAT THE CONCLUSIONS ARE FAIRLY STATISTICALLY VALID. MY TIME IS UP.
00:05:33.119: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT? SEEING NO ONE, PUBLIC COMMENT IS CLOSED. MAY I HAVE A MOTION TO GO INTO CLOSED SESSION? MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
00:05:46.833: >> City Atty. Postema: AND MAYOR, IT'S UNDER THE OPEN MEETING ACT, IT'S THE TWO LITIGATIONS AND IT'S THE GELMAN CASE AND THE THINK RIGHT STRATEGIES IN FEDERAL COURT.
