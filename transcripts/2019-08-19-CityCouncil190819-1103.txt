ANY OTHER COMMENTS, CONCERNS REGARDING THE AGENDA? ALL IN FAVOR AS AMENDED? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED IN THE AGENDA IS APPROVED. MR. LAZARUS, DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMUNICATIONS THIS EVENING?
00:02:59.224: >> City Admin. Lazarus: I DO MAYOR PRO TEM. JUST A COUPLE OF THINGS QUICKLY. THERE ARE SOME ITEMS ATTACHED TO THE ADMINISTRATOR'S REPORT THAT I THINK ARE OF INTEREST. ONE IS THE MONTHLY CROSSWALK UPDATE, AND THE SECOND IS SOME INFORMATION ON THE COUNTY ROAD COMMISSION, PROJECTS COMMITTEE MEETING THAT LISTS THE PROJECTS WITHIN THE CITY OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. IT'S ASSOCIATED ALSO WITH SOME INFORMATION ABOUT THE RENEWAL OF THE COUNTY ROAD MILLAGE NEXT YEAR. FROM A SAFETY STANDPOINT, YOU WILL ALSO FIND IN THE ADMINISTRATOR'S UPDATE SEVEN-DAY AS WELLAS SOME INFORMATION THATL BE SENDING ABOUT BACK-TO-SCHOOL SAFETY. THIS IS OUR LAST MEETING BEFORE SCHOOL STARTS. SO THAT INTROTO USES THE CAMPAIGN AND ALSO I WOULD LIKE TO INFORM -- INTRODUCES THE CAMPAIGN AND I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO INFORM COUNCILMEMBERS THAT CHIEF COX HAS SOME GREAT IDEAS ABOUT HOW TO INCREASE THE PRESENCE AND AWARENESS OF POLICE OFFICERS FOR ENFORCEMENT DURING THE BACK-TO-SCHOOL WEEK AS WELL. JUST TO GET EVERYBODY BACK AND THE KNOWLEDGE THAT KIDS ARE CROSSING THE STREET AGAIN, AND MERELY ON THEIR WAY TO SCHOOL.
00:04:07.692: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE UPDATE.
00:04:09.694: >> City Admin. Lazarus: OH, IF I COULD. I WANT TO THANK OFFICER BURNETT FOR BEING HERE THIS EVENING AND LEND HIS ASSISTANCE.
00:04:16.501: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE HAVE TWO INTRODUCTIONS TONIGHT FOR NEW CITY ASSESSOR AND CITY TREASURER. BOTH ARE IN THE FINANCE AREA. SO MR. CRAWFORD, CAN YOU PLEASE -- THERE YOU ARE -- COME FORWARD TO THE PODIUM AND INTRODUCE THESE NEW MEMBERS OF YOUR TEAM. THANK YOU.
00:04:33.218: >> THANK YOU. COUNCIL, YOU MAYBE REMEMBER IN THE FINANCIAL AREA, WE HAVE SEVERAL RETIREMENTS THAT HAVE COME UP AND SO WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF A TRANSITION. SO TONIGHT, I'M HAPPY TO -- YOU HAVE ON YOUR AGENDA, ACTUALLY -- BACK UP. LAST MEETING YOU HAD ON YOUR AGENDA, THE APPOINTMENT OF THE JERRY MARKEY AND WASN'T ABLE TO INTRODUCE HIM. HE COMES TO US WITH A LOT OF EXPERIENCE. HE COMES TO US -- HE'S BEEN A COUNTY -- HE WAS MOST RECENTLY THE ASSESSOR IN TAYLOR. BUT GERRY IS HERE TONIGHT. IF YOU COULD -- SO IF YOU SEE HIM WANDERING THE HALLWAYS OR IN HIS OFFICE THIS IS GERRY MARKEY.
00:05:14.259: >> THANK YOU, MAYOR PRO TEM AND COUNCILMEMBERS, AND CITY MANAGERS. I APPRECIATE WORKING WITH YOU AND TOM AND YOUR TAXPAYERS. THANK YOU.
00:05:23.268: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU. WELCOME. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO INTRODUCE MIKE PETTIGREW. MIKE PETTIGREW IS THE DEPUTY TREASURER FOR THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR FOR MANY YEARS AND HE WAS RECENTLY PROMOTED TO TREASURER. MIKE, CAN YOU COME UP?
00:05:43.755: >> HELLO COUNCILMEMBERS AND MAYOR PRO TEM LUMM, THIS IS AN HONOR. I'M VERY GRATEFUL TO EVERYONE, INCLUDING MR. CRAWFORD THAT I CAN TAKE ON THIS RESPONSIBILITY. SO THANK YOU.
00:05:54.766: >> AND I DID WANT TO MENTION MIKE'S RESPONSIBILITIES WILL INCLUDE CUSTOMER SERVICE, TREASURY, PARKING REFEREES, AND RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. SO THANK YOU.
00:06:04.943: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU BOTH. WE NOW COME TO PUBLIC COMMENT RESERVE TIME. PUBLIC COMMENT RESERVE TIME IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO SPEAK TO COUNCIL AND THE COMMUNITY ABOUT MATTERS OF MUNICIPAL INTEREST. TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT RESERVE TIME, ONE NEEDS TO HAVE SIGNED UP IN ADVANCE BY CONTACTING OUR CITY CLERK. SPEAKERS HAVE THREE MINUTES IN WHICH TO SPEAK. SO PLEASE PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE TIME CLOCK. AS A MATTER OF COURTESY, WE MAY ONLY HAVE ONE PERSON SPEAKING AT A TIME, AND SPEAKERS MAY NOT GRANT THEIR RESERVE TIME TO ANOTHER SPEAKER. FINALLY, IF YOU REQUIRE ASSISTANCE WHILE SPEAKING BEFORE COUNCIL, WE WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO PROVIDE IT. ADDITIONALLY, I WOULD JUST ADD THAT WE DO HAVE RULES FOR THIS CHAMBER REGARDING HANDHELD SIGNAGE. AND THIS IS ALSO -- OUR RULES STIPULATE THAT SIGNS NOT BE HELD HIGH, BUT ACTUALLY, THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE DISPLAYED IN THE BACK ROWS. SO THIS IS A POINT OF INFORMATION, AND ALSO TO ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO RESPECT THE SPACE GIVEN OUR PUBLIC SPEAKERS. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ACKNOWLEDGING THAT. OUR FIRST SPEAKER TONIGHT IS MATTHEW -- AND I APOLOGIZE IF I MISPRONOUNCE YOUR SURNAME -- CATANZARITE.
00:07:23.254: >> CLOSE. VERY GOOD. THANK YOU.
00:07:25.156: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU.
00:07:25.957: >> ALL RIGHT. I'M HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT THE GREEN ROAD CONFIGURATION, BUT SOME OF MY COMMENTS WILL ALSO APPLY TO TRAVER WOOD. AND MY NAME IS MATTHEW CATANZARITE, SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE BICYCLING AND WALKINGCOA. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN FOR BRINGING THIS BACK FOR REVIEW. IT BRINGS LITTLE TO KNOW INVESTMENT AND THE SAME APPLIES TO TRAVER WOOD. THESE ROADS WERE REPAVED AND WE WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW THE PAINT WILL GO ON TO THE ROAD. IT'S A LOW-COST WAY TO IMPROVE SAFETY FOR NON-VEHICULAR ROAD USERS. THANK YOU FOR THAT. THE WORK BY THE CITY STAFF AND THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION HAS BEEN VERY THOROUGH, INCLUDES RESPONSES FROM THE PUBLIC IN FAVOR OF THESE CONFIGURATIONS AS WELL, I WILL ADD. IMPROVEMENTS IN THE SAFETIEN ATHE CONNECTIVITY WITH THESE INCLUDE THE BENEFIT, WELL, PARTICULARLY FOR GREEN ROAD, THE PEDESTRIANS CROSSING GREEN ROAD, WILL HAVE TO -- IT SOUNDS INSANE THAT THEY HAVE TO CROSS FIVE LANES OF TRAFFIC, BUT THAT'S AN IMPROVEMENT OVER SIX LANES OF TRAFFIC. THAT'S ONE REALLY GREAT THING FOR ANYBODY THAT EVER HAD TO CROSS THAT ROAD, IF IT'S GOING TO THE MAR MARK OR CVS OR ANY OE MARKETS IN THAT AREA. I WOULD LIKE EVERYBODY TO CONSIDER STADIUM, THERE'S A POST OFFICE ON STADIUM, AND THERE WAS A POSSIBILITY, I BELIEVE IT WAS A ROAD DIET THERE THAT ADDED BICYCLE LANES ALONG STADIUM. SPEAKING FROM EXPERIENCE, THAT HAS BEEN A SUCCESSFUL EFFORT TO INCREASE THE LEVEL OF COMFORT FOR NON-VEHICULAR ROAD USERS, I WOULD SAY. AND THEN ALSO WITH THE NEW DEVELOPMENT, IN THE NORTHEAST PART OF THE ANN ARBOR, THIS PROJECT WILL PROVIDE ALTERNATIVE MEANS OF ACCESS FOR THE HUNDREDS OF HOUSEHOLDS ALONG GREEN ROAD TO GET TO BUSHES, PLUM MARKET AND ANY OF THE OTHER COMMERCIAL RETAIL CENTERS ALONG THAT ROAD. I THINK IT WILL BE VERY IMPORTANT. I KNOW IT'S BEEN BROUGHT UP THAT TRAFFIC IS BAD. THERE'S REAR-END ACCIDENTS. IF WE DO NOTHING, IT STAYS THE SAME AND WE HAVE A BUNCH OF NEW DEVELOPMENTS. SO IT WON'T GET ANY BETTER. SO BY PROVIDING ALTERNATIVE MEANS FOR PEOPLE TO TRAVEL THESE CORRIDORS, OUTSIDE OF VEHICLE, I THINK THAT YOU ARE GOING TO LONG RANGE PREVENT THESE TRAFFIC BACKUPS AND POTENTIAL POSSIBILITIES FOR CRASHES. AND LASTLY, FROM THE STAFF REPORT ON THESE ROAD CONFIGURATIONS, PARTICULARLY GREEN, I BELIEVE IT WAS THE LEVEL OF SERVICE FOR AUTOMOBILE WAS, YOU KNOW, THE DELAYS ARE GOING TO BE INCREASED FROM A LANK OF 7 TO 11 SECONDS, WHICH I BELIEVE A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO GIVE UP FOR THE SAFETY OF EVERYBODY THAT LIVES IN THAT AREA. I THINK IT'S SAD THAT WE PUT A HIGHER VALUE AT THE CONVENIENCE OF DRIVERS IN THESE AREAS VERSUS SAFETY OF NON-VEHICULAR ROAD USERS IN THAT AREA. SO I'M JUST GLAD THAT THIS IS STILL A TOPIC AND I KNOW EVERYBODY HAS PUT A LOT OF EFFORT INTO THINKING ABOUT IT OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS. SO I CONGRATULATE EVERYBODY FOR KEEPING THIS FRESH AND HAVING IT BE SOMETHING THAT WE CONSIDER, AS OPPOSED TO IT KIND OF DYING OUT AND COMING BACK AS ANOTHER PROJECT. LOW COST, GREAT, SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS.
00:10:40.017: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS BLAINE COLEMAN.
00:10:49.961: >> THIS IS CITY COUNCIL -- THIS CITY COUNCIL DEALS WITH GLOBAL AND NATIONAL ISSUES ALL THE TIME. THIS CITY COUNCIL IS NOW DEALING WITH GLOBAL CLIMATE ISSUES ALL THE TIME. THIS CITY COUNCIL THIS YEAR UNANIMOUSLY PASSED A RESOLUTION TO BOYCOTT WENDY'S FOR THE SAKE OF FARM WORKERS. THAT'S A GOOD THING. THIS CITY COUNCIL HAS VOTED TO BOYCOTT BURMA FOR HUMAN RIGHTS REASONS. THIS CITY HAS VOTED TO BOYCOTT SOUTH AFRICA FOR HUMAN RIGHTS REASONS AND THIS CITY COUNCIL CAN NEVER, EVER, USE THE EXCUSE THAT IT CONCERNS ITSELF ONLY WITH THE CITY LIMITS OF ANN ARBOR. THAT IS DEMONSTRABLY UNTRUE. AND TO ADD TO THAT FACT IS CITY ATTORNEY POSTEMA, WHO HAS JUST REPORTED IN MLIVE SAYING, YES THE CITY COUNCIL HAS THE RIGHT TO VOTE ON A RESOLUTION FAVORING CUTOFF OF MILITARY AID TO ISRAEL. CITY COUNCIL HAS THAT AUTHORITY. THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. CITY COUNCIL HAS DONE MANY SIMILAR THINGS AND NOW THE CITY ATTORNEY IS CONFIRMING YES, YOU, THE CITY COUNCIL, HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO VOTE ON A RESOLUTION TO FAVOR CUTTING OFF MILITARY AID TO ISRAEL. IT'S A SIMPLE RESOLUTION. WE ARE AGAINST MILITARY AID TO ISRAEL. SIMPLE AND IF YOU FORGET IT, LOOK AT YOUR AGENDA TONIGHT. IT'S RIGHT ON THE SUBJECT LINE OF MY TALK. THE OTHER ARGUMENT WE HAVE HEARD AGAINST THIS RESOLUTION IS THAT IT'S JUST TOO COMPLEX. COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN HAS MADE THE ARGUMENT THAT IT'S JUST TOO COMPLEX. NOW, HE'S AN EDUCATED MICHIGAN MAN, AND HE SAYS IT'S JUST TOO COMPLEX. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT ARGUMENT AND WHEN HE THINKS ABOUT IT, HE WON'T EITHER. IT'S NOT A GOOD ARGUMENT. THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSIONER A FEW DAYS AGO MADE THE SAME ARGUMENT, ALSO A HIGHLY EDUCATED PERSON FR FROM A PRESTIGIOUS INSTITUTION THAT. HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSIONER MADE THE SAME ARGUMENTS SAYING, QUOTE, I AM NOT INTELLIGENT ENOUGH TO ANALYZE COMPLEX FOREIGN POLICY ISSUES. THAT IS BASICALLY THE QUOTE FROM THAT COMMISSIONER. WELL, I DON'T BELIEVE THAT ARGUMENT EITHER. OKAY? NOW, IS IT COMPLEX WHEN YOU WATCH A HUGE MILITARY POWER, A WHITE SUPREMACIST POWER LIKE ISRAEL GUN DOWN THOUSANDS OF UNARMED HUMAN RIGHTS MARCHERS? IS THAT COMPLEX? NO, IT'S NOT COMPLEX. COUNCILMAN ACKERMAN, IT'S NOT.
00:13:45.403: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT --
00:13:49.540: >> BUT FOR THOSE OF YOU --
00:13:53.411: >> Councilmember Lumm: OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS MOZHGAN SAVABIEASFAHANI.
00:13:59.450: >> SAVABIEASFAHANI.
00:14:01.218: >> Councilmember Lumm: SAVABIEA.
00:14:02.019: >> GOOD JOB. MM-HMM. BUT FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO STILL ARE STRUGGLING WITH, YOU KNOW, WHAT IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING INPAY ISRAEL, I WILL GIVE YOU A VERY BRIEF AND QUICK, YOU KNOW, HISTORY LESSON. YOU KNOW HOW EUROPEAN COLONIZERS CAME TO THIS CONTINENT, KILLED A LOT OF THE LOCAL PEOPLE AND ON THEIR DEAD BODIES, THEY BUILT THEIR NEW COUNTRIES? THAT PEACE WHAT EUROPEAN SETTLSETTLERS DID. THEY CAME HERE AND KILLED UPWARDS OF 10 MILLION NATIVES AND ON THEIR DEAD BODIES, THEY FORCED BLACK AFRICANS TO BUILD WHAT WE SEE HERE TODAY, AMERICA. NOW, THE SAME THING HAPPENED IN PALESTINE. EUROPEAN SETTLERS WENT TO PALESTINE, MASSACRED PEOPLE OF MALL LPALESTINE, AND ON THEIR DD BODIES THEY BUILT THEIR ISRAEL. SO THAT IS A REALLY BAD THING. GENOCIDE IS BAD. KILLING PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING IN THEIR HOMES AND NOT BOTHERING YOU IS BAD. SO I RECOGNIZE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN AMERICA ARE FOR VERY LONG PERIOD BEEN PROTECTED AGAINST LEARNING ABOUT WHAT ISRAEL DOES, AND THERE HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY NO QUESTIONING WHAT ISRAEL DOES, BUT THAT IS CHANGING BECAUSE THE IDEA THAT WE SHOULD CUT OFF -- CUT OFF AID TO ISRAEL IS NOT ONLY BEING DISCUSSED HERE IN ANN ARBOR. IT'S BEING DISCUSSED AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF AMERICAN GOVERNMENT IN THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. IT'S BEING DISCUSSED. BERNIE SANDERS, VERY POPULAR PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, SAID AFTER HE HEARD THAT ISRAEL HAS DENIED VISITOR TO TLAIB. AND HE SAID IF ISRAEL DOES NOT ALLOW OUR LAWMAKERS TO VISIT ISRAEL TO SEE FOR THEMSELVES WHAT IS HAPPENING. THEN MAYBE WE SHOULD CUT OFF THE MONEY THAT WE GIVE THEM, BILLIONS AND BILLIONS AND BILLIONS. SO THIS IS NOT FAR FETCHED. THIS IS AN IDEA THAT'S BEING TOSSED AROUND BY PEOPLE IN THE CONGRESS AND PEOPLE WHO ARE HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS WHO ARE ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVISTS. WE ARE SAYING, CONSIDER. IT IS OUR DUTY TO TALK ABOUT CUTTING OFF AID TO ISRAEL. ISRAEL IS A RACIST SUPREMACIST GOVERNMENT, BEING SUPPORTED FULLY BY THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. AND $38 BILLION IS GOING TO BE GOING TO ISRAEL IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS. THAT'S $38 BILLION TO PAY FOR AMERICAN HEALTH. IT CAN PAY FOR AMERICAN PEOPLE EDUCATION. WE DON'T HAVE WHAT ISRAELIS HAVE. KEEP THE $38 BILLION AND CUT OFF THE MONEY TO THEM.
00:17:07.371: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
00:17:08.806: >> THANK YOU.
00:17:09.907: >> Councilmember Lumm: OUR NEXT SPEAKER, SORRY, -- OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS HENRY HERSKOVITZ.
00:17:26.757: >> GOOD EVENING. I WISH TO RESPOND TO SOME COMMENTS MADE HERE ON JULY 15th, THOSE COMMENTS WERE:  THIS IS HOW IT BEGINS, THEY SAY, FIRST IT'S ABOUT POTHOLES AND ROADS, THEN IT'S ABOUT FIXING THE POTHOLES AND ROADS. THEN IT'S ABOUT JEWS AND THEIR CARS CAUSING THE POT POTHOLES IE ROADS. THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO LOGICAL CONNECTION PRESENTED BY THAT SPEAKER TO CONCLUDE THAT JEWISH-OWNED CARS CREATE THE POTHOLES IN ANN ARBOR. SHE PRESENTED A LUDICROUS ARGUMENT AND ASKED THAT COUNCIL SWALLOW IT. THE SPEAKER WAS, IN MY OPINION, TRYING TO CLAIM THAT ANTI-JEWISH SENTIMENT IS CREATED IN A VACUUM. THAT NON-JEWS -- HER WORDS -- ATTRIBUTE BAD THINGS LIKE POTHOLES TO JEWS FOR ABSOLUTELY NO REASON WHATSOEVER. LET'S TRY TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT. HERE'S SOME EXAMPLES. ANTI-JEWISH SENTIMENT ALWAYS FOLLOWS BAD JEWISH GROUP BEHAVIOR. IT IS CAUSE AND EFFECT. NOT A PRODUCT OF ONE'S IMAGINATION. THERE IS A REASON FOR ANTI-JEWISH SENTIMENT. ANTI-JEWISH SENTIMENT FOLLOWS THE BOMBING THE KING DAVID HOTEL IN 1946 BY JEWISH TERRORIST BAGHAN AND THE ERGUN. AND IT FOLLOWED THE U U.S. S. LIBERTY AND THE KILLING OF 34 U.S. SAILORS. AND IT FOLLOWED THE SIXTH FLEET EN ROUTE TO SAVE THE SHIP. ANTI-JEWISH SENTIMENT FOLLOWS EVERY WHITE PHOSPHOROUS BOMB DROPPED BY THE JEWISH STATE ON TO DENSELY POPULATED PALESTINIAN NEIGHBORHOODS. IT FOLLOWS EVERY SNIPER KILLING OF UNARMED PALESTINIAN PROTESTERS. ANTI-JEWJEWISH SENTIMENT FOLLOWS THE MANIPULATION OF OUR CONGRESS, AND RECENTLY DECEASED PAUL FINLAY. IT FOLLOWS ISRAEL'S RECENT REFUSAL TO ALLOW ENTRY TO PALESTINE OF TWO MEMBERS OF OUR CONGRESS. I COULD GO ON. PERHAPS ISRAELI AUTHOR ISRAELI SHAHOK SAID IT BEST, ANTISENTIMENTISM CAN ONLY BE FOUGHT SIMULTANEOUSLY. I SEE NO EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER OF ANTIJEWISH SENTIMENT. DON'T LET PEOPLE TRY TO CONVINCE YOU OTHERWISE. COUNCIL CAN CRAFT ITS OWN RESOLUTION TO HALT MILITARY AID TO ISRAEL. SUCH A RESOLUTION IS A CALL FOR PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST, AND IT JUST DRIPS JUSTICE. THANK YOU.
00:20:21.999: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS JESSICA CHEN.
00:20:30.741: >> OH, GOOD EVENING. MY NAME IS JESSICA CHEN AND I'M A RESIDENT AND BOARD MEMBER AT THE LIBERTY LOFTS CONDO BUILDING LOCATED ON 2nd STREET IN DOWNTOWN ANN ARBOR. OUR CONDO ASSOCIATION REQUESTS THAT THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR PROVIDES COMPOST PICKUP SERVICES FOR OUR BUILDING. WE HAVE AN ONGOING GREEN LIBERTY LOFTS INITIATIVE, WHEREBY WE ARE TRYING TO REDUCE OUR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT. MANY OF ARRIVES DENTS HAVE CLAMORED FOR A COMPOSTING PROGRAM BUT OUR REQUEST TO THE CITY FOR COMPOST PICKUP HAVE BEEN DENIED. WE KNOW THE CITY SHARES OUR COMMITMENT TO REDUCING LANDFILL WASTE. SO WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS SIMPLY A BUREAUCRATIC OVERSIGHT THAT WE ARE NOW ASKING TO YOU RECTIFY. WE HAVE REQUESTED COMPOST SERVICES OF VARIOUS EMPLOYEES AT CITY HALL OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS, INCLUDING MOST RECENTLY LAUREN COLOSKI, THE ENVIRONMENTAL SUPERSIZOR OF PUBLIC WORKS WHO CONTACTED THE CITY ON OUR BEHALF. WE WERE TOLD THAT IT WAS NOT LOGISTICALLY POSSIBLE AND IN THE PAST, LIMITED CAPACITY AND POTENTIAL STREET CONGESTION HAVE BEEN CITED. WE ASK YOU TO CREDIT FOLLOWING POINTS IN RESPONSE. ONE, REGARDING CAPACITY, THERE'S A RELATIVELY CONSTANT VOLUME OF WASTE MATERIAL COMING OUT OF THE BUILDING. IF THE CITY PROVIDES COMPOST PICKUP, LESS MATERIAL WILL BE DISCARDED INTO THE LANDFILL VIA THE REGULAR TRASH PICKUP. MORE COMPOST PICKED UP BY THE CITY RESULTS IN LESS GARBAGE PICKED UP BY THE CITY. AND TWO, REGARDING STREET CONGESTION, THE CITY'S COMPOSTING PROGRAM TRUCK ALREADY SERVICES OUR BLOCK OF 2 2nd STREET FOR THE NEIGHBORING PROPERTIES. THIS SAME TRUCK NEED ONLY MAKE AN ADDITIONAL STOP TO EMPTY A BIN FROM LIBERTY LOFTS. OUR REQUEST IS FOR A SERVICE ALREADY PROVIDED TO OTHER ANN ARBOR RESIDENTS AND COVERED BY PROPERTY TAXES. WHILE THE INCREASE IN MULTIFAMILY DWELLINGS IN DOWNTOWN ANN ARBOR MAY INDEED HAVE LED TO INCREASED COMPLEXITY FOR WASTE MANAGEMENT, THIS ISSUE SHOULD BE ADDRESSED SOONER RATHER THAN LATER. WE WANT TO BE ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE, AND WE PAY OUR FAIR SHARE THROUGH PROPERTY TAXES FOR COMPOST PICKUP. SO WE ARE ASKING FOR TWO SPECIFIC ACTIONS TO BE TAKEN. FIRST, COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, HAS ADVISED ME THAT THE CITY IS CURRENTLY RETHINKING THE SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT PLAN. SO WE ASK THAT WHEN COMPOST CONTRACTS ARE RENEGOTIATED, COMPOSTING SERVICES ARE PROVIDED TO MULTIFAMILY BUILDINGS. AND SECOND, IN THE MEANTIME, WE ASK THAT THE COUNCIL DIRECT THE PUBLIC WORKS MANAGER TO ALLOW OUR BUILDING A SINGLE BIN FOR COMPOST OF THE SAME SIZE AS A SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENCE TO BE PICKED UP AT THE SAME TIME AS THE OTHER PINS  BINS ON OUR BLO. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THIS MATTER.
00:23:22.279: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OUR NEXT AND LAST SPEAKER IS MARK KOROI.
00:23:31.688: >> THANK YOU. I AM HERE TODAY TO DISCUSS THE POLICE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE, THAT HAS -- THAT WAS FORMED AND I WANT TO GO OVER SOME OF THE TOPICS I BELIEVE THEY SHOULD LOOK INTO. I SHARED SOME OF THIS WITH THE COMMITTEE EARLIER, AND SOME OF YOU WERE ALREADY THERE BECAUSE A COUPLE OF YOU WERE EX OFFICIO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. ONE THING I FOUND DISTURBING RECENTLY -- NOT SO RECENTLY. IT'S ACTUALLY A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO, WHICH I HOPE THEY LOOK INTO IT IS THE FACT THAT THIS WAS AN INCIDENT THAT WAS SUPPORTED NATIONALLY ABOUT A HATE CRIME AGAINST A MUSLIM U OF M STUDENT. AND WHAT DISTURBED ME ABOUT IT WAS THE FBI INVESTIGATED AND POLICE INVESTIGATED AND THE PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE OF WASHTENAW COUNTY INVESTIGATED IT. AND THE FBI NEVER MADE ANY PUBLIC STATEMENTS REGARDING THE INCIDENT, HOWEVER, THE -- ONE OF THE INVESTIGATING PERSONNEL FROM THE ANN ARBOR POLICE DEPARTMENT MADE A STATEMENT THAT THE -- HE BELIEVED THAT THE STATEMENT MADE BY THE ALLEGED VICTIM WAS FALSE, THAT HE BELIEVED IT WAS FABRICATED. AND HE WAS GOING TO SEND A REPORT TO THAT EFFECT TO THE PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE. WHAT HAPPENED WAS THE PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE, AFTER REVIEWING IT, ISSUED THEIR OWN STATEMENT SAYING THE INTEREST OF JUSTICE REQUIRED NO CHARGE TO BE FILED AGAINST THIS YOUNG WOMAN. IT LEFT A LOT OF QUESTIONS, IN MY MIND, BECAUSE I'M WONDERING IF THERE'S POLICIES INVOLVED THAT PROHIBIT POLICE PERSONNEL FROM MAKING STATEMENTS REGARDING PEOPLE WHO ARE MAKING COMPLAINTS TO THE POLICE DEPARTMENT. IN THIS CASE, I'M WONDERING WHAT MESSAGE IT SENDS TO THE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO REPORT HATE CRIMES THAT IF THEY DO, THAT AN OFFICER IS GOING TO MAKE STATEMENTS -- AND THEY WERE REPORTED NATIONWIDE, THE "WASHINGTON POST" COVERED IT, EVERYONE COVERED THIS. AND WHAT DOES IT TELL THE PUBLIC WHEN THE PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE MAKES A BIG STATEMENT THAT THERE WILL BE NO CHARGES AGAINST THIS YOUNG WOMAN. IT LEADS SOMEONE TO BELIEVE THAT SOMETHING WAS NOT DONE IN A PROPER MANNER AND THIS POLICE WAS VIOLATING A RULE OR SHOULD THERE BE A RULE THAT PREVENTS THIS TIME THE DISCLOSURE. AND DOES IT CREATE DISTRUST BETWEEN THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY AND OUR P.D.? I DON'T KNOW. THERE ARE VERY QUESTIONABLE CIRCUMSTANCES REGARDING THAT PARTICULAR CASE, WHICH HAVE NEVER BEEN RESOLVED TO MY SATISFACTION ANYWAY. SECONDLY, I'M WONDERING WHAT GOES ON AS FAR AS THE POLICE DEPARTMENT. THERE'S SOMETHING CALLED THE LAW NET, THE LIVING WASHTENAW ENFORCEMENT TEAM. WHAT ARE WE DOING TO SUPERVISE THIS AGENCY? YOU KNOW, THEY ARE INVOLVED IN VARIOUS TYPES OF DRUG OPERATIONS, AND I SUED MANY OF THESE PEOPLE AND OTHER UNITS ACROSS THE STATE. IT'S VERY QUESTIONABLE BEHAVIOR. WHAT IS THE CITY DOING TO SUPERVISE THESE PEOPLE? I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT WHAT TOOLS THAT THEY ARE USING, TASERS ARE ONE THING. A STATE TROOPER WENT TO PRISON FOR USING A TASER IMPRUDENTLY. WE HAVE TO MAKE THESE POLICIES PUBLIC AND A LOOK AT WHAT GOES ON IN OUR POLICE DEPARTMENT. THANK YOU.
00:26:48.485: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU. NEXT ARE COUNCIL COMMUNICATIONS. ARE THERE COMMUNICATIONS FROM COUNCIL? COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
00:26:59.796: >> Councilmember Bannister: JUST ONE ANNOUNCEMENT. I JUST WANTED TO GIVE AN ANNOUNCEMENT THAT WE WILL NOT BE HAVING COUNCIL CAUCUS ON TWO WEEKS FROM SUNDAY BECAUSE IT'S -- WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE MEETING -- THE COUNCIL MEETING WILL BE POSTPONED TO TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 3rd THAT WEEK. AND SO THE EVENING BEFORE THE MEETING, WILL ACTUALLY BE LABOR DAY AND SO MANY OF US WILL BE AT LABOR DAY PICNICS ON MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 2. ALSO, COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER AND I, I BELIEVE WE WANT TO SPEAK TO -- THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF UPROAR IN WARD ONE IN THE LAST FEW DAYS ABOUT THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF A ROUNDABOUT BEING BUILT ON BROADWAY OUT IN FRONT OF THE MORNINGSIDE DEVELOPMENT. THE CONSTRUCTION IS SUPPOSED TO START ON SEPTEMBER 6th, AND THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF CONCERN IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD THAT THAT WILL DIVERT TRAFFIC UP THE BROADWAY HILL INSTEAD OF ON TO PLYMOUTH ROAD WHICH PLYMOUTH ROAD WAS DESIGNED TO HANDLE THE COMMUTER TRAFFIC AND BROADWAY IS A RESIDENTIAEET. SO WE ARE ALSO LOOKING AT THE CONCERNS OVER THE PEDESTRIAN AND BIKE SAFETY ISSUES AROUND THIS ROUNDABOUT ISSUE THAT HAVE NOT YET BEEN ADDRESSED. SO I WANT TO THANK ALL THE RESIDENTS FOR THEIR NUMEROUS PHONE CALLS AND EMAILS ABOUT THIS ROUNDABOUT AND COUNCIL IS WORKING ON IT AND WE SHOULD HAVE NEWS BY THAT SEPTEM SEPTEMBER 3rd MEETING IF NOT BEFORE. THANK YOU.
00:28:39.896: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU. COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
00:28:43.600: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WANT TO THANK STAFF FOR THE MONTHLY CROSSWALK UPDATE REPORT, AND ALSO FOR THE ONGOING WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE ON THE ROAD RECONSTRUCTION PROJECTS. I KNOW IT'S QUITE FRUSTRATING WHEN COUNCIL VOTES DOWN A ROAD RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT, BUT SOMETIMES IT'S NOT NO, WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING. IT'S NO, ANN ARBOR DESERVES BETTER AND THERE ARE SOME IMPROVEMENTS THAT CAN BE MADE TO MAKE IT EVEN SAFER FOR ALL ROADWAY USERS AND ESPECIALLY THE CYCLISTS AND THE PEDESTRIANS AND THAT IS WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW. AND I ALSO WANT TO THANK EVERYONE WHO HAS WRITTEN IN, EVERYONE WHO HAS TALKED TO ME. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A SAFE ANN ARBOR. YESTERDAY, I WAS AT THE SUSTAINABILITY PICNIC, AND LEADERS AND MEMBERS FROM ALMOST EVERY NONPROFIT AND COMMUNITY GROUP RELATED TO SUSTAINABILITY. THERM ALL WORKING TOGETHER. DR. MISSY SHULTZ WAS THERE. IT WAS REALLY A POSITIVE EXPERIENCE AND IT GOT ME THINKING WHY CAN'T WE HAVE A LEADER LIKE DR. SHULTZ FOR VISION ZERO, LIKE WE DO FOR SUSTAINABILITY? SOMEONE WHO IS GOING TO BRING US ALL TOGETHER, AND MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE SPENDING ALL OF OUR DOLLARS WISELY? SO I'M REALLY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THAT AND WE DO HAVE AN OPEN POSITION IN THE BUDGET IN THAT AREA. SO I ALSO WANT TO MAKE A COMMENT THAT I HAVE HEARD THAT ROAD DIE DIETS AND ROAD RECONFIGURATIONS, WHEN WE ARE JUST PAINTING LINES ON THE ROAD THAT IT'S LOW RISK, BECAUSE IT'S LOW COST. IT'S NEVER LOW RISK, WHEN YOU ARE DEALING WITH A VEHICLE AND A HUMAN THAT'S ON THE ROADWAY. THERE'S ALWAYS RISK OF HUMAN INJURY. WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL. ANOTHER GOOD NEWS ITEM IS WE ARE RECEIVING MONEY FROM THE COUNTY AND IT INCLUDES A FEW YEARS OUT BUT MAYBE WE CAN MOVE IT UP SOONER FOR BIKE INFRASTRUCTURE ON WASHINGTON STREET. I DID NOT VOTE FOR THE WILLIAMS STREET BIKE INFRASTRUCTURE BECAUSE I REALLY WANTED WASHINGTON STREET AND IT LOOKS LIKE THAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN SOONER RATHER THAN LATER. SO THANK YOU.
00:31:06.743: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COUNCILMEMBERS? I DO HAVE A COMMENT. I WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT ON A MEETING THAT'S TAKING PLACE ON WEDNESDAY WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN. FIRE CHIEF KENNEDY AND ASSISTANT ADMINISTRATOR FOURNIER ARE THE CITY REPS AT THE MEETING, WHICH INCLUDES DISCUSSIONS OF UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN STUDENT-LED PROJECT WHO DEVELOPED A PROTOTYPE FIRE STATION AND THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN'S FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR REPLACEMENT OF FIRE STATION NUMBER 57 5 ON CAMPUS. STATION 5 IS OUT OF DATE. AND RELOCATING THE STATION MAY RESULT IN BETTER SERVICE TO NORTHEAST ANN ARBOR. THE RESPONSE TIMES IN NORTHEAST ANN ARBOR ARE ALREADY A BIT WORSE THAN THE BALANCE OF THE CITY, AND WITH ALL THE RESIDENTIAL GROWTH TAKING PLACE, IT'S CLEAR THAT SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE. STAFF INDICATED BACK IN APRIL THAT THE CITY MADE A REQUEST TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN TO INCLUDE APPROXIMATELY $5 MILLION IN UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN'S CAPITAL PLAN TO PAY FOR CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW STATION. THE CITY ALSO ASKED THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN TO FUND A REPLACEMENT. THEY WILL BE FOLLOWING UP ON THAT ASK ON WEDNESDAY. HOPEFULLY UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN WILL COMMIT TO FINANCIAL SUPPORT. THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN DOES NOT PAY TAXES AND HAS TAKEN SEVERAL PROPERTIES OFF THE TAX ROLLS OVER THE YEARS, AND FUNDING A NEW STATION WOULD, IN MY OPINION, DEMONSTRATE THE UNIVERSITY COMMITMENT TO BEING A STRONG COMMUNITY PARTNER, PLUS A NEW STATION BENEFITS UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AS WELL AS THE CITY. AND THEN JUST TO FOLLOW ON TO COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD'S COMMENT ABOUT THESE ROAD REENGINEERING, REDESIGN PLANS, I WILL JUST NOTE THAT -- THAT THE RECONSTRUCTION PLANS FOR THESE ROADS ARE NOT BEING INTERRUPTED. IT'S THE REENGINEERING THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. THE RECONSTRUCTION PLANS, ALTHOUGH I KNOW THEY ARE VIEWED AS NOT TIMELY ENOUGH FOR MANY, AND IF YOU DRIVE THESE ROADS, YOU WILL APPRECIATE THAT FIRSTHAND. BUT THOSE -- THOSE PLANS FOR RECONSTRUCTION ARE STILL IN OUR CAPITAL IMPROVEPROVEMENTS PLAN D ARE NOT BEING DISRUPTED BY THESE CONTINUING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE REENGINEERING PLANS. THANK YOU. SO NO OTHER COMMUNICATIONS. IN TERMS OF COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE MAYOR, MAYOR TAYLOR IS MAKING THE FOLLOWING APPOINTMENT NOMINATIONS FOR COUNCIL'S CONSIDERATION AT OUR SEPTEMBER 3rd MEETING. COUNCILMEMBER ZACH ACKERMAN REAPPOINTMENT TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION THROUGH JUNE 30th, 2020. DEANNA LERNIHAN, A PARTIAL TERM POTERMAPPOINTMENT TO THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION TO 2021 AND JAMES SUMMERS ALSO A PARTIAL TERM APPOINTMENT TO THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION. THIS ONE WOULD BE THROUGH MAY 31st, 2022. MR. SUMMERS IS NOT A RESIDENT SO IT WOULD REQUIRE SEVEN VOTES TO WAIVE THE RESIDENCY REQUIREMENT. AGAIN, THESE ARE FOR COUNCIL CONSIDERATION AT OUR NEXT MEETING SEPTEMBER 3rd. MOVING TO THE CONSENT AGENDA, CAN SOMEONE PLEASE MOVE THE CONSENT AGENDA. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER EATON. IS THERE A SECOND? SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD. IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION OF THE CONSENT AGENDA? COUNCILMEMBER NELSON?
00:34:33.182: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I WOULD LIKE TO PULL FOR DISCUSSION CA-15 PLEASE.
00:34:41.658: >> Councilmember Lumm: OKAY. WE WILL MOVE CA-15 TO FIRST ITEM. OFFAFTER THE CONSENT AGENDA. SO IT WOULD BE CA-15, IT WILL BE THE FIRST ITEM AFTER THE CONSENT AGENDA. THANK YOU. ANY OTHERS? DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
00:35:04.981: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT ON CA-5, IT'S APPROVAL FOR A SUPPLEMENTAL FIRE SERVICES AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE CITY AND THE REGENTS THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN THROUGH AUGUST OF 2024. IT'S MY HOPE THAT THE REMARKS THAT THE MAYOR PRO TEM MADE EARLIER THAT THOSE ARE REFLECTED IN THIS AGREEMENT AND WE FIND IT'S APPROPRIATE.
00:35:31.708: >> Councilmember Lumm: HEAR,
00:35:36.512: >> Councilmember Eaton: MS. MAYO R PRO TEM.
00:35:40.116: >> Councilmember Lumm: COUNCILM.
00:35:42.218: >> Councilmember Eaton: IN LOU OF PULLING CA-6, I WANTED TO MAKE SOME COMMENTS I MADE AT THE CAUCUS, MAY HAVE CONFUSED MY COLLEAGUES. THIS IS COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT OF THE DISCUSSION THAT'S ONGOING ABOUT DEVELOPMENT PREMIUMS IN THE DOWNTOWN ZONING AREAS. THIS IS JUST A ROUTINE REVISION OF OUR FEE SCHEDULE FOR PAYMENTS IN LIEU OF PROVIDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING, AND THIS IS JUST AN ADJUSTMENT THAT WE DO ANNUALLY. SO PARDON ME FOR ANY COMMENT THAT I MADE THAT MAY HAVE CONFUSED ANY OF MY COLLEAGUES LAST NIGHT AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS.
00:36:19.322: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER EATON. ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OF CONSENT AGENDA? OKAY. SO ALL IN FAVOR OF APPROVING CONSENT AGENDA ITEMS 1 THROUGH 14. PLEASE INDICATE BY SAYING AYE. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? THE CONSENT AGENDA IS APPROVED WITH TEN COUNCILMEMBERS PRESENT, SATISFYING THE EIGHT VOTE REQUIREMENT ALSO ON CA-4. AND NOW IF SOMEONE WOULD MOVE CONSENT AGENDA ITEM CA-15. COUNCILMEMBER NELSON. SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER EATON. COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
00:37:01.764: >> Councilmember Nelson:  YES, I JUST HAD A FEW QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS ITEM. I'M TRYING TO PULL IT UP ON MY COMPUTER AND MY COMPUTER IS ACTING UP. I UNDERSTAND THAT WE MADE A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS LAST SEPTEMBER, AND THEN THERE WERE SEVEN RESPONSES. SO I WAS JUST LOOKING AT THE DETAILS OF THIS ITEM, AND LOOKING FOR THE DETAILS -- LOOKING FOR THE EXPLANATION OF HOW THE OTHER PROPOSALS WERE EVALUATED AND REJECTED. AND I'M JUST WONDERING IF THAT
00:37:27.190: >> Councilmember Lumm: MR. FORNI ER? THANK YOU.
00:37:35.398: >> SO IT'S A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL FOR PROFESSIONAL SERVICES, AND SO THE PROPOSALS ARE ALL EVALUATED BASED ON THE QUALITY OF THE SERVICE, EXPERIENCE OF THE INDIVIDUAL, EXPERIENCE OF THE COMPANY IN ADDITION TO PRICE. SO I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN GET INTO SPECIFIC DETAIL ABOUT, YOU KNOW, THE OTHER PROPOSALS, BUT THE COMMITTEE, I BELIEVE, WAS UNANIMOUS IN THEIR CHOICE OF DR. DAVIS BECAUSE OF HER EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH PUBLIC SECTOR AGENCIES AND HER EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH CITIES, IN PARTICULAR.
00:38:12.068: >> Councilmember Nelson: OKAY. YEAH COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER HAD LOVELY THANKS TO SAY ABOUT DR. DAVIS. I NEVER MET HER. WE PASSED A RESOLUTION IN DECEMBER ABOUT RFPs LIKE THIS. BECAUSE YOU HAVE A SYSTEM OF SCORING AND CHOOSING THE BEST PROPOSAL AND SO I GUESS MY QUESTION WAS, I JUST WAS WONDERING IF YOU STILL HAD THAT INFORMATION, BECAUSE THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO COME TO US WITH THIS. AND IF  I JUST PROBABLY APOLOGIE FOR NOT SUBMITTING THIS QUESTION IN WRITING THIS WEEK.
00:38:52.975: >> YES, WE HAVE ALL OF THESE RECORDS IN CITY HALL. ALL OF THAT INFORMATION IS PRESERVED. SO --
00:38:57.647: >> Councilmember Nelson: OKAY.
00:39:00.816: >> Councilmember Lumm: COUNCILM. ARE YOU FINISHED COUNCILMEMBER NELSON?
00:39:06.155: >> Councilmember Nelson:  YES.
00:39:07.456: >> Councilmember Eaton: I WOULD LIKE POSTPONE, UNTIL WE RECEIVE THAT INFORMATION THAT WE PASSED IN DECEMBER.
00:39:14.397: >> Councilmember Lumm: IS THERE SUPPORT FOR THE POSTPONEMENT. COUNCILMEMBER NELSON? AND TO A DATE? YES.
00:39:22.004: >> Councilmember Eaton: IT WON'T TAKE YOU LONG TO PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION.
00:39:24.440: >> NO, NOT AT ALL.
00:39:29.178: >> Councilmember Lumm: SEPTEMBE?
00:39:33.049: >> City Admin. Lazarus: I THINK WE ARE FINE WITH THAT.
00:39:34.750: >> YEAH, THAT'S FINE.
00:39:36.052: >> City Admin. Lazarus: JUST A LITTLE BIT OF SHIPS CROSSING IN THE NIGHT WHERE THIS WAS PUT OUT BEFORE THAT RESOLUTION WAS ADOPTED. CERTAINLY, THERE'S NO SECRECY HERE. AND WE CAN SUMMARIZE THE DATA FOR YOU.
00:39:48.297: >> Councilmember Lumm: OKAY. THANK YOU. ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION POSTPONEMENT. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
00:39:52.902: >> Councilmember Hayner:  IS THERE A -- SO A LOT OF US WEREN'T ON COUNCIL WHEN THIS WAS PASSED, THIS JOINING UP WITH THE ONE COUNTY, RIGHT? AND SO THIS IS DRIVEN FROM THAT ONE COUNTY INITIATIVE; IS THAT CORRECT?
00:40:06.949: >> City Admin. Lazarus: IT STEMMED FROM IT. I THINK TO GET INTO A LITTLE BUILT OF DETAIL, WE WERE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TO FOLLOW UP THE INITIAL TRAINING THAT WAS PROVIDED. WE PUT OUT AN RFP. THERE WERE MANY RESPONDENTS AND THIS WAS INTERVIEWING AND SCORING THAT OCCURRED. BASED UPON THAT, DR. DAVIS' FIRM WAS THE TOP RATED. SHE GRACIOUSLY CAME AND GAVE A SESSION AT THE LIBRARY LAST MARCH. FEBRUARY. CLOSE ENOUGH. AND WE FUNDED THIS IN THE CURRENT F.Y. '20 BUDGET. SO THAT'S WHY THERE'S AN EXTENDED PERIOD INVOLVED. BUT IT IS -- YOU KNOW, I ACTUALLY MET WITH ADMINISTRATOR DILL LAST WEEK, AND I THINK THERE'S A REMERGING OF THE WAYS WITH THE CITY AND THE COUNTY ON THE ONE COMMUNITY INITIATIVE.
00:40:53.262: >> Councilmember Hayner: YEAH, I JUST WAS WONDERING WHERE THIS WHOLE NOTION CAME FROM. THANK YOU.
00:40:58.701: >> City Admin. Lazarus: THIS WAS PASSED IN A RESOLUTION BY COUNCIL A WHILE AGO AND WE HAVE BEEN REPORTING QUARTERLY ON ACTIONS WE HAVE TAKEN UNDER THE D.E.I. PROGRAM BUT THERE WAS ALWAYS THE INTENT WITH COUNCIL TO FOLLOW UP WITH TRAINING AND INCLUDE A STAFF ASSESSMENT AS PART OF THAT.
00:41:16.052: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU. ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR OF THE POSTPONEMENT TO SEPTEMBER 3rd, PLEASE INDICATE BY SAYING AYE. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? OKAY. APPROVED AND POSTPONED TO SEPTEMBER 3rd. WE NOW COME TO PUBLIC HEARINGS. THERE ARE FOUR PUBLIC HEARINGS TONIGHT. TO SPEAK DURING PUBLIC HEARINGS, YOU NEED NOT HAVE SIGNED UP IN ADVANCE. SPEAKERS HAVE THREE MINUTES IN WHICH TO SPEAK. PLEASE PAY CLOSE TO ATTENTION TO THE TIME CLOCK. SPEAKERS MAY ONLY ADDRESS THE SUBJECT OF PUBLIC HEARING AND MAY NOT GRANT ANY TIME TO ANOTHER SPEAKER. YOU MAY SPEAK ONLY ONCE ON THIS TOPIC. IF THERE ARE MULTIPLE SPEAKERS PLEA FORM QUEUES ON EITHER SIDE OF THE COUNCIL CHAMBER AND ALLOW ALL SPEAKERS TO BE HEARD. IF YOU REQUIRE ASSISTANCE SPEAKING BEFORE COUNCIL, WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE IT. THE FIRST PUBLIC HEARING TONIGHT IS. AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND SECTIONS 5.15 (TABLE 5-15), 5.17.3, 5.17.5 (TABLE 5:17-5), AND SECTION 5.37.2 OF CHAPTER 55 (UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE) OF TITLE V OF THE CODE OF THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR (PERMITTED USE TABLE, PARKLAND DONATIONS, DIMENSIONAL STANDARDS TABLE, FRONT LOT LINE) IS THIS ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING? SEEING NO OTHER SPEAKERS, THIS PUBLIC HEARING IS CLOSED. PUBLIC HEARING NUMBER TWO IS AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND THE ZONING MAP, BEING A PART OF SECTION 5:10.2 OF CHAPTER 55 OF TITLE V OF THE CODE OF ANN ARBOR, REZONING OF 0.2 ACRE FROM C1B (COMMUNITY CONVENIENCE CENTER DISTRICT) TO C1A (CAMPUS BUSINESS DISTRICT) WITH CONDITIONS, THE GARNET REZONING, 325 EAST SUMMIT STREET. I SHOULD MENTION THAT THE DEVELOPER HAS REQUESTED POSTPONEMENT OF THE GARNET REZONING. SO THE FOLKS WHO CAME TO SPEAK ARE AWARE OF THESE TWO AGENDA ITEMS, MAY BE POSTPONED. HAVING SAID THAT, IS THERE ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING?
00:43:30.452: >> THANK YOU. MY NAME IS ETHEL POTTS. AS YOU ALL KNOW, EACH PARCEL OF THE LAND IN THE CITY IS ZONED FOR A REASON, MOSTLY SO THEY CONFORM TO AN AREA PLAN OR A MASTER PLAN, SO THAT IT WILL BE DEVELOPED SUITALELY WITH NO NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON SURROUNDING PARCELS OR NEIGHBORHOODS. BUT TO KEEP A ZONING -- KEEP A CONTINUOUS ZONING GIVES STABILITY AND PREDICTABILITY TO A NEIGHBORHOOD. NO ONE WANTS A SURPRISE WHEN WE DISCOVER THAT THERE'S A DIFFERENT TYPE OF DEVELOPMENT NEXT DOOR TO US OR ACROSS THE STREET. A ZONING CHANGE COULD BE JUSTIFIED IF IT WERE TO CORRECT A PROBLEM, BUT NO PROBLEM HAS BEEN MENTIONED. ONLY CHANGESES TO A LONG-TIME HISTORIC DISTRICT. C1A, SETS STANDARDS INTENDED FOR CAMPUS RESIDENTIAL AND SHOPPING AREAS OF THE CITY. THIS IS WRITTEN INTO THE CODE. 325 SUMMIT IS QUITE A DIFFERENT KIND OF NEIGHBORHOOD. IT'S CHARMING OLD HOUSES. IT IS WHEELER PARK, THE TRAIN STATION, AND BROADWAY BRIDGE. IT'S THE HISTORIC NCPOA, NORTH CENTRAL NEIGHBORHOOD IS WHAT IT IS. C1A ZONE AS ZONING DOES NOT REQE 10-FOOT SETBACK THAT WE HAVE CURRENTLY IN THE OTHER ZONING. THE C1A ZONING WOULD HAVE US GIVE UP ALSO A BUILDING HEIGHT LIMIT. SO THIS IS SETBACKS AND HEIGHT LIMITS, WHICH ARE NOW IN EFFECT, WHICH WOULD NOT BE WITH THE NEW ZONING. THE PETITIONER MAY WANT TO TWEAK THE PROPOSAL FOR A LATER DECISION, BUT NO SMALL CHANGES WILL MAKE C1A A WORKABLE ZONING. A NO VOTE TONIGHT WILL PREVENT A WRONG ZONING.
00:45:32.508: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU.
00:45:38.113: >> MY NAME IS JOHN RASMUSSEN. I HAVE LIVED IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD, BEGINNING BACK IN 1960, 505 DIVISION STREET, ONE BLOCK FROM THIS PROPERTY. FOR THE PAST NINE OR TEN YEARS, I HAVE AN OFFICE FOR A NOT-FOR-PROFIT WHICH IS DIRECTLY ADJACENT TO THIS SITE. I HAVE SEEN THE ALLEY DETERIORATED BECAUSE THE PAVING HAS NOT BEEN REPAIRED. IF THIS BUILDING IS BUILT, THEY REPAVE THE ALLEY. THE DENSITY INCREASED IN THAT SITE ALLOWS PEOPLE TO WALK TO KERRYTOWN, AND FOR COFFEE OR TO THE FARMER'S MARK A MARKET AND I DO ON A DAILY BASIS. THE BUILDING THERE IS NOT AN HISTORIC BUILDING. GARNET JOHNSON HAS BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF TWO FAMILY BUILDINGS, BASICALLY, IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD GOING BACK MORE THAN 20 OR 30 YEARS AND THE THINGS SHE'S DONE TO IMPROVE THE BUILDING. THIS BUILDING WILL BE A BENEFIT TO THE COMMUNITY. PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO WALK TO KERRYTOWN, BE ABLE TO WALK TO THE FARMERS MARKET AND WALK TO WORK DOWNTOWN. AND I THINK IT WOULD BE AN IMPROVEMENT FOR THE NEIGHBORHOOD. THE HOUSE IS NOT HISTORIC. IT HAS BEEN REMODELED. IT'S NOT HISTORIC. I SUPPORT A VOTE IN FAVOR TONIGHT.
00:47:10.439: >> HELLO, MY NAME IS JEFF CROCKETT AT 506 EAST KINGSLEY. AND I WANT TO MAKE CLEAR THAT THIS IS NOT AN HISTORIC PROPERTY ISSUE AT ALL. IT'S A ZONING ISSUE. AND EFFIE SORT OF REALLY CLARIFIES THAT THIS IS NOT REALLY A CAMPUS BUSINESS DISTRICT. AND BASICALLY, IT BRINGS THE QUESTION OF WHAT IS? SO, I MEAN, THIS IS A MAP OF ALL THE UNIVERSITY-OWNED PROPERTIES. SO IF YOU SAY THAT THIS IS A CAMPUS BUSINESS DISTRICT, WHAT ABOUT ALL THE OTHER PROPERTY -- UNIVERSITY PROPERTIES ON THIS MAP? THIS OPENS UP A HUGE LOOPHOLE, BECAUSE THIS IS NOT REALLY WELL DEFINED. AND IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT THE BUSINESS DEPARTMENT -- OR THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT BEFORE WE CONSIDER APPLYING A ZONING CATEGORY TO THIS PARTICULAR PROPERTY, REALLY NEEDS TO CLARIFY UNDER WHAT -- WHERE THESE CAMPUS BUSINESS DISTRICTS ARE, BECAUSE RIGHT NOW, THIS IS SORT OF EQUIVALENT TO FUZZY MATH. IT'S FUZZY ZONING. AND WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BEFORE WE APPROVE IT. THE OTHER THING HERE IS, WHAT EXACTLY IS THE PUBLIC BENEFIT? THE GOAL AS I UNDERSTAND IN ANN ARBOR IS TO TRY TO IMPROVE BASICALLY AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SO THESE UNITS AT $450 A SQUARE FOOT, ACCORDING TO AN MLIVE ARTICLE, WILL VARY BETWEEN $495,000 AND $810,000. SO EXACTLY WHO CAN AFFORD THESE UNITS FOR THE BENEFIT THEY WERE TRYING TO GIVE THEM? WELL, IT'S MOSTLY WEALTHY FOLKS. OKAY? IT'S NOT THE PEOPLE WE ARE TRYING TO HELP, WHICH IS WORKFORCE HOUSING AND LESS. SO THERE'S REALLY NOT MUCH OF A PUBLIC BENEFIT TO THIS AT ALL. SO WHAT THIS IS REALLY ABOUT IS UP ZONING. AND THERE'S CLEARLY A MOVEMENT FROM SOME OF THE MEMBERS OF COUNCIL TO UP ZONE. THE QUESTION, IS THERE'S A MOVEMENT TO UP ZONE EVERYWHERE. THIS IS LIKE LETTING THE CAMEL GET ITS NOSE INTO THE TENT. AND WHAT HAPPENS? WELL, SOON YOU HAVE THE CAMEL INSIDE THE TENT. YOU HAVE BASICALLY GRANTED THIS LITTLE EXCEPTION TO THE ZONING, BUT IT OPENS THE DOOR TO A WHOLE BUNCH OF OTHER DEVELOPERS WHO ALSO WANT TO INCREASE DENSITY NEAR UNIVERSITY HOUSING, TO DO THE SAME. AND HOW CAN YOU DENY THEM IF YOU GRANT THIS? SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU NOT TO ALLOW THE SPOT ZONING, BUT INSTEAD DELAY AND FIND OUT FROM THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT EXACTLY WHAT THE CAMPUS BUSINESS DISTRICT NOT ONLY WAS INTENDED TO DO, BUT WHAT IT CURRENTLY SHOULD APPLY TO. THANK YOU.
00:50:15.090: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU.
00:50:17.526: >> GOOD EVENING. MY NAME IS CHRIS CROCKETT. MY HUSBAND JEFF AND I HAVE ALREADY SUBMITTED A LETTER TO YOU. BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SAY A FEW WORDS ABOUT THIS PROJECT ALSO. KELLY ANDERSON, THE DEVELOPER, MET WITH ME A NUMBER OF MONTHS AGO ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT, AND I UNDERSTOOD AT THAT TIME THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE A LUXURY DEVELOPMENT. ALTHOUGH THAT MADE ME UNCOMFORTABLE, I HAD NO OBJECTION TO IT, THAT'S WHAT SHE WAS PLANNING, AND IT'S HER RIGHT TO BUILD LUXURY DEVELOPMENT, EVEN THOUGH I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AT THE SAME TIME, DURING THAT MEETING, I SPECIFICALLY ASKED IF THERE WAS ANY NEED FOR ANY KIND OF ZONING CHANGE OR ANY KIND OF VARIANCE. SHE ASSURED ME NONE WAS NEEDED TO ACHIEVE THE BUILDING THAT SHE PRESENTED TO ME AT THAT TIME. WE HAD NO LATER MEETING ON THAT BUILDING. SO WHAT SHE PRESENTED WAS, I THOUGHT, WHAT WAS GOING TO BE PRESENTED TO YOU. AS IT TURNED OUT, THAT WAS NOT SO. YOU WERE PRESENTED WITH A LARGER BUILDING AND ASKED FOR A DIFFERENT ZONING, EVEN THOUGH SHE ASSURED ME THAT NOTHING LIKE THIS WAS NECESSARY. THE CAMPUS BUSINESS DISTRICT HOUSING HAS BEEN CONSTRUED BY SOME AS ACCEPTABLE BECAUSE THIS IS CLOSE TO THE CAMPUS. THE CLOSEST CAMPUS BUILDINGS ARE A HALF A WH MILE IN ONE CASE, THAT'S THE NURSING SCHOOL. THAT BUILDING IS A HALF A WHILE AWAY AND THE KELLOGG CENTER IS MORE THAN A HALF A MILE AWAY. SO IF YOU USE THAT MEASURE, THEN YOU COULD HAVE THE WHOLE CITY OF ANN ARBOR PRETTY MUCH ZONED -- SPOT ZONED CAMPUS BUSINESS DISTRICT. BECAUSE WE HAVE U OF M BUILDINGS ALL OVER TOWN! THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO DO, AND WHAT THE DEVELOPER NEEDS TO DO, IF A LARGER BUILDING IS DESIRED, IS TO GO FOR A P.U.D. AND TO PRESENT A PUBLIC BENEFIT AT THE SAME TIME. I HAVE NO OBJECTION TO THERE BEING A NEW BUILDING ON THIS SITE, AND I TOLD KELLY ANDERSON THAT WHEN I MET WITH HER. I SUPPORTED IT. I DO NOT SUPPORT THIS CHANGE OF ZONING BECAUSE SETTING THIS PRECEDENT WHEREBY ANYTHING -- ANY SITE WITHIN A HALF A MILE OF A UNIVERSITY BUILDING CAN BE REZONED CAMPUS BUSINESS DISTRICT WITH NO HEIGHT LIMITS ENDANGERS THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY. I URGE YOU TO PLEASE TURN THIS DOWN AND TO URGE THE DEVELOPER, IF THEY WANT A LARGER BUILDING, TO GO WITH A PUD WHERE THERE IS A SPECIFIED PUBLIC BENEFIT. THANK YOU.
00:53:12.734: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS COUNCIL AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING?
00:53:25.147: >> GOOD EVENING. MY NAME IS DAVID SILKWORTH, I'M A RESIDENT OF THE 5th WARD. I'M HERE TO DISCUSS ITEM B2 OR THE GARNET REZONING. I URGE ALL OF YOU TO REJECT THE SPOT REZONING OF THIS PARCEL FROM C1B COMMUNITY CONVENIENCE CENTER TO C1A CAMPUS BUSINESS, BECAUSE IT'S A MISAPPLICATION OF OUR ZONING LAWS AND A CLEAR DEVIATION FROM OUR MASTER PLAN. CHAPTER 7, THE CENTER AREA SECTION OF THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR MASTER PLAN LAND USE ELEMENT, PROVIDES FOR HIGHER DEVELOPMENT DENSITIES AND A WIDER VARIETY OF BUILDING USES INSIDE OUR URBAN CORE. THIS IS INTENDED TO PROMOTE A HEALTHY DOWNTOWN COMMERCIAL BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT, AND TO ACCOMMODATE THE RESIDENTIAL SERVICE AND ENTERTAINMENT NEEDS OF DOWNTOWN RESIDENTS, WHICH IN SOME AREAS INCLUDES A LOT OF UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN STUDENTS. THIS PLAN CALLS FOR A VERY DENSE URBAN CORE, DESIGNATED BY D1 AND D2. BUT CAN -- BUT IT ALSO CALLS FOR BUFFER OR TRANSITION AREAS BETWEEN THE DENSIST URBAN CORE AREAS AND THE SURROUNDING ESTABLISHED RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS WHICH ARE INTENDED TO ENSURE THEIR CONTINUED VIABILITY. CAMPUS BUSINESS ZONING DESIGNATIONS OF C1A AND C1AR WERE INTENDED TO BE USED IN VARIOUS LOCATIONS AROUND THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN CENTRAL'S CAMPUS, ADJACENT TO SOME OF THE DENSIST URBAN CORE AREAS OF OUR CITY. THESE CAMPUS BUSINESS ZONING DESIGNATIONS WERE NOT INTENDED TO BE USED OUTSIDE OF THOSE AREAS, AND ANY PROPOSED USE OF THEM OUTSIDE OF THOSE AREAS IS A CLEAR MISAPPLICATION OF THE ZONING AND A VIOLATION OF THE STATED GOALS OF OUR MASTER PLAN. CONTINUED MISAPPLICATION OF C1 AND C1AR ZONING COULD BE HARMFUL TO OTHER NEIGHBORHOODS AROUND UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN PROPERTIES BECAUSE IT COULD ESTABLISH A LEGAL PRECEDENT THAT COULD BE DIFFICULT FOR THE CITY TO DEFEND AGAINST IF ADDITIONAL SIMILAR SPECULATIVE REZONING REQUESTS ARE MADE IN THE FUTURE. A FEW DAYS AGO, I SENT AN EMAIL TO ALL OF THE YOU, CITING MANY OF THE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES STATED IN THIS CENTRAL AREA PORTION OF THE CITY'S MASTER PLAN LAND USE ELEMENT. AND WILE THAT LIST IS TOO LONG TO RECITE AT THIS TIME, THE ABILITY OF THIS PROPERTY'S CURRENT ZONING TO CONFORM TO THOSE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES IS ALL THAT YOU SHOULD CONSIDER WHEN DELIBERATING THIS REZONING REQUEST. BECAUSE ALL OF GOALS IN THE CENTRAL AREA CAN BE REACHED USING THE CURRENT ZONING FOR THIS PROPERTY, THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO REASON TO APPROVE THIS REZONING AT THIS TIME. OUR ZONING LAWS MUST BE FOLLOWED AND OUR MASTER PLAN MUST BE ADHERED TO, BECAUSE THEY HAVE PROVIDED THE STABLE FOUNDATION UPON WHICH OUR CITY'S PROSPERITY BOTH HAS BEEN AND WILL BE CONTINUED -- WILL CONTINUE TO BE BUILT. THANK YOU.
00:56:17.619: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU S. THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING?
00:56:26.194: >> HI, MY NAME IS EDWARD VILAMETTI. SEVERAL OF THE COMMENTS TONIGHT HAVE BEEN REGARDING THE EXPANSION AND USE IN THE CITY OF A CAMPUS BUSINESS DISTRICT, AND -- AND I FOR ONE THINK THAT'S A FINE IDEA. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE USE OF AN EXISTING ZONING PLAN THAT IS DESIGNED TO MEET THE NEEDS, NOT ONLY OF STUDENTS, BUT ALSO PEOPLE WHO WORK AT THE UNIVERSITY AND OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE AFFILIATED WITH THE UNIVERSITY ALLOW US TO GET SOME INCREASED DENSITY IN PLACES THAT ARE AS LITTLE AS A HALF A MILE AWAY FROM UNIVERSITY PROPERTIES. LITERALLY YOU CAN SEE THE UNIVERSITY FROM YOUR FRONT PORCH IF YOUR FRONT PORCH IS CONSTRUCTED CAREY FROM. I THINK -- CONSTRUCTED CAREFULLY. I THINK THE SORT OF MISUNDERSTANDING THAT CAMPUS BUSINESS DISTRICT IS ONLY WHAT IT WAS IN THE '60s OR '70s, I THINK THAT'S A BACKWARD LOOKING PERSPECTIVE. UNIVERSITY HAS GROWN IMMENSELY. THE UNIVERSITY PROVIDES A REMARKABLE AMOUNT OF ECONOMIC VITALITY TO THIS TOWN, AND CITY ZONING SHOULD NOT BE USED TO PREVENT THE SORT OF INCREASED DENSITY AND NATURAL GROWTH THAT COME WHEN YOU HAVE A DYNAMIC SOURCE OF THAT GROWTH POTENTIAL IN YOUR TOWN. FURTHERMORE, YOU KNOW, AS IT HAS BEEN DISCUSSED, THE FOOTPRINT OF THE UNIVERSITY HAS GROWN QUITE A BIT. STRETCHING ALL THE WAY, YOU KNOW, EASILY WITHOUT WORKING TOO HARD FROM BRIARWOOD ALL THE WAY TO EAST ANN ARBOR, BUT LIKE PLYMOUTH ROAD. SO THIS GIVES US AN OPPORTUNITY TO REEVALUATE SOME OF OUR DECISIONS THAT WERE MADE WHEN THAT LAND WAS PRIVATE BUSINESS OR FARM LAND AND I THINK THAT'S A PERFECTLY REASONABLE THING TO DO. YOU MAY HAVE QUESTIONS AS TO WHETHER THE, YOU KNOW, CAMPUS BUSINESS DISTRICT, THE ZONING IS WELL-CONSTRUCTED. THERE'S PROBABLY PERFECTLY REASONABLE CHANGES THAT COULD BE MADE TO MODERNIZE THAT. HEAVEN KNOWS OUR ZONING CODE HAS OLD THINGS THAT WE COULD PROBABLY CHANGE IF WE WANTED TO CHANGE THEM. APPLYING IT WIDELY ACROSS TOWN GIVES US SOME FLEXIBILITY IF WE WANT TO DO IT.
00:59:14.963: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK.
00:59:18.800: >> GOOD EVENING. I REALLY WAS NOT PLANNING TO SPEAK. MY NAME IS JULIE RITTER. AND I DON'T KNOW A LOT ABOUT THIS. I HAVEN'T BEEN PAYING TOO MUCH ATTENTION TO IT. I'M COMING HERE BECAUSE I'M ON THE COMMITTEE TO HELP IDENTIFY THE CONSULTANTS FOR THE NEW MASTER PLAN, AND THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DIFFERENT CONVERSATIONS, DIFFERENT LEVELS OF CONVERSATIONS, BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN TALKED ABOUT IS TO GET AWAY FROM ZONING SPECIFIC PARCELS AND HAVE CHARACTER OVERLAYS OR SOMETHING OF THAT NATURE IN THE FUTURE MASTER PLAN INSTEAD OF ZONING EACH DIFFERENT PARCEL SEPARATELY. THERE'S A LOT MORE EMPHASIS ON NEIGHBORHOODS AND ON THE AREA THAT IT'S SURROUNDING. THIS IS NOT A DOWNTOWN CAMPUS NEIGHBORHOOD. THIS IS WHEELER PARK. IT IS BY THE RIVER. EVERYBODY -- I DON'T HAVE TO GO INTO ALL OF THAT. EVERYBODY HAS DONE A GREAT DEAL OF EXPLANATION. BUT IF THIS IS, AS I READ SOME PLACE, LIKE A DEVELOPER'S LAST PUSH TO GET IN THAT ONE ZONING CHANGE BEFORE THE NEW MASTER PLAN GOES INTO EFFECT, IT'S PRETTY DEPRESSING. IF YOU ARE GOING TO APPROVE THIS, WHY HAVE ZONING AT ALL? WHY BOTHER HAVING ZONING WHEN EVERY TIME A DEVELOPER COMES UP AND WANTS TO UP ZONE A PARCEL, YOU APPROVE IT, EVEN IF IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE NEIGHBORHOOD CHARACTER? THINK I BETTER STOP NOW. THANK YOU. BYE.
01:00:45.520: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING?
01:00:52.093: >> HI, KAREN WHITE, WARD 3. I ALSO THINK IT IS A MISTAKE TO REZONE THE GARNET PARCEL IN THIS MANNER. I THINK HOW CITIZENS GET INVOLVE WITH THE ZONING PROCESS AND THE MASTER PLANNING PROCESS AND THIS SEEMS TO SUBVERT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTICIPATION THAT SHOULD BE AT THE HEART OF THAT. IT SHOULD BE A PUD. I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH A HIGH DENSITY LUXURY DEVELOPMENT, BUT I DO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THEM USING THIS WEIRD DESIGNATION TO SPOT ZONE TO TRY TO GET THAT. I THINK THEY SHOULD COME AT IT THE WAY THE PROCESS SHOULD WORK, AND THAT WAY PARTICIPANTS, CITIZENS GET TO PARTICIPATE. THANK YOU.
01:01:45.613: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING?
01:01:52.720: >> MARK KOROI SPEAKING AGAIN. I THINK THE POINTS MADE ARE VERY WELL TAKEN. I SO HE SEE IT TOO OFTEN. CAMPUS BUSINESS IS NOT AN APPROPRIATE DESIGNATION FROM WHAT EVERYBODY HAS SAID AND I THINK IT'S A MISUSE AND WE SHOULD JUST TRY TO FOLLOW THE PROPER INTENT OF THE ORDINANCE, RATHER THAN TO USE THIS CORRUPTION OF THE -- OF THE ZONING, TO SPOT ZONE TO DO IT -- TO DO IT AS PLANNED. SO I WOULD INCORPORATE SOME OF THE ARGUMENTS OF SOME OF THE PRIOR SPEAKERS SUCH AS MS. CROCKETT, SUCH AS MS. POTTS IN THAT RESPECT. THANK YOU.
01:02:40.301: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU. AND IS THERE ANYONE ELSE? THANK YOU.
01:02:45.239: >> GOOD EVENING. THANK YOU, MEMBERS OF THE ANN ARBOR CITY COUNCIL, FOR YOUR SERVICE AND DEDICATION TO OUR COMMUNITY. MY NAME IS VICTORIA PEBBLES AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER TEAM. I'M NOT GOING TO GET INTO DETAILS ABOUT ZONING. WE HAVE OTHER FOLKS WHO CAN GET INTO, THAT BUT I JUST WANT TO DESCRIBE FOR YOU AND THE AUDIENCE AND REMIND YOU THAT THE GARNET IS A SMALL PROJECT. THE WHOLE SITE IS ONLY JUST OVER 8500 SQUARE FEET. THAT'S LESS THAN ONE-FIFTH OF AN ACRE AND WHILE IT MAY NOT BE DESIGNATED AS THE CORE AREA, IT'S REALLY CLOSE TO WHERE THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER ACTIVITY GOING ON. THERE'S DEVELOPMENT GOING ON, PROPOSED ACROSS THE RIVER FRONT, AND WE'RE TRYING TO DO THIS IN THE MOST SUSTAINABLE WAY POSSIBLE. WE ARE OFFERING CONDITIONS TO LIMIT THE HEIGHT AT AN AVERAGE OF 57 FEET. WE DO CONFORM TO THE MASTER PLAN AS HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY DOCUMENTED IN THE RESPONSES PROVIDED TO CITY COUNCILMEMBERS. AND IT'S REALLY THE SMALLEST SIZE BUILDING IN REVEALMENT THAT'S ECONOMICAL FOR THIS PARTICULAR SITE. AND I WILL TALK ABOUT THE REDEVELOPMENT. THIS IS NOT JUST AN AVERAGE SITE. IT HAS A HISTORY THERE. IT WAS PART OF A COAL GASIFICATION PLANT MANY YEARS AGO AND WE ARE WORKING VERY DILIGENTLY TO COME UP WITH A CLEANUP PLAN THAT IS PART OF THIS AND THAT CAN KEEP THAT CLEANUP COST OUT OF THE CITY COFFERS. AND IT'S ALSO SUPPORTIVE OF THE CURRENT ANTICIPATED COMMERCIAL USES, INCLUDING KERRYTOWN, BUT I WOULD LIKE TO COME BACK THE TO CLEANUP PIECE BECAUSE THAT IS A PUBLIC BENEFIT. IF WE WEREN'TING TO CLEAN THAT UP, THEN -- IF WE WEREN'T GOING TO CLEAN THAT UP, THEN WHO WOULD THAT GO TO? I OFFER THAT FOR YOUR -- FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. SO THERE ARE BENEFITS, CERTAINLY AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS SOMETHING THAT I KNOW IS IMPORTANT TO THE CITY, BUT ISN'T ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY ALSO IMPORTANT? WE HEARD THAT MENTIONED BY AT LEAST ONE COUNCIL PERSON THIS EVENING. SO WE HAVE COMPLETED A BASELINE ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING FOR MORE THAN A YEAR TO COME UP WITH A CLEANUP PLAN. WE MET WITH D.E.Q. AND OTHER FOLKS. FORMERLY D.E. Q. AND NOW EGLE TO COME UP WITH A PLAN. AND SO IT'S CONSISTENT WITH OTHER USES IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA, THE TYPES OF COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE EARLIER ABOUT CARE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. OUR DESIGN IS VERY SENSITIVE AND HISTORIC LOOK AND FEEL OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD. I ENCOURAGE YOU TO LOOK AT IT IF YOU HAVEN'T YET. AND ALSO, I'M VERY PLEASED AND EXCITED BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY RESIDENTS AND BUSINESSES THAT WE HAVE TALKED TO, WHO HAVE EXPRESSED A LOT OF EXCITEMENT ABOUT THE REDEVELOPMENT OF THIS SITE AND THE POTENTIAL NEW OPPORTUNITIES THAT THIS BUILDING THE OFFER FOR THE NEIGHBORHOOD. I WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROJECT AND I URGE YOU TO VOTE IN FAVOR OF POSTPONING THE DECISION UNTIL WE CAN GET YOU THAT INFORMATION SO YOU CAN MAKE IT ON THE BEST AVAILABLE INFORMATION. THANK YOU.
01:05:36.077: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING?
01:05:42.250: >> GOOD EVENING, BRAD MOORE, ARCHITECT FOR THE PROJECT. I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS A COUPLE OF POINTS. THE FIRST IS THE IDEA THAT REQUESTING C1A IS A SPOT ZONING. SPOT ZONING IS NOT THE APPLICABLE TERM HERE, BECAUSE WE ARE NOT BEING PROVIDED OR ASKING FOR ANY USES WHICH ARE NOT ALREADY PERMITTED ON THE SITE. WE ARE ASKING FOR A DIFFERENT FLAVOR OF C1 ZONING. CURRENTLY IT'S C1B AND WE ARE ASKING FOR C1A WITH CONDITIONS. SO THE IDEA THAT THE ZONING IS BEING CHANGED TO ALLOW USES THAT DON'T PREEXIST IS NOT CORRECT. WITH RESPECT TO THE PURPOSE OF C1A ZONING DISTRICT, IN THE VERY FIRST SENTENCE, IN THE ZONING ORDINANCE, IT TALKS ABOUT WHAT THE PRIMARY USE OF THE DISTRICT IS. AND I WANT TO SUGGEST THAT YOU SHOULD NOT CONFLATE EXCLUSIVITY TO PRIMARY. PRIMARY MEANS MAYBE THE FIRST AND FOREMOST, BUT IT DOESN'T EXCLUDE, TERTIARY, AND NON-AREA USES. THOSE OTHER USES ARE ENUMERATED AND THE OTHER PERMITTED CONDITIONS. JUST BECAUSE IT'S PRINCIPALLY FOR ONE THING, DOESN'T EXCLUDE IT FROM DOING OTHER THINGS THAT ARE PERMITTED UNDER THE CODE. THE IDEA THAT THE C1A HAS THE POTENTIAL TO PROLIFERATE THROUGH THE CITY IS SOMETHING I WANT TO ADDRESS. IN THAT STATEMENT OF THE DISTRICT'S INTENT, THE ONE THING THAT IT ABSOLUTELY SAYS THAT MUST HAPPEN IS IT HAS TO BE CLOSE TO THE CENTRAL AREA OF THE CITY. IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE CLOSE TO CAMPUS, BUT IT HAS TO BE CLOSE TO THE CENTRAL AREA OF THE CITY WHICH HAS JENALLY BEEN VIEWED THE DDA -- GENERALLY BEEN VIEWED BY THE DDA BOUNDARY AND WE ARE ONE BLOCK FROM THE DDA. SO THE GLAD I IDEA LA THIS WOULN PLYMOUTH ROAD OR OTHER AREAS DOESN'T COMPORT WITH THE REQUIREMENT IN THE ZONING THAT IT IT BE CLOSE TO THE CENTRAL AREA OF THE CITY. OUR SETBACKS HAVE BEEN CRAFTED SO THAT WE ARE NEARLY 100% IN COMPLIANCE. THE UNUSUAL GEOMETRY OF THE SITE BECAUSE OF A STEEP AND ACUTE ANGLE WHERE IT JOINS BEAKS MEANS WE HAVE A SLIGHT DECREASE IN THE 10-FOOT SETBACK AT THAT CORNER BUT THE AVERAGE ALONG BEAKS IS 13 AND A HALF FEET, WHICH IS MUCH GREATER THAN IS REQUIRED. WE WILL BE HERE TO ANSWER ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. WE HOPE YOU WILL GIVE US A CHANCE TO DEVELOP ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT' REQUESTED AND VOTE TO TABLE IT TONIGHT SO WE CAN COME BACK WITH THAT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.
01:08:26.947: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WOULD WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING?
01:08:36.290: >> HELLO. COUNCIL, MY NAME IS JEFF MAHANEY, I REPRESENT THE DEVELOPMENT GROUP. AND I JUST WANT TO SAY I'M SUPER EXCITED ABOUT THIS PROJECT. I LIVE IN CALIFORNIA I HAVE I LIVE IN SMALL TOWNS. I LIVE IN A TOWN OF 1500 PEOPLE. I LIVED IN THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO. I HAVE LIVED IN OAKLAND, AND I GREW UP IN St. LOUIS. SO I HAVE BEEN IN ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT AREAS AND I HAVE TO SAY THAT EVEN AS A YOUNG PERSON, I WAS ALWAYS PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT WAS HAPPENING AROUND ME. AND ALTHOUGH I DESIGN RESIDENCES MYSELF, I'M ALWAYS VERY COGNIZANT AND AWARE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN MY ENVIRONMENT AROUND ME. WHEN KELLY ASKED ME TO BE PART OF THIS PROJECT, I WAS EXCITED ABOUT IT, JUST BY THE DESCRIPTION. ONCE I CAME HERE TO ANN ARBOR AND I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO TRULY UNDERSTAND THE SETTING, THE PLACE, THIS CITY, I WAS REALLY, REALLY EXCITED ABOUT IT! I SEE THINGS AND I LIKE TO BELIEVE THAT I WANT TO BE PART OF VERY RESPONSIBLE THINGS. I BELIEVE THIS PROJECT IS INCREDIBLY RESPONSIBLE. I HAVE BEEN PART OF THESE NEGOTIATIONS ON CLEANING UP THE SITE, AND DILIGENT AT WORKING TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN, AND NOT HAVE IT COME OUT OF THE -- OF THE ANN ARBOR'S COFFERS. I FEEL THAT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT A PLACE IN MY MIND IS VERY INTERESTING NEIGHBORHOOD. IT'S IN TRANSITION WITH THE RIVER FRONT DEVELOPMENT THAT'S GOING TO TAKE PLACE THERE. I BELIEVE ANN ARBOR AND KERRYTOWN ARE GOING TO FEEL MORE CONNECTED TO THIS -- TO THIS GENERAL AREA. I BELIEVE THIS PROJECT IS ACTUALLY QUITE RESPECTFUL, NOT ONLY TO THE HISTORY OF KERRYTOWN AND THE WAY THAT IT LOOKS, BUT IN ITS SCALE, THAT IT'S A RESIDENTIAL SCALE. YES, IT'S MULTIPLE UNITS, BUT I BELIEVE THAT IT HAS A TRUE RESPECT FOR THIS NEIGHBORHOOD. I PERSONALLY, IF I WERING TO ANN ARBOR WOULD WANT -- IF I WERE TO GO ANN ARBOR, I WOULD WANT TO LIVE IN AREA. I WOULD WANT TO BE ABLE TO WALK TO KERRYTOWN AND GET TO CAMPUS BY BICYCLING OR WALKING. I PERSONALLY FEEL LIKE IT'S EXTREMELY CLOSE TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AND TIED TO IT. I REALLY FEEL LIKE -- THAT I WANT TO MAKE IT REALLY, REALLY CLEAR, THAT I THINK ONE OF THE NEIGHBORS THAT STOOD UP HAD A CONVERSATION WITH KELLY VERY EARLY ON IN THE PROJECT, WHEN WE WERE STILL UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT THE ALLEY, WHICH IS PART OF OUR ADJACENT TO OUR PROPERTY, WAS GOING TO BE PART OF WHAT WE WERE GOING TO BE ABLE TO USE TO DEVELOP THIS PROPERTY. I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO DETAILS. IT'S NOT IMPORTANT, BUT I THINK THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOME MISUNDERSTANDING. SO I KNOW WE ARE HAPPY TO REACH OUT AND HELP GET TO A BETTER UNDERSTANDING THERE. I THINK THE LAST THING IS WE WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THESE MASSING DRAWINGS AND HOPEFULLY HELP CONVINCE ANY COUNCILMEMBERS WOULD ARE RIGHT ON THE FENCE ABOUT THIS, THAT IT IS THE RIGHT PROJECT AT THE RIGHT TIME, IN THE RIGHT PLACE. AND IT'S RESPECTFUL TO ANN ARBOR. THANK YOU.
01:11:36.804: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING?
01:11:45.246: >> HAD HHELLO BEING I'M KATHY KINDNESS. I PREPARED THE SITE PLAN FOR THIS PROJECT. I WANTED TO GIVE YOU SOME BRIEF POINTS TO CONSIDER WHEN LOOKING AT THE BENEFITS THAT THIS PROJECT BRINGS TO THE CITY FROM A SITE PLAN PERSPECTIVE. FIRST OF ALL, OF COURSE, IS THE IMPROVES TO THE ALLEY. THE ALLEY IS IN TERRIBLE CONDITION AND IT WILL BE IMPROVED. WE ARE PROVIDING MORE BICYCLE PARKING THAN IS REQUIRED, A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT MORE. WE ARE PROVIDING MORE VEHICULAR PARKING THAN IS REQUIRED AND MOST IMPORTANTLY IS THE ENVIRONMENTAL CLEANUP. THAT SITE CURRENTLY HAS ABSOLUTELY NO STORMWATER MANAGEMENT ON IT AT ALL. ALL OF THAT WATER INFILL STR INS INTO THE CONTAMINATED GROUND AND SPREADS UNCONTROLLED RIGHT NOW. THIS PROJECT PROPOSES CLEANING UP THAT SITE AND IMPROVING IT WITH THE NORM WATER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM THAT WILL INCLUDE A GREEN ROOF. TO MEET ALL OF THE CITY'S REQUIREMENTS. SO WE WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE IF YOU WOULD CONSIDER GIVING US THE EXTRA TIME TO PREPARE THE EXTRA MATERIALS SO THAT WE CAN PRESENT IT TO YOU FOR YOUR VERY CAREFUL CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU.
01:12:55.916: >> Councilmember Lumm: IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING?
01:13:03.257: >> I'M TOM, AT 1221 TRAVER STREET. IN THE NEWSPAPER BEING THE LAST TIME YOU TALKED ABOUT THIS AT PLANNING COMMISSION, THE BEST THINGS I HEARD ABOUT THIS PROJECT ARE THE BUILDING AND THE SITE PLAN. AND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT NEIGHBORS HAVE SAID AND SUPPORTED THIS PROJECT FOR, BUT THE WORST THINGS ABOUT THIS PROJECT AREN'T SITE PLAN, THEY ARE ZONING AND RIGHT NOW, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ZONING. THIS PUBLIC HEARING AND THE VOTE ARE ABOUT ZONING. THIS IS SIMPLY NOT HOW ZONING IS DONE. CAMPUS BUSINESS DISTRICT ZONING IS NOT APPROPRIATE FOR THIS LOCATION. IT IS NOT APPROPRIATE IN CHARACTER FOR THIS AREA EITHER. IT IS A CORE AREA ZONING. IT'S DESIGNED THAT WAY. CONTRARY TO WHAT SOMEBODY ELSE SAID, THE PLANNING DOCUMENTS FOR YEARS INCLUDING STUDIES IN THE '880s AND OUR A2D2 PROCESS TALK ABOUT CORE AREAS. C1A AND C1AR ARE CORE ZONING CATEGORY AND DO NOT BELONG OUTSIDE THE CORE OR THE AT THE EDGE OF THE CORE AS A TRANSITION. WE ARE KILLING OUR TRANSITIONAL ZONING THAT WE SET UP WITH D2 TRANSITION, IF WE APR AAPPROVE S PROJECT. THIS LETS IN HIGHER INTENSITY DEVELOPMENT OUTSIDE OF OUR D2 TRANSITION ZONING. JUST ACROSS THE STREET FROM THIS PROJECT, IS TWO, TWO-STORY HOUSES, A TWO-STORY APARTMENT AND BEHIND THEM, ANOTHER COUPLE OF TWO-STORY HOUSES THAT ARE ZONED RESIDENTIAL. MASTER PLAN RESIDENTIAL. I BELIEVE IT'S R4C. WITH C1A, COMES THE COMPANION RESIDENTIAL, C1AR. THOSE PROPERTIES WOULD BE RIGHT FOR C1AR AND TEAR DOWN AND BUILDING OF SKYSCRAPER, A DOWNTOWN HIGH-RISE RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET, ENABLED BY THIS REZONING THAT YOU ARE CONSIDERING RIGHT NOW. THIS IS FUZZY ZONING. ESSENTIALLY WE ARE TAKING, IN TERMS OF TRYING TO COMPLY WITH THE MASTER PLAN, WE ARE TAKING A COMMERCIALLY ZONED PROJECT AND REZONING IT TO ANOTHER COMMERCIALLY ZONED CATEGORY. IT WILL HAVE 100% RESIDENTIAL USE, WHICH IS A PERMITTED USE, BUT IT'S NOT THE INTENDED USE OF THE ZONING CATEGORY. AND SO IS THAT COMPATIBLE WITH THE MASTER PLAN, BECAUSE IT'S COMMERCIALLY ZONED BUT RESIDENTIALLY USED? AND WE WILL PUT CONDITIONS TO MAKE IT 100% RESIDENTIAL AND KEEP IT THAT WAY S. IT IS IT COMPATIBLE WHEN IT'S REALLY RESIDENTIAL? IS IT RESIDENTIAL? IS IT COMMERCIAL? IS THAT CLEAR. LET'S GO EVEN FURTHER. SETBACKS ARE DIFFERENT IF YOU HAVE I ACOM A COMMERCIAL BUILDIG VERSUS A RESIDENTIAL BUILDING. PLEASE JUST DENY IT TONIGHT. THANK YOU.
01:15:55.996: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING? SEEING NO OTHER SPEAKERS, THIS PUBLIC HEARING IS CLOSED. PUBLIC HEARING NUMBER THREE IS RESOLUTION TO APPROVE THE GARNET SITE PLAN AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT, 325 EAST SUMMIT STREET. IS THERE ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING.
01:16:24.258: >> I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS A COUPLE OF THINGS. ONE IS THAT THE FACT THAT WE ARE -- OUR PROPOSAL IS NOT JUST C1, IT'S A CONDITIONAL C1A AND SO THE CONDITIONS THAT ARE BEING IMPOSED ARE NOT JUST IN THE RESIDENTIAL USE. THEY ARE ALSO ON THE MAXIMUM F.A.R. THAT COULD BE ACHIEVED AND ALSO THE MAXIMUM HEIGHT ON THE PROJECT. SO THE IDEA THAT WE'RE GOING TO OPEN THE DOOR TO SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE TALL AS A DOWNTOWN BUILDING IS NOT QUITE CORRECT. IF YOU LOOK IN THE C1AR TABLES ON THE ZONING ORDINANCE, YOU WILL SEE THAT IN THEORY, IT HAS A 400% MAXIMUM F.A.R. WITH PREMIUMS. THAT'S A PREMIUM TOTAL THAT'S UNACHIEVABLE BECAUSE OF THE LIMITS IN WHAT PREMIUMS ARE AVAILABLE TO THE C1A ZONING DISTRICT. IN THE D1 AND D2, THERE ARE A WHOLE BUNCH OF DIFFERENT PREMIUMS THAT ARE DENIED TO THE C1A ZONING DISTRICT. AS A MATTER OF FACT, THE MOST YOU CAN GET, IF YOU WERE TO PROVIDE THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF PEDESTRIAN AMENITIES IS 8,000 SQUARE FEET. SO ON A SITE THAT WAS 8,000 SQUARE FEET, THAT WOULD ONLY BE 100% ADDITIONAL F.A.R. SO YOU ARE NOT GOING TO ACHIEVE THE THEORETICAL MAXIMUM OF 400% F.A.R., EVEN IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE CONDITIONS APPLIED TO IT AND WE ARE OFFERING CONDITIONS. FURTHERMORE, TAKING RESIDENTIALLY ZONED PIECE OF LAND IN ESSENCE FOR COMMERCIAL IS SPOT ZONING BECAUSE YOU ARE ALLOWING A DIFFERENT SET OF USES ON A PARCEL THAT DIDN'T PREDATE THE ZONING REQUEST. SO THE IDEA THAT YOU WILL TRY TO TAKE RESIDENTIAL ZONING AND CHANGE IT TO COMMERCIAL ZONING IS A MISDOMER. -- MISNOMER. IT'S NOT WHAT THE PROJECT IS ABOUT AT ALL. AND THERE WAS ALSO A COMMENT ABOUT THE NECESSITY OF THIS HAVING SOME JUXTAPOSITION TO THE UNIVERSITY, AND I WANT TO REITERATE THAT THAT'S ONLY A PRIMARY USE IN THE DISTRICT, NOT ITS SOLE USE.
01:18:31.919: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING?
01:18:41.495: >> CONSIDERING THAT WE HAVE ALL BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE ZONING WHICH IS THE MAIN THING THAT'S BEEN ON SO FAR, I THINK IT'S A LITTLE PREMATURE TO DEAL WITH THE SITE PLAN OR THE DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT. I THINK WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT THE ZONING IS GOING TO BE FOR THIS PROJECT FIRST. THANK YOU.
01:18:59.146: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING? SEEING NO OTHER SPEAKERS, THIS PUBLIC HEARING IS CLOSED. THIS PUBLIC HEARING NUMBER FOUR IS AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND CHAPTE5 (UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE), ZONING OF 1.19 ACRES FROM TWP (TOWNSHIP DISTRICT) TO R1A (SINGLE-FAMILY DWELLING DISTRICT), ERB-DOWNWARD/PICAZO PROPERTY, 2705 NEWPORT ROAD. IS THERE NIP ANYONE WHO WOULD LE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING. SEEING NO SPEAKERS, THIS PUBLIC HEARING IS CLOSED. THAT CONCLUDES OUR PUBLIC HEARINGS TONIGHT. CAN SOMEONE PLEASE MOVE THE MEETING MINUTES OF THE AUGUST 5th REGULAR SESSION AND THE AUGUST 12th SPECIAL SESSION. MOVED BY COUNCIL ACKERMAN, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRAND. ANY DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR, PLEASE SAY AYE. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? THE MINUTES ARE APPROVED. ORDINANCES SECOND READING. ORDINANCE TO AMEND SECTIONS 5.15 (TABLE 5-15), 5.17.3, 5.17.5 (TABLE 5:17-5), AND SECTION 5.37.2 OF CHAPTER 55 (UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE) OF TITLE V OF THE CODE OF THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR (PERMITTED USE TABLE, PARKLAND DONATIONS, DIMENSIONAL STANDARDS TABLE, FRONT LOT LINE) MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN. SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER SMITH. IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR -- OH, COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
01:20:50.757: >> Councilmember Hayner: SORRY, I WAS FIXING MY MICROPHONE.
01:20:53.427: >> Councilmember Lumm: THAT'S OKAY.
01:20:54.261: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I JUST HAD A QUESTION FOR MAYBE -- MAYBE COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN CAN ANSWER THIS, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, YOU ARE SITTING ON PLANNING. SO WE SAW -- WE SEE THE TABLES SET INTO OUR U.D.C. AND SMALL CHANGES CAN RESULT IN BIG CHANGES IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT. IS THERE ANYTHING IN HERE THAT STOOD OUT FOR YOU AS UNUSUAL OR OUT OF LINE WITH WHAT WOULD BE TYPICAL?
01:21:20.520: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  SO ULTIMATELY, I WANT TO DEFER TOMS ANYTHING TO SAY. GENERALLY, THESE ARE ACTUALLYD. LY --FIRST OF ALL, YOU ARE ENTIY RIGHT. THESE TABLES HOLD A LOT OF POWER. AND THE PURPOSE OF THIS IS TO MAKE SURE THAT ANY UNINTENDED CHANGES FROM THE TRANSFER FROM CHAPTER 55 TO THE U.D.C. ARE CORRECTED TO REVERT IT BACK TO THE ORIGINAL INTENT. SO THIS IS ESSENTIALLY TRYING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM YOU JUST ARTICULATED OF UNINTENTIONALLY, YOU KNOW, CARRYING FORWARD CHANGES THAT WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO GET IN THIS. IS THAT A FAIR SUMMARY?
01:21:57.023: >> YEAH. GOOD EVENING, MY NAME IS BORIS IS BRETTLENART, I'M THE PLANNING MANAGER. I WOULD SAY THE MOST SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE TO THESE ELEMENTS BEING PRESENTED ARE THE CHANGE TO FRONT LOT LINE DEFINITIONS, SPECIFICALLY CHANGING HOW WE LOOK AT PROPERTIES WHEN THEY ABUT A HIGHWAY. CURRENTLY OUR FRONT LOT LINE REGULATIONS DESIGNATE MY PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY. SO TECHNICALLY IF YOU HAVE A LOT THAT BACKS UP TO U.S. 23, FOR EXAMPLE, NOW WE COUNT THAT AS A FRONT YARD. THIS WOULD ADDRESS THAT AND ADDRESS IT AS A REAR YARD. THE ONLY FRONT WOULD BE THE PRIMARY STREET TO WHICH THE PROPERTY IS ADDRESSED. OTHER THAN THAT, AS COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN INDICATED, THESE ARE NO CHANGES THAT ARE GOING TO HAVE IMPACTS. THEY ARE ACTUALLY BRINGING FORWARD OUR ORIGINAL REQUIREMENTS AS ADOPTED THAT WERE NOT INCORPORATED IN THE FIRST DRAFT OF THE U.D.C. THAT WAS DRAFTED LAS YEAR.
01:22:54.614: >> Councilmember Hayner:  IS IT OKAY?
01:22:56.349: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES, COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
01:22:57.918: >> Councilmember Hayner:  WE HAVE A LOCAL SITUATION IN WARD 1, WHERE WE HAVE A PUBLIC STREET THAT REALLY IS NOW FUNCTIONING AS A PARKING LOT, AND I THINK YOU ARE FAMILIAR. IT'S THE PONTIAC STREET ADDRESS THAT'S ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE NORTH SIDE GRILL. AND, YOU KNOW, THE PARKING LOT THAT EFFECTIVELY RUNS BETWEEN NORTH SIDE GRILL AND THE OLD GAS STATION IS ACTUALLY AN ADDRESSED STREET. IT'S 1405 PONTIAC STREET OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. IT'S A CITY STREET. DO HAVE ANY EFFECT ON THIS? WOULD THAT BE CHANGED BY THESE TABLE CHANGES?
01:23:29.449: >> IF IT WERE DESIGNATED A STREET, AS YOU INDICATED, THEN IT WOULD NOT. IF IT IS DESIGNATED AN ALLEY, AS I THINK IT IS, THEN WE WOULD NO LONGER COUNT THE PORTIONS OF THE PROPERTY THAT FRONT THAT AS A FRONT YARD. THEY WOULD BECOME SIDE YARDS INSTEAD OF FRONT YARDS.
01:23:46.399: >> Councilmember Hayner:  AND DOES THAT HAVE ANY EFFECT ON THE USE OF THE -- THE NOW ABANDONED GAS STATION BUILDING?
01:23:51.671: >> IT WOULD REDUCE, ESSENTIALLY THE SETBACK REQUIREMENTS FROM THE BUILDING TO THAT ALLEY, BUT IT WOULDN'T HAVE ANY IMPACT ON THE PERMITTED USES AT THAT LOCATION.
01:24:01.081: >> Councilmember Hayner: YEAH, I THOUGHT IT WAS DESIGNATED AS ALLEY, AND THEN I WENT UPSTAIRS TO ASSESSMENT AND LOOKED AT ONE OF THE MAPS AND IT'S SHOWING AS A -- IT'S ON THERE AS A STREET, IF YOU CAN BELIEVE THAT. AND WE ACTUALLY REPAVED IT A FEW YEARS BACK, AS PART OF THE STREET REPAVING PROJECTS. SO, YOU KNOW, THERE WERE SOME -- THERE'S SOME EFFORTS TO DEVELOP THAT BUILDING IN THAT SPACE AND THAT PARKING LOT FURTHER. I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WAS NOT GOING TO STRANGLE THOSE EFFORTS BECAUSE I THINK THOSE FOLKS HAVE HAD A DIFFICULT TIME GETTING THROUGH THE SYSTEM.
01:24:33.446: >> AGAIN, IF THAT WERE A STREET, IT WOULD HAVE NO CHANGE. IF IT WERE AN ALLEY, IT WOULD HAVE THE BENEFIT OF EYE ESSENTIAL -- OF ESSENTIALLY PROVIDING MORE DEVELOPMENT AREA FOR THOSE SITES.
01:24:42.255: >> Councilmember Hayner:  OH, OKAY. THANK YOU.
01:24:45.058: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS? COMMENTS? ALL IN FAVOR, PLEASE SAY AYE. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT PASSES. B2, AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND THE ZONING MAP, BEING A PART OF SECTION 5:10.2 OF CHAPTER 55 OF TITLE V OF THE CODE OF ANN ARBOR, REZONING OF 0.2 ACRE FROM C1B (COMMUNITY CONVENIENCE CENTER DISTRICT) TO C1A (CAMPUS BUSINESS DISTRICT) WITH CONDITIONS, THE GARNET REZONING, 325 EAST SUMMIT STREET. MOVED BY? COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD. SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER. IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION? COUNCIL MEMBER HAYNER.
01:25:33.039: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANKS. I'LL START. I DID SEE THAT A LETTER GOT CIRCULATED AROUND ASKING FOR A -- I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS FOR THE SITE PLAN TO BE POSTPONED OR FOR THIS REZONING TO BE POSTPONED. I DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE TO READ IT FULLY. I WASN'T GOING TO PLAN ON BRINGING THAT FORWARD IN ANY EVENT. I'M HAPPY TO COMMENT ON THE REZONING ASPECT.
01:25:56.229: >> Councilmember Lumm: BOTH.
01:25:56.830: >> Councilmember Hayner:  IT WAS BOTH?
01:25:58.465: >> Councilmember Lumm: CORRECT.
01:25:59.132: >> Councilmember Hayner:  ALL RIGHT. LET ME TALK ABOUT WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY ABOUT THE REZONING. I APPRECIATE EVERYBODY COMING DOWN HERE AND SPEAKING TO IT, AND THE DEVELOPERS ALSO SPEAKING TO IT. AND I HAD SOME CONCERNS THAT WERE ADDRESSED AT THE -- OR AT LEAST SPOKEN TO AT THE VERY END. THE DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT FOR THE SITE PLAN, UNDER THIS REZONING IS -- IN SECTION P14 IS PRETTY WEAK WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE -- I MEAN, I HAVE SEVERAL CONCERNS ABOUT THIS PARCEL. NOT LEAST AMONG THEM IS THE POLLUTION THAT EXISTS ON THIS PARCEL. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU FOLKS HAVE BEEN UP THERE, BUT THERE'S ABOUT A DOZEN MONITORING WELLS ON THIS SITE AND THE TWO ADJACENT SITES. AND THEY ARE OFFICIAL. THEY HAVE WELL MONITORING NUMBER AND IT SHOWS WHAT THEY ARE LOOKING FOR IF YOU CARE TO LOOK UP THE TABLE. IT'S A LOT. AND SO THERE'S DEFINITELY A CONTAMINATION SITUATION ON THIS SITE AND I WAS KIND OF STARTLED TO SEE THAT IN THE DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT, AS PART OF THIS REZONING, IT WAS -- IT WAS REFERRED TO AS A SUMP. AND SO THE WATERS ARE COLLECTING IN THE SUMP AND THEY GET KICKED INTO THE STORM DRAIN AND THEREBY DIRECTLY INTO THE RIVER. AND SO THIS IS AN ONGOING SPREAD OF THIS CONTAMINATION AND IN SPEAKING WITH SOME OF THE ADJACENT PROPERTY OWNER IT'S THIS AFTERNOON, THEY EXPRESSED THE SAMECERNS. THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO REACH OUT TO D.E.Q./EGLE TO SEE WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN WITH THAT. ONE OF THE GENTLEMAN TOLD ME THAT D.E.Q. WANTS TO REMOVE 4 FEET OF PARCEL AND THIS IS IMMEDIATELY DOWNSTREAM OF THIS ONE. I HAVE CONCERNS THAT THIS HAS BEEN ALLOWED TO GO ON SO LONG. AND NOW, WHEN WE TALK ABOUT INCREASED DENSITY ON THIS SITE, AND THAT'S WHAT THIS WOULD DO, IT WOULD ALLOW INCREASED DENSITY AND REDEVELOPMENT OF IT, I MEAN, I OFTEN THINK THAT IF DENSITY IS A MEANS, YOU KNOW, WHAT IS THE DESTINATION? ARE WE -- ARE WE INCREASING DENSITY FOR A PURPOSE TO GO WITH OUR MASTER PLAN? ARE WE INCREASING DENSITY BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT SUPPLY AND DEMAND IS SUCH A SIMPLE -- A SIM I AM CONCEPT THAT MORE -- A SIMPLE CONCEPT THAT MORE SUPPLY WILL MEET OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING GOALS AND WE SEE THAT THAT IS NOT THE CASE WITH THIS ONE. THERE IS NOTHING CONSIDERED AFFORDABLE ABOUT THIS. MY BIG OBJECTION TO THIS IS AN ECHO TO WHAT MANY PEOPLE SPOKE TO. THIS IS A ZONING CHANGE AND ZONING CHANGES ARE BASED ON LAW AND NEED AND NOT WISHFUL THINKING. AND MY CONCERNS ABOUT THIS ARE THAT WHEN SOMEONE COMES TO US, AND CITY COUNCIL AND ASKS FOR A ZONING CHANGE, TO ALLOW A PROJECT NO MOVE FORWARD THAT IS NOT THE PROJECT THAT IS AVAILABLE UNDER THE CURRENT ZONING, IT'S -- IT'S -- I THINK IT'S INCUMBENT UPON US TO LOOK AT THAT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT WHAT ARE OUR GOALS AS A CITY WHEN IT COMES TO DEVELOPING THESE VARIOUS PARCELS. ARE THEY IN KEEPING SOLELY WITH THE MASTER PLAN, WHICH SAYS THAT, YOU KNOW -- THAT THIS AREA SHOULD BE WHAT IT IS NOW, WHICH IS A NEAR BUSINESS AREA, A LOW-KEY MIXED USE? ARE THEY -- ARE THEY AFFORDABLE HOUSING GOALS? YOU KNOW, WHAT IS THE PUBLIC BENEFIT? AND I KNOW THE DEVELOPER SPOKE TO THE IDEA THAT THE PUBLIC BENEFIT IS THAT THEY ARE GOING TO SOMEHOW CLEAN THIS UP, AND THE CITY IS NOT GOING TO GET STUCK THE BILL. AND -- AND AS A PERSON WHO IS VERY INTERESTED SENATE OF OUR WATER -- SAFETY OF OUR WATERS AND OUR GREAT LAKES WATER BEING I'M CONCERNED THAT IT HAS GONE ON THIS LONG WITHOUT AN EFFORT TO CLEAN IT YOU. I DON'T SEE THAT CLEANUP AS A PUBLIC BENEFIT, NECESSARILY, COMMENSURATE WITH THE GRANTING OF THIS REZONING. I THINK THAT WHEN YOU ASK THE CITY TO REZONE SOMETHING, THAT YOU HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE A NEED, AND IT'S NOT -- NO OFFENSE TO PERSONAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OR DEVELOPMENT, BUT THE NEED ISN'T TO SHIFT YOUR BOTTOM LINE AROUND, SO THAT YOU CAN PROFIT OFF OF THIS. THE NEED IS THE CITY'S NEED, AND THE NEEDS FOR THE CITY'S GOALS. AND I WAS TOLD ALL THE WAY UP TO TODAY, TO WHEN I DECIDED TO RUN FOR COUNCIL, THAT THE CITY HAS AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROBLEM AND WE ARE LOOKING TO CREATE MIXED USE NEIGHBORHOODS THAT REDUCE THE RELIANCE ON MOTOR VEHICLES AND THINGS. WE ARE THROWING BOTH OF THESE THINGS AWAY. IT'S NOT SUITABLE FOR ME TO ALLOW THIS REZONING. IT'S -- A REZONING REQUEST SHOULD BE A CARROT THAT WE DANGLE IN FRONT OF PEOPLE TO GET WHAT WE WANT. AND I DON'T SEE THAT IN THIS CASE. THIS ISN'T WHAT -- I DON'T BELIEVE THIS IS WHAT OUR MASTER PLAN WANTS. I DON'T BELIEVE THIS IS THE DIRECTION WE ARE HEADED IN AND RIGHT ON THE EVE OF A NEW MASTER PLAN, MS. RITTER POINTED OUT, PERHAPS THIS IS THE NOT DECISION WE SHOULD BE MAKING. THERE'S NO NEED THAT'S BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO ME. I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS REZONING, I'M SORRY TO SAY, TO THOSE WHO DO.
01:31:10.309: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER. I WOULD ASK, SINCE THE DEVELOPER HAS REQUESTED A POSTPONEMENT TO THE SEPTEMBER 16th MEETING, BEFORE WE CONTINUE THIS DISCUSSION, WOULD ANY COUNCILMEMBER LIKE TO MAKE ANY MOTION FOR POSTPONEMENT?
01:31:29.429: >> Councilmember Smith: I WILL DO SO.
01:31:32.832: >> Councilmember Lumm: MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER SMITH AND SUPPORTED BY COUNCILMEMBER NELSON. COUNCILMEMBER EATON, SEPTEMBER 16th WAS THE REQUEST.
01:31:42.575: >> Councilmember Eaton: SO I APPRECIATE THAT THE DEVELOPER HAS ASKED TO POSTPONE THIS TO GIVE THEM TIME TO PROVIDE THE DRAWINGS THAT YOU ASKED FOR SOMETIME AGO. BUT I DON'T THINK THAT A SET OF DRAWING THAT WE'RE LIKELY TO GET WILL BE DETERMINATIVE OF WHETHER OR NOT WE SHOULD GRANT THE REZONING. IT -- I THINK THAT IT'S MORE GERMANE TO THE ISSUE OF THE SITE PLAN. AND I DON'T NECESSARILY OPPOSE THIS PARTICULAR BUILDING. BUT I DO VERY VIGOROUS OPPOSE THE USE OF CAMPUS BUSINESS DISTRICT ZONING IN THIS LOCATION. SO I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THERE'S ANY REASON TO POSTPONE THE ZONING DECISION FOR DRAWINGS THAT REALLY RELATE MOSTLY TO THE SITE PLAN DECISION. AND SO I WOULD HOPE THAT WE DON'T POSTPONE IT, THAT WE VOTE ON THE ZONING, AND DETERMINE WHETHER THIS PARTICULAR LOCATION IS SUITABLE FOR THIS PARTICULAR ZONING DISTRICT. WHICH I DON'T BELIEVE IT IS.
01:32:56.015: >> Councilmember Lumm: OKAY. THANK YOU. FURTHER DISCUSSION TO THE POSTPONEMENT? COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN?
01:33:03.823: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MAYOR, PRO TEM. I WILL THROW A SLIGHT WRENCH INTO THAT, COUNCILMEMBER EATON. I THINK WHEN DEALING WITH CONDITIONAL REZONINGS, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT CONDITIONS THAT COULD BE PUT IN, AND IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE PUBLIC TO UNDERSTAND THAT CONDITIONS HAVE TO BE VOLUNTEERED BY THE DEVELOPER. THEY ARE NOT THINGS THAT WE CAN ASK FOR UNDER STATE LAW. OTHER PROPOSALS THAT WE HAVE COME ACROSS THAT DEAL WITH CONDITIONAL REZONINGS HAVE OFFERED STRONGER CONDITIONS. SO IF WE WERE TO POSTPONE, I WOULD ALSO LOOK TO THE DEVELOPER TO SEE WHAT ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS THEY MAY MUSE AS THEIR OWN TEAM AND PERHAPS VOLUNTEER HERE. AND SO IN THAT, I WOULD -- THE -- YOU KNOW, THERE'S THE POTENTIAL OF INTRINSICALLY LINKING SITE PLAN TO REZONING IN A WAY THAT I THINK CREATES A BETTER PROPOSAL FOR OUR CONSIDERATION, AND MORE CERTAINTIES AT THE COMMUNITY, POTENTIALLY, OBVIOUSLY, BECAUSE IT HAS TO BE THEIR DECISION, THE DEVELOPER, THAT IS. SO INSERTING THAT INTO THE CONVERSATION, I THINK POSTPONEMENT WOULD BE APPLICABLE TO BOTH THE REZONING AND THE SITE PLAN AND I THINK SEPTEMBER 16th, IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU COME BACK TO US WITH, THAT THAT'S JUST A BETTER PROPOSAL FOR US TO CONSIDER WHETHER OR NOT WE VOTED UP OR DOWN.
01:34:23.169: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, TO THE POSTPONEMENT?
01:34:28.674: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES. I'M WONDERING IF THERE'S ANY CONSIDERATION THAT THE CLEANUP AGREEMENT COULD BE HASHED OUT BETWEEN NOW AND THEN. THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING I WOULD BE MOST INTERESTED IN SEEING. I DON'T KNOW WHO WOULD ANSWER THAT, BUT --
01:34:41.254: >> Councilmember Lumm: PERHAPS THAT'S A QUESTION TO BE ANSWERED BY MR. LENART OR THE PETITIONER.
01:34:45.791: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU.
01:34:48.361: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU, MR. LENART.
01:34:50.029: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I MEAN, SINCE WE ARE CONSIDERING POSTPONING TO GIVE ADDITIONAL TIME TO GET THINGS TOGETHER, THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S MISSING.
01:34:56.569: >> SO FROM THE CITY PERSPECTIVE, SINCE AS WE DON'T HAVE SPECIFIC REGULATIONS, CLEANUP STANDARDS SET AT THE CITY APART FROM THE STATE, WHAT WE COULD DO, I THINK, IS TO REFINE THAT -- ANY PROPOSED LANGUAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT TO ADD SOME MORE DETAIL ABOUT HOW THAT CLEANUP WOULD BE CONDUCTED UNDER THE STATE OVERSITE. IT WOULDN'T NECESSARILY INTERJECT ANY LOCAL STANDARDS, BUT WE COULD CERTAINLY DO OUR BEST TO TRY TO CLARIFY WHAT EXPECTATIONS STATE WOULD BE HOLDING TO THAT SITE AND WHAT THE END RESULT WOULD BE ANTICIPATED.
01:35:34.440: >> Councilmember Hayner:  IS IT -- SHOULD I OR SOMEONE ELSE LOOK UP THE CODES ON THESE MONITORING WELLS TO SEE WHAT HAS BEEN BEING MONITORED THERE? DOES THAT SHEDY? SHED ANY LIGHT ON THESITUATION?
01:35:49.488: >> THAT'S SOMETHING WE COULD CONSULT THE STATE WITH. THEY ARE THE REGULATORY AGENCY FROM THE CONTAMINATION. I WOULD START FROM THAT REALM AND THEN CERTAINLY LEAD IT TO THE PETITIONER IF THEY HAVE ANY MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THAT SPECIFIC APPROACH.
01:36:00.733: >> Councilmember Hayner:  OH, OKAY.
01:36:04.036: >> Councilmember Eaton: WHILE HE'S UP HERE, CAN I ASK HIM A QUESTION?
01:36:07.740: >> Councilmember Lumm: OF COURSE. COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
01:36:12.578: >> Councilmember Eaton: THOSE ISSUES BEING DEVELOPED IN THE DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT COULD BE DONE INDEPENDENT OF THE DECISION OF THE ZONING. THIS PROJECT COULD COME BACK WITH A DIFFERENT ZONING CLASSIFICATION AND WE COULD STILL ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS ABOUT THE POLLUTION ON THE SITE AND THE OTHER CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE ABOUT THE -- THE DEVELOPMENT?
01:36:33.666: >> YES, AS LONG AS THE EVENTUAL SITE PLAN THAT'S CONSIDERED IS COMPATIBLE WITH THE ZONING DISTRICT, WHATEVER THAT IS PROPOSED.
01:36:40.406: >> Councilmember Eaton: THANK YOU. LULZ THANK YOU. --
01:36:42.742: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU. MR. MOORE, ANYBODY -- COUNCILMEMBERS HAVE ANY OBJECTIONS TO MR. MOORE ADDRESSING THIS QUESTION? THANK YOU. MR. MOORE.
01:36:52.151: >> I JUST WANTED TO ADDRESS TWO THINGS. WE WOULD LIKE MORE TIME TO WORK WITH STAFF TO PERHAPS AMEND THE CONDITIONS TO MORE CLOSELY FOLLOW THE ENVIRONMENTAL CLEANUP PROCEDURES AND LEVELS OF THE SITE. TO COUN COUNCILMAN HAINEER'S POT ABOUT THE STORMWATER AND THE SUMP PUMP THIS SITE IF USED FOR RESIDENTIAL PURPOSES HAS TO BE CLEANED UP TO A HIGHER STANDARD THAN IF PUT TO COMMERCIAL USES. SO BY USING IT AS A RESIDENTIAL USE, THERE'S A BETTER LEVEL OF CLEANUP, NUMBER ONE. NUMBER TWO, THE SUMP PUMP YOU WERE DESCRIBING IS AT THE LEVEL OF THE LOWER BASEMENT SLAB. THE CONTAMINATED MATERIAL WOULD BE REMOVED BELOW THAT LEVEL, AND THEN CLEAN FILL BROUGHT IN ON TOP. SO THE WATER THAT WOULD THEORETICALLY PERCOLATE DOWN THROUGH THE SOILS TO REACH THAT SUMP PUMP WOULD NOT BE GOING THROUGH THE CONTAMINATED SOIL BUT THE FRESH SOIL BROUGHT TO THE SITE. SO THAT SUMP PUMP IS NOT PUMPING OUT CONTAMINANTS INTO THE STORM SEWER. THANK YOU.
01:37:55.581: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, AGAIN. MR. MOORE, COULD YOU RETURN TO THE PODIUM, PLEASE. SORRY. IT APPEARS COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER HAS ANOTHER QUESTION.
01:38:04.123: >> Councilmember Hayner:  SO THE SUMP PUMP, THAT'S THE FUTURE SUMP PUMP? WHAT IS GOING ON ON THE SITE.
01:38:11.363: >> I DON'T HAVE ANY FAMILIARITY WITH THE EXISTING BUILDING.
01:38:14.934: >> Councilmember Hayner:  OH,
01:38:17.903: >> Councilmember Lumm: MR. LENAR T, CAN YOU RESPOND TO COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER'S QUESTION.
01:38:23.642: >> AGAIN, I DON'T KNOW THE DETAILS ABOUT THOSE MONITORING WELLS AND WHAT THEY ARE BEING UTILIZED FOR, TO -- RELATIVE TO THIS, THERE WAS AN AGENDA QUESTION THAT I WILL REITERATE IS THAT THE LANGUAGE YOU ARE -- I THINK YOU ARE -- YOU MIGHTING FEELING SOME CONFLICT ON THE PROPOSED PROJECT IS GOING TO CLEAN UP THE SITE, BUT WE HAVE THIS LANGUAGE THAT SAYS WE STILL HAVE THE OPTION IF WE IDENTIFY SOMETHING. AND SIMPLY THE REASON FOR THAT IS CONTAMINATION UNDERGROUND DOESN'T FOLLOW PROPERTY BOUNDARIES. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHILE THEY STEP ALL THE NECESSARY STEPS WITHIN THEIR CONTROL AND PURVIEW, IF WE IDENTIFY A PROBLEM BECAUSE OF OFFSITE OR OTHER ANCILLARY IMPACTS, WE WANT THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO IT VIA THE SYSTEM.
01:39:06.752: >> I >> Councilmember Hayner:  T I THINK THAT WOULD BE IN KEEPING WITH 320 DEPOT WHO SHARED HIS CONCERNS ABOUT THE CHANGES TO THE PROPERTY AFFECTING, YOU KNOW, LIKE WHEN YOU GET A GRATING PERMIT, YOU CAN'T FOIST STUFF ON YOUR NEIGHBORS. SO THERE ARE -- I MEAN, THE WHOLE -- THAT WHOLE AREA IS READY FOR A CLEANUP, OBVIOUSLY. - WE HAVE A LOT MORE WATER CONCERNS THAN WE LET ON HERE IN THE CITY, I'M SORRY TO SAY. AND I'M GLAD WE ARE -- I'M GLAD THEY ARE BROUGHT TO THE FOREFRONT AND THAT WE ARE RECOGNIZING IT AND DEALING WITH IT.
01:39:39.151: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU. COUNCILMEMBER NELSON?
01:39:41.654: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I'M GLAD FOR THE OPPORTUNITY FOR A POSTPONEMENT. SINCE THE LAST MEETING, THERE'S BEEN SORT OF A FLURRY OF EMAILS AROUND -- FROM OUR LEGAL DEPARTMENT IN TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE RAMIFICATIONS OF THIS PARTICULAR REZONE WOULD BE, AND I'M ENCOURAGED BY THE POSSIBILITY THAT THIS DEVELOPMENT WILL BRING ABOUT CLEANUP. I SHARE CONCERNS EXPRESSED ABOUT US BEING ON JUST THE EVE OF REASSESSMENT OF OUR MASTER PLAN. I THINK THESE ARE COMPELLING ARGUMENTS TO GIVE US PAUSE. SO I WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY FOR A POSTPONEMENT SO WE CAN SORT OF GET -- HAVE A CLEARER UNDERSTANDING OF THE SITUATION.
01:40:22.995: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU. I WILL JUST SAY FOR ME, THAT I DID NOT SUPPORT THE REZONING AT FIRST READING AND MY POSITION HAS NOT CHANGED. THE REZONING TO C1A CAMPUS BUSINESS DISTRICT, IS IN MY VIEW INAPPROPRIATE, FOR MANY REASONS I WILL GET INTO IF WE DON'T POSTPONE THIS TONIGHT. BUT IN SOME CAMPUS BUSINESS DISTRICT IS INTENDED FOR BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT TO SERVICE THE SURROUNDING STUDENTS IN THE CAMPUS AREA AND THIS PROPOSAL IS NEITHER A BUSINESS, NOR IN A CAMPUS AREA SURROUNDED BY STUDENT POPULATION. PLUS, I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE PRECEDENT-SETTING ASPECT OF UTILIZING AN INAPPROPRIATE FORCE FIT ZONING CLASSIFICATION FORBE THE PURPOSES OF -- FOR THE PURPOSES OF DENSITY. MANY OF US EXPRESSED THAT CONCERN ON LOWURETOWN C1AR ZONING, AND HERE'S ANOTHER ONE. THE DEVELOPER HAS REQUESTED A POSTPONEMENT UNTIL THE SEPTEMBE. THE STATE AND THE INTENT OF THE POSTPONEMENT IS TO ALLOW MASSING DRAWINGS TO BE COMPLETED AND TO ALLOW THE DEVELOPER TO CONTEMPLATE FURTHER CONDITIONS. CERTAINLY HAVING THESE DRAWINGS WILL BE INFORMATIVE, BUT, ACTUALLY, THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN PROVIDED EARLIER, WHEN REQUESTED BY CITY STAFF BUT THE DEVELOPER REJECTED THAT REQUEST. IN TERMS OF POTENTIAL CHANGES TO THE CONDITIONS, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE DEVELOPER IS CONTEMPLATING AND CHANGES TO THE CONDITIONS COULD BE RELEVANT, BUT I DO NOT SUPPORT THE BASE C1A ZONING REGARDLESS OF THE CONDITIONS ATTACHED TO IT. TYPICALLY IN THE PAST, COUNCIL HAS HONORED DEVELOPERS' REQUESTS FOR POSTPONEMENT AND I'M OKAY WITH DOING THAT, IF THAT'S COUNCIL'S DESIRE. AND I'M WILLING TO VOTE ON IT. IT'S PROBABLY BETTER THAT THE DEVELOPER KNOW RATHER THAN LATER SO THEY CAN GO TO WORK ON MORE APPROPRIATE ZONING IF THAT'S THE DEVELOPER PLEASURE. I'M COMFORTABLE EITHER WAY ON POSTPONEMENT, I APPRECIATE HEARING WHAT OTHER COUNCILMEMBERS HAVE HAD TO SAY AND OTHERS MAY WANT TO ALSO CHIME IN ON THIS POSTPONEMENT. I DO THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, THE PUBLIC BENEFIT HAS BEEN NOTED, AND THAT IS CERTAINLY WITH PUD ZONING A PUBLIC BENEFIT MUST BE IDENTIFIED AND -- AND A PUBLIC BENEFITS ARE IDENTIFIABLE WITH THIS PROJECT. SO KNOWING THAT, RECOGNIZING THAT, APPRECIATING THAT DOESN'T APPEAR THAT A DIFFERENT REZONING CLASSIFICATION WOULD BE PROBLEMATIC IN THAT REGARD. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO THE POSTPONEMENT? OKAY. COUNCILMEMBER BEAUDRY -- COUNCILMEMBER? CLERK. SORRY. I DEMOTED YOU. SORRY. MY APOLOGIES.
01:43:25.277: >> THAT IS A DEMOTION.
01:43:31.750: >> Councilmember Lumm: SORRY.
01:43:33.252: >> Councilmember Eaton: NO.
01:43:33.852: >> Councilmember Nelson:  YES.
01:43:37.089: >> Councilmember Smith: YES.
01:43:37.689: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES.
01:43:41.226: >> Councilmember Hayner NO.
01:43:44.229: >> Councilmember Bannister: NO.
01:43:44.963: >> Councilmember Griswold: NO.
01:43:48.867: >> Councilmember Lumm: NO.
01:43:49.468: >> Councilmember Grand: YES.
01:43:50.068: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES.
01:43:51.069: >> Clerk Beaudry: THE MOTION FAILS. OKAY.
01:43:58.277: >> Councilmember Lumm: OKAY. SO TO THE MAIN MOTION. COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
01:44:03.015: >> Councilmember Bannister: AS SOME OF YOU KNOW, I HAVE BEEN MEETING -- OR MET WITH THE DEVELOPERS EARLIER ON AND I HOPE I WAS HELPFUL WHEN WE WORKED THROUGH SOME OF THE ISSUES OF THE ALLEY AND THINGS LIKE THAT. AND I HAVE BEEN POLLING MY RESIDENTS, WARD 1 RESIDENTS WITH COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, AND AS WE SAW TONIGHT, DURING THE PUBLIC COMMENTS, WE SAW TEN PEOPLE -- TEN RESIDENTS SPEAK, TWO WERE FOR IT AND EIGHT WERE AGAINST IT. AND NOT -- AND I WANT TO CLARIFY, IT IS NOT THE BUILDING. EVERYONE SEEMS RELATIVELY -- YOU KNOW, HAPPY WITH THE BUILDING. VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE ALLEY GETTING FIXED. VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENTAL CLEANUP THROUGH THE STORMWATER MANAGEMENT. AND OVERALL, PLEASED WITH THE PROJECT. BUT ASIDE FROM THE PROJECT, THE BIG PROBLEM THAT WE HEARD TONIGHT AND THAT I HAVE BEEN HEARING VERY INTENSELY FOR WEEKS, IS THAT C1A ZONING CAN BE USED TO UPZONE OTHER PROPERTIES AND THAT HAS DIRE RAMIFICATIONS AND CONSEQUENCES BEYOND THIS SITE. AND THAT IS WHAT I FOUND THROUGH EXTENSIVE RESEARCH AND DISCUSSION WITH A BUNCH OF -- A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE, AND SO TO ARE THAT REASON, I CANNOT APPROVE THIS SITE REPRESENTING THE WARD 1 RESIDENTS AS A C1A ZONING AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE LOOKING AT OTHER ZONING OPTIONS FOR THIS SAME BUILDING.
01:45:57.396: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:46:00.165: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, MAYOR PRO TEM. I HAVE BEEN QUIET ALL NIGHT, AND I WAS HOPING THAT THE POSTPONEMENT WOULD SUCCEED SO WE WOULD HAVE MORE SOAK TIME. THERE'S A LOT TO THINK ABOUT. AND LIKE MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID, THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF INFORMATION GOING BACK AND FORTH IN LAST WEEK. BUT WE HAVE BEEN REMINDED A FEW TIMES TONIGHT THAT THIS IS ABOUT A ZONING REQUEST AND NOT SITE PLAN OR DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT. SO HERE WE ARE DECIDING ON THAT IN THE SECOND READING. WE HAVE HEARD ABOUT THE PUBLIC BENEFIT, AND ONE IS OBVIOUSLY THE POLLUTION. I DO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT, THAT BUT, AGAIN, THAT WILL HAVE TO BE TALKED ABOUT AND DECIDED WITH A DIFFERENT VOTE. BUT THE ARGUMENTS BEING MADE THAT THIS WOULD SET PRECEDENT AND HAVE GREATER RAMIFICATIONS, I -- I HAVE A HARD TIME BELIEVING THAT, BASED ON THE LEGAL ADVICE THAT WE HAVE BEEN GIVEN, THAT THIS WOULD OPEN THE FLOODGATES TO THE AGREE THAT WE HAVE BEEN TOLD IT MAY HAPPEN. SO I JUST -- I JUST DON'T SEE THAT. I'M NOT CONVINCED THAT IT'S GOING TO. WE HAVE BEEN ON COUNCIL NOW FOR A YEAR ALMOST, NEW MEMBERS MYSELF, WE HAVE HAD A LOT OF REQUESTS FOR ZONING CHANGES, AND THIS IS -- THIS IS ONE THAT I'M GOING TO GO AGAINST WHAT MOST PEOPLE THINK I WOULD SAY. AND I SUPPORT THIS. I THINK, YOU KNOW, WE EVENTUALLY HAVE TO SAY YES THIS IS A LESS THAN A QUARTER OF AN ACRE. IT'S NEAR THE CORE. IT'S NEAR SHOPPING. IT'S NEAR THE AMENITIES. IT'S NEAR MAJOR DEVELOPMENT. IT'S NEAR THE TRAIN STATION. I MEAN, IT -- IT -- TO ME, IT ES LEND ITSELF TO THE BENEFITS THAT WE WANT TO SEE IN OUR COMMUNITY. WE WANT TO SEE MORE WALKABILITY, LESS CAR DEPENDENCY. CLEANUPOF CONTAMINATED SITES. MORE DENSITY. WE NEED MORE HOUSING STOCK. YES, THIS DOESN'T BRING US AFFORDABLE HOUSING, BUT IF ANYONE HAS BEEN IN THE BUILDING TRADES LATELY, IT'S NOT EASY TO BUILD. YOU WON'T GET AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN MANY OF THESE AREAS. THAT'S THE REALITY. HERE WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE SOME MORE UNITS, DESPERATELY NEEDED, AND THE ARGUMENTS AGAINST IT DO NOT -- DO NOT PERSUADE ME TO VOTE AGAINST IT. I AM FOR THIS AT THIS POINT, AND I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR MORE, BECAUSE RIGHT NOW, IT'S -- THAT'S WHERE I STAND.
01:49:34.646: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU. COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
01:49:39.351: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES, I WANT TO RESTATE THAT I AM FOR THIS BUILDING. AND GIVEN THE BENEFITS THAT WERE OUTLINED TONIGHT AND THE FACT THAT IT WOULD QUALIFY BASED ON WHAT WE KNOW FOR A PUD, WHY TAKE THE RISK OF USING A DIFFERENT ZONING? AND SO THAT'S WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO, TO ME. THAT IT'S AN UNNECESSARY RISK THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO TAKE AND WE STILL GET AN EXCELLENT BUILDING. WE GET THE DENSITY WITHOUT IT.
01:50:12.150: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU. COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
01:50:14.219: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MAYOR PRO TEM. I WOULD APPRECIATED A POSTPONEMENT. I THINK THERE COULD HAVE BEEN SOME MORE ROOM FOR NEGOTIATION ON THE CONDITIONS, BUT I THINK, YOU KNOW, HAVING TO TAKE MY VOTE TONIGHT, I'M A YES. THIS IS, YOU KNOW, A TEN-MINUTE WALK FROM THE KELLOGG EYE CENTER, SEVEN MINUTE WALK FROM THE NURSING SCHOOL, 15-MINUTE WALK TO THE HOSPITAL, AND TO THE MEDICAL SCHOOL. AND THEN I ACTUALLY REALLY APPRECIATED COUNCIL MEMBER HAYNER'S KIND OF FRAME OF WHAT IS THE NEED? A LOT OF THINGS, IF YOU HAVE LISTENED TO ME OVER THE YEARS, WHEN TALKING ABOUT LAND USE, THE NEED COMES TO OUR HOUSING MARKET. AND AS YOU LOOK OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS, AT THE ANN ARBOR AREA, THE AVERAGE HOME PRICE HAS GONE FROM ABOUT 200 PLUS THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR, BETWEEN 100, $210,000 A YEAR, UP TO AROUND 380 -- I'M SORRY, NOT A YEAR. JUST $200,000 A YEAR. NOPE. I DID IT AGAIN. $200,000, PERIOD. TO ABOUT $380,000. THAT'S AN INCREASE OF ABOUT 90%. THAT'S ALMOST DOUBLE THE COST OF HOUSING TO PURCHASE A MOMENT HERE IN ANN ARBOR AREA. THAT'S A STAGGERING CHANGE OVER THE COURSE OF NINE OR TEN YEARS. AND I THINK THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND ARGUMENT, YOU KNOW, IS A LITTLE TOO SIMPLISTIC, BUT I THINK IT'S A BIG PART OF THE PUZZLE. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT TEN FOR SALE UNITS THIS CLOSE TO THE HOSPITAL AND THE PRICE RANGE WE ARE LOOKING AT, WE ARE REALLY TALKING ABOUT THESE ARE LIKELY GOING TO BE DOCTORS WHO ARE LIVING HERE. AND WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE DOCTORS' SALARY AND CREATING NEW HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEM, I WOULD RATHER THAT THAN DOCTORS BE -- YOU KNOW, NEW DOCTORS, PEOPLE MOVING TO THIS COMMUNITY, LOOKING AT OUR EXISTING HOUSING STOCK IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS WE HAVE NOW BECAUSE THAT IS GOING TO -- THEY ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO BUY IN CASH. THEY WILL BE ABLE TO BUY QUICKLY. THEY WILL BE ABLE TO BUY OVER THE ASKING AND I WOULD RATHER CREATE NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR NEW AFFLUENT PEOPLE MOVING INTO THIS COMMUNITY, BUT -- INSTEAD OF HAVING THEM COMPETE WITH PEOPLE WHO MAKE LESS THAN THEM IN OUR OUTLYING NEIGHBORHOODS AND THAT'S WHERE I SEE THE NEED, IS AT EVERY INCOME LEVEL, WE'RE INCREASING THE NUMBER OF JOBS IN THIS COMMUNITY. WE JUST ARE. WE ARE A COMMUNITY THAT HAS MORE JOBS THAN PEOPLE. AND THE UNIVERSITY'S HOSPITAL, WHERE THIS IS, YOU KNOW, LOCATED, INCREDIBLY CLOSE PROXIMITY IS INCREASING THEIR EMPLOYMENT RAPIDLY, TO THE UNIT OF TENS OF THOUSANDS. AND -- OR OVER 10,000. AND THAT'S REAL. AND THE NEW PEOPLE THAT THEY EMPLOY ARE GOING TO BE HIGHLY PAID AND THEY WILL BE COMPETING TO BUY THE HOUSES IN -- IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS THAT WE REPRESENT. AND THAT'S A SCARY NOTION. AND I WOULD RATHER CREATE NEW OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM. I THINK TOO THE NEED IS CLEANING THIS UP. UNFORTUNATELY, WE LIVE IN A STATE AND A TIME WHERE THE BEST WAY TO CLEAN UP CONTAMINATION IS OFTEN -- WELL, ONE, IT REQUIRES USUALLY THE BUILDING THAT EXISTS TO BE TORN DOWN. AND IT USUALLY REQUIRES A PRIVATE DEVELOPER TO HAVE SOME INCENTIVE, IN THIS CASE, IT'S THE INCENTIVE TO HAVE RESIDENTIAL -- RESIDENTIAL USE, INSTEAD OF A COMMERCIAL OR A MANUFACTURING USE. AND THAT INCENTIVE MEANS THAT PRIVATE DOLLARS ARE GOING TO BE USED TO CLEAN UP SOMETHING THAT'S GOING INTO OUR PUBLIC WATERWAYS. AND I THINK THAT'S A REALLY GOOD AND IMPORTANT THING, BECAUSE THE SITUATION RIGHT NOW IS THAT RAIN WATER IS HITTING THE GROUND AND PUSHING IT INTO OUR SEWER SYSTEM, OUR STORMWATER SYSTEM, PUSHING IT INTO AND OUT OF THE PROPERTY AND INTO NEIGHBOR'S PROPERTIES AND THAT'S A REALLY -- THAT'S A REALLY SERIOUS AND BIG RISK THAT WE'RE -- WE WOULD BE DELAYING. SO FOR THOSE TWO PRIMARY REASONS, THE EFFECT ON THE HOUSING MARKET, EVEN IF JUST TEN UNITS, THAT'S TEN HOUSES IN NEIGHBORHOODS, THAT -- THAT WON'T BE AFFECTED OR COMPETED AGAINST. AND THE FACT THAT WE HAVE REAL CLEANUP OPPORTUNITY USING PRIVATE DOLLARS.
01:54:33.778: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU. COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
01:54:35.914: >> Councilmember Grand: I ALSO WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS, UNLESS I THINK WE MAY NEED TO BRING IT BACK FOR RECONSIDERATION, AND THEN I MAY BE VOTING NO TO DO IT. IF I VOTE NO, IT'S FOR THAT REASON AND THAT REASON ONLY. WE HAVE BEEN HEARING A LOT ABOUT, YOU KNOW, WOULD THIS SET PRECEDENT? I HOPE SO! BECAUSE IT'S A GREAT DEVELOPMENT CLOSE TO DOWNTOWN, AND IT'S THE EXACT KIND OF INFILL THAT WE WANT TO BE SEEING. WE HAVE HEARD A LOT AT THIS TABLE ABOUT, YOU KNOW, WE LIKE THIS -- WE LIKE THIS BUILDING. IT'S ATTRACTIVE. IT'S PROVIDING HOUSING. THERE'S ENVIRONMENTAL CLEANUP, WHICH IS SUBSTANTIAL. SO THE ONLY WAY WE GET THINGS CLEANED UP IS T IS TYPICALLY TO REDEVELOP AND I DON'T SEE THAT AS UNFORTUNATE IF IT'S MEETING A COMMUNITY NEED IN A WAY THAT THE NEIGHBORS ARE EXCITED ABOUT AND BENEFITS OUR COMMUNITY OVERALL, BY PROVIDING HOUSING. I THINK WE ALSO NEED TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THIS REZONING IS ACTUALLY ASKING. IT'S NOT ASKING TO GO FROM R1A OR R1B TO C1A. IT'S ASKING TO GO FROM C1B, WHICH IS COMMUNITY CONVENIENCE CENTER. AND I WOULD LIKE TO ACTUALLY READ THE DEFINITION OF WHAT THAT IS, BECAUSE TO ME, THIS DOESN'T LOOK LIKE AN UP ZONE. IT LOOKS MAYBE IN SOME CASES FROM A TRAFFIC STANDPOINT, CERTAINLY A DOWN ZONE AND, YOU KNOW SO MAYBE YOU COULD CALL IT A LATERAL ZONE, BUT CERTAINLY NOT AN UP ZONE. C1B SAYS THAT THIS DISTRICT IS INTENDED PRIMARILY TO SERVE THE NEEDS THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY. THIS INCLUDES ESTABLISHMENTS THAT ALTHOUGH THEY PRIMARILY SERVICE SURROUNDING NEIGHBORHOOD, COULD ALSO SERVE A LARGER TRADE OR SERVICE AREA. THESE DISTRICTS TEN TO CREATE GREATER ENVIRONMENTAL STRESSES THAN THOSE USES PERMITTED UNDER C1. SO THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE AN UP ZONE TO ME. EVEN THOUGH GOODS OR SERVICES OFFERED MIGHT BE IN THE CONVENIENCEORY OR CLASSIFICATION. MOST PEP E PEOPLE ENTERING THIS DISTRICT WILL COME BY AUTOMOBILE AND PARK ONCE. THE MERCHANDISING ACTIVITIES IN THIS DISTRICT BEPENDS ON MODERATE DEVELOPMENT AND COMPARISON SHOPPING. OFFICE BUILDINGS ARE COMPATIBLE WITH THE PURPOSE OF THE DISTRICT, AS LONG AS ADEQUATE PARKING CAN BE PROVIDED FOR THE OFFICE AND THE RETAIL MERCHANDISING ACTIVITY. SO WHEN I THINK ABOUT WHAT THIS IS ZONED FOR, THIS IS Z ZONED FR HIGH AUTO USE, FREQUENT STOPS, OR OFFICE. SO TO TURN THIS INTO TEN UNITS OF HOUSING, THAT ENCOURAGES BIKING AND WALKING, AND LOCAL SHOPPING, TO ME IS NOT AN UP ZONE. I THINK IT'S AN APPROPRIATE USE AND THEN WHEN YOU PAIR THAT WITH THE NUMBER OF CONDITIONS, THAT MEANS THAT THIS CAN NEVER BE -- THAT'S WHAT CONDITIONAL ZONING IS. THAT MEANS YOU CAN'T TURN THIS INTO A SKYSCRAPER. YOU CAN'T CHANGE IT. THERE ARE MANY STEPS THAT NEED TO BE TAKEN TO PROVIDE THESE DIFFERENCES. IT'S THE DEVELOPER OFFERING RESTRICTIONS ON THE ZONING AND THE BUILDING. SO IT'S NOT -- TO ME, THIS IDEA AND I AGREE WITH COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI ON THIS ONE, THIS ISN'T -- THIS ISN'T SETTING PRECEDENT. IT'S JUST TRYING TO PROVIDE AN ATTRACTIVE INFILL DEVELOPMENT THAT MEETS THE NEEDS OF OUR COMMUNITY, CLEANS THINGS UP, AND ENCOURAGES NON-MOTORIZED MOBILITY.
01:58:06.924: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU. COUNCILMEMBER SMITH.
01:58:09.327: >> Councilmember Smith: MAYBE I CAN PUT A BOOK END ON THIS. I DON'T THINK I WILL TALK AT LENGTH, BECAUSE COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI TALKED ABOUT -- COVERED MY FEELINGS PRETTY ACCURATELY AND I DON'T THINK THAT I CAN IMPROVE ON WHAT HE SAID. I THINK, YOU KNOW, I WOULD JUST REITERATE ISS ZONING CHANGE HELPS TO ACCOMPLISH A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT WE SAY WE ARE FOR. AT SOME POINT WE HAVE TO START SAYING YES TO THEM, OTHERWISE THOSE ARE HOLLOW PROMISES AND NOT GENUINE DOCUMENTS THAT WE HAVE CREATED IN OUR CLIMATE ACTION PLAN AND OUR SUSTAINABILITY FRAMEWORK, YOU KNOW IN OUR COMMITMENTS TO DIFFERENT THINGS. SO I AM -- I AM SUPPORTING THIS, AND I HAVE NO RESERVATIONS ABOUT DOING SO.
01:59:00.111: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU. COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
01:59:02.714: >> Councilmember Griswold: JUST SO THERE'S NO CONFUSION, I AM FOR DENSITY. I AM FOR THIS BUILDING. I AM NOT FOR REZONING TO C1A. I BELIEVE IT'S A RISK THAT WE DON'T NEED TO TAKE BECAUSE THIS QUALIFIES FOR A PUD. THANK YOU.
01:59:21.666: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:59:27.739: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU FOR THE SECOND TIME TO SPEAK. THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF CALLS TO HAVE THIS COME BACK AS A PUD, AS IF THAT IS THE ANSWER TO EVERYTHING. IT'S NOT. AND, YOU KNOW, IT HAS A LOT OF DOWN SITE FOR THE PETITIONER. THE DEMANDS CAN BE ONGOING. IT -- IT REALLY HAS A HARD TIME FOR THE PETITIONER TO WRAP IT AROUND AND KNOW WHAT THEIR ABSOLUTE COSTS ARE GOING TO BE AND RISK. WE SAW IT YESTERDAY AT CAUCUS WHEN PETITIONER FOR THE GLENN HAD TO COME BACK AND GO THROUGH THE WHOLE PROCESS FOR FIVE SMALL MINOR CHANGES THATROVED THE PROJECT. BUT YET THEY HAD TO COME BACK THROUGH THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN BECAUSE IT WAS DONE UNDER A PUD. SO WE MAKE IT SOUND LIKE A PUD IS A GREAT TOOL. IT IS FOR A GREAT COMPLEX DEVELOPMENTS LIKE THE MISC HCON SITE BUT TO ASK SOMEONE WHO IS BUILDING JUST TEN UNITS TO GO THROUGH ALL OF THAT. WE TALK ABOUT COSTS, THE COSTS WILL KEEP GOING UP, IF WE KEEP PUTTING MORE RED TAPE AROUND GET THINGS DONE. I URGE MY COLLEAGUES HERE AT THIS TABLE THAT EVENTUALLY YOU WILL HAVE TO SAY YES AND YOU WON'T FIND THE PERFECT DEVELOPMENT EVERY SINGLE TIME. SO, YOU KNOW, I WANT TO SAY THAT A PUD IS NOT THE ANSWER FOR ALL TYPES OF DEVELOPMENT.
02:01:20.284: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI. I WILL JUST OFFER THAT I DO RECOGNIZE THAT DEVELOPERS DO NOT LIKE PUDs, PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF THE NEGOTIATION ASPECT OF IT. AND I SERVED PREVIOUSLY ON CITY COUNCIL, WE DID A LOT OF PUDs AND THEN FOR WHATEVER REASON, THEY JUST WEREN'T UTILIZED THE WAY THEY WERE IN PRIOR YEARS. ONE BENEFIT I SAW FROM PUDs IS THAT THROUGHOUT THAT PERIOD, WE WERE ROUTINELY DONATING THROUGH THIS NEGOTIATION PROCESS THAT COMES FROM A PUD PROCESS, OR IS PART OF IT. WE WERE DONATING TO THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING TRUST FUND. PUDs WENT AWAY AND WE SAW THOSE DONATIONS, THOSE CONTRIBUTIONS DISAPPEAR. FOR ME, AS I INDICATED A MOMENT AGO, I WON'T BE SUPPORTING THIS REZONING TONIGHT. THERE'S REALLY A LOT WRONG WITH THIS IN MY VIEW OF REZONING, NOT THE SITE PLAN AS PROPOSED. THERE'S NOTHING SCARY ABOUT THE SITE PLAN. THE OBJECTIONS ARE ZONING SPECIFIC, NOT SITE PLAN SPECIFIC, AND FOR ME, IF YOU BROUGHT BACK THE EXACT SAME SITE PLAN AND DIDN'T CHANGE A THING, YOU WOULD BE GOOD TO GO. IT'S THE ZONING. I -- I AGREE WITH THE RESIDENTS WE HAVE HEARD FROM, WHO SAID APPROVING THIS RE REZONING TO AA IS THE PROBLEM. THE CITY IS EVOLVING, FOCUSED NOT ON BEST FIT BUT ON PERMITTED USES, WHICH ALLOWS DEVELOPERS TO MAXIMIZE DENSITY AND OPTIMIZE THEIR PROJECT WITHOUT CONSIDERATION OF THE MASTER PLAN, LAND USE RECOMMENDATIONS, THE SURROUNDING USES, OR THE OTHER BENEFITS THAT WOULD ACCRUE TO THE CITY WITH MORE APPROPRIATE ZONING. THIS REZONING REQUEST TO C1A IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE. AS I MENTIONED C1A CAMPUS BUSINESS DISTRICT, IS ZONING INTENDED FOR SUPPORTING BUSINESSES IN A CAMPUS LOCATION. AND THIS PROPOSAL IS NEITHER. IT'S A 100% RESIDENTIAL PROJECT AND NOT NEAR CENTRAL CAMPUS. IMPORTANTLY, IT'S NOT CONSISTENT WITH MASTER PLAN. C1A IS NOT APPROPRIATE AND CERTAINLY NOT THE BEST FIT. HOWEVER, SINCE THIS OBSCURE, NOT WELL-DEFINED BUSINESS CLASSIFICATION IS NOW PROMINENTLY ON THE MENU AND AVAILABLE TO DEVELOPERS, THANKED TO THE ILL-ADVISED OF BROADWAY LOWER TOWN AND SINCE IT'S EVOLVED TO PERMIT ANY USE ONE COULD REQUIRE, WITHOUT THE ACCOMPANYING BENEFITS LIKE AFFORDABLE HOUSING, IT'S NOT AT ALL SURPRISING TO ME THAT DEVELOPERS ARE PROPOSING IT. I WAS STRUCK BY THE RESPONSE TO ONE OF MY QUESTIONS AND I THINK -- SORRY, IT REALLY DEMONSTRATES WHAT A AS FAR AS F. IS THE QUESTION WAS ABOUT PUD OR RESIDENTIAL ZONING RATHER THAN C1A AND IT STATED, QUOTE, RESIDENTIAL ZONING WOULD BE CHALLENGING BECAUSE OF THE MASTER PLAN COMMERCIAL DESIGNATION, END QUOTE. SO HOW DO WE GET AROUND THAT CHALLENGE? SIMPLE, WE GIVE A 100% RESIDENTIAL PROJECT A COMMERCIAL ZONING. I'M SORRY, BUT THAT'S JUST NOT HOW WE SHOULD BE DOING THINGS, AND IT'S TO THE CONSISTENT WITH MASTER PLAN. AS ONE OF THE EMAILS WE RECEIVED NOTED APPROVING THIS REZONING TO C1A CREATES A HUGE LOOPHOLE IN OUR ZONING. I AGREE WITH THAT SENTIMENT. ALTHOUGH STAFF AND OUR ATTORNEY'S OFFICE SUGGEST THERE'S NO PRECEDENT-SETTING ASPECT TO THIS, IT'S THE SAME THING THAT WAS SAID WITH LOWER TOWN. I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE PRECEDENT. IF WE SUPPORT THIS INAPPROPRIATE REZONING, I'M CONFIDENT THAT WILL LEAD TO ■MOREDEVELOPERS, TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITY, THE LOOPHOLE AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THAT'S IN THE CITY BEST LONG-TERM INTEREST. SO I WILL BE VOTING NO ON THE REZONING AND THANK YOU FOR LISTENING. ANY OTHER COUNCILMEMBERS? COUNCILMEMBER EATON?
02:05:26.363: >> Councilmember Eaton: I APPRECIATE YOUR EXPLANATION OF YOUR POSITION. I WOULD POINT OUT THAT AFTER COUNCIL APPROVES C1AR ZONING FOR THE LOWER TOWN PROJECT, ROXBURY CAME FORWARD AND PROPOSED USING THAT SAME ZONING CLASSIFICATION FOR THE DTE PROPERTY. IF WE APPROVE C1A, FOR THIS PROPERTY, WE CAN EXPECT THAT OTHER DEVELOPERS WILL SEEK THIS ZONING CLASSIFICATION FOR PRETTY MUCH ANY DEVELOPMENT THAT'S WITHIN A HALF MILE OF A UNIVERSITY BUILDING. THIS IS A ZONING CLASSIFICATION THAT HAS RARELY BEEN USED IN THE LAST FEW DECADES. IT CLUSTERED AROUND SOUTH STATE STREET AND SOUTH UNIVERSITY AND AREAS LIKE THAT AT THE CORE OF THE CITY, WHICH HAVE BEEN REPLACED BY D1 AND D2 ZONING. IT REALLY PROBABLY DOESN'T HAVE A PLACE IN OUR SCHEME OF ZONING. IF THIS IS THE KIND OF PROJECT WE WANT TO BUILD, THEN WE SHOULD DEVELOP A ZONING DISTRICT THAT IS SUITABLE FOR TEN APARTMENTS ON A SMALL LOT IN A MIXED USE NEIGHBORHOOD. THIS CAMPUS AREA DESIGNATION IS INAPPROPRIATE FOR THIS SITE, EVEN THOUGH THE BUILDING THAT IS BEING PROPOSED IS NOT OFFENSIVE TO MOST OF US ON COUNCIL. SO I WILL BE VOTING AGAINST THIS REZONING.
02:07:00.791: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER EATON. COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
02:07:04.595: >> Councilmember Bannister:  I WAS WONDERING IF IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO ASK STAFF TO -- TO BUILD ON WHAT COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI SAID, OH, IT WILL BE DIFFICULT FOR THE PETITIONER TO GO BACK AND GET A DIFFERENT ZONING. I'M WONDERING HOW QUICKLY -- IF MR. LENART WOULD ILLUMINATE US ON HOW QUICKLY THIS EXISTING SITE PLAN COULD BE TURNED AROUND UNDER A DIFFERENT ZONING SUCH AS A PUD.
02:07:39.129: >> I -- I GUESS I WILL ANSWER IT AND ASK IF THE ATTORNEY McDONALD CAN MAKE SURE THAT I'M NOT MISTAKING, BUT I THINK THAT THE CITY COUNCIL DOES HAVE AUTHORITY TO MAKE MODIFICATIONS TO A ZONING REQUEST. THERE WOULD BE PROBABLY POTENTIALLY SOME PROCEDURAL IMPACTS TO HOW THAT WOULD APPEAR ON YOUR AGENDA IF IT'S SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT THE CURRENT IS. BUT I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WERE CONSIDERING A REQUEST FROM THE PETITIONER OR INITIATING ANOTHER ZONING IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS POSITION THAT WOULD NECESSARILY HAVE TO START OVER AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PROCESS.
02:08:18.869: >> Councilmember Lumm: CITY ATTORNEY McDONALD?
02:08:20.537: >> I THINK THAT'S GENERALLY CORRECT. THE -- BECAUSE THIS IS A ZONING REQUEST ON THE PART OF THE COUNCIL, THE COUNCIL COULD COME UP WITH A DIFFERENT ZONING IF IT FOUND THAT APPROPRIATE. IF YOU -- AS YOU GO FORWARD, THOUGH, ONCE YOU VOTE ON THE -- IF YOU WERE TO VOTE DOWN THIS REQUEST TODAY, THAT WOULD END THE PROCESS FOR THIS PARTICULAR ZONING AND THE PETITIONER WOULD HAVE TO START FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE PROCESS. I THINK WHAT -- IF I'M -- IF I UNDERSTAND MR. LENART'S COMMENTS CORRECTLY, I THINK WHAT HE WAS REFERRING TO WAS THE FACT THAT IF SOME OTHER ZONING WAS TO COME FORWARD, THAT, OF COURSE, WOULD REQUIRE ADDITIONAL READINGS OF THE ZONING AND YOU WOULDN'T BE VOTING ON THAT TONIGHT. IT WOULD COME -- IT WOULD TAKE AT A FUTURE MEETING AFTER AN ADDITIONAL FIRST READING.
02:09:16.627: >> Councilmember Lumm: COUNCILM.
02:09:17.528: >> Councilmember Eaton: CAN I ASK A FOLLOW-UP QUESTION? CAN WE VOTE THIS ZONING APPLICATION DOWN AND POSTPONE THE SITE PLAN, AND ASK THAT THEY COME FORWARD WITH A DIFFERENT ZONING PROPOSAL? AND COME DIRECTLY TO US RATHER THAN GOING TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION?
02:09:35.746: >> NO. ONCE YOU -- ONCE YOU VOTE IT DOWN, THAT ENDS THE PROCESS, AND ANY SUBSEQUENT RECOMMENDATION WOULD HAVE TO COME THROUGH THE PLANNING COMMISSION FOLLOWING STATE LAW.
02:09:49.860: >> Councilmember Lumm: COUNCILM.
02:09:50.728: >> Councilmember Nelson:  SO IF VOTING IT DOWN ENDS THE PROCESS, JUST FULL STOP, YOU ARE SAYING THAT WE WOULD BE EMPOWERED AT THIS TABLE TO AMEND THE ZONING? IS THAT WHAT YOU SAID?
02:10:04.575: >> WELL, THERE IS A PETITION IN FRONT OF YOU AND COUNCIL HAS A DECISION TO PUT ZONING ON THE PROPERTY. YOU CERTAINLY COULD DO SO, IF YOU WANTED TO SUGGEST A -- AND I THINK THE COUNCIL MAY BE -- IF I RECALL, THIS MAY HAVE BEEN DONE ONCE OR TWICE IN THE LAST TEN OR 15 YEARS WHERE SOMEONE FOR SOME REASON SUGGESTS AIL SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT OR ASKS STAFF FOR OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE ZONING. THERE'S NO REQUIREMENTS FOR COUNCIL TO CHANGE THE ZONING AT ALL, BUT THERE'S A STATE REQUIRED PROCESS SO THAT IF THERE'S A ZONING RECOMMENDATION THAT COMES FORWARD TO THE COUNCIL, YOU CAN -- YOU KNOW, YOU CAN APPROVE IT, DENY IT, MODIFY IT. ONCE IT'S VOTED DOWN, THEN IT WOULD REQUIRE A NEW PETITION THAT WOULD HAVE TO GO TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION AND THEN COME BACK TO THIS BODY FOR FINAL DECISION MAKING.
02:11:00.064: >> Councilmember Nelson:  SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS PIGGYBACKING ON WHAT COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER SAID IS THE HURDLES OF A PUD. WHAT I'M ASKING IS COULD SOMEONE ON THE FLY AT THIS TABLE SAY I'M AMENDING IT TO MAKE IT A PUD AND IT DOESN'T HAVE TO REVISIT THE PLANNING COMMISSION? THE PROCESS COULD MOVE FORWARD, JUST STRICTLY FROM THIS TABLE?
02:11:21.752: >> I THINK THE ISSUE WITH THE PUD IS IT'S SITE SPECIFIC AND IT REQUIRES SUPPLEMENTAL REGIMENT. THERE'S NO WAY TO DO THAT TONIGHT. THE STARTS THAT ARE BUILT IN THE ORDINANCE WOULD HAVE TO BE MET HASN'T THAT INCLUDES SORT OF REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE SORT OF WRITTEN FOR THE SITE THAT ARE RESPONSIVE TO THE STANDARD. SO NO ONE COULD DO THAT TODAY. CERTAINLY THERE'S SOME DISCUSSION OR THE MATTER COULD BE POSTPONED TO ENTERTAIN THAT, BUT CERTAINLY ANY -- ANY PUD -- WELL, REGARDLESS, I WILL JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT, BECAUSE I THINK THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION.
02:12:10.200: >> Councilmember Lumm: COUNCILMR MR. McDONALD.
02:12:12.803: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES TO FOLLOW UP ON COUNCILMEMBER NELSON'S QUESTION. I GUESS PORALLY, THERE'S BEEN A MOTION TO  POSTPONE. CAN WE MAKE ANOTHER MOTION TO POSTPONE. IT SOUNDS LIKE WE ARE WORKING TOWARDS SOMETHING THAT WOULD BECOME MORE PALATABLE TO PEOPLE AND GIVE THE DEVELOPER THE OPTION TO WORK WITH THOSE TERMS OR NOT. CAN WE DO A MOTION TO POSTPONE. DID --
02:12:50.073: >> I THINK THE RULES REQUIRE YOU TO NOT TABLE ITEMS BUT POSTPONE THEM TO SPECIFIC DATES, BUT I THINK -- OR SPECIFIC THINGS TO BE MET. I THINK A MOTION TO TABLE -- YOU HAD ONE MOTION TO TABLE, AND IF THE -- NO, A MOTION TO POSTPONE. I THINK SOMEBODY COULD MAKE ANOTHER MOTION TO POSTPONE AN ITEM, AS I THINK THAT CAN BE DONE AT ANY TIME.
02:13:15.899: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  SO IN THAT CASE, I WOULD MOVE TO POSTPONE THIS TO ALLOW STAFF AND THE DEVELOPER TO DISCUSS THE FEASIBILITY OF A PUD ZONING.
02:13:27.878: >> Councilmember Eaton: CAN WE ASK THE DEVELOPER IF THEY ARE WILLING TO ENTERTAIN OUR IDEA OF --
02:13:34.017: >> Councilmember Lumm: COUNCILM.
02:13:35.452: >> Councilmember Eaton: I MEAN YOU MADE A MOTION AND I REALLY NEED YOUR PERMISSION TO GO FORWARD.
02:13:38.789: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES, PLEASE BY ALL MEANS.
02:13:41.258: >> Councilmember Lumm: YOU NEED TO HEAR THAT THERE ARE NO OBJECTIONS FROM COUNCIL TO CALL UP ON MR. MOORE AND I'M HEARING NO OBJECTIONS. SO MR. MOORE.
02:13:51.168: >> WE WOULD CERTAINLY ENTERTAIN POSTPONEMENT OR TABLING TO ENGAGE WITH ADDITIONAL DISCUSSIONS WITH STAFF.
02:13:56.306: >> Councilmember Eaton: ON THE ISSUE OF FINDING A DIFFERENT ZONING CLASSIFICATION.
02:13:59.710: >> IF IT'S POSSIBLE TO DO SO, WITHOUT HAVING TO GO BACK THROUGH ALL THE HOOPS AGAIN.
02:14:04.781: >> Councilmember Lumm: OKAY.
02:14:05.415: >> Councilmember Eaton: AND AS LONG AS YOU ARE THERE, HOW MUCH TIME WOULD YOU LIKE THAT POSTPONEMENT TO BE TO DO THAT TASK?
02:14:17.227: >> YEAH, YOU KNOW, WE HAD REQUESTED POSTPONEMENT TO THE SECOND READING IN SEPTEMBER. I DON'T KNOW, BRETT, HOW LONG DO YOU THINK THE STAFF WOULD HAVE TO BE ENGAGED IN THAT PROCESS. DO YOU THINK IT'S DOABLE BY THE SECOND MEETING IN SEPTEMBER. I'M NOT SURE HOW BUSY STAFF IS.
02:14:41.084: >> YEAH, I BELIEVE WE COULD ACCOMMODATE THAT, IF WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT TECHNICAL REVIEW CHANGES TO THE ACTUAL PHYSICAL LAYOUT. WE ARE REALLY TALKING ABOUT THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK IN WHICH THAT SITE PLAN HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE CONSIDERED. I THINK WE COULD WORK TO GET THAT BACK TO THAT SAME TIME FRAME.
02:14:58.635: >> Councilmember Lumm: OKAY. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS?
02:15:00.937: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  SO THE MOTION WOULD BE SPECIFICALLY TO THE SECOND MEETING IN SEPTEMBER.
02:15:04.374: >> Councilmember Lumm: RIGHT. COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD TO THE MOTION?
02:15:08.145: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES, JUST FOR CLARIFICATION. SO THE MOTION IS TO POSTPONE TO EXPLORE OTHER ZONING --
02:15:16.953: >> Councilmember Lumm: WAIT. I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT. WE NEED A SECOND.
02:15:19.056: >> Councilmember Eaton: I WOULD SECOND IT.
02:15:20.524: >> Councilmember Lumm: SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER EATON. CONTINUE, COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD. I'M SORRY.
02:15:25.962: >> Councilmember Griswold: IT'S TO EXPLORE OTHER ZONING,
02:15:33.804: >> Councilmember Lumm: MR. LENAR T IS NODDING YES IN AGREEMENT.
02:15:40.877: >> Councilmember Griswold: OKAY.
02:15:42.346: >> Councilmember Lumm: ANY OTHER DISCUSSION TO THIS MOTION, WHICH IS -- COUNCILMEMBER SMITH.
02:15:47.851: >> Councilmember Smith: ON THE -- TALKING ABOUT PUD, MR. McDONALD, YOU KNOW, LOOKING AT THE PUD PROCESS, IF THAT ENDS UP BEING THE AVENUE KIND OF TAKEN OR RECOMMENDED, IS THERE ANY WAY TO KIND OF SIDE STEP ANY OF THE FIVE, YOU KNOW, REQUIRED CONSECUTIVE STEPS IN THE PUD PROCESS?
02:16:11.007: >> WELL, I THINK THAT'S WHAT I -- I WANTED TO MAKE SURE TO BRING THAT UP.
02:16:14.811: >> Councilmember Lumm: CAN YOU PLEASE FIRST ENUMERATE THE FIVE STEPS FOR EVERYONE.
02:16:23.353: >> Councilmember Smith: I'M JUST READING FROM THE U.D.C., THE -- AND THIS IS -- THIS IS ON PAGE 5.29.1 ON PAGE 198. PUD PROCESS INVOLVES FIVE CONSECOND TESTIFY STEPS CITIZEN PARTICIPATION, PREAPPLICATION CONFERENCE WITH STAFF, PREPETITION CONFERENCE WITH PLANNING COMMISSION, PUD ZONING DISTRICT REVIEW, AND PUD SITE PLAN REVIEW, THE PREAPPLICATION REVIEW IS BEFORE THEY SUBMIT A PLANNING AND IT OCCURS AFTER THE APPLICANT HAS SUBMITTED A FORMAL APPLICATION. THE PUD SITE PLAN WOULD BE MADE FOR ONLY IF THE PUD ZONING DISTRICT HAS BEEN APPROVED AND -- AND AS REQUIRED BY THE SECTION OR THE PLANNING COMMISSION IS APPROVED AND THE POLITIC'S REQUEST FOR PUD ZONING DISTRICT, PUD SITE PLAN APPROVALS TO BE PRESENTED TOGETHER AT THE SAME MEETING PER SECTION 5.2.9.
02:17:22.612: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER SMITH. I SEE TWO STAFF WHO ARE PRIME TO RESPOND. I DON'T KNOW WHO WANTS TO TAKE IT FIRST, MR. McDOWEL, MR. LENART?
02:17:35.325: >> I THINK THE MOTION THAT STANDS ON THE TABLE WHICH ASKS THE STAFF TO LOOK AT OTHER ZONING, INCLUDING PUDs, YOU KNOW, CERTAINLY WOULD BE FINE. [ NO AUDIO ] WOULD BE NECESSARY, REGARDLESS OF THE PROCEDURES THAT WERE READ, WE WOULD WENT TO JUST VERY CAREFULLY LOOK AT THAT, AS WELL AS STATE LAW SO THAT WE COULD GIVE -- EVEN IF THE PETITIONER WANTED IT, I DIDN'T WANT THE EXPECTATION OF THE BODY TO BE THAT IT COULD COME BACK AT THE NEXT MEETING AS A PUD. IT MAY REQUIRE SOME MORE PROCESS, AND SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WAS CLEAR SO THAT THERE WAS CLEAR EXPECTATIONS OF WHAT IS HAPPENING.
02:18:22.005: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU. THAT'S HELPFUL CLARIFICATION. AND MR. LENART.
02:18:25.075: >> I WANTED TO ECHO THAT BUT FROM A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT ANGLE. I WAS NODDING, THE MOTION AS PROVIDED ALLOWS US SOME FLEXIBILITY TO LOOK AT WHAT I'M HEARING THE COUNCIL IS SEEKING TO POTENTIALLY ACCOMPLISH. WE MIGHT VERY WELL BE ABLE TO LOOK AT WAYS TO INCORPORATE SOME OF THE DESIRES THAT I'M HEARING THAT A PUD WOULD TYPICALLY AFFORD BUT POTENTIALLY THROUGH THE CURRENT STRUCTURE OF A CONDITIONAL ZONING. SO JUST TO ECHO ATTORNEY McDONALD'S COMMENTS, I THINK THAT GIVEN US THE OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT THAT, WE WILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO BOTH LOOK AT THE PUD PROCESS AND OTHER AVENUES POTENTIALLY TO GET TO A VERY SIMILAR RESULT.
02:19:03.413: >> Councilmember Lumm: OKAY. COUNCILMEMBER GRAND?
02:19:07.150: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. SO THIS COULD -- OTHER ZONING COULD POTENTIALLY BE AN R4 SOMETHING OR OTHER?
02:19:13.623: >> AS INDICATED IN MY AGENDA QUESTIONS, I THINK THAT THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE MORE DIFFICULT TO MEET THE INTENTIONS OF THE MASTER PLAN, WHILE THIS IS A RESIDENTIAL PROJECT, A COMMERCIAL ZONING DISTRICT IS MORE CONSISTENT WITH THE MASTER PLAN RECOMMENDATIONS OF A COMMERCIAL OFFICE DESIGNATION.
02:19:31.141: >> Councilmember Grand: OKAY, BUT GIVEN THE MIXED USES IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD?
02:19:36.546: >> AGAIN, I THINK THAT MOTION GIVES US SOME BROAD ABILITIES TO LOOK AT. AND JUST TO CONFIRM WHAT I'M HEARING, I'M GENERALLY HEARING SUPPORT FOR THE PHYSICAL REPRESENTATION OF THIS DEVELOPMENT, BUT PERHAPS A MORE RESTRICTIVE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S NOT UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AFTER THE REZONING.
02:20:06.142: >> Councilmember Grand: THERE COULD BE AN R4 AND NOT A PUD?
02:20:09.145: >> THAT GIVES US OPTIONS TO COME BACK WITH THE CODE AND THE PETITIONER.
02:20:16.119: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU.
02:20:19.089: >> Councilmember Lumm: COUNCILME R BANNISTER.
02:20:20.123: >> Councilmember Bannister: ONE OTHER OPTION WOULD BE IF THE PETITIONER WOULD WITHDRAW THEIR REQUEST, THE REZONING REQUEST TONIGHT, AND BRING IT BACK, WOULD THAT EXPEDITE THINGS ANY MORE THAN THIS AVENUE WE'RE HEADING DOWN?
02:20:33.370: >> NO, I DON'T BELIEVE THE PETITIONER HAS THE ABILITY TO WITHDRAW. IT'S BEEN SUBMITTED TO THE COUNCIL. IT'S IN FRONT OF THE COUNCIL FOR THE COUNCIL'S DECISION. AND SO REALLY, YOU HAVE TO TAKE ACTION, AND THAT ACTION HAS TO BE PROACTIVE, MEANING APPROVAL, DENIAL, POSTPONEMENT. IF THEY -- YOU KNOW, THEY CERTAINLY CAN AGREE TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT PROCESS, BUT IT'S REALLY UP TO THE COUNCIL TO MAKE THAT DECISION.
02:20:55.625: >> Councilmember Bannister: AND WHEN WAS THE DEADLINE FOR THEM -- JUST FOR FUTURE REFERENCE, FOR A PETITIONER TO WITHDRAW SOMETHING?
02:21:05.468: >> TO WITHDRAW? THEY CERTAINLY -- BEFORE THIS WAS PLACED ON THE COUNCIL AGENDA, COULD HAVE ASKED STAFF TO POSTPONE THE MATTER AND NOT PLACE IT ON THE AGENDA. I THINK STAFF WOULD HAVE FOLLOWED THAT REQUEST, BUT ESSENTIALLY WHEN SOMETHING HAS BEEN PLACED IN FRONT OF THE COUNCIL AND ESPECIALLY WHEN WE HAVE ADVERTISED PUBLIC HEARINGS, THE CITY HAS CUSTOMARILY ALWAYS MOVED FORWARD WITH THE PRO E PR, US THUS ASKING FOR A POSTPONEMENT -- THE STAFF DOESN'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO PROCESS THAT POSTPONEMENT AND PULL IT FROM THE AGENDA. AND IT'S ON COUNCIL'S AGENDA. YOU VOTED ON THAT PREVIOUSLY, BECAUSE THIS -- THE ADMINISTRATION JUST DOESN'T PULL AN ITEM FROM THE COUNCIL WHEN IT'S REQUESTED BY A THIRD PARTY SUCH AS THE DEVELOPER.
02:21:58.221: >> Councilmember Bannister: OKAY. THANKS.
02:22:01.291: >> Councilmember Lumm: ANY OTHER COUNCILMEMBERS? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
02:22:04.027: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. WILL THIS THEN GO TO FIRST READING AFTER -- IF IT CAME BACK IN SOME FORM? BECAUSE WE ARE AT SECOND READING AND IT'S CHANGED IT TO SUCH A LARGE DEGREE THAT IT WOULD GO BACK TO FIRST READING?
02:22:19.075: >> I THINK THAT POTENTIAL EXISTS. IT WOULD ULTIMATELY BE DETERMINED BY WHAT ANY REVISIONS LOOK LIKE. WE WOULD WORK WITH THE ATTORNEY'S OFFICE IN CONSULTATION. WE WOULDN'T DO IT JUST FOR THE SAKE OF DOING IT, BUT IF WE THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS SUBSTANTIVE CHANGE, WE WOULD PROBABLY RECOMMEND THAT. THAT WOULD STILL BE A MUCH MORE EXPEDITED PROCESS THAN STARTING OVER AGAIN.
02:22:43.833: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU.
02:22:47.237: >> Councilmember Lumm: ANY OTHER COUNCILMEMBERS? THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ON B2, THE ORDINANCE TO AMEND THE ZONING MAP, AND THE MOTION BEFORE US TO POSTPONE TO SEPTEMBER 16th, TO EXPLORE OTHER ZONING OPTIONS. CLERK BEAUDRY, IF YOU WOULD TAKE A ROLL CALL VOTE ON THE POSTPONEMENT.
02:23:12.061: >> Clerk Beaudry: MAYOR TAYLOR ABSENT.
02:23:14.197: >> Councilmember Eaton: YES.
02:23:14.798: >> Councilmember Nelson:  YES.
02:23:17.600: >> Councilmember Smith: YES.
02:23:18.201: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES.
02:23:20.036: >> Councilmember Hayner:  NO.
02:23:20.703: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES.
02:23:23.239: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES.
02:23:26.176: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES.
02:23:26.876: >> Councilmember Grand: YES.
02:23:27.477: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES.
02:23:28.812: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION CARRIES.
02:23:29.779: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU. COUNCIL WILL TAKE A BRIEF -- LET'S SAY TEN-MINUTE MAX RECESS. [ BREAK ]
02:34:58.933: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU. B-3, AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND CHAPTER 55 (UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE), ZONING OF 1.19 ACRES FROM TWP (TOWNSHIP DISTRICT) TO R1A (SINGLE-FAMILY DWELLING DISTRICT), ERB-DOWNWARD/PICAZO PROPERTY, 2705 NEWPORT ROAD. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN. SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD. IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION OF B-3? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? PASSES. ORDINANCES AT FIRST READING. AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND CHAPTER 55 (ZONING), REZONING OF 0.54 ACRE FROM PUD (PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT) TO PUD (PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT), THE GLEN MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT PUD ZONING AND SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS, 201, 213, 215, 217 GLEN AVENUE AND 1025 EAST ANN STREET. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER. SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN. IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
02:36:24.453: >> Councilmember Hayner:  JUST BRIEFLY, I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THIS IS A SITUATION WHERE PUD HAS WORKED IN A TERRIFIC WAY FOR APPARENTLY THE APPLICANT AND THE NEIGHBORHOOD. WE GET FINE REPORTS FROM THE RELATIONSHIP THE NEIGHBORHOOD HAS HAD, THE OLD FOURTH WARD WITH THIS APPLICANT AND EVERYBODY SEEMS TO BE LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS -- FITTING IN THIS ON THIS LONG NEGLECTED SITE AND SO I APPRECIATE THE SMALL CHANGES HERE, HAVING TO GO BACK THROUGH THE SYSTEM. YOU KNOW, IT'S ASHAME THAT THAT'S THE WAY IT GOES. THE STATE SAYS SO. AND, YOU KNOW, THIS IS A PROJECT THAT IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYBODY IS LOOKING FORWARD TO, AND I THINK USING THE PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT APPROPRIATELY.
02:37:04.994: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU. ANY OTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT PASSES. DC-1, MOTION TO RECONSIDER THE AUGUST 5, 2019, VOTE THAT DEFEATED THE RESOLUTION TO PROCEED WITH A ROAD RECONFIGURATION PILOT FOR GREEN ROAD, FROM BURBANK TO PLYMOUTH ROAD. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRAND. DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN?
02:37:38.327: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MAYOR PRO TEM. OBVIOUSLY ON AUGUST 5th, THESE PROPOSED ROAD CONFIGURATIONS CAME BEFORE US, ONE ON EARHART, ONE ON TREVER WOOD AND ONE ON GREEN. THIS ONE CONCERNS GREEN ROAD. THE STAFF PREPARED A MEMO THAT OUTLINED THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS AND THE POTENTIAL RISKS OF EACH OF THESE PROPOSALS ON EARHART AND TRAVER WOOD, THOSE MEMOS SKEWED TOWARDS THE POTENTIAL BEN FETTS AND ON GREEN, THOSE BENEFITS AND POTENTIAL RISKS WERE A BIT MORE BALANCED AS YOU ENUMERATE THEM. DURING THE CONVERSATION, OUR COLLEAGUES MADE COMPELLING POINTS THAT ACTUALLY -- IT TOOK ME FROM ON THE FENCE TO VOTING AGAINST THIS RECONFIGURATION SINCERELY. THAT SAID, YOU KNOW, OVER TWO DAYS, AS I WAS MUSING IT, YOU KNOW, I HEARD VERY PRACTICAL OPPOSITION AT THE COUNCIL TABLE, AND HOPING TO DO SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE A POSITIVE MOVE FORWARD, TO TRY TO MAKE AS MANY STAKEHOLDERS HAPPY AS POSSIBLE AND BUILD SOME CONSENSUS AT THIS TABLE, WHICH I FEEL LIKE HAS BEEN SOMETIMES LACKING. I WANTED TO APPROACH STAFF ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF REDESIGNING ANY OF THESE. AS I LEARNED, THEY WERE ALREADY SOME CONVERSATIONS HAPPENING, AND I SUBMITTED SOME FEEDBACK -- PRACTICAL FEEDBACK ABOUT THE PLANS. AND THEN ABOUT A WEEK LATER, I GOT ON A PHONE CALL WITH STAFF TO REVIEW SOME REVISED PLANS WHICH I THOUGHT WERE APPROPRIATE AND WOULD BE BENEFICIAL TO DISCUSS AT THIS TABLE AND THAT IS WHEN I SENT AN EMAIL ALERTING EVERYONE THAT I WOULD BE BRINGING THIS BACK. I ALSO JUST NOTED IN THERE THAT OBVIOUSLY VOTING ON THE NEW REVISED PLANS TONIGHT WOULD BE IRRESPONSIBLE. I THINK IT WOULD BE BEST TO BE DONE IN ANOTHER COUPLE OF WEEKS. SO IF THIS IS BROUGHT BACK, I WOULD ALMOST IMMEDIATELY MOVE TO POSTPOPONE IT TO GIVE US THE NECESSARY TIME TO REVIEW THE NEW REVISED PLANS TO TALK ABOUT THEM WITH OUR CONSTITUENTS, IN PARTICULAR, COUNCILMEMBER LUMM AND COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD, AND ASK ANY QUESTIONS OF STAFF AND ENGINEERING THAT WE MAY HAVE. SO, YOU KNOW, I HOPE THAT THIS IS TAKEN AS SINCERE. I HOPE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN WORK ON, YOU KNOW, AND FOCUS ON THE PROPOSAL AND THE -- THE POTENTIAL BEN F BENEFITS OF THE PROPOSAL, BUT I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO DO THAT TONIGHT BECAUSE I DON'T THINK ANY OF US HAVE HAD ENOUGH TIME OR CONSIDERATION WITH THE NEW PLANS. SO THAT'S MY INTENT. THANK YOU.
02:40:30.065: >> Councilmember Lumm: COUNCILMB ER GRISWOLD.
02:40:31.066: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES, I MET WITH STAFF AND TALKED TO STAFF AND I REALLY APPRECIATED THAT AND IT'S NOT MY JOB TO DO THE DESIGN, BUT IT'S DEFINITELY OUR JOBS AS POLICYMAKERS TO ASK QUESTIONS, AND CONVEY SOME OF THE CONCERNS OF OUR CONSTITUENTS. SO I'M JUST WONDERING, BECAUSE I KNOW THAT RAYMOND HESS IS HERE AND HE MADE REFERENCE TO SOME NEW DESIGNS BUT I HAVEN'T SEEN THEM YET. ARE THEY FORTHCOMING OR WHAT'S THE STATUS?
02:41:01.530: >> Councilmember Lumm: MR. HESS?
02:41:05.234: >> City Admin. Lazarus: WHILE RRAYMOND IS COMING UP, I SENT THEM BY EMAIL TO ALL OF COUNCIL LAST WEEK.
02:41:17.546: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES.
02:41:18.146: >> Councilmember Griswold: LAST WEEK? AFTER WE MET ON THURSDAY?
02:41:26.221: >> City Admin. Lazarus: BEFORE.
02:41:26.889: >> Councilmember Griswold: OH, I WAS LOOKING FOR THEM ON LEGISTAR.
02:41:31.493: >> Councilmember Lumm: MR. HESS, IF YOU WOULD PLEASE JOIN US. DID YOU HEAR THE QUESTION?
02:41:37.833: >> MY UNDERSTANDING -- RAYMOND HESS, CITY STAFF. MADAM MAYOR PRO TEM, MY UNDERSTANDING IS CONSISTENT WITH THAT OF THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR. THIS WAS AN EMAIL BY COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN AND THEN A FOLLOW-UP EMAIL BY MR. LAZARUS WITH THE DESIGN.
02:42:03.659: >> Councilmember Lumm: COUNCILM.
02:42:04.559: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. CAN YOU BRIEFLY GIVE US AN UPDATE ON WHAT THE REVISED PLAN IS IN THAT AREA? IF POSSIBLE?
02:42:14.436: >> Councilmember Lumm: CAN I --
02:42:15.103: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: I'M.
02:42:17.673: >> Councilmember Lumm: IF I MAY JUST -- THIS IS A PROCESS, IF MAY JUST NOTE. THE PURPOSE OF A RECONSIDERATION IS TO CONDUCT A SECOND VOTE ON A SPECIFIC PROPOSAL RESOLUTION. THE REDESIGN IS NOT -- BECAUSE THAT WAS NOT PRESENTED ON AUGUS. THAT'S NOT WHAT IS BEFORE US. THIS IS -- RIGHT NOW, YOU ARE JUST CONSIDERING RECONSIDERATION OF WHAT WAS PREVIOUSLY PRESENTED TO COUNCIL.
02:42:43.598: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: FAIR ENOUGH AND I THINK I HAVE ASKED FOR A RECONSIDERATION BEFORE, AND I HAVE BEEN GIVEN, YOU KNOW, THE COURTESY OF MY COLLEAGUES FOR THAT. SO, YOU KNOW, I DO H OWE MY COLLEAGUES FOR THAT.
02:43:01.383: >> Councilmember Lumm: COUNCILM.
02:43:03.051: >> Councilmember Eaton: BECAUSE THE INTENTION OF THIS IS TO BRING BACK WHAT WE PREVIOUSLY DENIED, AND THEN CHANGE IT, I WOULD MUCH RATHER DENY THE RECONSIDERATION AND ASK STAFF TO ACTUALLY PRESENT THAT -- THOSE IDEAS TO THE MEETINGS THAT COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD AND OTHERS ARE HAVING WITH STAFF, FORMULATE A PLAN FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD AS A BRAND NEW RESOLUTION, RATHER THAN AS AN ATTEMPT TO AMEND A PREVIOUSLY DEFEATED RESOLUTION. AND SO I THINK THAT WOULD WORK BETTER. IT WOULD GIVE US THE SAME AMOUNT OF LEAD TIME TO CONSIDER IT, YOU KNOW. I'M NOT OPPOSED TO ENTERTAINING A DIFFERENT PLAN FOR THAT ROAD, BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT A MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION IS THE APPROPRIATE WAY TO DO IT. SO I WILL BE VOTING AGAINST THE MOTION TO RECONSIDER.
02:44:04.246: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER EATON. BECAUSE THIS IS A WARD 2 PROJECT, I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SHARE MY THOUGHTS, IF I MAY AND THEN I WILL CALL ON THE REST OF YOU. THE PURPOSE, AGAIN, OF A RECONSIDERATION IS TO CONDUCT A SECOND VOTE ON A SPECIFIC PROPOSAL, RESOLUTION, AND I CERTAINLY RESPECT COUNCILMEMBER'S RIGHT TO DO THAT, TO CHANGE THEIR VOTE ON A SPECIFIC PROPOSAL, BUT THAT IS NOT THE PURPOSE HERE. SO I WON'T BE SUPPORTING THE RECONSIDERATION, AND I WILL EXPLAIN. COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN HAS INDICATED HIS INTENT IS TO POSTPONE THE ITEM, ONCE IT IS PLACED BACK ON THE TABLE TO ALLOW TIME TO GO BACK AND STUDY ALTERNATIVES AND PERHAPS BRING FORWARD A NEW DIFFERENT PROPOSAL. THAT'S JUST NOT THE PROPER PROCESS. A RECONSIDERATION IS THE TOOL TO BE USED WITH REGARD TO A SPECIFIC PROPOSAL. TO CHANGE ONE'S VOTE ON THAT SPECIFIC PROPOSAL. RECONSIDERATION IS NOT THE APPROPRIATE APPROACH AS COUNCILMEMBER EATON JUST EXPLAINED TO CREATE A NEW DIFFERENT BUT RELATED PROPOSAL AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE WHICH, AGAIN, IS THE PURPOSE HERE. IF THE DESIRE IS TO STUDY ALTERNATIVES TO THE GREEN ROAD ROAD DIET PROJECT THAT WAS REJECTED AUGUST 5th AND PERHAPS COME BACK TO COUNCIL WITH A DIFFERENT PROPOSAL, THE MORE APPROPRIATE AND FRANKLY MUCH CLEANER APPROACH IS TO JUST COME BACK TO COUNCIL WITH THAT NEW PROPOSAL IF AND WHEN IT'S READY. SO I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING RECONSIDERATION TONIGHT. IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO RECONSIDER AND KEEP ALIVE A SPECIFIC PROPOSAL WHEN THE PURPOSE IS TO REPLACE IT WITH SOMETHING ELSE. IF THE RECONSIDERATION PASSES, AND THIS ITEM IS PLACED BACK ON THE TABLE, I WILL ALSO BE VOTING AINST A POSTPONEMENT. IN MY VIEW, POSTPONING THIS ITEM WILL JUST WASTE ADDITIONAL STAFF RESOURCES ON A -- ON WHAT I FEW AS A FUNDAMENTALLY FLAWED PROPOSAL. PRECIOUS RESOURCES, I'M QUITE SURE CAN BE PRODUCTIVELY UTILIZED ON OTHER PEDESTRIAN SAFETY MATTERS. THERE'S ALREADY BEEN A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF STAFF TIME INVESTED ON THE THREE ROAD DIET PROPOSALS INCLUDING THIS ONE ON GREEN, RESOURCES TO SUPPORT THE ORIGINAL REVIEWS IN JUNE AND THEN TO SUPPORT THE REFERRAL BACK TO THE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE AND THEN BACK TO COUNCIL ON AUGUST 5th AND THEN TO SUPPORT THE SPECIAL MEETINGS CALLED LAST WEEK. THE MAJOR CONCERNS ABOUT THIS GREEN ROAD PROPOSAL IS RELATED TO THE REDUCTION TO, ONE, NORTHBOUND LANE AND NARROWING THE LANE IN THE AREA IMMEDIATELY NORTH OF PLYMOUTH. THIS IS THE SECTION NEAR CVS, WHERE THERE'S VERY -- TRUST ME, I'M OUT THERE EVERY WEEK. VERY HEAVY TRAFFIC AND A NUMBER OF ON/OFF RAMPS COUPLED WITH FREQUENT BUS AND LARGE TRUCK TRAFFIC, AND WE KNOW THERE'S SEVEN BUS STOPS IN THIS -- IN AND AROUND THIS AREA. IT'S A SECTION THAT GENERATED MOST OF THE, QUOTE -- THIS IS -- I'M QUOTING STAFF. QUOTE CHARACTERISTICS DISCOURAGING A ROAD DIET, END QUOTE. STAFF HAD IDENTIFIED INITIALLY A NEIGHBORHOOD PUSHBACK, DESPITE WHAT OTHERS MAY HAVE SAID. JUST 18% OF THE SURVEY RESPONDENTS SUPPORTED THIS OPTION C. IN THE ALTERNATIVE ROAD DIET PROPOSAL THAT SURFACED IN MR. LAZARUS' EMAIL AUGUS AUGUST 14th, THERE'S ZERO, ZERO. ZERO CLANG  CHANGE TO THAT AREA. IT'S ONE NARROWED VEHICLE LANE TO THE PLYMOUTH AREA WITH THE BIKE LANE AS I DID ON AUGUST 5th, DRIVE THIS AREA IN PEAK TRAFFIC TIME AND TELL ME WHETHER YOU THINK ONE NARROWED NORTHBOUND LANE ON GREEN, IMMEDIATELY NORTH OF THE PLYMOUTH WILL ONE, CAUSE FRICTION OR QUOTE, CONFLICT WHICH IS, AGAIN, A STAFF DESCRIPTION. OR WHETHER YOU THINK IT MAY BE A REAL SAFETY RISK FOR EVERYONE. VEHICLES, CYCLES AND PEDESTRIANS. AND THEN ASK YOURSELF, AS COUNCILMEMBER NELSON DID, WHETHER YOU WOULD WANT TO BIKE IN THIS AREA. NO, THE PROPOSAL THAT SURFACED LAST WEEK MAKES A FEW TWEAKS BY ADDING RIGHT TURN LANES ON GREEN, I HAVE LOOKED AT, IT ON GREEN, COMMONWEALTH AND BURBANK BUT IT DOES NOT AT ALL ADDRESS THE PRIMARY CONCERN. ALSO IT'S WORTH MENTIONING THE MEMO FROM THE ADMINISTRATOR -- SORRY, INCORRECTLY INDICATED THAT THIS REVISED PROPOSAL OF LAST WEEK ADDED BACK A SOUTHBOUND TRAVEL LANE ON GREEN, BUT THAT IS NOT CORRECT. THE AUGUST 5th PROPOSAL ALREADY HAD TWO SOUTHBOUND TRAVEL LANES ON GREEN. SORRY, I HAVE GOTTEN INTO THE WEEDS ON THIS ONE. IN MY OPINION, AND AS MUCH AS WE MAY NOT LIKE IT OR MAY NOT WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE, IT THERE ARE JUST SOME ROADS AND SECTIONS WHERE ROAD DIETS ARE NOT APPROPRIATE AND THIS SECTION OF GREEN ROAD IS ONE OF THEM. AND WE CAN'T FORGET THAT WITH ALL THE NEW RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION IN NORTHEAST NASH, AGAIN, IS -- ANN ARBOR, AGAIN AS SOME HAVE DESCRIBED, OVER THE RECENT YEARS, WE DROPPED A NEW LITTLE CITY IN THIS PART OF THE TOWN. THE TRAFFIC VOLUMES ARE ONLY GOING TO INCREASE. IT'S ILL ADVISED IN MY VIEW TO TRY TO FORCE AN APPLICATION OF ANY CONCEPT, NO MATTER HOW MUCH WE BELIEVE IN THE CONCEPT, WHERE IT JUST DOES NOT FIT. AND I BELIEVE THAT'S THE CASE HERE, WITH A ROA DIET ON GREEN NEAR PLYMOUTH ROAD NEAR THIS INTERSECTION AND I FEAR IT MAY NOT JUST BE ILL ADVISED BUT IT MAY BE TRULY UNSAFE. SO THANK YOU FOR LISTENING TO ME. IT'S AN AREA, COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD AND I KNOW VERY WELL, AND WE HAVE A LOT OF -- I WILL SAY INFORMED VIEWS ON THIS MATTER. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
02:49:56.231: >> Councilmember Hayner:  AND WE'RE SPEAKING TO THE MOTION TO RECONSIDER THIS CORRECT?
02:49:59.901: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES.
02:50:00.502: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK BROADLY AND SUGGEST THAT WE ARE ABOUT TO HAVE THIS PROBLEM WITH A NEWLY ADOPTED MOTION TO RECONSIDER, PUT FORWARD BY COUNCILWOMAN NELSON, IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN, BECAUSE I -- MY UNDERSTANDING WAS THAT THIS IS THE SAME KIND OF SITUATION HERE, WHERE -- I MEAN, I VOTED FOR TRAVERWOOD, AND BECAUSE IT SEEMED TO IMPROVE SAFETY AND THEN I HAVE BEEN HEARING IN THE CONVERSATIONS THAT THERE MAY BE ANOTHER APPROACH THAT MAY EVEN BE -- HAVE A BETTER IMPROVEMENT TO SAFETY ON THAT STREET AND SO I -- JUST LIKE WE'RE DOING HERE WITH COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN'S SUGGESTION, I THINK THAT'S THE SAME THING HAPPENING FOR BOTH OF THESE. I THINK WE SHOULD TREAT THEM EQUALLY. IF WE VOTE DOWN THIS THING AND HAVE STAFF BRING IT BACK. I'M NOT SURE. BUT I THINK WE BROUGHT THIS UPON OURSELVES BY ASKING FOR THIS. THIS APPROVAL. THIS IS THE KIND OF THING THAT I BELIEVE IN THE PAST WOULD HAVE KIND OF HAPPENED ADMINISTRATIVELY AFTER SOME APPROVALS AND THEN THEY WOULD GO OUT AND DO THE WORK AND NOW WE HAVE TO -- PEOPLE ARE SEEING WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED BEHIND THE SCENES SO TO SPEAK, AND I THINK THAT'S FINE THAT WE ARE GIVEN THIS PROPER CONSIDERATION. I THINK THIS AND THE NEXT ONE ARE GOING TO BE -- ARE GOING TO NEED TO BE TREATED THE SAME. THAT'S ALL I WOULD LIKE TO SAY.
02:51:13.041: >> Councilmember Lumm: JUST TO CLARIFY WHEN YOU RECONSIDER, YOU ARE VOTING ON A SPECIFIC PROPOSAL, RESOLUTION THAT YOU VOTED ON PREVIOUSLY, NOT AN AMENDED, NOT A -- AS I KNOW WITH THE GREEN ROAD PROPOSAL, AGAIN WE RECEIVED THE EMAIL WITH THE PROPOSED REDESIGN. THAT'S NOT WHAT WE ARE ADDRESSING. SO I HOPE THAT HELPS CLARIFY. COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN. ZACK >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MAYOR PRO TEM. I DON'T REALLY CARE WHAT THE PROCESS IS FOR HOW WE GET TO LOOKING AT A NEW PROPOSAL. I JUST THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE DISCUSS THAT PUBLICLY AND TRY TO DO IT.
02:51:45.406: >> Councilmember Lumm: OKAY.
02:51:46.007: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  I MEAN THE REASON I DID PROPOSE A RECONSIDERATION, IT DID HAVE SOME THOUGHT BEHIND IT, WHICH I'M HAPPY TO SHARE BECAUSE WE WILL NEED TO APPLY IT TO COUNCILMEMBER NELSON'S COMING MOTION AS WELL. THE ONLY REASON THAT I LOOKED TOWARDS THIS INSTEAD OF JUST KIND OF STARTING FROM SCRATCH WAS THAT THE RESURFACING WAS SCHEDULED FOR NEXT WEEK AND I FIGURED THIS WOULD BE AIL LEGISLATIVE ACTION THAT WOULD -- A LEGISLATIVE ACTION THAT WOULD SHOW STAFF THAT WE AS A BODY WERE STILL INTERESTED IN DISCUSSING IT FURTHER BEFORE THE RESURFACING HAPPENED. SO, AGAIN, I DON'T REALLY CARE WHAT THE PROCESS IS OF HOW WE GET TO ANOTHER CONVERSATION. I JUST THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THAT CONVERSATION HAPPEN, AND WE CONSIDER, YOU KNOW, BETTER PLANS AS THEY COME FORWARD. BUT I JUST -- IT SEEMED TO ME TWO WEEKS AGO THAT THIS WOULD AT LEAST GIVE STAFF SOME CLARITY THAT WE AS A BODY, THROUGH A LEGISLATIVE ACTION, WE'RE STILL THINKING ABOUT IT, IF THAT MADE SENSE, AS OPPOSED TO SOME COUNCILMEMBERS ASKING.
02:52:45.833: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU S. MR. HUPY HERE? NO, YOU ARE HERE. SINCE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ROAD RESURFACING.
02:52:55.977: >> Councilmember Eaton: IS THIS ON THE MOTION TO RESURFACING.
02:53:00.081: >> Councilmember Lumm: NO, IT'S NOT.
02:53:01.182: >> Councilmember Eaton: POINT OF --
02:53:02.116: >> Councilmember Lumm: THIS HAS BEEN INTERJECTED AS A RATIONALE FOR RECONSIDERING THIS, BECAUSE THE ROAD RESURFACING IS PLANNED. I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT WE CAN RESURFACE A ROAD AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PAINT AND WE CAN PAINT IT --
02:53:18.533: >> Councilmember Ackerman: AND AGAIN, I'M NOT MARRIED TO ANY ONE PROCESS.
02:53:25.607: >> Councilmember Lumm: SO A QUESTION FOR MR. HUPY, IF YOU CAN SPEAK TO THAT. CAN YOU RESURFACE MILL AND RESURFACE THE ROAD?
02:53:32.647: >> YES, BUT THE -- IT'S NOT JUST PAINT. IF COUNCIL IS ASKING US TO COME BACK, THEN WE WOULD PROBABLY DO IT IN PAINT INSTEAD OF THERMAL PLASTIC, WHICH IS WHAT WE WOULD NORMALLY USE AFTER RESURFACING.
02:53:48.596: >> Councilmember Lumm: MM-HMM.
02:53:49.230: >> PAINT IS FAR CHEAPER AND EASIER PRODUCT TO REMOVE.
02:53:52.133: >> Councilmember Lumm: MM-HMM. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS? QUESTIONS? COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD?
02:54:04.545: >> Councilmember Griswold: ONE OF THE REASONS I RAISED THIS RIGHT AFTER OUR LAST VOTE IS I'M CONCERNED WITH THE TRANSITION, WHERE THE EXISTING ROAD DIET ENDS RIGHT NOW ON GREEN ROAD. BECAUSE IT'S REALLY AWKWARD AND SO I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WAS AT LEAST EXTENDED DOWN SO THAT IT WASN'T -- THE TRANSITION RIGHT NOW IS BASICALLY AT A CROSSWALK, AND SO IT JUST -- IT'S DISTRACTING WHEN YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING FOR PEDESTRIANS AT THE CROSSWALK. SO WHATEVER WE DO TODAY, I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD JUST SAY, DON'T DO ANYTHING AND LEAVE GREEN EXACTLY THE WAY IT IS, BECAUSE WE DO HAVE THAT PROBLEM.
02:54:46.521: >> Councilmember Lumm: OKAY. AND AGAIN WE ARE RECONSIDERING WHAT WAS BEFORE US ON AUGUST 5th. COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
02:54:51.225: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. WELL, I HAVE ALL DUE RESPECT FOR YOUR ANALYSIS, PAYE MAYOR PRO TI WOULD LIKE TO ASK MR. McDONALD TO WALK US THROUGH WHAT THE PROCEDURE IS, SINCE AS COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER POINTED OUT, WE WILL GO THROUGH THIS AGAIN AND HOPEFULLY JUST A FEW MINUTES. SO -- SO CAN WE BRING THIS BACK FOR A RECONSIDERATION AND THEN -- AND THEN HAVE A SECOND MOTION TO BRING BACK A MODIFIED PLAN? IS THAT PROCEDURALLY OKAY? OR IS THERE  AN ALTERNATIVE THAT CAN GET US THERE, PERHAPS IN A MORE EXPEDIENT MANNER THAT WOULD GET US TO THE SAME PLACE? BECAUSE I'M WITH COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN, I DON'T REALLY CARE WHAT THE PROCESS IS. I JUST WANT IT TO BE CORRECT.
02:55:44.545: >> LET ME REPEAT THE QUESTION TO MAKE SURE THAT I'M ANSWERING THE CORRECT QUESTION. SO I THINK THE PROPOSED PROCEDURE THAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT IS THERE BE -- AFTER THE MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION, IF THAT PASSES, THE ORIGINAL MOTION IS ON THE FLOOR, AND THAT WOULD OPEN THAT ORIGINAL MOTION BACK UP FOR DEBATE? THE CITY -- THE COUNCIL HAS DONE THIS BEFORE. ONCE THAT MOTION IS ON THE FLOOR, CAN YOU AMEND THE MOTION? I BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT YOU WERE ASKING?
02:56:12.273: >> Councilmember Grand: YES.
02:56:12.874: >> IT'S FUNNY, BECAUSE I HAVE KIND OF BEEN SITTING HERE TO JUST CONFIRM THAT, BECAUSE ROBERT'S RULES ARE DIFFICULT TO SAY THE LEAST. AND SO I WILL SAY THIS, GENERALLY, THE CITY HAS DONE THAT. THE COUNCIL HAS DONE THAT BEFORE. THAT IS ONCE YOU GET TO THE ORIGINAL MOTION, YOU HAVE KIND OF AMENDED IT. AND SO ONCE IT'S ON THE FLOOR, BUT YOU HAVE TO PASS THE ORIGINAL MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION FIRST, BEFORE THAT ORIGINAL MOTION COMES BACK.
02:56:42.703: >> Councilmember Grand: SO IN YOUR OPINION, THAT'S THE MORE EXPEDIENT WAY THAN JUST VOTING DOWN THE MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION AND HAVING STAFF COME BACK WITH A MODIFIED PLAN?
02:56:54.315: >> I THINK IT'S A -- I THINK IT'S A PREFERENCE ISSUE. NOT BEING FAMILIAR WITH THE DETAIL, I'M NOT SURE IF STAFF IS PREPARED -- IF YOU ARE PREPARED TO AMEND THAT ORIGINAL MOTION TONIGHT OR NOT.
02:57:08.563: >> Councilmember Lumm: UH-UH.
02:57:09.197: >> OR ARE WE JUST RECONSIDERING IT TO ASK STAFF TO DO SOME ADDITIONAL WORK?
02:57:13.534: >> Councilmember Grand: I THINK IT'S THAT. I THINK IT WAS -- WELL, AND IT'S COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN'S, BUT I THINK IT -- MY UNDERSTANDING WAS THAT IT WAS TO THEN POSTPONE IT ONE MORE MEETING TO COME BACK SO THAT COUNCIL COULD LOOK AT THE PLANS IN DETAIL, GET QUESTIONS ANSWERED AND PERHAPS AT THE MEETING ON SEPTEMBER 3rd, VOTE ON A -- YOU KNOW, VOTE IT UP OR DOWN. SO WHAT'S THE -- I'M ASKING PROCEDURALLY, WHAT'S THE BEST WAY TO GET THERE? BECAUSE --
02:57:41.028: >> WELL, I GUESS I WILL SAY THIS. I'M NOT SURE IF THERE'S A LEGAL DISTINCTION HERE. I THINK YOU HAVE TWO ALTERNATIVES THAT IT SOUNDS THAT WILL GET YOU TO A NEXT MEETING WHERE YOU ARE MAKING A DECISION. I GUESS I WOULD LOOK TO THE UNDERLYING INFORMATION AND IF THERE'S A PREFERENCE, THAT'S HOW -- WHERE YOU MAY SEEK THAT PREFERENCE, BUT I THINK THAT EITHER WAY, IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE GOING TO BE AT A FUTURE MEETING OR NEXT MEETING BEFORE YOU MAKE THAT DECISION.
02:58:08.322: >> Councilmember Lumm: I WILL JUST -- AGAIN, I HAVE SEEN THE REDESIGN, MR. LAZARUS. SO WE ARE BEING ASKED TO RECONSIDER WHAT WAS BROUGHT TO US ON AUGUST 5th, BUT THE END GAME HERE IS NOT ULTIMATELY REVISIT THAT, BUT A DIFFERENT PLAN. AND I THINK THE QUESTION, IF I MAY, THAT COUNCILMEMBER GRAND WAS ASKING IS WHAT'S THE CLEANER PATH FORWARD, JUST TO BRING FORWARD THE NEW PLAN AND CONSIDER THAT? INSTEAD OF BRINGING BACK ONE THAT'S GOING NOWHERE, FRANKLY. MR. LAZARUS?
02:58:46.527: >> City Admin. Lazarus: I AGREE WITH MR. McDONALD. YOU HAVE TWO DIFFERENT PATHS TO GET TO THE SAME PLACE. THE CHANGES ON GREEN ARE NOT -- YOU CAN DECIDE WHETHER THEY ARE SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH TO CALL A NEW PLAN OR MINOR REVISIONS. EITHER WAY, WE GET TO THE SAME PLACE. YOU CAN GET TO THE SAME PLACE TO CONSIDER THE NEXT MEETING. I THINK THE TIMING OF IT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE MECHANISM, BECAUSE WE DO WANT TO RESURFACE AND RESTRIPE AND YOU DON'T WANT TO LEAVE THE ROAD UNST UNSTRIPER I ALONG PERIOD OF TIME. I THINK WE ARE FINE WITH EITHER PATH THAT COUNCIL IS COMFORTABLE WITH SO YOU CAN LOOK AT REVISED DRAWINGS AT THE NEXT MEETING.
02:59:33.774: >> Councilmember Lumm: COUNCILM.
02:59:34.842: >> Councilmember Hayner:  IF WE APPROVE THE MOTION TO BRING BACK WHAT'S BEFORE US, AND THEN IF WE HAD A REVISED PLAN, WE CAN SAY WE WANT TO BRING THIS AMENDMENT AND VOTE ON THAT, RIGHT? BUT WE'RE NOT CERTAIN THAT WE HAVE THAT AND THE SAME MAY BE THE CASE FOR THE NEXT ONE. I DON'T THINK WE HAVE THAT PLAN IN FRONT OF US DO WE?
02:59:53.728: >> Councilmember Lumm: WELL, I'M HEARING THAT MOST PEOPLE DID NOT SEE IT.
02:59:56.030: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I COULD GO LOOK AT IT RIGHT NOW.
02:59:58.966: >> Councilmember Lumm: IT WAS SENT TO US ON THE 14th.
03:00:01.435: >> Councilmember Hayner:  AND THAT'S THE PLAN, IF THAT'S THE ONE, I DID SEE THAT. AND SO SOMEONE WOULD HAVE TO MOVE --
03:00:07.508: >> Councilmember Lumm: AGAIN, THAT'S NOT IN FRONT OF US.
03:00:09.510: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  IF I COULD. I THINK I WILL SAVE US SOME TIME.
03:00:12.546: >> Councilmember Lumm: SO WE HAVE ALL NOW TALKED MULTIPLE TIMES.
03:00:15.182: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  I THINK I WILL SAVE US SOME TIME. IF WE ALL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE'RE OKAY WITH HAVING A CONVERSATION, A PUBLIC CONVERSATION AND DEBATE ABOUT A REVISED PLAN, BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE FROM SOME PEOPLE ON COUNCIL, SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES THAT THE PREFERRED OPTION WOULD BE JUST TO LET THE AUGUS AUGUST 5th VOTE GO DOWN AND LOOK FORWARD TO A NEW REVISED PLAN, COMING BACK TO COUNCIL. IF THAT'S THE PREFERRED ROUTE, I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO WITHDRAW THE MOTION TO RECONSIDER. THAT'S JUST A MEANS TO AN END FOR ME. I REALLY DON'T CARE.
03:00:50.718: >> Councilmember Lumm: OKAY.
03:00:51.352: >> Councilmember Eaton: IF I MAY.
03:00:52.987: >> Councilmember Lumm: COUNCILMB ER EATON.
03:00:54.121: >> Councilmember Eaton: SO TO RESPOND TO COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER'S CONCERN, THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THIS AND THE NEXT RESOLUTION IS THAT THE NEXT RESOLUTION WILL BRING BACK SOMETHING THAT WAS APPROVED, AND HOPEFULLY THAT WILL BE DENIED AND SENT BACK TO STAFF TO ALSO RECONFIGURE THAT SO THERE'S TWO BIKE LANES BUT WE WILL JUST SIMPLY BE DISPENSING WITH THAT PREVIOUSLY APPROVED PLAN AND ASKING STAFF TO BRING SOMETHING ELSE, JUST LIKE WE ARE BRINGING STAFF TO BRING SOMETHING ELSE FOR GREEN ROAD. SO I THINK THAT THEY ARE VERY CONSISTENT. THERE'S NO INCONSISTENCY THERE. WHAT WE ARE DOING IS WE ARE SAYING NO TO BOTH OF THESE PLANS AND ASKING FOR SOMETHING DIFFERENT. TO COME FORWARD AS A NEW RESOLUTION ON SOME FUTURE COUNCIL AGENDA.
03:01:49.043: >> Councilmember Hayner:  AND THEN TO SPEAK WHAT'S BEFORE US, WHICH IS RECONSIDERATION, A NO TO THIS RECONSIDERATION SENDS IT BACK TO A NO STATE WHERE STAFF CAN FEEL FREE TO BRING FORWARD A REVISED PLAN AND A NO ON THE NEXT ONE, ALTHOUGH I VOTED FOR THAT ONE, IS HOPEFUL NO FOR ME, YOU ARE SUGGESTING THAT IT IS ALSO THEN DEFEATED WHERE IT WASN'T BEFORE CANE IT COME BACK WITH A PLAN THAT ALSO SUPPORT. IS THAT WHAT I HEAR YOU SAYING?
03:02:19.306: >> Councilmember Eaton: YES.
03:02:21.775: >> Councilmember Lumm: SO ARE YOU PROPOSING?
03:02:22.776: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YEAH, I'M HAPPY TO WITHDRAW.
03:02:25.746: >> Councilmember Eaton: DOES THAT TAKE ANY, BY COUNCIL?
03:02:29.116: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  I THINK THE SECOND NEEDS TO APPROVE THAT.
03:02:31.652: >> Councilmember Eaton: I WILL SECOND THAT.
03:02:32.887: >> Councilmember Ackerman: SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER EATON. VOTE ON THE WITHDRAW.
03:02:41.362: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I JUST WANT TO --
03:02:46.100: >> Councilmember Lumm: TO THE WITHDRAW.
03:02:47.601: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I JUST WANT TO THANK COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN IN MOVING THAT TRYING TO MOVE THE BALL EVER SO SLOWLY. I WILL SAVE COMMENT FOR THE NEXT MOTION.
03:02:58.479: >> Councilmember Lumm: OKAY. IT IS WITHDRAWN. THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER, ACKERMAN. IN THE MEANTIME, I WOULD ASK THAT, YEAH, YOU ALL JUST CHECK YOUR EMAIL BECAUSE THE REVISED PLAN IS THERE, AND YOU HEARD ME SPEAK TO IT. SO DC-2. THE MOTION TO RECONSIDER THE RESOLUTION TO PROCEED WITH A ROAD RECONFIGURATION PILOT FOR TREYORWOOD DRIVE FROM HURON PARKWAY TO PLYMOUTH ROAD. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER NELSON, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD. COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
03:03:37.585: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I -- I WAS ON THE WINNING SIDE OF THIS ONE AND SO AS A FAVOR TO MY COLLEAGUES WHO VOTED AGAINST IT, I'M -- I'M OFF OFFERING A RECONSIDERATION OF THIS. I WILL ASK MY COLLEAGUES TO EXPLAIN THEIR THINKING ON IT. IT'S NOT IN MY WARD. I'M OPENING UP ROOM FOR CONVERSATION, FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE MORE EXPERT IN THIS WARD.
03:04:02.743: >> Councilmember Lumm: COUNCILM.
03:04:03.711: >> Councilmember Hayner: WELL, I SUPPORTED THIS AND SO THE ONLY REASON I WOULD VOTE IT DOWN NOW IS IF STAFF WAS COMING BEFORE ME AND SAYING THAT THAT THE IMPROVEMENTS THAT THEY THOUGHT WERE EVEN BETTER THAN WHAT I APPROVED LAST TIME, RIGHT? I MEAN, I SUPPORTED THIS FULLY LAST TIME. I HAD SOME RESERVATIONS ABOUT THE NEED FOR PARKING AND I HAD CONCERNS THAT WERE EXPRESSED BY FOLKS AT THE PUBLIC HEARING FOR THIS, THAT I THINK I SAW MAYOR PRO TEM LUMM AND COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD AT AND THE LEGITIMATE CONCERNS THAT PARKING IS NOT REALLY DOWN THIS PATH OF ROAD DIETING. IT WAS A LEFT FIELD THROW-IN THERE. NONETHELESS, I SUPPORTED IT. I'M LOATHED TO VOTE AGAINST SOMETHING THAT I SUPPORTED, UNLESS WE COME BACK WITH SOMETHING BETTER.
03:04:55.896: >> Councilmember Lumm: WE HAVE THE SPECIFIC PROPOSAL FOR US AND MR. HESS, I HAVE NOT SEEN, UP LIKE GREEN ROAD, I'M NOT AWARE THAT THERE HAVE BEEN MEETINGS OR DISCUSSIONS ABOUT DIRECTING STAFF TO COME BACK WITH A DIFFERENT PROPOSAL FOR TRAVERWOOD, COULD YOU SPEAK TO THAT? YES. WE WITH RESPECT ANTICIPATING THE DISCUSSION TONIGHT. SO WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY MATERIALS PREPARED. BUT I -- WE DID MENTION, I BELIEVE, AT ONE OF THE CITY COUNCIL MEETINGS WHERE THIS WAS DISCUSSED THAT WE WOULD HAPPILY COME BACK WITH A PROPOSAL THAT INCLUDED BIKE LANES ON BOTH SIDES THAT THE IMPACT IN TERMS OF A ROAD DIET IS THE SAME, IN TERMS OF WHETHER YOU ARE USING THAT REALLOCATED SPACE FOR PARKING OR BIKE LANES. SO THE ACTUAL IMPACT AND ALL THE METRICS WE GAVE YOU IN TERMS OF IMPACT TO VEHICLE DELAY AND ALL OF THAT, STILL REMAIN THE SAME BECAUSE IT'S STILL THE SAME NUMBER THE LANES AND IT'S JUST A QUESTION OF WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THE EXTRA PAVEMENT. REALLY IT'S JUST A DESIGN CONSIDERATION AND IF COUNCIL GIVES US DIRECTION IN TERMS OF WHAT THE DESIGN IS, IF IT'S FOR AN ADDED BIKE LANE, WE CAN GLADLY COME BACK WITH THAT, IF THAT'S DIRECTION WE GET.
03:06:06.834: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU. COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
03:06:11.205: >> Councilmember Griswold:  IT WOULD BE GREAT TO HAVE BIKE LANES ON BOWE SIDES. MY ONLY OTHER CONCERN WAS FROM A COMMENT THAT COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER SAID, THAT THE NON-MOTORIZED TRANSPORTATION PLAN ASKED THAT -- OR SPECIFIED THAT SUB 11-FOOT LANES REQUEST ADDITIONAL ENGINEERING AND KNOWING THAT A BUS WITH THE MILMIRRORS OUT IS 10 FEET WIDE. I HAD SOME CONCERN BECAUSE WE DEFINITELY WANT TO ENCOURAGE MASS TRANSIT AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BUSES CAN MOVE THROUGH THERE COMFORTABLY.
03:06:49.977: >> I THINK THE GOOD NEWS IS THE BUFFER HELPS WITH THAT, RIGHT? THESE WOULD BE BUFFERED BIKE LANES AND SO THE -- YOU KNOW, THEY WOULD ALLOW FOR THE SAFE PASSAGE OF THE TRANSIT VEHICLE AND NOT CONFLICTING WITH OTHER USERS OF THE ROADWAY.
03:07:08.829: >> City Admin. Lazarus: I HAVE PUT 10-FOOT LANES IN IN OTHER LOCATIONS WITHOUT A PROBLEM. BUT AS HE SAID, THE BUFFER NEGATES THE ISSUE OF THE OVERHANG OF THE MIRRORS.
03:07:22.910: >> Councilmember Lumm: COUNCILM.
03:07:23.777: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. JUST ANOTHER PROCEDURAL QUESTION S. THERE ANY REASON WHY WE COULDN'T -- IF EVERYONE IS IN AGREEMENT, THAT WE JUST HAVE TWO BIKE LANES INSTEAD OF PARKING, WHY WE CAN'T JUST VOTE FOR THAT THIS EVENING AND JUST AMEND IT.
03:07:38.125: >> Councilmember Lumm: THIS IS ON THE RECONSIDERATION?
03:07:39.793: >> Councilmember Grand: RIGHT, BUT CAN WE VOTE ON A RECONSIDERATION AND THEN JUST SAY, MR. HESS, PLEASE PUT TWO BIKE LANES INSTEAD OF PARKING AND MOVE FORWARD?
03:07:49.269: >> Councilmember Lumm: EVEN THOUGH THIS PROPOSAL IS NOT BEFORE US?
03:07:54.641: >> Councilmember Grand: IT SEEMS LIKE MOST PEOPLE ARE HAPPY WITH THAT.
03:07:57.845: >> Councilmember Lumm: I HAVE A FOLLOW-ON QUESTION TO COUNCILMEMBER GRAND'S REQUEST. WHEN THIS CAME BEFORE US ON AUGUST 5th, YOU OR SOMEONE SHARED WITH US THAT WHEN ASKED WHY -- WHY AT PARKING ON TRAVERWOOD, THAT IT WAS BEING PROPOSED IN RESPONSE TO REQUESTS FROM BOTH THE ANN ARBOR PUBLIC LIBRARY, AND THE ISLAMIC CENTER. AND I'M PRESUMING THAT THEIR DESIRE FOR PARKING THERE HAS NOT CHANGED, BUT I THINK BEFORE WE GO FORWARD, AND JUST AUTOMATICALLY MAKE THIS CHANGE TONIGHT, WHICH I'M HAVING DIFFICULTY WITH, SINCE THAT'S NOT WHAT'S BEFORE US, BUT I SUPPOSE WE COULD JUST AMEND IT, TO GET THAT FEEDBACK FROM THEM AGAIN. AND JUST TO CONFIRM THAT THIS WILL NOT NEGATIVELY IMPACT THEIR OPERATIONS. I -- WAS THERE ANY -- WERE THERE ANY OTHER -- BECAUSE THE FEEDBACK ON THIS WAS MINIMAL FROM THE RESIDENTS IN THE AREA, EXCEPT FOR THE LIBRARY AND THE ISLAMIC CENTER FOLKS.
03:09:05.012: >> SO JUST SO I CAN CLARIFY, WOULD YOU ASK US TO REACH BACK OUT TO CONFIRM THE --
03:09:10.150: >> Councilmember Lumm: I SUPPOSE THEY ARE NOT GOING TO CHANGE THEIR POSITION BUT IF WE ARE DOING THIS ON THE FLY AS PROPOSED. YOU KNOW, THAT FEEDBACK WOULD ALWAYS BE HELPFUL.
03:09:19.126: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I HAVE THE FEEDBACK FROM THE MOSQUE.
03:09:22.829: >> Councilmember Lumm: I'M SORRY?
03:09:23.597: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I HAVE THE FEEDBACK FROM THE MOSQUE. THE MOSQUE NEEDS PARKING ON FRIDAY AFTERNOONS STARTING AT 1:00. AND SO ONE OF THE CONCERNS IS THAT IF IT'S USED AS COMMUTER PARKING, SORT OF LIKE A PARK-AND-RIDE LOT, THAT THE PARKING WOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE AT 1:00. SO THAT'S THE ONLY TIME THEY NEED ADDITIONAL PARKING.
03:09:50.891: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
03:09:54.595: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I CAN ONLY IMAGINE HOW STAFF FEELS RIGHT NOW. I WILL NOT BE VOTING FOR RECONSIDERATION. I'M GETTING FRUSTRATED DOWN HERE. THIS CAME TO COUNCIL ONCE. WE KICKED IT BACK DOWN TO TRANSPORTATION. IT CAME BACK TO COUNCIL. WE DEBATED IT. WE VOTED. NOW IT'S COMING BACK TO COUNCIL. NOW WE ARE DEBATING IT AND NOW WE WILL MAKE CHANGES ON THE FLY. I THINK THIS IS GETTING A LITTLE BIT OUT OF HAND. I THINK WE NEED TO VOTE AND MOVE ON, MAKE DECISIONS AND MOVE ON. WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO RUN THIS CITY AND ITS $400 MILLION BUDGET IN THIS FASHION. AND I'M -- I'M REALLY GETTING ANNOYED. , TO BE HONEST WITH YOU. AND WE NEED TO MAKE VOTES, BRING UP THE QUESTIONS AND STAFF HAS BEEN VERY RESPONSIVE AND NOW WE ARE GOING BACK AND FORTH. AND THIS IS JUST GETTING TO BE LUDICROUS, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU. IT'S BANANAS!
03:11:12.673: >> Councilmember Lumm: COUNCILM.
03:11:13.974: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I AM EQUALLY FRUSTRATED BUT WE DO NOT HAVE A VISION ZERO LEADER. WE HAVE AN OPEN POSITION RIGHT NOW. WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE TO FILL IT, AND PEOPLE DIE ON ROADWAYS WHEN WE MAKE SIMPLE LITTLE OVERSIGHTS. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE GET THIS RIGHT. AND STAFF IS BEHIND THIS CHANGE. IN FACT BEING RAYMOND HESS OFFERED IT AS AN ALTERNATIVE AT THE LAST MEETING. SO I DON'T SEE THIS AS A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE. AND TO ADD TO THAT, IN JULY OF THIS YEAR, STAFF REPORTED EIGHT PEDESTRIAN CRASHES. THE FIVE-YEAR AVERAGE IS 2.1. WE HAVE A CRISIS IN THIS COMMUNITY AND IT DEMANDS THAT WE STEP UP AND ADDRESS IT AND MAKE SURE THAT WHAT WE ARE DOING IS IN LINE WITH VISION ZERO AND IT WILL CREATE A SAFER ENVIRONMENT.
03:12:11.765: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU. SO I'M HOPING AT THIS JUNCTURE WE CAN TAKE THE VOTE ON THE RECONSIDERATION. COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
03:12:20.574: >> Councilmember Nelson:  ONLY BECAUSE -- ONLY BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE PECULIAR, I -- I ACTUALLY SHARE SOME OF COUNCIL MEMBER'S RAMLAWI'S SENTIMENTS ON THIS ISSUE. I WAS WILLING TO BRING THIS UP FOR RECONSIDERATION TO OPEN UP CONVERSATION BUT I'M NOT FEELING A LOT OF -- A LOT OF SOLID ARGUMENT ABOUT WHY WE ARE KIND OF COMING UP WITH OUR OWN PLAN FOR THIS. I HAD RESERVATIONS ABOUT PUTTING PARKING ON ONE SIDE AND ONLY A BIKE LANE ON ONE SIDE, BUT I WAS HAPPY FOR US TO MOVE ON. AT ANY RATE, EVEN THOUGH I BROUGHT THIS UP, THAT'S THE REASON I WILL VOTE AGAINST IT BECAUSE I DON'T FEEL LIKE WE ARE HAVING A REAL PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATION ABOUT SPECIFIC REASONS WHY WE'RE SWITCHING THIS UP. AND WE WERE ACTUALLY SORT OF -- WE HAD A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WERE ARGUING TO US THAT THE PROPOSALS THAT WE WERE CONSIDERING AT THE LAST MEETING WERE VERY PRECISE AND SCIENTIFIC AND NOW IT TURNS OUT THAT WE CAN ARBITRARILY CHANGE THEM. EVEN IF STAFF IS IN SUPPORT OF IT, ITS REALLY PECULIAR TO ME. THANK YOU.
03:13:26.606: >> Councilmember Lumm: COUNCILMB ER -- CLERK BEAUDRY, WILL YOU PLAY TAKE THE ROLL.
03:13:32.546: >> Clerk Beaudry: MAYOR TAYLOR ABSENT.
03:13:37.017: >> Councilmember Eaton: YES.
03:13:37.617: >> Councilmember Nelson:  NO.
03:13:40.620: >> Councilmember Smith: NO.
03:13:41.221: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  NO.
03:13:42.722: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES.
03:13:43.323: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES.
03:13:45.158: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES.
03:13:48.328: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES.
03:13:52.399: >> Councilmember Grand: YES.
03:13:52.999: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES.
03:13:54.901: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION CARRIES.
03:14:02.542: >> Councilmember Lumm: OKAY. IF I UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS CORRECTLY, THE RESOLUTION TO LEAD WITH THE TRAVERWOOD DRIVE IS BEFORE YOU FOR YOUR RECONSIDERATION. COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
03:14:18.358: >> Councilmember Eaton: SO I WOULD LIKE TO SEND THIS BACK TO STAFF AND I DON'T CARE WHETHER WE VOTE NO ON THIS AND THEN ASK THEM TO BRING BACK A TWO BIKE LANE PLAN. OR IF WE ADAPT A TWO BIKE LANE PLAN THAT'S NOT CURRENTLY IN FRONT OF US. BUT THIS ROAD WILL BE SAFER FOR BICYCLISTS IF WE HAVE A BICYCLE LANE ON EACH SIDE OF THE ROAD. AND THE RESOLUTION WE PASSED AT THE LAST MEETING DIDN'T INCLUDE THAT AND SO I DON'T HAVE A STRONG PREFERENCE AS TO HOW WE REJECT THE PREVIOUS PLAN AND ASK FOR A BIKE LANE ON EACH SIDE, BUT I THINK THAT'S THE SAFEST WAY TO -- TO ADDRESS THE TRAFFIC ON THIS PARTICULAR STREET.
03:15:10.477: >> Councilmember Lumm: COUNCILM.
03:15:13.380: >> Councilmember Smith: I MAKE -- I DEFER TO MR. LAZARUS WHO WAS RAISING HIS HAND FOR A PROCESS QUESTION.
03:15:21.855: >> Councilmember Lumm: OKAY. MR. LAZARUS?
03:15:24.557: >> City Admin. Lazarus: FROM AN ENGINEERING STANDPOINT, I WOULD PREFER NOT TO HAVE ENGINEERING DONE ON THE FLY BY NON-LICENSED PROFESSIONALS. SO MY PREFERENCE WOULD BE THAT COUNCIL WANTS US TO RECONSIDER, YOU WOULD NOT TRY AND DESIGN A SOLUTION THIS EVENING.
03:15:38.505: >> Councilmember Lumm: OKAY.
03:15:39.706: >> City Admin. Lazarus: AND LET MR. HUPY, MR. HUTCHINSON AND TEAM COME BACK WITH A SIGN THAT THEY ARE COMFORTABLE WITH, UNDERSTAND THE DESIRES OF COUNCIL.
03:15:49.916: >> Councilmember Smith: SO I WOULD MAKE A MOTION TO POSTPONE THIS MATTER UNTIL -- HOW LONG DO YOU NEED? SEPTEMBER 16th?
03:16:02.095: >> City Admin. Lazarus: SEPTEMB.
03:16:02.896: >> Councilmember Lumm: 3rd IS THE NEXT MEETING.
03:16:04.531: >> Councilmember Smith: I MAKE A MOTION TO POSTPONE THIS UNTIL SEPTEMBER 3rd MEETING FOR THE PURPOSE OF STAFF PROVIDING AN ALTERNATIVE WITH BIKE LANES ON BOTH SIDES.
03:16:15.308: >> Councilmember Lumm: IS THERE SUPPORT FOR POSTPONEMENT. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER? TO THE POSTPONEMENT. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
03:16:25.418: >> Councilmember Hayner:  TO SHARE MY FAR END COMPATRIOTS, WHY DIDN'T WE DO THIS FOR THE FIRST ONE? WHAT JUST HAPPENED THERE?
03:16:36.129: >> Councilmember Lumm: I CAN SPEAK TO THAT.
03:16:38.098: >> Councilmember Hayner: YEAH, I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS POSTPONEMENT TO ALLOW STAFF TO TO BRING BACK THE PROPER ENGINEERING FOR US.
03:16:46.573: >> Councilmember Lumm: IF I MAY, I WILL ADDRESS YOUR QUESTION, COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, I VOTED FOR THIS RECRATION. WHY? BECAUSE THE TWO COUNCILMEMBERS THAT REPRESENT THIS AREA DESIRED TO HAVE IT RECONSIDERED. SO I WILL DEFER TO MY COLLEAGUES WOULD REPRESENT A GIVEN AREA. ON GREEN ROAD, WHAT DID YOUR WARD 2 COLLEAGUES WANT? I WISH THAT WE WOULD HAVE RECEIVED THE SAME CONSIDERATION, FRANKLY, FROM OUR COLLEAGUES. THAT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT WE DID NOT. I WILL ALWAYS DEFER TO THE WARD REPRESENTATIVE OF A GIVEN AREA ON AN ISSUE THAT AFFECTS THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS. SO THAT WAS IN THAT REGARD AN EASY CALL FOR ME. I WILL SAY, AGAIN, THAT AS I SAID ON AUGUST 5th, WHEN THIS CAME BEFORE US, THAT I COULD GO EITHER WAY. I HEARD THAT THERE WAS AN INTEREST IN ADDING PARKING, TO ADDRESS CONCERNS PRESENTED BY THE LIBRARY, AND THE ISLAMIC CENTER, AND AS YOU KNOW, WHEN I SAID I COULD GO EITHER WAY, WHAT DID I DO ON AUGUST 5th. I SHOVED MY CHAIR BACK AND SAID, WHAT DO YOU WANT, BECAUSE I'M DEFERRING TO YOU. YOU REPRESENT THIS AREA, AND YOU EXPRESSED TO ME YOUR DESIRES AND SO I VOTED ACCORDINGLY. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE US DO MORE OF THAT, FRANKLY. AND IT SHOULD BE INTUITIVE, IN MY VIEW, BUT ANYWAY, THAT EXPLAINS MY VOTE ON WHAT JUST HAPPENED. I HOPE THAT'S HELPFUL.
03:18:22.936: >> Councilmember Hayner:  IT IS AND A REMINDER THAT I VOTED AGAINST GREEN ON AUGUST 5th.
03:18:29.943: >> Councilmember Lumm: COUNCILM? DID YOU --
03:18:34.214: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY AT THIS POINT. YOU KNOW, I'M A CYCLIST. SOME YEARS I CYCLE 5, 6,000 MILES A YEAR. SINCE JOINING COUNCIL AND CAMPAIGNING, THAT IS DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY. CARS THAT ARE PARKED ON THE ROAD ACTUALLY HELP SLOW TRAFFIC DOWN. OKAY? SO IF YOU ARE A CYCLIST, YOU KNOW THE DANGERS OF BEING DOORED. YOU DON'T RIDE THAT CLOSE TO PARKED CARS. SO THIS NOTION THAT CARS PARKED ON ONE SIDE OF THE STREET POSE A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER RISK TO CYCLISTS IS AN OPINION. IT'S NOT FACTUAL, IN MY OPINION. WE HAD ADVOCATES IN HERE ADVOCATING FOR THIS, AND IT'S JUST, AGAIN, -- I'M JUST GOING BANANAS DOWN HERE. I'M JUST FRUSTRATED. I DON'T SEE HOW WE WILL MAKE ANY DECISIONS IF WE ARE, LIKE THIS. THIS IS AMAZING! AND, YOU KNOW, AGAIN, BACK TO THE PROCEDURAL QUESTION THAT COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER BROUGHT UP. IT JUST SEEMS LIKE WE ARE PICKING AND CHOOSING. ANOTHER POINT HERE IS THAT, YES, I DO DEFER TO MY COUNCIL REPS WHEN ISSUES ARE IN THEIR WARD, BUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT TRANSPORTATION, YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT CONNECTIVITY. YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THINGS THAT TRANSCEND WARDS. AND WE CANNOT HAVE DECISIONS MADE SOLELY BASED ON WHAT THOSE WARD REME REPS SAY WHEN IT COMEO TRANSPORTATION. THAT WILL LEAD US TO A HODGEPODGE OF SOLUTIONS. I THINK IT'S NOT A FAIR ASSUMPTION TO PUT ON THAT WE ARE GOING TO DEFER THESE TYPE OF DECISIONS TO WARD REPS AS MUCH AS SOME OTHER ISSUES. TRANSPORTATION AFFECTS US ALL, NO MATTER WHAT PART OF THE CITY WE ARE IN, WE ARE TRYING TO GET THROUGH IT, AND IT'S NOT A WARD-SPECIFIC ISSUE, AS SOME OTHER MATTERS MAY BE. THANK YOU.
03:21:03.329: >> Councilmember Lumm: COUNCILMM BER EATON.
03:21:05.131: >> Councilmember Eaton: ARE WE VOTING ON A MOTION TO POSTPONE?
03:21:08.167: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES, WE ARE. ANY OTHER COMMENTS ON THE MOTION TO POSTPONE. CLERK BEAUDRY, WILL YOU TAKE THE ROLL CALL VOTE.
03:21:14.407: >> Clerk Beaudry: MAYOR TAYLOR ABSENT.

03:21:40.700: >> Councilmember Eaton: WE HAVE ONE MORE THING.
03:21:44.837: >> Councilmember Lumm: OH, I'M SORRY. MY APOLOGIES. DB-1, THE RESOLUTION TO APPROVE THE GARNET SITE PLAN AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT, 325 EAST SUMMIT STREET, PLANNING COMMISSION RECOMMENDATION TO APPROVE. MOVED BY? COUNCILMEMBER EATON. SECONDEDBY COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN. DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
03:22:08.661: >> Councilmember Eaton: BEFORE THE DEVELOPER LEFT, I SAID THAT I WOULD ASK FOR POSTPONEMENT. IF IT TURNS OUT THAT IT BE THE FIRST READING OF THE ZONING ORDINANCE, WE MAY HAVE TO POSTPONE THIS YELTSIN AGAIN BUT I WILL MOVE TO POSTPONE IT TO SEPTEMBER 16th.
03:22:31.417: >> SECOND.
