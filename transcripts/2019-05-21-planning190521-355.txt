00:00:44.044: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  THANK YOU. MR. LENART, DO YOU HAVE A REPORT FOR US THIS EVENING?
00:00:49.483: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  NO REPORT.
00:00:50.684: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  PLANNING OFFICERS AND COMMITTEES, ANYONE ELSE HAVE REPORTS? WRITTEN COMMUNICATIONS AND PETITIONS, WE HAVE QUITE A BIT OF WRITTEN COMMUNICATIONS, SO PLEASE REVIEW THAT. AND NOW WE ARE MOVING ON TO AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION. AT THIS TIME, IF THERE IS ANYBODY WHO WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION REGARDING AN ITEM THAT IS NOT ON THE AGENDA, YOU WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION AT THIS TIME. SO IF YOU'RE HERE TO SPEAK ON AN ITEM THAT IS NOT LATER ON IN OUR AGENDA, PLEASE STEP FORWARD, STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS FOR THE RECORD, AND YOU'LL HAVE UP UP TO THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE COMMISSION.
00:01:28.322: >> THANKS. I LIVE AT 2387 HILLDALE. I THINK I WILL SPEAK LATER ON ABOUT AN ITEM. RIGHT NOW I'M HERE TO THANK COMMISSIONERS TRUDEAU AND WEATHERBEE FOR THEIR SERVICE ON THE PLANNING COMMISSION. I DON'T KNOW EITHER OF YOU PERSONALLY. I HAVE LEARNED A LOT DURING YOUR DELIBERATIONS. IN MANY WAYS, IT'S CHANGED THE WAY I THINK ABOUT OUR CITY TRANSPORTATION, SUSTAINABILITY, AND I'M VERY SORRY THAT YOU WEREN'T REAPPOINTED, BUT YOU HAVE MADE AN IMPACT, SO I HOPE YOU FEEL GOOD ABOUT THAT. THANKS.
00:02:06.860: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYBODY ELSE WHO WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION REGARDING AN ITEM THAT IS NOT ON THE AGENDA? SEEING NO ONE, MOVING ON TO PUBLIC HEARINGS SCHEDULED FOR OUR NEXT BUSINESS MEETING.
00:02:24.545: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  FOR OUR JUNE 4TH BUSINESS MEETING, WE HAVE A COUPLE OF NEW ITEMS. WE'LL HAVE A SERIES OF PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE, INCLUDING SECTION 5.174 TO CORRECT AN ERROR IN THE DIMENSIONAL TABLE, AND IN SECTION 5.18.6 TO EVALUATE CHANGES IN PREMIUM OPTIONS AS IT RELATES TO HOUSING AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING. ADDITIONALLY, WE WILL HAVE A PUBLIC HEARING FOR A PROPOSED MEDICAL MARIJUANA PROVISIONING CENTER. THIS IS AN EXPANSION OF A PREVIOUSLY REWARDED SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE PERMIT LOCATED AT 2793 PLYMOUTH ROAD.
00:03:06.119: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. WE ARE NOW IN REGULAR BUSINESS, AND OUR FIRST ITEM IS THE SIGN ORDINANCE AMENDMENTS FOR CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL. THIS EVENING WILL BEGIN WITH OUR CONSULTANTS, WHO WILL GIVE A 20-MINUTE PRESENTATION. FROM THERE, WE WILL HAVE A STAFF REPORT, FOLLOWED BY A PUBLIC HEARING AND THEN DISCUSSION. SO...
00:03:28.308: >> GOOD EVENING. JILL BANE WITH GIFLS WEBSTER. IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU ALL AS WE LOOK FORWARD TO -- WELL, I SHOULDN'T SAY LOOK FORWARD TO ENDING THE PROJECT, BECAUSE WE HAVE CERTAINLY ENJOYED WORKING WITH YOU, OTHER BOARD MEMBERS AND STAFF. BUT IT'S TIME FOR ALL GOOD PROJECTS TO COME TO A CLOSE. WE'LL TRY TO KEEP IT TO 15-20 MINUTES SO WE HAVE TIME FOR DISCUSSION AND QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS. SW WILL   BOTH PARTICIPATE IN THE Q&A SECTION AS WE GET TO THAT IN A FEW MINUTES. WE'LL START WITH THE OVERVIEW. AND THIS IS FAIRLY SIMILAR TO THE PRESENTATION THAT WE SHARED WITH YOU AT OUR LAST MEETING LAST MONTH. AGAIN, FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE PUBLIC WHO ARE HERE, THAT THE CITY WAS UPDATING ITS SIGN ORDINANCE STANDARDS TO INCLUDE SOME NEW AND INNOVATIVE STANDARDS THAT REFLECT SOME OF THE EVOLVING TRENDS IN TECHNOLOGY AS WELL AUST GENERAL UPDATES TO THE SIGN REGULATIONS. SO WE HAD QUITE AN INVOLVED PROCESS THAT HAS INCLUDED MULTIPLE DISCUSSIONS WITH STAFF, SOME BACKGROUND RESEARCH, GATHERING PUBLIC INPUT. WE CAN   TALK ABOUT THAT IN A F MINUTES. DRAFTING AND THEN REVIEWING THAT DRAFT ORDINANCE WITH YOU, THE HDC AND THE DDA. WE DID HAVE AN OPEN HOUSE, AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT IN A MINUTE, WITH ADDITIONAL REVISIONS TO THAT DRAFT LANGUAGE, AND HERE WE ARE AT THE PUBLIC HEARING ON THE FINAL DRAFT, AND   IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT --
00:04:59.258: >> I'M JUST GOING TO ADJUST YOU A LITTLE BIT SO WE CAN HEAR YOU A LITTLE BIT BETTER.
00:05:02.695: >> OH, OKAY. COOL. OH IS THAT -- OH, I CAN EVEN HEAR THE SOUND BETTER. GOOD. AND THEN IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU WILL   ALSO HAVE ANOTH HEARING AT THE CITY COUNCIL WHEN WE GET TO THAT POINT. IN TERMS OF THE PUBLIC INPUT, WE DID HAVE MULTIPLE MEETINGS. WE HAD THREE MEETINGS WITH YOU FOLKS AT THE PLANNING COMMISSION, TWO WITH THE HDC, TWO WITH THE DDA, AND WE HAD TO OPEN HOUSES. THEY WERE HELD ON THE SAME DAY. THE EARLIER ONE WAS FOR THE SIGN CONTRACTORS IN THOSE BUSINESSES AND ONE WAS OPEN TO THE PUBLIC WHICH WAS HERE IN THIS ROOM. WE ALSO HAD AN ONLINE PLATFORM THAT WE SHARED FROM OCTOBER THROUGH JULY OF 2017 THROUGH '18 THAT ALLOWED THE COMMUNITY TO SHARE IMAGES OF DIFFERENT SIGNAGE IN THE COMMUNITY, AND WE HAVE A COUPLE OF HIGHLIGHTS TO SHARE WITH YOU THERE. HERE, YOU CAN SEE THE RESULTS OF THAT. IT WAS A MAT BASED PLATFORM, AND IT ALLOWED PEOPLE, TO WHEREVER THEY WERE,■■  MAGE AND TAG IT TO A MAP. SO WE CAN SEE THAT MOST OF THE COMMENTS WERE FOCUSED ON DOWNTOWN, BUT IN THIS MAP, YOU CAN SEE THE DIFFERENT CIRCLES TO SHOW WHERE RESPONSES CAME FROM ELSEWHERE IN THE COMMUNITY, A COUPLE OF THOSE INCLUDING THE ANN ARBOR MUFFLER SIGN THAT SOMEONE MENTIONED AS BEING SOMETHING OF CHARACTER. AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE TALKED ABOUT HERE WITH YOU AS WELL AS AT THE HISTORIC DISTRICT COMMISSION AND THE DDA, THE INTEREST IN MAINTAINING SOME OF THE HISTORIC SIGNS THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE PERMITTED EVEN UNDER CURRENT SIGN STANDARDS. THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE NECESSARILY PUT INTO THE ORDINANCE AT THIS TIME, BUT WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT MANY A MINUTE AND THE STRATEGIES FOR MOVING FORWARD ON THAT. POSITIVE COMMENTS ABOUT A SMALL SCALE SIGN THAT ARE IN SCALE WITH A PROPERTY, BALANCED SIGNS ON AWNINGS, SOMETHING AS BEING ATTRACTIVE. SOME OF THE CHANGES THAT WE HAVE IN THE DRAFT ORDINANCE ITSELF, UPDATED ORGANIZATION -- IT HAS A LOGICAL FLOW TO IT, A MUCH MORE DETAILED AND FOCUSED INTENT STATEMENT. WE DO THIS TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE SHARING WITH THE COMMUNITY AND BEYOND THAT WE ARE ADDRESSING ALL OF THE ISSUES, INCLUDING PROTECTING FREE SPEECH, BUT AS WELL AS PROMOTING SAFETY, AESTHETICS, AND AS WELL PROMOTING ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND ENSURING THAT BUSINESSES AND OTHERS ARE ABLE TO SHARE THEIR MESSAGES. AN UPDATED PROHIBITED SIGN SECTION, A NEW CONSTRUCTION OF LANGUAGE SECTION THAT REALLY JUST EXPLAINS HOW WE USE WORDS IN THIS PART OF THE ORDINANCE, WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH YOUR CURRENT ORDINANCE, UPDATED GENERAL PROVISIONS, UPDATES FOR THE PERMANENT AND TEMPORARY SIGNS, AND UPDATES TO DEFINITIONS, MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE UNDERSTANDING WHAT WE ARE PUTTING INTO THE ORDINANCE. AND THEN SUBSTANTIALLY UNCHANGED ARE THE LATER ENDS OF THE ORDINANCE PERMITS, INSURANCE, AUTHORIZING SIGN ERECTORS, APPEALS AND VARIANCES AND PENALTIES AND ENFORCEMENTS. THOSE THINGS DIDN'T SEEM TO BE NEEDING TO BE TWEAKED, SO WE LEFT THEM AS THEY ARE. SOME OF THE HIGHLIGHTS INCLUDE AN UPDATE AS TO HOW WE CALCULATE SIGN AREA, UPDATING IT FROM USING ANY GEOMETRIC FORM TO FOCUSING ON SIMPLE RECTANGLES, BECAUSE IT'S BOTH EASIER TO ADMINISTRATOR, IT'S EASIER FOR USERS TO UNDERSTAND, RATHER THAN ASKING THEM TO FIGURE OUT AREAS OF CIRCLES AND TRIANGLES AND ADD THOSE ALL TOGETHER. THAT CAN BE KIND OF CUMBERSOME, SO FROM AN ENFORCEMENT STANDPOINT AS WELL, THAT IS EASIER. WE HAVE ALSO ADDED A PROVISION THAT ALLOWS FOR A BLACK BACKGROUND. WE TALKED ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT LAST TIME, AS A WAY TO MINIMIZE SOME OF THE IMPACTS OF SIGNAGE, MAKING IT STAND OUT A LITTLE BIT LESS. WE REDUCE THE PART OF THE SIGN THAT IS CALCULATED IN SIGN AREA. WE DID TALK ABOUT SIGN ILLUMINATION. I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE RECEIVED SOME COMMENTS ABOUT THAT, AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT FURTHER. WE HAD, IN AN EARLIER DRAFT, TALKED ABOUT MEASURING AMBIENT LIGHT CONDITIONS, AND WE FELT THROUGH OUR DISCUSSIONS THAT THAT SEEMED TO BE VERY CHALLENGING IN TERMS OF APPLICATION AS WELL AS REVO WE RETURNED TO THE -- CLOSER TO THE ORIGINAL LANGUAGE AT THIS TIME. FOR PERMANENT SIGNS, WE REMOVED MESSAGE UNITS. THAT SEEMED TO BE SOMETHING THAT REALLY WASN'T MAKING MUCH OF AN IMPACT ON THE SIGNS THEMSELVES AND SEEMED TO BE CUMBERSOME AND COMPLICATED AND REMOVED SOME OF THE EXCEPTIONS. WE HAD THINGS LIKE BUSINESS CENTER SIGNS ARE EXEMPT, MARQUEE SIGNS ARE EXEMPT, SO RATHER THAN HAVING THAT, WE HAVE JUST SPECIFIED THOSE IN THEIR -- BECAUSE THEY WERE REALL CONTENT OF THOSE SIGNS. WE WANTED TO GET RID OF THAT. OVERALL, THE SIGN STANDARDS, PARTICULARLY FOR PERMANENT WALL AND FREE-STANDING SIGNS HAVEN'T CHANGED IN TERMS OF WHAT USERS ARE ALLOWED TO HAVE, SO TWO SQUARE FEET PER LINEAR FOOT OF GROUND FLOOR FRONTAGE, UP TO 200 SQUARE FEET, IS WHAT YOU CURRENTLY PERMIT FOR WALL AND GROUND OR FREE STANDING SIGNS. THEATERS WERE ALLOWED UP TO 200 SQUARE FEET OF CHANGEABLE MESSAGE SIGNAGE. IN THE NEW ORDINANCE, WE DEFINE MARQUEE AND INCLUDE THAT FOR SIGNAGE IN ALL PLACES OF ASSEMBLY, AND IT'S NOT EXACTLY A BONUS ANYMORE DUE TO THE EXPANSION OF USES THAT WE HAVE ADAPTED FOR THAT, BUT THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH BEING -- PROMOTING THE SAME TYPES OF PROVISIONS FOR SIMILAR PLACES OF ASSEMBLY, LIKE THEATERS, PLACES OF WORSHIP AND THE LIKE. FOR RESIDENTIAL SIGNS, UP TO THREE SQUARE FEET FOR ONE AND TWO FAMILY HOMES, UP TO 12 SQUARE FEET FOR MULTIPLE FAMILY. THOSE ARE SPECIFICALLY IN THE ORDINANCE NOW FOR NAMES AND ADDRESSES OF RESIDENCES. WE REMOVED THE DESCRIPTION OF THE CONTENT OF THE SIGN, BUT THOSE STANDARDS REMAIN. WE ADDED SOME STANDARDS FOR SPECIFIC SIGNS, PROJECTED AND HANGING SIGNS, ALLEY SIGNS, CANOPY SIGNS. YOU DID ALLOW THEM, BUT IT WASN'T REALLY CLEAR FROM THE EXISTING LANGUAGE HOW THOSE WERE TO BE ADDRESSED, SO WE HAVE INCLUDED THAT IN THERE WITH SOME GRAPHICS. FOR CHANGEABLE MESSAGE SIGNS, WE HAVE MAINTAINED THAT THE CHANGEABLE PORTION OF THE SIGN IS A MAXIMUM OF 50% AND MAINTAINED THAT A CHANGE OF A COPY CAN CHANGE ONCE EVERY 15 MINUTES. YOU'LL RECALL THAT WE DID DOES THAT AT OUR LAST MEETING, WHETHER THE TIME FRAME WAS TOO LONG, WHETHER IT WAS TOO SHORT, AND REALLY I THINK IT ENDED UP THAT IT DIDN'T SEEM TO BE A PROBLEM, SO WE HAVE KEPT IT AT THAT. MAINTAINING SOME OF THE STANDARDS, BUT MAKING IT MORE CLEAR THAT THE STANDARDS FOR ILLUMINATION DO REFLECT ON ELECTRONIC MESSAGE SIGNS. FOR INTERIOR SIGNS, WINDOW SIGNS, WE MAINTAIN THE LIMIT OF 25% OF THE TOTAL WINDOW AREA. THE NEW ORDINANCE PERMITS ADDITIONAL APPLIED LETTERING IN THE LOWER EIGHT INCHES OF ANY GROUND FLOOR WINDOW, UP TO 80% OF THE WINDOW WIDTH, AS A LITTLE BIT OF A BONUSEN TO PERMIT SOME HIGHER QUALITY PERMANENT SIGNAGE IN THE WINDOWS. TEMPORARY SIGNS IS WHERE WE MADE SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES, AND THAT'S DUE TO THE CASE OF REID VERSUS THE TOWN OF GILBERT, WHICH REALLY SUGGESTED THAT CONTENT BASED STANDARDS WERE NOT THE WAY TO GO ANYMORE, SO WE WANTED TO TRY TO GET RID OF THAT, SO CONTENT-BASED SIGNS WERE THINGS WHERE WE SPECIFICALLY CALLED THEM OUT IN THE ORDINANCE AS A REAL ESTATE SIGN, A CONTRACTOR SIGN, A POLITICAL SIGN, AN OPEN HOUSE SIGN. INSTEAD, WE COVER ALL TEMPORARY TYPES OF SIGNS THE SAME WAY. THIS CHART MAY BE A LITTLE BIT HARD TO READ, BUT I WANTED TO TRY TO STICK INTO THIS SOME OF THE CURRENT STANDARDS. IT MAY BE HELPFUL, AND WE CAN GO BACK TO THIS IF WE NEED TO WHEN WE HAVE QUESTIONS AND IN THE Q&A SECTION, BUT I WANTED TO SHARE FOR THE RESIDENTIAL WALL AND FREE STANDING SIGNS WHAT THE CURRENT ORDINANCE ALLOWS, AND THEN FOR THE NEW FORMULA THAT WE HAVE FOR THAT TEMPORARY SIGNAGE FOR RESIDENTIAL AND NONRESIDENTIAL. SO, CURRENTLY, THE ORDINANCE SAYS THAT REAL ESTATE SIGNS, FOR SALE, FOR RENT, OR CONTRACTOR SIGNS CAN BE TEN AND A HALF SQUARE FEET, AND POLITICAL SIGNS CAN ALSO BE TEN AND A HALF SQUARE FEET, AND THERE'S A FURTHER BREAKDOWN IN POLITICAL SIGNS RELATED TO AN ELECTION. IT DOESN'T HAVE A BEGINNING DATE FOR THEM, BUT THEY ALL HAVE TO BE TAKEN DOWN 18 HOURS AFTER THE ELECTION, AND THEN IF IT'S NOT RELATED TO AN ELECTION, THERE IS NO TIME LIMIT, AND THERE IS NO QUANTITY LIMIT EITHER. SO THE NEW ORDINANCE SAYS THAT .2 SQUARE FEET OF SIGN AREA PER LINEAR FOOT OF STREET FRONTAGE, PROVIDED THAT THE MAXIMUM TOTAL AREA IS NOT MORE THAN 15 SQUARE FEET OR LESS THAN 15 SQUARE FEET OR MORE THAN 45 OR 48 SQUARE FEET, WITH THE MAXIMUM SIZE OF ANY ONE SIGN OF 12 SQUARE FEET, AND THAT IS FOR RESIDENTIAL USES. THE WALL SIGNS, THESE WOULD BE IN ADDITION TO THE THREE SQUARE FEET THAT ARE PERMITTED AS A PERMANENT SIGN, AND THOSE WOULD BE LOCATED WITHIN FOUR FEET OF THE FRONT DOOR, BUT THESE WOULD BE ADDITIONAL BANNER TYPE SIGNS FOR MAYBE IN A RESIDENTIAL AREA, YOU MIGHT HAVE A GRADUATION ANNOUNCEMENT OR A BIRTH ANNOUNCEMENT, AND THERE MIGHT BE A LITTLE BANNER THAT YOU HAVE UP, AND THAT'S FOR A SPECIFIED PERIOD OF TIME. SIMILAR TO THE KINDS OF WALL SIGNS, BANNER SIGNS THAT YOU WOULD SEE IN A COMMERCIAL AREA, AND SO YOU CAN SEE IN THAT CHART, THEN,   HOW THAT BREAKS OUT, AND WE CAN ALWAYS COME BACK TO THAT IF THERE'S ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS ON THIS. WE WANTED TO SHOW A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES. THIS IS A ONE-FAMILY DWELLING ON A 45-FOOT WIDE THESE ARE VERY APPROXIMATE TOO. WE DIDN'T GO OUT TO MEASURE THE HOUSE TO DO THESE THINGS, BUT JUST TO GIVE PEOPLE AN IDEA. THE LITTLE YELLOW WINDOW SIGN UP ON TOP CAN BE EITHER ON THE FIRST OR SECOND FLOOR, AND THAT'S THREE SQUARE FEET, AND THEN THE THREE SQUARE FEET PERMANENT SIGN IN FRONT OF THE FRONT DOOR, THIS ONE ACTUALLY HAS SUCH A SIGN, AND I OUTLINED IT. A LITTLE TEMPORARY WALL SIGN, MAXIMUM SIZE FOR ONE SIGN IS THREE SQUARE FEET, AND THEN THE TEMPORARY FREE STANDING SIGNS, WITH 45 LINEAR FEET OF FRONTAGE, WITH THAT FORMULA, IT IS NINE FEET, BUT WE HAVE SAID 12 SQUARE FEET IS THE MAXIMUM, SO THEY COULD DO AN ADDITIONAL SIGN THAT IS SIX OR THEY COULD BREAK IT UP HOWEVER THEY WANTED TO. ANOTHER INSTANCE, THIS IS ON A WIDER LOT. IT'S ACTUALLY A TWO-FAMILY DWELLING, AND YOU CAN JUST SEE THAT THAT BREAKS OUT A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY IN TERMS OF TWO UPPER FLOOR WINDOW SIGNS, AND THEN THE THREE SQUARE FOOT NEAR THE FRONT DOOR, AND THEN A TEMPORARY WALL SIGN, AND THEN 18 SQUARE FEET OF TEMPORARY SIGNAGE BECAUSE OF THE LARGER SIZE OF THE LOT, AND I ENDED UP PUTTING THEM BOTH ON THE PROPERTY ON THE RIGHT, BECAUSE THERE WAS A LITTLE PICKET FENCE IN THE FRONT, SO I COULDN'T REALLY SHOW THAT, BUT THAT WAS INTENDED TO BE ONE LARGE LOT. THAT PROBABLY WASN'T THE BEST EXAMPLE, BUT THAT WAS REALLY WHAT WE HAD FOR OUR PRESENTATION, AND WE CAN GO BACK TO ANY OF THOSE SLIDES, AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE.
00:16:26.755: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  THANK YOU. WE'LL NOW HEAD OVER TO MR. CHENG FOR A STAFF REPORT. IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO ADD?
00:16:32.127: >> THERE'S NOT MUCH FOR THE STAFF REPORT. WE HAVE RECOMMENDED APPROVAL, AND I'M HERE FOR ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE.
00:16:39.201: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  ALL RIGHT THE AT THIS TIME, WE WILL OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING ON THIS ISSUE. IS THERE ANYONE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION FOR THIS ITEM?
00:16:49.778: >> I LIVE AT 506 EAST  KINGSLEY AND I WOULD LIKE TO THANK SCOTT AND JULIE FOR YOUR SERVICE. I HAVE NOT ALWAYS AGREED WITH YOUR POSITIONS, BUT I SO RESPECT ALL OF THE TIME THAT YOU HAVE PUT IN AND YOUR INTELLIGENT ANALYSIS. SO, THANK YOU. I DID SEND YOU ALL AN EMAIL IN REGARDS TO SOME POSITIVE POINTS AND NEGATIVE POINTS IN REGARDS TO THE SIGN ORDINANCE, BUT I DON'T WANT TO REPEAT THAT, AND INSTEAD I WOULD LIKE TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MY OBSERVATIONS OF THE PROCESS. MY FIRST EXPERIENCE WITH THIS PROCESS STARTED IN OCTOBER OF 2016, WHERE THERE WERE SOME INITIAL CONVERSATIONS IN REGARDS TO PLANNING AND GETTING A CONSULTANT, AND THEN GIFFOLS WEBSTER WAS HIRED IN 2017 AND I THOUGHT DID A REALLY GOOD JOB OF GETTING INPUT. I, UNFORTUNATELY, WAS ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE WHO SHOWED UP TO PROVIDE INPUT ON THE SIGNS, AND I'LL TALK ABOUT THAT IN A LITTLE BIT, BUT I APPRECIATED THAT, AND A GREAT DEAL OF TIME WAS SPENT IN GETTING PUBLIC INPUT IN MULTIPLE WAYS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SIGN ORDINANCE. MY CONCERN IS THAT THE TIME FOR PUBLIC REVIEW, ONCE THE STAFF REPORT AND THE ORDINANCE RECOMMENDATIONS CAME IN, WAS REALLY SHORT, AND PART OF THE PROBLEM WAS, I THINK IN TERMS OF HOW WE ARE ENGAGED IN THAT. NOW, I KNOW THE LEGAL REQUIREMENT IS WE POST THIS ON THE WASHTENAW LEGAL NEWS, SO I WENT ON TO WASHTENAW LEGAL NEWS TODAY AND TRIED TO FIND THE ORDINANCE, AND I COULDN'T. APPARENTLY, YOU NEED TO PAY $80 A YEAR TO GET A FULL SUBSCRIPTION TO GET COMPLETE ACCESS TO IT, SO I DON'T REALLY THINK THAT OUTLET IS AN AUTHENTIC WAY OF GETTING CITIZEN INPUT. AND THEN THE PROBLEM, I DID CONNECT WITH SOME OF YOUR STAFF WHO WERE VERY FORTHCOMING AND HELPFUL, BUT THEN I FOUND OUT JUST ABOUT A WEEK OR SO AGO THAT THE PUBLIC HEARING WAS TODAY. BUT OF REAL CONCERN WAS THAT THE STAFF REPORT WAS NOT GOING TO BE RELEASED UNTIL FRIDAY. SO, HERE WE HAVE A PERIOD OF INPUT THAT WENT ON FOR A YEAR AND A HALF TO PROVIDE INPUT INTO THE DRAFTING OF THE ORDINANCE, BUT WHEN IT CAME TIME FOR THE PUBLIC TO REVIEW THE EXISTING ORDINANCE AND THEN TRY TO GET QUESTIONS FROM THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT, WELL, IT WAS RELEASED ON A FRIDAY. THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT IS OFF ON THE WEEKEND. I ATTEMPTED TO WRITE SOME EMAILS, WHICH THEY DID RESPOND TO, ACTUALLY, ON THREE DIFFERENT TIMES OVER THE WEEKEND AND INTO THIS MORNING FOR -- AND I'M GREATLY APPRECIATIVE OF THAT, BUT I CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THIS ORDINANCE IS COMPLICATED, AND WHEN I STARTED TO ASK SPECIFICS QUESTIONS, I REALIZED I JUST COULDN'T GET ENOUGH DETAIL IN THE ANSWERS, AND I STILL LEFT CONFUSED. BUT I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN IMPROVE THE PROCESS OF ENGAGEMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET MORE AUTHENTIC INPUT. THANK YOU.
00:20:00.933: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION IN REGARDS TO THIS ITEM?
00:20:13.445: >> HELLO. MY NAME IS RYAN FARBER. I LIVE ON 540 THOMPSON STREET, AND I THINK THIS WAS INTRODUCED AS AN ANSWER OR A QUESTION AND ANSWER PART, SO I HOPE THAT IT'S OKAY THAT I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS THAT I WAS WONDERING ABOUT. SO, THE FIRST ONE IS -- WELL, THEY ARE BOTH RELATED TO HOW THIS DRAFT HAS CHANGED RELATIVE TO AN EARLIER VERSION. THE APRIL 16TH VERSION HAD A LOT OF MARKUPS FROM THE -- SOME INPUT FROM LIGHTING CONCERNS, SO ONE PART WAS CHANGING THE LANGUAGE TO MENTION THAT LIGHTS SHOULD BE FULLY CUT OFF SO THAT YOU AVOID GLARE AS WELL AS LIGHT POLLUTION IN THE SKY, SO I WAS JUST WONDERING IF THAT MODIFICATION WAS INCLUDED OR NOT, BECAUSE I COULDN'T TELL, SO THAT'S QUESTION NUMBER ONE.
00:21:07.499: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  AND DURING OUR DISCUS  ON, I AM SURE SOMEBODY WILL ASK THAT QUESTION OF OUR CONSULTANTS, SO, GO AHEAD WITH QUESTION NUMBER TWO.
00:21:15.507: >> OKAY. SO QUESTION NUMBER TWO WAS RELATED TO THE CHANGE ABOUT THE AMBIENT LIGHTING. I WAS JUST -- SO I UNDERSTAND THAT MAYBE THAT'S A LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH TO  ADJUST THE LIGHTING, I GUESS, CLEANLY FROM DAYLIGHT TO NIGHTTIME, BUT I WAS WONDERING IF THE LANGUAGE IS STILL PRESERVED IN THE SIGN ORDINANCE THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE A -- NOT EXCEED A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF LIGHT DURING THE DAY, VERSUS A LOWER AMOUNT AT NIGHT, SO YOU DON'T NEED A LIGHT -- YOU DON'T NEED TO ILLUMINATE THE SIGN AS BRIGHT AT NIGHT AS DURING THE DAY, SO THAT WAS QUESTION NUMBER TWO.
00:21:55.380: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU. I AM SURE WE'LL GET TO IT DURING OUR DISCUSSION. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION IN REGARDS TO THIS ITEM? ALL RIGHT. SEEING NO ONE, I'LL CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEERG -- PUBLIC HEARING AND MOVE ON WITH READING THE MOTION. THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION HEREBY RECOMMENDS THAT THE MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL APPROVE THE AMENDMENTS TO CHAPTER 55 UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE SECTION 5.24, MOVED BY COMMISSIONER WOODS, SECOND BY COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN. WE ARE IN DISCUSSION. COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN?
00:22:30.882: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN:  THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR. I'LL SAVE SUBSTANTIVE QUESTIONS FOR A LITTLE WHILE, BUT THE WASHTENAW LEGAL NEWS, I'LL BE HONEST, I HAVE NEVER ACTUALLY ACCESSED ORDINANCE THROUGH IT. DO YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR A SUBSCRIPTION, AND ALSO, WHAT IS THE REQUIREMENT THAT IT BE PUBLISHED THERE? IS THAT THE ZONING ENABLING ACT?
00:22:54.806: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  NO, IT'S CITY COUNCIL DECLARES IT TO BE THE CITY'S OFFICIAL PAPER OF RECORD.
00:22:59.511: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN: INTERESTING. AND SO THAT WOULD BE UP TO CITY COUNCIL TO CHANGE VIA ORDINANCE?
00:23:04.682: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  YEAH, THE CITY COUNCIL DOES DESIGNATE A PAPER TO BE THE PAPER OF RECORD. THERE ARE TIMES DUE TO PUBLICATION RESTRICTIONS THAT ANOTHER PAPER MIGHT BE USED, BUT GENERALLY THAT IS -- THAT HAS BEEN DEEMED TO BE THE PAPER OF RECORD.
00:23:22.333: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN:  DO YOU KNOW HOW OLD THAT LAW IS?
00:23:27.605: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  I WOULD IMAGINE ABOUT THE TIME THAT THE ANN ARBOR NEWS STOPPED PUBLISHING ON A DAILY BASIS.
00:23:32.276: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN: UNDERSTOOD. OKAY. THANK YOU.
00:23:36.581: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN: COMMISSIONER BRIGGS?
00:23:39.050: >> COMISSIONER BRIGGS:  YEAH. SO, IF YOU COULD KIND OF GO THROUGH -- I KNOW THAT THERE WERE A NUMBER OF RECOMMENDATIONS WITH REGARDS TO LIGHTING, THAT ONE OF THE SPEAKERS SPOKE TO, BUT THAT ALSO GOT BROUGHT UP DURING THE WORKING SESSION. I WAS WONDERING KIND OF THE REASONING ABOUT NOT INCORPORATING A LOT OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS INTO THE FINAL DRAFT, KIND OF ADDRESSING SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THE SPEAKER BROUGHT UP, IF YOU COULD JUST KIND OF GO THROUGH THOSE, THAT REASONING, THAT WOULD GREAT.
00:24:07.244: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  WELL, I'LL KICK IT OFF. I THINK THAT WE FORESAW SOME CHALLENGES WITH SOME OF THE APPLICATION OF SOME OF THE MEASUREMENT THAT WOULD BE SIMILAR FOR DARK SKIES LIGHTING AS IT WOULD BE FOR SIGNAGE. IN SOME CASES, FOR EXAMPLE, MEASUREMENTS OF CERTAIN TYPES OF SIGNS ARE VERY EASY TO ASCERTAIN, THEY ARE EASY TO PROGRAM, THEY ARE EASY TO MEASURE AND VALIDATE. USING THOSE SAME MEASUREMENTS MIGHT NOT APPLY UNIFORMLY TO A SIGN THAT IS, FOR LACK OF A BETTER TERM, MORE HISTORIC, THAT MAY RELY ON A MORE TRADITIONAL BACK LIT LIGHTING SOURCE OR SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT, AND SO TRY TO FIND THE RIGHT WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN MEASURE, WE KNOW HOW TO MEASURE FOOT CANDLES, FOR EXAMPLE. FOR ELECTRONIC SIGNS, WE CAN VALIDATE THAT AN ELECTRONIC MESSAGING SIGN IS SET TO THE APPROPRIATE NUMBER OF NITS OR LUMENS, POTENTIALLY. NOT ALL SIGNAGE GIVES US THE ABILITY TO HAVE THAT VERIFICATION. SO OUR INITIAL THOUGHT WAS TO PROCEED WITH THE SIGN ORDINANCE AS IT IS DRAFTED, AND AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH ANY SORT OF LIGHTING ORDINANCE, IT MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE TO REVISIT THAT AS PART OF THAT, BUT TO BE SURE, WE HAD SOME INTERNAL DISCUSSION ON THAT, BECAUSE I RECOGNIZE THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT THE LIGHTING ORDINANCE CONCURRENTLY AS WELL. I DON'T FEEL LIKE IT'S THAT FAR BEHIND, BUT, AGAIN, SOME OF THE STANDARDS I THINK ARE MORE DIFFICULT TO APPLY TO MEASURING SIGNAGE THAN THEY ARE TO OTHER TYPES OF LIGHTING FIXTURES, SO, IN SHORT, THAT'S AN OVERVIEW.
00:25:52.083: >> OKAY. THERE'S ONE KIND OF SIMPLE EDIT THAT WAS MADE ON PAGE 9, UNDER GLARE -- PART B, SIGN ILLUMINATION, NUMBER THREE, GLARE. ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM SALLY HAD BEEN TO SWITCH FROM SAYING THAT GLARE CONTROL FOR SIGN LIGHTING SHALL BE ACHIEVED THROUGH THE USE OF FULLY SHIELDED FIXTURES. BUT IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THAT EDIT WAS INCORPORATED, AND I WASN'T SURE -- IT CURRENTLY SAYS FULL CUTOFF FIXTURES, SHIELDS AND -- I DON'T KNOW IF THERE WAS SORT OF A REASON BEHIND THAT OR IF THERE WAS A PIECE THAT WAS SORT OF MISSED OR JUST THOUGHTS AROUND THAT.
00:26:38.730: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  I GUESS I WOULD LEAVE IT UP TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION'S DISCUSSIONS. I THINK ONE OF THE POTENTIAL CHALLENGES OF FULL CUTOFF FIXTURES FOR SIGNAGE IS THE DIRECTION OF THEM. I THINK IT'S PRETTY CLEAR WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A DOWN LIT CIRCUMSTANCE, BUT WE ARE PROVIDING SOME CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO, FOR EXAMPLE, HAVE A RELATIVELY SMALL FIXTURE POINTING BACK AT A SIGN. WE WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT THAT CUTOFF, OBVIOUSLY, FROM MAYBE JUST KIND OF A TYPICAL, MAYBE PARALLEL DIRECTION OR SOMETHING, BUT THAT'S DEFINITELY WHY WE ARE HERE, IS TO PRESENT THIS DRAFT, IF THAT'S A CHANGE THAT THE PLANNING COMMISSION WOULD LIKE TO SEE. WE CAN LOOK AT THOSE TWEAKS.
00:27:19.203: >> OKAY. AND THEN JUST A FEW OTHER PIECES THAT I NOTICED THAT WEREN'T INCORPORATED, THAT WEREN'T INVOLVED IN TERMS OF MEASUREMENT. THERE'S THE PIECE, NUMBER EIGHT, REGARDLESS OF ANY OTHER REQUIREMENT, ALL ILLUMINATED SIGNS SHALL NOT EXCEED ONE FOOT CANDLES -- BUT IT'S ALL R DISTRICTS. WE DON'T DEAL WITH ANY OTHER SORTS OF DISTRICTS THAT THIS MIGHT BE IMPACTING, SO I'M JUST KIND OF CURIOUS AROUND THAT STANDARD AS WELL.
00:27:57.275: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  SO YOUR GOAL WOULD BE TO ADD THAT TO COMMERCIAL TO COMMERCIAL AS WELL?
00:28:04.115: >> COMMISSIONER BRIGGS:  YEAH, I MEAN ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS WAS TO DISCUSS, WE NOTICED WHEN WE WENT OUT FOR THE LIGHTING ORDINANCE COMMITTEE THAT, EXCEPT FOR IN THE D1 AND D2 DISTRICTS, WHERE THERE WAS A LOT MORE SORT OF LIGHT TRESPASS ACROSS BOUNDARY LINES, AND IT WAS REALLY HARD -- IT WOULD HAVE BEEN CLOSE TO IMPOSSIBLE TO ENFORCE AROUND THAT, THAT IN PRETTY MUCH EVERY OTHER COMMERCIAL CORRIDOR, WE WEREN'T SEEING THAT SORT OF LIGHT TRESPASS, AND IF YOU WERE, THAT WOULD BE PRETTY EGREGIOUS, SO JUST SOMETHING FOR US TO, I THINK, BE CONSIDERING, THAT THERE'S MAYBE A DIFFERENT NATURE FOR THE DOWNTOWN THAN THE REST OF THE OTHER DISTRICTS. AND THEN YOU MIGHT HAVE SOME THOUGHTS ON LIGHTING TOO, BUT NOT RELATED TO LIGHTING AT THIS MOMENT. THIS IS SORT OF RANDOM. I NOTICED THAT ON PAGE 19, WHEN IT DISCUSSES BILLBOARDS, THEY ARE -- I DON'T KNOW IF THIS WAS PLANNED TO BE FILLED IN AT SOME POINT. IT SAYS -- BASICALLY, IT LOOKS LIKE A DATE SHOULD BE ADDED IN THERE, BILLBOARDS LAWFULLY EXISTING AS OF BLANK 2019. I DON'T KNOW IF WE WANTED TO ESTABLISH THAT DATE AS TODAY, OR --
00:29:17.688: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  YEAH, THAT WOULD BE THE ADOPTION DATE OF THE ORDINANCE.
00:29:23.293: >> COMISSIONER BRIGGS:  OKAY. I WASN'T QUITE SURE HOW THAT WOULD GET INCORPORATED IN.
00:29:28.866: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? COMMISSIONER MILLS.
00:29:30.801: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  I'LL JUST FOLLOW UP ON THIS. I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT I'M READING THIS RIGHT. THERE WAS A QUESTION ABOUT ILLUMINATION OF DAY VERSUS NIGHT. AND I SEE THAT FOR THE ELECTRONIC SIGNS. IS THAT RIGHT? SO THERE IS A MAXIMIZE OF 5,000 NITS DURING THE DAY, AND THEN A HUNDRED NITS IS THE MAXIMUM BETWEEN DAWN AND DUSK, SO I WANTED TO NOTE THAT. AND ALSO I WANTED TO NOTE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I DON'T THINK WAS IN THE LAST DRAFT THAT WE TALKED ABOUT, AND I APPRECIATE YOU PUTTING IT IN THERE, WAS THE CURFEW, AND THE IDEA WHAT THIS IS CALLING FOR IS NOW WHETHER IT IS AN ELECTRONIC SIGN OR AN ILLUMINATED SIGN OR JUST A PLAIN SIGN -- WELL, AN ILLUMINATED SIGN, LIKE A LIGHT BULB ON A SIGN, NOT INTERNALLY ILLUMINATED, THAT IT WOULD CLOSE -- OR TURN OFF AN HOUR AFTER CLOSING TIME, OR 10:00, I THINK, ESSENTIALLY, SO I APPRECIATE THAT. I THINK, AGAIN, THE GOAL BEHIND ALL OF OUR LIGHTING ORDINANCE STUFF IS TO HELP SAVE ENERGY AS WELL AS TO, YOU KNOW, ELIMINATE SOME LIGHT POLLUTION, AND SO THIS IS INCREMENTAL STEPS TOWARDS THAT, SO I APPRECIATE THAT. ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT HAS COME UP IN MY FAMILY AS WE GO AROUND TOWN AND I THINK ABOUT WHAT THE IMPLICATIONS ARE OF THE SIGN ORDINANCE, AND MAYBE THIS GETS TO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT YOUR KIND OF PINGING US ABOUT THESE ICONIC SIGNS IN TOWN, I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT THAT, BUT HOW DO CLOCKS FIT INTO THIS? SO CLOCKS THAT ARE PART OF PEOPLE'S SIGNAGE, BECAUSE THAT'S ACTUALLY -- MY HUSBAND IS VERY CONCERNED THAT WE ARE NOT GOING TO ALLOW CLOCKS, AND THAT'S A GOOD SERVICE TO THE COMMUNITY. SO HOW DO YOU COUNT THAT? I DON'T SEE ANY REFERENCE TO IT RIGHT NOW, AND SO HOW DO WE ENFORCE THAT?
00:31:16.840: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  IF YOU CAN COME UP TO THE PODIUM.
00:31:22.212: >> I THINK THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE HANDLED ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS, IN TERMS OF ITS -- IF IT'S PART OF THE SIGN, IF IT MEETS THE DEFINITION OF THE SIGN. I DON'T KNOW. I THINK YOU PROBABLY -- HOWEVER YOU HANDLED THAT UP TO THIS POINT.
00:31:37.995: >> PLANNING MANAGER: PREVIOUSLY, IF IT'S NOT ADVERTISING, I DID NOT LOOK AT IT AS PART OF THE SIGNAGE, SO IF IT'S NOT ADVERTISING A PRODUCT, I WOULD LOOK AT IT, GO TO THE BUILDING DEPARTMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S NOT UNSAFE, NOT OVERHANGING A CERTAIN DISTANCE.
00:31:56.580: >> SO THE SHINOLA CLOCK IS NOT SIGNAGE. I'M TRYING TO THINK, IS IT BANK OF AMERICA?
00:32:08.258: >> ARBORLAND.
00:32:10.160: >> THERE'S SOME ON SOUTH STATE. I'M JUST CURIOUS, AT A STORAGE PLACE OR SOMETHING -- THIS IS TERRIBLE THAT I DON'T KNOW WHAT BUSINESSES, SO IT'S NOT REALLY ADVERTISING. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M JUST CURIOUS ABOUT THAT, BECAUSE THIS IS WHEN WE HAD A DISCUSSION ABOUT THE IDEA THAT ELECTRONIC THINGS CAN ONLY CHANGE EVERY 15 MINUTES. DOES THAT MEAN THAT WE CAN'T DO ELECTRONIC CLOCKS? SO I JUST BRING THAT UP. I DON'T THINK WE TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE, BUT WE SHOULD. THIS IS COMMONLY INCORPORATED -- NOT SUPER COMMON, BUT OCCASIONALLY INCORPORATED, AT LEAST.
00:32:40.991: >> UH-HUH. IT'S A GOOD QUESTION. IT'S PROBABLY SIMILAR TO IN THE WAY THAT WE LOOK AT MURALS. WE -- IT CAN BE DIFFICULT. WE HAVE TO MAKE INTERPRETATIONS WHEN WE ARE INTERPRETING THE ORDINANCE AS TO WHETHER OR NOT SOMETHING IS A SIGNAGE RELATIVE TO THE BUSINESS OR TRULY ADVERTISING. THERE'S SOME OF THE EXAMPLES THAT YOU GAVE, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT A SHINOLA CLOCK, I MIGHT LOOK AT THAT DIFFERENTLY AS SIGNAGE. THAT SEEMS TO BE VERY MUCH ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE BUSINESS THAT THEY CONDUCT AT THAT LOCATION, INTENDED PROBABLY IN SOME WAYS TO COMMUNICATE THAT, WHEREAS THE CLOCK AT ARBORLAND I THINK IS PROBABLY LESS PARTICULAR TO THE BUSINESS BEING TRANSACTED AT THAT LOCATION, SO IT'S A GOOD QUESTION. WE COULD SEEK TO QUALIFY -- YOU KNOW, TO SOMEHOW ADDRESS IT MORE SPECIFICALLY. MY INITIAL THOUGHT IS THAT'S PROBABLY HOW I WOULD LOOK AT IT, IS SIMILARLY IF YOU HAD A BREWERY, AND YOU WANTED TO PAINT A MURAL OF PEOPLE DRINKING BEER ON A PATIO, I WOULD PROBABLY LOOK AT THAT DIFFERENTLY THAN A CITYSCAPE OR A MURAL OF KIDS PLAYING IN A PARK. IT'S NOT -- IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S RELATIVELY HARD TO DEFINE, POTENTIALLY, IN THE ORDINANCE, BUT WE DO HAVE TO MAKE SOME OF THOSE INTERPRETATIONS AT TIMES, WHETHER IT IS SIGNAGE RELATIVE TO THE BUSINESS OR NOT.
00:34:14.184: >> GOT IT. SO IF SOMEBODY WANTS TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND STAFF IS SAYING IT'S SIGNAGE?
00:34:21.725: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  THEY COULD DO IT, AS LONG AS IT'S ONE OF THE APPROVED CATEGORIES AND IT'S WITHIN THE SQUARE FOOTAGE ALLOWED.
00:34:27.397: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  GOT IT. DOES IT RULE OUT DIGITAL CLOCKS NOW, TOO, BECAUSE OF THE CHANGING -- LIKE, IS THAT HOW YOU WOULD?
00:34:33.770: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.
00:34:34.971: >> IT IS. AND IF IT'S THE PORTION, YOU CAN HAVE UP TO 50% OF THE SIGN BE ELECTRONIC.
00:34:43.313: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  BUT TECHNICALLY THE TIME CAN'T CHANGE MORE THAN ONCE EVERY 15 MINUTES.
00:34:51.188: >> RIGHT, AND WE DON'T EXEMPT TIME/TEMPERATURE FOR THOSE REASONS, THAT WE DON'T WANT TO SAY WE ALLOW -- YOU KNOW, THIS IS WHAT WE ALLOW, EXCEPT FOR THIS, THIS, THIS AND THIS, BECAUSE THEN YOU'RE STARTING TO SAY WHY THOSE THINGS AND WHY NOT OTHER THINGS.
00:35:05.802: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  NOT BE CONTENT NEUTRAL.
00:35:07.237: >> DID YOU HAVE A FOLLOW-UP ON THAT? OH, GOOD.
00:35:11.407: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  SO DOES THAT MEAN THAT DIGITAL CLOCKS ARE GOING AWAY? BECAUSE WE ARE NOT THE ONLY PLACES THAT ARE UPDATING OUR SIGN ORDINANCES IN KEEPING WITH THIS, SO YOU HAVE TO BE CONTENT NEUTRAL OR YOU HAVE TO BE ALLOWED TO CHANGE EVERY MINUTE, ONCE A MINUTE, OR DIGITAL SIGNS, GENERALLY SPEAKING AGAIN, TO BE CONTENT NEUTRAL AND IN KEEPING WITH THE LAW, LIKE DIGITAL CLOCKS ARE GOING AWAY.
00:35:34.397: >> WELL, DIGITAL CLOCKS AREN'T GOING AWAY. IF THEY ARE LEGALLY CONFORMING SIGNS RIGHT NOW, THEY WILL REMAIN.
00:35:51.781: >> TO YOUR POINT, IT COULDN'T CHANGE FAST ENOUGH.
00:35:55.918: >> SO THAT MAY BE SOMETHING TO CONSIDER IN THINKING ABOUT THAT.
00:36:01.223: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  THE BIGGER QUESTION IS WOULD YOU LIKE MORE CLOCKS, AND IF SO, THAT MIGHT OPEN THE DOOR TO OTHER DIGITAL MESSAGING CHANGING. THAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT THE SUPREME COURT DECISION SAYS, IS THAT WE AS A COMMUNITY HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT BEING TASTE MAKERS WHEN IT COMES TO WHAT THINGS ARE ALLOWED AND WHAT THINGS AREN'T, AND SO WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO HERE IS TO SAY THAT OUR EXPERIENCE IN THE COMMUNITY GENERALLY IS, IF IT'S AN ELECTRONIC MESSAGING, IT CAN BE NO MORE THAN 50% AND IT CAN'T CHANGE MORE THAN EVERY 15 MINUTES, AND THAT APPLIES TO WHATEVER YOU PUT IN THE SPACE.
00:36:39.829: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  SO I DON'T WANT TO BE THE PERSON TO CHOOSE, BUT I POINTED OUT THAT RIGHT NOW WE COULDN'T BUILD ANOTHER DIGITAL CLOCK AS DRAFTED, SO I THINK I WOULD PUT IT TO THE COMMISSION THAT IF SOMEBODY DOES WANT TO SEE MORE DIGITAL CLOCKS, BECAUSE I CAN SEE BOTH SIDES --
00:36:59.716: >> WE ALL HAVE IT ON OUR PHONES [ LAUGHTER ].
00:37:04.053: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  THIS IS COMING FROM SOMEBODY WHO DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE A SMART PHONE.
00:37:10.192: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  NOT YET.
00:37:10.860: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  SO WHAT DO WE DO WHEN WE IDENTIFY EXISTING SIGNS OR THESE ICONIC SIGNS THAT WE LIKE? BUT THAT DON'T NECESSARILY FIT WITH THIS EXISTING ORDINANCE.
00:37:21.571: >> RIGHT, AND THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WE WERE SUGGESTING YOU MAY LOOK AT AFTER THIS PROCESS IS COMPLETE, THAT IT WOULD MAYBE FALL OUTSIDE OF THE SIGN ORDINANCE, BUT THAT YOU WOULD ALLOW FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF NON CONFORMING SIGNS AND LET THOSE BE SOMETHING THAT A CITY IDENTIFIES OR A PROPERTY OWNER IDENTIFIES. MAYBE SOMEBODY WOULD NOMINATE THE ARBORLAND SIGN AS BEING HISTORIC, AND IF IT IS DEEMED THAT WAY, AND, YOU KNOW, LIKELY THAT MIGHT GO THROUGH THE HDC. THAT SEEMS LIKE THE LOGICAL PLACE FOR THAT TO GO, PERHAPS, BUT THEN ALLOWING THAT TO FALL INTO SOME KIND OF PROTECTED NONCONFORMING STATUS, WHERE IT IS ALLOWED TO BE MAINTAINED. IT IS ALLOWED TO BE MAINTAINED AT THIS POINT, JUST NOT EXPANDED. BUT IF THERE WERE SOME LIGHTNING STRIKE IN MORE THAN WHATEVER IT IS, 50 OR 75% TO BE DAMAGED, TO ALLOW THAT TO BE REBUILT, AND IF IT'S PROTECTED, YOU CAN DO THAT, SO THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT TO LOOK AT IN THE FUTURE.
00:38:20.897: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  FOR STAFF, IS THIS SOMEWHERE ON OUR LIST, OR SHOULD WE PUT IT IN COMMISSION-PROPOSED BUSINESS TO FIGURE OUT IF WE WANT TO DO MORE ON THIS?
00:38:29.138: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  I THINK THIS WOULD BE THE TIME. IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU FEEL IS IMPORTANT, THEN WE COULD INCORPORATE IT NOW, FIGURE OUT APPROACHES. SOME OF THE CHALLENGES WITH THAT IS THAT THE MORE WE CAN DEFINE THEM PROBABLY THE BETTER IT MEETS THE INTENTION THAT YOU'RE ENVISIONING. IF IT'S MORE CRITERIA-BASED, I THINK WE HAVE TO BE OPEN THAT THERE MIGHT BE SIGNS OUT THERE THAT MIGHT VERY WELL FALL UNDER THAT CRITERIA THAT MIGHT BE MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO DISTINGUISH. SO, FOR EXAMPLE, IF WE SAY SIGNS ORIGINALLY CONSTRUCTED BEFORE 1950, THAT OPENS IT UP TO ANY SIGN CONSTRUCTED BEFORE 1950, WHETHER WE THINK IT'S SOMETHING WE PERSONALLY DEEM TO BE MORE ICONIC OR NOT. SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE COULD DEFINITELY TRY TO INCORPORATE NOW, AS PART OF THIS DRAFT BEFORE YOU TAKE ACTION ON IT, OR CERTAINLY IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE COULD PRIORITIZE THROUGH THE WORK PLAN PROCESS TO FOLLOW UP IN QUICK ORDER.
00:39:36.706: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  THANK YOU. I DON'T KNOW. AGAIN, LIKE, I WELCOME OTHER THOUGHTS ON THAT. I MEAN, BECAUSE THIS WILL, AS POINTED OUT, LIKE THERE'S A NUMBER OF SIGNS THAT ARE IN THE COMMUNITY THAT NO LONGER FIT IN THIS, SO SHOULD SOMETHING HAPPEN TO THEM, WE CAN'T NECESSARILY PULL THEM BACK IN.
00:39:58.528: >> RIGHT, RIGHT.
00:40:01.096: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  AND I WELCOME THOUGHTS, AGAIN, IF THAT'S A HUGE PROBLEM. [ OFF MIC ].
00:40:07.703: >> THERE'S THE Z.B.A. THE ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS, IF IT'S DAMAGED. [ OFF MIC ].
00:40:14.143: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  GOT IT. AND THE CRITERIA IS IF IT GOES BEFORE THE Z.B.A. IS REALLY A HARDSHIP FOR PRACTICAL DIFFICULTY.
00:40:24.486: >> CORRECT, RIGHT.
00:40:25.354: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  GOT IT.
00:40:26.321: >> I MEAN, IF YOU'RE TRULY WANTING, THOUGH, TO PRESERVE THOSE, IT'S WORTH EXPLORING OR PROVIDING FOR THAT IN YOUR ORDINANCE, RATHER THAN RELYING ON THE Z.B.A. TO OR ASKING THE Z.B.A. REALLY, TO PROTECT THEM, BECAUSE THAT'S NOT REALLY THEIR ROLE. I DON'T KNOW. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?
00:40:47.910: >> ROD ARROYO. JUST ONE THOUGHT ON THAT. IF YOU CHOOSE TO GO DOWN THAT ROUTE, I WOULD RECOMMEND DOING THAT MAYBE AS A FOLLOW-UP, BECAUSE I THINK COMING UP WITH THAT TYPE OF CRITERIA COULD BECOME A VERY EXTENDED DISCUSSION. AND I THINK THERE'S SOME SENSE OF URGENCY BECAUSE OF CASE LAW AND THE LIKE, SO I WOULD UPDATE THOSE AND ADD IT TO YOUR WORK PROGRAM AND ADD IT AS A SEPARATE DISCUSSION, BECAUSE I DON'T THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE GOING TO ACCOMPLISH IN ONE MEETING. I HAVE BEEN THROUGH THESE TYPES OF DISCUSSIONS BEFORE, AND IT INVOLVES A LOT OF THOUGHT AND CRITERIA AND EVALUATION AND TYPICALLY LEADS TO AN EXTENDED TIME FOR ANALYSIS, JUST BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE, SO --
00:41:34.657: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  GOT IT. WELL, YOU'LL SEE SOMETHING DURING COMMISSION-PROPOSED BUSINESS THEN. I'LL LET YOU GUYS KNOW THAT I THINK I'LL JUST TACK THAT ON DURING COMMISSION-PROPOSED BUSINESS. THAT'S ALL THAT I HAVE FOR RIGHT NOW.
00:41:48.638: >> OKAY.
00:41:49.571: >> IF I MAY, I DID WANT TO ADDRESS COMMISSIONER MILLS. WE DID HAVE A SIGN WHICH I THINK YOU'RE PROBABLY FAMILIAR WITH, WHICH IS THE BEER DEPOT SIGN THAT HAD FALLEN DOWN. THAT, WE DID HAVE A REMEDY BY GOING TO THE ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS. IT WAS NOT DESIGNATED AS ONE, BUT IT DID RECEIVE VARIANCES SO THEY COULD BUILD THE SAME SIGN, SAME DIMENSIONS, SAME LOCATION. SO WE DO HAVE AN AVENUE THROUGH THE Z.B.A. FOR SIGNS THAT WE DEEM SOMEWHAT VALUABLE TO THE CITY.
00:42:24.373: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  THANK YOU.
00:42:26.908: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? COMMISSIONER BRIGGS.
00:42:28.277: >> COMISSIONER BRIGGS:  IF ANYBODY ELSE WANTS TO SPEAK, I WOULD BE HAPPY. I DIDN'T SEE ANYBODY RAISING THEIR HANDS. I'LL JUST ADD MORE THOUGHTS. SO, THINKING ABOUT THE CLOCK AND ELECTRIC -- ELECTRONIC MESSAGING SIGNS, I STILL REMAIN CONCERNED THAT WE ARE SUGGESTING THAT UP TO 50% OF A TOTAL PERMANENT SIGN AREA CAN BE DIGITAL. I JUST -- I DON'T UNDERSTAND. WE HAVE HAD MAJOR DISCUSSIONS IN CITY COUNCIL ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE. I MEAN, I KNOW THIS IS A VERY MINOR SORT OF PIECE, BUT IT'S A LOT OF ENERGY BEING USED AROUND SIGNAGE. WHY? WHY ARE WE...  I MEAN, FROM AN AESTHETIC PURPOSE, I DON'T THINK THEY SERVE ANY PURPOSE IN OUR COMMUNITY, BUT I THINK WE COULD REDUCE THAT TO ALLOW FOR THAT AREA, TO ALLOW FOR CERTAIN FUNCTIONALITY THAT WE APPRECIATE IN OUR COMMUNITY, LIKE CLOCKS, LIKE GAS STATION SIGNS, THAT AREN'T -- SHOULDN'T BE TAKING UP MORE THAN 50% OF A SIGN AREA, BUT THEN DISCOURAGE HAVING MORE SORT OF DIGITAL -- LARGER DIGITAL SIGNS THAT ARE GOING TO BE COMMUNICATING MESSAGING ACROSS OUR COMMUNITY. SO, I WOULD -- I MEAN, I WOULD LOOK FOR RECOMMENDATIONS ON WHAT THAT PROPER AREA MIGHT BE, BUT I WOULD SUSPECT IT MIGHT BE MORE AROUND THE 20%. YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A GAS STATION, THEY WOULD PROBABLY HAVE A FAIR AMOUNT OF SIGNAGE. IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A LARGE BUILDING, I CAN'T IMAGINE YOU'RE TALKING MUCH MORE THAN AN AREA LIKE THAT, SO I WOULD BE IN FAVOR OF THAT, AND I WOULD BE CURIOUS TO SEE IF THERE'S OTHER SUPPORT FOR THAT, ENTERTAINING THAT DISCUSSION.
00:44:06.275: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  AND JUST AS A REMINDER TO THE COMMISSION, THAT 50% NUMBER CAME OUT OF OUR CURRENT CHANGEABLE COPY PORTION IN OUR CURRENT CODE, SO THE PROPOSED DRAFT IS SORT OF -- I THINK IT DOES TAKE AN ASSUMPTION THAT CHANGEABLE COPY IS AKIN TO ELECTRONIC MESSAGING, SO IF THE COMMISSION DOESN'T FEEL THAT THAT'S THE SAME AND THAT IT WARRANTS SOME REDUCED SCALE, AGAIN, THIS IS THE TIME TO CONSIDER THAT.
00:44:43.712: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN: COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN.
00:44:46.815: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN:  THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR, AND THANK YOU FOR THE EXPLANATION OF THE ORIGIN OF THAT. YOU KNOW, THINKING ABOUT THE CHANGEABLE COPY AND ELECTRONIC SIGNAGE, I DON'T KNOW, I FEEL AS THOUGH I TEND TO GROUP CHANGEABLE GAS STATION SIGNAGE MORE IN THE REALM OF ELECTRONIC INFORMATION, AS OPPOSED TO, YOU KNOW, THE CHANGEABLE TEXT I THINK OF A MARQUEE OF A MOVIE THEATER DOWNTOWN. I THINK OF JACK'S HARDWARE, AND THOSE SEEM TO BE -- THOSE SEEM TO BE A CLASS UNTO THEIR OWN, AS OPPOSED TO THE DIGITAL SIGNAGE THAT WE SEE AT GAS STATIONS, WHICH FEEL MUCH MORE AKIN TO THE SHARING OF INFORMATION THAT YOU WOULD SEE ON ANY DIGITAL BANNER. SO I AM NOT SURE WHAT THE DIRECTION IS, BUT I THINK THERE IS DISTINCTION, AND I HEARD COMMISSIONER BRIGGS THROW OUT 20%. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WENT OUT WITH A RULER, BUT CERTAINLY OPEN TO SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
00:45:52.481: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN: COMMISSIONER TRUDEAU?
00:45:57.652: >> COMMISSIONER TRUDEAU:  I AGREE. I WOULD CONSIDER REVISING THIS, ALTHOUGH I WOULD WANT TO SEE SOME MEASUREMENTS. I'M LOOKING AT THE DRAFT NOW, AND IT'S 50% OF THE SIGN AREA FOR SIGN FACE, SO IT'S NOT 50% OF THE TOTAL ALLOWABLE SIGN AREA, BUT 50% OF THE FACE, SO WHEN THINKING IN CONTEXT OF A GAS STATION SIGN, I COULD SEE HALF OF THAT BEING THE PRICING AND HALF SORT OF BEING THE LABELING AROUND IT, SO IT DOESN'T FEEL TOO FAR OFF TO ME, ALTHOUGH I WOULD BE HAPPY TO CONSIDER REDUCING THAT. I'M ALSO NOT SUPER ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT GAS STATIONS IN THE CONTEXT OF CLIMATE CHANGE -- [ LAUGHTER ] -- SO NOT TOO CONCERNED ABOUT MAKING THAT BUSINESS TRICKIER.
00:46:43.932: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN: COMMISSIONER SAUVE?
00:46:46.034: >> COMMISSIONER SAUVE:  SO, FOLLOW-UP ON THAT TOPIC, AND THEN KIND OF SWING BACK TO ANOTHER ONE. SO, THE ILLUMINATION, I GUESS WHEN I LOOK AT THE DIGITAL ELECTRONIC ILLUMINATION, I THINK OF IT AS DIODES, SO WHEN THAT CONTEXT, LIKE THE PRICE OF A GAS STATION SIGN IS ILLUMINATED, EVEN IF IT'S 50% OF THAT FACE, IT COULD BE ONLY 20% OF THOSE LIGHTS ARE ILLUMINATED BECAUSE IT'S SELECTING THOSE PIXELS FOR THE CONTENT, AND SO IT'S NOT ACTUALLY 100% ILLUMINATED FROM THE 50% FACE, SO BECAUSE IT'S CHANGING TO SELECT THOSE DIODES FOR THE MESSAGE, SO THAT'S WHERE I THINK IT MIGHT ACTUALLY BE 20% IN ILLUMINATED LIGHTS. I CAN'T GUARANTEE IT. IT COULD BE 50% ALL THE TIME. SOMEBODY COULD FLASH THE WHOLE THING. BUT SINCE IT IS JUST 50% OF THE FACE, AND THERE'S SOME CONSISTENCY BETWEEN ONE TYPE OF COPY VERSUS THE OTHER, IT COULD LEAN PEOPLE TO USE CHANGEABLE -- YOU KNOW, WANT -- THERE ARE OPTIONS FOR THEM TO KIND OF MANEUVER WITH SOME OF THOSE ENERGY SELECTIONS TOO. SO, I'M OPEN FOR MORE DISCUSSION. THAT'S THE OTHER DETAILED KIND OF INTERPRETATION THAT I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND, IS THE KIND OF DIODE AND PERCENTAGE OF USE AT ANY TIME. THE OTHER THING THAT I WANT TO SWING BACK TO IS THE DISCUSSION WITH MURALS AND CONTENT  AND HOW -- I KNOW WE HAD THIS DISCUSSION A LITTLE BIT AT ONE OF THE PREVIOUS MEETINGS ABOUT HOW THERE COULD BE CONTENT SPECIFIC TO THE BUSINESS THAT MIGHT BE SELECTED AS PART OF A SIGN WHILE THE REST OF THE MURAL MAY BE ART AND HOW THAT GETS INTERPRETED, AND HOW -- IS THAT CLEARLY LAID OUT IN THIS ORDINANCE RIGHT NOW TO BE ABLE TO DRAW A BOUNDING BOX AROUND THE SIGN AREA OF A MURAL VERSUS THE ART AREA OF A MURAL, IF IT'S SAID TO BE SUCH A COLLAGE OF THOSE TWO THINGS.
00:49:04.605: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  SORRY. I'M JUST TRYING TO FIND OUR SIGN.
00:49:09.678: >> IF YOU WANTED TO START WITH A DEFINITION OF SIGN, THAT MIGHT BE A GOOD PLACE TO START, TOWARD THE END. SO, WE WOULD SAY ANY DISPLAY OR OBJECT WHICH WAS PRIMARILY USED TO IDENTIFY OR DISPLAY INFORMATION ABOUT OR DIRECT ATTENTION TO A PERSON, INSTITUTION, ORGANIZATION, BUSINESS, PRODUCT, EVENT, LOCATION, OR OTHERWISE OR ANY RELIGIOUS, POLITICAL, SOCIAL, IDEOLOGICAL OR OTHER MESSAGE, BY ANY MEANS WHICH IS PHYSICAL FROM ANY STREET, SIDEWALK, ALLEY, PUBLIC PARK OR OTHER PROPERTY, AND/OR IS LOCATED ON OR SET IN A PUBLIC STRUCTURE OR PIECE OF LAND. IT DOES NOT INCLUDE GOODS DISPLAYED IN A WINDOW. IT IS ESSENTIALLY ANYTHING THAT ATTRACTS ATTENTION TO ANYTHING COULD BE CONSIDERED A SIGN. THE CHALLENGE IS HOW TO DEFINE ART IN TERMS OF SIGNAGE, AND I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY A PLACE WE DON'T NECESSARILY WANT TO GO IN THE SIGN ORDINANCE, AND I THINK THAT THE POLICY THAT THE CITY STAFF HAS USED IN TERMS OF ALLOWING A CITYSCAPE MURAL TO BE PLACED ON A BUILDING THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE A DIRECT REFERENCE TO A BUSINESS SEEMS TO BE A REASONABLE APPROACH. YOU CAN CREATE ADDITIONAL MURAL STANDARDS OR PUBLIC ART STANDARDS THAT WOULD BE SEPARATE, BUT WE'D REALLY JUST TO KEEP THOSE OUT OF THE SIGN REGULATION ITSELF, BECAUSE IT GETS TO BE A VERY TRICKY LINE TO DRAW.
00:50:45.839: >> I GUESS THAT'S MY QUESTION ABOUT EVEN A CITYSCAPE. IF YOU'RE AN URBAN PLANNING FIRM AND YOU PAINT A CITYSCAPE ON THE SIDE OF YOUR BUILDING, THAT COULD BE INTERPRETED AS CONTENT DRIVEN, BUT YOU COULD -- YOU KNOW, SO I AM NOT SURE. THEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT CONTENT, IF IT'S ASSOCIATED, BUT --
00:51:06.227: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  YEAH, BUT THE ALTERNATIVE, WITHOUT SOME LEVEL OF THAT INTERPRETATION, THE ALTERNATIVE IS TO SAY NO MURALS, BECAUSE THEY EXCEED THE SIGN, AND I DON'T -- I THINK IT'S REASONABLE TO ASSUME THAT THAT'S NOT OUR ASPIRATION, SO I THINK YOUR CONCERN IS REASONABLE, AND YES, IT COULD BE THAT, YOU KNOW, IF YOU WANTED TO COME AND PAINT A MURAL ON BUILDINGS FOR YOUR ARCHITECTURAL STUDIO, WE MIGHT SAY IT'S A LITTLE BIT TOO CLOSELY DRAWING ATTENTION TO WHAT YOUR BUSINESS IS, DESPITE YOUR PROCESS TO SAY, WELL, WE DON'T DO THESE TYPES OF BUILDINGS. I DO BETTER BUILDINGS, OR WHATEVER. BUT, ULTIMATELY, WE DO HAVE TO MAKE THAT INTERPRETATION, THAT WE THINK IT IS MEETING THAT INTENTION OF SIGNAGE, AND IS IT MEETING THE DEFINITION, AND THEN ULTIMATELY, JUST LIKE ANY RECOURSE IN THE ORDINANCE, IF YOU DISAGREE WITH THAT, WE GIVE IT TO YOU AND YOU GET TO HAVE YOUR DAY WITH THE ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS TO SAY THAT I BELIEVE THE PLANNING MANAGER IS UNFAIRLY CALLING THIS A SIGN WHEN IT IS CLEARLY NOT, AND THAT IS A RELEASE VALVE, IF YOU WILL, TO VALIDATE THAT INTERPRETATION OR NOT.
00:52:28.075: >> COMMISSIONER WEATHERBEE: LIKE WE ARE LOOKING AT THE BOUNDING BOXES. COULD YOU PUT A SIGN IN A MURAL, OR IS IT A BLACK OR WHITE DIVISION? I'M JUST TRYING TO MAKE A DISTINCTION.
00:52:45.259: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  THANK YOU FOR MAKING THIS EASY FOR ME.
00:52:50.531: >> COMMISSIONER WEATHERBEE:  I WOULD RATHER POKE LOOPHOLES NOW THAN AFTER ADOPTION.
00:52:55.770: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  SIMILARLY, IF A MURAL SAYS SPONSORED BY BRETT IN THE CORNER, WE MIGHT MAKE THAT SAME INTERPRETATION THAT, IN FACT, THAT IS NOT ADVERTISING FOR THAT BUSINESS, EVEN IF IT HAS TO BE. BUT I GUESS THE QUICK ANSWER IS IF THERE WAS SOME QUESTION AND A PORTION OF THE SIGNAGE SEEMED TO BE MORE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE BUSINESS, WE WOULD PROBABLY MEASURE IT AS SIGNAGE.
00:53:17.958: >> COMMISSIONER WEATHERBEE: OKAY. AND THEN I JUST WANTED TO SOME CLARIFICATION ON THE DRAFT AS PROPOSED, BECAUSE WE HAVE GOT, YOU KNOW, A 55-PAGE WITH A SECOND DRAFT WITH EDITS IN THE BACK. SOME OF THOSE HAVE BEEN INCORPORATED INTO THE ORIGINAL DRAFT, AND SOME HAVEN'T, MOSTLY IN REGARDS TO SIGN ORDINANCE OR THE LIGHTING COMPONENTS, AND SO I JUST WANT CLARIFICATION. AS WE GET KIND OF, I THINK --
00:53:49.423: >> WE ARE PROPOSING THE APRIL 16TH DRAFT SANS STRIKE THRU --
00:53:57.297: >> COMMISSIONER SAUVE:  JUST IF WE MAKE ANY AMENDMENTS TONIGHT, THAT THOSE ARE THE GUIDES BASED ON THE LIGHTING ORDINANCE.
00:54:13.414: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN: COMMISSIONER WEATHERBEE?
00:54:14.815: >> COMMISSIONER WEATHERBEE:  SO AS YOU WERE READING OFF THE DEFINITION OF A SIGN, BY ANY MEANS WHICH IS VISIBLE FROM ANY PUBLIC STREET, SIDEWALK, ALLEY, PUBLIC PARK OR PROPERTY, WHAT ABOUT ROOFTOP SIGNS? I LIVE NEAR THE STADIUM. THERE'S A LOT OF AIR TRAFFIC IN THE AREA. IS THAT COVERED IN OUR SIGN ORDINANCE?
00:54:37.738: >> ROOFTOP, AS IN PAINTED ON A ROOF?
00:54:46.814: >> COMMISSIONER WEATHERBEE: PAINTED ON OR ATTACHED TO THE ROOF.
00:54:49.950: >> THAT HAS NEVER COME UP IN ANY OF OUR CONVERSATIONS. THAT IS INTERESTING.
00:54:54.522: >> COMMISSIONER WEATHERBEE:  I GET THAT, BECAUSE, AGAIN, THERE IS AIR TRAFFIC, AND --
00:54:58.425: >> I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT WOULD FALL UNDER A COMMONLY -- A COMMONLY CONSIDERED PUBLIC P PLACE, THE SKIES. I MEAN, CLEARLY, THEY ARE PUBLIC, BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT WOULD BE GENERALLY ACCESSIBLE TO THE PUBLIC, AND SO I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU WOULD DO THAT, IF IT WAS A FLAT ON THE ROOF SIGN, CHRIS.
00:55:20.814: >> IT'S ACTUALLY COME UP BEFORE.
00:55:22.549: >> HAS IT?
00:55:24.284: >> AND FROM MY INTERPRETATION OF THE PREVIOUS ORDINANCE, I DID NOT COUNT THAT AS SIGNAGE. THEY ENDED UP NOT ACTUALLY DOING THE PAINTING OR WHATEVER SIGNAGE THEY WERE GOING TO DO ON TOP OF THE ROOF, BUT I WOULD HAVE EXEMPTED IT FROM THEIR TOTAL SIGNAGE, BECAUSE IT COULD NOT BE SEEN OTHER THAN FROM ABOVE. IT WAS OUT BY THE ANN ARBOR AIRPORT.
00:55:46.106: >> COMMISSIONER WEATHERBEE:  I WOULD THINK WITH GOOGLE EARTH AND NOW WHEN YOU LOOK ON GOOGLE MAPS, YOU COULD SEE A FAIR NUMBER OF THESE, POTENTIALLY SEE THEM. I'M JUST THROWING IT OUT THERE.
00:55:56.350: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  IF I HAD TO SIGN MY NAME IN BLOOD RIGHT NOW, I WOULD SAY NO. I THINK THE INTENTION IS THAT IT WOULD BE SOMETHING VISIBLE GENERALLY FROM THE PUBLIC REALM, AND WHILE I GUESS TECHNICALLY YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO FIND PUBLIC PROPERTY THAT IS HIGH ENOUGH THAT YOU COULD SEE A ROOFTOP SIGN, GENERALLY THE PUBLIC EXPERIENCE WOULD LIKELY BE NOT TO SEE THAT, SO I THINK IT COULD BE -- THAT COULD BE DISTINCT. I THINK ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A GABLED ROOF ON A CORNER. THAT WOULD CLEARLY BE VISIBLE. HOWEVER, A PAINTING "BRETT IS A CHUMP" ON A FLAT ROOF, I DON'T THINK TYPICALLY YOU'RE GOING TO SEE IT FROM THE PUBLIC REALM.
00:56:45.698: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN: COMMISSIONER WOODS?
00:56:49.602: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS:  I HAVE A QUESTION THAT'S KIND OF RELATED TO CHANGEABLE COPY AND BILLBOARDS, AND HERE I'M -- JUST A QUESTION. MAYBE YOU CAN JUST CLARIFY IT. I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S BANK OF ANN ARBOR OR WHICH ONE IT IS THAT HAS THE BLUE-COLORED BILLBOARDS AND THEY CHANGE THEM FROM TIME TO TIME. THERE'S ONE OVER BY LIBERTY AND THE RAILROAD TRACKS, AND SO I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT DOES CHANGEABLE COPY MEAN, IN TERMS OF THE WAY THEY CHANGE THOSE BILLBOARDS JUST ABOUT EVERY MONTH, I THINK, AND SOMETIMES THERE ARE TWO -- WELL, I GUESS THERE ARE ALWAYS TWO BILLBOARDS THERE TOGETHER, AND YOU'RE LOOKING AT THEM, AND SOMETIMES IT'S KIND OF A WITTY LITTLE SAYING OR SOMETHING. I DON'T KNOW. THEY DO CATCH ATTENTION, AND THEY DO CHANGE, AND SO MY QUESTION IS HAVE THEY JUST KIND OF -- IS THIS JUST A NEW INTERPRETATION, OR IS IT OKAY FOR BILLBOARDS TO CHANGE, AND --
00:57:57.904: >> THOSE ARE EXISTING SIGNS THAT WOULDN'T BE IMPACTED BY THE CURRENT LANGUAGE.
00:58:04.344: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS:  OKAY.
00:58:05.845: >> SO I AM NOT SURE HOW -- THEY MAY HAVE BEEN THAT WAY FROM AN EARLIER STANDPOINT.
00:58:10.984: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  I DON'T THINK THEY COUNT AS CHANGEABLE COPY. THE CHANGEABLE COPY IS INTENDED TO ADJUST THE MESSAGING WITHOUT CHANGING THE FACE OF THE SIGN, SO WHETHER IT'S GAS STATION PRICES OR WHETHER IT'S A SCROLL THAT SAYS "BOAT SHOW THIS WEEKEND," OR WHAT HAVE YOU, THOSE ARE ALL FUNCTIONS THAT ARE NOT GOING TO CHANGE THE FACE OF THE SIGN. IN THE CASE OF A BILLBOARD, TYPICALLY THEY ARE CHANGING THE WHOLE FACE OF THE SIGNAGE ON A MUCH LESS FREQUENT BASIS WHILE MORE PERMANENT THAN A BUSINESS SIGN.
00:58:50.190: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS:  DOES IT DEPEND THEN ON THE AMOUNT OF COPY ON THE SIGN? BECAUSE THOSE BOARDS ACTUALLY DO CHANGE. IT WILL BE SOME PHRASING THAT CHANGES, AND SOMETIMES THERE'S A SLIGHT PICTURE OR SOMETHING ATTACHED TO IT, LIKE I THINK THERE WAS A CHAMELEON OR SOMETHING ON THERE, LIKE A LIZARD, AND THEN ITS TONGUE WAS ON THE OTHER BULLETIN BOARD OR SOMETHING. I MEAN, IT'S CLEVER, BUT MY QUESTION IS HAS IT BECOME SO CLEVER THAT IT ACTUALLY IS  -- HAS FOUND A WAY TO DO WHAT MANY RESIDENTS DIDN'T WANT TO HAPPEN. IN OTHER WORDS, YOU DO HAVE -- YOU KNOW, PEOPLE AREN'T CRAZY ABOUT BIG BILLBOARDS, AND YET HERE'S ONE THAT IS DOING WHAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO DO, BUT THEY HAVE JUST BEEN VERY CLEVER ABOUT IT.
00:59:42.375: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  NO, AGAIN, THEIR EXISTING SIGNS, I ACTUALLY DON'T HEAR A LOT OF NEGATIVE FEEDBACK ABOUT BILLBOARDS. I THINK GENERALLY PEOPLE HAVE THAT PERCEPTION, BUT I CAN'T SAY THAT WE GET A LOT OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT IT. AGAIN, I THINK THAT THE FREQUENCY OF THOSE CHANGING, I WOULD NOT PUT THEM INTO A CHANGEABLE COPY. THEY ARE KIND OF EXISTING, NONCONFORMING. THEY WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE NONCONFORMING PROVISIONS OF THE ORDINANCE. THAT IS, THEY COULDN'T BE EXPANDED, AND IF THEY WERE EVER REMOVED, IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO REESTABLISH THEM. BUT, NO, I DON'T THINK THAT BY CHANGING THEM ON A MONTHLY OR -- BASIS THAT IT WOULD FALL INTO THE CHANGEABLE COPY.
01:00:23.983: >> I THINK THAT YOU'RE RIGHT, AND I THINK THAT THE DEFINITION OF THE CHANGEABLE COPY THAT WE ADDED TALKS ABOUT REALLY ESSENTIALLY ANYTHING THAT CAN BE READILY CHANGED OR REARRANGED WITHOUT ALTERING THE FACE OF THE SIGN. IT SOUNDS LIKE THOSE ARE A WHOLESALE CHANGE OF THE BILLBOARD OR ANY OTHER SIGN THAT COULD CHANGE AS WELL. SOMEBODY WANTED TO CHANGE OUT THEIR WALL SIGN EVERY WEEK FOR WHATEVER REASON, THEY CAN DO THAT. THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S PROHIBITED BY THE CHANGEABLE COPY PORTION.
01:00:56.849: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS:  OKAY. AND THEN I GUESS JUST THE FACT THAT THESE TWO BILLBOARDS ARE SIDE BY SIDE, AND YOU CAN USE THE BILLBOARD AND CHANGE IT, IT'S ALMOST LIKE YOU HAVE A BIGGER SIGN IN A WAY. I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE NO ONE ELSE IS THINKING ABOUT IT. I MEAN, CERTAINLY I GUESS IT'S A GOOD BUSINESS THAT WE WANT TO KEEP IN TOWN, AND YET IT'S JUST INTERESTING, THE WAY THAT HAS CHANGED. SO, JUST SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT.
01:01:25.611: >> GOOD QUESTION.
01:01:32.618: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  FURTHER DISCUSSION? COMMISSIONER MILLS.
01:01:35.555: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  I KIND OF HAVE A QUESTION FOR COMMISSIONER SAUVE, BECAUSE YOU MENTIONED DIODES, AND I DON'T KNOW -- SO, WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ELECTRONIC SIGNS, LIKE THERE'S THE OLD SCHOOL -- THERE'S THE DIODES VERSUS LIKE A COMPUTER SCREEN, RIGHT, AND ONE OF THE CONCERNS OF THE COMPUTER SCREEN IS THAT IT'S STILL -- IT'S STILL TAKING ENERGY, EVEN IF THAT PIXEL, LIKE TO MAKE BLACK, RIGHT? CAN WE DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THAT AND THIS, AND IS THAT TRUE, THAT WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WITH THE DIODE IS LIKE OFF/ON, VERSUS A COMPUTER SCREEN, WHERE EVEN IF IT IS BLACK, IT IS STILL ON, AND IT IS STILL TAKING ENERGY? AND HAVE YOU GUYS SEEN DIGITAL ELECTRONIC SIGNS ORDINANCES -- AND AGAIN, GETTING BACK TO THE -- MAYBE THIS SQUARES THIS, BECAUSE IF YOU MOVE TO DIGITAL CLOCKS, AND CLEARLY, NOBODY ELSE CARES ABOUT DIGITAL CLOCKS, NOBODY ELSE HAS PICKED UP ON THAT, BUT IF YOU MOVE TO A DIGITAL CLOCK THAT IS A COMPUTER SCREEN, AND IT IS USING 100% OF THAT 50%, RATHER THAN JUST THE DIODES THAT ARE LIT UP. SO HAVE YOU GUYS SEEN THAT IN ORDINANCES? NO. SO MAYBE -- WHAT?
01:03:03.376: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  SO, I DON'T KNOW IF THE INFORMATION IS READILY AVAILABLE. IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE, WE COULD LOOK INTO IT. AND I GUESS I WANT TO UNDERSTAND, DO YOU -- THERE'S A BALANCE, RIGHT? DO WE CARE MORE ABOUT REDUCING THE ENERGY COSTS THAN THE VISIBILITY? LIKE, FOR EXAMPLE, SAY DIODES ARE MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT BECAUSE IT'S NOT A FULL SCREEN AND IT'S ONLY POTENTIAL SMALL PIXELS OR PORTIONS OF THAT SIGNAGE. THAT'S ALSO LIMITING THE FLEXIBILITY OF THAT AREA. PERHAPS A BUSINESS MIGHT SEE IT AS LESS EFFECTIVE MEANS OF BEING ABLE TO ADVERTISE THEIR BU BUSINESS. I GUESS I WANT TO GET A SENSE OF TRADEOFF. IS THAT A TRADEOFF THAT THE PLANNING COMMISSION WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS DRAFT GO IN? THAT IS, POTENTIALLY SACRIFICE A PERCEPTION OF VISIBILITY FOR ENERGY CONSERVATION?
01:04:03.235: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  AND WHAT I HEARD WAS, AND THE ARGUMENTS ABOUT THIS AND WHERE THIS IS, IS LARGELY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT, THOUGH I POTENTIALLY SHARE COMMISSIONER TRUDEAU'S CONCERN ABOUT GAS STATIONS GENERALLY, WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT GAS STATIONS CAN STILL ADVERTISE THEIR PRICES, BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO STILL NEED GAS, FOR AT LEAST A BIT.
01:04:28.294: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  I THINK THEY ARE OBLIGATED TO, IN FACT.
01:04:34.666: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  BUT WE DON'T WANT NECESSARILY EVERY BUSINESS TO HAVE A COMPUTER SCREEN THAT TAKES UP HALF OF THAT SIGN FACE. BECAUSE ONCE YOU PAINT IT, IT'S NOT USING ADDITIONAL ENERGY.
01:04:46.345: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  BUT KEEP IN MIND NOT ALL SIGNAGE IS GOING TO BE PAINTED.
01:04:49.781: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  RIGHT, OR WHATEVER IT IS. ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S A COMPUTER SCREEN, AGAIN, DURING THE DAY, IT'S USING A TON OF ELECTRICITY. THE OTHER SIGNS ARE NOT USING ELECTRICITY DURING THE DAY. IT'S USING MORE ELECTRICITY DURING THE DAY, BECAUSE IT HAS TO BE SO BRIGHT TO BE IN CONTRAST, RIGHT, AND SO WE GENERALLY WANT TO DISCOURAGE, I THINK, FROM AN ENERGY -- IF YOU CARE ABOUT IT FROM AN ENERGY PERSPECTIVE, WE WANT TO DISCOURAGE THAT, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE WE ARE NOT ALLOWING MOVING SIGNS, LIKE, YOU CAN'T CHANGE YOUR SIGN ALL THE TIME. WE REALLY DON'T WANT THAT DISTRACTION. RIGHT? WE ARE SAYING HAVE YOUR SIGN, LIKE, KEEP YOUR SIGN STABLE, SO --
01:05:25.851: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  BUT I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT THAT 50%, IT MIGHT NOT BE A DISTINCTION BETWEEN A COMPUTER SCREEN AND A PAINTED PANEL. IT MIGHT BE A DISTINCTION BETWEEN LED AND A FLUORESCENT BACK-LIT BOX.
01:05:45.304: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  YES, BUT MAYBE I JUST DON'T KNOW THE SIGN TECHNOLOGY, WHETHER OR NOT THE FLUORESCENT BACK LIT BOX IS -- HOW THAT WORKS DURING THE DAY.
01:05:56.748: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  IT'S PROBABLY TURNED OFF.
01:05:57.849: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  SO THAT'S GOOD. THAT'S BETTER. BUT THAT OPERATES AS EFFECTIVELY, ENERGY EFFICIENCY WISE, AS THE LIGHT BULB THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE ON IN THE EVENING.
01:06:10.896: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  BUT THE QUESTION IS HOW MUCH DO WE WANT TO GET RESTRICTIVE WITH RESPECT TO THE ENERGY CHOICES AS OPPOSED TO THE VISIBILITY OF THE SIGNAGE.
01:06:22.774: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  RIGHT, AND I WOULD SAY BECAUSE WE ARE ALLOWING FOR THIS ANYWAY, BECAUSE WE HAVE ALREADY CHOSEN TO TIE THESE TWO THINGS TOGETHER, WE ARE PULLING ENERGY INTO THIS WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT, AND I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT WE ARE PULLING ENERGY INTO THIS DISCUSSION BY MAKING THESE CHOICES. WHEN YOU ALLOW 50% VERSUS 20%, THAT HAS AN ENERGY IMPACT, AND KIND OF GETTING BACK TO WHAT WE ARE DISCUSSING AT OUR WORKING SESSION, ABOUT PULLING SUSTAINABILITY, BECAUSE IT IS PART OF THE FRAMEWORK FOR THE MASTER PLAN, PULLING IT INTO ALL OF OUR DECISIONS, ESPECIALLY WHEN WE ARE WRITING ORDINANCES, AS WE ARE DOING TODAY, THAT WE NEED TO BE CONSIDERING HOW THAT PLAYS OUT. I THINK THE ENERGY COMPONENT IS THE ONE THING WITHIN THE SUSTAINABILITY THAT'S ON THIS, OR THAT'S WITHIN THIS DISCUSSION. SUSTAINABILITY HAS MULTIPLE ELEMENTS. ENERGY IS THE ELEMENT THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THAT IS MOST RELEVANT HERE. AND SO WHAT I HEARD WAS THE REASON THAT WE NEED TO KEEP IT, AND I THINK CONVINCINGLY, THE REASON THAT WE NEED TO KEEP IT 50% IS FOR GAS STATIONS EFFECTIVELY, THOSE KINDS OF SIGNS, AND I -- IT'S MORE COMMON, I THINK, FOR THOSE GAS STATIONS TO, AS COMMISSIONER SAUVE POINTED OUT, BE USING DIODES, BUT THERE'S NOTHING STOPPING NOW EVERY OTHER USE FROM HAVING 50% OF THEIR SIGN BE A -- AN ELECTRIC SIGN OR AN ELECTRONIC SIGN, WHATEVER IS THE TERMINOLOGY THAT WE USE. AND SO I THINK THAT'S A -- I THINK THAT'S A PROBLEM.
01:07:57.602: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN: COMMISSIONER BRIGGS?
01:07:59.470: >> COMMISSIONER BRIGGS:  SO I HAVE BEEN SCANNING SIGN ORDINANCES AND FINALLY FOUND WHAT I NEEDED. SO, INDIANAPOLIS, THE WAY THAT THEY HANDLE THIS IS SIZE LIMITED TO 40% OF THE SIGN AREA, OR A HUNDRED SQUARE FEET, WHICHEVER IS LESSER, SO WE COULD -- ACTUALLY, I THINK A HUNDRED SQUARE FEET IS BIG, SO I WOULD RECOMMEND SMALLER THAN THAT, MYSELF, BUT I THINK THAT THERE'S A WAY THAT WE CAN ALLOW FOR 50% OF THE SIGN AREA AND STILL PERMIT THAT IN A GAS STATION TYPE SIGN, YOU KNOW, BUT NOT BE ENCOURAGING THEM FOR ALL OF THE OTHER POTENTIALLY LARGER SIGNS THAT ARE PERMITTED IN OTHER COMMERCIAL AREAS, IF SOMEBODY IS USING ALL OF THEIR SIGN SPACE FOR MONUMENT SIGN OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. SO I THINK THAT WOULD BE ONE WAY TO HANDLE MAKING AN EDIT TO THIS, IF -- I WOULD WELCOME THE CONSULTANT'S RECOMMENDATIONS ON THIS.
01:09:06.838: >> ARE YOU SUGGESTING A REDUCTION TO 40% BASED ON THAT? IS THAT WHAT I'M HEARING?
01:09:12.978: >> COMISSIONER BRIGGS:  I DON'T KNOW. WHAT AM I RECOMMENDING?
01:09:17.015: >> WERE YOU ALSO SAYING TO EXEMPT TO ALLOW GAS STATIONS TO HAVE MORE?
01:09:23.088: >> COMISSIONER BRIGGS:  NO. WHAT I WAS RECOMMENDING WAS THAT WE PLACE A SIZE LIMIT, WHETHER IT'S -- BUT -- OR A CERTAIN SQUARE FOOTAGE, AND THEN SAY WHICHEVER IS LESSER, SO THEN WE HAVE AN ABILITY TO NOT -- FOR THOSE, YOU KNOW, IN A SITUATION LIKE IN A GAS STATION, WHERE THAT'S JUST ONE SIDE OF THE SIGN FACE THAT THEY ARE USING, AND POTENTIALLY 50% IS APPROPRIATE ON THAT SIGN, IF WE CAN DEBATE A LITTLE BIT MORE AROUND THIS TABLE WHETHER OR NOT THAT SEEMS APPROPRIATE, 50%, BUT WHETHER WE HAVE A CAP ON THAT SQUARE FOOTAGE S WHAT I'M RECOMMENDING.
01:10:03.094: >> BUT YOU DO FOR THE SIGNS IN GENERAL. IT IS --
01:10:09.034: >> SO ELECTRONIC SIGNS COULD NEVER BE MORE THAN 100 SQUARE FEET.
01:10:13.305: >> I GUESS I'M MISSING THAT. 100 SQUARE FEET, TO ME, THAT SEEMS A LITTLE BIT LARGE. THAT'S A TEN BY TEN SIGN, OR WHATEVER, THAT IS A DIGITAL SIGN THAT WE ARE PERMITTING POTENTIALLY AS A DIGITAL BILLBOARD.
01:10:30.421: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  SO, GENERALLY, I'M HEARING LOTS OF QUESTIONS, SO MY GUT IS THAT -- I'M NOT HEARING A COMFORT YET WITH THE PLANNING COMMISSION POTENTIALLY TO TAKE ACTION ON THIS. THE OUTSTANDING ISSUES THAT WE SEEM TO BE COMING BACK TO ARE WHAT IS THE PERCENTAGE OF THAT ELECTRONIC MESSAGING POTENTIAL. I THINK WE ARE HAPPY TO LOOK AT SOME ALTERNATIVES TO ADDRESS THAT. I AM HEARING A DESIRE FOR MAYBE A LITTLE BIT MORE INFORMATION ON IS THIS DOING ENOUGH TO REDUCE ENERGY USE IN THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY, AND I -- I WILL SAY THAT I'M MORE WORRIED ABOUT ABOUT BEING ABLE TO DEFINITIVELY ANSWER THAT, BUT I'M HAPPY TO AT LEAST BRING BACK WHAT WE CAN IN THAT REGARD, AND THEN IT SEEMS GENERALLY I WAS HEARING SOME ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF MAYBE FOLLOWING UP ON A SORT OF RELIEF VALVE FOR OTHER TYPES OF SIGNAGE THAT MIGHT NOT FIT INTO THIS, BE IT THROUGH THE ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS, WHETHER THAT'S ADEQUATE OR ANOTHER MECHANISM WOULD BE APPROPRIATE.
01:11:51.102: >> AND CLOCKS.
01:11:52.103: >> AND MURALS.
01:11:54.339: >> I'M IN FAVOR OF CLOCKS.
01:11:57.442: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  WELL, WHAT'S THE ISSUE WITH MURALS? OKAY, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. [ OFF MIC ].
01:12:03.281: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  IT'S THE FINE LINE BETWEEN MURAL AND ADVERTISING.
01:12:06.684: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  NO MURALS?
01:12:07.585: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  I LIKE MURALS. IT'S JUST HOW WE ARE DEALING WITH IT. YEAH.
01:12:15.827: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  OKAY.
01:12:16.861: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN: COMMISSIONER TRUDEAU?
01:12:17.795: >> COMMISSIONER TRUDEAU:  YEAH, I THINK YOU GOT IT, AT LEAST FROM WHAT I HAVE HEARD AT THE TABLE. JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON THE ELECTRONIC SIGNS, ONE OF MY HESITATIONS IS THE TECHNOLOGY IN THIS SPACE IS CHANGING, POTENTIALLY, AND IT'S REALLY HARD TO PIN DOWN AN ORDINANCE SPECIFIC TO THE TECH. FOR EXAMPLE, E-INC. TECHNOLOGY DOESN'T REQUIRE THE SAME KIND OF ENERGY USE THAT LCD TECHNOLOGY REQUIRES, WHICH IS THE TECH THAT IS IN A KINDLE, SO IT WILL ONLY USE ENERGY WHEN THE PAGE TURNS, OR IT WILL ONLY USE ENERGY WHEN THE SIGN TURNS, SO ILLUMINATED IN DAYLIGHT IT WOULDN'T EVEN NEED IT, BUT THAT WOULD BE A BACK LIGHT SIGN. I AGREE THAT HAVING REALLY BRIGHTLY LIT LCD DISPLAYS DURING THE DAY IS AN ENERGY USE THAT I WOULD NOT LIKE TO SEE, AND IF THERE'S A REASONABLE WAY TO REGULATE THAT, THAT WOULD BE GREAT, AND I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING WHAT YOU CAN FIND, BUT I ALSO DON'T WANT TO OVERDO IT AND CUT OFF WHAT MIGHT BE PRETTY REASONABLE TECHNOLOGY APPROACHES THAT ARE UP AND COMING OR EVEN POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE SOON.
01:13:37.708: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  SO IT SOUNDS LIKE WE NEED A MOTION TO POSTPONE. COMMISSIONER BRIGGS?
01:13:41.379: >> COMISSIONER BRIGGS:  I HAVE ONE OTHER THING TO BRING UP AND ONE COMMENT ON THAT, WHICH IS THAT I THINK WE COULD REVISIT THE SIGN ORDINANCE AS TECHNOLOGY SHIFTS, BECAUSE CURRENTLY THE TECHNOLOGY IS AROUND DIGITAL, AND I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT THAT'S GOING TO BE WHERE IT IS FOR AT LEAST A FEW YEARS, SO I WOULD RATHER HAVE US COME BACK AND PROTECT IT AROUND WHERE THE TECHNOLOGY IS TODAY, BUT ONE THING THAT WE GOT A LETTER ON WAS AROUND THE ISSUE OF SIGNAGE ON SINGLE-FAMILY HOMES, SINCE THAT SPACE AROUND HAVING A THREE-FOOT SIGN THAT'S SORT OF PERMITTED FOUR FEET FROM THE DOOR AND ALSO A TEMPORARY SIGN, AND, YOU KNOW, WE ARE ALLOWING FOR IF A SPACE -- WE ALLOW THAT IF THERE IS A UNIT THAT'S UP FOR RENTAL -- SO I WONDER IF WE COULD JUST HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF DISCUSSION AROUND SORT OF THE THOUGHT AROUND THAT NEED FOR THAT SIGNAGE, THOSE MULTIPLE TYPES OF SIGNS THAT WENT INTO THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE.
01:14:37.935: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  SO I CAN COMMENT ON THAT. I THINK THIS HAS MORE TO DO WITH LEASE SIGNS THAN ANYTHING ELSE, AND I WOULD ACTUALLY SAY FOR SALE SIGNS AS WELL. WHEN A PROPERTY -- SO A PROPERTY MANAGEMENT COMPANY TYPICALLY HAS THEIR SIGN UP ON THE BUILDING AT ALL TIMES, MARKETING IT -- IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY SAY THAT IT IS AVAILABLE. IT JUST SAYS PROPERTY MANAGEMENT COMPANY OR PHONE NUMBER FOR THEM, AND WHEN THEY DO COME UP TO RENT, A TEMPORARY SIGN TO LEASE IS OFTEN ERECTED TO NOTIFY PEOPLE THAT THE PROPERTY IS AVAILABLE FOR RENT. TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE, RIGHT NOW, I'M MARKETING A PROPERTY FOR SALE THAT HAS A PROPERTY MANAGER'S CONTACT INFORMATION ON THE FRONT. WE ARE TWO DIFFERENT ENTITIES, BUT THAT'S WHERE I GET TO PUT MY FOR SALE SIGN, ON THE FRONT, AND THE PROPERTY MANAGEMENT'S CONTACT INFORMATION IS ON THE BUILDING. I DO UNDERSTAND IT'S A LOT OF SIGNAGE AND PRETTY MUCH DOUBLES THE SIGNAGE, BUT I THINK IT IS PRETTY OFTEN WHAT IS NEEDED AND WHAT MYSELF AS A REAL ESTATE AGENT WOULD NEED FOR PROPERTY SIGNAGE IN A FOR SALE SIGN WHEN IT IS RENTED CURRENTLY.
01:15:53.778: >> AND IF I JUST MIGHT ADD, MY OTHER REASON FOR TEMPORARY SIGNAGE, FOR POLITICAL EXPRESSION, SIGNIFICANTLY, REALLY, YOU HAVE GOT TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ALLOW FOR THAT, AND TEMPORARY SIGNAGE IS TYPICALLY THE MOST COMMON WAY THAT THAT IS DONE SO THAT YOU ARE PROVIDING FOR IT THAT WAY.
01:16:14.031: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN: COMMISSIONER WOODS?
01:16:14.932: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS:  I JUST WANTED TO GO BACK TO A COMMENT THAT ONE OF THE PERSONS IN THE AUDIENCE MENTIONED, THAT PERHAPS THE PUBLIC WASN'T FEELING THAT THEY HAD HAD ENOUGH TIME TO READ AND THEN HAVE INPUT INTO THIS, AND SO MY SENSE IS PERHAPS WE ARE THINKING TOWARDS A POSTPONEMENT, AND I THINK THAT WOULD INDEED GIVE MORE TIME, PERHAPS, FOR THAT PUBLIC INPUT AS WELL. SO, I WOULD CERTAINLY BE IN FAVOR OF THAT. THE OTHER QUESTION I HAD, AND I THINK THIS WAS DURING YOUR PRESENTATION, I MIGHT HAVE HEARD IT WRONG, BUT DID IT INDICATE THAT POLITICAL SIGNS NEEDED TO BE REMOVED 18 HOURS AFTER THE ELECTION?
01:16:56.841: >> THAT'S THE CURRENT ORDINANCE.
01:16:59.376: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS:  THAT'S THE CURRENT ORDINANCE. AND SO IS THAT DUE TO BE CHANGED, OR YOU ARE NOT CHANGING THAT PART?
01:17:05.549: >> IT'S CHANGING TO 65 TOTAL DAYS. NO TEMPORARY SIGN CAN BE UP LONGER THAN 65 DAYS.
01:17:12.422: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS:  TOTAL DAYS.
01:17:13.290: >> SO THEORETICALLY FOR AN ELECTION, YOU COULD PUT IT UP 65 DAYS IN ADVANCE AND KEEP IT UP FIVE DAYS AFTER, SO IT'S JUST A TIME PERIOD, AND IT'S NOT CONTENT BASED.
01:17:21.766: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS:  OKAY. THANK YOU.
01:17:24.368: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  AND COMMISSIONER WOODS, DID I HEAR YOU MAKE A MOTION TO POSTPONE?
01:17:29.974: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS:  YES, I MOVE THAT WE POSTPONE, DEPENDING ON WHEN STAFF FEELS THAT IT IS THEN READY TO COME BACK.
01:17:40.117: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  SECOND BY BY COMMISSIONER MILLS. ANY DISCUSSION ON THE POSTPONEMENT?
01:17:44.221: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  I WOULD JUST FOR THOSE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN FOLLOWING IT, MAKE SURE YOU DROP YOUR NAME AND EMAIL ON ONE OF OUR CARDS IN THE BASKET BEFORE YOU GO, AND WE WILL MAKE SURE WE ALERT YOU WHEN IT IS RESCHEDULED.
01:17:55.532: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  THANK YOU. ANY DISCUSSION ON THE POSTPONEMENT? ALL OF THOSE IN FAVOR, PLEASE SAY AYE. [ CHORUS OF AYES ] OPPOSED? ALL RIGHT. IT'S POSTPONED. MOVING ON TO THE GARNET REZONING AND CITE PLAN FOR CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL. WE'LL BEGIN THIS EVENING WITH A REPORT OR ACTUALLY A PRESENTATION BY THE PETITIONER. THEN WE'LL MOVE ON TO STAFF REPORT, PUBLIC HEARING, AND THEN DISCUSSION. MR. MOORE, WELCOME.
01:18:26.864: >> THANK YOU. IS THIS THUMB DRIVE FOR THE SIGN, OR IS THIS SOMEBODY ELSE'S, CHRIS? THIS THUMB DRIVE THAT'S IN HERE, IS THIS SOMEBODY ELSE'S PRESENTATION? YEAH. I JUST DIDN'T KNOW IF SOMEONE WAS WALKING OUT WITHOUT THEIR THUMB DRIVE. (COMPUTER SOUND.) OKAY... (MOUSE CLICKING.) GOOD EVENING. SO, PRESENTING HERE TONIGHT A PROJECT AT 325 EAST SUMMIT, WHICH WE HAVE CALLED THE GARNET, AFTER THE MOTHER OF ONE OF THE DEVELOPERS FOR THE PROJECT, GARNET JOHNSON, WHO HAS BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN REVITALIZING THIS NEIGHBORHOOD AND PART OF THE TOWN, WHICH WAS KNOWN HISTORICALLY FOR HAVING THE STOCKYARDS, NOT BEING A VERY PARTICULARLY DESIRABLE PART OF TOWN BUT IS NOW ONE OF THE NICEST PLACES IN THE■■ CITY TO LIVE. IT'S CLOSE TO THE FARMERS MARKET, GARITY TOWN, ZIMMERMAN' ET CETERA.  WE ARE LOCATED ON THE CORNER OF BEAKS AND SUMMIT. SO IN THIS IMAGE, BEAKS IS RUNNING OFF DIAGONALLY ON THE RIGHT SIDE, AND SUMMIT ALONG THE SOUTHERN FACE OF THE BUILDING. THERE IS AN EXISTING ALLEY WHICH RUNS ROUGHLY NORTH SOUTH. THE SITE FALLS APPROXIMATELY 11 POINT DIAGONALLY. THE HIGH POINT IS AT BAKE  -- BEAKS, AND THE LOW PART IS UNDER THE ALLEY. THE GARAGE LEVEL IS COMPLETELY BELOW GRADE AT THE SOUTHEASTERN CORNER OF THE SITE BUT IS EXPOSED AT THE NORTHWEST CORNER OF THE SITE SO THAT CARS COULD DRIVE IN FROM THE ALLEY. SO THIS IS THE FIRST FLOOR PLAN THAT SHOWS HOW THE BUILDING WAS ORGANIZED. THERE IS A CENTRAL ENTRY CORRIDOR. THE ENTRY WAS OFF THE SUMMIT SIDE, WHICH IS THE ONLY PLACE THAT GIVES THE -- THE PUBLIC SIDEWALK IS HERE IN A SPECKLED PATTERN, AND THEN OUR ENTRY WALK WOULD COME OFF OF THAT TO THE MAINO THE OR WHICH WOULD INCLUDE THE ELEVATOR AND THE STAIRS TO THE UPPER LEVEL. WE ARE PROPOSING A SINGLE UNIT ON THE EAST SIDE AND TWOTS ON THE WEST SIDE. SOME OF YOU MAY BE FAMILIAR WIO EAST, WHAT WAS CALLED THE FLAT IRON BUILDING, AND THAT'S NOT MY RECORD. I WAS NOT THE ARCHITECT ON THAT. AND MAYBE YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THE MARK, ONE OF MY PROJECTS OVER ON LIBERTY STREET ACROSS FROM THE ARGUS FARM STOP MARKET. SO THIS BUILDING IS DESIGNED TO BE THE LOVE CHILD OF THOSE TWO PROJECTS, SO IT ADDS ELEMENTS OF BOTH, OF THE MARK AND THE FLAT IRON BUILDING, AND WE'LL SEE THAT AS WE GO THROUGH THERE. THIS IS THE BELOW GRADE GARAGE LEVEL, SO THE ENTRY IS OFF THE ALLEY HERE. IT'S WHERE THE -- ALL OF THE SOLID WASTE AND RECYCLE HANDLING OCCURS. OTHER NECESSARY FUNCTIONS, SUCH AS ELECTRICAL CLOSETS, BIKE STORAGE, FIRE SPRINKLER ROOMS, ALL OF THAT KIND OF STUFF IS AT THIS LEVEL AS WELL. THIS IS THE SECOND FLOOR. AGAIN, SAME ORGANIZATION AS THE FIRST FLOOR. YOU'LL NOTICE THAT THERE ARE GRACIOUS DECKS AROUND THE BUILDING ON BOTH THE EAST AND THE WEST SIDES HERE, SO PEOPLE HAVE PLENTY OF OUTDOORSPACE AS BECAUSE WE DO GET A FEW NICE DAYS HERE. THE UPPER TWO FLOORS STEP BACK FROM THE FLOORS ON THE WEST TO THE FLOORS BELOW, WHICH REDUCES THE DWELLING COUNT ON THE UPPER TWO FLOORS TO A -- TWO PER FLOOR, SO THERE'S A TOTAL OF TEN UNITS, TWO ON THE FIRST AND SECOND AND TWO ON THE THIRD AND FOURTH. THERE'S THIS EXPRESSED ELEMENT ABOVE THE FRONT DOORS. THAT'S THE VERTICAL CIRCULATION THROUGH THE BUILDING. THIS IS SHOWING WHERE THE GRADE DROPS DOWN AS YOU PROCEED WEST ON SUMMIT TO GET TO THAT ALLEY. YOU SEE THE LARGE OUTDOOR TERRACE, PATIOS, DECKS, FOR THE OUTDOOR LIVING SPACE. A SIMILAR FENESTRATION PATTERN. THERE IS A RED BROWN BRICK WITH LIMESTONE ACCENT AT THE FRONT ENTRY. THIS IS THE ALLEY LOOKING EAST. YOU SEE THE MAIN GARAGE DOOR ILLUSTRATION HERE OFF THE ALLEY, AND YOU SEE THE OVERHEAD DOOR HERE FOR ROLLING OUT THE REFUSE BINS, AND THIS IS A COLORING RENDERING OF THE SAME COLOR ELEVATION OF THE SAME SIDE OF THE BUILDING. THIS IS THE NORTH. THAT'S THE NORTH SIDE, AND THIS IS THE EAST SIDE. THE PROJECT IS PROPOSING A STORY STRUCTURE OVER A BASEMENT GARAGE, BECAUSE THAT'S THE SIZE OF THE PROJECT THAT'S REQUIRED TO REMOVE THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION ON THE SITE, WHICH GOES ABOUT 25, 26 FEET BELOW GRADE. THE PROPOSAL HERE IS TO REMOVE THAT ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION TO ABOUT BETWEEN ONE AND FOUR FEET BELOW THE BASEMENT LEVEL, SO ALL OF THAT CONTAMINATED SOIL, WHICH WAS FROM YEARS AS A COAL GASIFICATION SITE -- WE'LL REMOVE THAT, PUT PERMEABLE MEMBRANE DOWN AND SUBSLAB DEPRESSURIZATION SYSTEM SO THAT MUCH OF THE CONTAMINATION IS GONE, AND WHAT REMAINS IS CAPPED, SO THAT WATER CANNOT INFILTRATE AND PUSH THAT CONTAMINATION AROUND THROUGH THE REST OF THE CITY, SO THERE'S A DEFINITE COMMUNITY BENEFIT IN THE REMOVAL OF THAT ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION, AND THEN I JUST WANTED TO HAND OUT TO EVERYBODY, THESE ARE ADDITIONAL LETTERS OF SUPPORT FROM NEIGHBORS AND PROPERTY OWNERS. IT DIDN'T MAKE IT ON TO LEGISTAR UNTIL I THINK MAYBE THIS MORNING. [ OFF MIC ].
01:25:18.004: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  AND THESE WERE IN OUR PACKETS.
01:25:21.842: >> I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU GET THAT. AND I'M HERE TONIGHT WITH A CIVIL ENGINEER AND ALSO A COUPLE OF THE OWNERS REPRESENTATIVES. SO IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
01:25:34.053: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  THANK YOU. WE'LL NOW MOVE ON TO MS. THATCHER FOR THE STAFF REPORT.
01:25:39.826: >> MOST OF WHAT I WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT, JUST BRIEFLY, IS THE ZONING REQUEST. THE PROPERTY IS REQUESTED TO BE REZONED FROM C1B TO C1A, FROM COMMUNITY CONVENIENCE CENTER TO CAMPUS BUSINESS DISTRICT. THE MAJOR DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO ARE THE FLOOR AREA RATIO WHICH IS ALLOWED. THEY ARE REQUESTING TO GO FROM 150 TO 200% -- I'LL GET TO THE CONDITIONS IN A SECOND -- AND THE HEIGHT DIFFERENTIAL IS FOUR STORIES AND 50 FEET UNDER THE EXISTING ZONING, AND THE PROPOSED ZONING HAS NO MAXIMUM HEIGHT. HOWEVER, THIS PROJECT HAS PROPOSED CONDITIONS TO BE PLACED ON THEIR REZONING WITH A MAXIMUM HEIGHT OF FOUR STORIES AND 65 FEET. THE HIGHEST ELEVATION IS LIMITED TO 850 FEET ABOVE SEA LEVEL, JUST ANOTHER WAY TO LOOK AT PRETTY MUCH THE SAME THING, AND THE PARCEL IS LIMITED TO A FLOOR AREA RATIO OF 199% INSTEAD OF 200%. RIGHT NOW, IT'S COMING IN AT 196%, AND SO THIS WOULD GIVE THEM A LITTLE BIT OF WIGGLE ROOM, BOTH IN TERMS OF HEIGHT. IT PROBABLY GIVES THEM AN EXTRA FIVE FEET TO PLAY AROUND WITH, IF THEY NEED IT, AND AN EXTRA -- WELL, ONE LESS PERCENTAGE. THIS IS A LITTLE, LITTLE SITE. IT'S 8571 SQUARE FEET. IF THIS WERE IN A RESIDENTIAL ZONING DISTRICT FOR TWO FAMILIES, IT WOULDN'T BE BIG ENOUGH FOR A TWO-FAMILY DWELLING, FOR A DUPLEX, BUT IT'S IN A COMMERCIAL ZONING DISTRICT, AND THE ENTIRE BLOCK IS ZONED COMMERCIALLY. IT IS CONSISTENT ON THIS BLOCK, AND STAFF CERTAINLY THINKS THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE PLACE FOR REDEVELOPMENT. IT'S CLOSE TO TRAINS, DOWNTOWN, THE HOSPITAL. IT'S CLOSE TO A LOT OF THINGS THAT YOU CAN WALK OR BIKE TO. REALLY THE ONLY THING THAT STAFF STRUGGLED WITH WAS THE HEIGHT. THE REST OF THE BLOCK WILL REMAIN CAPPED AT A 50-FOOT HEIGHT LIMIT, WHERE THIS ONE IS REQUESTED TO GO UP TO 65 FEET. THEY WOULD BOTH BE FOUR STORIES. THE REASON THIS ONE GOT BIGGER IS IT IS BUILT INTO THE HILL AND THE GARAGE LEVEL. HEY, BRAD, COULD YOU DO ME A FAVOR AND BRING ME THE MOUSE? THE GARAGE LEVEL IS MORE EXPOSED, SO THE BUILDING IS TALLEST ON -- THANK YOU -- ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SITE. I HAVE GOT A LOT OF SITE PLANS, THINGS, I HAVE GOT A LOT OF PICTURES IN HERE, BUT I JUST WANTED TO POINT OUT, SO ON THE EAST ELEVATION, THIS IS ABOUT A 50-FOOT TALL BUILDING. THIS IS WHAT YOU WOULD GET UNDER THE CURRENT ZONING, PLUS IT ALLOWS MORE FLOOR AREA AND REDUCED SETBACKS. IT'S THE OTHER END OF THE BUILDING HERE, WITH THE FWRAJ LEVEL, WHERE IT GETS TALLER. IT IS 60 FEET. OF COURSE, THE AVERAGE GRADE IS TAKEN AROUND THE BUILDING FOR EACH OF THE FOUR SIDES, BECAUSE IT IS BUILT INTO A SLOPE, SO ALL OF THE NUMBERS ARE ON THERE. THEY ALL WORK OUT, SO THE AVERAGE HEIGHT, I BELIEVE, THAT'S REPORTED IS EVEN LESS THAN 60 FEET. IT'S 56 FEET, 6.75 INCHES. BUT, YOU KNOW, FROM HERE TO HERE IS 60 FEET. ON THIS ELEVATION. SO THAT WAS REALLY THE ONLY THING THAT STAFF STRUGGLED WITH. THE PROJECT IS PROPOSED TO HAVE A GREEN ROOF. THAT'S A GOOD THING, HAS GREAT ACCESS, AND SO, REALLY, PLANNING STAFF ENDED UP OKAY WITH IT. KEEP IN MIND, THOUGH, THAT THE REST OF THIS BLOCK IS GOING TO BE LOOKING AT WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THIS PROJECT, AND THEY WILL BE VERY INTERESTED IN THAT, I AM SURE, BUT STAFF DOES RECOMMEND THAT BOTH THE ZONING PETITION AND THE SITE PLAN BE APPROVED. THANK YOU.
01:29:32.692: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  THANK YOU. AT THIS TIME, I WOULD LIKE TO OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING. IS THERE ANYONE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO WISHES TO ADDRESS THE COMMISSION IN REGARDS TO THIS PROJECT? IF SO, PLEASE STEP UP TO THE PODIUM, STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS FOR THE RECORD.
01:29:51.010: >> I LIVE AT 18 HEATHER RIDGE. I AM NOT SURE IF I'M GOING TO PICK UP ON THIS PROJECT OR NOT, BUT I THINK ONE ISSUE THAT FOR THIS PROJECT OR OTHER PROJECTS IS HAVING A SPOT IN THESE DAYS FOR PICK UP FROM THIS BUILDING. WE PERMITTED MANY PLACES. IT'S UBER DAYS AND LYFT AND DELIVERIES, AND THERE IS NO PLACE FOR A CAR TO STOP BY FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES. YOU HAVE TO STOP BY IN THE ROAD AND FLASH YOUR LIGHTS. I'M NOT SURE IF THIS APPLIES TO THIS PROJECT OR NOT, BUT I THINK FOR THIS PROJECT AND OTHER PROJECTS THAT YOU MIGHT LOOK AT IN THE FUTURE, ON HURON ROAD, WE HAVE MULTISTORY BUILDINGS. THERE IS NO PLACE TO PICK UP SOMEBODY. IF I HAVE TO PICK UP MY DAUGHTER, I HAVE TO STOP ON THE STREET AND FLASH MY LIGHTS, AND I'M CONCERNED ABOUT SOMEBODY HITTING ME IN THE BACK. SO IF THIS APPLIES, I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE A PLACE FOR A CAR TO COME AROUND OR -- AND PICK UP OR FOR DELIVERY.
01:30:52.271: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION?
01:30:56.909: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  JUST TO ADDRESS THE COMMENT BEFORE THIS, IF THERE WAS GOING TO BE AN UBER OR LYFT DRIVER, THEY COULD STOP IN THE ALLEY, WHICH WOULD BE OFF THE STREET. AND JOE, COULD YOU PULL UP THE AREA MAP AGAIN REAL QUICK? JUST FOR CONTEXT, JUST NORTH-ISH FROM OUR SITE IS THE M TRACK STATION, SO YOU COULD LITERALLY WALK HALF A BLOCK FROM THIS BUILDING AND PICK UP YOUR   TAX UBER OR LYFT RIGHT THERE AT THE AMTRAK STATION. SO FOR THIS TT'S AN EASY ANSWER, THAT DRIVERS COULD PICK UP PEOPLE IN THE ALLEY, OR A RESIDENT COULD WALK JUST ACROSS THAT ALLEY TO THE AMTRAK STATION FOR PICKUP. THANKS.
01:31:43.419: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION? ALL RIGHT. SEEING NO ONE, I WILL CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING, AND I WILL READ THE TWO MOTIONS BEFORE US. MOTION NUMBER ONE, THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION RECOMMENDS THAT THE -- AND RECOMMENDED COMMERCIAL OFFICE LAND USE DESIGNATION AND ACCEPT THESE CONDITIONS. ONE, THE MAXIMUM BUILDING EIGHT IS FOUR STORIES AND 65 FEET. NUMBER TWO, THE HIGHEST ELEVATION IS LIMITED TO ELEVATION OF 850 FETAL -- FEET. NUMBER THREE, THE PARCEL IS LIMITED TO A FLOOR AREA RATIO, F.A.R. OF 199%. THE APPROVAL IS SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL STATEMENT OF CONDITIONS. PETITION NUMBER TWO, THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION HEREBY RECOMMENDS THAT THE MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL APPROVE THE GARNET SITE PLAN AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT. MOVED BY COMMISSIONER MILLS, SECOND BY COMMISSIONER TRUDEAU, AND IF IT'S OKAY, WE'LL ADDRESS BOTH OF THE PETITIONS AT THE SAME TIME. WITHOUT OBJECTION, ALL RIGHT. COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN?
01:32:50.920: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN:  THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR. FIRST OF ALL, I'LL SAY THANKS TO TALKING TO YOUR NEIGHBORS. A LOT OF FAMILIAR NAMES IN YOUR LETTERS FROM THESE FOLKS. I GREW UP NEXT TO MIKE MONOHAN, SO I APPRECIATE THE DILIGENCE IN TALKING TO THE FOLKS THAT YOU'LL BE BUILDING AROUND. THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT ALWAYS HAPPENS AT THIS TABLE, SO WE ARE -- SO KNOW I'M GRATEFUL FOR THAT. GENERALLY, I LIKE THIS PROJECT. I THINK THE SCALE IS APPROPRIATE AND IS VERY NEARLY IDENTICAL TO THE CURRENT ZONING. WE SEE A SLIGHT INCREASE IN THE DENSITY AND, YOU KNOW, A MAXIMUM OF ABOUT TEN FEET-ISH TALLER THAN WE MIGHT ALLOW OTHERWISE, DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU ARE ON THE SITE. I THINK THE PARKING IS ADEQUATE FOR TEN UNITS, AND CERTAINLY THE BIKE PARKING EXCEEDS EXPECTATIONS. THE GREEN ROOF IS A HUGE PLUS IN THE ADDITION OF ANY STORM WATER MANAGEMENT ON SITE, WHICH IT CURRENTLY HAS NONE, IS ESPECIALLY APPRECIATED IN THAT PROXIMITY TO THE RIVER AND TO THE VERY SLOPING AREA. I APPRECIATE THE PARKING ENTRANCE AND EXIT IS THROUGH THE ALLEY. I THINK THIS IS AN AREA THAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO TRAVERSE, WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE IN A CAR OR YOU'RE ON A BIKE OR YOU'RE ON FOOT, SO I APPRECIATE NOT INCREASING THE NUMBER OF CURB CUTS, AND I HAVE A STRONG FEELING STAFF WOULDN'T HAVE LET YOU, EVEN IF YOU WANTED TO. WITH THAT, THAT KIND OF LEADS TO SOME AREAS OF QUESTION I HAVE, PARTICULARLY AROUND HOW PEOPLE GET AROUND IN THIS AREA. IT IS A SLIGHTLY DIFFICULT AREA TO GET AROUND, BY FOOT, BIKE, AND CAR, JUST IN THAT THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES TO TURN IN THE AREA, AND I WAS CURIOUS WHAT, IF ANY, THOUGHTS TRAFFIC OR ENGINEERING HAD ON SITE LINES, PARTICULARLY AS YOU COME AROUND BEACHER SUMMIT OR ACROSS THE BRIDGE.
01:35:09.291: >> FROM A STAFF PERSPECTIVE, WHEN TRAFFIC ENGINEERING CHECKED IT OUT, THEY HAD NO CONCERNS.
01:35:14.230: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN:  OKAY. THANK YOU. WITH RESPECT TO THE PICKUP COMMERCIAL, YOU KNOW, THE UBER LYFT IS GOING TO BE RELATIVELY SHORT. THERE'S A LOT OF STREETSIDE PARKING, A LOT OF WHICH IS PERMITTED, SO I DO UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN. I WOULD BE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT POTENTIAL PICKUP AND DROP-OFF, AND BY THAT, I MEAN U.P.S. TRUCKS AND THE LIKE. WHAT'S THE WIDTH OF THE ALLEY, AND WOULD THERE BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR COMMERCIAL TRUCKS TO PULL OFF INTO THE ALLEY? [ OFF-MICROPHONE COMMENT ]
01:36:05.347: >> THE ALLEY RIGHT-OF-WAY IS 33 FEET. I BELIEVE THE PAVING IS 17?
01:36:11.453: >> 15. IT'S A ONE-WAY. IT'S NORTHBOUND ONLY.
01:36:15.891: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN:  GOT IT. SO, THE ALLEY IS ONE WAY. DO YOU EXPECT AN UBER OR LYFT DRIVER OR UPS TRUCK DRIVER TO KNOW THAT? I'M NOT PARTICULARLY CONCERNED, BUT IT WAS RAISED BY A MEMBER -- OKAY. YEAH, NO, THE WAY PEOPLE GET AROUND TOWN IS CHANGING, AND DROP-OFF IS -- AND PICKUP IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO DISCUSS MORE AND MORE. WHERE THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES, I THINK WE TRIED TO PUSH FOR THOSE CHANGES, SO IT WAS A LONG CONVERSATION AROUND, OH, WHAT WAS IT, THE GLENN HOTEL IN PARTICULAR, RIGHT IN THE SAME AREA, ABOUT THAT VERY SAME I ISSUE. SO, I APPRECIATE THAT FOCUS. I GUESS, FINALLY, ON THE CONTAMINATION, I WAS READING THROUGH THE CITIZENS PARTICIPATION MEETING. IT SOUNDS LIKE D.T.E., BEING THE RESPONSIBLE PARTY, IS GOING TO PAY FOR THE CLEANUP. I WAS CURIOUS HOW, THROUGH WHAT FUNCTION THAT HAPPENS.
01:37:20.822: >> SO THEY ARE GOING TO BE INVOLVED IN THE CLEANUP WHETHER -- I DON'T KNOW THAT THEY WILL PAY THE WHOLE THING. THAT'S STILL A BACK AND FORTH NEGOTIATION ISSUE. THEYAN REPLACE THE TREES, BUT THERE'S SOME NEGOTIATION GOING ON FOR WHAT THEY WILL COVER AND WHAT THEY WON'T COVER, BUT THEY ARE GOING TO BE INVOLVED DEFINITELY.
01:37:50.883: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN:  OKAY. LIKE I SAID, I DON'T HAVE A LARGE AMOUNT OF CONCERN ABOUT THIS. I APPRECIATE THAT YOU TALKED TO YOUR NEIGHBORS. I SEE THIS AS, YOU KNOW, LOW TO MID DENSITY, AN INCREASE IN HOUSING, ALTHOUGH MARKET RATE FOR SALE AND PROBABLY EXPENSIVE CONDOS, BUT I THINK IT FITS WITHIN THE CHARACTER OF THE AREA AND CERTAINLY -- CERTAINLY THE IMMEDIATE NEIGHBORS. THANKS.
01:38:24.750: >> MAYOR TAYLOR:  COMMISSIONER MILLS?
01:38:28.487: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  I JUST WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT, WITH THE CONTAMINATION. SO ARE YOU SEEKING BROWNFIELD FUNDING FOR THIS?
01:38:35.094: >> NO, WE DON'T. THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY.
01:38:37.396: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  OKAY. AND THE REASON THAT I ASK IN PART IS BECAUSE ONE OF THE JUSTIFICATIONS FOR UP-ZONING, WHICH I'M IN FAVOR OF, BY THE WAY, IS TO MAKE THIS VIABLE TO BE ABLE TO CLEANUP, AND SO THAT'S KIND OF DOUBLE DIPPING, JUST TO PUT THAT ON THE RECORD, THAT IF YOU SEEK THE BROWNFIELD FUNDS AND HAVE THE -- I'M CURIOUS ABOUT HOW MUCH IS ON TAXPAYERS, VERSUS NOT.
01:38:59.484: >> TAXPAYERS, ZERO.
01:39:03.522: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  SOMETHING THAT I NOTICED -- THE OTHER DAY, THE COMING UP DIVISION, IS THAT THE EASTERN FACADE OF THIS IS GOING TO BE HIGHLY VISIBLE. WHEN YOU'RE COMING ON TO DIVISION BEFORE LOOKING AT THE BROADWAY BRIDGE, YOU ARE LOOKING STRAIGHT AT THIS. FROM MOST PERSPECTIVES, YOU DON'T IMAGINE HOW HIGHLY VISIBLE THIS WOULD BE. CAN YOU TALK US THROUGH -- THE FRONT OF THE BUILDING IS ONE THAT NOT TONS AND TONS OF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SEE. I LIKE IT AND THE GLASS. CAN YOU TALK US THROUGH THIS AND WHY THIS IS THE BEAUTIFUL FACE AND WHY I MIGHT COLOR THIS FOR GOING TO COUNCIL, BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT PEOPLE WILL SEE.
01:39:47.699: >> SO, AGAIN, WE TRIED TO CREATE A LOT OF OUTDOOR LIVING SPACE, SO YOU'LL SEE ON THIS SIDE OF THE BUILDING, THERE ARE A LOT OF OUTDOOR PATIOS AND DECKS, AND IT'S ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE BUILDING, SO YOU'LL HAVE A LOT OF BEAUTIFUL MORNING LIGHT, AS WELL AS SOFTENING THE IMPACT OF THE BUILDING. THAT IS TO SAY THAT THE FACE OF THE BUILDING ISN'T THE FIRST THING YOU'LL ENCOUNTER. IT'S THE BALCONIES AND THE RAILINGS, SO IT'S KIND OF A MITIGATING BUFFER, SO TO SPEAK, BETWEEN THE PEDESTRIANWAY OR MOTORWAY IN THIS CASE, AND THE FACE OF THE BUILDING. WHERE IT PRESENTED A TALLER FACE ON THE WEST SIDE, AS JILL INDICATED, WE TRIED TO STEP IT BACK TO MITIGATE IT IN THAT WAY ON THE WEST SIDE, SO WE ARE TRYING DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO SOFTEN THE BUILDING EDGES OR FRONTS, DEPENDING ON YOUR VIEWPOINT.
01:40:38.984: >> SO IT'S GOING TO LOOK -- I WAS ACTUALLY GOING TO ASK WHAT'S GOING ON WITH ALL OF THOSE SQUARES TO COLOR THE EAST SIDE, SO THIS IS THE WEST SPACE THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT. BUT IT'S SIMILAR IN THAT THAT YOU HAVE ALL OF THOSE SQUARES ARE PATIO DOORS SURROUNDED BY WINDOWS, ALL AROUND.
01:40:59.538: >> CORRECT.
01:40:59.871: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  GOT IT. I THINK THAT'S ATTRACTIVE, BUT JUST SO PEOPLE KNOW, THIS IS WHAT I THINK MOST PEOPLE WILL SEE ABOUT IT, AND AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT, I'M GOING TO ASK ABOUT BICYCLE PARKING, BECAUSE YOU DO EXCEED THE MINIMUM, BUT THE MINIMUM REQUIRED IS TWO FOR TEN RESIDENTS THIS YEAR, AND THIS IS A STONE'S THROW FROM THE B2B. I LIVED KITTY-CORNER ACROSS THE STREET ON BEAKS. LIKE, THIS IS A FANTASTIC PLACE. IT'S TRICKY, DON'T GET ME WRONG, TO GET PEOPLE TO STOP FOR YOU TO CROSS BEAKS SOMETIMES, BUT THIS IS A FANTASTIC PLACE FOR PEOPLE TO CYCLE, SO WHY ONLY THREE BICYCLE PARKING SPOTS?
01:41:40.478: >> SO THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY -- ONE OF THE OPTIONS THAT EVERY PURCHASER WILL HAVE IS BICYCLE PARKING OVER THE HOOD OF THEIR CAR IN THE GARAGE LEVEL. THAT'S GOING TO BE UP TO THE PURCHASER, AND THEY WILL ALSO BE ABLE TO STORE IT WITHIN THEIR UNIT.
01:41:59.898: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  I'M NOT SOLD. I DON'T THINK PEOPLE ARE GOING TO DO THAT. IF THIS IS ACTUALLY A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE CAN CYCLE TO WORK, WALK TO WORK, I DON'T THINK THEY ARE GOING TO PUT IT UP OVER THE HOOD OF THEIR CAR EVERY DAY, AND SO I'M NOT SOLD ON THAT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE SOLUTION IS, BUT I KNOW THAT THAT'S WHAT THIS ZONING HERE CALLS FOR, BUT THIS IS A PARTICULAR PLACE WHERE PEOPLE WILL CYCLE, AND THE OTHER QUESTION OR COMMENT THAT I HAVE IS THIS IS A PLACE WHERE THERE'S NOT MUCH TO HOOK TO ON THE SIDEWALK, LIKE FOR VISITORS, SO WHERE ARE VISITORS GOING TO PUT THEIR BICYCLES? BECAUSE, AGAIN, IT'S SO CLOSE TO THINGS. ARE THERE HOOPS? I...
01:42:57.388: >> AS WAS POINTED OUT, WE COULD ADD VISITOR HOOPS DOWN IN THIS CORNER HERE.
01:43:02.426: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  SO, BUT VISITORS ARE GOING TO BE COMING FROM SUMMIT. THEY ARE NOT -- YOU COULD ADD IT DOWN THERE, BUT I THINK THAT THEY ARE NEVER GOING TO KNOW THAT IT IS THERE. SO I MEAN, I THINK WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET INSTEAD IS PEOPLE LOCKING IT TO MAYBE THE LIKE -- I DON'T -- THE FENCE THAT WE ARE SEEING RIGHT HERE. YEAH, LIKE SOMETHING UP THERE, I THINK YOU NEED TO HAVE A HOOP ON SUMMIT STREET.
01:43:29.788: >> OKAY.
01:43:33.958: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  YEAH.
01:43:38.797: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN: COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN?
01:43:40.364: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN:  YEAH, IF I COULD QUICKLY JUMP IN HERE, THIS IS WHY YOU PAY ATTENTION TO THE STAFF REPORT AND NOT THE CITIZEN PARTICIPATION MEETING MINUTES. I THINK THERE MIGHT BE A TYPO IN THE CITIZEN PARTICIPATION MEETING MINUTES, WHERE IT SAYS 30 BIKES. SO THERE MAY BE A TYPO IN WHAT YOU SUBMITTED. I AGREE WITH COMMISSIONER MILLS THAT IT WOULD BE GOOD TO FIND SOME MORE BIKE PARKING.
01:44:09.894: >> JUST TO ADD TO THAT, LIBERTY LOTS OF, THERE'S 68 UNITS, AND THERE'S AT LEAST 30 PARKING SPOTS IN OUR INDOOR PARKING STORAGE, SO THAT'S PROBABLY ABOUT HALF OF THE RESIDENTS HAVE BIKES IN THE BUILDINGS. -- IN THE BUILDING.
01:44:29.480: >> COMMISSIONER WEATHERBEE?
01:44:30.715: >> COMMISSIONER WEATHERBEE:  I THINK IT LOOKS GREAT, EVEN THOUGH I AM ALWAYS A PROPONENT OF A FRONT DOOR ON THE MAIN STREET, I THINK SUMMIT IS CLOSE ENOUGH ON THE MAIN STREET TO THIS TO QUALIFY, AND I THINK IT LOOKS GOOD. I ALSO HAD COMMENTS ON THE BIKE PARKING, AND I WOULD ALSO AGREE WITH THE SPEAKER FROM THE AUDIENCE ABOUT STOPPING. I LIVE, AS YOU KNOW, NEAR 615 SOUTH MAIN, AND WHILE THERE IS A GREAT PULLOUT SPOT FOR PEOPLE HALF A BLOCK DOWN THE WAY, NO CAR EVER DRIVES THERE. THEY PARK RIGHT NEXT TO THE BUILDING, AND RIGHT NEXT TO THE ENTRY, AND SO RIGHT NEXT TO THE ENTRY IS WHERE YOU GET ALL OF THE BIKES, AND RIGHT NEXT TO THE ENTRY IS WHERE YOU GET ALL OF THE PULL UP, AND SO I DO THINK THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT THAT, AND I REALIZE THAT THAT'S NOT -- YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE CAN DO ABOUT THAT AT THIS POINT, BUT PEOPLE WILL NOT WALK DOWN AND AROUND. THEY JUST -- THEY JUST WON'T, AND -- OR THEY DO NOT NOW, AND SO I KNOW THAT AT 615, WHAT HAPPENS IS CARS JUST STACK UP IN THE PARKING LOT OF THE GAS STATION NEXT DOOR, AND SO THERE WILL BE FIVE, SIX, SEVEN CARS. THERE'S DELIVERY DRIVERS. THERE'S UBER AND LYFT, THAT JUST STACK UP WITHIN TEN FEET OF THE FRONT DOOR, AND SO MY ASSUMPTION IS THIS IS CERTAINLY FEWER PEOPLE, SO IT'S NOT GOING TO BE THAT KIND OF INTENSITY, BUT I THINK IT'S A REALLY GOOD POINT THAT WE NEED TO NOT JUST ASSUME THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO WALK A BLOCK, EVEN IF IT'S SUPER CONVENIENT, AND BIKE PARKING, ALSO PEOPLE SIMPLY PUT THEIR BIKES BY THE FRONT DOOR, BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE WE ARE GOING TO COME IN AND OUT, AND THEY ARE NOT GOING TO WHEEL IT AROUND TO THE SAFE SPOT IN THE BASEMENT AND LIFT IT UP OVER THEIR HEAD WHEN THEY ARE JUST RUNNING IN AND OUT, SO I THINK WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING, ESPECIALLY WITH THE BIKE PARKING, AND JUST UNDERSTAND THAT SORT OF SAYING, OH, THERE'S CONVENIENT PULLOUT SPOTS SOMEWHERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD IS NOT GOING TO CUT IT FOR DELIVERY AND PICKUP SPACES. I ALSO HAD A QUESTION ABOUT THE REFUSE IN RELATION TO THE NEIGHBORS, AND I REALIZE THAT THE CURRENT AND FUTURE NEIGHBORS MAY BE VERY DIFFERENT, BUT CAN YOU KIND OF DESCRIBE HOW THAT REFUSE AREA WORKS?
01:47:06.136: >> SO, THERE'S AN OVERHEAD DOOR THAT ALLOWS ACCESS TO THE REFUSE FOR THE RECYCLE LOCATION. ON THE PICKUP DAYS, THE CART IS ROLLED OUT HERE FOR THE COLLECTION OF THE TRUCKS, THAT WE ARE TOLD ARE GOING TO COME THIS WAY, THIS WAY, AND THIS WAY, TO PICK IT UP, AND KATHY HAS BEEN WORKING WITH THE REFUSE COLLECTION.
01:47:32.930: >> COMMISSIONER WEATHERBEE:  SO DO THE RESIDENTS DO THE GARBAGE FROM INSIDE OR OUTSIDE? OKAY. SO IT STAYS IN THERE, AND ON REFUSE DAY, IT COMES OUT, SITS THERE FOR AN HOUR OR WHATEVER, AND SOMEBODY WILL BE WHEELING IT BACK IN?
01:47:45.042: >> AND THEN THAT AREA IS AVAILABLE FOR [ OFF MIC ] --
01:47:51.181: >> COMMISSIONER WEATHERBEE:  [ LAUGHTER ] THERE YOU GO. OKAY. THANK YOU. AND THEN I HAD ONE OTHER THAT MAY BE FOR STAFF, AND SO HAVING JUST WALKED OVER THERE THE OTHER DAY, IN THAT AREA, SO KERRY STREET, IT'S A COMBINATION OF SUMMIT, KERRY, HIGH STREETS ALL KIND OF COME TOGETHER, AND THERE ARE CROSSWALKS ON SOME BUT NOT ALL OF THOSE STREETS, SO I GOT STUCK COMING DOWN I GUESS IT WAS KERRY STREET, AND THEN YOU COULDN'T -- THERE ACTUALLY WASN'T A CROSSWALK THAT WOULD GET YOU OVER TO THE CROSSWALK THAT WOULD GET YOU TO SUMMIT, AND I'M LOOKING AT A MAP HERE, SO IT'S A LITTLE EASIER FOR ME TO SAY THAT, BUT THERE ARE SOME KIND OF LIKE CROSSWALK GAPS HERE THAT I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S SOMETHING THAT WE COULD ADDRESS SO THAT -- BECAUSE, PRESUMABLY, PEOPLE IN THIS -- IN THIS BUILDING WOULD POTENTIALLY CROSS TO GO OVER TO THE HOSPITAL. I THINK THAT'S A PRETTY REASONABLE ASSUMPTION FOR THIS BUILDING, AND THERE ISN'T REALLY A WAY TO DO IT THAT INCLUDES A CROSSWALK ON EVERY -- AT EVERY POINT, SO I JUST DON'T KNOW -- I KNOW THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF CROSSWALK WORK DONE HERE.
01:49:17.467: >> YEAH, SO COMMISSIONER WEATHERBEE, YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WHEN YOU GO UPHILL ON KERRY, YOU CAN'T GET TO THIS ISLAND FROM RIGHT HERE, CORRECT? BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO WALK ALL THE WAY AROUND. YOU HAVE TO GO AROUND THE CURVE HERE, AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF SIGHT LINES. CARS FLY AROUND THAT CORNER, AND IF YOU'RE A PEDESTRIAN IN THE CROSSWALK, IT'S NOT SAFE, BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO WALK -- YOU HAVE TO WALK FARTHER.
01:49:43.027: >> COMMISSIONER WEATHERBEE:  YOU COULDN'T SEE FARTHER UP, YOU DON'T REALIZE THAT IT'S GOING TO DISAPPEAR.
01:49:51.802: >> PEOPLE DASH ACROSS THERE ALL THE TIME, BUT YOU'RE RIGHT THAT IT'S NOT A SAFE PLACE BECAUSE THERE'S NOT A SAFE PLACE FOR A CROSSWALK. SO THERE'S A NEW ONE, YOU HAVE TO GO UP, CROSS, DOWN, AND THEN THERE'S A SERIES OF CROSSWALKS HERE, HERE, AND HERE ACROSS BEAKS. SO IT'S NOT THE MOST CONVENIENT, BUT IT'S TO TRY TO STEER PEOPLE AWAY FROM THE DOWNHILL TRAFFIC ON DIVISION AND TAKING THEM ON KERRY OR HIGH TOO QUICKLY.
01:50:22.933: >> COMMISSIONER WEATHERBEE:  I UNDERSTAND THAT, BUT IT'S LIKE SAYING PEOPLE ARE GOING TO WALK HALF A BLOCK TO PICK UP THEIR LYFT. I WOULD JUST LIKE TO REGISTER THAT I THINK THAT'S NOT A GOOD SITUATION, AND I UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S BEEN TRICKY TO KIND OF FIGURE THAT OUT, BUT THERE IS NOTHING THAT SAYS AS YOU ARE WALKING DOWN DIVISION, AS YOU ARE KIND OF GETTING TO KERRY STREET, THAT SAYS IF YOU WANT TO GET ACROSS THE STREET, YOU NEED TO CROSS HERE. YOU JUST ARE WALKING ALONG THE SIDEWALK, AND THEN THERE'S NO PLACE TO CROSS SAFELY. SO, EVEN IF THERE COULD BE SOME SIGNAGE OR SOMETHING THAT SAYS, YOU KNOW, TO CROSS, CROSS HERE, DON'T TRY TO KEEP GOING, BECAUSE THERE IS NOTHING AS A PEDESTRIAN TO INDICATE THAT.
01:51:07.678: >> YEAH.
01:51:12.582: >> COMMISSIONER WEATHERBEE:  AND I REALIZE THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE PROJECT'S SITUATION, BUT I DO THINK IT WILL AFFECT THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE THERE.
01:51:25.796: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN: COMMISSIONER SAUVE?
01:51:27.798: >> COMMISSIONER SAUVE:  I THINK THIS IS A TRICKY SITE, AND THERE ARE DEFINITELY -- YOU KNOW, I SUPPORT THE KIND OF VARIANCES TO MAKE THESE MANEUVERS WORK, BECAUSE LIKE I SAID, EVEN TWO SINGLE-FAMILY HOMES WOULD BE DIFFICULT ON THIS, SO GETTING SOMETHING OUT OF IT I THINK IS A BENEFIT. I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING -- BRAD, COULD YOU CLARIFY THE BROWNFIELD ECONOMICS, JUST SO WE KNOW ABOUT THE LIMITS TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING, BECAUSE I THINK WHAT YOU SAID WAS YOU NEEDED TO MAKE THE TEN UNITS AND THE SCALE TO MAKE THE ECONOMICS WORK BECAUSE OF THE CLEANUP, AND THEN THERE WERE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS RAISED ABOUT WHO WAS DOING THE CLEANUP AND THAT COST, SO I JUST WANTED TO UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT BROWNFIELD AND THE ECONOMICS TO CLARIFY, YOU KNOW, WHAT TYPE OF UNITS WE ARE GETTING AND WHY.
01:52:18.281: >> SO THE CONTAMINATED SOIL IS CLEARLY AS A RESULT OF THE PREVIOUS ACTIVITIES ON THE SITE, COAL GASIFICATION. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE'S A SIMILAR JOINT EFFORT THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE PROPOSED PROJECT OVER BY THE RIVER, WHERE DTE ESSENTIALLY, IN LAYMEN'S TERMS, AGREES TO CLEAN IT UP TO AN INDUSTRIAL STANDARD, BECAUSE THAT WAS WITH THE HISTORIC USE OF THE PROPERTY, BUT THEN IN ORDER TO MAKE IT SAFE FOR RESIDENTS, THE DEVELOPER HAS TO DO THE REST OF THAT, WHICH IS PUTTING IN THE VAPOR BARRIERS, THE SUBSLAB DEPRESSURIZATION AND DOING THE MONITORING OF THE GROUNDWATER THAT IS SEEPING INTO THE DRAIN TILES, AS IN THE REPORT, TO ENSURE THERE IS NO CONTAMINATION GETTING INTO THE STORM SEWER SYSTEM. SO THAT'S WHY IT IS A MIXTURE OF PRIVATE COSTS AS WELL AS REMEDIATION COSTS FROM PREVIOUS LANDOWNER. SO IT'S NOT ALL GOING TO BE DONE BY DTE.
01:53:22.045: >> COMMISSIONER WEATHERBEE: THAT COST IN THE DEVELOPMENT IS WHAT'S TIPPING YOUR REQUIREMENT TO MAKE THE TEN-YEAR ACADEMICS WORK. I JUST WANTED TO SPELL OUT THE REQUIREMENT. WHILE WE ARE DEFINITELY IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING WITH TEN UNITS, IT IS DIFFICULT WHEN LOOKING AT TRICKY SITES LIKE THIS, SO I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WAS DISCUSSED. I REALLY ACTUALLY WISH THAT COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL WAS HERE TO TALK ABOUT THESE HONEY LOCUST TREES.
01:53:50.940: >> IF I MAY, I'M A MEMBER OF THE DEVELOPMENT TEAM. I THOUGHT I WOULD ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT ON THE QUESTION REGARDING CONTAMINATION IN HISTORIC BROWNFIELD.
01:54:00.049: >> CAN YOU STATE YOUR NAME FOR THE RECORD?
01:54:02.252: >> MY NAME IS VICTORIA PEBBLES, AND I'M A MEMBER OF THE DEVELOPMENT TEAM. AND I WANTED TO ADD THAT WE DID CONSIDER PURSUING THE BROWNFIELD PROGRAM, AND THEN WE WERE PUT IN CONTACT WITH THE D.T.E., AND WE DECIDED THAT IT WOULD BE IN THE BEST PUBLIC INTEREST TO ACTUALLY WORK WITH THEM DIRECTLY SO THAT WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO USE TAXPAYER DOLLARS, SO WE ARE -- THEY UNDERSTAND THAT THEY HAVE SOME RESPONSIBILITIES UNDER ACT 381 TO DO SOME CLEANUP, AND WE ARE JUST IN NEGOTIATION, AS BRAD NOTED, AND SO THAT NEGOTIATION IS ONGOING, WHAT IS THEIR RESPONSIBILITY, WHAT IS ABOVE AND BEYOND, WHAT WOULD THEY HAVE TO DO UNDER THE LAW, AND THEN WHAT ARE WE DO ASKING FOR THAT'S ABOVE AND BEYOND, AND SO WE ARE GOING THROUGH THAT RIGHT NOW, BUT WE ARE TRYING TO KEEP IT OUT OF GOING THROUGH USING THE TIFF PROGRAM, SO THAT WE CAN BASICALLY KEEP THIS BURDEN IN THE PRIVATE -- BETWEEN THE PRIVATE DEVELOPER AND THE HISTORIC USER THAT CREATED THE CONTAMINATION.
01:54:57.540: >> THANK YOU.
01:55:00.810: >> COMMISSIONER SAUVE:  THAT HELPS. SO I WANTED TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE SOUTHEAST CORNER, WITH THE HONEY LOCUSTS THAT ARE THERE. ONE IS 20% IN THE ROOT ZONE OF THE CORNER. I THINK THAT GOES TO THE CORNER OF THE BEAKS AND SUMMIT SITE THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT AS THE PERMANENT SITE, AND THAT THOSE WOULD HELP SOFTEN THAT FACADE A BIT. IS THERE ANY STRATEGY TO PROTECT THAT ANYMORE DURING CONSTRUCTION? BECAUSE THE FINAL BUILDING FOOTPRINT IS IN THAT ROOT ZONE, AND I WANTED TO KNOW IF THERE IS ANY ADDITIONAL CONSTRUCTION THAT WOULD IMPACT IT DURING THE PROCESS, AND THEN A REMEDIATION PLAN IF IT DOESN'T SURVIVE.
01:55:47.724: >> SO, KATHY WAS JUST EXPLAINING THAT ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION IS GOING TO TAKE OUT THOSE TREES. THERE WILL BE REMEDIATION ON SITE AND NEW TREES WILL BE PLANTED TO REPLACE THEM, BUT THE ROOTS ARE FIRMLY HOLDING A LOT OF THAT CONTAMINATION.
01:56:05.742: >> COMMISSIONER SAUVE:  OKAY. AND THEN, SO GARBAGE GOES THE WRONG WAY DOWN A ONE-WAY? NO? I GUESS THAT WAS HOW IT WAS DESCRIBED IN THE SITE WHEN WE POINTED TO WHICH DIRECTION. IT GOES THE SAME WAY AS THE ONE-WAY? OKAY. THAT'S ALL. I JUST WANTED TO CONFIRM WHICH WAY IT WAS, AS YOU WERE POINTING ON THE DRAWING VERSUS WHAT WE WERE DISCUSSING AS THE ONE-WAY. AND THEN I ALSO WANT TO SAY ABOUT THE BIKE STORAGE, EVEN JUST THE CONFIGURATION OF GETTING THOSE BIKES INTO THAT CORRAL IN THE LOWER LEVEL -- YEAH, JUST VERTICALLY PARKED, TURNING THAT CORNER AND TUCKING TWO IN THERE, THAT SEEMS INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT, LET ALONE KIND OF JUST FITTING THREE IN THERE. EVEN HAVING THOSE THREE USED, I'M HAVING A HARD TIME BELIEVING THAT THOSE WOULD EVEN BE USED IN THAT CONFIGURATION, SO I WOULD PUT ADDED PRESSURE ON THE COUNT AND CONFIGURATION OF THOSE BIKES IN THAT BIKE STORAGE. AND I THINK THAT'S IT.
01:57:08.905: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN: COMMISSIONER WOODS?
01:57:12.609: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS:  JUST A QUESTION ABOUT AN ITEM THAT CAME UP IN YOUR CITIZEN PARTICIPATION MEETING, AND IT'S RELATED TO THE ALLEY, AND SO I JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS, I THINK, FOR THE PETITIONER ABOUT THAT. JUST A QUESTION FOR YOU, SO HAS IT BEEN DETERMINED WHO THE   ALY BELONGS TO?
01:57:44.306: >> IT'S IN THE DEED FOR THE PROPERTY. EVERY CITY ASSESSOR'S MAP SINCE THE 1950s HAS SHOWN IT IS VACATED AND BELONGING TO OUR PROPERTY. THE PROBLEM WAS WHEN THE CITY ILLEGAL DEPARTMENT WENT BACK TO FIND THE -- LEGAL DEPARTMENT WENT BACK TO FIND THE RESOLUTION VACATING IT, THEY COULDN'T FIND THAT THERE WAS ADEQUATE DOCUMENTATION, SO THE POSITION OF THE LEGAL STAFF WAS SINCE THEY COULDN'T FIND A PROPER RECORDING OF A COUNCIL ACTION VACATING THE ALLEY THAT IT WASN'T VACATED.
01:58:17.339: >> OKAY.
01:58:19.008: >> SO, AT THIS POINT, THE CITY HAS TAKEN A POSITION THAT IT IS THEIRS, AND YOU CAN'T FIGHT CITY HALL, APPARENTLY, SO WE ARE NOT GOING TO FIGHT CITY HALL OVER THE OWNERSHIP OF THE ALLEY.
01:58:32.021: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS:  OKAY. AND SO THE QUESTION ABOUT THE ALLEY BEING REPAVED, WHAT ARE THE CONDITIONS OF THE ALLEY RIGHT NOW? IS THAT LIKE GRAVEL OR SOMETHING, OR IS IT JUST CEMENT?
01:58:41.330: >> IT'S BETTER THAN MOST ROADS IN ANN ARBOR. [ LAUGHTER ].
01:58:45.902: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS:  THAT DOESN'T MEAN MUCH [ LAUGHTER ] I DIDN'T REALLY SAY THAT OUT LOUD, BUT --
01:58:50.539: >> IT IS CURRENTLY ASPHALT PAVEMENT, AS I RECALL.
01:58:56.545: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS:  ASPHALT PAVEMENT, UH-HUH.
01:58:58.180: >> THERE ARE SOME CRACKS IN IT, BUT WE REALIZE OUR CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY IS GOING TO EXACERBATE THE CRACKS. WE PLAN ON REPAVING IT. IT IS THE LENGTH OF OUR PROPERTY, NOT FROM END TO END, BUT DURING THE DURATION OF OUR CONSTRUCTION, WE ARE GOING TO DEGRADE IT, SO WE ARE GOING TO REPLACE IT.
01:59:24.340: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS:  WOULDN'T THE HEAVY TRUCKS ALSO DEGRADE THE PART THAT GOES ON DOWN FROM THE ALLEY TO DEPOT STREET?
01:59:31.914: >> THE CONSTRUCTION MANAGER ASSURES US THAT SHE IS GOING TO HAVE ENOUGH CONTROL OVER WHO PARKS WHERE AND WHO USES IT THAT THAT WON'T HAPPEN, BUT WE WOULD CERTAINLY TAKE RESPONSIBILITY. IF WE DEGRADE THE ALLEY FROM OUR ACTIVITIES, WE'LL IMPROVE IT. WE'LL PHOTO DOCUMENT AND IF IT'S PROVEN THAT OUR GUYS DID IT, WE'LL REPLACE IT.
01:59:55.038: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS:  I GUESS OUR QUESTION FROM STAFF IS DO WE KNOW WHERE THIS ALLEY FALLS IN TERMS OF GETTING REPAVED OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT? I WOULD HATE FOR THE RESIDENTS TO COME OUT, AND YOU HAVE GOT A NICE ALLEY THAT YOU ARE ON, AND SUDDENLY YOU'RE FULL OF POTHOLES OR WHAT HAVE YOU.
02:00:15.491: >> I DO NOT KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT.
02:00:19.996: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS:  MAYBE EVEN BEFORE IT GETS TO CITY COUNCIL, I THINK THAT WOULD BE IMPORTANT, BECAUSE IF WE ARE GOING TO FIX UP AN AREA, THERE IS NO SENSE IN DOING IT HALFWAY.
02:00:33.442: >> WE ALWAYS PUT IT IN OUR ALLOCATIONS, SO IF WE ARE GUILTY OF DOING SOMETHING, WE'LL FIX IT.
02:00:42.651: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS:  AND I JUST WANTED TO INDICATE THAT I'M GLAD TO SEE THAT THIS AREA IS RECEIVING ATTENTION. IT IS, AS MANY HAVE ALREADY INDICATED, CLOSE TO DOWNTOWN AND EVERYTHING, AND, YOU KNOW, PARTS OF THIS WERE IN AN HISTORIC AREA FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS WHO LIVED IN THIS PARTICULAR AREA OF TOWN, AND SO THIS -- PERHAPS THIS WILL BE A PLACE WHERE A HISTORIC MARKER WILL GO UP OR SOMETHING, INDICATING THE PREVIOUS RESIDENTS OF THE AREA, AND I THINK IT ALSO IS THE BEGINNING OF OR PART OF ONE OF THE INDIAN TRAILS THAT KIND OF GOES UP PONTIAC TRAIL AS WELL, SO IT WOULD BE NICE TO SEE THOSE -- THAT KIND OF HISTORICAL INFORMATION THERE FOR THOSE WHO COME LATER ON, SO THANK YOU.
02:01:27.263: >> I WILL SUGGEST TO MY CLIENTS THEY CONSIDER A PLAQUE.
02:01:35.036: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS:  I WOULD APPRECIATE THAT.
02:01:38.241: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN: COMMISSIONER BRIGGS?
02:01:39.141: >> COMMISSIONER BRIGGS:  SO I AGREE WITH THE COMMENTS OF -- OVERALL, THE PROJECT LOOKS GREAT. IT'S WONDERFUL TO SEE THAT WE ARE NITPICKING OVER BICYCLE PARKING AND SEEING A GREAT BUILDING OUT THERE AND A GOOD LOCATION, AND THE SUPPORT FROM THE NEIGHBORS SEEMS WONDERFUL. IT LOOKS LIKE ONLY TEN PARKING SPACES ARE REQUIRED, IS THAT RIGHT, BUT 11 ARE BEING PROVIDED?
02:02:10.839: >> SO THE TYPICAL PARKING IN THE RATIO ARE ONE AND A HALF PER UNIT. IN COMMERCIAL, IT'S LESS. IT IS ONE PER DWELLING. BUT WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE SOME SPACES FOR GUEST PARKING.
02:02:26.888: >> I WOULD RATHER SEE THAT ADDITIONAL SPACE APPLIED TO BICYCLE PARKING, PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE REZONING REQUEST TO C1A, BUT AS SAID, THIS IS CLEARLY A DESTINATION, BECAUSE THE ZONING IS APPROPRIATE HERE, AND WHAT WE ARE SUGGESTING IS THAT IT IS ENTIRELY FOR WALKING AND BIKING, I THINK THE PARKING IN THE BUILDING SHOULD REALLY COMPLEMENT THAT USE, BECAUSE CURRENTLY IT DOESN'T, AND I DO AGREE THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE BICYCLE PARKING OUT FRONT FOR GUESTS TO BE -- OR RESIDENTS WHEN THEY ARE GOING INTO THE BUILDING, BUT THERE SHOULD BE APPROPRIATE BICYCLE PARKING WITHIN THE BUILDING, AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT, IF THERE'S -- UNLESS YOU HAVE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY FOR PROVIDING THAT WITHIN THE -- KEEPING THE 11 SPACES PLUS PROVIDING ADDITIONAL?
02:03:25.914: >> YEAH. KATHY AND I HAVE FOUND A SPOT WHERE WE CAN PUT SOME HOOPS ON THAT FRONT ENTRY WALK COMING UP. THERE'S ROOMS FOR TWO HOPS THERE, WHICH WOULD BE FOUR BIKES COMING UP TO THE ENTRY. ONE OF THE THINGS WE COULD DO IS USE A MACHINE ROOM LIFT ELEVATOR, WHICH WOULD ALLOW US TO GARNER BACK THE SPACE THAT'S CURRENTLY ALLOCATED IN THAT PLAN FOR AN ELEVATOR EQUIPMENT ROOM, AND I AM SURE WE COULD GET FOUR MORE VERTICALLY STORED BIKES THERE, AND I COULD PUT SOME HOOKS ALONG THE EASTERN WALL IN THAT DRIVE AISLE, BECAUSE THERE'S REALLY NOBODY GOING EAST PAST THAT LAST SPACE. I AM SURE I COULD GET ANOTHER THREE TO FIVE SPACES IN THERE, SO I AM SURE WE COULD ADD FOUR SPACES OUT FRONT AND AT LEAST FIVE INSIDE.
02:04:16.298: >> WHAT REALLY NEEDS TO HAPPEN IS THAT THEY NEED TO BE ACCESSIBLE BICYCLE PARKING SO THAT IT'S NOT A CHALLENGE TO GET YOUR BIKE OUT, THAT IT'S EASY TO GRAB IT AT ANY POINT IN THE DAY, THAT IT'S EASY TO -- YOU KNOW, THIS ISN'T LIKE A CHALLENGE OF TRYING TO ACCESS, SO MAYBE YOU COULD KIND OF DISCUSS MORE ABOUT WHAT KIND OF THAT LAYOUT LOOKS LIKE.
02:04:38.186: >> SO, IN THE AREA THAT'S CURRENTLY DESIGNATED FOR THE ELEVATOR EQUIPMENT, WE COULD MAKE THAT AN ALCOVE. IT'S JUST SOUTH OF THE ELEVATOR THERE, WHERE WE WOULDN'T ACTUALLY NEED TO HAVE A WALL SEGREGATING IT. IT WOULD JUST BE AN ALCOVE IN THE GARAGE, BECAUSE THE GARAGE WOULD BE AN ALCOVE TO THE TENANTS. IT WOULD BE A CLASS B TYPE PARKING LOT. IT IS AN ENCLOSED GARAGE BUT DOESN'T HAVE A SEPARATE ROOM AROUND IT, AND THE OTHER TYPE B SPOTS THAT I COULD GET ARE ALONG THE EASTERN WALL.
02:05:25.467: >> THAT SEEMS A LITTLE MORE PREFERABLE. I MEAN, IT'S CHALLENGING TO MANEUVER PAST A VEHICLE TO GET INTO -- THROUGH A DOOR TO --
02:05:36.044: >> YOU MEAN IN HERE? THAT'S WHY I WAS SAYING, WE WOULD JUST GET RID OF THIS WALL AND CREATE AN ALCOVE.
02:05:48.524: >> I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR WHAT OTHERS THINK ON THAT, AND THEN THIS ISN'T SO MUCH A COMMENT FOR -- A RECOMMENDATION FOR YOU TO APPROVE. I DO AGREE WITH THE COMMENTS ABOUT THIS BEING NOT A -- THE BRIDGE IS JUST VERY DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE, AND THERE'S A LOT OF -- BOTH FOR BICYCLISTS AND PEDE PEDESTRIANS, AND WE KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF ACTIVITY THERE RIGHT NOW. WE KNOW IT'S A POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS SPOT IN OUR CITY AND IT GETS A LOT OF ACTIVITY. WHAT'S THE TIMELINE FOR THIS BUILDING BEING BUILT?
02:06:22.524: >> WE WOULD LIKE TO GET THERE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION TO START THIS SUMMER, AFTER THE SUMMER RAINS, LATE JULY, AUGUST, WHEN THE RAINS TAPER OFF, AND GET THAT ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION DONE SO WE CAN CONTINUE TO DO THE FOUNDATIONAL WORK IN THE FALL, AND THEN WE'D LIKE TO GET ALL OF THE EARTH WORK DONE BY NEXT WINTER.
02:06:47.883: >> BY SPRING, PROBABLY?
02:06:53.956: >> PROBABLY FALL OCCUPANCY OF NEXT YEAR.
02:06:56.091: >> OKAY. I'M JUST WONDERING ABOUT US INCLUDING WITHIN THE NEXT C.I.P. A REQUEST FOR UPGRADES ON PEDESTRIAN IMPROVEMENTS AT THIS LOCATION. WE KNOW THAT WE ARE ADDING MORE POPULATION HERE. WE KNOW THAT IT'S A PROBLEMATIC AREA. I THINK IT WOULD BE NICE FOR STAFF TO BE WORKING WITH TRANSPORTATION STAFF TO SEE, YOU KNOW, SORT OF WHAT SORT OF PEDESTRIAN CROSSING IMPROVEMENTS COULD HAPPEN AT THIS LOCATION. CERTAINLY THE ADVOCACY COMMUNITY COULD MENTION SOMETHING TOO, BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE MORE HELPFUL TO HAVE THIS BE SOMETHING THAT WE RECOGNIZE AS A PROBLEM AREA AND WE ARE MOVING MORE PEOPLE IN, AND IT SEEMS LIKE THE TIMELINE MIGHT FIT THE RELATIVELY MODEST IMPROVEMENTS TO THIS AREA THAT WOULD GO A LONG WAY TO HELPING CONNECTIVITY, I THINK.
02:07:49.678: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN: COMMISSIONER TRUDEAU?
02:07:50.879: >> COMMISSIONER TRUDEAU:  THANK YOU. I'LL ECHO ALL OF THE NICE THINGS PEOPLE HAVE SAID SO FAR ABOUT THE DESIGN OF THIS PROJECT. I THINK IT IS A NICE SCALE. IT'S NICELY DESIGNED. IT'LL FIT WELL IN THE CONTEXT. I LIKE PARTICULARLY HOW IT ECHOES WITH THE FLAT IRON BUILDING, WHICH I THINK WAS PARTICULARLY WELL RECEIVED BY THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND THE CITY. I WILL ALSO JUST SAY I APPRECIATE ALL OF THE PUSHBACK ON GETTING BETTER BIKE PARKING HERE. I LIVE VERY CLOSE TO HERE AND WALK THROUGH HERE AND BIKE AROUND HERE A LOT, AND IT'S A VERY BIKEABLE AREA, AND CONVENIENT ACCESSIBLE BIKE PARKING WOULD BE GREAT HERE. I WOULD BE HAPPY TO SEE ONE OR TWO PARKING SPACES GO AWAY FOR THAT, BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE GOT SOME IDEAS, AND I WOULD HOPE YOU PUSH THOSE FORWARD. SO, TO SHIFT GEARS, MAYBE I CAN ASK MS. THATCHER TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SORT OF THE INTENT OF C1A ZONING, AS SORT OF IT WAS ORIGINALLY CONCEIVED, AND HOW WE THINK ABOUT IT FITTING IT IN THIS PARTICULAR CONTEXT.
02:09:01.082: >> YES. SO, C1A IS A CAMPUS BUSINESS DISTRICT. IN THE STAFF COMMENTS, THERE'S A LITTLE HISTORY OF HOW THE C DISTRICTS HAVE EVOLVED OVER TIME. THERE WAS NO RESIDENTIAL ALLOWED, AND THEN IT WAS ALLOWED IN SOME DISTRICTS, AND NOW IT'S ALLOWED IN ALL C DISTRICTS. IT IS INTENDED PRIMARILY TO SERVE AS A NEIGHBORHOOD SHOPPING AREA FOR THE UNIVERSITY-ORIENTED POPULATION THAT IS CONCENTRATED AROUND IT. YOU COULD ARGUE EITHER WAY ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS CLOSE TO THE UNIVERSITY. YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T HIT THE HOSPITAL WITH A STONE IF YOU THROW IT, BUT IT'S CERTAINLY WALKING DISTANCE IF YOU'RE A RESIDENT WORKING THERE, BUT IT'S NOT SOUTH U EITHER, SO THAT IS PROBABLY OPEN TO INTERPRETATION. IT'S IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT ITS RELATIONSHIP ALSO TO THE C1B DISTRICT, WHICH IS WHAT'S THERE NOW, THE MAIN DIFFERENCE BEING THE HEIGHT LIMIT AND THE SETBACKS. THIS BLOCK IN PARTICULAR IS A TOUGH ONE, BECAUSE THERE ARE ONE, TWO, THREE -- AT LEAST FIVE PARCELS, AND THEY ARE ALL GOING TO HAVE SETBACKS, AND SO NOTHING COHESIVE IS GOING TO GO ON UNDER THE CURRENT ZONING DISTRICT, SO I DO THINK THAT REZONING WITH CONDITIONS IS APPROPRIATE HERE. THE KEY IS THE CONDITIONS. WITHOUT THE CONDITIONS, I DON'T THINK THAT IT WOULD WORK WELL IN THIS LOCATION AT ALL.
02:10:36.644: >> THANK YOU FOR THAT SUMMARY, AND I'LL ALSO SAY THAT THE MASTER PLAN DOES INDICATE COMMERCIAL AND OFFICE USE HERE, AND NOT RESIDENTIAL USE, AND YOU KIND OF TALKED ABOUT THE HISTORY OF COMMERCIAL ZONING AND WHAT THAT MEANS. SO I WANTED TO GET SOME CONTEXT HERE. THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT A C1A ZONING WITH CONDITIONS AT THIS TABLE, AND THIS MAY NOT BE THE FIRST TIME -- THIS MIGHT BE THE LAST TIME WE SEE THIS KIND OF PROPOSAL. I'M VERY COMFORTABLE WITH THAT SORT OF LIKE JUDGMENT CALL TO SAY THIS IS APPROPRIATE HERE. I THINK WE ARE SORT OF USING OUR ZONING CODE TO SIT SOMETHING APPROPRIATE ON THE SITE, AND I THINK OVERALL IT FITS WITH THE INTENT OF THE MASTER PLAN, AND IT FITS WITH THE CHARACTER OF THE AREA. I THINK IT'S A GREAT PROJECT. I JUST -- I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE AIRED THAT CONVERSATION, BECAUSE, AGAIN, I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO BE ONE THAT'S GOING TO BE GOING AWAY, ESPECIALLY WITH THESE CAMPUS-ORIENTED ZONINGS, WHICH THIS ISN'T ADJACENT TO CAMPUS. IT'S KIND OF CLOSE NEARBY, BUT IT'S NOT REALLY THAT, AND SO THINKING DOWN THE LINE, ESPECIALLY ONCE WE GET THROUGH THE MASTER PLAN LAND USE UPDATE PROCESS, WHICH HOPEFULLY WILL BE FUNDED AND HAPPEN IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS, HOPEFULLY THERE WILL BE SOME CLUES AS TO WHAT WE DO WITH THESE ZONING CATEGORIES DOWN THE LINE AND STREAMLINE IT AND MAKE IT AN EASIER THING TO DO, BECAUSE THIS IS A GREAT PROJECT, AND I WOULD LOVE TO SEE IT MORE OF THIS SCALE AND THIS QUALITY IN OTHER PARTS OF THE CITY, BUT SO, YEAH. THANKS FOR ENTERTAINING THAT.
02:12:16.711: >> COULD I JUST ADD ONE OTHER THING? THE OTHER DIFFICULTY OF ALL OF THE OTHER C ZONING DISTRICTS, ONCE YOU GET INTO NONRESIDENTIAL USE, SO MUCH PARKING IS REQUIRED THAT IT IS REALLY, REALLY PROHIBITED TO SMALL SITES AND EVEN MEDIUM SITES IN SOME CASES, WHICH IS WHY I THINK YOU DON'T GET REDEVELOPMENT WITH RETAIL ON SOMETHING AS SMALL AS THIS OR EVEN SOMETHING FOUR TIMES AS BIG AS THIS.
02:12:44.004: >> WE'LL CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION AROUND THAT IN GENERAL TO SUPPORT ADAPTATION FOR SORT OF INCREMENTAL PROJECTS THAT ARE HARD TO DO IN THE CITY RIGHT NOW, SORT OF BECAUSE OF OUR PARKING REQUIREMENT AND IS OTHER RESTRICTIONS IN OUR ZONING, INCLUDING THINGS LIKE SETBACKS. I THINK THIS IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF WHAT WE COULD GET IF WE THINK CAREFULLY ABOUT WHAT THOSE RULES ARE AND HOW WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO LOOSEN THEM UP TO ALLOW FOR SOME OF THIS KIND OF INCREMENTAL IN-FILL.
02:13:15.470: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  MR. MOORE, I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FOR YOU. CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE HVAC UNITS IN THE BUILDING ITSELF?
02:13:22.677: >> THE INTENT IS TO USE THE V.R.F. SYSTEM. IT'S A HEAT PUMP SYSTEM. IT ALLOWS FOR THE MOVEMENT OF HEAT WITHIN THE BUILDING. SO YOU HAVE GOT A BUILDING WHICH IS AN EAST-WEST ACCESS BUILDING, SO YOU HAVE GOT A LARGE NORTH FACE AND A LARGE SOUTH FACE, AND IN THE SUNNY DAYS LIKE TODAY, YOU GET HEAT BUILD-UP ON ONE SIDE BUT IT'S STILL CHILLY ON THE OTHER. YOU HAVE TO GENERATE ELECTRICITY ON ONE SIDE TO HEAT IT ON THE OTHER, SO THAT'S THE SYSTEM WE ARE PLANNING ON FOR THE BUILDING, IS THAT VRF SYSTEM, SO WE CAN MOVE THAT HEAT WITHIN THE BUILDING, COMMONLY CALLED A HEAT PUMP SYSTEM.
02:14:08.222: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  AND THEN ALSO TALK ABOUT THE EXTERIOR. YOU KNOW I WAS GOING TO TALK ABOUT THIS.
02:14:16.096: >> NO...
02:14:16.664: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  SO, FIRST, BEFORE WE GET TO COLOR, LET'S TALK ABOUT THE BRICK TYPE. ARE WE TALKING ABOUT BRICK PANELS? ARE WE TALKING ABOUT FULL BRICK? WHAT'S THE PLAN FOR THE EXTERIOR.
02:14:26.741: >> SO THE ANSWER IS BOTH. IN THE MARK, ACROSS FROM ARGUS FARM STOP, THAT IS A SINGLE BRICK, BUT BOTH IN FULL DEPTH AND IN THIN DEPTH, DEPENDING ON THE STRUCTURAL LOCATION IN THE BUILDING, SO WHERE THE BUILDING OFFSETS AND STEPS BACK, YOU'RE DOING A LOT OF HEAVY WEIGHT IN THOSE OFFSETS, SO IN THOSE KINDS OF SITUATIONS, WE USED THE THINNER VENEER, ONE-INCH THICK BRICK AS OPPOSED TO FOUR-INCH THICK BRICK. WHERE IT'S GROUND SUPPORTED AND WHERE WE HAVE THE STRUCTURAL ABILITY TO DO IT, WE USE THE FULL BRICK. WHERE IT'S NOT STRUCTURALLY APPROPRIATE, WE USE THE THINNER BRICK.
02:15:08.682: >> PART OF THE REASON WHY I ASK THAT QUESTION IS BECAUSE YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE QUITE A BIT OF ROAD NOISE FROM THE BROADWAY BRIDGES, THE DIVISIONS, AND THE RAIL LINE RIGHT THERE. SO I THINK FULL BRICK OFFERS A LITTLE BIT MORE INSULATION THAT MIGHT HELP WITH THE NOISE. SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU, IF AT ALL POSSIBLE, TO LOOK INTO THAT, TO SEE IF FULL BRICK COULD BE USED THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE BUILDING.
02:15:31.705: >> WE ACTUALLY LOOKED INTO THAT IN THE MARK, BECAUSE THE RAIL IS MUCH CLOSER IN THE MARK, SO WE DID STUDIES OF HOW TO BUILD THAT ASSEMBLY TO MITIGATE THAT NOISE, EVEN THOUGH ON THAT SIDE OF THE BUILDING IS WHERE WE USED THE THIN BRICK.
02:15:51.158: >> LET'S TALK ABOUT THE COLOR. WE HAVE SEEN MANY PROJECTS TURNING OUT BROWN, AND I JUST WANTED TO GET YOUR IDEA AS TO WHY THIS IS THE COLOR PALETTE THAT'S BEING CHOSEN FOR THESE BUILDINGS AND WHY NOT MIX IT UP A LITTLE BIT AND DO SOME OTHER COLORS.
02:16:05.839: >> YOU'LL BE HAPPY TO NOTE IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS, AS THE MONTGOMERY BUILDING FACADE IS BEING PUT UP, THAT THAT'S NOT BROWN.
02:16:14.281: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  THANK YOU.
02:16:15.382: >> THAT WILL BE A CREAM COLORED BRICK, SO PART OF IT IS CLIENT PREFERENCE, CERTAINLY, BUT THE OTHER FACTOR IS LOOKING AT THE BRICKS THAT YOU CAN GET WHICH ARE MANUFACTURED IN BOTH THE FOUR-INCH AND THE THIN VENEER, BUT IT JUST HAPPENS TO BE THAT THE BRICK MANUFACTURERS, IF THAT'S YOUR PARAMETER IN SELECTING BRICK, IT LIMITS YOUR SELECTION, SO IT'S FAR MORE OF THE BROWNS AND REDS AVAILABLE IN THAT NARROW AND THICK THAN IT IS FOR THE OTHER COLORS IN THE SPECTRUM FOR BRICK.
02:16:48.948: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  MAYBE A LIGHTER BROWN, OR A TAUPE-Y, TAN OF SOMETHING OF THAT SORT, JUST SOMETHING TO CONSIDER.
02:16:56.956: >> THANK YOU.
02:16:57.324: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  AND THEN IN REGARDS TO THE ALLEY, SO I'M PRETTY SURE I HAVE BEEN UP AND DOWN THAT ALLEY A COUPLE OF TIMES WHEN I NEEDED TO AVOID SOME TRAFFIC. AND I'M PRETTY SURE I HAVE BEEN IN BOTH DIRECTIONS ON THAT ALLEY. CAN YOU CONFIRM THAT IT'S TRULY A ONE-WAY ALLEY AND THAT I POSTED?
02:17:17.708: >> YES. HE HAS A CIVIL ENGINEERING DEGREE. THAT'S WHY I DEFER TO HIM. I AM NOT SURE EVERYBODY ALWAYS ABIDES BY SIGNAGE.
02:17:30.087: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  AND THEN JUST A FOLLOW-UP QUESTION FOR THE ENGINEER, CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE WATER ALONG WITH THE GREEN ROOF AND HOW WATER IS GOING TO BE MANAGED ON THE SITE?
02:17:38.896: >> SURE.  SO THE MAJORITY OF THE ROOF WILL BE A GREEN ROOF SYSTEM, AND WE ARE ONLY REQUIRED TO PROVIDE THE FIRST FLASH, SO WE HAVE PROVIDED THAT STORAGE ON THE ROOF. THERE WILL BE ROOF DRAINS THAT COME DOWN, AND THEN THERE WILL BE A DRAIN THAT GOES OUT TO THE PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY, BUT THERE WILL BE A CONTROL STRUCTURE IN THERE WITH A BAFFLE ON IT THAT CONTROLS THE RELEASE RATE FROM THE ROOF TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE NOT GOING OVER THE ALLOWABLE RELEASE RATES.
02:18:06.223: >> OKAY. THANK YOU. FURTHER DISCUSSION?
02:18:11.395: >> I JUST WANTED TO POINT OUT THE REASON THAT WE HAVE THAT EXTRA FIVE FEET THAT JILL MENTIONED IN OUR OVERALL HEIGHT IS BECAUSE THE ROOF IS GOING TO BE SOLAR READY, AND WE KNOW UNDER THE NEW UDC, THE NEW MEASURE TO THE TOP OF THE SOLAR PANEL, SO WE WANTED TO PRESERVE OUR ABILITY TO PUT THE SOLAR PANELS UP THERE AND NOT RUN OVER THE HEIGHT LIMIT.
02:18:33.584: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN: COMMISSIONER MILLS?
02:18:35.786: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  GOING BACK TO THE BICYCLE PARKING, AND I'M NOT TOTALLY SOLD -- I SORT OF WANT TO SEE WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE, IN PART, AND THE OTHER QUESTION THAT I HAVE FOR THE PETITIONER IS THAT THE STAFF REPORT SAYS THAT THERE'S 11 PARKING -- OR VEHICLE PARKING SPACES. ONE PLACE SAYS 11, ANOTHER PLACE SAYS 14. AND THEN THREE ARE MARKED AS VEHICLE STORAGE, WHICH I THINK YOU KIND OF KNOW HOW THIS BODY FEELS ABOUT VEHICLE STORAGE, WHICH IS THAT THAT, IN MY MIND, IS A GREAT PLACE TO TAKE UP VEHICLE STORAGE AND PUT IN BICYCLES, SO WHY IS THE VEHICLE STORAGE, AND WHAT ARE WE ACTUALLY SEEING?
02:19:21.098: >> [ OFF MIC ] -- SO IT IS PERFECTLY REASONABLE TO BELIEVE THAT IF THE COUNT ASSOCIATION DECIDES THAT THEY WOULD PREFER THAT SPACE TO PARK THEIR OWN BIKES, THAT'S HOW THEY WILL USE THAT SPACE. BUT IF THEY WANT TO KEEP IT FOR A GUEST TO PARK THERE, IT WILL BE UP THERE TO THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE TO DECIDE THE USE OF THAT SPACE.
02:19:47.758: >> WHY DOES IT SAY STORAGE INSTEAD OF GUEST?
02:19:50.193: >> I CAN CHANGE THE LABEL.
02:19:52.229: >> IT DOESN'T MEET CODE FOR TURNING WIDTHS AND AISLE SPACES. THOSE THREE ARE MARKED DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT LEGAL PARKING SPACES. YOU COULD CERTAINLY GET A CAR INTO THEM.
02:20:02.973: >> THEY WOULDN'T MEET THE DEFINITION OF A SURFACE LOT OUTSIDE IN A PARKING LOT, BUT THEY ARE CERTAINLY USABLE AS AN INTERIOR SPACE.
02:20:13.484: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  I THINK THAT THAT'S CONFUSING AND NOT SUPER HELPFUL, AND I THINK, PERSONALLY, THAT I WANT TO SEE HOW BIKE PARKING IS GOING TO FIT HERE, AND SO I WOULD LIKE TO POSTPONE THIS TO SEE HOW THAT'S GOING TO WORK ON THIS SITE. THE OTHER THING THAT I'M CURIOUS ABOUT FROM THE BODY BUT I THINK I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE AN AMENDMENT TO THE MOTION, THAT WE, AGAIN, THIS IS WITH -- OR MAYBE WE CAN'T DO THIS, BUT MAYBE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE OFFERED BECAUSE IT'S A CONDITIONAL REZONING, OR WITH THESE CONDITIONS, BUT I THINK THAT SOMETHING THAT LOCKS IN THE IDEA THAT THERE'S BICYCLE PARKING HERE -- CLASS B IS GREAT. I THINK THAT DOING CLASS B RATHER THAN CLASS A IS FINE, BUT FOR THIS PARTICULAR LOCATION, AND FOR THIS PARTICULAR USE, I THINK THAT MAKING SURE THAT WHATEVER GETS BUILT HERE HAS ADEQUATE FACILITIES TO BE ABLE TO MAKE USE OF THIS FANTASTIC LOCATION ACCESSIBLE TO ALL OF THE NONMOTORIZED TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS HERE I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT. BUT I DEFER TO STAFF ON HOW THAT WORKS. AND IS IT APPROPRIATE FOR US TO PUT SOMETHING LIKE THAT AS PART OF THE MOTION?
02:21:39.670: >> I JUST WANTED --
02:21:40.203: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  YOU CAN ASK THEM. THEY WOULD HAVE TO VOLUNTARILY AGREE TO IT.
02:21:46.109: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  UH-HUH.
02:21:46.710: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  THERE IS NO RESTRICTION ON YOU ASKING FOR THE BUILDING TO BE PURPLE OR MORE PARKING OR WHATEVER YOU WOULD LIKE. ULTIMATELY, THOUGH, THEY HAVE TO VOLUNTARILY OFFER THAT, AND AT THE END OF THAT DAY, IT IS ULTIMATELY UP TO YOU AND THE CITY COUNCIL TO ULTIMATELY MAKE A DECISION ON WHAT THEY ARE OFFERING.
02:22:05.729: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  GOT IT.
02:22:07.764: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  DOES THAT HELP AT ALL?
02:22:09.032: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  THAT IS, AND I WILL BE MAKING A MOTION TO POSTPONE THIS. BECAUSE WE ARE BEING ASKED TO REZONE, WHICH IS, YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK THAT THE -- WHICH IS SOMETHING WHERE WE HAVE LOTS OF DISCRETION AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT IT MATCHES THE MASTER PLAN, I'M NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THE PLAN THAT WE ARE SEEING IS READY FOR REZONING, ACCORDING TO THIS.
02:22:31.854: >> SO I WOULD JUST MENTION THAT I HAD A CHANCE TO TALK WITH MEMBERS OF THE DEVELOPMENT TEAM, AND THEY ARE HAPPY TO COMPLY WITH COMMISSIONER BRIGGS' IDEA OF ELIMINATING THE SOUTHEASTERN MOST VEHICLE STORAGE SPOT AND DEDICATING THAT TO BICYCLES, AS WELL AS THE AISLE THAT'S RIGHT NEXT TO IT, SO IF THAT HELPS, THEY ARE WILLING TO DO THAT.
02:22:56.946: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS: SOUTHEASTERN MOST, SO --
02:22:59.216: >> AS WELL AS THE STRIPED AREA NEXT TO IT.
02:23:03.386: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  THE STRIPED AREA NEXT TO IT. WHAT'S THE STRIPED AREA -- THAT'S JUST FOR A WALKING PATH, THAT WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO GET INTO THAT VEHICLE, OR WHAT IS THAT?
02:23:12.095: >> YEAH, THAT'S ALL THAT WAS FOR.
02:23:15.999: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  GOT IT. GREAT. I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY SPACES YOU CAN FIT ON HERE NOW. I THINK THERE WAS ALSO SOME CONCERN THAT COMMISSIONER SAUVE, MAYBE, OR MAYBE IT WAS COMMISSIONER WEATHERBEE NOTED ABOUT GETTING INTO THE CLASS A SPACES. I THINK RETHINKING HOW THAT WORKS MIGHT BE HELPFUL. OTHERS MIGHT HAVE COMMENTS.
02:23:40.890: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN: COMMISSIONER SAUVE?
02:23:44.794: >> COMMISSIONER SAUVE:  SO I'M JUST LOOKING AT VEHICLE STORAGE NEXT TO COMPACT CAR SIX AND THAT ENTIRE SOUTH WALL AND EAST WALL, THAT WHOLE CORNER BEING A PRETTY VIABLE SPOT FOR BOTH PARKED AND VERTICAL, AND IF THERE'S A WAY TO OFFER UP THAT WHOLE ZONE, I FEEL LIKE THAT'S A COMFORTABLE AREA FOR MANEUVERING AND ENOUGH STORAGE TO -- I GUESS MY -- IF BICYCLE PARKING IS A THING TO POSTPONE -- I THINK IF THEY ARE OPEN TO ALLOCATING ENOUGH FOOTPRINT THAT WE BELIEVE THAT WE CAN FIT MAYBE EIGHT REQUIRED IN THE, YOU KNOW, GARAGE, AND TWO HOOPS ARE REQUIRED WITHIN 15 FEET OF THE FRONT DOOR, IF THOSE TWO CONDITIONS CAN BE ADDED --
02:24:33.210: >> WE'LL DO THAT.
02:24:36.279: >> COMMISSIONER SAUVE:  THAT WOULD BE KIND OF MY PROPOSAL. TEN AND FOUR? DO YOU WANT ME TO MAKE A MOTION?
02:24:42.252: >> MS. THATCHER HAS A --
02:24:44.187: >> JUST TO CLARIFY, A NINE BY 16-FOOT PARKING SPACE IS THE PERFECT SIZE FOR EIGHT CLASS B --
02:24:54.030: >> SO IF WE ARE TRADING ONE, I WOULD JUST KIND OF PUT THEM ALL IN ONE SPACE WHERE SOME ARE ALREADY SET AND MAKE IT AN EFFICIENT USE SO WE ARE NOT PUTTING BIKES IN TWO OR THREE DIFFERENT AREAS. SO WOULD YOU VOLUNTARILY OFFER THOSE TWO CONDITIONS UP?
02:25:12.179: >> WE VOLUNTARILY OFFER TO DO THAT.
02:25:14.348: >> COMMISSIONER SAUVE:  OKAY. SO...  DO I NEED A MOTION THEN FOR THAT? HOW DO WE WRITE THIS IN?
02:25:23.924: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  YES, WE SHOULD PROBABLY PUT THAT UNDER FOUR IN THE FIRST MOTION. WHY DON'T YOU MAYBE WORK ON QUICK LANGUAGE FOR IT WHILE WE GO TO COMMISSIONER WOODS? IS THAT OKAY? OR COMMISSIONER MILLS WILL DRAFT A QUICK LITTLE BULLET POINT WHILE WE GO TO COMMISSIONER WOODS?
02:25:40.707: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS:  WELL, I WOULD CERTAINLY BE IN FAVOR OF THAT, BECAUSE I DON'T -- I THINK GIVEN THE PROJECT AND GIVEN THE BENEFITS THAT ARE GOING TO HAPPEN FROM THIS, I WOULD HATE TO SEE IT POSTPONED FOR THAT REASON, SO I'M GLAD TO SEE THAT IT LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING REASONABLE IS BEING WORKED OUT IN TERMS OF THE BICYCLES, AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT -- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE SOME TROOPS ON THE STREET, BUT QUITE FRANKLY, A LOT OF TIMES IF YOUR BIKE IS OUT, IT'S GOING TO GET STOLEN OR VANDALIZED, SO I THINK EVEN IF YOU LIVE UP ON THE THIRD OR FOURTH FLOOR, IT'S PROBABLY BETTER TO HAVE YOUR BIKE IN THE BASEMENT WHERE IT WILL STILL BE THERE WHEN YOU COME DOWN, RATHER THAN BY THE FRONT DOOR, BECAUSE THIS IS GOING TO BE A HIGH TRAFFIC AREA AS WELL. SO I'M GLAD TO SEE THAT REMOVING THE VEHICLE STORAGE AREA WILL WORK FOR MORE BICYCLES.
02:26:51.645: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN: COMMISSIONER TRUDEAU.
02:26:53.680: >> COMMISSIONER TRUDEAU:  I'M GLAD WE ARE MOVING THIS FORWARD. I WAS HESITANT TO POSTPONE ON THIS ISSUE. I TOTALLY FORGOT WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY. I HAD ANOTHER POINT TO FOLLOW UP ON IT, BUT I FORGOT WHAT THAT WAS, SO I'LL SIT BACK AND THINK ON IT AGAIN.
02:27:13.032: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  ARE WE READY? COMMISSIONER MILLS?
02:27:15.436: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  BEC  SE I AM DRAFTING THIS, I GET TO PICK THE NUMBERS. [ LAUGHTER ] I -- SO WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THE ADDITIONAL BULLET THAT I WOULD HAVE HERE, THAT, AGAIN, THIS IS THE CONDITION THAT I WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU'RE WELCOME TO -- THE EDITION OF AT LEAST TEN CLASS B BICYCLE SPACES AND FOUR CLASS C BICYCLE SPACES, IN ADDITION TO THE TWO CLASS A BICYCLE SPACES.
02:27:43.463: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  DO WE HAVE A SECOND? SECOND BY COMMISSIONER SAUVE. DISCUSSION ON THE AMENDMENT? COMMISSIONER BRIGGS.
02:27:53.673: >> COMISSIONER BRIGGS:  MY ONLY POINT, AND I THINK YOU MENTIONED THIS, THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SAY THOSE CLASS C ONES IN FRONT OF THE BUILDING, BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE A GUEST WOULD WANT TO USE THEM.
02:28:03.750: >> YEAH, THAT WAS MY QUESTION ABOUT LOCATION, BEING --
02:28:08.688: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  AND I DEBATED THAT. I'M THINKING -- SO, DOES THIS CONDITION GO WITH THE FIRST MOTION AS PART OF THE REZONING, OR DOES IT GO WITH THE SECOND ONE ABOUT THE SITE PLAN? BECAUSE THIS IS THE OTHER THING THAT'S TRICKY, RIGHT? WE KNOW THAT ONCE IT'S REZONED, IT MAY OR MAY NOT -- IT'S REZONED, RIGHT? AND SO IT MAY OR MAY NOT BE THIS BUILDING THAT'S BUILT, AND SO I -- I WOULD SUGGEST -- I TOTALLY -- I DON'T WANT TO DELAY THIS FOR THIS EITHER, BUT I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WHAT WE DISCUSSED HERE, WHICH IS NOT HAVING -- IT'S A CLASS B SPOT TO HAVE IT HUNG OVER A CAR. LET'S BE HONEST, BUT WE DON'T WANT THAT. WE WANT EASY IN, LIKE A BICYCLE AREA, RIGHT, AND SO I THINK THAT THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR THIS SITE PLAN, BUT I WOULD ALSO SUGGEST TO US THAT WE, FOR -- IF FOR SOME REASON THIS DOES NOT GET BUILT, THE REZONING ALSO HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL BICYCLES. SO WHAT'S THE RIGHT WAY TO DO THAT, BRETT?
02:29:11.517: >> SO I THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER IN THE FIRST MOTION, BECAUSE I THINK THAT THAT STAYS WITH THE PROPERTY, VERSUS THE SITE PLAN COULD CHANGE AT ANY POINT, SO I THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER AS NUMBER FOUR, THE FOURTH BULLET IN THE FIRST MOTION, WITH REGARDS TO THE REZONING.
02:29:29.736: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  AND THE INTENTION OF THIS, WHICH IS THAT WE ARE TRUSTING THAT THAT'S FULFILLED BEFORE IT GOES TO CITY COUNCIL, THAT THAT IS WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT, IS THOSE FOUR CLASS C SPOTS IN FRONT OF THE BUILDING, AND THE TEN CLASS B SPOTS IN THE GARAGE, EASILY ACCESSIBLE, IN THAT GENERAL VICINITY OF WHERE LISA HAD SUGGESTED.
02:30:00.399: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  SHOULD WE ADD SOMETHING TO THE SITE PLAN MOTION AS WELL WITH REGARDS TO BICYCLE PARKING?
02:30:07.907: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  I WOULD DEFER TO -- WHAT DOES STAFF THINK?
02:30:11.544: >> JOE, YELL AT ME IF YOU DISAGREE. I WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU, THE PLANNING COMMISSION, CONSIDER THE ADDITION OF A FOURTH BULLET IN THE CONDITIONAL ZONING, THAT IT WOULD BE THAT TEN CLASS B SPACES AND FOUR CLASS C SPACES OUTSIDE AT THE FRONT OF THE BUILDING, AND I WOULD ALSO SUGGEST THAT YOUR SITE PLAN MOTION CONSIDER A CONDITION THAT THE SITE PLAN BE AMENDED TO REFLECT ALTERATIONS TO THE NORTHEAST PORTION OF THE GARAGE AREA TO REFLECT A LARGER BIKE STORAGE AREA TO ACCOMMODATE THE UP TO --
02:30:58.158: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  TO ACCOMMODATE THE CLASS B PARKING.
02:31:00.727: >> YEAH, THE CLASS B SPACES. AND TO BE CLEAR, I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT -- I THINK IT'S YES, BUT I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT THAT WOULD BE THE PLANNING COMMISSION HEARING, THAT THIS IS VOLUNTARY FROM THE PETITIONER, THAT THEY ARE COMFORTABLE WITH THIS, AND THEN THAT CONDITION WOULD SPARK US TO REQUIRE A REVISED PLAN BE SUBMITTED TO US THAT REFLECTS THAT CHANGE BEFORE IT PROGRESSES TO CITY COUNCIL.
02:31:24.617: >> SINCE WE ARE OFFERING, I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE IT BE CLEAR THAT THE TEN SPACES THAT'S BEING DISCUSSED COULD ALSO BE CLASS A. THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE CLASS B, SO THEY COULD BE CLASS B OR CLASS A, AND THAT WE WOULD HAVE THE FREEDOM OF PUTTING THEM EITHER IN THE NORTHEAST OR SOUTHEAST CORNER. I WANT TO WORK ON THE GEOMETRY TO GET THE MOST THAT I CAN, AND I WANT THE FLEXIBILITY ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE BUILDING, EITHER NORTH OR SOUTHEAST.
02:31:55.615: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  CLASS A, GENERALLY -- A IS BEST FOR BICYCLE PARKING, IN TERMS OF THE MOST SECURITY, SO I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT. I THINK TUCKING TWO OR THREE HERE AND TWO OR THREE THERE IS NOT OUR INTENTION, RIGHT, AS LONG AS THAT IS REFLECTED, I'M OKAY WITH THAT.
02:32:16.369: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  I FEEL THAT WE CAN VERIFY THAT BEFORE IT PROGRESSES.
02:32:22.742: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  SO THE AMENDMENT IS TO ADD BULLET FOUR THAT LISTS TEN CLASS B OR BETTER, FOUR CLASS C, AND THEN TWO CLASS A. ALL RIGHT. IT'S BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED. ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION ON THE AMENDMENT? ALL THOSE IN FAVOR PLEASE SAY AYE? [ CHORUS OF AYES ] OPPOSED? ALL RIGHT. SO THAT AMENDMENT HAS BEEN APPROVED. WE ARE BACK TO THE MAIN TWO MOTIONS. COMMISSIONER MILLS?
02:32:58.878: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  JUST DID WE NEED TO MAKE THAT SECOND MOTION TO AMEND THE SITE PLAN MOTION, WHICH IS -- BRETT READ IT. AND THIS ONE, JUST TO BE CLEAR, IS NOT THE CONDITIONS PART. THIS IS WHAT WE -- YEAH.
02:33:16.529: >> I WOULD CONSIDER THAT THE PLANNING COMMISSION HEREBY RECOMMENDS THAT THE MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL APPROVE THE GARNET SITE BY AN DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT CONDITIONED UPON AMENDMENT TO THE PLAN TO REFLECT THE ADDITION OF BIKE PARKING AND THE GARAGE LEVEL CONSOLIDATED CLASS B OR BETTER BY PARKING IN THE GARAGE LEVEL, AND THEN THAT'S LEAVING SOME DISCRETION ON US TO MAKE THE INTERPRETATION OF WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAVE SATISFIED THAT BEFORE WE SEND IT ON TO CITY COUNCIL.
02:33:53.966: >> DOES THAT ALSO -- WILL YOU BE LOOKING AT THAT CLASS C PARKING IS BY THE FRONT DOOR?
02:33:59.472: >> AND CLASS C -- YEP. AND COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN CAN KEEP US HONEST.
02:34:12.351: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  MOVED BY COMMISSIONER MILLS, SECOND BY COMMISSIONER BRIGGS. ANY DISCUSSION ON THAT AMENDMENT? COMMISSIONER TRUDEAU?
02:34:18.124: >> COMMISSIONER TRUDEAU:  I REMEMBERED MY POINT, AND I WILL MAKE IT NOW. SORRY. SO, THE REASON I'M SORT OF -- I'LL SUPPORT THIS. THE REASON I'M HESITANT TO KIND OF GET INTO THIS LEVEL OF DETAIL WITH THIS IS BECAUSE THIS IS A SMALL CONDO-OWNER OCCUPIED BUILDING WITH -- AND THIS IS COMMON SPACE THAT THE RESIDENTS COULD CHOOSE TO MANAGE FOR THEMSELVES HOW THEY SEE FIT, AND I THINK LIKE MICROMANAGING THIS FOR THEM, VERSUS A LARGER BUILDING WITH LOTS OF RESIDENTS OR A RENTAL BUILDING WHERE THE RENTERS HAVE A LOT LESS CONTROL OVER HOW THEIR COMMON SPACE IS CONFIGURED OR CONTROLLED, I DON'T KNOW, THERE'S A DEMOCRATIC MECHANISM FOR PEOPLE TO MANAGE THE COMMON SPACE THAT THEY OWN TOGETHER. SO I'LL OBVIOUSLY SUPPORT THIS, BUT I THINK WE DON'T NECESSARILY NEED TO PUSH IT. BUT THAT'S ALL I WANTED TO SAY.
02:35:11.544: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN: COMMISSIONER BRIGGS?
02:35:13.612: >> COMISSIONER BRIGGS:  I JUST WANTED TO SAY THANK YOU FOR VOLUNTEERING, OF SORTS, TO PROVIDE THIS. I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. I THINK SOMETIMES IT JUST FEELS LIKE, OH, GOD, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT BIKE PARKING, BUT THE REALITY IS, YOU KNOW, THIS IS A GREAT BUILDING AND IN A WONDERFUL LOCATION, AND IF IT'S NOT EQUIPPED FOR PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY BRING IN BICYCLES, I MEAN, WE KNOW THAT THEY -- YOU THINK PEOPLE ARE GOING TO WANT TO BRING IN THEIR CARS. THEY ARE ALSO GOING TO -- I MEAN, I'M ASSUMING THAT THESE UNITS ARE FAIRLY EXPENSIVE, AND COMING FROM A BICYCLING FAMILY AND A LOT OF FRIENDS, WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT A $200 BICYCLE THAT SOMEBODY IN A UNIT LIKE THIS IS GOING TO BUY. THEY ARE PROBABLY TALKING ABOUT A THOUSAND DOLLARS, $2,000 BICYCLES, PEOPLE WHO CAN AFFORD TO LIVE IN THESE LOCATIONS ARE PROBABLY INVESTING IN DECENT BICYCLES. RECOGNIZING THAT AND RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF BICYCLING IN THE TOWN THEY LIVE IN, I'M GLAD THAT THAT'S BEING RECOGNIZED UP FRONT, THAT NOBODY HAS GOT TO TORE THEIR -- THAT THIS IS A BUILDING THAT IS ACTUALLY KIND OF BUILT FOR THEM. SO, THANK YOU.
02:36:25.751: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  ALL RIGHT. WE ARE GOING TO VOTE ON THE AMENDMENT TO THE SITE PLAN MOTION. ALL OF THOSE IN FAVOR, PLEASE SAY AYE. [ CHORUS OF AYES ] OPPOSED? ALL RIGHT. SO WE ARE BACK TO THE TWO AMENDED MOTIONS. ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL RIGHT. ALL OF THOSE IN FAVOR PLEASE SAY AYE. [ CHORUS OF AYES ] OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. AND WE ARE GOING TO TAKE A FIVE-MINUTE BREAK.
02:36:46.572: >> THANK YOU.
02:44:36.473: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  WE WILL START BY GOING TO MR. LENART BEFORE WE GET TO OUR NEXT AGENDA ITEM.
02:44:43.882: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  YES, WELCOME BACK COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL. SO THE NEXT COUPLE OF PROJECTS ARE PUBLIC PROJECTS. I WANT TO REMIND THE PLANNING COMMISSION THAT YOU DON'T SEE A LOT OF THESE, BUT I JUST WANT TO GIVE YOU THE FRAMEWORK FOR WHY YOU'RE SEEING THESE. THE CITY ITSELF IS ACTUALLY EXEMPT FROM THE U. D.C. HOWEVER, IN THE RECENT YEAR OF 1989, THE CITY COUNCIL PASSED A RESOLUTION THAT REQUIRED FOR ANY PUBLIC PROJECTS THAT THEY SEEK COMMENT FROM CITY DEPARTMENTS ABOUT HOW THAT PROJECT DOES OR DOESN'T RELATE TO PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS, AND IT SPECIFICALLY ALSO SAYS FOR ANY PROJECTS THAT EXCEED AN ESTIMATED COST OF $250,000 THAT THAT COMES TO PLANNING COMMISSION FOR THAT REVIEW, SO THE NEXT TWO PROJECTS MEET THAT THRESHOLD. WE FROM JUST A MECHANISM OF PROCESSING IT, WE RUN IT THROUGH A SITE PLAN PROCESS, BOTH ADMINISTRATIVELY OR, IN THIS CASE, PLANNING COMMISSION. HOWEVER, THAT SITE PLAN DOESN'T GO ON TO CITY COUNCIL FOR ANY FORMAL ADOPTION. RATHER, YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT HOW THESE PROJECTS DO OR DON'T MEET TYPICAL PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS ACCOMPANY THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR'S ULTIMATE RECOMMENDATION TO CITY COUNCIL ON WHETHER OR NOT TO FUND THESE IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS, SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT UNIQUE IN THAT I IT'S -- IT LOOKS LIKE A SITE PLAN, LARGELY, TO YOU, BUT THEN THE OUTPUT OF THAT SORT OF GOES WITH THE DECISION OF THE CITY TO ACTUALLY UNDERTAKE THE FINANCING AND FUNDING AND ULTIMATE CONTRACT FOR THESE PROJECTS, SO I JUST WANTED TO GIVE THAT BACKGROUND IN CASE, AS IT'S RELEVANT TO THE NEXT TWO AGENDA ITEMS.
02:46:22.981: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  THANK YOU. AND OUR NEXT ITEM IS THE ANNE ASHLEE PARKING STRUCTURE EXPANSION FOR CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL. WE WILL BEGIN WITH THE PETITIONER.
02:46:31.388: >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MY NAME IS SUSAN PALLE AND JOINING ME MY COLLEAGUES AMBER AND JAYDA. WE ALSO HAVE WITH US THE PROJECT ENGINEER AND ARCHITECT. SO WE ARE GOING TO WALK YOU THROUGH A FEW SLIDES SHOWING YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE PROJECT, AND I'LL START IT OFF. LET'S SEE IF I CAN GET THE ARROWS GOING RIGHT. SO, THE GARAGE WAS BUILT IN I THINK '86-'87. IF NOT THE FIRST PROJECT, I THINK IT WAS THE SECOND PROJECT. THE GARAGE WAS APPROXIMATELY 800 SPACES. THERE ARE TWO LEVELS BELOW GRADE AND SEVERAL ABOVE, SIX LEVELS ABOVE. TH D.D.A. HAS A GOAL FOR ITS WORK IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF Y■■RS TO WORK TOWARD A DEVELOPMENT OF A NUMBER OF THE SURFACE LOTS THAT ARE LOCATED WEST OF MAIN STREET, IF YOU THINK OF THE WESTERN PART OF DOWNTOWN. IN CONJUNCTION WITH THIS PROJECT, MANY OF YOU ARE AWARE OF THE D.D.A.'S PROJECT ON FIRST AND ASHLEE, WHERE WE ARE WORKING TOWARDS PEDESTRIAN SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS, BICYCLE IMPROVEMENTS, AND OTHERS. ASHLEY AND FIRST WILL BOTH BE MADE TWO-WAY. THE GOAL AS I MENTIONED OF THIS PROJECT IS PEDESTRIAN AND BICYCLE SAFETY, BUT ALSO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS, SENSE OF PLACE AND SO FORTH. THE ANN ASHLEY GARAGE IS ASSOCIATED WAU PART OF THE GOAL OF GETTINGE LOTS DE TAKE THE PARKING THAT'S HAPPENING ON THOSE     LOTS AND IT IN THE CITY GARAGE. WHILE WE ARE WORKING TO IMPROVE TO THE GARAGE OR ADD GARAGE, IT'S ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS. WE WOULD BE ADDING THREE FLOORS, WHICH ARE APPROXIMATELY 400 PARKING SPACES. WE WOULD BE ADDING A NEW ELEVATOR ON THE SOUTHWEST ■■RNER, WHICH WOULD FACE TOWARD WHAT WE CALL THE BROWN BLOCK OR CERTAINLY MORE COMFORTABLE FOR THE USERS AND MORE ATTRACTIVE TO ITS NEIGHBORS. ONE OF THE IMPROVEMENTS IS TO WORK WITH THE STAIRWELLS AND ELEVATOR TOWER  O THEM UP TO MORE NATURAL LIGHT, MORE WINDOWS. THE MILLER STREET ENTRANCE, THERE'S A PEDESTRIAN ENTRANCE. RIGHT NOW YOU HAVE TO GO DOWN SOME STAIRS TO ACTUALLY GET TO THE STAIRS. WE'LL BE RECONFIGURING THAT, SO YOU'LL ENTER THE STAIRS AT GRADE, AND THERE WILL BE A COVERED SHELTER AREA AWAY FROM THE RAIN AND SO FORTH. WE WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE HELP WE RECEIVED AT THE DESIGN REVIEW BOARD. MANY OF THE COMMENTS SPOKE ABOUT HOW TO AMPLIFY THAT THE ENTRANCE TO THE GARAGE IS AT ANN STREET,E THAT INSIGHT WITH METAL PANELS THAT ARE THAT AS THE FRONT OF THE GARAGE, AND THEN ALSO FROM UNDER THE OVERHANG, F DARK, THE RECOMMENDATION IS TO ADD SOME ARCHITECTURAL LIGHTING, WHICH WE ARE GOING TO DO. THERE WILL ALSO BE NEW SIGNAGE, AND ONE OF THE IMPROVEMENTS THAT I'M HAPPY ABOUT, THE CITY HAS SOLD PART OF THE ROOFTOP TO A Y ANTENNAS CLAD TO THE OUTSIDE OF THE GARAGE. WITH THIS NEW ROOFTOP, WE'LL BE ABLE TO PUT THAT TELECOM EQUIPMENT ON A TOWER, WHICH CAN BE THEN HIDDEN FROM WHAT PEDESTRIANS SEE AT THE STREET LEVEL, THAT WILL HELP, I THINK ALSO, WITH JUST THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF THAT GARAGE. IT'S ALSO A CHANCE TO TAKE A E E BETTER. AGAIN, BACK TO THE '80s, THE GARAGE WAS NOT DESIGNED WITH AS MUCH THOUGHT TO SUSTAINABILITY, SO TO THE EXTENT WE CAN, WE ARE GOING TO BE INFILTRATING, AND I'M GOING TO ASK MIKE TO COME U WE HAVE THREE PUBLIC SPOTS AND WE WOULD BE ADDING 20 TO THAT, AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE CITY WOULD LIKE TO CLAIM 13 OF THOSE FOR NEW FLEET VEHICLES THAT WOULD BE CHARGING IN THE GARAGE. WE ALSO HEARD FROM A DESIGN REVIEW BOARD WHAT ABOUT AN OVERHANG AREA. THE GARAGE WAS DESIGNED IN THE '80s FOR RETAIL USE. THE D.D.A. BOARD AT THIS POINT IS NOT INTERESTED IN PURSUING THAT BUILD-OUT. IT'S FAIRLY EXPENSIVE, BUT AS PART OF THE PROJECT, WE ANTICIPATE WE'LL BE REVISITING THAT QUESTION. SO WE'LL BE PREPARING FOR THAT EVENTUAL BUILD-OUT. I'M GOING TO ASK MIKE TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE STORMWATER MANAGEMENT.
02:50:56.214: >> HELLO. I'M WITH THE W.G.I. AND -- YEAH...  OKAY. THANKS. WE DID ANALYZE A LOT OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS FOR STORMWATER MANAGEMENT. WE SETTLED ON TO. FIRST OF ALL, THE STRUCTURE IS BUILT PRETTY MUCH LOT LINE TO LOT LINE, SO THERE IS NO SITE THAT YOU COULD HAVE INDEPENDENT STORMWATER MANAGEMENT. WE ARE GOING TO PUT A PERMEABLE PAVERS, A STRIP OF PERMEABLE PAVERS DOWN THE PUBLIC ALLEY, WHICH WILL ACCOMMODATE A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE, NOT A HUGE PERCENTAGE, BUT A PERCENTAGE OF SOME OF THE STORMWATER, AND THEN WE'LL ALSO HAVE THE GREEN ROOF THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE PUTTING ON THE MILLER STREET, MILLER AVENUE PORTION OF THE STRUCTURE. THIS IS JUST THE SITE PLAN, AND MOSTLY, IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS ON THAT, BUT IT -- AT THE NORTH END, WE ARE SHOWING THE ADDITIONAL BIKE PARKING, AND ALSO THE RENOVATED ELEVATOR STAIR TOWER, AND THEN TOWARDS THE SOUTH, DOWN ON THE SOUTHWEST WILL BE THE NEW ELEVATOR TOWER. I THINK THE APPEARANCE IS -- IT'S SUBTLE, BUT I THINK IT'S A GREAT IMPROVEMENT. THESE ARE THE ELEVATIONS THAT YOU COULD CERTAINLY TAKE A LOOK AT. THE METAL PANELS ARE REALLY ISOLATED OVER ANN STREET TO HIGHLIGHT THAT. OTHER THAN THAT, IT'S GOING TO BE SUSTAINED PRECAST AND ALSO STAINING THE EXISTING PRECAST TO HAVE A UNIFORM LOOK ON THE OUTSIDE. I THINK THIS SHOWS UP A LITTLE BIT BETTER ON THE RENDERINGS, AND AS YOU CAN SEE, ON THE RIGHT SIDE IS THE GREEN ROOF THAT WE REFERRED TO ALONG WITH THE STAINING AND THE BRICK. THE BRICK IS GOING TO STAY WITH -- AT ONE POINT, WE HAD TAKEN A LOOK AT MODIFYING THAT AS WELL. I THINK PROBABLY ONE OF THE BETTER IMAGES IS GOING TO BE THE BEFORE AND AFTER, AND -- OR AFTER AND BEFORE, DEPENDING ON HOW YOU LOOK AT IT, BUT THE LOWER PICTURES ARE EXISTING PHOTOS, AND THE ABOVE RENDERINGS ARE TAKEN FROM THOSE SAME PERSPECTIVES. AND THAT'S --
02:53:18.623: >> THAT'S IT.
02:53:19.323: >> WE ARE VERY HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS.
02:53:23.594: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  THANK YOU. AND NOW WE'LL HEAD OVER TO MS. THATCHER FOR A STAFF REPORT.
02:53:32.770: >> SO, IN A NUTSHELL, THE WAYS THAT THIS PETITION DOES NOT MEET PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS ARE THAT IT DEVIATES FROM STORM WATER CODE AND THE RATIO -- AND NO STREET WALL IS PROPOSED AT THE END OF ANY OF THE STREET FRONTAGES. THE WALLS ARE CURRENTLY AT NINE STORIES.
02:54:04.368: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  THANK YOU. AT THIS TIME I WOULD LIKE TO OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING. IF THERE'S ANYONE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION, PLEASE COME FORWARD, STATE YOUR NAME, AND YOU'LL HAVE UP TO THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
02:54:19.717: >> I'M CHARLOTTE DONL  AND I LIVE ON ASHLEY, AND SO I LIVE IN THE CONDOS THAT ARE RIGHT ON THE CORNER, SORT OF ACROSS FROM T THE -- SO WHEN I LOOK OUT THE FLOOR FROM MY WINDOW, I SEE LIGHTS FROM THE GARAGE, AND THAT'S ONE OF MY MAJOR CONCERNS, IS THAT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A NINE-STORY GARAGE WITH ALL OF THESE LIGHTS, AND I'M GOING TO SEE MORE LIGHTS, AT NIGHT ESPECIALLY, BECAUSE THEY ARE BRIGHT. THE OTHER THING IS THAT THERE IS A LOT OF AIR POLLUTION AROUND THERE BECAUSE OF ALL OF THE CARS GOING IN AND OUT. THE OTHER THING IS NOISE. SO, THOSE ARE SORT OF THE THREE THINGS I'M CONCERNED ABOUT, IS THE LIGHTING AND THE NOISE AND AIR POLLUTION.
02:55:12.870: >> THANK YOU.
02:55:24.314: >> HI. JOYCE STEVENS. ACTUALLY, I WOULD LIKE TO TALK ABOUT HER PREDICAMENT, BECAUSE I SEEM TO BE MORE UPSET ABOUT IT THAN SHE IS. SHE OWNS TWO UNITS. ONE UNIT, ALL HER WINDOWS FACE THE HOTEL. THAT'S HER VIEW. AND HER CORNER UNIT, SOON WHEN THAT PARKING STRUCTURE GOES UP HIGHER, SHE HAS A VIEW OF THE PARKING STRUCTURE AND THE MARRIOTT. FROM THE THIRD FLOOR TO THE 10th FLOOR, FOR THOSE PARTICULAR UNITS THAT ARE CONSISTENT ALL THE WAY UP, THAT'S WHAT THEY LOOK AT, THE PARKING LOT AND THE MARRIOTT. A LOT OF MONEY WAS INVESTED IN PEOPLE BUYING IN THIS BUILDING. I LOVE ANN ARBOR. I LOVE THE CULTURAL THINGS I CAN DO. I CAN WALK ANYWHERE. WE HAVE A PARKING STRUCTURE NOW BLOCKING. WE HAVE A CITY PARKING LOT ACROSS HURON THAT PROBABLY WILL HAVE A BUILDING ON IT   SOMEDAY WE HAVE A DEVELOPER THAT OWNS THE FIRST AND SECOND FLOOR -- EXCUSE ME. IT'S PASSED MY BEDTIME -- THAT OWNS THE FIRST AND SECOND FLOOR AND ALSO HAS BOUGHT ALL OF THE LAND AROUND IT, EXCEPT ONE LOT IN THE CORNER OF FIRST AND ANN. AND HE WAS SHOWN A PICTURE, A PROFESSIONAL PICTURE OF A TWO-HIGH-RISE BUILDINGS GOING ON, AND THEY WANTED HIS LOT, BECAUSE THEY WOULD BUILD IT, AND HE WOULD BE SQUASHED BETWEEN THESE TWO MASSIVE BUILDINGS. SO, THAT'S THE PREDICAMENT WE ARE IN AT 11 NORTH ASHLEY. WE CAN BE TOTALLY SHUT OUT FROM ANY KIND OF VISIBLE SIGHTS FROM OUR WINDOWS, REGARDLESS OF WHAT FLOOR, AND WE ARE CONCERNED. THANK YOU.
02:57:30.573: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION? OKAY. SEEING NO ONE, I WILL CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING, AND I WILL READ THE MOTION. WHEREAS THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR IS DIRECTED TO OBTAIN COMMENTS AND SUGGESTIONS FROM APPROPRIATE CITY DEPARTMENTS WITH REGARD TO CERTAIN PUBLIC PROJECTS MEETING PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS; AND WHEREAS SUCH PROJECTS ARE TO BE REVIEWED BY THE CITY PLANNING COMMISSION PRIOR TO CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL; RESOLVED, THAT THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION FINDS THAT THE ANN ASHLEY PARKING STRUCTURE EXPANSION ADHERES TO CITY PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS WITH THE FOLLOWING EXCEPTIONS:  ONE, STORM WATER:  THE PETITION DOES NOT MEET STORMWATER INFILL REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS. TWO, ZONING, THE PETITION EXCEEDS THE FLOOR AREA RATIO MAXIMUM REQUIREMENTS OF 400% OR 700% WITH PREMIUMS BY PROPOSING A 791% FLOOR AREA RATIO, AND THREE, ZONING, NO STREETWALL IS PROPOSED ON ANY STREET FRONTAGES, MOVED BY COMMISSIONER MILLS, SECOND BY COMMISSIONER WEATHERBEE. COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN?
02:58:44.982: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN:  THANK YOU, CHAIR. FIRST A PROCEDURAL QUESTION FOR MR. LENART. I UNDERSTAND MY ROLE AS A CITY COUNCIL MEMBER, DOWN THE ROAD. I FEEL AS THOUGH MS. THATCHER DID A GREAT JOB OF OUTLINING ON PAPER WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THIS AND WHAT OUR PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS ARE. OUR ROLE AS PLANNING COMMISSIONER, HOW DO WE EXPAND ON THAT? WHAT IS --
02:59:10.374: >> IN THIS CASE, YOUR ROLE AS PLANNING COMMISSIONER IS TO ADVISE --
02:59:14.911: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN:  ON THE APPROPRIATENESS?
02:59:15.945: >> PLANNING MANAGER:  ON THE -- ON JUST THAT, THE EVALUATION OF DOES THIS MEET PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS, AND IF IT DOESN'T, IN WHAT WAYS DOES IT NOT, AND SO IF YOU AGREE WITH STAFF'S ASSESSMENT, YOU WOULD PASS THIS MOTION, IF FOR SOME REASON YOU THOUGHT THAT WE WERE INCORRECT IN OUR ASSESSMENT OF IT MEETING THIS, THEN YOU MIGHT MODIFY THAT IN SOME WAYS OR BRING UP OTHER ISSUES, AND THEN THAT INFORMATION WOULD BE PRESENTED ULTIMATELY NOT AS A REQUEST OF SITE PLAN APPROVAL TO THE CITY COUNCIL, BUT FOR INFORMATION IN THE CONTEXT OF WHETHER OR NOT TO PROCEED WITH FUNDING THIS CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT.
02:59:52.815: >> OKAY. UNDERSTOOD. THANK YOU. I THINK -- I MEAN, I THINK MS. THATCHER AND MR. LENART DID A GREAT JOB OF OUTLINING WHERE THIS DEVIATES FROM OUR PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS. I GUESS I WOULD -- BECAUSE THIS WOULD BE A REZONING OF SORTS, I JUST WANTED TO RAISE MAYBE A FEW MORE STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS, LAND USE ELEMENTS TO THE CONVERSATION THAT WERE COMMENTED ON IN EITHER THE PRESENTATION OR THE STAFF REVIEW, SO IN THE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE DESIGN REVIEW BOARD, ANOTHER BODY THAT'S ADVISING ON THIS, THE -- I GUESS I'LL START WITH KIND OF THE DESIGN REVIEW BOARD COMMENTS AND SEE HOW,IF ANY, THE PLANS HAVE CHANGED BASED ON THEIR FEEDBACK. WE HAVE TRIED TO GET D.R.B. INPUT EARLIER INTO THE PROCESS IN THE HOPES THAT IT WILL INFLUENCE THE QUALITY OF DESIGN EARLY, WHEN THOSE PLANS CAN BE CHANGED IN A COST-EFFECTIVE MANNER. ONE OF THE BIG COMMENTS THAT I THINK IS MOST CRITICAL HERE IS BREAKING UP THE MASSING, WAS A CONVERSATION. I BELIEVE THEIR COMMENT WAS THE MOVEMENT OF THE MASSING, AND I JUST WANTED TO -- I MEAN, WE ARE STILL LOOKING AT A FAIRLY MONOLITHIC BUILDING WITH SOME DIFFERENTIATION AT THE STAIRWELLS, ELEVATOR WELLS, AND THEN ON ANN. ANY OTHER THOUGHT FROM MS. PAULA OR THE ARCHITECT ON HOW TO BREAK UP THE MASSING? BECAUSE IT'S NEARLY 800 --
03:01:36.753: >> WE WENT BACK TO THE DESIGN REVIEW BOARD A COUPLE OF TIMES. I DON'T REMEMBER WHICH MEETING THAT CAME FROM, BUT WE FOCUSED A FAIR AMOUNT OF TIME WORKING WITH LOUVRES ON THE OUTER PORTION OF THE GARAGE, METAL LOUVRES TO HELP BRING UP THAT MASSING, AND THE EFFORT WAS NOT SEEN AS SUCCESSFUL.
03:01:57.140: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN:  WOULD THAT BE THE ALUMINUM VAIL THAT WAS REFERRED TO?
03:02:01.811: >> YEAH, I THINK THAT'S A GOOD DESCRIPTION. IT'S JUST A TOUGH, BIG GARAGE WITH A LOT OF HORIZONTALS. THE LOUVRES WAS ONE EXPLANATION. I HAVE GOT MR. MOONEY HERE. WE TRIED ALSO SOME THINS NEAR THE ANN STREET PORTION TO BREAK -- ALSO NOT SUCCESSFUL. MAYBE I'M NOT DESCRIBING IT WELL.
03:02:23.567: >> YEAH, YOU'RE DOING A FINE JOB.
03:02:25.602: >> WE HEARD THE POINT WELL. IT'S JUST THAT WORKING WITH THE -- WE ARE WORKING WITH A GARAGE WHERE IT'S NOT EASY TO FIGURE OUT A GOOD SOLUTION AND ANSWER TO THAT CONCERN.
03:02:37.347: >> YEAH, WE DID GO IN TWICE, AND THE FIRST -- THE FIRST ATTEMPT WAS HORIZONTAL METAL LOUVRES, WHICH THEY, THE ARCHITECTS ON THE BOARD THOUGHT IT SUCCESSFULLY REDUCED THE MASS, THE APPEARANCE OF THE MASS, BUT THEY THOUGHT IT WAS MORE IMPORTANT TO SPEND MONEY MORE ON THE PEDESTRIAN ACCESS OR PEDESTRIAN EXPERIENCE RATHER THAN SPEND MONEY ON THE MASS REDUCTION, SO, THEY RECOMMENDED MORE EMPHASIS ON THE ANN STREET OR ANN STREET ACCESS POINTS, WHICH WE ADDRESSED, AS WELL AS SOME BASICALLY IVY ALONG THE ASHLEY STREET, SO -- AND THEN ALSO THE GREEN ROOFS. SO THOSE ADDRESSED THOSE PARTICULAR CONCERNS. THE MASSING APPEARED TO BE LESS OF A CONSIDERATION OF THE BOARD.
03:03:25.494: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN:  SO WE ARE WORKING WITHIN THE CONSTRAINTS OF BUDGET NUMBERS THAT HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED, AND THOSE WERE THE TRADEOFFS ARTICULATED TO THEM AND STILL STAND AS THE TRADEOFFS?
03:03:35.805: >> I AM NOT SURE IT WAS SO MUCH A BUDGET AS TRYING TO FIND A WAY TO WORK WITH THIS EXISTING BUILDING. MAYBE DAN, YOU COULD DO A BETTER JOB THAN I'M DOING.
03:03:45.114: >> WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME TRYING TO REDUCE THE MASS, FOR SURE, AND UL THE DESIGN REVIEW BOARD WAS MORE IN FAVOR OF MORE OF THE SAME WOULD BE LESS OBTRUSIVE THAN TRYING TO HIGHLIGHT MUCH OF ANY OF IT, AND WHEN WE BROUGHT BACK A SOLUTION OF BREAKING UP THE STREET, THERE WAS TALK ABOUT MAKING THE BLOCKS FEEL LIKE BLOCKS, WITH THIS MASS COMING ACROSS THE STREET, AND TRYING TO ARTICULATE PERHAPS THE 24-FOOT RHYTHM YOU MIGHT SEE DOWNTOWN, AND WE LOOKED AT THINGS LIKE THAT, AND ULTIMATELY THEY DIDN'T REALLY LIKE THAT EITHER, AND WE SETTLED ON LETS MAKE THE BLOCKS LOOK DIFFERENT SO WE CAN HIGHLIGHT THE ENTRANCE, AND SO YOU CAN DEFINITELY SEE THAT THE ROAD PATTERN GOES THROUGH, AND THAT THE BUILDING APPEARS TO BE PART ON ONE BLOCK AND PART ON ANOTHER BLOCK, AND WE FELT LIKE THERE WAS A LOT OF FEEDBACK AND BACK AND FORTH, AND ULTIMATELY LIKE ANY NEGOTIATION, EVERYBODY GOT SOME OF WHAT THEY WANTED BUT NOT NECESSARILY ALL OF WHAT THEY WANTED, BUT IT SEEMED VERY FRUITFUL.
03:04:51.314: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN:  OKAY. I APPRECIATE THAT. AND I THINK IT SOUNDS AS THOUGH A LOT OF THE CONVERSATION HAS REVOLVED AROUND ARCHITECTURAL ELEMENTS OF HOW TO BREAK UP THE MASSING. WOULD THERE BE INTEREST OR APPETITE FOR SPEAKING WITH THE PUBLIC ARTS COMMISSION, FOR EXAMPLE, ON OTHER WAYS TO BREAK UP MASSING?
03:05:12.902: >> WE HAD CONVERSATIONS INITIALLY JUST INTERNALLY. WE WANTED TO BRING THIS TO COUNCIL TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE A PROJECT, AND THEN THAT BEING SAID, DEVELOP AN R.F.P. TO DO A COMMISSIONING, AND THERE WERE ONE OR TWO PLACES THE DESIGN REVIEW BOARD CALLED OUT, PARTICULARLY ON THE LOWER PHOTO, I THINK THAT'S ASHLEY STREET, THEY ARE AGAIN RECOMMENDING TRYING TO, TO AMPLIFY THE PEDESTRIAN EXPERIENCE, DEVELOPING A PIECE OF ARTWORK THAT WOULD MAKE IT INTERESTING TO DO THAT WALK, AND THAT'S AN EXAMPLE. THERE'S ALSO AN IDEA THAT ON THE FACADE THAT FACES TOWARDS MAIN STREET ANOTHER PLACE WHERE ART COULD GO, BECAUSE THE EXPERIENCE THAT YOU HAVE AS A PEDESTRIAN ISN'T JUST ADJACENT TO THE BUILDING, BUT FROM MAIN STREET, YOU CAN SEE THE BUILDING, AND THAT WAS ANOTHER PLACE THEY RECOMMENDED WE PROVIDE TO THE ARTS COMMISSION SORT OF AN EASEL WHERE ART COULD GO, SO ASSUMING THE PROJECT MOVES FORWARD, WE HAVE AT LEAST THOSE TWO IDEAS, WHICH ARE GREAT IDEAS.
03:06:16.165: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN:  OKAY. THANK YOU. SPEAKING TO THE DRAWING EYES DOWN AND ENHANCING THE PEDESTRIAN EXPERIENCE, THE KIND OF TUNNEL THAT'S CREATED ON ANN BY THE OVERPASS, THOUGHT INTO HOW TO ENHANCE THAT AND BRIGHTEN IT IN ANYWAY?
03:06:39.755: >> WE HAVE TWO IDEAS TO REALLY HANDLE WHAT'S GOING ON THERE, AND ONE IS DURING THE DAYTIME, THERE'S JUST NOT ENOUGH LIGHT THERE, SO WE ARE GOING TO VERY MUCH SO ENHANCE THE DAYTIME LIGHTING. WE ARE NOT ONLY GOING TO DO THAT AT ANN. WE ARE DOING THAT AT MILLER AS WELL. AS YOU WALK DOWN MILLER, IT'S A LITTLE DARK IN THERE, AND WE ARE GOING TO TRY AND ILLUMINATE THAT SUCH THAT THE RESISTANCE FACTOR WALKING IN FRONT OF THERE IS A LITTLE BIT MORE PLEASANT. ALSO UNDERNEATH OF ANN STREET, ON THE LEFT-HAND SIDE, YOU CAN SEE KIND OF THE ZIGZAGGING LIGHTS UNDERNEATH. THEY WILL BE ADDED AS AN ACCENT FEATURE TO JUST ADD A LITTLE BIT MORE VISUAL INTEREST INTO THE AREA, BUT THAT'S BEEN A CONCERN OF OURS ALL ALONG, TOO, TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ADDRESS THE LIGHTING.
03:07:30.172: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN:  OKAY. AND THOSE WILL BE WHITE LIGHTS UNDERNEATH?
03:07:34.210: >> THEY WILL BE WHITE LIGHTS. THEY MAY HAVE THE CAPABILITY OF BEING COLORED LIGHTS, BUT THE IDEA RIGHT NOW IS THAT THEY WOULD BE WHITE.
03:07:41.250: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN:  OKAY. AND I'M CERTAINLY OPEN TO THEM HAVING THE ABILITY TO CHANGE COLORS. I THINK OF THE TUNNEL AT O'HARE AS BEING A BIG DRAW. OBVIOUSLY NOT TO THE EXTENT THAT IT WOULD BE A DANGER TO DRIVERS.
03:07:57.566: >> RIGHT. WE DON'T WANT TO BE DISTRACTING DRIVERS, BUT THE IDEA OF SLOW MOVING LIGHTS IS AN IDEA THAT WE HAVE GOT TO GO A LITTLE BIT FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD. WE DON'T WANT TO TURN INTO VEGAS, BUT WE DO WANT TO ADD VISUAL INTEREST. THOSE IDEAS ARE STILL ON THE BOARD.
03:08:14.950: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN:  IT'S PROBABLY VERY EASY TO GO OVERBOARD, GO TOO FAR.
03:08:19.621: >> IT WOULD BE REALLY EASY TO GO OVERBOARD, BUT THE FIXTURE HAS THE ABILITY TO DO COLOR CHANGING, BUT WHO HAS CONTROL OF THE DIAL IS PROBABLY WHAT YOU WERE INTERESTED THERE TO MAKE SURE IT'S NOT TOO CRAZY.
03:08:38.707: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN: TURNING TO THE STORMWATER, THE STRUCTURE IS WHAT THE STRUCTURE IS TODAY. CAN YOU SHARE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO A DROP OF WATER THAT LANDS ON THE STRUCTURE NOW AND HOW THAT WILL CHANGE, IF ANY, WITH THIS ADDITION?
03:09:00.062: >> YEAH, CURRENTLY, ALL FLOOR LEVELS, THE ROOF LEVEL ALL DRAIN INTO THE STORM SYSTEM, AND ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THAT WE ARE DOING IS THE ROOF LEVEL WILL BE THE ONLY THING THAT DRAINS INTO THE STORM SYSTEM. ALL COVERED LEVELS WILL THEN GO INTO THE SANITARY SYSTEM, WHICH IS WHAT IS IN LINE     WHAT WE DO WITH THE PARKING STRUCTURES. THE -- AS FAR AS THE STORMWATER MANAGEMENT, THE -- WE DID EXPLORE SEVERAL DIFFERENT OPTIONS FOR INFILTRATION, AND MOST OF THOSE ENDED UP IN THE RIGHT-OF-WAY, WHICH WERE COUNTER TO WHAT WE COULD ACHIEVE ON THE PROJECT, AND THEREFORE DETERMINED TO BE INFEASIBLE, SO AS FAR AS THE WATER ON THE ROOF LEVEL, WHICH IS REALLY THE STORMWATER, IT'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO GO INTO THE STORM SYSTEM. THE WATER THAT GOES, AS YOU CAN SEE, THE GREEN ROOF AREA, THAT WILL DETAIN A LITTLE UNDER A HUNDRED CUBIC FEET OF WATER, SO NOT A LOT, BUT IT'S NOT INSIGNIFICANT. AND THE WATER THAT FALLS INTO THE ALLEY WILL GO INTO THE INFILTRATION, BUT THE WATER WILL NOT BE DIVERTED FROM THE ROOF INTO THE ALLEY.
03:10:22.974: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN:  OKAY, THANK YOU. AND THEN THE LAST ITEM THAT CAUGHT MY ATTENTION, FOR NOW, WAS I HEARD THERE'S A PROPOSAL FOR 20 ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING STATIONS, AND THEN THAT THE CITY WANTS TO UTILIZE 13 OF THOSE.
03:10:44.896: >> I MET WITH DR. MISSY STULTS ABOUT A WEEK AND A HALF AGO, AND SHE SHARED WITH ME THAT SOME PLANNING HAS BEEN GOING ON INSIDE THE CITY ABOUT ITS FLEET, AND THAT WE ARE COINCIDENTALLY DEVELOPING THESE E.V. CHARGING SPACES, IS COINCIDENTAL TO THE COMMITMENT THAT HER OFFICE HAS TO PURSUING A CLEANER FLEET OF VEHICLES FOR THE CITY, SO NESTING 13 OF THEM IN THIS GARAGE WAS PUT FORWARD JUST VERY RECENTLY.
03:11:14.192: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN:  OKAY. I GUESS MY THOUGHT THERE, AND PERHAPS THIS IS A BETTER CONVERSATION TO HAVE AT THE COUNCIL TABLE, I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHICH HAT TO WEAR TONIGHT, AND I THINK THERE'S APPROPRIATE CONVERSATION TO HAVE AS A PLANNING COMMISSIONER AND THEN A LOT MORE CONVERSATION TO HAVE AROUND THE NEED, THE TIMELINE AND THE BUDGET AS A CITY COUNCIL MEMBER. BUT I GUESS I'LL JUST INTRODUCE THE THINKING THAT I THINK IT'S A FANTASTIC VALUE TO ADD TO THE COMMUNITY TO ADD 20 E.V. CHARGING STATIONS. I WOULD LOVE TO SEE US BE ABLE TO DO 33, ONLY BECAUSE I DON'T WANT CITY VEHICLES TO BE COMPETING WITH COMMUNITY MEMBERS, AND AS MUCH AS I WANT US TO ACCOMPLISH OUR GOALS AS A CITY IN OUR GREEN FLEETS IN MOVING TO CARBON NEUTRALITY, I DON'T WANT THAT TO BE AT THE LOSS OF COMMUNITY MEMBERS' ABILITY TO CHARGE THEIR OWN VEHICLES.
03:12:16.221: >> YEAH, AND I'M GOING TO ASK MIKE ABOUT THE ELECTRICAL CAPACITY. THAT'S REALLY THE QUESTION, AND NOW'S THE TIME TO BE BRINGING IT.
03:12:22.961: >> YEAH. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW IS WHAT'S THE NEXT STEP UP, BECAUSE THERE'S QUITE A BIT OF CAPACITY REQUIRED, ELECTRICAL CAPACITY REQUIRED FOR THE CHARGING STATION, SO WE ARE PLANNING FOR 20 RIGHT NOW, BUT WE ARE ALSO EVALUATING WHAT AN ADDITIONAL 20 OR ADDITIONAL 30 CHARGING STATIONS WOULD TAKE, POWER WISE, AND WE'D LIKE TO ADD THAT TO THE FACILITY AT THIS POINT, SO WE ARE EVALUATING THAT RIGHT NOW. WHETHER THEY ARE PUT IN NOW OR WHETHER THEY ARE PUT IN FIVE YEARS FROM NOW, WE ARE ANTICIPATING THAT THEY WILL BE NEEDED, SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE CAPACITY FOR THAT.
03:12:59.465: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN:  OKAY.
03:13:01.032: >> AND JUST A PIECE ABOUT IT, WHEN WE HAVE HAD THIS CONVERSATION, WE HAVE NOW GROWN PASS THE POINT WHERE E.V.s NEED TO BE PUT RIGHT AT THE FRONT DOOR. THAT WAS A CENTRAL WAY OF ENCOURAGING ELECTRIC VEHICLE USE. WE HAVE PRESENTED TO DR. STULTS THE IDEA THAT IF THEY ARE THERE, THEY SHOULD BE ON THE ROOF, NOT AT THE NESTING OF THE FRONT DOOR. PATRONS SHOULD HAVE THE BEST PARKING IN THE GARAGE, AND THAT IF CITY VEHICLES ARE IN THE GARAGE, THEY WOULD BE UP, AND IN PARTICULAR, IF WE COULD CONNECT THE E.V. CHARGING WITH THE SOLAR PANELS THAT ARE GOING UP THERE. IF THAT IS THE CASE, THEN THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE THE GARAGE WITH OUR COMMUNITIES, BECAUSE THE CITY VEHICLES ARE GONE DURING THE DAY, WHICH IS WHEN THE GARAGE, AT LEAST AT THIS POINT, IS SEEING MOST OF ITS DEMAND. IN THE EVENINGS, WHEN THE CARS COME BACK, SAY AT 5:00, AND GO BACK TO THEIR NESTS, IT'S LIKELY THE DEMAND FOR THE E.V.s WON'T BE AS STRONG, AT LEAST AT THIS POINT. WHEN OTHER LOTS ARE DEVELOPED, THAT MAY CHANGE, BUT AT LEAST BY NESTING THEM AWAY FROM THE FRONT DOOR ALLOWS FOR DIFFERENT USES THAN WE ARE SEEING TODAY, WHERE THE E.V.s ARE AS CLOSE TO THE FRONT DOOR AS POSSIBLE.
03:14:20.946: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN:  I APPRECIATE THAT, AND I APPRECIATE PRECEDENCE GOING TO PAYING CUSTOMERS OF THE PARKING SYSTEM. I GUESS MY ONLY PUSHBACK OR CHALLENGE WOULD BE, YOU KNOW, I DON'T -- AND JUST AS AN EXAMPLE, I DON'T WANT 15 MINUTES OF A COMMUNITY STANDARDS OFFICER'S SHIFT GOING TO DRIVING DOWN THE PARKING STRUCTURE AND ANOTHER 15 MINUTES GOING TO DRIVING UP. YOU KNOW, THEY HAVE 29 SQUARE MILES OF THE CITY TO TAKE CARE OF, AND WE NEED THEM OUT ON THE ROADS, YOU KNOW, SERVING THE PEOPLE. SO THAT WOULD BE THE ONLY CHALLENGE THAT I HAVE THERE. BUT I GUESS I'LL LEAVE IT THERE FOR NOW. I DO THINK, YOU KNOW, IF THIS WERE A PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT AND WE -- AND WE WERE TO GRANT THIS KIND OF ACCESS F.A.R. WE WOULD PROBABLY ASK FOR A LOT. I THINK WE'D GET A LOT HERE, AND I -- BUT I ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT IT IS THE PARKING CUSTOMERS WHO ARE GOING TO BE PAYING FOR THIS IN THE LONG RUN, AND I REPRESENT A LOT OF THEM, SO IT'S A BALANCE OF HOW MUCH DO WE ASK FOR, BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY, WE PICK UP THE TAB AS WELL. SO...  I'LL LEAVE IT THERE FOR NOW.
03:15:50.636: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN: COMMISSIONER MILLS?
03:15:51.537: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  I'M GLAD TO FOLLOW ON AFTER COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN, BECAUSE I SHARED THE SAME THOUGHT ON THE E.V.s, IN THAT IF IT'S A NET 7, I DON'T KNOW HOW -- THERE'S GOT TO BE DEMAND ALREADY FOR THAT. MY OFFICE MATE HAS AN E.V. AND SHE IS CONSTANTLY CHECKING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE SHE CAN PARK IT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY AND MOVE IT. SO I THINK THE IDEA OF TRYING TO MAKE THIS ADDITIVE RATHER THAN REPLACING WOULD BE HELPFUL, AND I'M KIND OF TORN ON THIS IDEA. I DON'T THINK THAT THEY NEED TO BE RIGHT BY THE FRONT DOOR, RIGHT, OR RIGHT BY THE ENTRANCE, BUT THIS IS A BIG GARAGE, AND TO CIRCLE ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP, I THINK THERE'S KIND OF A FINE BALANCE, RIGHT, BETWEEN NOT HAVING IT BE SUPER CONVENIENT BUT ALSO NOT MAKING IT BE SUPER INCONVENIENT, SO I DON'T KNOW WHERE I COME DOWN ON THAT, BUT THAT'S KIND OF SOME FOOD FOR THOUGHT, ESPECIALLY AS YOU CONSIDER IT GOING FORWARD. I'M CURIOUS ABOUT HOW THIS ROOF WORKS WITH SOLAR AND GREEN ROOF, SO CAN YOU SHOW US THAT?
03:17:03.241: >> IN THE UPPER RIGHT, THE GREEN ROOF IS ONLY OVER THAT PORTION THAT'S SHOWN RIGHT THERE, WHERE YOU CAN SEE THE VEGETATION. THE SOLAR, THE CAPACITY -- STRUCTURAL CAPACITY ON THE ROOF OF THE PARKING DECK UP AT THE VERY TOP IS -- WILL SUPPORT THE SOLAR PANELS AND THE FRAME TO HOLD IT. SO, THEY ARE IN TWO DIFFERENT LOCATIONS.
03:17:24.829: >> GOT IT. SO THIS IS THE STEP -- THIS STEP BACK.
03:17:28.133: >> YEAH, THIS IS JUST A FAIRLY SMALL, BUT IT'S CERTAINLY A NICE STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION, AS FAR AS THE GREEN ROOF AREA. RIGHT NOW IT'S WASTED SPACE. THERE'S NO PARKING THAT'S GOING TO BE TAKEN OUT. IT'S JUST GOING TO BE A GREEN ROOF THAT'S INSTALLED THERE.
03:17:44.382: >> I WAS GOING TO SAY, I THINK GIVEN HOW MUCH OF THE LOT THIS TAKES UP, THIS IS -- THIS IS THE ONLY PLACE THAT IT REALLY FITS, BUT IT'S BETTER THAN NOTHING. BUT, YEAH, NOW THAT I SEE -- NOW IT MAKES SENSE. I WAS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW THESE THINGS ARE COMPATIBLE, BUT WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE SAME REAL ESTATE, SO THAT'S HELPFUL. THE OTHER QUESTION THAT I HAVE IS I THINK IT WAS MORE ABOUT LIKE THE NUMBER OF SPACES IN THE EXISTING SURFACE PARKING LOTS THAT YOU'RE REPLACING, SO HOW MANY ARE WE ADDING VERSUS NOT, BECAUSE --
03:18:20.685: >> SO, I HAVEN'T DONE THE COUNT, BUT I COULD CERTAINLY WORK WITH STAFF, AND WE COULD DO SOME TOTALS. IF YOU LOOK AT THE NEAR VICINITY, WE HAVE THE ENTIRE BROWN BLOCK. WE HAVE THE KEY BANK PARKING LOT. WE HAVE GOT THE OLD WHIFFLE TREE LOT, ALTHOUGH WE JUST HEARD THAT MAY BE UNDER DEVELOPMENT. IF YOU GO TWO BLOCKS, YOU'RE AT THE CLINE LOT. YOU CAN GET DOWN TO THE 4:15 LOT. THE GOAL OF THIS IS NOT TO BE ADDITIVE. THE GOAL IS TO SHIFT THIS TO THE GARAGE, AND I THINK THAT YOU PROBABLY HEAR IT TOO, THAT AS DEVELOPMENT COMES IN, ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT PEOPLE HAVE IS REALLY WHERE'S THAT PARKING GOING TO GO. IT'S GOING TO GO INTO THE NEIGHBORHOODS, AND SO WE ARE TRYING TO GET OUT AHEAD OF THAT, AND I'M TRYING TO GUIDE THE DEVELOPMENT THAT WE HOPE WILL HAPPEN, AND THIS IS WHERE THE CONNECTION TO THE FIRST AND ASHLEY PROJECT COME IN. WE ARE TRYING TO GUIDE IT IN A WAY WHERE WE AS A COMMUNITY WANT TO SEE IT GOING, SO TO HAVE THE PARKING IN A CITY GARAGE ALLOWS US POTENTIALLY TO HAVE FEWER CURB CUTS. IT ALLOWS US TO MANAGE IT BETTER, BECAUSE THE SAME PARKING SPACE MAY HAVE ONE OR TWO USERS, AS OPPOSED TO A PARKING SPACE THAT'S OWNED PRIVATELY. THE GOAL IS, IN FACT, TO NOT BE ADDITIVE.
03:19:40.465: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  I THINK WE ONLY GOT ONE LETTER ON THIS, BUT I THINK THE POINT IS PRETTY WELL TAKEN IN THAT WE ARE TRYING TO DISCOURAGE DRIVING, SO WHY ARE WE ADDING ADDITIONAL PARKING SPACES. THAT WAS THE QUESTION THAT I HAD COMING INTO THIS, AND YOU ADDRESSED IT IN THE PRESENTATION, BY SAYING THIS IS TO REPLACE THOSE SURFACE LOTS, BUT KNOWING THE MATH ON THAT IS DEFINITELY VERY HELPFUL, SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO TRY TO GET THOSE NUMBERS TO COME TOGETHER. THE OTHER QUESTION THAT I HAVE IS ON LIGHTING, BECAUSE THAT IS ONE OF THE DIFFERENCES IN THE SURFACE LOT, ESPECIALLY WHERE THAT LIGHTING IS. SO SOME OF IT IS THE LIGHTING IN THE GARAGES, THAT ARE NOW KIND OF AT EYE LEVEL, DEPENDING ON WHERE YOUR NEIGHBORING HOUSE IS, SO WHAT DO YOU GUYS KIND OF DO TO SHIELD THAT FROM LIKE TRESPASS, EFFECTIVELY, OFF OF THE PROPERTY, AND FROM PEOPLE ACTUALLY SEEING THE BULBS, BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW IF YOU ARE AWARE, WE ARE WORKING ON A LIGHTING ORDINANCE GENERALLY, RIGHT?
03:20:40.692: >> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, WE ARE CHANGING ALL OF THE LIGHTS TO THE L.E.D. LIGHT FIXTURES, WILL WHICH WILL BE BOTH MOTION SENSOR, AS WELL AS DIMMABLE, SO THERE WILL BE OPTIONS AS WE MOVE ALONG. FOR INSTANCE, IN THE LIBRARY LANE STRUCTURE, WHEN TRAFFIC COMES IN, THEY LIGHT UP. SO THAT'S EVEN MUCH EASIER TO DO NOW WITH LED FIXTURES, AND ON A SIDE NOTE, BY PUTTING IN LED FIXTURES, WE DO FREE UP CAPACITY QUITE A BIT, SO WE ARE ABLE TO ADD THOSE VEHICLE CHARGING STATIONS. WE STILL NEED TO ADD A LITTLE BIT MORE CAPACITY, BUT IT'S HEADED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. SO I THINK YOU'RE STILL GOING TO BE ABLE TO SEE THE LIGHT FIXTURES, UNLESS WE PUT UP SCREENS ON THE WHOLE SIDE OF THE PARKING STRUCTURE, BUT THEY WILL BE ABLE TO -- WE WILL BE ABLE TO CONTROL THEM A LITTLE BIT BETTER THAN YOU CAN NOW, A LOT BETTER THAN YOU CAN NOW.
03:21:33.911: >> WILL THE FIXTURES THEMSELVES BE FULLY SHIELDED SO THAT PEOPLE DON'T PHYSICALLY SEE THE LIGHT BULB, RIGHT, OR IT FEELS LIKE AT LEAST ON SOME OF THE STRUCTURES, THERE'S SOMETHING THAT YOU DO ON KIND OF THE OUTSIDE ROWS THAT TRY TO LIMIT THE TRESPASS.
03:21:51.095: >> YEAH, THE -- WE'LL TAKE A LITTLE -- WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AT THE FIXTURE TYPE. I THINK ON SOME OF THE EXISTING STRUCTURES, THEY ARE ACTUALLY PHYSICALLY SHIELDED, AND THAT'S ALWAYS A POSSIBILITY ON MOST ANY TYPE OF FIXTURE. IT'S JUST A MATTER OF WHAT THE PHOTOMETRICS ARE AND IT'S JUST A DESIGN ISSUE, SO --
03:22:15.553: >> OKAY. PARTICULARLY BECAUSE WE KNOW THERE ARE RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES AROUND HERE, RIGHT, IF IT'S RIGHT NEXT TO OFFICE, IT'S JUST A DIFFERENT TIME OF DAY THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE BOTHERED, BUT WITH THAT, I THINK -- ALSO, WELL, WE ARE TRYING TO MOVE TO THIS ON PRIVATE PROPERTY, SO, AGAIN, ONE OF THE BIGGEST CULPRITS FOR LIGHT TRESPASS IS CITY, AND IT'S NOT NECESSARILY GARAGES. IT'S STREETLIGHTS, WHICH IS NOT NECESSARILY WHAT YOU GUYS ARE DOING, RIGHT? BUT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE ARE PUSHING FOR, BUT FOR THAT AND JUST -- IT'S REALLY THAT LIGHT TRESPASS -- THE OTHER THING THIS BROUGHT UP FOR ME, AND AS I WAS READING THE STAFF REPORT, I WAS SURPRISED, THERE WAS REFERENCE TO NEON IN THE KIND OF TUNNEL, WHICH I CYCLED THROUGH THERE. I WALK THROUGH ALL THE TIME AND THEN CYCLE ON MY WAY HOME FROM PLANNING COMMISSION EVERY WEEK. I DON'T EVER THINK IT'S TOO DARK. I DON'T KNOW. BUT NEON DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE A REPUTATION OF BEING -- [ OFF-MICROPHONE COMMENT ] -- OKAY. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU MIGHT WANT TO CHANGE THAT.
03:23:24.121: >> THE NAME OF THE FIXTURE MAY HAVE CAUSED SOME CONFUSION.
03:23:30.728: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  OKAY. GREAT. THAT WAS JUST A COMMENT. I IMAGINE THAT IF YOU MET WITH DR. STULTS THAT THINKING ABOUT ENERGY USE ON CITY OPERATIONS IS GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT COMES UP, BUT I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT IS THROUGH HERE AS WELL. THANKS.
03:23:49.046: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN: COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL?
03:23:50.280: >> COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL:  I WOULD LIKE TO CYCLE BACK TO STORMWATER, SO PERHAPS IF YOU COULD STAY UP AT THE PODIUM. IS THE ALLEY PUBLICLY OWNED?
03:24:02.159: >> YES, IT IS.
03:24:11.836: >> COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL: I'M NOT EXPECTING MIRACLES, BUT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE REDESIGN, THERE WAS AN INTERESTING EXPERIMENT ON 4th AVENUE, WHERE THE PAVEMENT HAD CATCH BASINS, AND IT WORKED. IF YOU'RE GETTING DECENT INFILTRATION IN THE ALLEY, YOU'RE VERY LIKELY TO GET DECENT INFILTRATION IN THE ROAD. SO, AGAIN, I'M NOT EXPECTING MIRACLES IN THE CURRENT ITER ITERATION, BUT I WOULD CHALLENGE YOU ALL TO THINK OUTSIDE OF PROPERTY BOUNDARIES, BECAUSE THIS IS ONE OF THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT YOU HAVE THAT A PRIVATE DEVELOPER DOESN'T, AND TO THINK ABOUT WAYS THAT YOU COULD BUILD IN FLEXIBILITY, IN TERMS OF HOW YOUR PIPING WORKS, AS YOU ARE RIPPING THIS THING APART AND STUFF LIKE THAT, TO THINK ABOUT HOW YOU COULD BE CREATIVE WITH REDIRECTING STORMWATER INTO THAT RIGHT-OF-WAY, WHICH I KNOW IS A NO-NO IN TERMS OF PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT, BUT PERHAPS THERE MIGHT BE SOME WILLINGNESS TO EXPERIMENT FROM THE CITY, BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN SOME SUCCESSFUL TRACK RECORDS WITH THAT, AND I JUST REALLY ENCOURAGE YOU AS THE D.D.A. YOU ALL HAVE -- YOU HAVE SOILS LIKE NOBODY ELSE DOES IN THIS TOWN.
03:25:29.413: >> IT'S GREAT DIRT, I AGREE.
03:25:35.952: >> COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL: YOU DID THE WHOLE RESURFACING THING AT KERRY TOWN, AND THAT IS SITTING ON A SAND PILE, AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SO EASY TO ADD SMALL AREAS AROUND THE PAVERS OF THE CATCH BASIN. THEY COULD LITERALLY STICK A HOSE ON THE SAND AND IT WAS INFILTRATING WHEN THEY WERE DOING THE FARMERS MARKET STUDY. SO I WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU BE A LITTLE BIT MORE PROACTIVE ABOUT HOW YOU HANDLE SOME OF THOSE THINGS. I'M GLAD FOR THE GREEN ROOF BUT IT IS PUNY AND I'M GLAD FOR THE ALLEYWAY BUT IT IS SMALL, AND 5% IS TINY. I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU ALL TO THINK ABOUT IN THE FUTURE HOW YOU MIGHT HANDLE AND BE CREATIVE WITH YOUR OPPORTUNITY OF BEING KIND OF A PUBLIC, YOU KNOW, ENTITY.
03:26:19.130: >> I'M ASKING MY COLLEAGUE AMBER TO HELP US.
03:26:25.636: >> HI. SO WE DID TRY TO GET CREATIVE WITH STORMWATER, REDIRECTING THE ANN ASHLEY ROOF WATER, AND WE DIDN'T GET SUPPORT AT THE STAFF LEVEL, AND WE ALSO GOT PUSHBACK AT THE STAFF LEVEL RELATED TO THE FARMERS MARKET LOT. SO WE ARE TRYING. I THINK WHEN WE RESURFACE A ASHLEY, WHEN IT'S FULLY A PUBLIC PROJECT AND WE DON'T HAVE THAT CROSSOVER, IT WILL BE A LITTLE BIT EASIER.
03:26:52.496: >> RIGHT, YEP, YEP. YEAH. AND I GUESS WE ARE ALL JUST GOING TO HAVE TO TRY TO, YOU KNOW, HAVE OUR SUSTAINABILITY STUFF FLOW INTO THAT LEVEL OF STORMWATER WITH STAFF, TOO, BECAUSE I THINK THAT THE DOWNTOWN JUST IS A MASS OF POTENTIAL THAT JUST WE ARE NOT TAPPING AT ALL, THAT I THINK THAT WE SHOULD BE, BECAUSE IT REALLY IS A HUGE OPPORTUNITY THAT WE ARE MISSING AND THAT WE JUST SUFFER WITH OTHER PARTS OF THE CITY IN TERMS OF THE SOILS, AND THIS IS A BIG OPPORTUNITY THERE, SO I ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONTINUE YOUR DIALOGUE WITH STAFF SO THAT WE CAN START TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO REFRAME THINGS A LITTLE BIT, AND AGAIN, FOURTH AVE WORKED, SO IT'S NOT COMPLETELY FOREIGN IN TERMS OF APPROACH, SO THAT'S MY TWO CENTS.
03:27:53.690: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN: COMMISSIONER BRIGGS?
03:27:55.325: >> COMISSIONER BRIGGS:  JUST A FOLLOW-UP ON THAT A LITTLE BIT, BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW THAT WAS A POSSIBILITY AT ALL. SO, COULD YOU EXPOUND A LITTLE BIT ON -- I KNOW THERE'S THE PROJECT THAT'S GOING TO BE COMING UP ON ASHLEY SOON. IS THERE AN OPPORTUNITY HERE? IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE HAS BEEN SOME PUSHBACK FROM THE STAFF LEVEL. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT IS, BUT IS THERE AN OPPORTUNITY TO IN SOME WAYS COUPLE THESE PROJECTS SO THAT STORMWATER IS ADDRESSED?
03:28:28.091: >> I'M GOING TO ASK AMBER TO COME BACK UP TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE SPECIFIC, BUT AS SHE MENTIONED, BY THE STREET PROJECT, IT'S JUST THE STREET PROJECT. BUT I THINK WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE LATITUDE TO WORK WITH STAFF TO ACCOMPLISH GOALS. IT'S THE CROSSOVER BETWEEN THE GARAGE AND THE RADIO RIGHT OF WAY, AND WE ARE NOT SET UP AT THIS POINT FOR A PROJECT THAT IS PUBLICLY OWNED WITH PUBLIC RAINWATER GOING INTO A PUBLIC DRAIN, BECAUSE THE RULES ARE WRITTEN ABOUT HOW PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT CAN'T DO THOSE THINGS, AND THOUGH THE GARAGE IS PUBLICLY OWNED, THERE ISN'T ANY MECHANISM RIGHT NOW IN STAFF FOR THIS TO SORT OF BE ARRANGED.
03:29:12.769: >> YEAH, BUT WHEN WE WORK FULLY WITHIN THE RIGHT-OF-WAY, THERE ARE THOSE MECHANISMS, AND AS YOU REFERENCED FOURTH AVENUE, I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF METHODS TO INCREASE INFILTRATION THAT EVERYONE IS COMFORTABLE WITH AND THAT ARE MAINTAINABLE, BECAUSE THAT IS SOMETHING THAT COMES UP OFTEN, SO ASHLEY STREET IS A VERY COLLABORATIVE PROJECT WITH STAFF. AT THE SYSTEMS PLANNING LEVEL, THEY ARE PLANNING ON PUTTING IN STORM WATER FUNDING AS WELL, SO I DO THINK THAT WE COULD MAKE GOOD PROGRESS ON THAT PROJECT. SO JUST TO FOLLOW UP AND SUPPORT COMMISSIONER MILLS DISCUSSION AROUND LIGHTING, CERTAINLY AS WE HAVE BEEN -- I KNOW YOU HAVE HAD PRESENTATIONS BY SALLY OLE AS WELL, AND THE PARKING STRUCTURE AS IT SITS TODAY IS A LIGHT POLLUTER. IT'S PRETTY CLEAR. IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS, AND THERE'S -- I THINK IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO TAKE EXTRA LENGTHS TO SEE HOW THAT CAN BE MITIGATED IN THE FUTURE SO THAT ESPECIALLY L.E.D. LIGHTS CAN BE -- I MEAN, THERE'S THIS CHALLENGE. YOU WANT PARKING STRUCTURES TO BE BRIGHT AND WELCOMING AND FEEL SAFE, AND YET THAT CAN CONTRIBUTE TO EXCESS LIGHTING, AND LED LIGHTS ARE GREAT, BUT ALSO THE COLOR SPECTRUM OF THEM CAN SOMETIMES BE PROBLEMATIC IN TERMS OF CREATING A VERY BRIGHT LOOK AS WELL.
03:30:38.688: >> I THINK IT'S A CHALLENGE THAT WE'LL CERTAINLY GIVE MORE ATTENTION TO, BECAUSE YOU'RE RIGHT. THE BALANCE, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE ARE DOING IS OPENING IT UP FOR STAIRS AND ELEVATORS AND SECURITY REALLY, SO I THINK IT WILL BE THAT BALANCE THAT WE'LL HAVE TO ACHIEVE, BUT WE WILL TAKE THAT CHALLENGE.
03:30:57.040: >> IS THERE ANYTHING ON -- I AM NOT SURE HOW ON THE ROOFTOP WITH THE SOLAR PANELS AND HOW THAT'S BEING STRUCTURED, BUT IS THERE ANY THOUGHT BEING TAKEN, IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH LIGHT IS ACTUALLY JUST GOING STRAIGHT UP INTO THE NIGHT SKY, IN TERMS OF PREVENTING SOME OF THAT, TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE SHIELDED COMPLETELY DOWN?
03:31:18.728: >> WELL, EVENTUALLY WHEN SOLAR PANELS ARE ON THE ROOF, THE FIXTURES WOULD BE TUCKED IN UNDER THE SOLAR, SO THAT WOULD TAKE CARE OF THAT ISSUE, AT LEAST FROM THAT EXTENT. RIGHT NOW, THOUGH, WE HAVEN'T COMPLETED THE DESIGN OF THE LIGHTING, BUT WHAT TYPICALLY YOU CAN DO IS TO JUST ADD ADDITIONAL POLES. I MEAN, THAT'S REALLY THE -- TO MAKE SHORTER POLES, YOU CAN HAVE A FEW MORE OF THEM, AND THE LIGHT CAN BE CAST DOWN, BUT YOU STILL NEED TO HAVE PRETTY GOOD LIGHTING UP ON THE ROOF.
03:31:55.732: >> AND OUR DRAFT LIGHTING ORDINANCE IS OUT RIGHT NOW FOR REVIEW, SO IF THAT'S SOMETHING -- WHO KNOWS WHERE IT'S GOING, BUT IT WOULD BE A GREAT THING TO TAKE A LOOK AT. AND THEN FINALLY ON THE DESIGN ELEMENT, I KNOW THERE'S MAYBE NOT IT'S CHALLENGING WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT, BUT I HAVEN'T SEEN THIS HAPPEN IN ANN ARBOR, AND ACTUALLY I HAVE ONLY SEEN IT HAPPEN IN SOUTHERN CLIMATES MORE SO -- IS THAT SOMETHING NOT AS FEASIBLE IN A NORTHERN CLIMATE, OR IS THERE A WAY TO CREATE GREEN DESIGN ELEMENTS ON THE OUTSIDE?
03:32:35.271: >> WELL, IT IS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO GROW, PARTICULARLY WITH THE WINTER. WE ARE PROPOSING IVY ON THE NORTHERN PORTION, AND THEN WE ARE GOING TO HAVE PROBABLY ON THE -- WHAT WE ARE -- IF YOU GO SOUTH OF ANN, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE PLANTINGS ALONG THE UPPER LEVEL, PROBABLY THE UPPER LEVEL AND THE LEVEL THAT WILL CASCADE OVER. IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO MAINTAIN, MAINTAIN ANYTHING THAT -- ON A STRUCTURE, BECAUSE IT'S SO EXPOSED TO THE WEATHER.
03:33:09.940: >> RIGHT. SO THERE'S NOT AN OPPORTUNITY TO, ALONG EACH OF THOSE, SORT OF WHATEVER --
03:33:16.713: >> EACH LEVEL?
03:33:18.414: >> YEAH, TO BE ABLE TO BE INTEGRATING SOMETHING IN THERE THAT WOULD BE MUCH MORE ATTRACTIVE TO --
03:33:22.619: >> I THINK WHAT YOU WOULD END UP IS DURING THE WINTER, IT WOULD BE -- AND DURING THE SUMMER, YOU WOULD HAVE TO REPLANT EVERY SUMMER AND -- DEPENDING ON HOW YOU IRRIGATE IT, SO IT WOULD BE QUITE A MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONAL ISSUE, BECAUSE IT'S NOT GOING TO GROW NATURALLY.
03:33:50.814: >> COMISSIONER BRIGGS:  OKAY. THAT'S ALL FOR ME.
03:33:54.350: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN: COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN?
03:33:55.284: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN:  THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR, AND THANK YOU TO COMMISSIONER BRIGGS FOR THE QUESTIONING AROUND THE DARK SKIES. THERE WAS CONVERSATION LAST NIGHT AT THE CITY COUNCIL TABLE ABOUT IT, AND I THINK THERE IS A LOT OF INTEREST IN THE CITY COUNCIL TABLE SEEING THAT MOVE FORWARD, AND PEOPLE ARE EAGER TO SEE THE ORDINANCE. SO AS THIS MOVES FORWARD, WHILE IT'S CERTAINLY NOT LAW TODAY AND WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL UNFOLD IN THE PUBLIC PROCESS TO COME, I THINK IF YOU START TO PLAN AROUND IT, IT WILL GET YOU CLOSER TO THE END TARGET, AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD ENFORCE ON PRIVATE PROPERTY TO ENFORCE ON ZONING CODE.
03:34:53.108: >> JUST A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS. IN REGARDS TO CONSTRUCTION, HOW WILL THE CONSTRUCTION ON -- HOW DO YOU DO CONSTRUCTION? WILL THIS PARKING STRUCTURE REMAIN OPEN? SHUT DOWN?
03:35:06.622: >> THERE WILL BE A MINIMUM. WE HAVE A PHASING PLAN THAT PROVIDES APPROXIMATELY TEN DIFFERENT PHASES. IT WILL BE SAFE. AND ONE OF THE REASONS WE ARE -- THE STRUCTURAL SYSTEM WE ARE USING IS CAST IN PLACE RECONSTRUCTION ON TOP OF THE PRECAST STRUCTURE, AND THE REASON FOR THAT, ONE OF THE PRIMARY REASONS, ONE IS ACCESSIBILITY, BUT WE DO NOT WANT TO LIFT HEAVY PRECAST CONTENTS OVER THE TOP OF AN OPERATING GARAGE. IN FACT, THAT'S VERY INFREQUENTLY THAT IT WOULD HAPPEN AND WE WOULDN'T RECOMMEND IT, SO THAT'S WHY CAST IN PLACE CONSTRUCTION, THERE'S A PHASING PLAN THAT ALLOWS FOR 500 SPACES SAFELY TO BE MAINTAINED, AND WE ALSO HAVE A PLAN AS FAR AS MAINTAINING PEDESTRIAN ACCESS OUTSIDE THE PARKING STRUCTURE WITH COVERED WALKWAYS.
03:36:02.478: >> AND ONE MORE QUESTION SINCE YOU ARE HERE AND I HAVE BEEN ASKED THIS QUESTION VERY FREQUENTLY, WHEN IS ASHLEY AND FIRST GOING TO BECOME TWO WAY?
03:36:10.286: >> THIS IS GREAT. AMBER, CAN I -- WE ARE AIMING TO DO THIS AT THE END OF 2020, OR THEREABOUTS, 2020, SO IT'S COMING UP.
03:36:20.028: >> PERFECT. THANK YOU.
03:36:21.330: >> AND JUST ONE LAST THING ABOUT THE CONSTRUCTION. THIS IS THE GEEKY STUFF. WE DID THIS ALREADY WITH 4th AND WILLIAM. IT'S NOW RECEDED IN DISTANT MEMORY, BUT THE FOURTH AND WILLIAM GARAGE OPERATED WHILE WE ADDED A THIRD FLOOR. THIS IS THE CONSTRUCTION STUFF THAT'S KIND OF FUN.
03:36:45.655: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  ALL OF THOSE IN FAVOR, PLEASE SAY AYE. [ CHORUS OF AYES ] OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. MOVING ON TO MATERIALS RECOVERY FACILITY, THE M.R.F. CITY PROJECT FOR CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL. WE'LL BEGIN WITH A REPORT OR A PRESENTATION FROM THE PETITIONER.
03:37:10.846: >> HI. CHRIS -- I'M WITH THE PUBLIC WORKS UNIT. I'M JOINED BY IBRAHIM AND TIM FROM MANNIK SMITH. I'M GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO THEM TO GO THROUGH THE PROJECT.
03:37:27.430: >> HI. TIM WALTER. I'LL SEE IF I CAN -- DOES THIS JUST SCROLL? ALL RIGHT. IN SHORT, THE PROJECT IS WE ARE REPLACING TWO NEW SCALES AT THE LANDFILL TO REPLACE THE EXISTING SCALE AT THE MRF. THIS IS GOING TO BE A SCALE TO WEIGH IN AND WEIGH OUT. AS A RESULT, THERE IS AN EXISTING TWO-LANE ROAD THERE, AND WE ARE ACTUALLY PUTTING A BYPASS LANE ON EACH SIDE SO THAT WE CAN GET CITY VEHICLES AROUND. THE LOCATION OF THE MRF, I DON'T KNOW IF -- DO WE HAVE ONE -- THERE WE GO, OKAY -- IT'S VERY CIRCUITOUS. YOU COME OFF PLAT, COME IN AROUND THE CORNER, GO TO SCALE, AND AFTER THAT THEY MAY HAVE TO GO TO THE RECYCLING FACILITY OR WHEREVER AND GO BACK IN AGAIN AND COME BACK AND WEIGH OUT. WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE THIS A LOT MORE EFFICIENT, A LOT LESS ENERGY USE FROM THE VEHICLES, BECAUSE THEY CAN GO IN AND GO OUT. WE ARE ALSO AS PART OF THE PROJECT MAKING THE SITE MORE SECURE. WE ARE GOING TO PUT AN AUTOMATIC GATE OR A SLIDE GATE IN THERE THAT WILL BE CLOSED DURING OFF HOURS, OPEN DURING BUSINESS HOURS, AND IT WILL ALSO HAVE ACCESS, CARD ACCESS FOR CITY EMPLOYEES SO THEY CAN GET IN AFTER-HOURS. THERE IS ALSO A LOT OF VEHICLES THAT USE THIS FACILITY THAT ARE REGULATION, I GUESS, IF YOU WANT TO -- REGULARS, I GUESS, IF YOU WANT TO CALL IT, AND THEY ARE GOING TO OPERATE THROUGH AN R.F.I.D. SYSTEM, SO THEY WILL HAVE R.F.I.D. READERS OR CODES IN THE VEHICLES. THEY WILL DRIVE THROUGH. EVERYBODY WILL KNOW WHO THEY ARE, AND IT WILL MAKE THINGS GO QUICKER THAT WAY. THIS WILL ALSO BE USED BY THE CITIZENS, AND THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE A MECHANISM WHERE THEY CAN PULL UP, SCAN, OR SHOW THEIR DRIVER'S LICENSE, SO THAT WE CAN VERIFY THAT THEY ARE AN ANN ARBOR RESIDENT. THEY WILL WEIGH, GO GET AND BE THE DROP-OFF OR PICK UP RECYCLABLES, AND THEN WEIGH ON THE WAY OUT AND IDENTIFY THEMSELVES AGAIN. THERE WILL BE A COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE SCALES. IT GOES ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE WHEELER OR -- YEAH, IT GOES ALL THE WAY BACK TO WHEELER, SO THERE WILL BE MONITORING TO HELP THE CITIZENS. IF THEY ARE NOT SURE, THERE WILL BE AN INTERFACE THERE TO HELP THEM THROUGH THE PROCESS. AND I GUESS THAT'S IT.
03:40:00.379: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  THANK YOU. AND NOW WE'LL HAND IT OVER TO MR. CHENG. WELCOME BACK.
03:40:06.218: >> THANK YOU.
03:40:06.785: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  FOR THE STAFF REPORT.
03:40:09.588: >> YEP. I WOULD ALSO WANT TO INCLUDE THAT THERE IS A NET DECREASE IN IMPERVIOUS SURFACE PROPOSED AS PART OF THIS PROPOSAL. IT HAS BEEN SIGNED OFF BY ALL OF THE STAFF MEMBERS THAT REVIEWED THIS FOR PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT. THE COST IS ABOUT $2.1 MILLION, AND IT'S REQUIRED TO GET PLANNING COMMISSION APPROVAL TO MOVE ON TO CITY COUNCIL, SO SINCE THIS COST IS OVER $250,000. STAFF RECOMMENDS APPROVAL. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, FEEL FREE TO ASK.
03:40:43.989: >> THANK YOU.
03:40:46.425: >> AT THIS TIME I WOULD LIKE TO OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING ON THIS ITEM. IS THERE ANYONE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION? SEEING NO ONE, I WILL CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING, AND I WILL READ THE MOTION. WHEREAS THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR IS DIRECTED TO OBTAIN COMMENTS AND SUGGESTIONS FROM THE APPROPRIATE CITY DEPARTMENTS WITH REGARD TO CERTAIN CITY PROJECTS, MEETING PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS, AND WHEREAS SUCH PROJECTS ARE TO BE REVIEWED BY THE CITY PLANNING COMMISSION PRIOR TO CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL; RESOLVED, THAT THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION FINDS THAT THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR -- MOVED BY COMMISSIONER MILLS, SECOND BY COMMISSIONER WOODS. COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN?
03:41:42.280: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN:  THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR. I'LL JUST OBSERVE WE ARE ALSO TEN MINUTES FROM 11:00 P.M., SO BEFORE WE TAKE UP THE NEXT ITEM, WE MAY NEED TO VOTE FOR HOPEFULLY A SHORT EXTENSION OF THIS MEETING. THE -- AGAIN, YOU KNOW, DIFFERENT HATS, CITY COUNCIL, PLANNING COMMISSION, FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF A PLANNING COMMISSIONER, I THINK THE STAFF REPORT IS ACCURATE. CERTAINLY THERE WILL BE MORE QUESTIONS FROM CITY COUNCIL ABOUT, YOU KNOW, PLANS AT THE MRF, CURRENT STATUS, BUT TONIGHT, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. I APPRECIATE YOUR PATIENCE AND YOUR WORKING ON THIS.
03:42:22.287: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN: COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL?
03:42:24.623: >> COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL: SO I SIT ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION TOO, SO WE HAVE BEEN HEARING A LOT ABOUT THIS FACILITY AND THE KIND OF PLANS AFOOT FOR POTENTIALLY, YOU KNOW, A COUNTY FACILITY, SO I GUESS WHAT I WOULD BE CURIOUS ABOUT IS IF -- AND THESE ARE ALL IFS, SO I UNDERSTAND THAT, YOU KNOW, BUT IF A COUNTY FACILITY ENDS UP BECOMING THE DOMINANT FORCE IN TERMS OF HOW OUR RECYCLING IS HANDLED, IS THIS JUST COMPLETELY POINTLESS IN TERMS OF WHAT GOES ON HERE, OR IS THERE ALWAYS GOING TO BE SOME SORT OF, YOU KNOW, SYSTEM HERE, AND THIS ISN'T -- OVER $2 MILLION, THIS IS GOING INTO SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO LAST FOR FOUR YEARS, AND THEN WE HAVE ANOTHER FACILITY, OR ANOTHER WAY TO THINK ABOUT IT IS IS IF YOU INVEST IN THESE SCALES, ARE THEY SOMETHING THAT IT IS GOING TO BECOME REDUNDANT, THAT THEY COULD BE REUSED SOMEWHERE ELSE, THAT THEY ARE NOT JUST KIND OF NICE AND NEW AND, YOU KNOW, WORKING FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS, AND THEN THEY ARE DEFUNCT BECAUSE WE HAVE A MORE REGIONAL FACILITY THAT COULD BE COMING. AND AGAIN, I REALIZE THAT THESE ARE THEORETICALS.
03:43:36.228: >> NO, I MEAN, THOSE CONVERSATIONS TOOK PLACE IN DEVELOPING THIS PLAN, AND THIS IS REALLY DESIGNED TO HANDLE THE INCREASE IN TRAFFIC FLOW THAT MAY HAPPEN IF WE GO DOWN THAT ROAD. AND REALLY, THE LOCATION IS KIND OF ESSENTIAL TO THAT. BECAUSE IF WE ARE GOING TO DO ANYTHING ON THIS SITE, WE KIND OF NEED THAT CENTRAL PLACE TO GET EVERYONE IN, WEIGHED, AND OUT, SO CERTAINLY IT ACCOMMODATES ANY CHANGE OF FUTURE USE.
03:44:09.861: >> COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL: SO YOU'RE ASSUMING THEN THAT THE COUNTY FACILITY WOULD BE HERE?
03:44:13.298: >> WELL, IF THEY USED A LOCATION ON THIS SITE, THEN THIS WOULD FACILITATE THAT.
03:44:18.436: >> COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL: RIGHT.
03:44:20.204: >> OUR EXISTING SCALE IS AT THE END OF ITS LIFE AT THE MATERIAL RECOVERY FACILITY. IT'S BASICALLY JUST LIMPING ALONG AT THIS POINT. WE HAVE TO PUT A NEW ONE IN. WE ARE REALLY WASTING A LOT WITH THE TRAFFIC -- EVERYONE HAS TO GO TO THE MRF, AND THEN TURN AROUND AND GO TO THEIR RESPECTIVE FACILITY, WHETHER IT'S COMPOST, TRANSFER STATION, BACK TO MRF, INSTEAD OF JUST DRIVE IN, DRIVE OUT WITH KIND OF AN AUTOMATED PROCESS, SO, CERTAINLY, THIS WAS THE BEST ALTERNATIVE, KIND OF WHEN WE WEIGHED, YOU KNOW, DO WE LEAVE IT AT THE MRF, JUST HAVE A SINGLE ONE, OR DO WE KIND OF LOOK TO HOW WE CAN OPTIMIZE THIS SITE. PART OF THE COST IS THAT WE ARE HAVING TO GO -- WE ARE OVER TRASH AT THIS LOCATION, SO THE DESIGN HAS TO ACCOMMODATE POTENTIAL SETTLEMENT, SO THAT ADDS TO IT. THERE REALLY WAS NO OTHER -- BASICALLY, YOU'RE EITHER AT THE MRF, OR YOU'RE AT THE ENTRANCE LOCATION, SO WE CERTAINLY EVALUATED ALL OF THOSE ALTERNATIVES.
03:45:30.041: >> SO YOU NEED TO DO SOMETHING NOW, BASICALLY, BECAUSE YOU'RE SORT OF BANKING ON THE POSSIBILITY THAT IF A FACILITY HAPPENS, IT WILL PROBABLY BE HERE. IT'S WHAT YOU'RE HOPING, IN TERMS OF INVESTMENT, INTO SOMETHING THAT WON'T THEN BE COMPLETELY POINTLESS.
03:45:45.824: >> I THINK ULTIMATELY THERE WILL STILL BE A NEED, WHETHER KIND OF THERE IS A CHANGE WITH THE MRF. YOU KNOW, WE STILL OPERATE THE COM COMPOST. WE STILL OPERATE THE TRANSFER STATION. THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE A NEED FOR A SCALE AT THIS FACILITY. IT'S JUST REALLY MAKING SURE THAT WHAT WE PUT IN NOW COULD BE USED IF WE WENT THE REGIONAL DIRECTION.
03:46:08.380: >> COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL:  I SEE, SO THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE ACTIVITY HERE, EVEN IF SOME OTHER BRAND SPANKIN' NEW REGIONAL FACILITY GETS BUILT SOMEWHERE ELSE, YOU WOULD STILL HAVE THESE FACILITIES HERE IN USE. THAT'S KIND OF WHAT I WAS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND.
03:46:26.230: >> ALSO FROM A PUBLIC WORKS STANDPOINT, RECENTLY WE STARTED MEASURING SALT AND SANDS, THIS WILL HELP US KEEP AN EYE ON WHAT WE ARE USING AS WELL, SO IT PROVIDES OTHER BENEFITS.
03:46:44.682: >> ALL RIGHT. TY. THANKS. I APPRECIATE THAT.
03:46:47.719: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  ALL OF THOSE IN FAVOR, PLEASE SAY AYE. [ CHORUS OF AYES ] OPPOSED? AND CAN I GET A COMMISSIONER TO MOVE AN EXTENSION TO OUR TIME UNTIL 11:20? MOVED BY COMMISSIONER MILLS, SECOND BY COMMISSIONER TRUDEAU. ANY DISCUSSION ON THAT? ALL OF THOSE IN FAVOR, PLEASE SAY AYE. OPPOSED? ALL RIGHT. AND WE ARE EXTENDED UNTIL 11:20. MOVING ON TO THE NEXT ITEM, THANK YOU, MR. CHENG, MASTER PLAN REVIEW, AND WE WILL BEGIN WITH A STAFF REPORT FROM MR. LENART.
03:47:19.884: >> I THINK I CAN USE UP MOST OF THAT 20 MINUTES. SO, THIS IS A FAMILIAR PROCESS THAT THE PLANNING COMMISSION HAS UNDERTAKEN ON AN ANNUAL BASIS WITH A MAYBE UNFAMILIAR CONCLUSION. AS INDICATED IN THE STAFF REPORT, THE SHORT ANSWER IS IT -- STAFF IS RECOMMENDING THAT THE PLANNING COMMISSION RECOMMEND THAT IT IS TIME TO UPDATE THE CITY'S MASTER PLAN. CLIMATE CHANGE IS, WHILE PROBABLY NOT, SADLY, THAT MUCH WORSE THAN IT WAS 30 YEARS AGO, WE ARE CERTAINLY MORE AWARE OF IT, AND IT IS ACCELERATING, AND I THINK OUR PLANNING DOCUMENTS SHOULD REFLECT IT IN A MORE DIRECT AND PERHAPS AGGRESSIVE MANNER. WE, OVER TIME, THE CITY HAS ADOPTED EIGHT MASTER PLANS AND 18 RESOURCE DOCUMENTS. AS WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE, I THINK THIS IS DIFFICULT FOR YOU AS POLICY MAKERS AND DECISION MAKERS AND THE PUBLIC AND PROPERTY OWNERS TO UNDERSTAND ALL OF THE MYRIAD OF POLICIES AND GOALS IN ALL OF THOSE DOCUMENTS, AND I THINK IT'S WORTHWHILE TO TAKE A CRACK AT CONSOLIDATING THEM. AFFORDABILITY IS BECOMING A MORE ACUTE CHALLENGE FOR THE CITY. IF WE DON'T FIND OPPORTUNITIES TO ESTABLISH LAND USE POLICIES RESPONSIVE TO THAT, IT'S GOING TO ULTIMATELY START TO COMPROMISE OUR ECONOMIC VITALITY. LET ALONE ACCESSIBILITY. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT ALL OF YOU -- WHILE I'M NOT, ALL OF YOU ARE GETTING OLDER. IT'S PREDICTED BY 2025, THE NUMBER OF SENIORS IN THE STATE OF MICHIGAN IS GOING TO OUTNUMBER THE NUMBER OF CH CHILDREN. WE NEED TO HAVE A COMMUNITY THAT RESPONDS TO THAT AS IT RELATES TO ACTIVITY DRIVING ALTERNATIVES, AS THE AVERAGE ADULT IS NOW FACING SEVERAL YEARS OF THEIR LIFE WHERE THEY ARE UNABLE TO DRIVE, AND OF COURSE, THE UNNECESSARY HOUSING STOCK, AND A COUPLE OF OTHER STATISTICS. OUR POPULATION IS PROJECTED RIGHT NOW TO BE THE HIGHEST IN ITS HISTORY. HOWEVER, THE MAJORITY OF OUR VACANT LAND HAS NOW BEEN DEVELOPED, THAT THOSE TRENDS ARE GOING TO EXACERBATE LAND USE EFFICIENCIES AND CONFLICTS, AND I THINK OUR MASTER PLAN NEEDS TO ADDRESS THAT, AND FINALLY THE NUMBER OF JOBS IN THE CITY HAS DRASTICALLY INCREASED, AND JUST ONE SNAPSHOT FROM SEMCOG FROM 2010-2013 DOCUMENTS THAT EVERY DAY OVER THAT PERIOD OF TIME, WE HAD MORE THAN FOUR NEW COMMUTERS COME INTO THE CITY, EVERY SINGLE DAY OVER THAT THREE-YEAR PERIOD, IS THAT IS GOING TO HAVE -- THE LAND USE DECISIONS ARTICULATED IN OUR MASTER PLAN ARE OBVIOUSLY GOING TO IMPACT THAT IN BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE WAYS, DEPENDING ON THE DECISIONS THAT WE MAKE. SO BASED ON ALL OF THOSE REASONS, I HAVE PUT FORTH TWO RESOLUTIONS FOR YOU. ONE IS RELATED TO THE MASTER PLAN, AND ONE IS TO THE RESOURCE DOCUMENTS. BOTH OF THEM ADOPT THE FOLLOWING DOCUMENTS TODAY, AS STILL ARE POLICY DOCUMENTS -- AND COMMITS TO YOUR LEADERSHIP AS THE PLANNING COMMISSION TO UNDERTAKE THIS PROCESS, AND THAT YOU RECOMMEND THE ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES TO SOLICIT BOTH CONSULTANT ASSISTANTS -- AND THAT THIS RESOLUTION WOULD BE THE MOST RECENT ITERATION OF YOUR REVIEW OF THESE DOCUMENTS.
03:51:08.546: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  THANK YOU. I WILL NOW OPEN IT UP FOR PUBLIC HEARING. IS THERE ANYBODY IN THE AUDIENCE WHO WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION IN REGARDS TO THIS AGENDA ITEM? SO, PLEASE STEP UP TO THE PODIUM, STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS FOR THE RECORD, AND YOU'LL HAVE UP TO THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
03:51:27.698: >> THANK YOU. KEN CARVER. 2387 HILLDALE. IT'S NICE TO BE BOTH THE FIRST AND THE LAST SPEAKER TONIGHT. AND, AS ALWAYS, I'M VERY IMPRESSED WITH YOUR SMARTNESS AND THE INCISIVENESS OF YOUR ANALYSIS AND COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS. IT'S LIKE A WHOLE SEMINAR ON PLANNING FOR ME. I'M ALSO IMPRESSED WITH YOUR STAMINA. I DON'T THINK I HAVE EVER BEEN TO ONE OF THESE PLANNING COMMISSION MEETINGS THAT'S GONE LESS THAN FOUR HOURS. SO, I'LL BE VERY BRIEF. I AM HERE REPRESENTING THE HURON HIGHLANDS NEIGHBORHOOD. WE GOT A LETTER STATING THAT AS PART OF ITS ANNUAL REVIEW, THE PLANNING COMMISSION IS SEEKING COMMENTS ABOUT THE CITY MASTER PLAN, INCLUDING ELEMENTS THAT SHOULD BE STUDIED FOR POSSIBLE CHANGE. AND WE FEEL THAT A PORTION OF THE LAND USE ELEMENT OF THE MASTER PLAN, WHICH WAS ADOPTED IN 2009, FOR THE 32 ACRES JUST TO THE NORTH OF OUR NEIGHBORHOOD, THE SO-CALLED BARTON GREEN PARCEL, SHOULD BE STAYEDED FOR POSSIBLE CHANGE, AND WE HAVE SOME SUGGESTIONS FOR THOSE CHANGES, WHICH ARE IN YOUR PACKET, SO I WON'T GO OVER THOSE AGAIN. AND, KNOWING THAT YOU'RE NOW GOING TO BE GEARING UP FOR A COMPLETE UPDATE OF THE MASTER PLAN, I CAN ANTICIPATE THAT IT MAY NOT BE APPROPRIATE FOR YOU TO LOOK AT SITE SPECIFIC CHANGES RIGHT NOW, LIKE THIS ONE. YOU MAY WANT TO WAIT UNTIL T THE -- YOU UNDERTAKE THE FULL MASTER PLAN UPDATE. I CAN ALSO UPDATE -- ANTICIPATE A POSSIBLE SECOND REASON YOU MAY WANT TO JUST LET THIS ONE GO. MOST OF YOU KNOW THAT THIS S SITE -- THE CITY IS BEING SUED RIGHT NOW OVER THIS SITE, AND FROM A LEGAL POINT OF VIEW, I KNOW THAT THE CITY'S INTEREST, WHICH YOU REPRESENT, DO NOT -- ARE NOT EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE NEIGHBORHOOD'S INTERESTS. WE ARE NOT PARTY TO THE SUIT, BUT IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THE CITY'S ATTORNEYS MIGHT BE UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT EVEN TOUCHING THIS KIND OF RADIOACTIVE SITE AT THIS TIME IN ANY WAY. THAT BEING SAID, WE DON'T THINK THIS HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE LAWSUIT OR THE PREVIOUS SITE PLAN. WE ARE THINKING ABOUT THIS IN TERMS OF SOME FUTURE NEW DEVELOPMENT, AND WE WANT -- WE THINK THAT BY TWEAKING THESE FEW WORDS THAT WE CAN BETTER GUIDE WHATEVER COMES NEXT ON THIS SITE. BUT, AGAIN, THIS MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT YOU'LL WANT TO POSTPONE FOR STRATEGIC OR LEGAL REASONS, BUT WE WANTED TO BE ON THE RECORD FOR SOME CHANGES THAT WE THINK WOULD BE HELPFUL, NOT JUST FOR US, BUT FOR EVERYONE, AND SO THANK YOU FOR CONSIDERING THOSE.
03:54:27.077: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO WISHES IT ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION IN REGARDS TO THIS ITEM? SEEING NO ONE, I WILL CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING, AND I WILL READ THE MOTION. RESOLVED, THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION HEREBY APPROVES THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR MASTER PLAN RESOLUTION AND THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR RESOURCE AND INFORMATION IN SUPPORT OF THE MASTER PLAN RESOLUTION. MOVED BY COMMISSIONER MILLS, SECOND BY COMMISSIONER WEATHERBEE. WE ARE IN DISCUSSION. COMMISSIONER MILLS?
03:55:00.043: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  THANK YOU, MR. GARBER, FOR STICKING AROUND AND ALSO FOR SUBMITTING THE COMMENTS THAT ARE IN OUR PACKETS. I THINK THAT YOU'RE RIGHT THAT DOING ANY KIND OF EDITING RIGHT NOW ON THE SPOT IS INAPPROPRIATE. I THINK, THOUGH, WHAT YOU BROUGHT UP IS REALLY HELPFUL, THAT WE ARE GOING TO NEED TO THINK THROUGH AS WE DO THE MASTER PLAN REWRITE, BECAUSE THIS COMES UP CONTINUOUSLY, ARE OUR SPECIFIC SITE PLAN RECOMMENDATIONS. AND SO THIS WAS THE FIRST COMMENT ABOUT LIKE CHANGING THE ACREAGE, RIGHT. HALF OF IT HAS ALREADY BEEN DEVELOPED, SO LET'S CONSIDER THAT THAT'S STILL -- THAT THAT RECOMMENDATION STILL HOLDS FOR THE 32 ACRES. THE SECOND PART IS WHAT WE DO ABOUT INTERCONNECTIVITY AND SUBSTREETS. THIS COMES UP EVERY SINGLE TIME WE HAVE SOME KIND OF DEVELOPMENT, AND, AGAIN, I AM NOT SURE HOW MANY SITES ARE LEFT WHERE, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE AS T THE -- AS YOU RIGHTLY NOTED, MR. LENART, WE DON'T HAVE TONS OF GREEN FIELDS LEFT, BUT FOR THOSE THAT ARE, I THINK IT WOULD BE EXTREMELY HELPFUL FOR THE PLANNING CONSULTANT THAT WE HIRE TO TELL US HOW OTHER PLACES ARE DOING THIS, AND WHETHER IT SHOULD BE REALLY FOCUSED ON NONMOTORIZED CONNECTIVITY, WHICH I THINK IS GENERALLY NOT CONTROVERSIAL, OR IF WE ALSO SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT ALL MODES, CONNECTING ALL MODES, BECAUSE THAT'S SOMETHING THAT CONTINUOUSLY COMES UP. SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS UP, AND I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT NOT JUST FOR THIS PARTICULAR SITE, BUT THROUGH ALL OF THE SITES IN THE MASTER PLAN, AND I HOPE THAT WE TAKE THAT UP IN THE MASTER PLANNING EFFORT. OTHERWISE, I'M -- EVERYTHING THAT YOU SAID IS RIGHT ON. I THINK THAT THIS IS -- THIS IS GREAT, THAT WE ARE USING THIS KIND OF SET OF FACTS FOR MOVING FORWARD AS WE RETHINK THE MASTER PLAN AND HOPEFULLY CONSOLIDATING IT SO THAT IT'S NOT -- WELL, I SHOULD LOOK THROUGH THE THING ABOUT HOW MANY DOCUMENTS IT IS.
03:57:15.378: >> 26.
03:57:15.746: >> 26 DOCUMENTS, THANK YOU.
03:57:19.983: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN: COMMISSIONER TRUDEAU?
03:57:21.151: >> JUST ALONG THE SAME LINES, I THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGES IN RELYING ON OUR CURRENT LAND USE ELEMENT OF OUR MASTER PLAN IS THAT IT GETS EXTREMELY SPECIFIC IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES IN WAYS THAT ISN'T PARTICULARLY HELPFUL. IT SETS UP EXPECTATIONS THAT WE CAN'T PRACTICALLY MEET, AND IN MY OPINION IT TRIES TO TAKE ON MORE THAN WHAT THE PLAN SHOULD BE DOING FOR US, WHICH IS SORT OF ARTICULATING GOALS AND ARTICULATING VALUES AND HOW WE SHOULD BE MAKING POLICY DECISIONS, SO IN A LOT OF WAYS, THESE THINGS ARE WAY TOO SPECIFIC, AND THEN PEOPLE EXPECT A SPECK THING TO HAPPEN, AND THAT ISN'T REALLY THE ROLE OF THE PLAN, SO I HOPE GOING FORWARD THROUGH THIS PROCESS WE CAN GET SOMETHING THAT DOES A BETTER JOB OF THAT, AND ALSO, I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH THE ARGUMENT LAID OUT. I'M GLAD NOW IS THE TIME THAT THIS IS HAPPENING. I'M SAD I WON'T BE ON THE PLANNING COMMISSION TO JOIN YOU ALL. BUT, YEAH, I'M TOTALLY HAPPY TO SEE THIS MOVING FORWARD.
03:58:30.621: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  ALL RIGHT, SEEING NO OTHER COMMENTS, ARE WE READY FOR A VOTE? ALL RIGHT. ALL OF THOSE IN FAVOR, PLEASE SAY AYE. OPPOSED? MOVING ON TO AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION. IF THERE IS ANYONE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION IN REGARDS TO ANY ITEM, YOU MAY STEP UP TO THE PODIUM AND ADDRESS UP FOR UP TO THREE MINUTES. SEEING NO ONE RUNNING UP TO THE PODIUM, I'LL MOVE ON TO COMMISSION PROPOSED BUSINESS. COMMISSIONER MILLS?
03:59:01.584: >> VICE CHAIR MILLS:  I'M NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT SIGNS, BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S KIND OF EMBEDDED IN THE POSTPONEMENT, I THINK IT WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL AT A FUTURE WORK SESSION, MR. LENART, IF YOU COULD TALK US THROUGH WHEN STAFF REPORTS ARE AVAILABLE, BECAUSE THAT'S COME UP A COUPLE OF TIMES NOW, AND I THINK IT WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL FOR US TO UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS, AND, YOU KNOW, WHEN THAT HAPPENS. THANK YOU.
03:59:28.812: >> CHAIR MILSHTEYN:  ANY OTHER -- COMMISSIONER WOODS?
03:59:29.913: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS:  I TOO AM NOT ACTUALLY GOING TO PROPOSE ANYTHING, BUT I'M JUST GOING TO USE THESE MOMENTS FOR A COMMENT, REALIZING THAT IT IS LATE AT NIGHT, BUT I TOO, ALONG WITH OTHERS IN THE COMMUNITY, I WAS EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE VOTE THAT WAS TAKEN REGARDING THE TWO COMMISSIONERS WHO WILL NO LONGER BE HERE WITH US. I THINK IT SENDS A BAD TASTE TO THE COMMUNITY. IT IS OFTEN DIFFICULT TO FIND FOLKS WHO ARE WILLING TO PUT IN THE KIND OF TIME AND ENERGY THAT IT TAKES TO DO A GOOD JOB IN A COMMISSION LIKE THIS, BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO REALIZE THAT IT IS PURELY VOLUNTEER, AND PEOPLE ARE DOING THIS OUT OF THEIR LOVE FOR THE COMMUNITY, AND THERE IS NO COMPENSATION, INDEED
