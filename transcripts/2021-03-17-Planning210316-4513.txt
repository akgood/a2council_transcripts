WE DID MOVE THE MEETINGS, FROM THE SECOND THURSDAY OF THE MONTH TO THE FIRST THURSDAY OF THE MONTH, AT 7:00 P.M.  SO, I WILL PROVIDE MORE UPDATES AS NEEDED!
00:07:04.558: >> VERY GOOD. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMITTEE LIAISONS? HAVE ANYTHING TO REPORT? OKAY. VERY GOOD. WE'RE ON ITEM NO. 7, THEN, WHICH IS PUBLIC COMMENT. THIS, IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PERSONS TO SPEAK FOR UP TO THREE MINUTES ABOUT AN ISSUE THAT IS NOT LISTED AS A PUBLIC HEARING ON THIS AGENDA. WE HAVE ONE PUBLIC HEARING ON THE AGENDA, AND THAT IS THE ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS. SO IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A COMMENT, ON ANY OTHER MATTER, PLEASE CALL 877-853-5247. AND ENTER MEETING I.D. 990-9896-8122. CITY STAFF WILL SELECT CALLERS THAT HAVE RAISED THEIR HANDS, CALLING ON YOU BY THE LAST THREE DIGITS OF YOUR TELEPHONE NUMBER TO DIGITALLY RAISE YOUR HAND PRESS STAR 9 ON YOUR TELEPHONE. YOU'LL HEAR AN AUTOMATED ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE HOST IS ALLOWING YOU TO SPEAK AND THEN YOU'LL NEED TO UNMUTE YOUR PHONE AND YOU DO THAT BY PRESSING STAR 6.

AGAIN, IF YOU'RE ON THE LINE, AND WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION DURING THIS PUBLIC COMMENT OPPORTUNITY, ABOUT ANYTHING OTHER THAN ADUS, THE ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS, THE -- YOU PRESS STAR 9 ON YOUR PHONE, TO RAISE YOUR HAND. (PAUSE),
00:08:44.657: >> CALLER PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 534. CALLER WITH PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 534. YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION
00:08:55.836: >> CALLER:  GOOD EVENING. THIS IS TOM CALLING FROM LOWER TOWN, I HAD AN INTERACTION ON SOCIAL MEDIA, THIS PAST WEEK, WHERE A GENTLEMAN INSISTED THAT I WAS -- AGAINST EVERYTHING. AND THAT REALLY MADE ME THINK ABOUT HOW MAYBE I PRESENT MYSELF BECAUSE I'M FOR SO MUCH, AND REALLY, AGAINST VERY LITTLE. AND IF ANYBODY -- I DON'T THINK HE WATCHES THE MEETINGS, BY THE WAY, JUST MAYBE I DEVELOPED A REPUTATION, BUT, IN MY MIND MY REPUTATION IS BEING FOR THINGS SO I'VE BEEN FOR, FOR A LONG TIME, AND, PUBLICLY STATED, PLANNING COMMISSION MEETINGS EVEN, BEFORE MOST OF YOU WERE ON PLANNING COMMISSION, PUBLIC HEARINGS, TRANSIT QUARTER ZONING, THE CONCEPT IS SOMETHING I'VE BEEN FOR AND ADVOCATING FOR A LONG TIME. I'M VERY MUCH IN FAVOR OF THE PLANNED PROJECT REPLACEMENT THAT YOU'RE DOING. I'VE ADVOCATED FOR THAT FOR A LONG TIME AND I'M VERY PLEASED TO SPECIFICALLY WITH -- WITH THAT ONE, BECAUSE IT BAKES RIGHT IN THERE, DIRECTLY ADDRESSING OUR SUSTAINABILITY AND AFFORDABILITY GOALS. AND SOME OF OUR OTHER THINGS TEND TO DO IT INDIRECTLY. I LIKE IT WHEN IT'S DONE DIRECTLY. WHETHER THAT'S A PREMIUM, OR HOW THE PLANNED PROJECT MODIFICATION IS GOING. SOME OF THE BEST PRACTICES FROM OTHER COMMUNITIES AND ADUS, INVOLVE DIRECTLY, ADDRESSING AFFORDABLE HOUSING, NOT INDIRECTLY, BUT DIRECTLY. SAME WITH SUSTAINABILITY MEASURES. SO I MAY BE A STICKLER FOR PROCESS. I DON'T MIND ADMITTING TO THAT. I THINK WE SHOULD BE DOING A MASTER PLAN BEFORE DOING ALL THE SWEEPING CHANGES THAT WE'RE DOING NOW. I THINK WE END UP WITH A BETTER SOLUTION, IF WE GO THROUGH THE PROCESS THE WAY THE -- IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE DONE, WHEN YOU MAKE THESE BIG OF A CHANGES, IT REALLY DOES CALL FOR THE MASTER PLAN TO BE REVISED. AND I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE, IN TRANSIT CORRIDORS, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT, SHOULD WE DO ALL OR PART OF THE CORRIDORS, BY THE WAY, ALEXIS DID A GREAT JOB THE PRESENTATION SHE GAVE AND THE MATERIALS SHE PUT TOGETHER. BUT SHOULD WE DO ALL OR SOME OF THE CORRIDORS, OR PART OF A CORRIDOR, OR THE FULL CORRIDOR, MASS ZONE THEM OR DO THEM ONE AT A TIME. MY PERSONAL OPINION IF WE DID A MASTER PLAN REVISION TAKE ONE MAYBE THE SOUTH STATE STREET AREA FIRST AND DO THAT. STAFF, LED NOT EVEN PAY A CONSULTANT THAT WE WOULD GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS AND SHAKE OUT THE RIGHT WAY OF DOING. THE NATURE OF GOING THROUGH A PROCESS OFTEN SHAKES OUT. WHAT THE OBVIOUS RIGHT SOLUTION WOULD BE, AND IN THAT CASE, IT WOULD
00:11:28.421: >> 30 MORE SECONDS!
00:11:30.423: >> TOM:  IN A MASS WAY, FOR SECTIONS OF A CORRIDOR, IDENTIFY ON A MAP, WHERE WE WANT THOSE CHANGES TO BE. THAT'S PART OF A MASTER PLAN PROCESS, AND THEN THOSE -- WHEN SOMEBODY INDIVIDUALLY ASKS FOR REZONING, THEY'VE ALREADY BEEN IDENTIFIED. THEY WOULD, THEN, MEET THE NEW MASTER PLAN, SO IT SOLVES ITSELF IF WE FOLLOW THE PROCESS, THAT'S WHY I'M A STICKLER FOR THE PROCESS, BECAUSE WE GET BETTER OUTCOMES. THANK YOU.
00:11:58.051: >> CHAIR:  THANK YOU, ANYONE ELSE ON THE LINE WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS, THE PLANNING COMMISSION DURING THIS OPPORTUNITY FOR PUBLIC COMMENT, PLEASE, PRESS STAR 9 TO DIGITALLY RAISE YOUR HAND. (A PAUSE),
00:12:12.265: >> CALLER WITH PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 556. CALLER WITH PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 556. YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION,
00:12:22.308: >> THIS IS RALPH M. CAN YOU HEAR OKAY?
00:12:26.279: >> WE CAN!
00:12:27.113: >> RALPH:  I GUESS I JUST WANT TO MAKE A GENERAL COMMENT ABOUT LOOKING AT BIG-PICTURE, AND LOOKING AT ON NUMEROUS VIEWPOINTS ON ANY TOPIC. WHETHER THAT'S ADUS, TRANSIT ORIENTED ZONING OR ANY OF THE OTHER BIG-PICTURE ITEMS THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT NOW, WHICH -- OF WHICH THERE ARE MANY. AND I -- I READ, WITH SOME INTEREST THE -- A LOT OF THE MATERIALS THAT WERE POSTED TONIGHT WITH REGARD TO ADU AND WHILE I'M NOT FOCUSING ON THOSE SPECIFICALLY, I THINK THEY ILLUSTRATE SOMETHING THAT WE OUGHT TO DO HERE. AND THAT IS, AGAIN, LOOKING AT ALL SIDES OF IT. I THINK IT'S WORTH NOTING, THAT IN THOSE -- IN THOSE PIECES, AND ALSO, IN SEVERAL OTHER PIECES, THAT I'VE SEEN, A COUPLE OF WHICH, I'VE FORWARDED PIECES OF TO YOU, IN PRIOR E-MAILS, THERE ARE -- IN ALL OF THESE OTHER PLACES, THAT WE'RE COMPARING OR LOOKING AT. THERE ARE OTHER PROGRAMS, WHICH ARE TIED IN TO WHATEVER THE ZONING CHANGES ARE. AND, IN PORTLAND OR IN SEATTLE, THERE ARE PROGRAMS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO HELP HOMEOWNERS GET LOANS, SO THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO SELL THE PROPERTY TO AN INVESTOR. THERE ARE -- IN ALL OF THE CALIFORNIA CITIES, THERE ARE INCLUSIONARY ZONING POLICIES, OR SOME ATTEMPTS TO FACILITATE THAT TYPE OF ABILITY TO GET LOWER-INCOME PEOPLE INTO HOUSING. ARE ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS, IN EVERY SINGLE CITY, THERE ARE THOSE TYPES OF PROGRAMS, WHICH ARE BEING WORKED ON, HEAVILY, WITH THE ZONING CHANGES, AND I THINK WE REALLY NEED TO THINK ABOUT THAT, BECAUSE I DON'T SEE ANY OF THAT GOING ON HERE. THERE MAY BE A LOT OF, YOU KNOW, IN ALL OF YOUR COLLECTIVE HEADS, YOU KNOW, THINKING ABOUT THOSE THINGS, BUT WE'RE NOT DOING THEM. AND I THINK, EVERY URBAN PLANNER, THAT I'VE ENGAGED WITH, ON THIS TOPIC, HAS INDICATED THAT THE ZONING CHANGES, ARE NOT GOING TO GET AFFORDABILITY DONE BY THEMSELVES. JUST NOT -- THAT -- AS PATRICK, OF VANCOUVER, URBAN PLANNER -- AT THE UNIVERSITY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA STATED:  THE FREE MARKET IS NOT GOING TO GET IT DONE. AND WE -- WE NEED TO REALLY THINK ABOUT THE BAKING-IN CONCEPT OR SOME OTHER WAY,
00:14:57.463: >> 30 MORE SECONDS.
00:14:58.097: >> RALPH:  TO GET OTHER PROGRAMS, (CONTINUING), WHICH WORK HAND IN HAND, RATHER THAN JUST CONCENTRATING, SOLELY ON THE ZONING CHANGES. THANK YOU,
00:15:12.312: >> SARAH MILLS, CHAIR:  IF ANYONE ELSE WISHS TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION ON A -- ON ANYTHING OTHER THAN ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS? YOU CAN PRESS STAR 9, NOW, TO RAISE YOUR HAND. (A PAUSE),
00:15:28.728: >> ALL RIGHT.
00:15:29.229: >> THAT'S IT.
00:15:29.929: >> WE WILL MOVE ON, THEN, TO THE NEXT ITEM ON OUR AGENDA: WHICH IS, NO. 8, THE PUBLIC HEARINGS FOR THE NEXT BUSINESS MEETING.
00:15:39.672: >>, YES, WE'VE GOT FOUR NEW PUBLIC HEARINGS SCHEDULED FOR THE APRIL 6TH PLANNING COMMISSION MEETING. ONE IS AN ADDITION TO AN EXISTING BUILDING FOR CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL. CENTRAL PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT INCORPORATED IS PROPOSING A 300 SQUARE FOOT ELEVATED ADDITION AT THE REAR OF AN EXISTING BUILDING, IN A NONRESIDENTIAL ZONE DISTRICT. PROPOSED ADDITION INCLUDES A DECK AND COVERS A PORTION OF THE SURFACE PARKING SPACES ON A.1 ACRE SITE. THIS IS A -- YOU DON'T SEE, TOO MANY, SINGLE-FAMILY SITE PLANS, THIS IS BECAUSE IT'S NOT IN A RESIDENTIALLY-ZONED DISTRICT AS PER OUR UDC. A SECOND PUBLIC HEARING, EXTRAORDINARY INDIVIDUALS CHILDCARE CENTER SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE FOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION APPROVAL, REQUEST FOR SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE OF APPROVAL FOR A CHILDCARE CENTER IN THE NEW GRACE APOSTOLIC CHURCH LOCATED AT 2898 PACKARD ROAD ZONED R1C, A THIRD PUBLIC HEARING IS AMENDMENT TO CHAPTER 55 UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE TO CREATE A NEW ZONING DISTRICT FOR TRANSIT CORRIDORS FOR CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL. THIS IS THE PROPOSED ZONING, TRANSIT ZONING DISTRICT CREATION, IT IS NOT ASSIGNING THAT DISTRICT TO ANY GEOGRAPHIES AT THIS TIME. AND THE 4TH PUBLIC HEARING IS PROPOSED AMENDMENT AS I REFERENCED, AT THE BEGINNING FOR THE ORC DISCUSSION PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO MODIFY HOME OCCUPATION REGULATIONS SECTION 5.60.6H OF CHAPTER 55 OF THE UNIFIED [AWAY FROM MICROPHONE] >> VERY GOOD, THANK YOU, WE ARE ON ITEM 9, THEN, UNFINISHED BUSINESS: THIS, IS THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS, REGARDING ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS WITHIN CHAPTER 55. WEB /* WELCOME
00:17:26.746: >> THANK YOU, I HOPE EVERYBODY'S HAVING A GOOD EVENING. I DO HAVE THE POWERPOINT PRESENTATION FROM THE MARCH 2ND AND I'M HAPPY TO GO OVER IT AGAIN, IF MEMBERS FIND THAT'S GOING TO BE HELPFUL BUT I'M NOT PLANNING ON REHASHING THAT BUT WE DO HAVE IT IF YOU WANT TO REFERENCE ANY OF THE PREVIOUS SLIDES OR SOME OF THE LANGUAGE, I WAS HOPING TO ANSWER, AT LEAST GIVE OUT STATISTICS AND DATA AND RESPOND TO A LOT OF THE CONCERNS, I THINK, THAT CAME UP FROM THE PREVIOUS MEETING. T'S SEE. I'VE GOT A WHOLE LIST OF THEM HERE, SO LET'S G THROUGH.... I'M GOG TO.. ALL RIGHT, C EVEBODY SEE UP. THIS AND I GUESS I'LL HE TO SOLL DO A LITTLE BIT. ONE  THE ITEMS THAT CAME , AT T PREVIOUS SFF MEING, WA THE SEACKS FORHE PROPOS ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS, THIS IS A TICAL PICTURE, I'M GOG TO JUS GOING TO U TH, TYPILLY HA A FRONT SETBACK, TWO SIDE SETBACKS AND A REAR SETBACK. TYPICALLY, THE ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT OR ACCESSORY STRUCTURE, IS REQUIRED TO BE A MINIMUM OF THREE FEET, FROM THE SIDE AND THE REAR PROPERTY LINE. AS YOU CAN SEE HERE IF YOU WERE TO ATTACH, TO THE PRINCIPAL STRUCTURE IT WOULD HAVE TO BE IN THIS WHITE AREA THAT'S, WHAT WE CALL, THE BUILDING ENVELOPE. SO IT WOULD HAVE TO BE BUILT IN THERE, FOR IN THIS CASE, I THINK WE'RE FOCUSING ON DETACHED ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS, WHICH WOULD HAVE TO BE THREE FEET FROM THE SIDE AND REAR AND CANNOT TAKE UP MORE THAN 35% OF THIS YEAR YARD AREA JUST FOR DISCUSSION AS WE GO ON THROUGH THE MEETING IF WE WOULD LIKE TO CHANGE, YOU KNOW, THE -- THE MINIMUM SET BACKS TO 5 FEET FOR THAT ACCESSORY STRUCTURE I THINK THAT'S A GREAT CONVERSATION. IT PROBABLY IS JUST FOR REFERENCE, ONCE AGAIN, THIS IS IN BAD PLACE, WHAT ABOUT FOR A SIDE -- I'M SORRY CORNER LOT, AGAIN, YOU HAVE TWO FRONTAGES IN THIS CASE YOU'VE GOT THE SIDE. THEN YOU HAVE THE REAR, WHICH THE ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT WOULD GO BEHIND THE FRONT SET BACK INTO THE REAR YARD NOT TAKING UP MORE THAN 35%. WE CAN USE THAT AS A REFERENCE FOR ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS FOR FURTHER SETBACK. ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT LOCATIONS, LET'S SEE. ALSO GOING TO -- LET'S SEE WHAT ELSE DO I HAVE? LET'S GET INTO, I BELIEVE SOME QUESTIONS CAME UP, REGARDING, RENTING. THE ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT, I'M JUST GOING TO BRIEFLY READ SOME OF THE SECTION, MAYBE NOT THE WHOLE SECTION, THIS WAS IN THE STAFF REPORT. THAT CAME UP WITH HOW THESE ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS ARE TAXED. THIS INFORMATION IS FROM THE CITY ASSESSOR'S OFFICE, DO YOU DO ASSESSMENT PROPERTY OWNERS WITH ONE UNIT PRAERPTS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR 100% PRINCIPAL RESIDENTIAL EXEMPTION, THAT'S THE PRE, IF THEY OCCUPY AT LEAST 50% OF THE HOME AS PRINCIPAL RESIDENCE. I THINK THIS CAME UP FROM ONE OF THE COMMISSIONERS THAT WAS, INQUIRING ABOUT WHAT IF SOMEBODY LIVES IN THEIR HOME AND RENTING OUT TO A COUPLE OF PEOPLE? SO ASSUMING THEY'RE TAKING UP MORE THAN 50% OOF THE HOME THEY STILL GET 100% PRE. AGAIN, IF THEY OCCUPY LESS THAN THAT THEY WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE PERCENTAGE THEY OCCUPY. WHEN THERE ARE MULTIPLE UNITS ON A PROPERTY INCLUDING AN DO YOU DO, THE PROPERTY IS NO LONGER ELIGIBLE FOR 100PRE, TRUE WHETHER THIS IS RENTED OR NOT. I THINK THIS CAME UP AT THE LAST MEETING WHAT HAPPENS IF SOMEBODY IS STAYING THERE FOR FREE, A FAMILY MEMBER, JUST LETTING SOMEBODY STAY THERE. THEY COULD BE COMPLETELY VACANT REPRESENTED FOR FREE OR USED BY THE HOMEOWNER FOR ANOTHER PURPOSE AND AS LONG AS THERE ARE SEPARATE UNITS OF THE PROPERTY THE PROPERTY IS ONLY ELIGIBLE FOR A PARTIAL PRE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE VALUE OF THE UNIT OCCUPIED BY THE PRINCIPAL RESIDENTS. THE NEXT SECTION IS -- THIS IS WAT THE ASSESSOR'S OFFICE IS GOING TO ASK YOU TO ATTEST TO. BUT I'LL JUST CONCLUDE THAT THE OVERALL ASSESSMENT, IS A COMPILATION OF THE VALUE OF THE LAND, AND ALL OF THE PHYSICAL COMPONENTS OF A PROPERTY, IF THERE'S A DETACHED ADU ON A PROPERTY, THE VALUE FOR THAT SEPARATE BUILDING OR PORTION OF BUILDING IS SUBTRACTED FROM THE OVERALL VALUE OF ALL THE PROPERTY'S PHYSICAL IMPROVEMENTS, IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE VALUE OF PROPERTY IMPROVEMENTS THAT ARE ELIGIBLE FOR A PRE. THAT DETERMINED PERCENTAGE, IS APPLICABLE TO THIS PRINCIPAL RESIDENCE IS THE OVERALL PORTION ELIGIBLE FOR A PRE, I KNOW IT'S A LOT TO SIFT THROUGH. BUT I DO KNOW IF THERE ARE DISGREEMENTS OR RESIDENTS WANT TO APPEAL THIS THERE IS A TRANSACTION TRIBUNAL SO THERE'S ALWAYS A CHANCE TO GO BACK, AND CHALLENGE IF OTHER PEOPLE, ARE GETTING CHARGED SOMETHING DIFFERENTLY FOR THEIR ADU. YOU CAN ALWAYS COME BACK TO THAT. LET'S SEE WHAT OTHER QUESTIONS? LET ME SEE IF I'VE GOT MORE THAT I CAN SHARE. WITH STAFF. LET'S SEE HERE.
00:22:08.794: >> CHRIS, IF YOU CAN PULL UP ONE THING I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE WITH THE COMMISSION IS THE ADU FACT SHEET SENT OUT VIA PRESS RELEASE AND SHE HAD.
00:22:16.636: >> CORRECT. CAN YOU SEE IT RIGHT NOW?
00:22:20.373: >> NO, NOT YET.
00:22:21.307: >> NOT YET? ONE SECOND HERE. LET'S GO. I CAN SEE IT -- HERE WE GO. THERE, CAN YOU SEE IT NOW? GREAT. AND AS BRETT HAD JUST MENTIONED THIS WAS ALSO PART OF THE STAFF REPORT AND SENT OUT WITH THE PRESS RELEASE TO THE PUBLIC AND WITH THE SOCIAL MEDIA BLITZ THAT WE HAD. THIS IS REALLY I THINK A REAL GOOD FACT SHEET, JUST A REALLY KIND OF GENERALIZES, THE PROPOSED CHANGES, AND WHAT WE'RE -- WHAT'S EXISTING AND WHAT'S PROPOSED. SO, OUR SINGLE-FAMILY USE PROPERTIES ELIGIBLE, CURRENTLY FOR ATTACHED, YES, THEY ARE? YES, SO YOU CAN SEE IN THE WHAT WE'RE PROPOSED IN THE PROPOSED CODE. ARE MULTIPLE FAMILY USE PROPERTIES ELIGIBLE? CURRENTLY, NO THEY ARE NOT. BOTH IN THE CURRENT AND THE PROPOSED LANGUAGE. SAME WITH DETACHED ACCESSORY UNITS, THEY ARE NOT BUT IF WE WERE TO APPROVE THIS THOSE NS ARE GOING TO TURN TO YS, ALLOWING SINGLE-FAMILY AND R2A ZONING DISTRICTS CURRENTLY AS THE CODE IS WRITTEN, YES, THEY ARE
00:23:25.938: >> I JUST WANT TO CORRECT SOMETHING THERE. SO THIS IS ACTUALLY, USED PROPERTIES, SO, ACTUALLY, NOTHING WOULD -- THAT WOULD NOT CHANGE. THERE'S NOTHING THAT PROPOSED AMENDMENTS WILL ALLOW AN ADU ON A MULTIPLE FAMILY PROPERTY.
00:23:40.052: >> THAT'S -- YES.
00:23:41.454: >> REGARDLESS OF ZONING DISTRICT ANY MULTIPLE FAMILY USE PROPERTIES WOULD NOT BE ELIGIBLE.
00:23:46.559: >> AND THOSE ARE, YOU KNOW, R3S AND R4S AND EVEN R2AS IF YOU HAPPEN TO HAVE DUPLEXES ON THEM R2A AND B, ALLOWING OTHER RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS, CURRENT CODE NO THEY ARE NOT. I THINK THAT'S WHAT BRETT WAS JUST ALLUDING TO, YES, PROPOSED CODE WE ARE GOING TO ALLOW THOSE IN OTHER RESIDENTIAL WITH A SINGLE-FAMILY ON THEM NO, CURRENT CODE NO, PROPOSED CODE, YES, AND THAT'S FOR THE DETACHED. DOES THE PROPERTY OWNER HAVE TO LIVE ON-SITE? CURRENTLY, IT IS REQUIRED. WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED, IT IS NOT BUT IF WE -- THE CURRENT CODE, YES, IT'S REQUIRED, AGAIN, IT WOULD NOT BE REQUIRED IF WE MAKE THE PROPOSED CHANGES. IS A DEED RESTRICTION REQUIRED? YES, BUT, AGAIN, -- AND THAT'S, YES, FOR BOTH OF THOSE, BUT NO, IN BOTH THE PROPOSED CODE, THE -- FOR THE ATTACHED AND DETACHED. AND AS MINIMUM LOT SIZE REQUIRED? YES, IT IS 5,000 SQUARE FEET CURRENTLY BUT, NO, WE'RE LOOKING AT RELAXING THOSE BOTH FOR THE ATTACHED AND DETACHED, AND THEN FINALLY IS ADDITIONAL PARKING REQUIRED? YES, IT IS BUT WE'RE LOOKING AT REMOVING THAT LANGUAGE, SO PROPOSED FOR ATTACH AND DETACHED, NO, IT WOULD NOT. AND WE CAN ALWAYS GO BACK TO ANY OF THESE THESE SHEETS, LET ME GO TO -- ADDITIONAL INFORMATION,
00:25:13.211: >> (CONTINUING). OKAY, CAN YOU SEE THE WATER RATES? SHEET HANDOUT. GREAT, THIS, AGAIN, I THINK WAS BROUGHT UP AT ONE OF THE MEETINGS REGARDING WELL, WILL IT -- IT INCREASE THE TIERS? NO, FOR THE ADU. IT WILL BE BASED ON THE RESIDENTIAL 1. I THINK WHAT MAY BE A LITTLE CONFUSING IS IT DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH -- SINCE THEY'RE GOING TO BE HOOKED UP TO THE SAME WATER HEATER. THE MORE WATER YOU USE, THE MORE YOU'RE GOING TO GET CHARGED SO 1 THROUGH 9CCS IS 201, AND THEN AS YOU KEEP INCREASING, THAT RATE DOES GO UP, BUT YOU'RE STILL UNDER THE TIER 1, I HAD TO LOOK IT UP MYSELF, I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT A C C-1 IS, ONE CC EQUALS 100 CUBIC FEET, 748 GALLONS WHICH IS A STANDARD MEASUREMENT OF WATER. SO IT STILL STAYS UNDER THE SAME TIER, IT'S NOT GOING TO MOVE UP, YOU KNOW, RESIDENTIAL 2 OR, YOU KNOW, MULTIFAMILY RATES, THEY'RE GOING TO BE ON THE SAME WATER METER BUT AS YOU USE MORE WATER, YOUR RATES WILL GO UP. LET'S SEE... WE ALSO -- I WILL SAY THAT, JEFF, IS ALSO AVAILABLE IN THIS MEETING, IF WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, I THINK SOME QUESTIONS, THAT AROSE FROM HOW SEATTLE PORTLAND VANCOUVER, AND CALIFORNIA DEALT WITH THOSE, SO HE'S OPEN TO ANSWERING ANY OF THOSE QUESTIONS. THE DEFINITION OF FAMILY, WAS ALSO INCLUDED IN THE PREVIOUS STAFF REPORT. WE CAN REFER TO THAT BUT IT IS IN THE STAFF REPORT. AND I THINK, AS FAR AS THE INFORMATION THAT I WAS GOING TO PRESENT WITH HANDOUTS, THAT CONCLUDES MY PRESENTATION, BUT I CAN REFER BACK LIKE I SAID TO ANY OF THOSE HANDOUTS OR THE PREVIOUS POWERPOINT PRESENTATION. AND I'M OPEN TO ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE, AND MAYBE BRETT'S GOT SOME MORE TO ADD
00:27:13.332: >> THANK YOU, DOESN'T LOOK, BRETT, LIKE YOU HAVE ANYTHING. CHAIR:  SO LET'S OPEN THE PUBLIC HEARING AND THEN WE'LL -- I'LL READ THE MOTION AND WE'LL GET TO DISCUSSION, AND ASKING THOSE QUESTIONS. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY, FOR PERSONS TO SPEAK FOR UP TO THREE MINUTES ABOUT THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE UDC REGARDING ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS. TO CLARIFY, WE WILL ALLOW ANYONE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ADU PUBLIC HEARING EVEN IF YOU'VE MADE A COMMENT AT PREVIOUS MEETINGS, THERE WAS A -- AN -- IN OUR LAST CHANGE TO THE BYLAWS, KIND OF PREVIOUS PRECEDENT, THAT WAS ONE OF THE CHANGES THAT WE MADE; AND SO, WE WILL ALLOW ANYONE TO SPEAK AGAIN FOR THE FIRST TIME AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING. PUBLIC COMMENT, MAY BE MADE BY CALLING 877-8535247, 990, 9896, 8122, MEETING I.D. CITY STAFF WILL SELECT CALLERS WHO HAVE RAISED THEIR HAND. CALLING ON YOU ONE BY ONE BY THE LAST THREE DIGITS OF YOUR TELEPHONE NUMBER, AGAIN, YOU RAISE YOUR HAND DIGITALLY BY PRESSING STAR 9 ON YOUR TELEPHONE. AROUND THE SAME TIME, THAT MR. LEONARD CALLS THE LAST THREE DIGITS OF YOUR TELEPHONE NUMBER YOU SHOULD GET AN AUTOMATED THE HOST IS ALLOWING YOU TO SPEAK, PLEASE MOVE TO A QUIET AREA, MUTE ANY BACKGROUND SOUND INCLUDING TELEVISION, THE TELEVISION SO THAT WE CAN HEAR YOU CLEARLY. AND PLEASE, ALSO STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS AT THE BEGINNING OF YOUR COMMENT, AND PLEASE DO KEEP YOUR COMMENT TO THREE MINUTES OR LESS. WE'VE GOT A NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN LINE, SO -- STAR 9 IF YOU WANT TO JOIN THE QUEUE
00:28:51.697: >> PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 411, CALLER WITH PHONE NUMBER, 411, YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
00:29:00.205: >> THANK YOU, MR. LEONARD, AND COMMISSIONER MILLS, MY NAME IS JAMES D., AND I AM A FORMER MEMBER OF THIS BODY, HAVING IN THE 2000S, I WANTED TO SHARE SOME THOUGHTS TO YOU AS REVIEW THESE ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS, LANGUAGE TONIGHT. CERTAINLY, IN MY TIME, A FOR MANY YEARS, THERE'S BEEN GREAT INTEREST IN THESE, AND MANY ASPECTS. THEY ARE PROMISING IN THE CITY ENCOUNTERING PERENNIAL GROWTH PRESSURES, THAT BEING SAID MY THOUGHTS. WE NEED TO CONSIDER LOSS OF OPEN SPACE, STANDALONE BUILDINGS ARE MORE EASILY PERMITTED SETBAC NEED TO BE CONSIDERED WHEN STANDALONE BUILDINGS ARE CONSUCTED TO NEIGHBORS' TREES, BUILDING TOO CLOSEO A POTENTIALL MEAN THE REMOVAL OF SOONE ELSE'S PRID LANDMARK TREE. I'M PLEADO SEE TOGHT, THE CONCNS BEING ADDRESSED. ABOUT PUTTG MORE IMPERVIOUS SURFACE  AND REMOVG TREES HOW DOEST SQUE WITH A2 GOE IMPROVIN THE TE CANOPY. I'VE ALSO SN DISCUSSED IN SOALMEDIA, OTHEITY CALLING R LANGUE ORDINCE THAT SPULATES THAT ADUS MUST BE BUILT, ON PROPERTIES THAT ARE OWNED OR OCCUPIED. I SEE THE LANGUAGE PROPOSED TONIGHT IS CALLING FOR THAT. MY CONCERN WITH THIS IS -- IF WE WERE TO ABANDON THIS PREMISE, WE VERY WELL VIRTUALLY REDESIGNATING R1 ZONING AS R2 AND UPWARD IN CERTAIN NEIGHBORHOODS OF THE CITY. THESE CHANGES COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE CHARACTER POTENTIALLY QUALITY OF LIFE OF THE CITY AS WELL AS ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS. TO BE SURE, I'M NOT SPEAKING NECESSARILY AGAINST THESE CHANGES. %-P SWEEPING PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT. THIS REALLY NEEDS TO BE FOLDED INTO THE OVERALL CITY MASTER PLAN REVISION PROCESS AS A PREVIOUS SPEAKER SAID. THAT BEING SAID, LOOKS LIKE A LOT OF GOOD WORK HERE, AND THANK YOU FOR CONSIDERING MY REMARKS, THANK YOU, (CONCLUDES)
00:31:04.363: >> SARAH MILLS, CHAIR:  THANK YOU.
00:31:12.204: >> CALLER WITH PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 820. CALLER WITH PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 820, YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
00:31:23.582: >> CAN YOU HEAR ME?
00:31:25.017: >> SARAH MILLS, CHAIR:  YOU'RE VERY FAINT IS THERE ANY WAY TO TURN UP YOUR VOLUME.
00:31:28.453: >> CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW?
00:31:29.555: >> SARAH MILLS, CHAIR:  WE CAN GO AHEAD.
00:31:31.023: >> MY NAME IS VICTORIA, AND I LIVE ON HENRY STREET, WHILE I AM NOT OPPOSED TO DENSER HOUSING I AM OPPOSED TO THE WAY THE COMMISSIONERS ARE GOING ABOUT THIS ADU PROCESS, THAT SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT THE DEEP LACK OF INTENTION BEING DISPLAYED TOWARDS MITIGATING POWERFUL CONSEQUENCES THE PLANNING COMMISSION HAS STATED SEVERAL GOALS FOR THIS SUDDEN INTEREST, IN RUSHING THROUGH THESE ADU CHANGES, MOST OF THEM, LIKE, FAMILY ELDER CARE AND HOUSING ADULT CHILDREN IS ALREADY SERVED BY THE ORDINANCE AS IS. THE PROPOSED CHANGES PRIMARILY WOULD BENEFIT PEOPLE OR ORGANIZATIONS, WITH ENOUGH CAPITAL TO BUILD ADUS AS A WAY TO ENRICH THEMSELVES THROUGH RENTAL INCOME. BY DOING SO THE PLANNING COMMISSION SAYS IT WOULD CREATE MORE DIVERSE HOUSING AND INCREASE HOUSING AFFORDABOUT BUT THESE OPROPOSED ADU CHANGES IS A WHOLLY INEFFICIENT WAY TO MEET BOTH GOALS, I CAN SEE IN THE AGGREGATE, THERE CAN BE SOME AFFORDABILITY BENEFITS WHEN INCREASING, HOUSING DENSITY, AS A FORMER NEW YORK CITY RESIDENT I THINK A LOT OF GOOD CAN COME FROM DENSER HOUSING BEYOND AFFORDABILITY LIKE MORE VIBRANT COMMUNITIES AND LESS SPRAWL BUT IF WE'RE NOT CAREFUL AND STRATEGIC INSOFAR AS THIS ADU PROPOSAL IS NEITHER WE CAN CONFINE NEIGHBORHOODS TO RAPIDLY INCREASING PRICES AS PUSH FOR DENSER HOUSING ADUS ARE EXPENSIVE TO BUILD, THAT MEANS THE KIND OF PEOPLE WHO BUILD ADUS AS A WAY TO EARN MORE MONEY THROUGH ENT, WEALTHIER PEOPLE, INVESTORS OR MANAGEMENT COMPANIES, EXPENSIVE BUILDS LEAD TO EXPENSIVE RENT. IF THE CITY WANTS TO PROMOTE DENSER MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING THERE ARE MUCH MORE TRANSPARENT WAYS TO DO SO INCLUDING THE CITY'S ONGOING CONVERSATION ABOUT REZONING AROUND TRANSIT BORDERS, INSTEAD, PLANNING COMMISSION IN THIS CASE HAS OPTED FOR A SPEEDY AND COVERT ATTEMPT TO ESSENTIALLY CHANGE ZONING DESIGNATIONS UNDER PEOPLE'S NOSES WHICH MAKE MOW M MISTAKE THAT'S WHAT BERRY PROPOSING PROPERTIES NOW SINGLE UNITS, TO HOLD MULTIPLE FAMILY UNITS, THERE ARE SO MANY OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO ENCOURAGE MORE DIVERSE AND DENSER HOUSING, YET THE PLANNING COMMISSION HAT SET ITS SIGHT OPINCREASING MORE ADUS JUST TWO YEARS AFTER LESS DRAMATIC PROPOSED ADU CHANGES FAILED THE COMMISSION, WHAT IS THE RUSH? WHO IS ASKING FOR THIS? AND ARE THERE MORE EFFECTIVE WAYS TO ADDRESS HOUSING DENSITY AND AFFORDABILITY? I END BY REITERATING THAT BY REMOVING THE OWNER OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENT FOR BUILDING AN ADU, AND ALLOWING ADUS ON NONOWNER OCCUPIED PROPERTIES TO BE RENTED, THIS ORDINANCE WOULD EFFECTIVELY SUBJECT ALL SINGLE-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL AREAS TO POTENTIAL REZONING. WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE FOR MORE ADU
00:34:00.639: >> 30.
00:34:01.106: >> AND WHETHER OR NOT THE PROLIFERATION OF ADUS WOULD ACTUALLY INCREASE AFFORDABLE HOUSING, I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THE PROPOSED ADU CHANGES CAN BE INTERPRETED, AS ANYTHING BUT A GROSS CIRCUMVENTION OF THE CURRENT REZONING PROTOCOL, AND THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR LISTENING.
00:34:18.056: >> SARAH MILLS, CHAIR:  THANK YOU.
00:34:26.898: >> CALLER WITH PHONE NUMBER ENDING IN 326, CALLER WITH PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 326, YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE COMMISSION.
00:34:36.308: >> SARAH MILLS, CHAIR:  WE CAN HEAR YOU.
00:34:40.345: >> GREAT MY NAME IS JEFF I LIVE AT 506 EAST KINGSLY, AND TWO YEARS AGO, WHEN THE ADU PROPOSAL, FIRST CAME UP. I EXPRESSED CONCERN TO THIS GROUP, ABOUT HOW THE ENFORCEMENT WAS GOING TO WORK. AND, THE RESPONSE I GOT, FROM ONE OF THE PLANNING COMMISSION MEMBERS, AT THE TIME WAS, THAT, ENFORCEMENT IS UP TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD. I WAS VERY CONCERNED WITH THAT RESPONSE. SO SEVERAL WEEKS AGO, WHEN THIS MATTER -- THE AMENDMENTS WERE BROUGHT UP, I -- ONCE AGAIN -- EXPRESSED MY CONCERN, ABOUT ENFORCEMENT, AND, SPECIFICALLY, REQUESTED THAT THIS BE INCLUDED IN THE AGENDA FOR CONVERSATION OR AT LEAST I WAS HOPING THE STAFF REPORT WOULD INCLUDE AN ENFORCEMENT PROVISION, BUT I SAW THE ENFORCEMENT PROVISION SEVERAL DAYS AGO, AND IT INCLUDED NOTHING ABOUT ENFORCEMENT. NOW, THIS IS -- I SENT TWO LETTERS, EXPRESSING MY CONCERNS, SO I'M VERY SERIOUS ABOUT THIS. AND JUST FOR THE PUBLIC: THE QUESTIONS I WANTED ANSWERED WERE -- WHAT IS THE ENFORCEMENT PLAN? HAS A COMPLAINT FORM BEEN IDENTIFIED? BECAUSE YOU CAN'T JUST SAY, "YOU SHOULD REPORT SOMETHING ON AN E-MAIL" WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT THE PROPER FORMAT IS GOING TO BE. THERE SHOULD BE SOME CONSISTENCY, JUST IN THE FIX IT PROGRAM. WILL A CASE NUMBER BE ASSIGNED TO EACH COMPLAINT? IT MAKES IT EASIER TO TRACK? WILL NEIGHBORS OF ADU APPLICANTS BE INFORMED IN ADVANCE OF THE INTENT TO BUILD AN ADU? THAT IS JUST A COMMON COURTESY. BECAUSE, THIS ORDINANCE IS SO COMPLICATED IT WOULD GIVE A LITTLE TIME FOR RESIDENTS TO LOOK AT THE ORDINANCE AND SEE IF THE ORDINANCE IS BEING FULFILLED OR NOT. WILL A DESCRIPTION OF EACH COMPLAINT AND ITS OUTCOME BE PUBLISHED? IF SO WHERE? THIS IS ALREADY DONE WITH AID TO FIX IT. BY MAKING IT TRANSPARENT, IT ALLOWS THE COMMUNITY TO KNOW, WHERE -- IF A MANAGEMENT COMPANY BUYS A PIECE OF PROPERTY, BEFORE IF IT IS -- ORDINANCE HAS BEEN VIOLATED, AND FINALLY STAFFING NEEDED TO ENFORCE THE ORDINANCE, BEEN CONSIDERED?
00:37:12.063: >> 30 MORE SECONDS.
00:37:12.764: >> AND FRANKLY, I HAVE NOT SEEN IN ANY ORDINANCE REVISIONS, BEING PROPOSED, AND THIS SHOULD BE A REAL CHANGE, THE -- THERE SHOULD BE, IN THE REPORT, AN ESTIMATE OF HOW MUCH TIME IT SHOULD TAKE, FOR THE ORDINANCE TO BE ENFORCED; OTHERWISE, IF YOU DON'T HAVE -- WE'RE -- WE'RE ADDING A NUMBER OF ORDINANCES NOW, IF WE DON'T HAVE THE STAFFING, THERE WILL BE NO ENFORCEMENT. THANK YOU, FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.
00:37:41.626: >> SARAH MILLS, CHAIR:  THANK YOU. AGAIN, IF YOU'RE -- ON THE PHONE, AND WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A PUBLIC COMMENT, PLEASE PRESS STAR 9, TO INDICATE THAT.
00:37:56.474: >> CALLER WITH PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 677. CALLER WITH PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 677. YOU CAN UNMUTE YOUR PHONE AND ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION
00:38:05.317: >> CALLER:  HI, THIS IS MICHELLE HUGHES. AND I'M CALLING TO SAY, THAT I AM IN FAVOR OF THE ADU CHANGES. I THINK THAT, WE HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS GOING ON, AND ANYTHING THAT HELPS US GET NEW HOUSING BUILT IS GOING TO HELP US TAKE CARE OF THE HOUSING CRISIS. IT'S GOING TO ALLOW THERE TO BE, YOU KNOW, TWO UNITS OF HOUSING, WHERE PREVIOUSLY THERE WAS ONE, AND, I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, IF THAT'S -- YEAH, THAT'S GOING TO BE A GREAT WAY TO ADD DENSITY TO THE NEIGHBORHOODS. WITHOUT... YOU KNOW, TOTALLY TEARING UP THE NEIGHBORHOOD, AND -- AND BUILDING -- AND BUILDING NEW THINGS, AND MORE NEIGHBORS MEANS POTENTIALLY MORE COOL NEIGHBORS, AND THAT'S WHAT I LIKE TO SEE IN TOWN. AND, SO... YEAH, I THINK WE'VE -- IT'S BEEN THE PLANNING COMMISSION, AND -- AND THE CITY COUNCIL'S INTENT TO HAVE ADUS IN TOWN. SINCE, YOU KNOW, WE KNOW THAT THEY'VE PASSED, ADU ORDINANCE BEFORE. BUT IT'S -- WE HAVEN'T SEEN VERY MANY ADUS ACTUALLY BEING BUILT, SO -- I THINK IT'S -- REASONABLE, AND PRUDENT TO MAKE SOME CHANGES TO ADDRESS THE CAUSES OF THE ADUS NOT BEING BUILD, IF INDEED, WE WANT TO SEE ADUS BEING BUILT. SO IT SEEMS LIKE THESE -- THE PROPOSED CHANGES HERE, GO TO ADDRESS THE CAUSES OF WHY WE'RE SEEING ADUS NOT BE BUILT. AND I HOPE IT WORKS, I WOULDN'T MIND HAVING SOME MORE COOL NEIGHBORS AROUND HERE! THANK YOU
00:39:56.828: >> SARAH MILLS, CHAIR:  THANK YOU.
00:40:03.635: >> CALLER WITH PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 455. CALLER WITH PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 455. YOU CAN UNMUTE YOUR PHONE AND ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION. (A PAUSE), CALLER WITH PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 455 YOU CAN PRESS STAR 6 TO UNMUTE YOUR PHONE. AND ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION,
00:40:28.393: >> HELLO IS THAT ME?
00:40:29.294: >> SARAH MILLS, CHAIR:  IT IS.
00:40:30.395: >> OKAY. GREAT.
00:40:32.163: >> CALLER:  MY NAME IS JOHN B. I LIVE IN THE -- NORTH CENTRAL NEIGHBORHOOD, WHICH IS R4C ZONED NEIGHBORHOOD. I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY IN GENERAL I SUPPORT ADUS AND DENSITY, AND, YOU KNOW, I UNDERSTOOD WHEN I MOVED INTO AN R4C NEIGHBORHOOD THAT MEANT MULTIUNIT PROPERTIES, YOU KNOW, AROUND MY NEIGHBORHOOD. HOWEVER, I -- AND I -- THE WAY I UNDERSTAND THE -- THE WAY THE PROPOSAL IS BEING WRITTEN NOW IS THAT PROPERTIES THAT ARE MULTIUSE, PROPERTIES, YOU KNOW, THAT ARE USING R2 OR R4 CONSTRUCTION, WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO HAVE ADUS. BUT, I MEAN, I THINK SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IN THE ZONING IS THE KIND OF CURRENT ABUSE OF THE LOOPHOLE OF THE SIX NONRELATED PEOPLE IN ONE HOUSE. SO, I THINK WE HAVE A LOT OF PROPERTIES IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD, AND OTHER NEIGHBORHOODS, WHERE, PEOPLE IN A HOUSE BNG PART OF GROUP HOME,HAT THE MANAGEMENTOMPANIES HAVDONE, ESSEIALLY HE BUILT 6-UN APARENT BUILDINGS,ASQUERADE SO YOU'VE G 6 UNITS, 6 LEASES, X PEOPLE COMG AND GOING, ALL YOU KNOW, AELATED UNIT MILY. AND, TT -- TSEOUSES ARE SING-FAMILY HOS, EN THOUGH THEY'RE 6 UNIT, 6 RENTAL UNIT PLACE, THEY ARE CONSIDERED BY ZONING, R1 PROPERTY. AND UNDER THE WAY THE CURRENT ZONING IS WRITTEN, YOU'RE GOING TO ALLOW AN ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT ON THOSE PROPERTIES. SO, AGAIN, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE SIX UNITS, PLUS, ANOTHER ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT, WHICH COULD HAVE MORE PEOPLE. SO YOU'RE TALKING, YOU KNOW, 14 + PEOPLE COULD BE LIVING ON ONE PROPERTY THAT'S REALLY ONLY CAPABLE OF HAVING A SINGLE-FAMILY HOME ON IT. SO, I MEAN, TO ME THAT'S SOMETHING THAT REALLY NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. I MEAN, IN GENERAL. BUT DEFINITELY NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AS PART OF THIS ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT ADDITION. SO -- I GUESS -- JUST THE LAST COMMENT, I THINK TO ME, LIKE, AS A HOMEOWNER, LIKE, THE ZONING LAWS ARE KIND OF MY CONTRACT WITH THE CITY. THAT I EXPECT THEM TO ENFORCE. BECAUSE WHEN I DECIDED TO BUY IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD, AND, YOU KNOW, INVEST IN MY PROPERTY, YOU KNOW, I EXPECT THE ZONING LAWS TO BE RESPECTED; SO, YOU KNOW --
00:43:05.216: >> TEN MORE SECONDS.
00:43:05.950: >> YOU KNOW, IF I'M SUDDENLY LIVING NEXT TO A PLACE THAT HAS 14 PEOPLE LIVING ON IT, THAT'S NOT WHAT I BOUGHT INTO IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD COMMUNITY. SO THANK YOU.
00:43:17.262: >> SARAH MILLS, CHAIR:  THANK YOU.
00:43:27.871: >> CALLER WITH PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 077. CALLER WITH PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 077, YOU CAN UNMUTE YOUR PHONE AND ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
00:43:38.249: >> CALLER: YEAH, HI, THIS IS ERIC Z. OVER IN WARD 2. 2435 PRAIRIE IF YOU NEED MY ADDRESS, I'M AN ANN ARBOR RESIDENT AND I'M A HOMEOWNER. AND I JUST LIKE TO SAY THAT I AM VERY IN FAVOR OF THE CHANGES THAT ARE PROPOSED TODAY. FOR THE ADUS. I HAVE CONSIDERED BUILDING AN ADU AT MY HOUSE, BUT MY LOT IS A CORNER LOT AND IT'S VERY NONCONFORMING FOR THE CURRENT ADU SITUATION. AND, OUR HOUSE IS NICE FOR NOW, BUT, I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A SMALLER AREA THAT I COULD AGE IN PLACE, AND I THINK, AN ADU WOULD BE A GREAT WAY TO DO THAT. AND IF I COULD BUILD IT NOW, I COULD MAYBE, YOU KNOW, HELP PAY OFF MY MORTGAGE, EARLY, SO FOR ME IT WOULD BE A GREAT IDEA. I THINK IT WOULD BE GREAT FOR MY NEIGHBORHOOD TO HAVE SOME NEW HOUSING, IN A GREAT NEIGHBORHOOD THAT IS BUILT UP ALREADY; WE'RE ALREADY BUILT ON ALL THE LOTS HERE, SO IT'S NOT, LIKE, WE'RE GOING TO GET ANYMORE DENSITY IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD ANY OTHER WAY. ADUS AREN'T THE WHOLE SOLUTION TO OUR PROBLEMS IN ANN ARBOR, BUT THEY'RE A PART OF IT. THEY'RE A SMALL PART OF A BETTER SOLUTION, I DON'T UNDERSTAND THESE CALLERS TALKING ABOUT THINGS BEING RAMMED THROUGH, QUOTE/UNQUOTE, AT THESE PUBLIC HEARINGS, THEY'RE PUBLIC HEARINGS. AS FAR AS I REMEMBER WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT ADUS FOR YEARS NOW. AND, IF THIS DOES GET PASSED TO PLANNING IT'S GOING TO LIKELY GO TO COUNCIL. AND I'M SURE THERE WILL BE A FEW PUBLIC HEARINGS THERE, SO, RAMMING THROUGH, IS NOT EXACTLY WHAT I WOULD CONSIDER IT. AND AS FAR AS ALL THE REQUIREMENTS RIGHT NOW, TO BUILD AN ADU, LIKE, WE DO NOT REQUIRE NOTICE TO OUR NEIGHBORS, IF I WANTED TO BUILD AN OUTBUILDING IF I WANTED TO BUILD A SHED, A GARAGE, SOMETHING TO HOUSE A CAR IN, I WOULDN'T HAVE TO TALK TO MY NEIGHBORS ABOUT IT, I COULD JUST BUILD A GARAGE, I CAN BUILD IT ALMOST RIGHT UP THE LOT LINE. I CAN BUILD IT, YOU KNOW, WITH A BASIC PERMIT, SO WHY ARE WE MAKING IT, EASIER TO BUILD A PLACE FOR A HOUSE -- I'M SORRY, FOR A CAR TO LIVE? WHY WOULD WE MAKE IT EASY FOR A CAR TO BE HOUSED IN OUR CITY, BUT NOT EASY FOR A PERSON? ADUS COULD BE A REALLY GREAT WAY TO HOUSE PEOPLE, RENTERS, WOULD BE ABLE TO LIVE IN AREAS, WHERE, PREVIOUSLY ONLY HOMEOWNERS COULD LIVE AND THAT'S GREAT. GREAT TO ADD DIVERSITY TO OUR NEIGHBORHOODS. AND I WELCOME THEM. I HOPE YOU DO PLAN IT. AND I THANK YOU, FOR CONSIDERING IT. SARAH MILLS, CHAIR:  THANK YOU.
00:46:20.678: >> CALLER WITH PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 030. CALLER WITH PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 030. YOU CAN UNMUTE YOUR PHONE AND ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
00:46:34.392: >> DAVID S. BELMONT ROAD IN ANN ARBOR, I'M A HOMEOWNER, I WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS SEVERAL CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSED CHANGES. THE FIRST REGARDS THE PARKING CHANGE. MANY NEIGHBORHOODS IN ANN ARBOR REQUIRE RESIDENTIAL HOUSING TO PROVIDE PARKING. ADDING ADDITIONAL UNITS WITHOUT PARKING WOULD RESULT IN ON-STREET PARKING, WHICH WOULD CHANGE THE CHARACTER OF THE NEIGHBORHOODS. THE SECOND CONCERN REGARDS THE CHANGE IN THE SETBACKS, FOR RESIDENTIAL OCCUPIED BUILDINGS, DO GENERATE NOISE AND TRAFFIC, THIS WOULD ESSENTIALLY AMOUNT TO ALLOWING SUBDIVISION OF ANY RESIDENTIAL LOT INTO TWO RESIDENCES, I THINK THAT WOULD DRAMATICALLY CHANGE THE CHARACTER OF THE NEIGHBORHOODS, AND VIOLATE THE BASIC ASSUMPTION OF ZONING. THANK YOU.
00:47:35.052: >> SARAH MILLS, CHAIR:  THANK YOU.
00:47:40.758: >> CALLER WITH PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 556. CALLER WITH PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 556. YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION
00:47:52.136: >> HI, THIS IS RALPH AGAIN, 1116 RED OAK. I WANTED TO KIND OF CONCENTRATE ON TODAY, ON THE OWNER-OPENED REQUIREMENT. AND WHY -- OR WHY NOT -- THAT SHOULD BE RETAINED. AND I THINK, I WANTED TO RESPOND, FIRST, TO SORT OF THE GENERALIZED COMMENTS THAT I'VE HEARD, FROM SEVERAL CALLERS, AND COMMISSIONERS MAKE IN THE PAST. THAT WE SOMEHOW ASSUME THAT -- THAT, ELIMINATING THAT REQUIREMENT WILL RESULT IN -- IN MORE HOUSING, THAT MIGHT BE -- THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE TRUE. BUT, WHAT TYPE OF HOUSING, AND WHAT WOULD THE COST OF THAT HOUSING BE? AND I -- I WOULD WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS THAT, I DIDN'T CATCH HER NAME, BUT THE LADY WHO CALLED IN FROM HENRY STREET, EVERYTHING THAT SHE SAID, I THOUGHT WAS DEAD-ON POINT. AND I WOULD -- I JUST READ AN ARTICLE TODAY, A LOW-INCOME HOUSING ACTIVIST IN A CALIFORNIA CITY WHO SAID, "ALL THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WHEN YOU MAKE THIS CHANGE IS YOU'RE GOING -- THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO CAN AFFORD TO BUILD THESE GIVEN CURRENT COSTS ARE WEALTHY PEOPLE AND PEOPLE WHO ARE INVESTORS." AND WHAT THAT'S GOING TO MEAN IS THAT THE RENTS IN -- WILL GO UP, NOT DOWN. THIS IS A LOW-INCOME HOUSING ACTIVIST SAYING THIS. THIS ISN'T ME. I JUST -- AM REPEATING SOMETHING THAT I READ A COUPLE OF HOURS AGO, AND I THINK THOSE -- THOSE ARGUMENTS, ARE GOOD ARGUMENTS, BOTH SIDES, YOU REALLY HAVE TO VET THEM. AND I -- AND I HAVE NOT HEARD THAT DONE HERE. THE -- WE'RE JUST SORT OF ASSUMING SOMETHING, AND THERE ARE DEFINITELY VOICES FROM LOW-INCOME ACTIVIST COMMUNITIES THAT THINK, OF THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT I'VE -- WHAT I'VE HEARD, LOOSELY THROWN AROUND, IN SOME CONVERSATIONS HERE. AND I -- I THINK -- I WANTED TO FOCUS ON ONE OTHER COMMENT ABOUT THAT. KEEPING -- AVOIDING INVESTOR BUYS KEEPS HOUSES AVAILABLE FOR THE SALE MARKET FOR THE NEW HOME BUYERS. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THAT IS PER SE, ANTIRENTER. I THINK THERE IS LOTS OF WAYS TO ADD RENTAL HOUSING, THAT'S LARGE NUMBERS OF RENTAL HOUSING, AND, IN PLACES WHERE IT MAKES SENSE, THAT WOULD HAVE A LOT BIGGER IMPACT, THAN THIS, AND WOULD MAKE A LOT MORE SENSE,
00:50:27.725: >> 30 MORE SECONDS.
00:50:29.760: >> -- ELIMINATE THE OWNER OCCUPIED REQUIREMENT. I THINK A LOT OF THE OTHER CHANGES ARE -- ARE POSITIVE, AND IF WE CAN FIGURE OUT SOME WAY TO GET -- ENABLE HOMEOWNERS TO BUILD THEM, SOME LOAN PROGRAMS, AND THINGS LIKE THAT, THAT WOULD BE GREAT. BUT I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD ELIMINATE THE OWNER-OCCUPIED REQUIREMENT, AND MANY OF THE PEOPLE WHO WROTE YOU TODAY SAID THE SAME THING, THANK YOU.
00:50:50.147: >> SARAH MILLS, CHAIR:  THANK YOU.
00:51:01.325: >> CALLER WITH PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 534. YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
00:51:07.998: >> THANK YOU, THIS IS TOM S. CALLING FROM LOWER TOWN. I WANT TO ADDRESS THE CALLER WHO TALKED ABOUT ZONING AND EXPECTATIONS, AND HE IS SPOT-ON. I'VE BEEN IN REAL ESTATE NEARLY 30 YEARS AND MY FATHER WAS A REAL ESTATE DEVELOPER. I GREW UP WITH THIS STUFF AND ZONING IS A LOT ABOUT EXPECTATIONS. AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE MASTER PLAN PROCESS, TOO, YOU KNOW, I'LL BEAT THAT TO DEATH. BUT THAT'S WHERE WE ENGAGE IN COMMUNITY, AND WE ASK THE COMMUNITY, TO WORK WITH THE CITY, AND COME UP WITH A VISION, OF WHAT EVERYBODY WANTS. IT'S NOT GOING TO BE UNANIMOUS, BUT IT'S A GROUP-DECIDED VISION AND THAT'S WHERE, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE DO BUY IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS, CERTAIN EXPECTATIONS, YOU MIGHT BUY NEXT TO A PARK, A CITY PARK WITH A CERTAIN EXPECTATION. YOU MIGHT OWN A HOUSE, NEXT TO A HOUSE THAT ZONED OFFICE, AND YOU KNOW WHEN YOU BOUGHT YOUR HOUSE, THE HOUSE NEXT DOOR COULD BE TORN DOWN, AND OFFICE PUT UP. THAT WAS PART OF THE EXPECTATION. SO WHEN WE'RE DRASTICALLY CHANGING PEOPLE, WHAT THE SITUATION IS GOING TO BE COMPARED TO WHAT THEIR EXPECTATIONS ARE, THAT REALLY DOES POINT BACK TO WHY A MASTER PLAN REVISION IS THE PROPER PROCESS BEFORE WE HAVE A SWEEPING CHANGE THAT'S GOING TO IMPACT 20,000 RESIDENTS. ACROSS THE CITY. THIS IS A CONVERSATION, THAT BELONGS TO 99% OF THEM, NOT WHAT WAS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW, WHICH IS CONVERSATION THAT -- 99% OF THEM HAVE NO IDEA THAT'S GOING -- THIS IS GOING ON. MOST PEOPLE HEAR ADU AND THEY THINK THAT'S GREAT. THE TRADITIONAL THING TO THINK ABOUT ADU. THEY'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT A DETACHED 800 SQUARE-FOOT HOUSE, WHERE BOTH HOUSES COULD BE RENTAL PROPERTIES. AND THEY'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT IT ALL THE WAY BACK TO 3 FEET FROM THE PROPERTY LINE. SO, THOSE PEOPLE AREN'T PAYING ATTENTION, 99% OF THE PEOPLE AREN'T PAYING ATTENTION, SO I'M ALSO A BUYER'S BROKER. AND I'VE CONTACTED SOME OF MY CLIENTS, AND, YOU KNOW, -- I'VE HAD CLIENTS THAT LIVE IN A HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION, BDIVISION. THERE'S RULES THEY HAVE IN PLACE, BUSINESS. BUT THE BUILDG DEPARTMT ISN'T GOINGO CHECKTHE, THEY'RE ING TO ISS A PERT. THE OWN WHO WANTSO BUILD, AN AD I GOINGO BE IN CONFLICT WITH THE NEHBORS. IF THIS PERMIT IS ISSD BAUSE WE'RE DOIN IT. , THE WAY AIN, IFE HAVE THE PROPER EXPECTATIO, ARE SET,HEN WE PROBLEMS A THEN LASTLY AS A LALORD NOW, I HAVE SOME DUPLEXES ANDOME IRLY SLL HOUS WIT BIG YARDS, I CAN 30 MOR SECOS. IF I'M READING -- THIS RIGHT I CAN TAKE A SMALL HOUSE ONE BEDROOM UNIT AND A TWO BEDROOM UNIT IN IT, I CAN CONVERT THAT BACK TO ONE HOUSE WITH FOUR BEDROOMS IN IT AND I CAN BUILD A SECOND, 800 SQUARE FOOT, 4 BEDROOM HOUSE IN THE BACKYARD, MY R2, I WOULD HAVE TWO, HABITABLE UNITS SO I WOULD BE INCREASING THE DENSITY. I'M JUST LETTING PEOPLE KNOW AS A LANDLORD, I CAN THINK ABOUT HOW I CAN MAKE MONEY, ADUS, ARE THERE FOR CERTAIN GOAL, LET'S MAKE SURE WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH THIS ORDINANCE IS ACHIEVING THE GOAL THAT WE WANT TO ACHIEVE. THANK YOU.
00:54:14.718: >> SARAH MILLS, CHAIR:  THANK YOU. THANK YOU. CALLERS ON THE LINE, IF YOU WOULD LIKE, TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING PLEASE PRESS STAR 9 ON YOUR PHONE TO RAISE YOUR HAND.
00:54:30.434: >> CALLER WITH PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 269, CALLER WITH PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 269. PRESS STAR 6 TO UNMUTE YOUR PHONE AND ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION,
00:54:42.980: >> CALLER: HI, MY NAME IS -- THANK YOU, MY NAME IS CURT TAYLOR AND I LIVE AT 2055 MARSHON DRIVE IN LANDS TOWN, CHURCH ROAD NEAR SOUTH 7TH NEAR PIONEER, I WANT TO THANK THE COMMISSIONERS FOR VOLUNTEERING TO SERVE ON THE COMMISSION, IT TAKES UP YOURTUME AND PLACES YOU IN A POSITION OF PUBLIC VULNERABILITY. MANY PEOPLE, WOULD NOT SERVE ON THOSE POSITION IF THEY WERE PAID AND YOU SERVE WITHOUT PAY OR PERKS AND I APPRECIATE THAT. YOU ONLY HEARD ABOUT THE ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT CHANGES AND OF THIS MEETING BECAUSE A FRIEND TOLD ME ABOUT IT. BECAUSE THERE ARE BIG CITYWIDE CHANGES TO PEOPLE'S NEIGHBORHOODS IN THESE PROPOSED RULE CHANGES. I DON'T THINK IT'S RIGHT, THEY ONLY HEARD ABOUT PROPOSED CHANGES AND THIS HEARING BECAUSE A FRIEND HAPPENED TO TELL ME. LOCAL GOVERNMENT CAN BE PRETTY ARCANE CANE ESPECIALLY ZONING CHANGES EVEN WHEN PROPOSED CHANGES ARE HUGE, IF YOU DON'T HAVE A FRIEND WHO IS IN ARCANE STUFF LIKE I DO, I GUESS YOU DON'T GET TO BE HEARD IN ANN ARBOR, THAT'S NOT HOW IT'S SUPPOSED TO WORK. A LOT OF US HAVE WAITED FOR FOUR YEARS TO GET RID OF THE WE DON'T HAVE TO CARE WHAT YOU THINK GOVERNMENT IT SEEMS TO ME IT'S UPSETTING IT'S MOVING FROM WASHINGTON, D.C. TO ANN ARBOR, SURPRISINGLY, NO ONE I KNOW WANTS THE PEOPLE NEXT DOOR NEIGHBORS, TO PUT UP A TWO-STORY RENTAL BUILDING ON EITHER SIDE OF THIS BACK YARD. HAVING YOUR NEIGHBORS' HOMES BOUGHT UP WITH ABSENTEE LANDLORDS WHO CAN DO THIS WITHOUT EVEN DISCUSSING WITH, WITHOUT CARING WHAT THE IMPACT IS ON YOU, IS MUCH, MUCH WORSE. CAN YOU REALLY NOT GET WHAT A BIG CHANGE THE CITYWIDE POLICY WOULD BE? CAN YOU NOT SEE, THAT INVESTORS WITH CASH, WHO ARE NOT INTERESTED IN CREATING OR SUPPORTING A GOOD PLACE TO RAISE CHILDREN, WILL DRIVE FAMILIES OUT OF TOWN? IS THIS WHAT YOU WANT? IF YOUR GOAL IS TO DRIVE AN ENTIRE CLASS OF PEOPLE OUT OF ANN ARBOR, ESPECIALLY ONE THAT INCLUDES CHILDREN, I DON'T THINK YOU GET TO CALL YOURSELVES PROGRESSIVE ANYMORE. MAYBE YOU HAVE NOT REALIZED HOW FAR REACHING THESE CITYWIDE ZONING CHANGES WOULD BE, AND HOW YOUR PROCESS CUTS VOICES OUT OF THE GOVERNMENT. I ASK, THAT YOU TELL HOMEOWNERS WHAT YOU'RE PROPOSING AND HOW WIDE-RANGING THE IMPACTS WOULD BE, I'M TIRED OF GOVERNMENT THAT DECIDES FOR ITSELF, WHICH VOICES MATTER, WHICH ONES DON'T. AND ISN'T STRAIGHTFORWARD WITH PEOPLE. I THOUGHT WE WERE DONE WITH THAT. THIS MAY SOUND A BIT HARSH I KNOW BUT MORE PEOPLE THAN YOU KNOW, HAVE NO IDEA,
00:57:22.239: >> 30 SECTION.
00:57:22.840: >> YOU'RE PROPOSING THESE BIG ZONING CHANGES, IT'S NOT RIGHT THAT SOMETHING THIS HUGE IS UNDER THE RADAR. I DO APPRECIATE YOU BEING THERE, AND I APPRECIATE YOU LISTENING TO MY THOUGHTS, THANK YOU.
00:57:34.284: >> SARAH MILLS, CHAIR:  THANK YOU. WE HAVE ONE MORE PERSON IN THE QUEUE WITH THEIR HAND RAISED. IF ANYONE ELSE WISHS TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION, PLEASE PRESS STAR 9 ON YOUR PHONE
00:57:50.134: >> CALLER 644 GO AHEAD.
00:57:52.236: >> CALLER:  YES, MY NAME IS CATHY BORIS AND I LIVE AT 1726 CHARLTON. AND I WANT TO THANK THE PLANNING COMMISSION, FOR ALL THE HARD WORK THEY DO, AND ALL THE LONG HOURS THEY SPEND. AND I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE PREVIOUS CALLER, BECAUSE HE WAS PRETTY WONDERFUL. THANK YOU, SIR. IN MY VIEW, THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A BROADER DISCUSSION, OF WHETHER THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE ADU ORDINANCE, WILL BRING MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING, OR MORE GENTRIFICATION, BECAUSE IT WILL COST 100,000 TO $200,000, TO BUILD A NEW DETACHED ADU, THIS IS A WEALTHY PERSON'S GAME. PEOPLE BUILDING SUCH ADUS, WHETHER THEY ARE ANN ARBOR RESIDENTS, OR INVESTORS FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY, OR AROUND THE WORLD -- WILL -- WILL NOT DO SO, OUT OF THE GOODNESS OF THEIR HEARTS. THEY WILL WANT TO RECOUP THEIR INVESTMENT, AND THERE IS NO REASON TO THINK THAT THEY WILL CHARGE, ANY LESS THAN MARKET RATE RENTS. SO, AGAIN, I AM DISAPPOINTED THAT THERE WAS NO BROAD DISCUSSION, AS TO WHETHER THE PROPOSED AMENDMENT -- AMENDMENTS TO THE ADU ORDINANCE, WILL BRING MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING, OR MORE GENTRIFICATION, TO ANN ARBOR. THANK YOU, SO MUCH.
00:59:27.798: >> SARAH MILLS, CHAIR:  THANK YOU.
00:59:38.375: >> CALLER WITH PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 043. PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 043, YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
00:59:48.886: >> HI, MY NAME IS CYNTHIA. AND I'M AT 810 HENRY STREET. AND. ALL OF THE POINTS THAT WERE BROUGHT UP, REGARDING THE ADU AND THE ZONING, I AGREE WITH. BUT I JUST HAVE JUST A COUPLE OF THINGS TO ADD, AND THAT IS, THE PUBLIC NOTICE. THERE WAS A DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT, AT THE LAST MEETING. AND, MY TAKE ON IT, WAS THAT, IT WAS SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BE A BIT CHALLENGING TO DO; AND I LIKE TO KNOW WHAT THE COMMISSIONERS, AND THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT, FINALLY DECIDE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO SEND THESE NOTICES OUT TO 20,000 PEOPLE. AND, THE OTHER ISSUE, I HAVE IS WITH PARKING. BECAUSE I CURRENTLY LIVE ON THE STREET, WHERE THE CURRENT PARKING SAYS THAT, YOU -- YOU BUILD, YOU HAVE TWO PARKING SPACES PER UNIT. SO IF YOU HAVE 9 SEPARATE UNITS, THAT MEANS YOU HAVE TO HAVE 18 PARKING SPACES, WELL, WE HAVE A SITUATION, WHERE, THERE'S NINE UNITS, AND EACH HAS 6 BEDROOMS. SO NOW THAT'S 54 POTENTIAL PARKING SPACES, SO WITH THE ADU, IS THAT GOING TO BE IN CONSIDERATION OF WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WITH STREET PARKING? SO, AGAIN, THOSE ARE MY -- ALONG WITH EVERYONE ELSE'S QUESTION ABOUT ZONING, AND HOW THIS ISN'T THOUGHT THROUGH, AND THE LAST THING IS HOW WAS THIS DETERMINED? WHO BROUGHT THIS TO THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT WHERE IT WAS SO URGENT? AS I UNDERSTAND, THERE'S 23 APPLICATIONS, SINCE 2016. SO, WHO -- WHAT IS THE URGENCY, AND WHAT IS THE RUSH? AND, AGAIN, I PLEASE URGE YOU, TO SEND OUT PUBLIC NOTICES, SO EVERYONE TRULY KNOWS, WHAT'S AT STAKE HERE. THANK YOU, VERY MUCH.
01:02:05.422: >> SARAH MILLS, CHAIR:  THANK YOU. IF ANYONE -- COMMISSIONER? OH, YOU'VE -- YOU GOT YOUR HAND UP. IF ANYONE ELSE ON THE LINE, WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION, PLEASE PRESS STAR 9, ON YOUR PHONE, NOW, TO INDICATE THAT.

01:02:36.186: >> CALLER:  YES, GREETINGS. ANN ARBOR PLANNING COMMISSION, THIS IS LUIS VASQUEZ. I'M LOCATED AT 1442 PONTIAC TRAIL. IN THE FIRST WARD, AND, JUST WANTED TO SPEAK, IN SUPPORT OF ADUS, AND, IN FACT, I WOULD LOVE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF UPZONING ALL OF ANN ARBOR. I THINK WE NEED TO ALSO, CONSIDER GETTING RID OF PARKING MINIMUMS, AND -- I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING, AND -- TAKE ALL OF THE CRITICISM OF ADUS, UPZONING, AND, OTHER MASTER PLAN REFORMS, THAT ARE NEEDED, IN OUR CITY, WE HAVE A VERY SEVERE HOUSING CRISIS GOING ON. IN ANN ARBOR, AND, WE NEED TO FIX THAT. SO, ONCE AGAIN, THANK YOU, FOR YOUR TIME, AND, GOOD NIGHT.
01:03:48.391: >> SARAH MILLS, CHAIR:  THANK YOU. IF THERE'S ANYONE ELSE ON THE LINE, WHO WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION, PLEASE PRESS STAR 9. ON YOUR TELEPHONE. TO INDICATE THAT. ALL RIGHT.
01:04:06.109: >> DON'T SEE ANYBODY INDICATING.
01:04:08.078: >> SARAH MILLS, CHAIR:  VERY GOOD, I WILL CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING THEN AND READ THE MOTION, THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION HEREBY RECOMMENDS THE MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL APPROVE THE AMENDMENTS TO CHAPTER 55 ZONING, SECTION 5.15 TABLE 15-2, AND SECTION 5.16.6, ACCESSORY USES AND STRUCTURES. COULD I HAVE THAT MOVED BY A COMMISSIONER? MOVED BY COMMISSIONER MILSTEIN, SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER S, WE ARE IN DISCUSSION, WHO WANTS TO KICK US OFF? COMMISSIONER S.?
01:04:44.080: >> COMMISSIONER:  THANK YOU, COMMENTS CONCERNS ABOUT OCPANCY, SO I WOULD JUST LIKE TO GO OVER THAT WITHTAFF AGAIN, WITHOW THIS IS WRITTEN, WH THE ADU WOULD DO, IS, REDISTRIBUTE MAXIM OCCUPANCY CURRENTLY, BASED ON ZONING OF THAT T,HERE WOULD BE NO INCREASE IN ZONING, CORREC WOULD HAVEWO UNRELATED RSONS MIMUM IN THE ADU. PLUS WHATEV, YOU KNOW, UP TO, WHATEVER IS FT, WHICH I'M SURE UNRELATED,ND THEIROFFSPRIN R LESS WE G INT R4ND ABOV IN THEOUPLE O SNARIOS WE SAONE THAAS DUPLEX CONVERGED BACK INTO A ADDED IN THAT CASE, IT CLDN'T BE TWO, FOUR BEDROOMS, IN THAT CASE WE WOULD STILL ONLY HAVE, FOUR UNRELATED ADULTS ON THAT LOT. EVEN IF IT WAS RECONFIGURED TO BE A SINGLE-FAMILY AND AN ADU, INSTEAD OF A DUPLEX, CORRECT?
01:05:46.209: >> THAT IS CORRECT, COMMISSIONER S. YOU'VE GOT IT. IT'S -- R1 AND R2, UP TO 4, BUT NO MORE THAN 2 IN THE ADU, WE NEED R3 AND R4, TO MAXIMUM OF 6, BUT ONLY, AGAIN, 2 IN THE ADU. I THINK WHAT SOME OF THE CONFUSION MAY BE COMING IS IF -- IF YOU R2 AND YOU HAVE A DUPLEX, THEN -- AND YOU MEET THE MINIMUM LOT SIZE YOU COULD HAVE FOUR AND 4, THEN, IN THE DUPLEX BUT NOT IN THE ADU.
01:06:12.369: >> BECAUSE THE -- WE'RE TALKING UNIT BY UNIT, FOR A DUPLEX, OR AN R4C, AND THAT CIRCUMSTANCE, BECAUSE THAT CAUSE KIND OF ANOTHER ONE THAT WAS BROUGHT UP.
01:06:22.312: >> YEAH.
01:06:22.579: >> COMMISSIONER:  IS THE 6 UNRELATED, AND THEN, KIND OF THE IDEA THAT 14 UNRELATED PEOPLE COULD HAPPEN, BUT THIS ORDINANCE SAYS IT MUST BE A SINGLE-FAMILY HOUSE WITH AN ADU. THERE'S NO POSSIBILITY OF AN ADU, WITH A MULTIUNIT BUILDING. WITH IT, CORRECT?
01:06:40.463: >> THAT'S CORRECT. AND ALSO, JUST TO REINFORCE:  IF THESE AREN'T OWNER OCCUPIED, THEY WILL BE REGISTERED WITH THE CITY'S RENTAL HOUSING DEPARTMENT. SO, BOTH OF THEM ARE -- AT MINIMUM, ARE GOING TO BE INSPECTED. THEY GO THROUGH THE BUILDING DEPARTMENT AND HOUSING RENTAL FOR REVIEW ORIGINALLY AND WE'LL PUT ON THE DOCUMENTS THAT -- IF WE STARTS SEEING FOUR BEDROOMS OR SOMETHING, BUT, YOU KNOW, THEIR CAPPED AT 800 SQUARE FEET, IT WILL -- IT WILL TRIGGER SOME RED FLAGS. SO THEY WILL BE INSPECTED. THEY WILL HAVE REGULAR RENTAL INSPECTIONS TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE MEETING, WITH THESE OCCUPANCY MINIMUMS. WHAT THEY ARE
01:07:15.098: >> COMMISSIONER:  OKAY, AND THEN, IF -- IN ALL OF THESE CASES, KIND OF GOING TO PARKING, WE'RE, AGAIN, NOT INCREASING, THE OCCUPANCY, AND, ANY UNIT ON THESE PROPERTIES, WOULD ALREADY MEET PARKING REQUIREMENTS, AND SO SINCE WE'RE NOT INCREASING OCCUPANCY, A -- SINGLE-FAMILY COULD BE CONFIGURED WITH MULTIPLE BEDROOMS. WITHOUT ANY ADDITIONAL PARKING, RIGHT?
01:07:41.257: >> THAT'S SOMEWHAT CORRECT. WHEN YOU DO ADD AN ADU YOU HAVE THE POTENTIAL OF ADDING TWO ADDITIONAL RESIDENTS SO YOU MAY NATURALLY THINK, YES, THEY MAY HAVE A CAR, BUT WE'RE LOOKING AT CHANGING THAT WE'RE GOING TO ELIMINATE ALL THE PARKING REQUIREMENTS, AND IN THIS CASE BECAUSE I THINK JUST ABOUT ALL OF THE -- THE RESIDENCES, SINGLE-FAMILY -- EVEN FOR R2 AND R4, THEY'RE ALL WITHIN A QUARTER MILE OF A BUS STOP, SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE TRYING TO ELIMINATE THE PARKING REQUIREMENT, IT SEEMS BRETT WANTS TO ADD SOMETHING ALSO.
01:08:14.891: >> BRETT:  I GUESS I HEARD THE QUESTION A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY, I THINK IF YOUR QUESTION, COMMISSIONER WAS REGARDING PARKING IT'S SIMILAR TO THE OCCUPANCY, THAT IS, IF -- IF, YOU KNOW, AN ADU ATTACHED TO A SINGLE-FAMILY UNIT IS STILL CONSIDERED A SINGLE-FAMILY UNIT. AS -- AS YOU, AND A THE CITY PLANNER DISCUSSED IT DOESN'T EXPAND THE OCCUPANCY, IT REDISTRIBUTES THE SAME MAXIMUM OCCUPANCY AMONGST THE PRIMARY UNIT AND AN ADU. LIKEWISE, I THINK THE QUESTION OF PARKING -- WE DID ORIGINALLY HAVE A PROVISION IN THE CODE, WHERE WE CURRENTLY HAVE A PROVISION IN THE CODE THAT SAYS ADDITIONAL PARKING IS REQUIRED. I THINK TO THE QUESTION YOU WERE GETTING AT IS, IF WE ALLOW THE SAME OCCUPANCY, WHY WOULD THE PARKING NEED TO FLUCTUATE IF IT TRULY IS A REDISTRIBUTION OF THOSE? SO --
01:09:01.538: >> COMMISSIONER:  GREAT OKAY.
01:09:03.039: >> BRETT:  I JUST WANTED TO ADD THAT, THAT'S WHAT I WAS HEARING AND IT GOES HAND IN HAND WITH OCCUPANCY LIMITS.
01:09:10.747: >> COMMISSIONER:  AND I'M JUST TRYING TO OPEN UP, PLAN OUT THE SCENARIO BASED ON A LOT OF THE CALLS, TO CLARIFY WHERE WE ARE AND ARE NOT INCREASING DENSITY INTENSITY AND THOSE SORTS OF THINGS BECAUSE THERE SEEMS LIKE THERE'S A LOT OF CONCERNS AND I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY WHAT WE'VE GOT HERE. THE NEXT ONE I KIND OF WANT TO GO THROUGH IS SINGLE-FAMILY PLUS AN ADU VERSUS A DUPLEX. AND THAT THIS ISN'T UPZONING, BECAUSE, ONLY ONE PERSON COULD OWN A LOT, WITH A SINGLE-FAMILY AND AN ADU. WHERE A DUPLEX, COULD BE A SPLIT DEED WITH TWO OWNERS ON THE SITE, CORRECT?
01:09:45.849: >>, YEAH,.
01:09:46.282: >> COMMISSIONER:  THAT WOULD BE THE MAIN DIFFERENCE BETWEEN, SAY, UPZONING TO, YOU KNOW, R2 EVERYWHERE, VERSUS, R1, WITH AN ADU. AND, OCCUPANCY, AGAIN, DOESN'T CHANGE, WHERE IF WE WERE UP ZONING TO A DUPLEX, WE COULD, AGAIN, HAVE FOUR AND 4, WHERE THIS IS 4 TOTAL, SO VERY MUCH DIFFERENT THAN UPZONING, THIS IS STILL SINGLE-FAMILY WITH ADU, MAINTAINING OCCUPANCY, WE'RE JUST REDISTRIBUTING BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND MANY SINGLE-FAMILY HOMES PROBABLY AREN'T OPTIMIZEED AND MAXIMIZED FOR ITS CURRENT OCCUPANT LOAD THAT'S ALLOWED BY CODE. WHAT ELSE DID I WANT TO GO WITH THIS? PARKING -- ENFORCEMENT. THAT'S THE OTHER THING, ENFORCEMENT PER THE UDC, IS ACROSS ALL OF OUR ORDINANCES, RIGHT? WE DON'T CUSTOMIZE ENFORCEMENT FOR EVERY SINGLE CODE. WE HAVE A STANDARD PROCEDURE FOR ANY AND ALL ORDINANCES WITHIN THE UDC, CORRECT?
01:10:48.111: >>, YEAH, TYPICALLY, YOU KNOW, TO GO BACK TO THAT ENFORCEMENT QUESTION, IT IS, YOU KNOW, IT'S STILL NEIGHBORS WHO DO ALERT US TO ANY TYPE OF ENFORCEMENT. IT'S NOT THAT WE'RE ACTIVELY GOING OUT, LOOKING FOR THIS, BUT IT WILL BE THE NEIGHBORS WHO ALERT US AND I CAN'T SPEAK FOR OUR CURRENT ZONING COORDINATOR BUT WHEN I DO ENFORCEMENT ON OVEROCCUPANCY IN THE PAST WE DO SET UP FILE NUMBERS IN OUR TRAIK-IT SYSTEMS. WE TRY TO GET LEASES FROM THE PROPERTY OWNER LOOKING ONLINE MAKE SURE THEY'RE NOT ON AIRBNB NOT ADVERTISING THIS SOMETHING AS A SHORT-TERM RENTAL. WE TRY TO LOOK AT THE MAILBOX AND SEE HOW MANY NAMES ARE IN THE MAILBOX INDICATING HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE LIVING THERE SO WE DO A FAIR AMOUNT OF INVESTIGATION, AND THIS IS TRANSPARENT, IF THE PUBLIC WANTS TO LOOK INTO TRACK, OR GIVE THE COORDINATOR OR ENFORCEMENT PERSON A CALL, WE WILL FOLLOW UP.
01:11:39.829: >> SARAH MILLS, CHAIR:  GREAT.
01:11:40.997: >> BRETT:  I WOULD JUST ADD ON TO THAT, THESE PROVISIONS A ATYPICAL FROM OUR RENTAL INSPECTION PROGRAM. WE INSPECT ALL RENTAL PROPERTIES IN THE CITY. THE SAME QUESTIONS ABOUT OCCUPANCY ARE MEASURED EVALUATED AND AT TIMES CONTESTED AS PART OF THAT PROCESS, TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF SCALE:  I DON'T KNOW THE EXACT AMOUNT BUT I THINK WE HAVE OVER 30,000 UNITS IN THE CITY THAT WE ARE INSPECTING ON A REGULAR BASIS, SO, YOU KNOW, I -- I TOTALLY AGREE WITH CHRIS, YOU KNOW -- AND YOUR PREDICATE. WE DON'T SET UP SORT OF DISTINCT ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS WITHIN THE UDC. BUT I -- I FEEL THAT WE DO HAVE, THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE, TO ADDRESS THESE PROPOSED CHANGES. LIKE THE BASICALLY, BECAUSE WE'RE DOING SIMILAR WORK, IN A VERY BROAD BASIS ACROSS THE CITY, CURRENTLY.
01:12:39.055: >> SARAH MILLS, CHAIR:  GREAT. I THINK, THOSE ARE MANY OF MY COMMENTS, ONES I WANTED TO KIND OF RAISE FOR DISCUSSION, AND THEN, I GUESS, OH, I DO WANT TO RAISE AFFORDABILITY, I KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING WE TOUCHED ON BRIEFLY LAST TIME, WHAT WOULD BE, MECHANISMS, (COMMISSIONER), THERE'S JUST A COST THAT WE'VE LOOKED -- UNDERSTOOD, THE TAX PROPERTY TAX RAMIFICATIONS OF THIS AND THE CONSTRUCTION COST OF THIS. WHAT WOULD BE A PROCEDURE FOR TAX ABATEMENT PERCENTAGE EMI PREMIUMS AOTHER SORT OF THINGS,I THINK WE'RE ALREADY AT THE UPPER THRESHOLD OF CARROTS AND STICKS SO PUTTING MORE REQUIREMENTS ON THIS IS NOT THE GOAL OF THIS AT THIS POINT. AND SO FIGURING OUT OTHER PROBABLY OUTSIDE OF THE UDC, WOULD IT BE A MEMO TO CITY COUNCIL TO RECOMMEND ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATION INTO TAX ABASEMENTS? ABATEMENTS, PARTNERSHIPS WITH -- FOR -- YOU KNOW, 60% AMI RELATIONSHIPS WITH HOUSING COMMISSIONERS AND WHAT SORT OF SCENARIOS MIGHT PLAY OUT TO MAKE THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS AND THINGS OUTSIDE OF OUR REALM?
01:13:46.856: >> BRETT:  SO HLIKE YOU DESCRIBED, YOU COULD COMMUNICATE WHATEVER RECOMMENDATIONS YOU HAVE IN THAT REGARD. I WOULD -- YOU KNOW, I WOULD I GUESS I WOULD ASK THE PLANNING COMMISSION, TO BE SPECIFIC, DO YOU THINK IT IS SORT OF IMPORTANT, AT -- TO BE DONE, AND ANSWERED, IN CONTEXT OF THIS -- PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENTS? IF YOU -- IF YOU RECOMMEND THEM TO THE CITY COUNCIL? OR DO YOU ENVISION THEM, YOU KNOW, -- LET ME START OVER. HOWEVER YOU CAN CLEARLY COMMUNICATE TO THE CITY COUNCIL YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE ORDINANCE CHANGES, EITHER, INDEPENDENT, OR IN CONCERT WITH THOSE TYPES OF RECOMMENDATIONS. I WOULD THINK WOULD BE IMPORTANT. BUT IF YOU DO WANT TO MAKE THOSE TYPES OF RECOMMENDATIONS, A MEMO A RESOLUTION, THAT SUGGEST THAT, I -- I DON'T HAVE DIRECT ANSWERS. SOME OF THE THINGS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, THEY'RE NOT REALLY ZONING-RELATED. THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY -- NOT REALLY EVEN LAND-USE RELATED TO AN EXTENT, SO I DON'T REALLY HAVE THE ANSWER AS TO WHERE THAT WOULD LIE, HOW THAT WOULD, YOU KNOW, HOW THAT WOULD BE RESOURCED. BUT, YEAH, IT WOULD BE -- YOU KNOW, YOU ARE ADVISING THE CITY COUNCIL ON THIS, AND IT COULD DEFINITELY BE ACCOMPANIED BY THAT KIND OF, ANCILLARY INFORMATION OR RECOMMENDATIONS FOR EXPLORATION. I WILL JUST SAY, FROM AN AFFORDABILITY PERSPECTIVE:  I -- YOU KNOW, WE, WE HAVE THESE REQUIREMENTS, WITH SOME OF OUR OTHER ORDINANCES. THEY CAN BE -- AFFORDABILITY CAN BE CHALLENGING FOR MARKET RATE PROPERTY OWNERS, TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT. IT'S NOT TO SAY IT CAN'T BE DONE. BUT WHEN WE START ADDING THOSE REQUIREMENTS, EITHER THROUGH PREMIUMS OR THROUGH PUD, THAT COMES WITH EXPECTATIONS OF MANAGEMENT, OPERATION, DOCUMENTATION, ON REGULAR BASIS, AND CONSEQUENCE, AND, GENERALLY, I THINK -- I THINK IT'S PROBABLY BETTER, TO APPROACH THAT FROM MAYBE A FINANCING, OR ANOTHER ENTITY THAT MIGHT SUPPORT THOSE RATHER THAN THE CITY TRYING TO DO THAT ON A VERY, SORT OF WIDESPREAD, SEPARATE BASIS OF A BUNCH OF SEPARATE UNITS WITH A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT PROPERTY OWNERS, BUT IN ANY EVENT, WHATEVER I WOULD SAY WHATEVER YOU THINK THE -- THE APPEALING OUTCOMES WOULD BE, YOU KNOW, HOWEVER YOU WANT TO COMMUNICATE THAT, THAT CAN -- THAT CAN HAPPEN. IT CAN'T BE DIRECTIVE, OBVIOUSLY, AND IT [AWAY FROM MICROPHONE] >> COMMISSIONER:  I MEAN, LIKE, IT'S BEEN RAISED, THIS HAS BEEN, ON THE BOOKS FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS, WE'VE ONLY SEEN, YOU KNOW, 20 +, ACTUALLY, BUILT, WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE MULTIPLE OTHER INQUIRIES, INTO THIS, THAT WE CAN ACTUALLYCALCULATE, WHICH WHY IT'S COMING UP AGAIN TO TRY TO LOOSEN -- MAKE IT EAER. WITH -- I THINK, SENSIBLE REGULATION, BUT ILL ME IT EASY. SO, FOR MORE OF THESE TO HAPPEN, THEN ONLY 23 SO IHINK ERE'S SOME UENCY T IT THAT WHICH ISHY WE'RE DOING THI NOW, SO IUPPORT IT. I'M OPEN TOHE5% SETBACKS. I' SAVE TT FOR FTHER SCUSSION THE, AND I GUE MY LAST POINT, I JUST KIND OF WANTED TO RAISE ABOUT THE OWNERSP VERSUS THE RENTER- ANEVEN IF TSE CSE GHER RE RATESF THEY'RE CHARGING A LOT FOR THEM, RIGHT NOW, THERE ISN'T SOMETHING TO BE CHARGED FOR, SO, MORE UNITS WITH HIGHER RENT, WE'VE HEARD SCENARIOS, TOO, WHERE IT COULD BE SOME FAMILY MEMBER, LIVING IN ONE OF THESE, INSTEAD OF OCCUPYING A CONDO, OR A RENTAL UNIT DOWNTOWN, AND SO, SUPPLY DOES HAVE A FACTOR INTO THIS. AND IF WE CAN KIND OF OFFSET, INCREMENTAL WAYS I THINK THAT'S A BENEFIT. EVEN IF THEY ARE AT MARKET RATE. MORE UNITS ARE BETTER THAN, YOU KNOW, EMPTIER BACKYARDS AND I'M COMFORTABLE WITH 35%, WITH THE SETBACK, THERE ARE SENSIBLE WAYS NOT GETTING COMPLETE INFILL OF BACKYARDS FOR THIS AS WELL. SO I'LL LEAVE IT THERE, THANK YOU
01:17:55.304: >> JUST TO CLARIFY, COMMISSIONER S., BEFORE WE MOVE ON, WHEN YOU SAID THE -- THE SETBACK, YOU -- YOU MEANT 5 FEET, RATHER THAN 5%, RIGHT?
01:18:04.547: >> SORRY, I'M GOOD WITH FROM 3 TO 5, FOR DISCUSSION.
01:18:08.017: >> THAT'S A POINT OF DISCUSSION, BUT YOU'RE NOT PROPOSING IT AS A --
01:18:12.388: >> AS AN AMENDMENT, NO, I JUST KIND OF WANT TO PUT IT OUT THERE I'M OPEN TO IT AS THE DISCUSSION MOVES FORWARD.
01:18:20.596: >> COMMISSIONER, DISCH AND COMMISSIONER CLARK (SARAH MILLS, CHAIR).
01:18:24.600: >> COMMISSIONER DISCH:  THANK YOU, COMMISSIONER S. FOR ASKING THE QUESTIONS THE WAY YOU DID. THOSE ARE THINGS I NOTED AND YOU DID IT CLEARLY THAN I THINK I WOULD HAVE. I WANT TO COME BACK TO THE POINT YOU MADE ABOUT COUNCIL BUT I WANT TO SAY A COUPLE OF THINGS FIRST, I WANTED TO RAISE, THE ISSUE OF AFFORDABILITY. AND I THINK, WE CAN LOOK AT THIS, FROM A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT LENSES. THERE'S WILL THESE BE AFFORDABLE IN THE WAY THAT WE ARE DEFINING AFFORDABLE HOUSING THROUGH OUR -- OUR HOUSING ON PUBLIC LANDS PROJECT? NO. THEY WON'T BE. BUT THEY ARE SMALL, THEY ARE SMALL HOUSES, THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH RENT YOU CAN CHARGE, AND SO, THEY WILL BE OPENING UP IN AREAS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY MOSTLY RESTRICTED TO HOMEOWNERS. THEY'LL BE OPENING UP RENTAL HOUSING, FOR PEOPLE WHO CAN'T AFFORD TO BUY IN THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS OR MAYBE NOT IN THE CITY AT ALL. AND THEY WILL BE SMALL HOUSES. AND, AS YOU SAID, BEAUTIFULLY, OUR -- YOU SAID IT TOO BEAUTIFULLY FOR ME, TO REPEAT IT WITHOUT MANGLING IT, BUT WE'RE NOT USING THE HOUSING THAT WE HAVE, EFFICIENTLY AND WE'RE NOT USING THE SINGLE-FAMILY PARCELS THAT WE HAVE EFFICIENTLY RIGHT NOW, BECAUSE WE'RE ACTUALLY NOT MAXED OUT ON OCCUPANY, AND MANY OF US, MIGHT. OR SOME OF US, MIGHT BE MORE INTERESTED IN MAXING OUT ON THE OCCUPANCY, IF THERE WERE AN INDEPENDENT DWELLING, RATHER THAN A PERSON LIVING IN THE BEDROOM NEXT TO ME. THAT ISN'T MY OFFSPRING, SO THIS IS A VERY EFFICIENT WAY TO USE THESE PARCELS THAT WERE CUT AT A TIME WHERE WE WEREN'T WORRIED ABOUT SPACE. WHERE WE WEREN'T WORRIED ABOUT CLIMATE. WE CAN USE THESE -- THESE PARCELS BETTER. I -- I WANTED TO RAISE THIS -- SO, SO AFFORDABILITY IS IN ONE WAY, BROUGHT IN BY THE SIZE OF THESE THINGS, WE CAN ALSO LOOK AT THE DATA. WE CAN LOOK AT THE DATA FROM VANCOUVER, WHERE, 35% OF THEIR HOUSING STOCK IS ADUS AND YOU'VE HEARD ME SAY THIS BEFORE, BUT WE MIGHT HAVE A DIFFERENT AUDIENCE TONIGHT. SO, ACCORDING TO A 2018 SURVEY OF ADU OCCUPANTS IN THE CANADIAN CITY OF VANCOUVER, 1/3 OF ADU OCCUPANTS HAD INCOMES AT OR BELOW THE MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME IN VANCOUVER. SO THAT'S A GOOD THING. THAT MEANS THAT THEY ARE SERVING PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT THE WEALTHIEST. THE PEOPLE WHO ARE CREATING THEM, MAY BE RELATIVELY WEALTHY PEOPLE WHO CAN AFFORD TO BUILD THEM, BUT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING IN THEM ARE NOT. SO, WE WANT TO KEEP THAT DISTINCTION CLEAR. YOU KNOW, NOT JUST WHO'S PROMPR PROFITING OFF OF THEM, BUT WHO IS USING THEM:  LAST TIME I CHECKED, INVESTORS CAN BUY A HOUSE ANYWHERE THEY WANT TO IN ANN ARBOR, THEY CAN BUY THE HOUSE NEXT DOOR TO ME RIGHT NOW AND THEY CAN RENT IT OUT RIGHT NOW. AS OUR LAWS STAND RIGHT NOW, WHEN AN INVESTOR BUYS A HOME, THEY HAVE CAOUPLE OF OPTIONS, THEY CAN RENT OUT THAT HOME. THEY CAN TEAR DOWN THAT HOME, BUILD A BIGGER ONE AND EITHER RENT IT OR SELL IT FOR A BIGGER PRICE, THAN THEY BOUGHT IT FOR. WE ARE OPENING UP THIS LAW -- WOULD OPEN UP, THIS ORDINANCE CHANGE WOULD OPEN UP ANOTHER OPTION FOR INVESTORS, WHICH IS TO BUILD A SECOND SMALLER HOUSE, RENT THEM BOTH, AND ACCOMMODATE TWO HOUSEHOLDS ON A LOT THAT USED TO ACCOMMODATE JUST ONE. (PAUSE), THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO TO STOP PEOPLE FROM INVESTING IN HOUSES IN ANN ARBOR. WE CAN'T STOP THAT. AND I WOULD ARGUE THAT THE INCENTIVE THAT THIS ORDINANCE OPENS UP IS AN INCENTIVE FOR A BETTER USE OF LAND THAN THE BUILDING OF 300 SQUARE FOOT -- 3,000 SQUARE FOOT HOUSES. AND, SO, YES, -- AND THEN I JUST WANTED TO TELL YOU, THAT, I DIDN'T KNOW WHEN I WOULD RAISE THIS IN THE MEETING BUT I WANTED TO JUST LET YOU KNOW WHAT I'VE BEEN THINKING OF ADUS PHASE 2. AND I AM REALLY PLEASED, THAT ON THE -- THE PLANNING COMMISSION HAS OPENED UP THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR ADUS, AND -- REMOVED SOME OF THE REGULATORY OBSTACLES, SUCH AS OWNER OCCUPATION, AND THE MINIMUM LOT SIZE AND A FEW OTHER THINGS AND THE PROHIBITION AGAINST NEW DETACHED ADUS. BUT NOW THE QUESTION IS HOW DO WE REDUCE SOME OF THE ECONOMIC OBSTACLES AND MAKE BUILDING AN ADU OPEN AS AN OPTION TO A -- PEOPLE, IN A WIDER RANGE OF INCOMES? AND I -- I AM PLANNING, TO TAKE THAT UP WITH STAFF, I'LL HAVE SOME EXPLORATORY CONVERSATIONS AND SEE IF IT'S FEASIBLE:  HOW MIGHT IT BE FEASIBLE? DO WE USE PARCELS THAT ARE SORT OF GREENING THESE, ELECTRIC, DO WE USE PRICE INCENTIVES FOR MAKING THEM MORE AFFORDABLE? THAT SEEMS COMPLICATED BUT M MAYBE, EXPLORE THIS, IS IT SO DIFFICULT THAT IT'S NOT WORTH THE EFFORT? OR NOT? AND ALMOST NOTHING IS SO DIFFICULT THAT IT'S TOTALLY NOT WORTH THE EFFORT, AND SO I SUSPECT, WHAT I'LL FIND, IS, STAFF WILL GIVE YOU SOME RECOMMENDATIONS AND THEN I WILL LOOK TO BUILD SUPPORT AMONG MY COLLEAGUES ON COUNCIL TO CREATE A RESOLUTION, AND BRING THAT TO COUNCIL. SO THAT IS ALREADY ON MY MIND. THAT THIS IS THE NEXT STEP, BUT THAT'S THE STEP AFTER WE SEND THIS ROUND OF CHANGES, TO COUNCIL. AND SO, I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR THINKING ABOUT THAT, AND I WOULD WELCOME ANYTHING THAT YOU-ALL WANT TO TELL ME, THAT YOU WOULD LIKE ME TO LOOK INTO WITH THE HELP OF OUR STAFF.
01:24:28.530: >> COMMISSIONER CLARK? COMMISSIONER CLARK:  SO I'LL BE BRIEF, BECAUSE I PRETTY MUCH AGREE WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S BEEN SAID. I JUST WANTED TO MENTION THE -- ONE QUICK QUESTION ON JUST THE QUESTION ABOUT THE HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION, JUST FOR CLARITY OF IT. IS THE -- THE -- THE HOMEOWNER, IF THERE WAS A HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION, IT'S NOT, LIKE, THIS -- WOULD OVERRIDE THE HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION. THAT THERE ARE RULES IN PLACE THAT FORBID ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS, THOSE WOULD STILL HOLD I'M ASSUMING AND THEY WOULD HAVE THE RECOURSE OF SUING, YOU KNOW, -- I'M NOT SURE WHO I GUESS, THE HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION OF THEIR NEIGHBOR, IS THAT TRUE
01:25:08.370: >> THAT'S CORRECT. ZONING DOESN'T SUPERSEDE, OR SOMEHOW, INVALIDATE DEED RESTRICTIONS. HOWEVER, THE CITY, IS ALSO, NOT -- DOESN'T HAVE ANY AUTHORITY OR SORT OF PARTY TO THOSE HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS OR DEED RESTRICTIONS, SO WE ALSO DON'T MONITOR AND ENFORCE THEM. BUT, IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE, YOU, AS THE PROPERTY OWNER, YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE MEETING BOTH THE CITY REQUIREMENTS, WHICH, OBVIOUSLY, WE VERIFY THROUGH THE PERMITTING PROCESS, BUT THEN ALSO BE AWARE, AND THAT YOU ARE COMPLIANT WITH ANY DEED RESTRICTIONS, ON YOUR -- AS A PROPERTY OWNER, AT THAT LOCATION
01:25:46.341: >> COMMISSIONER CLARK:  THANK YOU, AND THEN, JUST A QUICK COMMENT ABOUT THE AFFORDABILITY, AND -- I THINK, THE -- THIS IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION OF KIND OF DIVERSIFYING OUR HOUSING STOCK AND ADDING A DIFFERENT TYPE, AND KIND OF WHAT LISA MENTIONED -- OR MRS. DISCH MENTIONED, THIS WOULD BE SMALLER SIZES AND THE INVESTMENT IN NEIGHBORHOODS IS HERE, IT'S COMING AND WHETHER OR NOT IT'S -- THEY'RE INVESTING IN LARGER FOOTPRINT, SINGLE-FAMILY HOUSING, EVEN SOMETIMES, AS RENTALS, OR, ADUS, TO GET THE HIGHER NUMBERS, WHICH WOULD PROBABLY BE BETTER FOR THE MARKET AS A WHOLE. BUT I WAS GOING TO ALSO SAY, THAT THERE'S JUST ONE THING, LIKE, -- A LARGE INVESTOR, FROM A -- THE STANDPOINT OF A LARGE INVESTOR ON THESE, MANAGING A WHOLE BUNCH OF SINGLE INDIVIDUAL UNITS LIKE THIS, SEEMS PRETTY INTENSIVE ON EFFORT, AND OVERSIGHT. IT'S NOT, LIKE, MANAGING ONE COMPLEX OR SOMETHING OF APARTMENTS, SO I THINK THAT THE ODDS OF, LIKE, A SINGLE INVESTOR COMING IN AND TRYING TO MANAGE A WHOLE NUMBER OF THESE PROPERTIES, IS PRETTY UNLIKELY, ALMOST PRETTY MUCH, YOU KNOW, NOT REALLY A SERIOUS, CONCERN. AND THEN ALSO WITH THE HOUSING AFFORDABILITY. I THINK THE GOAL SHOULD REALLY BE, AGAIN, TO DIVERSIFY HOUSING STOCK AND NO ONE'S REALLY -- KEEP IN MIND NO ONE IS REALLY BEING DRIVEN OUT. OWNERS CAN SELL AS THEY WOULD LIKE, NOT THAT THIS IS FORBIDDING ANYTHING THAT'S CURRENTLY HAPPENING, AND THEN AFFORDABILITY ISN'T GOING TO COME WITH ANY SINGLE PARCEL AND I THINK THE GOAL NEEDS TO REALLY BE INCREASE SUPPLY SO WE CAN LOOK AT AGGREGATE AND SEE HOW RENTS CHANGE OVER TIME, AND CONSIDER THAT'S THE DIFFICULTY OF AFFORDABILITY WE'RE NOT GOING TO SEE A DRAMATIC CHANGE IN RENTS GOING DOWN OVERNIGHT, THAT ISN'T GOING TO HAPPEN ANYWHERE NO MATTER WHAT WE DO. BUT WE NEED TO BE LOOKING AT IT OVER WHAT'S GOING TO SLOW THE RATE OF INCREASE AND WHAT'S GOING TO PREVENT PROPERTY PRICES FROM INCREASING AND THE CLEAR ANSWER ACROSS ANY ACADEMIC STUDY YOU LOOK AT IN ANY OF BEST PRACTICE, IS THE INCREASE SUPPLY WILL SLOW THE RATE OF INCREASE FROM CURRENT TRAJECTORIES, THAT'S BEEN -- I MEAN, THAT'S PRETTY SOLID EVIDENCE TOWARDS THAT. SO I THINK THIS MOVES US TOWARDS THAT. AND THAT MAYBE, EXPECTING THIS JUST TO PUT DIRECTLY AFFORDABLE UNITS ON THE MARKET, SOMEWHAT MISSES THE BIGGER PICTURE OF HOW AFFORDABLE HOUSING COMES ABOUT. IN THE HOUSING MARKET. SO YEAH.
01:28:14.323: >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT.
01:28:17.292: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT: THANKS,O A FEW THIN, I WANTED TO CIRCLE BACK REALLY QUICKLY, TO ENFORCEMENT. AND, I APPRECIATED THAT RESPONS THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE, MY ONE FOLLOW-UP QUESTION WOU JUST BEO YOU SEE THE NEED FOR MORESTAFF? OR SOMETHING LIKE TH TO COME LINE, LIKE, DO YOU FEEL ADEQUATELY EQUPED TO MANAG
01:28:37.512: >>YEAH, I --
01:28:38.146: >> I MEA OF URSE, YOUEED MORESTAFF, RHT? BUT (CMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT) TO MAGE THIS PROCESS.
01:28:44.052: >> I DO. WE - I DON ANTICIPATE THAT THESE ANGES WOULD SO PERMS, AND PROJES THAT WE ARREVIING,ND EORCING ON A REGULAR BASIS AS -- CITY PLANNER SAID, IN ALL OF THESE CIRCUMSTANCES. OR IN THE VAST MAJORITY OF THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, NOT ALL. WE'RE ALSO GOING TO HAVE MORE TOUCH POINTS WITH THESE PROPERTIES BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO BE ON THOSE PROPERTIES INSPECTING THOSE UNITS ON A REGULAR ROUTINE BASIS, SO IT'S NOT TO SAY THAT, YOU KNOW, THERE WON'T BE ENFORCEMENT ISSUES, WE DO -- LIKE, WE SAID, WE DO HAVE THOSE, BUT IN SORT, I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO CREATE ANY NEW STRUCTURES, IN ORDER TO DO THAT. BUT TO, YOU KNOW, TO CHRIS'S POINT, IT'S -- IT'S JUST A BIT OF A RESOURCE QUESTION, HOW TRADITIONALLY WE'VE BEEN SORT OF -- WE PUT A LOT OF EFFORT INTO THE FRONT END. THE PERMITTING, THE REVIEW, THE ENSURING THAT THINGS ARE DONE RIGHT. THE FIRST TIME. WE ALSO, ARE -- WE TRY TO BE RESPONSIVE, AND TRANSPARENT, WHEN COMPLAINTS ARE INVESTIGATED, BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION, EITHER FROM A2 FIX IT FROM E-MAILS AND PHONE CALLS, TO BE CLEARS WE DON'T HAVE TEAMS OF STAFF SORT OF JUST PROACTIVELY OUT IN NEIGHBORHOODS POLICING ZONING ISSUES
01:30:11.440: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT: RIGHT.
01:30:12.841: >> SO, YOU KNOW, THESE PROPOSED CHANGES WOULD NOT -- I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT OUR ABILITY, TO IMPLEMENT THEM.
01:30:22.250: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT: IT'S HELPFUL TO KNOW IT'S A TRANSPARENT PROCESS ALREADY.
01:30:25.821: >> YEAH. AND I WOULD ADD EVEN THOUGH WE'VE ONLY HAD 23 IN THE PAST FOUR YEARS, I'M UNAWARE, THIS IS A VERY SMALL SAMPLE SIZE THAT WE'VE HAD ANY COMPLAINTS THAT WE'VE HAD TO FOLLOW UP ON.
01:30:37.799: >> I WOULD VENTURE THAT WE'VE HAD PROBABLY, MORE STAFF RESOURCES IN TO TALKING ABOUT THE POSSIBILITIES OF THESE. PEOPLE EXPLORING THEM. AND, THERE MIGHT BE SOME CHALLENGE WITHIN OUR CURRENT PROVISIONS WHERE THEY CAN'T PROCEED. SO -- BUT, AGAIN, I DON'T -- I'M -- I DON'T -- WE'RE STILL COMFORTABLE WITH THAT. THAT'S THE NATURE OF WHAT WE DO. WE WORK WITH PROPERTY OWNERS, AND PETITIONERS, TO EXPLORE THEIR PROJECTS. IDENTIFY WHAT WE THINK IS POSSIBLE. WHAT WE THINK IS CHALLENGING. AND THIS IS NO DIFFERENT.
01:31:11.633: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT: THANK YOU, CAN YOU GIVE US AN UPDATE ON THE POSTCARDS?
01:31:16.671: >>, YEAH, YEAH. SO, WE -- WE DIDN'T SEND -- WE ARE NOT SENDING POST CARDS OUT AND WE DIDN'T SEND POSTCARDS OUT TO ALL PROPERTY OWNERS, THIS IS A TEXT AMENDMENT, IT'S NOT A REZONING SO WE'RE FOLLOWING THE PROCEDURES THAT WE DID. I DID -- IN RESPONSE, TO THE CONVERSATION THAT WE HAD, AT THE PLANNING COMMISSION, I DID TAKE ADDITIONAL STEPS, BOTH YOU'LL RECALL IN ADVANCE OF THE WORK SESSION, AND IN ADVANCE OF THE FIRST PUBLIC HEARING, AND OF THIS PUBLIC HEARING, SINCE THE PARTICULARLY THE LAST PUBLIC HEARING WE DID PUT TOGETHER AT ADU FACT SHEET, AS A MEANS OF TRYING TO, PROVIDE A VERY CONCISE WAY TO COMMUNICATE PROPOSED CHANGES, WE SENT THAT OUT WITH OUR COMMUNICATIONS DEPARTMENT THROUGH ALL THE CITY'S SOCIAL MEDIA. WE ISSUED PRESS RELEASES, WE SENT IT OUT THROUGH THE GOV DELIVERY CHANNELS, SO, WE DID A MUCH MORE ROBUST OUTREACH, ON THIS, THAN WE WOULD TYPICALLY DO FOR UDC TEXT AMENDMENT. BUT, WE DID NOT -- WE DID NOT SEND IT TO ALL THE PROPERTY OWNERS, AS THAT'S NOT OUR TYPICAL PROCESS, AND I FRANKLY DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES, TO JUST DO THAT FOR ALL OF OUR TEXT AMENDMENTS
01:32:31.379: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT: THAT'S FAIR AND I WILL SAY I SAW THIS ALL OVER THE PLACE THIS WEEK ON ALL OF MY SOCIAL MEDIA. I -- I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE STILL CONCERNS FROM PEOPLE THAT THIS IMPACTS SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF PEOPLE. THEY DON'T KNOW -- YOU KNOW, 99% OF PEOPLE MIGHT NOT BE AWARE. I MIGHT WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROCESS, I AM WONDERING -- I DON'T KNOW IF CITY COUNCIL HAS A BUDGET FOR THIS. I DON'T KNOW IF COMMISSIONER DISCH -- IT COULD BE SOMETHING YOU EXPLORE THAT WAY. I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE, I FEEL COMFORTABLE THE BASES HAVE BEEN COVERED. I KNOW THIS KEEPS COMING UP, THIS HAS COME UP A LOT. IN TERMS OF, LIKE, MAKING, HOMEOWNERS AWARE THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT, COULD -- THAT BOTH THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD PEOPLE -- THEY ALSO, LIKE, MIGHT NOW HAVE THE OPPORTUNITIES TO BUILD IN THEIR BACKYARD. THANK YOU FOR THE UPDATE. GO AHEAD
01:33:21.029: >> I WOULD JUST ADD -- NOT TO -- RESPOND, ON BEHALF OF COMMISSIONER DISCH, BUT JUST THE NORMAL STRUCTURE OF ORDINANCE IS GOING TO CITY COUNCIL, YOU KNOW, I'M -- WE ADDRESSED, WE ADDRESSED THIS CONVERSATION, AND DECISION IN THE STAFF REPORT. I WILL MAKE SURE THAT THAT IS CONVEYED FORWARD AS IT GOES TO CITY COUNCIL, THAT THIS DIALOGUE HAPPENED. THE NATURE OF THE CITY COUNCIL CONSIDERATION IS THEY HAVE A FIRST READING. AND THEN, THAT -- SO THEY HAVE A CONSIDERATION OF THIS PROPOSED ORDINANCE PRIOR TO SECOND READING, AND THE SCHEDULING OF THE PUBLIC HEARING. SO, I WOULD JUST SAY THAT, THIS TENSION I GUESS I WILL ACKNOWLEDGE, WILL BE -- WILL BE DAYLIGHTED IN THE MATERIALS THAT GOES TO CITY COUNCIL, AND CITY COUNCIL WILL BE AWARE OF THAT. GIVING THEM THE ABILITY, TO FOLLOW THE TYPICAL PROCEDURES AND COURSE THAT WE DO FOR UDC ORDINANCES OR IF THEY WANT TO HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE
01:34:17.152: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT: OKAY. SOUNDS GOOD. COMMISSIONER DISCH, THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT THE ADUS PART 2. I LOVE THAT YOU'RE EXPLORING THAT. I ALSO -- ONE OF THE CALLERS MENTIONED I THOUGHT THIS IDEA WAS INTRIGUING, I DON'T THINK THIS IS OUR PURVIEW BUT IF THERE ARE LOAN PRAPROGRAMS THAT ENABLE PEOPLE TO BUILD THEM -- TO BUILD THEM, I THINK, YOU KNOW, IF THERE WERE PARTNERS THAT, WE CAN BRING IN TO THAT CONVERSATION, YOU KNOW, TO HELP HOMEOWNERS THAT MIGHT NOT HAVE THE RIGHT FINANCING MECHANISMS, YOU KNOW, MAYBE THAT COULD BE PART OF THAT EXPLORATION AS WELL. I AM NOT MAKING A MOTION, BUT I WOULD -- I WOULD ALSO BE IN FAVOR OF INCREASING THE SETBACKS, 5 FEET, FEELS A LITTLE BIT MORE COMFORTABLE TO ME. BUT OTHER THAN THAT, I AM ALSO IN SUPPORT OF THIS, AS IS. YOU KNOW, I -- I KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF CONCERNS, PARTICULARLY ABOUT THE OWNER OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENT. I MEAN, I THINK THE FACT IS, YOU KNOW, BEEN TRYING TO PUSH THIS THROUGH AND IS THIS THE RIGHT THING TO DO? THERE ARE A LOT OF CRISES THAT WE'RE FACING SIMULTANEOUSLY RIGHT NOW AND SOMETHING HAS TO CHANGE. WE CANNOT KEEP BUILDING AND PLANNING AND DEVELOPING OUR CITIES THE WAY WE HAVE BEEN DOING. WE HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS, NOT ONLY IN ANN ARBOR, BUT ACROSS THE COUNTRY. WE HAVE A CLIMATE CRISIS, WE HAVE TO DO WERT PROMOTING NONMOTORIZED TRANSIT, MAKING SURE PEOPLE CAN LIVE MORE AFFORDABLY CLOSER TO THEIR JOBS WE HAVE A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS BOTH IN TERMS OF -- CHRONIC DISEASE RATES INCREASING DUE TO HOW OUR CITIES ARE DESIGNED AND, OF COURSE, CONCURRENTLY THIS INFECTIOUS DISEASE CRISIS, THERE ARE A LOT -- THERE ARE A LOT OF ARGUMENTS FOR CHANGING THE WAYS THAT OUR CITIES ARE DESIGNED, AND DEVELOPED, IN ORDER TO JUST OVERALL IMPROVE PUBLIC HEALTH AND OVERALL IMPROVE THE CLIMATE, I AM VERY SUPPORTIVE TO THESE CHANGES THAT MIGHT FEEL AGGRESSIVE. ACROSS THE BOARD. I DON'T THINK -- NOT EVERYBODY IS GOING TO BE COMFORTABLE WITH THESE THINGS BUT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE BIGGER PICTURE, ADUS ARE NOT GOING TO SOLVE OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS BUT IT'S A PIECE OF THE SOLUTION, THERE IS NO SILVER BULLET. THOUGH, THERE ARE OTHER THINGS WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT AND CHANGING TO INCREASE, THE OVERALL HOUSING STOCK. VARIOUS PRICE POINTS, YES, AND WE SHOULD LOOK AT THOSE NEXT, I THINK.  YOU KNOW, EXPANDING NEIGHBORHOODS THAT ALLOW DUPLEXES I THINK IS A GREAT THING TO LOOK AT. THIS DOESN'T HAVE TO BE EITHER/OR. SO I THINK THAT PASSING THIS, AS IS, AND REDUCING AND RELAXING THE RESTRICTIONS TO SEE WHAT ELSE WE CAN GET IN THIS COMMUNITY, WE CAN'T STAY SILENT. I THINK THAT'S ALL I HAVE FOR NOW.
01:37:04.619: >> COMMISSIONER?
01:37:05.353: >> COMMISSIONER:  THANK YOU, YEAH, I JUST WANT TO MAYBE SECOND THOSE COMMENTS FROM COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT, I THINK THOSE ARE REALLY IMPORTANT POINTS AND SO THANK YOU FOR MAKING THEM, AND ALSO, COMMISSIONER DISCH, I'LL BE THINKING ABOUT WAYS THE CITY CAN HELP PEOPLE FINANCE, AND, ACTUALLY, ACHIEVE, THE DESIRE TO BUILD AN ADU. I WANTED -- I GUESS, SINCE WE ONLY HAVE, THIS, ON OUR AGENDA THIS EVENING, WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME, AND SO, I -- I WANTED TO TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE COMMUNICATIONS, AND COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE DURING THE PUBLIC HEARING. I THINK WE HEARD A NUMBER OF TIMES QUESTIONS AROUND THE MOTIVATION OF THIS BODY, TO REVISE THE ORDINANCE. AND I WANTED TO SAY A COUPLE OF THINGS IN RESPONSE TO THAT. SO, ONE IS THAT, I DON'T -- IN MY OPINION, WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW IS NOT ESTABLISHING A MANDATE FOR ADUS IN ANN ARBOR. THAT HAPPENED IN 2016. WHEN THE CITY CHANGED THE ORDINANCE TO ALLOW THEM. WHAT I SEE OUR ROLE RIGHT NOW AS BEING IS BASICALLY, FULFILLING THAT DESIRE, WHICH WAS EXPRESSED IN 2016 BY REMOVING OBSTACLES. I CLEAR THE ORDINANCE AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN IS NOT ALLOWING FOR ADUS TO BE BUILT IN ANN ARBOR AND IF THAT IS THE GOAL, WHICH ACCORDING TO THE ORDINANCE, IT IS, YOU KNOW, OR ACCORDING TO THE VOTING OF THE BODIES THIS BODY AND THE CITY COUNCIL IN 2016, THEN, I THINK, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE, ARE INTERESTED IN DOING, IS, MAKING THAT GOAL A REALITY. AND SO, WE -- I THINK HAVE SPENT A LOT OF TIME TALKING ABOUT WHAT THOSE VARIOUS OBSTACLES ARE. AND SOME OF THEM ARE FINANCIAL, AND, I DON'T KNOW THAT, YOU KNOW, WE'RE GOING TO SOLVE THAT THIS EVENING. BUT A LOT OF THEM ARE ABOUT THE WAY IN WHICH THE ORDINANCE RESTRICTS THE CONSTRUCTION OF CERTAIN KINDS OF ADUS ON CERTAIN KINDS OF LOTS. AND, I SUPPORT OUR WORK TOWARDS REMOVING THOSE OBSTACLES, AS FAR AS I UNDERSTAND IT, THIS PROCESS HAS NOT BEEN MORE RUSHED, OR RAMMED THROUGH, OR CIRCUMVENTING THE PROCESS BY WHICH ALL ORDINANCE REVISIONS GO THROUGH, WHICH IS TO SAY THAT IT'S BEEN DISCUSSED IN ORDINANCE REVISIONS COMMITTEE, WORKING SESSION, AND HAS HAD PUBLIC HEARINGS. AND KIND OF, STANDARD NOTIFICATION, I MEAN, I THINK MR. LEONARD IS DESCRIBING, ACTUALLY, INCREASED NOTIFICATION, AND PUBLICITY AROUND THIS ORDINANCE CHANGE. AND SO... ACTUALLY, I'LL PAUSE HERE WITH A QUESTION. MAYBE, MR. LEONARD -- WAS THERE A POSTCARD SENT OUT IN 2016?
01:39:44.178: >> NO.
01:39:44.479: >> COMMISSIONER:  NO, SO, I MEAN, IN MY MIND THAT FEELS LIKE A MUCH MORE RADICAL, THAT WAS THE RADICAL NEWS, THIS IS NOT THAT RADICAL COMPARED TO THAT. AND I THINK MR. CHAN PROVIDED EVIDENCE, YOU KNOW, DATA I SHOULD SAY, SORRY, KIND OF REVEALING THE NUMBER OF LOT THAT WOULD NOW BE ELIGIBLE, BY ZONING, ACCORDING TO THESE CHANGES AND IT'S THE MINORY. SO, E OTHER THING THAT I -- TH I HRD IN T COMMENTS AND VIA E-MAIL BUT ALSO, FROMHE CALLERS, IS, QUESTIO ABOUT THE WHY. AND, MAYBE, QUESTIOAROUND LIKE, YBE BEI UNCLEAR ABOUT WHY, IFHE GOALS TONCREASE THE COTRUCTION OF ADU IN ANN ARBOR, WHAT'S A UDABLE I WANT TO, ACTUAL, IF Y'LL BEAR WIT MEEAD HE FM THE RP A MODEL, ORDINANCE, BECAUSE, I THINK THEY DO A REALLY GOOD JOB BETTER THAN I WOULD BE ABLE TO, OFF THE CUFF, ARTICULATING, THE BENEFITS OF ADUS. AND I THINK THESE REALLY APPLY TO OUR COMMUNITY. SO ONE, THE INCREASE THE SUPPLY OF MORE AFFORDABLE TYPE OF HOUSING THAT DOES NOT REQUIRE GOVERNMENT SUBSIDY. SO WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE FACT THAT THEY MAY BE MARKET RATE RENTALS, THEY MAY NOT BE RENTALS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE AT 40% OR 60% OR EVEN 80%, AMI, BUT AS COMMISSIONER CLARK WAS DESCRIBING, THE KIND OF WAY IN WHICH AFFORDABLE HOUSING -- THE WAY IN WHICH HOUSING BECOMES MORE AFFORDABLE IN A COMMUNITY, IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THESE UNITS THEMSELVES, HAVE TO BE AFFORDABLE UNITS. INCREASING THE SUPPLY OF UNITS IN GENERAL, THESE WILL BRING RATES DOWN, OR AT LEAST SLOW THEIR RISE. TWO, THEY SAY, ADUS WILL HELP OLDER HOMEOWNERS, SINGLE PARENTS, YOUNG HOME BUYERS AND RENTERS, SEEKING A WIDER RANGE OF HOMES, PRICES RENTS AND LOCATIONS SO WE'VE ALSO TALKED ABOUT JUST PROVIDING MORE POSSIBLE PLACES TO LIVE IN THESE NEIGHBORHOODS. RENTAL UNITS, WHERE THERE WEREN'T RENTAL UNITS, SMALLER UNITS WHERE THERE WEREN'T SMALLER UNITS AND IN PARTICULAR HERE, I WANT TO THINK FOR A MINUTE ABOUT THE OLDER HOMEOWNER BECAUSE THERE WAS A CALLER THAT SAID ONLY RICH PEOPLE CAN BUILD ADUS. I THINK ACTUALLY RIGHT NOW THE EASIEST WAY TO FINANCE AN ADU IS THROUGH EQUITY IN YOUR HOME AND THE PEOPLE MOST LIKELY TO HAVE EQUITY IN YOUR HOME ARE OLDER HOMEOWNERS, SO IT DOESN'T -- WEALTH DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE CASH RICH. IT MIGHT MEAN YOU ACTUALLY HAVE AN AS/* ASSET YOU CAN ACTUALLY USE TO BE ABLE TO AGE IN PLACE, CAPITALIZE ON THE ASSET THAT YOU HAVE, BUILD UP OVER YOUR LIFETIME. BE ABLE TO AGE IN PLA CAPITALIZE ON THE ASSET THAT YOU HAVE, BUILD UP OVER YOUR LIFETIME. THREE, INCREASE HOUSING DIVERSITY AND SUPPLY PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES TO REDUCE SEGREGATION OF PEOPLE AND RACE, INCOME RESULTED FROM DECADES OF EXCLUSIONARY. PROVIDE HOMEOWNERS WITH RISING INCOME TO MEET RISING HOMEOWNERSHIP LAW, CREATE AN CONVENIENT ARRANGEMENT TO PROVIDE THOSE TO PROVIDE CARE, AND SUPPORT FOR SOMEONE WITH SEMIINDEPENDENT LIVING COMMUNITY WITHOUT THE LATTER LEAVING HIS OR HER COMMUNITY, EXTENDED FAMILY ALSO AGING IN PLACE, AND I THINK FROM A DIFFERENT REPORT WE RECEIVED BY THE URBAN LAND INSTITUTE THEY CITED THAT 46% OF THE ADUS THAT THEY STUDIED ARE RENTED BY SOMEONE WITH AN ARMS LENGTH RELATIONSHIP TO THE HOMEOWNER, SO WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT A LARGE NUMBER OF THESE BEING, FRIENDS AND FAMILY, 6, PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR INCREASED SECURITY, HOME CARE AND COMPANIONSHIP FOR OLDER AND OTHER HOMEOWNERS SO NEIGHBORS WHO ARE LOOKING OUT FOR NEIGHBORS, 7, REDUCING BURDENS ON TAXPAYERS WHILE ENHANCING LOCAL PROPERTY TAX BASE BY PROVIDING A COST-EFFECTIVE MEANS OF ACCOMMODATING DEVELOPMENT WITHOUT THE COST OF BUILDING OPERATING AND MAINTAINING INFRASTRUCTURE. I MEAN, I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FROM A KIND OF CIVIC STANDPOINT. WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT INCREASING DENSITY, YOU KNOW, IN THIS KIND OF ACUPUNCTUREAL WAY, WHERE WORKING DENSITY INTO THE NEIGHBORHOODS THAT ALREADY HAVE THIS INFRASTRUCTURE. SUSTAINED. 8 PROMOTING MORE COMPACT URBAN AND SUBURBAN GROWTH SO THIS IS WHAT COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT WAS JUST DESCRIBING ABOUT NEW PATTERNS OF THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT THAT WE JUST NEED TO ADOPT IN ORDER TO COMBAT OTHER CRISES LIKE CLIMATE CHANGE. AND 9 -- ENHANCEING JOB OPPORTUNITIES FOR INDIVIDUALS BY PROVIDING HOUSING NEARER TO EMPLOYMENT CENTERS AND PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION, AND THAT'S ALSO SOMETHING THAT COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT COMMENTED ON, SO I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT I THINK THOSE GOALS ARE VERY, VERY IMPORTANT, AND I THINK THAT THEY OVERLAP WITH THE GENERAL GOALS OF OUR COMMUNITY RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF SUSTAINABILITY, AFFORDABILITY, AND -- AND -- TRYING TO -- AND ANTIRACIST WORK, LET'S SAY, TO HAVE A MORE INCLUSIVE COMMUNITY. AND SO, FOR ME, THIS IS JUST ONE PART, IT'S NOT THE WHOLE PICTURE, BUT IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF MEETING THOSE GOALS. AND, YES, I THINK IT'S A MULTIPRONG, YOU KNOW -- A MULTIPRONG APPROACH. IT'S NOT AN EITHER OR, SO I DON'T THINK THIS COMES AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHER APPROACHES, OTHER APPROACHES, TO BRINGING MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING INTO THE COMMUNITY, AND I THINK, AS A BODY, WE -- EXPRESSED I THINK A SHARED COMMITMENT TO THAT. AND THEN MAYBE THE LAST THING I WANTED TO TOUCH ON IS JUST -- AND I SAID THIS AT THE LAST TIME WE MET, AND TALKED ABOUT THIS BUT IN MY MIND THE OWNER OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENT REALLY DOES PUT -- IT -- IT BASICALLY -- UM... PRODUCES A HIERARCHY, OR KIND OF CLASS OF HOUSING, THAT IS LOWER, THAN OTHER FORMS OF HOUSING, IT SAYS THAT OWNER OCCUPIED HOUSING IS SOMEHOW MORE VALUABLE OR BETTER THAN RENTER OCCUPIED HOUSING OR IT SAYS THAT PRIMARY HOMES ARE BETTER THAN ADUS. AND I THINK IF WHAT WE'RE DOING, IS, AGREEING ADUS ARE KIND OF EQUAL AND IMPORTANT TO HOUSING THEN THEY SHOULDN'T BE REGULATED DIFFERENT THAN THE SINGLE-FAMILY HOME, AND SO IF THERE'S NOT AN OWNER OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENT FOR A HOME E WHICH I THINK COMMISSIONER DISCH -- CALLED OUT THAT I CAN BUY A HOME AND RENT IT, RIGHT? THEN I THINK THAT THE SAME KIND OF RULES SHOULD APPLY, TO ADUS. AND SO, FOR THOSE REASONS, I'M IN SUPPORT OF THE REVISIONS THAT ARE -- BEFORE US TONIGHT AND I ALSO WOULD SUPPORT AN AMENDMENT TO INCREASE THE 3 FOOT SETBACK TO 5 FEET. THANKS.
01:46:22.610: >> COMMISSIONER MILLSTEIN.
01:46:26.180: >> COMMISSIONER:  THANK YOU, SO, I AM -- I CONCUR WITH THE COMMENTS I'VE HEARD SO FAR. I AM SUPPORTIVE OF THIS -- OF THESE AMENDMENTS, SOMETHING THAT I'VE HEARD, AND SOMETHING THAT WE'VE SEEN IN OUR COMMUNICATION FROM CONCERNED RESIDENTS, IS, THAT, THIS ALLOWS FOR INVESTORS TO BUY UP PROPERTIES AND BUILD, YOU KNOW, SECOND UNITS PRETTY MUCH, ON -- ON THEIR PROPERTY. SO, I DIDN'T -- I DID SOME MATH AND I TALKED TO ONE CONTRACTOR, UNFORTUNATELY I WASN'T AUDIBLE  ABLE TO REACH OUT TO MORE THAN ONE, BUT THE REALITY IS THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT'S REQUIRED TO BUILD A FOR EXAMPLE A GARAGE, WITH A UNIT UP ABOVE, IS PRETTY SIGNIFICANT. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT, YOU KNOW, TWO TO 300,000 DOLLARS IS THE BALLPARK THAT I RECEIVED DEPENDING ON HOW NICE THAT IS AND THE SQUARE FOOTAGE THAT IT ADDS, IN REGARD TO SQUARE FOOTAGE OF THE UNIT, ESPECIALLY IF IT'S OVER A GARAGE, ISN'T ALL THAT GREAT. LET'S JUST SAY IT'S 450 TO 650 SQUARE FEET. AND ONE BEDROOM UNIT, YOU KNOW, LOOKING AT, THE AMOUNT OF MONEY, THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO GET AND RENT, ON A MONTHLY BASIS AND ULTIMATELY ON A YEARLY BASIS, THE NUMBERS THAT I RAN, IS THE NUMBERS I USUALLY LOOK AT WITH -- WHEN I'M WORKING WITH INVESTOR CLIENTS, AND WHAT WE USUALLY LOOK AT IS GROSS RENT MULTIPLIERS, SO, THE SALE PRICE OF THE PROPERTY, DIVIDED BY THE YEARLY GROSS RENTS EQUALS A GROSS RENT MULTIPLIER RATE. THAT RATE, FOR MOST INVESTMENT PROPERTIES IN THE ANN ARBOR AREA, IS RIGHT AROUND, YOU KNOW, LET'S JUST SAY 11 TO 12 TIMES, THE YEARLY RENT. WHEN I DID THE NUMBERS, BASED ON HOW MUCH IT WOULD COST TO BUILD AN ADU, AND, HOW MUCH RENT IT'S RECEIVING, THE NUMBERS WERE ANYWHERE FROM 14, 15, TO 16 TIMES THE RENT, SO THE AN INVESTOR IS GOING TO COME IN, BUY A PROPERTY AND INVEST THAT MUCH MORE TO NOT MAKE ALL THAT MUCH MONEY, DOESN'T MAKE A WHOLE LOT OF SENSE, ULTIMATELY THEY CAN TAKE THE ADDITIONAL MONEY AND BUY UP ADDITIONAL PROPERTY, IF THEY'RE TRULY ARE IN THE BUSINESS OF TRYING TO MAKE INCOME FROM INVESTMENT PROPERTIES, THAT ARGUMENT DOESN'T FLY WITH ME THAT ALL OF A SUDDEN INVESTORS ARE GOING TO BUY UP PROPERTIES AND BUILD ADUS. AND RENT THEM OUT. SO, THAT'S JUST ONE ITEM THAT I WANT TO POINT OUT. OVERALL, I AM SUPPORTIVE OF THESE AMENDMENTS, AND, FURTHER, I WOULD ALSO BE SUPPORTIVE OVER INCREASING THE SETBACK TO 5 FEET. SO WHEN THE TIME COMES I'M HAPPY TO MAKE THAT MOTION OR SUPPORT THAT MOTION, THANK YOU.
01:49:19.119: >> LIKE SOMEONE ELSE SAID EARLIER, MAYBE IT WAS COMMISSIONER DISCH, I REALLY LIKE THAT, THE CHAIR OFTEN GOES TOWARDS THE END, BECAUSE YOU HAVE ALL SAID, THE THINGS THAT WERE ON MY LIST, MUCH MORE ELOQUENTLY.
01:49:31.832: >> SARAH MILLS, CHAIR:  I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF THINGS, AND THIS IS NOT INTENDED TO BE CORRECTIONS TO THINGS, EARLIER, BUT JUST TO HIGHLIGHT, TO PUT IT IN CONTEXT A LITTLE BIT. A COUPLE OF TIMES IT WAS TALKED ABOUT AS, YOU KNOW, COMMISSIONER DISCH THINKING ABOUT ADU 2.0, RIGHT? AND THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT I THINK, CAME UP, OR THAT HAD BEEN IN DISCUSSION BEFORE THAT'S HELPFUL. THIS IS ADU 2.0, LIKE, THIS IS NOT ADU 1.0. RIGHT? AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT, I THINK, THE COMMISSIONER REALLY POINTED OUT. LIKE, THE BIG DECISION, THAT OPENED UP ADUS, IN A BIGGER WAY, IN THE SINGLE-FAMILY DISTRICTS, HAPPENED IN 2016. SO WHEN I THINK ABOUT WHAT THE BIGGEST CHANGES ARE, TO THE ORDINANCE BEFORE US TODAY, IN TERMS OF THOSE DISTRICTS, LIKE, IT'S -- IT'S, ACTUALLY, ADDING IT TO THE MULTIFAMILY DISTRICTS, WHICH, WAS TALKED ABOUT THEN, THAT'S NOT A COMMON -- A BIG CONCERN, THAT WE'VE HEARD HERE. RIGHT? SO I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S A -- A HUGE CRDRASTIC CHANGE, A, AGAIN, KIND OF POINTING TO COMMISSIONER -- OR TO MR. CHANG'S NUMBERS, THERE'S NOT TONS OF SINGLE-FAMILY RESIDENCES, IN THOSE MULTIUNIT DISTRICTS ANYWAY. OR THE MULTIFAMILY DISTRICTS SO I DON'T THINK THAT'S A BIG CHANGE. PARKING, ACTUALLY, IS NOT A BIG CHANGE, BECAUSE WE'RE NOT, LIKE, -- BECAUSE, THE CAVEAT THAT YOU HAD TO BE WITHIN A QUARTER MILE OF A BUS STOP -- IF YOU WERE WITHIN A QUARTER MILE OF A BUS STOP, YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO PROVIDE OFF-STREET PARKING? THERE'S NOT VERY MANY PROPERTIES AS MR. CHANG SAID, THAT ARE NOT WITHIN A QUARTER MILE OF A BUS STOP. SO THAT IS REALLY NOT A BIG CHANGE. IT'S SHOWING UP ON THE TABLE AS A CHANGE. BUT THAT'S REALLY NOT A BIG CHANGE. THE SETBACKS, ACTUALLY, ARE NOT A BIG CHANGE. WE ALLOWED BEFORE, GARAGES, OR OTHER EXISTING STRUCTURES, THAT WERE IN EXISTENCE AT THE TIME BUT THERE WAS ACTUALLY, A WINDOW, WHERE PEOPLE COULD BUILD A GARAGE, QUICKLY. THEY COULD BUILD A NEW ACCESSORY STRUCTURE, AND, ALLOW IT TO, YOU KNOW, -- AND -- AND HAVE IT BE FEASIBLE FOR AN ADU; THAT WAS 3 FEET OFF THE PROPERTY BENE, SO THAT'S ACTUALLY NOT THE BIGGEST CHANGE, THE LOT SIZE IN MY MIND IS NOT A HUGE CNGE JUST BECAE IT APPLIES TO VERY FEW PROPERTIES, ANDHERE'S OTHER THE LOT COVERAGE REQUIREMENT, MUCH OF YOUR REAR SETBACK, C BE CERED, SO, IN MY MIND, THE BIGGEST OCCUPANCY,HAT'S THE BIGGEST -- THE POINTSHAT COMMISSIOR NK, DIH, AND CMISSIONER LLSTEIDE, AUT WHEER THAT, TUALLY, MAKES, LIKE, WHETHER THAT  A BIG DEAL, ALSO THE OTHER COMMISSIONERS, I MEAN, AS SOME OF YOU WERE TALKING I JUST, LIKE, NOTED DOWN YOUR NAMES! LIKE, I -- THAT WAS THE THING THAT I -- THOSE WHO ARE ON ORC KNOW, LIKE, THAT WAS -- WHERE I WAS ON, THE FENCE, AND I -- AND I FEEL MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE WITH THAT NOW. BECAUSE I THINK THAT, THE ROLE OF INVESTORS IN OUR COMMUNITY, LIKE, THIS IS NOT CHANGING THAT. AT ALL. AND SO, I DON'T SEE THIS, AS A DRASTIC CHANGE. AND I -- I KNOW AND FOR THAT MATTER, THIS IS THE -- THE -- THE EVOLUTION OF OUR POLICIES AND THE THINGS WE'RE SUPPOSED TO DO. HONESTLY BACK IN 2016, WHERE THIS IS COMING FROM IS BACK IN 2016, WE SAID LET'S DO THIS AND LET'S REVISIT IT IN A COUPLE OF YEARS TO SEE IF IT'S WORKING, LIKE, WE DID -- WE ATTEMPTED TO DO THAT. IN THE INTERIM. AND, THIS BODY THOUGHT THAT, LIKE, THERE WERE CHANGES THAT COULD BE MADE AND THAT COUNCIL DIDN'T THINK IT AT THAT TIME, WE'RE REVISITING, WE SAID IN 2016 WE WOULD DO THAT. SO I REALLY DON'T SEE THIS, AS A DRASTIC CHANGE. AND -- ANY OF THESE THINGS, AS -- AS, YOU KNOW, HUGELY CHANGING THE IMPLICATIONS OF -- OF A LOT OF PEOPLE. YOU KNOW, WHAT COULD HAPPEN IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS. SO... TO THAT EXTENT, LIKE, I AM -- I AM SUPPORTIVE OF THIS, I'M, ACTUALLY, -- I -- GIVEN -- I WOULD NOT BE -- I'M FINE PASSING THIS, WITHOUT THE CHANGES TO THE SETBACK DISTANCE, I THINK THAT THAT COMPLICATES THINGS FOR THOSE THAT ACTUALLY MAY HAVE BEEN BUILT IN THE INTERIM, THAT ARE THERE; AND, LIKE, I -- I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S NECESSARY, IN 2016, WE SAID THAT IF YOU HAD A GARAGE 3 FOOT FROM THE PROPERTY LINE OR YOU COULD BUILD ONE IN THE NEXT SIX MONTHS, LIKE, YOU COULD HAVE AN ADU IN IT, IF YOU WERE IN THOSE COUPLE OF DISTRICTS AND I JUST DON'T -- SO THAT WAS, YOU KNOW, OKAY, BACK THEN. I'M NOT SURE WE NEED TO REVISIT THAT NOW. FROM OUR DISCUSSION, SOME OF THE THINGS THAT I -- YOU KNOW, THE -- A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT I NOTED AND BROUGHT -- AS -- OTHER COMMISSIONERS BROUGHT THIS UP IS ABOUT PLANNING STAFF, AND NOT SO MUCH FOR ENFORCEMENT, BUT THE DEMANDS ON PLANNING STAFF, FOR EXPLAINING, AND SO, COMMISSIONER DISCH, ONE OF THE THINGS IS MAKING IT EASIER, RIGHT? THANK YOU, STAFF FOR PUTTING TOGETHER THE FAQS, BUT, YOU KNOW, TEMPLATES ABOUT WHAT THIS COULD LOOK LIKE, AND HOW IT COULD BE REALIZED. IT'S NOT NECESSARILY PLANNING STUFF, BUT IT'S GOING TO TAKE SOME WORK OFF THEIR PLATE, NOT WORK YOU NEED TO DO, MAYBE, BUT I THINK IT COULD TAKE OFF WORK OFF YOUR PLATE. I THINK, TOO, WHAT GETS BROUGHT UP A LOT IS THE MASTER PLAN, AND THERE ARE ELEMENTS OF THE MASTER PLAN THAT I THINK WE SHOULD REVISIT, I DON'T THINK THAT THIS ONE IS ONE THAT NECESSARILY NEEDS TO BE REVISITED; THAT THE IDEA OF ADUS WITHIN THE MASTER PLAN, IS, ACTUALLY, SOME OF THE NEWER ELEMENTS, WE HAVE OLDER ELEMENTS OF THE MASTER PLAN THAT I WOULD LOVE TO REVISIT. IT'S -- IF THERE WERE STAFF AND BUDGET FOR THAT. BUT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT, A COUPLE OF TIMES, AND, LIKE, WE'RE MOVING ON. THIS IS -- THIS IS IMPLEMENTING PAST THINGS, THAT HAVEN'T MADE IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH, IN MY MIND; SO, I'M SUPPORTIVE OF THIS ORDINANCE REVISION AS IS. AND REALLY WANT TO THANK, ALL OF THE COMMISSIONERS' THOUGHTFUL DESTR SCSION ABOUT IT. FOLX CALLING IN TO, YOU KNOW, -- WITH CONCERNS, OR ALSO, WITH SUPPORT FOR THIS, HAS HELPED ME KIND OF CLARIFY, LIKE, WHERE THERE ARE DIFFERENCESND HONESTLY THAT TABLE, THAT YOU PUT TOGETHER, MR. CHANG, REALLY HELPED, YOU KNOW, WHERE -- HOW, THERE ARE DIFFERENCES, I THINK THAT WAS REALLY HELPFUL FOR ME. SO I APPRECIATE THAT. OTHER -- COMMISSIONER? AND THEN COMMISSIONER DISCH.
01:56:37.557: >> COMMISSIONER:  I JUST WANTED TO MAKE ONE MORE COMMENT ABOUT THE SETBACK. I THINK YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT, COMMISSIONER MILLS, AND ONE MAYBE DETAIL TO NOTE IS THAT, IN ORDER TO BUILD THREE FEET FROM THE SETBACK, YOU HAVE TO CONSTRUCT WITH FIRE-RATED WALLS, BECAUSE OF LIFE SAFETY CODE, AND, I FEEL THAT MOST PEOPLE, WOULD PROBABLY PREFER TO JUST MOVE THE BUILDING TO THE 5-FOOT LIMIT. IT'S HARD FOR ME, TO IMAGINE, A SCENARIO, WHERE THE DESIRE TO BE -- TO HAVE THOSE EXTRA 2 FEET, WOULD CAUSE YOU TO PAY THE EXTRA COST OF THE FIRE-RATED CONSTRUCTION, SO IT FEELS -- IT FEELS LIKE A SMALL DETAIL, I THINK, AT THIS POINT. THANKS
01:57:21.335: >> COMMISSIONER DISCH?
01:57:25.038: >> COMMISSIONER DISCH:  I HAVE ONE THOUGHT ABOUT PARKING AND I'M HOPING YOU-ALL JUST LAUGH IN MY FACE, BUT THE PREVIOUS ORDINANCE HAD A REQUIREMENT ABOUT PARKING THAT WAS MOOT, BECAUSE EVERY -- BASICALLY EVERY PLACE IN ANN ARBOR IS WITHIN A QUARTER OF A MILE OF A BUS STOP. BUT IT DID HAVE A REQUIREMENT ABOUT PARKING SO THAT IF, IN SOME FUTURE TIME, PEOPLE HAVE COME TO DECIDE THAT THEY WANT TO NOT HAVE ADUS BUILT, AND THEY DECIDE, I KNOW, WE'RE GOING TO SLAP A REALLY RESTRICTIVE PARKING REQUIREMENT, SO THAT THEY CAN'T BE BUILT, IF WE'VE TAKEN OUT OUR PARKING REQUIREMENT AND THEY JUST GET TO PUT IT IN, THEY GET TO SAY THIS ORDINANCE DIDN'T EVEN THINK ABOUT PARKING REQUIREMENT, HOW DUMB, WE'RE GOING TO REQUIRE X NUMBER OF PARKING SPACES AND NOW NO ADUS WILLIAM BUILT. IF IF THE PARK, REQUIREMENT IS MOOT, MET IN, IT'S OBVIOUS IT'S A STRICTER PARKING REQUIREMENT BEING IMPOSED SO IT'S CLEAR, TO EVERYONE WHAT'S HAPPENING, I REALIZE THAT I AM PLAYING CHESS, AND, EXHIBITING PARANOIA. BUT I WAS DOING SOME READING ABOUT, HOW PLACES, HAVE -- LEGALIZED AND THEN MADE UNAIDABLE ADUS AND THAT WAS ONE WAY IN WHICH THEY DO IT. SO I DON'T REALLY THINK THAT WE NEED TO BRING THE PARKING REQUIREMENT BACK IN, BUT I'M JUST THINKING ABOUT HOW, BY -- LEAVING IT SILENT, IT ISN'T -- IT WOULDN'T BE OBVIOUS THAT SOMEONE WAS USING THAT TACTIC, THAT SORT OF BAIT-AND-SWITCH TACTIC TO SAY, OF COURSE, ADUS ARE LEGAL, BUT UNFORTUNATELY NO ONE SEEMS TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE PARKING. YOU CAN ALL LAUGH NOW.
01:59:12.979: >> I'M NOT LAUGHING I'M GOING TO THE TEXT, TO SEE -- ARE WE REALLY SILENT ON PARKING ENTIRELY, AND/OR -- AND I WOULD POSE THAT TO STAFF ABOUT.
01:59:23.557: >> YEAH, SO. I GUESS I WANT TO GO BACK, TO A COUPLE -- SORT OF THE QUESTION THAT COMMISSIONER S., ASKED, PERHAPS AT THE SORT OF AFTER THE PUBLIC HEARING. THE ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT IS JUST THAT:  IT'S DEFINED AS AN ACCESSORY, TO A SINGLE-FAMILY DWELLING. WE ARE NOT PROVIDING ANY OCCUPANCY CAPACITY, THAT ISN'T ALREADY PROVIDED, AT THE PROPERTY, SO, FROM THAT LENS, I THINK THAT, PERHAPS, WE WERE ALREADY GOING DOWN A ROAD OF, ACTUALLY, REQUIRING MORE PARKING, FOR THE SAME CAPACITY, THAT, A -- THE COMPARABLY SITUATED, SAME PARCEL WOULD BE WITHOUT AN ADU. SAME -- SAME MAXIMUM OCCUPANCY, BUT WE WERE -- WE WERE -- THE CODE AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN TODAY, STATES THAT, IF YOU'RE REDISTRIBUTING THE SAME PEOPLE, IN THAT SAME PROPERTY, YOU HAVE TO PROVIDE MORE PARKING. AND, I GUESS I WOULD SAY THAT, THAT SEEMS -- MY PREMISE IS THAT'S A DIRECTION THAT THE PLANNING COMMISSION HAS ROUTINELY BEEN SORT OF, RE- -- PUSHING AGAINST, RECENTLY THAT WE IN FACT, SHOULD NOT BE PUSHING FOR MORE PARKING, AND THIS -- THIS -- AND, YOU KNOW, RIGHT NOW, THIS ORDINANCE, SAYS THAT IF YOU -- YOU KNOW, TO AN EXTREME EXAMPLE:  FOUR UNRELATED PEOPLE CAN LIVE IN THIS HOUSE, WITH THE PARKING THAT'S PROVIDED. IF THE SAME FOUR PEOPLE LIVE IN THE HOUSE, WITH TWO OF THEM IN AN ADU, AND TWO IN THE MAIN HOUSE, THEN YOU NEED TO PROVIDE MORE PARKING. THAT -- I GUESS AT ITS CORE, THAT SEEMS, INCONSISTENT, WITH A LOT OF THE DISCUSSIONS THAT I'VE HEARD AT THE PLANNING COMMISSION. I APPRECIATE, COMMISSIONER DISCH'S SORT OF THOUGHTS THAT I -- I DON'T THINK IT HAS A LOT OF APPLICABILITY, BUT TO LEAVE IT IN, WOULD BE, MAINTAINING THAT STATEMENT THAT, THAT THE COMMISSION AND THE CITY THINK THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO ADD PARKING IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE.
02:01:34.187: >> AND THIS CAME UP AT ORC (LAUGHING) AND THAT'S WAS -- SOME OF THE DISCUSSION IN THE KIND OF -- BEFORE WE SAW IT THE LAST TIME AROUND, TWO WEEKS AGO, THAT WAS OUR DISCUSSION, WHICH WAS, WE'RE RETHINKING PARKING GENERALLY. AND THERE ARE LOTS -- WE HAVE TOMES OF MASTER PLANNING DOCUMENTS, THAT SUPPORT THE IDEA OF -- OF REDUCING THE REQUIREMENTS, AND -- YEAH, ON MY LIST ON THE PARKING,ISH I HAVE THE COMMISSIONER'S NAME WRITTEN DOWN BECAUSE YOU SAID --
02:02:07.287: >> I WOULD ALSO END IT WITH THE PARKING, YOU KNOW, THE PRINCIPAL STRUCTURE, IS REQUIRED TO HAVE ONE PARKING SPACE, YOU KNOW, PER OUR CODE FOR SINGLE-FAMILY, AND WE DON'T COUNT ANY TYPE OF STAFF PARKING, SO YOU MAY HAVE MORE PARKING NOW. YOU MAY SHOW THAT YOU ONLY HAVE THE MINIMUM OF ONE PARKING SPACE, BUT IF YOU HAVE A TWO CAR GARAGE YOU REALISTICALLY HAVE FOUR SPACES YOU'LL PARK BEHIND YOU'LL HAVE MORE THAN THE ONE MINIMUM THAT'S REQUIRED BUT WE'RE NOT COUNTING THE STACKED SPACES EITHER.
02:02:34.414: >> I WAS NOT CLEAR ON THIS, SO THIS IS EXCELLENT TO KNOW, IN FACT, WE NEED TO REMOVE THIS, BECAUSE WE WERE -- WE WERE SETTING A HIGHER BAR. WOULD IT MAKE SENSE, TO -- TO STATE IN AN AFFIRMATIVE WAY, THAT, WE'RE NOT GOING TO REGULATE THESE, IN A WAY THAT INCREASES, PARKING MINIMUMS? I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW, CAN YOU TIE FUTURE DECISION-MAKERS THAT WAY?
02:03:05.612: >> WELL, THE, YOU KNOW -- BY STRIKING IT, WE ARE NOT, BY STRIKING IT, IT HAS THE IMPACT OF.... THAT WE ARE STILL REGULATING PARKING BY SINGLE-FAMILY DWELLING UNIT. OR, THE SAME STANDARD WOULD APPLY TO A SINGLE-FAMILY DWELLING UNIT AND ITS ACCESSORY DWELLING. BUT LIKEWISE, AN ACCESRY -- A SINGLE-FAMILY DWELLING UT THAT HAS A HOME CUPATION, SAME PARKING REQUIREMENT. SO WE HAVE -- WE WOULD BE BY STRIKING IT, WE WOULD BE RELYING ON THA ONE SPE, PER HOMEIS OU -- OUR PECTATION; AND, WE PROVIDE LOT OF OPPTUNITY AND EXIBILITY, TO -- AS TOOW USED, THROUGACCESSORY US AND TH LI, WITHO SING IFOU DO THAT YOU HAVEO PRODE MORE PARKG. RESTATE AT. -- YOUOULD THE ADU SECTION, BUT I DON THINK 'S NECESSARY, TO DO IT. IT HPENS BY JT NOT ADDING- BY JTLINATING THIS ADTIONAL PARKING REQUIREMENT. BUT, YOU KNOW, I APPRECIATE THE THOUGHT, THAT I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE, AS IT IS, THIS DOESN'T COME IN TO PLAY, VERY OFTEN. BUT IT IS SAYING, THAT WE WANT MORE PARKING, IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, (A PAUSE),
02:04:36.002: >> IN THE PARKING SECTION, BECAUSE THAT'S NOT BEFORE US -- FOR SINGLE-FAMILY HOMES, DOES IT SAY SINGLE-FAMILY HOME, AND ITS ACCESSORY STRUCTURES AND USES? INCLUDING ADUS? I JUST WANT -- BECAUSE, I THINK TO COMMISSIONER DISCH'S POINT, LIKE, IT -- BEING EXPLICIT, MIGHT CLARIFY THINGS IF PEOPLE ARE UN- -- YOU KNOW, IF -- TO A -- TO A POTENTIAL ADU BUILDER, LIKE, IT IS AN AFFIRMATIVE, LIKE, NOPE YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUILD EXTRA PARKING. BUT I ALSO JUST WANT TO -- FOLLOW UP ON THAT. THE -- IT WAS SORT OF -- MAYBE IT WASN'T POSED AS A QUESTION, BUT I AM GOING TO POSE IT AS A QUESTION. ZONING IS A LIVING DOCUMENT, AND, THAT IT -- WHETHER WE STRIKE THIS, I MEAN, SOMEBODY COULD -- OR PUT IN THAT LANGUAGE, AFFIRMING THAT THERE'S NO PARKING REQUIRED, A FUTURE BODY, BASED ON -- -- AN UNEXPECTED PERVERSE IMPACT OF THIS ORDINANCE, COULD CHANGE IT. WE HOPE THEY DO. RIGHT? LIKE, IF IT'S NOT WORKING, LIKE, IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE LIVING. IT'S NOT WRITTEN IN STONE. BUT, ALSO, IF THERE IS A POLICY OVERALL, POLICY CHANGE THAT, LIKE, YOU KNOW, THEN -- OR DIRECTION FOR THE CITY, RIGHT? LIKE, THEN.... WE -- THEY'RE NOT BEHOLDEN TO THIS NECESSARILY, I APPRECIATE, LIKE, THINKING ABOUT HOW IT COULD BE, CHANGE, BUT I -- I ALSO WANT TO JUST MAKE CLEAR, LIKE, ZONING IS LIVING. LIKE... IT'S -- WE SHOULD BE REVISING -- REVISITING IT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS GETTING US ACHIEVING THE GOALS THAT WE HAVE ARTICULATED. THROUGH OUR PLANNING DOCUMENTS. SO... OR, IF IT'S NOT, TWEAKING IT TO MAKE IT BETTER TO DO THAT
02:06:28.381: >> AND TO YOUR -- TO YOUR QUESTION, IT -- THE PARKING STANDARD IS JUST SINGLE-FAMILY DWELLING, IT DOESN'T SAY SINGLE-FAMILY DWELLING AND ACCESSORY USES NOR IS THAT LANGUAGE APPLIED TO ANY OF OUR USES. IT IS BASED ON THE PRIMARY USE, SO, AGAIN, SINGLE-FAMILY DWELLING. IS -- A SINGLE-FAMILY DWELLING WITH AN ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT, IS A SINGLE-FAMILY DWELLING. A SINGLE-FAMILY DWELLING WITHOUT IT IS A SINGLE-FAMILY DWELLING WITH A HOME OCCUPATION IS A SINGLE-FAMILY DWELLING
02:06:58.578: >> OKAY. OF THE TWO POTENTIAL AMENDMENTS THAT WE -- THAT HAVE BEEN FLOATED I WOULD BE MORE IN FAVOR OF AN AMENDMENT THAT AFFIRMS, THAT NO ADDITIONAL PARKING IS REQUIRED. BUT I DON'T FEEL SUPERSTRONGLY THAT THAT HAS TO BE IN THIS. THE TWO AMENDMENTS SORRY TO BE CLEAR WERE ABOUT WHETHER PEOPLE WANT TO CHANGE THAT -- WHICH THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO SAID THAT MIGHT, BUT THERE WERE SOME PEOPLE WITH ARGUMENTS AGAINST IT. AND THIS IS, LIKE, AFFIRMING THAT NO ADDITIONAL PARKING IS REQUIRED. MR. LEONARD
02:07:37.750: >> ONE MORE THOUGHT:  THE UDC IS OUR CODE, SO, WHETHER SOMETHING IS IN THE CODE, THE STANDARD IS ESTABLISHED IN THE CODE AS WE WERE TALKING ABOUT ADU 3.0 OR 2.0 WHATEVER YOUR TERMINOLOGY IS. WE HAVE A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY TO JUST COMMUNICATE THOSE STANDARDS, AND AFFIRM, THAT NO PARKING IS REQUIRED, AS PART OF THAT. THE UDC, IN FACT, PROBABLY ISN'T THE BEST WAY TO JUST BROADLY COMMUNICATE EXPECTATIONS. IT SETS EXPECTATIONS. SO, I JUST WANT TO SAY, IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE AN EITHER-OR, IF THAT IS NOT AFFIRMED IN THE UDC IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE CAN'T LOOK FOR THOSE WAYS THAT WE INFORM THE PUBLIC ABOUT THE STANDARDS AND EXPECTATIONS FOR DEVELOPING ADU. THOSE THAT ARE DERIVED FROM THE UDC, AND WHETHER IT'S THE APPLICATION PROCESS, INFORMATION, FACT SHEETS, DIALOGUE, WE CAN CONVEY THAT, EVEN WHETHER -- WHETHER IT'S EXPLICIT IN THE LANGUAGE, OR IT'S JUST A RESULT, OF THE REQUIREMENTS. DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?
02:08:46.886: >> COMMISSIONER?
02:08:47.487: >> COMMISSIONER:  I HAVE A -- IT IS A CLARIFYING QUESTION ABOUT THE AREA LOT COVERAGE, AND SETBACKS. BECAUSE I THINK A LOT OF THIS COMES IN THAT ONE OF THE CHANGES IS ABOUT MINIMUM LOT SIZE AND THAT WE REMOVE THAT BUT WE HAVE THAT AREA LOT COVERAGE, THE AREA LOT COVERAGE IS THAT WITHIN THE BOUNDING BOX OF THE 3 FOOT OR 5 FOOT SETBACK? OR IS THAT ALL THE WAY TO THE PROPERTY LINE, WHEN TALKING ABOUT THAT PERCENTAGE?
02:09:18.217: >> WE TAKE IT THROUGH THE WHOLE REAR. NOT INCLUDING THE SETBACKS.
02:09:25.558: >> COMMISSIONER:  SO THEN --
02:09:28.227: >> PULL UP THAT GRAPHIC AND MAYBE WE CAN JUST CLARIFY THAT.
02:09:30.530: >> YEAH,.
02:09:31.664: >> YEAH.
02:09:31.964: >> THAT MAY BE COULD HELP. WHAT I'M ASKING ASK I GUESS, IS DOES IT HELP, WITH EXCEPTIONALLY SMALL LOTS TO SCHOOLTEACHER IT INTO THE SETBACK, TO MAKE BUILDING IT FEASIBLE, IN WHICH -- MIGHT SPEND MORE MONEY IN FIREPROOFING OR ARE THEY STILL -- THE INVERSE IS NOT SUPPORTED BY THE FOOTPRINT, DOES THAT MAKE SENSE, THE TRADE-OFFS OF LOOKING AT THOSE DIMENSIONAL STANDARDS.
02:09:57.824: >> IF I UNDERSTAND, IF YOU WERE EXCLUDING THE SET BACKS THIS WOULD BE A REAR YARD AND TAKE 35 -- APPROXIMATELY A THIRD OF IT IS WHAT YOU COULD USE, AS FAR AS, YOUR DETACHED ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT.
02:10:14.006: >> AND THAT'S ALL -- THAT REAR YARD SET BACK ALL THE WAY TO THE PROPERTY LINE SO THAT 5 FEET, IS -- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE SIDE YARD IN ANY CASE, OR SITTING, IN THE REAR -- THE SIDE OF THE REAR YARD IS ONE OTHER WAY TO LOOK AT IT.
02:10:32.391: >> NOW NOT TO CONFUSE IT A WHOLE LOT, I HAVE SEEN AS PEOPLE HAVE SUBMITTED FOR GARAGES, THIS IS -- THIS IS YOUR REAR YARD, NO MORE THAN 35% OF IT. IF THIS WERE A DEEPER LOT AND THEY HAPPEN TO BUILD A ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT AND USE SOME OF THE AREA IN THE WHITE HERE THAT'S PRINCIPAL, WE DON'T COUNT THAT SO THEY COULD MAKE IT MORE THAN 35%, BUT IT WOULDN'T BE MORE THAN 35% OF THE REAR YARD. THEY COULD TAKE UP SOME OF THIS, IF THIS HAPPENED TO BE A LITTLE DEEPER LOT, THEY COULD TAKE UP MORE AREA AND WE WOULDN'T COUNT IT AGAINST THE 35%.
02:11:05.024: >> YEAH.
02:11:06.125: >> THE 5 -- 3 OR 5 FOOT SETBACK DOESN'T CHANGE THE LOT COVERAGE, IT'S JUST WHERE -- IT WOULD JUST RESTRICT WHERE IN THAT RECTANGLE YOU COULD LOCATE IT.
02:11:17.937: >> YEAH. OKAY. YEAH, THOSE ARE KIND OF THE THINGS I JUST WANT TO LIKE CLARIFY. AS WE TALK ABOUT IT, AS AN OPEN ENDED THING, DOES IT REALLY MAKE MUCH CHANGE, IN ONE WAY OR THE OTHER? YOU KNOW, I THINK SOME OF THE PUBLIC COMMENT IS -- THE CONCERN OF IT, RIGHT AGAINST THE EDGE IS TWO FEET A BIG DIFFERENCE? AND HOW I AM REVIEWING IT, I UNDERSTAND THE KIND OF INCONSISTENCY OF, LIKE, 1.0 AND 2.0 WOULD CHANGE IT FROM 3 TO 5 FEET. THE ALTERNATIVE, IS, YOU KNOW, IF THERE'S SOME CONCERN SQUEEZING IT BACK IN FEASIBILITY-WISE IS WHAT I WANT TO UNDERSTAND. DOES IT MAKE IT HARDER, ON SMALLER LOTS? TO MAKE AN ADU FEASIBLE IF WE TIGHTEN IT, BUT IT SEEMS LIKE A TIGHT ENOUGH MARGIN THAT THERE'S ROOM TO KIND OF MAKE IT WORK. BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT, LIKE, OVERLAPPING IT, SIDE YARD AND THE REAR YARD AND THE AREA THAT'S KIND OF A -- VENN DIAGRAM OR NO BUILD OR, LIKE, COMPOUNDING. USABLE AREA. SO I DON'T KNOW KIND OF -- EXACTLY WHERE I'M GOING WITH THIS, BUT JUST KIND OF LAYING OUT ALL THE VARIABLES FOR EVERYBODY. THAT, YOU KNOW, I'M OPEN TO THE DISCUSSION, I'M REALLY NOT KIND OF CONVINCED EITHER WAY. I'M JUST KIND OF -- IF ANYBODY WANTS TO KIND OF -- THERE'S OPINIONS ON BOTH SIDES THAT I CAN SUPPORT. BRETT?
02:12:44.991: >> BRETT:  WE'RE HAPPY TO EXPLORE ANY OF THESE REQUIREMENTS. OR CHANGES, BUT ONE THING, I GUESS I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT FROM A -- FROM A AFFORDABILITY OR SUSTAINABILITY LENS, ONE OF THE PROVISIONS, I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S CLEAR, WE UNDERSTAND WHERE WE'RE STARTING FROM. THE CURRENT ORDINANCE SAYS THAT IF YOU HAD A DETACHED ACCESSORY STRUCTURE, BY THE END OF 2016, YOU ARE GENERALLY ELIGIBLE, FOR A DETACHED -- ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT. IF YOU DIDN'T, YOU'RE NOT. FOR THOSE THAT ARE ELIGIBLE, YOU COULD, INSTALL ONE IN YOUR EXISTING DETACHED ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT. SO LONG AS IT MET OUR CURRENT REQUIREMENTS, WHICH IS 3 FEET FROM THE SIDE PROPERTY LINE, AND 3 FEET FROM THE REAR PROPERTY LINE. AND 35% LOT COVERAGE, HAS TO MAKE THE HEIGHT, ET CETERA, YOU COULD -- IF YOU WERE QUALIFYING, YOU COULD -- ALTER THAT ACCESSORY BUILDING IF IT WASN'T COMPLIANT, MAKE IT, COMPLIANT. TO MEET THAT -- IF IT WAS ONLY ONE FOOT OFF THE PROPERTY LINE, YOU COULD MODIFY IT, MAKE IT THREE FEET OFF THE PROPERTY LINE, AND REALIZE AN ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT, THERE. YOU COULD LIKEWISE, DEMOLISH IT, AND BUILD A TOTALLY NEW DETACHED ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT, COMPLIANT WITH THE THREE FEET. SO I -- SO I JUST WANT TO ADD, THAT, IF WE DO EXPLORE SOME CHANGE TO A 5 FEET SETBACK, YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO BE PUTTING, MORE -- IT'S NOT GOING TO MATTER, OBVIOUSLY, SO MUCH, I THINK, FROM A VIABILITY, FOR THOSE THAT AREN'T ELIGIBLE NOW, AND WOULD BECOME ELIGIBLE. IT MIGHT HAVE SOME IMPACT FOR THOSE WHO HAVE EXISTING STRUCTURE FROM AN AFFORDABILITY, SUSTAINABILITY DESIRE TO TRY TO REUTILIZE THOSE, BUT, AGAIN, I DON'T -- I DON'T HAVE ALL THE DATA TO TELL YOU HOW MANY THERE ARE, THAT ARE 3 FEET OFF THE PROPERTY LINE, AND HOW MANY ARE LESS OR MORE; SO, I JUST WANT TO -- THAT'S -- THAT'S SOMETHING IN MY MIND ABOUT THAT STANDARD, I THINK THAT THERE'S PROBABLY, I WOULD -- I THINK THERE'S MORE PROPERTIES THAT ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR A DETACHED NOW, THAN ARE. SO -- YOU'RE -- IT'S -- IT'S KIND OF A -- MORE NARROW, APPLICATION, I THINK, BUT, THAT -- THAT -- I -- I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT WOULD DEFINITELY ELIMINATE SOME EXISTING ACCESSORY STRUCTURES FROM BEING ABLE TO BE CONVEED INTO....
02:15:24.183: >> THAS HELPFUL, BECAUSE IT'S, LIKE, A RENOVATION OF THAT 3 SO, I MEAN, I -- IHINK LEAVING IT AS IS, AN AGAIN,T'S VING, WE CANPDATE THE THIN, AND KIND  SEE WHAT HAPPENS. H BEEN ERE,ND WE'RE NOT MODIFYING IT. IN ANYONDITION YET,EEMSIKE A GOOD W TO GO THE
02:15:57.116: >> ANY OTHER DISCUSSION BEFORE WE ASK FOR A ROLL CALL VOTE?
02:16:04.156: >> SARAH MILLS, CHAIR:  ALL RIGHT, MR. LEONARD, I THINK WE ARE READY TO VOTE ON THE PROPOSED ORDINANCE, AMENDMENTS.

02:16:47.766: >> COMMISSIONER SAUVE.
02:16:48.400: >> YES.
02:16:49.301: >> IT CARRIES UNANIMOUSLY.
02:16:50.669: >> VERY GOOD, THANK YOU VERY MUCH, THANKS, AGAIN, FOR STAFF PUTTING THIS TOGETHER. THANKS ALSO TO EVERYONE, WHO -- FOR POSTPONING THIS SO THAT WE COULD HAVE THE DISCUSSION, AT A NOT SO LATE HOUR, I THINK IT WAS HELPED BY THAT. AND SOME ADDITIONAL TIME TO -- YOU KNOW, FOR STAFF TO PULL THINGS TOGETHER, SO THANK YOU. ITEM NO. 10, ON OUR AGENDA, IS REGULAR BUSINESS, AND THERE IS NONE, SO WE'RE GOING TO SKIP OVER THAT TO ITEM 11 WHICH IS PUBLIC COMMENT. THIS IS, THE FINAL OPPORTUNITY FOR PERSONS TO SPEAK FOR UP TO THREE MINUTES, ABOUT ANY ITEM OF INTEREST. PUBLIC COMMENT, CAN BE MADE, BY CALLING 877-853-5247 AND ENTERING MEETING I.D. 990, 9896, 8122, CITY STAFF WILL SELECT CALLERS WHO HAVE RAISED THEIR HANDS YOU DO THAT BY PRESSING STAR 9 ON YOUR OWN, YOU'LL GET THE AUTOMATED MESSAGE, THAT YOU'RE -- THE HOST IS ALLOW YOG ATO SPEAK, AND MR. ATO SPEAK, AND MR. LEONARD WILL WILL YOU THE LAST 3 DIGITS OF YOUR TELEPHONE NUMBER, PLEASE DO MUTE ANY BACKGROUND SOUNDS, SO THAT WE CAN HEAR YOU, CLEARLY, AND DO STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS AT THE BEGINNING OF YOUR COMMENTS, PLEASE,
02:18:08.447: >> PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 534, CALLER WITH PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 534. UNMUTE YOUR PHONE AND ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
02:18:17.022: >> CALLER:  HI, THIS IS TOM S. I WANT TO THANK COMMISSIONER SAUVE FOR CATCHING AN ERROR THAT I MADE. I TOSSED THAT OUT AT THE END WITH THE DUPLEXES WITHOUT THINKING IT THROUGH, SO THANK YOU FOR CATCHING THAT. THE DUPLEX ISSUE, I DON'T WANT TO TAIL WAGGING THE DOG ANYHOW ON THIS, YOU'VE MADE YOUR DECISION, IT'S DONE. THERE'S SOME THINGS THAT I WOULD DISAGREE, BUT THERE'S NO POINT IN ARGUING ABOUT RIGHT NOW. ONE THING THAT I REALLY DO THINK IS IMPORTANT TO MENTION, I DO FEEL THAT THESE ARE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES, THE AVERAGE PERSON SEES THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG, AND MAYBE THERE WAS THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG IN 2016, WELL, NOW WE'VE MADE THAT 90% OF THE ICEBERG UNDER THE WATER REAL RATHER THAN HPOTHETICAL. AND THE AVERAGE PERSON, IS NOT AWARE OF THAT. THIS IS NOT WHAT THE AVERAGE PERSON THINKS AN ADU IS. TECHNICALLY, THESE ARE ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS, AND WE CAN CALL THIS AN ORDINANCE REVISION, FOR ALL THE TECHNICAL REASONS, AND, GO TO THE TECHNICAL NOTICES THAT ARE REQUIRED, FOR AN ORDINANCE REVISION, AND REFER TO THAT. IN THE END, WHAT DO WE REALLY WANT AS A COMMUNITY? WE WANT FOR THE CITIZENS TO BE WELL-INFORMED, TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THESE CHANGES MEAN, AND TO BE ABLE TO WEIGH IN, WITH THEIR OPINIONS, AND IF THE CITIZENS WANT THIS, THAT'S GREAT. THEY'VE BOUGHT INTO THIS, BECAUSE THEY UNDERSTAND IT. I'M CONVINCED THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF CITIZENS HAVE NO CLUE, THE EXTENT OF THESE CHANGES, WHICH ARE VERY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES, I DON'T WANT TO DOWN-PLAY THEM AND I DON'T THINK ANYBODY SHOULD DOWN-PLAY THEM. AND IF THE CITIZENS ARE TOLD -- AND UNDERSTAND -- THIS IS NOT WHAT THEY THOUGHT OF AN ADU BEING, THIS IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT. THIS IS SOMETHING MUCH MORE SIGNIFICANT, MORE IMPACTFUL, AND IF THE CITIZENS WANT IT, THEN GREAT. I THINK IT'S WRONG, TO NOT NOTIFY THE CITIZENS, BECAUSE, THESE ARE SUCH DRASTIC CHANGES. THESE ARE SO FAR FROM WHAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE ADU TO BE. AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE WOULDN'T NOTIFY THEM, AND EDUCATE THEM, WE'RE ALL HERE, I'M SORRY, YOU'RE ALL HERE DOING WORK FOR THE CITY.
02:20:48.907: >> 30 MORE SECONDS.
02:20:50.542: >> TOM:  THE CITY IS ALL OF US, THE CITY IS THE CITIZENS, (SOUND OF DOG BARKING), THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW, AND TO UNDERSTAND THESE CHANGES, SO, IT'S UP TO COUNCIL NOW, TO DECIDE HOW ARE WE GOING TO NOTIFY THE CITIZENS AND EDUCATE THEM, SO THAT THEY CAN TELL US WHAT THEY REALLY THINK ABOUT THESE CHANGES. BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW. THANK YOU.
02:21:11.363: >> SARAH MILLS, CHAIR:  THANK YOU. (DOG BARKING IN BACKGROUND),
02:21:19.671: >> CALLER WITH PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 556. CALLER WITH PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 556. THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
02:21:29.181: >> HI, THIS IS RALPH M., AGAIN, CAN YOU HEAR ME OKAY?
02:21:32.718: >> SARAH MILLS, CHAIR:  WE CAN.
02:21:33.886: >> RALPH: I GUESS I WOULD WANT TO START WITH JUST BEING DISAPPOINTED ABOUT SEVERAL ITEMS, AND I -- I IMAGINE YOU'RE PRETTY SICK OF HEARING ME TALK ABOUT THESE ITEMS, BUT, I FEEL KIND OF COMPELLED, AFTER LISTENING TO A WHOLE BUNCH OF THESE MEETINGS, AND, WRITING, AND TALKING AT THESE MEETINGS SEVERAL TIMES. I AM A LITTLE BIT AMAZED AT THE -- AT THE -- JUST, THE RESULT -- I WONDER WHY WE HAVE PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT, TO BE FRANK. ON EVERY ISSUE, THAT I CAN THINK OF, THE -- PRETTY MUCH EVERY COMMENTER -- AND I SHOULD SAY EVERY BUT THE VAST MAJORITY OF COMMENTERS, WANTED MORE NOTICE. YOU SAID NO. MANY COMMENTERS TALKED ABOUT THE SETBACKS, YOU DID ACTUALLY DISCUSS THAT. AND DECIDED, NO, WE DON'T WANT TO CHANGE THAT. THE VAST MAJORITY, 25 TO 9 BY MY COUNT, WANTED TO RETAIN THE OWNER OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENT. NO. NOT DOING THAT. THERE ARE LOTS OF GOOD ARGUMENTS, MADE, BY COMMENTERS, AND, MANY OF THEM, DIDN'T EVEN GET ADDRESSED. AND, IF YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE DECISIONS, THAT PRETTY MUCH GO AGAINST ALL THE PUBLIC INPUT THAT YOU GET, WHY ARE WE WASTING OUR TIME? AND, IT -- I WOULD SUSPECT THAT THAT WOULD HAVE -- INCREASED, THE SEVERITY OF THE NUMBER -- IF YOU HAD IDENTIFIED MORE PEOPLE, YOU WOULD HAVE GOTTEN, AN EVEN HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE OPPOSING NUMEROUS THINGS AND THAT DOESN'T REALLY BOTHER ME AS SUCH AS THE -- SORT OF, THE LACK OF SOME OF THE ARGUMENTS, AND I -- AND I, OBVIOUSLY, CAN'T GO THROUGH ALL OF YOUR ARGUMENTS IN THREE MINUTES, YOU JUST SPENT AN HOUR DOING THAT. BUT I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS MAYBE ONE, WHICH IS IF YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE ONE DATA POINT OF VANCOUVER, WITHOUT GETTING INTO ANY DETAIL LIKE MAYBE THOSE UNITS WERE AFFORDABLE BECAUSE THEY WERE BUILT A LONG TIME AGO, WHEN THE -- WHEN THE -- WHEN THE BUILDING COSTS WERE LOWER, AND THEN, I -- TO BE FAIR, COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN, HE ACTUALLY DID SOME HOMEWORK, RATHER THAN JUST SPOUTING TALKING POINTS, AND I'LL RESPECT THAT, BUT NONE OF YOU SEEMED TO NOTICE THAT THIS ARGUMENT TOTALLY DESTROYED ONE OF YOUR OTHER ARGUMENTS WHICH WAS THAT OLDER OWNERS, WILL GO OUT AND TAKE A LOAN ON A HOME EQUITY LOAN TO BUILD ONE OF THESE THINGS
02:24:04.736: >> 30 SECONDS.
02:24:05.404: >> GUESS WHAT? IF THE RENT ISN'T GOING TO PAY FOR IT, YOU'RE GOING TO GET FORCLOSED OUT OF YOUR HOUSE. THINK ABOUT THE INCONSISTENCY OF THOSE TWO POSITIONS, THEY'RE TOTALLY INTELLECTUALLY DISHONEST IF YOU LOOK AT THEM BOTH BUT YOU ACCEPT THEM BOTH. HEY, YOU REALLY NEED TO APPLY SOME BETTER CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS HERE, THANK YOU.
02:24:26.525: >> SARAH MILLS, CHAIR:  THANK YOU.
02:24:33.799: >> CALLER WITH PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 764. CALLER WITH PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 764. YOU CAN UNMUTE YOUR PHONE AND ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION
02:24:43.041: >> CALLER: --
02:24:46.378: >> SARAH MILLS, CHAIR:  YOU CAN PRESS STAR 6 TO UNMUTE YOUR PHONE.
02:24:53.085: >>...
02:24:56.621: >> CALLER WITH PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 764, YOU CAN PRESS STAR 6 TO UNMUTE YOUR PHONE AND ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION. GO AHEAD.
02:25:09.234: >> (A PAUSE). CALLER ENDING WITH 764, ARE YOU THERE? SARAH MILLS, CHAIR:  ON OUR END YOU'RE APPEARING TO BE UNMUTED
02:25:28.587: >> HELLO.
02:25:29.021: >> YES, WE CAN HEAR YOU NOW.
02:25:31.223: >> ARGUING INVESTORS ARE KEY TO INCREASING ADUS AND ARGUING INVESTORS WON'T -- MAKE MUCH IMPACT, JUST LOOKS SILLY! COMPANIES LIKE OXFORD PROPERTIES ALREADY MANAGE
02:25:45.971: >> EXCUSE ME.
02:25:46.538: >> MANAGE PORTFOLIOS WITH INDIVIDUAL RENTAL HOUSES.
02:25:48.407: >> SARAH MILLS, CHAIR:  COULD YOU PROVIDE YOUR NAME PLEASE AT THE BEGINNING OF YOUR COMMENT AND THEN GO AHEAD AND START?
02:25:53.912: >> I'LL START OVER. I'M JOHN FLOYD. ARGUING THAT INVESTORS ARE KEY, TO INCREASING ADUS, AND ARGUING THAT INVESTORS WON'T MAKE MUCH INPUT -- MUCH DIFFERENCE, LOOKS A LITTLE BIT SILLY. COMPANIES LIKE OXFORD PROPERTIES ALREADY MANAGE LARGE PORTFOLIOS OF RENTAL PROPERTIES IN ANN ARBOR, ARGUING THAT THOSE DON'T EXIST, WHEN THEY ALREADY DO, LOOKS SILLY! THE FRIENDS AND FAMILY ARGUMENT ABOUT WHO LIVES IN ADU ASSUMES THOSE ARE OWNER-OCCUPIED. IF THEY'RE INVESTOR OCCUPIED, THOSE AREN'T FRIENDS AND FAMILY. VANCOUVER IS A LARGE CITY, AND A LARGE METRO AREA LAND-LOCKED IN BETWEEN THE OCEAN, AND MOUNTAINS. YOU MAY NOT HAVE NOTICED ANN ARBOR IS A SMALL COMMUNITY IN THE MIDDLE OF A PRAIRIE. THE DISTANCE BETWEEN CITY HALL YPSILANTI AND CITY HALL OF ANN ARBOR, WOULD NOT GET YOU VERY FAR ACROSS VANCOUVER, MUCH LESS VERY FAR ACROSS DETROIT A CRISIS IMNENT BAD EVENT AND LLOUT FROM A BAD EVEN EVICTION IS A HOUSING CRISIS, I WISH I LIVED IN A DIFFERENT ZIP CODE IS NOT A HOUSING CRISIS, MISUSING LANGUAGE DOES NOT IMPROVE CREDIBILITY OF GOVERNMENT. IF IT WALKS LIKE A ZONING CHANGE, AND IT TALKS LIKE A NING CHANGE,T'S NOT A DUCK, IT'S A ZONING CHANGE. STORY IT FEE GOOD, YOU STICK TO IT. AND HATS OFF T YOUOR FINDING WAY TO WALROUND LAW. JU BECAUSE YOUROCIAL S COMMUNITY THVERYONE I IT LIS ONLINE A THE IDEA WN WE P AHOLE BUN O SOCIAL MEA POSTS THA THAT ADDRESS THE ISSUE, O HOMEOWNERSS NOT REALTIC. I ARECIE YOUORNG ON THE COMMITE, IT'S VOLUNTEER, I KNOW IT'A PAIN IN THE BUTT AND FROM PEOPLE LIKE ME CALLING IN BUT I THINK THAT THERE'S A LOT OF PROCESS, PROBLEM, AND A LOT OF BAD... ATTEMPTS, AT LOGIC. AND, FALSE ANALOGIES, THAT DOESN'T ENHANCE YOUR CREDIBILITY. THANK YOU, AND GOOD NIGHT.
02:28:01.506: >> SARAH MILLS, CHAIR:  THANK YOU.
02:28:10.582: >> CALLER WITH PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 326, CALLER WITH PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 326.
02:28:20.959: >>, YES, HI, JEFF. 506 EAST KINGSLY, I APPRECIATE THE BRIEF CONVERSATION ON ENFORCEMENT, BUT, BUT IT REALLY MISSED MY POINT. THERE IS A PROCESS AN EASY PROCESS, IN PLACE, TO IDENTIFY PROBLEMS WITH YOUR TRASH. THERE'S AN E26 -- WHERE YOU CAN GO AND REPORT IT, THERE'S A RESPONSE, THE RESPONSE GETS PLOTTED. BUT AS FAR AS I CAN TELL, THE PROCESS INVOLVED IN REPORTING PROBLEMS OR WHAT WILL BE REPORTING PROBLEMS, IN REGARDS TO ADU PROJECTS IS MUCH LESS TRANSPARENT. AND TO MY KNOWLEDGE, WHEN I REPORTED THINGS IN -- IN SIGNAGE, I DID NOT GET ANY KIND OF CASE NUMBER. IT WAS CONNECTING TO AN INDIVIDUAL PERSON, SO, WHAT I'M REQUESTING, IS THAT MR. LEONARD DEVELOPS A STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE, FOR WHAT IS GOING TO BE ADU ENFORCEMENT, THAT'S JUST THE LEAST THAT COULD BE DONE SO THAT THE PERSON, WHO ENCOUNTERS SUDDENLY, A PROBLEM IN THEIR BACKYARD, KNOWS WHAT TO DO. RIGHT NOW, YOU GO TO THE PLANNING WEB SITE, YOU SEND AN E-MAIL, AND THAT'S IT, WITHOUT ANY GUIDANCE, AND THAT SIMPLY, IS NOT TRANSPARENT, AND I UNDERSTAND WHY YOU COULDN'T SIMPLY EXPAND, THAT SYSTEM, INVOLVED, IN ZONING ENFORCEMENT. TO A2 FIX IT. IT'S A GOOD SYSTEM, THE OTHER ADVANTAGE AS I SAID BEFORE, THAT IS -- NOT WHAT YOU GET, WHEN YOU LOOK ON A TRACK-IT IS YOU CAN'T SEE A PLOT OF ALL THE DIFFERENT VIOLATIONS, AS YOU CAN ON A2 FIX IT. SO I THINK, THAT'S WHAT TRUE TRANSPARENCY IS. IN REQUIRING PEOPLE TO LOOK UP AN ETRACK IT, ABOUT A SPECIFIC COMPLAINT, GETS VERY DIFFICULT. SO, I ENCOURAGE MR. LEONARD, TO DEVELOP A SET OF GUIDELINES, SPECIFIC TO THE REPORTING OF POTENTIAL ADU VIOLATIONS, TO -- MAKE IT A LOT MORE EXPERIMENT. THANK YOU, FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION,
02:30:41.166: >> SARAH MILLS, CHAIR:  THANK YOU.
02:30:50.575: >> YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
02:30:54.379: >> HELLO, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
02:30:55.847: >> SARAH MILLS, CHAIR:  WE CAN.
02:30:57.115: >> CALLER:  OKAY, GOOD, THANKS, YES, THIS IS ANNE BANISTER, FORMER COUNCIL MEMBER FROM WARD 1. AND I WANT TO THANK YOU, ALL, FOR YOUR SERVICE, BUT I DO WANT TO ECHO, SOME OF THE CONCERNS FROM ALL OF THE RESIDENTS WHO HAVE BEEN CALLING IN. I SERVE ON THE NATURAL FEATURES SUBCOMMITTEE, UNDER CHAIR CHRISTOPHER GRAHAM, AND WE ARE WORKING HARD ON TREE PROTECTION ORDINANCES, FOR ANN ARBOR'S LANDMARK, AND HERITAGE CANOPY -- TREE CANOPY, AND THIS ORDINANCE, WHICH YOU ALL ARE BRINGING FORTH, MAKES NO MENTION OR PROTECTION FOR THESE NATURAL FEATURES, AND, SO, I FEEL STRONGLY THAT THAT'S A VIOLATION OF OUR BEST INTERESTS, WHEN IT COMES TO A20, AND -- AND, SO I'M VERY SORRY TO SEE THAT. AND UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES, WITH DRAINAGE. AND SO, I THINK WE THE SOLUTIONS TO WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO, ARE MUCH MORE TO BUILD ON BROWNFIELDS, AND AREAS THAT ARE ALREADY COVERED IN ASPHALT AND CONCRETE. SUCH AS SOME OF THE TRANSIT AREAS DOWN BY SEARS, AND WE'VE GOT PLENTY OF GOOD PLACES TO INCENTIVIZE BUILDING, RATHER THAN IN THESE ESTABLISHED NEIGHBORHOODS, WITH OUR DWINDLING, REMAINING TREE CANOPY AND NATURAL FEATURES, IT'S SO CONTRARY, TO -- TO VALUES ABOUT THE CLIMATE CRISIS. AND, LASTLY, I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE LACK OF PUBLIC NOTICE. THERE WAS MENTION THAT THERE WAS SOME -- THAT THE FACT SHEET WAS PUT OUT ON A PRESS RELEASE. I MONITOR THOSE THINGS, AND I DEFINITELY DID NOT SEE THE PRESS RELEASE, THAT WAS REFERENCED. AND, I -- I AGREE WITH THE OTHER CALLERS, THAT, 99% OF THE PEOPLE, ARE -- ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH WHAT YOU -- THE IDEOLOGY IS BEING LAID DOWN, UPON US, SO, I HOPE THAT -- AT THE COUNCIL LEVEL,
02:33:28.600: >> 30 MORE SECONDS.
02:33:30.401: >> COUNSELORS WILL BRING FORTH THE RESOLUTION, TO AT LEAST SEND THE POSTCARDS TO THESE 20,000 PROPERTIES, AND I HOPE THAT, THE TREES AND THE NATURAL FEATURES ADVOCATES WILL COME FORTH AS THIS PROCESS MOVES FORWARD. THANK YOU.

02:34:32.196: >> SARAH MILLS, CHAIR:  GREAT.
02:34:33.064: >> CALLER:  THIS IS CYNTHIA PRICE, 2800 PAGE AVENUE. I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR PASSING THESE CHANGES, TO THE ADU ORDINANCE. WHICH, I THINK BRING ANN ARBOR BETTER IN LINE WITH WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS. AND I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH CHAIR MILLS THAT IF THERE ARE DIFFICULTIES WITH SOME PORTION OF IT, YOU KNOW, SINCE THESE ARE -- TO ONE DEGREE OR ANOTHER, NEW IDEAS AND POSSIBLY UNPRECEDENTED THAT NOTHING PREVENTS REVISING IT AGAIN TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS THAT HAVE ARISEN, THANK YOU. BYE.
