00:00:34.043: >> I PLEDGE ALLEGIANCE TO THE FLAG OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, AND TO THE REPUBLIC FOR WHICH IT STANDS:  ONE NATION UNDER GOD, INDIVISIBLE, WITH LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL.
00:00:54.063: >> Mayor Taylor: WOULD OUR CLERK PLEASE CALL THE ROLL OF COUNCIL.

00:01:49.618: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI: HERE.
00:01:52.054: >> Clerk Beaudry: WE HAVE A QUORUM.
00:01:53.422: >> Mayor Taylor: MAY I HAVE A MOTION TO APPROVE THE AGENDA. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER SMITH. SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI. DISCUSSION OF THE AGENDA? COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
00:02:04.133: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. I WOULD LIKE TO REQUEST THAT DC-2 BE REMOVED FROM TONIGHT'S AGENDA. YESTERDAY I RECEIVED THE GOOD NEWS THAT STEPHANIE STAUFFER WHO WAS UP FOR REAPPOINTMENT TO THE GREENVILLE ADVISORY COMMISSION HAS JUST BEEN MADE THE NEW MANAGER OF THE FARMER'S MARKET, WHICH IS GREAT NEWS FOR THE CITY, BUT I EXPRESSED SOME CONCERNS THAT THA THANKFULLY FRM THE ATTORNEY'S OFFICE GOT BACK TO ME, IT WAS NOT A CONFLICT BUT THE OPTICS ON IT WERE NOT GREAT AND IT WOULD BE IN HER BEST INTEREST TO STEP DOWN FROM GREENBELT AND SERVE AS THE MARKET MANAGER. WE WANT TO WELCOME STEPHANIE AS THE MARKET MANAGER AND THANK FOR YOUR SERVICE.
00:02:48.410: >> Mayor Taylor: ANY OBJECTION TO THE REMOVAL OF DC-2? BY ACCLAMATION. FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE AGENDA AS AMENDED? ALL IN FAVOR?
00:03:01.724: >> City Admin. Crawford: MAYOR?
00:03:02.391: >> Mayor Taylor: TOM? MR. CRAWFORD?
00:03:06.629: >> City Admin. Crawford: WOULD THE COUNCIL CONSIDER MOVING DS1 TO AFTER DB-2. IT WOULD ALLOW THE FLOW OF THE MEETING BETTER AND THE BUDGET ITEMS BE TOGETHER.
00:03:19.008: >> Mayor Taylor: MOVED BY LUMM AND SECONDED BY SMITH. DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR OF THAT AMENDMENT? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT'S AMENDED. SOMEONE WILL HAVE TO REMIND ME ABOUT THAT WHEN WE GET THERE, PLEASE.
00:03:29.985: >> Clerk Beaudry: MAYOR, I'M SORRY, CAN YOU TELL ME WHERE WE'RE MOVING THAT?
00:03:33.289: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU, MY APOLOGIES. WE ARE MOVING THAT TO -- IMMEDIATELY AFTER DB-1.
00:03:42.431: >> Clerk Beaudry: THAT'S DS-1?
00:03:46.335: >> City Admin. Crawford: RIGHT. WILL.
00:03:47.236: >> Mayor Taylor: THAT'S DS-1 AFTER DB-
00:03:56.312: >> Clerk Beaudry: DB?
00:03:56.812: >> Mayor Taylor: ONE. ALL IN FAVOR OF THE AGENDA AS AMENDED, PLEASE SAY AYE. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? THE AGENDA IS APPROVED. DO WE HAVE COMMUNICATIONS FROM OUR CITY ADMINISTRATOR.
00:04:07.723: >> City Admin. Crawford: YES, JUST A COUPLE OF THINGS. IF YOU HAVEN'T HEARD, I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ALLEN CREEK BERM OPENING PROJECT HAD A SIGNIFICANT EVENT THIS WEEK WITH THE INSTALLATION OF THE TUNNELS UNDERNEATH THE RAILROAD TRACK. IT IS STILL NOT OPEN TO THE PUBLIC, BUT IT IS A SIGNIFICANT ADVANCEMENT IN THIS COMPLICATED AND LONG PROJECT. SO KUDOS TO EVERYONE THAT WAS WORKING ON THAT. I ALSO WANTED TO POINT OUT TO YOU THAT THE -- A NUMBER OF PEOPLE, THE DDA, THE MERCHANT ASSOCIATIONS, A NUMBER OF MEMBERS OF STAFF, HAVE BEEN MEETING, TRYING TO LOOK AT A DOWNTOWN REOPENING AT SOME POINT. IT WILL REOPEN ONE DAY. WE DON'T KNOW WHEN, BUT IN PREPARATION OF THAT AND WHAT THAT MIGHT MEAN FOR THE USE OF PUBLIC SPACE AND HOW TO ENCOURAGE AND BASICALLY IMPLEMENT GOOD PHYSICAL DISTANCING, THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF EFFORTS AND MEETINGS GOING. I ANTICIPATE SOMETHING COMING TO YOU JUNE 1st AT THE MEETING. IT'S A PLAN THAT WOULD HOPEFULLY INCORPORATE ALL OF THE DIFFERENT RISES OF THE DOWNTOWN. AND THE GOALS THAT STAFF HAD GOING INTO THIS WERE TO SUPPORT PHYSICAL DISTANCING, TO ENCOURAGE THE SAFE PATRONAGE OF OUR BUSINESSES DOWNTOWN AND TO REINFORCE OUR PRINCIPLES OF SAFETY MOBILITY, EQUITY IN THE DOWNTOWN VITALITY. SO JUST BE AWARE THAT THAT'S BEING WORKED ON. IT'S ON ITS WAY. THAT'S ALL.
00:05:33.409: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. WE NOW HAVE INTRODUCTION NUMBER ONE A2ZERO, CARBON NEUTRALITY GOVERNANCE PLAN, PRIORITIZATION FRAMEWORK AND INVESTMENT SCENARIO. DR. STULTS.
00:05:49.925: >> CAN YOU HEAR ME OKAY? THANK YOU MAYOR TAYLOR, MEMBERS OF COUNCIL. IT'S MY PLEASURE TO BE HERE. I WILL TOGGLE BETWEEN A FEW THINGS TO SHARE WITH YOU. SO BEAR WITH ME FOR JUST A SECOND. EXCELLENT. SO GRACIOUSLY, ADMINISTRATOR CRAWFORD GAVE US A FEW MINUTES TO KIND OF REVIEW THE DOCUMENTS WE PUT IN YOUR COUNCIL PACKET AS A RESPONSE TO YOUR APRIL APRIL 20th MEETING. SO WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO WITH YOU TODAY, IS WALK THROUGH THOSE DOCUMENTS. WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME TOGETHER, BUT I WOULD LIKE TO TALK THROUGH THEM WITH YOU. WE HAVE A PRIORITIZATION FRAMEWORK, A GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK AND THE INVESTMENT PLAN. AND IF TIME PERMITS I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SPEND A FEW MINUTES ADDRESSING SOME QUESTIONS I RECEIVED FROM COUNCIL OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS. SO THE FIRST DOCUMENT WE RECEIVED AND AGAIN I WILL TOGGLE BETWEEN THESE DOCUMENTS OR THAT WE SHARED WITH YOU, WAS A GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK. NOW, THIS DOCUMENT WAS NOT EXPLICITLY ASKED FOR AT -- DURING OUR CONVERSATION ON THE 20th BUT A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS CENTERED AROUND ELEMENTS ADDRESSED IN THIS. A LOT OF OUR CONVERSATION FOCUSED ON HOW WAS THE A2ZERO PLAN GOING TO LIVE AND HOW DO WE MAKE CHANGES TO THE DOCUMENT AND HOW DO THEY INTERACT TOGETHER? BASED ON THAT CONVERSATION, WE CREATED THIS DOCUMENT TO PROVIDE THE OVERARCHING STRUCTURE FOR THE WORK WE ARE DOING AND WHAT THIS SLIDE SHOWS IS JUST A REFERENCE TO WHAT DOCUMENTS OR MATERIALS INFORM THE VARIOUS ELEMENTS. SO THINKING ABOUT WHERE WE ARE GOING TO GO, WE HAVE THE MISSION, VISION AND VALUES. THINKING ABOUT WHERE WE ARE, WE HAVE OUR BASELINE ASSESSMENTS. WE HAVE THE PLAN AND THE WORK MAN AND THE REVISIONS AND THEN HOW WE KNOW WE GET THERE ARE THE METRICS AND REPORTING. AND THE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK TIES ALL OF THESE VARIOUS ELEMENTS TO GO. SO I'M GOING TO GO TO THE DOCUMENT VERY QUICKLY AND WALK THROUGH IT IN THAT WAY. THIS WAS PART OF YOUR COUNCIL PACKET. SO THE DOCUMENT ITSELF, I'M GOING TO MOSTLY FOCUS ON THE GOVERNANCE MODEL, THE GRAPHIC THAT IS IN HERE, BUT WHAT WE WILL NOTE IS THE DOCUMENT HAS INTRODUCTORY TEXT AND PROVIDES MUCH MORE SUBSTANCE ABOUT WHAT'S IN THE GRAPHIC ITSELF. SO THE MODEL IS BROKEN DOWN INTO FOUR CORE ELEMENTS. AT THE TOP, YOU HAVE SORT OF THE KEEPERS, THE CARE TAKERS OF THE CARBON NEUTRALITY WORK, AND SO AS A CITY DOCUMENT, THE CITY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS ELEMENT. AND THEN THE STAFF IN THE OFFICE OF SUSTAINABILITY AND INNOVATIONS REALLY ARE SORT OF THE CARE TAKERS FOR A LOT OF THIS WORK. AT LEAST THAT'S HOW WE SEE THIS BEING PROPOSED. ON THE FAR RIGHT SIDE, YOU SEE THE KEY STAKEHOLDERS. SORRY ON THE FAR LEFT SIDE FOR YOU. YOU SEE THE KEY STAKEHOLDERS THAT INFORM AND HELP IMPLEMENT THE STRATEGIES THAT ARE IN THIS WORK. SO THOSE ARE, OF COURSE, RESIDENTS AND BUSINESSES. OUR CIVIL SOCIETY AND LABOR ORGANIZATIONS, THE MAJOR INSTITUTIONS, THE GOVERNMENT, AND THAT'S NOT JUST US. THAT'S ALSO THE COUNTY AND OTHER PARTNERS. SO THOSE ARE THE KEY STAKEHOLDERS THAT CERTAINLY INFORM EVERYTHING THAT WE DO.
00:08:37.259: >> Mayor Taylor: DR. STULTS, I'M SORRY. THIS IS CHRISTOPHER. I'M SORRY SO INTERRUPT. VISUALLY, WE -- WELL, WE HAVE -- IT'S MOSTLY -- IT SEEMS TO BE A SPEAKER VIEW RATHER THAN A SLIDE SHOW VIEW. SO THE SLIDE IS MINIMIZED.
00:08:51.607: >> I APPRECIATE THAT. I MAY NOT BE ABLE TO TOGGLE BETWEEN. I WILL TRY TO FIX THAT. I APOLOGIZE.
00:08:57.379: >> Mayor Taylor: NO WORRIES.
00:08:59.781: >> WELL, ENJOY MY SPEAKER NOTES.
00:09:02.618: >> Mayor Taylor: EVERY WORD IS A PEARL!
00:09:04.353: >> LET ME GO FORWARD IN THIS FORMAT. I WILL TRY TO FIX THAT HERE IN A MOMENT IF POSSIBLE. SO ON THE FAR RIGHT SIDE, THEN WE HAVE THE ENGAGEMENT EVENT. WE HAVE THE STAKEHOLDERS ON THE LEFT AND ON THE RIGHT THE ENGAGEMENT EVENTS ARE THINGS THAT WE ALREADY DO OR NEW THINGS WE ARE PROPOSING TO CREATE TO INPUT AND MAKE REVISIONS TO THE PLAN. SO WHAT YOU CAN SEE ON THIS SIDE THAT WE ARE PROPOSING TO DO AN ANNUAL SURVEY OF OUR RESIDENTS AND BUSINESSES TO UNDERSTAND HOW THINGS ARE PROGRESSING TO GET NEW IDEAS, TO GET FEEDBACK TO INFORM REVISIONS. WE ARE PROPOSING HOSTING AN ANNUAL SUMMIT, WHICH IS A PLACE WHERE WE'LL ALSO DISCUSS NEW OPPORTUNITIES AND EXPLORE THEM IN GREATER DEPTHS. REALLY THINKING ABOUT HOW TO PRIORITIZE THE ACTIONS FOR THE COMING YEAR BUT ALSO PRESENT AN OPPORTUNITY TO CELEBRATE THE SUCCESSES THAT WE HAVE HAD, THE CHAMPIONS AND THE VANGUARDS WHO STEPPED UP TO MOVE THIS BALL FORWARD IN OUR COMMUNITY. WE HAVE A SUSTAINABILITY DASHBOARD AND I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT THAT'S LACKING AND THERE'S INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY TO UPDATE IT AND WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH IT TO FIGURE OUT AN AUTOMATED WAY WITH HOW WE ARE DOING IN TERMS OF MAKING PROGRESS AND OUR GOALS. WE ARE PROPOSAL ANNUAL COUNCIL DEEP DIVE SESSION AND MORE FREQUENT REPORTING ON HOW THINGS ARE PROGRESSING. OF COURSE THINGS WILL CONTINUALLY COME TO COUNCIL FOR ADOPTION AND CONSIDERATION. AND THEN THERE IS THE CORNERSTONE OF OUR EXISTING COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT EVENTS. SO EVERYTHING ABOVE THAT IS ADDITIONAL TO WHAT WE ALREADY DO WITH THE OFFICE. IN THE CENTER, ARE TWO BUCKETS. SO WE HAVE IN PLOW WITH -- KIND OF IN THE BLUE BACKGROUND ARE WHAT WE CALL THE ULTIMATE DECISION MAKERS. THESE ARE, OF COURSE, YOU AS CITY COUNCIL AND THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR. BELOW THAT, IN GREEN, WE HAVE WHAT WE CALL DECISION INFORMERS. AND DECISION INFORMERS INCLUDE A NEW ENTITY, A NEW COLLABORATION PARTNERSHIP THAT WE'RE PROPOSING, WHICH WOULD BE A CARBON NEUTRALITY TASK FORCE. THAT'S COMPRISED OF REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE MAJOR, LOCAL, AND REGIONAL INSTITUTIONS WORKING ON CARBON NEUTRALITY AND WE WILL MAKE THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN THE CARBON NEUTRALITY PARTNERS. IN ADDITION YOU SEE PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS, WHICH CAN HELP US SUPPLEMENT OUR CAPACITY TO DO THE WORK NEEDED TO GET DONE AS WELL AS STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITIES AND THESE ARE SPECIFIC THINGS THAT EMERGE THAT WE CAN'T NECESSARILY ANTICIPATE. IT COULD BE POLICY OPPORTUNITIES AND IT COULD BE FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES BUT, OF COURSE, THAT'S A KEY INFORMER OF WHEN WE MAKE -- TAKE ACTION OR WHEN WE MOVE FORWARD IN A CERTAIN -- IN A T CERTAIN WAY. AND RESIDENTS ARE THE KEY INFORMERS ACROSS THE ENTIRE SCOPE OF WHAT WE DO. COMBINED ALL OF THIS INFORMATION LEADS TO THE CARBON NEUTRALITY PLAN WHICH ARE SUPPORTED BY THE BUDGET PERFORMANCE REPORTS AND THE WORK PLANS OF STAFF, ET CETERA. SO THIS IS OUTLINED IN THE GOVERNANCE DOCUMENT THAT WE SHARED WITH YOU. THE SECOND DOCUMENT I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE IS THE PRIORITIZATION FRAMEWORK. AND AGAIN, I'M GOING TO TRY TO FIX THE IT. I MAY TRY TO DO A NEW SHARE HERE IN A SECOND BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE THIS DOCUMENT IN DEPTH. LET ME TRY ONE THING REALLY QUICK. CAN YOU SEE THIS SCREEN? I CAN'T SEE YOU.
00:12:25.187: >> Councilmember Smith: YES.
00:12:25.787: >> Mayor Taylor: YES, THIS IS A BETTER LOOK.
00:12:28.857: >> GREAT. FABULOUS. THIS IS THE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK. I KNOW THIS IS A LITTLE CHALLENGING. THIS IS THE PRIORITIZATION FRAMEWORK AND THERE ARE TWO DOCUMENTS WE SHARED WITH YOU. THE PRIORITIZATION FRAMEWORK, IT PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK FOR HOW WE CAN EVALUATE PROPOSED ACTS BOTH EXISTING ACTIONS ALREADY IN THE PLAN, BUT NEW ACTIONS AND I WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT EVERY ACTION THAT HAS IN THE CARBON NEUTRALITY PLAN HAS ALREADY GONE THROUGH THE PRIORITIZATION FRAMEWORK. EVERY PROPOSED ACTION WENT THROUGH THE PRIORITIZATION FRAMEWORK AND IT'S HOW WE LANDED ON THE FINAL CANDIDATE STRATEGIES THAT YOU HAVE IN THE PLAN ITSELF. SO THE PRIORITIZATION FRAMEWORK IS BROKEN INTO THESE FOUR CATEGORIES. WE LOOK AT THE CONTRIBUTION THAT A GIVEN ACTION HAS TO REDUCING GREEN HOUSE GAS EMISSIONS, THE COST-RELATED DIMENSIONS OF THAT ACTION, FEASIBILITY-RELATED CRITERION, WHICH I WILL GO TO HERE, AS WELL AS THE CO-BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT ACTION. AN EFFORT WAS TAKEN TO BALANCE THE SCORING IN EACH OF THESE CATEGORIES WITH 12 POSSIBLE POINTS AVAILABLE IN THE GREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION AND COST CATEGORIES. 10 POSSIBILITY POINTS AVAILABLE IN THE FEASIBILITY-RELATED AND 15 IN THE CO-BENEFITS. THIS COMES WITH 47 POSSIBLE POINTS THAT AN ACTION COULD RECEIVE. SO THIS IS, AGAIN, A SCREEN SHOT OF THE MATRIX AND WHAT YOU HAVE HERE ARE THE VARIOUS CRITERION. SO YOU HAVE THE OVERARCHING UMBRELLA AND THEN YOU HAVE THE SUBCATEGORIES AND YOU HAVE DETAIL AND HOW YOU WOULD SCORE THEM WITH THE POINT STRUCTURE. AGAIN, THIS IS JUST A PROPOSED ANALYSIS. WE ALSO SHARED WITH YOU STAFF'S COMPLETED ANALYSIS OF THE 44 ACTIONS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THE EXISTING A2 CARBON NEUTRALITY PLAN AND YOU CAN SEE HOW THEY SCORED. AGAIN, THEY ARE BROKEN DOWN BY EACH OF THESE CATEGORIES. HERE YOU HAVE A TOTAL SCORE AND HERE YOU HAVE A RANKED SCORE AND THESE ARE WEIGHTED RANKS. SO YOU MAY REMEMBER SOME ACTIONS IN THE PLAN ARE NOT -- THEY ARE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION CAPACITY WAS NOT CALCULATED BECAUSE THEY WERE CONSIDERED FOUNDATIONAL TO THE WORK WE WERE DOING AND SO IN A CASE SUCH AS THAT, THE CRITERION FOR GREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION WAS ZEROED OUT. SO IT WAS WEIGHTED AGAINST ALL OTHER CRITERION SO WE COULD HAVE AN APPLES TO APPLES DIFFERENCE. THIS IS HOW THE PRIORITIZATION FRAMEWORK WORKS. BUT IF WE WENT BACK TO THE GOVERNANCE MODEL, WHAT I WANT TO POINT OUT IS THAT WE ARE PROPOSING THAT EVERY ACTION THAT'S PROPOSED THROUGH OUR ENGAGEMENT ACTIVITIES, GOES THROUGH THE PRIORITIZATION FRAMEWORK. THAT WAY WE ARE CONSISTENT IN HOW WE PRESENT AND RECOMMEND ACTIONS MOVING FORWARD. THE NEXT DOCUMENT WE HAVE IS THE INVESTMENT PLAN AND I WILL GO AHEAD AND SHARE THIS HERE. I WILL TRY NOT TO TOGGLE BACK AND FORTH. THANK YOU FOR YOUR FLEXIBILITY AS WE ADAPT ON THE SPOT WITH THE TECHNOLOGY AND MY LIMITATIONS WITH IT. SO THE THIRD SET OF MATERIALS IS THE INVESTMENT PLAN. THIS INCLUDES TWO DOCUMENTS AND I WILL SHOW THEM HERE. THE FIRST IS A COVER MEMO, WHICH SUMMARIZES THE INVESTMENT PLAN ITSELF. THIS INCLUDES A DESCRIPTION HERE OF HOW THE DOCUMENT IS FRAMED, AND WE POINT OUT THAT MANY OF THE STRATEGIES AND THE SPECIFIC ACTIONS HAVE ECONOMIC BENEFITS THAT ARE EQUAL TO, IF NOT MORE THAN THE INITIAL COST OF THE ACTION BEING IMPLEMENTED. THAT'S THE REASON WE PIVOTED FROM A FUNDING PLAN TO AN INVESTMENT PLAN. NOW, THAT'S NOT TRUE ACROSS THE BOARD FOR EVERY ACTION, BUT THERE ARE POINTS AND WE TRY TO CALL THEM OUT. WE DO THIS IN THE INVESTMENT PLAN AS WELL, AND WHEN T THERE E EXPECTED SAVINGS TO A RESIDENT, OR THE CITY ITSELF. SECONDLY, THE PLAN INTRODUCES ONE POSSIBLE INVESTMENT SCENARIOS AND I WILL SHOW THAT IN A MOMENT IN MUCH GREATER DETAIL. HERE IN THE DOCUMENT, AUTOSOAT STHEASSUMPTIONS AND THK ABOUT THAT INVESTMENT SCENARIO AND WHAT THAT MEANS IN GREATER DEPTH. THE DOCUMENT PROPOSES THAT WE CREATE A THREE-YEAR SLIDING FINANCIAL PLAN THAT WOULD BE REVISITED EVERY TWO YEARS TO REMAIN UP TO DATE AND MORE RESPONSIVE TO CHANGES THAT OCCUR IN FEDERAL, STATE AND PHILANTHROPIC INTERESTS AND NEW INNOVATIVE AND NEW PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS THAT MAY EMERGE. AND WHAT IS NICE ABOUT THIS POTENTIAL PROPOSAL IS THAT IT WOULD KEEP THIS FUNDING PLAN AND INVESTMENT PLAN IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE CITY'S BUDGET. SO THE TWO OF THEM CAN BE REVISITED TOGETHER. AND THEN LASTLY, THE DOCUMENT LOOKS AT THE COST OF -- APPLIES A SOCIAL COST OF CARBON TO THE HISTORIC COMMISSIONS FROM 2000 TO 2018 IN THE CITY, AND ALSO LOOKS AT THE SOCIAL COST OF CARBON ASSOCIATED WITH OUR ACTIVITIES OVER THE INTERCEDING YEARS AS WE WORK TO GET TO CARBON NEUTRALITY. FINALLY, IT CALCULATES WHAT THE SOCIAL VALUE WILL BE WHEN WE DO ACHIEVE COMMUNITY-WIDE CARBON NEUTRALITY. SO THE LAST DOCUMENT I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU, AGAIN AGAIN, THS IN YOUR PACKET IS THE INVESTMENT SCENARIO THIS DOCUMENT IS HARD TO READ. I WILL GO AHEAD AND BLOW THIS UP FOR YOU. AND I'M SURE THAT'S PROBABLY STILL VERY CHALLENGING. IT IS IN YOUR PACKET, OF COURSE. BUT I JUST THINK IT'S WORTH WHILE TO TALK FOR A SECOND TO TALK ABOUT THIS DOCUMENT WHAT WE HAVE IN THIS DOCUMENT IS EACH PROPOSED ACTION, THAT IS IN THE CARBON NEUTRALITY STRATEGY THAT THE CITY IS RESPONSIBLE. AND FOR EACH ACTION, THE TOP ROW LISTS THE ACTION. HERE'S THE CUMULATIVE COST THAT'S IN THE PLAN AND THEN THE COST PER YEAR, AS ESTIMATED IN THE GREENHOUSE GAS SCENARIO THAT WE DEVELOPED FOR THE -- THAT UNDERLINED CARBON NEUTRALITY. NEXT, WHAT WE HAVE IN -- AND EVERY ACTION IS FRAMED AND FORMATTED EXACTLY THE SAME. SO TALKING THROUGH ONE, IT REPEATS ITSELF THROUGH THE STRUCTURE AND I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A SPECIAL THANKS TO ADMINISTRATOR CRAWFORD FOR ALL OF HIS HELP AS WE WORK THROUGH THIS DOCUMENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IN THE DOCUMENT ITSELF, FOR EACH ROW, THE VERY FIRST ROW LOOKS AT OPERATIONAL COST TO THE CITY. SO IN THIS CASE, THIS IS ALL STAFFING-RELATED COSTS IN THE VERY FIRST YEARS ESTIMATED TO START A COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATION PROGRAM. THE SECOND ROW CALCULATES IF THERE'S ANY COST SAVINGS OR ADDITIONAL COSTS, ADDITIONAL COSTS TO THE CITY. AND YOU CAN SEE IN LATTER YEARS WE PROJECT THAT A CCA WILL ACTUALLY SAVE THE CITY MONEY. SO THI THERE'S A CREDIT. THE NEXT LINE PROJECTS THE DEBT SERVICE AND SO IF THE CITY WAS PROJECTING THAT WE WOULD TAKE OUT DEBT, TO FINANCE THE GIVEN ACTION, I WORKED WITH ADMINISTRATOR CRAWFORD TO CALCULATE WHAT THAT DEBT SERVICE WOULD BE. THEN THE NEXT IS THE NET CITY IMPACT AND THAT'S THE CUMULATIVE COST OF THESE ACTIONS THAT ARE BEFORE IT. NEXT YOU WOULD SEE CITY CAPITAL. THIS IS NOT MATHEMATICALLY TIED IN -- YOU WOULD NOT SUM THIS UP BUT THIS IS THE AMOUNT OF DEBT THAT WE WOULD PROPOSE TAKING OUT IN THIS PARTICULAR INVESTMENT SCENARIO IF THIS WAS DEBT BEING INVESTIGATED AS A POSSIBLE SOLUTION. NEXT, WE LOOK AT THE FUND THAT WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR BEARING THE COST OF THE ACTIONS. AND THEN THE LAST ROW LOOKS AT ANY POTENTIAL OUTSIDE SOURCES. SO WHETHER THAT'S GRANT DOLLARS OR STATE AND FEDERAL SUPPORT OR PRO BONO ASSISTANCE ARE PARTNER SUPPORT BECAUSE AN ACTION ALIGNS WITH THE WORK PLANS OR OBJECTIVES OR A PRIVATE/PUBLIC PARTNERSHIP. THESE ARE PROJECTED IN THE LAST ROW. IN THE BLUE BOX IS AN ESTIMATE OF WHAT IS INCLUDED IN EXISTING CITY BUDGE E BUDGETS BECAUSE ITT OF EXISTING WORK PLANS OR AS IN THE FISCAL '20-21 B21 BUDGET IT. WE PROVIDE INFORMATION, IF THERE'S A PAYBACK OR IF WE ESTIMATED SAVINGS WHY WERE WE ESTIMATING SAVINGS AND IF WE TOOK OUT ANY DEBT WE PROVIDE THE TERMS OF THAT DEBT. FOR EXAMPLE, YOU MIGHT SEE A 20-YEAR TERM WITH A 4% RATE. FOR EVERY ACTION, THIS IS INCLUDED AND THEN AT THE BOTT. TO OF THE DOCUMENT, THIS IS -- AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DOCUMENT, IT'S AVAILABLE IN EXCEL. AGAIN, THIS IS SOMETHING THAT CAN BE CHANGED AND EDITED. WE WENT AND PDFED IT FOR KEEPING CONSISTENCY ACROSS THE BOO. AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DOCUMENT IS THE AGGREGATION. SO THIS SUMS ALL OF THOSE ROWS. THESE ARE THE EXACT SAME ROWS YOU SEE AGGREGATED ACROSS EACH YEAR. AND THIS GIVES US A CUMULATIVE COST FOR THE PLAN. SO AS OUTLINED IN THE PREVIOUS DOCUMENT, THIS INVESTMENT SCENARIO, THIS IS JUST ONE POSSIBLE INVESTMENT SCENARIO AMONGST MANY. THERE ARE MANY SOURCES OF FUNDING. THERE'S NEW OPPORTUNITIES THAT COULD BE EMERGING, BUT THIS IS ONE SCENARIO THAT WE PUT FORWARD. WE HAVE FAR MORE CLARITY IN THE NEAR YEARS, MEANING YEARS ONE, TWO, AND THREE, THAN WE DO IN LATTER YEARS, OF COURSE. AND GIVEN THAT, STAFF RECOMMENDS THAT WE DO CREATE A THREE-YEAR INVESTMENT PLAN, WHICH CAN PROVIDE THAT GREATER DIRECTION AND CLARITY IN THE NEAR TERM AND ALLOW US TO ALIGN WITH THE CITY'S BUDGET AS WE UPDATE THAT EVERY TWO YEARS. SO LET ME GO AHEAD AND JUST GO BACK IF POSSIBLE TOWARDS THE END. SO I'M GOING TO JUST GO FORWARD HERE -- THE LAST TWO SLIDES ROUNDS OUT THIS INFORMATION. THIS PRESENTS THE TIMING FOR MANY OF THE THINGS I TALKED THROUGH. I KNOW THIS WAS FAST AND FURIOUS. SO WHAT WE'RE SHOWING IN THIS TABLE ARE THE NUMBER OF ACTIVITIES THAT ARE ONGOING, WHEN WE PROPOSE MAKING REVISIONS TO VARIOUS DOCUMENTS, AND HOW -- HOW ALL OF THIS TALLS TOGETHER BROADLY SPEAKING. SO YOU WILL SEE MANY THINGS ARE ONGOING. REGULAR COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT, REPORTS TO COUNCIL, REPORTING OF SUSTAINABILITY DASHBOARD, AS SOON AS IT'S ONLINE. THEY WILL CONTINUALLY HAPPEN. THERE ARE THINGS THAT WILL HAPPEN ANNUALLY, LIKE OUR ANNUAL SUMMIT OR ANNUAL SURVEY AND THEN THERE ARE THINGS ON A PROPOSED TWO-YEAR CYCLE WHICH INCLUDES UPDATES AND REVISIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE REALLY THE MOST APPROPRIATE DOUBTS. SO UPDATING AT THIS INTERVAL WE THINK WILL PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY TO HOLISTICALLY EVALUATE THE SUCCESSES, THE LIMITATIONS AND THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVEMENT IN ALL THE WORK THAT WE ARE DOING. SO FINALLY, I WANTED TO ADDRESS THE RESOLUTION THAT'S BEFORE YOU TONIGHT. IN YOUR APRIL 20th RESOLUTION, R2138, COUNCIL DIRECTED A2ZERO CARBON NEUTRALITY FOR FURTHER CONSIDERATION WHEN THE FUNDING PLAN AND PRIORITIZATION FRAMEWORK HAD BEEN DEVELOPED. A RESOLUTION TO THAT EFFECT IS ON THE AGENDA TONIGHT. ONE NOTABLE DISTINCTION THAT I WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT IS STAFF ARE RECOMMENDING THAT WE FOCUS ON SUPPORTING THE SEVEN OVERARCHING STRATEGIES LISTED ON THIS SLIDE AS OPPOSED TO FOCUSING ON SUPPORTING ALL 44 ACTIONS OUTLINED IN THE PLAN. THE REASON FOR THIS IS THAT THE STRATEGIES ARE FOUNDATIONAL TO THE CARBON NEUTRALITY PLAN AND LESS LIKELY TO CHANGE. THE ACTIONS, HOWEVER, WILL UNDOUBTEDLY CHANGE AS WE MOVE FORWARD. SUCH STAFF RECOMMENDS THAT WE FOCUS ON THE PILLARS OF THE WORK, THE STRATEGIES AS WE LOOK TO MOVE FORWARD. AND FINALLY BEFORE CLOSING OUT MY TIME. I WANTED TO DISCUSS THE CURRENT FISCAL ASSOCIATION WITH COVID AND THE WORK OF OUR OFFICE. THE CURRENT SITUATION NECESSITIES THAT EVERY DEPARTMENT LOOKS AT WAY TO SAVE RESOURCES AND FOCUS ON THE MISSION OF THE CITY. OSI IS PART OF THAT DISCUSSION. WORKING WITH THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR WE INCLUDED MANY OF THOSE COST MIFF SAVING STRATEGIES IN THE MAY MAY 11th FINANCIAL RECOVERY PLAN PRESENTATION THAT ADMINISTRATOR CRAWFORD DELIVERED LAST WEEK. THAT INCLUDED THINGS LIKE NOT HIRING A FELLOW, NOT HIRING SUMMER INTERNS AND FALL INTERNS. DELAYING ENERGY AUDITS AT THE CITY, NOT MOVING THE INTERNAL CASH OP TAX FORWARD. AND CUTTING TRAINING DOLLARS WITHIN OUR BUDGET. AND I JUST ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT OUR BUDGET IS SMALLER THAN OTHER UNITS AND SO THOSE WERE THE MAGNITUDES OF CUTS THAT OUR OFFICE PROPOSED AND WE CONTINUED TO WORK WITH ADMINISTRATOR CRAWFORD AND OTHERS TO SURE UP THE SITUATION THAT WE ARE. ININ ADDITION, OSI ISREQUESTINGE EQUIVALENTS IN THIS FISCAL YEAR. IF APPROVED THOSE WOULD BE UNDER THE PROPOSED HIRING FREEZE BY THE ADMINISTRATOR AND WOULD BE SUBJECT TO HIS DISCRETION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT TO ACTUALLY POST AND MOVE FORWARD WITH HIRING. SINCE OSI IS NOT A SERVICE AREA WITHIN THE CITY, BUT IT'S IN THE ADMINISTRATOR'S OFFICE, WE WERE NOT CALLED OUT IN LAST WEEK'S BUDGET PRESENTATION IN THE SAME WAY OUR PEERS IN PUBLIC SERVICE MIGHT HAVE BEEN. SO I WANTED TO MAKE IT EXPLICIT THAT OSI AND ALL UNITS IN THE CITY ARE LOOKING AT WAYS TO SAVE RESOURCES FOR THE CITY, WHILE ALSO STAYING FOCUSED ON OUR MISSION. WITH, THAT I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND FOR EVERYTHING YOU ARE DOING FOR OUR COMMUNITY. THANK YOU.
00:24:54.702: >> City Admin. Crawford: MAYOR, MAY I MAKE A COMMENT. DR. STULTS, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO MAKE A COMMENT ON THIS, BUT I BELIEVE ON THE SLIDE, ON THE INVESTMENT SCENARIO, IT SHOWED IN '21 DEBT ISSUANCES OF $42 MILLION AND THEN ANOTHER AMOUNT IN '22, DID YOU WANT TO COMMENT ON WHY IT DISPLAYS THAT WAY?
00:25:10.818: >> YES, IN THE INVESTMENT SCENARIO THAT WE PUT FORWARD, WE FRONT LOADED ALL THE WORK FOR '21 AND '22, AGAIN, WE ANTICIPATE THAT WILL CHANGE GIVEN THE SITUATION THAT WE ARE IN RIGHT NOW, BUT THAT THE SCENARIO THAT WE RAN WAS FRONT LOADING ALL THE DEBT THAT WE MIGHT POSSIBLY ACCUMULATE IN THE FIRST FEW YEARS.
00:25:30.905: >> City Admin. Crawford: SO THAT TAKES ALL THE PROJECTS THAT REQUIRE FINANCING AND ASSUMES IT'S IN '21. NO PROJECT WOULD MOVE FORWARD REQUIRING FINANCING WITHOUT PROJECT COMING FORWARD TO COUNCIL SEPARATELY? JUST SO COUNCIL IS AWARE.
00:25:48.089: >> Mayor Taylor: ALL RIGHT. VERY GOOD. THANK YOU, DR. STULTS. WE NOW COME TO PUBLIC COMMENT RESERVE TIME. PUBLIC COMMENT RESERVE TIME IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO SPEAK TO COUNCIL AND THE COMMUNITY ABOUT MATTERS OF MUNICIPAL INTEREST. TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT RESERVE TIME, ONE NEEDS TO HAVE SIGNED UP IN ADVANCE. SPEAKERS WILL HAVE -- TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT RESERVE TIME, UNDER CURRENT CONDITIONS, PLEASE CALL 877-853-5247 OR 8888-788-0099 AND ENTER THE MEETING CODE, 991-6815-0141. THIS IS THE NUMBER YOU SHOULD SEE OPEN YOUR SCREEN. SPEAKERS HAVE FOUR MINUTES IN WHICH TO SPEAK. PLEASE PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE CLERK. THE CLERK WILL ANNOUNCE WHEN 30 SECONDS -- PARDON ME, WHEN YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS REMAINING. WHEN YOUR TIME IS UP, YOU WILL BE PLACED ON MUTE AND WE WILL ON TO THE NEXT SPEAKER. THE SPEAKERS WILL BE CALLED ON BY ME, AND THEN THE CITY CLERK, USING LAST THREE DIGITS OF YOUR PHONE NUMBER. YOU WILL HEAR AN AUTOMATED ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE HOST IS ALLOWING YOU TO SPEAK. WHEN YOU SPEAK, PLEASE MOVE TO A QUIET AREA AND MUTE ANY TV OR BACKGROUND NOISE. OUR FIRST SPEAKER TODAY IS EILEEN TYLER.
00:27:18.412: >> OKAY. I'M UNMUTED. OKAY. IT'S ILENE TYLER.
00:27:26.187: >> Mayor Taylor: I'M SORRY.
00:27:28.355: >> THAT'S OKAY. EVERYONE GETS MY NAME WRONG. I LIVE AT 126 NORTH DIVISION STREET. SO I'M PROBABLY CLOSER TO CITY HALL AT THIS POINT THAN ANY OF YOU ARE, BUT THAT SAID, I WANTED TO PROVIDE MY COMMENTS IN THE MATTER THAT YOU ARE EXPECTING THEM AND I HAVE DRAFTED OUT A STATEMENT SO I WILL READ IT QUICKLY. I SET MY OWN TIMER SO I KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. OKAY. SO QUOTING FROM MIKE GARFIELD OF THE ECOLOGY CENTER. WE ARE STILL IN THE MIDST OF A LONG-TERM CLIMATE EMERGENCY AND COULD CITY COUNCIL DECLARED A CLIMATE EMERGENCY IN DECEMBER OF 2019 IN THE WORK TO ADDRESS THE EMERGENCY MUST CONTINUE. WHILE EVERYONE IS CONCERNED ABOUT THE ECONOMY, ESPECIALLY NOW, DUE TO IMPACTS OF THE CORONAVIRUS. WE WON'T MAKE OUR STEP. ENDORSE A2ZERO IS IMPORTANT AND I URGE YOU TO GIVE IT UNANIMOUS SUPPORT TONIGHT. WE REALLY NEED A PLAN IN PLACE TO GUIDE AND PRIORITIZE FUTURE DECISIONS. THE OVERARCHING STRATEGIES ARE VERY IMPORTANT. I'M COMFORTABLE WITH THOSE AND WILL RELY ON THE PROCESS TO NEGOTIATE THE ID  INDIVIDUAL ACS THAT COME LATER. I PARTICIPATED IN SEVERAL OF THE PARTNERING MEETINGS, AND THE TOWN HALL AND I'M VERY IMPRESSED WITH STAFF AND IN SUPPORT OF MY FELLOW CITIZENS. MY INPUT MATTERED ENOUGH THAT MY CONCERNS IN THE DISTRICTS WERE INCORPORATED INTO THE FINAL DOCUMENT OF THE PLAN. I KNOW THERE'S STILL MUCH TO DO AND I SUBMIT TO CONTINUING MY PARTICIPATION IN THE PROCESS, DOING WHAT I CAN TO RAISE AWARENESS AND TREATING THIS AS A CRISIS THAT IS. MOST IMPORTANT COROLLARY IN THE PROCESS IS, IN MY MIND, APPROVAL OF THE MASTER PLAN. WITHOUT THAT, WE DON'T KNOW REALLY WHERE WE WANT TO BE CHANGING THINGS AS IMPORTANT AND AS SIGNIFICANT AS ZONING AND THEN LEADING TO PRIORITIZING FUTURE BUDGETS. FOR THOSE WHO KNOW ME, YOU KNOW I'M A PRESERVATION HIT. IST. I LIVE IN AN HISTORIC HOUSE, BUT I'M AN INDEPENDENT VOICE AND A STRONG ADVOCATE FOR COMMUNITY DIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION AND WE NEED TO ACT WITH INFORMED CONFIDENCE AS WE ENVISION THE STRONGER, SAFER AND HEALTHIER COMMUNITY. CHANGES HAPPENING ALL AROUND US. MY HOPE IS THAT WE HAVE THE STRENGTH TO EMBRACE IT WITH KINDNESS.
00:30:00.174: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
00:30:04.745: >> I THINK I'M DONE. YES.
00:30:10.217: >> Mayor Taylor: ALL RIGHT.
00:30:11.518: >> MY LAST WORD AND IT CUT ME OFF. I'M ASSUMING I'M DONE. THAT'S OKAY.
00:30:17.057: >> Mayor Taylor: I THINK THAT WAS A 30-SECOND WARNING BUT IF YOU ARE -- IF YOU ARE DONE, YOU ARE DONE. THANK YOU, MS. TYLER. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS KATHLEEN MURPHEY.
00:30:37.044: >> GOOD EVENING, CITY COUNCILMEMBERS. GOOD EVENING, MAYOR TAYLOR. I WROTE YOU ALL ABOUT A MONTH AGO, JUST BEFORE DR. MISSY STULTS WAS TO PRESENT THE DRAFT FORM OF THE A2ZERO PROJECT. I WHOLEHEARTEDLY SUPPORTED IT THEN AND I STILL DO. MY ARGUMENT BOILS DOWN TO ONE CENTRAL POINT. IF WE DON'T COMMIT TO REACHING CARBON NEUTRALITY FOR 2030, AND INVESTING NOW IN THE COSTS RELATED TO, THAT OUR TIME OF EMERGENCIES WILL BE MUCH, MUCH GREATER IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS, AND THUS MUCH HARDER TO DEAL WITH BY 2030. AND THE COST THEN WILL BE ASTRONOMICAL. WE NEED TO INVEST NOW, AND BUILD ON THE EXCELLENT FOUNDATION THAT THE A2ZERO TEAM HAS CONSTRUCTED FOR US. IT SE SEEMS PRECARIOUS TO ME THT YOU SHOULD INVEST  IN THE CITY'S FUTURE AND INVESTING IN THE A2ZERO. AND AT A TIME WHEN OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SEEMS SLACKING IN THE LEADERSHIP TO DEAL EFFECTIVELY WITH MAJOR ISSUES OUR COUNTRY IS FACING SUCH AS THE COVID-19 HEALTH CRISIS, AS WELL AS THE MANY CRISES IT HAS SPAWNED JUST AS JOBLESSNESS, HOMELESSNESS, AND FOOD BANK LINES, IT IS ALSO REGRESSIVELY TRYING TO FURTHER INVEST IN FOSSIL FUEL TECHNOLOGIES INSTEAD OF GREEN TECHNOLOGIES AND ROLLING BACK REGULATIONS MEANT TO PROTECT OUR HEALTH AND SAFETY, AND THE HEALTH AND THE LIVABILITY OF OUR PLANET. WITH SUCH A DO NOTHING GOOD, THAT GOVERNMENT AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL, I BELIEVE THE FUTURE OF PROGRESSIVE POLICY INITIATIVES WILL HAVE TO COME FROM THE LOCAL LEVEL. THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR IS UNIQUELY POISED TO LEAD IN THIS ARENA. TO PASS AND INVEST IN THE A2 ZERO PLAN WOULD PUT THE ANN ARBOR CITY COUNCIL IN WITH THE QUOTE LEADERS AND BEST, UNQUOTE OF THE STATE AND THE COUNTRY. I IMPLORE YOU TO SUPPORT THE A2ZERO PLAN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
00:32:54.415: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS ELIJAH KAPCHER-KAY.
00:33:05.192: >> THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE MY PERSPECTIVE WITH YOU, MEMBERS OF COUNCIL AND MAYOR TAYLOR. I'M A WARD 5 RESIDENT AND FRESHMAN AT PIONEER HIGH SCHOOL AND I'M SPEAKING TONIGHT IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE A2ZERO LIVING CARBON NEUTRALITY PLAN. I SUPPORT FULL FUNDING FOR THE OFFICE OF SUSTAINABILITY AND INNOVATION AS PROPOSED IN THE INTERIM ADMINISTRATOR'S BUDGET, WHICH WOULD ALLOW US TO BEGIN IMPLEMENTING ITS PLAN AND ADDRESSING THE LOOMING CLIMATE CRISIS. AS I MENTIONED, I'M A YOUNG PERSON, I'M 15 YEARS OLD. I HAVE A WHOLE LIFETIME TO LOOK FORWARD TO ON THIS PLANET, HOPEFULLY HERE IN ANN ARBOR. WHEN I DID LOOK FORWARD, I CAN'T BE VERY EXCITED OR HOPEFUL FOR THE FUTURE. WHAT I SEE THERE IS CLIMATE CHANGE. I HAVE ALREADY SEEN IT RIGHT HERE IN OUR COMMUNITY, WHETHER IT TAKES THE FORM OF SEVERE BLOODING IN WESTERN WASHTENAW OR EXTREME HEAT IN TOWN. IT WILL GET WORSE UNLESS WE TAKE ACTION. THAT'S TERRIFYING, BUT IT'S ALSO MOTIVATING. I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW THIS, BECAUSE YOU DECLARED A CLIMATE -- (NO AUDIO). THAT SHOWED FORESIGHT AND IT SHOWED COURAGE AND I'M GRATEFUL. IF ONLY THOSE WORDS ARE -- EVEN THOSE RESOLUTIONS AND COMMITMENTS WERE ENOUGH, BUT UNFORTUNATELY, THEY ARE NOT. THEY MUST BE BACKED BY ACTION. IN NOVEMBER, YOU ASKED CITY STAFF TO DEVELOP A PLAN FOR THAT ACTION AND THE OFFICE OF SUSTAINABILITY AND INNOVATIONS ROSE TO THE CHALLENGE BEAUTIFULLY. I READ THE PLAN. IT NOT ONLY CHAMPIONS BE ARE THE BOLD AMBITIOUS ACTION NECESSARY TO CONFRONT THE CLIMATE CRISIS HEAD ON BUT ALSO DETAILS COMMUNITY-CENTERED PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE YOUTH AMBASSADOR PROGRAM, WHICH I'M A PARTICULAR FAN OF, THAT WE NEED TO SUSTAIN ANN ARBOR FAR INTO THE FUTURE. WE ARE, OF COURSE, ALSO FACING CORONAVIRUS IN ADDITION TO CLIMATE CHANGE. THIS DISEASE HAS TAKEN ITS TOLL ON MY FAMILY ALREADY, AND I WILL BE FIRST TO SAY THAT WE MUST FIGHT IT AS A UNIFIED COMMUNITY AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE FUND ECONOMIC RELIEF. BUT WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF ANOTHER LONG-TERM EMERGENCY AS YOU WISELY DECLARED LAST NOVEMBER. WITH HE CANNOT ALLOW CORONAVIRUS TO FORCE US TO DROP THE BALL ON CLIMATE JUSTICE AND CLIMATE FUNDING. INSTEAD, WE MUST LEARN FROM THIS DISEASE. WE MUST LEARN WHAT A CRISIS CAN DO TO OUR COMMUNITY AND IF IT SHOWS US ANYTHING, IT'S THAT WE MUST STOP THIS. WE MUST DO THIS BY ADOPTING AND FUNDING THE A2ZERO PLAN. THE PLAN IS NOT JUST A BOLD PROPOSAL WE NEED TO CHART A COURSE OUT OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS, BUT IT IS MORE JUST SUSTAINABLE, RESILIENCE AND LIVABLE COMMUNITY AS WE BEGIN TO EMERGE FROM THE DEVASTATION OF CORONAVIRUS, LET'S NOT BE SATISFIED WITH A RETURN TO THE OLD NORMAL. INSTEAD, IT'S TIME TO CRAFT APRIL INTEREST --
00:35:50.324: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
00:35:50.958: >> AND IT'S TIME TO SAVE THE PLANET WHILE WE ARE AT IT. THE CITY STAFF HAVE A PLAN FOR THAT. NOW IT'S YOUR TURN TO STEP UP AND FULLY ADOPT AND FUND THE CARBON NEUTRALITY PLAN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND HAVE A WONDERFUL EVENING.
00:36:02.836: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS LAURA RUBIN.
00:36:10.911: >> HI, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
00:36:12.112: >> Mayor Taylor: YOU BET.
00:36:13.180: >> GOOD EVENING, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
00:36:16.049: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
00:36:16.550: >> HI, MY NAME IS LAURA RUBIN. I LIVE AT 625 FOUNTAIN STREET? ANN ARBOR. AND FOR THE LAST 25 YEARS, I HAVE WORKED IN THE WILL REGION, PROTECTING CLEAN WATER AND THE ENVIRONMENT. TONIGHT, I'M SPEAKING FOR THE ANN ARBOR CLIMATE PARTNERSHIP. THE ANN ARBOR CLIMATE PARTNERSHIP INCLUDES 18 COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS, REPRESENTING OVER 10,000 PEOPLE, WHO ARE ALL SUPPORTING THE CITY'S CLIMATE PLAN AND FUNDING. WE HAVE OVER 600 PEOPLE WHO HAVE SIGNED A POSITION IN SUPPORT OF THE CLIMATE'S NEUTRALITY PLAN AND PROPOSED FUNDING AND I HOPE YOU HAVE SEEN THEIR SUPPORT ON THE SIGNS WE HAVE MADE THAT ARE POPPING UP ALL OVER TIME. BUT THE CLIMATE PARTNERSHIP STARTED NEARLY 10 YEARS AGO AND I WAS ONE THAT WAS PART OF THE COMMITTEE THAT ASSISTED THE CITY IN DRAFTING ITS EXISTING CLIMATE ACTION PLAN. WHILE IT WAS A TERRIFIC PLAN FOR ITS TIME, ITS IMPLEMENTATION HAS FALLEN SHORT BECAUSE THE CITY FAILED TO PRIORITIZE FUNDING FOR THAT WORK UNTIL VERY RECENTLY. THE RECENT CITY CLIMATE EMERGENCY DECLARATION HAS HELPED TO ELEVATE THE CLIMATE ISSUE THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY AND IS BUILT HAS GROWING CONSENSUS BEHIND THE NEW CARBON NEUTRALITY PLAN. SO THANK YOU FOR THAT. EVEN IF THE PLAN IS NOT PERFECT, IT'S STILL AN AWESOME PATH FORWARD AND IT'S A PLAN WITH A GROWING CONSENSUS BEHIND IT. BUT IF THIS CURRENT COVID CRISIS HAS TAUGHT US ANYTHING, IT'S THAT ONE, WE NEED STRONG LEADERSHIP. TWO, WE NEED TO LISTEN TO SCIENCE. AND THREE, WE NEED TO PREPARE. BAD THINGS CAN HAPPEN AND WE CAN BE READY FOR THEM. AND THAT WE CAN HANDLE A PROBLEM MUCH BETTER WHEN WE PREPARE. THAT HAS A PLAN AND IT HAS FUNDING BEHIND IT. SO NO MATTER HOW GOOD THE CARBON NEUTRALITY PLAN MAY BE WITHOUT FUNDING, IT'S NOT WORTH THE CLOUD THAT IT'S STORED IN. SO TONIGHT, I URGE YOU TO PUT YOUR FINANCIAL SUPPORT BEHIND THIS PLAN. THE PLAN HAS BROAD COMMUNITY SUPPORT. I HAVE TO SAY THAT HAVING WORKED WITH CITY STAFF FOR THE PAST 20 YEARS, THIS CARBON NEUTRALITY PLAN AND THE MONTHLY REPORTS THAT COME OUT OF THE OSI OFFICE ARE THE MOST RESEARCHED, TRACKED, DOCUMENTED AND REPORTED ON ANY CITY EFFORT I HAVE SEEN. SO OUR COMMUNITY NEEDS TO WALK ITS TALK ABOUT CARBON NEUTRALITY. IF COUNCIL SUPPORTS THE PLAN, AND PRIOR PRIORITIZES ITS FUNDIE WILL MEET OUR MOMENT IN ANN ARBOR. WHEN THE COVID CRISIS STOPS WE CAN'T WAIT FOR THE SHORT-TERM CRISIS TO BE OVER TO START PLANNING FOR THE NEXT ONE.
00:38:46.466: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
00:38:47.167: >> THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. GOOD NIGHT.
00:38:50.070: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS BENTLEY JOHNSON.
00:38:56.777: >> THANK YOU, MAYOR. THANK YOU SO MUCH, MAYOR TAYLOR. COUNCILMEMBERS, DR. MISSY STULTS AND TEAM, IT'S REALLY A PLEASURE TO BE HERE. I'M BENTLEY. I'M THE SENIOR PARTNERSHIPS MANAGER FOR THE MICHIGAN LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS, MICHIGAN LCV BUT I'M A RESIDENT OF THE NORTH SIDE, AND REALLY, I'M SPEAKING FIRST AND FOREMOST AS A RESIDENT, AND I WANT TO START BY SAY THANK YOU FOR VOTING TO MAKE ANN ARBOR CARBON NEUTRAL BY 2030. WE NEED A PLAN AND ADEQUATE RESOURCES TO GET US THERE AND I BELIEVE WE HAVE THAT PLAN AND PROPOSAL IN FRONT OF YOU TODAY. IT'S AMBITIOUS, BUT I REALLY BELIEVE IT'S DOABLE AND IT MEETS THE SCALE OF THE CHALLENGE. AND WITH, YOU KNOW -- WITH IT BEING A LIVING DOCUMENT, AND HAVING A GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE THAT WE CAN -- RESIDENTS AND DECISION MAKERS CAN COME TOGETHER TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO MAKE IT WORK FOR OUR -- FOR OUR CITY AND I'M REALLY PROUD OF LIVING IN ANN ARBOR AND LIVING IN MICHIGAN. I WORK AROUND THE NORTH SIDE A LOT WITH MY TWO KIDS AND I SEE RAIN BARRELS AND VICTORY GARDENS AND SOLAR PANELS, PEOPLE STILL TAKING THE BUS AND RIDING BIKES AND FUEL-EFFICIENT VEHICLES WITH SOME OF THE INTHA INFAMOUS BUMPR STICKERS THAT WE HAVE WE ARE SOME OF THE MOST CIVICALLY ENGAGED AND ENVIRONMENTAL ORIENTS PEOPLE. ON THOSE SIGNS, YOU KNOW, IT SAYS UNDERNEATH CLIMATE VOTER IT SAYS HEALTH JUSTICE COMMUNITY. THESE VALUES THAT I KNOW WE ALL HOLD DEAR AND THAT I SEE AT THE CENTER OF THE A2ZERO STRATEGY WITH THIS FOCUS ON EQUITY AND SUSTAINABILITY. I KNOW WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE COST OF COVID, AND -- BUT WE CAN'T AFFORD NOT TO TACKLE CLIMATE AND BUILD RESILIENCY AND IF ANYTHING THIS CRISIS HAS TAUGHT US THAT AIR POLLUTION AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL THREATS LEAVES PEOPLE MORE VULNERABLE TO COVID AND OTHER HEALTH PROBLEMS. WE NEED TO DO OUR PART. AT LCV, WE ARE ALWAYS TRYING TO THINK OF WHAT'S ON VOTEERS' MINDS AND CLIMATE CHANGE IS ON VOTERS' MINDS. WE DID A POLL AROUND THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION FOR PRESIDENT. WE FOUND IN MICHIGAN 79% OF THE LIKELY PRIMARY VOTER SAID IT'S PERSONALLY IMPORTANT TO THEM THAT THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT HAVE A PLAN FOR ADDRESSING THE CLIMATE CHANGE CRISIS AND MOVING THE US TO 100% CLEAN ECONOMY. SO VOTERS HAVE BEEN THERE SUPPORTING THIS. THEY WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO. I WILL DO MY PART TO EDUCATE MY AREA. WE HAVE SOME OF THE STRONGEST STATE REPRESENTATIVES AND SENATOR ON CLEAN ENERGY AND CLIMATE, OUR US REPRESENTATIVE, DEBBIE DINGLE AND OUR U.S. SENATORS ARE TEAMING TOGETHER TO PUT FORWARD 100% CLEAN ENERGY BILL.
00:41:57.490: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
00:41:58.124: >> AND SO ON AND SO FORTH. SO WITH ALL OF THIS MOMENTUM, I WOULD BE REALLY DISAPPOINTED IF MY OWN CITY COUNCIL MISSED A KEY OPPORTUNITY. AND PLEASE APPROVE THIS PLAN AND LET'S WORK TOGETHER TO SHAPE AND IMPLEMENT IT AND BRING THIS COMMUNITY TOGETHER AROUND EQUITY, SUSTAINABILITY AND BE PART OF THE MOVEMENT TO SAVE THE PLANET FOR THE FUTURE GENERATION. THANK YOU.
00:42:20.647: >> Clerk Beaudry: TIME.
00:42:21.181: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS CLARK McCALL.
00:42:33.927: >> MY, MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL. I'M A RESIDENT IN THE SECOND WARD. I'M HERE AS A CITIZEN, TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF FULLY SUPPORTING THE CLIMATE ACTION PLAN TO HAVE ANN ARBOR BE CARBON NEUTRAL BY 2030. COUNCIL SHOULD APPROVE THE INTERIM MANAGER'S BUDGET AND ADDRESS THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 CRISIS, AS THOSE IMPACTS BECOME BETTER KNOWN. IF WE SUPPORT THE CLIMATE ACTION FUNDING, THAT CAN LEAD TO SUPPORT FOR CITY STAFF, WHO CAN THEN WORK TO STAPP INTO FEDERAL STIMULUS FUNDS THAT CAN BE USED TO IMPLEMENT THE CLIMATE PLAN. THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR IS A LEADER. WE PRIDE OURSELVES ON THAT. WHAT ARE THE NEXT STEPS ON THE PATH TO CONTINUED LEADERSHIP. REFOCUSING OUR BUDGET ON THE CURRENT PANDEMIC AND SETTING ASIDE THE CLIMATE CRISIS? NO. WE ARE RIGHT NOW UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO LEAD IN CLIMATE CRISIS ACTION AND BE AN IMPORTANT MODEL FOR OTHER CITIES TO TAKE ACTION. AND WHAT WAYS ARE WE LEADING. BECAUSE THE FORESIGHT FOR A PLAN FOR CARBON NEUTRALITY WE HAVE A TEAM IN PLACE AND WE HAVE A PLAN DESIGNED TO BE EQUITABLE AND NOT LEAVE BEHIND PEOPLE WITH LOW AND MIDDLE INCOMES, THOSE PEOPLE MOST VULNERABLE. IS THE PLAN PERFECT? NO. IS IT BEST IN THE MIDWEST? PROBABLY. MAYBE IT'S THE BEST ANYWHERE. WE EXPECT BUMPS IN THE ROAD AS WE EXECUTE THE PLAN, THE CURRENT PANDEMIC, BUDGET CRISIS AND OTHER UNFORESEEN AND OUTRIGHT FAILURE OF THE CARBON NEUTRALITY PLAN ITSELF, BUT THE CLIMATE CRISIS WON'T WAIT. WE ARE POISED TO REALLY HAVE SUCCESS AT ACTUALLY EFFECTIVELY ADDRESSING THE PROBLEM WITH MINIMAL IMPACT BY ACTING NOW. NOT DELAYING. THE CLIMATE CRISIS IS SADLY THE SIGNING ISSUE OF OUR TIME, EVEN OF THE CENTURY. NOT THE ONLY ISSUE, BUT ONE WITH A LASTING IMPACT ON US AND ESPECIALLY ON EVERYONE THAT FOLLOWS US. THE CRISIS, WHERE OUR ACTIONS ARE NOW WILL PREVENT IRREVERSIBLE, NEGATIVE CHANGES IN THE ENVIRONMENT.
00:44:57.337: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
00:45:01.074: >> THINGS LIKE CONTINUED FAST MELTING OF ICE, BY DOING WHAT WE KNOW AND WHAT SCIENCE TELLS US IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. WE NEED TO FULLY SUPPORT THE A2ZERO PLAN.
00:45:17.857: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS JEAN LUVERVICH.
00:45:29.636: >> HI, MY NAME IS JEAN LUVERVICH, I'M A CLINICAL SOCIAL WORKER AND I LIVE IN WARD 5. I WANTED TO READ THE FOLLOWING EXCHANGE FROM THE ANN ARBOR POLITICS FACEBOOK PAGE ON MAY 11th INTO THE PUBLIC RECORD. A COMMUNITY MEMBER WROTE:  HAS THERE BEEN ANY CONSIDERATION TO PROVIDING MORE HOUSING FOR LOW-INCOME CHICKENS? THERE HAS BEEN CONSIDERABLE RESEARCH SHOWING THAT INCREASING THE DENSITY OF CHICKEN CAGES IN AN URBAN AREA IMPROVES THEIR AFFORDABILITY. TOWARDS THAT END WE MIGHT CONSIDER IN ANN ARBOR A ZONING CHANGE ALLOWING ACU'S ACCESSORY CHICKEN UNITS IN SINGLE FAMILY NEIGHBORHOODS WITH EACH UNIT HOUSING UP TO 12 UNRELATED CHICK EPPS. YOU -- CHICKENS. YOU HEARD IT HERE FIRST. AND THEN SOMEWHAT SURPRISINGLY, COUNCILMEMBER ELIZABETH NELSON SAYS WHEN YOU STATE IT THAT WAY, IT SURE DOES SEEM LIKE A SIMPLE SOLUTION TO A LOT OF PROBLEMS. I WONDER JUST HOW MUCH COOPS AND HOW MANY CHICKENS ARE NEEDED TO ACHIEVE RESULTS. 20 CHICKENS PER ACRE, 50 CHICKENS PER ACRE? 100 CHICKENS PER ACRE? 1,000 CHICKENS PER ACRE? MY NEIGHBORHOOD PROBABLY AVERAGES ONLY ONE CHICKEN PER ACRE. THE SINGLE CHICKEN ACRES ARE SERIOUSLY HOARDING THE LAND. AND COUNCILMEMBER JACK EATON SAYS, I THINK IT SHOULD BE OBVIOUS THAT THE NEED FOR APPROPRIATE CHICKEN DENSITY COUPLED WITH PROVIDING ADEQUATE PER CHICKEN SPACE WILL REQUIRE CHICKEN COOP HIGHRISES. SHOULD WE GOOGLE HOW TO DO THIS OR HIRE A SIX-FIGURE CONSULTANT? AND KATHY GRISWOLD SAYS MY HUSBAND SAID NO CHICKENS. YOUR COMMENT IS JUST THE SUPPORT I NEED. I URGE CITY COUNCIL TO EMPHATICALLY REJECT THE RESOLUTION DC-8 AND TO SUPPORT THE EXISTING FUNDING THAT WE HAVE AGREED TO SUPPORT -- WE AGREED TO PROVIDE FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES IN THE EIGHTH MOST ECONOMICALLY SEGREGATED CITY IN AMERICA. AND I'M CONFIDENT THAT WE AS A COMMUNITY WILL DO THE RIGHT THING AND WILL BE SUPPORTIVE OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE FAMILIES. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR ATTENTION.
00:48:00.954: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
00:48:02.722: >> AND HAVE A GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE.
00:48:06.726: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS GLENN NELSON.
00:48:23.042: >> Clerk Beaudry: GO AHEAD, MR. NELSON.
00:48:24.477: >> I URGE YOU TO USE THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH AND PUBLIC SAFETY MILLAGE FUND SOLELY FOR MENTAL HEALTH -- EXCUSE ME -- AND PUBLIC SAFETY SERVICES. MOST VOTERS FOUGHT WHETHER TO INCREASE MENTAL HEALTH AND PUBLIC SAFETY SERVICES WHEN THEY CAST THEIR BALLOTS ON THE MILLAGE. THE CURRENT CRISIS OF COVID-19 MAKES IT ESPECIALLY URGENT THE PUBLIC OFFICIALS BE ACCOUNTABLE TO THOSE VOTERS. THE PROPOSED BUDGET VIOLATES ACCOUNTABILITY. THE BUDGET ALLOCATES 574,000 TO REPAIR THE BARTON AND THE SUPERIOR DAMS AND 430,000 CLIMATE CHANGE ACTIONS FROM THE MILLAGE. NEITHER HAS A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP TO MENTAL HEALTH AND PUBLIC SAFETY. THE BUDGET ALLOCATES 276,000 OF MILLAGE FUNDS FOR SALARIES AND BENEFITS OF CITY EMPLOYEES. APPROVAL WOULD INDICATE COUNCILMEMBERS BELIEVE ANN ARBOR WILL BE A BETTER PLACE WITH A LARGER CITY STAFF THAN THE OVER QUARTER OF A MILLION DOLLARS OF ADDITIONAL SERVICES FOR PEOPLE BEARING THE BRUNT OF COVID-19. THE BUDGET MOVES 300,000 FOR ITS SUPPORTIVE SERVICES FOR THOSE IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING FROM THE GENERAL FUND IN FISCAL '20 TO THE MENTAL HEALTH MILLAGE BOND IN FISCAL '21. THE PROPOSAL USES MILLAGE FUNDS TO FUND AN ITEM FORMALLY IN THE GENERAL FUND, THUS USING THE MILLAGE TO SUPPORT GENERAL FUND PROGRAMS. I BELIEVE THE BEST WAY TO GET OUR CITY BACK ON THE TRACK FOR PUBLIC OFFICIALS ARE ACCOUNTABLE AND RESPONSIVE IS, ONE, PASS THE RESOLUTION THAT RECOGNIZES EACH COUNCIL HAS THE RIGHT AND THE RESPONSIBILITY TO CONSTRUCT A BUDGET THAT REFLECTS ACCOUNTABILITY TO VOTERS AND RESPONSIVENESS TO THE MOST PRESSING PROBLEMS. TWO, HON BEER THE CLAUSE AND I QUOTE, FUNDING IS ENSURED FOR THE ACTIONS NECESSARY TO SUPPORT RESIDENTS' MOST IMPACTED BY THE CURRENT CRISIS, END QUOTE. AS YOU ADJUST THE PROPOSED BUDGET AND ESPECIALLY AS YOU APPROPRIATE THE MENTAL HEALTH MILLAGE FUNDS. IN CONCLUSION, I SHARE THE --
00:50:54.260: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
00:50:56.829: >>  -- MOST PEOPLE WHO SAY WE SHOULD REPAIR DAMS AND ADOPT CLIMATE CHANGE ACTIONS BUT THEY SHOULD NOT BE DONE AT THE EXPENSE OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES, ESPECIALLY NOW WHEN SO MANY OF OUR CITIZENS ARE SUFFERING FROM INSECURITY, PAIN, AND TRAUMA DUE TO COVID-19. USE THE MENTAL HEALTH MILLAGE FUNDS FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND PUBLIC SAFETY SERVICES. THANK YOU.
00:51:22.321: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS RIGHT RON S.
00:51:32.565: >> HI, I'M UNMUTED. MY NAME IS RON SUAREZ. I LIVE IN WARD 1, 506 NORTH STATE STREET. I WAS ON COUNCIL IN 2006 AND RETURNED TO ANN ARBOR LAST YEAR AFTER TEN YEARS IN NEW YORK CITY. I WANTED TO SPEAK BRIEFLY ABOUT MEDICARE FOR ALL. THIS SHOULD BE EASY FOR COUNCIL TO SUPPORT, SINCE IT DOESN'T IMPACT SPENDING ANY MONEY, EVEN THOUGH IT'S A SYMB SYMBOLING ME, I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE LET OUR VOICES LOCALLY BE KNOWN ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT NATIONAL ISSUE. AND I WANTED TO SPEAK IN PARTICULAR AS A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER IN THE '90s, I HAD 30 EMPLOYEES HERE IN ANN ARBOR, ARBOR INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS WAS THE COMPANY. AND IN ONE YEAR, WE HAD TO CHANGE INSURANCE COMPANIES THREE TIMES. THE INSURANCE COMPANY THAT COVERED US GOT ACQUIRED AND THEN THE COVERAGE CHANGED, BUT FROM THE COMPANY -- SO I HAD TO GO THROUGH THE APPLICATION PROCESS THREE TIMES. AND WHILE THE COST OF THE HEALTH INSURANCE FOR MY COMPANY WAS THE AVERAGE SALARY OF PROGRAMMERS WAS AROUND $85,000 A YEAR, THE COST WAS NOT SO MUCH A GIGANTIC PROBLEM FOR ME, BUT ALL OF THE WEEKS WASTED FROM MY TIME WHERE I WAS WEARING THE HATS OF THE HEAD OF MARKETING AND SALES AND RUNNING THE COMPANY, AND COMPETING WITH SOFTWARE COMPANIES FROM OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE THEY HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE, NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE. SO THIS SHOULD BE WHILE SYMBOLIC, THIS SHOULD BE AN EASY THING FOR COUNCIL TO SUPPORT. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO LET COUNCIL AND OTHERS KNOW THAT WE HAVE A SLACK WORK SPACE FOR COMMUNITY PEOPLE TO TALK ABOUT THESE KINDS OF ISSUES. IT'S NEIGHBORSQUAD.SLACK.COM. NEIGHBORSQUAD.SLACK.COM AND IF YOU HAVE AN A2GOV EMAIL ADDRESS, YOU DON'T HAVE TO REQUEST AN INVITE. YOU CAN JUST JOIN IT, AND THERE'S A MEDICARE FOR ALL CHANNEL IN THERE. IN ADDITION, THERE ARE THINGS ABOUT CLIMATE. SO THERE'S CHANNEL FOR --
00:54:06.218: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
00:54:07.620: >> AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE -- A PLANNED AROUND ZERO CARBON LOOK AT PROJECTS LIKE NEIGHBORS WHO WANT TO SHARE ELECTRICITY WITH NET METERING, DT Es IS GOING TO BE A BIG OBSTACLE WITH NOT ALLOWING NET METERING. [ BEEPING ] THANK YOU.
00:54:34.647: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS BARBARA HIGMAN.
00:54:44.223: >> HELLO?
00:54:44.924: >> Mayor Taylor: MS. HIGMAN, YOU'RE ON.
00:54:46.359: >> THANK YOU. THANK YOU, AND GOOD EVENING, MY NAME IS BARBARA HIGMAN. I'M A MEMBER OF THE WASHTENAW COUNTY COMMUNITY HEALTH BOARD AND LONG-STANDING MEMBER OF NAMI, THE NATIONAL ALLIANCE ON MENTAL ILLNESS. I DIRECTLY REPRESENT A COHORT OF INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE A MENTAL ILLNESS. I'M SPEAKING TO REAFFIRM MY OPINION THAT THE MONEY FROM THE MENTAL HEALTH AND PUBLIC SAFETY MILLAGE MUST BE ONLY USED FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND PUBLIC SAFETY. IT WAS NOT AFTER ALL THE CLIMATE ACTION MILLAGE. IT IS CRITICAL AND ESPECIALLY SO DURING THESE MONTHS OF THE CURRENT COVID-19 PANDEMIC THAT SUFFICIENT QUALITY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES BE AVAILABLE AND ACCESSIBLE TO EVERYONE WHO NEEDS THEM, INCLUDING PEOPLE WHO MAY BE AT RISK FOR DEATH BY SUICIDE. MENTAL ILLNESS IS A PANDEMIC AND IT HAS BEEN WITH US FOR EONS. ONE IN FIVE US ADULTS WILL EXPERIENCE MENTAL ILLNESS EACH YEAR. SUICIDE IS THE SECOND LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH AMONG PEOPLE AGE TO 10 TO 34. I ASK THAT WE ALL PAY ATTENTION TO MENTAL HEALTH. AND FIND MENTAL HEALTH AND PUBLIC SAFETY. THANK YOU.
00:56:09.375: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. ARE THERE COMMUNICATIONS TODAY FROM COUNCIL? FOLKS COULD USE THE RAISE HAND ON THE CUBE, I THINK I DID SEE COUNCILMEMBER SMITH AND COUNCICOUNCICOUNCICOUNCILMEMBER. LET'S ROLL WITH COUNCILMEMBER SMITH AND THEN RAMLAWI AND THE REST USE THE RAISE HAND FUNCTION ON ZOOM.
00:56:33.399: >> Councilmember Smith: YES, I WANTED TO GIVE A HUGE SHOUT OUT TO THE CITY STAFF THAT WERE WORKING ON THE BERM OPENING AND THE SEWER PROJECT ACROSS THE AMTRAKS. IT WAS QUITE AN EXTRAORDINARY FEAT TO GET THAT DONE AS QUICKLY AND AS SAFELY AS THEY DID. I THINK THEY DESERVE SOME RECOGNITION FOR A JOB WELL DONE UNDER EXTREMELY DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES. I WANT TO GIVE MY THANKS TO THOSE CREWS, THOSE CONSTRUCTION CREWS, OUR STAFF, AND THE CONSULTANTS THAT ARE WORKING ON IT. THANKS A LOT. THAT'S ALL I GOT.
00:57:07.500: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
00:57:08.567: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, MA MAYOR TAYLOR. I HAVE A COUPLE. THINGS TO SAY. FIRST, I WANTED TO APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT STAFF HAS BEEN DOING, TOM CRAWFORD AND OTHERS WITH HELPING THE DOWNTOWN MERCHANTS ASSOCIATIONS, THE DDA, GETTING OUR POLICE CHIEF AND OUR FIRE CHIEF TOGETHER AND ESTABLISHING A PLAN AS FAST AS POSSIBLE AND HOPE THAT WE CAN HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE, INCLUSIVE THOUGHTFUL PLAN IN PLACE FOR THE DOWNTOWN, FOR THE SUMMER MONTHS, THAT CAN HELP THE DOWNTOWN MERCHANTS AND PROTECT OUR RESIDENTS AS WELL WHO NEED TO OBVIOUSLY SOCIAL DISTANCE FOR SOME TIME TO COME. SO THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS. I HAVE BEEN ON A LOT OF CALLS WITH COUNCILMEMBER LUMM AND JUST NEH AND CURIOUS TRYING TO GET THINGS WORKING AND IT'S JUST GOOD TO KNOW THAT WE HAVE PEOPLE IN PLACE RIGHT NOW, AND MERCHANT ASSOCIATIONS AND A LOT OF INFORMATION AND DATA, THAT THEY ARE GOING TO GET BACK TO CITY STAFF AND HIGH FASHION TO GET SOMETHING IN PLACE HOPEFULLY FOR COUNCIL TO ADOPT AT OUR NEXT MEETING. SECONDLY, IT'S NOT SO -- SO POSITIVE AS THIS RECENT BARRAGE OF MAIL THAT WE GOT TODAY REGARDING DC8. I GUESS I WILL JUST TALK THAT WHEN IT COMES UP, BUT IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT IN OUR COMMUNITY CONVERSATIONS, PEOPLE CHOOSE TO USE MISINFORMATION AND WE SPENT A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF TIME TODAY AS -- AS SERVANTS, PUBLIC SERVANTS PUTTING OUT DUMPSTER FIRES. AND IT'S JUST REALLY DISAPPOINTING. I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS STEP UP AND PARTNER UP. IF ANYONE HAS BEEN WATCHING COUNCIL THE LAST SEVERAL MEETINGS, WE HAVE DONE A LOT FOR NEEDY AND THE HUNGRY AND THE HOMELESS, AND THE KIND OF EMAILS WE RECEIVED TODAY WERE EXTREMELY DISTURBING. AND I WOULD JUST URGE PEOPLE WHO PUT OUT MISINFORMATION TO THINK TWICE. BECAUSE I THINK THEY ARE ACTUALLY DOING MORE HARM THAN GOOD TO THEIR CAUSE.
00:59:39.551: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
00:59:42.087: >> Councilmember Nelson: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I JUST -- I JUST WANTED TO SHARE THAT I HAVE SOME MORE INTERESTING INTERVIEWS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE -- WHO ARE INTERESTED IN FINDING OUT HOW OTHERS ARE ADJUSTING TO THIS PANDEMIC. I TALKED TO SEVERAL PEOPLE, WHICH I -- THE LAST CONVERSATION WAS PARTICULARLY UPLIFTING, I THOUGHT BECAUSE HE REALLY TALKED ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY TO -- TO LOOK AT HOW OUR SOCIAL STRUCTURES HAVE REALLY NOT MET THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE VULNERABLE AND THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO SORT OF RETHINK HOW WE ARE DOING THINGS, JUST BROADLY AND GENERALLY. I WANT TO COMMENT THAT MY CONTACT INFORMATION IS ON THE CITY WEBSITE. MY PHONE NUMBER AND MY EMAIL ADDRESS, AND IN THIS TIME, WHEN IT'S HARDER TO CONNECT WITH EACH OTHER, I HOPE THAT ANYBODY WHO HAS ANY CONCERNS WILL REACH OUT AND TALK TO ME. THANKS.
01:00:43.382: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER COMMUNICATION FROM COUNCIL? COUNCILMEMBER GRAND?
01:00:46.618: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. I JUST WANT TO DRAW COUNCIL ATTENTION. I KNOW WE RECEIVED A LOT OF EMAILS AND CALLS TODAY, BUT I -- AS THE REPRESENTATIVE OR THE LIAISON TO THE STUDENT ADVISORY COUNCIL, WE DID RECEIVE A MESSAGE FROM THEIR CHAIR, KYLE McCALLUM AND THEY CALLED A SPECIAL MEETING IN ADDITION TO THEIR REGULAR MEETING BECAUSE ONE OF THEIR PRIORITIES IS CLIMATE ACTION. SO I DIDN' IF YOU DIDN'T TAKE A, THAT PLEASE TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. I RECEIVED -- I THINK WE HAD A TERRIFIC SPEAKER TONIGHT FOR ONE OF THE OTHER PUSHES FROM THE STUDENT ADVISORY COUNCIL IS TO CONTINUE TO PUSH FOR MORE YOUTH MEMBERS AND I THINK FROM OUR SPEAKER THIS EVENING, WE SAW BY EVEN THOSE UNDER THE AGE OF 16 CAN DO A TREMENDOUS JOB IN BEING ADVOCATES FOR ISSUES THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR COMMUNITY. AND THEN AS WE SAW WITH THE REMOVAL OF DC, 2WE ARE GOING TO NEED ANOTHER MEMBER OF THE GREENBELT ADVISORY COMMISSION. IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN THAT, PLEASE FEEL FREE TO GET IN TOUCH WITH ME AND SUBMIT AN APPLICATION. THANKS SO MUCH.
01:01:57.456: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
01:01:59.825: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES, WE WERE FORTUNATE THIS WEEKEND TO HAVE PRESIDENT OBAMA DELIVER AN UPLIFTING COMMENCEMENT ADDRESS. TWO TOPICS THAT STOOD OUT FOR ME WERE TRUTH AND BUILDING COMMUNITY. IT MADE THE FLOOD OF UNTRUTHFUL AND MISLEADING EMAILS I RECEIVED IN THE LAST TWO DAYS ALL THE MORE DISAPPOINTING. MY GREATEST CONCERN IS NOT FOR COUNCILMEMBERS AND NOT FOR THE HUNDREDS OF EMAILS THAT WE RECEIVED, BUT FOR THE CONCERN THAT IT CREATED FOR THE VULNERABLE COMMUNITY, THE SAME POPULATION THAT THESE ADVOCATES CLAIM THAT THEY ARE SPEAKING FOR. HOWEVER, I FOUND THEIR MESSAGES TO BE INSTIGATING AND CREATE STRESS AND TENSION. AND I RECEIVED A PHONE CALL FROM ONE OF THE YOUNG MEN WHOM I MENTORED AND HE WAS VERY AGITATED BY THE COMMENTS ON SOCIAL MEDIA. HE ATTEMPTED TO SPEAK TONIGHT BUT WAS NOT ABLE TO GET A SLOT. WE HAD SOMEONE READ THE CHICKEN COMMENTS TONIGHT. THAT WAS A POSITIVE STEP BECAUSE HOW ANYONE CAN GO FROM THOSE STATEMENTS TO RACIST CHARGES THAT SIMPLY UPSET MEMBERS OF THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY IS BEYOND ME. I GREW UP IN FLINT, WELL BELOW THE POVERTY LINE. WHEN I READ THAT, I SAW THAT AS A PARODY ON OUR PRODENSITY IDEAL LOGS, NOTHING TO DO WITH POOR PEOPLE AND NOTHING TO DO WITH MINORITIES. AND IN CLOSING, I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT I WAS A FOUNDING MEMBER OF CAN. I WAS A COSTER FOSTER MEMBER FOE OF THE CHILDREN THAT HAD LIVED AT A CAN SITE FOR OVER THREE YEARS. I'M WELL CONNECTED WITH OUR VULNERABLE POPULATION AND IT REALLY, REALLY DISTURBS ME WHEN I GET CALLS FROM VULNERABLE PEOPLE WHO ARE UPSET BY THE POLITICAL GAMESMANSHIP OF THIS COMMUNITY. LET'S THINK ABOUT THOSE VULNERABLE PEOPLE BEFORE WE SEND ANOTHER EMAIL. AND I WOULD LIKE TO SAY, WE NEED TRUTH, GOING BACK TO WHAT OBAMA SAID. WE NEED TRUTH, NOT MISLEADING, INSTIGATING POLITICAL RHETORIC. WE NEED COLLABORATION, NOT DIVISIVE ACTIONS. AND WE NEED STRONG LEADERSHIP, FROM ALL OF US. I'M NOT WICK PICKING ON ANYONE. STRONG LEADERSHIP FROM ALL OF US, NOT COMPLAYANCEY IS AND ANEEM -- COMPLACENCY AND ANEMIC RESPONSES. THANK YOU.
01:04:55.334: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER COMMUNICATIONS FROM COUNCIL? I WOULD LIKE TO REQUEST CONFIRMATION OF THE FOLLOWING APPOINTMENTS THAT WERE MADE TO COUNCIL AT OUR MAY 4th REGULAR SESSION.

01:06:47.145: >> Councilmember Bannister: HI, I JUST -- I HAD COUNCIL COMMENTS, COMMUNICATIONS BACK UNDER THE PREVIOUS AGENDA ITEM. I DON'T KNOW -- MY COMPUTER KEEPS SAYING I'M HAVING UNSTABLE INTERNET CONNECTION.
01:06:59.458: >> Mayor Taylor: I GUESS, LET'S -- IF YOU CAN, IF COUNCIL'S ACQUIESCENCE, LET'S ROLL YOU IN AFTER MAYOR COMMUNICATION. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
01:07:15.407: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WANT TO THANK THE FOLKS FROM IT TO HAVING AN EMERGENCY HARD LINE FROM MY BASEMENT UP HERE AND GET ME ONLINE. I WANT TO MAKE A QUICK COMMENT. SO WHEN I FIRST SAT ON COUNCIL, I MENTIONED THAT I WASN'T A BIG FAN OF ALL OF THESE REAPPOINTMENTS, THE CONSTANT REAPPOINTMENTS. I DON'T OPPOSE REAPPOINTMENTS. I FEEL THERE ARE A LOT OF NAMES OPEN THESE LISTS TO SERVE AND I PUT FORWARD. I EMAILS YOU, MR. MAYOR, YOU, AND OTHERS, SHARING FOLKS' NAMES WHO I THINK WOULD BE APPROPRIATE AND BENEFICIAL AND WOULD REPRESENT A CROSS SECTION OF YOU ARE OUR COMMUNITY. THAT IS MAYBE UNDERREPRESENTED ON SOME OF THESE BOARDS AND THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO HAPPEN EVER. I'M DISAPPOINTED BY THAT, BECAUSE I THINK THE -- THE MORE WE LOOK OUTSIDE OF OUR -- OUR LITTLE SHELLS, THE BETTER OPPORTUNITY WE HAVE FOR THE KIND OF REPRESENTATION AND INTERESTING THINKING AND DIVERSITY OF THOUGHT THAT WE SUPPOSEDLY CHERISH HERE IN THIS TOWN. SINCE I ASKED PEOPLE TO COME UP AND, YO YOU KNOW, INTRODUCE THEMSELVES TO ME WHEN THEY GO FOR THE REAPPOINTMENTS, A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE HAVE. WE HAD A PERSON ON THE VEBA TRUST BOARD AND WE SPOKE ABOUT A FEW ITEMS AND THAT WAS REALLY NICE TO HEAR HIS PERSPECTIVE ON THINGS AND TALK. AND SOME FOLKS FOR THE ELIZABETH DEAN FUND, I SPOKE TO, AND THEY HAVE GOOD IDEAS ABOUT THE SUSTAINABILITY INITIATIVES AND SO FORTH. I THIS THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT WE RECEIVED AS PART OF THE ADMINISTRATOR'S MEMO, THE TRANSPORTATION MEMO THAT SHOWS VARIOUS OPTIONS FOR TRANSPORTATION ACTIONS AND POTENTIAL CITY COUNCIL AND CITY STAFF ACTIONS. AND YOU MAY ALSO BE WELL AWARE THAT THAT MEMO WAS THE SUBJECT OF SOME CONTROVERSY BY REAPPOINTMENT TONIGHT. MS. KLEINMAN WHO IS UP FOR TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION, BASICALLY ACCUSED US ALL OF NOT RESPONDING TO A MEMO THAT WE NEVER RECEIVED AND I JUST OFFICIALLY RECEIVED THAT TONIGHT -- ACTUALLY, I RECEIVED A COUPLE OF WEEKS BACK WHEN I RECEIVED IT. THE FIRST TIME A RECEIVED IT IT FROM SOMEONE WHO RECEIVED IT BEFORE ANY COUNCILMEMBERS DID. I'M PLEASED TO GET BACK TO COUNCIL ME COMMENTS THAT WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO WOULD RATHER POLITICIZE THE SITUATION RATHER THAN INFORM THE PEOPLE WITH WHAT'S GOING ON. THAT DOESN'T FILL ME WITH CONFIDENCE WITH THEIR ABILITY TO LEAD. I WANT TO THROW THAT OUT THERE. I THINK IF PEOPLE WANT TO SERVE IN THESE BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS, THEY ARE WELCOME TO DO SO, BUT DON'T TURN THEM INTO SOME KIND OF POLITICAL EVENT AND PULL SOME KIND OF SHE GH  SHENANIGANS ANDE COUNCIL FOR SOMETHING THAT WE HAD NEVER SEEN. I THINK THAT'S INCUMBENT UPON THE MAYOR TO VET THESE FOLKS AND CONSIDER THEIR BEHAVIORS BEFORE THE CONSTANT STRING OF APPOINTMENTS COMES BEFORE US ONCE AGAIN. THANK YOU.
01:10:26.564: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
01:10:27.565: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES, I'M SORRY. A PROCEDURAL HERE. IS THIS WHEN WE START PULLING NAMES OFF --
01:10:33.371: >> Mayor Taylor: IF YOU WISH TO PULL NAMES OFF, THEN THIS IS WHERE YOU DO THIS.
01:10:36.908: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I WOULD LIKE TO PULL AMANDA CARLISLE'S NAME OFF. FROM THE HOUSING AND HUMAN SERVICES ADVISORY BOARD.
01:10:49.587: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. WE'LL WORK ON MS. CARLISLE AFTER THE BALANCE OF THE APPOINTMENTS ARE ADDRESSED. FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE REMAINDER? ALL IN FAVOR OF THE APPOINTMENTS AS PRESENT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF MS. CARLISLE TO THE HOUSING AND HUMAN SERVICES ADVISORY BOARD. PLEASE SAY AYE. [CHORUS OF AYES] ALL OPPOSED? LET'S HAVE A ROLL CALL VOTE ON THAT, PLEASE. MY APOLOGIES. ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:11:25.190: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES. I'M SORRY, YES.
01:11:30.495: >> Councilmember Hayner:  NO.
01:11:31.563: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES.
01:11:34.065: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES.
01:11:40.438: >> Councilmember Lumm: (INAUDIB.
01:11:45.910: >> Councilmember Grand: YES.
01:11:46.511: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES.
01:11:53.017: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
01:11:53.585: >> Councilmember Eaton: YES.
01:11:54.185: >> Councilmember Nelson:  YES.
01:11:57.789: >> Councilmember Smith: YES.
01:11:58.490: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION CARRIES.
01:11:59.657: >> Mayor Taylor: MAY I HAVE -- I WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION TO THE HOUSING AND HUMAN SERVICES ADVISORY BOARD, AMANDA CARLISLE. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER SMITH. DISCUSSION OF THE NOMINATION. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:12:14.439: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES. AS I SAID DURING COUNCIL COMMUNICATIONS, I HAVE HAD A VERY ROUGH DAY, BOTH ON THE PHONE, TEXT, EMAIL. AND IT'S A RESULT OF, YOU KNOW, MISINFORMATION BEING PUT OUT THERE. SOMEBODY IN A POSITION, A POSITION OF INFORMATION, A POSITION OF INFLUENCE, A POSITION OF POWER, A POSITION OF RESPECT. A POSITION OF DUTY. OF TOO FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY. NOW, IF YOU WANT TO GO TAG INFORMATION ON YOUR OWN PERSONAL FACEBOOK PAGE, THE PLEASURE IS ALL MINE. GO TO ONE OF THOSE ECHO CHAMBERS AND COMMENT ALL THE WAY. BUT WHEN YOU PUT OUT THIS EMAIL AND YOU SIGNED YOUR NAME OFF ON IT, AND YOU MAKE MY JOB THE WAY IT WAS TODAY, YOU DO HAVEN'T MY SUPPORT. I DON'T CARE WHO YOU ARE. I'M SORRY. THIS IS WHERE THE BUCK STOPS.
01:13:37.689: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN?
01:13:38.623: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. SO I WILL SPEAK TO MS. CARLISLE IN A MOMENT, BUT WITH RESPECT TO THE EMAIL CAMPAIGN WE GOT TODAY, AND THE FORAY OF COMMUNICATION AND THE MESSAGES CONTAINED. I WOULD SAY FIRST OF ALL, WE ARE DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED PUBLIC OFFICIALS. WE GET A LOT OF COMMUNICATION AND IT'S OUR JOB TO TAKE THAT IN STRIDE AND RESPECTFULLY AND OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS, I HAVE GOTTEN A LOT OF COMMUNICATION THAT DOESN'T FEEL GOOD BUT IT'S NOT OUR JOB TO STAND UP HERE AND THROW STONES BACK AT THE PEOPLE WOULD ELECT US. AND WE HAVE TO TAKE THAT IN STRIDE AND RESPECT FOR IT. AND I THINK ALSO IF YOU ELICIT THIS STRONG EMOTIONAL REACTION FROM SOME OF OUR, YOU KNOW, MOST ESTABLISHED, RESPECTED NONPROFITS AND COMMUNITY, YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT YOURSELF IN THE MIRROR AS A LEADER. THAT SOMETHING BROKE DOWN IN THE COMMUNICATION. WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT CLEAR COMMUNICATION. WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT HOW WE CAN BETTER THOSE CHANNELS MORE PROACTIVELY. AND SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY, A BUNCH OF VERY WELL-RESPECTED NONPROFITS GOT REALLY AFRAID THAT THEY WEREN'T GOING TO BE ABLE TO SERVE THEIR CLIENTS WHO ARE THE MOST VULNERABLE RESIDENTS OF OUR COMMUNITY. AND THAT'S A FAILURE OF COMMUNICATION FROM LEADERSHIP, AND WE NEED TO LOOK AT OURSELVES FIRST. WITH RESPECT TO MS. CARLISLE, SHE SERVES ON THE HOUSING AND HUMAN SERVICES ADVISORY BOARD WITH DISTINCTION. SHE IS A PILLAR OF THAT GROUP. I THINK YOU WOULD BE HARD PRESSED TO FIND ANYONE IN THIS COMMUNCOMMUNITY COUNTY WHO HAS - COUNTY WHO HAS THE EXPERTISE IN FIGHTING HOMELESSNESS. SHE SPENT FIVE YEARS FIGHTING HOMELESSNESS IN CHICAGO BEFORE MOVING TO DETROIT, WHERE SHE SPENT ANOTHER THREE YEARS FIGHTING HOMELESSNESS AND FINALLY SETTLED WORKING PROFESSIONALLY IN OUR COMMUNITY WHERE SHE'S BEEN THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE WASHTENAW HOUSING ALLIANCE FOR THE LAST SIX YEARS, WHICH BOTH ADVISES ON POLICY, ADVISE ON SPENDING PRIORITIES, BUT ALSO DOES DIRECT INTERVENTIONS ON HOMELESSNESS. SO MS. CARLISLE, NOT ONLY KNOWS THE POLICY THAT WE HAVE TO IMPLEMENT IN ORDER TO END HOMELESSNESS IN THIS COMMUNITY, BUT SHE ALSO UNDERSTANDS THE BUDGETING OF WHAT ARE THE DIFFICULT TRADEOFFS WE NEED TO MAKE AND FINALLY, SHE KNOWS THE NAMES AND THE FACES OF THE PEOPLE WHO WERE -- WHO WE'RE TRYING TO HELP. SHE HAS FOR THE LAST SIX YEARS LED THE PERSONAL CENSUS OF EVERY HOMELESS MEMBER OF OUR COUNTY -- HOMELESS COMMUNITY MEMBER OF OUR COUNTY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE ACCURATE DATA TO GET THE FUNDING WE NEED BUT ALSO THAT DIRECT OUTREACH IS SUPPLIED TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS. SO SHE'S A 50,000-FOOT THINKER BUT SHE'S ALSO ON-THE-GROUND, SHAKE HANDS WITH HOMELESS NEIGHBORS AND GET THEM THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED. AND THAT'S AN INCREDIBLE BALANCE THAT I DON'T THINK YOU ARE GOING TO FIND IN MANY OTHER PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTY. AND IF WE CAN'T SAY YES TO MS. CARLISLE, THEN I DON'T KNOW WHO WE'RE GOING TO BE PUTTING ON OUR PUBLIC COMMISSIONS.
01:16:56.921: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
01:16:57.822: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANKS, MR. MAYOR. THAT'S ALL WELL AND GOOD BUT I APPRECIATE WHAT COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI JUST SAID. IT'S NOT ABOUT -- IT'S NOT ABOUT BEING ABLE TO TAKE IT. IT'S ABOUT QUESTIONING THE SOURCE OF THIS MISINFORMATION, AND WHEN YOU GET FOLKS SENDING OUT EMAILS THAT ARE FULL OF MISINFORMATION, THAT ARE AGITATING AND REALLY FRIGHTENING THE RESIDENTS IN OUR COMMUNITY, THE MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY THAT WERE WAYS THAT WERE CLEARLY REFLECTED IN OUR EMAILS WE GOT TODAY, IT'S A PROBLEM. IT'S A BIG PROBLEM. WE ALREADY HAVE STRESS FROM WHAT'S GOING ON IN OUR LIVES. WE DON'T NEED ADDED STRESS BY CLEARLY -- CLEARLY EITHER NOT READING OR MISCONSTRUING THE THINGS THAT ARE BEFORE THEM, AND IT COULD BE EITHER, FRANKLY. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHICH IT IS. I MEAN, I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON. I HAD TO ASK SOMEBODY TO FORWARD ME THIS CANNED EMAIL. I CAN SEE NORTH SIDE COMMUNITY CENTER FROM MY WINDOW AND I -- I MEAN, I IMMEDIATELY CALLED DERRICK MILLER OVER THERE AND HAD A VERY NICE CONVERSATION WITH HIM TO POINT OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON AND ASK HIM WHERE ALL OF THIS WAS COMING FROM. I FELT LIKE I -- I TRIED TO DO WHAT I COULD TO LISTEN TO HIS LEGITIMATE CONCERNS NOT ONLY ABOUT OUR BUDGET PROCESS TONIGHT, BUT ABOUT, YOU KNOW, THE SERVICES THAT THEY ARE STRETCHED THIN IN TRYING TO PROVIDE RIGHT NOW. AND BETWEEN THE COMMUNITY CENTER AND THE NORTH SIDE -- AND THE AEROWOOD COMMUNITY CENTER, THEY ARE STRESSED THIN OVER HERE. I APPRECIATED THE OPPORTUNITY TO IS TALKTALK TO HIM. YES, WE ALL HAVE TO LOOK IN THE MIRROR. SURE, I'M LOOKING IN THE MIRROR RIGHT NOW, BUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT WRONG TO EXPRESS YOUR CONCERN ABOUT THE SPREAD OF OBVIOUS MISINFORMATION. AND REALLY, THE EMOTIONAL TOLL IT TAKES ON PEOPLE IF OUR COMMUNITY. YOU KNOW THAT -- I MEAN, WE GOT A MIX OF EMAILS. WE GOT A LOT OF CUT AND PASTE. WE GOT A LOT OF GENUINE HEARTFELT CONCERNS EXPRESSED AND IT'S INCUMBENT UPON US. AND REDUCE THE EMOTIONAL PANEL THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE IN. THAT TAKES TIME. I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY OUT THERE IN THE CITY WOULD IS PAYING ME 14 -- YOU ARE EACH PAYING ME 14 CENTS A YEAR TO SERVE YOU. AND, YOU KNOW, I HOPE YOU ARE GETTING YOUR MONEY'S WORTH. I MEAN, I DON'T MIND SPENDING ALL DAY PUTTING OUT FIRES THAT ARE CREATED FOR PURELY POLITICAL REASONS BECAUSE I'M NOT DOING IT FOR THE POLITICAL REASON. I'M DOING IT TO ASSUAGE THE CONCERNS OF RESIDENTS WHEN THEY HAVE BEEN MISLED. SO I WON'T SPEAK TO MS. CARLISLE. I KNOW SHE SERVED FOR A LONG TIME AND I HAVE HAD -- YOU KNOW, I HAVE HAD MY VARIOUS ENCOUNTERS WITH OTHER AND OTHER FOLKS IN THE COMMUNITY. THAT'S FINE. I GENERALLY DON'T FAVOR THE REAPPOINTMENTS WHEN I KNOW THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE WILLING TO SERVE. I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO MR. RAMLAWI FOR SPEAKING OUT ON THAT.
01:20:12.817: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
01:20:18.089: >> Councilmember Lumm: I WOULD LIKE TO THANK COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI AND GRISWOLD. I THINK IT TAKES A LOT OF COURAGE FOR THEM TO SPEAK OUT ABOUT THE MISINFORMATION, FRANKLY, THAT WAS DELIVERED ACROSS THE CITY TODAY WHICH RESULTED IN ALL OF THESE EMAILS. AGAIN, IT'S NOT -- IT'S IMPLIED THAT MAYBE THERE ARE COUNCILMEMBERS THAT CAN'T TAKE THIS. YOU KNOW, KIND OF INCOMING MESSAGING. THAT'S -- THAT'S REALLY NOT A FAIR PORTRAYAL OF THE CONCERN. AND I CAN ASSURE EVERYONE THAT COUNCILMCOUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD,, COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS AS WELL. ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES ARE STRONG AND TOLERANT, WELL-INTENTIONED, GOOD PEOPLE, AND HARD TO RILE, FRANKLY. AND THEY JUST -- YOU KNOW, IT'S -- YOU KNOW, IT IS -- IT IS FRUSTRATING WHEN THE COMMUNICATIONS ARE BASED ON MISINFORMATION, AND THAT'S WHAT OCCURRED TODAY. AND I HAVE I THINK THAT THE COMMUNICATOR BEARS A RESPONSIBILITY TO BE FULLY INFORMED BEFORE SENDING OUT MASS MESSAGES THAT ARE MISLEADING AND NOT ACCURATE. I HAVE SEEN THIS OCCUR BEFORE. YOU KNOW, WE ARE ALL FOR PROTECTING FREE SPEECH AND ONE'S RIGHT TO ADVOCATE FOR CAUSES AND WORK THAT THEY ARE PASSIONATE ABOUT. AND NO ONE IS SAYING THAT THAT IS NOT APPROPRIATE. THE PROBLEM, I BELIEVE, HERE IS THAT THE -- IT IS A COMMUNICATION FAILURE, AND I THINK THE COMMUNICATOR BEARS THE RESPONSIBILITY TO OWE IT, TO THE PEOPLE -- THE INDIVIDUALS, OR THE TOPIC TO FIRST DO SOME FACT CHECKING BEFORE YOU HIT SEND. THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN. I DIDN'T GET ANY CALLS BEFORE READING THESE MASS EMAILS AND, AGAIN I HAVE SEEN THIS BEFORE WITH VARIOUS DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS AND EVEN LITTLE HOPEFULLY SMALL THINGS LIKE NEIGHBORHOOD APPLICATIONS FOR SEU COMMENTS THAT GO TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION, AND SO I SHARE THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN ARTICULATED AND, AGAIN, I APPRECIATE THE COURAGE -- OOPS. TAME COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
01:23:29.246: >> Councilmember Lumm: I LOST THE CONNECTION BUT I'M BACK. ANYWAY, I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES WHO SPOKE PREVIOUSLY FOR BEING COURAGEOUS. IT'S NOT EASY TO -- TO SPEAK IN A WAY THAT IS TRULY HONEST ALL THE TIME, BUT MAYBE POLITICALLY -- YOU KNOW, THEY WERE PUTTING THEMSELVES OUT THERE, REALLY. AND I KNOW THAT THEY WILL BE CITE SCRITICIZED AS I LIKELY WI, BUT THEY ARE BEING COURAGEOUS AND HONEST. THANK YOU.
01:24:12.289: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER SMITH.
01:24:13.757: >> Councilmember Smith: THANK YOU. I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS I LEARNED PRETTY EARLY ON IN COLLEGE WAS THAT MI POLITICS ISE COMPETITION FOR SCARCE RESOURCES. IN THE CONDITIONS I'M LIVING IN, IF I'M PART OF AN ORGANIZATION THAT'S STRETCHED TO THE LIMIT AND THE UNCERTAINTY IS THERE, IF I'M LOOKING AT YET ANOTHER DISCUSSION ABOUT SEEING FUNDING THAT HAS BEEN EARMARKED TO SUPPORT THE SERVICES THAT I'M PROVIDING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR FIGHTING HOMELESSNESS, I GET SCARED. AND, YOU KNOW, I FIND THE COMMUNICATION BREAKDOWN IS, YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE THINGS IF THE INTENTION WAS NOT TO REMOVE FUNDING FOR -- FOR THE SERVICES AND THESE PROVIDERS, I THINK IT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER COMMUNICATED IN THE -- IN THE RESOLUTION AS I HAVE INDICATED TO COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, I DON'T SUPPORT THE RESOLUTION AS IT'S WRITTEN. I THINK, YOU KNOW, WE ARE HAVING ANOTHER DISCUSSION ABOUT 40/40/20. I THINK THOSE OF WHITE HOUSE HAVE BEEN UPSET -- OF US WHO HAVE BEEN UPSET ABOUT SOME OF THE DECISIONS THAT HAVE HAPPENED IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS HAVE ON ABOUT TOLD THAT WE NEED TO MOVE ON. I WOULD ECHO MY CONSTITUENT DAN RUBENSTEIN, A PERSON WHO I TYPICALLY DISAGREE, WHO SAYS IT'S TIME TO MOVE PAST THAT AND LET'S TRY AND WORK TOGETHER. I THINK THAT OPPOSING. THIS I UNDERSTAND THAT PEOPLE ARE UPSET AND THEY ARE TAKING IT HARD. BUT WE WILL CONSIDER THE REAPPOINTMENT TO RITA MITCHELL TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION. AND RITA IS A PERSON WHO IS POLITICAL AND WHO HAS ENGAGED IN WILLFUL DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGNS. AND I THINK THAT SHE WRITES PASSION AND INTENSITY AND I HAVE PLANNED TO SUPPORT HER NOMINATION TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION. IT'S -- I THINK WHEN WE HAVE PEOPLE LIKE MS. CARLISLE OR MS. MITCHELL WHO BRING A CERTAIN SKILL SET TO OUR BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS, WE SHOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT. I THINK WE ARE SHOULD BE BIG ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO PUT OUR PERSONAL POLITICS AND OUR PERSONAL RESENTMENTS ASIDE. THANK YOU.
01:26:36.934: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
01:26:38.535: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES, SOMEONE TOLD ME RECENTLY IF YOU ARE NOT CATCHING FLACK, YOU ARE NOT OVER THE TARGET. I CAN TAKE ALMOST ANYTHING, BUT I'M OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER THE RIOTS IN THE LAST CENTURY, THE RIOTS IN THE LATE '60s, AND THEREFORE, I'M VERY SENSITIVE WHEN SOMEONE COMMUNICATES IN A WAY THAT INSIGHTS OR INSTIGATES SOMETHING, AND THAT IS HOW THIS LETTER WAS RECEIVED BY SOME OF OUR VULNERABLE POPULATION WHO CALLED ME. AND I'M VERY SORRY THAT THEY HAD A LAPSE IN JUDGMENT, BUT I JUST -- I HAVE VERY LITTLE PATIENCE FOR THIS TYPE OF INCITY GATING BEHAVIOR -- INSTIGATING BEHAVIOR WHETHER WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC, WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF A FINANCIAL CRISIS AND WHILE WE HAVE NOT BEEN DIRECTLY HARMED AT THIS TIME, MANY PEOPLE HAVE AND THERE IS TREMENDOUS FEAR AMONG SOME IN OUR COMMUNITY. AND WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO TREAT THEM WITH COMPASSION AND SUPPORT THEM. THANK YOU.
01:27:54.778: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
01:27:56.113: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES. I TOO RECEIVED PHONE CALLS TODAY FROM PEOPLE WHO WERE VERY AGITATED AND CONCERNED BY THAT FALSE INFORMATION THAT WAS SPREAD ALL OVER THE INTERNET. BUT I WANTED TO SHARE WITH YOU ALL A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE THAT WE ACTUALLY -- I SERVE WITH COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN ON THE HHSB, AND I CAME TO FIND OUT THAT THERE ARE ACTUALLY OVER 19 RESIDENTS OF -- WHO -- [ NO AUDIO ]
01:28:34.818: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER --
01:28:36.920: >> Councilmember Bannister: WOULD HAVE SUBMITTED APPLICATIONS. IT'S A LONG LIST. AND SO THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT TERESA GILOTTI AND MAYOR TAYLOR AND FOLKS WILL TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT THAT LIST AND SEE IF THIS ARE'S MORE PEOPLE -- IF WE CAN ADD A COUPLE, TWO OR THREE NEW FACES TO EXISTING BOARD. AND OF COURSE, MAYOR TAYLOR GETS TO APPOINT THEM. BUT I DID WANT TO ADD THAT INTO THE MIX THAT WHEN WE DO JUST -- WE HAVE A LOT OF APPOINTMENTS -- THE MAYOR HAS REAPPOINTED A LOT OF FOLKS TONIGHT. JUST REAPPOINTING THEM AND IF THEY ARE, AS WE ARE SEEING IN SOME CASES TURNING OUT TO BE POLITICAL APPOINTEES, AND LOYALISTS, THAT IS A PROBLEM, ESPECIALLY WHEN WE HAVE MORE THAN A DOZEN, YOU KNOW, 19, 20 PEOPLE WHO ARE ALSO LOOKING TO SERVE ON THESE COMMITTEES.
01:29:36.747: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
01:29:38.248: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM A SINGLE ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES WHAT THE ACTUAL MISINFORMATION WAS THAT WAS BEING SPREAD. SO IT SEEMS TO ME THAT BY CALLING PEOPLE LIARS WHEN THEY CAN'T RESPOND, YOU ARE TRYING TO TAKE THE MORAL HIGH GROUND WITHOUT MUCH OF A LEG TO STAND ON. MS. CARLISLE TODAY IN FIGHTING FOR THESE SCARCE RESOURCES IN LOOK TO WHAT POTENTIALLY COULD BE THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF DC-8, YOU KNOW, SHE WAS -- SHE WAS JUST SAYING MAYBE YOU DIDN'T THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT IF YOU PASSED THIS, MY ORGANIZATION, AND OTHERS THAT WORK TO -- WORK FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE IN OUR COMMUNITY MAY LOSE OUT ON REALLY IMPORTANT RESOURCES. AND SHE WAS DOING WHAT AN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF AN ORGANIZATION THAT ADVOCATES FOR HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS AND FOR THOTHOSE ISSUES SHOULD BE DOING. AND JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE THE MESSAGES OF EMAILS THAT YOU ARE GETTING, DON'T MEAN THAT THEY COME FROM A PLACE OF MISINFORMATION. IT JUST COMES FROM A PLACE THAT YOU DON'T LIKE BECAUSE YOU MAY NOT WANT TO FACE THE TRUTH THAT YOU WOULD BE SUPPORTING SOMETHING THAT HAS UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. I'M NOT SAYING THE INTENT WAS BAD. I'M JUST SAYING THAT MAYBE YOU DIDN'T THINK IT THROUGH. AND FOR COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI TO SIT UP HERE AND SAY, I'M NOT GOING TO SUPPORT YOU BECAUSE YOU SENT ME A BUNCH OF EMAILS. THAT'S NOT COURAGEOUS, IT'S BEING A BULLY.
01:31:16.446: >> Councilmember Hayner: POINT OF ORDER. THAT'S THE THIRD NAME CALLING. IT'S THE THIRD NAME CALLING IN THIS DOCTOR.
01:31:24.221: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
01:31:25.255: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I CAN TAKE IT. LET COUNCILMEMBER GRAND USE THAT TERMINOLOGY. LET THE PUBLIC HEAR MS. GRAND SPEAK.
01:31:33.196: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I'M TRYING TO BRING SOME ORDER TO THIS. NAME CALL.
01:31:38.735: >> Mayor Taylor: THERE'S BEEN ACCUSATIONS FLYING IN A VARIETY OF DIRECTIONS.
01:31:43.073: >> Councilmember Grand: THE MISINFORMATION --
01:31:44.174: >> Councilmember Hayner:  NAME CALLING IS AGAINST COUNCIL RULES, MR. TAYLOR.
01:31:50.747: >> Mayor Taylor: THE BEHAVIOR WAS DESCRIBED, NOT THE INDIVIDUAL.
01:31:57.721: >> Councilmember Grand: I WAS NOT DESCRIBING THE INTENT BUT THE BEHAVIOR. I UNDERSTAND THAT PEOPLE MAY NOT LIKE HUNDREDS OF  EMAILS THAT STARTED WITH REAL BEHAVIOR. LET'S TALK ABOUT FACTS WHETHER THE INTENT, AGAIN, WAS MEANT TO BE WHAT IT WAS MEANT TO BE. THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THIS COMMUNITY WHO WERE UPSET WHEN CERTAIN MEMBERS OF THIS COUNCIL COMPARED FOR PEOPLE TO CHICKENS. NOT OKAY, RIGHT? AND THEY MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY. I'M AGAIN NOT SPEAKING TO THE INTENT, BUT THIS IS WHERE SOME OF THIS FEAR COMES FROM. IF WE SIT UP HERE AND SAY I DISAGREE WITH IT, THEREFORE WE DON'T WANT YOUR EXPERTISE AND YOU ARE THEREFORE SOME SORT OF POLITICAL APPOINTEE. IT'S JUST NONSENSICAL. AND TO CALL THE PERSON THAT YOU DISAGREE WITH A LOYALIST, AND TO CALL SOMEONE THAT YOU AGREE WITH SOMEONE WHO JUST WANTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE, I THINK IS REALLY DISINGENUOUS.
01:33:05.455: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, LET ME OBSERVE THAT WE HAVE PROBABLY SPOKEN ABOUT THIS FOR 25 MINUTES. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:33:11.828: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: APPRECIATE IT. I WILL JUST RESPOND TO MRS.  -- COUNCILMEMBER GRAND BY I MIGHT BE A BULLY, BUT I DON'T CALL MY CONSTITUENTS CHILDREN. NOW, I WILL GO ON ABOUT THIS CASE HERE. IN THIS EMAIL, AMANDA CARLISLE SAYS THIS RESOLUTION TAKES AWAY FUNDING THAT HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY SUPPORTED, AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND RELATED SERVICES AND STATES THE FUNDING THE CITY RECEIVES BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, GET CRETEED LIKE ALL OTHER UNRESTRICTED GENERAL PURPOSE TAX REVENUES OF THE CITY DETERMINING HOW THEY SHOULD BE SPENT. THAT'S THE TRUTH. OKAY? WE WANT TO TEA CONTROL OF OUR BUDGET. I WILL TALK ABOUT THAT LATER. THE FACT IS HERE, WE HAD HUNDREDS OF EMAILS THAT READ THIS, AND THE INTERPRETATION THEY GOT FROM THIS WAS THEY WERE STRIPPING FUNDING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING, AND WE'RE STRIPPING MONEY FOR THE NEEDY AND THE HOMELESS AND IT'S LIKE HAS AMANDA CARLISLE WATCHED LAST THREE COUNCIL MEETINGS TO SEE THE OVER HALF MILLION DOLLARS IN SUPPLEMENTAL MONIES THAT COUNCIL HAS APPROVED FOR THE COUNTY AND FOR THE ANN ARBOR HOUSING COMMISSION? HAS AMANDA CARLISLE WATCHED CITY COUNCIL TO SEE WHAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING LATELY? I'M SORRY. BUT IF YOU WANT TO BECOME A POLITICAL WIN AND THEN BE ON A NONPROFIT, IT'S JUST -- YOU KNOW, KEEP THE POLITICS OUT OF IT. DO YOUR DAY JOB WITHOUT THE POLITICS. SO I'M SORRY. BUT THIS PERSON HAS BEEN MAKING MY LIFE AND MY JOB MUCH MORE DIFFICULT. THIS PERSON DOES NOT HAVE MY SUPPORT.
01:35:05.909: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCIL MEMBER ACKERMAN.
01:35:07.878: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  I GUESS I WILL SAY I'M UNCLEAR OF WHAT THE MISINFORMATION IS. WHAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE ACCURATE INFORMATION WAS JUST BLAH, BLAH, BLAHS. THAT WAS NOT VERY CLEAR. WHEN YOU HAVE MONEY EARMARKED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND SUPPORTIVE SERVICES, AND YOU TAKE THAT EARMARK AWAY AND REDUCE THE GUARANTEE THAT THAT MONEY WILL GO TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND SUPPORTIVE SERVICES, THERE IS A LEGITIMATE FEAR CREATED THAT THAT MONEY WILL NOT GO TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND SUPPORTIVE SERVICES. THAT'S A LEGITIMATE CONCERN BECAUSE YOU ARE TAKING AWAY THE GUARANTEES. AND AS SOMEONE WHOSE BUDGET AND MISSION RELIES ON THOSE GUARANTEES IT INSERTS A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY IN A VERY UNCERTAIN ENVIRONMENT, WHICH IS THIS COVID CRISIS. IT WAS NOT JUST ONE NONPROFIT'S INTERPRETATION OF THIS RESOLUTION. IT WAS TWO OR THREE, ALL OF WHOM ARE LONG-TERM PARTNERS OF THE CITY AND FOR A LONG TIME HAVE SERVED OUR MOST VULNERABLE RESIDENTS. AND SO, AGAIN, I DON'T THINK -- I THINK COUNCILMEMBER GRAND HIT IT ON THE HEAD. I DON'T THINK THE INTENT WAS BAD, BUT WHEN YOU REDUCE THE GUARANTEES THAT MONEY IS GOING TO GO TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS, YOU INJECT UNCERTAINTY INTO WHETHER OR NOT HOMELESS RESIDENTS AND THOSE WHO NEED SUPPORTIVE HOUSING WILL BE CAREFUL.
01:36:41.471: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
01:36:42.606: >> Councilmember Lumm: I WOULD SAY, HOW DIFFICULT WOULD IT BE TO PICK UP THE PHONE AND GET THE INFORMATION FROM THE SPONSORS IN THIS CASE. I GOT NO SUCH CALL. THAT WOULD HAVE CLEARED THE AIR BEFORE ALL THE EMAILS WERE SENT OUT AND I DO REGRET THAT SO MANY VULNERABLE PEOPLE IN THE PROCESS WERE UNNECESSARILY ALARMED. IT REALLY WAS NOT -- IT'S NOT HOW WE SHOULD TREAT PEOPLE.
01:37:13.136: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. I, OF COURSE, AM. GOING TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE APPOINTMENT. MS. CARLISLE HAS DONE OUTSTANDING WORK ON THE HHSAB, OF COURSE, AND HAS COMMITTED HER PROFESSIONAL LIFE TO SERVING THE UNDERSERVED HERE IN ANN ARBOR, SOMETHING SHE DOES WITH PASSION AND EXPERTISE AND DISTINCTION. ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.

01:38:43.593: >> Councilmember Hayner:  WOW! THIS SECTION HAS ONLY SLIGHTLY IMPROVED. THANK YOU. I WANT TO PULL CA-7 FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION. WHILE APPRECIATE DR. STULTS' PRESENTATION, LIKE MANY OF YOU, I PROBLEMY THERE ONLY RECEIVED THE WHOLE OF IT -- I PROBABLY ONLY RECEIVED THE WHOLE THING AT 10 P.M. LAST NIGHT AFTER ASKING FOR IT.
01:39:11.688: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE CONSENT AGENDA. CLERK MAYOR TAYLOR, JUST TO NOTE THAT CA6 WAS PREVIOUSLY DELETED.
01:39:21.364: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. FURTHER DISCUSSION OF CA-IS THROUGH 5. ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? THE CONSENT AGENDA, CA-1 THROUGH CA-5. AND CA-78, RESOLUTION ADOPTING THE LIVING A2ZERO ANN ARBOR CARBON NEUTRALITY PLAN. MOVED BY SMITH AND SECONDED BY LUMM . DISCUSSION, PLEASE, OF CA-7. I HAVE COUNCILMEMBER LUMM AND COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER SPOKEN FIRST. AND WITH YOUR ACQUIESCENCE.
01:39:57.000: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I'M HAPPY TO DEFER IF COUNCILWOMAN LUMM HAS SOMETHING. I DIDN'T KNOW IF MS. STULTS IS HERE.
01:40:06.443: >> Clerk Beaudry: I'M MOVING HER OVER NOW.
01:40:12.582: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, YOU HAVE THE QUEUE.
01:40:15.418: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WILL PASS UNTIL SHE GETS HERE.
01:40:19.122: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, IT'S ALL YOU.
01:40:20.623: >> Councilmember Lumm: I WOULD LIKE TO THANK DR. STULTS AND HER TERM WHO FOR ALL THE HARD WORK THAT WAS PUT INTO THE PLAN AND WHAT WE REQUESTED AT THE APRIL 20th MEETING. I WOULD SUPPORT A TABLING OR A POSTPONEMENT OF THIS UNTIL THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN HAS ADOPTED THEIR PLAN, WHICH BASED ON FEEDBACK WE HAVE RECEIVED IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION I ASKED, IT LOOKS LIKE LIKELY EARLY 2021. AND THE CITY HAVE A BETTER DEFINITION AROUND THE COVID-19 ADVERSE FINANCIAL IMPACTS. I WON'T PROPOSE THAT NOW, BECAUSE YOU SHOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON THE ITEM, BUT I WOULD SUPPORT IT. I WILL NOT SUPPORT TONIGHT ADOPTING THE PLAN THAT WE HAVE BEEN PRESENTED WITH. THERE ARE FOUR PRIMARY REASONS WHY AND I WILL TRY TO COVER THEM AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. FIRST, I BELIEVE THE PLAN ITSELF HAS FLAWS AND NEEDS TO BE CHANGED. IT SHOULD BE CHANGED TO BE MORE SURGICAL WITH PHASING FOCUSED FIRST ON HIGH LEVERAGE STRATEGIES AND ACTIONS. AND IT SHOULD BE CHANGED TO ELIMINATE THE ITEMS THAT HAVE MINIMAL GREEN HOUSE GAS REDUCTION LEVERS BUT ARE EITHER CONTROVERSIAL, WITH SIGNIFICANT COMMUNITY OPPOSITION, LIKE THE LAND USE ACTIONS OF BUY RIGHT DENSITY AND MIXED USE DENSITIES IN SINGLE FAMILY NEIGHBORHOODS OR INCLUDED PRIMARILY TO DEMONSTRATE LEADERSHIP LIKE THE SOLAR LANDFILL PROJECT. WE CANNOT AFFORD LOW LEVERAGE ITEMS AT ALL AND SHOULD BE FOCUSED FIRST ON HIGH LEVERAGE ITEMS. I WILL ALSO JUST NOTE THAT WHILE DR. STULTS STATED THIS EVENING THAT WE SHOULDN'T FOCUS ON THE ENTIRE PLAN AND MR. CRAWFORD ALSO STATED THAT NO PROJECT WOULD BE MOVED FORWARD WITHOUT FUNDING, IT HAS BEEN STATEBY DR. STULTS PREVIOUSLY ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS AND NUMEROUS PRESENTATIONS -- AND THIS IS ALSO STATED AND REFLECTED IN THE PLAN, AS WELL, THAT IT'S ALL OR NOTHING. AND THE RESPONSE IS TO VARIOUS QUESTIONS THAT I SUBMITTED REGARDING STRATEGIES THAT DIDN'T SCORE HIGHLY, THE RESPONSE WAS UNIFORMLY THAT IT'S CRITICAL TO LEAVE ALL OF THESE STRATEGIES AND ACTIONS IN THE PLAN. I ALSO APPRECIATE, I WILL JUST SAY, THE COMMENTS REGARDING -- BY DR. STULTS THAT THE OFFICE OF SUSTAINABILITY IS PARTICIPATING IN THE FINANCIAL RECOVERY PLAN BUT WILL ALSO NOTE THAT -- THAT COVID-19 ACTIONS ARE NOT REFLECTED. THERE ARE NO CUTS REFLECTED IN THE PLAN. SO BACK TO THE REASONS WHY I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS. THE SECOND REASON I CAN'T SUPPORT THE PLAN TONIGHT IS BECAUSE THE FUNDING PLAN WE WERE PROVIDED JUST IS NOT REALISTIC. IT ASSUMES THE AATA AND THE RTA WILL SOMEHOW MAGICAL E THERE COME UP WITH $700 MILLION IN THESE CHALLENGING FINANCIAL TIMES. AND FOR THE CITY'S PIECE, THE ROUGHLY $300 MILLION INCLUDING THE PARK AND RIDES, IT ASSUMES ABOUT $180 MILLION OR ALMOST 60% OF THE FUNDING WILL COME FROM FEDERAL GRANTS, AND THIS IS ON TOP OF A BIG ASK FOR A NEW TRAIN STATION. IT ALSO ASSUMES $45 MILLION OR 15% WILL COME FROM THE SAVINGS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SERVICE CONSOLIDATIONS RECOMMENDED IN THE SOLID WASTE PLAN. RESOURCE MANAGEMENT MAP. AND THAT'S A MAN THAT COUNCIL ALREADY TABLED AND MY SENSE IS THAT COUNCIL HAS NO INCLINATION TO APPROVE AS IT HAS BEEN PRESENTED. IT ALSO ASSUMES THAT WHAT DOESN'T MATERIALIZE ELSEWHERE CAN BE COVERED BY, QUOTE, REPRY REPRIOR ADPRIORITIZING THE BUDG. THAT'S NOT A PLAN. THERE'S NO MENTION OF THE NEW PROPERTY TAX MILLAGES, RTA, THATLY WILL BE REQUIRED IF WE ARE HONEST TO DELIVER THE PLAN. THE THIRD REASON I DON'T BELIEVE WE SHOULD ADOPT THIS TONIGHT IS WHAT WE KNOW AND DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE COVID-19 FINANCIAL IMPACTS. WE KNOW THE ADVERSE IMPACTS ON THE CITY WILL BE SIGNIFICANT. IN THE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. WHAT WE DON'T KNOW IS HOW SIGNIFICANT. HOW BAD IT COULD GET. IN MY VIEW, TO EMBARK ON A MAJOR NEW INITIATIVE AT THIS TIME, WHEN WE ARE MAKING CUTS ELSEWHERE, THIS DOES NOT MAKE SENSE AND IS NOT FISCALLITY RESPONSIBLE. THE PLAN ASSUMES THE CITY WILL BORROW ALMOST $50 MILLION. THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY TO BORROW NOW, WHERE THE INTEREST PAYMENTS ALONE WOULD BE $1.8 MILLION ANNUALLY. PLUS, THE PLAN ASSUMES DDA SUPPORT OF $1 MILLION A YEAR. AND I'M NOT SURE H HOW REALISTIC CONSIDERING HOW THE DDA HAS ITS OWN COVID-19 FINANCIAL CHALLENGES, AND IS ALSO COMMITTED TO PROVIDE SUBSTANTIAL HOUSING SUPPORT. I WOULD REFER TO SEE THE DDA FOCUSING ITS RESOURCES ON THE RECOVERY OF ITS BUSINESSES. THE FOURTH AND THE LAST REASON I DON'T BELIEVE WE SHOULD SUPPORT THIS SEASON IS THAT IT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE TO ADOPT A PLAN WHEN WE HAVE NO IDEA WITHIN 900-POUND GORILLA, THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN WILL BE DOING. AS I MENTIONED AT THE OUTSET, I WOULD SUPPORT TABLING THIS UNTIL WE HAVE U OF M'S PLAN, AND HAVE BETTER DEFINITION AROUND THE CITY'S FINANCIAL CONDITION, BUT IF WE VOTE TONIGHT, I'M SORRY, I CAN'T SUPPORT ADOPTING THIS PLAN. THANK YOU FOR LISTENING.
01:45:56.325: >> Mayor Taylor: I WILL GO I THINK WITH COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER AND THEN COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:46:01.531: >> Councilmember Hayner: OKAY. SO IS THIS AN APPROPRIATE TIME TO ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PLAN?
01:46:08.538: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
01:46:09.038: >> Councilmember Hayner:  IS THAT OKAY? THANKSDR. STULTS. I'M SORRY TO SEE WHAT YOU HAVE GOING THERE. I APPRECIATE YOU LOGGING IN HERE. SO SOME OF THESE MAY SOUND LIKE SIMPLE QUESTIONS BUT I'M -- SOME ARE FOR ME AND SOME I'M PASSING FORWARD, BRINGING FORWARD FROM CONSTITUENTS. SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THE STRATEGIES, JUST AS A PLACE TO START, I MEAN, TO BE HONEST, LIKE, I GOT QUITE A LIST. I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS APPROPRIATE, BUT -- SO JUST AS AN EXAMPLE OF THE TYPE OF QUESTIONS THAT I HAVE. SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT A STRATEGY, AND THE -- WE KNOW WHAT THE TOTAL COST IS. THAT'S TO IMPLEMENT THAT STRATEGY SO THAT IT'S UP AND RUNNING. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL EMISSIONS REDUCED, ONCE THAT STRATEGY IS UP AND RUNNING THAT IT WILL BE REDUCING THOSE EMISSIONS EVERY YEAR; IS THAT CORRECT? SO WE HAVE A TOTAL YEARLY CARBON LOAD AND IF WE WERE TO WAVE A MAGIC SUSTAINABILITY WAND AND EVERYTHING HAPPENED TOMORROW, THAT CHART WOULD BE ACCURATE MOVING FORWARD; IS THAT CORRECT?
01:47:12.368: >> JUST TO CLARIFY, ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THE CHART IN THE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY?
01:47:15.972: >> Councilmember Hayner: YEAH, LIKE PAGE 10, 11, THE ACTION SUMMARY TABLE AND SO ON?
01:47:19.909: >> YES, THAT ASSUMES THAT THE ACTIONS ARE IMPLEMENTED AND IT IS A YEAR OVER YEAR REDUCTION. IT'S ASSUMED THAT IT'S IMPLEMENTED IN THAT YEAR AND IT WILL ACCUMULATE OVER TIME.
01:47:32.121: >> Councilmember Hayner:  LIKE THE PAGE WE ARE ON, LIKE, WE HAVE I DON'T KNOW, BULK PURCHASE ENERGY EFFICIENCY 16.5%, AT $4 A TON. THAT'S 16.5% OF OUR TOTAL EMISSIONS REMOVED IN AN ONGOING MANNER, LIKE IF THAT BULK MOST VALUPURCHASE IS MADE OR WE HAVEA GREENBELT HOUSING -- WELL, THAT HAS ZERO.
01:47:57.847: >> RIGHT.
01:47:58.147: >> Councilmember Hayner: LET'S SAY LE D. LIGHTING IS FULLY IN PLACE. THAT'S 6.5% OF OUR TOTAL EMISSIONS MOVING FORWARD, AS LONG AS THAT STAYS IN PLACE; IS THAT CORRECT?
01:48:09.025: >> THAT'S RIGHT.
01:48:10.493: >> Councilmember Hayner: OKAY. SO THEN WHEN WE SCROLL DOWN TO -- I SPENT SOME OF THE TIME TRYING TO COORDINATE THE BUDGET ESTIMATES AND THE CITY FUNDING SOURCES THAT YOU PUT TOGETHER WITH THIS. SO WHEN WE LOOK AT, YOU KNOW, OFFSET ACTIONS OR -- I MEAN, I WILL JUST PICK ONE. LIKE -- WELL, LIKE WE HAVE THESE CITY GRANTS -- THAT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS BECAUSE IT'S A RECURRING GRANT, BUT THE COSTS WHEN YOU GO TO THE BOTTOM AND YOU LOOK AT YOUR TOTAL CITY OPERATING COSTS BY YEAR, AND SO WE ADD THEM UP, ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE ROW, THAT'S TOTAL COST OF THE PROGRAM ADDED UP ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE ROAD FOR TEN YEARS, CORRECT, JUST LIKE YOU WOULD WITH A SPREADSHEET?
01:48:54.437: >> CORRECT. IT WOULD BE THE NET IMPACT IS RIGHT. SO, YES, YOU COULD ADD IT UP ACROSS THE BOARD BUT I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE'S DIFFERENT ROWS, RIGHT? SO THE OPERATING COSTS AND THEN THERE'S ESTIMATED SAVINGS. IF THERE ARE SAVINGS OR ADDITIONAL COST FOR OPERATING THAT PARTICULAR ACTION, THEN THERE'S DEBT SERVICE AND SO THE BEST ROW TO LOOK AT, IN THIS SCENARIO, WHICH IS ALL THIS IS, IS JUST A SCENARIO IS WHAT IS LABELED AS D, THE NET CITY IMPACT.
01:49:20.563: >> Councilmember Hayner: OKAY. SO THAT'S WHAT WE ARE PAYING THAT YEAR AND WHATEVER IS CONSIDERED THAT YEAR.
01:49:25.601: >> YES.
01:49:25.868: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES, THE CITY ONLY?
01:49:28.604: >> CORRECT. BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE -- YEAH.
01:49:30.906: >> Councilmember Hayner:  AND GENERAL FUND I UNDERSTAND. MIL IS MILLAGE DIVERTED. OKAY. I MEAN, I -- YOU KNOW, LIKE, I COME TO SOMETHING LIKE -- I JUST -- I'M UN UNITED STATING TT EXECUTIVE SUMMARY -- I'M USING THAT EXECUTIVE SUMMARY. ON PAGE 11, WE TALK ABOUT -- YOU KNOW THE END OF THE PROGRAM WE DON'T KNOW HOW WE WILL STAND AND HOW EFFECTIVE THIS HAS BEEN AND HOW OUR PARTNERS HAVE BEEN GETTING ON BOARD AND SO ON, AND WE TALK ABOUT, YOU KNOW, THIS PURCHASE OF OFFSETS AND SO, YOU KNOW, 9.4 MILLION SOMETHING FOR THE FIRST YEAR, I THINK IT WAS OF PURCHASING THE OFFSETS. AND -- AND THAT REPRESENTED SOME -- YOU KNOW, SOME PERCENTAGE OF THE TOTAL. I LOST MY PAGE ON THERE. THE PERCENTAGE OF THE TOTAL --
01:50:24.493: >> 14%.
01:50:24.760: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES, 14%, 13 ODD PERCENT. I KNOW IT WILL SOUND LIKE A NAIVE QUESTION. IF WE PURCHASE THE 13% OR 14% OF THE OFFSETS FOR $9 MILLION, FOR YEAR'S WORTH OF THE MAKEUP OF THE OFFSETS OF WHAT OUR PROGRAM HAD DONE BY THE TIME IT CAME TO THAT TIME, RIGHT, THAT'S WHAT THAT STANDS FOR? OKAY. SO --
01:50:48.684: >> THAT'S YEARLY. I THINK YOU SAID --
01:50:51.187: >> Councilmember Hayner:  IT'S YEARLY. SO WE WILL HAVE TO PURCHASE THAT 9.4 MERCHANDISE ISN'T IN THERE EVERY YEAR, IT'S JUST AT THE END OF THE PROGRAM TO KIND OF MAKE UP FOR EVERYTHING?
01:50:58.861: >> YEAH, IT'S TO GET TO THE END AND SEE HOW SUCCESSFUL WE ARE, UNLESS WE WANTED TO GO EARLIER. WE COULD CERTAINLY PURCHASE OFFSETS EARLIER IF WE WANTED TO BUT IT WAS TO INVEST IN THE PROGRAMS AND THE SUPPORT AS WE COULD LOCALLY AND OFFSET WITH THE LAST MILE, IF YOU WILL.
01:51:15.344: >> Councilmember Hayner:  AND THAT WOULD ALSO -- AND THAT REQUEST FOR SUPPORT WOULD ALSO INCLUDE THINGS LIKE, YOU KNOW, IT WAS THE UNIVERSITY ON BOARD AND AATA AND SO ON? THANKS. I STARTED DOING THE NUMBERS ON THAT. I WAS LIKE, WELL, IF IT'S $10 MILLION TO BUY THAT FOR A YEAR. IT WAS LIKE $62 MILLION A YEAR TO OFFSET OUR WAY OUT OF THIS, WHICH IS WAY MORE THAN -- NOT USELESS, BUT NOT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR, YOU KNOW?
01:51:39.502: >> THERE ARE CO-BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH IT, FOR EXAMPLE.
01:51:43.272: >>>> Councilmember Hayner:  I DON'T KNOW. BECAUSE OF WHAT COUNCILMEMBER LUMM SAID, I HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS. I DON'T WANT TO DRAG THIS OUT. I FEEL UNPREPARED TO VOTE ON THIS REAL LeBECAUSE WE HAVE A LOT OF COMPELLING EMAILS ON BOTH SIDES OF IT AND I HAD EXCELLENT PHONE CALLS ON THIS ISSUE AND I HAD A REALLY NICE CALL FROM A UNIT AT U OF M, WHO NOT ONLY WANTED TO KNOW HOW WE STOOD ON FUNDING OF IT AND WHAT I CARED ABOUT IN THE PLAN AND HOW I FELT THE PLAN WAS PRIORITIZED BUT HE WANTED TO KNOW HOW COULD HE GET INVOLVED IN HELPING THE UNIVERSITY BE MORE INVOLVED? AND I REFERRED HIM OVER TO YOUR PAGE AND SOME OTHER THINGS. I KNOW THERE ARE SOME GROUPS ON CAMPUS THAT ARE WORKING HARD TO PUSH THE UNIVERSITY IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION, WHICH IS OUR DIRECTION. AND I KNOW THAT PEOPLE KNOW IN THEIR HEART THAT THIS IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. AND THAT'S WHY PEOPLE ARE UPSET ABOUT THE POTENTIAL OF IT NOT BEING FUNDED FULLY AND ADOPTED FULLY TONIGHT. BUT I -- I -- LIKE COUNCILWOMAN LUMM SAID, I HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT SO MANY THINGS LIKE WHEN I LOOK AT THE LAND USE ELEMENT, THAT IS HIGHLIGHTED IN THE INTRODUCTION LETTER, BUT ONLY REPRESENTS ONE-TENth OF 1% OF THE TOTAL CARBON EMISSIONS MOVING FORWARD, I THINK, IS THAT -- DOES THAT BELONG IN HERE? IS THIS THE RIGHT PLACE FOR IT? AND SO I HAVE CALL KINDS OF QUESTIONS LIKE THAT. I'M WONDERING IF I SHOULDN'T -- I WOULDN'T MOVE TO TABLE THIS, BECAUSE I THINK -- I THINK WE DO NEED ACTION. SO MUCH SO THAT I SUPPORTED CHANGING IT FROM 20 P 2035 TO 2, AND I NO HE IT PUT A LOT OF PRESSURE ON YOUR OFFICE. I KNOW WOULD PREFER TO POSTPONE THIS TO THE JUNE 1st MEETING. IF ONLY FOR MY OWN -- TO GET MY OWN QUESTIONS ANSWERED SO I CAN FEEL LIKE I CAN WHOLEHEARTEDLY SUPPORT THIS. I KNOW IT SOUNDED LIKE A QUESTION. I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE POSTPONE ADOPTION UNTIL THE JUNE JUNE 1st MEETING.
01:53:42.157: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE A SECOND? SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER NELSON. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, YOU STILL HAVE THE FLOOR WITH RESPECT TO POSTPONEMENT.
01:53:50.699: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU. AS I SAID, IT'S JUST SO THAT I UNDERSTAND WHAT IS IN AND WHAT IS OUT AND THEN I GUESS MY FINAL ROUND OF QUESTIONS SINCE WE ARE DISCUSSING THE POSTPONEMENT WOULD BE THIS. THIS PLAN, TAKEN AS ITS HOLE LIKE YOU HAVE ASKED US TO, HAS GUIDELINES -- HAS GUIDELINES, SOLUTIONS, GUIDE POSTS, METRICS AND SO ON, COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH IT, AND THANK YOU FOR THAT. ARE THERE -- WHAT IS YOUR ABILITY IN THIS STATED LIVING DOCUMENT TO ADD AND REMOVE THINGS? LIKE I SPOKE AT A PREVIOUS MEETING ABOUT THE PR ANGLE, WHERE IF WE ARE GOING TO SHOW LEADERSHIP ON THIS, WE NEED PR BACKING AND I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S FUNDED IN HERE, PUBLIC RELATIONS BACKING. ANY TIME WE TAKE A MOVE, THE REST OF THE WORLD KNOWS THIS IS WHAT CLIMATE ACTION LEADERSHIP LOOKS LIKE. AND SO THERE'S -- THERE'S THINGS I WOULD LIKE TO PUT IN AND THINGS I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE OUT AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE MECHANISM FOR DOING THAT.
01:54:47.222: >> YEAH. IF I MAY, SO THE INTENT WITH THE GOVERNANCE DOCUMENT WAS TO OUTLINE HOW WE CAN MAKE REVISIONS AND SO THE PROPOSAL IS THAT ANY ACTION CAN BE CONSIDERED THAT, WE JUST RUN IT THROUGH A PRIORITIZATION FRAMEWORK TO MAKE SURE IT HAS GREEN HOUSE GAS REDUCTION, AND ALIGNS WITH THE COST VALUES, ET CETERA, SO THAT WE ARE HAVING AN APPLES TO APPLES COMPARISON AS IDEAS COME AND THAT THE REALITY IN THAT GOVERNANCE MODEL ALSO TALKS ABOUT STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITIES. WE MAY FIND THAT IN COVID INVESTMENT SCENARIOS THERE ARE THINGS THAT THE GOVERNMENT WANTS TO MOVE FORWARD THAT WE PRIORITIZE DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE THERE ARE RESOURCES TO DO THAT AND SO THE GOVERNANCE DOCUMENT WAS MEANT TO ADDRESS H HOW WE WOULD MAKE THOSE CHANGES AND WE FULLY EXPECT WHY WE WOULD MAKE THE CHANGES. IT'S REALLY HARD TO IMAGINE THAT WE WOULD ACHIEVE CARBON NEUTRALITY WITHOUT 100% CLEAN RENEWABLE ENERGY AND WITHOUT PHASING NATURAL GAS OUT. HOW WE GET THERE IS FAR MORE FLEXIBLE. SO THAT'S WHY THE ELEVATION WAS ELEVATED AND FOCUS ON THE STRATEGIES AND LET THE ACTIONS BE THE MUCH MORE FLUID DYNAMIC AND THE GOVERNANCE DOCUMENT AND THE PRIORITIZATION FRAMEWORK, GIVE US THE MECHANISMS TO MAKE THOSE CHANGES.
01:55:55.924: >> Councilmember Hayner: OKAY. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU FOR CLEARING THAT UP. I GUESS I'M GOING TO SUPPORT MY OWN MOVE TO PUT IT OFF ONE MORE WEEK SO I CAN FEEL CONFIDENT THAT I'M DOING THE RIGHT THING AND -- AND HAVE WHAT I WANT IN AND WHAT I WANT OUT BEFORE I -- BEFORE I SAY YES TO IT, BECAUSE I KNOW IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO. I JUST -- I -- I HAVE QUESTIONS AND SO I APOLOGIZE FOR NOT BEING MORE READY TO VOTE TONIGHT, BUT I'M NOT, AND SO I WILL SUPPORT ONE PASS TO THE NEXT COUNCIL MEETING FOR THIS ITEM. THANK YOU.
01:56:28.991: >> Mayor Taylor: I HAVE LUMM, NELSON, SMITH, RAMLAWI, IN REVERSE ORDER ON THE QUEUE, I WILL CLEAR THAT QUEUE IN THE THEORY THAT IT WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MAIN MOTION, BECAUSE I BELIEVE IT WAS. IS THERE ANYBODY WHO WOULD LIKE TO DO THE POSTPONEMENT. I HAVE PRESERVED RAMLAWI, SMITH, NELSON AND LUMM IN THE EVENT THAT POSTPOPEMENT FAILS. COUNCILMEMBER NELSON? YOU ARE ON MUTE.
01:56:54.349: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I KNOW. SORRY ABOUT THAT. I ACTUALLY -- I UNDERSTAND WHERE COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER IS COMING FROM. I'M SYMPATHETIC. HE WANT TO COMMENT OPEN A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT -- ON A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT STUNNED ME. I NEED TO PREFACE ME BY THANKING DR. STULTS BECAUSE SHE SPENT QUITE A BIT OF TIME TALKING TO ME ABOUT THINGS I HAD NOTICED, CONCERNS THAT I HAD ABOUT HOW THIS HAS BEEN PRESENTED TO US. I -- COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER COMMENTED ON SOMETHING THAT I THINK PEOPLE IN THE PUBLIC NEED TO BE AWARE OF WHICH IS THAT THIS DOCUMENT COMES AT CLIMATE ACTION FROM A WHOLE BUNCH OF DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS AND ONE TINY PIECE IS LAND USE. YES, LAND USE IS STATED UP FRONT AS, LIKE, NUMBER ONE, THAT'S WHAT WE GOT TO DO IN THE INTRODUCTORY LETTER TO THIS REPORT, WHICH I FOUND ABSOLUTELY BIZARRE AND I THINK A LOT OF RESIDENTS FOUND VERY CONCERNING BECAUSE WE ALSO ARE LEARNING IN THESE LAST FEW WEEKS OF BUDGET ADJUSTMENTS THAT THE MASTER PLAN PROCESS IS HAVING TO BE BUMPED FORWARD. WE CAN'T PURSUE THAT BECAUSE IT'S -- IT'S TOO MUCH OF AN EXPENSE. AND SO WHAT LOOKS LIKE TO A LOT OF PEOPLE IS WE'RE MAKING A VERY BIG STATEMENT ABOUT CHANGES AND WHAT OUR CITY IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE AND SORT OF A SIDEWAYS DIRECTION ON A TOPIC WHERE IT IS -- IT IS ADMITTEDLY GOING TO CONTRIBUTE ONLY A SMALL PIECE. AND I GUESS THE ONLY OTHER COMMENT THAT I WOULD MAKE IN SUPPORT OF THE POSTPONEMENT IS I DO THINK IT'S -- IT'S VALID FOR US TO HAVE A LITTLE MORE TIME TO THINK ON THIS THAN THE LESS THAN 24 HOURS THAT WE HAD. GIVEN THE FACT THAT A LOT OF HOW WE ARE LIVING IS CHANGING SUCH A LOT. YOU KNOW, LEGITIMATELY WE NEED TO REDUCE OUR RELIANCE ON COMBUSTION ENGINES HASN'T THAT WAS THE HE CONNECTION TO THE LAD USE IDEAS. I KNOW IN MY OWN HOUSEHOLD AND I KNOW OTHER PEOPLE ARE OBSERVING IT AS WELL. MY HUSBAND'S FUTURE AS A COMMUTER IS UNLIKELY TO CONTINUE. I HAVE NEVER -- I COMMUTE TO MY BACKYARD. BUT I THINK THAT SOCIETY IS CHANGING QUITE A LOT, AND THERE ARE JUST A LOT OF CHANGES THAT I THINK THAT NONE OF US CAN QUITE IMAGINE AT THIS POINT, BECAUSE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE ARE INCREASINGLY GOING TO BE WORKING FROM HOME, THE AMOUNT OF OFFICE SPACE THAT'S DOWNTOWN THAT MAYBE WON'T BE NECESSARY ANYMORE. AND SO I GUESS MY BIGGEST CONCERN IS HOW THIS WAS FRAMED IN A WAY THAT STRUCK ME AS SOMEWHAT MISLEADING AND JUST SORT OF SURPRISING. SO I SUPPORT A POSTPONEMENT JUST FOR US TO HAVE A LITTLE CLEARER DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT EXACTLY WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. THANKS.
01:59:51.860: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
01:59:57.399: >> Councilmember Hayner: SORRY, A LITTLE LAG THERE. I WANT TO MAKE CLEAR THAT MY POSTPONEMENT IS FOR A DATE CERTAIN. ITS FOR A MEETING OF JUNE JUNE 1st AND JUST SUPPORT OF THAT NOTION, I JUST -- I KNOW THIS WILL SOUND ODD FOR SOMEBODY WHO HAS SO MANY QUESTIONS BUT I REALLY -- I REALLY WANT THE TIME TO TRY AND MAKE THIS ALL I CAN TO MAKE IT THE BEST THING I CAN BEFORE IT GETS APPROVED BECAUSE THAT'S GOING TO BE IT. I KNOW THAT WE'RE GOING TO RUN WITH IT, YOU KNOW? AND I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY CHANCES I WILL HAVE TO MAKE CHANGES MOVING FORWARD OR WHAT THE -- I'M STILL TRYING TO GET MY GRIP AROUND THE GOVERNMENT'S MODEL. I APOLOGIZE. I HAD SO MANY PROBLEMS GETTING ONLINE AT THE START OF THE MEETING. AND I MISSED THE PRESENTATION. MAYBE WE WILL HAVE A CALL THIS WEEK AND YOU CAN ANSWER ALL OF MY QUESTIONS OUT OF THE CHUTE. AND I WOULD THANK PEOPLE FOR THE SUPPORT ON THIS AND PUT IT OUT THERE THAT IT'S -- IT'S NOT A TABLING. IT'S NOT GOING AWAY. IT'S TO GET OUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED AND GO ON WITH THE BUSINESS OF THE BUDGET TEMPERATURE. THANK YOU.
02:01:05.667: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD. YOU ARE ON MUTE.
02:01:10.839: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES. I GUESS I'M REALLY TROUBLED AND I HAVE SAID THIS BEFORE, BUT I LIVE IN THE PASSIVE SOLAR HOUSE. I DRIVE AN ELECTRIC CAR. I HAVE AN INDUCTION RANGE. AND I WANT TO SUPPORT THIS. BUT I THINK IT IS VERY, VERY BAD GOVERNANCE TO GIVE US A PLAN ON SUNDAY AND BULLY US INTO APPROVE IT ON MONDAY OR WHERE THE OPTICS ARE WE REALLY DON'T SUPPORT IT. AND THAT'S NOT TRUE. I QUESTION THE MOTIVE OF PUTTING THIS OPE ON THE AGENDA, 24 HOURS WHEN THIS DESERVES A DISCUSSION AND THE ABILITY FOR US TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S IN THE NEW PLAN. AND I WOULD SUPPORT A POSTPONEMENT UNTIL JUNE 1st. THANK YOU.
02:02:02.691: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
02:02:09.865: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU. YEAH, I -- IT DIDN'T SIT WELL WITH ME EITHER THAT WE RECEIVED THIS AT ABOUT 10:00 LAST NIGHT. I -- I DIDN'T DISCOVER IT UNTIL THIS MORNING AND I HAD NO TIME TO LOOK AT IT, ALTHOUGH THE COVER NOTE FROM DR. STULTS INDICATED THERE WERE NO SUBSTANTIVE CHANGES TO THE MAP THAT WE RECEIVED PREVIOUSLY. AND SO I THINK IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR MORE DETAIL, WE HAVE IT AT THIS POINT. I WILL JUST SAY TOO THAT -- SO THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK ABOUT PRIORITIZATION AND I SUBMITTED A LOT OF QUESTIONS OVER THE PERIOD THAT WE HAVE BEEN REVIEWING THIS AND IN RESPONSE TO THE QUESTIONS I FOLLOWED UP ON TO DRILL DOWN ON WHAT PRIORITIZATION MEANS, I WILL SAY I THINK THE PRIORITIZATION FRAMEWORK IS ENLIGHTENING IN THE PRIORITIZATION AND THE SCORING DEMONSTRATES WHAT I SAID BEFORE, THAT THERE ARE MAJOR DISPARITIES BETWEEN -- IN COST BENEFIT, AND THAT AN ALL OR NOTHING APPROACH DOES NOT MAKE SENSE. THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE HERE. IF YOU THINK THAT THERE'S A LOT OF DOUBLE SPEAK, I GOT TO TELL YOU. WE ARE TOLD ON ONE HAND, OH, IF YOU ADOPT THIS AND APPROVE THE PLAN, YOU ARE NOT REALLY ADOPTING THE WHOLE PLAN. WE WILL GIVE -- WE WILL BRING IT TO YOU IN PHASES, WHATEVER. AND YES. I ASKED ABOUT THINGS LIKE -- LET'S SEE, WHERE DO I START? THE -- I ASKED ABOUT -- I'M LOOKING FOR MY QUESTIONS. THE LAND USE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE INCLUDED. AGAIN, THE HOUSING DENSITY, THE NEIGHBORHOOD MIXED USE, THOSE THINGS SCORED POORLY. AND THEY ARE -- IT WAS CONTROVERSIAL. I THINK THERE ARE VERY FEW CITIZENS WHO KNOW THAT THAT'S IN HERE. AND SO I ASKED WOULD STAFF AGREE IT MIGHT MAKE SENSE FOR THE MANAGEMENT PLAN? RESPONSE, IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE THEM ON THE TABLE. ENERGY DISCLOSURE. THAT WAS -- THAT SCORED POORLY AND IT WAS ACTUALLY RANKED CLOSE TO THE B BOTTOM. STRATEGY IFI FIVE AS A WHOLE DIT RESPOND. STAFF BELIEVES IT'S CRITICAL TO LEAVE STRATEGY FIVE IN THE PLAN. THE LANDFILL SOLAR PROJECT DID NOT FAIR WELL IN THE SCORING AND IT'S A BIG T TICKET ITEM AS WE L KNOW, ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY IT WAS NOT DISCLOSED AND I ASKED ABOUT THIS. WHY IS THE CONSTRUCTION COST ESTIMATE NOT INCLUDED IN PART OF THE ANALYSIS. AND THE RESPONSE WE DISCOVERED TO THIS QUESTION, THE CITY IS PAYING FOR THE LAND PHIL CONSTRUCTION COSTS. WESTERLY -- LANDFILL CONSTRUCTION COSTS. WE ARE PAYING IT OVER TIME, INSTEAD OF UP FRONT. THAT'S A $50 MILLION PRICE TAG. IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE CITY TO LEAD BY EXAMPLE. THIS INCLUDES FOCUSING ON OUR MUNICIPAL OPERATIONS. AGAIN, PUSHBACK, PUSHBACK, PUSHBACK. IT'S CLEARLY THE RESPONSES HAVE INDICATED YOU HAVE TO TAKE THE WHOLE EN ENCHILADA AND I ASKED T DOES IT MEAN TO REPRIORITIZE THE CITY BUDGET WHAT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED HERE IS THAT SINCE THERE'S $6.8 MILLION A YEAR ALREADY IN THE BUDGET WHEN WE KNOW IS DUBIOUS AT THIS POINT. THE ANNUAL NEED IS ROUGHLY $2 TO $3 MILLION AND FOLKS ARE WILLING TO PAY MORE THAN THAT IS THE RESPONSE WE GOT. AND THEN I ASKED HOW MUCH IN TOTAL WOULD WE BORROW AND THE SCENARIO THAT'S PRESENTED US, IT SAYS WE WILL BORROW JUST UNDER $50 MILLION. AGAIN, WITH INTEREST -- ANNUAL INTEREST PAYMENTS OF 1.8. SO, YOU KNOW, SO WE WILL BORROW OR ISSUE DEBT TO PAY FOR THINGS LIKE -- THE CITY CAPITAL LINE THAT INCLUDES 4.9 MILLION FOR THE ELECTRIFICATION AND 2.5 FOR LED LIGHTING AND 1.6 FOR NON-MOTORIZED PLAN. SO IN TERMS OF THE PRIORITIZATION, ITEMS WITH LOWER SCORES, THEY ARE ALL IN HERE. AND WE HAVE RECEIVED RESPONSES INDICATING THAT THEY NEED TO BE HERE. AND THE STIGMA THAT WE ARE ALREADY 6.8 MILLION IN THE FISCAL '21 BUDGET FOR A2ZERO, I THINK IS VERY KEY IN THE SENSE THAT I DON'T THINK IT'S ACCURATE BECAUSE IT'S BEING USED TO SUGGEST THERE'S A LOT LESS CITY SPENDING REQUIRED THAN WE THINK, AND, IN FACT, IF THAT IS TRUE, THEN CERTAINLY WE CAN'T SAY WE ARE NOT SPENDING MUCH ON CLIMATE ACTION. THE FUNDING PLAN IS NOT REALISTIC AND -- YOU KNOW, ALL OF THESE ITEMS IN HERE, IT'S -- YOU KNOW, IT'S, AGAIN, ALL OR NOTHING. AND I DO THINK THAT THE MATRIX, AND THE PRIORITIZATION PLAN ARE VERY ENLIGHTENING AND I WILL JUST SAY THAT ON FRIDAY, I HAD A -- I RECEIVED A PRESENTATION FROM DT EX EX AND I KNOW EARLIEN THE WEEK, THE MAYOR AND PERHAPS DR. STULTS DID TOO. I WILL SEND THAT INFORMATION TO COUNSEL SIX I ALSO HAD LOTS OF QUESTIONS. FOLKS I'M HEARING FROM ARE ASKING THE QUESTION I HEAR MORE THAN ANYTHING, FRANKLY, FROM MOST OF MY CONSTITUENTS, THEY WANT TO KNOW WHAT THIS IS GOING TO COST THEM. I HAVE UNABLE TO GIVE THEM A CLEAR ANSWER. AND SO I AM TRYING TO GATHER AS MUCH DATA FROM, YES, DTE INCLUDED TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION BECAUSE WE ARE ASKING PEOPLE TO, YOU KNOW, TURN OFF THEIR NATURAL GAS USAGE AND CONVERT TO ALL ELECTRIC APPLIANCES, TO HEAT THEIR HOMES, THEIR RESTAURANTS AND JUST ONE EXAMPLE. SO DTE DID AN ANALYSIS OF A TYPICAL -- LET'S SAY TYPICAL RESTAURANT. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI CAN CORRECT ME OPEN THIS. THEY USED A 6,000 SQUARE FOOT RESTAURANT WITH TYPICAL EQUIPMENT. TODAY -- AT TODAY'S ENERGY PRICES, THIS WOULD RESULT IN A 44% OR $17,000 A YEAR INCREASE IN ENERGY BILLS WITH MOST OF THAT -- THIS IS DIRECTLY FROM DT EX COMING FROM COOK -- DTE AND THAT IS COMING FROM COOKING AND WAWATER INCREASE. IT DOESN'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT REPLACING APPLIANCES, WHICH COULD COST AS MUCH AS $160,000 TO RHETT TRE FIT AN EXISTING RESTAURANT OF THAT SIZE. ANY NEW RESTAURANT IT WAS NOTED WOULD SEE THE ENERGY COST INCREASE OF 44% BUT NOT THE UP FRONT COST DIFFERENCE. THAT'S FROM DTE. AND SO THERE'S SO MUCH TO CONSIDER HERE AND I THINK THAT POSTPONING JUST TO JUNE 1st, I AGAIN, IT'S -- WE'RE MISSING THE MARK BECAUSE THE -- THE CONTRIBUTOR OF ONE-THIRD OF THE GAS EMISSIONS WILL NOT COME FORWARD WITH A PLAN UNTIL LATE 2020, EARLY 2021. WE'RE DEALING WITH COVID AND ALL OF THOSE UNKNOWNS AND, YOU KNOW, AT THE VERY LEAST, I THINK IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO HAVE PUBLIC HEARINGS TO HEAR FROM BUSINESSES.
02:09:56.931: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER, I HAVEN'T BEEN KEEPING TRACK OF TIME BUT MY SUSPICION IS --
02:10:01.169: >> Councilmember Lumm: GOT IT. THANK YOU.
02:10:04.005: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
02:10:06.741: >> Councilmember Eaton: SHE WAS ON A ROLL! SO I WILL THE SO THE POSTPONEMENT BECAUSE I HAVE LIKE A THOUSAND QUESTIONS THAT ARISE FROM JUST A CURSORY REVIEW OF THE 138-PAGE DOCUMENT THAT WE RECEIVED LAST NIGHT AND SO I -- I WOULD LIKE TO SUPPORT A PLAN -- A PLAN THAT REPLIES TOO MUCH ON DENSITY AS A SOLUTION IS NOT GOING TO FLY WELL WITH ME BUT I DO HAVE ONE QUESTION OF DR. STULTS. IF WE ADOPT THE A2ZERO PLAN, DOES THAT BECOME PART OF OUR MASTER PLAN?
02:10:45.647: >> NOT BY DEFAULT. I THINK WE WOULD HAVE TO DIRECT THAT WE WANTED IT TO BE.
02:10:49.350: >> Councilmember Eaton: OKAY. THANK YOU. SO, AGAIN, I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THE POSTPONEMENT.
02:10:55.723: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCIL MEMBER GRAND. YOU ARE ON MUTE.
02:11:00.161: >> Councilmember Grand: NO, I'M UNMUTING. I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING THE POSTPONEMENT. I WILL TAKE COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER AT HIS WORD THAT HE REALLY DOES WANT THE TIME TO GO FORWARD AND I RESPECT THAT. THE ISSUE I HAVE IS THAT I DON'T -- I'M NOT OPTIMISTIC THAT JUST BECAUSE WE TAKE ANOTHER COUPLE OF WEEKS THAT WE ARE GOING TO GET TO BE ADOPTING THIS PLAN BASED ON SOME OF THE OTHER COMMENTS THAT I'M HEARING. YOU KNOW, I REALLY DO THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, IF WE LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF THIS, WE PASSED A RESOLUTION SAYING WE HAD A CLIMATE EMERGENCY. WE UNANIMOUSLY ASKED FOR A PLAN. WE GOT AN EXCELLENT PLAN, BUT THEN WE WANTED SOMETHING ABOUT PRIORITIZATION. AND I THINK DR. STULTS, IF IT'S NOT CLEAR, FROM JUST WATCHING HER SITTING HERE AND WHAT SHE CAME BACK TO US WITH IN JUST A FEW WEEKS THAT SHE'S ACTUALLY SUPERWOMAN. SHE YET AGAIN CAME BACK AND GAVE US EXACTLY WHAT WE ASKED FOR IN RECORD TIME. AND -- BUT YET WE ARE GOING TO PUT IT OFF AGAIN INSTEAD OF TRUST THAT THIS IS A LIVING, BREATHING PLAN, AND HEAR FROM OUR CONSTITUENTS THAT THERE WERE MANY OF THEM THAT WE HAVE HEARD FROM IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS WHO HAVE BEEN ASKING US BECAUSE OF COVID TO PLEASE PASS THIS PLAN, THAT THIS IS AN EMERGENCY THAT'S NOT GOING AWAY, THAT IT'S REVEALING MANY OF THE REASONS WHY WE PASSED THIS -- WHY WE PASS THIS CLIMATE EMERGENCY IN THE FIRST PLACE. SO DR. STULTS, I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK. I HOPE THAT BECKETT CAN GET TO SLEEP SOON. AND I JUST WOULD ALSO LIKE US TO -- OH, AND REALLY, THAT WHAT THIS IS, IT'S NOT ABOUT -- IT'S NOT ABOUT CLIMATE AND SUPPORTING CLIMATE. IT'S ABOUT NOT BEING IN SUPPORT OF DE DENSITY OR OR AS COUNCILMCOUNCILMEMBER EATON CALM HIGHRISE CHICKEN COOPS.
02:13:07.655: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ITH.
02:13:13.261: >> Councilmember Smith: I WANT TO SAY, MISSY, DR. STULTS, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR GETTING ALL OF THIS INFORMATION BACK TO YOU. I REALIZE HOW MUCH WORK WENT INTO THIS. I WILL SUPPORT POSTPONEMENT, BECAUSE I THINK IT'S USEFUL TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS, BUT I -- I DO WANT TO REMIND MY COLLEAGUES THAT, YOU KNOW, WE DECLARED A CLIMATE EMERGENCY AND SAID WE WANT TO GET THE CARBON THAT NEUTRAL BY 2030 AND THAT'S GOING TO BE REALLY, REALLY HARD DOING THINGS THAT REQUIRE US TO DO REALLY -- MAKE REALLY HARD DECISIONS. YOU KNOW, WHAT DR. STULTS AND HER TEAM HAVE GIVEN US IS A BLUEPRINT, A PLAYBOOK OF HOW WE CAN GET THERE. AND I THINK TAKING THINGS OUT IMPACTS WHETHER WE ARE GOING TO -- WHEN AND WHETHER WE WILL BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE C CARBON NEUTRALITY. I THINK IF HE WITH WANT TO BACK THINGS OUT THEN WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE IMPACT OF BEING ABLE TO ACHIEVE CARBON NEUTRALITY AND, YOU KNOW, BE VERY HONEST WITH THE PUBLIC WHO HAS INVESTED AN AWFUL LOT IN THIS PROCESS TO SAY, HEY, IF WE TAKE X OUT, THAT MEANS WE DON'T PROJECT THAT WE CAN HIT CARBON NEUTRALITY UNTIL 2033 OR 2035 OR 2050. I THINK THAT THAT NEEDS TO BE AN HONEST PART OF THE DISCUSSION. I THINK ULTIMATELY FOR ME, THIS PLAN IS ABOUT INVESTING IN A DIFFERENT FUTURE. YOU KNOW? I THINK IF WE WANT TO FOCUS SIMPLY ON INVESTING IN THE SYSTEMS THAT HAVE GOTTEN US TO THIS POINT, CONVENTIONAL FOSSIL FUEL-BASED RELIANCE, THE SYSTEMS THAT HAVE CREATED VAST INEQUALITY AND INJUSTICE IN OUR WORLD, I THINK IF THAT'S WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO GET BACK TO, IF THAT'S OUR BASELINE, THEN IT'S FLAWED, YOU KNOW THIS IS REALLY AN OPPORTUNITY TO INVEST IN IT, IN SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND BETTER FOR EVERYBODY. AND I THINK IT'S NOT HYPERBOLIC TO SAY THIS MAY BE OUR LAST OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT. SO I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THE -- THE POSTPONEMENT THIS EVENING. BUT I -- I THINK THAT ADOPTING THIS IS ESSENTIAL AND, YOU KNOW, NECESSARY FIRST STEP, AND I LOOK FORWARD TO DOING THAT AT THE FIRST MEETING IN JUNE.
02:15:42.376: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
02:15:43.244: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YEAH, I'M SORRY WITH ALL THE DISCUSSIONS, YOU KNOW, MY QUESTION WAS THE POSTPONEMENT WAS FOR THE FIRST WEEK IN JUNE?
02:15:50.384: >> Mayor Taylor: IT IS.
02:15:52.620: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I MEAN DO WE REALISTICALLY THINK WE WILL HAVE OUR MINDS WRAPPED AROUND THIS BY THE FIRST WEEK OF JUPPE. JUNE. IT'S ONLY 12 DAYS A WAY, 13 DAYS AWAY, IT'S A SHORT TIME BETWEEN NOW AND THE NEXT COUNCIL MEETING. YOU KNOW, I'M TORN BECAUSE I HEAR MY CONSTITUENTS. I KNOW THAT WE HAVE PASSED CLIMATE EMERGENCY BACK IN NOVEMBER. WE HAVE ASKED MISSY -- DR. STULTS TO DO A LOT OF WORK AND HER STAFF IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. I THINK THAT IT ISN'T WHAT WE WANT NECESSARILY YET BECAUSE THERE IS SO MUCH WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND IT ENCOMPASSES SO MUCH DIFFERENT PARTS OF GOVERNMENT AND POLICY. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT. IT TRANSECTS EVERYTHING WITH ONE DOCUMENT. SO IT HAS A LOT OF UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. IT HAS A LOT OF CONSEQUENCES AND IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR US WHEN WE HAVE TO MAKE THESE SEISMIC SHIFTS, THESE BIG, BIG ADAPTATIONS, WHEN WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES WILL BE, BUT WE KNOW WE WANT TO GO IN A CERTAIN DIRECTION. SO, YOU KNOW, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, I DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING TO KNOW MUCH MORE BY THE TIME JUNE 1st ROLLS AROUND. IT'S SUCH A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AND I DON'T KNOW IF THAT POSTPONEMENT WILL REALLY GET US MUCH MORE THAN -- THAN WE ALREADY KNOW. AND YOU KNOW, WE WILL HAVE TO CONTICONTINUOUSLY REFINE THIS AD CHANGE IT AND IT'S UNFORTUNATE. I MEAN I DON'T -- I DON'T LIKE TO, YOU KNOW HITCH MY WAGON ON SOMETHING WHEN I DON'T KNOW AS MUCH AS I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS ONE BUT I DO KNOW THAT THE CLOCK IS TICKING. AND I KNOW THAT WE HAVE A VERY COMPETENT CITY ADMINISTRATOR CURRENTLY. AND I THINK THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE MAKING DECISIONS AS WE GO ALONG AND ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT DECISIONS WILL BE BROUGHT FORTH TO COUNCIL FOR COUNCIL APPROVAL, AND THAT'S -- THAT'S WHEN THEY GET DONE OR NOT. HERE WEHERE WE HAVE A FRAMEWORKD THERE WILL BE A DETOUR AND SOME SHORT CUTS. UNFORTUNATELY, Y I DON'T KNOW IF TEN MORE DAYS IS GOING TO MAKE US FEEL AS COMFORTABLE AS WE WANT TO BE WITH THIS DOCUMENT AND THAT'S JUST THE HONEST TRUTH. SO I APPRECIATE YOU KNOW, SOMEBODY -- LIKE MY COUNCILMEMBER SMITH WHO IS A BIG PROPONENT OFFERING TO GIVE A FEW EXTRA DAYS TO DIGEST THIS AND SOAK IT IN. BUT, YOU KNOW, I WOULD JUST WANT TO ASK THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR OR DR. STULTS WHETHER, YOU KNOW, DELAYING THIS TEN DAYS IS GOING TO HAVE A MATERIAL DIFFERENCE IN IMPLEMENTING THE PLAN.
02:19:05.513: >> NO, I MEAN DELAYING TO JUNE IS THAT WHAT YOU ARE ASKING OR LONGER?
02:19:09.850: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YEAH, JUNE 1st THAT IT'S BEING TO POSTPOPE FORWARD.
02:19:18.626: >> NO, IT'S NOT GOING TO DELAY IT. WE ARE MOVING IN ORDER IN SOME OF THE FOUNDATIONAL ACTIONS. IT WILL NOT DELAY.
02:19:25.332: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE AND DOING DOUBLE DUTY.
02:19:31.405: >> SICK KID, SORRY. ZACK ZA>> Councilmember Ackerma THANK YOU TO DR. STULTS AND THIS TEAM. I HAVEN'T FELT BULLIED INTO PASSING THIS. I DON'T KNOW WHERE OTHER COLLEAGUES SEE LINES THAT MIGHT NOT EXIST AND FELT THAT WAY. YOU KNOW WHEN YOU PUT TOGETHER A PIECE OF WORK THAT IS THIS QUALITY, AND THIS QUANTITY, IT TAKES TIME AND SOMETIMES YOU WORK TO THE DEADLINE AND REALLY APPRECIATE YOU PRODUCING SUCH HIGH QUALITY WORK ON SUCH A TIGHT TIMELINE AND THOROUGH, WELL THOUGHT OUT WORK. IT TAKES CONTINGENCIES INTO WORK AND SO REALLY, REALLY IMPRESSED AND GRATEFUL. I WON'T SUPPORT THE POSTPONEMENT, SIMPLY BECAUSE I DON'T NEED MORE TIME AS AN INDIVIDUAL BUT I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER REQUESTING THAT AND NO DISRESPECT THERE. I THINK TO COLLEAGUES -- I THINK COLLEAGUES HAVE FUNDAMENTALLY HAVE ISSUES WITH THIS PLAN IN GENERAL, I WILL JUST SAY IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY BEING REALLY DIFFICULT TO GET TO NET ZERO IN SUCH A SHORT TIME SPAN. AND IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE NOT ONLY CHANGES IN HOW WE ENGINEER OUR POWER GRID, YOU KNOW THERE'S -- WE CAN ONLY ENGINEER OUR WAY OUT TO A CERTAIN EXTENT. IT WILL ALSO MAKE CHANGES IN THE WAY WE WORK. THAT MEANS US AS CONSUMERS AND USERS OF ENERGY, WHICH HAS BEEN TALKED ABOUT AT THIS COUNCIL CHAMBER, BUT IT WILL TAKE CHANGES IN THE WAY THAT WE LIVE. AND WHAT OUR NEIGHBORHOODS LOOK LIKE AND WHAT OUR COMMUNITY LOOKS LIKE PHYSICALLY, HOW WE USE IT, WHERE WE LIVE IN RELATIONS -- IN RELATIONSHIP TO SERVICES, BE THEY GROCERY STORES, BE THEY PLACES OF WORK. AND, YOU KNOW, MAYBE OFFICE BUILDINGS ARE GOING TO CHANGE IN THE FUTURE. I THINK THAT'S WELL WITHIN, YOU KNOW, REASON. BUT IF WE WANT TO HAVE A DIVERSE COMMUNITY, IT'S NOT JUST OFFICE WORKERS WHO WILL HELP. IT WILL BE PEOPLE -- WORKING CLASS PEOPLE WHO STILL WANT TO GET TO THEIR JOB AT THE WAREHOUSE? AND THE GROCERY STORE, AND TO THEIR JOBS IN OUR PUBLIC PARKS AND TO THEIR JOB AT THE FIRE STATION. SO WE AS COMMUNITY LEADERS AS ELECTED OFFICIALS HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO ENCOURAGE CLANGS IN THE WAY THAT PEOPLE LIVE. AND SOME OF IT WILL BE DISRUPTIVE, BUT THE LARGEST GLOBAL CATASTROPHE THAT WE HAVE EVER SEEN IS LOOMING. HEADING DOWN THE PATH OF STATUS QUO IS DEADLY. SO THAT'S ALL I GOT. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE WORK.
02:22:15.736: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
02:22:16.670: >> Councilmember Bannister: THANK YOU. AND THANK YOU DR. STULTS FOR WORKING SO HARD ON THIS LAST FEW YEARS AND LEADING THE COMMUNITY THROUGH ALL OF THIS. I THINK GIVEN THAT WE JUST GOT MORE INFORMATION LAST NIGHT AND THE POSTPONEMENT TO JUNE JUNE 1st WOULD BE GOOD. AND I AM READING LOCALLY MANY OF THE EMAILS THAT -- CLOSELY MANY OF THE EMAILS THAT MANY RESIDENTS ARE TENDING TO US ABOUT THIS TOPIC AND THERE'S CONCERNS ABOUT THE SUSTAINABILITY OF BATTERIES IN THE ELECTRIC VEHICLES, THE WAY THAT THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF THEM AND I THINK ONE OF THE BIGGEST CONCERNS THAT PEOPLE ARE RAISING IS THAT THE -- POTENTIALLY CHANGING THE MODEST SINGLE FAMILY HOME TO BE A BUY RIGHT SITUATION WHERE YOU COULD HAVE TRIPLEXES AND QUADRAPLEXS ON MODEST SINGLE FAMILY HOMES, I THINK THAT ONE IS ONE THAT RESIDENTS WANTED TO TAKE A MUCH CLOSER LOOK AT AS WE HEAD TO CARBON NEUTRALITY IN 2030. SO I DO SUPPORT INCREMENTAL AND MEASURED APPROACH WITH ASSURANCES THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THIS AND -- AND WILL TAKE FURTHER CONSIDERATION WHERE MR. CRAWFORD AND WITH DR. STULTS AS WE MOVE FORWARD BUT NOR NOW,, A COUPLE TEN MORE DAYS WOULD BE USEFUL TO STUDY THE NEW INFORMATION.
02:24:01.308: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD?
02:24:03.410: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WANT THAT THANK STAFF FOR THIS REPORT AND I PROMISED A CONSTITUENT THAT I WOULD ASK THE QUESTION ABOUT EMBODIED CARBON TONIGHT, BUT IF THIS IS POSTPONED FOR TWO WEEKS, I WILL REACH OUT TO YOU LATER THIS WEEK. AND I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT YOUR REPUTATION OF BEING ABLE TO DO IT ALL IS BEING CONFIRMED BY THE PHOTO I SEE. [ CHUCKLES ]
02:24:33.240: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
02:24:34.141: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. AND APPRECIATE ANOTHER TIME TO SPEAK ON THIS. DR. STULTS, AGAIN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALL THE WORK THAT YOU HAVE PUT IN THIS. I THINK EVERYONE KEEPS SAYING THERE'S A LOT OF DETAIL IN HERE AND I LOT TO GO OVER. SO I APPRECIATE YOUR PATIENCE AND YOUR DETERMINATION ON TH THIS -- I NOTICED YOU HAD -- I'M NOT SURE IF IT WAS IN A PRIOR COMMUNICATION OR PLAN, WHERE YOU HAVE THE PLANT-RICH DIET AS AN ACTION. IS THAT SOMETHING NEW OR DID I JUST NOT SEE THAT BEFORE AND CAN YOU DESCRIBE THAT PERHAPS JUST A LITTLE BIT? I KNOW PERHAPS THIS WILL GO TO POSTPONEMENT AND THERE WILL BE MORE TIME TO TALK ABOUT IT.
02:25:12.880: >> I'M HAPPY TO TAKE THAT OFFLINE. NO, THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN IN, SINCE IT CAME FORWARD. SUPPORTING THE ROW VALUES AND BENEFITS -- ROBUST VALUES AND BENEFITS WE GET IT FROM PLANT FIRST AS OPPOSED TO PLANT-BASED. AND SO WHERE THE PLANTS TAKE UP THE LARGEST GRAINS, OATS, VEGETABLES AND FRUITS TAKE UP THE LARGEST PART OF THE PLATE. IT CAME AFTER THE COMMUNITY MEETING. IT'S ALWAYS BEEN IN THE PLAN.
02:25:45.379: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  AND COULD IT BE PUT IN ONE OF ORIGINAL SEVEN? I MEAN, SEEING THAT IT'S --
02:25:55.489: >> IT'S IN STRATEGY FIVE. IT'S AN ACTION UNDER THAT. THANK U.
02:25:58.826: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: OKAY. THANK YOU.
02:26:02.462: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER NELSON?
02:26:04.398: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I JUST HAVE A SUPER QUICK COMMENT AND IT RELATES TO A BIT OF A TANGENT WE GOT ON. I WANT TO COMMENT THAT WHEN PEOPLE TOUCH ON THIS TOPIC OF DENSITY, I -- IT PAINS ME THAT THERE AREN'T MORE OF A BR BREADH OF EXPERIENCE SITTING AT OUR TABLE BECAUSE THE DENSEST ENVIRONMENT I EVER LIVED IN FOR THREE YEARS WAS A FOOD DESERT. I LIVED IN ANOTHER ENVIRONMENT WHERE, YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY IS IN A TEENY LITTLE HOUSE WITH A TEENY LITTLE BACKYARD AND I COULD WALK EVERYWHERE. THESE SOLUTIONS ARE NOT EASY. THEY ARE NOT SIMPLE. I'M JUST A -- I -- THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY. I MEAN, IT'S JUST SORT OF ASTONISHING TO HE MANY. I REALLY HAVE -- I VERY, VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE LIFESTYLE THAT DOES NOT DEPEND ON A CAR AND I VALUE THAT. I LIVED IT. IT'S SUPER IMPORTANT AND IT'S JUST -- WE NEED TO -- WHEN WE HAVE CONVERSATIONS AROUND THIS, WE NEED TO BE SERIOUS, AND SOMETIMES I WONDER JUST HOW SERIOUS WE REALLY ARE IN THINKING THROUGH WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE. THANKS.
02:27:16.403: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE POSTPONEMENT? FOR MY PART, I'M NOT GOING TO -- I'M NOT GOING TO SUPPORT POSTPONEMENT. WE RECEIVED THE BULK OF THIS DOCUMENT ABOUT TWO MONTHS AGO, BACK IN MARCH. WE HAD A -- AN IN-DEPTH DISCUSSION OF THAT, YOU KNOW, A FEW WEEKS LATER, AFTER THAT. THEN COUNCIL ASKED FOR A FINANCE PLAN AND A PRIORITIZATION PLAN AND WE HAD A PRESENTATION OF THAT TODAY. IN MY VIEW, THE DRIVE FOR CERTAINTY, THE DRIVE TO HAVE ALL THE QUESTIONS ANSWERED IS IMPRACTICAL. THAT'S SIMPLY NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. THIS IS A DOCUMENT THAT'S BEING CREATED OPE ON THE RUN AND THATS BECAUSE OF THE URGENCY OF THE PROBLEM AND THE SCOPE OF THE SOLUTION. WE NEED TO MOVE THIS FORWARD. WE CANNOT DITHER. WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO EMPOWER STAFF, TO EMBOLDEN STAFF, TO EMPOWER THE COMMUNITY AND EMBOLDEN THE COMMUNITY IN A -- A -- IN A MULTIPRONGED CREATIVE APPROACH. AND BY POSTPONING IT YET AGAIN, YOU KNOW, WE ARE, I THINK UNDERCUTTING THAT. I WILL SAY ALSO THAT THE -- THAT LAND USE OBVIOUSLY IS SOMETHING THAT THE COMMUNITY IS CONCERNED WITH, UP AND DOWN THE LINE. THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH LAND USE. THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF -- THE SUGGESTION THAT THE INTRO LETTER IS MISLEADING. THE FACT THAT LAND USE SHOWS UP HENNIEST PARAGRAPH AND THAT'S SOMEHOW A TRANSGRESSION IS ONE OF THE SILLIER THINGS I HEARD. IF IT WAS BURIED FIFTH PARAGRAPH THEN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HIDDEN IN THE FIFTH PARAGRAPH RATHER THAN SOME TYPE OF ASYMMETRIC PRIORIZATION. YOU KNOW, THE FACT IS THAT WE HAVE TO USE -- EVERY TOOL IN OUR DISPOSAL TO -- TO ACHIEVE A CARBON NEUTRALITY GOAL. AND QUESTION HAVE TO USE EVERY MEANS POSSIBLE AND WE CANNOT DO THAT UNLESS WE MOVE BOLDLY AND SWIFTLY AND MOVE IN AN ENVIRONMENT OF GUIDED UNCERTAINTY AND THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE HERE. WE HAVE A PLAN THAT IS -- YOU KNOW, I WOULD STACK UP OUR PLAN AGAINST ANYONE'S. THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY DETAILED DOCUMENT. IT'S INCREDIBLY SOPHISTICATED DOCUMENT, A LEARNED DOCUMENT THAT'S FORWARD THINKING AND WE SHOULD SAY THANK YOU AND I DO SAY THANK YOU AND WE SHOULD GO FORWARD WITH GREAT G GUNS AND I WILL NOT SUPPORT POSTPONEMENT. FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER. CLERK STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?

IT IS ESSENTIALLY FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES, IT'S THE SAME HEIGHT THAT THE COUNCIL PREVIOUSLY SAW AN THERE ARE PLENTY OF LETTERS IN SUPPORT OF THE PROJECT IN THE PROJECT FILE AND WE ARE HERE IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS.

02:45:32.832: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER 701, THE LAST THREE DIGITS OR 701.
02:45:37.470: >> YES.
02:45:37.970: >> Mayor Taylor: PLEASE PROCEED.
02:45:39.572: >> HI.
02:45:39.805: >> Mayor Taylor: I HAD THERE, YOU ARE ON.
02:45:42.908: >> OKAY. THANK YOU. MY NAME IS CHA FU MA. WE HAVE 345 FEET OF FRONTAGE AND ARE CURRENTLY SLATED FOR A $61,975 ASSESSMENT FOR THE PROPOSED SIDEWALK PROJECT. I'M ALSO SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE CHEN, CAMERON AND GARY PROPERTIES. WHILE THERE ARE MANY ISSUES TO BE DISCUSSED, I WOULD LIKE TO FOCUS ON THE TOPIC OF BENEFIT THIS APPEARS TO BE AROUND PARENT PART OF THE BENEFIT TO PLACE THE ENTIRE FINANCIAL BURDEN OF THE PROJECT ON FIVE PROPERTY MANAGERS. IN APRIL ATTEMPT TO UNDERSTAND THE GENESIS OF THIS PROJECT, I RELIED HEAVENLY ON THE POWERPOINT PRESENTATION AND FROM IT I GLEANED THIS IS A CITY INITIATIVE INTENDED TO IMPROVE PEDESTRIAN SAFETY ALONG JACKSON ROAD AND TO ENHANCE THE TRANSPORTATION AND RECREATIONAL EXPERIENCE FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC. AS SUCH, THE PROPERTY PROJECT IS USING CITY ORDINANCE CHAPTER 12 AND 13 AND SIDEWALK ORDINANCE 4.56 FOR THE AUTHORITY TO DEFRAY THE COMPLETE COST OF THE PROJECT ON DENIED PROPERTY OWNERS. AS PER CHAPTER 13, SECTION 1.202, THE COUNCIL SHALL HAVE THE POWER THAT THE WHOLE OR ANY PART OF THE COST OF IMPROVEMENT SHALL BE DEFRAYED BY SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS ON PROPERTY ESPECIALLY BENEFITED, UNQUOTE. USE OF THIS ORDINANCE ASSUMES AT THAT TIME PROPERTY OWNERS ARE BENEFITING FROM THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE SIDEWALK. I WOULD ARGUE THAT THIS IS A FALSE PREMISE. HOWEVER, FOR RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES, IT IS LESS CLEAR. THE PROPERTY OWNERS REQUEST A SIDEWALK AND THEN THERE'S A PERCEIVED BENEFIT TO THE OWNERS IN. THIS CASE, THIS REQUEST WAS NOT MADE. AT LEAST FOUR OR FIVE OWNERS OBJECT TO THE PROJECT. IN THE CASE OF MY FAMILY'S PROPERTY AS AN UNDEVELOPED LOT, THE PROPOSED $51,971 ASSESSMENT REPRESENTS APPROXIMATELY 25% OF THE ASSESSED PROPERTY VALUE. IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE HOW THAT ADDS COMMENSURATE INCREASE TO THE PROPERTY VALUE. NOT ONLY THAT, A CONCRETE SIDEWALK GOES WITH THE ONGOING LIABILITY INSURANCE AND THE LOGISTICS OF SNOW REMOVAL AND SIDEWALK MAINTENANCE. ACCORDING TO 4.6, ANY ACCUMULATION OF ONE INCH OF SNOW OR MORE REQUIRES REMOVAL WITHIN 24 HOURS. THIS IS LOT IS UNINHABITED MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO ACCOMMODATE THIS MANDATE.
02:48:10.122: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
02:48:11.457: >> IN THE OTHER PROPERTIES, THE RESPECTIVE 22,015,000, 8,000 PROPOSED ASSESSMENTS SORE ONEROUS TO THEM THAT THEY ARE ACTUALLY FEARFUL OF LOSING THEIR HOMES. I FAIL TO SEE HOW THIS CAN BE CONSTRUED AS A BENEFIT TO THEM. THE EXTRA WIDE 5-FOOT SIDEWALK IS INAPPROPRIATE IN FRONT OF A RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY. IF THIS CITY OWNED SIDEWALK IS BEING BUILT FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC FOR PEDESTRIAN SAFETY AND CONVENIENCE, THEN THE BURDEN OF THE COST OF THE PROJECT SHOULD FALL ON THE SHOULDERS OF CITY GOVERNMENT. THE CITY DOES NOT CURRENTLY HAVE ADEQUATE FUNDS TO CONSTRUCT A SIDEWALK ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN, THEN --
02:48:49.094: >> Clerk Beaudry: TIME.
02:48:49.795: >> THANK YOU.
02:48:50.162: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE -- IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING? PLEASE PRESS STAR NINE.
02:49:01.574: >> Councilmember Bannister: MAYOR TAYLOR, A RESIDENT TRYING TO CALL IN --
02:49:05.711: >> Clerk Beaudry: I HAVE SEVERAL ON THE LINE. CALLER 034.
02:49:11.984: >> HI, THIS IS MELANIE CAMERON AND I'M ON JACKSON ROAD 3415 JACKSON AVENUE. WE WERE NOTIFIED ON THURSDAY REGARDING THIS PLAN FOR THE SIDEWALK TO BE DONE AND THE ASSESSMENT OF OUR PROPERTY TO BE PROPOSED OF $15,259.31 FOR THE SIDEWALK PLAN. THERE'S AN ISSUE WITH THAT, FOR ONE THING WE WERE NEVER NOTIFIED AND THIS WAS THE FINAL HEARING. THE ADDRESS THAT WAS ADDRESSED TO US WAS THROUGH THE HABITAT FOR HUMANITY OFFICE WHICH IS NO LONG ON APRIL DRIVE. IT'S ACTUALLY -- IT HAS MOVED SINCE THEN. WE WERE NOT NOTIFIED OF ANYTHING ELSE BESIDES NEIGHBORHOOD -- OUR NEIGHBOR'S COMING IN AND INFORMING US OF THIS HEARING TODAY. WE DO NOT FEEL THAT THE SIDEWALK IS BENEFICIAL TO US. AS HOMEOWNERS, AS IT WOULD BE TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC, WALKING FROM THE BUS AREA, AATA STOP THROUGH JACKSON ROAD WHICH THEY DO QUITE OFTEN ON OUR PROPERTY. SO IT'S MORE BENEFICIAL TO THE CITY RATHER THAN TO OUR OWN PROPERTY. WE CERTAINLY PAY OUR SHARE OF TAXES AND SO IT IS NOT EXCLUSIVELY OUR RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE PROPERTY OWNERS WHO ARE BEING CITED WITH THIS PROPOSED AMOUNT TO BE ASSESSED TO OUR PROPERTY VALUE. RIGHT NOW, THIS IS A VERY HARD TIME WITH COVID-19 GOING ON, AND FINANCIAL STATUS IS VERY UNCERTAIN AT THE TIME. I AM A NURSE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AND SO LET'S -- I'M SURE YOU HAVE HEARD OF THE UPCOMING 1400 FTEs THAT HAVE TO BE LET GO. MY HUSBAND IS A BUS DRIVER AT THE ANN ARBOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND AT THIS TIME, THEY UNCERTAIN OF THEIR FUTURE IN THE FALL. AND RIGHT NOW THEY ARE NOT WORKING. AND THE GARYS NEXT DOOR TO US, WE WORKS FOUR JOBS TO KEEP HIS HOUSEHOLD GOING. SO IT IS VERY UNCERTAIN AND UNCERTAIN OF WHY AND HOW THIS ASSESSMENT WOULD BE POSSIBLE FOR OUR FAMILIES.
02:51:42.935: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS. EVERYTHING.
02:51:44.937: >> THAT YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND LISTENING AND CONSIDERING OUR OBJECTION TO THIS PROPOSAL FOR THE SIDEWALK GAP. THANK YOU. TAME THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING?
02:52:00.352: >> Clerk Beaudry: YES, MAYOR.
02:52:07.226: >> Mayor Taylor: PLEASE PRESS STAR NINE TO BE RECOGNIZED.
02:52:09.795: >> Clerk Beaudry: 328. THE LAST THREE DIGITS ARE 328. GO AHEAD AND SPEAK.
02:52:16.602: >> YEAH. 2328?
02:52:20.305: >> Clerk Beaudry: YES.
02:52:20.806: >> Mayor Taylor: YES, SIR, YOU ARE ON.
02:52:22.941: >> MY NAME IS JERRY SHOBONO, AND AN ANN ARBOR IS WARD TWO AND I'M CALLING TO ENCOURAGE AND URGE YOU GUYS TO HONOR THE CITY'S 2017 COMMITMENT TO USE THE REBATED PORTION OF THE MILLAGE FOR UNDERFUNDED CITY PRIORITIES INCLUDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING.
02:52:47.666: >> Mayor Taylor: SIR, SIR, MY APOLOGIES. YOU CALLED INTO A PUBLIC HEARING AT THE CITY COUNCIL. THE PUBLIC HEARING HAS RULES AND IT'S -- THE SPEECH AT A PUBLIC HEARING MUST RELATE TO THE SPECIFIC SUBJECT MATTER OF THE PUBLIC HEARING. THIS IS A PUBLIC HEARING RELATED TO A PROPOSED SIDEWALK GAP PROJECT ON JACKSON AVENUE.
02:53:08.654: >> OH, I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT. I'M SORRY.
02:53:11.190: >> Mayor Taylor: NO WORRIES. HAVE A GOOD NIGHT, SIR.
02:53:13.892: >> YEAH, BYE.
02:53:15.027: >> Mayor Taylor: IF YOU WISH TO POSE A PUBLIC COMMENT GENERAL TIME, IT WILL BE AVAILABLE AT THE END OF THE MEETING. A TIME UNCERTAIN I'M AFRAID. IS THIS ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING?
02:53:34.146: >> Clerk Beaudry: A CALLER NUMBER 423. LAST THREE DIGITS ARE 423. YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND SPEAK.
02:53:41.653: >> YES, MY NAME IS GARY, AND I'M HERE FOR THE SIDEWALK IN MY AREA. AND I TOTALLY AGREE ABOUT THE COST AND WE NEED TO REVISIT THIS ISSUE. AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I TOTALLY AGREE WHAT MY TWO OTHER NEIGHBORS SAID BEFORE. THANK YOU, MAYOR TAYLOR AND OUR COUNCILMEMBERS. THANK YOU.
02:54:13.952: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING?
02:54:27.065: >> Clerk Beaudry: THERE'S ONE MORE CALLER BUT -- OH, HE DOES HAVE HIS HAND UP.
02:54:31.603: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. CLERK CALLER 985. 985. YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND SPEAK.
02:54:39.578: >> OKAY. HI. MY NAME IS JULIE BEAN AND I'M CALLING TO VOICE MY OBJECTION TO THE SIDEWALK GAP PROJECT, BECAUSE THIS PROJECT WILL IMPOSE THE BURDEN ON THE FAMILIES ON JACKSON ROAD AND NOT ONLY ON JACKSON ROAD, BUT ALSO ONYXON ROAD AND TRAVER ROAD AND ESPECIALLY WHEN IMMIGRANT FAMILIES ARE NOT ONLY PHYSICALLY BUT ALSO EMOTIONALLY AND FINANCIALLY SUFFERING THE UNPRECEDENTED EPIDEMIC. IT'S VERY WRONG FOR THE CITY TO FINANCIALLY BULLY SMALL GROUPS OF ITS CITIZENS. AND TO AVOID ITS LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY TO SERVE ALL THE CITIZENS EQUALLY. THE I WAY CITY COUNCIL TREATS THIS HEARING THIS PROJECT OR TODAY, MAY HAPPEN TO OTHER CITIZENS IN THE FUTURE. I THINK AS A CITIZEN, WE HAVE TO BAND TOGETHER OBJECT ANY PROJECT REGARDING THIS SIDEWALK PROJECT. THANK YOU.
02:56:20.712: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
02:56:25.250: >> Clerk Beaudry: MAYOR, THAT'S ALL THE CALLERS ON THE LINE.
02:56:27.953: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING? SEE NO ONE, THIS PUBLIC HEARING IS CLOSED. HEARING NO ONE, THIS PUBLIC HEARING IS CLOSED. A-1:00 THE REGULAR SESSION MEETING MINUTES OF MAY 4, 2020. MAY I HAVE A MOTION TO APPROVE THESE MEETINGS. MOVED BY SMITH AND SECONDED BY RAMLAWI. DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] ALL OPPOSED? MINUTES ARE APPROVED. B-1. AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND CHAPTER 55 (ZONING), REZONING OF 0.20 ACRE FROM C1B (COMMUNITY CONVENIENCE CENTER DISTRICT) TO PUD (PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT), THE GARNET PUD ZONING AND SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS, 325 EAST SUMMIT STREET. MOVED BY COUNCIL MEMBER ACKERMAN, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER EATON. DISCUSSION OF B-1 COUNCILMEMBER EATON?
02:57:27.612: >> Councilmember Eaton: I SENT A AMENDMENT AND IF SHE WOULD CIRCULATE IT, I WOULD APPRECIATE IT. THE COUNCIL DENIED A PETITION FOR THIS PROPERTY WHEN IT WAS BEING PROPOSED AS C1-A ZONING DISTRICT. AND NOTIFIED THE DEVELOPER THAT THEY COULD RESUBMIT THIS SAME DEVELOPMENT AS A PUD. AT THAT TIME, THE CITY WAS IN THE PROCESS OF MODIFYING ITS ORDINANCE REQUIREMENT FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THE NEW AFFORDABLE HOUSING ORDINANCE HAD AN EXCEPTION FOR A PENDING PROJECT. AND AT THE TH TIME THEY HAD A SE PLAN APPLICATION PENDING. GIVE THAN THEY HAD THE PENDING PETITION, AND IT WAS IN THE PIPELINE AT THE TIME OF THE ORDINANCE CHANGE. GIVEN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES I'M GOING TO PROPOSE THAT WE AMENDMENT BOTH THE SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS AND THE DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT FOR THE GARNET TO INCLUDE THE CALCULATION OF $88,200 FOR THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR THIS DEVELOPMENT. SO WITH REGARD TO B1, I MOVE THAT SECTION 4J OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS BE CHANGED TO READ AS FOLLOWS:  IN LIEU OF PROVIDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING ON THE SITE FOR HOUSEHOLDS AT OR BELOW 60% OF AMI, $88,200 SHALL BE PROVIDED TO THE CITY FOR THE ANN ARBOR HOUSING FUND.
02:59:07.179: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THAT A SECOND? THAT'S SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM. IS THAT BEING DISTRIBUTED?
02:59:22.460: >> Clerk Beaudry: COUNCILMEMBER EATON, I DON'T HAVE THAT.
02:59:24.362: >> Councilmember Eaton: I'M SORRY. LET ME TRY AGAIN. I APOLOGIZE. DID THAT COME THROUGH?
03:00:40.305: >> Councilmember Bannister: NOT YET.
03:00:45.443: >> Clerk Beaudry: NOPE YORK SEET SEE IT YET.
03:00:50.215: >> Councilmember Bannister: WELL --
03:01:31.089: >> Clerk Beaudry: I HAVE IT NOW.
03:01:32.691: >> Councilmember Eaton: MY APOLOGIES. I DON'T  HAVE ANYTHING MORE TO SAY ABOUT IT. BUT I WOULD ENTERTAIN QUESTIONS IF ANYBODY HAS --
03:01:49.341: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
03:01:52.077: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I MEAN, I JUST HAVE A QUESTION BECAUSE I HAVE SEEN A LOT OF COMMUNICATION BACK AND FORTH REGARDING THIS CONTRIBUTION OF THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING TRUST FUND AND, YOU KNOW, WE ARE ALWAYS -- WHY WOULD WE -- I UNDERSTAND THE $88,000 FIGURE WAS USED INITIALLY -- I'M HAVING TROUBLE GOING FROM 300 SOME THOUSAND TO 88. THIS SEEMS LIKE IT SHOULD BE MORE -- THE NUMBERS SHOULD BE MANY SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE PERHAPS. I DON'T KNOW. IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT THAT WE ARE GOING TO TAKE NEARLY A QUARTER MILLION DOLLARS AWAY, PERHAPS FROM THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING TRUST FUND WHEN WE DON'T NEED TO.
03:02:55.507: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? I HAVE COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
03:02:58.510: >> Councilmember Ackerman: I'M SORRY. I RAISED MY VIRTUAL HAND. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, I DO APPRECIATE THAT POINT, AND IT HURTS. I THINK THE REALITY IS THAT IF WE DON'T LOWER THIS NUMBER, THE PROJECT WON'T BE BUILT AND IT WILL BE ZERO DOLLARS IN THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECT. AND THAT'S A -- YOU KNOW, THAT'S AN UNFORTUNATE TRADEOFF BUT I SEE THIS AS TAKING, YOU KNOW, NEARLY THE 90,000 AS, YOU KNOW, CASH AS OPPOSED TO LIKE THE QUARTER MILLION ON PAPER. AND THAT IS A TRADEOFF I'M COMFORTABLE MAKING. YOU KNOW, I DO THINK THAT WE HAVE PUT THIS DEVELOPER IN AN UNFORTUNATE POSITION. I THINK WE HAVE MOVED FORWARD WITH THIS A LOT SOONER, AND WE HAVE MADE THEM JUMP THROUGH A LOT OF HOOPS THAT THEY HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLY PATIENT TO DEAL WITH AT A TIME WITH LOCAL BUSINESSES ARE STRUGGLING AND THE REAL ESTATE MARKET IS UP CERTAIN. THIS IS A BLOW TO THOSE TRYING TO BUILD IN RESPECTFUL, HISTORIC CHARACTER IN A SMALL SCALE, WHILE STILL INCREASING THE DENSITY, YOU KNOW, PROXIMATE TO OUR TWO LARGEST EMPLOYERS, THE HEALTH SYSTEM AND THE UNIVERSITY. SO, YOU KNOW YORK, I DON'T LIKEW THE SAUSAGE GOT MADE BUT I WILL EAT IT.
03:04:27.232: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
03:04:28.333: >> Councilmember Lumm: WAS THAT A FRIENDLY AMENDMENT OR ARE WE TO VOTE ON THE AMENDMENT?
03:04:32.737: >> Mayor Taylor: WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE AMENDMENT.
03:04:34.339: >> Councilmember Lumm: RIGHT. SO IT WILL BE A ROLL CALL VOTE OR --
03:04:37.675: >> Mayor Taylor: AT THIS POINT, THERE'S BEEN ENOUGH QUESTIONS ABOUT IT, I WILL PROBABLY ASK FOR A ROLL CALL VOTE.
03:04:43.548: >> Councilmember Lumm: OKAY. I WOULD JUST SAY THAT -- SO THE DEVELOPER HERE IS A SMALL LOCAL DEVELOPER, AND THE PAYMENT AT 88,000, NOT 317 IS THE PAYMENT WOULD HAVE BEEN REQUIRED UNDER THE RULES WHEN THE GARNET PROJECT WAS ORIGINALLY SUBMITTED AND THERE'S BEEN LOTS OF BACK AND FORTH ABOUT THE TIMING ON THAT. BUT MY TAKE IS THAT -- THAT THE -- WHEN THE PETITIONER WAS INFORMED ABOUT THE $317,000 REQUIREMENT AND THAT WAS ON FEBRUARY 6th, THAT WAS THREE MONTHS AFTER THE PUD ZONING APPLICATION WAS SUBMITTED, AND THE -- SO THE PETITIONER WAS OPERATING UNDER THE ASSUMPTION THAT IT WAS 88,000. THE -- WE DISCUSSED THIS A LOT AT THE APRIL 6th COUNCIL MEETING. AND THE 88,000 AT THAT MEETING WAS MENTIONED AND DISCUSSED A LOT, AND NO ONE DID CHOO I AM IN TO CORRECT US. I THINK THE DEVELOPER MET THE OLD RULES, AND THE TIMING AND THE REASON THIS CAME BACK, OF COURSE IS BECAUSE IT CAME BACK AT COUNCIL'S DIRECTION. THERE WAS NO CHANGE MADE ON THE PART OF THE PETITIONER. AND SO FOR ME, IT'S A MATTER OF FAIRNESS, AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS PROJECT GO TO. FORWARD. I I I WILL SPEAK TO THAT BRIEFLY MOMENTARILY.
03:06:35.059: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER SMITH?
03:06:45.637: >> Councilmember Smith: AS LONG AS WE HAVE MS. THATCHER HERE, WHETHER THE COUNCIL WITH RAISE CERTAIN FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS AS PART OF THIS PROCESS.
03:07:06.958: >> IF I COULD ADDRESS THAT, COUNCILMEMBER SMITH. BRENT LENART THE PLANNING MANAGER.
03:07:17.235: >> Councilmember Smith: SORRY, YOU WERE HIDDEN ON MY SCREEN.
03:07:19.170: >> I THINK PREVIOUSLY THE PLANNING STAFF HAS PROVIDED OUR VIEW AND CALCULATIONS AND ULTIMATELY, IT'S UP TO ULTIMATELY MAKE THE INTERPRETATION OF THE APPLICATION OF THE ORDINANCE. SO I -- I FEEL LIKE WE HAVE ADDRESSED THAT QUESTION IN THE PAST.
03:07:39.657: >> Councilmember Smith: THANK YOU.
03:07:50.735: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
03:07:51.602: >> Councilmember Hayner:  WE ARE SPEAKING TO THIS AMENDMENT. I GUESS I WILL SUPPORT THIS AMENDMENT. WE HAVE HAD A STRANGE -- WE SORT OF A -- I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S TWO STEP OR WHAT WITH THIS PROJECT, BUT IT'S BEEN SORT OF A STRANGE DANCE WITH THIS, THE C1A ZONING THAT WAS ASKED FOR ON THIS SITE. IT WAS ALL RESIDENTIAL IN A CAMPUS AREA BUSINESS MIX ZONING. IT DOESN'T SEEM APPROPRIATE. WE ASKED THEM TO COME BACK WITH SOMETHING ELSE AND THAT SOMETHING ELSE HAD SOME HEFTY REQUIREMENTS. I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN REJECTED OUTRIGHT. THE FACT THAT I KNOW THAT COUNCILWOMAN BANNISTER AND OTHERS WORKED DILIGENTLY WITH THIS DEVELOPER AND ARCHITECT AND STAFF TO REACH THIS COMPROMISE, THAT IT IS A COMPROMISE AND I HAD PEOPLE TELL ME THAT A COMPROMISE IS WHEN NOBODY IS HAPPY. I'M NOT SURE IF THAT'S ACCURATE, BUT IT MIGHT BE IN THIS CASE. YOU THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE IN THIS SITUATION, AS LONG AS IT DOESN'T SET UP ANY KIND OF AN UNDUE EXPECTATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT. WE HAVE CLOSED THE DOOR ON CERTAIN ACTIVITIES, AND WE HAVE DATES AND RULES FOR EVERYTHING COMING FORWARD AND I THINK THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE -- AN APPROPRIATE COMPROMISE IN THIS SITUATION, AND I APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT WAS DONE TO BRING IT TO THIS.
03:09:21.058: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
03:09:22.960: >> Councilmember Eaton: THANK YOU. I WANT TO MAKE CLEAR THAT THIS IS NOT REALLY A COMPROMISE. WE DIDN'T PICK A NUMBER OUT OF THE MIDDLE BETWEEN ZERO AND $317,000. BUT THIS IS THEALCULATION THAT THE DEVELOPER PRESENTED TO US, SHOWED THEIR MAP, AND I BELIEVE THAT THEIR NUMBERS ARE VALID AND WORTHWHILE, BUT ALSO IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR COMPROMISE, YOU, I SUPPOSE, WOULD ACCEPT THIS AS A COMPROMISE BECAUSE IF WE IMPOSE THE $317,000 AMOUNT, THIS PROJECT WON'T BE BUILT. SO WE WILL RECEIVE NO MONEY FOR THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUND AND -- BUT I HAD SEEN THE MATH. I BELIEVE THAT THE DEVELOPER DID IT CORRECTLY. THIS WON'T APPLY TO ANYBODY ELSE BECAUSE THIS IS OUR OLD FORMULA. AND MOVING FORWARD, WE'LL USE THE NEW FORMULA FOR OTHER PUDs AND I'M SATISFIED THAT THIS IS THE CORRECT NUMBER, NOT SOME -- PULLING THE NUMBER OUT OF OUR POCKETS SORT OF THING.
03:10:28.125: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
03:10:29.527: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I WOULD LIKE TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES FOR EXPLAINING THEIR RATIONALE. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE PUBLIC TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS GOING ON HERE. I KNOW THIS IS A LOADED QUESTION, MR. MOORE, IF HE'S AVAILABLE TO ANSWER THIS, IF -- YOU KNOW, I DO -- I WOULD LIKE TO, IF THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY.
03:10:58.055: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. MOORE, ARE YOU AVAILABLE?
03:10:59.957: >> Clerk Beaudry: I CAN MOVE MR. MOORE OVER.
03:11:01.692: >> I'M HERE.
03:11:02.159: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: GOOD EVENING, MR. MOORE. THANK YOU. I JUST HAVE A QUICK QUESTION. WITH THIS PROJECT IN THE RECALCULATIONS OF $330,000 OR SO, WOULD THAT PRETTY MUCH HARPOON THIS PROJECT? WOULD IT PRETTY MUCH KILL IT?
03:11:23.080: >> ABSOLUTELY.
03:11:24.282: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: OKAY. WELL, THANKS FOR BEING HERE AND ANSWERING THAT QUESTION. I KNOW IT'S SOMEWHAT LOADED BUT I NEEDED TO ASK IT ANYWAYS. THANK YOU.
03:11:35.393: >> UNDERSTOOD.
03:11:36.694: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE AMENDMENT? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? AMENDMENT PASSES. FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN MOTION AS AMENDED? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
03:11:59.417: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES, THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. SPEAKING OF THIS REZONING AGAIN, CA1 HAS HAD SOME TERRIBLE RESULTS WHEN IT HASN'T BEEN FULLY APPLIED AND IT'S A LITTLE ODD THAT WE ASK THE DEVELOPER TO GO AWAY AND COME BACK WITH SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES IDENTICAL. I THINK HE SUGGESTED THAT SOME SMALL IMPROVEMENTS WERE MADE AND THAT'S APPRECIATED AND THE ONE IMPROVE IS WE ARE SLIPPING SOME MONEY OVER TO THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUND AND THAT'S IMPORTANT. I -- YOU KNOW WHEN THIS CAME BEFORE US LAST TIME, I -- AND I AGREE WITH THIS. I -- THIS ISN'T THE KIND OF BUILDINGS THAT OUR CLIMATE ACTION PLAN WANTS US TO BUILD. WE WANT ELECTRIFIED BUILDINGS AND MISSED USE IN MASTER PLANS FOR MIXED USE AND MASTER PLAN FOR POTENTIAL TRANSIT CORRIDOR AREAS AND IT GETS -- IT DOESN'T GET MUCH MORE TRANSIT THAN A FOUR-STORY VIEW OF THE TRAIN STATIONS AND THE BUS DEPOT AND SO ON. AND SO, YOU KNOW, I'M -- I'M NOT HAPPY THAT IT'S -- I MEAN, YOU KNOW, PERSONALLY, I'M NOT THRILLED WITH THE USE ON THIS SITE, BASED ON THAT MASTER PLAN, BUT I -- I VIEW THIS EVEN MORE THAN THE PREVIOUS AMENDMENT AS A COMPROMISE THAT IS -- YOU KNOW, GOING TO HAVE THE VALUE OF GET SOMETHING AFFORDABLE HOUSING MONEY FOR US. YOU KNOW, I'M NOT -- AGAIN, I'M NOT A FAN OF THE BUILDING. I DON'T THINK IT'S THE KIND OF BUILDINGS WE SHOULD BE BUILDING ANYMORE, BUT BARRING A RESOLUTION, I WILL GO WITH MY COUNCIL COLLEAGUE, COUNCILWOMAN BANNISTER AND SAY THAT, YOU KNOW, I WILL RELUCTANTLY SUPPORT THIS PROJECT, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE IT DOES AWH AWAY WITH C1A ZONINN THAT LOCATION.
03:14:05.910: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
03:14:07.645: >> Councilmember Lumm: I WILL BE BRIEF AND SPEAK TO THE ZONING AND THE SITE PLAN. I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT BOTH AND I'M PLEASED WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO WORK THIS THROUGH. IN MY VIEW, THE PUD ZONING IS MUCH MORE APPROPRIATE THAN CAMPUS BUSINESS DISTRICT, WHICH THIS IS NOT. AND THE PUD HAS GENERATED AFFORDABLE HOUSING CONTRIBUTION THAT OTHERWISE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A REQUIREMENT. IN TERMS OF THE PROJECT ITSELF, THERE'S BEEN GENERAL SUPPORT FOR THE PROJECT ITSELF, INCLUDING THE OLD FOURTH WARD ASSOCIATION, AND THERE CLEARLY ARE BENEFITS. THERE'S AN ADDITIONAL HOUSING, AESTHETICS, ON-SORT PARKING AND STORMWATER MANAGEMENT AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING CONTRIBUTION. AND IMPORTANTLY, THERE WILL BE A SITE CLEAN UP THAT THE DEVELOPER IS PAYING FOR WITHOUT ANY BROWNFIELD PUBLIC ASSISTANCE. THE PLANNING COMMISSION SUPPORTED THE ZONING AND THE SITE PLAN UNANIMOUSLY. I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT AS WALL. AS WELL.THANK YOU.
03:15:10.107: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER SMITH?
03:15:12.643: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YOU'RE ON MUTE.
03:15:18.082: >> Mayor Taylor: YOU'RE ON MUTE. COUNCILMEMBER SMITH, YOU ARE ON MUTE.
03:15:21.719: >> Councilmember Smith: PROBABLY FOR THE BETTER. I AGREE THAT EVERYTHING THAT COUNCILMEMBER LUMM SAID ABOUT WHY THIS IS A GOOD PROJECT AND WHY WE SHOULD SUPPORT IT, I'M VERY TROUBLED AT HOW WE HAVE GOTTEN TO THIS POINT. I THOUGHT THAT THE PRIOR REZONING REQUEST WAS THE APPROPRIATE WAY TO PROCEED. IT DOESN'T AND HOW WE HAVE GOTTEN HERE GIVES ME A LOT OF HEARTBURN. AT THE END OF THE DAY, IT'S A GOOD PROJECT TO MOVE FORWARD WITH, FOR ALL THE REASONS THAT MY COLLEAGUE JUST WENT THROUGH. THANKS.
03:16:04.094: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
03:16:06.063: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. I WANTED TO THANK THE PETITIONERS AND MR. MOORE AND EVERYBODY, STAFF, THAT'S REALLY JUST KEEP HAMMERING AWAY AT THIS TO GET THE BEST POSSIBLE RESULTS FOR THE COMMUNITY FOR THE PETITIONER. SO I KNOW IT'S -- IT GIVES US HEARTBURN AND WE SUPPORTED IT ORIGINALLY UNDER DIFFERENT SUBMITTAL, BUT IT IS WHAT IT IS, AND IN THE END, WE HOPE THAT IT CAN BE CONSTRUCTED AND IT WITH BE CLE CLEANED ADDITIONAL HOUSI. THANKS EVERYONE FOR THEIR PERSISTENCE IN SEEING THIS THING THROUGH. IT'S REALLY BEEN A LOT OF WORK TO SEE THIS THROUGH. THANK YOU.
03:16:59.250: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? I GUESS I WILL SAY THAT I'M GLAD THAT THIS  IS MOVING FORWARD, BT I WOULD LIKE TO ECHO THE CONCERNS OF HOW WE GOT HERE. WE ASKED THE DEVELOPER TO INCUR THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS OF COST THAT WERE UNNECESSARY FOR AN END RESULT, WHICH IS IS FUNCTIONALLY THE SAME PROJECT. IT'S NOT A -- I DON'T THINK IT REFLECTS WELL UPON THE WAY WE DO BUSINESS HERE AT THE TABLE. TARFURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? I'M SORRY, COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER, YOU ARE RAISING YOUR HAND? I CAN SEE YOU MUCH -- I'M MORE LIKELY TO SEE YOU IF YOU ARE RAISING YOUR HAND ELECTRONICALLY BECAUSE IT SHOWS UP BLUE ON THE SCREEN OVER HERE. COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
03:17:51.135: >> Councilmember Bannister: WELL, I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT WE SWITCHED FROM THE C1A ZONING TO THE PUD BECAUSE C1A DOES NOT REQUIRE SETBACKS OR HEIGHT LIMITS. AND SO THAT WAS THE ARGUMENT THIS THAT WE DON'T WANT C1A SPREADING OUT INTO THE NEIGHBORHOODS AND POSSIBLY IMPACTING OTHER HOMES AND RESIDENCES. SO I'M GLAD THAT I'M -- I'M SORRY THAT WE HAD TO GO THROUGH ALL OF THIS EXTRA HOOPS AND DELAYS, BUT I THINK WE HAVE COME OUT IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION IN THE END, THAT WE HAVE PROTECTED OUR RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS FROM AN UNLIMITED HEIGHT, NO SETBACK ZONING CATEGORY.
03:18:46.323: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
03:18:47.257: >> Councilmember Ackerman: JUST TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT ON A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT WERE JUST MENTIONED. ALL REZONINGS ARE ZONE AT THE DISCRETION OF CITY COUNCIL. SO IF WE HAD REZONED ONE SITE, C1A, WE WOULD HAVE HAD COMPLETE DISCRETION TO DO SO OR NOT TO DO SO ON ANY SUBSEQUENT SITES. ADDITIONALLY, THE SITE PLAN WAS CONDITIONAL TO THE REZONING. THERE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN A FEAR OF SOMETHING BEING SWITCHED AROUND IN SOME 16-STORY BUILDING BEING BUILT ON THIS SITE. WE WOULD HAVE GOTTEN WHAT WE WOULD HAVE GOT.
03:19:25.295: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
03:19:27.931: >> Councilmember Grand: HAVE MUCH MORE THAN WHAT MY THIRD WARD COLLEAGUE HAD TO SAY. I WANT TO SAY, THIS IS -- THERE'S NOTHING GOOD ABOUT GETTING TO THE SAME RESULT BECAUSE WE HAVE TO SOMETIMES LOOK OURSELVES IN THE FACE AND WHEN WE THINK ABOUT WHY HOUSING IS SO EXPENSIVE HERE, AND WHY WE HAVE THE REPUTATION FOR BEING DIFFICULT TO BUILD SIMPLE PROJECTS THAT EVEN NEIGHBORS WANT TO SEE CALL THIS EXHIBIT A. AND I'M SORRY TO THE PETITIONER FOR TAKING SO LONG TO GET HERE.
03:20:07.538: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. COUNCILMEMBER EATON?
03:20:11.842: >> Councilmember Eaton: THANK YOU. I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE THE POINT THAT WE'RE TRYING TO SEND A CLEAR MESSAGE THAT CAMPUS AREA ZONING ISN'T APPROPRIATE THIS FAR FROM THE CENTRAL CAMPUS. THIS IS AN ANTIQUATED ZONING DISTRICT THAT WAS NOT USED CORRECTLY UNTIL THIS PROJECT IN LOWER TOWN AND IF WE HAD DONE THIS VERY SAME THING WITH THE LOWER TOWN PROJECT, WE WOULD HAVE OBTAINED A CONSIDERABLY LARGER CONTRIBUTION TO OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUN, BUT INSTEAD WE LET IT PASS THROUGH THROUGH A C1A ZONED CHANGE. I DISAGREE THAT WE HAVE ABSOLUTE DISCRETION IN REZONING. WE CAN SET A PRECEDENT WHERE IF WE HAVE DONE THIS TYPE OF REZONING FOR ONE PROPERTY OWNER AND WE DON'T DO IT FOR ANOTHER PROPERTY OWNER UNDER SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT THEY CAN SUE US FOR UNDER EQUAL PROTECTION ARGUMENT AND THOSE KIND OF CASES SUCCEED. WE HAVE TO LOOK AT WHAT TYPE OF PROJECTS WE WILL APPROVE AND ESPECIALLY WHEN IT INVOLVES REZONING. AND THIS, I HOPE, SENDS THE MESSAGE THAT C1A -- C1A ARE NOT WELCOMED OUT BEYOND THE CENTRAL CAMPUS AREA AND PUD ARE PREFERRED BECAUSE THEY DO WANT THE PUBLIC BENEFITS THAT ATTACH TO A PUD. I DON'T KNOW WHAT OBSTACLE THAT CREATES IF WE SEND A CLEAR MESSAGE THAT THIS IS OUR EXPECTATION.
03:21:56.813: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
03:21:59.316: >> Councilmember Grand: I THINK PUDs HAVE A LOT OF OBSTACLES IN THEM AND I WILL RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE IF A REZONING IT TIED TO A SITE PLAN, IT DOESN'T SET A PRESENCE DENT FOR ANYTHING OTHER THAN THAT SITE. AND SO THAT'S JUST FALSE. THIS LOWER TOWN INFORMATION, JUST BECAUSE YOU SAY THAT IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN A PUD, NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES A CERTAIN FIRST WARD RESIDENT DECIDES TO SAY IT DOESN'T MAKE IT TRUE. AND THIS COMES BA BEING TO AN EARLIER DISCUSSION ABOUT DENSITY. SOME OF US WANT TO NOT BE SERIOUS ABOUT DENSITY. SOME OF US WANT TO INSTILL FEAR WITH CHANGE IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD AND SOME OF US WANT TO UNDERSTAND OR ADVOCATE FOR THAT WE MAY HAVE TO CHANGE THE WAY WE DO HOUSING IN THIS CITY IN ORDER TO REACH OUR GOALS LIKE CASH OP NEUTRALITY -- CARBON NEUTRALITY. IT'S A PHILOSOPHICALLY DIFFERENCE, AND IF YOU WANT TO SEND A MESSAGE TO DEVELOPERS THAT WE WILL NEVER HAVE C1A, FINE. THAT'S NOT THE MESSAGE I WANT TO SEND. SO I WILL JUST RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE.
03:23:17.127: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER SMITH.
03:23:19.196: >> Councilmember Smith: YEAH, THERE'S PLENTY OF INDICATE LAW OUT THERE ABOUT HOW CONDITIONAL REZONINGS WORK. YOU KNOW, I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT AS WE TALK ABOUT THE C1A, YOU KNOW THIS IS -- THIS SITE IS 2500 FEET FROM THE MEDICAL CAMPUS. THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO ME TO BE THAT FAR. YOU KNOW, THAT'S ABOUT HOW FAR YOU WOULD WALK IF YOU HAD PARKED AT THE END OF A MEIJER PARKING LOT AND WALKED TO THE BACK OF THE STORE TO GET MILK. I THINK IT WAS CORRECT THAT COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN BROUGHT UP THE POINTS THAT I DON'T THINK THAT SUCCEEDED IN CHANGING, GOING TO THE PUD. I DON'T THINK IT CHANGED MUCH IN THE WAY OF MAKING THIS A BETTER PROJECT FOR THE COMMUNITY. IT JUST DELAYED THE PROCESS. SO LET'S HOPEFULLY JUST KEEP GOING.
03:24:09.279: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
03:24:10.213: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU. I WOULD LIKE TO CLARIFY THAT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS TO JUSTIFY THE PUD. SOIL CONTAMINATION REMOVAL, AESTHETICS, ELECTRIC PARKING STATION, BIKE PARKING, THE GREEN ROOF, OBVIOUSLY HOUSING AND WE HAVE THE PAYMENT OF THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING BENEFIT, WHICH WE WOULD NOT HAVE GOTTEN WITH THE -- WITH THE CAMPUS BUSINESS DISTRICT ZONING. AND SO AT THE END OF THE DAY IT'S A BETTER PRODUCT, AND DELIVERING ON LOTS OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS THAT WE PRESUMABLY VALUE. GREEN BENEFITS. AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING BENEFITS. THOSE WOULD MATTER. THOSE ARE IMPORTANT PUBLIC BENEFITS. SO THE OUTCOME HERE, THE RESULT IS A MUCH BETTER RESULT BECAUSE WE ARE DOING THIS THROUGH A PUD.
03:25:17.347: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN?
03:25:22.853: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANKS. I THINK ALL THE BENEFITS THAT WERE JUST CITED WERE INCLUDED IN THE ORIGINAL PROPOSAL UNDER PLANNED PROJECT. THE ONE ADDITION WAS THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUND CONTRIBUTION AND I APPRECIATE IT. I'M NOT GOING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT IT, BUT I WILL SAY THAT IN THE PROCESS OF DELAYING THIS, AND THEN ADDING THAT CONTRIBUTION, WE ALSO DID HAVE THE IMPACT OF RAISING THE SALE PRICE OF EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THE UNITS IN THIS BUILDING AND WHILE I DON'T EXPECT THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN AFFORDABLE TO LOW-INCOME FOLKS BEFORE AND NOW IT'S ONLY AVAILABLE TO AFFLUENT RESIDENTS, BUT THE MORE DIFFICULT WE MAKE THESE PROCESSES, THE LONGER WE MAKE THEM TAKE AND THE MORE THAT WE CHARGE PEOPLE, ALL OF THOSE COSTS GET PASSED DOWN TO THE PEOPLE WHO BUY THEM. IT'S NOT NECESSARILY CUTTING INTO THE DEVELOPER'S PROFITS WHICH I WISH -- YOU KNOW, I THINK WE ALL, YOU KNOW, IF WE COULD FIND A WAY TO TAX DEVELOP OUR PROJECTS, I THINK WE WOULD, BUT IT'S NOT LEGAL. AND THE END RESULT IS WE JUST MAKE THE HOUSING MORE EXPENSIVE FOR THE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE TO BUY IT.
03:26:33.990: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI AND AFTER HE GOES WE CAN CALL IT A DAY AND MOVE ON TO THE NEXT THING.
03:26:37.861: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANKS. I KNOW IT GOT LENGTHY HERE. I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR. I KNOW WE HEARD CONFLICTING VIEW POINTS. I WANTED TO ASK STAFF FOR CLARIFICATION FOR THE RECORD AS TO THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUND. WAS THAT AVAILABLE UNDER C1A? THAT'S ONE. IS IN A -- THIS IS SOMETHING THAT ONLY WE GOT UNDER WITH THE PUDs.
03:27:07.257: >> NO. ANY REZONING DOESN'T INHERENTLY REQUIRE ANY AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THE PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT IS THE ONLY DISTRICT THAT REQUIRES AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR THAT ZONING DISTRICT. NO NO CONTRIBUTION WOULD HAVE BEEN UNDER DISCUSSION UNDER THE C1A.
03:27:32.148: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I APPRECIATE THAT. AGAIN, IT'S JUST FOR THE RECORD. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT NEARLY $100,000 TO THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING TRUST FUND IS NOTHING NO SNEEZE AT. IT IS -- I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY FORK OVER $100,000. I THINK IT'S SIGNIFICANT AND, YOU KNOW IF WE WENT ON PRIOR CONVERSATIONS THAT OTHER MEMBERS HERE HAVE HAD ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING, AND KNOW THAT WE CAN LEVERAGE THAT $100,000, THAT'S ANYWHERE FROM $500,000 TO $2.5 MILLION. I DON'T KNOW WHAT NUMBER YOU WANT TO USE, BUT I JUST WANT TO PUT THAT OUT THERE FOR THE RECORD. THANK YOU.
03:28:18.428: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER
03:28:20.196: >> Councilmember Grand: MR. LENA RT FOR THE RECORD, HOW MANY ADDITIONAL HOURS OF STAFF TIME WENT INTO THIS PROJECT FROM WHEN IT WAS FIRST PROPOSED TO WHERE WE ARE TODAY? BALLPARK?
03:28:32.609: >> I GUESS I -- I DON'T KNOW. IT WAS A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF HOURS, BUT KEEP IN MIND THE PETITIONER ALSO HAD TO PAY ANOTHER APPLICATION FEE THAT HELPS OFFSET SOME OF THAT TIME. SO I REALLY WOULDN'T WANT TO SPECULATE, BUT IT WAS -- WHILE IT WAS PROBABLY MORE EFFICIENT THAN MAYBE COMPARABLE PROJECTS BECAUSE WE ALREADY COMPLETED THE TECHNICAL REVIEW, I WOULD SAY THAT THE TIME DEVOTED TO CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE PUD REQUIREMENTS WERE PROBABLY -- IT PROBABLY BROUGHT IT UP TO A SIMILAR-SIZED PROJECT.
03:29:12.148: >> Councilmember Grand: OKAY. THANK YOU. JUST THE POINT THAT THERE'S COSTS TO DOING EVERYTHING AND THERE'S COSTS TO THE CITY IN TERMS OF STAFF TIME THAT COULD BE USED FOR OTHER PRIORITIES. THANKS.
03:29:25.495: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] ALL OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. DB-1, RESOLUTION TO APPROVE THE GARNET PUD SITE PLAN AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT, 325 EAST SUMMIT STREET. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, SECONDED BY EATON. DISCUSSION OF DB-1. COUNCILMEMBER EATON. I'M SORRY. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER. MY APOLOGIES, COUNCILMEMBER.
03:29:58.228: >> Councilmember Hayner: OKAY. THANKS. WELL, I'M HAPPY TO SEE THAT THIS PROJECT IS HERE. IT'S NOT THE SAME PROJECT WE HAD BEFORE. IT'S NOT THE SAME RESULT. IT BENEFITS THE CITY IN A WAY AND I APPRECIATE THE DEVELOPER AND THE ARCHITECT AND SO ON PUTTING THAT FORWARD. I KNOW IT WILL MAKE EACH OF THESE UNITS COST A LITTLE BIT MORE, WELL, YOU KNOW, THAT'S NOT ON US. THAT'S ON THE DEVELOPER WHEN STAFF HAS TO SPEND MORE TIME. I'M NOT SHEDDING A TEAR FOR THAT EITHER. YES THIS NOTION WHEN WE STRUGGLE FOR A PROJECT, WHATEVER THE PUBLIC BENEFITS ARE, IT'S SOMEHOW OUR FAULT FOR RAISING A PRICE AND CREATING UNAFFORDABILITY IS REALLY LUDICROUS. IT -- THIS IS AN EXPENSIVE PROJECT NO MATTER WHAT'S GOING DOWN WITH IT, CLEARLY. THE LAND COSTS IN THE CITY, ALL OF THOSE THINGS, ALREADY ELEVATE OUR COSTS ON PROJECTS. AND IF YOU SUBSCRIBE TO THE FILTERING SCHEMES THAT ARE PUT FORWARD WITH BUILD, BUILD, BUILD, AND EVENTUALLY SOME AFFORDABILITY WILL COME OUT OF IT, IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW MUCH IT COSTS AT THE TOP END. AND WE SEE HOW POORLY THAT WORKS IN COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE -- AND STATES ALSO THAT HAVE D HIGH DEMAND PRESSURE ON OUR LAND. I'M JUST NOT BUYING IT THAT WE HAVE DONE SOMETHING HORRIBLE HERE BY TRYING TO GET $100,000 FOR OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING TRUST FUND. TO THE PROJECT ITSELF, YOU KNOW, NOT ALL THE NEIGHBORS WANTED TO SEE THIS. WE HAD COMPLAINTS FROM ADJACENT NEIGHBORS AND POP SIGNIFICANCE TO IT FROM -- OPPOSITION TO IT FROM ONE OR TWO ADJACENT NEIGHBORS AND I WOULD IMAGINE THAT STILL STANDS AS IT KIND OF WENT AWAY AND CAME BACK. I THINK THE INTEREST IN OPPOSING IT WAS LOST. I CAN'T SPEAK FULLY TO THAT, BUT I -- I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM THAT NEIGHBOR, WHO OWNS A BUSINESS AND IT IS IN WARD ONE. AND SO I'M GOING TO GO WITH THE ASSUMPTION THAT THAT COMPLAINT HAS BEEN DROPPED. AND, Y YOU KNOW, NOT EVERYBODY WANTS TO SEE THIS, BUT THEY ARE GOING TO SEE IT. THE -- THE BENEFITS THAT COUNCILWOMAN LUMM OUTLINED THAT ARE GIVEN UNDER THIS PUD WITH THE SAME PROJECT, THE SAME PHYSICAL PROJECT ARE CURIOUSLY SOME OF THE SAME ONES THAT WERE OFFERED UP ON THE ARCHITECT'S 616 PROJECT THAT DIDN'T GET ANY PUBLIC BENEFITS AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ON THIS BODY WERE RUNNING -- WERE BESIDE THEMSELVES WITH PRAISING THE COLORRIES OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFITS THAT CAME WITH 616. BUT THEY ARE DISSING ON THESE. I GUESS IT DEPENDS WHERE IT WAS BUILT. IT'S JUST LIKE THIS DENSITY ARGUMENT. I DON'T PRAISE OR SHUN DENSITY IN AND OF ITSELF. I THINK DENSITY IS A STRANGE METRIC BY WHICH TO MEASURE THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN A CITY, AND I KNOW THAT IT'S EASIER FOR SOME FOLKS TO PRAISE DENSITY IN NEIGHBORHOODS WHEN THEY ARE WELL AWARE THAT IT ISN'T GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT DOOR TO THEM. AND SO THAT'S WHERE I STAND ON THAT MATTER. I THINK IT -- I THINK IT DEPENDS ON WHERE YOU ARE LOOKING FROM. AND WHERE I'M LOOKING FROM, I REALLY DON'T CARE EITHER WAY ON THIS. I'M HAPPY TO TAKE THE -- THE MONEY FOR THE TRUST AND I'M DISAPPOINTING THAT IT ISN'T AN ALL ELECTRIC BUILDING. IT'S REALLY WHAT WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME EARLIER ON ON CA-7, TALKING ABOUT HOW URGENT IT IS FOR CLIMATE CHANGE BUT YOU ARE PERFECTLY WILLING TO SAY BUILD A BUILDING THAT IS HEATED WITH NATURAL GAS AND PROBABLY WILL BE FOR THE ETERNITY. BUILDING ELECTRIC BY CHOICE, WHICH IS ALL WE HAVE RIGHT NOW IS AN IMPORTANT ONE FOR US TO CONSIDER THAT WE ARE SHOULD BE LOOKING FOR DEVELOPERS WHO WANT TO BUILD THE TYPES OF BUILDINGS THAT WE ARE GOING TO WANT TO SEE IN 2030. AND UNFORTUNATELY THIS ISN'T ONE. HOW FAR, I WILL SUPPORT IT, BECAUSE IT'S -- IT IS WHAT IT IS, AND, YOU KNOW, I'M SURE WE NEED TEN MORE HALF MILLION DOLLARS UNITS. WHAT CAN I SEE? THERE SEEMS TO BE A DEMAND FOR HIGH-END HOUSING IN THIS TOWN AND THIS WILL FILL A LITTLE BIT OF IT. AND, YOU KNOW, THESE FOLKS ARE GOING TO ENJOY THEIR VIEW UNTIL MISCHCON SITE GETS DEVELOPED AND THEN THEY MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE ANYMORE, BUT THAT'S WHAT YOU GET FOR LIVING IN THE BIG CITY. THANKS TO THE ARCHITECT FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND MAKING SOME EFFORTS TO BE TENSETIVE WITH THE MATERIAL SELECTIONS AND -- SENSITIVE WITH THE MATERIAL SELECTIONS AND SO FORTH IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS AND I JUST -- I JUST -- I THINK IT'S GOING TO -- IT'S GOING TO -- I MEAN I KNOW IF YOU STOOD ON THE SITE, IF YOU STOOD ON THE CURRENT SITE, YOU STRAND ON THE BRIDGE AND SO -- IF YOU STAND ON THE BRIDGE AND SO ON, IT WILL LOOK A LOT BIGGER THAN IT DOES IN THE DRAWINGS AND SO THAT'S OKAY FOR THIS LOCATION NOW, I GUESS, AND FOREVER. AND SO YOU KNOW, WE WILL SEE HOW IT ALL PANS OUT. I -- I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT THERE'S SOME CLEANUP ON THIS SITE. YOU GUYS MAY OR MAY NOT BE AWARE THAT THE TWO SITES THAT ARE EXACTLY TO THE SOUTH OF THIS, ADJACENT TO THE SOUTH OF THIS ARE RIDDLED WITH WELL COVERS AND WELLS TESTING WELLS AND SAMPLING WELLS. AND SO MISCHCON AND NOW DTE OWES THOSE TWO SITES SOME SERIOUS CLEANUP. I'M NOT SURE HOW THIS IS GOING TO PUSH ALL THAT AROUND, IF THERE'S GOING TO BE ANY EFFECT, BUT I JUST HOPE WHEN WE APPROVE THIS SITE PLAN THAT THERE ARE GUARANTEES IN THE DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT THAT PROTECT THE ADJACENT SITES AND THE CONCERNS OVER CLEANUP THAT THOSE ADJACENT SITES HAVE, BECAUSE I COUNTED -- I THINK I COUNTED 11 TESTING WELLS BETWEEN THOSE TWO AND A HALF PARCELS ELECTRIC. AND SO THERE -- PARCELS THERE. AND SO THERE'S SOME CONCERNS ON THAT SITE. SO MOVING FORWARD, I JUST WANT TO MAKE THE PETITIONER AWARE -- I'M SURE THEY ARE WELL AWARE OF WHAT IS GOING ON THERE AND LET'S HOPE IT -- THE WORK ON THIS SITE DOESN'T ADVERSELY IMPACT THE NEIGHBORS. THANK YOU.
03:36:38.194: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
03:36:39.495: >> Councilmember Eaton: THANK YOU. TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THE ZONING RESOLUTION, I MOVE TO AMEND P18 OF THE DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT TO READ AS FOLLOWS. P18 FOR THE WENT  BENEFITS OF TE RESIDENTS OF ANN ARBOR, THE DEVELOPER SHOULD MAKE A CONTRIBUTION OF $88,000.200 PRIOR TO THE ISSUANCE OF BUILDING PERMITS. THAT WAS CIRCULATED IN THAT PREVIOUS EMAIL WITH MY PRIOR AMENDMENT.
03:37:12.095: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE A SECOND? SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM. COUNCILMEMBER EATON, IS THAT FRIENDLY?
03:37:22.905: >> Mayor Taylor: FRIENDLY TO THE BODY.
03:37:24.907: >> Councilmember Eaton: THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY.
03:37:28.444: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN MOTION AS AMENDED. ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. RESOLUTION NO. 4 - CONFIRMING THE PROPOSED JACKSON AVENUE SIDEWALK GAP PROJECT SPECIAL ASSESSMENT, DISTRICT #61. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI. SECONDEDBY COUNCILMEMBER SMITH. DISCUSSION OF DS-1. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
03:37:58.474: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: SORRY, I DIDN'T USE THE OTHER WAY.
03:38:01.711: >> Mayor Taylor: NO WORRIES.
03:38:02.612: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YEAH, I RECEIVED QUITE A BIT OF COMMUNICATION -- COMMUNICATIONS FROM CONSTITUENTS IN THE AREA THAT SOME WERE AWARE OF AS CALLERS DURING THE PUBLIC HEARING KNEW ABOUT THIS ASSESSMENT BACK IN APRIL. MANY OF THE OTHER NEIGHBORS DID NOT KNOW BECAUSE BECAUSE OF THE INCORRECT ADDRESS. SOME RESIDENTS SAID THE MAIL WAS SENT TO DIFFERENT MAILING ADDRESSES. I GOT A FLOOD OF EMAILS AND PHONE CALLS AROUND THIS. IT WAS FLYING UNDER THE RADAR UNTIL NOW, WITHOUT OPPOSITION, AND NOW WE HAVE HEAVY OPPOSITION. I'M CONFUSED AS WHETHER THIS REQUIRES AN EIGHT VOTE OR IF THIS IS STILL THE NORMAL NUMBER OF VOTES REQUIRED FOR THIS RESOLUTION.
03:39:12.682: >> Mayor Taylor: MS. BEAUDRY.
03:39:15.618: >> Clerk Beaudry: I'M MOVING THE CITY ASSESSOR OVER AT THIS TIME. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT IT DOES NOT HAVE THE NUMBER OF PROTESTS TO MEET THE EIGHT VOTE REQUIREMENT.
03:39:23.259: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: OKAY. AND THEN -- LET ME KNOW IF THAT'S ANYTHING DIFFERENT. I WILL MOVE TO POSTPONE THIS AND I WOULD LIKE TO ASK STAFF WHAT THAT DOES TO THE CONSTRUCTION SCHEDULE, WHETHER THAT WILL DELAY THE CONSTRUCTION OF THIS PROJECT, IF IT IS POSTPONED UNTIL THE SECOND MEETING IN JUNE.
03:40:02.498: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE ANY
03:40:03.266: >> City Admin. Crawford: MR. NEA RING.
03:40:06.535: >> CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW?
03:40:08.537: >> Mayor Taylor: YOU BET.
03:40:09.272: >> I DIDN'T -- AS JACKIE WAS PROMOTING TO A PANELIST, MY SCREEN WENT BLANK AND SO I COULDN'T HEAR THE QUESTION. COULD YOU PLEASE REPEAT IT.
03:40:17.246: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANKS, MICHAEL, FOR JOINING US. I JUST HAVE CONCERNS ON THIS PROJECT AND I'M ASKING FOR POSTPONEMENT, PERHAPS TO THE SECOND MEETING IN JUNE. AND IN DOING SO, WHAT DOES THAT DO TO THE CONSTRUCTION SCHEDULE OF THIS PROJECT, DOES IT -- DO WE MISS OUT ON THE ENTIRE CONSTRUCTION SEASON WITH DOING THAT?
03:40:37.233: >> NO. WE'RE GOING TO WORK ON THE WASHTENAW AVENUE SIDEWALK FIRST AND SO IF WE POSTPONE THIS TO THE FIRST MEETING IN JUNE, IT WILL HAVE NO EFFECT ON THE CONSTRUCTION SCHEDULE IF WE DO ACT ON IT IN THE JUNE MEETING.
03:40:50.680: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  IT WOULD BE THE SECOND MEETING IN JUNE.
03:40:53.382: >> OKAY. I THINK THAT'S STILL FINE. WE WON'T GET THERE UNTIL AT LEAST UNTIL JULY.
03:41:01.657: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: WELL, THANK YOU. I WILL -- WILL MOVE TO HAVE IT POSTPONED, AND PERHAPS -- I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WILL CONCLUDE MY ABILITY TO WEIGH IN ON THE CONVERSATION, BECAUSE I HAVE A FEW OTHER COMMENTS TO MAKE ON THIS. SO I APOLOGIZE BUT PARLIAMENTARY SPEAKING SHOULD I INCLUDE MY COMMENTS NOW?
03:41:30.986: >> Mayor Taylor: I GUESS THE PURPOSE OF THE POSTPONEMENT IS LARGELY TO PUT IT ON TO ANOTHER MEETING BUT IF HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY ON THE SUBSTANCE, I -- WE SEND TO GET IF A IRRELEVANTLY LOOSE ABOUT THAT.
03:41:40.363: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU.
03:41:41.831: >> Mayor Taylor: SAY WHAT YOU WILL BE BUT BE COOL.
03:41:44.533: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I WILL TRY. WE GOT OVER THE CALM SENSE MOMENT. I HAVE THE AC GOING.
03:41:52.108: >> Mayor Taylor: THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT, BUT OKAY.
03:41:55.611: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  SO BACK IN APRIL, APRIL 6th, THERE WAS A COUNCIL MOTION TO REAPPROPRIATE $100,000 FROM THE SIDEWALK GAP PROGRAM WHERE IT WAS FUNDED FOR FISCAL YEAR '20. THAT WOULD HAVE OFFSET THE ASSESSMENTS ON BARTON AND OFFSET THE REQUIREMENTS ON JACKSON. IT WAS AN EIGHT VOTE REQUIREMENT. IT ONLY GARNERED SEVEN VOTES. AND I'M ACTUALLY JUST TRYING TO SEE IF I CAN CONVINCE ONE OTHER PERSON AT THE TABLE HERE THAT IT'S ACTUALLY A GOOD USE OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS IN THESE INSTANCES AS WE HEARD ONE OF THE PROPERTY OWNERS IS LOOKING AT $52,000 ASSESSMENT FOR A SIDEWALK THAT THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE A HOUSE ON. WE HEARD OF A LOT OF THE PAINFUL IMPLICATIONS TO THE PEOPLE ON BARTON. SO I HAVE ASKED OUR CITY ADD%ER AND STAFF. I HAVEN'T RECEIVED ANYTHING BACK YET. BUT I WOULD LIKE TO PERHAPS BRING THAT BACK FOR FURTHER CONSIDERATION WHEN WE TALK MORE ON THIS PROJECT.
03:43:15.524: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. DID I GET A SECOND ON THE POSTPONEMENT? SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER SMITH.
03:43:22.598: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU.
03:43:24.900: >> Clerk Beaudry: IS THAT TO THE SECOND MEETING IN JUNE?
03:43:27.236: >> Mayor Taylor: THE SECOND MEETING IN JUNE, YES. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER ON THE POSTPONEMENT.
03:43:33.142: >> Councilmember Hayner: YEAH, I WILL SUPPORT THIS, AS LONG AS IT IS NOT INTERFERING WITH THE CONSTRUCTION SEASON. AS WE HEARD FROM THOSE FOLKS AT THE PUBLIC HEARING, THIS IS PRETTY SERIOUS BURDEN, AND WE ARE ALSO CREATING AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A SIDEWALK THAT IS NOT GOING TO BE PROPERLY MAINTAINED IN A CYCLE OF TICKETING, HARASSMENT AND DISPLEASURE WHO DO TRY TO MISUSE IT. I KNOW THE PROPERTY IS VACANT SOMETIMES. IT'S SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS THE -- THE FORMER LOCKWOOD POTENTIAL SITE. THERE'S -- THERE'S NOBODY LIVING THERE. AND WE HAVE EVEN MADE SOME EFFORTS, I BELIEVE, TO TRY AND GET THAT INTO OUR ACQUISITION PROGRAMS BECAUSE OF THE ADJACENT TO THE DOLPH PARK AND THE BIRD FLYWAY. IT'S ASSUMER BAD THAT WE ARE IT HITTING THESE PEOPLE UP FOR $50,000. THE PURPOSEFUL USE OF THE SIDEWALK FUNDS THAT WERE SET ASIDE IS FOR SIDEWALKS THAT ARE INITIATED FROM RESIDENTS WOULD WANT TO FILL A SIDEWALK GAP WOULD SEE A DESPERATE NEED TO FILL A SIDEWALK, THE RESIDENT SIDEWALK GAPS. WE ARE VERY CLEAR FOR THAT. I'M ALL FOR STAFF FINDING BETTER WAYS TO PAY FOR SIDEWALKS TO PAY FOR THESE COMMON GOODS. I SAID IT BEFORE AND I WILL SAY IT AGAIN AND IF I NEED TO COME UP WITH A RESOLUTION TO DO THAT, I WOULD, AND I WOULD LIKE SOMEONE FROM STAFF TO DO THAT WITH ME. IT HAS TO SWITCH OVER TO -- THE WOMAN TALKING ABOUT THEY ARE BOTH OUT OF WORK. HOW ARE THIS HE GOING TO PAY FOR THIS? IT'S RIDICULOUS. I'M SORRY THAT IT DOESN'T MEET THE PURPOSEFUL USE OF THE RESIDENT INITIATED SIDEWALK GAP PROGRAM, BUT IT DOESN'T. AND THAT WAS SET ASIDE AND APPROVED FOR VERY GOOD REASON AND I'M GOING TO SUPPORT SETTING THIS OFF FOR A COUPLE OF MEETINGS AND HOPE THAT WE CAN COME TO A BETTER RESOLUTION WITH THE OWNERS AND WITH METHODS TO PAY BEFORE THEN. THANK YOU.
03:45:46.575: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER SMITH AND BANNISTER ON THE POSTPONEMENT.
03:45:50.846: >> Councilmember Smith: YES, I WILL SUPPORT THE POSTPONEMENT. IT WILL GIVE ME A CHANCE WORK WITH COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER FOR A DIFFERENT FUTURE ON HOW WE DO THIS STUFF. I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT. AT THE END OF THE DAY, THE -- YOU KNOW, THE MA TRUST THAT'S BASED IN CALIFORNIA THAT OWNS THE FORMER -- THE SITE THAT WE LOOKED AT FOR LOCKWOOD, YOU KNOW, I UNDERSTAND THIS IS A BIG HIT. IT'S -- YOU KNOW, WHAT OUR CITY POLICY IS, AT THE END OF THE DAY, YOU KNOW, GIVEN HOW WE WOULD VOTE ON IT. WE HAVE TO LOOK AT A CREATIVE PAYMENT PLAN OPPORTUNITY. THIS IS A NEIGHBORHOOD THAT'S NOT CONNECTED TO ANYTHING BY PEDESTRIAN OR BIKEWAY. YOU KNOW? AND I THINK THAT THAT IS A CONCERN AND I THINK WE ARE TRYING TO ELIMINATE THESE GAPS AND ENCOURAGE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION IN OUR COMMUNITY AND I THINK IF WE CAN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THAT, THEN WE'RE NOT GOING TO MOVE VERY MUCH OF OUR -- CERTAINLY OUR CARBON NEUTRALITY AGENDA FORWARD BUT WE WON'T MOVE MUCH FORWARD IN THE WAY OF PEDESTRIAN SAFETY OR PEDESTRIAN TRANSPORTATION. I WILL SUPPORT THE POSTPONEMENT, BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, I THINK WE NEED TO BE AS CREATIVE AS POSSIBLE AND TRY TO GET THIS ON DO. I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT GAP TO FILL.
03:47:18.901: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
03:47:19.902: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES, I HAD A QUESTION FOR STAFF. I THINK ON THIS, MAYBE MR. CRAWFORD, THIS MORNING AT LIKE 10:48 OR SO, I SENT A FEW OF US AN EMAIL ABOUT HOW THIS JACKSON AVENUE SIDEWALK PROJECT HAS HAPPENED TO SOON IN THE SAME MONTH AS THE BARTON DRIVE AND THE NIXON TRAVER SIDEWALKS THAT WE TURNED DOWN. AND NOW WE ARE ADDING JACKSON NOW, OUR THIRD ONE THAT HAS NEIGHBORHOOD OPPOSITION, IS THERE SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO DO PROCEDURALLY TONIGHT TO INCLUDE BARTON AND NIXON AND TRAVER ABOUT OTHER WAYS TO HANDLE JACKSON AVENUE TOO?
03:48:18.660: >> SORRY, COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER, I HAVE STARTED A COLLABORATION WITH THE ATTORNEY'S OFFICE ABOUT YOUR QUESTION, BUT WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO RESPOND TO YOU YET.
03:48:33.876: >> Councilmember Bannister: I'M WONDERING IF WE BRING IT BACK AS OUR NORMAL PROCEDURE, WHERE, YOU KNOW, I WAS ON THE PREVAILING SIDE WITH NIXON TRAVER. SO I COULD BRING THAT BACK, AND THEN COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI WAS ON THE PREVAILING SIDE WITH BARTON. DO WE NEED TO BRING THAT BACK TONIGHT IF WE DO COME UP WITH A STRATEGY?
03:48:59.601: >> City Admin. Crawford: MANY POSTEMA, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU ARE ABLE TO ANSWER THAT.
03:49:07.376: >> City Atty. Postema: I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU WOULD HAVE TO BRING IT BACK TONIGHT.
03:49:09.378: >> Councilmember Bannister: OKAY. SO THOSE OTHER -- ALL THREE PROJECTS COULD BE INCLUDED IN OUR SOURCE OF FUNDING ANALYSIS?
03:49:20.389: >> City Atty. Postema: YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT -- ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT WHEN YOU CAN BRING BACK A MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION? IS THAT YOUR QUESTION?
03:49:26.562: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES, AND I JUST DIDN'T WANT BARTON DRIVE AND NIXON ROAD TO GET EXCLUDED BECAUSE WE DIDN'T BRING THEM BACK.
03:49:37.906: >> City Atty. Postema: WELL, TO BRING THEM BACK, YOU CAN BRING THEM BACK AT THE NEXT MEETING WITH THE PREVAILING -- SOMEONE ON THE PREVAILING SIDE OR IF IT'S AT A LATER SIDE, NOT THE NEXT MEETING, YOU CAN JUST WAIVE THE REQUIREMENT AND BRING IT BACK AT EVEN LATER TIME. THAT'S IN THE COUNCIL RULES AS.
03:49:58.660: >> Councilmember Bannister: OH, GREAT. I DIDN'T KNOW THAT, AND -- OKAY. SO THAT WILL BE GREAT. THERE IS SOME DISCRETION IN HERE, AND I THINK EQUITY AND TIMING ISSUE WITH THE PANDEMIC, THAT WE DON'T KNOW THE PERSONAL FINANCES OF THESE HOMEOWNERS AND THEY COULD BE VULNERABLE AND SO THROUGH THE LENS OF PANDEMIC AND ALL, I THINK IT'S EXCITING AND WISE THAT A FEW OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE WANT TO LOOK INTO OTHER POSSIBLE WAYS TO FUND IT. SOMETIMES WE TALK ABOUT THE 149 MILES OF SIDEWALK GAPS ALL OVER IN ALL THE NEIGHBORHOODS, AND I HAVE CHANGED MYOPIY MY THINKINGON THAT BECAUSE IN RE ACTUALLY ONLY INSTALL 1.25 TO 2.75 MILES OF NEW SIDEWALK IN A WHOLE YEAR. SO I THINK INSTEAD OF THINKING ABOUT $150 MILLION, IF WE BREAK IT DOWN INTO THE SMALLER BITE-SIZED CHUNKS OF A MILE OR TWO A YEAR, WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO AFFORD MORE SIDEWALK THAN WE THOUGHT.
03:51:26.348: >> City Admin. Crawford: COUNCI. AS YOU THINK OF THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THIS TO FOR YOUR RESIDENTS YOU REFERRED TO THE ILL PACIMPACT OF THE CORONAVIRU. ONE OPTION YOU HAVE IS TO ESTABLISH A PAYMENT PLAN WITH NO PAYMENT OR $1 PAYMENT THE FIRST YEAR. THAT IN ESSENCE GETS IT KICKED OUT SOME IF THAT'S A SHORT-TERM CONCERN.
03:51:48.670: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE POSTPONEMENT.
03:51:52.341: >> Councilmember Smith: JUST A QUESTION, MR. CRAWFORD WOULD THAT ACTION OF CREATING THAT PAYMENT PLAN HAVE TO HAPPEN TONIGHT?
03:52:01.416: >> City Admin. Crawford: IF YOU WERE APPROVING IT TONIGHT, MR. MARKEY, CAN YOU CONFIRM? I THINK IT -- I'M NOT SURE THAT DOES.
03:52:08.557: >> Mayor Taylor: WE WILL BE POSTPONING IT.
03:52:13.996: >> City Admin. Crawford: WE'LL GET BACK TO YOU.
03:52:19.067: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF POSTPONEMENT. ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT IS POSTPONED. B2, AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND SECTION 2:64 OF CHAPTER 29 (SEWER RATES) OF TITLE II OF THE CODE OF THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. MOVED BY MR. RAMLAWI, AND SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRAND. DISCUSSION OF B-2. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
03:52:45.560: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I WILL BE OFFERING AN AMENDMENT ON WATER RATES IN A MINUTE, BUT WILL BE SUPPORTING THE PROPOSED RATE INCREASES IN SEWER AND STORMWATER AND SO MY COMMENTS HERE SPEAK TO BOTH OF THOSE AND I WILL BE BRIEF. IN MY OPINION, REINVESTING IN OUR INFRASTRUCTURE IS A FUNDAMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY AND HIGH PRIORITY FOR US. WE DON'T NEED TO LOOK ANY FURTHER THAN A SEWAGE BILLS WE HAVE EXPERIENCED RECENTLY FOR THE PROOF OF THE NEED FOR RE-INVESTMENT IN OUR SEWER SYSTEM. I WAS ALSO ENCOURAGED TO SEE THAT THE SEWER IS NOT JUST CITY CUSTOMERS BEING ASKED TO PAY MORE, THE TOWNSHIP USING CITY SERVICES WILL BE PAYING 8.7% MORE ARE FOR SEWER IN FISCAL YEAR '21 AND FOR STORMWATER THIS REPRESENTS THE LAST YEAR OF A FOUR-YEAR COMMITMENT WE MAKE WITH SUBSTANTIAL UPGRADES IN STORMWATER SYSTEMS AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON THAT COMMITMENT. AFTER THIS YEAR'S SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE, STAFF INDICATES THE INCREASES GOING FORWARD WILL BE MORE REASONABLE, AND THE 4 TO 5% RANGE. NO ONE LIKES INCREASING RATES, LEAST OF ALL ME, ESPECIALLY NOW BUT CONSIDERING THE COMPELLING NEEDS TO RE-INVEST IN SYSTEM INFRASTRUCTURE, COUPLED WITH THE FACT THAT COVID-19 HAS AND IS ADVERSELY IMPACTING WATER REVENUES I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE SEWER AND THE WATER INCREASES. THANK YOU.
03:54:16.852: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR. [CHORUS OF AYES] I'M SORRY, COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, DID YOU WANT TO GET IN ON THAT BEFORE I PULLED THAT VOTE BACK?
03:54:30.632: >> Councilmember Hayner: WELL, I WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT I THINK WE GOT AN EMAIL FROM THE CLERK OR SOMEONE FORWARDED TO US THAT THERE WAS SOMEBODY WHO TRIED TO CALL IN AND SAY PLEASE DON'T RAISE MY STORMWATER SEWER AND SANITARY SEWER RATES BECAUSE I'M BROKE, BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE IN TROUBLE RIGHT NOW. I WANTED TO THROW THAT OUT THERE ON BEHALF OF THE RESIDENT WHO WAS APPARENTLY HAVING TROUBLE GETTING THROUGH ON THE PUBLIC HEARING ON THIS PART. THERE WAS A CONCERN EXPRESSED BY A RESIDENT THAT THIS CONSTANT RATE RISING IS A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE TO PEOPLE WHO ARE ON FIXED INCOMES OR IN TODAY'S SAD WORLD ZERO INCOMES. SO I JUST WANTED TO PUT THAT OUT THERE. THANK YOU.
03:55:21.983: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. CRAWFORD?
03:55:25.554: >> City Admin. Crawford: THANK YOU, MAYOR TAK MAYOR TAYLOR. THE CITY HAS A BARRIER BUSTER PROGRAMS AND AS WE GET THOSE MESSAGES I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO REFER THEM TO TERESA GIGLIOTTI.
03:55:42.971: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE SEWER RATES, B2? MAR AALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? THEY ARE APPROVED. B-3, AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND SECTION 2:63 OF CHAPTER 29 (WATER RATES) OF TITLE II OF THE CODE OF THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRAND, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER SMITH. DISCUSSION OF B2 -- PARDON ME, B3, COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
03:56:12.033: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I HAVE AN AMENDMENT AND I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE THE AMENDMENT TO HIS ITEM B-3:0 3. I SENT IT TO ALL OF YOU ON FRIDAY AND RESENT IT AT THE START OF THIS MEETING SO I'M HOPEFUL YOU ALL HAVE IT. AGAIN, THIS IS THE WATER RATE AMENDMENT, PREVIOUSLY FORWARDED AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS AMENDMENT ACTUALLY DOES AND DOES NOT DO. FIRST, SHOULD I MOVE THE AMENDMENT?
03:56:54.009: >> Mayor Taylor: PLEASE.
03:56:54.743: >> Councilmember Lumm: OKAY. SO I'M MOVING AND PROPOSING THIS AMENDMENT. MAY I SPEAK TO IT NOW?
03:57:05.287: >> Mayor Taylor: MOVE THE AMENDMENT AND THEN WE'LL GET A SECOND AND YOU CAN DISCUSS ON THE MERITS.
03:57:10.759: >> Councilmember Lumm: I SENT IT TO YOU A FEW DAYS AGO AND TO THE CITY STAFF LAST WEEK.
03:57:16.631: >> Clerk Beaudry: I JUST FORWARDED IT COUNCIL MEMBER LUMM.
03:57:20.235: >> Councilmember Lumm: I'M SORRY?
03:57:21.369: >> Clerk Beaudry: I JUST FORWARDED IT NOW.
03:57:23.471: >> Councilmember Lumm: TO WHAT THIS --
03:57:26.207: >> Mayor Taylor: I THINK WE CAN GET TO THE RESOLVE CLAUSES? I LEAVE IT TO YOUR DISCRETION? YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
03:57:32.580: >> Councilmember Lumm: OKAY. I WON'T REREAD THE AMENDMENT. IT DOES NOT REDUCE THE INCREMENTAL REVENUES TO THE WATER SYSTEM. BUT JUST DELAYS THEM FOR SIX MONTHS. IT QUITE EXPLICITLY, IN THE SECOND RESOLVE CLAUSE SAYS THAT, QUOTE, CITY COUNCIL AUTHORIZES THAT THE INCREMENTAL REVENUE LOST TO THE WATER SYSTEM AS A RESULT OF THE SIX-MONTH DEFERRAL BE RECOVERED IN THE JANUARY 1, 2021 INCREASE END QUOTE. SO PLEASE DON'T SAY THIS ROBS THE WATER SYSTEM OF NEEDED REVENUE. IT DOES NOT DO THAT. I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THAT BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN WATER INFRASTRUCTURE IS MOST IMPORTANT AND I FULLY RECOGNIZE THAT THEY HAVE BEEN ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY COVID-19. WHAT THE AMENDMENT DOES DO IS DEFER THE INCREASE FROM JULY 1, 2020, TO JANUARY 1, 2021 AND TAKE THAT SIX-MONTH PERIOD TO REDO THE WATER IN JULY OF 2018. A RESTRUCTURE THAT A FEW OF US ON COUNCIL ARE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH AND REALLY DON'T LIKE BUILDING UPON WITH FURTHER INCREASES YEAR AFTER YEAR. SPECIFICALLY THE AMENDMENT DIRECTS STAFF TO REVIEW THE RATE STRUCTURES PRESENTED BY ARKADIS AN PRESENT TO COUNCIL BEFORE JANUARY 2021 A RECOMMENDED STRUCTURE THAT'S FEASIBLE, LEGAL, AND ADDRESSES COUNCIL'S CONCERNS REGARDING ONE, THE WIDE RANGE OF PER GALLON CHARGES IN ANN ARBOR'S RESIDENTIAL CLASS, TWO THE LACK OF TIERING OR ANY MECHANISM IN THE SPECIAL CUSTOMER CLASS RATE STRUCTURE TO INCENTIVIZE CONSERVATION AND TO REFLECT THE SYSTEM COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PEAKING, THREE THE VALIDITY OF THE COST OF SERVICE STUDIES GIVEN THE ACTUAL YOU EXPERIENCES SUBSEQUENT TO THE RESTRUCTURING. THERE'S NOT TIME TO COVER WHY THESE PARTICULAR CONCERNS ARE AT THE FOREFRONT. THERE'S ADDITIONAL RATIONALE IN THE WHEREAS CLAUSES AND WE HAVE DISCUSSED THEM SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE. THE DEFERRAL PROVIDES A SMALL BIT OF TEMPORARY RELIEF FOR CUSTOMERS, BUT THE RESOLUTION PLACES ON THE RECORD THAT COUNCIL REALLY DOES NOT WANT TO REVISIT THE WATER RATE RESTRICTURING IN 2018, AND WANTS AND NEEDS STAFF TO ASSIST IN THAT PROCESS. AGAIN, I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THIS DOES NOT TAKE MONEY AWAY FROM THE WATER SYSTEM. THE QUESTIONS -- IS THAT COMING FROM ME? I APOLOGIZE. THE QUESTION COUNCILMEMBERS NEED ASK THEMSELVES IS WHETHER OR NOT YOU BELIEVE -- [ BACKGROUND NOISE ] THE WATER RATE IN 2019. IF YOU THINK THAT, IT SHOULD SUPPORT IT. IF NOT, YOU SHOULDN'T. OBVIOUSLY I BELIEVE WE SHOULD. AND I HOPE THAT YOU WILL AGREE IN ANY EVENT, THANK YOU FOR LISTENING.
04:00:54.582: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE A SECOND? SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER EATON. COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
04:01:04.592: >> Councilmember Ackerman: DOES SOMEONE HAVE THEIR WINDOW OPEN AND LIVE NEAR A BIRD SANCTUARY? DOES ANYONE ELSE HEAR LIKE BIRDS CHIRPING OR AM I GOING IN INSANE? THE -- SO THE -- I DO WANT TO TURN MY ATTENTION TO THE $700,000 IN LAST REVENUE AND STAFF GIVES THE COMMUNICATION ON WHAT THE IMPACT OF THAT IS -- REGARDLESS OF -- REVIEWING THE WATER RATE STRUCTURE, WHICH I DON'T SUPPORT. I DO HAVE SOME APPETITE FOR LOOKING AT DELAYING THE RATE INCREASE IF IT'S -- IF IT'S TENABLE TO OUR LONG-TERM PLANS FOR OUR WATER SYSTEM WHICH IS IN NEED OF UPGRADE, JUST GIVEN THE SITUATION WE ARE IN AND THAT A LOST OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE UNEMPLOYED IN THE STATE OF MICHIGAN. WHAT IS THE IMPACT ON THE SYSTEM AND OUR PLANS FOR A SIX-MONTH DEFERRAL, IF ANY?
04:02:12.894: >> WELL, CRAIG HUPY, PUBLIC SERVICES AREA ADMINISTRATOR. WHEN YOU SAY THE IMPACT OF THE DEFERRAL, IF IT IS NEUTRAL ON REVENUE ULTIMATELY, WHAT IT WILL DO IS WE WILL HAVE TO HAVE A HIGHER RATE INCREASE IN JANUARY OF 2020T1 TO MAKE UP FOR THE LAST SIX MONTHS. SO IT WILL SET THE WATER RATE INCREMENTALLY HIGHER. IF YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT $700,000, WHAT IS THE IMPACT, THAT WOULD BE ONE MAJOR WATER PROJECT THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE DEFERRED. ZA>> Councilmember Ackerman: AND LIKELY THAT WOULD BE DEFERRED IN CALENDAR YEAR?
04:03:08.483: >> YES, BECAUSE WE WOULD HAVE TO MATCH UP REVENUE TO THE ACTUAL CONSTRUCTION.
04:03:13.087: >> Councilmember Ackerman: AND CAN YOU GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF A $700,000 PROJECT?
04:03:17.725: >> I'M GOING TO CALL ON MARTY, BUT AN EXAMPLE OF A PROJECT WE HAVE LOOKED AT SLOWING DOWN IS THE BROADWAY WATER MAIN REPLACEMENT OR STATE STREET WATER MAIN WORK. BUT I WOULD LET MARTY CONFIRM THE VALUE OF THOSE PROJECTED OR LYNN, WHOEVER WANTS TO JUMP IN. ZA>> Councilmember Ackerman: THANKS.
04:03:47.822: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE STAFF CONFIRMFIRMATION ON THAT POINT.
04:03:51.659: >> YES, THE BROADWAY WATER MAIN REPLACEMENT IS JUST IN EXCESS OF $1 MILLION, WHEREAS THE STATE STREET IS ABOUT $663,000.
04:04:01.502: >> AND THE BROADWAY WATER MAIN WOULD ALSO -- DEFERRING THAT WILL DEFER THE ROAD PROJECT, BECAUSE THE ROAD -- THE ROAD PROJECT IS WAITING FOR THE WATER MAIN TO BE DONE.
04:04:14.082: >> Councilmember Ackerman: OKAY. AND THEN COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, I SAW YOU NODDING ALONG THAT IT -- WHEN MR. HUPY COMMENTED THAT WE WOULD INCREASE THE RATE TO A HIGHER AMOUNT IN JANUARY TO MAKE UP FOR THE LOST REVENUE. WAS THAT YOUR INTENTION AS WELL?
04:04:31.432: >> Councilmember Lumm: I THINK THAT WAS OBVIOUS.
04:04:34.102: >> Councilmember Ackerman: OKAY. I WAS JUST CONFIRMING.
04:04:36.471: >> Councilmember Lumm: I THINK THAT WAS A SOFTBALL, FRANKLY, RHETORICAL QUESTION.
04:04:41.275: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YEAH.
04:04:42.510: >> Councilmember Lumm: WE ARE DEFERRING IT AN AND -- RIGHT. I'M NOT TRYING TO NOT DISCLOSE THAT. I THINK IT'S AN OBVIOUS OUTCOME. ZACK I W>> Councilmember AckermI JUST WANTED TO MAKE -- I WAS JUST CLARIFYING.
04:05:00.895: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN, YOU STILL HAVE THE FLOOR. ZACK I'M>> Councilmember Ackerm I'M GOOD FOR NOW, BUT THAT WAS HELPFUL CONTEXT.
04:05:13.174: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
04:05:14.041: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  WE HAVE GONE ROUND AND ROUND ABOUT WATER RATES. I'M JUST A LITTLE TROUBLED BY THE FACT THAT IN DISCUSSING THIS AND THINKING OF POSTPONING IT TO JANUARY, THAT WE WOULD BE JEOPARDIZING PROJECTS THAT ARE SLATED FOR THIS YEAR. IT SEEMS THAT IT WE WERE TOLD THAT WE HAVE A PRETTY SIZABLE CASH RESERVE THAT WE ARE BUILDING UP IN ANTICIPATION -- I FIND IT TROUBLING THAT WE CAN'T CASH THESE CHECKS RIGHT NOW IF WE DON'T INCREASE THIS BY $700,000. IT SEEMS OUR FUND BALANCE SHOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF THINGS THAT WE CAN TAKE OF OUR POLICY MATTERS WITHOUT JEOPARDIZING CURRENT PROJECTS. IN THE FUNDAMENTAL SENSE, I HAVE BIG PROBLEMS WITH IT BECAUSE I DON'T BELIEVE THE FAIRNESS OF THAT TIERED SYSTEM. COULD YOU -- COULD SOMEBODY ON STAFF REAFFIRM THAT NOTION THAT WE ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE WATER MAIN PROJECTS GO FORWARD? I KNOW THAT WE JUST APPROVED ON STATE STREET -- YES, STATE STREET FOR NEXT YEAR AND BROADWAY IS A HOT MESS RIGHT NOW. IT'S TROUBLING TO ME THAT WE CAN'T DO THESE PROJECTS EVEN THOUGH WE ARE SITTING ON A SIZABLE CASH BALANCE.
04:06:53.841: >> I WILL START AND I WILL ASK MARTY TO JUMP IN, BUT WE ARE LOOKING AT WHERE WE END UP AT THE END OF THE SIX, EIGHT YEARS AS WE PROJECT FORWARD AND WE ARE BUILT -- AS YOU SAY, WE ARE BUILDING THE BALANCE UP. AND I DON'T KNOW RIGHT NOW HOW CLOSE WE ARE TO OUR BALANCE MINIMUMS GIVEN THE WET SUMMER WE HAD LAST YEAR WHICH SLOWED THE REVENUES. I'M WAITING FOR MARTY TO JUMP IN.
04:07:43.090: >> I AM GOING TO LET LYNN HANDLE THAT.
04:07:46.494: >> ALL RIGHT THANK YOU, MARTY.
04:07:48.029: >> YEP.
04:07:48.329: >> SURE. SO UNRESTRICTED FUND BALANCE WE HAVE, I WOULD SAY AT THE END OF FISCAL YEAR 2019, WE HAD ABOUT $11 MILLION. AND THEN FINANCIAL POLICIES DICTATE THAT WE NEED SO MUCH IN OPERATING RESERVES EACH YEAR. SO THE MATH ON THE FLY IS AROUND 5 TO $6 MILLION THAT WE ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE, BUT THE LONG-TERM FINANCIAL PLAN IS THAT WE BUILD UP ENOUGH CASH SO WE CAN BOTH CASH FINANCIAL CAPITAL PROJECTS AND DEBT FINANCE THEM. WE ARE OBLIGATED TO CASH FUND A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF OUR CAPITAL INVESTMENTS AND SO GOING INTO THESE REALLY, REALLY LARGE PROJECTS THAT'S WHAT WE ARE BUILDING UP OUR FUND BALANCE AND CASH FOR. SO DOES THAT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION SUFFICIENTLY?
04:08:45.252: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  IT PUTS AIL LITTLE LIGHT ON THE DISCUSSION. WE ARE SITTING ON A CASH BALANCE OF TWO TIMES THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENT. IF WE ARE TALKING ABOUT $700,000, AND WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A SIX MONTH DELAY, THAT'S $350,000. SO I WOULD HOPE THAT IF THIS WAS, YOU YOU KNOW, APPROVED THAE WOULD STILL GO FORWARD WITH THE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS AND THAT THEY ARE NOT GOING TO BE JEOPARDIZED AS WE CONTINUE TO DISCUSS THE WATER RATES IN THE TIERED -- IT'S.
04:09:23.190: >> IT'S NOT ONLY THE WATER RATES THAT'S JEOPARDIZING THE CAPITAL PROJECTS. ALSO UNDERSTAND IN THE RECOVERY PLANS WE HAD WATER MAIN PROJECTS SITTING THERE. CAPITAL PROJECTS SITTING THERE. THE USAGE DOESN'T COME BACK UP, THE REVENUES DON'T COME BACK UP, THEY WILL ALSO BE ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK. WOULD WANT IT KNOWN THAT IT'S ONLY WATER RATES JEOPARDIZING THE CAPITAL PROJECTS. IT'S THE DECREASED USE THAT'S THREATENING CAPITAL PROJECTS RIGHT FOUL.
04:10:01.062: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: WHICH LENDS MORE -- RIGHT NOW.
04:10:03.764: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: WHICH SENDS MORE WEIGHT TO MY ARGUMENT. I THINK UNFORTUNATELY, PEOPLE DON'T LIKE TO HEAR THIS, BUT THE PEOPLE USING ONE THROUGH 18, YOU KNOW, NEED TO PAY MORE. WE HAVE A SYSTEM BASED ON VOLUME AND IF WE ARE GOING TO BE WORKING TOWARDS OUR, CARBON NEUTRALITY GOALS WE WILL WATCH HOW MUCH WALTER WE USE AND IF WE LOOK AT THE SCIENCE AND INCREASED PARTICIPATION IN MICHIGAN, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 43% INCREASE IN PRECIPITATION. SO I'M NOT A BIG FAN OF THE CURRENT SYSTEM AND THAT'S NO SECRET.
04:10:49.310: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
04:10:51.245: >> Councilmember Hayner: WE'RE SPEAKING TO THIS AMENDMENT RIGHT NOW?
04:11:00.187: >> Mayor Taylor: CORRECT.
04:11:00.754: >> Councilmember Hayner:  IT GOT A LITTLE IN THE WEEDS. MY COMMENT WILL PIGGYBACK ON WHAT COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI SAID. I DON'T WANT TO SEE -- BROADWAY RESURFACING PROJECT IS -- I GUESS COULD BE CONSIDERED LONG OVERDUE, IT'S A WRECK AND WE KNOW ABOUT ALL THE WATER ISSUES AT THE TOP OF THE HILL AND I WOULD HATE TO SEE THIS RESOLUTION KICK THE BROADWAY PROJECT TO THE CURB. IT'S SO GUESS. I'M SURE THAT YOU MORE THAN ANYONE KNOWS HOW IMPORTANT THIS REPLACEMENT IS. THAT'S ALL. WE HAVE SERIOUS WATER PROBLEMS UP THERE. I HOPE IT DOESN'T DELAY THE BROADWAY RESURFACING AND THE WATER MAIN PROJECT. IT'S IN TERRIBLE CONDITION, THE TREAT STREET AND THE PIPES. THANK YOU.
04:11:54.308: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? I'M SORRY. COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
04:11:58.179: >> Councilmember Bannister:  I WANTED TO TAG ON TO WHAT MR. HUPY SAID, THAT BROADWAY WATER MAIN AND RESURFACING IS ALREADY ON THE -- IN TROUBLE ON THEIR PREVIOUS PRESENTATION ON MAY 4 BECAUSE OF THE RECOVERY PLAN AND IT'S ONE OF THE THREATENED CAPITAL PROJECTS NOT BECAUSE OF THIS NEW WATER RATE AMENDMENT BUT IT WAS ALREADY THREATENED, IF I UNDERSTOOD CORRECTLY FROM THE PREVIOUS PRESENTATION. WAS THAT WHAT YOU WERE TRYING TO SAY MR. HUPY TOO, THAT THE BROADWAY WATER MAIN AND RESURFACING WAS GOING TO BE JEOPARDIZED AND THREATENED IRREGARDLESS OF THIS AMENDMENT?
04:12:49.129: >> THE RECOVERY PLAN THAT WAS PRESENTED ON MAY 11th PRESUMED THE RATE INCREASE IN PLACE AND ROADWAY AS ONE OF THE POTENTIAL PROJECTS THAT MIGHT BE DELAYED TO MATCH EXPENDITURES TO REVENUES. I'M SORRY, I SAW COUNCILWOMAN GRISWOLD DROP OUT AND THEN HAVE HER HAND RAISED IN THE ATTENDEE SECTION, BUT I DON'T SEE HER ANYMORE.
04:13:27.134: >> Mayor Taylor: I DON'T SEE HER EITHER. CAN STAFF TAKE -- WANT TO TAKE A BREAK AND SEE IF WE CAN GET HER BACK ON? ANYBODY HAVE ANY OBJECTION TO THAT?
04:13:40.114: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THAT SEEMS FAIR BEFORE A VOTE.
04:13:43.150: >> Clerk Beaudry: SHE'S BACK, MAYOR. SHE'S BACK. COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER?
04:13:59.066: >> Mayor Taylor: GRISWOLD.
04:14:00.067: >> Clerk Beaudry: OH.
04:14:00.567: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN. LET'S TAKE A SHORT BREAK AND IF STAFF COULD REACH OUT TO COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER -- PARDON ME GRISWOLD AND FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON. IT'S 11:14. LET'S RECONVENE AT 11:25. [ BREAK ]
04:27:14.893: >> Mayor Taylor: WE'RE BACK AFTER A SHORT BREAK. I FORGET WHO HAD THE FLOOR. MR. CRAWFORD DO YOU I HAVE IN INFORMATION FOR US? -- DO YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION FOR US?
04:27:28.875: >> City Admin. Crawford: YES, COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, I SENT YOU AN EMAIL. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAD A CHANCE TO SPEAK TO THAT.
04:27:39.252: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES, IT'S HELPFUL. I SUBMITTED THIS AMENDMENT TO EVERYONE LAST WEEK, INCLUDING STAFF. I SENT IT TO STAFF FIRST, OF COURSE, BUT DURING THE BREAK, I RECEIVED A NOTE FROM MR. CRAWFORD INDICATING I NEEDED TO AMEND THIS RESOLUTION. SO MR. CRAWFORD.
04:28:02.475: >> City Admin. Crawford: THIS IS A FORM OVER SUBSTANCE, MY OLOGIES. I THINK THIS CAME -- MY APOLOGIES. I THINK THIS CAME IN AND WE THOUGHT IT WAS A BUDGET SETTING AMENDMENT. AND THIS IS A RATE SETTING AMENDMENT. AND THE APPROPRIATE FORUM TO FULFILL WHAT COUNCILMEMBER LUMM WAS TRYING TO DO, INSTEAD OF HAVING A RESOLVE CLAUSE IS TO AMEND THE -- TO AMEND THE ORDINANCE BEFORE YOU AND TO AMEND IT TO -- AND I WOULD SAY CHANGE THE EFFECTIVE DATE FROM 7/1 TO DECEMBER 31st AND ADD WORDING THAT INDICATES -- IT CHANGES AND ADJUSTS THE RATE INCREASE AT 12/31 TO MAKE IT EFFECTIVE 7/1. I BELIEVE THAT DOES THE SAME THING THAT COUNCILMEMBER LUMM IS TRYING TO DO, AND IT DOES IT IN ORDINANCE FORMAT RATHER THAN RESOLUTION.
04:28:59.666: >> Mayor Taylor: DOES THAT MOVE US TO A SECOND READING AT OUR NEXT MEETING MR. POSTEMA?
04:29:04.804: >> City Atty. Postema: I'M LOOKING AT THAT RIGHT NOW. THE DELAY OF THE DATE, I THINK WOULD NOT IN AND OF ITSELF DO THAT. IN THE END, IT'S COVERING A YEAR TIME PERIOD. THIT IS A CHANGE. IT IS A SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE. WITH YOU DO HAVE TIME TO DO IT FOR SECOND READING. I DON'T THINK IT NEEDS TO BE DONE TONIGHT. I'M STILL LOOKING AT THIS. I SHOULD SAY, I'M HAVING MR. WILHELM LOOK AT IT. SO --
04:29:54.120: >> Mayor Taylor: YES, COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
04:29:56.122: >> Councilmember Lumm: THIS COMES AS A COMPLETE NEWS FLASH TO ME.
04:29:59.259: >> Mayor Taylor: I THINK WE ALL UNDERSTAND THAT.
04:30:01.894: >> Councilmember Lumm: I SENT IT TO STAFF ON THURSDAY AND ASKED FOR, YOU KNOW, FEEDBACK. AND I DID MAKE IT CLEAR AS I REITERATED TO EVERYONE ON COUNCIL THAT THIS WOULD BE INTRODUCED AS I INTRODUCED IT TONIGHT AS AN AMENDMENT. TO THIS AGENDA ITEM B-3. BUT IT WAS NOT -- I HEARD NOW IT WAS INTERPRETED AS A BUDGET AMENDMENT. IF THAT HAD BEEN THE CASE, IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DISTRIBUTED IT. WASN'T. I DID -- I MET ALL THE DEADLINES.
04:30:43.736: >> Mayor Taylor: I THINK WE ALL UNDERSTAND THAT YOU GOT THIS OUT IN ADVANCE OF IT BEING -- OF IT BEING SUITABLE FOR CONSIDERATION. WHAT WAS NOT --
04:30:51.544: >> City Admin. Crawford: IT'S A STAFF ISSUE.
04:30:53.079: >> Mayor Taylor: THIS IS ACTUALLY A IT'S NOT A BUDGET MEMBER --
04:31:01.154: >> City Admin. Crawford: IT WAS A STAFF OVERSIGHT.
04:31:04.557: >> Mayor Taylor: YEAH. I THINK EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS THAT AND SO WE ARE NOW DETERMINING WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS A -- WE ARE DETERMINING WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH ALTERATION TO WARRANT A SECOND READING. IS IT ALL RIGHT WITH THE BODY AND I GUESS I WOULD REQUIRE UNANIMITY ON THIS TO WASH OUT THE RESOLUTION -- THE SOLUTION STYLE AMENDMENT SUGGESTED BY -- OR PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM AND INSTEAD GO WITH THE LANGUAGE RECOMMENDED BY MR. CRAWFORD TO AMEND THE ORDINANCE THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE UP FOR THE AGENDA? IS THAT OKAY?
04:31:59.979: >> Clerk Beaudry: DOES EVERYONE -- DOES EVERYONE HAVE IT OR DO YOU WANT ME TO FORWARD IT?
04:32:05.084: >> Mayor Taylor: I BELIEVE MR. CRAWFORD HAS DISTRIBUTED IT TO EVERYONE.
04:32:08.421: >> Councilmember Ackerman: CAN WE DO IT AS ONE READING.
04:32:11.290: >> City Admin. Crawford: I HAVE NOT DISTRIBUTED.
04:32:13.192: >> Mayor Taylor: MY APOLOGIES.
04:32:14.927: >> City Admin. Crawford: I WAS TRYING TO REACH COUNCILMEMBER LUMM OVER THE BREAK.
04:32:19.866: >> Mayor Taylor: YEP.
04:32:20.366: >> City Admin. Crawford: AND TO MONTH OF THIS ALONG MORE EFFICIENTLY, IT WOULD HONESTLY BE HELPFUL IF I HAD A FEW MINUTES WITH HER ON A BREAK.
04:32:35.281: >> Mayor Taylor: DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY OBJECTION TO THE -- TO US WALKING OFF OF THIS ISSUE AND PUTTING IT TO THE END OF THE MEETING? THIS WOULD.
04:32:51.030: >> Councilmember Eaton: I THINK THIS --
04:32:52.365: >> Councilmember Lumm: I DON'T KNOW WHAT I CAN DISCUSS THIS YOU MR. CRAWFORD. I GOT THIS FIVE MINUTES AGO BEFORE WE RESUMED. AND THERE WAS NO TIME TO DISCUSS IT. I POPPED OUT OF MY SEAT AND I'M LOOKING AT THE EMAIL.
04:33:09.982: >> City Admin. Crawford: I'M SORRY. I WAS NOT BEING CRITICAL.
04:33:13.653: >> Mayor Taylor: UNDERSTANDING THAT WE ARE NOT IN A SITUATION WHERE WE ARE GLAD TO BE. IT'S 11:30 NOW. I THINK IT WOULD SURPRISE A LOT OF US IF WE DIDN'T HAVE ANOTHER HOUR OR TWO OF REGULAR DISCUSSION TO BE HAD. LET'S IF WE CAN -- AND I THINK COUNCILMEMBER EATON MADE THE RIGHT CALL. LET'S TABLE THIS ISSUE. AND THEN AT THE END OF THE MEETING, WE'LL EITHER TAKE A BREAK IN THE ORDER COURSE OR PERHAPPED AT THAT POINT WE'LL TAKE A BREAK AND THEN ALLOW COUNCILMEMBER -- PERHAPS AT THAT POINT WE'LL ATAKE A BREAK AND THEN ALLOW COUNCILMEMBER LUMM AND MR. CRAWFORD WORK THROUGH WHAT THEY NEED TO DO AND PULL THIS UP ON THE BACK END.
04:33:51.591: >> Councilmember Lumm: CAN I OFFER ANOTHER ALTERNATIVE?
04:33:57.964: >> Mayor Taylor: PLEASE.
04:33:58.498: >> Councilmember Lumm: THAT WE TABLE IT -- I THINK REALISTICALLY -- I DON'T KNOW HOW WE WILL FRANKLY DISCUSS THIS, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE A LONG MEETING HELD OF US COME WE TABLE THIS TO JUNE 1st.
04:34:15.248: >> Mayor Taylor: WE CAN TABLE IT AND BRING IT BACK ON JUNE 1st. IS THAT ALL RIGHT WITH STAFF? LET'S HAVE THAT POSTPONEMENT, PERHAPS.
04:34:24.390: >> Councilmember Lumm: I APPRECIATE YOUR ACKNOWLEDGING IT. I CROSSED ALL THE Ts AND DOTTED ALL THE Is.
04:34:30.429: >> City Admin. Crawford: YOU DID. THIS IS OVERSIGHT ON MY PART.
04:34:33.165: >> Mayor Taylor: MAY I HAVE A MOTION TO POSTPONE THIS TO FIRST MEETING IN JUNE.
04:34:38.037: >> Councilmember Eaton: I WOULD MOVE.
04:34:40.840: >> Mayor Taylor: LUMM, GRISWOLD, POSTPONEMENT TO THE FIRST MEETING IN JUNE. ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT IS POSTPONED. B-4. AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND SECTION 2:69 OF CHAPTER 29 (STORMWATER RATES) OF TITLE II OF THE CODE OF THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. MOVED BY COUNCIL MEMBER SMITH AND SECONDED BY ACKERMAN. DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] ALL OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. B-5, AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND SECTION 9:42 OF CHAPTER 107 (ANIMALS) OF THE CODE OF THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER DID COUN, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER. DISCUSSION OF B-5?
04:35:40.633: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANKS I'M HAPPY TO SEE THIS MOVE FORWARD. SOMEONE HAD CONCERNS OVER DUCKS BECAUSE WE ADDED DUCKS TO THIS. WE KNOW THAT DUCKS EXIST IN THE CITY ALREADY AND MAYBE SOME OF US KNOW PEOPLE WOULD OWN THEM. I THINK THAT THE CONCERNS THAT WERE PUT FORWARD BY THE RESIDENT MAY VERY WELL BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE ADDRESSED THROUGH ANOTHER MEANS LIKE A VIOLATION OF A NOISE ORDINANCE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. I'M NOT CERTAIN OF THAT. AND SO I JUST WANTED TO BRING THAT UP AND PUT IT OUT THERE THAT WE HAD ONE -- I RECEIVED A NOTIFICATION FROM SOMEBODY WHO SAID THEY WEREN'T SO THRILLED WITH THIS BECAUSE THEY LIVE NEXT DOOR TO DUCKS APPARENTLY AND APPARENTLY THEY ARE LOUD. AND NOT HAVING HAD DUCKS MYSELF, I DON'T KNOW. I HAD A CARPENTER WHO KEPT CHICKENS. HE HAD ONE DUCK AND IT DIDN'T SEEM EXTRAORDINARILY LOUD, BUT MAYBE A FLOCK IS A DIFFERENT SITUATION. THAT'S THE ONLY COMPLAINT I HEARD. EVERYBODY ELSE IS -- I HAVE HEARD FROM A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO SAY THEY ARE HAPPY WITH THIS AND HAPPY MOVING FORWARD AND THEY THINK IT MOVES FORWARD ON OUR RESILIENCE GOALS ALSO FOR PEOPLE TO BE RESPONSIBLE KEEPERS OF GAME HERE IN THE CITY. I'M GLAD YOU SUPPORT IT LAST TIME AND I ENCOURAGE YOU TO SUPPORT IT AGAIN. LIKE I SAY, JUST PASSING THAT CONCERN FORWARD. AGAIN, I THINK THIS -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE WOULD DO IF SOMEBODY HAD A FLOCK OF DUCKS AND THEY WERE A NEIGHBORHOOD NUISANCE. I WOULD ASSUME THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WOULD GO THROUGH COMMUNITY STAND HARDARDS AND NOS ORDINANCE.
04:37:16.562: >> City Atty. Postema: IT COULD BE. IT'S AN ENFORCEMENT ISSUE. MR. DELACOURT CAN TALK TO IT, BUT WE HAVE HAD NUISANCE ISSUES AND THAT WAS THE CONCERN, WHEN DUCKS WERE ADDED. AND NOW THEY ARE LUMPED TO GO AND AS I UNDERSTAND IT. AND SO IT -- IT -- YOU ARE ASKING THAT THEY DID THAT PEOPLE BE PERMITTED TO DO SOMETHING THAT MAY, IN FACT, CAUSE AN ENFORCEMENT ISSUE AND DUCKS ARE DIFFERENT THAN CHICKENS. THAT'S JUST IT.
04:37:51.263: >> Councilmember Hayner:  IT'S KIND OF ON US WHERE WE MAY BE CREATING A SITUATION WHERE THERE'S MORE ENFORCEMENT NECESSARY THAN TYPICALLY. I'M NOT CERTAIN OF THAT. THAT'S WHAT WAS PUT FORWARD. I'M STILL PERFECTLY WILLING TO SUPPORT THIS. I THINK IT'S GREAT. FOR ANYBODY WHO IS INTO CHICKENS, YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT THE CHICKEN SHIPPING IS OUT PAST JULY AND AUGUST. THAT'S HOW MUCH INTEREST THERE IS NATIONALLY FROM THE NINE DIFFERENT PLACES, EVERYONE IS OUT THROUGH THE END OF JULY AND AUGUST ALREADY FOR SHIPPING. SO IT'S A HOT TOPIC NATIONWIDE RIGHT NOW, AND PROBABLY RIGHTLY SO.
04:38:33.239: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
04:38:34.240: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT HAS BEEN PUT INTO THIS. I HAVE HAD SOME CONSTITUENTS RAISE SOME CONCERNS. I KNOW MY COLLEAGUE COUNCILMEMBER NELSON HAS REACHED OUT TO ME TO EXPLAIN AND EASE SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT MY PRESRESIDENTS FOURTH WARD HAVE N INCREASING THE NUMBER OF CHICKENS AT A TIME OF A PANDEMIC AND IT RAISED THEIR SENSE OF CONCERN. WHETHER IT'S BASED IN SCIENCE OR NOT, IT'S THEIR REALITY. THIS DOES LUMP THE DUCKS WITH THE CHICKENS AND I DON'T KNOW IF I WOULD GO AS FAR TO SUPPORT THIS BECAUSE IT DOES INCLUDE SIX DUCKS, AND THAT'S JUST I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WAS OUR INTENT. IT GIVES ME CONCERN FOR BECAUSE AND I WILL RESERVE MUST TIME.
04:39:49.849: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
04:39:52.251: >> MIC CHECK.
04:39:54.386: >> Councilmember Bannister: UNRELATED QUESTION. THAT WAS A REQUEST ONE FROM THE DUCKS. I RECEIVES A QUESTION FROM A RESIDENT. THEY WERE ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT IT, HOWEVER, THEY WERE WORRIED THAT IF A NEIGHBOR DOG RECENTS ONE OF THE DUCKS IS THERE A -- DUCKS EATS ONE OF THE DUCKS OR CHICKENS IS THERE AN ISSUE? SHOULD -- DO WE NEED ANYTHING TO PROTECT DOG OWNERS FROM POTENTIAL LIABILITY?
04:40:31.857: >> City Atty. Postema: THIS IS PRIMARILY AN ISSUE OF PEOPLE HAVING TO TAKE -- WE HAVE HAD ISSUES WHERE DOGS HAVE JUMPED OVER A FENCE AND DESTROYED CHICKENS. THAT'S PRIMARILY ON THE DOG OWNER. IF THE CHICKENS WANDERED INTO ANOTHER YARD, THAT MAY BE ANOTHER PROBLEM, BUT THOSE ARE SOMETHING THAT THE NEIGHBORS WOULD HAVE TO SORT OUT. AS FAR AS THE CITY CREATING LIABILITY, NO. THE CITY IS NOT LIABLE FOR ANY OF THAT.
04:41:03.355: >> Councilmember Bannister: THANK YOU.
04:41:07.192: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER NELSON -- I'M SORRY, MS. BEAUDRY.
04:41:13.265: >> Clerk Beaudry: IF I COULD CLARIFY, THIS AMENDMENT DOES NOT INCREASE IT TO SIX BIRDS. IT ELIMINATES THE REQUIREMENT FOR THE NEIGHBORS TO SIGN OFF, AND THE DUCKS ARE ALREADY IN THE ORDINANCE. THIS IS JUST THE REMOVAL OF THE NEIGHBOR WAIVER.
04:41:33.419: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER NELSON, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
04:41:34.920: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I FEEL THAT THIS WERE SOME STATISTICS ON THIS OR I HEARD ANECDOTALLY ABOUT THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF DUCK PERMITS THAT HAVE BEEN ISSUED IN THE CITY. MAYBE JACKIE WERE YOU TELLING ME SOMETHING ABOUT THIS. I FEEL LIKE THAT THE ORDINANCE WAS ONLY FAIRLY RECENTLY EXPANDED TO INCLUDE DUCKS AND -- DID I JUST DREAM THAT? DID I IMAGINE THAT? JACKIE, DID YOU TELL ME THAT THERE WERE NO -- NO ONE HAS YET PULLEDED A PERMIT FOR DUCKS?
04:42:07.619: >> Clerk Beaudry: YES, I BELIEVE ALL THE PERMITS ARE FOR CHICKENS AND I THINK IT WAS -- IF MY MEMORY SERVES WE CORRECTLY FORMER COUNCILMEMBER WARPEHOSKI PROPOSED THE AMENDMENT TO INCLUDE THE DUCKS. SO THAT IS CURRENTLY IN THE ORDINANCE.
04:42:24.536: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I GUESS I WOULD POINT OUT THAT DUCKS ARE A LOT MORE INVOLVED. YOU NEED WATER SOURCE FOR THEM. I'M NOT SURPRISES THAT THERE HAVE NOT BEEN PERMITS PULLED FOR DUCKS BECAUSE DUCKS ARE STRICTIER. THERE IS NOT MUCH CONCERN OVER THIS TOPIC. AND THERE'S CONCERN WITH NEIGHBORHOOD. AND I GUESS WE MIGHT HAVE BROUGHT THIS UP AT FIRST READING, REALLY IT'S NOT A HAZARD AT ALL. YOU JUST WASH YOUR HANDS. SO FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
04:43:28.667: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: SORRY. LOSING PEOPLE HERE. SO THERE HAS BEEN ONE OTHER ISSUE THAT HAS BEEN BROUGHT UP REGARDING THIS SOME PEOPLE ARE ADVERSE TO CONFRONTATION AND THEY DON'T LIKE CONFRONTATION, AND THIS MAYBE SETS UP NEIGHBORS TO BE PUT IN AN UNCOMFORTABLE POSITION WHEN THE NEIGHBOR DOESN'T APPROVE OF ANOTHER NEIGHBOR'S CHICKENS OR DUCKS. IT COULD SET UP -- I'M JUST PUTTING THIS OUT THERE BECAUSE IT'S IN THE EMAIL THAT I DID RECEIVE WHERE PEOPLE FELT IF A NEIGHBOR DID NOT GIVE PERMISSION THAT IT WOULD -- AND I GUESS THAT LENDS ITSELF TO EVEN MORE REASON TO GET RID OF THE REQUIREMENT. I'M THINKING THIS OUT AND TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T DO SOMETHING AND HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES WITH THIS. SO I GUESS I WILL QUICK DRAW. WE HAVE A LONG MEETING.
04:44:35.367: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
04:44:36.502: >> Councilmember Hayner:  TWO QUICK QUESTIONS THAT I'M NOT SURE WHO WILL ANSWER. NUMBER ONE TO SPEAK TO THE AVIAN FLU ISSUE BECAUSE BIRDS HERE IN THE STATE OF MICHIGAN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT. IF WE RECEIVED AN AVIAN FLU THING, W AND THEY WOULD HAVE TO DESTROY THEM, WHO WOULD ENFORCE THAT? THE STATE OR THE CITY? THAT'S MY FIRST QUESTION. SECOND QUESTION, AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND IN THE A2ZERO, THERE'S MENTION OF USING PUBLIC LANDS FOR PUBLIC GARDEN AND PUBLIC FARMING, AND SO ON. WOULD WE NEED TO MODIFY THIS TO AHOWALLOW THESE BIRDS TO BE ON PUBLIC LAND. I DON'T THINK THIS PROHIBITS US FROM PASSING THIS TONIGHT, I WANT TO HANG IT OUT THERE FOR SOMEBODY.
04:45:35.827: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION?
04:45:37.629: >> City Atty. Postema: COUNCILME ENFORCEMENT, WHETHER THAT WOULD COME FROM THE STATE BACK TO COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI'S QUESTION ABOUT THE DUCKS, AS FAR AS THE HISTORY, COUNCILMEMBER WARPEHOSKI DID SPONSOR THIS. THE DISCUSSION, AS I RECALL, BECAUSE OF THE NEIGHBOR NOTICE WAS SIGNIFICANT, WAS REALLY THE SIGNIFICANT REASON WHY IT WAS ALLOWED GIVEN THAT THE NOISE WAS DIFFERENT. THE QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT IF A HOUSE IS SURROUNDED BY DUCKS AND THE CITY ALLOWS IT, WHETHER THERE WOULD BE A CAUSE OF ACTION FOR NUISANCE, I WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT THAT. YOU AS COUNCILMEMBERS WOULD CERTAINLY HEAR ABOUT IT. MY ONLY POINT BEING, IT MAY CREATE AN ISSUE. I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S BEEN ANY DUCKS BUT THAT WAS THE REASON THE NEIGHBOR CONSENT WAS RUN OF THE REASONS FOR THE EXTENSION TO DUCKS.
04:46:49.668: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE PLEASE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
04:47:00.479: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  NO.
04:47:03.782: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES.
04:47:07.586: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES.
04:47:09.688: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES.
04:47:16.695: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES.
04:47:17.796: >> Councilmember Grand: YES.
04:47:18.397: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES.
04:47:25.037: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
04:47:25.837: >> Councilmember Eaton: YES.
04:47:26.438: >> Councilmember Nelson:  YES.
04:47:32.978: >> Councilmember Smith: YES.
04:47:33.578: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: -- SORRY. MOTION CARRIES.
04:47:41.486: >> Mayor Taylor: DC-1 RESOLUTION TO APPOINT GEOFFREY PERKINS TO THE BUILDING BOARD OF APPEALS AND THE DESIGN REVIEW BOARD, CHRISTIANA ALLEN-PIPKIN TO THE COMMISSION ON DISABILITY ISSUES AND DIANA CASS TO THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRAND, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER SMITH. DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] ALL OPPOSED? WITH 11 COUNCILMEMBERS PRESENT, ALL VOTING IN THE AFFIRMATIVE, THE SEVEN VOTE REQUIREMENT IS MET. DC-2, RESOLUTION TO REAPPOINT STEFANIE STAUFFER TO THE GREENBELT -- OH, THAT'S BEEN WITHDRAWN MY APOLOGIES. DC-3, RESOLUTION TO APPOINT RITA MITCHELL TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION. MOVED BY BANNISTER AND SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER SMITH. DISCUSSION, PLEASE, OF DC-3. ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] ALL OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. DC-4 RESOLUTION TO REAPPOINT ROBERT NEEDHAM AND KARIE SLAVIK TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER SMITH, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER. DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR?

MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, DISCUSSION? CALL IN FAVOR. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED?

DISCUSSION OF DC-7, COUNCILMEMBER EATON? I'M SORRY, I HAVE COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER IN THE QUEUE. QUICK ON THE TRIGGER TONIGHT.
04:49:32.931: >> Councilmember Hayner: YEAH, SORRY. JACK, DO YOU WANT TO GO FIRST? IT'S YOUR -- OKAY. I KNOW THIS IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT WE MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE A GOOD THING. IF YOU SAW THE BERNIE BUMPER STICKERS ON MY CAR, YOU WOULD KNOW WHY I BELIEVE THAT. I THINK THIS THAT, YOU KNOW, WE MAKE THE RIGHT MOVES AS WE COME OUT OF THIS PANDEMIC. IT HAS CERTAINLY ILLUSTRATED NOW MORE THAN EVER THAT HEALTHCARE IS IF IT'S NOT A HUMAN RIGHT, IT'S ABOUT AS CLOSE AS GETTING TO IT WITHOUT BEING IT. I HOPE WE CAN SUPPORT IT.
04:50:20.045: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
04:50:20.979: >> Councilmember Eaton: I WAS CONTACTED BY A LOCAL GROUP ASKING ME TO SPONSOR THIS RESOLUTION I WAS HAPPY TO DO SO. IT BOTH SUPPORTS THE FEDERAL LEGISLATION AS WELL AS THE STATE LEGISLATION THAT WAS SUPPORTED BY OUR STATE REPRESENTATIVE, JOSEF RABI. I DON'T KNOW THAT WE COULD HAVE A GREATER NEED FOR UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE AND THE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC. WHEN PEOPLE NEED THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE MOST, THEY ARE LOSING THEIR JOBS AND LOSING THEIR HEALTH INSURANCES. I HOPE YOU ALL SUPPORT IT.
04:51:02.554: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
04:51:03.455: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. AND THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER EATON FOR BRINGING THIS FORTH AND JOSEF RABI FOR ALL THE WORK THAT HE DOES IN LANSING. I ASKED TO BE A COSPONSOR AND, YOU KNOW, I WILL MAKE A STATEMENT HERE, IT IT'S MY STRONG BELIEVE THAT HEALTHCARE IS A BASIC HUMAN RIGHT IN WHICH THE UNITED STATES IS THE ONLY INDUSTRIALIZED NATION IN THE WORLD NOT TO ADOPT A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM. WHICH HAS RESULTED IN GROSS INEQUITIES IN OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM, INCREASED HIGHER INFANT MORTALITY RATE, LATELY OUR LIFE EXPECTANCY IS RATES IN THE US ARE ON THE DECLINE. WE HAD MILLIONS OF AMERICANS FILE BANKRUPTCY OVER HEALTHCARE COSTS. IT'S OBVIOUS WE HAVE A BROKEN SYSTEM. WE SPEND TWICE AS MUCH ON OUR GDP ON HEALTHCARE AS OUR NEIGHBORS TO THE NORTH. RIGHT NOW AS WE SEE WITH COVID-19, IT REALLY SETS A MOTION IN A CLUSTER MESS OF COMPETING INTERESTS AND POLICIES' WE TRY TO GO REOPEN THE ECONOMY NOW. AND THE WAY THAT BEN IF IS ARE TIED WITH -- BENEFITS ARE TIED WITH EMPLOYMENT AND PEOPLE ARE LOSING JOBS AND HEALTH CARE, IT'S A MISHMASH OF INTEREST THAT ARE NOT SERVING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THEY ARE SERVING THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY AND THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY. SO I CAN GO ON AND ON ABOUT THIS, BUT I THINK OTHER PEOPLE CAN SAY IT BETTER THAN ME. LIKE OUR PUBLIC SPEAKER SAID EARLIER, THIS IS A NO-BRAINER. I'M GLAD TO BE A COSPONSOR. THANK YOU.
04:53:11.583: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
04:53:12.784: >> Councilmember Lumm: ON THAT NOTE, THANK YOU. THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. WHEREVER I VOTE AGAINST SOMETHING ANOTHER COUNCILMEMBER BRINGS FORWARD, I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO SAY WHY. SO BRIEFLY, LEER IT IS. LIKE MANY -- HERE IT IS. LIKE MANY POLITICIANS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE, I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE MASSIVE COST OF THE PROGRAM, AND HOW IT WOULD BE PAID FOR. I ALSO HAVE REAL PROBLEMS WITH FORCING INDIVIDUALS TO GIVE UP THE PRIVATE AND EMPLOYER PLANS THAT THEY NOW HAVE. PLANS THAT MANY OF THE FOLKS -- THOSE FOLKS REALLY DO LIKE AND DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO ABANDON. I DO UNDERSTAND THAT MANY FOLKS SUPPORT MEDICARE FOR ALL, BUT I THINK THERE ARE LEGITIMATE CONCERNS AND GOOD REASONED WHY THE U.S. HOUSE AND SENATE HAVE NOT PROVED FOR THE ON THE SINGLE MAYER MEDICARE FOR ALL BILLS SINCE THEY WERE INTRODUCED A YEAR AGO. I'M, BUT I CANNOT SUPPORT THIS.
04:54:17.749: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND?
04:54:22.087: >> Councilmember Grand: I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT, THIS ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THE STATE PIECE WITH REPRESENTATIVE RABI. I DO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THERE ARE INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES THAT DON'T HAVE SINGER PAYER SYSTEMS. THEY HAVE HYBRID SYSTEMS WITH PUBLIC OPTIONS BUT THAT'S -- THAT'S MORE ACADEMIC THAN ANYTHING ELSE. I'M PLEASED TO SUPPORT IT.
04:54:54.486: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
04:54:55.353: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: PERHAPS IT'S ACADEMIC BUT I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE A SYSTEM THAT'S IN PLACE THAT COVERS ALL OF OUR INDIVIDUALS. I THINK ALL THE OTHER INDUSTRIALIZED NATIONS NEED THAT. IF WE WANT TO GO AHEAD AND BUY A CADCADILLAC POLICY AND PAY $500A MONTH TO JUMP THE LINE AND SEE A DIFFERENT DOCTOR, GO FOR IT, BUT THERE NEEDS TO BE A BASELINE THAT WE ARE ALL COVERED. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR.
04:55:26.284: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
04:55:35.026: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES.
04:55:38.129: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES.
04:55:41.399: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES AND I HAD MY HAND UP. I WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED AS AI COSPONSOR.
04:55:49.073: >> Clerk Beaudry: GOT IT. THANK YOU.
04:55:51.009: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES.
04:55:58.850: >> Councilmember Lumm: NO.
04:56:00.351: >> Councilmember Grand: YES.
04:56:00.952: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES.
04:56:04.489: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
04:56:05.490: >> Councilmember Eaton: YES.
04:56:06.090: >> Councilmember Nelson:  YES.
04:56:11.563: >> Councilmember Smith: YES.
04:56:12.163: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION CARRIES.
04:56:15.567: >> Mayor Taylor: IT RETROSPECT, I WOULD LIKE TO MENTION THAT DC-5 WAS PASSED WITH 11 MEMBERS BEING PRESENT THUS SATISFYING THE SEVEN VOTE REQUIREMENT. AND MOVING ON TO DC-8. RESOLUTION REGARDING FY21 BUDGET AND FINANCIAL RECOVERY PLAN. MOVED BY LUMM AND SECONDED BY GRISWOLD. DISCUSSION OF DC-8. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
04:56:41.593: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU TO COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD FOR BEING A COSPONSOR. I SENT THE AMENDMENT TO ALL OF YOU. IT'S IN THE LAST BULLET IN THE THIRD RESOLVE CLAUSE AND IT REPLACES IT WITH SECOND WITH PRIOR-BASED BUDGETS.
04:57:02.747: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE A SECOND TO THE AMENDMENT? IS THAT FRIENDLY? COUNCILMEMBER LUMM YOU STILL HAVE THE FLOOR.
04:57:08.620: >> Councilmember Lumm: THIS WAS A GOOD SUGGESTION FROM COUNCILMEMBER NELSON THAT I CERTAINLY CONSIDER FRIENDLY AND I APPRECIATE PRETTYING IT AS WELL. THERE IS NOT TIME FOR ME TO GO THROUGH EACH LEA LINE IN THIS BI WANT TO GO THROUGH IT ACCOMPLISHED. THE FISCAL '21 BUDGET WILL BE SET AND WE HAVE A BUDGET PROPOSAL BEFORE US THAT GOVERN NO FAULTOF STAFF IS OUTDATED BEF COVID-19 AND EXCESS OF THE REVENUES WE NOW EXPECT. WE KNOW THE SIGNIFICANT COST REDUCTION ACTIONS WILL BE REQUIRES AND MR. CRAWFORD PRESENTED A RECOVERY FRAMEWORK ON MAY 11th FOR US TO CONSIDER. THE RECOVERY FRAMEWORK CONTEMPLATES COST-SAVING ACTIONS. WE'RE NOT JUST TALKING TRIMMING THE BUDGET HERE AND THERE THESE ARE SERIOUS SUBSTANTIVE ACTIONS THAT LIKELY WILL BE NECESSARY. GIVEN THAT, IT'S ALL TOGETHER APPROPRIATE FOR COUNCIL TO PROVIDE POLICY LEVEL DIRECTION THROUGH THE FINANCIAL CRISIS AND THAT'S WHAT THIS RESOLUTION DOES. IN FACT, IT'S NOT JUST A PROGRAM, IT'S COUNCIL'S FUNDAMENTAL RON SUAREZ JOB TO PROVIDE POLICY DIRECTIONS IN TIMES LIKE THIS. POLICY DIRECTION WOULD BE HELPFUL, BUT THAT THERE MUST BE FLEXIBILITY THIS RESOLUTION HAS BOTH. THE POLICY DIRECTION TAKES THE FORM OF GENERALLY ENDORSING THE RECOVERY PLAN PRESENTED BY MR. CRAWFORD AND AFFIRMING ITS NECESSITY AND PROVIDING GUIDING PRINCIPLES AND EXPECTATIONS INCLUDING FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY, CHAIRED SACRIFICE AND COUNCIL AND SENIOR LEADERSHIP TAKING THE LEAD IN THAT SACRIFICE. THE NECESSARY FLEXIBILITY IS PROVIDED IN TWO PAYS. FIRST IT'S EXPLICITLY COVERED IN A SECOND TO LAST RESOLVE CLAUSE AND BY REMOVING THE COUNTY MILLAGE PROCEEDS. AND REGARDING THAT PARTICULAR ITEM, CONTRARY TO THE PUBLIC IMPRESSION THAT'S BEEN CREATED THAT RESOLVE CLAUSE DOESN'T DEFUND ANYTHING OR ANY A MONEY AWAY FROM ANYONE. RATHER IT SAYS WE WILL TREAT THOSE DOLLARS EXACTLY THE SAME AS WE DO FOR ALL OTHER UNRESTRICTED TAX DOLLARS. IF IN A GIVEN YEAR, THERE'S A NEED FOR ADDITIONAL MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES, OR FOR MORE AFOR THIBLE HOUSING, OR A NEED TO AVOID LAYING OFF EMPLOYEES, THE CITY NEEDS THE FLEXIBILITY TO DO THAT. I WOULD LIKE TO WATCH THROU THE RATIONAL FOR THE SPECIFIC ITEMS. I'M OPEN TO SUGGESTIONS AND AMENDMENTS. I HOPE THAT WE WILL ALL AGREE THAT IN THIS SITUATION WHEN COUNCIL IS APPROVING A BUDGET, ARGUABLY ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS WE DO AND WHEN WE ARE ABOUT TO NAVIGATE ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL CRISIS THE CITY HAS FACED, THAT POLICY DIRECTION FROM COUNCIL IS BOTH APPROPRIATE AND NECESSARY. THANK YOU FOR LISTENING FOR YOUR CONSIDER.
05:00:37.161: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU FURTHER DISCUSSION. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
05:00:39.664: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER LUMM FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD, AND HAVING THE COURAGE TO BRING IT UP. I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF AMENDMENTS I WOULD LIKE TO PROPOSE. I SENT THEM TO MS. BEAUDRY TODAY. I THEY THE ONE THAT WAS TIME STAMPED 7:32 IS THE ONE ON THE RESOLVE CLAUSE, THE LAST ONE, WHERE IT'S ASKING FOR AT LEAST MONTHLY REPORTS I BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT IT'S ASKING FOR. I WOULD LIKE TO CHANGE THAT TO QUARTERLY. I THINK JUST MONTHLY IS ASKING FOR A LOT AND TAKING A LOT OF TIME THAT COULD BE PUT ELSEWHERE.
05:01:29.347: >> Mayor Taylor: I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT. IS THERE A SECOND ON THAT? IS THERE A SECOND ON THAT AMENDMENT? SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, MY APOLOGIES.
05:01:38.122: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: SORRY TO RUN ON THERE. SO ANYHOW, I JUST FEEL LIKE IF WE HAVE THE CONFIDENCE THAT I THINK WE HAVE IN OUR CITY ADMINISTRATOR AND OUR STAFF THAT WE CAN GIVE THEM THE GUIDANCE AND THEN MAYBE ASK FOR QUARTERLY REPORTS RATHER THAN MONTHLY, I JUST FEEL LIKE THAT'S A LITTLE TOO CUMBERSOME.
05:01:59.977: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THAT FRIENDLY TO THE BODY?
05:02:03.281: >> Councilmember Lumm: IF I MAY?
05:02:05.116: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCIL MEMBER LUMM.
05:02:06.217: >> Councilmember Lumm: I DID DISCUSS THAT PARTICULAR -- THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE AND REQUEST WITH MR. CRAWFORD. HE CAN CERTAINLY SPEAK TO THIS NOW. I'M FLEXIBLE TO GO ANY WHICH WAY ON THIS. MR. CRAWFORD DID INDICATE THAT HE WAS COMFORTABLE WITH PROVIDING MONTHLY UPDATES YEAH, I DON'T WANT IT TO BE CUMBERSOME, BUT HE INDICATED THAT THAT WAS NOT A PROBLEM. MR. CRAWFORD?
05:02:36.047: >> City Admin. Crawford: YES, I CAN ACCOMMODATE EITHER. IF YOU DO AMEND IT TO QUARTERLY. IF I HAD SOMETHING TO BRING TO YOU BEFORE THAT, I WOULD JUST BRING IT. I'M OKAY WITH QUARTERLY AND YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT I WON'T WAIT IF THERE'S SOMETHING I NEED TO TELL YOU.
05:02:53.030: >> Mayor Taylor: QUARTERLY FRIENDLY TO THE BODY? I'M DEA DEEMING QUARTERLY TO BE FRIENDLY. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, YOU STILL HAVE THE FLOOR.
05:03:03.341: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  AND THEN I HAVE ANOTHER ADDITIONAL RESOLVE CLAUSE THAT WOULD MAKE IT THE SEVENTH, AND THIS SPEAKS TO MORE OF SHARED SACRIFICES THAT COUNCILMEMBER LUMM TALKED ABOUT EARLIER. I KNOW EARLY ON WITHOUT EVEN BEING SUGGESTED, I BELIEVE OUR CITY ADMINISTRATOR HAS TAKEN A VOLUNTARY 10% PAY CUT. IS THAT CORRECT? SORRY TO PUT YOU ON THE SPOT.
05:03:32.169: >> City Admin. Crawford: NONE OF THE PAY CUTS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED FOR SENIOR MANAGEMENT HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED YET. ALL OF THOSE ITEMS ON THAT LIST ARE ITEMS THAT WE WOULD USE TO GET TO WHERE WE NEED TO BE IN THAT SCENARIO, BUT AS WE STARTED WORKING ON THAT LIST REALLY JUST RECENTLY, NONE OF THOSE NOTHING ON THAT LIST IS EXECUTED YET.
05:03:55.459: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THE LEAD ON THAT. I HEARD YOU DISCUSSING IN ONE OF OUR WORK SESSIONS AND APOLOGIZE FOR PUTTING YOU ON THE SPOT. I BELIEVE THAT COUNCIL IS DUE FOR A SUBSTANTIAL, I THINK 38% PAY INCREASE IN THE NEXT YEAR, THE NEXT FISCAL YAO E YEAR, ANDI THINK THIS WOULD BE A GOOD TIME TO TAKE ON THE SHARED SACRIFICE THAT WE ARE ASKING OTHERS TO TAKE AND THAT IS A 10% REDUCTION IN COMPENSATION FOR ALL COUNCILMEMBERS EFFECTIVE IF FISCAL YEAR '21, AND THAT EFFECTIVELY PAYS FOR ONE OF OUR POSITIONS.
05:04:38.302: >> City Atty. Postema: COUNCILM?
05:04:41.138: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. POSTEMA.
05:04:41.806: >> City Atty. Postema: COUNCIL CANNOT REDUCE ITS OWN PAY. IT CAN ONLY BE DONE THROUGH THE PROCESS. YOU DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO CUT YOUR OWN PAY IN THAT REGARD. CERTAINLY THERE ARE OPTIONS --
05:04:52.016: >> Mayor Taylor: IF I MAY INTERRUPT THIS WAS ON ISSUE BACK DURING GREAT RECESSION AND WE RECEIVED THE ADVICE THAT WE WERE UNABLE TO REDUCE OUR OWN SALARIES. HOWEVER, THERE WAS A VOLUNTARY RETURN OF SALARY TO THE CITY IN ACCORDANCE WITH WHATEVER PERCENTAGE THE INDIVIDUAL COUNCILMEMBERS THOUGHT APPROPRIATE.
05:05:15.439: >> City Atty. Postema: THAT'S CORRECT.
05:05:18.876: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  ALL RIGHT, WELL, BASED ON THAT INFORMATION, I WILL WITHDRAW THAT AMENDMENT.
05:05:23.481: >> Mayor Taylor: ALL RIGHT. I HAVE COUNCIL MEMBER EATON AND LUMM IN THE QUEUE.
05:05:27.718: >> Councilmember Eaton: THANK YOU. I HAVE SENT AN AMENDMENT TO THE CITY CLERK. I'M WONDERING WHETHER IT GOT THROUGH THIS TIME. SO I WOULD LIKE TO OFFER THE SIMPLE AMENDMENT. IN THE THIRD RESOLVE CLAUSE IN THE THIRD BULLET POINT, I WOULD LIKE TO STRIKE THE SECOND SENTENCE REGARDING SEEKING PAY CONCESSIONS FROM REPRESENTATIVE EMPLOYEES. ANN ARBOR IS AN EXPENSIVE CITY, I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD ASK RANK AND FILE EMPLOYEES TO REDUCE THEIR PAY. FIRST, IT WON'T AMOUNT TO AS MUCH AS WE NEED, BUT SECONDLY, I THINK PEOPLE THAT COVERED BY A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT SHOULD BE PROTECTED FROM THIS WAWAVE OF CUTS. IF THERE'S ANOTHER NEED TO CUT BACK, I WOULD TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT IT, BUT I DON'T THINK THAT WE SHOULD TRY TO INVADE THOSE EXISTING COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS TO SEEK CONCESSIONS. IS THERE A SECOND?
05:06:39.156: >> Mayor Taylor: SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN. WE HAVE COUNCILMEMBER LUMM AND THEN -- I WILL CLEAR THE QUEUE. HOLD ON FOR A SECOND.
05:06:48.933: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR.
05:06:53.571: >> Mayor Taylor: I HAVE LUMM AND HAYNER.
05:06:55.639: >> Councilmember Lumm: I ACCEPT THIS AS FRIENDLY AND I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY, THOUGH, THAT AS WORDED, REPRESENTATIVE EMPLOYEES ARE ASKED TO SHARE IN SACRIFICE CONSISTENT WITH NON-REPRESENTED EMPLOYEES. THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT, BUT JUST THAT THEY WOULD BE ASKED. I SENT COUNCILMEMBER EATON'S SUGGESTION.
05:07:38.549: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
05:07:39.416: >> Councilmember Hayner:  IT'S SORT OF AN ASK. I APPRECIATE WHERE IT'S COMING FROM. DO WE EVEN HAVE -- WE DON'T REALLY HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO INTERVENE IN ALREADY AGREED UPON CONTRACTS DO WE? I MEAN WE COULDN'T ASK THEM WE COULDN'T ASK UNION EMPLOYEES FOR A PAY CUT, COULD WE?
05:08:02.540: >> City Admin. Crawford: DURING THE LAST DOWN DOWNTURN, WE DID T TO EMPLOYEES AND ASK, ACTUALLY THE FIRE UNION WAS VERY HELPFUL IN THAT REGARD IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY. YOU CAN ASK. YOU KNOW, BUT YOU ARE ASKING FOR SOMETHING THAT IS VOLUNTARY, RIGHT. I MEAN, THEY HAVE TO BE WILLING TO DO IS IT.
05:08:34.138: >> Councilmember Hayner:  AND CAN QUESTION ASK FOR OTHER THINGS? THEY HAVE TO BE WILLING TO DO IT.
05:08:42.146: >> Councilmember Hayner: OKAY. JUST CURIOUS. WE HAD THIS CONVERSATIONS IN THE PAST WHERE OUR PENSION MANDATES AND SO ON ARE GOING TO TAKE A HIT. IF WE ARE GOING TO ASK FOR ANYTHING, I WOULD ASK FOR CHANGES IN THE VESTING PERIODS AND SO ON, AND THERE'S LOTS OF THINGS I THINK I COULD ASK FOR.
05:09:10.341: >> City Admin. Crawford: ONE OF THE BENEFITS IS THAT LOCKING IN A CONTRACT, BOTH PARTIES PEN FIT FROM THAT STABILITY. IT'S NOT AN EASY THING TO GO BACK AND ASK AND IT SHOULD NOT BE LOOKED AS UNFAVORABLE ON ANY OUTCOME THERE. NECESSARILY. THERE'S AN EXPECTATION THAT YOU MEET YOUR COMMITMENTS WHEN YOU SIGN A CONTRACT.
05:09:32.596: >> Councilmember Hayner: SURE. I MEAN -- I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE QUESTION, BUT MR. CON CRAWFORD, DO YOU SEE THT YOU CAN ACT IN A MANNER THAT IS APPROPRIATE TO SAFEGUARD THE CITY?
05:09:49.613: >> City Admin. Crawford: I'M -- IN THE AMENDED RESOLUTION, AS AMENDED?
05:09:53.050: >> Councilmember Hayner: SURE. DID THAT NOT COME ACROSS? SURE.
05:10:05.129: >> City Admin. Crawford: I'M LOOKING AT IT.
05:10:06.096: >> Councilmember Hayner: THAT'S THE ESSENCE. I THINK WE ARE SPEAKING TO JACK'S AMENDMENT NOW, RIGHT?
05:10:11.101: >> Mayor Taylor: YEAH.
05:10:11.602: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WILL OLD MY QUESTION AND GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO LOOK IT OVER AGAIN, MR. CRAW.
05:10:20.477: >> City Admin. Crawford: SO TO CLARIFY IN THE AMENDED LANGUAGE, IS IT -- IS IT PROHIBITED -- ARE YOU INDICATING THAT YOU DON'T WANT US TO TALK TO AS A POLICY -- TALK TO THE UNITS WE COLLECTIVELY BARGAINED WITH AND ONLY WORK WITH SALARIES?
05:10:41.031: >> Councilmember Eaton: THAT'S THE PREFERENCE THAT IMEXPRESSING NOW, YES.
05:10:44.401: >> City Admin. Crawford: YES SO THAT IS A LIMITATION ON THE ABILITY TO SOLVE THE FINANCIAL PROBLEM. RIGHT? SO --
05:10:53.043: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU.
05:10:57.314: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
05:10:58.382: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES, I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING THIS AMENDMENT. I THINK THAT WE NEED FLEXIBILITY AND TALKING TO THE BARGAINING UNITS AND GIVING THEM THE OPTION OF HOW TO ACHIEVE SOME SAVING TARGETS BE IT THROUGH STAFFING REDUCTIONS OR THROUGH DAY DECREASES OR ANY OTHER CREATIVE WAY AND THAT'S I'M MOST FAMILIAR WITH IN THE BUSINESS WORLD TO GIVE THE BARGAINING UNIT LEADERSHIP FLEXIBILITY TO MEET TARGETS IN WHATEVER WAY IS REASONABLE TO THEM.
05:11:42.593: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. CRAWFORD.
05:11:43.227: >> City Admin. Crawford: PRIOR TO PRESENTING YOU WITH THE FINANCIAL RECOVERY PLAN, I MET -- I MET JUST TO INFORM THE UNION LATE LEADERSHIP, IT WASN'N ASK ABOUT WHERE WE ARE. I BELIEVE WE ARE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THIS ORGANIZATION WITH ALL OF OUR EMPLOYEES AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO COMMUNICATE THE PROBLEMS WE HAVE. AND THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS WITH DIFFERENT GROUPS. GOING FORWARD, I CAN TELL YOU THAT MY YOU KNOW, I INTEND TO WORK WITH ALL THE EMPLOYEES BOTH BY COMMUNICATION AND MUTUAL SOLVING ISSUES OF.
05:12:35.179: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. RAMLAWI.
05:12:35.813: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: DOES IT GIVE YOU PAUSE IN THE THIRD BULLET POINT. IS IT GOING TO BE DIFFICULT TO WORK ON THE UNIONS WITH SHARED SACRIFICE IF IT HAS TO COME DOWN TO THAT? I KNOW THAT I JUST -- I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE EQUITY HERE AMONGST THE ORGANIZATION AND TO, YOU KNOW EXCLUDE A GROUP JUST DOESN'T SEEM AS EQUITABLE AND I HOPE IT DOESN'T COME DOWN TO THIS, BUT IF IT DID, WHAT ARE THESE ORGANIZATIONS FEEL LIKE IT WAS IN THEIR OWN SELF-INTEREST TO MAKE THOSE SACRIFICES AND IT WOULD BE BEST FOR GREATER GOOD?
05:13:33.270: >> City Admin. Crawford: IT WOULD BE A DIALOGUE AND WE CAN TALK TO EACH OTHER. I DON'T REALLY HAVE MUCH I CAN OFFER OTHER THAN TO YOUR COMMENT THAT, YES IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE A LOT MORE WORK THAT WE HAD NOT PLANNED ON. WE DON'T TYPICALLY TALK TO ALL OF THE EMPLOYEE GROUPS AT THE SAME TIME, BUT YOU KNOW, IN TIMES LIKE THIS, WE COULD ENGAGE IN THAT CONVERSATION AND SEE WHAT COMES OUT OF IT.
05:13:59.029: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  CAN I ASK YOU ONE MORE FOLLOW-UP. WHAT HAPPENED IN THE LAST GREAT RECESSION WHEN WE WERE ALREADY CONTRACTS AND HOW DO WE SHIFT THE 300 FULL-TIME POSITIONS IN SUCH A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME WITH WHAT WAS USED?
05:14:18.849: >> City Admin. Crawford: IT WENT OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS AND THERE WERE A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT WERE DONE. THERE WAS AN EARLY RETIREMENT INCENTIVE. THERE WAS PAY CUTS WERE ELIMINATED FOR FIVE YEARS. IT WAS A LONG TIME. IT WAS VERY TOUGH. WE HAD PAY REDUCTIONS I BELIEVE IN FIRE IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY. I WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK AND LOOK AT THE DETAILS.
05:14:46.944: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: OKAY THANK YOU.
05:14:49.613: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
05:14:50.580: >> Councilmember Nelson:  AS I LISTEN TO EVERYBODY ELSE'S COMMENTS ABOUT EQUITY AND FAIRNESS, I ITS TO ME THAT ISN'T IT GENERALLY TRUE THAT THE EMPLOYEES THAT WOULD BE REPRESENTED ARE AT LOWER PAY SCALES? I GUESS I'M INCLINED TO SUPPORT COUNCILMEMBER EATON'S AMENDMENT ONLY BECAUSE IT STRIKES ME AS POTENTIALLY REGRESSIVE IF WE ARE DEMANDING THAT EVERYBODY SACRIFICE ACROSS THE BOARD REGARDLESS OF WHAT PAY SCALE YOU ARE AT. AND TO THE EXTENT THAT BEING REPRESENTED BY A UNION -- I'M GUESSING THAT THOSE EMPLOYEES WOULD BE AT A LOWER PAY SCALE THAN SALARIED EMPLOYEES. AM I RIGHT ABOUT THAT? IS THAT GENERALLY TRUE?
05:15:39.863: >> City Admin. Crawford: IT IS -- WE DO HAVE EMPLOYEES ON BOTH SALARIES AND NONSALARIED THAT ARE ON THE LOWER PAY SCALE, THE LOWER END OF THE PAY SCALE.
05:15:48.372: >> Councilmember Nelson: OKAY. AT ANYAT ANY RATE, I HAVE A PHILOSOPHICAL PROBLEM. THAT'S KIND OF THE POINT OF WHY THESE REPRESENTATIVE AGREEMENTS EXIST. THANKS.
05:16:21.405: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
05:16:27.511: >> Councilmember Grand: I THINK THIS ISSUE SPEAKS TO AN ISSUE I HAVE MORE BROADLY WITH THE ENTIRE RESOLUTION, THERE ARE A LOT OF UNINTENDED. -- POTENTIAL UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF US TYING THE HANDS OF THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR AND LEADERSHIP STAFF BY MAKING THESE CHOICES NOW. I THINK WE HAD A REALLY GOOD DISCUSSION A WEEK AGO, IN FIRST RESOLVE CLAUSE. THE FACT THAT WE ARE HAVING TO HASH THESE OUT ONE BY ONE BEFORE WE HAVE EVEN GOTTEN TO THE BUDGET AT 12:17, I THINK SPEAKS TO A REAL PROBLEM AND WHY THERE WAS A LOT OF CONCERN IN THE COMMUNITY TODAY OVER THIS. BECAUSE I DON'T THINK IT'S BEEN FULLY THOUGHT THROUGH WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES ARE AND I WOULD PREFER IN THIS TIME FOR US TO BE MORE NIMBLE AS AN ORGANIZATION AND TO GIVE MR. CRAWFORD AND HIS STAFF THE ABILITY TO WORK WITH AS FEW RESTRICTIONS AS POSSIBLE AND COME BACK WHEN THESE DIFFICULT DECISIONS ARE BEING MADE BUT I THINK IT'S -- I HEAR ALL THE TIME ABOUT NOT HAVING ACCESS TO INFORMATION. IF WE DON'T KNOW EVERYTHING, I THINK IT'S PREMATURE TO DICTATE A LOT OF THESE POLICIES NOW.
05:17:59.736: >> Councilmember Lumm: WE ARE SPEAKING TO THE AMENDMENT, RIGHT?
05:18:05.308: >> Mayor Taylor: THE AMENDMENT.
05:18:06.743: >> Councilmember Lumm: I WILL HOLD OFF THEN.
05:18:08.044: >> Mayor Taylor: FOR MY PART, I'M GOING TO VOTE AGAINST THE AMENDMENT. I THINK IT IS UNWISE TO -- TO SET UP THESE BARRIERS BETWEEN AND AMO AMONGST CITY EMPLOYEES. I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE ISSUES OF EQUITY AND ABILITY TO -- THE ABILITY TO BEAR A PAY CUT AND I BELIEVE THOSE ISSUES WILL BE ABLY -- THAT THOSE IMPORTANT INTERESTS WILL BE DEFENDED BY MR. CRAWFORD AND MORE IMPORTANTLY BY THE MEMBERS OF THE BARGAINING UNIT. NO BARGAINING UNIT IS GOING TO ACCEPT A PAY CUT THAT IT DOES NOT WISH TO ACCEPT. THEY ARE NOT GOING TO ACCEPT AN AMENDMENT TO THE CONTRACT THAT THEY DO NOT VOTE ON AND WHICH THEY DO NOT APPROVE. IT SEEMS WE ARE STOPPING THE ADMINISTRATOR FROM ASKING THE QUESTION, AND EXPLORING WHETHER THEY ARE WORK CONDITIONS THAT COULD PERHAPS BE GIVEN IN EXCHANGE FOR PAY RAISES TO THE SIDE OR OTHER FINANCIAL BENEFITS. I THINK THAT THE QUESTION OF FLEXIBILITY IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. WE INTO ED TO GIVE THE ADMINISTRATOR THE TOOLS TO DO WHAT WE CAN AND I HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT HE WILL NOT BALANCE THE BOOKS ON THE BACK OF OUR LOWER PAID EMPLOYEES AND I HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE BARGAINING UNITS THAT THEY WILL ABLY DEFEND THE INTERESTS OF THEIR MEMBERS. FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE AMENDMENT? ROLL CALL VOTE ON THE AMENDMENT, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
05:19:58.888: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  NO.
05:20:03.193: >> Councilmember Hayner:  NO.
05:20:09.599: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES.
05:20:12.335: >> Councilmember Griswold: NO.
05:20:21.144: >> Councilmember Lumm: NO.
05:20:23.513: >> Councilmember Grand: NO.
05:20:24.114: >> Councilmember Ackerman: NO.
05:20:30.720: >> Mayor Taylor: NO.
05:20:31.488: >> Councilmember Eaton: YES.
05:20:34.557: >> Councilmember Nelson:  YES.
05:20:41.431: >> Councilmember Smith: NO.
05:20:42.132: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION FAILS.
05:20:43.633: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN MOTION? I HAD LUMM AND THEN HAYNER IN THE QUEUE.
05:20:52.809: >> Councilmember Lumm: I WILL WAIT -- I WILL PASS.
05:20:55.979: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
05:20:56.880: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I'M LOOKING SIDEWAYS AND I HAVE IT ON A BIGGER SCREEN SO I CAN REFER TO IT. I LIKE MOST OF WHAT'S IN HERE. I KNOW IT CREATES SOME PROBLEMS IN THE INTERPRETATION OF IT. I DID QUESTION THE NOTION THAT WE -- WERE WE ARE ABLE TO TAKE A LEAD IN COMPENSATION, CITY COUNCIL, AND I GUESS THAT'S BEEN RESOLVED FOR US AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT VOLUNTARILY. I HAD A CONVERSATION WITH MY WIFE ABOUT IT TODAY AND, YOU KNOW, CAN I TAKE A HIT. I'M NOT WORKING. SHE'S WORKING PART-TIME NOW. IT'S ALL RIGHT. WE HAVE TO LEAD ON THESE THINGS. YOU KNOW, IN SOME WAYS, I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT DO MORE BUT AS COUNCILMEMBER GRAND POINTED OUT, WE DON'T WANT TO TIE PEOPLE'S HANDS. THE MORE OPPORTUNITY I CAN GIVE FOR MR. CRAWFORD AND HIS FINANCIAL WIZARDRY TO GO TO WORK WITH US. I DON'T SEE THIS AS TYING THEM DOWN. I THINK THE THING I SPEND A LOT OF TIME POINTING OUT TO PEOPLE WAS THAT THE END OF THE THIRD RESOLVE CLAUSE, IT'S TO SUPPORT THOSE MOST IMPACTED BY THE CRISIS. I BELIEVE AS A BODY, WE HAVE INDICATED AND AFFIRMED THAT WE BELIEVE THAT ESSENTIAL SERVICES INCLUDE THINGS LIKE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND SOCIAL SERVICES AND SUPPORT FOR THOSE WHO HAVE THE LEAST AMONG US IN THE COMMUNITY. I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE THE ASSUMPTION THAT THAT LINE COVERS THAT. OBVIOUSLY THERE'S NO GUARANTEES OF THAT. I WANT TO PUT THAT OUT THERE, WHEN WE GOT THAT WHEN I FINALLY GOT A COPY OF THAT ONE EMAIL, I CALLED OVER AND TALKED TO THE DIRECTOR AND WE HAD A CONVERSATION, AND THEY ARE REALLY IN NEED. I MEAN THEY ARE KICKING OUT FOUR TIMES THE GROW GROCERIES THAN TY DID A MONTH AGO. AS SOMEBODY WHO IN THE PAST HAS USED THOSE RESOURCES IN TOUGH TIMES, I APPRECIATE THE NEED FOR THOSE TYPES OF PROGRAMS. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE CUTTING WHERE CUTS CAN BE AFFORDED AND WITH TAKE THAT LINE SERIOUSLY. THE -- I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T HAVE BIG PROBLEMS WITH THIS. IT'S A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF GUIDANCE FOR OUR ADMINISTRATOR AND THE ADMINISTRATOR WILL DO THE BEST THAT HE CAN WITH THE SITUATION THAT WE ARE GOING TO FIND OURSELVES IN. AND I KNOW IT'S EASIER NOW TO MAKE CHANGES TO THE BUDGET, THAN VOTES THAT REQUIRE EIGHT VOTES. BUDGET ADDING OR SUBTRACT MONEY IT STILL REQUIRES EIGHT VOTES, AM. I CORRECT? OKAY. I SEE SOME HEAD NODS. THE PRIORITY BASED BUDGETING, I THINK THIS IS -- I THINK THIS IS APPROPRIATE AND I REALLY DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT. I KNOW THERE'S SOME HEARTBURN OVER THE 40/40/20 PROMISE. THOSE ARE GENERAL FUND DOLLAR AND THEY ARE NOT BEING TAKEN OUT OF THE BUDGET AS PRESENTED. I MEAN, ON THE OTHER SCREEN, I HAVE BEEN PORING THROUGH IT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT IS THE CASE. I THANK THE COUNCILMEMBERS FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND I THINK IT'S PERFECTLY APPROPRIATE AND I'M GOING TO SUPPORT IT.
05:24:53.983: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
05:24:54.851: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU FOR THE EXPLANATION. I WANT TO AGAIN REINSTATE THAT WE ARE NOT DEFUNDING OUR SOCIAL PROGRAMS LOCALLY. AND SORRY TO LOSE MY CALL EARLIER. IT'S BEEN AN EMOTIONALLY CHARGED DAY WHEN THAT IS BEING QUESTIONED AND SORRY. IT HURTS, BUT THAT'S NOT THE KIND I LIKE TO TAKE BECAUSE IT'S NOT TRUE. I HAVE NEVER BEEN A FAN OF 40/40/20. I HAD TO HAVE MANY CONVERSATIONS WITH CONSTITUENTS AROUND IT. THE FOLKS WHO SERVED BEFORE ME ON COUNCIL KNEW THE LIMITATIONS OF THAT RESOLUTION. THERE'S REASON WHY CERTAIN MILLAGES GO TO THE VOTER, OR ACTUALLY ALL OF THEM DO TO BE APPROVED SO THAT POLITICIANS LIKE OURSELVES WE CAN'T MOVE THOSE DOLLARS AROUND. IF IT'S FOR THE PARKS, IT GOES TO THE PARKS. IF IT'S FOR THE LIBRARY, IT GOES TO THE LIBRARY. IF IT GOES TO THE GREENBELT, IT GOES TO THE GREENBELT. SO, YOU KNOW, I -- I LIKE TO HOPE, THINK THAT AS ELECTED OFFICIALS WE WOULD EDUCATE OUR CONSTITUENTS AND EDUCATE THE GENERAL PUBLIC ON HOW WE ACTUALLY GO BA FUNDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR CLIMATE HOUSING OR PEDESTRIAN SAFETY WITH A DEDICATED MILLAGE, NOT BY A PROMISE. THAT'S FOOL HARDY TO THAT THAT'S A WAY TO HAVE  A DEDICATED FUNDING SOURCE. THE ONLY WAY IS THROUGH THE BALLOT AND THE LANGUAGE USED ON THAT BALLOT. SO IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT IT'S BEEN GAMED. HOPEFULLY WE ARE AT A POINT WHERE WE CAN PUT IT TO REST AND GIVE THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR THE SCHOOL AND THE FLEXIBILITY THAT WE NEED TO FACE THE CHALLENGES THAT ARE COMING. AND THIS DOES THAT. THIS CALLS A SPADE A SPADE. THIS MILLAGE MONEY IS GENERAL FUND DOLLARS AND IT SHOULD BE APPROVED BASED ON COUNCIL'S PRIORITIES. AND THAT'S ALL THIS IS DOING. THIS IS NOT DEFUNDING OUR NONPROFITS. THIS IS NOT DEFUNDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THIS IS NOT DEFUNDING CLIMATE ACTION. THIS IS GIVING US THE FLEXIBILITY TO MEET THE GROWING NEEDS OF OUR COMMUNITY. IN THE FUTURE MAYBE WE CAN COME BACK TO TALK ABOUT DEDICATED MILLAGE TO ADE DEFINE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND I WOULD LIKE TO LOOK AT THE GREEN BELT. I THINK THAT RIGHT THERE WITH 12 YEARS LEFT OR 10 YEARS LEFT, PERHAPS COULD UNLOCK SOME MILLAGE DOLLARS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WE SITTING ON AN $8 OR $9 MILLION FUND BALANCE AND WE HAVE BIGGER FISH. I THINK WE SHOULD TAKE THAT TO THE VOTERS AND SEE IF THEY WANT TO USE THAT MONEY FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING 20 YEARS LATER. I WILL LEAVE IT AT THAT.
05:28:55.391: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
05:28:56.259: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I JUST WANT TO COMMENT THAT IN SOME OF THE COMMUNITY I HAD WITH RES DEPENDS TODAY -- WELL, ACTUALLY IN ALL OF MY COMMUNICATIONS I WAS SHARING THE PRESENTATION FROM MR. CRAWFORD FROM OUR WORK SESSION, BECAUSE I THINK WE HAD A DISCONNECT OF HOW MUCH THE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDS THE LIKELY SHORTFALLS. SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT IS NOT UNDERSTOOD, I THINK WE HAVE TO SHOW SOME LEADERSHIP AND RESPOND TO THE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE THAT OTHERS DON'T. THE OTHER THING I WANTED TO SAY WAS SPEAKING TO A POINT THAT COUNCILMEMBER GRAND MADE THAT PERHAPS THIS WAS MOVING TOO QUICKLY BEFORE WE KNOW WHAT IS THE ON THE HORIZON, I'M CURIOUS, MR. CRAWFORD, IF THINGS WERE DIRE IN THE BUDGET. WE ARE LOOKING THAT 20% OF THIS REBATE IS GOING TO PEDESTRIAN SAFETY. WE COULD HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW THE LANDSCAPE FOR PEDESTRIAN SAFETY HAS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY RIGHT NOW AND I WOULD ARGUE THAT INVESTING IN A BIKE LANE IS A LOT LESS IMPORTANT TO ME RIGHT NOW THAN FEEDING SOMEBODY WHO IS HUNGRY OR MAKING SURE THAT SOMEBODY GETS TO STAY IN THEIR HOUSE BECAUSE THEY ARE ABOUT TO BE EVICTED. IF YOU WERE IN A POSITION, MR. CRAWFORD, WHERE THESE THIS POT OF MONEY WOULD GIVE A GOOD OPTION TO COVER SOMETHING IMPORTANT, IS THIS SOMETHING YOU COULD BRING TO US AND REMOVE THE 40/40/20? I'M CURIOUS -- WE ARE DOING OUR BUDGET TONIGHT AND IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO TAKE AWAY THESE RESTRICTIONS AND GIVE YOU MORE ROOM TO FIDDLE WITH THINGS. IS THIS AN OPPORTUNITY LATER FOR US TO SAY, OKAY, IT'S TIME TO FIDDLE WITH IT.
05:31:21.537: >> City Admin. Crawford: WELL, IT IS A COUNCIL POLICY AND YOU CAN DO THAT ANY TIME. I TAKE SERIOUSLY THE JOB TO WORK WITHIN BALANCED RESOURCES. SO DEPENDING HOW BAD THINGS GET, AND I REALLY -- IT'S JUST PURELY SPECULATIVE AT THIS POINT BUT DEPENDING ON HOW THINGS GET EVERYTHING COMES ON THE TABLE FOR ME TO BRING TO OPTIONS FOR YOU TO CONSIDER.
05:31:51.367: >> Councilmember Nelson: OKAY. I APPRECIATE THAT. AND I WANT TO REITERATE AGAIN. I HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH COUNCILMEMBER LUMM THIS WEEKEND, EXPRESSING MY CONCERNS THAT THIS WAS NOT THREE ENOUGH IN ARE MAYBE SOME IS SOMETHING WE NEED TO CLARIFY RIGHT NOW. I MEAN, TO ME, I -- I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE BULLET POINT FUNDING IS ENSURED FOR THE ACTIONS NECESSARY TO SUPPORT RESIDENTED MOST IMPACTED BY THE CRISIS, BUT BASED ON COMMUNITY TODAY, CLEARLY THAT IS NOT UNDERSTAND BY PEOPLE OR RECOGNIZED BY PEOPLE AS AN ACTUAL REFLECTION OF OUR VALUES. I DON'T KNOW HOW WE OVERCOME THAT THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING. I MEAN WE JUST HAD A CONVERSATION IN THE CONTEXT OF THE OTHER AMENDMENT ABOUT NOT WANTING TO TIE THE HANDS OF MR. CRAWFORD AND REALLY THE WAY I SEE THIS AMENDMENT, IT'S VERY MUCH ABOUT NOT TYING HIS HAPPENS. LOO LIKE HIS HANDS ARE UNNECESSY TIED FOR A REASON THAT IS OPTIONAL. I WILL STOP SPEAKING. I HAVE BEEN TALKING FOR A LONG TIME.
05:33:07.309: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
05:33:09.678: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. I DO THINK -- YOU KNOW, 50EN WE HEARD FROM DR. STULTS TODAY THAT THEY ARE HOOKING ACROSS THE ORGANIZATION TO MAKE CUTS AND THIS TO ME IS A NOT SO THINLY VEILED ATTEMPT TO GET RID OF 40/40/20 AND IT'S NOT -- IT'S CLEAR. AND NOW THIS TIME TO ME, MORE THAN EVER, THIS IS WHY WHEN THOSE OF US WHO WERE ON COUNCIL WHO SUPPORTED 40/40/20 AT THE TIME, MADE THAT PROMISE, IT WAS BECAUSE THIS IS ALL THE FUNDING THAT GETS CUT FOR THESE PRIORITIES, FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING, FOR CLIMATE ACTION, FOR PEDESTRIAN SAFETY, AND THIS WAS ALWAYS THE FUNDING THAT WAS SO DIFFICULT TO FINE, BUT YET WE WERE HEARING FROM THE COMMUNITY THESE ARE OUR PRIORITIES AND I THINK WE ALSO HEARD IT LOUD AND CLEAR TODAY FROM THE MESSAGES THAT WE RECEIVED. AND TOE ME, THIS IS W WHY THIS GETS HERE. I ALREADY HEARD FROM YOU, MAYBE PEDESTRIAN SAFETY BE GET CUT. IT'S IN THE B BUDGET, BUT EVERYTHING IS ON THE TABLE, THAT THAT'S NOT WHAT WE COME AFTER FIRST. SO I THINK THAT WAS -- THAT, IN PART, WAS THE INTENT OF THE POLICY TO HELP US DURING THESE TIMES TO SAY, THESE CONTINUE TO BE PRIORITIES AND WE'RE GOING TO PROTECT THIS AMOUNT. IT DOESN'T MEAN OTHER FUNDING FROM THE GENERAL FUND FOR THESE PROGRAMS DOESN'T GET CUT, BUT THIS MONEY STAYS. SO THAT AT A MINIMUM LEVEL, WE CAN CONTINUE TO FUND THESE IMPORTANT PROGRAMS. I ALSO THINK THE SECOND RESOLVE CLAUSE, WHILE I UNDERSTAND IT SESEEMS INNOCUOUS, ALSO COULD TE THE HANDS OF OUR CITY ADMINISTRATOR WHAT IF A CERTAIN PROJECT BECOMES LESS EXPENSE ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE WE ARE NOT COMPETING WITH OTHER COMMUNITIES FOR CONCRETE OR BECAUSE MONEY BECOMES REALLY NOW MAY BE THE TIME TO MOVE FORWARD WITH CERTAIN PROJECTS FOR OUR COMMUNITY. I DON'T WANT US TO LOSE THAT FLEXIBILITY. BUT IT SHOULD COME AS NO SURPRISE TO ANYONE THAT I WOULD NEVER SUPPORT ANYTHING THAT GETS RID OF 40/40/20 BECAUSE IT'S A PROMISE I MADE TO OUR VOTERS.
05:36:00.683: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I HAVE SUBMITTED AN AMENDMENT TO JACKIE, AND JACKIE, WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO SHARE THAT WITH COUNCILMEMBERS? AND WHILE YOU ARE DOING THAT, COULD I ASK THAT WE ENFORCE THE SPEAKING TIME LIMIT OF THREE MINUTES FOR COUNCILMEMBERS.
05:36:24.573: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
05:36:25.207: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WILL READ IT. IT'S VERY SHORT. IT SAYS RESOLVE THAT THE BASE LEVEL OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUNDING IS SET AT 40% OF THE MENTAL HEALTH MILLAGE FUND. THIS IS REALLY JUST A SYMBOLIC AMENDMENT BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO SPEND MUCH MORE THAN THAT GIVEN THE PANDEMIC AND THE FINANCIAL CRISIS THAT WE FIND OURSELFED SELVES IN, BUT IF THES CONCERN IN THE COMMUNITY AND CREATING ANXIETY AND STRESS, I WOULD RATHER ADD THIS OBVIOUS AMENDMENT TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS IN THE COMMUNITY.
05:37:09.952: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE  A SECOND. SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER EATON. COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD, YOU STILL HAVE THE FLOOR.
05:37:18.494: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I HAVE NO -- WELL, I GUESS ONE COMMENT WOULD BE I DON'T REALLY CARE IF IT'S 40% OF THE MENTAL HEALTH FUNDING MILLAGE OR AN ACTUAL DOLLAR AMOUNT, BUT I QUESTION WHETHER THAT DOLLAR AMOUNT MIGHT CHANGE CHANGE SLIGHTLY YEAR TO YEAR.
05:37:47.423: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
05:37:48.357: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT IT BE RESOLVED THAT THE BASE LEVEL OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING BE SET AT THE 40% OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY AND MENTAL HEALTH MILLAGE REBATE FUNDS OTHERWISE --
05:38:00.135: >> Councilmember Griswold: OKAY. THANKS. SO IT'S THE FORMAL TITLE.
05:38:04.606: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THE REBATE PIECE IS --
05:38:09.011: >> Councilmember Griswold: OKAY. JACKIE DO YOU MIND MAKING THAT?
05:38:12.548: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THAT FRIENDLY TO THE BODY? COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN YOU HAVE THE FLOOR STILL. ZACK I'M GOOD FOR NOW.
05:38:28.197: >> Councilmember Ackerman: I'M GOOD FOR NOW.
05:38:31.767: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
05:38:32.634: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I WANT TO THANK COUNCIL WOMAN GRISWOLD FOR BRINGING THIS UP. I THINK IT'S A COMMITMENT THAT WE WON'T HAVE A PROBLEM, AND IT WILL ALLEVIATE THE CONCERNS WE HAD TODAY. AND JUST REAL QUICK, WHETHER THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR HAS AN ISSUE WITH THIS AT ALL?
05:39:03.465: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
05:39:05.367: >> Councilmember Lumm: I WOULD ACCEPT IT AS FRIENDLY. I THINK THE FURTHER CLARIFICATION IS HELPFUL. CHATHANK YOU COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD. I WOULD SHARE THAT THE CITY HISTORICALLY, AND THIS  GOES ACROSS DECADES HAS PROVIDED MILLIONS IN GENERAL FUND FUNDING FOR NONPROFITS. NONPROFITS, LONG BEFORE40/40/20D CERTAINLY CONTINUE. AND SO THIS LANGUAGE DID REINFORCE WHAT'S BEEN THE PRACTICE FOR A VERY, VERY LONG TIME. SO THANK YOU COUNCIL WOMAN GRISWOLD.
05:39:57.820: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE AMENDMENT. COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
05:40:01.523: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THIS WOULD PRESERVE THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING PORTION OF 40/40/20 BUT WOULD STRIP POTENTIAL FUNDING FOR CLIMATE ACTION AND PEDESTRIAN SAFETY?
05:40:14.770: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD?
05:40:15.971: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I DON'T KNOW W IF THE WORD STRIP S ACCURATE. IT JUST WOULD NOT ADDRESS THOSE TWO IN THIS RESOLUTION. I THINK THAT WITH OUR A2ZERO PLAN, WE ARE ADDRESSING FUNDING FOR OUR CLIMATE ACTION AND WE HAVE QUITE AN AGGRESSIVE PEDESTRIAN SAFETY PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE HAD FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS AND I SUSPECT THAT WE WILL CONTINUE THAT WITHOUT CALLING IT OUT IN THAT RESOLUTION.
05:40:53.709: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
05:40:54.610: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I WOULD PUSH BACK ON THE WORDING STRIP. GIVEN ALL THE CONVERSATIONS AROUND CLIMATE CHANGE, WE ARE TALKING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT WE ARE GOING TO NEED, NOT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS. SO I THINK IT BECOMES PRETTY INSIGNIFICANT WHEN IT COMES TO CASH OP NEUTRALITY. I DON'T SEE OUR COMMITMENT AS WANING FROM THAT.
05:41:32.414: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
05:41:39.087: >> Councilmember Grand: BUT GIVEN THAT, THE MONEY WOULDN'T BE THERE I DON'T THINK IT'S SAFE.
05:41:50.198: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
05:41:51.099: >> Councilmember Lumm: IT PROVIDES FLEXIBILITY. THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES, IF THERE'S A NEED FOR IT TO BE USED TO AVOID LAYING OFF EMPLOYEES IT PROVIDED THAT KIND OF FLEXIBILITY.
05:42:12.588: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION?
05:42:16.725: >> Councilmember Lumm: IT'S FRIENDLY? IS THIS O ON THE MAIN MOTION?
05:42:25.801: >> Mayor Taylor: NO, THIS IS ON COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD'S MOTION. I FIND THIS PARTICULAR PROVISION IS INNOCUOUS. IT DOES NOT, FOR ME, ALTER -- IT DOES S NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEMS I HAVE WITH THE RESOLVE CLAUSE THAT WOULD -- WOULD IN MY VIEW BREAK THE 40/40/20 PROM THAT THE COUNTY MADE ON VOTING ON THE COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY MILLAGE. WE -- COUNCIL MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT THIS MONEY WOULD NOT BE WOULD NOT JUST BE THROWN INTO THE SLUSH FUND IF THE VOTERS PASSED THE MILLAGE. THEY MADE IT CLEAR THAT IT WOULD BE USED TO SUPPORT PREVIOUSLY UNDERFUNFUNDED MUNICIPAL PRIORIS THAT IS TO SAY PEDESTRIAN SAFETY AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND THE GRIEVOUSLY UNDERFUNDED CLIMATE ACTION PLAN AS WAS, NOW THE CARBON NEUTRALITY -- THE A2ZERO CARBON NEUTRALITY PLAN. WHILE REMOVING 40/40/20 DOES NOT IN ITSELF DEFUND THESE PRIORITIES, IT DOES PERMIT THEIR DEFUNDING. IT DOES  FACILITATE THEIR DEFUNDING. IT ENABLES IT DOWNSTREAM. WHICH IS NOT TO SAY THAT -- AND I THINK THAT'S MERELY A FACT. IT'S NOT AN INDICTMENT OF THE GOAL. I DON'T SPEAK TO THE GOAL. BUT IT DOES PERMIT IT. THE FUNDS ARE NOT THERE. THEY ARE NOT SECURED FOR THE PURPOSE. WE HAVE HAD A DIFFICULT TIME FINDING FUNDING TO SUPPORT THE COMMUNITY'S PRIORITY TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE, TO PROMOTE A CARBON NEUTRAL ANN ARBOR. THIS MONEY HAS NOT BEEN TO DATE. WITH THE MILLAGE MONEY COMING BACK FROM THE COUNTY, THIS MONEY IS AVAILABLE. WE ARE ABLE TO SUPPORT STAFF FOR THE PURPOSE. STAFF THAT NEEDS TO BE SECURE. AND SO PROGRAMS THAT NEED TO BE SECURED. WE CAN PROVIDE MONEY INTO THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING ASSISTANCE SERVICES THAT PREVIOUSLY WAS NOT AVAILABLE. WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO, YOU KNOW, BUILD MORE CROSSWALKS AND LINK MORE CROSSWALKS AND BUILD MORE BIKE LANES IN A WAY THAT PREVIOUSLY WE WEREN'T BECAUSE OF THE ABSENCE OF MONEY. THE EXISTENCE OF THE REBATE AND THE EXISTENCE OF THE REBATE IN ITS SECURE FORM IS BOTH A HONOR AND PLEDGE MADE TO THE VOTERS IN ADVANCE OF THEIR VOTE. AND IT SECURES OUR ABILITY TO AI AM IF AND MEET IMPORTANT COMMUNITY VAL. IT'S SOMETHING I FEEL VERY STRONGLY ABOUT. SO WITH RESPECT FOR COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD'S AMENDMENT, IT'S NEITHER HERE NOR THERE. FOR ME, IT'S THE MAINTENANCE OF THE MILLAGE. FURTHER DISCUSSION? OF THE -- OF THE COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD'S AMENDMENT?
05:46:22.070: >> Clerk Beaudry: MAYOR, MAY I CLARIFY, THIS IS NEW LANGUAGE, NOT REPLACING ANY LANGUAGE; IS THAT CORRECT?
05:46:27.475: >> Mayor Taylor: YES, THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING.
05:46:29.678: >> Clerk Beaudry: THANK YOU.
05:46:40.322: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
05:46:41.489: >> Councilmember Griswold:  IF IT'S A FRIENDLY AMENDMENT, DO WE HAVE TO VOTE ON IT?
05:46:46.428: >> Mayor Taylor: NO, I DON'T THINK SO. IS THIS FRIENDLY?
05:46:48.897: >> Councilmember Lumm: MM-HMM.
05:46:49.531: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES.
05:46:50.498: >> Mayor Taylor: THEN IT'S FRIENDLY. FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN MOTION. TIME, I HAVE GOT LUMM, ACKERMAN AND RAMLAWI. PER COUNCILWOMAN GRISWOLD'S REQUEST, I'M GOING TO KEEP TRACK OF TIME. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
05:47:10.719: >> Councilmember Lumm: DO RAMLAWI FIRST.
05:47:14.389: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
05:47:16.157: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU. I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT STARTING MAJOR NEW PROGRAMS UNTIL THE FINANCIAL IMPACTS ARE BETTERED BETTERUNDERSTOOD. CAN YOU IDENTIFY A MAJOR NEW PROGRAM? THAT AHE IS TO THE SPONSORED. -- THAT'S TO THE SPONSORS.
05:47:48.857: >> Councilmember Lumm: I REVISED THIS IN THE LETTER ON MAY 11th E WOULD CONSIDER A MORATORIUM ON MAJOR NEW PROGRAMS. THIS WAS ADJUSTED AFTER CONVERSATIONS WITH -- AND I DON'T WANT TO IMPLY THAT THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR IS SUPPORTIVE OR NOT. HE WAS HELPFUL. SO THIS I CHANGED IT TO ADDRESS CONCERNS OR HIS RECOMMENDATION TO NOT -- NOT SUGGEST THAT WE WOULD PREFER A MORATORIUM BUT THAT WE WOULD KIND OF USE MORE NOT HIS WORDS -- THAT MAJOR NEW PROGRAMS ARE DISCOURAGED AND WE DO UNDERSTAND THAT THE NATURAL IMPACTS AND HOPING IT WAS SELF-EXPLANATORY. IT SEEMS LIKE THE FISCALLY RESPONSE THING TO DO.
05:48:53.121: >> Councilmember Ackerman: CAN YOU GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF A MAJOR NEW PROGRAM? DO YOU HAVE ONE IN MIND?
05:48:59.627: >> Councilmember Lumm: NO.
05:49:00.195: >> Councilmember Ackerman: WOULD THE A2ZERO PLAN COUNT AS A MAJOR NEW PROGRAM.
05:49:05.934: >> Councilmember Lumm: UNTIL WE UNDERSTAND THE FINANCIAL IMPACTS AND HOW WE CAN ADDRESS THEM, I MEAN, I FOR ONE -- I PERSONALLY DON'T THINK IT'S -- I PHILOSOPHICALLY DON'T THINK IT'S RESPONSIBLE TO EMBARK ON A MAJOR PROGRAM WHEN WE -- WHEN WE DON'T KNOW HOW WE ARE GOING TO ADDRESS THE FINANCIAL IMPACTS AND THE -- AND THE PLAN IS NOT DEFINED. AND THAT'S JUST SAYING THAT'S WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO AND THEN WE WILL DISCOURAGE EMBARKING ON A NEW PROGRAM UNTIL WE HAVE THOSE -- HAVE THAT SORT OF INFORMATION, THAT DATA.
05:49:46.041: >> Councilmember Ackerman: JUST TO PUT A REALLY FINE POINT, WOULD YOU CONSIDER THE A2ZERO PLAN A NEW PROGRAM?
05:49:58.019: >> Councilmember Lumm: WE TALKED THAT ONE TO DEATH. YOU KNOW, THIS IS MAJOR NEW PROGRAMS.
05:50:10.999: >> Mayor Taylor: A CLARIFYING AMENDMENT MIGHT BE IN ORDER AT SOME POINT LATER ON IN THE CONVERSATION. COUNCILMEMBER NELSON?
05:50:21.943: >> Councilmember Nelson: OKAY. THAT POINT RAISED SOMETHING THAT I -- OR REMINDED ME OF SOMETHING THAT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER THAT I THOUGHT WAS WORTH CLARIFYING. MR. CRAWFORD, IF THERE WAS A REMARKABLE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF EITHER CHEAP FUNDING OR A BETTER OPPORTUNITY OR A DEAL ON NEGOTIATING SOMETHING THAT WAS FINANCIALING ADVANTAGEOUS, WOULD YOU FIND THE WORDING OF THIS RESOLUTION THAT YOU WOULDN'T OFFER IT UP AS AN OPTION OR SUGGEST IT TO US?
05:51:00.115: >> City Admin. Crawford: THE -- INSTEAD OF GIVING A YES OR NO ANSWER, I WOULD SAY I FEEL COMFORTABLE BRINGING ANYTHING UP TO YOU BECAUSE THIS IS A POLICY GUIDANCE AND ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN FOR POLICIES. BEING SHOVEL READY, THERE'S THOUGHTS AND EFFORTS AND SOME THINGS THAT HAVE CERTAINLY STARTED AND HAVING THOSE CONTINUE TO A POINT THAT THEY MIGHT BE READY WHAT IT MEANS BY START, MAYBE -- MAYBE I MIGHT HAVE A DIFFERENT INTERPRETATION THAN EACH OF YOUR COUNCILMEMBERS. I DO THINK -- UNLESS ADVISED OTHERWISE, I WOULD MOVE THINGS ALONG TO THE POINT THAT SERIOUS FUNDING WITH THAT PART OF THE PROJECT CAME, WE MIGHT STOP THERE TO SEE IF THERE WERE FUNDS AVAILABLE. BUT THAT WOULD NOT MEAN THAT WE WOULD NOT MAKE PROGRESS ON SOME PROJECTS.
05:52:08.917: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I APPRECIATE THAT BECAUSE ALL OF MY EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH YOU, YOU WERE PRETTY UP FRONT EXPLAINING STUFF TO US. IT STRIKES ME IF IT WAS SUDDENLY IT WAS VERY EXPENSIVE TO GET MONEY, AND CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS WERE A BETTER DEAL THAN PREVIOUS, OF COURSE WE WOULD BE AWARE OF THAT AND HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THAT. THANK YOU.
05:52:41.616: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
05:52:42.517: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, MAYOR. AND JUST TO PUT TOM BACK ON THE HOT SEAT, WHICH HE SEEMS TO DO PRETTY WELL THERE. TO ADDRESS COUNCIL ACKERMAN'S CONCERN AND MANY OTHERS IN THE COMMUNITY WHO BELIEVE THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO GET AWAY FROM OUR PLEDPLEDGE OF CARBON NEUTRALITY, WOULD YOU CONSIDER A2ZERO AS A NEW PROGRAM OR ONE THAT'S ALREADY UNDERWAY.
05:53:15.516: >> City Admin. Crawford: I CONSIDER A2ZERO SEVEN STRATEGIES AND THOSE STRATEGIES HAVE DIFFERENT PROJECTS WITHIN THEM. SOME OF THE PROJECTS HAVE STARTED AND MOVED. THE MOST RELEVANT THINGS. SOME OF THOSE YOU CAN MOVE WITH STAFF. THOSE SEEM TO BE LOW HANGING FOOT IF WE HAVE STAFF ON BOARD. AND OTHER THINGS LIKE THE SOLAR DOWN AT THE PROPERTY ON SOUTH SIDE OF TOWN THAT HAS HAD SIGNIFICANT WORK DONE ON IT. THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF A PROJECT THAT HAVING IT PROGRESS TO A POINT WHERE IT'S FUNDING READY WOULD BE ADVANTAGEOUS TO THE COMMUNITY. THAT'S MY OPINION. ON A2ZERO OR ANY OTHER PROJECT, I WOULD WANT TO -- I WOULD PROBABLY UPDATE YOU GUYS ON WHAT I'M PLANNING TO DO AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU GUYS HAD PROVIDED DIRECTION ON THAT IF IT WAS NOT CONSISTENT WITH WHAT YOU WANTED.
05:54:23.451: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I APPRECIATE YOUR FORTHRIGHTNESS FOR ANSWERING THOSE QUESTIONS. IT'S NOT EASY NAVIGATING THIS TOPIC. AND JUST BEATING A DEAD HORSE, AGAIN, IF WE WANTED TO HAVE DEDICATED FUNDS FOR THESE PROGRAMS, IN A WAY WHERE NO COUNCIL CAN MESS WITH THEM, THEN IT SHOULD BE TAKEN TO THE BALLOT AND HAVING THE VOTERS DECIDE THE PROPER BALLOT LANGUAGE. NOT FOR DEFUNDING ANYTHING, I'M FOR GOOD GOVERNMENT. THAT'S WHAT I'M FOR. I'M FOR CONSISTENT, GOOD, LEGAL GOVERNMENT. AND IF THAT MILLAGE WAS INTENDED FOR THOSE THREE ISSUES, THEN THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN PUT IN THE BALLOT LANGUAGE OR PUT IN ANOTHER ONE TO THE VOTERS. I'M SORRY TO BEAT A DEAD HORSE.
05:55:27.382: >> City Admin. Crawford: TO INTERJECT ON THIS CONTROVERSIAL TOPIC. TO POINT OUT, THE MILLAGE WAS ACTUALLY A COUNTY MILLAGE AND NOT ONE THAT YOUR COUNCIL HAD THE ABILITY TO PUT LANGUAGE ON AND THAT'S WHY THE GENESIS OF THE RESOLUTIONS.
05:55:44.265: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I GET IT. THANK YOU.
05:55:59.180: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER SMITH.
05:56:01.382: >> Councilmember Smith: I THINK COUNCILMEMBER LUMM'S ANSWER TO ACKERMAN'S QUESTION CEMENTED HOW I'M GOING TO VOTE. I THINK THIS IS FLAWED. I THINK THAT WE SHOULD JUST VOTE AND MOVE ON. THANKS.
05:56:16.564: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
05:56:17.632: >> Councilmember Hayner:  IN KEEPING WITH THE VERY BRIEF COMMENTS AND MOVE ON, YEAH, YOU KNOW, I WANT TO SAY, I SHARE MR.  -- OR COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN'S CONCERN. I DON'T COUNT A2ZERO AS A MAJOR NEW PROGRAM THAT IS STARTING, IT IS, BUT IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR A LONG TIME AND THE PLANNING IS GOING ON SINCE 2014. I CERTAINLY HOPE THIS DOESN'T INDICATE THAT. I MEAN IF ANYBODY THINKS THAT IT MIGHT OR FEARS THAT IT MIGHT, FEEL FREE TO STRIKE IT. I DON'T. I DON'T KNOW WHAT WOULD COUNT AS MAJOR NEW PROGRAM. I'M TRYING TO -- I'M RACKING MY BRABRAIN. I WANTED TO BRING A PILOT PROGRAM FOR US, THAT'S SOME TIME AND PUBLIC COMMUNICATION ISSUE. I'M HARD PRESSED TO THINK WHAT A MAJOR NEW PROGRAM IS. WOULD IT BE THE CENTER OF THE CITY PROJECT? WOULD IT BE THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECT? I DON'T KNOW WHAT FITS THAT DESCRIPTION. SO I APPRECIATE YOUR ASKING. MAYBE THAT IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE STRUCK. WHY IS IT THERE? I GUESS THAT'S WHAT I HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THAT. YOU KNOW, I JUST KIND OF PASSED OVER IT BECAUSE I COULDN'T THINK OF WHAT IT WOULD POSSIBLY APPLY TO. YOU KNOW, I WOULD HATE TO SEE IT CRAMP UP AND BRING A PILOT PROGRAM FORWARD OR, YOU KNOW, SOMETHING -- THAT WOULD BE NEW TO US, RIGHT? WE HAVE NEVER DONE THAT BEFORE, AND IT'S SOMETHING I THINK WE NEED TO DO, NOT ONLY LOOK TO WHERE TO CUT MONEY BUT LOOK TO RAISE MONEY, AND RAISE REVENUE AND WE KNOW A PILOT WOULD BRING THAT OPPORTUNITY. YEAH. YOU KNOW, YOU SHARE YOUR CONCERNS ABOUT THAT, COUNCILMEMBER HACKERMAN. YOU KNOW, WHAT WOULD THAT PROHIBIT US FROM DOING. I DON'T KNOW IT'S GOT ME THINKING ALL OF A SUDDEN. THAT'S ALL. THANK YOU.
05:58:12.780: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
05:58:14.015: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANKS. I WOULD JUST SAY THAT BULLET POINT READ, MAJOR -- THE FINANCIAL IMPACTS ARE BETTER UNDERSTOOD AND THE CITY'S PLANS TO ADDRESS THEM ARE BETTER DEFINED. FOR ME, IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW, KIND OF A FISCAL STEWARDSHIP, RESPONSIBLE THING TO DO, BUT IF IT GIVES PEOPLE HEARTBURN, I WILL REMOVE IT.
05:58:50.084: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE -- IS CTHAT A MOTION TO REMOVE IT.
05:58:56.023: >> Councilmember Lumm: IT SOMEONE WANTS TO MAKE IT.
05:59:01.429: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER AND THEN NELSON. THE STA STA STARTING NEW MAJOR S IS DELETED. AND THAT'S FRIENDLY TO THE BODY. FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN MOTION AS AMENDED. COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN?
05:59:18.479: >> Councilmember Ackerman: SORRY. I HAVE TO FINISH AN AMENDMENT. I APOLOGIZE.
05:59:46.974: >> Councilmember Hayner:  IS IT RAINING WHERE EVERYONE ELSE IS? HARD RAIN. IT'S BEEN ON AND OFF ALL DAY OVER HERE. WE HAD A COUPLE OF PRETTY BIG ONES NOT LONG AGO.
06:00:07.128: >> Councilmember Ackerman: MS. BEAUDRY, I JUST SENT IT TO YOU. IT WOULD BE AN AMENDMENT TO COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD'S ADDED RESOLVE CLAUSE. ESSENTIALLY THIS WOULD LOCK IN THE BASELINE OF FUNDING FOR THE PEDESTRIAN SAFETY. AND IT WOULD BE A COMMITMENT NOT TO FUND THEM THROUGH NECESSARILY KNOWLEDGE, BUT WOULD BE A COMMITMENT TO FUND THEM NONETHELESS.
06:00:40.194: >> Mayor Taylor: I GUESS I WILL OBSERVE THAT THAT AMENDMENT IS CONSISTENT WITH A PREEXISTING BUDGET AMENDMENT, A PREEXISTING RESOLUTION PASSED BY THIS COUNCIL PASSED BACK IN APRIL. APRIL 1st, 2019, WHICH WAS AN EFFORT TO PUT THIS ENTIRE ISSUE AT REST. HAS THAT BEEN DISTRIBUTED?
06:01:06.654: >> Clerk Beaudry: I SENT IT, MAYOR.
06:01:08.289: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. IS THERE A SECOND? IS THERE NO MULTIPLIER ON THAT, COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN?
06:01:19.900: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  IF YOU HAVE RECOMMENDED LANGUAGE, I'M HAPPY TO AMEND THE AMENDMENT. IS.
06:01:36.851: >> Mayor Taylor: CAN YOU REPEAT THAT?
06:01:37.718: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  IF YOU HAVE OTHER LANGUAGE FOR THE MULTIPLIER, I'M HAPPY TO --
06:01:48.696: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE A SECOND ON THIS?
06:01:50.264: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES, COUNCILMEMBER SMITH ALREADY DID.
06:01:53.567: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER SMITH. BASICALLY WITH THIS -- WHAT THIS AMENDMENT DOES AND THE OTHER PREVIOUSLY ACCEPTED AMENDMENT DOES, IS PUTS IN THIS AMENDMENT, IN THIS RESOLUTION, THE EXACT -- THE EXACT LANGUAGE IN PRINCIPLE THAT -- THAT COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD AND I WORKED OUT AND PUT TOGETHER AND WAS APPROVED BY CITY COUNCIL BACK IN APRIL OF 2019. IT WOULD PUT THIS CONVERSATION TO BED AND PROVIDE GENERAL FUND -- TO PROVIDE ESSENTIALLY A PARALLEL LOCK BOX, A PARALLEL RESOLUTION FOR THE PURPOSE. I GUESS I SHOULD STOP TALKING ABOUT THIS. I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS BECAUSE IT'S INNOCUOUS, BUT, YOU KNOW, MY PREVIOUS MAJOR CONCERN WITH RESPECT TO AVOIDING OF THE 40/40/20 CLOCKED IN SUBMITMENT STANCE. COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
06:03:03.437: >> Councilmember Bannister:  I HAD A QUESTION NO THE SO MUCH ON THIS CURRENT NEW AMENDMENT. MY HAND WAS UP ABOUT THE FIRST BULLET. SO I COULD COME BACK TO ME AFTER WE FINISH THIS PART.
06:03:15.249: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. COUNCILMEMBER NELSON -- EATON.
06:03:19.987: >> Councilmember Eaton: THANK YOU. I WOULD BE WILLING TO ACCEPT IT IF IT DOESN'T ADDRESS PEDESTRIAN SAFETY. I THINK THAT OUR COMMUNITY HOUSING NEEDS AND FOOD INSECURITY ISSUES ARE GOING TO BE ANNOUNCED DURING THIS RECESSION AND I WANT AS MUCH FLEXIBILITY AS POSSIBLE. LAST YEAR WE ADDRESSED IT IN THIS FASHION BUT WE SINCE HAD A PANDEMIC AND WE ARE HEADED INTO A VERY DEEP AND WHAT I BELIEVE WILL BE A LENGTHY RECESSION AND I REALLY WANT ENOUGH MONEY TO FUND HUMAN SERVICES. AND SO IF, IN FACT, WE DON'T HAVE A NEED FOR THOSE THINGS, WE -- THEN LET'S DO A LOT OF PEDESTRIAN SAFETY, BUT I WOULD PREFER THAT THAT $440,000 THAT'S SET ASIDE FOR PEDESTRIAN SAFETY AND YOUR AMENDMENT BE JUST PERMITTED TO BE USED AS WE NEED IT.
06:04:21.615: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  I THINK -- I'M SORRY.
06:04:25.719: >> Mayor Taylor: I HAVE COUNCILMEMBER NELSON AND RAMLAWI. COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
06:04:31.859: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I JUST WANT TO GO ON RECORD AS SAYING THAT I THINK THIS -- THAT SOME -- SOME OF US HERE ARE PRETENDING THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE THE WORK SESSION LAST WEEK AND WE ARE -- TO BRING UP THE -- TO TRY TO REPLICATE THE EXACT SAME BUDGETARY COULD COMPROMISE THAT HAPPENED AI YEAR AGO AS IF OUR CIRCUMSTANCES ARE THE SAME AS THETHEY WERE A YEAR AGO. THE WHOLE POINT THAT COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD AND LUMM AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THE VERY DIFFERENT FINANCIAL SITUATION THAT WE ARE IN RIGHT NOW. AND I'M JUST ASTONISHED THAT -- I JUST AM VERY SHOCKED AT WHAT I'M HEARING AND MAYBE IT'S EASIER TO PRETEND AND IT WILL ALL BECOME CLEAR TWO MONTHS FROM NOW. AND WE'RE JUST SORT OF PRETENDING AS LONG AS WE POSSIBLY CAN, BUT I -- I THINK IT'S IRRESPONSIBLE. I THINK IT'S IRRESPONSIBLE FOR ANYONE SITTING AT THIS TABLE TO CLING TO THIS PROMISE FROM TWO YEARS AGO AND NOT OPEN THEIR EYES TO HOW -- HOW PROFOUNDLY DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES ARE NOW. I APPRECIATE THAT IT WAS A LOVELY PROMISE TO MAKE TWO YEARS AGO. AND THE COMPROMISE THAT WAS ATTEMPTED LAST YEAR, IT WAS ACKNOWLEDGING YES, FINANCIALLY THESE THINGS COULD BE FUNDED AND WE CAN GUARANTEE THE FUNDING AND THAT WOULD BE OKAY, BUT LAST YEAR IT WAS COGNIZANT THAT THE FINANCIAL SITUATION IS NOT ALWAYS GOING TO BE THE SAME. I MEAN, I -- I'M JUST -- THERE'S NO WAY I WOULD SUPPORT THE SAME COMPROMISE THAT WAS PRESENTED A YEAR AGO AS IF IT'S THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE THE SAME. IT'S SILLY. THANKS.
06:06:23.404: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
06:06:24.638: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES, AS WE T CONTINUE SOMETIMES BACKPEDAL. I'M NOT NEAR AS UPSET AS MY COLLEAGUE, COUNCILMEMBER NELSON IS ABOUT WHERE THIS IS HEADING AGAIN. BUT I SUPPORT THIS. WE HAVE MANY DIFFERENT SOURCES OF FUNDING FOR PEDESTRIAN FUNDING, DDA BEING ONE AND, OF COURSE, MANY OTHER SOURCES OF FUNDING FOR THAT. SO I DEFINITELY SUPPORT IF WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE AMENDMENT STILL OR WHERE WE ARE AT RIGHT NOW IN THIS CONVERSATION. I'M NOT SURE. BUT I WOULD SUPPORT COUNCILMEMBER EATON'S MOTION IF THAT'S WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT.
06:07:14.354: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
06:07:15.255: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  I WILL JUST SAY I OFFERED THIS, TRYING TO MOVE THE CONVERSATION FORWARD. I APOLOGIZE IF IT STRUCK A CORD AND IT IS THE BODY'S BUT I WOULD BE HAPPY TO WITHDRAW IT IF THAT WOULD BE MORE COMFORTABLE FOR PEOPLE.
06:07:29.770: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I HAVE ONE QUESTION, I DIDN'T ASK MR. CRAWFORD. WHAT ARE WE SPENDING ON CLIMATE ACTION? 1.6?
06:07:43.183: >> Councilmember Lumm: 1.8. MAG THE NUMBERS THAT DR. SHULTZ ARE GENERALLY CORRECT. THERE'S $1.6 MILLION BUT THERE'S ALSO SOME ALLOCATED FUNDS. IN OTHER WORDS STAFF WHO WORKS ON SOME AND OTHER FUNDS CHARGED TO IT. I WOULD SAY 1.6 IS WHAT YOU WOULD GENERALLY RECOGNIZE AND SHE ALSO TALKS ABOUT THE SOLID WASTE FUND AS IF THERE ARE FUNDS THAT BECOME AVAILABLE TO MEET THE SOLID WASTE OBJECTIVES WHICH ALSO HELP A2ZERO AT THE SAME TIME WITHIN THAT PLAN, BUT 1.6 IS PROBABLY WHAT YOU WOULD.
06:08:23.290: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  SO THIS IS INNOCUOUS? THIS HAL IS HALF OF WHAT WE EXPT TO SPEND?
06:08:35.335: >> City Admin. Crawford: LET ME CHECK. I HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU.
06:08:37.471: >> Mayor Taylor: YOU STILL HAVE THE FLOOR.
06:08:39.039: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  AND THIS IS GENERAL FUND DOLLARS?
06:08:42.876: >> City Admin. Crawford: I'M SORRY?
06:08:43.710: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: WITH THIS MOTION, THIS WOULD BE GENERAL FUND DOLLARS? SO WE ARE GETTING AWAY FROM BEING TETHERED AND WE ARE TALKING APPLES TO APPLES AND RIGHT NOW WE HAVE $1.6 MILLION THAT APPLIED TO CLIMATE ACTION?
06:09:06.066: >> City Admin. Crawford: IS THAT A QUESTION OR A STATEMENT?
06:09:07.901: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: IT'S A QUESTION SAYING THAT WE'RE -- COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN PROPOSED A BASELINE OF $880,000 WHICH CURRENTLY IS LESS THAN WHAT WE'RE ALREADY APPLYING FOR CLIMATE ACTION.
06:09:22.382: >> City Admin. Crawford: OH, I SEE. IF YOU COMBINE THEM TOGETHER.
06:09:26.420: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES.
06:09:28.822: >> City Admin. Crawford: YES, THE MILLAGE AND THE GENERAL FUND. IF YOU COMBINE THEM TOGETHER AND HE'S LIM LIMITING, IT'S --
06:09:41.068: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  IF I COULD, I -- I RAISED THIS TO MOVE THE CONVERSATION FORWARD. I STRUCK A CORD THAT I DIDN'T INTEND. I'M HAPPY TO WALK IT BACK IF PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN THAT. IT'S UP TO YOU. I DIDN'T MEAN TO INSIGHT THE REACTIONS THAT I DID.
06:10:03.423: >> Mayor Taylor: DOES ANYBODY HAVE ANY ACTIONS TO IT BEING WITHDRAWN.
06:10:08.362: >> Councilmember Eaton: I WOULD PREFER WE MAINTAIN THE AMENDMENT, BUT JUST STRIKE THE LANGUAGE REGARDING PEDESTRIAN SAFETY MONEY.
06:10:27.914: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THAT FRIENDLY AMENDMENT? I MEAN -- DOES ANYBODY HAVE ANY OBJECTION TO THAT AS AN AMENDMENT -- AS A FRIENDLY AMENDMENT TO THE AMENDMENT? SEEING NONE, I'M GOING TO DECLARE THAT TO BE A FRIENDLY AMENDMENT TO THE AMENDMENT. THE AMENDMENT THEREFORE NOW READS RESOLVE AT THE BASE LEVEL OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING, SET AT 880, CLIMATE ACTION FUNDING IS ALSO SET AT 880. THAT IS THE AMENDMENT. AND IT IS THE BODY'S AND SO IT'S LIVE. COUNCILMEMBER EATON, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
06:11:10.590: >> Councilmember Eaton: I MOVE THAT AND IT'S ACCEPTED. SO I'M DONE.
06:11:18.365: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
06:11:19.366: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES, I HAD A COMMENT ON THE 440 FOR THE PEDESTRIAN SAFETY, BECAUSE IF WE ARE TALKING ABOUT SAVINGS AND HUMAN SERVICES AND YET CERTAIN SILOS IN CITY HALL MIGHT BE COMING THROUGH AND PUTTING IN SIDEWALKS, EXPENSIVE SIDEWALKS, COULD THIS 440 BE CONSIDERED HUMAN SERVICES IF THAT WAS MAYBE SOME OF THE MONEY THAT WE WERE GOING TO USE TO HELP DEFRAY THE -- THE BURDEN ON THE HOMEOWNER? AS PART OF THE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. I WOULD BE HAPPY TO HOLD OFF ON SOME OF THE WA SIDEWALKS GOING FORWARD. THEN MAYBE THE PEDESTRIAN SAFETY MONEY WOULD HELP PAY FOR THE INVOLUNTARY SIDEWALKS. AND HAVE THE SAME POSITIVE EFFECT THAT COUNCILMEMBER EATON WAS LOOKING FOR IN HELPING VULNERABLE O HOMEOWNERS.
06:12:34.074: >> Councilmember Eaton: THE INTENTION OF THE AMENDMENT IS TO LEAVE THAT MONEY UNRESTRICTED AS WE LOOK FOR WAYS TO BALANCE OUR BUDGET.
06:12:55.362: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE AMENDMENT? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES]
06:13:03.537: >> Mayor Taylor: AM. I GETTING A NO? HANE>> Councilmember Hayner:  IM NOT.
06:13:17.250: >> Mayor Taylor: CAN I GET A ROLL CALL VOTE. IT'S THE AMENDMENT BY ACKERMAN SETTING THE --
06:13:25.559: >> Councilmember Nelson: OKAY. I THOUGHT THAT WAS A FRIENDLY AMENDMENT. I GUESS I MISSED THAT.
06:13:30.831: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER EATON'S AMENDMENT STRIPPING THE PEDESTRIAN SAFETY FUNDING REFERENCE WAS FRIENDLY. EVERYBODY CLEAR? ROLL CALL VOTE ON THE AMENDMENT -- THE AMENDED AMENDMENT, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
06:13:52.118: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES.
06:13:56.423: >> Councilmember Hayner:  NO.
06:14:07.767: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES.
06:14:12.639: >> Councilmember Griswold YES.

06:14:36.763: >> Councilmember Smith: NO.
06:14:37.931: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION CARRIES.
06:14:40.300: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN MOTION AS AMENDED? COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
06:14:48.441: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES, WELL, ON THAT FIRST BULLET ABOUT INVOLUNTARY EMPLOYEE LAYOFFS WILL BE UTILIZED VERY SELECT ENVIRONMENTALLY OR AS A LAST RESORT, THAT SOUNDS GREAT, BUT I SORT OF WANTED TO FOLLOW UP OPEN COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI'S QUESTION TO MR. CRAWFORD, THAT I REMEMBER BACK ON MAY 11th, ON SLIDE 16, WE HAD A LINE ITEM FOR INVOLUNTARY FURLOUGHS, $2.5 MILLION. SO I WAS JUST TRYING TO CLOSE THE LOOP THERE THAT ARE WE OR AREN'T WE GOING TO -- OR WHAT DOES MR. CRAWFORD THINK WE WILL NEED WITH REGARD TO --
06:15:34.754: >> City Admin. Crawford: THANK YOU. THAT LIST FROM THE PRESENTATION IS SOMETHING WE WOULD LOOK AS WE GET GREATER AND GREATER CONFIDENCE OF A REVENUE SHORTFALL AND I WOULD INTERPRET THIS RESOLUTION TO SAY INVOLUNTARY SHOULD BE TOWARDS THE BOTTOM OF THE THINGS TO IMPLEMENT. IT DOESN'T REMOVE IT AS A POSSIBILITY, BUT IT DOES MOVE IT TO THE BOTTOM. KRAG>> Councilmember Bannister: AND THAT'S HOW IT CURRENTLY READS?
06:16:07.253: >> City Admin. Crawford: YES.
06:16:07.887: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
06:16:08.755: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE GO DOWN THIS THESE ROUTES WITH THESE AMENDMENTS. IF THIS HAD -- WAS -- THIS STARTED OUT TO BE SOME KIND OF GUIDANCE FOR OUR CITY ADMINISTRATOR TO GIVE HIM THE WHEREWITHAL AND THE GENERAL GUIDANCE TO DO WHAT HE DOES BEST, AND NOW WE ARE PUTTING MONEY INTO IT. I DON'T EVEN GET IT. LIKE, I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHERE WE ARE THINK WE ARE COMING FROM WITH THIS. I -- I -- THIS IS ONE CASE WHERE I HAPPILY DEFER TO HIS EXPERTISE, AND I'M SORRY TO SEE THAT SPELLING OUT THE DOLLARS GOT ADDED TO THIS, AND IT MAKES ME EVEN LESS LIKELY TO SUPPORT IT ON THE WHOLE. I JUST -- I THINK -- I THINK WE'RE NOT THINKING CLEARLY. THANK YOU.
06:16:54.200: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
06:16:55.402: >> Councilmember Lumm: SO I'M GOING TO FIRST ON THE FIRST BULLET, I WILL JUST SAY THAT I TALKED THROUGH THIS WITH MR. CRAWFORD WHEN I WROTE IT AND THIS HANG REFLECTS HIS RECOMMENDATION. THIS BULLET, AS WITH MANY OF THEM, ARE INTENDED TO GIVE STAFF DIRECTION BUT AT THE SAME TIME PROVIDE COUNCIL POLICY LEVEL DIRECTION, PRINCIPLES, EXPECTATIONS, ON IMPLEMENTING A RECOVERY PLAN THAT AS WE ALL KNOW TOUGH DECISIONS AND HARD CHOICES THAT WILL BE IMPACTING EMPLOYEES, SERVICES, AND ALL OF OUR RESIDENTS, AND I HAVE TO SAY IF IT'S NOT -- SO I DO HOPE YOU SUPPORT THIS. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, IF IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE FOR COUNCIL TO WEIGH IN ON THIS UP FRONT WITH POLICY DIRECTION, HONESTLY, I'M NOT SURE WHEN IT WOULD EVER BE APPROPRIATE, I'M NOT SURE WHAT OUR JOB IS IF NOT THAT. WE HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO APPROVE THE BUDGET. THAT IS A CORE FUNDAMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY, AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WHEN WE HAVE A SITUATION LIKE THIS, WHEN WE HAVE A BUDGET BEFORE US THAT IS UNVIABLE, AND CLEARLY NEEDS TO BE REVISED SUBSTANTIALLY, AND TOUGH ACTIONS NEED TO BE TAKEN TO CUT COSTS, AND WE OBVIOUSLY CAN'T DO THAT AS WE TRADITIONALLY WOULD LINE BY LINE. WE HAVE TO -- WE ARE APPROVING THE BUDGET TONIGHT. AGAIN, THROUGH NO FAULT OF STAFF'S. COUNCIL CAN EITHER PROVIDE SOME DIRECTION UP FRONT ON PRINCIPLES AND EXPECTATIONS ON THOSE ACTIONS OR WE COULD JUST BE REACTIVE AND DELEGATE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO STAFF. I JUST THINK THAT THE FORMER IS MORE CONSISTENT WITH WHAT COUNCIL AS THE POLICY MAKING BODY SHOULD DO, AND HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH STAFF'S CAPABILITY. AND I REWROTE A NUMBER OF THE BULLETS TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT -- THAT WE ARE PROVIDING THE ADMINISTRATOR THE NECESSARY DISCRETION AND MR. CRAWFORD WAS COMFORTABLE WITH THE LANGUAGE. I WILL JUST SAY THAT I HAVE ALSO HEARD FROM PEOPLE WHO FEEL LIKE GIVING THE STAFF -- WE'RE GIVING THE STAFF TOO MUCH DISCRETION. SO THERE ARE MANY COMPROMISES HERE. BUT IN GENERAL, IT IS OUR JOB TO PROVIDE POLICY DIRECTION ON IMPORTANT MATTERS AND THEY ARE NOT MAKING MORE IMPORTANT MATTERS THAN HOW TO IMPLEMENT SUBSTANTIAL BUDGET CUTS. WELL THEN AGAIN WE'LL LIKELY HAVE MAJOR IMPACT ON OUR EMPLOYEES, ON OUR SERVICES AND ON OUR RESIDENTS. SO I WOULD HOPE THAT YOU WOULD BE COMFORTABLE SUPPORTING, PROVIDING THIS KIND OF POLICY GUIDANCE. THANK YOU.
06:20:02.155: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
06:20:03.056: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. I KNOW IT'S REALLY LATE, BUT I WANT TO SAY THANKS -- I APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S WILLINGNESS TO COME TOGETHER AND COMPROMISE ON THIS. I KNOW IT'S IN A -- DEFINITELY TEXTBOOK SAUSAGE MAKING PROCESS OF GOVERNMENT, BUT I THINK WE HAVE MADE SOME STRIDES AND WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GIVE, IN TURN, OUR CITY ADMINISTRATOR GUIDANCE. WE HAVE DEDICATED FUNDING BASED ON OUR POLICY DIRECTION. AND I HOPE THAT THE PUBLIC IS REASSURED WITH OUR PRIORITIES AND OUR COMMITMENT TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND CLIMATE ACTION. AND HOPEFULLY THIS SOLVES A LOT OF THE UNCERTAINTY OUT THERE AND GIVE OUR CITY ADMINISTRATOR THE TOOLS NECESSARY TO FULFILL THE POLICY THAT WE ARE PURSUING ON BOTH OF THOSE ITEMS. SO I KNOW NO ONE IS HAPPY HERE, BUT I THINK OVERALL, IT'S A WIN FOR THE COMMUNITY.
06:21:06.552: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN MOTION AS AMENDED? PER PRIOR I'M GOING TO VOTE AGAINST THE MAIN MOTION AS AMENDED AND I CONTINUE TO HAVE -- ALTHOUGH I'M SOMEWHAT MODIFIED ON WHERE WE STAND ON THE TWO MAIN PRIORITIES I CONTINUE TO HAVE SUBSTANTIAL CONCERNS WITH RESPECT TO THE WALK BACK OF THE BREAKING OF THE 40/40/20 PRO PROMISE. 20 PROMISE. IN MY VIEW, PUTTING THOSE MONIES INTO THE GENERAL FUND OPENS THE DDOOR FOR THEIR REDUCTION AND THAT'S NOT SOMETHING I'M WILLING TO DO. FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
06:21:58.671: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES.
06:22:03.042: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES.
06:22:08.381: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES.
06:22:14.253: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES.
06:22:22.095: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES.
06:22:22.695: >> Councilmember Grand: NO.
06:22:23.296: >> Councilmember Ackerman: NO.
06:22:30.470: >> Mayor Taylor: NO.
06:22:32.438: >> Councilmember Eaton: YES.
06:22:33.039: >> Councilmember Nelson:  YES.
06:22:37.510: >> Councilmember Smith: NO.
06:22:38.111: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION CARRIES.
06:22:40.747: >> Mayor Taylor: DO FOLKS WANT TO TAKE A BREAK OR DRIVE THROUGH.
06:22:45.218: >> Councilmember Smith: LET'S KEEP GOING IT'S 1:20.
06:22:48.821: >> Mayor Taylor: WE ARE DRIVING THROUGH. DS-2. RESOLUTION TO ADOPT ANN ARBOR CITY BUDGET AND RELATED PROPERTY TAX MILLAGE RATES FOR FISCAL YEAR 2021. MOVED BY SMITH AND SECONDED BY RAMLAWI. DISCUSSION OF DS-2. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
06:23:09.675: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU. LET'S SEE, I ACTUALLY THOUGHT WE MIGHT TAKE A BREAK. I WILL TORONTO DEUCE THE AMENDMENT TO INTRODUCE FUNDING FOR STREET REPAIR.
06:23:26.125: >> Mayor Taylor: SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN. COUNCIL MEMBER LUMM, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
06:23:31.197: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU. THIS AMENDMENT IS PRETTY STRAIGHT FORWARD. WHAT IT DOES IS TO PROVIDE COUNCIL AUTHORIZATION TO TEMPORARILY DIP INTO LOCAL STREET FUND RESERVES TO COMPLETE THE LOCAL ROAD REPAIR PROJECTS ORIGINALLY CONTEMPLATED IN THE ADMINISTRATOR'S APRIL 16th. IT WAS ESTIMATED THAT THE LOCAL STREET FUNDING FROM THE STATE WOULD BE DOWN $600,000. AND THERE WAS A $495,000 RECOVERY PLAN LINE ITEM FOR REDUCTION IN REDUCED ROAD MAINTENANCE. AT THAT MEETING, MR. CRAWFORD INDICATED ONE POSSIBILITY WOULD BE TO TEMPORARILY DIP INTO RESERVES. I CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO ADD ITEMS TO THE BUDGE ET CETERA WHAT IT DOES IS -- BUDGET, WHAT DOES IS PROVIDE STAFF TO COMPLETE ROAD PROJECTS WHEN TRAFFIC IS WAY DOWN AND THE DISRUPTION CAUSED BY CORRUPTION PROJECTS IS MUCH %-úY FUND BALANCE. THE FUND BALANCE WILL NEED TO BE RESTORED IN FUTURE YEARS BUT THIS PROVIDES STAFF FLEXIBILITY NOW TO DO WHAT WAS ORIGINALLY PLANNED FOR FISCAL YEAR '21 AND WE KNOW THAT THE CONDITION OF OUR ROADS IS A HIGH PRIORITY FOR OUR RESIDENTS. YOU MAY RECALL THAT ROAD REPAIR ITEMS RA RANKED ONE, TWO, AND FR WHEN WE CONDUCTED THE RESIDENTIAL RATE OF SPENDING PRIORITIES A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO. ANYWAY, I HOPE YOU WILL SUPPORT THIS TONIGHT AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.
06:25:09.262: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER NELSON?
06:25:11.631: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I THINK THIS QUESTION IS FOR MR. CRAWFORD. I'M NOT TOTALLY SURE I UNDERSTOOD YOUR EXPLANATION OF THIS, JANE. THESE ARE YOU -- YOU ARE ASKINGT THESE FUNDS ARE USED FOR -- YOU SAID THESE ARE NOT FUNDS THAT COULD BE USED FOR SOMETHING ELSE?
06:25:40.893: >> Councilmember Lumm: CORRECT.
06:25:41.561: >> Councilmember Nelson: MR. CRAWFORD WHY ARE WE NOT ALREADY DOING THIS? WHY IS THIS AN AMENDMENT?
06:25:51.437: >> City Admin. Crawford: WHY IS IT AN AMENDMENT?
06:25:53.539: >> Councilmember Nelson: YEAH.
06:25:55.942: >> City Admin. Crawford: I'M NOT UNDERSTANDING YOUR QUESTION, WE DID NOT HAVE -- WE DIDN'T -- I MEAN I HAVE TO LOOK AT HER AMENDMENT. JUST A SECOND.
06:26:08.087: >> Councilmember Nelson:  OH. MAYBE JANE KNOWS THE ANSWER.
06:26:14.126: >> City Admin. Crawford: YEAH.
06:26:14.760: >> Councilmember Lumm: WELL, THE -- THERE IS A -- WE HAVE A FUND BALANCE POLICY. AMI HELPING YOU.
06:26:33.045: >> Councilmember Nelson: OKAY. SO YOU ARE SAYING THAT THERE'S A --
06:26:35.948: >> City Admin. Crawford: LET ME CLARIFY. LET ME CLARIFY. SO IN THE FINANCIAL -- I THINK THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION IS WHEN I PRESENTED THE FINANCIAL PLAN A WEEK AGO, AN IDEA ON THE LIST IN ORDER TO BALANCE IT IN A PESSIMISTIC SCENARIO WAS TO TAKE ABOUT $500,000 OF LOCAL FUNDING AWAY. AND WE NEEDED THAT IN ORDER TO DEAL WITH THE PESSIMISTIC PROJECTIONS FOR REVENUE SHORTFALL. COUNCILMEMBER, WE HAVE A MINIMUM FUND BALANCE AND SO COUNCILMEMBER LUMM'S AMENDMENT WOULD GO BELOW THE MINIMUM AND UTILIZE THOSE FUNDS IN ORDER TO SUSTAIN WHAT WAS ORIGINALLY PLANNED FOR THAT PORTION OF WHAT WAS ORIGINALLY PLANNED.
06:27:20.926: >> Councilmember Nelson:  IS THIS ANY DOWNSIDE TO DOING THIS?
06:27:24.096: >> City Admin. Crawford: WELL, WE KEEP FUND BALANCE THERE FOR A REASON AND IN THAT PARTICULAR FUND -- I SHOULD HAVE MR. SEAN OR MR. HUPY ON HERE. SOME OF THESE FUNDS WE NEED THEM TO HAVE FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR GRANT FUNDING. CRAIG, DO YOU WANT TO RESPOND TO THIS FOR THE LOCAL STREETS FUND?
06:27:47.787: >> I DIDN'T HEAR THE QUESTION BECAUSE THEY WERE REJOINING ME INTO THE MEETING. SO I WAS AT A DEAD SPACE.
06:27:56.062: >> City Admin. Crawford: YES.
06:27:56.696: >> Councilmember Nelson: SO --
06:27:58.597: >> Councilmember Lumm: IF I MAY.
06:28:03.002: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER NELSON, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
06:28:04.370: >> Councilmember Nelson:  JANE MAY BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN IT. JANE IS PROPOSING THAT WE DIP BELOW THE RESERVE FUND THAT WE TYPICALLY KEEP AND I'M ASKING WHAT IS THE DOWN SIDE TO -- I MEAN OUR STANDARD PRACTICE IS TO MAINTAIN THE RESERVE FUND AND DIPPING BELOW, WHAT'S THE CON TO THAT?
06:28:27.760: >> Councilmember Lumm: I INCLUDED A RESOLVE CLAUSE TO ADDRESS THIS, THAT THE STAFF WOULD DEVELOP A PLAN TO RESTORE THE LONG-TERM HE WILL STREET FUND BALANCE TO THE MINIMUM REQUIRED BY CITY POLICY, BY REDUCING THE EQUIVALENT AMOUNT IN FUTURE YEARS AND THAT WAS DISCUSSED -- I -- I PRESENTED THIS IN ADVANCE TO STAFF, AND SO THEY WERE AWARE OF THIS. AND --
06:28:50.249: >> Councilmember Nelson: OKAY. SO TELL ME IF I UNDERSTAND THIS CORRECTLY. I'M SORRY SO CAUSE THIS MEETING TO GO MUCH LATER. YOU WERE JUST PROPOSING THAT WE FRONT LOAD WORK BECAUSE RIGHT NOW CARS AREN'T OUT AND IT'S LESS DESR DLESS DESRUPTIVE NOW N THERE ARE PROJECTS THAT ARE NOT TAKEN PLACE BECAUSE OF FUNDING.
06:29:19.245: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES.
06:29:19.845: >> Councilmember Nelson: OKAY. I GET IT.
06:29:21.313: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
06:29:23.182: >> Councilmember Lumm: I'M DONE?
06:29:23.983: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? MAMR. CRAWFORD.
06:29:28.587: >> City Admin. Crawford: PART OF THE REASON -- SORRY FOR THE HOUR HERE. PART OF THE REASON WE DO KEEP THAT FUND BALANCE AT THAT LEVEL, IS BECAUSE WE HAVE THE VOLATILITY AND IN THE SOURCE OF FUNDS THAT THIS COMES FROM THE WEIGHT IN GAS TAX. IF WE HAVE A CHALLENGING WEATHER EVENTS, IF THIS IS A DIFFICULT WINTER, THIS IS WHERE WE GO TO DIP INTO THE FUND BALANCE. AND THEN IF THERE IS MATCHING FUNDS NEEDED FOR STATE OR FEDERAL PROGRAMS, THAT'S ALSO WHY WE HAVE MINIMUM FUND BALANCES. THESE THINGS ALL WORK TOGETHER AND WHY WE HAVE THE MINIMUM. WHAT IT DOES ABOUT I UTILIZING SOME OF THESE RESOURCES IS IT MAKES IT, YOU KNOW, MORE CHALLENGING IF THOSE SITUATIONS ARISE.
06:30:26.512: >> Mayor Taylor: FOURTHers DISCUSSION OF THE AMENDMENT.
06:30:27.913: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  HOW FAR DOES IT TAKE US BELOW THE RECOMMENDED FUND BALANCE?
06:30:35.387: >> City Admin. Crawford: I HAVE TO CHECK WITH STAFF ON THAT ONE.
06:30:45.698: >> AND I WILL ASK LYNN OR MARTY WHERE THAT TAKES US. IF WE ARE ROUGHLY AT 5 MILLION AND WE ARE GOING DOWN $500,000, THAT'S 10% BELOW. IN ROUND, VERY ROUND NUMBERS.
06:30:57.409: >> THAT'S CORRECT.
06:31:03.182: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  AND $5 MILLION REPRESENTS WHAT? A HAPPY ANNUAL'S --
06:31:11.991: >> ANNUAL IS ABOUT 6 MILLION IN THE LOCAL STREET VALUE. SO JUST UNDER ONE YEAR'S RESERVE.
06:31:19.999: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: OKAY. THANK YOU. COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
06:31:24.236: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES, NO, I THINK THIS AMENDMENT SOUNDS GOOD BECAUSE I THINK THE ROADOR PRETTY IN SHOCKINGLY BAD CONDITION BUT I WANTED TO ASK MR. CRAWFORD AGAIN. YOU -- DID YOU JUST SAY THAT THIS ACTUALLY DOES TIE YOUR HANDS A LITTLE BIT IF YOU NEED TO DO THIS AND THAT AND DIP INTO IT IN A BAD WINTER AND ALL OF THAT? MAG YES, THAT'S WHAT THE FUND
06:31:47.059: >> City Admin. Crawford: YES, THAT'S WHAT THE FUND IS FOR. WE BUDGET FOR THE AVERAGE WINTER.
06:31:56.535: >> YES, CORRECT. YEAH.
06:31:58.737: >> City Admin. Crawford: SO IF WE HAVE A HARSH WINTER, THEN WE COME BACK TO YOU MID-YEAR AND SAY WE NEED TO USE THE FUND BALANCE.
06:32:08.213: >> City Admin. Crawford: AND IS
06:32:10.049: >> Councilmember Bannister: AND IS THERE ANY OTHER WAY? I LIKE THE IDEA OF FIXING WHAT COUNCILMEMBER LUMM IS PROPOSING, THAT WHILE THERE'S NO ONE ON THE ROADS THAT WE RUN OUT AND TRY TO FIX SOME OF THESE REALLY BAD LOOKING ROADS, BUT WHAT IS YOUR FEELING ON IT?
06:32:25.998: >> City Admin. Crawford: WELL, MEAN, IT'S A LIMITED -- IT IS A LIMITED POT OF MONEY. SO WHAT YOU SPEND TODAY, WITH YU HAVE TO RESTORE TOMORROW. MR. HUPY, DO YOU HAVE COMMENTS ON THE ABILITY TO UTILIZE IT? YOU KNOW, I MEAN -- WE WILL HAVE THE OPENING OF THE -- WE BELIEVE WE ARE GOING TO HAVE THE. OPENING OF THE ECONOMY FAIRLY SOON AND SO THERE WILL BE SOME LEVEL OF ACTIVITY. DO YOU HAVE PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS?
06:32:55.894: >> WELL, I WILL SAY THAT THIS PROPOSED USE MIGHT BE EXACTLY WHAT THE FUND BALANCE IS THERE FOR. AS THE ARE REVENUE SOURCE GOES UP AND DOWN THIS ALLOWS YOU TO USE SOME OF YOUR FUND BALANCE TO SMOOTH OUT THE WORK.
06:33:12.211: >> City Admin. Crawford: IT'S ONE OF THE THREE THINGS THAT I MENTIONED, THE MATCHING EXTRAORDINARY WINTERS AND THEN THE REVENUE SHORTFALLS AND VOLATILITY. YYOU KNOW, I HAVE A LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT -- FROM A FINANCIAL PERSPECTIVE, AND MR. HUPY, AND MARTY, MS. PRASHANT, I'M NOT SURE WHERE THE STATE WILL COME OUT IN THEIR COMMITMENT AND I FEEL LIKE THERE IS MORE RISK HERE THAN WE WOULD NORMALLY SEE. SO WE MIGHT BE HITTING A PESSIMISTIC SCENARIO IN THIS ONE.
06:34:01.493: >> YES. IT WILL BE. IT WILL DEPEND HOW FAST VEHICLE USE COMES BACK, IF IT COMES BACK.
06:34:08.534: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
06:34:11.704: >> Councilmember Lumm: NOTHING.
06:34:16.675: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] ALL OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MOTION AS AMENDED. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
06:34:29.121: >> Councilmember Lumm: I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE EMAIL ADDRESS NUMBER TWO, THE AMENDMENT REGARDING THE NIXON CORRIDOR IMPROVEMENT PROJECT.
06:34:35.928: >> Mayor Taylor: SECONDED BY? COUNCIL MEMBER GRISWOLD.
06:34:42.000: >> Councilmember Lumm: I'M SURE GETTING TIRED OF NIXON CORRIDOR PROJECT AMENDMENTS FOR ME, AND I WILL JUST SAY AS LONG AS I'M ALREADY AND THIS COMMITMENT WE MADE TO RESIDENTS ISN'T FULFILLED, YOU WILL KEEP SEEING THEM. AS A BIT OF A HISTORY LESSON, WHEN THEY APPROVED THE NIXON IN 2015 AND 2016,, THERE WERE COMMITMENTS MADE BY SEVERAL COUNCILMEMBERS AND SEE SPECIALLY MAYOR TAYLOR WHO ADDRESSED THE PROBLEMATIC CONGESTION PROBLEMS AND IT WOULD EXACERBATED BY THE NEW UNITS AND I WOULD INDICATE THAT THE PUBLIC 19 FINANCIAL IMPACTS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS ALLEGATION IS TO HAVE CITY COUNCIL REQUEST STAFF AND PLANNING COMMISSION. WE CAN'T CORRECT THE PLANNING COMMISSION TO DO THINGS BUT REQUEST THEM FOR THE RESIDENTS AS THE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PLAN IS UPDATED AND SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS AND DECISIONS ARE MADE IN PROTECTING REJECT DEFERRALS. WE HAVE THE SIMILAR BUDGET AMENDMENT A YEAR AGO BUT NOTHING CHANGED AS A RESULT OF THAT. SPECIFICALLY, THE AMENDMENT REAFFIRMS COUNCIL'S COMMITMENT TO DO THE PROJECT, AND IT ALSO ENCOURAGES STAFF AND THE PLANNING COMMISSION TO RECONSIDER ACCELERATING THE PROJECT TIMING, BUT AT A MINIMUM NOT DELAY IT ANY LONGER. IT'S NOW SCHEDULED TO START PHASE ONE IN 2025 WHICH IS TEN YEARS -- TEN YEARS AFTER THE COMMITMENT TO RESIDENTS WAS MADE. I THINK THAT'S LONG ENOUGH AND ADDITIONAL DELAYS ARE NOT FAIR TO IMPACTED RESIDENTS AND CONSISTENT WITH THE COMMITMENTS WE MADE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.
06:36:31.276: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER GRAND?
06:36:33.745: >> Councilmember Grand: I JUST DON'T REALLY THINK THIS IS A BUDGET AMENDMENT BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING TYING THE BUDGET TO THIS. IT JUST CONFIRMS THAT WE WANT TO DO IT, BUT I'M NOT REALLY SEEING THE ACTUAL ALLOCATION AND I'M NOT REALLY UNDERSTANDING WHY IT'S IN HERE.
06:36:55.701: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE STAFF COMMENT ON THAT?
06:37:01.240: >> City Admin. Crawford: SOME -- JUST A SECOND. I'M HAVING A HARD TIME CONNECTING HERE. CAN YOU HEAR ME? OKAY. SOME OF THESE BUDGET AMENDMENTS ARE A LITTLE BIT OF A BUDGET CALL ON WHETHER THEY ARE BUDGETS OR AMENDMENTS. IF THEY ARE DIRECTING US TO CHANGE THE WAY THAT WE WOULD PROGRAM FUNDS, I WAS SEEING A LINE TO THAT BEING BASICALLY A CHANGE IN HOW WE ARE GOING TO MANAGE THE BUDGET.
06:37:32.938: >> Councilmember Lumm: IF I MAY RESPOND TO COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD OR GRAND, I'M SORRY.
06:37:38.277: >> Mayor Taylor: YES, COUNCILMEMBER GRAND STILL HAS THE FLOOR.
06:37:40.178: >> Councilmember Grand: NO, I MEAN I JUST -- I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHY IT'S -- YOU KNOW, IT DOESN'T REALLY STRIKE ME AS A BUDGET AMENDMENT. THAT'S ALL.
06:37:48.186: >> Councilmember Lumm: IF I CAN HELP MAYBE.
06:37:49.521: >> Mayor Taylor: I HAVE HAYNER AND LUMM ON THE QUEUE. SO LET'S STICK WITH THE QUEUE.
06:37:55.560: >> Councilmember Grand: ALL RIGHT. IT DOESN'T -- IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER. I DON'T REALLY SEE THE POINT OTHER THAN JUST SAYING TO YOUR CONSTITUENTS LIKE, HEY --
06:38:06.438: >> Councilmember Lumm: IT WAS A BUDGET AMENDMENT LAST YEAR.
06:38:11.076: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
06:38:12.811: >> Councilmember Hayner: YEAH, THANKS. I -- I GUESS I SHARED CONFUSION AND I'M NOT THRILLED REAFFIRMING A COMMITMENT THAT I DIDN'T MAKE EVEN I RECOGNIZE THAT I REMAIN AS PART OF THE COMMITMENT OF THAT BODY IF 2025. IN 2015.THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPO ARE NOT IN FAVOR OF THESE ROUNDABOUTS. UNDERSTAND IT FROM WHERE COUNCILWOMAN LUMM IS COMING FROM. I DON'T WANT TO DRAG US THROUGH A ROLL CALL VOTE OR ANYTHING, BUT I DON'T SUPPORT THIS.
06:38:54.686: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, YOU HAVE THE QUEUE.
06:38:59.925: >> Councilmember Lumm: I'M OKAY.
06:39:02.461: >> Mayor Taylor: BANNISTER. COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
06:39:03.862: >> Councilmember Bannister: I'M SIMILARLY CONCERNED LIKE COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER THAT MAYBE IN THE NEW POSTPANDEMIC ERA TO SPEND, 5, 6, $7 MILLION -- OVER 7 MERCHAND$7 MILLION ON WHAT SOS THOUGHT WERE TOO MANY ROUNDABOUTS MAYBE -- ESPECIALLY WHEN I'M THINKING OF LIKE THE BROADWAY HILL WATER MAIN PROJECT BEING DELAYED AND I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY MILLIONS THAT ONE IS, IF MR. HUPY IS STILL HERE, MAYBE HE KNOWS OR ONE OF THE STAFF HOW MUCH THAT -- I GET HOW MUCH THE BROADWAY PROJECT WAS. BUT JANE, DID YOU WANT TO TELL ME WHY -- JUST LIKE YOU ALREADY SAID. YOU HAVE ALREADY PROMISED THIS -- WE HAD ALREADY PROMISED IT'S TAKEN FOREVER. AND --
06:40:01.553: >> Councilmember Lumm: I WILL JUST SAY WHEN WE APPROVED THESE PROJECTS, WE HEARD AT THE PUBLIC HEARINGS WHEN WE APPROVE THESE PROJECTS, THE NEIGHBORS FROM THE SECOND AND THE FIRST WARDS CAME OUT OF THE WOOD WORK AND SPOKE ENDLESSLY ABOUT THE EXISTING INADEQUATE INFRASTRUCTURE AND THEY WERE SPEAKING SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE NIXON CORRIDOR. WE THEN MADE A COMMITMENT. WE SAID, LITERALLY AT THE COUNCIL MEETING, WE HEAR YOU. WE'RE GOING TO APPROVE THIS AND WE WILL ADDRESS YOUR CONCERNS THAT YOU ARE BRINGING TO OUR ATTENTION WITH REGARD TO THE NIXON CORRIDOR. THEN THAT LATER INVOLVED INTO THE NIXON CORRIDOR IMPROVEMENT PROJECT, IN THE IS FISCAL YEAR IMPROVEMENT PLAN REFLECTS THE COST FOR CONSTRUCTION FOR 2025. I HEARD FROM A COUPLE OF WARD 2 FOLKS WOULD RECENTLY, OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS WHO WANTED THIS MOVED FORWARD AND I SAID THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE RIGHT NOW. SO THIS, AGAIN, IS JUST ASKING STAFF -- BECAUSE WE RECEIVED A MEMO ABOUT THIS RECENTLY RESPONSE TO THE BUDGET AMENDMENT. THIS WAS A BUDGET AMENDMENT LAST YEAR AND WE RECEIVED A BUDGET IN FEBRUARY IN RESPONSE TO THE BUDGET AMENDMENT AND THE FISCAL YEAR 2025 FOR PHASE ONE, WHICH IS THE HURON PARKWAY DEBLUETTE IS A LITTLE OVER $2 MILLION IN THE CIP, FISCAL YEAR 2026, 3.5, I'M ROUNDING UP FOR PHASE TWO, WHICH IS BLUETTE TO DHU VARREN. THAT'S YOUR WARD. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S HELPFUL. AND, AGAIN, IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THIS IS -- THAT IT'S ASKED -- THAT THIS WAS REAL -- THIS REALLY ASKS THE PLANNING COMMISSION AND THE STAFF TO -- TO RECONSIDER THE TIMING AND NOT DELAY IT ANY LONGER THAN PROPOSED.
06:42:28.066: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE AMENDMENT? ALL IN FAVOR? I'M SORRY --
06:42:36.908: >> Councilmember Hayner:  NO. THAT'S FINE.
06:42:39.044: >> Mayor Taylor: MY MISTAKE. ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING --
06:42:42.180: >> Councilmember Hayner:  NO, THAT'S FINE.
06:42:43.515: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I WANT A ROLL CALL VOTE.
06:42:46.218: >> Councilmember Hayner: OKAY.
06:42:52.257: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  NO.
06:42:52.857: >> Councilmember Hayner:  NO.
06:42:56.361: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES.

06:43:16.748: >> Councilmember Nelson:  NO.
06:43:22.621: >> Councilmember Smith: NO.
06:43:23.321: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION CARRIES.
06:43:25.090: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
06:43:29.327: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU. THIS AMENDMENT THREE, WHICH IS THE AMENDMENT I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE REGARDING LDAF SPARK AND LOCAL BUSINESS SUPPORT AND COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI IS A COSPONSOR.
06:43:44.576: >> Mayor Taylor: SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
06:43:47.512: >> Councilmember Lumm: AND THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI. I'M REALLY PLEASED THAT YOU ARE COSPONSORING THIS. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI IS OUR SMALL BUSINESS GUY ON COUNCIL. AND I THINK HIS VOICE IS CRITICAL ALWAYS BUT HE IS A LEADER IN -- AND A GREAT SPOKESPERSON FOR OUR LOCAL BUSINESS COMMUNITY. AND I WILL SAY THAT WHILE REST OF US CAN TALK ABOUT COVID-19 IMPACTS ON SMALL BUSINESS, HE'S LIVING IT. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI CAN BETTER SPEAK TO WHY LOCAL BUSINESS RECOVERY SUPPORT IS SO IMPORTANT AT THIS TIME. SO I WILL JUST FOCUS ON WHAT THE AMENDMENT DOES. I DO KNOW, THOUGH, THAT LOCAL BUSINESSES ARE MAJOR CONTRIBUTORS TO ANN ARBOR'S CHARACTER AND QUALITY OF LIFE AND KNOW THEY ARE STRUGGLING BASED ON MANY FOLKS I TALKED WITH. THIS AMENDMENT IS ALSO ORIENTED TOWARDS FLEXIBILITY IN DEALING WITH THE CRISIS. IN THIS CASE, THE LDFA'S FLEXIBILITY IN USING THEIR RESOURCES TO SUPPORT BUSINESS RECOVERY. SPECIFICALLY IT REQUESTS THE LDFA TALKS WITH THE MEDC, WHICH IS THEIR ENABLING ENTITY ABOUT WHAT FLEXIBILITY THERE MAY BE IN TERMS OF USING LDFA RESOURCES FOR BUSINESS RECOVERY SUPPORT. AND IF THIS IS FLEXIBILITY, TO THEN CONSIDER REALLOCATING SOME OF THEIR PROPOSED FISCAL YEAR '21 BUDGET TO THAT PURPOSE DIRECTLY OR THROUGH SPARK. THE AMENDMENT ALSO THANKS LDFA FOR THEIR COMMITMENT TO THE CITY'S FIBER PROJECT AND THANKS SPARK FOR THEIR ALREADY SIGNIFICANT EFFORTS IN HELPING OUR SMALL AND LOCAL BUSINESSES. AND FINALLY, THE AMENDMENT ASKS BOTH SPARK AND LDFA IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT THE CITY SHOULD BE DOING TO BETTER LEVERAGE THEIR EFFORTS. I HOPE WE CAN SUPPORT THIS TONIGHT AND THANK YOU FOR CONSIDERING IT AND THANK YOU AGAIN COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI FOR COSPONSORING IT.
06:45:50.602: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, FOR THOSE KIND WORDS. I APPRECIATE THE EMPATHY, AND MANY OF YOU HAVE FOR ME AND A LOT OF SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. I WILL JUST SAY THAT ALTHOUGH THIS HAVE BEEN MANY FEDERAL AND STATE PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN RELEASED AND TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS HAVE BEEN SPENT, FOLKS LIKE ME HAVEN'T RECEIVED ANYTHING. NOTHING. FORTUNATELY MY LANDLORD HAS FORGONE TWO MONTHS' WORTH OF RENT. AND SO THAT'S TAKEN THE PRESSURE OF ME, BUT I KNOW THERE'S MANY SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS WHO DON'T HAVE THE TYPE OF RELATIONSHIP I HAVE WITH MY LANDLORD. ANYHOW, MOST OF THE PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT FORTH HELP THE EMPLOYEES AND THAT'S -- THAT'S WONDERFUL. I APPRECIATE THAT. BUT THE SMALL BUSINESS OWNER RIGHT NOW IS PAYING A HEAVY PRICE. MANY ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN DESTROYED. MANY ORGANIZATIONS WILL NOT RETURN. AND IT'S THE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS WHO DONATE TO THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS, THE HIGH SCHOOLS, THE -- ALL THE OTHER CHARITIES. IT'S NOT THE BIG BOX STORES THAT GIVE TO PTOs. IT'S YOUR SMALL BUSINESS OWNER WHO CONTRIBUTES MIGHTILY TO THE LOCAL ECONOMY AND THE QUALITY OF LIFE. SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE TAKE NOTE OF THAT AND WE REMEMBER THAT'S WHY ANN ARBOR WAS CHARMING FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE BECAUSE IT DIDN'T HAVE BIG BOX STORES DOWNTOWN. IT WAS NOT FULL OF FRANCHISES, IT WAS INDEPENDENT, QUIRKY, FUNKY BUSINESSES THAT YOU DIDN'T SEE ANYWHERE ELSE, BUT IN ANN ARBOR. A LOT OF THAT HAS DISAPPEARED. SOME OF IT STILL REMAINS. BUT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE TRY TO ASSIST THOSE AND FOSTER AN ENVIRONMENT FOR THE REBIRTH OF DOWNTOWN. AND I'M TASKED WITH A PRETTY SIZABLE RESPONSIBILITY WITH BEING ON THE LDFA AND THE DEDICATED TAX DOLLARS THEY RECEIVE HAVE VERY RESTRICTIVE USES THE MDEC IS THERE IN ALL OF OUR MEETINGS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN ANSWER OUR QUESTIONS AND APPLY THE MONEY WHERE THE BOARD THINKS IS MOST APPROPRIATE. WE DO HAVE A HEALTHY FUND BALANCE. AND THERE ARE CHANGES IN PROGRAMMING AS THIS RESOLUTION CALLS FOR THE $300,000 IN SPECIAL EVENTS. THEY ARE TWO MAJOR EVENTS THAT WILL NOT HAPPEN THIS YEAR. AND ONE IS THE AUTO SHOW AND THE OTHER IT TECH TREK. SO WITH THE CANCELLATION OF MAJOR EVENTS, PERHAPS THE MDEC WILL SEE THAT THIS IS A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO HELP IN WAYS THAT OTHER TIMES WOULD BE PROHIBITED. PLUS THE GRANTS, THE $300,000 THAT THE LDFA IS ALLOWED TO GIVE A QUALIFIED, EQUAL APPLIED. SO SORRY BE TO LONGWINDED AT 1:30 IN THE MORNING. I NO HE THAT COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER -- I NO KNOW THAT COUNCIL MEMBER HAYNER AND I HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS IN PAST AND HOW WE CAN EMPOWER SPARK AND LDFA TO SUPPORT OUR LOCAL BUSINESSES AND I'M TRYING TO BE THE CHAMPION THERE TO GET THE MONEY TO THE LOCAL DOWNTOWN SMALL BUSINESSES.
06:49:59.684: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] ALL OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE BUM ETBUDGETAS AMENDED. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
06:50:18.736: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANKS, MR. MAYOR. OOPS. I CLICKED OFF OF IT. SO AMENDMENT FOUR AND TO THINK IT TOOK A PANDEMIC TO GET THIS BEFORE US. IT'S TO REDUCE THE DEER CULL FUNDING AND FUNDING FOR OTHER NOTIONS. IF YOU READ THE AMENDMENT, IT HAS A -- I WANT TO CHANGE THE FIRST RESOLVE CLAUSE. RESOLVE THAT THE CITY COUNCIL REDUCE THE FUNDING FOR THE DEER CULL TO $70,000 AND I ACTUALLY WANT TO REDUCE THAT TO ZERO. NOW, I -- THERE WERE SOME IDEAS THAT CAME FORWARD FROM SOME ADVOCATES FOR ALTERNATIVE METHODS FOR DEER CONTROL THAT WE LOOKED AT COST AT AROUND MAYBE $75,000, BUT WHEN I SEE HOW LITTLE WE ARE GOING TO HAVE MOVING FORWARD, AND I SEE COMING UP IN THE NEXT BUDGET AMENDMENT, A NEED FOR -- OR THE OPPORTUNITY OFFERED TO POSTPONE HISTORIC DISTRICT SURVEY OF $40,000. I WOULD MUCH RATHER REDUCE THAT TO ZERO AND $70,000 AND HELP AMENDMENT THE UPCOMING BUDGET AMENDMENT TO PUT THE HISTORIC DISTRICT SURVEY BACK IN. AND SO IT'S AS YOU SEE IT, BUT INSTEAD OF  $70,000, I WOULD LIE TO TAKE IT TO ZERO.
06:51:40.218: >> Mayor Taylor: LET'S DO THIS. IS THERE A SECOND? YOU DON'T NEED TO -- THE AMENDMENT HAS BEEN PRESENTED -- WELL, BECAUSE BUDGET AMENDMENTS ARE TYPICALLY GIVEN FAR IN ADVANCE, WITH YOUR PERMISSION, WHAT I WILL DO IS I WILL ASK YOU TO PRESENT IT AS WAS, AND THEN SEEK TO AMENDMENT IT ON THE FLOOR. I SUSPECT WE WILL LET YOU DO THAT AS A MATTER OF COURTESY. SO IS THERE A SECOND ON THE AMENDMENT AS WAS? AS WRITTEN? SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER NELSON. THERE'S AN AMENDMENT -- A PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO. REDUCE THE DEER CULL FUNDING IN THE AMENDMENT TO ZERO. IS THERE A SECOND TO THAT AMENDMENT TO THE AMENDMENT (SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER. IS THAT FRIENDLY? FRIENDLY. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, YOU STILL HAVE THE FLOOR. THE AMENDMENT IS ALTERED. SO THAT THE GENERAL FUND BUDGET REDUCTION FOR DEER CULL IS TO ZERO.
06:52:37.909: >> Councilmember Hayner: OKAY. SO WHAT YOU SEE IN THERE IS THAT THERE'S OTHER PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN MOVING AROUND AT THE CITY, ONE OF THEM IS THE -- THE TREE LINE TRAIL PROJECT. IT HAD $40,000, AND THE CENTER OF CITY HAD $20,000. WE ACTUALLY HAD ABOUT 135 AND WE DIDN'T USE IT. I SAY WE ALLOT $40,000 TO EACH OF THOSE PROJECTS ONE THAT IS -- SOME MIGHT SAY IS MANDATED BY THE SAX PAYERS THAT KEEP MOVING FORWARD AND -- TAXPAYERS THAT KEEP MOVING FORWARD AND OTHERS THAT WE MADE CERTAIN COMMITMENTS TO. I THINK IT'S A REASONABLE TRADEOFF IN THESE TRYING TIMES AND I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT.
06:53:22.520: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE AMENDMENT AS AMENDED. COUNCILMEMBER EATON?
06:53:27.859: >> Councilmember Eaton: THANK YOU. I'M A STRONG SUPPORTER OF THE DEER CULL OF THE CENTER OF THE CITY AND THE TREELINE, BUT OUR CURRENT BUDGET, I DON'T KNOW REALLY GIVES US THIS FLEXIBILITY. I WOULD BE WILLING TO CUT ALL THREE OF THOSE, BECAUSE WE NEED TO COME UP WITH ABOUT $10 MILLION WORTH OF CUTS. I DON'T THINK THERE ARE ANY SACRED COWS IN THE BUDGET AT THIS POINT IN TIME, AND CERTAINLY AS MUCH AS I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAINTAIN OUR MAINTENANCE OF THE DEER POPULATION, I'M WILLING TO ELIMINATE IT ENTIRELY, BUT I DON'T WANT TO MOVE THAT MONEY AROUND. I WANT TO APPLY IT TO THE BALANCE THAT WE HAVE. AND SO I WOULD RATHER NOT SUPPORT THIS AMENDMENT AND HAVE THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR BRING BACK HIS IDEAS AS TO WHAT WE SHOULD CUT AND I HOPE THAT YOU WOULD CONSIDER ALL THREE OF THESE THINGS. BUT --
06:54:28.386: >> Mayor Taylor: PERHAPS YOUR GOAL COULD BE AFFECTED BY AN AMENDMENT TO THE AMENDMENT TO ELIMINATE THE FINAL RESOLVE CLAUSE.
06:54:40.698: >> Councilmember Eaton: SURE.
06:54:41.432: >> Mayor Taylor: IS FROM A SECOND. SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER NELSON. DISCUSSION OF THE AMENDMENT TO THE AMENDMENT. IS THE AMENDMENT TO THE AMENDMENT FRIENDLY? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, YOU ARE ON MUTE.
06:54:54.211: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YOU KNOW, NOT AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED. I --
06:54:58.149: >> Mayor Taylor: VERY WELL. ALL RIGHT. I HAVE ON THE QUEUE BANNISTER, GRAND, HAYNER.
06:55:07.658: >> Councilmember Bannister:  I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY THAT I WOULD BE IN A LOT OF BIG TROUBLE WITH THE WARD ONE CONSTITUENTS IF I DEFUNDED THE DEER CULL, BUT I DO SUPPORT THE CENTER OF THE CITY AND THE TREELINE ALSO VERY MUCH AND I THINK THAT THOSE LITTLE AMOUNTS ARE LIKE THE SEED CORN OF THE RECOVERY. THEY GIVE THE CENTERS COMMONS AREA AND SOMETHING TO LOOK UP AND FORWARD TO. SO I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN FIND MONEY FOR ALL THREE OF THESE PROGRAMS. THANK YOU.
06:55:52.169: >> Mayor Taylor: CAN YOU SUGGEST THAT ALL OF US PRETTY MUCH KNOW HOW WE ARE GOING TO VOTE ON COUNCILMEMBER EATON'S RESOLUTION WITH RESPECT TO THE FINAL RESOLVE. CAN WE RUN IT FOR A VOTE? DOES ANYBODY HAVE ANY OBJECTION TO THAT?
06:56:07.318: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: CLARIFICATION. WE ARE REMOVING THE FINAL RESOLVE CLAUSE?
06:56:13.724: >> Mayor Taylor: THAT'S CORRECT.
06:56:15.092: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:
06:56:15.626: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  AND THAT'S WHAT THE VOTE IS ON?
06:56:19.163: >> Mayor Taylor: THAT'S CORRECT. ROLL CALL VOTE -- COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, YOU WISH TO SPEAK ON THIS?
06:56:24.635: >> Councilmember Lumm: SORRY, I JUST -- ALL OF THESE THINGS WERE ON MR. CRAWFORD'S LIST. SO I WILL SUPPORT THIS. AS YOU KNOW, I HAVE BEEN A LEADER ON DEER MANAGEMENT. AND I KNOW IT'S IMPORTANT TO OUR SECOND WARD R RESIDENTS.
06:56:53.764: >> Mayor Taylor: IS UNRELATED TO DEER. IT'S JUST RELATED TO THE -- IT'S THE FINAL RESOLVE CLAUSE?
06:57:01.038: >> Councilmember Lumm: YOU ARE REMOVING THE FINAL RESOLVE CLAUSE?
06:57:04.575: >> Mayor Taylor: THAT'S RIGHT. UNLESS ANYONE WISHES TO SPEAK ABOUT REMOVING THE FINAL RESOLVE CLAUSE, LET'S RUN A VOTE ON REMOVING THE FINAL RESOLVE CLAUSE. THE FINAL IS IF THERE'S A REDUCTION OF THE DEER CULL FUNDING THAT THERE WOULD BE NO REALLOCATION OF THOSE FUNDS AND THAT THEY WOULD GO STRAIGHT INTO THE GENERAL FUND. IS EVERYBODY CLEAR. THANK YOU. ROLL CALL VOTE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
06:57:30.801: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES.
06:57:34.572: >> Councilmember Hayner:  NO.
06:57:36.874: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES.
06:57:40.945: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES.
06:57:49.954: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES.
06:57:50.888: >> Councilmember Grand: YES.
06:57:51.489: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES.
06:57:56.560: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
06:57:57.061: >> Councilmember Nelson:  YES.
06:58:00.898: >> Councilmember Smith: YES. MOTION CARRIES.
06:58:03.234: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE AMENDMENT AS AMENDED. I'M SORRY. I HAVE A QUEUE. IT WAS BANNISTER, GRAND, HAYNER, LUMM. COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
06:58:16.647: >> Councilmember Bannister: I'M ALL SET.
06:58:19.984: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
06:58:22.820: >> Councilmember Grand: GOOD. TAKEN COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
06:58:24.021: >> Councilmember Hayner: WHERE DO WE STAND HERE? YOU HAVE SUCCESSFULLY DEFUNDED ALL THREE OF THESE IF WE VOTE YES ON THIS OR THE CENTER OF THE CITY STILL GETS 20 AND THE TREELINE GETS FORWARD? IS THAT WHAT I'M SEEING HERE?
06:58:38.736: >> City Admin. Crawford: YES. AND THE RECOMMENDED -- PAYER, MAY I?
06:58:44.508: >> Mayor Taylor: PLEASE.
06:58:45.042: >> Councilmember Hayner: PLEASE.
06:58:46.143: >> City Admin. Crawford: YOU WOULD HAVE DEFUNDED $140,000 FOR THE DEER CULL. THERE'S STILL $40,000 FOR THE TREELINE AND STILL $20,000 IN FOR CENTER OF THE CITY. YOU ARE NOT ADDING THE 20.
06:59:15.306: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
06:59:20.077: >> Councilmember Hayner: PRIOR TO THE DRASTIC CUT, THE CENTER OF THE CITY MADE A CONSCIENCE EFFORT TO NOT SPEND ALL THE MONEY THAT WAS ALLOTTED TO US SO WE COULD SUPPORT THE PROGRAMS MOVING FORWARD. AND TREE LINE, WHAT WE HAVE -- THE ALIGNMENT STUDIES OR WHAT ARE FLOATING OUT THERE, AND SO THAT'S WHAT'S LEFT. THE TREELINE HAS DONE ALL KINDS OF PERSONAL FUND-RAISING, BUT IT'S A PRIVATE PROJECT, EVEN THOUGH THE ALLEN GR CREEK ALIGNMENT, THE TREE LINE, THEY HAVE DONE THEIR OWN THING AND FURTHERMORE IT DOESN'T HAVE THE -- YOU KNOW IT DOESN'T HAVE THE VOTER MANDATE BEHIND IT LIKE THE CENTER OF THE CITY DID. IT WASN'T A CHARTER CHANGE REQUIRING US TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS PROJECT AND SO, YOU KNOW, WE CAN MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS PROJECT BUT THE NOTION OF PRETSPLITTING THE TWO EQUALLY WS BIASED THAT WE HAVE A STAFF PERSON WHO HAD SERVED BOTH OF THOSE FUNCTIONS ADMIRABLY IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR, AND I HOPED WOULD TICK CONTINUE TO DO SO INE UPCOMING BUDGET YEAR. AND THAT'S WHERE THIS AMENDMENT REALLY COMES FROM. THE EXPECTATION THAT MOST OF THIS WOULD BE DEDICATED TO STAFF TIME, TO KEEP THOSE PROJECTS FLOATING FORWARD KIND OF FOR THE COMMON GOOD. SO I'M DISAPPOINTED THAT, YOU KNOW, THE CENTER CITY IS GOING TO GET SHORT END OF THE STICK ON THIS ONE, WHEN WE ARE THE ONES WHO DIDN'T SPEND ALL OF OUR MONEY LAST CYCLE AND I RECOGNIZE IF YOU DON'T USE IT, YOU LOSE IT. AND THAT'S HOW BUSINESSES WORK. I'M DISAPPOINTED IN THIS OUTCOME. THAT'S YOU WIL ALL I WOULD LIKEY ABOUT THAT.
07:01:08.986: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
07:01:10.020: >> Councilmember Lumm: AS YOU ALL KNOW, THE STAFF FINANCIAL RECOVER REPLAN INCLUDED DEFERRING THE CULL AND SAVING THE $440,000 AND AS MUCH AS I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THAT WOULD BE WISE, IT -- I'M CONVINCED IT WILL JUST COST US MORE LATER. I RECOGNIZE THAT WE DO HAVE TO MAKE HARD CHOICES. AND IF MR. CRAWFORD AND STAT OF BELIEVE THE DEER CULL NEEDS TO BE DEFERRED FOR A YEAR, I WON'T GET IN THE WAY OF THAT. AND, YOU KNOW, I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE GIVEN THE SITUATION THAT WE ARE NOW IN, AND, AGAIN, I'M COMFORTABLE LEAVING THAT DECISION TO STAFF. WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT IT WILL LIKELY MEAN HIGHER COSTS IN THE FUTURE. BUT IT'S -- IT'S ONE OF THE MANY DECISIONS THAT -- THAT MUST BE MADE, GIVEN WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT OUR FINANCIAL CHALLENGES.
07:02:09.213: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
07:02:10.447: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I JUST HAVE A QUESTION FOR MR. CRAWFORD WHICH MIGHT SEEM AWKWARD. WE HAD A CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS, AS EVERYONE DOES WITH THEIR BUDGET AMENDMENTS AND DO YOU ANTICIPATE THAT THE CRUSHING OF THIS BUDGET AMENDMENT IS GOING TO HAVE AN EFFECT ON
07:02:23.327: >> City Admin. Crawford: DEFUNDI NG THE DEER PROGRAM OR UNDERFUNDING THE CENTER OF THE CITY.
07:02:40.778: >> City Admin. Crawford:  NO, NR AMOUNTS.
07:02:43.614: >> Councilmember Hayner: THESE ARE THE NICKELS WE GET TO ARGUE WITH WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. SO IF THIS OF MOVES FORWARD THIS 20,000, THAT'S IN THERE, WILL THAT BE ALLOWED TO PARTICIPATE AS -- BE TAKEN OUT OF STAFF TIME, MR. CRAWFORD OR WHAT DO YOU THINK WE'LL GET TO SPEND THAT MONEY ON.
07:03:03.534: >> City Admin. Crawford: WELL, MR. DELACOURT IS HERE. HE MAY MAY BE ABLE TO ARTICULATE THE OTHER THINGS THAT THIS EMPLOYEE IS INVOLVED IN. IF SHE'S NOT NEEDED OR UTILIZED IN THIS, THERE'S GENERALLY ENOUGH WORK TO GO AROUND. PGH >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER OKAY. THIS IS NOT AN EFFORT TO MAINTAIN POINTING IT AT A -- THERE'S NO EMPLOYEE BIAS. MY UNDERSTANDING WAS SHARING THESE TASKS THAT IT MIGHT ALLOW THEM BOTH TO MOVE FORWARD IN A MORE EFFICIENT PANNER. I GUESS THAT WAS MY INTENTION AROUND THIS RESOLUTION, NOT ONLY TO CUT THE FUNDING THAT WAS RECOMMENDED FROM THE DEER CULL BUT TO PRESERVE THIS -- THESE COMMUNITY PROJECTS THAT WE HAVE BEEN, YOU KNOW, CHARGED BY THE VOTERS TO CARRY FORWARD AND OBVIOUSLY COMMITMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE FOR BOTH THE TREELINE AND THE CENTER OF THE CITY, AND, YOU KNOW, I JUST HOPE TO SEE THEM EVEN PARTIALLY PUT FORWARD.
07:04:05.596: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
07:04:22.713: >> Councilmember Griswold: GRISWOLD. I'M FINE.
07:04:29.620: >> Clerk Beaudry: ROLL CALL?
07:04:31.154: >> Mayor Taylor: ROLL CALL VOTE STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI. IS HE ON?
07:04:41.431: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I DON'T ACTUALLY SEE HIM. I DON'T SEE HIM ON MY SCREEN.
07:04:55.579: >> Clerk Beaudry: I'M RETURNING HIM. HE MUST HAVE DROPPED OFF AND CAME BACK IN.
07:04:59.049: >> Councilmember Hayner:  JUST SO I UNDERSTAND BECAUSE OF THE AMENDMENT, IF THIS -- IF THIS AMENDMENT PASSES, WE HAVE ZEROED OUT THE DEER FUNDING AND WE ARE GIVING 20 TO THE CENTER AND 40 TO THE TREELINE, WHATEVER THAT MONEY IS GOING TO BE USED FOR.
07:05:19.770: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, WE ARE READY TO VOTE. YOU DROPPED OFF. DO YOU NEED TO GET IN.
07:05:25.909: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I LEFT WHEN THE LAST RESOLVE CLAUSE. THIS IS ON THE MAIN MOTION, THE WHOLE THING?
07:05:35.218: >> Mayor Taylor: THE MAIN MOTION.
07:05:36.086: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  IT PUTS 20,000 IN THE CITY OF THE CENTER AND 40,000 TO TREE LINE AND ZERO TO DEER CULL.
07:05:45.729: >> Mayor Taylor: CORRECT.
07:05:46.296: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I'M READY.
07:05:48.031: >> Mayor Taylor: ROLL CALL VOTE WITH COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
07:05:51.234: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  NO.

07:06:29.773: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE BUDGET AS AMENDED. COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
07:06:34.678: >> Councilmember Eaton: I WOULD OFFER AMENDMENT FIVE, AN AMENDMENT TO POS POSTPONE FOR TE HISTORIC DISTRICT SURVEY AND THE CAPITAL SINKING FUND TRANSFER FOR FISCAL YEAR 2021.
07:06:49.226: >> Mayor Taylor: SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN. COUNCILMEMCOUNCILMEMBER EATON, L HAVE THE FLOOR.
07:06:57.834: >> Councilmember Eaton: I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY, IT'S JUST OTHER THINGS WE CAN CUT IN OUR ATTEMPT TO BALANCE OUR BUDGET.
07:07:06.109: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER SMITH.
07:07:09.413: >> Councilmember Smith: I HAD A BRIEF CONVERSATION ON HOLLYWOOD DRIVE FOLLOWING THE PROJECT INITIATION DESIGN MEETING THE OTHER NIGHT. CONSIDERING THE SITUATION WHILE THIS WAS A CITIZEN INITIATED PROJECT, THERE IS REAL CONCERN ABOUT THEIR ABILITY TO COVER THE ASSESSED COSTS. THEY HAVE ASKED TO -- OR AT LEAST SEVERAL OF THEM HAVE ASKED US TO GO AHEAD AND DEFER THIS PROJECT FOR THE TIME BEING.
07:07:41.912: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
07:07:44.915: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANKS. I -- YEAH, THESE WERE ITEMED, AGAIN, FROM MR. CRAWFORD'S RECOVERY PLAN LIST, TO AMENDMENT THE BUDGET BOARD. I SUPPORT IT. THEY SEEM LIKE MORE NONCONTROVERSIAL ACTIONS WITH NO REAL ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES, WHICH IS WHY MR. CRAWFORD HAD THEM, I BELIEVE ON THE RECOVERY PLAN LIST AND WALKED US THROUGH THEM ON MAY 11th. I APPRECIATE WHAT COUNCILMEMBER SMITH JUST SHARED. IN TERMS OF THE FOLKS REGARDING THE HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD.
07:08:23.120: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
07:08:24.020: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. I WANTED TO SHARE A LITTLE BIT MORE ON THAT AS WELL. I HAVE RECEIVED SOME EMAILS FROM RESIDENTS WHO INITIATED THIS PROJECT WHO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE ASSESSMENTS AND THEIR ABILITY TO AFFORD THIS. AND SO AS A BOARD REMEMBER, I HAVE NO PROBLEM IN SUPPORTING THIS AND POSTPONING THIS CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECT.
07:08:59.990: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
07:09:00.891: >> Councilmember Bannister: I'M FINE WITH ALL OF THESE EXCEPT THE HISTORIC SURVEY. ISN'T THAT THE REALLY IMPORTANT SURVEY WHERE WE IDENTIFY HISTORIC PROPERTIES AND GET THEM PROTECTED AND THEY CURRENTLY AREN'T PROTECTED?
07:09:14.871: >> City Admin. Crawford: I WILL ASK MR. DELACOURT TO SPEAK ON, THIS IF I COULD.
07:09:24.981: >> MORNING.
07:09:27.884: >> Mayor Taylor: MORNING.
07:09:28.451: >> TO BEST ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, IT IS NOT TO NECESSARILY SURVEY NEW PROPERTIES. THIS IS THE CITY CONSIDERED BY THE STATE PRESERVATION OFFICE TO BE THE CERTIFIED LOCAL GOVERNMENT THAT THE DESIGNATION THE CITY GIVES DOCTOR OR THE STATE GIVES TO SPECIFIC MUNICIPAL DES WHO ORDINANCE AND PROCESS MIRRORS THEIR REQUIREMENTS TOX DO THAT EVERY SO OFTEN, YOU DO HAVE TO DO SURVEYS OF YOUR EXISTING PROJECTS TO MAKE SURE ALL OF YOUR INFORMATION AND DATA IS UP TO DATE AND ALL OF YOUR EXISTING PROPERTIES TO MAKE SURE THAT THE DISTRICTS AND THOSE PROPERTIES QUALIFY FOR DESIGNATION. SO TO MAIN TAPE THAT DESIGNATION, YOU DO HAVE TO DO THIS SURVEY WORK EVERY SO OFTEN, EVERY FEW YEARS. PRIMARILY ONCE A DECADE. THE CITY IS DUE TO DO THIS WORK. SO AT SOME POINT OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS WE NEED TO DO THIS WORK TO MAINTAIN THAT CERTIFICATION. IT MAKES US ELIGIBLE FOR GRANT FUNDING THROUGH THE STATE HISTORIC PRESERVATION OFFICE. IT IS IMPORTANT, BUT THAT WAS A VERY LONG WAY OF ANSWERING YOUR QUESTION. IT IS NOT NECESSARILY TO ESTABLISH NEW HISTORIC COMMITTEES AND DESIGNATE NEW PROPERTIES. THAT'S NOT INTENT OF THE FUNDS.
07:10:44.194: >> Councilmember Bannister: THAT WAS HELPFUL. THANK YOU. AND I DO THINK THAT THAT THAT DS SOUND IMPORTANT BECAUSE PART OF OUR CARBON NEUTRALITY IS WEATHERIZE AND SAVE OUR EXISTING BUILDINGS AND THERE'S A LOT OF GREAT HISTORIC BUILDINGS WHO ARE AESTHETIC PLEASING TOO. SO I HOPE WE WILL -- WOULD ANYONE LIKE TO -- IF I STRIKE THAT RESOLVE CLAUSE, THAT FOURTH RESOLVE CLAUSE ABOUT THE STRIKING THE HISTORIC DISTRICT SURVEY?
07:11:31.708: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  I WILL GIVE IT A SHOUT.
07:11:35.412: >> Mayor Taylor: SECONDED BY HAYNER.
07:11:37.981: >> Councilmember Hayner: SURE.
07:11:40.483: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER, YOU STILL HAVE THE FLOOR.
07:11:41.918: >> Councilmember Bannister: WELL, WE ARE LEARNING A NEW WORD THIS YEAR FOR MANY OF US IS EMBODIED CARBON AND THAT'S ALL THE COSTS THAT GO INTO MAKING NEW BUILDINGS FROM START TO FINISH. AND SO HISTORIC BUILDINGS THERE'S LOT TO BE SAID ABOUT SAVING THEM AND WEATHERIZING THEM FOR ALL KINDS OF REASONS THAT THEY FIT NICELY IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT. THEY HAVE BEEN HERE AND THEY ARE ESTABLISHED AND THEY HAVE NATURAL FEATURES SURROUNDING THEM. I WOULD ASK THAT $40,000 IS NOT A LOT OF MONEY. WE GET A BIG BANG FOR OUR BUCK TO PROTECT AND SUPPORT HISTORIC PRESERVATION ALL OVER THE STATE OF MICHIGAN.
07:12:40.010: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
07:12:41.611: >> Councilmember Hayner: MR. DELACOURT, WHILE WE HAVE YOU ON THE SCREEN WHAT IS THE DEAD LINE REFEWI RENEWING THIS SURVE?
07:12:54.324: >> NO, IT'S NOT IMMINENT. WE ARE DUE TO GET THE WORK DONE. THERE'S NOT A DROP DEAD DEADLINE. DEFERRING WILL NOT ELIMINATE OUR WAY TO STAY DESIGNATION.
07:13:11.007: >> Councilmember Hayner:  BUT SOME POINT --
07:13:12.709: >> IT DOESN'T EXPIRE. WE RUN THE RISK OF NOT BEING IN COMPLIANCE WITH THAT DESIGNATION, WHICH AT THAT POINT THIS CONSIDER ELIMINATION. IT DOESN'T EXPIRE OR NO DATE OF EXPERTATION BUT IF THEY DETERMINE THAT THE WORK OR THE SURVEY WORK WE HAVE DONE AND THE PROPERTIES AND THE INFORMATION WE HAVE IS NOT YOU H UP TO DATEY MAY CEASE TO RECOGNIZE OUR CERTIFICATION.
07:13:38.501: >> Councilmember Hayner:  IS THIS SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD CONSIDER NECESSARY TO WANT TO HAVE DONE IN A THE RESULTS TO BE CURRENT IF WE MOVE INTO A MASTER PLAN PROCESS.
07:13:50.747: >> IT DOESN'T HURT, BUT IT'S NOT NECESSARY TO HAVE IT UP TO DATE FOR THE MASTER PLAN PROCESS. THISES MORE TO MAKE SURE -- IT MORE IMPACTS THE HISTORIC DISTRICT AND THE PROPERTY OWNERS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE ON THOSE PROPERTIES HASN'T CHANGED THEIR DESIGNATION OR LESSONED THE VALUE OF THE DISTRICT, WHICH WOULD CAUSE THEM TO FALL OUT OF COMPLIANCE AND POTENTIALLY HURT THE ABILITY FOR THOSE PROPERTY OWNERS TO BE PART OF THAT PROGRAM GOING FORWARD. BUT IT WOULD NOT OUR ABILITY TO DO THE MASTER PLAN.
07:14:34.924: >> Councilmember Hayner:  IT DOESN'T JEOPARDIZE --
07:14:38.461: >> IF WE WERE NO LONGER A CERTIFIED LOCAL GOVERNMENT, IT COULD HURT GRANT OPPORTUNITIES. THAT IS POSSIBLE.
07:14:45.702: >> Councilmember Hayner: OKAY. I'M TRYING TO GET A HANDLE ON THE URGENCY IS OF IT. THAT'S ALL.
07:14:51.141: >> IT IS IMPORTANT, BUT IT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARILY HAS TO BE DONE IN FISCAL 21 EITHER.
07:15:00.583: >> Councilmember Hayner:  AND IF YOU SAW THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD DROP OUT OF IT, IT WOULD BE BROUGHT FORWARD PERHAPS OUT OF BUDGET AS AN AMENDMENT OR SO ON?
07:15:08.458: >> YES, ABSOLUTELY. IF THIS BECAME AN INSTANCE WHERE WE WERE AT RISK OF LOSING OUR CERTIFICATION, WE WOULD BE BACK ASKING FOR THE FUNDS AS PART OF AN AMENDMENT.
07:15:19.102: >> Councilmember Hayner: TRYING TO GET A GRIP ON URGE SENSEY.
07:15:25.308: >> YEP, KNOW, THAT'S ACCURATE.
07:15:28.344: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE AMENDMENT? ROLL CALL VOTE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI. THIS IS THE AMENDMENT TO REMOVE THE HISTORIC DISTRICT'S STUDY BY PUTTING IT BACK TOO TO THE BUDG. THIS IS ALSO A BOOKKEEPING. WOULD THE WHEREAS CLAUSE BE STRUCT.
07:15:54.304: >> Mayor Taylor: IT WAS NOT PART OF THE AMENDMENT.
07:15:56.172: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I GUESS IT WOULD BE A SORE THEM IN THERE IF WE DIDN'T --
07:16:03.580: >> Mayor Taylor: YEAH. ROLL CALL VOTE. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
07:16:05.949: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  NO.
07:16:12.722: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES.
07:16:18.628: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES.
07:16:19.462: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES.
07:16:28.705: >> Councilmember Lumm: NO.
07:16:30.740: >> Councilmember Grand: NO.
07:16:31.341: >> Councilmember Ackerman: NO.
07:16:37.180: >> Mayor Taylor: NO.
07:16:39.282: >> Councilmember Eaton: NO.
07:16:40.250: >> Councilmember Nelson:  NO.
07:16:44.687: >> Councilmember Smith: NO.
07:16:45.288: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION FAILS.
07:16:46.623: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE AMENDMENT? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? THE AMENDMENT IS APPROVED. UNLESS I'M MISTAKEN, THERE'S NO ADDITIONS TO THE BUDGET, AM I CORRECT?
07:17:16.052: >> City Admin. Crawford: JUST ONE SECOND.
07:17:17.720: >> Mayor Taylor: THAT'S MY POINT. IF THERE ARE NO ADDITIONS. --
07:17:23.192: >> City Admin. Crawford: THE BASE BUDGET HAD ADDITIONS THAT WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN ABOUT $200,000 OR SO. WE STILL NEED TO CALCULATE THE NUMBERS.
07:17:30.566: >> Mayor Taylor: ALL RIGHT.
07:17:36.205: >> City Admin. Crawford: JACKIE, THEY SHOULD BE TO YOU MOMENTARILY.
07:17:43.146: >> Councilmember Grand: IF THAT'S THE CASE, THEN JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CONTINUE TO FOLLOW THIS PRACTICE, I'M GOING TO BRING FORWARD AMENDMENT SIX, WHICH IS THE PARKS RESOLUTION THAT HAS BEEN A LONG STANDING PRACTICE OF COUNCIL. THAT SAID, I HAVE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR PARKS MANAGER.
07:18:04.467: >> Mayor Taylor: LET'S GET IT ON THE FLOOR FIRST. MOVED BY GRAND, SECONDED BY -- I'M SORRY. NELSON. COUNCILMEMBER GRAND YOU STILL HAVE THE FLOOR.
07:18:13.309: >> Councilmember Grand: AS I WAS SAYING, I HAVE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR PARKS MANAGER RISING THAT EVEN IF WE DO GO FORWARD WITH THIS, THAT WHAT GETS PUT BACK IN MAY BE TAKEN OUT. PARKS WITH THE CANCELLATION OF THEIR SUMMER CAMP PROGRAMS, I KNOW, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT'S GOING TO BE ABOUT A $400,000 PLUS HIT. TO THE PARKS' BUDGET WITH THE DECISION TO DO THAT AND THERE'S SOME OTHER HITS FROM, FOR EXAMPLE, CLOSING POOLS. SO I HAVE THINK IT COULD BE LEFT UP FOR DISCUSSION, BUT I HOPE THAT WE'LL MAIN THAIN THIS PRACTICE BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN A LONGSTANDING PRACTICE OF COUNCIL.
07:19:02.191: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION?
07:19:08.598: >> Councilmember Eaton: DO WE HAVE AN AMOUNT YET?
07:19:11.334: >> Mayor Taylor: NOT YET.
07:19:12.168: >> City Admin. Crawford: MAY I GET A CLARIFICATION AS THE AMOUNTS ARE COMING IN SO THIS RESOLUTION AS WRITTEN WAS MODIFIED FROM THE STANDARD RESOLUTION TO SAY THE PARKS FAIRNESS RESOLUTION WOULD NOT BE DONE THIS YEAR BUT IT WOULD BE REINITIATED THIS YEAR. I WANT TO UNDERSTAND COUNCILMEMBER'S GRAND'S --
07:19:34.056: >> Councilmember Grand: THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN WHAT I SAW ORIGINALLY, BUT, OKAY. THAT'S WHAT I GUESS I DISCUSSED WITH -- YEAH.
07:19:41.330: >> City Admin. Crawford: IT WAS -- AT LEAST THE VERSION I'M LOOKING AT AND I THOUGHT THE ONE THAT WE HAD MAILED --
07:19:47.470: >> Councilmember Grand: MY APOLOGIES. DIFFERENT DISCUSSION THAN I HAD, BUT -- AS LONG AS AS LONG AS WE BRING IT BACK, I'M OKAY WITH THAT.
07:19:59.582: >> City Admin. Crawford: SO MS. BEAUDRY, THERE'S $114,000 USE OF FUND BALANCE THAT WOULD BE PROVIDED TO PARKS IN A NORMAL YEAR WHEN THIS RESOLUTION WOULD COME UP FOR CONSIDERATION. IF YOU PASSED IT. SO SO THIS AMENDMENT WE CAN CHANGE IT TO YOUR INTENT BUT YOU WOULD GET $114,000 BUT THIS YEAR WE ARE NOT GOING TO DO IT.
07:20:27.610: >> Councilmember Grand: I THINK THAT MATCHES THE INITIAL INTENT, JUST WITH THE CLOSURE OF THE CAMPS AND SUCH THIS SUMMER, I THINK THERE'S GOING -- YOU KNOW, IT WILL BE A FUTURE DISCUSSION, I GUESS, WHAT KIND OF SUPPORT THEY WILL NEED.
07:20:47.964: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? I GUESS WE DON'T HAVE A NUMBER YET, DO WE?
07:20:53.135: >> City Admin. Crawford: IT JUST WENT TO MS. BEAUDRY.
07:20:58.708: >> Clerk Beaudry: I FORWARDED IT. IT'S $114,000.
07:21:03.713: >> Mayor Taylor: MOVED AND SECONDED BY RAMLAWI. THAT'S FRIENDLY, I ASSUME. VERY GOOD. FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE AMENDMENT. ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED?
07:21:26.202: >> City Admin. Crawford: MAYOR, CAN I GET CLARIFICATION ON NOT THIS LAST AMENDMENT BUT THE ONE PRIOR WITH THE -- I MEAN YOUR DISCUSSION AROUND THE HISTORIC PRESERVATION DISTRICT, WAS THAT INCLUDED OR NOT INCLUDED?
07:21:40.316: >> Mayor Taylor: IT WAS AN EFFORT TO REMOVE THAT FROM THE AMENDMENT -- THE AMENDMENT PROVIDED FOR THE REMOVAL OF THE SURVEY. THERE WAS AN EFFORT TO REMOVE THE REMOVAL, THEREBY REINSERTING THE SURVEY. THE EFFORT WAS DENIED. THEREFORE RETAINING THE AMENDMENT AS ORIGINALLY DRAFTED, RESULTING IN THE REMOVAL OF THE SURVEY.
07:22:01.203: >> City Admin. Crawford: THANKS.
07:22:11.113: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE BUDGET AS AMENDED. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
07:22:14.750: >> Councilmember Lumm: I DIDN'T DO THE RAISE THE HAND THING. I WOULD JUST SAY AS WE GO FORWARD, WHAT IS IMPORTANT, IS NOT WHAT'S INCLUDED IN THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL. WE KNOW WE CAN'T AFFORD IT BUT HOW WE IMPLEMENT THE NECESSARY COST SAVINGS WITH THE LOWER REVENUES AND I APPRECIATE THE THOUGHTFUL DISCUSSION WE HAD AROUND THAT. WHETHER WE VOTE YES OR NO DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING. IT BECOMES THE STARTING POINT BUDGET THAT WE WILL HAVE TO BE BEGIN THE RECOVERY AND PLAN, AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS. BECAUSE, FRANKLY, WE PROVIDED THE GUIDANCE FOR DC-8, HAD WE NOT DONE, THAT I WOULD NOT BE SUPPORTING THAT. THANK YOU ALL FOR THE VERY THOUGHTFUL AND COLLEGIAL CONCENSUS BUILDING DISCUSSION AROUND THAT. THAT WAS IMPORTANT. THANK YOU.
07:23:33.496: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
07:23:34.497: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I HAVE A QUESTION FOR MR. CRAWFORD AROUND THE RESOLVE CLAUSES THAT SPEAK TO THE FULL-TIME EQUIVALENT EMPLOYEE POSITIONS. SO IT'S BEEN MY UNDERSTANDING THAT WE HAD SET A CAP ON THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES AND THIS NUMBER 771 IS IN EXCESS OF THAT CAP. THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE ASKING FOR HERE IS THAT WE ALLOW US TO EXCEED -- WELL, THAT THE 772 WAS ACTUALLY -- I LOST MY NUMBER ON THE PAGE HERE THAT THAT'S NINE MORE THAN WE HAVE IN OUR SUPPOSED LIMIT AND THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY ASKING FOR TEN TEMPORARY FTOsEs, WHICH IS EXCESS OF NINE OF THE STANDARD CAP. I'M SORRY I'M NOT EXPLAINING MYSELF PROPERLY.
07:24:36.692: >> City Admin. Crawford: I WONDER IF BY CAP. WE DON'T REALLY HAVE A CAP IT'S WHATEVER YOU AUTHORIZE. BUT THE EXTRA TEN ARE ONLY USED IF WE HAVE A SUCCESSION PLANNING ISSUE. THE REALITY IS WE MOVE FORWARD -- AND THIS IS WHAT MAKES A HIRING FREEZE SOMEWHAT OF AN ART RATHER THAN A SCIENCE. THERE ARE POSITIONS THAT WE WILL NEED TO HIRE FOR AND IN SOME CASES WHEN WE NEED TO OVERHIRE AND HAVE AN OVERLAP, AND THE FUNDING WAS REDUCED TO $80,000 FROM 160, BUT THE FTEs, WE JUST HAVEN'T CHANGED. THAT'S A ROTATING THING. THEY WOULD COME ON FOR A PERIOD OF TIME AND THEN LEAVE. YOU SEE A LOT OF THAT HAPPENING TO SUPPORT THE POLICE DEPARTMENT WHEN WE BROUGHT PEOPLE ON, THE ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. I WOULD NOT ENVISION IT BEING USED NEAR AS MUCH AS WE HAVE IN THE PAST, GIVEN OUR SITUATION THAT WE ARE IN. GONS SO>> Councilmember Hayner: SORRY, SO THE FTEs, WE HAD 772 -- IT WAS AMENDED TO 762 IN 2020, AND NOW WE'RE ASKING IT TO BE 771 IN FISCAL YEAR '21. SO THAT'S NINE -- WE ARE ASKING FOR NINE MORE? PLUS THE POTENTIAL FOR TEN TEMPORARIES IF NECESSARY FOR THIS SUCCESSION PLANNING. BY ADOPTING THIS BUDGET AS IT STANDS WE ARE ALL SAYING WE AGREE TO ADD NINE PEOPLE TO STAFF, DESPITE WE HAVE A HIRING FREEZE. IS THAT WHAT I'M READING HERE?
07:26:25.234: >> City Admin. Crawford: THAT IS CORRECT. THE DESCRIPTION OF THE FTEs AND HOW THEY GOT ADDED, HOW THEY GOT ADDED AND WHAT FUNDS THEY GO FOR IS IN THE BUDGET. THERE'S SOME Q&As THAT WERE ON THE BUDGET AND SOME OF THE OTHER MATERIAL. YES, THE DIFFERENT FUNDS HAVE DIFFERENT REASONS FOR THE DIFFERENT POSITIONS.
07:26:45.721: >> Councilmember Hayner: SURE. OKAY. WELL -- YEAH, I -- I SUSPECT THAT THIS WILL PASS WITHOUT MY VOTE BECAUSE I DON'T SUPPORT ADDING NINE STAFF POSITIONS. I JUST DON'T.
07:27:03.439: >> City Admin. Crawford: LET ME COMMENT ON THIS. THIS IS A BIT OF AN ART SO THERE ARE TIMES WHEN THERE ARE SKILL SETS THAT WE NEED THAT WE DON'T HAVE, IN WHICH CASE THIS AUTHORIZATION WOULD ALLOW ME TO GET THOSE SKILLS. THERE ARE OTHER TIMES WHEN THEY ARE REDUCTIONS THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE THAT WE GO DOWN. SO THIS DOES NOT IN ANY WAY CHANGE THE I WOULD SAY THE OVERALL RESTRICTION THAT I WOULD SEE THE ORGANIZATION WORKING UNDER A PRACTICAL STANDPOINT. BUT I UNDERSTAND YOUR POINT. HA>> Councilmember Hayner: OBVIOUSLY THE LARGEST ASK IS THREE FTEs FOR THE SUSTAINABILITY OFFICE, FOR 2021. AND THAT'S IN THERE.
07:27:56.792: >> City Admin. Crawford: YES. PGH >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER WE
07:27:58.027: >> Councilmember Hayner:  WEAREE THREE PEOPLE.
07:28:02.998: >> City Admin. Crawford: YOU ARE AUTHORIZING THAT THAT COULD HAPPEN AND WHETHER I HAVE A HIRES FREEZE AND DON'T HIRE THEM FOR A PERIOD OF TIME AND SEE WHERE THINGS SHAKE OUT BUT IT WOULD ALLOW ME THE FLEXIBILITY TO HIRE THEM.
07:28:17.246: >> Councilmember Hayner:  OKAY THANK YOU.
07:28:20.349: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
07:28:21.784: >> Councilmember Lumm: OKAY. I WOULD FOLLOW ON THERE WERE BUDGET AMENDMENTS AND STAFFING -- SOME OF THESE STAFFING IS ISSUES. MR. CRAWFORD INDICATED THAT THE FINANCIAL RECOVERY PLAN APPLIES ACROSS ALL PLANS. I WOULD SAY THAT NONE OF US, COUNCIL OR STAFF ARE HAPPY WITH THETHE PREDICAMENT THAT WE ARE D TO VOTE ON AN UNBALANCED BUDGET AND WE ARE ARE WHERE WE ARE, WHICH AGAIN IS WHY WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT HOW WE IMPLEMENT THE COST SAVINGS THAT WE WILL HAVE TO IMPLEMENT AND WE HAVE BEEN PROVIDED AIRFRAME WORK FOR THE FINANCIAL RECOVERY PLAN. THAT IS THE KEY DOCUMENT I WILL SAY.
07:29:30.352: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE BUDGET AS AMENDED? I WOULD LIKE TO CHAT A LITTLE BIT. AS HAS BEEN STATED HERE OPEN A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS AND NUMEROUS TIMES BEFOREHAND AND PROBABLY BE STATED AFTERWARDS THIS IS A PRECOVID ENDEAVOR. IT TAKES MANY MONTHS TO PUT TOGETHER A BUDGET OF $468 MILLION BUDGET, $114 MILLION GENERAL FUND BUDGET. AND AS A CONSEQUENCE, YOU KNOW, THE BUDGET THAT WE PASSED TODAY IN LARGE PART REFLECTS A -- A DIFFERENT REALITY THAN WE FACE TOMORROW. AS A CONSEQUENCE, YOU KNOW, I'M INCREDIBLY CONFIDENT THAT STAFF IS GOING TO COME TOGETHER AND PROVIDE COUNCIL WITH THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS AS TO HOW WE CAN CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THE BASIC SERVICES THAT RESIDENTS DEMAND, THAT RESIDENTS DESERVE, THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS DESERVE. WHILE -- IN A MANNER THAT IS -- A MANNER THAT IS FISCALLY PRUDENT AND MEETS OUR ASPIRATIONS OR QUALITY OF LIFE ASPIRATIONS. STAFF HAS PROVEN TIME AND TIME THEIR ABILITY TO DO THAT AND THIS IS A CAN DAUNTING CHALLENG, BUT I HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THEM. I WOULD LIKE TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE BUDGET AS A WHOLE. WE ARE LOOKING AT A $10 MILLION SHORTFALL IN THE GENERAL FUND IF THE PESSIMISTIC CASE HOLDS. $10 MILLION IS ALSO THE AMOUNT OF MONEY IN THE GENERAL FUND TODAY THAT WE HAVE AS A RESULT OF NEW CONSTRUCTION OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS. YOU KNOW, ALTHOUGH I KNOW THAT GROWTH HAS CONTESTED GROUNDS MANY RESPECTS AND IT HAS PLUSES AND MINUSES FROM PEOPLE'S EXPERIENCE WITHIN THE COMMUNITY. IT IS UNDENIABLY THE BEDROCK OF OUR ABILITY TO DO -- TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES WE PROVIDE EVERY DAY IN A MANNER THAT IS FISCALLY SUSTAINABILITY. $50 MILLION OF OUR GENERAL FUND IS THE RESULT OF CONSTRUCTION OVER. PAST TEN YEARS. THAT'S A SOBERITION FACT AND ONE THAT WE SHOULD CONSIDER, CONSIDERING HOW VITAL THAT $10 MILLION IS TO OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES THAT THE COMMUNITY DEMANDS AND DESERVES TODAY. THE BUDGET, I THINK REFLECTS OUR PRIORITIES. IT FUNDAMENTALLY DOES THE BASICS. WE'RE FIXING, YOU KNOW, MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF ROADS. WE ARE MAKING INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS IN OUR WASTEWATER AND OUR DRINKING WATER, OUR FORM WATER. WE ARE PROVIDING OUTSTANDING POLICE SERVICES AND FIRE SERVICES UP AND DOWN THE LINE. WE'RE GOING TO BE INVESTING IN A MRPH, WE ARE MAKING SURE THATR,S RIGHT RECYCLING AND COMPOSTING, IT'S ALL IN A WAY THAT IS FISCALLY SUSTAINABLE AND MAKES ANN ARBOR PROUD. WE ALSO, OF COURSE, HAVE A BUDGET THAT REFLECTS OUR ASPIRATIONS, AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND CARBON NEUTRALITY AND WE ARE LIGHTING SIDEWALKS AND CROSSWALKS. WE ARE DOING THE THINGS THAT OUR RESIDENTS DEMAND OF US, OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS DEMAND OF US, AND I THINK IT'S A BUDGET THAT WILL NEED TO BE CHANGED BUT IT'S STILL A BUDGET ABOUT -- WITH RESPECT TO WHICH I THINK WE CAN BE VERY PROUD. I WOULD LIKE TO EXTEND MY THANKS AND I DON'T FEEL PARTICULARLY LIKE I'M GOING OUT ON A LIMB HERE WHEN I SAY THAT I THINK IT'S -- THANKS ON BEHALF OF US ALL, TO STAFF, UP AND DOWN THE LINE. MR. CRAWFORD, TO YESTERDAY'S HIRE, FOR THE WORK THAT IS REFLECTED IN THIS BUDGET. WE -- UNDER THE BEST OF TIMES, A BUDGET IS A HERCULEAN EFFORT AND THE BEST TIMES ARE A DISTANT MEMORY TO US. THE PAST COUPLE OF MONTHS HAS BEEN AN INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE SEEING DEDICATED, ENTHUSIASTIC, YOU KNOW, HIGHLY QUALIFIED EXPERTS COME TOGETHER TO FIND A NEW WAY OF DOING BUSINESS WHILE AT THE SAME TIME PROVIDING THE SERVICES AND DOING THE THINGS THAT THE COMMUNITY DEMANDS AND THAT WE AS A COUNCIL REQUIRE AND SO I GUESS I WANT TO, YOU KNOW, EXTEND THE GROUPS, IF I MAY, THANKS TO STAFF FOR THE WORK THAT THIS BUDGET REFLECTS AND THANKS TO AND IN ANTICIPATION FOR THE WORK THAT YOU ALL WILL CONTINUE TO DO, YOU KNOW, GOING FOR, BECAUSE WE RELY UPON IT AND WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR IT. SO THANK YOU. FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE BUDGET AS AMENDED? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] YOU KNOW, I'M SORRY I REALIZED THAT THERE WAS A NEGATIVE VOTE IN THERE. LET'S HAVE A ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
07:34:50.605: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES.

07:35:13.795: >> Councilmember Nelson:  YES.
07:35:18.233: >> Councilmember Smith: YES.
07:35:18.834: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION CARRIES.
07:35:24.106: >> City Admin. Crawford: MAYOR, JUST A COMMENT THAT YOUR AMENDMENTS IN TOTAL RESULTED IN AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE BUDGET'S POSITION BY $1.2 MILLION.
07:35:34.716: >> Councilmember Nelson: THAT'S A ABOUT FACT.
07:35:37.819: >> Mayor Taylor: DO WE HAVE COMMUNICATIONS TODAY FROM OUR CITY ATTORNEY? MR. EATON? COUNCILMEMBER EATON?
07:35:46.194: >> Councilmember Eaton: WE LAID D-3 ON THE TABLE OR DID WE POSTPONE IT TO THE NEXT MEETING?
07:35:51.233: >> Mayor Taylor: POSTPONED IT TO THE NEXT MEETING.
07:35:55.937: >> Councilmember Lumm: WE CAN TAKE A BREAK AND COME BACK HALF AN HOUR OR SO?
07:36:01.543: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. POSTEMA, DO YOU HAVE COMMUNICATIONS TODAY?
07:36:04.279: >> City Atty. Postema: GOOD MORNING. NO.
07:36:07.082: >> Mayor Taylor: WE HAVE BEFORE US THE CLERK'S REPORT OF COMMUNICATION, PETITIONS AND REFERRALS. MAY I HAVE A MOTION. MOVED BY ACKERMAN AND SECONDED BY GRAND. DISCUSSION OF THE CLERK'S REPORT. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? WE NOW COME TO PUBLIC COMMENT GENERAL TIME. PUBLIC COMMENT GENERAL TIME IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO SPEAK TO COUNCIL AND THE COMMUNITY ABOUT MALTERSS OF MUNICIPAL INTEREST. TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT, DIAL THE NUMBER ON YOUR SCREEN, 877-853-5247 AND ENTER MEETING ID991-6815-00141. SPEAKERS HAVE THREE MINUTES IN WHICH TO SPEAK.

CALLERS WILL BE CALLED UP ONE BY ONE OF THE CITY CLERK USING THE LAST THREE DIGITS OF YOUR PHONE NUMBER. WHILE YOU ARE SPEAKING, PLEASE MOVE TO A QUIET AREA AND MUTE ANY TELEVISION OR BACKGROUND SOUNDS SO WE CAN HEAR YOU CLEARLY. IS THIS ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT?
07:37:30.565: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER 931.
07:37:32.567: >> GOOD MORNING. THIS IS ERICA BRIGGS. I WANTED TO GENERALLY THANK ALL OF YOU FOR YOUR HARD WORK ON BEHALF OF THE COMMUNITY THIS EVENING. BUT I FELT COMPELLED TO VOICE MY CONCERNS ON A FEW ITEMS. FIRST, I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT THE CLIMATE NEUTRALITY PLAN WAS NOT ADOPTED TONIGHT. WE CAN'T AFFORD TO KEEP KICKING THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD. I'M ALSO FRUSTRATED TO SEE ADDITIONAL FUNDING STRIPPED FROM PEDESTRIAN SAFETY. WE SAW SOME PRIORITIZATION RANKING PROVIDED BY DR. STULTS THAT THE OPERATING THE NON-MOTORIZED PLAN IN ACHIEVING OUR CLIMATE ACTION GOALS. NON-MOTORIZED FUNDING HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED IN THE PROPOSED RECOVERY PLAN, FURTHER CUTTING THESE FUNDS HAS REAL IMPLICATIONS FOR THE COMMUNITY'S FUTURE. AND ROAD FATALITIES ARE INCREASING DESPITE TRAFFIC VOLUMES BEING DOWN. AND FINELY, ON A SEPARATE NOTE, I AM ALARMED BY THE DISCUSSION WE SAW AT THE BEGINNING OF THE MEETING TONIGHT. MANY MEMBERS OF THIS COUNCIL THOUGHT TO PUNISH MS. CARLISLE FOR EXPRESS VIEWS COUNTER TO THEIR OWN. MS. CARLISLE'S WILLINGNESS TO SERVE AS AS VOLUNTEER SHOULD NOT BE -- IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE ADVOCACY EMAIL WAS EFFECTIVE BECAUSE YOU FELT COMPELLED TO AMEND THE RESOLUTION TO PROTECT AFFORDABLE HOUSING. PERHAPS THE NON-MOTORIZED COMMUNITY SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE VOCAL AS WELL. THANK YOU AND HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.
07:38:58.286: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT?
07:39:08.296: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER 597.
07:39:08.930: >> YES, HELLO. CAN YOU HEAR ME?
07:39:12.334: >> Mayor Taylor: YOU BET? OKAY. THIS IS ZACHARY STORY. I THANK YOU ALL FOR PUTTING IN ALL THIS HARD WORK AND BEFORE I GET INTO IT, I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ALL LAST MEETING APPROVING THE FUNDS FOR THE HOMELESS AND VULNERABLE IN THE COMMUNICATE. BUT WHAT I WANT TO TALK -- IN THE COMMUNITY. BUT WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS THE COMMENTS. I WON'T REPEAT ALL OF THOSE BECAUSE WE HAVE HAD THAT IN THIS MEETING. SO I JUST WANTED TO WALK OUTTHREW YOU MY EXPERIENCE WITH THE WHOLE THING FROM WAKING UP IN THE MORNING TO THIS WHOLE THING GOING ON. I KIND OF JUST -- IT DIDN'T SIT WELL WITH ME AND I PUT DOWN MY PHONE AND DIDN'T LOOK AT IT FOR A WHILE AND CAME BACK AND THIS IS WHAT I WROTE ON TWITTER. I SAID, ANN ARBOR COUNCIL EARLY NOTIFICATION THAT I WILL BE SPEAKING AT NEXT COUNCIL MEETING ON COUNCILMEMBER EATON, NELSON AND GRISWOLD'S ABOUT ANALOGIZING POOR PEOPLE WITH CHICKENS WHEN WE NEED TO BELIEVE YOU MEANT IT IN HUMOR. HOPE YOU REALIZE THE HURT THAT YOU CAUSED PEOPLE LIKE ME. AND THEN THE NEXT DAY I DECIDED I WANTED TO GATHER SOME MORE OPINIONS BEFORE I KIND OF, YOU KNOW, FORMED, YOU KNOW, JUST WENT WITH MY FIRST -- ANY REACTIONS. I WANTED TO GATHER SOME OPINIONS. I POSTED THIS ON MY PERSONAL PAGE. AND I SHARED A SCREEN SHOT AND SAID THIS WAS POSTED ON ANN ARBOR POLITICS PAGE. RESPONSES IS ALL OF THE ANN ARBOR, AND I WOULD APPRECIATE FEEDBACK OF THIS EXCHANGE. I PLAN TO SPEAK ON THIS AT THE NEXT COUNCIL MEETING AND I WOULD LIKE TO TEMPER MY -- THE HOUSING AND INEQUALITY IS SOME OF THE HOTTEST ISSUES IN ANN ARBOR RIGHT NOW AND A FRIEND OF MINE, AN ARTIST AND A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER I MOVE TOED TO CLEVELAND BECAUSE I COULDN'T FIND A SINGLE PLACE TO REPRESENT THAT WAS IN MY PRICE RANGE. A FRIEND OF MINE FROM CONNECTICUT SAID, I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE TO ADDRESS WHETHER THE EGGS ARE WHITE OR BROWN, BUT NOBODY LIKES TO TALK ABOUT THAT. I HAVE A FRIEND WHO IS A TEACHER IN ANN ARBOR, AND SHE SAID, I'M A TEACHER IN ANN ARBOR AND HAVE BEEN PAYING RENT FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS IN WASHTENAW COUNTY AND I'M READY TO OWN A HOUSE BUT EVEN BUYING IN YPSI FEELS OUT OF RANGE FOR ME. OTHER COMMENTS OF PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, JUST REALLY USING RACISM. ANOTHER FRIEND OF MINE FROM BRAZIL, ACCORDING TO HISTORY, A TOWN WAS CALLED PUERTO RICO UNTIL A 1 1850, WHEN PEOPLE TRAD SLAVES TO WORK IN THE PLANTATIONS OF SUGAR CANES.
07:42:16.017: >> Clerk Beaudry: TIME.
07:42:16.551: >> WE WERE TRANSPORTED TOGETHER WITH GUINEA FOWL AND PASSWORDS.
07:42:24.192: >> Clerk Beaudry: TIME.
07:42:24.993: >> AND THE SAME OF THE TOWN WAS CHANGED TO THE PORT OF CHICKENS.
07:42:29.464: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WOULD WOULD LIKE -- WO WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPK AT PUBLIC COMMENT?
07:42:38.740: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER 326.
07:42:39.374: >> THIS IS JAMIE McGARIN. I WANTED TO QUICKLY VOICE MY SUPPORT FOR ALL OF THE HARD WORK OF COUNCILMEMBERS THIS EVENING. IT'S BEEN A LONG NIGHT AND I FOLLOWED IT DILIGENTLY. THERE'S MOMENTS OF SILL I WILL D MOMENTS OF UNCIVILLITY. AND THEN THINGS WERE HAMMERED OUT. THE WORD OR THE PHRASE EMBODY CARBONNISM IS THROWN AROUND A LOT IN COMMUNICATIONS, IN TERMS OF BUILDINGS AND IN TERMS OF DEVELOPMENT IN TOWN AND TREES AND WHATNOT. THERE'S A LOT OF RESOURCES OUT THERE. ON TWITTER, #A2COUNCIL TO PROVIDE ONE OF THEM THAT, CAN HELP YOU UNDERSTAND EMBODIED CARBON AND ACTUALLY, THAT GROUP HAS A TOOL THAT CAN HELP YOU CALCULATE EMBODIED CARBON IN DIFFERENT PROJECTS AND DIFFERENT MATERIALS THAT ARE USED IN PROJECTS. I APPRECIATE THAT COUNCIL IS TALKING ABOUT EMBODIED CARBON AND THE OVERALL IMPACT THAT IT HAS IN DEVELOPMENT. I WOULD ENCOURAGE COUNCIL TO UTILIZE THE TOOLS AND READ ABOUT IT SO THAT IT'S NOT JUST SORT OF THIS GENERALIZED THING THAT WE TALK ABOUT, BUT THAT WE CAN SPECIFICALLY TALK ABOUT NUMBERS AND REALLY WHAT IT MEANS ON A PER PROJECT OR PER MATERIAL BASIS. SO, AGAIN, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALL OF YOUR HARD WORK. AND LOOKING FORWARD TO SEE WHAT COMES OUT IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU.
07:44:13.902: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT?
07:44:28.716: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER 891.
07:44:31.853: >> HI, THIS IS ED VILLA METE. I'M SPEAKING TO YOU IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. ITS BEEN A LONG BUDGET MEETING. I WAS  NOT UP FOR ALL OF IT. WAY NOT AS DILIGENT AS SOME OF THE OTHERS. I WOULD SAY I HAVE BOTH HOPE AND CONCERN FOR THIS COUNCIL. THE HOPE IS THAT YOU ARE ABLE AFTER A LONG NIGHT TO AGREE ON SOMETHING THAT'S A COMPLEX DOCUMENT WITH A LOT OF IMPACT ON THE CITY AND THE YEAR AND THE COMING YEARS. THE CONCERN IS THAT FOR REASONS THAT ARE PROBABLY BIGGER THAN WHAT IS GOING ON IN THIS CITY, IT'S VERY HARD TO HAVE A MEANINGFUL DISCOURSE AMONGST PEOPLE WHEN IT'S -- WHEN IT'S DIFFICULT TO GET TOGETHER IN PERSON. AND I WORRY ABOUT A POLARIZATION OF PUERTO RICO -- A FURTHER POLLERRIZATION, A FURTHER EXTREME POLARIZATION IN ONLINE MEDIA BEING THE PRIMARY SOURCE BY WHICH WE COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER. SO I -- WE ENCOURAGE EVERY MEMBER OF COUNCIL ON EVERY SIDE TO BE MINDFUL THAT WHAT THEY SAY ONLINE CAN BE READ BY OTHERS AND IN WAYS THAT ARE NOT BEING EXPECTED BY THEM, THAT THE PRIVATE SAFE SPACES THAT THEY HAVE SET ASIDE FOR THEMSELVES FOR COMMUNICATIONS MIGHT BE EXCLUSIONARY FOR THE BROADER VIEW OF INTERESTS AND THAT HOPEFULLY THIS TOO WILL PASS. WE CAN SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN AND LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT DAY. AGAIN, THANKS. THIS IS ED VILLAMETTI.
07:46:11.452: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT?
07:46:17.592: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER 340. DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT?
07:46:21.562: >> YES, I DO. LUIS VASQUEZ FROM WARD ONE. I WANTED TO THANK JEANINE LUVERVICH FOR READING INTO THE COUNCIL RECORD THE PUBLIC FACEBOOK POSTINGS OF THE THREE COUNCILMEMBERS WOULD FELT COMPELLED TO ADD TO WHAT AMOUNTED TO AN ILL-ADVISED JOKE ABOUT HOUSING CHICKENS WHILE ALSO AT THE SAME TIME REFERRING JOKINGLY TO DENSITY IN OUR CITY. THOSE PUBLIC COMMENTS THOSE SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES. SO I DON'T NEED TO ADD ANYTHING TO THAT, EXCEPT TO SAY THAT SOME OF THE PUBLIC PERCEPTION OF THOSE PUBLIC FACEBOOK COMMENTS, IS -- IS ONE OF THE SHOCK IN OUR COMMUNITY. I FOUND IN PARTICULAR, ELIZABETH NELSON'S APOLOGY ON ONE OF THE LOCAL FACEBOOK POLITICS PAGES TO BE RATHER FECKLESS, AND I WILL QUOTE HER, I'M VERY SORRY THIS CAME ACROSS SO TERRIBLY. , UNQUOTE. I NOTICE HOW NELSON IS NOT APOLOGIZING FOR HER WORDS THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED HURTFUL TOWARDS THOSE WITH LESS MEANS, BUT TO ME THIS COMMENT FROM NELSON MAKES IT SEEM LIKE THERE'S MORE CONCERN FOR OPTICS RATHER THAN THE SUBSTANCE OF HOW YOUR POLICIES AFFECT REAL PEOPLE. NOW, COUNCILMEMBER NELSON, YOU HAVE MY CONTACT INFO ALSO. JUST IN CASE YOU WANT TO TALK TO ME ABOUT THE COMPLAINT I FILED WITH THE CITY ATTORNEY. AND IF YOU DON'T WANT PUBLIC INPUT -- THIS GOES FOR ALL OF YOU. YOU MAY DISAGREE -- PUBLIC INPUT THAT YOU DISAGREE WITH, LISTEN, JUST SAY SO, SO THAT WE CAN ELECT PEOPLE WHO WILL LISTEN TO US. THANK YOU.
07:48:32.193: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT?
07:48:38.332: >> Clerk Beaudry: MAYOR, THERE ARE NO MORE COMMENTS.
07:48:41.569: >> Mayor Taylor: SEEING NO ONE, PUBLIC COMMENT IS CLOSED. ARE THIS COMMENTS FROM COUNCIL? SMITH, HAYNER AND RAMLAWI.
07:48:53.714: >> Councilmember Smith: I HAVE A SUGGESTION FOR NEXT YEAR. THIS IS OF THE LAST TIME I WILL GO THROUGH THISSE THIS EXERCISE, PERHAPS THANKFULLY. I WOULD SUGGEST NEXT YEAR AS YOU SET THE CALENDAR FOR COUNCIL, THAT YOU LOOK AT MAKING THE SECOND MONDAY IN MAY A REGULAR MEETING, AND DEDICATE THE THIRD MONDAY IN MAY TO THE BUDGET. AND MAKE IT A DISCUSSION OF NOTHING OTHER THAN THE BUDGET. I THINK IT WAS A GREAT DISSERVICE THAT WE DID TO THE COMMUNITY THAT WE BEGAN THE BUDGET DISCUSSION AT 1:20 A.M. THIS MORNING. I THINK THAT THAT IS NOT CUING TO OUR VALUES OF TRANSPARENCY AND ACCESSIBILITY. I THINK IT'S AMAZING DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROCESS, WHEN IT DOESN'T BEGIN UNTIL LONG AFTER MOST OF OUR COMMUNITY IS IN BED. SO JUST A SUGGESTION FOR. NEXTYEAR. THANK YOU.
07:49:56.077: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
07:49:57.445: >> Councilmember Hayner: COUNCILMEMBER SMITH, I ABSOLUTELY AGREE. MY APOLOGIES FOR HAVING IT WOES BECAUSE I FULLY INTENDED WHEN THE AGENDA BROUGHT FORWARD TO MOVE TO TABLE EVERYTHING BUT THE BUDGET BECAUSE WE KNOW HOW THE BUDGET DISCUSSION IS GOING TO GO. AND I WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH HAPPIER HAD WE DONE THAT AND PUT EVERYTHING OFF UNTIL EITHER THE NEXT MEETING OR THE SUGGESTION THAT MR. SMITH JUST MADE WE RECYCLE THE CALENDAR A LITTLE BIT OR RESHUFFLE THE CALENDAR A LITTLE BIT TO COME UP WITH A BUDGET ONLY MEETING. THE TRUTH IS I WITHHELD RESOLUTIONS THAT I HAD INTENDED TO BRING FORWARD BECAUSE I THOUGHT THE INTENSION WAS TONLET TOONLY TO HAVE BUDGET CONTENT ON IT. I WAS FRANKLY TURNED TO SEE THINGS NOT RELATED TO THE BUDGET ON TONIGHT'S AGENDA. AND SO I -- YOU KNOW, NOT ONLY AM. I DISAPPOINTED THAT MY RESOLUTIONS THAT I HAD ACTUALLY INTENDED TO BRING FORWARD IN A TIMELY MANNER FOR OTHER PROMISES WERE WITHHELD, WHEN THEY COULD HAVE BEEN ON THERE TO CLOUD OUR AGENDA, BUT THAT OTHERS WERE, AND SO I SHARE YOUR DISAPPOINTMENT IN THIS LATE MEETING. IT DOESN'T BOTHER ME, BECAUSE I'M A NIGHT OWL. I HAVE TO GO TO WORK ON AN EMERGENCY BASEMENT LEAK PROJECT RIGHT NOW. I'M HAPPY TO STAY UP UNTIL 5:00. THERE WERE A LOT OF DISAPPOINTMENTS TODAY. AND THIS NOTION THAT I SAW SOME THINGS FLYING AROUND ABOUT THIS NOTION THAT COUNCILWOMAN NELSON IS SOMEHOW VIOLATING CAMPAIGN FINANCE LAW BY TRYING TO INFORM VOTERS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS AT THE CITY AND TALK WITH STAFF AND PROVIDE THIS KIND OF VALUABLE SERVICE WHEN WE'RE ALL STUCK AT HOME IS PREPOSTEROUS WHEN WE ALL EXPERIENCED TODAY, YOU KNOW, HUNDREDS -- DOZENS OR HUNDREDS, I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY OF YOU GOT FROM EMAILS FROM A CLEAR LOBBYING GROUP THAT THE CITY APPEARS -- THAT APPEARS TO BE DOING WITH THE TACIT APPROVAL OF THE OFFICE OF SUSTAINABLE AND A2C.ORG ANYTHING 40 YOU THIS HE VOTE AND IF YOU DON'T VOTE THIS WAY OR THAT WAY AND WE WILL VOTE YOU SO ON THAT. THAT'S A LITTLE LOBBYING ORGANIZATION THAT'S DOING IT WITH THE CITY'S SEAL ON THE GO THE TOM OF THE WEBSITE AND MORE TO THE POINT THE CITY SEAL EXISTS ON THE BOTTOM OF A PAGE THAT IS A FUND-RAISING FORM FOR THE ECOLOGY CENTER. YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT CAMPAIGN FINANCE POTENTIAL VIOLATIONS, TAKE A LOOK AT THE A2 CLIMATE PARTNERSHIP. AND FOR THOSE OF YOU WOULD ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH IT, I ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO IT. NOW PEOPLE ARE WELCOME TO GET TO GO AND JOIN UP AND DO WHATEVER THEY WANT AND PUT THEIR IMPROMPTU ON THINGS BUT I THINK IT'S INAPPROPRIATE THAT THE CITY SEAL IS USED NOT ONLY AS A FUND-RAISING EFFORT FOR THE ECOLOGY CENTER BUT THAT THE STAFF POTENTIALLY HAS WHEREWITHAL TO HAVE THOUSANDS OF VOTERS ENCOURAGE US TO FUND THEIR JOBS. AND THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING THERE WITH A2 CLIMATE PARTNERSHIP. AND I WAS SURPRISED TO SEE IT AND KIND OF NOT SURPRISED TOO, BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THIS STUFF HAS BEEN GOING ON A LONG TIME. AND SO I WANT TO PUT THAT OUT THERE. AND I COULD GO OPEN FOR A WHILE, BUT I GOT TO GET GOING. SO THANK YOU ALL FOR PARTICIPATING. I'M SORRY I DIDN'T JOIN YOU IN YOUR VOTE FOR THE BUDGET, BUT IN GOOD CONSCIENCE, DESPITE MR. CRAWFORD'S ASSURANCES THAT THIS IS HEAVILY MODIFIED IN THE FUTURE, I CAN'T BRING MYSELF TO PUT A NAME THAT SAVED $1.4 MILLION OFF A $10 MILLION NEEDED SAVINGS.
07:53:44.839: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM. I'M SORRY, COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI WAS NEXT IN THE CUE. MY APOLOGIES.
07:53:51.545: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  GO AHEAD, COUNCILMEMBER LUMM. I CAN WAIT.
07:53:56.684: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANKS. I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THE SECOND MEETING IN MAY HAS -- IS FOR DECADES, UPON DECADES ALWAYS BEEN THE MEETING WHEN WE -- IT'S DESIGNATED TO APPROVE THE BUDGET. THE CITY BUDGET. IT'S ALWAYS A -- A TRADITIONAL COUNCIL MEETING AND WHERE WE HAVE THE TRADITIONAL AGENDA FILLED WITH NON-BUDGET ITEMS IN A BUDGET MEETING. THE CHARTER ALLOWS US TO -- I HAVE SERVED ON COUNCILS WHEN WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO CONCLUDE THE MEETING AFTER -- BUDGET MEETINGS ARE VERY LONG. ACTUALLY THIS IS SHORTER THAN MOST I HAVE EXPERIENCED. [ CRACKLING AUDIO ] BUT WE ARE ALLOWED TO BY CHARTER EXTEND THIS BUDGET MEETING TO THE LAST MEETING IN MAY. THAT IS OUR REQUIREMENT AND THE DROP DEAD TIME FOR WHEN WE NEED TO APPROVE THE BUDGET. THAT'S ALWAYS AN OPTION. THEY HAVE ALWAYS APPROVED THE BUDGET. [ CRACKLING AUDIO ] ALWAYS APPROVE THE BUDGET AT THIS SECOND MEETING. IT'S AHE A LONG MEETING. THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY TO ADJOURN AND RECONVENE AND PICK ANOTHER DATE. WE JUST HAVE TO APPROVE THE BUDGET BY MAY 31st, BASICALLY.
07:55:39.353: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
07:55:40.387: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, AND, YEAH. SORRY I HAVEN'T BEEN OUT THERE EITHER. IT'S BEEN OBVIOUSLY A CHARGED, STUFF DAY FOR EVERYBODY. BUT WE FINISHED WHAT WE SET OUT TO DO. I APPRECIATE COUNCILMEMBER SMITH'S SUGGESTION, PERHAPS THE ADMIN COMMITTEE COULD HAVE PLACED THE CLIMATE ACTION ON A DIFFERENT DAY. I JUST THINK WHEN WE HAVE BIG POLICY DECISIONS AND DISCUSSIONS TO HAVE, PERHAPS THOSE ARE NOT BEST DAYS TO PUT ON TOP OF THE BUDGET DISCUSSIONS. YOU KNOW, AND JUST TO CLEAR UP A LITTLE BIT EARLIER BY FRUSTRATIONS AND DISAPPOINTMENT WITH OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS, AND, YOU KNOW, WE'RE GOING TO GET A LOT MORE DONE IN IN COMMUNITY IF WE WORK TOGETHER. AND WE REACH OUT AND WE ACTUALLY WANT TO UNDERSTAND THE ISSUES AND -- AND PROVIDE THE PUBLIC WITH GOOD INFORMATION. IT'S GOING TO MAKE OUR JOBS MUCH MORE CHALLENGING. AND LESS EFFECTIVE IF OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS PUT OUT EMAILS THAT INFLAME AND INCITE THE FEARS THAT MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY HAVE. AND WHEN THEY ARE COMPLETELY UNFOUNDED. THAT IS THE CHALLENGE THAT I HAVE WITH PUTTING PEOPLE ON BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS. YOU KNOW, THEY CAN DISAGREE WITH ME ALL THEY WANT. IT'S NOT -- I'M NOT TRYING TO SHUT DOWN FREE SPEECH. I'M TRYING TO GET POLICIES IMPLEMENTED AND PROBLEMS SOLVED. AND WHEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE ON BOARDS
