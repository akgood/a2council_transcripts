00:00:13.071: >> Vice Chair Mills: WE CALL TO ORDER THE PLANNING COMMISSION MEETING, THE NOVEMB NOVEMBER 7th MEETING. I DID THE CALL TO ORDER AND SO THE ROLL CALL.
00:00:21.180: >> THANK YOU. [ ROLL CALL ] WE HAVE A QUORUM.
00:00:37.997: >> Vice Chair Mills: GREAT. THERE ARE NO INTRODUCTIONS. SO THE MINUTES OF THE PREVIOUS MEETING FROM THE OCTOB OCTOBER 1st PLANNING COMMISSION MEETING, DOES SOMEONE WANT TO MOVE THOSE MINUTES. COMMISSIONER ABRAMS, SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL. ALL IN FAVOR OF APPROVING THE MINUTES, PLEASE SAY AYE. [CHORUS OF AYES] NEXT IS APPROVAL OF THE AGENDA.
00:01:04.290: >> I HAVE A SUGGESTION OR A RECOMMENDATION THAT THE AGENDA BE AMENDED BEFORE IT IS APPROVED. THE ITEM NUMBER 9B, WHICH IS A PREPETITION CONFERENCE FOR A PROPOSED PUD PROJECT AT 2195 EAST ELLSWORTH, THAT THAT BE REMOVED FROM THE REGULAR BUSINESS PORTION, AND THEN MOVED TO AFTER THE ADJOURNMENT AND IT BE DISCUSSED IN A WORKING SESSION.
00:01:35.254: >> Vice Chair Mills: WILL ANYONE MOVE THE AGENDA AS AMENDED?
00:01:45.064: >> SO I MOVE.
00:01:46.132: >> Vice Chair Mills: IT WAS MOVED BY COMMISSIONER BRIGGS. SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER -- SARAH AND -- HAMMERSCHMIDT. YES? I DON'T CHAIR THIS VERY OFTEN, AUDIENCE. SORRY. ALL IN FAVOR OF THE AGENDA AS AMENDED? PLEASE SAY AYE. [CHORUS OF AYES] THAT IS EVERYBODY. NEXT IS ITEM SIX, REPORTS FROM CITY ADMINISTRATION, CITY COUNCIL, PLANNING COMMISSION OFFICERS AND COMMITTEES. FIRST WE START WITH COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN, OUR CITY COUNCIL REPRESENTATIVE.
00:02:23.936: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MADAM CHAIR. JUST A FEW ITEMS OF UPDATE FROM MONDAY NIGHT'S CITY COUNCIL MEETING. FIRST TWO PROPERTIES WERE ACQUIRED BY THE CITY, ONE A GREENBELT PROPERTY OUTSIDE THE CITY LIMITS AND THE SECOND NEW NATURAL AREA PURCHASED AS PARKLAND WITHIN THE CITY LIMITS. THE -- THE DOWNTOWN AFFORDABLE HOUSING PREMIUM ORDINANCE AMENDMENTS PASSED UNANIMOUSLY AT SECOND READING WITHOUT ANY MATERIAL AMENDMENTS. SO CONGRATULATIONS ON A JOB WELL-DONE TO MS. DELEO, THE STAFF MEMBER WHO WORKED ON THAT AND ALL COMMISSION MEMBERS WHO APPARENTLY PERFECTED IT. IT'S TEN YEARS SINCE THE DOWNTOWN PREMIUMS WERE UPDATED IN A MATERIAL FASHION AND I LOOK FORWARD TO MONITORING THE EFFECT THAT THESE UPDATES BRING AND HOPEFULLY BRING MANY MORE UNITS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AS WELL AS FUNDING TO THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUND. AND FINALLY, LAST UPDATE, CITY COUNCIL ALSO PASSED A RESOLUTION CALLING THE CITY TO LEAD THE EFFORTS OF CREATING A CARBON NEUTRAL COMMUNITY BY 2030. THESE HAVE LAND USE OBVIOUSLY PLAYS A HUGE ROLE IN HOW WE EMIT CARBON AS A CITY, AND SO THIS COMMISSION WILL BE PLACED CENTRALLY IN A LOT OF POLICY DECISIONS THAT WILL NEED TO BE MADE. SOME OF THEM VERY DIFFICULT, SOME OF THEM LOW HANGING FRUIT BUT PROBABLY MOST OF THEM VERY DIFFICULT. SO THANK YOU.
00:04:02.401: >> Vice Chair Mills: VERY GOOD. PLANNING MANAGER, MS. DILEO, DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO REPORT?
00:04:07.039: >> I DO NOT HAVE ANYTHING THIS EVENING.
00:04:10.209: >> Vice Chair Mills: ALL RIGHT. THERE ARE ANY PLANNING COMMISSION OFFICERS OR COMMITTEES THAT WANT TO REPORT OUT? SEEING NO ONE.
00:04:18.651: >> HOLD ON.
00:04:19.852: >> Vice Chair Mills: SORRY, I DIDN'T LOOK CLOSE ENOUGH. I APOLOGIZE COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL.
00:04:24.824: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: I WOULD SAY ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION, OBVIOUSLY, THE EMERGENCY CLIMATE ACTION THING CAME THROUGH US FIRST AND I THINK THERE'S GOING TO NEED TO BE SOME -- SOME GOOD WORKING TOGETHER IN TERMS OF SOME OF THE POLICIES AND BUDGETING -- NOT THAT WE MAKE BUDGETING DECISIONS BUT THINKING ABOUT PROJECTS AND ALL OF THOSE KIND OF THINGS THAT WILL BE ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO MOVE TOWARDS THAT GOAL AND ANY KIND OF REALISTIC WAY. SO I WOULD IMAGINE THAT THERE MAY NEED TO BE SOME MORE MESHING IN TERMS OF ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION AND PLANNING COMMISSION AS WE TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO HIT THAT GOAL, BECAUSE THAT'S COMING UP FAST.
00:05:07.299: >> Vice Chair Mills: ALL RIGHT. YES? COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN?
00:05:10.369: >> Councilmember Ackerman: SORRY, I WILL GIVE AN UPDATE FROM THE HOUSING AND HUMAN SERVICES ADVISORY BOARD ALSO RELEVANT TO CITY COUNCIL. THE PLANNING OFFICE AND THE FINANCE OFFICE AT CITY HALL HAVE BEEN WORKING ON A FEASIBILITY STUDY OF MULTIPLE PUBLICLY OWNED PROPERTIES FOR THEIR VIABILITY TO -- FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THAT REPORT IS NOW READY AND WILL BE PRESENTED TO CITY COUNCIL ON NOVEMBER 17th, I BELIEVE, IS THE MONDAY. IT MIGHT BE THE 18th. BUT THE REPORT IS AVAILABLE ON LEGISTAR AS WELL. I ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO GIVE THE READ. IT'S VERY ENCOURAGING. THERE ARE NINE CITY-OWNED PROPERTIES THAT ARE DEVELOPABLE AND STAND A GOOD CHANCE OF GETTING FEDERAL AND STATE FUNDING TO -- TO PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SO REALLY ENCOURAGING. THE REPORT IS VERY DETAILED. AND IT'S THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS A VERY TANGIBLE PLAN TO SEE THAT HAPPEN.
00:06:11.730: >> Vice Chair Mills: VERY GOOD. ALL RIGHT. NOW I WILL SAY THERE ARE NO OTHER COMMITTEE REPORTS. 6D IS WRITTEN COMMUNICATION AND PETITIONS AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS IN OUR PACKET AND I THINK PRINTED OFF BEFORE YOU, PERHAPS. AND THE NEXT ITEM ON OUR AGENDA IS AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION. AUDIENCE MEMBERS MAY SPEAK FOR THREE MINUTES ABOUT AN ITEM THAT IS NOT LISTED ON THE PUBLIC HEARING ON THIS AGENDA. SO IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A PUBLIC COMMENT, YOU CAN PLEASE APPROACH THE PODIUM AND STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS FOR THE RECORD. ALL RIGHT. I DON'T SEE ANYONE. SO I WILL CLOSE THE AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION AND MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER 8, WHICH IS THE PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULED FOR THE NEXT BUSINESS MEETING. MS. DILEO, DO YOU WANT ME TO RAZE THESE?
00:07:15.761: >> I THINK YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO.
00:07:17.563: >> Vice Chair Mills: GREAT THERE. WILL BE A PUBLIC HEARING -- IS THIS FOR THE NEXT ONE?
00:07:26.105: >> I CAN EXPLAIN THAT WE HAD -- WE HAD A TECHNICAL ERROR IN THE PUBLIC HEARING NOTICE FOR THESE FOUR PARK REZONINGS SO WE WILL BE HOLDING ANOTHER PUBLIC HEARING AT THE NEXT MEETING. SO THIS IS ACCURATE, AND FEELS LIKE DEJA VU.
00:07:46.992: >> Vice Chair Mills: GOT IT! GREAT. SO FOR THE NEXT MEETING, WHICH WE'LL BE BACK TO OUR REGULARLY SCHEDULED TUESDAY, IT'S THE THIRD TUESDAY OF THE MONTH. SO TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 19th, AT 7 P.M., WE WILL HAVE REZONING OF THREE CITY PARKS AND ONE ADDITION TO HANSEN PARK FROM THE CURRENT ZONING, THE DESIGNATIONS TO PUBLIC HAND, DISTRICT FOUR CITY COUNCIL, THOSE ARE BUTTON PUSH NATURE AREA, HICKORY NATURE AREA AND UNNAMED 1.3-ACRE PARK ON EAST EISENHOWER AND 1.5-ACRE ADDITION TO HANSEN PARK. THERE'S ALSO 36 -- 3611 TO 3621 PLYMOUTH ROAD REZONING, SITE PLAN WITH PLANNED PROJECT MODIFICATIONS AND SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE FOR DRIVE THRU FACILITY. AND 2385 EAST ELLSWORTH SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE FOR A MEDICAL MARIJUANA PROVISIONING CENTER AND MARIJUANA RETAILER. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THESE, YOU CAN -- LET'S SEE, IT SAYS YOU CAN CONTACT PLANNING SERVICES UNIT. OKAY. NOW, REGULAR BUSINESS. SO WE HAVE ONE ITEM OF REGULAR BUSINESS, WHICH IS -- THIS IS WHERE THE DEJA VU COMES IN, THE REZONING OF THREE CITY PARKS AND ADDITION OF HANSEN PARK. WE WILL HAVE THE PUBLIC HEARING AND THEN DISCUSSION THE MOTION.
00:09:18.183: >> THANK YOU. THIS IS A REZONING OF FOUR PARK PROPERTIES THAT WERE RECENTLY ACQUIRED. I WILL -- WE HAVE WRITTEN A SINGLE STAFF REPORT AND WE ARE HOLDING ONE SINGLE PUBLIC HEARING TONIGHT AS WELL AS ANOTHER AT THE NEXT MEETING. BUT -- CITY COUNCIL WILL BE TAKING THESE SEPARATELY WHEN IT GETS TO THEM. THE FIRST REZONING AND ALSO LET ME SAY THAT PURCHASING OR ACCEPTING LAND DONATIONS DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY CHANGE A ZONING DESIGNATION. ZONING MAP IS PART OF THE CHAPTER 55, THE UDC AND ONLY AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND THE UDC AND THE ZONING MAP CAN CHANGE THE ZONING DESIGNATION OF ANY LAND. SO EVEN THOUGH THESE ARE NOW UNDER THE CITY OWNERSHIP, A P.L., PUBLIC LAND ZONING DESIGNATION DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY MOVE FORWARD. WE NEED TO GO THROUGH THIS REZONING PROCESS. THE BUTTONBUSH NATURE AREA IS ON DHU VARREN, AND A TOTAL OF 16 ACRES, ABOUT, 6 ACRES WAS DONATED BY THE TOLL BROTHERS, AND ANOTHER 10 ACRES WAS PURCHASED BY THE CITY. THIS CAME WITH THE NORTH OAKS PROJECT, THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE NIXON FARM INTO THE NORTH OAKS NEIGHBORHOOD. IT IS CURRENTLY ZONED R4A WITH CONDITIONS, AS IS THE ADJACENT NORTH OAKS AND WE ARE PROPOSING TO REZONE IT TO P.L. THE SECOND AREA IS THE HICKORY NATURE AREA, LOCATED AT 2817 DILLON DRIVE. IT'S ABOUT 2 ACRES OF NATURAL AREA, DONATED BY PULTE HOMES. PART OF THEIR NORTH SKY DEVELOPMENT. IT IS CURRENTLY ZONED R1D, AS IS THE ADJACENT NORTH SKY SITE AND WE ARE PROPOSING TO REZONE IT TO P.L. THIRD PIECE OF PROPERTY IS 385 EAST EISENHOWER PARKWAY. THIS IS -- I'M SORRY. I FEEL LIKE IT'S -- THIS IS JUST MORE THAN ONE ACRE DONATED AS PART OF THE MALLETS VIEW OFFICE CENTER DEVELOPMENT AND PUD. IT WAS DONATED IN 2007. AND IT IS CURRENTLY ZONED PUD. WE ARE PROPOSING TO REZONING IT TO P.L. AND FINALLY, THERE HAS BEEN AN ADDITION TO THE HANSEN NATURE AREA AT 1200 SOUTH MAPLE ROAD THIS 1.5-ACRE PIECE THAT I HAVE CIRCLED IN RED CAME FROM AVALON NONPROFIT HOUSING CORPORATION AS PART OF THEIR HICKORY WAY SITE PLAN. SO WITH THIS ADDITION, HANSEN NATURE AREA IS NOW 9 ACRES. THE PIECE IS CURRENTLY ZONED R4B AS IS THE ADJACENT HICKORY WAY SITE AND WE ARE PROPOSING TO REZONE IT TO P.L. I WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AND, AGAIN THIS WOULD COME BEFORE YOU AGAIN NEXT WEEK. I'M SORRY, NEXT MEETING. WE WILL BE RECOMMENDING APPROVAL BUT TONIGHT WE ARE RECOMMENDING THAT IT BE POSTPONED SO THAT A PROPER PUBLIC HEARING CAN BE ADVERTISED AND HELD.
00:12:42.754: >> Vice Chair Mills: VERY GOOD. NOW WE WILL OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING. IF ANYONE WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION ON THIS ITEM OF BUSINESS, PLEASE STEP FORWARD AND, AGAIN, STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS FOR THE RECORD. SEEING NO TAKERS, I WILL CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING, BUT, AGAIN, REMIND PEOPLE THAT THERE WILL BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK AT THE NEXT MEETING. ALL RIGHT. I WILL READ THE MOTION. THE MOTION READS THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION HEREBY RECOMMENDS THAT THE MAYOR AND THE CITY COUNCIL APPROVE THE BUT TOP BUSH FROM R4A WITH CONDITIONS TO P.L. PUBLIC LAND, THE HICKORY NATURE AREA REZONING FROM R1D SINGLE FAMILY DWELLING TO P.L., THE 385 EAST EISENHOWER PARKWAY PARK REZONING FROM PUD PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT TO P.L., AND THE HANSEN NATURE AREA ADDITION REZONING FROM R4B MULTIPLE FAMILY DWELLING TO P.L. DO I HAVE A COMMISSIONER WHO WILL MOVE THIS? MOVED BY COMMISSIONER BRIGGS AND SECONDED BY GIBB-RANDALL. ANY DISCUSSION? COMMISSIONER BRIGGS?
00:13:57.295: >> Commissioner Briggs: I JUST HAD A FEW QUESTIONS ABOUT THESE PARCELS. I THINK WITH THE -- IF I UNDERSTAND THE BUTTON BUSH ONE, THAT'S KIND OF A MORE SENSITIVE NATURAL AREA. AM I CORRECT ON THAT?
00:14:10.075: >> I CAN FOLLOW UP WITH THE PARKS AND MAP. I DO BELIEVE IT HAS SOME -- AT LEAST PROCEEDIUM, PERHAPS HIGH QUALITY NATURAL AREAS ON IT.
00:14:22.587: >> Commissioner Briggs: SO I WAS WONDER JUST ABOUT -- A LITTLE BIT OF THE -- THE PROCESS FOR ACCEPTING THIS OBVIOUSLY, JUST HELPING US UNDERSTAND MAYBE EVEN FOR THE NEXT PUBLIC HEARING IN TERMS OF AS WHEN A WHEN WE -- WHEN LAND IS OFFERED, SORT OF HOW THAT IS ASSESSED. I HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT HOW MUCH OF OUR PARKLAND IS ADJACENT TO HIGHWAYS, WHICH NOT -- YOU KNOW, IN TERMS OF -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT PERCENTAGE THAT WOULD BE, BUT IN THIS, IT'S EVIDENT THAT IT'S NEXT TO HIGHWAYS AND IT OBVIOUSLY PROVIDES A NICE BUFFER FOR THE FOLKS LIVING IN THOSE COMMUNITIES, BUT I'M JUST CURIOUS HOW PARKS THINKS ABOUT THAT LAND IN TERMS OF PARK SPACE AS WELL. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW ANY SPECIFICS ON THESE PROPERTIES.
00:15:11.937: >> I WILL HAVE A FOLLOW-UP. I DO RECALL DURING THE SITE PLAN PROCESS FOR THE NORTH OAKS PROJECTS, THAT NAP, THE NATURAL PRESERVATION AREA, ADVOCATES AND EXPRESSED INTEREST IN THAT PARTICULAR PIECE. THAT'S WHY I HAD MENTIONED THAT IT HAS AT LEAST PREMIUM OR HIGH QUALITY WOODLANDS. THEY $SOME OPEN AREAS ON THE NORTH OAKS SOUTH PIECE THAT THEY ACTUALLY SAID THAT WAS -- THAT THEY DID NOT WANT TO TAKE ON AND THEY WOULD NOT ACCEPT A DONATION. SO SPECIFIC TO THIS ONE, I WILL ASK ABOUT --
00:15:49.241: >> Commissioner Briggs: YEAH.
00:15:49.975: >> WHAT QUALITIES MAKE IT --
00:15:54.646: >> Commissioner Briggs: I WAS WONDERING ABOUT THE HICKORY NATURE AREA, BUT OUT OF CURIOSITY.
00:15:59.518: >> SURE.
00:16:05.390: >> Vice Chair Mills: COMM ISSIONE R GIBB-RANDALL.
00:16:06.892: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: I WOULD BE CURSE CURIOUS WITH TE HICKORY NATURE AREA, THERE WOULD BE SOME WAYS TO MOVE NORTH SUD AND MOVE IT NEAR THE RIVER AND I WOULD BE CURIOUS TO SEE HOW THAT WOULD FIT INTO A LARGER PICTURE OF CONNECTIVITY BOTH FOR HAS BEEN TASS AND PEOPLE MOVING THROUGH THAT AREA. IS THAT SOMETHING THAT THE CITY IS STILL ACTIVELY TRYING TO STRATEGICALLY MAKE HAPPEN OR I KNOW IT WAS A WHILE AGO THAT I HEARD ABOUT THAT AS AN EFFORT AND I'M CURIOUS TO SEE, FRANKLY, IF ANY OF THESE PROJECTS FIT INTO ANY KIND OF LARGER SCHEMA OF HOW PARKS ARE CONNECTED BOTH FOR HUMAN USE AND HABITAT.
00:16:56.308: >> YES, I WILL HAVE FOLLOW-UP
00:16:57.142: >> Vice Chair Mills: COMMISSIONE R WOODS?
00:17:00.879: >> Commissioner Woods: AND THEN I WOULD ALSO HAVE A QUESTION AS TO THOSE WHO ARE MAKING THESE DONATIONS, WHICH APPEARS TO BE GENEROSITY ON THEIR PART, IS THERE ANY SORT OF FINANCIAL BENEFIT WHICH COMES TO THE PERSON WHO IS MAKING THE DONATION? AND IN PARTICULAR, I'M JUST CURIOUS ABOUT AVALON BEING A NONPROFIT HOUSING CORPORATION, IT ALMOST SEEMS LIKE WHY WOULD THEY GIVE UP A RESOURCE, WHICH COULD BE VERY IMPORTANT TO THEM AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE. AND TURN IT OVER TO THE CITY? SO JUST THINGS I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW.
00:17:40.885: >> I CAN ADDRESS THE PIECE FROM THE HANSEN NATURE AREA AND AVALON. THE PIECE THAT THEY DONATED IS COVERED IN WETLAND AREA. SO IT IS UNBUILDABLE FOR THEM. SO THIS -- THIS MOVES IT OFF OF THEIR RESPONSIBILITY INTO THE CITY'S RESPONSIBILITY IS ON BUILDABLE LAND. THEY GET CREDIT FOR THE AREA, FOR FLOOR AREA AND DENSITY PURPOSES. SO THEY ARE NOT PENALIZED BY DONATING THE LAND, BUT IT IS UNBUILDABLE AND SO IT MAKES ITS OWNERSHIP PIECE SMALLER FOR MANAGEABILITY AND THEY MIGHT HAVE LESS TAX BURDEN BECAUSE OF IT -- THEIR SMALLER LAND SIZE. THAT I'M NOT CERTAIN GIVEN THEIR NONPROFIT STATUS, BUT THEY DID NOT DONATE BUILDABLE LAND.
00:18:39.778: >> Vice Chair Mills: ANYTHING ELSE? SOMEONE MOVE A POSTPONEMENT? COMMISSIONER -- POSTPONEMENT WAS MOVED GAY COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL AND SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER BRIGGS. ANY DISCUSSION ON THE MOTION TO POSTPONE? ALL IN NAVOR OF BOTH PONEMENT, PLEASE SAY -- ALL IN FAVOR IN POSTPONEMENT, PLEASE SAY AYE. [CHORUS OF AYES] THAT IS EVERYONE. SO WE WILL SEE THIS NEXT TIME. WE HAVE MOVED ITEM 9B. SO NOW WE ARE ON TO ITEM 10, WHICH IS AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION. AGAIN, LOTS OF OPPORTUNITIES TO PARTICIPATE, FOLKS! ANYBODY WHO IS INTERESTED TO TALK ABOUT ANY ISSUE THAT THEY WANT CAN COME FORWARD. YOU HAVE THE PODIUM FOR THREE MINUTES, JUST PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS. ALL RIGHT. WE'LL CLOSE ITEM 10. THERE IS -- NOW WE'RE ON 11, COMMISSION PROPOSED BUSINESS, AND THERE'S SOMETHING ALREADY IN OUR PACKETS THAT HAS BEEN PROPOSED FOR US.
00:19:41.206: >> THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. IN YOUR PACKETS, YOU HAVE A MEMO FROM PLANNING MANAGER BRETT LENART ABOUT THE CITY COUNCIL'S LEGISLATIVE POLICY AGENDA AND THE PLANNING COMMISSION'S RECOMMENDATION TO IT. THE CITY COUNCIL HAS A COMMITTEE THAT DRAFTS A POLICY AGENDA. IT'S PROVIDED -- THE COMMITTEE PROVIDES IT TO COUNCIL FOR ADOPTION. PRIOR TO FINALIZING THAT, THE CITY COUNCIL SEEKS ADVICE AND RECOMMENDATIONS FROM ITS ADVISORY BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS, AND THE PLANNING COMMISSION IS ONE OF THEM. WE HAVE ATTACHED THE LAST TWO POLICY AGENDAS THAT HAVE BEEN ADOPTED. IF THE PLANNING COMMISSION HAS ANY POLICY FEEDBACK, THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO FORWARD TO THE CITY COUNCIL, I CAN PROVIDE A TEMPLATE FOR MOVING AND SUGGESTING SOMETHING TO BE INCLUDED. I WILL JUST HIT THE HIGHLIGHTS -- OR THE TOPICS THAT HAVE BEEN COVERED IN THE PAST TWO YEARS. THE POLICY AGENDA INCLUDED RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE INTEREST OF CREATING AND SUSTAINING AN AFFORDABLE AND WELCOMING COMMUNITY. POLICIES IN THE INTEREST OF CREATING AND SUSTAINING LOCAL AND REGIONAL MOBILITY AND TRANSPORTATION SAFETY, POLICIES IN THE INTEREST OF PROMOTING A SUSTAINABLE AND HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT, POLICIES IN THE INTEREST OF PROVIDING OPEN TRANSPARENT EFFECTIVE AND FINANCIALLY SOUND LOCAL GOVERNMENT, POLICIES IN THE INTEREST OF PRESERVING THE RIGHT OF SELF-DETERMINATION IN OUR COMMUNITY IN THE INTEREST OF SAFE AND WELCOMING AND INCLUSIVE COMMUNITY IN THE INTEREST OF PROVIDING A FINANCIALLY STABLE LOCAL GOVERNMENT, PROMOTING RESPONSIBLE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN THE INTEREST OF PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT AS RESPONSIBLE STEWARDS OF A NATURAL RESOURCE. AND IN THE INTEREST OF BUILDING AND MAINTAINING A SUSTAINABLE INFRASTRUCTURE. OH, ONE FINAL ONE. IN THE INTEREST OF SUPPORTING WORKPLACE SAFETY, JOB SECURITY AND THE RIGHT OF EMPLOYEES TO ORGANIZE. SO THOSE WERE THE KINDS OF TOPICS THAT CITY COUNCIL HAS PREPARED POLICY AGENDA 4, AND IF THE PLANNING COMMISSION WOULD LIKE TO FORWARD ANY COMMENTS TO THEM, I WILL BE HAPPY TO ARRANGE THAT.
00:22:14.826: >> Vice Chair Mills: DO YOU WANT ONE NOW? BECAUSE I DO HAVE ONE. THAT'S COME BEFORE US BEFORE, AND ACTUALLY NOW THIS IS -- PART OF MY DAY JOB -- IT'S COMING UP. SOMETHING TO PROPOSE, ADVANCE AND MONITOR INITIATIVES THAT ALLOW MUNICIPALITIES TO EXCEED THE STATE'S ENERGY CODE. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU RECALL BEFORE THOSE OF YOU WHO WERE ON COMMISSION A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO, WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT TRYING TO -- WHAT OPTIONS WE HAD TO REQUIRE INCREASED ENERGY EFFICIENCY. RIGHT NOW, YOU CANNOT REQUIRE THAT IN NEW BUILDINGS. YOU CAN -- YOU CAN REQUIRE -- IF -- AS AN INCENTIVE, WHICH IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAD IN OUR -- IN OUR PREMIUMS, IS THAT IF YOU HAD MORE EFFICIENT BUILDINGS, YOU MIGHT GET A PREMIUM, BUT THE STATE'S ENERGY CODE DOESN'T LET YOU EXCEED IT. I THINK THAT THAT'S PARTICULARLY, AS COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL TALKED ABOUT, THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IF WE ARE GOING TO ACHIEVE OUR CARBON GOALS, OUR CARBON NEUTRALITY GOALS.
00:23:19.490: >> IN THAT CASE, I WOULD SUGGEST THAT SOMEONE WOULD LIKE TO MOVE TO RECOMMEND ALLOWING MUNICIPALITIES TO EXCEED THE ENERGY CODE AS AN INCLUSION OR A FOCUS AREA OF THE F.Y.-20-21 POLICY LEGISLATIVE AGENDA AND SOMEONE ELSE CAN SUPPORT THAT. COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN WILL MOVE THAT. THANK YOU. DOES -- DOES COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT, WE WILL PUT DOWN THE SECOND. I WILL LEARN IT. I DON'T KNOW WHY I HAVE A BLOCK. ANY DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR OF THIS MOTION, PLEASE SAY AYE. [CHORUS OF AYES] ANY OPPOSED? OKAY. I WOULD IMAGINE -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE TIMING OF THIS IS, BUT PARTICULARLY I THINK AS THE CARBON NEUTRALITY COMMISSION COMES INTO PLAY, I THINK THERE'S POTENTIALLY OTHER ROADBLOCKS THAT -- WELL, I KNOW THERE ARE OTHER ROADBLOCKS THAT DO NOT NECESSARILY HAVE TO DO EXACTLY WITH THE WORK THAT WE HAVE BEFORE US, THAT I THINK IT'S JUST HELPFUL TO PASS ALONG THAT THERE'S MORE ON CARBON -- ACHIEVING CARBON NEUTRALITY AND PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO SOME UTILITY POLICIES THAT I THINK MIGHT WANT TO BE ADDED ON THERE. OKAY. ANY -- OH, YES?
00:24:52.050: >> Commissioner Briggs: ARE YOU LOOKING FOR ALL OF THOSE SUGGESTIONS TONIGHT OR ARE THEY GOING TO BE MOVED FORWARD SOON OR --
00:25:00.925: >> I BELIEVE THAT THE -- THAT THE COUNCIL POLICY AGENDA COMMITTEE WILL BE MOVING FORWARD THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS TO COUNCIL FOR ADOPTION IN EARLY 2020. SO PERHAPS JANUARY OR FEBRUARY. I THINK WE MAY STILL HAVE MORE WINDOW OF TIME TO FORWARD ADDITIONAL SUGGESTIONS TO THEM, BUT I DON'T THINK WE HAVE A VERY GREAT WINDOW.
00:25:28.286: >> Commissioner Briggs: GREAT.
00:25:31.289: >> Chair Milshteyn: ANYTHING ELSE? --
00:25:33.891: >> Vice Chair Mills: ANYTHING ELSE? ANY OTHER COMMISSION PROPOSED BUSINESS? I JUST HAVE A QUESTION. THERE WAS SOMETHING WITHIN OUR PACKET ON A COMMENT FROM THE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE ABOUT THE C.I.P. AND I WAS JOUST WONDER -- AND I WAS JUST WONDERING IF YOU HAD ANY INFORMATION ON -- THE C.I.P. IS THE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS PLAN. I WAS WONDERING IF YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION ON WHEN WE WILL BE DISCUSSING THE C.I.P.
00:26:01.819: >> I PERSONALLY DO NOT HAVE THAT INFORMATION, BUT I CAN FOLLOW UP AND -- WITH AN EMAIL AS SOON AS POSSIBLE IF I CAN GET THAT ANSWERED THIS WEEK AND IF NOT, BY THE NEXT MEETING.
00:26:14.031: >> Vice Chair Mills: GREAT. IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE DISCUSSED EVERY YEAR. IT'S TYPICALLY WINTER, AND SO I KIND OF THINK SO. SO -- BUT I JUST WANTED TO -- BECAUSE IT WAS, YOU KNOW, IN THERE, IN CASE ANYBODY FROM THE
