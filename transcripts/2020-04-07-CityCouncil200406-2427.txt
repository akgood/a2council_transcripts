00:02:35.064: >> City Atty. Postema: IT WOULD BE BEFORE COUNCIL NEW BUSINESS, DC-3, I BELIEVE.

00:03:09.531: >> City Admin. Crawford: YES, MAYOR. A COUPLE OF COMMENTS, PLEASE.
00:03:12.935: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
00:03:13.769: >> City Admin. Crawford: SINCE OUR LAST MEETING SEVERAL WEEKS AGO, THE SPREAD OF THE CORONAVIRUS HAS HAD A BIG IMPACT ON THE WAY THE CITY DOES BUSINESS, ALTHOUGH COUNCIL AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY HAVE SHOWN APPRECIATION FOR STAFF, ESPECIALLY OUR POLICE, FIRE AND PUBLIC WORKS FOLKS, I WANTED TO TAKE A MINUTE AND RECOGNIZE THE MAGNITUDE OF WHAT STAFF HAS ACCOMPLISHED. WITHIN A VERY SHORT TIME, THE CITY WAS ABLE TO CLOSE CITY HALL, ENABLE THOSE WORKERS WHOSE JOBS ALLOW THEM TO WORK FROM HOME, TO DO SO. TRANSITION OUR OPERATIONS TO AN ESSENTIAL SERVICES-ONLY OPERATING MODEL AND INSTITUTE PRACTICES SUPPORTING THE LATEST HEALTH GUIDELINES. THESE CHANGES WOULD SIMPLY HAVE NOT BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE HELP OF DEDICATED, FLEXIBLE AND HARD-WORKING STAFF THAT WE HAVE AT THE CITY. ALSO, OUR STRONG CULTURE FOR SAFETY, AND HISTORICAL INVESTMENT IN OUR IT STAFF AND INFRASTRUCTURE. SO I JUST WANTED TO EXPRESS MY SINCERE APPRECIATION TO ALL OF THOSE INVOLVED. GREAT JOB. THANK YOU! WE ARE NOW ABOUT THREE WEEKS INTO DEALING WITH THE CORONAVIRUS, AND WE CLEARLY HAVE MORE WEEKS IN FRONT OF US. TODAY, THE IMPACT ON THE COMMUNITY HAS BEEN WIDE SPREAD AND DEEP. AND THE LONGER IT LASTS, THE MORE CHALLENGING WILL BE OUR RECOVERY, BOTH AS INDIVIDUALS AND AS BUSINESSES AND ORGANIZATIONS. AND IN THE MONTHS AHEAD, WE WILL START TALKING ABOUT THE CITY'S FINANCIAL STATUS AND BUDGET. THESE MONTHS WILL BE CHALLENGING AS WELL. BUT WITH SHARED SACRIFICE AND THOUGHTFUL DECISION MAKING, I'M CONFIDENT WE WILL REMAIN A STRONG ORGANIZATION. FOR THE PUBLIC'S REFERENCE, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF MEMORANDUMS ATTACHED TO THE AGENDA TONIGHT, AS THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR COMMUNICATION ITEM. SOME WERE ATTACHED RATHER LATE. I WANTED TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO THEM. AND LASTLY, AT THIS TIME, IN THE AGENDA, I USUALLY THANK ONE OF THE POLICE OFFICERS WHO ATTEND OUR COUNCIL MEETING. SINCE THIS IS A VIRTUAL MEETING, I WOULD LIKE TO CALL OUT AND RECOGNIZE ONE OF THE MANY EMPLOYEES WHO WORKED TO MAKE THIS VIRTUAL MEETING POSSIBLE AND THAT'S JEN FROM IT. SHE'S OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AND SECURITY MANAGER. THANKS, JEN! THAT'S ALL, MAYOR.
00:05:08.550: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU, MR. CRAWFORD. WE NOW COME TO PUBLIC COMMENT GENERAL TIME. PLEASE NOTE DURING PUBLIC COMMENT GENERAL TIME, IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO SPEAK TO COUNCIL AND THE COMMUNITY ABOUT MATTERS OF MUNICIPAL INTEREST. TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT GENERAL TEEM, ONE NEEDS TO HAVE SIGNED UP IN ADVANCE, BY CONTACTING OUR CITY CLERK. SPEAKERS HAVE THREE MINUTES IN WHICH TO SPEAK. SO PLEASE PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO YOUR OWN TIME CLOCK. OUR CLERK WILL NOTIFY YOU AT THE 30 SECOND POINT. PLEASE NOTE THAT NORMAL COUNCIL RULES APPLY, AS WELL AS CONSEQUENT PUBLIC HEARINGS. THE PHONE NUMBER AND MEETING ID TO CALL IN SHOULD BE DISPLAYED ON THE SCREEN PRESENTLY. CALLERS WILL BE CALLED ON ONE BY ONE BY THE CITY CLERK, USING THE LAST THREE DIGITS OF YOUR TELEPHONE NUMBER AND AN AUTOMATED ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE HOST IS ALLOWING YOU TO SPEAK. CALLERS WHO WOULD LIKE  TO SPEAK AT A PUBLIC HEARING -- DOWNSTREAM, I WILL GET TO THAT LATER. PLEASE, WHILE YOU ARE SPEAKING MOVE TO A QUIET AREA AND MUTINY TELEVISION OR BACKGROUND -- MUTE ANY TELEVISION OR BACKGROUND NOISE. THE CLERK WILL TELL YOU WILL WHEN YOUR TIME IS UP, AND YOU WILL BE PLACED ON MUTE TO MOVE ON TO THE NEXT SPEAKER. IF THERE ARE SPEAKERS NEW TO CITY COUNCIL, PUBLIC COMMENT IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENTS TO COUNCIL, CITY COUNCIL LISTENS, OF COURSE, BUT DOES NOT GENERALLY RESPOND. OUR FIRST SPEAKER TODAY, IS TIM HULL.
00:06:46.081: >> HI, TIM HULL HERE. I HOPE YOU ARE ALL STAYING HOME AND STAYING SAFE. AS SOMEONE WHO LIVES IN ANN ARBOR WITHOUT A CAR, ONE OF THE BIGGEST BARRIERS TO DOING SO IS A LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN DENSE AREAS DESIGNED FOR CAR-FREE LIVING. DOWNTOWN, WHILE TENSE, IS QUITE EXPENSIVE AND HOUSING OPTIONS ARE OVERWHELMINGLY STUDENT-ORIENTED. MAJOR CORRIDORS OUTSIDE OF DOWNTOWN SUCH AS PLYMOUTH, AND WASHTENAW HAVE AUTO-ORIENTED LANDS. AS SUCH, I WOULD LIKE TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO SUPPORT DC-2, I ARESOLUTION TO DIRECT THE PLANNING COMMISSION TO CREATE A TRANSIT-SUPPORTED DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT. THIS WILL PROVIDE A TOOL THAT ALLOW US TO OFFER MORE DENSITY ON MAJOR TRANSIT CORRIDORS FOR THOSE LIVING WITHOUT A CAR AND IT WILL HELP US TO INCREASE THE HOUSING SUPPLY IN OUR COMMUNITY AND BETTER SERVE THE EXISTING DEMAND AND OFFER A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF NEW UNITS OUTSIDE THE EXPENSIVE DOWNTOWN CORE. FINALLY BY HELPING TO SUPPORT LIVING WITHOUT A CAR THIS IS A CONCRETE STEP THE STATE COULD DO TO MAT MITIGATE CLIMATE CHANGE. I KNOW SOME QUESTION WHETHER WE CAN DO THAT WITH THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT ALL WORK ON OTHER ISSUES MUST STOP. AND THIS MERELY DIRECTS THE PLANNING COMMISSION TO DRAFT AN ORDINANCE. ALSO, SOME MAY QUESTION WHETHER WE SHOULD PROMOTE DENSITY AND TRANSIT GIVEN THE NEED FOR SOCIAL DISTANCING RIGHT NOW, AND THE DIFFICULTY FACED BY SOME DENSE COMMUNITIES WITH COVID-19 SUCH AS NEW YORK. HOWEVER, THIS WILL EVENTUALLY PASS AND BEYOND THAT, WE CAN SEE THAT SOME DENSE PLACES, LIKE SINGAPORE, HONG KONG HAVE DONE A BETTER JOB OF CONTAINING THE SPREAD THAN EVEN LIKE LESS DENSE PLACES. AND ALLOWING SOME MODERATE INCREASED DENSITY ON A FEW TRANSIT CORRIDORS IS A FAR CRY FROM TURNING TO NEW YORK OR ANY OF THESE PLACES IN ANY CASE. I HOPE YOU MOVE IN ORDER WITH THIS THE PANDEMIC MAY REQUIRE IMMEDIATE ACTION BUT THAT DOESN'T DIMINISH THE NEED FOR OTHER ACTION, SUCH AS CLIMATE CHANGE, NOT TO MENTION THE NEEDS OF THOSE WHO CAN'T, SHOULDN'T AND DON'T WANT TO DRIVE, WHICH REALLY NEEDS TO BE CONSIDERED IN THE TIME OF PANDEMIC, BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE SOMETIMES THEY ARE, IN FACT, OVERLOOKED WITH THE EMPHASIS ON SOCIAL DISTANCING. WE HAVE DRIVE UPS, DRIVE-IN, EVERYTHING AND WE NEED TO ACTUALLY PAY ATTENTION TO THAT. THANKS.
00:09:21.503: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS KAI PETAINEN.
00:09:30.345: >> TAKING CARE OF THEMSELVES.
00:09:33.181: >> HI, CAN YOU HEAR US?
00:09:34.816: >> YEAH, I CAN. I HOPE YOU CAN HEAR ME. CITY COUNCIL, I HOPE FOLKS ARE OKAY IN TAKING CARE OF THEMSELVES. MY THANKS TO EACH OF YOU FOR SERVING THE PUBLIC IN AUDILE ADIFFICULT TIME. I'M SURE THAT EPPIE POTTS. IF I COULD LIVE TO 95 AND DRIVE PASSION IN LOCAL ISSUES IT WOULD BE REMARKABLE AND FRANKLY LUCKY. I HOPE THAT EPPIE CAN BE ACKNOWLEDGED IN SOME SIGNIFICANT WAY, SOME PLACE THAT'S NAMED AFTER HER OR THE EPPIE POTTS CITIZEN AWARD. I HOPE IT CAN BE DOPPLER RADAR. I DIDN'T -- I HOPE IT CAN BE DONE. I HOPE HER FAMILY AND FRIENDS HAVE SOMETHING THAT'S MEANINGFUL AND APPROPRIATE. I KNOW SHE DID A LOT MORE IN THOSE THREE-MINUTE TALKS BUT THAT IS THE PORTION I KNOW HER FROM. IT'S INTO IS TO SEE SOME ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF HER BY COUNCIL BUT I HOPE SOMETHING ELSE CAN BE DONE IN THE FUTURE AS WELL. I HOPE OTHERS IN THE FUTURE COULD  BE ACKNOWLEDGED. I DO KNOW THAT ALONG WITH EPPIE, ROGER RAIL IS SOMEONE WHO HAS LED A CITY OF ACTIVISM. I'M SURE EPPIE WAS A FRIEND TO MANY OF YOU AND MY DEEPEST CONDOLENCES TO HER FAMILY, FRIENDS AND MANY OF YOU AS WELL ON CITY COUNCIL. MY BEST WISHES AND HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.
00:11:00.702: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS ALAN HABER.
00:11:10.078: >> AM I HAVE MUTED? HELLO, COUNCIL. I'M GLAD TO SEE THIS ARRAY. IT'S EVEN BETTER THAN IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM. WE ADAPT TO THE STRANGE SITUATION. SO I WAS SIGNED UP TO DO -- AND REALLY, I SUPPORT WHAT KAI SAID ABOUT EPPIE. SHE WAS A GREAT LADY. I WILL MISS HER. I CERTAINLY WILL. I HAD SIGNED UP AT THE LAST MEETING, AND A CLERICAL ERROR LEFT ME OFF THE LIST AND I WAS TO -- I WANTED TO GIVE SUPPORT AND HONOR TO THE PRESENTATION OF THE TASK FORCE THAT WAS BEING GIVEN TO YOU, AND CALL YOUR ATTENTION TO THE APPENDICES THERE AND ALL THE INFORMATION ON THE COMMENTS. IT WAS A GREAT LEARNING EXPERIENCE FOR ALL OF US ON THE TASK FORCE FOR SEVEN MONTHS AND MANY, MANY MEETINGS. AND I WANTED TO INCLUDE YOU THEN ALSO IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PLANNING FOR THE EARTH DAY CELEBRATION FROM APRIL 19th TO 26th:  IT'S STILL AT THAT TIME THAT WE THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE, YOU KNOW, PHYSICAL BUT NOW IS CLEARLY VIRTUAL. AND SO, WE ARE INTENDING IN THE VIRTUAL LIVESTREAMING WORLD TO BRING PERSPECTIVE ON EARTH DAY, THE URGENCIES OF THIS PLAGUE, BUT THE OTHER PLAGUES OF THE GLOBAL WARMING AND THE CALAMITIES THAT'S BRINGING AND THE -- A THOUSAND SECONDS TO DOOMSDAY THE NUCLEAR WAR. SO ALL OF THESE QUESTIONS AROUND THE TABLE, AND WE'RE TRYING TO PUT TOGETHER A GLOBAL TEACHING AND A VIRTUAL EVENT AND I HOPE THAT COUNCIL PEOPLE AND THE PUBLIC WILL BECOME INVOLVED. THE ABSENCE OF PHYSICAL CONNECTION GIVES A GREATER OPPORTUNITY IN THE SENSE FOR SOCIAL SOLIDARITY. AND SO THIS IS REALLY AN INVITATION TO THE COUNCIL AND THE COMMUNITY HOW TO DO WE ADAPT IN THIS TIME TO REALLY SEE THE POSSIBILITIES OF ENERGY, AND BECOMING MORE OF A COMMONS AND WORKING TOGETHER TO DEAL WITH THE BIG PROBLEMS AND KEEPING OURSELVES SAFE WITH THE LITTLE ONES AND USING THE EMPTY LOT COMMONS AS A PLACE TO PROJECT THE IDEAS THAT WE COULD MAKE REAL IN THE FUTURE. SO THE FESTIVAL OF IDEAS THAT WE IMAGINED THAT REALLY BRINGING THE IDEAS IN THE VIRTUAL WORLD AND SEEING WHAT ARE THE WAYS FORWARD FOR THE COMMUNITY WITH THIS OPPORTUNITY OF THE COMMONS AND MUTUAL AID AND THE COOPERATIVE ECONOMY IS REALLY SOMETHING THAT WE CAN BEGIN.
00:13:56.111: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
00:13:58.046: >> SO I HAVE 30 SECONDS AND I JUST CONGRATULATE YOU ALL FOR KEEPING CALM IN THE MIDST OF THIS AND I HOPE THAT YOU WILL GIVE RECOGNITION TO THE GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING. THE TASK FORCE DIDN'T REALLY PUT TOGETHER, WELL, WHAT DO YOU DO NEXT? AND WELL, WHAT YOU DO NEXT IS RECOGNIZE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE MAKING SOMETHING HAPPEN THERE, AND I SENT YOU A DRAFT RESOLUTION TO THAT EFFECT. SO ALL GOOD WISHES AND VIRTUAL EARTH DAY SHOULD BRING US TOGETHER WITH A HIGHER CONSCIOUSNESS.
00:14:34.349: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS MOZHGAN SAVABIEASFAHANI.
00:14:41.222: >> MAYOR, I HAVE ONE PHONE NUMBER LEFT, AND IT IS NOT THE NUMBER FOR THE NEXT TWO SPEAKERS. WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO CHECK ON THE NUMBER.
00:14:54.002: >> HI, WERE YOU CALLING IN FOR PUBLIC COMMENT?
00:14:57.138: >> YES, MY NAME IS MOZHGAN SAVABIEASFAHANI.
00:15:01.643: >> GO AHEAD. CAN YOU HEAR ME?
00:15:03.778: >> Clerk Beaudry: YES, GO AHEAD.
00:15:05.613: >> OKAY. IF THIS COVID-19 CRISIS HAS TAUGHT US ANYTHING, IT IS THIS: HUMAN SOLIDARITY SAVES MILLIONS OF LIVES. SEE MY CAMPAIGN INDIVIDUAL AT VOTEFORTHEDOCTOR.COM. ANN ARBOR CITY COUNCIL'S RECORD SHOWS THAT IT DOESN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT SOLIDARITY MEANS. SOLIDARITY MEANS WORKING TO PROTECT THE MOST VULNERABLE. ANN ARBOR CITY COUNCIL HAS REED TO PROTECT THE MOST VULNERABLE, GLOBALLY AND LOCALLY. GLOBALLY, YOU HAVE REFUSED TO PROTECT THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE, EVEN NOW AS ISRAEL IS DEPOLISHING THE PALESTINIAN COVID-19 CLINIC. DO YOU STILL WANT TO GIVE $38 BILLION TO ISRAEL, MONEY THAT IS DESPERATELY NEEDED RIGHT HERE OR WILL YOU FINALLY SAY NO TO MILITARY AID TO ISRAEL. RIGHT HERE IN ANN ARBOR, RIGHT HERE IN ANN ARBOR, YOU HAVE ABANDONED THE MOST VULNERABLE. 48% OF THOSE HOSPITALIZED DUE TO COVID-19 ARE AFRICAN AMERICAN! HOW COULD YOU LET THAT HAPPEN? I WAS THE ONLY ONE TO INSIST ON FIELD HOSPITALS TO CONTAIN THE PANDEMIC. WHERE WERE YOU, JACK EATON? FORTUNATELY, JEFF HAYNER MADE INQUIRIES AND THE FIELD HOSPITALS ARE COMING TO ANN ARBOR. DESPITE YOUR MEANINGLESS SQUABBLING ABOUT THE HOUSING CRISIS, YOU HAVE TOTALLY ABANDONED ANN ARBORRITES WHEN IT COMES TO AFFORDABLE PUBLIC HOUSING. YOU HAVE ELIMINATED A TINY BIT OF PUBLIC HOUSING WHICH ANN ARBOR ONCE HAD. INSTEAD, YOU HAVE STARTED A HOUSING VOUCHER GAME THAT LEAVES THOUSANDS WITHOUT DECENT HOUSING. YOU ABANDONED ANN ARBORRITES WHEN IT COMES TO $15 MILLION MINIMUM WAGE. NO ONE ON THIS COUNCIL HAS EVER FOUGHT FOR $15 MINIMUM WAGE? INSTEAD, YOU SETTLE FOR A PUNY LIVING WAGE LAW THAT COVERS ONLY A TINY FRACTION OF THE WORKFORCE, A LIVING WAGE LAW IS NO REPLACEMENT FOR THE $15 MINIMUM PAGE, WHICH I AM DEMANDING FOR EVERY WORKER IN ANN ARBOR. THAT INCLUDES EVERY WORKER WHO HAS BEEN FORCED TO UNEMPLOYMENT. TONIGHT, DC-3 PROPOSAL IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF ABANDONED MOST A ANN ARBORRITES. 55% OF ANN ARBOR RESIDENTS ARE RENTERS. YOUR DC-3 WOULD ONLY PROTECT 112 TENANTS FROM EVICTION. THAT WILL LEAVE THE MAJORITY OF ANN ARBOR WITH ZERO PROTECTION FROM EVICTION.
00:17:31.326: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
00:17:35.797: >> MR. EATON, IF YOU WILL NOT FIGHT FOR THE $15 MINUTE WAGE, IF YOU WILL NOT FIGHT FOR GOOD PUBLIC HOUSING THEN GET OFF THAT SEAT. I WILL SHOW YOU HOW IT'S DONE. IF YOU HAVE NO COMPASSION FOR PALESTINIAN PEOPLE AND HAPPY TO FOOT THE BILL FOR THE ENSLAVEMENT, THEN GET OFF THAT SEAT. YOU JUST DON'T HAVE THE HUMANITY TO SIT THERE OR AT LEAST GET YOURSELF ON THE BALLOT SO I CAN BEAT YOU FAIR AND SQUARE AT ELECTION TIME. THANK YOU. CLERK TIME.
00:18:02.323: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS BLAINE COLEMAN.
00:18:07.362: >> OKAY. I'M READY TO GET STARTED AS SOON AS YOU ARE READY. THIS IS BLAINE COLEMAN.
00:18:12.433: >> Mayor Taylor: PLEASE BEGIN.
00:18:13.568: >> Clerk Beaudry: GO AHEAD.
00:18:15.536: >> OKAY. I THINK THAT DR. SAVABIEASFAHANI'S COMMENTS ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT ON. WHY ON EARTH WERE ALL THE CITY COUNCILMEMBERS NOT STANDING ON THE TABLE DEMANDING FIELD HOSPITALS BE SET UP IN ANN ARBOR NOW? YOU KNOW THE REGULAR HOSPITALS ARE GOING TO BE OVERWHELMED. WHY DID IT TAKE DR. SAVABIEASFAHANI TO WALK INTO YOUR MEETING MARCH 16th AND DEMAND FIELD HOSPITALS? WHY WAS IT LEFT TO HER? WHY WERE NONE OF YOU DOING THAT? NOW, FORTUNATELY, AS SHE MENTIONED, COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER DID STEP UP AFTER THAT, AND HE DID MAKE A LOT OF INQUIRIES AND I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED THAT THE REASON THAT WE ARE GETTING FIELD HOSPITALS NOW IS BECAUSE OF THEIR EFFORTS, DR. SAVABIEASFAHANI AND COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER. BUT THE INACTION FROM THE REST OF YOU IS REALLY STRIKING. WHAT IS A CITY COUNCIL FOR, IF NOT TO TRY TO SAVE OUR LIVES HERE IN ANN ARBOR? YOU KNOW, CLEANUP OF THE GELMAN DIOXANE PLUME, RIGHT THIS MINUTE. WHY IS NOBODY ON THE COUNCIL PUSHING FOR THAT? NOBODY? NOBODY. WHY? AFFORDABLE HOUSING, WHY IS EVERYBODY ON THE CITY COUNCIL TALKING ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUT ABSOLUTELY NOBODY IS DOING ANYTHING TO MAKE IT HAPPEN? THAT MEANS PUBLIC HOUSING. GOOD, PUBLIC HOUSING THAT EVERYONE HAS ACCESS TO. WHY IS NO ONE IN THE CITY COUNCIL MAKING THAT HAPPEN? WHY IS NOBODY ON THE CITY COUNCIL PUSHING LOUDLY FOR THE $15 AN HOUR MINIMUM WAGE? WHY IS NOBODY ON THE CITY COUNCIL ADVOCATING FOR THIS SIMPLE HUMANITARIAN RESOLUTION TO END MILITARY AID TO ISRAEL? AS ISRAEL GUNS DOWN PEACEFUL PROTESTERS, AS ISRAEL ACTUALLY DEMOLISHES A COVID-19 CLINIC THAT THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE WERE SETTING UP, WHY IS IT THAT THE CITY COUNCIL IS LOCALLY AND GLOBALLY COMPLETELY DEAF, DUMB AND BLIND TO HUMAN RIGHTS, TO ENVIRONMENTAL RIGHTS. WHY? EVEN TO PUBLIC ELIMINATE HEALTH RIGHTS OF PEOPLE WHO LIVE HERE. SO I HOPE THAT DR. SAVABIEASFAHANI WILL GET ELECTED TO WARD 4. I HOPE YOU LOOK AT HER WEBSITE.
00:20:44.419: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
00:20:45.787: >> YEAH. AS I WAS SAYING, I HOPE YOU LOOK TO HER WEBSITE AND VOTEFORTHEDOCTOR.COM. AGAIN, VOTEFORTHEDOCTOR.COM. YOU CAN ALSO SEE HER CAMPAIGN VIDEO RIGHT AT THAT SITE. VOTEFORTHEDOCTOR.COM THANKS FOR HEARING ME OUT AND IF COUNCILMEMBERS HAVE ANY COMMENTS FOR ME, I'M ALL EARS.
00:21:17.518: >> Clerk Beaudry: TIME.
00:21:18.252: >> THANK YOU.
00:21:18.853: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. ARE THERE COMMUNICATIONS TODAY FROM COUNCIL? COUNCILMEMBER NELSON?
00:21:24.826: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I PROMISED MY HUSBAND I WOULD MAKE A SHOUT OUT TO AN ORGANIZATION HE'S GOTTEN INVOLVED IN WITH THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS CALLED -- I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS COMING OUT BACKWARDS ON YOUR VIDEO, IT'S --
00:21:41.042: >> Councilmember Griswold:  IT LOOKS GOOD.
00:21:43.478: >> Councilmember Nelson:  OH, GOOD. YOU CAN FIND OUT ABOUT USING 3D PRINTERS TO CREATE PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT FOR HEALTHCARE WORKERS. WE HAVE NOW TWO 3D PRINTERS RUNNING IN ANY HOUSE ALL DAY LONG PRINTING THESE THINGS. IT'S REALLY EXCITING THAT THIS PROJECT WAS STARTED BY KEVIN LEASER IN THE 5th WARD AND THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE COMING TOGETHER. SOME OF THESE -- SOME OF THE EQUIPMENT THAT THEY ARE MAKING IS BEING FLOWN ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO PENNSYLVANIA AND ALL -- AND INDIANA AND ALL KINDS OF PLACES. AND SO, AGAIN, IF YOU HAVE A 3D PRINTER AT YOUR HOUSE, IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN GETTING INVOLVED THIS IS THE WEBSITE TO VISIT, PROTECT-MI.ORG. THANKS.
00:22:29.123: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
00:22:30.024: >> Councilmember Griswold: THANK YOU. I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE WHO HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN SUPPORTING OUR COMMUNITY DURING THESE DIFFICULT TIMES. THE CITY STAFF, I WANT TO SHOUT OUT TO JEN GRIMES. SHE HELPS ME WITH A COUPLE OF TECHNICAL QUESTIONS I HAD BEFORE CAUCUS YESTERDAY. AND WHAT I WANT TO SAY IS THERE'S SO MUCH THAT'S BEING DONE WITH PEOPLE AT THE CITY LEVEL WORKING WITH COUNTY, WORKING WITH THE STATE, WORKING WITH OUR FEDERAL REPRESENTATIVE, CONGRESSWOMAN DEBBIE DINGLE GIVES AN EMAIL UPDATE EVERY DAY. THE GOVERNOR GIVES AN UPDATE EVERY DAY. AND SO FROM THE COMMUNITY'S PERSPECTIVE, IT MAY NOT LOOK LIKE WE'RE DOING THAT MUCH, BUT I CAN TELL YOU WE ARE AND I WANT TO INVITE ANYONE WHO HAS A QUESTION TO CALL ME OR EMAIL ME. MY INFORMATION IS ON THE CITY WEBSITE, AND I CAN GET YOU TO THE RIGHT PERSON WHO GET YOU THE ANSWER THAT YOU NEED. THE OTHER THING I WANT TO SAY IS THAT IF THERE'S ANY LESSON LEARNED FROM THIS PANDEMIC, FOR WHAT'S HAPPENED IN THE UNITED STATES, IT'S THAT WE MUST GET IT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME. AND THAT MEANS A DISCIPLINED PROCESS. AND I HOPE THAT WE CAN APPLY THAT LESSON TO CITY GOVERNMENT. THANK YOU.
00:23:58.145: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
00:24:00.281: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. FIRST OF ALL, I WOULD LIKE TO SEND WELL-WISHES TO EVERYBODY OUT THIS IN VIRTUAL LAND AND THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR AND ALL OVER STATE AND THANK EVERYBODY FOR DOING WHAT THEY CAN TO PUT THIS DOWN AND STAY HOME AND PRACTICE PHYSICAL DISTANCING. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. IT APPEARS AND I'M HOPEFUL THAT WE ARE STARTING TO SEE THIS ROLLOVER OF THE CURVE AND IT HOOKS LIKE WE ARE TRYING TO DO A GOOD JOB AND IT LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE SUCCEEDED. I'M SORRY THAT SOME OF MY CONSTITUENTS OUT THERE THAT I DON'T HAVE A COVID-19 OMNIBUS RELIEF PACKAGE PREPARED. WE HAD SOME TALK ABOUT THAT AND I HAD SOME GOOD CONVERSATIONS WITH FOLKS AT CITY STAFF AND MR. CRAWFORD AND SO ON ABOUT THIS. THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THE CITY CAN DO AND THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THE CITY CAN'T DO. AND THE CITY CAN'T DO, WE ARE ASKING THE STATE TO DO FOR US AND WE HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH THE STATE, WITH THE UNIVERSITY, WITH ALL THE -- ALL THE WAY UP AND DOWN THE GOVERNMENTAL CHAIN. AND I'M CONVINCED THAT WE'RE DOING A LOT OF THOSE THINGS AND WE'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING BEES. THE CITY CAN'T FREEZE PEOPLE'S RENT AND THE CITY CAN'T STOP COLLECTING PROPERTY TAXES. AND THE VERDICT IS OUT THAT THE CITY CAN DISCOUNT WATER RATES. BUT I KNOW WHAT WE CAN DO AND WE CAN BOOST THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT'S DEDICATED TO THE WATER RELIEF FUND BECAUSE WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO DO THE RIGHT HYGIENE PRACTICES AT HOME, TO WASH THEIR HANDS AND DO THE EXTRA WASHING OF CLOTHES. WE THINK THE WATER CONSUMPTION WILL GO UP, EVEN THOUGH IT PLUMMETS FOR SOME OF THE COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS AND ESPECIALLY THE UNIVERSITY. AND SO WE WILL BE TAKING A BIG HIT IN WATER REVENUES, BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE DON'T CARE ABOUT THE COMMUNITY AND WE WANT YOU TO USE THE WATER AND WE'LL GET BACK TO BOOSTING THIS WATER RELIEF FUND AND HOMEFULLY STREAMLINE THE WAY TO APPLY FOR IT. WE CAN WAVE LICENSING FEES AND EXTEND THE LICENSES. WE HAVE DONE SOME OF THAT. I WANT TO ASK PAC AND PARKS TO CONSIDER SETTING ASIDE SPACE FOR COMMUNITY GARDENS THIS YEAR, SOMETHING THAT WE HAVEN'T REALLY DONE BEFORE IN OUR PARKS BUT I THINK IT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER, AND ALSO MESHES NICELY WITH THE CLIMATE ACTION PLAN TO LOOK AT FOOD SELF-RELIANCE AND EXISTENCE. WE CAN FUND THE HOMELESS SHELTER AND WE ARE DOING SOME OF THAT. I KNOW WE HAVE WAIVED THE PARKING FEES -- OR WE HAVE BAGGED A BUNCH OF PARKING FOR THE HOSPITAL FOR THE UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL STAFF AND DOCTORS AND I'M REALLY APPRECIATIVE OF THAT EFFORT AND I THINK WE SHOULD JUST FORGET TRYING TO COLLECT ON THAT. I THINK WE SHOULD JUST WAIVE THAT AND DO AS MUCH AS WE CAN TO HELP OUT AROUND THAT. I KNOW A LOT OF PAs OVER THERE ARE WORKING OVER THERE AND NOT GETTING PAID. I APPRECIATE WHAT THE HEALTHCARE FOLKS ARE DOING. I WOULD LIKE TO FACILITATE MORE REMOTE MEETINGS. I THINK THERE'S NO REASON TO HALT THIS ACTIVITY ONCE IT GETS OUR ZOOM WORKING PROPERLY AND IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S WORKING PRETTY WELL FOR US TONIGHT. I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO ASK THE STAFF AND -- TO CONSIDER USING OUR VOTER RECORDS TO DETERMINE IF THERE'S WELLNESS NEEDS IN OUR COMMUNITIES. WE KNOW THAT WITH OUR VOTING RECORDS, WE HAVE AGES OF FOLKS AND CONTACT INFORMATION. AND I THINK IT WOULD BE NICE OF US TO EITHER SHARE THAT WITH SOME OF THE COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE DOING THE AID AND THE OUTREACH OR DO THAT DIRECTLY OURSELVES. I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE CITY CAN DO AND PROVIDE HEM FOR RESIDENTS AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS AND I THINK WE CAN PLACE A MORATORIUM ON WORK IN THE RIGHT-OF-WAY. I WOULD LIKE TO WISH EVERYONE WELL. THANK YOU.
00:27:43.270: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
00:27:45.873: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I WOULD LIKE TO RECOGNIZE EPPIE POTTS WHO PASSED AWAY. DAWE TO COVID-19, WE ARE LIMITED IN HOW WE PAY OUR RESPECTS TO THOSE WHO CURRENTLY PASS AWAY. IT'S JUST ANOTHER TRAGEDY THAT'S GOING ON. SO IF IT -- IF I COULD, I WOULD LIKE TO ASK FOR A MOMENT OF SILENCE FOR EPPIE POTTS AND THEN I WILL CONTINUE WITH THE VERBAL COMMUNICATION. THANK YOU. [ MOMENT OF SILENCE ] THANK YOU. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW, EPPIE WAS A PILLAR IN OUR COMMUNITY AND THREE MINUTES OR HOW MUCH TIME WE HAVE WOULDN'T COME CLOSE TO TOUCHING EVERYTHING AND EVERYBODY THAT SHE HAS TOUCHED. SO I APPRECIATE GIVING ME THAT MOMENT AND GIVING US, THE COMMUNITY A MOMENT TO REFLECT ON HER AND HER ACCOMPLISHMENTS. I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO THANK TOM CRAWFORD IN THIS VERY DIFFICULT TIME, JUMPING FROM WHERE HE WAS PRIOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO AND TO HIS ROLE AS INTERIM CITY ADMINISTRATOR AND THEN NOW BEING DEALT ONE OF THE BIGGEST CRISES OUR NATION HAS EVER FACED. SO NOT AN EASY TASK . AS A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER, I KNOW IT'S BEEN A CHALLENGE TO ADJUST EVERY DAY TO ALL SORTS OF NEEDS THAT YOU DON'T ANTICIPATE. AND HIM DOING IT IN A WAY WITH AGILITY AND BEING RESPONSIBLE AND PUTTING THE SAFETY AND THE WELFARE OF ANN ARBOR EMPLOYEES FIRST AND FOREMOST. AND AS WE HEAR A LOT OF TIMES, SERVING IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR IS NOT REWARDING. IT'S NOT -- YOU YOU ARE BETTER OFF BEING IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND BEING A PRIVATE CONTRACTOR, LET'S SAY, OR SOMETHING. I THINK TOM CRAWFORD HAS SHOWN THE VALUE OF WORKING FOR A COMMUNITY LIKE ANN ARBOR AND THE BENEFITS THAT YOU GET AND AN EMPLOYER THAT LOOKS OUT FOR YOU THE WAY THAT THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR HAS LOOKED OUT FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES THESE LAST FEW WEEKS. I CHALLENGE THOSE PEOPLE THAT SAY THAT SERVING THE PUBLIC INVESTIGATOR IS NOT WORTH IT. JUST BY THAT EXAMPLE. I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO THANK A COUPLE OF PEOPLE IN MY WARD, KEVIN LESSER, AS ELIZABETH NELSON, COUNCILMEMBER, POINTED OUT HAS BEEN ACTIVELY MAKING SHIELDS FOR THE HEALTHCARE WORKERS NONSTOP OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS. SUSAN SCHMIDT MADE THESE SIGNS FOR THE 5th WARD AND THE COMMUNITY TO SHOW HER APPRECIATION. SO JUST A FEW THINGS I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT AND MAKE SURE THAT THESE THINGS ARE NOTICED AND ACKNOWLEDGED AND APPRECIATED. WE HAVE HEARD FROM A LOT OF PEOPLE ABOUT RELIEF, AND COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER HAS TALKED ABOUT IT A L LITTLE BIT ALREADY. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT IN THESE TIME OF CRISIS TO STAY IN OUR LANE AND BE THERE WHEN PEOPLE IS ASKED FOR AND WE ARE ABLE TO OFFER IT. I THINK A LOT OF WHAT IS BEING ASKED CAN ONLY ON DONE BY LARGER GREATER AGENCIES. IT'S GOOD TO SEE SOME OF THAT HAPPENING BUT THERE'S STILL A DUST STORM OUT THERE. WE DON'T REALLY KNOW THE PROBLEMS THAT EXIST, AND I URGE JUST PATIENCE FROM THE COMMUNITY AND BUSINESS, TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE RAMIFICATIONS ARE BEFORE WE PUT A FIX TO IT. I DON'T WANT TO PUT GOOD MONEY ON TOP OF A DUMPSTER FIRE. I WOULD RATHER WAIT TO KNOW WHAT WE ARE PUTTING OUR RESOURCES TO, BECAUSE OUR RESOURCES ARE VERY SCARCE. SO WE DO KNOW THAT THESE PROBLEMS EXIST AND AS MR. HAYNER HAS MENTION, THE WATER SYSTEM IS MAYBE AN AREA THAT WE CAN HELP IN. I HAVE PROPOSED AN IDEA TO COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER EARLIER ABOUT IT AND I WILL FLOAT THE IDEA LATER WHEN THERE'S MORE TIME FOR IT. ONE THING I WOULD LIKE TO SAY IS THAT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO GET BETTER COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE D.D.A. I THINK THAT'S ONE AREA NOW THAT WE HAVE STRUGGLED WITH, ESPECIALLY EARLY ON WITH THE STAY IN PLACE ORDER, AND THE ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE D.D.A., UNILATERALLY. THEY TAKE -- THEY ARE TAKING ACTIONS UNILATERALLY ON OUR PARKING SYSTEM, WHICH THEY HAVE AUTHORITY TO DO, TO A CERTAIN EXTENT BUT WE HAVE TO REMIND EVERYBODY THAT THIS IS A BILATERAL AGREEMENT. THE DECISIONS ARE MACK MADE THAT EFFECT THE CITY COUNCIL'S REVENUES, EFFECT OUR ABILITY TO PURSUE POLICY. SO I WOULD URGE THAT WE HAVE A BETTER LINE OF COMMUNICATION WITH THE LEADERSHIP AT THE D.D.A. SO WE HAVE A COHESIVE UNDERSTANDING OF OUR PARKING POLICY, AND THE FINANCIAL CONSEQUENCES THAT ARE -- THAT ARE A RESULT OF THOSE CHANGES IN POLICY THAT ARE BEING DONE WITHOUT BILATERAL UNDERSTANDING. SO I DO AGREE WITH OUR COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER AS WELL, THAT WE NEED TO GET OUR BACK TO WORK WITH OUR BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS. I FEEL THAT THAT'S WHERE A LOT OF WORK GETS DONE FOR THE COMMUNITY AND WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO MEET. I KNOW I SERVE ON NINE DIFFERENT BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS. I HAVE ONLY BEEN ABLE TO MEET WITH ONE, I THINK MAYBE TWO SINCE THE OUTBREAK. SO IT'S IMPORTANT, I THINK, TO GET THOSE THINGS BACK RUNNING AS FAST AS POSSIBLE. I APPRECIATE THE TIME YOU HAVE GIVEN ME TO TALK. THANK YOU.
00:35:29.903: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
00:35:31.171: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. THANKS TO EVERYONE AND THANKS TO THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY FOR EVERYTHING THAT -- IT'S BEEN ALL HANDS ON DECK. EVERYONE HAS BEEN DOING, AND I TOO WOULD JUST LIKE TO CHIME IN AND EXTEND MY THANKS AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT TO TOM CRAWFORD AND HIS ENTIRE TEAM FOR DOING AN OUTSTANDING JOB, ENJOYING THE KIND OF LEADERSHIP THAT'S NEEDED, PARTICULARLY AT A TIME LIKE THIS. HE'S NOT FAILED AND, IN FACT, HE'S BEEN VERY CALM AND PROFESSIONAL THROUGHOUT AND HELPFUL WHEN ANY -- WHEN ANY QUESTION, REQUEST HAS BEEN POSED TO HIM, NOT ONLY BY OURSELVES BUT BY MANY MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY. SO I WOULD LIKE TO ADD MY THANKS TO YOU, TOM, AND YOU ARE THE ONE ON THE CITY TEAM WHO HAS STEPPED UP. AND TO OUR FIRST RESPONDERS, THEY ARE OBVIOUSLY TRULY ON THE FRONT LINES AND I KNOW WE ALL GREATLY APPRECIATE THAT THEY ARE THERE AND SERVING AND SACRIFICING THEMSELVES OVER THEIR SERVICE TO OTHERS. SO WE ALL GREATLY APPRECIATE EVERYTHING THAT THEY ARE DOING. THERE ARE SIMILAR ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE DOING THINGS A BIT MORE QUIETLY, PERHAPS. I WILL JUST NOTE THAT DESTINATION ANN ARBOR, THE ANN ARBOR CONVENTION BUREAU, IMMEDIATELY JUMPED INTO ACTION WHEN THE REQUESTS WERE MADE TO ADDRESS MANY OF THESE REQUESTS TO ADDRESS CONCERNS ABOUT CROWDING AT THE  DOHONIS CENTER, AND THE ANN ARBOR VISITOR BUREAU AND THEY QUICKLY AND IMMEDIATELY REACHED OUT TO THE HOTEL NETWORK AND WORKED WITH THE COUNTY TO MAKE ARRANGEMENTS BOTH FOR -- TO ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS AND ALSO TO HOUSE OUR HOTELS, WHO ARE NOW HOUSING MANY HEALTHCARE WORKERS. THEY CAN'T GO HOME. AND THEY ARE -- SO THAT INDUSTRY, WHICH IS SUFFERING AS WELL, IS HELPING IN, AGAIN, MANY WAYS. THE U OF M MEDICAL CENTER, OBVIOUSLY, HAS DONE A LOT TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE ABOUT THE NEED FOR ADDING BEDS AND OFFSITE FIELD HOSPITALS AND CAPACITY AND THEY HAVE -- IN SPEAKING WITH SOME FOLKS AT THE U OF M MEDICAL CENTER AND MR. CRAWFORD, AGAIN, THEY HAVE BEEN PLANNING FOR THIS, FOR YEARS FRANKLY, AND THEY HAVE BEEN WELL PREPARED AND THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND I SIMPLY SAY THIS TO REASSURE THOSE IN THE COMMUNITY WHO MIGHT FEAR THAT THEY WERE NOT PREPARED FOR THIS. THEY WERE AND ARE. IN TERMS OF WATER RATES, THE PROPOSAL THAT WE ADOPTED, I THINK, PEOPLE ARE NOW FEELING THE PAIN OF THE PROPOSAL THAT WE ADOPTED NOT ALL THAT LONG IN AGO, AND IT WAS A REVENUE NEUTRAL PROPOSAL. BUT WHAT IT DID WAS SHI SHIFTEDT SHARING TO THE RESIDENTS. AND THE -- BASICALLY PEOPLE PAY A LOT MORE IF THEY CONSUME MORE WATER. AGAIN, IT'S REVENUE NEUTRAL, AND THAT WAS IMPORTANT, AND IS IMPORTANT BUT WHAT WE COULD DO IS REVISIT THOSE TIERS BECAUSE PEOPLE NOW AGAIN ARE GETTING -- THEY ARE SEEING HOW COSTLY THIS IS FOR THEM, NOW THAT THEY ARE CONFINED AT HOME AND CONSUMING MORE WATER. SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE EVERYONE OUT THERE TO REACH OUT TO THEIR COUNCILMEMBERS TO ENCOURAGE US TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO ADDRESS -- TO ADR. ADDRESS THAT. THANK YOU ALL AND THANK YOU TO MS. BEAUDRY, MS. GRIMES, MS. HIGGINS, EVERYONE WHO MADE TONIGHT'S MEETING POSSIBLE AND FOR PREPARING US AND WALKING US THROUGH THIS SO WE CAN DO THIS THIS EVENING. THANK YOU.
00:39:57.537: >> Mayor Taylor: I HAVE COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER AND THEN GRAND IN THE QUEUE, BUT BEFORE THAT, MS. BEAUDRY.
00:40:03.977: >> Clerk Beaudry: YES, I JUST WANTED TO LET EVERYONE KNOW, WE ARE HAVING A TECHNICAL ISSUE WITH THE VIDEO AND SEVERAL OF THE YOU PAUSED YOUR VIDEO AND WERE UNABLE TO UNPAUSE IT. SO WE'RE ASKING IF IT'S NOT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY, DON'T TURN THE VIDEO ON AND OFF. IT SEEMS TO BE NO PROBLEM MUTING YOUR MICROPHONE, BUT WE WERE HAVING TROUBLE GETTING PEOPLE BACK WITH TURNING VIDEO OFF.
00:40:28.335: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. COUNCILMEMBER GRAND. I'M SORRY, MY MISTAKE. COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
00:40:33.773: >> Councilmember Bannister: OKAY. THANKS. I JUST HAD TWO THINGS. I WANTED TO THANK ALL OF THE WARD 1 RESIDENTS WHO HAVE BEEN EMAILING AND COUNCILLING COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER AND ME ON YOUR VARIOUS QUESTIONS AND ISSUES AND I JUST WANT TO PUT A REMINDER OUT THAT WE GET A FLOOD OF EMAILS AND IF AT ANY POINT YOU DO NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE FROM THE TEAM, PLEASE DON'T HESITATE TO NUDGE US, BECAUSE IT IS OUR INTENTION TO RESPOND TO EACH OF YOUR QUESTIONS AND GET THOSE RESOLVED. THE OTHER THING, THE SECOND THING I JUST WANT TO THANK COUNCILMEMBER KATHY GRISWOLD AND WARD 3 RESIDENT TONY BROWN FOR DOING THE TECHNOLOGY LAST NIGHT FOR CITY COUNCIL CAUCUS. WE PULLED IT OFF. IT WAS A GREAT MEETING. AND I WANT TO INVITE CITYWIDE ALL THE CITIZENS TO JOIN US AT OUR NEXT CAUCUS, WHICH WILL BE SUNDAY NIGHT APRIL 19th AT 7:00 ON ZOOM IF ALL GOES WELL. THANK YOU.
00:41:38.972: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND?
00:41:43.910: >> Councilmember Grand: SORRY ABOUT THAT. THANK YOU. I WANT JUST A FEW ACKNOWLEDGMENTS. ONE, I WANT TO MAYBE SPEAK FOR SOME OF THE PARENTS AND ACKNOWLEDGE ALL OF OUR TEACHERS IN THE ANN ARBOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS WHO ARE WORKING SO HARD TO TRY TO HELP OUR CHILDREN CONTINUE TO LEARN AND HAVE A SENSE OF COMMUNITY. ALSO TO, YOU KNOW, ANN ARBOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS FOR ALL THE FOOD AND TECHNOLOGY DISTRIBUTIONS THAT THEY HAVE DONE TO MAKE SURE THAT EQUITY IS AT THE CENTER OF THEIR EFFORTS. I REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THAT IS THE DIS STRICT IS DOING AND -- DISTRICTS IS DOING AND OUR TEACHERS ARE DOING. THANK YOU TO ALL OF YOU ARE CITY WORKERS WHO ARE HELPING PROVIDE ESSENTIAL SERVICES. TO OUR PARTNERS AT THE COUNTY WHO HAVE BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN RESPONDING TO CONCERNS ABOUT OUR MOST VULNERABLE RESIDENTS. I ALSO JUST WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE HAVE BEEN JUST SOME INCREDIBLE AND SIGNIFICANT CHARITABLE EFFORTS THAT HAVE COME OUT IN SUPPORT OF LOCAL BUSINESSES AND SUPPORT OF PEOPLE WHO BECOME UNEMPLOYED SO THAT WE AREN'T HAVING AS MANY RESIDENTS FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS AS MAYBE OTHERS IN OTHER COMMUNITIES ARE SEEING. WE HAVE ONE WOMAN IN THE THIRD WORLD, CAITLIN KLEIN AND THERE ARE MANY OTHERS HAPPENING AND I JUST WANTED TO ACKNOWLEDGE JUST THAT THERE'S BEEN INCREDIBLE GENEROSITY, WHICH WE ALL KNOW FROM LIVING HERE, BUT IT'S BEEN -- IT'S BEEN INCREDIBLE AND HUMBLING TO SEE THAT. SO I THINK THAT'S IT. AND AS MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID, YOU KNOW, WE ARE BOTH TRYING TO BE RESPONSIVE BUT ALSO STAY OUT OF THE WAY OF PEOPLE WHO NEED TO PROVIDE THESE ESSENTIAL SERVICES, KNOWING THAT IT'S THE COUNTY OR THE STATE THAT INTO ED TO STEP IN AND WE ARE VERY FORTUNATE TO HAVE INCREDIBLE PARTNERS AT BOTH OF THOSE LEVELS. AND ALSO, ONE MORE THIRD WARD RESIDENT THAT I HEARD FROM, WOULD IS SETTING UP THE LEADERSHIP TEAM FOR THE FIELD HOSPITAL, IT DEFINITELY DIDN'T HAPPEN BECAUSE ONE PERSON ASKED FOR IT. IT'S HAPPENING AND ALL OF THESE EFFORTS FROM HEALTHCARE WORKERS AS A RESULT, TRAINING AND PASSION AND DEDICATION AND A LOT OF HARD WORK AND PLANNING. SO -- AND IT REALLY DOES LOOK LIKE THESE EFFORTS AT SOCIAL AND PHYSICAL DISTANCING HAVE BEEN PAYING OFF IN OUR COMMUNITY. SO AS DIFFICULT AS IT IS, THANK YOU FOR ALL OF THOSE WHO ADVOCATED FOR THEM. DON'T BE AFRAID TO REACH OUT TO OUR FIRST -- FOR OUR FIRST RESPONDERS AT THE POLICE DEPARTMENT. THEY ARE NOT TICKETING PEOPLE. THEY ARE JUST PROVIDING EDUCATION. SO IF YOU SEE SOMETHING THAT IS OF CONCERN TO YOU, PLEASE DON'T HESITATE TO SPEAK OUT. THANKS SO MUCH.
00:44:43.456: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER COMMUNICATION FROM COUNCIL? I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF COMMUNICATIONS. FIRST, I WOULD LIKE TO TOUCH A LITTLE BIT UPON WHERE WE ARE, AND WHERE WE ARE GOING. AS WE ALL KNOW, GOVERNOR WHITMER ISSUED A STAY HOME, STAY SAFE ORDER, AN EXECUTIVE ORDER WHICH ORDERS MICHIGAN RESIDENTS TO STAY IN PLACE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF COVID-19, AND THAT THIS IS A LEGAL ORDER ENFORCEABLE BY LAW AND FORCE TO PROTECT PUBLIC GOOD. THIS MEANS THAT ALL RESIDENTS, THAT IS TO SAY, CHILDREN, SENIORS AND EVERYBODY IN BETWEEN IS SUPPOSED TO STAY AT HOME, UNLESS THEY ARE ENGAGED IN AN ESSENTIAL FUNCTION. BUSINESSES SUCH AS GROCERIES, PHARMACIES, MEDICAL CENTERS, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND THOSE THAT SUPPORT THEM WILL BE OPEN UNDER LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES. IF YOU ARE ABLE TO TRAVEL TO AND FROM THESE PLACES, YOU MAY, BUT OTHERWISE, PLEASE STAY AT HOME. STAY AT HOME AND STAY SAFE MEANS PLANNING AHEAD. DO NOT SHOP EVERY DAY IF YOU ARE -- MAKE YOUR LIST. GO ONCE A WEEK. DON'T HOARD. WE CAN GET THROUGH THIS CRISIS ONLY AS ACTING AS NEIGHBORS AND MEMBERS OF COMMUNITY. I CANNOT EMPHASIZE THIS POINT ENOUGH. THE GOVERNOR'S ORDER ENCOURAGES PEOPLE TO GO OUTSIDE BUT IF YOU DO SO, YOU MUST MAINTAIN SOCIAL DISTANCING AT ALL TIMES. NO PLAYGROUNDS. NO PLAY DATES. NO TEAM SPORTS. YOU GO OUT OUTSIDE BUT DO SO. YOUR ATTENTION TO DETAIL, IT WILL HELP A NURSE ON HER SHIFT OR A DOCTOR ON HIS SHIFT. SO PLEASE BE CAREFUL. WHILE STAY HOME AND STAY SAFE MEANS STAY HOME AND STAY SAFE, IT DOESN'T MEAN BE ISOLATED. IT IS THE OPPOSITE. WE HERE AT CITY COUNCIL AND EVERYWHERE UP AND DOWN THE LINE, WE WANT YOU TO CHECK IN ON YOUR PEOPLE. CALL YOUR FRIENDS. CALL YOUR FAMILY. DO IT OFTEN. TALK TO YOUR NEIGHBORS FROM A SAFE DISTANCE. LET THEM KNOW HOW THEY ARE DOING. TEXT YOUR COWORKERS. SPEND SOME TIME ON THE PHONE WITH YOUR FRIENDS, YOUR PARENTS, YOUR SIBLINGS. MAKE SURE EVERYBODY IS OKAY. ALSO -- AND I WOULD LIKE TO ECHO SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES' COMMENTS, I WOULD LIKE TO STOP FOR A MOMENT AND RECOGNIZE WHAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN DOING. THERE ARE FOLKS WHO NEVER EXPECTED TO BE ON THE FRONT LINES. GROCERY STORE CLERKS, PHARMACISTS, HEALTHCARE WORKERS, JANITORS, ALL OF THESE FOLKS AT THIS POINT ARE FULFILLING -- DELIVERY WORKERS, FULFILLING SOME OF THE MOST CRITICAL WORK IN OUR SOCIETY AND WE OWE THEM DEEP GRATITUDE AND RESPECT FOR WHAT THEY ARE DOING. THEY ARE THE HEROES OF THIS CRISIS. CITY HALL IS CLOSED, BUT ANN ARBOR IS VERY MUCH OPEN. OUR CITY EMPLOYEES HAVE THE COURAGE, CREATIVITY AND COMMITMENT TO SERVE OUR COMMUNITY IN THE WORST OF TIMES. AND THAT -- THAT TOO IS UP AND DOWN THE LINE, AND MR. CRAWFORD HAS TOUCHED UPON IT, AS HAVE OTHER MEMBERS OF COUNCIL. OUR FIRST RESPONDERS ARE THERE EVERY SINGLE DAY, DOING THE WORK THAT OCCASIONALLY IS HANDS ON IN ORDER TO KEEP -- KEEP THE PUBLIC SAFE. BUT THEY ARE NOT ALONE IN THE COURAGEOUS DEDICATED WORK BEING PERFORMED BY CITY STAFF. THE MANNER, SPEED AND EFFICACY OF WHICH THE STAFF HAS DECENTRALIZED CITY OPERATIONS TO KEEP STAFF AND THE PUBLIC SAFE WHILE AT THE SAME TIME MAINTAINING CITY SERVICES HAS BEEN NOTHING SHORT OF AMAZING. I AM CONSTANTLY IMPRESSED AND PROUD AT THE WORK THAT THEY -- YOU -- HAVE DONE. SO THANK YOU. THE PANDEMIC, IT CAME TO US UNEXPECTEDLY, BUT THAT'S NOT HOW IT WILL LEAVE US. WE KNOW HOW TO SLOW THE VIRUS. WE KNOW THAT THE ONLY WAY TO OVERCOME THIS IS TO COMMIT TO EX-OTHER AND TO KEEP OUR DISTANCE. WE ARE NOT VICTIMS. WE ARE NOT POWERLESS. WE ARE AGENTS IN OUR OWN RECOVERY. AND THE ONLY WAY TO DO IT IS TOGETHER. SO I URGE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO DO SO. I WOULD LIKE TO REQUEST THE FOLLOWING CONFIRMATION. AND APPOINTMENT THAT WAS PRESENTED AT THE MARCH 16 REGULAR SESSION MEETING, THAT IS TIMOTHY DURHAM TO THE HOUSING BOARD OF APPEALS. MAY I HAVE A MOTION, PLEASE? MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER NELSON. SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER RAM CR RAMLAWI? DISCUSSION OF THIS APPOINTMENT? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] ALL OPPOSED? THE MOTION IS APPROVED. MAY I HAVE A MOTION TO APPROVE THE CONSENT AGENDA.
00:49:27.707: >> MOVED BY RAMLAWI AND SECONDED BY ACKERMAN.
00:49:33.646: >> Mayor Taylor: DISCUSSION OF THE CONCEPT AGENDA? COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
00:49:37.483: >> Councilmember Lumm: I WOULD LIKE TO PULL OUT CA-22 FOR DISCUSSION LATER AND MAKE A BRIEF COMMENT NOW ON CA-8. CA-8 IS TO SET THE MAY 4th -- TO SET MAY 4th AS THE DATE FOR THE PUBLIC HEARING AND COUNCIL VOTE ON THE NIXON/TRAVER SIDEWALK GAP ASSESSMENT PROJECT. A SUFFICIENT OF IMPACTED NUMBER OF PROPERTY OWNERS HAVE OBJECTED AND SO APPROVAL OF THIS ASSESSMENT PROJECT WILL REQUIRE 8 VOTES OF COUNCIL. I MENTIONED THIS FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS. FIRST TO ALERT THE SECOND WARD NEBUCHADNEZNEIGHBORS THAT THE HY BE MAY 4th. SECOND, TO LET NEIGHBORS KNOW THAT INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROJECT AND RESPONSES TO THE CONCERNS RAISED IN THE FORMAL OBJECTION LETTER HAS BEEN POSTED OPEN THE PROJECT WEB PAGE ON THE CITY'S WEBSITE. FINALLY, I BRING THIS UP TO RAISE A GENERAL CONCERN ABOUT CONDUCTING PUBLIC HEARINGS, PARTICULARLY ON ASSESSMENT PROJECTS DIRECTLY COSTING FOLKS MONEY REMOTELY AND ELECTRONICALLY. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE RIGHT ANSWER IS HERE AND I UNDERSTAND THE INTENT WAS TO COMPLETE THE PROJECTS THIS CONSTRUCTION SEASON, BUT IT DOESN'T FEEL QUITE RIGHT TO ME TO MAKE DECISIONS THAT COST INDIVIDUALS REAL MONEY WHEN THE NORMAL PROCESSES FOR PUBLIC HEARS ARE COMPROMISED AS THEY ARE NOW. THANK YOU.
00:50:58.130: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER EATON AND THEN NELSON IN THE QUEUE. COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
00:51:03.169: >> Councilmember Eaton: I WOULD LIKE TO PULL CA-18, PLEASE.
00:51:09.242: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER NELSON, WAS I CORRECT?
00:51:11.577: >> Councilmember Nelson:  YES, ACTUALLY, JANE PULLED THE SAME THING I WAS GOING TO PULL. SO I'M DONE.
00:51:16.482: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
00:51:20.987: >> Coun.YOU ARE ON MUTE COUNCIL.
00:51:26.525: >> Councilmember Bannister: CA-8 AND CA-9, PLEASE.
00:51:32.832: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
00:51:34.033: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: CA-26. I THINK THAT'S THE RIGHT NUMBER.
00:51:41.974: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE CONSENT AGENDA? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
00:51:45.144: >> Councilmember Hayner: YEAH, THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I THOUGHT I WAS PRESSING THE RAISE MY HAND, BUT IT WASN'T. I WOULD LIKE TO PULL CA-25 AND SPEAK EVER SO BRIEFLY TO 26. AND IF COUNCILMAN RAM LAWY IS GOING TO PULL THAT, I WILL WAIT FOR THAT -- RAMLAWI IS GOING TO PULL THAT, I WILL WAIT FOR THAT OPPORTUNITY.
00:52:10.603: >> Mayor Taylor: VERY GOOD. FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE CONSENT AGENDA. ALL IN FAVOR OF THE CONSENT AGENDA WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CA-8, 9, 18, 22, 25 AND 26? ALL IN IF A FAVOR PLEASE SAY AYE. [CHORUS OF AYES] ALL OPPOSED? THE CONSENT AGENDA WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CA-8, 9, 18, 22, 25, AND 26. IS APPROVED WITH 11 COUNCILMEMBERS PRESENT, ALL VOTING UNANIMOUSLY, THUS SATISFYING THE EIGHT VOTE REQUIREMENT WITH RESPECT TO CA LIVE 3, CA-4, CA-6, CA-12, CA-13, CA-14, CA-15, CA-19, CA-24. THAT IS ALL.
00:53:03.389: >> Counc
00:53:07.126: >> MAYOR, JUST A NOTE THAT CA-5 IS ON INJURE AGENDA AS STRICKEN.
00:53:11.931: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. MY APOLOGIES. I ACKNOWLEDGE AND AFFIRM THAT CA-5 WAS STRICKEN AND NOT APPROVED IN THE PRIOR VOTE. DRANK YOU.
00:53:27.012: >> Mayor Taylor: CA-22, RESOLUTION TO REALLOCATE $100,500 FROM RESIDENT-DRIVEN SIDEWALK GAP FILLING PROGRAM TO BARTON DRIVE IMPROVEMENT PROJECT AND THE JACKSON AVENUE SIDEWALK GAP PROJECT. MOVED BY LUMM AND SECONDED BY GRAND. DISCUSSION OF CA-22, COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
00:53:43.829: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I PULLED OUT CA-22, BECAUSE THIS EVENT IS HEAVY WITH SIDEWALK GAP GAP RESOLUTION AND CA-22 IS TO REALLOCATE FROM RESIDENT DRIVEN AND SIDEWALK GAP PROGRAM THE COUNCIL ESTABLISHED IN NOVEMBER IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE PROPERTY ASSESSMENTS IN TWO OF THE PROJECTS, BARTON DRIVE AND JACKSON AVENUE. THE DETAILS OF THE RESIDENT DRIVEN SIDEWALK GAP PROGRAM HAVEN'T BEEN FINALIZED BY STAFF, BUT GOING BACK TO NOVEMBER, MY UNDERSTANDING WAS THAT THE PROGRAM'S PURPOSE WAS TO PROVIDE A BIT OF FUNDING TO HELP FACILITATE SIDEWALK GAP PROJECTS THE NEIGHBORS REALLY WANTED BUT OTHERWISE MIGHT NOT OTHERWISE GET DONE THAT. WAS IN MY VIEW A REASONABLE OBJECTIVE AND WORTH TRYING. C.A.-22 ISN'T THAT, THOUGH. IT IS NOT HELPING BOTTOM UP RESIDENT PROVEN PROJECTS GET DONE. IT'S JUST TAKING $100,000 OF THAT $150,000 COUNCIL APPROVED FOR THE PROGRAM AND UTILIZING THE MONEY TO REDUCE THE ASSESSMENTS ON TWO PROJECTS BY HALF BECAUSE THOSE PROJECTS DID NOT BENEFIT FROM RECEIVING A FEDERAL GRANT. STAFF'S THINKING, IS THAT THESE TWO WERE SELECTED BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE FEDERAL GRANTS. THAT'S NOT UNREASONABLE, BUT I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF RESERVATIONS ABOUT DOING THAT. FIRST, IT WILL CARRY OVER TO NEXT YEAR IF IT'S NOT USED HERE. SO IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S LOST, AND FRANKLY, THAT SHOULDN'T BE THE REASON THAT WE MAKE SPENDING DECISIONS ANYWAY. MORE IMPORTANTLY, THOUGH, I'M CONCERNED THAT ONCE YOU BEGIN TO PICK WINNERS AND LOSERS ON WHICH ASSESSMENTS GET CUT AND WHICH ONES DON'T, YOU HEAD DOWN A SLIPPERY SLOPE. WHY THESE AND WHY NOT OTHERS? IT'S A BIG DEAL WHEN WE COLLECTIVE LIVE CHANGE THE CITY POLICY AND PRACTICE AND I FEAR WE OPEN A PANDORA'S BOX WHEN WE DO THAT. IF WE ARE GOING TO REVISIT THE REQUEST HE OF HOW NEW SIDEWALKS ARE PAID FOR, I BELIEVE THAT NEEDS TO BE DEBATED AND DONE FORMALLY, THOUGHTFULLY AND PUBLICLY, RATHER THAN THROUGH ONE OFFS LIKE THIS. ANYWAY, IT'S NOT A HUGE DEAL IF CA-22 PASSES AND I'M INTERESTED IN HEARING ITIF ANY OF MY COLLES SHARE THESE SAME FEELINGS.
00:56:04.336: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI AND NELSON.
00:56:07.473: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT ON CA-42.
00:56:12.578: >> Mayor Taylor: 22.
00:56:13.045: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: WHETHER WE HEAR ANY COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE ADMINISTRATOR, ABOUT THE RESPONSE TO RESOLUTION 19314 TO DERISK OUR PENSION SYSTEM, WHETHER THERE COULD BE -- THEY COULD GIVE US AN EXECUTIVE SUMMARY PERHAPS ON THAT, IF IT'S NOT OUT OF ORDER AT SOME POINT. I GUESS IT IS ALREADY OUT OF ORDER, BUT -- I WOULD LIKE TO GET AN EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ON THAT, IF IT'S POSSIBLE, BUT I GUESS IT'S NOT. ON CA-22, I SHARE MY COLLEAGUES' FRUSTRATIONS WITH HOW WE PICK AND CHOOSE AND FUND SIDEWALK ASSESSMENTS. IT'S PROBLEMATIC. IT OFTEN LEADS TO PROJECTS NOT BEING APPROVED BECAUSE OF THE FRICTION IT CAUSES, WHEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING THAT'S FOR THE GREATER GOOD, BUT BEING ASSESSED BY HOW MUCH SQUARE FOOTAGE YOU HAVE IN FRONT OF YOUR HOUSE. SO THAT IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE A PROBLEM, AND ONE THAT HOPEFULLY WILL BE ADDRESSED IN THE COMING MONTHS OR YEARS BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THE HISTORIC WAYS OF ASSESSING ARE DOING US ANY FAVORS AS WE MOVE FORWARD. I THINK IT'S AFFORDABILITY IS ALWAYS AN ISSUE HERE IN ANN ARBOR. WE TALK ABOUT AFFORDABILITY. AND THIS IS A HUGE COMPONENT OF AFFORDABILITY WHEN YOU START ASSESSING HIGH ASSESSMENTS FOR FOLKS THAT ARE ON FIXED INCOMES. THEY ARE EFFECTIVELY PUSHED OUT OF THE COMMUNITY AT TIMES INADVERTENTLY. THESE ARE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES BUT THESE ARE CONSEQUENCES. THESE ARE REAL CONSEQUENCES AND AS WE SEE SOMETIMES THESE ASSESSMENTS ARE VERY LARGE. AND, YOU KNOW, I APPRECIATE THE LOW INTEREST LOANS THAT GIVES OVER FAVORABLE TIME FRAMES, BUT YOU STILL HAVE TO PAY THE MONEY. AND FOR PEOPLE ON FIXED INCOMES, IT'S VERY DIFFICULT, AS WE ARE -- WE ARE OFTEN HERE. AND I JUST WANT TO FIND A WAY WHERE WE CAN ADDRESS OUR PUBLIC NEEDS WITHOUT CAUSING SO MUCH CONFLICT AND FRICTION WHEN IT COMES TO FINANCING THE PORTION THAT IS PAID FOR BY THE RESIDENTS. SO IN THIS CASE, YOU KNOW, WOULD HAVE DETECTIVE LUMM OUT, AND SHE SNIFFS EVERYTHING. WE HAVE A PROGRAM DESIGNED FOR SOMETHING SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT IT'S BEING APPLIED FOR HERE. I DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE A HUGE PROBLEM TO GO AS FAR TO SAY NO ON THIS, BUT IT IS IT IS BENDING THE RULES, BENDING SOME OF THE INTENT THAT WE HAD ON THAT ORIGINAL FUNDING PROGRAM, AND PERHAPS COUNCILMEMBER NELSON CAN FILL US IN A LITTLE BIT MORE, PERHAPS. SHE'S THE ONE WHO BROUGHT THAT TO US AND SHE KNOWS THE TRUE INTENTION AND THE MOTIVE BEHIND IT, AND WHETHER THIS IS ACTUALLY FULFILLING IT WITH THIS RESOLUTION. I APPRECIATE THE TIME.
00:59:24.903: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER NELSON AND THEN SMITH IN THE QUEUE. COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
00:59:28.107: >> Councilmember Nelson: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I WAS JUST GOING TO COMMENT THAT I REALLY AGREE WITH A LOT OF WHAT COUNCILMEMBER LUMM ARTICULATED ABOUT THE PROBLEM WITH THIS. I DID SIT DOWN WITH STAFF AND HAVE A LOT OF CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT I IMAGINED OF THIS PILOT PROGRAM, AND THIS IS KIND OF THE OPPOSITE. THE -- THE IDEA THAT RESIDENTS WOULD BRING FORWARD A PROJECT THAT RESIDENTS WOULD BE DRAWING OUR ATTENTION TO A PROJECT, THAT WASN'T OTHERWISE UNDER THE -- OTHERWISE GETTING PRIORITIZATION BECAUSE IT WASN'T ATTENTIONED TO SOMETHING ELSE, I -- ON THE ONE HAND, THE PROGRAM AS CONCEIVED WAS ALWAYS GOING TO FILTER THROUGH STAFF. STAFF WAS ALWAYS GOING TO BE PICKING AND CHOOSING WHICH ONES WERE GOING TO MOVE FORWARD, BUT THIS -- THIS REALLY -- I -- IT BOTHERS ME A LOT, THE IDEA OF -- WELL, THIS LOOKS LIKE THEY ARE PAYING A LOT OF MONEY AND LET'S GIVE THEM A BREAK. IT FEELSVERY ARBITRARY AND THAT WAS -- THAT WAS NOT AT ALL WHAT I INTENDED. THE IDEA WAS THAT A PROGRAM WOULD HAVE A PROCESS AND PROCEDURE AND THERE WOULD BE STANDARDS AND IT WAS SORT OF GIVING DIRECTION TO STAFF TO CREATE THOSE STANDARDS AND WE DON'T HAVE THOSE STANDARDS YET. AND SO IT'S TROUBLING TO ME THAT THE MONEY WOULD BE REJECTED IN THIS WAY. AND THE OTHER THING THAT I WOULD ADD IS WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT THIS PROGRAM, THE ORIGINAL AMOUNT OF MONEY SET ASIDE FOR IT WAS RELATIVELY SMALL AND STAFF -- STAFF TOLD ME, YOU KNOW THIS IS NOT REALLY GOING TO BUILD A LOT OF SIDEWALKS ANYWAY, BUT, YOU KNOW, WE WERE TRYING IT AND SO TO HAVE THIS MONEY ROLL OVER INTO NEXT YEAR, IT MEANS THAT PERHAPS WE COULD BUILD MORE SIDEWALKS WITH THE GOAL OF -- OF BUILDING SIDEWALKS WHERE RESIDENTS ARE REALLY CLAMORING FOR THEM. I CAN'T SUPPORT CA-22. IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO REJECT THOSE MONIES IN THAT WAY. I'M NOT SURE THAT IT'S APPROPRIATE TO -- TO -- TO DIRECT ANY FUNDS ARBITRARILY IN THIS WAY TO JUST SAY, WELL, THESE RESIDENTS SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY THAT MUCH FOR THOSE SIDEWALKS. I MEAN, IT JUST -- IT FEELS VERY RANDOM TO ME.
01:01:51.917: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. COUNCILMEMBER SMITH, YOU WERE EARLIER, ARE YOU STILL IN THE QUEUE?
01:01:56.855: >> Councilmember Smith: I AM. SO THIS IS A CONVERSATION I HAD WITH VARIOUS STAFF MEMBERS TO TRY ANEROID WHAT WOULD BE THE COST FOR THE CITY TO TAKE CARE OF ALL THE SIDEWALK GAPS IN THE CITY AND IF YOU LOOKED AT ALL THE -- ALL THE GAPS THROUGHOUT THE CITY, IT'S A RANGE FROM 155 TO $230 MILLION, BUT AS YOU GO THROUGH A PROCESS OF ELIMINATING AREAS, YO YOU KNOW, ALONG GRAVEL ROADS THAT ARE NOT LIKELY TO BE PAVED, FOR INSTANCE, IT GETS DOWN TO AN ESTIMATE OF ABOUT 89 MILES OF SIDEWALK GAPS. THE ESTIMATED COST BETWEEN 94 AND 141 MILLION. I THINK WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN THE LAST, YOU KNOW, FIVE YEARS OR SO, THAT THESE ASSESSMENTS ARE -- HIT CERTAIN PEOPLE REALLY HARD. AND I UNDERSTAND THAT AND I'M EMPATHIC TO THAT. I THINK WE NEED TO CONSIDER BUILDING THIS INTO OUR ROAD AND SIDEWALK MILLAGE RENEWAL, TO TRY AND TACKLE THIS IN AN INCREMENTAL BASIS GOING FORWARD. ULTIMATELY, YOU KNOW, IT'S -- WE'RE IN AN AGE RIGHT NOW WHERE ALL. INADEQUACIES OF THE WAY WE GOVERN THINGS IN MICHIGAN ARE LAID PRETTY BEAR AND THE FACT THAT WE AS A MUNICIPALITY ARE NOT REALLY THE ONES GOING AND BUILDING THIS AND THEN IT'S INCLUDED IN A TAX BILL. YOU KNOW, THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN A LOT OF PLACES. SO, YOU KNOW, I THINK WE NEED TO START THINKING ABOUT HOW DO WE CHANGE HOW WE FUND THIS STUFF? AND UNTIL WE DO THAT, WE WILL HAVE THIS DISCUSSION EVERY SINGLE TIME WE TRY TO FILL A SIDEWALK GAP. I GUARANTEE YOU, IF SOMEONE HAS 100 FEET OF FRONTAGE, THEY WILL NEVER EVER, WANT TO PAY TO PUT A SIDEWALK IN HERE.
01:03:54.773: >> Mayor Taylor: GRISWOLD, BANNISTER AND ACKERMAN. THEN PERHAPS WE CAN CALL IT A DAY.
01:03:58.910: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WANT TO AGREE WITH EVERYTHING THAT COUNCILMEMBER SMITH SAID, EXCEPT THERE ARE A FEW PEOPLE WOULD WANT SIDEWALKS IN ANY NEIGHBORHOOD WHO DON'T HAVE THEM, BUT THEY ARE DEFINITELY THE EXCEPTION. I THINK THAT THIS RESOLUTION WAS REALLY STAFF'S ATTEMPT TO -- TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR SOME RESIDENTS. AND SO I DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE STAFF'S EFFORT IN BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND THE LAST THING I WANT TO SAY IS WE DO HAVE A FUNDING PROBLEM, BUT WITHOUT HAVING VISION ZERO ENGINEERING G EXPERTISE, WE SEEM TO ALWAYS BE ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES PIECEMEAL RATHER THAN HAVING SOMEONE WHO COULD WORK TO IDENTIFY PRIORITIES IN THIS AREA, BASED OPEN PEDESTRIAN CYCLING AND VEHICLE CRASH DATA. THANK YOU.
01:04:59.371: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
01:05:00.739: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES, HI. I DO APPRECIATE ALL YOUR GUYS' KIND WORDS ABOUT THE BURDEN PLACED ON THE HOMEOWNER, WHEN THEY ARE PAID TO PAY FOR THE SIDEWALK AND I REALLY DO WANT TO WORK WITH ALL OF YOU ON IT, BECAUSE IT IS A CRISIS, PARTICULARLY ON A COUPLE OF HOMEOWNERS ON BARTON DRIVE. ONE OF THE HOMEOWNERS AT 415 BARTON, WITH THE 50% REDUCTION FROM THIS RESOLUTION, WITH THAT INCLUDED, MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THEIR PERSONAL BILL IS STILL $18,738. SO I HAVE TO VOTE YES ON DIVERTING THIS MONEY AND IT'S A RAREALLY TOUGH CHOICE AND I KNOW I'M NOT ON THE PREVAILING SIDES, IT SOUNDS LIKE, BUT I HAVE JUST SPOKEN -- THESE ARE SENIOR PEOPLE, SENIOR MEMBERS. THEY ARE ON THE FIXED INCOME, AND I -- I JUST -- WHO ARE WE TO TAKE MONEY FROM THE POCKETS OF THESE SENIOR PEOPLE TO THE TUNE OF 18,738 OR $40,000. PLUS, AS WE CAN TALK ABOUT AS WE GET TO THIS BARTON DRIVE PROPOSAL, STAFFER -- BECAUSE OF THEIR YARDS, STAFF IS SAYING, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE THIS ENORMOUS SWITCHBACK, WHICH YOU CAN SEE ONLINE. WE HAVE ALREADY DONE IT OVER AT OXFORD. THE COST THAT I AM BALLPARKING TO REMOVE SNOW AND ICE WILL BE $1,000 A YEAR ON TOP OF -- SO I AM VERY SERIOUS ABOUT THE COURT OF PUBLIC HEARING ON MAY 4, THAT I -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO OTHER THAN ASK FOR ALL OF YOUR HELP AND STAFF'S HELP TO PAY, AND WHETHER WE CAN FIND MONEY IN THE BUDGET SOMEWHERE. WE HAVE 150,000 MILES OF SIDEWALK GAPS AND I THINK EVERY RESIDENT CITYWIDE, WHO DOESN'T HAVE A SIDEWALK REALLY CARES ABOUT OUR DECISION MAKING ON THIS. THANK YOU.
01:07:28.253: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
01:07:32.591: >> CouncCOUNCILMEMBER, YOU ARE .
01:07:39.130: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU. I'M HAVING A LITTLE DELAY, BECAUSE OF MY POOR INTERNET HERE. IT -- THIS IS NOT -- THIS IS NOT THE INTENT OF COUNCILWOMAN NELSON'S RESOLUTION, AND I'M HAVING A HARD TIME SAYING THAT BECAUSE AS MY COUNCIL COLLEAGUE IN WARD 1 SAYS, THIS IS A REAL HIT FOR THESE PEOPLE ON BARTON, AND A BUNCH OF THEM ARE SENIORS ON FIXED INCOME. COUNCILMAN SMITH, I AGREE, WE NEED TO COME UP WITH A BETTER WAY TO DO THIS, EVERYBODY THINKS THAT AND WE NEED TO DO IT SOON BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE THAT SIDEWALKS ARE A -- THEY ARE PUBLIC GOOD, AND YET WE PAY FOR THEM PRIVATELY. AND THAT SHOULDN'T BE HAPPENING, ESPECIALLY WHEN WE ARE DOING CURB AND GUTTER WORK NEXT TO WHERE THE SIDEWALK IS GOING TO BE AS PART OF A GIANT RESEARCH PROJECT. WE SHOULD BE BUILT INTO THESE RESERVICING PROJECTS AND COUNCILMEMBER NELSON AND REALLY THE BODIES ATTEMPT AT GETTING A BOTTOM UP WAY TO PAY FOR THE SIDEWALKS AND DISCOUNT IT, AND WE CAN PRIORITIZE THAT. IT IS FULLY APPROPRIATE AND I THINK IT SHOULD BE LEFT FOR THESE SMALLER PROJECTS. I'M GOING TO -- I'M GOING TO VOTE AGAINST THIS, BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO GUT THAT INTENTION, BUT I WOULD LIKE SOME FOLKS ON COUNCIL ON HOW WE CAN WRITE THIS IN AND HOW DO WE NEED OUR ROAD MILLAGE AND UP THE TINY PERCENT OF THE SIDEWALK MILLAGE THAT'S ROLLED IN WITH THE STREETS AND THE SIDEWALKS MILLAGE? WE NEED TO HAVE A BETTER WAY TO SHARE THE BURDEN. RIGHT NOW, THE SOCIAL BURDEN OF OWNING A SIDEWALK IS ACCEPTED BY FOLKS. THEY UNDERSTAND THAT THEY HAVE TO DO THEIR PART FOR SOCIETY AND KEEP THEM CLEAN. BUT NOT PAYING FOR IT. THAT'S NOT SOCIALIZING THE COST. THAT'S -- THAT'S INDIVIDUALIZING THE COST, AND I DON'T THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE ANYMORE THAN YOU GUYS.
01:09:30.909: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
01:09:37.449: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. IT TAKES A MINUTE TO UNMUTE. BUT, YOU KNOW, I'M JUST GOING TO URGE MANY I COLLEAGUES TO SUPPORT THIS TONIGHT. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT, EVEN THOUGH IT'S FAR FROM PERFECT, AND IT MISSES THE INTENT OF THE PROGRAM, BUT I FEEL THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO PROVIDE SOME HELP AND RELIEF AND BENEFIT TO OUR COMMUNITY. SO I JUST WANTED TO CHIME IN HERE AND URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO VOTE YET ON THIS IF POSSIBLE. THANK YOU.
01:10:05.377: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN, I THINK I MISSED YOU IN THE QUEUE.
01:10:10.515: >> Councilmember Ackerman: NO, YOU ARE OKAY. COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER SAID MOST OF WHAT I WANTED TO SAY. I WAS VERY SUPPORTIVE OF COUNCILMEMBER NELSON'S ORIGINAL RESOLUTION. I THINK IT'S A FANTASTIC IDEA. I DO APPRECIATE THAT STAFF SAW A NEED TO PUT IN A SIDEWALK AND SAW ECONOMIC BURDEN PUT ON RESIDENTS AND WANTED TO TRY TO SOLVE TWO PROBLEMS. I HOPE THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD, THE PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTING COUNCIL'S POLICY WILL SMOOTHEN AND BECOME MORE ESTABLISHED. BUT RIGHT NOW, THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO PUT SIDEWALK IN FRONT OF OLDER RESIDENTS' HOMES, OLDER RESIDENTS WHO ARE ON A FIXED INCOME AND I WANT TO TAKE THAT OPPORTUNITY. THANKS.
01:10:51.623: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING WITH ME.
01:11:00.465: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
01:11:01.733: >> Councilmember Eaton: NO.
01:11:02.333: >> Councilmember Nelson:  NO.
01:11:07.238: >> Councilmember Smith: YES.
01:11:07.839: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES.
01:11:13.878: >> Councilmember Hayner:  NO.
01:11:14.479: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES.
01:11:16.748: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES.
01:11:23.621: >> Councilmember Lumm: NO.
01:11:24.189: >> Councilmember Grand: YES.
01:11:24.989: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES.
01:11:27.091: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION FAILS.
01:11:32.597: >> Mayor Taylor: CA-18, RESOLUTION TO APPROVE ADMINISTRATIVE CONSENT ORDER FOR SANITARY SEWER OVERFLOWS WITH THE MICHIGAN DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENT, GREAT LAKES AND ENERGY. $45,000. MOVED BY EATON AND SECONDED BY ACKERMAN. DISCUSSION OF CA-18, COUNCILMEMBER EATON?
01:11:47.846: >> Councilmember Eaton: THANK YOU. I PULLED THIS ITEM FROM THE AGENDA BECAUSE I WANT TO ADRAW ATTENTION TO IT. SO OFTEN, WE ARE TOLD THAT THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR NEEDS TO BE MORE THAN JUST A CITY THAT DOES THE BASICS. THIS ORDER CONFIRMS THAT WE'RE NOT DOING BASICS. WE ARE FAILING ON A BASIC RESPONSIBILITY, MAINTAINING OUR SEWERS. I SUPPORT THIS. BUT I THINK IT'S ESSENTIAL TO STRESS THAT REPEATEDLY OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS WE HAVE DUMPED THOUSANDS OF GALLONS OF RAW SEWAGE INTO THE RIVER. WE NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO OUR FUNDAMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY TO MAINTAIN OUR INFRASTRUCTURE. THIS ORDER LISTS THE MANY TIMES THAT WE HAVE HAD SEWER OVERFLOWS, AND ALSO IT LISTS THE MANY LAWS AND REGULATIONS OF THE STATE OF MICHIGAN THAT WE VIOLATED. AS AN ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDS, I BELIEVE WE NEED TO BETTER DO BETTER THAN WE HAVE DONE IN THE PAST. I THINK THAT THIS CONSENT ORDER ACTUALLY MOVES US IN THAT DIRECTION AND THE FINE IS RATHER SMALL. AND WE SHOULD BE HAPPY FOR THAT. BUT WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY HERE TO TAKE CARE OF OUR CITY, AND THE IMPACT IT HAS ON THE RIVER AND OUR ENVIRONMENT IN GENERAL. SO I HOPE YOU WILL SUPPORT THIS.
01:13:17.769: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD?
01:13:24.776: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES. I HAVE ONE QUESTION. GIVEN THAT IT'S A $45,000 FINE, DOES IT REQUIRE EIGHT VOTES OR ARE WE GOING TO APPROVE THE FINE AT A LATER DATE?
01:13:41.159: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. CRAWFORD?
01:13:42.060: >> City Admin. Crawford: I'M GOING TO ASK MR. HUPY TO RESPOND. I BELIEVE IT'S CONTAINED WITHIN THE EXISTING BUDGET, ACTUALLY. MR. HUPY, I THINK YOU ARE MUTED STILL. COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD, I BELIEVE THIS RELATIVELY SMALL AMOUNT IS AFFORDABLE WITHIN THE EXISTING FUNDS.
01:14:11.823: >> THERE I AM OFF MUTE FINALLY.
01:14:14.092: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
01:14:15.126: >> IT IS WITHIN THE EXISTING FUNDS. AND THE WORK THAT THE A.C.L. REQUIRES US TO DO. WE HAD STARTED MUCH OF THAT IN RECOGNITION OF THE UPGRADES THAT WE NEED TO MAKE TO THE SEWER SYSTEM AND ITS MAINTENANCE. SO THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OUTSIDE OF THE PROPOSED BUDGET IS MINIMAL.
01:14:44.989: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD, YOU STILL HAVE THE FLOOR. THCAUGHT>> Councilmember Griswo THANK YOU.
01:14:59.003: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
01:15:00.104: >> Councilmember Bannister: OVER THE MONTHS AND AS MLIVE WROTE ABOUT THE SEWER OVERFLOWS AND WE HAD DIFFERENT CASES WRITTEN BEFORE THE INSURANCE BOARD AND ALL OF THAT, THERE HAS BEEN A CALL FOR PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE DASHBOARD ONLINE, ON THE WEBSITE SOMEWHERE, THAT WOULD SAY THE DATE, THE LOCATION, THE VOLUME DISCHARGED AND THE REASON FOR THE DISCHARGE. AND WE HADN'T GOTTEN THERE YET, BUT I WOULD NOTE THAT IN THIS RESOLUTION, IN THE ATTACHED LETTER FROM GRETCHEN WHITMER AND EGLE, THEY HAVE ITEMIZED FOR US IN THIS FINE, SOME OF THE SEWER OVERFLOWS AND SO MY QUESTION FOR STAFF IS, WOULD THIS HELP US JUMP START SOME OF THE DASHBOARDS SO THAT WE CAN KEEP BETTER TRANSPARENCY AND ACTABILITY? ACCOUNTABILITY BECAUSE WE ALL WIN WHEN RESIDENTS CAN HELP US WITH OUR DECISION MAKING.
01:16:11.909: >> THE DASHBOARDS ARE ALREADY ENVISIONED AND WE ARE WORKING ON THEM. SO THEY WILL BE COMING IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE.
01:16:22.019: >> Councilmember Bannister: INCLUDING THE TYPE OF DATA THAT'S INCLUDED IN THE EGLE LETTER?
01:16:29.260: >> YES.
01:16:29.894: >> Councilmember Bannister: AND DO YOU HAVE IT ESTIMATED? IS IT THIS YEAR OR --
01:16:36.334: >> I AM GOING TO LOOK AT JENNIFER LAWSON TO COMMENT ON THE TIMING.
01:16:43.074: >> WE HAVE ALREADY BEEN LOOKING AT SEVERAL OTHER MUNICIPALITIES TO SEE WHAT OTHER MINUTE PA WILLITIES REPORT OUT FOR THAT SPECIFIC DATA. WE ALREADY HAD A DRAFT THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE PRESENTING TO OUR COMMUNICATIONS GROUP, HOPEFULLY WITHIN THE NEXT WEEK. I WOULD ANTICIPATE IN ABOUT A MONTH, MAYBE WE WOULD HAVE THAT FIRST LEVEL OF A DASHBOARD AVAILABLE, AND CONTINUALLY KEEPING IT UPDATED.
01:17:09.467: >> Councilmember Bannister:  I THINK THAT WOULD BE A GREAT IDEA. THANK YOU.
01:17:13.638: >> Mayor Taylor: I THINK COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, YOU RAISED YOUR HAND, A AM I CORRECT?
01:17:20.344: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES, ON CA-22, I SEE ON OUR -- THE AGENDA IT, ADVERTISE THAT IT HAD AN EIGHT VOTE REQUIREMENT -- I ASSUME THAT'S BECAUSE IT WAS A REALLOCATION, BUT WEREN'T THOSE FUNDS ALREADY INCUMBERED FOR SIDEWALK GAP PROJECTS. WHY WOULD IT REQUIRE EIGHT TO REALLOCATE, THE PURPOSE OF THOSE FUNDS? I WAS STARTLED WHEN JACKIE SAID IT FAILED AND I WENT AND LOOKED AT MY AGENDA, WHICH I GOT UP ON THE SCREEN. I MISS OUR PRINTED AGENDAS, BUT IT SAYS EIGHT VOTES AND I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT. I'M SORRY I DIDN'T ASK THAT QUESTION PRIOR TO THIS, BUT -- WHY IS THAT? WHY AREN'T THOSE FUNDS -- WHY WEREN'T THOSE FUNDS ALREADY INCUMBERED FOR SIDEWALK GAP?
01:18:12.663: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. POSTEMA AND MR. CRAWFORD, DO YOU WANT TO TAKE CARE OF THIS QUESTION SO WE CAN MOVE BACK TO THIS MATTER?
01:18:20.171: >> City Admin. Crawford: I BELIEVE THIS IS TAKING THE PROJECT EXPENDITURES OFF. WHILE YOU APPROPRIATED THE EXPENDITURE FROM THE GENERAL FUND, THIS IS -- YOU WOULD NEED TO TAKE THE PROJECT EXPENDITURES OFF AND THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE THE EIGHT VOTES. I WILL FOLLOW UP WITH YOU AFTER.
01:18:35.686: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WANTED TO GET THAT AFTER. I DIDN'T SUPPORT IT. THANK YOU.
01:18:44.128: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? I WILL BE VOTING IN FAVOR OF THIS -- OF THIS MATTER, BUT I WOULD LIKE TO STATE THAT THE SUGGESTION -- IT'S NOT EVEN A SUGGESTION OR A STATEMENT THAT WE HAVEN'T BEEN PAYING ATTENTION TO THE BASICS -- THAT WE HAVE NOT BEEN PAYING ATTENTION TO THE BASICS IS AN UNFOUNDED INSULT TO THE GREAT WORK THAT STAFF DOES UP AND DOWN THE LINE. THE REASONS REASONS FOR THE DISS THAT ARE REFERENCED HERE INCLUDE SANITARY SEWER BLOCKED WITH FLUSHABLE WIPES TO 150,000 GALLONS. OBVIOUSLY, NOT A STAFF ISSUE. CONTRACT FOR LEAVING 300 FEET OF ROPE. NOT A STAFF ISSUE. TREE ROOTS, F TREE ROOTS AND AN OVERFLOW, THOSE LAST THREE MATTERS IN THE AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY 7500 GALLONS. SO THE PLAIN AND VAST MAJORITY OF THE DISCHARGES HERE ARE THE RESULT OF CONTRACTOR ERROR AND RESIDENT ERROR. STAFF FOCUSES ON THESE MATTERS CONSISTENTLY, WITH DILIGENCE AND FORESIGHT AND I'M GRATEFUL FOR THEIR WORK. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
01:20:05.676: >> Councilmember Lumm: THERE'S A BIT OF A GRAY AREA HERE, AND IT'S NOT BLACK AND WHITE. I HAVE SEEN THE EVIDENCE OF THIS AND COUNCILMEMBER NELSON, WHO SERVES WITH ME ON THE BOARD OF INSURANCE, WE SEE THESE SANITARY SEWER BACKUPS, YOU KNOW, STORM STORMWATER RELATED, SEWER RELATED, AND ALL OF THE ABOVE AT OUR BOARD OF INSURANCE. WHAT WE USUALLY DO WHEN WE ARE TRYING TO TRACK THE CAUSE, WE ALSO ASK QUESTIONS IF IT'S IN A MAINTENANCE DISTRICT. THERE ARE SO MANY OVERFLOWS BY TREE ROOTS AND FLUSHABLE WIPES AND ALL SORTS OF THINGS. THE REALITY IS THAT WE -- NOT ALL SECTIONS -- THE ENTIRE CITY IS NOT IN ATE MAINTENANCE DISTRICT WHERE WE GO OUT AND PERIODICALLY, YOU KNOW, TV AND, YOU KNOW, EXAMINE THE INFRASTRUCTURE. SO IT'S JUST SOMETHING WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DO. AND I DO THINK THAT PUBLIC WORKS DOES A GREAT JOB. BUT THEY -- YOU KNOW, THEY ARE LIMITED AND SO WE GET THESE SURPRISES WHICH ARE UNFORTUNATE, OBVIOUSLY, WHEN THEY ALSO AFFECT THE PROPERTY OWNERS BUT WE ARE SIMPLY UNABLE, AT THIS POINT IN TIME, TO PROACTIVELY TV AND -- AND MONITOR THE MAINTENANCE THROUGHOUT THE CITY. THANK BE YOU.
01:21:55.052: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD?
01:21:56.954: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES. SOMEONE HAS TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND THE BUCK STOPS WITH COUNCIL. IT WASN'T AN ACT OF GOD, AND WHETHER IT WAS A CONTRACTOR OR TREE ROOT, WE HAVE TO BE MORE PROACTIVE IN THE FUTURE AND I DON'T MEAN THIS IN AI NEGATIVE WAY. I'M -- A NEGATIVEWAY. I'M SAYING LESSON LEARNED. WE NEED TO PUT MORE OF OUR FOCUS ON BASIC SERVICES AND BASIC INFRASTRUCTURE. THANKS.
01:22:23.547: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN?
01:22:26.550: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR AND THANK YOU TO ALL THE STAFF WOULD HAVE BEEN WORKING DILIGENTLY ON THIS AND TO YOU, COUNCILMEMBER LUMM AND COUNCILMEMBER NELSON FOR YOUR SERVICE ON THE INSURANCE BOARD, I'M SURE AT SOME TIMES YOU WOULD RATHER PULL YOUR HAIR OUT. BUT NO, I MEAN, I THINK THE HIGH HAS BEEN ON THE BALL FOR A LONG TIME. THERE ARE THREE MAIN COMPONENTS OF YOUR SEWAGE SYSTEM. THERE'S WHERE IT GETS FLUSHED. THERE'S THE PIPE THAT CARRIES IT AND THAT'S WHERE IT GOES. WHERE IT GOES IS ONE OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE PIECES OF INFRASTRUCTURE AND IN THE LAST DECADE, WE HAVE INVESTED ABOUT $140 MILLION IN REPLACING OUR WASTEWATER TREATMENT FACILITY. WE HAVE BEEN DILIGENTLY, WITH GREAT CARE, INCREASING THE RATES THAT WE CHARGE OUR SEWAGE CUSTOMERS, SO THAT WE CAN PULL THE MONEY NECESSARY FOR CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN THE BROADER SYSTEM WHICH IS THE PIPES THAT RUN BENEATH THE STREETS. I APPRECIATE ALL THAT INVESTMENT. I APPRECIATE THE COMPLETION OF ONE OF THE LARGEST CAPITAL PROJECTS EVER IN THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. OUR BEAUTIFUL, IF NOT A LITTLE BIT SMELLY, WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT, AND AP APPRECIATE ALL THE GOOD WORK THAT WENT INTO MAKING THAT HAPPEN.
01:23:40.057: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
01:23:41.292: >> Councilmember Hayner: SINCE WE ARE SUBJECT TO FINES AND SO ON FROM EGLE, DO WE GO AFTER THE GUY WHO LEFT 300 FEET OF ROPE IN OUR SEWER?
01:23:54.672: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. CRAWFORD?
01:23:55.306: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I MEAN, IF THIS IS THE CASE WHERE THIS IS CONTRACTOR NEGLIGENCE, CLEARLY, WE SHOULD NOT BE ON THE HOOK FOR THAT.
01:24:05.783: >> City Admin. Crawford: I'M SORRY, MAYOR, I STEPPED AWAY FOR A SECOND.
01:24:10.688: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. HUPY, ARE YOU ABLE?
01:24:12.423: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I FIGURED I WOULD ASK.
01:24:19.163: >> WE ALWAYS REFER BACK TO THE ATTORNEY'S OFFICE TO FIND OUT IF WE HAVE RECOURSE FOR ECONOMIC RECOVERY.
01:24:27.204: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WOULD BE MOST INTERESTED IN TRYING THAT IN THE CASE WHERE IT'S CLEARLY IDENTIFIABLE CONTRACTOR NEGLIGENCE. I KNOW LIKE WHEN THE BRICKS FALL OUT OF THE SURROUNDS OR SOMETHING. WE DIDN'T GET TO THAT ONE. WE DIDN'T GET TO TUCKPOINTING THOSE, BUT THAT'S ON US. WHEN THERE IS AN OBJECT LEFT IN THIS BY THE CONTRACTOR, THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO RECOVER, SOME TYPE OF COST COMMENSURATE.
01:24:58.002: >> COUNCIL MEMBER, I WILL LOOK INTO IT AND LET YOU ALL KNOW.
01:25:01.739: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM? YOU ARE ON MUTE.
01:25:07.511: >> Councilmember Lumm: SORRY. I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY, MR. WILHELM IN THE CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE DOES THIS FOR ALL THE CLAIMS THAT COME TO THE CITY. AND AS DOES PUBLIC WORKS, EVERY -- EVERY -- EVERY OVERFLOW BACKUP THAT WE'RE AWARE OF IS -- IS EXAMINED THOROUGHLY, AND THE CAUSE IS DETERMINED. AND EVERY EFFORT IS MADE TO FIND THE RESPONSIBLE PARTY. AGAIN, THAT'S -- WE SEE THIS ON A ROUTINE BASIS AT THE BOARD OF UINSURANCE. THANK YOU.
01:25:53.657: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BANNER, WE ARE AT 14 MINUTES ON THIS MATTER.
01:25:57.561: >> Councilmember Bannister: BRIEFLY, I WANTED TO THANK COUNCCOUNCILMEMBER EATON FOR PUG THIS ITEM. THE RESOLUTION WOULD NOT CATCH ANYONE'S EYE AND I WOULD LIKE TO CONGRATULATE COUNCILMEMBER EATON FOR HIS EXPERTISE IN OPENING UP THIS VALUABLE DISCUSSION.
01:26:14.578: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? WITH ROLL CALL VOTE, STARTING WITH ME.
01:26:23.754: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
01:26:24.621: >> Councilmember Eaton: YES.
01:26:25.222: >> Councilmember Nelson:  YES.
01:26:28.992: >> Councilmember Smith: YES.
01:26:29.593: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES.
01:26:31.762: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES.
01:26:34.131: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES.
01:26:36.533: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES.
01:26:41.972: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES.
01:26:42.573: >> Councilmember Grand: YES.
01:26:43.173: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES. MOTION CARRIES.
01:26:46.643: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. CA-8, RESOLUTION NUMBER 3, ESTABLISHING A PUBLIC HEARING FOR THE PROPOSED FULLER COURT AND NIXON/TRAVER SIDEWALK GAP PROJECT. MOVED BY BANNISTER AND SECONDED BY LUMM. DISCUSSION BY COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
01:27:05.062: >> Councilmember Bannister:  I THINK I GAVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF A SNEAK PREVIEW ON THIS. STAFF AND I AND THE RESIDENTS AND COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER AND THE OTHER COUNCILMEMBERS, WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS A LOT. AND BECAUSE IT IS TRICKY. YOU MAY REMEMBER -- WELL, JUST FOR CLARIFICATION FOR PEOPLE, STAFF LUMPED FULLER COURT AND NIXON/TRAVER TOGETHER FOR GRANT FUNDING PURPOSES. COME MAY 4, FOR THE PUBLIC HEARING, THEY WILL BE SEPARATED OUT AGAIN, BUT I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT FOR PEOPLE THAT THERE'S A PROJECT WEB PAGE FOR THIS, AND THEY ARE ON THAT PROJECT WEB PAGE, WE HAVE THE PROTEST PETITION FROM THE RESIDENTS. 100% UNANIMOUS FOR THE NIXON/TRAVER SIDEWALK. THEN STAFF PROVIDED INDIVIDUAL RESPONSES TO EACH OF THE ITEMS ON THE PROTEST PETITION. SO THAT'S A GREAT WORKING TOGETHER ON THAT. BUT I WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT THAT THE -- I AGREE WITH THE RESIDENTS THAT AS WE THINK OF THE 150 MILES OF SIDEWALK GAPS AND ALL THE RESIDENTS WOULD WANT SIDEWALK AND WHO THROUGH CLICK FIXES HAVE ASKED CITY HALL TO PLEASE HAVE A SIDEWALK, THAT SPENDING MONEY ON ONE WAY WHERE THE PEOPLE ARE UNANIMOUSLY AGAINST IT, DOESN'T SOUND RIGHT. THE NEIGHBORS HAVE POINTED OUT IN THEIR PROTEST PETITION, THAT THERE ARE NEW BIKE PATHS AND FANCY SIDEWALKS ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE ROAD. SO WE DO HAVE ACCESSIBILITY IN THE AREA GOING ALL THE WAY FROM GREEN TO PLYMOUTH, UP AND DOWN PLYMOUTH. AND THEN THEY ALSO -- THE COST IS AN AVERAGE OF $8,000 PER HOUSEHOLD. AND THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE THE ONGOING COST OF THE SNOW AND ICE REMOVAL. AND THEY POINT OUT THAT THE VIRUS, THE COVID-19 THAT WE ARE DEALING WITH IS ALTERING THE FINANCIAL STATUS IN WAYS THAT WE DON'T KNOW OF OUR INDIVIDUAL HOUSEHOLDS, OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT, OF STATE GOVERNMENT, FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, THE WORLD, AND SO TO BE MOVING FORWARD WITH A QUESTIONABLE SIDEWALK PROGRAM IS -- IS JUST NOT SOMETHING THAT I'M COMFORTABLE WITH. AND IT'S BEEN POINTED OUT THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE ORIGINAL DEVELOPMENT PLANS WHEN THE TOLL BROTHERS AND STUFF WERE PUT -- SUCH WERE PUTTING IN ALL THE ADDITIONAL HOUSING IN THE AREA, THAT MAYBE THAT IN HINDSIGHT WAS THE ABOUT ERR TIME TO SAY THAT YOU SHOULD -- BETTER TIME TO SAY THAT YOU SHOULD FIND WAYS TO PAY FOR THE SIDEWALKS. AGAIN, I DON'T FEEL THAT CITY COUNCIL SHOULD BE TAKING MONEY OUT OF THE POCKETS OF OUR CITIZENS, AND THAT WHEN THEY -- WHEN THE CITIZENS CAN'T GO TO WORK, CAN'T LEAVE THE HOUSE, ARE SCARED ABOUT THE VIRUS, THIS JUST -- WE REALLY NEED TO WORK BETWEEN NOW AND MAY 4 OR WHEN WE VOTE ON THESE SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS. WE REALLY NEED TO WORK ON CLARITY ON OUR SIDEWALK GAPS BECAUSE WE'RE FALLING SHORT AND WE'RE HEARING FROM RESIDENTS AND RESIDENTS ALL ACROSS THE CITY ARE -- WOULD DON'T HAVE A SIDEWALK ARE LOOKING AT THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU.
01:31:16.847: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
01:31:17.781: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I WOULD NOTE I SEE MR. WALL AND MR. HUPY AND HUTCHINSON ARE ALL VISIBLE AND COULD CHIME IN ON THIS. I WOULD MAKE A FEW POINTS THAT THIS GAP PROJECTS. IS THE ONLY REMAINING SIDEWALK WE HAVE ON ON NIXON AND IT WAS RANKED  IN GAP PRIORITIZATION SYSTEM AS HIGH TO MIDHIGH, WHICH LED TO THE INCORPORATION OF THESE PROJECTS IN THE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PLAN. THE FEDERAL AID THAT IS BEING USED TO SIGNIFICANTLY OFFSET THE PROPERTY OWNERS COST, IS PROJECT SPECIFIC. SO IF WE DON'T USE IT HERE, WE LOSE IT BASICALLY. AND THE OFFSET IS SIGNIFICANT. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK MR. WALL AND HUTCHISON FOR THE PUBLIC MEETINGS THAT THEY HELD ON THIS MATTER AND FOR THEIR MANY -- THEY HAVE BEEN VERY RESPONSIVE TO THE RESIDENTS' CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED. AND I DON'T KNOW IF THEY WANT TO SPEAK ADDITIONALLY. THIS PROJECT IS SLATED FOR CONSTRUCTION IN AUGUST. AND THE -- YOU KNOW, IT'S BEEN NOTED THAT A DELAY WOULD LIKELY RESOLVE IN -- AGAIN, IT'S A HIGH PRIORITY SIDEWALK GAP, WOULD RESULT IN GREATER COSTS DOWN THE ROAD, BECAUSE THE OFFSET HERE IS SO SIGNIFICANT. THANK YOU.
01:32:59.416: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
01:33:04.588: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. I WILL ENTHUSIASTICALLY SUPPORT THIS, JUST LIKE I HAVE WITH MANY OTHER SIDEWALK PROJECTS. THIS ONE IN PARTICULAR, AS COUNCILMEMBER LUMM ALLUDED TO, BUT IT FILLS A GAP THAT'S NEAR AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WHERE WE HEAR -- I KNOW IT'S NOT IN MY WARD BUT I KNOW IT WELL ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT WE HAVE HEARD A LOT OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT SO MANY PARENTS DRIVING AND CAUSING TRAFFIC TO THIS PARTICULAR ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, AND IF WE CAN PERHAPS FILL SOME SIDEWALK GAPS, MAYBE WE CAN GET MORE KIDS WALKING AND BIKING TO SCHOOL AND NOT AS MANY OF THEM IN THEIR CARS WHEN WE GO BACK IN SEPTEMBER. SO I WOULD SUPPORT THIS JUST BECAUSE IT'S COUNCIL POLICY AND WHEN WE HAVE A CHANCE TO GET MATCHING FUNDS, BUT THIS ONE STRIKES ME AS THE HIGH PRIORITY FOR A REASON.
01:33:54.504: >> Mayor Taylor: I HAVE COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, BANNISTER, AND WE ARE AT SEVEN MINUTES. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:34:02.946: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  WE SAW FIRST CONVERSATION THAT WE HAD EARLIER TODAY ABOUT GO DOWN IN FLAMES. IT IS UNFORTUNATE. IT REALLY IS, BECAUSE MANY OF US PURPORT TO WANT TO ADDRESS THIS NEED, BUT YET FAILED TO ACT WHEN THE OPPORTUNITY COMES TO DO SO, BECAUSE IT'S NOT A PERFECT SOLUTION, IT'S NOT A PERFECT RESOLUTION. IT'S GROWING INCREASINGLY FRUSTRATING FOR ME TO SEE THESE THINGS CONTINUE TO GET DENIED IN THE QUESTION OF PERFECTION. YOU KNOW, C. C A-22 FAILED. IT FAILED TO GIVE THOSE WHO LIVE IN THAT STRETCH RELIEF FROM THE HIGH ASSESSMENTS. I MEAN, AGAIN, IT JUST -- IT'S BA FLANAS. -- BANANAS. I WILL USE THAT TERM AGAIN THAT WE CONTINUE TO TALK BUT WE DON'T WALK THE WALK WHEN IT COMES TO HELPING AND PROVIDING SIDEWALKS. I MEAN, WE ARE NOT GETTING ANYTHING DONE LOOKING FOR THE PERFECT RESOLUTION. SO I'M VERY DISAPPOINTING IN CA-22 AND I JUST WILL SAY THAT ON THIS CASE HERE AT CA-8, THAT, YOU KNOW, WE NEED TO GET THE STUFF DONE. WE NEED TO COOK WHILE WE EAT AND UNTIL WE GET THAT PERFECT RESOLUTION, WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO FILL THESE GAPS. THANK YOU.
01:35:25.829: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
01:35:26.897: >> Councilmember Bannister:  I JUST WANTED TO RESPOND TO COUNCILMEMBER LUMM AND COUNCILMEMBER GRAND. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM WAS SAYING THAT THIS IS A HIGH PRIORITY PROJECT. I THINK JUST BECAUSE SOMETHING HAS BEEN ON THE C.I.P. PLAN FOR YEARS OR WHATEVER, I THINK THAT WE NEED TO UPDATE OUR CRITERIA FOR HIGH PRIORITY, BECAUSE WHEN YOU ACTUALLY WALK AROUND THE NEIGHBORHOOD, AND MAYBE YOU ALREADY HAVE DONE THAT, OUT BUT, YOU KNOW, I THINK -- BUT, YOU KNOW, I THINK THERE'S CONTROVERSY OVER WHETHER THIS, IN FACT IS A PRIORITY. AND THEN TO COUNCILMEMBER GRAND, ABOUT THE LOGAN SCHOOL, IT'S TRUE LOGAN SCHOOL IS THERE, BUT WE DID HAVE A ZOOM NEIGHBORHOOD MEETING, AND THE -- WE FOUND OUT THAT NO LOGAN SCHOOL STUDENTS, INCLUDING THE ENTIRE NORTH OAKS PROJECT BY THE TOLL BROTHERS WILL NEED TO USE THIS SIDEWALK BECAUSE THERE IS A SIDEWALK FROM THE NORTH OAKS PROJECT NOW ENTERING THE NORTH SIDE OF THE UPPER LOGAN PLAYGROUND, AND THERE'S A PAVED PATH ALL THE WAY TO THE SCHOOL ENTRANCE. SO STUDENT SAFETY IS NOT RELEVANT IN THIS PARTICULAR SIDEWALK. AND WE DON'T HAVE A PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC STUDY TO ESTIMATE HOW MANY NONSTUDENTS WOULD BE USING IT. AS YOU GUYS MENTIONED, IT'S THE LAST SIDEWALK GAP THAT SPEAKS TO THE PLETHORA -- YOU KNOW, THERE'S A TON OF GREAT SIDEWALKS AND BIKE PATHS AND OTHER ROUTES. THANK YOU.
01:37:03.159: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING WITH ME.
01:37:18.074: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
01:37:18.808: >> Councilmember Eaton: YES.
01:37:19.409: >> Councilmember Nelson:  YES.
01:37:23.847: >> Councilmember Smith: YES.
01:37:24.447: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES.
01:37:25.815: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES.
01:37:28.852: >> Councilmember Bannister: NO.
01:37:32.322: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES.

01:37:41.398: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION CARRIES.
01:37:43.466: >> Mayor Taylor: CA-9, RESOLUTION NUMBER 3, ESTABLISHING A PUBLIC HEARING FOR BARTON DRIVE WATER PAIN REPLACEMENT AND RESURFACING PROJECT SPECIAL ASSESSMENT. MOVED BY BANNISTER AND SECONDED BY HAYNER. DISCUSSION OF CA-9, COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
01:38:03.953: >> Councilmember Bannister: OKAY. WE WILL HAVE MR. HAYNER JUMP IN HERE QUICKLY, LIVING RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER FROM THIS PROJECT. AS YOU MAY RECALL, THIS PROJECT ORIGINALLY STARTED WHERE WE WERE GOING TO HAVE SIDEWALK ALL THE WAY FROM PONTIAC TRAIL TO M-14 AND THERE WAS A HUGE OUTCRY IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD BECAUSE IT'S A WOODED AREA, AND IT WAS GOING TO BE A REALLY BAD IDEA AND SO THANKFULLY, WE REACHED CONSENSUS AND A HUGE CHUNK OF THE PROJECT WAS DELETED. IF YOU GO TO THE BARTON DRIVE WEB PAGE, PROJECT WEB PAGE, YOU WON'T SEE THE CURRENT MAPS YET. I THINK A LOT OF WORK CAME TO A SLOWDOWN IN MARCH. BUT STAFF TELLS ME THEY WILL BE PUTTING UP THE CURRENT PROJECT MAPS, BUT NOW WE ARE DOWN TO A SMALLER PIECE, BUT I HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THREE HOUSES, IN PARTICULAR. TWO OF HOUSES -- HOUSEHOLDS ARE INTERESTED IN THE PROJECT, BUT ONLY, IT SEEMS -- THEY WANT THE SIDEWALK, BUT CANNOT AFFORD THE FINANCIAL BURDEN, AND SO THEY REALLY -- IT URGED US IN EMAILS THAT WE WERE SUPPOSED TO PASS THE 50% FUNDING. AND WE WILL HAVE TO SEE WHAT THEY SAY BETWEEN NOW AND MAY 4. BUT THE OTHER HOUSEHOLD THAT I MENTIONED, THE PEOPLE AT 415, THEY ARE THE ONES THAT ARE NOW, I THINK, WE'LL SEE THEIR SPECIAL ASSESSMENT GO UP TO NEARLY 40,000 BECAUSE NECESSITY EITHER HAVE TO MOVE THEIR DRIVEWAY OR GET THIS ELABORATE SWITCHBACK, THOSE ARE THE TWO OPTIONS THAT ARE ON THE WEBSITE, AND THAT CITY STAFF HAS ENGINEERED FOR THEM. AND THEY ARE A SENIOR COUPLE. THEY -- THE -- IF YOU LOOK ON THE GROUND THERE, AT BREED, BARTON AND LONGSHORE, THERE'S VERY LIMITED SIGHT DISTANCE. SO THE IDEA THAT WE NEED TO HAVE A CROSSWALK AND A SIDEWALK TO MEET THE CROSSWALK IS PART OF THE CONTROVERSY. THERE ARE CROSSWALKS IN THIS PROJECT THAT MIGHT -- SINCE WE HAVE NEVER HAD A CROSSWALK BEFORE, TO SUDDENLY HAVE MULTIPLE CROSSWALKS, MAYBE AN OPPORTUNITY WHERE WE COULD DELETE THIS ONE CROSSWALK. SO, AGAIN, I -- THE PROTEST LETTERS FROM THE -- THIS NEIGHBORHOOD HAVE NOT BEEN UPLOADED TO THE WEB PAGE. STAFF TELLS ME THEY WILL UPLOAD THEM AND I SUGGEST YOU READ THESE SADLERS FROM THE PEOPLE WOULD CAN'T AFFORD $40,000 FOR OUR SIDEWALK AND THEY WON'T BE USING IT BECAUSE THEY ARE SENIORS AND ONE OF THEM IS -- YOU KNOW, WELL, I WON'T GET INTO THEIR BUSINESS. BUT I WILL TURN IT OVER TO COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER. BUT I AM -- WE CAN MOVE FORWARD -- I CAN MOVE FORWARD AND AGREE TO THE PUBLIC HEARING, BUT, AGAIN, THESE ARE SOME OF THE MAJOR PROBLEMS WITH THESE -- THE SIDEWALKS ON THIS PROJECT. SOME OF THEM ARE GOOD. IT'S MIXED. SOME ARE GOOD, AND THE OTHERS ARE BAD. AND ON THIS ONE, THE AVERAGE COST PER HOUSEHOLD IS $10,000.
01:41:58.488: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
01:41:59.522: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU. I THINK AS COUNCILWOMAN BANNISTER SAID, AND WE ALL RECOGNIZE, THIS IS A PROBLEM. I APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT WAS DONE ON THE OLD TRAVER PROJECT WHERE ENGINEERING STAFF KIND OF WENT OUT OF THEIR WAY TO COME UP WITH ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS FOR THESE COSTLY SIDEWALK GAP FILLINGS. AND THIS IS ANOTHER INSTANCE WHERE I WOULD URGE THEM TO COME UP WITH A DIFFERENT SOLUTION. OBVIOUSLY FOR THE 23 ODD YEARS I LIVED IN MY HOUSE HERE, RIGHT HERE, YOU KNOW, WE MAY DO WITHOUT IT. NONE OF THE NEIGHBORHOODS TO THE NORTH OF IT HAVE SIDEWALKS. THE CONCERN ON BREED AND LONGSHORE IS THAT IN 2015, I DID A CHANGE.ORG PETITION, BEGGING FOR -- WITH ANOTHER 100 PEOPLE BEGGING FOR A CROSSWALK THERE BECAUSE THERE'S A GOAT PATH CUT BETWEEN THE BARRICADE AND THE SIDEWALK. THAT'S THE HEAD OF THE BOARDWALK. AND SO, YOU KNOW, THANK GOODNESS WE HAVE THAT BOARDWALK THERE. AND WELL USED, WELL LOVED. THIS IS BAK BASICALLY THE HEAD F IT. THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE AT LEAST A APAD ON THE OTHER SIDE, A LANDING PAD OPEN THE OTHER SIDE. NOW WE ARE TALKING ABOUT SIDEWALKS THAT WILL CONTINUE UP TO THIS PAD, BUT NOW THERE'S BEEN AN ELABORATE SIDEWALK BECAUSE OF THE GRATING AND THE TERRAIN THERE. AND $40,000 IS AN INSANE AMOUNT FOR A HOMEOWNER TO PAY FOR A SIDEWALK IN FRONT OF THEIR HOUSE. IT'S -- IT'S BEYOND REASONING. I MEAN, IN -- YOU CAN BUY A HOUSE FOR THAT IN MANY CITIES IN MICHIGAN. AND SO WITH THE SIDEWALKS THAT ARE ALREADY THERE. AND SO IT'S -- IT'S JUST -- IT'S A CRAZY AMOUNT OF MONEY AND I'M KIND OF BEGGING FOR ENGINEERING TO TAKE A LOOK AT AN ALTERNATIVE, WHERE IT'S VERY SLOW. IT'S WINDING. IT'S 25-MILE-PER-HOUR STREET THERE. WE KNOW NOT EVERYBODY DOES THAT BECAUSE IT'S A COMMUTER ACCESS AND SO I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE CROSSWALK GOING IN THERE NO YOU WITH OUR CROSSWALK LAW, THAT IS NOT A UNIFORMED STATE LAW. WE HAVE A LOT OF OUT-OF-CITY PEOPLE USING THAT. WE INTO ED A WAY TO -- WE NEED A WAY TO GET ACROSS THERE SAFELY, BUT THEY DON'T NEED THE EXPENSE OF $40,000 FOR A SIDEWALK. I CAN'T SUPPORT STICKING THAT ON THIS COUPLE. I THINK THERE WAS AN ERROR MADE AND I THINK 9 AND 10 WERE SUPPOSED TO BE PULLED. BUT 10 WASN'T PULLED AND IT WENT BY TO THE PUBLIC HEARING. I GUESS MY QUESTIONS GENERALLY ARE, DO WE REALLY THINK WE WILL BE ABLE TO PULL OFF A PUBLIC HEARING ON MAY 4th FOR THESE FOLKS TO SOMEHOW GET THEIR INPUT? AND, TWO, WHAT CAN WE PLEASE DO BETWEEN NOW AND THEN SHORT OF CUTTING COUNCILMAN NELSON'S SIDEWALK FUND TO EASE THE PAIN FOR THESE FOLKS WHO HAVE A ZERO WAY OF PAYING FOR THIS? I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE DON'T JUST ROLL THIS IN OUR RESURFACING PROJECTS THAT ARE ADJACENT. I KNOW THERE'S A TECHNICAL REASON FOR IT. WE'RE A WEALTHY COMMUNITY. I THINK WE COULD DO THAT IN SOME EVER THESE CASES AND THIS IS ESPECIALLY A CASE WHERE WE ARE WORKING RIGHT THERE. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE IT TORN UP RIGHT THERE. SO I JUST -- I'M GOING TO CHAIN WITH CM BANNISTER AND SAY I CAN'T DO IT TO THESE PEOPLE. I JUST CAN'T.
01:45:25.895: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
01:45:26.996: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES, SORRY. I WANT TO THANK STAFF. OUR STAFF HAVE BEEN WORKING OVERTIME ON THESE. AND WE HAVE BEEN HAVING LENGTHY, TOTALLY UNPROFESSIONAL CONVERSATIONS AT COUNCIL. AND I BELIEVE THAT WE ARE MISSING ONE COMPONENT TO OUR TEAM AND THAT IS EYE VISION ZERO EXPERT WHO CAN WORK WITH THE HOMEOWNERS, COME UP WITH A SOLUTION THAT DOESN'T COST $40,000 WITH A SWITCHBACK. WE ALSO I NEED TO HAVE CROSSWALK DESIGN STANDARDS THAT INCLUDE LIGHTING. I'M REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT ADDING ADDITIONAL CROSSWALKS THIS SEASON, WHEN WE HAVE CROSSWALKS FROM LAST SEASON THAT STILL DO NOT HAVE ANY LIGHTING. WE LOST A STUDENT IN 2016 DUE DO AN UNLIT CROSSWALK. SINCE THAT TIME, WE HAVE CONSTRUCTED AT LEAST 10 ADDITIONAL CROSSWALKS IDENTICAL TO THE ONE WHERE WE HAD A FATALITY. I REALLY THINK WE NEED TO GET THIS EXPERT SO THAT THIS PERSON CAN BRING US ALL TOGETHER. WE HAVE TO HAVE DESIGN GUIDELINES AND, AGAIN, WE HAVE GOT TO DO IT RIGHT FIRST TIME. THANK YOU.
01:46:43.506: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION?
01:46:45.074: >> MAYOR, JUST FOR CLARIFICATION -- JUST FOR CLARIFICATION, ON THIS PROJECT, I BELIEVE THAT THE HIGHEST ASSESSMENT IS PRESENTLY $18,000. IT'S STILL HIGH, BUT IT'S NOT 40, JUST FOR CLARIFICATION.
01:46:57.687: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. FURTHER -- COUNCILMEMBER EATON. WE'RE AT NINE MINUTES. COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
01:47:09.498: >> Councilmember Eaton: I WILL BE VOTING FOR THIS BECAUSE IT JUST SETS UP A PUBLIC HEARING. I'M RELUCTANT TO PLACE AN ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL BURDEN ON HOMEOWNERS AS WE SENT WHAT LOOKS LIKE A SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. AND SO I HOPE WE LEARN ENOUGH BY THE TIME THE PUBLIC HEARING HAS BEEN HELD, TO REALLY SEE HOW BADLY WE ARE GOING TO HAMMER THESE PEOPLE. II'M RELUCTANT TOHAVE A FINANCIN ANYBODY AS THE ECONOMY. I WILL VOTE ON CA-8, BA US IT MERELY SETS UP A PUBLIC HEARING.
01:47:53.042: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
01:47:53.976: >> Councilmember Bannister:  I WANT TO CHECK WITH MR. CRAWFORD ON THAT. IF THAT WAS, IN FACT, THE CASE, BUT MY -- AND I WANTED TO DOUBLE CHECK WITH MAYBE THE PROJECT MANAGER'S NICK HUTCHINS OR JANE HALEN, BECAUSE IT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING WAS THAT THE SPECIAL ASSESSMENT WAS NET OF THE SUPPOSED 50% REDUCTION. COULD WE JUST CONFIRM THAT, WHETHER WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE $19,000 OR THE $38,000?
01:48:32.515: >> I WILL ASK OUR PROJECT MANAGER JANE ALLEN TO JUMP IN HERE. I THINK SHE PROBABLY HAS THE MORE DETAILED NUMBERS IN FRONT OF HER. GO AHEAD, JANE.
01:48:40.589: >> HELLO, JANE ALLEN, PROJECT MANAGER FOR THE BARTON ROAD PROJECT. THE HIGHEST ESTIMATED ASSESSMENT AT THIS POINT IS AT 415 BARTON DRIVE AND $18,700. THESE NUMBERS IN THE ASSESSMENT RULE DID NOT INCLUDE THE PROPOSED 50% REDUCTION THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN VOTED ON TODAY.
01:49:04.113: >> Councilmember Bannister: OKAY. WELL, THAT IS -- THAT IS BETTER NEWS, CERTAINLY. IT'S STILL A BIG CHUNK.
01:49:13.956: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION?
01:49:15.691: >> Councilmember Bannister:  I JUST WANTED TO MENTION AS COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD SAYS, IT DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY LIGHTING ON THE PROPOSED CROSSWALKS. SO THAT'S ANOTHER SERIOUS --
01:49:27.203: >> NO, WE ALREADY HAVE AGREEMENTS SIGNED WITH D.T.E. TO INSTALL CROSS LIGHTS. POSITIVE CONTRAST LIGHTING AT EACH OF THESE PROPOSED CROSSWALKS.
01:49:38.114: >> Councilmember Bannister: OKAY. AND WILL WE GET A MAP ON THAT OR THAT WILL BE COMING PRIOR TO MA?
01:49:44.720: >> WELL, THE AGREEMENTS ARE SIGNED. SO IF THE SIDEWALKS GO IN AND THE CROSSWALKS THEN GET IN, THEN D.T.E. WILL STALL THE LIGHTING.
01:49:53.929: >> Councilmember Bannister: THANK YOU.
01:49:57.066: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD?
01:50:02.238: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I HATE TO CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION, BUT ACCORDING TO AN EMAIL THAT WE RECEIVED FROM THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR TODAY, WE HAVE CONTRACTS WITH D.T.E. FOR CROSSWALK LIGHTING THAT HAVE NOT BEEN COMPLETED YET. SO MY REQUEST WOULD BE THAT WE DO NOT CONSTRUCT A CROSSWALK, MEANING WE DON'T PAINT THE STREET. WE DON'T PUT THE SIGNS IN UNTIL WE HAVE THE POSITIVE CONTRAST LIGHTING BECAUSE THAT IS CRITICAL. AND WE DON'T REALLY -- WE CAN'T REALLY CONTROL WHEN THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IF WE ARE CONTRACTING WITH D.T.E.
01:50:39.909: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING WITH ME.
01:50:50.319: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
01:50:52.321: >> Councilmember Eaton: YES.
01:50:52.922: >> Councilmember Nelson: SORRY, YES.
01:50:59.962: >> Councilmember Smith: YES.
01:51:00.563: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES.
01:51:04.466: >> Councilmember Hayner:  NO.

01:51:19.615: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION CARRIES.
01:51:22.051: >> Mayor Taylor: CA-16 RESOLUTION TO AUTHORIZE AMENDMENT NUMBER 3 TO THE TETRA TECH ENGINEERING SERVICES AGREEMENT TO SAMPLE THE TEST WET BASEMENTS IN HIGH RISK AREAS IN ANN ARBOR FOR 1, 4 DIOXANE AND APPROPRIATE FUNDS FROM THE RISK FUND, FUND BALANCE 40,323. MOVED BY RAMLAWI AND ACKERMAN. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, DISCUSSION?
01:51:47.443: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS, THANKFULLY. I JUST WANTED TO PAY A THANKS TO BRIAN STEGLITZ AND STAFF IN HELPING ME CRAFT THIS IN THE SUPPORT WITH COUNCILMEMBER SMITH. THERE WAS A CALL IN AN EMAIL I GOT LATE LAST YEAR FROM A CONSTITUENT WHOSE PROPERTY SITS ABOVE THE PROHIBITION ZONE, ACROSS THE STREET FROM -- WEST OF WEST PARK. CONCERNED ABOUT THE GROUNDWATER COMING INTO THE HOUSE AND WHETHER IT CONTAINED DIOXANE, AND TO GET IT TESTED. AND SO, I QUICKLY MADE A COUPLE OF CALLS AND I FOUND OUT THAT THE HOME OPENER WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE -- THE HOMEOWNER WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE, IN THAT CASE TO HAVE A COMPANY COME OUT AND SAMPLE THE GROUNDWATER THAT WAS COMING INTO THE BASEMENT, THAT THEY WERE CONCERNED WITH. SO I DIDN'T FEEL THAT WAS A GOOD RESPONSE. I DIDN'T THINK THAT WAS THE RESPONSE I SHOULD GIVE THE CONSTITUENTS WITH WE HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THE GELMAN PLUME AND THERE'S DETECTIONS IN WEST PARK. AND AS -- AS AN ELECTED OFFICIAL, I SAY, WELL, YOU WILL HAVE TO PAY A PRIVATE COMPANY TO COME AND SAMPLE IT, AND THEN ONCE YOU GET THAT INFORMATION, I'M NOT SURE IF THEY ARE GOING TO USE IT, BECAUSE IT WAS DONE UNDER SOMEONE ELSE'S CONTROL AND DIRECTION. SO ANYHOW, I REACHED OUT TO OUR CITY ADMINISTRATOR AND I REACHED OUT TO OTHERS AND MR. HEWNY TO COME UP WITH A BETTER RESPONSE THE NEXT TIME A CONSTITUENT HAS A CONCERN WITH GROUNDWATER COMING INTO THEIR BASEMENT, IN THAT PART OF OUR CITY. SO I AM EXCITED TO SEE THAT THIS IS ON TONIGHT'S AGENDA. I HOPE THAT IT DOES GET THE SUPPORT OF COUNCIL. THIS ISN'T GOING TO BREAK THE BANK. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT $40,000 THAT WILL HELP EASE THE CONCERN AND PERHAPS GET US SOME ANSWERS ON WHAT'S GOING ON UNDERNEATH THESE PEOPLE'S HOMES IN THAT AREA WEST OF WEST PARK. SO IT'S ABOUT  85 RESIDENCES BASED OPEN THE PARAMETERS STAFF HAVE LAID OUT, AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO HAVING THIS PUT IN PLACE. SO OUR PUBLIC AND THE CONSTITUENTS THAT I SERVE ARE SERVED WELL.
01:54:39.448: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
01:54:41.583: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. YES, WE DEFINITELY WANT TO VOTE FOR. THIS WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON UNDER OUR CITY AND IT COULD BE VERY INFORMATIVE IN THE ONGOING NEGOTIATIONS. WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS HERE. I JUST WANTED TO THROW IT OUT THERE IN THE PUBLIC AND I WILL SEND A PRIVATE EMAIL TO THE APPROPRIATE FOLKS, THAT THERE HAS BEEN A REQUEST TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE WEST PARK BAND SHELL BASEMENT FOR A VAPOR INTRUSION EXPERIMENT BY MR. BOB BAILEY, WOULD SITS ON THE CARD GROUP. AND HE DID A -- HE HAD A REALLY NICE PRESENTATION, A POSTER PRESENTATION OF THE PFAS AND PVD A COUPLE OF MONTHS BACK. THE CONCERN IS THAT HE HAS DONE SOME MODEL OF VAPOR INTRUSION METHODS IN CLOSE ENVIRONMENTS LIKE A BASEMENT WOULD BE, OR THE BASEMENT OF THE WEST PARK BAND SHEBANDSHELL AND IT SHOWS THAT E GROUNDWATER NUMBERS -- THE CORRELATION ARE POTENTIALLY NOT -- THAT IT'S THE WRONG CONNECTION. THAT THERE MAY BE, INDEED MORE VAPOR PRESENT THAN THERE IS THIS -- I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE SCIENCE BEHIND IT. I TOOK A PICTURE OF IT AND I HAD THEM EXPLAIN IT. THEY WANT TO RUN A A PICTURE TO VERIFY OR DISPROVE HIS MATH ON IT. I DON'T THINK THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE USING THE BANDSHELL THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE MAYBE COUNCILWOMAN GRAND AND I, SHE COULD LET ME KNOW WHO MIGHT HAVE THE KEY FOR THAT AND TO WORK WITH THE LEGAL DEPARTMENT TO GIVE TEMPORARY ACCESS TO SET UP THE EQUIPMENT AND TEMPORARY ACCESS TO REMOVE THE EQUIPMENT AND DO THIS TEST TOTALLY ON THEIR DIME. THEY JUST NEED A SPACE AND WE THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE BETTER TO DO IT IN A PUBLIC SPACE THAN SOMEONE'S BASEMENT. IT'S A CONTINUATION OF WHAT WE ARE ABOUT TO VOTE ON AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE CONTINUE TO DO OUR OWN SCIENCE AND EXPLORATION OF WHAT'S HAPPENING UNDERNEATH OUR STREETS.
01:56:55.484: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER - - DID I MISS YOU COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
01:57:02.124: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES, MY HAND DISAPPEARED. VERY QUICKLY, I WANTED TO THANK COUNCIL RAMLAWI FOR PROVIDING THE BACKGROUND ON WHAT BROUGHT THIS FORWARD, AND I APPRECIATE HIS WORK ON THIS. AND MR. STEGLITZ'S. I FULLY AGREE DOING THIS ADDITIONAL TESTING IS A GOD AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE CITY SHOULD BEAR THE COST OF AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH, AND FOR RAMLAWI AND SMITH FOR SPONSORING THIS.
01:57:34.156: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
01:57:44.866: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I DON'T KNOW IF STAFF WANTS TO WEIGH IN ON THIS, BUT ONE OF THE THINGS I LEARNED IN THE FIRST MEETING WITH MR. HUPY AND STEGLITZ, THE AMOUNT OF DIOXANE THAT IS IN THE LAUNDRY DETERGENT WE USE AND THE HOUSEHOLD PRODUCTS THAT WE USE. I THINK MANY FOLKS IN OUR COMMUNITY ARE UNAWARE OF THE TOXINS WE ARE BRINGING INTO OUR HOME AND APPLYING TO OUR CLOTHES AND APPLYING ALL AROUND OURSELVES. AND I'M NOT SURE IF NOW IS THE TIME, BUT I THINK IN THE NEAR FUTURE, IF WE CAN BETTER INFORM OUR COMMUNITY OF THE AMOUNTS OF DIOXANE, JUST IN, YOU KNOW, OF TIDE LAUNDRY DETERGENT, THE ASTRONOMICAL LEVELS DIOXANE. THAT'S ONE OF THE CHALLENGES IN DOING THE TESTING, IS MAKING SURE WE DON'T HAVE CROSS CONTAMINATION WITH THE HOUSEHOLD PRODUCTS. I DON'T KNOW IF STAFF WANTS TO EDUCATE THE PUBLIC WHILE WE HAVE A FEW SECONDS.
01:58:49.631: >> I WILL SPEAK TO THAT. THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY IN THE OUTLINE PROPOSAL, WE ARE DOING AN INVENTORY OF THE MATERIAL IN THE BASEMENT. SO THAT THERE CAN BE A BACKGROUND UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE THE 1, 4, I MA M MAY BE CG FROM OTHER THAN GROUNDWATER. YOU ARE CORRECT, THERE ARE A LARGE NUMBERS OF ITEMS THAT WE HAVE IN OUR HOUSEHOLDS THAT CONTAIN, 1, 4.
01:59:33.208: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] ALL OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. I'M SORRY. I MUST HAVE -- HOLD ON A SECOND. MY APOLOGIES. I GOT MY NUMBERS WRONG. DOES THAT REQUIRE A ROLL CALL?
01:59:57.399: >> Clerk Beaudry: A ROLL CALL IS RECOMMENDED.
01:59:59.601: >> Mayor Taylor: MY APOLOGIES. IF WE CAN PULL THAT BACK. I GUESS I WOULD JUST -- BEFORE PULLING IT BACK, I WANT TO SAY TOO, I'M DELIGHTED THAT WE ARE MOVING FORWARD WITH. THIS I CONCUR WITH MY COLLEAGUES THAT IT IS RIGHT AND PROPER THAT THE CITY BEAR THE COST OF LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE PLUME, NATURE OF THE CONTAMINANTS TO THE EXTENT THAT WE FIND THEM IN PEOPLE'S BASEMENTS TO PROVIDE COMFORT AND INFORMATION AND SCIENCE TO OUR RESIDENTS. FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING WITH ME.
02:00:38.140: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
02:00:38.640: >> Councilmember Eaton: YES.
02:00:39.241: >> Councilmember Nelson:  YES.
02:00:44.212: >> Councilmember Smith: YES.
02:00:44.813: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES.

02:00:58.727: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION CARRIES.
02:01:01.663: >> Mayor Taylor: CA LIVE T25, RESOLUTION TO APPROVE AN AGREEMENT WITH THE DOWNTOWN DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY FOR THE DESIGN OF THE SOUTH STATE STREET AND NORTH UNIVERSITY IMPROVEMENTS IN THE AMOUNT OF 396,752, MOVED BY HAYNER, SECONDED BY SMITH. DISCUSSION OF CA-25, COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
02:01:17.712: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. SO I JUST BROUGHT THIS FORWARD BECAUSE AS WE ARE ALL TOO WELL AWARE, THERE'S GOING TO BE SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC IMPACTS FROM WHAT WE ARE GOING THROUGH WILL RIGHT NOW AND I'M NOT SO CERTAIN THAT TYING THE ABOVE GROUND POTENTIAL STREETSCAPE IMPROVEMENTS TO THE NECESSARY AND ALREADY SCHEDULED BELOW GROUND IMPROVEMENTS IS NECESSARILY THE RIGHT WAY FOR THE DOWNTOWN DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY TO SPEND THEIR MONEY AND I RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS JUST A COST SHARING FOR THE PRELIMINARY DESIGN OF THIS PROJECT, ABOVE AND BELOW THE GROUND, AND THE CITY'S COST, A DECENT PORTION OF THE CITY'S COST IN THIS CASE IS 396,000 SOME DOLLARS IS RELATED TO WATER MAIN AND STORMWATER AND RAILWAY AND SURVEYING AND SO ON. THE D.D.A.'S SHARE OF THIS IS 360,000 SOME DOLLARS AND THAT'S FOR EVERYTHING THAT'S ABOVE. THEY ARE PAYING SOME FOR TRAFFIC CONTROL AND STREETSCAPE AND LIGHTING AND SIGNAL DESIGN AND ENGINEERING. THEY ARE SPLIT WITH US ON THAT 50/50. AND SO IT'S TYPICALLY FAIR THAT THE DIFFERENT PORTIONS ARE BEING PAID FOR. AND YELTSIN, WE ARE LOOKING AT, WHAT, 700 AND SOME -- AND YET, WE ARE LOOKING AT $753,000 FOR DESIGN ON THIS PROJECT, ONLY HALF OF WHICH APPEARS TO BE NECESSARY. I NO H KNOW THAT WE WOULD BE PAG MORE FOR THE CITY IF WE WERE NOT SPLITTING PROJECT COORDINATION AND OUTREACH AND SOME OF THE MOBILITY STUDIES AND TRAFFIC ANALYSIS, BUT I'M NOT CERTAIN THAT WE WOULD NEED TO DO THOSE STUDIES TO THE EXTENT THAT IS NECESSARY FOR THIS STREETSCAPE IMPROVEMENTS AND I'M ALSO NOT CERTAIN THAT THE STREETSCAPE IMPROVEMENTS ARE THE RIGHT WAY TO BE SPENDING OUR RAPIDLY REDUCING D.D.A. FUNDS WHEN THEY MAY BE NEEDED FOR, YOU KNOW, SUPPORTING LOCAL BUSINESSES AND OTHER THINGS LIKE THAT. SO I -- I DON'T SUPPORT THIS COST SHARING AGREEMENT, SIMPLY BECAUSE I DON'T FIND STREETSCAPE IMPROVEMENTS AS NECESSARY AS WHAT IS GOING ON UNDERNEATH, ESPECIALLY AT THIS COST. I WANT TO PUT THAT OUT THIS AND I WILL NOT SUPPORT IT. THANK YOU.
02:03:28.777: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
02:03:31.112: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. YEAH, I -- I THINK ANY TIME WE ARE GOING TO SEE THESE RESOLUTIONS COME FORTH, THERE'S GOING TO BE INCREASING SCRUTINY AND LESS AND LESS SUPPORT. THE D.D.A.'S PATH IN THE LAST FIVE OR TEN, 15 YEARS WITH STREETSCAPE PROJECTS, TO ME, I -- I COMPARE IT TO OWNING A HOUSE. ME AND MY PARTNER ARE ON A VERY LIMITED FIXED BUDGET AND WE HAVE MANY NEEDS IN OUR HOME, ONE OF THEM IS A NEW ROOF AND OTHERS ARE DECORATIVE, LIKE FURNITURE. AND OUR D.D.A. SEEMS TO CONCERN ITSELF WITH BUYING NEW FURNITURE FOR THE HOUSE EVERY THREE TO FIVE YEARS, WHILE OUR ROOF IS LEAKING. I -- I HAVE A HARD TIME -- AND I'M SORRY, I JUST LOST CONNECTION FOR A SECOND. I HAVE A HARD TIME CONTINUING TO SUPPORT THIS POLICY OF STREETSCAPING, WHEN MANY OTHER NEEDS IN OUR COMMUNITY ARE LEFT UNMET. IT'S JUST, I THINK, A TIME TO REEREEVALUATE THE PURPOSE OF THE D.D.A. AND THE NEED OF OUR COMMUNITY. THEY ARE BY FAR THE PART OF OUR GOVERNMENT WHO CAN HELP WITH OUR INFRASTRUCTURE. WE JUST TALKED EARLIER ABOUT SEWAGE SPILLS. YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO FAR TO TALK TO ANYONE ABOUT THE TERRIBLE STATE OF OUR ROADS, CROSSWALKS THAT ARE HARD, NOT JUST -- NOT THE FACT THAT THEY ARE UNLIT, BUT THEY ARE CRUMBLING. I MEAN YOU HAVE TRIP HAZARDS IN YOUR DOWNTOWN CROSSWALKS. YOU HAVE ALL SORTS OF OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS, LOW HANGING FRUIT THAT SIMPLY IS NOT DONE, BUT WE KEEP BUYING NEW FURNITURE EVERY FIVE YEARS. SO, LOOK -- LOOK FOR ME TO HAVE LESS SUPPORT FOR THESE ITEMS. I WANT TO SEE MORE BEING PUT IN OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AND LESS PUT ON MAKEUP AND COSMETICS. I JUST DON'T SEE THE BENEFIT AND I DON'T SEE THE PAYBACK AND I SEE BIGGER NEEDS IN OUR COMMUNITY.
02:06:05.567: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
02:06:08.536: >> MAYOR? I JUST WANTED -- IN CASE IT'S NOT CLEAR TO YOU ALL, SUSAN PAULY, THE D.D.A. DIRECTOR IS AVAILABLE ON AUDIO, BUT YOU WON'T SEE HER ON VIDEO.
02:06:16.911: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
02:06:19.914: >> Clerk Beaudry: YOU'RE WELCOME.
02:06:21.649: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
02:06:23.151: >> Councilmember Bannister: PROFESS TO BE AN EXPERT ON THIS SUBJECT, HOWEVER, I DID RECEIVE A CALL FROM THE STATE STREET AREA ASSOCIATION AND THEY DID SAY THAT THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN IN THE WORKS FOR FIVE YEARS OR SO, AND IT WILL -- IT IS DESIGNED IN PART TO HELP WITH THE FLOODING OUT IN FRONT OF THE NICKELS ARCADE AND PIVOWACK IN JULY WHICH IS ALSO DURING THE ART FAIR. SO MAYBE THAT IS -- I AGREE WITH COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER AND RAMLAWI ABOUT NOT WASTING MONEY ON STREETSCAPES WHEN WE HAVE PRIORITIES WITH OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AND OUR CROSSWALKS AND OUR ROADS AND OUR SNOW REMOVAL AND OUR SIDEWALKS, BUT I WOULD LIKE TO ASK SOMEONE WHETHER IT WOULD BE SUSAN PAULY, OR SOMEONE ELSE, FOR MORE DETAIL ABOUT HOW MUCH OF THIS IS THE COSMETIC AND HOW MUCH IS STOPPING WITH THE FLOODING.
02:07:35.356: >> Mayor Taylor: MS. PALAY.
02:07:36.424: >> YES, THIS IS SUSAN PAYLAY, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
02:07:40.295: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
02:07:40.795: >> THE VAST MAJORITY OF THIS PROJECT IS, IN FACT, INFRASTRUCTURE NOTED, THE ROADWAY IS CRUMBLING. THE SIDEWALKS TOO ARE CRUMBLING. MUCH OF THIS AREA HAS UNDER SIDEWALK VAULTS, WHICH WE WERE NOT ABLE TO ATTEND TO 20 YEARS AGO, WHEN WE WERE IN THAT AREA LOOKING TO DO SOME IMPROVEMENTS. WE HAVE NOW A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CITY, THAT HAS ALLOWED US TO TACKLE THESE UNDER SIDEWALK VAULTS AND A NUMBER OF OTHER AREAS, WHICH WILL ALLOW US TO REPAIR A LOT OF CRUMBLING SIDEWALKS. THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TOO, TO ADDRESS A CHALLENGE IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD, WHICH IS TO DESIGN THE AREA ABOVE, ABOVE THE ROADWAY, TO MEET THE CHALLENGING DEMANDS OF COMPETITION. WE HAVE SIDEWALK CAFES. WE HAVE A NEED FOR LOADING ZONES. WE HAVE A NEED FOR PEDESTRIAN AREA, AND THROUGH A ROBUST ENGAGEMENT PROCESS, WE HAVE A CHANCE TO TALK TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD, WORK WITH THE NEIGHBORHOOD THAT WHEN WE REPAIR THESE SIDEWALKS, THEY ARE DESIGNED SO IT MEETS THE NEED. AN EXAMPLE, YOU COULD EXPAND THE SIDEWALK BUT LOSE LOADING ZONES OR RETAIN LOADING ZONES BUT HAVE TO CONSTRAIN THE CALF CAFE AREA. WE ARE TOUCHING THE SIDEWALK ANYWAY BECAUSE OF ALL OF THOSE UNDER SIDEWALK VAULTS. WHEN THE VAST MAJORITY OF THIS PROJECT IS, IN FACT, INFRASTRUCTURE, THERE IS NICETIES, THERE IS NOT ENOUGH SIDEWALK FOR A GREAT DEAL OF STREETSCAPE. IT'S UNFORTUNATE THE WORD THAT IS USED. IN FACT, IT'S THE AREA OF THE PEDESTRIAN REALM. AS A PEOPLE-FRIENDLY STREET PROJECT, OUR PRIMARY GOAL IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD IS VISION ZERO, TO SUPPORT THE COUNCIL'S ANNOUNCED POLICY OF VISION ZERO, WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO -- WITH THE CITY'S HELP AS WE DID ON WILLIAMS STREET, AND AS WE DID AT FIFTH AND DETROIT. WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE CONDITIONS FOR VULNERABLE USERS, INCLUDING BICYCLISTS, PEOPLE IN WHEELCHAIRS AND OTHER MOBILITY DEVICES, PEDESTRIANS AND SO FORTH. THIS IS A VERY HIGH PEDESTRIAN AREA AND CERTAINLY, THERE'S VERY LITTLE IN DOWNTOWN THAT HAS AS MUCH VISION ZERO GAINS AS THIS WILL AND, AGAIN, WORKING WITH THE CITY, WE CAN POINT TO SUCCESSES HOW WORKING TOGETHER WE HAVE SAVED COSTS FOR BOTH AND TACKLED A LOT OF OUTSTANDING INFRASTRUCTURE.
02:10:14.615: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER SMITH?
02:10:19.420: >> Councilmember Smith: THANK YOU, MS. PALAY. YOU TALKED ABOUT A LOT OF WHAT I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT, NAMELY THAT THIS IS A COMPLICATED ENGINEERING EXERCISE WITH ALL OF THESE VAULTS. I THINK WE IMPROPERLY THROW STREETSCAPE AROUND TO A COSMETIC FIX TO THINGS WHEN IT'S A LOT OF REALLY DIFFICULT, HARD SCAPE WORK THAT IS INFRASTRUCTURE. SO I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS. THIS HAS BEEN SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE NEEDED TO DO, SINCE WE CONVERTED THOSE STREETS FROM ONE WAYS FROM 20 YEARS AGO. I THINK THE APPROACH IS GOOD AND I'M GLAD WE ARE GETTING ON WITH IT.
02:11:06.634: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
02:11:09.637: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES. THE LATEST FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS THAT I HEARD THIS AFTERNOON IS THAT WE ARE GOING INTO A RECESSION THAT WILL PROBABLY BE DEEPER THAN OUR GREAT RECESSION IN 2008. GIVEN THAT, IS IT POSSIBLE TO POSTPONE THIS FOR APPROXIMATELY THREE MONTHS UNTIL WE HAVE A BETTER GRASP OF NOT ONLY WHAT OUR REVENUE STREAM IS GOING TO BE LIKE, BUT ALSO WHAT OUR NEEDS -- JUST OUR BASIC NEEDS FOR OUR LESS FORTUNATE INDIVIDUALS? I'M REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT COMMITTING TO A PROJECT OF THIS SIZE WHEN WE DON'T KNOW WHAT OUR FINANCIAL HEALTH IS GOING TO BE LIKE, AND SO THE QUESTION IS: WHAT'S THE IMPACT IF WE DELAY THIS THREE MONTHS?
02:12:06.627: >> Mayor Taylor: MS. PALAY?
02:12:07.228: >> IF POSSIBLE, I WOULD LIKE MY COLLEAGUES IN ENGINEERING TO HELP ANSWER THAT QUESTION. AS MENTIONED THIS IS A PROJECT THAT'S BEEN DEFERRED, AND SO I WILL LEAN ON MR. HUPY AND MAYBE NICK, IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND AS WELL, ANSWERING THE QUESTION.
02:12:29.517: >> NICK, DO YOU WANT TO ANSWER IT?
02:12:34.122: >> THE PROJECT IS SCHEDULED FOR CONSTRUCTION IN 2021. IT IS  A COMPLEX PROJECT. THERE'S A LOT OF COORDINATION WITH THE BUSINESS OWNERS, WITH THE UNIVERSITY. IT'S -- WE FEEL LIKE WE ARE ON A TIGHT TIMELINE ALREADY IN ORDER TO MEET THE 2021 CONSTRUCTION. A DELAY OF THREE MONTHS WOULD PROBABLY COST US AT LEAST A PORTION OF THE 2021 CONSTRUCTION BECAUSE OF THE TIGHT TIME FRAME WE ARE ON.
02:13:03.684: >> Councilmember Griswold: OKAY. THANK YOU. AND THEN THERE'S THE POSSIBILITY OF DOING IT IN 2022. AGAIN, THERE'S SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL UNCERTAINTY, AND THERE ARE LOTS OF -- MANY, MANY OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE THE STREETSCAPE, PEDESTRIAN SAFETY, BY FILLING IN THE POTHOLES IN THE CROSSWALKS, I KNOW THAT ON MAYNARD IN FRONT OF THE BAR THERE, I CAN'T REMEMBER -- SCORE KEEPERS, THAT THERE IS A HUGE CHUNK OF CONCRETE THAT HAS BEEN MISSING FOR AT LEAST THREE YEARS PER A2FIXIT AND AT LEAST NOW IT HAS PINK FLUORESCENT PAINT AROUND IT, BUT I SEE A LOT OF SMALLER PROJECTS THAT WE COULD DO WITH VERY LITTLE RISK WHILE WE WAIT AND GET A BETTER GRASP OF OUR FINANCIAL POSITION.
02:13:56.604: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
02:13:58.172: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. YEAH, ACTUALLY, SCORE KEEPERS GOT AHOLD OF ME BECAUSE I HOLD INSURANCE TO CLOSE THE RIGHT-OF-WAY TO DO THAT CURB REPAIR. WE WEREN'T SURE IF IT WAS HIS RESPONSIBILITY OR OUR RESPONSIBILITY, OR THE D.D.A.s. THAT HAS BEEN CHUNKED FOR QUITE A WHILE NOW. I UNDERSTAND THAT THE CITY PUT FORWARD THIS VISION ZERO GOAL, BUT I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT HIGH TRAFFIC DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN DANGEROUS, ALTHOUGH I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THIS IS A DANGEROUS AREA, BECAUSE IT'S PROBABLY THE PLACE WHERE I SEE -- WHERE MORE THAN NOT, I SEE PEOPLE CROSSING WITH COMPLETE ABANDON. SO WHAT IS -- WHAT IS TOTAL COST OF THIS PROJECT? AND IS THE DIVISION OF THE TOTAL COST OF THE PROJECT ANALOGOUS TO THE DIVISION WE ARE SEEING HERE FOR THE DESIGN, THE PAVEMENT OF THE TOTAL COST OF THE PROJECT? HOW MUCH OF THIS IS THE CITY FOOTING THE BILL FOR? AND HOW MUCH IS THE ENTITY CALLED THE D.D.A.? IS THERE A SENSE OF THAT?
02:14:57.698: >> YES, THIS IS SUSAN. WE ARE LOOKING TO SPLIT THE COST AS WE HAVE FOR OUR OTHER PROJECTS, WHERE THERE'S A DIVISION ON THE ROAD REPAIR AND RECONSTRUCTION. THERE WILL BE ELEMENTS THAT THE D.D.A. WILL TH TAKE ON, FOR INSTANCE BETTER LIGHTING. WE TALKED ABOUT THAT AT CROSSWALK EARLIER. ROUGHLY THE WHOLE PROJECT, REGARDING THE WATER MAIN REPLACEMENT, THE TWO WATER MAIN CONSOLIDATIONS, THE ROAD REPAIR, THE SIDEWALK REPAIRS, THE VAULT REPAIRS, WE ARE LOOKING AT APPROXIMATELY $6 MILLION ALL TOLD. AS WE DESIGN THIS, WE'LL BE IN A MUCH BETTER POSITION TO UNDERSTAND THE DETAIL OF HOW MUCH IS GOING TO BE APPORTIONED TO WHICH ELEMENT, AND THAT'S WHERE THE DESIGN PROCESS COMES IN. BUT, YES, EFFECTIVELY SPLITTING THIS, LARGELY 50/50.
02:15:55.389: >> Councilmember Hayner: OKAY. THANK YOU.
02:15:57.925: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
02:15:59.427: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT A TREND THAT I'M A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED ABOUT THAT I'M HEARING FROM A LOT OF MY COLLEAGUES. YOU KNOW, WHICH IS I'M NOT GOING TO SUPPORT THIS POLICY THAT I HAVEN'T SUPPORTED IN THE PAST BUT THIS TIME IT'S BECAUSE OF COVID-19 AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE NOT USING THAT AND THOSE UNKNOWNS. YOU KNOW, IF YOU SUPPORTED POLICY, SUPPORT IT. IF YOU DON'T, DON'T. BUT IF YOU -- YOU KNOW, JUST -- I THINK WE JUST -- THERE'S SO MANY UNKNOWNS AND WE'LL OBVIOUSLY, YOU KNOW, WE KNOW THEY ARE COMING AND WE'LL DEAL WITH THEM. I'M GLAD WE HAVE GREAT STAFF TO HELP US OUT WITH THAT. THIS IS AN AREA, IN ADDITION TO THE SOUTH VIEW AREA THAT I'M PARTICULARLY CONCERNED ABOUT AND WANT TO SEE THE D.D.A. INVESTING IN BECAUSE RIGHT NOW, THE -- YOU KNOW, THE RESIDENTS THAT ARE SUPPORTING THOSE BUSINESSES, AND THE STATE STREET AREA AND THE SOUTH STREET AREA, ARE STUDENTS AND STUDENTS ARE ONLINE THROUGH THE SUMMER. YOU KNOW, WE KNOW THAT'S TRUE. SO IF THERE IS AN AREA OF THE DOWNTOWN WHERE I WANT THE D.D.A. TO BE WORKING KIND OF OVERTIME AND PLANNING TO HELP SUPPORT THESE BUSINESSES, STATE STREET WOULD BE INCLUDED IN THAT LIST AND CONSIDERING THAT MOST OF THESE ARE BELOW GROUND, CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS, I LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING IT.
02:17:21.041: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
02:17:23.477: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANKS, MR. MAYOR. JUST BRIEFLY. I APPRECIATE THAT COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER, NOTED THAT THE STATE STREET AREA ASSOCIATION WAS VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THIS PROJECT. THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN IN THE PIPELINE FOR MANY YEARS. SO I'M GLAD TO SEE IT COME FORWARD. AND I DO THINK THAT -- I WILL ALSO NOTE THAT THE UNIVERSITY IS VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THIS PROJECT. AND JUST OVER THE YEARS, ANECDOTALLY, INVOLVED WITH THE STREET ART FAIR FOR MANY, MANY YEARS AND NOW IN PREPARATION FOR THIS STREET ART FAIRS AND OBVIOUSLY STATE STREET HAS A MAJOR SECTION OF THE ART FAIR, THE ISSUE OF TRIP AND FALL HAZARDS IS A REAL CONCERN. AND WE OFTEN ARE SORT OF SCRAMBLING JUST BEFORE ONE OF THESE EVENTS TO -- TO ADDRESS -- MAKE SOME -- YOU KNOW, SOME TEMPORARY FIXES IF YOU WILL, AND SO IT'S NICE TO SEE THIS COME FORWARD, AND THE -- I ALSO THINK IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE TO DO THE DESIGN WORK FOR THE STREETSCAPE, THE REPLACEMENT AT AWN WOMEN TIME, AND THE SOFT SHARING, I THINK -- ALL AT ONE TIME, AND THE COST SHARING, I THINK MAKES SENSE. THE DESIGN COSTS ARE BASED ON THE CONSTRUCTION COST SHARING, AND WE'RE PAYING FOR THAT. WE THE CITY ARE PAYING FOR THE DESIGN, INCLUDING THE STAFF TIME AND THE D.D.A. SO OUR SHARE AT THIS POINT, IS JUST UNDER $440,000, THE D.D.A.'S IS ABOUT $360,000, AND SO I -- I THINK ALL THINGS CONSIDERED, IT SEEMS LIKE A VERY REASONABLE APPROACH AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING IT. THANK YOU.
02:19:15.890: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD?
02:19:16.991: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE TO POSTOWN PE THIS IN WILL JULY 6th, THAT IS THREE MONTHS WITH WE HAVE A BETTER GRASP ON THE FINANCIAL POSITION.
02:19:28.269: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE A SECOND? SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER NELSON. COUNCILMEMBER NELSON -- OR RATHER -- WELL, COUNCILWOMAN GRISWOLD, YOU STILL HAVE THE FLOOR.
02:19:40.948: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I HAVE NOTHING MORE TO ADD.
02:19:44.151: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER NELSON, DO YOU WANT TO TALK ON THE MAIN MOTION OR THIS OR CAN I START A NEW QUEUE ON THE --
02:19:48.622: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I CAN ACTUALLY TALK ON BOTH. I'M HAPPY TO TALK ON KATHY'S MOTION BECAUSE I ACTUALLY WANTED TO THANK HER FOR BRINGING IT UP, BECAUSE I -- I KNOW WHAT -- I HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT MY EMAILBOX LOOKS LIKE, AND THE KIND OF CONVERSATIONS THAT I'M HAVING WITH RESIDENTS AND I -- I DON'T KNOW THAT ANY OF THEM WANT US TO BE PARTICULARLY DISMISSIVE OF COVICOVID-19 AND I WOULD CERTAIY HOPE THAT MY COLLEAGUES WOULD NOT BE DISMISSIVE OF DISCUSSION AROUND THAT. SO FOR SOME OF THE MEMBERS OF COUNCIL WHO HAVE TRADITIONALLY URGED FISCAL CAUTION, I WILL SAY, I THINK THAT THE WHOLE TOWN IS CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT OUR FISCAL SITUATION WILL LOOK LIKE. I REALLY HOPE THAT RAISING THAT ISSUE IS NOT -- WELL, I GUESS I WILL JUST SAY THAT I -- I THINK THAT IT'S -- I THINK THAT IT WOULD BE A LITTLE FOOLHARDY FOR US TO PRETEND THAT THAT'S NOT SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT OR TO TALK ABOUT, OR CONSIDER. SO I'M HAPPY  TO HEAR WHAT OTHER PEOPLE HAVE TO SAY ABOUT COUNCILWOMAN GRISWOLD'S PRO E POSAL TO POST -- PROPOSAL TO THE POSTPONEMENT.
02:21:20.314: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
02:21:21.181: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING A POSTPONEMENT EVEN THOUGH I WAS CRITICAL OF THE D.D.A. I WILL PUSH BACK ON THE COLLEAGUE'S ASSERTION THAT WE SHOULD LOOK THROUGH A NEW SET OF LENS OF COVID-19. I WOULD BE FISCALLY IRRESPONSIBLE FOR US TO THINK THAT WE COULD CONTINUE BUSINESS AS NORMAL UNTIL WE ARE TOLD OTHERWISE. I HAVE BEEN TOLD BY -- I WILL TELL YOU, IF WE DO GO INTO RECESSION, IN FACT IF OUR GDP CONTRACTS AT 34% AS SOME SAY IT WILL, IT'S TECHNICALLY A DEPRESSION. SO -- IN EITHER CASE, A MAJOR RECESSION, OR A DEPRESSION, THESE ARE THE TYPE OF PROJECTS THAT GOVERNMENTS SHOULD TAKE ON AND SHOULD BE DOING DURING ECONOMIC DISPARITY, AND THE DEPRESSIONS. SO I'M NOT CONCERNED TO THAT EXTENT. I THINK HOPEFULLY WE COULD GET INCREASED FEDERAL DOLLARS FOR THESE TYPES OF PROGRAMS. THOUGH I DON'T -- I DON'T THINK IT'S TIME TO PAUSE BECAUSE OF THAT.
02:22:39.593: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, ACKERMAN, BANNISTER AND GRAND, PERHAPS WE CAN CALL IT A DAY ON POSTPONEMENT. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
02:22:48.736: >> Councilmember Lumm: I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING POSTPONEMENT. THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU JUST HAD TO SAY, COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI. I AGREE WITH MUCH OF WHAT YOU JUST SAID, AND I THINK WE ARE IN A DEPRESSION NOW. I MEAN, THE ECONOMY IS SHUT DOWN. BUT I THINK TO SOME ON THE FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE SIDE OF THE EQUATION, YOU HAVE TO BEAR IN MIND THAT WHEN WE DON'T MAINTAIN THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND THIS AREA IS RIDDLED WITH TRIP AND FALL HAZARDS. AND AS A MATTER, AGAIN, THE BOARD OF INSURANCE, WE HAVE SEEN CLAIMS THAT HAVE RESULTED FROM ACCIDENTS, INJURIES, IN THIS AREA. AND THIS PROJECT WOULD FIX THIS AREA, TO THE DEGREE THAT WE PUT OFF FOR MANY YEARS. SO I THINK WE CAN NO LONGER POSTPONE THIS PROJECT, AND IT WILL BENEFIT THE PROPERTY OWNERS, THE BUSINESSES, RESIDENTS, THE ENTIRE STATE STREET DISTRICT IMMEASURABLY. SO I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING POSTPONEMENT.
02:24:04.912: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN. ZACK >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I WON'T BE SUPPORTING THE POSTPONEMENT. I SEE THIS AS FAIRLY STRAIGHTFORWARD. WE HAVE AN INFRASTRUCTURE NEED AND CRUMBLING SIDEWALKS AND WE HAVE THE DOLLARS TO FIX THEM. AND WHEN I KNOCK ON DOORS OR LISTEN TO RESIDENTS OR READ EMAILS, ROAD, SIDE SIDEWALKS ANY ARE SAFETY IS THE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY. IF WE HAVE AUSTERE MEASURES, I HOPE IF ANYTHING TO INVEST IN OUR INFRASTRUCTURE, SO I DON'T SEE MY STANCE CHANGING, YOU KNOW, NO MATTER WHAT THE FINANCIAL FORECAST SO FAR. COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
02:24:48.488: >> Councilmember Bannister: WELL, I GUESS I HAD A QUESTION FOR STAFF THEN AGAIN ABOUT WHETHER WE SHOULD -- WHETHER THERE'S ANY MIDDLE GROUND BETWEEN YES, NO AND POSTPONE THREE MONTHS, LIKE, IF WE GO FORWARD TONIGHT, AND DON'T POSTPONE IT AND THEN WE WISHED WE HAD POSTPONED IT, CAN WE BACK OUT IF NEED BE?
02:25:16.516: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. CRAWFORD? MAMR. HUPY?
02:25:20.387: >> YOU CAN ALWAYS GO FORWARD WITH THE DESIGN AND THEN DECIDE WHETHER YOU ARE GOING TO EXECUTE THE CONSTRUCTION A AT A LATER DATE.
02:25:33.200: >> Councilmember Bannister: AND THAT DESIGN WORK COULD BE SAVED FOR WHENEVER WE COULD AFFORD IT?
02:25:41.041: >> IT WOULD HAVE SOME SHELF LIFE. THE LONGER YOU SAVE IT, THE -- THE LESS APPLICABLE IT WOULD BE IN THE FUTURE. AND ALSO, UNDERSTAND THAT PART OF THIS WORK IS RATIONALIZING THE WATER SYSTEM AND DOING STORMWATER WORK. AND SO YOU ARE ALWAYS AT RISK GOING FORWARD IF YOU DON'T DO THE WORK THAT EITHER YOU WILL HAVE A LARGE WATER MAIN BREAK OR ANOTHER LARGE RAIN EVENT.
02:26:17.344: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND?
02:26:20.547: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. I ALSO WON'T BE SUPPORTING POSTPONEMENT AND LIKE MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES, THIS IS PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD INFRASTRUCTURE. I WANT TO CLARIFY THAT I UNDERSTAND THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING THROUGH THIS AT A LENS, CERTAINLY NOT A HEALTH ECONOMIST. I'M THE ONLY PERSON AT THIS VIRTUAL TABLE THAT HAS A Ph.D. FROM THE SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH. SO I HAVE A PRETTY, YOU KNOW, SOLID UNDERSTAND OF DISEASE MODELS. SO I DON'T TAKE THIS LIGHTLY. WHAT I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE IS THAT WE ARE NOT USING IT AS AN EXCUSE NOT TO SUPPORT PROJECTS THAT WE WOULD OTHERWISE NOT SUPPORT ANYWAY AND JUST BE -- JUST BE HONEST WITH OURSELVES AND WHAT OUR VALUES ARE AND NOT USE IT AS A FALLBACK, BECAUSE I THINK THAT ACTUALLY DISCOUNTS THE SERIOUS NATURE OF THIS CRISIS THAT WE ARE IN AND, YOU KNOW, WE ALL DO KNOW AS SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES MENTIONED, THAT COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN DID. IF WE HAVE TO GO TO DIFFERENT AUSTERITY MEASURES, THEN WE WILL CROSS THAT BRIDGE WHEN WE GET TO IT, BUT RIGHT NOW WE DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION. AT THIS MEETING TONIGHT, I WILL CONTINUE TO STICK TO THE PRIORITIES THAT I HAVE AND THAT I HOPE THAT WE WILL -- THAT EVERYONE ELSE WILL AS WELL.
02:27:38.191: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE POSTPONEMENT. ROLL CALL VOTE STARTING WITH ME.
02:27:50.570: >> Mayor Taylor: NO.

02:28:14.528: >> Clerk Beaudry: THE MOTION FAILS.
02:28:17.364: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN MOTION? I'M DELIGHTED TO SUPPORT -- TO SUPPORT THIS, AS HAS BEEN STATED. WE HAVE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS IN THE DOWNTOWN. THEY INVOLVE THE -- THE REPLACEMENT AND OF BELOW GROUND INFRASTRUCTURE, THE ABOVE GROUND INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE OPTIMIZATION OF THAT INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE NEEDS OF OUR BUSINESS AND CONSUMER COMMUNITY. THIS WORK PERFORMED BY THE CITY, BY THE UNIVERSITY, AND THE DOWNTOWN DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY WILL ACHIEVE THAT GOAL. AND I WOULD LIKE TO, OF COURSE, MYSELF TO THANK THE D.D.A. THE D.D.A. HAS BEEN A SET OF -- HAS BEEN A STEWARD OF DOWNTOWN FOR YEARS. THE DOWNTOWN IS THE ENVY OF -- IS THE ENVY OF MANY. I'M PROUD OF IT. IT'S THERE FOR EVERYONE IN PART, BECAUSE OF THE GOOD WORK DONE BY THE D.D.A. FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING WITH ME.

02:29:49.222: >> Mayor Taylor: LET'S ROLL WITH THIS PUBLIC HEARING IN CASE THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN SITTING AROUND WAITING FOR IT AND THEN A BREAK. WE NOW COME TO A PUBLIC HEARING, IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO SPEAK TO COUNCIL AND THE COMMUNITY ABOUT A SPECIFIC ITEM ON THE AAGENDA. THE SPECIFIC SUBJECT OF THE PUBLIC HEARING.

COUNCIL DOES NOT RESPOND DIRECTLY TO PUBLIC COMMENT. IS THERE ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING?
02:31:23.383: >> Councilmember Ackerman: MAYOR?
02:31:27.354: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
02:31:28.255: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THIS IS LIKELY TO BE POSTPONED BECAUSE THIS WAS IMPROPERLY NOTICED GIVEN THE ONLINE NATURE.
02:31:34.828: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
02:31:36.263: >> Councilmember Nelson: MAYOR, DID I MISS IT? DID YOU READ THE TITLE?
02:31:40.100: >> Mayor Taylor: I DID NOT. NO I WAS -- I WAS ASKEW AND WAS SO FOCUSED ON THE COMMENTARY THAT I DIDN'T READ THE PUBLIC HEARING. THANK YOU. LET'S TRY THIS AGAIN.

02:32:34.454: >> YES, THIS IS EDWARD VILAAMETTI. I WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY IN ZONING IN CASES WHERE OTHERWISE PARCELS WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT TO DEVELOP. AND WITH THAT, I LEAVE YOU ALL. THANK YOU FOR HOSTING THIS MEETING. I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS MAY BE POSTPONED TO THE NEXT MEETING.
02:32:52.038: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.

A-1, WE HAVE BEFORE US THE REGULAR SESSION -- PARDON ME THE SPECIAL AND REGULAR SESSION MEETING MINUTES OF FEBRUARY 24 AND MARCH 16, 2020, MAY I HAVE A MOTION TO APPROVE THESE MINUTES? MOVED BY ACKERMAN AND SMITH. ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] THE MINTHE MINUTES ARE APPROVEDN ORDINANCE TO AMEND CHAPTER 55 ANN ARBOR UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE REZONING OF .6 ACRES FROM C2B BUSINESS SERVICE DISTRICT TO C3 FRANK SPECIAL DISTRICT, MSGCU REZONING. 2151 WEST STADIUM BOULEVARD. MR. ACKERMAN.
02:42:11.931: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  I WILL MOVE TO POSTPONE IT UNTIL APRIL 20th.
02:42:17.203: >> Mayor Taylor: SECONDED BY? COUNCILMAN RAMLAWI. DISCUSSION OF THE POSTPONEMENT? ALL IN FAVOR OF THE POSTPONEMENT? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT IS POSTPONED. C-1, AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND CHAPTER 55 ZONING REZONING OF .Y CONVENIENCE CENTER DISTRICT TO PUD PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT, THE GARNET PUD ZONING AND SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS 325 EAST SUMMIT STREET, MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER. DISCUSSION, PLEASE OF C1, COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
02:42:56.075: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR AND THANK YOU TO RESIDENTS WHO HAVE WRITTEN ON THIS ISSUE TO THE DEVELOPER FOR YOUR PATIENCE THROUGH THIS PROCESS. AND TO STAFF FOR YOUR THOROUGH WORK TO ENSURE THAT THE LETTER OF THE LAW IS APPLIED IN EVERY CASE. THIS IS A WEIRD, BIZARRE SCENARIO IN WHICH A PROPOSAL THAT, YOU KNOW, RESIDENTS LIKED THAT MANY MEMBERS OF COUNCIL LIKED THAT REWILL SPECTED THE HISTORIC NATURE OF ITS CONTEXT, CLEANED UP $300,000 WORTH OF POLLUTION ON SITE, AND PROVIDED SOME ADDED HOUSING TO THE KERRYTOWN NEIGHBORHOOD IN A GREEN AND SUSTAINABLE MANNER. WHAT WAS NOT APPROVED BASED ON -- ON PREFERENCES AROUND ZONING, IT HAS SINCE BEEN BROUGHT BACK BY A PUD, AS THEIR PREFERRED OPTION. UNFORTUNATELY, IN REVIEW OF THE PUD ORDINANCE, IT'S CLEAR THAT OUR LAW LAYS OUT THE FACT THAT -- WELL, TWO PRIMARY DRAWBACKS OF USING PUD IN THIS CASE. THE FIRST THAT, PUD CAN ONLY BE IMPLEMENTED IF NO OTHER ZONING CODE CAN BE APPLIED EFFECTIVELY. AND UNFORTUNATELY, BECAUSE THIS PROPOSAL WENT THROUGH THE ENTIRE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS UNDER ANOTHER ZONING DESIGNATION, IT WAS PROVEN THAT IT COULD BE MET UNDER A DIFFERENT ZONING DISTICKET. THE SECOND IS WE UPDATED ALL OF OUR REQUIREMENTS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING PAVEMENT IN LIEU. IF YOU ARE GOING TO PROPOSE RESIDENTIAL HOUSING, ABOVE WHAT THE CURRENT ZONING ALLOWS, YOU HAVE TO EITHER INCLUDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN YOUR DEVELOPMENT AS A PUD OR YOU HAVE TO MAKE A CASH CONTRIBUTION TO OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUND. THE SUM NOW REQUIRED BY THE FORMULA IS ABOUT $300,000 AND YOU THE ONSET OF THIS -- THIS PETITION BEING SUBMITTED, THE EQUATION WOULD HAVE COME CLOSER TO $88,000. THE DEVELOPER CAN AFFORD TO PAY THE $88,000. THE PROJECT IS NOT VIABLE AT THE $300,000 LEVEL. THERE ARE A COUPLE OF CONFLUENCING FACTORS THAT HAVE LED STAFF TO RECOMMEND DENIAL, WHICH I JUST STATED. THEY DID SEE IT APPROPRIATE TO RECOMMEND APPROVAL, AND ULTIMATELY, A REZONING IS AT THE DISTRICTION OF CITY COUNCIL. SO I WILL SOME FLEXIBILITY. I WILL REMIND COLLEAGUES THAT I THINK THIS WAS ON THE SUBSTANCE OF THE DEVELOPMENT SOME OPTIMISM AND ENCOURAGEMENT ABOUT IT, ITS FORM AND FUNCTION, JUST A DISLIKE OF THE ZONING CODE BEING APPLIED. I THINK THERE'S ONE IMPORTANT HICCUP THAT I NEED CLARIFIED, WHICH IS THE AMOUNT OF CONTRIBUTION TO THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUND. YOU KNOW, WE COULD VOTE IN FAVOR OF THIS SEASON AND THE BILL APPLIED WOULD BE $300,000, THE DEVELOPER HAS SAID THE PROJECT IS NONVIABLE AT THAT AMOUNT AND WOULD NOT GO FORWARD WITH IT, EVEN GIVEN THE ENTITLEMENTS THROUGH THIS PROCESS. SO LOOKING TO MR. LENART OR MR. McDONALD OR MR. POSTEMA, IS THERE A LITTLE MEANS BY WHICH WE CAN REDUCE THE AMOUNT THE DEVELOPER TO CONTRIBUTE INTO THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUND?
02:46:33.692: >> GOOD EVENING, MAYOR AND COUNCIL, BRENT LENART, THE PLANNING MANAGER. THROUGH THE ORDINANCE, THERE IS NOT, IF COUNCIL WERE INTERESTED IN RECONSIDERING THE FORMULA CALCULATION AS LAID OUT IN ORDINANCE, THE ORDINANCE MEASURES COULD BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION. THE RECENT FORMULA COULD BE RECONSIDERED BUT IN SHORT TO COMPLY WITH THE PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT, THERE'S NO CHANGE THAT COULD HAPPEN SORT OF AT THE TABLE AT THIS PETITION.
02:47:13.732: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU. SO IF WE VOTE YES TONIGHT, WE WOULD -- WE COULD CHARGE CLOSER TO THE $300,000?
02:47:27.947: >> THAT'S CORRECT.
02:47:28.447: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU.
02:47:32.051: >> MAYOR?
02:47:32.751: >> Clerk Beaudry: MAYOR, THE PETITIONER IS ON THE PHONE IF ANYONE IS INTERESTED IN SPEAKING TO HIM.
02:47:38.891: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN, ARE YOU THROUGH?
02:47:40.993: >> Councilmember Ackerman: FOR ROUND ONE, YES, I'M THROUGH.
02:47:45.631: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
02:47:47.032: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU FOR THAT HELPFUL SUMARARRY. I'M GLAD TO SEE THE PROJECT BACK WITH WHAT IS IN MY VIEW THE APPROPRIATE ZONING PROPOSED, WHICH IS A PUD RATHER THAN THE C1A CAMPUS BUSINESS DISTRICT ZONING. AND YOU WILL RECALL THAT WHEN THE CAMPUS DISTRICT WAS REJECTED IN SEPTEMBER, THERE WAS A LOT OF SUPPORT FOR THE PROJECT ITSELF. WE HEARD FROM THE OLD 4th WARD THAT THEY UNANIMOUSLY SUPPORTED THE PROJECT. CITY STAFF, RECOMMENDED DENIAL OF THE PUD ZONING BUT THE PLANNING COMMISSION DIDN'T AGREE AND SUPPORTED THE PUD ZONING PROPOSAL. I BELIEVE THAT THE PLANNING COMMISSION'S DECISION WAS APPROPRIATE AND THAT THERE ARE SUFFICIENT PUBLIC BENEFITS TO MEET THE PUD STANDARD. THE PROJECT ADDS TO OUR HOUSING STOCK AND ALTHOUGH, IT'S NOT AFFORDABLE HOUSING, THERE IS A PAVEMENT  IN LIEU CONTRIBUTION O THE AFFORDABLE PROJECT. IT'S FUNDED COMPLETELY BY THE DEVELOPER. NO PUBLIC OR BROWNFIELD FUNDS ARE REQUESTED AND IT INCLUDES A STORMWATER MANAGEMENT FUND THAT OTHERWISE WOULD NOT EXIST AND ALL OF THESE ARE PROJECT BENEFITS AND IT PRO PROVIDES A N ROOF AND PARKING. 4 I'M HOPEFUL IT CAN BE WORKED OUT BETWEEN TONIGHT'S VOTE AND WHEN IT COMES BACK FOR THE SECOND READING AND THAT WOULD BE WHEN THE SITE PLAN IS HERE. I WOULD BE SUPPORTIVE OF THIS AT FIRST READING AND I'M HOPEFUL WE ARE ABLE TO MOVE THIS PROJECT FORWARD AND WE DO NEED TO ADDRESS THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING ISSUE. THANK YOU.
02:49:44.717: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNSEL MEMBER EATON? -- COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
02:49:49.855: >> Councilmember Eaton: I ALSO WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS. I UNDERSTAND THAT SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT THIS PROJECT COULD HAVE GONE FORWARD AS A C1A PROJECT. I BELIEVE THAT THERE'S A GOOD ARGUMENT THAT THIS SITE WAS NOT APPROPRIATE FOR C1A. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THAT ZONING WAS VIABLE, WHICH MAKES A PUD APPROPRIATE. I HAVE BEEN EXCHANGING EMAILS WITH THE CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. I CAN'T REVEAL ANYTHING BUT WITH REGARD TO THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING PAYMENT, AND I THINK THAT WE -- WE SHOULD WORK ON THAT BETWEEN THIS MEETING AND THE PUBLIC HEARING AND THE SITE PLAN. SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS TONIGHT IN FIRST READING AND I HOPE THAT EVERYBODY ELSE WILL.
02:50:41.106: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
02:50:43.642: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. YES, COUNCILMAN ACKERMAN SAID, REZONING IS COMPLETELY AT THE DISCRETION OF CITY COUNCIL. I DIDN'T SEE ANY REASON OF THIS PASSED AND NOT BE A C1A TYPE SITE THAT WOULD BE FULLY USED WITH THE ZOO ERR ROW COMMERCIAL ASPECT TO IT. I THINK IT WAS ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE THAT WE REJECTED THAT. NOW, I -- THIS IS NOT THE KIND OF BUILDING THAT I LIKE TO SEE BUILT. AS PEOPLE KNOW, I HAVE BEEN CLEAR SINCE WE ARE DETERMINED A CLIMATE N ZERO. I WOULD SUPPORT THE REZONING OF THIS BECAUSE I THINK PUD IS A MUCH BETTER ZONING FOR THIS SITE THAN C1AR OR C1A AS IT EXISTS NOW. TO MOVE IT AWAY FROM ITS CURRENT ZONING. I THINK THIS SHOULD BE BUSINESS AND MIXED USE ON THIS SITE. WE WERE ABOUT TO DISCUSS THE NEED FOR MIXED USE AND ALL OVER THE COMMUNITY, ESPECIALLY IN TRANSIT AREAS, AND IT DOESN'T GET MUCH MORE TRANSIT THAN ACROSS THE STREET FROM A TRAIN STATION. I FIND IT DIFFICULT TO DECIDE IF PUD, WHEN WE MAY CONSIDER THIS IS A TRANSIT-ORIENTED SITE. AND THERE'S ZERO MIXED USE WHICH IS NOT WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR. MORE TO MY ORIGINAL POINT, MY BIGGEST CONCERN IS WITH THE BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS RESOLUTION. IF YOU LOOK AT THAT LIST OF BENBENEFITS DATED MARCH 11th. SOME OF THOSE ARE NOT REALLY BENEFITS OR PUD-TYPE BENEFITS. I THINK IT'S A STRETCH TO SAY THAT DENSITY OF THE PROPOSAL IS A PUBLIC BENEFIT SINCE MORE HOUSING IS BEING PROPOSED. YEAH, IT'S MORE HOUSING. WE NEED MORE HOUSING. IS THAT EVER CONSIDERED A BENEFIT FOR PUD? AND SO I'M NOT SURE THAT THE LOCATIONS, AS THIS PROJECT PUTS NEW CITY RESIDENTS CLOSE TO JOB SHOP AND PUBLIC, AND OTHER AMENITIES. I DON'T THINK THAT THOSE ARE ACTUALLY OVER ENUMERATED PUD BENEFITS UNDER THE ZONING REGS. I'M CONCERNED ABOUT LEAVING THAT IN THERE AND SETTING A PRECEDENT THAT SOMEONE ELSE CAN CLAIM THAT, THAT JUST MERELY ADDING PUD. I THINK PUD IS ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE FOR THIS SITE, BUT I DON'T -- I'M WEARY OF ADOPTING THIS WHOLESALE WITH THIS LIST OF SOME BENEFITS AND SOME THAT I DON'T CONSIDER BENEFITS. AND THE IDEA THAT IS THERE IS AN INSTALLATION OF A BARRIER, THAT WOULD BE DONE WITH ANY TYPE OF CONSTRUCTION ON THIS SITE. BEFORE THEY BUILD, THAT HAS TO HAPPEN. BEFORE ANYONE BUILDS THAT HAS TO HAPPEN. I JUST -- MY BIG CONCERNS WITH THEPUD ARE THIS LIST OF I NUMERATED BENEFITS, SOME OF WHICH ARE ACTUAL BENEFITS LIKE THE GREEN ROOF AND THE ADDITIONAL BIKE PARKING AND THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CONTRIBUTION AND SOME OF WHICH THAT I DON'T FEEL ARE GENUINE PUD BENEFITS. I WILL SUPPORT THE CURRENT REZONING TO GET IT OUT OF WHERE IT IS NOW.
02:54:00.372: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER NELSON?
02:54:01.239: >> Councilmember Nelson: SORRY, IT TAKES ME A MINUTE TO UNMUTE. I HAVE A QUESTION. I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S FOR PETITIONERS OR FOR MR. LENART. THE PLAN -- THE SITE PLAN SUBMITTED IN SEPTEMBER AND THE SITE PLAN SUBMITTED IN NOVEMBER, WHAT WERE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THOSE SITE PLANS? WERE THEY DIFFERENT?
02:54:30.335: >> I DON'T BELIEVE THEY WERE DIFFERENT. I WILL HAVE JILL FARBER WEIGH?
02:54:35.574: >> HI, COUNCILMEMBERS. THERE ARE NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES SINCE THE SEPTEMBER PETITION WAS LAST REVIEWED BY YOU GUYS.
02:54:44.549: >> Councilmember Nelson: OKAY. ALL RIGHT. THEN I -- THEN IT MAKES LOGICAL SENSE TO ME THAT THE CITY RECEIVED THIS SITE PLAN, IN SEPTEMBER. THE SITE PLAN WAS RECEIVED IN SEPTEMBER. WE HAD A DISAGREEMENT ABOUT THE ZONING, BUT THE SITE PLAN WAS RECEIVED IN SEPTEMBER BECAUSE WE HAVE -- YOU JUST SAID THAT IT'S THE SAME. SO YEAH, WE EXCHANGED EMAILS WITH OUR COUNCIL. THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THAT. THAT ANSWERS MY QUESTION. THANKS.
02:55:36.902: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
02:55:38.537: >> Councilmember Bannister: SINCE THE PETITIONERS ON THE PHONE, THEY SENT SOME LENGTHY EMAILS LATE TODAY AND I WANTED TO GIVE THEM A CHANCE TO EXPLAIN WHAT IS HAPPENING FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE.
02:55:53.685: >> YES, WE JUST REITERATED THE POINTS THAT WERE MADE AT THE CITY PLANNING COMMISSION, ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE PROCESS THAT WE HAVE BEEN UNDERTAKING IN ORDER TO DO THE MANY COUNCILMEMBERS ASKED US TO DO, WHICH IS TO BRING THE PROJECT BACK UNALTERED BUT IN A DIFFERENT ZONING HAS BEEN ONGOING SINCE THE END OF AUGUST WHEN WE ESTABLISHED HOW THAT COULD BE ACCOMPLISHED AND WE HAVE BEEN DOING THAT CONTINUOUSLY UNINTERRUPTED. SO WE FEEL WE HAVE BEEN DOING EXACTLY WHAT WE HAVE BEEN ASKED IN A TIMELY FASHION.
02:56:33.925: >> Councilmember Ackerman: MR. MOORE, WOULD YOU INTRODUCE YOURSELF FOR THE BENEFIT OF PUBLIC. SORRY TO INTERRUPT.
02:56:38.396: >> MY NAME IS BRAD MOORE, I'M THE ARCHITECT FOR THE PROJECT.
02:56:51.676: >> Councilmember Bannister: IF I STILL HAVE THE FLOOR.
02:56:54.146: >> Mayor Taylor: YOU DO.
02:56:54.679: >> Councilmember Bannister: IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING ELSE TO ADD, I DO HAVE A BIG PROBLEM WITH -- I AGREE WITH COUNCILMEMBER NELSON THAT IF THEY SUBMITTED IT IN SEPTEMBER, AND IT'S NOT CHANGED AND WE HAVE BEEN WORKING SINCE AUGUST, THIS IS JUST REALLY BAD FOR LOCAL DEVELOPERS TO LOCAL, MODEST SIZED DEVELOPERS IF OUR SYSTEM IS NOT GEARED TOWARDS HELPING THEM EFFICIENTLY BUILD GOOD PROJECTS, THEN WE HAVE GOT A BIG PROBLEM AND SO -- AND I HAVE BEEN HEARING THAT FROM -- THIS IS NOT JUST THE ONLY PROJECT THAT HAS HAD BIG PROBLEMS, WORKING, AND HAVING MEETINGS FOR YEARS TO REACH A BRICK WALL LIKE THIS. SO YES, I WILL SUPPORT THE REZONING AND THOSE SUGGESTIONS THAT BRETT LENART SUGGESTED WE MAY HAVE TO REDO SOME MAJOR ORDINANCES, I GUESS WHAT WOULD BE OUR PROCESS? WOULD WE START WORKING ON THAT IMMEDIATELY OR WHAT IS OUR NEXT STEP TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM?
02:58:21.700: >> THOSE ARE CHANGES THAT ARE CURRENTLY CONTEMPLATED. IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S DESIRED, IT COULD BE INTRODUCED BY COUNCIL TO DIRECT BOTH THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR, VIA STAFF, AND THE PLANNING COMMISSION TO DELIVER ANY PROPOSED CHANGES IN THAT REGARD. I ONLY ASK THAT YOU IDENTIFY SORT OF WHAT THE GOALS ARE THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO ACHIEVE SO THAT WE HAVE THE BEST CASE OPPORTUNITY TO DELIVER BACK TO THE CITY COUNCIL THE POLICY ORDINANCE CHANGES THAT YOU DESIRE.
02:58:56.868: >> Councilmember Bannister: AND THE SEPTEMBER SUBMISSION WAS NOT GRANDFATHERED. IN WASN'T IT 616 WASHINGTON THAT WE SAID, OH, WE COULDN'T SUBMIT THEM TO THE NEW PREMIUMS?
02:59:10.548: >> YEAH, WHEN THEY WERE CHANGES MADE TO THE UDC AND A VARIETY OF SECTIONS, SPECIFICALLY A COUPLE OF PROJECTS HAD BEEN SUBMITTED AND WERE UNDER TECHNICAL REVIEW AT THAT TIME. SO IN THE ADOPTION OF THAT, THAT WAS RAISED BY BOTH THE PLANNING COMMISSION AND THE CITY COUNCIL AS HOW -- WHAT WOULD BE THE CORRECT WAY TO APPLY THE REGULATIONS TO THOSE PROJECTS THAT WERE UNDER REVIEW. SO THAT MANIFESTED IN LANGUAGE AND THAT ADOPTION THAT SAID ANY APPLICATIONS THAT WERE CURRENTLY UNDER REVIEW, AT THE TIME OF PUBCATION, WHICH IN THAT -- PUBLICATION, WHICH AT THAT TIME WAS MAY 2nd WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE PREVIOUS ORDINANCE, THE PUD REZONING APPLICATION IN THIS CASE CAME IN AFTER THAT DATE. THAT'S WHERE THE STAFF FINDING COMES FROM.
03:00:02.033: >> Councilmember Bannister: HAVE YOU HAD A CHANCE TO DISCUSS THAT WITH THE ATTORNEY'S OFFICE AND --
03:00:06.838: >> YES, AND I'M HAPPY TO DISCUSS FURTHER.
03:00:13.979: >> Mayor Taylor: WHEN YOU SAY DISCUSS FURTHER TO DISCUSS FURTHER FROM THE ATTORNEYS, BUT NOT DISCUSS WHAT THE ATTORNEYS HAD TO SAY IN OPEN SESSION?
03:00:22.520: >> IF THIS MOVES FORWARD ON FIRST READING AND THAT I WILL CERTAINLY TAKE STEPS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE LOOKED AT ALL ASPECTS OF THAT. I HAVE -- I HAVE LOOKED AT IT. WE DON'T COME TO THIS RECOMMENDATION LIGHTLY. WE KNOW IT'S AI SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON -- A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THIS PROJECT AND WE WILL UNCOVER EVERY POSSIBLE STONE BEFORE THE NEXT MEETING.
03:00:54.219: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
03:00:55.353: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I APPRECIATE THE PETITIONER'S PERSISTENCE ON THIS. A LOT OF WORK FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF .5 OF AN ACRE OF LAND. WE TALKED LAST YEAR ABOUT OBVIOUSLY THIS PROJECT AND THIS YEAR, THE PETITIONS FOLLOWED THROUGH WITH THE DIRECTION OF COUNCIL TO COME BACK UNDER A PUD. WHAT WAS THE CONTRIBUTION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING ON THE FIRST ATTEMPT. WHAT WERE WE LOOKING AT THEN VERSUS NOW.
03:01:38.263: >> NO CONTRIBUTION WOULD BE REQUIRED UNDER THE PREVIOUS PETITION. THE PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE REQUIRES THAT WHEN YOU ARE SEEKING A DEVELOPMENT DENSITY ABOVE WHAT THE CURRENT ZONING IS, THAT'S WHERE A CALCULATION COMES INTO MAY. -- PLAY. THEY WERE REZONING FROM ONE DISTRICT TO ANOTHER DISTRICT AND THERE WOULD BE NO REQUIREMENT FOR THAT CALCULATION.
03:02:03.221: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  SO IN THE PRIOR ITERATION, WE DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING IN TERMS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING OR CONTRIBUTION TO THE FUND, BUT -- SO, YOU KNOW, I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS. I HOPE MY COLLEAGUES WILL TOO. I THINK WE PUT THESE FOLKS TO THE STAFF AND STAFF TO THE TEST AND HOPEFULLY THIS CAN MOVE ALONG AND WE CAN GET TO THE NEXT ORDER OF BUSINESS.
03:02:33.551: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
03:02:34.986: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I GUESS, I WILL BE SEEKING SOME MORE ADVICE FROM OUR ATTORNEY AND MR. LENART. MY UNDERSTANDING WAS THAT A -- THE PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT, WHEN IT COMES TO LIKE WHEN WE APPROVE A SITE PLAN UNDER PUD, THAT THAT'S AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE CITY AND THE DEVELOPER TO BUILD A CERTAIN WAY. I DON'T KNOW WHY WE CAN'T HAVE AN AGREEMENT THAT IN SOME ASPECT THEY WERE IN THE PIPELINE AND SOMETIMES THEY WEREN'T. I DON'T WANT TO SET US UP FOR INCONSISTENT PRACTICES WITH DEVELOPERS OR ANY TYPE OF ACCUSATION OF SPOT ZONING OR FAVORITISM, I GUESS I NEED A BETTER DEFINITION UNDER THE LAW OF WHAT A PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT IS, IN ORDER TO STRIKE A DEAL WITH THIS PERSON OR THIS DEVELOPER, TO SAY, WE WANT THIS REZONING, BECAUSE IT'S PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT. YOU WERE HALF IN OR HALF OUT OF THE PIPELINE, WHATEVER IS DETERMINED BY THE ATTORNEY. IS IT NOT SO THAT WE CAN JUST CUT A DEAL BECAUSE IT'S A PUD-TYPE ZONING ON THE SITE PLAN OR IS THAT COMPLETE A A MISUNDERSTANDING?
03:03:52.030: >> YEAH, SO WHEN -- INVESTIGATING OTHER -- I'M HAPPY TO PROVIDE MORE BACKGROUND ON THAT, BUT THE SHORT ANSWER IS THAT OVER HISTORY, THE CITY HAS TAKEN DELIBERATE STEPS TO PUT IN SOME POINTS OF ENTRY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT. SOME OTHER COMMUNITIES MIGHT HAVE A PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE THAT IS MUCH MORE FLEXIBLE, BUT WE HAVE SAID IN ORDER TO HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE, YOU HAVE TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS. SO TO -- FOR THE CITY TO CAPITULATE ON SOME OF THOSE ENTRY REQUIREMENTS ON THE PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT WOULD NOT BE FOLLOWING OUR OWN ORDINANCE TO SAY HOW WE CONSIDERED THOSE. BUT I TAKE YOUR POINT AND I THINK WE CAN DO A BETTER JOB OF EXPLAINING THAT SO YOU HAVE THAT RESOURCE.
03:04:55.293: >> Councilmember Hayner:  AND IT'S ALSO THE CASE WHEN WE CREATED THIS PREMIUM, THAT IF A PROJECT WANTS TO USE THIS PREMIUM TO INCREASE THEIR FLOOR RATIO AND SO ON AND ACCEPT THE PREMIUM, THAT THEY HAVE TO MAKE A FORMULATED CONTRIBUTION OR AN AMOUNT OF UNITS BUILT IN THE PROJECT AND SO ON? AND THEY HAD OPTED FULLY FOR FINANCIAL VIABILITY TO GO WITH THE CONTRIBUTION IN THE PREVIOUS -- OR WOULD HAVE GONE WITH THE CONTRIBUTION UNDER THE PREVIOUS PUD FAR CALCULATIONS, CORRECT? BUT UNDER THIS ONE, IT'S JUST TOO MUCH? THEY FEEL IT DOESN'T MAKE THE PROJECT VIABLE, RIGHT?
03:05:33.765: >> YEAH, THE -- I DON'T HAVE THAT NOW WHAT THE CONTRIBUTION WOULD HAVE REQUIRED UNDER THE OLD PUD ORDINANCE, BUT WE CAN WORK TO PROVIDE THAT AS AI COMPARISON POINT AS WELL.
03:05:46.477: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I THINK ANN TOLD ME IT WAS $80,000 VERSUS THIS $380,000. BUT WE CAN DO A MIX OF THOSE TWO UNDER THE CURRENT OR THE OLD LAW; IS THAT CORRECT?
03:05:59.123: >> YEAH, UNDER BOTH -- THAT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT CHANGED IN THE PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT LANGUAGE. YOU ALWAYS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET THAT REQUIREMENT BY EITHER PROVIDING A CONTRIBUTION, PROVIDING UNITS TO THE NECESSARY PORTION OF THE SITE OR SOME COMBINATION THEREOF.
03:06:16.641: >> Councilmember Hayner: OKAY. I'M A FAN OF SEEING BUILT UNITS AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE US TO LOOK FOR A WAY TO WORK OUT SOME COMBINATION THAT WOULD WORK FOR THE DEVELOPER ALSO TO GET THESE CONTRIBUTIONS OR BUILT UNITS IN HAND. WE ALL KNOW WE NEED THEM. SO THANK YOU FOR ANSWERING THAT.
03:06:33.925: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER NELSON?
03:06:44.502: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I WAS IN THE QUEUE? I WAS IN THE QUEUE? I FORGOT WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY, ACTUALLY. I THINK I WAS GOING TO SAY THAT I WAS CURIOUS IF WE COULD JUST DIRECT STAFF FOR THE $80,000 CONTRIBUTION, VERSUS THE 380 SOME. I THINK WE WILL BE TALKING THROUGH THAT LATER.
03:07:13.464: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND?
03:07:14.866: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. THIS WHOLE PROCESS, JUST HONESTLY BREAKS MY HEART. LIKE EVERYONE LIKED THIS PROJECT AND I FELT LIKE, YOU KNOW, AS A GROUP, THIS COUNCIL ASKED FOR A PUD AND THE EV THE DEVELOPER COK WITH A PUD AND NOW WE TAKE A STEP BACKWARD. I THINK THIS IS A LESSON THAT PUD IS NOT THE ANSWER IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE ZONING. IT ADDS SO MUCH TO THE COST OF A PROJECT THAT I THINK THERE REALLY HAS TO BE A GOOD REASON TO GO PUD AND NOT JUST WE LIKE THE PROJECT BUT WE DON'T LIKE THE ZONING. BECAUSE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT AFFORDABILITY OF HOUSING, TAKING ALL OF THIS TIME TO COME BACK, I THINK WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE OUR OWN CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE COST OF HOUSING WHEN WE DRAG A PROCESS OUT LIKE THIS. SO I'M GOING TO VOTE TO SUPPORT THIS IN HOPES THAT WE CAN COME BACK AT THE NEXT TIME WITH IT, WITH A SOLUTION THAT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING TO ENJEST. AND IT HAS A SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT OF DOING ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE PASSED.
03:08:51.863: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING WITH ME.
03:09:03.774: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
03:09:07.578: >> Councilmember Eaton: YES.
03:09:08.179: >> Councilmember Nelson:  YES.
03:09:12.850: >> Councilmember Smith: YES.
03:09:13.451: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES.
03:09:15.553: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES.
03:09:17.555: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES.
03:09:20.057: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES.
03:09:25.530: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES.
03:09:26.597: >> Councilmember Grand: YES.
03:09:27.198: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES.
03:09:28.833: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION CARRIES.
03:09:31.636: >> Mayor Taylor: C-2 AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND CHAPTER 112 NONDISCRIMINATION, SECTIONS 9:150, 9:151, 9:152, 9:156 AND 9:157, TITLE IX OF THE CODE OF THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR TO CLARIFY EFINITION OF SOURCE OF INCOMEIFY AND ADD ETHNICITY AS A PROTECTED CLASS, AND ADD AN EXCEPTION ALLOWING DISCOUNTS FOR VETERANS. MOVED BY GRAND AND SECONDED BY THEY WILLSON. DISCUSSION OF -- BY NELSON. DISCUSSION OF C-2. COUNCIL GRAND.
03:10:08.105: >> Councilmember Grand: THIS IS A FIRST READING. A LOT OF DISCUSSION, BUT DO YOU WANT TO RECOGNIZE WHILE COUNCILMEMBER NELSON AND I ARE BRINGING THIS FORWARD, I THINK THE CREDIT REALLY GOES TO THE MEMBERS OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION, TO JENNIFER HALL AT THE HOUSING COMMISSION, WHO GAVE A LOT OF INPUT INTO THIS ORDINANCE, AS WELL AS MARGARET RADABAUGH FROM THE CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. I THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT STEP AS WE GO FORWARD, ESPECIALLY WITH ALL CONCERNS THAT WE ALREADY HAD ABOUT HOUSING AND NEW CONCERNS ABOUT HOUSING INSTABILITY. SOME OF THIS IS JUST CLEANUP OF LANGUAGE AND DEFINITIONS BUT THE MAIN MOTIVATION FOR THIS IN ORDINANCE CHANGE WILL PREVENT DISCRIMINATION. AND I HOPE YOU WILL SUPPORT IT.
03:11:06.063: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
03:11:08.499: >> Councilmember Eaton: I WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A COSPONSOR, PLEASE. THAT'S ALL.
03:11:12.403: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED AND GOES ON TO A SECOND READING. I GUESS I'M CLEAR AS TO WHERE WE PUT OUR CLOSED SESSION.
03:11:36.093: >> Councilmember Lumm: I THINK IT'S AFTER DC-2.
03:11:41.132: >> DC-3.
03:11:41.399: >> Mayor Taylor: IT'S AFTER DC-3. DC-1, RESOLUTION TO APPOINT TOM CRAWFORD TO THE DOWNTOWN DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY. MOVED AND SECONDED. DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
03:11:52.209: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THAT WAS ON OUR LAST AGENDA, WHEN WE DIDN'T HAVE EIGHT VOTES PRESENT TO APPOINT TOM CRAWFORD TO THE DOWNTOWN DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PER OUR STATUTE AND PRACTICE. WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO APPOINT MR. CRAWFORD TO THE DOWNTOWN DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY, AND I THINK IT'S EXTREMELY CRITICAL AND, IN FACT, BENEFICIAL TO A GREAT EXTENT, MORE THAN USUAL TO HAVE SOMEONE IN MR. CRAWFORD'S CAPACITY AT THIS TIME, FOR A SEAT AT THAT TABLE. I'M CONCERNED JUST WITH SOME OF THE CONVERSATIONS I LISTENED INTO ON, THE -- WE NEED A SEAT AT THE TABLE. I DON'T BELIEVE CITY COUNCIL HAS A SEAT AT THE TABLE AT AN IMPORTANT TIME AND THE DDA'S ENVIRONMENT KNEWS ARE ENORM -- REVENUES ARE ENORMOUS. THEY HAVE DISCRETION, UNLIKE MUCH MORE DISCRETION ON HOW THAT MONEY IS SPENT THAN PEOPLE CAN IING MAIN, AND I THINK IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW TO HAVE SOMEBODY WITH THE ACUMEN OF MR. CRAWFORD HELPING THOSE CONVERSATIONS BECAUSE THEY HAVE SUCH A HUGE CONSEQUENCE ON OUR ABILITY FOR POLICY AT THE CITY LEVEL HERE. I AM, FOR ONE, LOOKING FOR GREATER COLLABORATION AND OVERSIGHT AS WE GO FORWARD.
03:13:39.784: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] ALL OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. DC-3, RESOLUTION DIRECTING THE PLANNING COMMISSION TO CREATE A TRANSIT SUPPORTED DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT. MOVED BY ACKERMAN AND SECONDED BY SMITH. DISCUSSION OF DC-2, COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
03:14:03.974: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU. IT'S BEEN FUN TO WATCH US FOR THE "BRADY BUNCH." FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE TOO YOUNG, IT'S A SHOW FROM THE '60s. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK EVERYONE WHO WROTE IN, WE GOT NEARLY 100 EMAILS IN SUPPORT OF THIS. I WAS REALLY GLAD TO LEARN BOTH THE SIERRA CLUB AND THE WASHTENAW HOUSING ALLIANCE SUPPORTED THIS AND THANKS FOR THE HANDFUL WHO RAISED CONCERNS. AT THIS POINT, I DON'T THINK IT'S AI SURPRISE, I GREW UP HERE IN ANN ARBOR. I'M A PROUD PRODUCT OF OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS. AND APART FROM THE FANTASTIC LEADER, TEACHERS AND COACHES, THAT I HAD, THROUGH MY EXPERIENCE AT THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS, I THINK WHAT GAVE ME THE MOST MEANING AND BENEFIT FROM THAT EXPERIENCE WAS THE DIVERSITY OF CLASSMATES AND FRIENDS. JUST LEARNING FROM DIFFERENT KIDS WITH DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS AND DIFFERENT LIFE EXPERIENCES. FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO SPENT ANYWHERE LIVES HERE. AS THE COST OF LIVING HAS INCREASED, THE REALITIES OF GETTING INTO ANN ARBOR AND PUTTING YOUR KIDS THROUGH THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM GETS HARDER AND HARDER. HOW CAN LOCAL GOVERNMENT MAKE A DIFFERENCE? I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO LEVEL SET. THE TWO MOST POWERFUL AND DIRECT TOOLS TO LOWER HOUSING COSTS ARE ILLEGAL IN THE STATE OF MICHIGAN. THE FIRST IS INCLUSIONARY ZONING, WHICH SAYS, HEY, DEVELOPER, IF YOU BUILD 100 UNITS OF HOUSING, X PERCENT NEED TO BE AFFORDABLE. ILLEGAL IN THE STATE OF MICHIGAN. THE SECOND IS RENT CONTROL. RENT CONTROL SAYS, HEY, LANDLORD, YOUR BUILDING WAS BUILT BEFORE YEAR X, THEREFORE, YOU CAN ONLY INCREASE YOUR RENT AT Y PERCENT EACH YEAR. THAT STABILIZES RENTAL COSTS AND IS A GREAT BENEFIT TO TENANTS. ILLEGAL IN THE STRAIT OF MICHIGAN -- ILLEGAL IN THE STATE OF MICHIGAN. THERE ARE THESE PILLARS THAT WE HAVE TO WORK WITH WHEN IT COMES TO AFFORDABLE. INCENTIVES. WE CAN INCORRECTIVIZE THE DEVELOPERSES AND THE SECOND IS SUBSUBSIDY. AND THEN THE THIRD IS WE CAN INCREASE THE SUPPLY OF HOUSING. SO WE HAVE MADE PROGRESS ON EACH OF THESE PILLARS AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN ALL BE PROUD OF. WE HAVE ALL SHARED IN THAT OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST TWO YEARS, SOME OF US LONGER. WITH RESPECT TO INCENTIVES WE PAPASSED A REGULATORY CHANGE IN EXCHANGE FOR HEIGHT AND DENSITY IN OUR DOWNTOWN DISTRICTS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WITH RESPECT TO DIRECT SUBSIDY, THE ANN ARBOR HOUSING COMMISSION IS PURSUING CONSTRUCTION EVER HUNDREDS OF NEW AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS ON PUBLICLY OWNED LAND AND I HOPE WE CONTINUE TO PUSH THEM FORWARD ON THAT. AND THEN FINALLY, WITH RESPECT TO HOUSING SUPPLY, DOWNTOWN HAS DENSIFIED SOME IN THE LAST TEN YEARS BUT EVEN THAT DENSIFICATION, EVEN THAT ADDITION OF BEDROOMS DON'T KEEP UP PACE WITH THE NEW ENROMMENT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN. NOT TO MENTION THE NEW JOBS CREATED BY BOTH UNIVERSITY AND NEW SECTORS OF OUR LOCAL ECONOMY. AND I WILL SAY HERE, RESEARCHERS FROM THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, FROM HARVARD, TO MIT AND BERKELEY AND THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN HERE IN ANN ARBOR, ALL SAY THAT MORE HOUSING SUPPLY LOWERS HOUSING COSTS. THERE IS NO ACADEMIC DEBATE ON THE SUBJECT, PERIOD. NONE. THIS IS NOT A FAD. INCREASING HOUSING SUPPLIES ESPECIALLY ON LONG TRANSIT CORRIDORS IS A PROVEN SOLUTION MEASURED TANGIBLY OVER DECADES. SO THIS PROPOSAL CHARGES THE PLANNING COMMISSION TO CREATE A NEW ZONING DISTRICT THAT WILL MAKE HOUSING MORE AFFORDABLE THROUGH INCENTIVE AND SUPPLY. TWO OF THE THREE PILLARS THAT WE HAVE AT OUR DISPOSAL. IT PUTS THE WEIGHT OF COUNCIL BEHIND THE IDEA AND THE CONCEPT, AND PROVIDES A DEADLINE SO THE PUBLIC KNOWS THAT WE TAKE OUR AFFORDABLE AND SUSTAINABILITY ISSUES AS SERIOUSLY AS WE CLAIM TO. NOW, I WANT TO TURN MY ATTENTION A LITTLE BIT TO THREE AREAS OF CONCERN THAT WERE ARTICULATED BY THE SMALL HANDFUL OF EMAILS THAT WE GOT, WHO VOICED CONCERN. THE FIRST IS AROUND PARKING. THE RESOLUTION OFFERS THAT THERE MAY NOT BE NO MINIMUM AMOUNT OF PARKING REQUIRED, POTENTIALLY. AND THIS TYPE OF ZONING ALLOWS RESIDENTS TO MEET MORE OF THEIR DAILY NEEDS LIKE GETTING TO WORK, GETTING TO SCHOOL, GETTING TO SHOPPING, E USING TRANSIT. OUR TRANSIT SYSTEM, THE RIDE, CLOCKS 6.6 MILLION RIDES PER YEAR, AND MOST OF OUR TRANSIT CORRIDORS SEE BUSES STOPPING EVERY 10 TO 15 MINUTES. WE HAVE CAPACITY. WE HAVE A TRANSIT SYSTEM WITH A TRACK RECORD OF DELIVERING ON IT. ULTIMATELY, THERE WILL NEVER BE NO PARKING, THOUGH. THE BANKS WHO LEND MONEY TO DEVELOPERS WOULD NEVER ALLOW THAT. IT'S JUST NOT PART OF THEIR FINANCIAL MODEL. BUT IF PARKING IS A CONCERN, LET THAT BE DEALT WITH, WHEN THE ZONING IS IMPLEMENTED, IN DIFFERENT DISTRICTS. FOR EXAMPLE, THERE ARE FEW -- AND REALLY, THERE ARE NO RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORS TO THE SOUTH STATE STREET AREA, NEAR BRIARWOOD MALL. AND THESE HYPOTHETICAL RESIDENTS BROUGHT THEIR HYPOTHETICAL CARS THEY MIGHT HYPOTHETICAL FLOOD RESEARCH PARK DRIVE WITH THEIR CARS. A LOT LESS RISK THAN MAYBE OTHER AREAS, AND LET'S HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS AS THE REALITIES BECOME MORE EVIDENT. THE I CAN  SECOND ISSUE IS SUSTAINABILITY. AND SOME HAVE TALKED ABOUT SOLAR AND GREEN ROOFS AND ALLOWING MORE PEOPLE TO USE TRANSIT FOR THEIR COMMUTE, AND NOT DRIVE IN FROM PLYMOUTH OR SCIO WILL REDUCE CARBON EMISSIONS. THAT'S ABSOLUTELY A FACT. BY REDUCING JUST ONE PERSON'S COMMUTE BY 10 MILES, THAT WOULD BE 20 MILES ROUND TRIP. WE COULD MAKE THE SAME IMPACT ON CARBON EMISSIONS AS PLANTING 100 TREES. A HUGE POTENTIAL FOR CARBON REDUCTION. ALL THAT SAID, I HEAR YOU ON THIS ONE. THAT IS WHY THEY EXPLORE SUCH MANDATES. I PROMISE THE LAST ONE, AROUND TIMING. WITH RESPECT TO THE MASTER PLANNING PROCESS, THIS IS AN IDEA THAT HAS BEEN IN OUR CURRENT MASTER PLAN AND SUSTAINABILITY PLANS AND FRAMEWORK FOR OVER A DECADE. BOTH OF THESE DOCUMENTS ARE THE PRODUCT OF EXTENSIVE PUBLIC INPUT THAT SPANS MULTIPLE DECADES AND NOW IT'S TIME TO TURN THOSE PROMISES MADE BY THOSE PLANS, LIKE OUR CURRENT MASTER PLAN INTO SOME FORM OF ACTION OR AT LEAST A TOOL THAT CAN BE APPLIED AS ACTION. THEN WITH RESPECT TO THE COVID CRISIS, FROM THE WASHTENAW HOUSING ALLIANCE, WHICH IS ONE OF OUR FOREMOST LEADERS IN THE COUNTY AROUND AFFORDABLE HOUSING, I WILL QUOTE FROM ONE OF THEIR REPRESENTATIVES. NOW IS EXACTLY THE TIME TO BE THINKING ABOUT THE LONG-TERM ISSUES WE ARE GOING TO FACE DUE TO HOUSING SHORTAGES AND SUSTAINABILITY ISSUES. THERE'S NO BETTER TIME TO ACT THAN NOW ON MO MOVING THIS DEVELOPMENT THROUGH THE CITY PROCESS. IT CREATES ONE MORE ZONING TOOL TO UTILIZE IN THE FUTURE. IT DOES NOT RESOLVE IN ANY WAY IN ITSELF. IT'S NOT MEANT TO RUSH ANYTHING THROUGH A PROCESS, BUT INSTEAD SIMPLY LENGTHEN OUR RUNWAY SO THAT WE ARE READY WHEN WE HAVE OUR NEW MASTER PLAN READY TO GO. WILL LEAVE IT THERE. I HOPE THIS WILL LEAD TO SOME CONCERN AND WHAT WE CAN ACCOMPLISH IN ATOABLE HOUSING AS -- AFFORDABLE HOUSING AS WE CONTINUE.
03:22:10.394: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
03:22:11.228: >> Councilmember Lumm: IF IT'S COUNCIL'S PLEASURE TO TABLE IT OR POSTPONE IT, I'M OKAY WITH THAT, BUT IF WE VOTE ON IT, I WILL BE VOTING NO AND HERE'S WHY. NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO EMBARK DOWN A PATH OF POTENTIALLY CHANGING ZONING AND LAND USE PLANS THAT WOULD HAVE DRAMATIC IMPACTS ON LARGE CHUNKS OF THE CITY. EVEN WITHOUT COVID-19, THE TIMING IS NOT RIGHT. THE MASTER PLAN UPDATE SHOULD BE DONE FIRST. OR PERHAPS CONCURRENTLY. MAIMER DECISIONS LIKE THIS TO -- MAJOR DECISIONS LIKE THIS TO ADD A ZONING CLASSIFICATION SHOULD NOT BE MADE IN A VACUUM, THEY SHOULD BE PART OF THE MASTER PLAN UPDATE, WHERE THEY CAN BE DISCUSSED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE WHOLE CITY. AND THEN FACTOR IN COVID-19 AND HOW IT'S IMPACTING EVERYONE'S LIFE LIVES THEIR FOCUS AND ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND THE IDEA OF MOVING AHEAD ON SOMETHING THIS IMPORTANT WHEN PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT IS SO DIFFICULT, SEEMS INAPPROPRIATE, UNNECESSARY, AND AN INCULT TO THE COMMUNITY -- INSULT TO THE COMMUNITY. I'M SURE MY COLLEAGUES WOULD SAY THIS RESOLUTION IS NOT A BIG DEAL, AND IT'S JUST ANOTHER TOOL IN THE TOOL BOX. IT'S JUST ASKING PLANNING COMMISSION TO LOOK AT SOMETHING. IT'S MUCH, MUCH MORE THAN THAT. IT SECONDS SPECIFIC DIRECTIONS AND PREFERENCES TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION. PREFERENCES AND DIRECTIONS THAT HAVE HAD THE BENEFIT OF VIRTUAL ZERO PUBLIC INPUT. AND BY HAVING A DEADLINE OF JUNS ESSENTIALLY SAYING THE PLANNING COMMISSION, DON'T WORRY ABOUT PLANNING ENGAGEMENT, DUST OFF THE ITEM IN THE FALL AND BRING IT BACK TO COUNCIL. THAT'S AN INSULT TO RESIDENTS, ESPECIALLY TO THOSE IN THE CORRIDORS AROUND THESE TRANSIT CORRIDORS. SOUTH STATE, WASHTENAW, PLYMOUTH, WEST STADIUM, PACKARD AND ANN ARBOR. THE CHARACTER OF THESE ARE QUITE DIFFERENT, YET THE DRAFT ORDINANCE THIS A ONE SIZE FITS ALL SIZE OF RULES AND THAT'S NOT APPROPRIATE EITHER. THERE'S NO, NO, HEIGHT OR MASS LIMITS TO THE BUILDINGS. NONE. ANY SIZE BUILDING WOULD BE BY RIGHT FOR DEVELOPER AND WE WOULD HAVE NO LEGAL BASIS TO STOP IT. AND THERE ARE NO MINIMUM SETBACKS BUT A MAXIMUM FRONT SETBACK OF 10 FEET. CLEARLY, THE VISION IS LARGE BUILDINGS BUILT RIGHT UP TO THE STREET. SOME FOLKS MAY THINK THAT'S FINE IN ALL OF THESE CORRIDORS. I'M NOT SO SURE. THERE'S NO SPECIFIC LANGUAGE RELATED AFFORDABLE HOUSING OR ENERGY EFFICIENCY OF THE BUILDINGS. SO THE IMPACTS ON THE TWO PRIORITIES DRIVING THE INITIATIVE IN THE FIRST PLACE ARE NOT CLEAR. THE DRAFT HAS NO PARKING MINIMUMS, JUST MAXIMUMS. SO THE CONCERN THAT THERE ARE CARS SPILLING INTO THE NEIGHBORHOODS IS A VALID ONE, UNTIL THERE'S ADEQUATE TRANSIT OPTIONS. UNFORTUNATELY THE ROBUST TRANSIT SYSTEM TO MAKE THE WHOLE TRANSIT SYSTEM DISTRICT WORK IS NOT IN PLACE IN ANN ARBOR RIGHT NOW. THAT IS UNFORTUNATE, BUT THAT'S A REALITY. THAT'S ANOTHER REASON THAT THE TIMING IS NOT RIGHT. WE KEEP MAKING THE SAME MISTAKE OVER AND OVER AGAIN IN ANN ARBOR. WE APPROVE RESIDENTIAL RELATE DEVELOPMENTS WITHOUT HAVING THE NECESSARY SUPPORTIVE INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE AND THAT'S TRUE FOR NORTHEAST ANN ARBOR WITH THE NIXON DEVELOPMENTS, WITH LOWER TOWN AND OTHER DEVELOPMENTS. IMPLEMENTING A TRANSIT ZONING DISTRICT WITHOUT ADEQUATE SUPPORTING TRANSIT IS THE SAME MISTAKE AGAIN ON STEROIDS. ANYWAY, I SUSPECT SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES WILL OFFER AMENDMENTS AND THAT'S FINE. BUT FOR ALL THE REASONS I MENTIONED, I DON'T BELIEVE THE TIMING IS RIGHT TO EMBARK ON THIS PATH AT ALL, REGARDLESS OF HOW RESOLUTION IS TWEAKED. IF IT'S COUNCIL'S PLEASURE TO TABLE THIS I WOULD SUPPORT THAT. BUT BEFORE PROPOSING, IT I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM OTHERS. THANKS FOR LISTENING.
03:26:19.209: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
03:26:31.488: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. I HAVE TWO MAJOR CONCERNS BEFORE I CAN GO INTO THIS RESOLUTION. TWO OUTSTANDING CONCERNS THAT I NEED TO PREFACE BEFORE GOING INTO ANY DETAIL THAT MY COLLEAGUE COUNCILMEMBER LUMM DID WITH REALLY ALMOST PERFECTION IN TERMS THE ISSUES THAT THIS RESOLUTION HAS. AND THOSE TWO THINGS ARE THE OBVIOUS COVID-19, AND WE HAVE ALREADY BEEN WARNED NOT TO USE THAT AS A MEASURE TO ADVANCE OR DETRADETRACT FROM THINGS, BUT TT IS -- THAT IS WHAT'S GOING ON OUTSIDE RIGHT NOW. THE LACK OF PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT IS A HUGE CONCERN OF MINE. FRANKLY, I THINK IT'S TIME TO REALLY ADDRESS THIS LONGSTANDING ISSUE WE HAVE. IT'S BEEN 217 DAYS SINCE COUNCIL VOTED ON WHETHER COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN SHOULD BE SERVING ON THE PLANNING COMMISSION. COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN DID NOT RECEIVE THE BLESSINGS OF COUNCIL. I VOTED FOR HIM. HE DID NOT GET APPROVAL BY COUNCIL FOR COUNCIL'S REPRESENTATION ON PLANNING COMMISSION. I FIND THAT HUGELY PROBLEMATIC. HUGELY PROBLEMATIC! SO MUCH SO THAT I WON'T SUPPORT THIS TYPE OF RESOLUTION DIRECTING PLANNING TO DO ANYTHING UNTIL COUNCIL GETS THE RIGHT AND A APPROVED REPRESENTATION OF PLANNING. THAT'S NOT ANYTHING PERSONAL. THAT'S GOOD GOVERNMENT. WE DON'T HAVE REPRESENTATION ON PLANNING COMMISSION. WE DESERVE REPRESENTATION ON PLANNING COMMISSION. IT'S BEEN 217 DAYS. WHEN WILL WE GET OUR REPRESENTATION ON PLANNING?
03:28:36.379: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND? COUNCILMEMBER GRAND, YOU ARE ON MUTE.
03:28:50.026: >> Councilmember Grand: YEAH, SORRY. IT GOT STUCK. SORRY ABOUT THAT. I WANT TO RESPOND TO A LOT OF THESE CONCERNS. ONE, FIRST AND FOREMOST, THAT WAS RAISED BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, I WANT TO RESPOND TO A LOT OF THESE. I THINK THIS IS A REALLY BIG DEAL. I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT STEPS WE CAN TAKE TO ADDRESS HOUSING AFFORDABILITY, TO ADDRESS SUSTAINABILITY, TO ADDRESS HOUSING THAT'S MISSING IN THE CITY. I THINK THIS IS A TREMENDOUS DEAL WHICH IS WHY IT HAS SUCH BROAD BASED COMMUNITY SUPPORT TO MOVE FORWARD ON THIS. WHY MANY OF US THAT SIT AT THIS COUNCIL TABLE DURING CAMPAIGNS CAME OUT IN SUPPORT OF TRANSIT-ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT. SO I THINK IT'S A BIG DEAL BUT I ALSO THINK IT'S A BIG DEAL BECAUSE IT'S ONE OF THE SMARTEST THINGS WE CAN DO TO HELP ADDRESS THE CRISIS WE HAD IN HOUSING AND TO LOOK AT THE COMMITMENT THAT WE HAVE MADE TO THIS CLIMATE CRISIS. THAT WE SUPPORTED UNANIMOUSLY. I THINK THERE WILL BE LOTS OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT. THIS IS NOT A SLOW PROCESS. WE ARE LOOKING AT A PROCESS OF ONE TO TWO YEARS, BEST CASE SCENARIO, BEFORE THIS ACTUALLY COMES TO FRUITION. SO I THINK THAT SPEAKS TO THE CONCERNS ABOUT TIMING THAT, YOU KNOW, EVENTUALLY WE ARE GOING TO HAVE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PUBLIC INPUT. PLANNING COMMISSION HAS ALREADY BEEN WORKING ON THIS, BUT THERE IS A REALLY, I THINK BIG ISSUE EVER TRUST THAT PLANNING COMMISSION HAS WORKED ON ISSUES IN THE PAST, BUT THEN COUNCIL DOESN'T VOTE FOR THEM WHEN THEY BRING IT FORWARD. I THINK THEY ARE LOOKING FOR DIRECTION BEFORE THEY INVEST MORE TIME IN THIS EFFORT AND I THINK THAT'S FAIR. YOU KNOW, THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT IS BY RIGHT. IT'S A TOOL. IT'S A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TOOL. IT'S A TOOL THAT EVEN DURING THIS TIME OF CRISIS, WE ARE HEARING FROM LOTS OF PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY, SAYING -- AND DIFFERENT MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, THIS IS NOT JUST ONE GROUP THAT WE ARE HEARING FROM. THIS IS THE KIND OF HOUSING THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY WANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SO THAT THEY CAN CONTRIBUTE AND LIVE HERE. AND LIVE A SUSTAINABLE LIFE AND CONTRIBUTE TO BUSINESSES ALONG THE CORRIDOR. SO IF YOU HAVE BEEN IN FAVOR OF TRANSIT-ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT IN THE PAST, I HOPE THAT YOU WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS OPPORTUNITY TO STATE YOUR VALUES. I WANT TO ADDRESS THE CONCERN ABOUT COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN, SINCE IT WAS PUT SO BLUNTLY. I HAVE NO ISSUE BEING BLUNT BACK. I GUESS YOU WILL GET A NEW COUNCILMEMBER WHEN YOU GET ON A PLANNING -- ON A PLANNING COMMISSION WHEN YOU GET A NEW MAYOR.
03:32:03.586: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER SMITH.
03:32:09.325: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: POINT OF ORDER. MR. TAYLOR, YOU ARE OUR MAYOR. COUNCILWOMAN GRAND, I'M NOT WAITING AROUND FOR A NEW MAYOR. WE HAVE A MAYOR. WILL.
03:32:24.040: >> Councilmember Grand: HE HAS THE RIGHT TO APPOINT WHOEVER HE WANTS TO APPOINT TO PLANNING COMMISSION. SO MY COLLEAGUES CALL OUT MY OTHER COLLEAGUES, I'M GOING TO STAND UP FOR HIM. THAT'S ALL.
03:32:34.350: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER SMITH, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
03:32:37.287: >> Councilmember Smith: THANK YOU. YOU KNOW, AS I LOOK AT THIS, COVID-19 IS -- I HAVE SEEN TWO DIFFERENT RESPONSES, NOT JUST IN ANN ARBOR, BUT ACROSS THE COUNTRY. ONE IS THE CIRCLE THE WAGONS MENTALITY THAT IS, HEY, YOU KNOW, IF WE JUST HAVE NET ZERO BUILDINGS AND LOWRISE BUILDINGS AND SEAL OFF OUR BORDERS, WE WILL BE OKAY. WE WILL BE MORE RESILIENT THAN WE ARE NOW AND I LOOK AT THAT AS WE HAVE ONE GIANT VARIABLE THAT WE DON'T CONTROL AND WE HAVE NO INFLUENCE OVER, AND THAT'S UNIVERSITY. AND I DON'T THINK THE UNIVERSITY IS GOING AWAY. I DON'T THINK IT'S GETTING SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER AND WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. OR WE -- [ NO AUDIO ] WHAT THE QUALITY OF LIFE IS, HOW OUR SUSTAINABILITY IS. THERE'S JUST NO GETTING AROUND THAT, THAT 900-POUND C GORILLA. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT THE COVID PANDEMIC AS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR HOW WE PLAN TO BE MORE RESILIENT IN THE FUTURE. SOME OF THAT IS FIGURING OUT HOW WE CAN ALLOW PLACES TO BE BUILT TO ALLOW FOR PEOPLE TO LIVE IN PLACES WHERE THEY DON'T NEED TO GET IN CARS, WHERE THEY CAN GET THEIR GOODS AND SERVICES WITHIN A 15-MINUTE WALK, WHICH IS ABOUT A HALF A MILE. YOU KNOW? OUR LAND USES ARE SO SEGREGATED ACROSS THE CITY, THAT THERE'S SO MANY NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE IT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO WALK AND GET A QUART OF MILK ANY PLACE. SO I THINK THAT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY TO START THE PROCESS OF UNDERSTANDING WHAT A MORE RESILIENT COMMUNITY LOOKS LIKE AND STARTING THIS PROCESS NOW. YOU KNOW, YOU CAN SAY LET'S NOT DO IT. LET'S WAIT. I DON'T KNOW WHEN THE MASTER PLAN WILL GET GOING BECAUSE IF THE RATIONALE THAT, YOU KNOW, HE WITH CAN'T MOVE FORWARD ON THIS BECAUSE NOBODY WILL PARTICIPATE, WE CERTAINLY CAN'T MOVE FORWARD ON THE MASTER PLAN. YOU KNOW, I THINK PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF OUR PETTY SNIPING IN THIS ROOM. I THINK THEY ARE EXHAUSTED BY THIS. AND HOW WE WORK TOGETHER. FRANKLY, I'M IN THAT SAME BOAT. YOU KNOW, I TRY AS HARD AS I CAN TO FIGURE OUT WAYS TO GO FORWARD, TO TRY TO FIND SOME COMMON GROUND AND THERE JUST DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ANY OF THAT DEVELOPMENT AND THAT'S ASHAME. SO, YOU KNOW, I THINK THIS IS THE WAY TO GO FORWARD. I THINK IT'S RESPONSIBLE. I THINK IT TAKES THIS TIME THAT WE HAVE TO REIMAGINE HOW WE CAN BE A MORE RESILIENT PLACE COMING OUT OF THIS, BUT, YOU KNOW, MAYBE YOU GUYS DON'T AGREE.
03:35:44.540: >> Mayor Taylor: I'M GOING TO AMEND THE QUEUE ON THIS. THE TRANSITORY DEVELOPMENT IS LOW HANGING FRUIT. WE HAVE MORE PEOPLE THAT WORK IN ANN ARBOR THAN CAN AFFORD TO LIVE IN ANN ARBOR. AND OTT ONLY WAY TO A -- AND THE ONLY WAY TO ACHIEVE A GOAL WHERE MORE PEOPLE WHO WORK HERE ARE ABLE TO LIVE HERE IS TO CREATE A BROAD SET OF HOUSING THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR THEM. SOME OF IT WILL BE CITY SPONSORED AFFORDABLE AND OTHER WILL BE MARKET. PUTTING PEOPLE -- ALLOWING PROPERTY OWNERS TO BUILD HOMES, MIXED USE DEVELOPMENTS ON TRANSIT CORRIDORS WITH REAL AND MATERIAL DENSITY, WHICH WILL OF ITS NATURE BE MORE -- PARDON ME, BE M MORE AFFORD THAN OTHER PARS OF OUR COMMUNITY, WHICH WILL BY ITS NATURE PROVIDE, YOU KNOW, FOR NEW RESIDENTS WHICH WILL NO LONGER NEED A CAR WITHOUT THE SAME DEGREE OF REGULARITY THAN I DO TODAY. IT ACHIEVES THE GOAL OF REDUCED ECONOMIC SEGREGATION. IT WOULD ACHIEVE OUR GOAL OF, YOU KNOW, IMPROVING OUR CARBON NEUTRALITY, AND FRANKLY, IT WOULD -- IT WOULD ACHIEVE A GOAL OF IMPROVING FINANCIAL HEALTH OF OUR COMMUNITY BECAUSE AS WE ALL KNOW HERE AT THIS TABLE AND ELSEWHERE, WE -- THE NATURE OF THE MUNICIPAL FINANCE IN MICHIGAN, IF W WE DO NOT GROW, E AS A COMMUNITY GO BACKWARDS. OUR COSTS OUTSTRIP THE NATURAL INCREASE OF OUR REVENUE, AND SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE FRANKLY NEED TO DO IF WE ARE TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES THAT OUR RESIDENTS PRESENTLY ENJOY AND THE ADDITIONAL SERVICES THAT OUR COMMUNITY PRESENTLY DEMANDS. THE EFFORTS TO PUT TOGETHER A ZONING DISTRICT, A TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT ON THE PART OF THE PLANNING COMMISSION IS SOMETHING THAT IS PLAINLY ACHIEVABLE. IT'S SOMETHING THAT THEY CAN DO NOW, AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD -- WE SHOULD CHARGE THEM TO DO, SO THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO GAIN THE BENEFITS OF IT IN THE FUTURE. COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
03:38:18.461: >> Councilmember Eaton: THANK YOU. PLANNING COMMISSION AND PLANNING STAFF HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS CONCEPT FOR MANY, MANY YEARS. I WAS JUST LOOKING THROUGH MY MATERIALS AND I CAME ACROSS A JUNE 2017 MEMO FROM STAFF TO THE PLANNING DIRECTOR, POINTING OUT THAT THIS T1 CONCEPT REALLY ISN'T TEXTBOOK TRANSIT ORIENTED AT ALL. IT JUST DOESN'T FIT THAT MOLD. WE ARE JUST USING THAT AS A TITLE. BUT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS AND WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS FOR A VERY LONG TIME. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE YOU AT THIS POINT IN TIME OPINE, RATHER THE PLANNING COMMISSION SHOULD CONTINUE TO LISTEN TO RESIDENTS. I ATTENDED A PUBLIC HEARING AT THE PLANNING COMMISSION ON OCTOBER 1st OF LAST YEAR. AND THIS WAS A ROBUST DISCUSSION THAT REPRESENTED HAD MULTIPLE POINTS OF VIEW, NOT JUST THE SINGLE POINT OF VIEW THAT WAS GENERATED BY THE ADVOCACY GROUPS THAT GOT EVERYBODY TO SEND EMAILS TO US IN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS. I BELIEVE THAT THAT IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS DISCUSSION OF FORMULATING A NEW ZONING DISTRICT. WE SHOULD CONTINUE THAT PUBLIC PROCESS, BUT RIGHT NOW, WE REALLY CAN'T BECAUSE THE LAPPING COMMISSION IS NOT SET UP TO HAVE -- THE PLANNING COMMISSION IS NOT SET UP TO HAVE THAT TYPE OF ROBUST PUBLIC HEARING UNDER THIS KIND OF SCENARIO WHERE WE ARE ALL USING ZOOM, RATHER THAN MEETING IN PERSON. THIS RESOLUTION CALLS FOR PLANNING COMMISSION TO BRING A RECOMMENDATION TO US BY JUNE 15th. WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THE STATE EMERGENCY ORDER WILL HAVE BEEN LIFTED BY THAT POINT IN TIME. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF PUBLIC INPUT CAN BE SOUGHT IN A MEANINGFUL WAY, BETWEEN NOW AND THEN. SO I'M GOING TO MOVE THAT WE TABLE THIS RESOLUTION UNTIL THE STATE LIFTS ITS EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT ORDER, AND I HOPE THAT YOU WILL SUPPORT THAT -- THAT TABLE.
03:40:42.104: >> Mayor Taylor: I THINK A TABLING DOES NOT HAVE A TIME ASSOCIATED.
03:40:49.812: >> Councilmember Eaton: A TABLING IS ASSOCIATED WITH AN EVENT. I COULD SET A DATE, BUT I WOULD SIMPLY BE GUESSING AS TO WHEN THE GOVERN BEER MIGHT LIFT THE ORDER, WHEREAS I CAN TABLE CONTINGENT ON HER LIFTING THAT ORDER. BECAUSE I BELIEVE THIS WEEK SHE'S GOING TO EXTEND IT AGAIN AND SHE WILL CONTINUE TO EXTEND IT UNTIL, IN FACT, THE STATE HAS A GRIP ON THE PANDEMIC. SO I THINK TABLING TIN CONTINGEN THE LIFTING OF THE STATE EMERGENCY ORDER.
03:41:21.243: >> Mayor Taylor: BY THAT DO I INFER THAT IT WILL COME BACK TO THE AGENDA -- PARDON ME THE MEETING AFTER THE LIFTING OF THE EMERGENCY ORDER -- THE STATE OF EMERGENCY?
03:41:30.286: >> Councilmember Eaton: WELL, YEAH. UPON THE LIFTING OF THE ORDER, ANY COUNCILMEMBER CAN MOVE TO TAKE IT OFF THE TABLE.
03:41:41.630: >> Councilmember Lumm: I WILL SECOND THE TABLING.
03:41:45.701: >> Mayor Taylor: I BELIEVE ANY COUNSEL -- THE MOTION TO TABLE HAS BEEN SECONDED. I DON'T KNOW HAVE ROBERTS RULES IN FRONT OF ME. IT SEEMS LIKE IF IT'S ON THE TABLE, IT'S ON THE TABLE. I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU CAN DOUBLE LOCK IT TO PREVENT A COUNCILMEMBER BRINGING IT UP PRIOR TO A DATE CERTAIN.
03:42:06.755: >> Councilmember Eaton: WELL, WE CAN DEBATE ROBERT'S RULES LATER. THIS IS A MOTION AND A SECOND ON THE TABLING. I BELIEVE THAT A MOTION -- IS.
03:42:15.931: >> Mayor Taylor: THAT'S IN ORDER.
03:42:18.667: >> Councilmember Eaton: A MOTION TO TABLE IS NOT SUBJECT TO DEBATE AND WE SHOULD PL PROCEEDO A VOTE.
03:42:25.407: >> Councilmember Nelson: MAYOR, WAS THAT SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
03:42:29.545: >> Mayor Taylor: IT WAS.
03:42:34.283: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, QUESTION OF ORDER? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, WERE YOU SPEAKING?
03:42:44.193: >> Councilmember Hayner: OH, -- YEAH. I THINK SO, BUT EVERYTHING IS SEIZING UP OVER HERE WITH MY INTERNET. SO IS THAT ACCURATE, MR. POSTEMA, TABLING IS SUBJECT DIRECTLY TO A VOTE AND NOT A DEBATE.
03:43:00.743: >> City Atty. Postema: YOU KNOW, THAT'S THE ONE THING I DIDN'T BRING HOME IS MY ROBERT'S RULES OF ORDER. I CAN GO ON AND SPEND SOME TIME ON IT. I DO NOT HAVE AN ANSWER ON IT.
03:43:14.957: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I MEAN I WAS IN THE QUEUE TO SPEAK TO THE MAIN MOTION.
03:43:20.796: >> Mayor Taylor: SURE.
03:43:21.997: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I JUST WANTED TO ASK.
03:43:31.840: >> Mayor Taylor: I THINK PEOPLE HAVE A NOTION OF HOW THEY WILL VOTE. DOES ANYONE HAVE AN OBJECTION TO MOVING FORWARD ON THAT BASIS? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE ON THE TABLING STARTING WITH ME.
03:43:44.320: >> Mayor Taylor: NO.
03:43:45.154: >> Councilmember Eaton: YES.
03:43:45.754: >> Councilmember Nelson:  YES.
03:43:49.325: >> Councilmember Smith: NO.
03:43:49.925: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES.

03:44:06.008: >> Councilmember Ackerman: NO.
03:44:07.576: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION CARRIES.
03:44:09.612: >> Mayor Taylor: IT IS TABLED. DC-3 RESOLUTION TO APPROVE ANN ARBOR HOUSING COMMISSION EVICTION PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE AND APPROPRIATE $200,000. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN AND SECONDED BY BANNISTER. DISCUSSION EVER DC-3. COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN. ZACK THANK YOU, MR. ACKERMAN. I SPONSORED THE LAST RESOLUTION AND THIS RESOLUTION. SO I WANTED TO CLARIFY SOME MISSTATEMENTS FROM COLLEAGUES ON THE LAST ITEM AND THEN I WILL MOVE ON TO THIS ONE. I FEEL LIKE I WAS CUT OFF PREMATURELY AND IT'S SOMETHING --
03:44:44.580: >> Councilmember Eaton: POINT OF ORDER, MR. MAYOR.
03:44:45.681: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES, I AGREE.
03:44:47.850: >> Councilmember Eaton: WE HAVE VOTED ON THAT MATTER AND WE HAVE MOVED ON. HE HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK AT THE END OF THE MEETING IF HE HAS MORE TO T SAY ON THE SUBJEC.
03:44:59.595: >> Councilmember Ackerman: FAIR.
03:45:00.763: >> Mayor Taylor: I THINK AS A MATTER OF PRACTICE, PEOPLE OFTEN MAKE COMMENTS ABOUT PRIOR ACTIONS BY WAY OF EXAMPLE, COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER MADE A NON- -- A NONDIRECT -- A NONDIRECTED COMMENT WITH RESPECT TO A PRIOR MOTION. IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE TEND TO DO. IT'S A FREEDOM WE TEND TO ALLOW EACH OTHER. I DON'T SEE IT BEING ABUSED THEN OR HERE OR SUBSEQUENT IF COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN CHOOSES TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC -- AT COUNCIL COMMUNICATION ON THE BACK END. THAT'S HIS -- THAT'S HIS DECISION. HAD.
03:45:34.196: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  IS THAT GOING TO BE EXTENDED TO ALL OF US?
03:45:37.166: >> Mayor Taylor: I THINK WE ALL HAVE THE ABILITY BASICALLY TO SPEAK ABOUT WHAT WE WANT TO SPEAK ABOUT.
03:45:42.237: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I CAN STAY UP ALL NIGHT.
03:45:47.576: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
03:45:50.446: >> Councilmember Ackerman: DEBATING IT TOOK MORE TIME THAN I WANTED TO SAY. JUST WITH RESPECT TO DUSTING OF PLAN FROM THE FALL, THAT WASN'T THE INTENT. THE RESOLUTION IN FRONT OF US, ACTUALLY EXPLICITLY TOOK FEEDBACK WE GOT FROM THE PUBLIC AND TRIED TO INCORPORATE IT TO MAKE SURE IT WAS A PRODUCT THAT WAS PART OF THAT DIALOGUE -- OR CAME OUT OF THAT DIALOGUE AND THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO CLARIFY. THE -- WITH RESPECT TO THE RESOLUTION IN FRONT OF US NOW, THANK YOU TO TERESA GIOLLOTTI, FROM THE COUNTY AND TOM CRAWFORD FROM THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR, AS WELL AS COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER, MY COSPONSOR ON THIS ITEM. THIS IS SOMING THAT CAME OUT -- THIS IS SOMETHING THAT CAME OUT OF THE HOUSING ADVISORY BOARD MEETING. IT'S PLAIN THAT THE COVID CRISIS AND THE PUBLIC HEALTH SOLUTIONS THAT WE HAVE TO IMPLEMENT, THAT IS CLOSING ON CENTRAL BUSINESS IS HAVING HUGE ECONOMIC IMPACTS. MANY ECONOMIC RIPPLE EFFECTS THAT HARM THE MOST VULNERABLE AMONG US, WHICH ARE OFTENTIMES TENANTS OF ANN ARBOR HOUSING COMMISSION PROPERTIES. WE HAVE A SET OF TENANTS WHO FIND THEMSELVES IN A FINANCIAL HOLE. AND THAT WHEN THE STATE COURTS RELEASE THEIR HOLD ON EVICTIONS MAY FACE -- MAY FACE BECOMING HOMELESS VERY QUICKLY. I THINK AS A COMMUNITY, AND AN AFFLUENT ONE, IN FACT THE MOST AFFLUENT IN THE STATE, WITH HE CAN TAKE IT UPON OURSELVES TO HELP FILL THAT HOLE AND HELP THEM GET THROUGH THESE TIMES, SO THAT WHEN THE ECONOMY REBOUNDS, WHEN OUR LOCAL ECONOMY REBOUNDS AND OPENS UP AGAIN, THEY WILL BE HOUSED SECURELY, SAFELY AND CAN GO BACK TO WOULD. -- GO BACK TO WORK.
03:47:52.334: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
03:47:53.535: >> Councilmember Eaton: I WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A COSPONSOR ON THIS RESOLUTION. I ANTICIPATE THAT THAT IS GOING TO PASS UNANIMOUSLY. I DON'T BELIEVE ANYBODY IS OPPOSED TO HELPING THOSE WHO NEED HELP. I WOULD HOPE THAT THE COUNCIL'S PASSING OF THE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT RESOLUTION LAST MONTH IMBUES THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR WITH POWERS TO DO THIS SORT OF THING WITHOUT COMING TO US EXCEPT FOR APPROVAL AFTER THE FACT. I THINK THAT WE REALLY HAVE TO STRIVE TO HELP AS MANY PEOPLE AS WE CAN IN OUR COMMUNITY GET THROUGH THIS VERY, VERY DIFFICULT PERIOD OF TIME. WE'RE GOING TO REALLY HAVE A HORRIBLE ECONOMY FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE AND TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN HELP OUR RESIDENTS, WE SHOULD BE TRYING TO DO THAT. SO I SUPPORT THIS. I HOPE EVERYBODY ELSE DOES, AND I ENCOURAGE THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR TO USE THE EMERGENCY POWERS. THANK YOU.
03:48:50.092: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
03:48:50.959: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. THIS WAS ON LAST MONTH'S AGENDA, WHEN WE ONLY HAD SIX COUNCILMEMBERS AVAILABLE. SO IT WAS UNFORTUNATE THAT WE HAD TO WAIT A FEW EXTRA WEEKS BUT WE WERE REASSURED BY OUR CITY ADMINISTRATOR THAT HE COULD STILL ACT IN WAYS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FOLKS WHO NEEDED THIS HELP DIDN'T HAVE TO GO WITHOUT IT. SO I APPRECIATE THAT. I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED AS AHE COSPONSOR -- AS A COSPONSOR ON THAT. IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AT A TIME LIKE THIS AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DO AS A COMMUNITY, AS WE -- SOMETHING WE CAN DO AS A LOCAL COMMUNITY, AS A LOCAL GOVERNMENT, THAT IS MANY PEOPLE OBVIOUSLY IN THE COMMUNITY ASKED US TO HELP THE PEOPLE WHETHER AT THE HOMELESS SHELTER OR SUBSIDIZED HOUSING FOR ASSISTANCE AND FUNDING. SO THIS IS HOW WE CAN HELP AND THANKS FOR PUTTING THIS TOGETHER.
03:49:59.027: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
03:50:00.028: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. YEAH, THIS IS A -- THIS IS A FINE THING WE ARE DOING AND I APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT WE ARE DOING FOR ANN ARBOR HOUSING COMMISSION PROPERTIES AND I KNOW THERE WERE CONCERNS OVER THE COUNTY PROPERTIES LIKE THE -- YOU KNOW, THE DELONIS CENTER AND SO ON. I ENCOURAGE THOSE IN THE COUNTY AND IN THE COMMUNITY AND THE NONPROFIT SECTOR AND ANY PLACE ELSE WHO ANTICIPATES NEEDS OF ASSISTANCE TO REACH OUT TO THE CITY AND SO WE CAN START -- IT'S KIND OF ASSESSING WHAT THESE NEEDS ARE GOING TO BE FULLY. SO WHATEVER -- WHATEVER WE CAN DO FINANCIALLY TO HELP, WE WILL HAVE A WAY TO PRIORITIZE IT AND BALANCE IT AS THE NEEDS ARISE. AND I APPRECIATE THAT OUR CITY ADMINISTRATOR, THE INTERIM CITY ADMINISTRATOR SAID, AND I SAT WITH THEM IN THE SHELTER AND OTHER THINGS AND HOPEFULLY WE DIDN'T LEAVE ANYBODY BEHIND OR MISS ANYTHING, BECAUSE WE COULDN'T ALL SIT DOWN IN THAT FIRST MEETING EARLIER THIS MONTH OR LAST MONTH, RATHER. YES, THANK YOU FOR SUPPORTING THIS AND IT'S RIGHT AND APPROPRIATE THAT WE DO THIS AND ALSO FOLKS OUT THERE IN THE COMMUNITY, IF YOU HAVE NEEDS, DON'T BE AFRAID TO REACH OUT AND GET ON OUR LIST. I KNOW WE ARE GOING TO TRY TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO AND THERE'S A LOT OF NONPROFITS WORKING ON THIS AND OTHER THINGS AROUND THIS, AND I JUST -- YEAH, HOPEFULLY THIS MONEY IS GOING TO HELP KEEP THESE FOLKS IN -- IN THE SYSTEM. I WISH THAT WE COULD DO MORE. I KNOW THE GOVERNOR HAS SUSPENDED EVICTIONS AND THINGS. I GET A LOT OF CORRESPONDENCE FROM FOLKS IN THE COMMUNITY AROUND THE COUNTRY WHO ARE -- WHO ARE, YOU KNOW, BEGGING FOR AIST ASSISTANCE WITH RENT BECAUE THEY ARE OUT OF WORK. EVEN HOMEOWNERS DO THAT. I HOPE THAT WE CAN DO MORE.
03:51:57.679: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND?
03:52:02.918: >> City Admin. Crawford: MAY I MAKE A COMMENT?
03:52:05.120: >> Mayor Taylor: PLEASE, MR. CRAWFORD.
03:52:07.889: >> City Admin. Crawford: JUST FOR CLARIFICATION. I DO NOT BELIEVE -- AND WE CAN TAKE THIS OFFLINE, FOR ANOTHER TIME, THAT UNDER THE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT POWERS I COULD HAVE AAPPROVED THIS WITHOUT COUNCIL AUTHORITY. I DID INDICATE THAT I WAS AI BELIEVE TO HELP JENNIFER UP UNTIL NOW. SO SHE WAS ABLE TO GO UNTIL THIS NEXT MEETING. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO JUST REMIND PEOPLE THAT THE CITY IS NOT THE CLEARINGHOUSE FOR HUMAN SERVICE NEEDS. THEY REALLY NEED TO HIT THE COUNTY SERVICES THAT ARE ESTABLISHED. THEY ARE THE LEAD AGENCY ON HUMAN SERVICES.
03:52:42.257: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
03:52:45.227: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THAT CLARIFICATION. AS LIAISON TO THE HOUSING COMMISSION, I WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A COSPONSOR, PLEASE. I HAVE BEEN IN PRETTY REGULAR COMMUNICATION WITH MS. HALL AND I APPRECIATE MR. CRAWFORD'S EFFORTS. THERE ARE SOME PECULIARITIES ABOUT THE WAY THAT THE HOUSING COMMISSION IS FUNDED DUE TO ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CITY, THAT -- TEMPORARILY THEY CAN MOVE SOME THINGS AROUND BUT I SUSPECT THAT THEY WILL HAVE SOME MORE NEEDS IN THE FUTURE AND I CERTAINLY OFFERED MY SUPPORT TO MS. HALL IF SHE DOES BRING ANYTHING FORWARD, I WILL BE SURE TO BE RIGHT THIS TO DO IT. I APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S SUPPORT.
03:53:27.869: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
03:53:28.970: >> Councilmember Griswold: PLEASE ADD ME AS A COSPONSOR.
03:53:31.406: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
03:53:32.908: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANKS, MR. MAYOR. I APPRECIATE COUNCILMEMBERS ACKERMAN AND BANNISTER BROUGHT THIS FORWARD, AND AS COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI NOTED, WE HAD TO POSTPONE IT AT THE MARCH 16th MEETING BECAUSE OF THE EIGHT VOTE REQUIREMENT. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK MR. CRAWFORD FOR HIS REPORT AND ASSISTANCE, THE HOUSING COMMISSION AND MS. HALL. AND THIS REQUEST, WE ARE ALLOCATING THIS $200,000 FROM THE FUND TO THE HOUSING COMMISSION. THIS $200,000 REQUEST IS CONSISTENTENT WITH MS. HALL'S BUDGET HOUSING BUDGET PRESENTATION THAT SHE PRESENTED ON MARCH 23rd. CLEARLY, IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO. ALTHOUGH THERE'S NO DETAILS ON PRECEASELY HOW THIS WILL WORK AT THIS -- ON PRECISELY HOW THIS WILL WORK AT THIS POINT, I TRUST JENNIFER HALL TO MANAGE IT APPROPRIATELY AND RESPONSIBLY. AND I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MY NAME ADDED AS A SPONSOR, PLEASE.
03:54:48.583: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? I WOULD LIKE TO ADD MY THANKS TO THE COUNCILMEMBERS WHO BROUGHT THIS FORWARD AS THE INITIAL MATTER. IT IS A TIME WHERE WE WE ALL NEED TO BEND TO GO AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DO IS WE NEED TO CARE FOR THE NEEDIEST AMONG US AND TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITY. AND ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WE AS A -- AS AN ORGANIZATION PROVIDE SERVICES TO THOSE IN NEED IS THROUGH HOUSING, THROUGH OUR HOUSING COMMISSION, AS MR. CRAWFORD INDICATED, WE DO NOT AS A MUNICIPAL ORGANIZATION PROVIDE DIRECT HUMAN SERVICES. THAT TENDS TO BE A COUNTY FUNCTION BUT WE DO PROVIDE SOME HOUSING AND THIS IS ONE CASE, ONE INSTANCE IN WHICH WE ARE ABLE TO TAKE REAL AND MEANINGFUL ACTION TO SUPPORT FOLKS IN NEED. FURTHER DISCUSSION? MR. CRAWFORD?
03:55:49.511: >> City Admin. Crawford: JUST FOR ONE MORE CLARIFICATION. THE FUNDING FOR THIS WAS ORIGINALLY THOUGHT TO COME FROM THE RISE FUND BUT IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THAT WAS NOT AN APPROPRIATE SERVICE SO IT'S FROM THE GENERAL FUND, JUST FOR CLARIFICATION.
03:56:08.330: >> Councilmember Lumm: OH, THANKS.

YOU AND I SPONSORED THIS, AND JUST A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND ON MARCH 16th, OUR MAYOR ANNOUNCED THAT THE MARCH 23rd, MARCH 30th AND APRIL APRIL 13th WORK SESSIONS WERE CANCELED DUE TO UNCERTAINTY WAS TO WHETHER PUBLIC MEETINGS COULD BE HELD DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. THEN ON MARCH 18th, GOVERNOR WHITMER ISSUED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT AUTHORIZED WHAT WE'RE DOING TONIGHT, ELECTRONIC MEETINGS OF PUBLIC BODIES AND THIS RESOLUTION REVISES THE COUNCIL CALENDAR TO RESTORE THE APRIL 13th WORK SESSION, TO DISCUSS THE CARBON NEUTRALITY. AND I HOPE EVERYONE SUPPORTS IT.
04:33:58.598: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FURTHER DISCUSSION? IS THAT DISCUSSION COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
04:34:09.475: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES, JUST A QUICK QUESTION ON THIS, AND I KNOW WE MISSED A COUPLE LIVE WORK SESSIONS, THE OTHER ONE, THE DDA AND THE ANN ARBOR HOUSING COMMISSION'S, I THINK IT WAS WORK SESSION. IT WOULD BE NICE TO MAYBE HAVE MORE THAN JUST ONE TOPIC DISCUSSED, BUT JUST A QUICK QUESTION, IS IT GOING TO BE DONE IN THIS FORMAT? OR WHAT -- WHAT KIND OF FORMAT WILL THAT -- I MEAN, I UNDERSTAND IT'S ONLY A WEEK AWAY. WE PROBABLY WON'T BE DOING ANY IN COUNCIL CHAMBERS. WILL IT BE DONE IN THIS WAY?
04:34:51.484: >> Mayor Taylor: I EXPECT SO, YES.

WITH I SHOULD MENTION THAT THE RESOLUTION HAS BEEN TWEAKED A LITTLE BIT TO THE ORIGINAL VERSION, THANK YOU, MS. BEAUDRY, TO CORRECT A COUPLE OF DATES IN EPPIE -- OR TYPOS IN EPPIE'S BUYO.S. -- BIOS. SHE WAS NINE YEARS ON THE PLANNING COMMISSION, 11 YEARS ON THE ZBA, AND VOLUNTEERING ON SEVERAL OTHER PLANNING-RELATED COMMITTEES AND LOCAL NONPROFITS. SHE WAS AWARDED PRESERVIST OF THE YEAR AND HELPED TO ESTABLISH THE OLD WEST SIDE HISTORIC DISTRICT. HER BOOK "LEGENDARY LOCALS OF ANN ARBOR" SAID THIS ABOUT EPPIE. SHE IS A LEGEND AND SHE WAS A FIGHTER. SHE CARED DEEPLY ABOUT THE CITY AND SHE WORKED TENACIOUSLY TO BE THE CITY THAT IT IS TODAY. I WILL NOTE THIS QUOTE THAT APPEARS IN THE MEMORANDUM, IN THE INTRODUCTION FOR THIS RESOLUTION, AND IT'S A QUOTE FROM EPPIE. SHE SAID, AND THIS GOES BACK -- SHE SAID THIS IN 1970, "SOMEONE MUST TAKE A POSITIVE APPROACH TO THE CITY AND ITS NEEDS." OBVIOUSLY THAT WAS A LIFELONG GUIDING PRINCIPLE OF HER'S. MS. POTTS PASSED AWAY ON MARCH 29th AT THE AGE OF 95 AND THIS RESOLUTION RECOGNIZES HER LEADERSHIP, SERVICE AND EXAMPLE. SHE SET A TREMENDOUS EXAMPLE FOR ALL THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR, AND IF I MAY, I WILL JUST READ THE LAST TWO WHEREAS CLAUSES, "WHEREAS MS. POTTS THROUGH ALL OF HER CIVIC ENDEAVORS WAS AN INFORMED CRITIC, A SUPPORTER OF THOUGHTFUL POLICY AND SOUND COMMUNITY PLANNING AND NEIGHBORHOOD PRESERVATION BUT MOST OF ALL, A FIERCE, INFLEW ENTERRIAL AND  TENACIOUS ADVOCAE FOR ANN ARBOR. AND SHE WAS A POSITIVE MENTOR FOR MANY, MAKING A MO A MARK ONE COMMUNITY THAT SHE LOVED AND WORKED TIRELESSLY TO IMPROVE. THE MAYOR RECOGNIZES MS. POTTS FOR HER CONTRIBUTIONS AND EVERYTHING SHE LOVED. THANK YOU, VERY MUCH, EPPIE. EVERYONE OF ANN ARBOR APPRECIATES WHAT HAVE DONE FOR OUR CITY AND MAY YOU REST IN PEACE WITH THE KNOWLEDGE THAT YOUR EFFORTS AND CONTRIBUTIONS HAVE MADE ANN ARBOR A MUCH BETTER PLACE TO LIVE AND WORK. THANK YOU.
04:38:27.499: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN? ZA>> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I HAD THE PLEASURE OF SERVING ON THE PLANNING COMMISSION FOR THE LAST THREE AND A HALF YEARS NOW AND EPPIE WAS A PILLAR OF THAT EXPERIENCE. SHE WAS ALWAYS THERE AND PRESENT AND ENGAGED IN HER COMMUNITY, AND UNTIL THE LAST MONTHS, WAS LEANING IN TO TRY TO MAKE HER TOWN A BETTER PLACE. AND, YOU KNOW, WE AGREED ON MORE THAN PEOPLE WOULD THINK, AND IT'S MOSTLY BECAUSE OF HER TALENT, FOR THE DISCIPLINE. SHE WAS SO INCREDIBLY DETAILED ORANTED IN THE ZONING CODE AND THE APPLICATION ON DEVELOPMENT, THAT IT WAS CONSTRUCTIVE. LIKE, SO OFTEN AT PLANNING COMMISSION, THE FEEDBACK YOU GET FROM THE PUBLIC IS WE WANT MORE GOOD THINGS AND LESS BAD THINGS AND IT'S HARD TO DO SOMETHING WITH, THAT BUT EPPIE ALWAYS HAD SOMETHING TANGIBLE TO OFFER, TO PUSH THE CONVERSATION FORWARD SO I WAS APPRECIATIVE. BEYOND THAT, IT WAS JUST A KINDNESS AND AN EMPATHY, THAT, YOU KNOW, IN ANY FORM OF PUBLIC SERVICE, YOU TAKE YOUR BRUNT OF CRITICISM AND UGLINESS AT TIMES, BUT EVEN IN DISAGREEMENTS, SHE SAW THE GOOD IN PEOPLE, AND SHE ALWAYS ASSUMED GOOD INTENT. HER COMMENTS WERE -- BOTH FOR PUBLIC COMMENTS AND PRIVATE COMMENTS, WERE ALWAYS SUPPORTIVE AND KIND AND NEVER ACCUSATORY AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I THINK WE SHOULD ALL LEARN FROM AND TAKE TO HEART AND TRY TO APPLY IN OUR OWN WORDS.
04:40:28.887: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER EATON?
04:40:30.089: >> Councilmember Eaton: THANK YOU. I WANT TO THANK COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, WENDY CARMEN AND OUR STAFF FOR PUTTING THIS TOGETHER. I DID INITIATE THE IDEA OF PASSING A RESOLUTION TO NOTE HER PASSING, AND HER CONTRIBUTION TO OUR COMMUNITY, BUT OTHERS DID ALL OF THE HEAVY LIFTING AND I REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK THAT WAS DONE ON THIS. I MET EPPIE ABOUT 18 YEARS AGO, WHEN MY NEIGHBORHOOD WAS ORGANIZING TO LOBBY THE CITY COUNCIL. AND THROUGHOUT THE 18 YEARS THAT I HAVE KNOWN HER, SHE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A WISE AND TRUSTED ADVISOR, AND I WILL MISS HER DEEPLY, AND GRAVELY. WE HAVE MISSED A STELLAR MEMBER OF OUR COMMUNITY. SHE'S ALWAYS BEEN A NEIGHBORHOOD ACTIVIST AND ADVOCATE. I HOPE SOME OF US WILL CARRY ON HER WORK IN HER MEMORY AND GOOD OF OUR COMMUNITY. THANK YOU.
04:41:44.496: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
04:41:45.497: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, MAYOR. I WOULD BE REMISS, AS COUNCILMEMBER. 5th WARD, WHERE EPPIE RESIDED AND WHERE I FIRST GOT TO MEET HER, TO WEIGH IN ON A LITTLE BIT AND JUST OFFER MY CONDOLENCES TO HER LOVED ONES, TO THE COMMUNITY. IT'S REALLY UNFORTUNATE, AGAIN, THAT WE CAN'T HONOR HER LIFE AND LEGACY IN PERSON. SO IT'S ONLY APPROPRIATE THAT WE TAKE THE TIME HERE AND DO IT AND I WOULD -- WE JUST, YOU KNOW, ECHO A LOT OF WHAT HAS BEEN SAID, AND THE FACT THAT SHE WAS JUST A TROVE OF KNOWLEDGE AND WISDOM AND WEALTH OF INFORMATION. I THINK IT CAUGHT EVERYONE -- A LOT OF PEOPLE BY SURPRISE TO FIND OUT THAT SHE WAS 95. HER MIND WAS AS SHARP AS A TACK, RIGHT TO THE END. THERE WAS NO FOOLING HER. AND YET, EVEN WHEN SHE HAD DISAGREEMENTS, SHE HAD A VERY RESPECTFUL WAY OF EXPLAINING HER DIFFERENCES AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I DEFINITELY NEED TO LEARN MORE OF AND PERHAPS OTHERS. BUT AS I GET OLDER AND HOPEFULLY I LIVE TO THAT RIPE AGE OF 95, I WILL HAVE PERFECTED IT TO THE LEVEL THAT SHE HAD. AND LASTLY, I WOULD JUST LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A COSPONSOR IF I COULD, AND I APPRECIATE STAFF THAT HELPED TO PUT THIS TOGETHER. AND IT'S JUST -- IT'S JUST AN HONOR TO HONOR HER. THANK YOU.
04:43:28.300: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
04:43:30.736: >> Councilm?YOU ARE STILL ON MU.
04:43:41.580: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I'M FIGHTING A POP U POP-UP THAT'S G ME COMPUTER IS ABOUT TO RESTART. I FEEL OBLIGATED TO SAY SOMETHING. I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT WE HAD CROSSED PATHS IN MY DISTANT PATH. HER FIRST HUSBAND WILLIAM LEWIS WAS A PAINTING PROFESSOR IN COLLEGE, WHO I ADMIRED GREATLY AND HE HAS SOME BEAUTIFUL WORKS OF ART THAT HANG AROUND IN THE LEAGUE AND OTHER PLACES ON CAMPUS. I THINK I ACTUALLY KNEW HER BEFORE I KNEW HER, AND THEN IN 2012 OR 2010 OR WHENEVER IT WAS, I GOT INVOLVED IN POLITICS AND PLANNING ISSUES AND SHE STOOD OUT IN THE ROOM. SHE HAD HER BINDER AND HER OPINIONS AND I REALLY RESPECTED HER OPINIONS AND TO ME, SHE SEEMED LIKE SHE WAS ALMOST ALWAYS RIGHT AND IT WAS PROBABLY BECAUSE SHE KNEW SO MUCH ABOUT THE TOPIC. I WAS JUST REALLY PROUD TO CALL HER A SUPPORTER OF MINE AND A FRIEND AND I WAS PRETTY SHOCKED WHEN I HEARD ABOUT IT, LIKE MOST OF US WERE, I SUSPECT, AND I'M JUST HAPPY THAT I GOT TO KNOW HER AS BEST I COULD THESE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS AND I TRIED TO MAKE AN EFFORT AND SOME OF OUR COMMON FRIENDS TO TRY TO HELP HER TO STAY IN HER HOUSE, TO AGE IN PLACE, WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE SEEING A LOT MORE OF IN OUR COMMUNITY, BY PUTTING ON SOME -- REPLACING ROTTEN HANDRAILS AND STUFF SO SHE COULD GET UP AND DOWN THE STEPS SAFELY. I WAS HONORED TO HELP HER WITH THAT KIND OF THING AND REALLY DO WHAT I COULD TO PAY BACK FOR ALL SHE HAD DONE FOR THE COMMUNITY AND ALL THE LESSONS ABOUT HOW TO, YOU KNOW, KIND OF BE BRAVE WHEN YOU SPEAK ABOUT THINGS AND BE CONFIDENT IN HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT THINGS. AND THAT'S HOW EVERYONE REMEMBERS HER. I THANK EVERYONE FOR PUTTING THIS TOGETHER AND I THINK IN THE FUTURE, WE WILL FIND SOME INTEROPPORTUNITY THAT WILL BE APPROPRIATE TO NAME SOMETHING AFTER HER AND OUR CITY OR SOMETHING, JUST BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, SHE DEFINITELY WILL NOT BE FORGOTTEN, BUT IS DOESN'T HURT TO MEMORIALIZE THAT. THANK YOU FOR PUTTING THIS RESOLUTION TOGETHER. I'M VERY HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT.
04:45:56.048: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
04:45:57.582: >> Councilmember Bannister:  I WOULD LIKE TO REQUEST TO BE A COSIGNER TWO -- OR A COSPONSOR ALSO, AND I -- OF COURSE, I THINK WE'RE FORTUNATE TO HAVE, LUCKY TO HAVE ALL THE VIDEOS OF HER GIVING IMPARTING WORDS OF WISDOM ON US. AND JUST MARCH 28th RITA MITCHELL FORWARDED A REALLY GOOD MEMO FROM EPPIE ABOUT THE LOCATION OF THE TRAIN STATION, AND HER CONCLUSION WAS THAT AS A LIFETIME TRAIN ENJOYER, USER, SHE DIDN'T WANT TO SPEND HUGE MONIES FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION IN A PARK AWAY FROM THE CENTER OF THE CITY. SO I THOUGHT THAT WAS REALLY SWEET THAT IN HER LAST FEW DAYS, SHE WAS WRAPPING UP HER MEMOS AND SENDING OUT HER LAST FEW WORDS OF WISDOM TO TRY AND HELP THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. SO I REALLY APPRECIATE ALL YOU GUYS WORK AND SUPPORT ON -- TO RECOGNIZE A HUMANITARIAN LEADER OF HER TYPE. THANK YOU.
04:47:04.916: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? I'M SORRY. FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR. [CHORUS OF AYES] ALL OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. DC-6, RESOLUTION TO ENCOURAGE THE GOVERNOR TO ISSUE AN EXECUTIVE ORDER REGARDING NOMINATION PETITION. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER NELSON, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD. DISCUSSION OF DC-6? COUNCILMEMBER NELSON?
04:47:33.011: >> Councilmember Nelson: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. YEAH, I'M BRINGING THIS FORWARD BECAUSE WE DO HAVE A PROBLEM, IN THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL CANDIDATES THAT I KNOW OF WHO DON'T HAVE THEIR SIGNATURES YET, AND GIVEN THE CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE GOVERNOR FOR US ALL TO STAY IN, IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE FOR SOMEBODY TO BE KNOCKING ON DOORS A DOORS AND GG SIGNATURES. BASICALLY, WE HAD A DEADLINE OF APRIL 21st, BUT THAT DEADLINE WAS ARTIFICIALLY MOVED UP, SORT OF SUDDENLY AND UNEXPECTEDLY. AND I WAS HAPPY TO BRING THIS FORWARD, BECAUSE I KNOW THAT IN MY OWN CAMPAIGN, I DECIDED RATHER LATE ABOUT DECIDING TO RUN. AND SO I -- I THINK I GOT MY SIGNATURES IN JUST THREE OR FOUR OR FIVE DAYS MAYBE. AND IT WAS PRETTY LAST MINUTE.
04:48:28.900: >> Councilmember Bannister: ME TOO.
04:48:30.802: >> Councilmember Nelson:  SO THAT'S WHY I'M BRINGING THIS FORWARD. I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR FOR FOLKS TO HAVE THE REALLY TOUGH DECISION OF AM I GOING TO -- AM I GOING TO BE PUTTING PEOPLE AT RISK, PUTTING MY OWN HEALTH AT RISK TO MEET THIS DEEDLINE. WE HAVE NEED TO ASK THE GOVERNOR TO INTERVENE. IT'S REQUIRED THAT THE GOVERNOR INTERVENE. WE CAN'T DO THIS OURSELVES. WE CAN'T EXTEND THE DEADLINE OR MAKE SOME OTHER ARRANGEMENT LIKE PAYING A FEE INSTEAD OR SOMETHING. THIS RESOLUTION IS JUST ASKING THE GOVERNOR TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE'S AN OBSTACLE TO PEOPLE GETTING THE SIGNATURES AND OFFER US A SOLUTION SO SOMEONE CAN BE ON THE BALLOT WITHOUT VIOLATING RECOMMENDATIONS AROUND SOCIAL DISTANCING. THAT'S IT PRETTY MUCH.
04:49:18.316: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
04:49:19.484: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. APPRECIATE YOU HIGHLIGHTING THIS ISSUE THAT WE ARE HAVING. I DON'T KNOW IF ANYONE AT THE TABLE CAN HELP ME UNDERSTAND WHAT WE WOULD BE ASKING FOR, WHICH IT WOULD BE PUSH DEADLINE BACK, YOU KNOW, OR LOWERING THE SIGNATURE REQUIREMENT. WHAT -- WHAT TYPE OF RELIEF WE ARE QUICKLY APPROACH THE 15th, ONE WEEK. WHAT TYPE OF -- WHAT FORM WOULD THAT HELP COME IN? DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY IDEA?
04:50:03.094: >> City Atty. Postema: WE DON'T FULLY KNOW COUNCILMEMBER. WE ARE WATCHING IT CAREFULLY. I KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN AT LEAST INQUIRIES UP TO THE -- TO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY WILL BE PROPOSING, BUT THEY -- I THINK THEY DO KNOW WHAT THE CONCERNS ARE.
04:50:27.385: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: WHAT HAPPENS IF NOTHING IS CHANGED? NO ACTION IS TAKEN BY THE GOVERNOR? AND I KNOW I HAVE READ -- YOU KNOW, TO I -- I THINK IT'S FOR THE U.S. SENATE, IT'S SOMETHING YOU NEED LIKE 250,000 SIGNATURES OR SOMETHING. ASTONISHING. IF NOTHING IS TAKEN, WE FALL BACK IN PLACE OF WHAT IS CURRENTLY IN PLACE, CORRECT? PEOPLE WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO FILE FOR THE AUGUST PRIMARY; IS THAT CORRECT?
04:51:03.054: >> City Atty. Postema: WELL, I THINK WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW IS IF -- IT'S GOVERNED BY STATE LAW, WHICH ALSO TALKS ABOUT OUR CHARTER. THE TIMING FOR THE QUARTER, WHETHER THIS THEY WOULD PUSH THAT FORWARD OR A COMBINATION OF CHANGING TECHNOLOGY IN SOME WAY TO GET SIGNATURES, I DON'T KNOW. I BELIEVE THAT WITH YOUR RESOLUTION, YOU WANT A SOLUTION TO IT, AND THERE'S A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS THAT IT MIGHT BE DONE. SO IT'S NONSPECIFIC BECAUSE YOU WANT THE THINGS FIXED. MR. THOMAS, DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING MORE TO ADD? I THINK WE ARE ASKING THAT IT BE REMEDIED.
04:51:58.977: >> RIGHT. AND IF THERE'S NO ACTION TAKEN BY THE GOVERNOR, THEN IT WOULD JUST BE A STATUS QUO. THE DEADLINE WOULD BE THE DEADLINE AND THE SIGNATURE REQUIREMENT WOULD BE AS STATED IN THE CHARTER.
04:52:18.029: >> MAYOR?
04:52:19.431: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
04:52:19.931: >> I WAS JUST GOING TO REITERATE WHAT MATT THOMAS SAID, THE CURRENT DEADLINE UNDER ELECTION LAW IS APRIL 21st AND WE HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH THE BUREAU OF ELECTIONS, BUT AS OF RIGHT NOW, NO ACTION HAS BEEN TAKEN TO EXTEND IT OR ALLOW FOR A FILING FEE. SO TO ANSWER COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI'S QUESTION, RIGHT YOU NO THE DEADLINE IS APRIL 21st.
04:52:42.454: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. FURTHER DISCUSSION. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
04:52:49.961: >> Councilmember Hayner:  IT'S MY UNDERSTAND, THE STATE CANNOT CHANGE THE CHARTER BUT THEY CAN MOVE THE DEAD LINES, BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE IN CHARGE OF. A BIGGER CONCERN I HAD, AND I GUESS THIS QUESTION IS FOR MS. BEAUDRY, DO YOU IN THE CLERK'S OFFICE HAVE A CONCERN ABOUT POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS TO THIS THIS -- POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS THAT CANDIDATES MAY GET PETITIONS -- I HEARD IT FLOATED THAT --
04:53:32.904: >> YOU ARE ON MUTE.
04:53:36.374: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES, SOMETHING IS GOING IN. I HEARD THAT THEY COULD MAIL 125 COPIES THAT THEY KNOW PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO SIGN. WOULD THEY HANDLE THAT IN THAT TYPE OF VOLUME OR ARE THERE ANY CONSTRAINTS THAT THEY WOULD PUT ON THE COLLECTION OF THE PAPER BALLOTS OUT OF HEALTH CONCERNS?
04:53:55.727: >> Clerk Beaudry: WE ARE CURRENTLY TAKING APPOINTMENTS BECAUSE THE OFFICE IS CLOSED. BUT OVER THE LAST TWO WEEKS, I HAVE HAD FOUR OR FIVE PEOPLE COME IN AND FILE. SO THERE'S NO RESTRICTION ON FILING IF YOU COLLECT THE SIGNATURES. I WOULD JUST SAY THAT THE CIRCULATOR TECHNICALLY UNDER LAW IS REQUIRED TO SIGN THAT THEY WITNESSED THE SIGNATURE.
04:54:22.086: >> Councilmember Hayner: RIGHT.
04:54:23.688: >> Clerk Beaudry: OTHER THAN THAT, THERE'S NO RESTRICTIONS OF HOW MANY PIECES OF PAPER YOU TURN IN.
04:54:30.829: >> Councilmember Hayner:  SO THE NOTION THAT ONE MIGHT MAIL OR DEPOSIT AN ENVELOPE AND THEN COLLECT IT LATER WOULD VIOLATE THE IDEA OF THE ACTUAL WITNESS OF THE PEN-TO-PAPER?
04:54:42.173: >> Clerk Beaudry: CORRECT. WE HAD THIS COME UP IN THE PAST, WHERE YOU CAN'T LEAVE THEM IN A PUBLIC PLACE AND THEN GO PICK THEM UP LATER AND SIGN THAT YOU WERE THE CIRCULATOR.
04:54:50.648: >> Councilmember Hayner: SURE. OKAY. THANK YOU.
04:54:54.886: >> Clerk Beaudry: MM-HMM.
04:54:55.453: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
04:54:56.921: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER NELSON AND GRISWOLD FOR SPONSORING THIS. THIS IS TIME SENSITIVE AND I ALSO APPRECIATE YOUR HELPFUL SUMMARY OF WHY YOU ARE BRINGING THIS FORWARD. COUNCILMEMBER NELSON, I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR REACHING OUT TO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND EXPRESS INTEREST TO CONVEY THIS TO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AS SOON AS THIS IS ADOPTED, IF THIS IS ADOPTED. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK MS. BEAUDRY FOR THE LEADERSHIP OPEN THIS MAT -- ON THIS MATTER AND HAS BEEN WORKING WITH THE BOARD OF ELECTION AND THE STATE'S OFFICE AND THE CLERKS ACROSS STATE TO RESOLVE THIS MATTER. I DO THINK THAT OUR CHARTER, WHEN THIS PROVISION WAS WAS WRITTEN AND APPROVED BY THE ELECTORATE. THAT WAS 65 YEARS AGO AND AT THE TIME, NO ONE WAS IMAGINING, AND IT'S SHUT DOWN AND AS IT STANDS NOW, WE WILL BE REQUIRING THEM DO SOMETHING, IN ORDER TO RUN AND SERVE. THAT'S ILLEGAL GIVEN THE CURRENT EXECUTIVE ORDER. AND SO HOPEFULLY THIS WILL MOVE THE NEEDLE FOR THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND THE STATE TO LOOK AT OPTIONS OTHER THAN JUST MOVING THE -- POTENTIALLY MOVING THE DEADLINE. I MEAN, REALLY, THAT'S THROWING DARTS ON THE DART BOARD AT THIS POINT IN TIME, AND WE NEED SOME VIABLE OPTIONS. THE ISSUE HAS JUST BEEN NOTED WITH POTENTIALLY MAILING OUR PETITIONS INDIVIDUALLY TO PEOPLE. I KNOW RIGHT NOW THERE'S EVEN DISCUSSION ABOUT POTENTIAL CURTAILING OF MAIL SERVERS. AND TECHNOLOGICALLY, THERE ARE A LOT OF UNKNOWNS. I'M VERY HOPEFUL THAT OUR CITY WILL ALSO -- THE ATTORNEY'S OFFICE WILL LOOK AT OPTIONS IN TERMS OF OUR CHARTER AND THE PROVISIONS THAT ARE REQUIRED. AND KNOWING THAT IT WILL REQUIRE A CHANGE IN STATE STATUTE. GIVEN THE CONSTRAINTS WERE FACING. SO THANK YOU ALL FOR WORKING ON THIS.
04:58:01.406: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER. THEN PERHAPS YOU CAN MOVE TO A VOTE ON THIS.
04:58:04.208: >> Councilmember Bannister: OKAY. WELL, I'M JUST -- I'M LOOKING AT SOME OF THE PAPERWORK THAT IF WE DO HAVE TO GET THE SIGNATURES, THEN I'M GOING TO HAVE TO FIND A XEROX MACHINE THAT'S OPEN TO MAKE THESE LEGAL SIZE, BUT I WANT TO SAY I CAN SEND ONE COPY TO A WHOLE BUNCH OF PEOPLE, AND THEN THEY CAN SIGN AS THEIR OWN CIRCULATOR, SO THEY CAN SIGN THEIR NAME UP HERE AND WE CAN SIGN AS THEIR OWN CIRCULATOR AND THEN MAIL IT BACK TO ME, BUT THAT'S -- BUT THAT'S NOT THE IDEAL PLAN, AND HOPEFULLY THERE WON'T BE ANY GERMS ON ALL OF THAT AS IT GETS CIRCULATED AND THAT THE POST OFFICE KEEPS DELIVERING. SO I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE I WOULD GET THE XEROX COPY OF A LEGAL SIZE AT THIS POINT.
04:58:59.764: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION?
04:59:02.533: >> Councilmember Hayner: FEDEX KINKO'S IS STILL OPEN.
04:59:06.437: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] ALL OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. DO WE HAVE COMMUNICATIONS TODAY FROM OUR CITY ATTORNEY?
04:59:17.949: >> City Atty. Postema: I DO HAVE SOMETHING, MAYOR. I DIDN'T SPEAK WHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT -- ALL TALKED ABOUT EPPIE POTTS BECAUSE I USUALLY DON'T TALK ABOUT COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS, BUT SOME OF YOU KNOW, BUT NOT EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT EPPIE WAS MY FRIEND AND NEIGHBOR FOR 32 YEARS. IF YOU LOOK RIGHT OUT MY BACK DOOR, AND GO DOWN THE STEPS, OUR BACKYARDS ARE ADJACENT AND WE SPENT A LONG TIME TALKING OVER THE BACK -- WELL, SORT OF A GARDEN FENCE. AND, YOU KNOW, WE'RE IN THE MIDST OF SOCIAL DISTANCING NOW AND I WILL SAY THAT EPPIE POTTS -- THERE WHEREAS NO SOCIAL DISTANCE BETWEEN THE POSTEMAS AND EPPIE POTTS. AND THAT EVEN BECAME MORE TRUE. SHE WAS VERY GOOD TO OUR FAMILY, AND WHEN I BECAME CITY ATTORNEY, INCREASED HER TRIPS TO THE POSTEMA FAMILY, ESPECIALLY IF THERE WERE DEVELOPMENTS THAT WERE COMING ON TO THE AGENDA. I WOULD FIND LITTLE ARTICLES ON MY FRONT PORCH. I WOULD FIND THEM PASTED TO MY DOOR. SHE WOULD COME OVER AT ANY TIME AND SHE WAS WELCOMED TO COME OVER. AND, YES, SHE DID BEND MY EAR PROBABLY MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE IN THE CITY REGARDING DEVELOPMENT. AND I TREASURED MY DISCUSSIONS WITH HER. I MISS HER. SHE HAS BEEN AWAY FROM HER HOME FOR A WHILE, AND THE LIGHTS ARE OFF IN HER HOUSE, AND THAT -- THAT'S SAD TO ME TODAY. BUT I DO THINK THAT AT 95 YEARS, SHE HAD AN EXCELLENT RUN IN THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU WATCH PEOPLE THROUGH THE BACKDOOR, WE COULD SORT OF SEE OUT THERE AND ON OUR PORCH AND TALK. I JUST WANTED TO TELL YOU THAT BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE EVERYBODY ON THE COUNCIL EVEN KNEW THAT WE WERE NEIGHBORS FOR 32 YEARS. SO THANK YOU.
05:01:31.616: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. WE HAVE BEFORE US THE CLERK'S REPORT OF COMMUNICATIONS, PETITIONS AND REFERSALS. MAY I HAVE A MOTION TO APPROVE THE CLERK'S REPORT. MOVED BY ACKERMAN, SECONDED BY NELSON. DISCUSSION OF THE CLERK'S REPORT? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] ALL OPPOSED? THE CLERK'S REPORT IS APPROVED. ARE THERE ANY -- WE NOW COME TO PUBLIC COMMENT GENERAL TIME. PUBLIC COMMENT GENERAL TIME IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO SPEAK TO COUNCIL AND THE COMMUNITY, ABOUT MATTERS OF MUNICIPAL INTERESTS. TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT GENERAL TIME, ONE NEED NOT SIGN UP IN ADVANCE. SPEAKERS HAVE THREE MINUTES. MS. BEAUDRY, HOW MANY FOLKS ARE ON THE LINE.
05:02:12.623: >> Clerk Beaudry: RIGHT NOW, IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE WE HAVE ANYONE WAITING.
05:02:18.763: >> Mayor Taylor: SPEAKERS HAVE THREE MINUTES TO TALK. AND THE CLERK WILL IDENTIFY 30 SECONDS. CALLERS WILL CALL THE PHONE NUMBER IN THE MEETING ID ON YOUR SCREENS TO DIAL IN. CALLERS WILL BE CALLED UPON ONE AT A TIME BY THE CITY CLERK, USING LAST THREE DIGITS OF YOUR PHONE NUMBER. YOU WILL HEAR AN AUTOMATED ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE HOST IS ALLOWING YOU TO SPEAK AND THEN YOU WILL SPEAK. PLEASE MOVE TO A QUIET AREA AND MUTE ANY TELEVISION OR BACKGROUND NOISE. IF YOU ARE NEW TO SPEAKING AT CITY COUNCIL, PUB I CAN LICK COMMENT IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE COMMENTS TO COUNCIL, CITY COUNCIL LISTENS BUT NOT RESPOND. IS THERE ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT?
05:03:03.274: >> Clerk Beaudry: THERE'S NO ONE IN THE WAITING ROOM.
05:03:05.576: >> Mayor Taylor: SEEING NO ONE, THE PUBLIC COMMENT IS CLOSED. THERE ARE COMMUNICATIONS TODAY FROM COUNCIL? COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN?
05:03:11.816: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANKS, MR. MAYOR. I WANTED TO MAKE A COMMENT. I THINK -- YOU KNOW, I THINK THERE'S SOME CONCERN FROM COLLEAGUES THAT -- THAT THE PHYSICAL DISTANCING AND THE ABILITY TO DO PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT, COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT ARE INCOMPATIBLE. I WANT US TO CHALLENGE YOU ARESELVES IN THIS TIME THAT THIS MAY BE AN EVEN BETTER OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO ENGAGE OUR CONSTITUENTS AND THE RESIDENTS OF THE CITY. PEOPLE HAVE -- FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A LONG TIME, ON SOME BALANCE, EITHER FORCED UPON THEM OR INTRODUCED TO THEM, THAT GIVES THEM OPPORTUNITY TO LEAN INTO THEIR COMMUNITY AND PROVIDE FEEDBACK. THE ABILITY TO DO REMOTE MEETINGS MEANS THAT PARENTS WITH YOUNG CHILDREN CAN JOIN MEETINGS AFTER THEY PUT KIDS DOWN AND CAN ENGAGE IN A WAY THAT THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO IN A PHYSICAL SPACE LIKE CITY HALL. YOU KNOW, I CAN SPEAK WITH CONFIDENCE NOW HAVING DONE A LITTLE MINI TOWN HALL ON FRIDAY EVENING THAT GOT 40 PARTICIPANTS RANGING IN AGE FROM THEIR 20s TO THEIR 70s. ALL OF WHOM SEE TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THE TECHNOLOGY, AND SPENT THEIR FRIDAY NIGHT WITH ME. AND SO, YOU KNOW, I REALLY DO WANT US TO CHALLENGE OURSELVES TO LEAN INTO THAT TECHNOLOGY, TO USE IT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO REACH MORE PEOPLE AND GIVE THEM MORE INPUT ON POLICIES THAT WOULD MAKE PEOPLE'S LIVES BETTER AND NOT RUN AWAY FROM IT.
05:04:41.071: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND?
05:04:44.074: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. ONE OF THE THINGS I DIDN'T GET TO SPEAK TO, BECAUSE THE DISCUSSION WAS ABRUPTLY CUT OFF, WHICH I THINK IS UNFORTUNATE GIVEN THE LEVEL OF PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT AND OUTREACH WE HAD IN SUPPORT OF THIS. I JUST WANTED TO TAKE A MINUTE. I KNOW IT'S LATE, BUT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF PEJORATIVE LANGUAGE AROUND CERTAIN KINDS OF ADVOCATES AND ADVOCACY GROUPS. AND I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT AT LEAST FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, THERE ARE AI LOT OF GROUPS WHO ARE REALLY ENGAGED IN SUBSTANTIVE COMMUNIY DISCUSSION. AND JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE THEIR MESSAGE DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEIR ADVOCACY IS NOT VALUABLE AND THAT IT SHOULDN'T BE COUNTED AS MUCH AS OTHERS. SO I JUST WANT TO SAY TO THOSE ADVOCATES ESPECIALLY AROUND THE ISSUES OF HOUSING AND SUSTAINABILITY, THAT I HEAR YOU. I APPRECIATE YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE DISCUSSION, AND PLEASE CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE.
05:05:49.640: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER?
05:05:50.207: >> Councilme
05:05:53.377: >> Clerk Beaudry: MAYOR. IT APPEARS THAT CTN DID NOT PUBLISH THE PHONE NUMBER WHEN YOU CALLED FOR PUBLIC COMMENT AND THERE IS ONE PERSON IN THE QUEUE NOW.
05:06:02.353: >> Mayor Taylor: IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT CTN DID NOT PUBLISH THE PHONE NUMBER AND NO SHAME -- NO SHAME TO THEM OR SHAME TO THEM FOR THAT. WITH COUNCIL'S ACQUIESCENCE, LET'S ROLL WITH THAT PUBLIC COMMENT. SEEING NO OBJECTION, IS THERE ANYONE WHO -- WE HAVE ONE SPACE FOR PUBLIC COMMENT.
05:06:28.579: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER 326.
05:06:29.213: >> HI. SO THIS IS JAMIE McGARRETT. OBVIOUSLY, I'M DISAPPOINTED ABOUT DC-2, BUT I WANTED TO INSTEAD FOCUS ON THE FACT THAT I DO APPRECIATE THAT COUNCIL HAS PUT SO MUCH EFFORT INTO DOING YOUR MEETING ONLINE, AND PROVIDING OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH YOU. YOU DID A GREAT JOB TONIGHT, AND I APPRECIATE ALL OF YOUR EFFORTS IN THAT REGARD. AND I'M ALSO VERY HAPPY TO SEE THAT YOU ALL SEEM TO BE IN RELATIVELY GOOD HEALTH, AND HAVE MANAGED TO STAY IN GOOD HEALTH AND WELL BEING THROUGHOUT THIS CRISIS. SO I WISH YOU A GREAT NIGHT AND, AGAIN THANK YOU FOR ALL OF YOUR HARD WORK.
05:07:08.652: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT? CLERK MAYOR, THE NUMBER WAS PUBLISHED, AND THAT IS THE ONLY CALLER NOW.
05:07:20.364: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SEEING NO ONE, PUBLIC COMMENT IS CLOSED AGAIN. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO -- ANY OTHER COUNCIL COMMUNICATION? MY APOLOGIES? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
05:07:32.343: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANKS. I MEAN, I'M NOT SURE IF THERE'S ANYBODY OUT THERE IN VIEWERLAND RIGHT NOW BUT I JUST WANT TO STRESS THE IMPORTANCE THAT -- OF SOCIAL DISTANCING AND MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE -- WE CONTINUE TO BE VIGILANT AS WE GET THROUGH THIS REALLY TOUGH TIME. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. IT'S MUCH AS POSSIBLE TO GET COMMUNICATION OUT THERE. I KNOW WE ARE GETTING COMMUNICATION FROM THE COUNTY AND THE STATE, AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS AND THANK YOU, MAYOR, FOR FORWARDING THE -- THOSE COMMUNICATIONS TO US ON A DAILY BASIS. BUT AS WE GO FORWARD AND WE START HAVING SOME POLICY CHANGES HERE LOCALLY, I WOULD JUST ADVOCATE FOR MORE OF A COHESIVE MESSAGE THAT CAN BE SENT OUT TO FOLKS WHEN IT COMES TO OUR LOCAL PARKS OR OUR LOCAL PARKING. THESE KIND OF THINGS THAT THE POLICY CHANGES THAT WE NEED TO TAKE, HOPEFULLY THINGS KIND OF LOW DOWN WHERE THEY ARE NOT CHANGING MICHANGING MINUTE BY M. WE CAN BECOME BETTER LETTING FOLKS KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON, AS BEST AS POSSIBLE. I KNOW IT'S BEEN TOUGH ON EVERYBODY. I APPRECIATE OUR LAST PUB I CAN THERE COMMENTER, YOU KNOW, LOOKING HE IT BIG PICTURE AS WE ARGUE ABOUT POLICY AS OFTEN AS WE DO. WE ARE ALSO IN GOOD HEALTH AND HOPEFULLY, THAT REMAINS THE CASE AND HAD HOPEFULLY THIS COMMUNITY COMES OUT ON TOP WHEN THIS IS ALL OVER BECAUSE OF THE VIGILANCE AND THE PRACTICE THAT -- AND THE SACRIFICES THAT WE'RE MAKING RIGHT NOW.
05:09:30.027: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
05:09:31.328: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. YEAH, I -- YOU KNOW, I SHARED THE CALLER'S DISAPPOINTMENT THAT I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN GOOD TO HAVE I ACONVERSATION AROUND THIS TRANSIT-ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT. I DON'T THINK THAT -- THE RESOLUTION SO THAT FOOD BEFORE US, THE ONE I BROUGHT FOR US. IT ACTUALLY REQUIRED A LITTLE BIT MORE AND SO I -- YOU KNOW, I HOPE THAT WE WILL REVISIT THAT SOON AND I WILL DO WHAT I CAN HOPEFULLY USING THESE TOOLS THAT I'M GETTING MORE USED TO THE ZOOM AND THIS, WHICH I CONTINUE TO HAVE PUBLIC MEETINGS. I HAVE A COUPLE OF MEETINGS THAT GOT POSTPONED ON THE CRUX OF HAVING THEM, ONE ABOUT THE TINY HOUSES MOVEMENT AND ANOTHER ABOUT THE HOMELESS CONSIDERATIONS GENERALLY HERE IN ANN ARBOR. AND SO I'M HOPING TO REORGANIZE THOSE AROUND THE PUBLIC ZOOM SOFTWARE THAT WE HAVE NOW. AND AS FAR AS THE COVID-19 GOES, YOU KNOW, I -- IF I WAS SITTING DOWN THERE AT COUNCIL, I WOULD BE WEARING A MASK AND MY GLOVES. AND I'M A BIT PARANOID ABOUT THIS WHOLE THING AND I'M AN EARLY ADOPTER OF MASK WEARING. I ENCOURAGE OUR RESIDENTS TO BE VIGILANT WITH THEIR DOINGS AND HABITS AT THIS TIME. I MAKE CLEANING ROUNDS AT OUR HOUSE. WE PRETTY MUCH HAVE BEEN
