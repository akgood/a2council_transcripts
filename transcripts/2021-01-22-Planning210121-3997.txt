00:01:41.854: >> Planning Manager: ABSOLUTELY. [ ROLL CALL ]
00:02:01.006: >> Planning Manager:  WE HAVE A QUORUM. WE HAVE SEVEN MEMBERS PRESENT. JUST A NOTE OR REMINDER FOR THE PLANNING COMMISSION AND PETITIONERS, SIX AFFIRMATIVE VOTES ARE REQUIRED TO A V ADVANA PETITION WITH AN AFFIRMATIVE.
00:02:15.220: >> Chair Mills: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ITEM THREE IS INTRODUCTIONS. IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE WE HAVE ANY. ALL RIGHT, WE ARE ON ITEM 4 WHICH IS THE APPROVAL OF THE AGENDA. MOVED BY COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN, SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL S. THERE ANY DISCUSSION OF THE MOTION? ANY CHANGES? ALL RIGHT. ALL IN FAVOR OF THE MOTION, PLEASE SAY AYE OR RAISE YOUR HAND. AYE. [CHORUS OF AYES]
00:02:45.050: >> Chair Mills: EXCELLENT. I THINK I HEARD EVERYONE. THE MOTION CARRIES. ITEM NUMBER FIVE IS THE MINUTES OF THE PREVIOUS AGENDA. MAY I HAVE A MOTION TO APPROVE THE MINUTES OF THE JANUA JANUARY 5th, 2020 MEETING. MOVED BY COMMISSIONER DISCH AND SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT. ARE THERE ANY DISCUSSIONS OR CORRECTIONS? ALL IN FAVOR OF THE MINUTES AS DRAFTED, PLEASE SAY AYE OR RAISE YOUR HAND. [CHORUS OF AYES] I SAW ALL HANDS. THE MOTION CARRIES. WE'RE ALREADY UP TO ITEM SIX, WHICH IS REPORTS FROM CITY ADMINISTRATION, CITY COUNCIL, THE PLANNING MANAGER, PLANNING COMMISSION OFFICERS AND COMMITTEES AND WRITTEN COMMUNICATIONS. COUNCILMEMBER DISCH, DO YOU HAVE ANY REPORT FOR US?
00:03:29.695: >> Councilmember Disch: YES, I DO. IT WAS A BUSY NIGHT ON COUNCIL ON TUESDAY. IT WENT LONG INTO THE MORNING. BUT THE GREAT NEWS IS THAT WE HAD FINAL PASSAGE OF THE FLOODPLAIN ORDINANCE WHICH WAS JUST ON THE CONSENT AGENDA. IT WAS JUST... AND FINAL PASSAGE OF THE EV ORDINANCE, WHICH IS SUCH GREAT NEWS. AND I THINK THIS IS OF INTEREST TO PLANNING, WE PASSED A RESOLUTION TO RESCIND THAT ROAD RECONFIGURATIONS COME BEFORE COUNCIL. SO THAT MIGHT BE -- I GUESS YOU DON'T REALLY DO THOSE OR WE DON'T DO THOSE. WE ALSO PASSED A NUMBER EVER AMENDMENTS TO THE UDC, WHICH MOSTLY LOOK LIKE CORRECTIONS WHERE IT HAD NOT BEEN UPDATED OR PROPERLY UPDATED TO REFLECT PREVIOUSLY ADOPTED ORDINANCES BUT THEN THERE WERE SOME NEW ADDITIONS WHICH CAME OUT OF PLANNING, WHICH THE RIGHT-OF-WAY DEDICATION FOR PUBLIC SIDEWALKS TO BE COUNTED TOWARD THE CALCULATION. AND REDUCTION OF FIBER CEMENT BOARD WHICH I ASSUME ALEX HIMSELF AUTHORED THAT ONE. AND THE PROVISION THAT WE PASSED A FEW WEEKS AGO, REGARDING TEMPORARY CERTIFICATES OF OCCUPANCY, WHEN THERE'S JUST SOMETHING LIKE BIKE RACKS THAT NEED TO BE FINISHED OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. AND THERE'S A REQUEST FROM COUNCIL THAT WE ARE ALREADY SET UP TO DO, WHICH IS COUNCIL WOULD LIKE PC TO CONFIRM ITS APPOINTMENT TO THE COUNCIL OF COMMONS. I BELIEVE THAT'S ALL.
00:05:08.293: >> Chair Mills: THAT'S THE VERY LAST ITEM ON OUR AGENDA, AND WE'LL LOOK AT THE ASSIGNMENTS TO COMMITTEE AND COUNCIL. MR. LENART, DO YOU HAVE A REPORT FOR US?
00:05:15.467: >> Planning Manager:  YES, JUST TO TACK ON TO COMMISSIONER DISCH'S REPORT, TO CLARIFY THAT FLOODPLAIN ORDINANCE WAS ACTUALLY -- IT'S CALLED SUMMARY PUBLICATION. IT'S SORT OF A FORMALITY AFTER THE PREVIOUS ADOPTION OF THE ORDINANCE THAT ALLOWS IT TO BE ADOPTED IN SUMMARY, RATHER THAN THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF WORDS. SO IT REFERENCES THAT ACTION, THE FLOODPLAIN ORDINANCE WAS ADOPTED PREVIOUSLY. YOU WILL SEE A SIMILAR CONVENTION HAPPEN WITH THE RECENTLY ADOPTED E.V. ORDINANCE AND THE CHARLIE BATCH OF E.V. AMENDMENTS THAT COMMISSIONER DISCH REFERENCED. DUE TO SOME SCHEDULING SNAFUS, I.E., MISTAKE ON ME AND MY TEAM'S PART, WE DID HAVE POSTPONE ACTION ON THE REZONING OF 2111 PACKARD ON ELLSWORTH. THAT WAS TO LET THEM TO BE CONSIDERED ON THE SAME AGENDA FEBRUARY 1st. AND THEN A COUPLE OF QUICK UPDATES, OR THE ORDINANCE REVISION COMMITTEE MEETING LATER -- OR NEXT WEEK, WE ANTICIPATE DIVING A LITTLE BIT FURTHER INTO THE PROPOSED -- THE DRAFT TRANSIT ZONING DISTRICT, AND STARTING CONVERSATION ABOUT SITE PLAN REVIEW THRESHOLDS THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED. AND THEN AS A REMINDER, WE WILL BE WORKING TOWARDS OUR FEBRUARY WORKING SESSION AS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT ON PROPOSED CHANGES TO THE A.D.U. ORDINANCE AND PROPOSED TRANSIT ZONING. SO MORE TO COME ON THAT, BUT JUST A REMINDER THAT THAT WILL BE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT FORMAT MEETING THAN YOU ARE PROBABLY TYPICALLY ACCUSTOMED TO. AND THAT'S ALL.
00:06:56.134: >> VERY GOOD. THANK YOU. DO ANY OTHER COMMISSIONERS, OFFICERS OR COMMITTEE LIAISONS HAVE ANYTHING TO REPORT OUT? I WILL JUST NOTE FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DIDN'T CALL IN TO THE WORKING SESSION LAST WEEK, THAT WE HAD ONE KIND OF MEETING WITH -- FOR A P.U.D., BUT THERE WAS A PORTION THAT BAZ RECORDED -- WAS RECORDED. THERE WAS A PORTION THAT WAS RECORDED BY THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN FACULTY MEMBERS, WHO TOLD US ABOUT RACIALLY EXCLUSIONARY DEED RESTRICTIONS IN THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. THAT WE DID RECORD AND IT'S NOW AVAILABLE ONLINE. IT -- FROM KIND OF A YOUTUBE THING. MR. LENART, THAT'S -- IF YOU GO TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION WEBSITE; IS THAT RIGHT? OH, YOU ARE ON MUTE. SORRY.
00:07:54.359: >> Planning Manager:  DOLLAR IN THE JAR. IT'S NOT LINKED ON OUR WEBSITE, BUT IT WILL BE BY THE END OF THE WEEK. WE ARE ALSO ANTICIPATING TO POST A FEW OTHER RESOURCES THAT WERE MENTIONED, INCLUDING WASHTENAW COUNTY'S OPPORTUNITY INDEX MAP. SO I WILL SEND A FOLLOW-UP TO PLANNING COMMISSION ONCE THOSE THINGS ARE AVAILABLE. AND WE COULD ALSO SEND OUT A PLANNING UPDATE DELIVERY NOTICE AS WELL. BUT AS MENTIONED, IT IS AVAILABLE ON YOUTUBE. IF ANYBODY HAS -- IS INTERESTED IN THAT PRIOR TO THAT, FEEL FREE TO EMAIL US AT PLANNING@A2GOV.O. WE CAN GET THAT LINK OUT REALLY QUICKLY.
00:08:35.133: >> Chair MillsLENT. WILL NOTEHAT WE WILL -- EXCEENT. I WL NOTE THAT WE WILL TALK ABOUT TH A LITTLE BIT LATER PLAN FOR THIS YEAR TO BE LOOKI AT KIND OF THE HISTORY OF ZING IN T CITY, SINGLFAMILY OF INTERSECTIO WITH RACIA UITY AND AEROOALS, THAS ONE OF THE EDUCAONAL SECTION WE A -- ONEF THE TNGS THA WE WIL TALKBOUT LATER ON AS REFORMINTHOSE SUBCOMTTEES IS A GRPO HEL KIND OF AND SO THIS IS -- THIS IS PART OF THAT. AND I THOUGHT OUR KIND OF DISCUSSION AT THE END ABOUT WHAT FUTURE STEPS MIGHT BE OR OTHER THINGS THAT WE COULD LOOK AT WILL HELP INFORM SOME OF THAT AS WELL. COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL. SORRY.
00:09:16.942: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: I JUST HAVE A QUICK QUESTION FOR MR. LENART. IS -- DID I HEAR YOU SAY THAT THE MAP WOULD BE A SEPARATE THING?
00:09:25.717: >> Planning Manager:  YES, THERE'S --
00:09:29.221: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: THAT'S GREAT.
00:09:30.188: >> Planning Manager:  THERE WAS SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT SOME OVERLAYING, BUT AT THIS TIME -- WE HAVEN'T TAKEN ANY OF THOSE STEPS. THAT RESEARCH IS STILL IN THE HANDS OF THOSE RESEARCHERS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN. HOWEVER, THE WISH  WASHTENAW COY HAS PUT TO GO OPPORTUNITY WASHTENAW. THAT'S AN EXISTING RESOURCE WHERE YOU CAN LOOK AT DEMOGRAPHICS, INCOME, HEALTH, AND A LOT OF DIFFERENT INDICES AND SEE HOW THERE ARE DIFFERENTIALS ACROSS THE COUNTY. SO I THINK MY INTENTION OF POSTING THAT LINK IS THAT WHILE I THINK THAT THE COUNTY IS IN THE PROCESS OF DOING SOME UPDATES TO THAT, WHICH MAY BE REALLY SOON, EVEN IN THE MEANTIME, THAT'S A GREAT RESOURCE TO -- FOR PEOPLE TO EXPLORE SOME OF THE TYPES OF OVERLAYS THAT WAS DISCUSSED IN OUR SESSION.
00:10:20.739: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: I WOULD ALSO ENCOURAGE YOU TO ASK FOR -- AS PART OF THE POWERPOINT THING, 9 MAP THAT THEY SHOWED WAS KIND OF DIFFICULT AND A LITTLE FUZZY TO READ, BECAUSE IT WAS ALL SCRUNCHED UP AND ON THE SMALL SCREEN. I KNOW IT'S IN PROCESS AND THAT TYPE OF THING. WOULD BE GREAT IF WE COULD GET THAT AS A SEPARATE FILE, SO THAT PEOPLE COULD LOOK AT IT MORE CLOSELY. I JUST NOTICED I COULDN'T READ ANY OF THE LEGEND VERY EASILY AND STUFF LIKE THAT. SO THAT WOULD BE GREAT IF YOU COULD ASK THEM FOR THAT AS A SEPARATE PIECE SO THAT WE COULD -- BECAUSE I THINK PEOPLE ARE CURIOUS AND WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO ZOOM IN MORE EASILY AS PART OF A PRESENTATION THAT'S IN THE MIDDLE OF A -- YOU KNOW, OF A VIDEO.
00:11:04.349: >> Planning Manager:  YES, I WILL FOLLOW UP AND ASK. I KNOW THAT'S SORT OF THE NEXT PHASE IS FINDING A WAY TO HOST THAT INFORMATION SO IT IS ACCESSIBLE.
00:11:13.058: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: YEAH.
00:11:14.893: >> Planning Manager:  I WILL ASK FOR THE BEST THAT WE CAN GET IN THE INTERIM.
00:11:18.063: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: THANK YOU.
00:11:19.865: >> Chair Mills: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NO OTHER UPDATES FROM COMMISSIONER OFFICERS? OH, YES, COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL?
00:11:27.005: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: I WOULD JUST SAY, JUST ONE TID BIT THAT CAME OUT OF THE D.D.A. PARTNERS MEETING THAT MIGHT BE INTERESTING FOR THIS GROUP IS THAT THE AAATA IS STILL NOT OPERATING AT FULL CAPACITY BUT THEY HOPE TO BE BY AUGUST. SO JUST IN TERMS OF US KIND OF UNDERSTANDING THAT. I MEAN, IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MAKE A DIFFERENCE TORE SITE PLANS BUT I THINK AS WE'RE -- FOR SITE PLANS, BUT I THINK AS WE ARE MAKING A LOT OF DECISIONS, AROUND A2ZERO AND ALL KINDS OF THINGS AROUND TRANSPORTATION, THAT IT'S HELPFUL FOR US TO UNDERSTAND WHERE THEY ARE WITH THINGS AND THE KIND OF TOLL THAT IT'S TAKEN ON THEM, AND THAT -- THE AIR RIDE IS STILL DOWN TOO, IN TERMS OF GETTING TO THE AIRPORT. AND THAT THEY HAD A REALLY WONDERFUL GRANT THAT THEY GOT THAT WAS LOOKING AT -- OR THAT WAS A BUS THAT WAS GOING BACK AND FORTH TO DETROIT AND THEY ARE HOPING THAT THAT MAY START UP IN NOT TO TOO, TOO LONG. THAT ALSO GOT SHUT DOWN. JUST SO YOU ALL KNOW, THOSE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON THAT MIGHT APPLY TO WHAT WE ARE THINKING ABOUT.
00:12:28.800: >> Chair Mills: THANK YOU. LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL. AS VACCINES COME OUT. ALL RIGHT. MOVING ON TO ITEM NUMBER 7, THIS IS AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PERSONS TO SPEAK UP FOR UP TO THREE MINUTES ABOUT AN ISSUE THAT'S NOT LISTED AS A PUBLIC HEARING ON THIS AGENDA. SO THE PUBLIC HEARINGS THAT WE HAVE TONIGHT OR FOR THE 300 SOUTH MAPLE PROJECT, OR -- AND WE ALSO HAVE A PUBLIC HEARING FOR THE PLANNED PROJECT SITE PLAN MODIFICATIONS. IF YOU HAVE ANY OTHER MATTERS YOU WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS PLANNING COMMISSION ON, YOU CAN CALL 877-853-5247. AND THEN ENTER MEETING I.D. 99151611348. CITY STAFF WILL SELECT CALLERS THAT HAVE RAISED THEIR HAND, CALLING UPON YOU BY THE LAST THREE DIGITS OF YOUR TELEPHONE NUMBER. YOU RAISE YOUR HAND BY PRESSING STAR NINE ON YOUR TELEPHONE. YOU WILL HEAR AN AUTOMATED ANNOUNCEMENT WHEN THE HOST HAS ALLOWED TO YOU SPEAK. ONCE YOU ARE KIND OF ALLOWED TO SPEAK, YOU MAY NEED TO PRESS STAR SIX ON YOUR PHONE TO UNMUTE IT, BUT PLEASE MOVE TO A QUIET AREA AND MUTE ANY BACKGROUND SOUND SO THAT WE CAN HEAR YOU CLEARLY. PLEASE ALSO STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS AT THE BEGINNING OF YOUR COMMENTS. SO IF ANY OF THE CALLERS ON THE LINE WANT TO SPEAK ON AN ISSUE THAT IS NOT PUBLIC HEARING TONIGHT, YOU CAN PRESS STAR NINE RIGHT NOW TO RAISE YOUR HAND.
00:14:06.564: >> Planning Manager:  CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 534. CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 534. YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
00:14:17.942: >> GOOD EVENING. THIS IS TOM STULBERG. I AM EXCITED ABOUT AN ITEM THAT HAS A PUBLIC HEARING LATER ON, BUT I WON'T TALK ABOUT THAT. THAT'S THE PLANNED PROJECT MODIFICATION REPLACEMENT. I HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THAT FOR QUITE SOMETIME. I'M EXCITED ABOUT THE FLOODPLAIN ORDINANCE MOVING FORWARD, ABOUT THE E.V. ORDINANCE, AND THAT YOU WILL BE DISCUSSING TRANSIT SUPPORT DEVELOPMENT PRETTY SOON. ALSO, IN THE U.D.C. AMENDMENTS THAT COUNCIL JUST APPROVED, I'M HAPPY THAT THE ONE ITEM IN PARTICULAR, ABOUT THE A.D.U.s BEING EXTENDED INTO THE R2A ZONING CATEGORY. I HAVE BEEN WATCHING THAT AND I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT THAT HAPPENED. I ALSO HEAR THAT YOU WILL BE TALKING ABOUT A.D.U.s AGAIN IN THE NEAR FUTURE. AND I WANT TO REMIND EVERYBODY ABOUT HOW PROBLEMATIC THE LAST PROCESS WAS, INCLUDING STARTING WITH WHAT WAS REALLY AN UNOFFICIAL PROCESS BY THE D.D.A. MEMBER ACTING ON HER PRIVATE BEHALF, THAT SHE DID END UP ADMITTING TO, THAT ENDED UP BECOMING A REPORT THAT ENDED UP BECOMING OFFICIALLY ADOPTED BY COUNCIL, THAT ENDED UP BEING THE MAJOR KEY THAT SOME ORDINANCE REVISIONS THAT WERE OVERREACHING WERE PROPOSED, AND DESPITE SOME WARNINGS FROM SOME CITIZENS THAT WERE PAYING ATTENTION, IT WAS BROUGHT TO COUNCIL TO EFFECTIVELY ELIMINATE SINGLE-FAMILY ZONING FOR 19,000 HOUSEHOLDS WITH PROBABLY 99.9% OF THOSE 19,000 HOUSEHOLDS BEING COMPLETELY UNAWARE OF WHAT WAS ABOUT TO HAPPEN TO THEM, THAT THEIR NEIGHBORS WOULD HAVE A BUY RIGHT ABILITY TO BUILD AN 800 SQUARE FOOT DETACHED UNIT IN THE REAR SETBACK OF SINGLE FAMILY ZONED RESIDENTS. SO IT'S 19,000 PEOPLE WHO DID NOT KNOW, OF RESIDENCES, NOT JUST PEOPLE. THAT WAS REALLY PROBLEMATIC AND COUNCIL WISELY TURNED THAT DOWN, WHAT ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO NOW, SPRING THAT THAT HAPPENED. SO PLEASE KEEP THAT IN MIND AS I PERSONALLY WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME EXTENSIONS OF A.D.U.s BUT IF WE DON'T DO IT RIGHT, IT WILL GET KILLED LIKE THE LAST ONE DID, AND THAT WAS APPROPRIATE. I WANT YOU TO TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION AND ALSO SEGUE INTO YOUR APPOINTMENTS TO COMMITTEES LATER ON IN THE AGENDA, AND --
00:16:48.259: >> Planning Manager:  30 MORE SECONDS.
00:16:49.761: >> AND THE SINGLE-FAMILY ZONING COMMITTEE. I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL BE PAYING ATTENTION TO THAT. I HOPE THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU KEEP THE PUBLIC WELL AWARE OF AS YOU HAVE DISCUSSIONS WITH THAT, AND ALSO THE COUNCIL OF COMMONS APPOINTMENT, THERE WILL BE A LOT OF PUBLIC EYES ON THAT ONE AS WELL. SO I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING YOUR CHOICE. THANK YOU.
00:17:10.949: >> Chair Mills: THANK YOU. I DON'T SEE ANYONE ELSE ON -- ANY OTHER CALLERS ON THE LINE RIGHT NOW. SO I WILL GO AHEAD AND CLOSE THIS OPPORTUNITY FOR PUBLIC -- FOR -- WHAT DO WE CALL IT NOW? I'M BLANK. PUBLIC COMMENT, AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION. THERE'S ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY AT THE END OF THE MEETING, IN ADDITION TO THE PUBLIC HEARINGS ON THE AGENDA TONIGHT. SO WE MOVE ON TO ITEM 8, WHICH IS THE PUBLIC HEARINGS FOR THE NEXT BUSINESS MEETING.
00:17:43.147: >> Planning Manager:  WE HAVE ONE PUBLIC HEARING ON FEBRUARY 2nd THIS IS 201 SCIO CHURCH ROAD ANNEXATION AND ZONING FOR PUBLIC COUNCIL. ITS TO ANNEX A 1.18-ACRE PARCEL AND ZONE IT A2 ZONING. IT WILL BE COMING WITH A RECOMMENDED WAIVER OF AN AREA PLAN PRIOR TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
00:18:11.109: >> Chair Mills: VERY GOOD. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. WE ARE ON TO OUR UNFINISHED BUSINESS, 9A IS THE LEWIS JEWELERS RETAIL PLAZA SITE PLAN FOR CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL AND SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE. THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE IS FOR PLANNING COMMISSION APPROVAL. AS IS OUR PRACTICE, ON PLANNING COMMISSION, WE'LL GIVE THE PETITIONER UP TO TEN MINUTES TO PRESENT THE PROJECT TO US. THEN WE'LL TURN IT OVER TO MR. KOWALSKI FOR A STAFF REPORT, AND THEN WE'LL OPEN THE PUBLIC HEARING AND AFTER THAT, WE'LL HAVE DISCUSSION AMONG THE PLANNING COMMISSIONERS. SO --
00:18:50.148: >> Planning Manager:  BEFORE WE GET STARTED, OF THE PETITIONERS WOULD SOMEONE LIKE TO SHARE A PRESENTATION?
00:18:57.488: >> YES, I WILL.
00:18:57.989: >> Planning Manager:  OKAY. LET ME MAKE THAT ARRANGEMENT FOR YOU.
00:19:05.363: >> HELLO, EVERYBODY.
00:19:09.534: >> Chair Mills: HI.
00:19:10.868: >> HAPPY THURSDAY.
00:19:11.836: >> Chair Mills: HAPPY THURSDAY! ALL RIGHT.
00:19:13.471: >> ALL RIGHT. LET'S SEE IF WE CAN SHARE THIS. CAN YOU SEE THAT?
00:19:31.456: >> Chair Mills: WE CAN.
00:19:33.558: >> MY NAME IS IT ROB KERR. WE SAW YOU A MONTH AGO, AND WE HAVE DONE SOME UPDATES AND I THINK WE WERE PRETTY EXCITED TO SEE YOU AND MOVE THIS ON TO THE NEXT STAGE. SO AS YOU REMEMBER BEFORE, IT'S 300 SOUTH MAPLE. IT WAS A BUILDING THAT HAS BEEN VACANT FOR QUITE SOMETIME. THAT BUILDING WAS THE CORNER BISTRO. IT'S 1.9 ACRES, C3 ZONING, 9,300 SQUARE FEET WAS THE EXISTING SIZE AND PROPERTY SLOPES FROM WEST TO SOUTHWEST -- OR SOUTHEAST. AND THERE IS A COMMON PARKING AGREEMENT BETWEEN WEST GATE SHOPPING PLAZA AND OUR PROPERTY. ALL RIGHT. THIS IS -- THIS IS OUR PROJECT -- OUR PROPOSED PROJECT ON TOP OF THE BISO AREA, RELATIVE TO THE REST OF THE SHOPPING CENTER, WHICH YOU SAW BEFORE. AND OUR NEW SE PLAN. NOTHING H CHANGED WITH THE BUILDINGS. NOTHING HAS CHANGED OPEN THE NORTH SIDE OF THE PPERTY, AS YOU RECAL WE'RE CREATING A N ACCESS WAYN THE NORTH SIDE. OF THE SHOPPING CENTER.EEST SUE 1 WILL BEEWIS JEWELERS. SUITE TW HAS FOUR TENANTS WCH 'RE WKING ON ROOT N FOR NANTS AND SUITEHREE H TWO TENTS, AND I WILL TAL ABOUT THE CHANGES NOW AT WE CNG ON THE PPEY WAS -- Cir Mil: EXCUSEE, I JUST WAN TO JUMP IN FOR ONE MINUTE. IT SEEMS FROM YOUR -- WHAT YOU WERE SAYING THAT YOU MIGHT THINK WE WERE LOOKING AT A SITE PLAN, BUT THE SLIDES STILL SEEM TO BE ON THE FIRST SLIDE.
00:21:21.566: >> OH,.
00:21:21.933: >> Chair Mills: JUST SO YOU KNOW.
00:21:23.100: >> IT SAYS I'M SHARING THE SCREEN AND I'M ON -- LET ME GO BACK TO THE FIRST ONE. DO YOU SEE THE FIRST ONE?
00:21:31.075: >> Chair Mills: IT HASN'T CHANGED. I ACTUALLY THINK YOU ARE NOT IN, LIKE, PRESENTATION MODE RIGHT NOW. IT'S NOT THE FULL SCREEN. SO MAYBE IT'S SHOWING A DIFFERENT MONITOR. SORRY I DIDN'T SAY THAT EARLIER. IT'S BIG BUT -- AND IT'S NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU GUYS CONTROLLING IT, NOT ME?
00:21:49.060: >> Chair Mills: I DON'T THINK SO. AND IT'S NOT JUST ME BEING -- YOU GUYS ARE ALSO STILL SEEING THE TITLE SLIDE.
00:21:54.799: >> HOW IS THAT? NOW LET'S TRY ONE MORE. IS THAT BETTER?
00:22:00.071: >> Chair Mills: NO, IT DIDN'T CHANGE.
00:22:01.539: >> IT'S FROZEN TO ME. I DON'T SEE HIS MOUSE MOVING.
00:22:07.178: >> OKAY, I WILL STOP SHARING AND TRY IT AGAIN.
00:22:11.983: >> Chair Mills: SOUNDS GOOD.
00:22:18.089: >> OKAY. CAN YOU SEE THAT AGAIN?
00:22:21.826: >> Chair Mills: IT'S LOADING, AT LEAST ACCORDING TO MY SCREEN. I'M NOT SEEING ANYTHING. IT SAYS YOU HAVE STARTED SCREEN SHARING. THIRD TIME IS THE CHARM, THOUGH!
00:22:38.676: >> YES, YES, YES. LET ME HAD -- SORRY ABOUT THIS, GUYS.
00:22:47.518: >> Chair Mills: THIS IS WHY WE DO THE APOLOGY UP FRONT AND WE ARE SO -- YOU KNOW -- NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU USE ZOOM, RIGHT?
00:22:58.396: >> Planning Manager:  MATT, DO YOU HAVE THE PRESENTATION HANDY SO IF IT DOESN'T WORK THERE, WE CAN HAVE MATT ADVANCE IT AND YOU CAN JUST SORT OF GIVE HIM AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION I DON'T E SLEWS -- AUDIO CLUES TO ADVANCE THE SLIDES.
00:23:13.144: >> DO YOU WANT TO --
00:23:15.046: >> SURE. GIVE ME ONE SECOND. I'VE GOT TO SWITCH OVER AND HERE WE GO. WAIT. DID THAT WORK?
00:23:40.037: >> Chair Mills: WE'RE SEEING SLIDE ONE.
00:23:41.772: >> OKAY. LET'S SEE IF I CAN -- NOW IS IT THE NEXT SLIDE?
00:23:49.013: >> Chair Mills: YES!
00:23:50.147: >> OKAY. OKAY. SO I THINK WE KIND OF GOT THROUGH THIS, ROB, AND THEN YOU --
00:23:57.421: >> GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE, PLEASE.
00:23:59.957: >> ALL RIGHT. AND YOU CAN'T -- CAN YOU SEE MY CURSOR OR NOT?
00:24:05.496: >> NO.
00:24:07.698: >> OKAY. SO I WAS ABOUT TO EXPLAIN TO EVERYBODY THAT ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE PROPERTY THERE IS A HANDICAP ACCESSIBLE WALKWAY.
00:24:18.576: >> CAN EVERYBODY SEE MY MOUSE? IT'S IN THIS AREA RIGHT HERE.
00:24:22.113: >> YEAH. AND SO EVERYTHING ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE BUILDING IS THE SAME AS YOU SAW BEFORE. WHEN YOU COME DOWN TO THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE BUILDING, WE TOOK OFF, AND WE TURNED THE TWO TENANTS AND SO THEY ARE FACING WHERE TWO DRIVE THRUS WERE. SO THERE'S MORE OF A CONNECTION WITHIN THE CENTER. THERE'S STILL THE ABILITY TO HAVE GLASS AS YOU WILL SEE IN THE ELEVATIONS ON THE EAST SIDE, BUT ON THE SOUTH SIDE NOW, WE'RE EXPECTING TO HAVE ACCESS. WE HAVE ALSO TALKED ABOUT -- I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN SEE IN THAT FIRST TREE, THAT'S THERE IN THE CORNER, THERE'S A STAIRCASE THAT'S THERE. WE TALKED ABOUT HAVING ACCESSIBILITY FROM THAT CORNER OF THE PROPERTY, UP ON TO THE PROPERTY, AND THE CHANGES THERE ARE SO SIGNIFICANT THAT A RAMP -- WE CHOSE TO DO A STAIR THERE, BUT WE STILL HAVE A HANDRAIL, STEPS, AND THE OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO TRAVERSE THROUGH THE PROPERTY, ALONG A NEW SIDEWALK WHERE IT USED TO BE, BUT WE WERE PROPOSING BEFORE WAS THE DRIVE THRU, AND THEN INTO THE PROPERTY. WE ALSO ADDED, AS YOU WILL SEE, MATT, JUST BELOW THE -- YEAH, THERE. WE ADDED A LOT MORE GREENERY, IF YOU WILL, TO MAKE THAT TRANSITION BETWEEN THE SIDEWALK AND THE -- AND THE ROADWAY. SO GIVE YOU A LITTLE SPACE THERE. SO WE REMOVED THE DRIVEWAY. WE TURNED THE TWO SUITES, OR THE TWO TENANTS ON SUITE THREE. WE ADDED LANDSCAPE ON THE SOUTH SIDE THERE. WE PROVIDED ACCESS ON THE SOUTH, WITH THE HANDRAILS AND A STAIR. AND THE LAST THING WE TALKED ABOUT WHEN WE WERE TOGETHER, WE TALKED ABOUT THE DUMPSTER ENCLOSURE:. WE WENT THROUGH GYRATIONS -- I WISH I COULD SHOW MY PLAN BECAUSE I HAD ONE MORE SLIDE THAT WE CREATED THAT SHOWS ALL THE RESTRICTIONS ON THE SITE. THERE ARE -- THERE'S A 40-FOOT EASEMENT THAT RUNS BASICALLY FROM THE FACE OF SUITE THREE ALL THE WAY DOWN THE PROPERTY LINE. SO BRINGING THE DUMPSTER ON THAT SIDE OF THE STREET IS IMPOSSIBLE. THERE'S ANOTHER ONE ON THE STRIP ON THE WEST SIDE. THERE'S AN EASEMENT THERE. AND THEN MANY -- AND THEN IN THE CENTER AREA, WHERE WE HAVE -- WE HAVE STORM DETENTION AND -- SO WE CAN'T PLANT THAT ON TOP OF IT. ADDITIONALLY, AS I NOTICED IN THE REPORT, THE PLANNING REPORT, IT'S BEEN -- YOU GUYS CHECKED TO SEE IF, YOU KNOW, SOLID WASTE WAS OKAY WITH IT AND, OF COURSE, THEY ARE. AND I WANTED TO ADD TO THAT, IS THAT IT'S 27 FEET TO -- FROM THE CORNER, THE CLOSEST CORNER TO THE PATIO, IT'S 27 FEET. SO IT'S NOT -- IT'S NOT RIGHT UP ON IT. WE WOULD LIKE IT -- WE WOULD HAVE LOVED TO HAVE IT A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY, BUT IT'S STILL 27 FEET AWAY. GO TO THE NEXT -- THAT'S GOTTEN KIND OF MESSED UP. ALL RIGHT.
00:27:37.908: >> YEAH, I'M NOT SURE WHAT'S --
00:27:41.312: >> NEXT ONE. WAIT. THERE WE GO.
00:27:45.015: >> SO THIS ELEVATION DIDN'T CHANGE. JUST GO TO THE NEXT ONE, MATT. AS YOU CAN SEE NOW, JUST IN THIS QUICK RENDERING, WE NOW HAVE MORE SIDEWALK IN FRONT OF SUITE NUMBER THREE, IT'S A TWO-WAY DRIVE WITH PARALLEL PARKING AND WE HAVE MORE GREEN SPACE. SO HAD ONE MORE. YEAH. THAT'S IT. SO WE HOPE THAT YOU LIKE IT AND LIKE IT A LOT, AND WE CAN GET THIS PASSED TODAY, IT WOULD BE A LOT OF FUN. AND WE APPRECIATE EVERYBODY'S HELP AND ATTENTION.
00:28:19.149: >> Chair Mills: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MR. KOWALSKI.
00:28:22.419: >> GOOD EVENING, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU. I DON'T REALLY HAVE A LOT TO ADD IN SUMMARY. AGAIN, MR. KERR KIND OF SUMMED UP THE CHANGES. THOSE WERE THE MAIN ISSUES THAT WE HAD FLAGGED FROM THE LAST PLANNING COMMISSION IN JANUARY. OBVIOUSLY THE DRIVE THRU WAS PROBABLY THE TOP ISSUE, AND THEN ALSO THE SIDEWALK CONNECTIONS AND THEN THE SOLID WASTE ENCLOSURE. WE DID -- IN ADDITION TO THE PETITIONER RUNNING THROUGH NUMEROUS ITERATIONS OF HOW TO FIT THAT ON THE SITE, I MEAN IN MY CONVERSATIONS WITH THE SOLID WASTE COORDINATOR TOO AND LOOKING AT THOSE EASEMENTS, IT TRULY IS THE ONLY PLACE ON THE SITE THAT YOU COULD REALLY PUT THE DUMPSTER. AND IN ADDITION, I HAD REQUESTED THE PETITIONER -- THE PETITIONER REACHED OUT TO WEST GATE BECAUSE I THOUGHT IF THEY WERE -- ONE COMMISSIONER HAD MENTIONED IF THERE WAS A CONCERN THERE, BUT WEST GATE DID ALSO SUBMIT A LETTER SAYING THAT, YEAH, THEY'RE FINE WITH THAT DUMPSTER LOCATION WHERE IT IS. MILLION AND REALLY, AGAIN WITH THAT, SO THERE IS NO -- AND REALLY AGAIN, WITH THAT, THERE'S NO SPECIAL USE EXCEPTION. THAT HAS BEEN WITHDRAWN. THERE'S NO NEED FOR IT. SO AT THIS TIME, IT'S A STANDARD SITE PLAN REVIEW. THE TRANSPORTATION COORDINATOR, AGAIN, WHO HAD CONCERNS OBVIOUSLY WITH THE DRIVE THRU PREVIOUSLY HAS NOW, YOU KNOW, RECOMMENDED HER APPROVAL OF IT, AND WITHOUT THE DRIVE THRU, THAT SHE HAD SAID, I BELIEVE, MY STAFF KNOWS AS WELL, THAT REMOVED THE VAST MAJORITY OF HER CONCERN WITH THE PROJECT. SO, AGAIN, AT THIS TIME, STAFF IS RECOMMENDING APPROVAL, AND I'M AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU.
00:29:54.979: >> Chair Mills: THANK YOU. NOW, I WILL OPEN THE PUBLIC HEARING FOR THIS ITEM. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PERSONS TO SPEAK FOR UP TO THREE MINUTES ABOUT THE PROPOSED LEWIS JEWELERS RETAIL SITE -- RETAIL PLAZA SITE PLAN FOR CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL. NUMPUBLIC COMMENT MAY BE MADE BY CALLING 877-853-5247 AND ENTERING MEETING I.D. 99151611348. CITY STAFF WILL SELECT CALLERS THAT HAVE RAISED THEIR HAND ONE BY ONE, CALLING ON YOU BY THE LAST THREE DIGITS OF YOUR TELEPHONE NUMBER. YOU DIGITALLY RAISE YOUR HAND ON YOUR PHONE BY PRESSING STAR NINE. YOU WILL HEAR AN AUTOMATED ANNOUNCEMENT, ONCE THE HOST IS ALLOWING YOU TO SPEAK, PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU HAVE MUTED ANY BACKGROUND SOUND AND MOVED TO A QUIET AREA AND PLEASE ALSO STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS AT THE BEGINNING OF YOUR COMMENTS. AGAIN, IF YOU ARE ON THE LINE, AND INTERESTED TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING, YOU CAN PRESS STAR NINE TO RAISE YOUR HAND. I KNOW SOMETIMES THERE'S A DELAY, BUT I ALSO DON'T SEE A RUSH.
00:31:15.793: >> Planning Manager:  I DON'T SEE ANY INDICATION.
00:31:17.828: >> Chair Mills: ALL RIGHT. WE WILL CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING AND I WILL READ THE MOTION. BECAUSE THE -- A SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE HAS BEEN WITHDRAWN, WE ONLY HAVE ONE MOTION BEFORE US AND THAT IS THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION HEREBY RECOMMENDS THAT THE MAYOR AND THE CITY COUNCIL APPROVE THE LEWIS JEWELERS RETAIL PLAZA SITE PLAN, SUBJECT TO OBTAINING THE REQUIRED OFF-STREET PRIVATE STORM SEWER EASEMENT, AND THE OFF-SITE -- OR SORRY, THE OFF-SITE PRIVATE STORM SEWER EASEMENT AND THE OFF-SITE PUBLIC WATER MAIN EASEMENT PRIOR TO THE ISSUANCE OF ANY BUILDING PERMIT. MOVED BY COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN, SECONDED BY COMMI COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT. WE ARE IN DISCUSSION. COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL?
00:32:03.273: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: FIRST OF ALL, THANK YOU, DESIGN TEAM, AND THE OWNER FOR MAKING ALL THE CHANGES THAT YOU DID, FOR LISTENING TO US, AND TO BEING SO RESPONSIVE TO THEM. IT'S ALWAYS REALLY NICE TO SEE THAT. YOU HAVE DONE THAT IN A REALLY THOROUGH WAY. I PERSONALLY REALLY APPRECIATE THAT. I ONLY HAD TWO SMALL THINGS. ONE WAS THAT IF WE COULD PULL UP THE SITE PLAN, ONE OF THE BIKE RAMPS ISAY FUNNY AREA, WHERE THERE WERE STAIRS. SO DOWN IN E LOWER RIGHT CORNER -- I'M NOT SE WHO IS NTROLLING THIS. SO IT'S ON --
00:32:47.151: >> TT WOULD BEE.
00:32:48.152: >> Commissioner GibRandall: YEAH,ATT SO IT'S ON THE FRONT DE OF THE BLDING. OKAY, AND YOU SEE THE LITTLE SET OF STAIRSOING UP, U TTHE LEFT IS A BE HP AND THIS ARE'S J STAIRS GETTING TO IT? AN I'M JUSONDERINGIND NOT LOO FORT THERE, IF IERED A BIKER. AND SO I'M JT WONDENG IF THAT'S SOMHING TT COULD BE POTENTIALL-- OR FIRSTF ALL, DON'T KW; A NUMR T, IFT IT'S KIND OF LIKE,ELL, IT'S JUST TUCKED IN THERE AND IF THERE IS SOME FLEXIBILITY, MAYBE THAT'S SOMETHING THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE SHIFTED BETWEEN NOW AND CITY COU COUNCIL. SO THAT'S ONE QUESTION. AND THE OTHER QUESTION WAS ABOUT TREES. WHY DON'T YOU ANSWER THE BIKE HOOP QUESTION FIRST.
00:33:38.769: >> I WILL ANSWER FOR THAT. WE LOCATED IT THERE BECAUSE WE EXPECTED SOMEONE FROM PROBABLY THE LEWIS JEWELERS WOULD RIDE THEIR BIKE TO THE FACILITY, BUT IT CAN BE PLACED, YOU KNOW, WITH THE OTHERS IF THAT'S PREFERRED.
00:33:55.485: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: I WOULD BE BIKING ALONG STADIUM AND I WOULD COME IN AND SO SOMETHING THAT FEELS VISIBILITY FROM WHERE YOU ARE TURNING IN FROM THE ROAD.
00:34:06.863: >> MM-HMM.
00:34:07.164: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: SO IF THERE'S SPACE SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WALK IF THERE'S HAVE SPACE SOMEWHERE THAT YOU CAN EYEBALL IT WHEN YOU ARE BIKING IN. BECAUSE I THINK GIVEN THAT THAT OTHER AREA IS ELEVATED AND HAS STAIRS, IT'S NOT VERY INTUITIVE THAT YOU WOULD LOOK FOR A BIKE LOOP THERE. AGAIN, THAT'S THE LAST THING I WANT TO HOLD THIS PROJECT UP OVER, BUT IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT COULD BE EASILY ACCOMMODATED, AND KIND OF THINKING THROUGH ANOTHER PLACE THAT MAKES SENSE AND THAT IS -- IS, YOU KNOW, NOT A BIG DEAL FOR YOU ALL TO MOVE AROUND, I THINK THAT COULD BE AN IMPROVEMENT FOR THE DESIGN IN TERMS OF THOSE OF US WHO BIKE IN AROUND TOWN.
00:34:47.871: >> HOW ABOUT WE WORK WITH MATT ON THAT?
00:34:50.941: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: THAT'S GREAT. I'M SURE YOU WILL ALL COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT'S LOGICAL.
00:34:55.646: >> THANK YOU.
00:34:56.013: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: AND THEN THE OTHER PIECE IS THAT IN WHY YOU ARE RENDERING. EYE TOTALLY GET THE DUMPSTER THING AND THERE'S ALL THE TURNING RADIUS AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING THAT YOU HAVE TO WORK AROUND. IN THE SITE PLAN, I NOTICED THAT THERE WERE A COUPLE OF EVERGREEN TREES THAT WERE BLOCKING THE VIEW FROM THE BACK PATIO, WHICH IS GR GREAT. BUT IN THE RENDERING, I SAW SOMETHING ELSE. I ASSUME THE BLACK AND WHITE PLANS ARE THE ONES I SHOULD BE LOOKING AT AS KIND OF MAIN THING AND THAT IT WAS PROBABLY JUST LIKE, WHERE YOU ARE PLOPPING DOWN THE TREES WITH THE RENDERING SOFTWARE AND GO WITH WHATEVER WAS ON THE ACTUAL LANDSCAPE PLAN? INTO YES, THE LANDSCAPE PLAN RULES.
00:35:46.263: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: OKAY. THEN THAT'S FINE. I WANTED TO CONFIRM THAT BECAUSE I SAW IT WAS INCONSISTENT BETWEEN THE TWO AND I THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO HAVE EVERGREENS THERE. THANK YOU. FOR ALL OF YOUR CHANGES HERE.
00:36:03.013: >> THANKS FOR YOUR HELP.
00:36:04.314: >> Chair Mills: ANY OTHER PLANNING COMMISSIONERS HAVE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS?
00:36:14.191: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT.
00:36:17.594: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: ON THAT SAME POINT. I THINK I WAS THE ONE THAT KEPT BRINGING UP THE DUMPSTER. I APPRECIATE YOU EXPLORING IT. I THINK IT WAS THE RENDERING, THE 3D RENDERING THAT SHOWED THE EVERGREENS AND THE PLAN -- I WAS TRYING TINTRYING TO PULL IT UP. WHICH TREES ARE GOING IN. I WAS THINKING SOMETHING TO MITIGATE IT WOULD BE EVERGREENS AND WHEN YOU BROUGHT UP THAT RENDERING I WAS LIKE, OH, THAT LOOKS GREAT. AND ONE OF THE FIRST SLIDES, I THINK SHOWED FOUR TREES PLACED ON THAT LAWN. YEAH. SO THE RENDERING THAT WE SAW, YOU LIKED THE EVERGREEN PLACEMENT BETTER?
00:37:09.479: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: WELL, THERE WERE TWO RENDERINGS. THERE WAS A 3D THING, AND THAT HAD EVERGREENS ON IT AND THEN ONE WAS THE TOP DOWN VIEW AND THAT HAD THIS ON IT. I DON'T KNOW, LIKE --
00:37:24.728: >> IN THE POINT IS TO HAVE THE EVEREVERGREENS BUFFER THE VIEW. THIS CAN BE MOVED DOWN TO THE DUMPSTER ITSELF AND MAKE IT MORE OF A BLOCKING TREE IF THAT WOULD MAKE EVERYBODY FEEL BETTER BECAUSE THE RENDERING DOES DO THAT. IT SORT OF BLOCKS IT.
00:37:51.121: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: I THOUGHT THE RENDERING WAS NICE AND IT LEFT THE OPEN SPACE AS LAWN THAT PEOPLE COULD USE WHILE SORT OF BLOCKING THE VIEW. IF THAT'S SOMETHING YOU COULD LOOK AT DOING AND HAVE IT MATCH THE RENDERING A LITTLE BIT MORE, I THINK IT WOULD BE A LITTLE BETTER, OTHERWISE, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALL OF THE WORK ON THIS. I'M EXCITED TO THIS PROJECT.
00:38:11.107: >> CAN WE ALSO WORK WITH MATT ON THAT?
00:38:13.143: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: OH, YEAH.
00:38:18.181: >> Chair Mills: ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM PLANNING COMMISSIONERS? COMMISSIONER LEE.
00:38:26.156: >> Commissioner Lee: JUST A FAIRLY QUICK QUESTION FOR PETITIONER. YOU SAID THERE WAS PARALLEL PARKING. IS THAT TOWARDS THE BUILDING ARE IS THAT -- OH, THAT'S ON THE SOUTH SIDE. ACTUALLY THAT CLEARED IT UP PERFECTLY. THANK YOU. IT'S JUST OPEN SOUTH SIDE. PERFECT. THANK YOU.
00:38:43.273: >> Chair Mills: ANYTHING ELSE? ALL RIGHT. I THINK MR. LENART, WE ARE READY FOR A ROLL CALL VOTE THEN.
00:38:59.322: >> Commissioner Milshteyn: YES.
00:38:59.990: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: YES.
00:39:04.194: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: YES. HAD.
00:39:12.235: >> Councilmember Disch: YES.
00:39:14.204: >> Commissioner Lee: YES.
00:39:14.771: >> Commissioner Clarke: YES.
00:39:15.372: >> Counc
00:39:24.915: >> Chair Mills: YES.
00:39:25.382: >> WOW! THANK YOU.
00:39:27.083: >> Chair Mills: GOOD LUCK AT CITY COUNCIL.
00:39:28.852: >> MATT, THANK YOU FOR ALL OF YOUR HELP. YOU FREED ME.
00:39:32.689: >> NO PROBLEM. THAT'S WHAT I'M HERE FOR. YOU'RE WELCOME.
00:39:37.727: >> SEE YOU GUYS.
00:39:39.229: >> Chair Mills: ALL RIGHT. THE NEXT ITEM FOR BUSINESS IS 9B, THIS IS THE PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO CHAPTER 55 UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE SECTION 5.30.1, THE PLANNED PROJECT SITE PLAN MODIFICATIONS FOR CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL. STAFF IS BRINGING THIS TO US. SO THERE'S NO PETITIONER PRESENTATION. MS. DEDID  DILEO IS HERE TO PRED THEN WE'LL OPEN UP THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
00:40:13.697: >> DOING A MICROPHONE CHECK.
00:40:15.999: >> Chair Mills: YOU'RE GOOD.
00:40:16.633: >> I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER MY LAST MEETING. THANK YOU, PLANNING COMMISSION. I WILL BE PRESENTING TO YOU FOR APPROVAL SOME AMENDMENTS TO THE U.D.C. REGARDING PLANNED PROJECT MODIFICATIONS. I KNOW THAT WE HAVE SOME NEW MEMBERS. SO I WILL DO -- I WILL SPEND A MOMENT WITH A LITTLE BUILT OF BACKGROUND. PLANNED PROJECTS ARE IN THE U.D.C. IN SECTION 5.30.1. AND WE TOOK UP THIS PROJECT SOME TIME AGO THINKING HOW CAN WE EVOLVE THEM? HOW CAN WE MAKE THEM BETTER, MORE USABLE AND HOW CAN WE GET MORE OF WHAT WE -- OF WHAT THE CITY DESIRES. THE CURRENT PLANNED PROJECT SECTION IS VERY OPEN ENDED. IT HAS NO LIMITATIONS ON HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY CAN BE ACHIEVED. AND IT HAS NO MINIMUMS OR THRESHOLDS OF HOW MUCH BENEFIT. THROUGH THE WORK PLANNING COMMISSION DID AFFIRM THAT HAVING A TOOL SUCH AS THIS IS VALUABLE AND IT SHOULD BE KEPT IN SOME FORM IN THE U.D.C., BUT AS IT CURRENTLY SITS, IT WAS A LITTLE TOO NEBULOUS. A LITTLE TOO MUSHY. SO WE PUT FORTH A COUPLE OF DRAFTS. WE TOOK A CIU CIRCUITOUS ROUTE O GET HERE. OCTOBER 6th OF 2020, STAFF PUT FORTH SOME AMENDMENTS. WE ASKED THE PLANNING COMMISSION TO DISCUSS THEM AND VALIDATE THEM, BUT THE ATTACHED DOCUMENT WAS NOT FULLY COMPLETED. IT DID NOT HAVE ALL THE NECESSARY ADDITIONS AND DELETIONS, THE CONCEPTS WERE THERE. PLANNING COMMISSION DID THAT, DISCUSSED, VALIDATED. SO STAFF PREPARED A COMPLETE ORDINANCE TO AMEND. WE MADE SOME MINOR -- I SHOULDN'T SAY AMENDMENTS. WE MADE SOME MINOR REVISIONS AND I WILL PRESENT THOSE TONIGHT. SO IN SUMMARY, THE NEW PARAGRAPHS THAT WE ARE OFFERING OFFER THE FLEXIBILITY AND THE SETBACKS IN MULTIFAMILY RESIDENTIAL, MIXED USE AND NONRESIDENTIAL SPECIAL PURPOSE DISTRICTS. THEY OFFER EXCEPTIONS TO HEIGHT LIMITS FOR SUSTAINABILITY AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS AND PARKING WAIVERS OR -- FOR ALSO SUSTAINABLE AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS. THE AMENDMENTS ARE INTENDED TO REPLICATE THE MAJORITY OF THE BENEFITS THAT ARE OFFERED AND REALIZED BY THE CURRENT PLAN PROJECT MODIFICATION SECTION, BUT LESS COMPLICATED, MORE STRAIGHTFORWARD, MORE PREDICTABILITY, MORE INTUITIVE. THEY ARE NOT EXACT SOP COPY, BUT THEY ARE INTENDED TO KEEP THE BEST OF WHAT WE HAVE MOVING FORWARD. I WILL SCREEN SHARE FOR THE BENEFIT OF FOLKS -- SORRY. I'M TRYING TO OPEN TWO WINDOWS AT ONCE. I WILL SCREEN SHARE FOR THE BENEFIT OF THOSE WATCHING WHO MAY NOT HAVE THE POCKET IN FRONT FRONT -- THE PACKET IN FRONT OF THEM. ALL RIGHT. HAS THIS LOADED ON THE SCREEN? GREAT. OKAY. SO THE -- AN ADDITION IS PROPOSED TO SECOND 5.18.3 FOR ADDING AIL SECTION ENTITLED SETBACK LINE, AND YARD ALTERNATIVES. ONE, FOR MULTIPLE FAMILY RESIDENTIAL ZONING DISTRICTS. THIS IS PULLING FROM THE EXISTING DIMENSIONAL TABLE AND OFFERING THE EXACT -- AND JUST REPEATING WHAT IS CURRENTLY OFFERED. I HAVE REWORDE IT FOR CLARITY, BUT WHAT IT SAYS IS THE NORMAL SIDE -- REQUIRED SETBACK PROVIDED IN THE TABLE MAY BE USED FOR BUILDINGS OVER 50 FEET IN LENGTH OR WIDTH OR OVER 35 FEET IN HEIGHT, AS LONG AS THE TOTAL INCREASE SETBACK REQUIRED BY THE FOOTNOTE IS PROVIDED AND SHOWN ON THE PLAN. AND THE FOOTNOTE REQUIRES A FEW INCHES OF ADDITIONAL SETBACK FOR EVERY FEET -- OR FOOT OF BUILDING LENGTHR WIDTH OVER 50 AND/OR RIGHT OVER 35. AND SO YOU HAV GOT AN ADDITIONAL AREA THAT -- TT IS REQUIRED ANDOW YOU CAN DO THAT TERNATIVELYOULD BE WITH A BUILDING OF VARD DESIG A C-SHAPED BILLING AN L-SHAPE WHERE THE LEGS OF BUIING, MIGHT MEET THE NORMAL SETBACK BUT A CUTBACK H BEEN PROVID TO MEET THEOTAL ARE I HAVE - WE HAVE NOWHIS DFT CLUDES ANLTERNATIVE. THE PNNING COMMIION MAY NORTH, YOUSKED STA TD NEAR ANYZE WHEERT WOU --HE YOU TIME WARPED AND I FIVE YEARS' TIME THESE WERE APPROVED NEAR NORTH WAS PROVIDED. WE FOUND THAT NEAR NORTH MET THIS SIDE SETBACK REQUIREMENT, BUT IT ALSO WAS USING PLANNED PROJECT MODIFICATIONS FOR ITS REAR SETBACK. AND WE AREN'T OFFERING THEM. SO I HAVE A SUBSTITUTE PARAGRAPH FOR THE PLANNING COMMISSION'S CONSIDERATION, THAT SIMPLY TAKES THAT BUT ADDS ON THE REAR. SO THE SUBSTITUTE LANGUAGE WOULD BE THE NORMAL SIDE AND REAR REQUIRED SETBACK PROVIDED IN THE TABLE, MAYBE USED FOR THOSE BIG BUILDINGS AS LONG AS THE INCREASED SIDE AND REAR SETBACK REQUIRED IS PROVIDED. EXAMPLES, AGAIN, C, L, T AND U-SHAPED BUILDINGS. WE HAVE ADDED THIS CONCEPT FOR MIXED USE NONRESIDENTIAL AND SPECIAL ZONING DISTRICTS AS WELL. WE COULD NOT JUST TAKE THAT SAME LANGUAGE AND COPY IT OR ADD THESE DISTRICTS TO THE MULTIFAMILY BECAUSE THEY HAVE GOTTEN DIFFERENT THINGS GOING ON. THERE IS NO ADDITIONAL SETBACK REQUIRED FOR THESE DISTRICTS. SO THERE'S NOTHING NO FLEX THERE. SO WE SAID HERE, WE ARE NOW NEWLY OFFERING TO THEM THE MINIMUM SETBACKS, FRONT, SIDE, OR REAR, MAYBE DECREASED BY 50% WHEN ANOTHER SETBACK IS INCREASED BY THE SAME AMOUNT. SO THIS IS ALLOWING THE FOOTPRINT AND THE BUILDING ENVELOPE TO SHIFT. IT BULGES OUT ON ONE SIDE BUT IT WOULD HAVE TO PINCH IN ON ANOTHER SIDE TO BALANCE. THE ORIGINAL DRAFT IN OCTOBER DID NOT -- I'M SORRY, DID OFFER INCREASED FLEXIBILITY AS WELL. THAT'S BEEN PULLED OUT. IT IS HARD -- WHEN YOU INCREASE A SETBACK, IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE THEN TO BULGE IT IN A DIFFERENT WAY. ALSO, NOT SURE IF WE WANT TO OFFER THAT FLEXIBILITY TO INCREASE A SETBACK. WE WANT BUILDINGS TO BE CLOSER TO THE STREET. AND IF THERE IS A HARDSHIP THAT IT CAN'T BE CLOSE, THAT MAYBE IS PROBABLY THE MOST APPROPRIATE PROCESS IS A VARIANCE. AND THEN MOVING ON TO THE NEXT SECTION THIS IS AS PROPOSED IN OCTOBER. WE ARE OFFERING AN EXCEPTION TO THE HEIGHT LIMIT. WHEN YOU HAVE A SUSTAINABLE OR AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT, AND THESE TERMS ARE DEFINED. THEY ARE NOT IN THIS SECTION HERE, BECAUSE THEY WILL BE ACEDDEAADDED -- BE ADDED TO THE DEFINITIONS. YOU CAN INCREASE THE HEIGHT LIMIT BY UP TO 30% WHEN YOU ARE MEETING CERTAIN CONDITIONS. ONE THE CONDITIONS IS WHEN YOU ARE WITHIN 300 FEET OF A RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT, YOU HAVE TO STEP BACK YOUR BUILDING OR SET THE WHOLE THING BACK A LITTLE BIT FARTHER. AND THERE IS A SIMILAR CONCEPT IS PROPOSED FOR PARKING. NO OFF-STREET VEHICLE PARKING WILL BE REQUIRED AGAIN FOR SUSTAINABLE OR AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS. THOSE ARE DEFINED. AGAIN, CERTAIN CONDITIONS. THE SITE PLAN PROJECT, WHATEVER AMENITIES YOU ARE PROVIDING TO OBTAIN THIS NO-PARKING WAIVER ARE NOT THE EXACT SAME ONES THAT ARE BEING COUNTED TOWARDS PREMIUMS IF YOU ARE USING PREMIUMS. YOU WOULD HAVE TO DOUBLE UP OR -- OR PUT THEM ON TOP OF EACH OTHER. MUST PROVIDE ANY OTHER REQUIREMENT OF THIS SECTION -- OF THE TABLE, MEANING THAT BICYCLE PARKING IS REQUIRED AND IF ANY PARKING IS PROVIDED, STILL THE E.V. SPACES ARE SATISFIED. AND THEN FINALLY, THE DOCUMENT HAS BEEN FLESHED OUT WITH ALL THE REQUIRED COMPONENTS. YOU CAN SEE WE HAVE A SECTION THAT ADDS THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING COMPONENT DEFINITION TO THE -- TO THE ORDINANCE IN THE TABLE. WE WILL BE DELETING THE FOOTNOTE AND MOVING IT TO THE ALTERNATIVE SETBACK SECTION. AND WE ARE DELETING THE ENTIRE PLANNED PROJECT MODIFICATION SECTION. I WILL GO A LITTLE FASTER DOWN HERE. WE ARE ALSO ADDING A SECTION FOR NON-CONFORMING PLAN PROJECTS. WE ARE ACTUALLY NOT GIVING THEM ANY ADDITIONAL RIGHTS, BUT WE ARE REITERATING WHAT THE RIGHTS THEY ALREADY HAVE. WE WILL BE CREATING SOME NON-CONFORMING BUILDINGS BY REMOVING THE PLANNED PROJECT SECTION. SO WE JUST WANTED TO BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO THOSE. THEY CAN BE MAINTAINED AS THEY ARE. ANY ADDITIONS TO THEM OR MODIFICATIONS WOULD GO THROUGH THE EXISTING PROCESS FOR ALTERATION OF A NON-CONFORMING STRUCTURE AND IF THEY ARE REDEVELOPED, THEY NEED TO BE REDEVELOPED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CURRENT CODE PROVISIONS. WE ARE NOT ADDING ANYTHING TO THEM, BUT WE ARE CLARIFYING FOR USER-FRIENDLINESS EXACTLY WHAT WOULD HAPPEN. I WILL STOP THE SHARE. STAFF IS RECOMMENDING APPROVAL OF THESE AMENDMENTS. WE -- AGAIN, WE THINK THAT IT IS STILL PROVIDING THAT TOOL FOR FLEXIBILITY. WE HAVE HAD SOME STAFF DISCUSSIONS ABOUT WHETHER SOME OF THESE THINGS ARE PREMIUMS THAT WE'RE OFFERING, AND WE DON'T THINK THAT THEY ARE PREMIUMS. WE -- WE ARE NOT NECESSARILY ENCOURAGING  SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OR AFFORDABLE DEVELOPMENT. WE ARE NOT OFFERING REALLY CARROTS. WHAT WE ARE DOING IS SAYING IF YOU ARE DOING ONE OF THOSE PROJECTS, WE RECOGNIZE IT'S HARD, AND WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE IT A MINUTE AMOUNT EASIER FOR YOU TO REALIZE THE DEVELOPMENTS THAT YOU ALREADY WANTED, THAT THE PREMIUM SECTION IS THE SECTION TO REALLY OFFER THOSE INCENTIVES AND OFFER MORE THAN WHAT YOU COULD HAVE HAD OTHERWISE. BUT HERE, WE ARE JUST TRYING TO KEEP THE BENEFITS OF PLANNED PROJECT, WHICH OFFERED THAT FLEXIBILITY AND DESIGN, BUT MAKE IT MORE NARROWED, MORE FOCUSED, MORE SPECIFIC AND JUST MAKING IT A LITTLE EASIER, RECOGNIZING THAT IT CAN BE HARD NO PULL OFF THOSE PROJECTS. I'M HERE FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR FOLLOW-UP AND WELCOME TO LISTEN TO YOUR DISCUSSION, PARTICULARLY ABOUT WHICH SUBSTITUTE YOU WOULD LIKE FOR THE SETBACK ALLOWANCE. BRETT?
00:51:56.365: >> Chair Mills: MR. LENART?
00:51:56.966: >> Planning Manager:  I WANT TO PIGGYBACK ON THAT LAST SECTION THAT CITY PLANNER DILEO REFERENCED. WE DID DISCUSS THIS, AND WE DISCUSSED IT IN A COUPLE OF CONTEXT. THE EXERCISE THAT WAS USED WITH THREE NORTH, FOR EXAMPLE, ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THAT -- NEAR NORTH, FOR EXAMPLE, ABOUT WHETHER WHETHER OR NOT THAT WAS A BEN BENEFIT AND WE PROVIDE THT FLEXIBILITY CURRENTLY ON SIDES NOT ON REARS. AND THEN, THE FINAL ASPECT OF THAT, I WOULD JUST -- THIS IS NOT A SURVEY OF LAND USE ACROSS THE CITY, BUT I THINK THAT -- I THINK THAT IT'S REASONABLE TO THINK ABOUT SIDE YARDS PERHAPS BEING MORE LIKELY TO SHARE ZONING CATEGORIES AND USES MORE FREQUENTLY THAN PERHAPS REAR PROPERTY LINES, PARTICULARLY ALONG CORRIDORS. AND SO WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THAT FLEXIBILITY, FOR EXAMPLE, BEING ADDED TO A PROPERTY ALONG WASHTENAW, WHERE SIDE-TO-SIDE, IT MIGHT BE IF NOT THE EXACT SAME ZONE, IT MAY BE SHIFTING FROM A COMMERCIAL TO A DIFFERENT TYPE OF COMMERCIAL ZONING, THAT MIGHT BE DISTINCT FROM A SPECIAL PROPERTY THAT IS ABUTTING RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY TO THE REAR OF IT. AGAIN, THAT'S A GENERALIZATION, BUT THOSE -- I JUST WANTED TO ADD THAT. THAT WAS A CONSIDERATION THAT WE HAD, AND AS WE'RE PRESENTING IT, IT DOES NOT INCLUDE THE ADDITION OF THAT REAR YARD, BUT SINCE THAT WAS SUCH A TOPIC, I APPRECIATE THAT -- THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS DISCUSSED AND WE WANTED TO PROVIDE THAT LANGUAGE AS AN ALTERNATIVE. I JUST WANTED TO FRAME IT A LITTLE BIT FURTHER LIKE THAT.
00:53:40.603: >> Chair Mills: THANK YOU. BEFORE WE OPEN THIS UP, COMMISSIONER CLARKE, YOU HAD YOUR HAND UP EARLIER. I SAW YOU -- I WANTED TO MAKE SURE IF THERE'S AP AN OUTSTANDIG QUESTION BEFORE WE MOVE ON. I WAS REALLY HAVING A HARD TIME HEARING ALEXIS. I WASN'T SURE IF ANYBODY ELSE WAS HAVING THE ISSUE OR NOT.
00:54:01.624: >> Chair Mills: IT WAS OKAY FOR ME.
00:54:04.126: >> Councilmember Disch: I TURNED UP THE VOLUME.
00:54:11.467: >> Chair Mills: SO YOU MAY HAVE TO TURN UP THE VOLUMEA. LEXIS.
00:54:14.503: >> Planning Manager:  IT'S WEIRD, BECAUSE SHE'S ALWAYS YELLING AT ME.
00:54:18.974: >> WELL, I'M HOARSE.
00:54:22.611: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: CTN TURNED UP. YOU MAY NEED TO ADJUST YOUR MICROPHONE SETTINGS IN ZOOM.
00:54:32.555: >> Chair Mills: GREAT. IN NON-DIGITAL SPACE, PEOPLE WOULD, LIKE, DO MORE HAND SIGNALS OR -- SO FEEL FREE TO DO THAT IN THIS SPACE. I APPRECIATE YOU RAISING YOUR HAND AND SINCE YOU PUT -- I WAS GETTING READY TO CALL ON YOU WHILE MS. DILEO WAS TALKING. I WAS LIKE, OH, MUST HAVE SOLVED ITSELF. SORRY. INCORRECT ASSUMPTION. OKAY.
00:54:54.109: >> COMMISSIONER CLARKE, ANY PARTICULAR QUESTION, PLEASE GO AHEAD.
00:55:02.551: >> Commissioner Clarke: IT WAS JUST THAT. OKAY.
00:55:07.223: >> IT WILL COME UP.
00:55:09.391: >> Chair Mills: I'M SURE THERE WILL BE LOTS OF DISCUSSION ON EACH OF THE ELEMENTS OF THIS. FIRST WE WILL HAVE THE PUBLIC HEARING. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PERSONS TO SPEAK UP TO THREE MINUTES ABOUT THE PROPOSED UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE, PLANNED PROJECT MODIFICATION ORDINANCE AMENDMENTS. PUBLIC COMMENT CAN BE MADE BY CALLING 877-853-5247, AND THEN ENTERING MEETING I. I.D.99151611348. CITY STAFF WILL SELECT CALLERS THAT HAVE RAISED THEIR HAND BY CALLING ON YOU BY THE LAST THREE DIGITS OF YOUR TELEPHONE NUMBER. YOU DIGITALLY RAISE YOUR HAND BY PRESSING STAR NINE. AFTER HEARING THE AUTO MATED MESSAGE THAT YOU -- THAT THE HOST IS ALLOWING TO YOU SPEAK, PLEASE MAKE SURE TO MOVE TO A QUIET AREA AND MUTE ANY BACKGROUND SOUNDS SO WE CAN HEAR YOU. PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS AT THE BEGINNING OF YOUR COMMENTS. SO FOR ANY CALLERS ON THE LINE, WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING, PLEASE PRESS STAR NINE TO RAISE YOUR HAND. IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THE PUBLIC HEARING ABOUT THE PLANNED PROJECT SITE PLAN MODIFICATIONS, PLEASE PRESS STAR NINE. BASED ON THE COMMENT EAR LITTLER, I KIND OF THI THE CACALLER OPEN THE LINE WANTED TO TALK ABOUT THIS. SPEATO THIS ITEM, CAN YOUO HAND AND LET US KNOW?E YOUR GREAT. [ DOG BARKING ] AND THERE'S MR. LENART'S DOG.
00:57:27.963: >> Planning Manager:  SORRY.
00:57:29.598: >> I DIDN'T REALLY INTEND TO SPEAK ON THIS, BUT YOU ARE BEGGING ME. SO I THINK THIS IS REALLY GREAT.
00:57:37.272: >> Chair Mills: I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER CALLERS ON LINE. THE ANN ARBOR PLANNING COMMISSION HEREBY RECOMMENDS THAT THE MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL APPROVE THE JANUARY 15, 2021 DRAFTED AMENDMENTS TO CHAPTER 55 UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE TO DELETE SECTION 5.30.1, AND AMEND SECTIONS 5.17 AND 5.18 RELATED TO PLANNED PROJECT SITE PLAN MODIFICATIONS. ADDITIONAL AREA, HEIGHT AND PLACEMENT STANDARDS, EXCEPTIONS TO HEIGHT, AND PARKING STANDARDS. MOVED BY COMMISSIONER DISCH, SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS? ON THE PROPOSAL? COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL AND THEN COMMISSIONER DISCH?
00:58:23.686: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: I KNOW I'M A VISUAL PERSON, BUT THE WHOLE THING WITH THE DIFFERENT SHAPED BUILDINGS, I REALLY COULD HAVE USED SOME SORT OF GRAPHIC TO EXPLAIN WHAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THERE.
00:58:36.765: >> OKAY.
00:58:37.032: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: SO I THINK THIS WOULD MAKE IT JUST MUCH MORE CLEARER FOR PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. SO I WOULD -- I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT IN THERE. AND THEN THE OTHER THING THAT I JUST WANT TO REALLY BE CLEAR ABOUT IS IF YOU ARE DOING AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING THING OR A SUSTAINABLE HOUSING PROJECT, AND YOU ARE NOT A PLANNED PROJECT, DOES THAT -- YOU DON'T NEED TO HAVE PARKING THERE FOLLOW YOU ALL THE WAY THROUGH, DEPENDING ON WHEREVER YOU ARE? OR IS IT ONLY FOR A PLANNED PROJECT THAT THAT HAPPENS?
00:59:11.533: >> WELL, THERE WILL BE NO MORE PLANNED PROJECT.
00:59:14.870: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: OH, I GET IT. I SEE WHAT YOU ARE SAYING. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH RIGHT.
00:59:18.974: >> SO IF YOU MEET OUR DEFINITION OF AFFORDABLE DEVELOPMENT --
00:59:24.146: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: RIGHT.
00:59:24.980: >> OR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT, THEN THERE'S NO OFF-STREET PARKING REQUIRED. SO YOU CAN STILL PROVIDE SOME. BUT YOUR REQUIREMENT WOULD BE ZERO. AND IT WOULD FOLLOW FOR AS LONG AS THE -- THE SITE PLAN REMAINS THE -- THE DEVELOPMENT REMAINS PER PLAN.
00:59:49.705: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: AND WITH SOME, I HAVE NOT LOOKED AT YOUR DEFINITION OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT, BUT QUITE A FEW OF THE METRICS OUT THERE WITH THE MORE RECENT VERSIONS OF LEED AND THE LIVING BUILDING CHALLENGE, YOU DON'T HAVE TO GET CERTIFIED UNTIL YOU PROVE THAT YOU YOU ARE PULLING T OFF.
01:00:08.190: >> OUR DEFINITION IS WHEN YOU HAVE A SOLAR SEL COLLECTOR SURF, NOW THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH OTHER TERMS THAT WE USE, BUT IF YOU HAVE SOLAR PANELS. IF YOU HAVE SOLAR COLLECTOR SURFACE COVERS 60% OF THE BUILDING'S FOOTPRINT AREA AND YOU HAVE ELECTRICAL PANELS THAT HAVE CAPACITY TO SOLELY POWER THE SITE WITH ELECTRICITY, INCLUDING ANY CONDUIT OR NECESSARY INFRASTRUCTURE FOR FUTURE CONVERSIONS IF COMPLETE ELECTROIFICATION IS NOT ACHIEVABLE AT THE TIME OF INITIAL CONSTRUCTION.
01:00:38.487: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: OKAY.
01:00:41.423: >> SO WE ARE QUITE SPECIFIC. THERE ARE A LOT OF WAYS THAT YOU CAN GO ABOUT BEING SUSTAINABLE.
01:00:47.529: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: OKAY.
01:00:48.497: >> OUR CRITERIA FOR BOTH THE HEIGHT WAIVER AND THE PARKING WAIVER IS SOLAR PANELS ON 60% OF THE ROOF AND ELECTRIFICATION.
01:01:01.376: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: OKAY. THAT MAKES SENSE. IF, I KNOW SOME DEVELOPMENTS HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET AWAY WITH NOT HAVING A GAS-POWERED GENERATOR. AND WOULD IT MAKE IT -- IF THEY WERE DOING EVERYTHING ELSE AND HAD THE 60% AND LIKE BASICALLY HAD ELECTRIFICATION GOING ON IN TERMS OF THEIR CAPACITY AND EVERYTHING, AND THEY HAD A GAS LINE FOR A GENERATOR THERE AS WELL, DO THEY STILL QUALIFY?
01:01:31.707: >> I WOULD OPEN IT UP FOR DISCUSSION ON HOW IT SHOULD BE INTERPRETED IN THAT CASE.
01:01:37.913: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: I THINK WE'RE GOING TO RUN INTO THAT, BECAUSE YOU WOULD NEED TO HAVE SO MUCH SOLAR CAPACITY THAT YOU COULD BASICALLY POWER YOUR WHOLE THING PLUS WHATEVER. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? SO YOU WOULD BE OFF GRID ESSENTIALLY IN SOME WAYS. SO THAT'S JUST A WRINKLE IN THERE, THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO THINK ABOUT. AND -- AND I DON'T KNOW IF IT MEANS JUST KIND OF PUTTING SOME SORT OF EXCEPTION IN THERE AROUND THAT, BUT I KNOW THAT THAT'S A COMMON ISSUE THAT IS, LIKE, THEY WANT TO DO IT ALL ELECTRIC, BUT THEY NEED THE BACKUP GENERATOR THING TOO, AND IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK. THEY HAVE TO RUN A GAS LINE FOR THAT.
01:02:14.149: >> YEAH. I THINK THAT THE WAY IT'S WRITTEN, ACTUALLY, GAS GENERATOR WOULD STILL LEAVE THEM ELIGIBLE.
01:02:22.291: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: OKAY.
01:02:23.959: >> IT DOESN'T SAY THERE SHALL BE NO NATURAL GAS TO THE SITE, NO LEED. WHAT IT SAYS IS ELECTRICAL PANELS HAVE THE CAPACITY TO SOLELY POWER THE SITE BY ELECTRICITY. SO --
01:02:36.672: >> Plannin
01:02:38.640: >> Planning Manager:  YES. --
01:02:39.841: >> YOUR PRIMARY ENERGY SOURCE AND NOT YOUR BACKUP. AND ALSO --
01:02:43.011: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: OKAY.
01:02:44.112: >> Planning Manager:  BUT I THINK AS IT'S WRITTEN, TO BE CLEAR, IT DOESN'T REQUIRE ALL ELECTRIFICATION.
01:02:50.919: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: YES, THAT'S WHAT I WAS WONDERING. PLAN>> Planning Manager:  IT'S FUTURE-PROOFING THE BUILDING FOR THAT POSSIBILITY.
01:03:02.864: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: OH, OKAY. I GUESS JUST FOLLOWING PRETTY TYPICAL BUILDING CODE, YOU WILL HAVE TO HAVE WINDOWS AND INSULATE, AND GOES WITH SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? BUT YOU ARE REALLY JUST GETTING AT THE SOLAR PANELS AND THE ELECTRIFICATION IS THE PRIMARY THINGS THAT YOU ARE GOING FOR AND LEAVING ALL THE OTHER COMPLICATED STUFF ASIDE?
01:03:26.421: >> YEAH.
01:03:26.855: >> Planning Manager:  WE COULD --
01:03:28.423: >> BECAUSE THIS IS ZONING AND NOT A BUILDING CODE.
01:03:30.659: >> Planning Manager:  YES, AND IDEALLY MEASURABLE AT THE TIME OF OCCUPANCY.
01:03:35.397: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: RIGHT.
01:03:36.231: >> Planning Manager:  AND YOU TALK ABOUT THE VERTIFICATION PROGRAM -- CERTIFICATION PROGRAMS THAT REQUIRE A LONGER LIFE SPAN. THAT'S CHALLENGING FOR US TO EVALUATE AND CERTIFY AT THE TIME.
01:03:46.475: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: RIGHT. AND DID YOU ALL RUN THIS BY THE SUSTAINABILITY OFFICE IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU WERE THINKING WITH THIS?
01:03:52.914: >> YES, I DID. I SPOKE TO THEM. AND SPECIFICALLY I TALKED ABOUT THE PERCENTAGE. AND I BELIEVE OUR FIRST WAS 30%. ANYSELF AND -- MYSELF AND THE SUSTAINABILITY OFFICE SETTLED ON 60%. THEY WERE HOPING FOR 100%. I FELT WE COULD MAYBE -- DEPENDING ON TECHNOLOGY IMPROVEMENTS, DEPENDING OPEN HOW MUCH THIS PROVISION IS USED, I FELT WE COULD GO UP, BUT I THOUGHT THAT 100% WAS A LITTLE BIT TOO AMBITIOUS GIVEN THE REALITIES OF CONSTRUCTION. I DID NOT THINK THAT MOST DEVELOPERS WOULD BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY COVER 100% OF THE ROOF SURFACE. FOR ALL TYPES OF BUILDINGS, WE HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS COULD BE PITCHED ROOFS, FLAT ROOFS AND IT COULD BE ON RESIDENTIAL, IT COULD BE ON COMMERCIAL, INDUSTRIAL AND I DID WORK WITH THEM ON A -- ON ATTAINABLE STANDARD.
01:04:57.879: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: OKAY. AND THEN I KNOW OFTEN TIMES TO BE ABLE TO PULL THIS OFF TO TRY TO BECOME, YOU KNOW, EVEN CLOSE IN TO NET ZERO, YOU PRETTY MUCH HAVE TO COMBINE IT WITH SOME SORT OF ALTERNATIVE HEAT SOURCE IDEA TOO, YOU KNOW? HEAT PUMP SYSTEM OR SOME SORT OF GEOTHERMAL SOMETHING. SO ARE WE JUST KIND OF SAYING THAT'S NOT PART OF IT? YOU ARE JUST 60% OF THE ROOF AND HAVING THE CAPACITY TO DO ELECTRIFICATION? COMMISSIONER MILLS, YOU MAY HAVE OPINIONS ABOUT THIS. YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT THIS THAN I DO. BUT ALL THE BUILDINGS I HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH IN TERMS OF MY OWN PRACTICE, THAT'S ALWAYS A PART OF IT IS FIGURING OUT THAT WHOLE PART OF THE EQUATION IN TERMS OF ENERGY SAVINGS. SO THAT MAY PUT TOO MANY WRINKLES IN THIS, BUT I WANT TO PUT IT OUT THERE, IN TERMS OF, YOU KNOW, GETTING -- HAVING -- IF YOU ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE TO REQUIRE -- IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THE PARKING, YOU KNOW, THEN, YOU KNOW, THAT'S -- THAT'S -- SHOULD WE MAKE THE SETTING A SLIGHTLY HIGHER BAR WITH THAT? I'M PUTTING IT OUT THERE TO THE GROUP. THAT'S IT FOR NOW.
01:06:13.555: >> Chair Mills: THANK YOU. I HAVE A BUNCH OF QUESTIONS TOO. SO I WROTE THAT DOWN WHEN I COME BACK. COMMISSIONER DISCH, IF YOU WANT TO GO.
01:06:20.428: >> Councilmember Disch: I JUST HAVE ONE QUICK QUESTION, BECAUSE I LEARN MORE FROM WHAT YOU ALL SAY -- OR NO, ACTUALLY, IT'S NOT A QUESTION. I WANTED TO SAY THAT I THOUGHT THAT THE ALTERNATIVE THAT ALLOWED FOR THE REAR SETBACK MADE SENSE TO ME, BECAUSE IT'S NOT AS IF THEY GET IT AUTOMATICALLY, AND SO PLANNING STAFF AND PLANNING COMMISSION WOULD EVAL WET WHETHER THE REAR SETBACK -- WHETHER YOU COULD REDUCE THE REQUIRED REAR SETBACK AND WHETHER THAT WOULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY INTERFERING FOR AN ADJACENT DIFFERENT, YOU KNOW, ZONE. SO THAT -- AND PARTICULARLY BECAUSE WE -- BECAUSE THE NORTH MAIN PROJECT WOULDN'T HAVE QUALIFIED WITHOUT THAT PROVISION, I THINK WE WANT THAT KIND OF FLEXIBILITY. SO I FEEL LIKE THAT'S OKAY AND I'M GLAD YOU EXPLAINED WHY YOU HAD INITIALLY EXCLUDED IT, BUT I THINK THAT PEOPLE CAN USE THEIR BEST JUDGMENT AS THE SITE PROPOSALS COME UP. SO THAT'S ALL I WANTED TO SAY.
01:07:28.697: >> I WOULD MAKE SURE THAT IT'S CLEAR, THIS WOULDN'T BE A DISCRETIONARY ITEM. WE ARE JUST OFFERING THIS FLEXIBILITY FOR ALL PROJECTS. IT DOES HAVE SOME NATURAL LIMITATIONS. WE ARE NOT OFFERING ANY FLEXIBILITY FOR THE NORMAL SETBACK AREA. IF THE REAR SETBACK OR THE SIDE -- IF THE REAR SETBACK IS 30 FEET, IT'S 30 FEET. AND IF YOU WANTED TO FLEX THAT OR ENCROACH INTO THAT, WE ARE NO LONGER OFFERING ANY TOOL FOR THAT. WHAT WE ARE DOING IS FOR THE LARGER BUILDINGS, WHERE WE HAVE AN ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENT FOR ADDITIONAL SETBACK, WE'RE SAYING YOU CAN FLEX THAT ADDITIONAL COMPONENT BUT WE ARE SAYING THAT IT'S JUST THERE. THERE'S NO SPECIFIC APPROVAL FOR IT. THERE'S NO -- IT IS NOT A A DICTIONARY. WE ARE OFFERING THAT FLEXIBILITY, BUT THE TRADEOFF IS WE ARE NO LONGER OFFERING ANY FLEXIBILITY FOR THE NORMAL SIDE AREA. WE ARE ONLY OFFERING FLEXIBILITY TO EVERYONE WITHOUT FURTHER APPROVALS FOR THE ADDITION. SO WE ARE STILL OFFERING A FLEXIBILITY TOOL. IT IS NOT AS POWERFUL AS PLANNED PROJECTS, BUT IT IS NOW -- BUT IT IS EASIER TO USE. THERE'S NO DISCRETIONARY ELEMEN
01:08:59.621: >> Councilmember Dis: OKAY. SO NOW I WILL NEED TO HR OTHER PEOPLE WEIGH IN ON THAT, BAUSE THAT MAKES ME A LITTLE BIT MORE THE BI BUILDINGS THAT WOU BEY ANNOYING.
01:09:12.133: >> THIS I WHAT MR. LART WAS SAYING THAT IT'NHERENT, RIGHT NOW, THAYOU CAN FLEX THAT ADDIONAL AREA ONHE SIDE, AND HE W SAYING,OU KNOW, MOS OFTEN YOU HAVE REDEIAL ZONING AACT TO THE RIDENTI ZONG,IK FOR LIKEROBABLY THECALE OF BUILDINGS WILL B SIMILAR. BUT THE SCALE IS MORE OFTEN DISSIMILAR FROM REAR-TO-REAR, BECAUSE OUR BOUNDARIES, OUR ZONING DISTRICT BOUNDARIES TYPICALLY GO THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF A BLOCK, BUT IF THEY WERE TO SPLIT A BLOCK, THEY WILL SPLIT IT LENGTH-WISE AND NOT MODIFICATMIDBLOCK.WE THOUGHT, NP THE SETBACKS JUST AS THEY ARE WITH ADDITIONAL SETBACK FOR BIG BUILDINGS. JUST TO SMA SHORTEN UP THE LONG AND WE WERE AT FIRST COMFORTABLE WITH THAT, BUT UPON ANALYSIS APPLYING THAT TO REAL PROJECTS THERE CAN BE A CASE WHERE -- WHERE THE REAR SETBACK, THE ADDITION MIGHT NOT WORK.
01:10:24.706: >> Councilmember Disch: AND SO -- AND I THINK THERE'S JUST ONE OTHER THING THAT I DIDN'T FULLY COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND, BECAUSE I WASN'T HERE FOR THE BEGINNING OF ALL OF THIS DISCUSSION. SO THE ADVANTAGE OF WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IS PRECISELY THIS IS NOT DISCRETIONARY. THIS IS NOW IN THE ZONING CODE, BECAUSE EVERYTHING, OF COURSE, I HAVE SEEN US DO HAS BEEN DISCRETIONARY.
01:10:45.493: >> YEAH.
01:10:45.760: >> Councilmember Disch: OKAY. SO I LEARNED SOMETHING AND NOW THAT'S DONE. I HAVE TO LEARN SOMETHING ELSE.
01:10:49.764: >> YES. AND FOR YOU AND COMMISSIONER CLARKE AND COMMISSIONER LEE, THE PLANNED PROJECT WAS -- IT HAS ITS PROS AND CONS, AND IT'S NOT NECESSARILY GOOD OR BAD, BUT WHAT IT DOES, IT OFFERS UNLIMITED FLEXIBILITY. IF YOU WERE TO READ IT WORD FOR WORD, IT SAYS THAT YOU CAN FLEX THE AREA, HEIGHT AND PLACEMENT STANDARDS. IT OFFERS NO LIMITATIONS ON IT. BUT IT -- AND IT ALSO SAYS IN EXCHANGE, IF YOUR PROJECT ACHIEVES THESE AMENITIES, AND ONE OF THEM WAS INCREASED -- FOR EXAMPLE, INCREASED OPEN SPACE. THERE'S NO MINIMUM THRESHOLD. SO WE HAVEN'T REALLY HAD A PROJECT BUT READING IT BLACK AND WHITE, SOMEONE COULD ASK FOR 50E 1% OF OPEN SPACE. AND THAT IS WHAT WE WANTED -- AND IT WOULD MEET THE STANDARDS. SO WE WANTED TO BE MORE CLEAR FOR ALL PARTIES, CLEAR FOR THE APPROVING BODIES ABOUT WHAT IS AN ACCEPTABLE FLEXIBILITY, AND WHAT IS ACCEPTABLE AMENITIES AND WE BOILED IT DOWN TO SETBACKS AND HEIGHT AND PARKING WERE THE MOST DESIRABLE FLEXIBILITIES TO OFFER, AND WE -- AND IT BOILED DOWN TO AS WELL SAYING THAT WE CAN -- FOR RESIDENTIAL PROJECTS, YOU CAN WORK WITH THAT ADDITIONAL SETBACK AREA. FOR NONRESIDENTIAL PROJECTS, YOU CAN WORK WITH THE SETBACKS BUT ONLY HALF OF THEM, 50%. FOR HEIGHT, WE SAID, YOU CAN WORK WITH THE HEIGHT, BUT ONLY 30% OF THE HEIGHT LIMIT. AND WHAT WE WILL ACCEPT IN EXCHANGE, YOU MUST BE EITHER AFFORDABLE OR SUSTAINABLE. SO WE PICKED OUR TWO PRIORITY AMENITIES, AND OUR THREE PRIORITY FLEXIBLE STANDARDS. AND WE REMOVED ALL DISCRETIONARY ELEMENTS. SO YOU MEET IT OR YOU DON'T AND THAT WAS ALSO THE THEORY BEHIND IF YOU REMOVE THIS GIANT TOOL, WE WILL MAKE IT EASIER TO USE THE NEW TOOLS BUT THEY ARE JUST -- THEY ARE NOT AS POWERFUL.
01:13:11.272: >> Chair Mills: AND, AGAIN, THE KIND OF RELIEF VALVE IS WE STILL HAVE PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS, P.U.D.s.
01:13:18.479: >> THERE'S STILL VARIANCE, PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS, OR RETHINK YOUR PROJECT.
01:13:26.487: >> Chair Mills: RIGHT. OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS? COMMISSIONER LEE.
01:13:34.996: >> Commissioner Lee: I WILL ECHO COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL'S COMMENT THAT A VISUAL WOULD HELP TO DELIVER CLARITY. I'M TRYING TO FIGURE THIS OUT, A SKETCHUP, THE MINIMUM SIDE PLUS SIDE A AND B AND GOING THROUGH THIS, AND MAKE SURE I CLEARLY UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE VOTING ON. I'M ON BOARD WITH DEFINING AFFORDABILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY. I ACTUALLY REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR REASONABLE STANDARD OF 60%. YOU CAN'T NECESSARILY COVER 100%. WE CAN CERTAINLY TRY, BUT THAT'S GOING TO BE TOUGH. AND THEN OBVIOUSLY AFFORDABILITY. WITH THOSE TWO PRIORITIES SET AND I'M JUST BASICALLY REITERATING TO MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND. WHAT WE ARE SAYING IS RIGHT NOW WE ARE BOWLING AND THE ENTIRE LANE IS MASSIVE. WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO IS HERE IS THE ACTUAL LANE AND WE ARE TRYING TO NARROW THAT, AND IF YOU WANT TO GO THE UNLIMITED ROUTE, GO THE P.U.D. ROUTE. IF YOU WANT TO -- FOR THE PLANNED PROJECT SIDE OF THINGS, LET ME AT LEAST HELP DEFINE THAT THE AREAS IN WHICH WE CAN GIVE ON IS MINIMUM SIDE, MINIMUM REAR SETBACKS AND THAT'S REALLY THE EXTENT IN WHICH WE WILL WORK. AND BASICALLY, LET'S SAY, R3, MINIMUM SIZE IS THAT BUT THE AREA OF PLUS A AND B CAN BE FLEXED. IS THAT AN ACCURATE REPRESENTATION? YES. I THINK SO.
01:15:00.782: >> Commissioner Lee: OKAY. YEAH, JUST ECHOING AGAIN, COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL'S COMMENT, VISUALS, I THINK WOULD HELP, ESPECIALLY PEOPLE EVEN DIGGING IN. SO MAYBE WHAT WE DO IS JUST ADD IN -- JUST EVEN LIKE LITTLE PICTURES.
01:15:15.963: >> YEAH, YEAH. I UNDERSTAND. I WILL TRY TO GET THEM IN -- I WILL GET THEM IN FOR COUNCIL.
01:15:23.071: >> Commissioner Lee: OKAY. GREAT. THAT WAS THE COMMENTS I HAD. JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE I KNEW WHAT WE WERE ACTUALLY VOTING ON. SO I KNOW WE ARE NEW TO THIS.
01:15:35.550: >> Chair Mills: I HAVE A CLARIFICATION AND A LIST. SO MAYBE IT WILL SPUR OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. JUST BE CLEAR ON THE FIRST ITEM, RIGHT, THIS IS THE SETBACK LINE WHAT IS CURRENTLY IN OUR CODE, ALLOWS FOR IN FLEXIBILITY FOR FOR SIMULTANEOUSY FAMILY RESIDENTIAL ON -- MULTI FAMILY RESIDENTIALS, TRUE? SIDE TRUE.
01:16:02.343: >> Chair Mills: AND DOES THE C, L, T, AND U-SHAPED, THAT WAS YOU SAYING WHERE IT COULD POSSIBLY BE DONE.
01:16:10.752: >> YES.
01:16:11.152: >> Chair Mills: THIS IS WHERE SKETCHING OUT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE. AND TO BE CLEAR, THAT PART, THE FLEXIBILITY, WHERE YOU ARE MOVING WITHIN THE FOOTPRINT, EFFECTIVELY, YOU ARE TRANSLATING THE BUILDING, NOW ONLY SIDE TOSIDE OR POTENTIALLY IF -- OR POTENTIALLY IN THE MIXED USE RESIDENTIAL, COULD YOU GO CLOSER TO THE STREET, RIGHT?
01:16:34.609: >> YEAH.
01:16:35.309: >> Chair Mills: THOSE DO NOT REQUIRE AFFORDABILITY OR SUSTAINABILITY COMPONENTS? CORRECT.
01:16:41.516: >> Chair Mills: THIS IS WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT FOR A WHILE, AGAIN FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS FOR, YOU KNOW, MONTHS. THOSE ARE THINGS THAT PEOPLE WANT TO SHIFT IT TO SAVE TREES OR FOR ANOTHER REASON, AND SO AS LONG AS THEY ARE STILL PROVIDING THE SAME AMOUNT OF OPEN SPACE AND LANDSCAPING, YOU CAN'T REDUCE YOUR LANDSCAPING REQUIREMENTS BY DOING, THIS RIGHT? LIKE --
01:17:03.704: >> YES, THIS IS ONLY FOR SETBACKS. EVERY OTHER DEVELOPMENT STANDARD APPLIED.
01:17:12.013: >> Chair Mills: AND IF YOU NEED A CONFLICTING LAND USE BUFFER, YOU HAVE TO STILL PROVIDE IT IF IT'S REQUIRED IN YOUR SIDE YARD, TRUE?
01:17:22.957: >> TRUE.
01:17:23.224: >> Chair Mills: SO THAT'S ONE CLASS OF THINGS. I APPRECIATE YOU PROVIDING THE ALTERNATE LANGUAGE, BUT I PERSONALLY AGREE THAT WE SHOULD NOT INCLUDE THE REAR PART IN IT BECAUSE THERE'S NO DISCRETION IN IT. I THINK SIMPLIFYING THINGS AND HAVING STAFF JUST BE ABLE TO SAY YOU MEET THIS YOU CAN DO THIS. ITS NOT LIKE, OH, WHAT WILL PLANNING COMMISSION SAY ABOUT THIS, I THINK THAT'S A GOOD MOVE.
01:17:51.152: >> OKAY.
01:17:51.419: >> Chair Mills: I THINK FOR THE TIME BEING, NOT ALLOWING THAT DISCRETION IN THE REAR YARD AND IF STAFF BRINGS -- LIKE, IF IT'S -- IF THERE ARE PROJECTS WHERE THIS COMES UP, LETTING US KNOW, THIS IS A LIVING DOCUMENT. THE ZONING ORDINANCE IS LIVING. I THINK THAT'S A MOVE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.
01:18:16.010: >> THAT'S WHAT I HAVE ON THAT. THE HEIGHT AND THE PARKING, THAT'S WHERE YOU NEED TO HAVE AFFORDABILITY, 15% AFFORDABILITY OR THE SUSTAINABILITY COMPONENTS.
01:18:27.054: >> YES.
01:18:27.321: >> Chair Mills: MY FIRST QUESTION IS, I KNOW FOR THE PARKING WHAT YOU ARE COUNTING TOWARDS EITHER AFFORDABILITY OR SUSTAINABILITY CANNOT COUNT TO YOUR PREMIUMS. BUT CAN IT GET YOU BOTH ADDITIONAL HEIGHT AND NO PARKING?
01:18:46.874: >> LET ME READ. YES.
01:18:54.415: >> Chair Mills: GOOD. I THINK THAT'S APPROPRIATE. BECAUSE, AGAIN, WE ARE NOT GIVING IT AWAY. THIS IS NOT IN EXCHANGE FOR ADDITIONAL F.A.R., THIS IS SAYING, YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT THAT IS APPROPRIATE. I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT. AGAIN, THERE'S ALSO A LIMIT TO HOW MUCH ADDITIONAL HEIGHT THERE COULD BE, AND IN MANY WAYS, LIKE NOT REQUIRING THE PARKING CONTRIBUTES TO THOSE GOALS. WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT WHETHER AFFORDABLE UNITS MEET ALL OF THE PARKING THAT OUR MULTIPLIER REQUIRES, PARTICULARLY AS MANY OF THE AFFORDABLE UNITS THAT WE ARE SEEING -- I MEAN, SOMETIMES WE SEE LARGER UNITS BUT SOMETIMES WE SEE ONE BEDROOM UNITS AND WE REQUIRE ONE AND A HALF SPACES PER UNIT.
01:19:33.087: >> RIGHT.
01:19:33.387: >> Chair Mills: AND THEN ON THE OTHER SIDE, SUSTAINABILITY. HOPEFULLY THE PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN BUYING INTO A BUILDING OR RENTING FROM A BUILDING THAT HAS SUSTAINABILITY FEATURES ARE ALSO NOT IN A PERSONAL VEHICLE ALL THE TIME. AND NOT PARKING SO THAT SAME LEVEL. SO I THINK IT'S -- I THINK THERE'S A REASONABLE CONNECTION THERE. SO I'M COOL WITH THAT. I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT TO EVERYBODY ELSE. IF ANYBODY HAS AN ISSUE WITH THAT, LIKE, THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU SHOULD -- WE DID -- THAT'S BEEN PART OF OUR DISCUSSION ABOUT, LIKE, SHOULD THESE THINGS DOUBLE COUNT AND WHERE STAFF LANDED WAS THEY SHOULD FOR WITHIN THESE TWO ELEMENTS AND I'M OKAY WITH THAT, BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE IF ANYBODY ELSE ISN'T THAT THEY GET IT OFF THEIR CHEST NOW. THE OTHER THING I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT I'M READING THIS RIGHT, BUT ALSO FOR THOSE WHO WERE NOT INVOLVED IN THIS CONVERSATION, THE SOLAR COLLECTOR AREA. TO BE CLEAR, IT'S THE BUILDING FOOTPRINT, NOT THE ROOF AA. SO WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO PUT THOSE SOLAR PANELS ON YOUR ROOF.
01:20:44.291: >> YES.
01:20:44.992: >> Chair Mills: YOU COULD DO SOLAR CARPORTS AND HAVE A PITCHED ROOF AND DO SOLAR CARPORTS AND THAT'S OKAY. I WANTED TO LET EVERYBODY ELSE KNOW SO, AGAIN, THERE COULD BE OPPORTUNITIES TO GO HIGHER IN THE FUTURE. RIGHT NOW, I THINK 60% IS HUTCH MORE THAN WHAT -- IS MUCH MORE THAN WHAT WE ARE SEEING. IT'S DEFINITELY A STEP 123489 IN THERIGHT DIRECTION, BUT ALSOS DOESN' MN THAT WE WOULD NEVER HAVE PITCHED ROOFS INHE CITY ANY MORE. YO KNOW? FACINGF THAT RF IS NORTH THAT'SHE RIGHT READI O
01:21:29.603: >> CORRE.REC THATAS DE FOR THAT FLEXIBILITY SAY YOU WANT A ROOF TOP DECK. I DON'T KNOW.
01:21:40.748: >> Chair Mills: COMMISSIONER SAUVE IS NOT HERE, AND I THINK SHE BROUGHT THAT UP. I THINK SHE SHOULD GET A PAT ON THE BACK BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT WAS SAVVY. THE FINAL ONE THAT COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL ASKED ME ABOUT. THIS DOES NOT REQUIRE ELECTRIFICATION, AND, IN FACT, PEOPLE COULD STILL PUT IN A GAS STOVE. IT'S NOT JUST SAYING THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO THAT WHAT IS CONSIDERED KIND -- MANY PEOPLE CONSIDER THE HARD PART, RIGHT WHICH IS THE SPACE HEATING. ITS NOT JUST THAT PART THAT COULD STAY GAS FOR THE TIME BEING. IT'S THAT AS LONG AS YOU HAVE A BIG ENOUGH, YOU KNOW, ELECTRICAL PANEL, YOU COULD STILL PUT IN A GAS STOVE A GAS WATER HEATER. THIS IS ONE WHERE I -- YOU KNOW, A COUPLE OF THE MEETINGS AGO, I SAID WE GOT TO GET INFORMATION ON, LIKE WHAT ARE THE COST TRADEOFFS AND I DON'T HONESTLY, QUITE FRANKLY -- I HAVE MOVED IN THAT DIRECTION BUT I HAVEN'T PUSHED AS FAR ON THAT AS I COULD. SO I DON'T KNOW -- REALLY TORN ABOUT THIS. ON THE ONE HAND, THERE'S CERTAINLY COST SAVINGS IN THEM NOT -- IN THEM BEING ENABLED TO NOT HAVE TO BUILD PARKING. WE KNOW THAT SOME DEVELOPERS DON'T WANT TO BUILD THE PARKING AND WE -- THAT WE REQUIRE IT ADDS COSTS FOR THEM. FOR THOSE THAT ARE IN THAT BOAT, THIS IS SAVING THEM MONEY. EVEN IF SOME OF THOSE SPACE HEATING SYSTEMS, ELECTRIFIED SPACE HEATING SYSTEMS ARE MORE EXPENSIVE AND WHAT WE HEARD IS THAT NOT ALWAYS UP FRONT, OVER THE OPERATIONS THEY MAY BE, BUT UP FRONT THEY MAY NOT BE MORE EXPENSIVE. EVEN SO, MAYBE THERE IS A SAVINGS THERE. I WOULD SAY AT THIS TIME, I DON'T WANT TO STAND IN THE WAY. I THINK THESE THINGS ARE GOOD. LIKE, I THINK THAT THE SOLAR PANELS ALONE, THE 60% AREA OF SOLAR, IN MY MIND IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.
01:23:46.640: >> OKAY.
01:23:46.974: >> Chair Mills: AGAIN, THE BENEFITS THAT WE ARE OFFERING ARE AS COMMISSIONER LEE RIGHTLY PUT, LIKE MUCH NARROWERED, MORE NARROW LANE. WE HIGHLIGHTED ELECTRIFICATION AND THIS IS ALSO ONE BECAUSE ZONING IS A LITTLING DOCUMENT I HOPE THAT -- A LIVING DOCUMENT, I HOPE THAT AS WE GET MORE INFORMATION, IT'S EASIER TO CHANGE. IT'S JUST STRIKE THAT PART AND WE CAN COME BACK TO THAT BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT WE ARE THAT I PERSONALLY AM IN A PLACE TO SAY, LIKE, YEAH, WE SHOULD JUST REQUIRE ALL ELECTRIFICATION RIGHT NOW. AND SO RATHER THAN HAVE THIS WAIT FOR THAT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, I WOULD HAVE IT MOVE FORWARD WITH WHERE IT IS, IT MAY NOT BE AS SUSTAINABLE AS I LIKE IT. I DON'T THINK THAT IT WILL MEAN THAT NO ONE WILL TAKE US UP ON THIS.
01:24:37.258: >> YEAH.
01:24:37.524: >> Chair Mills: IN THAT MAKES SENSE. THAT HAS WHERE I FALL ON IT. THAT'S WHAT WAS ON MY LIST. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT SPURRED ANY -- YES, MR. LENART?
01:24:51.905: >> Planning Manager:  I'M TRYING TO -- I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON THE QUESTION ABOUT HEAT PUMPS AND HEATING MECHANISMS. I KNOW THAT QUESTION CAME UP. I'M TRYING TO FIND THE BEST WAY TO PRESENT SOME INFORMATION TO THE COMMISSION ON THAT. SO HOPEFULLY THAT WILL BE PART OF OUR EDUCATION SOMETIME HERE, BUT I WOULD ALSO JUST ASK YOU TO THINK ABOUT THAT IN THAT SAME CONTEXT, THAT AS WE GET MORE SPECIFIC INTO BUILDING SYSTEMS, WE ARE LOCKING THAT BUILDING IN AS PART OF THAT APPROVAL. SO IF WE SPECIFY A CERTAIN KIND OF HEAT, A HEAT PUMP AND THAT'S CONDITIONED UPON THE APPROVAL, AND IN THE FUTURE IF THEY WANT TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT, THEY CAN'T. SO THAT'S -- YOU KNOW, THIS IS ABSOLUTELY THE STUDENTS WHERE WE WANT TO  -- OPPORTUNITIES WHERE WE WANT TO LOOK AT SUSTAINABILITY, BUT I WANT TO BE MINDFUL THAT WE ARE NOT CREATING A LONG-TERM HARM. THAT'S WHY PARTICULARLY WHATEVER WE ARE DOING, IF WE CAN DO IT -- MEASURE IT AT A SNAPSHOT IN TIME, THAT'S PARTICULARLY BENEFICIAL, I THINK FROM A LAND USE PERSPECTIVE. AGAIN, IT'S NOT TO SAY WE CAN'T EXPLORE THOSE THINGS AND I'M -- LIKE I SAID, I'M WORKING TO TRY TO BRING SOME MORE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THAT, BUT I WOULD ASK YOU TO BE MINDFUL OF THAT SO THAT WE ARE NOT DELVING INTO THE FLEXIBILITY. BUILDING. WE WANT FLEXIBILITY LONG TERM.
01:26:22.062: >> Chair Mills: I APPRECIATE THAT. MY UNDERSTANDING IS SOME OF THE TECHNOLOGIES IS THAT THEY APPLY TO DIFFERENT TYPES OF BUILDINGS, WHICH MEANS THAT IT'S MORE COST CONSIDERATIONS NOW ARE DIFFERENT IN DIFFERENT TYPES OF SITUATIONS. IT MAY MEAN LIKE IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS IN ATTACHED STRUCTURES AND NOT THERE -- I DON'T KNOW. LIKE, FOR DETACHED STRUCTURES AND THAT WAS THE POINT OF THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE TECHNOLOGY, BUT POINT WELL TAKEN. I WOULD SAY FOR THE RECORD, LIKE, SYSTEMS THAT ARE BUILT ON NATURAL GAS ARE NOT LONG FOR THIS WORLD. WE ARE QUICKLY MOVING AWAY FROM IT, AND ALL AT ALTERNATIVES ARE GETTING CHEAPER. AND SO, YOU KNOW, TO FUTUREPROOF OURSELVES, LIKE, IT'S THE WISE INVESTMENT IF YOU ARE GOING TO OWN THAT PLACE FOR A WHILE TO THINK ABOUT DOING -- EVEN IF IT'S NOT THE EXACT SAME TECHNOLOGY, SOMETHING THAT IS ON THE ELECTRICITY SYSTEM, WHICH CAN BE EASILY DECARBONIZED. MORE EASILY DECARBONIZED THAN NATURAL GAS, WHICH IS A FOSSIL FUEL IS BETTER. SO IT'S MORE FUTUREPROOF. COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN.
01:27:38.172: >> Commissioner Milshteyn: SO I'M SUPPORTIVE OF THESE CHANGES. I KNOW WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THEM FOR A WHILE. ALEXIS, THANK YOU FOR ALL OF YOUR WORK ON THIS. I'M REALLY SUPPORTIVE. MR. LENART, I WOULD LOVE -- LOVE, LOVE, LOVE TO GET EDUCATION ON HEAT PUMPS, ELECTRIFICATION, FROM SOMEBODY WHO KNOWS IT BETTER THAN GOOGLE. EVERY -- I SEEM TO DO A LOT OF RESEARCH AND IT'S REALLY CONFLICTING AND I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S THE NATURAL GAS LOBBY -- IT SEEMS REALLY CONFLICTING AND I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO LEARN FROM SOMEBODY WHO GETS IT AND CAN EDUCATE US. OVER THE LAST -- PROBABLY SAY THE LAST TWO YEARS, WE HAVE BEEN GETTING A LOT MORE TECHNICAL IN THIS, AND IT'S A BIG PART OF A2ZERO AND I FEEL LIKE I'M NOT EDUCATED ENOUGH TO DO A GOOD REVIEW OF THESE PROJECTS THAT ARE, YOU KNOW, 100% ELECTRICITY. SO I WOULD LOVE THAT IDEA, HOWEVER YOU CAN GET US THAT EDUCATION WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED.
01:28:47.841: >> SO IF NOT GOOGLE, WIKIPEDIA, YEAH?
01:28:52.813: >> Chair Mills: THE BOTTOM LINE IS WHAT ELECTRICITY PRICE AND GAS PRICE ARE THEY COMPARING TO EACH OTHER. THAT'S AMONG THE REASONS WHY THERE'S CONFLICTING INFORMATION. SO SORRY. SARAH'S TWO CENTS WHICH IS MAYBE NOT THAT MUCH BETTER THAN GOOGLE OR WIKIPEDIA. COMMISSIONER DISCH.
01:29:12.900: >> Councilmember Disch: I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR A TINY BIT MORE DELIBERATION ON THIS ISSUE OF AS LONG AS 9 BU THE BUILDING IS ELC CAPABLE, WE ARE OKAY WITH THE DEVELOPER OR THE HOMEOWNER, DEPENDING ON WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT INSTALLING ALL GAS APPLIANCES. AND I JUST -- I'M COMING IN LATE TO THIS CONVERSATION. SO I DO NOT WANT TO THROW UPPED ROO BLOCKS. I WANT TO HEAR -- UP ROADBLOCKS. I WANT TO HEAR -- I UNDERSTAND WHY IT'S GREAT TO HAVE IT ELECTRIC CAPABLE. I GET THAT, BUT APPLIANCES HAVE A LIFE SPAN, YOU KNOW. SOME OF THEM 20 YEARS. YOU KNOW, THE BEST OF THEM. YOU KNOW, WE ARE TALKING 2030 ABOUT OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT AND IT'S 2020 RIGHT NOW, AND THESE PROJECTS ARE GOING TO BE ACTUALLY BUILT FIVE YEARS FROM NOW, WHICH MEANS THAT, YOU KNOW, 2025 PLUS 10 TO 20 YEARS WE HAVE GAS APPLIANCES IN THESE BUILDINGS, UNLESS WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE SO ENVIRONMENTALLY MINDED THAT THEY WILL THROW OUT AN APPLIANCE THAT'S EXPENSIVE AND HAS A LOT OF LIFE IN IT AND REPLACE IT WITH ELECTRIC. SO JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE.
01:30:42.589: >> Chair Mills: COMMISSIONER LEE.
01:30:43.757: >> Commissioner Lee: I SUPPOSE THIS IS MORE OF A SEMANTIC INTERPRETATION. WHEN YOU READ THIS LANGUAGE, THE SUSTAINABILITY COMPONENT, I'M ON PAGE 4, IT SAYS THAT THE SOLAR COLLECTOR SURFACE, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, AND INCLUDING ANY CONDUITS AND NECESSARY INFRASTRUCTURE FUTURE CONVERSIONS IF COMPLETE ELECTRIFICATION IS NOT ACHIEVABLE AT THE TIME OF THE INITIAL CONSTRUCTION. SO IT'S THAT KIND OF LIKE QUALIFICATION THAT GIVES ME PAUSE. I MEAN, COMMISSIONER DISCH, I TOTALLY HEAR YOU. OH, YEAH, PUT ALL THE INFRASTRUCTURE, BUT I WILL GO OIL AND GAS. I THINK IT TELLS YOU IF IT IS POSSIBLE TO GO ELECTRIFICATION, YOU SHOULD DO IT TO SUS SUSTAINABILITY. I WILL GET 60% SOLAR PANELS ON MY ROOF AND I'M GOING TO -- AND I'M ONLY GOING TO PUT IN GAS, AND I WILL PUT IN INFRASTRUCTURE. HE GOES TO STAFF AND SAYS, YOU KNOW, I SATISFIED THE SUSTAINABILITY COMPONENT. I THINK THERE WOULD BE SOME LEVEL OF BASIS TO SAY, CAN WILL, YOU DO GO ELECTRIFICATION, AND IT'S ONLY IF IT'S NOT ACHIEVABLE AT THAT TIME. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT INTERPRETATION -- MAYBE SOMEBODY ELSE COULD ARGUE AGAINST IT. TRUST ME, PEOPLE TELL ME I'M READING THINGS WRONG ALL THE TIME. THIS IS MORE OF A SEMANTIC THING. I COULD SEE HOW WE COULD ARGUE THAT YOU COULD HAVE DONE COMPLETE ELECTRIFICATION BUT THIS IS -- YOU KNOW, YOU ARE REALLY -- YOU ARE REALLY JUST CHOOSING NOT TO. SO I DON'T THINK YOU SATISFY THE SUSTAINABILITY COMPONENT. I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR YOUR INTERPRETATION ON THAT, BECAUSE I COMPLETELY GET IT. MAYBE SOMEBODY DOES IT JUST BARELY ENOUGH, RIGHT? TO GET IT. I JUST DON'T SEE SOMEBODY WHO DOES 60% AND PUTS IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND DOESN'T FOLLOW THROUGH WITH ANYTHING AND JUST KEEPS IT GAS. BUT I WONDER IF THAT IF COMPLETE ELECTRIFICATION IS NOT ACEVABLE, AND I JUST WONDER HOW THAT DISCUSSION OF, WELL, I COULDN'T DO IT BECAUSE THE COST JUST WASN'T THERE AND THEN WE GET INTO AN ARGUMENT ABOUT THE MORE THANNAL DECREASE -- THE DECRDECREASING MARGIL BENEFITS. I FEEL THAT LACK SHOULD GIVE YOU AND SAY IF YOU CLDN'T DO IT, BUT ARE YOU TELLING MEOU CAN'T DO IT RIGHT NOW? SO THAT'S JUST HAT'S MY ADING. I LL LEAVE IT UP FOR
01:33:26.686: >> Chair Mls: MR. LENA, YOU WE MUTED FOR A MUTE. Planning Mager I THI THAT NOT ACHIEVABLE IS GOING TO BE DIFFICULT TO MEASURE. IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT TO DISPUTE. SO THAT'S WHY I SAID THAT I DON'T -- AT ITS CORE, I DON'T THINK IT REQUIRES FULL ELECTRIFICATION. BUT I THINK IT'S LOST ANY OF THE DIALOGUE. THE BENEFIT IS WE WILL HAVE A LOT OF ELECTRIC POWER BEING GENERATED BECAUSE THESE DEVELOPMENTS WILL TAKE USE OF 60% OF SOLAR COLLECTORS. SO EVEN FROM MY LENS, AT WORST, THE TYPICAL BUILDING IS GOING TO BE SHIFTED TO A MORE SUSTAINABLE MEASURE BECAUSE THERE'S GOING TO BE MORE RENEWABLE POWER GENERATED AT THAT SITE. AND IT'S NOT GOING TO BE IN ANYBODY'S INTEREST TO SAY, WELL, I'M GOING TO MAKE THIS INVESTMENT IN THESE -- SO THE SOLAR COLLECTOR SYSTEM, BUT I'M NOT GOING TO USE IT OR I'M JUST GOING TO SELL IT BACK TO THE GRID BECAUSE OF THE IMBALANCE OF -- THE CURRENT IMBALANCE OF SORT OF IN-FLOW AND OUTFLOW RATES. SO I -- YOU KNOW, I APPRECIATE THE -- I DON'T WANT TO LOSE SIGHT OF THAT FACT THAT, YOU KNOW, INHERENT IN HERE, WE ARE BUILDING A LOT OF RENEWABLE FLEXIBILITY.
01:34:58.745: >> Chair Mills: WELL, AND THE REALITY IS, LIKE, IF YOU CAN TAKE THAT, THAT SOLAR POWER THAT YOU ARE GENERATING AND NOT HAVE TO SELL IT BACK TO THE GRID, LIKE, YOU WANT TO ELECTRIFY AS MUCH AS YOU CAN BECAUSE THAT'S HOW THE SOLAR PANELS PAY FOR THEMSELVES MORE QUI QUICKLY ANDR TIME. IF IT'S ABOUT THE OPERATIONAL COST AND YOU NOW REDUCED YOUR LONG-TERM ENERGY BILLS BECAUSE YOU HAVE MADE THE INVESTMENT UP FRONT IN THE SOLAR PANELS, MEANING THAT YOU ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE TO PAY FOR THEM IN THE FUTURE. I THINK THOSE THINGS ARE COMPATIBLE. I -- LIKE, I MEAN I BROUGHT IT UP, BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT I DO, IS DIG HOLES IN THINGS. I -- AND MAYBE THIS IS JUST ME. I'M TOTALLY READY TO SAY TO PEOPLE, LIKE, NO, IF YOU WANT -- IF YOU WANT TO BE -- IF YOU WANT TO CONSIDER IT A SUSTAINABLE BUILDING, THEN YOU NEED TO GET AN ELECTRIC STOVE OR, YOU KNOW -- WHAT IS THE FANCY ONES? THE MAG NETS, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
01:36:06.813: >> INDUCTION.
01:36:07.480: >> Chair Mills: INDUCTION, THANK YOU. THERE'S MAGNETS INVOLVED. LIKE -- AND SO IT KIND OF BOTHERS ME THAT YOU COULD STILL HAVE A GAS STOVE THROUGH THIS, PERSONALLY, BECAUSE THAT'S -- THE ARGUMENTS AGAINST ELECTRIFICATION OF THAT YOUR DRYER, RIGHT, YOUR HOT WATER HEATER ARE IN MY MIND ARE A LITTLE BIT WEAKER THAN ON YOUR FURNACE. IN IS NEW CONSTRUCTION, THOUGH AND SO I -- I REALLY -- THANK YOU FOR PUSHING US ON THIS, COMMISSIONER DISCH, BECAUSE I -- I WONDER -- EARLIER I WAS SUGGESTING THAT WE SWING IN ONE WAY, WHICH IS LIKE LET'S DO THIS. IT GETS US SOME SOLAR AND THEN WE CAN TIGHTEN IT LATER. THE OTHER WAY TO GO IS TIGHTEN IT NOW AND REQUIRE ALL ELECTRIFICATION ALONG WITH THE 60% SOLAR AND THEN IF YOU DON'T GET ANYBODY TAKING YOU ON THIS, WHAT IT MEANS IS THAT IF THEY WANT THAT EXTRA HEIGHT, THEN THEY WILL PROBABLY NOT GET A VARIANCE FOR VACCINATION HEIGHT, RIGHT -- FORBE EX -- FOR EXTRA HEIGHT, RIGHT? IT MIGHT MEAN THAT PEOPLE ARE BUILDING PARKING THAT HE THEY DON'T WANT TO BUILD. SO THAT'S A RISK IN MY MIND. BUT AGAIN, THEN YOU CAN LOOSEN LIKE I SAID, THE COST OF THINGS WAS GOING ON. THAT CAUSED A LOT OF REACTION. MR. LENART AND THEN I SAW COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN AND THEN COMMISSIONER CLARKE AND THEN COMMISSIONER LEE.
01:37:46.079: >> Planning Manager:  I WAS JUST GOING TO SUGGEST THAT PLANNER DILEO COULD BRAINSTORM HOW THAT SUSTAINABILITY LANGUAGE MIGHT BE AMENDED IF IT WERE TO REQUIRE ELECTRIFICATION. BUT I JUST WANT -- I WANT TO POINT -- I THINK 60% OF SOLAR COLLECTORS IS A BENEFIT. I THINK THAT ELECTRIFICATION IS A BENEFIT. I THINK LINKING THOSE TOGETHER ARE TOTALLY APPROPRIATE BUT WE ARE -- I JUST WANT TO BE MINDFUL WE ARE EXPANDING THE GATEWAY THAT YOU NEED TO ACHIEVE TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THIS, WHICH IS FIND IF THAT -- IF THAT -- I THINK -- I THINK WHAT THAT COMES DOWN TO IF WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT ONE OR THE OTHER BY THEMSELVES, IF THAT LANGUAGE IS AMENDED IS APPROPRIATE TO MEET OUR GOAL OF SUSTAINABILITY, THEN IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE. IF IT -- IF MEETING THAT GOAL IS ONLY BY THE COUPLING OF THOSE TWO TOGETHER, THEN SO BE IT. SO --
01:39:02.422: >> Chair Mills: COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN AND THEN COMMISSIONER CLARKE.
01:39:07.760: >> Commissioner Milshteyn: SO I THINK GOING DOWN THE PATH, COMMISSIONER MILLS, I THINK IT'S A GOOD PATH TO GO, BUT I DON'T THINK THIS IS THE TIME FOR IT. MY CONCERN IS THAT IT'S SORT OF LIKE A DOWNTOWN PREMIUMS. -- REMEMBER HOW WE WORKED FOR A LONGTIME ON DOWNTOWN PREMIUMS. MS. DILEO, YOU WORKED WITH US FOR YEARS ON THE DOWNTOWN PREMIUMS AND WE CAME UP WITH THIS AMAZING DOWNTOWN PREMIUMS AMENDMENT AND IT WAS BEAUTIFUL. HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF IT? I'M PRETTY SURE IT'S ZERO THE LAST TIME WE ACTUALLY CHECKED. SO MY CONCERN IS I KNOW THIS IS WELL INTENDED, BUT WE DON'T WANT TO MAKE IT SO -- WE DON'T WANT TO GO DOWN THIS RODE TO SAY WE HAVE SPENT ALL OF THIS TIME AND WE ARE WAY AHEAD OF OUR TIME. I THINK WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW IS GOING TO BE BETTER. I THINK WE SHOULD CONTINUE DOWN THIS PATH AND SORT OF NOTE IT AND WHEN THE TIME COMES BACK NOTE IT. SO THAT'S MY THOUGHT.
01:40:23.203: >> Chair Mills: THANK YOU, COMMISSIONER CLARKE.
01:40:25.004: >> Commissioner Clarke: I WAS GOING TO SAY SETTING THE ELECTRIFICATION TOO HIGH, IT INCREASES THE COSTS, AND THEN IT REMOVES -- YEAH, THINGS LIKE INDUCTION STOVES, THEY ARE STILL EXPENSIVE AND THEN WHEN THEY ARE FEASIBLE, IT'S NOT NECESSARILY SOMETHING THAT ALL DEVELOPERS ARE SUPER FLUENT AND COMFORTABLE IN GOING AND, YOU NO HE -- AND THEN THE OTHER THING WOULD BE LIKE HALLWAY HEATING COSTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. USUALLY IT'S THE TENANTS THAT ARE PAYING UTILITY BILLS AND IT'S SOMETHING TO BE MINDFUL OF THAT IT'S A HIGH RATE IF IT'S -- DEPENDING ON THE SYSTEM AND JUST MAKE SURE WHO IS UTILIZING APPLIANCES. THAT'S IT.
01:41:06.279: >> Chair Mills: COMMISSIONER LEE. YOU HAD YOUR HAND UP EARLIER TOO.
01:41:09.782: >> Commissioner Lee: I WILL SECOND WHAT COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN AND CLARKE JUST SAID, THAT I THINK IT MIGHT BE -- WE WILL MIGHT BE MAKING IT TOO ONEROUS AND THAT I WOULD BE OKAY. I WOULD BE IN FAVOR OF SUPPORTING THIS IN ITS CURRENT FORM. I'M JUST THINKING OF A DEVELOPER THAT'S BUILDING SOMETHING THAT'S BIGGER THAN 2500 SQUARE FEET, AND 26 FEET AND THEN JUST SAYING, WELL, I WILL NOT FURNISH IT, HEIGHT? IT SEEMS LIKE AN OVERREACH AT A CERTAIN POINT. I WANT TO BE REALISTIC ABOUT THE APPROACH. AGAIN, I CERTAINLY AM IN SUPPORT OF THE INTENT BEHIND IT, BUT I DO THINK -- COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN, YOU HAVE A LOT OF HISTORY HERE. WE WANT THIS TO BE -- I THINK THE END GOAL OF 60% OF ROOFS BEING SOLAR POWERED IS A GOOD ENOUGH ENDING ON ITS OWN. SO THAT WOULD BE MY COMMENT.
01:42:10.977: >> Chair Mills: COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT.
01:42:12.912: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: THIS WAS AN INTERESTING DISCUSSION. LIKE COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN, I WOULD PREFER MORE EDUCATION ON THE ELECTRIFICATION. IF MY MEMORY SERVES ME CORRECTLY, I FEEL LIKE WE HAD PRETTY GOOD LUCK WHEN WE PUSHED DEVELOPERS TO CONSIDER ELECTRIFICATION IN A COUPLE OF RECENT PROJECTS. I THINK THERE'S PROBABLY A LOT MORE EDUCATION THAT THEY NEED AROUND THIS AS WELL. I THINK SOLAR IS PRETTY WELL UNDERSTOOD. BUT I THINK WE BROUGHT UP ELECTRIFICATION TO ONE DEVELOPER AND HE WASN'T CLEAR WHAT WE WERE REFERRING TO. SORT OF OUR STOPGAP IS PASSING THIS 60% SOLAR, ELECTRIFICATION READY AND THEN SORT OF, YOU KNOW -- IN OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH THE DEVELOPER TRY TO, YOU KNOW, PUSH THAT YOU SHOULD ALSO CONSIDER THIS AND JUST SORT OF SEE WHAT THAT UPTAKE LOOKS LIKE. AND THEN MAYBE IF PEOPLE ARE JUST KIND OF DOING IT, WE CAN REQUIRE IT IN THE FUTURE IF THINGS CHANGE. YEAH, I'M HAVING TROUBLE WITH NOT REQUIRING THAT RIGHT NOW.
01:43:20.446: >> Chair Mills: COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL.
01:43:21.381: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: I THINK THIS LAST PIECE, IF IT'S NOT ACHIEVABLE AT THE TIME. INITIAL CONSTRUCTION. I THINK IT WOULD BE A REAL CHEAT TO SAY WE WILL HAVE GAS STOVES. AN ELECTRIC STOVE IS CHEAPER THAN A GAS STOVE IS. I THINK THAT THAT'S A NO -- LIKE, THERE'S SOME THINGS THAT COME ON, YOU CAN DO THIS. I THINK THE THING THAT IS STILL -- AND I DON'T KNOW A LOT ABOUT THIS, BUT I DO KNOW ABOUT THE HEAT PUMP, IS THAT IT VARIES BUILDING FORM TO BILLING FORM AND CLIMATE AND ALL KINDS OF THINGS AND SO THAT IS THE PART THAT FEELS THE MUSHIEST RIGHT NOW IN HOW TO HANDLE BUILDING ENERGY. I THINK IT'S A RAPIDLY DEVELOPING FIELD. AND THAT'S THE PIECE THAT I -- REMEMBER, LIKE IN THE LAST ONE THAT WE APPROVED ON NORTH MAIN, THE CENTER UNITS WERE FINE, BUT THE OUTSIDE UNITS GOT TRICKY. IT'S REALLY, I THINK, GOING TO DEPEND ON ALL KINDS OF THINGS IN TERMS OF BUILDING FORM AND SIDING AND STUFF LIKE THAT. I WOULD LIKE TO PUSH THEM ON THE LOW HANGING FRUIT, LIKE NOT HAVING A GAS STOVE, BUT THAT THE FLEXIBILITY COMES IN WITH THE -- ESPECIALLY SOME OF THE HEATING SYSTEMS THAT ARE STILL VERY MU IN DEVELOPMENT IN THAT WAY. MY ONE MISGIVING, THE ONE ON WASHINGTON THAT WAS REALLY, REALLY TALL AND A DIFFERENT SETUP. I MEAN, THAT THING IS TALL AND TINY. IT'S SKINNY AND 60% OF THEIR ROOF WOULD -- YOU KNOW, POWER THE LOBBY. AND THAT'S IT, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? SO I THINK WE'RE SORTF IMAGINING THESE DIFFERENT RUCTURES AND THEY REALLY CLD BE -- I MEAN, MAYBE WHAT WE DO IS A DIFFERENT DEAL THAN WHAT THIS WOULD BE USED FOR, BUT IT'S LIKE WE ARE SORT OFMAGINING AT 60% WL DOOMETHING. BUT I THE BLDING FORM IS TALL AND SKINNY THEN IT WON'T DO A WHOLE LOT ANDE WLD WT THE VE I FWA AIT I BUT IE CAN GUESS WHA I WOULD WANT IS THAT WITH STAFF AS THEY ARE MEETING WITH DEVELOPERS BEFORE THEY PUT OTHER PLANS TOGETHER THAT YOU MAKE IT REALLY CLEAR TO THEM THAT IF IT'S NOT REALLY ACHIEVABLE, IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. WELL, I WANT TO DO GAS STOVES BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE MARK -- MARKETPLACE WANTS. THERE'S SOME REALLY NICE ELECTRIC STOVES OUT THERE TOO. BUT JUST PUSH THEM ON IT IN SOME WAYS, BUT I REALLY WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MORE EDUCATION ON THIS. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHOEVER YOU CHOOSE FOR THAT IS NOT JUST FAMILIAR WITH SINGLE-FAMILY HOME, BUT MULTIFAMILY AND COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS TOO, MR. LENART AS YOU ARE PUTTING THAT TOGETHER, BECAUSE THEY ARE DIFFERENT ANIMALS IN A LOT OF WAYS. OR WE GET A VARIETY OF EXPERTISE IN THERE BECAUSE WE SEE A VARIETY OF WHO THIS IS FOR AND I THINK THE SOLUTIONS CAN BE REALLY DIFFERENT WITH DIFFERENT THINGS. YOU CAN CONTROL YOUR OFFICE SETTING IN TERMS OF HOW PEOPLE HANDLE THEIR HEAT AND ALL OF THAT TYPE OF THING AND BECAUSE YOU HAVE A LANDLORD AND THAT KIND OF THING, BUT WITH THE -- YOU KNOW, APARTMENTS OR CONDOS OR WHATEVER, IT'S UP TO PEOPLE TO DO THEIR OWN THINGS AND THEY CAN HAVE REALLY DIFFERENT IMPACTS ON THINGS. SO WHEN WE DO GET TO THAT POINT, I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A VARIETY OF EXPERTISE REPORTING TO US THAT REFLECT THE VARIETY OF BUILDING TYPES THAT WE HAVE. SO -- BUT YOU -- BUT BRETT LOOKED LIKE HE WAS RESPONDING TO SOMETHING I WAS SAYING. LANZ SAYING.>> Planning ManagerE WASHINGTON EXAMPLE IS A GREAT JUAN. IN THIS CASE IF YOU PROVIDED THE 60%, THAT ONLY GIVES YOU THE HEIGHT, WHEREAS THAT PROJECT ACTUALLY GOT AN F.A.R. BENEFIT. I APPRECIATE YOUR REFERENCE. IT WON'T GIVE IT THE SAME BENEFIT TO GET TO THE SAME CURRENT CONFIGURATIONS.
01:48:06.165: >> Chair Mills: JUST FOR OTHERS AND CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG, THE F.A.R. THAT IT GOT, I MEAN UNDER CURRENT CODE TO GET THAT F.A.R. BECAUSE WHAT ALEX WAS SAYING -- OR COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN WAS SAYING BEFORE, WE WANTED A LOT. WOULD YOU HAVE TO PROVIDE -- THAT BUILDING WOULDN'T GET THAT F.A.R. ANY MORE. THEY HAVE TO PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING OR, I GUESS PAY INTO THE FUND. ACTUALLY -- RIGHT, IT'S SIGNIFICANT.
01:48:31.457: >> Planning Manager:  UNITS. WOULD YOU HAVE TO PROVIDE SOME UNITS, BUT THERE WAS AN OPTION TO MAKE A CONTRIBUTION FOR A PORTION OF THEM.
01:48:42.668: >> Chair Mills: YEAH. AND CONSEQUENTLY WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANY OTHER PROPOSALS.
01:48:50.042: >> Planning Manager:  I TOTALLY AGREE WITH THAT AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I WANT TO MONITOR, BUT THE PAST YEAR IS NOT THE BEST MEASURE.
01:49:00.086: >> Chair Mills: COMMISSIONER LEE, I SAW YOUR HAND UP.
01:49:03.022: >> Commissioner Lee: YES, THIS IS JUST FOR STAFF. I WANT TO RECOMMEND THAT WE SPEAK WITH DAVID EVEREST. HE DID OUR ENERGY AUDIT. HE'S A Ph.D. HE BASICALLY -- HE WORKS AT SEIMEN'S AND WE TALKED WITH THE PAYOFFS WITH ELECTRIFICATION, WHICH CAN TAKE 20 TO 30 YEARS. WE TALKED ABOUT OTHER FINANCING SOURCES, BUT I WILL SEND YOU HIS CONTACT INFORMATION. HE SEEMED VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE. AND THE OTHER POINT, -- SO I WILL SEND YOU THAT RESOURCE AND HE'S ACTUALLY A GUY THAT'S NOT JUST OPEN GOOGLE. HE'S BEEN DOING THIS FOR LIKE 30 YEARS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND VERY UP TO DATE ON THE LATEST. AND THEN THE OTHER THING THAT I JUST WANT TO ALSO MENTION THAT -- I HAVE GONE THROUGH THE PROCESS TO TRY TO INCREASE THE ENERGY GRID FOR ONE OF OUR OFFICE BUILDINGS. D.T.E. IS THE 800-POUND GORILLA IN THE ROOM. THEY TAKE A LONG TIME TO RESPOND. SO BY PUSHING FOR ELECTRIFICATION, OF WHICH SUSTAINABILITY GOALS AND FUTUREPROOFING IS VERY IMPERATIVE, I WANT TO SAY THAT, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE TO BE ALSO MINDFUL TO A CERTAIN EXTENT CAPACITY OF THE ELECTRIC GRID, THAT'S EXISTING AND THAT MAKES -- WASHTENAW COUNTY IS GROWING RAPIDLY -- LET ME RETRACT THAT. IT'S GROWING STEADILY. IT'S NOT AWESOME TEXAS, BUT IT'S SLOW AND STEADY. WE HAVE A SHORTAGE AND WE HAVE AN IMBALANCE OF TRADES. IF WE WANT TO OVER UTILIZE IT. -- I WANT PEOPLE, JUST THE LITTLE ANECDOTE. IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS. IT COST OVER HALF A MILLION DOLLARS AND IT WAS ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE WE WANT HAVE ENOUGH ELECTRICITY. IT WAS ALSO FOR A VERY SPECIFIC ACTUALLY COMMERCIAL USE. I DON'T KNOW IF RESIDENTIAL WOULD DEMAND THAT LEVEL OF POWER, BUT I WANT PEOPLE TO BE COGNIZANT OF ELECTRIFY, ELECTRIFY, ELECTRIFY. THERE'S FINITE AMOUNT OF ELECTRICITY IN A GRID AT A CERTAIN POINT AND THE SOLAR WILL HELP AND WE SHOULD ALL PUSH TOWARDS THAT. I THINK ENCOURAGING SOLAR MAKES SENSE IN THIS PARTICULAR INSTANCE.
01:51:27.533: >> Chair Mills: JUST TO THAT POINT FOR THE NEW COMMISSIONERS THAT WERE NOT PART OF THIS DISCUSSION SIX MONTHS AGO, WHEN THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE ORDINANCE CAME BEFORE US, THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT GOT BROUGHT UP. AND PART OF THE -- A COMMITTEE THAT WAS SET UP ON ELECTRIC COMMISSION THAT WAS LIKE DRAFTING THAT ORDINANCE, I SAT IN ON IT AND HAD D.T.E. DO SOME ANALYSIS BECAUSE THE COST OF THE HOOKUP AND THE ADDITIONAL CAPACITY IS SOMETHING THAT BROUGHT UP. AND WHAT D.T.E. TOLD US AGAIN AND AGAIN IS THAT RETROFITTING IS REALLY EXPENSIVE. BUILD IT IN FROM THE BEGINNING AND THAT'S AMONG THE REASONS THAT I THINK WE ARE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. TO SAY YOU -- WHEN YOU ARE BUILDING THIS NEW CONSTRUCTION AND THE VAST MAJORITY OF THINGS THAT WILL FALL UNDER THIS ORDINANCE IS NEW CONSTRUCTION. YOU ARE ALREADY HAVING TO PAY, YOU KNOW, UPGRADE YOUR SERVICE, DON'T DO IT. YOU WILL HAVE TO DO IN THE LONG RUN. IT WILL HELP US ALL COLLECT LIVELY, YOU KNOW, WE KNOW THAT WE ARE MOVING THAT DIRECTION ANYWAY, AND BUILDING IT IN EARLIER MAKES SENSE. COMING BACK TO THE QUESTION THAT COMMISSIONER DISCH ASKED AND I CAN ARGUE BOTH SIDES. I THINK I'M SWAYED BY THE ARGUMENTS MADE THAT THIS IS GOOD. THIS IS A GOOD FIRST STEP. LET'S SEE WHERE IT GOES. I THINK I HEARD A CONTINUED CALL FOR MORE EDUCATION ON THE ELECTRIFICATION. EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT ALWAYS IN OUR LANE, IT COMES UP A LOT AND IT INTERSECTS WITH A LOT OF THE STUFF AND SINCE IT'S INTEGRAL INTO THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT, THAT'S PART OF WHAT WE ARE DOING AND TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN USE SOME CARROTS THAT WE HAVE THROUGH ZONING, RIGHT, TO -- TO GET THINGS THAT MAYBE AREN'T HISTORICALLY, YOU KNOW, PART OF WHAT IS OUR LANE, I THINK IT -- IT -- WHAT I'M HEARING FROM YOU IS THAT, LIKE, YES, I SHOULD PUT SOME MORE ATTENTION TO WORKING WITH MR. LENART TO DO THAT EDUCATION, NOT JUST FOR US, BUT INCREASINGLY WHAT I WAS HEARING AND AT LEAST THE WAY I HAD SCOPED IT OUT AND KIND OF ASKED FOR SOME MORE INFORMATION, IS USE US AS THE GUINEA PIG TO GIVE US INFORMATION THAT WOULD THEN BE USED FOR PUBLIC EDUCATION CAMPAIGN, RIGHT? BECAUSE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT, I THINK, WOULD BE HELPFUL. SO I'M SUMMARIZING. I THINK THERE'S MUSHY LANGUAGE AT THE END OF THAT SUSTAINABILITY PART THAT -- THAT MAY GET US SOME GAS STOVES BUNT I EXPECT US TO REVISIT THIS IN NOT TOO LONG OF A TIME. I'M OKAY WITH IT AS IS. COMMISSIONER DISCH.
01:54:15.034: >> Councilmember Disch: I WANTED TO SAY THANK YOU. I WANTED TO HEAR MORE DELIBERATIONS AND MORE ARGUMENTS BECAUSE I HAVEN'T BEEN HERE AND I APPRECIATE YOU ALL DOING THAT.
01:54:26.412: >> Chair Mills: AND NOW SINCE WE DELIBERATED IT, YOU CAN SHOW BOTH SIDES WHEN IT GOES ON TO COUNCIL AND SAY WE TALKED ABOUT THIS AND LET ME TELL YOU. SO -- AND OUR MEETINGS WILL NOT GO TO 1:30. SO WE CAN GET THAT DELIBERATION DONE HERE SO IT CAN BE SHORTER AT CITY COUNCIL. ANYTHING ELSE BEFORE I ASK FOR A ROLL CALL VOTE? MR. LEONARD, PLEASE.
01:54:54.073: >> Commissioner Milshteyn: YES.
01:54:54.740: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: YES.
01:54:59.078: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: YES.
01:55:04.683: >> Councilmember Disch: YES.
01:55:08.720: >> Commissioner Lee: YES.
01:55:11.690: >> Chair Mills: WE DIDN'T HEAR YOU.
01:55:14.093: >> Commissioner Clarke: YELL. I'M SORRY.
01:55:15.394: >> Chair Mills: YES.
01:55:15.861: >> Planning Manager:  MOTION CARRIES.
01:55:19.465: >> Chair Mills: EXCELLENT. THANKS, MS. DILEO.
01:55:24.603: >> YOU'RE WELCOME.
01:55:26.438: >> Chair Mills: WE HAVE TWO MORE ITEMS OF BUSINESS. CAN WE TAKE A QUICK WATER BREAK. IT'S ALMOST 9:00. CAN WE COME BACK AT 9:05. PERFECT. ALL RIGHT. WE'LL SEE YOU THEN. [ BREAK ]
02:04:41.759: >> Chair Mills: 11A, THIS IS COMMITTEE BUSINESS. MR. LENART.
02:04:44.162: >> Planning Manager:  YES, WE HAVE LONGSTANDING SUBCOMMITTEES THAT HAVE BEEN TYPICALLY COMPRISES SOLELY OF PLANNING COMMISSIONERS. WE ALSO HAVE DESIGNEES OF THE PLANNING COMMISSION TO OTHER GROUPS. AND WE HAVE A COUPLE OF NEW ONES TO DICUSS. THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING SUBCOMMITTEE, CURRENTLY, IT IS NOT MET FOR A WHILE. IT WAS ORIGINALLY CONCEIVED AS AN INTERSECOND BETWEEN THE CITY'S HOUSING AND SERVICES ADVISORY BOARD WITH ADVOCATES FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSES, SORT OF SAFETY NET SUPPORT, AND THE PLANNING COMMISSION. CURRENTLY WE HAVE TWO MEMBERS DESIGNATED ON THAT. THE MASTER PLAN REVIEW COMMITTEE. SUBCOMMITTEE. WE RECENTLY TRIED TO UNDERTAKE A FULL UPDATE TO OUR MASTER PLAN. WE WEREN'T ABLE TO DO THAT. SO I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO GET THIS COMMITTEE SORT OF ACTIVATED AND -- AND TALKING TO THINK ABOUT WAYS THAT WE CAN SORT OF PERHAPS LOOK AT UPDATING OUR MASTER PLAN AND SORT OF MORE MANAGEABLE CHUNKS BUT I WILL SAY THAT GENERALLY I FEEL LIKE WE HAVE A LOT OF ORDINANCE WORK ON OUR PLATE RIGHT NOW. I THINK IT'S CONCEIVABLE THAT THAT GETS SORT OF PUSHED BACK LATER IN OUR WORK. THE ORDINANCE REVISION COMMITTEE IS A COMMISSION THAT HAS FOUR COMMISSIONERS. THEY MEET ON THE FOURTH TUESDAY EVER EACH MONTH BECAUSE HAVING YOUR FIRST TWO TUESDAYS IS NOT ENOUGH OBLIGATION. AND THAT GROUP HELPS STAFF AND THE AB COMMISSION TO WORK THROUH THE DETAILS AN EXPLORE THE LANGUAGE THAT ULTIMATELY ARRIVES ON THE FULL PLANNING COMMISSION AGENDA AS HOPEFULLY MORE FULLY FORMED ORDINANCE AMENDMENTS. THEN WE HAVE A COUPLE OF RELATIONSHIPS THROUGH DESIGNEES. THESE ARE TYPICALLY INDIVIDUALS TO OTHER GROUPS. WE HAVE THE D.D.A. PARTNERSHIPS COMMITTEE, WHICH COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL MENTIONED SHE'S THE CURRENT DESIGNEE. THAT IS AN INTERSECT OF A WIDE VARIETY OF FOLKS THAT SHARE INFORMATION OBVIOUSLY FOCUSED OPEN THE DOWNTOWN DISTRICT. COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL IS ALSO CURRENTLY OUR DEZ EGG KNEE- DESIGNEE TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION. WE HAVE A SPOT THAT IS CURRENTLY UNDESIGNATED. A DESIGNEE FROM THE PLANNING TO THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION. THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY COMMISSIONER WOODS WOULD RESIGNED FROM THE COMMISSION. SO THAT IS A VACANCY. AND THEN, LISTED ON THE APPOINTMENTS IS ALSO THE ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS. SO STATE LAW PROVIDES THAT A PLANNING COMMISSIONER CAN JOINTLY SERVE BOTH ON THE ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS AND THE PLANNING COMMISSION. IT'S NOT REQUIRED. I WILL NOTE THAT CURRENTLY THE ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS IS A FULL BOARD. HOWEVER, IF THERE WAS A PLANNING COMMISSION INTERESTED IN THAT ROLE, THAT CAN PROVIDE SOME SORT OF CONTINUITY OF THOSE PROJECTS THAT ARE SEEKING SOME ACTION AT BOTH BOARDS. BUT THE ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS AS COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN CAN ATTEST ALSO CONSIDERS A HIGH VOLUME OF PETITIONS THAT AREN'T RELATED TO PLANNING COMMISSION ACTION AS WELL. A COUPLE OF NEW ADDITIONS TO THIS PROPOSED ASSIGNMENT, CHART AND DISCUSSION ARE -- WE TALKED ABOUT THIS A LITTLE BIT AT THE MEETING, AND IN OUR WORK PLAN. ULTIMATE ELEVATORRING A CONVERSATION ABOUT THE -- CULTIVATING A CONVERSATION ABOUT THE CITY DOANING IN THE HISTORY. I THINK WHAT I HEARD FROM THE PLANNING COMMISSION, REFLECTED IN THE WORK PLAN, THIS MIGHT BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND OUR SUBCOMMITTEE HORSEPOWER BEYOND THE MEMBERS OF THIS PLANNING COMMISSION. SO I DON'T KNOW IF WE'LL ARRIVE AT ANY SPECIFICS BUT I WOULD LOVE FOR US TO START EXPLORING HOW YOU ENVISION SELECTING, PUTTING TOGETHER THAT COMMITTEE, HOW IT MIGHT HELP US CRAFT THAT COMMUNITYONVERSATION GOING RWARD. AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE THROUGH ACTION OFHE CITY COUIL, A I THINK THIS WAS INCLUDED IN THE SUMMARY PROVIDED IS PLANNING COMMISSION DESIGNE TO THE CENTER OF THE CITY INITIING COMMITTEE ANDHIS IS A FOLLOWING  A FOLLOW-UP O THE CENTER O THE CITY TASK FORCE WHICHADE A SERIE OF RECOMMENTIONS FOR USE OF TH-- BASICALLYN TOP O THE BRARY PARKIN STRTURE AND AT ENTIR BLOCK. AT WOULD BE A PLANNING COMMISONELECTING A MEMBER TO PUT FORWA WHOOULD ULTATELY BE AFFIRME AND SELTED BY THE GROUP.OUNC TOERVE O THA D I DON'T PFESS TO BE AN PERT ON THAT GROUP, B THE GOALF THAT IS TO SRT VELOPING THE ST OF PLEMENTING STEPS THAT THE TK FORCE IDENTIFIE FOR CTIVATING THAT AS A TRUEOMMUNITY COMMON BOTH IN SORT OF YSICALITY AND- AND PROGRAING A    I PHILOSOPH AUT HOW THPACE COULD BE USED. SO IDEALLY AT THE END OF THIS, YOU GUYS ALL FIGURE OUT WHO WANTS TO BE WHERE, AND I MAKE NOTES ON THIS TABLE AND THEN YOU MAKE A MOTION TO APPROVE IT.
02:10:09.287: >> Chair Mills: SO I STILL -- DO YOU HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT WHAT WE ARE DOING COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL? #.
02:10:14.258: >> Com>> Commissioner Gibb-RandE D.D.A. PARTNERSHIPS GREW HAS CHANGED ITS NAME. IT'S NOW THE AFFORDABILITY -- IT'S STILL THE D.D.A. BUT THE AFFORDABILITY/ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE. AND SO IT'S -- BUT IT'S JUST THE D.D.A. IT'S NOT FOR THE CITY IN GENERAL, BUT JENNIFER HALL AND --
02:10:40.318: >> Planning Manager:  YOU HAD MENTIONED THAT BEFORE AND I DIDN'T UPDATE THE TABLE.
02:10:44.088: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: JUST SO YOU REALIZE. I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT DOVETAILS OR NOT WITH THAT AFFORDABILITY GROUP THAT YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT GETTING GO GOING TOO.
02:10:57.101: >> Chair Mills: IN TERMS OF PROCESS, MR. LENART, WE DON'T HAVE A PUBLIC HEARING, BECAUSE THIS IS OUR OTHER BUSINESS. I'M GOING TO READ THE MOTION. WE'RE GOING TO AMEND IT, RIGHT -- WE'RE GOING TO TELL YOU HOW TO AMEND IT AS WE GO AND THEN WE'LL VOTE ON WHAT ALL OF THOSE AMENDMENTS THAT WE PUT ON THERE? AND FOR MY PERSPECTIVE, THESE NEED NOT BE -- YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO A FORMAL AMENDMENT PROCESS. WE'RE TAKING IT AS A WHOLE. SO THE MOTION READS THE ANN ARBOR PLANNING COMMISSION APPROVES THE PLANNING COMMISSION SUBCOMMITTEE AND DESIGNEE ASSIGNMENTS, MOVED BY COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN, SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT. NOW WE ARE IN DISCUSSION SO WE CAN FILL OUT THE TABLE. COMMISSIONER LEE.
02:11:47.385: >> Commissioner Lee: I -- SO DO WE LIKE WRESTLE FOR THIS OR HOW DO -- I GUESS I WILL PUT MY PREFERENCES OUT THERE. I THINK MY SKILLS WOULD BE BEST SERVED EITHER ON THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION OR THE ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS. SO MY SUBCONCENTRATION IN THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT WAS TRANSPORTATION, AND I SERVED ON THE ACTUAL CITIZEN TRANSPORTATION, LIKE ADVISORY BOARD. SO I'M FAMILIAR WITH THE PLANS ALREADY. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT DIVERSIFIES. I WANT TO THROW THOSE TWO. I UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE OPEN ALREADY. I UNDERSTAND THE ZBA IS FULL, BUT HOPEFULLY THAT AT LEAST THROWS OUT IF ANYBODY WANTS TO WRESTLE, I'M GAME.
02:12:32.363: >> Chair Mills: I DON'T THINK YOU WILL BE GETTING ANYBODY WRESTLING WITH YOU FROM ZBA, UNLESS COMMISSIONER CLARKE HAS DIFFERENT PREFERENCES. [ LAUGHTER ] GREAT! WE GOT TWO BOXES FILLED IN!
02:12:52.049: >> Planning Manager:  DON'T EVERYBODY JUMP IN AT ONCE.
02:12:55.286: >> Chair Mills: COMMISSIONER
02:12:56.721: >> Commissioner Milshteyn: MR. L ENART, DO WE HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT THE TIME COMMITMENT IS FOR THE CENTER OF THE CITY INITIATING COMMITTEE?
02:13:06.097: >> Planning Manager:  I DON'T. AT THIS POINT, I BELIEVE I ASKED AND THE GROUP IS STILL BEING ORGANIZED. I THINK AT THIS POINT IT WILL BE A MONTHLY MEETING, AND IT IS TENTATIVELY IT LOOKS LIKE IT WILL BE THE SECOND THURSDAY OF THE MONTH IN THE EVENING, PROBABLY AROUND 6:00 OR 7:00 IS MY UNDERSTANDING. SO I WOULD GUESS IT WOULD BE A MONTHLY MEETING WITH PROBABLY SOME WORK IN BETWEEN. PROBABLY NOT AS HEAVY A LOAD AS YOU AS THE PLANNING COMMISSIONER, BUT PROBABLY SOME DEGREE OF -- OF EXTERNAL WORK BEYOND THE MEETINGS THEMSELVES. AND I -- AND I WOULD SAY PART OF THAT IS THAT -- I THINK THAT COMMITTEE IS BEING FORMED. SO I THINK PART OF THAT WILL BE DETERMINED BY THAT COMMITTEE ITSELF, HOW IT WANTS TO SEPARATE. I THINK IT'S GOING -- OPERATES. I THINK IT WILL BE STAFFED BY HEATHER SEYFARTH. SHE ALSO WORKED THE TASK FORCE. SHE'S FANTASTIC! SO I THINK IT SHOULD BE A GOOD GROUP. CHALLENGING ISSUE FOR SURE, THOUGH.
02:14:15.900: >> Chair Mills: WERE YOU VOLUNTEERING, COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN? NO. COMMISSIONER CLARKE, WAS THAT A HAND? OKAY.
02:14:30.915: >> Commissioner Clarke: I WAS JUST GOING TO LIKE MR. LEE THROW OUT, I GUESS, WHERE I THINK I COULD BE OF USE, IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING MIGHT MAKE SENSE. I HAVE ALSO BEEN INTERESTED IN, LIKE, THE MASTER PLAN COMMITTEE AND I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE OF ALL THE DETAILS OF SINGLE FAMILY ZONING COMMITTEE BUT THAT KIND OF SEEMS LIKE IT WOULD TIE INTO MY BACKGROUND PRETTY WELL. TRANSPORTATION, BUT I FEEL LIKE THERE'S A BIT OF INTEREST THERE ALREADY. THAT'S IT.
02:15:07.752: >> Chair Mills: GREAT. AND HONESTLY, LIKE, YOU CAN SEE ON THESE BOXES, EVERYBODY HAG A COUPLE, LIKE -- HAS A COUPLE, LIKE TWO OR THREE. THAT SOUNDS REASONABLE. I DON'T THINK ANY OF THOSE OVER TAPPED. SO COMMISSIONER DISCH?
02:15:26.671: >> Councilmember Disch: YEAH. I -- I FEEL LIKE THERE ARE LIMITS TO HOW MUCH I CAN TAKE ON, BECAUSE OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION AND THE SOLID WASTE WORKING GROUP AND THE ZERO WASTE WORKING GROUP, WHICH I THINK ARE SORT OF FOLDING TOGETHER, BUT THAT'S GOOD. BUT THE -- CERTAINLY THE SINGLE FAMILY ZONING -- IT MIGHT BE -- I MEAN I WOULD LOVE TO JUST HAVE THAT CALLED THE COMMUNITY CONVERSATIONS COMMITTEE, SO THAT IT WOULDN'T HAVE TO BE SO CHARGED AND HOT BUTTON. AND I -- I DEFINITELY WOULD LIKE TO DO THAT. YEAH. I'M ALREADY ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION. SO COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL AND I BOTH HAVE THAT COVERED, WHICH I THINK IS REALLY GOOD. BUT I DON'T -- I PROBABLY CAN'T -- I'M NOT ALLOWED TO COUNT THAT BECAUSE I'M ALREADY DOING IT.
02:16:22.360: >> Chair Mills: WE USUALLY GIVE -- I FEEL LIKE WE HAVE GIVEN OUR COUNCIL REP A PASS. LIKE, HAVING -- BEING ON ONE OF THE OTHERS -- SO DON'T FEEL OVERTAXED, ESPECIALLY, YOU KNOW THIS IS YOUR FIRST -- YOUR FIRST YEAR TOO.
02:16:37.341: >> Councilmember Disch: YEAH, YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ]
02:16:41.278: >> Planning Manager:  ALL RIGHT. SO I THINK THERE'S MORE COMMUNICATION ABOUT COMMUNITY CONVERSATIONS OR SINGLE FAMILY ZONING. I THINK THAT WARRANTS SOME DISCUSSION AS A COMMITTEE, BUT I WOULD SAY PROBABLY THE MOST IMMEDIACY IS THE CENTER OF THE CITY INITIATING COMMITTEE MEMBER.
02:17:03.968: >> Chair Mills: ANYONE INTERESTED? I HATE TO SIGN UP THE PEOPLE THAT AREN'T HERE. I FEEL LIKE I DID GET AN EMAIL FROM ONE OF THEM SAY, OH, I COULD DO WHATEVER! BUT THAT'S KIND OF --
02:17:22.253: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: WELL, IF THEY SAID IT -- [ LAUGHTER ]
02:17:28.092: >> Chair Mills: MAKE I SHOULD GO OUT AND DIG OUT HER EMAIL IT WAS AS OPEN ENDED AS WHAT I REMEMBER. [ LAUGHTER ]
02:17:36.867: >> Planning Manager:  YEAH, I MEAN, I THINK -- I THINK THEY ARE INTERESTED IN GETTING THAT COMMITTEE GOING. I APPRECIATE EVERYBODY ALREADY HAS A HEAVY LIFT. YOU KNOW, BUT I THINK -- I THINK THAT THE COUNCIL WOULD VALUE IF WE COULD FIND SOMEBODY. I WILL LEAVE IT TO YOU HOW MUCH YOU WANT TO PRESUME ON YOUR COLLEAGUES. LIKE, COMMISSIONER ABRONS. I THINK SHE SAID SHE WAS GENERALLY HAPPY WITH HER APPOINTMENTS, WHICH ARE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE, WHICH IS JUST COMPRISED OF THE CHAIR, THE VICE CHAIR AND THE SECRETARY. BUT I THINK IT WOULD -- IT WOULD BE HELPFUL IF WE COULD MAYBE IDENTIFY AT LEAST -- IF WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT IT, MAYBE IDENTIFY A FIRST UP, A FIRST CHOICE AND A SECOND CHOICE MAYBE DEPENDING IF SOMEBODY IS NOT AVAILABLE.
02:18:40.064: >> Chair Mills: COMMISSIONER DISCH?
02:18:41.632: >> Councilmember Disch: THIS IS JUST A QUESTION AND IT'S PURELY JUST A -- JUST A QUESTION. JUST A THOUGHT. YEAH, I'M -- I'M LOOKING AT THIS TABLE AND I'M LOOKING AT A LOT OF REALLY -- THESE ARE DEMANDING SUBCOMMITTEES, AND THE PLANNING COMMISSION ITSELF IS QUITE DEMANDING. AND I KNOW LIKE THIS IS PROBABLY NOT AT ALL FEASIBILITY, BUT IT JUST OCCURS TO ME THAT COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS IS ON THE CENTER OF THE CITY COMMITTEE. I WONDER IF SHE COULD BE A REPORTING MEMBER TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION BECAUSE SHE SERVED ON PLANNING COMMISSION. SHE HAS H THAT EXPERTISE. I WONDER IF THAT WOULD BE A FEASIBLE SUBSTITUTE IF IT TURNS OUT THAT THE MEMBERS THE PLANNING COMMISSION FEEL VERY STRETCHED AND -- AND THIS DOESN'T FEEL ENTIRELY FEASIBLE. YOU KNOW, GIVEN THAT PLANNING COMMISSION MEETS FOUR -- THREE TO FOUR TIMES A MONTH ALREADY, I THINK IT'S A LOT TO ASK OUR MEMBERS. AND I -- I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS AN ORDINANCE, AND SO I THINK THAT CENTER OF THE CITY WAS CREATED BY ORDINANCE, RIGHT, OR R SOLUTION, MR. LENART.
02:20:04.582: >> Planning Manager: RESOLUTION.
02:20:06.784: >> Councilmember Disch: IF THE DESIRE IS TO HAVE SOMEONE WITH PLANNING EXPERTISE, PERHAPS COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS WOULD SUIT THAT ROLE. IT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME WHAT THE INTENT IS ACTUALLY IN THE RESOLUTION.
02:20:22.199: >> Planning Manager:  YEAH, I DON'T KNOW EITHER. I WOULD PRESUME IT'S PROBABLY BOTH WAYS. IT'S, YOU KNOW, WHAT KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE FROM A PLANNING COMMISSION, WHAT -- IS THE COMMISSIONER SEEING AND REPORTING BACK. IT IS A GOOD QUESTION. YOU KNOW, AS A PUBLIC ASSET, AND I HAVE -- DEPENDING ON -- DEPENDING ON WHAT OCCURS, I MAY NOT HAVE A LOT OF INTERFACE WITH THE PLANNING COMMISSION, BUT, YEAH, THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT INTENTION WAS. COMMISSIONER L, THE Z.B.A. WILL B FULL NOW. SO THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A
02:21:09.013: >> Chair Mills: ONE MEETING A MONTH.
02:21:12.082: >>ommissioner e: MY PRERENCE IS MTER PLAN REVI, WHICH IS A REALLY EXCING TOPICOR ME. SO I THE Z.B.A. I FL, -- I USED TO WORK RIGHT ACROSS T REET FROM TT CENTER OF T CITY AND KNOWUST -- YOU THE TIME.K BY TT IGLOO ALL SOT'S NOT SOMETHING'M VERY PARTICULAR -- YOU KW, IF I GOTO SVE MY CITY, I WILL. BUT I THI THAT I CLD ADD MO SPECIFIC VALUE TO THE
02:21:49.720: >> Planninanager:  AND TRANSPORTION COMSSION.
02:21:54.324: >>ommissionerammerschmidt I'M T TRYG TO VOLUNTE, BUT MEETIN ARE NOT CENTER OF THE CITY THING.
02:22:01.298: >> Planning Manager:  SECOND THURSDAY OF THE MONTH, PROBABLY AT 6:00 OR 7:00.
02:22:07.805: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: OKAY. I MEAN, MY ISSUE IS JUST LIKE BEING OVER COMMITTED AND MY HUSBAND MIGHT, LIKE, LITERALLY KILL ME IF I DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS.
02:22:20.017: >> Chair Mills: I WAS ALSO -- IF I UNDERSTAND APPROPRIATELY, THE -- FROM THE OVERVIEW, THE MASTER PLAN REVIEW COMMITTEE IS PROBABLY NOT GOING TO BE VERY ACTIVE AND HISTORICALLY, HONESTLY HASN'T BEEN SO ACTIVE, EXCEPT WHEN WE WERE, LIKE -- I KNOW THAT THE COMMISSIONERS THAT WERE ON WERE VERY ACTIVE IN HELPING SELECT THE CONSULTANT OR VET THE CONSULTANTS, YES? SO I'M WONDERING, SHE'S NOT HERE. I WOULDN'T WANT TO PUT HER AS, LIKE -- LIKE, MAKE IT A DARK BLUE SQUARE, BUT I WONDER IF COMMISSIONER SAUVE, THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT SHE WOULD BE WILLING TO DO SINCE SHE IS ON ONE -- ONE OF HER ASSIGNMENTS IS TO THE MASTER PLAN REVIEW COMMITTEE, WHICH, AGAIN, WE DON'T EXPECT TO BE ACTIVE. THAT'S THE OTHER THING THAT I WOULD SAY, TO -- BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE COMMISSIONER LEE -- IT DOESN'T HURT TO HAVE PEOPLE IN THERE IN CASE THAT COMMITTEE DOES STAND UP, BUT -- I MEAN, SOMETIMES IT HASN'T MET ALL YEAR -- LIKE, IN THE ENTIRE YEAR.
02:23:30.354: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: WE NEVER MET SINCE I WAS ON PLANNING COMMISSION.
02:23:34.424: >> Planning Manager:  I WOULD LIKE TO START THAT COMMITTEE UP, BUT I HONESTLY THINK THAT -- I FEEL LIKE WE HAVE GOT A PRETTY GOOD CHUNK OF ORDINANCE WORK TO DO THAT I PROBABLY PRIORITIZE FIRST. I JUST -- BUT I DO FEEL STRONGLY. WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT IT. AT SOME POINT, WE WILL HAVE TO FIGURE OUT MASTER PLAN UPDATE. THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE WILL HAVE TO DO IT COMPREHENSIVELY, BUT I WOULD LOVE AT SOME POINT TO HAVE THAT COMMITTEE MEET AND JUST -- JUST START BRAINSTORMING YOU, YOU KNOW, WHAT SOME ARE CHUNKS OR PIECES, BUT I APPRECIATE YOUR POINT. I DON'T SEE THAT HAPPENING IMMEDIATELY. I LIKE PEOPLE CONFIRMING THAT THEY ARE INTERESTED IN THAT, SO THAT WHEN WE ARE READY TO DO IT, THEY ARE THERE BUT I THINK THERE'S PROBABLY A BIT OF A WINDOW BEFORE THAT. HMM.
02:24:27.911: >> Commissioner Lee: I THINK THAT'S AN INDIRECT WAY OF SAYING YOU SHOULD JOIN THE CENTER OF THE CITY.
02:24:34.885: >> Chair Mills: IS THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING COMMITTEE MEETING. I DON'T WANT TO PUT OUR FORM CHAIR ON THE SPOT, BUT IF THAT IS AN INACTIVE COMMITTEE TOO, THEN THERE SHOULD BE SOME BOX, PERHAPS. I'M AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY CALLER OUTER. COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN.
02:24:57.307: >> Commissioner Milshteyn: I WOULD LOVE TO SERVE ON THE SINGLE-FAMILY ZONING SUBCOMMITTEE, CONVERSATION.
02:25:08.218: >> Chair Mills: THANK YOU. THAT W WILL HELP TO FILL THAT OE OUT. YOU KNOW, AS COMMISSIONER DISCH SAID, LIKE, THE IDEA -- I DON'T WANT TO PUT -- I LIKE THE CREATIVE THINKING ON COMMISSIONER BRIGGS BUT I THINK IT WAS TWO-WAY, I DON'T WANT TO SIGN COMMISSIONER BRIGGS UP FOR ANOTHER COMMISSION THAT SHE JUST GOT OFF OF. THAT TIME IS REALLY HARD BECAUSE WE DO MEET AND ALSO, LIKE COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT, GETTING YOU KNOW, SIGNOFF.
02:25:49.960: >> Councilmember Disch: SHE WOULD JUST COME AND REPORT ONCE -- YOU KNOW, EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE.
02:26:00.304: >> Commissioner Clarke: IS IT OKAY?
02:26:03.040: >> Chair Mills: YES.
02:26:05.108: >> Commissioner Clarke: KNOWING AFFORDABLE HOUSING HAS NOT BEEN EXTRAORDINARILY ACTIVE, IT MAKES ME INTERESTED IN THE SINGLE FAMILY ZONING. I COULD SIGN.
02:26:17.888: >> Chair Mills: BUT NO TAKERS ON CENTER OF THE CITY.
02:26:22.259: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: IS IT ONGOING OR IS THERE LIKE -- LIKE, IS THERE A -- IS IT LIKE WE'RE GOING TO MEET FOREVER OR WE'RE GOING TO MEET FOR LIKE SIX MONTHS? IS THERE ANY --
02:26:33.337: >> Chair Mills: THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION. LET ME SE>> Planning Manager:  E SEE IF I CAN FIND OUT THAT ANSWER FOR YOU REAL QUICK.
02:26:47.117: >> Chair Mills: I THINK WE CAN ASK COMMI COMMISSIONER ABRONS AD COMMISSIONER SAUVE.
02:26:55.192: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: IN MY DAY JOB, I WORK A LOT OF ON PARKS AND OPEN SPACE. AND SO I'M NOT INTERESTED. I'M LITERALLY TRYING TO BALANCE MY LIFE.
02:27:05.869: >> Chair Mills: AMEN. COMMISSIONER DISCH.
02:27:11.575: >> Councilmember Disch: I THINK IT'S A REALLY EXCITING COMMITTEE. I THINK -- I THINK WHAT'S OFF PUTTING ABOUT IT IS IT'S A NEW VENTURE, AND IT'S A REALLY CREATIVE AND VISIONARY PROJECT, AND SO THERE IS SOME SORT OF FEELING OF, LIKE, OKAY, WHAT EXACTLY WOULD I BE GETTING MYSELF INTO AND IT'S DIFFERENT WHEN YOU ARE LOOKING AT STUFF THAT YOU KNOW IS ESTABLISHED AND YOU KNOW HOW THAT IT GOING TO WORK OUT. AND SO I THINK THAT'S -- I THINK THAT'S WHY PEOPLE ARE FEELING A LITTLE INTIMIDATED BY IT, BUT, YOU KNOW, IT WILL MAKE A WONDERFUL TRANSPORTATION OF THAT PART OF DOWNTOWN. SO, YOU KNOW, I THINK IT'S REALLY COOL. IT'S JUST I GET WHY PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY ON PLANNING, WHICH IS THE MOST DEMANDING COMMISSION THAT THERE IS, AND WE HAVE A HUGE SCHEDULE AND WE HAVE A HUGE AMOUNT OF WORK THAT WE PLAN TO DO BY JUNE. I GET THE CONCERN.
02:28:13.103: >> Planning Manager:  IT'S NOT CLEAR BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE STRUCTURED TO DELIVERED SOMETHING ABOUT I A TIME FRAME. -- A TIME FRAME AND BE DONE. I WOULD ENVISION THIS AS BEING AN ONGOING -- I THINK IT IS ABOUT AS TITLED, WHAT ARE THE NEXT STEPS TO START REALIZING SOME OF THE VISIONS FOR THAT PARK AND PLAZA AND OPEN SPACE. SO I THINK IT'S INTENDED TO BE AN ONGOING RESOURCE IN THAT REGARD. I DON'T THINK THAT MEANS IT'S RESPONSIBLE FOR DOING ALL OF THAT, BUT I THINK THE GOAL OF THIS IS TO TAKE THE VISION AND PROBABLY START PRIORITIZING, WHAT ARE THE NEXT STEPS THAT WE AS A COMMUNITY SHOULD DO IN ORDER TO MOVE FORWARD. SO MAYBE WHAT WE DO, FOR LACK OF A BETTER IDEA IS WE -- IF THE PLANNING COMMISSION WAS COMFORTABLE, WE WOULD DESIGNATE BOTH COMMISSIONERS ABRONS AND SAUVE FOR NOW. I WILL REACH OUT TO THEM. I WOULD ASK THAT THAT BE DONE IN AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT THAT IF EITHER ONE OF THEM IS INTERESTED IN THAT, THAT WOULD BE PUT FORWARD TO THE CITY COUNCIL WITH THE BLESSING OF THE PLANNING COMMISSION, AND -- AND THEN IF FOR SOME REASON THEY CAN'T BECAUSE OF CONFLICTS OR OTHER FACTORS IT WOULD HAVE TO RETURN FOR -- AT THAT POINT, I THINK WE WOULD EITHER WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN FORWARD SOMEBODY OR IF WE CONDITION, WE SHOULD PROBABLY COMMUNICATE TO THE COUNCIL THAT WE DON'T THINK THAT THE MAKEUP AS RECOMMENDED IS THE RIGHT MAKEUP AND WHY THAT IS. AS IT RELATES TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION, NOT WHOLLY.
02:29:58.074: >> Chair Mills: RIGHT. THAT SEEMS GREAT TO ME. IT ALLOWS US TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS. IT DOESN'T COMMIT EITHER ONE OF THEM, BUT IT GIVES US SOME OPTIONS.
02:30:16.259: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: DO WE KEEP THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND MASTER PLAN REVIEW LINES ON THERE IF THEY ARE NOT REALLY ACTIVE? THE BLUE BOX GETS FILLED BUT IT'S NOT REALLY HAPPENING, WHEREAS LIKE -- I HAVE BLUE BOXES FILLED THAT ARE HAPPENING EVERY MONTH AND I GO TO THESE MEETINGS, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING. I HAVE TO GO TO D.D.A. AND I HAVE TO GO TO ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION. I HAVE THESE MEETINGS.
02:30:39.349: >> Planning Manager:  NOBODY WANTS TO HEAR YOU COMPLAIN.
02:30:43.286: >> Chair Mills: I WAS GOING TO CIRCLE BACK AND SAY, DO YOU -- LIKE, ARE YOU OKAY? WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO IS ALREADY MARKED.
02:30:52.229: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: I'M FIND BEING ON WHAT I'M ON AND IT'S LIKE A KNOWN ENTITY, KIND OF LIKE -- I THINK THAT'S PART OF IT, BUT I ALSO THINK IF YOU ARE ON ONE OF THE ONES THAT ISN'T REALLY MEETING, THEN THAT'S JUST PART OF WHAT WE'RE WEIGHING HERE TOO, YOU KNOW?
02:31:09.246: >> Planning Manager:  I WOULD -- I THINK IT'S A GOOD QUESTION. IT'S A GOOD QUESTION. I WOULD LOOK AT THEM A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY. I ACTUALLY PROBABLY SEE MORE WORK IN THE FUTURE FROM MASTER PLAN REVIEW COMMITTEE THAN THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING COMMITTEE AND I THINK ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THAT IS THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING COMMITTEE WAS REALLY -- IT WAS A BRAINSTORMING FUNCTION OF THOSE TWO GROUPS AND THEY TALKED ABOUT WAYS THAT WE COULD MAKE LAND USE POLICY POTENTIALLY TO ADVANCE OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING GOALS AND KOWALSKI WANT -- AND I DON'T WANT TO SAY THAT WE CAN'T ALWAYS ADVANCE THAT FURTHER BUT I -- I VALUE THE WAY THE PLANNING COMMISSION AND THE CITY HAVE DONE IN THIS REGARD ALREADY.
02:31:50.854: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: RIGHT.
02:31:52.489: >> Planning Manager:  WE TALKED ABOUT PREMIUMS. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT TRANSIT ZONING AND THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS THIS EVENING MAKE AFFORDABLE HOUSING -- IT'S NOT -- IT'S NOT TO SAY THAT I DON'T VALUE THAT RELATIONSHIP, BUT ON THE FLIP SIDE, I -- I FEEL THAT YOU AS A BOARD PRETTY STRONGLY INTERNALIZE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE WORK THAT YOU DO AS IT IS. IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THAT PUSH. SO MY INITIAL RESPONSE TO THAT IS IF YOU WANTED TO SORT OF NARROW THE BANDS OF -- OF ASSIGNMENTS, I MIGHT START THERE, BEFORE I WOULD REMOVE THE MASTER PLAN COMMITTEE.
02:32:32.262: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: MM-HMM.
02:32:37.534: >> Chair Mills: COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT.
02:32:38.735: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: I WANTED TO POINT OUT THIS MAY BE A COINCIDENCE, THAT BOTH COMMISSIONER SAUVE AND COMMISSIONER ABRONS ARE NOT HERE AND WE ARE MEETING ON A THURSDAY NIGHT AND I DON'T KNOW IF THAT MEANS THEY CAN'T MEET ON CENTER OF THE CITY COMMITTEE. I WOULD SAY IF WE COULD CHECK WITH THEM AND NEITHER ONE OF THEM CAN DO IT AND CAN'T DO IT AND  YOU CAN GET A LITTLE MORE CLARITY ON TIME BECAUSE 7:00 IS EASIER FOR ME THAN 6:00, I COULD BE THAT THIRD.
02:33:14.504: >> Planning Manager:  ALL RIGHT. Commissioner mmerschmidt: CHOICE, WHATEVER.
02:33:18.441: >> Chair Mil: THANKOU, COMMISONER HAMMERSCHMIDT.
02:33:23.913: >> Planng Manager:  I APPRECIATE TT. I THINK YOU BACKGUND AND YR RK IS AUALLY QUITE APPLICAB TO THAT --
02:33:32.055: >> Commissione Hammerschmi: I FUY AGREE. THIS IS A REA SUGGLE F ME CAUSE I REALLY DON'T WANT TO RO OFF.R.C. I HAVE BEEN ONT F SO MANY MONTHS. AH.
02:33:40.830: >> Plaing Manager I HAN'T REMOVEDOU FROM THAT, BYHE WAY
02:33:44.234: >> Comssioner Hammschmidt:
02:33:44.901: >> Chairills: ALL OFHE N VE TO ARM WRESTLE MEORUOULD
02:33:57.013: >> Commissior Hammerschdt: COMMTEEF IENT ON CENTER OF THE CITY.
02:34:03.787: >> Planning Manager:  OKAY. AFFORDABLE HOUSING COMMITTEE, LEAVE IT AS IT IS FOR NOW. I HAVE COMMISSIONERS ABRONS, CLARKE, AND MILSHTEYN. THE MASTER PLAN REVIEW COMMITTEE, LEAVE IT FOR NOW, I HAVE COMMISSIONERS CLARKE, HAMMERSCHMIDT, LEE, AND SAUVE. ORDINANCE REVISIONS COMMITTEE REMAINS AS IT IS, COMMISSIONERS ABRONS, HAMMERSCHMIDT, MILLS AND SAUVE. EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE IS BY OFFICERS. I WILL SKIP SINGLE FAMILY ZONING AND COMMUNITY CONVERSATIONS FOR NOW. CENTER OF THE CITY INITIATING COMMITTEE WILL BE WITH THE FULL SUPPORT OF THE PLANNING COMMISSION COMMISSIONER SAUVE OR ABRONS AND IF UNAVAILABLE COMMICOMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT. THE DOWNTOWN DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY AFFORDABILITY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE WILL BE MAINTAINED AS COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL. ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION, COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL. THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION COMMISSIONER LEE. AND I'M GOING TO PUT FORTH COMMISSIONER LEE POTENTIALLY AS THE ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS SHOULD A SPOT OPEN IN THE FUTURE. FRANKLY, YOU WOULD HAVE SORT OF ANOTHER CRACK AT THAT BECAUSE YOU WOULD HAVE TO ACTUALLY APPLY TO THAT TO THE MAYOR FOR APPOINTMENT BUT THIS IS A PLANNING COMMISSION, WE ARE NOT GOING TO FIGHT YOU FOR THAT. THAT SOUND CONSISTENT? ALL RIGHT. SO NOW LET'S GO TO COMMUNITY CONVERSATIONS SINGLE-FAMILY ZONING. SO I'VE GOT COMMISSIONERS CLARKE, DISCH, AND MILSHTEYN EXPRESSING INTEREST IN THAT SO FAR. SO THIS IS A -- I THINK THIS IS A BIG, BIG OPPORTUNITY. IT'S ON OUR WORK PLAN. CONVERSATIONS ARE HAPPENING LOCALLY AS OF THE LAST WORKING SESSION. CONVERSATIONS ARE HAPPENING OVER A TUMULTUOUS YEAR OF OUR COUNTRY. AND THE PLANNING COMMISSION IS INTERESTED IN EXPLORING HOW RACIAL INEQUITIES, ZONING -- HOW -- WHAT WE -- WHAT IS THERE TO LEARN HAD? HOW ARE THESE THINGS INTERRELATED. HOW DOES EQUITY RELATE TO THESE THINGS? AND MY SENSE IS THAT THE PLANNING COMMISSION IS REALLY INTERESTED IN EXPLORING THIS, NOT BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT YOU HAVE POLICY STEPS TO TAKE, BUT YOU WANT TO UNDERSTAND THIS WORLD FOR FUTURE USE SO AT A MINIMUM, WE ARE NOT PERPETUATING THOSE NEGATIVE ASPECTS AND IDEALLY DOWN THE LINE, MIGHT LEAD TO FUTURE POLICY DISCUSSIONS. BUT REALLY, EARNESTLY, APPROACHING IT AS AN EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY AT THE OUTSET. AND SO WHEN WE ADDED THAT TO OUR WORK PLAN, WE ALSO RECOGNIZED THAT MEANS THERE'S PROBABLY A LONG-TERM THE OF PROSPECTIVES THAT ARE NOT HERE THAT WOULD BE VALUABLE FOR US TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT COMMUNITY CONVERSATION LOOKS LIKE, AND THE ASPECTS OF IT. AND SO, AGAIN, I DON'T KNOW THAT WE'LL HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS HERE BUT I WOULD LOVE TO JUST AT LEAST TAKE A FEW MOMENTS TO HEAR WHAT YOUR IDEAS ARE. MAYBE THERE'S OTHER BOARDS OR COMMISSIONS THAT YOU THINK WOULD BE VALUABLE TO CONNECT WITH, TO PARTNER WITH. WHAT ARE YOUR -- DO YOU HAVE ANY PRELIMINARY THOUGHTS ON HOW THIS MIGHT LOOK?
02:37:59.122: >> Chair Mills: COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN?
02:38:01.624: >> Commissioner Milshteyn: MY FIRST INITIAL THOUGHT WAS TO SEE IF PR PROFESSOR STIENBERG OR GOODSPEED WOULD BE WILLING TO SERVE ON THIS. I THINK WITH THE WORK THAT THEY ARE DOING, I THINK WOULD BE GREAT TO GET THEIR PERSPECTIVE ON IT. THE OTHER -- THE OTHER SORT OF AREAS THAT I THINK WE SHOULD COVER IS MAYBE GETTING SOME REPRESENTATION FROM LIKE THE BRYANT COMMUNITY CENTER, FROM THE ANN ARBOR COMMUNITY CENTER ON MAIN -- IS IT THE ANN ARBOR COMMUNITY CENTER? IS THAT THE NAME OF THAT ORGANIZATION? BUT, LIKE, LOOKING AT SOME OF THE COMMUNITY CENTERS THAT ARE IN TOWN AND GETTING SOME REPRESENTATION FROM THEM. I THINK THAT WOULD BE SUPER HELPFUL JUST TO GET THEIR PERSPECTIVE INTO THINGS.
02:38:55.011: >> Chair Mills: COMMISSIONER CLARKE.
02:38:57.513: >> Commissioner Clarke: I HAVE BEEN READING UP A LOT ABOUT THIS WORK THAT THEY HAVE BEEN DOING, ESPECIALLY IN BOSTON AND MINNEAPOLIS AND BOSTON AREA. AND IT'S BEEN QUITE INTERESTING JUST READING ABOUT THE WAY THAT THEY IS KIND OF FORMULATED THE PROCESS AND I THINK ANN ARBOR COULD, MAYBE PARTNER WITH ORGANIZATIONS LIKE COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN SAID, AS WELL AS THERE'S A LOT OF ROOM FOR, LIKE, BRINGING FORTH, I GUESS, PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT SURROUNDING THIS. AND, YEAH, JUST MAKE SURE THAT COMMUNICATIONS ARE OUT IN THE OPEN. AND MAYBE I CAN SEND SOMETHING TO THE GROUP ABOUT THE BEST PRACTICES THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN PUT TOGETHER AND -- YEAH.
02:39:39.756: >> Planning Manager:  YEAH, WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE WEBSITE AND THE WORKING SESSION AND SOME OTHER RESOURCES. I WOULD GENERALLY SAY IF YOU -- THAT IF THERE ARE OTHER RESOURCES THAT YOU WOULD THINK ARE OF BENEFIT TO YOUR COLLEAGUES, TO THE COMMUNITY, LET US KNOW. YOU KNOW, WE CAN FIGURE OUT, YOU KNOW, WHICH OF THOSE MAY MAKE SENSE TO PROMOTE AND LINK AND HELP -- HELP AT LEAST START ESTABLISHING A TRAIL FOR FOLKS TO DO SIMILAR EXPLORATION LIKE YOU ARE DOING.
02:40:17.160: >> Chair Mills: COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN AND THEN COMMISSIONER DISCH.
02:40:20.229: >> Commissioner Milshteyn: I'M ACTUALLY GOOD. THANK YOU.
02:40:23.733: >> Councilmember Disch: I THINK THERE ARE A LOT -- THERE'S A LOT OF COMMUNITY EXPERTISE AROUND THIS, AND SO I WOULD NOT NECESSARILY WANT ALL OF THEM TO BE ON THE COMMITTEE BUT I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A MEETING WHERE WE PICKED THE BRAINS OF JESS LETAH AND SHE MAY HAVE NAMES FOR PEOPLE WHO COULD COME SPEAK. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE -- I THINK WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THE FORMAT OF SORT OF THE PUBLIC FORUMS THAT WE MIGHT HAVE WOULD BE. AND I THINK THAT IN CONTRAST TO THE -- THE JOB THAT O.S.I. DID AROUND THE A2ZERO PLAN, WHERE THEY REALLY -- THEY KNEW WHERE THEY WERE GOING AND THERE'S SCIENCE THAT TELLS THEM HOW NO DO IT AND SO IT WAS VERY MUCH EDUCATIVE, I THINK THIS IS REALLY CONVERSATIONAL. THIS IS ABOUT AIRING THE SIDES OF DEBATE BECAUSE THERE ARE LOTS OF SIDES TO THIS DEBATE. I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE REPRESENT, THAT -- WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT HOLD PEOPLE BACK FROM THE KINDS OF CHANGE THAT WE WANT TO SEE IN PLACES LIKE MINNEAPOLIS. IT IS NOT TO I IS ACCEPT THE COURSE OF ACTION, LIKE THE A2ZERO, AND RIGHTFULLY SO, BUT IT IS A CHANCE FOR THIS COMMUNITY TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THIS ENVISIONS, WHAT IT FEARS, WHAT IT WANTS, AND YEAH, THAT'S MY VISION FOR THIS AND I'M OBVIOUSLY -- I'M ALWAYS OPEN TO BEING CORRECTED, UN -- YOU KNOW PERSUADED OUT OF MY PLACE, WHATEVER.
02:42:25.388: >> Commissioner Lee: I KNOW WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE COMMUNITY CONVERSATION, AND WHAT THAT WILL LOOK LIKE. THERE ARE TWO COMMENTS, AS FAR AS MY ACTUAL, LIKE VOLUNTEERS FOR THE Z.B Z.B.A. THINK. I THINK PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SAY YOU HAVE A LOT OF CONFLICTS. THEY SAID I HAD CONFLICTS FOR HERE. I JUST HAVE SOME CONCERNS, YOU KNOW, AGAIN, I WILL STILL STICK WITH MASTER PLAN REVIEW AND TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION, BUT, I MEAN, IF PEOPLE WANT ME TO SERVE ON IT, I CERTAINLY WILL, BUT I JUST WANTED TO KIND OF VOICE THAT AS YOU MAY SEE OPPOSITION FROM THAT STANDPOINT. AND 30 SECONDS. I HAVE COMMUNITY EFFICACY, AND HIGH-RISES. I GREW UP IN HIGH-RISES IN KOREA. ARE PEOPLE MORE LIKELY TO SHARE SUGAR IN HIGH-RISES OR A SINGLE-FAMILY. THERE'S MORE NEGATIVE IN HIGH-RISES. PEOPLE ONLY INTERACT AT MAILBOXES AND ELEVATOR SHAFTS WHEN IT'S 30 STORIES OR HIGHER. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT IN PEOPLE'S LAWNS. PEOPLE TALK ON LAWNS AND PORCHES AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE. IT WAS AN INTERESTING PAPER BECAUSE IT WAS SPURRED BY THIS HIGH-RISE RELATIVE TO COMMUNITY EFFICACY AND I REALIZED I NEVER KNEW ANY OF THE NEIGHBORS. I KNEW THE ONES THAT WERE ON THE SAME FLOOR THAT WERE LIKE RIGHT ACROSS. AND MAYBE THE FLOOR ABOVE AND BELOW. BUT WHEN I MOVED TO AMERICA, I WAS LIKE, WHY DO SO MANY PEOPLE KNOW EACH OTHER? IT'S GOOD PUBLIC SPACE. SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT DUPLEXES, QUAD PLEXES, MORE OF DENSITY, PROVIDING SUCCESSFUL PUBLIC SPACES IS CRITICAL TO MAINTAIN THE COMMUNITY EFFICACY. SO THE IDEA CAN I BORROW A CUP OF SUGAR FROM SOMEBODY ELSE. I WAS LIKE, YOU KNOW WHAT THAT PAPER WAS REALLY RELEVANT TO THIS DISCUSSION OF CREATING DENSITY BECAUSE HIGH-RISES ARE THE ULTIMATE DENSITY. YOU KNOW, C KOREA IS DEMOLISHING 30-STORY FOR 50 STORIES. TOTALLY COMPLETELY OFF -- YOU KNOW SORRY ABOUT THAT. ZBA, I COULD SEE HOW PEOPLE MIGHT BE CONCERNED BUT I THINK I HAVE OBJECTIVELY VALUE TO HAVE. I THINK THE SINGLE FAMILYONING HAS A LOT OF GREAT DISSSIONS TO BE HAD. I AGREEITH PARTNERING WITH THOSE TY OF COMMUTIES BUT THEN I WANTED TO INJECT THAT. I WOULD BE HAPPY TO SEND YOU THE PAPER I WROTE ALSO. IT'S REALLY LG. NOT THATOOD, SORRY. COME UP WITH Z.B.A.S HAND
02:45:37.813: >> Comssioner Milshtn: YES, EIGHT YEARSF HISTO ON Z.B.A. SO COMMISSNER LEE TRE'S NO NFLICT. E MAJORITOF THE WORKS RESIDENTIAL. AND AITTLE BIT OF SIGNS, YOU KNOW, LIKET CMERCIAL PLACE AITTLEIT OF THAT, SO ION'T SE HOW YOUOULD BE CONFLTED OUT OF TOO MANOF THE ITE. IT'S -- YEA IT MOSTLY RESIDENTIAL WORK.
02:46:03.339: >> Comssioner Lee:KAY. IESCIND MY COMMENT. THANYOUOR THE CLARIFITION Cha Mls: COMMISSION HAMMERSCHMID
02:46:12.114: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: OH, NOW I FORGET WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY. WAS IT LAST TIME, OUR LAST WORKING SESSION, H.R.C. MEMBERS, I THINK ATTENDED AND THEY MIGHT BE A GROUP THAT MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN HAVING A DESIGNEE OR TWO ON THIS COMMITTEE. ANOTHER THING I WANT TO THROW OUT THERE, I DON'T THINK IF THERE'S ANY BUDGET FOR THIS, BUT I THINK WE NEED TO START THINKING ABOUT ESPECIALLY AS WE GO OUT TO THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS, TO GET THEIR INPUT, ESPECIALLY AS IT RELATES TO EQUITY. I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT COMPENSATION FOR THAT EXPERTISE. AND IT MAY BE WORTH CONSIDERING, LIKE, DO WE NEED TO HIRE SOME SORT OF HIRE -- GET THOUGHTS FROM LIKE A RACIAL EQUITY ADVISOR. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH SOME. I HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH ONE AT WORK AND IT'S BEEN REALLY HELPFUL AND, LIKE -- I DON'T KNOW, LIKE HAVING SOUNDING BOARDS FOR THESE CONVERSATIONS. LIKE AS WE ARE FORMING THIS GROUP, I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE NOT UNINTENTIONALLY TONE DEAF. THIS IS A REALLY SENSITIVE CONVERSATION AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE STRUCTURING IT CORRECTLY AND THINKING ABOUT ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO APPROACH IT.
02:47:23.319: >> Chair Mills: THANK YOU FOR BRINGING UP H.R.C., BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THEY WOULD BE INTERESTED IN HAVING A COUPLE MEMBERS, IF WE'RE INTERESTED. THEY ARE ALREADY -- I MEAN THIS IN MY MIND IS KIND OF THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING COMMITTEE, YOU KNOW, IT DOESN'T MEET MUCH ANY MORE. MAYBE IT COULD BE A MODEL OF THAT, WHERE THERE'S MEMBERS FROM EACH. BUT I KIND OF WHAT TO GO BACK TO WHAT THE NAME IS AND WHAT THE PURPOSE IS BECAUSE I THINK THAT I'M HEARING DIFFERENT THINGS. AND ALSO I THINK THAT THE NAME IS GOING TO SEND A HUGE -- LIKE, IT'S -- YOU KNOW, THOSE TWINNINGS ARE INTERTWINED. SO -- THOSE TWO THINGS ARE INTERTWINED. THE TWO THINGS I'M HEARING, ONE IS VERY MUCH FUTURE ORIENT. LET'S GET INPUT AND FEEL WHAT PEOPLE WANT AND NEED. ANOTHER ONE IS LET'S EDUCATE OURSELVES ON HOW WE GOT TO OUR PLACE AND THE INEQUITIES IN ZONING. AND IT'S -- AND IN MY MIND, LIKE TO SOME EXTENT, THE CONCERN OVER, LIKE, THE ACTUAL, LIKE, SINGLE-FAMILY ZONING IS THAT IT NAMES A PARTICULAR PLACE. IT KIND OF PREPOSES WHAT WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING AND I DON'T NECESSARILY KNOW THAT THAT WAS MY -- THAT THAT WAS THE INTENTION BEHIND IT. I THINK IT'S -- YOU KNOW, THE NUMBER -- THE WORDS THAT I HAD WRITTEN DOWN ON MY -- ON MY BOOK WERE INEQUITY IN ZONING OR SOMETHING OF THAT MIND. IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE SPECIFIC THAN COMMUNITY CONVERSATION, BUT THE IDEA OF A COMMUNITY CONVERSATION IS HELPFUL. AT LEAST THE INITIAL STAGES, I WOULD I IMAGINE THAT THIS IS LET'S GET GOOD INFORMATION. LET'S TAKE WHAT COMMISSIONER CLARKE FOUND. AND SOME PLACES MAY BE MORE ACTION ORIENTED BUT THERE'S A LOT OF RESEARCH COMING OUT OF BOSTON AND OTHER PLACES ABOUT -- LIKE, JUST UNDERSTANDING HOW THE PAST PERPETUATES INEQUITIES NOW. AND WE NEED TO EDUCATE OURSELVES TO THAT. IN MY MIND, THIS IS HELPING FORMULATE WHAT WE AS PLANNING COMMISSIONERS TO BE RESPONSIBLE COMMISSIONERS NEED TO KNOW TO DO OUR JOB, LIKE WE WANT TO LEARN ABOUT HEAT PUMPS, RIGHT? BUT ALSO, ALONG THE SAME LINES LIKE MAKING THAT AVAILABLE TO THE COMMUNITY. BUT -- AND I THINK THAT IT MAY LEAD TO ACTION, BUT I HONESTLY THINK THAT MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE ALL WORKING FROM THE SAME FACTS HISTORICAL FACTS AND THE LINKS BETWEEN THAT MIGHT HELP INITIALLY. AND SO IT WOULDN'T BE SO MUCH LIKE, I -- I THINK THAT WHERE YOU WERE GOING, COMMISSIONER COR COMMISSIONERHAMMERSCHMIDT, LIKES INVOLVED AND COMPENSATION FOR THEM MAKES A WHOLE LOT OF SENSE, PARTICULARLY AS WE THINK ABOUT CHANGES AND SOLUTIONS AND KIND OF THERE WAS A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT. SOME OF -- I MEAN, SOME OF THAT MAY BE APPROPRIATE IN THE EDUCATIONAL PART, BUT I THINK -- BUT MAYBE NOT. OR I DON'T KNOW. I WOULD JUST BRING UP I'M HEARING FROM DIFFERENT PEOPLE, I'M HEARING A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT THINGS. MAYBE THE FIRST JOB IS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IT IS BUT BEFORE WE ASK OTHER PEOPLE TO BE ON, IT WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE FORMULATED. I'M HAPPY TO BE ON IT BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING I WANT TO LEARN ABOUT MYSELF, IF IT COULD NOT BE BETWEEN -- AFTER WORK, IF IT COULD BE EARLY OR OR IN THE AFTERNOON. ANYWAY. BUT THAT'S -- YEAH. OR I CAN JUST JOIN WHEN I CAN. COMMISSIONER CLARKE.
02:50:55.364: >> Commissioner Clarke: I WAS GOING TO SEE THE WORK IN SOME OTHER CITIES REFERRED TO USING THINGS LIKE EXAMINING LOCAL LAND USE WITH THE FAIR HOUSING LENS OR WITH AN INCLUSIVE LAND USE OR EQUITABLE DEVELOPMENT, HISTORY AND FURTHER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. I THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO ME TO BROADEN IT BECAUSE WITH ZONING THERE'S SO MANY PROBLEMS THAT KIND OF -- MOVING PARTS THAT WE SHOULDN'T REALLY START WITH WHAT, Y YOU KNOW -- YOU KNOW, START WITH ANY ASSUMPTIONS.
02:51:27.596: >> Chair Mills: COMMISSIONER DISCH?
02:51:29.131: >> Councilmember Disch: YES, WE WERE ACTUALLY HAVING A CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS EARLIER THIS AFTERNOON, AND I WAS THINKING ABOUT A BROADER FRAMING JUST LIKE EQUITY AND SUSTAINABILITY, THAT IT'S A COMMUNITY CONVERSATION AROUND EQUITY AMENITY SUSTAINABILITY BUT THROUGH THE LENS THAT PLANNING COMMISSION GOES AT IT. BUT I THINK THAT -- I DO NOT THINK THAT WE WANT TO CALL THIS SINGLE FAMILY ZONING BECAUSE I THINK IT'S JUST AN INVITATION TO GET A LOT OF REALLY ANGRY PEOPLE. I MEAN, JUST BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH FEAR AROUND SINGLE-FAMILY ZONING. AND I MEAN NO REFLECTION ON ANYONE ABOUT THIS, IT'S A HOT BUTTON TOPIC BUT I THINK WE WANT TO HAVE A BROADER CONVERSATION AROUND THE VALUES THAT WE HAVE IN COMMON. WE HAVE VALUES OF SUSTAINABILITY AND EQUITY AND IT WILL LEAD US INTO DISCUSSIONS OF SINGLE-FAMILY ZONING FOR SURE, BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S THE FRAME THAT WE WANT FOR THIS. AND I THINK WORDS LIKE "LAND USE USE." WE WANT IT TO BE A CONVERSATION BEYOND PEOPLE ON THIS. LAND USE, IT'S JUST NOT A WORD FOR MOST PEOPLE. AND SO I THINK WITH THE VET -- STARTING WITH THE VALUES AND THEN THINKING ABOUT HOW OUR BUILT ENVIRONMENT AND HOW OUR SPACES ABSORB VALUES THAT WE NO LONGER BELIEVE IN, RIGHT? THAT'S THE BIG OBSERVATION THAT WE WANT TO HAVE, THAT LOTS OF PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN. LOOK AT ALL THE PEOPLE WHO CAME TO THE DISCUSSION OF RACIAL COVENANTS. AND THIS IS SO MUCH IN THE AIR AND LOTS OF PEOPLE WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT. I THINK THAT THE MORE WE CAN FRAME IT AS AN EXPLORATORY CONVERSATION, RAPTOR THAN FOCUSING ON -- RATHER THAN FOCUSING ON ANYTHING THAT WE ARE ABOUT TO DO, I THINK THE BETTER OFF WE ARE. AND THE MORE SORT OF GOOD IN-FAITH CONVERSATIONS WE CAN HAVE. I WOULD CHANGE THE NAME A BIT, AND YEAH.
02:53:43.966: >> Chair Mills: I REMUTED MYSELF. COMMISSIONER CLARKE, DID YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO ADD TO THAT. YOUR HAND IS STILL UP.
02:53:52.507: >> Commissioner Clarke: SORRY.
02:53:53.141: >> Chair Mills: GO ■AHEAD.
02:54:00.916: >> Commissioner Clarke: I WAS TRYING TO TAKE IT DOWN.
02:54:03.151: >> Chair Mills: PROFESSOR GOODSPEED FOLLOWED UP WITH ME AFTER THE PRESENTATION LAST WEEK, JUST TO SAY, HEY, HERE'S WHAT'S GOING ON. WE WERE TALKING ABOUT GETTING STUDENTS TO LOOK AT THIS STUFF AND SHARED WITH ME A PAPER THAT CAME OUT AND WILL BE WHAT CITY IT'S -- I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT CITY, IT'S IN CALIFORNIA. IT'S THE GEOGRAPHY OF INEQUALITY AND HOW LAND USE PRODUCES SEGREGATION. THE IMPORTANT THING IS IT'S ALL OF LAND USE REGULATION. LIKE, IT'S NOT JUST LIKE IT IT ONLY MULTIFAMILY VERSUS SINGLE FAMILY. IT'S ALL OF THE THINGS. AND THIS IS WHERE ALL OF OUR CONVERSATIONS ARE CONNECTED. AWFUL OF THE THINGS THAT WE DO THAT MAKE THINGS MORE EXPENSIVE PRICE OUT SOME PEOPLE, THE PEOPLE THAT MAY NOT HAVE CAPITAL, RIGHT, AND THE RENT THEY DON'T HAVE CAPITAL IS -- AND THE REASON THAT THEY DON'T HAVE CAPITAL IS BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE HISTORICAL CAPITAL. IT'S NOT JUST HOW MANY UNITS YOU CAN BUILD ON A PARTICULAR LOT. IT'S ALL OF THE OTHER THINGS. THAT'S WHY I THINK HAVING A DISCUSSION THAT'S I DON'T KNOW LIKE TAKING THE -- BEYOND THE SPECIFIC ZONES AND TALKING ABOUT INEQUALITY IN ZONING OR INEQUALITY IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS, LIKE HOWEVER WE WANT TO CALL IT. I THINK SOME OF THAT IS PULLING TOGETHER WHAT H HAD AS BEEN DONE OTHER PLACES AND USING HOW ARE THEY MEASURING HOW UNEQUALITY, YOU KNOW MY IDEAS ARE. HOW UNEQUAL THESE PLACES UNDER CALIFORNIA. LIKE, LET'S RUN OUR ZONING ORDINANCE THROUGH THAT TEST, JUST TO GET -- SO I WOULD CONCUR WITH THAT. TO HAVE THE CONVERSATION AND MAKE IT MORE EDUCATIONAL AND INCLUSIVE. MR. LENART, YOU HAVE BEEN MAKING LOTS OF FACES AS I HAVE BEEN TALKING.
02:56:01.803: >> Planning Manager:  THAT'S WHAT I DO.
02:56:04.206: >> Chair Mills: I THINK THIS IS STILL TRUE TO WHAT OUR WORK PLAN SAYS.
02:56:13.115: >> Planning Manager:  NO, AS I PREFACED, I DON'T KNOW THAT WE WILL SOLVE IT. I'M TRYING TO THINK OF WHERE WILL WE GO. ONE OF THE THINGS I'M THINKING ABOUT IS I'M RELUCTANT TO CALL IT A PROJECT SCOPE BUT MAYBE THE NEXT STEP IS TO STAY THE DISCUSSION THAT WE HAD HERE AND THE IDEA GENERATION ABOUT WHO. START ADDING SOME OF IT TO WHAT IS HAPPENING PERHAPS IN SE OTHER COMMUNITIES AS MODELS. AND THEN SO FEEL LIKE I CAN PRESENT IT BACK TO YOU IN A FULLY FORMED THIS IS WHAT WE SHOULD DO, BUT I FEEL LIKE I COULD PULL SOME OF THIS TOGETHER AND PACKAGE IT TO OUR NEXT CHAPTER OF THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT OKAY, NOW THIS IS HOW SOME OTHER COMMUNITIES ARE APPROACHING IT AND THIS IS HOW THEY ARE SIMILAR TO WHAT WE ARE VISIONING HERE AND HOW THE MIGHT BE DIFFERENT. I GUESS MY INSTINCT IS TO TAKE Y OTHER INPUT THAT YOU HAVE ON AGAIN, NOT SOLVE IT, BUT START TO ORGANIZE IT A LITTLE BIT AND WORKING SESSIO DENDING HOWOR THEGENDAS LOOK, FOR THE NEXT EATION OF IT. THAT --T THAT SEEM LIKE AN PROACH?
02:57:52.547: >> Chair Mls: MY QUESTIO IS WOD YOU BRINGT BACKS A COMMTEE -- WE DON KNOWHATNG A BUT PEOPLE KNOW THAT THEY ARE NERALLY IERESTED, WOULDOU SUBCOMMITT?T BACK T THAT
02:58:02.524: >> Pnng Manager  THAT'S A I -- I ORIGINAY ENVISNS THAT ATEVER THAT LINE WAS WAS GNG TO BE THEARGER GUP BUT THAT COULD WORK THAT GROUPO MAYBE FINDTITTLE BIT FURTHER THAN WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. I'M OPEN TO HOW THE COMMISSION WOULD LIKE TO APPROACH THAT.
02:58:26.715: >> Chair Mills: COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT.
02:58:28.016: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: I'M DEFINITELIED IN THIS TOPIC, VERY MUCH SO. I MEAN, IT COULD GO TWOS MAYBE. IT SEEMS LIKE THE WAY COMMISSIONER MILLS FRAMED IT TO OUR WORK PLAN, LIKE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK THE ENTIRE COMMISSION BENEFITS FROM AND IS INVOLVED IN, AND IF THERE IS A SMALLER SUBCOMMITTEE, MAYBE THAT'S MORE LIKE THE DETAILS OF HOW THIS GETS COMMUNICATED AND OUTREACH FOR PEOPLE TO COME IN AND TALK TO US BUT I PERSONALLY WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE IF A LOT OF THIS EDUCATION WAS BROUGHT BACK TO US AS A MULL COMMISSION AND WORKING SESSIONS, ET CETERA.
02:59:10.792: >> Chair Mills: TOTALLY AGREE. I THINK THE SUBCOMMITTEE HELPS OUTREACH PLAN SO THAT MR. LENART HAHAS SOMEBODY TO BOUNCE IDEAS F OF. WHO SHOULD WE BRING IN NEXT TO TALK TO US?
02:59:27.742: >> Planning Manager:  IS THAT LIKE I'M INTERESTED IN THAT GROUP.
02:59:32.514: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: IS THAT EXTRA MEETINGS? IS THAT IT 7:00 AT NIGHT?
02:59:36.384: >> Planning Manager:  WE HAVEN'T SCHEDULED IT.
02:59:38.954: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: ADD ME. ADD ME FOR NOW. [ LAUGHTER ]
02:59:45.160: >> Chair Mills: COMMISSIONER CLARK.
02:59:56.638: >> Commissioner Clarke: I WANTED TO CLARIFY HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE ON IT. WAS I ON IT?

03:02:25.720: >> Planning Manager: MR. STULBERG, YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
03:02:29.591: >> THANK YOU. INTERESTING DISCUSSION ON THAT LAST ITEM. I WILL MAKE A COMMENT ON THAT. BE CAREFUL. THERE'S -- THERE'S DEFINITELY A GROUP OF PEOPLE IN TOWN WHO WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE ELIMINATION OF SINGLE-FAMILY ZONING. AND A GROUP OF PEOPLE IN TOWN WHO FEAR THAT THAT FIRST GROUP HAS A LOT OF INFLUENCE AND IS ABOUT TO DO THAT. SO EITHER WAY YOU GO YOU SHALL RUNNING INTO A LOT OF EMOTIONS, AT LEAST IMAGINED CONTROVERSY BEFORE YOU EVEN GET STARTED. SO GOOD LUCK TO YOU WITH THAT! BUT I DEVELOP SINGLE FAMILY HOUSING FOR LIVING FOR A WHILE AND TRANSITIONS INTO RENOVATING OLDER HOMES. A LOT OF THEM DUPLEXED. THE FIRST HOME I BOUGHT IN 1994, WHEN I MOVED BACK TO ANN ARBOR WAS A TRACK PLACE. AND I WORKED WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE TO DO -- BECAUSE I ALSO -- I'M ALSO REALTOR TO GET PEOPLE INTO AN EQUITY BUILDING SITUATION AND IT REALLY HELPED TO MAKE UP FOR LESSER INCOMES. I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S A POLITE WAY TO SAY THAT. I LOVE OWNER OCCUPIED DUPLEXES TO GET PEOPLE INTO AN EQUITY-BUILDING SITUATION AND THAT WOULD INCLUDE THE MINORITIES WHO WERE EXCLUDED. I THROW THAT OUT AS A WAY TO DO THINGS. WE HAD A CONDO CONVERSION PROJECT AND WE AIMED IT AT FIRST TIME BUYERS AT A LOWER PRICE POINT AND IT WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL FOR THE FIRST TWO-THIRDS AND THEN WE RAN INTO THE GREAT RECESSION. SO IT DIDN'T ECONOMICALLY WORK OUT WELL FOR US. BUT I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO EXPLORE THAT IDEA DO. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO THAT PUBLICLY, BUT I REALLY THINK THE KEY FOCUS ON HISTORIC, SYSTEMIC, WHAT RACISM IN BOTH LENDING AND LAND USE POLICIES. I THINK THE IMPORTANT THING IS TO LOOK AT THE EQUITY DENYING OPPORTUNITIES. YOU WANT TO STUDY THE HISTORY AND I GET THAT.
03:05:07.915: >> Planning Manager:  30 MORE SECONDS.
03:05:09.350: >> BEFORE LOOKING TOWARDS SOLUTIONS AND HOW TO REMEDY THAT I REALLY BELIEVE THAT AN OWNERSHIP COMPONENT IS IF A ARE MORE IMPORTANT FOCUS THAN, SAY, ZONING. MY TWO CENTS. THANKS FOR LISTENING. BYE.
03:05:27.835: >> Chair Mills: THANK YOU.
03:05:42.083: >> Planning Manager:  CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 556. CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 556, YOU CAN UNMUTE YOUR PHONE AND ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION FOR THREE MINUTES.
03:05:52.794: >> HI, THIS IS RALPH McKEY. CAN YOU HEAR ME?
03:05:55.129: >> Planning Manager:  YES.
03:05:56.264: >> Chair Mills: WE CAN.
03:05:57.565: >> I WOULD ECHO THE LAST POINT THAT TOM STULBERG MADE ABOUT THE HOMEOWNERSHIP COMPONENT. WHICH OBVIOUSLY RELATES TO THE -- WHETHER YOU CALL IT THE SINGLE-FAMILY ZONING COMMITTEE OR HAVE A MORE BROADER NAME. AND I THINK IN THIS COMMUNITY AND PARTICULARLY, I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN DOZENS OF PRETTY HEATED DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THIS TOPIC OVER THE LAST YEAR, AND MANY OF THEM SORT OF IGNORE THAT COMPONENT. AND THE EXACT IS THAT ONE OF THE BIGGEST HISTORICAL FACTORS IS NOT WHICH NEIGHBORHOODS MINORITIES WERE ALLOWED INTO, BUT DID THEY HAVE THE MONEY TO BUY THEIR OWN PLACE? AND FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHEN THAT
