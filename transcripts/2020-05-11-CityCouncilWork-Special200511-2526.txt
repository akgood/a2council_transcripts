00:00:18.478: >> Mayor Taylor: GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE, AND WELCOME TO THE MAE ANN ARBOR CITY COUNCIL. MR. CRAWFORD.
00:00:24.285: >> City Admin. Crawford: WE HAVE TWO PRESENTATIONS FOR YOU. FIRST ONE IS FROM ASSISTANT ADMINISTRATOR JOHN FORNIER, ASSISTED BY KIRK CRAWFORD FROM GCSI,'LL THEY WILL BE PRESENT ON YOUR LEGISLATIVE POLICY UPDATE.
00:00:37.765: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
00:00:39.166: >> I TAKE IT, THAT'S MY CUE.
00:00:42.803: >> City Admin. Crawford: IT IS.
00:00:43.471: >> Mayor Taylor: YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
00:00:52.680: >> FORGIVE ME. IF YOU ALL LOOK AT YOUR SCREEN, WE WILL SHARE A BRIEF POWERPOINT HERE. SO WE WANT TO SPEAK TO ALL OF YOU MEMBERS OF COUNCIL TONIGHT. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME AND I WANT TO INTRODUCE, KIRK PROFIT AND GARY OWEN, WHO THE CITY EMMOYS. SO WE'RE GOING TO DO A QUICK OVERVIEW OF SOME TOPICS OF INTEREST IN LANSING, ESPECIALLY RELATED TO STATE REVENUES AND A DISCUSSION GENERALLY OF THE ENVIRONMENT IN LANSING AND I WILL HAND IT OVER TO KIRK AND TO GARY, IF YOU GUYS WANT TO GIVE US YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS SECTION.
00:01:34.555: >> THANK YOU, JOHN. AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE WITH THE PUBLIC. YOU GUYS ARE LEADERS IN THE STATE TYPICALLY ON ALL MATTERS OF MUNICIPAL AND PUBLIC THOUGHT AND WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE PART OF THAT TEAM. IT IS, INDEED, A STRANGE TIME IN LANSING. THE LEGISLATURE REALLY HASN'T MET -- THEY HAVE MET SORT OF, YOU KNOW, ON A COUPLE OF OCCASIONS, BUT THEY BROKE BECAUSE OF COVID AND THE PANDEMIC RIGHT ABOUT MARCH 11th, MARCH 12th, SO IT'S BEEN CLOSE TO TWO MONTHS NOW. AND WE PRETTY MUCH OPERATED UNDER EMERGENCY ORDERS AS YOU KNOW. THE MOST RECENT BEING 2059 AND THEN THE ADDITIONAL PIECES THAT COME OUT IN IT TO HELP EXPLAIN AND FURTHER ELABORATE ON PARTICULAR PIECES OF THAT GENERAL ORDER. AND AS YOU KNOW, THE EXECUTIVE ORDER ABILITY AND STATUTE HAS BEEN CHALLENGED BY THE LEGISLAURE. NOW WE HAVE A BIT OF A FIGHT IN LANSING ABOUT WHO HAS THE AUTHORITY TO DO THIS SORT OF ACTIVITY. IT'S IN COURT. THE PLEADINGS HAVE BEEN FILED AND IT'S CAUSED A BIT OF CONTENTIOUSNESS AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE, BETWEEN THE EXECUTIVE AND THE LEGISLATIVE OFFICES, BUT THE REALITY IS THE GOVERNOR IS CONTINUING TO GOVERN AS THE STATUTES, BOTH OF THEM REQUIRE UNDER EMERGENCY DECLARATIONS. AND WE EXPECT THAT TO CONTINUE FOR A WHILE. I THINK THE REALITY IS, AS YOU HAVE SEEN, THINGS WILL CONTINUE TO CHANGE EVEN WITH EACH OF THOSE BROADER EXECUTIVE ORDERS. YOU SAW THIS WEEK, CONSTRUCTION BEGIN AGAIN, AND YOU WILL CONTINUE TO SEE, I THINK, AS THE TREND LINE CONTINUES MORE FAVORABLY, A CONTINUING APPROACH TO MORE ACTIVITY BEING PERMISSIBLE UNDER THESE DECLARATIONS. AND AS ALWAYS, IN ANY OF THOSE, WE HAVE WORKED RECENTLY WITH JOHN ON A PIECE, AND TOM, WHO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT EVEN THIS SORT OF ACTIVITY WHERE WE'RE TRYING TO BE RESPONSIVE TO THE OPEN MEETING ACT AND DISCLOSURE AND SUNSHINE LAWS AND THAT SORT OF THING AND YOU GUYS HAVE DONE A GREAT JOB, BUT IT'S BEEN AWKWARD A LITTLE BIT, DOING IT ON TWO-WEEK PIECES. AND TO YOUR CREDIT AND THE RESPONSE TO JOHN AND TOM'S REQUEST, THE GOVERNOR RESPONDED WITH AN EXTENSION OF THAT PIECE, THROUGH THE END OF JUNE. SO THE POINT OF THAT IS TO GIVE SOME CREDIT TO JOHN AND TOM FOR TRYING TO GET A BETTER HANDLE ON HOW TO PROCEED WITH THESE SORTS OF ACTIVITIES. BUT ALSO THAT, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU HAVE ISSUES, WE CAN TRY TO SEE IF WE CAN IMPACT THEM WITH THE EXECUTIVE OFFICE. MY EXPERIENCE WITH THE GOVERNOR IS SHE WILL KEEP PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE ECONOMY IN FOREMOST FOCUS, BUT SHE WILL WORK WITH THESE TYPE OF REQUESTS AS SHE CAN. COVID AND EMERGING NOW THE BUDGET WILL CONSUME MOST OF THE OXYGEN IN LANSING. JOHN HAS A NUMBER OF PIECES THAT HE'S BEEN PURSUING WITH US LEGISLATIVELY, BUT THERE'S REALLY NO LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITY ON ANYTHING OTHER THAN COVID SINCE MARCH, THE BEGINNING OF MARCH. AND EVEN THEN IT WAS STARTING TO BE -- THE OXYGEN WAS STARTING TO TOBE CONSUMED BY BUDGET. AS WE GO FORWARD, THAT'S LIKELY TO BE THE CASE. WE WILL CONTINUE TO WATCH FOR OPPORTUNITIES. I WOULD RECOGNIZE LEGISLATIVELY BEFORE THIS PANDEMIC WE WERE ABLE TO COMPLETE WITH THE SUPPORT OF JOHN AND TOM AND PREVIOUSLY HOWARD, AND SEVERAL OF YOU ON COUNCIL, THE TREATMENT OF SOLAR PANELS FOR RESIDENTIAL USE. SO THAT WAS A GOOD PIECE TO FINALLY FINISH AFTER SEVERAL YEARS OF CONFUSION OVER THE TREATMENT OF IT. I WOULD REMIND FOLKS THAT WE WILL HAVE A BUDGET -- A REVENUE ESTIMATE ON MAY 15th, AT THE END OF THIS WEEK. THAT WILL HELP TO DRIVE THE BUDGET DELIBERATIONS A LITTLE MORE WITH A LITTLE BETTER DEFINITION. THE BUDGET IS STATUTORILY DUE NOW AFTER LEGISLATION THAT WAS PASSED LAST YEAR. IT IS STATUTORILY DUE ON THE GOVERNOR'S DESK BY JULY 1st. AND I THINK IT'S STILL THE LEGISLATURE'S INTENT -- WE HAD I ACONFERENCE CALL WITH SOME SUBCOMMITTEE CHAIRS ON THE BUDGET EARLIER TODAY AND I BELIEVE IT'S STILL THEIR INTENT TO DO JUST THAT. IT'S CERTAINLY CONDENSED IN A SHORTENED PERIOD OF TIME AND THEY HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT IN STRANGE CIRCUMSTANCES BUT THAT IS STILL THEIR INTENT TO COMPLETE BY JULY 1st. HAVING SAID THAT, WE DO EXPECT THAT THEY WILL ANNOUNCE ANOTHER EXTRAORDINARY SPECIAL REVENUE ESTIMATE TO BE DELIVERED IN AUGUST. SO YOU WOULD ANTICIPATE EVEN WITH A -- A COMPLETION OF THE BUDGET, JULY 1st, IF THAT DOES HAPPEN, MULTIPLE SUPPLEMENTAL BUDGETS TO GO ON THROUGH THE COURSE OF THE YEAR THAT MAY ADJUST THE SPENDING FEATURES. JUST IN TERMS OF NUMBERS, I WOULD REMIND US, AND I THINK TOM AND JOHN AND YOUR BUDGET TEAM HAVE A PRETTY GOOD HANDLE ON THIS, BUT THE CITY RIGHT NOW GETS CLOSE TO 2 MILLION FROM -- FIRE PROTECTION GRANTS THAT YOU LED THE WAY TO SECURE OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS AND THAT PIECE SHOULD BE SECURE. REVENUE SHARING, YOU GET ABOUT 10.2 FROM CONSTITUTIONAL REVENUE SHARING, ABOUT 1.7 FROM STATUTORY. CONSTITUTIONAL REVENUE SHARING IS LARGELY SALES TAX. AS YOU KNOW, THAT WILL BE IMPACTED BY THIS ECONOMY, AND WHAT'S HAPPENED WITH COVID. SO YOU WOULD ANTICIPATE SOME SORT OF ADJUSTMENT IN THAT PIECE. CONSTITUTIONAL PIECE SHOULD BE PROTECTED, SURPRISINGLY AND IT'S MORE AT RISK THROUGH THE COURSE OF TIME, BUT IN THE SHORT TERM HERE, THAT 1.7 SHOULD BE PROTECTED. ADDITIONALLY, YOUR ACT 51 DOLLARS ARE GOING TO BE IMPACTED, AGAIN, BECAUSE THAT'S FUEL TAXES AND REGISTRATION FEES. I SUSPECT REGULAR REGISTRATION E HELD CONSTANT BUT THE FUEL FEES ARE DRASTICALLY IMPACTED. WITH, THAT I THINK WE HAVE BEEN EXPECTING FOR A WHILE, MARIJUANA MONEY AND GARY OWEN IS WITH ME TODAY ON THE ZOOM. I DON'T KNOW, GARY, IF YOU WANT TO ADD A FEW COMMENTS TO THE LAY OF THE LAND IN LANSING AND A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MARIJUANA.
00:08:20.561: >> SURE. WE CLARIFIED THIS WITH THE STATE TREASURER AND THE HOUSE FISCAL. THE WAY THAT SOME OF THOSE FEES WORK IS WITH THE TRANSITION FROM MEDICAL TO RECREATIONAL CANNABIS, IT WILL ALLOW FOR ZERO PERCENT EXCISE FEE ON ALL MEDICAL SALES AND WE'LL TRANSITION TO A 10% EXCISE FEE IN RECREATIONAL AND WHEN THE STATE DID THIS, THEY ANTICIPATED A LOT MORE CITIES THAN HAVE TO DATE TRANSITIONED TO RECREATIONAL RIGHT AWAY. AND SO CITIES LIKE DETROIT AND OTHER AREAS THAT WILL HAVE A LARGE NUMBER OF FACILITIES HAVE REMAINED IN THE MEDICAL MARKET AND SO THE WAY THAT THE LEGISLATION WAS ACTUALLY WRITTEN IS THAT IT'S ACTUALLY A -- THE BALLOT INITIATIVE WAS ACTUALLY WRITTEN WAS FIRST 20 MILLION IS TAKEN OFF THE TOP, ALL STATE DEPARTMENTS MUST BE TAKEN CARE OF, AND THEN THE MONIES WILL FLOW TO THE CITIES BASED OPEN THE NUMBER OF FACILITIES AND TRADITIONAL REVENUE SHARING-TYPE ANNUAL PAYMENTS SOMETIME IN OCTOBER. AND SO WHAT WE DON'T KNOW IS WHAT THOSE NUMBERS WILL LOOK LIKE. WHAT WE DON'T KNOW IS WHAT THOSE STATE DEPARTMENTS WILL CLAIM AS COSTS AND, OF COURSE, YOU KNOW, IN YEAR ONE HERE, WE'RE GOING TO -- THERE WILL BE SEVERAL ADJUSTMENTS BASED ON REACTIONS FROM CITIES, BASED ON REACTIONS FROM LEGISLATORS, ON HOW THOSE DOLLARS ARE DIVVIED UP AND I'M SURE THAT WILL BE AN EVER EVOLVING PROCESS, AS FOLKS DO SOME CHECKS AND BALANCES ON, YOU KNOW, WHAT THE DEPARTMENTS ACTUALLY NEED, VERSUS WHAT THEY ARE CLAIMING AS FAR AS START-UP COSTS AND -- AND THINGS THAT GO INTO LAUNCHING SUCH A LARGE BUREAUCRATIC EFFORT TO GET THESE FACILITIES LICENSED, ET CETERA. ANN ARBOR BEING ONE OF THE FIRST WILL COLLECT PROBABLY A LARGE CLUNK OF THE EARLY EXCISE MONEY, AND I'M UNSURE ABOUT SOME OF THE OTHER CITIES, HOW MANY FACILITIES THEY HAVE AND HOW THAT WILL BE DIVVIED UP, FOR EXAMPLE, YOU KNOW, A CITY LIKE DETROIT WILL HAVE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 75 AND 100 RETAIL AND THEN SEVERAL MORE OF THE PROCESSING CULTIVATION, ET CETERA, WHERE THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR WILL HAVE CLOSER TO 18, 20, RETAIL, SOME CULTIVATION, SOME PROCESSING, A LAB OR TWO, ET CETERA. AND SO THOSE WILL ALL COME OUT. WE WILL HAVE A REPORT BASICALLY IN OCTOBER AND THEN WE'LL CERTAINLY NEED IMPACT -- YOU KNOW, YOUR REACTION TO TAKE BACK AND -- AND, YOU KNOW, GET SOME FEEDBACK IN THE TREASURY ON THE WAY THEY SET UP THE SYSTEM. I THINK IN YEAR ONE OF THE LONG-TERM SYSTEM, THAT WILL BE IMPORTANT AND THEN THOSE FINAL RULES HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED TO THE LEGISLATURE. SO THAT IS WHAT A LOT OF CITIES HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR. AND THAT FINAL RULE PACKAGE IS BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE NOW AND SHOULD BE APPROVED HERE RELATIVELY SHORTLY, WHICH WILL GIVE CAN FOLKS SOME MORE LONG-TERM UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE REGULATORY SYSTEM LOOKS LIKE. ANY OTHER TOPICS YOU WOULD LIKE ME TO COVER, KIRK? I DON'T WANT TO --
00:11:26.079: >> LET'S STOP THIS FOR A MINUTE. THESE ZOOMS CAN BE A CHALLENGE, BECAUSE YOU CAN'T REALLY READ BODY LANGUAGE OR TO SEE IF SOMEBODY IS -- YOU KNOW, WE CAN MOMOMONOTONE. SHOULD WE STOP THERE, JOHN? SHOULD WE PROCEED?
00:11:43.663: >> I THINK THAT WAS THE EXTENT OF WHAT WE HAD DISCUSSED YOU ALL PRESENTING. IT MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE IF THERE ARE -- WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT, I CAN GO THROUGH AND DISCUSS THE LEGISLATION THAT THE CITY HAS BEEN SPECIFICALLY PURSUING, AND THEN MAYBE WE CAN TAKE A PAUSE OF THAT. HOW DOES THAT SOUND? SO -- SO I JUST WANT TO SPEAK BRIEFLY, KIRK AND GARY HAD TOUCHED ON THIS THE LEGISLATURE'S WORK HAS COME TO A CRAWL. FOR SOME COMMITTEES WORKING AND SOME FLOOR SESSIONS THAT HAVE BEEN CALLED BUT UNLESS THERE'S SOME TYPE OF MOVEMENT FROM THE LEGISLATURE TO ADOPT VIRTUAL MEETING RULES OR SOME OTHER METHOD THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD MEET IN THE FUTURE, I WOULD ANTICIPATE THAT UNTIL WE COME TO SOME KIND OF TURNING POINT WITH THE PANDEMIC, THAT WORK IN THE LEGISLATURE IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE VERY SLOW DURING THIS PERIOD. SO KEEPING THAT IN MIND, I WANTED TO RUN THROUGH SOME OF THE BILLS THAT WE HAVE BEEN FOCUSING ON IN ANN ARBOR. YOU KNOW, THE UPSHOT FOR COUNCIL IS THAT SINCE THE LAST REPORT I PROVIDED YOU ON LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITY, THERE'S BEEN NO MOVEMENT ON ANY OF THATS BIL TH. I THINK LAST REPORTED TO YOU IN JANUARY AND, OF COURSE, SHORTLY THEREAFTER, THINGS HAVE BEEN FROZEN BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC. A FEW UPDATES WORTH NOTING. AS YOU RECALL LAST YEAR DURING THE LAME DUCK SESSION, THERE WAS WORK TO STOP THE VEGETATION PREEMPTION BILLS, AS THEY ARE CALLED. THERE'S SOME TALK ABOUT THESE BILLS BEING REINTRODUCED INTO THE LEGISLATURE. NOTHING HAS BEEN INTRODUCED AT THIS POINT. BUT IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT A FEDERAL COURT DID JUST INVALIDATE THE TOWNSHIP OF CANTON'S HERITAGE TREE ORDINANCE. I HAVE REFERRED THAT TO THE CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE AND THEY ARE LOOKING AT WHAT KIND OF AN IMPACT THAT MIGHT HAVE ON THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. BUT, YOU KNOW, WHENEVER THERE ARE COURT DECISIONS OF THIS TYPE THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO SPUR LEGISLATION. SO WE WILL KEEP OUR EYES OPEN FOR THAT. ON BOTH DARK STORES, AND TAX EXEMPTION OF TELECOM EQUIPMENT, THOSE BILLS HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED. NO HEARINGS HAVE BEEN HELD AT THIS POINT. THE SHORT-TERM RENTAL ZONING PREEMPTION LEGISLATION OF COUNCIL HAS ASKED US TO KEEP AN EYE ON, THAT IS STILL STALLED IN NEGOTIATIONS. THE LOCAL PLASTIC BAG BANS LEGISLATION HAS BEEN INTRODUCED, BUT NO HEARING IS SCHEDULED. THE INCREASED SCHOOL ZONE, SPEEDING FINES HAS BEEN INTRODUCED BUT NO HEARING HAS BEEN SCHEDULED. THE BILL TO ALLOW GREATER LOCAL CONTROL OF SPEED LIMITS HAS BEEN INTRODUCED BUT NO HEARING HAS BEEN SCHEDULED. THAT BILL, I WILL JUST FLAG, WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT IF LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITY CAN RESUME TO SOME KIND OF NORMAL, THAT THAT BILL HAS A GOOD CHANCE OF MOVING. ON THE COMMUNITY SOLAR BILL, HB4995, THAT HAS BEEN INTRODUCED BUT NO HEARING SCHEDULES. THERE'S A SERIES OF BILLS THAT COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER HAD ASKED US TO KEEP AN EYE ON, RELATED TO THE LOOSENING OF GUN RESTRICTIONS. ALMOST ALL OF THESE BILLS HAVE GONE NOWHERE. ONE OF THEM, BILL 4020 PASSED THE HOUSE AND THAT RELATES TO CONCEALED WEAPONS BUT IT HAS NOT BEEN ASSIGNED TO A COMMITTEE IN THE SENATE, AND SO THERE'S SOME DOUBT AS TO WHETHER THAT BILL HAS MUCH OF A FUTURE. AND SO LIKE I SAID, THE BILLS THAT WE'RE TRACKING AND THAT WE'RE WORKING ON, THERE REALLY HAS NOT BEEN AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MUCH WORK TO MOVE FORWARD ON THEM, SINCE I LAST SPOKE TO COUNCIL ON THIS LEGISLATION. BUT WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT WE -- YOU KNOW, THINGS IN LANSING CAN KIND OF SETTLE INTO SOME KIND OF FUNCTIONAL NORMAL AS WE MOVE FURTHER INTO THIS  PANDEMIC AND LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITY. AT THAT POINT, I THINK THAT'S THE BULK OF THE PRESENTATION WE HAVE NOW, AND I WILL -- IF THERE ARE QUESTIONS, THAT'S FINE. REALLY UP TO THE MAYOR AND TOM, AS TO HOW YOU WANT TO MOVE FORWARD.
00:16:17.537: >> Mayor Taylor: SURE. IF ANYBODY HAS ANY QUESTIONS. I DON'T HAVE ANY YET -- I DON'T SEE ANY HANDS RAISED. COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
00:16:33.253: >> Councilmember Bannister:  I WAS JUST WONDERING IF THERE WAS ANY FURTHER DETAIL ON PREEMPTION OF CANTON'S HERITAGE TREE ORDINANCE, JUST THIS -- SAYING THE PROPERTY OWNER HAD ALL THE RIGHTS ON THAT, AND THE COMMUNITY --
00:16:50.103: >> THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION, COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER. WHAT ORIGINALLY HAD SPAWNED THIS LEGISLATIVE ACTION IN THE LAME DUCK CENTER WAS A PROPERTY OWNER IN CANTON, I BELIEVE OFF MICHIGAN AVENUE, AND THEY WENT THROUGH AND HAD CUT DOWN THEIR TREES WITHOUT CONSULTING WITH THE TOWNSHIP, AND, YOU KNOW, MANY COMMUNITIES IN MICHIGAN, INCLUDING ANN ARBOR HAVE HERITAGE TREE ORDINANCES THAT REQUIRE YOU TO KEEP TRACK OF THE SIZE AND THE TYPE OF TREES AND YYOU ARE ALLOWED TO THEM AND DO WHATEVER WITH THEM, BUT IT'S SUBJECT TO SOME RESTRICTIONS. YOU KNOW, THERE SOME REPLANTING RESTRICTIONS, DONATIONS TO THE TREE PLANTING FUNDS THAT THE LOCAL GO  GOVERNMENTS RUN AND TS PROPERTY OWNER IN CANTON DIDN'T PARTICIPATE IN ANY OF THOSE PROGRAMS. SO THE PROPERTY OWNER WENT TO THEIR REPRESENTATIVES IN THE LEGISLATURE AND ASKED FOR LEGISLATION THAT WOULD BAN HERITAGE TREE ORDINANCES. AND THAT -- AND REALLY THE WAY THE LEGISLATION WAS WRITTEN, IT WOULD HAVE BANNED ANY TYPE OF VEGETATION REGULATION, PERIOD. SO FOR INSTANCE, IF YOU WERE DEVELOPING A PROPERTY AND THE LOCAL JURISDICTION SAID YOU NEED SOME WETLAND MITIGATION AND BUFFERS HERE, PRETTY COMMON THINGS FOR ZONING AND DEVELOPMENT, THAT WOULD ALL HAVE BEEN ILLEGAL. AND SO THE -- A PIECE OF LEGISLATION WAS INTRODUCED AND THERE WAS QUITE AN OUTCRY DURING THE LAME DUCK SESSION AND IT ENDED UP NOT PASSING. SO THE PROPERTY OWNER WHO ORIGINALLY SPAWNED THIS WHOLE DEBATE SUED CANTON TOWNSHIP IN FEDERAL COURT AND THE COURT DECIDED JUST LAST WEEK, THAT CANTON'S HERITAGE TREE ORDINANCE WAS, YOU KNOW, ILLEGAL IN SOME I WHAT. I'M NOT GOING TO PURPORT TO BE AN ATTORNEY, BUT, YOU KNOW, WE'RE -- SO THERE'S A QUESTION NOW AS TO HOW THIS ISSUE GETS RESOLVED IN ANN ARBOR AND OTHER COMMUNITIES IN THE LEGISLATURE AND WHAT HAVE YOU. SO THE ONE THING I CAN PROMISE YOU IS THAT THE ISSUE IS NOT OVER WITH. BUT IN TERMS OF MORE LEGAL DETAIL, WE'RE WAITING ANALYSIS FROM THE CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE.
00:19:19.719: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
00:19:20.720: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANKS. THANKS AGAIN FOR PUTTING THIS TOGETHER, MR. PROFIT AND MR. OWEN FOR ATTENDING TONIGHT. WE DIDN'T GET TO HEAR THEM VERY OFTEN AND HAVE THIS TYPE OF A WORK SESSION. SO IT'S DEFINITELY WELCOMED. BUT UNFORTUNATELY, IT'S DEPRESSING. YOU ARE HEARING ABOUT BIG CUTS COMING TO THE CITY AND WE HAVE TO ADOPT OUR BU BUDGET NEXT WEEK AND WE PROBABLY HAVE A PLAN B AND THAT WILL PROBABLY BE LIKE PLAN BB BEFORE WE KNOW IT, WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT CHANGING THINGS. AND WE TALKED ABOUT THE CONSTITUTIONAL AND THE STATUTORY FUNDING WE RECEIVED FROM THE STATE. MR. PROFIT, YOU DESCRIBED, 10.2 MILLION, AND $7.1 MILLION, THE CONSTITUTIONAL SHARE BEING THE 10.2 AND THE STATUTORY BEING THE 7.1, IS THAT CORRECT?
00:20:18.177: >> 1.7 FOR STATUTORY.
00:20:20.413: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THAT'S FOR THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR?
00:20:23.049: >> THAT'S FOR THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR, THAT'S CORRECT. YES, THE TOTAL --
00:20:27.387: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  SO ROUGHLY $2 MILLION IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL STATE REVENUE SHARING BUT JUST 1.7 IN THE MORE VOLATILE STATUTORY.
00:20:37.030: >> YES, IT TURNS OUT -- THE CONSTITUTIONAL IS -- IS -- IS PRETTY MUCH SALES TAX, AND IT'S NOT REALLY LEGISLATIVELY DETERMINED. IT'S JUST A FORMULA. SO IT REALLY CAN'T BE IMPACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE, BUT IT WILL BE IMPACTED BECAUSE OF THEY DIDE DIMINISHED SALES TAX.
00:21:00.320: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I UNDERSTAND THAT, BEING A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER. I'M SPENDING ZERO, STARTING YESTERDAY OR TODAY. BUT FOR US AT THE CITY LEVEL, JUST UNDERSTANDING HOW -- HOW WE CAN BETTER MANAGE AND PLAN, I'M NOT SO -- YOU KNOW, IT'S GOOD TO KNOW THAT THOSE NUMBERS ARE NOT INVERTED AND WE'RE -- AND THAT THE SMALLER NUMBER IS THE MORE VOLATILE SALES TAX FIGURE VERSUS THE CONSTITUTIONAL ONE. SO THAT IS A RELIEF. I KNOW IT'S BAD, BUT AT LEAST THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF GOOD NEWS. I WANTED TO MAKE SURE I GOT THAT RIGHT. AND THEN MR. OWEN, YOU DESCRIBED THE REVENUE COMING FROM THE MARIJUANA TAX, ON RECREATIONAL ACCESS TAXES AND YOU DESCRIBED IT IN OCTOBER, WE WOULD BE HAVING A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT -- WHAT THAT MORE OR LESS LOOKS LIKE. RIGHT NOW IT'S JUST TOO UNCLEAR?
00:21:55.508: >> YES, THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER. WELL, WHAT ESSENTIALLY HAPPENED WITH THE BALLOT INITIATIVE IS THAT THEY WERE ALREADY ROLLING UNDER THE MEDICAL SYSTEM. AND SO PART OF THE -- PART OF THE INITIATIVE WAS THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE TO RELICENSE ESSENTIALLY EVERY FACILITY IN THE STATE UNDER A NEW PROGRAM. SO WHAT THEY DID IS THEY SHIFTED IN THE BALLOT INITIATIVE. THEY PUT A 10% EXCISE TAX ON ALL SALES. SO AT THE REGISTER, ALL SALES, THERE IS A 10% EXCISE TAX AT THE RETAIL FACILITY. THAT MONEY GOES TO THE STATE AND IT'S DIVVIED UP WITHIN THE BALLOT INITIATIVE. IT WAS DIVVIED UP. FIRST THERE'S 10 MILLION THAT COMES OFF THE TOP, I BELIEVE, FOR -- FOR STATE PROGRAM -- I FORGET THE EXACT LANGUAGE AND THEN EACH -- EACH ONE OF THE DEPARTMENTS ESSENTIALLY SUBMITS THEIR COSTS ON DOING IT AND THOSE DEPARTMENTS INCLUDE ONLY THE STATE POLICE, AND THE MARIJUANA REGULATORY AGENCY, LICENSING AND REGULATORY AFFAIRS WILL HAVE SOME SMALL COSTS, BUT MARIJUANA REGULATORY AGENCY IS PART OF THAT DEPARTMENT AND THEN OF COURSE --
00:23:10.583: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I'M SORRY TO CULT YOU OFF, BUT IN ADDITION TO THE 20 MILLION?
00:23:14.220: >> YES. YES. THE FIRST 20 AND I DON'T WANT TO CALL IT A STUDY, BUT I BELIEVE IT GOES INTO SOME SORT OF RESEARCH [ DOG BARKING ] AND I CAN GET BACK TO YOU WITH THE EXACT LANGUAGE.
00:23:26.432: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THAT'S FINE. I DON'T NEED TO GET GRANULAR.
00:23:29.669: >> IN ADDITION TO THE 20. AND THE WAY IT WILL WORK, THE STATE IS ON A BUDGET YEAR OPEN OCTOBER 1. THEY'LL FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHAT THEY WERE ABLE TO COLLECT, WHAT THE EXPENSES WERE FOR THEIR DEPARTMENTS AND THEN THEY WILL DIVVY THAT MONEY UP TO THE CITIES BASED ON THE NUMBER OF FACILITIES WITHIN EACH COMMUNITY.
00:23:52.725: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  AND THAT NUMBER, THAT FIGURE IS LESS THAN ONE CALENDAR YEAR, CORRECT? THIS WENT INTO EFFECT AFTER LAST OCTOBER. SO WE ARE NOT DEALING WITH A FULL CALENDAR YEAR OF REVENUE, IN TERMS OF THAT FORMULA?
00:24:06.672: >> THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S RIGHT. AND ACTUALLY, THE NUMBERS WILL BE GREATLY AUGMENTED SPECIFICALLY FOR THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR AS THE LARGER CITIES COME ON BOARD. BECAUSE IT'S NOT A POLICY IN WHICH, YOU KNOW, YOU COLLECT FROM ALL THE FACILITIES FROM YOUR COMMUNITY. WHEN SOMEONE OF THE LARGER AREAS IN OAKLAND, WAYNE, MACOMB, ET CETERA, COME ON BOARD AND START PRODUCING SIGNIFICANT REVENUES FROM THAT 10%, ANN ARBOR WILL BENEFIT MORE THAN THEY DO TODAY, BECAUSE THEY HAVE 18 FACILITIES. YOU WON'T PRODUCE THE LEVEL OF FEES LIKE DETROIT AND SO MANY FACILITIES IN THAT METRO REGION WILL PRODUCE. RIGHT NOW, YOU WILL ESSENTIALLY BE A DONOR COMMUNITY IN THAT ASPECT BECAUSE THERE'S SEVERAL COMMUNITIES AROUND THE STATE THAT HAVE SEVERAL FACILITIES ALL OVER THE STATE, UP NORTH, BAY COUNTY, SAGINAW, ET CETERA, THAT HAVE SEVERAL FACILITIES WITHIN THEM. FLINT AND -- AND THEY ARE NOT GOING TO PRODUCE THE REVENUE, BELIEVE IT OR NOT, THAT EVEN THE 18 STORES IN ANN ARBOR WILL, WHICH WILL BE MUCH MORE SIGNIFICANT, BECAUSE THE PRICE PER TICKET WILL BE MUCH HIGHER IN THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. SO AS THE DETROITS, THE OAKLAND COUNTIES THOSE STORES START COMING ON AND PRODUCING SIGNIFICANT REVENUES, THE NUMBER OF FACILITIES THAT ANN ARBOR HAS PER -- YOU KNOW, PER CAPITA WILL -- WILL ALLOW FOR YOUR POOL TO BE BIGGER. AND WE ANTICIPATE MOST OF THOSE CITIES MOVING FORWARD NOW THAT THE RULES ARE FINAL. THERE WERE SEVERAL CITY ATTORNEYS AND CITY COUNCILS AND OTHER FOLKS IN THESE AREAS THAT MADE DELIBERATE DECISIONS EARLY ON TO SAY, WELL, WE'LL JUST WAIT UNTIL THE RULES ARE OUT AND FINALIZED AND IT'S NOT EMERGENCY RULE OR DRAFT RULE, ET CETERA. MAYBE THAT DIDN'T HAVE THE TYPE OF ECONOMY OF THIS NATURE, LIKE ANN ARBOR DID PREVIOUSLY. THEY DIDN'T HAVE FACILITIES THAT NEEDED TO REACT TO THEY HAD TO START IT FROM SCRATCH. AND WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THE FINAL RULE PACKAGE AND NOW THAT THAT'S FINAL, WE ANTICIPATE ANTE BETWEEN NOW AND END OF THE YEAR A LOT OF THOSE ORDINANCES BEING ADOPTED.
00:26:38.991: >> Mayor Taylor: LET'S GO WITH COUNCILMEMBER LUMM AND TRY TO BE DONE WITH 7:30, IF WE CAN TO WE CAN GET ON TO THE OTHER SUBJECT MATTER.
00:26:45.798: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU.
00:26:47.133: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
00:26:49.068: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANKS, MR. MAYOR AND THANK YOU, MR. PROFIT AND MR. OWEN, MR. FORNIER FOR YOUR EXCELLENT ADVOCACY AND WORK ON YOUR BEHALF UP IN LANSING AND THIS UPDATE TONIGHT. IT'S VERY INFORMATIVE. AND EVEN THOUGH THERE'S NOT A LOT GOING ON UP IN LANSING RIGHT NOW, BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. APPRECIATE ALL OF YOUR GOOD WORK ON OUR BEHALF. A QUICK QUESTION ABOUT THE SHORT-TERM RENTAL ZONING PREEMPTION. AS YOU INDICATED, IT STALLED IN NEGOTIATIONS AND I'M WONDERING IF YOU COULD JUST REMIND US, WHO IS AT THE NEGOTIATING TABLE?
00:27:30.342: >> WELL, YOU KNOW --
00:27:32.945: >> Councilmember Lumm: SO MANY STAKEHOLDERS, INTERESTED STAKEHOLDERS.
00:27:36.615: >> WELL, I WOULD INVITE KIRK TO HELP ANSWER THIS QUESTION, AS WELL. I KNOW THIS IS A BIG ISSUE UP IN LANSING, BUT IT'S NOT AS IF THERE ARE THERE ARE MANY MEETINGS AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE, IT'S SIMPLY BEING DONE BEHIND CLOSED DOORS WITH -- YOU KNOW, INVOLVING REALTORS AND THE HOTELIERS AND THINGS OF THAT -- PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THOSE CONSTITUENCIES AND COMMUNITIES ARE INVOLVED IN THAT DISCUSSION AS WELL. BUT KIRK, DO YOU HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF WHO IS -- WHO IS CONTRIBUTING TO THOSE NEGOTIATIONS?
00:28:06.912: >> YEAH, I DON'T REALLY THINK THERE'S MUCH NEGOTIATION AT ALL RIGHT NOW. THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY HAS BEEN DEVASTATED BY -- BY THIS COVID. BUT BEFORE ALL OF THIS STARTED, THERE WAS PRETTY MUCH A STALEMATE BETWEEN HOTELIERS AND REAL ESTATE INTERESTS. HOTELIERS SAID FINE, YOU WANT TO DO THAT, WE WILL DO THIS. AND BETWEEN THEIR KIND OF COMPETING ACTIVITIES, IT BASICALLY BLOCKED ANYTHING FROM HAPPENING ON THAT LEGISLATION. SO IN TERMS OF PROGNOSIS, I DON'T ANTICIPATE YOU BEING PREEMPTED FROM TRYING TO DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO WITH THAT STUFF. CERTAINLY NOT IN THE NEAR FUTURE. I DON'T EXPECT THE ISSUE TO GO AWAY. I THINK WE WILL HAVE TO STAY VIGILANT AND ATTENTIVE, BUT I DON'T EXPECT THOSE SEEKING THE PREEMPTIVE FOLKS WILL HAVE ANY SUCCESS WITH THAT, ESPECIALLY IN THE NEXT FUTURE.
00:29:02.701: >> STALLED IS THE WORD THERE, YEAH.
00:29:04.503: >> I WOULD SAY THIS EVEN MORE BROADLY, WITH -- IN THE CONTEXT OF COVID. I THINK THERE IS AN ENERGY, YOU KNOW, WITH ANYTHING LIKE THIS, AND I THINK WE WANT TO LOOK FOR OPPORTUNITIES WITH THE ENERGY FROM IT, TO BE AGGRESSIVE AND PLAY OFFENSE. YOU KNOW, WE HAVE KNOWN FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT FINANCE DOES NOT WORK WITH HEADLEY AND PROP 8 AND I THINK WE USE THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE FORWARD. WE KNOW THE IMPACT OF MANY THINGS THAT GO ON IN AMERICAN CULTURE HAVE DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACTS ON MORE DISTRESSED POPULATIONS AND ESPECIALLY AS WE HAVE SEEN IN THIS CASE, IN 197, 198 ZIP CODES, WHICH ARE LARGELY BLACK POPULATIONS IN THAT CONTEXT. WE SEE CERTAIN ACTIVITIES IN THE CONTEXT OF VOTING. I KNOW JACK HAS BEEN WORKING VERY HARD WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO CORRECT A LITTLE BITTY PROBLEM WITH YOUR ANNEXED PROPERTY, BUT WE MIGHT WANT TO LOOK FOR BROADER OPPORTUNITIES IN THE CONTEXT OF VOTING OPPORTUNITIES. I WOULD SAY THIS IN TERMS OF VARIABLES TO WATCH FOR, AS WE GO FORWARD WITH YOUR BUDGET, THERE'S THE REVENUE ESTIMATE FRIDAY. THERE'S A REVENUE ESTIMATE IN AUGUST. THERE'S A BUDGET DELIBERATIONS OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS. AND I THINK WE WANT TO WATCH FOR CARES 4, IF THERE IS A CARES 4 OR ANOTHER SUPPLEMENTAL COMING OUT OF LANSING. AS TO WHAT'S GOING TO BE ALLOWED, THERE WILL CONTINUE TO BE MORE THICKS  THINGS THAT ARED AS WE GO FORWARD. AND THE LAST THING THAT AFFECT LANSING, THE LARGE GATHERINGS LIKE FOOTBALL GAMES LIKE CONCERTS AND ALL THE SUMMER ACTIVITIES THAT ARE SO POPULAR AND SO SUCCESSFUL IN ANN ARBOR. OBVIOUSLY THOSE WILL BE THE LAST TYPES OF THINGS TO BE ABLE TO TAKE PLACE. SO, YOU KNOW, THOSE ARE IMPACTS THAT I'M SURE YOU HAVE TO PLAN FOR ALMOST IN THE REVERSE, BUT I DID WANT TO MENTION THE ENERGY THAT COMES FROM SOME OF THESE THINGS THAT WE SHOULD USE POSITIVELY AND START TO PLAY OFFENSE. I KNOW ONE OF THE PRIMARY TARGETS IS CULTURAL ARTS FOR MANY ON COUNCIL AND IN YOUR PRIORITY LIST THAT YOU DEVELOPED LAST YEAR. WE'RE ALREADY PURSUING A DIFFERENT APPROACH AND PERHAPS A MORE COORDINATED AND COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH WITH THE EXECUTIVE OFFICE TO CULTURAL ARTS. EVEN THOUGH THIS LEGISLATURE OBVIOUSLY CAN'T DO MUCH RIGHT NOW, MAKE NO MISTAKE, THIS EXECUTIVE OFFICE IS WORKING HARD, YOU KNOW, 24/7. IT'S PRETTY MUCH DONE THROUGH EXECUTIVE ORDER RIGHT NOW, BUT I WOULD WATCH FOR THESE OPPORTUNITIES TO MAKE THINGS HAPPEN AS YOU WOULD WANT TO DO, MANY TIMES INDEPENDENT OF THE LEGISLATURE. WE WILL WORK WHEN IT'S THERE, BUT IF IT'S NOT, THERE WE WANT TO BE IN A POSITION TO DO SO FOR YOU.
00:31:53.372: >> Mayor Taylor: EXCELLENT. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THAT'S -- THAT IS HELPFUL AND HEARTENING AND WE'LL LOOK FOR, YOU KNOW, OPPORTUNITIES TO BE OPPORTUNISTIC. THANK YOU.
00:32:04.450: >> THANK YOU. APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO JOIN YOU TONIGHT.
00:32:07.453: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU SO MUCH.
00:32:08.721: >> THANK YOU, MAYOR.
00:32:10.356: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU, BOTH. MANY CRMR. CRAWFORD, YOU HAVE T.
00:32:19.498: >> City Admin. Crawford: UNLIKE THE LEGISLATIVE HEAR, THE FINANCIAL ACTIVITY HAS SEEN A LOT OF ACTIVITY. LET ME SHARE SOME OF THAT WITH YOU. OKAY. EVERYBODY SEE THAT?
00:32:47.593: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
00:32:48.494: >> City Admin. Crawford: SO THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF CHALLENGES WITH THIS COVID-19 PANDEMIC AND, YOU KNOW, TODAY SOME OF THE THINGS WE ARE GOING TO COVER, I WANT TO GIVE YOU AN UPDATE ON THE REVENUE SHORTFALLS AND WHAT WE ARE EXPECTING. ALSO GOING TO IDENTIFY SOME POTENTIAL ACTIONS THAT WE CAN DO TO ADDRESS THOSE SHORTFALLS, AND WE WOULD ALSO LIKE TO LISTEN TO YOU AND OTHERS ON IDEAS THAT WE HAVEN'T IDENTIFIED. AND SO THAT'S KIND OF OVERALL PLAN FOR TODAY. I'M HOPING TO PROVIDE YOU SOME TIME AT THE END OF THE PRESENTATION TO HAVE SOME CONVERSATION. AS BACKDROP TO THIS CONVERSATION, PLEASE RECALL THAT WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF OUR FISCAL YEAR '20, WHICH ENDS JUN. WHEN WE LOOK AT FISCAL YEAR '20, WE HAD FORECAST A USE OF FUND BALANCE OF $3.5 MILLION THIS YEAR. AT THE END OF THIS YEAR THEN, THIS IS EXCLUDING ANY COVID IMPACT, WE WOULD HAVE A FUND BALANCE OF ABOUT $16 MILLION OR 17% OF OUR EXPENDITURES. THAT IS TOWARD THE CENTER OF OUR POLICY RANGE, WHICH IS 15 TO 20%. AS WE -- THIS PRESENTATION IS GOING TO HAVE A NUMBER OF ASSUMPTIONS IN IT. THESE ARE ASSUMPTIONS WE WOULD HAD PREPARED PREVIOUSLY. WE BASICALLY CAME UP WITH AN OPTIMISTIC AND PESSIMISTIC SCENARIO. WE DID IT A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY THIS TIME. I WORKED WITH MATT HORNING AND THE REST OF STAFF AND CAME UP WITH KIND OF A MIDLINE SCENARIO AND THEN WE APPLIED A POSITIVE FACTOR IN FISCAL '20 OF 5%, AND I BELIEVE IT WAS 10% NEGATIVE TO CREATE A PESSIMISTIC RANGE IN '20. SO UP FIVE, DOWN 10, IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY. IN FISCAL '21, BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH MORE UNKNOWN, WE TOOK THE MIDDLE LINE SCENARIO, WHICH I WILL DESCRIBE FOR YOU IN A MOMENT AND THEN WE WENT UP 10% AND DOWN 25%. SO THAT'S HOW WE KIND OF CAME UP WITH THE RANGE. AGAIN, THE CITY'S PRIMARY ISSUES HAS BEEN AROUND REVENUES. THE EXPENDITURE HITS THAT WE HAVE HAD HAVE BEEN EITHER MINOR OR HITS THAT WE BELIEVE MAY BE REIMBURSABLE BY FEMA AT A LATER DATE. SO MOST OF THIS IS ON REVENUES. THE REVENUE PROJECTIONS THAT WE USED OR THE ASSUMPTIONS WE USED ARE FOR THE PARKING REVENUES FROM THE DDA. I'M SORRY. I THINK I HAVE A WINDOW THAT MIGHT BE OBSCURING SOME OF YOUR VIEW. THE PARKING REVENUES ARE EXPECTED TO BE OFF 30% THIS YEAR AND 55% NEXT YEAR AND THAT'S REFLECTING A LULL BEFORE IT COMES BACK. THE PARKING FINES ARE PROJECTED TO BE DOWN A THIRD BOTH YEARS. FIRE INSPECTION FEES ARE EXPECTED TO BE DOWN ALMOST 60% IN BOTH YEARS. THAT'S IN PART DUE TO SOME VACANCIES WE HAVE IN THE AREA. AND THEN THE CITY PARKS REVENUES HAS BEEN REALLY CHALLENGING, AND THIS IS STILL A LITTLE BIT DYNAMIC. WE EXPECT TO BE 30%, AS THE OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO COME ONLINE AND 34% NEXT YEAR. LAST YEAR THE STATE SHARED REVENUES WE HAVE ASSUMED TO BE DOWN JUST A TAD THIS YEAR IN OUR FISCAL YEAR, 3%, AND THEN DOWN 20% IN FISCAL '21. WHAT I DON'T HAVE ON HERE AND WHAT YOU WILL HEAR ABOUT IN A MOMENT, BECAUSE WE THOUGHT WE WOULD DO PUBLIC SERVICES FIRST THIS TIME IS OUR WATER AND SEWER ASSUMPTIONS ARE EXPECTED TO DROP OFF IN OUR PESSIMISTIC SCENARIO AND THAT'S WHAT ALL OF THIS IS, IS RIGHT THE LOWER END OF THE RANGE. IS -- I SHOULD SAY THE HIGHER END OF THE REVENUE SHORTFALL. OUR WATER AND SEWER ASSUMPTIONS WERE A 40% DROP THAT ASSUMES THE U OF M DOES NOT HAVE A FOOTBALL SEASON AND FULL ON CAMPUS ACTIVITIES DO NOT RETURN. AND THEN ON THE ACT 51 FUNDS, WE HAVE ASSUMED 1 TO 3% IMPACT THIS FISCAL YEAR AND A 20% IMPACT IN FISCAL '21. THE NUMBERS WE ARE PROVIDING IN THIS PRESENTATION, THEY ARE NOT DESIGNED TO TIE TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. WE ARE TAKING THE KEY ELEMENTS THAT ARE THE MOST DYNAMIC, CHANGING THE MOST, BASICALLY AND JUST FORECASTING THOSE REVENUES. WE HAVE ALSO EXCLUDED ANY IMPACT OF FEDERAL OR STATE AID. THOSE MAY BE COMING BUT WE DIDN'T THINK IT WAS RESPONSIBLE TO PUT THOSE IN YET. AT THIS TIME, IF MR. HUPY IS AVAILABLE, I WOULD ASK THAT HE AND MR. KHAN TOUCH BASE ON THE WATER SIDES AND I'M HAPPY TO TURN THE SLIDES AS YOU GO THROUGH THEM.
00:37:51.663: >>> THANK YOU, TOM. STARTING WITH THE WATER FUND, FOR THE TWO YEARS, 2020, THE SHORTFALL IS ESTIMATED TO BE JUST A LITTLE BIT OVER $2 MILLION AND IN 2021, $2.75 MILLION. HOW WE WILL DEAL WITH THAT AND THE ACTIVITIES THAT ARE GOING ON IN EACH OF THE FUNDS, THE WATER METER PROJECT OBVIOUSLY IS NOT GOING FORWARD. THAT REQUIRES US TO GO INTO PEOPLE'S HOMES TO CHANGE OUT THE METERS. IN THE COVID SITUATION, WE WILL NOT BE DOING THAT AND WE WILL BE DELAYING THAT PROJECT UNTIL SUCH TIME THAT WE COMFORTABLY CAN GO INTO THE HOMES AND CHANGE THE METERS. SO IN THAT FIRST YEAR, THAT IS ALMOST 2 MILLION AND $1.7 MILLION IN THE SECOND YEAR. THE ACID INJECTION SYSTEM, A LITTLE BACKGROUND ON THAT, IS WE USE A WATER TREATMENT PROCESS THAT USES CARBON DIOXIDE LIQUID TO ADJUST PH. CARBON DIOXIDE PRODUCTION IS AN OFFSHOOT OF ETHANOL PRODUCTION WHICH IS USED AS A GASOLINE ADDITIVE, WITH LESS MILES BEING DRIVEN, THE CARBON DIOXIDE MARKET IS TIGHTENING UP. AND SO WE ARE LOOKING AT DESIGNING -- OR WE HAVE DESIGNED AND LOOKING AT GETTING A PERMIT FROM DEQ TO USE ACID TO DO THE RECARBONNIZRECARBONNIZATION OF G WATER. THAT'S THE COST YOU SEE THERE, THE $250,000 TO SET IT UP AND THEN PROBABLY $100,000 TO RUN IT, IF WE HAVE TO RUN IT INTO THE SECOND YEAR. THE SEQUESTRATION OVERTIME, IF WE GO INTO SEQUESTRATION, WE HOLD PEOPLE IN THE PLANT TO KEEP THEM FROM BEING EXPOSED TO COVID. IT IS AI L A LITTLE OVER $100,0A YEAR. WE HAVEN'T GONE FULLY INTO THAT. SO WE AREN'T SEEING THAT EXPENSE YET. WE DELAYED OUR UV DISINFECTION PROCESS WHICH WAS A PROJECT STARTED PRECOVID, AND BY DELAYING IT, WE DID HAVE A -- LESS OF A SPEND IN FY '20, BUT WE WILL COME BACK IN FY '21, WE WILL HAVE THAT SPEND REAPPEAR AND A LITTLE BIT ADDITIONAL MORE BECAUSE WE ARE ACCELERATING IT BECAUSE IT HELPS US WITH THE ACID INJECTION SYSTEM. WE DID RECEIVE A GRANT FROM EGLE FOR OUR PFAS WORK. SO THAT IS UNEXPECTED REVENUE TO OFFSET IT. WE EXPECT A SAVINGS IN FY '21, IF THE WATER USAGE DOESN'T COME BACK. WE WILL HAVE USED LESS ELECTRICITY AND CHEMICALS. SO THAT WILL BE A SAVINGS. AND THAT'S ALSO IN THE NEXT LINE, THE ELECTRICAL SAVINGS. HIRING FREEZE WILL BE AROUND $100,000 EACH YEAR IF WE DON'T FILL VACANCIES. WE PLANT TO DELAY THE WATER TREATMENT FACILITIES MASTER PLAN WORK WE WERE GOING TO START THAT THIS YEAR. WE ARE DELAYING IT AND WE WILL START IT PROBABLY IN FY '22. -- YES, IN FY '22. THE BRO BROADWAY WATER MAIN PROT REPLACEMENT WHICH WAS TO HAPPEN IN FY '21 WILL ALSO BE DELAYED. SO THAT GETS US TO WHERE WE NEED TO BE IN THE WATER FUND ON A VERY BROAD, GENERAL OVERVIEW. TOM, NEXT SLIDE. IN THE SANITARY SEWER FUND, ROUGHLY 1.5 MILLION THIS YEAR AND 4.28 IN FY '21. THE METER PROJECT SAVINGS. ALTHOUGH THEY ARE WATER METERS THEY ARE PAID BY THE WATER AND THE SEWER FUND BECAUSE WE GENERATE THE SEWER BILLINGS OFF OF THOSE METERS ALSO. WE WILL DELAY LIFT STATION REHAB. WE HAD TWO LIFT STATIONS PLANNED, SEQUOIA ONE AND SEQUOIA TWO FOR FY '21. WE WOULD SLOW WALK THOSE. WE WOULD DELAY THE SOUTH SIDE INTERCEPTOR REHAB, WHICH WERE IN PHASE SIX OF THAT PROJECT. THAT WOULD BE $1.1 MILLION. SAVINGS, AGAIN, BECAUSE THERE'S LESS FLOW THROUGH THE PLANTS, ABOUT JUST SHY OF A HALF MILLION. ASSET MANAGEMENT GRANT PROCEEDS. THAT WE RECEIVED A GRANT TO DEVELOP OUR ASSET MANAGEMENT PLAN. SO THAT WAS A BONUS. RESTRICTING TRAVEL AND TRAINING IS A SMALL SAVINGS. PLANT ELECTRICAL SAVINGS, AGAIN, LESS FLOW, LESS ELECTRICITY. A HIRING FREEZE, WE'LL SAVE ABOUT 1 $100,000 IN N FY '21, SEQUESTRATION OVERTIME WOULD BE A LOSS OF ABOUT 110 AND THEN WE WOULD USE FUND BALANCE IN FY '21 TO BALANCE EVERYTHING OUT. SLIDE. IN THE MAJOR STREET FUNDS, THIS YEAR WE'RE LOOKING AT BEING $161,000 SHORT. OF THAT, THE HIRING FREEZE WOULD SAVE $90,000 AND WE HAVE NOT BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN THE TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING VACANCY. THAT'S 108. SO THAT COVERS IT FOR THIS YEAR. NEXT YEAR, WE WOULD DELAY THE BROADWAY BRIDGE REPAIR PROJECT FOR $1.6 MILLION. DELAY EQUIPMENT PURCHASES FOR $300,000, AND CONTINUE WITH A HIRING FREEZE. REDUCE ALTERNATIVE TRANSPORTATION FUNDING. NORMALLY WE TRANSFER 5% OF THE MAJOR STREET FUND TO THE ALT TRANSPORTATION FUND. THIS WOULD LOOK AT TRANSFERRING 2.5% TO THE ALT TRANSPORTATION FUND. OPERATIONS SAVINGS OF $38,000. THAT'S REALLY THE MONEY COMING BACK FROM THE SAVINGS FROM THE PREVIOUS YEAR, FROM 2020. TRAVEL AND TRAINING RESTRICTIONS WOULD BE $13,000 AND THAT GETS US TO THE $2 MILLION THAT WE NEED TO ACHIEVE. ON THE LOCAL STREET FUNDS, A MUCH ABBREVIATED LIST. WE WILL BE SHORT -- IN THE WORST CASE SCENARIO 61,000 THIS YEAR. THAT WOULD MOSTLY COME OUT OF REDUCED MAINTENANCE TO THE ROADWAYS. 7,000 ON A HIRING FREEZE AND IN 2021, IT WOULD BE $607,000 AND, AGAIN, THE BULK OF THAT WILL COME OUT OF REDUCED ROAD MAINTENANCE.
00:46:38.857: >> City Admin. Crawford: THANK YOU, CRAIG. SO I'M GOING TO DO THE GENERAL FUND AND I WANT TO PUT THIS IN CONTEXT AGAIN. WHAT WE'RE PROVIDING YOU IS A LIST OF ITEMS THAT IS NOT INTENTED TO BE -- INTENDED TO BE NECESSARILY ACTED UPON INITIAL LeBECAUSE SO MUCH OF '21 IS NOT YET KNOWN, OUR THOUGHT AT THIS POINT IS WE NEED TO SEE WHAT THINGS LOOK LIKE AS THE STATE STARTS TO REOPEN, AND WHAT TRACTION IT GETS AND DOESN'T GET AND ADJUST ACCORDINGLY. SO ALL OF THESE LISTS ARE BEING PROVIDED AS AN INITIAL SHOT OF WHAT THAT MIGHT LOOK LIKE TO WORK FROM. WHEN WE LOOK AT THE GENERAL FUND AND THE PESSIMISTIC SCENARIO, AGAIN, THIS IS 25% LOWER THAN IN '21. IT'S 25% LOWER THAN OUR MAIN LINE PROJECTION. THESE ARE JUST THE REVENUE CATEGORIES THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER. THE FIRST THREE COLUMNS REPRESENT '20, THE SECOND THREE BARS REPRESENT '21678 YOU WILL2. THE YELLOW BAR IS THE SHORTFALL, IT'S 4.8 AND 9.8 MILLION. WHEN I PUT THAT INTO A CHART, THIS IS A LITTLE BIT EASIER TO READ. WHAT WE HAVE DONE IS WE CATEGORIZED SOME RECOVERY ACTIONS IN THE GROUPS. I GOT THEM COLOR CODED SO AS WE GO THROUGH THE FOLLOWING SLIDES, YOU WILL BE ABLE TO TIE THEM BACK TO THIS. THE FIRST GROUP THAT WE CAME UP WITH, WERE CRISIS RELATED AND UNPLANNED SAVINGS. CLOSE ARE THE KIND OF THINGS THAT WE JUST HAVE TO SPEND ON. AND DISCRETIONARY, YOU KNOW, THE TRULY DISCRETIONARY ITEMS, THE CAPITAL PROJECTS YOU CONSIDER DELAYING CAPITAL PROJECTS, SOME OF WHICH ARE MORE ADJUSTABLE THAN OTHERS. A HARD PART ABOUT THAT IS THAT TO SOME EXTENT, GOVERNMENT PROJECTS CONTINUING PROVIDE SOME ECONOMIC STABILITY FOR YOUR COMMUNITY. SO IT'S A TWO-EDGED SWORD TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU CAN MOVE THEM GENERALLY GOVERNMENTS DO. THATTHAT'S PARTICULARLY CHALLENG IN THIS CRISIS. THE DEBT RELATED CRISIS. AND LABOR RELATED, THESE ARE ASSOCIATED WITH OUR WORKFORCE. THEN USE OF FUND BALANCE, GIVEN THE SHORT TENURE IN '20 TO DEAL WITH IT, THERE'S A PROJECTED NEED OF $1.5 MILLION THAT COMES OFF THE 16 MILLION THAT I REFERENCED IN EARLIER. IN ' '21, WE HAVE THE IDEAS IN E IDEATION STAGE THAT WOULD GET ALL OF THE 1.9 MILLION. THE FIRST FEW LINES ARE THE ITEMS ON THE LAST COUNCIL AGENDA AT THE LAST SESSION. THESE ARE MONTH ARE RECENTLY. THESE ARE ITEMS THAT YOU HAVE APPROVED TO HELP THE COMMUNITY RESPOND TO THE STRESS THAT THEY ARE FEELING. IN ADDITION TO THE ERR MECHANISMS THAT THE E -- THE OTR LAYERS OF GOVERNMENT ARE PROVIDING. THE ITEM FOR PARK TEMP EMPLOYEES. THIS IS A SAVINGS BECAUSE THE OPERATIONS ARE NOT OPENED UP. FOR '21, WE BELIEVE THERE WILL BE A COST IMPACT AS WHEN THEY DO OPEN UP, THEY WILL HAVE TO OPERATE WITH PROBABLY MORE STAFFING OR IN A DIFFERENT WAY GIVEN THE ADDITIONAL ATTENTION THAT HAS TO BE PAID RELATED TO THE COVID ACTIVITIES. THERE WAS A LEGAL SETTLEMENT, IT'S JUST TIMING OF THOSE PROCEEDS. AND THEN THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SHIFTING SOME OF OUR COSTS RELATED TO PLIED THAT WE HAD TO BUY RELATED TO COVID OUT OF OUR RISK FUND THAT. SAVES THE GENERAL FUND SOME MONIES AND ALLOWS US TO AGO REGREAT OUR FEMA-RELATED MONEY AND WE WOULD SAVE SOME MONEY ON PARKING TICKET PROCESSING FEES. ONE OF THE LARGEST EXPENDITURES IS THE M MASTER PLAN. THERE'S $500,000 IN THE BUDGET THAT HAS NOT BEEN EXPENDED. YOU HAVE A RECENT RESOLUTION FOR 300 SOMETHING THOUSAND TO ROUND OUT ALL OF THE REQUIREMENT AS AND DESIRES ON THAT PLAN. THIS ACTION HERE WOULD DEFER THAT PAST '21. SO YOU WOULD NOT INCUR THE ADDED SCOPE. THE CENTER OF THE CITY FUNDING, THERE WAS 148 THAT IS REMAINING IN FISCAL '20. THIS WAS ONLY 20 BUDGETED IN FISCAL '21, HOWEVER, GIVEN THE CONVERSATION FROM THE OTHER NIGHT WITH COUNCIL'S INTEREST WITH CONTINUING EFFORTS WITH CENTER OF THE CITY, I ADDED ANOTHER 20,000 HERE, FOR A TOTAL FUNDING OF 40,000 IN '21, IN ORDER TO ALLOW SOME OF THE STUDIES AND ENGAGEMENT OPPORTUNITIES TO DURR. OCCUR. ON THE TREE LINE TRAIL, THIS HAD $40,000. THAT WAS PERFECT PRIMARILY USED FOR STAFF SUPPORT. SO THAT WOULD PUT -- IF THIS WERE APPROVED OR MOVED FORWARD ON, IT WOULD BASICALLY NOT HAVE THE STAFF SUPPORT ON THAT PROJECT. FOR '21. SUSPENDING THE PARK RESOLUTION. THERE'S A LONG STANDING RESOLUTION THAT THE PARK SYSTEM AS FUNDED BY THE GENERAL FUND DOES NOT INCUR ANY REDUCTIONS GREATER THAN THE AVERAGE OF THE REST OF THE OTHER DEPARTMENTS. SO WHEN OTHER DEPARTMENTS GETS FUNDINGS, PARKS GET FUNDING EQUIVALENT TO THE OTHER DEPARTMENTS AS WELL. IT WAS OVER $300,000 IN FISCAL '20. TODAY 126 OF THAT HAD AS NOT BEEN EXPENDED. I BELIEVE THERE ARE SOME THOUGHTS AND IDEAS THAT ARE IN THE WORKS FOR UTILIZING THAT, BUT IF THIS CONTINUED THOSE EFFORTS THIS YEAR, THERE WOULD BE 126, AND THEN THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR'S BUDGET HAS $220,000 THAT IT WOULD IMPLY IT WOULD NEED TO BE FUNDED THROUGH THIS RESOLUTION. THIS IDEA OR THIS PROPOSAL IS TO SUSPEND THAT FOR THIS YEAR AND NEXT IN ORDER TO RETAIN THAT FUNDING IN THE GENERAL FUND. CRASH MAPPING SOFTWARE IS SOME SOFTWARE WE WOULD ACTUALLY FIND FROM FORFEITURE FUNDS OR -- I BELIEVE IT'S FORFEITURE OR IT. AND ENERGY AUDIT. WE WOULD JUST DELAY THAT. THERE'S NOT THE STAFF TO DO THOSE RIGHT NOW. SO THAT WOULD BE A LATER DATE. THE DEER CULL HAS BEEN A PROGRAM THAT HAS MET MANY OF ITS METRICS, HOWEVER, COUNCIL COULD CONSIDER TAKING A YEAR OFF ON THAT AND THAT'S WHAT THIS SHOWS IN FISCAL '21 AS A TOTAL OF $140,000 IN THAT BUDGET FOR THAT. THERE'S $25,000 OF OUTSIDE LEGAL SERVICES THAT WAS REQUESTED AS AN INCREASE IN '21. THIS WAS PROPOSED TO NOT INCLUDE THAT, AND THEN THE HISTORIC DISTRICT SURVEY, WHICH IS NEEDED FOR SOME COMPLIANCE COULD BE DELAYED. IT'S NOT AN ABSOLUTE NECESSARY TO DO. -- NECESSITY TO DO. ON THE CAPITAL PROJECTS, THIS SECTION -- THESE ARE THE MANY THINGS THAT YOU BASICALLY HAD INCLUDED IN THE RECOMMENDED BUDGET. IT WAS THE HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD PROJECT IS THE PAVING OF HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD AND IT HAS THE SUPPORT OF THE PARTIES OPEN THE STREET, HOWEVER, IT'S A SIZABLE AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR THE CITY TO INCUR. SO THAT COULD BE DEFERRED. THE ANN ARBOR SALINE PROJECT. SOME OF THE PARTNERS ARE NOT MOVING FORWARD THIS, AND IT WOULD NOT MAKE SENSE FOR THE CITY TO CONTINUE IN OUR VIEW. YOU MAY RECALL THAT THE CITY, WE HAVE GOT A POLICY FOR TRANSFERRING MONIES TO A CAPITAL SINKING FUND. THIS IS REALLY UTILIZED TO KEEP THE MAINTENANCE ON OUR FACILITIES WHERE THEY SHOULD BE. THIS IS, YOU KNOW, AC UNITS. IT'S ALL THE EQUIPMENT AND IT MIGHT BE PAINTING OR IN THOSE KIND OF THINGS. WE HAVE $400,000 WE HAVE PUT IN. REMOVING THAT RETRANSFER BUT NOT CHANGING THAT POLICY, IT'S AI PROPOSAL FOR '21. SIMILARLY, THE STREETLIGHT REPLACEMENTS. STREETLIGHTS ARE AN ASSET TO DEGRADE OVER TIME IN THE STREET. WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET FUNDING -- WE HAVE IDENTIFIED THROUGH MODELING, WE REQUIRE $535,000 SET ASIDE. BOTH OF THESE ITEMS, THESE LAST TWO ITEMS ARE THINGS WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GROW INTO AS RESOURCES WERE AVAILABLE. THIS IS A PROPOSAL TO TAKE THE $425,000 AND NOT FUND IT. THAT IS CHALLENGING PERSPECTIVE THAT THE STREETLIGHTS WILL CONTINUE TO AGE. THE RESIDENT DRIVEN SIDEWALK GAP PROGRAM HAS ABOUT $147,000 LEFT IN FISCAL '20 AND THERE'S A BUDGET OF $100,000. THAT WOULD BE FUNDS TO BE RETAINED IN THE GENERAL FUND. AND IF THE UNIVERSITY DOESN'T COME BACK TO SESSION ON CAMPUS, THE SATELLITE OFFICE MAY NOT BE REQUIRED. THAT'S THE $25,000. FOR THE DEBT-RELATED ISSUES, IT'S PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE RETIREMENT BENEFITS. YOU MAY RECALL THAT YOUR FUNDING POLICY FOR THE RETIRED HEALTH CARE MOVES UP AT 2% PER YEAR, OR -- OR THE AMOUNT OF INCREASE IN REVENUES. THIS IS -- WHAT THIS WOULD PROPOSE IS TO NOT FUND THE EXCESS ORGANIZATION THAT HAS BEEN GOING INTO THE VEBA. YOU MAY RECALL THAT OUR VEBA TRUST FUND HAS BEEN INCREASING TOWARDS ITS GOAL OF 100%. I BELIEVE WE ARE AROUND 72, IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY. THAT HAPPENS BECAUSE WE DO MAKE THESE CONTRIBUTIONS. THE PARTICULAR CHALLENGE ON THIS ONE, JUST SO YOU UNDERSTAND IT, IF WE DO NOT MAKE THESE -- THE E CONTRIBUTIONS THAT THE CITY MAKES IN TOTAL IS ROUGHLY THE SIZE OF THE CLAIMS THAT THE CITY INCURS. THE CITY IS SELF-INSURED AND SO AS THESE CLAIMS COME IN, WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PAY THEM OUT OF THE PLANNED CONTRIBUTIONS. WE HAVE NOT HAD TO TAB THE VEBA TRUST FUNDS FOR ANY CLAIMS TO DATE. IF WE DO REMOVE THE SUPPLEMENTAL CONTRIBUTIONS, WE WOULD HAVE TO START TAPPING INTO THE TRUST FUND DEFINITELY BY '21 IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT CLAIMS WERE PAID. THAT IS WHAT IT'S DESIGNED TO DO. WE JUST WEREN'T PLANNING TO DO THAT THIS EARLY IN THE PROCESS. THAT'S ONE FRUSTRATING FACTOR ABOUT THAT. ANOTHER IS THAT THIS IS THE TIME THAT YOU ACTUALLY -- [ NO AUDIO ] WHEN IT'S HIGHER SO DISCONTINUING CONTRIBUTIONS NOW MAY END UP COSTING YOU MORE LATER BECAUSE YOU MIGHT BE MAKING DISTRIBUTIONS AT A TIME WHEN YOU ARE NOT HAVING THE BENEFIT OF THE EARNINGS FROM THESE CONTRIBUTIONS. THE STORY IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE PENSION BUT ON A MUCH SMALLER SCALE. THERE'S ONLY BEEN ABOUT $500,000 OF EXCESS CONTRIBUTIONS AND THOSE ARE REALLY JUST PUT IN THROUGH THE BUDGET IN THE LAST -- IN THIS YEAR AND NEXT. WE LOOKED AT WHETHER OR NOT THERE WERE OTHER DEBT-RELATED ACTIONS THAT WE COULD DO, BUT MR. HORNING HAS BEEN REFINANCING ALL OF THE CITY DEBT THAT HE COULD OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS AS RATES HAVE BEEN LOW, AND WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO IDENTIFY ANY DEBTS PARTICULARLY RELATED TO THE GENERAL FUND THAT EVEN IN THE LOWER RATES WE COULD REFINANCE IN AN APPROPRIATE WAY. ON A LABOR-RELATED ITEMS, THE FIRST ONE IS HIRING FREEZE. AND WHEN I SAY HIRING FREEZE, THE CONCEPT HERE IS THAT THERE'S ALWAYS -- WHEN YOU ARE MANAGING THE WORKFORCE, THERE ARE -- THERE ARE SKILLS AND POSITIONS THAT NEED TO BE FILLED, KIND OF FOR THE SITUATION THAT YOU ARE IN, OR THE SITUATION THAT YOU SEE COMING AND SO EVEN THOUGH THERE'S A HIRING FREEZE, I WOULD CALL IT MAYBE A SELECTED HIRING FREEZE WHEREBY DEFAULT POSITIONS ARE NOT GOING TO BE HIRED AND THEN BY EXCEPTION, THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR WOULD APPROVE SOME. SO I HAVE BEEN THROUGH ALL OF THE VACANCIES NOW, THE PROPOSED HIRINGS AND GOT IT DOWN TO ABOUT 10 THAT WE WOULD PROBABLY BE HIRING NOW OR CONTINUE TO MAKE EFFORTS ON. ONE OF THEM, FOR EXAMPLE, WOULD BE THE HR DIRECTOR POSITION. THE NEXT LINE YOU HAVE SEEN ON A NUMBER OF OTHER SLIDES IS TRAVEL AND TRAINING RESTRICTIONS. THOSE ARE IN PLACE, HOWEVER, I WOULD POINT OUT THAT WE WILL HAVE SOME TRAINING EXPENDITURES AS SOME OF OUR EMPLOYEES HAVE LICENSES THAT REQUIRE ONGOING CREDITS TO MAINTAIN THEIR LICENSE AND THEIR ABILITY TO PRACTICE AND BEST FORM. THE THIRD LINE IS THE OVERHIRE PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE USED KIND OF SUCCESSFULLY OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS. THIS CUTS IT IN HALF. THERE IS STILL A NEED FOR OVERHIRE PROGRAM, BUT I THINK IT'S CUTTING IT A LITTLE TIGHT BUT YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING. THIS IS PUTTING A STRESS INTO THE SYSTEM AS NOT HAVING AN OVERHIRE PROCESS. THE NEXT LINE HAS THREE POSITIONS, THE SUSTAINABILITY FELLOW, THE PLANNING INTERN AND FACILITIES TEMP, THEY WOULD ALL BE NOT FILLED THROUGH FISCAL '21. THERE HAVE BEEN SOME REDUCED OVERTIME FROM OUR CHANGE IN OPERATING DEPLOYMENTS. WE WOULD CONTINUE THAT THROUGH '21. WE HAVE $97,000 IN THE RECOMMENDED BUDGET FOR INCLUSION TRAINING. OUR RECOMMENDATION HERE IS TO LEAVE 25,000 IN, AND LET THAT BE THE SUPPORT FOR STAFF TO PICK UP THIS EFFORT AT THIS TIME. THERE'S A LOT OF IMPORTANT WORK TO DO IN THIS AREA, TO MAINTAIN A STRONG WORKFORCE IN CULTURE, AND I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS APPROPRIATE TO REMOVE ALL OF IT. SO THIS LEAVES 25,000 IN FOR THAT. VOLUNTARY FURLOUGHS IS SOMETHING THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT. CONCEPTUALLY, THIS IS WHERE EMPLOYEES MAY WORK LESS TIME, 15 FORT15% OF THE TIME OR 50% OF TE TIME. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF TBDs OR A COUPLE OF THEM. AND WE HAVE SOME THOUGHTS AROUND IT, BUT NOT A PLAN. THE INCENTIVE FOR STAFF REDUCTIONS, THIS IS A NEGATIVE TBD. I DON'T HAVE ANY THOUGHTS OR PLANS ON THIS NOW AND THE REASON IS WHEN WE THOUGHT ABOUT STAFF REDUCTIONS AND INCENTIVES FOR STAFF REDUCTIONS PREVIOUSLY, WE WERE A LARGER ORGANIZATION AND NOT AS LEAN AS WE ARE NOW. AND THE INCENTIVE PROGRAM WORKS IN A BROADWAY. YOU MAKE ONE PLAN AND IT'S PROVIDED TO THE FULL GROUP OF EMPLOYEES AND INDIVIDUALLY CHOOSE TO TAKE IT OR NOT. AS AI LEANER ORGANIZATION, THAT'S MUCH MORE CHALLENGING TO MANAGE BECAUSE YOU CAN ONLY AFFORD TO HAVE PEOPLE LEAVE IN CERTAIN AREAS AND CERTAIN QUANTITIES AND STILL DELIVER YOUR OPERATIONS. SO I PUT IT ON THE LIST AS AN OPTION, ALTHOUGH, I'M NOT QUITE SURE THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO DO -- I DIDN'T WANT TO PUT ANY MONIES IN HERE. I'M NOT SURE THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO DEVELOP ONE THAT WOULD BE EFFECTIVE FOR US FROM A WORKFORCE MANA MANA MANAGEMENT PERSPECTIVE. WE HAVE USED IT IN THE PAST, AND SO IT'S SOMETHING ON THE TABLE. THE NEXT ONE IS SENIOR MANAGEMENT, VOLUNTARY NONPERMANENT PAY CUTS THIS IS -- DIRECTIONALLY, IT'S A 10% PAY CUT FOR MYSELF AND 5% FOR MR. POSTEMA AND SERVICE AREA ADMINISTRATORS. WE WOULD WANT TO DO THAT AS DEMONSTRATING OUR LEADERSHIP PRIOR TO OUR EMPLOYEES BEING ADVERSELY IMPACTED IN A MATERIAL WAY. FROM A PAY FREEZE IS THE NEXT ONE, THIS IS ALL OF OUR EMPLOYEES NOT UNDER CONTRACT, BASICALLY NOT GETTING A RAISE IN THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR. THE DEPARTMENTAL RESTRUCTURING, WELL, I DON'T HAVE ANY PLANS FOR THAT NOW. THAT AS A LONGER TERM EFFORT THAT YOU WORK ON. I DO BELIEVE FROM MY EXPERIENCE WE COULD FIND SOME SAVINGS THERE. I DON'T HAVE A PARTICULAR PLAN IDENTIFIED AT THIS TIME, BUT I'M COMFORTABLE ENOUGH WITH IT, THAT I WOULD PUT $300,000 IN. ONLY THE INVOLUNTARY FURLOUGHS, LAYOFFS, AND/OR PAY REDUCTIONS, THIS HAS EQUATED TO ABOUT -- THE REDUCTION OF ABOUT 25 EMPLOYEES FOR ABOUT A 5% ACROSS THE BOARD PAY REDUCTION. AND THIS IS ALL DONE ON THE GENERAL FUND EMPLOYEES, JUST FOR PERSPECTIVE, SINCE THIS IS THE GENERAL FUND. THIS IS WHERE MOST OF OUR ACTIVITIES ARE, AND WHERE WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR REVENUE SHORTFALLS, WHERE A LOT OF THE DIFFICULTY IS. ALL OF THESE -- YOU KNOW, ALL OF THESE ARE CHALLENGING ALL OF THESE, NOT JUST WORKFORCE, THEY ARE ALL CHALLENGING THINGS TO DEAL WITH ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. LASTLY WE HAVE USE THE RESERVES AND ON THIS SLIDE, I INDICATED EARLIER THAT THE $1.5 MILLION IS NECESSARY TO GET FISCAL '20 DONE. WE WOULD BE DOWN TO ABOUT 15% OF YOUR POLICY MINIMUM ON THE GENERAL FUND, ON THE UNASSIGNED BALANCE. I WOULD LOOK TO NOT DO THAT IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO GET THAT THERE. WE HAVE FUND BALANCE FOUR TIMES LIKE THIS AND DEPENDING ON HOW THINGS GO, WE MAY NEED IT IN '21 OR '22. YOU KNOW, FROM MY SEAT, AS IT IS, WE CAN SPEND SOME, BUT NOT A LOT, AND AS WE GO THROUGH TOUGH SITUATIONS LIKE WE ARE IN. THIS OTHER LINE, IT TRANSFERS FROM OTHER FUNDS. THIS MIGHT BE THE RISK FUND TO THE EXTENT THERE'S SOME EXCESS RESERVES IF WE IDENTIFY ANY. THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH MILLAGE, THINGS LIKE THAT, WE COULD LOOK AT THOSE, BUT, AGAIN, I HAD NOT PLANNED ON ANY OF THOSE. THIS IS THE SUMMARY SLIDE THAT YOU SAW EARLIER AGAIN, I WANTED TO BRING IT BACK IN THE FULL PICTURE. BASICALLY IF WE GOT TO THE POINT THAT WE THINK WE ARE PRETTY CLOSE TO HITTING THIS IN FISCAL '20 OF A $4.8 MILLION LOSS, WE HAVE A WAY TO GET THERE. THIS -- IN ORDER FOR US TO EXECUTE THIS, WE WOULD HAVE TO COME BACK TO YOU WITH SOME RESOLUTIONS, IMPLEMENTING THE POLICY WAIVERS FOR PARTICULARLY THE DEBT-RELATED THINGS, AND FOR FISCAL '21, YOU KNOW, THERE'S ENOUGH TO GET THERE, BUT I WOULD SAY THERE'S STILL MORE WORK WE WANT TO DO. THOSE ARE QUITE PAINFUL ACTIONS THAT WE LISTED AND, AGAIN, IT TAKES A LOT OF FUNDING -- THERE'S A LOT COMING FROM THE EMPLOYEE BASE AND THE DEBT RESTRUCTURING. SO WHAT DO WE DO? HOW DO WE MOVE FORWARD WHEN WE ARE FACING THIS ENVIRONMENT? YOU KNOW, THERE'S THREE THINGS IN MY VIEW. ONE IS WE HAVE GOT TO COMMUNICATE. WE WANT TO COMMUNICATE WITH YOU AND KEEP YOU UPDATED ON HOW THINGS ARE GOING. WHEN WE COMMUNICATE, WE HAVE TO KNOW WHERE WE ARE HEADED. WE HAVE TO HAVE A DIRECTION, A NORTH STAR FROM WHERE WE ARE GOING. AND FROM MY VIEW, THAT'S THE MISSION STATEMENT. THE MISSION STATEMENT IS TO DELIVER EXCEPTIONAL SERVICE THAT ENHANCE AND SUSTAIN A VIBRANT CITY. HOW I VIEW THAT AS BEING IMPLEMENTED IS AS WE MAKE TOUGH CHOICES WE DO IT IN THE CONTEXT THAT WE DON'T OVERLY JEOPARDIZE OUR MISSION. ANYTHING THAT'S NOT MISSION-DRIVEN, EVEN IF IT IS MISSION DRIVEN, CAN WE DO IT BETTER BUT THINGS THAT AREN'T MISSION DRIVEN ARE THE THINGS THAT ARE PROBABLY THE AREAS WE LOOK AT THE MOST. AS WE MAKE TOUGH DECISIONS, THE REALITY IS WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF FLUFF IN OUR BUDGET, AND THERE ARE A LOT OF TOUGH DECISIONS TO BE MADE. AND SO SOME OF THE COMPETING THINGS WE WOULD CONSIDER IS HOW DO WE DELIVER OUR ESSENTIAL SERVICES IN THE MOST EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE WAY. THIS IS THE CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT KIND OF CONCEPT. WE FEEL LIKE WE DO THAT A LOT BUT THESE ARE TIMES THAT YOU HAVE TO BUCKLE DOWN AND FIND MORE. WE WOULD BE LOOKING FOR THESE OPPORTUNITIES EVEN MORE AGGRESSIVELY. HOW DO WE MAINTAIN A HEALTHY AND MOTIVATED WORKFORCE? WE GO THROUGH TIMES LIKE THIS, BUT THE WORKFORCE GETS THE WORK DONE. WE PRIMARILY HAVE OUR EMPLOYEES AS AN ASSET TO DELIVER SERVICES AND WE NEED TO HAVE A HEALTHY AND MOTIVATED WORKFORCE TO DO A GOOD JOB FOR THE COMMUNITY. DURING ALL OF THIS, WE NEED TO MAINTAIN THE LONG-TERM SUSTAINABILITY, NOT JUST STRUCTURALLY, BUT HAVING MONEY SET ASIDE FOR REPLACEMENTS AND HAVE A GOOD DEBT RATING -- CREDIT RATING, THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. AND LASTLY, WE CAN'T FORGET THE MOST VULNERABLE AND HOW THEY WOULD BE DISADVANTAGED AND WE NEED TO EVALUATE OUR POLICY IMPLICATIONS AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE EQUITABLE. AS WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS, THIS IS A VERY COMPRESSED TIME FRAME. YOU KNOW, IT HAS TENDED TO BE, I WILL HAVE TO SAY BEFORE I GO THROUGH THE SLIDE, EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS PANDEMIC HAS SURPRISED ME BECAUSE AS WE START TO WALK INTO AN EVENT, WE END UP AT THE VERY WORST CASE SCENARIO IT SEEMS LIKE AS WE WENT THROUGH THIS THE FIRST WEEKS HAS JUST -- IT WAS A CONSTANT CHURN OF, WELL, GEEZ IT COULD GET THIS BAD AND THE NEXT DAY IT WAS THAT BAD AND THEN THE NEXT DAY. SO I SAY THAT NOT TO SAY WE ARE GOING TO BE AT THE WORST CASE SCENARIO, BUT I DO THINK THE WORST CASE SCENARIO IS A POSSIBILITY. YOU KNOW, I DO SEE A LOT OF IMPROVEMENTS OCCURRING. I DO THINK THERE'S ROOM FOR OPTIMISM, BUT NEVERTHELESS, EVEN OUR MAIN LINE SCENARIO IS A VERY CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT. SO, YEAH, BASICALLY $92 MILLION BASELINE OF AN OPERATING BUDGET, AND YOU ELIMINATE THE PASS THROUGHS AND WE ARE TALKING ABOUT PRETTY MUCH A -- A RISK OF A 9 TO 10%, THAT'S MAJOR. AS WE GO FORWARD FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS. NEXT MONDAY IS OUR COUNCIL MEETING TO ADOPT -- WHERE YOU CONSIDER ADOPTION OF THE BUDGET. THE BUDGET DOES NOT INCLUDE THE PANDEMIC, AS I HAVE MENTIONED HERE BRIEFLY. HAVING A FRAMEWORK FOR HOW WE APPROACH DECISIONS AND HOW WE LOOK AT WHAT IS ACTUALLY GOING TO HAPPEN. WHAT WE DON'T WANT TO DO IS OVERREACT AND POTENTIALLY TAKE TOO MUCH OUT AND TO THE POINT THAT IT MIGHT JEOPARDIZE THE GOOD ENOUGH THAT WE ARE DOING. AND THEN WE HAVE GONE THROUGH THESE ACTIONS. COUNCIL'S ROLE THEN IS TO -- WE HAVE BUDGET AMENDMENTS THAT ARE COMING UP THAT REALLY DO -- IF YOU HAVE ANY THIS WEDNESDAY, WE ARE GOING TO WORK WITH YOU, WITH BEST EFFORTS AS LATE AS YOU GIVE THEM TO US, BUT WE ALSO RECOGNIZE YOU MIGHT HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT TONIGHT'S PRESENTATION AND WE WILL TRY TO ANSWER THOSE AS WELL. IT WILL BE A BUSY WEEK AND WE HAVE THE STANDARD PEOPLE TO CONTACT AS YOU GO THROUGH THAT SARA HIGGINS FOR THE QUESTIONS AND THEN MATT HORNING AND KIM BUSELMEIER FOR THE BUDGET AMENDMENTS. WITH THAT WE ARE OPEN FOR QUESTIONS. I'M GOING TO TAKE THE SCREEN SHARE OFF. I'M HAPPY TO BRING IT BACK ON IF PEOPLE HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT A PARTICULAR SLIDE.
01:11:31.848: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
01:11:34.351: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU. FIRST OF ALL, I WOULD LIKE TO THANK MR. CRAWFORD AND YOUR TEAM AND THE CITY STAFF, MR. HUPY AND EVERYONE WHO HAVE BEEN PULLING TOGETHER, MR. HORNING. THERE'S SO MANY OF YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS. I SEE YOU ON THE SCREEN HERE. THANK YOU ALL, ALL THE SAAs, MS. PRASCHAN. YOU HAVE BEEN WORKING FEVERISHLY. THANK YOU FOR PUTTING TOGETHER THIS ECONOMIC RECOVERY PLAN BEFORE TONIGHT'S MEETING SO WE HAD TIME TO DIGEST IT. MY TAKE IS THAT ONE THING THAT'S CLEAR AT THIS POINT IS THAT THE CITY CLEARLY FACES SIGNIFICANT BUT UNCERTAIN FINANCIAL CHALLENGES DUE TO THE PANDEMIC. THE PROPOSED BUDGET, THE '21 BUDGET PRESENTED A MONTH AGO AND THIS IS OBVIOUSLY THROUGH NO FAULT OF STAFF OR ANYONE, IS NOW OUTDATED, AND I -- I DON'T FEEL IT VIABLE, AGAIN, THROUGH NO FAULT OF ANYONE. IT DOES HAVE EXPENDITURE LEVELS IN THE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ABOVE THE REVENUES TO SUPPORT THEM. CLEARLY WE ARE IN UNCHARTERED WATERS. THE CLOCK IS STICKING ON APPROVING A BUDGET. WE WILL BE VOTING ON THE BUDGET ONE WEEK FROM TONIGHT. AND WHAT WE HAVE BEFORE US IS A -- IS THE DETAILED BUDGET THAT WAS APPROPRIATELY BALANCED, WHEN IT WAS PRESENTED A MONTH AGO BUT NOW IT'S JUST NOT VIABLE WITH THE DEFICITS IN THE MILLIONS. AND YOU HAVE GIVEN US AN EXCELLENT FINANCIAL PLAN FRAMEWORK THAT IS A VERY HELPFUL FRAMEWORK, BUT IT'S NOT THE REVISED BUDGET PROPOSAL. I DID SEND YOU A MEMO THIS MORNING WITH MY THOUGHTS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW I BELIEVE WE COULD PROCEED, AND I --EN I DO KNOW FROM THAT MEMO, I SENT, I THINK, THE BEST APPROACH IS COUNCIL TO APPROVE A RESOLUTION RELATED TO THE BUDGET AND THE RECOVERY PLAN THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE PROPOSED APRIL BUDGE THAT THE WE RECEIVED FROM MR. CRAWFORD AND IT WOULD ADDRESS RECOVERY -- RECOVERY ACTION PLANS AND HELP BY OUTLINING SOME OF COUNCIL'S EXPECTATIONS AND PRINCIPLES IF YOU WILL, REGARDING THE RECOVERY PLANS, IMPLEMENTATION AND OBJECTIVES. AND I DO THINK THAT THAT HELPS THAT KIND OF APPROACH RECOGNIZES THE -- THE PRACTICAL REALITIES THAT WE'RE FACING, AND BUILT ON THE WORK THAT -- THE EXCELLENT WORK THAT STAFF HAS DONE IN DEVELOPING THE PLAN WE JUST PRESENTED. AND ALSO HELPS PROVIDE THE COUNCIL POLICY DIRECTION THAT'S NEEDED TO NAVIGATE ALL OF THIS. IN TALKING TO -- OR HAVING SOME COMMUNICATIONS WITH MR. CRAWFORD TODAY, HE PROVIDED SOME SUGGESTIONS ON THE -- RELATED TO FLEXIBILITY FOR STAFF, AND I WILL INCORPORATE THAT, MR. CRAWFORD AND ALL. AND I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK FOR MMR. CRAWFORD BUT MY SENSE IS THAT HE SUPPORTS THE APPROACH OF COUNCIL POLICY DIRECTION ON THIS. SO YOU KNOW WHAT, I WANT TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF A HEADS UP, WHAT WOULD BE COVERED IN THAT RESOLUTION. I CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE THERE WOULDN'T BE CONSENSUS ON THE ITEMS BUT, AGAIN, WANTED TO GIVE YOU A BIT OF A HEADS UP AND I KNOW WE WILL BE DEBATING SPECIFIC ITEMS. ANYWAY, I'M HOPEFUL THAT GIVING THIS KIND OF POLICY LEVEL GUIDANCE ON A RECOVERY PLAN IS A REASONABLE WAY FORWARD, BECAUSE I REALLY DON'T THINK THAT FOR US TO SIMPLY APPROVE AN UNBALANCED, UNVIABLE BUDGET WITHOUT ANY DIRECTION ON THE RECOVERY PLAN MAKES ANY SENSE OR IS HELPFUL FOR THAT MATTER. SO JUST WANTED TO GET THAT OUT THERE. THE OTHER THING I WANTED TO MENTION IS THAT THE WASHTENAW COUNTY COVID-19 LOCAL BUSINESS IMPACT SURVEY, I THINK IS CRITICAL IN THE SENSE THAT IT COULD HELP THE RESULTS FROM THAT SURVEY COULD HELP GUIDE SOME OF OUR DECISIONS ON INVESTMENT, SUPPORT, AND COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI IS AN EXCELLENT SPOKESPERSON AT THIS TABLE FOR THAT CONSTITUENCY. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE UNDERSTAND THE CHALLENGES TO OUR LOCAL BUSINESSES. AND FOR FOLKS OUT THERE YOU CAN ACCESS THIS LOCAL BUSINESS SURVEY. APPARENTLY IT DOESN'T TAKE LONG TO DO. BY -- IT'S BEING DONE BY A LOCAL RESEARCH INSTITUTION BY ENTRY POINT. IF YOU GOOGLE ENTRY POINT AND ALSO SPARK IS PUSHING IT OUT IN THE COMMUNITY. SO THERE IS A SPARK BLOG. I WOULD ENCOURAGE OUR LOCAL BUSINESSES TO WEIGH IN ON THAT. I HAVE A COUPLE OF DDA QUESTIONS IF I MAY. I DON'T KNOW IF MS. PAULY IS -- SHE'S PROBABLY NOT. I CAN SEE YOU SHAKING YOUR HEAD NO. SO I WILL SEND IN SOME QUESTIONS ON THE BUDGET, BECAUSE I DID SEND IN A QUESTION ABOUT THAT AND -- SO WE HAVE JUST GOTTEN THIS DETAILED FINANCIAL RECOVERY PLAN FROM SIT, BUT I'M BASICALLY WONDERING IF A SIMILAR FRAMEWORK EXISTS FOR THE DDA.
01:17:19.228: >> City Admin. Crawford: THE DDA HAS BEEN -- I CAN SHARE -- I HAVEN'T BEEN TO THEIR FINANCE COMMITTEE. I HAD MY FIRST BOARD MEETING THE OTHER DAY. THEY HAVE BEEN GIVING FORECASTS AND THEY REVIEWED WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE AND THEY HAVE BEEN DEVELOPING PLANS. THE -- THE LEVEL OF ACTIVITY THEY DO. SO MUCH OF WHAT THEY DO IS MAINTAINING THAT, YOU KNOW, IT'S -- ON THE PARKING SIDE IS MAINTAINING THE DECKS. THAT'S WHERE THE REAL MONEY IS THE OPERATIONS AND THE CAPITAL AND THE OPERATIONS STOPPED ALONG WITH THE REVENUES. AND THEN ON THE TIF OR THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT SIDE, YOU KNOW, HE THIS HAVE -- I'M TRYING TO REMEMBER -- I'M NOT REMEMBERING OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD WHAT THAT DISCUSSION WAS, BUT THEY HAVE BEEN THINKING THROUGH THEIR BUDGET SIMILARLY. THANKS. IF YOU COULD THEN, LATER ON, MR. CRAWFORD AND PASS THIS ALONG TO MS. PAULY, ON THE RECOVERY OR THE PROJECTIONS, IF THOSE COULD BE SHARED, I THINK THAT WOULD BE REHELPFUL. WHAT WE HAVE SEEN SO FAR -- WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL. WHAT WE HAVE SEEN SO FAR, THE DDA'S COVID-19 IMPACTS ARE FAR MORE SIGNIFICANT ON A PERCENTAGE BASIS THAN THE CITY'S. AND, YOU KNOW, GIVEN THEIR REVENUE HITS THAT THEY ARE PROJECTING. SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HIT IS FOR '20. BUT IN A RESPONSE TO A QUESTION, THEY INDICATED TO BUDGET ADJUSTMENTS WERE NECESSARY. SO, AGAIN, ANY RECOVERY PROJECTIONS OR PLANS, IF IT WOULD BE CLEARED WITH COUNCIL, I THINK THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL.
01:19:10.673: >> City Admin. Crawford: AS YOU SAY THAT, THEY ARE WORKING ON THOSE NOW AND I THINK THEY ARE ABOUT TWO WEEKS AWAY IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY ON HAVING THEIR RECOVERY EFFORTS PRESENTED TO THEIR GROUP.
01:19:19.882: >> Councilmember Lumm: GREAT. THANKS. A QUICK QUESTION ABOUT THE LDFA. WHAT FLEXIBILITY DO THEY HAVE THROUGH THEIR MEDC TO PROVIDE SMALL BUSINESS SUPPORT OR SERVICES DIRECTLY THROUGH SPARK?
01:19:36.532: >> City Admin. Crawford: THEY ARE PROHIBITED FROM DIRECTLY PROVIDING ANY SUPPORT TO A COMPANY. THAT IS AN EXPLICIT LIMITATION THAT THEY. HAVE THEY ARE ABLE TO WORK THROUGH SPARK FOR THE PERMISSIVE LEVELS OF ACTIVITIES. IT'S GENERALLY A HIGHLY RESTRICTED SOURCE OF FUNDS. ANYTHING WE DO, WE RUN BY THE MEDC TO ENSURE THAT THEY DEEM IT ACCEPTABLE.
01:20:14.170: >> Councilmember Lumm: OKAY. THANK YOU WILL.
01:20:18.241: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCIL WOMAN GRISWOLD.
01:20:20.776: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I CAN'T EMPHASIZE ENOUGH THAT WE ARE IN A FINANCIAL CRISIS. AND THIS PRESENTATION GAVE ME SOME CONFIDENCE THAT WE ARE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. I DID HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS. WE TALKED ABOUT THE WATER FUND AND ALSO THE SANITARY SEWER FUND AND HAVING A HIRING FREEZE. AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ANY HIRING FREEZE WOULD NOT NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE QUALITY OF THOSE SERVICES.
01:20:52.441: >> THE HIRING FREEZE THAT WE WOULD BE LOOKING AT WOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE THE DIRECT OPERATIONAL FOLKS. IT MIGHT BE ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT, ACTIVITIES LIKE THAT. SOME OF IT IS NOT OUT IN THE PLANTS BUT DOING THE COLLECTION AND THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS AND IT WOULD BE, SAY, A CREW THAT IS NORMALLY, SAY FOR SAKE OF ARGUMENT, 15 FOLKS THAT MIGHT BE RUNNING AT A CREW OF 14 FOLKS OR 13 FOLKS. AND THAT WOULD BE THE FOLKS THAT ARE DOING MAINTENANCE ON THE SYSTEMS OUT UNDER THE STREETS.
01:21:38.788: >> Councilmember Griswold: OH, OKAY. THANKS. I SENT AN EMAIL IN TODAY TO TOM CRAWFORD AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE PROTECT OUR CORE ESSENTIAL SERVICES AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. AND THEN I SEE UNDER CRASH MAPPING, THERE'S SOME SAVINGS AND THAT IS FROM NOT USING THE SOFTWARE ANY MORE? IS THAT --
01:22:11.754: >> City Admin. Crawford: NO, IT CAME FROM THE FORFEITURE. WE ARE STILL DOING IT. WE ARE JUSTING IT FROM ANOTHER SOURCE. IT'S EITHER FROM FORFEITURE FUNDS OR ANOTHER SOURCE. IT'S JUST NOT A GENERAL FUND OBLIGATION.
01:22:22.298: >> IT IS FORFEITURE.
01:22:24.200: >> Councilmember Griswold: FORFEITURE. OKAY. AND I WOULD JUST SAY AND I SAID THIS BEFORE, THAT WE NEED TO COLLABORATE MORE WITH OUR OTHER ENTITIES SUCH AS SAM COGG, THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN TO SEE WHERE THERE MIGHT BE SOME SAVINGS. ONE THING THAT WAS NOT MENTIONED WAS THE LOWER TOWN TRAFFIC STUDY. HAS THAT -- THE CONSULTANT FOR THAT BEEN -- THAT CONTRACT ALREADY BEEN PAID? AND HOW -- THE ACTUAL PROJECT, HOW MANY MORE MONTHS WILL IT BE? I HAVE I ABASIC CONCERN THAT WE REALLY CAN'T STUDY TRAFFIC PATTERNS IF WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TRAFFIC RIGHT NOW. SO CAN SOME OF THAT BE
01:23:15.251: >> City Admin. Crawford: MR. HUP Y, CAN YOU RESPOND TO THAT? OR SHOULD WE COME BACK?
01:23:22.425: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I CAN WAIT AND GET A WRITTEN ANSWER. I KNOW THAT WE HAVE A NUMBER OF CONSULTANT CONTRACTS THAT ARE TRANSPORTATION AND TRAFFIC VOLUME LETTED, AND SO I'M JUST WONDERING -- VOLUME RELATED AND I'M JUST WONDERING IF THIS COULD BE ANY SAVINGS IN THOSE AREAS.
01:23:40.409: >> City Admin. Crawford: OKAY. WE WILL GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT ONE.
01:23:44.380: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:23:45.414: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO STAFF FOR PUTTING THIS TOGETHER AND THANK YOU COUNCILMEMBER LUMM FOR THE COMMENTS MADE EARLIER. I APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT. AND I DID TAKE THAT STUDY THAT YOU ARE REFERRING TO. IT WAS A WELL-PUT TOGETHER STUDY AND I WAS TRYING TO LOOK FOR IT SO I COULD SEND IT TO OUR COLLEAGUES. SPARK HAS HELPED TO FACILITATE THAT AS THEY HELPED WITH OTHER THINGS HERE WITH THE COMMUNITY. AND WE TALK ABOUT THE LDFA, AND I AM APPOINTED COUNCIL PERSON FOR THE BOARD AND AS MR. CRAWFORD ALLUDED TO EARLIER, THERE ARE A LOT OF RESTRICTIONS IN PLACE OF WHERE THAT MONEY CAN BE SPENT. IF IT'S NOT SPENT, IT NEEDS TO BE RETURNED. IT'S VERY TECHNICAL AND ONE WAY WE DID HELP OUT THE LOCAL BUSINESSES, BACK WHEN WE MET IN MARCH, WHEN THIS WAS STARTING TO BREAK OUT, WE VOTED AS A BOARD TO NOT COLLECT RENT FROM THE START-UPS INSIDE THE INCUBATORS AND THE SITES THAT SPARK OCCUPIES AND PAYS THE LDFA OR THE LDFA G GETS SUSPENDED -- IT WAS IN THE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. WE ARE TRYING WAYS TO HELP SMALL BUSINESSES AND PAY IT FORWARD AND AS WE HAVE SEEN SPARK DO IN OTHER WAYS SO JUST A SMALL COMMENT ON THAT. I KNOW WE ARE SHORT ON TIME. THE CONCERNS I HAVE WITH THE WATER PART OF THE PRESENTATION IS THAT WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT DELAYED PUTTING IN THE METERS. THAT WAS A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT THAT WE WERE GOING TO BE MAKING BECAUSE WE WERE TOLD THAT THE METERS WERE GOING TO BE FAILING. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I DIDN'T THINK WE HAD THE DISCRETION OF POSTPONING. I'M WONDERING HOW LONG THAT CAN BE POSTPONED, AND WHETHER THERE'S ANY VIOLATIONS OF CONTRACTS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT IN PLACE. ARE WE LOSING ANYTHING? I'M SURPRISED THAT WE CAN JUST PULL THE PLUG ON THAT PROGRAM WITHOUT PENALTY. AND WHETHER WE ARE GOING TO LOSE MONEY WITH BROKEN METERS THAT AREN'T REGISTERING USAGE.
01:26:08.123: >> PART OF IT IS IT'S NOT THE TIME TO BE GOING INTO HOMES HAVING PEOPLE ENTER INTO HOMES AND DOING PLUMBING WORK IN THE BASEMENTS GIVEN THE SOCIAL DISTANCING AND COVID. SO WE DON'T WANT TO BE IN THE HOMES AT THIS POINT. THE DESIRE IS TO START THE PROJECT AS SOON AS WE CAN BUT I WOULD EXPECT AT LEAST A YEAR'S DELAY IN GOING IN MAYBE TWO YEARS, DEPENDING ON HOW LONG IT TAKES TO REACH A COMFORT LEVEL TO GO INTO THE HOMES.
01:26:51.367: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  AND SHOULD WE BE CONCERNED ABOUT LOSING REVENUE ON THE OTHER END? I UNDERSTAND THE HEALTH CONCERNS?
01:26:59.208: >> THIS WILL BE GENERALLY WHEN METERS DIE, THEY DIE IN FAVOR OF THE CUSTOMER. SO YES, THERE WILL BE SOME LOSS OF REVENUE. WILL IT BE LARGE, NO. BUT IT IS AN ISSUE THAT WE HAVE TO BE AWARE OF AND MOVE FORWARD AS SOON AS WE CAN, BOTH FROM A HEALTH STANDPOINT AND A FINANCIAL STANDPOINT.
01:27:28.604: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: AND, AGAIN THIS GOES TO THE UV SYSTEM, THE MASTER PLAN FOR THE WATER DEPARTMENT, I MEAN, I'M JUST CONCERNED THAT WE MIGHT BE PUSHING THINGS OFF THAT MAY RESULT IN BIGGER COSTS LATER FOR US. IS THERE ANYTHING HERE THAT WE NEED TO BE AWARE OF BY POSTPONING SOME OF THESE THAT ARE A SOLID NUMBER? ARE THEY GOING TO ACCRUE ADDITIONAL COSTS BECAUSE WE DELAYED ACTION?
01:27:56.665: >> YOU SAW IN THE UV THAT IT WENT UP I IT THINK LIKE $33,000 BY THE DELAY WE HAD. THAT DELAY WAS BECAUSE WE DID NOT WANT CONTRACTORS IN THE PLANT WHEN THERE WAS THE HIGHEST RISK FOR COVID, TOUCHING -- YOU KNOW, INTERACTING WITH OUR STAFF NOW THAT THAT'S DOWN LOWER AND WE UNDER OUR RISKS WE ARE MOVING THAT ONE FORWARD. THE MASTER PLAN, WE DO NEED TO DO THAT BUT WE ARE NOT IN REGULATORY JEOPARDY BY DELAYING IT A YEAR OR TWO.
01:28:39.074: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: OKAY. THANK YOU FOR ANSWERING THOSE. I'M JUST GOING TO JUMP REAL QUICK, IF I COULD, BECAUSE I KNOW MY COLLEAGUES WOULD LIKE SOME TIME TO SPEAK. BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT THE COST SAVINGS THAT WE ARE TRYING TO ACHIEVE, IF I COULD SAY THAT WHEN IT COMES TO THE DEBT-RELATED COST SAVINGS, I WOULD PROBABLY BE IN FAVOR OF THAT. I MEAN, I KNOW THAT'S GOING TO RAISE SOME EYEBROWS, BUT JUST WITH THE BRIEF PRESENTATION THAT WE WERE GIVEN TONIGHT, AND THEN THINKING OF WHERE THE ECONOMY IS HEADING, AND WHERE WE'RE GOING TO BE BUYING IN, I DON'T THINK WE ARE BUYING IN AT A LOW PERIOD HERE. I THINK WE WOULD STILL BE BUYING IN A HIGH PERIOD. I DON'T THINK WE WILL SEE THE LOW MARK FOR THE DOW UNTIL PROBABLY 2022. SO THAT AS MY TWO CENTS ON THAT, AND WE HAVE A LOT OF OTHER CHOICES THAT WE CAN MAKE WITH THE DISCRETIONARY AND THE USE OF RESERVES. I HAVE A QUICK QUESTION, THOUGH AT THE BEGINNING THIS WAS A BRIEF MENTION OF $3.5 MILLION BEING TAKEN OUT OF RESERVES FOR FISCAL '20. WAS THAT SOMETHING WE PLANNED ON DOING AT THE BEGINNING OF LAST YEAR? I KNOW IF SOMEONE COULD SHED SOME LIGHT ON WHY WE WERE DIPPING IN SO MUCH. DID WE KNOW THAT WE WOULD TAKE $3.5 MILLION OUT OF THE ROBUST.
01:30:05.461: >> City Admin. Crawford: I BELIEVE IT WAS CLOSER TO $700,000 AND SOME OF IT WAS FOR REIMBURSABLE EXPENSES. SOME OF THEM WILL EITHER GET REIMBURSED THIS YEAR OR THE NEXT, FOR EXAMPLE, ON THE -- I BELIEVE THE LESLIE -- THE LESLIE SCIENCE CENTER REMEDIATION. BUT THERE WERE JUST A NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS THROUGH THE YEAR THAT HAVE ADDED UP.
01:30:25.314: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: OKAY.
01:30:26.615: >> City Admin. Crawford: I WENT BACK TO LOOK TO SEE IF ANY OF THAT MONEY WAS ABLE TO COME BACK, BUT IT'S VIRTUALLY ALL BEEN USED. IF I COULD GO BACK TO YOUR DEBT COMMENT. I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT ONE DISTINCTION ON THE DEBT, JUST FOR YOUR ALL'S AWARENESS. DURING THE VEBA TRUST, THAT'S ONE THING. IT'S AI S A SYSTEM THAT'S LARGEY CLOSED AND THE LIABILITY IS LARGELY KNOWN TO THE EXTENT OUR ASSUMPTIONS ARE ACCURATE. THE PENSION SYSTEM, WE HAVE A HYBRID SYSTEM NOW, BUT THAT IS AN OPEN SYSTEM, WHICH MEANS IN MY VIEW, NOT, WE HAVE NOT MADE PROGRESS IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS IN FUNDING, EVEN IN THE ECONOMY THAT WE HAD. SO I HAVE A BIG -- FROM A FINANCIAL PERSPECTIVE, I WOULD SAY IF YOU ARE CHOOSING BETWEEN THE TWO, EYE HAVE BIGGER HEARTBURN OVER NOT CONTRIBUTING TO THE PENSION SYSTEM BECAUSE IT'S AN OPEN LIFE SYSTEM AND WE NEED TO BE PUTTING MORE IN. I THINK YOU HEARD ME SAY THAT DURING LAST COUPLE OF YEARS DURING BUDGET TIMES.
01:31:31.547: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: EVEN SINCE ORIENTATION. (LAUGHTER). THANK YOU.
01:31:40.122: >> Mayor Taylor: ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. I HAVE COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD FOR A SECOND BITE.
01:31:46.762: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I JUST HAVE A PROCESS QUESTION. IT TAKES SIX VOTES TO PASS THE BUDGET, BUT IT TAKES EIGHT VOTES TO PASS AN AMENDMENT; IS THAT CORRECT?
01:31:59.408: >> City Admin. Crawford: IT'S ACTUALLY SEVEN FOR THE BUDGET. SIX FOR AMENDMENTS AND DURING THE BUDGET DISCUSSION AND EIGHT ANY TIME THEREAFTER.
01:32:10.252: >> Councilmember Griswold: OH, OKAY. SO I HAVE TWO CONCERNS WITH PASSING A BUDGET NEXT MONDAY NIGHT, ONE IS THERE'S A LOWER THRESHOLD TO PASS IT, AS OPPOSED TO AN AMENDMENT LATER. AND DEALING WITH THE COMMUNICATIONS BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT COUNCIL IS GOING TO LOOK SOMEWHAT OUT OF TOUCH IF WE PASS A BUDGET THAT DOESN'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE CURRENT CONDITIONS, EVEN THOUGH WE CAN'T PREDICT WHAT THE FINANCIAL CONDITIONS WILL BE IN THE FUTURE.
01:32:51.593: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:32:52.661: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME SPEAK A SECOND TIME. WE TALK ABOUT PASSING THE BUDGET BECAUSE IT WON'T STICK, AND IT WILL BE FULL OF BUDGET RESOLUTIONS AND ALL SORTS OF THINGS DURING OUR NEXT CYCLE BUT WE DON'T HAVE A CHOICE IN THIS MATTER, CORRECT? THIS IS A CITY CHARTER THING. IF COUNCIL DOES NOT VOTE ON THIS, IT JUST DEFERS TO THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR AND IT'S NOT LIKE WE HAVE MUCH CHOICE. WE CAN'T CHANGE THE CITY CHARTER NEXT WEEK.
01:33:20.188: >> City Admin. Crawford: ON THE --
01:33:21.990: >> TRUE.
01:33:22.324: >> City Admin. Crawford: ON THE PROCESS, YOU ARE CORRECT, THE NUMBER OF VOTES AND ALL OF THAT. I WOULD SAY THAT -- THAT THE BUDGET AND GOVERNMENT IS A MAXIMUM NUMBER. STAFF IS NOT PERMITTED TO GO OVER THAT NUMBER. STAFF IS PERMITTED TO GO UNDER THAT NUMBER. A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN A PRIVATE SECTOR WHERE IT'S A BIT OF A GUIDELINE AND YOU CAN HAVE THE OVERRUNS. WE HAVE TO KIND OF COME BACK TO YOU FOR THOSE OVERRUNS. AND SO STAFF VIEWS IT AS A MAXIMUM.
01:33:55.657: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND WHO HAS NOT PREVIOUSLY SPOKEN. AND THEN COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
01:34:00.796: >> Councilmember Grand: I THINK MR. CRAWFORD ANSWERED MY QUESTION BY MAKING THE POINT ABOUT THE MAXIMUM SO THAT STAFF COULD NOT MOVE FORWARD WITH SOMETHING AND NOT HAVE TO GO TO COUNCIL TO DO SO; IS THAT CORRECT?
01:34:16.244: >> City Admin. Crawford: YES. IF IT WAS A SIGNIFICANT POLICY ACTION, I WOULD CLEARLY ADVISE AND PROBABLY COME TO YOU FOR GUIDANCE. BUT THERE ARE A LOT -- THERE'S A LOT THAT I CAN DO, FOR EXAMPLE BY NOT HIRING, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT I CAN JUST DO.
01:34:31.693: >> Councilmember Grand: OKAY. I WANT TO EXTEND MY GENERAL THANKS AND MAYBE ASK A FOLLOW-UP QUESTION TO YOU. I KNOW THAT THIS WAS NOT THE EXERCISE THAT YOU WANTED TO BE ENGAGED IN WHEN YOU GAME ON IN TERMS OF THE ADMINISTRATOR AND I REALLY DO APPRECIATE ALL THE THOUGHTFULNESS AND THE DIFFICULT DISCUSSIONS THAT ARE BEHIND WHAT YOU GIVE US AND YOUR COMMITMENT TO HAVE IT BEING MISSION DRIVEN. THAT'S REALLY CRITICAL. SO I DO THINK THAT'S PART OF IT. ONE OF MY QUESTIONS TO YOU, IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE THAT YOU NEED FROM US NEXT WEEK IN LINE WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT YOU HAVE GIVEN US? FROM THERE WAS SOME WAY TO SOME TYPE OF ACKNOWLEDGMENT THAT WE WILL HAVE TO MAKE DECISIONS AHEAD?
01:35:31.353: >> City Admin. Crawford: TO THE COMMENTS EARLIER I REALLY THINK THE POLICY GUIDA GUIDANCE OF WHU VIEW AS MOST IMPORTANT THINGS TO FOCUS ON. TO THE EXTENT YOU SPEAK WITH ONE VOICE ON THAT, IT'S MOST HELPFUL. I DO THINK THAT, YOU KNOW AS WE MOVE FORWARD, THE AREAS THAT WE HAVE TO WORK ON THE MOST WILL BE -- I MEAN, WE WILL TRY TO FOCUS ON WHAT YOU IDENTIFY.
01:36:05.987: >> Councilmember Grand: FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, THIS IS IN LINE WITH A LOT OF EXISTING COUNCIL POLICY AND THE CITY'S MISSION. I REALLY APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU.
01:36:13.995: >> Mayor Taylor: AGAIN JUMPING THE CUE FOR FIRST-TIME SPEAKER, COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
01:36:20.468: >> Councilmember Bannister: HI. YES. I JUST WANTED TO FOLLOW UP ON SLIDE 16, WHERE I THINK TOM MENTIONED SOMETHING ABOUT WE WARWEREN'T GOING TO DO ANYTHING WITH THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH MILLAGE. I WANTED TO ASK WHAT THAT MEANT.
01:36:40.522: >> City Admin. Crawford: I DID NOT DO -- I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WITH THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH MILLAGE, AS FAR AS -- THOSE PRIORITIES THAT WERE ESTABLISHED FOR THAT FUNDING, I HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING WITH -- SEPARATELY. WE LOOKED AT THE FIVE MAJOR FUNDS IN THIS PRESENTATION, WHICH ARE THE SOURCES -- WHERE THE SOURCES OF REVENUES ARE JEOPARDIZING THE OPERATIONS OF THOSE FUNDS. IT IS TRUE THAT THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH REBATE MILLAGE IS UNRESTRICTED FUNDS, BUT I DID NOT SPEND MUCH TIME ON THAT FUND SINCE IT HAD ALREADY BEEN THROUGH A PRIORITIZATION DISCUSSION. THAT'S ALL I WAS SAYING.
01:37:16.558: >> Councilmember Bannister: SO YOU ARE ANTICIPATING IT WILL REMAIN 40, 40, 20?
01:37:22.530: >> City Admin. Crawford: THAT IS PRESENT COUNCIL DIRECTION AND I HAVEN'T SPENT MUCH TIME ON THAT FUND BUT I WILL EXPECT THAT TO CONTINUE UNLESS I GET OTHER GUIDANCE.
01:37:32.173: >> Councilmember Bannister: OKAY. AND -- AND THEN THAT ONE BACK ON SLIDE 9 ABOUT THE REDUCED FOOD CONTRACT MATE -- ROAD CONTRACT MAINTENANCE, BUT THE CONTRACTED ROAD MAINTENANCE, THAT WAS A LITTLE ALARMING BECAUSE I WAS THINKING THE ROADS ARE IN PRETTY BAD SHAPE. THE LOCAL STREETS FUND, AND THE REDUCED CONTRACTED ROAD MAINTENANCE. HOW WAS THAT THAT WAS SOMETHING WE WOULD JUST HAVE TO CUT AS NOT A PRIORITY?
01:38:08.143: >> YES. IT WOULD BE CAPITAL MAINTENANCE, THE SLURRY, THE CAPE SEAL TYPE PROJECTS. IT MIGHT BE SOME OF THE PAVEMENT MARKINGS MIGHT AGE A BIT MORE THAN WE WOULD LIKE NORMALLY. BUT IT WOULD BE CUTTING OUT OR REDUCING OUR CONTRACTED SERVICES.
01:38:39.140: >> City Admin. Crawford: COUNCIL MEMBER BANNISTER, LET ME -- LET ME FLOAT SOMETHING HERE THAT'S BEEN DISCUSSED A LITTLE BIT, AND TO GET -- IF YOU HAVE THE REACTIONS TO THIS, ANY OF COUNCIL, BUT ONE OF THE -- I HESITATE TO SAY ONE OF THE OPPORTUNITIES, BUT ONE OF THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PAVEMENT MANAGEMENT IS TO POTENTIALLY DO SOME SELECTED STREETS IN THE DOWNTOWN, WITH THE MILL AND FILL, AND GET IMPROVED PAVEMENT. IN ORDER TO FUND THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO GO ABOUT E LOW OUR POLICY MINIMUM, IN ACT 51, BUT IF COUNCIL HAS AN APPETITE FOR THAT, THAT'S SOMETHING THAT STAFFER HAS BEEN TALKING ABOUT TO TRY TO GET ESTIMATES AND TIMING ON. THAT WOULD -- THE WH IDEA IS THE TIME TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE TIME WHEN THE BUSINESSES ARE NOT AS ACTIVE AND NOT DISRUPT THEM WHEN THEY ARE.
01:39:37.665: >> Councilmember Bannister: THAT SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD IDEA.
01:39:40.235: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER NELSON AND THEN COUNCILMEMBER LUMM. REMEMBER WE ARE TRYING TO GET THIS COMPLETED AND PUBLIC COMMENT IN SIX MINUTES. COUNCILMEMBER NELSON?
01:39:48.410: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I WAS CURIOUS SINCE WE HAD -- WE HAVE HAD A COUPLE OF BUDGET AGENDA ITEMS OR I SHOULD SAY AGENDA ITEMS ALREADY WHERE WE ARE TRYING TO SUPPORT THE COUNTY IN THEIR EFFORTS. I'M CURIOUS WHO IS -- WHO IS IN COMMUNICATION WITH THE COUNTY? HOW -- DID WE HAVE ANY IDEA ABOUT ANY PARTICULAR ROLE WE WOULD PLAY IN THE COUNTY AS PERHAPS ONE OF THE MORE AFFLUENT TOWNS. I WAS IN A CONVERSATION WITH SOMEBODY EARLIER TODAY ABOUT THIS. DO YOU FOLLOW WHAT I'M ASKING? WE HAVE NOW HAD A COUPLE OF BUDGET ITEMS WHERE WE ARE SORT OF HELPING COUNTY -- COUNTY FUND SERVICES THAT THEY NEED TO PROVIDE AND I'M CURIOUS MOVING FORWARD IF WE HAVE ANY SENSE OF COLLABORATION WITH THE COUNTY OR -- OR A ROLE THAT WE WOULD PLAY.
01:40:45.100: >> City Admin. Crawford: WELL, MR. DELACOURT HAS COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT WITH HIM AND INTERACTS WITH THE COUNTY KIND OF FUNCTIONALLY THROUGH THAT ROLE. I ALSO PERIODICALLY DURING THIS CRISIS HAVE BEEN TALKING WITH THE COUNTY AND SOME OTHER AGENCIES AND UNDERSTANDING WHAT THEIR NEEDS ARE AND WHERE AI ROLE MIGHT BE FOR US. YOU KNOW, RECOGNIZING THAT THE RESIDENTS OF ANN ARBOR ARE THE RESIDENTS OF COUNTY AS WELL AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE COUNTY SERVICES. ANN ARBOR HAS BEEN A LEADER IN PROVIDING SUPPLEMENTAL SUPPORT AND THAT'S WHY I STAYED IN CONTACT WITH THEM, TO SEE, AND I WOULD SAY THE DISCUSSIONS I HAVE BEEN PART OF HAVE NARROWED IN TO BARRIER BUSTERS AND -- AND THE SHELTERING. THAT WAS THE GREATEST AREAS RIGHT NOW OF SUPPORT. BUT IT'S AN ONGOING DIALOGUE. THE LATEST INFORMATION IS BARRIER BUSTERS IS NOT THAT -- I DON'T THINK -- WE NEED TO JUMP IN RIGHT NOW WITH SUPPORT. AND, AGAIN, I GO BACK TO THE COMMENTS WE HEARD, LET'S SEE, I GUESS SEVERAL WEEKS AGO NOW. YOU KNOW THIS IS GOING TO BE A MARATHON AND NOT A SPRINT. IF WE STICK TO THE THINGS THAT WE ARE GOOD AT, I'M SURE THE COUNTY WILL LET US KNOW WHEN THERE IS A NEED.
01:42:11.152: >> Councilmember Nelson: OKAY.
01:42:12.487: >> City Admin. Crawford: I DON'T KNOW IF THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION.
01:42:14.022: >> Councilmember Nelson:  NO, IT DOES SORT OF. I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT WE ARE LEADER AND I JUST -- I -- BECAUSE OF THE WHOLE COUNTY IS SUFFERING, I JUST -- I GUESS I FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT US FEELING LIKE WE ARE IN A POSITION TO SUPPORT PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT AS ABLE TO FIND SUPPORT. I KNOW THAT EVERYBODY IS IN A STRUGGLE NOW, BUT ANYWAY.
01:42:42.083: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
01:42:43.952: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANKS, MR. MAYOR. OOPS. SORRY ABOUT THAT. JUST TO QUICKLY FOLLOW ON, I THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER NELSON FOR THAT QUESTION. I KNOW FOR FISCAL -- FOR '21, WE HAD SOME INITIAL ESTIMATES, OF COURSE, IN TERMS OF HUMAN SERVICES FUNDING. YES, SO IF WE COULD HAVE SOME SORT OF -- YOU MENTIONED BARRIER BUSTERS BUT SOME BEST ASSESSMENT WHAT THE FUNDING REQUIREMENTS MIGHT BE BEYOND THE FISCAL '21 PROPOSAL AND THAT WE HAD REFLECTED IN THE SHELTER AND THE COMMISSION, BEFORE THE FUNDING, WHYGENERAL FUND CONTRIBUTION, I THINK THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL, WHATEVER YOU COULD, YOU KNOW DETERMINE IN TERMS OF, YOU KNOW, GETTING KIND OF A BEST ASSESSMENT AT THIS POINT. WHAT WOULD BE HELPFUL? THE QUICKLY JUST TO CONFIRM ON THE -- IN THE FINANCIAL RECOVERY PLAN, OF COURSE, THERE WAS A DEFERRAL OF THE MASTER PLAN UPDATE, AS FISCAL -- FISCAL YEAR '20 SAVINGS, IF IT -- I U JUST TO CLARIFY, BECAUSE YOU MIGHT HAVE STATED IT AND I MISSED IT. I APOLOGIZE. IF IT WAS NOT PUT BACK IN FOR FISCAL YEAR '21 -- AND AGAIN MAYBE YOU SAID THIS -- THAT IT WOULD BE DEFERRED TO FISCAL YEAR '22.
01:44:24.652: >> City Admin. Crawford: YES.
01:44:25.286: >> Councilmember Lumm: WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IN TERMS OF THE CONSULTANT AND THE PROCESS AND ALL OF THAT.
01:44:32.694: >> City Admin. Crawford: YES, MR. DELACOURT MAY HAVE SOME COMMENTS ON THAT.
01:44:43.604: >> I THINK IF IT'S DEFERRED TO '22, THOSE PROPOSALS WOULD NO LONGER BE IN GOOD STANDING AND WE WOULD HAVE A NEW SCOPE DEPENDING ON WHERE WE WERE WITH THE MASTER PLAN AND WHAT THE SITUATION WAS AT THAT POINT.
01:44:57.285: >> Councilmember Lumm: YOU WOULD START OVER? WOW!
01:45:01.089: >> THERE'S NO WAY THOSE PROPOSALS WILL STAY IN GOOD STANDING FOR TWO YEARS. I MEAN STARTING WITH THE RFP, THE COMPETITIVE PROCESS WILL NOT BE IN GOOD STANDING ANY MORE. NOW, MAYBE THE CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE CHANGED AS FAR AS INTERNAL CAPACITY, AND THE UPDATE WE WERE LOOKING AT, WAS A SIZABLE ONE. MAYBE OTHER CHANGES OR DIRECTIONS AS A CITY AT THAT TIME WILL -- OR NECESSITY A SMALLER ADJUSTMENT TO THE PLAMASTERPLAN. WHAT I CAN CERTAINLY SAY IS THE PROPOSALS THAT HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED TO DATE, EVALUATED AND THE RECOMMENDATIONS BROUGHT TO COUNCIL WOULD NO LONGER BE IN GOOD STANDING AND SOME -- SOME PROCESS OF OUTSIDE WORK THAT WAS NECESSARY WOULD FOLLOW.
01:45:48.236: >> Councilmember Lumm: OKAY THANK YOU. HAD.
01:45:49.904: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. CLOSING OUT BEFORE PUBLIC COMMENT, I GUESS I WOULD LIKE TO SAY A COUPLE OF THINGS. FIRST, YOU KNOW, I WOULD LIKE TO TEND AND ECHO MY COLLEAGUES' THANKS TO STAFF. YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY, THAT THANKS GOES BACK TO THE BEGINNING OF THE CRISIS AND REALLY BEFOREHAND BUT CERTAINLY PUTTING TOGETHER THIS PLAN THAT, THIS ARTICULATION OF SAVINGS THAT THE ORGANIZATION CAN MAKE DURING A -- DURING A CRISIS. YOU KNOW, WE ARE, OF COURSE, LOOKING AT A VERY UNCERTAIN FINANCIAL FUTURE BUT AT THE SAME TIME, WE ALSO HAVE A MISSION THAT WE NEED TO TO PERFORM AND IT WILL BE OUR CHARGE -- OR OUR OBLIGATION TO FIND THAT BALANCE, TO AFFECT THE SERVICES BEFORE PRESENT RESIDENTS AND FUTURE RESIDENTS THAT IS REQUIRES OF US AND DOING IT IN A MANNER THAT'S FINANCIALLY FEASIBLE AND I APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT STAFF HAS DONE TO POINT US IN THIS DIRECTION. I THINK WE CERTAINLY AND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO HAVE BEEN LISTENING AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE CONTINUE TO COMMUNICATE THAT THE BUDGET PRESENTED TO US IS A PRECOVID DOCUMENT. IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO PUT TOGETHER A BUDGET OF $4,468,000,000 AND I'M COMFORTABLE MOVING FORWARD WITH IT BECAUSE OF COURSE IT'S OUR OBLIGATION TO DO SO AND I'M COMFORTABLE WITH THE SET OF AMOUNTS THAT STAFF WILL EVENTUALLY BEFORE I FORWARD TO -- TO THE -- IN ACCORDANCE WITH -- WITH THEIR ADVICE ON OUR POLICY DIRECTION THAT WILL AS A COUNCIL NEED TO AFFECT IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT WHAT WE ARE DOING FOR THE RESIDENTS TODAY, FOR THE RESIDENTS TOMORROW WE ARE ABLE TO DO. SO THANK YOU. WE NOW COME TO PUBLIC COMMENT GENERAL TIME. IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO SPEAK TO THE PUBLIC ABOUT MATTERS OF MUNICIPAL INTEREST. ONE NEED NOT HAVE SIGNED UP IN ADVANCE. SPEAKERS WILL HAVE THREE MINUTES IN WHICH TO SPEAK SO LISTEN TO THE CLERK. THE CLERK WILL KEEP TIME AND WILL ANNOUNCE WHEN 30 SECONDS ARE REMAINING. WHEN YOUR TIME IS UP, YOU WILL BE PLACED ON MUTE SO THAT WE MAY MOVE FORWARD TO THE NEXT SPEAKER. MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC INTERESTED IN SPEAKING AT PUBLIC COMMENT MAY CALL THE PHONE NUMBER ON THE SCREEN. ENTER IN THE MEETING ID. CALL-IN SHOULD BE DISPLAYED ON THE SCREEN. THE CALLER WILL BE IDENTIFIED BY THE CLERK USING THE LAST THREE NUMBERS OF YOUR PHONE NUMBER. THE YOU WILL HEAR AN AUTOMATED ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE HOST IS ALLOWING YOU TO SPEAK AND AT THAT TIME, YOUR THREE MINUTES HAVE GONE. MUTE ANY TELEVISION AND BACKGROUND NOISE SO WE CAN HEAR YOU CLEARLY. THE CLERK WILL ANNOUNCE WHEN 30 SECONDS IS REMAINING AND WHEN YOUR TIME IS UP, YOU WILL BE PLACED ON MUTE SO WE CAN MOVE ON TO THE NEXT SPEAKER. IS THERE ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT?
01:49:00.595: >> Clerk Beaudry: NO, THERE'S NO ONE PRESENT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT.
01:49:03.898: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. PUBLIC COMMENT IS CLOSED. LET'S TAKE A MOMENT TO ADJOURN. I THINK WE -- IF I RECOLLECT CORRECTLY, WE HAVE A CLOSED SESSION UPCOMING BUT BECAUSE IT'S A SPECIAL MEETING WE ARE NOT -- WE ARE NOT MER  PERMITTE. WE HAVE TO WAIT TO THE APPOINTED HOUR; IS THAT CORRECT?
01:49:23.684: >> Clerk Beaudry: THAT'S CORRECT. MAYOR, I DO HAVE ONE CALLER IF YOU WANT TO TAKE THEM.
01:49:27.888: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
01:49:37.765: >> GREETINGS CITY COUNCIL. MY NAME IS LUIS VASQUEZ. I'M A RESIDENT OF THE FIRST WARD OF ANN ARBOR, AND I WOULD LIKE TO URGE COUNCIL TO SUSPEND ALL FUNDING FOR THE CENTER OF CITY. THIS IN MY MIND IS AN UNNECESSARY EXPENDITURE AND A LOW PRIORITY AND I WOULD ALSO URGE SUPPORTERS OF CENTER OF THE CITY TO REDOUBLE THEIR EFFORTS TO RAISE PRIVATE FUNDING. [ BACKGROUND NOISE ]
01:50:32.453: >> I THINK HE'S ALL DONE.
01:50:35.022: >> Mayor Taylor: I'M SAYING THAT AS COMPLETED. MR. VASQUEZ, I ASSUME THAT YOU ARE DONE.
01:50:40.494: >> YES, THANK YOU.
01:50:42.096: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT?
01:50:48.369: >> Clerk Beaudry: MAYOR, THAT'S ALL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
