THERE ANY DISCUSSION OF THE MINUTES? ALL IN FAVOR THE MOTION, PLEASE SAY AYE OR RAISE A HAND. I SEE EVERYBODY'S HAND NOW. GREAT. THE MOTION CARRIES. NEXT UP, ITEM 6 ARE ALL THE REPORTS. COUNCILMEMBER DISCH, COULD YOU START US OFF?
00:06:00.462: >> Councilmember Disch: I HAVE TWO PIECES OF GOOD NEWS. LAST NIGHT COUNCIL APPROVED THE OUTDOOR LIGHTING ORDINANCE AMENDMENT. YES, IT WAS -- OH, FIRST READING. UH-UH. THANK YOU. WE -- WE ACTUALLY DISCUSSED IT A LITTLE BIT ON FIRST READING SO WE COULD ALL EXPRESS OUR ENTHUSIASM FOR HOW AMAZING IT IS. SO I DON'T ANTICIPATE ANY PROBLEMS WITH THAT. AND THEN ANOTHER ORDINANCE FOR FIRST READING WAS THE HOME OCCUPATIONS ORDINANCE, AND UM, COMMICOMMISSIONER MILLS KNOWS TS THAT FROM SOME COMMENTS FROM A CONSTITUENT, WE MADE A RECOMMENDATION TO PERMIT SOME OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES, NOT BY NAME BUT TO PERMIT OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES AS LONG AS THEY COULD NOT BE NUISANCES AND GENERATE DUST AND VIBRATIONS AND ALL OF THOSE OTHER THINGS THAT WE WORRY ABOUT. AND THAT AMENDMENT DID PASS AND SO SECOND READING, WE WILL CONSIDER IT. WE HAD ALSO WANTED TO REMOVE NOISE FROM THE HOME OCCUPATIONS AMENDMENT WHERE WE TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT ARE PROHIBITED FEELING THAT THERE ARE NOT MANY HOME OCCUPATION USES THAT YOU COULD DO OUTSIDE WITHOUT HAVING A LITTLE BIT OF NOISE GO OVER THE PROPERTY LINE. WE WANTED TO LEAVE IT TO THE CITY'S NOISE ORDINANCE MORE GENERAL TO REGULATE THE NOISE BUT UNFORTUNATELY COUNCILMEMBERS DID NOT WANT TO BUY THAT. AND SO THERE IS -- THERE IS A PERCEPTION THAT OUR CURRENT NOISE ORDINANCE REALLY IS NOT DOING THE TRICK AND I THINK THAT INFLUENCED THOSE CONCERNS. AND SO ANYTHING THAT WE CAN DO TO FIX THAT ONE, SPEAK THAT ONEE UP. I THINK IT'S VERY TRICKY. I THINK THE WHOLE ISSUE OF NOISE, IT'S, YOU KNOW, WHAT I HHEAR AS NOISE, AND MY OTHER NEIGHBOR IS MY NEIGHBOR IS PRACTICING WITH THEIR BAND. AND I DO HAVE NEIGHBORS WITH A BAND. THEY ARE BOTH PASSING ON TO SECOND READING AND I THINK THE NOISE PART WILL GET DEBATED ON SECOND READING. I THINK THAT'S ALL THAT INTEREST YOU. THERE WERE SOME INTERESTING THINGS AND AS USUAL, I INVITE MR. LENART TO AUGMENT.
00:08:59.808: >> Chair Mills: COMMISSIONER LENART DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD?
00:09:01.943: >> Planning Manager:  ONE, I WANT FOLLOW UP WITH A FOLLOW-UP TO PLANNING COMMISSION. THE JULY 22nd MEETING OF THE PLANNING COMMISSION, WE LEARNED THAT A WEB LINK -- AN INCORRECT WEB LINK WAS POSTED WHILE THE MEETING WAS RECORDED. IT'S AVAILABLE FOR RUEING AND THE -- THERE WAS AN INCORRECT WEB LINK AND I HAVE ELECTED TO RECONSIDER THOSE ITEMS TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE DONE APPROPRIATELY WHERE THE PUBLIC HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH IN ON THOSE. THAT RESULTS IN THE RESCHEDULING OF A PROPOSED ANNEXATION AND REZONING PETITION. THAT WILL BE APPEARING ON YOUR. IN AGEA BECAUSE WE ARE RENOTICING THAT TO MAKE SURE THE PUBLIC IS AWARE OF THAT AND THEN TWO BUSINESS ITEMS ON THIS AGENDA, THE ELECTION OF OFFICERS AND BYLAWS. SO JUST MY APOLOGIES TO THE COMMISSION AND THE PUBLIC FOR HAVING TO REPEAT THAT BUSINESS. AND THEY ARE FOR THE UPCOMING WORKING SESSION, WE ANTICIPATE THAT WE WILL HAVE TWO PLAN UNIT PETITIONS. THIS IS A REQUIRED FIRST STEP BEFORE A PETITIONER MIGHT SEEK PUD. ONE IS FOR 340 DEPOT STREET AND THE OTHER IS 340 SOUTH 5th, WHICH IS THE FORMER Y LOT. AT'S A PROJECT INITIATED BY THE CITY ITSELF. BOTH OF THO WILL BE ON THE EN NEXT WK. THAT'SLL I HAVE. Chair Mls: THAN YOU VERY ARE THERE ANY OTHER COMMISSIONERS, OFFICERS OR COMMITTEE LIAISONS THAT HAVE REPORTS THIS MONTH? I WILL JUST REPORT BACK THAT THE ORDINANCE REVISIONS COMMITTEE, THAT'S THE O.R.C. WHICH MEETS FOURTH TUESDAY OF THE MONTH, DID MEET LAST -- LAST TUESDAY OF JULY. YES, WE'RE IN AUGUST. WE TALKED ABOUT THE TC-1 REZONING. A LIST OF POTENTIAL PARCELS IN AND AROUND THE STATE AND EISENHOWER AREA THAT STAFF IS REACHING OUT TO ABOUT REZONING AND THE COMMUNICATIONS PLAN FOR THAT, AND PUBLIC INPUT ASSOCIATED WITH THAT. ONE THE CHANGES OR ONE THE THINGS WAS REACHING OUT TO THOSE AFFECTED PARCELS BUT ALSO THEIR NEIGHBORS TO LET THEM KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON AND START CONVERSATIONS. AND THEN THERE WOULD BE MORE PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT BEYOND THAT. WE TALKED ABOUT PARKING REGULATIONS. AND THAT'S ON OUR WORK PLAN. IT'S KIND OF STEPPING THROUGH THE PATH OF REGULATION CHANGES IN THE CITY AND GETTING OUR FEEDBACK, O.R.C.'S FEEDBACK ON WHERE TO START AND SO THE IDEA OF PARKING MINIMUMS WAS ON THE LIST. ALSO LOOKING AT MAXIMUMS, DISCUSSION ABOUT WHETHER IT SHOULD BE ALL DISTRICTS OR SOME DISTRICTS AND HOW THIS INTERSECTS ALONG TRANSIT CORRIDORS. SO STAFF LAID OUT A WORK PLAN KIND OF GOING FORWARD COMMUNICATIONS TO O.R.C. AND KIND OF A TIMELINE. SO THAT IS -- THAT WAS DISCUSSED LAST WEEK. LORD. SEEING NO OTHER COMMUNICATIONS AMONG OFFICERS. WE RECEIVED A NUMBER OF WRITTEN COMMUNICATIONS THAT ARE EMAILED OUT AND ON THE PACKET IN THE COMMUNICATION SECTION ONLINE. SO JUST TO HIGHLIGHT. THAT. ITEM NUMBER 7 IS PUBLIC COMMENT. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PERSONS TO SPEAK FOR UP TO THREE MINUTES ABOUT AN ISSUE THAT'S NOT LISTED AS A PUBLIC HEARING ON THIS AGENDA. TONIGHT, WE WILL HAVE THREE PUBLIC HEARINGS, THE WEST STADIUM PROPOSAL, THE RESEARCH PARK DRIVE PROPOSAL AND THEN THE PROPOSED CHANGES TO THE UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE FOR SITE PLAN REVIEW THRESHOLDS. IF THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE YOU WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS PLANNING COMMISSION ON, NOW IS THE APPROPRIATE TIME TO PROVIDE THAT COMMENT. YOU CAN SPEAK BY PRESSING STAR NINE IF YOU ARE LISTENING BY PHONE. AND IF YOU HAVE JOINED US THROUGH THE WEBINAR LINK, THEN YOU CAN USE THE RAISE HAND FEATURE. FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE WATCHING ONLINE, YOU CAN CALL US TO CALL INTO THE MEETING BY DIALING 877-853-5247, AND THEN ENTERING MEETING I.D.97766341226. CITY STAFF WILL CALL ON YOU, EITHER BY TALLING THE NAME THAT -- CALLING THE NAME THAT MR. LENART SEES ON ZOOM OR THE LAST THREE OF YOUR PHONE NUMBER. PLEASE TRY TO MUTINY BACKGROUND SOUND, ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE WATCHING US THROUGH LIVE STREAM ON TV. WHEN SPEAKING OR AT THE BEGINNING OF YOUR COMMENTS PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS. I SEE SOME HANDS UP. SO WE CAN START PROMOTING FOLKS.
00:14:30.138: >> Planning Manager:  CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 955. CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER 955. YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES.
00:14:39.080: >> HELLO COMMISSIONERS, KURT WESTPHAL, 3505 CHARTER PLACE IN WARD TWO. I WAS ORIGINALLY CALLING TO SPEAK ON WEST STADIUM BOULEVARD. WHILE I'M HERE, ON A SEPARATE TOPIC, AND PARKING WAS MENTIONED, I FEEL COMPELLED TO CHIME IN. I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO TAKE THE BROADEST POSSIBLE VIEW OF WHAT THE COMMUNITY'S VISION FOR AUTOMOBILE USE IS IN THE CITY, IN TERMS OF NEW DEVELOPMENTS. I THINK PARKING PARKED A LOT OF EMOTION AMONG PEOPLE IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD, WHEN WE TALK ABOUT MINIMUM AND MAXIMUMS. IT SOUNDS THREATENING. YOU KNOW, OF COURSE THIS IS ALL HAVING TO DO WITH NEW DEVELOPMENT. AND I THINK THE LOOMING QUESTION IS:  DO WE WANT -- RIGHT NOW, WE REQUIRE A LOT OF PARKING. WE REQUIRE SUBURBAN-STYLE DEVELOPMENT EVERYWHERE, EXCEPT DOWNTOWN. AND, YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT DOES NOT COMPORT WITH THE PLANS THAT BEEN DEVELOPED IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. OR THE MASTER PLAN, FRANKLY, WHICH IS QUITE OLD AT THIS POINT, BUT STILL SAYS LESS AUTO DEPENDENT USES. I THINK THE PETITION ABOUT WEST STADIUM LATER ALSO BEGS THE SAME QUESTION. IF WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF REZONING CORRIDORS WHICH MAY TAKE A LONG TIME, DO YOU WANT TO SEE NEW DEVELOPMENTS COMING IN WITH THE PARKING THAT WE CURRENTLY REQUIRE? AND TO ME, I THINK IT'S A VERY URGENT ISSUE FOR CLIMATE REASONS FOR HOUSING REASONS AND WALKABILITY REASONS. THAT I THINK NO NEW DEVELOPMENTS SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO HAVE THE KIND OF PARKING THAT WE RIGHT NOW. SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO TAKE A BROAD AND AGGRESSIVE LOOK AT WHAT'S POSSIBLE. AND I WILL SPEAK TO YOU IN ANOTHER FEW MINUTES. THANKS.
00:17:07.295: >> Chair Mills: THANK YOU. IF ANYONE ELSE IS ON THE TELEPHONE AND WANTS TO PROVIDE A PUBLIC COMMENT NOW, YOU CAN PRESS STAR FINE ON YOUR PHONE. THOSE WHO HAVE JOINED VIA ZOOM TO PROVIDE A PUBLIC COMMENT ON SOMETHING WE DON'T HAVE A PUBLIC HEARING ON, YOU CAN USE THE RAISE HAND FUNCTION. I AM NOT SEEING ANY. I WILL REMIND YOU, IN ADDITION TO THE PUBLIC HEARINGS, WE'LL ALSO HAVE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY FOR PUBLIC COMMENT AT THE END OF THE MEETING. ITEM NUMBER 8, MR. CLINTON 8 MRN YOU UPDATE US ON WHAT THE PUBLIC HEARINGS ARE FOR THE NEXT BUSINESS METER?
00:17:49.704: >> Planning Manager:  YES --
00:17:51.539: >> Chair Mills: YOUR AUDIO IS REALLY BAD FOR ME. AND IT LOOKS LIKE I HAVE HEAD NODS. SO IT'S NOT JUST ME. LENS SORRY ABOUT THAT. IS THIS BETTER IF I'M A LITTLE BIT CLOSER?
00:18:02.717: >> Chair Mills: YES.
00:18:03.184: >> Planning Manager:  MY APOLOGIES. FOR THE NEXT REGULAR BUSINESS MEETING, THE 17th. YES. AUGUST 17th. WE HAVE A FULL SLATE OF BUSINESS FOR YOU. THE PUBLIC HEARING ITEMS ON 336 SOUTH ASHLEY. THIS IS A PROPOSED SITE PLAN FOR AT THE COUNCIL APPROVAL TO ENCLOSE THE FRONT PORCH ZONED D-2. WE HAVE A PROPOSED MODIFICATION TO EXISTING PLAN UNIT DEVELOPMENT AT 7 700 TAPPAN STREET. THIS IS TO REVISE THE SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS TO REMOVE A REQUIREMENT THAT A CURB CUT BE CLOSED ON THAT SITE. BOTH OF THESE TWO ARE RELATED TO RECENT MARIJUANA FACILITIES THAT HAVE BEEN APPROVED. WE HAVE A THIRD HEARING FOR A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT AT MILL CREEK TOWNHOMES ON -- THIS IS A REQUEST TO REZONE THE 32.6-ACRE MILL CREEK TOWNHOME SITE FROM R-3, TO R4-B. THE SITE CURRENTLY CONTAINED 281 DWELLING UNITS AND A SITE CENTER AND PROPOSED TO CONSTRUCTION 102 MORE DWELLING UNITS IN AND FOUR BUILDINGS AND REKNOW ELEVATOR THE COMMUNITY CENT -- RENOVATE THE COMMUNITY CENTER AND THEN THE GEDDES, THE PROPOSAL TO ANNEX A 1.5-ACRE SITE TO THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR AND ZONE IT R1A. THIS IS A RENOTICE OF THE PETITION PREVIOUSLY ON THE JULY 22nd MEETING.
00:19:40.848: >> Chair Mills: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NOW ON TO 9A., REGULAR BUSINESS. FIRST UP WILL BE THE 2040 AND 2060 WEST STADIUM BOULEVARD SITE PLAN FOR CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL AND SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE PERMIT FOR A DRIVE THRU. OUR STANDARD PROCEDURE IS THAT THE PETITIONER WILL HAVE UP TO TEN MINUTES TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT AND INTRODUCE IT TO US. FOLLOWED BY A STAFF PRESENTATION. MR. KING WILL FILL IN ANY PLANNING-RELATED DETAILS AND ZONING DETAILS WE MIGHT NEED. WE WILL HAVE THE PUBLIC HEARING AND THEN WE'LL HAVE DISCUSSION AMONG THE PLANNING COMMISSIONERS.
00:20:25.727: >> Planning Manager:  YES, MR. PREVIRA. IS ANYONE DOING AN INDIVIDUAL PRESENTATION?
00:20:32.066: >> I'M PRIMARILY DOING THE FIRST PART OF IT AND THEN TED HIRSCH FROM M.C.I. AND DAVE NIBBES.
00:20:45.680: >> Planning Manager:  I JUST NEED TO AUTHORIZE ONE OF YOU FOR YOUR POWER POINT.
00:20:50.118: >> YEAH, I CAN HANDLE THE VISUALS. DO YOU WANT ME TO BRING UP THE VISUALS THEN?
00:20:57.392: >> Planning Manager:  YEAH, HOLD ON. LET ME --
00:21:00.194: >> YEAH, WE WERE A LITTLE CONFUSED AS TO WHETHER WE WERE GOING TO DO THAT OR CHRIS IS GOING TO DO THAT.
00:21:07.535: >> I'M PREPARED TO UPLOAD THE POWERPOINT ALSO. I WILL LEAVE IT TO WHAT IS THE MOST CONVENIENT.
00:21:13.841: >> GIVE ME A SECOND, CHRIS. I SHOULD BE READY TO GO.
00:21:28.656: >> I THINK WE GOT IT.
00:21:30.291: >> Chair Mills: IT LOOKS GOOD.
00:21:31.259: >> THANK YOU AGAIN FOR ALLOWING US TO COME BEFORE YOU. WE WERE BACK, I BELIEVE, LAST DECEMBER. WITH THE PLAN THAT HAD A FOUR-STORY STORAGE FACILITY ON IT, AS WELL AS THE BRANCH RETAIL AND OFFICE. REAL QUICK I HAVE MYSELF, SEAN HAVERA, WE ARE SERVING AS THE OWNER'S REPRESENTATIVE, FOR NORTH STAR ANN ARBOR PROPERTIES LLC, WE HAVE DAVID SASS WOULD IS THE PRESIDENT THERE AND THEN TODD CO-BERT AND HEAD HIRSCH, AS WELL AS TINA FIX WHO ARE WITH MIDWEST CONSULTING AND THEN DAVID NIBBES. I HAVE SEEN SOME NEW FACES FROM THE LAST TIME. WE ARE ALONG THE PARKI REAR PORTN OF OUR PROPERTY. CURRENTLY THIS CORRIDOR CONSTS OFIXED USE OF COMMEIAL RETAND RESTAURANT-TYPE AND THEN THE MASTER PLAN DOES CALL FOR SPECIFIC -- SPECIFIC TYPES OF STADIUM COMMERCIAL CORRIDOR. SO THIS LOCATION IS -- CONSIDERATION OF WHY THIS FACILITY IS LOOKING AT FOR A BRANCH RETAIL LOCATION AS WELL AS OFFICE. AGAIN, THE COMMERCIAL BETWEEN RETAIL AND RESTAURANT BUSINESSES, WE HAVE ALREADY HEARD FROM A FEW THAT WITH NORTH STAR GOING THERE, THEY WOULD LOOK AT MOVING THEIR BANKING OVER TO THEM. THERE'S ALSO PROXIMITY TO THE RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD THAT ABUT US TO THE EAST. WE'RE ALSO NEARBY JACKSON ROAD AND I-94. THERE'S SEVERAL ANN ARBOR BUS ROUTES ALONG THERE AS WELL AND THEN ALSO THE CONFICKURATION DOES LEND ITSELF VERY WELL. SO THIS IS THE EXISTING FACILITY. THERE'S A VACANT DEALERSHIP THERE. ONE OF THE NATURAL FEATURES, THERE'S ONE LANDMARK TREE IN THIS AREA WHICH IS OFFSITE WHICH WE WILL BE PROTECTING. AND ALSO TOO THAT THE CURRENT FACILITY IS IN THE PROCESS OF BEING DEMOED ACTUALLY AS WE SPEAK. FOR THE PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT, WE DID GET RID OF THE FOUR-STORY STORAGE UNIT. CURRENTLY AT THIS POINT IN TIME, WE ARE PROPOSING TO MAKE THIS A VACANT PIECE OF PROPERTY WHICH WE WOULD THEN SELL OFF TO SOMEONE ELSE TO DO A FUTURE DEVELOPMENT AND THEN WE WOULD FOCUS ON THE BANK OFFICE BUILDING BACK IN THE SAME CORNER WHICH IT WAS PREVIOUSLY. PREVIOUSLY, THERE WERE THREE DRIVE THRUS. WE HAVE SINCE REDUCED THAT TO TWO. LET'S SEE, IN REGARDS TO THE E.V. ORDINANCE, WE HAVE AI TOTAL OF SIX E.V. STATIONS, SIX READY AND SEVEN CAPABLE. WE HAVE 45 THAT ARE REQUIRED PARKING AND THEN 52 THAT WAS BASED UPON A LOOK AT NOT ONLY THE RETAIL PORTION FOR CONSUMERS HERE BUT THEN ALSO THE SECOND FLOOR OFFICE AS WELL. WE HAVE -- WE ARE IN THE PROCESS AS PART OF THIS TOO. WE WILL BE GRANTING VARIOUS EASEMENTS TO THE NORTH PARCEL. ONE OF THOSE PRIMARILY BEING AN INGRESS EGRESS EASEMENT SO THAT IN THE FUTURE SHOULD ANYBODY DEVELOP THIS SITE AND WHOEVER IT MAY BE, IT WOULD LIMIT CURB CUTS FOR THEM AND THEN THIS WOULD SERVE AS THE MAIN CURB CUT INTO THE FACILITY. FROM THE LANDSCAPE BUFFER STANDPOINT AND YOU CAN JUMP IN HERE IF I DO ANYTHING WRONG. WE HAVE THE CONFLICTING LAND USE -- OOPS. LAND USE BUFFER ALONG THE REAR PORTION OF THE PROPERTY. AND THEN WE HAVE MOVED THE STREET TREES TO BE ON OUR SIDE OF THE PARCEL THAT IS PART OF THE ZBA VARIANCE REQUEST THAT WE NEED TO BE REQUESTING BECAUSE AS YOU ARE AWARE SOUTH STADIUM, THERE ARE NOT CURRENTLY STREET TREES ALONG THAT ROAD AND THE LANDSCAPE MODIFICATION ORDINANCE DOES NOT ALLOW FOR THAT TYPE OF VARIANCE TO BE GRANTED UNDERNEATH THAT ADDITIONALLY, BECAUSE IT'S CONTAMINATED THERE'S BIORETENTION. ISLANDS WHICH I BELIEVE BRETT AND CHRISTIAN ADDRESS. PLANNING IS IN FAVOR BOTH OF THOSE VARIANCES. THE UTILITY STANDPOINT WE WORKED WITH ENGINEERING ON ALL THE STORMWATER RETENTION, IT CONTAINED ON SITE. THIS IS AN ENCLOSED CHAMBER DUE TO THE CONTAMINATION ON SITE, OUR WATER SERVICE LEADS WOULD BE OFF OF STADIUM, AS WELL AS WE WOULD BE EXTENDING THE SANITARY SERVICE DOWN AND THEN UP AND OVER TO THE FACILITY. FROM A DO CARE STANDPOINT. WE WANT TO INCLUDE A SITE -- SO WE DO PRIMARILY HAVE PETROLEUM-BASES CONTAMINATION ON THE SITE. IF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH V.O.C.s, THEY IT END TO DROP AS THEY DI DISSIPATE BUT WE NEEO TREAT EVERYTHING AS CONTAMINATED SO ANY EXCAVATED SOIL WOULD BE STOCKPILED AND IF WE CAN LABEL IT AS CLEAN, IT'S TAKEN TO THE CLEAN PORTION OF THE LANDFILL. AND IF NOT, IT WILL BE TAKEN TO THE CONTAMINATED LANDFILL. ANY SOIL WE DO STOCKPILING ON SITE, IT WOULD BE PLASTIC SHEETING AND TO CONTAIN IT. ANY GROUNDWATER THAT IS CONTAINED, WE DISPOSE OF IN APRIL APPROVED MANNER AND THERE'S A V A VARIETY OF MANNER. WHAT WE WILL BE DOING IS REMOVING SIX INCHES OF THE EXISTING FILL AND BACKFILLING THAT IN WITH CLEAN SOIL AND SEEDING IT ALONG WITH A DEMARCATION BARRIER, AS FAR AS WHO FUTURE DEVELOPS. IT ANY OF THE TRENCHES, THE APPROPRIATE MITIGATION BARRIERS IN PLACE FOR THOSE, AS WELL AS THE UTILITY PIPES THAT WE WILL USE THE NECESSARY TYPES OF GASKETS THAT NEED TO BE DONE. AND P.R. ENVIRONMENTAL WE WILL BE RETAINING TO HANDLE AND OVERSEE THIS FOR US AS WELL. SO THIS WAS THE PREVIOUS DEVELOPMENT WITH THE FOUR-STORE E STORAGE BUILDING, WITH THE OFFICE BUILDING HERE WHICH ORIGINALLY WAS THREE STORIES. AND AS WE HAVE NOTED, WE HAVE REMOVED THE STORAGE FACILITY AND WE HAVE LOWERED DOWN THE BUILDING FROM A THREE STORY TO A TWO STORY. PART OF THAT WAS TO, AGAIN, REDUCE THE PARKING REQUIREMENTS THAT WERE NECESSARY IN THE CURRENT ORDINANCE AS WELL. WE HAVE OUR CITIZEN PARTICIPATION MEETING. THE CITIZENS GREATLY APPRECIATED US LOWERING THAT DOWN EVEN THOUGH SOME OF THE HOMES THEY SAID YOU WOULD STILL BE ABLE TO SEE SOME OF THE BIL BUILDING FRM THE SECOND FLOORS IN THE BACK BUT THEY APPRECIATED LOWERING IT DOWN FROM THREE TO TWO. WE ARE UTILIZING A VRF HVAC SYSTEM AND THEN WE WILL BE USING HIGH EFFICIENT LIGHTING AND CONTROLS ALONG WITH HIGH EFFICIENCY WATER FIXTURES AND EFFICIENT BUILDING ENVELOPE AS WELL. WHAT WE WERE ASKING FOR IS FOR APPROVAL FOR THE SITE PLAN FOR THE REDEVELOPMENT. SUPPORT AND THEN THE APPROVAL FOR THE SPECIAL USE FOR DRIVE THROUGH. AND THAT'S ALL I HAVE. I BELIEVE MR. CHANG DID SEND ALONG INFORMATION PERTAINING TO OUR RESPONSE TO THE VARIOUS COMPONENTS OF THE A2ZERO PLAN, AS WELL AS SUPPORT FOR INFORMATION FROM MR. SASS IN REGARDS TO WHAT THEY HAVE SEEN IN REGARDS TO THE USE OF DRIVE THROUGHS ESPECIALLY DURING WHAT WE HAVE EXPERIENCED OVER LAST YEAR WHICH IS EVIDENCED BY THIS MEETING AS WELL, THAT SHOWS DISTANCING AND THAT'S STILL A A KEY COMPONENT OF THE WORLD WE LIVE IN RIGHT NOW. AND THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE.
00:29:42.049: >> Chair Mills: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
00:29:44.151: >> THAT WAS A VERY GOOD PRESENTATION, MR. HAVERA. WE DO HAVE A NEW PLANNING COMMISSION MEMBER. WELCOME ABOARD COMMISSIONER WYCHE. FIRST, THE REAR OF THE PROPERTY, IT'S ZONED P FOR PARKING. SO THERE'S A 100-FOOT WIDE STRIP THAT IS NOT REZONED AS IT WAS IN THE PREVIOUS SUBMITTAL. SO THAT'S THERE THAT IS B PHONING AND THEY HAVE A 100-FOOT BUFFER. I WOULD REITERATE THAT THERE ARE TWO VARIANCES BUN BEING THE STREET TREES UP FRONT. IT'S REALLY BECAUSE THERE'S JUST NO ROOM BETWEEN THE SIDEWALK AND THE ROAD TO ACTUALLY PLANT THE TREES. SO THEY WILL PLANT THEM ON THEIR OWN PRIVATE SIDE OF THE PROPERTY AND ALSO FOR THE BIORETENTION ISLANDS BECAUSE DUE TO THE CONTAMINATION ON SITE, THAT IS SCHEDULED FOR THOSE OUT THERE THAT ARE INTERESTED FOR THE AUGUST 25th ZBA. OUR CITY FOREST HAS SUPPORTED THOSE PROPOSED VARIANCES. I THINK MAYBE SOMETHING ELSE THAT PLANNING FOR THE NEW MEMBER. THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE. IT ONLY GETS APPROVAL THROUGH THE CITY PLANNING COMMISSION. SO IN THE DRIVE THROUGH IS PROVED TONIGHT, THEN IT WILL MOVE ON TO CITY COUNCIL FOR THE SITE PLAN PORTION. AND I THINK THAT'S ABOUT ALL I CAN THINK OF OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD, BUT I'M OPEN TO ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE.
00:31:20.247: >> Chair Mills: THANK YOU. WE WILL HAVE THE PUBLIC HEARING NEXT AND THEN THE DISCUSSIONS AND QUESTIONS FOR MR. CHENG. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO SPEAK THREE MINUTES ABOUT THE PROPOSED 2040 AND 2060 WEST STADIUM SITE PLAN. IF YOU WISH TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION ON THIS ITEM, PLEASE PRESS STAR NINE IF YOU ARE LISTENING BY PHONE OR USE THE RAISE HAND FEATURE, IF YOU ARE VIEWING THIS THROUGH THE WEB LINK. IF YOU ARE WATCHING US ONLINE, OR ON TV, AND WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE A PUBLIC COMMENT DURING THE PUBLIC HEARING, YOU CAN CALL IN YOU NO. THE CALL-IN NUMBER IS 877-853-5247. AND OUR MEETING I.D. IS 97766341226. CITY STAFF WILL SELECT CALLERS THAT HAVE RAISED THEIR HAND, CALLING ON YOU BY THE LAST THREE DIGIT OF THE TELEPHONE NUMBER OR BY THE KNOWN THAT APPEARS IN ZOOM. AND ONCE YOU ARE UNMUTED AND ALLOWED TO SPEAK, PLEASE MOVE TO A QUIET AREA, MUTINY TELEVISION OR BACKGROUND SOUNDS SO THAT WE CAN HEAR YOU CLEARLY AND PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS AT THE BEGINNING OF YOUR COMMENTS.
00:32:47.334: >> MR. WEST FALL.
00:32:49.169: >> KURT WESTPHAL, 3505 CHARTER PLACE. YOU KNOW, IT'S ALWAYS POSITIVE SIGN WHEN FOLKS WANT TO WE DEVELOP IN THE CITY AND INVEST IN OUR COMMUNITY. UNFORTUNATELY, I STRONGLY BELIEVE THIS IS NOT AN APPROPRIATE PLACE FOR A DRIVE THRU. SEVERAL YEARS AGO, WE MADE DRIVE THRUS CITYWIDE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USES BECAUSE WE WANTED TO HELP ENCOURAGE WALKABILITY AND LESS AUTO INTENSIVE USES. SO THAT'S WHY FOLKS HAVE TO COME FOR AN EXTRA PERMISSION TO HAVE A DRIVE THRU. AND AS YOU KNOW, THIS STRETCH OF STADIUMA LONG WITH MANY OTHERS IN THE CITY ARE BEING SLATED FOR -- ARE IN THE QUEUE FOR TC-1 REZONING. SO OF THE JUST AS A REVIEW FOR THE REASONS -- THE CRITERIA THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO BE USED TO JUSTIFY A SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE, ONE OF THEM IS THAT IT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE GENERAL OBJECTIVES OF THE CITY MASTER PLAN, WITH REGARD TO THAT, I THINK AS WE ALL KNOW, THERE WERE SEVERAL PAGES OF THE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE MASTER PLAN THAT WERE USED TO JUSTIFY TC-1. AND THE CREATION OF THE TC-1 DISTRICT. AND AMONG THOSE IS WALKABILITY AND RESTRICTION OF DRIVE THRUS AND REDUCING AUTO ORIENTED USES LIKE DRIVE THRUS. THESE ARE ALL VERBATIM FROM DIFFERENT ELEMENTS OF THE MASTER PLAN AND THINGS LIKE THE CLIMATE ACTION PLAN AND OTHER PLANS THAT DISCOURAGE DRIVE-ONLY BUSINESSE OR BUSINESSES THAT ENCOURAGE ANOTR CRIRIA FOR APPROVING A SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE IS THAT IT'S COMPATIBLE WITH THE EXISTING AND PLANNED CHARACTER OF THE VICINITY. CLEARLY THIS HAS APPEARED IN OUR LITERATURE AS A PLACE THAT WE ARE PLANNING TO CHANGE THE CHARACTER OF THE GENERAL VICINITY. AND ANOTHER CRITERIA IS IT WON'T HAVE A DETRIMENTAL EFFECT ON THE SURROUNDING ENVIRONMENT. AS THE CARBON NEUTRALITY PLAN STATES, THESE TYPES OF USES INCREASE DRIVING AND THAT HAS A DETRIMENTAL EFFECT ON THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT. SO THERE'S ONLY REALLY ONE CRITERIA WHERE THIS IS JUSTIFIED TO BE BUILT AND THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE GENERAL CHARACTER OF THE CURRENT NEIGHBORHOOD. SO I THINK MOST OF THE CRITERIA IT FAILS TO MEET FOR SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE. SO I WOULD URGE YOU TO DENY THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE AND, YOU KNOW, HOPEFULLY IN A FUTURE ITERATION, THESE FOLKS WOULD COME BACK ASKING FOR A TC-1 REZONING AND BUILD ON BOTH PARCELS AND NOT JUST ONE.
00:35:57.357: >> Chair Mills: THANK YOU.
00:35:58.125: >> THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
00:36:00.227: >> Chair Mills: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IF YOU HAVE DIALED IN AND WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A COMMENT, YOU CAN PRESS STAR NINE TO RAISE YOUR HAND. IF YOU ARE ON ZOOM AND WANT TO RAISE YOUR HAND, YOU CAN USE THE RAISE HAND FUNCTION.
00:36:19.880: >> HELLO, MY NAME IS ADAM JESKEVICH, I LIVE IN WARD 4 OFF THE WEST STADIUM CORRIDOR. I BIKE OR WALK PAST THIS PARCEL ON MY WAY TO ARBOR FARMS AS WELL AS OTHER BUSINESSES TO THE NORTH ALONG THE CORRIDOR. AND I AGREE WITH THE PREVIOUS CALLER IN ASKING THAT YOU DENY THIS SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE PERMIT FORA DRIVE THRU ON WEST STADIUM. IT'S WITH GOOD REASON THAT OUR CITY HAS MADE DRIVE THRUS A SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE. DRIVE THRUS ARE NOT GOOD FOR PEOPLE BIKING OR WALKING AND THERE ARE ALREADY A LOT OF DRIVE THRUS ALONG THIS CORRIDOR. SIX OR SEVEN BANKS AND THREE FAST FOOD RESTAURANTS. ADDITIONALLY THIS AREA IS PLANNED TO BE ONE OF THE TRANSIT CORRIDOR ZONING DISTRICTS WITH DENSE, WALKABLE URBAN DEVELOPMENT. A DRIVE THRU IS JUST NOT APPROPRIATE IN THIS AREA. THANK YOU AND I YIELD MY TIME.
00:37:10.130: >> Chair Mills: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IF ANYONE ELSE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A COMMENT, PLEASE USE THE RAISE HAND FUNCTION OR PRESS STAR NINE ON YOUR PHONE TO INDICATE THAT. ALL RIGHT. I HAVE A QUESTION. WE HAVE TWO DIFFERENT MOTIONS AND TWO DIFFERENT GOALS. IF WE WANTED TO TAKE THEM SEPARATELY, DO I READ BOTH OF THEM NOW OR WHAT IS THE PROCESS?
00:37:43.830: >> Planning Manager:  I THINK YOU CAN READ THEM BOTH NOW BUT IF DESIRED, IF THEY ARE MOVED AND SUPPORTED NOW TOGETHER, YOU WOULD TAKE ACTION THEN IF DESIRE TO SPLIT THEM WITH AN AMENDMENT TO DO THAT. OR IF YOU ARE OF THE MIND THAT YOU WOULD PREFER TO TAKE THEM INDEPENDENTLY, I WOULD SUGGEST MOVING AND SECONDING THE FIRST AND DISCUSSION OF THAT AND THEN MOVE ON TO THE SECOND.
00:38:11.391: >> Chair Mills: OKAY. I'M GOING TO READ THEM BOTH AND THEN WE'LL DECIDE THE FIRST ITEM FOR BUSINESS IF SOMEBODY WANTS TO SEPARATE THEM OUT SO THAT WE VOTE ON THE DRIVE THRU VERSUS THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION VERSUS THE SITE PLAN SEPARATELY, WE CAN DO THAT ONCE WE START THE DISCUSSION. THE TWO OF THEM, FIRST ONE, THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION AFTER HEARING ALL INTERESTED PERSONS AND REVIEWING ALL RELEVANT INFORMATION, FINDS THE PETITION TO SUBSTANTIALLY MEET THE STANDARDS IN CHAPTER 55 UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE. APPROVES THE 2060 WEST STADIUM SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE FOR A TWO-LANE DRIVE THRU BANK FACILITY WITH THE FOLLOWING CONDITION, ONE APPROVAL OF THE 2060 WEST STADIUM SITE PLAN BY THE CITY COUNCIL. THIS APPROVAL IS BASED ON THE FOLLOWING FINDINGS, ONE, THERE BE CONSISTENT WITH THE GENERAL OBJECTIVES OF CITY MASTER PLAN OF COMMERCIAL USES IN THE AREA, TWO, THE PROPOSED USE WILL BE CONSISTENT WITH THE C2B BUSINESS SERVICE DISTRICT WHICH PROVIDES FOR COMMERCIAL AND RETAIL ACTIVITIES AS WELL AS OFFICE USES. THREE, THE PROPOSED USE WILL NOT ADVERSELY IMPACT TRAFFIC, PEDESPEDESTRIANS BICYCLE, CIRCUN OR ROAD INSECTIONS BASED ON THE LOCATION. IT'S CONSISTENT WITH OTHER SURROUNDING USES TRAFFIC IMPACT. SO THAT'S THE FIRST MOTION AND THEN THE SECOND IS THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION HEREBY RECOMMENDS THAT THE MAYOR AND THE CITY COUNCIL APPROVE THE 2060 WEST STADIUM SITE PLAN SUBJECT TO, ONE, COMBINING THE SUBJECT LOT WITH 2040 WEST STADIUM, TWO, DIVIDING THE SUBJECT PARCEL FROM THE PARENT PARCEL, THREE, GRATING AND BUILDING PERMITS NOT ISSUED UNTIL THE EXISTING DEALERSHIP BUILDING AFTER DEMOLISHED. CAN I HAVE A COMMISSIONER MOVE THOSE MOTIONS? MOVEDDED AND SECONDED BY HAMMERSCHMIDT. DOES ANYBODY CARE TO TAKE THEM SEPARATELY?
00:40:23.757: >> Planning Manager:  YOU CAN START DISCUSSING THEM AND THEN --
00:40:32.866: >> Chair Mills: AND I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S MY WONKY -- NO, IT'S MR. LENART. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TONIGHT, BUT. OKAY. DOES ANYBODY WANT TO KICK OFF DISCUSSION? COMMISSIONERS? OR QUESTIONS FOR STAFF? YES, COMMISSIONER WYCHE.
00:40:51.117: >> CAN YOU REPEAT THE SECTION OF THE U.D.C. THAT YOU NOTED IN THE READING OF THE MOTION OR IF THERE'S A VISUAL OF THE READING OF THE MOTION? I COULD JUST REFER TO THAT.
00:41:06.399: >> Chair Mills: SO THE SECTION THAT IS SPECIFIC TO SITE PLAN. THAT WAS TO ME.
00:41:11.471: >> WHAT YOU READ IT, YOU SAID 5.25 BUT I DIDN'T GET THE THIRD POINT AND THERE'S ONLY THREE AND SO I'M JUST TRYING TO LOCATE IT INSIDE THE U.D.C.
00:41:23.516: >> Chair Mills: AT LEAST WHAT I GOT FROM THE MOTION WAS 5.29.
00:41:30.724: >> GOT IT. THANK YOU. I WROTE 5.25.5. SO THAT'S WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR AND I COULDN'T FIND IT.
00:41:39.299: >> Planning Manager:  THAT LANGUAGE IS ALSO IN THE ATHAT. ATTACHEDSTAFF REPORT.
00:41:50.110: >> I CAN'T HEAR YOU BRETT.
00:41:51.378: >> Planning Manager:  IT'S ALSO IN THE ATTACHED STAFF REPORT.
00:41:55.882: >> I HAVE 12 DOCUMENTS OPEN RIGHT NOW AND SO I'M JUST MOVING THROUGH THEM.
00:42:00.053: >> Chair Mills: GREAT. COMMISSIONER DISCH?
00:42:10.063: >> Councilmember Disch: I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR MORE ABOUT THE STAFF RATIONALE FOR THE APPROVAL OF THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE. I DO FEEL WHILE IT IS NOT SUBJECT TO -- WELL, NOBODY IS SUBJECT TO TC-1 ZONING UNLESS THEY WANT TO BE AT THIS MOMENT. GRANTING THIS USE MOVES AWAY FROM THE DIRECTION WE ARE TRYING TO GO BY CREATING THAT DESIGNATION. AND I WASN'T FULLY PERSUADED BY THE PETITIONER'S ARGUMENT THAT THEY DON'T HAVE A DRIVE THRU AT THEIR OTHER SITE. AND UNLESS I MISUNDERSTOOD SOMETHING. AND SO THIS WAS -- THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT THEY FELT THEIR PATRONS WOULD WANT AND ALSO THEY MADE A STRONG COVID ARGUMENT. AND I RECALL US TALKING ABOUT COVID MAKING US HAVE DIFFERENT FEELINGS ABOUT DRIVE THRUS THAN WE ALL HAD TWO DECADES AGO OR WHENEVER IT WAS THAT THE PANDEMIC STARTED. I AM NOT NECESSARILY OPPOSED TO. BUT WANT TO THOROUGHLY EXAMINE THAT BEFORE WE VOTE ON IT. I SHOULDN'T SAY THAT --
00:43:51.498: >> Chair Mills: I HEARD THAT DIRECTED TO STAFF. I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I SEE THE PETITIONER'S STAFF. AND COMMISSIONER DISCH IF YOU WOULD LIKE THE PETITIONER TO RESPOND, YOU ARE WELCOME TO INVITE THAT BUT LET'S GO TO STAFF FIRST.
00:44:07.213: >> YES. SO I THINK IT WAS PRETTY WAS PRY MENTIONED, THE FIVE ITEMS AS PART OF THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE. THE FIRST ONE, WILL BE CONSISTENT WITH THE GENERAL OBJECTIVES OF THE MASTER PLAN. SO IT DOES RECOMMEND RETAIL COMMERCIAL USES GENERALLY AS FAR AS THE MASTER PLAN. NUMBER TWO, WILL BE DESIGNED, CONSTRUCTED AND OPERATED AND MAINTAINED IN A MANNER THAT'S COMPATIBLE WITH THE EXISTING AND PLANNED CHARACTER OF THE GENERAL VICINITY. CLEARLY THERE'S A LOT OF BANKS IN THIS AREA AND THERE'S A LOT DRIVE THRUS, WHETHER IT'S BANKS OR FAST FOOD. AND CONSISTENT WITH THE GENERAL NEIGHBORHOOD, DESIGN, SCALE, AND BULK AND THE INTENSITY AND THE CHARACTER OF THE ACTIVITY. I RECALL THAT THE PREVIOUS SUBMITTAL WAS WITH EITHER THREE OR FOUR DRIVE THRU LANES. THIS HE CAME BACK AND REDUCED THEM WITH TWO AND THEY ADDED MORE BICYCLE PARKING. WILL NOT BE DETRIMENTAL TO THE USE, PEACEFUL ENJOYMENT, ECONOMIC VALUE OR DEVELOPMENT OF NEIGHBORING PROPERTY, OR THE NEIGHBORHOOD AREA IN GENERAL. THERE'S A 100-FOOT BUFFER AND THERE'S NO CONNECTION BETWEEN THESE TWO SITES AS FAR AS A CUT THRU FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD. IT'S REALLY QUITE SEPARATE. THIS IS MORE AUTO ORIENTED, BUT IT DOES ALSO HAVE US ABOUT STOPS, SIDEWALKS, BICYCLE LANES. AND THEN FINALLY IT SAYS WILL HAVE A DETRIMENTAL SECT ON THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT. THERE'S NO NATURAL FEATURES BEING IMPACTED ON THIS SITE. WE CAN HAVE THAT CONVERSATION ON ALL FIVE OF THOSE POINTS AND MAYBE THERE'S MORE INFORMATION I COULD ADD FOR SOME BACKGROUND. AND IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S POSSIBLE WHEN IT'S OPEN THAT THE PETITIONER ALSO HAS HIS HAND UP AND MAY BE ABLE TO ELABORATE.
00:45:59.926: >> Chair Mills: COMMISSIONER DISCH, YOU ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT OUR DISCUSSION AROUND COVID AND SOME OF THE OTHERS. DID --
00:46:05.465: >> Councilmember Disch: I MENTIONED THOSE THINGS LARGELY BY WAY OF  OF PROMPTING OTHER COMMISSIONERS FOR WHAT OUR CONDITIONS WERE. THESE A THROUGH E CONDITIONS, THEY ARE HELPFUL AND I APPRECIATE THEM. I DON'T THINK THEY GET AT THE CONCERN THAT IS BEING RAISED ABOUT FACILITATING MORE ALL TOE CENTRICITY. -- AUTO CENTRICITY, IF THAT'S A WORD. I SO I WOULD BE HAPPY TO HEAR FROM THE PETITIONER.
00:46:41.467: >> YEAH, HE MAY -- OR THE TEAM MAY HAVE MORE INFORMATION ON -- THEY MAY HAVE SOME COVID-RELATED NUMBERS AS FAR AS TRAFFIC INCREASES AT DRIVE THRUS MAYBE SINCE THE PANDEMIC IN THE LAST 16, 17 MONTHS. SO THAT M BE HELPF I HE HAS SOME BKGUNDUT UNTIL HE'S CALLED UPON, WE CANAIT AND SEE.
00:47:00.153: >> Councilmember Disch: I'M HAPPY TO INVITE HIS PARTICIPATION. THANK YOU, MR. CHENG, VERY MUCH.
00:47:05.925: >> Chair Mills: GO AHEAD HAVERA. I WILL ADDRESS SOME OF IT AND DAVID SASS MAY HAVE SOME OF THE ACTUAL DATA. ONE THE THINGS WE ASKED MR. SHASTA TO DO IS OUTLINE THE WAY THEY HAVE SEEN COVID IMPACT THEIR BUSINESS AND MOVING FORWARD. SO THEIR CURRENT FACILITY, AS YOU ARE CORRECT, MS. DISCH, DOES NOT HAVE A DRIVE THRU. THEY POLLED THEIR CUSTOMERS IN THE AREA AND FOUND THERE IS A STRONG DESIRE TO HAVE A DRIVE THRU. THEY HAVE FOUND THAT MUCH LIKE A GREAT DEAL OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT FOR A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF TIME, THEY HAD TO DO BUSINESS THROUGH A DRIVE THRU DUE TO THE PANDEMIC. I KNOW THAT MY FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, IT DOES NOT HAVE A DRIVE THRU AND I GO INTO THE -- INTO THE FACILITY EVERY TIME THAT I GO IN BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO BE SOCIAL -- YOU KNOW, CLOSE TO PEOPLE IF I DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO. THAT MAY -- THIS MAY BE WITH US FOR, YOU KNOW, STILL SOMETIME. THERE MAY BE ANOTHER PANDEMIC AS WELL IN THE FUTURE AND A LOT OF BUSINESSES THAT DID SURVIVE THROUGH THE PANDEMIC WERE THOSE THAT HAD AND UTILIZED DRIVE THRUS. I HAVE THINK THE OTHER IMPORTANT FACTOR, IN REGARDS TO THE CLIMATE ACTION PLAN IS THAT AS YOU ARE SEEING MORE AND MORE ELECTRIC VEHICLES, THAT PEOPLE ARE STILL -- AS PART OF THIS PANDEMIC HAVE DEVELOPED THIS ROUTINE AND THIS HABIT, IF YOU WILL OF HOW THEY CONDUCT THEIR BUSINESS. I HAVE AN ELECTRIC VEHICLE MYSELF. I PREFER TO GO TO DRIVE THRUS AS MUCH AS I CAN VERSUS HAVING TO GET OUT OF MY VEHICLE AND GO INTO A RESTAURANT, IF I DON'T HAVE TO. AGAIN, ALL COVID RELATED. SO I THINK COVID HAS COMPLETELY UPENDED A LOT OF THINKING, I FEEL, AROUND HOW WE HAVE TO LOOK AT DRIVE THRUS IN REGARDS TO THE GREATER, YOU KNOW -- THE GREATER HEALTH AND SAFETY OF OUR COMMUNITY. SO, I DON'T KNOW, DAVID, IF YOU HAVE ANY, YOU KNOW, MORE SPECIFIC DATA IF YOU WOULD -- [ GARBLED AUDIO ] DAVID?
00:49:36.075: >> MR. SASS?
00:49:36.409: >> I DIDN'T KNOW THAT I COULD UNMUTE MYSELF. NOT ONLY DID WE SEE, WHAT SEAN HAS REFERRED TO, THAT WE HAD REMAINED DRIVE THRU ONLY FOR MANY, MANY MONTHS, PROBABLY CLOSER TO 10 TO 11 MONTHS, JUST DRIVE THRU ONLY. THAT'S CHANGED CONSUMER HABITS COMPLETELY. THE PEOPLE THAT GENERALLY WERE -- TRUST ME, WE ARE IN AREAS THAT WERE MORE, I WILL SAY WALK-UP. WE'RE IN VERY SMALL CITIES UP IN THE THUMB, THEY WERE WALKING UP AND DEALING WITH YOUR BANKER WAS GENERALLY PART OF THE DAY. WE'RE SEEING CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF DRIVE THRU TRAFFIC JUST IN THOSE AREAS AS WELL. I DON'T HAVE SPECIFIC NUMBERS BUT I WOULD BE WILLING TO BET OVER HALF THE PEOPLE THAT USED TO WALK UP ARE USING DRIVE THRUS ONLY BECAUSE THEY SAW THIS AS A CONVENIENCE AND THEY COULD STILL SEE THEIR BANKER, SO TO SPEAK, BUT ALSO HAVE THE CONVENIENCE OF DRIVING THROUGH AND TAKING LESS TIME TO -- OUT OF THEIR DAY TO CONDUCT A TRANSACTION. I DON'T SEE THIS CHANGING. THIS IS INDUSTRYWIDE. WE LOOK AT DATA ALL THE TIME, AS FAR AS WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE. WE ARE NOT THE ONLY BANK IN THE AREA OR THE ONLY BANK IN THE NATION THAT'S EXPERIENCING THIS. THIS IS DEFINITELY INDUSTRYWIDE. WE TOOK IN CONSIDERATION THE FACT THAT THIS AREA IS OPPOSED TO DRIVE THRUS AND WE ORIGINALLY HAD THREE. WE KNOCKED IT DOWN TO TWO WHILE MAKING A MULTIPURPOSE LANE NOT ONLY FOR IT TO BE MANNED BUT ALSO TO BE AN ATM AS WELL ON THE WALL. IT'S A LITTLE MORE INCONVENIENT FOR US, SURE, BUT WE ARE WILLING TO DO THAT FOR THE CITY AND THEIR CAUSE. SO I DON'T SEE THIS CHANGING. AS SEAN ALLUDED TO, AS FAR AS THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT, PEOPLE WILL EVENTUALLY PROBABLY BE DRIVING ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND THOSE ELECTRIC VEHICLES WILL BE GOING THROUGH DRIVE THRUS. I DON'T SEE COMBUSTION ENGINES LASTING THE NEXT 50 YEARS. SO AGAIN, WE INTEND TO BE IN THIS COMMUNITY FOR 50 YEARS OR MORE. WE HAVE NO DESIRE TO BE ANYWHERE ELSE. OUR CUSTOMERS HAVE BEEN ASKING FOR A DRIVE THRU, BOTH COMMERCIAL AND OUR RETAIL CUSTOMERS. I THINK IT'S NECESSARY TO HAVE A DRIVE THRU IN THIS TYPE OF OPERATION. GOD FORBID WE HAVE ANOTHER PANDEMIC, OTHERWISE WE HAD TO SHUT DOWN RETAIL CENTERS JUST BECAUSE OF THAT. SO --
00:52:34.587: >> Chair Mills: COMMISSION DISCH.
00:52:35.855: >> Councilmember Disch: NO, I CEDE THE FLOOR.
00:52:37.857: >> Chair Mills: YOU CAN DO THAT. WE'RE NOT QUITE THAT FORMAL. COMMISSIONER CLARKE, GO AHEAD.
00:52:42.295: >> Commissioner Clarke: THANK YOU. SO I HAVE TO SAY I'M I'M A BIT SKEPTICAL TO THIS CONTRIBUTING TO OUR MASTER PLAN. I THINK THAT'S REALLY THE KEYWORD IS THE OBJECTIVES OF THE MASTER PLAN, IT'S ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE DEVELOPMENT AND NOT WHAT CURRENTLY STANDS THERE. JUST BECAUSE DRIVE THRUS ARE WHAT ARE THERE, AND THE OBJECTIVE OF THE MASTER PLAN OF BEING MORE WALKABLE AND MORE CONNECTED NEIGHBORHOODS, THIS WORKS DIRECTLY AGAINST IT. IT'S LESS THAN 400 FEET FROM A FAIRLY DENSE RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD, DIRECTLY BEHIND IT. PUTTING NOT GUILTY A DRIVE THROUGH WOULD POTENTIALLY SEPARATE THAT NEIGHBORHOOD FURTHER FROM THE COMMERCIAL CORRIDOR AND OTHER SERVICES LIKE THE FAMILY ORIENTED THINGS LIKE THE GOLD FISH SWIM SCHOOL DIRECTLY ACROSS THE STREET AND HAVING TO WALK THROUGH A DRIVE THRU TO GET THERE, KIND OF MISERABLE. AND IT'S RIGHT NEXT TO THE Z ALZAL DEGROTTO WHERE THERE ARE LOTS OF EVENTS. THAT A COMMUNITY-ORIENTED BUSINESS. RIGHT NEXT TO A VACANT PARCEL FOR NOW, AND THEN A DRIVE THRU, IT TAKES IT IN THE DIRECTION THAT I DO THINK IS DIRECTLY CONTRADICTING TO THE OBJECTIVES OF THE MASTER PLAN, AND WE MADE SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS OF DRIVE THREWS THRUS REQUIRING A SPECIAL EXCEPTION. THAT WAS IN LINE BECAUSE IT'S NOT PART OF THE MASTER PLAN AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON THIS. FINALLY, MY LAST POINT, THIS IS DEFINED AS A SIGNATURE TRANSIT CORRIDOR AND A FOCUS CORRIDOR IN THE TRANSPORTATION PLANNING DOCUMENT. AND IT IDENTIFIES IT SPECIFICALLY AS THE PRIMARY AREAS FOR INCREASING PUBLIC TRANSIT. ADDING MORE CURB CULTS AND PEOPLE COMING IN AND OUT THROUGH DRIVE THRU WILL SLOW DOWN TRAFFIC ALONG A KEY ROUTE THAT WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE INCREASING ROUTES PER DAY ON BUSES. THAT DIRECTLY CONTRADICTS ALL THE GOALS IN THE TRANSPORTATION PLAN. I THINK THERE'S A NUMBER OF REASREASONS. AND IT'S PROPOSED AS A MAJOR ROUTE, AND PUTTING IN A DRIVE THRU WITH TRAFFIC COMING AND GOING IS INCONSISTENT. IF WE ARE TALKING 50 YEARS IN ADVANCE, I'M GOING TO GUESS THAT A DRIVE THRU IS NOT AS RELEVANT AS MOBILE BANKING. IT'S A LARGE DIFFICULT SITE WITH A DRIVE THRU THAT'S INCONSISTENT WITH OUR MASTER PLAN.
00:55:28.694: >> Chair Mills: THANK YOU VERY MUCH, COMMISSIONER CLARKE. OTHER QUESTIONS, DISCUSSION FROM COMMISSIONERS? COMMISSIONER WYCHE. SORRY. IT WILL TAKE ME A MINUTE.
00:55:45.544: >> CAN YOU HEAR ME. I SWITCHED MY MICROPHONE. A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS AND THANK YOU, COMMISSIONER CLARKE BECAUSE YOU COVERED ALMOST EVERYTHING THAT I WAS GOING TO ATTEMPT TO SAY, BUT YOU SAID IT WAY BETTER. SO I APPRECIATE GOING AFTER YOU. A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FOR STAFF, ONE, CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT DISTRICT THIS PROPOSAL IS IN NOW?
00:56:12.137: >> C2B WHICH IS THE BUSINESS SERVICE DISTRICT.
00:56:15.174: >> OKAY. C2B.
00:56:17.343: >> WITH THE ZONING DESIGNATION.
00:56:19.545: >> YEP. AND THEN I WANTED -- ANOTHER QUESTION FOR STAFF, IS THERE ANY RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THIS DEVELOPMENT AND SITE WITH THE DRIVE THROUGH RELATED TO THE PARKING? SO I SAW THAT THERE WAS, I THINK MORE PARKING THAN IT WAS REDUCED AND THEN THE BIKING WAS INCREASED AND I WONDERED IF THERE'S STILL 52 PARKING SPACES IN THE REQUEST FOR THE DRIVE THROUGH, WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE NEED FOR THAT MANY PARKING SPACES AND THE CHARGEMENT OF THE PETITIONER THAT THE BUSINESS IS GOING TO BE LARGELY CONDUCTED THROUGH A DRIVE THROUGH STRUCTURE, THOSE THINGS SEEM TO BE AT ODDS WITH EACH OTHER. I WILL PAUSE THERE TO SEE.
00:57:09.428: >> THE MINIMUM IS 55 SPACES AND THE MAXIMUM IS 57. WE HAVE' RANGE, WHICH WILL BE BANK AND OFFICE. SO THE QUESTION BEING WITH THE DRIVE THRU RELATED IF THEY ARE USING THE DRIVE THRU, THEY ARE ENTERING AND EXITING THE SITE BUT THAT'S MORE FOR THE EMPLOYEES AND THE SECOND FLOOR WILL BE USED FOR OFFICE SPACE. THEY DO HAVE ADDITIONAL 6 OR 7,000 SQUARE FEET THAT'S ABOVE THE BANK.
00:57:40.292: >> AND ARE THERE ANY PROVISIONS IN THE UNIFIED CODE THAT REQUIRE US TO REQUIRE AND EXHAUST CAPTURE SYSTEM FOR IDLING OF A VEHICLE IN A DRIVE THRU.
00:57:51.103: >> WE HAVE AN IDLING ORDINANCE BUT I'M NOT AWARE OF ANYTHING THAT AS YOU QUEUE AND GO THROUGH THE ORDINANCE, THAT THERE'S ANYTHING IN THE CITY ORDINANCE.
00:57:59.578: >> AND THERE ISN'T ANY PROVISION FOR US IN THE CITY ORDINANCE TO REQUIRE SOME KIND OF EXHAUST CAPTURE FOR CARS THAT WOULD BE SITTING AND IDLING?
00:58:10.155: >> NO, ALTHOUGH WE ARE PROMOTING ELECTRICAL VEHICLES YOU CAN SEE THROUGH THE PARKING CHARGING STATIONS THERE, BUT THERE IS NOT.
00:58:17.696: >> OKAY. THANK YOU.
00:58:23.669: >> Chair Mills: COMMISSIONER SAUVE.
00:58:26.672: >> Commissioner Sauve: I'M LOOKING THROUGH THE PLANS AND I DON'T SEE A CAR QUEUE. SO PER THE ENGINEERING, I GUESS I WILL GO TO MIDWEST IF SOMEONE COULD ANSWER THIS. HOW MANY CARS CAN QUEUE UP BEFORE THE ACCESS TO THE PARKING LOT IS OBSTRUCTED?
00:58:51.397: >> I GUESS I WILL TRY TO ANSWE AT ONE. FORE THE ACCS TO THE PARKING LOT IS OBSUCTE SO THAT WOULD BE THROUGHHE -- THE SINE, E DIRECTIONURB CUTHAT' ALSO FOR THAT ADDITIONAL PARKING HEAR. SO THAT ADDITIONAL PARKING, IF THERE WERE CARED QUEUED UP, THEY WOULD BE -- CARS QUEUED UP, THEY WOULD BE ACCESSIBLE THROUGH THE OTHER ACCESS POINT BUT TO PROBABLY ANSWER THE INTENT OF YOUR QUESTION, I BELIEVE THERE'S ENOUGH FOR TWO CARS IN EACH OF THOSE DRIVE THRU LANES.
00:59:38.544: >> Commissioner Sauve: I MEAN THAT'S SIGNIFICANTLY CONCERNING OBSERVING DRIVE ENTHUSIASMS IN THE AREA. IF YOU SEE A FRIDAY AT A DRIVE THRU BANK, PEOPLE TRYING TO CASH CHECKS AND THINGS, THEY QUEUE UP AROUND THE BLOCK. I KNOW THE ONE AT THE CORNER QUEUES UP OUT INTO THE SHARED PARKING LOT OF A RETAIL CENTER. I HAVE WITNESSED OTHERS ALONG STADIUM QUEUE UP OUT ON TO STADIUM AND THEN QUEUE IN THE BIKE LANE OBSTRUCTING THE BIKE LANE AND THE RIGHT VEHICLE LANE. IT'S SIGNIFICANTLY CONCERNING TO ME. THE LIMITED QUEUE AND THEN HOW FAR IT WILL BACK UP FOR ANYBODY TRYING TO ACCESS BOTH THE PARKING LOSS AND ADDITIONAL DRIVE THROUGH SPACE AND THEN BLOCKING THE CORRIDOR, ESPECIALLY THE BIKE LANE. IF WE ARE REALLY TRYING TO TOWARDS ALTERNATIVE MODES OF TRANSPORTATION, QUEUING IN THE BIKE LANE DOES NOT MEET THE GOALS OF HAVING AN ADVERSE EFFECT. AND I CAN SEE THE CARS OVERHANGING INTO THE SIDEWALKS AND BIKE LANES. UNLESS THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT REVISION TO EVEN JUST HOW IT QUEUES ALONG WITH COMMISSIONers' CLARKE WELL ARTICULATED ARGUMENTS ABOUT THIS, I CAN'T SEE A DEFINANCE TO HOW IT SITUATES. AND I THINK THE OTHER THING WITH HABITS CHANGING VIA COVID. NOT ALL HABITS ARE GOOD HABITS. WE NEED TO BREAK BAD HABITS. THINK THINK WHAT WE ARE DOING WITH TC-1 AND MOVING FORWARD. IT'S HARD TO BREAK BAD HABITS BUT THEY ARE WORTH DOING. I DIDN'T SEE ANY SIGNIFICANT SUSTAINABILITY METRICS MET HERE. THEY WERE LOOKING FORWARD TO DISCUSSING ABOUT COMPOSTING AND COULDN'T DO SOLAR PANELS AND LOW FLUSH TOILETS THEY ARE BASELINE AT THIS POINT. IF WE ARE NOT DOING SIGNIFICANT SUSTAINABILITY MEMBERS AND NOT PROTECTING MULTIPLE TRANSIT OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN THESE NEIGHBORHOODS, IT'S VERY CONCERNING THE ARGUMENTS MADE SEEM TO MORE TO HABITS AND BASELINE. HERE WE ARE NOT VETTING WHAT THE BUSINESS MODEL IS. WE'RE LOOKING AT PLANNING STANDARDS AND, YOU KNOW, EVERY BUILDING WE LOOK AT 50 YEARS IN THE FUTUREA AND, YOU KNOW, I CAN'T SEE HOW THIS IS A BENEFIT IN 50 YEARS IN THE FUTURE AND HOW THIS REALLY IMPACTS OUR COMMUNITY IN AWE P A POSITIVE WH OUR MASTER PLAN GOALS. I. THINK THAT'S WHERE I STAND RIGHT NOW. THANKS.
01:02:14.933: >> Chair Mills: COMMISSIONER SAUVE, DID YOU NEED ANYTHING ELSE FROM THE ENGINEERING TEAM?
01:02:18.470: >> Commissioner Sauve: THANK YOU. THAT WAS HELPFUL.
01:02:20.105: >> Chair Mills: I WAS GOING TO SAY, I HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS THAT I WILL GET TO ON THAT, BUT MR. HIRSCH, JUST SO YOU KNOW, BUT I WILL CALL ON OTHER COMMISSIONERS FIRST. I CAN'T REMEMBER WHO I SAW FIRST, COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT, COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL AND I WILL COME BACK TO YOU COMMISSIONER WYCHE.
01:02:47.232: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: MY INTERNET IS TERRIBLE. TWO QUESTIONS, I THINK, DIRECTED AT STAFF FOR NOW. I THINK I'M LOOKING AT THIS CORRECTLY. THE BANK DRIVE THROUGH WOULD REQUIRE AN ADDITIONAL CURB CUT THAT'S NOT CURRENTLY ON THE SITE; IS THAT CORRECT?
01:03:02.648: >> WOW, I KNOW THEY HAVE A ONE WAY DRIVE THAT'S PROPOSED AND IT WILL EXIT. ARE THIS THEY CLOSING UP A CURB CUT.
01:03:11.123: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: NO, LOOKING AT --
01:03:13.458: >> IT WILL BE SHARED WITH THE FUTURE USE. IN ALL LIKELIHOOD, THERE WILL ONLY BE TWO, BUT THEY MAY BE DOING A CURB CUT. LET ME LOOK AT THE SITE PLAN. & MY OTHER QUESTION IS ALSO FOR YOU. I'M CURIOUS. I THOUGH THAT -- THE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE PETITIONER HAVE BEEN IN THE WORK FOR A WHILE, ALTHOUGH WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT TC-1 FOR A WHILE. I'M CURIOUS IF TC-1 AND THE FACT THAT WE ARE REZONING ARE CREATING THIS DISTRICT REZONING IF THIS FACTORED IN ANY OF THE CONVERSATIONS THAT YOU HAD WITH THE PETITIONER.
01:03:49.728: >> WE HAD A BRIEF DISCUSSION ABOUT THE TC-1, BUT THEY MOVED IN ORDER WITH THIS PROPOSAL.
01:04:02.407: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: I DON'T WANT TO REHASH WHAT COMMISSIONER CLARKE ELOQUENTLY AND ADDING ANOTHER CURB CUT, IF I'M LOOKING AT IT CORRECTLY WHICH I THINK I AM. THAT'S DETRIMENTAL TO PEDESTRIANS. SOME HABITS ARE NOT GOOD HABITS LIKE ENCOURAGING MORE DRIVING BEHAVIOR, ALTHOUGH, YOU KNOW, POTENTIALLY RIGHT NOW, THAT MAY BE SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE ARE MORE COMFORTABLE DOING AND THAT CREATES OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES. WE ARE TRYING TO GET PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR CARS AND NOT STAYING IN THEIR CARS. I WOULD LIKE CONFIRMATION ON WHETHER OR NOT THAT EXTRA CURB CUT, MR. CHENG, IS WHAT I'M SEEING, BUT THAT ALONE, I THINK IS ESSENTIALLY A REASON TO DENY THIS.
01:04:51.857: >> IN LOOKING AT IT -- I'M JUST LOOKING AT THE PICTURE AND I CAN BRING IT UP ALSO, THEY HAVE A SHARED CURB CUT WITH THE ZELGAS CLUB THAT'S JUST TO THE NORTH THERE. SO IT'S -- I WOULD ALMOST SAY IT'S ONE AND A HALF CURB CUTS THERE. IT'S A SHARED CURB CUT WITH A PROPERTY TO THE NORTH.
01:05:11.309: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: I'M LOOKING ON GOOGLE MAPS, EXACTLY WHERE IT LOOKS LIKE FROM THE SITE PLAN THE DRIVE THRU WOULD BE, THE ENTRANCE TO IT, IT LOOKS LIKE RIGHT NOW, IT'S A CURB.
01:05:22.621: >> YES. THAT WOULD BE CORRECT.
01:05:26.691: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: SO THEY HAVE TO CREATE A NEW CURB CUT IN ORDER TO DO THIS PLAN?
01:05:30.328: >> THAT IS CORRECT.
01:05:32.130: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU.
01:05:35.801: >> Chair Mills: COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL.
01:05:37.135: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: I GUESS I AM NOT WILD ABOUT THE GRANTING THE SPECIAL EX'EMION USE BUT -- EXEMPTION USE, BUT THE BANK IS PART OF THE COMMERCIAL CORRIDOR. I DON'T THINK THERE'S -- I DON'T THINK THERE'S AN ISSUE WITH THAT. I THINK THAT RIGHT NOW THE ZONING IS WHAT IT IS. AND WE HAVE TO WORK WITHIN THAT. IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE CAN'T SHOOT TOWARDS THINGS. I DON'T THINK WE CAN DENY IT BASES ON, YOU KNOW, WHAT IT ISN'T RIGHT NOW. I WOULD SAY THAT STADIUM, UP AND DOWN THE WHOLE BASIS OF IT, WHEN IT WAS PLANNED LONG AGO, WAS HAVING TWO DRIVEWAYS PER LOT. AND THAT'S THE PATTERN UP AND DOWN AND IT'S PART OF WHAT MAKES IT TRICKY TO BIKE AND WALK THERE. SO THAT'S THE PATTERN THAT'S THERE. IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE NEED TO REPEAT THE PATTERN BUT I GUESS WHAT I WOULD SAY IS WHO DESIGNS TOO, IT'S HARD TO HAVE A SINGLE CURB CUT WITH THE FIRE TRUCK REQUIREMENTS THAT WE HAVE FOR THE CITY TOO. THEY REQUIRE A BIG FAT TURNAROUND AND IT'S PRETTY HARD TO MAKE THAT WORK WITHOUT THAT. SO THIS MAY BE ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE, LIKE, OUR STANDARDS IN ONE AREA ARE IN CONFLICT IN SOME WAYS WITH THE WAY THAT WE WANT THINGS TO BE. AND SO I THINK THAT'S -- IT'S PRETTY TOUGH TO MAKE THAT WORK. SO IT'S -- THAT'S JUST SOMETHING TO KEEP IN MIND, I THINK IN TERMS OF THE CURB CUT QUESTION. I QUESTION I HAVE, AND I THINK THIS IS FOR COMMISSIONER MILLS IS ABOUT THE SOLAR. AND SO, YOU KNOW, FOR MY RESIDENTIAL SOLAR, IF I'M DOING THINGS DURING THE DAY, AND I'M GENERATING ENERGY DURING THE DAY, I GET THAT AT MY FULL RATE. IF I'M DOING -- IF I'M USING MY DRYER AT NIGHT AND I'M PULLING IT OFF THE GRID, THAT'S WHEN I GET THE REDUCED RATE THAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT THEIR LETTER. AND WHAT I'M WONDER IF FOR COMMERCIAL, IF IT'S DIFFERENT. THIS IS A BANK. IT'S NOT GOING TO BE OPEN AT 10:00 AT NIGHT. SO IS THERE ANY REASON WHY THEY WOULDN'T GET THE FULL BENEFIT OF THEIR -- OF THEIR KIND OF INVESTED SOLAR DOLLAR IF THEY ARE OPERATING DURING DAYTIME HOURS THAT THEY WOULDN'T GET -- IT STINKS. IT REALLY DOES, THOSE OF US -- IT'S NOT A GREAT SITUATION THAT D.T.E. HAS REDUCED THAT DIFFERENCE. BUT DOES IT WORK THE SAME WAY WITH COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS IN TERMS OF IF THEY HAVE -- YOU KNOW, IF THEY ARE OPERATING AT NOON AND THEY HAVE ALL OF THEIR COMPUTERS ON AND LIGHTS ON AND IT'S MOVING AND SHAKING IN THERE, THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET THEIR FULL INVESTMENT OUT OF THAT SOLAR, CORRECT? AM I RIGHT ABOUT THAT?
01:08:42.721: >> Chair Mills: YES. SO THE IDEA ABOUT HOW WE DON'T HAVE TRUE NET METERING. WHEN YOU HAVE EXCESS POW'er FROM YOUR PANELS IT DOESN'T WORK IN REVERSE. YOU SELL IT BACK TO THE UTILITY FOR A SMALLER AMOUNT OF MONEY THAN WHAT YOU HAVE TO BUY THOSE SAME ELECTRONS LATER ON. IT'S NO DIFFERENT FOR COMMERCIAL. AND MY HAUNCH WAS THE SAME AS YOURS, JUST THAT THE TIME THAT THEY WOULD BE USING IT, WOULD BE BETTER MATCHED THAN MORE OF THEIR USAGES DURING THE DAY THAN WHAT A HOUSEHOLD WOULD BE. DURING THE "SUN TIMES." A LOT OF THIS TOO, JUST DEPENDS HOW MUCH POWER THEY ARE GOING TO BE USING. AND SO, RIGHT, LIKE IN -- IN TERMS OF HOW MANY SOLAR PANELS AND SO THEY WOULD BE USING A WHOLE LOT MORE OF IT IF IT WERE THREE STORIES JUST BECAUSE IT'S THE SAME ROOF SPACE, BUT MORE FLOOR AREA AND SO MORE USAGE. AND SO YOU JUST WOULDN'T -- YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO, YOU KNOW -- AS A PERCENTAGE, YOU WOULDN'T BE USING AS MUCH OF YOUR OWN POWER BECAUSE, LIKE, IT -- WE'RE GENERATING -- GENERATING AS MUCH OF YOUR POWER BUT YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT SELLING IT BACK TO THE GRID IF YOU CAN USE EVERYTHING THAT YOU ARE GENERATING AT THAT TIME. I DON'T GET INTO THE DETAILS OF ALL OF THAT, BUT IT OPERATES, COMMISSIONER GIBB ANDAL TO YOUR QUESTION, VERY SIMILAR TO HOW YOUR HOUSE OPERATES OR SHOULD.
01:10:08.940: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: AY. OKAY. SO I GUESS I WOULD BE CURIOUS TO HEAR FROM THE PETITIONER ABOUT THAT BECAUSE IT SEEMS -- IT DOESN'T SEEM COMPLETELY -- IF FEELS A LITTLE DISINGENUOUS ABOUT HOW IT'S WRITTEN IN THE LETTER AND I KNOW IT'S AN INVESTMENT, BUT LIKE FOR MY HOUSE, WHICH I KNOW IS AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT SITUATION, AFTER TEN YEARS, I'M NOT YING -- YOU KNOW, I'M NOT IT'S ALL -- SO IT'S AN INVESTMENT, BUT THEN IT PAYS OFF. AND SO I'M JUST WONDERING, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU ALL REALLY LOOKED AT IT, HOW DID IT BREAK DOWN FOR YOU IN TERMS OF THAT, BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW, THE LETTER JUST FEELS LIKE A BIG -- LIKE THE'S JUST -- IT'S JUST LIKE MAKING EXCUSES FOR EVERYTHING IS WHAT READ I AS. IT FELT LIKE SOR OF JUSFYING CEPT FOR E.V. CHARGING AND THINGS THAT ARE TYPALLY DON IN BUIINGS AWA IT -- I DON'T KNOW. IT --- IT DN'T LOOK LIKE IT WASRYING THINGSN, A MORE MI UP WITH EXCES. SO I -- TT'Y -- THAT'S MY SENSE OF HOW I READ IT. AND I'M CURIOUS HOW THE SOLAR THING BROKE OUT. I WOULD BE CURIOUS TO H HEAR FRM THE PETITIONER.
01:11:35.860: >> YES, LOOKING AT THE ROOF, YOU NEED A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF ROOF IN ORDER FOR THE ECONOMICS TO MAKE SENSE. AND WITH THE ROOF TOP EQUIPMENT THAT'S CURRENTLY UP THERE RIGHT NOW, IT DOESN'T LEAVE VERY MUCH SIGNIFICANTLY MUCH ROOM UP THERE IN ORDER TO GET A SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF PANELS AND THAT'S JUST THE RAFA REALITY OF THIS SITUAT. IF YOU FEEL IT'S DISINGENUOUS, YOU DO HAVE TO HAVE A PERSON AMOUNT OF AREA TO MAKE THOSE PANELS MAKE ECONOMIC SENSE AND SO, YOU KNOW, THEY JUST DID NOT MAKE ECONOMIC SENSE FOR US.
01:12:11.529: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: WHAT WAS THE PAYBACK HOE? THEY USUALLY GIVE YOU A RETURN ON INVESTMENT IN TERMS OF YEARS.
01:12:18.937: >> I DON'T KNOW OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD, SHANNON.
01:12:21.105: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: MM-HMM. SO I GUESS I -- I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT BEING A BANK. I'M NOT WILD ABOUT THE DRIVE THRU THING. COVID HAS ADDED -- IT'S NOT QUITE AS BLACK AND WHITE IN MY MIND, AS IT WAS BEFORE COVID. I THINK COMMISSIONER DISCH WAS SORT OF ASKING FOR OUR HONEST OPINIONS ABOUT THIS THAT I FEEL A LITTLE MORE GRAY ON IT NOW IN SOME WAYS. BUT I DO FEEL LIKE IN TERMS OF LONG TERM -- THE DIRECTION THAT WE WANT TO BE HEADING IS SOMEWHERE DIFFERENT AND I GOOD HE IS WHAT I WOULD SAY, IN TERMS OF THE PROJECT, I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT BEING SLICED OFF OF THE BOTTOM. I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT BEING NEXT TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD. I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT BEING A BANK. I THINK I DO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT BEING A DRIVE THRU AND I GUESS I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME MORE ON SUSTAINABILITY. SO THAT WHERE I AM ON THE PROJECT RIGHT NOW.
01:13:32.043: >> Chair Mills: COMMISSIONER WYCHE.
01:13:35.213: >> ANOTHER QUESTION FOR STAFF: SO BEAR WITH ME AS I GET UP TO SPEED WITH ALL THE TERMINOLOGY. IF I HEARD YOU CORRECTLY, THIS IS IN C3 DISTRICT; IS THAT CORRECT? NO. WHICH DISTRICT?
01:13:47.725: >> C2B WHICH IS SOMEWHAT SIMILAR -- SO C2B, BUT THE REAR 100 FEET IT'S ZONED P FOR PARKING WHICH IS A BUFFER THERE.
01:13:59.404: >> GREAT. THANK YOU. AS I'M LOOKING AT THE UDC AND I'M NOW IN THE RIGHT PLACE, THERE IN WHATEVER THIS IS, THIS IS C SECTION 2, SUBSECTION B, IN THE C2B DISTRICT, THE DRIVE THRU FACILITY MAY BE LOCATED BETWEEN A STREET AND A PHYSICAL BUILDING. ON THE SITE OR THE PEDESTRIAN CIRCULATION ON AND OFF THE SITE. SO MY QUESTION IS HOW DOES THAT SECTION PERTAIN TO BIKES? AND BIKERS ARE THE BIKERS CONSIDERED INSIDE THE VEHICULAR DEFINITION OR ARE THEY PICKED UP IN ANOTHER PLAN THAT I HAVE TO PULL UP?
01:14:59.597: >> I DON'T THINK I CAUGHT THE LAST SENTENCE, BUT AT LEAST THE BEGINNING PART, I WAS THINKING -- I THINK IT WAS PREVIOUS BROUGHT UP HOW MANY CARS WOULD QUEUE, THE DRIVE THRU CANNOT BE IN THE FRONT OF THE BUILDING. IT'S NOT. IT'S BEHIND BUILDING, BUT IF IT QUEUES UP AND WERE TO BLOCK EITHER ONCOMING THE SIDEWALK OR THE BICYCLE LANE, THEN THERE WOULD DEFINITELY BE AN ISSUE.
01:15:25.089: >> AND DO WE HAVE AN ANSWER -- GO AHEAD, BRETT, I WILL WAIT BEFORE I ANSWER MY NEXT QUESTION.
01:15:31.129: >> Planning Manager:  NO, NO, IT'S  A GOOD QUESTION AND THAT'S PART OF I THINK BICYCLE TRAFFIC IS MORE AKIN TO SAID TRAFFIC THAN VEHICULAR TRAFFIC. AND WHEN THE CITY TRANSPORTATION REVIEWS DO A REVIEW OF THE TRAFFIC ANALYSIS, THAT'S ONE THE THINGS THEY ARE LOOKING AT. I CAN'T SPEAK TO EXACTLY HOW THEY ARE LOOKING AT THE FLOW OF BICYCLE MOVEMENT ON THE PROPERTY. I WOULD SPECULATE IT'S IN A SIMILAR MANNER AS VEHICULAR TRAFFIC AS OPPOSED TO PEDESTRIAN, BUT THEY DO ACT FOR BICYCLE TRAFFIC AND PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC IN THE OVERALL TRIP GENERATION. SO IN THEIR MODELING OF PREDICTING HOW MANY TRIPS WILL BE GENERATED FROM THIS USE, THE PETITIONER IS ACTUALLY PROVIDING THAT AND OUR TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING IS LOOKING AT THAT AND MAKING ASSUMPTIONS BASED ON NATIONAL DATA AND LOCAL CONDITIONS. HOW MANY OF THOSE TRIPS MIGHT BE VEHICULAR AND HOW MANY MIGHT BE BICYCLE AND HOW MANY MIGHT BE PEDESTRIAN? I WOULD HAVE TO FOLLOW ONE MORE DETAILS TO CONFIRM THAT, BUT I WOULD -- AGAIN, MY SENSE IS LIKE MUCH OF THE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM, THEY ARE CONSIDERED IN A SIMILAR WAY AS VEHICULAR TRAFFIC.
01:16:56.914: >> OKAY. SO I THINK PART OF MY QUESTIONS OVERLAP WITH OTHER COMMISSIONERS, MEANING THAT IF THERE IS A QUEUING HAPPENING FOR THE DRIVE THRU, AND THOSE CARS ARE NOW CUING ON TO STADIUM, TRYING TO TURN INTO THE BANK, THEY WILL BE IN VIOLATION OF THE U.D.C., BECAUSE THEY ARE IMPEDING THE VEHICULAR CIRCULATION. AND SO THAT WOULD BE A MEANS TO DENY THIS SPECIAL USE REQUEST?
01:17:38.923: >> Planning Manager:  YES, I THINK YOU ARE ECHOING SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT COMMISSIONER SAUVE SAID. THE ARRANGEMENT IS THAT THOSE CONCERNS ARE MET AND IT WILL BE A FUNKIONAL DRIVE THRU.
01:17:54.806: >> SO COMMISSIONER MILLS, YOU TALKED ABOUT BREAKING THESE SEPARATE MOTIONS. WE INITIALLY TOOK THIS AS A WHOLE MOTION. SO I WILL NEED SOME HELP FOR A MOTION TO BREAK THESE INTO PARTS SO THAT WE COULD MOVE THE GENERAL SITE PLAN FORWARD, BUT HAVE A SEPARATE MOTION ON THE S.E.U. SO THAT WE WILL MIGHT BE ABLE TO MOVE THIS PETITIONER'S REQUEST FORWARD. PA.
01:18:30.708: >> Chair Mills: SO WE WOULD SEPARATE THEM OUT. MR. LENART, HE JUST MADE THE MOTION AND SOMEBODY NEEDS TO SECOND IT, RIGHT, TO SEPARATE THEM OUT?
01:18:39.750: >> Planning Manager, YES, THAT WOULD BE ADEQUATE.
01:18:43.221: >> Chair Mills: WHY HEAR YOU. I'M SORRY.
01:18:44.822: >> Planning Manager:  YES. CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW?
01:18:48.993: >> Chair Mills: YES.
01:18:49.460: >> Planning Manager:  I'M SORRY. AS COMMISSIONER WYCHE JUST INDICATED IF THERE'S A SECOND TO SPLIT THEM, THAT WOULD BE ADEQUATE.
01:18:59.270: >> Chair Mills: I WOULD SAY COMMISSIONER SAUVE IS SEPARATING THEM OUT. NOW WHAT WE WILL DO IS WE WILL DISCUSS WHETHER THE REST OF US THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA. [ LAUGHTER ] SEPARATING THEM OUT AND WE'LL VOTE THAT WE WILL, INDEED SEPARATE THEM OUT. SO ANY DISCUSSION OF SEPARATING THEM OUT? MR. LENART?
01:19:26.230: >> Planning Manager:  IF ACTION IS TAKEN TO DENY THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE, YOU WILL NO LONGER HAVE A SITE PLAN IN FRONT OF YOU THAT WILL MEET THE REQUIREMENTS. SO AT THAT POINT -- AND THIS MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT NO THINK ABOUT, HOW YOU WANT TO COMMUNICATE TO THE PETITIONER, IF IF THE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE FIRST ACTION COULD BE REMEDIES BY RECONFIGURATION OR ALTERATION, THINK THAT'S ONE QUESTION. IF YOU DON'T SEE A DRIVE THRU AS APPROPRIATE FOR THE FACTORS IN THE U.D.C., THEN I THINK THE DECISION WOULD BE THERE'S TWO OPTIONS TO POSTPONE ACTION ON THE SITE PLAN UNDER A REVISED SITE PLAN THAT IS CONFORMING OR IF THE PETITIONER KNOWS WITHOUT THE DRIVE THREW THAT THEY ARE NOT INTERESTED IN MOVING FORWARD, THEN THE ACTION WOULD BE MORE EXPEDIENT TO DENY SITE PLAN AT THAT POINT BECAUSE IT WOULDN'T MEET -- IT WOULDN'T MEET REGULATIONS BECAUSE THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE HAD NOT BEEN GRANTED. DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?
01:20:30.428: >> IT DOES AND CAN I ASK A CLARIFYING QUESTION? AM I OUT OF ORDER?
01:20:34.899: >> Chair Mills: NO, GO AHEAD.
01:20:35.900: >> SO THE PETITIONER, HOWEVER, HAS BY RIGHT OF STAFF, AT THE START, THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO BUILD BECAUSE OF THE CONFORMING NATURE OF THE SITE PLAN WITHIN THE CITY CODE AND SO WHAT I AM TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IS BASED ON WHAT I HAVE HEARD IN THIS CONVERSATION SO FAR, THAT RIGHT IS NO LONGER VALID IF THE DRIVE THRU CREATES A CUE WHICH EXTENDS OFF THE PROPERTY ON TO THE STADIUM. THIS SITE PLAN IS NO LONGER CONFIRMED -- CONFORMING TO THE U.D.C. AND THEREFORE, IT CAN BE DENIED BY RIGHT WITHOUT -- SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I'M READING AND UNDERSTANDING WHAT I'M SEEING AND I THINK THAT ISN'T NECESSARILY A REJECTION OF THE DRIVE THRU FACILITY. IT'S THAT THE DRIVE THRU FACILITY WILL CREATE A VIOLATION OF THE U.D.C. AND BY THAT ARTICULATION, I GUESS, WE CAN DENY THIS SITE PLAN.
01:21:56.480: >> Planning Manager:  YEAH, I WOULD SUGGEST LOOKING AT IT DIFFERENTLY. BECAUSE OF THE STRUCTURE OF THE ORDINANCE, THIS PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT IS PROPOSING -- STAFF IS PRESENTING YOU TO THAT IT MEETS THE TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE CITY CODE. A TONIGHT OF THAT IS YOUR ACQUIESCENCE, THAT IS APPROVAL OF A SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE PERMIT FOR A DRIVE THRU. IF THAT -- IF THE -- THE QUESTION POSED TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION IS YOUR COMFORT, THAT THAT SITUATION THAT YOU ARE DESCRIBING WILL NOT OCCUR, HAD OR YOUR FEAR THAT IT WILL OCCUR. BASED ON YOUR PERSPECIFICKIVE ON THAT AND THE STANDARDS OF U.D. CONTRIBUTION THE PLANNING COMMISSION WILL WILL MAKE THAT DECISION THAT A DRIVE THRU IS HEREBY GRANTED OR A DRIVE THRU COULD BE GRANTED WITH SOME MODIFICATIONS OR IT SHOULD BE DENIED. IF IT IS THE LATTER OF THOSE, THAT IS THE PLANNING COMSSION FINDS THAT BASED ON THE FACTORS WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT KEWING KEW --QUEUING AND WE ARE CONCERD ABOUT THE CHARACTER, THE MASTER PLAN -- THE PROPOSED MASTER PLAN AND THE CONCERNED AUT THE FUNCTIONITY ON THAT CORRIDO TH BY DENIAL THIS SITELAN BECAUSE THAT'S BEEN DENIED DOES NOTEETHEECHNIC REQUIREMENTS OF THE OINANCE BECAUSE THAT IS NECESSA. THAT PNT, THE OIONS WLD EHER TO PRODE TIM FORTTO BE AME DRIVE THROH AT THAT POT AND FLECTHE OER STANDARDS OR IF THERE WAS NOT A DESIRE OF THE PETITIONER TO DO THAT TO JUST DENY IT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T MEET THAT STANDARD. IT WOULD ULTIMATELY PROGRESS TO CITY COUNCIL FOR A DETERMINATION WITH THAT -- WITH THAT RECOMMENDATION. I WANT TO BE CLEAR, THE DETERMINATION IS NOW, AND THAT'S THE CHALLENGE OF PREDICTING WHETHER OR NOT YOU THINK THAT IS A CONCERN OR NOT A CONCERN. ONCE THAT DECISION IS MADE ONE WAY OR ANOTHER, IT'S GRANTED IN AND IT'S A RIGHT TO DEVELOP IN THAT REGARD. IF THE PLANNING COMMISSION FINDS THOSE ARE MET, YOU ARE NOT CONCERNED WITH THE FUNCTIONALITY, BASED ON WHATEVER THOSE STANDARDS AND IT'S GRANTED, IF THAT CUING OCCURS, THAT'S -- QUEUING OCCURS THAT'S NOT GOING TO GRANT THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION THAT'S A SPECIAL USE AND AT THAT POINT, YOU WILL BE EXPERIENCING SOME OF THE OTHER ITEMS THAT WERE REFERENCED SOME OF THE OTHER ITEMS.
01:24:28.566: >> THANK YOU FOR THAT EXPLANATION.
01:24:32.570: >> Chair Mills: I -- [ NO AUDIO ]
01:24:41.612: >> Planning Manager:  I THINK I CLICKED ON YOU.
01:24:47.785: >> Chair Mills: I APPRECIATE, COMMISSIONER WYCHE AS YOUR QUESTIONS A NEWBIE, FIRST TIME HERE. IT RAISES ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS THAT WE HAVE SEEN A COUPLE OF THESE IN MY TIME, A COUPLE OF SPECIAL EXCEPTION USES FOR DRIVE THRUS AND NOW I'M WONDERING ABOUT THIS ONE. I DON'T -- WE STILL WOULD NEED TO DISCUSS THIS PARTICULAR MOTION FURTHER TO DECIDE ON HOW TO VOTE ON IT, BUT BASED ON THE CONVERSATION WE HAD SO FAR, I'M IMAGINE THAT SOME PEOPLE MAY FALL INTO THE CAMP OF LIKE NOT THIS DESIGN, OF A DRIVE THROUGH AND OTHERS MAY BE NOT A DRIVE THRU AT ALL. AND I'M CURIOUS, MR. LENART IF WHAT WE ARE VOTING ON FOR THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE IS THIS DESIGN OF A DRIVE THRU OR THE IDEA OF A DRIVE THRU AT THIS LOCATION?
01:25:44.675: >> Planning Manager:  BOTH. THE DRIVE THRU AT THIS LOCATION AND THIS CONFIGURATION.
01:25:50.447: >> Chair Mills: OKAY. SO CERTAINLY. RIGHT NOW WE ARE STILL DISCUSSING WHETHER WE SHOULD SEPARATE THESE THINGS OUT. I KNOW THAT THEY ARE TIED TO GO, BUT I THINK IT DOESN'T HURT PERSONALLY TO DO THAT. ANY OTHER -- AND THEN I DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS BECAUSE I ACTUALLY -- I'M KIND OF TORN ABOUT THOSE TWO CAMPS I WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT, LIKE I DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE I'M IN OF THE LIKE, NO DRIVE THRU EVER HERE BUT CERTAINLY THIS DESIGN, I'M NOT COMFORTABLE WITH. I DON'T THINK IT MEETS OUR STANDARDS. I WANT TO GO ON RECORD FOR SAYING THAT. ANY OTHER DISCUSSION ABOUT THE IDEA OF SEPARATING THEM OUT? ALL IN FAVOR OF THE PROPOSED MOTION TO SEPARATE THEM OUT? WE CAN DO THIS FROM JUST A HAND. I DON'T THINK WE NEED A VOICE VOTE. IF YOU ARE IN FAVOR OF TAKING TWO DIFFERENT VOTES ON THIS, ONE ON THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE AND ONE THE SITE PLAN APPROVAL, PLEASE RAISE YOUR HAND. OR SAY YES. I SEE SIX HANDS. COMMISSIONER CLARKE, ARE YOU A YES? OKAY. I SEE SEVEN HANDS. WE HAVE JUST DECIDED THAT WE WILL TAKE THEM SEPARATELY AND ALL OF THIS TIME, WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE. SO I THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO TAKE THAT. I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE, THE DRIVE THRU THAT I -- AND THAT I THEN WANT TO ASK THE PETITIONER SOME QUESTIONS ALSO ABOUT WHAT MAKES SENSE FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE IN TERMS OF HOW WE PROCEED. SO REGARDING THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE, I THINK ALL OF YOU -- I LIKE GOING LAST, BECAUSE ALL OF YOU SAY THE SMART THINGS THIS IDEA OF QUEUING AND DEMAND, PARTICULARLY WHAT WE SAW, WE HEARD FROM THE PETITIONER THAT THERE IS HIGH DEMAND. WE WOULD LIKE THREE BUT WE REDUCED IT TWO MAKES ME EVEN MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THE QUEUING. AND THE IMPACT, NOT JUST THAT THAT HAS ON BICYCLE, VEHICLE TRAFFIC BUT PEDESTRIANS EXPERIENCE. ANOTHER CONCERN OR QUESTION, THE DRIVE THRU ATM, IS THAT THE ONLY ATM OR WILL THERE BE AN ATM ON THE FRONT FACADE AS WELL OR SOMEWHERE ELSE ON THE PROPERTY? GO AHEAD, WHOEVER ON THE DEVELOPMENT TEAM WANTS TO ANSWER THAT.
01:28:23.734: >> SO I WILL TACKLE THAT ONE BUT I NEED TO MAKE A CLARIFICATION ON THE QUEUING BECAUSE I THINK THE WAY THAT MS. SAUVE ASKED THE QUESTION, I THINK TED WAS A LITTLE BIT CONFUSED. WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THAT. RIGHT NOW THE ATM IS THE ONLY CURRENT ATM IS ON THE DRIVE THRU LANE. IN WARDS TO QUEUING, TED, YOU CAN CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG. THERE ARE TWO CARS THAT COULD BE IN EACH LANE BEFORE THERE WAS ANY BLOCKING FROM THE PARKING LOT SIDE OF IT, NOT THE QUEUING THAT WOULD GO TOWARDS THE STREET, WHICH I BELIEVE WE WOULD HAVE ABOUT NINE CARS THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO GET STACKED BEFORE WE WOULD EVEN HIT STADIUM. SO AND IF I CAN JUST ADD TO THAT.
01:29:15.886: >> THAT WOULD BE MY POINT THAT THIS WOULD BE TWO CARS IN EACH LANE BEFORE IT WOULD ESSENTIALLY TART TO BACK UP INTO QUEUING LANE, THE ONE-WAY, AND THERE'S -- AGAIN, THERE WOULD STILL BE ACCESS THROUGH THE MAIN ACCESS POINT TO ALL THE PARKING, BUT THERE WOULD BE AN ADDITIONAL SEVEN CARS THAT COULD FIT IN THAT QUEUING LANE. SO 11 CARS TOTAL.
01:29:35.739: >> Chair Mills: GOT IT. FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH, THAT STILL CONCERNS ME. MAYBE YOU ONLY MAKE THAT MISTHAT I ONCE OR TWICE. BUT THE ONLY WAY OUT IF YOU INTENDED TO PARK OR YOU NEEDED TO BAIL, BECAUSE SOMEBODY IN YOUR CAR IS MELTING DOWN. MAYBE THAT'S ONLY A PARENT OF A SMALL KIDS THING THAT HAPPENS BUT THE ONLY WAY OUT OF THAT IS TO BACK UP OR WAIT IT OUT. IF THAT WERE TWO WAY, HONESTLY -- I THINK IT'S A PEDESTRIAN HAZARD TO HAVE THAT -- THE DID, A PLACE WHERE WE KNOW THAT THERE POTENTIAL FOR BACK UP, TO HAVE THE ONLY OUT BEING BACKING ON TO A BUSY SIDEWALK ON TO A BUSY STREET. THAT'S CONCERNING TO ME. ALSO MY EXPERIENCING OF BANKING IN COVID. OUR BANK THAT HAD A BRANCH DOWNTOWN. I NEVER WENT TO THE TELLER. I USED THE ATM, IT'S CLOSED. NOW I'M FORCED TO USE A BANK THAT IS OUTSIDE OF TOWN THAT UPSETS ME GREATLY. THEY ONLY HAVE A DRIVE THRU ATM AND IF I SHOW ON -- AS A PEDESTRIAN, AS I OCCASIONALLY DO, BECAUSE I OFTEN TAKE THE BUS TO THE WEST SIDE OF TOWN. I RECOGNIZE THAT I CAN CYCLE THROUGH THERE, BUT IF YOU ARE -- YOUR ONLY ATM FOR PEDESTRIANS IS IN A PLACE IS NOT DESIGNED, IT'S NOT INTENDED TO BE PEDESTRIAN FRIENDLY AND THAT IN CONJUNCTION WITH LOTS OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT OTHER COMMISSIONERS HAVE SAID, IN TERMS OF HOW THIS FITS INTO OUR MASTER PLAN, THE LAND USE ELEMENT RECOGNIZES ON THIS SECTION, IN THIS CORRIDOR, IT RECOGNIZES THE HISTORY OF ZONING HERE WAS OF AN ERA WHERE IT WAS VERY AUTO CENTERRIC WITH DRIVE THRUS AND WHILE THERE ARE ELEMENTS -- THERE'S NOT SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS TO SAY, LIKE NO MORE DRIVE THRUS IN THIS CORRIDOR, THAT'S AN OVERALL RECOMMENDATION WITHIN THE LAND USE ELEMENT AND FOR THIS PARTICULAR CORRIDOR, THERE'S A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT REDUCING CURB CUTS. AND ABOUT MAKING THINGS MORE PEDESTRIAN FRIENDLY AND SO THAT'S WHERE I THINK THAT THAT THIS DOESN'T FIT IN THE TOTALITY OF OUR LAND USE ELEMENT. I THINK IT'S THE SPECIFIC DESIGN OF THIS ONE THAT'S VERY CONCERNING AND JUST THE FACT THAT I'M NOT OF MIND -- I'M WITH COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL -- -- MAYBE -- THAT DRIVE THRUS OVERALL DON'T HAVE A PLACE EVER AND THAT WE OUGHT NEVER BUILD A NEW ONE. LIKE, I THINK THAT THERE IS A REASON THAT WE LOOK AT THESE ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS. I DON'T KNOW -- YOU KNOW, THERE'S TWO ELEMENTS THAT WOULD CERTAINLY -- LIKE, THE STRIKES AGAINST IT OVERALL FOR ME HERE. AND THAT IS, LIKE, IT'S JUST -- ESPECIALLY THAT THERE'S NO OPTION FOR PEDESTRIANS WHO WANT TO BANK AFTER HOURS, LIKE, THAT'S PROBLEMATIC FOR ME. BUT PARTICULARLY THIS DESIGN, I THINK DOES NOT MEET THE IT DOES NOT MEET THE STANDARDS. THIS IS SOMETHING I WON'T BE SUPPORTING. AND JUST TO BE CLEAR, I'M NOT SURE I CAN SUPPORT A -- I DON'T KNOW HOW I WOULD FEEL ABOUT A -- A DRIVE THRU FACILITY ANYWHERE ON THIS PROPERTY. LIKE, I WOULD HAVE TO SEE IT, AND LIKE, THAT'S ONE OF THE -- THAT'S ONE THE REASONS WHY WE HAVE THIS AS A SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE AND THAT EVEN THOUGH WE KNOW THAT DRIVE THRUS TYPICALLY GO WITH RETAIL OR SPECIAL ACTIVITIES WHY IT'S NOT BY RIGHT, WHY IT IS A SPECIAL EXCEPTION, BECAUSE IT'S FOR A SPECIAL, YOU KNOW -- SPECIAL -- IT REQUIRES EXTRA DISCRETION OR EXTRA SCRUTINY THERE. THAT WAS LONG. I'M SORRY. I ALSO JUST MAKE LOTS OF NOTES. MR. LENART, WHERE DID I GO WRONG. I WANTED TO -- IT SEEM HIS LIKE THERE'S BEEN QUITE A DISCUSSION, OBVIOUSLY ABOUT QUEUING AND THE PLANNING COMMISSION'S CONCERNS OVER IT. I DIDN'T KNOW IF YOU WANTED TO AFFORD THE PETITIONER THE OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY PULL UP A VISUAL AND JUST MAKE SURE EVERYBODY IS CLEAR ON THE QUANTITY OF VEHICLES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND THE LOCATION OF THEM. I THINK I HAVE MADE SOME ASSUMPTIONS AS WE HAVE GONE THROUGH THE DISCUSSION AND SINCE IT'S A BIG COMPONENT, I OFFER THAT TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION, IF THAT'S HELPFUL, I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S ON THE SITE PLAN BUT MAYBE AT WORST, WE COULD PULL UP A SURVEY AND THEY COULD SORT OF TALK THROUGH THE QUANTITY OF VEHICLES AND HOW THEY WOULD CIULATE. SO.
01:34:34.805: >> Chair Mills: AND I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I HAVE BEEN SCROLLING TO THE SITE PLAN WITH MY MULTIPLE SCREENS. I THINK SOMEBODY ON THE -- THE DEVELOPMENT TEAM, I'M ON PAGE 7 OF THE SITE PLAN. THAT'S WHAT I FOUND USEFUL.
01:34:56.993: >> IS THERE ANYBODY FROM THE PETITIONER TEAM THAT HAS A PARTICULAR --
01:35:00.363: >> I WILL LET TED DO THAT, BRETT.
01:35:08.238: >> I JUST PULLED UP A QUICK TRAGRAPHIC THAT SHOWS HOW THE STACKING WOULD OCCUR AND IF I CAN SHARE MY SCREEN REAL QUICK, I N --
01:35:22.586: >> Planning Manager:  YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO.
01:35:24.387: >> IT SAYS THE HOST DISABLED PARTICIPANT SCREENHARING.
01:35:40.203: >> Planning Manager:  TRY NOW. MY APOLOGIES.
01:35:46.877: >> IS IT SHOWING UP.
01:35:49.012: >> Chair Mills: YEP.
01:35:49.479: >> SO JUST TO REITERATE TWO, CARS IN EACH OF THE ACTUAL LANES BY THE BUILDING, AN ADDITIONAL SEVEN IN THE ACTUAL QUEUE LANE WITHOUT BACKING OVER THE SIDEWALKS. SO PROVIDING CLEAR ACCESS ACROSS THE DRIVE THERE, AND THEN ALL OF THE PARKING WOULD STILL BE ACCESSIBLE THROUGH THE MAIN ENTRANCE HERE. THAT'S THE LONG AND SHORT OF IT. THAT'S ALL I WANTED TO SHARE.
01:36:21.912: >> Chair Mills: THANK YOU, I THINK SHOWING THE -- THAT THERE'S TWO LANES ONCE IT WIDENS PAST THAT CURB CUT IS HELPFUL AND HOW I HEARD THE WRONG NUMBERS. I HEARD NINE. SO SEEING THAT THERE'S SEVEN THAT FIT IN THAT ALSO CLARIFIES. COMMISCOMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMID.
01:36:43.466: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: I WAS GOING TO COMMENT ON THE QUEUING, BUT TWO LINE TO THE TWO LIKE SERVER THING IS INCREDIBLY INEFFICIENT, THAT'S JUST, LIKE, DRIVES ME CRAZY. IT'S A PERSONAL THING. AND SARAH -- IF YOU NEED TO GET OUT OF THAT LINE, YOU CAN'T. YOU ARE STUCK. I REALLY APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION WE HAVE BEEN HAVING TONIGHT. I THINK I'M IN THE CAMP OF -- I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE DRIVE THRU SPECIFICALLY. MY PROBLEM IS THE WAY THAT THIS ONE IN PARTICULAR IS DESIGNED. AND I WANTED TO GO BACK TO SOMETHING THAT COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL BROUGHT UP, ABOUT THE POTENTIAL NEED TO HAVE TWO CURB CUTS ON THIS SITE FOR LIKE FIRE ACCESS AND I DON'T THINK THIS SECOND CURB CUT, THE ONE I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH, BECAUSE IT GOES UNDER A BUILDING. SO I DON'T THINK -- MAYBE STAFF CAN CONFIRM OR DENY. I DON'T THINK THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN SET UP BECAUSE OF A FIRE ACCESS FOR EMERGENCY VEHICLE ISSUE. BECAUSE I DON'T THINK IT WOULD HAVE, LIKE THE CLEARANCE OR THE WIDTH NECESSARILY TO GET THROUGH. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT MAKES SENSE WHAT I'M THINKING. LIKE, THAT CURB CUT IS NOT NEEDED FOR FIRE ACCESS FOR ANYTHING LIKE THAT, IT'S PURELY TO SERVE THE DRIVE THRU.
01:38:03.146: >> I BELIEVE THAT'S THE CASE, BUT I'M ALSO NOT THE FIRE MARSHAL. I KNOW THAT THE TWO-WAY DRIVE TO THE NORTH THAT IS PROPOSED THAT SEEMS MUCH MORE LIKELY THAT FOR INGRESS AND EGRESS FOR EMERGENCY VEHICLES THEY WOULD GO THAT WAY INSTEAD OF THROUGH A ONE-WAY UNDERNEATH A BUILDING. BUT I -- I'M SPEAKING OUT OF TURN. I DIDN'T DO THE FIRE REVIEW.
01:38:23.767: >> THANKS. THAT'S HELPFUL, THOUGH.
01:38:34.844: >> Chair Mills: MR. LENART.
01:38:35.445: >> Planning Manager:  YOU MIGHT LOOK AT PAGE 15 OF THE PROPOSED SITE PLAN DOES HAVE -- IT'S ACTUALLY THE TRASH TRUCK. THAT'S PROBABLY A VERY SIMILAR PROFILE TO WHAT THE FIRE TRUCK ACCESS WOULD REQUIRE.
01:38:52.162: >> SO MY CONCERN IS LESS THE DRIVE THRU ITSELF AND MORE THE WAY THAT THIS HAS BEEN DESIGNED. I WOULD -- IF THIS WERE TO COME BACK, REDESIGNED WITHOUT A NEW CURB CUT, I WOULD THINK I WOULD BE A LOT MORE SUPPORTIVE.
01:39:13.650: >> Chair Mills: SO WE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE. I HAVE HEARD LOTS OF CONCERNS IN ORDER NOR SOMETHING TO PASS THIS BODY, IT NEEDS SIX OF THE SEVEN OF US. SO AS WE SOMETIMES DO, MY QUESTION -- KNOWING THAT THEN US VOTING ON THIS PART MEANS THAT WE -- YOU KNOW, IT -- IT MAKES IT NOT NECESSARY FOR US REALLY TO DISCUSS THE SITE PLAN BECAUSE THERE'S A SITE PLAN THAT SHOWS A SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE THAT WE HAVE DE. MY QUESTION TO THE DEVELOPMENT TEAM IS IT Z IT MAKE SENSE FOR US TO POSTPONE THIS, WOULD YOU LIKE US TO VOTE? GO AHEAD MR. HEVERA.
01:39:57.927: >> I THINK THE MAIN QUESTION WHICH IS A LITTLE BIT CONFUSING ON OUR END IS IN REGARDS TO THE DRIVE THRU. IF WE'RE ABLE TO RECONFIGURE IT, IF WE'RE ABLE TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES, THE CURB CUTS AND EVERYTHING ELSE, IS THE DRIVE THRU GOING TO BE CONSIDERED? THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO KNOW AND UNDERSTAND. I THINK WE HAVE HEARD A LOT OF DIFFERENCE OF VIEWS THERE IN REGARDS TO THAT AND FOR US IT'S NOT VERY CLEAR EXACTLY WHERE THAT IS STANDING AT. SO THAT I GUESS ON OUR END, YOU KNOW, WE ARE -- HEY, WE ARE FINE WITH POSTPONING IT, BUT WE NEED SOME CLEAR GUIDANCE, ARE WE SPINNING OUR WHEELS ON SOMETHING THAT ISN'T SOMETHING THAT WILL HAPPEN OR NOT SO WE CAN GET CREATIVE AND SAY, YES, WE WERE ABLE TO RECONFIGURE IT AND WE PUT A DRIVE THRU -- OR AN A.T.M. IN THE VESTIBULE AS WELL TO HELP WITH THE PEDESTRIAN SIDE OF IT. WE CAN LOOK AT CERTAIN THINGS BUT AGAIN FROM THE DEVELOPMENT TEAM WE SPENT A LOT OF MONEY IN HERE. WE DON'T WANT TO KEEP SPENDING MONEY ON SOMETHING THAT, YOU NO HE ISN'T GOING TO BE MOVED FORWARD.
01:41:06.196: >> Chair Mills: THANK YOU. LIKE I SAID BEFORE, I'M NOT -- I'M NOT MORALLY OPPOSED TO DRIVE THRUS BUT I THINK THAT I WOULD WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY RESPECT THE IDEA THAT IN THIS PLACE, PEDESTRIANS COME FIRST. SO HAVING THIS THE AMENITIES FOR PEDESTRIANS AND IF AS COMMICOMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT POINTED OUT, IT CREATES APRIL EXTRA CURB CUT AND THAT'S IN OPPOSITION TO THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE MASTER PLAN FOR THIS PARTICULAR CORRIDOR, THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I THINK IS GOING TO BE DIFFICULT TO JUSTIFY, VOTING -- SUPPORTING THAT SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE. BUT THAT'S ONE PERSON. SO OTHERS, DOES ANYONE WISH TO SUGGEST? AGAIN, I WOULD ALSO SAY, LIKE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO SEE TOO. SO COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT.
01:42:02.285: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: I THINK I ALREADY SAID THIS, BECAUSE I THINK THAT IS A FAIR QUESTION. I'M NOT OPPOSED TO DR DRIVE THR. I THINK THIS FITS MORE WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR IN TERMS OF THE ORIENTATION, THEN I WOULD NOT BE OPPOSED TO APPROVING A SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE. SO I'M NOT OPPOSED TO DRIVE THRUS IN GENERAL.
01:42:29.479: >> COMMISSIONER CLARK?
01:42:32.215: >> Commissioner Clarke: I WANT TO BE UP FRONT. I HAVE THINK I MADE MY POSITION CLEAR EARLIER. I WON'T BE SUPPORTING ANYTHING THAT WILL BE A DRIVE THRU IN THIS AREA. IT WOULD HAVE TO BE PRETTY EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES. I JUST WANT TO BE UP FRONT ABOUT THAT.
01:42:48.598: >> Chair Mills: THANK YOU. COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL.
01:42:51.134: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: FOR ME, I THINK THAT I'M -- I WAS MORE OPEN TO A DRIVE THRU WHERE IT WAS RIGHT OFF OF THE HIGHWAY, LIKE WHEN WE WERE OVER ON PLYMOUTH ROAD LOOKING AT THAT AND PEOPLE CAN GET OFF AND DO THEIR BUSINESS AND GET BACK ON. HERE IT FEELS LIKE -- I KNOW WE ARE SORT OF NEAR THE HIGHWAY, BUT THIS CORRIDOR DOESN'T EXIST BECAUSE OF THE HIGHWAY. IT -- IT -- YOU KNOW, IT SERVES SOMEWHAT THERE, BUT REALLY GETTING IN THROUGH THAT LIGHT AT THE SECTION OF -- YOU KNOW, JACKSON AND MAPLE IS LIKE NOT VERY MANY PEOPLE WANT TO GO THROUGH THAT TO GO DOWN AND FIGURE O OUT A BANK. I THINK FOR ME, A DRIVE THRU HERE IS -- I DON'T WANT TO RIDE THROUGH THIS HERE. I WANT TO FEEL THAT WE'RE DEVELOPING THIS INTO A PEDESTRIAN-FRIENDLY CORRIDOR. I REALIZE IT WILL TAKE A LOT OF TIME AND I THINK THAT'S WHY WE ARE LOOKING AT IT AS THE TC-1 DESIGNATION AND THE NEIGHBORHOODS RIGHT THERE, AND SO THAT'S WHERE I AM WITH IT. I JUST DON'T -- I TOTALLY THIS IT WOULD BE USED BUT I THINK IT'S NOT WHAT WE WANT TO TRY TO SUPPORT RIGHT NOW. EVEN IF IT GETS RESIGNED, IT'S A BANK THAT PEOPLE CAN WALK TO AND BIKE THROUGH AND FEEL EASY AND GOOD ABOUT THAT.
01:44:15.084: >> Chair Mills: I DON'T THINK EVERYBODY HAS TO CHANNEL THEIR INTENTIONS BUT IF ANYBODY ELSE HAS COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. COMMISSIONER WYCHE.
01:44:26.362: >> JUST TO BE FAIR TO THE DEVELOPERS, I WOULD ALSO ECHO THAT I WOULDN'T SUPPORT A DRIVE THRU HERE IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT THIS CORRIDOR IS MOVING TOWARDS TC-1. THE OTHER CONCERNS THAT I HAD ABOUT THE -- THE VEHICULAR CIRCULATION, AS WELL AS THE PEDESTRIAN HARM FOR THE CURRENT SITE. SO I WOULD PLACE MY -- MY INTENTIONS IN THAT DIRECTION.
01:44:51.287: >> Chair Mills: THANK YOU. I ALSO WANT TO ADD REGARDLESS BECAUSE THERE MIGHT NOT BE AN OPTION WHEN WE GO TO VOTE ON THIS, WITH REGARDS TO THE SITE PLAN, I JUST NOTE THAT THE INSTALLED E.V. PARKING IS THE FARTHEST PARKING SPOTS FROM THE BUILDING, WHICH I'M CURIOUS ABOUT THE REASON FOR THAT, BUT ALSO LIKE, THAT JUST STRIKES ME AS VERY -- SENDING NOT A GREAT MESSAGE ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT THAT IS. SO -- SO IN TERMS OF A FUTURE ITERATION. WOULD YOU LIKE THIS POSTPONED?
01:45:45.608: >> YES, IF YOU WANT TO POSTPONE IT, WE WILL TAKE A LOOK AT IT AND WE WILL DISCUSS ON OUR TEAM BASED UPON THE COMMENTS WE ARE HEARING. I THINK IT'S UNFORTUNATELY WHAT WE ARE HEARING, WE FEEL IT'S VERY UNFORTUNATE THAT, YOU KNOW, IN LIGHT OF THE -- ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF COVID AND EVERYTHING WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH, THAT THE VIEW ON DRIVE THRUS, WE CAN UNDERSTAND THE COMMISSION, BUT I DID -- I WOULD ASK -- I WOULD WONDER HOW EVERYONE DOES THEIR CURRENT BUSINESS DAY-TO-DAY NOW WITH THINGS AND DRIVE TUS AS WELL. BUT THERE IS STILL A PLACE FOR THOSE, I BELIEVE. WE WILL TAKE A LOOK AT IT. OBVIOUSLY. AND WE WILL GO FROM THERE, I GUESS.
01:46:26.949: >> Chair Mills: WOULD A COMMISSIONER BE WILLING TO MOVE POSTPONEMENT OF THIS? MAKE A MOTION TO POSTPONE?
01:46:34.891: >> CAN I I DO A POINT OF ORDER, THOUGH?
01:46:38.060: >> Chair Mills: YES.
01:46:38.528: >> SO WE MADE A MOTION. AND SO DO WE -- CAN WE JUST ABANDON THAT MOTION? OR DO WE HAVE TO WITHDRAW THAT MOTION? I DON'T KNOW IF WE USE ROBERT'S RULES OF ORDER. I DON'T KNOW HOW WE DO OUR VOTING. I WOULD HAVE TO --
01:46:52.975: >> Chair Mills: IT'S LOOSE. IT'S LOOSE BECAUSE WE DO NOT -- WE DO NOT HAVE A PARLIAMENTARIAN. IF YOU WANT TO BRING THAT SKILL TO US, BRING IT ON!
01:47:01.551: >> NO, NO, I'M NOT VOLUNTEERING FOR ANYTHING JUST YET. I HAVE A LOT OF READING TO DO. [ LAUGHTER ]
01:47:09.125: >> Chair Mills: WHERE I THINK WE ARE, WE SEPARATED THEM OUT. WE DECIDED TO SEPARATE THEM OUT AND RIGHT FOUL WE ARE TECHNICALLY UNDER DISCUSSION OF THE FIRST MOTION. WE ARE MOVING TO POSTPONE THAT. THEN BECAUSE WE SEPARATED THEM OUT, WE WILL HAVE POSTPONE THE SECOND ONE TOO, RIGHT MR. LENART?
01:47:23.339: >> Planning Mager:  RIGHT AND I WOULD SUGGEST -- I'M HAPPY TO WITHDRAW MY MOTION.
01:47:30.646: >> Planning Manager:  NO. NO.
01:47:33.516: >> OKAY.
01:47:33.783: >> Chair Mills: ANY OTHER DISCUSSION OF THE SITE PLAN, I THINK THAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL, PARTICULARLY IF WE ARE POSTPONING THAT, SO,IKE, I PUT MY 2 CENTS I ABOUT THE E.V CHGE AT E WNG PLACE. YE MR.ENART.
01:47:45.294: >> Planning Manager:  I WANT TO BE CLEAR, THE MOTIONS HAVE BEEN SPLIT. THERE IS A MOTION NOW WE'RE DISCUSSING THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE. IT SOUNDING LIKE THERE WILL BE CONDITION OF A MOTION TO POSTPONE ACTION ON THAT POTENTIALLY. IF YOU DO SO, I WOULD SUGGEST THE SEPTEMBER 21st MEETING. THAT WOULD PROVIDE THE PETITIONER SOMETIME TO CONSIDER THEIR OPTIONS AND ALSO CITY STAFF POTENTIALLY TIME TO RESPOND TO ANY ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS THAT THEY PROVIDE. AND SO, THAT WOULD BE THE NEXT PORTION OF ACTION ON THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE. THEN WE WOULD MOVE TO THE SITE PLAN MOTION WHERE IF THERE WAS ANY ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION ON THE SITE PLAN, COULD YOU UNDERTAKE THAT, BUT I WOULD AGREE, IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO THEN POSTPONE THAT AS WELL.
01:48:43.552: >> Chair Mills: I SAW THE HANDS FOR THE MOTIONS TO POSTPOPE BY COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT AND COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL. THANK YOU FOR NODDING YOUR HEADS. ANY DISCUSSION OF POSTPONING TO THE SECOND MEETING, THE THIRD TUESDAY IN SEPTEMBER? ALL THOSE IN FAVOR OF MOVE POSTPONING? THAT IS ALL THE HA HANDS. IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION. SITE PLAN OR PRESUMABLY THIS WILL HAVE TO BE REDESIGNED. SO ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR DISCUSSIONS OF THE SITE PLAN? ALL RIGHT. GO AHEAD COMMISSIONER HAMMER HAVE MITT.
01:49:34.403: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: I WOULD ENCOURAGE THE COMMISSIONER IF YOU HAVE TO GO BACK AND LOOK AT THIS TAKE A LOOK AT TC-1 ZONING AND SEE IF THERE'S ANY DENSITY OR REDUCED PARKING OR ANYTHING, LIKE, IN THAT NEW ZONE THAT WE HAVE THAT MIGHT ACTUALLY END UP WORKING FOR YOU. POTENTIALLY IF THERE'S MORE DENSITY, I THINK SOLAR MIGHT HELP. I WOULD ENCOURAGE THAT.
01:50:05.735: >> Chair Mills: ANYTHING ELSE? WOULD SOMEONE LIKE TO MAKE A MOTION TO POSTPONE THEN? MOVED BY COMMISSIONER DISCH SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER SAUVE. ANY DISCUSSION OF THE MOTION TO POSTPONE? ALSO TO THE SECOND MEETING IN SEPTEMBER. I SEE NONE. ALL IN FAVOR THE MOTION TO POSTPONE? THAT IS ALL OF THE HANDS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ALL RIGHT. I HAVE TO FIND MY AGENDA AGAIN. IT'S 9:00, CAN WE TAKE -- OR ALMOST 9:00. CAN WE TAKE A FIVE-MINUTE BREAK TO FILL UP WATER BOTTLES AND WE'LL SEE YOU BACK HERE AT 8:57. LET'S MAKE IT 9:00. WE WILL ROUND IT TO 9:00. TAKE A COUPLE OF MINUTES. PL [ BREAK ]
01:59:04.272: >> Chair Mills: WE WILL CONTINUE ON WITH 9B WHICH IS ALSO NEW BUSINESS. THIS IS 3850 AND 3860 RESEARCH PARK DRIVE, A SITE PLAN AND SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE PERMI FOR A MARIJUA PROVISIONING CENTER/RETAILER, AND THE ADDITION OF AN OUTDOOR PATIO TO COURTYARD OF AN EXISTING HOTEL. SO AS OUR NORMAL ORDER OF OPERATIONS, THE PETITIOR YOU HAVE UP TO TEN MINUTES TO PROVIDE COMMENTS. IT LOOKS LIKE MR. CHENG HAS THE SLIDES UP. AND THEN WE TURN  OVER TO HIM FOR HIS PRESEATION AS WEL STT T CLOCKE READY, WE WILL
01:59:44.146: >> PERCT. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND TNK YOU, SLES.NGORELPING WIT THE SO MY NAM IS TRAVIS COPENHAVER. JUST TO ACCLIMATE, THIS IS SOUTH OF RESEARCH PARK DRIVE AND STATE STREET. FAIRLY SIMILAR TO BRENTWOOD MALL. THERE ARE TWO REQUESTS. ONE IS FOR A REQUEST FOR A PAVED BRICK PATIO, FEATURING ON THE HOTEL PORTION, AND THEN I WILL PROBABLY FOCUS MOST OF MY DISCUSSION ON THE REQUEST FOR A PROVISIONING CENTER APP APPROVAR THE STRUCTURE IN THE NORTHWEST SECTION OF OUR PARCEL, MOST CLOSELY IN PROXIMITY TO STATE STREET PARK. SO I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF SLIDES, I'M MOSTLY GOING TO GIVE YOU THE FACTUAL SUMMARY OF HOW WE GOT HERE. THANK YOU COMMISSIONERS FOR YOUR TIME AND BEFORE WE GET ANY FURTHER, GIVEN THE UNIQUE CHALLENGES OF JUST CANNABIS LIMITATIONS FOR THIS TYPE OF USE IN THE CITY OF NOMAR GARCIAPARR. WE ACTUALLY INITIATED THIS SEPTEMBER OF 2018, OBVIOUSLY A LOT HAS HAPPENED BETWEEN 2018 AND PRESENT TO GET US TO THIS POINT. RECENTLY, THERE'S A CAP FOR OUR CANNABIS LICENSE TYPE USE HERE OF 28, ONE OF THOSE SLOTS OPENED UP, WHICH IS WHY WE ARE BEFORE YOU TODAY AND I WANT TO REALLY SINCERELY THANK BOTH MR. LENART AND MR. CHENG FOR THEIR ASSISTANCE IN WORKING WITH US, GETTING BACK TO THE SEAT HERE TO DISCUSS THIS PROJECT. ESPECIALLY MR. CHENG OVER THE LAST TWO WEEKS HAS BEEN VERY, VERY HELPFUL TO US, REGARDLESS OF HOW EVERYTHING GOES TONIGHT. THANK YOU TO THOSE TWO FOLKS. WE ARE PROPOSING TO BASICALLY PUT TO USE THE HIGHLIGHTED STRUCTURE ON THIS SLIDE HERE AS A PROPOSED PROVISIONING CENTER. I'M SURE THE COMMISSION IS VERY FAMILIAR WITH WHAT THAT MEANS IN THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR, BUT BY COMMON PARLANCE, A CANNABIS DISPENSARY, IT'S FOR ADULT AND MEDICAL USE. AND IT IS ONLY THE FIRST FLOOR PORTION OF WHAT IS HIGHLIGHTED THERE ON THAT STRUCTURE. THE UPPER FLOOR IS CURRENTLY ANTICIPATED FOR FUTURE USE OR POTENTIALLY OTHER BUSINESS, OR POTENTIALLY OFFICE SPACE AT THIS POINT, BUT THE ONLY USE FOR DISCUSSION ON THAT UNIT IS THE FIRST FLOOR. THAT'S THE FLOOR PLAN SLIDE THAT WE WORKED THROUGH QUICKLY. AND THEN THE OTHER REQUEST THAT'S PART AND PARCEL WITH THIS PRESENTATION TODAY, IS FOR A PATIO THAT'S FOR THE OTHER PHYSICAL STRUCTURE THAT IS, YOU KNOW, IN THE SOUTHEAST PORTION OF, THAT THE HOTEL ITSELF. BOTH OF THEM PUT TOGETHER FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. I WILL BE, LIKE I SAID SPEAKING PRIMARILY TO THE CANNY BUSINESS. THE -- CANNABIS. THE OPERATOR IS WORKING WITH THE HOTEL AND THE PROPOSED PROVISIONING CENTER LOCATION. IT'S AN OVERALL SITE EFFORT TO PUT THIS USE IN PLACE WHICH MEANS THE HOTEL THAT'S CURRENTLY THERE AND THE PROPOSED RETAIL DISPENSARY PROVISIONING CENTER DO HAVE EACH OTHER'S SUPPORT AND BELIEVE THAT IT'S IN BOTH PARTY'S BEST INTEREST FOR BOTH OF THOSE USES TO CONTINUE FORWARD. AS YOU LOOK AT THE SITE ITSELF, THERE'S AMPLE PARKING DUE TO THE HOTEL USE AND WE ALSO BELIEVE IN COMPARISON TO SOME OF THE OTHER CANNABIS RETAIL BUSINESSES IN THE CITY AS A WHOLE, US BEING NOT ONLY VERY CONVENIENTLY LOCATED TO THE STATE STREET HIGHWAY INTERSECTIONS BUT ALSO NOT BEING DIRECTLY ON TO STATE STREET, HAVING OUR MAIN POINT OF EGRESS BE ACTUALLY BE ON RESEARCH PARK DRIVE, WITH QUITE A LARGE PARKING SPOT, IT WILL BE CONVENIENT FOR POTENTIAL CONSUMERS BUT ALSO HOPEFULLY IN OUR POSITION, OF COURSE, WE CERTAINLY BELIEVE AN EASIER ACCESS POINT HOPEFULLY POTENTIALLY SAFER AND LESS OF A TRAFFIC IMPACT IN OUR OPINION BASED ON WHAT WE ANTICIPATE FOR THIS SITE. WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THAT THIS COULD BE A CONTROVERSIAL TOPIC IF ANYONE HAS CONCERNS OF THE CANNABIS NATURE. WE DO HAVE MATERIALS ORIGINALLY PROPOSED IN 2018, AND OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF OPERATIONAL STANDARDS AND DEVELOPMENT HAVE OCCURRED IN THE CANNY BUSINESS INDUSTRY SINCE THEN. -- CANNY BUSINESS INDUSTRY SINCE THEN. THE ACTUAL OPERATORS FORSYTHE DO HAVE OTHER OPERATIONS AND HAVE CANNABIS EXPERIENCE FOR THEIR SITES AND WE DON'T ANTICIPATE THIS BEING A CASE OF FIRST IMPRESSION. THESE ARE EXPERIENCED OPERATORS. SO THE ACTUAL PROPOSED USAGE AT THIS LOCATION, WE HAVE QUITE A LOT OF OPTIMISM. WE THINK IT WILL BE A WONDERFUL LOCATION FOR THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY CONSIDERATION. SITE ITSELF, WE ARE VERY EXCITED ABOUT. AND WE WELCOME ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE. I DON'T WANT TO TAKE MUCH MORE OF YOUR TIME. I WOULD LIKE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AND KIND OF, YOU NOAH DR. HE IS CONCERNS IF THERE -- YOU NOAH DRESS CONCERNS IF THERE'S ANY APPETITE FOR THAT. JUST TO SPEAK ABOUT THE PAVED PORTION. WE DON'T THINK IT WILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT LIKE STORMWATER AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE. THE PRIMARY INTENT OF US WANTING TO PAY THAT IS AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THIS PICTURE SPECIFICALLY, WE DO ANTICIPATE HOTEL CONSUMERS TO WANT TO BE USING THIS UPPER SPACE SO IN ORDER TO PREVENT THINGS LIKE MUD AND JUST GENERAL CLEANLINESS AND CONVENIENCE, AS YOU CAN SEE, WE ANTICIPATE LIKE STRUCTURES LIKE, YOU KNOW, FIRE PITS AND THINGS SHOULD THAT BE APPROPRIATE. YOU KNOW, THAT'S KIND OF THE INTENTION BEHIND THE PAVEMENT PORTION OF THIS. AS IT COMES TO SIMILAR USES ON THE CANNABIS ASPECT OF THIS USE, WE THINK IT WILL BE QUITE SIMILAR IN PRESENTATION TO THE OTHER CLOSELY PROXIMITY RETAIL ESTABLISHMENT OFF OF THE  HE WILLS ACCESS POINT -- ELLSO WORTH ACCESS POINT. THE LOCATION ITSELF IS IN THE CB2 SERVICES BUSINESS DISTRICT. WE THINK THAT OUR PROPOSED RETAIL ADDITION TO THIS SITE IS IN LINE GENERALLY SPEAKING WITH OTHER GENERAL RETAIL ANTICIPATED USES IN THIS AREA. COMPARED TO WHERE OTHER RETAIL LOCATIONS FOR CA CANNABIS IS LOCATED. WE THINK IT WILL HAVE LESS IMPACT WHERE YOU FIND SOME OF THE OTHER RETAIL LOCATIONS LIKE PLACES LIKE DOWNTOWN AND PLACES LIKE THAT. WE ARE NOT CONCERNED. THE HOTEL IS QUITE SUPPORTIVE OF OUR PROPOSAL, SHOULD THERE BE ANY CONCERN FOR HOW A USE LIKE THIS MIGHT IMPACT SOMEONE SAYING AT A HOTEL, WE ARE -- STAYING AT A HOTEL, E WE ARE WILLING TO CONCERNS. THERE'S RESTAURANT THAT WILL HAVE SIMILAR HOURS OF OPERATION PROPOSED. AND THERE DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE ANY FIXED STANDING RESIDENTIAL, LIKE, UNITS OR SINGLE HOME MIXED USE TYPE DEVELOPMENTS THIS A SIGNIFICANT PROXIMITY TO OUR LOCATION. WE HAVE EXPERIENCE LIKE MITIGATING ODOR. WE DON'T THINK IT WILL BE A CONCERN AT THIS LOCATION. AND MOST OF THE TIME OUR HOTEL PARTNERS IN THIS OVERALL PROJECT ARE QUITE SUPPORTIVE OF OUR USE. WE BELIEVE APPROVAL OF THIS SITE AND ALLOWING US TO PROCEED WITH DEVELOPING UNIT TWO, THE HIGHLIGHTED ONE ON THIS SLIDE WILL HELP US FURTHER CONTINUE TO CONTINUE THIS SITE AND EXPLORE QUITE A FEW ADDITIONAL OPERATIONS. BUT IT'S ANTICIPATED AS GENERAL OFFICE USE AND NOT USED AT THE MOMENT. OVERALL, WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION. WE APPRECIATE THAT, YOU KNOW, REQUEST FOR CANNABIS USE CAN BE MORE CONCERNING IN OTHER MUNICIPALITIES. WE ARE HAPPY TO WORK THE CITY AND I WILL YIELD MY TIME TO YOU GUYS AND HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
02:07:40.955: >> Chair Mills: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MR. CHENG, ANYTHING TO ADD?
02:07:45.293: >> YES, I WILL JUST PROBABLY POINT OUT A COUPLE OF OTHER ISSUES. PETITIONER DID A GREAT JOB MAKING THE PRESENTATION. THERE ARE TWO ASPECTS TO THE APPROVAL. THIS IS THE COURTYARD. IT WAS ORIGINALLY APPROVED BACK IN 2015. IT WAS JUST BRASS AND THEN THEY HAD A COUPLE OF GROUND PLANTINGS THERE. PLANTING THERE. DURING OUR CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY, IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THEY DID PUT IN THE BRICK PAVERS WHICH INCREASED THE IMPERVIOUS SURFACE. IT WAS REVIEWED AND APPROVED BY THE CITY STORMWATER REVIEWER, AND THERE'S CAPACITY IN THE STORM WALTER. SO THEY HAVE GIVEN THEIR BLESSING AT LEAST FROM THEIR VEHIREVIEW AS FAR AS RETURNING S FROM GRASS TO BRICK PAVERS. THERE WAS NO REQUIRED LANDSCAPING THAT WAS PART OF THE INTERIOR COURTYARD. MOVING ON AS PREVIOUSLY STATED, THERE'S A MAXIMUM OR AT LEAST THEY ARE CAPPED AT 28 MEDICAL MARIJUANA DISPENSARIES IN THE CITY. THEY HAVE BEEN IN THE QUEUE SINCE 2018. ONE OF THE EXPENSERRIES PUSHED THEM UP IN LINE. SO THEY ARE NUMBER 28. THEY ARE LITTLE ORANGE BUILDING TO MOVE RETAIL UP TO STATE STREET. THEY CAPPED AT 4500 SQUARE FEET FOR THE MEDICAL MARIJUANA DISPENSARY. AND THE HOURS ARE 9 A.M. TO 9 P.M. MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY AND 12 P.M. TO 7 P.M. ON SUNDAY, AS PART OF THEIR SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE. IF THEY WERE TO VEER FROM THAT, THEY WOULD HAVE TO COME IN AND MAKE CHANGES OR WE CAN PROPOSE CHANGES TONIGHT FOR, YOU KNOW, DAYS OF OPERATION, AND HOURS. HERE IS THE UPDATED FLOOR PLAN WHICH IS THE FIRST FLOOR OF THE 3850-3860 RESEARCH PARK DRIVE. I'M OPEN TO ANY QUESTIONS THAT PLANNING COMMISSION MIGHT HAVE.
02:10:02.163: >> Chair Mills: VERY GOOD. NEXT UP IS A PUBLIC HEARING FOR THIS ITEM. SO THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PERSONS TO SPEAK FOR UP TO THREE MINUTES ABOUT THE PROPOSED 3850 AND 3860 RESEARCH PARK SITE PLAN, AND SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE PERMIT. IF YOU WISH TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION ON THIS ITEM, PRESS STAR NINE IF YOU ARE LISTENING BY PHONE. OR YOU CAN RAISE YOUR HAND IF YOU ARE VIEWING US THROUGH THE WEB LINK. FOR PHONE ACCESS, PRESIDENT CALL 877-853-5247 AND ENTER MEETING I.D., 97766341226. MR. LENART WILL CALL ON THOSE WOULD HAVE RAISED THEIR HANDS CALLING ON YOU BY THE LAST THREE DIGITS OF YOUR PHONE NUMBER OR IF YOU ARE JOINING US THROUGH ZOOM, THEN BY YOUR NAME. AND AS ALWAYS, PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRE AT THE BEGINNING OF YR COMMENTS. I'M NOT SEEING ANYBODY CALLING IN BECAUSE THE BROADCAST DELAY. I'M GOING TO CALL IT, IN PART BECAUSE THERE'S A VERY LONG -- THE PETITIONS ARE VERY LONG TO READ. THE CONGR LANGUAGE OF THIS AS MR. CHENG NOTED. FIRST ONE IS SHORT I WILL READ. THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION HEREBY APPROVES THE STAYBRIDGE SITE PLANT 3850 DRIVE. AFTER ARING ALL INTESTED RELEVANT IORMATION, INCLUDING AN ACCOMPANYG SITE PLAN, FINDS E 38 PETIO SUBSTANALLY MESHE DEFINITION CHAPTER 55 OF THE UNIFIED SPECLXCEPTIONS ANDCTION 5.25 CONCERNG MEDAL USE OTIONS AN THEREFORE, APPROVES THE 3860 RESEARCH PARK SPECIAL EXCEPTION FOR A MEDICAL MARIJUANA PROVISIONING CENTER. THIS IS BASED ON THE FOLLOWING FINDS, ONE THE PROPOSED USE IS CONSISTENT WITH THE C2B BUSINESS SERVICE DISTRICT, WHICH PROVIDES FOR COMMERCIAL AND RETAIL ACTIVITIES AS WELL AS OFFICE AND RESIDENTIAL USES. THE TWO PROPOSED USE WILL NOT ADVERSELY IMPACT TRAFFIC, PEDESTRIANS, BICYCLE CIRCULATION OR INTERSECTIONS BASED ON THE LOCATION, BOTH STATE STREET AND RESEARCH PARK DRIVE PROVIDES ACADEQUATE ACCESS TO THE SITE AND THE PROPOSED USE IS CONSISTENT WITH OTHER SURROUNDING USES TRAFFIC IMPACT. THREE, THROUGH DOCUMENTATION SUBMITTED BY THE PETITIONER REGARDING WASTE DISPOSAL, INVENTORY TRACKING, SECURITY AND OR MEASURES OF OPERATION OF THE FACILITY, THE PROVISIONING CENTER WILL BE OPERATED IN A MANNER THAT WILL NOT HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE NEIGHBORING PROPERTIES OR AREA AND WILL NOT HAVE A DETRIMENTAL IMPACT ON NATURAL FEATURES. THIS SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE APPROVAL IS BASED ON THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS.

AND THAT THE ANN ARBOR PLANNING COMMISSION APPROVES THE ATTACHED SITE PLAN WHICH DEMONSTRATES COMPLIANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE STANDARDS. MOVED BY COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL. SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER SAUVE. DISCUSSION OF THE TWO PETITIONS? GO AHEADR. COMMI COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT AND COMMISSIONER SAUVE AND G GIBB-RANDALL.
02:14:25.660: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: IT WAS SUPPOSED T TO BE GRASS. WHEN I LOOKED AT THE 2019 IT SAID BRICK PAVERS, LIKE IN THE LITTLE THING. I JUST WASN'T SURE -- I GUESS IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER, LIKE THEY DID IT, BUT WAS THERE SOMETHING ELSE THAT WAS CHANGED AFTER THE SITE PLAN THAT SAID, LIKE, WELL THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE GRASS AND THEN THEY WERE FOUND IT VIOLATION OR THIS -- I WILL WILL HAVE TO DOUBLE CHECK IT. THERE WAS GRASS AND LANDSCAPING IN THERE. I WILL COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING THAT WOULD STATE IT WAS ANYTHING OTHER THAN GRASS.
02:15:12.106: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: IT WAS PAGE 3 --
02:15:17.011: >> THE 2015.
02:15:17.345: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: I FOUND IT SOMEWHERE. AND IT'S PAGE 3, OR WHATEVER I FOUND. I GUESS IT WAS PROBABLY SITE PLAN THAT WAS COMMITTED BACK IN 2015.
02:15:26.220: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: THAT'S ALL I HAVE FOR NOW.
02:15:34.929: >> Chair Mills: COMMISSIONER SITE. WHILE WE SORT OUT THE --
02:15:39.867: >> Councilmember Disch: IT WILL BE INTERESTED IF PAVERS WERE EVER MENTIONED BEFORE. I WANT TO CLARIFY THAT WE ARE BEING -- WE ARE BEING ASKED TO APPROVE A SITE PLAN FOR SOMETHING THAT'S ALREADY HAPPENED? SO IF WE DIDN'T, WHAT WOULD HAPPEN? LET ME PUT IT ANOTHER WAY.
02:16:08.062: >> Planning Manager:  I THINK MR. CHENG IS LOOKING FOR --
02:16:11.365: >> I'M GETTING DISTRACTED GOING THROUGH THE OLD SITE PLAN. I APOLOGIZE.
02:16:17.605: >> Planning Manager:  IF IT DENIED AND THE 2015, SHOWED GRASS. THEY WOULD NEED TO RESTORE THE PLAN WHO WAS APPROVED IN THE 2015 SITE PLAN. IF WE WOULD TYPICALLY DO THAT THROUGH ENFORCEMENT AND WE WOULD GIVE THEM TIME FRAME FOR COMPLIANCE AND IF THEY DIDN'T DO, THAT THEN COMMISSION THEN TE SUBJECT TO CITATIONS.
02:16:43.798: >> Councilmember Disch: AND HOW OFTEN DO PETITIONERS COME TO US WITH SITE PLANS FOR THINGS THAT ARE ALREADY DONE AND ASK US TO APPROVE THEM IN RETROSPECT?
02:16:59.280: >> Planning Manager:  RARE.
02:17:03.351: >> Councilmember Disch: RARE. 950 HAD AFFECTED LANDMARK TREES THAT'S ANOTHER EXA EXAMPLE OF CG BACK TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION TO REMEDY SOMETHING.
02:17:13.894: >> Councilmember Disch: SO I MEAN, I'M NOT -- I'M EXPRESS -- I MEAN TO SAY THAT I DO KNOT DO NOT MEANTO EXPRESS IRRITATIO. I WAS CURIOUS, BUT FACT IS THAT THIS INCREASES IMPERVIOUS SURFACE AND WE ARE IN A HELL OF A RAIN SEASON, UP UNTIL NOW WHEN WE STARTED THE JULY DROUGHT. BUT IT'S AUGUST. SO INCREASES OF IMPERVIOUS SURFACES ARE AN INTEREST OF ME AROUND TOWN. IS THERE ANYTHING WE COULD ASK FOR? I MEAN, I UNDERSTAND THAT RETENTIONS WERE PUT IN. IT WAS DONE CORRECTLY BUT NOT ACCORDING TO THE PLAN.
02:18:17.024: >> Planning Manager:  WE COULD ASK BUT AT THE CORE, LIKE A SITE PLAN THAT'S DONE IN ADVANCE, IT DOESN'ITDOES NOT MEET THE REGULR NOT.
02:18:31.338: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: I THINK I WAS WRONG, GUYS. I THINK WAS LOOKING AT THE CURRENT SITE PLAN.
02:18:38.512: >> Councilmember Disch: OKAY.
02:18:39.146: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: I THINK I THOUGHT I WAS LOOKING AT THE OLD ONE AND I THINK I WAS --
02:18:42.883: >> OKAY. I'M STILL LOOKING AND I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU, IS IT LANDSCAPE SHEET FOUR, SHEET FOUR OVERALL. BUT I'M LOOKING BACK IN THE 2014 SITE PLAN SET, NOT THE ONE THAT WAS RECENTLY SUBMITTED THAT SHOWED THE BRICK PAVERS.
02:18:56.163: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: I THINK I THOUGHT -- I'M SORRY. SORRY.
02:19:02.436: >> Councilmember Disch: I SEE THAT THE PETITIONER WOULD LIKE TO RESPOND TO MY QUESTION. SO I INVITE THAT.
02:19:10.644: >> Chair Mills: VERY GOOD.
02:19:11.212: >> THANK YOU. IF THAT'S APPROPRIATE. I DIDN'T WANT TO SPEAK OUT OF TURN. I HAVE DIDN'T MEAN TO DOWNPLAY OR MINIMIZE YOUR STATEMENT. WE DID, IN FACT, HAVE PAVERS -- THERE WAS CONFUSION ABOUT THE PROCESS FOR DOING THAT. WE DID IT OUT OF TURN. FORGIVE ME, OBVIOUSLY, AS THE TWO REQUESTS ARE QUITE FACTUAL DISTINGUISHABLE FROM ONE ANOTHER, I CHOSE TO FOCUS ON ONE A BIT MORE THAN THE OTHER. BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT IS OF SIGNIFICANT CONCERN, IT'S OUR HOPE THAT WHAT WAS INSTALLED IS MEETING REGULATIONS TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE'S CONCERN OR PERHAPS ADDITIONAL STEPS YOU WOULD LIKE US TO TAKE TO BE CORRECTIVE OF THAT MISEATEN AT PAVER INFORMATION. DID I NOT MEAN TO DOWNPLAY THAT OR ANYTHING. SO THANK YOU.
02:20:10.104: >> Councilmember Disch: I WONDER IF THERE'S SOMETHING WE CAN ASK, A TREE, A BUSH, ANYTHING, A SHRUB.
02:20:20.981: >> Chair Mills: COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL, YOUR HAND WAS RAISED BEFORE. YOU WERE IN THE QUEUE.
02:20:24.685: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: DIDN'T THEY SAY THERE WAS CAPACITY IN THE STORMWATER SYSTEM? SO -- AND THIS SOMETIMES GETS -- THIS HAPPENS, YOU KNOW, YOU OVER DESIGN A LITTLE BIT, NOT BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU WILL VIO VIOLATE I. I THINK IN TERMS OF YOUR CONCERN, COMMISSIONER DISCH, IT IS WITHIN, YOU KNOW, THE ALLOWABLE AMOUNT. SO IF IT WERE OVER, THEN THAT FEELS DIFFERENT TO ME. I MEAN, IT'S NEVER GOOD TO JUST DO IT WITHOUT ASKING. IT IS SOMETHING THAT MANY PEOPLE GET CONFUSED ABOUT BY ADDING A PATIO, AND IT'S DIFFERENT THAN THE EYES OF THE CITY. AND -- THE UPCOMING AGENDA ITEMS, YOU KNOW, WITH THE -- THE MAJOR AND MINOR SITE PLANS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. SO -- I MEAN, I GUESS THIS WASN'T GOING TO BE WHAT I WAS GOING TO TALK ABOUT, BUT THIS IS NOT  A TREE OR BUSH. IN THE CANNABIS PROCESS, THEY USE AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF ENERGY. I KNOW IN THE PAST WE HAVE ASKED OTHER PETITIONERS AT TIMES TO BE ABLE TO HAVE SOME SOLAR ON THE PROJECT IN ORDER TO KIND OF IN SOME WAYS MAKE AMENDS FOR THE INDUSTRY, YOU KNOW, AND THAT WAY -- SO THAT'S SOMETHING I GUESS I WOULD PUT OUT THERE AS IF WE ARE GOING TO ASK FOR SOMETHING, THAT THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT I THINK WOULD BE A GOOD ASK. I KNOW THAT'S NOT A TREE OR BUSH IN TERMS OF THE COST AND THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE CAN KIND OF REALLY OFFICIAL ASK -- OR WE CAN'T MANDATE. IT'S A REAL ISSUE WITH THE INDUSTRY, THAT I THINK THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE PEOPLE CONNECTED TO THE INDUSTRY TAKE ON A MEANINGFUL WAY. IF I COULD ASK, THAT WOULD BE MY ASK. MY QUESTION WAS THE RENDERINGS, I AM CONFUSED ABOUT WHERE THE FRONT OF THE BUILDING IS. BECAUSE THE RENDERING THAT YOU ARE SHOWING WITH THE -- WITH THE BIG PANEL DOWN THE MIDDLE, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT, YOU KNOW, AGAIN, AS WE ARE THINKING TC-1 AND I NO KNOW TC-1 IS NOT THAT . IT'S JUST THAT WAY. AND STATE STREET IS KIND OF A MESS RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF PEDESTRIANS AND BIKES AND THINGS LIKE THAT. IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ARE HOPING TO BE ABLE TO TRANSFORM MORE, BECAUSE IT IS SO CONNECTED WITH TRANSIT. THAT I WOULD WANT THE BUILDING TO FEEL LIKE IT HAS A FRONT ON STATE. AND NOTUST A FRONT ON THE PARKING LOT. AND SO THE RENDERINGS THAT WERE SHOWED, IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO TELL WHAT IS GOING ON AND WITH THE STREET VIEW, CLEARLY THE -- THE GOOGLE STREET VIEW, CLEARLY THE WORK IS NOT DONE AND IT'S NOT KNOWN WHAT YOU ARE PLANNING FOR THE FACE. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE WATT STE STREET SIDE -- WHAT THE STATE STREET SIDE LOOKS LIKE. IS IN THE STA STREET SIDE OR IS THAT THE PARKING LOT SIDE? THE PETITIONER YES, T IMAGE PVID, THE IMAGE THAT IS SHOWN FING E PARKING LOT SIDE OF THE PROJEC
02:24:14.982: >> Comssior Gibb-Randall: SO -- DO YOU HAVE AN IMAGE OF WHAT IT'S GOING TO LIKE FACING STATE STREET?
02:24:20.721: >> IT'S A SIMILAR IMAGE THAT'S BEING SHOWN RIGHT NOW, BUT WITHOUT THE WOOD GRAIN FACADE.
02:24:28.128: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: SO MEANING IT'S JUST THE GRAY. DOES IT STILL HAVE THE -- THE KIND OF VESTIBULE -- DOES THE VESTIBULE CUT ACROSS THE WHOLE BUILDING OR IS THAT ONLY ON THE PARKING LOT SIDE? MY CONCERN IS THAT I WANT IT TO FEEL -- I WANT IT TO FEEL LIKE IT'S APPROACHABLE. BECAUSE RIGHT NOW, THERE IS A -- I NOTICE THERE'S A CONCRETE PATH GOING TOWARDS IT AND WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU TRY TO ENTER THERE? THE PATH GOES TO THE PARKING LOT AND THE FRONT OF THE BUILDING. SO THERE'S A PEDESTRIAN AROUND THE ENTIRE SIDE OF THE BUILDING.
02:25:14.508: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: SO IT'S A TEASER CONNECTION IN THAT WAY BECAUSE YOU THINK YOU ARE HEADING TOWARDS SOMETHING BUT YOU END UP WALKING AROUND THE BUILDING?
02:25:27.120: >> YES.
02:25:27.387: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: OKAY. SO I PRESUME THAT TWO POINTS OF ENTRY MAKE IT FEEL A LITTLE CONFUSING OR SECURITY-WISE THAT'S AN ISSUE. I GUESS THIS IS PART OF THE ISSUE, I GUESS WITH THESE PLACES THAT ARE SUPER CAR ORIENTED AND TRYING TO MAKE THEM MORE PEDESTRIAN ORIENTED. I KNOW THIS SECTION IN PARTICULAR IS TRICKY BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE HIGHWAY IN BETWEEN AND THAT'S PROBABLY WHY THE TC-IS ZONING TO STOPPED WHERE IT DID. I -- I WOULDN'T SAY HOW YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT THE BUILDING IN TERMS OF THE CIRCULATION BUT IN TERMS OF HOW THE FACADE IS TREATED, I WOULD LIKE THE SIDE TO FEEL LIKE IT'S REALLY READING FROM THE STREET THAT IT'S NOT THE BACK SIDE. THAT IT'S NOT THE -- THAT THE BUILDING ISN'T TURNING AWAY FROM THE ROAD. THAT WOULD BE MY COMMENT. I DON'T KNOW IF ANYBODY ELSE'S --
02:26:35.889: >> Chair Mills: IT LOOKS LIKE THE PETITIONER MAY HAVE SOME -- HAVE -- THE RESPONSE IS -- YOU HAVE OKAY WITH THAT COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL?
02:26:43.330: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: YEP.
02:26:44.164: >> AND YES, THERE ARE MORE COMPLEXITIES HERE BUT I WANTED TO CONFIRM WITH THE PETITIONER THAT WE DIDN'T SPEAK OUT OF TURN. WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO PUT A FACADE OPEN THE STATE STREET FACING PORTION, BECAUSE WE'RE PERFECTLY HAPPY TO MAINTAIN THE LOOK THAT THE OVERALL AREA. THERE'S SOME -- MAKING IT APPROPRIATE FOR OUR ACTUAL LAYOUT TO HAVE THE PARKING LOT FACING ACTUAL ENTRANCE JUST FOR MEANS OF SECURITY AND CHECKING FOLKS IN AND HAVING BOTH LIMITED AND SECURE ACCESS AREAS TO MOVE PEOPLE THROUGH THE ACTUAL TRANSACTION OF THE CANNABIS, BUT FOR THE PURPOSES OF EXTERIOR, IF YOU WANT TO PROVIDE A CONDITION OR WORK WITH WHAT THE OTHER THREE SIDES THAT WE ARE NOT LIE LHIGHLIGHTING IN OUR PRESENTATION, WE ARE WILLING TO WORK WITH YOU.
02:27:40.620: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: I WOULD LIKE FOR IT TO BE PRESENTABLE TO THE STREET AS WELL. AS SOMEBODY WHO DOES WALK AND BIKE A LOT THROUGH TOWN IS -- AND THIS WOULD BE A VERY MINOR CHANGE, BUT IF YOU ARE COMING FROM THE NORTH YOU WOULD OBVIOUSLY TAKE THE SIDEWALK ALONG RESEARCH PARK DRIVE AND THAT CUTS THAT DOWN. IF YOU ARE COMING FROM THE SOUTH, I WOULD RATHER WALK TOWARDS THE SIDE OF THE BUILDING AND GO AROUND TO THE QUOTE, FRONT ON THE PARKING LOT SIDE RATHER THAN HEAD TOWARDS THE MIDDLE OF THE BUILDING AND THEN WORK MY WAY AROUND BECAUSE THAT FEELS CIRCUITOUS AND NOT REAL IN TERMS OF WHAT IS HAPPENING THERE. THAT'S MY TWO CENTS ABOUT HOW IT WOULD FEEL TO EXPERIENCE IT. I GUESS IF YOU ARE AT THE HOTEL, YOU BE CUTTING ACROSS THE PARKING LOT. PEOPLE WALK DURING LUNCH AND THAT SORT OF THING. COULD BE A MINOR CHANGE THAT MAKES IT MORE REAL IN TERMS OF WHERE YOU ARE HEADING. I APPRECIATE THE WILLINGNESS TO MAKE THE STATE STREET SIDE --
02:28:59.633: >> THERE IS ALREADY, I BELIEVE, LIKE A SIDEWALK KIND OF ATTACHING ITSELF TO THE STATE STREET PORTION OF THE BUILDING. IN PAST, WE HAVE ANTICIPATED LESS -- PRESENTED SIDE OF THINGS LIKE ANTICIPATED SEATING OR SOMETHING ON THAT PORTION OF THE FACILITY. JUST FROM A PRACTICAL STANDPOINT. WE ANTICIPATE THE PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC TO BE FROM THE HOTEL SIDE. TO THE EXTENT YOU WANT IT TO LOOK GOOD FROM ALL FOUR SIDES, SO DO WE. AND WE WILL TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION.
02:29:33.567: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: THAT'S GOOD. WHEN I LOOK AT YOUR SITE PLAN, THERE'S A WALK TO WHAT WOULD BE HEADING TO THE CENTER OF THE BUILDING ELECTRIC STATE STREET AND THEN YOU MOVE AROUND THE BUILDING. IT'S MORE OF A STRAIGHT SHOT THAT CONNECTS INTO THAT SOUTHERN WALKWAY THAT HEADS TOWARDS THE LITTLE AREA TABLES AND THEN GO TO THE FRONT THAT IS NOT REALLY THE FRONT AND THEN MOVING AROUND. THIS IS CIRCUITOUS FROM THE SOUTH. SO JUST SOMETHING TO CONSIDER.
02:30:09.302: >> SURE AND WE WILL WORK WITH THE HOTEL. AS YOU CAN SEE, THERE'S ANOTHER SIDEWALK APPROACH, A LITTLE FARTHER SOUTH THAN THE ACTUAL PROPOSED RETAIL UNIT TOO, THAT'S HIGHLIGHTED HERE. WE CAN TRY TO MAKE CONDUCIVE TO TRY TO DRIVE A MORE APPROPRIATE THROW OF PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC IN THAT DIRECTION. WE HAVE TO ACCOUNT FOR OUR WASTE RECEPTACLE. WE WILL DO OUR BEST TO TAKE THOSE INTO CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
02:30:38.498: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: THANK YOU SO MUCH. AND THEN ONE OTHER THING AS I WOULD SAY AS THE PERSON WHO KNOWS ABOUT TREES ON THE COMMISSION IS THAT YOUR LITTLE ZONE WHERE YOU ARE SHOWING A FEW TABLES AND THINGS LIKE THAT, OUT NEAR THE PARKING LOT, YOU HAVE A SPOT THAT'S THERE AND ON THE LANDSCAPE, YOU HAVE SOME SHRUBS. YOU HAVE A LOT OF CANOPY TREES WHICH IS GREAT ALONG STATE STREET AND IF YOU MOVED ONE OF THOSE OVER ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THAT AREA, PEOPLE WOULD SILT THERE A -- SIT THERE A LOT MORE, BECAUSE IT WILL BE SHADED INSTEAD OF THE BLASTING SUN. THAT'S ANOTHER LITTLE SMALL THING THAT MIGHT -- IF THERE'S MINOR CHANGES BEING MADE THAT MIGHT MAKE IT MORE CONDUCIVE FOR PEOPLE TO HANG OUT THERE AND ENJOY IT OUT THERE. I'M DONE.
02:31:33.220: >> Chair Mills: COMMISSIONER SAUVE. I WILL COME BACK TO THIS.
02:31:37.390: >> Commissioner Sauve: I WILL JUMP IN REAL QUICK. LOOKING VERY DETAILED IN, I'M SEEING DOOR SWINGS ON THE BUILDING IN THE SITE PLAN IN DIFFERENT PLACES THAN HOW IT'S BUILT, RIGHT? LIKE, THERE IS A DOOR ON THE STATE STREET SIDE, IN THE SITE PLAN NOT ON THE SOUTH SIDE. SO I'M JUST KIND OF CURIOUS, FROM THE APPROVAL STANDPOINT, CAN 9 PROPOSED BUILDING ON THE SITE PLAN THAT THEY DO HAVE TO MEET, SINCE THE CONFIGURATION ON THE SITE PLAN IS DIFFERENT, LIKE, THE SIDEWALK IS PAVED DIFFERENTLY, LIKE, THERE SEEMS TO BE A LOT MORE CONTIGUOUS WALKS ON THE STATE STREET SIDE AS WELL FOR MORE TABLES AND THINGS THAT WE'RE NOT SEEING IN THE FINAL BUILD PROJECT. IT'S VERY BILL, BUT, YOU KNOW, IT -- IT'S AN THAT WE DID HAVE A DOOR ON STATE STREET IN THE PREVIOUSLY APPROVED SITE PLAN, THAT IS NOT BUILT AND SO CAN'T REALLY BE RECTIFIED AT THIS POINT BECAUSE WHERE THAT DOOR IS, IS ACTUALLY AN EGRESS STAIR FROM THE SECOND FLOOR. SO I GUESS FOR STAFF, LIKE, MAYBE JUST IN THE FUTURE WHEN WE LOOK AT THESE PLANS HOW MUCH CAN THAT FLOOR PLAN CHANGE?
02:33:04.778: >> AS FAR AS THE FLOOR PLAN GOES, THAT'S UP TO THE BUILDING DEPARTMENT. AS LONG AS IT'S IN THE SHELL AND THEY ARE NOT ADDING AN ADDITION ON, IT DOESN'T TRIGGER A SITE PLAN OR ADMINISTRATIVE AMENDMENT. SO THEY COULD GO THROUGH AND CHANGE THE LAYOUT OF THE FLOORS JUST WITH A BUILDING PERMIT.
02:33:21.728: >> Planning Manager:  AND I THINK THAT WOULD ALSO RELATE TO -- YOU KNOW, I DON'T -- SO I THINK WHEN THIS SITE PLAN CAME IN, CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG, CHRIS, PART OF -- PART OF THE DISCUSSION HERE, WAS REQUIRING THAT BUILDING TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A STREET PRESENCE, BECAUSE THE HOTEL ITSELF HAD IT MORE SET BACK AND PARKING IN FRONT OF IT. I THINK PART OF THAT IS THE DETAILS OF HOW THAT WOULD BE APPROVED. APPROVING A SITE PLAN THAT PUTS A BUILDING THERE, THEY HAVE -- THEY WOULD HAVE GENERALLY THE SAME OPTION TO DO THE INTERIOR RENOVATIONS AS ANYBODY ELSE. ONCE YOU STARTED, YOU KNOW, EXPANDING THAT OR SOMETHING THAT WOULD KICK IN. I THINK IT PROBABLY -- IT PROBABLY WARRANTS US THINKING ABOUT AS PART OF APPROVAL OR FUTURE REGULATIONS TO SAY IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO HAVE A BUILDING THERE. IT'S GOT TO HAVE THAT ENTRY WAY. YOU KNOW, THAT'S SOMETHING WE ADDRESSED IN THE PROPOSED TC-1 REGULATIONS BUT IT'S NOT BROADLY ACROSS OUR OTHER ZONING DISTRICTS. SO THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING WE WANT TO LOOK AT TO SAY THAT, NO -- OR CONVERSELY, THE PLANNING COMMISSION COULD DETERMINE AS PART OF THIS, THAT RECOGNIZING THERE'S LIMITATIONS. IT REFERS TO THE PEDESTRIAN VERSUS THE VEHICULAR. IS THE CIRCULATION GOING TO BE ADEQUATE? DOES IT MEET CITY GOALS? I WOULD SAY ANOTHER QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT IT'S MORE APPROPRIATE TO SIFT ALL THE ACCESS TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT -- SFT ALL THE ACCESS TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT BUILDING. IT'S MORE DIFFICULT FOR VEHICULAR USERS BUT THERE'S NOTHING, YOU KNOW -- THAT COULD BE A FACTOR IN YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE PERMIT. ABSENT THAT REGULATION OR A SPECIFIC CONDITION THAT THERE WOULD BE A MAINTAIN ENTRY AT THAT POINT, IT WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO ALTER THE DOOR ACCESS TO THAT BUILDING.
02:35:41.067: >> Commissioner Sauve: AND THE SIDEWALKS CAN BE ADDED?
02:35:44.871: >> Planning Manager:  I WOULD WANT T MOVE INTO THE DETAIL OF, YOU KNOW -- SOMETIMES ALREADY ADJUSTMENTS MADE DURING CONSTRUCTION. MAYBE IT'S A -- YOU KNOW -- SOMETIMES THERE'S A UTILITY BOX PLACED FOR WHATEVER IN ALACE. I WOULD HAVE TO DIVEORE INTO THIS,UT I WOULD HOPE THAT THE SIDEWALKS GENERALLY REFLECTED A SIMILAR PATTERN OR A QUANTY OF THE SITE PN.WHAT WAS APPVED IN
02:36:12.432: >> Commissioner uve: YEAH. REETAIL. ERE IS -- THERE'S A SECOND DOOR WCH I WOU ASSE IS A EGRESSTAIRS THAT CONNECTS TO TH KIND OF WING WALL, WHICHN SO IT'S HARD TO SEE WITH THE TREE CANOPY EXACTLY HOW MUCH IS PAVED FOR USABLE PATIO SPACE, BUT, YEAH. I GUESS IN MY OPINION, IT WOULD TAKE A LOT MORE TIME TO TRANSITIONING THIS AND DRIVING AROUND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO ACCESS THIS BUILDING. SO UNDERSTANDING EXISTING CONDITION AND TRY TO FILL IT, I'M OKAY WITH IT AS IS. BUT I THINK IT DOES -- THIS PROJECT BRINGS TO LIGHT A LOT OF KIND OF NUANCES THAT WE SHOULD KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR. AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO INCLUDE IN THE FUTURE SINCE WE'RE SEEING VARIATIONS FROM THE PREVIOUS TO WHAT'S BEEN BUILT. I THINK THAT'S WHERE I STAND NOW. I THINK I'M OKAY WITH THE PROJECT AS IS. YEAH. IT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF IT WAS BUILT AS WAS ON THE PLAN THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT.
02:37:32.979: >> Chair Mills: I'M GOING TO PUSH HARDER. I SEE THE PETITIONER'S HAND UP. I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE COMMISSIONER WYCHE, I SEE YOUR'S TOO. YOU MAY BE SITTING ON -- IN THIS ZOOM ROOM THINKING WHAT WAS PLANNING COMMISSION IN 2015 THINKING? AND I WAS ON PLANNING COMMISSION IN 2015 AND I REMEMBER HAVING A CONVERSATION ABOUT THE DOOR ON THE STREET. LIKE, AND IT'S SHOWN IN THE ELEVATION AND THERE'S A WHOLE LOT -- THERE'S SIGNAGE ON THE WEST ELEVATION SHOWN IN THE -- LIKE, SHOWN IN THE THING. THERE IS MUCH MORE DESIGN. THIS SERIOUSLY CONCERNS ME. LIKE, WE -- THIS WAS A POINT OF DISCUSSION THEN VERY ACTIVE POINT OF DISCUSSION TO SAY WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE WILL BE PEOPLE COMING IN AND PARKING ON THE EAST ELEVATION, BUT WE WANT THIS BUILDING FROM THE SIDEWALK, WE WANT PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO COME INTO IT FROM THE SIDEWALK. AND SO, LIKE, THISES NOT -- I MEAN I RECOGNIZE IT POSES AN ISSUE FOR THIS PARTICULAR USE, AND I DO WANT TO GET BACK TO THAT, BUT THIS IS A BIGGER -- AT LEAST PULLING UP THE STAFF RECORD FROM 2015, IT'S A PEREPET WALL. THERE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE TWO COLORS OF BRICK. IT WAS PRETTY AND IT'S NOT. LIKE, NO OFFENSE TO YOU. BUT BECAUSE -- AND I JUST WANT TO UNDERSCORE, LIKE THIS WAS ALL PART OF THAT DISCUSSION, AND SO I RECOGNIZE THAT THINGS INSIDE CAN MOVE, BUT WE -- IF THIS IS A FAILING OF OUR CODE, THAT WE DON'T -- THAT THE IDEA THAT LIKE -- THAT WHAT IS SHOWN IN ELEVATIONS. I REALIZE THAT SOME THINGS CAN CHANGE BUT IF THE AMOUNT OF GLAZING, IF THE FACT THAT THERE IS A FUNCTIONAL ENTRANCE AND WHAT READS AS LIKE -- THAT THERE'S SIGNAGE. IT'S MULTIPLE -- LIKE, THERE'S LOTS OF SIGNAGE ON THE ELEVATION. LIKE THAT'S NOT WHAT IS ACTUALLY BUILT, THAT'S PROBLEMATIC IN MY MIND, BEYOND WHAT IS BEING PROPOSED RIGHT NOW. SO WHAT WE'RE SEEING ON ELEVATIONS THAT'S NOT WHAT WE SHOULD EXPECT?
02:40:03.229: >> Planning Manager:  YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT FROM A STANDARDS GROUND. SO RIGHT NOW THE SITE PLAN --
02:40:08.067: >> Chair Mills: I CAN'T QUITE HEAR YOU. I WANT TO HEAR THIS PART.
02:40:12.572: >> Planning Manager:  WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ARE ARCHITECTURAL ASPECTS AND RIGHT NOW OUR U.D.C. DOESN'T ADDRESS ARCHITECTURE. YOU KNOW, IF THAT'S -- IF THAT IS A POLICY DIRECTION THAT THE PLANNING COMMISSION DESIRES TO GO TO, IT'S -- IT'S TRICKY BECAUSE IN ORDER TO BE DEFENSIBLE, IT HAS TO BE MEASURE ABLE AND ATTAINMENT AND AT TIMES IT CAN, I THINK, CAUSE AS MUCH BLANDNESS AND PREDICTABLE. YOU HAVE TO DESCRIBE INTENTION. I THINK THE BIGGER QUESTION THAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT, THOUGH, IS WHAT DECISIONS WERE MADE AS PART OF ITS RELATIONSHIP, OBVIOUSLY TO THE TRANSPORTATION NETWORK AND TO THE STREET? AND T TO THE PUBLIC? AND SO, YOU KNOW, I GUESS I WILL GO BACK TO YOU, CHRIS, DO YOU -- CAN YOU -- FROM THE PREVIOUS ASPECT, WHAT IS THE --
02:41:23.342: >> THAT'S WHAT I RECALL, THAT IT WAS A PLANNED PROJECT. WE REZONED IT TO C2B AND WE WANTED TO BRING THE BUILDING UP TO THE MINIMUM OF 10 FEET. AND SO THAT REALLY WAS AS -- IS PART OF THE REZONING TO BRING THAT BUILDING AS CLOSE AS WE COULD UP TO THE SIDEWALK BUT I CAN'T RECALL ANYTHING ABOUT, YOU KNOW, ENTRANCE LOCATION BUT IT WOULD MAKE SENSE THAT YES, YOU WANT TO HAVE A PEDESTRIAN CONNECTION.
02:41:58.878: >> Chair Mills: MAYBE IT WASN'T THIS PARTICULAR ONE. IT WAS MY EARLY DAYS ON PLANNING COMMISSION. THERE WERE A COUPLE OF THINGS BECAUSE IT WAS A RELATIVELY RECENT MOVE TO, LIKE, REQUIRE THINGS ON THE SIDEWALK. AND WE DIDN'T WANT THE BACKS TO BE THE SIDEWALK. LIKE, IT'S JUST -- IT'S THAT ELEMENT, AND IT'S NOT -- I MEAN, I DON'T -- I DON'T EXPECT THAT WE ARE PRESCRIBING -- I KNOW THAT NOT EVERYTHING IS FIGURED OUT, PARTICULARLY WHEN IT'S INSIDE, BUT THERE ARE SOME ELEMENTS THAT I'M NOT -- THAT -- THAT -- LIKE THIS, LIKE THE FACT THAT, LIKE, YOU KNOW, WE HAD SIDEWALKS AND FUNCTIONING DOORS AND SIGNAGE BEING LIKE, AND A DESIGN FEATURE THAT WAS INTENDED TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL, SHOWN TO US AND THAT IT DIDN'T GET BUILT IS DISAPPOINTING AND SO LIKE FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, WHAT IS THE OTHER -- I MEAN NOT -- APART FROM THE WHOLE, LIKE, GRASS VERSUS PAVERS THING, RIGHT, LIKE THIS IS -- WHICH IS ANOTHER ONE, BUT, LIKE, THIS IS -- THAT'S THE ASK I WOULD HAVE, IS TO MAKE THAT FACADE LIKE THE WAY IT WAS SUPPOSED TO LOOK WHICH IS NICER, WHICH IS WELCOMING FROM THE STREET, LIKE, I -- TO COMMISSIONER SAUVE'S POINT, I KNOW THAT'S NOT CHEAP. I GET THAT, BUT I'M ALSO -- I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY -- LIKE, THIS SEEMS LIKE A PRETTY BIG CHANGE FROM WHAT WE THOUGHT. COMMISSIONER -- OR MR. LENART AND THEN -- YEAH.
02:43:41.414: >> Planning Manager:  SO --
02:43:43.616: >> Chair Mills: I CAN'T HEAR YOU.
02:43:44.417: >> Planning Manager:  I THINK THERE'S TWO ASPECTS I'M HEARING FROM. ONE IS -- I THINK ONE FRANKLY IS ARCHITECTURE AND DESIGN AND MY UNDERSTANDING FROM THE PETITIONERS THEY'RE WILLING AND SORT OF INTERESTED IN SORT OF RESPONDING TO A BETTER STREET PRESENCE, I THINK JUST FROM THE DESIGN OF THE BUILDING. I THINK THE SECOND PIECE OF IT IS TO WHAT EXTENT DOES DESIGN OF THE BUILDING AND FUNCTIONALITY OF THE BUILDING MATTER TO THAT PRESENCE ON SOUTH STATE? AND I'M JUST LOOKING AT THE AT ORIGINAL APPROVE THAT WAS GRANTED AND IT IS SPECIFIC TO A REDUCTION OF FRONT SETBACK IN EXCHANGE FOR THE BENEFITS OF THE PLANNED PROJECTS. SO I THINK -- YOU KNOW, I THINK WHEN IT'S SILENT ON A SPECIFICITY, WE WILL DEFER AS STAFF AND IF THE QUESTION IS ASKED, I WILL SAY YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO WHAT IS AVAILABLE NO YOU IN ORDINANCE, THE SAME PREDICTIONS AND ANYTHING ELSE. ON THE FLIP SIDE, IF THIS WAS A SETBACK THAT ALSO CONDITIONED UPON REQUIRING A -- A FUNCTIONAL ACCESS TO THAT BUILDING AS WE ARE TRYING TO ASPIRE TO WITH TC, IS I WOULD THINK THAT THAT'S APPROPRIATE THAT THIS LAYOUT IS APPROPRIATE AND YOU ARE NOT MEETING THAT STANDARD. NOW, I FULLY -- I WANT TO FULLY ACKNOWLEDGE I THINK WHAT YOU MIGHT BE FEELING IN THE CONTEXT OF OUR REGULATIONS, YOU SORT OF FEEL LIKE -- AND I THINK YOU SORT OF FEEL LIKE YOU ARE PRESENTED SOMETHING AND OVER PROMISED AND UNDER DELIVERED AND I THINK THAT TELLS US, THIS IS ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY WHERE BASED ON THAT EXPERIENCE, IT MIGHT NECESSITY MORE REGULATION TO AVOID THAT IN THE FUTURE RATHER THAN PERHAPS RELIANCE ON -- THE RELIANCE ON THE PROPER OWNER.
02:45:41.634: >> Chair Mills: AND ALSO I WANT TO PUT IT IN THE CONTEXT OF TC-1, EVEN IF YOU REQUIRE A DOOR, IF IT'S LIKE A DOOR THAT HAS A SIGN ON, IT SAYING YOU CAN'T UNITED S USE THAT DOOR THT IN MY MIND --
02:45:56.048: >> Planning Manager:  IT'S FUNCTIONAL.
02:45:58.818: >> Chair Mills: I DON'T WANT IT TO BE THE FIRE EXIT, LIKE THE BACK SIDE. THAT DOESN'T MEET -- THAT'S COUNSELOR TO THE REASON THAT WE WANT A DOOR ON THAT STREET. SORRY. THANK YOU FOR POINTING OUT, COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL. BECAUSE THIS IS NOT WHAT WAS APPROVED. I SAW THE PETITIONER'S HAND UP. WHAT IS WORKABLE? WHAT IS POSSIBLE? YEAH.
02:46:26.378: >> COMMISSIONER, YOUR STATEMENTS ARE CERTAINLY UNDERSTOOD AND WE RESPECT THEM. LET ME, LIKE, JUST FOR CONTEXT REMIND OUR TIMELINE HERE. ORIGINALLY SITE PLAN ITEMS YOU ARE REFERRING TO WERE IN 2015. THAT WAS A YEAR BEFORE THE STATE OF MICHIGAN LEGALIZED OUR USE TYPE. THAT WAS THREE YEARS BEFORE THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR ALLOWED THIS USE TYPE IN 2018. SO PLEASE TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION, AS WELL AS THE FACT THAT WE ARE IN THE CB2 DISTRICT AND NOT THE TC1. WE ARE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU ON FACADE ISSUES, BUT PLEASE ALSO APPRECIATE IF YOU REVIEW THE SITE PLAN THAT OUR A.D.A. HANDICAPPED SPOTS ARE ON THE PARKING LOT SIDE. WHILE WE DON'T PLAN TO USE IT, BUT THE ELEVATOR ON THAT SIDE OF THE BUILDING. WE ANTICIPATE A.D.A. IS VERY IMPORTANT TO THEM. WE WOULD LOVE TO TAKE INTO REASONABLE SUGGESTIONS FOR WHATEVER FACADE COULD BE. WE ARE HAPPY TO TO PUT, FOR EXAMPLE, A TREE IN THE BACK OR CONSIDERATION FOR WHAT YOU MIGHT BE WILLING TO WORK WITH ON THE THREE SIDES OF THE BUILDING YOU ARE CONCERNED ABOUT FOR SITE FACTORS BUT PLEASE DON'T LOSE SIGHT OF THE FACT THAT SINCE 2015 TO 2021, THERE'S SIX YEARS OF CHANGE THAT WE HAVE TO CONSIDER, AS WELL AS THE USE TYPE THAT AT THE TIME YOU WERE REFERRING TO, SO SITE PLAN DISCUSSIONS THAT WERE OCCURRING, THE USE ITSELF WAS NOT EVEN LEGAL IN THE STATE OF MICHIGAN. SO WE HAVE CERTAINLY WANT TO EVOLVE WITH YOU, BE A PARTNER IN THE CITY AND MAKE SURE THE SITE IS BEST USED AS POSSIBLE, BUT WE ARE HERE TO REQUEST YOUR EFFECTIVE PERMISSION FORHE MARIJUANA PROVISIONING CENTER AND THAT HAS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF LIMITATIONS ON US, SIGNIFICANTLY FROM HOW CONSUMERS CAN ACTUALLY LEGAL OUR PROPERTY FROM STATE REGULATIONS STANDPOINT, THAT REALLY DRIVE OUR PRIMA EXIT BE THE PARKING LOT DE. SO PLEASE ALSOEEP TT IN MIND AS WE MOVEORWARD. WE ARE WILLING TO WK WH CONDIONSND HAPPY TOMPROVE SITES TOIND OF FD COMPMISE WE CAN ALLE HAPPY TH. THANK YOU
02:48:28.367: >> Cirills: I WOULD JT SAY,HISS ALSO -- RIGHT, ONE OFHE THINGS RUIRED IN A SPECL EXCEPON USE FOR MEDICAL MARIJUANA FACILITIES OR FOR MARIJUANA FACILITIES IS IT COMES WITH A SITE PLAN AND WHERE FOR SOME BUILDINGS THAT -- WHERE WE HAVE SUCH CENTERS HAVE BEEN BUILT A LONG TIME AGO AND THERE'S LOTS OF THINGS THAT, LIKE, NEED IMPROVEMENTS. THIS ONE WAS BUILT RELATIVELY RECENTLY. ANYWAY BEING LIKE, THAT'S JUST MY -- IN MY MIND, THAT'S WHAT I'M THINKING ABOUT, AS IT RELATES TO THIS PARTICULAR SITE. I'M ALSO -- I'M SAD THAT THIS BUILDING HAS SAT EMPTY FOR A WHILE. SO I'M EXCITED TO SEE IT ACTIVATED, BECAUSE IT'S BEEN EMPTY, I'M ALSO LIKE IT'S A SHAME THAT THERE'S NOTHING HAPPENING UPSTAIRS BECAUSE I ASSUME THAT THERE'S NO GOOD WAY TO GET UPSTAIRS -- LIKE SEPARATE THOSE. LIKE, AGAIN, I'M THINKING MAYBE -- IS THIS THE RIGHT USE FOR THIS PLACE? BUT I TALKED ENOUGH.
02:49:31.597: >> COMMISSIONER WYCHE.
02:49:34.366: >> THANKS. IS IT POSSIBLE FOR ME TO HAVE THE SCREEN SHARING ABILITY. I WANTED TO SHOW THE GOOGLE STREET VIEW BECAUSE I HAD A QUESTION. NOW IT'S ABLED. ALL RIGHT. I WILL SEE IF I CAN DO THIS CORRECTLY. IN SPITE OF MY COMPUTER SCIENCE AGREE, I MESS UP SCREEN SHARING IN ZOOM. SO THIS WAS THE SIDE THAT COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT. THIS IS THE STATE STREET-FACING SIDE OF THE BUILDING, CORRECT? EVERYBODY AGREE WITH THAT? SO WHAT I AM HEARING IS WE WANT A FUNCTIONAL DOOR WHICH WOULD BE ON THIS LOWER LEVEL, PROBLEM LITTLE JUST USING THIS AS A NORTHWEST AND SOUTHEAST, AT THIS POSITION, TO THE BEST HERE, ON THIS LOWER PLACEMENT AND THEN A FACADE, SOME KIND OF CHANGE TO THE EXTERIOR. BUILDING, SINCE IT'S THE STATE STREET FACING SIDE. BUT IT'S GOING TO BE OBSTRUCTED -- AND I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN SWITCH QUICKLY ENOUGH TO THE OTHER ALL RIGHT. I WILL CLOSE THAT AND RESHARE. THIS IS THE STATE STREET VIEW AGAIN AND THEN THERE ARE THESE THREE TREES PLUS THE STAYBRIDGE SORT OF THE SIGN THAT'S HERE. SO I WAS JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WE ARE ASKING THE PETITIONER TO FIX WITHIN THE SITE AND HOW THAT IS GOING TO RELATE TO S OUR APPROVAL OR DELY TONIGHT. IF SOMEONE COULD CLARIFY THAT FOR ME THAT, WOULD BE HELPFUL BECAUSE I'M -- YEAH, GO AHEAD.
02:51:42.428: >> Chair Mills: COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL, GO FOR IT.
02:51:43.595: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: I GUESS I'M -- AND WE MAY HAVE ON THE COMMISSION DIFFERENT OPINIONS ABOUT THIS. I THINK THAT -- I HERE WHAT THE PETITIONER IS SAYING. THEY NEED A SINGLE ENTRY. I WANT THE FACADE THAT'S FACING STATE STREET JUST TO LOOK MORE ENGAGING AND JUST NICER LOOKING AND THE PETITIONER SEEMS TO BE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THAT. WHAT I WAS ASKING FOR WAS THAT THIS SIDEWALK -- I CAN'T ANNOTATE IN THIS VERSION.
02:52:24.536: >> NO.
02:52:24.770: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: THAT IT BE MOVED FURTHER TO THE SOUTH SO THAT IT'S MORE DIRECTLY CONNECTED TO THE PATH THAT ACTUALLY GOES AROUND THE BUILDING RATHER THAN WIND ALL THE WAY AROUND IT. AB TAKES YOU WHERE YOU WANT TO GO SO IT'S CONNECTED INSTEAD OF YOU MOVING NORTH AND THEN MOVING SOUTH AND THEN GOING EAST, THAT YOU JUST KIND OF COME IN, SO THAT IT'S LEVEL WITH THAT. FACADE OF THE BUILDING. THAT'S WHAT I WAS SAYING. PEOPLE CAN HAVE DIFFERENT OPINIONS. I WANT THE FRONT OF BUILDING TO LOOK BETTER AND IT MIGHT BE LESS KIND OF CIRCUITOUS FOR THE PEDESTRIAN TO BE MORE CONNECTED TO THE SOUTH SIDEWALK. BUT, AGAIN, WE MAY HAVE DIFFERENT OPINIONS ABOUT THIS IN TERMS OF COMMISSIONER MILLS, YOU WERE KIND OF SAYING, MAYBE WE SHOULD HAVE DOOR ON THAT SIDE. I HEAR WHAT THEY ARE SAYING AROUND THE REGULATIONS AND STATE LEVEL AND THE SECURITY AND ALL THAT BUSINESS TOO. I HEAR THAT TOO. AND FOR WHAT THIS IS WORTH AGAIN -- I DON'T NECESSARILY WANT TO SCREEN SHARE. BUT THE ORIGINAL PLAN WAS THAT PERAPET WALL. WHERE SHE WANTS -- THERE WAS A DESIGN ELEMENT THAT WAS THERE AND THAT'S WHERE THE SIGNAGE WAS. SO THAT WAS THE ORIGINAL INTENT. DID YOU HAVE MORE COMMISSIONER WYCHE? OKAY. COMMISSIONER SAUVE.
02:54:06.972: >> Commissioner Sauve: I THINK I'M OKAY WITH THIS PROJECT. I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT FOR THE FUTURE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THIS. WHEN WE RESOLVE THIS, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT AREA HEIGHT AND PLACEMENT. WE CAN DO RENOVATIONS OF BUILDING AND REMOVE OTHER ENTRIES AND THINGS WITHOUT HAVING TO GO THROUGH THE WHOLE SITE PLANNING PROCESS THAT. WOULD BE A HUGE BURDEN. SO I GET THAT LIKE EVEN IN THIS TOWN THEY COULD HAVE PULLED -- LIKE THEY COULD HAVE BUILT IT AS IS AND PULLED A PERMIT, A BUILDING PERMIT TO RENOVATE THE FACADE AND PUT A DIFFERENT ENTRY IN OR CLOSE THINGS UP. LOOKING AT THE PREVIOUS FLOOR PLAN, THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY DID. THIS IS JUST HOW THEY BUILT IT, BUT I GUESS WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET DOWN TO, LOOKING AT THE APPROVED SITE PLAN, FOR AREA HEIGHT AND PLACEMENT, SUCH AS LIKE THE PARAPET AND IT SHOWS ADDITIONAL HEIGHT IN AN AREA, LIKE, WHAT -- WHAT SHOULD WE EXPECT AND APOLOGIZE TO THE PETITIONER. THIS IS A DEVIATION OF THE CONVERSATION. I THINK IT HELPS FOR THIS EVALUATION SO WE ALL FEEL CONFIDENT ABOUT, YOU KNOW, WHAT OUR FINAL VOTE IS THEN THE FUTURE ONES WHAT SHOULD WE EXPECT TO EVALUATE WHEN WE LOOK AT BUILDING FLOOR PLANS RELATIVE TO AREA HEIGHT AND PLACEMENT. PROBABLY LIKE THE FULL FOOT PRINT BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HEIGHT, AND THIS SHOWS THIS THINGS HIGHER THAN OTHERS. ARE WE TALKING ABOUT HEIGHT LIMIT? ARE WE TALKING ABOUT A TOLERANCE IN THE SQUARE FOOTAGE? PA>> Planning Manager:  SO OUR AREA HEIGHT AND PLACEMENT, IT SPECIFIES HEIGHT. YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. WE PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY WITHIN THOSE AREA HEIGHT AND PLACEMENTS TO MAKE MODIFICATIONS. YOU KNOW, IF I WOULD SUGGEST THE PROPOSAL AS ORIGINALLY PRESENTED THAT HAD AN ENHANCED HIGHER PARAPET WALL AT THE SOUTHWEST PORTION OF THE BUILDING, ON WHAT STANDARDS WOULD THAT BE APPROVED AND WHAT STANDARDS WOULD YOU REJECT IT? DOES IT MEET THE HEIGHT REQUIREMENT? DOES IT MEET THE SETBACK REQUIREMENT? WE MAKE CHANGES BASED ON THE U.D.C. WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH MODIFICATIONS? WHAT CAN YOU DO WITHOUT MODS? AND IN THIS CASE, I THINK PROBABLY -- AND CONTROL THE ANALYSIS OF THIS, BUT WHAT YOU SEE IN DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS, WE INCLUDE LANGUAGE THAT SAYS YOU WILL BUILD THIS ARCHITECTURALLY LIKE YOU PRESENT, HOWEVER, IF YOU WANT TO MAKE CHANGES, YOU WILL PRESENT THEM TO STAFF AND STAFF WILL DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE MINOR OR DEEMED SIGNIFICANT. I WILL TELL YOU THAT GENERALLY THEY TEND TO BE MINOR BECAUSE THE PROPOSED CHANGES ARE WITHIN THOSE AREA HEIGHT PLACEMENTS. THEY ARE NOT CHANGING THE HEIGHT LIMIT. THEY ARE NOT CHANGING THE SETBACKS. THEY ARE NOT CHANGING THE FLOOR AREA BECAUSE ALL OF THOSE THINGS WOULD TRIGGER A KNEW SITE PLAN REVIEW. SO THEY TEND TO BE MINOR IN NATURE. I THINK TO THE EXTENT THAT WE ARE MAKING DECISIONS RELYING UPON THOSE ASPECTS. I THINK THOSE SHOULD BE LOOKED AT MORE CAREFULLY. WHEN WE ARE NOT, WHEN THOSE AREN'T KEY COMPONENT TO IT, WHEN YOU ARE MAKING A DECISION ON A SITE PLAN THAT IS VERY MUCH USE BASED AND THERE'S NO CONDITIONS RELATED TO THAT IT'S GOING TO BE EASIER, I WOULD SAY FOR ME TO CONCLUDE THAT THOSE CHANGES ARE INSIGNIFICANT. IF THIS APPROVAL SAID THAT AS PART OF THE PLAN PROJECT IN EXCHANGE FOR A REDUCED SETBACK FOR THE RETAIL BUILDING AND ENTRY TO IT, THAT WOULD BE A CLEAR INDICATION THAT THAT WAS PART OF IT. OBVIOUSLY THAT WAS THE INTENTION THIS, BUT THE DETAILS OF THOSE REGULATIONS AND WHAT OUR CODE ALLOW AND DON'T ALLOW MATTER CONSEQUENTLY TO THOSE EXHIBITIONS.
02:58:28.767: >> Commissioner Sauve: AND I GUESS LOOKING AT THE MATERIAL -- LIKE, THERE'S MULTIPLE MATERIALS AND NOW WE HAVE A BLOCK WALL.
02:58:35.073: >> Planning Manager:  YEP.
02:58:36.474: >> Commissioner Sauve: AND ONLY IN THE DOWNTOWN DISTRICT WHERE WE HAVE THE DESIGN GUIDELINES ON TOP OF IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN REGULATE, BUT OUTSIDE OF THAT DESIGN GUIDELINE DISTRICT, THAT JUST --
02:58:47.085: >> Planning Manager:  CORRECT.
02:58:48.420: >> Commissioner Sauve: SO EVEN IF IT'S ON THE SITE PLAN, IT COULD CHANGE AND WE COULD SEE SOMETHING LATER BECAUSE THAT'S DIFFERENT?
02:58:54.960: >> Planning Manager:  IT'S JUST LIKE YOU SAID, BECAUSE WE DON'T SET THAT STANDARD -- WE DON'T WANT TO APPLY THAT STANDARD DIFFERENTLY TO A PLAN THAT'S APPROVED VERSUS A BUILDING THAT IS THERE. I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE EQUITABLE TO SAY YOU ARE APPROVED BUT NOT BUILT. WE ARE HOLDING TO YOU THIS STANDARD. BUT IF YOUR BUILDING IS ALREADY BUILT, IT'S A DIFFERENT STANDARD.
02:59:22.787: >> Commissioner Sauve: OKAY.
02:59:23.388: >> Planning Manager:  I THINK IT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND, IF THAT'S A DESIRE, I THINK WE SHOULD LOOK AT CODE CHANGES THAT MEMORIALIZE THAT MORE SPECIFICALLY. THERE'S A CERTAIN NUMBER OFMATEE OF PLANE AND A CERTAIN VARIABILITY OF THE HEIGHT BUT IN ORDER TO MEET THOSE, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO DEFINE SOMETHING MEASURABLE. #. THAT'S HELPFUL, BETWEEN THE ARCHITECTURE AND THE SITE PLAN, FROM THE OTHER SIDE. I HOPE THAT HELPS WITH OTHER PEOPLE. THIS IS A GOOD MASTER CLASS TO GO THROUGH IT SCENARIO. SO THANK YOU.
03:00:13.838: >> Chair Mills: WAS THERE QUESTIONED OR ANYTHING ELSE THAT WAS UNRESOLVED COMMISSIONER SAUVE? OKAY. ANY OTHER COMMISSIONERS HE ESTIONS OR DISCUSSION? MR. LENART, GO AHE. SIFT PROJECT A LITTLE T THAT THER ISNOH QSTION ABOUT THE PSENCF THA BUILDING O UTH STATE. THE CIRCULATION OF PEDESTRIANS, IF IT'S ONLY THE BACK, IT MIGHT WARRANT THE PETITIONER TO RESPOND TO THOSE THINGS AND GIVE YOU SPECIFIC INFORMATION ABOUT HOW THEY MIGHT ALTER THAT ELEVATION ON SOUTH STATE, AND HOW THEY MIGHT LOOK AT SIDEWALK AND WHAT HAVE YOU. I WOULD -- FROM MY OBSERVATION, THERE'S -- A SENSING ENOUGH QUESTION AND UNCERTAINLY FROM THE PLANNING COMMISSION, NOT THAT YOU ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE USE BUT YOU WANT MORE DETAILED ABOUT DETAILS BEFORE YOU TAKE ACTION. I THINK A POSTPONEMENT MAY ORDER FOR THIS ONE.
03:01:37.922: >> Chair Mills: I SEE THE PETITIONER'S HAND. PARTICULARLY IF IT'S TO THIS ISSUE ABOUT WHAT YOU ARE HEARING FROM US, GO FOR IT.
03:01:54.172: >> OBVIOUSLY OUR GOAL IS TO OPEN AND OPERATE. WE ARE HAPPY TO ACCEPT CONDITIONS TO MAKE COMMITMENTS TO FACADE SIDEWALK CHANGE, LANDSCAPING. WE WOULD MUCH PREFER YOU TELL US EXACTLY WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO -- AND HOLD US TO COMMITTING TO THOSE CONDITIONS AND ALLOW US TO MOVE FORWARD AT A FASTER RATE THAN FOR COME BACK.
03:02:15.794: >> YOU WANT US TO IMPROVE THE FACADE AND ADDRESS -- IF THERE'S A WAY THAT YOU CAN PUT THOSE CONDITIONS ON TO AN APPROVAL, THAT WOULD BE OUR PREFERENCE. SURE OF THAT, OBVIOUSLY WE WOULD RATHER HAVE MORE TIME TO ADDRESS THAN BE DENIED. WE WOULD PREFER TO HAVE A CONDITIONAL APPROVAL WITH DEFINED GOALS FOR US TO MEET AS OPPOSED TO PUSHING THIS ANOTHER MEETING. CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT WE HAVE BEEN ON THE PROVISIONING SIDE IN THE QUEUE AND WAITING SINCE 2018. WE ARE READY TO OPERATE AND VERY EXCITED TO DO THAT AND HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE CITY TO MEET ALL OF THOSE CONCERNED AND ANY OTHER YOU THINK ARE REASONABLE APPROPRIATE TO ADDRESS YOUR OVERALL SITE CONCERNS HERE TONIGHT.
03:03:09.647: >> Chair Mills: AND JUST FOR WYCHE THERE ARE THINGS THAT ARE ADDED ON AS CANS TO OUR -- THIS IS AN APPROVED SUBJECT TO X, Y, AND Z AND HESS TORICAL ON SOME OF THE SPECIAL -- HISTORICAL SPECIAL EXCEPTION USES, INITIALLY THAT WAS DONE WITH HOURS OF OPERATION. SOMETIMES IT'S MORE APPROPRIATE TO POSTPONE THINGS AND LET THE PETITIONER FIGURE IT OUT AND COME BACK TO US WITH THE PROPOSAL. THAT'S EFFECTIVELY WHAT -- TRANSLATING, THAT'S WHAT I JUST HEARD. I'M GOING TO CONFESS -- THIS CHANGED MY THOUGHT ABOUT OUR PROCESSES OVERALL, ITS NOT ABOUT THIS. SO COMMISSIONER SAUVE'S POINT, IT'S NOT ABOUT THIS. IT'S MAKING SURE THAT, LIKE OUR GOALS OF MOVING THINGS UP SO THEY CAN BE ACCESSED FROM THE STREET. CONTINUE, LIKE OUR -- THEY ARE ACTUAL LeUSED THAT WAY AND I -- ARE ACTUALLY USED THAT WAY. IT'S JUST -- I'M SPEECHLESS -- WELL, NOT QUITE SPEECHLESS BECAUSE THAT'S A BIG PART OF OUR OVERALL GOALS IN THE CITY, AND FIGURING OUT WE CAN MAINTAIN THAT, I THINK IS IMPORTANT. SO LCERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT IMPROVED THAT FACADE, I WOULD BE SUPPORTIVE OF TO MAKE IT LOOK NOT SUCH LIKE A BACK BUT AT THE SAME POINT NOT CONFUSE PEOPLE. WE STARTED THIS CONVERSATION, COMMISSIONER, DISCH WITH YOU SAYING WHAT MIGHT THAT BE? HEARING THIS CONVERSATION, I WILL PUT IT BACK ON YOU. IN HEARING WHAT -- YOU KNOW, LOTS OF DIFFERENT IDEAS, DO YOU HAVE -- OR ANYONE ELSE HAVE THOUGHTS? EVEN EITHER COMMISSIONER DISCH OR MR. LENART.
03:05:25.450: >> Councilmember Disch: I WANT TO KNOW HOW HE FOUND AT DRESS ON STATE STREET SO HE CAN LOOK THAT UP ON GOOGLE STREET VIEW. THE PICTURE YOU SHOWED US MADE ME UNDERSTAND WHAT COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL WAS TALKING ABOUT THE TEASER SIDEWALK. I THINK MOVING THAT WOULD BE SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT WALKS YOU UP TO THE BUILDING AS IF YOU ARE GOING TO GET INTO A DOOR AND YOU GET UP TO WHAT LOOKS LIKE A REGISTER FOR ELECTRICITY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT FOR SOME SORT OF METER AND YOU ARE JUST STANDING IN FRONT OF A GLASS PANE. THAT'S NOT VERY DESIRABLE. AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANTED TO -- I DON'T KNOW COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL, YOU WERE SUGGESTING PUTTING SOME AMENITIES ON THAT SIDE SO PEOPLE WANTED TO NOT AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THE COURTYARD THAT AT THE HOTEL ACROSS THE PARKING LOT BUT EXIT THE BUILDING IN THE PARKING LOT BUT COME AROUND TO THE STATE STREET SIDE, AND HAVE SOME SEATING. I WASN'T SURE WHEN PETITIONER MENTIONS, SEATING ON THE STATE STREET SIDE THAT. MIGHT BE REALLY NICE. THAT WOULD GO A LONG WAY TO MAKE THAT A MORE HOSPITABLE, AND VARYING THE COLOR OF THE BRICK WOULD BE REALLY TERRIFIC. SO THE THREE THINGS ARE A FACADE IMPROVEMENT. IF YOU COULD PUT A BOX AROUND THAT ICKY REGISTER. YOU KNOW, JUST BECAUSE IT'S JUST LIKE -- YOU KNOW, I MEAN WE'RE NOT IN PARIS. SO LET'S MAKE THINGS LOOK FINISHED ON THE OUTSIDE. AND MOVING THE SIDEWALK. THOSE ARE THESE PLUS A TINY ONE WHICH IS MAKE THAT REGISTER THING NOT LOOK SO SUN DEVIL. IT'S GREAT FOR AND I APPRECIATE COMMISSIONER SAUVE MENTIONING HOW DIFFICULT IT WOULD BE TO REORIENT THIS PROJECT. SO THOSE WOULD BE THINGS THAT I WOULD ASK FOR AND I SAW YOU WANTED TO SAY SOMETHING, MR. COPENHAVER.
03:08:05.376: >> NO, ACTUALLY, WE WERE LOOKING AT THE SITE AND DISCUSSING DIRECTLY ME AND THE PETITIONER. WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO -- INSTEAD OF REMOVING THAT SIDEWALK, TURNING IT IN A SEATING AREA, PLACING SOMETHING TO DIRECT THE FLOW OF TRAFFIC AND INSTEAD OF NECESSARILY RIPPING SOMETHING OUT, BUT MAKING IT USABLE. WE ARE WILLING TO OBVIOUSLY, AS I PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED, HEAR YOUR SPECIFIC CONCERNS OR IDEAS ABOUT WHAT WE COULD DO BUT SUFFICE IT TO SAY, IF YOU WHAT. TO PUT A BIKE RACK OR MAYBE SOME LANDSCAPING BACK THERE TO DETER BUILDING OR SOMETHING, WE ARE HAPPY TO DO WHATEVER YOU THINK IS APPROPRIATE. IF WE COULD CLEARLY DESIGN WHAT TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS. IT WOULD ALLOW US TO FOCUS ON WHAT THE GOAL IS TO GET IN THE STATE PORTION OF THE VIEW AND COMPLIANCE AND SAFETY ISSUES. WE ARE HAPPY TO PUT ALL OF THAT ON THE TABLE AND WORK WITH YOU THERE. SO THANK YOU.
03:09:11.476: >> Chair Mills: COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL.
03:09:16.581: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: I WAS REFERRING TO A PATIO IN THE CURRENT PROPOSED SITE PLAN THAT IS AT THE JUNCTION OF THE SOUTHEAST CORNER OF THE BUILDING. SO THERE'S AN EXISTING LITTLE PATIO AND IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S SOME, YOU KNOW, TABLE AND CHAIRS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. SO I SAW IT IN THERE. IT LOOKS HOT AND DRY. AND I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, MOVING ONE OF THOSE TREES OVER THERE IS A NICE THING. FOR ME, IT'S A PRETTY CLEAR THING IN TERMS OF WHAT I FEEL LIKE I WOULD BE ASKING FOR. I WOULD BE COMFORTABLE WITH MOVING AHEAD OF THIS. WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF JURISDICTION ON WHAT THE BUILDING LOOKS LIKE ANYWAY. YOU COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT THE CITY COUNCIL -- I DON'T KNOW DOES CITY COUNCIL LOOK AT? YOU WOULD HAVE TO WORK WITH STAFF TO COME UP WITH THE FACADE AND YOU ARE NOT WALKING AROUND IN A CIRCUITOUS WAY AND IF YOU WANT TO MOVE A TREE, THAT'S GREAT. IT'S NOT PAY BIG HANG-UP FOR ME. BUT IT WOULD MAKE IT MORE COMFORTABLE FOR PEOPLE AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU KIND OF PROBABLY WOULD SEE AS YOU ARE WALKING UP THE SIDEWALK TO SAY, HEY, YOU KNOW, THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON OVER THERE, THAT WOULD SORT OF DRAW YOU IN. SO THOSE ARE THE -- AND I LIKE THE IDEA OF, YOU KNOW, SCREENING THE UGLY UTILITIES. I FEEL THEY ARE PRETTY ACCOMPLISHABLE IN TERMS OF US MOVING FORWARD WITHOUT US SEEING WHAT YOUR PATIO FURNITURE LOOKS LOOK AND WHAT THE BUILDING -- YOU KNOW, I FEEL LIKE -- THESE ARE PRETTY STRAIGHT FORWARD THINGS. YOUR WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH THIS IS OBVIOUS AND I WOULD TRUST STAFF TO WORK OUT WITH YOU. THAT'S HOW I FEEL.
03:10:56.280: >> Chair Mills: COMMISSIONER COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT AND THEN COMMISSIONER DISCH.
03:11:00.751: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: ANOTHER THING I WANT TO ADD. AND LIGHTING. I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE LIGHTNING IS, PARTICULARLY FOR THAT SIDEWALK IF WE WANT TO DIRECT PEOPLE FROM STATE STREET AROUND TO THE BACK, YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH MORE OF THAT TOO, IF IT'S REALLY WELL LIT.
03:11:24.842: >> Chair Mills: COMMISSIONER DISCH, GO AHEAD.
03:11:27.178: >> Councilmember Disch: SORRY, I WASN'T SURE. SO I'M SEEING NOW THE SEATING THAT COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL WAS TALKING ABOUT. I REALLY LIKED WHEN YOU SUGGESTED PUTTING A BIKE RACK ON THE SOUTH STATE -- ON THE STATE STREET SIDE AND PUTTING SEATING THERE AND I WOULDN'T MIND EVEN IF YOU JUST REORIENTED THE OUTDOOR SEATING AND THE MADE THE PATIO ON THE STATE STREET SIDE. THEN WHAT YOU ARE SAYING THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO DRIVE HERE BUT THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE WHO MIGHT WALK HERE OR BIKE HERE AND THEY WILL COME BACK AND GET THEIR VEHLE, WHICH IS THEIR BICYCLE AND INVITE THEM TO HAVE A SEAT AND, YOU KNOW ENJOY A LITTLE TIME OR EAT A SANDWICH. I DON'T KNOW. THE IDEA OF OUTDOOR SEATING ON THE EDGE OF A PARKING LOT, IT'S NOT VERY APPEALING. SO YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE THERE IS GRASS IN FRONT. ITS A WAY OF WELCOMING A DIFFERENT TYPE OF VISITOR TO THE BUILDING.
03:12:45.356: >>hair Mills: MR. NART
03:12:45.923: >> Planninganager:  T THINGS. I'M HAY  WORK WITH THE HEATER O CDITISS SPECIED -- THE PETITIONER ON IANT TO BE CLEAR THEN, YOU ARE LEAVING SOME OF THAT DISCRETION TO ME RATHER THAN TO YOU. I'M HAPPY TO DO THAT. I DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE PROPERTY LINE ACTUALLY FOLLOWS PRETTY PROXIMATE TO THE BUILDING. THE BUILDING IS ONLY 5 FEET OFF THE PROPERTY LINE. SO WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE STATE STREET SIDE, I WANT TO BE MINDFUL, THERE MAY BE LIMITATIONS ON WHAT CAN HAPPEN IN THE RIGHT-OF-WAY, BOTH FROM -- FEATURE PENDING ON WHERE THE S UTILITY STRUCTURES ARE PLACED BUT TO BE CLEAR, I'M HAPPY TO WORK THROUGH THE BEST SOLUTIONS THAT WE CAN COME TO, BUT I ■WANTTOI WANTEDTORAISE THAT ASPECT AS WELL.
03:13:41.712: >> Councilmember Disch: OKAY. SO A CHURCH PEW.
03:13:44.115: >> Chair Mills: TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE -- SO I THINK THAT THIS WILL ALL HELP ACCOMPLISH THE GOALS OF A BETTER CONNECTION AND A BETTER VIEW FROM STATE STREET SO I'M SUPPORTIVE OF THAT I'M SUPPORTIVE OF STAFF WORKINGG WITHIN THE CONFINES. WHAT I HEARD AND ARTICULATING -- BECAUSE WE WOULD NEED PRESUMABLY A MOTION TO AMEND THIS. SO ADD ADDITIONAL ONE OTHER CONDITION TO THE PROPOSAL. THE THINGS I HEARD WERE REALIGNING THE SIDEWALK FROM STATE STREET ADDING SOME SORT OF SEATING, IDEALLY. THIS IS WHERE THE BENCH OR THE BICYCLE PARKING MAY BE ACTIVATING THAT FACADE AND SOME SORT OF IF  FACADE IMPROVEMENT D WHAT I HEARD FROM COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL IS MAYBE MOVING A TREE BUT MAYBE NOT.
03:14:54.952: >> Planning Manager:  ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THE WEST FACADE OR THE WEST AND NORTH SIDES?
03:15:12.203: >> Chair Mills: I MOST CARE ABOUT THE SOUTHWEST. IT'S CLOSER TO THE DOOR, THE PATH. PL>> Planning Manager:  YEAH, I THINK THOSE WOULD BE GREAT.
03:15:28.185: >> WHAT ABOUT LIGHTING?
03:15:32.556: >> Chair Mills: I HAD LIGHTING.
03:15:35.359: >> Commissioner Sauve: THE HOURS OF OPERATION ARE AFTER DARK.
03:15:42.233: >> Chair Mills: DARK SKIES COMPLIANT LIGHTING.
03:15:46.704: >> Planning Manager:  WHAT I WOULD SUGGEST IS -- WE DON'T HAVE THE REVISED OUTDOOR LIGHTING AND YOU -- TO THE PETITIONER, I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT IT'S PRESCRIBING CERTAIN LIGHTING TEMPERATURE, SPECTRUM, SHIELDED FIXTURES AND WHEN THE BUSINESS IS CLOSED, YOUR LIGHTING FIXTURES ARE CLOSED. SO.
03:16:18.502: >> WE ARE PROPERLY FINE WITH THAT, IF IT CHANGES, THE FINAL VERSION IS WITHIN REASON? IS THAT MADE CLEAR. WE'RE HAPPY TO COMPLY WITH THAT OBVIOUSLY. I DON'T WANT TO COMPLY WITH SOMETHING THAT WILL DRASTICALLY CHANGE IF IT'S STILL IN DESIGN, THAT'S ALL.
03:16:34.585: >> Planning Manager:  WE WILL STIPULATE THE CONDITION -- I THINK THE CONDITIONS SHOULD -- I WOULD SUGGEST TO COMPLY WITH THAT ORDINANCE AS IT WAS CURRENTLY -- IT'S IT'S CURRENTLY CONSIDERED. WITH HAVE A SNAPSHOT OF THAT THAT WAS CONSIDERED AT CITY COUNCIL. WE CAN PROVIDE THAT TO THE PETITIONER SO THAT THEY HAVE -- THAT'S CLEAR AND IT WOULD BE REFLECTIVE OF THIS ITERATION OF IT.
03:16:59.276: >> OKAY. PERFECTLY REASONABLE. WE ARE HAPPY TO -- THAT'S PERFECTLY FINE. THAT'S DRE ADDRESSES MY CONCERN. I'M FAIRLY FAMILIAR WITH IT.
03:17:12.589: >> Planning Manager:  ARE WE TALKING ABOUT THE ENTIRE SITE OR THE ELEMENTS THAT WOULD BE ALTERED AS PART OF THIS SIDEWALK AREA RECONFIGURATION.
03:17:23.233: >> Commissioner Sauve: I DON'T THINK I STUDIED IT ENOUGH TO SAY WHAT THE LIGHTING PLAN WAS BUT I WOULD BE TO MAKE IT DARK STAR COMPLIANCE BUT ESPECIALLY ENHANCED AROUND THE FRONT SIDEWALK AREA.
03:17:36.046: >> Planning Manager:  SO THE PROPOSED MOTION IS TO MODIFY THE SITE PLAN, ADDITIONAL CONDITION ON THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION TO WORK WITH STAFF TO MAKE THE FOLLOWING MODIFICATIONS, MOVE THE SIDEWALK TO THE SOUTH AS IT CONNECTS TO THE SOUTH STREET FOR A MORE DIRECT ROUTE AND SEEK TO SCREEN THE UTILITIES IN AN IMPROVED FASHION, AND LOOK TO IMPROVE THE WEST FACADE, AND ANY LIGHTING AS PART OF THIS WORK WITH BE DARK SKY COMPLIANT AND INVESTIGATE OTHER PEDESTRIAN OR NON-MOTORIZED AMENITIES AT THE SOUTHWEST PORTION OF THE BUILDING TO -- TO ENCOURAGE MORE ACCESSIBILITY AND, I GUESS A DESIRE FOR THAT MODE OF TRAVEL TO THAT BUILDING IS THAT -- IS ANYBODY MOVING THAT?
03:18:23.260: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: AND JUST KEEPING IN MIND THE DUMPSTERS ARE THERE LIKE THE PETITIONER SAID. SO AS YOU ALL ARE FIGURING THAT ALL OUT.
03:18:30.768: >> I ACTUALLY HAD JUST A SLIGHT QUESTION. SORRY. I DIDN'T --
03:18:34.571: >> Chair Mills: I WAS GOING TO SNEAK YOU IN BEFORE -- GO AHEAD.
03:18:37.875: >> I HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT THE SITE PLAN THE WHOLE TIME, AND AS I'M LOOKING AT IT, THE POSITION OF DUMPSTERS DON'T CONFORM TO THE SITE PLAN. THEY ARE OPEN TOWARDS THE BUILDING BUT IN THE SITE PLAN, THERE'S A WALL AND THEN A GATE OR A FENCE SO THE SOUTH. AND PART OF WHAT I'M WONDERING -- I'M NOT YET PROPOSING NOT GUILTY. I'M WONDER -- ANYTHING. I'M WONDERING AS WE WALK THROUGH THE LIST OF CONDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS IS IT POSSIBLE TO JUST ASK THEM TO DO WHAT IS IN THE ACTUAL SITE PLAN AS SOON AS THERE WAS A DEVIATION AND CORRECT THINGS BACK BECAUSE THAT WOULD PUT THE DUMPSTERS IN THE RIGHT POSITION AND PUT THE PATIO WHERE WE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING IT WOULD PUT THE SIDEWALK WHERE IT WAS IN THE SITE PLAN AND THEN ALL THE OTHER CONDITIONS FOR LIGHTING AND THE FACADE WOULD BE CAPTURED? AM I UNDERSTANDING THIS CORRECTLY BECAUSE EVERYBODY'S FACES JUST CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY AND I CAN'T READ YOUR FACES YET BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW YOU PERSONALLY. [ LAUGHTER ]
03:19:45.342: >> Planning Manager:  I WOULD SAY THAT'S POSSIBLE. I WOULD ASK SOME -- I WOULD ASK SOME CONVEYANCE OF AUTHORITY TO ME TO MAKE THE FINAL DETERMINATION --
03:19:58.522: >> YES, I HAVE NO OBJECTION TO THAT.
03:19:59.756: >> Planning Manager:  YEAH.
03:20:00.824: >> AND I WASN'T EVEN PROPOSING ANYTHING. I WAS ACTUALLY JUST ASKING A QUESTION.
03:20:04.161: >> Planning Manager:  THE SHORT AN ANSWER IS YOU COULD ANI WOULD WANT TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH THE SOLID WASTE STAFF TO MAKE SURE THAT CHANGES WERE MADE FOR SOME REVISION TO THEIR STANDARDS AND IMPROVE THE FUNGIONALITY.
03:20:18.809: >> OKAY.
03:20:19.076: >> Planning Manager:  BUT THE SHORT IS YES, YOU CAN DO THAT.
03:20:22.312: >> IT LOOKS LIKE EVERYTHING THAT WE ARE ASKING FOR WAS IN THE PLAN. THEY JUST DIDN'T DO IT. IT GETS US ALL THE WAY BACK -- WHAT IS THE MOVIE WHERE THEY START AT THE END AND MOVE ALL THE WAY FORWARD. IT GETS US BACK TO WHAT COMMISSIONER DISCH SAID AT THE BEGINNING SOMETHING WE HAVE A SITE THAT WAS BUILT BUT DOESN'T CONFORM TO THE PLAN, WHAT DO WE DO IF WE HAVE OBJECTIONS? AND SO HAVING LISTENED TO THE CONVERSATION AND CONTINUING TO LOOK AT THE SITE PLAN, IF THEY WOULD JUST DO WHAT'S IN THE SITE PLAN, I THINK IT WOULD ACCOMPLISH A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF WHAT WE ARE ASKING AND THEN IT DOESN'T FEEL SO ARBITRARY ALSO. IT'S RIGHT HERE. THEY SCOPED IT OUT. THEY PUT IN THE MEASUREMENTS BUT THEN THEY DIDN'T BUILD IT THAT WAY. AM I READING THAT CORRECTLY?
03:21:11.595: >> Planning Manager:  WE CAN FIND A BETTER SPOT ON THE SITE ALL TOGETHER THAT WOULD OPEN UP MORE FLEXIBILITY FOR THAT CORNER.
03:21:27.811: >> THANK YOU.
03:21:28.178: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: IS THE SITE PLAN FROM 2015?
03:21:31.415: >> YES, WHEN YOU GO TO LEGISTAR, IT LISTED ALL THE ATTACHMENTS AND I HAVE OPENED THE STAYBRIDGE AND I HAVE CONTROLLED DOWN WHERE THERE'S RENDERS OF THE SITE. IT SHOWS THE SIDEWALK IN A POSITION THAT I THINK YOU ARE ASKING FOR. IT HAS A PATIO. IT HAS THE DUMPSTERS BUT THE DUMPSTERS THERE'S A WALL FOR THE BACK OF THE PATIO AND THEN THE DUMPERS ARE ON THE SOUTH SIDE. AND THERE'S A GATE. IT'S LIKE A W. I ASSUME IT'S A GATE OR FENCE AND THERE'S SOME OTHER NOTATIONS HERE. I'M NOT SURE IF I'M READING THIS RECKLY. I WANT -- CORRECTLY. I WANT -- YOU ARE URBAN PLANNERS AND ARCHITECTS.
03:22:33.577: >> Chair Mills: THE VERSION I'M READING FROM WHEN THIS WAS VOTED ON IN 2015 DOES SHOW THE DUMPSTERS IN THE SAME PLACE BUT I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT IMMEDIATELY NORTH OF THE DUMPSTERS, WHAT IS SHOWN IN THAT PUBLIC ART DISPLAY. CLEARLY -- RIGHT, TABLES ALONG STATE STREET. LIKE THIS IS WHERE WE GOT GOT LOTS OF THINKING ABOUT WHAT IS SHOWN. AND EVEN ON THE SITE PLAN IF THERE'S TABLES SHOWN THERE. IT SEEMS LIKE IT MAY NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT WE WILL GET TABLES IN THE PARTICULAR PLACE. SO I THINK -- SHEA. OKAY. BUT THE BASIC IDEA OF WHAT ELSE IS THERE, IT MAKES A WHOLE LOT OF SENSE. WE HAVE NOT MOVED THAT. THAT CONDITION YET. DOES ANYBODY WANT TO MAKE A MOTION TO MOVE IT? COMMISSIONER GIBB RANDALL. DISCUSSION OF THIS ADDITIONAL CONDITION? ALL IN FAVOR TO WORK WITH STAFF, PLEASE RAISE YOUR HAND OR SAY YES. ALL OPPOSED. SORRY COMMISSIONER CLARKE, I DIDN'T SEE A HAND OR HEAR ANYTHING. THAT'S WHY I -- YOU ARE A YES? OKAY. SOOU SHOULD MARS MARK US ALL DON AS YES. WE HAVE AN AMENDED PETITION. ONE IS ON THE SITE PLAN OVERALL, THE LANDSCAPING PART, AND THE OTHER IS FOR THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE. ANY MORE DISCUSSION? I THINK WE'LL TAKE THEM TOGETHER, IT SOUNDS LIKE IT MAKES SENSE. WE -- FOR THE FINAL VOTES WE DO A ROLL CALL VOTE. CAN YOU DO THAT?
03:24:33.397: >> Planning Manager: COMMISSIONER MILLS. CHAIR BUT WE CAN'T HEAR YOU.
03:24:40.103: >> Planning Manager: COMMISSIONER MILLS.
03:24:44.708: >> Chair Mills: S. WE'RE LIP RDING LITTLE BIT YES.missioner Gibbandall:
03:24:53.116: >> Commissioner Sauve:ES. YEommissioner Haerschmidt: Councilmb Disch: YES.
03:25:05.562: >> Commissior Clarke: YES.
03:25:07.097: >> YES.
03:25:07.364: >> Planning Manager:  IT CARRIES UNANIMOUSLY.
03:25:10.667: >> Chair Mills: VERY GOOD. OKAY. GOOD LUCK! ALL RIGHT. BACK TO THE AGENDA. OH, GOODNESS. ONE MORE ITEM OF NEW BUSINESS. WHICH IS ITEM 9C SOMEWHERE. I WILL FIND IT. THIS IS THE SITE PLAN REVIEW THRESHOLDS FOR CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL. THIS IS AN ORDINANCE AMENDMENT BECAUSE THIS WAS SOMETHING ON OUR WORK PLAN, ACTUALLY GIVEN TO US BY CITY COUNCIL, THAT WE GAVE -- THAT WE ASSIGNED TO THEMSELVES, WE WILL HAVE THE STAFF PRESENTATION AND THEN THE PUBLIC HEARING.
03:25:56.379: >> Planning Manager:  IF I COULD, I WILL START IT AND THEN QUICKLY TURN IT OVER TO MATT. ARE YOU ABLE TO HEAR ME NOW?
03:26:01.985: >> Chair Mills: YEP.
03:26:02.452: >> Planning Manager:  ALL RIGHT. SO I WANT TO FOR THE BENEFIT OF YOU AS COMMISSIONERS AND THE BENEFIT OF ORDINANCE REVISION COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND THE PUBLIC. THE VERSION THAT IS IN -- THAT WAS PUT IN YOUR PACKET LOOKS QUITE FROM THE VISION AT THE ORDINANCE REVISION COMMITTEE IS DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WAS ASKED TO BE PASSED ON TO THE COMMISSION. I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S CHANGE TO THE FUNCTIONALITY. IN SHORT, MATT WILL SUMMARIZE THIS, BUT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF CHANGES. ONE, THE PREVIOUS VERSION OF THE TABLE, WE WERE INTENDING AND WE WERE GOING THROUGH THE EXERCISE OF TRYING TO LIST EVERY POSSIBLE TYPE OF DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY IN THE CITY AND YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT'S DIFFICULT TO DO. INSTEAD OF THAT, WE HAVE TAKEN A DIFFERENT APPROACH WHERE WE SORT OF SHIFTED WHAT THE CURRENT FAME WORK OF SITE PLAN THRESHOLD ON ITS HEAD. RIGHT NOW THE U.D.C. SAYS THAT EVERY DEVELOPMENT, EVERY SINGLE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY, NO MATTER HOW BIG OR SMALL IN THE SI REQUIRES CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL. UNLESS THE ORDINANCE SPECIFICALLY EXEMPTS IT OR THE CITY COUNCIL DELEGATES THAT TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION OR THE PLANNING MANAGER. IT FLIPS THAT SCRIPT AND IT SAYS INSTEAD, THE ONLY ACTIVITY THAT REQUIRED SITE PLAN REVIEW AND APPROVAL OR THOSE THINGS LISTED IN THIS TABLE. EVERYTHING ELSE IS CAN BE DONE THROUGH A ZONING PERMIT. THIS SABL TABLE IS A LOT SHORTE. YOU ARE NOT SEEING US LIST ALL THE THINGS THAT DON'T REQUIRE SITE PLAN BECAUSE BY THE NATURE OF THAT RUCK OF THE SABLE AND THE -- HOW WE ARE SPECIFYING WHAT REQUIRES SITE PLAN APPROVAL, IT'S ALL OF THOSE ITEMS ARE INHERENTLY NOT REQUIRES SITE PLAN APPROVE BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT SPECIFICALLY SPELLED OUT IN THAT TABLE. SO THAT SAID, THIS IS WORK THAT THE CITY COUNCIL HAS DIRECTED. IF YOU HAVE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS, WE ARE HAPPY TO ADDRESS THEM. WE ARE TO COME BACK WITH MODIFICATIONS. WANT TO BE FAIR AND REALIC. IT LOOKS QUITE DIFFERENT. BUT I THINK IT DOES EFFECTIVELY RESPOND TO THE CITY COUNCIL DIRECTION. SO WITH THAT, I WILL TURN IT OVER TO MATT.
03:28:55.792: >> OKAY, GOOD EVENING, EVERYBODY. AND WELCOME TO COMMISSIONERS, NICE TO MEET YOU, COMMISSIONER WYCHE. WELCOME ABOARD. YOU PICKED A GOOD ET CETERA MOOING. LET ME ATTEMPT TO -- MEETING. LET ME ATTEMPT TO SHARE MY SCREEN. IT SAYS DISABLED PARTICIPANT SCREEN SHARING. GREAT. ALL RIGHT. THERE WE GO. OKAY. THIS SHOULD BE IT. OOPS. IS EVERYBODY SEEING MY SCREEN CORRECTLY? I THINK -- OKAY. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU ALL. SO IT'S A REALLY GOOD -- WE HAVE A LIST HERE. I WILL TOUCH ON BRIEFLY, THOSE HIGHLIGHTS THESE ARE TAKEN DIRECTLY FROM THE STAFF REPORT REALLY THE HIGHLIGHTS AND BRETT TOUCHED ON A COUPLE OF THESE. REALLY, I WILL READ THROUGH THESE REALLY QUICKLY. FIRST ONE AS YOU KNOW IS THAT THE CURRENT TEXT OF THE U.D.C., WE HAVE ALL THE SITE PLAN REQUIREMENTS WRITTEN OUT IN TEXT AND I'M SURE EVERYBODY HAS LOOKED AT THAT AT LEAST A COUPLE OF TIMES. SO REALLY IN RESPONSE TO THE COUNCIL DIRECTION AND MAKING THINGS EASILIER TO FOLLOW, AS WELL AS RESIDENTS AND EVEN STAFF SO WE CONVERTED THAT TO A TABLE. SO YOU WILL BE SEEING THAT SHORTLY. SO ADDITIONALLY, AND BRETT -- THE WAY THE ST TABLE IS CONSTRUCTED, WE HAVE ALL THE ELEMENTS THAT REQUIRE SITE PLAN REVIEW. WHETHER THAT WOULD BE EITHER FOR A P PLANNING MANAGER LEVEL APPROVAL OR CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL. THINGS NOT INCLUDED IN THAT CHART WOULD BE THROUGH BUILDING PERMITTED OR ZONING COMPLIANCE PERMITS. OOPS. THE LAST ONE IS -- ON THIS PAGE IS A SIGNIFICANT ONE. THIS IS AGAIN RESPONDING TO THE DIRECTION FROM THE CITY COUNCIL INITIATIVE WHICH WAS REALLY CHANGING THE LEVEL OF APPROVAL FROM CITY COUNCIL TO CITY PLANNING COMMISSION, FOR ANY PLANS THAT ARE NOT ASSOCIATED WITH THE REZONING. SO, AGAIN, THE TYPICAL KIND OF BY RIGHT FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD, THAT CORRESPONDS EXACTLY. NOT SOMETHING THAT REQUIRE -- WELL, SPECIAL EXCEPTION USES ALWAYS BE GRANTED BY YOU, BUT ANYTHING WITH THE REZONING, WE COULD HAVE THAT ON THE AGENDA TONIGHT, BUT WHETHER IT'S A PUD OR ANOTHER TYPICAL REZONING TO A C3 DISTRICT. IN I SITE PLAN THAT REQUIRES A REZONING WOULD BE REQUIRED TO GO TO CITY COUNCIL. CITY COUNCIL IS REQUIRED TO APPROVE ANY OF THOSE ZONING CHANGES. SO OKAY. BUILDING ADDITIONS. 300 SQUARE FEET OR LESS WOULD BE EXEMPT FROM SITE PLANNING REVIEW. THIS IS AN ITEM THAT'S FEEDBACK FROM PETITIONERS AND REFLECTIVE OF STAFF EXPERIENCE OVER THE PAST MANY YEARS OF SEEING WHERE THE TRUE VALUE ADD IS IN THIS PROCESS. SO ANYTHING OF A 300 SQUARE FEET OR LESS WOULD BE COMPLETELY EXCEPT FROM SITE PLAN. THAT DOES NOT MAKE THEM EXEMPT FROM BUILDING OR ZONING REVIEW. THEY HAVE TO COMPLY WITH ZONING REGULATIONS AND BUILDING CODE REGULATIONS. AGAIN, CURRENTLY THAT'S ONLY TRUE FOR SINGLE AND TWO-FAMILY. SO SINGLE FAMILY AND DUPLEXES. SO THIS WOULD ELEVATE UP TO FOUR UNITS THAT WOULD BE EXEMPT FROM SITE PLANNING. AGAIN -- AND ALL ZONING AND PLANNING REQUIREMENTS NEED TO COMPLY. WE LOOK AT RC4 LOTS. WOULD YOU STILL NEED 8500 SQUARE FEET IN ORDER TO CONSTRUCT ADDITIONAL UNITS. SO AGAIN, SO YOU DO HAVE TO STILL PROVIDE BUILDING AND PLANNING REQUIREMENTS. YOU CAN DO THAT. YOU CAN BUILD FOUR UNITS WITHOUT A SITE PLAN. FIVE OR SIX UNITS WOULD REQUIRE A SITE PLAN APPROVAL BY THE PLANNING MANAGER. THE REVIEW PROCESS IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS IT IS NOW, A STANDARD REVIEW THAT WOULD GO THROUGH ALL OF OUR DEPARTMENTS REVIEW COMPLIANCE WITH ALL SECTIONS OF THE U.C.D. REMOVAL OF PLANNING COMMISSION LEVEL -- PLANNING COMMISSION APPROVAL OF ADMINISTRATIVE LEVEL CHANGES WHEN THERE'S NO SITE PLAN ON FILE. SO CURRENTLY, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF ACTIONS IN THE TABLE WHERE IF YOU WANT TO DO SOMETHING RELATIVELY MINOR IF YOU HAVE A SITE PLAN ON FILE, YOU CAN ADMINISTRATIVELY AMEND IT OR GO TO PLANNING COMMISSION. IF YOU HAVE A SITE PLAN ON FILE. BUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE A SITE PLAN ON FILE, EVEN IF IT'S SOMETHING EXTREMELY MINOR, YOU HAVE TO -- THE CURRENT STRUCTURE IS TO GET A SITE PLAN APPROVED BY CITY COUNCIL IN ORDER TO DO THAT MINOR CHANGE BECAUSE YOU HAVE NO SITE PLAN ON FILE. WE REVISED IT, DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU HAVE A SITE PLAN ON FILE OR NOT. ARE COMPLYING TO ALL THE STANDARD REVIEW. IT DOESN'T TAKE AWAY THE PFAFF REVIEW OR THE PLANNING COMMISSION REVIEW AT THIS POINT. IT'S STILL -- BUT IT JUST REMOVES THAT REQUIREMENT FOR FOR THE PREVIOUSLY APPROVED PLAN. AND THE CONSTRUCTION OUTDOOR DECK, PATIO OR PLAZA.
03:33:54.190: >> Planning Manager:  MATT, I WANT TO INTERRUPT YOU. I WANT TO CLARIFY SOMETHING. I THINK YOU WERE YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN MISREFERENCING SOME OF THE APPROVAL LEVELS. RIGHT NOW THE CODE SAYS IN THAT TEXT, IT LISTS A BUNCH OF ADMINISTRATIVE LEVEL APPROVALS. WE ARE SAYING PLANNING MANAGER APPROVAL. THEN IT SAYS UNDER PLANNING COMMISSION APPROVAL, THOSE LISTED AS ADMINISTRATIVE APPROVAL WHEN THERE'S NOT APRILL A -- AN APPROVED SIT PLAN ON FILE, THOSE ARE PLANNING COMMISSION APPROVAL.
03:34:29.258: >> YES.
03:34:29.525: >> Planning Manager:  WHAT THIS WOULD DO WOULD ELIMINATE THAT AND IT WOULD SAY WHEN IT'S ONE OF THOSE CATEGORIES THAT A PLANNING MANAGER APPROVAL IS WARRANTED BASED ON THE SIZE OF PROJECT, REGARDLESS OF THE SITE PLAN APPROVAL. YOU DIDN'T SAY THAT.
03:34:54.283: >> THAT'S AN IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION. NICK ELSE, PLEASE CHIME (THANK YOU FOR THAT CLARIFICATION. THE OUTDOOR DECK AND DEVELOPMENTS WITH FOUR UNITS OR LESS. IT WOULD REQUIRE A SITE PLAN FOR PLANNING MANAGER APPROVAL FOR COMMERCIAL USES OR THINGS LIKE THAT. SO REALLY HERE IS -- I WON'T GO THROUGH THE TABLE LINE BY LINE, I DON'T THINK BECAUSE WE HAVE IT ON THE SCREEN AND IT'S IN THE PACKET AS WELL. THIS IS JUST LIKE A -- REALLY A SIGNIFICANT REARRANGEMENT IN HOW WE LOOKED AT OUR CODE AND IT IT WAS STRUCTURED AND WE THINK MUCH BETTER. IT IS A DIFFERENT FORMAT FROM WHAT THE O.R.C. ORIGINALLY SAW. THE INFORMATION IS STILL THERE, BUT IT IS A DIFFERENT MAT. WE TRIED TO MAKE IT A LITTLE MORE USER FRIENDLY WHERE THERE'S A CPLE OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO GET INFORMATION YOU WANT. YOU CAN START WITH THE USE ALONG THE TOP OR YOU CAN SAY BY, YOU KNOW, YOUR REQUIRED ACTIONS. WE TRIED TO GROUP THEM IN GROUPING THAT'S SEEM TO MAKE SENSE, SITE MODIFICATIONS AND OTHER SITE IMPROVEMENTS, NATURE FEATURES THINGS LIKE THAT, THAT YOU CAN REFERENCE ON THE LEFT OR GO, OKAY, YOUR YOU ARE PLANNING AN EIGHT UNIT BUILDING AND THIS IS WHAT YOU ARE PLANNING TO DO TO THAT EIGHT UNIT BUILDING AND THEN YOU KIND OF ADD 'EM UP AND SUE SEE WHAT LEVEL OF APPROVAL YOU NEED. SO REALLY, AGAIN, I WILL GO THROUGH A RELATIVELY BRIEFLY, OF HOW WE IS SEEN -- HOW WE HAVE THIS ORG  ORGANIZED. WE HAVE THE ABBREVIATIONS. I FOLLOWED THE LEGEND UP AT THE TOP. AND THE M.OR PLANNING MANAGER AND THE P. AND THE C. FOR CITY SO REALLY THAT'S THE CHA IN TAIL. I CAN READ THROUGH EVERY LINE BUT A WASN'T SUR THA W AN EFFECTIVE USE EVER TIME. CAN DEFINITELY GO BACKND REFEREE THAT AT ANY POINT. ANYTHING ELSTS TO TKBOUT YOU SEE IT HIGHLIGHTED IN RED HERE.
03:37:20.897: >> YES.
03:37:21.164: >> Planning Manager:  THIS IS SOMETHING FOR CONSIDERATION AND DISCUSSION. RIGHT NOW, WE HAVE DIFFERENT SITE REQUIREMENTS DEPENDING ON NUMBER OF DWELLING UNITS. PARKING COULD BE PART OF THAT OR WHICH LEVEL OF APPROVAL HAPPENS. AND TYPICALLY WHAT WE ALLOW AS WE WERE DISCUSSING A LITTLE BIT WITH THE LAST PROJECT. IS INTERIOR RENOVATIONS ARE PERMITTED BY BUILDING PERMIT. AS LONG AS YOU ARE NOT CHANGING THE FLOOR AREA, YOU ARE JUST PERMITTED TO DO THAT THROUGH NORMAL BUILDING PERMIT PROCESS. THIS WAS THROUGH SOME JUST DISCUSSION, A PROPOSAL TO SAY WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU RENOVATING WITHIN THE WALLS OF AN EXISTING APARTMENT BUILDING BUT YOU WERE INCREASING THE NUMBER OF DWELLING UNITS WITHIN THAT. DO WE WANT TO LOOK AT THAT DIFFERENTLY THAN OTHER INTERIOR RENOVATIONS WHERE YOU MAKE CHANGES. THAT'S SOMETHING NEW AND WE'RE HAPPY TO DISCUSS IT FURTHER BUT THAT IS PAY CHANGE IN EFFECT FROM THE REVISION COMMITTEE.
03:38:42.979: >> THAT'S THE ONLY ADDITION TO WHAT THE O.R.C. HAS PREVIOUSLY REVIEWED. FOR MOST PART, WE WERE BACK IN FRONT OF PLANNING COMMISSION IN APRIL OR MARCH. SOMETIME -- THE WHOLE COMMISSION PRESENTING WHERE WE'RE AT. IT REALLY HASN'T -- A LOT OF THE IDEAS WE HAD AT THAT TIME HAVEN'T CHANGED THAT MUCH. SORRY. THAT CONCLUDES THE PRESENTATION.
03:39:06.035: >> Chair Mills: ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE'LL OPEN UP THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PUBLIC HEARING. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PERSONS TO SPEAK FOR UP TO THREE MINUTES ABOUT THE PROPOSED SITE PLAN REVIEW THRESHOLD REQUIREMENTS TO THE U.D.C. IF YOU WISH TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION, PRESS STAR NINE BY PHONE OR RAISE YOUR HAND IF YOU JOINED BY THROUGH ZOOM. FOR PHONE ACCESS FOR THOSE OF YOU WATCHING THIS ANOTHER WAY, YOU CAN CALL 877-853-5247, AND ENTER MEETING I.D.97766341226. WHEN SPEAKING PLEASE MOVE TO A QUIET AREA AND MUTINY TELEVISION OR BACKANY TELEVISION BACKGROUND SOUNDS AND STATE YOUR NAME.
03:39:55.951: >> Planning Manager:  TERESA ANGELINI.
03:40:00.423: >> GOOD EVENING. THANK YOU. AND MY NAME IS TERESA ANGELINI, I LIVE ON BEECHWOOD DRIVE AND I'M AN ARCHITECT AND I'M VERY FAMILIAR WITH USING THE ORDINANCE AND WORKING THROUGH VARIOUS PROJECTS. AND THEN I'M PLEASED TO BE PART OF THIS ADVISORY COMMITTEE, THOUGH THE STUFF THAT WAS ISSUED ON FRIDAY WAS A LITTLE BIT OF SOMETHING THAT WE HADN'T SEEN BEFORE BUT I THINK IT'S A HUGE IMPROVEMENT, AND, YOU KNOW, THANKS TO STAFF THAT THEY REALLY LISTENED AND TAKEN A REALLY GOOD, HARD LOOK AT THE PROBLEMS INHERIT IN THE CURRENT ORDINANCE. THE WAY ANN ARBOR HAS MOVED TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING. CURRENTLY THERE'S A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH THE THRESHOLD AND I THINK THAT THIS WILL BE A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT. SO I'M REALLY IN SUPPORT OF THIS. AS I HAVE GONE THROUGH, JUST, YOU KNOW, SOME OF THE DETAILS BASINED OF THE DEVIL IN THE DETAILS HERE. I THINK SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WILL NEED TO BE ADDRESSES AFTER THIS, I HOPE THIS WILL BE APPROVED, BUT I THINK THERE'S STILL ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT WITH THIS WHOLE PROCESS ONCE IT GETS WITHIN THE CITY BECAUSE THERE ARE THINGS THAT ARE VERY CLEAR WITH REGARDS TO PARKING AND NATURAL FEATURES AND OTHER THINGS THAT ARE VERY OBTUSE AND THE WHOLE REVIEW -- THE PFAFF REVIEW THAT -- STAFF REVIEW THAT GOES THROUGH THE FIRE MARSHAL, ENGINEERING, SIDEWALKS, SOLID WASTE, TRAFFIC, CAN TIMES BE IN CONFLICT WITH EACH OTHER AND THERE'S NO REFEREE, AND FOR THE SMALL PROJECTS IT GETS VERY EXPENSIVE AND SEEMINGLY UNNECESSARY AND A LOT OF PROBLEMS THAT ARE INHERENT IN THAT PROCESS. FOR SMALLER PROJECTS, THIS A BIG IMPROVEMENT, ESPECIALLY FOR THE UNDER 300 SQUARE FEET ONES. I'M FLIPPING TO THE TABLE. THIS ONE SMALL DETAILTAIL, HAVIO DO WITH THE ADDITIONS GREATER THAN 300 SQUARE FEET BUT LESS THAN 10% OF THE EXISTING SQUARE FOOTAGE AREA. THAT COULD BE DIFFICULT WHEN THERE'S MULTIPLE BUILDINGS. STAFF HAS THEIR INTERPRETATION ON, IT BUT IT'S NOT REALLY CLEAR TO OTHERS WHO ARE NOT SO FAMILIAR WITH READING THROUGH IT. OR ENFORCING IT. SO I THINK I'M IN SUPPORT AND I WILL YIELD MY TIME AND  I APPRECIATE THE IMPROVEMENTS THAT ARE POSSIBLE HERE. THANK YOU.
03:43:00.803: >> Chair Mills: THANK YOU.
03:43:04.139: >> Planning Manager:  CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING WITH 955. YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
03:43:15.150: >> HELLO, KURT WESTPHAL, THIS IS A F FANTASTIC PROJECT AND I APPRECIATE ALL THE HARD WORK THAT HAS GONE INTO THE DETAIL AND LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS MOVING THROUGH. THERE WAS ONE SMALL THING THAT I HAD TROUBLE UNDERSTANDING IN THE CHART, IN TABLE 5.29-1 UNDER NEW CONSTRUCTION I WAS A LITTLE CONFUSED ABOUT THE LEVEL OF SITE PLAN REVIEW FOR CONSTRUCTION OF MIXED USE BUILDINGS. IN CONSTRUCTION OF MIXED USE BUILDINGS THAT CONTAINED DWELLING UNITS. IT LOOKS LIKE IT SAYS SITE PLAN NOT REQUIRED. SO I WAS JUST CONFUSED ABOUT SOME OF THE NOTATIONS IN CHART AS WELL AS SAY A -- A RESIDENTIAL BUILDING IN A -- LIKE A DOWNTOWN DISTRICT THAT MIGHT BE I DON'T KNOW, YOU KNOW, S.R.O. TYPE BUILDING OR GROUP HOUSING. IT LOOKS LIKE IT DOESN'T REQUIRE SITE PLAN REVIEW. SO I WAS JUST A LITTLE -- I WAS JUST CONCERNED -- CONFUSED ABOUT THE CHART A LITTLE BIT THERE AND THE OTHER -- THE OTHER ITEM IS THAT I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE AND PROPER TO DELICATE A LOT OF PROJECTS TO ADMINISTRATOR REVIEW, AND I GUESS IT JUST ADDS A -- IT MAY BE REPFUL JUST TO SEE A LIFT OF THOSE THINGS AND WHAT TYPE OF PROJECTS GOT REVIEWED AND APPROVED ADMINISTRATIVELY, YOU KNOW, QUARTERLY OR MONTHLY OR WHATEVER, OR AS THEY HAPPENED JUST SO THE COMMISSION CAN LOOK AT TRENDS AND WHAT IS BEING REQUESTED AND WHAT IS BEING APPROVED. SO THANKS AGAIN FOR ALL THE HARD WORK AND APPRECIATE IT.
03:45:31.787: >> Chair Mills: THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE? PLEASE USE THE RAISE HAND FEATURE ON ZOOM. ALL RIGHT. LET ME READ THE MOTION. WHICH IS THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION, APPROVE AMENDMENTS TO CHAPTER 55 UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE TO AMEND SECTIONS 5.29.6 RELATED TO SITE PLAN REVIEW AND APPROVAL STANDARDS. MOVED BY COMMISSIONER SAUVE AND SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER WYCHE? DISCUSSION OF THESE. COMMISSIONER SAUVE AND THEN COMMISSIONER DISCH.
03:46:21.336: >> Commissioner Sauve: THANK YOU FOR ALL OF THIS. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT RES DEPENDINGIAL. I WAS FIRST CONFUSED AND I SEE HOW THE TWO THINGS, THE IN THE YOU CONSTRUCTION FLIPPED. THESE ARE FOR PLANNING COMMISSION AND ONE IS NOT APPLICABLE. I GUESS I'M ASKING THE LOGIC OF REQUIRING I SUPPORT THIS WHEN I SEE IT. REQUIRING PLANNING COMMISSION APPROVAL FOR 1 TO 4 DWELLING UNITS IN MIXED USE OR SPECIAL PURPOSE. MY UNDERSTANDING RIGHT NOW IS IT'S BY RIGHT IN ALMOST ANYWHERE OR JUST NON-CONFORMING SITES ARE ALWAYS BY RIGHT SINGLE FAMILY, RIGHT? WELL, SINGLE FAMILY IF YOU CONDUCT A SINGLE FAMILY HOUSE IN THE NONRESIDENTIAL, IT TRIGGERS SITE PLAN BECAUSE THE SEUSSS COULD BE INTERCHANGED IF IT'S IN A NONRESIDENTIAL DISTRICT, YOU CAN USE IT AS A COMMERCIAL BUILDING. THAT'S WHY THAT DISTINCT IS IN THERE. EVEN NOW, AGAIN, A SINGLE FAMILY OR TWO FAMILY WOULD TRIGGER A SITE PLAN IF YOU ARE NOT IN A RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT.
03:47:44.753: >> Commissioner Sauve: GOT IT. OR SEEING SOMETHING IN THE VERY FUTURE MEETING LIKE ENCLOSING A DECK IN A NONRESIDENTIAL FOR SOMETHING THAT WAS APPROVED AS A RESIDENTIAL PLACE.
03:48:00.636: >> YES.
03:48:01.036: >> Commissioner Sauve: COOL. I GUESS THE DEFAULT OF A NON-CONFMING RESIDENTIAL MEANS SINGLE FAMILY IS THE DEFAULT WHICH GOES INTO THE FIRST ROW OF CONSTRUCTION RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS ARE NOT APPLICABLE. THAT'S HOW WE SEE IT NOW. OKAY. THAT'S GOOD AND I WANT TO TALK THROUGH THIS INTERIOR CONSTRUCTION THAT RESULTS IN A HIGHER NUMBER OF DWELLING UNITS AND WHEN AND HOW WE WOULD SEE IT. I THINK IT WAS AN R4C THAT A UNIQUE SCENARIO THAT TWO KITCHENS IN ONE UNIT WITH TWO STAIRS THAT WENT UP TO BEDROOMS THAT FELT VERY COMFORTABLE TO JUST PUT A WALL IN IN THE FUTURE BUT IT LOOKED LIKE A LOOPHOLE TO PUT PARKING IT AND THEN MAYBE THE CODE WOULD CATCH UP. SO THAT, YOU KNOW, PA,ING ON UNITS VERSUS DWELLING MIGHT DO SOMETHING. THAT'S HOW WE INTERPRETED A POSSIBLE FUTURE OF IT. I GUESS THAT'S ONE SCENARIO. I SEE THIS HIGHLIGED THING PLAYING OUT ISHAT INTERIOR RCUMSTANCE, IT WAS ALREADY XED OUT. SO IT WOULD NOT MEETONING
03:49:24.653: >> Pnninganer:  AM GIVE AN EXAMPLE. AND PART OF THIS HAS TO DO WITH A U.C.D. CHANGE WE MADE. SO THE FORMER ZONING CHAPTER. CHAPTER ONE OF THE SIGNATURE CHANGES WE ACTUALLY CLARIFIED HOW WE DEFINE FLOOR AREA. PREVIOUSLY OF YOU MAY RECALL THAT THE FLOOR DEFINITION IS SPACE THAT IS OR COULD BE MADE HABITABLE. AND THAT WAS OFTEN A DIFFICULT TO MEASURE, INTERPRET, AND AS A RESULT OF THAT, WE CHANGED THE U.D.C. TO A MUCH MORE I THINK SIMPLE DEFINITION WHICH SAYS THE FLOOR AREA IS THE SPACE BETWEEN THE EXTERIOR WALLS. IT'S THE FLOOR AREA OF THE BUILDING. WHAT THAT NATURALLY MEANS, THOUGH, THERE COULD BE A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE YOU HAD A THREE-UNIT HOUSE AND THOSE THREE UNITS WERE ON THE FIRST AND SECOND UNIT AND THE BASEMENT MAY NOT HAVE MET THE DEFINITION OF HABITABLE -- TO BE MADE HABITABLE BUT NOW IT'S ACTUALLY FLOOR AREA. AND YOU MIGHT DECIDE THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO MAKE THE PHYSICAL ALTERATIONS TO THAT BASEMENT WHERE YOU COULD ACTUALLY PUT A UNIT THERE. THAT'S A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE YOU WOULD BE DOING INTERIOR ONLY RENOVATIONS TO A BUILDING. IT WOULDN'T BE ADDING FLOOR AREA UNDER THE U.D.C. HOWEVER, YOU MIGHT BE GOING FROM 3 TO FOUR UNITS OR YOU COULD BE GOING FROM 4 TO 5 UNITS WHICH WOULD BE A DIFFICULT LEVEL OF AUTHORITY IN THIS TABLE. AND SO THAT'S WHY -- THAT WAS THE -- THAT WAS THE SCENARIO THAT PROMPTED THE SUGGESTION OF THIS LANGUAGE.
03:51:24.473: >> Commissioner Sauve: GOT IT. OKAY. THAT'S HELPFUL. I THINK THE OTHER THING, WE HAVE GONE BACK AND FORTH ABOUT THE 5 TO 6 UNITS. IT'S SPLIT UP FOR PUBLIC COMMENT THING. I WILL RAISE IT FOR CONVERSATION THAT, YOU KNOW, 5 TO 6 DWELLING UNIT IN A RESIDENTIAL WOULD NOT MAKE IT TO PUBLIC COMMENT AS IT'S WRITTEN RIGHT NOW, BUT IT WOULD IN MIXED USE AND SPECIAL PURPOSE. SO IT ALMOST FEELS -- THIS IS HOW WE SAW IT BEFORE, RIGHT? IT WASN'T BROKEN UP BY ZONING DISTRICT. WE WERE JUST LOOKING AT DWELLING UNIT COUNT IN THE PREVIOUS VERSION; IS THAT CORRECT? I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE IT WAS SPLIT. WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT ONE LINE ITEM AT 5 TO 6 GOING TO PLANNING COMMISSION TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE PUBLIC COMMENT.
03:52:22.230: >> Planning Manager:  YES, I GUESS I WOULD HAVE TO MATT. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU RECALL THAT. YES, I REMEMBER WE WERE TALKING ABOUT WHETHER IT WAS GOING TO BE SIX UNITS WOULD BE EXEMPT AND IF NOT, WHAT THE LEVEL WAS. MY RECOLLECTION WAS WHERE WE LANDED WAS THIS FRAMEWORK HERE, THAT ORIGINALLY -- I THINK WE ORIGINALLY EXPLORED SIX UNITS WOULD BE EXEMPT, AND I THINK FOR SIMILAR REASONS THEY THOUGHT THAT WAS TOO FAR AFIELD. BECAUSE IT COULD BE OF A SIGNIFICANT SIZE OR IMPACTFUL. AND SO THIS MAKE HAVE BEEN A -- FRANKLY A NOTATION WE TOOK OUT OF THAT FINAL MEETING AND WE CAN'T GET IT ACCURATELY. SO WE'RE HAPPY -- I'M HAPPY TO LOOK AT MODIFICATION OF THAT.
03:53:15.750: >> I WOULD ECHO BRETT'S COMMENTS. I REMEMBER IT THROUGH THE NOTES. WE HAD IT LUMPED 1 TO 6 AND I THINK THE 5 TO 6 WE WANTED TO TAKE OUT FOR THE PLANNING MANAGER. THAT'S WHY WE ARE HERE TONIGHT. THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE A MUST BE LIPUBLICHEARING WITH THE PLANNIG MANAGER HEARING.
03:53:41.009: >> Commissioner Sauve: THE MIXED USE, WOULD REQUIRE A PUBLIC HEARING. YOU COULD DO A SIX PLEX ONLY THROUGH THE PLANNING MANAGER.
03:53:52.787: >> YEAH.
03:53:53.054: >> Planning Manager:  AND FOR THAT. -- FOR THAT RESIDENTIAL THAT CAN ONLY BE RESIDENTIAL USE. IN THE SPECIAL SURPRISE OR MIXED USE DISTRICTS THAT COULD START OFF AS RESIDENTIAL AND MORPH INTO OFFICE AND MORPH INTO SOME OTHER USE.
03:54:08.069: >> Commissioner Sauve: RIGHT. AND IN BOTH OF THOSE CASES A FULL SITE PLAN IS REQUIRED TO BE DRAWN AND REVIEWED IN ALL OF THESE. AND I GUESS THAT'S JUST TO CONFIRM, LIKE, IT'S NOT APPLICABLE JUST BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS GETTING AT REALLY HELPING SMALLER PROJECTS AND NOVICE KIND OF DEVELOPERS UNDERSTAND, YOU KNOW, WHAT IS -- LIKE, WHAT IS EXPECTED OF YOU. I KNOW IT DOES SAY IF YOU CAN GET AT PERMIT LEVEL. I'M NOT SURE IF THERE'S FURTHER CLARIFICATION THAT YOU NEED TO MEET THE STANDARDS EVEN IF A SITE PLAN IS NOT REQUIRED, HOW TO LIKE REARTICULATE ONE MORE TIME, MAYBE IN THE TABLE. I THINK IT SAYS IT LIKE IN THE FIRST PARAGRAPH. SORRY. INCLUDED WITHOUT -- THE APPLICABLE CITY PERMITS ABOUT THE NECESSITY OF A CITY TIGHT SE PLAN JUST FOR LEDGABILITY, YOU DON'T WANT TO REPEAT WORDS EVERYWHERE. I DON'T KNOW. IT'S JUST SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT. I'M HAPPY AS IT IS BUT AN ASTERISK THAT SAYS STILL NEEDS TO MEET SIGH SITE PLAN REQUIREM.
03:55:33.021: >> Planning Manager:  I AGREE WITH THE TENSION YOU ARE HAVING. THAT'S HOW WE EVOLVED. ULTIMATELY WE SAID LET'S HAVE IT A SITE PLAN TABLE. YOU NEED A ZONING PERMIT FOR EVERYTHING AND HERE WE'RE SAYING -- WE ARE REPEATING THAT. YOU NEED A PERMIT FOR EVERYTHING, UNLESS IT'S A MISTABLE AND THEN YOU NEED SITE PLAN. AND I TOTALLY APPRECIATE THAT TENSION. THAT'S WHERE I STARTED AND THAT'S WHERE WE WERE PRESENTING WITH THE O.R.C. WASN'T THERE ONE TABLE WHERE ALL OF THAT GETS ANSWERED? I THINK AT THE END OF THE DAY IT WAS MESSIER AND BIGGER AND I HOPE THIS IS A BETTER WAY.
03:56:12.127: >> Commissioner Sauve: I THINK IT SAYS N.A. SITE PLAN NOT REQUIRED.
03:56:18.500: >> Planning Manager:  WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
03:56:20.535: >> Commissioner Sauve: STANDARDS TILL NEED TO BE MET TO FINISH THAT SENTENCE NOT THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO MEET STANDARDS IS HOW IT'S INTERPRETED. THOSE ARE MINE. I REALLY, REALLY APPRECIATE ALL OF THIS WORK TO THIS POINT. THANK YOU.
03:56:48.697: >> Chair Mills: COMMISSIONER DISCH.
03:56:49.698: >> Councilmember Disch: I ACTUALLY JUST WANTED TO SAY HOW WELCOME THESE CHANGES ARE. AND AND IT IS WONDERFUL THAT EVERYONE IS MOVING INTO WHAT THE PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATION OF PLANNERS RECOGNIZES AS A BEST PRACTICE WHICH IS NOT TO SEND TO COUNCIL BY RIGHT SITE PERHAPS PS WHICH COUNCIL CANNOT TURN DOWN. SO THAT IS WONDERFUL. AND REMOVING THE BARRIERS TO THINGS THAT DON'T NEED AS STRINGENT REVIEW AS WE HAVE THEM. I ALSO WANTED TO SAY THAT FOR THE MOST PART, I THINK THAT THIS -- I MEAN, WE ARE FINDING FINEY LITTLE BITS AROUND THE EDGES WHERE IT COULD BE MORE CLEAR. I KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO PRESENT INFORMATION TO PEOPLE IN A WAY THAT IS PEDAGOGICAL, THAT ENABLES THEM TO LEARN IT AND SO THE MINUTE THAT YOU REALIZE, LET'S MAKE THIS A SITE PLAN TABLE, WHAT A GREAT INSPIRATION AND THIS IS SO TIDY AND SO NEAT AND IT DOES SUCH AN AMAZING JOB RATHER THAN ALL OF THOSE -- YOU KNOW THAT SEA OF RED TT THAT YOU HAVE CROSSED OUT THIS TABLE IS SO ORGANIZED AND AMAZING. I'M JUST -- I'M REALLY IMPRESSED AND REALLY HAPPY SO THANK YOU. AND A WAS GO I WAS GOING TO ASKA QUESTION ABOUT THE DWELLING UNITS BUT COMMISSIONER SAUVE ALREADY DID THAT. SO THAT WAS THAT.
03:58:31.666: >> Chair Mills: COMMISSIONER WYCHE.
03:58:33.668: >> JUST A REQUEST I CAN QUESTION -- WHAT I HOPE IS A QUICK QUESTION SINCE I'M NEW TO ALL OF THESE CHANGES, JOHNNY COME LATELY HERE. AS I READ THE TABLE AND THE FIRST LINE UNDER ACTIVITY OF ACCOMPANYING LEGISLATIVE ACTION, ANY SITE PLAN, AREA PLAN, OR CONCEPT PLAN ACCOMPANYING A REZONING PETITION. THOSE GO TO COUNCIL. DO THEY BYPASS PLANNING COMMISSION? AND DO THEY BYPASS STAFF REVIEW? OKAY. SO JUST IN MY -- LIKE MY FIRST READING, JUST COMING TO THE TABLE, IT APPEARS TO ME THAT IT GOES DIRECTLY TO COUNCIL. I'M SURE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE USED TO READING THE CODE KNOW THAT THERE'S A SERIES OF STEPS F. THIS' ANY LITTLE ASTERISK THAT WE'LL SAY THESE -- YOU KNOW, ITEMS THAT GO TO COUNCIL HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS, IT JUST IMPROVES THE READABILITY FOR, SAY, A HOMEOWNER LIKE I, WHO MIGHT WANT TO TURN MY SINGLE FAMILY DWELLING INTO A QUAD PLEX, BUT I AM IN ZONE -- SINGLE FAMILY AND SO I APPARENTLY WILL NEED TO REQUEST A REZONING IN ORDER TO MAKE MY SINGMENT FAMILY DWELLING A QUAD PLEX. BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN I'M GOING TO GO STRAIGHT TO COUNCIL IT MEANS I HAVE TO GO THROUGH A STAFF REVIEW. I HAVE TO COME TO PLANNING COMMISSION. MY NEIGHBORS MAY COME TO PLANNING COMMISSION AND IMPOSE AT THE PUBLIC HEARING, ME CONVERTING MY HOUSE IN THAT WAY, AND THEN IT GOES TOOUNCIL PENDING APPROVAL. SO IF THERE'S SOME WAY FOR ME WOULD WANTS TO CONVERT MY HOUSING IN THAT WAY TO READ THAT MORE CLEARLY, THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. THANK YOU.
04:00:24.312: >> Chair Mills: YOU MOVED AND MY MUTE BUTTON MOVED. COMMISCOMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMID.
04:00:30.151: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: I THINK IS MORE CLEAR THAN THE LEVEL ONE, LEVEL TWO, LEVEL THREE STUFF FROM PREVIOUS ITERATIONS BUT MAYBE ON THIS TABLE, WE COULD SAY APPROVED BY PLANNING MANAGER AND PLANNING COMMISSION. PLANNING MANAGER -- I'M SURE WE CAN WORK IT OUT. I THINK THIS IS LOOKS REALLY GREAT. I THINK THIS IS A LOT -- THIS IS VERY CLEAR. I'M WONDER D.C. THERE'S LIKE THE N. A.s UNDER NEW CONSTRUCTION BECAUSE LITERALLY THOSE THINGS DO NOT APPLY, RIGHT? YOU CANNOT CONSTRUCT -- CONSTRUCTION OF A RESIDENTIAL BUILDING AND, LIKE THE ALL OTHER USES THING, LIKE THAT'S LITERALLY NOT ALICABLE BUT ALL THE OTHER N.A.s MEANSOU CAN DO THAT IT. JUST DOESN'T REQUIRE A SITE PLAN. SO I WONDER IF THERE'S A WAY TO, LIKE, BLOCK IT -- LIKE BLACK IT OUT, LIKE THE ONES -- IT MIGHT ONLY BE THOSE TWO UNDER THE NEW CONSTRUCTION AT THE VERY END, BUT I WONDER IF THERE'S A WAY TO DIINGUISH --.A. MEANS YOU DON'T -- IT'S NOT APPLICABLE? THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THIS IS A LOT OF WORK.
04:01:49.030: >> Chair Mills: I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON THE QUESTION OF THE 300 SQUARE FOOT ADDITION AND IF YOU HAVE MULTIPLE BUILDINGS ON YOUR SITE, WHERE THAT LANGUAGE IS. BECAUSE I KNOW WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS, BUT.
04:02:05.013: >> Planning Manager:  I APPRECIATE IT. AND MS. ANGELINI HAS BEEN A PROPONENT AND SHE SHARED THAT PERSPECTIVE WITH OTHERS. WHERE THAT INTERPRETATION COMES FROM, I DON'T PROFESS THAT IT'S PERFECT BUT IT'S IN THE DEFINITION OF FLOOR AREA. WE DESIGN FLOOR AREA AS I WAS MENTIONING BEFORE, AS THE AREA BETWEEN THE EXTERIOR WALLS OF A BUILDING. THAT -- THAT HAS AN IMPACT, NOW HE, 300 -- A PERCENTAGE OF A BILLING LESS FLOOR AREA THAN IF THAT SAME PERCENTAGE WAS APPLIED TO THE FLOOR AREA CUMULATIVE AREA OF ALL BUILDINGS ON A SITE.
04:02:51.092: >> I THINK WE TALKED ABOUT AT THE ORDINANCE -- WE TALK ABOUT WHAT IS THE PROPER LEVEL OF REVIEW IS FOR THAT. SO I THINK I -- I APPRECIATE THE CRITIQUE. I THINK THERE'S -- WELL, I THINK THERE'S TWO CRITIQUES THAT ARE FAIR. ONE IS THAT THE RIGHT WAY TO MEASURE IT? SHOULD IT BE BY BUILDING OR SHOULD IT BE BY SITE AND TWO, HAVING TO INTERPRET THAT THROUGH DEFINITIONS DOES TAKE A LITTLE TIME AND AS INDICATED, SOMEBODY MIGHT READ IT DIFFERENTLY THAN THE WAY STAFF DOES. THAT DOESN'T CHANGE THE APPROACH. WE ARE CHANGING THAT 300 SQUARE FEET AS A NEW APPROACH. BUT WE ARE NOT PROPOSING THE CHANGE THAT WOULD CHANGE THAT MEASUREMENT FROM A BUILDING PERCENTAGE MEASUREMENT TO A SITE PERCENTAGE MEASUREMENT.
04:03:51.285: >> Chair Mills: THANKS FOR THE ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION THERE. I WENT THROUGH AND DID SOME COMPARESON OF WHAT WE DISCUSSED AT THE LAST O.R.C. AND MAYBE WE DECIDED TO MAKE A CHANGE. THIS WAS KIND OF IN THE SAME VAPE AS WHAT COMMISSIONER SAUVE SAID ABOUT THE FIVE AND SIX FAMILY UNITS AND WHETHER THERE SHOULD BE PUBLIC HEARINGS ASSOCIATED WITH THEM. BUT THE THINGS THAT I CAUGHT THAT ARE DIFFERENT ARE OUTDOOR PATIO OR PLAZAS UP TO 1,000 SQUARE FEET, AT LEAST ON THE TABLE THAT WE HAD LAST TIME AROUND. WE SAID THAT THEY WOULD BE EXEMPT. AND HERE THIS WOULD BE SOME THAT ARE NOT. AND I DON'T REMEMBER DISCUSSING LIKE THAT THAT WAS A BAD IDEA. I MEAN, THAT'S JUST ONE THAT STANDS OUT TO ME AS I'M NOT SURE, THAT SEEMS PRETTY SMALL.
04:04:45.807: >> Planning Manager:  MATT, HELP ME OUT IF THAT'S WRONG. I THINK THAT IS FAIR THAT THAT IS A DISTINCTION. WE HAVE HAD A COUPLE OF PROJECTS COME UP TO -- ONE THE THINGS YOU WILL -- YOU MAY RECALL, I THINK THAT GENERALLY OUR ACCESSORY BUILDINGS AND ACCESSORY STRUCTURES, IT APARTMENTS A LOT OF WORK AND -- WARRANTS A LOST WORK AND A LOT OF -- A LOT OF WORK AND A LOT OF MODIFICATION. I THINK PREVIOUSLY WE WERE -- I DON'T KNOW THAT WE HAD -- WELL, I THOUGHT THAT WE WERE ALWAYS DISTINGUISHING THEM, BUT WE -- THE LEVEL MIGHT HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED, SO I'M HAPPY, I GUESS IN SHORT --
04:05:25.746: >> YOU HAVE TO REVISIT --
04:05:28.049: >> Planning Manager:  THE STRUCKURE IS RIGHT. I WOULD BE GRATEFUL TO THINK WHAT THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL IS. GENERALLY AS THOSE GET LARGER, THEY WARRANT MORE CONSIDERATION. THEY WILL HAVE MORE IMPACT FOR STORMWATER. THEY WILL MIGHT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO HAVE MORE IMPACT TO NATURAL FEATURES. BUT MY APOLOGIES IF WE GOT IT OFF. BUT I'M HAPPY TO DISCUSS WHAT YOU THINK THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL MIGHT BE.
04:05:56.777: >> Chair Mills: WELL, I THINK WHAT IT IS RIGHT NOW AT LEAST ACCORDING TO THE TABLE FROM THE LAST TIME THAT THE CURRENT --
04:06:03.517: >> Planning Manager:  UNDER 1,000.
04:06:09.590: >> Chair Mills: THE PROPOSAL WOULD BE EXEMPT. IT'S CURRENTLY TWO AND THREE BASED ON WHAT IT IS RIGHT NOW. SO THE PROPOSAL WAS EXEMPT, I THOUGHT SURE, THAT MAKES SENSE. LET'S MAKE THOSE ALL EXEMPT.
04:06:30.878: >> WAS THAT UP TO 1,000 SQUARE FEET?
04:06:34.749: >> Chair Mills: UP TO 1,000.
04:06:36.717: >> YEAH.
04:06:36.984: >> Chair Mills: AND THE ONES BIGGER THAN THAT, YEAH, WE'RE NOT TO BE EXEMPT. SOME OF THESE ARE CLERICAL THINGS WHEN YOU TRANSLATE ONE TO ANOTHER, I WOULD IMAGINE FOR M.s AND P.s TO GET MIXED UP.
04:07:05.146: >> WE COULD MODIFY THAT SO THAT UP TO 1,000 SQUARE FEET IS EXEMPT. IF THAT IS THE CASE, I THINK WE SHOULD LOOK AT THE ADDITIONS. IT'S DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A 300 SQUARE FEET PATIO OR GARAGE SHED OR YOU NAME IT. YEAH. I'M --
04:07:35.042: >> I THINK PART OF IT -- I THINK THAT WAS PART OF THE DISCUSSION AS IT'S BRINGING BACK, WHEN WE FOLLOWED UP FROM THE O.R.C. IS THAT WE THAT DISCREPANCY WHERE WE WERE ALLOWING A 300 SQUARE FOOT, YOU KNOW, AT DECISION BUT LIKE I SAY A 600 SQUARE EDITION WOULD TRIGGER THE SITE PLAN BUT A 600 SQUARE FOOT PATIO WOULDN'T. WE HAD TO MAKE THAT DECISION OF HOW BIG IS TOO BIG? WE ARE INTERESTED IN THE COMMISSION'S -- DEFINITELY THE VIEWS ON THAT TONIGHT IF WE INTERPRETED THAT INCORRECTLY.
04:08:15.149: >> Chair Mills: COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL.
04:08:16.083: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: WHEN YOU SAY EXEMPT, WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT COMMISSIONER MILLS? IT DOESN'T MEET ANY STANDARDS AT ALL? THE PATIO IS STILL -- IT'S STORM MATTER AND ALL THAT KIND OF --
04:08:26.794: >> OKAY.
04:08:28.062: >> Chair Mills: I WOULD SAY LIKE MY INTERPRETATION IT'S THE ZONING. LIKE YOU STILL HAVE TO GET ZONING APPROVAL BUT, LIKE, IT MEANS THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH ALL THE NATURAL FEATURES AND ALSO BRING THE WHOLE SITES BECAUSE THAT'S THE OTHER PART THAT, REMEMBER, IF YOU ARE SHOWN ON THIS AS REQUIRING ANYTHING OTHER THAN N.A. -- AND I'M JUST SAYING TO MAKE SURE I HAVE MR. LENART NODDING, IT'S THE ENTIRE SITE. NOT JUST THAT THING, RIGHT? WE DID NOT -- ONE THE THINGS WE DECIDED NOT TO BITE OFF RIGHT NOW IS SITE PLAN LIGHT OR ONLY DOING PART OF IT OR ONLY DOING PART OF THE SITE.
04:09:05.666: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: SO IF I WANTED TO BUILD A PATIO AT MY RESTAURANT THAT WAS 999 SQUARE FEET, I WOULD STILL NEED TO GET APPROVAL THROUGH STAFF IN TERMS OF MANAGING WATER FOR THAT AND ALL OF THAT KIND OF THING?
04:09:20.981: >> YOU WOULD STILL HAVE TO PULL A BUILDING PERMIT AND A GRATING PERMIT.
04:09:25.486: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: BUT DO I NEED TO DO STORMWATER FOR THAT?
04:09:28.522: >> YES, UNDER THIS, A 999 SQUARE FEET, AND THE MIXED USE NON-PROSE DENTIAL USE WOULD REQUIRE YOU TO SUBMIT A SITE PLAN, SHOWING THAT OPEN THERE, WE WILL LOOK AT THE WHOLE SITE BUT IT WILL BE FOR PLANNING MANAGER APPROVAL.
04:09:43.771: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: BUT IT'S FOR THE WHOLE SITE, NOT JUST FOR THE --
04:09:47.775: >> Chair Mills: AND TO BE CLEAR, AT LEAST THE WAY I READ THIS, IF YOU ARE A RESTAURANT AND YOU WANT TO PUT A 9 SQUARE FOOT DECK OR PATIO ON HERE, IT'S UNDER 1,000 SQUARE FEET. IT FALLS UNDER THAT. LIKE, THERE'S NO MINIMUM.
04:10:07.094: >> Planning Manager:  I THINK IT'S UNDER THE LINE. IT'S UNDER 300 SQUARE FEET SO -- SO IF IT'S UNDER 300 SQUARE FEET, THEN IT WILL BE A BUILDING PER MITT BECAUSE IT'S NOT LISTED IN THE TABLE. ARE ACOR.
04:10:26.046: >> Chair Mills: BUT IF IT'S -- I THINK THAT WE MIGHT NEED TO ADD RANGES BECAUSE I COMPLETELY MISSED THAT AND I WOULD NOT BE THE ONLY PERSON. SO IF EVERYTHING UNDER 300 SQUARE FEET IS EXEMPT, COOL. THAT'S NOT HOW I READ THAT, THOUGH. AND SO I THINK THAT 300 TO 1,000 SQUARE FEET NEEDS TO BE ON THAT.
04:10:51.472: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: AND, AGAIN, YOU ARE DEFINING EXEMPT --
04:10:57.111: >> Planning Manager: PERMITTED, NOT SITE PLAN.
04:11:02.416: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: BUT UNDER 300 SQUARE FEET, YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING SPECIAL FOR IT?
04:11:11.158: >> Planning Manager:  IT'S NOT AN APPROVAL. IT DEFAULTS TO ZONING PERMIT, BUILDING MER MITT. WE ARE NOT EXEMPTING ANYTHING FROM THE BUILDING CODE, ZONING REGULATIONS. WHEN IT'S N.A. HERE, IT MEANS THAT'S DON'T THROUGH THE PERMITTING PROCESS. IT'S NOT DONE TO RAISE SITE PLANS.
04:11:32.346: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: GOT IT.
04:11:34.248: >> Chair Mills: SO COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL, THAT'S YOUR QUESTION AND TO MAKE SURE THE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND, IF IT'S 301 SQUARE FEET, THEN YOU WOULD HAVE TO BRING -- YOU HAVE TO DO TO. WATER, AND EVERYTHING FOR THE WHOLE FOLKS FOR THE OUTDOOR PATIO.
04:11:57.938: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: THAT'S ENOUGH TO HAVE ONE TABLE AND CHAIRS AND TO SERVE. I'M JUST PUTTING IT OUT THERE.
04:12:08.816: >> Chair Mills: WHICH IS WHY I WOULD OPT TO STRIKE THAT. AND MAKE THEM ALL N.A. ALL THE WAY ACRS THERE.
04:12:24.031: >> Planning Manager: EVERYTHING UP TO 1,000 SQUARE FEET IS N.A. OR UNDER 3 AWN THOUSAND SQUARE FEET. AGAIN, IT COULD BE DIFFERENT BUT, LIKE, THE DECK, THE PATIO, LIKE IN A MEDIUM SIZE WOULD -- COULD BE JUST ZONING REVIEW BILLING PERMIT. PART OF THAT CONVERSATION TOO.E
04:12:59.366: >> Comssioner Sauve: YES, I THINK WE STRIKE EVERYTHING UP TO N. AX. THEY ARE ALL N.A. WHICH MEANS IT DOESN'T LAND ON THE SITE PLANNING TABLE ANYMORE.
04:13:13.814: >> Chair Mills: YEAH.
04:13:14.315: >> Commissioner Sauve: AND THEY WERE ON THIS TABLE PREVIOUSLY BECAUSE THEY WERE COMBINED AS FAR AS WHAT REQUIRES AND WHAT DOESN'T REQUIRE A SITE PLAN. SO I THINK A LOT OF THIS DISCUSSION WAS OVER THE PAST YEARS REALIZING THE BENEFIT OF OUTDOOR SPACES AND LOWERING THE LIMIT OF BEING ABLE TO HAVE BUILDING OWNERS IMPROVE THAT SPACE FOR PEOPLE TO USE.
04:13:46.347: >> Planning Manager:  SO STRIKING PATIO PLACER OFF OF THE SITE PLAN TABLE?
04:13:58.258: >> Chair Mills: AND BY DEFAULT IT ONLY GOES THROUGH ZONING AND BUILDING PERMITS. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT CHANGES ANY ACCESSIBLE BUILDING IF UPPER DECKS ARE CONSIDERED ANY OF THOSE THINGS. THEY ARE NOT SPECIFICALLY BELOW. I THINK THEY WOULD FALL BACK INTO THE TOP LINE ON THAT PAGE, WHICH IS NOT THE INTENTION.
04:14:23.417: >> Planning Manager:  WELL YOU KNOW -- [ LOW AUDIO ] OUTDOOR DECK AND PATIO LAZ ARE -- IT'S BY THEIR NATURE RELATIVELY FLAT UNENCLOSED AND LACKING VERTICAL, I WOULD SAY. AND THEN -- AND ACCESSORY BUILDING. STRUCTURE OR CANOPY -- ANYTHING UNDER THIS IS ANYTHING THAT'S NOT A DECK, A PATIO, PLAZA GREATER THAN 1,000 SQUARE FEET. SO THAT'S GOING TO INCLUDE -- I THINK IT'S GOING TO -- WE WOULD PROBABLY SAY ANY OTHER ACCESSORY BUILDING OR STRUCTURE, A BUILDING UP TO 300 SQUARE FEET OR A PATIO, DECK OR PLAZA UP TO 1,000 SQUARE FEET. NO, THAT'S NOT RIGHT. SO IF WE STRIKE THAT ROW, THE IMPACT IS GOING TO BE IN AN OUTDOOR PATIO IS 500 SQUARE FEET. IT'S GOING TO FALL TOO THAT TOP ROW SO I -- I THINK IT ACTUALLY MIGHT MAKE MORE SENSE TO LEAVE IT AS A -- UP TO 1,000 SQUARE FEET AND JUST MAKE IT D.A. ACROSS WHERE WE ARE DEFINING IT. WE ARE SAYING IT'S IN. A. THE LARGER PATIO IS DEFINED BY ITS REQUIREMENT AND THEN THE OTHER LINE WILL STAND ON ON ITS OWN.
04:16:06.687: >> Chair Mills: OKAY. I HAVE A COUPLE OF OTHER TYPE -- I DON'T KNOW IF THEY ARE SCRIVENER ERRORS OR THIS KIND OF THING. AND ACTUALLY, BECAUSE THIS IS A CHANGE, LIKE WE -- THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD NEED TO NOTE AS, LIKE -- WE SHOULD HAVE DISCUSSIONS OF THAT, BECAUSE THAT'S TECHNICALLY LIKE A -- YOU KNOW, A PROPOSED AMENDMENT. IS THERE ANY MORE DISCUSSION OF THAT? IS THERE ANYONE WHO THINKS THOSE SIZED DECKS SHOULD BE FALLING TO -- SHOULD GO THROUGH THE SITE PLAN PROCESS? #. MR. LENART?
04:16:45.659: >> Planning Manager:  HOW WOULD A TENT ON THAT IMPACT YOUR DECISION? LET ME REPHRASE THAT. HOW WOULD A TENT PUT UP FROM MEMORIAL DAY TO LABOR DAY --
04:17:05.879: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: RIGHT.
04:17:10.751: >> Planning Manager:  VERSUS A BEER GROTTO, MORE PERMANENT TENT. WOULD IT PACT YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT SIZE OF PLAZA? AND MAYBE IT'S GETTING LATE WHERE WE NEED TO JUST --
04:17:35.409: >> Chair Mills: I WAS GOING TO SAY, IT'S GETTING LATE AND IT'S DIFFICULT FOR ME TO THINK THROUGH ALL OF IT, AND I THINK THERE'S A COUPLE OF OTHER THINGS THAT, LIKE, GOODEN, MAYBE IT -- THAT ARE DIFFERENT FROM O.R.C., AND MAYBE WE DISCUSS THEM AND I CAN PUT THEM IN AN EMAIL. BUT THAT I THINK THAT WE SHOULD MAKE SURE THAT WE UNDERSTAND SO -- SO -- YEAH. MAYBE IT MAKES SENSE TO POSTPONE. FOR THE LIST NOW, THOUGH, I CAN GO THROUGH THOSE OTHER THINGS THAT I HAVE, JUST SO -- SO THAT YOU KNOW AND TO POINT OUT CLARIFICATION. THIS IS RELOCATION OF REFUGE -- REFUSES WAS PREVIOUSLY PROPOSED AS LEVEL THREE. IT'S NOT APPEARING ON HERE. SO I THINK IT MEANS IT'S NOW EXEMPT OR I ASSUME IT MEANS IT'S EXEMPT. I'M NOT -- I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I'M OKAY WITH THAT. I THINK, BUT I WANT TO RAISE THAT, BECAUSE THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE -- ADDITION OF CARPORTS OVER VEHICULAR USE AREAS ALSO NOW EXEMPT. THAT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT WE'RE EXE EXEMPTING THIS.
04:18:51.518: >> THE WIRELESS COMMUNICATION TOURS, REPLACEMENT OF THOSE OR ENHANCEMENT. I DON'T SEE THAT. SO I THINK THAT --
04:19:00.927: >> Planning Manager:  THE SITE PLAN.
04:19:03.296: >> Chair Mills: I THINK WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT IT AT O.R.C., I THINK WE SAID IT WAS LEVEL THREE. BUT THE TABLE IN THE O.R.C. PACKET JUST THE OTHER THING THAT'S ON THE NATURAL FEATURES SECTION. THERE'S A REFERENCE TO LEVEL THREE WHICH WE DON'T HAVE LEVEL THREE ANY MORE. SO THAT'S JUST KIND OF CLEANING UP SOME OF THAT LANGUAGE. SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THIS NEXT TIME, LIKE, DOING A LITTLE BIT MORE INVESTIGATION. YEAH.
04:19:38.765: >> Planning Manager:  I WOULD SUGGEST POSTPONEMENT TO THE SEPTEMBER 8th MEETING, PERHAPS.
04:19:46.606: >> Chair Mills: SOUNDS FINE. WOULD ANYBODY LIKE TO MOVE THAT? MOVED BY COMMISSIONER WYCHE AND SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL. ANY DISCUSSION OF POSTPONEMENT IT? ALL IN FAVOR, PLEASE RAISE YOUR HAND. THAT'S ALL THE HANDS. OKEYDOKE NEXT ON OUR AGENDA IS NEW BUSINESS, INCLUDING THE BYLAWS BUT I WANT TO LET YOU -- REMIND YOU THAT IN THE BYLAWS, WE TAKE UP ANYTHING ELSE AFTER 11:00 WITHOUT A VOTE. I ALSO REMIND YOU THAT WE TOOK THIS UP TWO WEEKS AGO. WE GOT DONE QUICK BUT SOMEBODY NEEDS TO -- IS ANYBODY INTERESTED IN MOVING COMMISSIONER SAUVE TO EXTEND THE MEETING TO TAKE UP THE LAST -- THE ITEMS OF NEW BUSINESS? SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT. ANY DISCUSSION? OKAY. ALL IN FAVOR OF TAKING UP THE NEW BUSINESS? ALL OPPOSED? I THINK THAT THE BYLAWS SAY IT'S A MAJORITY. SO COMMISSIONER DISCH WAS OPPOSED. BEAR WITH US, COMMISSIONER DISCH. THANK YOU. THE BYLAWS REVIEW OF THE BYLAWS, STAFF. THERE'S NO PUBLIC HEARING.
04:21:07.788: >> Planning Manager:  I'M SORRY FOR THE RECONSIDERATION OF THIS, THE PROPOSED BYLAWS HAVE PREVIOUS CHANGES THAT YOU HAVE ALREADY MADE. THE ADDITIONAL CHANGES BEING PROPOSED ELIMINATE THE INTRODUCTIONS ITEMS -- THE DIRECTION ITEM AS A STANDING AGENDA ITEM WE CAN ALWAYS MAKE AN INTRODUCTION WITHOUT IT BEING WITHOUT ASTANDING AGENDA ITEM. THEY HAVE NEGATIVE CONNOTATIONS TO STRIKE USES OF SLAVERY AND PATERNALISM AND SO THE BYLAWS WILL BE CHANGES TO REFLECT THE COMPREHENSIVE PLAN. MAKING A COUPLE OF REFERENCES AND CHANGES TO JUST REFERRING TO THE COMPREHENSIVE PLAN AS THE PLAN AND THE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS PLAN AS THE C.I.P. TO DISTINGUISH THOSE AND LASTLY CHANGING THE ATTENDANCE EXPECTATIONS TO MATCH THOSE THAT WERE RECENTLY ADOPTED BY THE CITY COUNCIL TO APPLY TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION, ALTHOUGH WITH SOME ADJUSTMENTS AND INCREASE BECAUSE THE LAPPINE PLANNING COMMISSION MEETS MORE THAN THE ENERGY COMMISSION. IT BASICALLY MEANS IF YOU DON'T SHOW UP WITHOUT NOTIFYING US AFTER SEVERAL MEETINGS, THE CHAIR COULD CONTACT THE MAYOR AND REQUEST YOUR REMOVAL. IT DOESN'T MANDATE IT. AND IF ALL OF THAT SOUNDS GOOD AS PRESENTED IN THE STAFF REPORT, A MOTION TO ADOPT AS PRESENTED.
04:22:37.544: >> Chair Mills: WOULD SOMEONE MAKE THE MOTION TO AOF PRO THE BYLAWS AS PRESENTED.
04:22:41.681: >> MOVED BY COMMISSIONER WCHE AND SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL. ALL THOSE IN FAVOR PLEASE SAY AYE OR RAISE YOUR HAND. I SEE EVERYBODY'S HANDS. SO THAT MOTION CARRIES. THE NEXT COUPLE OF BUSINESS IS ELECTION OF OFFICERS.
04:23:04.838: >> Planning Manager:  THE ELECTION OF OFF OFFICERS IT HAPS ON AND --UAL BASIS. THREE LITTLE BIRDIES TOLD ME THAT THE CURRENT SLATE OF OFFICERS CHAIR MILLS, VICE CHAIR GIBB-RANDALL AND SECRETARY ABRONS ARE ALL WILLING TO CONTINUE TO SERVE IN THAT CAPACITY. AND THEY MAY DO SO FOR ONE ADDITIONAL YEAR BEFORE THE OTHER OF YOU WILL BE THRUST INTO SIMILAR ROLES. SO EXHIBITTENT WITH THAT, A COMMISSIONER -- CONSISTENT WITH THAT A COMMISSIONER COULD MOVE TO AREAPPOINT THAT SLATE OF OFFICERS FOR ANOTHER YEAR.
04:23:40.073: >> Chair Mills: MOVED BY COMMISSIONER WYCHE, AND SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT. ANY DISCUSSION OR ARE THERE -- LIKE --
04:23:52.686: >> Planning Manager:  ARE THERE ANY OTHER NOMINATIONS?
04:23:56.589: >> Chair Mills: ANY OTHER NOMINATIONS? ALL RIGHT. L THOSE IN FAVOR OF THE SLATE OF OFFICERS, PLEASE RAISE YOUR HAND. THAT IS ALL HANDS. SO THE MOTION CARRIES. ITEM 11 IS PUBLIC COMMENT. DO HAVE A ALL CALLER. SO THIS IS YOUR OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK FOR UP TO THREE MINUTES ABOUT ANY ITEM OF INTEREST. IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS PLANNING COMMISSION AT THIS TIME, YOU CAN PRESS STAR NINE ON YOUR PHONE IF YOU HAVE CALLED IN. FOR THOSE WHO ARE LISTENING INEN WOULD -- IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A PUBLIC COMMENT, PLEASE CALL 877-853-5247 AND ENTER MEETING I.D.97766341226. CITY STAFF WILL CALL ON THOSE WOULD HAVE RAISED THEIR HAND DIGITALLY, AND AT THE BEGINNING OF YOUR COMMENTS, PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS AND MUTE ANY BACKGROUND SOUNDS.
04:24:55.348: >> Planning Manager:  CALLER ENDING IN 955 YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING.
04:25:01.554: >> KURT WESTPHAL, 355 CHARTER PLACE. I WON'T BE AS LONG WINDED AS BEFORE. I APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK YOU ARE DOING. I -- I GUESS WITH REGARD TO THE PETITION THAT YOU SAW TONIGHT, AS WELL AS SOME OTHERS THAT DON'T REFLECT THE FUTURE PLAN FOR OUR CORRIDORS, I WONDER IF THERE'S A WAY TO KIND OF TACKLE, YOU KNOW, THIS ISSUE WHILE WE'RE WAITING TO GET THOSE CORRIDORS REZONED. MY SENSE IS THAT GIVEN THE LONG TIME FRAME, YOU MAY BE SEEING MORE AND MORE OF THESE PETITIONS WHICH CAN BE BUILT BY RIGHT, YOU KNOW, MINUS THE DRIVE THRU, OF COURSE. AND IT WOULD BE A SHAME TO S TH HAPPEN BNG WHILE WE ARE UNDERGOING THE REZONINGS. SO I GUESS I WOULD JUST ASK YOU TO THINK ABOUT WHAT CAN BE DONE IN THE MEANTIME. I'M NOT A BIG FAN OF MORATORIUMS, BUT THAT CAN BE USED RESPONSIBLY FOR SHORT
