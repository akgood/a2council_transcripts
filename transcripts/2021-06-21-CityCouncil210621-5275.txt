00:05:09.079: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING IN 556, GO AHEAD? MR. McKEE, YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND UNMUTE YOURSELF.
00:05:17.621: >> HOW IS THIS? AM I UNMUTED NOW?
00:05:21.358: >> Mayor Taylor: WE CAN HEAR YOU NOW.
00:05:23.293: >> RALPH MCKEE, I HAVE TWO TOPICS GELMAN AND NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS WITH THE COMMON THREAD LACK OF TRANSPARENCY. I HAVE WRITTEN AND SPOKEN ON THESE TOPICS BEFORE BUT A QUICK REVIEW IS ON ORDER. THIS BODY, SCIO AND THE BODY REJECTED CONSENT JUDGMENT FOUR. THEN JUDGE INTER INTERRUPTED COS OPENING STATEMENT, SAID HE WOULD REINSTATE CJ4. AND THE JUDGE SAID, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I WROTE. YET THE ORDER THAT'S SCIO TOWNSHIP, BILL STAPLETON FROM MAYOR TAYLOR'S LAW FIRM PREPARED AND OUR CITY ATTORNEY INCORPORATED ALL OF CJ4, OPPOSITE OF WHAT THIS BODY WORKED WITH. CARD ACTIVISTS WERE OUTRAGED BY THIS. IT PUTS THE WETLANDS WE WERE ALL CONCERNED ABOUT AT RISK AGAIN AND ALLOWS GELMAN TO GET OUT OF RUNNING EXTRACTION WELLS AT 500 PARTS PER BILLION WHICH HAD BEEN DEEMED UNACCEPTABLE. TWO WEEKS AGO I WROTE YOU ASKING TO GET A PUBLIC EXPLANATION AND REPEATED THAT REQUEST AT THE END OF THE MEETING, PUBLIC COMMENT. I WAS TOLD THAT THE ADMIN COMMITTEE MEETING THE NEXT DAY COUNCILMEMBER EYER EXPRESSED ANGER RE MY REQUEST AND I HEARD THAT THE CITY ATTORNEY SENT YOU A PRIVILEGED MEMO. WHILE USING PRIVILEGE TO PROTECT COMMUNICATIONS IS OFTEN APPROPRIATE, IT ISN'T HERE. THE PUBLIC IS E ENTITLED TO SEE WHY THE ATTORNEYS USURPED THE POLICYMAKERS INCLUDING YOURS AND ULTIMATELY OUR DECISIONS WITHOUT EVEN TALKING TO YOU FIRST. REMEMBER THIS IS NOT JUST ME. THIS IS THE VAST MAJORITY OF CARD PARTICIPANTS TALKING. THE LACK OF TRANSPARENCY ON A MAJOR ITEM LIKE THIS IS TRULY STUNNING. NEXT, NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS WHILE LESSER IMPORTANCE IS SIMILAR. MR. HESS SAID AT RECENT MEETINGS THAT IN CHOOSING WHICH STREETS TO CLOSE HE RELIED ON PURPORTED DIRECTION FROM THIS BODY TO AWAIT VIEWS OF THE PROPOSED CLOSED STREETS MUCH MORE HEAVILY, PERHAPS FROM PEOPLE PEOPLEUSING STREETS AS CONNECTO. SO A STAFF PERSON APPEARS TO HAVE MADE DECISIONS BASED ON NONEXISTENT DIRECTIONS FROM YOU. NEXT, WHEN CHALLENGED RAY HOW HE COMPILED THE PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT DATA, MR. HESS HE CHOSE NOT TO COUNT COMMENTS AGAINST THE PROGRAM IF THE COMMENTER HAD PRESSED THE OTHER BUTTON. PURPORTEDLY TO AVOID MISINTERPRETING THE COMMENTS. WHILE SOME COMMENTS WERE INDEED AMBIGUOUS, A COMMENT LIKE THIS PROGRAM IS STUPID IS HOARD TO HO MISREAD. AGAIN, I THINK THE PUBLIC IS ENTITLED TO KNOW HOW THESE DECISIONS WERE MADE TO CLOSE THE STREETS, PARTICULARLY THE JEWETT, ROSEWOOD, SUMMIT AND SUNSET. THE COMMENTS WERE 22-4 AGAINST CLOSING J JEWETT. I HOPE YOU AND THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR TAKE THESE ISSUES SERIOUSLY BUT GIVEN RECENT EXPERIENCE, THAT HOPE IS FADING FAST.
00:08:25.809: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
00:08:26.710: >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR LISTENING AND HAVE A GOOD EVENING.
00:08:32.182: >> THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS MOZHGAN SAVABIEASFAHANI. CLERK CALLER WITH THE CLONE NUMBER ENDING IN 941.
00:08:56.807: >> THIS IS MOZHGAN SAVABIEASFAHANI. ANN ARBOR COUNCIL IS A BUNCH OF RACIST BASTARDS. HOW DO I KNOW? TAKE A LOOK AT THEIR RECORD FOR THE PAST 20 YEARS. WE ARE LITERALLY ON THE TOP OF A TOXIC WASTE DUMP WHILE THEY HOBNOB WITH LAWYERS AND GELMAN AND HAVE LUNCHEONS AND SPEND OUR MONEY ON FANCY LAWYERS FEES ON THE BIGGEST DIOXANE CONTAMINATION IN THE WORLD. THIS IS A BUNCH OF REACTIONARY RACIST BASTARDS WHO HAVE ALLOWED THIS TO HAPPEN. THEY KEEP TALKING ABOUT PUBLIC HOUSING AND HOUSING FOR POOR AND HOUSING FOR PEOPLE, WHILE THEY PROMOTE THE DEVELOPERS WHO ARE FILLING THEIR POCKETS WITH THEIR MONEY. THERE'S MORE THAN ENOUGH LUXURY HOUSING AND NO PUBLIC HOUSING. THIS IS T THE BUNCH. THIS IS FRUIT OF THEIR LABOR. THEY ARE SO OBSCENELY RACIST THAT WE DON'T EVEN HAVE A $15 MINIMUM WAGE RULE. THEY DON'T STAND UP FOR IT. WHAT'S MORE, THEY HAVE TURNED THEIR BACK FULLY ON THE PUBLIC IN ANN ARBOR, WHO HAVE STOOD UP OVER AND OVER AND ASKED FOR A RESOLUTION TO CUT OFF MILITARY AID TO ISRAEL. THOUSANDS OF US SHOWED UP AT THEIR DOOR STEP A FEW WEEKS AGO. STUDENTS HAVE BEEN DEMANDING SANCTIONS AGAINST THAT RACIST APARTHEID STATE, BUT THIS RACIST BUNCH OF ANN ARBOR CITY COUNCIL STANDS BY THE APARTHEID RACIST STATE OF ISRAEL. ANN ARBOR CITY COUNCIL A BUNCH OF RACIST BASTARDS AND THEY KNOW IT. AND WE KNOW IT AND WE WILL VOTE YOU OUT. YOU ARE RACIST TO THE BONE. YOU TURNED YOUR BACKS TO THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN THIS TOWN, WHO HAVE DEMANDED CUTTING OFF AID TO ISRAEL. WE DON'T KNOW HOW ELSE TO TALK TO YOU AND YOU WILL SUPPORT THE ARTHEID RACIST STATEF ISRL YOUR COMPLETE SILENCE, BY YOUR COMPLETE SILENCE.
00:11:20.684: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
00:11:21.852: >> YOU ARE A RACIST BUNCH. WE KNOW THAT YOU ARE A RACIST BUNCH OF BASTARDS. WE KNOW IT AND WE DESPISE IT AND WE WILL SPEAK FROM TODAY UNTIL THE END OF TIME TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY KNOWS IT AND WE WILL VOTE YOU OUT. PASS THE RESOLUTION THAT SAYS, NO MILITARY AID TO ISRAEL. DO IT NOW! DO IT NOW AND REDEEM YOURSELF! SHAME ON YOU! I DON'T HAVE ANY WORDS TO DESCRIBE YOUR BRUTAL BEHAVIOR. I HAVE SAID ALL THAT I COULD.
00:12:00.257: >> Clerk Beaudry: TIME.
00:12:00.791: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS BLAINE COLEMAN.
00:12:07.631: >> CAN YOU HEAR ME?
00:12:09.466: >> Mayor Taylor: YES, WE CAN.
00:12:13.069: >> ISRAEL JUST MASSACRED HUNDREDS OF PALESTINIANS, JUST LAST MONTH WITH YOUR GUNS, YOUR AIRCRAFT, YOUR MONEY, AND AS A RESULT, YOUR BASE, THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS RUNNING TOWARDS SOLIDARITY WITH THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE. LIBERAL DEMOCRATS ARE RUNNING TO SYMPATHIZE WITH THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE. YOU THE ANN ARBOR CITY COUNCIL IS RUNNING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. WHY? I THINK YOU ARE BEHIND THE TIMES. YOU ARE TEACHING YOUR CHILDREN THAT KILLING PALESTINIANS IS NOTHING TO PUBLICLY COMPLAIN ABOUT. KATHY GRISWOLD, ARE YOU A COUNCILMEMBER WOULD KEEPS YOUR WORD? YOU PROMISED TO INTRODUCE THE RESOLUTION AGAINST MILITARY AID TO ISRAEL. ARE YOU GOING TO KEEP YOUR WORD? ARE YOU? QUITE RECENTLY, YOU GOT DOWN ON YOUR KNEES AND APOLOGIZED TO CITY COUNCIL FOR EVEN BRINGING A RESOLUTION THAT MENTIONED THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE. ARE YOU FINALLY GOING TO KEEP YOUR WORD AND INTRODUCE THE RESOLUTION AGAINST THE MILITARY AID TO ISRAEL. JEFF HAYNER, YOU PROMISED OVER AND OVER AGAIN TO INTRODUCE THE RESOLUTION THAT SAYS SEVEN LITTLE WORDS, "WE ARE AGAINST MILITARY AID TO ISRAEL." ARE YOU FINALLY GOING TO KEEP YOUR WORD? ARE YOU A COUNCILMEMBER WHO KEEPS YOUR WORD? ARE YOU FINALLY GOING TO INTRODUCE THE RESOLUTION? YOU EVEN TOLD MLIVE THAT YOU WERE GOING TO INTRODUCE THE RESOLUTION AGAINST MILITARY AID TO ISRAEL. YOU NEVER DID. ARE YOU A COUNCILMEMBER WHO KEEPS YOUR WORD? WHAT ARE YOU TEACHING YOUR CHILDREN? WHAT ARE YOU TEACHING YOUR CHILDREN WHEN YOU SHOW THEM THAT THE LIVES OF PALESTINIANS ARE SO INCONSEQUENTIAL TO YOU, THAT THEY ARE HARDLY EVEN WORTH MENTIONING IN PUBLIC. WHAT ARE YOU TEACHING YOUR CHILDREN? YOU ARE TEACHING THEM TO KILL PALESTINIANS, TO KEEP KILLING THEM, TO KEEP GIVING ISRAEL MORE GUNS, MORE AIRCRAFT, TO KEEP KILLING PALESTINIANS. THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE TEACHING YOUR CHILDREN. DO YOU REALLY WANT TO TEACH YOUR CHILDREN THAT?
00:14:42.519: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
00:14:44.220: >> DO YOU HAVE SUCH A LOW OPINION OF THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE THAT YOU ARE WILLING TO JUST HAND ISRAEL UNLIMITED MONEY FOR UNLIMITED PERIODS OF TIME UNTIL THEY KILL EVERY LAST PALESTINIAN? IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT TO TEACH YOUR CHILDREN? IF YOUR HOLE BASE IS RUNNING AWAY FROM THIS, SHOULDN'T YOU BE FOLLOWING YOUR BASE? I THINK YOU SHOULD.
00:15:20.323: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. THE NEXT SPEAKER IS IRMA MAJER.
00:15:38.875: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING IN 835. IRMA MAJERS. PRESS STAR SIX TO UNMUTE YOUR PHONE.
00:15:47.017: >> OKAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD EVENING. I'M IRMA MAJER AND I LIVE IN THE THIRD WARD. I'M CALLING TONIGHT ABOUT A CITY ISSUE. I WOULD LIKE TO URGE THE COUNCIL AND MAYOR TO REEVALUATE THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE PLANNING COMMISSION AND CONSIDER WHETHER IT TRULY REPRESENTS THE OCCUPATION, BACKGROUNDS AND INTERESTS OF ANN ARBOR RESIDENTS. THIS ADVISORY GROUP IS COMPOSED EXCLUSIVELY OF PERSONS WITH PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL BACKGROUNDS IN REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT, BUILDING AND OTHER RELATED FIELDS. THEIR BACKGROUNDS INCLUDE URBAN PLANNING, ARCHITECTURE, REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT AND SALES PROPERTY MANAGEMENT. ALL FIELDS THAT HAVE A DIRECT STAKE IN THE ISSUES THAT COME FORWARD TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION. THE CURRENT MEMBERSHIP DOES NOT SUFFICIENTLY REPRESENT ANN ARBOR'S RESIDENTS, ALL OF WHOM HAVE A STAKE IN THE DECISIONS THIS BODY MAKES. ACCORDING TO THE COMMISSION'S OWN BYLAWS, MEMBERS SHOULD REPRESENT DIFFERENT PROFESSIONS AND OCCUPATIONS, REPRESENTATIVE OF IMPORTANT SEGMENTS OF COMMUNITY, SUCH AS THE ECONOMIC, GOVERNMENTAL, EDUCATIONAL AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE CITY. REPRESENTATION SHOULD INCLUDE THE MAJOR INTERESTS SUCH AS NATURAL RESOURCES, RECREATION, EDUCATION, PUBLIC HEALTH, TRANSPORTATION, INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE. WHERE ON THIS COMMISSION ARE EDUCATORS, SOCIAL SERVICE PROFESSIONALS, FAITH LEADERS, HEALTH PROFESSIONALS, AS WELL AS UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITIES WHO SURELY HAVE AN INTEREST IN THE GROWTH AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CITY. FURTHER, THE BYLAWS STATE THAT MEMBERSHIP SHALL ALSO BE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ENTIRE GEOGRAPHY OF THE CITY, THE CURRENT MEMBERS OF THE COMMISSION, ONLY ONE LIVES SOUTH OF STADIUM BOULEVARD. WHY IS THIS A PROBLEM? THE CURRENT MAKEUP OF THE PLANNING COMMISSION DOES NOT ALLOW FOR A HEALTHY AND INCLUSIVE DEBATE ON THE MANY ZONING, LAND USE, AND DEVELOPMENT ISSUES FACING OUR CITY. OUR CITY HAS ENTERED A TIME OF UNPRECEDENTED DEVELOPMENT AND IS MAKING CONSEQUENTIAL CHOICES ABOUT MAJOR CHANGES TO INFRASTRUCTURE, TRANSPORTATION, AND ENERGY CONSERVATION. THESE DECISIONS WON'T HAVE IMMEDIATE AND DIRECT IMPACT, EXCUSE ME, ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE AND THE SENSE OF COMMUNITY IN ANN ARBOR. BUT THIS COMMISSION DOES NOT REPRESENT -- SORRY, A CROSS-SECTION OF ANN ARBOR'S RESIDENTS. I BELIEVE IT IS EXCEPTIONALLY IMPORTANT TO HAVE MORE DIVERSE AND EQUITABLE PARTICIPATION ON THE PLANNING COMMISSION AND OTHER CITY COMMISSIONS.
00:18:22.772: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
00:18:25.241: >> IT IS IN VIOLATION OF ITS BYLAWS. I URGE YOU, MAYOR TAYLOR, AND COUNCILMEMBERS, TO RECTIFY THIS AS AN IMMEDIATE AND HIGH PRIORITY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
00:18:37.120: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER LEFIEST GALIMORE.
00:18:50.667: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING IN 099. LEFIEST GALIMORE, IF YOU PRESS STAR SIX, YOU CAN UNMUTE YOUR PHONE. OKAY. CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW?
00:19:11.654: >> Mayor Taylor: YES, WE CAN.
00:19:12.889: >> MY NAME IS LEFIEST GALIMORE AND I LIVE AT 3039 PLYMOUTH ROAD IN ANN ARBOR. ABOUT A MONTH AGO, I SPOKE WITH THE MAYOR ABOUT HIS SPONSORSHIP OF A RESOLUTION TO ESTABLISH JUNETEENTH AS A CITY HOLIDAY. THIS WAS SUPPORTED BY MEMBERS OF CITY COUNCIL. MY QUESTION TO ALL OF YOU, HOW DOES THIS RESOLUTION IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF BLACKS IN ANN ARBOR. I CAME TO ANN ARBOR IN 1971. AT THAT TIME BLACKS WERE THE SECOND LARGEST POPULATION GROUP IN ANN ARBOR. BLACKS OWNED HOMES AND THE SPECIFIC NEIGHBORHOODS THEY LIVED IN. THROUGH GENTRIFICATION AND OTHER DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES, BLACKS ARE NOW THE THIRD LARGEST GROUP WITHIN ANN ARBOR AND IN TEN YEARS WILL PROBABLY BE THE FOURTH POPULATION GROUP. MY QUESTION TO ALL OF YOU:  HOW DOES PASSING A RESOLUTION ESTABLISH JUNETEENTH AS A CITY HOLIDAY GOING TO IMPACT THE ISSUES OF BLACK STUDENTS, ABUSE IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM. HOW DOES THIS JUSTIFY THAT BLACK YOUTH ARE MORE APT TO END UP IN JUVENILE DETENTION, INSTEAD OF GIVING JOB OPPORTUNITIES AND EMPLOYMENT THAT MAY DIVERT THEM FROM THE SYSTEM? HOW DOES THIS RESOLUTION ADJUST THE FACT THAT WE HAVE CITIZENS OF THIS COUNTRY WHO ARE ENSLAVED UNDER THE MOST BRUTAL SYSTEM OF TREATMENT OF THE HISTORY OF HUMAN -- OF CIVILIZATION IN ITS HISTORY OF CIVILIZATION, AND THE BRIDGES AND THE WOODS, BUT THESE INDIVIDUALS TO THIS COUNTRY FROM OTHER PLACES, EXCEPT THE RESOURCES AND SERVICES FROM THIS COMMUNITY. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO SPENT 400 YEARS OF FREE LABOR HELPING TO BUILD THIS COUNTRY BUT YET TO NOT BE TREATED AS DECENT CITIZENS OF THIS COUNTRY. HOW DOES THIS JUSTIFY YOUNG BLACKS WHO GREW UP IN THIS COMMUNITY WHO CHOOSE TO LEAVE BECAUSE THEY DO NOT FORESEE BEING A PART OF THIS COMMUNITY IN THE FUTURE? MR. MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL, THERE ARE BLACKS IN ANN ARBOR WHO ARE TIRED OF YOUR PATERNALISTIC ATTITUDE ADDRESSING THE ISSUES INVOLVING THE BLACK COMMUNITY. YOU NEED TO LEARN HOW TO ENGAGE OR BUILD A SEGMENT OF THE BLACK COMMUNITY TO GET A GOOD FEEL FOR DECISIONS YOU ARE MAKING ABOUT A HOLIDAY OR ANY OTHER ACTIVITIES FOR BLACKS. SINCE I ARRIVED IN 1971, BLACKS HAVE NO MADE ANY PROGRESS. IF YOU DO A REGRESSION ANALYSIS, YOU WILL FIND THAT BLACKS HAVE ACTUALLY REGRESSED BUT AT ANY RATE, THANKS FOR YOUR WONDERFUL WORK THAT YOU HAVE DONE IN WORKING TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF ANN ARBOR BLACKS. THANK YOU.
00:21:57.520: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. ARE THERE COMMUNICATIONS TODAY FROM COUNCIL? COUNCILMEMBER NELSON?
00:22:08.531: >> CouncMS. BEAUDRY, MAY I HAVER HAND POWER. MY APOLOGIES, COUNCILMEMBER.
00:22:16.406: >> Councilmember Nelson: THANK YOU. I JUST WANTED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE DID HAVE A LOVELY JUNETEENTH CELEBRATION ON SATURDAY, WALKING FROM FLOWER PARK TO WHEELER PARK, EVEN THOUGH WE ALL GOT A LITTLE BIT WET. I ALSO WANTED TO SAY THAT STARTING TOMORROW, THERE'S GOING TO BE RESURFACING ON EASTOVER PLACE, FERDNAN DRIVE AND ST. FRANCIS DRIVE. I GOT NOTIFIED AS A WARD REPRESENTATIVE AND I ACTUALLY THINK ALL OF THOSE PLACES UNDER WARD THREE AND IT'S WARD FOUR ADJACENT. THANK YOU, THAT'S IT.
00:22:59.015: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER DISCH.
00:22:59.949: >> Councilmember Disch: I WOULD LIKE TO SAY I ENJOYED JUNETEENTH AND THE WALK IN THE TRAIN AND THE WALK  DANCE IN THE PARKING T IPY IS AND THE STORYTELLER. I WANTED TO CLARIFY TWO THINGS I SAID IN AN EARLIER MEETING. I SAID THAT TC1 ORDINANCE IS CURRENTLY DEVELOPER INITIATED. IT IS NOT A FIXED ZONING DISTRICT. I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT I SAID CURRENTLY. THIS IS NOT THE END FOR TC1. THELANNINGOMSSN IS EMBARKING -- WILL MBARKING TE TC1 PASS, WHICH IOPE IT WILL BE IN JUL ON A PROJECT TO PROACTIVELY REZONE SPECIFIC AREAS OF CITY AS TC1 AND THEY WILL BE BEGINNING WITH STATE AND EISENHOWER WHICH PLANNING COMMISSION PUT ON ITS WORK AGENDA AND WILL KEEP THERE WAS A TOP PRIORITY PROVIDED THAT TC1 PASSES COUNCIL. THANK YOU.
00:23:56.439: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
00:23:57.340: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WANT TO PUBLICLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WHILE I WORKED ON PEDESTRIAN SAFETY INITIATIVES FOR OVER TWO DECADES, I AM NO LONGER ENGAGED IN ANY OF THE PEDESTRIAN AND CYCLIST INITIATIVES IN ANN ARBOR. MY FOCUS IS ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES AND THE SUCCESSFUL EPA ANALYSIS OF THE GELMAN 1, 4, DIOXANE. THE HEALTHY STREETS AND THE RAPID FLASHING BEACONS ACROSS FIVE-LANE STREETS AND HURON PARKWAY AT GLACIER ARE NOT SUPPORTED BY GENERALLY ACCEPTED TRANSPORTATION STANDARDS, NOR CRASH DATA. EQUALLY IMPORTANT, THE PROJECTS REFLECT A LACK OF OPERATIONAL EXPERTISE:  COUNCIL HAS HAD MANY DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE NEED FOR OPERATIONAL EXPERTISE IN THE TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT, BUT IT IS STILL LACKING. THIS STATEMENT IS NOT A CRITICISM OF THE SKILLS OF THE EXISTING STAFF, BUT ANOTHER PLEA FOR THIS ADDITIONAL EXPERTISE WHICH COUNCIL FORMALIZED IN AT LEAST ONE RESOLUTION. THE RRFEs ON HURON PARKWAY AT GLACIER HIGHLIGHT THIS LACK OF OPERATIONAL EXPERTISE AND A LIMITED UNDERSTANDING OF THE VEHICLE, CYCLIST AND PEDESTRIAN MOVEMENTS AT THAT SITE. I WILL BE SENDING AN EMAIL OUTLINING WHAT SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS ARE. AT THIS POINT, I REQUEST THAT CITY STAFF EXAMINE THE ACTUAL OPERATION -- THE OPERATION NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE ON PAPER, BUT HOW THE VEHICLES AND THE PEDESTRIANS AND THE CYCLISTS INTERACT. AND TAKE WHATEVER ACTION IS NECESSARY TO IMPROVE PEDESTRIAN AND CYCLIST SAFETY IN THIS AREA. AGAIN, I JUST WANT TO REPEAT I AM NOT ASSOCIATED WITH THESE RECENT INFRASTRUCTURE CHANGES IN ANY I WHAT AND I DO NOT APPROVE THEM. THANK YOU.
00:25:57.126: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
00:25:57.994: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANKS, MR. MAYOR. I WANTED TO TAKE A MINUTE TO SAY HAPPY JUNETEENTH TO EVERYBODY. I HOPE THEY ENJOYED THE WE HAD. WE HAD SOME DYNAMIC WEATHER AND I WANT TO WISH EVERYBODY -- ALL THE FATHERS OUT THERE A BELATED HAPPY FATHER'S DAY AND ALSO, IT SOUNDS A LITTLE ODD, HAPPY SOLSTICE TO EVERYBODY. AND IT'S ALSO MY FATHER'S BIRTHDAY I DON'T KNOW IF HE WATCHES BUT IF HE DOES, HELLO. AND ENJOY YOUR BIRTHDAY. I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE HIM OVER THIS WEEKEND AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S ALWAYS NICE TO HAVE SOME FAMILIES IT REACH OUT. THANKS TO ALL THE DADS OUT THERE FOR TRYING YOUR BEST AND TAKE CARE, EVERYBODY.
00:26:39.869: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER COMMUNICATION FROM COUNCIL? I WOULD LIKE TO ECHO SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES. THANKS TO THE FOLKS WHO HAVE TAKEN THE LEAD, THE ACTIVISTS WHO TOOK THE LEAD IN PROMOTING AND OPERATING JUNETEENTH THROUGHOUT, YOU KNOW -- OVER THE DECADES. PARTICULARLY, THE LOCAL BRANCH, THE NAACP WHICH RAN ANOTHER EXCELLENT CONVERSATION OF THE HOLIDAY, ITS IMPORTANCE, BOTH AS A -- AS A CELEBRATION OF THE EMANCIPATION, BUT ALSO, YOU KNOW, PERHAPS EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY, AN UNDERSTANDING AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT FOR THAT WE A COUNTRY ARE FOUNDED AS A SLAVE NATION AND WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK TO DO TO REDEEM THE PROMISE OF FREEDOM FOR ALL MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY. I WOULD LIKE TO REQUEST CONFIRMATION OF THE FOLLOWING APPOINTMENTS PRESENTED TO CITY COUNCIL THE JUNE 7th MEETING, TO THE ANN ARBOR PUBLIC ARTS, MARIANETTA PORTER, BUILDING BOARD OF APPEALS Q FLACK AND ROBERT PARK.

COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
00:31:02.131: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, MAYOR. WELL, I'M PLEASED TO SEE SOME THINGS THAT ARE IN THIS RESOLUTION, I DO HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS FOR STAFF IF STAFF IS HERE TO ANSWER THEM. WITH THIS RESOLUTION, IT HAS A FEW -- A FEW THINGS IN IT WHICH HAVE QUESTIONS ON IT. THE WEEKEND COLLECTION SERVICE FOR RECYCLING IN THE DOWNTOWN BUSINESS DISTRICT IS SET TO BEGIN. WHEN WOULD THAT BEGIN? AND WHAT IS -- WHAT IS THE DEFINITION OF THE BUSINESS DISTRICT? ARE WE TALKING THE D.D.A. DISTRICT OR A SMALLER FOOTPRINT?
00:31:50.879: >> Mayor Taylor: YOU ARE ON MUTE.
00:31:55.651: >> CRAIG HUPY,.
00:31:59.388: >> YES, I SORRY, I WAS STILL GETTING LEFT IN. SO I HEARD THE LAST ONE ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THE BOUNDARIES FOR THE D.D.A. OR BROADER. WAS THERE ANOTHER QUESTION.
00:32:09.131: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, MOLLY. WHEN WILL THE COLLECTIONS BEGIN? AND I -- I'M INTERPRETING THIS AS JUST FOR RECYCLING ON SUNDAYS AND EXPANDED SERVICE. WHEN WOULD THOSE BEGIN AND WHAT IS THE DEFINITION, I GUESS OF THE BUSINESS DISTRICT OR THE GEOGRAPHICAL BOUNDARY AND THEN I HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION, AND I APOLOGIZE.
00:32:32.788: >> THIS IS ACTUALLY FOR TRASH. TRASH DUMPSTERS IN THE D.D.A. WILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE SUNDAY SERVICE. THERE'S A MINIMUM OF 20 ACCOUNTS TO SIGN UP, BUT NO MAXIMUM. SO THAT'S A DIFFERENCE FROM BEFORE. AND IT WILL BE ABLE TO START ONCE THE CONTRACT IS IN PLACE, COME JULY 1st AND PEOPLE START TO SIGN UP FOR SERVICE AND WE GET THAT 20.
00:32:55.644: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: WOW! WELL, THIS -- THIS IS WELCOMED NEWS, OBVIOUSLY. I'M SHOCKED. I DIDN'T THINK THAT WE WERE GOING TO SEE THIS SERVICE BEGIN SO SOON. SO WHAT IS -- SO YOU ARE SAYING THERE'S JUST 20 ADDRESSES OR 20 THAT WILL BE ABLE TO SIGN UP FOR IT?
00:33:17.099: >> SO UNDER THE PRIOR CONTRACT, THERE WAS A MAXIMUM NUMBER OF ACCOUNTS, A MAXIMUM NUMBER OF DUMPSTERS THAT WASTE MANAGEMENT COULD HANDLE ON A SUNDAY. THEY REMOVED THAT, BUT THERE'S A REQUIREMENT FOR AT LEAST 20 PROPERTIES, PARCELS, TO DUMPSTERS TO SIGN UP AND WE HAVE ALREADY STARTED ENGAGING WITH THE DOWNTOWN STAKEHOLDERS TO LET THEM KNOW OF THESE CHANGES AND THAN THAT, YOU KNOW OF THIS 20 REQUIREMENT AND IT'S NOT A VERY BIG NUMBER.
00:33:45.961: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: WOW. THANKS FOR BEING HERE AND THANKS FOR THE GOOD NEWS.

THANK YOU.
00:35:02.304: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
00:35:04.039: >> Councilmember Nelson: THANK YOU. I WOULD JUST LIKE TO ECHO WHAT MY COLLEAGUE JUST SAID AND ADD, THAT YOU MIGHT NO HAVE HEARD COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, THE COUNTY IS ALSO LIFTING RESTRICTIONS STARTING TOMORROW TO MIRROR WHAT THE STATE HAS DONE. AND SO, I MEAN, MY CHALLENGE WITH THIS IS THAT WE ARE APPLYING A SIMILAR SOLUTION, VERY, VERY DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES. AND WHAT WE LEARNED FROM LAST YEAR'S IMPLEMENTATIATIONS IS THT WHEN YOU CHOKE OFF TRAFFIC ON SOME STREETS, YOU ARE DIVERTING IT TO OTHER STREETS AND CREATES A PROBLEM SOMEWHERE ELSE. AND SO OUR SOLUTION WASO GO FROM 26 STREETS TO 34 STREETS. AND SO WE ARE DISTRIBUTING A BENEFIT TO 34 SEETS, AND SHIFNG THE BURDENND THE COS ONO WHATEVER SPILLOVER STREETS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO SHOULDER THAT TRAFFIC. AND IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE A VERY COMPREHENSIVE OR THOUGHTFUL SOLUTION. WE WILL HAVE MORE PROBLEMS MOVING FORWARD WHEN WE HEAR COMPLAINTS FROM THE RESIDENTS WHO SUDDENLY SEE THAT ALL THE CARS ARE LINING THEIR STREETS. THIS IS JUST SQUEEZING ONE END OF THE TUBE OF TOOTHPASTE AND HOPING THE TOOTHPASTE DISAPPEARS. IT WILL GO SOMEWHERE. I GUESS MY OTHER POINT WOULD BE -- I LOST MY TRAIN OF THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT THERE. I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS, UNFORTUNATELY. THIS IS NOT A SOLUTION THAT'S APPROPRIATE FOR THE TIME THAT WE ARE IN RIGHT NOW. IS JUST SIMPLY ISN'T. I'M SORRY. THANKS.
00:36:44.072: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
00:36:45.841: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES, I WON'T BE SUPPORTING THIS UNTIL WE HAVE THE OPERATIONAL EXPERTISE WITHIN OUR STAFF DEPARTMENT TO -- TO OVERSEE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ANY CHANGE, BUT IN REALITY, WHAT WE'RE DOING IS IN SOME CASES, WE'RE SENDING TRAFFIC AWAY FROM A STREET THAT HAS TWO SIDEWALKS. WE'RE CREATING A HEALTHY STREET ON THIS STREET A WITH TWO SIDEWALKS, AND WE'RE SENDING TRAFFIC TO STREET B WHICH DOES NOT HAVE SIDEWALKS. SO IT JUST DOESN'T REALLY MAKE SENSE. I AGREE. IT'S A TOTALLY DIFFERENT TIME, BUT IT SEEMS LIKE WE ARE SO FOCUSED ON BEING A PROGRESSIVE COMMUNITY. THAT WE ARE GOING TO DO HEALTHY STREETS WHETHER IT IS HARMFUL, WHETHER IT IS SAFE, AND IN SOME CASES, WE ARE SENDING PEOPLE OUT INTO A STREET, RATHER THAN ON SMOOTH SIDEWALKS TO A STREET THAT'S POCKED FULL, RIDDLED, I GET COMMUNICATIONS EVERY DAY FROM PEOPLE CONCERNED ABOUT THE QUALITY OF THEIR STREET WILL. SO WE'RE SPENDING MONEY ON THIS PROGRESSIVE BOONDOGGLE, RATHER THAN REPAIRING OUR STREETS WHICH IS A TOP PRIORITY OF OUR COMMUNITY.
00:38:14.062: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS.
00:38:15.464: >> Councilmember Briggs: THANK YOU. I WOULD LIKE TO -- I KNOW SOME FOLKS NEED TO VOICE THEIR ONGOING OPPOSITION TO, THIS BUT I WOULD LIKE TO VOICE MY ONGOING SUPPORT AND MY GRATITUDE TO STAFF THAT HAS WORKED VERY HARD AND DILIGENTLY TO BRING US THIS PROPOSAL FORWARD. THEIR EXPERTISE IS GREATLY VALUED. AND I APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT THEY HAVE DONE. I HAVE HEARD A FEW CRITICISMS AROUND THIS, ONE THAT THIS IS NO LONGER THE RIGHT TIME FOR THIS. I THINK IF YOU JUST DO A FEW GOOGLE SEARCHES, YOU WILL SEE THAT WE ARE NOT ALONE AS A PROGRESSIVE CITY IN TERMS OF HAVING SOME -- LEARNING SOME LESSONS EARLIER IN THE PANDEMIC AND CONTINUING WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED TO BE MOVING FORWARD SOME OF THOSE SUCCESSES. SO I'M EXCITED TO SEE THIS MOVE FORWARD. WE ALSO WANTED THE LESSONS WE LEARNED FROM LAST YEAR WAS THAT THERE WAS SOME SPILLOVER TRAFFIC ON TO OTHER STREETS SOMETIMES AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT TRANSPORTATION DID OR ASKED STAFF TO DO WAS TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT PROBLEM, AND TO COME BACK WITH A PROPOSAL THAT MIGHT PROACTIVELY ANTICIPATE THAT, AND SO SOME OF THOSE ADDITIONAL STREETS THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT FORWARD ARE ANTICIPATING THAT POTENTIAL ISSUE. AND IF ANY OF THE FOLKS THAT LIVE ON THOSE STREETS ARE -- FIND THAT THERE'S AN ISSUE, IT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT THEY COULD REACH OUT TO THE CITY ABOUT, BUT I'M EXCITED TO SEE THIS MOVE FORWARD AND, AGAIN, VERY THANKFUL TO STAFF.
00:39:50.459: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
00:39:51.326: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS. SINCE THIS WAS PASSED ORIGINALLY VVEE, THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE AT FAIR HAS BEEN MADE THAT IT WOULD RESUME THIS YEAR. I HAVE QUESTIONS WHETHER THERE WILL BE MODIFICATIONS TO ANY OF THIS RECONFIGURATION FOR ART FAIR. AND WHEN -- I APOLOGIZE, BUT WHEN WILL THE DEPLOYMENT END ON THE TEMPORARY INSTALLATIONS? AND ALSO IT SAYS THAT, YOU KNOW, 20% OR MORE OF THE NEIGHBORS ALONG THE SEGMENT VOICE OPPOSITION TO THE DEPLOYMENT AT ANY TIME THAT THE TREATMENTS WILL BE REMOVED. WHERE DO THEY GO TO VOICE THEIR OPPOSITION TO THE DEPLOYMENTS? THANK YOU. #.
00:40:45.146: >> RAYMOND HESS, TRANSPORTATION MANAGER. SOSO RELATED TO ART FAIR, WE ARE NOT ANTICIPATING ANY CHANGES TO THE PROGRAM. THERE ARE NO DIRECTLY IMMEDIATELY ADJACENT PROJECTS AS I UNDERSTAND IT. YOU KNOW THE CLOSEST ONE WOULD BE SOUTH MAIN STREET, BUT YOU KNOW, THE PART OF MAIN STREET THAT IS FULLY BLOCKED ON WEEKENDS PROBABLY HAS MORE OF A DIRECT IMPACT, BUT IN A GOOD WAY RELATED TO TRAFFIC CIRCULATION, AND THE NEIGHBORHOOD SLOW STREETS REALLY ARE FAR ENOUGH REMOVED THAT WE DIDN'T ANTICIPATE ANY OF THOSE. EAST PACKARD IS A LITTLE WAYS AWAY FROM WHERE THE ART FAIR AND WE DIDN'T ANTICIPATE ANY DIRECT IMPACTS FROM THAT. IN TERMS OF HOW LONG WE EXPECT THE DEPLOYMENT TO GO TO, SIMILAR TO LAST YEAR, WE EXPECT THE TEMPORARY DEPLOYMENTS TO GO UNTIL ABOUT NOVEMBER. AGAIN, AS WE START TO PREPARE FOR WINTER MAINTENANCE AND THE ONSET OF KNOW IS WHEN THOSE TEMPORARY DEPLOYMENTS BE REMOVED. AND I DID ACCIDENTALLY SKIP OVER YOUR MIDDLE QUESTION.
00:41:53.715: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: WHERE DO RESIDENTS GO TO VOICE THEIR OPPOSITION IF THERE'S MORE THAN 20% IN A PARTICULAR SEGMENT?
00:42:04.092: >> YES. THEY CAN CALL -- THERE'S A PHONE NUMBER IDENTIFIED ON THE WEBSITE OR HEALTHY STREETS EMAIL ADDRESS AS WELL. SO HEALTHYSTREETS@A2.GOV.
00:42:26.514: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
00:42:29.351: >> Councilmember Griswold: ANOTHER CONCERN I WANT TO RAISE IS IN LOOKING AT OTHER COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE HEALTHY STREETS, OR SLOW STREETS, MOST OF THOSE ARE SIMPLIMENTED ON TRULY NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS. IN NOMAR GARC ANN ARBOR, WE -- N ARBOR, WE ARE IMPLEMENTING THE TRAFFIC CALMING SUCH AS UNSETH, SUMMIT, CHAPIN, SOME OF THE STREETS THAT REALLY ARE NOT JUST NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS, AND MANY NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS DON'T NEED A HEALTHY STREET DESIGNATION BECAUSE THEY ARE ALREADY HEALTHY STREETS AND PEOPLE ARE WORKING IN THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS. I LIVE ON THE NORTHEAST SIDE OF ANN ARBOR AND PEOPLE WALK IN THE STREETS EVEN WHEN THERE ARE SIDEWALKS. SO I JUST HAVE MAJOR RESERVATIONS, ESPECIALLY ABOUT DECREASING SAFETY IN MANY AREAS AND ESPECIALLY FOR SCHOOL CHILDREN. THANK YOU.
00:43:31.846: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER SONG?
00:43:33.848: >> Councilmember Song: I CHECKED IN WITH ANN ARBOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS TRANSPORTATION OR SAFETY COMMITTEE. WHEN THIS LAST CAME UP FOR A VOTE, THEY WAS EXCITED TO SEE THIS TO SUPPORT THEIR SUMMER PROGRAMS. A REMINDER THAT KIDS 12 AND UNDER CANNOT GET VACCINATIONS UNTIL LATER THIS FALL. WHEN SPEAKING WITH THE SCHOOLS AND THE FAMILIES, THEY ARE HOPING THIS WOULD BE A SAFE WAY TO HAVE SOME EXTRA SPACE BEYOND THE PARKS FOR KIDS TO SEE SCHOOL FRIENDS AND A SAFE ENVIRONMENT. SO JUST REMINDER AND HOPEFULLY, YOU KNOW, FOLKS CAN ALSO REACH OUT TO THE SCHOOLS AND HAVE THE SAME CONVERSATION. THANKS.
00:44:22.831: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
00:44:23.865: >> Councilmember Grand: I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE CAREFUL AROUND THE RHETORIC OF WHAT A NEIGHBORHOOD IS AND WHAT A NEIGHBORHOOD STREET IS. PEOPLE WHO LIVE THROUGHOUT THE CITY DESERVE TO BE SAFE IN THEIR STREETS EVEN IF OTHER PEOPLE WOULD PREFER TO GET THERE FASTER IN THEIR CARS CUTTING THROUGH. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE AND PART OF WHAT IS EXCELLENT ABOUT THIS PROGRAM IS IT'S DRIVEN BY THE PEOPLE WHO DO LIVE ON THOSE STREETS AND PROUD TO CALL THOSE AREAS THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS EVEN IF IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE YOURS.
00:45:02.604: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
00:45:03.471: >> Councilmember Nelson: THANK YOU. I HAVE IT PRINTED OUT IN FRONT OF ME, AND SO I THOUGHT IT WAS WORTH SHARING THAT WASHTENAW COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT IS LIFTING ITS MASK AND GATHERING ORDERS FOR K-12 SCHOOL CHILDREN. I THINK IS IMPORTANT INFORMATION. AND ALSO THE THING I LOST MY TRAIN OF THOUGHT ON. IT WAS ONLY A FEW MEETINGS AGO THAT WE HAD DEVELOPMENT WHERE THERE WAS NEIGHBORHOOD OPPOSITION. AND THERE WAS SUPPORT AT THIS TABLE FOR CONNECTIVITY AND THE VALUE OF THAT. AND I GUESS IS SEEMS LIKE WE ARE AT CROSS PURPOSES WHEN WE DECIDE THAT IT'S OKAY TO CHOKE OFF 34 STREETS FOR THE BENEFIT OF PEOPLE WHO LIVE ON THOSE 34 STREETS AND BASICALLY TAKE AWAY THAT CONNECTIVITY. THAT WAS POINT I MEANT TO MAKE EARLIER. THANK YOU.
00:45:57.659: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? I WILL BE VOTING IN FAVOR OF THIS, AS WE ARE VOTING FOR MEASURES TO MAKE SURE THAT STREETS ARE SAFE FOR ALL USERS AND SAFE FOR PEDESTRIANS, CYCLISTS AND DRIVERS. THAT'S HEALTHY STREETS GOAL AND I BELIEVE HEALTHY STREETS PROMOTES THAT IN A WAY THAT HAS AI A GREAT BALANCE. FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER EYER. MS.

MOVED AN SECONDED. COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
00:49:13.287: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS SETTLEMENT, BUT I'M DISAPPOINTED THAT AS A PROGRESSIVE CITY OR AS A CITY THAT LIKES TO CONSIDER ITSELF PROGRESSIVE, THAT OUR PHOSPHORUS LEVEL IS HIGHER THAN WHAT MOST PROGRESSIVE CITIES WOULD CONSIDER ACCEPTABLE. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
00:49:39.213: >> THANKS. YEAH, YOU KNOW IT WOULD BE AWESOME IF WE HAD ZERO FOSEROUS AND I AGREE WITH WHAT COUNCIL WOMAN GRISWOLD JUST SAID. I WANTED TO COMMENT ON THIS BECAUSE IT'S AN EXAMPLE OF THE RELATIONSHIPS THAT WE HAVE REGIONAL RELATIONSHIPS AND RESPONSIBILITIES WE HAVE ENVIRONMENTALLY. SO THESE MIDDLE HURON PARTNERS AT DEXTER AND CHELSEA, WE HAVE -- FOR THE PUBLIC WHO DOESN'T KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON HERE, WE ARE BASICALLY BEING ACCUSED OF VIOLATIONS NPDES OF DISCHARGE AT OUR WASTEWATER, BECAUSE THE QUALITY THE ALGAE IN FORD AND BELLEVUE LAKES. I THOUGHT THIS WAS ABYSSENT AGREEMENT THAT WE CAME TO AND I WANTED TO THANK THOSE WOULD GOT US THIS FAR. WHILE I AGREE WE SHOULD BE WORKS AS A GROUP OF REGIONAL COMMUNITIES, WE ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES WHO HAVE CONTROL OF PHOSPHOROUS IN HURON. I THINK IT'S GOOD TO HAVE PRACTICES TO CHANGE, TO IMPROVE TO GET UNDERNEATH THOSE LIMITS AND YOU KNOW, IT ALSO GIVES WASTEWATER TREATMENT TECH TIME TO CATCH UP. ALSO LIKE THE PART WHERE WE MADE THE COMMUNICATION, IF THEY DIDN'T WANT THE LEVELS AT CERTAIN HEIGHTS WE MIGHT NOT HAVE IF THESE WATERWAYS WERE ABLE TO COURSE THEIR NATURAL COURSE. I WANTED TO SUGGEST MY THANKS FOR EVERYBODY WHO WORKED ON THIS AND I HOPE FOR OUR SUPPORT FOR THIS. IT'S BETTER THAN NOTHING AND ACTUALLIES BETTER THAN A LOT -- AND ACTUALLY, IT'S BETTER THAN A LOT OF THINGS. SO THANK YOU.
00:51:24.051: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER DISCH.
00:51:24.952: >> Councilmember Disch: I WANTED TO BRIEFLY SAY THAT THE CITY HAS BEEN STRUGGLING WITH THIS ISSUE WITH EGLE IMPOSING HIGHER RESTRICTIONS ON OUR WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT WITH RESPECT TO PHOSPHOROUS SINCE 1999. AND WHAT HAS HAPPENED HERE THAT IS IMPORTANT IS THAT THERE'S AT LEAST -- WELL, THERE'S -- EGLE IS USING A STRATEGY OF RESTRICTING WHAT WE DISCHARGE AND NOT RECOGNIZING WHAT ACTUALLY IS CAUSING  ALGAE, GREEN-BLUE ALGAE BLOOM IN THE HURON RIVER. AND WHAT IS CAUSING THEM IS RUNOFF FROM FERTILIZER AND LOW FLOW AND THEN THE ALGAE BLOOMS LIKE IF THERE IS A TOB TEMPERATE SHIFT. SO OUR WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT IS NOT THE PROBLEM. THE PROBLEM IS WHAT IS CALLED MIXING. AND I WON'T TRY TO EXPLAIN IT, BECAUSE THOUGH I FEEL I UNDERSTAND, IT I DON'T FEEL I UNDERSTAND IT WELL ENOUGH TO. PLAIN IT. WHAT IS AT STAKE IS NOT WHAT WE ARE DOING BUT WHAT EGLE DOESN'T RECOGNIZE WHAT IT TAKES TO CONTROL AN ECOSYSTEM. SO I AGREE THAT THIS IS A GOOD SETTLEMENT, BUT I DON'T WANT ANYONE TO THINK THAT WE ARE SOMEHOW MISMANAGING OUR WATER DISCHARGE, BECAUSE WE ARE NOT.

00:54:19.960: >> City Admin. Crawford: MAYOR, I MAY BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THAT. MS. PRACTICE CHAN MAY BE ABLE TO ASSIST AS WELL, BUT THIS IS MONEY THAT I BELIEVE WILL BE USED PART -- IN PART ON THAT CYCLE TRACK PORTION ON DIVISION.

00:54:52.760: >> Mayor Taylor: YOU ARE ON MUTE.
00:54:55.229: >> City Admin. Crawford: I SAID, YES IT WAS RELATED TO CYCLE TRACK BEING AMONG OTHER THINGS AND IT'S MAKING UP FOR SOME BOND PROCEEDS THAT NEEDED TO BE EXPENDED.

00:56:50.044: >> Councilmember Disch: AS COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER SAID, WE HAD A CONVERSATION WITH AAPD TODAY. WE BOTH AGREED THAT WE WANTED TO ADDRESS SOME CONCERNS THAT RESIDENTS HAVE RAISED AND I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THREE THINGS AND THEY ARE THAT WE ALREADY -- AAPS ALREADY HAS THIS TECHNOLOGY. AND THEY ARE USING IT AS FAR AS -- THEIR ANNUAL USE OF FORCE REPORT SUGGESTS THAT THEY ARE USING IT SAFELY, THAT MUCH OF TIME WHEN TASERS ARE IN PLAY IN AN ENCOUNTER, THEY ARE DISPLAYED RATHER THAN DEPLOYED OR DISCHARGED AND THIS IS AN UPGREAT THAT WILL PROVIDE BETTER SAFETY AND BETTER TRANSPARENCY AND I WILL LET COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER ELABORATE ON THOSE POINTS.
00:57:44.098: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND?
00:57:48.469: >> Councilmember Hayner:  A SEE CHIEF COME IS HERE. WE ALWAYS HAVE A GOOD TIME AND WE ALWAYS LEARN SOMETHING. YES, I GUESS THE THING I WANTED TO SAY IS IT CAME OUT AT OUR MEETING THAT WE HAD A COUPLE OF FOLKS EMAIL US AND SAY, WELL, YOU KNOW, ARMING THE PLACE, TASERS AND SO ON AND AS COUNCILMEMBER DISCH POINTED OUT, THIS IS AN UPDATE TO A SYSTEM WE ALREADY HAVE IN PLACE. IT'S AN UPDATE THAT ALLOWS THE POLICE CAMERA SYSTEM, THE BODY CAM SYSTEM TO BE AUTOMATICALLY ACTIVATED WHEN THE TASER IS DEPLOYED OR UNHOLSTERRED AND DEPLOYMENT IS WHEN IT'S ACTUALLY USED. AND ALSO IN THAT CASE. BUT I THINK IT'S A GOOD THING FOR TRANSPARENCY AND RECORD KEEPING AND IT'S A NECESSARY POLICE TOOL. LIKE THE TRUTH IS THERE ARE TIMES IN OUR SOCIETY IN DEALING WITH THE PUBLIC WHERE THERE ARE REASONABLE USES OF FORCE NECESSARY. THE POLICE HAVE AND FOLLOW AN ESCALATION OF FORCE PROTOCOL. AND THIS IS REALLY A STEP BETWEEN -- I WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVE AN OFFICER UNHOLSTER AND USE A TR TASER RATHER THAN A FIREARM. I THINK IT'S A DEESCALATION IT NOT BEING IN PLACE. ONE THING DID I FIND INTERESTING IN YOU LOOK AT THE P.O., JUST FROM MY -- THEY DON'T ACTUALLY CHARGE US FOR THE TASER. THEY PROVIDE THE TASERS AND THE DEVICES AND THEY CHARGE US FOR THE SERVICE TO USE THEM. I THOUGHT THAT WAS AN INTERESTING MODEL, A CONTEMPORARY MEL BUT IT COMES WITH A WARRANTY THAT THEY ALL WORK AND FUNCTION PROPERLY. I'M SORRY THAT WE LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE THESE TOOLS ARE NECESSARY. BUT IT SEEMS THAT THEY ARE. SO I WILL SUPPORT THIS.
00:59:35.976: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
00:59:37.144: >> Councilmember Griswold: THIS IS A QUESTION FOR THE CHIEF. BUT BACKGROUND. I WAS TOTALLY APPALLED THAT SOME OF OUR POLICE OFFICERS DIDN'T HAVE FUNCTIONING BODY CAMS AND OTHERS WERE USING OLD TECHNOLOGY. SO GIVEN THAT COMMUNITY MEMBERS HAVE CELL PHONES WITH CAMERAS, I THINK IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE GET THE PERSPECTIVE FROM THE POLICE OFFICER AS WELL AS FROM COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND I WOULD LIKE THE POLICE CHIEF TO SPEAK ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS, IF IT IS A WILL ALL THEOLICE OFFICERS HAVE THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY IN TERMS OF BODY CAMS SER IS REMOVED FROM THEHE HOLSTER.
01:00:34.535: >> YES, IT'S STERN CERTAINLY THE LATEST THAT WE KNOW ABOUT, BUT TECHNOLOGY CHANGES QUICKLY. THE TASERS ARE NOW YELLOW. IT'S A SAFETY FEATURE. OUR OLDER TASERS WERE BLACK PRIOR TO THIS. SO THE HIGH VISIBILITY YELLOW, YOU KNOW, IT LIMITS THE MISTAKES AND THE FACT THAT THEY ARE SYNCED TO EVERY TIME YOU DEPLOY A TASER, YOU TAKE IT OUT OF THE HOLSTER, THE CAMERA WILL COME ON NO MATTER WHAT. THEY ARE LINKED TOGETHER. SO TRANSPARENCYWISE IT GOES A LONG WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE VERY TRAPARENT ABOUT THE USE OF IT. AS FAR AS THE NUMBER. WE HAVE TASERS BUT WE DON'T USE THEM VERY MUCH. I THINK IN ALL OF 2020. WE DEPLOYED IT TWICE AND THE YEAR BEFORE THAT, WE DEPLOYED IT FOUR TIMES. SO EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE THESE WEAPONS, ITS NOT SOMETHING THAT THE -- THE LESS LETHAL DEVICES, IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE USE FREQUENTLY AND DEESCALATION AND ALL THE THINGS AROUND THAT ARE OUR PRIMARY SOURCE OF WHAT WE TRY TO USE BEFORE WE EVEN USE THIS. SO HOPEFULLY THIS ANSWERS YOUR QUESTIONS.
01:01:55.282: >> Councilmember Griswold: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
01:01:56.350: >> YOU'RE WELCOME.
01:01:58.385: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. PUBLIC HEARINGS. WE NOW COME TO ONE PUBLIC HEARING.

MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER RADINA AND SECONDED BY DISCH. DISCUSSION OF B-1. COUNCILMEMBER RADINA.
01:04:53.427: >> Councilmember Radina: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I CAN BE REALLY BRIEF SINCE WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE. I WANTED TO USE THIS AS ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO THANK THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO PROVIDED INPUT ON THIS, THE MEMBERS OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION AND MY COSPONSORS BUT ALSO TO USE THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO CALL ON THE STATE LEGISLATURE TO PASS THE CROWN ACT STATEWIDE SO THAT WE DON'T CONTINUE TO HAVE TO HAVE CIVIL RIGHTS PROTECTIONS IN PLACE, PIECEMEAL BY PROGRESSIVE CITIES THAT ARE WILLING TO LEAD. SO I HOPE THAT THE STATE WILL FOLLOW OUR LEAD ON THIS AND WILL PASS THIS STATEWIDE. BUT THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR SUPPORT.
01:05:32.265: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. C-1. AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND CHAPTER 8 (ORGANIZATION OF BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS), SECTIONS 1:214 AND 1:215, TITLE I OF THE CODE OF THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR TO AMEND COMMISSION APPOINTMENT PROCESS, ADD EXCEPTIONS TO ALLOW EARLIER REVIEW OF INCIDENTS IN LIMITED CASES, AND INCREASE NUMBER OF INFORMATION MANAGERS. ALL ALL TO THE INDEPENDENT COMMUNITY POLICE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION. MOVED BY NELSON AND SECONDED BY RAMLAWI.
01:06:12.305: >> Counc COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:06:15.742: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU TO COUNCILMEMBER NELSON AND THE CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE TO DISCUSS THESE ISSUES. THERE ARE THREE CHANGES THAT ARE BEING PROPOSED WITH THE SUPPORT OF ICPOC. ONE IS TO INCREASE THE INFORMATION MANAGERS TO ALLOW THEM MORE FLEXIBILITY AND ESSENTIALLY A BOOKKEEPER WITH THOSE INVESTIGATIONS AND INCREASING THE INFORMATION MANAGERS FROM FIVE FROM WHAT NOW READS THREE IN THE ORDINANCE. SECOND, WOULD BE TO HAVE THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE COMMISSION TO ANY OF THE NOMINEES THAT WE VOTE ON, TO BE APPOINTED TO THE -- TO ICPOC SO THAT THEY HAVE A VOICE AND WHO SIT ON THE COMMISSION SO THAT THEY CAN HAVE THE PEOPLE THAT BEST FITS THEIR NEEDS WHEN THOSE NEEDS ARISE IF THEY ARE CHANGING. SO THIS, AGAIN, WOULD STILL THE NAMES WOULD BE PUT FORTH BY THE FOUR COUNCILMEMBERS WHO ARE TASKED WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY NOW, BUT WE WOULD ALSO HAVE TO HAVE THE RECOMMENDATION, THE BLESSINGS OF THE COMMISSION FOR THOSE NAMES. AND LASTLY, THIS IS A CHANGE TO THE INVESTIGATIVE POWERS OF THE COMMISSION. AND CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS TO BEGIN LOOKING INTO MATTERS BEFORE ALL THE APPEALS PROCESSES AND DUE PROCESS ARE EXHAUSTED. SO THIS IS AS A RESULT OF THE WIMBERLY INCIDENT AND ALLOWING THE COMMISSION BEGIN WORK WHILE THERE'S STILL ONGOING APPEALS REGARDING SOME OF THE DECISION THAT CAME OUT OF THAT SO I LOOK FORWARD TO THE BODY HOPEFULLY SUPPORTING THIS AND ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT PEOPLE MAY HAVE. BUT PERHAPS THERE'S OTHER PEOPLE ON THE CALL THAT CAN ANSWER THEM BETTER THAN I CAN EVEN.
01:08:33.113: >> City Admin. Crawford: MAYOR, I FORGOT TO MENTION THAT WE HAVE DR. JACKSON HERE ALSO WHO -- WHO IS AVAILABLE TO MACK A FEW MAKEW COMMENTS ON. THIS SHE AND I HAD WORKED ON THIS TO START WITH.
01:08:48.028: >> Mayor Taylor: AH. WITH COUNCIL'S ACQUIESCENCE. DR. JACKSON?
01:08:56.770: >> THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME. I KNOW THIS IS NOT WHERE I'M USUALLY TALKING TO COUNCIL BUT I DID WANT TO TALK JUST REALLY BRIEFLY ABOUT THIS WITH YOU GUYS AS MENTIONED, BEFORE I'M LISA JACKSON, THE CHAIR OF THE INDEPENDENT COMMUNITY POLICE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION. SO THANK YOU, CITY ADMINISTRATOR CRAWFORD FOR ADDING ME TO THE AGENDA AND THANK YOU TO COUNCIL FOR CONSIDERING CHANGES TO THE ORDINANCE THAT GOVERNS OUR WORK. I JUST WANTED TO BRIEFLY EXPLAIN OUR POSITION ON THESE THREE POTENTIAL CHANGES. SO FIRST, THE NOMINATION PROCESS. INITIALLY COMMISSIONERS WERE APPOINTED THROUGH A PROCESS WHERE THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION REVIEWED APPLICATIONS AND MADE SUGGESTIONS TO A TEAM OF COUNCILMEMBERS. AND UNFORTUNATELY, I THINK IT WAS JUST A TYPO PROBABLY, THE ORDINANCE SUGGESTED THAT FUTURE COMMISSIONERS, ONE ONCE WE WERE ALL SEATED SHOULD BE APPOINTED BY THE SAME PROCESS AND THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION SAYS THEY DON'T WANT TO BE INVOLVED IN THAT PROCESS AND NOR WOULD THAT BE APPROPRIATE. SO WE REQUESTED THAT WE WILL READ APPLICATIONS THAT INTERVIEW CANDIDATES AND MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT DEMOGRAPHICS MIGHT BEST FIT US DO. WE NEED AN UNDOCUMENTED PERSON, FOR EXAMPLE? DO WE NEED A FORMERLY INCARCERATED PERSON, A PERSON WHO IS OR HAS BEEN UNHOUSED. WE ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW MANY HOURS CAN A PERSON CONTRIBUTE TO THE WORK? CAN THEY GO THROUGH THE RIGOROUS TRAINING REQUIRED TO DO GOOD OVERSIGHT. THESE ARE THING IT'S THAT WE CONSIDER. WE KNOW THAT THE ORDINANCE ALSO SAYS ACTUALLY THAT PEOPLE NEED NOT FILL OUT AN APPLICATION, AND WE WANT TO STRONGLY SORT OF DISAGREE WITH THAT POINT. WE THINK APPLICATIONS DO NEED TO ARTICULATE THEIR INTENT, THEIR EXPECTED CONTRIBUTIONS, HOW MUCH TIME THEY CAN COMMIT AND HOW THEY PERCEIVE A POLICE OVERSIGHT. SO THE COMMISSION AFTER UNDERGOING THIS RIGOROUS PROCESS WOULD LIKE TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE FOUR LIAISON TWO FROM HRC AND TWO FROM ICPOC WHO COULD THEN EVALUATE OUR RECOMMENDATIONS, EVALUATE THAT CRITERIA AND DECIDE WHETHER TO TAKE THE NAMES FORWARD TO THE FULL COUNCIL FOR A VOTE. MOST IMPORTANTLY, THOUGH, OUR COMMISSION IS INDEPENDENT, WHICH DIFFERS FROM OVER CITY COMMISSIONS. THIS COMMISSION WAS STARTED IN LARGE PART BY A DEMAND FROM THE COMMUNITY AND WE WANTED TO BE AS FREE FROM POLITICAL INFLUENCE AS POSSIBLE. THAT IS NECESSARY FOR THE COMMISSION TO RETAIN ITS INDEPENDENT AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO LIVE UP TO THE SPIRIT OF THE CREATION OF THIS COMMISSION. THE SECOND THING IS INFORMATION MANAGERS. SO THE ORDINANCE PROVIDES FOR UP TO THREE INFORMATION MANAGERS AND WE WOULD LIKE TO EXPAND THAT TO FIVE AND I WOULD JUST LIKE TO EXPLAIN WHY. INFORMATION MANAGERS ARE COMMISSIONERS WHO HAVE EXTRA TRAINING IN COMPLAINT REVIEW AND SO PRIOR TO A COMPLAINT REVIEW MEETING, WHAT HAPPENS IS THE POLICE RELEASE INFORMATION, LIKE BODY CAM VIDEO OR INTERNAL DOCUMENTS TO THE INFORMATION MANAGERS ASSIGNED TO A CASE. THOSE THREE INDIVIDUALS THEN SHOW UP AFTER HAVING REVIEWED THAT INFORMATION. THEY SHOW UP AT A MEETING WITH POLICE LEADERSHIP AND PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS AND WE REVIEW DETAILS OF CASE AND ASK QUESTIONS OF THE MISS. I WANT TO GIVE YOU -- OF THE POLICE. I WANTED TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE. IN ONE CASE ONE OF OUR COMMISSIONERS WAS UNABLE TO ATTEND A MEETING AFTER REVIEWING DOCUMENTS AND WE WANTED TO SUBSTITUTE WITH ANOTHER INFORMATION MANAGER BUT THAT WOULD HAVE MEANT THAT FOUR PEOPLE WOULD HAVE SEEN THE DOCUMENTATION, AND THAT WAS IN VIOLATION OTHE ORDINANCE. SO IN THAT CASE, WE HAD TO WORK WITH JUST TWO COMMISSIONERS INSTEAD OF THREE. THERE HAVE BEEN A COUPLE OF OTHER CASES WHERE WE NEEDED THE EXPERTISE OF A SPECIFIC COMMISSIONER WASN'TED TO ADD -- WANTED TO ADD THEM OR HAVE THEM REVIEW THE DOCUMENTS AND WE WEREN'T ABLE TO DO THAT. IT WAS ALSO BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION THAT AN INFORMATION MANAGER MIGHT FIND AFTER REVIING THE DOCENTS THAT HE OR SHE MIGHT KNOW OF A COMPLAINT OR WOU NEED T RECUS H OR HERSELF FROM REVIEWING THAT CASE FOR WHATEVER REASON AND THUS HAVING A FOURTH PERSON TO BE ABLE TO SEE THE INFORMATION WOULD BE NECESSARY, EVEN THOUGH THERE WOULD STILL ONLY BE THREE COMMISSIONERS INVOLVED IN THE COMPLAINT REVIEW MEETING. SO THIS IS REALLY ABOUT ACCESS TO INFORMATION. THE FIFTH INFORMATION MANAGER WOULD LIKELY NEVER ATTEND THE POLICE MEETINGS BUT WE NEED ONE PERSON WHO TRACKS ALL THE CASES. THERE' THREE COMMISSIONERS ON ONE CASE OR A DIFFERENT COMBINATION OF THREE COMMISSIONERS ON ANOTHER CASE AND WE NEED ONE PERSON WITH ACCESS TO ALL DATA WHO CAN START TO PAY ATTENTION TO FRIENDS AND PATTERN AND PRACTICE. AND SO IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE POLICE HAVE SORT OF MADE A COMPLAINT THAT FIVE INFORMATION MANAGERS IS TOO UNWIELDY. THE PROCESS ON THEIR END WOULD LIKELY NOT CHANGE AT ALL. THEY WOULD STILL WORK WITH THREE COMMISSIONERS AS THEY HAVE BEEN. WE NEED THE FOURTH IN CASE OF SOMETHING LIKE A CONFLICT OF INTEREST OR AN UNEXPECTED AVAILABILITY, BUT THERE WOULD BE MORE PEOPLE WHO HAVE ACTRESS TO- ACCESS TO THE INFORMATION. AND THEN THE THIRD THING THAT I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE CONSIDERING IS THE EARLY REVIEW OF INCIDENTS. AND SO I WANT TO BRING UP THAT THIS IS NOT AN ISSUE THAT WE ASKED FOR. WE DIDN'T COME FORWARD AND ASK THE ORDINANCE BE CHANGED IN THIS WAY. IT WAS BROUGHT TO US BY CITY MANAGER C CRAWFORD IN RESPONSE O THE WIMBERLY. WHERE THE POLICE BROKE INTO THE WRONG HOUSE IN RESPONSE TO A 911 CALL. OUR PROCESS HAS ALWAYS BEEN TO REVIEW POLICE CASES AFTER POLICE WERE FINISHED BAZ THAT'S THE WAY THE ORDINANCE WAS -- BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY THE ORDINANCE HAS BEEN WRITTEN AND THAT'S THE WAY WE WORKED. HOWEVER, CITY ADMINISTRATOR CRAWFORD SUGGESTED THAT WE NEEDED TO BE ABLE TO REVIEW THIS CASE BEFORE THE POLICE PROCESS WAS FINISHED. IT'S STILL NOT QUITE FINISHED AND IT MAY TAKE SOME TIME. WE DON'T KNOW HOW LONG THAT'S GOING TO BE. WE WERE A LITTLE BIT PERPLEXED AT THAT BECAUSE THIS GOES AGAINST THE WAY WE HAVE BEEN WORKING SINCE OUR INCEPTION. WE ARE NOT NECESSARILY OPPOSED TO IT AND ON ONE HAND THIS KIND OF SEEMS SIMILAR TO WHAT THE TASK FORCE ASKED FOR, BUT IT'S NOT EXACTLY THE SAME THING. IT DOESN'T ALLOW US TO WORK IN PARALLEL WITH POLICE INVESTIGATIONS TYPICALLY, ONLY IN SPECIFIC CASES AND ONLY WITH THE POLICE CHIEF'S PERMISSION. WE SEE SOME POTENTIAL PROBLEMS. MAYBE SOME THINGS THAT YOU COULD SORT OF WORK THROUGH AS YOU CONSIDER CHANGING THE ORDINANCE. SO FOR EXAMPLE, IF WE WERE TO DISCUSS IN A REPORT THE POTENTIAL DISCIPLINE OF AN OFFICER BUT IF THE OFFICER WERE TO GO THROUGH AN APPEALS PROCESS AND HAVE THAT DISCIPLINE REMOVED, WHAT IT MEANS IN EFFECT IS THAT IT ACTUALLY NEVER HAPPENED TO THEM. THEN I'M QUITE SURE THAT THE UNION WOULD FILE A GRIEVANCE AGAINST US BECAUSE WE DISCUSSED A DISCIPLINE THAT DOESN'T EXIST ANYMORE. WE ARE FINE WITH INVESTIGATING IN PARALLEL OR TANDEM OR SLIGHTLY BEHIND BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE WERE NO ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES TO US. SO WE WOULD LIKE TO BE IMMUNE FROM THAT KIND OF GRIEVANCE FROM THE UNION. WE WOULD LIKE TO UNDERSTAND WHEN THIS EARLY REVIEW PROCESS COULD BE ENACTED. IS IT A PROCESS THAT CAN BE REQUESTED BY US ARE DOES EARLY REVIEW ONLY HAPPEN WHEN REQUESTED BY THE CITY OR BY THE POLICE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. SO CLARIFICATION IN THAT WAY AS YOU GUYS MULL THIS OVER WOULD BE APPRECIATED. AND SO I JUST WANTED TO KIND OF BRING THOSE POINTED POINTS FORWD WE APPRECIATE YOUR REVIEW AND POTENTIAL REVISIONS TO THE ORDINANCE. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
01:16:17.010: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
01:16:23.082: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I WANTED TO QUICKLY SAY, I WAS PLEASED TO SEE AN ITEM LIKE THIS ON OUR AGENDA. THIS IS WHAT I ENVISIONED WHEN ICPOC WAS SEATED, AND HOW THE ORDINANCE COULD BE ADOPTED TO MEET THEIR NEEDS AND I'M PARTICULARLY PLEASED TO SEE THE TERMS AROUND APPOINTMENTS BECAUSE I HAVE -- I HAVE SAID FOR A LONG TIME THAT I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS THE KIND OF PROCESS THAT SHOULD EXIST FOR ALL OF OUR BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS. I'M GLAD TO SEE ICPOC HAVE THIS SORT OF EMPOWERMENT. IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR THE SPECIAL KIND OF COMMISSION THAT THEY ARE BUT I THINK IT'S JUST A GOOD THING GENERALLY. THANKS.
01:17:07.293: >> Councilmember Briggs: COUNCIL MEMBER BRIGGS. THANK YOU AND I REALLY APPRECIATE DR. JACKSON PROVIDING THAT BACKGROUND. IT ANSWERED A LOT OF QUESTIONS AND I WILL CONTINUE TO REHAB THEM BEFORE IT COMES TO US FOR A SECOND READING. I DO HAVE A FEW CONCERNS OF HAVING THE RECOMMENDATION FROM THE COMMISSION. I THINK IT'S -- I CAN -- DR. JACKSON'S EXPLANATION HELPS EXPLAIN HOW THAT WOULD BENEFICIAL IN TERMS OF PUTTING FORWARD DIFFERENT VOICES THAT ARE REALLY NEEDED ON THE COMMISSION AND I DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY CONCERNS ABOUT THAT AS THE COMMISSION OPERATES RIGHT NOW. I JUST DOWN THE LINE COULD IMAGINE THAT THIS COULD LEAD TO ODD SITUATIONS EVEN THOUGH ICPOC OPERATES DIFFERENTLY THAN SOME OF OUR OTHER COMMI COMMISSIONS. IT SEEM HIS LIKE THIS COULD BE A LITTLE UNUSUAL OF THE COMMISSION MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS. I NEED TO THINK THROUGH MORE INFORMATION ON IT BEFORE IT COMES BACK TO US.
01:18:17.029: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RADINA.
01:18:18.531: >> Councilmember Radina: THANKS, MR. MAYOR AND TO COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS' COMMENTS, THERE IS ACTUALLY EXACTLY WHAT RAMLAWI, NELSON AND I MET WITH STAFF ABOUT EARLIER THIS WEEK, AND I THINK WE WANTED TO GET SOME CLARITY AND WE CHANGED THE LANGUAGE A LITTLE BIT AS WELL TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WAS CLEAR. I THINK THE INTENTION HERE IS TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE -- THAT ICPOC ACTS DIFFERENTLY AS YOU NOTED FROM THE REST OF OUR COMMISSIONS BUT ALSO TO ALLOW THEM TO MAINTAIN SOME OF THAT INDEPENDENCE AND TO ENSURE THAT THIS COUNCIL OR THE FUTURE COUNCILS ARE NOT DRAMATICALLY CHANGING THE NATURE OF THE COMMISSION THROUGH THE APPOINTMENT PROCESS BUT RATHER THAT THE COMMISSION MAINTAINS ITS INDEPENDENCE IN A WAY THAT WE STILL PLAY OUR ROLE. IT DOESN'T COMPEL US AS COUNCILMEMBERS TO APPOINT INDIVIDUALS THAT COME WITH A RECOMMENDATION OF ICPOC, BUT IT DOES -- IT DOES REQUIRE THAT THERE IS SOME COLLABORATION AND PARTNERSHIP THERE IN MOVING A NOMINATION FORWARD.
01:19:23.629: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION?
01:19:25.531: >> City Admin. Crawford: MAYOR, IF COY JUST ADD. SO AS YOU ALL HAVE QUESTIONS ON THIS BETWEEN NOW AND THE MEETING, I'M HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU ON THOSE. IN RELATION TO THE LAST MATTER, THE ITEM THAT STAFF BROUGHT FORWARD TO ICPOC, YOU KNOW, WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS REALLY A SITUATION THAT MAY TAKE SOME TIME TO FINISH ALL THE INTERNAL REVIEWS AND WORK AND AN EFFORT TO ALLOW THE COMMISSION TO START ITS WORK AND WORK ON THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN COMPLETED IS WHERE THAT CHANGE COMES INTO PLAY. IT'S NOT AN INTENTION TO HAVE NEXT IN FRONT OF OR WITH THE OTHER REVIEWS BUT ALSO NOT WAIT ON THE WHOLE THING TO BE DONE BEFORE THEY GET ACCESS TO ANYTHING. BUT HAPPY TO CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS WITH THAT AND ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS AS YOU MOVE FORWARD.
01:20:20.887: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. DS-1. RESOLUTION TO AWARD A CONTRACT TO MANPOWER, INC. OF SOUTHEASTERN MICHIGAN FOR TEMPORARY STAFFING SERVICES FOR PUBLIC WORKS. MOVED BY A RADINA AND SECONDED Y DISCH. COUNCILMEMBER RADINA.
01:20:44.277: >> Councilmember Radina: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR BEFORE. WE GET TOO FAR DOWN THIS PROCESS, I HAVE SUBMITTED AND AMENDMENT TO THE CLERK, IF YOU COULD PLEASE CIRCULATE THAT AROUND. MY AMENDMENT WOULD ALTER THE CONTRACT TO REDUCE THE PERIOD OF TIME FROM THREE YEARS TO ONE YEAR. AND ELSE THE OPTION TO RENEW FOR TWO ADDITIONAL YEARS.
01:21:09.869: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THAT CIRCULATED YET? IS THERE A SECOND? SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER SONG. COUNCILMEMBER RADINA, YOU STILL HAVE THE FLOOR.
01:21:22.148: >> Councilmember Radina: THANKS. THIS IS COMING -- I WANT TO THANK A NUMBER OF COUNCILMEMBERS WHO HAVE SPOKE WITH. COUNCILMEMBER EYER, BRIGGS, NELSON AND DISCH, WHO I HAVE SPOKEN WITH, AS WELL AS SOME MEMBERS FROM THE LABOR COMMUNITY AROUND THIS TOPIC BUT IN PARTICULAR, I THINK THAT SOME OF THIS RELATES BACK TO STANDING COUNCIL POLICY AROUND STILLING POSITIONS THAT -- ESSENTIALLY NOT FILLING POSITIONS THAT PROBABLY SHOULD BE PERMANENT WITH TEMPORARY EMPLOYEES AND LOOKING AROUND THE DETAILS OF THIS CONTRACT AND THE FACT THAT THESE EMPLOYEES ARE FILLING ESSENTIALLY NINE-MONTH TERMS FOR CONSECUTIVE YEARS AND ALSO RECOGNIZING THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT SOME POTENTIAL CHANGES TO NOT ONLY OUR COMPOSTING BUT ALSO SOME OF OUR WINTER MAINTENANCE AND THINGS LIKE THAT, THAT I THINK A SHORTER TERM CONTRACT IS PROBABLY MORE APPROPRIATE AS WE CONTINUE TO WORK OUT THOSE DETAILS AND DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THERE WILL ULTIMATELY BE CHANGES TO THE FULL-TIME EMPLOYEE MAKEUP IN THE FUTURE.
01:22:28.447: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THIS AMENDMENT FRIENDLY TO THE BODY? IS THAT A KNOW COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:22:37.857: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I HAVE QUESTIONS FOR THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR.
01:22:41.293: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER DISCH, I WILL TAKE YOU OFF THE QUEUE, AND YOU CAN COME BACK IN ON THE MAIN MOTION, UNLESS YOU WANT TO SPEAK ON THE AMENDMENT. YOU WERE PRIOR. SO --
01:22:53.839: >> Councilmember Disch: CORRECT, I DID WANT TO SPEAK ON THE AMENDMENT. NOT A PROBLEM. LET COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI ASK HIS QUESTIONS AND THEN I WILL POP IN.
01:23:05.084: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. MR. CRAWFORD AND THE STAFF, WOULD THIS HAVE ANY NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON YOUR ABILITY TO DO WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE WITH THIS RESOLUTION AND WHAT IS BEING ASKED FOR. I WOULD ASSUME NOT. I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY KIND  OF UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES.
01:23:32.511: >> Mayor Taylor: WE HAVE MS. MAJEWSKI.
01:23:35.681: >> WILL THERE BE DIRECT OPERATIONAL IMPACTS FOR THE AMENDMENT THAT'S ON THE FLOOR?
01:23:38.884: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THAT'S RIGHT.
01:23:47.059: >> Counc YES, GOING FROM THE THREE YEAR TO THE ONE YEAR.
01:23:51.864: >> THERE IS NOT AN IMPACT.
01:23:52.865: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. IT'S FRIENDLY, MAYOR. NO OBJECTION.
01:23:56.769: >> Mayor Taylor: ALL RIGHT. THE AMENDMENT IS FRIENDLY. COUNCILMEMBER DISCH.
01:24:01.207: >> Councilmember Disch: I WOULD LIKE TO VOTE ON THAT AND THEN I WILL SPEAK. I'M JUST --
01:24:04.710: >> Mayor Taylor: IF IT'S FRIENDLY IT DOESN'T REQUIRE A VOTE.
01:24:08.214: >> Councilmember Disch: OH, OKAY. DUH. SORRY.
01:24:10.816: >> Mayor Taylor: THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
01:24:20.459: >> Councilmember Disch: I WANTED TO ASK HOW MANY FULL-TIME EMPLOYEES.
01:24:33.572: >> IT WILL INCREASE TO FOUR AFTER THE BUDGET PASSES.
01:24:36.809: >> Councilmember Disch: AND THEN IT'S TYPICAL, IN ADDITION TO THAT, TO HIRE SIX TEMPS.
01:24:45.484: >> AND THEN IN THE FALL, IT'S TYPICAL TO HAVE HELP WITH LEAF SEASON.
01:24:54.994: >> Councilmember Disch: THANK YOU FOR THAT. I THINK WHAT PROMPTED COUNCIL NOT TO APPROVE THE CONTRACT EXTENSION LAST TIME WAS THAT WE'R REALLY TALNG ABOUT A CRITICAL NEED THAT'S FILLED WITH MORE TEMPORARY EMPLOYEES THAN PERMANENT EMPLOYEES. THE CONCERN IS THAT A TEMPORARY EMPLOYEE COULD BE WORKING FOR NINE MONTHS OUT OF THE YEAR AND YET LOSE EMPLOYMENT FOR THREE MONTHS OUT OF THE YEAR WHICH IS PRECARIOUS. THOUGH EM TEMPORARY EMPLOYEES HD THROUGH THE MANPOWER AGENCY RECEIVE A $16.50 PER HOUR WAGE WHICH IS OVER THE CITY'S MINIMUM OR RATHER LIVING PAG WAGE AND TY DO RECEIVE BENEFITS, THOSE BENEFITS COST THEM $160 A MONTH AND THEY ONLY COVER THE A.C.A. MINIMUM PROVISIONS IF THEY WANT LIFE INSURANCE, DENTAL VISION, ACCIDENT OR CRITICAL ILLNESS INSURANCE, THEY HAVE TO PAY EXTRA FOR THOSE. THE ASCME CONTRACT COVERS EITHER OR BOTH OF THEM, AND $140. IT'S A LOWER DOLLAR A MONTH, AND LOWER PROPORTION OF THE PERSON'S SALARY. THOUGH SHIFTING FROM TEMPORARY TO FULL-TIME WORKERS DO THIS WORK WILL ADD AN EXPENSE TO THE CITY, IT IS NOT TO EXTERNALIZE AND THE BENEFITS FOR THOSE WORKING A HARD JOB. I WILL SUPPORT THIS AMENDMENT AND I HOPE STAFF COME BACK WITH A FULLY STAFFED COMPOST DIVISION. THANK YOU.
01:27:15.034: >> City Admin. Crawford: MAYOR, I FAILED TO MENTION ON THIS ONE THAT THERE WERE SOME QUESTIONS FROM COUNCILMEMBER DISCH. DID YOU HAVE ALL OF YOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED OR DO YOU NEED STAFF TO REVIEW THOSE?
01:27:32.785: >> Councilmember Disch: SO THE FIRST ONE, MS. MACIEJEWSKI DID ADDRESS IT. THE QUESTION ABOUT BENEFITS, IF THERE'S ANY MORE INFORMATION OR IF I STATED ANYTHING INCORRECTLY, I WOULD BE HAPPY TO BE CORRECTED. THERE'S ONE MORE.
01:28:01.914: >> YES, WE COVERED FIRST QUESTION, WHICH IS HOW MANY FULL-TIME EMPLOYEES DO WE HAVE DEDICATED TO COMPOST RIGHT NOW. YOUR SECOND QUESTION WAS THAT YOU NOTICED THAT THERE WAS A FIVEFOLD INCREASE IN CITY HIRED TEMPS IN FISCAL YEAR 2021 VERSUS MANPOWER AND IT FLIPPED IN FISCAL YEAR '20. IT WAS THE EXACT OPPOSITE. YOU WONDERED. WHY AND I CAN SAY WE HONESTLY DON'T KNOW. IT JUST SORT OF EBBS AND FLOWS. WE ACTUALLY -- THE MANPOWER CONTRACT IS AN AS NEEDED CONTRACT. WE FEEL THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEN WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO HIRE DIRECT THROUGH OUR CITY'S H.R., FIRST, BECAUSE SOMETIMES H.R. HAS CANDIDATES AND SOMETIMES DON'T, AND SOMETIMES MANPOWER DOES. THE HOURLY RATE THAT M MANPOWER, THE TEMPORARY PUBLIC WORKS TECHNICIAN WHICH IS AT $19 AN HOUR, BUT OTHER THAN, THAT EVERYTHING YOU STATED WAS CORRECT.
01:29:22.261: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
01:29:24.129: >> Councilmember Griswold: ONE OF THE ITEMS I HEARD FROM THE PUBLIC WAS THE AMOUNT OF DAMAGE TO VEHICLES IN THE STREET. I WONDER IF THERE'S ANY RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TEMPORARY VERSUS PERMANENT STAFF AND THE NUMBER OF INSURANCE CLAIMS WE HAVE.
01:29:39.311: >> THAT WOULD PROBABLY REQUIRE A BIT OF DIGGING TO FIND OUT JUST WHAT THOSE NUMBERS ARE. YES.
01:29:52.458: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I DON'T WANT YOU TO DO ANY EXTRA WORK. I WONDER IF THAT'S OBVIOUS OR JUST BEING OVERSTATED BY CONSTITUENTS.
01:30:02.634: >> YEAH, NO, I HAVEN'T NOTICED.
01:30:04.837: >> Mayor Tay
01:30:07.506: >> City Admin. Crawford: I THINK A LOT OF DAMAGE COMES FROM THE ARMS THAT COME FOR THE PICK UP. YES, THE ARMS THAT DRIVE THAT.
01:30:17.416: >> Councilmember Griswold: OKAY. SO WE WILL BLAME IT ON AN INANIMATE OBJECT, RATHER THAN STAFF.
01:30:25.524: >> City Admin. Crawford: NO, I'M JUST POINTING OUT THAT --
01:30:26.758: >> Councilmember Griswold: I'M AGREEING WITH YOU.
01:30:48.547: >> THERE'S PROBABLY A NUMBER OF REASONS FOR OUR ACCIDENTS.
01:30:53.118: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS.
01:30:54.119: >> Councilmember Briggs: IF THERE'S OPPORTUNITY AS WE ARE THINKING ABOUT HOW TO KEEP THESE PEOPLE OCCUPIED THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE YEAR. I KNOW STAFF IS WORKING ON EXAMINING THE WINTER SIDEWALK MAINTENANCE PROGRAM AND IF THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES TO USE FOLKS FOR THAT PURPOSE, I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THAT. IF NOT, I UNDERSTAND.
01:31:27.553: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR OF THE MOTION AS AMENDED:  OPPOSES. DC, IS RESOLUTION TO APPOINT JAMALL BUFFORD TO THE ANN ARBOR PUBLIC ART COMMISSION. MOVED AND SECONDED. ALL IN FAVOR? OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED WITH 11 COUNCILMEMBERS PRESENT, THUS SATISFYING THE SEVEN MEMBER REQUIRE. DC-2.

MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER NELSON. SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER RADINA. DISCUSSION OF DC-4. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:33:04.449: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. I WANTED TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO THANK STAFF AND THE FOLKS AT RECYCLE ANN ARBOR FROM WORKING TOGETHER AND COMING TO AN AGREEMENT HERE TO HELP US IN A SITUATION WHICH I FIND OURSELVES PROBABLY RACING UP AGAINST THE CLOCK WITH THE EXPIRATION OF THE CURRENT CONTRACT. IT'S NICE TO SEE THAT THIS HAS LED TO MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL RESULTS. SO IT'S GOOD TO SEE US WORKING WITH OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS. I KNOW WHEN I FIRST JOINED COUNCIL, IT WAS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT, AND IT'S GOOD TO SEE THE WORKING RELATIONSHIP NOW IN A MUCH BETTER PLACE. THANK YOU.
01:33:54.633: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. I WILL SAY THAT I'M DELIGHTED TO SEE THIS MOVING FORWARD. FOLKS THROUGHOUT THE CITY ARE COMMITTED TO RECYCLING AND ALSO PROUD OF OUR LOCAL NONPROFIT RECYCLE ANN ARBOR, AND THE RECYCLE ANN ARBOR WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER AT THE MRF AND MOVING US FORWARD IN THE DIRECTION THAT WE WANT TO GO. YEAH. FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. MR. POSTEMA, DO WE HAVE A CLOSED SESSION TODAY?
01:34:45.117: >> City Atty. Postema: YES, WE DO. WE HAVE A CLOSED SESSION INVOLVING THE PURCHASE OF LAND UNDER THE OPEN MEETINGS ACT.
01:34:58.897: >> Mayor Taylor: MAY I HAVE A MOTION TO GO ON CLOSED SESSION ON THAT BASIS. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER NELSON. SECONDED BY GRAND. DISCUSSION, PLEASE? ROLL CALL VOTE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER EYER.
01:35:13.311: >> Councilmember Nelson:  IS COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI GOING TO MAKE A COMMENT?
01:35:16.815: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I WAS GOING TO ASK MS. BEAUDRY, IF YOU CAN SEND THE LINK TO THAT CLOSED SESSION?
01:35:28.393: >> Clerk Beaudry: I CAN RESEND IT. IT'S IN THE ORIGINAL MEETING REQUEST. I REVISED IT WITH THE FULL SESSION LINK, BUT I CAN RESEND IT IN AN EMAIL.
01:35:37.569: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: PLEASE THANK YOU.
01:35:46.311: >> Mayor Taylor: ROLL CALL VOTE, STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER EYER.

01:36:17.242: >> Mayor Taylor: WE ARE IN CLOSED SESSION. SEE YOU ON THE OTHER SIDE. [ CLOSED SESSION ]
01:50:42.672: >> Mayor Taylor: DISCUSSION, ALL IN FAVOR? OPPOSED? BACK IN OPEN SESSION. WE HAVE BEFORE US THE CLERKS REPORT OF COMMUNICATIONS, PETITIONS AND REFERS. MAY I HAVE A MOTION TO APPROVE THE CLERK'S REPORT. MOVED BY DISCH AND SECONDED BY GRISWOLD. DISCUSSION, PLEASE. ALL IN FAVOR? OPPOSED? THE CLERK'S REPORT IS APPROVED. DO WE HAVE COMMUNICATIONS FROM OUR CITY ATTORNEY?
01:51:08.833: >> City Atty. Postema: NO MAYOR, THANK YOU.
01:51:10.501: >> Mayor Taylor: WE NOW COME TO PUBLIC COMMENT GENERAL TIME. IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MEMBERS OF PUBLIC TO SPEAK AT COUNCIL ABOUT MATTERS OF MUNICIPAL INTEREST. TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT GENERAL TIME, ONE NEED NOT HAVE SIGNED UP IN ADVANCE. PLEASE ENTER THE NUMBER ON YOUR SCREEN. 877-853-5247. ONCE HAVE YOU BEEN CONNECTED, PLEASE ENTER MEETING I. I.D.94212372148. 94212732148. ONCE YOU ARE CONNECTED, PLEASE FURTHER ENTER STAR NINE. STAR TO INDICATE THAT YOU WISH TO SPEAK. WHEN IS IT YOUR TURN TO SPEAK, THE CLERK WILL IDENTIFY YOU BY LAST THREE DIGITS OF YOUR TELEPHONE NUMBER. YOU WILL HAVE THREE MINUTES IN WHICH TO SPEAK. SO PLEASE PAY CLOSE TO ATTENTION TO THE TIME. OUR CLERK WILL NOTIFY YOU WHEN 30 SECONDS ARE REMAINING. WHEN YOUR TIME IS EXPIRED, PLEASE CONCLUDE YOUR REMARKS AND CEDE THE FLOOR S. THERE ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT?
01:52:25.142: >> Clerk Beaudry: MAYOR, I DON'T SEE ANYBODY WITH THEIR HAND.
01:52:36.821: >> Mayor Taylor: SEEING NO, ONE, PUBLIC COMMENT IS CLOSED. IS THERE COMMUNICATION FROM COUNCIL? COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS?
01:52:43.561: >> Councilmember Briggs: THANK YOU. I WANTED TO DRAW FOLKS' ATTENTION TO A COUPLE OF THINGS ON THE AGENDA. ONE WAS E-1, THE MICHIGAN DRIVE SAFE BILL. THIS IS A RECOMMENDATION FROM THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION. I WILL MAKE A NOTE THAT I WILL BRING THAT FORWARD AS A RESOLUTION FOR COUNCIL TO CONSIDER SUPPORTING AS WELL, HOPEFULLY AT OUR NEXT MEETING. AND THEN I DIDN'T COMMENT ON THIS EARLIER, BUT FOR CA-20, THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT, I WANTED TO PUBLIC STATE I APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK THAT STAFF DID COMING TO THE CONCESSIONS THAT WE HAVE AND THE IMPROVEMENTS IN THAT. I HOPE THE NEXT TIME AROUND WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO MAKE A LITTLE BIT MORE PROGRESS ON ARTICLE 5, SECTION 3, WHICH DEALS WITH DISCIPLINE. THERE'S A PIECE IN THERE AND I THINK CONSTITUENTS FOR DRAWING MY ATTENTION TO THIS. IT SAYS THAT DISCIPLINARY RECOMMENDATIONS SHALL NOT BE BASED ON INFRACTIONS WHICH HAVE OCCURRED MORE THAN 24 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT CURRENTLY UNDER INVESTIGATION. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I WOULD HOPE THAT WE WOULD MOVE AWAY FROM IN THE FUTURE, PARTICULARLY THESE ARE LEADERSHIP POSITIONS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT HERE. I THINK THE BEST EXAMPLE OF EXAMPLE THATFOLKS CAN BE DEMONSS THAT WE CAN -- WE SHOULD CARE WHAT THAT HISTORY LOOKS LIKE. SO MAYBE IN OUR NEXT CONTRACT, THAT CAN BE SOMETHING THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED, BUT ONCE AGAIN FOR THE GOOD WORK THAT EVERYBODY DID ON THAT.
01:54:16.654: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
01:54:17.554: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WANTED TO ACKNOWLEDGE ALL THE VOLUNTEERS AT THE JUNETEENTH CELEBRATION AND MENTION THAT I WAS SURPRISED TO SEE COUNCILMEMBER JANE LUMM AS PART OF THE GIVE 365 TEAM. SO THAT WAS A VERY ENJOYABLE EVENT, AS WELL AS THE 50 50th ANNIVERSARY OF PEACE NEIGHBORHOOD CENTER. THEIR PARTY WAS TONIGHT. AND TOM CRAWFORD AND I WERE ABLE TO SNEAK A CUPCAKE IN BEFORE WE CAME TO COUNCIL. AND LASTLY, THE CAUCUS, I ADMINISTERED IS TAKING A SUMMER PAUSE. A LOT OF THINGS ARE CHANGING RIGHT NOW, AS RESTRICTIONS ARE LIFTED WITH THE PANDEMIC AND I'M LOOKING AT OTHER OPTIONS THAT MAY BE LESS FORMAL AND MORE ENJOYABLE. IT'S FOR THE COUNCIL, BUT ALSO THE COMMUNITY. SO WE WANT TO MEET YOUR NEEDS AS WELL. SO THANK YOU.
01:55:31.795: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
01:55:32.730: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. JUST A COUPLE OF QUICK ANNOUANNOUNCEMENTS I NEGLECTED E START OF THE MEETING. THURSDAY, YOU WILL ATTEND A VIRTUAL SEMINAR TO BE PRODUCING, IT'S CALLED "JAMES BALDWIN, A RACE MEETING AND PSYCHOANALYSIS." IF ANYONE IS INTERESTED IN THE NEXUS OF THOSE TOPICS IT LOOKS TO BE PRETTY INTERESTING AND THERE'S A FILM AND SOME INTERVIEW FOOTAGE WITH MR. BALDWIN THAT IS A BIT OF A DOCUMENTARY THAT IT WILL BE DISCUSSING. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU SAW IN THE NEWS, JAMES BALDWIN IS A HERO OF MINE. ABC DISCOVERED A 20/20 VIDEO, AND THEY WERE CANNED. IT WAS REPUGNANT WHAT THE REPORTER ABC SAID ABOUT NOT PUTTING MR. BALDWIN ON THE AIR ANYMORE. I THINK IT'S VERY TIMELY TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. ALSO NORTH SIDE FOOD FOREST WORK DAY IS THIS UPCOMING SUNDAY, JUNE 27th. WE HAD A GREAT TURNOUT THE LAST ONE. IT'S COMING ALONG NICELY. I WANTED TO BRIEFLY -- SOMETIMES I DEDICATE A MOMENT OF SILENCE LIKE AT THE START OF THE MEETING. I WILL DEDICATE TODAY'S MOMENT OF SILENCE TO LANE LESS COULD LA NEIGHBOR, MURDERED BY THE POLICE SON OF SOME GOOD FRIENDS OF MINE AND SOME GOOD NEIGHBORS AND SO LANE LESKO, ON THIS DAY SOME YEARS BACK, ON JUNE 21st. AND SO, YOU KNOW, TO ELAINE LESKO AND ALL OF HIS FAMILY MAY HIS MEMORY BE A BLESSING. THANK YOU.
01:57:13.197: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER.
01:57:13.864: >> Councilmember Song: I WANTED TO GIVE A QUICK UPDATE TO SOME FOLKS WHO MAY HAVE HEARD ABOUT A RECENT SHOOTING. I HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH LOCAL BLACK LEADERS AND ELECTEDS TRYING TO FORM A RESPONSE AHEAD OF SOME WORRIES AND MISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA. BLACK-ASIAN RELATIONS HAVE BEEN STRAINED AND THERE'S AN EFFORT NOW WHERE THE DEDICATION, AND WE ARE ORGANIZING A SOLIDARITY COOKOUT THE NEXT MONTH AND HOPING TO BRING OUR COMMUNITIES TOGETHER, BRING OUR BABIES TOGETHER TO HAVE SOME GOOD FOOD TOGETHER. SO THAT WILL BE COMING FORWARD TO COUNCIL, BECAUSE -- A HANDFUL OF FAMILIES AND WE WANTED TO PULL TOGETHER BEFORE THE SHOOTING. NOW IT LOOKS LIKE WE WILL BE 100 AND OVER, IT HAS TO COME TO COUNCIL REVIEW FOR THE PARK RENTAL. SO WE ARE WORKING WITH THE COMMUNITY ACTION NETWORK WHO KINDLY CAME FORWARD AS A FISCAL SPONSOR FOR THIS. SO NOT CITY-RELATED BUT SOMETHING THAT WILL POP ON THE AGENDA, AS SOON AS STAFF THANKFULLY CAN HOPEFULLY REVIEW THAT. SO PROBABLY END OF JULY, LOTS OF GOOD FOOD AND LOTS OF GOOD PEOPLE AND HOPEFULLY SOME GOOD WORK AHEAD. AND ALSO THANKS TO THE COUNTY BLACK CAUCUS FOR COMING FORWARD AND WORKING SO QUICKLY ON THE STATEMENT AGAINST HATE IN THE COUNTY. THANKS.
01:58:47.291: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
01:58:49.560: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. I WANTED TO CONGRATULATE THE ANN ARBOR HOUSING COMMISSION AND THE COMMUNITY ACTION NETWORK ON THE GRAND
