00:00:10.150: >> Chair Milshteyn: WELCOME TO THE WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 7th, 2019, CITY PLANNING COMMISSION MEETING. WE WILL BEGIN WITH THE MEETING WITH A ROLL CALL. [ ROLL CALL ]
00:00:38.312: >> Planning Manager:  WE HAVE A QUORUM THIS EVENING.
00:00:41.715: >> Chair Milshteyn: DO WE HAVE ANY INTRODUCTIONS IN.
00:00:44.685: >> Planning Manager:  NO THIS EVENING.
00:00:47.688: >> Chair Milshteyn: ALL THOSE IN FAVOR OF THE AGENDA, PLEASE SAY AYE. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. MINUTES OF PREVIOUS MEETING. BEFORE US THIS EVENING, WE HAVE THE JUNE 18th, 2019, MINUTES. DO I HAVE A COMMISSIONER THAT WILL MOVE IN MOVED BY COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL AND SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER SAUVE. ANY DISCUSSION? ALL THOSE IN FAVOR, PLEASE SAY AYE. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. MOVING ON TO REPORTS FROM CITY ADMINISTRATION, CITY COUNCIL, PLANNING MANAGER, PLANNING COMMISSION OFFICERS AND COMMITTEES, WRITTEN COMMUNICATIONS AND PETITIONS. WE BEGIN WITH COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN WITH THE REPORT FROM CITY COUNCIL.
00:01:23.924: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR. EXCUSE ME. CITY COUNCIL MET MONDAY NIGHT TO DISCUSS A FEW MATTERS OF INTEREST. EXPLICITLY WITH THE RELEVANCE TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION, AT FIRST READING TWO AMENDMENTS TO THE UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE WERE PASSED APPROVED FOR SECOND READING. THE FIRST THE CHANGE TO THE OFFICE DISTRICT PERMITTED USES ALLOWING MODEST AMOUNT OF RESTAURANT USE IN OUR OFFICE DISTRICT. THE SECOND, CLEANING UP SOME INCONSISTENCIES BETWEEN CHAPTER 55 55 AND THE U.D.C. SOME OF THE CLERICAL ERRORS THAT WE HAVE BEEN CLEANING UP AS THE U.C.D. HAS GONE INTO PRACTICE. THREE ITEMS -- EXCUSE ME. WE AWN ADDITIONAL CITY COUNCIL APPROVED THE ANNEXATION OF 614 RIVERVIEW, THE WILSON-BARRY ANNEXATION. AND THREE ITEMS OF ADJACENT RELEVANCE. THREE ROAD CONFIGURATIONS WERE ON THE CITY COUNCIL AGENDA FOR MONDAY NIGHT. THESE WOULD HAVE BEEN ROAD DIETS THAT WOULD HAVE IMPROVED BIKE FACILITIES AND PEDESTRIAN FACILITIES ON EARHART, GREEN AND TRAVERWOOD. TRAVERWOOD DID PASS AND EARHART AND GREEN DID NOT.
00:02:41.802: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU. MR. LENART, DO YOU HAVE A REPORT FOR US?
00:02:47.274: >> Councilmember Ackerman: ONE MORE COMMENT. THERE WAS SOME COMMENT IN THE AGENDA ITEM QUESTIONS. THE COUNCILMEMBER THAT WAS -- A COUNCILMEMBER HAS INDICATED THAT THEY WOULD LIKE US TO QUICKEN OUR PACE WITH RESPECT TO SHORT-TERM RENTALS AND OUR EXPLORATION OF POSSIBLE REGULATIONS. SO I WANTED TO SHARE THAT FEEDBACK AS THAT INFLUENCES OUR WORKLOAD.
00:03:12.166: >> Chair Milshteyn: OKAY. MR. LENART.
00:03:13.534: >> Planning Manager:  JUST BRIEFLY, AT THE WORKING SESSION NEXT WEEK, I WILL BE PRESENTING MY FIRST DRAFT OF PROPOSED U.D.C. CHANGES IN RESPONSE TO THE MICHIGAN REGULATION AND TAXATION OF MARIJUANA ACT. SO IT'S THE RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA CHANGES, AND BECAUSE OF SOME TIME FRAMES BUILT INTO THE -- INTO THE STATE LAW AND EMERGENCY RULES, I HAVE TAKEN LIBERTY OF ALSO PROGRESSING TO A SCHEDULED PUBLIC HEARING AT THE SECOND AUGUST -- THE AUGUST 20th MEETING, I BELIEVE, AS WELL. SO LOTS TO COME IN A SHORT TIME ON THAT.
00:03:55.542: >> Chair Milshteyn: PLANNING COMMISSION OFFICERS AND COMMITTEES? ANY REPORTS? NONE. WRITTEN COMMUNICATIONS AND PETITIONS? WE HAD I BELIEVE ONE PIECE OF WRITTEN COMMUNICATION THAT ARRIVED LATE THIS EVENING. ALL RIGHT. AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION. AT THIS TIME, IS THERE ANYONE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION IN REGARDS TO AN ITEM THAT IS NOT ON THE AGENDA THIS EVENING? IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION REGARDING AN ITEM NOT ON THE AGENDA THIS EVENING, YOU MAY STEP UP TO THE PODIUM, STATE YOUR NAME FOR THE RECORD AND YOU HAVE UP TO THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION. I SEE NO ONE JUMPING UP FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. WE WILL MOVE ON TO THE NEXT ITEM ON OUR AGENDA WHICH IS PUBLIC HEARINGS SCHEDULED FOR OUR NEXT BUSINESS MEETING.
00:04:49.163: >> Planning Manager:  AS I JUST MENTIONED, THE PROPOSED NEW PUBLIC HEARING IS THE UNIFIED CODE WITH RESPECT TO THE MARIJUANA ACT, CHANGES TO 55, AND SECTION 5.16. ABOUT G MEDICAL MARIJUANA FACILITY AND TABLE 5.19-1, OFF-STREET PARKING AND 5.2 DEFINITIONS.
00:05:15.756: >> Chair Milshteyn: AND THE NOTICE DOES STATE AS AUGUST 20th, BUT THE NOTICE HAAGENDAHAS SEPTEMBER 20th, BUTS ACTUALLY AUGUST 20th. UNFINISHED BUSINESS. THE SIGN ORDINANCE AMENDMENTS FOR CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL. AND WE'LL HEAD FOR A QUICK STAFF REPORT OR TO OUR CONSULTANT.
00:05:40.113: >> GOOD EVENING, JILL DANE WITH GIBBLE WEBSTER.
00:05:48.021: >> WE HAVE A REVISED DRAFT SIGNED ORDINANCE, BASED ON THE COMMENTS THAT WE HEARD BACK IN MAY AT THE PUBLIC HEARING THAT WE HELD. JUST TO HIGHLIGHT, I WILL GO THROUGH THE LITTLE SLIDE SHOW THAT WE DID A FEW SLIDES JUST TO CATCH EVERYBODY UP AGAIN, REFRESH YOUR MEMORY ON WHERE WE HAVE BEEN AND WHERE WE ARE NOW. SO, AGAIN, THE CITY IS UPDATING ITS SIGN ORDINANCE TO INCLUDE NEW AND INNOVATIVE SIGN STANDARDS AND REFLECT SOME OF THE EVOLVING TECHNOLOGIES, AS WELL AS A GENERAL UPDATE OF THE SIGN REGULATIONS. WE HAD SEVERAL STEPS IN THE PROCESS OF DOING THIS DRAFT, THAT STARTED QUITE SOMETIME AGO, ACTUALLY. WE ARE BETWEEN NUMBERS 10 AND 11 RIGHT NOW. WE HELD THE PUBLIC HEARING AND YOUR NEXT STEP IS TO MAKE A RECOMMENDATION WHEN YOU ARE READY TO DO SO. WE HAVE HAD SEVERAL MEETS WITH YOU, AS WELL AS A COUPLE OF MEETINGS WITH THE H.D.C. AND THE D.D.A., WE HAD TWO OPEN HOUSES, ONE WITH THE SI SIGN CONTRACTORS AND ONE WITH THE PUBLIC. AND YOU REMEMBER WE HAD A PICTURE OF THE ONLINE PLATFORM, GIVING PEOPLE AN OPPORTUNITY A CHANCE TO UPLOAD THE SIGNS THAT THEY LIKED AND THOSE THAT THEY DIDN'T. THIS IS ONE OF THOSE EXAMPLES. WHAT HAS CHANGED IN THE SIGN ORDINANCE? THESE ARE CHANGES THAT YOU HAVE ALREADY PRETTY MUCH SEEN WHICH INCLUDE THE UPDATED ORGANIZATION, THE MORE DETAILED AND FOCUSED INTENT STATEMENT. WE UPDATED THE PROHIBITED SIGN SECTION. WE ADDED A NEW CONSTRUCTION OF LANGUAGE SECTION THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH YOUR OTHER CODES. UPDATED THE GENERAL PROVISIONS AND WE UPD UPDATED PERMANENT AND TEMPORARY SIGNS. SUBSTANTIALLY UNCHANGED WERE ANY OF THE STANDARDS RELATING TO PERMITS, LIABILITY INSURANCE, AUTHORIZED SIGNING, AND PENALTIES AND ENFORCEMENT. WE DID UPDATE THE CALCULATION OF SIGN AREA. WE UPDATED THAT FROM USING ANY KIND OF GEOMETRIC FIGURE TO ENCLOSE THE EXTREME ELEMENTS OF THE SIGNAGE, JUST TO SIMPLY A RECTANGLE TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR BOTH APPLICATION AND REVOW AND ENFORCEMENT. WE ALSO PROVIDED AN INCENTIVE, AS YOU MAY RECALL FOR A BLACK BACKGROUND, AS A WAY TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF SIGNAGE. THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WE TALKED ABOUT IN TERMS OF -- ALSO WITH MATTE VERSUS REFLECTIVE SURFACES. THE FREE STANDING SIGN AREA ALLOWS FOR SUPPORTING STRUCTURES. WE SPENT SOME TIME TALKING ABOUT SIGN ILLUMINATION, FOCUSING REALLY ON GLARE CONTROL, SHIELDING ILLUMINATION BASED ON THE LUMINARY DESIGN AND IN RESPONSE TO SOME ADDITIONAL COMMENTS THAT WE RECEIVED, WE HAVE PROVIDED A NEW -- A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A REFINEMENT OF THAT SECTION ON ILLUMINATION, WHICH I BELIEVE THAT YOU HAVE THIS EVENING THAT'S THE NEW PAGE 9 ALTERNATE. SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN TALK ABOUT IN A COUPLE OF MINUTES. AGAIN, THE HIGHLIGHTS OF THE CHANGES FOR PERMANENT SIGNS WE REMOVED THE TERM MESSAGE UNITS AND THAT FORM OF CALCULATION FOR IMPROVED APPLICATION REVIEW AND ENFORCEMENT. AS IT'S ONE THE THINGS THAT WE ARE STRIVING TO DO, WORKING WITH STAFF, MAKING SURE THAT EVERYTHING THAT WE PUT INTO THE SIGN ORDINANCE AND GENERALLY SPEAKING ANYTHING YOU PUT INTO ANY OF YOUR ORDINANCES SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE ENFORCED EASILY, BECAUSE NO ORDINANCE IS WORTH ANYTHING IF YOU CAN'T ENFORCE IT. SO THAT'S SOMETHING TO KEEP IN MIND. WE ALSO REMOVED SOME OF THE EXCEPTIONS FOR SPECIFIC TYPES OF SIGNS. AGAIN, EARLY ON IN THE PROCESS, WE TALKED ABOUT TRYING TO BE AS CONTENT NEUTRAL AS POSSIBLE, AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT ONE OF THE OTHER CHANGES THAT WE MADE SINCE YOUR LAST -- THE LAST TIME YOU SAW THE DRAFT. SO OVERALL, THE SIGN STANDARDS HAVEN'T CHANGED. REALLY THE AREA OF THE WALL AND FREE STANDING OR GROUND SIGNS HASN'T CHANGED. THE THEATERS ARE STILL ALLOWED TO HAVE THE ADDITIONAL -- OR LARGER CHANGEABLE MESSAGE SIGNAGE, AND THE RESIDENT SIGNS ALSO WOULD BE CONSIDERED PERMANENT SIGNS AS WELL. WE ADDED STANDARDS FOR SPECIFIC SIGNS INCLUDING PROJECTING SIGNS AND HANGING SIGNS. ALLEY SIGNS AND AWNING AND CAN CANOPY SIGNS. WE MADE SOME CHANGES TO THE CHANGEABLE MESSAGE SIGNS. LAST TIME WE TALKED QUITE A BIT ABOUT THE CHANGEABLE MESSAGE SIGNS, THE ELECTRONIC MESSAGE SIGNS, THE FREQUENCY OF CHANGE, THE SIZE OF THE CHANGE AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE GOT -- I DON'T WANT TO SAY STUCK, BUT MAYBE WE WERE EXPLORING THIS A LITTLE BIT, WAS THE IDEA OF TIME AND TEMPERATURE. AND PEOPLE SEEM TO LIKE HAVING THE TIME AND TEMPERATURE AS A PROVISION ON THE ELECTRONIC MESSAGE SIGNS. BUT ON YOUR CURRENT SYSTEM OF CHANGING EVERY 15 MINUTES THAT, DOESN'T REALLY MATTER TOO MUCH FOR TEMPERATURE, ALTHOUGH IN MICHIGAN, YOU NEVER KNOW. BUT REALLY FOR TIME, THAT DIDN'T MAKE A LOT OF SENSE TO KEEP IT THAT WAY. ONE OF THE SUGGESTIONS WE HAD WAS TO HAVE 50% OF THE SIGN AREA COULD BE AN ELECTRONIC MESSAGE SIGN, SHRINKING THAT EVEN FURTHER TO 25% AND NOT SPECIFYING WHETHER THAT BE FOR TIME OR TEMPERATURE. WE HAD TALKED ABOUT MAYBE JUST MAKING AN EXCLUSION. SO CHANGEABLE MESSAGE SIGNS CAN CHANGE EVERY 15 MINUTES, EXCEPT FOR TIME AND TEMPERATURE, BUT WE WERE REALLY TRYING TO KEEP THAT CONTENT NEUTRALITY AS A THEME THROUGHOUT THE OR NANCE. SO WE POSE -- ORDINANCE. SO WE POSE THAT AS AN OPTION FOR YOU. WE ALSO DID, YEAH, THE STANDARDS AGAIN FOR  I HUMIDITY NATION. WE DID THAT -- ILLUMINATION. WE DID ADD THE DEFINITIONS FOR FULLY -- FULL CUTOFF FIXTURES, SKY GLOW, LIGHT TRESPASSING AND GLARE, THINGS THAT WE THINK ARE IMPORTANT TO FIND IN THE ORDINANCE. WE DID NOT MAKE ANY CHANGES SINCE THE PREVIOUS DRAFT TO THE LIMIT FOR INTERIOR WINDOW SIGNAGE. AND, AGAIN, WE DID ADD THOSE OTHER DEFINITIONS AS WELL AS THE TERM HISTORIC SIGN AND THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WE DID TALK ABOUT. WE NAMED A LOT OF DIN SIGNS THAT WE -- OF DIFFERENT SIGNS THAT WE THINK OF AS BEING HISTORIC. SO WE ADDED SOME PROVISIONS TO ALLOW THE H.D.C. TO LABEL A SIGN AS BEING HISTORIC AND ALLOW THAT TO BE REPAIRED OR RESTORED AND CONTINUE ON. IN TERMS THE TEMPORARY SIGNS, THIS SECTION WAS UPDATED, AS YOU REMEMBER QUITE A BIT TO BE CONSISTENT WITH CURRENT CASE LAW SPECIFICALLY REED vs. THE TOWN OF GILBERT. AGAIN, REMOVING THE CONTENT-BASED STANDARDS, CALLING CERTAIN SIGNS AS REAL ESTATE SIGNS OR POLITICAL SIGNS, THEY ARE ALL TEMPORARY SIGNS AND SO THE NEW PROVISIONS COVER ALL OF THOSE TYPES OF SIGNS. I WON'T GO THROUGH THE TABLE TOO MUCH, BUT WE CAN GO BACK TO THAT. THE TEMPORARY SIGNS, AGAIN, THE EXAMPLES WE HAD IN THE PAST. THEY HAVEN'T CHANGED. I THINK I HIT THE HIGHLIGHTS OF THE CHANGES SINCE YOUR LAST DRAFT. WE DID ADD A CLARIFICATION THAT SIGNS SHOULD BE TURNED OFF AFTER 10 P.M. OR THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS, WHICHEVER IS LATER. AND I BELIEVE THAT IS THE EXTENT OF THE CHANGES THAT WE HAVE MADE SINCE OUR LAST DRAFT. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE.
00:12:52.612: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU. MR. CHENG, IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE FROM THE STAFF?
00:12:56.182: >> NO, I THINK SHE COVERED IT. I'M HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE.
00:13:02.722: >> Chair Milshteyn: AT THIS TIME, I WOULD LIKE TO OPEN UP A PUBLIC HEARING. MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC CAN ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION FOR THREE MINUTES. PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS FOR THE RECORD.
00:13:11.631: >> MY NAME IS SALLY UIE, PAULINE BOULEVARD IN ANN ARBOR. I'M A MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE THAT HAS THE LIGHTING ORDINANCE DRAFT FOR ANN ARBOR. AND WE WOULD LIKE TO NOTE THAT THE PLANNING COMMISSION HAS INVESTED A GREAT DEAL OF EFFORT IN DEVELOPING THE LIGHTING ORDINANCE, WHICH YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH, IN THE DRAFT FORM THAT WE HAVE COMPLETED AND WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THE CURRENT DRAFT OF THE SIGN ORDINANCE DOES HAVE SOME WAYS IN WHICH IT WILL UNDERMINE THAT EFFORT. IN M PARTICULAR, BY ALLOWING VEY LITTLE APPLICATION OF UP LIGHTING OF SIGNS UP TO 1800 LUMENS. THIS IS THE EQUIVALENT OF A 120-WATT LIGHTBULB AND THIS HAS BEEN CONFIRMED BY THE INTERNATIONAL DARK SKY ASSOCIATION TO BE A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF LIGHT POLLUTION, LIGHT TRESPASS OFF OF THAT AND A CONCERN FOR THE ENVIRONMENT. WE ALSO FEEL THAT IT WOULD BE VERY SENSIBLE AT THIS STAGE, SINCE WE ALREADY HAVE A DRAFT LIGHTING ORDINANCE UNDER YOUR CONSIDERATION, TO USE THE SAME FRAMEWORK, MEANING THE SAME WORDING, THE SAME CONCEPTS FOR DEVELOPING THE LIGHTING OF SIGNS AS FOR ANY OTHER ILLUMINATED TARGETS THAT ARE OUT THERE. SO IN PARTICULAR, SIGNS ARE VERTICAL TARGETS AS OPPOSED TO HORIZONTAL TARGETS AND SO THE DRAFT WORDING THAT WE HAVE SUGGESTED THOUSAND BACK IN APRIL SUGGESTED TO YOU BACK IN APRIL, AND YOU CONSIDERED AGAIN IN MAY, WE FEEL IT ONLY SENSIBLE TO HAVE THE SIGN ORDINANCE AND THE LIGLIGHTING ORDINANCE TO BE CONSISTENT WITH EACH OTHER IN THAT SENSE. THE OTHER IS THE TIMING OF WHEN SIGNS ARE ILLUMINATED RELATED TO DAWN AND DUSK, WHICH IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT IN THE CURRENT SIGN ORDINANCE AND THE LIGHTING ORDINANCE DRAFT. SO THESE ARE OUR PRIMARY CONCERNS AND OTHERS WILL MENTION OUR -- OUR ADDITIONAL REMIND YOU OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE FOR THE HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS, IN PARTICULAR, FOR BISHOP F BI BIRDS THAT ARE Y SIGN LIGHTING THAT'S UPWARD INTO THE SKY. SO WE HOPE THAT IF THERE IS -- IF FOR SOME REASON IT IS CONSIDERED THAT THE CURRENT DRAFT IN ITS CURRENT FORM IS MORE DESIRABLE THAT WE WOULD AT LEAST HAVE SOME KIND OF REASONING PUBLICIZED AS TO WHY THESE DECISIONS WERE TAKEN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
00:15:48.354: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU.
00:15:57.297: >> HELLO. MY NAME IS JACK BRISBANE. I LIVE AT 47329, ASHLEY COURT, CANTON, MICHIGAN. MEMBER OF THE DARK SKI SOCIETY SOCIETY -- DARK SKY SOCIETY HERE AND I ALSO HAD THE SAME CONCERNS AS PREVIOUSLY EXPRESSED ONE OF THEM BEING THE 1800 LUMENS WHICH IS QUITE BRIGHT AND THE 120-WATT BULB. THE OTHER THING THAT I'M LOOKING AT IS THE IDEA OF BIRDS AND ENVIRONMENT, AND I KNOW IT'S A LITTLE BIT NEW, BUT THERE'S A LOT OF RESEARCH BEHIND THAT AND HOW IT AFFECTS THE CIRCADIAN RHYTHM OF BIRDS. YOU WILL FIND OUT THAT THERE'S SOME ISSUES ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT AN HOW IT AFFECTS, I WILL SAY, OTHER TYPES OF ANIMALS BESIDES BIRDS AND THAT. MY MAIN INTEREST IS TO SEE AN ORDINANCE PASSED HERE THAT REALLY WORKS WITH THE ENVIRONMENT AND IS BENEFICIAL TO PEOPLE AND THE CIRCADIAN RHYTHM. THE LUMENS OF 1800 OR LESS, I WOULD LIKE TO GET RID OF THAT, AS MS. OIE TALKED ABOUT. AND WITH THAT, I WILL CONCLUDE MY DISCUSSION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I APPRECIATE IT.
00:17:12.105: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU.
00:17:19.112: >> HI. HELLO, MY NAME IS KAREN WHITE. I LIVE AT 2719 CRANBROOK. AND NOW FOR A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT TOPIC. I, IN MY DAY GIG, AM THE PROJECT COORDINATOR FOR THE OBSERVATORY. THE OBSERVEY OVERLOOKING THE MEDICAL CAMPUS. AND AS PART OF THE PLANS GOING FORWARD, WE ARE MAKING A SIGNIFICANT PUSH TO GET THE UNIVERSITY TO ROPE IN ITS UP LIGHTS, AND REALLY WORK ON THE BENEFIT -- PUBLICIZING THE BENEFITS OF DARK SKY TO STUDENTS, ADMINISTRATORS AND FACULTY AS WELL AS IN THE CITY HERE IN GENERAL. AND SO I REALLY HOPE THAT THIS SIGN ORDINANCE CAN BE SORT OF PUT ADDED PRESSURE ON THE UNIVERSITY TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU CAN. THAT UPLIGHTING IN PARTICULAR IS REALLY WRETCHED. RIGHT NOW, WE ARE WATCHING THE PLIEDES START TO PASS THROUGH OUR NEIGHBORHOOD. MY HUSBAND WANTED TO TAKE OUR DAUGHTER OUT TO SEE THAT. COULDN'T DO THAT JUST LAYING IN THE BACKYARD. HAD TO DRIVE QUITE A WAYS OUT OF TOWN AND FINALLY ENDED UP LAYING IN WARREN STREET -- WARREN ROAD TO FIND A PLACE DARK ENOUGH TO ACTUALLY SEE THE METEOR SHOWER. SO IF YOU WOULD PLEASE -- ANYTHING YOU CAN DO TO TIGHTEN UP THIS LANGUAGE SO THAT THE UP LIGHTING, EVEN IF IT'S JUST -- OUR INTENT IS TO ROPE THIS IN AND PULL IT DOWN AND PULL IT DOWN AND PULL IT DOWN AS WE GO FORWARD. MAYBE YOU CAN'T DO IT ALL AT ONCE, BUT I THINK THE INTENTION SHOULD BE CLEAR AND IN PLAIN ENGLISH. WE WANT TO STOP THIS ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION FROM UP LIGHT. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
00:19:15.962: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN THE AUDIENCE?
00:19:26.372: >> GOOD EVENING, MY NAME IS JOHN MERSKI. I LIVE AT 505MERSON SPACE. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY FOR TONIGHT, I'M A MEMBER OF THE WORKING GROUP THAT'S BEEN WORKING ON THE LIGHTING ORDINANCE. FIRST OF ALL, I WOULD LIKE TO COMMEND STAFF, THE CONSTANTS AND THE PLANNING COMMISSION ON -- CONSULTANTS AND THE LAPPING COMMISSION ON WHAT WE BELIEVE IS AN EXCELLENT DRAFT OF A NEW SIGN ORDINANCE AN UPDATED SIGN ORDINANCE. I WOULD LIKE TO BOOK END THE COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE ALREADY, AND THAT IS I WANT TO IMPRESS UPON ALL OF YOU THAT WE THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THE SIGN ORDINANCE AND THE LIGHTING ORDINANCE DRAFT THAT WE HAVE BE CONSISTENT. INDEED, AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED, THE SIGN IS NOTHING MORE THAN A VERTICAL TARGET, JUST A  LIKE A BUILDING OR ANYTHING ELSE, AND IT'S IMPORTANT WE HAVE CONSISTENT LANGUAGE ACROSS THE TWO OF THEM. SO WE ARE STRONGLY ADVOCATING FOR FULLY SHIELDED LUMENARRIES IN ALL CASES. WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE, AS MENTIONED, ELIMINATION OF THE EXCEPTION FOR UP LIT SIGNS WHICH ALLOWS FOR UP TO 1800 LUMENS AND WE BELIEVE THIS UNDERMINES THE LIGHTING ORDINANCE DRAFT. WE WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SEE CONSISTENT LANGUAGE IN TERMS OF LIGHTING BETWEEN DAWN AND DUSK. WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE LIMIT ON THE LUMENS FOR INTERNAL SIGNS TO 100MIPS. BASICALLY IN CONCLUSION. LIGHTING, WHICH IS NOT LIMITED TO THE TARGET SIGN IS WASTED ENERGY AND LIGHTING. AND IS LIKELY A NUISANCE. THE SAME CAN BE SAID FOR EXCESSIVE LIGHTING. IT'S UNNECESSARY FOR LEGIBILITY. IT'S ALSO WASTEFUL AND IS ALSO A POTENTIAL NUISANCE. SO IF, INDEED, WE SEE DEVIATIONS FROM THOSE IN THE FINAL DRAFT OF THE SIGN ORDINANCE, WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE WHAT THE RATIONALE IS FOR THAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR CONSIDERING OUR COMMENTS. THANKS.
00:21:39.405: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION IN REGARDS TO THIS ITEM? SEEING NO ONE, I WILL CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING AND I WILL READ THE MOTION. THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION HEREBY RECOMMENDS THAT THE MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL APPROVE THE AMENDMENTS TO CHAPTER 55, UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE, SECTION 5.24. MOVED BY COMMISSIONER SAUVE, SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN. WE ARE IN DISCUSSION. COMMISSIONER BRIGGS.
00:22:13.940: >> Commissioner Briggs: YEAH. SO I WANTED TO SAY THANK YOU SO MUCH. THERE WAS A LOT OF FEEDBACK WE GAVE YOU LAST TIME, IN TERMS OF, YOU KNOW, UPDATING THE ORDINANCE. I REALLY LIKE THE CHANGES TO THE HISTORIC SIGNS TOO. I THINK THAT'S A NICE ADDITION. THAT WAS CREATIVE HOW YOU GUYS WORKED THAT OUT. SO THANK YOU. AND I WANTED TO THANK ALL THE -- COMMISSIONER MILLS AND I WERE ALSO SERVED ON THAT LIGHTING SUBCOMMISSION, FOR THOSE WHO ARE NEW TO THE COMMISSION. IT LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE NOW SORT OF A DRAFT AMENDMENT THAT SORT OF ADDRESSES MOST OF THE COMMENTS THAT WERE SORT OF MADE DURING PUBLIC COMMENT; IS THAT CORRECT?
00:22:54.680: >> THAT'S CORRECT. I'M ACTUALLY COMPARING THE TWO RIGHT NOW.
00:22:59.385: >> Commissioner Briggs: WHEN I LOOKED AT IT, I'M NOT SURE IF YOU -- THE ONLY DIFFERENCES THAT I SORT OF NOTICED THAT MAYBE LANGUAGE THAT IS STILL MISSING FROM THAT, IN NUMBER FOUR -- NO. -- YEAH, IN NUMBER THREE, ON THE ONE ON PAGE 9, THE GLARE, IN THIS DRAFT -- IN THE MOST RECENT DRAFT, IT SAYS -- IT MENTIONED FULL CUTOFF FIXTURES AND THEN THE RECOMMENDATION FROM THE INTERNATIONAL DARK SKIES ASSOCIATION WAS FULLY SHIELDED AND WHILE FULL CUTOFF ACTUALLY IS A MORE RESTRICTIVE TERM THAN FULLY SHIELDED, IT APPEARS FROM THE NATIONAL FEEDBACK WE HAVE BEEN GETTING FROM THE, INTERNATIONAL DARK SKIES THAT THE INDUSTRY MAY BE MOVING TO FULLY SHIELDED. THE RECOMMENDATION IS TO USE THAT LANGUAGE. MAYBE YOU COULD DISCUSS KIND OF WHY YOU REACHED THAT CONCLUSION.
00:23:58.044: >> THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS.
00:24:01.447: >> Commissioner Briggs: YEAH.
00:24:02.081: >> WE WENT -- WE UNDERSTAND THAT FULLY SHIELDED AND FULL CUTOFF FIXTURES SOMETIMES ARE USED INTERCHANGEABLY. AND WHAT OUR RESEARCH SHOWED WAS THAT THE FULL -- AND THE WAY THAT WE DEFINED FULL CUTOFF IS REALLY ADDRESSING THE GLARE ISSUE. SO THE LIGHTING BETWEEN THE 80 AND 90%, BELOW THAT HORIZONTAL LINE SO THAT IT NOT ONLY ENSURES THAT THE LIGHT IS BEING DIRECTED DOWNWARD, BUT IT'S ALSO ADDRESSING SOME OF THE GLARE ISSUE. BUT THAT IS A TERM THAT I THINK -- YOU KNOW, WHICHEVER WAY YOU ARE COMFORTABLE WITH IN THE ORDINANCE, IT ALSO SEEMED, THOUGH -- AS THOUGH -- AND IT WAS THE -- AND I WROTE IT, IT'S THE I.S.N.E.A.
00:24:45.758: >> Commissioner Briggs: YEAH.
00:24:46.392: >> THEY WERE SAYING THAT THERE ARE SOME LIGHT FIXTURES THAT ARE PARTIAL CUTOFF FIXTURES THAT MAY BE CONSIDERED FULLY SHIELDED. AND YET THEY STILL HAVE THE LOOE LUMENS THAT WOULD CAUSE GLARE, BUT WE WOULD LEAVE THAT TO YOU AND THE EXPERTS REVIEWING THE LIGHTING ORDINANCE.
00:25:12.885: >> Commissioner Briggs: WHEN I WAS REVIEWING DEFINITIONS TODAY, I -- PERSONALLY, IT FELT LIKE FULL CUT OFF. I UNDERSTOOD WHY YOU REACHED THAT CONCLUSION. IT'S SIMPLY THE FEEDBACK THAT WE HAVE RECEIVED FROM THE NATIONAL DARK SKIES ASSOCIATION THAT LED US IN THE LIGHTING ORDINANCE TO GO WITH FULLY SHIELDED AND TO BE CONSISTENT BETWEEN THE TWO, WE MIGHT WANT TO USE THAT LANGUAGE, BUT IT'S MAYBE WORTH WHILE TO HAVE MORE DISCUSSION AROUND THAT, BUT I THINK FOR CONSISTENCY, WE MIGHT WANT TO USE FULLY SHIELDED. THEN THE OTHER PIECE THAT I THINK IS NOT IN HERE, BECAUSE I THINK IT LOOKS LIKE ALL THE 1800 LUMENS THAT IS COVERED. IN NUMBER SIX WHERE IT STARTS WITH OUTDOOR SIGNS, IT -- THE -- IT MIGHT BE USEFUL TO DESIGN WHAT EXCESSIVE LIGHT OUTPUT, IS WHICH IN SORT OF THE DRAFT RECOMMENDATIONS, IT WAS SIGNS THAT BOTH OF THESE TYPES SHOULD NOT EXCEED THE LUMENS 100 MIPS.
00:26:10.843: >> YOU KNOW, WE DID TALK ABOUT HAVING THE LEVEL OF LUMENS MEASUREMENT AS A MAXIMUM AND WHEN WE HAD THE OPEN HOUSE WITH THE SIGN CONTRACTORS, IT WAS OUR UNDERSTANDING FROM THEM THAT THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO MEASURE AT THE END WHEN THE SIGN IS COMPLETE. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO CHIME IN CHRIS OR BRETT ON THAT AT ALL, BUT IT SEEMED LIKE THAT THAT MIGHT BE A DIFFICULT THING TO MEASURE, AT LEAST WHEN A PERSON IS GOING TO ORDER A SIGN TO BE MADE BY A SIGN MANUFACTURER, THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE UNDERSTOOD COULD BE JUST ORDERED OFF THE SHELF LIKE IT HAS TO BE THIS.
00:26:46.178: >> Planning Manager:  AND I THINK ANOTHER PIECE OF IT WAS -- MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE INDUSTRY IS DEAF IN DEFINITELY MOVING INT DIRECTION. I THINK WITH ELECTRONIC, THAT IS OMNIPRESENT. IT'S A VIRTUAL STANDARD. THIS DEFINITION INCLUDES, I WOULD SAY, LESS TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED SIGNS TOO. I'M SURE THAT SOME OF THOSE ARE ADJUSTABLE IN THAT MEAN. I DON'T KNOW THAT ALL THE SIGNS MEETING THAT DEFINITION ARE ADJUSTABLE IN THE SAME METHOD. SO I THINK THAT WAS ANOTHER CRITERIA, BUT CERTAINLY, IF THERE WAS -- WE COULD PROBABLY INCLUDE SOME SORT OF LANGUAGE TO THAT EFFECT OR EQUIVALENT. THAT MIGHT BECOME A QUESTION OF úDE. I SUSPECT THERE ARE FEW OCCASIONS WHERE THIS IS GOING TO BECOME AN ISSUE, BUT IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE SOME SORT OF STANDARD AS TO WHAT THAT EXCESSIVE LIGHT OUTPUT IS.
00:27:42.101: >> Commissioner Briggs: AND THEN IT'S GREAT THAT IT'S REFERENCING ANN ARBOR LIGHTING ORDINANCE, BA UBECAUSE THAT PROVIDES FOR CHANGES. SO I THINK THAT -- I DON'T KNOW, COMMISSIONER MILLS MIGHT HAVE MORE TO SAY ON THE LIGHTING PIECE OF THINGS.
00:28:01.420: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL.
00:28:03.556: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED BY WHAT'S IN FRONT OF US. I SEE BLACK AND WHITE AND RED STRIKEOUTS AND I SEE THIS BLUE BOLD. IS THAT -- CAN SOMEBODY JUST DEVIBE WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT REALLY, BECAUSE I'M CONFUSED ABOUT -- THIS IS NOT OUR NORMAL STANDARD THAT THINGS HAVE ALREADY BEEN INCORPORATED BEFORE THE PUBLIC COMMENT AND IF YOU COULD JUST KIND OF CLARIFY WHERE THINGS ARE.
00:28:23.375: >> Planning Manager:  YEAH, I'M SORRY FOR THE CONFUSION. SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE ORDINANCE THAT'S ATTACHED TO THE STAFF REPORT THAT WAS ORIGINALLY IN YOUR POCKET, THAT IS THE ORDINANCE UNDER CONSIDERATION. I THINK WE ACTUALLY PROVIDED A HARD COPY WITH THE COVER MEMO ACTUALLY STAPLED TO IT. SO THAT IS THE LIGHTING ORDINANCE AS PROPOSED. BASED ON THESE -- THE FOUR REPRESENTATIVES, TWO FROM THE ENERGY COMMISSION, TWO FROM THE PLANNING COMMISSION, HAVE PROVIDED COMMENTS. THESE WERE SHARED WITH THE PLANNING COMMISSION IN A PREVIOUS MEETING AS WELL. THAT CAME UP AGAIN TODAY. SO IN THE EFFORT OF JUST MAKING SURE THAT YOU HAD THAT INFORMATION, THAT IS THE BLUE AND RED STRIKETHROUGH VERSION. THAT WAS COMMENTS REFLECTED BY THAT GROUP AT THE PREVIOUS AND JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE YOU HAD THAT FOR REFERENCE AND DISCUSSION. AND THEN LASTLY, IN THE CONTEXT OF THAT, OUR CONSULTANT TEAM PUT TOGETHER THE YELLOW PAGE, WHICH IS RESPONDING TO THOSE -- SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS SHOULD THE PLANNING COMMISSION WANT TO PROCEED WITH ADDRESSING SOME OF THOSE. SO THIS IS ONE WAY THAT YOU COULD ADDRESS THAT. CERTAINLY COULD YOU MAKE ANY OF THE OTHER CHANGES AS PROPOSED BY THOSE COMMENTS AS WELL. SO SORRY FOR THE CONFUSION.
00:29:41.186: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: THANKS.
00:29:43.022: >> Chair Milshteyn: FURTHER DISCUSSION. COMMISSIONER MILLS?
00:29:49.161: >> Vice Chair Mills: THANKS. I HAVE ALSO BEEN GOING THROUGH AND KIND OF DOING THE COMPARISON. I THINK THAT A LOT OF THE -- THAT MOST OF THE CONCERNS HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED HERE. THE ONE THING THAT I WOULD NOTE THAT'S DIFFERENT IS THE CURFEW ASSOCIATED. AND HONESTLY, THE -- SO AT WHAT POINT THE LIGHTS HAVE TO BE TURNED OFF, THE CURFEW IN THE SIGN ORDINANCE BEFORE US, THE 10 P.M. OR ONE HOUR AFTER THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS IS ACTUALLY MORE STRINGENT THAN THE TYPE OF CURFEW THAT AT LEAST WE HAD IN THE LATEST LIGHTING ORDINANCE. DOES THAT SEEM RIGHT? BECAUSE WE HAD MIDNIGHT FOR DECORATIVE LIGHTING AND FOR, YOU KNOW, NONRESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS. SO I'M INCLINED TO KEEP THE 10 P.M. I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT THAT'S A DIFFERENCE AND IN THE INTEREST OF TRYING TO ALIGN THESE THINGS -- WHICH I'M SAD THAT WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT THEM AT THE SAME TIME. AGAIN, THIS CHANGE TO S NUMBER EIGHT WHICH REFERENCES THE LIGHTING ORDINANCE WILL HELP TO ENSURE THAT WE GET THAT THROUGH. I'M JUST WONDERING IF WE SHOULD -- IF -- WHETHER WE LIKE THE CURFEW OF THE 10 P.M. OR BUSINESS HOURS OR MIDNIGHT. I THINK I VOTE FOR THAT, BUT I PUT THAT OUT THERE BUT WE PROBABLY WANT TO ALIGN THAT.
00:31:27.726: >> Chair Milshteyn: FURTHER DISCUSSION. COMMISSIONER BRIGGS.
00:31:29.395: >> Commissioner Briggs: I WONDER IF IT WOULD BE OKAY IF SALLY, MIGHT BE ABLE TO COME UP AND WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A DISCUSSION. I FEEL LIKE THERE'S A COUPLE OF PIECES THAT ARE NOT CONSISTENT BETWEEN THE PROPOSED LIGHTING ORDINANCE AND THE -- THIS DRAFT ORDINANCE. ALMOST EVERYTHING HAS BEEN TAKEN CARE OF, AND I THINK ONE IS THE LANGUAGE BETWEEN -- THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FULLY SHIELDED AND FULL CUTOFF AND THEN THE OTHER ONE IS THE -- JUST THE DEFINITION OF EXCESSIVE LIGHT OUTPUT. AN I THINK WE NEED TO JUST COME TO SOME CONCLUSION ABOUT WHETHER THAT -- WHICH DIRECTION WE SHOULD BE HEADED AND THERE MIGHT BE SOME USEFUL FEEDBACK HERE.
00:32:14.606: >> Chair Milshteyn: WITHOUT OBJECTION FROM THE COMMISSION? HI.
00:32:18.477: >> WELL, AGAIN, I WAS SIMPLY TRYING TO PROMOTE THE EXACT CONCEPT OF TRYING TO MAKE THESE TWO DOCUMENTS CONSISTENT WITH EACH OTHER. SO, YES, I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO THAT AND AS YOU SEE FIT, YOU KNOW, IF YOU FEEL THAT THE CURFEW ON ONE IS A BETTER CURFEW THAN THE OTHER, THEN FEEL FREE TO MAKE THOSE CONSISTENT WITH EACH OTHER. AS FOR THE DEFINITION OF FULL CUTOFF VERSUS FULLY SHIELDED. I THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD TO BE CONSISTENT WITH EACH OTHER. I WOULD BE DELIGHTED IF YOU PICKED -- WELL, I WOULD BE DELIGHTED EITHER WAY BECAUSE ON THE ONE HAND, AS COMMISSIONER BRIGGS MENTIONED, THE FULL CUTOFF VERSION IS' MORE STRINGENT REQUIREMENT AS THE CONSULTANTS ALSO MENTIONED AND SO IN PRINCIPLE, THAT'S A BETTER ONE TO BE USING. BUT ACCORDING TO THE INTERNATIONAL DARK SKY ASSOCIATION, THEY ARE SAYING THAT THE STANDARD IN THE FIELD IS ACTUALLY MOVING TOWARDS JUST SIMPLY A VERDICT OF HORIZONTAL CUTOFF WHICH IS THE FULLY SHIELDED DEFINITION. SO YOU COULD BE FORWARD THINKING AND GO WITH THAT OR FULL CUTOFF. AND AS LONG AS THEY ARE CONSISTENT WITH EACH OTHER, THEN I THINK YOU HAVE SOMETHING THAT'S UNIFIED. YOU KNOW, IT'S -- IT'S TO SOME DEGREE UP TO YOU THE DEGREE OF CONSISTENCY THAT YOU WANT BETWEEN THESE TWO DOCUMENTS, BUT I WOULD CERTAINLY ENCOURAGE THEM TO BE CONSISTENT WITH EACH OTHER.
00:33:57.242: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER BRIGGS?
00:33:59.711: >> Commissioner Briggs: WITH THAT SORT OF FEEDBACK -- YOP IFT KNOW IF OTHERS HAVE COMMENTS OR THOUGHTS AROUND THIS. I THINK THERE WAS SOME INTERESTING FEEDBACK FROM SOME THE LUMINARIES THAT WERE PARTIALLY SHIELDED THAT WOULD FIT UNDER THE FULLY SHIELDED DEFINITION, BUT NOT ACTUALLY MEET OUR INTENT AND SO I ACTUALLY SORT OF THINK WE MAY WANT TO GO WITH THE FULL CUTOFF, JUST TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE REACHING THAT AND WE CAN ALWAYS COME BACK AND TWEAK IT IF WE REALIZED DOWN THE LINE THAT WE ARE SEEING ISSUES BUT THAT MAY BE THE MORE STRINGENT WAY TO GO, I THINK. I THINK WE SHOULD PUT THAT, IF THERE'S NO OBJECTIONS, JUST ADD THAT, SIGNS SHOULD NOT EXCEED OVER 100 MIPS IF THERE'S NO OBJECTION. THAT WOULD BE MY MOTION.
00:34:51.663: >> Chair Milshteyn: MR. LENART?
00:34:52.331: >> Planning Manager:  SO AM I -- I AM -- IF I'M UNDERSTANDING THAT MOTION IS INCLUDING THE PROPOSED CHANGES.
00:35:02.174: >> Commissioner Briggs: YEAH.
00:35:02.808: >> City Admin. Lazarus: SUBSTI TU YEAH.>> Planning Manager:  ADDIG LANGUAGE, THAT EXCESSIVE LIGHT IS ANYTHING EXCEEDING 100 MIPS OR --
00:35:24.630: >> Commissioner Briggs: THAT'S WHAT I LIKE TO DO, ARGUE WITH MYSELF.
00:35:27.399: >> Chair Milshteyn: WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER MILLS. DISCUSSION? COMMISSIONER MILLS?
00:35:34.339: >> Vice Chair Mills: I JUST WONDER -- LIKE, THE QUESTION OF ENFORCEMENT AND BEING ABLE TO MEASURE. THIS IS NOT MY EXPERTISE. DO WE HAVE ANYBODY -- I HATE TO PUT YOU ON THE SPOT. IS THERE SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW YOU CAN MEASURE -- LIKE THE 100 MIPS LOOMS, IF IT'S MEASURABLE.
00:35:58.230: >> Planning Manager:  IT'S A SETHING ON A SIGN. WE CAN DOCUMENT WHEN THE SIGN HAS THAT TECHNOLOGY, WE CAN ACTUALLY HAVE THEM DEMONSTRATE AND SHOW US THAT IT IS SET TO THAT. IN FACT, SOME OF THOSE SIGNS CAN BE ADJUSTED REMOTELY TO THAT STANDARD. THE OR EQUIVALENT, I'M LESS -- I'M LESS COMFORTABLE BEING DEFINITIVE ON, BUT AT LEAST IF WE CAN SET THE 100MIBS STANDARD, WE WILL DO OUR PEST THEN IN THE CASE WHERE WE DON'T HAVE THAT TECHNOLOGY, WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO MEASURE THAT. AT THIS POINT, I WOULD SUSPECT THAT IT'S JUST LIKE WE DO EVERYTHING ELSE, WHICH IS NOT WITHOUT ITS LIGHTING METERS AND THE BACKGROUND AND THE LIGHT, BUT I DON'T THINK -- I SEE THAT AS MORE PROBLEMATIC THAN ANY OTHER LIGHTING ENFORCEMENT.
00:36:46.778: >> Vice Chair Mills: EXCELLENT. AS LONG AS WE HAVE THINGS THAT WE CAN ENFORCE, I THINK THAT'S HELPFUL. THE OTHER THING THAT THAT BROUGHT UP, THAT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT IS THE -- THE IDEA THAT THIS IS APPLYING GOING FORWARD TOO. SO TO THE EXTENT THAT NEWER TECHNOLOGY MAY BE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE THIS MEASURED, RIGHT, THAT THIS DOESN'T AUTOMATICALLY TURN OFF EVERY LIGHTED SIGN IN THIS COMMUNITY AT 10:00, WHEN THIS GOES INTO EFFECT. WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT.
00:37:19.177: >> Chair Milshteyn: FURTHER DISCUSSION ON THE AMENDMENT TO THE MOTION. ACTUALLY NOT THE MOTION, BUT THE ORDINANCE. ALL THOSE IN FAVOR, PLEASE SAY AYE. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? ALL RIGHT. FURTHER DISCUSSION. I THINK THERE'S DISCUSSION REGARDING THE TIMING?
00:37:39.097: >> Vice Chair Mills: THERE COULD BE DISCUSSION WITH THE TIMING. I'M HAPPY TO KEEP IT AS IT IS AND WE WILL PUT A PIN IN THIS -- OR I WILL MENTAL -- I WILL PUT A MENTAL NOTE -- SORRY, IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY. THAT WHEN WE DISCUSS THE LIGHTING ORDINANCE, WE KEEP THEM IN SYNC.
00:37:57.649: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER MILLS, CAN YOU REMIND E WHAT THE LIGHTING ORDINANCE CURRENTLY SAYS?
00:38:08.393: >> Vice Chair Mills: MIDNIGHT.
00:38:09.561: >> Chair Milshteyn: OR THE --
00:38:10.195: >> Vice Chair Mills: I CAN PULL IT UP ON MY COMPUTER. SO AT LEAST THE LATEST VERSION I HAD WAS THAT IT'S TALKING ABOUT ILLUMINATION FOR BUILDING FACADES AND LANDSCAPES WHOSE PRIMARY PURPOSE IS DECORATIVE OR FOR ADVERTISING. SO I THINK THAT FITS, IT'S PROHIBITED BETWEEN MIDNIGHT AND 6 A.M., EXCEPT A NONRESIDENTIAL ESTABLISHMENT, MAY REMAIN ILLUMINATED DURING BUSINESS HOURS.
00:38:39.724: >> Chair Milshteyn: OKAY. FURTHER DISCUSSION? COMMISSIONER WOODS.
00:38:45.197: >> Commissioner Woods: SO IT SOUNDS AS IF THE SIGN ORDINANCE IS TELLING -- IS INDICATING AT WHAT TIME THE LIGHTING CAN COME ON IN THE MORNING? YOU SAID 8 A.M. -- WAS IT 8 A.M.?
00:38:56.208: >> Vice Chair Mills: THE LIGHTING ORDINANCE, THAT'S 6 A.M.
00:38:59.911: >> Commissioner Woods: 6 A.M. AND THIS ONE IS INDICATING HOURS OF OPERATION IN TERMS OF WHEN IT WILL BE EXTINGUISHED, BUT IT ISN'T INDICATING WHEN IT CAN BE -- WHEN IT CAN COME ON. SO I THINK WE NEED KEEP IT CONSISTENT EITHER WAY. SO --
00:39:20.065: >> Chair Milshteyn: AND SO THE LIGHTING ORDINANCE, WHICH WILL BE COMING TO US A AT SOME POINT. WILL PROBABLY REFLECT THE 10:00 TIME FRAME.
00:39:44.089: >> Vice Chair Mills: WHAT I HEARD FROM COMMISSIONER WOODS, SHOULD WE PUT A WHEN CAN YOU PUT THE LIGHT BACK ON? I THINK THAT'S A GOOD CONVERSATION. I WOULD BE IN FAVOR OF THAT. WHY DON'T I MAKE A MOTION TO AMEND -- LET ME FIGURE OUT WHAT SECTION IT IS IN HERE.
00:40:10.949: >> Commissioner Woods: I'M LOOKING AT THE DRAFT, BUT IT'S NUMBER 10.
00:40:13.518: >> Vice Chair Mills: OKAY. SO I WILL MAKE A MOTION TO AMEND B10, THE HOURS OF OPERATION TO SAY ALL SIGN ILLUMINATION SHALL BE EXTINGISHED BETWEEN THE HOURS OF 10 P.M. AND  6 A.M. OR ONE HOUR -- THAT'S CONFUSING. HOW DO WE WANT TO DO THAT? YOU KNOW THE INTENT MR. LENART? WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT?
00:40:41.646: >> Planning Manager:  SO JUST -- SO RIGHT NOW, IT IS 10 P.M. OR ONE HOUR AFTER THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS. SO WE'RE SETTING THE EXPECTATION THAT THE SIGN HAS TO GO OFF AT SOME POINT. WHAT IS -- I GUESS I'M TRYING TO GET AT, WHAT IS THE CONCERN OF HAVING -- IF IT'S DURING THE HOURS OF OPERATION, IT WOULD HAVE TO COME ON DURING THE HOURS OF OPERATION IN THE MORNING.
00:41:11.042: >> Vice Chair Mills: IT COULD COME BACK ON.
00:41:18.083: >> Planning Manager:  SO WOULD YOU PROHIBIT THAT THE IT ONLY HAS TO COME ON FOR -- OR IS YOUR INTENTION TO SAY, IT GOES OFF AT 10 OR CLOSE OF BUSINESS, BUT IT MAY COME ON WHEN BUSINESS HOURS OPEN?
00:41:33.665: >> Vice Chair Mills: SO THE SIGN ORDINANCE -- OR SORRY, THE LIGHTING ORDINANCE WOULD SUGGEST THAT IF YOUR BUSINESS DOESN'T START -- IT DOESN'T OPEN UNTIL 8:00, THAT YOU COULD TURN IT ON AT 6:00? BECAUSE IT'S ONLY EXTINGUISHING IT BETWEEN -- SO, IN FACT, AS WRITTEN, IF I'M UNDERSTANDING THIS CORRECTLY, HERE BY NOT HAVING WHEN IT'S ALLOWED TO COME BACK ON IN THE MORNING, THEN THEY COULDN'T TURN IT BACK ON AT 6 A.M. THEY WOULD HAVE TO WAIT TO TURN IT BACK ON UNTIL THEY OPEN UP? IS THAT HOW YOU GO GUYS WOULD INTERPRET IT RIGHT NOW?
00:42:09.467: >> Planning Manager:  I THINK SO BECAUSE THEY ARE OBLIGATED TO TURN IT OFF AFTER THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS -- AFTER THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS. WE ARE RESUME NATEING OVER THAT. I'M HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE CONSULTANT ON THAT LANGUAGE. I THINK IT WILL GO INTO THAT SECTION BUT I WANT TO CLARIFY THE INTENTION. IS THAT THE SIGN ILLUMINATION SHOULD BE CLOSED AT 10:00 OR ONE HOUR AFTER THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS AND IN THE MORNING IT MAY NOT BE TURNED ON UNTIL THE OPEN OF BUSINESS?
00:42:58.583: >> Vice Chair Mills: SURE.
00:42:59.150: >> Planning Manager:  IS THAT THE INTENTION?
00:43:00.418: >> Commissioner Woods: I THINK THAT'S THE INTENSION, BUT THE LIGHTING ORDINANCE IS SAYING YOU CAN HAVE IT OPEN TWO HOURS BEFORE YOUR BUSINESS OPENS AND IN SPRING IT COULD BE EARLIER. I WOULD JUST LIKE TO HAVE THEM CONSISTENT, I GUESS. SO IF YOU CAN WORK WITH THE CONSULTANT OR WHOMEVER. AND THAT IT WOULD MAKE SENSE.
00:43:17.535: >> Planning Manager:  YEAH. I MIGHT SUGGEST A LITTLE BIT OF WIGGLE ROOM FOR THE BUSINESS TO HAVE IT ON BEFORE THE START OF BUSINESS.
00:43:27.112: >> Chair Milshteyn: I WOULD LIKE TO PROPOSE ONE HOUR. SO AN HOUR AFTER CLOSING, AND AN HOUR BEFORE OPENING. 6 A.M. OR AN HOUR AFTER -- OR AN HOUR BEFORE OPENING.
00:43:41.526: >> Vice Chair Mills: I LIKE THAT. AND LOOK WHO SUGGESTED THE CHANGE. I WILL SECOND IT.
00:43:47.265: >> Chair Milshteyn: I WILL SECOND WHAT --
00:43:48.900: >> Vice Chair Mills: WHAT HE SAID. AND YEAH!
00:43:54.038: >> Chair Milshteyn: DOES THAT GIVE YOU ENOUGH, MR. LENART TO GO BY. I WILL ALSO TAKE A LOOK AT OUR CONSULTANTS TO SEE IF THAT'S ENOUGH.
00:44:02.046: >> Planning Manager:  ALL RIGHT. SO PROPOSED AMENDMENT IS ADDING A RESTRICTION THAT ADDITIONALLY FROM REQUIRING THE SIGNAGE TO BE TURNED OFF AFTER THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS, SUBJECT TO THIS LANGUAGE, YOU ALSO MAY NOT ILLUMINATE THE SIGN MORE THAN ONE HOUR IN ADVANCE OF THE OPEN OF BUSINESS.
00:44:19.063: >> Chair Milshteyn: 6 A.M. OR ONE HOUR.
00:44:21.366: >> Vice Chair Mills: WHICHEVER IS EARLIER?
00:44:23.635: >> Planning Manager:  SO IF I OPEN AT 5:00, I CAN'T OPEN THE SIGN?
00:44:31.709: >> Commissioner Briggs: I DON'T THINK WE CAN DO EARLIER, IF WE ARE DOING 24-HOUR BUSINESSES.
00:44:38.183: >> Vice Chair Mills: THEN THEY WOULD NEVER CLOSE.
00:44:40.618: >> Commissioner Briggs: YOU COULDN'T BE REQUIRED TO DO EARLIER. MANMAYBE I'M CONFUSING MYSELF.
00:44:47.358: >> Chair Milshteyn: I'M THINKING FOR A GYM THAT OPENS AT 5, AT 4 A.M. THEY CAN TURN THEIR SIGN ON.
00:44:54.465: >> Vice Chair Mills: RIGHT, YEAH.
00:44:59.671: >> Chair Milshteyn: MISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT.
00:45:01.039: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: IS IT OBVIOUS THAT A 24-HOUR BUSINESS CAN KEEP THEIR SIGN ON THE WHOLE TIME? I WAS LIKE, WHAT DO THEY DO?
00:45:10.348: >> Planning Manager:  YES, BECAUSE THEY WOULD NEVER CLOSE.
00:45:13.718: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: OKAY.
00:45:16.454: >> Chair Milshteyn: SO WE HAVE A MOTION IN REGARDS TO THE TIMING. DOES EVERYBODY UNDERSTAND THE MISSION TO AMEND THE ORDINANCE? ALL THOSE IN FAVOR, PLEASE SAY AYE. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? ALL RIGHT. THAT AMENDMENT IS APPROVED. FURTHER DISCUSSION. COMMISSIONER HAMMER SHH MILT.
00:45:36.674: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: SO -- HAMMERSCHMIDT.
00:45:40.178: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: JUST AS A POINT OF CLARIFICATION, AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'M SEEING THIS, BUT UNDER THE NON-CONFORMING SIGNS SECTION, IT'S 9B5, WHERE IT SAYS NO NON-CONFORMING SIGN SHOULD BE ERECTED AFTER BEING DAMAGED IF IT WOULD COST MORE THAN 50% THAN THE COST OF AN IDENTICAL NEW SIGN. IF THE SIGN IS DAMAGED, WOULD THE SIGN THEN NEED TO BE CONFORMING? I GUESS WHEN I WAS READING -- MAYBE IT'S ME NOT JUST TOTALLY UNDERSTANDING. IT SOUNDED LIKE YOU COULD REPAIR IT. THAT LANGUAGE HAS CONFUSED ME A LITTLE BIT.
00:46:20.385: >> I'M GLAD YOU ASKED THE QUESTION. SO IF IT'S MORE THAN 50% DAMAGED OR THE COST IS MORE THAN 50% OF THE SIGN, THEN IT CAN'T BE REPAIRED, AND IT NEEDS TO BE BROUGHT INTO CONFORMITY WITH THE CURRENT RULES.
00:46:32.397: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: OKAY. BUT IF IT'S LESS THAN 50%, THEY CAN REPAIR IT AND STILL BE NON-CONFORMING.
00:46:38.136: >> CORRECT. GOOD QUESTION.
00:46:45.710: >> Chair Milshteyn: FURTHER DISCUSSION. READY FOR A VOTE.
00:46:47.679: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: SORRY, ONE WHO ARE THING. -- ONE MORE THING. AGAIN, I READ THROUGH THIS, BUT MAYBE I MISSED IT SOMEWHERE. FROM MY UNDERSTANDING, LIKE A COMMERCIAL BUSINESS CAN HAVE, YOU KNOW, ONE SIGN PER STORE FRONT, PER FACADE. I GUESS CAN YOU JUST EXPLAIN IF -- SO SAY YOU HAVE A STRIP MALL OR A SHOPPING CENTER AND EACH STORE HAS THEIR OWN SIGN. WHAT ABOUT WHEN YOU HAVE LIKE THE SIGN FOR THE SHOPPING CENTER? IS THAT A DIFFERENT SITUATION? LIKE, THEY CAN'T HAVE MULTIPLE SIGNS FOR THE BUSINESS LIKE OUT FRONT AT THE SHOPPING CENTER AND ON THE ACTUAL BUSINESS.
00:47:28.353: >> THE SIGN AREA IS FOR THE TOTAL OF ALL THE SIGNS AND SO THIS IS A PROVISION WHERE YOU COULD HAVE MORE THAN ONE SIGN FOR A BUSINESS DEPENDING ON HOW YOU BREAK IT -- HOW BIG THOSE INDIVIDUAL SIGNS ARE.
00:47:44.569: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: I GUESS I'M THINKING BUSINESS CLUTTER, ABOVE THE DOOR OR WHATEVER HAS THE SIGN, BUT THEN THERE'S FIVE INSTANCES IN THE SHOPPING CENTER, WOULD THEY EACH BE ALLOWED TO HAVE THEIR OWN SIGN --
00:47:56.447: >> FREE STANDING SIGNS.
00:47:58.883: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: JUST ONE?
00:48:00.518: >> MM-HMM.
00:48:00.818: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: OKAY. PERFECT. THANK YOU.
00:48:05.656: >> Chair Milshteyn: FURTHER DISCUSSION? SO WE ARE READY FOR THE VOTE. ALL OF THOSE IN FAVOR, PLEASE SAY AYE. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
00:48:17.602: >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IT'S BEEN VERY NICE WORKING WITH YOU ON THIS PROJECT.
00:48:21.305: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU. MOVING ON TO AMENDMENTS TO CHAPTER 55 UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE, SECTION 5.18.6, PREMIUMS. WE WILL BEGIN WITH A STAFF REPORT FROM MR. LENART.
00:48:44.695: >> Planning Manager:  IN ONE MOMENT.
00:49:05.850: >> Commissioner Briggs: I KNOW THIS IS UNUSUAL -- COULD I MAKE A COMMENT BASED ON THE LAST ITEM EVEN THOUGH WE CLOSED DISCUSSION ON IT?
00:49:14.492: >> Chair Milshteyn: SURE. VERY BRIEFLY. BRIG WE NEVER ADDRESSED CAROL'S COMMENT. I WANTED TO SAY THAT YOUR COMMENT IS ADDRESSED IN THE LIGHTING COMMENT. KAREN, SORRY. THAT'S ALL I WANTED TO SAY. THANK YOU.
00:49:30.975: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU HAVE. MR. LENART.
00:49:33.911: >> Planning Manager:  OKAY. SO THIS IS PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO SECTION 5.18.6. I GREW THE PACKET FROM 15 TO 20 PAGES. DON'T FRET. I DON'T THINK IT'S OVERLY COMPLICATED. I WILL WALK IT THROUGH YOUR BENEFIT AND THE BENEFIT OF ANYBODY HERE. AS A REMINDER IN MARCH OF THIS YEAR, THE CITY COUNCIL DIRECTED THE PLANNING COMMISSION AND THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR TO EVALUATE CHANGES TO THE DOWNTOWN PREMIUMS WITH THE GOAL OF REALIZING MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. YOU WILL RECALL THAT WE HAVE FOR SOMETIME HAD AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING PREMIUM OPTION AVAILABLE TO DOWNTOWN DEVELOPMENT UNTIL RECENTLY IT HAS NEVER BEEN PROPOSED FOR ANY PROJECTS, AND HAS STILL NEVER BEEN IN -- INCORPORATED IN ANY APPROVED PROJECT TO DATE. WE HAD THE -- THE PLANNING COMMISSION HAS HAD A COUPLE OF DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THIS AT DIFFERENT LEVELS AT OUR WORKING SESSION, THE ORDINANCE REVISION COMMITTEE AND IN JUNE OF THIS YEAR WHERE NUMEROUS QUESTIONS CAME UP. WE RESPONDED TO SOME OF THOSE QUESTIONS FIRST IN OUR WORKING SESSION. WE ALSO PRESENTED THE RESULTS OF SOME OF THOSE CHANGES TO THE HOUSING AND HUMAN SERVICES ADVISORY BOARD HERE AT THE CITY, AND HERE -- THAT BRINGS US TO TONIGHT RECONSIDERING THE PROPOSED CHANGES HOPEFULLY IN RESPONSE FOR YOUR RECOMMENDATION TO CITY COUNCIL OR CERTAINLY POSTPONING IF YOU INTO EDNEY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. -- IF YOU NEED ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. SO TO HIGHLIGHT THE PROPOSED CHANGES, WE ARE PROPOSING TO CHANGE WHAT IS NOW TWO PREMIUMS, A RESIDENTIAL USE PREMIUM AND HOUSING PREMIUM INTO A SINGLE AFFORDABLE RESIDENTIAL UNIT PREMIUM OPTION. AND THE CURRENT -- AS CURRENTLY CONSTRUCTED IN THE ORDINANCE, WE PROVIDE SOME FLOOR AREA RATIO BENEFIT IN THESE DISTRICTS JUST FOR PROVIDING ANY RESIDENTIAL, REGARDLESS OF THE RENT OR -- WITHOUT ANY REQUIREMENTS OF INCOME TARGETING FOR ANY LOW-INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. THIS WOULD CHANGE THAT TO SAY THAT WHEN YOU ARE PROVIDING RESIDENTIAL, YOU WILL GAIN PREMIUM FLOOR AREA IN BOTH THE D1 AND D2 DISTRICT, ABOUT THE A PORTION OF THAT HAS TO BE DEDICATED TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SO CURRENTLY -- AND BOTH OF THE D1 AND D2, YOU CAN TYPICALLY GET TO THE APARTMENT FLOOR AREA RATIOS OF -- MAX FLOOR AREA RATIOS OF 700% IN THE D2, AND LARGELY JUST PROVIDING RESIDENTIAL AND MEETING, OF COURSE THE BASE LINE ENERGY EFFICIENCY STANDARDS REQUIRED. CURRENTLY IN THE D1 WITH PROVIDE A SUPER PREMIUM UP TO 900% F.A.R. THAT'S A PRETTY COMPLEX FORMULA THAT ALSO REQUIRES SOME LEVEL OF UNITS DEDICATED TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THIS WOULD CHANGE THAT TO SAY THAT YOU GET -- THERE'S NO CHANGE TO THE QUOTE/UNQUOTE BUY RIGHT BASE LEVEL OF DEVELOPMENT. IN THE D2, THAT MEANS UP TO 200% FLOOR AREA RATIO AND IN THE D1, THAT MEANS UP TO 400% FLOOR AREA RATIO, BUT UNDER THIS PREMIUM, THE FIRST THRESHOLD WOULD BE THAT YOU WOULD GET A BONUS OF 150% FLOOR AREA. THAT HAS ROUGHLY EQUIVALENT, OBVIOUSLY TO 4.5 IN THE D1 AND 100% IN THE D2, IF 15% OF RESIDENTIAL FLOOR AREA IS DEDICATED TO AFFORDABLE UNITS. THAT FLOOR AREA RATIO INCREASES TO 300% AMID THE D1 AND 200% OF THE D2, IF YOU ALLOCATE 20% OF RESIDENTIAL FLOOR AREA TO AFFORDABLE UNITS AND IT INCREASES TO 500% IN THE D1 AND NOT APPLICABLE TO THE D2 IF YOU DEDICATE TO AFFORDABLE FLOOR UNITS. THAT -- CORRESPONDINGLY, THOSE FIRST TWO ARE EQUIVALENT TO THE CURRENT 400 AND 700% FLOOR AREA RATIOS IN THOSE DISTRICTS, AND THE 30% WOULD BE EQUIVALENT TO THE 900% FLOOR AREA RATIO IN THE D1 DISTRICTS. IN ALL OF THESE CASES, THAT FLOOR AREA MUST BE A -- ADDITIONAL FLOOR AREA MUST BE USED FOR RESIDENTIAL. YOU RECALL THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE TOPICS THAT WE DISCUSSED AT THE FIRST REVIEW IS ENSURING THAT -- THAT WHEN WE ARE PROVIDING A BENEFIT FOR THIS IN THE FLOOR AREA, THAT THERE'S A POTENTIAL BENEFIT, RATHER THAN ALLOCATING A RATHER SMALL PORTION OF FLOOR AREA TO THE RES RESIDENTIALLY FOR THE SAKE OF THE FLOOR AREA. THAT'S THE POTENTIAL OF THE FIRST STANDARD? EACH OF THOSE. ADDITIONALLY IN TRYING TO FIND THE BALANCE OF REALIZING UNITS, AS WELL AS SUPPORTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF UNITS PERHAPS ELSEWHERE IN THE CITY. EACH THRESHOLD PROVIDES THAT HALF OF THE UNIT HAVE TO BE PROVIDED ON SITE. AND HALF OF THE UNITS COULD BE SUPPORTED BY PAYMENT IN LIEU OPTION. IN THE 900 -- THE 30% AMENITY AND 900% F.A.R. IN THE D1, WE ARE PROPOSING A HEIGHT DIFFERENCE TO PROVIDE THOSE DEVELOPERS WITH MORE FLEXIBILITY TO ACHIEVE THAT FULL FLOOR AREA RATIO WHICH SOMETIMES CAN BE CHALLENGING RIGHT NOW WITH THE CONVERGENCE OF OUR FLOOR AREA RATIO LIMITS AND HEIGHT LIMITS IN SOME OF OUR CHARACTER DISTRICTS. AS INDICATED, THE PAYMENT IN LIEU OPTION THAT WOULD APPLY TO HALF OF THOSE UNITS WOULD BE BASED ON AN AMOUNT ESTABLISHED BY CITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION. YOU WILL SEE ONCE WE HIGHLIGHT THE CHANGES THAT WERE PROPOSING SHIFTING FROM A PER UNIT CONTRIBUTION TO A MORE SQUARE FOOT CONTRIBUTION. THAT WAS SOMETHING ELSE WE TALKED ABOUT. WE WOULD BE SETTING THE EXPECTATION THAT THESE UNITS BE MAINTAINED ON SITE FOR 99 YEARS. WE ARE PROPOSING THAT NO OFF-STREET PARKING WOULD BE REQUIRED FOR DWE DWELLING UNITS. CURRENTLY NO PARKING IS REQUIRED IN THE BASE AREA. YOU HAVE TO PARK IT AT A RATE OF 1,000 PER SQUARE FEET. UNDER THIS CHANGE, YOU WOULD NOT HAVE TO COUNT THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS IN THAT PARKING CALCULATION. AND THEN FINALLY, WE ARE PROPOSING A PENALTY THAT IN THE TIME, IF THE EXPECTATION IS SET, THROUGH AN AFFORDABILITY AGREEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT FOR 99 YEARS, AND THAT'S NOT REALIZED, IT WOULD BE AI VIOLATION OF THIS ORDINANCE AND IT WOULD REQUIRE A PENALTY OF FIVE TIMES THE CURRENT CONTRIBUTION, AND THAT'S ON A PER SQUARE FOOT BASIS. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT REALLY IS -- THE MAJOR THING THAT SPARKED THE CHANGE TO THE EXPANSION OF PROPOSED ORDINANCE IN FRONT OF YOU IS CHANGING THE DEFINITION IN THE U.D.C. CURRENTLY THE DEFINITION REFERS TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR LOW-INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. WE'RE PROPOSING TO STREAMLINE THAT TO JUST DEFINE IT AS AFFORDABLE HOUSING DWELLING UNITS AND THE PROPOSED DEFINITION THAT YOU HAVE HERE IS ALSO A DEAF ANYTHING RECOMMENDED BY THE HOUSING AND HUMAN SERVICES ADVISORY BOARD, CLARIFYING THAT WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING DWELLING UNITS, WE MEAN THOSE DWELLING UNITS IDENTIFIED IN CITY PLANNING DOCUMENTS AS THE MOST URGENT NEED. SO CURRENTLY THE DEFINITION REFERENCES HOUSEHOLDS BELOW 80% OF MEDIAN INCOME. THE CITY HAS A SPECIFIC GOAL FOR THOSE 60% BELOW MEDIAN INCOME. AND THE FORMER DEFINITION ALSO HAD A QUALIFIER THAT SAID THAT IN ADDITION THOSE HOUSEHOLDS ARE NOT PAYING MORE THAN 30% OF THEIR GROSS INCOME. THAT IS A GREAT STANDARD FOR HOUSING SECURITY, HOWEVER, IT'S REALLY CHALLENGING FOR DEVELOPERS TO PROGRAM THEIR UNITS WHEN YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THAT RENT MIGHT BE, BASED ON THE PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THAT HOUSEHOLD. WE'RE PROPOSING TO SHIFT THAT TO SIMPLY SAY THESE UNITS WOULD BE TARGETED FOR THOSE AT OR BELOW THE MEDIAN INCOME THAT'S DEFINED BY THE HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND IT'S PAID AT H.U.D. RATES. AGAIN, THEY ARE REGULAR NUMBERS THAT H.U.D. PUBLISHES ON A REGULAR BASIS. WITH THAT CHANGE OF DEFINITION, WE REFERENCE THE OLD DEFINITION THROUGH SEVERAL PLACES IN THE U.D.C. AND THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE SEEN IN THE REVISED VERSION THAT HAS BEEN PROVIDED. AND THE PLAN UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT, THE MIXED USE ZONING DISTRICTS, APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS, DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS, AND PLANNED PROJECT MODIFICATIONS, ALL OF THESE SECTIONS, WE HAVE MADE MORE SPECIFIC REFERENCE TO THE NEW TERM AFFORDABLE HOUSING DWELLING UNITS RATHER THAN THE PREVIOUS DEFINITION. SPECIFICALLY WITHIN THE PLANNING UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT, WE HAVE NOT CHANGED THE CALCULATION IN THE PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT WHICH IS STILL ON A PER DWELLING UNIT BASIS. HOWEVER, WHAT WE HAVE DONE IS WE HAVE ADDED THAT WHEN THE PUD IS EXCEEDING F.A.R., UNDER THE BASIS OF THE ZONING DISTRICT, THE SAME THRESHOLDS WILL APPLY FOR ACQUIRING AFFORDABLE UNITS AT THE CORRESPONDING PERCENTAGES AS WOULD APPLY IF YOU WERE COMING FROM A BASE RESIDENTIAL UNIT REQUIREMENT. AND WE ALSO SAID IN THAT CASE BECAUSE THEY ARE BEING COUNTED ON A PER UNIT BASIS, WE WILL USE THE AVERAGE SIZE OF ALL THE UNITS IN THE DEVELOPMENT FOR THE PURPOSES OF CALCULATING WHAT THE SIZE OF THOSE UNITS WOULD BE, AND THAT WOULD THEN TRANSPOND -- CORRESPOND TO THE SQUARE FOOTAGE PACAGE AS FAR AS WHAT THE PAYMENT IN LIEU WOULD BE, THIS IS THE SAME EXAMPLE THAT YOU HAVE SEEN IN NUMEROUS TIMES AT THIS POINT REFLECTING SORT OF HOW THE STACKING OF DIFFERENT -- THESE DIFFERENT PREMIUMS WOULD APPLY. INCLUDING OBVIOUSLY WITH THE 900% F.A.R., THE POTENTIAL FOR AN ADDITIONAL HEIGHT LIMIT OF -- DEPENDING ON WHAT THE NORMAL MAXIMUM HEIGHT LIMIT WAS OF THAT BASE DISTRICT. SO A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT I WOULD LIKE TO DRAW ATTENTION TO IN THIS CONTEXT IS CERTAINLY THE PREMIUMS IS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CHANGE. I THINK THAT WARRANTS ATTENTION TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S REFLECTING THE DISCUSSION THAT YOU -- THAT WE HAVE HAD. A COUPLE OF OTHER ASPECTS OF THIS PROPOSED ORDINANCE IS IN THE APPLICATION PROCESS, WE PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR WHEN A DEVELOPMENT INCLUDES A FORBEARANCE TO SEEK A REDUCTION IN THEIR FEE COSTS THAT REQUIRES APPROVAL BY CITY COUNCIL. WE HAVE INCLUDED IN THIS, THAT BROADLY, SO IT COULD POTENTIALLY APPLY TO PROJECTS IN THE DOWNTOWN, FOR EXAMPLE. I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT WAS THE ORIGINAL INTENT. I THINK PROBABLY THE ORIGINAL INTENT WAS TARGETED TO NONPROFIT HOUSING PROVIDERS THAN FOR-PROFIT HOUSING PROVIDERS. IT WILL HAVE AN IMPACT. IT WILL BE UP TO THE DISCRETION OF CITY COUNCIL TO DETERMINE WHEN APPROPRIATE AND WHEN NOT. THAT'S SOMETHING I WOULD DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO, AND THEN THE OTHER ASPECT CERTAINLY THE WAY WE ARE LOOKING AT THE P.U.D., THAT SEEMS LIKE A REASONABLE TRANSLATION OF THE EXISTING STRUCTURE, AND THE CONTEXT OF A PER SQUARE FOOT ANALYSIS, AND THEN FINALLY, TYPICALLY, I THINK WHEN THIS IS ENACTED AND HOW THIS IS TRANSITIONED IS GOING TO BE OF SIGNIFICANCE. THIS WILL BE A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE TO PRODUCTS THAT PEOPLE ARE EITHER CONSIDERING OR HAVE FRANKLY STARTED THE REVIEW PROCESS OF, FROM A -- FROM A SIMPLE PERSPECTIVE, ANY PROJECT THAT'S APPROVED THAT THE CITY HAS TO MEET THE ORDINANCES AT THE TIME. IF YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS, I WOULD CERTAINLY WELCOME THOSE. THAT WILL BE A DETERMINATION OF CITY COUNCIL, BUT IF YOU HAVE THOUGHTS ABOUT WHETHER THIS SHOULD FOLLOW ANY DIFFERENT PROCESS FOR ENACTING TIME PERIOD-WISE, THEN ANY OTHER TYPICAL ORDINANCE WOULD. AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS.
01:02:06.063: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU. AT THIS I AM TOO, I WOULD LIKE TO OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING FOR ANY MEMBERS OF THE AUDIENCE WHO WISH TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION IN REGARDS TO THIS ITEM. PLEASE, IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN ADDRESSING THE PLANNING COMMISSION, PLEASE STEP UP TO THE PODIUM AND STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS FOR THE RECORD. YOU WILL HAVE UP TO THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
01:02:29.353: >> HELLO. MY NAME IS CHRIS LeVOY. I'M A RESIDENT OF BLOOMFIELD HILLS, MICHIGAN, A FORMER STUDENT AT U OF M AND DO A LOT OF WORK IN ANN ARBOR FOR CVRE. THANK YOU FIRST OF ALL FOR THE TIME. I BRIEFLY WANTED TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE NEGATIVE EXTERNALITIES THAT MAY COME WITH THIS PROPOSAL. SO THE NEED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN ANN ARBOR OR ANY CITY FOR THAT MATTER IS CERTAINLY IMPORTANT, BUT OUR FEAR IS THAT THE PROPOSAL COULD BE DISCOURAGING TO THE INDUSTRY, THAT THE CITY IS RELYING UPON TO PROVIDE THE AFFORDABLE DWELLING UNITS AND BEAR THE COST. BOTH THEORETICAL AND IMPEERAL R. FROM THE GROUNDED SOLUTIONS RESEARCH WHO ARE EXPERTS IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING POLICY ACROSS THE COUNT ELECTRIC I, SUGGESTS THAT SHORT-TERM COSTS WITH AFFORDABLE HOUSING REGULATION ARE BORNE BY THE DEVELOPERS BUT THE LONG-RUN COSTS ARE ACTUALLY PASSED ON TO CURRENT LANDOWNERS. SO WITHOUT PROPER INCENTIVES A REGULATORY PROPOSAL, ESSENTIALLY ONLY TARGETS THE ONE INDUSTRY THAT IS NECESSARY FOR THE PROPOSAL'S SUCCESS. THE PROPOSAL MAY ALSO HURT THE CURRENT YOUNG PROFESSIONAL RESIDENTS OF THE DOWNTOWN AREA. FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN BOULDER, COLORADO, IMPLEMENTED A VERY SIMILAR PROPOSAL, DOWNTOWN DEVELOPMENT SLOWED, AND AS A RESULT, THE RELATIVE DIRTH OF AFFORDABLE UNITS ACTUALLY REMAINED FOR QUITE SOMETIME. AND THE EXISTING HOUSING RATE LAGGED BEHIND THE STRONG DEMAND FROM YOUNG PROFESSIONALS TO LIVE IN THE DOWNTOWN NEIGHBORHOOD. SO THE EVERYDAY YOUNG 20-SOMETHING-YEAR-OLD EMPLOYEE WAS ACTUALLY PRICED OUT OF THE MARKET. SO THE BOULDER EXPERIMENT ACTUALLY WIDENED THE WEALTH GAP DOWNTOWN, AND CREATED BARRIERS FOR THE EVERYDAY YOUNG PROFESSIONAL. IF THIS WERE THE RESULT IN ANN ARBOR, THEN COMMUTING WOULD BE THE OPTION, ADDING TO TRAFFIC AND POTENTIALLY POLLUTON AND INCREASING THE PARKING NEED THAT IS ALREADY AN ISSUE DOWNTOWN AND IT MAY HAVE FURTHER NEGATIVE EFFECTS. THEY ARE SAYING THAT RETAIL FOLLOWS ROOFTOPS. IN THE DOWNTOWN POPULATION THAT ALSO SUPPORTS THE RETAIL ENVIRONMENT IS PRICED OUT OF THE MARKET AND THE CITY CANNOT GROW AND FLOURISH, THESE LOCALLY OWNED BUSINESSES COULD CLOSE UP SHOP AND THIS COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE CITY'S ABILITY TO ADD AFFORDABLE HOUSING STOCK IN THE FUTURE. IF RETAIL SLOWS, AND  JOBS MAY E LOST, AND LOOKING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE CITY. SO DEVELOPERS AND REALTORS WANT TO SEE ANN ARBOR GROW AND BE A PART OF THE CULTIVATION OF THE COMMUNITY. WE BELIEVE THIS NEEDS TO BE A PROGRAM BASED ON INCENTIVES LIKE EXPEDITED APPROVAL PROCESSES, MAYBE TAX ABATEMENTS AND ASSISTED FUNDING OPTIONS RATHER THAN REGULATION IN ORDER TO KEEP ANN ARBOR ON THE PATH OF GROWTH AND PROVIDE ARE THE DESIRED AND NECESSARY AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS IN DOWNTOWN. THANK YOU.
01:05:34.938: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU.
01:05:37.908: >> GOOD EVENING I MY NAME IS LUKE BONNER WITH THE BONNER BUDGET GROUP. I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF MY CLIENT, LANDMARK DEVELOPMENT GROUP, HAD WHO HAS THE CORNER OF WILLIAM AND MAIN UNDER CONTRACT. IT'S THE D.T.E. OFFICE BUILDING. MY REQUEST IN THIS PROCESS, BECAUSE LANDMARK HAS ALREADY SUBMITTED SITE PLANS TO THE CITY, WE HAVE GONE THROUGH THE CITIZEN PARTICIPATION MEETING, ACTUAL SEVERAL AND WE PROBABLY HAD SEVEN OR EIGHT MEETINGS OFFICIALLY, AND UNOFFICIALLY. WE HAVE ALSO GONE THROUGH DESIGN REVIEW BOARD AND HAVE HAD SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF CHANGES SUGGESTED BY STAFF AT WHICH POINT WE ARE NOW GOING THROUGH, I WOULD SAY PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES, DESIGN CHANGES TO THE PROJECT. THIS CONVERSATION HAS NEVER COME UP WITH ANY CONVERSATIONS THAT WE HAD WITH CITY STAFF. AND SO THEREFORE, I WOULD JUST RECOMMEND THAT FOR PEOPLE THAT HAVE GONE THROUGH A PRETTY LENGTHY PROCESS OF MEETINGS WITH STAFF AND RESIDENTS AND OTHER BOARDS LIKE THE DESIGN REVIEW BOARD THAT THOSE ARE ALLOWED TO PROCEED AS THEY WERE ORIGINALLY EXTENDED. SUBMITTED. SO THAT'S MY REQUEST THIS EVENING. THANKS.
01:06:53.950: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU.
01:06:58.188: >> GOOD EVENING, MY NAME IS SHANNON. WE ARE BASED OUT OF BINGHAM FARMS, MISCHISH MANY. MICHIGAN. THERE ARE TWO PROJECTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN THAT LINE THAT ARE ACTUALLY UTILIZING THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING PREMIUM OPTION, IT'S IT IS CURRENTLY PRESENTED. WE WOULD ALSO REQUEST AS WELL THAT THOSE PROJECTS CURRENTLY IN THE -- IN PROCESS SINCE WE AS DEVELOPERS HAVE TO EXTEND A LOT OF COST IN REGARDS TO ACQUISITION AND IN REGARD TO DESIGN AND ALL OF THAT, THAT THEY HAVE THE RULES CHANGED TO US MIDGAME OR TOWARDS THE END OF THE PROCESS ISN'T REALLY FAR TO US AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CANNOT REALLY PLAN FOR THAT AS WE GO THROUGH THE PROCESS. I'M LOOKING FOR A COUPLE OF CLARIFICATIONS AS WELL IN REGARDS TO THE ORDINANCE AS IT'S CURRENTLY PRESENTS. ONE, CURRENTLY, THE UNIT HAS TO BE 600 SQUARE FEET. IF MY UNDERSTANDING OF THIS IS CORRECT BECAUSE IT'S CHANGED TO A SQUARE FOOTAGE SIZE, IT'S NOT DICTATING THE SIZE OF THAT UNIT, CORRECT? ALL RIGHT. GOOD. FURTHER MORE, I KNOW CITY COUNCIL WOULD EVENTUALLY, IF IT CAME TO IT DEFINE A PAYMENT IN LIEU OPTION. THIS IS BASED ON THE PER SQUARE FOOTAGE WAS IT STRICTLY TO PUD, BECAUSE I DID NOT SEE THAT WITHIN THIS CURRENTLY.
01:08:22.439: >> Chair Milshteyn: WE'LL DISCUSS THAT DURING OUR DISCUSSION.
01:08:25.308: >> OKAY. GREAT. REALLY THAT'S IT. I WOULD AGREE. SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU INTO ED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT IS THE LAND COST IS VERY EXPENSIVE. THE CITY FEES ARE VERY EXPENSIVE FOR WATER CONNECTIONS FOR BUILDING PERMITS AND THOSE TYPE OF THINGS. SO WHILE IT WILL GIVE US A BREAK ON THE APPLICATION FEE, THAT'S ONLY ONE VERY, VERY, VERY, MINOR, MINUSCULE AMOUNT OF FEES THAT WE HAVE TO PAY INTO THE SYSTEM, AND WITH THE CONSTRUCTION FEES THAT ARE EXCESSIVELY EXPENSIVE. A CHALLENGE TO IMPLEMENT UNDER THE CURRENT MODEL. THIS MAKES IT EVEN MORE CHALLENGING. THANK YOU.
01:09:04.080: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU.
01:09:16.760: >> HI, I'M A SUPERIOR TOWNSHIP RESIDENT AND OWN SEVERAL PROPERTIES IN ANN ARBOR. BASICALLY, THE WAY THAT I LOOK AT THIS, THIS IS NOT GOING TO SOLVE ANY ISSUE. IF TRULY THE CITY COUNCIL WANTS TO ADDRESS THE AFFORDABILITY. COMMISSIONER ALEX KNOWS THAT BETTER THAN ANYBODY. THE PROPERTY TAX IS $12,000. SO I RENTED FOR $1,500. I GET COMMITTED TO PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL IF I DO THAT. YOU GO TO $3,000 A MONTH, STILL FOUR MONTH GROSS RENT GOES TO PROPERTY TAX. NOW WE GO WITH THIS PLAN, THE PROPERTY TAX OF THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS NOT GOING TOEVER COULD THE RENT FOR THE FULL YEAR? WHAT DO WE DO? WE HAVE TO PASS AROUND TO THE OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE AFFORDABLE. SO WHAT WILL HAPPEN? THE PRICE WILL GO UP CONSIDERABLY. THE PEOPLE WORKING IN ANN ARBOR CANNOT AFFORD TO LIVE IN ANN ARBOR. THEY HAVE TO COMMUTE. ONLY CERTAIN PEOPLE CAN AFFORD TO LIVE IN ANN ARBOR. ONCE THIS THING HAPPENS. ARE A ETHER THAN DOING -- RATHER THAN DOING, THIS THE PREMIUM SHOULD BE GIVEN SO THAT THERE'S A SUPPLY. AND THEN ONCE THERE'S A SUPPLY, SUPPLY AND DEMAND AND THEN THE TAX ASSESSOR SHOULD TIE THE REPRESENT -- THEY SHOULD PRY THE PROPERTY TAX TO THE RENT. IF YOU ARE PAYING MORE THAN THREE MONTHS IN GROSS RENT -- OF YOUR GROSS RENT FOR PROPERTY TAX, YOU ARE IN RED. BECAUSE THERE IS MORTGAGE INVOLVED. THIS IS MATH 101. AND ONCE YOU PUT IT ON THE PAPER, YOU SEE THAT. I MEAN, IT CAN BE PERCEIVED, OH, THE RENTS ARE HIGH BECAUSE THE LANDLORDS ARE GREEDY. THAT'S NOT THE CASE. IT'S JUST THE NUMBERS. THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR TAXATION IS BASICALLY A KILLER OF THE WHOLE THINGS, IT'S DRIVING THE RENTS HIGH IN ORDER FOR THE PROPERTY TO MAKE MONEY. PEOPLE INVEST TO MAKE MONEY. NOBODY INVESTS JUST FOR THE SAKE OF OWNING IT. THE OTHER POINT THAT I WANT TO BRING UP, THERE ARE VERY FEW, LESS THAN A HANDFUL PARCELS LEFT IN D1 ZONING THAT IS NOT HISTORIC AND CAN GO UP. NO. NOW, IF THESE RESTRICTIONS ARE ADDED, PEOPLE CAN GO BY RIGHT. ONCE IT'S DONE, GUESS WHAT, THERE IS GOING TO BE A FOREVER SHORTAGE OF HOUSING AND WE ARE GOING TO HAVE MORE RENT THAN MANHATTAN IN HERE. WHICH IS NOT BAD FOR THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE HOUSES BUT SUCH IS THE TENANT. BUT THE CITY IS DRIVING TO THAT DIRECTION, THE WAY THAT I'M LOOKING AT IT. SO THANK YOU.
01:12:01.491: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION IN REGARDS TO THIS ITEM? SEEING NO ONE, I WILL READ THE MOTION. THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION HEREBY RECOMMENDS THAT THE MAYOR AND THE CITY COUNCIL APPROVE THE AUGUS AUGUST 2nd, 2019, DRAFTED AMENDMENTS TO CHAPTER 55, UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE SECTIOO INCENTIVIZE AFFORDABLE DWELLING UNITS IN THE DOWNTOWN ZONING DISTRICTS AND RELATED U.D.C. REFERENCES. MOVED BY COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN, SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER MILLS. COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN.
01:12:37.093: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MR. CHAIR AND THANK YOU TO STAFF'S WORK IN THE INTERIM. IT FEELS VERY RESPONSIVE. I DO STILL HAVE SOME QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS AND FEEDBACK. BUT I REALLY DO APPRECIATE THE WORK. THE -- FIRST OF ALL, T TYING TO THE FAIR MARKET RENT AND THE A.M.I., IT'S FAIR AND PREDICTABLE AND IN LINE WITH OUR OBJECTIVES AND GOALS THAT WE STATE AS A CITY. THAT'S GREAT. ALSO THE INCLUSION OF TAXES AND COMMUNITIES. AND THEY KNOW WHAT THEY ARE GETTING AS WELL. SO I APPRECIATE THAT CHANGE. I WANT TO ASK BROADLY A QUESTION ABOUT THE PAYMENT IN LIEU. CAN YOU DISCUSS A LITTLE BIT ABOUT CHANGES THAT MAY BE IN THE WORKS AND HOW THEY ARE GOING TO AFFECT THE CALCULATIONS HERE OR IF THEY ARE GOING TO AFFECT THE CALCULATIONS HERE?
01:13:39.088: >> Planning Manager:  YES. SO THE HOUSING AND HUMAN SERVICES ADVISORY BOARD HAS -- LET ME BACK UP. THERE'S NUMEROUS REFERENCES IN THE U.D.C. TO A PAYMENT IN LIEU AMOUNT ASSOCIATED WITH AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THAT IS CURRENTLY MEASURED ON I APER UNIT BASIS. CURRENTLY THAT NUMBER, I THINK, IS ABOUT $93,000 PER UNIT. IT DOESN'T -- IT DOESN'T DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN AN EFFICIENCY UNIT AND A THREE BEDROOM UNIT. IT'S $93,000 PER UNIT. AND SO IN THE CONTEXT OF THAT AND RECOGNIZING THAT EVEN IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE, IT MIGHT BE MORE APPROPRIATE THAT THAT CALCULATION SORT OF CONTRACT AND EXPAND AS THE TYPES OF UNITS THAT ARE IN PLAY, THE HOUSING AND HUMAN SERVICES ADVISORY BOARD IS RECOMMENDING A SHIFT TO A PER SQUARE FOOT CALCULATION. THAT IS GOING. I THINK THAT'S BEEN INTRODUCED TO -- INTO PROPOSAL AN UPCOMING CITY COUNCIL AGENDA. PERHAPS LATER THIS MONTH. AND SO THAT IS -- THAT IS ALSO CONSISTENT WITH SOME OF THE CONVERSATION THAT HAPPENED AROUND THIS TABLE ABOUT THE APPLICATION OF PREMIUMS. I THINK THERE WAS A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT CONCERNS AND CONSTRAINTS ABOUT TRYING TO WRITE LANGUAGE AROUND THE SIZE OF UNITS. HOW WOULD THE SIZE AFTER FORWARDABLE UNITS -- WHAT IF ALL WERE EFFICIENCY FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSE AND THERE WERE THREE BEDROOMS. THIS GROUP HAD NUMEROUS OPINIONS ON THAT. WHAT WE HEARD FROM THAT AT THE END OF THAT IS LET'S -- LET'S JUST TALK ABOUT IT MORE BROADLY FROM AN ALLOCATED SQUARE FOOTAGE OF THE BUILDING TO RESIDENTIAL USES AND PROVIDE THE SAME FLEXIBILITY, HOWEVER THAT FELLER WANTS TO ALLOCATE THOSE SPACES FOR MARKET RATE OR AFFORDABLE, WE DON'T REALLY CARE. THAT'S WHY WE ALSO DID REMOVE THE 600 SQUARE FOOT MINIMUM REQUIREMENT. WE HAVE BASIC BUILDING COLD BUIE REQUIREMENTS. WE DIDN'T THINK IT WAS IMPORTANT TO CELT A FLOOR FOR THIS PURPOSE. SO -- SET A FLOOR FOR THIS PURPOSE. SO IN THE WORKS IS TO SHIFT THAT CALCULATION, PRESENT IT TO CITY COUNCIL FOR PRESENTATION THAT PER SQUARE FOOTAGE BASIS GIVES US MORE FLEXIBILITY FOR VARYING UNIT TYPES AND VARYING UNIT SIZES AND CERTAINLY THE PROPOSED CHANGES HERE. THAT CHANGE, AGAIN, WOULD BE VERY COMPATIBLE WITH HOW THE PREMIUMS ARE WORDED IN THIS PROPOSAL. IT'S NOT QUITE AS IN LINE WITH THE PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT. IN THE CASE OF PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT, WE WILL STILL MEASURE IT WHEN IT'S A RESIDENTIAL DENSITY OF X UNITS PER ACRE AND YOU WANT TO DO Y UNITS PER ACRE, WE WILL STILL LET THAT LANGUAGE AND CALCULUS ASUPPAPPLY, BUT FOR TRANSFERRINT PER UNIT SQUARE FOOT COST TO A UNIT, WE WILL AVERAGE SIZE THE UNITS IN THE RESIDENTIAL UNIT. .THAT'S WHERE THE CALCULATION WILL COME FROM.
01:17:13.836: >> Councilmember Ackerman: OKAY. SO WITH THE AVERAGE OF THE UNIT SIZE FOR THE ENTIRE DEVELOPMENT BEING USED AS THE FACTOR. CAN THE UNIT SIZE OF THE DEVELOPMENT CHANGE THROUGH THE PROCESS AND EAST EVEN POST APPR.
01:17:39.295: >> Planning Manager:  YEAH.
01:17:40.329: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  SO AT WHAT POINT IN TIME ARE WE GOING TO DO THAT CALCULATION?
01:17:46.269: >> Planning Manager: TYPICALLY PRIOR TO THE CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY. THAT'S THE SNAPSHOT IN TIME WHEN WE LOOK AT THAT.
01:17:56.012: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  SO WE MAY HAVE A GOOD IDEA OF WHAT THE CONTRIBUTION TO THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUND WOULD BE BUT IT WON'T BE EXACT UNTIL ALL THE PERMITTING IS DONE AND WE ARE READY TO RELEASE THE C.O.O.?
01:18:12.528: >> Planning Manager:  YES. WHEN THE UNITS ARE PROVIDED, BASED ON VERY SPECIFIC AMOUNTS. SO UNLESS THOSE AGREEMENTS WERE TO COME BACK TO CITIES -- LIKE, FOR EXAMPLE, IF CITY COUNCIL WERE TO DO A FEE IN LIEU, AND THAT'S BASED ON THE CURRENT CONFIGURATION OF THOSE UNITS. THAT WILL GET MEMORIALIZED IN A DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT THAT HAS TO BE EXECUTED AND COMPLIED WITH, PRIOR TO THE CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY BEING ISSUED FOR THAT. IT'S PROBABLY MORE LIKELY THEN THAT EVEN IF ANY CHANGE HAPPENS IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE, THAT AT THAT POINT WE SORT OF CONVERTED AMOUNT FROM THE FORMULA TO A FINANCIAL OBLIGATION OF A SET AMOUNT. I GUESS IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THOSE UNITS COULD BE RECONFIGURED IN SUCH A WAY THAT DON'T REQUIRE AMENDMENTS TO THE SITE PLAN. UNLESS THIS WAS A DESIRE TO COME BACK TO CITY COUNCIL AND AMEND THAT DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT, IT'S -- IT JUST SEEMS THAT THAT SNAPSHOT IS GOING TO HOLD. SO ANOTHER WAY TO SAY IT, I DON'T THINK IT WILL CHANGE MUCH BETWEEN APPROVAL AND OCCUPANCY, BUT THERE MAY BE SOME CONFIGURATION CHANGE THAT HAPPENS THAT WE WON'T REALIZE ANY PAYMENT FROM. I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY WHAT THE POTENTIAL SCENARIO-WISE, HOW THAT WOULD TRANSLATE TO THAT AVERAGE.
01:19:42.318: >> Councilmember Ackerman: OKAY.
01:19:45.154: >> Planning Manager:  I'M NOT ANSWERING YOUR QUESTION AT ALL.
01:19:47.189: >> Councilmember Ackerman: IT'S A LITTLE BIT LIKE WE WILL FIGURE IT OUT.
01:19:50.326: >> Planning Manager:  LET ME MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOUR QUESTION IS. IS YOUR CONCERN THAT THE AVERAGE UNIT SIZE IS 1,000 SQUARE FEET? AND THEY DO A PAYMENT IN LIEU BASED ON THAT CALCULUS? AND THEN WHAT'S YOUR CONCERN HOW THAT CHANGES, THAT THAT AVERAGE GOES DOWN TO 900 BECAUSE THEY ADD MORE UNITS?
01:20:21.457: >> Councilmember Ackerman: SURE. IN THAT CASE. IF WE CALCULATE THE PAYMENT IN LIEU, WHEN THE AVERAGE IS 1,000 FEET, AND WE CHARGE THEM THAT, AND THEN THEY MOVE IT DOWN TO 900, THEIR CONSIDERATION IS GOING TO BE GREATER THAN IT NEEDED TO BE?
01:20:40.376: >> Planning Manager:  YES, BUT AGAIN MY ASSUMPTION -- BUT MY ASSUMPTION IS AT THAT TIME, THEY HAVE A DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT THAT GOES AWAY FROM THE FORMULA. AND SAYS BASED ON THE APPROVED PLAN, YOUR CONTRIBUTION IS X. YOU HAVE TO MAKE THAT DISTRIBUTION PRIOR TO THE CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY. NOW THAT SAID, THEY COULD CHANGE IT ALL TO 1200 SQUARE FOOT UNITS BUT THAT'S A CHANGE THAT REQUIRES COUNCIL APPROVAL BECAUSE YOU ARE THE BODY THAT APPROVES DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS.
01:21:07.370: >> Councilmember Ackerman: UNDERSTOOD. I CAN APPRECIATE THAT. NEXT ONE I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT, TURNING TO THE TABLE -- I DON'T HAVE PAGE NUMBERS. I'M SORRY. IT'S TABLE 5-18-1, AFFORDABLE RESIDENTIAL UNIT PREMIUM. IT'S A MIXED USE DEVELOPER. THE DEVELOPER WILL ONLY BUILD THE MINIMUM NECESSARY -- EXCUSE ME, THE MINIMUM NECESSARY RESIDENTIAL AREA.
01:21:50.513: >> Planning Manager:  OKAY.
01:21:51.313: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  AS I DO THOSE CALCULATIONS, OPTION A, 15% AND I'M MAKING THE ASSUMPTION THAT THEY BUILD OUT TO THE PERIMETER OF THE PROPERTY. SO THE MINIMUM OF F.A.R. OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT THEY NODE TNEED TO BUILD IS A QUART E FLOOR. FOR OPTION B, IT'S ABOUT 60% OF THE FLOOR. THEN WHEN WE GET TO OPTION C, THE 30%, BECAUSE WE NOW LIMIT MINIMUM TO F.A. R., THE MINIMUM NECESSARY WOULD BE 70% OF THE FLOOR. SO THE MARGINAL BENEFIT THAT THE COMMUNITY GETS IS ONLY ABOUT, YOU KNOW, 15% OF THE FLOOR, BUT THE MARGINAL BENEFIT THAT THE DEVELOPER RECEIVES IN TERMS OF AN INCENTIVE IS AN ADDITIONAL 200F.A.R. AND I -- YOU KNOW, THAT'S MAKING SOME ASSUMPTIONS. BUT IT IT IS -- I GUESS MATH STS BEING LINEAR GOING FROM OPTION B TO C.
01:23:09.358: >> Planning Manager:  I GUESS IT REFLECTS THE OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES. YOU NEED TO ALLOCATE THE SAME AMOUNT TO RESIDENTIAL.
01:23:17.700: >> Councilmember Ackerman: IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A BAD THING. WE DO ALSO HAVE A SUPPLY ISSUE. WE HAVE MORE JOBS IN THIS COMMUNITY THAN WE HAVE PEOPLE. WE HAVEN'T BEEN BUILDING ENOUGH HOUSING TO KEEP UP, EVEN WITH INCREASES IN ENROLLMENT, NOT TO MENTION INCREASES IN U OF M EMPLOYMENT OR TECH INDUSTRY THAT'S GROWING HERE. YOU COULD LOOK AT IT AND SAY, OKAY, WELL, WE ARE GIVING A LITTLE BIT MORE NEXT TO THESE LARGER DEVELOPMENTS WHICH WILL BE INCREASING SUPPLY, AND THAT'S AN OKAY THING. THAT'S A DIFFERENT COMMUNITY BENEFIT. WE STILL WANT TO SEE THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WE STILL WANT SOME CASH FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. BUT WE'RE GOING TO PROVIDE SOME MORE FLEXIBILITY FOR THESE DENSER UNITS. LIKE, I'M -- I THINK I'M OKAY WITH THAT. I JUST -- YOU WANT TO STATE IT.
01:24:05.114: >> Planning Manager:  SKATED.
01:24:06.515: >> Councilmember Ackerman: COOL. STATED.
01:24:08.584: >> Planning Manager:  YEAH. YOU SUMMARIZED THIS. IT DOESN'T HAVE THAT SAME MINIMUM REQUIREMENT. THE 30% IS A REGULATOR IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE. YOU ARE RIGHT IN THIS CASE, YOU COULD POTENTIALLY -- YOUR RESIDENTIAL COULD BE A SMALLER PROPORTION OF THE OVERALL BUILDING. 30% OF WHATEVER THAT IS, IS STILL GOING TO BE AFFORDABLE.
01:24:33.042: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YEAH, OKAY. AND, AGAIN, YOU KNOW, IT'S BETTER THAN WHAT WE HAVE TODAY AND ONE BUILDING IS GOING TO BE CREATING, UNITS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE THE DAY BEFORE. SO I APPRECIATE THAT. SO YOU MENTIONED THE IDEA OF WAIVING FEES FOR THESE PRIVATE DEVELOPMENTS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED. I LOVE THE IDEA OF NONPROFIT DEVELOPERS GETTING THEIR FEES CUT IN HALF. I THINK THAT'S FANTASTIC. WE SHOULD HAVE DONE THAT A LONG TIME AGO.
01:25:08.510: >> Planning Manager:  AND WE DO DO THAT.
01:25:10.079: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU. I'M VERY INTERESTED IN DOING THAT HERE. I THINK IF WE CAN BRING DOWN SOFT COSTS THAT DEVELOPERS NEED TO UNDERTAKE EARLY IN THE PROCESS, WHEN THE RISK IS REALLY HIGH, I THINK THAT'S GOOD. I THINK IT GETS MORE PEOPLE LOOKING AT BUILDING IN, AGAIN -- YOU KNOW, WE STILL HAVE A GOOD AMOUNT OF DOWNTOWN REAL ESTATE TO BE DEVELOPED OR REDEVELOPED. BUT I THINK IT GETS -- I THINK IT STARTS THOSE PROCESSES. IT'S A LOWER BARRIER OF ENTRY AND I LIKE THAT. SO I THINK I WOULD BE SUPPORTIVE OF THAT, IF WE CAN CODIFY THAT, SOMEHOW THAT WOULD BE GOOD. THE -- IN A MODULAR WAY, IF THAT MAKES SENSE. IN A --
01:26:02.531: >> Planning Manager:  SO TO BE CLEAR, AS IT'S DRAFTED NOW, THAT POTENTIAL EXISTS NOR ANY PROJECT THAT IS PROVIDING # 60% A.M.I. UNITS TIED TO FAIR MARKET RUNS. SO ANY PROJECT THAT HAS THAT, HAS THE POTENTIAL NOW TO ASK -- SO TO WHAT YOU ARE SAYING, IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT EXTENDS TO THESE, THEN THE LANGUAGE AS PRESENTED WOULD ACHIEVE THAT.
01:26:25.487: >> Councilmember Ackerman: OKAY. SO THE PROCESS IS THAT ON AN AD HOC BASIS WE ARE WAIVING THESE FEES?
01:26:31.794: >> Planning Manager:  IT'S BY RESOLUTION OF CITY COUNCIL.
01:26:36.999: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  IS THERE A WAY TO STREAMLINE IT.
01:26:39.601: >> Planning Manager:  IT WOULD CHANGE THE AUTHORITY POWER FROM CITY COUNCIL TO SOMEBODY ELSE.
01:26:44.306: >> Councilmember Ackerman: CAN WE DO THAT?
01:26:46.375: >> Planning Manager:  THE CITY CAN ADOPT WHATEVER LANGUAGE --
01:26:49.912: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  IS IT IN THE U.D.C.?
01:26:52.081: >> Planning Manager:  IT'S IN THE U.D.C. IT'S ONLY APPLYING TO GO PLANNING FEES. I THINK IT'S A RELATIVELY SMALL CHUNK IN THAT -- THE OVERALL COST OF DEVELOPMENT. BUT TO YOUR POINT, IT IS AT THE FRONT END.
01:27:02.991: >> Councilmember Ackerman: RIGHT.
01:27:05.160: >> Planning Manager:  SO IT -- YES, WE COULD DEFINITELY EVALUATE SOME LANGUAGE THAT JUST PERHAPS AUTOMATICALLY PROVIDES IT THAT UPON APPROVAL OF A PROJECT THAT ACHIEVES AFFORDABLE DWELLING UNITS, 50% SHALL BE REVERSED, REIMBURSED OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. WE COULD LOOK AT THAT LANGUAGE.
01:27:22.177: >> Councilmember Ackerman: OKAY. SO IF IT'S A REIMBURSEMENT, IT'S NO LONGER EARLY IN THE PROCESS BECAUSE THEY STILL HAVE TO FRONT THE CRASH. SO I GUESS WHAT I'M -- I GUESS WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO IS INCENTIVIZE PEOPLE STARTING THIS PROCESS, AND WHEN RISKS ARE HIGH, MAKING THE CASH YOU HAVE TO PUT DOWN LOW. DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?
01:27:49.538: >> Planning Manager:  IT DOES, BECAUSE IF THE PROJECT IS NOT REALIZED, YOU WANT SOME TYPE OF -- THOSE COSTS ARE DONE ON THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS TO REVIEW PETITIONS. THE CITY PROACTIVELY ACKNOWLEDGING THAT POTENTIALLY REIMBURSES UP TO 50%. I -- WE CAN DEFINITELY EXPLORE CHANGING THE FRONT END OF THAT SO WE DON'T REQUIRE THAT. MY ONLY POINT IS IN THE CASE OF -- SAY THAT APPLICATION COMES IN AND FOR SOME REASON THE PROJECT IS NOT REALIZED, DOES THAT MATTER --
01:28:19.334: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YEAH, FAIR ENOUGH. IT'S TRULY BASED ON STAFF TIME AND WE ARE TRYING TO RECOUP THOSE COSTS AND IF IT ISN'T REALIZED THEN WHY WOULD WE GIVE SOME OF THE BENEFIT? THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE. IF WE COULD EXPLORE THEN THAT, I WOULD BE GRATEFUL. I DO APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS FROM SOME DEVELOPERS ABOUT PHASING THIS, ABOUT PROJECTS IN THE PROCESS. YOU KNOW, IF THERE'S ONE THING ABOUT THE REAL ESTATE INDUSTRY IS THAT CHANGING IN RULES CREATES UNPREDICTABILITY AND UNPREDICTABILITY RUINS OPPORTUNITY AND I THINK CHANGING RULES MIDPROCESS IS A LITTLE UNFAIR. THE -- SO I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN THAT. I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE BEST AND MOST FAIR CUTOFF IS BECAUSE AT SOME POINT, WE DO JUST NEED TO MOVE TO THIS AND NEW PROJECTS NEED TO GET ON BOARD. SHOULD IT BE PASSED. AN WITH FAVOR TO PROJECTS ALREADY IN PROCESS. AND THEN THE LAST PIECE IS WE DISCUSSED THIS SOME, BUT THE GENERAL RATIOS OF 15%, 20% AND 30%. I DON'T KNOW -- I FEEL LIKE YOU, MR. LENART, YOU GAVE A PRETTY GOOD DEFENSE OF THOSE NUMBERS LAST TIME WE SPOKE AND I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S NIL THOUGHT DEVELOPMENT OR CHANGE WITH RESPECT TO THAT, BUT --
01:30:00.502: >> Planning Manager:  NO, I MEAN, THEY START FROM A FLESH HOLD ESTABLISHED IN THE PUD ORDINANCE AND GO UP FROM THERE. YOU WILL FIND INCLUSIONARY ZONING ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN THESE BALLPARKS AS WELL.
01:30:20.689: >> Councilmember Ackerman: NOT THAT THIS IS INCLUSIONARY ZONING. THIS IS INCENTIVE BASED.
01:30:25.794: >> Planning Manager:  THIS IS INCENTIVE BASED.
01:30:30.232: >> Councilmember Ackerman: COOL.
01:30:30.999: >> CTHAT'S EVERYTHING FROM ME. I GUESS TO SUMMARIZE ANY DESIRED CHANGES I HAVE, THE APPROACH TO PHASING AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO WAIVE THE 50% OF FEES ON THE BACK END OF THE PROCESS IF AFFORDABLE UNITS ARE TRULY REALIZED. AND I GUESS ALSO WITH THE CAVEAT THAT THEY ARE INCLUDING THE -- I GUESS MOST OF THEM WOULD BE INCLUDING -- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. I'M GOOD. THAT'S ALL. ANY PROPOSED CHANGES BUT WE CAN COVER THOSE LATER, AND IF YOU FIGURE ON THE AMENDMENT I'M HAPPY TO MAKE IT, IF NOT, I'M HAPPY TO POSTPONE AND BRING IT BACK.
01:31:08.103: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER MILLS.
01:31:10.539: >> Vice Chair Mills: I JUST WANTED TO PICK UP ON SOMETHING THAT COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN JUST SAID, THIS IS AN INCENTIVE. THE -- YOU KNOW, IT'S CHANGING WHAT INCENTIVES ARE AVAILABLE, BUT THERE IS STILL BY RIGHT DEVELOPMENT THAT'S THERE. AND IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THIS -- IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE A HIGHER F.A.R., THIS IS NOT THE ONLY INCENTIVE. THERE'S STILL THE GREEN BUILDING INCENTIVES, YOU KNOW, PREMIUMS FOR PEDESTRIAN AMENITIES AND ALL OF THAT. SO I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S CLEAR BECAUSE THAT'S ONE OF THE COMMENTS THAT CAME UP AS WELL. I SHARE MOST OF WHAT COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN SAID, ACTUALLY ALL OF WHAT COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN SAID. I LIKE MOVING TO THE SQUARE FOOTAGE MEASUREMENT. I KNOW A LOT OF TIMES WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT UNITS, RIGHT, PREVIOUSLY, WE WERE TALKING ABOUT UNITS, WE NEEDED TO HAVE A MINIMUM -- THERE WAS A CONCERN OVER EXTREMELY SMALL AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS COMPARED TO EXTREMELY LARGE MARKET RATE UNITS. IS THERE ANY CONCERN OVER -- BECAUSE IT'S NOW SQUARE FOOTAGE AND IT'S CHEAPER TO BUILD BEDROOMS THAN IT IS TO BUILD A KITCHEN. IS THERE ANY CONCERN OVER THERE BEING JUST UNCONSCIONABLY LARGE AFFORDABLE UNITS?
01:32:37.826: >> Planning Manager:  SO PROPOSAL SAYS, NO. ANY WAY YOU DEDICATE THAT FLOOR AREA TO AFFORDABLE UNITS THAT IS UP TO YOU. I THINK THAT THEY ARE -- I THINK IT IS POSSIBLE, BUT I'M NOT SURE WHY THE MARKET WOULD NECESSARILY DRIVE IF YOU HAVE TO PROVIDE AFFORDABLE UNITS, I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU WOULD WANT TO DO A 12 BEDROOM AFFORDABLE UNIT. YOU KNOW, YOU WILL CITY WANT TO SECURE INCOME OUT OF THOSE. IT WILL BE AT A REDUCED RATE, BUT THERE'S STILL INCOME. I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU WOULD WANT TO CONFIGURE IT IN SUCH A WAY THAT WAS FINANCIALLY IMPRACTICAL.
01:33:23.672: >> Vice Chair Mills: WE HAVE ALWAYS TALKED ABOUT THE OPPOSITE, BUT THE CHEAPEST THING TO DO IS ADD ON A BEDROOM.
01:33:30.445: >> Planning Manager:  THAT DID COME UP A LOT IN DISCUSSION AND THAT FROM MY LENS IS THE INTERACTION OF THE AMENITY AND THOSE SPECIFIC STANDARDS. THAT'S 15% OF THE FLOOR AREA HAS TO BE AFFORDABLE UNITS AND IN THE CASE OF D1, AT LEAST 150% OF THE F.A.R. HAS TO BE DEDICATED RESIDENTIAL.
01:33:48.663: >> Vice Chair Mills: RIGHT.
01:33:49.264: >> Planning Manager:  THAT'S PUTTING SOME BASE LIMITERS TO AVOID -- I THINK ONE OF THE SCENARIOS, WHAT IF YOU ONLY PUT 1,000 SQUARE FEET IN RESIDENTIAL IN ONE CORNER AND SOMEHOW YOU GET ALL THE PREMIUMS? THIS IS PROVIDING A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY AND SORT OF A HANDS OFF APPROACH TO SAY WE DON'T CARE HOW YOU CONSIDER THAT SQUARE FOOTAGE BUT YOU HAVE TO DEDICATE A CERTAIN AMOUNT TO RESIDENTIAL IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THESE PREMIUMS AS THE OTHER PREMIUM DOES, AND YOU HAVE TO ACHIEVE THE AFFORDABLE AMENITY SIZE.
01:34:19.961: >> Vice Chair Mills: GOT IT. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE FEE REDUCTION. I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU FIRST OF ALL, EXPANDING THIS TO PULL THAT LANGUAGE IN, AS WELL AS TO INCLUDE THE PUD LANGUAGE, TO AGAIN, TRY TO STREAMLINE LIKE WE DID ON THE LAUGH THING THAT WE TALKED ABOUT MAKING THE SIGN ORDINANCE AND THE LIGHTING ORDINANCE MATCH UP, LIKE MAKING AFFORDABLE UNITS IN THE PREMIUMS DISCUSSION MATCH-UP WITH THE PUD DISCUSSION.
01:34:46.421: >> Planning Manager:  AND PLAN PROJECT.
01:34:49.090: >> Vice Chair Mills: AND PLANNED PROJECTS. YES, I ROO  APPRECIATE THAT. WHAT COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN POINTED OUT, SAYING THAT THIS CAN -- MAY BE REDUCED BY RESOLUTION OF CITY COUNCIL, DO YOU HAVE A SUGGESTION ABOUT HOW ELSE WE COULD WRITE THAT? ARE THERE OTHER THINGS THAT -- I SEE EARLIER ON THAT PAGE -- SO I'M ON PAGE -- OH, THERE ARE NO PAGES. WELL, WHATEVER. TEN MAYBE ISH. 12. I THINK IT'S PAGE 12, OF THE DOCUMENT. EARLIER ON THAT PAGE, IT TALKS ABOUT THE PLANNING MANAGER BEING ABLE TO DO SOMETHING AT THE END OF A. SO SHOULD WE SAY -- COULD WE RECOMMEND THE PLANNING MANAGER? IS THAT SOMETHING YOU WOULD BE WILLING TO DO?
01:35:36.404: >> Planning Manager:  OH, ABSOLUTELY. OR -- OR WE -- I WOULD SAY -- I'M NOT SURE -- THAT WOULD BE FINE. THE PLANNING MANAGER HAS PRESCRIBED AUTHORITIES. THIS COULD BE ONE OF THEM. I'M NOT SURE THAT'S WHAT I HEARD. I THINK -- I THINK I WAS HEARING MORE CONCERN ABOUT THE MAY. I THINK I WOULD PROBABLY APPROACH THIS TO BE MORE CLEAR TO SAY THAT IF THIS, THEN 50% OF THE FEES WILL BE REIMBURSED.
01:36:04.699: >> Vice Chair Mills: REIMBURSED.
01:36:05.400: >> Planning Manager:  SO WHETHER IT'S CITY COUNCIL, THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR OR THE CITY MANAGER, I WOULD SAY, IF YOU ACHIEVE THOSE NUMBERS, YOU WILL GET IT. I WOULD DESCRIBE CLEARLY UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS WILL THAT BE EXECUTED.
01:36:24.119: >> Vice Chair Mills: EXCELLENT. I THINK THAT WOULD BE AI GRAPH I AGREATCHANGE TO MAKE. I CAN WORK ON THAT IF WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THIS. THERE'S GENERAL SUPPORT.
01:36:34.362: >> Chair Milshteyn: IF I CAN JUMP IN VERY QUICKLY. WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT THE FEES? WHAT ARE THE -- HOUX -- ARE WE TALKING ABOUT A COUPLE HUNDRED DOLLARS, THOUSANDS, MILLIONS?
01:36:44.406: >> Planning Manager:  YOU ARE PROBABLY TALKING ABOUT -- I GUESS FOR LARGE PROJECTS DOWNTOWN, TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS.
01:36:55.784: >> Chair Milshteyn: OKAY. THANK YOU. COMMISSIONER MILLS?
01:36:57.752: >> Vice Chair Mills: WE DON'T WANT TO CHANGE THE MAY TO SHALL. IT'S SHALL BE IF WE THEY HAD -- WE NEED TO ADD AN IF STATEMENT. SO WHAT IS THE -- DO YOU HAVE SUGGESTIONS ON IF?
01:37:09.064: >> Planning Manager:  YEAH, LET ME NOODLE ON THIS A LITTLE BIT.
01:37:12.434: >> Vice Chair Mills: OKAY. RELATED TO FEES, BECAUSE SOMETHING WAS BROUGHT UP ABOUT PROPERTY TAXES WHICH I THINK IS APPROPRIATE -- YOU KNOW, A REALLY GOOD OBSERVATION, PARTICULARLY CONSIDERING WE ARE COUNTING PROPERTY TAXES IN THE AFFORDABILITY METRIC, HOW DOES THAT -- IS IT TRUE THAT THERE'S TAX ABATEMENTS FOR SOME -- FOR SOME AFFORDABLE UNITS AND IS THAT AVAILABLE TO PRIVATE DEVELOPERS?
01:37:37.459: >> Planning Manager:  YES, NO, MAYBE. SO STATE LAW AND -- STATE LAW PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK BY WHICH COMMUNITIES CAN GRANT A PAYMENT IN LIEU OF TAXES. THAT IS WHERE THE COMMUNITY CAN ELECT TO ATTRIBUTE SOME OTHER CONTRIBUTION TO AN AFFORDABLE UNIT, OTHER THAN THE TYPICAL CALCULATION OF MILLAGES ON PROPERTY VALUES. MOST COMMUNITIES DO THAT ON A CITY COUNCIL BY CITY COUNCIL DECISION BASIS IS. THAT IS A PETITION WILL COME TO CITY COUNCIL AND ASK FOR A PAYMENT IN LIEU. THE CITY COUNCIL WILL NEGOTIATE SOME CONTRACT THAT ARTICULATES HOW THAT WILL BE CONDUGGED IN THAT CASE. IT WILL BE EXECUTED AND THEN THAT DEVELOPER HAS THE BENEFIT OF THAT PAYMENT IN LIEU OF TAXES, TYPICALLY LESS THAN WHAT THOSE WOULD BE IF YOU WERE JUST PAYING UNDER TYPICAL CONDITIONS. HERE IN THE CITY, WE HAVE TAKEN THAT A STEP MORE PROGRESSIVELY AND WE SAY, IF YOU HAVE A FEDERALLY BACKED MORTGAGE SUPPORTING AFFORDABLE UNITS ON THE PROPERTY, YOU ARE ELIGIBLE FOR A PAYMENT IN LIEU OF TAXES. SO IN THAT CASE, THE CITY HAS CODIFIED THAT IF YOU HAVE A FEDERALLY PACKED SECURITY THAT MAKES THOSE UNITS AFFORDABLE, THEN YOU PAY $1 PER UNIT IN TAXES, INSTEAD OF WHAT NORMAL TAXES WOULD BE. THE MAYBE PART, I COULD SIGNATURE THAT'S NOT PART OF THE U.D.C. IT'S A SEPARATE ORDINANCE UNDER THE CODE. WE COULD INVESTIGATE WHAT WOULD BE -- IF THERE ARE POSSIBILITIES AND, AGAIN, I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE OF THE STATE LAW, THEY MIGHT BE LIMITED TO THAT FEDERAL SECURITIZATION, WHICH THAT MIGHT BE ABLE TO BE EXPANDED TO SAY IN SOMETHING LIKE THIS, WHERE THERE ISN'T NECESSARILY FEDERAL BACKING TO IT, BUT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO FIND A WAY TO APPLY A SIMILAR OR THE SAME PRINCIPLE TO THOSE UNITS.
01:39:23.398: >> Vice Chair Mills: BECAUSE PART OF THAT IS THE AGREEMENT OF THE 99-YEAR TERM?
01:39:28.670: >> Planning Manager:  YEAH.
01:39:29.838: >> Vice Chair Mills: IS THAT WHAT YOU ARE ENVISIONING AS THE ENFORCEMENT?
01:39:33.475: >> Planning Manager:  YEAH. IN THIS LANGUAGE, WE HAVE TAKEN THIS A STEP FORWARD. THESE PROJECTS WILL HAVE AN AFFORDABILITY AGREEMENT. THAT WILL BE THE MORE SPECIFIC LANGUAGE THAT WILL ARTICULATE HOW TO MAINTAIN THOSE UNITS AND HOW YOU WILL COOPERATE WITH THE CITY OR THE PARTNERS TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL TENANTS, ET CETERA. IT WILL ALSO PROVIDE SOME PROTECTIONS TO SAY THAT YOU CAN STILL DO CR CREDIT CHECKS. WHAT HAPPENS IF SOMEONE GOES INTO A UNIT AND THEY BECOME OVER INCOME? THERE ARE A LOT OF DETAILS THAT WE CAN PUT TOGETHER AN AFFORDABILITY AGREEMENT THAT IS NOT IN THE U.D.C. THAT WOULD BE UP AS WELL.
01:40:16.151: >> Vice Chair Mills: I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN THAT AND I WOULD WELCOME HEARING FROM OTHERS. I THINK IF YOU ARE PROVIDING THOSE AFFORDABLE UNITS AND HAVE AN AGREEMENT FOR 99 YEARS THAT THEY STAY AFFORDABLE TO -- AND THIS IS SOMETHING WE WANT TO SEE IN TOWN. I MEAN, THAT'S WHY WE ARE INCENTIVIZING THIS, THROUGH THIS PROPOSED ORDINANCE, THAT JUST SEEMS TO MAKE SENSE THAT WE WOULD WANT TO TRULY INCENTIVIZE THAT BY ALSO EXTENDING THAT PAYMENT IN LIEU OPTION. SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT LIVES IN THE U.D.C. AND IT WOULD HAVE TO GO SEPARATELY, ANIY WHAT, BUT I THINK A RECOMMENDATION TO INCLUDE THAT -- AT LEAST INVESTIGATE IT, I WOULD REALLY VALUE. THE OTHER THING -- LAST THING THAT'S ON MY LIST IS TALKING ABOUT THE TIMING AND YOUR -- IN TERMS OF WHEN THIS COMES INTO -- WHAT PROJECTS IN THE PIPELINE THIS WOULD APPLY TO. AND SO I THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL -- THE TWO KIND OF MILESTONES THAT I HEARD BROUGHT UP WERE PROJECTS THAT HAD ALREADY BEEN HEARD BEFORE, WHERE PROPOSALS WERE HEARD BEFORE THE DESIGN REVIEW BOARD BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING DOWNTOWN DISTRICTS, THEY ALL HAVE TO GO BEFORE THAT. I ALSO HEARD -- YOU KNOW, WE REQUIRE THE CITIZEN PARTICIPATION MEETING. SO IF THEY ALREADY HELD THEIR CITIZEN PARTICIPATION MEETING, ARE -- BUT WHAT DO YOU -- FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE, WHAT IS AN APPROPRIATE -- WHAT IS A MEASURABLE PLACE WHERE PEOPLE ARE IN THE PIPELINE THAT --
01:41:55.850: >> Planning Manager:  I WOULD PROBABLY SIMPLIFY IT AND SAY SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT OF THIS SHALL APPLY TO ANY PROJECTS SUBMITTED FOR CONSIDERATION AFTER A DATE CERTAIN.
01:42:07.161: >> Vice Chair Mills: AND THE -- AND WHEN YOU SAY SUBMITTED FOR CONSIDERATION --
01:42:12.267: >> Planning Manager:  I WOULD MEASURE THAT BY AN APPLICATION FOR SITE PLAN REVIEW, SUBMITTED TO OUR DEPARTMENT.
01:42:16.671: >> Vice Chair Mills: SO THE PROJECTS THAT ARE IN PROCESS, THAT PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT, THAT --
01:42:22.176: >> Planning Manager:  THEY HAVE BEEN BEFORE THAT DATE. ANYTHING AFTER THAT DATE, IT WOULD APPLY.
01:42:27.282: >> Vice Chair Mills: GOT IT. SO WE CAN SET THE DATE THAT THIS GOES INTO EFFECT, IF WE WANTED TO?
01:42:31.119: >> Planning Manager:  AND I THINK THAT MAKES MORE SENSE. A LOT OF TIMES WHAT HAPPEN IS AN ORDINANCE WILL BE SET TO A DATE CERTAIN. THIS ORDINANCE SHALL TAKE EFFECT ON DECEMBER 31, 2019. IF THE INTENTION IS TO PROVIDE SOME DEFERENCE TO THOSE PROJECTS THAT HAVE ALREADY STARTED, THERE COULD BE A SCENARIO WHERE THOSE AREN'T RESOLVED BY THAT DATE AND SO IF IT WERE A DATE CERTAIN OF EFFECTIVENESS, THE SAME CHALLENGE IS GOING TO APPLY THOSE PROJECTS. THAT'S WHY I WOULD PROBABLY PIN IT TO SOME STARTING POINT IN THE PROCESS AND I WOULD SAY, A SITE PLAN APPLICATION IS A REASONABLE STAND.
01:43:10.758: >> Vice Chair Mills: OKAY. AND FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE, I KNOW THAT PEOPLE HAVE -- I'M NOT THE REAL ESTATE PERSON, AND I DON'T KNOW HOW THE OPTIONS WORK. YOU DON'T HAVE THE SITE PLAN APPLICATION, YOU KNOW, BUT AS SOON AS YOU START THINKING ABOUT PROJECT. SO I'M NOT SURE HONIARA INTO THE FUTURE YOU WANT TO DO THAT. I LIKE THE IDEA ABOUT THE SITE PLAN APPLICATION.
01:43:37.518: >> Planning Manager:  MY INITIAL THOUGHT IS SOMETHING SOONER THAN RATHER. I DON'T THINK -- IF THE INTENTION IS TO REALIZE AFFORDABLE UNITS AND WE THINK THIS IS THE WAY TO DO THAT, I WOULD WANT THAT DATE TO BE CERTAIN. IT COULD POTENTIALLY BE AUGUST 1st. ANY PETITIONS THAT ARE SUBMITTED FOR SITE PLAN IMPROVEMENT AFTER AUGUST 1st. I'M NOT SAYING THAT'S DATE. I WOULD BE LESS INCLINED TO BUILD IN. SO INVESTIGATION. THAT EVERY INVESTIGATION OR KICKING TIRES OF A POTENTIAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT WOULD BE DEFERRED. I THINK YOU -- I WOULD SET A REASONABLE DATE THAT SAYS WE WILL FLIP A SWITCH, BUT WE WILL RECOGNIZE THOSE WHO GOT THIS FAR IN THE DUE DILIGENCE TO THE POINT OF SUBMITTAL. THAT WOULD BE AN APPROPRIATE DAY. FOR SURE, I DON'T WANT TO -- I DON'T WANT TO BE REMISS. THERE COULD BE SOMEBODY WHO IS PLANNING ON A DEVELOPMENT UNDER THESE SCENARIOS THAT MIGHT BE IMPACTED BY THAT STILL. BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE A REASONABLE STAND BY WHICH TO SET.
01:44:44.886: >> Vice Chair Mills: AND THIS IS A PUBLIC HEARING. WE ARE THAT YOU CANNING ABOUT IT TODAY. PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THIS TODAY SO WE COULD LITERALLY CITE IT FOR TOMORROW IF WE WANTED TO.
01:44:55.763: >> Planning Manager:  AGAIN, THAT'S ULTIMATELY A DECISION OF THE CITY COUNCIL. I THINK WHAT WOULD BE HELPFUL IS PART OF ANY CONSIDERATION OF THIS IS JUST -- THE LAPPING COMMISSIONESS VIEW THAT THAT SORT OF PHASED TRANSITION MAKES SENSE AND YOU WOULD ADVISE THAT UNDER CONSIDERATION. I FRANKLY THINK -- I DON'T THINK THAT YOU NEED TO COME UP WITH WHAT THAT ANSWER IS. I THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL IN ULTIMATELY HOW CITY COUNCIL VIEWS THIS AND WHATEVER VERSION THEY GO TO THEM TO SAY, HEY, WE ALSO THINK IN THE CONTEXT OF ENACTING THIS YOU SHOULD THINK ABOUT THOSE ISSUES SO THAT IT'S -- YOU KNOW, THAT WOULD BE REASONABLE TO PHASE THIS IN. SO PROJECTS THAT HAVE NOT ACHIEVED A CERTAIN THRESHOLD, IT'S NOT GOING TO APPLY.
01:45:40.374: >> Vice Chair Mills: GOT IT. SO YOU DON'T NECESSARILY WANT TO --
01:45:44.212: >> Planning Manager:  I DON'T NEED AN AMENDMENT. WHAT I'M HEARING IS THAT SUPPORT, THAT YES, IN FACT, THIS SHOULDN'T BE A SWITCH THAT SAYS REGARDLESS OF WHERE YOU ARE IN THE PROCESS, YOU HAVE TO COMPLY.
01:45:54.255: >> Vice Chair Mills: YES, I WILL SAY THAT I THINK THAT'S GREAT. THANK YOU.
01:45:59.393: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER WOODS.
01:46:01.863: >> Commissioner Woods: JUST A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT ARE COMING. ONE, I THINK IT'S GREAT THAT WE ARE CONTINUING TO THINK AND WAYS TO GET MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING HERE. IT WAS INTERESTING LISTENING TO THE DEVELOPERS WHO CAME, PARTICULARLY NOTING THAT THEY DON'T LIVE IN ANN ARBOR BUT THEY DO BUSINESS IN ANN ARBOR. CERTAINLY THAT'S STILL IMPORTANT FOR US. BUT THE -- SO THE QUESTION OF TAXES AND THERE'S NOT A LOT WE CAN DO ABOUT TAXES, PARTICULARLY NOT AT THIS LEVEL, WE ALL PAY 'EM AND WE ARE ALL WORRIED ABOUT THEM. WE JUST HAVE TO GO FORWARD WITH THAT. I'M A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED AS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT INCENTIVES. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A LITTLE BIT MORE WORK SO WE COULD FIGURE OUT EXACTLY HOW MUCH IS ACTUALLY GOING TO BE GIVEN BACK TO THE DEVELOPERS BECAUSE I THINK ONE DEVELOPER KIND OF -- IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN, MADE IT SEEM LIKE THAT'S NOT ANYTHING. SO, YOU KNOW -- AND IF THAT WAS ALL THAT WAS KEEPING THEM FROM DOING IT, THEY WOULD PROBABLY ALREADY BE DOING THAT.
01:47:13.501: >> Planning Manager:  SO I THINK THAT -- I WOULD AGREE WITH THAT COMMENT, THE U.D.C. ASSOCIATED APPLICATION FEES, I DON'T WANT TO SAY THEY ARE NOT SIGNIFICANT. THEY CAN BE SIGNIFICANT. BUT IN THE CONTEXT OF A UTILITY CONNECTION FEES AND TAP FEES, I THINK THOSE ARE MUCH MORE SUBSTANTIAL IN THE CONTEXT OF DEVELOPMENT COSTS, BUT I THINK THE POINT IS GOOD THAT THE U. D.C. FEES ARE AMONG THE FIRST FEES AT LEAST COMING TO THE CITY. THERE'S OTHER INVESTIGATION COSTS, DESIGN COSTS THAT ARE INCURRED AS WELL, BUT IT'S A BALANCE.
01:47:48.302: >> Commissioner Woods: YEAH. I WAS ALSO WONDERING HAVE WE HEARD FROM OTHER DEVELOPERS AND CITIZENS YET IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY THINK ABOUT THIS?
01:48:03.985: >> Planning Manager:  WE HAVE -- YOU KNOW, WE HAVE NOTIFIED ALL NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATIONS AT THE INITIAL PUBLIC HEARING AND FOLLOWED UP WITH ANYBODY WHO SAID THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO REMAIN IN CONTACT WITH IT.
01:48:17.565: >> Commissioner Woods: MM-HMM.
01:48:18.833: >> Planning Manager:  AS YOU KNOW WITH PROACTIVE THINGS LIKE THIS, IT'S OFTEN DIFFICULT TO GET A LOT OF FOLKS OUT.
01:48:25.172: >> Commissioner Woods: RIGHT.
01:48:25.806: >> Planning Manager:  AND AS YOU RECALL, WE ALSO INVITED ONE OF THE DEVELOPERS HERE THIS EVENING AS WELL AS AN ARCHITECT WHO DOES A LOT OF WOULD, IN THE CITY, AT THE WORKING SESSION JUST TO HEAR SOME MORE FEEDBACK AS WELL.
01:48:38.085: >> Commissioner Woods: MM-HMM.
01:48:38.719: >> Planning Manager:  I THINK -- AND THEN I WOULD SAY SINCE THAT, THE BULK OF THE FEEDBACK THAT I HEARD IS CONCERNED ABOUT TIMING, THAT A SENSE OF FAIRNESS TO PROJECTS THAT HAVE ALREADY INVESTED A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT UNDER A CERTAIN SET OF ASSUMPTIONS.
01:48:56.404: >> Commissioner Woods: OKAY. I DON'T KNOW IF I HEARD SOMEONE ELSE INDICATE THAT THEY WERE THINKING ABOUT POSTPONING THIS OR ANYTHING, AND THE REASON WHY I'M BRINGING THAT UP IS BEING ON PLANNING COMMISSION, YOU TIMES FEEL LIKE YOU ARE CAUGHT BETWEEN A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE, HALF THE FOLKS OUT THERE ARE SAYING WE ARE DOING TOO MUCH. ON THE OTHER HAND, WE HAVE A LOT OF FOLKS OUT THERE THAT WOULD LIKE TO LIVE IN ANN ARBOR, BUT IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE. AND THEN WE SEE A LOT OF BIG BUILDINGS GOING UP, EVEN THOUGH I THINK I HEARD SOMEONE SAY THAT WE STILL HAVE A HOUSING SHORTAGE. SO REALLY, IT'S A TOUGH ISSUE TO REALLY GET YOUR HEAD AROUND AS WELL AS GET YOUR ARMS AROUND. AND I DON'T ENVY MY COLLEAGUE WHO IS IN THE REALTY BUSINESS, BECAUSE I KNOW HE HEARS A LOT OF THIS. BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING. AS WE ARE LOOKING AT INCREASED TRANSPORTATION COSTS AND THEY HAVE A LIGHT TO LIVE HERE AS WELL. IT SHOULDN'T JUST BE THE PEOPLE WHO CAN GET THEIR FAMILIES PAY FOR THEIR APARTMENTS WHILE THEY ARE STUDENTS HERE THAT YOU BE ALLOWED TO DO THAT. I LIKE THE FACT THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY TACKLING THIS AND I KNOW IT WILL PROBABLY TAKE MORE TIME, BUT I THINK THIS IS A GOOD START. SO --
01:50:30.464: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL.
01:50:31.465: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: IN TERMS OF THE TIMING, I CONQUER THAT IT BEING. TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION, THAT THAT'S FIRST OBVIOUS POINT BECAUSE A LOT OF THIS STUFF BEFORE THEN IS KIND OF MUSHY. AND IN TERMS OF THE DESIGN PROCESS, I THIS IT IS BUT YOU REALLY HAVE TO GET EVERYTHING TOGETHER FOR THAT FIRST SITE PLAN SUBMISSION. AND I FEEL LIKE THAT THAT -- IF THEY ARE IN THE PIPELINE BEFORE THE DATE, THEN THEY SHOULD -- AT THAT POINT, IT'S PRETTY BAKED. I THINK THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE. I'M ALSO -- I LIKE THE INCENTIVES THING THAT YOU WERE THINKING ABOUT, THINKING BIG PICTURE. I THINK THAT WE REALLY JUST HAVE TO DO THAT BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY DIFFICULT TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THIS MOVE WITHOUT THAT. SO I APPRECIATE YOUR ADDITIONAL RESEARCH INTO BEING CREATIVE ABOUT HOW TO HANDLE THAT. I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT. ONLY A LITTLE CONFUSED ABOUT -- YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE PARKING AND IN D1 AND DEL 2, YOU ARE NOT REQUIRED PARKING. SO COULD YOU EXPLAIN HOW YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT THAT?
01:51:31.692: >> Planning Manager:  SURE. AND THE D1 AND D2, YOU ARE NOT REQUIRED TO PARK TO YOUR BASE F.A.R. SO IN THE D2, THAT'S 200% AND THE D1, THAT'S 400%. THERE'S NO PARKING IS REQUIRED FOR THAT FLOOR AREA. ONCE YOU START ACCESSING PREMIUMS FOR ANY REASON, THAT PREMIUM FLOOR AREA RATIO HAS TO BE PARKED AT A RATE OF 1 PER 1,000 SQUARE FEET REGARDLESS OF THE USE. WHAT THIS PROPOSED AMENITY WOULD DO IS SAY WHEN AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS PART OF THAT CALCULATION, YOU CAN BACK THAT SQUARE FOOTAGE OFF THAT CALCULATION.
01:52:09.029: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: THAT'S GREAT. I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT THE PREMIUMS ACTUALLY KICKED IN FOR THAT. AND THEN I'M JUST CURIOUS WITH THE WHOLE THING BROUGHT UP ABOUT BOULDER, DO YOU KNOW IF THAT WAS A SIMILAR SETUP TO THIS ONE AND THAT IS -- THIS IS FOR OUR PREMIUMS? WAS THAT MORE OF A MANDATORY THING OR DO YOU HAVE ANY SENSE OF HOW THAT PLAYED OUT IN TERMS OF THEIR RESEARCH? I KNOW YOU HAVE DONE A LOT OF RESEARCH  ON AFFORDABILITY AND I ALSO JUST REALLY APPRECIATE THE FAIRNESS IN YOUR WORK HERE. I THINK YOU DO A LOT OF REALLY GOOD WORK HERE. I'M CURIOUS IF YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT EXAMPLE AND WHETHER --
01:52:43.430: >> Planning Manager:  NO, IF THAT'S SOMETHING YOU WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT, I HAVE TO DO MORE RESEARCH ON IT. AND A. ALEXIS DELEO, WE HAVE TO GIVE HER A LOT OF CREDIT BECAUSE THEY HAVE DONE WORK IN THIS AREA.
01:53:00.347: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: I WONDER WHETHER IT WAS TRULY SIMILAR IN THAT WAY OR WHETHER IT WAS PREMIUM BASE OR WHETHER IT WAS JUST THE BASE BY RIGHT STUFF IS REQUIRED.
01:53:10.691: >> Planning Manager:  MY -- YEAH. I WOULD HAVE TO RESEARCH. I THINK IT'S MORE OF AN INCLUSIONARY ZONING MODEL.
01:53:17.631: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: MM-HMM.
01:53:18.766: >> Planning Manager:  BUT I DON'T THINK THE COMMENT IS UNREASONABLE.
01:53:22.136: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: NO, RIGHT.
01:53:23.771: >> Planning Manager:  THESE ARE ALL INCENTIVES WE ARE LOOKING AT AND I AGREE THAT WE ARE PROVIDING A BASE DEVELOPMENT THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS SECTION AT ALL. AGAIN, IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU ARE INTERESTED IN, I COULD LOOK INTO IT MORE.
01:53:36.216: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: I WOULD BE CURIOUS JUST TO SEE BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF COMPARABLE THING BETWEEN THE TWO CITIES AND I WOULD BE CURIOUS TO KNOW. I GUESS I FEEL LIKE THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT PIECE OF THE OVERALL AFFORDABILITY PUZZLE, BUT I FEEL LIKE THERE'S A WHOLE LOT OF WORK TO DO. THIS IS, IN MY MIND, NOT THE END OF THE AFFORDABILITY DISCUSSION THAT WE HAVE IN THIS CITY AND I DON'T WANT THIS TO BE LIKE, OH, WE DID THE THING FOR DOWNTOWN AND SO WE ARE KIND OF DONE WITH THAT. SO JUST IN TERMS OF OUR WORK, I'M REALLY FEELING THE URGENCY FROM MANY PEOPLE ABOUT THIS ISSUE AND THAT I HOPE WE LOOK FOR OTHER OPPORTUNITIES TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS AFFORDABILITY IN THE CITY. SO --
01:54:24.898: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN.
01:54:26.133: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR AND COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL, I COMPLETELY AGREE AS WELL AS COMMISSIONER WOODS. IT'S A DIFFICULT ISSUE BUT IT'S ALSO AN ISSUE THAT NEEDS A LOT OF ARROWS IN THE QUIVER, A LOT OF TOOLS IN THE TOOL BELT. SO GIVE YOU SOME REASSURANCE THAT THIS ISN'T BY ANY MEANS A SILVER BULLET THAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR, YOU KNOW, THE CITY IS ACTIVELY LOOKING AT ABOUT, YOU KNOW, 15 PLUS DIFFERENT PARCELS THROUGHOUT THE CITY, ASSESSING THE VIABILITY FOR PARTNERSHIP OF ANN ARBOR HOUSING COMMISSION OR NONPROFIT PARTNER TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND AT THE SAME TIME, YOU KNOW, WE JUST LOCKED IN 800 -- OR EXCUSE ME, 400 -- $880,000 FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING INTO THE TRUST FUND IN THIS LAST BUDGET CYCLE AND THAT. HOPEFULLY CONTINUE FOR THE NEXT SEVEN YEARS. SO, YOU KNOW, WE FOUND SOME DEDICATED FUNDING. WE ARE LOOKING AT POTENTIAL SITES AND THAT'S FROM A PUBLIC HOUSING PERSPECTIVE, BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO ATTACK THIS PROBLEM IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR AS WELL AND THAT'S WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH HERE. AND I REALLY APPRECIATE ALL OF WHY YOU ARE WORK THROUGHOUT ALL OF THIS. THIS HAS BEEN KIND OF -- THIS IS A PROJECT THAT IS NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART. SO FOR ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE IN THEAUDIENCE WHO TAKE ISSUE WH THIS, YOU CAN TAKE ISSUE WITH ME. IT'S EXCITING TO BE DISCUSSING AND IT'S REALLY ONLY ONE ARROW IN THE QUIVER. SO WITH RESPECT TO THE PAYMENT IN LIEU OF THE PLANNING FEES, I APPRECIATED THE SMALL DROP IN THE BUCKET BUT AT THE SAME TIME, THE PROPORTION. DEVELOPMENT THAT IS GOING TO BE A PUBLIC BENEFIT AND BY THAT I MEAN THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING ITSELF IS GOING TO BE RELATIVELY SMALL. THE FEES WE SHOULD, WAIVING SHOULD BE IN PROPORTION TO THAT,EN I THINK THIS IS -- YOU KNOW, IT'S 10,000 OR SO DOLLARS, BUT IN THE GRAND SCHEME OF WHAT THIS DEVELOPMENT IS, AND THE FEES ASSOCIATED, I THINK THAT'S A REASONABLE PROPORTION OF, LIKE, THE KINDS OF STUFF THAT WE SHOULD BE TRYING TO INCENTIVIZE. IN TERMS OF THE PHASING, I THINK IT WOULD BE -- I WOULD LOVE FOR IT TO -- OR AFTER LISTENING, I THINK IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE THAT IT BE SUBMISSION AND IT BE SOMETIME AT OR 30 DAYS AFTER PASSAGE OF NECE ANY ORDINANCE AMENDMENT. SO I THINK THAT MAKES SENSE. I DON'T KNOW IF WE CAN TAKE CARE OF THOSE TWO THINGS TODAY. IN TERMS OF PAYMENT IN LIEU TAXES PILOT. THAT WOULD BE IN THE CASE OF THE FEDERALLY -- THE FEDERAL LITTLE ASSURED MORTGAGES -- THE FEDERALLY BACKED MORTGAGES EXPANDING THAT TO THIS CASE. IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S A DIFFERENT KIND OF INITIATIVE THAT NEEDS TO BE DRIVEN BY DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE CITY. I GUESS I WOULD GIVE COLLEAGUES THE ASSURANCE THAT THAT WE COULD TAKE THAT UP. THERE ARE BEANS THAT NEED TO BE COUNTED WHEN IT COMES TO THAT AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE NOT OVER INCENTYIZING THIS AND -- INCENTIVIZING THIS. SO -- BUT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE THAT ON. IT SOUNDS LIKE THE PHASING -- THE PAYMENT IN LIEU OF PLANNING FEES ARE THE TWO OUTSTANDING THINGS I'M HEARING.
01:58:05.219: >> Planning Manager:  I'M CLOSE TO SOME LANGUAGE FOR YOU.
01:58:08.088: >> Councilmember Ackerman: OKAY. IF WE COULD MAKE THOSE TONIGHT, THAT WOULD BE PRETTY EXCEPTIONAL. IT'S ALSO MY BIRTHDAY. SO THAT COULD BE THE BEST BIRTHDAY PRESENT I COULD HAVE ASKED FOR! [ LAUGHTER ]
01:58:28.609: >> Chair Milshteyn: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COMMISSIONER BRIGGS?
01:58:31.378: >> Commissioner Briggs: THIS IS JUST A GENERAL QUESTION FOR PREBRETT, THAT HE CAN ANSWER AT SOME POINT WHEN HE'S NOT TYPING. I WAS WONDERING IF YOU HAD ANY GENERAL COMMENTS OR THOUGHTS -- IS SOUNDS LIKE ONE OF THE THEMES FROM SOME OF THE FOLKS WOULD FOLKS WHOSPOKE, I HEAR WHAT YOUT IS. YOU MAY BE SABOTAGING YOUR EFFORT RATHER THAN ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW, GOING DOWN THE ROAD THAT YOU ARE MEANING TO. AND SO I'M CURIOUS IF YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO JUST DISCUSS WHY YOU THINK THAT'S NOT THE CASE, WHY YOU FEEL LIKE THIS THIS IS MOVING US IN THAT DIRECTION.
01:59:14.921: >> Planning Manager:  MY -- I THINK THAT POSSIBILITY EXISTS. THE POSSIBILITY EXISTS THAT THIS COULD HAVE AN IMPACT IN WHICH LESS DEVELOPMENT HAPPENS BECAUSE OF THE SORT OF RESTRICTIONS OR CHALLENGES THAT THIS ADDS TO A PROTOTYPE OF DEVELOPMENT THAT WE HAVE BEEN GETTING NOW. SO I WANT TO BE CLEAR. I THINK THAT COULD HAPPEN. I THINK THE REASON IT'S WORTH WHILE IS THAT WITHOUT IT, WE ARE GETTING A TYPE OF DEVELOPMENT THAT IS PROVIDING SOME SUPPLY THAT HAS NOT TRADITIONALLY FURTHERED THIS PARTICULAR GOAL IN THE CITY BY EXPERIENCE. I THINK THAT'S A LITTLE BIT UNFAIR, BECAUSE I THINK ON -- SORT OF ON A HIGHER LEVEL, I THINK FOR THE SUPPLY -- I THINK MORE SUPPLY DOES HELP AFFORDABILITY. I THINK GENERALLY, THE PIPELINE OF UNITS THAT WE ARE APPROVING IN THE CITY IS RELATIVELY SMALL IN THE CONTEXT OF HOW MUCH SUPPLY YOU WOULD LIKELY HAVE TO ADD, IN ORDER TO SUBSTANTIALLY HAVE AN IMPACT ON AFFORDABILITY, JUST FROM A SUPPLY AND DEMAND MODEL. AND SO I THINK -- I THINK THOSE ARE ALL VALID CONCERNS, BUT ON THE BALANCE, I THINK THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO POTENTIALLY -- AGAIN, IT COULD HAVE THAT IMPACT, BUT I -- THIS SEEMS MORE -- IT SEEMS MORE PLAUSIBLE THAN THAN TRYING TO ENACT SOMETHING THAT WOULD DRIVE SUPPLY TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT WOULD HAVE THE SAME IMPACT ON THE MARKETPLACE. I THINK THAT WOULD BE A MUCH BROADER CONVERSATION ABOUT DEVELOPMENT LEVELS THROUGHOUT STILL AND VARIOUS LOCATIONS AND AT WHAT SCALE. SO THAT'S WHY I THINK THIS APPROACH IS REASONABLE.
02:01:13.006: >> Commissioner Briggs: AS A FOLLOW-UP TO THAT, IS THERE -- ARE THERE ANY METRICS THAT WE SHOULD BE PUTTING IN PLACE RIGHT NOW TO BE THINKING ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT WE ARE ACTUALLY ACHIEVING OUR GOALS, TIME FRAMES THAT WE SHOULD BE REEVALUATING THIS. IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD BE THINKING OF RIGHT NOW?
02:01:33.427: >> Planning Manager:  WE DO MEASURE THE AFFORDABLE UNIVUNITS.I THINK THAT'S SOMETHE WOULD WANT TO AS A COMMUNITY LOOK LEEK LIKE AND SEE HOW THAT TRAJECTORY CHANGED AT ALL, AND WHAT FACTORS, IN ADDITION TO THIS, CONTRIBUTED TO IT AND DO WE WANT TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS.
02:01:57.517: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER SAUVE.
02:02:00.720: >> Commissioner Sauve: SO A COUPLE OF JUST KIND OF SMALL THINGS. TIMING WITH THE SUBMITTAL, I THINK IS MORE -- SOMETHING IN THE PIPELINE YET? KIND OF A BOOKKEEPING QUESTION ABOUT THE FEE REIMBURSEMENT VERSUS COULD YOU FORWARD THOSE FEES TOWARDS THE PAYMENT IN LIEU IN TERMS OF, LIKE, WHAT ACCOUNTS THIS GOES UNDER SINCE THEY ARE GOING BACK TO THE DEVELOPER. I'M NOT SURE IF THAT'S A SMOOTHER PROCESS.
02:02:27.214: >> Planning Manager:  WE CAN LOOK AT THAT. I THINK THE THING IS TO SET UP THE OBLIGATION AND IT COULD BE HANDLED IN A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT WAYS.
02:02:34.788: >> Commissioner Sauve: SURE. AND THEN I THINK WHAT I'M HEARING TONIGHT -- I THINK WE HEARD AT WORKING SESSIONS ABOUT PAYMENT IN LIEU AND THE FACT THAT THIS IS A CONSOLIDATION OF THE PREMIUM AND THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING PREMIUM INTO ONE, CORRECT, IS THAT WE --
02:02:53.974: >> Planning Manager:  OKAY THAT AGAIN.
02:02:55.742: >> Commissioner Sauve: THE RESIDENTIAL PREMIUM OPTION AND THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING PREMIUM --
02:02:59.546: >> Planning Manager:  WE ARE COMBINING THEM INTO A SINGLE PREMIUM.
02:03:04.451: >> Commissioner Sauve: SO THAT MEANS YOU CAN NO LONGER JUST ADD RESIDENTIAL TO GET THOSE PREMIUMS OR THE SUPER PREMIUM WITH THE ENERGY STANDARDS AND THOSE SORT OF THINGS. YOU HAVE TO INCLUDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING.
02:03:15.262: >> Planning Manager:  YOU CAN ACCESS OTHER PREMIUMS BUT IF YOU ARE INTENDING TO USE THE HOUSING -- IF URINED TENDING TO USE ANY HOUSING FOR PREMIUM, ACCESS, YOU HAVE TO BLEND MARKET AND AFFORDABLE.
02:03:28.441: >> Commissioner Sauve: IN WHAT IS IN ON THE TABLE? I THINK THAT'S THE COMPONENT THAT MAY BE TRIGGERING SOME OF THE COMMENTS AND CONCERNS ABOUT RESIDENTIAL. I'M LOOKING AT THE 15 AND 20% AND WONDERING IF WE COULD ALLOW ALL OF THAT TO GO TO PAYMENT IN LIEU ESP ESPECIALLY WHEN TALKING ABOUT HOW MANY PARCELS THE CITY IS EVALUATING TO DO AFFORDABLE HOUSING WITHIN THE CITY LIMITS AND THAT THE PAYMENT IN LIEU, WE KNOW THAT THE KIND OF COMPOUNDING FACTOR TO LEVERAGE MORE FUNDING COULD MOVE MORE ON DIFFERENT SITES. AND WHAT THAT KIND OF DOES, ONCE WE GET TO THE 30%, IS THAT 30% IT WOULD HAVE TO BE INCLUDED BECAUSE YOU ARE GETTING THE EXTRA BENEFITS OF ACTUALLY 250% INSTEAD OF 300% FOR THE 20 -- YOU KNOW THE LOWER DOWN AND YOU ARE GETTING THE HEIGHT INCREASE. SO THOSE ARE LIKE DOUBLE PREMIUMS THAT YOU SHOULD INCLUDE IT ON SITE AND THAT'S A SMALLER FOOTPRINT. SO I'M ACTUALLY -- I WILL PUT THAT TO THE TABLE OF DISCUSSION NO PUT OPTION FOR ALL PAYMENT IN LIEU IN THOSE FIRST TWO TIERS. SO THAT IT CAN BE FULL MARKET RATE.
02:04:45.819: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL. RIB.
02:04:49.356: >> Co.>> Commissioner Gibb-Rand I HEAR WHERE YOU ARE GOING, THE LEVERAGING THAT THE NONPROFITS TO MAKE MORE MONEY OU UNITE OF E MONEY THAT THEY GET. THE THING THAT THAT WOULD NOT ADDRESS IS THIS ALLOWING 60% A.M.I. AND OUR NONPROFIT PARTNERS TEND TO DO 30% A.M.I. AND LESS. AND SO I FEEL LIKE THIS ALLOWS US TO HAVE A BROADER SPECTRUM FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. I'M NOT AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING EXPERT BUT JUST LIKE THE SECTIO. MAYBE THEN -- I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW THIS WORKS BUT I KNOW THAT I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A RANGE OF OPTIONS FOR PEOPLE SO THAT IT'S -- IT'S -- SO THAT WE ARE ADDRESSING MORE FULLY THE WHOLE SPECTRUM OF THE A.M.I. AND I FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE THE OPTION TO DO LESS THAN 60%. AND THEY COULD GO HEAD TO HEAD WITH, YOU KNOW, ANN ARBOR HOUSING COMMISSION FOR THE 30% BUT THEY ARE JUST NOT GOING TO DO IT, BECAUSE THEY CAN'T LEVERAGE THE SAME KIND OF GRANTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT, THAT THE NONPROFITS CAN. I THINK HAVING THIS AS THE 60% MEANS THAT THE 60% STUFF IS GOING TO GET BUILT AND IT'S NOT GOING TO GET BUILT BY ANN ARBOR HOUSING COMMISSIONER AVALON. AND THAT'S THE THING I LIKE ABOUT THE KIND OF MANDATORY PIECE OF THIS, IS THAT IT MEANS THAT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE THE PERSON IN ANN ARBOR. I MEAN, 60% A.M.I. IS REALLY PRETTY HIGH BUT IT ALSO MEANS YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO BUY A PLACE TOO. YOU KNOW? SO I FEEL LIKE THE NONPROFITS ARE TAKING CARE OF THE LOWER PERCENTAGE. SO WHEN THE CITY IS PARTNERING WITH THEM, THEN WE ARE AUTOMATICALLY SAYING WE ARE JUST DOING THE 30% AND LOWER, WHEREAS THIS IS ALLOWING A HIGHER CEILING, UP TO 60%. SO THAT ELSE ATHE POOH HE IS THAT I KNEEL LIKE EVEN THOUGH I REALLY LIKE -- I FEEL LIKE EVEN THOUGH I REALLY LIKE THE PAYMENT IN LIEU. THEY ARE NONPROFITS AND THEY HAVE ACCESS TO ALL OF THOSE KINDS OF GRANTS, I FEEL LIKE WE HAVE A BROADER SPECTRUM WITH THIS APPROACH IN TERMS OF WHAT THE DEVELOPER CAN DO AND THEY TALKED ABOUT KIND OF THEIR -- MY GUESS, BASED ON OUR CONVERSATION AND OUR WORKING SESSION IS THAT THEY WILL DO THAT CLOSER TO THE HIGHER PERCENTAGE BECAUSE IT'S EASIER TO MIX THAT IN THEIR BUILDING, WHICH WAS ONE OF THE CONCERNS. IT'S SORT OF LIKE HOW DO PEOPLE COEXIST, AND SO MY GUESS IS THAT THEY WILL PROBABLY END UP BEING IN THAT MORE IN THE 60, 50, YOU KNOW, RANGE. AND I JUST WANT THAT TO BE ABLE TO BE IN THE CITY TOO, I GUESS.
02:07:24.277: >> Chair Milshteyn: PERSONALLY, I LIKE THE IDEA BECAUSE ALL OF A SUDDEN IT WILL CREATE MORE DIVERSITY IN HOUSING. SO IT WILL ALLOW OUR NONPROFIT PARTNERS TO DO 30%, AND THEY WILL STILL HAVE MONEY COMING IN FOR THAT, BUT THEN IT WILL ALSO ALLOW THE PRIVATE DEVELOPERS TO DO HALF OF THE 60% A.M.I. SO I SORT OF LIKE THAT IDEA, BECAUSE IN MY OPINION IT CREATES MORE DIVERSITY. IT WON'T ALL BE 60%. IT WILL OFFER, YOU KNOW, SOME OF THE 30% TO BE OUT THERE WITH OUR NONPROFIT PARTNERS.
02:07:58.311: >> Commissioner Sauve: YEAH, I GUESS MY CONCERN AND WHAT I'M PROPOSING IT AS, WE WOULD SEE NOTHING MORE THAN WE WOULD SEE 60% IN THESE UNITS AS THE WORST CASE SCENARIO THIS IS PUTTING, YOU KNOW -- THESE WERE VERY EASY PREMIUMS WHICH I THINK IS WHAT WE WERE SEEING IN THE DEVELOPMENT BEFORE. AND NOW THEY ARE VERY HARD PREMIUMS AND THAT WE MIGHT SEE THEM AT ALL, AND AT SOME POINT, WE WANT TO FILL THE COVERS OF AFFORDABILITY AND SO HOW DO WE TAKE A STEP TO THAT? AND AT THE AMENDMENT, YOU KNOW, IF ALL OF A SUDDEN THERE IS AN INCENTIVE IS THAT WE COULD AMEND FROM ALL PAYMENT IN LIEU TO 25%, AND KIND OF GROW IT FROM THERE. AND SO I THINK IT'S -- IT'S A STARTING POINT THAT WE KEEP IT AT 50% AND THEN AMEND IT DOWN IF WE ARE NOT SEEING IT. OR IS THERE AN URGENCY THAT WE PUT A LOWER THRESHOLD, SEE WHAT WE GET OUT OF IT AND IF WE ARE GETTING ENOUGH, SAY LET'S MIX IT BACK IN AND AMEND TO IT? I THINK THERE'S TWO WAYS TO MOVE THAT. AND IT'S ABOUT WHAT THE URGENCY IS AND WHAT WE THINK WE WILL GET QUICKER OUT OF THIS, IN KIND OF MORE MAGNITUDE WHEN IT COMES TO THE SUPPLY AND THE DEMAND.
02:09:04.611: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER BRIGGS.
02:09:05.879: >> Commissioner Briggs: YES, I WOULD AGREE WITH COMMISSIONER SAUVE AS PROVIDING AS AN OPTION, AS THE FULL PAYMENT IN LIEU. I'M ABSOLUTELY NOT AN EXPERT ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING AT ALL. JUDGING ONLY IN MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE IN THE PAST COUPLE OF WEEKS WHEN I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO SECURE HOUSING FOR SOMEONE AT VERY LOW INCOME, I CAN FIND 60% A.M.I. IS ACTUALLY NOT AN ISSUE. YOU KNOW? IT'S THIS -- IT IS REALLY CHALLENGING -- I MEAN, WE JUST DON'T HAVE AVAILABILITY IN ANN ARBOR. WE HAVE WAITING LISTS THAT ARE CLOSED. SO THE URGENCY IS CLEARLY WITH -- WITH THE 30% A.M.I. AND WE NEED TO FILL THAT. AND SO LEVERAGING FUNDS AND HAVING -- GETTING MORE MONEY INTO THAT HOUSING SUPPLY -- THAT HOUSING FUND IS CRITICAL RIGHT NOW. SO I CAN UNDERSTAND THE DESIRE TO CREATE THAT MORE FLEXIBILITY AND DIVERSITY IN HOUSING STOCK AND I -- I'M MORE THERE THAN I WAS A MONTH AGO AND I WOULD BE OPEN TO SAYING, LET'S LEAVE AS AN OPTION TO THE DEVELOPER IN TERMS OF WHERE THEY WOULD LIKE TO GO WITH THIS. ANYWAY,S WHAT I THINK WE SHOULD BE INCENTIVIZING IS THAT. WE REALLY HAVE A NEED.
02:10:34.200: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER MILLS.
02:10:35.234: >> Vice Chair Mills: THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THAT UP, COMMISSIONER SAUVE. THAT WAS BURIED IN MY MENTAL LIST, BUT NOT HERE. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT STRIKES ME EVEN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS BUILDING, AND THAT CAME OUT OF OUR WORKING SESSION, IS THE MANAGEMENT. I KNOW THIS IS A HYPOTHETICAL BUILDING, BUT IN THE 15% AFFORDABLE PREMIUM, YOU WOULD THEN BE MANAGING THE DIFFERENCE -- OF THE DIFFERENT KIND OF PAPERWORK THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH MANAGING THE 3700 SQUARE FEET AND IF YOU ARE ACTUALLY ONLY BUILDING HALF OF THAT ON SITE, LIKE, THAT'S TWO UNITS MAYBE. LIKE -- AND SO -- BUT WHAT I REALLY LIKE ABOUT THIS, THIS ALSO ADDRESSES WHAT COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN WAS TALKING ABOUT IN THE STEP CHANGE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE 15% AND THE 20% LEVEL AND THE 30% LEVEL AND THEN IF YOU WANT TO GET THAT 30%, THERE IS SOMETHING ADDITIONAL. THIS IS A DOUBLE BONUS, YOU CAN MAX OUT, BUT ALSO HAVE THIS PROVISION TO EXCEED THE HEIGHT LIMIT. AND SO I REALLY LIKE THAT. I WOULD -- I WOULD DO IT AS YOU SUGGESTED, WHICH IS ONLY TO PROVIDE THAT AS AN OPTION TO HAVE PAYMENT IN LIEU FOR THE ENTIRETY OF THE AMENITY FLOOR AREA FOR THE 15% AFFORDABLE OPTION AND THE 20% AFFORDABLE OPTION. SO I WANT TO MOVE THAT.
02:12:11.297: >> Chair Milshteyn: IT'S BEEN MOVED. SECONDED? WELL, THE MOTION HAS BEEN MADE. THE SECONDER WILL DISCUSS IT RIGHT, AFTERWARDS. COMMISSIONER SAUVE, SECOND. COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT.
02:12:21.574: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: I HADN'T ACTUALLY THOUGHT OF THAT OPTION. I WAS VERY EXCITED TO SEE THAT IT WASN'T JUST A FEE IN LIEU FOR ALL OF THEM. I GUESS MY CONCERN WITH NOT REQUIRING THE UNITS ON SITE IS THAT WHERE MIGHT THEY THEN BE? LIKE, THEY COULD THEN -- IT COULD BE BUILT OUTSIDE OF D1 AND D2, AND IS THERE A NEED FOR MORE AFFORDABILITY IN THOSE ZONES?
02:12:50.369: >> Chair Milshteyn: AND I TEND TO AGREE WITH THAT. I DON'T WANT 100% TO GO, JUST BECAUSE THERE IS A NEED FOR 60% A.M.I. IN D.1 AND D2. I KNOW THAT 60% A.M.I. IS ACHIEVABLE IN FINDING HOUSING HOUSING OUTSIDE THE DOWNTOWN AREA, BUT IT IS NOT ACHIEVABLE IN THE DOWNTOWN AREA AND THESE INCENTIVES FOR THE DOWNTOWN AREA AND THERE SHOULD BE SOME AFFORDABLE HOUSING ON SITE. SO I'M NOT IN FAVOR OF MAKING IT 100%. AND I COULD ALSO -- I COULD BE TALKED INTO ANOTHER PERCENTAGE, BUT NOT 100%. FURTHER DISCUSSION ON THE MOTION? COMMISSIONER BRIGGS?
02:13:35.715: >> Commissioner Briggs: I AGREE WITH WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IN THEORY. YEAH, IT WOULD BE GREAT TO HAVE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN EVERY DISTRICT OF OUR CITY AND I THINK THERE SHOULD BE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN EVERY SCHOOL DISTRICT, AS I'M TRYING TO SECURE HOUSING FOR SOMEBODY WHO IS LIKE ON THE BEST SIDE FOR THEIR KIDS AND I THINK IT'S RIDICULOUS THAT THAT'S NOT AVAILABLE, BUT WE -- IN TERMS OF HOUSING VALUES AND WHERE WE CAN PERHAPS INCENT -- YOU KNOW, LEVERAGE THE MOST PAYMENT TOWARDS THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUND, THAT'S PROBABLY COMING OUT OF D1 AND D2 TO BE ABLE TO -- AM I WILL RIGHT IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO HELP FUND OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUN. EVEN IF WE ARE NOT GETTING THE SUPPLY THERE, WE ARE HELPING TO SUPPLY THE FUND, THAT SEEMS PRETTY GREAT. SO -- COUNSELOR ARGUMENT. COUNTER ARGUMENT.
02:14:36.342: >> Chair Milshteyn: MY ONLY CONCERN IS THAT ALL OF A SUDDEN, WE ARE MOVING IN WHERE -- WE ARE ALLOWING -- I SHOULDN'T SAY ALLOWING. ALL OF A SUDDEN, THE DOWNTOWN CORE IS THE WEALTHY, AND EVERYTHING AROUND IS NOT. I SHOULDN'T SAY EVERYTHING, BUT WE ARE MOVING ALL OF OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING OUT OF THE DOWNTOWN AREA, AND I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT. COMMISSIONER SAUVE.
02:15:05.104: >> Commissioner Sauve: SO I THINK LOOKING AT THE EXAMPLES WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE MANAGEMENT OF A COUPLE OF UNITS IN THE SMALL, ONE SUPER PREMIUM SITE, WHICH WOULD REQUIRE THE AFFORDABLE ON SITE WOULD OFFER FOUR TIMES THE AMOUNT OF AFFORDABLE UNITS THAT THE 15% WOULD. SO IN TERMS OF LIKE, THAT PROPORTION OF MAKING SURE IT'S REQUIRED FOR THAT 15 AND 20%, YOU ARE GOING TO GET WAY MORE BANG TO REALLY REQUIRE IT, AND GET THOSE BONUS INCENTIVES ABOUT THE HEIGHT, YOU KNOW, THE 250% THAT THE METRICS OF EVEN THAT PROPORTION -- 12,000 SQUARE FEET TO 3,000 SQUARE FEET WHEN WE LOOK AT THE EXAMPLE SCENARIO AND JUST THE MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE. I THINK WHAT IT WOULD DO IS IF YOU HAVE THE SAME KIND OF INGREDIENTS IN EACH COLUMN, YOU CAN RUN METRICS ONE WAY, BUT IF GETTING SUPER PREMIUM DOES A LOT MORE FOR YOU, THERE MIGHT ACTUALLY BE THAT THIRD TIER INCENTIVE THAT GETS PEOPLE ALL THE WAY UP TO THERE INSTEAD OF PICKING SECOND TIER BECAUSE YOU GET THE 250% INSTEAD OF 300% OF THE RESIDENTIAL AREA. THERE'S OTHER PUSH/PULL METRICS AT PLAY THAT ALLOW DEVELOPERS TO USE THOSE NUMBERS AND REALLY FIGURE OUT WHAT THE PREMIUM AMOUNT AND END THE D1 DISTRICTS. SO, YOU KNOW IT WOULD BE A LOT OF SCENARIO PLANNING TO REALLY CONFIRM THAT THAT'S THE CASE. I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE AMOUNT OF SQUARE FOOTAGE ON SITE THAT SEEPER PREMIUM METRIC IS WHERE WE WOULD GET, YOU KNOW, I THINK THE CRITICAL MASS THAT WE WANT, INSTEAD OF A COUPLE OF UNITS SPRINKLED HERE AND THERE. IF THERE ARE SITES -- ESPECIALLY D1 OR D2 DISTRICTS YOU CAN'T GET TO THE SUPER PREMIUM. THE NUMBERS MIGHT NOT WORK, BECAUSE YOU ARE BALANCING OUT THE TAXES AND ALL THE OTHER THINGS INVOLVED. I'M AFRAID TO SEE THAT STALL OUT. BUT --
02:17:05.024: >> Chair Milshteyn: I DON'T KNOW IN I WOULD FEEL COMFORTABLE MOVING ON THIS ON ALL OF THIS TONIGHT WITHOUT GETTING SOME -- SO IF THIS IS GOING TO MOVE FORWARD, I WOULD WANT MORE PUBLIC PARTICIPATION THAN JUST US MAKING THIS CHANGE AT THE TABLE HERE. I'M SORRY, COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN. [ OFF MICROPHONE COMMENT ]
02:17:32.718: >> Chair Milshteyn: THAT'S VERY TRUE. SO IF WE ARE GOING TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS, AND THIS -- WITH THIS MOTION, TO AMEND, THAT WOULD BE MY -- I WOULD WANT TO -- BEFORE I ACTUALLY -- BEFORE I COULD VOTE IN FAVOR OF THIS AMENDMENT, I WOULD WANT TO ADDITIONAL PUBLIC PARTICIPATION. FURTHER DISCUSSION ON THE MOTION? TO AMEND? MR. LENART, CAN YOU REMIND US WHAT WE ARE VOTING ON.
02:18:08.154: >> Planning Manager:  THE PROPOSED AMENDMENT WOULD ALLOW PAYMENT IN LIEU FOR ALL AMENITY SQUARE FOOTAGE IN THE 15 AND 20% AMENITY LEVELS.
02:18:23.702: >> Chair Milshteyn: OKAY. COMMISSIONER MILLS.
02:18:25.104: >> Vice Chair Mills: THIS WAS ONE OF THE THINGS WE DISCUSSED A LOT IN THE WORKING SEG. SO -- WORKING SESSION. THE RECOMMENDATION THAT YOU ARRIVED AT, CAN YOU WALK US THROUGH HOW YOU ARRIVED AT THAT? AND PARTICULARLY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HEARD ABOUT WAS -- WAS THIS MANAGEMENT COMPONENT AND, YOU KNOW, MANAGING A FEW UNITS. SO CAN YOU HELP US UNDERSTAND WHY THE PROPOSAL AS WRITTEN RATHER THAN AS WE PROPOSED IN AMENDMENT TWO IS THE WAY TO GO?
02:18:51.197: >> Planning Manager:  YEAH, THE PROPOSAL AS PRESENTED IS IT -- IT DOESN'T SOLVE THAT. WE DIDN'T DISCUSS THE SORT OF CHALLENGES OPERATIONALLY OF A SMALL FRACTION OF UNITS. SOME -- SOME PROPERTY OWNERS ARE WELL-VERSED IN MANAGING AFFORDABLE UNITS, SOME LESS SO. WE PROPOSED THIS MORE BECAUSE WE WERE HEARING -- WE WERE HEARING CLEAR DIRECTION FROM THIS BOARD THAT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO REALIZE UNITS THAT THERE WAS A DESIRE THAT -- FOR DIVERSITY OF HOUSING DOWNTOWN, WHERE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT LEVERAGING THE PROPERTY, THAT IT WOULD BE UNFORTUNATE THAT ALL THAT HAPPENED OUT OF THAT WAS FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTION. AND SO THE 50% WAS A -- IN AN HE ELEGANT SPLITTING OF THAT BABY.
02:19:49.555: >> Vice Chair Mills: DID THIS COME UP AT ALL -- I'M JUST GOING BACK TO THE STAFF REPORT NOW WHEN -- WHAT IS THE ACRONYM, THE H.H.S.A.B. DISCUSSED THIS? I'M JUST TRYING TO SEE IF IT -- BECAUSE THEY WROTE US A LETTER, TALKING ABOUT LIKE WHAT THEY LIKED AND WHAT THEY -- WHAT THEY WERE PARTICULARLY EXCITED ABOUT, AND THE CHANGES THAT THEY WANTED TO SEE. AND I DON'T KNOW THAT THIS WAS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THEY WERE PARTICULARLY EXCITED ABOUT, BUT MAYBE IT DEPOSIT FULLY REFLECT THE CONVERSATION. -- IT DIDN'T FULLY REFLECT THE CONVERSATION.
02:20:17.683: >> Planning Manager:  YEAH, I DON'T THINK THEY FOCUSED ON IT. I THINK GENERALLY, THEY APPRECIATED THE BALANCE OF BOTH GROWING THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUND TO LEVERAGE OTHER INVESTMENTS WHILE ALSO REALIZING SOME LEVEL OF AFFORDABILITY DOWNTOWN. IF I RECALL, THEY -- I THIS HE Y GENERALLY RECOGNIZED IT AND WENT ON TO OTHER ASPECTS OF IT.
02:20:44.009: >> Vice Chair Mills: OKAY.
02:20:44.577: >> Chair Milshteyn: FURTHER DISCUSSION ON THE AMENDMENT.
02:20:45.778: >> Planning Manager:  AND JUST FOR SAKE OF COMPLICATING, I'M -- AS I SAID, THIS WAS COMING FROM A -- THIS WAS COMING FROM CONFLICT ON THIS BOARD, I THINK, THAT THE BALANCE OF ACHIEVING INVESTMENT AND UNITS. IF -- IF THE PLANNING COMMISSION BELIEVES THAT THERE IS VAL TO HAVE -- VALUE TO HAVING A DIVERSITY IN THE DOWNTOWN DISTRICT, IT MIGHT BE CONCEIVABLE THAT THERE SHOULD BE AN INCREMENTAL COST WHEN THAT'S NOT REALIZED, THAT IS, IF YOU PROVIDE HALF OF THE UNITS AND WE REALIZE THAT DIVERSITY, YOU -- YOU PAY A PAYMENT IN LIEU OF X, AND IF YOU CHOOSE TO NOT INCORPORATE THAT DIVERSITY INTO YOUR HOUSING INTO DOWNTOWN, MAYBE THERE'S A FACTOR TO THAT X BECAUSE WE ARE FORGOING SOME OF THAT DIVERSITY. JUST ANOTHER POSSIBILITY THAT MIGHT BE IN THE MIDDLE OF WHAT YOU ARE DISCUSSING.
02:22:00.452: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER SAUVE.
02:22:02.554: >> Commissioner Sauve: SORRY THAT, WAS ALSO KIND OF IN MY NOT HERE, BUT -- LIKE, A 1.2 FACTOR PAYMENT IN LIEU FOR THE ADDITIONAL 50% SORT OF THING THAT WE COULD MOVE AND BOOST THAT FUNDING MORE, IF YOU OPTED TO DO EVERYTHING OFFSITE, YOU COULD DO AN ADDITIONAL -- YOU KNOW, INSTEAD OF LIKE -- THAT'S KIND OF GIVING, -- LIKE, THERE'S STILL A -- A TRADEOFF TO IT, AND, SO, YOU KNOW FROM WHAT WE WERE SAYING PREVIOUSLY OF JUST LIKE 50%, YOU CAN DECIDE TO DO IT OR NOT. THE TRADEOFF WOULD THEN BE YOU GOT AN ADDITIONAL MULTIPLIER APPLIED TO IT. SO YOU CAN STILL DO IT ALL OFFSITE, BUT IF WE ARE DOING THIS WHOLE PAYMENT IN LIEU, HOW DO WE EXTRA INCENTIVIZE IT? SO I REALLY -- I LIKE THAT IDEA. IT WAS KIND OF IN THE -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT METRIC IS. I THINK THAT IS KIND OF -- IF WE ARE LOOKING AT THAT METRIC, IT MIGHT BE SOMETHING TO KIND OF REEVALUATE AND COMMENT WITH INPUT BEFORE, LIKE -- I DON'T WANT TO GUESS A METRIC HERE TODAY TO MAKE AN AMENDMENT.
02:23:12.624: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER WOODS.
02:23:14.226: >> Commissioner Woods: I DON'T PARTICULARLY CARE FOR THE 100% OR EVEN 50% PAYMENT IN LIEU, BECAUSE I THINK CERTAINLY WE ARE TALKING ABOUT FINANCES AND MONEY AND THAT SORT OF THING, BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS, ARE WE GOING TO HAVE DIVERSITY OF HOUSING WHICH GENERALLY WILL ALSO EQUATE TO A DIVERSITY OF PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY LIVING THERE AND IT'S VERY EASY TO SAY, WE'LL TAKE THE MONEY AND EVERYBODY ON THE OUTSKIRTS WILL BE OF A CERTAIN ECONOMIC BASIS AND THOSE WHO LIVE DOWNTOWN WILL BE DIFFERENT. I MEAN WE KEEP SEEING THAT HAPPENING TIME AFTER TIME AFTER TIME. AND SO FROM MY POINT OF VIEW, IT'S JUST IMPORTANT AT SOME POINT TO SAY, WELL, WE HAVE ALREADY TRIED THAT. I MEAN, RIGHT NOW, I THINK MANY OF OUR DEVELOPERS DO DECIDE TO DO THE PAYMENT IN LIEU, RIGHT? I MEAN, I SEE PEOPLE SHAKING THEIR HEADS, YES, NO, THEY DO.
02:24:16.889: >> Planning Manager:  WE DON'T HAVE THAT OPTION CURRENTLY UNDER PREMIUMS AND WE JUST HAVE A FEW PROJECT FIRSTS LOOKING AT THE HOUSING PROJECT PREMIUMS DOWNTOWN.
02:24:25.998: >> Commissioner Woods: BUT NOT WITH THE AFFORDABLE --
02:24:28.333: >> Planning Manager:  BUT WITH THE PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS, THERE HAVE BEEN A FEW PROJECTS BUT THE MAJORITY OF THE P.D. PROJECTS HAVE NOT INVOKED THAT OR PUD PROJECTS THAT INCLUDED THAT WERE NOT REALIZED.
02:24:41.213: >> Commissioner Woods: WERE NOT REALIZED. OKAY. SO DO WE HAVE ANY EXAMPLES WHERE THEY DECIDED TO GO AHEAD AND DO AFFORDABLE HOUSING RIGHT WITHIN THE DEVELOPMENT THE WAY WE ARE PROPOSING.
02:25:00.332: >> Planning Manager:  WE HAVE A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES WHERE THAT'S HAPPENED WITH AFFORDABLE UNITS IN THEM. STATE STREET LOFTS ON THE CORNER OF WASHINGTON, THE CITY APARTMENTS WAS DONE THROUGH AN RFP PROCESS, AND THEN ASHLEY NEWS ACTUALLY HAD SOME AFFORDABLE UNITS INCORPORATED INTO IT, BUT I WOULD SAY THAT -- I THINK WE HAVE LEARNED FROM ALL OF THOSE EXPERIENCES WHEN WE ARE REALIZING THOSE UNITS ALSO HOW TO MAKE THEM SORT OF MORE EFFECTIVE TO THE GOALS THAT WE ARE TRYING TO ACHIEVE. SOME OF THOSE HAVE NOT ENDED UP -- JUST IN THE ULTIMATE REGULATIONS PROBABLY AS EFFECTIVE AS WE ORIGINALLY HOPED.
02:25:41.673: >> Commissioner Woods: MM-HMM. OKAY. THAT'S IT.
02:25:45.377: >> Chair Milshteyn: FURTHER DISCUSSION ON THE MOTION? TO AMEND?
02:25:51.917: >> Councilmember Ackerman: AND, AGAIN, THE MOTION IS TO ALLOW FOR THE 15 AND 20% OPTIONS THAT THE DEVELOPER COULD PAY THE FULL AMOUNT OUT?
02:26:02.494: >> Chair Milshteyn: 100%. LET'S DO A ROLL CALL.
02:26:11.970: >> Planning Manager:  I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE ASKING FOR THAT.
02:26:19.077: >> Chair Milshteyn: NO.
02:26:20.612: >> Vice Chair Mills: YES.
02:26:21.179: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: NO.
02:26:23.382: >> Councilmember Ackerman: NO.
02:26:28.854: >> Commissioner Briggs: YES.
02:26:29.454: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: NO.
02:26:34.293: >> Commissioner Sauve: YES.
02:26:38.297: >> Commissioner Woods: NO.
02:26:39.398: >> Planning Manager:  MOTION FAILS.
02:26:41.833: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU. BACK TO THE MAIN MOTION. ACTUALLY, COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN AND THEN I HAVE A LIST.
02:26:51.944: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  IT SOUNDED LIKE YOU WERE ABOUT TO SAY SOMETHING, MR. LENART.
02:26:59.851: >> Planning Manager:  WHATEVER WE ARE READY, I HAVE SOME PROPOSED LANGUAGE ON THE PROPOSED FEE REIMBURSEMENT.
02:27:06.725: >> Councilmember Ackerman: EXCELLENT.
02:27:08.860: >> Chair Milshteyn: SO IN REGARDS TO -- SO THE 50% OFF APPLICATION AND THE FEES THAT THEY -- THE PLANNING FEES THAT THEY PAY, SO WHY IS IT 50% AND NOT HIGHER? IS THERE A REASON? AND I'M ALSO AS ASKING NOT JUSTR THIS BUT ALSO FOR OUR NONPROFIT PARTNERS. WHY IS IT JUST 50%? WHY ISN'T THE CITY AND THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT HOPING TO OR TRYING TO GET THAT NUMBER TO A HIGHER -- LIKE 100%?
02:27:40.993: >> Planning Manager:  I PRESUME THAT LANGUAGE WAS PUT IN PLACE TO FIND A BALANCE BETWEEN A INCENTIVE AND THE AC ACTUAL CT OF CONDUCTING THE REVIEW. THERE ARE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT. WE COULD DEFINITELY LOOK AT THAT. FOR EXAMPLE, YOU COULD LOOK AT SOMETHING THAT -- THE LANGUAGE THAT I HAVE HERE IS SUGGESTING THAT A PERCENTAGE OF THE APPLICATION FEES REQUIRED THERE ARE THIS CHAPTER WILL BE REIMBURSED TO THE PETITIONER AT A RATE BASED ON THE PERCENTAGE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS ON SITE, BASED ON THE TOTAL SQUARE FOOTAGE, UPON THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT UNITS UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THIS CHAPTER. SO IN THAT CASE, IF THE -- THOSE UNITS REPRESENTED 10% OF THE BUILDING, THEN 10% OF THE FEES WOULD BE REIMBURSED. IF YOU WERE AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROVIDER AND YOU WERE DOING 100% OF THE FEES THEN 100% OF THE FEES WOULD BE REIMBURSED.
02:28:43.455: >> Chair Milshteyn: I'M NOT ON BOARD WITH THAT.
02:28:44.689: >> Planning Manager:  OKAY.
02:28:46.625: >> Chair Milshteyn: I THOUGHT YOU WOULD COME UP WITH A MUCH HIGHER NUMBER, MAYBE SOMETHING LIKE --
02:28:52.264: >> Planning Manager:  IT COULD BE 100%!
02:28:56.368: >> Chair Milshteyn: YEAH. OR MAYBE START WITH A FLOOR THERE, YOU KNOW, MAYBE 75%, UP TO 100 BASED ON -- SO JUST OPENING THAT UP FOR DISCUSSION. THE OTHER PIECE -- AND I KNOW WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS OVER TIME AND I THINK THIS IS OUTSIDE OUR PURVIEW, BUT WATER AND SEWER CONNECTION FEES. OTHER FEES PAID TO THE CITY FOR, YOU KNOW, DEVELOPMENT OF PROJECTS. I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS SOMETHING THAT COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN CAN TAKE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH, WITH AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND TAX ABATEMENTS BUT I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WILL GET MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THESE DEVELOPMENTS AND I LIKE THE IDEA OF TAX ABATEMENTS, SOME SORT OF HELP FROM THE CITY IN REGARDS TO PROPERTY TAXES, BECAUSE THAT IS TRULY A CONCERN FOR MOST OF THE DEVELOPMENT THAT'S HAPPENING HERE. YOU KNOW, WITH POTENTIAL BUYERS AND ALSO ABOUT POTENTIAL POTENTIAL DEVELOPERSAND THERE H. IT CAN'T BE ZERO, BUT THERE HAS TO BE SOME BALANCE THERE. SO I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOMETHING. ONCE AGAIN, IT'S OUT OF OUR PURVIEW, BUT MR. ACKERMAN, IT YOU CAN TAKE THAT UP WITH STILL COUNCIL AT SOME POINT. AND THEN WITH REGARDS TO PHASING SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT WE ARE -- WE ARE MOVING FORWARD WITH ANYTHING -- SO ANYTHING THAT'S CURRENTLY BEEN SUBMITTED OR ANYTHING THAT'S SUBMITTED PRIOR TO CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL OF THIS, THEY WILL GO UNDER THE CURRENT PREMIUMS. ANYTHING AFTER CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL, IS WITH WHAT'S SET IN PLACE HERE, HOPEFULLY.
02:30:55.220: >> Planning Manager:  TYING TO TO -- TRYING TO AFFECT THAT.
02:30:59.024: >> Chair Milshteyn: I THINK THAT WOULD SUFFICE. ALL RIGHT. COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN.
02:31:04.696: >> Councilmember Ackerman: PROPOSED LANGUAGE?
02:31:07.098: >> Planning Manager:  AS I READ AND COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN DIDN'T LIKE. A PERCENTAGE OF THE APPLICATION FEE IS REQUIRED UNDER THIS CHAPTER WILL BE REIMBURSED TO THE PETITIONER, NO DISCRETION, AT A RATE BASED ON THE PERCENTAGE OF AFFORDABLE DWELLING UNITS ON SITE COMPARED TO THE TOTAL AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SO IT'S ONLY WHEN SOMETHING UNDER THIS CHAPTER REQUIRES IT. THAT PROBABLY THEN WOULDN'T APPLY TO A NONPROFIT VOLUNTARILY DOING IT. SO WE WOULD JUST SAY UNDER REQUIRED AFFORDABLE -- UNDER THE REALIZATION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING DWELLING UNITS. JUST A PROPORTION. AN EQUAL PROPORTION?
02:31:56.881: >> Planning Manager:  MY INTENTION IS THAT IF 10% OF THE BUILDING IS D DEDICATED. AND 100% IS DEDICATED, THEN 100% OF THE FEES.
02:32:10.662: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  UM I THINK -- WHAT DOES THAT DO TO YOUR BUDGET? THESE ARE COMPLEX REVIEWS AND WHO THEN IS SUBSIDIZING THAT WORK, THE TAXPAYER? WHICH GENERALLY AND FINALLY IS -- BUT WHAT DOES THAT DO TO YOUR BUDGET FROM A PRACTICAL OPERATIONAL PERSPECTIVE?
02:32:43.962: >> Planning Manager:  WE INCUR MORE COSTS THAT ARE NOT REIMBURSED. IT WOULD INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT MY BUDGET IS NOT REALIZED BECAUSE WE ARE INCURRING COSTS THAT AREN'T BEING REIMBURSED. I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT AS A CITY WE COULD TRACK AND DO OUR BEST TO -- WE COULD START LEARNING THOSE PROJECTIONS AT WHAT RATE IT'S HAPPENING AND WE COULD BEING FOR THAT IN THE BUDGETING PROCESS. AND IT HAPPENS NOW.
02:33:15.493: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER MILLS?
02:33:20.398: >> Vice Chair Mills: SO TO BE CLEAR, FOR THE BUILDING -- OR FOR THE PEOPLE WHO WOULD WANT TO TAKE ADVAN ADVANTAGE OF THE AFFE PREMIERING -- THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING PREMIUM, IT WASN'T SUCH -- THIS IS NOT AS GOOD OF A DEAL AS WHAT WAS ORIGINALLY DRAFTED. BUT FOR OTHER PEOPLE, FOR FOLKS WHO HAVE, YOU KNOW -- OUR BUILDING UNITS IN 100%, THIS CHANGE WOULD APPLY TO THEM AND IT WOULD COMPLETELY REDUCE THEIR FEED PAID TO YOUR DEPARTMENT. THERE ARE STILL LOTS OF OTHER FEES THEY WOULD BE PAYING BUT AT LEAST ON THAT -- I LIKE IT. I MEAN, I THINK IT SAYS, LIKE, YOU THINK AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS AN IMPORTANT PRIORITY FOR OUR JURISDICTION AND WE ARE GOING TO REDUCE THIS FEE AND AS COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN SAID, I THINK IT WOULD BE GREAT IF WE LOOK AT WHAT OTHER FEES WE COULD ALSO REDUCE IN PROPORTION TO REALIZE ADDITIONAL AFFORDABLE UNITS.
02:34:30.602: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER SAUVE?
02:34:32.937: >> Commissioner Sauve: WHAT IF IT WAS 50% ON BASE? IF YOU REALIZE 60% OF THE SITE, YOU GET 60% CREDIT, 100% ON SITE, YOU GET 100% CREDIT. SO IT'S BETWEEN 50% AND 100% REIMBURSEMENT IN THAT, INSTEAD OF THE -- YOU KNOW, 0 TO 100% RANGE. SO WE ARE STILL AT A 50% BASELINE FOR EVERYBODY. YOU CAN GROW IT FROM THERE, THAT INCENTIVIZES MORE ON SITE. KIND OF. LIKE, REALLY, YOU ARE GOING TO END UP  WITH 50% FOR THESE DEVELOPMENTS AND ANYBODY DOING 100% AFFORDABLE HOUSING, THEY WILL GET THE 100% CUT. SO NOBODY WILL GET LESS THAN 50%. SO I CAN'T IMAGINE SOMEONE SAYING LET'S GET  75% UNITS SO E GET A DEAL ON PLANNING UNITS, BUT AT LEAST IT'S SMALLER, RIGHT?
02:35:26.357: >> Chair Milshteyn: I WOULD BE GOOD WITH THAT. COMMISSIONER WOODS.
02:35:31.629: >> Commissioner Woods: I THINK THAT'S RIGHT. I THIS AT THE WAS VERY HEROIC TO HOLD YOUR DEPARTMENT OUT THERE AND SAY, WE'LL DO IT. NO, BUT I THINK HAVING THAT -- THE BASE OF THE 50% GOING UP MAMAKES A LITTLE MORE SENSE. AND YOU ARE STILL -- YOU ARE LIKE SQUEEZING YOUR EYES. IT'S LIKE AM I AW I AWAKE OR ASP RIGHT NOW #.
02:35:58.690: >> Planning Manager:  SO THE INTENTION IS 50% OF THE APPLICATION FEES WOULD BE REEMBURSED IF 50% OF THE AFFORDABLE UNITS ARE PROVIDED OF THE AMENITY? SPACE?
02:36:12.971: >> Vice Chair Mills: ON SITE.
02:36:13.972: >> Commissioner Woods: ON SITE.
02:36:14.739: >> Planning Manager:  AND WE REQUIRE AT LEAST 50%. IF YOU WERE TO PROVIDE 100% -- [ OFF MICROPHONE COMMENTS ]
02:36:24.415: >> Planning Manager:  100% REIMBURSED. AND HOW THAT APPLIES TO A NONPROFIT PROVIDER THAT IS NOT TOUCHING PREMIUMS THAT CURRENTLY GETS 50%.
02:36:33.024: >> Commissioner Sauve: THEY ARE DOING 100% AFFORDABLE HOUSING, 100% FEE.
02:36:37.629: >> Planning Manager:  OKAY SO 100% OF THE REQUIREMENT OR --
02:36:41.499: >> Commissioner Sauve: OR THE OVERALL.
02:36:42.834: >> Planning Manager:  OKAY.
02:36:44.502: >> Commissioner Sauve: IF IT'S NOT PART OF THE PREMIUM. SO IF YOU ARE -- EVEN IF YOU ARE -- [ OFF M MICROPHONE COMMENTS ] [ LAUGHTER ]
02:37:06.691: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: YEAH, RIGHT FOR THE $15,000 THAT THEY WILL SAVE.
02:37:10.194: >> Chair Milshteyn: THAT SOUNDS GREAT.
02:37:12.664: >> Commissioner Sauve: I DON'T KNOW IF THAT -- IF WE WROTE THAT LANGUAGE INTO THIS ORDINANCE, WOULD IT APPLY TO THINGS OUTSIDE OF PREMIUM OR NONPROFIT? WE WOULD HAVE TO WRITE IT SO THAT IF NONPROFIT -- WHICH IS OUTSIDE OF PREMIUM, HOW THEY GET THE REIMBURSEMENT. OR IS THAT -- THAT'S IN A SUBSET?
02:37:29.714: >> Planning Manager:  SO RIGHT NOW, IT HAS -- THAT LANGUAGE IS NOT IN THE PROOEMIUM LANGUAGE. IT JUST APPLIES GENERALLY. SO WHEN YOU MAKE APPLICATION TO THE CITY AND YOU ARE PROVIDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING, YOU CAN GET UP TO 50% OF YOUR FEES REDUCED UNDER THIS CHAPTER. AND SO THE QUESTION I RAISED IS THAT WE ARE -- WE ARE -- I'M SURE THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE THAT DISAGREES WITH US, BUT WE ARE GIVING SOMETHING IN EXCHANGE FOR PROVIDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THE PETITIONER IS CHOOSING TO INVOKE THOSE AND I DON'T -- MY QUESTION AT THE OUTSET, DO WE NEED TO REIMBURSE THAT COST AT CALL? THEY DON'T HAVE TO SEEK THIS. THE INTENTION, I THINK IS -- IS DEFINITELY BEEN APPLIED MORE TO NONPROFITS. IT'S ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS WITH THE CITY COUNCIL. SO MY INITIAL THOUGHT IS DO YOU WANT TO AFFORD THE OPPORTUNITY FOR A PROJECT THAT HAS 37,000 SQUARE FEET OF AFFORDABLE UNITS OR -- OR 1700 SQUARE FEET OF AFFORDABLE UNITS TO BE ABLE TO GO TO CITY COUNCIL AND ASK FOR FEE REDUCTION OUT OF A 37,000-FOOT BUILDING?
02:38:57.769: >> Commissioner Sauve: IF WE CAN'T REDUCE THESE OTHER HUGE SUBSTANTIAL THINGS, EVEN IF IT'S SMALL AMOUNT, BUT IT'S ANOTHER LITTLE PERK, I THINK IT'S WORTH DOING. LIKE EVEN IF IT'S JUST LIKE -- LIKE THAT'S THE KIND OF DROP IN THE BUCKET OF UNITS, BUT IT'S A DROP OF THE BUCKET IN TERMS THE FINANCIALS AS WELL. AND I THINK THAT'S A PROPORTIONAL BALANCE AND THEN WE CAN PLAY IT ACROSS THE BOO FOR FOR -- BOARD FOR THE PREMIUMS AND THE NONPROFITS AND THE OTHER DEVELOPMENTS THAT WANT TO INCLUDE IT IN THEIR PROJECTS JUST BECAUSE.
02:39:30.134: >> Planning Manager:  AND JUST AS A REMINDER, DOING SOME RESEARCH, I THINK SOME OF THE LAST APPROVALS OF THIS HAVE BEEN IN THE RANGE OF $8,000 TO $12,000 FOR OTHER PROJECTS, WHEN IT'S 50%. SO -- I MEAN EVERY PROJECT IS CALCULATED A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY, BUT -- BUT BY TENS OF THOUSANDS WHEN I SAID THAT, IT'S PROBABLY MORE LIKE 10 OR 10S OF THOUSANDS.
02:39:54.926: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN.
02:39:55.860: >> Councilmember Ackerman: I'M GOING TO MOVE MR. LENART'S LANGUAGE.
02:40:00.631: >> Chair Milshteyn: DO WE HAVE A SECOND? SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER MILLS. AND SO THAT LANGUAGE HAS NO FLOOR. JUST THE PERCENTAGE OF --
02:40:20.384: >> Planning Manager:  THE PERCENTAGE OF AFFORDABLE UNITS RELATIVE TO THE OVERALL DEVELOPMENT WOULD CREATE A PERCENTAGE IN WHICH WE WOULD REIMBURSE THE APPLICATION FEES.
02:40:31.896: >> Commissioner Woods: DID YOU SAY PERCENTAGE OF AFFORDABLE UNITS OR SQUARE FEET.
02:40:35.933: >> Planning Manager: PERCENTAGE OF THE -- YEAH, THE SQUARE FOOTAGE -- THE PERCENTAGE OF AREA OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING DWELLING UNITS ON SITE COMPARED TO THE TOTAL SQUARE FOOTAGE.
02:40:52.183: >> Commissioner Woods: OKAY.
02:40:52.784: >> Chair Milshteyn: ALL RIGHT. IT'S BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED. LET'S DO A ROLL CALL VOTE ON THAT.
02:41:04.195: >> Chair Milshteyn: NO.
02:41:04.829: >> Vice Chair Mills: YES.
02:41:05.396: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: NO.
02:41:07.532: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES.
02:41:11.536: >> Commissioner Briggs: YES.
02:41:12.136: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: NO.
02:41:17.074: >> Commissioner Sauve: NO.
02:41:21.179: >> Commissioner Woods: YES.
02:41:23.648: >> Planning Manager:  MOTION FAILS.
02:41:28.085: >> Chair Milshteyn: SO NOW NOBODY GETS ANYTHING. [ LAUGHTER ]
02:41:30.655: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  I MOVE THAT -- CAN YOU DRAFT LANGUAGE THAT THAT EVERYONE GETS 50% REIMBURSEMENT IF THEY INCLUDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING ON SITE?
02:41:43.067: >> Planning Manager:  THAT'S HOW IT WILL GET PRESENTED TO YOU.
02:41:47.738: >> IT'S NOT PROPROS PROPORTIONAO ANYTHING.
02:41:53.344: >> Commissioner Woods: WHEN WAS THE PERCENT? I'M SORRY.
02:41:55.546: >> Planning Manager:  50%.
02:41:57.615: >> Commissioner Woods: WE THOUGHT YOU SAID 2.
02:42:00.651: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  SO RIGHT NOW IT READS THAT ANY DEVELOPMENT WILL BE SUBJECT TO THESE UPON CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL. WE DISCUSSED --
02:42:12.496: >> Planning Manager:  IT SAYS APPLICATION FEES MAY BE ARE E DEUCED BY APPLICATION OF THE CITY COUNCIL BUT NOT MORE THAN 50% OF THE SPECIFIED FEES AND BASED ON THE FINDING THAT THEY WILL PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING DWELLING UNITS.
02:42:30.882: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  IS THE BEST COURSE OF ACTION MAKING IT A SHELL?
02:42:37.154: >> Planning Manager:  NO, YOU COULD SAY 50% OF SPECIFIED APPLICATION FEES WILL BE REIMBURSED IF AFFORDABLE --
02:42:44.328: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  SO MOVED.
02:42:49.233: >> Chair Milshteyn: DO WE HAVE A SECOND? COMMISSIONER BRIGGS? ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION? MR. LENART, CAN YOU REMIND US WHAT WE ARE VOTING ON RIGHT NOW?
02:43:06.784: >> Planning Manager: APPLICATION UP TO 50% OF THE SPECIFIED FEES ASSOCIATED WITH THIS CHAPTER WILL BE REIMBURSED FOR ANY DEVELOPMENT THAT PROVIDES AFFORDABLE HOUSING DWELLING UNITS.
02:43:18.362: >> Chair Milshteyn: GREAT. DISCUSSION? ALL THOSE IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED?
02:43:27.905: >> Councilmember Ackerman: OKAY. THEN THE PIECE THAT I WAS ASKING ABOUT WAS THE PHASING OF THIS, OR THE --
02:43:35.646: >> Planning Manager:  YES, I WOULD SEND THAT AS A RECOMMENDATION. I DON'T KNOW THAT'S LONG OF THE PLANNING COMMISSION. THAT'S ABOUT IMPLEMENTATION. SO WHAT I -- WELL, WHAT I WILL -- I GUESS WHAT I WOULD TAKE FROM THAT IS PROBABLY WORKING WITH THE CITY ATTORNEY TO FIND THE APPROPRIATE WAY, WHETHER THAT'S AN IN ACTION PROCESS OR IF IT SHOULD BE AN AMENDMENT TO THE LANGUAGE THAT YOU ARE APPROVING HERE BUT THE INTENTION WILL BE THAT -- I THINK WHAT I'M HEARING IS THAT WE WILL PROBABLY ACTUALLY ADOPT IT UNDER THE NORMAL SCHEDULE BUT THAT DATE WILL BE THE TRIGGER THAT ANYTHING THAT HAS BEEN SUBMITTED FOR SITE PLAN REVIEW AFTER THAT DATE WOULD BE SUBJECT TO IT.
02:44:17.188: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER MILLS?
02:44:18.622: >> Vice Chair Mills: JUST TO REMIND ALL OF US THAT ARE NOT CITY COUNCILMEMBERS ABOUT, LIKE, WHAT HAPPENS ONCE IT PASSES THIS BODY. WE ARE STILL TALKING A COUPLE OF MONTHS FROM NOW. IS THERE TWO READINGS OF THIS OR IS THERE ONLY ONE AT CITY COUNCIL?
02:44:29.800: >> Planning Manager:  SO UNDER THE NORMAL PROCESS, THIS WOULD BE SCHEDULED FOR FIRST READING AT CITY COUNCIL MEETING AND A MONTH LATER, IT WOULD BE SCHEDULED FOR SECOND READING AND THEN IT WOULD BE PUBLISHED APPROXIMATELY A WEEK LATER AND UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES, IT WOULD GO IN EFFECT 10 DAYS AFTER PUBLICATION. SO YOU ARE PROBABLY IN OCTOBER TO EARLY NOVEMBER. SO I'M GUESSING THAT DATE WILL END UP SOMEWHERE AROUND THERE.
02:44:58.829: >> Vice Chair Mills: ASSUMING THAT IT GOES FORWARD FROM US TONIGHT AND THAT IT'S THE KIND OF NORMAL THING THROUGH THE CITY COUNCIL?
02:45:04.535: >> Planning Manager:  CORRECT.
02:45:07.004: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN. ZZAC.>> Councilmember Ackerman: BUT TO CLARIFY. IF THE CITY COUNCIL PASSES A ZONING COMMISSION CHANGE. IT'S STILL SUBJECT TO THE NEW REGULATIONS. SO IT WOULD BE A DEVIATION FROM OUR STANDARD POLICY ON HOW WE ENACT ZONING CHANGES THAT WE WOULD SAY FOR THE CASE OF THIS INSTANCE --
02:45:34.131: >> Planning Manager:  YEAH.
02:45:35.166: >> Councilmember Ackerman: ANYTHING THAT WAS SUBMITTED. IT WOULD THE LANGUAGE INTO THE ORDINANCE THAT SAYS THIS SHOULD BE AFFORDED TO ANY PROPERTY. THAT'S WHY I WANTED TO WORK WITH THE CITY ATTORNEY BECAUSE I PREFER NOT TO HAVE A PARALLEL OF BOTH PREMIUMS BEING MAINTAINED IN THE U.D.C. I WANT TO FIGURE OUT RIGHT WAY THAT MAKES TEE CHANGES TO THE ORDINANCE BUT PROVIDES THE PROTECTION TO THOSE APPLICATIONS THAT WILL SORT OF RECEIVE THAT BENEFIT BASED ON THEIR SUBMITTAL DATE. I DON'T KNOW AT THIS POINT IF THAT WOULD BE THROUGH SOME AGNE ADDED TO THE TEXT OF THE U.D.C. THE SIMPLEST WAY IS TO KEEP THE PREMIUMS AS THEY ARE AT A NEW PREMIUM SECTION AND SAY IT GOES AWAY AFTER THIS DATE AND THAT SEEMS CLUNKY TO ME. I WANT TO FIGURE OUT OF THE BEST WAY TO MEMORIALIZE THAT EFFECTIVE DATE.
02:46:29.820: >> Councilmember Ackerman: DOES THAT NEED TO BE IRONED OUT FOR US TO APPROVE OR A CITY COUNCIL CONSIDERATION?
02:46:36.427: >> Planning Manager:  I THINK IT'S A CITY COUNCIL. I WILL COMMUNICATE THAT THE PLANNING COMMISSION SUPPORTS THAT PHASED IN APPROACH, AND I WOULD, AGAIN, WORK WITH THE ATTORNEY'S OFFICE TO FIGURE OUT THE MOST CLEAR AND EFFECTIVEWAY TO IMPLEMENT THAT.
02:46:52.610: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  SO WITH THAT, ARE THERE ANY OTHER OUTSTANDING ISSUES THAT WE HAVEN'T VOTED ON?
02:46:57.781: >> Chair Milshteyn: NO, BUT I WANT TO DISCUSS THAT ISSUE A LITTLE BIT FURTHER? IS THERE ANY WAY -- I WOULD FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE IF WE ADDED SOMETHING TO THE MOTION THAT'S BEFORE US THIS EVENING, THAT STATES SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT THAT WE WANT THIS TO BE PHASED. SO SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT THAT IT WILL -- THAT WE -- THAT THE PLANNING COMMISSION WOULD LIKE THIS TO BE PHASED IN FOR ANY PROJECTS THAT ARE SUBMITTED AFTER CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL.
02:47:28.479: >> Planning Manager:  THAT'S FINE.
02:47:31.749: >> Chair Milshteyn: BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE IT HANGING THERE, ALTHOUGH I TRUST STAFF AND I TRUST OUR CITY COUNCIL REPRESENTATIVE WILL PRESENT THIS BEFORE IT. I WOULD FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE IF WE CAN PROVIDE LANGUAGE TO THE MAIN MOTION THAT STATES SOMETHING IN REGARDS THAT THIS WILL TAKE EFFECT UPON CITY COUNCIL -- FOR ANY -- ANY PROJECTS SUBMITTED AFTER THE DATE OF CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL. SO I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE THAT. SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER MILLS.
02:48:10.888: >> Commissioner Woods: JUST A QUESTION.
02:48:13.057: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER WOODS.
02:48:14.758: >> Commissioner Woods: DOES SOMETHING LIKE THAT ACTUALLY GO AS PART OF A COVER MEMO? BECAUSE IT'S NOT -- IT WOULDN'T ACTUALLY BE BINDING UPON COUNCIL COUNCIL, CORRECT?
02:48:26.704: >> Planning Manager:  THE RECOMMENDATION WOULD GO TO CITY COUNCIL AND IN CRAFTING THE PACKAGE THAT GOES TO CITY COUNCIL, THAT'S WHERE I WILL BE WORKING TO FIND THE MOST APPROPRIATE WAY TO MEMORIALIZE THAT, SO THAT IT'S EFFECTIVE. MY INITIAL THOUGHT WAS TO DO IT THROUGH THE EFFECTIVE DATE BUT WE NEED TO BE CLEAR THAT IN AMENDING THE ORDINANCE, WE ARE SORT OF NOT MAKING THE EXISTING PREMIUMS ELIMINATED FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME. SO THAT'S WHAT I JUST WANT TO TALK THROUGH WITH, WITH THE ATTORNEY'S OFFICE TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT -- I -- I FEEL LIKE I HAVE A CLEAR SENSE OF THE INTENTION AND I DON'T -- I DON'T AT THIS POINT KNOW THE BEST WAY THAT IT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO BE MEMORIALIZED EITHER IN THE ORDINANCE LANGUAGE THAT'S EVENTUALLY INCORPORATED INTO THE U.D.C. OR THROUGH SOME OTHER MECHANISM.
02:49:19.323: >> Commissioner Woods: OKAY.
02:49:19.923: >> Planning Manager:  BUT IN SHORT, IT WILL BE ACCOMPANIED IN THE RECOMMENDED WAY AFTER THAT CONSULTATION BEFORE CITY COUNCIL CONSIDERATION.
02:49:27.531: >> Commissioner Woods: OKAY. THANK YOU.
02:49:29.667: >> Chair Milshteyn: SO THE MOTION HAS BEEN SECONDED. ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION ON THE PHASING MOTION? ALL OF THOSE IN FAVOR, PLEASE SAY AYE. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED WE ARE NOW BACK TO THE AMENDED MAIN MOTION. WHO SECONDED THAT?
02:49:45.516: >> Planning Manager:  I'M SORRY. I MISSED IT.
02:49:48.485: >> Chair Milshteyn: MISSIONER MILLS. -- COMMISSIONER MILLS.
02:49:52.056: >> Planning Manager:  SO THE ORDINANCE AS PRESENTED AMENDING THE MOTION TO CLARIFY THE PHASING AND PROVIDING AN AUTOMATIC REIMBURSEMENT OF 50% OF THE FEES WHEN AFFORDABLE HOUSING DWELLING UNITS ARE REALIZED.
02:50:15.479: >> Chair Milshteyn: ALL RIGHT. ARE WE READY FOR A VOTE? ALL RIGHT. ALL THOSE IN FAVOR, PLEASE SAY AYE. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. AND WE WILL TAKE A FIVE-MINUTE BREAK. [ BREAK ]
02:57:11.794: >> Chair Milshteyn: THE SHELL STATION PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT MODIFICATIONS FOR CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL. WE WILL BEGIN WITH THE PETITIONER PRESENTATION. THE PETITIONER WILL HAVE UP TO 10 MINUTES TO PRESENT AND THEN WE'LL GO TO STAFF FOR THEIR UPDATE AND THEN WE'LL OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING AND THEN DISCUSSION. SO WE'LL GET STARTED.
02:57:28.879: >> TODD QUATTRO, WITH QUATTRO CONSTRUCTION. AND WE WERE HERE AT THE LAST MEETING GOING THROUGH SOME -- GOING OVER THE PROJECT AT HAND. IT'S AT THE CORNER OF ANN ARBOR SALINE ROAD, THE SHELL STATION. WE ARE PROPOSING TO PUT AN ADDITION ON THE SIDE APPROXIMATELY 4,000 SQUARE FEET, AND INFILL THE DETENTION POND OVER TO THE SIDE FOR ADDITIONAL PARKING. BASICALLY THIS IS THE CONSTRUCTION LIMIT AREA, AND MOST OF IT IS GOING TO BE EITHER RERETAIL OR OFFICE. AT THE LAST MEETING, WE SEEMED TO HAVE SOME -- I'M SORRY. I'M HAVING A HARD TIME SEEING UP THERE. SO ISSUES THAT AROSE OVER THE PARKING. SO WHAT I DID IS I RAN A COUPLE OF SCENARIOS. SCENARIO ONE WAS THE PARKING SPACES SITTING WITH JUST THE ADDITION BEING RETAIL, STORAGE, OFFICE, AS IT SITS. AND AS YOU CAN SEE, WE GOT ENOUGH PARKING, WE HAVE MORE SPACES. THEN SCENARIO TWO, WOULD BE JUST TAKING THE END CAP AND MAKING THAT A RESTAURANT. AND AS YOU CAN SEE THROUGH SCENARIO TWO, IT DOESN'T WORK. SO THERE WAS DISCUSSION AT THE LAST MEETING AS TO WHETHER -- WHETHER THEY COULD HAVE A RESTAURANT AND WHAT TO DO IF THEY HAVE A RESTAURANT OR NOT RESTAURANT. AND THEN SCENARIO THREE IS IF THE WHOLE SPACE WAS JUST OFFICE, ALONG WITH THE STORAGE FOR THE EXISTING GAS STATION. ALSO THERE WAS AN ISSUE THAT EVERYBODY SEEMED TO BE SPLIT ON, WHETHER TO PUT A FENCE. SO WE PROPOSED TO PUT A FENCE ALONG THE FEAR OF THE BUILDING ONLY AND NOT EXTEND IT ANY FURTHER. IT SEEMED EVERYBODY HAD A FEELING THERE WAS A GREAT BIG DROP OFF IN THE BACK. SO I DID TAKE A FEW PICTURES SO YOU CAN KIND OF SEE WHAT'S GOING ON HERE AND THAT IS TRULY A 3% GRADIENT. SO IT'S ACTUALLY LEVEL, IF YOU SEE THE SHOTS THAT I PUT IN HERE AND I PUT THE CONTOURS IN THERE. THE FINISHED FLOOR GRADE IS ACTUALLY LEVEL RIGHT WITH THE BUILDING ALL THE WAY THROUGH THIS. THERE'S 40 -- 48.5 FEET FROM THE BACK OF THE BUILDING, 48.5 FEET THERE AND THERE IS A 3-FOOT DROP FROM THERE TO THE BACK OF THE CURB. AND THAT GIVES ABOUT A 3% GRADIENT. WHAT YOU SEE IN A LOT OF YOUR -- YOUR PARKING LOTS FOR BIG MALLS AND STUFF LIKE THAT. THEY CAN GO UP TO 4%. SO IT'S PRETTY FLAT. AND AS YOU CAN SEE IN THE CENTER, WHERE I'M GOING FROM THE BUILDING, TOWARDS THE ROAD, SHOOTING SOUTH, IT GETS LESS AND LESS AS YOU GET CLOSER TO THE ROAD. SO THAT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY FLAT BACK THERE, WHERE THE CROSSING IS. ALSO, THERE WAS A REQUEST THAT WE CHANGED THE THE LANDSCAPE, THE PUSHES, THE U, AND WE DID. WE CHANGED IT TO A MORE SALT TALLERRANT SPECIES THAT THE LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTURE GAVE US. AND THE -- THE -- I THINK WITH THE PHOTOMETRIC CAME UP. SO WHAT WE DID IS THE CANOPY AND THE LIGHTS WERE ALL RETROFITTED TO L.E.D., QUITE SOMETIME AGO, ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF AGO. I EXTRACTED ALL THE INFORMATION THAT I COULD FROM THEM AND I PUT TOGETHER A PHOTOMETRIC PLAN AND THE LIGHTING WE DID HAVE, THEY CHANGED OUT ALL THE CANOPY. I DIDN'T REALLY HAVE A LOT OF INFORMATION ON THE BACK LIGHT. I ALSO TOOK AIL PICTURE OF IT, AS I KNOW YOU WERE WORRIED ABOUT THE DARK SKY INITIATIVE. SO YOU CAN SEE THAT THEY ARE RECESSED LENSES, DIRECTED DOWNWARD. AND THIS ONE IS A RECESSED LENS DIRECTED DOWNWARD. THIS IS THE EXISTING POLL. THIS POLL RIGHT HERE, WHERE GREEN THING IS, THAT'S A RELOCATED POLL. SO THAT'S ONE OF THESE. THAT'S DIRECTED JUST STRAIGHT DOWNWARD AND THEN WE HAD CANNED LIGHTS ON THE BUILDING AND THE CANNED LIGHTS ON THE BUILDING WERE DOWNWARD DIRECTED AS WELL. SO I THINK AS A WHOLE, EVERYTHING IS GOING STRAIGHT DOWN. NOW, THE CANOPY ITSELF IS BACKLIT. THAT WAS AN EXISTING CONDITION ON THE CANOPY, AND IT GO DOWN A LITTLE BIT, NOT NECESSARILY GO UP. THAT'S ABOUT IT.
03:02:51.668: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU. WE WILL NOW GO TO MR. CHENG FOR THE STAFF REPORT. [ OFF MICROPHONE COMMENTS ]
03:03:16.126: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU. AT THIS TIME, I WOULD LIKE TO OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING FOR ANYBODY IN THE AUDIENCE WHO WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION IN REGARDS TO THIS PETITION. IS THERE ANYONE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION? ANYBODY? YOU HAVE UP TO THREE MINUTES TO SPEAK TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION. ON THIS ITEM. SEEING NO ONE, I WILL READ THE MOTION. THE ANN ARBOR PLANNING COMMISSION RECOMMENDS THAT THE CITY COUNCIL AND MAYOR, PASS THE SHELL STATION PUD MODIFICATION. MOVED BY ACKERMAN AND SECONDED BY SAUVE. WE ARE IN DISCUSSION. COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN.
03:03:55.932: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  I WANTED TO SAY THANK YOU. YOU ARE VERY HONEST AND SINCERE IN NOTING YOUR MISTAKE ABOUT THE TECHNICAL DRAWINGS LAST TIME AND THE OFFICE'S MISTAKE, BUT YOU HAVE BEEN NOTHING BUT RESPONSIVE IN YOUR WORK WITH CIRCLE K AND HERE. I WANTED TO SAY THANK YOU. IT'S DIFFERENT A LOT OF THE PETITIONERS THAT WE GET. THIS MEETS ALL OF MY STUFF BUT I KNOW THERE MAY BE SOME COLLEAGUES WITH QUESTIONS.
03:04:25.862: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL.
03:04:27.263: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN QUICKLY. YOUR SLOPE CALCULATION IS INCORRECT. IT'S ACTUALLY 6% NOT 3%.
03:04:43.613: >> IIT CAME UP 3.25.
03:04:52.855: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: IT'S STILL STEEPER THAN WHAT AN A.D.A. -- WHAT ANYONE WOULD ALLOW WITH THE SIDEWALK. I WON'T GET INTO QUIBBLING WITH THE FENCE. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT SHOULD BE ON THE SITE PLANS. YOU SHOULD GO BEYOND THE AND SHOW WHAT THE GRADES ARE. THAT'S JUST PART OF WHAT A SURVEY SHOULD BE FOR EVERY SINGLE SITE PLAN THAT COMES THROUGH AND SO THERE ARE A LOT OF ISSUES WITH YOUR DESIGN IN THE FIRST PLACE WITH NOT SHOWING WHAT WAS REQUIRED. AND SO I JUST WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT LIKE WHEN PETITIONERS COME THROUGH, THAT ALL OF THOSE BOXES ARE CHECKED, BECAUSE THE PEOPLE THAT COME -- LIKE, I HAVE NO GO TO THE OTHER SIDE TOO AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE BOXES ARE CHECKED. YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO GO BEYOND, YOU KNOW -- I THINK IT'S 50 FEET BEYOND THE PROPERTY LINE FOR ANY NATURAL FEATURES.
03:05:50.747: >> TYPICALLY WE GO 100%.
03:05:51.948: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: WE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO EVALUATE THAT THE FIRST TIME AROUND. THE FACT THAT YOU ARE PUTTING UP A FENCE, THAT'S FINE, BUT I JUST ALSO -- I FEEL LIKE WE NEED TO HAVE STANDARDS AROUND WHAT WE SUBMIT TOO. AND SO I WISH IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DONE RIGHT THE FIRST TIME IN TERMS OF SOME OF THE MATERIAL -- SO I WOULD LOO I CAN TO SEE THE NEXT TIME -- IN TERMS OF HOW HE PRESENT IT. I THINK THERE WERE QUITE A FEW THINGS THAT WERE LACKING AND IT STILL WASN'T, LIKE, UP TO SNUFF IN MY MIND. SO, AGAIN, I THINK I'M AT PEACE WITH PASSING THIS, BUT I STILL FEEL LIKE SOME THINGS WERE SLOPPY. THAT'S MY TWO CENTS.
03:06:41.531: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER SAUVE?
03:06:42.598: >> Commissioner Sauve: I WANT TO VERIFY THE 22-FOOT DIMENSIONS, JUST GOING INTO THE DETAILS BECAUSE I'M STILL SEEING 15 FEET IN THE SITE LAYOUT ON SHEET C3 AND THEN 20 FEET BETWEEN LINE STRIKES BY THAT DUMPSTER.
03:06:59.649: >> WHERE AT?
03:07:02.051: >> Commissioner Sauve: IT'S NOTED.
03:07:04.721: >> IT WAS A -- IT WAS DESIGNED AT 22. AND IT WAS RESUBMITTED.
03:07:15.365: >> SHEET C3?
03:07:17.600: >> Commissioner Sauve: C3, I SEE 15 FEET IN THE DOCUMENT I HAVE. AND 20 FEET --
03:07:23.339: >> I DON'T KNOW IF WE ARE LOOKING AT THE SAME --
03:07:25.808: >> Commissioner Sauve: I MEAN, I CLICKED THROUGH IT.
03:07:27.443: >> IS IT THE LAST SUBMISSION OF THE SITE PLAN?
03:07:31.547: >> Commissioner Sauve: MAYBE.
03:07:32.181: >> MINE SAYS 22 AS WELL, AND IT'S ACTUALLY CIRCLED.
03:07:35.385: >> Commissioner Sauve: OKAY. YOU ARE GOOD. SORRY. I WAS JUST CLICKING THROUGH AND DOWNLOADING MORE THINGS THAN I NEEDED TO AND MADE IT CONFUSING. I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE NOMENNOMENCLATURE TOO. I'M FINE WITH THE FENCE AS PRESENTED IN TERMS OF PUTTING IT OUT THIS FOR DISCUSSION. THAT'S THE ONLY OTHER THING, THANKS.
03:08:02.311: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER MILLS.
03:08:03.179: >> Vice Chair Mills: ON THE PARKING. THE STRIPES -- I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE STRIPES THAT YOU HAVE FOR THE PEDESTRIANS, ARE THOSE GOING THROUGH TWO SPOTS? ARE THOSE NOT CONSIDERED SPOTS? SO IF YOU -- ZOOM IN ON ON THE PARKING LOT.
03:08:19.362: >> I SEE WHICH ONE. THIS AREA?
03:08:22.398: >> Vice Chair Mills: YEAH.
03:08:23.099: >> IT WAS A DESIGNATED PATHWAY FOR CONDUCTTIVITY. THERE WAS A SIDEWALK -- THERE'S AN EXISTING SIDEWALK COMING UP TO THE -- TO THE PARKING AREA.
03:08:36.879: >> Vice Chair Mills: OKAY.
03:08:37.447: >> AND SO IT WAS A REQUEST BY STAFF THAT WE STRIPE THIS AREA AND TAKE TWO SPOTS AND MAKE THEM SMALL CAR. SO THEY COME RIGHT DOWN THE SIDE OF IT.
03:08:47.223: >> Vice Chair Mills: AT LEAST AS I'M LOOKING AT IT AND I'M KIND OF ZOOMING IN --
03:08:54.831: >> IT GOES ALONGSIDE.
03:08:56.599: >> Vice Chair Mills: IT LOOKS LIKE YOU COULDN'T FIT A -- IT LOOKS LIKE A MOTORCYCLE SPOT. SO --
03:09:05.274: >> IT IS CROSSING -- IF YOU LOOK, THERE'S A CROSSWALK GOING STRAIGHT ACROSS, GIVING CONNECTIVITY TO THE THING AND THEY REQUESTED THAT WE PUT THE HATCHWAY -- ACTUALLY, THAT WAS YOUR REQUEST, WASN'T IT, CHRIS?
03:09:22.758: >> YES.
03:09:23.226: >> Vice Chair Mills: SO THE ZIGZAG THAT I SEE?
03:09:25.261: >> YES. SO WHAT'S HAPPENING FROM THE PREVIOUS PLAN TO THIS PLAN, THEY MODIFIED THE FRONT OF THAT BUILDING. SO WAS SQUARED OFF. IT'S NO LONGER SQUARED OFF. SO THERE WAS NOTHING ON THIS THAT THEY GOT THAT OTHER LITTLE SECTION TO GO TO, THAT IS MORE OF THE REAR OF THE BUILDING THAT'S BEEN ADDED FROM THE PREVIOUS SUBMISSION. I KNEW IT WAS TIGHT OVER THERE TO MAKE THE SMALL CAR SPACES TO GIVE A PEDESTRIAN CROSSING THROUGH THERE.
03:09:54.824: >> Vice Chair Mills: OKAY. SO WHAT I'M CHECKING -- I'M ZOOMED IN ON THIS. IT LOOKS LIKE V-SHAPED EFFECTIVELY. THERE'S A WHOLE LOT OF PARKING ALONG EISENHOWER. AND THEN HOW MANY SPACES ARE YOU EXPECTING THAT THERE IS ON, LIKE ACROSS FROM ALL THE PARKING ALONG EISENHOWER. I SEE TWO FULL SPACES AND ONE SMALL CAR S. THAT IS THAT HOW IS COUNTED?
03:10:20.816: >> THAT'S CORRECT.
03:10:21.350: >> Vice Chair Mills: I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU WERE NOT COUNT THAT THERE WAS FOUR THERE. IT LOOKS LIKE THE SIZE OF A FULL PARKING LOT. YOU KNOW WHAT I -- ARE YOU SEEING KIND OF WHAT I'M SEEING? SO I JUST -- FOR THE NUMBERS AND I KNOW THAT PEOPLE -- THERE'S PARKING AT THE PUMPS. HOW MANY SHOULD THERE BE IN THAT SOUTHEASTERN MOST PARKING AREA? HOW MANY ARE YOU -- HOW MANY SPOTS ARE YOU EXPECTING?
03:10:46.909: >> THREE.
03:10:48.544: >> Vice Chair Mills: THREE AND THEN ACROSS THE WAY.
03:10:51.948: >> THERE'S 12.
03:10:53.049: >> Vice Chair Mills: ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT, NINE, TEN, ELEVEN.
03:11:00.690: >> THERE'S 12, RIGHT?
03:11:02.892: >> Vice Chair Mills: WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE THERE WERE 12 BUT --
03:11:06.128: >> SMALL ON MY THING HERE.
03:11:07.663: >> Vice Chair Mills: OKAY. YEAH. I'M JUST WANTING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE KNOW THE NUMBERS.
03:11:14.470: >> AND THEN ACROSS THE FRONT.
03:11:16.105: >> Vice Chair Mills: ACROSS THE FRONT. AND SO -- SO WE HAVE GOT 11 PLUS THREE PLUS --
03:11:22.979: >> AND THEN WE REMOVED ONE. THERE'S ONE THERE PRESENTLY THAT'S NEXT TO THIS ONE, BUT I FELT THAT WAS A LITTLE TIGHT GOING THROUGH THERE. SO I REMOVED THAT ONE. THE EXISTING ONE IF YOU EVER PULL IN THIS. YOU WILL SEE THEY ARE STRIPED OUT.
03:11:39.528: >> Vice Chair Mills: AND THEN YOU HAVE THE HANDICAPPED SPOT. YOU ARE KEEPING ONE HANDICAPPED SPOT IN FRONT OF THE EXISTING BUILDING.
03:11:48.504: >> YES.
03:11:48.771: >> Vice Chair Mills: AND THE ONE TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE, IN FRONT OF THE DRIVE THRU.
03:11:52.875: >> YEP. AND THEN THE PUMPS.
03:11:56.045: >> Vice Chair Mills: HOW MANY AT THE PUMPS?
03:12:00.116: >> THERE'S TWO PER ISLAND.
03:12:01.884: >> Vice Chair Mills: SO NOW I GET TO ADD UP ALL OF THESE NUMBERS THAT I WROTE. I ADD, BASED ON WHAT WE JUST SAID -- MY NUMBER IS 37.
03:12:10.893: >> YEAH, WE SHOWED 39, 35 REQUIRED. RIGHT?
03:12:17.233: >> Vice Chair Mills: SO I THINK -- I THINK THAT THOSE TWO SPOTS THAT ARE STRIPED ARE COUNTED AS PARKING AND THEY SHOULDN'T BE BECAUSE YOU CAN'T PARK ANYTHING THERE.
03:12:26.676: >> I'M HAVING A HARD TIME SEEING IT UP THERE. I CAN'T BLOW IT UP.
03:12:31.781: >> Commissioner Sauve: SO IF YOU ADD THEM UP, THE NUMBERS ARE OKAY. LIKE, IF THE -- IT'S JUST A NUMERIC THING, RIGHT? THE TABLE SAYS 35. IF YOU ADD THE CIRCLES OF THE 12 AND FOUR, IT ADDS UP TO MORE. SO THE STRIPED ONES ARE --
03:12:50.766: >> Vice Chair Mills: BONUS. BUT WHAT I WOULD -- WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO ME IS THAT THEY ARE STARTING WITH A SPOT THAT'S THE SAME WIDTH AS A PARKING SPOT. I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE DON'T PARK OVER THE PEDESTRIAN AREA IS WHAT I'M SAYING, BECAUSE IF YOU ARE -- IF YOU STRIPE OUT YOUR PARKING LOT, AND THEN YOU STRIPE IN THE PEDESTRIAN AREA, BUT PEOPLE CAN TELL THAT IT WAS STRIPED FOR PARKING LOT, OR PARKING SPACE, LIKE -- I DON'T WANT SOMEONE TO PARK OVER TOP OF IT.
03:13:24.567: >> YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THIS AREA. YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THIS AREA.
03:13:35.111: >> Vice Chair Mills: IT'S WIDE ENOUGH TO BE A PARKING SPACE. BECAUSE YOU HAVE A PEDESTRIAN PATHWAY IN THERE. SO WHAT WOULD YOU RECOMMEND?
03:13:44.887: >> PETITIONER COULD GO BACK AND CONVERT SOME OF THOSE SPACES AND MAYBE HE COULD JEWES IN POSSIBLY ANOTHER SPACE AND PUT -- HE COULD SQUEEZE IN POSSIBLY ANOTHER SPACE IN THERE AND GET THE PEDESTRIAN PATHWAY IN THERE.
03:14:05.741: >> AND WE CAN SHRINK IT UP JUST A LITTLE BIT WHICH IS SOMETHING I DON'T LIKE DOING BECAUSE THIS GETS SO TIGHT INSIDE THE SPACES AS IT IS. SO NORMALLY YOU ARE WALKING ACROSS -- I MEAN, THE PEOPLE GETTING OUT OF THEIR CAR RIGHT HERE, AT THE PUMP, THEY WALK ACROSS THE PARKING LOT TO GET THERE.
03:14:26.162: >> Vice Chair Mills: SURE. I THINK IT'S MORE IF THESE PARKING SPACES THAT YOU HAVE SHOWN ARE -- ARE 9 FEET OR 8 FEET WIDE, AND IT'S THE 4 FEET WALL, IT'S THE LEFT OVER 4 FEET THAT PEOPLE -- ESPECIALLY BECAUSE IT WILL BE CONCRETE. PEOPLE ARE LIKE WHAT IS THIS HERE FOR. OH, LIKE, MAYBE THAT'S STRIPES OF THE PEDESTRIAN IS JUST AN EMERGENCY OR SOMETHING. IT'S JUST WEIRD.
03:14:52.288: >> YEAH.
03:14:52.555: >> Vice Chair Mills: IT'S THE LEFTOVER SPACE THIS THAT REALLY -- I THINK IT'S CONFUSING MAYBE WHEN IT'S ACTUALLY DRAWN -- WHEN IT'S ACTUALLY BUILT.
03:15:01.797: >> I COULD LOOK AT -- I COULD LOOK AT RELOCATING IT CHRIS, MAYBE OVER HERE, COMING INTO THE FRONT OF THE BUILDING. OVER ON THE END? WE HAVE AI L A LOT OF ISLAND. I'M IN EXCESS OF LANDSCAPE.
03:15:22.484: >> IF WE MOVE THAT AROUND, IT'S IMPACTING LANDSCAPE ISLANDS. I'M JUST SAYING THIS ONE HERE IN PARTICULAR, I WAS BIG ON. BECAUSE THAT ONE I WILL BROUGHT -- I MADE A LITTLE BIT BIGGER AN I PUT A TREE IN THERE, BUT WE CAN -- IF YOU NEED THE PEDESTRIAN PATHWAY TO WALK THROUGH, LIKE I SAID, YOU ARE WALKING THROUGH THE PARKING LOT, WHEREVER YOU PARK. IF YOU PARK OVER HERE, YOU ARE WALKING THROUGH THE PARKING LOT, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. AND IT'S GOT CONNECTIVITY ALL THE WAY THROUGH ON THAT END.
03:15:55.885: >> PARTICULARLY BECAUSE ONE OF THE REASONS THAT -- THE RATIONALE FOR THIS PUD WAS PEDESTRIAN AMENITIES, I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S THERE. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT DOESN'T GET PARKED OVER. THE REASON I WENT THROUGH AND COUNTED IS BECAUSE I WAS ARE A HE WILL LeCONFUSED. BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE A PARKING SPOT. BECAUSE THE SIZE OF THE PARKING SPOT, PART OF IT IS TAKEN. MAYBE IT IS A MATTER OF VARYING WHAT WIDTH THE SPOTS ON EITHER SIDE ARE. SO YOU DON'T HAVE THIS ODD 3-FOOT, 4-FOOT, HOWEVER WIDE NOTHING SPACE OR PLANT SOMETHING THERE, RIGHT, LIKE THERE'S A LITTLE ISLAND -- I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN DO THAT, I DEFER TO OTHERS. BUT IT'S JUST A WEIRD THING AND I THINK PEOPLE MAY INTERPRET THIS AS THIS IS A SPACE THAT I MAY PARK.
03:16:51.840: >> AND LOOKING AT IT, I THINK WE SHOULD REMOVE THE STRIPE PORTION. AS YOU LOOK, IT'S GOING DIRECTLY FROM THE SIDEWALK GOING INTO THE CORNER OF THE BILLING. I DON'T THINK WE NEED THE REST OF THAT. IT WAS ORIGINALLY THERE FROM LAST REVIEW, WHEN IT WAS A SQUARED OFF BUILDING. WE COULD JUST REMOVE THAT OTHER STRIPING. THAT WILL ARE FREE UP A SPACE RIGHT THERE BECAUSE IT GOES DIRECTLY INTO THE ENTRANCE AND THE SIDEWALKS SURROUNDING THE PROPOSED BUILDING.
03:17:21.804: >> YEAH. I MEAN, THAT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING I CAN IT SIT DOWN WITH YOU ON AND MAKE THAT WORK OUT, WHATEVER -- WHEREVER YOU WANT THE PEDESTRIAN PATHWAY CROSSING.
03:17:38.954: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER COMMISSIONER SAUVE.
03:17:41.323: >> Commissioner Sauve: JUST WIDEN THE PEDESTRIAN PATH. IF IT'S TAKING UP AN 8-FOOT SPOT, MAKE IT 8 FEET WIDE AND JUST STRIPE IT 8 FEET WIDE STRAIGHT TO THE EDGE OF THE LANDING INSTEAD OF JUST HAVING A MINIMUM 5 FEET AND LEFT OVER 4 FEET, YOU DON'T HAVE TO REARRANGE PARKING, AND SCALE THINGS DOWN. YOUR COUNTS STILL COUNT.
03:18:04.346: >> THE REASON WE DIDN'T IS BECAUSE THERE SEEMED TO BE A BIG CONCERN ABOUT THE NUMBER OF PARKING SPOTS. SO WE WERE TRYING TO KEEP IT IN -- IN THAT BALL -- BALLPARK AT LEAST.
03:18:15.124: >> Commissioner Sauve: BUT YOU ARE GAINING THAT ONE WHERE YOU HAVE FOUR, IF YOU GO STRAIGHT ACROSS AND YOU ARE NOT DOING THE TURN AROUND THE CURB.
03:18:21.663: >> CERTAIN Le.
03:18:22.965: >> Commissioner Sauve: JUST LOSE THAT ONE, MAKE IT 9 FEET WIDE AND REALLY DEDICATE AND MAKE IT VISUALLY APPEALING THAT IT'S A N GET TWO WHEELCHAIRS GOING BACK AND FORTH OR WHATEVER ELSE IN A GREAT WIDE CLEARANCE. AND THEN THE LINES DON'T HAVE TO CHANGE, THE ONLY MODIFICATION IS WIDENING THAT INSTEAD OF -- I'M ALMOST CONCERNED WHAT THESE LINES WILL COME BACK AS A THIRD TIME IF THEY ARE DRAWN AGAIN SOME 8 FEET, SOME 9 FEET, SOME PEDESTRIAN PATH AND WHAT THAT COMBO WOULD BE. I WOULD JUST SAY MAKE IT 9 FEET.
03:19:02.104: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER BRIGGS.
03:19:03.472: >> Commissioner Briggs: WELL, I LOVE THE IDEA OF REALLY WIDE WALKWAYS. I WILL CERTAINLY DEFER TO WHATEVER STAFF RECOMMENDS ON THIS. I WOULD SAY THAT WHEN WE HAVE MEET 9-FOOT OR 10-FOOT BIKE LANES, THEY HAVE BECOME DRIVING LANES. IF YOU MAKE IT BIG ENOUGH FOR A CAR, SOMEONE WILL PUT A CAR THERE. I THINK THE SIZE OF THE WALKWAY ALSO ENCOURAGES THE TYPE OF USE. SO -- JUST --
03:19:35.771: >> Chair Milshteyn: SO I WOULD LIKE TO CHAT ABOUT THE FENCE.
03:19:38.640: >> OKAY.
03:19:42.978: >> Chair Milshteyn: SO CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT THE RATIONALE IS WITH REGARDS TO PUTTING A FENCE JUST BEHIND THE ADDITION AND NOT BEHIND THE EXISTING BUILDING?
03:19:53.755: >> WELL, FIRST IF YOU LOOK AT THE -- I GUESS THE PHOTOS WOULD BE THE BEST THING, THE EASIEST WAY TO SEE IT IS IF YOU LOOK AT THE PHOTOS, AS YOU GET FARTHER BEHIND THE BUILDING IS THE 6% GRADIENT, RIGHT HERE WHERE IT JUMPS OUT. SO THIS IS -- AGAIN, IT'S RELATIVELY FLAT. IT'S WALKABLE. WHEN YOU STAND HERE AND YOU LOOK TOWARDS THE SOUTH, AS YOU CAN SEE, IT GETS FLATTER AND FLATTER AND FLATTER. AND AT SOME POINT, THE SIDEWALK IS BLENDING IN WITH THE STREET OVER ON THE SIDE THERE. SO THE RATIONALE WAS IF THERE IS BACKDOORS, WE ARE REALLY NOT SURE WHO WILL OCCUPY THE BUILDING RIGHT NOW, ALTHOUGH IT DOES LOOK LIKE IT'S GOING TOWARDS AN OFFICE USE. IN THE BACK OF IT, WHEN YOU ARE -- YOU ARE COMING IN AND GOING OUT, THAT WOULD BE THE BIGGEST AREA THAT YOU WOULD HAVE FOR WHEELING IN, YOU KNOW, YOUR STORAGE MATERIAL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN THE BACK AND YOU KIND OF -- YOU GOT A TWO-WHEELED CART. SO I FELT LIKE PUTTING THE FENCE ALONG THE BACK PORTION OF THE BUILDING WOULD KEEP ANYBODY FROM, A, PARKING OVER HERE AND TRYING TO WHEEL UP WHILE THEY ARE TRYING TO OFF-LOAD SOMETHING OR GOING IN, BECAUSE THEY CAN'T GET AROUND THE FENCE. SO THAT SHOULD TAKE CARE OF THE NEIGHBOR'S CONCERN AS FAR AS THAT GOES. AND SOMEBODY WHEELING OUT AND GOING OVER AND DUMPING SOMETHING DOWN THE HILL OR THE GRADIENT THAT'S FALLING DOWN.
03:21:36.358: >> Chair Milshteyn: THEN WHY NOT EXTEND IT.
03:21:39.595: >> ALL THROUGHOUT CITY, THERE'S NO FENCES THROUGHOUT COMMERCIAL USES, THAT I SEE. THE BIG FEAR SEEMED TO BE THAT PEOPLE CAN'T WALK THIS BECAUSE THE HILL IS TOO STEEP, AND THAT'S NOT THE CASE.
03:21:54.042: >> Chair Milshteyn: NOW I SEE PEOPLE WALKING UP THAT HILL ASSUMING THAT THERE IS A SIDEWALK THAT SOMEHOW IS NOT CONNECTING TO THE PARKING LOT IN THE BACK.
03:22:00.549: >> IT IS CONNECTED OFF TO THE SIDE HERE, IT'S JUST NOT OFF THE PARKING LOT.
03:22:05.420: >> Chair Milshteyn: BUT NOW IT WILL LOOK -- I CAN SEE SOMEONE PARKING IN THE WHOLE FOODS PARKING LOT AND WALKING UP THE HILL, OH, FRIENDLY SIDEWALK NEXT TO A FENCE LINE AND THEY TAKE THE BACK SIDEWALK AROUND THE BILLBUILDING TO THE FRONT.
03:22:19.234: >> I GOT YOU.
03:22:20.936: >> Chair Milshteyn: IT ALMOST SEEMS LIKE YOU CREATED -- YOU MADE IT MORE ACCESSIBLE TO GET UP TO THE BUILDING FROM THE HILL AND THE PARKING LOT DOWN THERE. SO I WAS THINKING POTENTIALLY MOVING THE FENCE ACROSS THE ENTIRE BILL BUILDING -- THE ADDN AND THE EXISTING BUILDING WOULD MAKE SENSE THAT MAYBE IT WOULD STOP PEOPLE FROM GOING UP THE HILL AND WALKING AROUND.
03:22:44.526: >> THE BUILDING IS ACTUALLY HERE, UP TO THIS POINT. UP HERE THERE IS A SUBSTANTIAL GRADIENT. THAT'S THERE. IT GETS REAL STEEP AT THE FRONT END OF IT, THAT'S EXISTING THERE AT THIS TIME. AGAIN, WE CONCENTRATED ON THE ST. SOUTH END OF THE PROPERTY. I WASN'T LOOKING AT THE NORTH END. THAT WAS PROFUSELY APPROVED AND OPERATING AND WE -- THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY APPROVED AND OPERATING AND WE DIDN'T HAVE A FENCE BEFORE AND SO I DIDN'T PUT ONE UP NOW. CERTAINLY IT CAN BE CONSIDERED, I GUESS, AS FAR AS THAT GOES. I JUST -- SOME OF WHAT'S GOING ON IS, ACCORDING TO THE OWNER OF THE STORE, THEY BELIEVE THAT THE PEOPLE LIKE -- ESPECIALLY IN -- YOU KNOW, WHEN THERE'S BIG EVENTS GOING ON IN TOWN AND STUFF LIKE THAT, THERE'S PEOPLE WALKING ALL OVER THE PLACE AND THEY WALK -- THEY WALK FROM THE MALL NEXT TO HIM, OVER TO THEM, BACK AND FORTH, YOU KNOW, WHERE THEY ARE GETTING TIM HORTON'S AND A COFFEE OR WHETHER THEY ARE GOING BACK OVER TO THE OTHER STORE AND GRABBING SOMETHING AT ONE OF THE STORES IN THE MALLS. SO HE WOULD LIKE TO KEEP IT OPEN TO THAT. HE DOESN'T -- HE DIDN'T WANT THE FENCE IF AT ALL POSSIBLE. SO THIS WAS MY KIND OF WEIGHING OF THE TWO. SO I -- I MEAN, I GUESS IF WE WANTED MAYBE TO EXTEND IT DOWN A LITTLE BIT TO THE DUMPSTER PAD. AND KIND OF KEEP IT FROM GOING ACROSS. I SEE YOUR POINT THERE. IT'S JUST THERE'S NO -- THERE'S NO BACKDOOR HERE OR ANYTHING. THAT'S THE OLD CAR WASH THAT WAS THERE. THIS IS JUST A WALL.
03:24:31.566: >> Chair Milshteyn: WHAT I IMAGINE, IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S A PATH AN YOU CAN AROUND.
03:24:37.939: >> AND YOU COME TO THE END OF A FENCE BECAUSE THE FENCE DIES INTO THE OTHER BUILDING. IT WOULD BE LIKE A DEAD END AT THE END. AND YOU NEED SOMEBODY WALKING DOWN THERE AND SAYING, OKAY, NOW I WILL JUMP IT AND GO FROM THERE.
03:24:52.087: >> Chair Milshteyn: I DON'T KNOW IF ANY OF MY OTHER COLLEAGUES FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT IT, BUT -- COMMISSIONER HA HA HAMMERSCHMID.
03:25:04.132: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: I DON'T KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT IT. I WENT OUT THERE TODAY. IT IS A PRETTY STEEP GRADE BEHIND THE PROPOSED BILLING, BU, BEHIND THE EXISTING BUILDING, IT DIDN'T SEEM THAT BAD TO ME. I WOULD HAVE BEEN FINE WALKING UP THAT. THE FENCE AS YOU HAVE IT PROPOSED, THERE WOULD BE A SIDEWALK OR SOMETHING BETWEEN THE BUILDING AND THE FENCE MOSTLY FOR DELIVERIES?
03:25:25.053: >> YES, THERE'S A BACK WALK THERE. SO WE HAD NO FENCE.
03:25:29.157: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: RIGHT.
03:25:30.225: >> IS THE WAY IT WAS PROPOSED.
03:25:32.360: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: RIGHT.
03:25:33.762: >> AND THE NEIGHBOR TO THE EAST IS WORRIED THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO PARK IN THIS BECAUSE THERE'S NOT ENOUGH PARKING TO COME OUT TO THE FRONT. SO WE WERE TRYING TO GET AS MUCH PARKING AS WE CAN. WE DID HAVE PARKING OUT HERE IN THE -- IN THE LITTLE V AT ONE TIME. BUT WE FELT LIKE THAT WAS JUST CUTTING INTO THE LANDSCAPING AND THE LANDSCAPING IS PRETTY WELL DONE IN THAT AREA ALREADY. AND THAT -- THAT IT WASN'T CONDUCIVE PARKING TO -- IT WAS THERE TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT OR GO ABOVE THE REQUIREMENT. AS IT ALL EVOLVED, WE GOT THE PARKING OVER ON THIS PARTICULAR SIDE AND THEN THEY BROUGHT UP THE PARKING SITUATION. WE ACTUALLY ATTEMPTED AT ONE TIME TO GET CROSS ACCESS EASEMENT BETWEEN THE TWO AT THE REQUEST OF THE CITY AND IT JUST KEEPS GETTING SHUT DOWN. SO NOW -- NOW THE -- THE -- THEIR CONCERN HAS BEEN THAT PEOPLE WILL PARK HERE AND COME UP AND VISIT THIS MALL AND PARK IN THEIR PARKING LOT AND THAT THEY MIGHT TRIP OR FALL OR DO ANYTHING ELSE. THAT'S WHY I TOOK THE PICTURES. THE PICTURES REALLY -- I MEAN, IF YOU GO THERE AND YOU TAKE A LOOK, IT REALLY IS NOT STEEP AND THERE'S HILLS FAR STEEPER THAN THAT ALL OVER TOWN. SO THIS PARTICULAR AREA WAS THERE AND THEN I FIGURED WELL, THEN I WILL PUT THE FENCE BACK IN BECAUSE IT WAS A 4-4 SPLIT. FOUR PEOPLE WANTED IT AND FOUR PEOPLE DIDN'T. I DIDN'T NOM KNOW WHERE TO GO WH IT. WE WOULD BE ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO WALK BEHIND THE BUILDING AND WE REALLY DON'T WANT THEM BACK THERE BECAUSE AS WE GO FURTHER UP HERE, I MEAN IT JUST GETS INTO A FIELD ON THE NORTH END. YOU KNOW? AND THEN THIS REALLY IS A VERY STEEP SLOPE OVER IN THE CORNER WHERE CRANBROOK PUT IN THE PARKING LOT. THERE'S A BIG HILL NEXT TO IT. AND THAT IS A PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL SLOPE. I DIDN'T SHOOT THAT. I JUST WENT OUT AND GOT THE GRADES AVAILABLE.
03:27:46.661: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: I MEAN I SEEN THE FENCE AS BENEFICIAL TO THOSE WHO ARE DELIVERING FROM FALLING DOWN THE HILL. IT DOESN'T ADDRESS THE ISSUES IN THE LETTER, BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT --
03:27:58.607: >> AGAIN, EVEN --
03:27:59.641: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: I DON'T KNOW THAT IT MATTERS TO ME.
03:28:01.543: >> EVEN A 6% GRADIENT. A LOT OF THE APPROACHES YOU DRIVE ON ARE, WELL, 4. USUALLY WE TRY TO KEEP THEM 4 SO YOU DON'T HAVE A 6% DIFFERENTIAL, BUT IT'S NOT -- IT'S NOT A HILL. THIS IS --
03:28:14.489: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: YEAH.
03:28:15.457: >> THIS IS A PRETTY FLAT AREA. AND AS -- WHERE WE ARE BUILDING, THIS WILL BLOCK PEOPLE FROM WALKING ON. AS YOU GET HERE, IT'S ALMOST FLAT. I MEAN, IT GETS REAL FLAT AT THIS END. WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT UP HERE IS THIS IS -- THIS IS RIGHT WHERE THE BUILDING -- THIS IS AT THE BACK OF THE EXISTING BUILDING AND THAT'S THE WAY IT WILL LOOK RIGHT NOW. THERE IS, I THINK, TWO -- 2 INCHES DIFFERENCE. THERE'S ONE SPOT RIGHT WHERE THE -- RIGHT WHERE -- RIGHT HERE. IT WAS LIKE A LITTLE DIP THAT SHOWS IN THERE. AND IT SHOWS ON OUR OTHER DRAWING ON OUR DRAWING, DRAWING. THERE'S A LITTLE DIP THERE THAT DROPS DOWN ABOUT SIX INCHES.
03:29:03.104: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: IN YOUR LEFT PHOTO, ARE ANY OF THOSE TREES STAYING? I GUESS I PARKED IN UP WITH OF THOSE SPOTS AND I WAS JUST LOOKING UP, TRYING TO IMAGINE WOULD I WANT TO -- LIKE, I -- AGAIN, LIKE THERE WASN'T A BUILDING THERE, OBVIOUSLY, BUT I FELT LIKE -- I MEAN, THERE WAS JUST SORT OF A BARRIER. I WOULDN'T NECESSARILY DO THAT. LIKE, ARE THE TREES GOING TO STAY? ARE THEY ALL COMING DOWN.
03:29:26.761: >> THE TREES UNDER -- EVERYTHING UNDER THE BILL BUILDING IS COMIG OUT. YOU PARKED RIGHT HERE?
03:29:34.202: >> NO, I WAS IN THE CRANBROOK LOT. I WAS THE BOTTOM OF THE HILL.
03:29:38.206: >> YEAH, MOST OF THESE TREES ARE ALL COMING OUT RIGHT HERE. AND THEN THERE'S NEW LANDSCAPING BEING DEVELOPED IN THE BACK AREA. THERE'S SOME PLANTINGS AN A COUPLE OF TREES BACK HERE AND NEW STREET TREES COMING IN.
03:29:50.785: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: BUT ON YOUR SLOPE, THAT'S NOT THE PROPERTY -- THAT'S CRANBROOK'S PROPERTY. I THINK THE FENCE IS FINE, BUT MORE OF A BENEFIT FOR THIS PROPERTY THEN, ADDRESSING CRANBROOK'S ISSUE.
03:30:06.601: >> YEAH, I AGREE WITH YOU THERE, AS FAR AS THAT GOES. I MEAN, I'M JUST --
03:30:11.539: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: BUT I THINK FOR SAFETY ISSUES FOR YOUR PROPERTY, IT MAKES SENSE.
03:30:15.110: >> I TOTALLY TALKED WITH THE OWNER OF THE PROPERTY, AND DISCUSSED THAT WITH HIM AS HE WAS -- THERE'S -- THERE'S JUST BEEN A LOT OF DEMANDS ABOUT 7-FOOT HIGH FENCES AND STUFF GOING THROUGH AND IT WOULD LOOK GAUDY, AND I DON'T REMEMBER WANTS A WROUGHT IRON 7-FOOT HIGH FENCE RUNNING DOWN TWO PROPERTIES AND GRABBING GARBAGE AND EVERYTHING INTO IT. THIS WAS THE COMPROMISE.
03:30:45.039: >> Chair Milshteyn: FURTHER DISCUSSION? READY FOR A VOTE? ALL THOSE IN FAVOR, PLEASE SAY AYE. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED.
03:30:54.649: >> ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU.
03:30:56.151: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU. MOVING ON TO THE NEXT ITEM ON OUR AGENDA. THIS IS PART OF OUR REGULAR BUSINESS, APPROVAL PLANNING COMMISSION SUBCOMMITTEE AND DESIGNEE ASSIGNMENTS. MR. LENART.
03:31:15.436: >> Planning Manager:  WHEN YOU JOINED THE PLANNING COMMISSION, HE TYOU THOUGHT THAT YOU WOULD ATTEND TWO REGULAR MEETINGS AND ONE WORKING SESSION A MONTH, BUT LUCKY FOR YOU, THERE IS MORE! SO THE PLANNING COMMISSION HAS IN THE BYLAWS -- WHICH BY THE WAY, I'M STILL WORKING ON CHANGES. THEY WILL BE PRESENTED TO YOU SOON. SPECIFIES THAT THE PLANNING COMMISSION CAN ESTABLISH SUBCOMMITTEES TO CONDUCT THE WORK IT IS TASKED WITH. YOU -- YOUR CURRENT SLATE OF SUBCOMMITTEES IS AFFORDABLE HOUSING, MASTER PLAN REVIEW, ORDINANCE REVISIONS AND EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE. EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE SORT OF TAKING CARE OF ITS OWN. IT'S THE CHAIR, THE VICE CHAIR, AND THE SECRETARY. THE ORDINANCE REVISIONS COMMITTEE TYPICALLY MEETS EVERY FOURTH TUESDAY OF THE MONTH. THAT IS OFTEN THE FIRST SOUNDING BOARD OR ROLLING UP SLEEVES TO WORK ON ORDINANCE LANGUAGE TO EVENTUALLY BE PRESENTED TO THE FULL PLANNING COMMISSION FOR CONSIDERATION. MASTER PLAN REVIEW COMMITTEE HAS BEEN PRETTY DORMANT BUT ON THE CONTEXT OF A COUPLE OF THE MEMBERS ARE ACT ENVIRONMENTALLY WORKING ON OUR RFP EVALUATION TEAM AND SHOULD THAT WORK GO FORWARD, I WOULD ANTICIPATE THAT COMMITTEE IS GOING TO HAVE A FAIRLY HEAVY LOAD OVER THE CUCOMING YEARS. AND THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING COMMITTEE WAS ESTABLISHED BY PLANNING COMMISSION AND THE HOUSING HUMAN SERVICES ADVISORY BOARD. ADDITIONALLY, THE PLANNING COMMISSION REGULARLY DESIGNATES REPRESENTATIVES TO A VARIETY OF OTHER CITY BOARDS, SPECIFICALLY THE D.D.A. PARTNERSHIPS COMMITTEE, THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION, CURRENTLY SERVED THAT ROLE -- THAT ROLE SERVED BY COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL, THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION, THAT WAS MOST RECENTLY SERVED BY COMMISSIONER TRUDEAU, WHO WAS NOT REAPPOINTED BY THE PLANNING COMMISSION. SO WE DON'T HAVE A DESIGNEE AND THEN THE ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS THAT'S NOT AN APPOINTMENT THAT THE PLANNING COMMISSION MAKES, BUT WE DO INCLUDE IT THAT IS NOMINATED BY THE MAYOR AND RATIFIED BY THE MAYOR AND THE CITY COUNCIL. THE ZONING BOARD OF APPEALING DOESN'T HAVE A PLANNING COMMISSIONER BUT IT DOES HAVE OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. SO IF THERE'S A COMMISSIONER INTERESTED IN THAT ROLE, TYPICALLY WE INCLUDE THIS, BUT THAT IS SIMPLY SORT OF AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT BY THE PLANNING COMMISSION JUST IN SUPPORT OF THAT PERSON SUBMITTING THEIR APPLICATION FOR CONSIDERATION TO THE FULL CITY COUNCIL. IDEALLY, I WOULD LIKE TO IDENTIFY A MASTER PLAN REVIEW COMMITTEE MEMBER, AN ORDINANCE REVISIONS COMMITTEE MEMBER, AND A TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION DESIGNEE, AND I HAVE MADE A NOTATION, BUT THERE'S NO AVAILABLE ZBAC -- THERE IS ONE VACANCY ON THE ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS IF ANYBODY IS INTERESTED IN THAT ROLE. I PUT TOGETHER A SUMMARY OF WHAT THOSE BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS ARE. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I NOTICED I MISSED WAS THE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE FOUR-YEAR REFERENCE -- FOR YOUR REFERENCE, THEY MEET ON THE THIRD WEDNESDAY OF EACH MONTH AT 7:00 P.M. SO FIGHT AMONGST YOURSELVES AND LET ME KNOW WHO WANTS TO BE ON WHAT.
03:34:40.308: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN.
03:34:44.545: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  I STRONGLY SUGGEST THAT SOMEONE ALSO TAKE MY ORC POSITION.
03:34:58.159: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT. IT LOOKS LIKE YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A COMMITTEE ASSIGNMENT. [ OFF MICROPHONE COMMENTS ]
03:35:08.302: >> Chair Milshteyn: THAT WAS MORE OF A JOKE.
03:35:21.682: >> Vice Chair Mills: AND IF SOMEONE WANTS TO TAKE MY PLACE ON MASTER PLANNING COMMISSION COMMITTEE, I'M HAPPY TO NOT SERVE IN THAT ROLE AND TH THE O.R.C. ROLE. SO IF SOMEBODY IS REALLY DISAPPOINTED THAT THEY CANNOT SERVE IN WHAT APPEARS TO BE --
03:35:41.569: >> Planning Manager:  THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE THE PROBLEM RIGHT NOW.
03:35:45.306: >> Vice Chair Mills: ALSO, DO YOU KNOW WHEN THAT IS GOING TO MEWETT?
03:35:48.309: >> Planning Manager:  WE DON'T. THAT WOULD BE ESTABLISHED WITH THAT GROUP. SO WITH THESE COMMITTEES, WE DON'T HAVE A SET NUMBER OF MEMBERS. TYPICALLY I DO LIKE TO KEEP IT UNDER A QUORUM OF THE PLANNING COMMISSION. SO MASTER PLAN REVIEW COMMITTEE COULD FUNCTION WITH FOUR MEMBERS, I I BELIEVE, IF -- IF COMMISSIONER MILLS WAS TO GRACIOUSLY BOW OUT. THAT WOULD LEAVE COMMISSIONER BRIGGS HAMMERSCHMIDT I'M HEARING INTEREST, SAUVE AND WOODS AS THE MASTER PLAN COMMITTEE. I THINK THAT WOULD BE AN ADEQUATELY SIZED COMMITTEE. SO CURRENTLY, WITH THE ORDINANCE REVISIONS COMMITTEE, AGAIN, WE HAVE FOUR. I WAS THINKING ABOUT POTENTIALLY INCREASING THAT TO FIVE, BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE WE SHOULD KEEP IT AT FOUR AND MAYBE FOCUS ON JUST FILLING COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN'S SEAT, IF ANYBODY IS INTERESTED IN THAT. IT'S LIKE THE BEST COMMITTEE.
03:36:50.738: >> Vice Chair Mills: IT'S MY FAVORITE PART OF PLANNING COMMISSION. [ LAUGHTER ]
03:36:56.344: >> Planning Manager:  ALL RIGHT. MAYBE -- MAYBE I WILL TALK TO COMMISSIONER ABRAMS WHEN SHE -- IF THAT'S SOMETHING SHE'S INTERESTED IN. SO FOR NOW, THOUGH, I WOULD BE PROPOSING TO REMOVE COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN FROM THAT. AND THEN COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL, ARE YOU STILL COMFORTABLE MAINTAINING THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION AND THE D. D.A. PARTNERSHIPS?
03:37:28.009: >> YES.
03:37:28.276: >> Planning Manager:  IS ANYBODY INTERESTED IN TRANSPORTATION?
03:37:36.617: >> IT SEEMS LIKE COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT MIGHT BE REALLY GOOD AT THAT, BASED ON SOME OF THE THINGS I HEARD HER SAY.
03:37:44.258: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: I -- I MEAN, YEAH. DO YOU DO IT FOR A YEAR?
03:37:50.231: >> Planning Manager:  WE CAN DO IT EVERY YEAR. WE TYPICALLY DO, BUT THE INTENTION IS -- MY INTENTION IS ALWAYS ONCE WE DESIGNATE IT, THEY WOULD STAND UNTIL THEY NEED TO FILL SOME ROLE. SO --
03:38:06.781: >> THAT COMMISSION REALLY NEEDS A REPRESENTATIVE.
03:38:29.070: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS?
03:38:30.071: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  I USED TO BE ON IT. IT'S A REALLY GREAT GROUP. VERY PROFESSIONAL. VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE. VERY COLLEGIAL.
03:38:38.512: >> Chair Milshteyn: I ACCIDENTALLY JOINED ONE OF THEIR MEETINGS, BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS THEIR MEETING. [ LAUGHTER ] I WALKED THROUGH THAT DOOR, AND I -- I'M LIKE, WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?
03:38:54.895: >> Planning Manager:  OKAY. ANYBODY INTERESTED IN ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS? DOES EVERYBODY KNOW WHAT THE ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS DOES?
03:39:11.612: >> COMMISSIONER ABRONS, HOW DOES THEY GET INTEGRATED IN?
03:39:20.921: >> Planning Manager:  I CAN ADOPT HER IN LATER. WE CAN REFLECT THESE CHANGES AND POSTPONE AND HOPE THAT WE HAVE A FULL COMMISSION AT A FUTURE MEETING. MY PREFERENCE, I GUESS WOULD BE TO PROBABLY GO AHEAD AND TAKE ACTIONS ON THINGS WE ARE COMFORTABLE WITH NOW, LIKE FOR THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION, I COULD GET COMMISSIONER WOODS SET UP WITH AN ORIENTATION WITH THE STAFF THERE. MAYBE AMEND AS NECESSARY.
03:39:45.446: >> Chair Milshteyn: CAN WE GO AHEAD AND PUT COMMISSIONER ABRONS ON O.R.C. AND IF THAT'S NOT WHAT SHE WANTS TO DO, WE CAN AMEND THAT LATER?
03:39:56.090: >> Planning Manager:  SURE. OKAY. SO I HAVE THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING COMMITTEE WOULD NOT CHANGE. MASTER PLAN REVIEW COMMITTEE WOULD ADD COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT, AND REMOVE COMMISSIONER MILLS. THE ORDINANCE REVISIONS COMMITTEE WOULD REMOVE COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN AND ADD COMMISSIONER ABRONS. NO CHANGES TO THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE, D.D.A. PARTNERSHIPS, ENVIRONMENTAL AND THE ZONING BOARD WOULD BE COMMISSIONER WOODS.
03:40:38.699: >> Vice Chair Mills: I'M WILLING TO CONSIDER Z.B.A., I REALLY LIKE ORDINANCES.
03:40:44.138: >> Chair Milshteyn: I DON'T THINK YOU ARE AVAILABLE. IT'S FOURTH WEDNESDAY OF THE MONTH. ISN'T O.R.C. --
03:40:49.710: >> Vice Chair Mills: THE FOURTH TUESDAY. BACK-TO-BACK. DOUBLEHEADER CHRISTMAS. POTENTIALLY, I COULD BE SWAYED.
03:40:58.052: >> Planning Manager:  WELL, AGAIN, THIS IS IT SOUNDS LIKE DUE TO NOT -- I
