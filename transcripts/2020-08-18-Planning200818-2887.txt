CAN I HAVE A MOTION TO APPROVE THE MINUTES OF JULY 21 AND AUGUST5, 2020 MEETINGS, MOVED BY COMMISSIONER ABRONS, SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL. ARE THERE ANY DISCUSSIONS IN THE MINUTES? ALL THOSE IN FAVOR OF THE MINUTE, PLEASE SAY AYE.
00:03:11.298: >> AYE.

00:03:41.528: >> THANK YOU, CHAIR MILLS, I HAVE REPORTS FROM OUR CITY COUNCIL MEETING LAST NIGHT. I WANT TO GIVE YOU AN UPDATE ON THREE TOPICS THAT GREEN BELT, REZONINGS, AND SITE PLANS, AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SO, WITH RESPECT TO THE GREEN BELT, CITY COUNCIL ACCEPTED TWO GRAN TO P CONSERVATIO EASEMENTS ON ONE PROPERTY ON NORTH FIELD TOWNSHIP AND ANOTHER PROPERTY ON SALEM TOWNSHIP ADDING TO THE GREENBELT AROUND THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. TURNING TO REZONINGS AND SITE PLANS, TWO REZONING COMMISSIONS AND COMPLEMENTARY SITE PLANS THAT WERE PASSED FROM THIS BODY WITH AECOMMENDATIOITH APOVAL TO CITY COUNC WER VOTED THROUGH AT CITY COUNCIL LAST NIGHT. THE FIRST WAS THE 3600 BLOCK OF APPROXIMATELY MOTH ROAD, WHICH IS THE RED ROOF IN, AND THE NOW CLOSED BIG BOY. THE REDEVELOPMENT OF THAT INTO TWO HOTEL BUILDINGS AND RESTAURANT. THE SECOND ISN JACKSON AVENUE, AGAIN, AN OLD DEMOLISHED HOTEL BEING REDEVELOPED INTO -- INTO TWO HOTELS. BOTH WENT THROUGH AT CITY COUNCIL LAST NIGHT. AND THEN TURNING OUR ATTENTION TO -- OH, I'LL JUST -- SORRY, IN TRANSITION, I GUESS, TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING, I'LL LETOU KNOW THAT APPROXIMATELY MOTH ROAD, THE COMMISSIONER DID OFFER A SET OF CONDITIONS TO THE REZONING SINCE IT WAS REVIEWED BY A PLANNING COMMISSION. I THINK YOUR CONVERSATION HELPS IN THAT DIRECTION. THE SET OF CONDITIONS IS IT WENT INTO THE USES AND PREVENTED SOME OF THE PERMITTED WAREHOUSING. THE SECOND CONDITION IS THE DEVELOPER IS PROVIDING A $75,000 VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTION TO THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING COMMISSION, WHICH IS A NICE TRANSITION TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING. LAST NIGHT, CITY COUNCIL PASSED THE RESOLUTION TO ADOPT THE WAIT LIST POLICY. SO, BEGINNING WITH PLANNING COMMISSION'S WORK TO INCORPORATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS INTO THE 11:40 BROADWAY PROJECT, THE 15 UNITS OF HOUSING THERE, AND THEN SUBSEQUENT EDITIONS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT WERE INCLUDED IN DDA PJECTS WHICH IS THE -- SORRY, THE D1 ZONING INCENTIVES CALLED FOR THE INCLUSION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING, WE'RE NOW GOING TO SEE COMING ON-LINE AID FORDABLE HOUSING UNITS BUILT INTO MARKET RATE DEVELOPMENTS AS A RESULT OF INCENTIVES WHICH I THINK THIS BODY HAS BEEN A PART OFN LOT OF DIFFERENT RATES. BECAE THOSE WILL BEOMING ON-LINE IN THE NEXT YEAR PLUS, FWHEED A POLICY TO COLLECT APPLICATIONS FOR THE WAIT LIST IN A CENTRALIZED WAY. AND THEN TO DISTRIBUTE THEM TO -- TOO, SO IT'S NOT EACH PROPERTY IS MANAGING A SEPARATE WAIT LIST, BUT KIT BE DONE IN A COORDINATED FASHION. SO, WE PASSED THAT -- THAT PROCESS IN POLICY LAST NIGHT. WHICH  THI ISOING T BE A HUGE -- A HE VALUE TO THOSE LOOKING FOR HOUSING. THEN THE SECOND UPDATE REALLY EXCITED TO SHARE THAT THE CITY DID VOTE TO PURCHASE LORI TERRACE. IT'S 136 UNITS THAT HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY SENIOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUTHOSE WERE LEGAL RESTRICTIONS, HAVEALLEN AWAY. IT'S JUST BEEN MAINTAINED BY A NONPROFIT ENTITY. AND IT'S BECOME TOO MUCH FOR NONPROFIT TO MANAGE TO THE CITY HAS TAKEN ON LIABILITY AND WE'LL IMPORT AFFDABLE HOUSG. IT WILL BE A NET AFFORDABLE HOUSING ULTIMATELY BECAUSE SOME OF THE UNITS IN THE BUILDING ARE MARKET RATE WILL OF COURSE ALLOW THOSE TENANTS TO STAY. IF THEY TRANSITION OUT FOR ANY REASON, WE'LL CONVERT THOSE UNITS TO AFFORDABLE
00:08:07.794: >> VERY GOOD, MR. LEONARD, ANYTHING TO ADD?
00:08:10.363: >> NO.
00:08:10.797: >> COMMISSION OFFICERS OR COMMITTEE LIAISONS HAVE ANYTHING TO REPORT? ALL RIGHT. THEN WE'RE UP TO ISLAND NO. 7 WHH IS AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PERSONS TO SPEAK UP TO THREE MINUTES ABOUT AN ISSUE THAT IS NOT LISTED AS A PUBLIC HEARING ON THIS AGENDA.

AGAIN, IF YOU'D LIKE TO DIGITAY RAISE YOUR HAND TO SPEAK ON A HEARING BEFORE TONIGHT'S MEETING, IT'S STAR 9. GOING ONCE. GOING TWE.
00:09:49.496: >> D'TAYANHING.
00:09:50.964: >> ALL RIT. MOVE TO ITEM NO. 8, THEN, WHICH IS PUBLIC HEARINGS FOR THE NEXT BUSINESS MEETING.
00:09:57.804: >> TWO NEW PUBLIC HEARINGS SCHEDULED FOR THE SEPTEMBER 1 REGULAR PLANNING COMMISSION. THE FIRST -- FIRST PUBLIC HEARING IS LOCKWOOD OF ANN ARBOR PLAN UNIT DEVELOPMENT ZONING AND SITE PLAN FOR CY COUNC APPROV. THIS IS A PROPOSED SENIO INDEPENDENT LIVING FACILITY WITH 154 UNITS, 154 VEHICLE PARKING SPACES ON A 7.98 PARCEL LOCATED ON 2.95 EAST ELLSWORTH ROAD. PLANNING UNIT IS REQUESTED TO ALLOW REDUCED PARKING AND DENSITY ON THE ZONING. PUBLIC BENITINCLUDE A NIMUM OF 30% OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING, 65 UNITS ON SITE. INCREASED OPEN AND LARGER SETBACKS AND DARK SKY COMPLIANT LIGHTING. THE SECOND PUBLIC HEARING IS SCHEDULED FOR PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE. THIS WILL BE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A BLOOD PLAIN MANAGEMENT. THIS I TO END NUMEROU SECTIO OF THE UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE TO AMEND REGULATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS FOR DEVELOPMENT IN AND AROUND.
00:11:08.041: >> VERY GOOD, WE ARE UP TO 9A, UNFINISHED BUSINESS. AND 9A IS A PETITION, AN AMENDMENT TO CHAPTER 55, UFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE STION 5.25, LIGHTING FOR CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL. SO, WE'LL HAVE THE STAFF PRESENTATION BY MR. LEONARD AND THEN THE PUBLIC HEARING.
00:11:46.680: >> INGE COLLUDED IN YOUR PACT ARE THE AMENDMENTS PROPOSED TO THE OUTDOOR LIGHTING CODE. I WOULD NOTE THAT THE PROPOSED ORDINANCE HAS BEEN AMENDED SLIGHTLY FROM THE VERSION THAT PREVIOUSLY APPEARED ON YOUR AGENDA WHEN IT WA POSTPONED ON JULY 21. SO, THE PROPOSE D JUST TO PROVIE A BIT OF BACKGROUND, I LIKE TO PROVIDE A BIT OF BACKGROUND ON CURRENT OUTDOOR REGULATIONS ARE, WHAT'S PROPOSED UNDER THIS PROPOSED ORDINANCE. AND THEN FRAME A FEW QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS WE HAVE. GENERALLY IT'S REGULATED THROUGH THE UNIFORM DEVELOPMENT CODE. WHEN THE SITE PLAN IS REQUIRED OR THE COST EXCEEDS 50% OF THE APPRAISED PLACEMENT COST OF THE ENTIRE BUILDING EXCLUSIVE OF FOUNDAON. SOT WOULD B WHEN YOU'RE RECONSTRUCTING SOMETHING, PERHAPS TO A SIGNIFICANT NATURE RATHER THAN AN ADDITIONAL OR MINOR CONSTRUCTION PROJECT. OR, WHEN A SHARED DRIVEWAY IS PROVIDED WITHIN AN EASEMENT. REQUIREMENTS SLL HAVE TO BE N ADEQUATELYHIELD SOD THAT NO LIGHT WILL GLARE ON TO ANY PUBLIC RIGHT OF WAY OR ANY PROPERTY PRINCIPALLY USED FOR RESIDENTIAL PURPOSES. AND NO LIGHTING CAN BE PROJECTED ON THE A PROPERTY USED FOR RESIDENTIAL PURPOSES MAY EXCEED FOOT ONE OF THE -- REGDLESS O WHAT HAPPENS RELATIV T THE OPERTY WHEREHE LIG IS LOCATED, THAT LIGHT CAN'T PROJECT ON TO ANY OTHER PROPERTY EXCEEDING THAT LIMIT. CURRENTLY WE HAVE PARKING LOT REGULATIONS AS WELL THAT REQUIRES PARKING LOTS THAT ARE LIT HALF HOUR BEFORE SUNSET AND HALF HOUR BEFORE SUNRISE. WETIPULATE A MINIMUM LIGHTING REQUIREMENTS. WE STIPULATE A MINIMUM FOOT CANDLE REQUIREMENT AND A MAXIMUM UNIFORMITY RATIO. THERE ARE A FEW EXCEPTIONS UNDER A CURRENT CODE WHICH IS FOR NONRESIDENTIAL LIGHTING LEVELS. THE FOOT-CANDLES CAN BE REDUCED TO FOUR FOOT-NDLES AFTER 2: A.M. OR AFTER BUSESS CLOSES. AND WE PROVIDE THAT NONRESIDENTIAL USE IN RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS, THIS MIGHT BE SCHOOLS OR CHURCHES OR OTHER TYPES OF USES, MAY REDUCE LEVELS OF 50% AFTER MIDNIGHT, ALSO SUBJECT TO A MAXIMUM UNIFORMITY RATIO. THAT IS OLSERSSLE WHEN APPROV AS PART OF A SITE PLAN. THE ORDINANCE BEFORE YOU TONIGHT RECONFIGURES HOW WE REGULATE LIGHTING IN A MUCH MORE DETAILED WAY. IT MODERNIZES OUR REGULATIONS TO A GREAT EXTENT. SO, FIRST OFF, THE PROPOSED ORDINANCE ADDS AN IENSE SEION. THE INTENSE IT MINIMIZES LIGHTING SUCH AS GLARE AND SKY GLOW. IT FOSTERS A SAFER ENVIRONMENT. IT WILL BE A NEW SECTION TO OUR LIGHTING ORDINANCE. APPLICABILITY, IT WOULD APPLY TO ALL LIGHTING, BUT THIS ORDINANCE ISOING TO ALY TO ALL LIGHTINGHAT APPLIES TO EXTERIOR ILLUMINATION AFTER SUNSET AND BEFORE SUNRISE. SO IT WILL BROADLY APPLY TO ALL LIGHTING IN THE CITY, PERIOD. IT DOES PROPOSE SOME EXCEPTIONS. TEMPORARY LIGHT INSTALLATIONS ON DATES.OPERTY FOR 90 CONCUTIVE SO IT ACCOUNTS FOR SEASONAL DECORATIONS OR TEMPORARY ART INSTALLATIONS OR SPECIAL EVENTS. IT EXEMPTS ANY LIGHTING FOR FLAGS. AND IT EXEMPTS ANY LUMINARY OR AS WE DEFINE IT, ALL OF THE ASPECTS OF LIFE THAT THEY PULL TO CREATE THE LIT. DISTRICT TOONTRIBUTE T THE HISTORIC CHARACTER OF A LISTED PROPERTY. ONE OF THE THINGS THIS ADDS IS A COLOR SPECTRUM MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS. FOR ALL LUMINARY, AIN, THAT'S THE TERM FOR A LIGHTIN FIXTE, ESSENTIALLY, WILL HAVE A MINIMUM COLORING INDEX OF 70 AND ALL SIMILARLY IN THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCE, ALL LUMINARIES SHOULD HAVE A CORRELATED COLOR TEMPERATURE NOT GREATER THAN 3,000K. THESE ARE REFERENCES THAT MEASURE AND RATE A LIGHT'S FAHFULNESS TO THE THERMAL PURE - THERMAL COLOR SPECTRUM AND WHERE A LIGHT'S PERCEIVED LIGHT FALLS ON THAT COLOR SPECTRUM. THAT IS, IT'S MORE WARM OR COOL, PERHAPS, A VERY OVERSIMPLIFIED WAY OF DESCRIBING IT. IT WOULD NOT APPLY TO ONE AND TWO FAMILY PROPERTIES, SPECIFICALLYHEOLOR SPECTRUM MANAGEMENT. AND I WLD POINT OUT JUST IN MY -- IN MY INVESTIGATION, OFTEN THE COLORING INDEX IS SPECIFICALLY NOT PROVIDED ON WIDELY AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC. I ANTICIPATE PERHAPS WITH TIME THAT MAYBE IT WILL EVOLVE. BUT I JUST RAISE IT AS A DIFFICULFOR PROPERTY OWNERS TH ENSURE COMPLIANCE IN THAT WAY AND FOR US TO ENFORCE IT. WE HAVE A LOT FOR LUMINARY DESIGN. I'M SORRY THEY'RE SLOW. I'LL TOUCH ON IT. WE MAIAINED THE .1 FOOT CANDLE PROPERTY TO ANY PROPERTY IN ANY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT BUT WE ADD YOU CAN'T TRESPASS BEYOND THAT LEVEL IN A PUBLIC LAND DISTRICT OR IN A PUBLIC RIGHT OF WAY. WE PROVIDE A HIGHER LEVEL IN THE D1 AND D2 AND DOWNTOWN INTERFACE DISTRICTS. AND OTHER DISTRICTS, WE PROVIDE A LIMIT OF UP TO TWO-OT-CANDLES. WE MAINTAI THE REQUIREMENTS THAT NO LUMINARY CAN CAUSE GLARE. AND WE MANDATE, DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF SERVICE THAT'S BEING ILLUMINATED, EITHER A FULLY SHIELDED OR PARTIALLY SHIELDED FIXTURE, THAT IS THE FIXTURE DESIGNED IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE LIGHT IS BEING PJECTED O TO E DESIRED SURFACE AND THE MAXIMUM -- TO THE MAXIMUM EFFECT WITHOUT MUCH VISUAL -- BEING ABLE TO SEE THE ACTUAL LIGHT SOURCE DIRECTLY. SO YOU SEE THE EFFECT OF THAT LIGHT BUT NOT SEE THE LIGHT SOURCE. NOW WE ESTABLISH MAXIMUM FACADE ILLUMITION LEVELS. WE ARE PROPOSING WE WOULD REQUIRE WHEN THAT HAPPENS THOSE LIGHTS GET DIRECTED DOWNWARD, RATHER THAN UPWARD. DECORATIVE LIGHTING IS PROHIBITED BETWEEN MIDNIGHT AND 6:00 A.M. UNLESS THE BUSINESS IS OPEN -- BUSINESS HOURS EXTEND BEYOND THAT. MOTION ACTIVATION OF ANY LIGHTS CANNOT BE ACTIVATED BEYOND THE PROPERTY BOUNRY. UNDER CANOPY LIGHTING WILL BE FULLY SHIELDED AND SETTING ON LIMITS ON THE MAXIMUM ILLUMINATION UNDER A CANOPY AS OPPOSED TO MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS UNDER A PARKING LOT, FOR EXAMPLE. WHILE OUR POLE LIGHTS HAVE TO BE NO HIGHER THAN 45 DEGREES BEYOND HOZONTAL, Y CAN'T HAVE DYNAMICALLY CHANGING LIGHTS OR STROBE FLASHING, BLINKING, OR MOVING LIGHTS. I WOULD NOTE, AND I JUST WANT TO RAISE THIS, BY EXEMPTING TEMPORARY LIGHTS, THEY WOULD NOT BE SUBJECT TO THIS RESTRICTION. SO YOU CAN HAVE SEASONAL OR TEMPORARY LIGHTING UP TO 90 DAYS THAT MIGHT BE FLASHING OR STROBING OR CHANGING. I KNOW IN THE PAST THERE'S BEEN A CONCERN FROM PUBLIC SAFETY PERSPECTIVE, DISTRACTIONS THAT MIGHT BE SEEN FROM A PUBLIC RIGHT OF WAY. BUT I WANT TO RAISE TT AS A QUESTION AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED BACK -- THAT PROVISION WOULD NOT APPLY FROM ANYTHING THAT'S EXEMPT FROM THE ORDINANCE. PARKING LOTS SHALL NOT EXCEED SIX FOOT-CANDLES AND EXTINGUISHED AFTERHOURS. THAT'S DEPARTURE WE SET A MINIMUM AMOUNT OF LIGHTING AND WE REQUIRE THEY BE LIT THROUGH THE NIGHT. AND ANY SAFETY LIGHTING CANNOT EXCEED TWO FULL CANDLES. AS NONCONFORMING LUMINARIES MAY BE USED OR MAINTAINED OR PREPARED IN A TIME NOT PERFORMING. ENACTING THIS ORDINANCE IS GOING TO RENDER A LOT OF LIGHTS IN THE CITY NOT AT THAT TIME, IF ENTED. AND WH THAT MEANS IS JUST LIKE ANY ZONING REGULATION, THEY'RE GOING TO INHERENT LIGHTS TO CONTINUE TO USE AND MAINTAIN THE LIGHTS CONSISTENT WITH HOW THEY'RE PREVIOUSLY COMPLIANCE WITH YOURS. THAT SHALL HAVE FULL COMPLIAE WHEN EVER STAFF AND CITY COUNCIL IS CONSIDERING THE SITE PLAN, THEY'RE MEASURING IT IN ALL APPLICABLE CODES IN REGULATION OF THAT TIME. BE ONE OF THE SPECIFIC THINGS THAT HAS EVOLVED FROM THE PREVIOUS -- FROM THE PREVIOUS VERSION IS THAT STAFF IS PROPOSING TO REMOVE THE ELECTRICAL PERMITS ANY SORT OF TRIGGER OR REQUIRING A REPLACEMENT. THE STATUS OF THE LIGHT THAT IS IN PLACE AND IN SERVICE NOW IN COMPLIANCE OF THE ORDINANCE. AN ELECTRICAL EVENT IS NOT DETERMINING WHETHER IT'S NOONFORMING OR NOT ANYMORE. RENDERING A LIGHT EITHER CONFORMING OR NONCONFORMING. AN ELECTRICAL WORK FOR THAT LIGHT IS FOR THAT WORK OR ANY OTHER ELECTRICAL WORK SHOULDN'T BE THE TRIGGER AND DETERMINANT AS TO WHETHER OR NOT A LIGHT NEEDS TO BE BROUGHT INTO COMPL COLIANCE. SO SIMPLY, ANY NEW LIGHT HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THE ORDINANCE. EXISTING NONCONFORMING LIGHT WOULD NEED TO BE MAINTAINED AND REPAIRED IN THE CURRENT FORM BY RATE OF UNDER STATE-ENABLING LEGISLATION AND CASE LAW ABOUT NONCONFORMING USES. AND ANY TIME A SITE PLAN IS APPLIED, FULL CONFORMANCE HAS TO BE AROUND THE SITE. ANYTHING YOU WANT TO CONSIDER THIS, RESEARCH HAS FULLY EVOLVED AND SHOWN THE ADVERSE IMPACTS SINCE OUR INITIAL DRAFTING OF OUR OUOOR LIGHTING CODE. THERE ARE - THERE'S MUCH MORE -- THERE'S A GREATER BODY OF RESEARCH ABOUT THE ADVERSE IMPACTS OF SKY GLOW, ABOUT SORT OF HUMAN SLEEP CYCLES AND THE LIGHT. SO I THINK IT'S WELL WARRANTED FOR THE CITY TO BE LOOKING AT THIS. THIS ORDINANCE DEFINITEL EVOLVES OM PBABLY A -- N NECESSARILY A -- A RESEARCH BASED PERCEPTION, BUT I THINK A COMMONLY HELD PERCEPTION THAT MORE LIGHTING EQUALS SAFETY. RESEARCH DEMONSTRATES THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE CASE. BUT THAT'S STILL SORT OF A PROBABLY MY IN THE COMMUNY. I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE A POINT THAT'S GOING TO COME UP. I SPENT A LITTLE TIME ON NONCONFORMING STATUS BY ENACTING THE REGULATIONS LIGHTING LIKE ANY OTHER CHANGE IS GOING TO RESULT IN NONCONFORMITIES AND THERE ARE APPROPRIATE RIGHTS FOR NONCONFORMING USES TO BE ABLE TO COINUE UND LAW. INCREMENTALLY, IT COULD HAVE IMPACT TO ADDING COST THE TO THE DEVELOPMENT AND RESULT IN THE AFFORDABILITY OF THESE PROJECTS. I WANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT I THINK IN THE CONTEXT OF A LARGE SITE, IT IS VERY INCREMENTAL. BUT FOR THIS CIRCUMSTANCE, FOR EXAMPLE, THE ADMINISTRATIVE SITE PLAN, IT WOULD BE A RATIVY MODEST IMPROVEME IS GOING T REQUE POTENTIALLY REPLACEMENT OF FIXTURES IF THEY ARE NOT COMPLIANT WITH THIS ORDINANCE. SO THE CITY SHOULD GO IN EYES OPEN THIS IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF HERMPLICATIONS ON  COU HAVE DEVEPMENT OVERL. MANY OF THESE ASPECTS ARE NIGHTTIME SPECIFIC. THE CITY DOESN'T HAVE ZONING FOR ENFORCEMENT DURING THAT TIME. THE SAME THING HOLDS THROUGH FOR TODAY AND WE DO HAVE THE REQUIREMENTS. SO, AS WE SORT OF ESTABLISHED ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENT AND MORE REGULATIS, I JUST THK IT FAIR TO HIGHLIGHT THAT THESE REGULATIONS AREN'T GOING TO INHIBIT BEING ON THE STREET AT NIGHT MAKING SURE EVERYBODY IS IN FULL COMPLIANCE. WE APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT COMMISSIONS, AND ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION REPSENTATIVES HAVE PUT INTO THIS. IS IT MODERNIZES US AND MOVES THE CITY IN A POSITIVE DIRECTION. AND I'LL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE.
00:26:16.482: >> THANK YOU, MR. LEONARD. NOW WE'LL OPEN THE PUBLIC HEARING. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PERSONS TO SPEAK FOR UP TO THREE MINUTES ABOUT THE PROPOSED UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE OR OUTDOOR LIGHTING AMENDMENTS. PUBLIC COMMENT MAY BE MADE BY CALLING 1-877-3-5247 A ENTENG MEENG ID985-77-78-7699. CITY STAFF SELECTED CALLERS WHO RAISED THEIR HAND. YOU CAN RAISE YOUR HAND BY PRESSING STAR 9. MR. LEONARD SAID IT'S YOUR TURN NUMBER.ITS OF YOU PHONE HE LAST WHEN YOU SPEAK,LEASE DO MOVE TO A QUIET AREA AND MUTE ANY TV OR BACKGROUND NOISES. AND PLEASE ALSO STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS FOR THE RECORD.
00:27:20.946: >> SALLY, YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION. BUT YOU'RE MUTED CURRENTLY, IF YOU CAN UNMUTE YOUR PHONE. AND I WILL KEEP SALLY ON AFTER AS WELL GIVEN HER INVOLVEMENT IF THAT'S OKAY WITH THE COMMISSION TO ADDRESS ANY QUESTIONS ONCE YOU GET TO THE DELIBERATION?
00:27:39.365: >> SOUNDGREAT.
00:27:55.547: >> I THINK THE MUTING HAPPENS ON YOUR END, MAYBE?
00:27:59.151: >> NO, I AM CHECKING.
00:28:06.592: >> MAYBE SHE'S TRYING BACK.
00:28:12.298: >> LET'S TRY SO LET ME TRY TO BRING IN ANOTHER CALLER. THE CALLER PHONE NUMBER 989, YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
00:28:35.955: >> HI, MY NAME IS HEATHER GOODE, MY ADDRESS IS 2468 FIRMWOOD 48104. IN ANN ARBOR, MICHIGAN, I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE MICHIGAN AUDUBON, WHICH IS THE STATE'S OLDEST CONSERVATION ORGANIZATION. AND ALTHOUGH BASED IN THE LANSING AREA FOR WORK, MY HOME IS IN ANN ARBOR. CALLING IN TODAY TO SAVE THE COMMSIONERS FOR TIR WORK ON THISND ON THEIR FOLLOW-THROUGH ON WHAT I CONSIDER TO BE A MODEL LIGHTING ORDINANCE AND MOVING IN THE DIRECTION OF A GREATER, MORE SUSTAINABILITY-MINDED MODEL. AND, I WANTED TO ECHO THE BENEFITS OF THIS FOR BIRDS AND THE ENVIRONMENT. AND AS WE KNOW, WHAT'S GOOD FOR BIRDS AND POINATOR IS GOOD FOR HUMANS AND THE COMMUNITY. AGAIN, ON BEHALF OF MICHIGAN AUDUBON AND BIRD CONSERVATION EFFORTS, I WANT TO EXPRESS OUR SUPPORT AND ENCOURAGEMENT FOR THE APPROVAL OF THIS ORDINANCE. AND IT REFLECTS THE COMMITMENT TO SUSTAINABILITY. AND TO BIRD CONSERVAON. SO THANKOU VERY MUCH
00:30:17.723: >> CALLER, PHONE NUMBER 654, IF YOU CAN UNMUTE YOURSELF AND YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
00:30:28.267: >> THIS IS JOHN MURSKY, DO YOU HEAR ME?
00:30:31.904: >> YEAH, JOHN?
00:30:33.605: >> GOOEVENG. I'M AN A ARBOR RESIDE. I LIVE AT 505BURSTON PLACE, A CHAIR COMMISSION AND I'M A MEMBER OF THE TEAM THAT DEVELOPED THE LIGHTING ORDINANCE. I HAVE THREE POINTS I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS. FIRST OF ALL, I'D LIKE TO URGE THE COMMISSION TO UNANIMOUSLY VOTE TO RECOMMEND THE LIGHTING ORDINANCE BE APPROVED BY CITY COUNCIL. IT WOULD HELP ACHIEVE THE DESIRED OBJECTIVES OUTLINED BY MR. LEONARD. OH SECONDLY, THE PLANNING COMMISSION, THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT, AND MORE BROADLY, OTHER BOARDS AND COMMISSION, CITY ADMINISTRATION, AND CITY COUNCIL IN MY VIEW NEEDS TO RECONSIDER HOW ORDINANCES ARE IN THE UDC IF ANN ARBOR IS TO HAVE THE GOALS SUCH AS 2030 AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY TARGETS. I REALIZE THE CONCERNS AS OUTLIN BY MR. LEORD ABOUT TAKINGS AND RIGHT OF PRERTY OWN OWNERS. HOWEVER, NO OR A LONG DRAWNOUT AMORTIZATION PROCESS OR CLAUSE SIMPLY WON'T GET US TO WHERE WE NEED TO BE GIVEN THE FACT THAT NEW OR REDELOENT ONLY PACTS A SMA PERCENTAGE OF OUR BUILT ENVIRONMENT. I THINK WE NEED A NEW PARADIGM. THIRDLY, I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT COLLECTIVELY THAT WE -- I INGE COLLUDE MYSELF IN WE -- WE ARE TOO SLOW IN DEVELOPING, APPROVING, AND IMPLEMENTING NEW ORDINANC AND NEW UDC UPDATES. I'VE BEEN WORKING ON SEVERAL ORDINANCE CHANGES AND CHANGES TO THE UDC. AND ALL OF THOSE HAVE BEEN IN PROCESS FOR OVER TWO YEARS. HIGH-PERFORMANCE ORGANIZATIONS RECOGNIZE THAT SHORT LEAD TIMES ADDITION TO HH QUALITY OUTCOMES ARE A MUST. IF -- IF WE AREN'T FAST AND EVEN IF WE'RE WORKING ON THE RIGHT THINGS, BUT IF WE AREN'T FAST, AND EVEN IF WE'RE WORKING ON THE RIGHT THINGS, WE WILL FALL BEHIND OTHER HIGH PERFORMERS. AT ALSO MEA WE'VE BECOME A HIGHER COST TO DEAL WITH. THIS APPLIES EQUALLY TO MUNICIPALITIES, NOT JUST TO BUSINESSES INTRODUCING NEW PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, WE, AND AGAIN, I'M LOOKING AT MYSELF IN THE MIRROR, WE HAVE TO TACKLE THIS PROBLEM. SO WE NEED TO GET FASTER AND W NEED T GETTING FASTER FAST. THANK YOVERY MUCH. I APPRECIATE ALL OF THE WORK THAT EVERYBODY HAS PUT INTO THIS ORDINANCE, INCLUDING THE UP COMMISSION ITSELF.
00:33:58.010: >> HI, I'M SALLY. REPRESENTING THE LOCAL ADVOCACY GROUP MICHIGAN DARK SKIES. AND ALSO THE JOINT WORKING GROUP THAT DRAFTED THE ORDINANCE. AND I'D ONLY LIKE TO REMIND THE FROM T COMMUNITY WHO PVIDED OPLE MMENT ON JULY 21 ON SUPPORT OF THE PROPOSED LIGHTING ORDINANCE, INCLUDING THE MEMBERS WHO REPRESENT THE BIRD CENTER OF WASHINAU COUNTY AND THE AUDUBON. I STRONGLY SUPPORT ALL OF THE COMMENTS MADE BY THE PREVIOUS TWO COMMENTERS. AND I WANT TO SPORT JOHN MURSKY'S STATEMENTS ABOUT THE NEED OF AMORTIZATION OF FIXTURES OF THIS ORDINANCE BE PASSED BY THE CITY COUNCIL. THANK YOU, ONCE AGAIN, OUR GRATITUDE TO ALL OF YOU. THANK YOU.
00:34:50.696: >> THANK YOU. DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THERE'S ANYBODY ELSE ON, ALL RIGHT? CAN  I WILL READ THE MOTION. THE MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL APPROVE THE AMENDMENTS TO CHAPTER 25 UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE REPLACING SECTION 5.25, OUTDOOR LIGHTING AND ADDING CTION 5.33.6NONCONFORMING LIGHTING INSTALLATIONS. AND ADDING 13 DEFINITIONS TO 5.37.2 SPECIFIC TERMS IN ORDER TO MORE EFFECTIVELY REGULATE OUTDOOR LIGHTING THROUGHOUT THE CITY. CAN I HAVE A COMMISSIONER MOVE THAT -- MOVED BY COMMISSIONER WOODS, SECONDE BY COMMISSIONE MILLSHTEYN. THE PROPOSED MOTION?
00:35:52.958: >> IF YOU CAN CLARIFY ONE THING. LET'S SAY I'M THINKING OF A BANK DOWNTOWN, KEY BANK, ONHE CORNER O MAI AND RON. IT'S HIS TORE iHAS BEAUTIFUL UPLIGHTING UP AT THE TOP. IS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS INDIVIDUAL BULBS GO OUT, THEY DON'T HAVE TO CHANGE THEIR WHOLE SYSTEM. BUT DO THEY HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THE LIGHT USE IN TERMS OF HOURS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. OR DOES THAT ONLY APPLY TO NE-- NEWROJECTS?
00:36:24.856: >> THNICALLY IT APPLIES TO NEW PROJECTS AND ANY REPLACED LIGHTING FIXTURES. WE, BY LAW, HAVE GRANTED CERTAIN RIGHTS TO OPERATE OR BUY MINIMAL REGULATIONS. SO, IT'S MUCH EASIER F YOU TO COMP, TH NATE OFEING A LIGHT FIXTURE IS NO DIFFERENT THAN IN THE EYES OF SORT OF CASE LAW AND PLANNING AND ZONING LAW CAN SET BACK AND EXIST UNLESS SOME SEVERE CIRCUMSTANCE CAN BE BROUGHT UP.
00:37:05.163: >> SO, IN OTHER WORDS, IF IAVE A NEIGOR THAT S ARAZY BRIGHTIGHT SHINING INTO THE WIN TOES, I CAN'T TELL THEM TO DO ANYTHING DIFFERENTLY UNTIL THEY'RE READY TO CHANGE OUT THE WHOLE THING.
00:37:19.044: >> CURRENTLY, THE ONLY RESTRICTION WE HAVE IS THEY SHOULDN'T BE PROVIDING GLARE INTO YOUR WINDOWS. BUT THAT IS -- THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK GENERALLY PEOPLE OPPOSED TO SOMETHING MEASURABLE, PERHAPS.
00:37:34.159: >> OKAY.
00:37:34.426: >> ALL RIGHTY. OKAY. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS? GO AHEAD, ERICA.
00:38:03.855: >> ANOTHER THING ON THE AMORTIZATION PIECE OF THINGS, THERE WAS AN ATTEMPT MADE PARTICULARLY ONEROUS IN TERMS OF PROVISIONS THAT WEAD EARLIE IN TERMS OF HOW THAT MIGHT PLAY OUT. WERE THERE ANY OTHER SORT OF OPTIONS THAT WERE POTENTIALLY CONSIDERED AS ALTERNATIVES?
00:38:34.786: >> RRY. WE SPE A FAIR AMOUNT OF TIME WITH ORIGINAL LANGUAGE AND OTHER OPTIONS. AND IT ULTIMATELY ELECTRICAL PERMITS IN -- IN STATS VIEW ARE NOT A GOOD -- IN STAFF'S VIEW, THEY'RE NOT A GOOD -- THEY'RE NOT A GOOD DETERMINANT OF WHEN SOMETHING SHOULD REQUIRE - SHOU BE REQUIREDO MAKE COMPLIANT. FOR EXAMPLE, AS THE LANGUAGE WAS ORIGINALLY WRITTEN, IT SAID A NONCONFORMING LUMINARY CAN BE MAINTAINED AND REPAIRED IN THIS CURRENT STATE. HOWEVER, IT SAID, IF AN ELECTRICAL PERMIT FOR ANY EXTERIOR WORK IS FILED, THEN WE HAVE TO REPLACE . WELL, THOSE TWO COULD BE IN CONFLICT WITH EACH OTHER. YOU COULD HAVE TO GET AN ELECTRICAL PERMIT TO REPAIR AN EXISTING FIXTURE. AND, SO, THAT -- THE FACT THAT YOU NEED TO DO AN ELECTRICAL PERMIT ONCE THE WORK GETTINGS TO A CERTAIN SCALE IS NOT AN APPROPRIATE WAY TO DECIDE WHETHER THAT LIGHT WAS COMPLNT UNR RURRENT REGATIONS AND NO LONGER IT IS -- IT IS ELECTRICAL PERMIT IS INTENDED TO MAKE SURE THAT ANY WORK THAT IS CONDUCTED IS DONE IN A SAFE MANNER. AND, SO, IT'S REALLY ON THE ONUS OF THE UDC TO SAY, AT THIS POINT IN TIME, THESE ARE THE FIXTURES THAT ARE PERMITTED. AND IF THIS WERE ENACTED, THAT'S GOING TO RENDER ALL OF THOSE NONCONFORMING, BUT, AGAIN, JUST LIKE ANY NONCONFORMING, WE DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO SAY, AND, AND, ONE YEAR, ALL OF YOU HAVE TO REPLACE YOUR LIGHTS IN ORDER TO BE COMPLIANT. THAT'S JUST NOT THE WAY NONCONFORMITIES WORK. SO, IN SHORT, WE DID LOOK AT IT. WE TED TO FIGE OUT THE RIGHT TRIGGERS. AND WE CONCLUDED THAT THE ELECTRICAL PERMIT IS NOT AN APPROPRIATE TRIGGER TO MAKE THAT DECISION. THE DECISION IS BASED ON THE LIGHT ITSELF AND THE VALUATION
00:40:36.708: >> IN TERMS OF COLLABORATN, RIGHT NOW THEY'RE REQUIRING PARKING LOTS TO BE LIT ALL NIGHT LONG. IT -- ONCE THIS GETS PAST FOR -- YOU KNOW, FOR THOSE REGULATIONS ARE SHIFTING, IT -- THIS DOES NOT REQUIRE BUSINESSES THAT HAVE AN EXISTING LIGHTING SETP TO SHIFT THOS HOURS OF OPERATN, CORRT? .
00:41:18.783: >> THEY COULD SHIFT THE HOURS OF OPERATIONS, BUT BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE ORDNANCE, THEY'RE REQUIRED TO HAVE THE OPTIONS TO DO SO.
00:41:26.224: >> THAT'S ONE PIECE THAT I -- I ST WONDER. TH'S ONE PIECE THAT I WONDER COULD MAKE A LOT OF IMPACT ACROSS THE COMMUNITY IN TERMS OF JUST -- SORRY IF I -- LET ME KNOW IF YOU CAN'T HEAR ME. REQUIRING THAT PIECE TO BE PUT INTO PLACE, THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY PARTICULARLY ONEROUS. THINK MOSTYSMS SULD B SET UPN TIMERS, EVEN IF THERE'S SOME SORT OF TIMING THAT THE TIMING OR PHASING PIECE. IS THERE ANY OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD THAT IN?
00:42:06.030: >> I DON'T THINK HOW OWN RULES IT IS HAS ANY BEARING ON THAT SO, IN SHORT, I DON THINK THAT WE CAN PARSE THE SORT OF OPERATIONAL ASPECTS OF THIS SEPARATE FROM THE PHYSICAL ASPECTS. WE -- SOMETHING AS PERMISSIBLE NOW, WE -- WE CAN'T SORT OF RETROACTIVELY MAKE IT NONPERMISSIBLE. NOW. I MEAN, I WOULD SAY AS IMPERFECT AND AS LONG-TERM AS THIS REGULATION IS, AS FRANKLY AS ANY UDC ZONING REGULATION. IT -- IT WOULD -- I WOULD SAY IT WOULD BE A STEP IN THE DIRECTION BECAUSE WE ALLOW IT, AT LEAST. BECAUSE RIGHT NOW, IF THAT PARKING LOT SHUTS OFF, IT'S TECHNICALLY IN VIOLATION OF THE CODE. SO, YOU OW, - WE CAN LOOK AT COMMUNITY EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES, BUT THE STORY OF IT IS, I DON'T THINK THAT JUST BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING THAT MIGHT NOT REQUIRE PHYSICAL EXPENDITURE THAT THAT'S LOOKED AT ANY DIFFERENTLY IN ITS STATUS.
00:43:18.970: >> THEN I'M SORRYIDN'T THINK ABOUT THIS EARLIER. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I DON'T THINK WE TALKED ABOUT AS A COMMITTEE. BUT, JUST THOUGHT OF THIS. IN TERMS OF THE TEMPORARY INSTALLATIONS, WOULD SOMETHING BE CONSIDERED LIKE -- LET'S SAY AT A NEW BUSINESS OPERATION -- YOU KNOW, THERE WAS A N BUSINESSNDHEY HAD A TEMPORARY LIGHT THAT WAS, YOU KNOW, ONE OF THOSE SPOTLIGHTS IS CIRCLING AND GOING UP, DIRECTED UP AT THE SKY. WOULD THAT -- WOULD THAT -- THAT WOULD BE CLASSIFIED UNDER POTENTIALLY A TEMPORARY LIGHT INSTALLATION? RIGHT?
00:44:02.080: >> A TEMPORARY LIGHT INSTALLATION FOR A TOTAL OF 90 DAYS. -- I THINK THAT IT COULD MEET THAT DEFINITION. I THINK THAT IT COULD -- DON'T SEE -- IT AOOD QUESTION. I'M TRYING TO RECONCILE IT WITH SIGNAGE REGULATIONS TO SEE IF THAT WOULD BE INTERPRETED AS SIGNAGE. BUT I THINK A CASE COULD BE MADE THAT IT FALLS UNDER HIS CATEGORY. THAT COULD UP PARTICULARLY BE PERMISSIBLE UP TO A 90-DAY PERIOD.
00:44:45.757: >> I THINK IT'S A SITE -- IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU CAN THINK OF THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO ADDRESS THAT MORE. IT'S MORE OF A SIGNAGE ISSUE, I THINK, TRYING TO ATTRACT
00:45:05.777: >> YEAH, MY INITIALSS? THOUGHT.
00:45:09.280: >> BUT.
00:45:10.048: >> MY INITIAL THOUGHT WOULD BE.
00:45:12.650: >> MY INITIAL THOUGHT WOULD BE -- YOU COULD IDENTIFY IT AS EXEMPT, BUT STILL SPECIFICALLY MAKE IT -- WOULD STILL HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THE OTHER PROVISIONS, BUT THEN, YOU'VE GOT SEASAL LIGHTINS GOING TO  ANY HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THOSE PROVISIONS. OR, YOU COULD -- YOU COULD RESTRICT THE EXEMPTION TO RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS. YOU COULD POTENTIALLY SAY THAT TEMPORARY LIGHT INSTALLATIONS MEANING THAT DEFINITION WOULD ONLY BE PERMISSIBLE SORT OF IN PLACES WHERE YOU'RE NOT USED FOR MORE COMMERCIAL PURPOSES. BUT I THINK THE INTENTION IS FOR THIS LANGUAGE TO PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PUBLIC USES.
00:46:09.173: >> SO, I'M JUST GOING TO LET SARAH THING ON THIS FOR AECOND OR SOMEBODY ELSE.
00:46:15.246: >> COMMISSIONER GABE RANDALL, SINCE I HAVE AN IDEA ON THIS ISSUE. I WONDER TO FLOAT BY MR. LEONARD, IF YOU COULD EFFECTIVELY KEEP THE RESTRICTION FOR TEMPORARY ORDINANCE -- FOR TEMPORARY LIGHTS EXCEPT THEY MUST COMPLY WITH THAT ONE THAT'S EFFECTIVELY ABOUT NO STROBE FLASHING SEARCHING SEARCHLIGHTS. SO TPORARY LIGHTSRE EXEMPT FROM THIS -- FM EVERYTHING IN THE ORDINANCE EXCEPT THAT PARTICULAR PROVISION? IS THAT POSSIBLE? IT COULD. IF YOU WANTED TO DO HOLIDAY LIGHTS. THEY MIGHT BE FLASHING OR BLINKING.
00:46:57.555: >> Y HIGHLIGHTED THAT WOULD BE A SAFETY ISSUE. THAT'S A LOOPHOLE.
00:47:07.765: >> ABSOLUTELY. THAT'S WHAT I WAS SUGGESTING. THE INSTALLATIONS ARE EXEMPT FROM THIS ORDINANCE. HOWEVER, THEY MUST COMPLY WITH
00:47:17.208: >> I THINKHAT'S THE ONLYNE THAT'S IMPORTANTO MEND STANDS O FOR THE TEMPORARY INSTALLATIONS. I LIKE WHAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT POTENTIALLY DIFFERENTIATING BETWEEN THEM. SOME OF THE THINGS, HOLIDAY LIGHTING, BUT THERE ARE OTHER CLASSES OF THINGS THAT WOULD HAPPEN IN NONRESIDTIAL STRICTS, LIKEEMPORARY ART DISPLAYS. AND, SO, TO MAKE ALL OF THOSE THINGS HAVE TO MEET EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE CODE SEEMS ONEROUS TO ME. I WON'T -- I GUESS I COULD MAKE A MOTION TOMENDHE ORDINANCE SPECIFICALO HAVE THOSE TEMPORARY LIGHT DILAYS COMPLY WITH THE ONE NUMBER THAT I CAN DIG OUT UNLESS YOU HAVE IT HANDY, ABOUT NOT BEING FLASHING, STROBING. I WOULD MOVE THAT IF ANYONE WANTS TO SECOND THAT. SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER ACRMAN. DISCSION ON TH?
00:48:36.554: >> I DON'T HAVE FLASHING CHRISTMAS LIGHTS. BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT FLASHING CHRISTMAS LIGHTS ARE DIFFERENT THAN A STROBE LIGHT POINTING STRAIGHT UP INTO THE SKY FOR ME. ERE'S PLENTY OF PEOE WITH FLASHING CHRISTMAS LIGHTS AROUND. IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IN THE SCHEME OF THINGS THOSE FEEL DIFFERENTLY TO ME. I KNOW THE INTENT WAS YOU'RE DRIVING DOWN A BIG BUSY ROAD AND THERE'S A SIGN OUT FRONT THAT'S BLINKING AND BEATING AT YOU. THAT'S DIFFERENT TO ME THAN SOMEBODY'S CHRISTMAS LIGHTS BLINNG THEY'RNOTENERALLY SUPER BRIGHTNYWAY COMPARED TO THE SCHEME OF THINGS IN A BUSINESS DOING IT. IT WOULD BE MY HESITATION WITH THAT. IT'S LIKE OH, WE CAN MAKE THIS ONE CHANGE. IT'S ALL WRAPPED UP, WHICH I LIKE. WEAY THIS THG. LONGIME TO WORK OUT ALL OF THE KINKS. SO, FOR ME, IT'S MORE ABOUT THE UP LIGHTING AND THIS KIND OF STROBE QUALITY OF IT THAT'S THE BIGGER PROBLEM WITH IT THAN THE BLINKING. BUT IT'S PROBABLY HARD TO MAKE IT, I DON'T KNOW, FOR OTHER PEOPLE. I ALSO AM NOT GOING TO DIE ON THIS HILL. SO IF SOMEBODY ELSE HAS AN OPINION, I'M- AND I DO HAVE SOMETHINGSOME ELSE TO SAY, BUT LET'S FINISH THIS AND WE'LL MOVE ON TO THAT.
00:49:57.301: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS? IS
00:50:05.376: >> I WAS JUST GOING TO AGREE WITH COMMISSIONER GABE RANDALL. AROUND THE HOLIDAY TIME, PEOPLE HAVE TWINKLING, FLASNG, WHATEVER, AND I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS WHERE WE WANT TO -- YOU KNOW, IT'S A GOOD ORDINANCE AND I WOULD HATE FOR THAT TO BE THE BIG POINT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT IT. SO IF THERE'S A WAY TO SORT OF AVOID THAT, I'D BE IN FAVOR OF THAT.
00:50:29.433: >> I WONDER GIVEN -- I AGREE. THAT'S WHY I WASN'T GOING TO BRING IT UP UNLESS COMMISSION BRIGGS DID. IS THIS WHERE ONLY TEMPORARY INSTALLATIONS IN NONRESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS COULD COMPLY WITH THIS. THAT MEANS YOU COULDN'T HAVE BLINKING CHRISTMAS LIGHTS IN COMMERCIAL DISTRICTS. AND IF YOU HAD A HOUSE IN COMMERCIAL DISTRICT, I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT. THIS IS NOT THE HILL THAT I WANT TO DIE ON. THIS NEEDS TO BE PASSED. ALL OF THIS IS AN IMPROVEMENT FROM WHAT OUR CURRENT SITUATION IS. AND, SO.
00:51:07.872: >> YEAH.
00:51:16.013: >> THE NATURE OF THIS. ANTICIPATE NONCONFORMITY AND AMORTIZATION QUESTIONS. IN THIS REGARD, BECAUSE OF A TEMPORARY NATURE, I WOULD SAY IF IT WERE ENACTED LIKE THIS AND IT TURNS OUT THAT THE COMMUNITY EXPERIENCE IS ADVERSE, CHANGING THE PERMISSION OF A TEMPORARY INSTALLATION IS QUITE DFENT FROMERMANENT FIXED LIGHT TO A BUILDING. SO, I JUST SAY THAT AS IF IT WERE ENACTED AS IT IS CURRENTLY ENACTED, FOR EXAMPLE, AND THE COMMUNITY EXPERIENCE GENERALLY IS FINE OR ADVERSE, THIS IS AN AREA THAT I THINK YOU -- WITH ALL UNDERSTANDING OF MR. MURSKY'SONCERNS ABOUT HOW LONG THINGS CAN CHANGE, IT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN BE REVISITED, AND THAT WOULD HAVE SORT OF AN IMMEDIATE IMPACT BECAUSE IT WOULD BE TURNING A SWITCH TO SAY YOU COULD DO THIS TEMPORARY THING NOW. BUT BY ITS NATURE, IT HAS TO BE TEMPORARY. ESTABLISHED ITHAT REGARD.IS IF THAT MAKES SENSE. I HOPE IT DOES.
00:52:36.460: >> I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S A SUGGESTION THAT KE WITH PUT IT IN NOW, STRIKE IT LATER. OR GO WITH WHAT WE HAVE, WE CAN PUT IT IN LATER IF WE CAN SEE THAT PEOPLE ARE PUTTI -- THE KEY THI HERE IS THE STROBE LIGHTS AND THE SEARCHLIGHTS. SO I JUST COULDN'T READ. I DIDN'T GET THAT. COMMISSIONER BRIGGS.
00:52:57.448: >> I WOULD RECOMMEND IF WE CONTINUE WITH THIS AMENDMENT, WHICH I DO THINK COULD BE USEFUL, BUT HAVE IT PERTAIN TO COMMERCIAL AREAS THAT I THINK MORE, YOU KNOW, WE PROBLY -- IT'S NOT NECESSARILY APPROPRIATE TO HAVE A MUCH MORE INTENSE SEASONAL LIGHT FIXTURE IN A COMMERCIAL AREA ANYWAY. AND IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY PREVENT THEM FROM STILL HAVING SOME SEASONAL OPERATION THE. THAT'S -- B IT WOULD PREVENT THE -- THE STROPPE LIGHTS. THE BLINKING LIGHTS SEEMS APPROPRIATE. WE DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO BECOMES A PROBLEM, WE CAN T REVISIT IT. BUT IT'S SOMETHING I HAVE SEEN BE PROBLEMATIC IN SOME CASES.
00:53:58.809: >> BY NO MEANS PERFECT. GENERALLY I WOULD SAY THAT IF FROM A SAFETY DISTRACTION PERSPECTIVE THAT WHAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING WOULD BE CONSISTENT AS YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE LARGELY MORE -- ALL MODES OF TRAVEL OFTEN ON NONRESIDENTIAL COURSES AND DISTRICTS AS OPPOSED TO INTERIOR AND RESIDENT DISTRICTS. I DON'T THINK IT'S A PERFECT ALIGNMENT, GENERALLY, THAT MIGHT BE A BASIS TO DRAW THAT DISTINCTION THAT YOU DON'T WANT FLASHING STROBE LIGHTS FOR SOMEBODY AT A REALLIGH VOLUM INTERSECTION. THE OVERALL VOLUMES AND SAFETY CONCERNS MIGHT BE LESS.
00:54:51.862: >> SO, FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, SINCE I PUT THE MOTION FORWARD, I WOULDAKE I AA FRIENDLY ENDMENT TO MY MOTION TO RESTRICT THAT CAVEAT THAT TEMPORARY LIGHTING DISPLAYS NEED TO COMPLY WITH THE SECTION ON FLASHING, BLINKING, STROBING, ONLY ON NONRESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS. I CAN'T REMEMBER WHO SECONDED IT. COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN. SO THAT'S FRIENDLY TO YOU? OKAY. Y MORE DISCUSSN ON THAT? IS ALL IN FAVOR OF THE AMENDMENT THAT WOULD DO WHAT I JUST SAID, LIMIT THE STROBING FLASHING FOR THE TEMPORARY INSTALLATIONS IN COMMERCIAL IT SHALL IN NONRESIDENTIAL DIRICTS, DOOU WANT U TO DO A ROLL CALL VOTE?
00:55:43.180: >> NO, A VOICE VOTE IS FINE FOR THE AMENDMENT.
00:55:45.816: >> OKAY. I'LL RAISE YOUR HAND AND SAY AYE. AYE, ALL OPPOSED, RAISED YOUR HAND. OKAY. I THINK I SAW EVERYBODY. COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN, I WASN'T SURE, DID YOU VOTE
00:56:02.099: >> I DID. AYE.
00:56:03.767: >> THAT'S EVERYBODY. THE MAIN MOTION THAT WAS AMENDED. COMMISSIONER GIBB RANDALL, YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO ADD. SOME OF MY THOUGHTS ABOUT AMORTIZATION, WE'RE TRYING TO GET BEHAVIOR CHANGED. THE GULATORY ROA IS ONE WAY TO DO IT. I'M REMINDED OF A PHONE CL THAT CAME IN FROM THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION THE LAST TIME WE MET ABOUT A GUY WHO LIVED UP IN ESCONABA AND HAD A PASSION TO USE STYROFOAM USE WITHIN HIS COMMUNITY. THE STATE SAID YOU CAN'T REGULATE IT. AND HE'S DONE A HUGE EDUCATIONAL CAMPAIGN. HE HAD 95% COMPLIANCE IN ESCONABA WITH THIS. HE REACHED OUT TO PEOPLE AND MADE IT HIS MISSION. I THINK IN SOME WAYS THAT WOULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE TO REGULATING TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU CHANGE THE LIGHTBULB, YOU HAVE TO CHANGE IT. I THINK TT'S WHAT WE WERE TRYING T GO FOR IS THE BEHAVIOR CHANGE. THERE'S A LOT TOOLS IN THE TOOL BOX FOR THAT. PEOPLE HAVE NO CLUE WHAT THAT'S ABOUT. SOME SORT OF WAY TO REACH OUT TO PEOPLE IS PROBABLY GOING TO CHANGE MORE BEHAVIOR THAN SLAPPING THEM ON THE WRIST WHEN I THINK PEOE WAN TO DO THE RIGHT TNG GENERALLY IF THEY'RE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITYND THE NEXT TIME -- I GUESS THAT'S MY THOUGHT ON THAT IS THAT A LOT OF THESE THINGS WE DO, IT'S PEOPLE TALKING TO PEOPLE AND RAISING AWARENESS THAT ARE SOME OF THE BIGGEST TOOLS THAT WE HAVE FOR THESE THINGS. SO, I GUESS THAT'S MY TWO CENTS ON THAT. IS THAT I THINK THAT THE WORK IS JUST BEGINNI ON THIS. AND I THINKT NEEDS TO CONTINUE WAY BEYOND US PASSING THIS ORDINANCE. AND I'M SURE THE FOLKS THAT HAVE BEEN WORKING ON IT ARE KIND OF WEARY OF WORKING ON IT. IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME COMING. BUT I FEEL LIKE THAT'S REALLY WHERE WE'RE GOING TO GET RESULTS. THAT'S MY TWO CENTS.
00:58:13.764: >>R.ACKERMAN.
00:58:14.865: >> ANKS. I TOTLY AGREE, COMMISSIONER GIBB RANDALL. I THINK ONE OF THE POSITIVE THINGS THAT CAN COME OUT OF REGULATION TOO, EVEN IF IT'S NOT ENFORCED IS THAT THERE'LL BE A NEWS CYCLE OUT OF IT. THAT'S A BIG PART OF THE BENEFITS AROUND THE NO IETDLING ORDINANCE. IT'SARD TO BUT AT LEAST THERE'S BN FIVE NEW ARTICLES ABOUT IT. AND, HOPEFULLY, YOU KNOW, DOZENS OF PEOPLE READ THAT AND SAID, I DIDN'T REALIZE IF I LEAVE MY CAR IDLING FOR TEN SECONDS IT CREATES THE SAME AMOUNT OF EMISSIONS AS WHEN I TURN THE ENGINE BACK ON. MAYBE IAYBE THAT WILL INFORM SOME. I TOTALLY AGREE. I THINK THE TWO CAN GO TOGETHER. BUT, YEAH, WE'LL TALK TO OUR NEIGHBORS, THAT'S FOR SURE.
00:59:10.788: >> I'M GOING TO PIGGYBACK ON THAT. I'M OF THE SAME MIND. THE ONE PLACE I WANT TO PUSH BACK AND ASK A LITTLE MORE QUESTIONS, MR.EONARD ABOUT COMMENT AUT BEING EXPENSIVE. I CAN SEE FOR RETROFITTING, IF YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO ADD ONE PORCH LIGHT OR ADD ONE PORCH LIGHT AND YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH AND UPDATE THEM ALL, I COULD SEE THAT ADDING EXPENSE. PART OF -- WAS THE COMNT IN AT CONTEXT OR IHERE EVENCE THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE MORE NEW CONSTRUCTION.
00:59:44.922: >> I DIDN'T DO ANY -- I WANT TO BE CLEAR, I DIDN'T DO ANY DETAILED COST ANALYSIS. I MOSTLY THINK ABOUT AS THE ORDINANCE IS DRAFTED, WE HAD SOME CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS, YOU KNOW, PREVIOUSLY. SHOULD AN ELECTRICAL PERMIT FROM UR FRONTIGHT REPLACE YOUR CK LIGHT? AFF'S PERSPECTIVES THAT' NOT APPROPRIATE. IF YOU'RE REPLACING THE BACK LIGHT, HOWEVER, YOU'RE REPLACING IT, IT HAS TO BE COMPLIANT. YOU'RE REPAIRING IT OR MAINTAINING IT, YOU HAVE TO ENTERTAIN IT. THE COST IS GOING TO COME ON THE SITE PLAN SITE, ACTUALLY. IT WON'T BE AS SIGNIFICANT A COST FOR SORT OF ALANK -- BLANK SLATE NEW PROJECT WHERE I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH KNOWLEDGE OF THE COST FIXTURES. THERE'S SLIGHTLY LESS CHOICES. ANI ESUME, HO,HE INDURY IS GNG TO MOVE IN I THINK THE COST IMPLICATIONS IS PROBABLY FOR THE PROJECTS THAT MIGHT BE IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE OR PLANNING COMMISSION LEVEL. FOR EXAMPLE, RECENTLY YOU CONSIDERED A PROPOSED -- PROPOSED IMPROVEMENTS FOR RUDOLPH STEINER'S SCHOOL, HIGH SCHOOL, I BELIEVE. ORNO, GREEN HILLS, YOU KNOW? I FORGET WHICH, GREEN HILLS, I THINK. SO IN THAT CASE, THEY WERE DOING IMPROVEMENTS TO AN ATHLETIC FIELD, THE NATURE OF THOSE IMPROOUCHLS REQUIRED SITE PLAN UNDER THOSE PROPOSED ORDINANCE, THAT WHOLE SITE IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE BROUGHT UNDER COMPLIANCE. WHAT WE'RE DOING IS LOOKING AT THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE CODE FOR THAT WHOLE SITE. INCREASING THE COST OF THAT Y INVESTMENT BECAUSE THEY MAY -- IT'S ADDING ANOTHER COST ON TOP OF THE SORT OF FOCUS ON PERHAPS WHAT IS THE INITIAL WORK IS. THAT HAPPENS WITH OTHER THINGS. THAT HAPPENS WITH STORM WATER, THAT HAPPENS WITH PARKINGOTS. BUT I JUST WANTO ACKNOEDGE THAT I THINK THAT YOU -- YOU TALKED ABOUT THIS -- IT RESONATED THAT I WANTED TO BRING IT UP. WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS A LITTLE BIT IN OUR WORK SESSION THAT AS A COMMUNITY, WE HAVE -- WE HAVE ADDED A LOT OF REGULATIONS FROM VERY -- NOT ON WELEANI B PROPRIATE WAYS TODVANCE VERY APPROPRIE GOALS. ER CUMULATIVELY, THAT CAN MAKE DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGING. THAT WAS FRESH IN MY MIND. AND I JUST WANT TO BE -- I WANT OUR EYES TO BE OPEN AS WE THINK THAT TT MIGHT BE THAT MIG THIS, BE FUENG THAT PROBM. BECAUSE AS INDICATED, I THINK IT'S A WORTHWHILE ORDINANCE TO PURSUE, WE RECOMMEND. BUT I THINK IN THIS CASE, IT COULD, AS I SAID, INCREMENTALLY ADD BARRIERS AND CHALLENGE AFFORDABILITY OF DEVELOPMENT.
01:02:56.680: >> I,FIRSTOVER ALL APPRECIE THAT YOU BUGHT THAT UP AND YOU'RE THINKING AS WE'RE LOOKING AT CHANGES TO OUR CODE THAT YOU'RE REMINDING US ON THE AFFORDABILITY GOALS AND SUSTAINABILITY GOALS. I THINK WE NEED TO KEEP THOSE TWO THINGS TOP OF MIND WHEN EVER WE TALK ABOUT ANY ORDINANCE CHANGE. SO I THINK YOU'RE RIGHTN WHAT REQUIRE FOR SITE PLS, PARTICULARLY FOR REDELOPMENT. NEW DEVELOPMENT ANYWAY IS GOING TO HAVE TO COMPLY, IT DOESN'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE. IT'S REDEVELOPMENT. IN MY MIND, THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS -- THIS IS TIMELY TO BE TALKING ABOUT NOW AND HOPEFULLY GETTING PASSED NOW. BECAUSE I REPORTED OUT TO EVERYONE THE LAST ORC MEETING, WE WERE TALKING ABOUT WHEN -- WHAT ARE THE TRIGGERS,HIS IS THE DIRECON FROM CITY COUNCIL, WE'RE REVIEWING WHAT ARE THE TRIGGERS FOR SITE PLAN REVIEW? AND SHOULD SMALL THINGS REQUIRE CONFORMANCE OF ALL OF THE THINGS FOR BRINGING EVERYTHING UP TO CODE FOR A SMALL CHANGE. THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. SO I THINK PUTTING THIS IN THAT CONTEXT IS VERY, VERY HEFUL. WHERE I WOULD PUS BK IS THAT, YOU KNOW, MAYBE THERE ARE FEWER FIXTURES. YES, THINGS ARE MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION. WE WERE PRETTY CAREFUL TO TRY TO PUT THINGS THAT ARE NOT LIKE THE FARTHEST OUT THERE, YOU KNOW? WE THOUGHT THESE WERE REASONABLE. BUT ALSO, THE -- ONE OF THE GOALS OF THIS IS TO SAVE ENERGY, WHICH SHOULD SAVE MONEY, AND, SO, FOR NEW DEVELOPMENT, THIS LIKE THAT'THE GOAL OF IS. AND TO COMMISSIONER GIBB RANDALL'S POINT ABOUT EDUCATION AND -- AND TO WHAT COMMISSIONER BRIGGS WAS SAYING ABOUT THE OPERATIONS, LIKE, LETTING THE EDUCATION COMPONENT LETTING PEOPLE WHO HAVE PARKING LOTS KNOW YOU CAN AND IN FACT WE WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO TURN OFF THOSE LIGHTS AND SAVE THAT ENER OVERNIT, LIKE THAS ERE I THINK THERE A REA OPPORTUNITY. SO I'M SAYING THIS SO THAT ENERGY COMMISSION AND WHOEVER ELSE, YOU KNOW, CAN MASTER THAT AND DO THAT EDUCATION CAMPAIGN IS -- IS AWARE. I THINK THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY THERE. ON AMORTIZAON, I CAN ADD TO THAT. THERE'S A LOT OF CHANGES WE NEED ENERGIWISE. WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT THAT. WE'VE GOT A LOT OF BUILT ENVIRONMENT. AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO BRING THINGS UP TO BE ABLE TO REDUCE EMISSIONS, I THINK ERIC AND I DID NOT DO NEARLY AS MUCH AS SALLY. SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE SHE GS A SHT OUTEREND JOHN MURSKY. LIKE AT ALL OF THESE MEETINGS. BUT WE DONATED A DECENT AMOUNT OF TIME TO THIS OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST YEAR. SO I THINK THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT. BUT LIKE THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY OF SO MUCH OF OUR EXISTING HOUSING STOCK AND HOW TO GET THAT UP TO SNUFF IS, IN MY MIND, IS LIKE EVEN MORE PSSING. THERE ARE BIGGER SAVINGS THERE. BUT LIKE MR. LEONARD SAID, EVERYTHING HAS AN ADDITIONAL COST. SO WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT THAT AND HOW. BUT ALSO, IF YOU'RE DOING ONE THING, YOU KNOW, IF YOU'VE ALREADY -- IF YOU'RE ALREADY DOING SOME IMPROVEMENTS TO TIGHTEN THINGS UP, LIKE ONE OF THE THINGS YOU WORRY ABOUT IS, YOU UH KNOW, BUILD THE ELECTRIC -- TNGS AROUN YOU, ELECTRICAL FIXTURES ONE CONDUIT FROM THE OUTSIDE TO THE INSIDE. AND SO LIKE ARE THERE OPPORTUNITIES TO MAKE THIS NOT SO EXPENSIVE. SO DO WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT THAT BEYOND THIS PARTICULAR ORDINANCE? THAT'S THE COMMENT I HAVE ON AMORTIZATION. I SE THE COMMISSIOR SUAVE JUST SOOU KNOW, ONE MORE THIN WANT TO MAK SURE THAT THIS WORKS WITH WHAT WE HAVE IN THE SIGN ORDINANCE. BECAUSE THE INTENTION -- WE KNEW IT WOULD BE COMING SOON, TOGETHER. THE LIGHTING WITH THE SIGNS A SUBSET OF THE OVERALL LIGHTING. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT READS THAT WAY ANDOU GUYS ARE PREPAR FOR TH.
01:06:58.021: >> I BELIEVE IT DOES. YES. I WILL -- AS YOU MENTION THAT, I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SOMETHING THAT I DID A SORT OF MORE DETAILED ANALYSIS FOR YOU BECAUSE IT WAS A TOPIC. BUT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE IS CLEAR AS IT PROGRESSES, HOW THOSE TWO INTERRELATE.
01:07:15.705: >> WHAT WE DISCUSSED BEFORE, I WOULD ST REMIND YOU AND US IS POTENTIALLY THAT NOTE WITHIN THE SIGN ORDINANCE REFERENCING THE LIGHTING ORDINANCE, CLEARLY THIS -- THAT ONE HAS A TWO-WEEK, YOU KNOW, TWO-WEEK HEAD START ON THIS BEING APPROVED. WE'RE GOING TO CITY COUNCIL FOR APPROVAL. BUT MAYBE THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT -- THAT NEEDS TOE PART OF THATACKAGE IF IT MAKES SENSE TO JUST INSTEAD REFERENCE THIS. COMMISSIONER SUAVE?
01:07:51.474: >> THANK YOU. I HAD, I GUESS THE LOGICS QUESTION ABOUT THE KIND OF AFFORDABILITY AND DISCUSSING IT RELATIVE TO THIS ORDINANCE. VERSUS I WE LOOK AT PSING OUT OVALL SECTOR OF LIKE TRIGGERING AND PUTTING A LIST OF THINGS THAT ARE IN COMPLIANCE FOR A SMALLER PROJECT. SO, I GUESS MY CONCERN IS IF WE START LOOKING AT INDIVIDUAL PARTS OF ORDINANCES TO SAY, WE DON'T HIT A THRESHOLD. FIRST IS IN THE OVERALL KIND OF MECHANISOF THE ORDINANCE SAYING IN THIS THRESHOLD, YOU HAVE TO HIT THESE INGREDIENTS, VERSUS THIS THRESHOLD, YOU HAVE TO HIT MORE INGREDIENTS. SO, IT'S A BROADER QUESTION OF HOW WE MIGHT THINK ABOUT STRUCTURING OVERALL ORDINANCE WITHIN THOSE REQUIRED
01:08:40.490: >> I AGREE WITH THAT. CONCERN, MAYBE. THE UDC SETS OUR EXPECTATIONS FOR DEVELOPMENT, PERIOD. AND SO THE MORE THAT WE ADD REGULATIONS THAT SAY WE ARE SETTING THIS AN EXPECTATION PERIOD EXCEPT FOR THIS -- THIS, START ADDING COMPLEXITY D Y, WE COMPCATIONS AND CPROMISING THE USABILITY O OUR CODE. AND FROM AN EDUCATIONAL PERSPECTIVE, BEING ABLE TO CLEARLY ARTICULATE WHAT OUR EXPECTATIONS ARE. I AGREE. THE VERSION TAKES A STEP IN THAT DICTION, THE APPLICABITY CTION IS A LITTLE MORE KNEW NUANCED. THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS SAYS. THIS APPLIES TO ANY OUTDOOR LIGHTING, PERIOD. THAT'S THE STANDARD WE'RE TRYING TO APPLY, WHETHER IT'S A FRONT PORCH LIGHT OR A FULLY DEVELOPED LIGHTING PLAN FOR A PUD ALONG THE RIVER. IN EITHER CIRCUMSTANCE, OUTDOOR LIGHTING SHALL COMPLY WIT IT. AND ACCDINGLY BY SETNG THAT STANDARD, IT IS ZONING AND I HAVE TO TOTALLY UNDERSTAND THE -- I THINK IT FEELS A LITTLE DIFFERENT BECAUSE LIGHTING FEELS A LITTLE LESS PERMANENT. THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK, IT IS, IN FACT, THE SAME. SO, AEE WITH THAT NVERSATION. I THINK SE OF TT MIGHT HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE SITE PLAN, THRESHOLDS REVIEW, AND WHAT THOSE THRESHOLDS ARE. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S PART OF THAT IS WHAT ASPECT SHOULD IT BE ALL OR NOTHING, RIGHT NOW? SITE PLAN MEANS EVERYTHING IN THE ORDINANCE. MAYBE THERE SHOULD BE SITE PLAN, YOU KNOW LIGHT, WHICH IS EVERYTHING EXCEPT BICYCLE LIGHTING. YOU DON'T HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THOSE THINGS. I THINK MY PREFERENCE IS TO CLEAY END AS UNIFORMLY AS W CAN SE OUR EXPECTATIONS FOR HOW -- WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO TO ULTIMATELY GET TO, HOWEVER LONG IT TAKES.
01:11:07.136: >> MM-HMM. I THINK THAT'S HELPFUL. I THINK WHERE WE'RE AT DISCUSSING THE SPECIFICS OF THIS ONE, IT'S EASIER TO BE INCLUSIVE. BUT KEEPING THE NOTES AND THE HIGHLIGHTS OF, YOU KNOW, WHAT ARE THE LOHANGINGRUIT AND THE HIGH ISES, ONCEE CIRCLED BACK TO THAT CONVERSATION AT A HIGHER LEVEL. SO, I APPRECIATE BRINGING IT UP. I FEEL LIKE THIS FEELS REALLY SOLID.
01:11:35.865: >> GREAT, COMMISSIONER WOODS.
01:11:37.433: >> NOT TO ADD VERY MUCH TO WHAT THINK TH IS ALS AN EXAMPLE OF WHERE YOU CAN GO OVER ORDINANCES WITH THE FINE-TOOTH COMB SO MANY TIMES, YOU KNOW, I'M NOT SURE HOW MANY YEARS THIS HAS BEEN IN THE MAKING BY A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO CARE A LOT AND ARE EXPERT IN IT. YOU THINK IT'S ALMOST READY TO GO. AND THEN YOU SEE THAT THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE THAT PERHAPS COLITES THE ISSUE. AND THOSINDS OF THIS ARE -- THEY ADD TIME. I WAS JUST SITTING HERE THINKING ABOUT, YOU KNOW, NOW WHEN WE GET A SITE DEVELOPMENT, IT JUST SEEMS NORMAL FOR US TO TALK ABOUT STORM WATER. WELL, YEAH, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BRING YOUR STORM WATER UP TO SPEED AND ALL LIKE THAT. AND MAYBE WE'LL BE LIKE THAT ABOUT LIGHTING T EVENAL. I APPRECIATE ALL THE TIME THAT PEOPLE PUT INTO IT. IN SOME CASES WE CAN'T MAKE IT A QUICK PROCESS BECAUSE IT'S SO COMPLEX. THANK YOU, ANY OTHER COENTS. ALL RIGHT, I THINK WE'RE READY FOR A ROLL CALL VOTE THEN, COMMISSIONER LEONARD -- SORRY, NOT COMMISSIONER LEONARD, MR. LEONARD.
01:12:59.015: >> THE PROPOSE TO RECOMMEND THE OUTDOOR LIGHTING AMENDMENTS SUBJECT TO THE AMENDMENT TO CLARIFY THAT TEMPORARY LIGHTS IS OUTSIDE RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS ARE SUBJECT TO DISTRICTS ON FLASHING, BLINKING, IN SUB 10 OF 5 TNT 253, SUB B. GOOD?
01:13:22.538: >> YES.
01:13:24.874: >> STARTING WITH COMMISSIONER GIBB RANDALL?
01:13:26.342: >> YES.
01:13:28.811: >> COMMIIONE ACKERMAN
01:13:30.513: >> YES.
01:13:32.215: >> COMMISSIONER SUAVE?
01:13:34.050: >> YES.
01:13:35.852: >> COMMISSIONER ABRONS?
01:13:41.891: >> YES.
01:13:43.126: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS?

01:13:48.498: >> COMMISSIONER BRIGGS?
01:13:50.433: >> YES.
01:13:51.801: >> YES.SIONER MILLS.
01:13:53.903: >> COMMISSIONER MILLSHTEYN?
01:13:55.104: >> YES.
01:13:56.572: >> IT IS UNANIMOUS.
01:13:58.007: >> VERY GOOD. SO, THIS NOW GOES ON TO CITY COUNCIL. THE NEXT ORDER OF BUSINESS IS 9B. CHAPTER 55F THE UDC.ENTS TO THERE ARE ENUMERATED AMENDMENTS THAT I WOULD PREFER JUST TO HAVE ALEXIS WALK US THROUGH BEFORE I READ THE WHOLE THING IF THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
01:14:26.769: >> IT'S OKAY WITH ME. BUT YOU HAVE TO ASK HER.
01:14:30.206: >> ALL RIGHT.
01:14:30.873: >> I ASSUME THAT YOU'RE GOING TO TALK TO US ABOUT ALL EIGHT THAT ARE INHE SCRIPT RE. SO, ION'T -- I WON'T NAME THEM ALL BEFORE YOU DO. 
01:15:54.857: >> HOPING FOR A LITTLE BIT OF A VISUAL. I THINK YOU PREFER TO LOOK AT THAT. ALL RIG. HERE WE GO. OKAY, SO WE PROPOSED A SLATE OF AMENDMENTS. I WILL GO THROUGH A LITTLE BIT QUICKLY. PLEASE STOP ME OR ASK ANY FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS. BUT BECAUSE WE'VE DONE THIS ONCE FASTER. I'LL GO A LITTLE BIT WEAVE AN AMENDME PROPOSED T E TITLE AND THE KEY OF TABLE 5.15.1 PRIMARY USE TABLE AND 5.15-2, ACCESSORY USE TABLE. WE DELETED THE WORD PERMITTED FROM THE TITLES. AND WE DELETED UNUSED SYMBOLS FROM THE KEY. WE ALSO PROPOSED AN AMENDMENT FOR THE SECTION TO SECURITY FOR COLETION OSITE IMPROVEMENTS TO DO IORDER TO GET A YOU HAVE CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY AND WHAT TYPES OF THINGS YOU CAN PUT UP A BOND FOR FOR INCOMPLETE WORK. WE ARE PROPOSING CHANGES TO POST SECURITY FOR ANY SITE IMPROVEMENT. IT'S CURRENTLY LIMED TO LANDSCAPING, UNINSTALLED LANDS ESCAPING OR PAVEMENT. WE DID IT THE END OF THE YEAR. WE ADDED SOME THAT YOU CAN'T JUST BOND BECAUSE YOU'RE LAZY. YOU HAVE TO HAVE A LEGITIMATE PURPOSE. WE HAVE AN AMENDMENT FOR THE PERMITTED BUILDING MATERIALS IN THE D1 AND D2 DISTRICTS DOWNWN. WE'REOING TO CALL O FIBER CEMENT BOARD AS THE TRIM ONLY. PROPOSE AN AMENDMENT IN THE WAY YOU DETERMINE FAR. THIS IS NOT EVERY ZONING DISTRICT, BUT IT'S THE ZONING DISTRICTS WHERE FAR COMES INTO PLAY. AND WE'RE GOING TO SAY THAT LOT AREA INCLUDES LAND THAT'S DONATED FOR PUBLIC SIDEWALK EXPAION. IN ALL DIRICTS, WE SAY THAT YOUR LOT AREA, YOUR FAR CAN INCLUDE THE PUBLIC SERVICES. WE'RE GOING TO ADD LAND EXPANSION FOR THAT. WE HAVE SOME CORRECTIONS IN T PRIMARY U TABLE, MIJUANA OCESSORS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE PERMITTED. WE'RE GOING TO CHECK THAT CELL. THE ACCESSORY USE TABLE, IT'S A CORRECTION TO THE USE TABLE IN THE R2A DISTRICT TO ALLOW ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS. VARIOUS EDITIONS OF THE UDC THAT HAVE BEEN APPROVED WITHOUT THIS, WE'RE GOING THROUGH A FULL ORDINANCE AMENDMENT RATHER THAN JUST CORRECT IT AS AN ERROR. WE HAVE A CORRECTION TO THE FENCE GRAPHIC LABELS FOR FRONT YARD AND SIDE YARD. THE DINSNAL TABLES S. EVIOUSLY SAI THEY WERIN PROGRESS, WEAVE COMPLETED THEM. HERE'S AN EXAMPLE. WE HAVE MOVED A LOT OF THE FOOT FOOTNOTES FROM THE FOOTNOTES TO THE BODY OF THE TABLE, MORE NUMBERS, LESS REFERENCING. I PUT ONE EXAMPLE IN TO THE POWER POINT. BUT IN THE PACKET, IT THE FL AMENENTS FOR EACH OF THE TAES. ERE ARE FIV OF THEM, A SINGLE FAMILY, DIMENSIONAL STANDARD TABLE, TWO FAMILY, A MULTIFAMILY TABLE, A MIXED USE TABLE, AND A NONRESIDENTIAL AND SPECIAL PURPOSE DISTRICT TABLE. STAFF IS RECOMMENDING APPROVAL OF THESE. THESE WILL CORRECT ERRO. FAIRLY MORCHANGES. THEY WILL IMPROVE FUNCTIONALITY AND USABILITY AND IMPROVE THE FLOW OF THE DEVELOPMENT IN THE CITY. AGAIN, I KNOW THAT I WENT THROUGH THEM FAST BECAUSE WE DID COVER THIS BEFORE, BUT I'M HAPPY TO GO THROUGH ANY SECTION IN MORE DETAIL. SO PLEASE FIRE AWAY. 
01:20:13.649: >> ALL RIGHT, NOW WE'LL OPEN THIS. THIS IS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO SPEAK UP TO THREE MINUTES ABOUT PROPOSED AMENDMENTS. PUBLIC COMMENT CAN BE MADE BY CALLING THAT 877 NUMBER, MEETING ID, 985-77787699. CITY STAFF WILL SELECT CALLERS WHO HAVE RAISED THEIR HAND, AND YOU CAN RAISE YOUR HAND BY PRESSING STAR 9 ON YOUR PHONE. MR. LEONARD WILL CALL OUT THE LAST THREE DIGITS OF YOUR PHONE NUER A LET YOU KNOW YOU'RE EE TO SPEA IF YOU DO CHOOSE TO SPEAK, PLEASE MUTE ANY BACKGROUND SOUNDS AND STATE YOUR NAME AND RECORD -- STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS FOR THE RECORD, SORRY. WE'LL GIVE IT A LITTLE BIT OF TIME TO SEE IF THERE'S A DELAY. IF ABODY WANTS TO LL IN. I DON'T SEE ANYBODY. SO.
01:21:21.350: >> NO.
01:21:21.917: >> WE'LL CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING AND I WILL READ THE MOTION THAT HAS ALL OF THE NUMBERS IN IT. THMOTION THE ANN AOR CITY COMMISON RECOMNDS THAT THE MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL APPROVE THE AMENDMENTS TO CHAPTER 55 UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE SECTIONS 5.16.6.D. 5.28.8, 5.17.6.C, 17.4, AND 5.26.2.A INCLUDING TABLES 5.15-1, 5.15-2, 5.17-1, 5.17-2, 5.17-3, 5.17-4, AND 5.17-5. TO ALLOW ACT SAYSEDRY DWELLING UNITS  THE R2A DTRICT, EXPANDECURITYOR THE COMPLETION OF IMPROVEMENTS, REGULATE FIBER CEMENT BOARDS, PROVIDE RIGHT OF WAY FOR SIDEWALKS IN FAR DETERMINATION, CORRECT OFFENSE GRAPHIC, CORRECT MARIJUANA PROCESSOR USE PERMISSION, AND CORRECT DIMENSIONAL STANDARDS TABLES. THAT ISOVED BY COMMIIONER SUAVE, SECONDE BY COMMIIONER WOODS. NOW WE ARE IN DISCUSSION. COMMISSIONER MILLSHTEYN?
01:22:46.302: >> QUICK QUESTION. WITH REGARDS TO THE PUTTING UP THE BOND FOR ANYTHING, CAN YOU STF NTS TO CHANGE? S TO WHY CITY IS THEREOMETHING THAT'S BEEN HAPPENING OR SPECIFIC REASON WHY WE'RE DOING THIS?
01:23:07.056: >> WE'VE SEEN SOME -- EITHER MULTI- -- WE'VE SEEN SOME MULTI-BUILDING PROJECTS AND LARGER DEVELOPMENTS. I'VE GOT A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE IN THE STAFF REPORT THAT I'LL REPEAT FOR EVERYONE. IMAGINE LARGISH BUIING THAT'S GOING TO HAVE 50 CONDOMINIUM UNITS IN IT. A FIVE-STAR BUILDING, 50 CONDOMINIUM UNITS IN IT. WE'LL MAKE IT UP. THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE 50 BICYCLE PARKING RACKS. SO, THEY BUILD THE BUILDING TEN ITS ARE COLETE. ANTHEY PUT A OF THE LANDSCAPING OUND, THEY' GOT THEONCRETE ALL POURED. THEY PUT IN TEN BIKE RACKS FOR THE -- FOR THE UNITS THAT ARE COMPLETE. THE OTHER ONES THAT ARE NOT COMPLETE, THEY DON'T HAVE BUYERS. WE WOULD REQUIRE THEM TO INSTALL OFF NOW. BUT BECSE THEY' NOT COMPLETE, THERE'S NO REASO TO INSTALL THE OTHER 40 WHEN THERE'S NO PEOPLE THAT NEED THEM AT THAT MOMENT. SO THAT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT MIGHT BE USEFUL TO BOND FOR CONCEIVABLE SIMILAR SITUATION FOR SAY A PROJECT IS SUPPOSED TO -- IT'S SO LARGE, IT'S SUPPOS TO HAVE THR DUMPSTE ENCLOSUR. BUT THEY BUILD BASICALLY A THIRD OF IT. SO AT THE TIME, THEY ONLY NEED ONE. THEY CAN'T BOND FOR THAT RIGHT NOW. THAT'S THE EXAMPLE WE'VE COME THROUGH. THERE EVE BEEN SOMEWHERE. IT'S NOT THAT THEY WANT TO DO ALL OF THE IMPROVEMENTS BUT THEY'D LIKE SOME OF THE IMPROVEMENTS TO BE A LITTLE MORE PROPORTIONAL TO WHAT THE PROCT IS ANY OTHER COMMENTS, QUESTIONS, COMMISSIONER WOODS?
01:25:04.406: >> ALEXIS, IN TERMS OF THAT AR THERE A REASONS TT YOU  US WOD NOT WANT TO DO THAT? HAVE YOU HAD ANY EXAMPLES OF PROJECTS THAT DON'T GO TO COMPLETION BUT THEY DO BECAUSE I'M ASSUMING THEY WOULD NOT HAVE A CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY YET EITHER.
01:25:25.227: >> YEAH, THIS WOULD BE IN ORDER TO GET THAT CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY. I THINK AN EXAMPLE OF WHER WE WOULD SA NO, THAT'S NOT APPROPRIATE IS THEY DON'T WANT TO INSTALL ANY LANDSCAPING BECAUSE THEY MIGHT GET TORN UP BY THE CREWS. THE LANDSCAPING GOES FOR EACH UNIT. SO THE PEOPLE WHO MOVE IN ARE ENTITLED TO A LANDSCAPE PROJECT. YBEIMILAR TO A PLAYGROUND EQUIPMT. THEY D'T WANT TO SOLVE THE PLAYGROUND EQUIPMENT BECAUSE THEY WOULD LIKE TO USE THAT AREA FOR STAGING. WELL, THE FIRST RESIDENTS ARE ENTITLED TO THE SAME AMENITIES AS THE LAST. THAT'S NOT A PROPORTIONAL THING THAT WOULD NOT BE APPROVED. ACCEIB IS THATE DPPEDLD NOT BE THE BL AND WE NEVER ORDERED ENOUGH BIK RACKS. SO, CAN WE JUST MOVE IN WOULD THEM? NO, THAT'S NOT OUR FAULT. THAT'S NOT PROPORTIONAL AND THAT'S NOT REASONABLE.
01:26:24.520: >> OKAY. THANK YOU. ER
01:26:30.492: >> COMMISSIONER MILLSHTEYN?
01:26:32.428: >> I UNDERSTAND WHY THE PLAYGROUNDS COME IN FIR WHE THEYTART CONSTRUCTION,EVEN. THERE'S A LOT OF NEIGHBORHOODS WITH NO PLAYGROUNDS.
01:26:42.304: >> I'M BIG ON THAT. THE FIRST RESIDENTS ARE ENTITLED TO ALL OF THE SAME AMENITIES AS THE LAST.
01:26:49.111: >> I WOULD JUST ADHERE THAT I REALLY APPRECIATE THE STAFF AND I REALLY LIKE HOWOUTS UP. DIVIDED THEM OUT BETWEEN CORRECTIONS THAT, AGAIN, FOR THOSE WHO AREN'T AROUND, THE UDC WAS A HUGE UNDERTAKING. ALEXIS DID AN AMAZING JOB. BUT IT WAS HUNDREDS OF PAGES. THERE WAS A SENSE THAT SOMETHING MIGHT NOT MAKE IT IN THE TRSLATION. WOULD BE BITAND PIECES TO CORRECT. AND I APPRECIATE MAKING THAT CLEAR. BUT ALSO MAKING CLEAR THE THINGS THAT ARE UPDATES. AND, SO, THANK YOU. I WOULD JUST SAY LIKE ZONING IS A LIVING DOCUMENT. AND SOMETIMES WE'RE TAKING -- WE'RE LOOKING AT ENTIRE SECTIONS. BUT SOMETIMES IT'S AS --SR. LEONARD WA MENTIONING BEFORE, YOU KNOW? IT'S A SINGLE SENTENCE THAT COULD BE STRUCK OR ADDED IN OR TWEAKED, THE DEFINITION THAT COULD BE TWEAKED AS WE'RE DOING FOR FAR. WITH THE SIDEWALKS THAT, YOU KNOW, IT -- ONCE WE DO IT, IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE WRITTEN IN STONE FOREVER.
01:28:01.617: >> I APPREATE THE COMMENTS. I AGREE WIT YOU. IT'S MEANT TO BE CONTINUALLY REVISED TO BOTH IF YOU FIX SOMETHING, BUT ALSO TO REFLECT OUR CURRENT VALUES.
01:28:10.192: >> RIGHT.
01:28:11.093: >> AND, AGAIN, IT APPLIES, WE KNOW, THAT IT ONLY APPLIES FOR THE NEW THINGS THAT ARE COMING. THAT THE THINGS THAT ARE THERE RIGHT NOW, LIKE THAT'SOT REALLY THE CASE. CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT. HOPEFULLY THOSE VALUES. THERE'S NO -- ANY OTHER COMMENTS? COMMISSIONER BRIGGS?
01:28:35.817: >> I'M JUST HOPING THAT YOU COULD GO IN, JUST EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT MORE THE -- THE LIMIT DONATED TO 5.17.4, THE SIDEWALKS? CALCULATN AND FAR. I KNOW WE CAN KIND OF EXPLAIN THAT. IF YOU COULD ELABORATE ON THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE ON THAT FOR ME?
01:28:54.803: >> SURE. I HAVE TO DO A LITTLE REFIGURING OF -- I'LL GET THE -- I'LL GET THE SPECIFIC WORDING HERE. SO, WHERE THIS CAME UP, JUST ONE PROMPTED US TO THINK ABOUT IS. BUT WE - WE THINK IT MIGHT COME UP AGAIN. SO, IT'S -- IT'S WORTH ADDRESSING, WE BELIEVE. BUT THE FLOOR AREA IS BASED ON THE LOT AREA. AND IT'S BASED ON THE FINAL LOT AREA. SO IF ANY LAND IS DONATEDOR WHATEVER REASO ORAND VISIONS THAT'S NOT TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT. AND WE RECENTLY HAD A PROJECT IN THE -- IN THE DOWNTOWN AREA THAT THE SIDEWALK WAS VERY NARROW. AND THEY -- THEY -- I'M HAVING A E SIDEWAAS VERY NARROW.ISSUE. ANDHEY WERE HESITANT TO DONATE AN EIGHT-FOOT STRIP OF LAND BECAUSE DOWNTOWN HAD NO HEIGHT. EIGHT FEET, THAT CAN ADD UP TO A LOT OF FLOOR AREA RATIO WHEN YOUR LAND AREA IS SMALLER. TO NOT PENALIZE SOMEONE FOR WHERET COMES TO PLA,HIS THIS IS THE ORIGINAL PREMISE, ALSO, OF TAKING DENSITY BEFORE YOU DONATE ANY PARKLAND. WE DIDN'T WANT TO PENALIZE ANYONE AND CREATE A DISINCENTIVE FOR DONATING PARKLAND. THIS IS NOT SO MUCH OF AN NOT PENALID.UT AT LEAST THEY'RE STREETS THAT ARE QUITE -- THAT ARE -- THE STREET IS FAIRLY WIDE AND THE SIDEWALK MEANS IT'S FAIRLY NARROW. TO GET THAT WIDE SIDEWALK COMFORTABLE WITH, THERE'S SITUATIONS WHERE WE'RE GOING TO NEED ADDITIONAL LAND. AND WE DON'T WANT TO PENALE ANYONE WITTHEIR PRECIOUS SQUARE INCHES AND MAKE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO CONTEMPLATE HELPING OUT AND FULFILLING THE DOWN DOW DOWNTOWNED STREET DESIGN MANUAL. GETTING ALL OF THE AMENITIES THAT YOU WANT. IT'S GOING TO COME DOWN AGAIN AND WE WON'T RUN INTO THE SAME DISTANCE WE HAD IN THE PAST PROJECT.
01:31:27.823: >> THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS? ALL GHT, M ONARD,HINK ARE READY FOR A ROLL CALL VOTE ON THE MOTION AS IN THE PACKET?
01:31:50.879: >> COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN?
01:31:52.013: >> YES.
01:31:52.981: >> COMMISSIONER SUAVE?
01:31:53.648: >> YES.
01:31:56.585: >> COMMISSIONER ABRONS?
01:32:00.422: >> YES.
01:32:00.655: >> COMMISSIONER WOODS?
01:32:01.590: >> YES.
01:32:05.427: >> CMISSIONER BRIGGS?
01:32:10.265: >> YES.
01:32:10.766: >> COMMISSIONER MILLS?
01:32:12.300: >> YES.
01:32:12.968: >> COMMISSIONER MILLSHTEYN?
01:32:14.736: >> YES.
01:32:15.370: >> COMMISSIONER GIBB RANDALL?
01:32:17.139: >> YES.
01:32:17.372: >> IT IS UNANIMOUS.
01:32:21.076: >> VERY GOOD, THE MOTION CARRIES. ALL RIGHT. BUSINESS.ITEM OF UNFINISHED THIS ISNC, THE REVIEW OF THE CITY PLANNING COMMISSION BYLAWS. WE'LL HAVE THE STAFF PRESENTATION BUT THERE'S NOT A PUBLIC HEARING ON THIS.
01:32:41.363: >> YES. SO, AS IS -- AS IS PRESENTED IN MATTER, THE PROPOSED BYLAWS THE PLANNING COMMISSION SHOULD REVIEW THE BYLAWS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. THIS TIME, WE HAVE PROPOSED QUITE A SERIES OF CHANGES, MOST OF THEM ARE LARGELY TO PROVIDE A BIT MORE CONSISTENCY WITH THE TEMPLATE THAT OTHERS USE IN THE CITY. PREVIOUSLYO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE CHANGES, WE'VE SIMPLIFIED SOME NUMERIC REFERENCES, MADE SOME LABEL CHANGES, FOR EXAMPLE, MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC IN PLACE OF CITIZENS, PUBLIC COMMENT IN PLACE OF AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION. AND MADE REFERENCE T OTH CITY COCIL ENACTED STAARDS F TRANSPARENCY. MIGHT BE BEYOND THE OPEN MEETINGS ACT. WE ELIMINATED SECRETLY THE SECRET BALLOT MISSIONS FOR ELECTED OFFICERS. WE CHANGED -- WE ADDED PLANNING MANAGER AUTHORIZATION TO CANCEL A MEETING IN THE EVENT WHERE IT'S DETERNED THA NO BUSINESS GOING TO BEN THE AGEA OR WE KNOW WE W'T HAVE A QUORUM. ADJUSTMENTS TO PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY AND THE ORDER OF THE AGENDA IF WE WANT TO PLAY WITH THE TYPICAL STRUCTURE OF OUR AGENDA. TH VIOLENT HAD THE LANGUAGE AT WAS A BIT OF A REFERENCE TO THE PREVIOUS REQUIREMENTS WHERE THE PLANNING COMMISSION -- I'M SORRY, JUST DID A BAD THING. HOLD ON. WHERE THE PLANNING COMMISSION USED TO HIRE THE - SORRY ABO THAT, COMMISONER MILLS. I G A LITTLE TOO -- I GOT A LITTLE SLOPPY WITH THE MOTION. WHERE THE PLANNING COMMISSION USED TO HIRE THE PLANNING DIRECTOR, THE POSITION IS ACTUALLY VERY DELIBERATELY CHANGED SINCE THAT TIME. I'M THE PLANNING MANAGER, NOT THE PLANNING DIRECTOR AND N RESPONSIE TO AINISTRATIVE CHANGES INHE CITY AS OPPOSED TO DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION. BUT, THAT LANGUAGE STILL MAINTAINS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR YOUR FEEDBACK TO THE COMMUNITY SERVICES AND AREA ADMINISTRATOR ON ANY PERFORMANCE OF THE EVALUATION. WE REMOVED THE OPPORTUNITY FROM THE PUBLIC HEARI PROCESS AS DISCSED IN THE PREVIOUS REVIEW. I WOULD JUST ASK -- I THINK THE PLANNING COMMISSION IS VERY EFFECTIVE WITH THAT. BUT I THINK THAT WORKS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE PLANNING COMMISSION'S LONG HISTORY OF BEING DILIGENT RESPONDING TO QUESTIONS AND SORT OF THOSE THAT COME UP THROUGH THE PUBLIC HEARING PROCESS AND PRESENTATION PROCS. SO- AND WE HA -- I ADDED THE CHAIR'S DISCRETION TO THE SPEAKING TIME. THAT'S THE GENERAL PUBLIC COMMENT TO APPLY TO ALL PUBLIC HEARINGS RELATED TO THE AGENDA ITEMS. SO, BASED ON THE SUCCESSFUL INTEGRATION HOPEFULLY OF THE TWO ITEMS THAT WERE OF SPECIFIC INTEREST IN THE LAST ESENTATION, I WOULD RECOMMEND THE ADOPTION OF THESE. AFTER THAT, THEY ADDRESS THE CITY COUNCIL FOR THEIR ADOPTION.
01:36:12.040: >> VERY GOOD.
01:36:12.907: >> THANKS.
01:36:14.376: >> I HEARD IT. I WAS JUST DEMOTED.
01:36:17.045: >> SORRY.
01:36:20.348: >> SO, THE MOTION HERE IS.
01:36:21.816: >> I WONDER WHO WILL BE NEXT?
01:36:23.585: >> OH, EXACTL THE INNER CITY PLANNING COMMISSION MOVES TO APPROVE THE BYLAWS AS PRESENTED. WILL SOMEBODY MOVE THAT COMMISSIONER MILLSHTEYN? SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER ABRONS? DISCUSSION OF THE MOTION? COMMISSIONER BRIGGS?
01:36:52.647: >> THANKS FOR ALL OF THE UPDATES TO THESE. THERE WAS ONE SECTION THAT I HAD A QUESTION ABOUT. IT WAS ON MEMBERSHIP, SECTION 4.8. IT SAYS IF A MEMBER MISS MORE AN THREEEGULARLY SEDULED IN A ROW OR MORE THAN FOUR IN A SIX-MONTH PERIOD, THE CHAIR SHALL NOTIFY CITY COUNCIL. I WANTED TO CLARIFY, DOES MEANING ALL MEETINGS, REGULAR MEETINGS, WORKING SESSIONS. COMMITTEE MEETINGS. IS THAT WHAT THAT'S INTENDED TO MEAN
01:37:35.223: >> I THINK I WOULD -- THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION. I WOULD INTERPRET THAT AS REGULAR BUSINESS MEETINGS. I THINK THE INTENTION IS TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS ADEQUATE ATTENDANCE AND PRESENCE IN -- IN THE ILIT TOONCT A BUSINESS AND IN THE EVENTS THAT YOU HAVE AN ONGOING QUORUM ISSUE AND THE LIKE, I THINK THAT'S WHERE AN ATTENDANCE CONCERN WOULD BE MOST -- SORT OF HAVE THE MOST IMPACTED CAUSE FOR CONCERN. I DON'T SAY THAT AND I DON'T THINK WORKIN SESSIONS A COMMITTEE MEETIS ARE APPROPATE, THOSE ARE CREATURES OF THE PLANNING COMMISSION, WHICH IS SPEAKING TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION AT LARGE. SO, I RECOGNIZE THAT WE CAN RECOGNIZE THAT WE COULD PROBABLY READ IT IN NUMEROUS WAYS. BUT THAT'S HOW I READ IT. THE CORE CONCERN IS THAT WE WANT PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO BE PUTTING IN THE TIME SO WE CAN CONDUCT BUSINESS.
01:38:42.490: >> I THINK THE INTENT IS GOOD. I WORRY LESS WITH THE THREE CONSECUTIVE AND THE FOUR TO 16 MONTH PERIOD AND A LITTLE LESS WHEN IT'S THE REGULAR MEETINGS. STILL 32 MEETINGS AND SUGGESTED THATHE CHAIR IS I KNOW T CY COUNCIL HOPEFULLY THE CITY COUNCIL WILL ALWAYS BE UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR VOLUNTEER COMMITMENTS. BUT, I THINK I'M A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS ABOUT THAT SHALLOW LANGUAGE AROUND THE FOUR MEETINGS THAT MEMBERS MIGHT POIBLYMISS. ANESPECIALLYF THAT GETS INTERPRETED AS THOSE ADDITIONAL MEETINGS. THAT COULD BE -- RIGHT NOW, 64 MEETINGS IN A PERIOD LIKE, YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE ON THE ORDINANCE MEING CHANGES THAT TOAY MEANING SHAL OBVIOUSLY WEE HOLDING THE MEETINGS. I WANT TO RAISE THAT AS A HOME.
01:39:52.560: >> I DID -- FOR ME, I SORT OF HAD THE PREVIOUS CHAIR. AND I TNK AT THE TIME WE MIGHT VE BEEN PARTILARLY DOWN A COMMISSIONER. AND I THINK AT THAT TIME, SORT OF AGREED THAT -- THAT THEY DIDN'T SEEM PRODUCTIVE WHEN THEY DIDN'T HAVE A FULL COMMISSION AT THE OUTSET TO REALLY SPEND A LOT OF TIME POLICING THIS. WE DIDN'T MAKE IT MORE FLEXIBLE. THE FEEDBACK I GOT, THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE OTHER BYLAWS AND OTHER BOARDS OR COMMISSIONS. I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH OPPORTUNITY THERE IS FOR THE PLANNING COMMISSION TO HOLD ITSELF OUT SEPARATE FROM THAT SORT OFCONVENTI, HOWEVE I DO THINK REPORTING TO THE CITY COUNCIL IS GOING TO DISTINCT FROM A LOT OF OTHER BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS. SO, I APPRECIATE IT. I HAVE THE SAME THOUGHT. IT DIDN'T SEEM VIABLE TO ACTUALLY CHANGE THAT BECAUSE THIS IS A VERY CONSTENT PROVISIOTHAT APPLIES BROADLY. I CAN SAY IN MY TIME HERE, IT'S EVER% AN ISSUE IN THE TIME THAT I'VE BEEN HERE. BUT, IN SHORT, I CONCUR WITH A LOT OF YOUR OBSERVATIONS ABOUT IT. I THINK AS PRESENTED, IT'S APPROPRIATE.
01:41:36.097: >> COMMISSIONER MILLSHTEYN?
01:41:39.467: >> I THINK THIS IS THE YEAR AGO I BELIEVE MR. LEONARD AND I DID DISCUSS THAT. I THINK THAT'S FAIR. WE DIDED TO LEAVE THA ALONE D I WOULD JUST -- BECAUSE IT'S AN ISSUE AND I NEVER HAD TO SEND A NOTE TO CITY COUNCIL IN IN MY TWO YEARS AS CHAIR. I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DISCUSS NEXT YEAR IN THE REVIEWS AHEAD. AND MEANWHILE BETWEEN NOW AND OUR -- WHAT OUR ATTENDANCE REALLY IS LIKE AND WHAT OUR DATES ARE FOR ALL OF THE MEETINGS AND COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT THE CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE WOULD BE AGREEABLE WITH. SO, I DON'T THINK IT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD POSTPONE OR DO CHANGES BUT WE SHOULD REVIEW FOR NEXT YE. AS WE PPARE TO REEW THE BYLAWS THIS TIME NEXT YEAR, WE SHOULD DO AT THAT TIME.
01:42:41.596: >> I WAS CALLING ON COMMISSIONER MILLSHTEYN?
01:42:47.335: >> ALMOST EVERY YEAR THIS COMES UP LIKE WHEN WE REVIEW THIS. BECAUSE I THINK, YOU KNOW, COMMISSIONER BRIGGS' MATH ON HOW MANY MEETINGS WE HAVE, IT DOEST TAKE MUCHO MISS THAT MANY. FOR BETTER OR WORSE, COVID MEANS WE'RE NOT TAKING VACATIONS BECAUSE YOU CAN BE LIKE COMMISSIONER BRIGGS AND JOIN US FROM VACATION. ATTENDANCE THIS SUMMER HAS BEEN MUCH HIGHER. IT'S --RAVELLING FOR WORK OR GETTG SICK, HEAVEN FORBID, LIKE ALL OF THOSE THINGS, FLEXIBILITY RECOGNIZING HOW OFTEN WE MEET, I THINK, IS REGU REGULARLY SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD KEEP COMING BACK TO.
01:43:32.980: >> YEAH. I -- AND I THINK, AGAIN, I THINK THE INTENTION IS TO MAKE SURE BUSINESS IS CONDUCTED AND I THINK IT'S -- THINKRANKLY SOMEWHAT VALUAE TO THE CY COUNCIL THA IF THERE IS AN ISSUE AND BEING ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH, HAVING SOME DEFINED MEASUREMENT OF SATISFACTORY OR NOT. THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT'S FRANKLY BEING POLICED ON THIS VERY AGGRESSIVE WAY. BUT IT PROVIDES A CLEAR DELINEATION IF A PROBLEM DOES NEED TO BE ADDRESD.
01:44:05.413: >> COMMISSIOR ABRAMS. COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN, YOU'VE BEEN UNMUTED. I WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU DIDN'T HAVE YOUR HAND UP BEFORE AND I MISSED IT.
01:44:14.255: >> I WAS GOING TO SAY, I THINK -- I SUPPORT THE IDEA OF THERE BEING A METRIC, BUT THE QUESTION I SAI WAS FOUR MEETGSN 16 MONTHS WHI SEEMS ARBRARY OR NEXT YEAR, WE CAN TAKE IT UP. AND I THINK THE GOAL FOR ME IN THAT CONVERSATION WOULD BE NOT TO PUT THE CHAIR IN AN UNCOMFORTABLE POSITION, RIGHT? CITY UNCIL.S SHALL INFORM THE IT'S THE INREACH O THE BYLAWS, MORE THAN THE COMMISSIONERS WHO ARE ABSENT ARE IN BREACH OF THEIR COMMITMENT, RIGHT? IT DOESN'T SAY IF YOU MISS X NUMBER OF MEETINGS YOU RELIEVE -- YOU GIVE UP YOUR SEAT, IT SAYS THAT THE CHAIR HAS TO DO SOMETHING. SO, ANYWAY, I JUST.
01:45:03.571: >> TO BE CLEAR, EVEN IF THE -- EVEN IF THAT IS REPORT, IT DOESN'T REPT IN ANY IEDIATE TION. AT THA INT,IT'S JT SHARING INFORMATION.
01:45:12.680: >> SO, BUT ANYWAY, SO, YEAH, I WOULD SUPPORT US TAKING IT UP AGAIN, I GUESS, NEXT YEAR. I DON'T AGREE WE SHOULD POSTPONE FOR NOW FOR THAT. BUT --
01:45:24.892: >> ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS? ALL RIGHT? DO YOU WANT TO ROLL CALL VOTE, MR. LEONARD?
01:45:37.672: >> I'M OKAY WITH A VOICE VOTE IF THE BOARD IS.
01:45:40.908: >> ALL RIGHT. ALL IN FAVOR OF THE BYLAWS AS DRAFTED, PLEASE SAY AYE OR RAISE YOUR HAND?
01:45:47.548: >> AYE. AT'S NO ONE. , IT CARRIES UNANIMOUSLY. ALL RIGHT, NOW WE'RE ON TO REGULAR BUSINESS. WE HAVE ONE ITEM HERE.
01:46:11.505: >> 559 RIVERVIEW DRIVE ANNEXATIONNDONING FORITY UNCIL APOVAL. WE'LLAVE THE STAFF PRESENTATION A A PUBLIC HEARING.
01:46:22.984: >> THIS IS A PETITION BY A PROPERTY OWNER BY 559 RIVER VIEW DRIVE TO SEEK ANNEXATION TO THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR FOR ULTIMATE ACCESS TO UTILITY CONNECTIONS. THE SI IS LOCED IN THE -- IN THE -- NEAR THE HURON RIVER ON RIVERVIEW DRIVE. IT IS IN AN AREA THAT IS IMMEDIATELY SURROUNDED BY R1B ZONES AND TOWNSHIP COMMERCIALS. THE PRERTY IS A SINE FAMILY HOME THAT PROPOSED ANNEXATION IS WITHIN THE CITY'S PROPOSED SERVICE BOUNDARIES AND THE PROPOSED R1B ZONING IS WITH THE CITY'S MASTER PLAN. WE RECOMMEND APPROVAL.
