00:02:29.291: >> ADAM HUGHES IS MY NAME, MY ADDRESS IS 212 EAST WASHINGTON STREET, I WOULD LIKE TO FIRST AND FOREMOST THANK YOU GUYS FOR HEARING ME OUT TONIGHT, I AM HERE TO KIND OF SPEAK ON THE SHORT-TERM RENTAL AGENDA ITEM THAT GOT PASSED TWO WEEKS APPEARING AT CITY COUNCIL. I'M NOT GOING TO SPEND TOO MUCH TIME TALKING TO YOU ABOUT HOW MUCH I DISAGREE WITH MOVING FORWARD WITH OPTION 3 BUT RATHER I'LL SPEND TIME FOCUSING ON SOMETHING I FEEL IS A LITTLE BIT MORE IMPORTANT AND THAT I THINK THAT THERE IS KIND OF A NEGATIVE RHETORIC BEING PAINTED AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT I'M SENSING ON FROM CITY COUNCIL WHEN TALKING ABOUT SHORT-TERM P RENTALS AND THOSE WHO OPERATE THEM. THE VIBE I'M GETTING IS THAT MOST PEOPLE ARE ASSUMPTIVE THAT SHORT-TERM RENTAL OWNERS ARE AN ABSENTEE OWNERS THAT DON'T PARTICIPATE IN THE COMMUNITY AND DON'T SCARE ABOUT THEIR NEIGHBORS AND I FEEL LIKE I WOULDN'T BE SERVE HE CAN THE COMPANY THAT I WORK FOR AND PUT SO MUCH TIME AND EFFORT INTO IF I DIDN'T SPEAK UP AND KIND OF SHARE WITH YOU GUYS A LITTLE BIT HOW WE OPERATE SO WE HAVE RENTALS LONG-TERM AND SHORT-TERM AND I'M JUST HERE TO TELL YOU THAT THERE ARE PROPERTY OWNERS AND RENTAL OWNERS THAT TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY AND OPERATE THEM WITH HONESTY AND INTEGRITY. WE ENGAGE OUR COMMUNITY, WE LIKE BEING ACTIVE MEMBERS OF OUR NEIGHBORHOOD, YOU KNOW, I THINK ALL OF THIS STUFF HAS KIND OF BEEN BROUGHT TO LIGHT AND HAS THIS NEGATIVE CLOUD OVER IT BECAUSE OF SOME UNFORTUNATE EVENTS THAT OCCURRED AND WHETHER IT'S PARTIES OR THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED WITH THE SHORT-TERM RENTALS IN THEM, I THINK THAT JUST TAKING THAT NEGATIVE CLOUD AND PUSHING DIRECTLY INTO A FULL OUTRIGHT BAN WHICH OPTION 3 KIND OF -- WHAT ESSENTIALLY OPTION 3 IS, I THINK IT DOESN'T GIVE A FAIR SHAKE TO THE PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT ARE DOING IT CORRECTLY. WE'RE KIND OF BEING PUT IN THIS SITUATION OF GUILTY UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT RATHER THAN INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY AND I JUST THINK THAT IT'S NOT QUITE FAIR. SO YEAH, SHOULD WE REGULATE IT AND PUT SOME MORE PARAMETERS AROUND IT? SURE. I MEAN, FOR THE PEOPLE THAT OPERATE THESE PROPERLY AND CARE ABOUT THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD IT'S NOT GOING TO BE AN ISSUE FOR THEM TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE DOING IT THAT WAY AND HOPEFULLY CAN WEED OUT SOME OF THE BAD APPLES. BUT MOVING FORWARD BINARY WITH OPTION 3 AND TAKING THESE OUT OF COMMISSION COMPLETELY JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE, AND YEAH, I WANT YOU GUYS TO KNOW THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT HERE THAT DO IT PROPERLY, THAT CARE ABOUT BEING ACTIVE MEMBERS OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND WE PROVIDE A PRETTY SWEET AND PRETTY COOL EXPERIENCE TO PEOPLE THAT COME INTO ANN ARBOR AND WANT TO EXPERIENCE THIS PLACE JUST LIKE THE SIT DISPLENS WHO LIVE HERE. SO -- THE CITIZENS WHO LIVE HERE SO THANK YOU SO MUCH.
00:05:21.330: >> Planning Manager: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO WISHES TO ADDRESS?
00:05:29.538: >> MY NAME IS CAROL SCALLA. I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT WE MET WITH ELIZABETH NELSON AT HER SUNDAY COFFEE HOUR THIS PAST WEEK AND I WAS REALLY SHOCKED TO HEAR HER COMMENTS, I ASKED HER, I SAID BACK IN OCTOBER WHEN WE FIRST STARTED TALKING ABOUT THIS CARLISLE REPORT AND WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN AND I GOT AN E-MAIL FROM HER WHERE SHE SAID OH, I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE TO WORRY, YOU KNOW, YOU NON-OWNER- OCCUPIED HOSTS, CITY COUNCIL IS NOT GOING TO GO IN THAT DIRECTION, IT'S NOT OUR INTENT TO PUT YOU GUYS OUT OF BUSINESS, AND BASICALLY THAT'S WHAT THEY DID, OR THEY'RE TRYING TO DO. SO I ASKED HER AT THE COFFEE, YOU KNOW, WHAT CAUSED THIS CHANGE OF HEART? BECAUSE SHE VOTED FOR IT, AND SHE SAID, WELL, YOU KNOW, WE REALLY DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF INFORMATION, WE DON'T THINK THAT THE REPORT WAS VERY GOOD, AND, YOU KNOW, A LOT OF MEMBERS ON COUNCIL JUST SORT OF FEEL THAT THIS IS AT ANY TIME A GOOD THING TO IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD. WELL, THAT WAS SHOCKING TO ME. YOU DON'T HAVE A GOOD REPORT, YOU DON'T HAVE GOOD DATA, YOU'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND PUSH SOMETHING THROUGH THAT'S GOING TO PUT PEOPLE OUT OF BUSINESS, AND FOR WHY, BECAUSE YOU HAVE A FEELING THAT YOU DON'T WANT THESE PEOPLE? I AM THOSE PEOPLE. I AM A HOST. WE HOST PRIMARILY FAMILIES IN OUR HOME. I HAVE A FAMILY COMING FROM IRAQ IN A WEEK TO STAY FOR FIVE WEEKS WHILE THEIR FATHER GETS A STEM CELL TRANSPLANT AT U OF M. I CHALLENGE ANYBODY TO SAY THAT I'M A BAD NEIGHBOR. I KNOW MY NEIGHBORS. WE HAD A FAMILY COME IN THIS PAST WEEK TO MEET THEIR GREAT GRANDCHILD FOR THE FIRST TIME. THE WOMAN CAME OUT AND HELPED ME SHOVEL THE WALK AND ENGAGED MY NEIGHBORS WHO WERE OUT SHOVELING THEIR WALK, SHE SAID, YOU KNOW, IT WAS SO GREAT TO BE HERE, LOVELY NEIGHBORHOOD. IF THAT'S BEING A BAD NEIGHBOR, I DON'T KNOW. SO I REALLY AM ASKING YOU GUYS TO START THINKING ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE RATHER THAN JUST ACTING ON THE MANDATE FROM COWRCH SILL -- FROM COUNCIL BECAUSE I THINK THAT THE MANDATE FROM COUNCIL WAS ILL PREPARED, ILL-ADVISED, SMALL MINDED AND RUSHED TO JUDGMENT. THANK YOU.
00:08:02.658: >> Planning Manager: THANK YOU.
00:08:09.064: >> HEY, GUYS. HEIDI POSHER, 1204 BROOKLYN. I'M JUST GOING TO ADD ON QUICKLY TO WHAT CAROL SAID. THE OTHER THING THAT ELIZABETH INFORMED US WAS THAT, BECAUSE WE WERE REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT OPTION 3 BEING THE OPTION THAT WAS PUT INTO THE ORDINANCE, AS OPPOSED TO ONE OF THE OTHER OPTIONS THAT WAS LESS, I'M GOING TO SAY, DRACONIAN, I HOPE I DON'T OFFEND ANYBODY BY SAYING THAT. BUT THE RESPONSE THAT WE GOT WAS , WELL, WE HAD TO GO WITH OPTION 3 BECAUSE THAT WAS ONLY OPTION THAT THE CITY FELT THAT THEY COULD ENFORCE. WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT ENFORCEMENT AND THE GIVE AND TAKE AND BACK AND FORTH ABOUT HOW HARD OR EASY THAT MIGHT BE. YOU KNOW, I WILL VOLUNTEER MY SERVICES, I'LL VOLUNTEER MY STAFF'S SERVICES, WE'LL ROUNDTABLE THIS WITH ANYBODY WHO WANTS TO TALK TO US. WE AS MY EMPLOYEE ADAM MENTIONED , WE ABIDE BY ALL THE RULES, YOU KNOW, WE DON'T HAVE POLICE CALLS, WE DON'T HAVE ISSUES, WE DON'T HAVE COMPLAINTS WE'RE GOOD NEIGHBORS, AS HE MENTIONED. I THINK THAT THE WAY WE DO THINGS AND THE WAY MOST SHORT-TERM RENTAL OWNERS DO THINGS ARE 98 PERCENT OF WHAT WOULD NEED TO BE INCORPORATED INTO A SET OF BYLAWS THAT WOULD REALLY ENABLE EVERYBODY TO GET ALONG WELL AND TO ELIMINATE THE ISSUES. I WILL JUST SAY, I'M HERE TO DISPUTE ANYBODY'S ISSUES THAT THEY'VE HAD. I'M HERE TO JUDGE THEM OR DOWNPLAY THOSE. YOU KNOW, WE'VE HAD ONE AIRBNB WHERE COMPLETE STRANGERS STAYED TOGETHER AND THEY SHARE A COMMON AREA BUT THEY HAVE SIX DIFFERENT SUITES, WE'VE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH PEOPLE NOT GETTING ALONG OR ANYBODY FEELING THREATENED. SO I WOULD LIKE TO IS IT CHALK THAT UP TO BEING PREPARED BEFOREHAND, HAVING A GOOD SET OF RULES, HAVING CODES OF CONDUCT, BEING AVAILABLE 24/7, HAVING THOSE GUESTS KNOW THAT THEY ARE ACCOUNTABLE TO A SET OF RULES. ALL OF THOSE THINGS WORKING TOGETHER, I THINK YOU CAN USE THOSE TO REALLY RUN A PRODUCTIVE BUSINESS THAT DOESN'T ENDANGER, HARM OR THREATEN ANYBODY ELSE. SO WE ARE HERE, WE ARE READY TO WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION. WE ARE EXPERIENCED. WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR A LONG TIME, AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE THAT OFFER NOW BECAUSE SIRCHG WE CAN BE HELP -- BECAUSE I THINK WE CAN BE HELPFUL. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
00:10:41.950: >> Planning Manager: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION REGARDING AN ITEM THAT'S NOT ON THE AGENDA?
00:10:51.760: >> MY NAME IS KATHY IT STRIKEEN, I LIVE AT 1310 IS ORKIN, I DON'T WANT TO REPET A LOT OF WHAT THEY SAID BUT IN TERMS OF THE REPORT I ALSO HAD GONE TO ELIZABETH'S COFFEE AND HER WORDS WERE THE REPORT FROM CAR CARLISLE IS PATHETIC AND THAT WAS A DIRECT QUOTE. MY CONCERN IS THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF EMPHASIS FROM YOUR GROUP OR I THINK IT GOT SENT TO YOUR GROUP TO REALLY LOOK AT OPTION 3 AS A STARTING POINT AND I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO MAKE THE SUGGESTION THAT YOU AM LOOK AT OPTION 1 AND START THERE AS YOUR FRAMEWORK IN TERMS OF HOW TO REGULATE SHORT-TERM RENTALS. AS ADAM SAID, I THINK EVERYBODY IS OKAY ABOUT GET THE PERMIT, SEFORT OCCUPANCY, WHATEVER YOU NEED TO DO, MOST OF THE PEOPLE HAVE DONE THAT AND I THINK RIGHT NOW THERE'S A LOT OF DATA THAT NEEDS TO BE COLLECTED IN TERMS OF THEY GO WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY ARE OUT THERE, DWOAPT KNOW WHERE THEY ARE. WELL, IN MY OPINION THAT'S WANT ROCKET SCIENCE, IN JULY YOU COME UP AND YOU SAY WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR FINAL REPORT YOU NEED TO BE REGISTERED OR WHATEVER IT IS BY A CERTAIN DATE AND THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE IN IT SO YOU'RE NOT ALL OF A SUDDEN CHANGING THE RULES ON PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD THIS BUSINESS FOR HOWEVER MANY YEARS, THREE, FOUR, YEARS, MIGHT BE LONGER. THERE WAS SOME CONCERN ABOUT OH, YOU'RE OPERATING A BUSINESS IN A RESIDENTIAL AREA. WELL, IF THIS WAS A CONCERN, THEN HOW COME SOME OF THESE CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCIES THAT ACTUALLY SAID SHORT TERM RENTALS WERE ALLOWED? I KNOW THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENCE S IN THE ZONE GZ BUT I GUESS MY POINT IS I WOULD REALLY LIKE YOU TO MAKE YOUR STARTING POINT OPTION 1, DEFINITELY GET A HANDLE ON HOW MUCH HOW MANY OF THESE SHORT-TERM RENTALS THERE ARE, AND YES THERE ARE SOME BAD INSTANCES THAT HAVE BEEN GETTING A LOT OF NOTORIETY, BUT THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD EXPERIENCES THAT ARE BEING PUSHED TO THE SIDE OF THESE FEW THAT ARE RATHER EXTREME, I'LL SAY. SO ANYWAY, THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I HOPE THAT YOU'LL SERIOUSLY LOOK AT OPTION 1 AS BEING YOUR STARTING POINT. THANK YOU.
00:12:59.120: >> Planning Manager: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION? SEEING NO ONE, WE'LL MOVE ON ON OUR AGENDA, NEXT ITEM IS PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULED FOR THE FEBRUARY 24TH, 2020 PLANNING COMMISSION MEETING.
00:13:24.112: >> WE HAVE THREE PETITIONS SCHEDULED FOR THAT MEETING. SOMEONE THE GARNET PLAN UNIT DEVELOPMENT AND SITE PLAN, THIS IS A PROPOSAL TO REZONE A .2 ACRE PARCEL FROM C1B TO PLAN UNIT DEVELOPMENT FOR 10 UNIT CONDOMINIUM BASIS, 14 LOWER LEVEL PARKING SPACES, PETITION CAME THROUGH PREVIOUSLY, DENIED BY CITY COUNCIL AND PETITIONER IS SEEKING APPROVAL OF THE PROJECT THROUGH THE PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT ZONING CATEGORY, THEN A PROPOSED REQUEST FOR ANNEXATION AND ZONING BY A PROPERTY -- SINGLE FAMILY PROPERTY OWNER TO ANNEX THE PROPERTY FROM ANN ARBOR TOWNSHIP INTO THE CITY AT 1780 CIO CHURCH ROAD, FINALLY PRE POSED AMENDMENTS TO CITY'S REQUIREMENTS TO SITE PLANS, AREA PLANS AND REQUIRED PLAN INFORMATION SPECIFICALLY TO CLARIFY THE SITE PLAN FOR SPECIAL EXCEPTION USES.
00:14:25.140: >> Planning Manager: THANK YOU. NOW WE MOVE ON TO UNFINISHED BUSINESS, THE FIRST AND THE ONLY ITEM IN OUR UNFINISHED BUSINESS IS MSGCU CREDIT UNION SITE PLAN, PARTIAL REZONING FOR CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL AND SPECIAL USE FOR PLANNING COMMISSION APPROVAL , WE'LL BEGIN THIS ITEM WITH A PETITIONER PRESENTATION, YOU'LL HAVE UP TO TEN MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION, WE'LL THEN HEAD ON TO MISS THACHER FOR STAFF REPORT AND THEN A MOTION AND DISCUSSION AND A VOTE.
00:14:57.605: >> GOOD EVENING. MY NAME IS JOHN BETALLI, I'M WITH THE FIRM STUCKEY AND BATTAL LI ARCHITECTS. I HAD A QUESTION BEFORE WE PROCEED WITH THE PRESENTATION, UNDERSTANDING THERE'S ONLY SIX COMMISSION MEMBERS AND THAT WE WOULD REQUIRE A VOTE OF ALL SIX TO PASS OUR PROPOSAL. IS THE ABILITY TO TABLE THIS AT ANY TIME DURING THE PRESENTATION , OR IS THERE -- WHAT -- CAN WE GO AHEAD WITH THE PRESENTATION AND THEN TABLE IT AT A LATER TIERNLINGS OR --
00:15:32.240: >> Planning Manager: SO THE TABLE F WE DECIDE TO TABLE, IT WOULD COME FROM THE PLANNING COMMISSION, SO IF ONE OF THE PLANNING COMMISSION MEMBERS MOVES TO TABLE.
00:15:40.448: >> I SEE.
00:15:42.383: >> Planning Manager: -- IT WILL COME TO A VOTE TO TABLE AND THEN WE'LL GO FROM THERE.
00:15:45.320: >> OKAY.
00:15:45.687: >> TO BE CLEAR, INITIATING THE PRESENTATION DOESN'T FOREGO THAT OPTION.
00:15:49.357: >> I APPRECIATE THAT, THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO CLARIFY. WELL, AGAIN, THIS EVENING WE'RE PRESENTING A NEW FACILITY FOR MICHIGAN SCHOOLS AND GOVERNMENT CREDIT UNION. SO THE CREDIT UNION OF COURSE HAS BEEN A VERY SUCCESSFUL CREDIT UNION AND IS VERY INTERESTED IN LOCATING IN THE ANN ARBOR COMMUNITY. OUR FIRM STUCKEY AND BATALLI ARCHITECTS, WE HAVE BEEN IN BUSINESS OVER 50 YEARS, OUR FIRM IS WELL ESTABLISHED, HAS DONE A LOT OF WORK IN THE ANN ARBOR COMMUNITY AS WELL AS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES. MYSELF PERSONALLY, I'VE BEEN ON A PLANNING COMMISSION OVER 25 YEARS PERSONALLY, SO I HAVE A FEEL FOR SITTING BEHIND THE DESK AS YOU DO TONIGHT. INCLUDED IN OUR TEAM IS STONE FIELD ENGINEERING, A NATIONAL ENGINEERING FIRM WIT EXPERIENCE, AGAIN, IN VARIOUS STATES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. IS I'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE HISTORY OF THE PROJECT. THE PROJECT, WE STARTED EN ENGAGING WITH THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR IN JANUARY OF 2019, AND THAT'S WHEN WE STARTED OUR PRE SUBMITTAL DISCUSSION. THE PLANNING COMMISSION MEETING THAT WE WENT TO ON DECEMBER 3, 2019, ACTUALLY ALMOST ELEVEN MONTHS AFTER WE STARTED THE PROCESS, INTRODUCED THE IDEA THAT NO DRIVE-THRUS MIGHT BE CONSIDERED. SO I JUST WANTED TO MAKE THE POINT THAT, YOU KNOW, THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS, IN WORKING WITH THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT, THAT'S NEVER REALLY COME UP, AND ALTHOUGH WE'VE GOTTEN FULL APPROVAL FROM PLANNING STAFF AND PLANNING AND ENGINEERING, THE DISCUSSION ABOUT NO DRIVE-THRU TO REDUCE THE CARBON FOOTPRINT WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT WAS PRESENTED TO US. SO OUR CLIENT HAS REALLY PUT FORTH A LOT OF DUE DILIGENCE AND HARD WORK, MONEY AND TIME INVESTED IN GETTING THIS PROJECT TO THIS POINT. AND YOU KNOW, THERE'S REALLY NO WRITTEN ORDINANCE OR WRITTEN DIRECTIVE OR ANYTHING THAT REALLY TALKS ABOUT REDUCING THAT CARBON FOOTPRINT. SO THAT'S THE FIRST TIME WE WERE MADE AWARE OF IT WAS AT THAT MEETING. SO I WOULD LIKE TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT DRIVE-THRUS IN GENERAL SO FOR CREDIT UNIONS, THE DRIVE THROUGH IS AN ESSENTIAL PART PIECE OF THEIR BUSINESS MODEL. IT PROVIDES CONVENIENCE TO THE MEMBERS, IT PROVIDES ACCESSIBILITY TO PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND THE ELDERLY, PEOPLE THAT ARE CAREGIVERS, PEOPLE WITH CHILDREN, YOUNG CHILDREN, IT PROVIDES CONVENIENCE FOR THEM, AND THE IDEA THAT LESS DRIVE-THRUS CREATES LESS CARBON FOOTPRINT I THINK IS A LITTLE BIT UNFOUNDED AS WELL BECAUSE LESS DRIVE THIEF THRUS PROVIDE LONGER WAITING LINES, MORE LINES, A LOT MORE CARS, SO THE IDEA OF REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF DRIVE-THRUS IS NOT REALLY HELPFUL I THINK IN THE IDEA OF REDUCING THE CARBON FOOTPRINT. BUT EVEN THE IDEA OF A CARBON FOOTPRINT REDUCTION BY NO DRIVE- THRUS IS NOT REALLY TOTALLY PROVEN. IN FACT, I QUOTE IN ONE OF OUR SLIDES, WE HAVE A QUOTE FROM RWD I WHICH IS AN INTERNATIONAL ENGINEERING FIRM AND THEY'RE SPECIALISTS IN ENVIRONMENTAL CONSULTING, A QUOTE FROM THEM SUGGESTS JUST THE OPPOSITE. THE CONGESTION THAT OCCURS IN PARKING LOT TOGETHER WITH THE STARTUP EMISSIONS AND EMISSIONS FROM SPLES TRAVEL DISTANCE TO AND FROM THE SPACE -- EXPRESS TRAVEL DISTANCE TO AND FROM THE SPACE ALL CONTRIBUTE TO EXPRESS SOME HIGHER LEVEL EMISSIONS COMPARED TO A BUSINESS THAT HAS A DRIVE-THRU AND THIS IS AN INTERNATIONAL FIRM, SO I GUESS I'M SAYING THAT THE IDEA OF JUST ELIMINATING DRIVE-THRUS IS NOT REALLY THOROUGHLY VETTED AND THOUGHT OUT, SO I MEAN, THE IDEA OF LOWERING THE CARBON FOOTPRINT IS ADMIRABLE, AND I THINK THAT WE CAN'T DISPUTE THAT AND WE DON'T DISAGREE WITH THAT EFFORT. BUT I THINK THERE ARE OTHER THINGS, TOO, THAT MIGHT BE EVEN A HIGHER PRIORITY IN REDUCING THE CARBON FOOT PRINT THAT MIGHT BE CONSIDERED BESIDES REMOVING A DRIVE-THRU. SO CREDIT UNIONS ARE NOT A HIGH VOLUME PEDESTRIAN DESTINATION EITHER. CREDIT UNION MEMBERS NEED THE CONVENIENCE OF A DRIVE-THRU. SO I WILL LET MIKE BLANACK FROM OUR FIRM, WE DID LISTEN TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION AND WE MADE A NUMBER OF REVISIONS AT YOUR SUGGESTION, SO WE RESUBMITTED A LOT OF THESE REVISIONS, AND MIKE CAN GO THROUGH THOSE RIGHT NOW.
00:20:45.620: >> SO IF YOU GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE, THE SITE PLAN, FROM THE MEETING WE HAD IN DECEMBER, THE REVISIONS WE MADE, ONE OF THEM WAS THE LANDSCAPING, SO WE'VE TAKEN THE LANDSCAPING THAT'S RIGHT AT THE ENTRANCE COMING OFF OF WEST STADIUM BOULEVARD AND HAVE TRIMMING AND NOTES TO KEEP THE BRANCHES AT A CERTAIN HEIGHT , ADDED PEDESTRIAN WALKUP ATM TO THE FRONT ENTRANCE, SO THERE WAS CONCERN ABOUT BICYCLE TRAVEL COMING THE REAR WITH THE ATM OR WALK-UP, SO WE'VE KIND OF GIVEN BOTH OPPORTUNITIES FOR WALK-UP AND BICYCLE, AND OUR BICYCLE, YOU KNOW, STATIONS THERE ARE RIGHT NEXT TO THE ENTRANCE AND THAT'S RIGHT TO STADIUM BOULEVARD SO THAT'S GOOD VISIBILITY, WE PROVIDED FOR THAT , THERE WAS ANOTHER ABOUT ADDING A SIDEWALK ON THE SOUTH SIDE FROM ARBOR FARMS SO PEOPLE THAT MAY BE PARKED OVER THERE WOULD RUN OVER TO THE ATM OR CREDIT UNION SO WE HAVE A SIDEWALK THAT RUNS THE ENTIRE LECT THERE ON THE SOUTH SIDE TO ALLOW FOR THAT OCCURRENCE FOR THEM TO HAVE A PATH TO GET TO THE FRONT OF THE BUILDING OR COME OUT OF THE BUILDING AND GO OVER TO ARBOR FARMS, WE'VE PROVIDED FOR THAT, WE'VE ALSO REDUCE MED THE AMOUNT OF ASPHALT PAIG, PULLED THE SITE IN, GOT RID OF THE LOADING ZONE AND WE'VE ACTUALLY REDUCE IT HAD FROM 36 PERCENT COVERAGE TO 32 PERCENT COVERAGE SO WE'VE REDUCE MED THE PAVEMENT ON THE ENTIRE SITE BY THE 4 PERCENT, WE ALSO I KNOW THERE'S A DISCUSSION ABOUT TRYING TO GET CROSS-ACCESS TO THE ADJACENT PROPERTIES BOTH TO THE NORTH AND SOUTH, WE RHEA LINED THE SOUTH SO IT'S NOT DIRECTLY FRONT OF THE DRIVE THRU SO WHEN YOU COME OUT OF THE DRIVE THRU YOU MAKE A TURN AND THEN GO AROUND THE SITE TO EXIT T WE CAN HAVE THAT CROSS ACCESS AT THIS PARTICULAR MOMENT BUT AS PLANNING STAFF PROVIDED FOR YOU AT THE LAST MEETING, WE'RE SHOWING IT IN OUR PLAN, SO IF THE FUTURE PROPERTY IS DEVELOPED, WE WOULD HAVE IT IN PLACE. AND THERE WAS ALSO DISCUSSION WE WOULD PROVIDE A CROSS-AXIS EVEN -- ACCESS EVEN THROUGH WORKING WITH THE PLANNING IN THE FINAL VERSION OF THIS, SO THAT'S NO PROBLEM. WE ALSO PROVIDED A NORTH NOW CONNECTION POTENTIAL AND WE'VE LINED THEM UP, TWO WAY, 24-FOOT WIDE, TRAFFIC GOING BOTH WAYS THROUGH THIS STIET. SO THAT'S ANOTHER CHANGE WE MADE SO WE TRIED TO TIGHTEN THIS AS TIGHT AS WE CAN GET IT, WE'VE TRIED TO ALIGN THE PARKING AND THE DRIVING AREAS SO THEY MAKE SENSE AND HOPEFULLY THAT CROSS- ACCESS WILL BE AVAILABLE TO US IN THE FUTURE. SO THOSE ARE THE CHANGES WE MADE TO THE SITE PLAN BASED ON YOUR FEEDBACK FROM THE LAST MEETING. THANK YOU.
00:23:16.771: >> HI, I'M STEVE BREWER, I'M THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER FOR MICHIGAN SCHOOLS AND GOVERNMENT CREDIT UNION, I JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW THAT WE'RE REALLY INTERESTED IN BEING A PART OF YOUR COMMUNITY, WE HAVE 15 BRANCHES IN 13 OTHER COMMUNITIES , AND WE ARE A VERY GOOD COMMUNITY PARTNER, EVERY CITY WE DO BUSINESS WITH WOULD GIVE US A GOOD REFERENCE AS FAR AS OUR COMMITMENT TO THE COMMUNITY, OUR INVOLVEMENT IN THE COMMUNITY, KEEPING THE PROPERTY UP IN EXCELLENT CONDITION, JUST LIKE JOHN MENTIONED FOR HIS FIRM WE'RE A 50-PLUS--YEAR-OLD COMPANY, WE'RE THE LARGEST CREDIT UNION HEADQUARTERED IN MACOME COUNTY AND WE'RE THE TOP 2 PERCENT OF ALL CREDIT UNIONS IN THE UNITED STATES. WE HAVE EXCELLENT FINANCIALS AND WE WOULD BE A VERY GOOD PARTNER FOR YOUR COMMUNITY. WE WOULD REALLY LIKE TO BE HERE. I HAVE SOME INFORMATION ABOUT OUR EFFORTS IN THE DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES, FROM 2019, I WOULD LIKE TO PASS OUT TO YOU AS WELL.
00:24:18.165: >> STEVE, I THINK WE GOT THESE.
00:24:19.834: >> YEAH, THEY GOT THEM.
00:24:21.035: >> THAT'S OKAY.
00:24:26.574: >> IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, WE WOULD BE GLAD TO ANSWER THOSE.
00:24:29.710: >> ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO MISS THACHER FOR THE STAFF REPORT.
00:24:41.355: >> I DON'T HAVE MUCH TO ADD. THE ONE OBVIOUS BIG THING THAT WASN'T ADDRESSED IN THIS REVISED SITE PLAN WAS THE CONCERN ABOUT HAVING DRIVE THRU LANES IN THE FIRST PLACE, BUT THEY HAVE CHOSEN TO RESUBMIT WITH THREE DRIVE-THRU LANES AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE.
00:24:58.539: >> GREAT.  THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. AT THIS TIME I WOULD LIKE TO OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING, IF THERE'S ANYONE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION IN REGARDS TO THIS ITEM, YOU WILL HAVE THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION. STEP UP TO THE PODIUM, STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS FOR THE RECORD. SEEING NO ONE, I WILL CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING AND I WILL READ THE THREE MOTIONS THAT WE HAVE BEFORE US. AND WITHOUT OBJECTION, WE'LL TAKE ALL THREE TOGETHER. GREAT. MOTION NUMBER 1, THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION -- SORRY, WE HAVE FOUR MOTIONS, OFFICER ONE OKAY TAKING ALL FOUR OF THEM TOGETHER? ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU. MOTION NUMBER ONE, THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION HERE BY RECOMMENDS THAT THE MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL APPROVE THE MICHIGAN SCHOOLS AND CREDIT UNION REZONING PETITION TO C3 FRINGE COMMERCIAL DISTRICT BASE MED ON THE PROPOSED ZONING AND RECOMMEND COMMERCIAL LAND USE DESIGNATION. MOTION NUMBER TWO, THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION AFTER HEARING ALL INTERESTED PERSONS AND REVIEWING ALL RELEVANT INFORMATION FINDS THE PETITION SUBSTANTIALLY MEETS THE STANDARDS IN CHAPTER 55 ANN ARBOR UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE SECTION 5.29.5 SPECIAL EXEMPTION USE AND THEREFORE APPROVES THE MICHIGAN SCHOOLS CREDIT UNION SPECIAL EXEMPTION USE FOR MAXIMUM OF THREE DRIVE THRU LANES AS PART OF A FINANCIAL SERVICES USE. THE APPROVAL IS BASED ON THE FOLLOWING FINDINGS. NUMBER ONE, THE PROPOSED USE WILL BE CONSISTENT WITH THE C3 FRINGE COMMERCIAL DISTRICT ZONING DISTRICT, WHICH PROVIDES COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES, ACCESSED PRIMARILY BY AUTOMOBILE. TWO, THE PROPOSED USE WILL NOT ADVERSELY IMPACT TRAFFIC, PEDESTRIANS, BICYCLISTS, CIRCULATION OR ROAD INTERSECTION BASED ON THE LOCATION. WEST STADIUM BOULEVARD PROVIDES ACCESS TO THE SITE AND THE PROPOSED USE IS CONSISTENT WITH OTHER SURROUNDING USE TRAFFIC IMPACT. MOTION NUMBER THREE, THE THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION HEREBY APPROVES PROPOSED LANDSCAPE AND ACCORDING TO SECTION 50.30.3. B.7 TO REQUIRE ZERO SQUARE FOOT, SQUARE FEET OF BIORETENTION AREA DUE TO THE CONDITION OF CONTAMINATED ON SITE SOILS AND MOTION NUMBER NOWR THE ANN CITY PLANNING COMMISSION HEREBY RECOMMENDS THAT THE MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL APPROVE THE MICHIGAN SCHOOLS AND CREDIT UNION SITE PLAN. DOILY I HAVE A COMMISSIONER THAT WILL MOVE THAT? MOVED BY COMMISSIONER MILLS, SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER GILL GILL RANDALL AND WE ARE IN -- COMMISSIONER GIB RANDALL. AND COMMISSIONER GIB RANDALL?
00:27:47.641: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: PL ANS SHOWN BY RE RETENTION AND THEN BY THE STAFF REPORT AND WHAT YOU JUST READ SAID THERE'S NO BIOIF RETENTION. COULD YOU CLARIFY WHAT WE SEE?
00:27:58.319: >> COULD YOU ADDRESS THE PETITIONER PLEASE, I DON'T WANT TO GET IT WRONG DPIB GIB OKAY. SORRY.
00:28:05.926: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: OK AY. SORRY.
00:28:06.961: >> GOOD EVENING, ERIC WILLIAMS, STONEFIELD ENGINEERING AND DESIGN. SHELBY STREET, DETROIT. THE SITE WAS PREVIOUSLY A GAS STATION CARWASH FACILITIES, THERE WERE UNDERGROUND STORAGE TANKS THAT HAD PREVIOUSLY EXISTED AND SINCE REMOVED, THERE IS SOME ELEVATED GROUNDWATER LEVELS IN CERTAIN AREAS THAT WERE FOUND TO BE CONTAMINATED, SO THAT'S THE REASON FOR THE WAIVER. NOW, THE DETENTION POND THAT YOU'RE SEEING WE'VE WORKED WITH CITY STAFF TO ENSURE THAT IT'S GOING TO BE LINED WITH A PLASTIC LINER. THOSE LINERS ALLOW FOR SMALL PLANTINGS. WE WOULDN'T PUT ANY TREES ON THEM OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT THAT COULD POTENTIALLY HAVE DEEP ROOTS, AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT, THAT WILL ALLOW FOR EASY MAINTENANCE SHOULD A PROBLEM ARISE WHERE THE LINER IS PUNCTURED FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER, THEY CAN EASILY COME IN , REVIEW AND REPLACE -- REMOVE AND REPLACE WHATEVER NEEDS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF, AS OPPOSED TO HAVING AN UNDERGROUND RETENTION SYSTEM THAT YOU WOULD MORE TYPICALLY SEE. SO BIORETENTION ALLOWS FOR INFILTRATION, THE CITY CODE ALLOWS FOR OR THEY REQUIRE INFILTRATION TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR IN THIS CASE THERE'S 20 PERCENT INCREASE IN THE DETENTION REQUIREMENT, SO WE ARE PROVIDING THAT INCREASE BY NOT ALLOWING WATER TO INFILTRATE INTO THE SYSTEM.
00:29:22.436: >> HOW DEEP IS THE LINER? I'M JUST CURIOUS.
00:29:25.239: >> IT'S EITHER A 40 OR 60 ML PLASTIC. WE'RE WORKING WITH THE PARTICULAR SUPPLIER. I THINK THEY USUALLY PUT A 6 TO 8-INCH CAP ON TOP OF IT OF CLEAN SOIL AND THEN FROM THERE, YOU KNOW, WILL HAVE PERFORATED PIPING TO GET IT INTO THE OUTLET SYSTEM.
00:29:44.358: >> I'M JUST CURIOUS WHAT'S THE SECTION OF SOIL ON TOP OF YOUR LINER?
00:29:49.430: >> IT WILL BE LIKE 6 TO 8 INCHES IT'S NOT GOING TO BE A SIGNIFICANT CROSS-SECTION.
00:29:57.237: >> SO YOU'RE PLANTING PLANTS IN A 6 TO 8-INCH SOIL PROFILE?
00:30:04.778: >> SHE'S ASKING FOR THE CROSS-SECTION OF THE RETENTION POND.
00:30:07.948: >> SO WE'RE GOING TO WORK THROUGH THOSE PARTICULAR DETAILS WITH THE MANUFACTURER. WE'VE HAD DISCUSSIONS PRELIMINARILY WITH LOCAL MANUFACTURERS, AND IF THEY DEEM THAT WE CAN'T PUT ANY SORT OF SHRUBBERY OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT, WE WOULD OBVIOUSLY MAINTAIN IT IN THE MANNER NECESSARY TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS.
00:30:28.769: >> SO THEN THE PLAN THAT WE SEE IN FRONT OF US, THAT'S WHAT WE'RE -- IT'S BASICALLY ALL HERB ACIOUS IN TERMS OF WHAT'S PLANTED THERE.
00:30:40.814: >> CORRECT.
00:30:41.115: >> THERE'S NO SHRUBS. AND THEY'RE SITTING IN A SIX TO EIGHT INCH PROFILE ON TOP OF A LINER BASICALLY.
00:30:46.353: >> CORRECT. THE SOIL CROSS-SECTION I'M NOT 100 PERCENT SURE ON, WE WOULD DEFER TO THE MANUFACTURER. IF YOU WOULD LIKE, I COULD PROVIDE YOU THE SECTIONS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT BUT I JUST DON'T HAVE THEM OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD.
00:30:58.032: >> I GUESS WHAT I WOULD SAY, SO I DO THIS FOR A LIVING, SO I'M PROBABLY GOING TO PICK THIS APART A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN YOU WOULD BE USE TO DO FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS, BUT AS A PLANTING MEDIA, THAT IS REALLY THIN IN TERMS OF A PLANT SURVIVAL VIEF ING. -- IN TERMS OF A PLANT SURVIVING , SO YOU MAY JUST WANT TO WORK WITH STAFF TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS A VIABLE SECTION FOR SURVIVAL WITH YOUR NATURAL FEATURES PERSON BECAUSE THAT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE WE WOULD END UP WITH A BIORETENTION FULL OF GREEN THINGS, TO ME, IN TERMS OF SORT OF WHAT THE END GAME WOULD LOOK LIKE AND FUNCTION, AND SO BASICALLY YOU JUST HAVE A DETENTION SYSTEM THAT IS FILLING UP WITH WATER AND BLEEDING OUT THROUGH PERFORATED PIPE AT THE BOTTOM.
00:32:02.930: >> CORRECT.
00:32:04.631: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: SO I WOULD JUST THINK WHATEVER SPECIES YOU HAVE IN THERE, THINK LONG AND HARD ABOUT WHAT'S ACTUALLY GOING ON WORK GIVEN THE SOIL PROFILE THAT YOU HAVE. SO IT'S JUST NOT A SITUATION THAT MANY PLANTS ARE USED TO GROWING IN, IN THIS AREA, TO HAVE JUST KIND OF A CAP AT SUCH A SHORT, YOU KNOW, DISTANCE. YEAH. OKAY. SO I UNDERSTAND HOW IT'S FUNCTIONING NOW. THAT'S HELPFUL. BUTTER BUT, YOU KNOW, SHOULD THINGS GO FORWARD, I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT SHOULD PROBABLY BE REVIEWED A LITTLE MORE DEEPLY BECAUSE I THINK IF IT'S SIX INCHES OF SOIL, I THINK THE PLANTS JUST AREN'T GOING TO LIVE, AND IT'S GOING TO LOOK BAD , AND I DON'T THINK ANYBODY WANTS THAT, YOU KNOW.
00:32:50.677: >> I THINK AS STEVE MENTIONED, THEIR INTENT IS TO HAVE WELL CAPPED, WELL MAINTAINED SITES.
00:32:56.950: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: RI GHT.  SO LET'S SET THEM UP FOR SUCCESS BY HAVING ENOUGH OF THE SOIL PROFILE AND WHETHER THE LINER CAN BE DEEPER SO THERE CAN BE SOMETHING THAT HAS A CHANCE OF SURVIVAL I THINK WOULD BE IMPORTANT IF IT WERE TO MOVE FORWARD, TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT TECHNICAL PIECE IS GOING TO WORK OKAY. SO DID YOU EVER EXPLORE BROWNFIELD REMEDIATION AS PART OF THE PROJE OR NO?
00:33:22.376: >> WELL, WE HAVE THE DUE CARE PLAN AT THAT THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMPANY PROVIDED FOR US, AND THERE IS QUITE A BIT OF HISTORY WITH THE SITE, SO THE DUE CARE PLAN WAS THE WAY WE'RE KIND OF FOLLOWING THAT.
00:33:36.056: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: YO U'RE FOLLOWING WHAT THEY'RE SAYING?
00:33:37.691: >> YEAH, WE'RE FOLLOWING THE PLAN.
00:33:39.393: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: AL L RIGHT. THANK YOU.
00:33:40.627: >> Planning Manager: COMMISSIONE R MILLS?
00:33:45.933: >> Vice Chair Mills: I KNOW LAST TIME I WAS ONE OF THE PEOPLE THAT WAS REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE DRIVE THRU AND THE CRITERIA THAT WE HAD TO EVALUATE THE DRIVE THRU, WHICH WAS EFFECTIVELY SAFE MOVEMENTS OF PEDESTRIANS AND VEHICLES, AND I WANT TO APPLAUD YOU FOR TAKING WHAT WE SAID AND MAKING THIS WAY SAFER. I THINK THAT THE WAY THAT THE OUTLET FROM THE DRIVE THRU WORKS IS A LITTLE BIT MORE LOGICAL. IT'S KIND OF CLEAR WHAT TO DO IF I'M A PEDESTRIAN, LIKE WHERE I GO. I WAS GOING BACK AND FORTH IN MY MIND, LIKE IMAGINING WALKING THEN THROUGH YOUR SITE, BECAUSE AGAIN, MOSTLY I WOULD BE ON FOOT OR ON BIKE AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT, LIKE DO YOU REALLY NEED A SIDEWALK ALL ALONG THAT SOUTHERN BORDER? AND I THINK YOU KIND OF DO BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE MIGHT NOT -- THEY MIGHT BE NOT THERE TO USE THE AT -- OR IT MIGHT BE AFTER-HOURS, RIGHT? THEY'RE COMING FROM THE SHOPPING MALL AFTER-HOURS, SO THEY WANT TO USE THE ATM, SO THE BACK DOOR IS NOT OPEN, SO YOU KIND OF DO NEED -- I APPRECIATE THAT YOU ARE PROVIDING A PATH FOR THEM ON YOUR SITE. I THINK THAT'S REALLY HELPFUL. I REALLY APPRECIATE SHOWING WHERE THE CONNECTION POINTS WOULD BE IF SOMEDAY, AS I THINK OUR PLANS CALL FOR AND WHAT WE WOULD HOPE OTHER PROPERTY OWNERS GET ON BOARD WITH IS CONNECTING THE NEIGHBORING SITES, I THINK THAT'S REALLY, REALLY HELPFUL. I THANK YOU FOR PUTTING AN ATM ON THE FRONT. I THINK THAT AGAIN IS REALLY HELPFUL. I'M A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS THAT PEOPLE -- IT'S GOING TO BE YOUR MEMBERS THAT ARE USING IT, SO THE FIRST TIME AROUND THEY MIGHT WALK UP TO THE BACK ATM, AGAIN, DEPENDING ON WHERE THEY'RE COMING FROM, BUT MAYBE THEY'LL LEARN WHEN THEY WALK IN THROUGH THE DOOR. AND SOME OF THE SAME DMENTS THAT I HAD LAST TIME -- COMMENTS AT THAT I HAD LAST TIME, I APPRECIATE THAT THE PARKING SPACES ARE THE MOST CONVENIENT, SO KIND OF MINIMIZING, DOING DUAL PURPOSE WITH THE ASPHALT THAT YOU DO HAVE IN TERMS IS OF THE REQUIREMENT FOR THE TRASH PICKUP, KIND OF USING THE DRIVING PATH FOR THAT, I THINK THAT -- I HOPE THAT YOU ALSO FEEL THAT THIS IS AN IMPROVEMENT TO THE SITE PLAN, LIKE I KNOW THAT IT MUST BE NERVE WRACKING, RIGHT, TO HEAR A WHOLE BUNCH OF PEOPLE SAY, WELL, I WISH YOU WOULD HAVE DONE THAT, BUT I BELIEVE LOOKING AT THIS THAT THIS IS MUCH SAFER FOR PEDESTRIANS, AND SO THIS IS SOMETHING WHERE I APPRECIATE THE RESEARCH THAT YOU'VE DONE ON THE IMPACT THAT IT HAS ON OUR CARBON EMISSIONS. I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT. I DON'T DISPUTE -- I'M A RESEARCHER, I DON'T DISPUTE THE RESEARCH. I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, ON CORRIDORS LIKE THIS, I MEAN, THIS IS WHERE WE REALLY HOPE TO SEE MULTISTORY BUILDINGS. THAT'S NOT WHAT OUR CODE CALLS FOR, RIGHT? OUR CODE, I THINK, ALLOWS FOR THIS. WE HAVE DISCRETION TO MAKE SURE THAT ANY DRIVE THRUS CONFORM TO THOSE STANDARDS THAT WE SET FORTH IN OUR CODE, AND SO THIS MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO TAKE UP IN THE FUTURE IN TERMS OF WHAT'S APPLICABLE, BUT I FEEL LIKE THE CRITERIA THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW, THAT THIS MEETS IT. SO I PLAN TO SUPPORT THIS S I RECOGNIZE THAT IS THE PETITIONER WAS ASKING POTENTIALLY FOR A POSTPONEMENT, SO I DON'T WANT TO MOVE THAT RIGHT NOW, BUT BECAUSE I WAS ONE OF THE MORE OUTSPOKEN PEOPLE LAST TIME, I JUST THOUGHT I WOULD PUT IT OUT THERE THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I DO PLAN TO SUPPORT.
00:37:32.692: >> Planning Manager: ALL RIGHT. MR. LENART?
00:37:35.862: >> I JUST WANTED TO DO A QUICK HOUSEKEEPING NOTE THAT IN REVIEW ING IT, WAS MADE AWARE THAT THE -- A PAST SITE PLAN WAS INCLUDED IN A LINK TO THE STAFF REPORT AND ATTACHMENT, SO THE STAFF REPORT REFLECTS THE CHANGES, THE PRESENTATION FROM THE PETITIONER IS ACCURATELY REFLECTING THE CHANGES, AND I HAVE PROVIDED YOU AN UPDATED THRING ON THE MOST CURRENT STAFF REPORT, MY APOLOGIES FOR THAT AM
00:38:02.255: >> Planning Manager: COMMISSIONE R IS IT ABRAMS.
00:38:04.825: >> I APOLOGIZE, I MISSED THE DECEMBER 3 MEETING, I WAS AN STHEANLT DAY, SO I'VE BEEN TRYING TO CATCH UP ON THE BACK AND FORTH AND MAYBE JUST ANECDOTALLY WHEN I SAW THE PREVIOUS PLAN WHICH I THOUGHT WAS THE UPDATED PLAN, THIS PLAN IS SO MUCH BETTER. SO I'M INCREDIBLY ENCOURAGED BY THAT. I HAD ONE QUESTION ABOUT THE PARKING. SO I NOTICED THAT THE MINIMUM PARKING IS 18 SPOTS, THE MAXIMUM IS 21, AND YOU'VE CHOSEN TOPPED THE MAXIMUM AND GIVEN THAT THERE WAS A CONCERN ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF ASPHALT I WONDERED IF YOU COULD SPEAK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT DECISION.
00:38:43.997: >> I COULD TRY ON ANSWER IT, IF I NEED TO DO I COULD DEFER TO THE CREDIT UNION. THE NUMBER OF STAFF THABLED AT THIS BRANCH, THERE'S THREE OFFICES, THERE'S THREE WHAT THEY CALL MEMBER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVES, THOSE ARE MSR'S AND THERE'S THREE TELLERS, YOU WALK UP TO A COUNTER, SO THAT'S UP TO NINE PEOPLE WOULD BE AT THIS BRANCH. BECAUSE THIS BRANCH IS FARTHER AWAY FROM THEIR HEADQUARTERS, THEY'LL BE DOING MORTGAGE CLOSINGS AND CLOSE PGZ AT THIS BRANCH, SO YOU'LL HAVE POTENTIALLY BUYER, SELLER, REAL ESTATE PEOPLE DOING A CLOSE BEING HERE AT TIMES FOR HOME MORTGAGES AND SUCH. SO WITH THE NINE AND WE WENT WITH THE MAXIMUM BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO GIVE UP EIGHT TO NINE FOR THAT, THAT WILL LEAVE US ELEVEN, NO, TEN TO WORK WITH, TEN, ELEVEN TO WORK WITH ON A DAILY BASIS, YOU GET THREE OR FOUR MEMBERS, NOW YOU'RE DOWN TO THREE OR FOUR SPACES, A COUPLE OF THOSE ARE HANDICAPPED, SO, YOU KNOW, WE NEED ENOUGH FOR OBVIOUSLY THE EMPLOYEES, THE MEMBERS, THE TEAM MEMBERS TO PARK, AND THAT'S WHY THEY'LL BE IN THE BACK HALF OF THE SITE AND THEN LEAVE THE FRONT FOR THE MEMBERS TO OCCUPY. SO THAT'S REASON WE WENT WITH THE HIGHER NUMBER JUST BECAUSE THERE'S GOING TO BE CLOSINGS HERE ON LOTS OF OTHER KINDS OF, YOU KNOW, FINANCIAL TIEF LOANS AND SUCH, SO YOU COULD HAVE AN INFLUX AT TIMES. MAYBE PEOPLE WILL COME FROM THE ADJACENT PARKING LOTS TOO, WHICH IS POTENTIALLY POSSIBLE, BUT WE'VE GOT TO SUPPORT THIS TEAM.
00:40:06.713: >> YOU CAN'T DESIGN FOR THAT, I UNDERSTAND.
00:40:08.748: >> WE'RE NOT DESIGNING FOR THAT.
00:40:10.150: >> I UNDERSTAND THAT. IT SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF PARKING FOR A CREDIT UNION, BUT OKAY. THANKS.
00:40:16.423: >> YOU'RE WELCOME.
00:40:22.062: >>>
00:40:23.029: >> Planning Manager: FURTHER DISCUSSION? I DID HAVE A QUESTION IN REGARDS TO THE SPECIAL EXEMPTION USE. MR. LEONARD, HOW DO WE -- MR. APPROXIMATE APPROXIMATE LENART HOW DO WE TIE THAT INTO THIS SITE PLAN IS IT I KNOW WE'VE HAD SOME CONVERSATIONS IN THE PAST ABOUT SPECIAL EXEMPTION USES FOR DRIVE THRUS THAT WERE PUT IN AND THEN ULTIMATELY IT WASN'T TIED TO THE EXACT SITE PLAN, IT CAME BACK WITH ANOTHER SITE PLAN. IS THERE A WAY WE CAN TIE THAT THIS SPECIAL EXEMPTION USE IS TIED TO THE SITE PLAN APPROVAL?
00:40:58.598: >> ABSOLUTELY. THE ORDINANCE PROVIDES YOU CAN ADD CONDITIONS TO ANY SPECIAL EXEMPTION USE YOU GRANT. IF SO DESIRED YOU COULD ADD A CONDITION THAT THIS SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE BE GRANTED AND REFERENCE THIS SPECIFIC SITE PLAN. I WOULD SAY THAT -- YEAH, I WOULD SIMPLY ADD THE CONDITION THAT IT IS BASED ON THE FUNCTIONALITY AND ANTICIPATED OPERATION AND IMPACT TO THE SITE NEIGHBORING PROPERTIES AS REPRESENTED ON THAT SPECIFIC SITE PLAN.
00:41:30.730: >> CAN I MOVE THAT?
00:41:32.032: >> I THINK YOU JUST DID.
00:41:34.434: >> SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER MILLS. ANY DISCUSSION ON THAT AMENDMENT ALL RIGHT. ALL THOSE IN FAVOR ON THAT AMENDMENT, PLEEPS SAY A -- PLEASE SAY AYE.
00:41:48.915: >> [CHORUS OF AYES]
00:41:52.285: >> Planning Manager: OPPOSED? WE'RE BACK TO THE FOUR MOTIONS WITH ONE OF THEM BEING AMENDED. FURTHER DISCUSSION? COMMISSIONER SAUVE.
00:41:59.626: >> Commissioner Sauve: THANK YOU FOR THE REDESIGN, I THINK IT SAYS A LOT TO THE EXPERTISE ON THIS BOARD AND THE RECEPTION OF THE TEAM IN TERMS EEF VAULTING FOR IT AND PUSHING FOR A STRONGER DESIGN, THE DEFAULT DESIGN MAY NOT BE THE BEST AND WE CAN DO A LITTLE BIT BETTER, SO I APPRECIATE THAT BECAUSE DEPENDING ON HOW THE CONVERSATION WENT LAST TIME, WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN STUCK WITH A MEDIOCRE SITE PLAN FOR SEVERAL YEARS, AND I THINK THAT'S PART OF MY POSITION ON THIS ONE, I GO BACK AND FORTH ABOUT THE DRIVE THRU, BUT FRANKLY, I AM NOT INTERESTED IN THE TENANT SO MUCH BECAUSE THIS BUILDING CAN LIVE BEYOND WHATEVER TENANT EXISTS IN IT, SO WE NEED TO CONSIDER WHAT THIS DOES TO THE FABRIC OF THE CORRIDOR. SO THAT'S WHERE I'M TRYING TO EVALUATE THIS PROPERTY IN TERMS OF WHAT WE'RE APPROVING IS, YOU KNOW, HIGHEST BES USE BUT STILL MATCHES OUR ORDINANCE AND WHAT FALLS WITHIN OUR GUIDELINES. WE DO HAVE OUR MASTER PLANNING ORDINANCE AND SUSTAINABILITY MISSION LIKE ARE IN THERE, SO WHEN WE DO TALK ABOUT DRIVE THRU S, IT IS WITHIN OUR MASTER PLAN GUIDELINES, SO WITH DUE DILIGENCE OF READING ALL OF THOSE DOCUMENTS, YOU WOULD DISCOVER THAT, AND WE KNOW THAT SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE IS IN THE ORDINANCE, SO THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED, THIS SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A SURPRISE FROM THE LAST TIME AROUND. SO I THINK IT HIGHLIGHTS A LOT FROM OUR SIDE IN TERMS OF US BEING DILIGENT AND HOLDING ACCOUNTABILITY AND PUSHING THOSE CONVERSATIONS FARD, SO -- FORWARD, SO THIS IS A PRECEDENT TO KEEP THAT CONVERSATION FORWARD I THINK IS IMPORTANT, I THINK IT CEEMS THE PROFESSIONAL MS ON THE OTHER SIDE AS ACCOUNTABLE TO ACTUALLY DO THEIR DUE DILIGENCE AND PREPARE AND PUSH THE BEST WORK FORWARD. SO I DO THINK THAT THIS IS A MUCH BETTER FIT IN THE SITE PLAN AND HOW IT CONNECTS TO THE OTHER FABRIC. SO I DON'T LIKE THE DRIVE THRUS, BUT WE HAVE THREE OTHER BANKS LIKE ON THAT BLOCK WITH DRIVE THRUS. I GET THAT THAT IS THE CURRENT FABRIC, AND THERE'S A LOT OF MOVING PARTS AND MAYBE THOSE THREE BANKS GO AWAY IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS OR SOMETHING AND THIS SOMEONE THE LAST ONE LEFT, BUT AS THIS CITY EVOLVES, YOU KNOW, I IMAGINE THAT THIS SITE MIGHT EVOLVE DIFFERENTLY TOO, AND WHILE IT'S SET UP AS A DRIVE THRU NOW, THERE ARE ALSO EXISTING BUILDINGS ALONG THAT CORRIDOR THAT USED TO HAVE DRIVE THRUS THAT THE BUILDINGS REMAIN THE DRIVE THRUS, SO THE EMISSIONS OF IT, IT JUST IS IF THE TENANT ENABLES THEM TO WORK OR NOT. SO I SUPPORT IT THROUGH THAT RATIONALE.
00:44:48.695: >> Planning Manager: MR. LENART?
00:44:49.362: >> SOMETHING YOU TALKED ABOUT ABOUT THE EVOLUTION OF THIS, AND JILL, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO WEIGH IN ON THIS TOO, BUT THIS SPECIAL USE NOW THAT WE'VE TIED INTO THE STIET PLAN IS VERY SPECIFIC TO THIS GEOMETRY, IT'S ALSO SPECIFIC TO FINANCIAL SERVICES USE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT -- IF TO THAT INTENTION OF FLEXIBILITY IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN AS A COMMISSION LINK IT GO TO BOTH FINANCIAL SERVICES AND THIS PHYSICAL CONFIGURATION OR YOU'RE LESS CONCERNED ABOUT THE USE BASE BUT MORE ABOUT THE PHYSICAL CONFIGURATION OF IT.
00:45:24.163: >> Commissioner Sauve: PERSONALL Y, I WOULD BE OPEN TO KEEPING IT TETHERED TO FINANCIAL BECAUSE WE DID SEE REPORTS THAT FOOD DRIVE THRUS ACTUALLY DO MORE EMISSIONS IMPACT, SO TETHERING IT THAT WAY MEANS ADAPTIVE REUSE IF IT'S FOOD BASED WOULD REMOVE --
00:45:37.977: >> IT WOULD HAVE TO COME BACK IN FINANCIAL.
00:45:41.247: >> Commissioner Sauve: YES.
00:45:41.848: >> OKAY, I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR
00:45:43.816: >> AND PART OF THE OTHER REASON WHY I WANTED TO TIE IT TO THE SITE PLAN IS I DON'T WANT THE DRIVE THRU MOVING TO THE FRONT OF THE BUILDING DOWN THE ROAD WITH ANOTHER SITE PLAN. SH FURTHER -- COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT.
00:46:00.233: >> I ALSO MISSED THE PREVIOUS MEETING WHERE YOU GUYS PRESENTED THE INITIAL SITE PLAN, SO I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT. I'LL JUST SORT OF ECHO WHAT SOME OF MY FELLOW COMMISSIONERS SAID. I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT THERE IS A WALKUP ATM, I WISH MY BANK HAD THAT. ALSO I LIKE SEEING THE ORIENTATION WHERE IT'S CLOSER TO THE STREET SO IT'S NOT JUST SEPARATED BY A SEA OF PARKING. I GUESS ONE QUESTION, IS THERE A REASON WHY YOU NEED THREE LANES IN THE DRIVE-THRU?
00:46:33.499: >> WELL, THE REASON BEHIND THAT, THE FIRST LANE IS AN ATM LANE.
00:46:37.236: >> SOLELY ATM.
00:46:38.338: >> SO THEANTS AN INTERACTION LANE.
00:46:40.540: >> OKAY.
00:46:40.840: >> THEN WE HAVE THE OTHER TWO. SO PART OF IT IS IF ONE BREAKS DOWN, WE STILL HAVE ONE OPERATING, AND THEY DO BREAK DOWN, IT'S LIKE ANY MECHANICAL TYPE FUNCTION. AND ALSO IF YOU HAVE ONE LANE AND YOU HAVE MORE CARS STACKED, MORE TIME WAITING, SO WE THOUGHT IF YOU GET TWO LANES AND AT THE LAST MEETING STEVE BREWER HAD MENTIONED BECAUSE OF THEIR MEMBER MAKEUP AND THE OTHER BRANCHES, THIS WOULD BE NUMBER 16 FOR THEM, THEY DO HAVE A PERSON THAT'S ALLOCATED TO THE DRIVE THRU FUNCTION, SO IT'S A FASTER TRANSACTION, MEMBERS AREN'T WAITING, THEY WANT TO SERVICE THEM AS EFFICIENTLY AS THEY CAN. SO THAT'S THE THINKING BEHIND THE TWO LANES.
00:47:14.974: >> AND I EXPECT THAT AT OTHER BRANCHES YOU WOULD ACTUALLY HAVE DATA. I GUESS I'M JUST ASKING BECAUSE THE BANK THAT I GO TO, I DO USE THE DRIVEUP ATM BECAUSE THERE IS NOT A WALKUP ATN, BUT I NEVER SEE ANYBODY ELSE AT THE DRIVE- THRU.
00:47:31.057: >> AS WAS POINTED OUT LAST TIME, THEIR MEMBERS WANT ALL FUNCTION, THEY WANT ATM, THEY WANT TO COME IN THE BRANCH, THEY WANT DRIVE THRU FUNCTION, THEY WANT ONLINE, SO THEY'RE LOOKING FOR ALL OF THOSE OPTIONS AND THE CLIENTELE IS VARIED, SO EVERYBODY KIND OF PICKS WHAT THEY LIKE TO USE.
00:47:47.940: >> YEAH.
00:47:48.341: >> SO THAT'S PART OF THE REASON.
00:47:49.675: >> WE DO APPROXIMATELY 5,000S A MONTH IN THE DRIVE THRU.
00:47:54.680: >> WOW.
00:47:55.081: >> ANYWHERE FROM 4,000 TO 6,000 A MONTH IN THE ATM.
00:47:59.786: >> GREAT.  OKAY. THANK YOU.
00:48:01.521: >> YOU'RE WELCOME.
00:48:05.792: >> SO I APPRECIATE AWFUL THE CHANGES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE. I -- I APPRECIATE ALL THE CHANGES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE. I THINK YOU TOOK OUR FEEDBACK AND DID GREAT THINGS WITH IT, SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT. WITH REGARDS TO THE DRIVE THRUS, I AM GOING TO SUPPORT THIS SITE PLAN AND WHAT WE HAVE BEFORE US THIS EVENING, BUT I GUESS THIS IS MOFER A, YOU KNOW -- MORE OF A, YOU KNOW, CAUTIONARY TALE TO THE DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY THAT THAT MIGHT NOT BE THE CASE FORECLOSURE. THIS COMMISSION MAY NOT APPROVE DRIVE THRUS IN THE FUTURE, AND IT'S AT A PURVIEW BECAUSE THIS IS A SPECIAL EXEMPTION USE. SO WITH THAT, IS THERE ANY OTHER DISCUSSION? COMMISSIONER MILLS?
00:48:48.801: >> Vice Chair Mills: I'M JUST WONDERING, ASKING THE PETITIONER IF YOU WOULD LIKE ME TO MOVE POSTPONEMENT OR IF YOU WOULD LIKE US TO PROCEED VOTING TONIGHT? [LAUGHTER] ALL RIGHT.
00:49:03.216: >> ALL RIGHT.
00:49:04.517: >> SEEING NO FURTHER DISCUSSION, ALL THOSE IN FAVOR, PLEASE SAY A YE. [CHORUS OF AYES]
00:49:09.155: >> OPPOSED? WE ARE APPROVED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
00:49:11.557: >> THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. WE NOW MOVE ON TO OUR REGULAR BUSINESS AND BEFORE US THIS SEEFNG THE FISCAL YEAR 2021 THROUGH 2026 CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS PLANS CIP FOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION APPROVAL AND THIS EVENING WE HAVE A REPORT FROM MISS GOSLIN.
00:49:30.476: >> SORRY, I JUST WANTED TO SAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR CONSIDERING OUR REVISIONLESS IN THE PLAN. WE REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO BEING PART OF YOUR COMMUNITY, AND MISS HAMMERSCHMIDT, IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE A MEMBER, WE DO HAVE THE SERVICES THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR [LAUGHTER]
00:49:44.090: >> THANK YOU.
00:49:44.824: >> THANKS AGAIN.
00:49:45.691: >> THANK YOU. MISS GOSLIN, WELCOME BACK.
00:49:55.234: >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I PROMISE NOT TO DO TOO MANY BELLS AND WHISTLES. SO I BASICALLY TONIGHT JUST WANT TO HIT SOME OF THE HIGHLIGHTS. WE DID HAVE THE WORK SESSION IN DECEMBER WHICH MOST BUT NOT ALL OF YOU WERE ABLE TO ATTEND, AND OF COURSE IT'S A PUBLIC HEARING SO I WANT TO KIND OF HIT THE HIGHLIGHTS OF WHAT WE'RE DOING ALSO IN CASE THERE'S ANYONE HERE FOR THE PUBLIC HEARING. SO WHAT WE'RE HERE FOR TONIGHT IS LOOKING FOR A RESOLUTION OF APPROVAL FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2021 TO 2026 CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS PLAN. IN EFFECT, WHAT WE'RE DOING IS LOOKING AT CHANGES TO THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF THAT PLAN. BUT YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO APPROVE A SIX-YEAR PLAN AT A TIME. SO WHEN WE HIT THESE ODD NUMBER YEARS, WHAT WE'RE DOING IS KEEPING THE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PLAN IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE CAPITAL BUDGET. SO IN MAY, CITY COUNCIL WILL BE APPROVAL PROVING THE 2021 BUDGET SO IF WE NEEDED CHANGES TO THE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PLAN, THAT'S WHERE WE INSERT THEM IS IN THIS MODIFICATION PLAN. SO THE THINGS AWE INCORPORATE INTO THE PLAN ARE CHANGES IN BUDGET AUTO,, CHANGES IN SCHEDULE, SOMETIMES A COMBINATION OF THE TWO, AND THEN THERE WILL ALWAYS BE A FEW CHANGES THAT ARE ADDED OR DELETED, USUALLY UNTIL RESPONSE TO SOMETHING TOTALLY UNEXPECTED IN THE NATURE OF A CAPITAL MAINTENANCE SORT OF PROJECT. SO WITHIN THE PLAN ITSELF THAT YOU HAVE, I WENT VERY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL LEVEL AND USED COLOR SO YOU COULD SEE WHICH KIND OF CHANGE WAS BEING PROPOSED, AND I THINK THAT JUST HELPS IN TERMS OF NEVADA DWAITION -- IN TERMS OF NAVIGATION. SO AFTER ALL THE CHANGES THAT WERE MADE, THE ORIGINAL FUNDING FOR FISCAL 2021 WAS A LITTLE OVER 77 MILLION, IT'S NOW 116, WHICH IS QUITE A DIFFERENCE AND I'LL HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT DROVE THAT. SO PART OF IT WAS SIMPLY DELAYED OF FISCAL 2020 PROJECTS INTO 2021 SO IT'S NOT REALLY THAT MUCH ADDITIONAL MONEY, BUT WE HAVE SEVERAL PROJECTS THAT WENT TO BID AND THEY CAME IN TOO HIGH AND WE DECIDED NOT TO AWARD THEM AND TO KIND OF GO THROUGH THE CYCLE TWICE. WE ALSO ARE MAKING A TECHNICAL CHANGE WHEN WE LINE SANITARY SEWERS, THE BIG ONES, WE HAD BEEN USING A STYRENE PRODUCT IN THEM. IT'S VERY -- OF THE ODOR IS VERY UNPLEASANT, THERE WERE A LOT OF COMPLAINTS, AND ALSO IN TERMS OF STORM SEWER LININGS, WE DECIDED WE'RE JUST DONE WITH IT BECAUSE ULTIMATELY IT COULD END UP IN THE RIVER, BUT WE DECIDE TO DO ALSO MAKE THAT CHANGE FOR SANITARY. AND AT THIS POINT IT'S QUITE A BIT MORE EXPENSIVE. HOWEVER, WE FEEL ENVIRONMENTALLY THAT'S JUSTIFIED, AND WE HAD A COUPLE OF BIG LINING PROJECTS IN '21. SO THAT WAS ONE OF THE INCREASE. ALSO THE ALAN CREEK BERM OPENING PROJECT THAT WE'RE VERY EXCITED WE'LL BE STARTING HERE SHORTLY, MANY OF YOU KNOW HAS TWO TUNNELS UNDER THE RAILROAD KIND OF BEHIND NORTH MAIN, ONE FOR PEDESTRIANS, ONE TO CARRY STORMWATER, TOOK A LOT OF TIME TO GET TO POINT, VERY UNUSUAL PROJECT FOR A CONTRACTOR TO BID, SO IT CAME IN PRETTY PRICEY AND THAT WAS PART OF THE INCREASE. WE HAD SOME THINGS HAPPEN AT THE WATER PLANT THAT REQUIRED IMMEDIATE ATTENTION. ON KIND OF THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THINGS GOING UP, THE DDA IS DOING ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT IN THE DOWNTOWN KIND OF ACCELERATED SOME OF THEIR STREETESCAPE PROJECTS, SO THAT'S GOOD NEWS KIND OF EXTRA, AND SIMILARLY IN THE STREET SYSTEM, COUNCIL HAD ALLOWED USE OF SOME FUND BALANCE TO HELP CATCH UP WITH OUR STREETLIGHT CONDITION, WE ALSO GOT A LITTLE MORE AT 51 MONEY THAN ANTICIPATED, SO THOSE ARE THE BASIC REASONS FOR THINGS THAT INCREASED. SO JUST QUICKLY NET, WE HAD 37 PROJECTS WITH FUNDING ADJUSTMENTS, 36 WITH SCHEDULE ADJUSTMENTS, 28 THAT HAD BOTH, AND THEN 14 PROJECTS THAT WERE ACTUALLY ADDED. AND AS FAR AS THE TYPE OF ASSETS THAT HAD THE MOST NUMBER OF CHANGES, THE WATER SYSTEM WAS THE NUMBER ONE WITH CHANGES FOLLOWED BY SEWER, SO WE'RE SEEING LOTS OF FUNDING SHIFTS IN THE UTILITY PRICING WE ARE GETTING. CONTRACTORS ARE NOT HUNGRY, SO THE PRICES HAVE BEEN GOING UP WAY MORE SO THAN LIKE STREETS OR PARKS OR SOME OF THE OTHER ASSET GROUPS. SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE HIGHLIGHTS OF THE CHANGE. I APOLOGIZE FOR MY FROGGY VOICE, I'M AT THE END OF THAT HORRIBLE RESPIRATORY THING THAT'S GOING AROUND. YOU DO ALSO HAVE JUST A SIMPLE LISTING OF THINGS THAT ARE CHANGED, SO IF YOU PREFER TABLES TO COLORED IN THINGS RS YOU'VE GOT BOTH TO LOOK AT. BUT WITH THAT, THAT'S BASICALLY THE GIST OF WHAT WE'RE DOING, SO I'LL BE ABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE OR ANY THAT ARISE FROM THE PUBLIC HEARING WHERE YOU MIGHT WANT MY ASSISTANCE IN ANSWERING. THANK YOU.
00:55:21.327: >> PERFECT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. [APPLAUSE]
00:55:24.830: >> AT THIS TIME I WOULD LIKE TO OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING TO THE CIP, IF THERE'S ANYONE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION, PLEASE STEP UP TO THE PODIUM, STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS FOR THE RECORD AND YOU'LL HAVE UP TO THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION. SEEING NO ONE, I WILL CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING, AND IS THERE A MOTION? THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. THE MOTION READS AS FOLLOWS, WHEREAS SECTION 1:  185 OF THE ANN ARBOR CITY CODE REQUIRES THAT THE CITY PLANNING COMMISSION ANNUALLY PREPARE A CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS PROGRAM FOR THE ENSUING SIX FISCAL YEARS, WHEREAS THE FISCAL YEAR 2020 THROUGH 2025 CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS PLAN CIP WAS APPROVED BY THE ANN ARBOR PLANNING COMMISSION ON JANUARY 15, 2019, AS A SUPPORTING DOCUMENT FOR THE CITY 'S MASTER PLAN AND, WHEREAS, THE FISCAL YEAR 2020 THROUGH 2025 CIP WAS APPROVED WITH MINOR ADJUSTMENTS BY THE ANN ARBOR CITY COUNCIL ON MAY 20, 2019 AS A BASIS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2020 CAPITAL BUDGET, WHEREAS THE SECOND YEAR OF THE FISCAL YEAR 2020 THROUGH 2025 CIP HAS BEEN ADJUSTED BASED ON CURRENT CONDITIONS AS RELATED TO THE ADJUSTED FISCAL YEAR 2021 CAPITAL BUDGET TO BE CONSIDERED BY THE CITY COUNCIL, AND WHEREAS A DUAL NOTICED PUBLIC HEARING WAS HELD BY THE CITY PLANNING COMMISSION ON JANUARY 20, 202020 , RESOLVE THE CITY PLANNING COMMISSION HEREBY RECOMMENDS -- HEREBY APPROVES, STORY SH THE FISCAL YEAR 2021 THROUGH 20816 CIP AS A SUPPORTING DOCUMENT FOR THE CITY 'S MASTER PLAN, MOVED BY COMMISSIONER MILLS, SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER SAUVE. DO WE HAVE DISCUSSION? COMMISSIONER SAUVE?
00:57:31.790: >> Commissioner Sauve: ON THAT MOTION, SHUPPED THE PUBLIC HEARING BE DATED JANUARY 22?
00:57:37.062: >> THANK YOU, I JUST NOTICED THAT.
00:57:40.265: >> WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE THAT MEVMENT?
00:57:41.900: >> MOVED? I MOVE TO ADJUST THE DATE TO TODAY'S DATE.
00:57:44.670: >> IS THAT A FRIENDLY -- OKAY. THANK YOU. FURTHER DISCUSSION? SEEING -- COMMISSIONER HAMMER SCHMIDT?
00:57:58.283: >> JUST A CLARIFICATION, I THINK TIN THE ANSWER TO THIS. ALL THE FUNDING ADJUSTMENT, THOSE ARE ALL HIGHER, RIGHT, NONE OF THEM IN HERE HAVE BEEN DECREASED, THEY'RE ALL ADJUSTMENTS UP?
00:58:07.126: >> THERE ACTUALLY ARE A COUPLE THAT WENT DOWN, AND WHAT I TRIED TO ON THE PRINTOUT LIKE THIS, THERE'S A COUPLE THAT WENT DOWN, BUT THAT WAS PRETTY RARE.
00:58:14.733: >> OKAY. YEAH.
00:58:20.606: >> COMMISSIONER MILLS.
00:58:22.608: >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT THIS AT OUR WORK SESSION, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE NOTED IS THAT THE CITY'S CARBON NEUTRALITY COMMISSION, THERE'S A WHOLE LOT OF PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THIS, INCLUDING MYSELF AND COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL, WHO ARE RIGHT NOW WORKING FURIOUSLY TO COME UP WITH A PRIORITIZED LIST OF PROJECTS THAT ARE TO BE DELIVERED TO CITY COUNCIL BY THE END OF MARCH IN TIME FOR BUDGET ING THAT ARE NOWHERE YET IN THIS PLAN, AND I'M ON THE ENERGY TASK FORCE WITHIN THIS, AND I CAN TELL YOU RIGHT NOW WE HAVE 36 DIFFERENT ENERGY PROPOSALS IN THERE. SOME OF THEM ARE NOT CAPITAL PROJECTS, BUT THERE ARE AT LEAST A FEW THAT WOULD BE CAPITAL PROJECTS OR THAT WOULD LIKELY INVOLVE A PRETTY BIG ENGINEERING STUDY SIMILAR PERHAPS TO WHAT IS BEING CONDUCTED RIGHT NOW FOR THE LANDFILL OR THAT WAS APPROVED TO BE CONDUCTED FOR THE LANDFILL. SO CAN YOU TALK US THROUGH -- I KNOW THAT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU WERE GOING TO POTENTIALLY LOCK AMOUNT IS HOW WE HANDLE THAT. I'VE GOT A WHEREAS CLAUSE THAT I COULD AMEND IN, BUT I'M JUST CURIOUS WHAT WE SHOULD DO TO SEND -- BECAUSE THIS IS A RECOMMENDATION TO COUNCIL ABOUT HOW THEY SHOULD ALLOCATE THE BUDGET AND I THINK IT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL TO LET THEM KNOW, HEY , THIS IS NOTES -- WELL, I WOULD SAY FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I WOULD WANT THE 20 -- WHATEVER YEAR WE'RE IN -- THE 202 IS BUDGET TO REFLECT THINGS WE NEED TODD IN THE NEXT DECADE WHETHER THERE ARE IMMEDIATE ACTIONS WE NEED TO TAKE. THAT'S LONG. HOW DO WE HANDLE THIS?
01:00:15.387: >> WELL, WITHOUT KNOWING THE SPECIFICS, I'M GOING ON GIVE KIND OF A GENERAL ANSWER BUT I THINK IT WILL STILL PRETTY MUCH ADDRESS TSM AS YOU SAID, THOSE THINGS THAT CAME OUT OF OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE TYPE OF BUDGET WHICH I SUSPECT A FAIR NUMBER OF THEML STILL HAVE TO BE DISCUSSED BUT THEY'LL BE NOT PART OF THE CAPITALS BUDGET AND THEREFORE NOT PART OF CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PLAN. THOSE THAT ARE CAPITAL IN NATURE , DEPENDING ON WHAT THE FUNDING SOURCE IS, IF THEY ARE GENERAL FUND ASKS, THAT WOULD NOT BE UNR UNUSUAL BECAUSE EVEN LIKE THE ADD MEN STRAIGHTER OR THE -- THE ADMINISTRATOR OR FINANCIAL PEOPLE CAN HAVE CAPITAL ASKS THAT ARE GENERAL FUNDED BECAUSE THEY DON'T COME THROUGH THE SAME KIND OF PRIORITIZATIONS. IF THEY WERE UTILITY RELATED, THEN THE MECHANISM WE COULD USE IF THERE WERE SOMETHING THAT REALLY HAS TO GO FORWARD, WE DO HAVE WHAT'S CALLED THE CPAN GROUP, WHICH IS LIKE THE OVER SIGHT GROUP FOR THE CIP, SO IF THIS IS PASSED TONIGHT AND THERE'S SOME WATER NEED ON YOUR LIST THAT YOU REALLY WANT TO PUSH FORWARD, THEN WE COULD POTENTIALLY IN THE CPAN GROUP SAY WHAT WOULD WE MOVE OUT BECAUSE THE UTILITIES ARE REALLY SPHUNLDED AS A -- FUNDED AS A BUCKET OF MONEY EQUAL TO THAT AMOUNT AND ASSUMING THOSE PROJECTS ARE IN IT, BUT WE CAN HAVE SOME FLEXIBILITY. GENERALLY THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN A LOT, BUT IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE I THINK WE COULD MAKE IT WORK THROUGH THAT MECHANISM. AS I SAID, THE GENERAL FUNDED PROJECTS ULTIMATELY FINANCE ADMINISTRATION KIND OF MAKE THE CALLS BECAUSE IT'S THE ADMINISTRATOR'S BUDGET'S PUT FORWARD. SO I BELIEVE WE CAN WORK THROUGH T BUT THE SOONER I WOULD KNOW WHAT SOME OF THOSE ARE THAT ARE CAPITAL, THE MORE SPECIFIC I COULD PROBABLY COME UP WITH THE BEST MECHANISM TO ACHIEVE IT. AND SOMETHING IN HERE HAD TO WAIT, WE COULD MAKE THE ADJUSTMENT ON THAT CPAN LEVEL BECAUSE THAT DOES HAPPEN LIKE WHEN PROJECTS COME IN TOO HIGH, EVEN AFTER THEY'RE APPROVED, EVEN AFTER BUDGET, SOMETHING HAS TO GET MOVED AROUND A LITTLE BIT WE TRY KEEP THAT TO A MINIMUM, BUT IT DOES HAPPEN.
01:02:30.822: >> OKAY. YEAH. SO AGAIN, BECAUSE THE CITY DECLARED THE CLIMATE EMERGENCY, RIGHT, AND WE'RE TREATING IT LIKE AN EMERGENCY OR TRYING TO, PULLING THINGS TOGETHER, LIKE IT'S FAST AND FURIOUS. SO I MEAN, I KNOW THAT OUR GROUP HAS A LIST OF THINGS I THINK THAT YOUR GROUP DOES TOO. SO SNF THOSE PROJECTS MAY BE KNOWN, SO I THINK -- SO SOME OF THOSE PROJECTS MAY BE KNOWN, SO I THINK IT'S NOW OR AT LEAST THAT THEY'RE UNDER CONSIDERATION WHETHER THEY MAKE IT INTO THE FINAL PLAN IS YET TO BE SEEN, RIGHT, THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROCESS. BUT BECAUSE WE'RE SEEING THIS NOW AND NOT THREE MONTHS FROM NOW WHEN THAT PLAN IS KNOWN, RIGHT, WE CAN'T DO IT.
01:03:11.296: >> SO ONE OTHER THING I FORGOT TO SAY ALSO, THIS FALL, EVEN THOUGH IT WILL BE A FULL YEAR, WE STILL MODIFY EXISTING YEARS IF WE NEED TO. SO I'M THINKING THERE'S PROBABLY NOT GOING TO BE A LOT OF THINGS THAT YOU ACTUALLY ARE GOING TO COMMIT TO FOR FISCAL '21 BY BUDGET TIME. SO ANY OF THE OTHERS THAT YOU KNOW YOU WANT SOON BUT MAYBE THEY'RE '21, MAYBE THEY'RE '22, WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY AGAIN IN JUST A FEW MORE MONTHS WHEN WE START THE MODIFICATION OR THE FULL BLOWN NEXT PLAN THAT WE COULD ULTIMATELY STILL MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO '21 THERE AGAIN, IT SEEMS A LITTLE WEIRD, IT'S HARDER, BECAUSE THEN WE HAVE TO SACRIFICE SOMETHING TO MAKE WAY, OTHERWISE, YOU KNOW, IT COULD GO TO AN EIGHT VOTE THING, WHICH ISN'T IMPOSSIBLE IN COUNCIL, BUT THAMS THE ONE THING THAT WHEN THEY'RE NOT IN CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PLAN, NOT IN THE CAPITAL BUDGET, AT THAT POINT IT BECOMES A LITTLE HARDER TO IMP IMPLEMENT IT. BUT -- IMPLEMENT IT. BUT WE'LL HAVE I THINK MAJOR WORK THIS FALL BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THIS COMMITTEE, SO I SUSPECT THE AMOUNT THAT WILL IMPACT THE IMMEDIATE CAPITAL BUDGET THAT ARE CAPITAL ARE GOING TO BE FAIRLY LIMITED. AM I --
01:04:25.971: >> WELL, I DON'T WANT TO PRESUPPOSE THE OUTCOME, RIGHT? SO I WOULD IMAGINE THAT PROBABLY THE BIGGEST CAPITAL JOWFT LAYS RIGHT AWAY ARE MORE OF THE STUDIES. WHAT YOU KNOW I MEAN?
01:04:39.051: >> YEAH, AND STUDIES GO THROUGH OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE BUDGET THAT CAME DOWN FROM FEDERAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS LIKE THREE YEARS AGO NOW, SO WE REPORT THEM IN THE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PLAN BECAUSE THEY LEAD TO CAPITAL, BUT THEY'RE ACTUALLY FUNDED THROUGH OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE, SO THEY DON'T GO THERE IN THE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PLAN, BUT NOT IN THE CAPITAL BUDGET. THERE'S ALWAYS QUIRKS.
01:05:00.572: >> GOT IT T OKAY. THAT'S HELPFUL. THANK YOU.
01:05:04.910: >> YOU'RE WELCOME.
01:05:06.078: >> VERY MUCH. I THINK THE WHOLE IDEA OF LIKE THERE'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT DECISIONS, YES, LIKE THERE'S LIMITED RESOURCES, THERE'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT DECISIONS, AND SO I'M JUST -- YOU KNOW, THIS IS ONE OF THE KEY THINGS THAT THEY USE TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS BECAUSE WE HAVE A GOOD PROCESS, BUT WE HAVE THESE PARALLEL TRACKS. SO I'M GOING TO -- I MAYBE WILL READ LIKE MY WHEREAS STATEMENT, AND YOU CAN SEE IF ANYBODY THINKS THAT WE MIGHT ADD TO IT. AGAIN, FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, I THINK IT'S HELPFUL TO REITERATE TO COUNCIL THAT LIKE WE'RE THINKING NOT JUST ABOUT WHAT'S BEFORE US RIGHT NOW BUT ALL THE OTHER THINGS THAT WE KNOW, ESPECIALLY SINCE WE HAVE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PLANNING COMMISSION ON THAT. SO MY WHEREAS STATEMENT IS TO BE ADDED, I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE AS THE SECOND FROM LAST WHEREAS STATEMENT. WHEREAS THE WORK OF THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR OR'S CARBON NEUTRALITY COMMISSION IS IT STILL FORMULAT ING RECOMMENDATIONS SOME OF WHICH MAY BE CONSIDERED CAPITAL PROJECTS, TO LET US KNOW THAT THERE'S SOMETHING COMING, AND THEN I WOULD EDIT THE RESULT , I HAVE THIS TYPED UP IF IT'S HELPFUL FOR YOU, MR. LENART , OKAY, THEN I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT THE RESOLVED STATEMENTS SAY THAT THE CITY PLANNING COMMISSION HEREBY APPROVES AS IT READS RIGHT NOW AS SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION FOR THE CITY'S MASTER PLAN CONTINGENT UPON LEARNING WHAT THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE CARBON NEUTRALITY COMMISSION MAY BE. THAT'S THE PART THAT I'M NOT SURE ABOUT, PERSONALLY. BUT I WELCOME ADDITIONAL IDEAS ON THAT.
01:06:47.812: >> COMMISSIONER SAUVE?
01:06:50.015: >> I'M OPEN TO, IT FEELS VERY OPEN-ENDED IN TERMS OF PUTTING A DEADLINE, YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE IT REQUIRES A DATE FOR SOMETHING TO BE DELIVERED, SO IT CAN'T BE CONTINGENT ON AN OPEN-ENDED DELIVERY DATE. POSSIBLY?
01:07:09.501: >> MAYBE IN SENSING WITH THE RECOGNITION THAT COUNCIL MAY WANT TO RECONSIDER THIS IN LIGHT OF THE --
01:07:19.244: >> RECOMMENDATIONS?
01:07:20.612: >> -- RECOMMENDATION MS FROM THE CARBON NEUTRALITY COMMISSION. PENDING RECOMMENDATION MS FROM THE CARBON NEUTRALITY COMMISSION
01:07:26.551: >> ARE WE THINKING THAT THE RECOMMENDATIONS WILL COME BACK AND CITY COUNCIL WILL MOVE FAST ENOUGH THAT THEY'RE GOING TO -- THAT IT WILL HAPPEN BEFORE WE GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS NEXT YEAR?
01:07:39.297: >> I THINK THAT THAT'S DEFINITELY THE INTENTION. THAT'S THE DEADLINE THAT WE WERE GIVEN, THAT WE HAVE BEEN -- BY THE WAY, ADDING EXTRA MEETINGS TO OUR LIVES, LIKE NIGHTTIME MEETINGS TO OUR LIVES. [LAUGHTER] YOU KNOW, GIVING UP VOLUNTEER TIME, AND THAT COMMISSION IS LIKE MANY DOZENS OF PEOPLE. WE ARE WORKING TOWARDS A DEADLINE SO THAT IT CAN BE INCORPORATED. I SURE HOPE SO.
01:08:06.625: >> OKAY.
01:08:08.293: >> I WAS JUST GOING TO COMMENT THAT WE WANT TO BE CAREFUL ON THE WORDING THAT COUNCIL DOES NOT APPROVE THE CIP ITSELF. THEY APPROVE THE BUDGET THAT GOES WITH IT. SO THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT WE SAID OR PERHAPS COMMISSIONER DOWN HERE SAID THAT IMPLIED THAT THEIR APPROVAL OF THE PLAN, WELL , WHEN YOU APPROVE T IT'S APPROVED. THEN THEY USE IT FOR THE BUDGET. SO MAYBE IF THE WORDING COULD BE TWEAKED A LITTLE TO SAY -- I MEENL, WHAT YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT IN THE SHORT TERM IS IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT YOUR GROUP ACTUALLY ADVANCES TO THE POINT WHERE YOU WANT IT APPROVED AS PART OF THE CURRENT CAPITAL BUDGET, IS THAT CORRECT?
01:08:48.433: >> RIGHT.
01:08:49.134: >> DO YOU THINK THERE ARE ANY THAT ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO BE CAPITAL PROJECTS, READY WITH THE BUDGET, BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO HAVE A SPECIFIC BUDGET, TO ASK FOR FUNDING IN THIS MAY BUDGET?
01:09:03.748: >> RIGHT. BECAUSE I AM ONE LOWLY PERSON ON THE COMMISSION, RIGHT, I DON'T KNOW ALL THE DETAILS, BUT I THINK THERE'S A CONSULTANT THEY'VE HIRED TO PUT TOGETHER SOME LIKE MORE RIGOROUS ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF THIS. BUT MR. LENART -- OKAY.
01:09:22.000: >> WELL, JUST AN OBSERVATION. AS INDICATED, YOU HAVE AUTHORITY OVER THIS CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS PLAN, AND IT'S BASED ON THE INFORMATION YOU HAVE NOW. THE CITY COUNCIL IS GOING TO TAKE THIS AS ONE RESOURCE THEY'RE GOING TO UTILIZE IN SETTING THE CITY'S BUDGET. THEY COULD PUT A LOT OF STOCK IN THIS, THEY COULD ALSO CONSIDER THE BALANCE AND PRIORITIZATION OF OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE COMING OUT OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS. I WONDER IF IT'S NOT SO MUCH ABOUT AMENDING THIS, BUT A BIT OF THE PLANNING COMMISSION'S SORT OF COMMUNICATION TO THEM, I THINK WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS WE'RE NOT IN A POSITION TO KNOW HOW THIS MIGHT CHANGE. I THINK WHAT I'M HEARING IS YOU WANT TO CONVEY SOMETHING THAT IF THERE'S ONE THING WE HAD TO PREDICT NOW, THESE PROJECTS, SOME OF THESE PROJECTS MIGHT HAVE TO GO BECAUSE RESOURCES ARE FINITE, IN FAVOR OF PRIORITIZING CARBON NEUTRALITY. SO THE CITY COUNCIL HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE THOSE PRIORITY DECISIONS INDEPENDENT OF THAT WHEREAS CLAUSE OR THAT RESOLVE CLAUSE. I JUST WONDER IF THAT'S THE INTENTION, IT COULD BE THROUGH A WHEREAS CLAUSE, TO SIMPLY SAY AS PLANNING COMMISSION, WE THINK THAT THESE PROJECTS MAY VERY WELL HAVE TO EVOLVE IF WE PRIORITIZE OTHER CARBON NEUTRALITY PROJECTS OR THINK ABOUT THE PLANNING COMMISSION COULD ENTERTAIN HOW IT WANTS TO COMMUNICATE THAT THROUGH SOME OTHER MEANS, BE IT A REEZ LUTION OR OTHER MEANS. TESTIMONY FOR THAT, A MEMBER OF THE PLANNING COMMISSION COULD ATTEND COUNCIL AND SORT OF CONVEY A RESOLUTION OF THAT PLANNING COMMISSION ENDORSES IT, SO JUST SOME IDEAS THAT I THINK ARE GETTING AROUND WHAT YOU'RE DISCUSSING.
01:11:21.820: >> COMMISSIONER ABRAMS?
01:11:24.255: >> I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY. WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS WE VOTE TO APPROVE OR NOT APPROVE A PLAN, THAT PLAN IS FOR A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY, BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEN CITY COUNCIL IS BOUND TO ACTUAL FUND THAT AMOUNT EACH OF THESE PROJECTS.
01:11:37.569: >> CORRECT.
01:11:38.269: >> OKAY. SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT THERE'S ROOM FOR THEM TO THEN PRIORITIZE OTHER PROJECTS AS THEY ARISE IF THEY COME FROM RECOMMENDATIONS FROM CARBON NEUTRALITY OR EVEN OTHER THINGS?
01:11:53.418: >> ABSOLUTELY.
01:11:54.285: >> OKAY. MAYBE IT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR ME TO JUST REVIEW THE TIMELINE? SO THAT BUDGET GETS ADOPTED IN MAY, YOU SAID?
01:12:05.563: >> RIGHT.
01:12:09.234: >> WHAT HAPPENS BETWEEN NOW AND MAY?
01:12:13.838: >> THE MICROPHONE PHONE.
01:12:16.875: >> YEAH, AND MR. LENART, JUMP IN IF I'M SAYING THINGS NOT QUITE ON POINT. BUT THE WHOLE ADMINISTRATOR AND ALL THE FINANCIAL PEOPLE ACTUALLY START BACK IN NOVEMBER TO BEGIN TO DIVE INTO THIS, THEY WANT CIP DONE, BUT THEY ALREADY HAVE SEEN WHAT'S IN IT, SO THEY'VE ALREADY GOT ROUGH STUFF FRAMED OUT ANYWAY. BUT THEY WILL WORK PRETTY MUCH NONSTOP FROM NOW UNTIL I THINK APRIL IS USUALLY WHEN THE ADMINISTRATOR'S BUDGET GOES OUT PUBLICLY AND THERE'S HEARINGS AND ALL THAT, SO WHILE MAY IS THE ACTION DATE, REALLY THEY'RE SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE, WOULDN'T YOU SAY, BY THE END OF MARCH? SO THE WINDOW IS VERY NARROW, SO AGAIN, THERE COULD BE THINGS THAT COULD COME OUT OF THIS THAT ARE READY FOR INCORPORATION, I GUESS I'M SAYING THAT COULD HAPPEN BECAUSE THEY HAVE SOME FLEXIBILITY. MY EXPERIENCE THIS EIGHTH TIME THROUGH, THERE MIGHT BE ONE TO THREE PRONLZ THAT LATER ADD OR DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN WHAT'S HERE, SO THEY VERY MUCH USE THE CIP AS I THE MAINSTAY OF THE BUDGET, BUT THEY DO HAVE SOME FLEXIBILITY, SO I BELIEVE THEY COULD FUND THAT, AND THEN IF THEY THOUGHT SOMETHING ELSE HAD TO GO, THEY WOULD PROBABLY SIMPLY TURN TO STAFF AND SAY HOW DO YOU THINK WE COULD ADJUST FOR THIS? THAT HAS HAPPENED BEFORE. IN OTHER WORDS, I THINK WE CAN MAKE IT WORK.
01:13:46.931: >> WHAT KIND OF TIMELINE IS THE NEUTRALITY COMMISSION ON? LIKE WHEN DO YOU THINK THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS WOULD BE COMING DOWN THE PIKE?
01:13:56.307: >> I KNOW DRAFT RECOMMENDATIONS, I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE SUSTAINABILITY OFFICE AND WE ARE TENTATIVELY LOOKING AT PRESENTING THOSE REMS -- RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION AS A BODY IN MARCH, SO I THINK AND THERE WILL BE A BIT OF A ROAD SHOW FOR NUMEROUS BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS AROUND THAT TIME FRAME, SO I THINK THE DPOAL IS SORT OF LATE MARCH TO HAVE MOST OF THAT FEEDBACK ASSEMBLED AND READY TO PRESENT TO CITY COUNCIL.
01:14:27.438: >> THAT'S EXCITING.
01:14:28.573: >> THE SCORING THAT WE'RE DOING INTERNALLY TO VET THEM IS LIKE FEBRUARY 8TH. IT'S LIKE --
01:14:34.579: >> OKAY, LIKE A WEEK FROM NOW, TWO WEEKS FROM NOW.
01:14:38.049: >> EXACTLY. YEAH.
01:14:39.117: >> AND JUST ALSO AFOR THE AUDIENCE WHO IS WATCHING TOO, THERE'S A BIG PUBLIC INPUT SESSION HAPPENING ON FEBRUARY 22ND AT PIONEER THAT'S LIKE A HALF TAKE EVENT SO THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE HEARING ALL KINDS OF IDEAS AND YOU'RE VOTING ON THINGS, SO IT'S NOT THE ONLY WAY THAT YOU CAN VOTE ON THINGS, BUT THAT'S ONE VERY POWERFUL WAY YOU CAN BECAUSE YOU CAN HEAR ALL THESE THINGS PITCH AT THE SAME TIME.
01:15:11.215: >> SO WE DIDN'T HAVE A FORMAL MOTION TO AMEND BECAUSE IT WASN'T SECONDLYED. -- IT WASN'T SECONDED. DO YOU HAVE A FINAL?
01:15:23.861: >> (AWAY FROM MICROPHONE).
01:15:26.164: >> COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT?
01:15:28.199: >> SKI CAN I ASK NOR ITCLARIFYI? I WAS NOT AT THE WORKING SESSION TBAWZ I DIDN'T WANT TO GIVE YOU GUYS STREP THROAT.  SO WE ARE ASKING -- SO ALL CITY COUNCIL CAN APPROVE IS THAT TOP LINE NUMBER, LIKE THE 116,000 WE WOULD SEND THEM, OR MILLION.
01:15:45.616: >> NOT EXACTLY. I KNOW, IT'S SO CONFUSING, BUT --
01:15:49.120: >> LET ME TAKE A RUN AT IT.
01:15:50.855: >> OKAY.
01:15:52.190: >> MICHIGAN PLANNING LAW SETS FORTH THAT THE PLANNING COMMISSION IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ADOPTING THE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PLAN, AND IDEALLY YOU ARE SHAPING THAT CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS PLAN BASED ON DEVELOPMENT TRENDS, WHERE NEW INFRASTRUCTURE MAY BE NECESSARY, WHERE UPGRADED INFRASTRUCTURE MAY BE NECESSARY. IN A WAY WHILE YOU ARE STILL THE AUTHORITY TO DO THAT IN STATE LAW, THE CITY IS REALLY FORTUNATE TO HAVE A PRETTY ROBUST NETWORK OF STAFF AROUND THESE VARIED DISCIPLINES WHERE SOME OTHER PLANNING COMMISSIONS ARE HAVING TO MORE ACTIVELY MAKE THESE PLANNING DECISIONS, SO THE DEV QUARTERBACKS THIS PROCESS WHERE A LOT OF SCORING EVALUATIONS HAPPENS AND FEEDBACK , THAT'S WHERE WE ARE NOW, THE PLANNING COMMISSION IS SOFORT FACED WITH THIS RESPONSIBILITY -- SORT OF FACED WITH THIS RESPONSIBILITY TO EITHER ADOPT OR REJECT THIS PLAB , THAT GOES TO CITY COUNCIL THEN, AND THEN CITY COUNCIL AGAIN TAKES IT AS ADVICE. THEIR ADVICE IS THAT IT'S GONE THROUGH THE EVALUATION PROCESS TO CORRECTLY IDENTIFY PROJECTS, TO PRIORITIZE PROJECTS, AND THAT GIVES THEM THE ABILITY WHEN THEY ARE THEN TAKING THE RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO THEM IN THESE VAROUS, WHETHER THEY'RE SYSTEMS OR GENERAL FUND AND TO USE THIS AS A TOOL TO DECIDE HOW TO PRIORITIZE THE EXPENDITURES OF THOSE. BUT IT IS A PLAN FOR THEM TO CONSIDER, IF FOR SOME REASON ON THE DAY OF THE BUDGET SOMEBODY COMES IN AND SAYS, YOU KNOW WHAT , THIS IS RIDICULOUS, IF THERE'S ONE THING WE SHOULD DO IT IS CONVERT ALL OF THE STREETS TO COBBLESTONE, THEY COULD THEN ELECT TO PRIORITIZE THAT AND ALLOCATE THOSE DOLLARS TO THAT PROJECT. SO THE GOAL AGAIN, THE COMBINATION OF STAFF WORK, OTHER AGENCY WORK, COORDINATION WITH OTHER AGENCY IMPROVEMENTS, WE ARE TRYING TO DELIVER THE BEST SORT OF REASONED AND INFORMED PRIORITIZATION OF PROJECTS TO THEM SO THAT THEY CAN USE THAT. BUT IT IS A PLAN THAT YOU ADOPT AND THEY -- THEY'RE NOT LIMITED BY THESE PROJECTS, THEY'RE NOT LIMITED BY THE AMOUNTS. THEY HAVE IN SHORT UTMOST FLEXIBILITY TO DECIDE HOW THEY PRIORITIZE. WE WOULD CERTAINLY ADVISE THEM TO LOCK AT THIS AS A RESOURCE AND THEY AS INDICATED THEY DO. THERE IS USUALLY VERY LITTLE VARIATION FROM IT.
01:18:14.699: >> SO HERE IS OUR QUESTION. IF THEY COME BACK AND SAY NO, LIKE IT WAS 77, NOW IT'S 116, THAT JUST DOESN'T FIT IN THE BUDGET, WE HAVE TO CUT IT TO 100,000 -- WHY DO I SAY -- 100 MILLION. ARE THEY PRIORITIZED? WHO COMES BACK AND SAYS --
01:18:31.749: >> WE ARE PRESENTING PRIORITIZED PROJECTS TO THEM. THEY'RE SCORED.
01:18:34.819: >> IN HERE?
01:18:35.686: >> YEAH.
01:18:35.953: >> SO IF 116 MILLION -- SO PHYSICAL $16 MILLION WAS CUT, WE WOULD KNOW IT WAS CUT, UNLESS CITY COUNCIL WAS LIKE WE WANT TO KEEP THIS PROJECT AT THE BOTTOM.
01:18:46.931: >> YES, OR IT COULD HAPPEN HAPPEN THAT WAY OR THEY COULD SAY THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND THEY TASK OUR ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT WITH RECONSIDERING THE SCOPES SO MAYBE THEY CAN AK DAYLIGHT A REALLY CRITICAL ASPECT WITHOUT SOME OF THE MORE COMPREHENSIVE ASPECTS OF THE PROJECT THAT WAS ORIGINALLY INTENDED, MAYBE IT BECOMES A LINING INSTEAD OF A REPLACEMENT IF APPROPRIATE.
01:19:06.684: >> OKAY.
01:19:06.918: >> DID THAT BUY YOU ENOUGH TIME? SORRY.
01:19:11.455: >> YOU WANT ME TO SHARE WITH YOU MY DILEMMA? SO THIS IS WHAT I HAVE RIGHT NOW , WHICH I THINK KIND OF GETS AT THIS IDEA THAT WE DON'T WANT THIS TO BE CONTINGENT, THAT UNDERSTANDING OUR ROLE VERSUS PLANNING -- OR VERSUS COUNCIL'S ROLE IN THIS. SO THE WHEREAS CLAUSE NOW THAT I WOULD SUGGEST OR IF IT'S BETTER AS ANOTHER THING, LIKE ANOTHER COMMUNICATION. I JUST THINK WE'VE GOT A WHEREAS CLAUSE BEFORE US, OR RESOLUTION BEFORE US. WHEREAS THE CITY PLANNING COMMISSION RECOGNIZES THAT THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR'S CARBON NEUTRALITY COMMISSION MAY INCLUDE CAPITAL PROJECTS WHICH CITY COUNCIL SHOULD CONSIDER FUNDING, LIKE I DON'T KNOW THAT WE CAN SAY CITY COUNCIL SHOULD DO SOMETHING, BUT I WANT TO SEND THE MESSAGE THAT WE KNOW THAT THERE'S MORE THINGS THAT CITY COUNCIL CONSIDERS THAN THIS AND WE WANT TO PING THEM LIKE HEY, DON'T FORGET ABOUT THAT LIST THAT WE DON'T HAVE RIGHT NOW BUT THAT MIGHT BE COMING. THAT'S MY RATIONALE BEHIND THIS. BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT WE SHOULD SAY SHOULD CONSIDER FUNDING. IS THERE FRIENDLY AMENDMENTS? OR IF WE WANT TO JUST GIVE UP ON THIS ENTIRELY, I UNDERSTAND AND I WILL GO TO A CITY COUNCIL MEETING. [LAUGHTER]
01:20:32.503: >> HOW ABOUT, SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO RESTATE OR I COULD --
01:20:39.910: >> TELL ME WHAT YOU GOT.
01:20:41.278: >> WHEREAS THE PLANNING COMMISSION RECOGNIZES THAT THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE CARBON NEUTRALITY COMMITTEE COULD RESULT IN CAPITAL PROJECTS THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PLAN, THE PROJECTS THEREIN, AND THE PRIORITIZATION OF THOSE PROJECTS.
01:20:57.228: >> OH, THAT SOUNDS SO MUCH SMARTER. THANK YOU.
01:20:59.930: >> SO IT'S A WHEREAS CLAUSE, IT'S CLEARLY BEING COMMUNICATED THAT YOU ARE TAKING ACTION ON THE INFORMATION YOU KNOW, BUT YOU'RE JUST SORT OF PUTTING A NOTE OUT THERE THAT ASPIRATION ALLY THIS MIGHT VERY WELL NEED TO BE RECONSIDERED QUICKLY.
01:21:18.516: >> YES.
01:21:19.617: >> IS THAT A FRIENDLY AMENDMENT? I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER WHO MOVED OR SECONDED, BUT AS LONG AS NOBODY OBJECTS.
01:21:24.889: >> IS IT IMPORTANT TO SAY ANYTHING ABOUT LIKE THERE MIGHT BE FY21 EX- EXPENDITURES, LIKE WITH THE URGENCY, OR DO YOU THINK IT'S FAIR --
01:21:36.634: >> I MEAN, THAT'S UP TO YOU. THIS IS THE '21 TO '26 PLAN, SO IT'S IN THAT TIME PERIOD.
01:21:43.541: >> WHAT ARE SOME OF THE THINGS YOU GUYS ARE CONSIDERING WITH THAT COMMISSION, LIKE POTENTIALLY IN THE NEXT YEAR COULD BE SPENT OR JUST SOMETIME IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS IS COMFORTABLE ENOUGH?
01:21:55.119: >>LY I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE'S -- AT LEAST THE STUFF ON MY SUBCOMMITTEE THERE'S BEEN LIKE NO TIMING PUT ON IT, BUT IF WE'RE GOING TO GET THERE BY 2030 , IT NEEDED TO HAPPEN LAST YEAR, RIGHT? LIKE SO -- YEAH.
01:22:13.904: >> COMMISSIONER SAUVE.
01:22:16.340: >> Commissioner Sauve: YOU GUYS ARE SCORING FEBRUARY 8. IS THAT YOUR PRIORITIZATION OR RECOMMENDATION OF PRIORITIZATION TOWARDS THE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PLAN?
01:22:28.752: >> DIFFERENT GROUPS ARE IN DIFFERENT -- WE'RE ALL AIMING FOR THIS MARCH THING, THAT'S HER GROUP.
01:22:33.657: >> GOT IT.
01:22:34.692: >> SO WE'RE ALL VETTING THINGS INTERNALLY, AND THEN IT GOES TO -- AND THINGS ARE ALSO GOING OUT TO COMMUNITY TOO, BUT THERE'S GOING TO BE A CONSULTANT THAT COMES ON BOARD TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT THE GREENHOUSE GAS FALLOUT BASICALLY IN TERMS OF WHAT THESE DIFFERENT STRATEGIES ARE. I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHEN THAT -- THAT'S SOON, I KNOW, BUT I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHEN IT HAPPENS IN THE SCHEME OF THE KIND OF NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS. SO IT'S BEING VETTED WITH THESE SMALL GROUPS AND THOSE COMMUNITIES AS WELL, IT GOES TO THIS GREENHOUSE GAS KIND OF BANG FOR YOUR BUCK BASICALLY IN TERMS OF THAT, BUT NOT BANG FOR YOUR BUCK IN TERMS OF GREENHOUSE GASES NOT IN TERMS OF BUDGET BECAUSE NONE OF THESE THINGS HAVE BUDGETS ATTACHED TO THEM.
01:23:21.238: >> RIGHT.
01:23:21.505: >> I MEAN, THAT'S THING.
01:23:23.040: >> RIGHT.
01:23:24.475: >> THAT'S THE THING THAT I THINK THAT COULD HAPPEN IS THE STUDY PART, BECAUSE THAT'S SOMETHING THAT REALLY COULD BE TURNED AROUND PRETTY QUICKLY. AND THAT COULD VERY WELL HAPPEN, YOU KNOW. SO THAT AGAIN SOUNDS LIKE THAT MAY NOT BE A CFP ISSUE IF IT'S A STUDY. BUT AGAIN, I DON'T THINK EITHER OF US FEEL COMFORTABLE ENOUGH TO KNOW LIKE OH, IT'S NOT THIS OR IT IS THIS AT THIS POINT IN THE GAME AND THAT'S ALL GOING TO HAVE TO FILTER THROUGH THIS STAFF PEOPLE THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH OUR GROUPS TO BE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHICH PATHWAY IT TAKES AND WHAT POT IT COMES FROM.
01:23:57.841: >> THE OTHER QUESTION IS, DOES EMERGENCY STATUS HAVE A SCORE WHEN IT COMES TO PRIORITIZATION IN CIP?
01:24:08.485: >> NOT DIRECTLY, BUT INDIRECTLY, BECAUSE THERE'S LIKE LEVEL OF SERVICE SCORING AND OFTEN THAT IS KIND OF INTERPRETED THAT WAY IN THERE, SO CERTAINLY COUNCIL CAN AND WOULD ACCEPT EMERGENCY AS SORT OF AN ENTITY ONTO ITSELF IN THEIR CONSIDERATION.
01:24:32.076: >> RIGHT. LIKE IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LOW SCORES DROP OUT FOR BUDGET HOW DO WE MAKE CLIMATE EMERGENCY HIT TO THE TOP OF THE LIST SO THEY MAY STAY IN THE BUDGET? I GUESS THAT'S WHAT I'M CURIOUS ABOUT. WE DON'T HAVE THE PLAN NOW BUT WE WANT TO KIND OF BE ABLE TO GET THEM SCORED LAST MINUTE, LIKE AND THEN THEY HAVE TO SCORE HIGH ENOUGH TO MAINTAIN, I'M JUST CURIOUS WHAT THAT PROCESS IS.
01:24:53.831: >> WELL, AGAIN --
01:24:55.733: >> FOR SCORING.
01:24:56.734: >> THEY'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT PROJECTS THAT ARE NOT IN HERE AT ALL, THAT'S AN INDEPENDENT SCOR ING SYSTEM, THEY WOULD SIMPLY PRESENT THESE ARE THE HIGHEST PRIORITIES. I DON'T THINK. 70 SOME STAFF THAT WORK ON THIS MAIN PLAN THAT ANYONE WOULD SEE THAT AS CONTRADICTORY BECAUSE IT'S A UNIQUE GOAL OF THE CITY THAT WAS ARTICULATED VERY RECENTLY. I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT BY FALL WE FIGURE OUT HOW TO INCORPORATE THE EQUIVALENT OF THAT SCORE INTO THE OVERALL CIP SCORING, VERY EXPLICITLY, AND I KNOW COMMISSIONER GIB RANDALL AND MILLS BROUGHT THAT UP AT THE WORK SITE AND I THINK IT PROBABLY WILL END UP BEING AN EXPLICIT NEW PRIORITIZATION CRITERIA IS WHAT I ANTICIPATE HAPPENING.
01:25:45.115: >> OKAY.
01:25:51.522: >> I WOULD ASK YOU TWO AS MEMBERS OF THAT COMMITTEE TO HELP MAYBE BOTH I, I'M NOT PARTICULARLY INVOLVED IN THAT PROJECT, AND THE REST OF THE PLANNING COMMISSION, I'M JUST THINKING ABOUT THE CONTEXT OF THE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS PLANS OVER THE COURSE OF MASTER PLANS THAT HAVE BEEN GENERATED OVER TIME WITH LONG AND WIDE RANGING COMMUNITY INPUT VERSUS PRIORIT IZING PROJECTS OUT OF THIS PROCESS WHICH IS ON A PRETTY TRUNCATED PROCESS, WHILE, YOU KNOW, I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE AS SPHIR SAITION TO HAVE WIDE PUBLIC INPUT, BUT IT'S A DIFFERENT CONCLUSION THAN A MASTER PLAN. SO AS WE'RE GOING THROUGH THAT, I THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO HELP, WELL, JUST EVERYBODY TO UNDERSTAND WHEN WE'RE MAKING THOSE TRADE-OFFS ON THE BASIS THAT THAT'S HAPPENING.
01:26:47.911: >> I APPRECIATE THAT, AND WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE THINGS, YOU KNOW , RIGHT NOW I BRING THIS UP BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS, AND AGAIN ON THE ENERGY SUB TEAMS LIST OF 36 PROJECTS, THERE'S ONLY A FEW THAT I CAN THINK OF THAT ARE ACTUALLY BE COUNTED AS CAPITAL PROJECTS. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT ARE LAND USE AND ZONING RELATED, A NUMBER OF THINGS, AND SO HOW THAT GETS THROUGH OUR PROCESS, RIGHT, AND HOW MUCH ADDITIONAL PUBLIC INPUT THAT REQUIRES, I MEAN, THESE ARE THINGS ACTUALLY THAT HAVE BEEN ON OUR TO DO LIST FOR A LONG, LONG TIME. INCREASING HOUSING DENSITY, RIGHT? LIKE IT'S THERE. A LOT OF THE THINGS IN TERMS LIKE REQUIREMENTS FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY, THINGS THAT ARE ON OUR, YOU KNOW, HOW TO CHANGE PLAN PROJECTS. SO I THINK THAT THAT'S REALLY GOING TO BE A KEY -- I MEAN, THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT, THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT IN OUR CITY IS THE BIGGEST CONTRIBUTOR, RIGHT?
01:27:55.345: >> THAT'S RIGHT.
01:27:56.180: >> IT'S THE POWER THAT WE USE, THE NATURAL GAS THAT WE USE IN OUR HOMES AND WORKPLACES AND THE CARS THAT IT TAKES, THE EMISSION S THAT ARE GENERATED FROM THE CARDS TO GET US TO AND FRO, AND WE'RE NOT JUST CONSIDERING THOSE CARS, WE'RE ALSO CONSIDERING THE CARS THAT COME HERE EVERY DAY BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE PLACES FOR THOSE PEOPLE TO LIVE OR THEY DON'T WANT TO LIVE HERE, WHICH IS LEGIT, BUT THERE'S PROBABLY SOME THAT DO WANT TO LIVE HERE AND WOULD RATHER NOT BE STUCK IN TRAFFIC. SO THERE ARE A WHOLE -- I MEAN, THERE ARE A WHOLE BUNCH OF PLANNING THINGS THAT ARE IMPLICATED IN THIS. SO STAY TUNED.
01:28:32.282: >> PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO LIVE HERE? WHAT? [LAUGHTER] ALL RIGHT. FURTHER DISCUSSION ON THE AMENDED MOTION? SEEING NO ONE, ALL THOSE IN FAVOR, PLEASE SAY AYE. [CHORUS OF AYES]
01:28:45.996: >> OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. THANK YOU, MISS GOSLIN, FOR ALL YOUR WORK.
01:28:50.434: >> THANK YOU.
01:28:52.436: >> AND WE LOOK -- AND WE WILL SEE YOU NEXT DECEMBER, THIS DECEMBER.
01:29:00.644: >> WILL WE START THAT PROCESS EARLIER?
01:29:03.213: >> I WAS GOING TO SAY, REALLY -- (AWAY FROM MICROPHONE).
01:29:20.531: >> THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. AT THIS TIME WE ARE IN AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION. MEMBERS OF THE AUDIENCE MAY ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION IN REGARDS TO ANYTHING AT ALL FOR UP TO THREE MINUTES. IF YOU COULD COME UP TO THE PODIUM, STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS FOR THE RECORD, AND YOU'LL HAVE UP TO THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS PLANNING COMMISSION.
01:29:37.114: >> HI, MY NAME IS NELLA, IS 16735 NORTH DRIVE, I'M HERE IN SUPPORT WITH SOME OF MY COLLEAGUE AS A SHORT-TERM RENTAL HOST, I WENT MICHIGAN, GRADUATED A FEW YEARS AGO AND DECIDED TO RETURN BACK TO ANN ARBOR AND I BASICALLY INVELSED MY SAVINGS IN A FEW UNITS HERE IN TOWN AND, YOU KNOW, WE DO A GREAT JOB TO BE GREAT NEIGHBORS, I TAKE IT UPON MYSELF TO BRING PEOPLE TO THIS TOWN TO SHOW THEM SOMETHING THAT I DISCOVERED WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE AND HAVE REALLY GROWN TO LOVE. SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE AND, YOU KNOW, WE DID THIS ABOVEBOARD, WE LOOKED AT ALL THE RULES THAT WERE ON THE BOOKS, WE SAID CAN THIS BE DONE, IS THERE, YOU KNOW , A FRAMEWORK FOR GETTING CERTIFICATES OF OCCUPANCY AND MAKING SURE THAT WE FOLLOW ALL THE RULES, AND WE DID, YOU KNOW, TO THE LETTER. SO WHEN THIS DISCUSSION ABOUT REGULATING SHORT-TERM RENTALS CAME UP, IT WASN'T A HUGE SURPRISE TO US, THIS HAS BEEN HAPPENING IN MANY, MANY CITIES AND I THINK CONTRARY TO SOME BELIEFS, WE'RE VERY MUCH ON BOARD WITH THAT. WE THINK THAT IT SHOULD BE PERMITTED, THE CITY SHOULD BE AWARE OF THEM AND THAT WE CAN BE HELPFUL IN THAT PROCESS. SO REALLY I'M KIND OF COMING BEFORE YOU FOR THE FIRST TIME TO KIND OF INTRODUCE MYSELF AND SAY WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO HELP AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THAT WE THINK THAT THERE'S A KIND OF COMMON SENSE SOLUTION TO COME TO, BUT AS SOME OF THE COLLEAGUES BEHIND ME SAID, YOU KNOW, WE HEARD FROM LIZ BEST NELSON TO OUR FACES THAT SAID HEY, THERE ARE SOME NUISANCE CONCERNS, YADA, YADA, BUT WE DON'T THINK THAT YOU GUYS WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE HOSTS SHOULD BE PENALIZED TO THAT AND THAT WE CAN COME TO SOME UNDERSTANDING AND ULTIMATELY THAT'S NOT WHAT WAS PROPOSED IN THE OPTION THREE FROM THE CARLISLE REPORT. AND THE WAY WE SEE IT NOW IS, YOU KNOW, THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF ADVOCATES FOR REGULATION. THERE HAVE NOT BEEN ANY ADVOCATES THAT I KNOW OF FOR THIS MEASURE TO BAN. SO KIND OF ULTIMATELY IT'S BEFORE YOU GUYS TO COME TO SOME UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT'S REALLY GOING TO FUNCTION THE RIGHT WAY FOR OUR CITY. SO I THINK THAT THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT IS TO ANALYZE WHAT'S ACTUALLY GOING ON, WHAT THE NUMBERS ACTUALLY ARE, WHICH AS THEY'VE SAID THIS REPORT REALLY DID NOT DO. SO ASK THAT THAT INFORMATION BE BROUGHT FORTH, IN ANY KIND OF PRAGMATIC SENSE THAT MAKES SENSE I THINK WE'RE ALL ON BOARD FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT RIGHT NOW THAT'S NOT WHAT'S ON THE TABLE. SO IT'S A VERY BIG CONCERN FOR US, YOU KNOW, AS NEIGHBORS, AS ANN ARBOR RESIDENTS AND AS SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS WHO SHARE THAT WITH MANY OTHER BUSINESSES, BE IT COFFEE SHOPS OR RESTAURANTS OR, YOU KNOW, VENDOR STANDS AT ANY TIME. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S A BIG, BIG BENEFIT TO THE CITY AND TO US AS INDIVIDUALS AND MICHIGAN GRADUATES AND I IMPLORE YOU GUYS TO AS THIS PROCESS DEVELOPS REALLY THINK ABOUT KIND OF THE IMPACTS THAT IT WILL HAVE BECAUSE IT MAY BE VERY POSITIVE OR NOT.
01:32:41.498: >> THANK YOU. LET'S SEE IF THERE'S ANYBODY ELSE.
01:32:52.375: >> (AWAY FROM MICROPHONE).
01:32:53.443: >> SURE REQUEST.
01:32:54.144: >> SORRY, I JUST HAD A COUPLE POINTS.
01:32:56.012: >> IF YOU DON'T MIND SAYING YOUR NAME.
01:32:58.782: >> YOU WANT MY ADDRESS TOO? 1524 MARION. SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT KEPT PLAYING OVER AND OVER AT THE COUNCIL MEETING WAS THAT THE NEIGHBORHOODS, THE RESIDENTS OF OUR NEIGHBORHOODS HAVE THE RIGHT TO EXPECT THAT WHEN THEY BUY A HOUSE AND THEY MOVE IN, THAT THEY ARE MOVING INTO A NEIGHBORHOOD AND THEY'RE NOT MOVING INTO A HOTEL ZONE. AND I TOTALLY AGREE WITH THAT, I DON'T FEEL THAT MY HOUSE IS IN ANY WAY A HOAGHTS HOTEL. WE DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF TRAFFIC. BUT THERE'S ALSO THE FLIP SIDE IS THAT MY EXPECTATION WHEN I BOUGHT MY PROPERTY WAS THAT WE WERE GOING TO UPGRADE THE PROPERTY, IMPROVE THE NEIGHBORHOOD BY DOING THAT, AND MY EXPECTATION WAS THAT I WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO RENT THAT PROPERTY. AND I GO AND I GET THE C OF O AND I SPEND ALL THIS MONEY WITH FIXING ALL THESE LITTLE THINGS THAT ARE REQUIRED AND EVERYTHING IS DONE ABOVEBOARD, AND SO THERE'S EXPECTATIONS AND RIGHTS ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS ISSUE, AND I HOPE THAT YOU WILL CONSIDER THAT, YOU KNOW, WE ALL -- THERE'S A SOLUTION HERE FOR A WIN-WIN, I BELIEVE, AND I KNOW THAT WE WANT TO WORK WITH YOU TO CRAFT A SOLUTION THAT IS IN EVERYBODY'S BEST INTERESTS. THE OTHER ISSUE THAT CAME UP WAS THE ISSUE OF ZONING VIOLATIONS, AND THERE WAS SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT, YOU KNOW, WE WERE RUNNING BUSINESSES AND NEIGHBORHOODS. WELL, I MADE THE POINT AT COUNCIL MEETING THAT THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF BUSINESSES BEING RUN OUT OF HOMES ALL OVER THIS CITY THAT GENERATE FAR MORE TRAFFIC THAN MY ONCE A MONTH OR TWICE A MONTH GUESTS THAT COME IN AND OUT. SO I JUST DON'T BUY THAT ARGUMENT, AND I THINK THAT WE NEED TO BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT TALKING ABOUT ZONING BECAUSE IF WE'RE GOING TO START TALKING ABOUT ZONING FOR RENTALS, WE'RE IN A COLLEGE TOWN, WE HAVE STUDENT RENTALS, WE HAVE SUBLETS IN THE SUMMER THAT ARE THREE MONTHS. THOSE ARE FAR MORE DISRUPTIVE THAN SOMEBODY'S AIRBNB HOUSE IN A NEIGHBORHOOD. WE KNOW THIS. THE POLICE DEPARTMENT KNOWS THIS SO THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT NEED TO BE THOUGHT ABOUT, AND I THINK WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN IS WE HAVE TO HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN THAT'S PUT FORTH THAT'S NOT SPECIFIC TO SHORT-TERM RENTALS BUT THAT INCLUDES ALL TYPES OF RENTALS, AND WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO WITH THEM IN THE CITY AND HOW ARE WE GOING TO REGULATE THEM TO CREATE A WIN-WIN FOR EVERYBODY. AND IF THAT REQUIRES BETTER ORDINANCES IN PLACE TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEMS, THEN THAT'S WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN. THANK YOU.
01:35:57.394: >> THANK YOU.
01:36:05.502: >> (AWAY FROM MICROPHONE). REALLY QUICK, COMMISSIONER MILLS , I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU SAID TONIGHT ABOUT ALL THE FISH THAT WE HAVE TO FRY AS A COMMUNITY. VERY OBVIOUSLY THERE IS A HOUSING PROBLEM IN THIS TOWN THAT DESERVES A COMPREHENSIVE HOUSING PLAN, AND I WOULD THINK BEING A PERSON THAT WORKS IN -- I'M A CONSULTANT THIS WORKS IN THE STRATEGY WORLD, WHAT MAKES SENSE TO ME IS ARTICULATE THE HOUSING ISSUES FIRST. THEN THE NEXT LAYER DOWN IS ARTICULATE THE ZONING PLAN THAT SUPPORTS THE HOUSING ISSUES. THEN YOU CAN GET TO THINGS LIKE STR'S AND LTR'S AND WHERE THINGS ARE AND HOW DO YOU MITIGATE TRANSITION IF YOU HAVE TO MAKE TOUGH DECISIONS. BUT I UNDERSTAND AGAIN THAT THERE HAVE BEEN DPLAINTS AND THAT'S -- COMPLAINTS AND THAT'S WHAT PROMPTED ALL OF THIS, BUT TO MAKE A DECISION THAT AFFECTS ANY PARTICULAR GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT ARE PAYING TAXES, NOT JUST PROPERTY TAXES, AND THEY'RE SUBSTANTIAL, TO FOCUS ON ONE GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE ACTUALLY MADE AN INVESTMENT IN THIS COMMUNITY FOR THE MOST PART IS TREMENDOUSLY UNFAIR, BUT EVEN MORE THAN THAT, IT'S UNFAIR TO THE PEOPLE THAT REALLY ARE SUFFERING BECAUSE OF THE HOUSING PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE THAT HAVE NOT BEEN CORRECTED, TAKE THE ATTENTION AWAY FROM WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE, AND IT'S JUST DOING THINGS OUT OF ORDER. SO I APPRECIATE YOU SAYING THAT BECAUSE I FEEL VERY, VERY STRONGLY THAT, YOU KNOW, THIS WHOLE THING SHOULD BE TABLED UNTIL THOSE FIRST TWO STEPS ARE WORKED THROUGH. AND I FOR ONE AM PLANNING ON ATTENDING AS MANY ZONING MEETINGS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT THAT I CAN BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S PART OF THE ISSUE, AND, YOU KNOW, WE NOW HAVE EXPERTISE TO ADD TO THE TABLE FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH IN TERMS OF HOW ZONING REGULATIONS COULD BE CHANGED, AGAIN, TO ADDRESS THE BIGGEST PROBLEM, WHICH IS AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THIS TOWN, NOT STR'S AND THE BEHAVIOR OF A VERY SMALL SUBSET OF GUESTS. SO THANKS AGAIN FOR YOUR TIME. I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE IT.
01:38:17.700: >> THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION? PLEASE. PLEASE DO.
01:38:26.142: >> (AWAY FROM MICROPHONE). SHORT-TERM RENTAL.
01:38:29.412: >> COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL.
01:38:33.783: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: CO ULD I ASK A QUESTION? I KNOW THIS WILL BE COMPLETELY ANECDOTAL, BUT IF YOU COULD COME BACK UP SINCE YOU OWN SEVERAL OF THESE.
01:38:40.957: >> SURE.
01:38:41.758: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: I' M CURIOUS ABOUT THE LEVEL OF OCCUPANCY THAT YOU ACHIEVE THROUGH THE YEAR OVER THE SEVERAL THAT YOU OWN, BECAUSE I'M JUST CURIOUS ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND HOW MUCH, YOU KNOW, HAVING IT AS A YEAR- LONG RENTAL FOR SOMEBODY VERSUS HAVING IT AS A SHORT-TERM , WHAT EFFECT -- I KNOW THERE'S SOME CITIES IN THE WORLD THAT ARE GRAPPLING WITH THAT. HUGE AREAS OF VACANCY BECAUSE THE SHORT-TERM RENTALS ARE FILL ED 20 PERCENT OF THE TIME. SO I'M JUST CURIOUS WHAT KIND OF OCCUPANCY RATE YOU HAVE ACROSS --
01:39:14.190: >> WOULD YOU BE PATIENT WITH ME IF I GAVE A TWO-PART ANSWER?
01:39:18.428: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: AB SOLUTELY.
01:39:19.362: >> I WILL ANSWER YOUR OCCUPANCY QUESTION, BUT I WILL DO IT WITH A LITTLE BIT OF PREJUDICE BECAUSE I THINK I CAN MAKE A VERY CONVINCING ARGUMENT BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE, THAT DEPENDING ON HOW FUNDS ARE APPLIED AND DEPENDING ON THE CONDITION OF THE SPECIFIC HOUSE OR UNIT OR PROPERTY THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT, THAT THE STR'S ACTUALLY HELP AFFORDABLE HOUSING MORE THAN THEY HARM IT. SO I'M GOING ON GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE. MY COMPANY HAS PROBABLY PURCHASED, YOU KNOW, 20 HOUSES, AND WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A FEW THAT WE JUST BOUGHT ON SOUTH STATES STREET, MOST OF THEM ARE NOT HABITABLE. WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS -- AND WE BUY THEM FOR A LOW PRICE. I MEAN, THEY'RE AT THE LOWER END OF THE MARKET BECAUSE THERE ARE THINGS LIKE FLOOR JOIST DON'T CONNECT INTO THE SIDES OF THE FOUNDATION OR THERE ARE MECHANICAL ISSUES, THERE IS ASBESTOS THAT YOU COULD SEE FROM OUTER OUTERSPACE, THERE'S BLACK MOLD. PLACES WHERE IF YOU WERE IN A SITUATION WHERE YOU HAD LIMITED FUNDS AND YOU COULD SOMEHOW SCRAPE TOGETHER THE MONEY AND GET A MORTGAGE TO BUY THOSE, IT'S NOT A PLACE WHERE CHILDREN SHOULD LIVE. SO THESE ARE -- MY COMPANY PRIMARILY BUYS HOUSES, WE RENOVATEM, WE PAY AN EXTREME INCREASE IN THE PROPERTY TAXES, AND THAT ALL GOES INTO THE GENERAL FUND, AND YOU GUYS DO WITH IT WHATEVER YOU DO. I WOULD HOPE THAT THERE IS --UP, THE MARGINAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT USED TO BE THE TAXES ON THAT HOUSE AND THE NEW TACKS ON THAT HOUSE, AT LEAST SOME PORTION OF THAT COULD BE PAID INTO A HOUSING PLAN, AFFORDABLE HOUSING PLAN. SO IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE SPECIFIC HOUSES THAT WE BUY, THAT WE PUT MONEY INTO, AND THESE ARE EXPENSIVE RENOVATIONS, YOUR OWN EMPLOYEE JUST SAID CONTRACTORS AREN'T MOTIVATED RIGHT NOW, AND IT'S BEEN THAT WAY FOR A LONG TIME, FOR THE LAST AT LEAST SINCE WE GOT PAST THE RECESSION. SO IT'S FALSE LOGIC TO SAY, YOU KNOW, UNLESS WE'RE GOING ON SAY PEOPLE THAT NEED AFFORDABLE HOUSING HAVE TO LIVE IN CRAPPY HOUSES. I'M NOT PREPARED TO SAY THAT. BUT I KNOW FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE THAT THE HOUSES THAT POSSIBLY YOU COULD AFFORD IF YOU WERE IN THAT FINANCIAL CIRCUMSTANCE YOU WOULDN'T WANT YOUR KIDS LIVING THERE, IT WOULDN'T BE SAFE. SO IF WE CAN STIPULATE TO THAT BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE, YOU DON'T HAVE TO AGREE WITH THAT, BUT THAT'S MY EXPERIENCE, IT'S VERY MUCH DEPENDENT ON, YOU KNOW , WHERE IT'S LOCATED, WHAT TIME OF THE YEAR IT IS, IT'S VERY CYCLICAL, YOU KNOW, DECEMBER, JANUARY, FEBRUARY VERY LOW TIMES, BUT WE DO HAVE ONE PROPERTY THAT IS -- IT FACES THE STADIUM, IT'S ON WHITE STREET, IT'S BUSY ALL THE TIME BECAUSE THE WAY WE HAVE IT SET UP IS THERE ARE SIX SUITES IN THERE, SO THE PEOPLE THAT STAY THERE ARE WILLING TO SHARE COMMON SPACE, BUT THEY GET THEIR OWN SUITE, BUT THEN IT'S VERY COMPETITIVELY PRICED AND THE PEOPLE THEAND UP STAYING THERE -- THAT END UP STAYING THERE ARE KIDS THAT ARE COMING INTO TOWN FOR GRAD SCHOOL INTERVIEWS OR THEY'RE HERE FOR SOMETHING OTHER THAN LIKE A FOOTBALL GAME. SO OUR OCCUPANCY IS ON MOST PROPERTIES IS PROBABLY ABOUT 60 TO 70 PERCENT MOST OF THE TIME. THAT IS MORE IN THE APRIL TO OCTOBER, NOVEMBER TIME FRAME, AND THEN IT'S PRETTY EMPTY, THEY'RE MUCH LESS BOOKED DURING THE WINTER MONTHS BECAUSE THERE'S LESS REASON TO BE HERE. BUT I WILL SAY, TOO, THAT ON THE BIGGER PROPERTIES, WE DO A LOT OF BUSINESS WITH PEOPLE COMING INTO THE HOSPITAL, AND I THINK THE THING AI PASSED OUT KIND OF JUST TRIED TO SHARE SOME OF THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE DIFFERENT PEOPLE THAT, YOU KNOW, UNFORTUNATELY ARE IN ANN ARBOR FOR THAT EXPERIENCE. SO OF COURSE ON THE FOOTBALL WEEKENDS WE'RE GOING TO GET PARTYING, BUT WE HAVE PEOPLE ABIDING BY THE RULES. BUT PEOPLE ARE DEFINITELY THERE FOR A FOOTBALL REASON, THEY'RE NOT THERE FOR ANY OTHER REASON, AND I DON'T WANT TO MAKE IT SEEM LIKE IT'S JUST A HOTEL FOR THE HOSPITAL OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. JON WHAT ANYBODY ELSE'S OCCUPANCY S I HEAR PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THE 50 TO 60 PERCENT RANGE AND I THINK THAT'S ROUGHLY WHAT IT IS, I JUST REALLY THINK WE NEED TO SEPARATE THE ISSUE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING FROM STR'S THERE. THE ONLY COMMON -- THE ONLY OVER LAP IN THE VENN DIAGRAM IS BOTH THINGS INVOLVE A HOUSE OR A DOMICILE OR A PIECE OF PROPERTY. THAT'S PROBABLY A MUCH LONGER ANSWER THAN YOU WERE BARGAINING FOR. BUT NOW THAT IT'S MIDNIGHT. THANKS.
01:44:11.454: >> THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. WE ARE ONTO COMMISSIONER PROPOSED BUSINESS, AND MR. LENART IS GOING TO GIVE US AN UPDATE ON WHERE WE STAND WITH THE SHORT-TERM RENTALS DISPLA YOU'RE PROBABLY WONDERING WHY ALL THESE PEOPLE ARE TALKING TO YOU. [LAUGHTER]
01:44:28.638: >> SO CITY COUNCIL DIRECTED STAFF TO PUT TOGETHER SOME INFORMATION ABOUT THE REGULATION OF SHORT-TERM RENTALS. THERE WASN'T SPECIFICITY IN WHAT OR HOW THE GOALS SEEKING TO ACCOMPLISH. TO THAT END, WE WORKED WITH A CONSULTANT CARLISLE WORTMAN TO HOLD A SERIES OF WORKSHOPS THROUGHOUT THE CITY WHERE THEY'RE JUST OPEN OPPORTUNITIES SEE SORT OF WHAT WAS ON PEOPLE'S MINDS REGARDING SHORT-TERM RENTALS IN THE COMMUNITY, WHAT THEIR EXPERIENCE WAS, SOME SORT OF PRELIMINARY DISCUSSION AT THOSE MEETINGS ABOUT SHOULD THE CITY REGULATE THEM, SHOULD THEY REGULATE THEM SIGNIFICANTLY, SHOULD WE BAN THEM, SHOULD WE NOT TOUCH THEM, SO THE INFORMATION FROM THOSE SESSIONS WAS GATHERED, I THINK THAT THE MAJORITY OF FEEDBACK AT THOSE SEGZ WERE THAT THESE ARE GOOD FOR THE COMMUNITY AND IF YOU REGULATE THEM, REGULATE THEM INSIGNIFICANTLY, SO I WOULD SAY THE MAJORITY WAS IN THAT FOR THE FORM. THAT INFORMATION WAS PRESENT HE HAD. COUNCIL LOOKED AT EXAMPLE ORDINANCE PS FOR OTHER COMMUNITIES THAT WE BELIEVE WERE REPRESENTATIVE OF SOME OF THE DIFFERENT APPROACHES, THE WAY THAT THEY ARE, THAT COMMUNITIES ARE GRAPPLING WITH THIS. THREE OPTIONS WERE INCLUDED IN THAT REPORT, STAFF'S RECOMMENDATION WAS OPTION 3, WHICH IS SORT OF THE MOST AGGRESSIVE AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK. IT WOULD DO THINGS LIKE PROBABLY LIMIT NONOWNER OCCUPIED SHORT-TERM RENTALS TO NON RESIDENTIAL ZONES. IT WOULD REQUIRE REGISTRATION AND AN ANNUAL PERMIT SO ON SOME BASIS THAT WOULD BE IN ADDITION TO OUR NORMAL INSPECTION REQUIREMENTS FOR PROPERTIES IN THE CITY. THOSE OPTIONS WERE PRESENTED TO CITY COUNCIL HAD A LOT OF DIFFERING OPINIONS EVEN IN DIRECTING STAFF TO START CRAFT ING AN ORDINANCE IN RESPONSE TO OPTION 3 THAT WOULD DO SO, SO THAT'S WHERE WE ARE NOW. WE DO NOT YET KNOW, FRANKLY, HOW THOSE ORDINANCES ARE GOING TO LOOK OR WHERE THEY WILL BE HOUSED, TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY END UP IN THE UDC FROM A ZONING PERSPECTIVE YOU WILL BE INVOLVED I THINK A LOT OF THE REGISTRATION AND LICENSING WILL NOT BE ZONING, SO YOU WILL NOT BE INVOLVED IN THOSE REQUIREMENTS. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAD FORMULATED STAFF DZ PERSPECTIVE ON THIS IS A NOTION OF TENANCY IN RESIDENTIAL AREAS IS DIFFERENT FOR SHORT-TERM RENTALS VERSUS LONGER TERM RENTALS OR OWNER OCCUPIED, SO THE EXAMPLE WAS BROUGHT UP, HOME OCCUPANCY, THOSE ARE PREMISE UNDERSTAND ON BEING RENTAL HOME OR OWNER OCCUPIED HOME, WE ARE FROM STAFF , SPEAKING FOR MYSELF, FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, WE'RE CHANGING THE TENANCY OF THOSE NUNTS A RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD HAPPENS THE POTENTIAL TO FEEL MORE LIKE A COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISE, I'M NOT SAYING IT ALWAYS DOES, BUT THE NATURE OF THAT TENANCY AND THE OCCUPANCY AND THE TENURE OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS IN THOSE AREAS POTENTIALLY DIFFERS FROM THE INTENT OF RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS WHICH IS ABOUT PEOPLE RESIDING IN THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS AND THE SERVICES TO LIVE THEIR DAILY LIVES. YOU CAN ARGUE THAT THOSE ARE DESIRED FOR PEOPLE A SHORT-TERM BASIS, THAT'S I THINK PART OF THE BENEFIT OR SORT OF APPEAL OF THESE UNITS IN THE MARKETPLACE BUT NONETHELESS FROM A LAND USE PERSPECTIVE TINGE THAT THAT IS A DISTINCTION, SO WE'LL SEE HOW THAT MAN MANIFESTS IN THE ORDINANCE IN ANY PROPOSED ORDINANCE. AS FAR AS ENFORCEMENT, ENFORCEMENT IS I THINK PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING. I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT SCENARIOS IN WHICH WE CAN SUCCESSFULLY ENFORCE, REGISTRATION IS GOING TO BE A HELP. I THINK WHERE IT BECOMES MORE CHALLENGING IS WHEN WE START PUTTING GUIDELINES AS TO MAYBE LIKE A NUMBER OF DAYS OR THE LIKE, WHICH IS JUST VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO ASCERTAIN. SO THUS FAR, THE CITY HAS IT ALWAYS LOOK AT THESE AS IS IT A OWNER OCCUPIED HOME, IS IT A RENTAL HOME? ALL THE SORT OF BALANCED USES THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO THOSE USES WOULD APPLY, SO I THINK THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS THAT WE CAN ENFORCE WHETHER IT'S FOR A RANGE OF OPTIONS, ONE OR TWO OR THREE, BUT THAT IS WHERE THINGS STAND, SO NOW STAFF IS IN THE PROCESS OF WORKING TO DEVELOP SOME DRAFTS OF THOSE ORDINANCE, MAKE SOME OF THOSE DETERMINATIONS AS TO WHAT SHOULD BE LICENSED, WHAT SHOULD BE ZONING, IF ANY, AND THEN WE'LL BE PROGRESSING WITH THAT IN THE COMING MONTHS. JUST FOR SOME DATA POINTS, SOME OF THE DATA THAT WE SURVEY AS PART OF THAT, WE COUNTED ABOUT 1400 SHORT-TERM RENTALS IN THE CITY THAT WERE RENTED FOR AT LEAST ONE NIGHT THE PREVIOUS YEAR, AND OF THOSE THAT REPORTED FINANCIAL DATA, THE AVERAGE PER NIGHT COST WAS ABOUT $96 PER NIGHT.
01:49:59.235: >> MISS ABRAMS.
01:50:00.870: >> SO YOU MENTIONED THAT THE PRIMARY SENTIMENT FROM THE PUBLIC MEETINGS WAS LIGHT REGULATION OR INSIGNIFICANT REGULATION. CAN YOU MAYBE PROVIDE SOME INSIGHT THEN AS TO WHY STAFF RECOMMENDS WHAT I'M UNDERSTANDING TO BE IN THIS EXTREME REGULATION?
01:50:18.154: >> THE NATURE OF THE USE. TINGE THAT ATTRIBUTING HOME OCCUPATIONS OR TENANCY OF A RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY IS APPROPRIATE IN NEIGHBORHOOD DISPLOANS, IF YOU LOOK AT THE INTENTION OF NEIGHBORHOODS IN OUR DISTRICTS IT IS SUITABLE. ONCE THAT OCCUPATION OF THAT PROPERTY STARTS TRANSITIONING TO A MORE SHORTER TERM, MORE, MOREE BASIS, I THINK THAT CAN BE SUCCESSFUL, BUT I THINK IT HAS A GREATER POTENTIAL TO HAVE SORT OF LESS STEWARDSHIP CONNECTION WITH A NEIGHBORHOOD WHICH IS VALUES THAT TYPICALLY THE INTENT OF OUR ZONING DISTRICTS AND OUR NEIGHBORHOODS HAVE VALUED TRADITIONALLY. SO THAT CAN OCCUR THROUGH A TRADITIONAL RENTAL MODEL, IT CAN OCCUR THROUGH AN OWNER OCCUPIED MODEL. ONCE THE TENANCY OF THAT IS MORE CYCLICAL, IT'S TONT SAY THAT IT IS GOING TO BE PROBLEMATIC BUT I THINK THERE'S A GREATER POTENTIAL FOR IT TO BE PROBLEMATIC AND I THINK THAT'S MORE COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISE THAN A RESIDENTIAL USE.
01:51:18.714: >> SWUFT DIFFICULTIES I SEE IN THIS CONVERSATION IS THAT IT'S SO ANECDOTAL SO IT'S MY EXPERIENCE VERSUS YOUR EXPERIENCE OR I HAVE A NUISANCE NEXT TO ME BUT I HAVE AN AIRBNB NEXT TO ME BUT I'VE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM. SO IT JUST SEEMS LIKE DATA POINTS WOULD HELP. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S SERVING PEOPLE AND ASKING THEM DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD IS CHANGING, DO YOU FEEL A SHIFT IN TENANCY, DO YOU SEE A PROBLEM? I DON'T KNOW IF THIS CONVERSATION IS ARISING FROM SOME VERY LOCAL OPPONENTS TO STR 'S WHO HAVE HAD SOME PROBLEMS OR WHETHER THERE'S ACTUALLY LOCK A WIDESPREAD PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AND IF THERE IS THAT PROBLEM, THEN IF ANYTHING COMES BEFORE THE COMMISSION, I WOULD REALLY WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE EVIDENCE OF THAT IS AND I WOULD WANT A LOT OF DATA. I DON'T THINK THE KIND OF I THINK THIS, I THINK THAT CONVERSATION IS GOING TO GET US VERY FAR BECAUSE WE ALL HAVE PERSONAL EXPERIENCES AND THEY'RE ALL GOING TO BE SO DIFFERENT.
01:52:11.734: >> COMMISSIONER MILLS?
01:52:14.536: >> Vice Chair Mills: JUST IN TERMS OF PROCESS, SO TO BACK UP TO THE BEGINNING OF THIS, THIS WAS INITIATED BY COUNCIL, THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT STAFF INITIATED. IS THAT RIGHT?
01:52:22.945: >> YEAH. CITY COUNCIL PASSED A RESOLUTION DIRECTING CITY STAFF TO START THIS PROCESS.
01:52:29.652: >> GOT IT. AND BY THIS PROCESS, THAT WAS BOTH THE PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT PROCESS BUT ALSO THE CONSULTANT AND THE STAFF RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT WHAT THE POLICY APPROACHES MIGHT LOOK LIKE TO MOVE FORWARD.
01:52:42.932: >> I THINK THEIR DIRECTION SPECIFICALLY WAS RESEARCH, POTENTIAL REGULATIONS, HOW OTHER COMMUNITIES ARE DOING SO, AND PRESENT THOSE OPTIONS BOTH FROM A LEGAL AND FROM SORT OF A POLICY PERSPECTIVE. I THINK TELL STAFF IN -- I THINK CITY STAFF IN PERFORMING THAT THOUGHT THAT BY OPENING UP THAT DISCUSSION TO THE PUBLIC HELPED US -- WHILE I WOULDN'T SAY THAT WE HAVE ALL THE DETAILED DATA BY ANY STRETCH, IT GAVE US MORE FEEDBACK OF SOME OF THE COMMUNITY EXPERIENCES THAT'S OCCURRING WITH THESE, HELPED US LEARN A LITTLE MORE ABOUT THE DIFFERENT WAYS THEY CAN MANIFEST THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF OPERATIONAL AND OWNERSHIP MODELS THAT CAN EXIST, AND SO YEAH, TO BE CLEAR, I THINK MY PERSPECTIVE IS NOT SORT OF A DEM OKTIZED ACCOUNTING OF THE MAJORITY OF FEEDBACK FROM THOSE SESSIONS, IT'S MY PERSPECTIVE IS I THINK IT'S A DIFFICULT THING TO PARSE IN A WAY AND I THINK ONE WAY TO DO THAT IS TO DELINEATE IT AS A DIFFERENT KIND OF USE DEPENDING ON THE DIFFERENT MODELS OF HOW IT MIGHT OCCUR. AND AGAIN, 1400 IN THE
