00:01:36.991: >> Aye.
00:01:37.558: >> Opposed?  The agenda is approved.  Do we have any communications today from our city administrator.
00:01:45.266: >> Nothing tonight, thank you.
00:01:46.233: >> Thank you.  We now come to public comment reserved time. This is an opportunity for members of the public to speak to council and community about matters of municipal interest. One needs to have signed up in advance in contacting our city clerk.  Please enter 8778535247.  Once you're connect please enter meeting ID 94212732148.  942-12732148. Once you're connected enter star nine to indicate that it's you and that you wish to speak and our clerk will identify you by the last three digits of your telephone number when it's your turn to speak.  Our clerk will notify you when thirty seconds are remaining and when your time is expired.  When your time is expired conclude your remarks and cede the floor.  Our first speaker today is Elizabeth Collins.
00:03:03.577: >> You can go ahead.
00:03:06.213: >> Yeah, hi, can you hear me? My name is Beth Collins and I live in ward five.  I would like to thank city staff for the quarterly update.  I hope they continue to do it and express my disappointment that I feel we are once again having an attempt to delete.  You are listening.  We are not only the experts and who are the same group of experts who brought you the very flawed 4CJ.  One of the things that was flawed was the attempt to discharge contaminated waters.  Initially these experts did not have a problem with it.  I am disappointed that you are not looking at the other experts. We have experts at card the community who has been involved with has had experts.  You have all signed and approved resolutions as has the governor.  The Washtenaw County did.  Ann arbor task force D. resolutions have been passed public comments have been had Are you trying to rescind the resolution without public comment?  As a  -- this is a polluter that sued my neighborhood.  We were drinking and when we tried to get them to pay for the problems we had they sued the residents and they won.  This is the same place that dumps dioxane waste and that's the main reason why we should be begging the EPA to come help us.  You may have the vote to overturn the will of the people but you will be ignoring the resolutions passed by the environmental commission.  Please, tell us what you intend, do you want more of the same of what's been happening for 40 years. Definitely injustice to the public.  There is not one pathway like was said in MY and if there is one you should listen to your constituents. This is not 2021 -- oh, this is 2021, not the 1980s, we should not be putting up with an uncontrolled contamination and being bullied.
00:05:45.005: >> 30 seconds.
00:05:46.173: >> Thank you.  We need environmental justice and finally after all these years. If Joe Biden's federal cleanup to help.  Thank you very much. Bye-bye.
00:05:58.552: >> Thank you.  Our next speaker is Rita Mitchell.
00:06:06.894: >> Miss Mitchell, caller 194. Go ahead.  If you unmute your phone, I believe you press star six.  Go ahead.  Caller with the phone number ending in 194. I need you to unmute.  Caller 194, if you press star six, you can unmute yourself.  Mayor, you want me to move on.
00:07:41.154: >> If the caller remains on the line, we'll pick her up on the back end.  Our next speaker is Vince Caruso.  Mr. KA rue KOE.
00:08:06.580: >> Can you hear me?
00:08:07.848: >> Yes, we can.
00:08:09.583: >> Thanks for letting me speak. Appreciate it.  My name is Vince Caruso, I'm a board member of card.  I would agree with Beth Collins' comments.  I would like to add, I would urge you to continue support of the governor issuing a concurrence letter.  Our local governments have voted in support of this and the group have voted in support.  With Biden in office, this is a good time to do this. There's been apparently some talk on council of not support thing concurrence letter.  We would like you not to do that. Additionally, 49 part per billion in the groundwater on the west side, when 29 is the vapor intrusion screening level is alarming.  The card group and the creek group worked very hard to get these simple groundwater tests and it shouldn't have been a hard thing.  And that's part of the problem we're having.  On Ann Arbor website, relating to basement testing of dioxane is inaccurate.  The city is not an incidence of vapor intrusion. This is part of the city website in it I quote in April city council authorized funding to test flooding in areas. Question, what if my basement doesn't flood and I live over the plume, should I be concerned?  Answer, no, when the dioxane is in groundwater, if your home is not flooded you'll not be in contact.  This is not true.  Vapor intrusion is a real issue.  The card group got them to implement vapor intrusion regulation.  We need to warn homeowners who have wet basements because if the water is con Tamm  -- contaminated could expose residents.  The group has made comments to that many times. We should have been testing more easterly with the groundwaters.
00:10:39.166: >> 30 seconds.
00:10:39.700: >> -- were not consulted on the effective locations to test. Even researchers are interested in thetest.  They shld be contactedy the city to deal with this vapor intrusion.  The group and card attended many of these meetings related to this effort but were not consulted when these plans were made. More of the reasons why we need to look at the toxic website. The 140 billion dollar company Donna hour is the owner.  EPA will make them clean it up and make them pay for it.  I think we really need to work hard to try to get EPA working on this contaminate before it further moves into the west side, thank you.
00:11:34.654: >> Thank you.  Our next speaker, Ralph McKee.
00:11:50.403: >> Hi, Ralph McKee, can you hear me?
00:11:55.342: >> Yes, we can.
00:11:56.943: >> I'm talking about the Gelman plume and the rules.  Good evening.  As to the rules I think regulating your speech outside of meetings is appropriate.  Remember Marjory Taylor Green but the provisions are too restrictive.  Calling out councilmembers is part of the debate which I remember Eyer said she's in favor.  I'm particularly concerned with Ms. Griswold while currently allowing Miss Briggs to talk about the press on the same topic.  But he used that same power to muzzle those that dis disagree.  Ms. Griswold told the press the EPA will do a better cleanup.  On one of your Sunday e-mail to Mayor Taylor you said she was spewing misinformation.  You didn't mention any of the flaws.  Same goes for Mr. D.  That was disinformation.  You also accused Ms. Griswold of sewing doubt and misdoctor -- mistrust. Isn't that sewing doubt and mistrust to say nothing of undermining our negotiating leverage.  All of these to send a concurrence letter.  For some reason she hasn't yet. Ms. Briggs statements undermine the namty that the governor is looking for and that we worked so hard to obtain.  A newcomer and not a lawyer and both the earlier attempt and this one is prompted by the city attorney or the mayor.  Her recent statement is virtually identical to the resolution. We've been SUR suing a parallel path. The city attorney and outside council have commented at public meetings several time where is the parallel paths were discussed I can't recall them ever indicating assuming the EPA would jeopardize the litigation did they fail to do their homework before or deliberately undermining the chosen strategy now there really aren't any other possibilities.  No other answer to that question.  The paths are visible now.  The litigation will involve initial pleadings that will take likely a year and a half and more for appeals.  The EPA requires a concurrence letter to start. If so -- the EPA trumps the state litigation.  If not, you complete the litigation.  It's not that complicated.  If there's a basis for some hang-up the city attorney needs to say what it is otherwise this is just a stall.  Thank you.
00:14:52.786: >> Thank you.  Our next speaker is Tom Stulberg.
00:15:02.262: >> Mr. Stulberg, caller 534. Mr. Stulberg, go ahead.
00:15:14.607: >> Good evening.  Can you hear me?
00:15:17.010: >> Yes, we can.
00:15:18.878: >> Thank you very much.  This is Tom Stulberg I live in the heart of the Lower Town.  I'm not going to talk about lower town tonight.  I will talk about a few other topics that I called in for.  A couple shorter ones.  Interesting last night -- two nights that we added a member to the council of the commons and he suggested adding an additional member for native American representation. It's probably not going to ponder that tonight but that's a pretty good idea.  Alan's always got some good ideas. Some of them come to fruition and this is a good one.  I would like to speak in favor of counciCouncilmember Ramlawi's t of evaluating the concept of snow renewal in the DDA area. It's definitely worthy evaluating and that there's a whole lot we can do and learn from others.  I know we wanted to learn from SnowBuddy which is a great organization that I support.  They're not the right model.  But there's a lot we can learn from them and probably a lot we can learn from other people as part of this evaluation.  So I hope you look into that.  I do want to talk briefly about the rules issue you're making rules about what councilmembers can and can't say and should and shouldn't say, social media, outside the meetings.  I want you to think about councilmember's proxies. Because they're there. Supporters.  People worked on their campaigns.  People who routinely attack other people on social media.  Lie on social media.  What are you going to do about them?  Are they speak for you?  Do we know if they are or not?  If you ban yourself from speaking in certain ways can you speak through proxies to get that same message across?  I don't know, that's a pretty complicated thing to regulate, isn't it?  So I suggest you think about that as you think about your rules.  What can you enforce?  And every time you make a rule, you better think about, how are we going to enforce this?  Then I'll talk about the Gelman issue.  The previous callers did a great job so I won't spend too much time on that except to say I'm tired of the secrets.  I understand while we were in settlement negotiations that went on and on.
00:17:48.528: >> Thirty seconds.
00:17:49.496: >> Because they're ongoing negotiation, there had to a lot of secrets kept from the public.  We're past that.  It's time to open this information up.  There's still too much going on behind closed doors on this.  The citizens have a right to know what's going on with our water.  I thank you all for being stewards of our water and for being representatives of your constituents.  That's us.  We'd like to know what's going on and be kept up-to-date and no more secrets on this issue. Who's going to clean this up? The lawyers? No.  Let's get there.  Thank you.
00:18:29.235: >> Thank you.  Our next speaker is Ariah Schugat.
00:18:39.612: >> Caller with the phone number ending in 145.  Go ahead.
00:18:46.186: >> Hello.  Can you hear me?
00:18:48.621: >> Yes, we can.
00:18:50.123: >> Perfect.  Hello, my name is Ariah Schugat and I am calling to discuss the issue of the DC-3 sidewalk snow removal issue.  It desperately needs to be addressed for people like me and everyone else who might have mobility, accessibility issues.  I personally don't but I need the sidewalks clear so when I'm doing my project on handing phone kit to the homeless community, I shouldn't have to trudge through knee deep snow and, you know, freeze, essentially carrying all this snow on my legs as I'm trying to cross the road and slipping and sliding and possibly getting hit by traffic.  The plows are not doing an exceptional job at all even on the streets, as I was walking down the street a man was plowed onto his own sidewalk unable to go to work. I'm only human.  I can't stop what I'm doing in that moment but after I had left the deLON that center, or actually while I was at the center I was talking to a gentleman there and we both had to run outside and push a car that was stuck in one of the snow drifts that the plows had, you know, created by trying to clear the roads. It's not acceptable.  And after we had got the cars moving, I attempted to go back to where I was and was nearly hit by a car that couldn't stop quickly enough.  So something has to be done.  This is unacceptable. And I expect the city to have a plan, do something.  It's going to be flawed but you iron out the bumps.  You make good to the systems.  They need feel safe when they're walking in the city.  I certainly don't. I can't imagine other people do.  Something has to be done. Please do something.  The things that you're doing right now are unacceptable.  They need to be approved and built upon.  You can do this.  You all have the power.  Compromise and make something happen.  So that the city can be safe together.  Thank you for your time.
00:21:14.534: >> Thank you.  Our next speaker is Michelle Hughes.
00:21:25.311: >> Michelle Hughes, caller 677. Go ahead.
00:21:29.415: >> Hi.  This is Michelle Hughes.  So, yeah, this morning me and Ariah were going to the DeLand that center to hand own phone equipment to homeless people like we do and we began our trip in the service area of snow buddy.  The volunteer organization that plows the sidewalks in our neighborhood. Demonstrate what it would be like to treat sidewalks as a transportation corridor. There's a plow passing my house as we speak. Now my finding was that it was perfectly fine to walk in our neighborhood but the instant we left SnowBuddy's area we were in snow up to our shins. People walking to work shouldn't be expected to wade through snow up to their shins or be required to have the ability to wade through snow up our shins.  We're able to walk up and down the street without a walker or a wheelchair.  If we D we would have bigger problems. There are people who need those things.  This is real life happening right now.  So far the city has told these people weon't care about them.  We need comprehensive sidewalk snow removal if we say it's too expensive and not practical we're continuing to tell these people we don't care about them and enforcement won't help. Even though there were several unshoveled sidewalks this morning no one was doing anything wrong.  They have 24 hours.  We need snow removal that is proactive.  At caucus we heard Councilmember Briggs talk about the efforts with the transportation commission. This is the right solution and this is the right direction and it's encouraging to see progress I'm concerned about how long Councilmember Briggs is proposing to take to produce these results.  Sounds like all next winter would be for observations.  I was hoping some of these could be practical experiments to be passed out next year.  Maybe we try snow removal in different ways in different areas and see how those turn out.  Tonight's resolution is one of those practical experiments.  Talking about snow removal downtown but I'm concerned that like the resolution that we saw at the last council meeting this doesn't call for the removal of snow that falls from the sky, only pushed out by plows.  We need comprehensive snow removal as quickly as possible.  I understand this is not something we have done before. This is something for us to be embarrassed about.  Clear the sidewalks as soon as possible. Thank you.
00:24:24.524: >> Thank you.  Our next speaker is Blaine Coleman.
00:24:48.481: >> My name's Blaine Coleman and I have to say that it's really impossible for you to call yourselves a progressive if you are willingly plowing money into the Israel DEefense Force to kill Palestinians.  City council is full of people who call themselves progressives but really not one of you can possibly be a progressive if you are defending Israel as they kill thousands of Palestinians with your money. It's just impossible.  I want you to ask yourself, how much aid you willingly pay to the Israel Defense Forces?  Are you willingly giving Israel that 38 billion dollars in military aid that it gets from the United States?  Well you should at least say no, at least say no. You can do that.  The money that you give to Israel for its military activities is a measure of just how much death and destruction you are willing to inflict on the Arab world. When you say yes to 38 billion dollars to the Israel military you are giving a huge vote of confidence to their very open and very loud massacres against thousands of Arabs and that makes it a whole lot easier for the United States to go ahead and kill millions more Arabs. Millions more Muslims from pasless tine to Iraq to Yemen to Libya to Syria to Somalia to Pakistan to Afghanistan. You know, you can do something to stop all of that murder of Arabs and Muslims which is done by Israel and the United States.  You can do something. You can say no.  Costs you nothing.  To just say no to military aid to Israel.  And you can be sure that you'll have quite an impact.  And you know, I think you must know the constant mass murder against Arabs and Muslims has had obvious effects against the entire Arab and Muslim population even in Ann Arbor and even in the United States. So stop it.  Just say no to Israeli military.  Here is a seven word resolution we have been pushing for so long in the Ann Arbor city council.  It's a very minimal.  Very, very limited human rights resolution you should be able to easily, easily approve.  It says we are against military aid to Israel. Now how hard is that?  You pass human rights for Burma, South Africa Wendy's and other things.  How hard is it to approve this simple human rights resolution for the Palestinian people?
00:27:56.836: >> Time.
00:27:57.403: >> How hard is it?
00:27:58.537: >> Thank you.  Our next speaker is Mozhgan Savabieasfahani.
00:28:08.547: >> Hello, everybody who is talking about EPA.  I want to very quickly remind you that the person who works for the EPA office was here in January 2020 and she told us all very loudly, very clearly that a feasibility study by EPA which would allow them to decide whether or not they will take on the cleanup of the Gelman plume contamination could take up to 30 years.  That's three zero.  30 years to even tell us if they will do it or not.  I am suggesting, put a millage to the public.  Give us a chance to say, yes, we want to clean it up right now.  You want to go after the polluter, after 30-40 years which you supposedly been going after them with no success and the polluters doesn't tell us whatever they like or not.  We are in a weak position in front of the polluter.  If you want to go after them, go after them, but give us a chance to tell them we want it cleaned up now.  If you take longer, it may not be possible.  The second thing is the resolution that we are against military aid to Israel.  I want to tell you that this community, since the 80s has been petitioning Ann Arbor city council asking you to stop aid to Israel to the racist state of Israel.  In 1984, 5,000 people signed a petition, brought it to your doorstep and said cut off aid to Israel.  You ignored them, completely.  Since 1984. Multiple people have come to you, have filled your chambers, have asked you to boycott Israel, while Israel has been killing people and you have TA turned a blind eye to that too. More recently we signed a petition and you ignored that too.  Two days ago I set up a change.org petition asking you to cut off military aid to Israel in a very short period of time 3 -- almost 50 people have signed that petition. This community has been asking for decades for you to stop military aid to Israel. Please.  Pass it.  It's very simple.  It's the least we can do.  After years after torture that we -- the American people have facilitated for people of Palestine.  We are against military aid to Israel.  Listen to the people.  They are asking you.  Pass a resolution that says we are against military aid to Israel.  That is the least you can do.  Israel is now withholding vaccines to people of pPalestine.
00:31:11.664: >> Time.
00:31:12.097: >> There is nothing you can say about -- thank you very much.
00:31:14.266: >> Thank you.  Our next speaker is Cory Holland.
00:31:18.037: >> Cory Holland.  (Inaudible).
00:31:26.946: >> Mr. Holland.  Phone number ending in 019, do you have a comment?  Mr. Holland, if you press star six, you can unmute your phone.
00:31:49.368: >> Can you hear me?
00:31:50.669: >> Yes, we can.
00:31:53.305: >> Okay.  Thank you.  I'm just going to get right to it.  I don't have much time.  I'm in the early stages of making some protests to come to Ann Arbor. Before we came to Ann Arbor I want you to know what we're protesting about.  I'm a black male.  Two lesbians decided they wanted a child and were going to get pregnant by a black gentleman and said they were beaten, kidnapped and raped.  Another child was beaten to an unconscious state. He was taken to the hospital and when they got to the hospital, they said I did it. They didn't say the child had father they said I was the baby sit and -- baby sitter.  A lot of actors in Ann Arbor help these women.  At the same time, the woman who was coming up with this conspiracy got involved with a local judge.  A lot of employees went to the Washtenaw County court to help these women.  The attorney's office has been investigating this but they don't have the same enthusiasm as those when the LGBT community is attacked. You got a local psychologist by the name of Joshua, he was hired by somebody at the Washtenaw court to do a report on the situation.  What he did was write a fake report.  What he didn't realize was I recorded every single thing he did.  When he sent his report to the court after they paid him 3,000 dollars I was able to confirm with my audio that he made a fake report.  Like I said, this conspiracy went on because of two reasons, the judge that got elected.  She said the coup didn't matter in her court.  Another judge who took after her, he found out what the women were doing he said in court that en if they committed crimes, he did not care.  The reason the women have gotten this far is they had people who were willing to help them.  So that's what's going to be happening.  I'm in the earlying stages to plan some protest to come there. We're hoping that the Attorney General takes the necessa steps that need  be tak cae we fl the's a double standard.  We've seen her many tim when someone in the LGBT community is attacked she demands justice.  But here you got the LGBT members from Ohio, part of some group and she has not doing anything even close to what she would do to call attention to the case. Thank you very much for your time and I appreciate -- I hope something is done in this matter.  Thank you.
00:35:05.664: >> Next speaker Rita Mitchell. Is Ms. Mitchell available.
00:35:10.269: >> Mayor, she is back.
00:35:12.137: >> Our next speeder is Rita Mitchell.
00:35:14.273: >> Caller 194.
00:35:19.044: >> Hello?  Can you hear me?
00:35:20.412: >> Yes, we can.
00:35:21.680: >> I would just like to suggest that you put the instructions for muting, raising your hand, et cetera, on the agenda.  I would really appreciate that.
00:35:31.857: >> Thank you.
00:35:33.659: >> My statement, in 1984, the pollution of dioxane was discovered just west of the sciences tank building was  -- where the chemical was inappropriately stored and misused and inappropriately regulated by the state.  I was lucky during that time I lived in a central area of Ann Arbor and I drank the tap water with little thought of risk I heard about the problem but had little awareness that my nearby fellow residents were experiencing a different situation they used well water in what was a township area at that time and were drinking 14 dioxane.  They were given bottled water to drink and substitute and had showers arranged in nearby hotels. That's horrendous.  I was unaware of those actions at that time.  Those people could not make a pot of coffee or offer their friends a drink of water.  They couldn't drink water that came from their tap. They couldn't use their well water to wash themselves. Things changed after that. There's a great quote in the history of events related to the Gelman pollution recorded in the Ann Arbor public library and it says it's a definition of irony.  A major water pollution cleanup.  We remain at that point of irony because the company that brought Gelman sciences has developed a superior method of treating water contaminated and used it to successfully treat water in Tucson, Arizona at its own home base.  The parent company can treat the water and yet it is not.  And that's why I say right now, let's move the process on.  We've worked with the company for a long time. They've delayed, delayed, delayed and I want to thank you for sending the governor a letter requesting her letter of concurrence in support of the action requested by council by the township board of trustees to request the EPA to initiate action for a cleanup.  We have the support of our surrounding jurisdiction, our state legislato legislators.  With their heart and support and continue to move forward with the EPA process.  Will it be slow but we've been waiting 36 years and the plume is continuing to expand.  I want to continue to be confident that the water I offer my friends and family is uncontaminated and I am sure you do as well.  The damage to our community to have a contaminated drinking system is significant and beyond any issue relating to having a super fund in town.  We need clean water and we need to move forward thank you.
00:38:30.469: >> Thank you.  Other communications today from coun council?  Councilmember Ramlawi.
00:38:39.745: >> Thank you, mayor.  I want to quickly give a shout-out to all the road crews and people in public work whs who have been working around the clock.  I know that's not up to some person's level of standards but it doesn't go unnoticed at least be my of us and we appreciate that as many of us are home safe. They're out there working.  I also wanted to talk a little bit about Gelman and I know it's nothing that we talk about much here in communications, but there have been some news stories and meet that was are going on.  And I just want to make it clear that it was the council's intent on a bill pass strategy.  That shouldn't be misconstrued for anything different.  It's been proof in our butting that we've approved additional spending on attorneys.  The last contract I think we just approved in the last 30 days was for another 170,000 dollars so the notion that we don't have an interest on this path is false based on our last actionable measures that we have to speak as a group.  So I just wanted to really put that out there.  And I look forward to a good meeting.  I hope we can compromise and lead to serve the people in the best way possible in the next few hours. Thank you.
00:40:22.314: >> Councilmember Griswold. Councilmember, you're on mute.
00:40:37.162: >> Sorry.  First I want to thank the township for hosting a meeting last Friday with mostly elected officials who serve as members of card.  Card is a coalition for the action to remediate dioxane.  For anyone interested in joining this effort the next card meeting will be on March 2nd at 10 a.m.  This will be frequented by officials.  Today I call into the lawyer intervener meeting regarding Gelman.  What I want to state again for the record is that the EPA process is a transparent political process by elected official to move forward what super fund site request.  The EPA staff are prohibited from speaking to lawyers.  So what I encountered today was a confidential meeting, basically, where lawyers were asking elected officials to provide information on what the EPA had said so they could quote advise us on the decision.  Now if we already have the information, why would we give to it the lawyer to advise us which makes it a non confidential process. So I would ask again that we please have a transparent process and that we rely on Congresswoman Debbie dingDingeo provide the information that is necessary.  We received a confidential communication today that, again, contained misleading information and in this meeting today, that was discussed that some of the information may not be correct. And we're waiting to get clarification from our Congresswoman -- I just want to say --
00:42:49.127: >> Councilmember --
00:42:49.894: >> -- thank you.
00:42:53.298: >> Councilmember Radina.
00:42:55.900: >> I want to give a quick update to council.  Something I sent out awhile ago.  I sent to staff a resolution around the Packard property.  That we are finally kind of getting pretty close to a final resolution.  I think we probably have something late last week but it was a little late to add to this agenda.  There should be something on the agenda for March 1st.  I know we're continuing to hear from members of the public.  Hopefully we'll have something to have a conversation about here this the near future.  I also wanted to give a brief update from the public art commission.  They have released their golden paintbrush awards nominations. They're seeking submissions for nominees until April 30th. Folks can find that on the city's website if they're interested in nominating themselves or someone else. And then also the human rights commission has been relatively busy.  Councilmember Nelson and I are working with them on a number of things. But they -- we will likely see some recommendations for some action from council here in the near future on changing some language in the nondiscrimination ordinance to open -- to allow for a longer period of time for folks to submit their complaints.  And also in a fair chance housing to make sure that we're more equitable in some of our housing options for former convicted folks -- folks who have been convicted of crimes in the past.  Expect those things in the near future as well.
00:44:35.567: >> Thank you.  Councilmember Disch.
00:44:38.403: >> Hi.  I would just like to let ward one residents know that -- whoops -- Wednesday February 24th, at 6 p.m. there's going to be a ward one committee meeting with the Ann Arbor Police Department.  And I was looking on the city website but couldn't easily find a link.  I will post a link on my Facebook page and I will send it out with my newsletter and anyone else who wants to know -- who would like that link, just send me an e-mail and I will send it to you.
00:45:17.909: >> Councilmember Grand.
00:45:18.743: >> Thank you.  Councilmember Radina and I will be holding our second virtual coffee hour at 4 p.m. on Sunday March 7th. We will be sending out a Facebook invite which anyone is welcome to join and if you don't use Facebook, please just send us an e-mail the day of the event and we'll be happy to send you a link.  I also want to thank the GM of a ward three business.  Phil Clark from Ray's red hots and he inspired me to reach out to staff about capping third party delivery fees.  I'm hoping that will be ready at our next council meeting and I really appreciate the work that our city administrators did to reach out to the local business ASOS associations and she's going to submit additional feedback before that comes. Thank you to Mr. Crawford for that and to Mr. Clark as well. forts on the councilmember ll administrativeommittee t work on just improving some processes for how we bring resolutions to council so we can have some standardization and best practices and certainly not anything that -- will be required but will give our colleagues more information about what our processes are before we bring a resolution to council and then finally, don't have a lot to say about this but I'm looking forward to next week's meeting of the city schools committee. Councilmember Song and I continue to hear lots of messages from the community that have been having some important discussions with different members of the Ann Arbor board of trustees.  So we'll be talking hopefully more about plans for September next week.  Thanks so much.
00:47:18.296: >> Councilmember Song.
00:47:21.633: >> Thank you.  This weekend was significant for a number of Asian and Asian-American communities celebrating lunar new year.  Traditionally the holiday welcomes spring and new beginnings.  This was busy for those struggling for waiting for new beginnings for children and the new school.  They're asking for clarity in school plans and fall plans and I am echoing Councilmember Grand here in that I've responded to remind them that the city and public schools are separate entities by share the same interest in making sure our children's needs are met.  We will continue to support collaborations and hopefully more teachers will be vaccinated in the coming weeks. Please reach out to families and teachers who are struggling to navigate a path forward. Thanks.
00:48:22.293: >> Councilmember Briggs. Councilmember, you're on mute I believe.  Or at least I can't hear you.
00:48:33.371: >> You can't hear me?
00:48:35.139: >> No, we're good.
00:48:36.641: >> Okay.  Great.  A couple things, thanks to Michelle Hughes for mentioning the resolution in front of transportation commission tomorrow night.  I encourage folks who are interested in that issue to take a look at the resolution posted there and welcome.  I'll carry forward the comments I heard tonight to transportation commission but encourage others to share their thoughts as well.  Also as one of the liaisons to energy commission I just wanted to let folks know that we, at the last meeting had began an educational series.  We had a presentation on municipal power.  The next meeting will be focused in a little bit more on municipal power and there's a whole series that's going to be planned this year.  So folks should check that out.  In regards to my coffee hours I have coffee hours, virtual coffees hours the Sunday before every regular council meeting and folks can find out about that on my website or my newsletter I send out bimonthly.  Not biweekly.  And then finally, I know that there was an article in MLive that has sparked folks' interest in Gelman and folks may be interested to know in terms of who I was chatting with that was my colleague Councilmember Ramlawi.  In the fifth ward because we are both interested since the plume runs directly under our ward.  In terms of transparency of those conversations that are happening in the community.  I fully agree and I would like to see another meeting of all the interveners.  We remain on the same page.
00:50:24.482: >> Councilmember Hayner.
00:50:25.383: >> Thanks Mr. Mayor.  Real quick, I am not sure if this caller is still on the line Mr. Holland who just called in. He had some legitimate concerns with the courts and, you know, that's not necessarily our thing but I would encourage him if he's still listening to reach out and e-mail us either as a body at city council or me personally and we will see if we can refer him to somebody else in the community that can point him in the right direction to see if he can get some help.  That was a shocking story that we just heard there and I'm startled by the potential injustices that were done there.  It's -- it was quite remarkable and so I want to do what I can to help that gentleman.  Whenever there's a question about our courts and there's concerns about neutrality in our courts I think it should concern us all because they really are the arbiter of justice in our community quite literally.  If he's still on the line I would encourage him to reach out to us and get somebody to give him advice and guidance.  I'm sorry for his troubles.  Thank you.
00:51:40.057: >> For  further communication from council?  I would like to request confirmation of the following appointment that was presented at our last regular session February 1st.  The commission of Zachary.  Moved by Councilmember Nelson. Seconded by Councilmember Ramlawi.  Discussion?  All in favor?  Opposed?  It's approved.  I would like to present the following nominations.  Dean, Lynn, the housing human services advisory board.  And Laurence O'Connell. Without getting into a big conversation about what was said I would like to state that it is my belief -- and I think it's held that we have a great deal of integrity represented by the judges mentioned by the caller.  And that there are -- well, you know, I have -- strong concerns about us getting involved in something that -- an unknown individual brings forward and mentions in this context.  We -- I'll just leave it at that.  May I have a motion to approve the consent agenda.  Moved by Councilmember Nelson.  Seconded by councilmember DPRIZ WOLD. Discussion please of CA-1. Discussion please of the consent agenda.  Councilmember Ram Ramlawi?
00:53:52.723: >> Thank you.  I wanted to go back if I could and talk about one of the no, ma'am -- one of the appointments.  I apologize but I tried to squeeze in there if that is okay with the chair? Or no.  I can wait until the end.
00:54:05.803: >> Is this one of the appointments that the person who was approved or --
00:54:12.476: >> Yeah.  The person who was approved.  It can wait.  If no not.
00:54:21.986: >> I will allow it.  You can cue this as a motion -- can you just give me nature of the -- is it just a --
00:54:31.896: >> I'll wait until the end.  As we talked about this consent agenda, I would like to pull CA-12 out.
00:54:47.244: >> Further discussion of the consent agenda?
00:54:51.115: >> I have a comment on CA-4 is something that we're doing and it speaks to our relationship of the regions and I hope that the regions and this body can sit down and have a broad ranging conversation about what we can find to be actions in our community.  I have a broader question about the consent agenda.  I don't want to drag out the voting on these by pulling things out but across a variety of topics on the consent agenda, there's six things on here that I could discuss but I don't feel like I wasn't satisfied with the detail either in the minutes or leading up to the meeting but I broadly would like to not consent to these items.  I would be casting a no vote for the entire consent agenda but I don't know the process for that because I've never done it before.
00:55:45.436: >> I guess it's -- when I call for a motion to approve the consent agenda, we take a roll call vote and you can express no.
00:55:52.443: >> Okay.  Thank you.
00:55:53.110: >> Further discussion on the consent agenda?  Roll call vote, please start with council Ramlawi with the exception of CA- CA-12.
00:56:13.964: >> Councilmember Ramlawi.
00:56:15.065: >> Yes.
00:56:15.900: >> Councilmember Hayner.
00:56:17.835: >> No.
00:56:18.302: >> Councilmember Disch.
00:56:19.970: >> Yes.
00:56:21.405: >> Councilmember Griswold.
00:56:22.273: >> Yes.
00:56:22.540: >> Councilmember Song.
00:56:23.707: >> Yes.
00:56:24.608: >> Councilmember Grand.
00:56:26.010: >> Yes.
00:56:28.679: >> Councilmember Radina.
00:56:29.246: >> Yes.
00:56:30.548: >> Mayor Taylor.
00:56:32.316: >> Yes.
00:56:34.285: >> Councilmember Eyer.
00:56:35.186: >> Yes.
00:56:37.321: >> Councilmember Nelson.
00:56:38.556: >> Yes.
00:56:38.823: >> Councilmember Briggs.
00:56:41.325: >> Yes.
00:56:41.792: >> Motion carries.
00:56:44.895: >> CA-12, rose solution to approve a street closure for Connor O'Neil's Main Street dining.
00:57:04.248: >> Thank you, mayor, this is being asked by the ownership, the management of Connor O'Neil's is asking for their annual Thanksgiving day street closure which was canceled last year and coming up here real quickly, March 17th.
00:57:34.778: >> That's St. Patrick's Day.
00:57:35.446: >> That's correct.  I've been talking with our merchant associations on Crawford as well as the DDA about our street closures for summer and spring as we had last year.  So we're already talking about that.  We are concerned about doing it too soon and we -- not that I necessarily agree with bringing forth a consideration for the council to consider but the consensus is to do it more at theegning of April and I knowllheseusinses down he are sufri a suffering greatly and even more on days like today and in fact, we were closed today.  So with that, I -- with a heavy heart, and extreme, you know, empathy with what's intended here by the ownership of trying to stay alive, I have a hard time supporting this in light of all the other restrictions and safety concerns that we have with COVID and I don't think it'd be a responsible vote from someone like me to say yes for this at this time.  And I believe there is plenty of opportunity still to facilitate business without having to close streets down and possibly have a spreader event.
00:59:03.200: >> Councilmember Disch.
00:59:06.036: >> Thank you.  I don't intend to vote against this.  But I wanted to just get some further clarification on the agenda question that I asked about this.  I do share a little bit of Councilmember Ramlawi's concern that we're facing a different variant of COVID and we're not sure about this and we need to take extra precautions that when we open the streets for this one day, it's not a continuous opening of the streets.  Just one day. People are safe.  What I read in the answer -- the agenda answers provided me were that the Washtenaw County health department requests that Connor O'Neil to provide additional staff to adjust chairs, also clean restrooms and, most importantly, take down names and contact information for contact tracing.  I wanted to know, had Connor O'Neil's let us know they plan to do all th this.
01:00:18.642: >> Mayor, we have a member who can speak to that.  I would like to remind staff and mayor under the new rules of council staff responses go with the councilmember's time.
01:00:36.927: >> Hi, this is Debra Williams, I'm not sure if Derek is on the line or not.  Connor O'Neil's, the organizations have been communicating with me and the health department as well. They are taking extra steps to make sure that they have staff on hand-to-hand L this.  They are -- if they're not having open seating, and they will be texting people if they walk up. To let them know that their tables are available so that there is no gathering at that time.  But they are saying that they are going to be extremely vigilant with this.  They are very aware of what's going on and will be very vigilant in making sure that people are being compliant with the health department rules.
01:01:28.912: >> Thank you.  I thought it was worth checking and having you spell it out.  Thanks.
01:01:33.851: >> Sure.
01:01:34.318: >> Further discussion of CA-12. Roll call vote, please, starting with Councilmember Raml Ramlawi.
01:01:48.732: >> Councilmember Ramlawi?  Any .
01:01:51.268: >> No.
01:01:54.171: >> Councilmember Hayner.
01:01:55.339: >> No.
01:01:56.006: >> Councilmember dish.
01:01:58.375: >> Yes.
01:01:59.743: >> Councilmember Griswold.
01:02:00.944: >> No.
01:02:02.012: >> Councilmember Song.
01:02:03.080: >> Yes.
01:02:03.814: >> Councilmember Grand.
01:02:06.049: >> Yes.
01:02:07.985: >> Councilmember Radina.
01:02:09.953: >> Yes.
01:02:10.354: >> Mayor Taylor.
01:02:11.922: >> Yes.
01:02:13.991: >> Councilmember Eyer.
01:02:15.058: >> Yes.
01:02:17.327: >> Councilmember Nelson.
01:02:17.895: >> No.
01:02:18.796: >> Councilmember Briggs.
01:02:22.299: >> Yes.
01:02:23.967: >> Motion carries.

01:05:26.550: >> I wanted to comment about something later in the meeting. I'm not -- I haven't done this before.  I did it wrong.  I'm sor sorry.
01:05:36.259: >> No worries.  Thank you. Anyone else who would like to speak at this public hearing about the Main Street site plan.
01:05:57.180: >> Do you have a comment?
01:06:11.561: >> Hello.  We can hear you. Please proceed.
01:06:15.799: >> Okay.  Sorry.  This is Michelle Hughes and I'm calling about this site plan it seems like a -- this is a site plan that doesn't require a rezoning.  And it will do some of the gentle density improvements that we'd like to see around town.  Or at least I would like to see around town. And it is -- since the developer has brought to us a project that is completely in conformance with our zoning code it's like we've -- they're doing -- we've been very specific about what we are asking them to do and they're doing exactly that.  And so I don't see a reason why this should have come to the city council.  It just adds more process and adds the false illusion of control where the city council doesn't really have control because -- and I've seen it happen here before that a by right site plan come to city council, city council votes no on it.  The developer sues because we had no grounds to vote no on it and then the city council has to settle because we had no grounds.  And that whole process just seems to waste time, waste money, and make it harder to develop housing which we desperately need.  This is one easy friction point to remove to make it easier to build housing around town.  Yeah, let's remove the requirement for by right site plans to come to city council.  Thank you.
01:08:14.384: >> Anyone else who would like to speak at this public hearing a any.
01:08:22.292: >> Caller with the phone number 205.
01:08:25.529: >> My name is Jo Spaulding.  I want to agree with Michelle Hughes and give some lived experience on that.  Especially in the bay area and different municipalities and there are 101 municipalities out there. Can string a project along for up to nine years and that's for residents.  And so when we think about from the process and improving it maybe I don't know we want eliminate by right projects from city council discretion in its entirety.  I don't know but I do know I have seen Silicon Valley planning commissioners say things like --
01:09:01.698: >> Excuse me, excuse me for interrupting.  My apologies, I was close to doing it with the prior speaker as well the public hearing does require that speakers relate their comments to 907 and 913 South Main Street.
01:09:17.447: >> I appreciate that, Mr. Mayor.  I'm sorry about that.  When it come to the specific properties, theact that the discretionary review has to happen at all on those specific properties is very curious because that is a slippery slope that can lead to situations where the city is getting sued by developers and if there's -- down the line, obstinate folks in planning commission spots that can cost the city money.  If we have the taxpayer responsibility and make sure we're being responsible for w the types of hard-earned money being paid in government I know everyone on council can appreciat that.  I think th's something that we really need to keep inind and specifically o the two that and oiously I've already taken up too much time on this public hearing so thanks a lot for that.  Apologies, Mr. Mayor, again.
01:10:17.607: >> Anyone else like to speak on this public hearing?
01:10:25.048: >> Mayor, I don't see any other callers with their hands up. May I have a motion to approve the minutes.  We had a special session and a regular session on February 1st and January 13. .  We have a motion and a second.  Discussion please of the minutes.  I would like to say quite briefly that members of the public may note that a new feature on the minutes and that is to say that we are including the rough transcript of our meetings closed captioning output.  As folks know our meetings are closed captioned.  We -- a -- student at the law school identified that the -- in the course of her wanderings that we were, you know, we had closed captioning but that we were not including that in a fashion that was easy for the members of the public to review and that is a change that we're willing to make.  I think folks will hopefully find it interesting and illuminating. I will say and caution that the transcript is a rough transcript.  There will be errors there but nevertheless I think the text is an improvement for folks' ability to understand what is going on in the meeting and perhaps search and learn more.  Further discussion of the minutes?  Oh, I guess by the way, I would like to extend my thanks to our indomitable clerk for her swift response when the inquiry was made.  Further discussion on the minutes?  All in favor. All opposed.  Minutes are approved.  DB-1, resolution to approve St. Francis of Assisi site plan.  Discussion, please of DB-1.
01:12:48.391: >> Thank you.  I just want to recognize the petitioners here. They did a really outstanding job having the site in ward three reaching out, honestly I think it was well before the pandemic started to welcome me as a ward three councilmember to the site and to talk about their plans for the expansion and so I think the fact that not a single person came to express concerns about it speaks volume to their process and want to recognize the intent of the expansion which includes efforts that align with St. Francis' mission of social justice.  I know one of the reasons why it wasn't just for reasons but also to be able to participate in activities like the -- to be able to host the rotating shelter, for example.  So really appreciate what they've done and look forward to allowing this to move forward.  Thanks.
01:13:53.556: >> Further discussion?  All in favor?
01:13:58.228: >> Aye.
01:13:58.495: >> All opposed?  Approved. DB-2, resolution to approve 907 and 913 South Main Street. Discussion please of DB-2. Councilmember Hayner.
01:14:21.818: >> Thanks Mr. Mayor.  What we have here is a demolition and a reconstruction.  We're tearing down two houses and building a single six unit complex. That's fine.  It give to something we've been talking about a long time and I guess I'll have to bring a resolution forward to get this on the books.  It speak to the notion of capturing what we have and what we lose and what we add and at what point and what type of housing it is so that we can develop an actual factual plan for our housing here in this city.  And so, you know, how many bedrooms are going away at what price point, how many bedrooms are being added what is our net gain and loss and so on.  We have a tear down and then you have to question what is going away and what is coming back and it's just -- I think it would be worth it for us to -- as a community to take a slice in time in where we're at and then take a look at what's on the books for it, what are these by right situations so we have a sense of what is available to development like in this case with this lock combination to get a better sense of where we're at.  I think we flail around looking to solve affordable housing and general housing issues in our community and we're not informed of where we stand.  I don't think we're working with the best information that we have. Nothing to this except that there's that situation of a tear down and a rebuild and we're not seeing, you know what, is our net gain as a community.  I'm sure there's a gain in units.  A gain in bedrooms and everything.  But just generally, I think we need to be more informed about decision generally so we can make the right decisions and meet our community goals. Thank you.
01:16:20.136: >> Further discussion? Councilmember Ramlawi.
01:16:26.075: >> Thank you.  Mayor, I appreciate what you're saying there Councilmember Hayner and you've been saying it for quite a while so hopefully it can be brought forward formally so we can get an inventory of what's being lost and what's being replaced and hopefully we're trending right and we're getting the right results at least an improvement.  We are displacing things in -- we're not entirely sure what the net result is in many cases but this obviously -- have -- my support.  There has been calls that by right developments should not require council consideration or approval and that may be true in some senses but the folks who are there who do it now, I don't know if they've been given all the tools and training that they would necessarily require to make those kind of decision and abdicate city council from the process completely.  It's good to see these things come through even when you do just rubber stamp them.  You have a better uerstanding of what's going on in your community, what's going on with policies that you're setting and where the problems are.  So, yeah, we rubber stamp them most often. It does not delay projects.  I don't see projects delayed because of these site plan approvals.  Hasn't happened on my watch.  Those concerns are not relevant here.  And so I just wanted to talk about those things while we're on the topic.  Thank you.
01:18:11.848: >> Councilmember Disch.
01:18:12.381: >> Thanks.  I just wanted to give a little bit more detail about the project.  It is a proposal to demolish two existing two-story homes.  Both of which are over two thousand square feet.  And to replace them with a 13,000 plus square foot six unit apartment building with 35 bedrooms. This is certainly a more efficient use of space.  The building will be -- will have solar on the roof.  It will have electric laundry and cooking appliances and so the solar will offset about 30% of what the unit -- excuse me, of what the project uses, of what the apartment building uses. The -- in my own view, I don't think that six -- five and six bedroom units are not my favorite kind of development. I don't think they're very flexible.  This developer happens, in fact, to be equipping this building with the proper firewalls and an excess of kitchens because if we were to eliminate parking minimums, this project could have a number of one and two bedroom units.  Which to my mind would offer greater housing opportunities than this current configuration does. This current configuration will be aimed at students and no one else.  I would like to see projects come in that can house a wide range of residents. This one in its current iteration is conforming to the parking minimum law that we have now but were that to change, this building would be attractive to differ people. It's also transit adjacent and that's good.  So in terms of the balance sheet of what we're losing and what we're gaining it looks good to me but it good still look better if our rules were stillightly different.
01:20:27.683: >> Councilmember Hayner any .
01:20:32.154: >> Thanks I want to thank my ward colleague for speaking to that.  It is a better use of the space, on, it's a net gain for the city.  And I guess only the thing I'd add to those fine remarks is this is by right because these are lots that are zoned R4C that are sitting there unbuilt because it took aggregation of lots to get this new structure in there and so we had that all over the city. We have a huge amount of untapped potential in our existing zoning and so -- at some point I'd like either by former recommendation or maybe you can do this councilwoman Ditsch.  We should look at these placements to chisel around t edges to allow this to be built.  There is so much potential, for more built housing, more of the type of housing we need.  I think it's great that someone was able to get these two together and work on it but I think it'd be b better but I think it'd b bet better -- more ecologically friendly and so on.  I want to piggyback on what you're saying and say, thanks for those good remarks.
01:22:07.984: >> Councilmember Disch.
01:22:09.552: >> Thank you, Councilmember Hayner and funny enough this is something I have mentioned to staff and with your very enthusiastic partnership in this I will bring it up again and we'll see where we go with it.
01:22:26.902: >> Further discussion?  All in favor?  Opposed? It is approved.  C-1, an ordinance to amend chapter 55, rezoning of 1.3 acres from TWP.  To R1A. Moved by counciCouncilmember E Seconded by Councilmember Disch.  Discussion please of C-1.  All in favor?  Opposed? It is approved.  DC-1, resolution to appoint Aidan. Discussion please of DC-1.  All in favor?  Opposed?  Approved. Eleven councilmembers present all in favor.  DC-2.  Motion to reconsider the February 1, 2021 vote that approved the resolution to approve amendment to the council rules. Discussion please of DC-2. Councilmember Ramlawi.
01:23:50.786: >> Thank you.  I'm bringing this back and asking for a motion to reconsider asking the body to cast a different vote on this.  I still strongly feel that there are some constitutional issues on this matter and would like to change my vote based on my oath to uphold the constitution of the state and the fed government and I feel I'm in violation of doing that.
01:24:31.060: >> Further discussion? Councilmember Nelson.
01:24:36.165: >> I would just like to add that the go-- folks who didn't know we did receive a legal memo on February 8th after we passed these rules about issues of related to viewpoint discrimination.  The idea that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust and wide open and I would like to move to postpone these rules.  Or actually I guess this is a motion to reconsider.  I guess that needs to be passed first. I would like to ask my colleagues to pass this motion to reconsider as a courtesy. We have typically done that as a practice however it goes after that I am simpympathetic Councilmember Ramlawi to have it reconsidered.  I would also like to change my vote.
01:25:33.322: >> Further discussion of reconsideration?  All in favor? Opposed?  Hands are kind of hard for me.  It looks to me that that passed.  Do I need a roll call on that?  I don't know.  Did anyone vote against that?  Very good.  It is reconsidered.  We have before us a motion to approve the proposed amendment to the -- to approve amendment -- let me get it more accurately.  My apologies.  You think I would know this by now.
01:26:19.602: >> Mayor -- the previous resolution is attached do you need me to send it?
01:26:24.773: >> No, thank you very much I needed to find it and then get to it.  Resolution to approve amendment to the council rules. Moved by Councilmember Nelson. Second by Councilmember Radina. Discussion please to approve amendment to the council rules. Now we're on the merits of the motion.  Councilmember Hayner.
01:26:52.735: >> I will say what I said last time.  I find much of this to be without much merit.  If we want better behavior we simply have to behave better and if we want to move things along a lot of that has to do with our public hearings and things but I don't favor taking away our speaking time or cutting away staff Q&A and taking away speaking time I find these rules sort of generally unnecessary.  That's why I vote against them last time so I'm happy to support this reconsideration and I would like to --
01:27:29.805: >> Thank you.  I think first I want to just challenge the notion that we received anything from our city attorney that raises concerns about what we passed.  The memo that we received from our city attorney was really framed around public comment and not the rules that we impose upon ourselves.  This is not a constitutional issue. In fact, it's, you know, the constitution itself that grants Congress, for example brought power to discipline its all members from criminal misconduct to violations of rules.  Such as using stationary.  Likewise legislative bodies from the state to local levels all across the country routinely rebuke members for violating rules and codes of conduct. City council censured of a councilmember for sending profane texts to a BLM activist.  They called his words inflammatory and unbecoming and say they do not reflect the professionalism expected of Lansing city councilmembers.  Rules of conduct are there to protect the institution.  The body needs this ability to say these are our values and we don't think certain conduct reflects those values and that's why I support these rule changes.
01:29:06.869: >> Councilmember Ramlawi.
01:29:08.971: >> There's a lot to go on about here.  The examples that my colleague pointed out to were actions that were taken.  And consequences were had because of those actions.  These rules that I have a problem with pertain to actions of members of council and viewpoints of council.  It's not necessarily the actions again.  I apologize for conflating that.  We are talking about motives.  And you know, integrity.  But mostly motives.  How do we measure motive?  I know that the firing of the former city administrator was not a popular move by and large.  Folks who voted to do that, their motive was questioned.  They were assailed.  In fact, right after that vote happened, our mayor went on social media and labeled our actions pure ego. We were kept from responding to many questions by why we voted the way we did.  To terminate the employment of our former city administrator.  We couldn't answer those questions.  Because of an agreement that was made by the admin committee that many of us weren't a part of.  But yet we cannot respond.  And we said, you know, that's just the way it is.  But what I see here is more about policing behavior than actually producing policy. We spent -- this new council has spent more time questioning others' motives and behaviors than they have on actual forming policy.  And making policy.  There is a high likelihood that there's viewpoint discrimination here with this adopted set of rules. And  will ask our city attorney since he's here right now whether this memo that is in question applies to the behavior that governs councilmembers as well as the advice that was given to us about public comment from the public and whether this viewpoint discrimination applies in this case as well.
01:32:03.378: >> The memo that went out on the 8th dealt primarily and it was a lengthy memo.  You wanted in-depth analysis and you've got that, was dealing with public commentary.  On the other hand, all of the -- constitutional issues that are raised out there or dealing with speech or other things it didn't specifically address that memo did not specifically address the internal cocil. But you were given advice on -- that related to council prior to the 8th.  Yes any so .
01:32:49.858: >> To I take that as a yes.
01:32:52.728: >> It is a yes but it's a different memo.  Yes.  Yeah.
01:32:57.766: >> Councilmember Nelson.
01:33:02.838: >> I want to thank Mr. Postema for clarifying that.  And I guess I want to echo what some of my colleague Councilmember Ramlawi mentioned.  My biggest problem with these rules that I mentioned last time was in the very subjective nature of how we measure them.  There are lots of ways that would be offended by a people charging me with motive and it's really just politics.  I bought a resolution asking for transparency that we have memo tt uld edate the publicndhere we talking points read at this table over and over again implying I was in favor of censorship and that goes absolutely as a motive.  When we discuss these rules, an example that was held up was Marjorie tailor green a woman who was spreading factually -- false information to inflame people in attacking private residents. It wasn't about people arguing with colleagues and disagreeing on policy.  These are, like, red herrings and so I guess I am always exasperated at this table when somebody pulls out something that is not a topic before us to reframe an issue to something else. But, you know, it's politics, right?  I would ask for a motion to postpone this to the second meeting in March.  I would like to see a similar memo to what we received regarding public speakers.  I would like a clarification from our legal department more than just the remarks we got now and I would like specifically send this to the ACLU and ask for their opinion on it.  It is not unprecedented for something to fly a little too fast through our legal department and come you should higher scrutiny and it wasn't too far long ago that we had to rescind an ordinance because it violated terms that the ACLU pointed out that we hadn't noticed when it passed so I would like to bring a motion to postpone.
01:35:19.574: >> Is there a second?  Seconded by Councilmember Ramlawi. Discussion on the motion to postpone?
01:35:27.048: >> Mayor, is there a date any to.
01:35:32.354: >> To the second meeting in March.
01:35:34.890: >> Thank you.
01:35:36.291: >> Councilmember Eyer, on the postponement.
01:35:45.367: >> No, I had my hand raised previously.
01:35:52.974: >> My apologies.  Councilmember ram Louis.
01:35:57.045: >> Does the whole motion need to be postponed or a part of it.  By and large most of these rules met the intended goal of shortening our meetings, reducing speaking times, et cetera.  The part of policing behaviors on -- and venues outside our council meetings was not a part of what was set out by the subcommittee to do. So I ask that we can adapt the parts that pertain to everything else and then refer the rest -- for further review.
01:36:42.390: >> Councilmember Griswold.
01:36:43.425: >> I would like offer an amendment that we simply strike the last two paragraphs of rule ten.  And that would give us an opportunity to implement all of the positives in these rule changes while getting further clarification and information from the ACLU on these two paragraphs and then they could be brought forward with the next set of rule changes that would be coming forward.
01:37:13.855: >> We do have a motion to postpone on the floor.  I don't think you can amend the main motion while there's a motion to postpone.
01:37:25.133: >> Oh, okay.
01:37:27.469: >> Is that correct Mr. Postema?
01:37:29.371: >> I think you should deal with the first one but the possibility of separating it out is certainly possible.
01:37:38.380: >> Further discussion? Councilmember Griswold.
01:37:41.616: >> Is that called split the question or something?
01:37:45.253: >> I don't know the act term, councilmember.
01:37:48.523: >> Oh, okay.  If I could move to do that, I would to split out the postponement of these two separate sections.
01:37:58.800: >> We do have a postponement on the whole still on the floor. Councilmember Nelson.
01:38:10.111: >> I just would like to say that I would prefer to have legal advice before we start slicing it up.  I'm open to the possibility that some version of what has been written might be okay.  I suspect not.  But I am open to that and I think that it's perfectly reasonable. I would hope it would be reasonable to postpone for a month to actually clarify these issues.  We actually made such an accommodation to clarify the issues in defense of speech from the public and I think there's a public interest in us not having a chilling affect on speech among our colleagues debating policy.
01:38:54.389: >> Councilmember Disch.
01:38:58.426: >> We did get some privileged advice on January 30th.  I don't know if it covered everything that everyone is concerned about.  It may not have covered the social media part.  I'm saying that because I'm honestly not sure and I don't want to say anything because it's not public.
01:39:35.363: >> Further discussion on the postponement.  Roll call vote please.
01:39:40.668: >> Councilmember Ramlawi?
01:39:42.670: >> Yes.
01:39:44.372: >> Councilmember Hayner.
01:39:45.273: >> Yes.
01:39:46.374: >> Councilmember Disch.
01:39:48.043: >> No.
01:39:48.610: >> Councilmember Griswold.
01:39:50.578: >> Yes.
01:39:54.382: >> Councilmember Song.
01:39:56.117: >> No.
01:39:57.352: >> Councilmember Grand.
01:39:57.886: >> No.
01:39:59.988: >> Councilmember Radina.
01:40:01.022: >> No.
01:40:02.390: >> Mayor Taylor.
01:40:04.626: >> No.
01:40:04.893: >> Councilmember Eyer?
01:40:06.227: >> No.
01:40:07.362: >> Councilmember Nelson?
01:40:10.098: >> Yes.
01:40:13.535: >> Councilmember Briggs?
01:40:25.880: >> No.
01:40:27.015: >> Motion fails.
01:40:28.083: >> Discussion of the main motion.  Councilmember Eyer, you were on the queue earlier --
01:40:34.556: >> I'll wait.
01:40:36.191: >> Councilmember Grand.
01:40:38.960: >> Thank you.  The councilmember who is asked to bring this forward for reconsideration said that their intent was to put a vote on the record that we want the opposite of how their vote went before so I was, you know, pleased to let them vote how they felt it was the right way to go but that's not the conversation that we are having.  I supported the rule changes the first time and will support them again because I think they're important and if they're not working, we can bring them back at another time but we haven't even given them a full meeting so I'm going to keep using I statements and I'm looking forward to supporting this again.
01:41:34.449: >> Councilmember ram Louis.
01:41:36.217: >> I appreciate the courtesy to allow me to change my vote on this.  I think that's -- It's important for us to have these conversations.  You know. I know many members care to speak less and some don't want to speak at all.  But I'm not one of those folks.  I think many people in the community love to hear a robust conversation.  Love to hear the public debate.  Love to hear why we're taking the positions we're taking.  This is a big part of our jobs and I know many people would rather not take and would rather say yes, yes, no, no and that's it, go home.  That's not why I joined council and that's not why people support.  You know, the issues here govern people's behaviors.  It's not about what's best for government, what's tailored for the government interest.  This viewpoint discrimination going on.  And we didn't receive a good legal analysis from our legal department.  It was rushed at best.  This is getting reviewed by other constitutional scholars and it will be brought back and this will be challenged now would this body like to do the right thing and uphold the constitution that they swore to protect or are they going to just look the other way?  And I think we know where it's going. That being said, I would like to make it a motion to strike out the last two paragraphs of rule ten that caused me consternation.  So I put forward that motion.  If that's parliamentary possible.
01:43:34.569: >> Is there a second?  Seconded by Councilmember Nelson. Discussionlease of the amendment to remove the last two paragraphs with respect to personal privilege and redress of grievances.  Councilmember Griswold on the amendment.
01:43:52.120: >> I would support the amendment if there is some intent to bring back those two paragraphs after they've been reviewed by the ACLU.  So I guess I'm saying that my vote is actually for further research on those and there is an option to move to abide the resolution if councilmember ram Louis would like to withdraw his amendment.
01:44:38.366: >> My amendments are the body's --
01:44:41.769: >> Okay.
01:44:42.437: >> Further discussion of the amendment.  Councilmember Briggs.  Councilmember, you're on mute.
01:44:56.551: >> Am I still on mute?
01:44:58.453: >> No.  You're okay. a delayed reaction.  Anyway. My apologies, I just wanted to, I guess, point to -- suggest -- I will not be voting to removing this section.  I -- as Councilmember Grand earlier stated, this -- the idea was that we are reconsidering individual votes on this matter.  We had a lengthy discussion about the rules at our last meeting.  The point of points of ourules wo increase the effiency ur meeting.  We can do thi meeting after meeting.  We can bring back issues and discuss them.  But that is not -- I don't think also in the benefit of the community.
01:45:56.244: >> Councilmember ram Louis.
01:45:58.112: >> I understand that I would like to change my vote on this and I'm hoping to convince others to change their votes as well.  It really doesn't seem like it's going happen again. There's a pretty strong wall of votes that just don't waiver. In and this will be challenged. It will be challenged by the ACLU.  It will be challenged by others.  You'll be found to be upholding an unconstitutional rule and that is the right of all of us to have that vote and if that's where you decide to vote, that's your prerogative. But I'm not going to support what I feel is unconstitutional.
01:46:51.933: >> Councilmember Hayner.
01:46:52.467: >> I support striking these two paragraphs.  I view these generally as the most ripe for abuse.  So, yeah, I have no problem with that.  Let's strike these two.
01:47:05.446: >> Councilmember Radina.
01:47:15.189: >> Thanks.  I would echo what Councilmember Briggs.  I am frustrated by the suggestion that there's some immovable wall.  I think we've just had this conversation and I think people made up their mind at the last meeting and I think this very conversation is evidence that if we give these rules a try or if we have feedback from others that things need to be changed that it's actually really easy for us to reconsider our rules and to change them. As a body.  But I hope that -- I mean, I think we're conflating a lot of suggestion that we're trying to police policy debate.  And I think we're all aware based on conversations that have happened and attacks that have been made here and on social media that that is not what is trying to be regulated here.  I will be voting no on this.  I don't think any of us thought we should not be able to voice a policy difference but we need to stop the attacks and move forward and if we find we need tweaking to our rules, we, as a body, can do that and I will vote no on this and an I m make -- I make a motion.  U thanks.
01:48:34.435: >> Further discussion.  I will vote no on the amendment.  I will observe I think there's a difference of what's being said here that connects with the point of personal privilege and the redress of grievance paragraph. The point of personal privilege really restates what already exists in Robert's Rules and so I think that describes the context in which -- and describes -- provides a structure for someone who wishes to raise a point of personal privilege.  Something which is already their right. With respect to the reference to the administration committee, you know, I'll take the advice that our attorneys have given us and in the event that the ACLU a highly respected organization provides alternative device, well, then that's new data and new data, you know, will always requires -- you know, a reflection.  And -- but until that time, I'll stick with what we have.  Further discussion of the amendment?  Roll call vote, please, starting with Councilmember Ramlawi to remove the last two paragraphs of rule ten.
01:49:53.914: >> Councilmember ram Louis?
01:49:56.283: >> Yes.
01:49:58.486: >> Councilmember Hayner?

01:50:30.418: >> Councilmember Nelson?
01:50:31.185: >> Yes.
01:50:32.486: >> Councilmember Briggs?
01:50:34.522: >> Yes.
01:50:36.957: >> Motion fails.
01:50:42.096: >> Further discussion of the motion.  I believe Councilmember Eyer, you're in the queue.
01:50:46.534: >> I'm good.
01:50:47.234: >> Further discussion of the main motion?  Councilmember Ramlawi?
01:50:56.944: >> I just hope to come back in about a month or two and say I told you so.  So that's all.
01:51:06.420: >> Councilmember Hayner.
01:51:07.321: >> Yes, Mr. Mayor, I have a process question.  If we did want to bring a change to the rules at some point in the future either to a section that we have just recently adopted or a current section that hasn't been updated in a while what is the process for that. Can we bring that as a resolution as a member of council.
01:51:35.182: >> I guess I will refer to Mr. Postema on that but I think it goes to rules/admin however I don't know that that's a formal consent.  Mr. Postema, can you confirm, deny or modify that?
01:51:55.603: >> Any councilmember can certainly bring a resolution. That's always been a hallmark of things.  They usually then been referred to.  But I think that the process -- every admin committee is going to be dealing with various rules probably for the next several months.  Certainly that's going forward with the public comment.  There'll be discussions obviously about rule twelve and the application of other rules and where things can tgo and my understanding i there are likely to be a number of changes and discussions and that's properly so as to Councilmember Nelson's, yes, are you going to continue to get updates, very thorough updates of the prior memo and additional things.  You'll have an opportunity to look at all sorts of rules so my suggestion is to send it to an admin. That might be the easiest way to do it.  But I think my understanding is that that they're working very carefully on that and there's going to be continuing changes whether it's tweaks or changes or applications, looking at how things are applied.  Yes, it's going to be continuous.
01:53:23.490: >> Okay.  Thank you very much. When we -- it really gave me a lot to think about and I appreciate the distinctions made in there.  It was enlightening in there and well worth it.  Thank you for that. The kind of things I'm suggesting are not radical notions but we cut a minute off our speaking time basically and I feel if we only get five minutes it would be better than saying we have three minutes and two minutes.  We can say I want five minutes.  I want a minute five times.  I know it'd be difficult for the chair but it can increase the dialogue at the table which is beneficial to our constituents and the formation of better policy ideas than what we are working with now.
01:54:10.070: >> Councilmember Hayner, thank you for the comment and as to Councilmember Nelson's comments, again, you will be getting additional memos on many issues related to that.  I hope it is helpful.
01:54:22.383: >> Councilmember Nelson.
01:54:24.051: >> Thank you.  I have a quick question for Mr. Postema because it was mentioned and I want to clarify, when we're talking about processes, this is sort of piggybacking off of Councilmember Hayner's question.  The rules and administration committee, what is the process.  Did it go through the committee and then council or council first and then to the administration commission -- or committee.
01:54:51.145: >> I'm not sure I'm understanding your question. You -- I mean.
01:55:03.557: >> I mean the elimination of the rules committee.  What was the process.
01:55:07.661: >> The process under the charter is that is -- those council committees are appointed if that's the -- I don't have the charter here, but that's a mayoral commission and when it comes up that would be his discretion to form or not form a committee.  So that's my understanding of the mayor's power to form council committees.
01:55:35.856: >> So none of them have to exist?  They're all at the -- they're all discretionary.
01:55:41.161: >> Yes.  Those are mayoral committees that he forms.  Yes.
01:55:50.537: >> So none of them have to exist?  They could be eliminated.
01:55:56.643: >> They could be.  In practice, some of the jobs that need to be done would not get done and that would be true for the administration committee.  The administration committee, by the way, did the rules committee -- did the rules for many, many years and the rules committee was set up to specifically handle the initial composition of the rules when that was deemed necessary and so that's how it was spun off in a sense.  It was a recognition.  The mayor recognized and I believe that's how it was done.
01:56:39.920: >> Thank you.
01:56:40.287: >> I can certainly check into it more thoroughly.
01:56:43.323: >> Further discussion of the main motion?  Roll call vote, please, on the adoption of the rules, pardon me, of the rule amendments, starting with the Councilmember Ramlawi.
01:57:00.941: >> Councilmember Ramlawi?
01:57:02.309: >> No.
01:57:02.609: >> Councilmember Hayner?
01:57:05.446: >> Nope.

01:57:26.400: >> Yes.
01:57:27.601: >> Motion carrie
01:57:29.103: >> DC-3, resolution to request the city administrator to determine the cost and feasibility of supplemental snow and ice removal of our pedestrian infrastructure to improve pedestrian safety within the DDA.  Moved and second by Councilmember Briggs. Discussion please of DC-3, sponsored by Councilmember Ramlawi.
01:57:55.963: >> This resolution has come in on the heels of snow removal throughout our city.  This resolution as we talk through it speaks to, you know, our sidewalks, bus stops and crosswalk ramps.  It is tailored to focus on the ADA compliance rules and accessibility.  It focuses on the DDA district because of many different things.  One of them being the partnerships that we have in the downtown area, whether it be the University of Michigan, the business associations, the DDA. It really helps lay out the whereas clauses as to why I'm bringing this resolution forward and not waiting for other resolutions to come.  One is the sense of urgency.  This resolution will again pertain to the DDA district which would be a good pilot program to look at and expand from and scale up if we'd like to do this city wide.  The DDA district is where you have most pedestrian traffic, the most imper VEE I can't believe surfaces. And ramps that become extremely problematic with days like today.  I have gotten an ordinance, our site -- snow and ice removal ordinance and in that ordinance it talks about nonresidential properties. There's a very strict timeframe that businesses down here have to clean up their sidewalks and what you see is most of the sidewalks get cleared here very quickly but then the streets get cleaned and then all that snow ends up in the crosswalks and ramps and every --
02:01:02.182: >> I would like to share with folks what's happened since the last meeting.  Obviously there was a lot of discussions around snow removal and winter access to our sidewalk network.  And we're all coming at it from different perspective.  Some of us have different areas of emphasis.  Obviously as a long time advocate in our community. There's nothing more that I would like to talk about is accessibility.  After that might Councilmember Griswold and Eyer asked me to develop a resolution that would go to transportation commission including the information of what we got and since then I've had conversations with staff and both the DDA and the city staff, community members, community nonprofits I should say.  In terms of SnowBuddy. Work with transportation chair to bring this forward and this is going to be discussed tomorrow night at transportation commission.  So I would agree that there's urgency, there's a lot of different pieces of that.  We want to bring this resolution back for full council consideration in early March. What I would like to ask is that we refer this resolution to transportation commission. We can discuss it all collectively tomorrow night.  I welcome any feedback that comes around this.  If there's tweaks that need to be made to that resolution that is going for transportation commission.  I welcome that feedback.  I've asked councilmember Ramlawi for that already.  I welcome feedback from everybody else. We want to make sure that what gets in front of council is something that addresses the many problems that we have around winter access.
02:02:52.092: >> A second to that referral to transportation?  Seconded by Councilmember Eyer.  Discussion of the referral?  Got Nelson, Griswold and Hayner on the refe referral.
02:03:08.041: >> Councilmember Nelson.
02:03:09.109: >> I'm not sure on how the referral is necessary unless we actually disagree with the premise of having the snow removed in these areas because it would be one thing if it was so overly broad and that it required a lot of serious, like, debate and discussion of where to start but to me the starting point of thinking about this issue and actually moving forward with solutions ASAP is that it is limited and for a very small area of the city.  One in which there are a lot of organizations already invested and already have systems in place.  Yeah, I disagree with the referral only because it amounts to delay and it's unnecessary delay because this resolution is a very small focused one.  So I will not be supporting a referral because I would really rather move forward more quickly and in terms of the work of the transportation commission I think it's wonderful that they are contemplating and pursuing a broader plan and that broader plan necessarily requires a long timeline and I appreciate what Councilmember Ramlawi has brought to us because I've already gotten feedback about how at the  timely and importa is. I am interested in moving more quickly and I don't see any input that is necessary unless it's controversial to want to remove snow.
02:04:46.439: >> Councilmember Griswold.
02:04:51.378: >> I'm somewhat torn about referring it.  If it goes to the transportation commission should it also go to the disability commission and also to the DDA.  The transportation meeting is tomorrow at the same time the chair of the transportation commission has publicly criticized this resolution before we've seen it and so that troubles me that we're sending it somewhere to an organization that has publicly criticized it and we do want it to be a pilot and take place as soon as possible. Also when we look at projects like healthy streets, waste management or how snowplowing is down the DDA area really is different than the rest of the community and lastly, I would hope that whatever we -- whatever plans we have that we don't automatically assume that tax dollars are going to be used for this because we already have some organized snowplowing being done in the DDA area and I would like to see us explore as many outside sources as possible.  Thank you.
02:06:13.326: >> Councilmember Hayner.
02:06:14.227: >> Thanks, speaking to the referral, I'm going to assume that it want to go to transportation commission to be modified before it returns council for another two weeks. This may represent some necessary delay.  I don't know why else it would go to transportation commission unless you want to say, hey, let's do the whole neighborhood.  Let's have Mr. Crawford look at the entirety of our sidewalk networks and if that's the ace case, let's just do that right here at the table and modify that resolution.  If it is going to end up at transportation commission two comments I would share on its way to it would be that -- I would encourage them or us as a body or Mr. Crawford, if he ends up being charged with this us, to look into the various successes that communities have had with crowd-sourcing applications like Ithaca, New York, they do a thing and they say that it's to help facilitate generous behavior in the community and they have an application that they use that's really quite interesting.  Ithaca snow angels they call it and it's much like our fix where we say here's various e various problems in the city. And people respond to those. This notion of crowd-sourcing these behaviors I think is a legitimate one to consider at transportation commission or otherwise. The other thing that I would urge us to look at if this does get sent back to transportation commission is that there is a notification process that happens, really our goal is we're talking about trying to clear our sidewalks off, trying to have a complete transportation system for the pedestrian.  That's our goal, we have to keep that in mind. Even with 300 miles of sidewalks, right?  If our goal is to keep a clean sidewalk network and not be punitive to land landowners, we have a notification process where the tenant gets notified but not always the registered agent of the property.  I would encourage transportation commission to improve our notification to those who don't clear our sidewalks in a timely manner so that it's not punitive but it has more of an opportunity to get those sidewalks cleared.  Last time I sent something to the transportation commission it was never heard from again. That was the plant heights.  So it will probably have no referral from me.  Thank you.
02:08:50.517: >> I would like to call to my colleague's attention, what this resolution actually does. This rolution asks our city administrator for a cost and feasibility.  I'm asking to see how much this actually will cost.  This is not a compreheive policy This woulactuallyelp supplemt her commissions Whether it disabili, whether it's the DDA, and I'm sure the administrator will work closely with the DDA in this case. This does not preclude the transportation commission from doing their work and I appreciate the heads up and the resolution that was sent to us about the work that is going to be discussed.  The timeline on that one is talking to the year 2022 so the earliest we'd actually see anything actionable occur would be in 2023.  Two years from now. Before we actually got anything done downtown.  And I've been down here today.  I shovelled about four hours today.  You know?  Because, you know, I got to make cuts here in my business.  You know what I was doing?  I was shovelling snow. You know?  And so really, the downtown has its own biosphere. We see that with land use.  We heard Councilwoman Griswold talk about healthy streets.  It has its own issues with waste. The DDA is its own biosphere in some senses.  This could be scaled up and incorporated in a more condyle p-- comprehensive plan.  But to stymy this and prefer it to the transportation commission to maybe die in posture is not really something I would like to support. I'd rather get moving on this. We had somebody who died of a preventable death just two years ago near caring town.  We are gambling with people's lives so we can take credit for something?  I'm not sure what the hesitation is in supporting this resolution.  This is very actionable, simple, focused and all we're asking for is how much is this going to cost? This is not spending any money and it just makes sense of all the shareholders that we have downtown.  We have the university.  We have the DDA. It should be done.  And, you know, in concert with everything else we should not have to wait for a more comprehensive policy to come forward first.
02:11:52.732: >> Councilmember Grand.
02:11:54.000: >> Thank you.  I have a couple process concerns which is why I will be supporting referring this back to you.  The transportation committee.  One, I think it was interesting and again I'm speak for myself but it was interesting that I heard counci Councilmember Griswold say if it should go to this place or that place.  One of the things Councilmember Eyer and I are working on is how to bring things to councilmembers before bringing them to the table and how more effective policy conversations when we actually talk to those take stakeholders. It's a little troubling to me that it didn't go to the DDA or there wasn't a conversation with the DDA or with staff in the DDA because I think that would give us a better sense of this. And, you know, is it part of a larger or is it really that small?  On the other side of that coin, if it really is something that is quite small, and that there's an idea for how to make implementation of something better and this is not for me to try to take credit for something but a number of years ago, I noticed that we only had one location for salt and sand in the city and I thought, well maybe we can have that in the parks.  So I didn't bring a resolution to council.  I just talked to staff and said, hey, can we put some salt and sand pickup in the parks and they say sure and so we did.  As a city it didn't require a resolution.  If it really is something that there's just an idea for how to maybe get you know, snow off the ramps better, working with some of our community partners, I don't think that aually takes a resolution from council I think process-wise, some of us are on the DDA partnerships committee.  Have that conversation about how to get the snow off.  I don't think we need a cost estimate for that. Just talk to staff and hopefully we can make things safer.  But I do think -- we just had this conversation about how we want to think about snow on the sidewalks and right now it's in transportation commission.  I think it's in excellent hands. Thanks.
02:14:18.244: >> Councilmember Ramlawi.
02:14:23.449: >> Yeah.  I just -- I don't know where this is going to go tonight.  It really is swimming upstream these last six months. You know, the DDA partnerships committee is an -- we report out.  We get together and each entity speaks about what they're doing.  There is not collaboration and I can't speak with Councilmember Song about forming policies with these other entities.  We can talk about what we're proposing to do or what we just did.  We're not engaging in setting policy. I believe this is more than a salt and sand distribution issue.  I feel this is a council matter, a council policy.  Something I think deserves council attention.  It is troubling what I'm sensing and experiencing here on council is, you know, what I heard referred to as checkpoints.  We have to go through checkpoints and committees and now as an eelected official I need to first go through committees and checkpoints in order to bring resolution to council.  It is troubling that this is the direction this council is going.  That I elected officials don't have the phone lines that advisory boards now have.  And I just want to ask, when other -- if I can ask Councilmember Briggs, what other issue has transportation or resolution gone through this process?  Where we first have to go through a board of non-elected members to get permission on adopting policy?
02:16:26.005: >> Point of order, mayor.  We are supposed to be limiting our discussion now to whether we'll refer this to the transportation commission.  It feels like we're -- off topic here.
02:16:41.487: >> I will take that last point is a reference to the utility of -- to the utility of referrals.  That's in order. Councilmember Briggs on the queue.
02:17:02.174: >> So I am bringing this forward, this resolution to transportation commission at the request of my colleagues, Councilmember Eyer and Griswold who following our discussion -- at our last meeting felt like this would be the best route for us to go.  So this is coming currently at that request.  I think there is benefit about reaching out and doing our work beforehand to make sure that the resolutions that we're bringing to council are achievable.  That -- obviously there isn't a timeline in this resolution in terms of the cost and feasibility.  I would suggest that my discussions with staff had suggested that the current resolution in front of us is bigger in scope than you might suggest.  I think maybe when your thinking about the DDA district is actually -- is you, I'm sure know but maybe others do not, a rather large district.  And so thinking about the cost of feasibility across the entire DDA is maybe broader than what you're interested in specifically. Perhaps it isn't.  I do think that there's absolute merits. We have different partnerships in the downtown than other parts of the community.  The timeline that is in the resolution came after discussions with staff.  Every item that we put forward, obviously, is an additional task upon the massive amount of work that they're already doing.  While we might want things to move more quickly this is the realistic timeframe they believe they can get things done.  July, in the resolution being looked at allows for us, staff, to take a look at review, our current policy, suggest things that may be implemented by next winter. And that -- in the scope of the DDA as well and then an annual --
02:19:01.427: >> Can I ask for a point of order myself.  I would rather be talking about the resolution that is on the agenda, not the proposed --
02:19:09.101: >> Well, councilmember, first off, I this Councilmember Briggs your two minutes were up.
02:19:15.775: >> That's okay.
02:19:17.343: >> Second, the point was I believe in order.  The question is to the utility of referrals was raised and it was in response to that which is germane to whether or not this is going to be referred. Councilmember Song.
02:19:46.405: >> Council member Ramlawi brought up the meeting.  It is on March 10th.  It is what works have -- groups have worked on at the staff level. The assumption is that the work is done pretty collaboratively beforehand. I don't know if Councilmember Ramlawi's referring to the DDA partnership's meeting which is different and not a commission or committee but an ad hoc group that meets with business associations.  That is focused on street closures, so as far as I understand, the snow removal is really here at the council level discussion like we had last month.  I think we would benefit from hearing from DDA members.  And their input and if that can happen at the transportation commission level which I assume it would and I assume administrator Crawford would also contribute to that discussion.  As he always DO does before things come to DDA to our DDA meetings. I can't understand why we need to decide tonight and not wait until this gets worked out on transportation mmission.  So th's m understanding of the DD DDA.
02:21:14.627: >> Councilmember Griswold. You're spoken once on this, is that correct?
02:21:18.163: >> Once.  I think so.
02:21:20.766: >> Councilmember Griswold.
02:21:24.937: >> I want to thank the committee members and also Councilmember Briggs for quickly revising the resolution and getting it on the schedule for tomorrow night so I guess if we could get this resolution, add it on the schedule tomorrow night with the agreement that it would come back within, say the next month after going to the DDA as well, and sort of fast track it as it has been with the transportation commission, I wouldn't have as much concern and I also want to apologize to Councilmember Hayner.  The environmental commission is taking the lead on the vegetation ordinance and we'll have it in place before the grass starts growing.
02:22:12.384: >> Councilor Ramlawi, I'm pretty sure you've spoken twice on this.
02:22:20.459: >> I'm not sure how many times.
02:22:21.894: >> Thank you.  Councilmember Nelson.
02:22:24.830: >> I want to say since there seems to be an interest in postponing it rather than moving forward with it.  Had we been motivated to move forward. Perhaps this could carry this back to the transportation commission at whatever point they decide to do anything with this.  As a liaison on the council on disabilities issues I was contacted about having a special reference to those who have mobility issues and really rely on the spaces between -- in the right of way between a parking place and the sidewalk being accessible.  Particularly the parking places that have been designated as accessible so that somebody, for instance in a van with a lift to get the wheelchair off the ground, it's a real problem and was shared with me as an anecdote.  I don't know how much spots we have in the city that are specifically designated as accessible but I think it would be a small enough number that we could have a policy around really paying special attention to those areas of the city that are blocked by snow in particular.  So good luck I guess.  I hope this can move forward.  Thanks.
02:23:56.321: >> Further discussion of the referral.
02:23:57.823: >> Council member Ramlawi?
02:24:00.659: >> No.
02:24:02.428: >> Councilmember Griswold.
02:24:02.995: >> No.
02:24:04.697: >> Councilmember Song.

02:24:15.741: >> Is -- Councilmember Nelson.
02:24:24.450: >> No.
02:24:24.717: >> Motion carries.
02:24:26.919: >> Do we have a closed session today?
02:24:29.822: >> We do not.
02:24:32.458: >> We have before us the clerk's report of communications, petitions and referrals, may I have a motion to approve the clerk's report. Discussion please of the clerk's report.  All in favor? All opposed.  The clerk's report is approved.  Other communications stay from our city attorney Mr. Postema?
02:24:56.048: >> No, mayor.
02:24:57.416: >> We now come to public comment general time.  This is an opportunity for members of the public to speak to council and the community about matters of municipal interest.

02:26:10.289: >> Call we are the phone number ending in 205.  Do you have a comment.
02:26:15.060: >> I do.  This is Joe Spaulding, I'm calling from Holland.  I wanted to thank Councilmember Ramlawi for his motion to reconsider DC-2.  I think personally and I could be wrong about it but because of the effect.  Some councilmembers have grown to problematic speech and they out themselves on social media.  I do want to apologize.  I'm going to navigate around some swear words.  We do have a bunch of interesting social media posts.  That I think, you know, are pretty good examples of city councilmembers doing this and so we've got this tweet from Councilmember Hayner saying we demand the right to abortions.  Exclamation.  Also ban guns before more of us  our children are killed.  You're doing a favor, hashtag overpopulation.  On Facebook we have stuff like tonight city councilmembers gave us a taste of what to expect.  A complete lack of fiscal responsibility. Can't wait.  I should add certain words are now considered forbidden to use. Free speech out the window. That one is a little ironic.  F word Chase bank.  I'm too old to care about my credit rating and I own my home.  Other takers include real estate agents, health insurance governments, development authorities and of course lawyers, that's a few thousand people in Ann Arbor.  We have what's it like being on city council.  So people complain on Facebook about how you do a terrible job but the whole word, I spend my time making sure our city is sold out from under us to the mayor and his rabid fan club.  What was it like to see disappointment from so many faces when Clinton lost?
02:28:46.678: >> Thirty seconds.
02:28:49.881: >> It seems like the party increase is for creepy Joe. Nice piece on jack and Jane. Keep it up Ryan there's only a few boots left up to lift. They said no, none exist.  I really want to know if that conversation actually happened and what the lady said it did. And the kicker here.  What is Ypsilanti doing to help our affordable housing issues --
02:29:18.410: >> Time.
02:29:19.444: >> -- these are going to be --
02:29:22.147: >> Thank you.
02:29:23.148: >> -- thanks Mr. Mayor.
02:29:26.451: >> Caller with the phone number ending in 476.  Do you have a comment?
02:29:34.426: >> Yes, I do.  Hello?  Can you hear me?
02:29:40.632: >> Yes, we can, please proceed.
02:29:44.302: >> I am not very computer literate and I had some trouble getting on here and I think I missed the agenda item CA-19 resolution to approve the insurance board recommendation to deny the claim subsequent appeal -- claim and subsequent appeal of claimant Melanie Welch.  I am Melanie Welch and I've been sending e-mails to you men and women on city council.  I don't know if you've had time to read them or not.  I'm very troubled by the fact that and I was told it was the city attorney's office that did this.  That they have pictured and -- it's on here too.  They've depicted my claim that it's a contractor dispute. It's not a contractor dispute. It's a dispute with the city of Ann Arbor.  The city of Ann Arbor building department that issues permit passes without an insp inspection.  And then corrupt and criminal builders such as med alert builders use that pass for the permit to prove that they did the work that didn't actually do.  And I've given you all kinds of proof and I have a lot more I can give you.  I find it very, very troubling.  Ann Arbor's my hometown.  I moved to Ann Arbor in 1958 before most of you were even born I would imagine and I always thought Ann Arbor was an honest place.  Good people. You know.  Good government. And I am asking all of you to ask for an investigation for public corruption.  Because I have been asking for years that the city building department and I've also gone up to the city administrators and the city legal department to revoke a pass that they gave on a permit that has enabled Douglas Shelby to a fraudulent construction lien on my daughter's house and then foreclose on it and cause her a great deal of stress and loss of money when she never owed him any money at all.  The city of Ann Arbor has these builders in three different places I found on the city website.  One calling them the -- a contractor partner to the city of Ann Arbor so why is the city of Ann Arbor supporting these builders who have committed crimes against many people. The same crime, many different victims I've been able to locate --
02:32:40.078: >> Time.
02:32:42.847: >> Okay.  Please read the documents I sent you guys.
02:32:50.322: >> Thank you.
02:32:55.427: >> Can y hr me? commt?number
02:33:02.467: >> Yes, we can.
02:33:03.235: >> Hello, my name is Devon Meyer.  I'm an athlete on campus and enrolled in the social work program.  I want to open up and say that we is cities of Ann Arbor are made to wait so long to speak at a meeting that directly affects the public in such a way.  I understand there's a limited in the meeting but there's alternatives to ensure that there are more people who can voice themselves.  Abuse of power and tactics to discourage the public to speak and hold the elected public servants accountable.  I'm here to speak for a nonprofit that seeks to amplify the voices of those who experience injustice, highlight taboo topics and say things that people are uncomfortable to talk about.  Recently it was brought to our attention by a community member that they were wondering what reparations could look like in the city of Ann Arbor.  We were discouraged to see there was no such plan in conversation here.  Despite Ann Arbor's status it has not chose on the address the issues of reparations and assisting its African American community to feel whole again.  An action plan that has worked in the past can be seen in Illinois where they launched a campaign to reparations through a tax on marijuana sales.  This would provide housing assistance for African American citizens.  It has worked in the past with this in mind, I want to pose a question to you, what will you do.  How can we as white privileged individuals of power use this to fight inequality in our city?  Thank you for your time, I yield the rest of my ti time.
02:35:08.593: >> Thank you.
02:35:11.262: >> Call we are the phone number ending in 345, do you have a comment?
02:35:19.904: >> Hello, can you hear me?
02:35:22.374: >> Yes, we can.
02:35:24.209: >> Okay, this is Kitty Kahn.  I wasn't going to call in tonight but my mind is boggled by DC-3. This seemed like a no-brainer. Resolution to request that the city administrator determine the cost and feasibility of supplemental snow and ice removal of our pedestrian infrastructure to improve pedestrian safety within the DDA boundaries.  I've thought this was a no-brainer and -- I mean, this is just asking to determine the cost and feasibility of something that effects our safety.  And it turned into this ridiculous, OI oh my God, I don't know what it was.  First, Councilmember Grand just ask staff like I did.  Next thing, Councilmember Briggs is saying, no, this has to wait until July.  Nothing will happen until next winter. What is going on here?  This is the most mind-boggling thing. I'm just shaking I'm so upset about this.  It just makes no sense.  This is about safety. This is about just trying to determine the cost and feasibility of this.  What is going on?  It's like you guys just want to try to stall everything.  It's -- it's just ridiculous, okay.  Good-bye. I'm done.
02:37:14.452: >> Caller with 556.
02:37:17.856: >> This is Ralph McKEEee, can u hear okay?  I wanted to add to my comments about Gelman earlier and I guess I wanted to focus a little bit on Councilmember Briggs here.  I really fail to understand why there's this continuing undermining of something where the community spoke very loudly and very clearly and unanimously that we should go down this dual path of the EPA. And the state court litigation. I have heard nothing that would indicate that there's an inconsistency in doing that. And yet, you insist on sewing this doubt and giving sort of aid and comfort to Gelman. That's really what's going on here.  If the governor perceives that there's a lack of unanimity in the interveners that will stall this and that what's happened so far.  We could already be in the process with the EPA.  The fed law is currently way stronger.  If you think that the state litigation is going to be better that is a minority and a fringe view here that no one on this meeting or anywhere else would contend that the state law is stronger. Ever.  You might say that the EPA might not do what you want. Or might not actually take the site over.  I get that.  But you'll never know that.  Unless you let the letter go out.  And find out.  If you don't -- if you stop it, you'll be stuck with the state court litigation that's going to take at least a year and a half.  Maybe two years.  Maybe three.  If they appeal and it -- have a do over it could last five or six years.  Gelman is expert in that.  If you go to the EPA, all of that goes away.  So from a substantive perspective, it makes no sense and if you are looking at the -- that somehow it will jeopardize the litigation, you need to say why or the city attorney needs to say why because from an experienced litigator standpoint, I don't see that, I just don't see it.  And you're stalling the entire process.
02:39:54.479: >> Thirty seconds.
02:39:55.713: >> Over a view which really makes no sense to me.  So I really hope that someone will explain this or just stop getting in the way.  Thank you.
02:40:39.323: >> Press star six.
02:40:40.792: >> Yes, greetings, Ann Arbor city council and the mayor. This is Luis Vasquez from the first ward to talk a little bit about the street closure for Conor O'Neill's on St. Patrick's day.  I'm speaking as a public health professional who has studied this pandemic from the start.  I hate to say this but I think it's just a wee bit premature to be having an event of this nature on -- even outdoors.  I, you know, the rates of infection are still high.  We don't know what the impacts of the variants to the disease, agent SARs coV 2 are just yet.  The vaccination program is not in full swing just yet. So I'm just -- I'm expressing my concern.  And just asking for -- if you are going to close the street on St. Patrick's Day for Conor O'Neill's you apply the closest scrutiny that you can and the enforcement of physical distancing measures as much as possible.  And I hope that, you know, the outcome does not derail efforts to have healthy streets this spring, summer and fall.  But, yeah, just asking you to just take a closer look at what's going to happen on that day.  And that it, you know, do what you can to make sure that it's not a super spreader event.  I want to thank you for your time.  Have a good night.
02:42:48.186: >> Thank you.
02:43:00.965: >> 329, do you have a comment?
02:43:05.703: >> Hello?  Hi.  This is Shannon and I am also calling about CA-12 and the approval for Conor O'Neill's.  As I said online, if you are making somebody's name is Shannon with red hair mad about a St. Patrick's Day party, I think you're doing it wrong.  This is way too premature.  Way, way too premature and I'm, like, shaking because everything is -- in this city is about accommodating adults and accommodating college students and -- because they make the money.  I understand that.  But my son can't go to kinkederdern because the case rates are too high.  This is ridiculous.  No child is Ann Arbor public schools has seen the inside of a classroom even those with severe disabilities and needs for therapy.  They cannot see their therapist.  Becse the case rates are too high according to our school board. And then I see city council say that a party essentially for college kids is okay when they are the ones who have made it so that all our cases are so of the casesn Whtenl over half unty areoming from the University o Mhigan students and they're not coming from my kid going on a play date. They're not coming from my kid going to his preschool classes. They're coming from college kids having parties.  Just like this.  But yet my kids and the kids of Ann Arbor are suffering.  And you don't care. None of you care.  You don't do anything.  You say you can't do anything.  You could say no to this.  I don't understand.  I don't understand how I stay here anymore, honestly.  This is not a town that's friendly to children.  At all.  If you can approve this and you tell me in the same day that you can do nothing, nothing to help the public schools.  That it's out of your hands.  That's all.
02:45:51.068: >> Thank you.
02:45:59.076: >> 534, do you have a comment?
02:46:04.949: >> Hello, again, this is Tom Stulberg.  Calling from Lower Town.  I want to echo what the last two callers said.  There's no way I can say it with the same emotion as the previous caller or with the professional expertise of the caller before. But I will speak from my expertise.  I'm a real estate professional and a developer and a landlord.  I have a commercial tenant, a restaurant, not in Ann Arbor. My tenant is able to open up, again, after being closed down. The -- finally, finally this weekend my tenant is opening back up.  I've given my tenant free rent for over a year because otherwise they would go out of business.  And why? Because this is not under control.  We do have a really dangerous pandemic situation. And, you know, I can't -- I'm speaking business which is money and we're all going to survive that somehow.  If not, we'll go out of business and lose a lot of money but not the way in terms of the previous caller did as lives and the impact of lives.  She was so genuine.  I feel I'm ashamed talking about business but it does apply.  When you allow a super spreader event to occur you're hurting people's lives, you're hurting bids -- businesses. I do not think this is a wise decision.  I will talk about things such as expertise.  As a developer, I went before many planning commissions and boards.  It is not a problem for me to take a site plan to city council.  I think it's a mistake if you remove that.  I waited until the end to speak about this.  There is some valid reasons to do it.  One of them is we do not have sufficiently trained planning commission at this point in time.  I would love to see them trained and put the resources into training on planning and zoning matters.  We're woefully lacking in that and before you spend one hundred thousand dollars in conversations spend money on training for the people who make the decisions. Constituents are more aware of your ability to talk to you. And know that -- developers can talk to you about projects that come through.  Generally developers do not talk to individual planning commissioners.  They talk to city council members.  So input from the community is funneled through you to a developer even prior to a hidden planning commission.  That's the root of the voice of the people.  You are the conduit on those to the developer.  Removing that doesn't necessarily and automatically remove you as a conduit but will definitely reduce that.
02:49:12.670: >> Time.
02:49:13.003: >> Your wisdom is necessary. Thank you.
02:49:17.308: >> Thank you.
02:49:26.483: >> Caller with the phone number.
02:49:30.454: >> This is Eric Sturgis calling from the first ward.  I am kind of speechless after listening to Shannon.  I mean, she's absolutely correct and for you guys to just sit there and blankly stare, you should be embarrassed and take responsibility for your poor vote.  The caller who called in about reparations, that was very appreciated.  DC-2.  I was surprised to see Councilmember Grand vote the way she did. She does not like her behavior policed but it looks like she's okay policing other people so I was kind of surprised with that vote.  DC-3, I think Kirk and Mark said it well.  He was gobsmacked and was absolutely shocked that the four people he had worked to unseat were the four people who voted correctly on DC-3.  I think it was said perfectly, I mean, I just don't understand it.  I am suggesting that we listen to Ralph McKee, the lawyer.  I think Councilmember Briggs should go get her law degree so she could advise us more on Gelman plume and her fear on the work that our attorneys are doing. Because seems like all the controversial stuff resolve L -- resolving on people on council. Conor O'Neill's vote was awful. The DC-3 vote was awful and you guys all sit there with that blank look on your face.  So you should be embarrassed. Thank you.  And don't thank me for calling in.
02:51:28.839: >> Thank you.
02:51:38.482: >> K Caller with 464.
02:51:43.687: >> Yes, can you hear me?
02:51:46.256: >> Yes, we can.
02:51:48.859: >> Linda.  Ward five.  I think I heard mind-boggling in one of the comments and that describes how I feel right now.  You guys have spent quite a number of meetings refining the rules so that council can be more efficient and productive.  I don't agree with all the rules but I'm willing to see how the rules you passed are going to work toward that end but what you did tonight is come -- about the snow removal resolution that councilmember Ramlawi brought is unefficient and unproductive.  It's mind-boggling how you turn town a resolution to not just do anything but to direct staff for doing minimal staff on doing snow removal. You put all these bureaucratic obstacles up in front of him going from one committee to another.  It doesn't make any sense.  You try to be more efficient and productive and you could have done that tonight but supporting Councilmember Ramlawi's resolution.  Speaking of mind-boggling.  What's going on with Gelman right now is unbelievable.  The EPA process started in 2016 that looked positive then we put it on hold to pursue a negotiated judgment.  It took four years to get to a consent -- completely unacceptable to all the jurisdictions and all the members of the community who spoke at all the public hearings and now -- and we agreed all of us, to go to the EPA and send a letter.  Then you stalled sending in Ann Arbor's letter then you finally sent the letter and now some of you are working behind the scenes to undo that.  It's crazy.  This is the first time since the plume was discovered that we have all the effective jurisdictions, the representative bodies of those jurisdictions to go to the EPA and our state representative, our U.S. representative Debbie Dingell.  Everybody is on the same page until a couple weeks ago when somebody started working behind the scenes to undo it.  Mayor Taylor, how could you -- councilmember GIZ WOLD for meeting with representative Dingell and people of CARD.  She has been working on CARD since before becoming a councilmember?  It's really unbelievable and Councilmember Briggs, I don't know who you're listening to but you need to go to the archives at the Ann Arbor district library and look at the long history of what's been going on before you say anything more about this topic. Frankly I don't think you know what you're talking about. Thank you.
02:54:52.242: >> Thank you.
02:54:58.115: >> Mayor, I don't have anymore callers with their hands raised.
02:55:03.954: >> Have all these callers spo spoken?
02:55:13.330: >> Five of the seven have spoken.
02:55:16.833: >> All right, anyone who would like to speak at public comment press star nine now.  Seeing no one, the comment is closed. Are there communications today from council?  Councilmember Disch.
02:55:39.456: >> Yeah.  I would just like to say that my understanding of the Gelman situation is very similar to what Councilmember Ramlawi said earlier this evening that back in the fall council, whi I was not on at the time voted to pursue a parallel path.  And the parallel path was to continue with the state litigation process and move forward with the EPA process.  What I read in MLive yesterday was that representative Dingell said that she did not think a parallel process was possible. What that means is that a decision has to be made which of those paths will be prerred?  I personally don't know wha my decision would be on tha because I d'tnow yet eugh about the relativ mets oeach Both look lo.  So I just -- I wanted to say that taking time to deliberate when you have a decision in front of you and a decision appears to be in front of us because what was voted for was a parallel path and that may no longer be feasible. Taking time to consider that decision is not stalling.  It's thinking.  It's deliberating. And many of you who are asking us to be transparent about what we know and what we are thinking at this point probably know full well that there are -- that we can't speak at -- we're not at a point where we can reveal things that we have been told.  So it's disingenuous to call people under the carpet for not being transparent when you know why they're not.
02:57:36.206: >> Councilmember Griswold.
02:57:38.575: >> Yes, first I'd like to apologize to the mayor and my colleagues.  I did share information, communications between the mayor and myself that was FOIA-able.  I did that to get a member about my First Amendment rights.  Not to make that information available for tonight's public comment.  I would like to say that Councilmember Disch is correct in a comment that congress member Debbie Dingell said and that was based on the information that's coming out of our state agencies at this time.  We do need to get all the information but when we insert our legal team into the EPA process and they are only able to report second and thirdhand information that is a mayor problem and so we need to have the legal process and the EPA process which is a political process.  Again, I'd like to invite all of my colleague to follow CARD and to at attend CARD meetings and there they'll get the most accurate information.  Won't be secondhand and there are members from state agencies as well as Congressman Debbie Dingell or her staff member in attendance.  Thank you.
02:59:14.938: >> Councilmember Hayner.
02:59:15.505: >> One thing I'd like to mention is Councilmember Disch and I are attending the Michigan association of plannings training session I think the 3rd or 4th of March designed specifically to bring city councilmembers, up to speed on what's happening with current planning practices and what is the lawful processes. It's basically an overview of what we're supposed to know. It speak to that earlier caller's education efforts and I'm delighted that she's going to join me to take this four our study session and hopefully we'll come back and be able to share our data with the rest of the body.  Speaking to that, you know, once again I'll extend my offer.  I don't make any claims to be an expert on this topic but I spent a lot of time studying it.  If anyone want to study the Gelman issue. I've also been attending CARD for many years and made this my last decade's work.  It's very important to me that we move in the right direction and take advantage of the momentum that we have.  That political leverage that we have at this time and other things and so I'm happy to bring you up-to-date and answer any questions on that.  On this body.  Or the public also. It's an interesting thing because we speak as a body and so, you know, we all have things that we agree and disagree on.  Policy matters. Little ones, big ones, whatever.  I am really sorry to some of the callers that called in and they were quite emotional about their matters before this body and rightly so.  And so, you know, when I stepped out and did not support the consent agenda tonight. Mrs. Welsh's issue.  I did not support the findings on that. If we have somebody that is at legal action with the city that we're not supposed to have those conversations with them. You know --
03:01:29.472: >> Councilmember?
03:01:30.307: >> -- I'm also --
03:01:31.174: >> Councilmember?
03:01:33.009: >> -- notion that I voted to have that block party --
03:01:37.213: >> Councilmember Hayner.
03:01:38.848: >> Hey, there's our rules kicking in.  Awesome.
03:01:43.486: >> Thank you.  Councilmember Ramlawi.
03:01:46.723: >> I'm highly disappointed in this body tonight.  I'm not surprised.  I came in here knowing the outcome of my resolutions.  Unfortunately, I have the thought that that any resolution with the last name Ramlawi on it will not get any support.  It won't get any support for the next two years. It's been made clear that I am damaged goods.  Be -- by many members of this body. This is not good government, folks.  We heard many callers come in tonight, in tears, crying, and in shock.  I brought forward a simple resolution that could have shown a willingness to work together, getting things done, moving things along.  And we heard excuses of why that's not a good idea.  And frankly, they're just excuses.  We're not getting anything done.  You know, people are going to trip and fall and be injured tomorrow because of egos. Because somebody wants credit for something and doesn't want to give credit to a different councilmember.  That's what's going on here.  You know, it is just reckless and bad government and the public sees it.  The public feels it.  The public is experiencing it and the public is frustrated with it.  We have a job to do, folks.  And that's to get things done for this city and get things done for these taxpayers.  And that's not what's happening.  That's not what's happening tonight. CA-12?  In a month's time from now?  We're going to open our streets and have a bunch of drunk college kids?  While students can't go to school? While kids can't go to school? Where are our priorities?
03:03:54.451: >> Thank you.  Councilmember Grand.
03:03:58.054: >> Thank you.  There are lots of interesting accusations tonight and I will try to focus on some other things because I know I just have a couple minutes but I do want to point out that it's not my ego why I voted against some things.  It was lack of preparation and not doing your homework and there'll be -- you can nod all you want.  There are going to be, you know, there -- you know, there's an accusation that we're not getting anything.  I have some really interesting things coming up in the next few months.  Super excited about that.  I do want to speak to, again, the schools and why I supported CA-12 this evening.  I did it because I think -- as we are going to be looking to having our streets closed off in the downtown again that this is an opportunity to pilot what I hope are some best practices that if you have to have a reservation, that if you have to leave your name that there's going to be some distancing. That I really do trust in our staff that they had some important conversations before bringing that forward with an eye to what may be happening. Because we know.  We had outdoor dining and we extended that as a council multiple times last year to enable that to happen.  My concern with St. Patrick's Day is what is going to happen in the fraternity houses and some of these other places.  Those are going to be super spreader events and I personally had a lot of conversations about schools and about vaccination rates because everyday in my day job I meet with 20-year-olds who have been vaccinated and I'm not seeing my teachers being vaccinated and I feel that directly and personally.  And so I want to get our kids back to school safely.  I do.  And I've been having lots of conversations both within committee and outside of it.  To try to offer what we can do because we don't make those policies to help facilitate that process happening safely.  And with good communication to our constituents.
03:06:30.573: >> I want to -- Councilmember Briggs.
03:06:34.210: >> I want to speak to a couple different issues.  One, address the caller who was particularly distraught around the St. Patrick's Day event at Conor O'Ne O'Neill's.  That was an issue I struggled with.  I want to provide clarity around that.  I did speak with the interim director on DDA around that to discuss a little more on their preparation and thoughts going into this.  One of the pieces that made me feel better about the event is we have the entire length of the street that is going to be under -- pretty strict protocols in terms of how that event is taking place. I agree, I think these celebrations that might be happening in other places might be less controlled and I'm hoping to provide an outlet that is much better monitored and I also care deeply about the state of our local business community in recognizing the struggles that they're under. But this does not mean that I am not concerned deeply about our children going to school. Of course, I have a child in Ann Arbor schools as well.  To my Councilmember Ramlawi's concerns that anything with his name on it won't be supported by this council.  At least speaking for myself, that is a pretty outrageous accusation. I'm sorry I disagreed with the items you brought forward tonight.  Collaboration goes both ways.  But simply not supporting your resolution tonight doesn't mean that I'm not willing to work with you on the next resolution.  So I hope that -- I hope that's clear. And then, two, there was -- one caller that was frustrated by the timing of our public r folkwho an't familia - with the process.  It is a little bit cumbersome to speak at the beginning of the might. You need to call into the city clerk's office and reserve one of those.  Preference is provided to those who have not spoken in the past.  And so, that does require a call for those ten limited spots the unreserved time is at the end of the meeting.  One of the reasons we're working to shorten our time and make the committee more efficient is to --
03:08:57.353: >> Councilmember --
03:09:02.024: >> Thank you.
03:09:06.529: >> Councilmember Song.
03:09:08.598: >> I'll just be really brief. Councilmember Ramlawi and I sit on several commissions together.  And it's my home that we'd be able to bring forward resolutions together. We've been able to have a really good working relationship within committee so far and working on important issues.  He helped bring me up to speed on a number of things. I hope it's the case that we end to want knowing that we have a lot of work ahead of us and that there's still room to collaborate on important issues.  This is just the beginning.  So, anyways. Thanks.
03:09:56.412: >> Further discussion?  I'd just like to add a little bit of my two cents.  First off with respect to the opening resolution.  Like my colleagues, that was a difficult one.  The success I think of our outdoor experience over the last summer and last fall and the commitment on the part of the organizer and my confidence in staff and the like to comply with all public health requirements for this outdoor event gave me a measure -- a sufficient measure of confidence I think to the indoors events are going to be the more challenging ones.  You know, the absence of the in-person schools is heartbreaking.  We heard it hear tonight.  Heart breaking and it is one that -- it is -- harmful for children.  Is devastating to families.  It's difficult and risk laden for teachers and staff.  It is an absolutely, you know, it's a weight on our community.  It is a weight on children.  It is a weight on the family and people providing services to
