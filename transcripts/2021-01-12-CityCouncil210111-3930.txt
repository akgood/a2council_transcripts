00:00:47.108: >> Thank you, mayor, tonight we have the administrator starting us off with our comments. Craig.
00:00:53.347: >> Thank you, and thank you, council for the chance to review our sidewalk prioritization methodology with you folks.  We have tweaked it recently so for those of you that have seen it in the past it'll be slightly different and for those that have not seen it at all, may we introduce you to it.  We will now lead the presentation.  Okay, hopefully you can see my screen here now. As Craig said I'm Nick Hutchinson, I'm the city engineer and I will take us through a brief discussion of sidewalk gaps and how we prioritize those projects so first of all, why do we want to fill sidewalk gaps?  So several really good reasons, first and foremost among them being safety.  Having a safe place for pedestrians to walk is better than having them walk in the streets.  And then it fulfills the -- some of the goals of some of our plans such as our complete streets policy, our nonmotorized plan and also the framework even creating a robust pedestrian sidewalk system gives people more options for transportation and allows, you know, more people to potentially get out of cars. So first of all some information here. Just as a side bar here, what we're calling gaps in this case is defined by any locations in the public right of way adjacent to a street that don't have sidewalks.  So those could be, you know, we could be talking about a 50 foot long gap in the network or we could be talking about an entire neighborhood that doesn't have sidewalks. That's all included in that 144 miles that I mentioned there. We have a nice dashboard that our GIS wizards put together for keeping track of this and I'm going to share that real quickly with you.  I have it up on another screen here.  So hopefully you can see that now. As you can see, we have a map here on the left and those magenta lines on that map show us all the places where our sidewalk gaps are in the city. And then on the right we have some data and, you know, some dashboard data about what we filled recently and how much we have left to go.  So going back to my presentation here.  So we've done some very rough high level estimates of what it would take to fill all the sidewalk gaps in the city and it seem to run along the lines of about 150-220 million dollars which is not a small amount of money obviously.  So based on that high cost of filling all the sidewalk gaps, you know, I need to do some prioritization has become kind of obvious so in 2017 staff undertook the first steps to do that.  And we put together a set of criteria that would -- to rate the sidewalk gaps. That would be as automated as possible using our Jew owe graphic information that we have a lot of information and there's two good reasons for that.  One, it's -- would save a lot of manual work by staff by doing it that way and also made it a little bit more objective that way as well.
00:04:54.855: >> Nick?  If I could interrupt we're seeing your presenter view.
00:05:01.829: >> Oh, okay.
00:05:06.734: >> I didn't think we were at first.  There we go.
00:05:09.803: >> Is that better?
00:05:10.738: >> Yes.
00:05:11.372: >> Okay, Jackie.  So we put together a list of criteria here that we wanted to score for sidewalk gaps and they included a variety of things including proximity to various PE dead ethree  -- pedestrian attractors such as bus stops. And the theory being that sidewalk gaps along major roads are a higher priority because of safety and higher volumes of traffic.  Then we also had requests that have come in from citizens and variety of other factors there such as being, you know, whether it's mentioned in the non Mmotorize plan.  And whether or not we had any pedestrian automobile crashes in the vicinity of those gaps.  Then in 2019 after we had been using the system for a couple years we got some feedback from various people. And we decided to make a few updates to the system.  First of all, we took the requests category and we renamed it to evidence of community support. We added some scoring criteria in there for locations where we had obvious desire lines also some people refer to those as go paths so there's physical evidence that people are using that area despite the fact that there's no sidewalk there. Then we also, we made an adjustment as well to account finish cases where we had no sidewalk on either side of the street.  So in cases like that if there's a pedestrian trying to use that area they would have no option if they wanted to walk on a hard surface other than to walk in the street. That gave those locations a little bit more points.  And then finally, we looked at the pedestrian auto crashes category and decided to include a level of manual review by our traffic engineers so that they would be looking -- there's not a ton of these but they would look at the crash reports and in a little bit more detail, and determine whether the crash actually had something to do with the sidewalk gap or not. And then just this past fall, we did a very -- I would call a might be  -- mini update.  We decided to make that pedestrian auto crash category one of the top weighted criterias. So we made a minor adjustment. Speaking of weights, we got all these different criteria, ten in total here and they don't necessarily all have equal weight.  Some are maybe more important than others and so when we set up the system, we went flu -- through a process to weight these different criteria. I am not going to read through all of them but up at the top, that pedestrian auto crashes category came up to the top as well as the community support criteria and I think that's because, you know, if there's more support for sidewalk being built there's more -- greater likelihood that the project's actually going to move forward and then proximity to schools is high up there as well. Trying to keep our school children safe and have a safe route for them to get to school.  So the prioritization system ultimately is really a guide in decision-making.  So where it goes after the prioritization is towards getting things programmed in the capital improvement plan so that those will actually -- can get built and now I'm going to back to this dashboard that we have again real quickly here. And if anything goes wrong and you can't see it please let me know.  But going back to the dashboard and there was a link in the material included in the agenda packet.  This is a publicly available dashboard so you can look at it too by going to that link.  If we go here and look at the tabs and switch to the prioritization tabs you can see here a little bit of additional information and using that prioritization system that we had, you can see there's sort of a bell curve of different categories we sorted them into six categories here with that red color on the left being the highest priority and then that pale blue on the right the lowest priority.  And on the left you can see the map and you can zoom in and out on this map and see the different colors in here what are the priorities.  You can click on these too and see what the actual score is.  It's all relative.  This is a handy tool that our GIS folks created and it is fully available to the public.  So -- switch back here to presentation now.  So after getting the prioritization done as I mention we want to get these projects into the CIP so they can get built.  Some of the larger gaps the more major projects will show up in our CIP as standalone projects. And one of the smaller ones that maybe don't make a good project all in and of themselves, we're going to be grouping those together into an annual sidewalk gap filling program.  So that we can hit some of those smaller gaps in the neighborhoods, pull them altogether into one project and, you know, make better use of our resources by doing them altogether.  There are other ways that we can, you know, get sidewalk gaps filled as well or them I should say.  We have am ojectshat we'reorki od ulity and so what we're going to be doing over the coming years is looking at those projects, looking for places where we do have sidewalk gaps in those projects and if they score in those higher categories, from the top three categories from the mid high to the highest category we will look to include those in those projects so when we're out there doing construction on a water main or road research if asking we have an opportunity to fill some of those sidewalk gaps.  Before we wrap up here I want to say a couple words about the new sidewalk millage.  The purpose of this millage which was passed by November's five voters on November 3rd is to be a dedicated funding source for sidewalk gaps.  It will be bringing in an annual revenue of approximately 1.3 million. And coming up shortly in the next couple months, there'll be some city code changes that will be proposed to modify city code such that we no longer have to do special assessments for sidewalk gap filling projects.  That millage will be the dedicated funding source no longer paid for by assessments and the street, bridge and sidewalk millage which is the millage for repair and maintenance on these existing facilities will no longer be paying any portion of that either.  So finally, just wanted to give a quick preview of some upcoming projects that we had.  The -- we are going to try to get some of these projects going here in 2021. And a lot of the ones on that list are going to look very familiar to many of you.  Such as the Barton Drive project, and then in 2022 the Nixon Paver project is one we talked about a lot in 2020.  A lot of these projects were underway, were put on hold and so we're going to try to get those going first.  There will be on -- next week actually on the council agenda for next Tuesday, there'll be a couple resolutions related to this on there because the new sidewalk millage does not start generating revenue until July 1st this year we're looking to do advanced funding to get some of those 2021 projects rolling. Getting our plans out to bid and then after July 1st, the general fund will then be reimbursed.  All right, that's all I have for my presentation. And I will open it up for questions.
00:14:07.974: >> Excellent.  Thank you very much.  We've got five people on queue, it's 7:14, I would like to be done with this by 7:25 if we can so we can roll through the rest, please. Counci Councilmember.
00:14:29.029: >> Thank you I was sited to hear this because of the changes we made in the last year.  With the new sidewalk millage.  How will the new sidewalk millage change staffs prioritization and criteria used in filling the sidewalk gaps, you know, before we had the special assessment districts and those were really tough to get approved, four resolution.  I'm so happy right now that we don't have to do that.  Will that change the approach, the prioritization and criteria that that --
00:15:04.531: >> I'll jump in on that one, Nick.
00:15:06.566: >> Okay.
00:15:07.067: >> The short answer is no.  The prioritization that we presented tonight is what we have been using for a number of years in identifying gaps.  And also in the priorization we talked about doing gap with road projects, et cetera.
00:15:27.087: >> I'm sorry, the mayor's got us on a tight watch.  Can you explain the cochanges coming up from council that you eluded to earlier.
00:15:37.163: >> The code changes, right now the code requires us to special assess sidewalk.  The code changes will remove that and allow us to use the millage for sidewalks. That's it in a nutshell with the exception of parcels that are exempt from paying a property tax.  They will still have to pay for their new sidewalk abutting them.
00:16:02.655: >> Ali: Has the public system shifted in any way to offer more money and help in putting in sidewalks that are near their properties?
00:16:16.069: >> We have done a couple projects with them and typically what we've done with them is done a separate agreement with them.  For example, the church project between 7th and Main Street they paid for their share of that sidewalk and we'll be looking to do that again with the next phase of the church next year.  So, yeah, they've been a pretty good partner at filling sidewalk gaps.
00:16:45.632: >> All right.  Thank you.
00:16:47.700: >> Thank you, councilmember Briggs.
00:16:52.138: >> It might be easier for the fun l-- public to follow along So it's a great presentation, great to see -- hear this update and I like the new weight -- prioritization with the crashes being at the top issue. Or, you know, top prioritization and weighted heavily.  A few somethings that I would hope that maybe staff might be able to consider in that prioritization model and also in the weighting. Obviously the evidence of community support is great, it's great to see community support but I think there's an equity issue there.  Those that can organize may be more fluent and so there may be parts of the city that can't do that organizing but would like to see sidewalks in their area. So I think it's a little bit -- I think there should be more discussion about whether that should be weighted equally with crashes.  And then I think it's great that there's proximity to affordable housing in here but I would encourage median household income because there may be areas that don't have dedicated affordable housing but taking a look at what the household income is in the area.  I mapped that out during the campaign.  It's easily attainable data by track and historically where gaps have not filled in and folks have not been able to afford assessments might be a better factor to be looking at and then I think it's great that there's classification of the adjacent roadway in terms of prioritizing busier streets first.   think also it might be useful to examine what other transportation goals can be accomplished by the addition of sidewalks along roadways as well for example, Arbor View is one of the ones in 2022. There's a lot of complaints about speeding along that roadway already.  We know the addition of sidewalks there will hopefully do some traffic calming and we're able to hit a couple transportation goals with that addition there but there may be other areas where that weighting would end up differently.  So those are just three factors I was hoping you could look at later and then my question, I have one question, so there's 144 miles of gaps with 150 million to 220 million dollars of project, but we're having annual revenue of 1.3 million so that would take a really long time to get there. Has staff been able to flesh out yet what percentage of those might be covered by future development or have other funding sources or do we need to, you know, how are we going to be able to stretch these dollars I guess?
00:20:03.463: >> Nick I think it's hard to predict to where exactly we might get some of that filled by development.  Inevitably -- it seems like every year we have some sidewalk gaps filled by development so that's a positive.  We also look into one thing I didn't mention in my presentation is we are still leveraging other funding sources to assist in that as well.  The county road millage for example is funding some work as well.  That will go beyond that 1.3 million and we're still looking to use some of our federal aid money as well which we can leverage with that millage money to be able to, you know, build more every year.
00:20:48.141: >> Erica Briggs: I'm wondering if there may be areas of town that might be more fluent that might not rank as high in their assessment when we look at all the prioritization and maybe there's an opportunity to maybe advance some of those projects more quickly if their doing cost sharing.  I'm just wondering if there's some way to get some gaps filled by stretching dollars further if, you know -- I'm not sure that I would even fully support my own idea right there.  Just -- looking at a different scenarios I guess.
00:21:35.955: >> Rah Dina.
00:21:38.257: >> Thank you for your points I wanted to bring those up as well.  I'm glad you brought them up already.  The only remaining question is I appreciate the map that laid out the prioritization levels and wondered if there is data available to us that helps kind of designate how certain neighborhoods were ranked in that way in which areas, you know, maybe they were lower on the priority level than others. In particular, I was surprise I guess when I looked at the map and saw two larger east Ann Arbor neighborhoods around plat that have relatively few if no sidewalks right now on the priority level and I'm wondering I guess if there's data and where they are lacking and similar to councilmember bringings initial question is is it because these neighborhoods haven't organized themselves.  With that being such a high weight would that change the map dramatically. I'm wondering if there's information there as we talk about residents about why there aren't sidewalks in their area and why that takes so long and if we can have something that explains it.
00:22:57.403: >> Nick: Sure, any piece of sidewalk that is scored, you know, there's full data with all the scores behind it that we could always look into in more detai if you needed us to.  We, you know, we didn't -- every piece osidewalk was scored individually.  We didn't score neighborhood by neighborhood, for example.  So some of those places where we see large aas that all rank relatively low.  A lot of the siwalks, they' well within a ridentineigorhood. ey're not near major streets, transit stops or schools. Things like that.  There's nothing to give them a lot of points really.  But if there's specific ones that, you know, you're more interested in, we can dig up some more of that information and see, you know, what were some of the factors that it was not scoring high on.  But --
00:23:52.492: >> Travis: What's available on that dashboard is an aggregate score for that piece.
00:23:57.430: >> Thanks, I will add -- I also do think -- I understand kind of the thought process behind it but I did think it was interesting that kind of a lack of amenities in your neighborhood meant that you were actually potentially penalized further in not receiving a sidewalk.  And so I thought that was something that -- I don't know that it's necessarily concerning to me because I understand the need to have sidewalks around public buildings and things like they I think it can continue to exacerbate that inequity that may exist.
00:24:31.831: >> If we can run it up to 7:30 to give the two of you time.
00:24:37.803: >> Thank you.  I was -- I was encouraged by the map and the prioritization coding on the neighborhood that I had -- it was explained -- when we sat down and talked exactly about this prioritization and relative need and how you measured it.  There's that quite wealthy neighborhood I think in ward two.  That has no sidewalks and when I heard you talk about situations where there's a sidewalk on neither side of the street and that that might elevate the priority, I was -- is my understanding right that the spaghetti bowl that if they don't want sidewalks in that area?  Is that accurate.
00:25:25.184: >> I think that really is going to depend on who you ask.
00:25:28.854: >> Oh, okay.
00:25:29.956: >> In the past when it's come up I definitely heard that people aren't interested in having them but that's going to be a person to person opinion I'm sure.  The lack of special assessments might have an affect on that opinion as well.
00:25:45.972: >> Elizabeth: I share the concerns with the other people that we set up this millage and we have different choices about where we direct it and a neighborhood that has lot of resources and assessments wouldn't have perhaps been such a burden.  At any rate, I appreciate that.  My other questions I think were -- oh, I had one other question which you mentioned in your list of criteria, your list of factors the length of a sidewalk gap longer and shorter.  Did that simply reflect on whether it's a standalone project or is that longer gaps with shorter gaps.
00:26:25.177: >> Nick: The idea there is if you have a situation where you have a neighborhood that mostly has sidewalks in it already and there's one or two parcels with no sidewalk on it that that's kind of an annoyance and so those -- wanting to get those smaller gaps, the true gaps in the system filled, that -- if you look at the weighting on there, that one was weighted I think at the very bottom so it's not a major factor really at all.  It's been scoring.
00:26:59.912: >> Elizabeth Nelson: Thanks that's all.
00:27:01.547: >> Can you share with us where the tool is available so the public can look at it also.
00:27:06.152: >> I will send a TLOING  link to Sarah Higgins.
00:27:13.893: >> Is it available publicly?
00:27:15.428: >> It is, yes.
00:27:16.362: >> I was digging around for it.
00:27:18.798: >> I'm not sure where it is on the website but anyone who has the link can get to it.
00:27:24.236: >> Okay so in the two years that show youed with the prioritizations are any of those tied in with capital improvements and other curb and form work or and so on or straight up new sidewalks.
00:27:38.651: >> Nick: Yes, some of those are actually.  I am pulling up the list here.  Several of the ones on that list are associated with the existing capital projects.  But this -- in this year, this church road project, for example --
00:27:51.831: >> So it's a mix.
00:27:52.932: >> -- there's a couple on that list for 2021 where we're going to be research if asking streets in the residential neighborhood and same thing for '22 as well.
00:28:04.877: >> I'm guessing arbor view fell on there as well.  I know the gaps aren't too huge down there so that would be good.  I had residents on the street that said how come it's not a boulevard.  They want the boulevard back in the middle. Talk about traffic calming. That would work.  In the tool you said it doesn't break the individual scores up but gives the gap that's highlighted. There's one right up the street from me so the woods has sidewalks on the Northside but not the south side and that's prioritized but just down the street we have apple which has sidewalks on neither side, has a bus stop right next to it and also accesses -- they have a lot of housing in that neighborhood and I'm wondering how Johnny woods got on the top of that list and apple did not you said we can we ask for breakdowns on exactly what the scoring criteria was?
00:29:04.470: >> We could dig that up.  We have the information available. All I would say is there's ten criteria.  And, you know, you know, they're -- some are higher, some are lower. There's a lot that goes into that final score.
00:29:19.652: >> We have Apple's in an unusual situation where there's a bus stop.  I see the same person in the wheelchair going down the middle of the street. With crutches going down the middle of the street.  I'm surprised that didn't get priority over Woods.  I will check into it.  Thank you.
00:29:41.140: >> I'm not going to ask a question but given we've had so much interest in this I would like to have an informal discussion because I think there's a lot of detail and granularity and we need to clearly understand this.  We also have public walkways in some neighborhoods that aren't on this map and if we have public walkways we may want to give a lower priority to those sidewalks.  As well as ideas to encourage people to use the sidewalks that they have because frequently I see people walking down the street when they have a sidewalk.  So just an idea for future discussion.
00:30:30.422: >> Thank you.  One thing you heard interest in is inevening equity.  We are constrained in our ability to do things in accordance with inequity.  This may be causing attorneys problems.  If there were perhaps an inverse relationship between, you know, approximate taxable value of parcels and, you know, how that plays -- that is neighborhoods with lower taxable values might weight higher.  Whetherhere's some sort of neighborhood betting on that.  Did you want to tell me what is legal.
00:31:08.460: >> Just to make council aware we got come staff, I think we got a leader on this effort. Working on an equity lens and we're going to have a conversation on what should be included in that.  It will be later this year before we have that.
00:31:26.946: >> Excellent, if you can bundle this in with factor number eleven I think you'll get a lot of support at the table. Mr. Hutchinson, thank you very much.  Mr. Crawford, back to you.  Performance based budgeting.  If we can run this up until 8 o'clock.
00:31:44.163: >> We have the CFO, Mr. Horning here to talk about priority based budgeting.
00:31:49.969: >> Mr. Horning, thank you.
00:31:51.904: >> Good evening, mayor and council, it's a pleasure to be with you here tonight.  I came back to the city in the middle of the process and it's been quite a fascinating process. So right now I'd like to take you through where we are in that process.  I will try to share my screen appropriately. All right.  Does that look good to you?  Excellent.  So first of all, what is priority based budgeting?  PPB is a data-driven process.  It evaluates the budget in terms of currency like we have always done but also let's us look at our budget through the lens of community priorities.  The community priorities that we evaluate or budget on are developed from a number of places including sustainability framework, citizen surveys, agenJgenda and strategic plan.d the budget is broken out by programs in relation to these community priorities.  PPB using lexicons a little different than we're used to. Things we might call activities such as street lights in PPB are referred to as programs. When we go through the process of scoring we use that to develop insights, determine cost savings, potentials to reallocate resources and move funding dollars to those areas that have the highest community priorities.  And finally, priority based budgeting is a best practice in municipal finance as determined by the finance office association. Here is what we call PPB blue print and the first thing to look at is on the left hand of the slide, do we have new needs or do we not have new needs and obviously with A 20DDI community policing and other initiatives we definitely have new needs.  So in order to fund those we need to figure out if we can free up and reallocate resources or need to generate new revenue so the PBB process focuses on that top piece in the middle to find resources that can be realreallocated. Sourcing refers to whether we have to do it in-house, outsource it or do something such as a public/private partnership and finally service levels, can we reduce service level to free up funding that can reallocate more highly scored programs in terms of community priorities.  So once we get through that process, we need to determine whether or not those savings that we found, the reallocatable resources are sufficient to fund our new needs and if not we need to look for new revenues and those can come in the form of fees, grants and taxes and other similar resources.  So I'd like to give you a littletimeline of whe we've been in the process, where we are now and where we're heed.  So in June of 2019, council approved a contract with resource X.  They are the consultant on this project and also provider of e stware tool that facilitates thepress.  Aer at, cy adminisator and counl worked on developing the budget priorities which you'll see in a minute aligned directly with city strategic plan and in the background the consultant and city staff worked on the tool.  And getting it ready for evaluation.  In April, right after I came on board super userers within the city were identified and trained.  This is a small group of folks that will kind of lead the charge in the city.  Following that in June, all city managers were trained and managers scored their own programs.  And that self-evaluation of their activities following that? July we developed cross-functional peer review teams and these are managers, groups of two or three, two to five managers that reviewed the scoring of the managers' self-evaluation and assigned their own score.  Following that, the third iteration was the super users that were reviewing all of the scores from managers and from cross-functional review teams and validating the scoring. From October to December, we had done all the scoring and it was time to move into the next phase and that phase is developing insights in the lexicon of PBB.  So we held three insight workshops with all the managers to develop these insights and the insights are essentially what can we do better?  What can we do more efficiently?  How can we save money?  And here in the green section in the middle, we are in January of 2021 and we're now using those insights to inform our budget process and complement our existing budget p practices which includes the sheets.  I will show you how that works in the presentation. Moving into the future, February 2021 and beyond PBB will be an integrated component of our budget process.  So now I'm going to get into a little bit about how our programs are scored.  There's two different sets of criteria that we use to evaluate.  First is community priorities which I mentioned earlier.  And this probably looks familiar to you.  These are the six major strategic elements that we use in our strategic plan.  The other -- the PBB process called program attributes.  These are a series of cry tier yum that are common across all resourceX clients and I will get into more of these into a little bit more detail here. So community priorities, as I mentioned, these are key elements of our strategic plan. They are the main headings under which all of our goals and objectives fall.  So each of our perhaps was scored against each one of these different priorities.  And when it's all said and done, we can rank all of our city programs based on their correlation to those budget priorities.  So here we've got the first five, the first environment, sustainability, safety and infrastructure.  The length of those represents the city budget and the shading of each bar component within there represents the highest KOR re -- correlation to those priorities.  This is a high level within the tool.  You can also drill down into specific programs, specific activities right down to budget line items and see how each individual component ranks.  You'll notice I had five here but we have six priorities.  Six governments. We thought it was a little too broad of a topic to just cover in one set so we made subsets of governance including exceptional service of health and external engagement.  And here we have program attributes.  These are common across all resourceX clients and they kind of look at things that are common across all governments.  So it looks at the level of mandate, is it mandated by federal, state or local law or is there no mandate and just best practice. Is the city the only one that can provide the service or are there other entities that can provide it.  We look at the self-sufficiency of each program and we also look at the demand for service whether it's increasing, decreasing or flat and then last but not least we evaluate what percentage of the city population is benefitted by each program.  So here again is the entire city budget, ranked according to those cry tier yum.  At the end of the process we went through the insight workshop development process.  It was a series of three workshops, each one was about two hours long.  It included all city managers and throughout the process we developed over 150 insights. Which are consultants said are the most they've seen which is a positive for us.  There's a couple examples here, football parking, smart cities, selling property to generate taxes and fund initiatives.  And tapping into philanthropy and community partnerships.  So I probably would be remiss if I didn't remind you of the financial situation that we are in right now.  You've seen this before. This was in the presentation in early December for the council off-site.  We're currently projecting at a base level of about a three million dollar deficit in both fiscal year 22 and 23.  Fortunately we have a healthy fund balance of 21% right now but without additional funding and cost savings that balance will be eroded down to 4.42% which is below our policy threshold. Looking at another way with 820 fully funded as you'll call that takes our fund balanced away completely.  So I mentioned earlier, we had a talk about where you're going to see PBB and where it's going to shake out in this budget process.  This is in our budget impact sheets.  And for those of you who haven't seen the budget impact sheets before we have our budget with targets and if there's going to be any increases or decreases that are material to the budget we ask service units and service areas to put together a budget impact sheet that identifies the service area, the service unit, what budget is for the current fiscal year and the expenditures for fiscal year 22 and 23 and down below we had them illustrate what changes they plan on making in terms of activity, what fund that's in. A description of the changes. And then we had them let us know whether that's recurring or nonrecurring expense.  And we tie that to the strategic plan as well.  We've done that for a number of years.  This year we added in the PBB matrix designation so we'll be able to tie those changes back to PBB and see how that shakes out. So as we went through this process, as -- with any new process, you know, there's mixed feelings and kind of a slowness of getting buy in when we started the scoring process in particular there was questions about whether there was value in process and as we move through the scoring process and the peer review and particularly when we got into the insight development process I think that most of the city staff recognized that there's some value added in the PBB process.  For me, I think there's three really major benefits to PBB and first would be that all managers get to look at all programs.  In the past, when we've gone through crosscutting measures, each manager evaluates his or her own area.  This way, we get to look through the budget from a number of different perspective that we haven't been able to do before.  And second is that it's a central repository for ideas.  When we've gone through these processes in the past, we gone through ideas and we implement them and we're done until the next budget process and with PBB tool, we have a central repository to collect, store and analyze all these ideas.  And last but not least, as I mentioned in the beginning, we get to look at the budget through the lens of community priorities.  Which we hadn't really had a chance to do in a systematic fashion in the past.  And also the PBB process is not meant to be a project where we go through the exercise and we're done and then we put the product on the shelf.  It's an an going process, it's supposed to be iterative.  Managers can go into the tool at any time and develop and recommend their own insights and assign different costs, factors, changes of methods as they go and it's open the entire time and when we get to developing fiscal 23, 24, 25 budget, it'll be available to us to find deficiencies and improvements that c be made in the budget process.  And with that, I will open it up to questions.
00:47:34.112: >> MajMayor, if I can make one other comment before you take questions.
00:47:41.319: >> Mr. Crawford.
00:47:43.688: >> We do have a single financial challenge in front of us and we go into this time period eac timeo DWOB develop a budget that falls with the polics y approve an there sever catorie of policies.  There an asset replacemen policy.  So in other words we budget sufficient funds for the infrastructure and assets that you have to be replaced and maintained in an appropriate manner.  There's -- there are policy to set aside funds for pension and VEE what as required by the policy.  And there's fund balance policy for making sure that we have adequate reserve to handle the good and bad times and lastly we always try to balance the budget on a recurring basis, in other words the recurring rev SD -- revenue.  And we got a pretty good history of doing this.  I will tell you from my experience, we're looking at it from a fairly tough time here with our budget this year. More than I've seen in the past.  I just want to remind you of that.
00:49:01.766: >> Council member Nelson.
00:49:03.001: >> I would like to look at slide number ten.  I would like to hear talked about a bit -- a little more about the significance of the darker to light -- the darker shading and the higher correlation.  Less correlation.  I guess I just -- I feel like we rushed through that a bit and I do have a question about that.
00:49:27.291: >> Okay, give me just a moment. I'm trying to move things around my screens.
00:49:42.106: >> I had to pull it up because I couldn't find the number.
00:49:47.078: >> Are you seeing that?
00:49:49.013: >> Yeah.  So -- that -- wait, it's -- yeah, at the community priorities.  Yeah, that's the one.  I was curious as you described it briefly my understanding was that this was the darker shade parts of the box would be the ones where the dollar is going more directly to pay for that priority.  Did I understand that correctly?
00:50:14.906: >> That's one way of putting it.  More -- it's -- I think a more accurate way of saying it would be that the service provided is correlated more so with that priority.
00:50:35.660: >> So how did you assess that? For instance, I'm looking at safe, engaged and vibrant. It's a very, very large bar of a dark shade -- the highest correlation and environmental stewards looks to have the largest representation to almost a fourth of the lightest shade which I would infer is the lowest correlation.
00:51:06.324: >> That is correct.  So in terms of the safety and engagement and vibrant community, so most of the general fund is safety services.  It's police and --
00:51:21.239: >> Yeah.
00:51:21.539: >> Those have a very high correlation to that priority. And that skews the results in that manner.
00:51:30.248: >> How do you explain the environmental stewards then? That's sort of my curiosity. This big block of I assume spending or is it programs?
00:51:41.292: >> Right.
00:51:42.260: >> What is the proportionality is it the money spent on programs in is it --
00:51:48.399: >> Well, the environmental stewardship piece, that is kind of the corollary to safety.  So with the general fund, there's a large amount of money that is spent on administration which is general government which may not have a high correlation to SPRI environmental.
00:52:10.955: >> That was kind of what I was curious about.  Is that specific to the sustainability department or is that across other departments as well.
00:52:18.963: >> That's across all of the city.
00:52:23.067: >> Okay.  All right.  Thanks.
00:52:24.869: >> Thank you.
00:52:29.240: >> Councilmember Griswold.
00:52:31.842: >> Kathy Griswold: I want to commend TAF for this priority based budgeting. I've had experience in it and it's more difficult than it look.  While we're a political organization, by using this process that's data-driven it reduces the risk of ideology driven decisions which is something that I've talked about before.  And instills more discipline.  So I want to say thank you for the presentation and also thank you for mentioning street lights as one of your examples.
00:53:09.247: >> Councilmember Ditsch.
00:53:11.115: >> Yep, it's not as a question. I just wanted to point out that one of the program attributes is percentage of the population that benefits from spending. And I think that that is a good thing but there might also be times, say, when we are targeting benefits at low income communities, where that might not be the biggest proportion of the population, yet it might be very important for us to do that.  Such as in the A 20 plan, one of its principles that we're just about to talk about is low income should be a priority. I'm just noting that that -- the -- that -- your program attributes don't look like they have a place for us to acknowledge that sometimes we're not trying to get the broadest bang for our buck or for our service but we're actually trying to provide services to the mos vulnerable.
00:54:16.847: >> That is a very good point. As I mentioned, those program attributes are common across all resourceX clients and we cannot change those.  However, I can bring that up to their management and suggest it as a potential change.
00:54:34.198: >> If I can add to that?
00:54:36.067: >> Please.
00:54:36.534: >> And council, one other thing I failed to mention, when I made my comments is the PBB process is not designed to -- you go through all the scoring and waiting.  It's not designed to say, okay, here's your budget.  It's actually some lenses into how you're spending your money.  So on the slide that was just described, you have now got characteristics of how you're spending your money and that can be compared across communities.  It is a frame WOK that you can look at how you're doing here in certain characteristics versus others. There's not a right or wrong.
00:55:28.152: >> Thanks for explaining that for the prescripted budget.  I might be going off script here a little bit but talking more about what we're looking out going forward here in tax assessments and perhaps of the -- I wouldn't call it a collapse in the real estate market but there will be a correct here in the real estate market.  With that in mind, I just had questions on when we're going to start feeling those affects and how long we might feel those affects for and the state sharing, the state sharing of taxes.  What are we looking at then.
00:56:20.971: >> I know we were supposed to get numbers in October, November, did they come in as expected more or less?  What are we looking at when it comes to the state sharing revenue?
00:56:37.054: >> Okay, I'll take the state share revenue piece first.  We can get updated numbers and those fortunately are based on prior quarters and the news there was good.  There's no increase but it's relatively slack for the coming fiscal year.  The future numbers will depend on sales tax receipts at state level as well as the state government's willingness to appropriate funds for statutory revenue sharing.  So we are in a good spot in terms of state shared revenue for the coming fiscal year, after that, it's a question mark.
00:57:22.666: >> Thank you.
00:57:23.167: >> I'm sorry --
00:57:25.236: >> With the commercial real estate, you know, in --
00:57:29.406: >> Yeah so that's another question -- big question mark typically it takes about 18 months for market values to work their way through the assessing system.  So right now we really haven't seen any adverse affects but we know they're coming.  Once those adverse affects are realized then in the light of sales studies, it'll be about a year and a half before those completely work their way through to changes in taxable value and thus decrease tax revenue.
00:58:08.445: >> Can we tease that out to know what the commercial component of our base is?
00:58:19.557: >> We can give you statistics on what the components are right now.  How it's going to be faced by the recession.  We would need a crystal ball for that.
00:58:30.334: >> Okay.  Thank you.
00:58:32.469: >> Councilmember Crawford.
00:58:34.338: >> At the risk of being a futurist, I will say, when I think of COVID and the impact that it's had on different industries, you can imagine, for example, the payment industry went from cash to payment.  And that accelerated of electronic acceptance of electronic payments of say, five years or maybe more.  I am suspecting that the real estate market hear may have the same affect.  So what may have occurred over the next 5-10 years as far as the price pressure and in the turnover on businesses the ones that are going to make it or not, we may have seen an acceleration of that if the market comes back strong in say, 12 months from now and everything's open and the activity's back, you might have just jumped ahead.  Of course this is a spectrum so you could have less than that if the economy weakens.  You have weakness without the regrowth.
00:59:34.698: >> Definitely another side bar about how that equitable regrowth is.
00:59:41.238: >> Councilmember are you in.
00:59:45.042: >> Real brief.  I wasrying to get a grip on -- Councilmember Nelson asked questions about the graphical presentatn of that data and each of the bars has five segments and you say that each segment represents what now?  Why are they broken into five segments?  That's the different program areas? we ndo do- we needed to establish a criteria to evaluate them on.  If you think about the population served there's no one served between the 75-100%.
01:00:24.314: >> So the segments represent the five valuation criteria.
01:00:30.754: >> Correct.
01:00:32.122: >> So somehow have we been able to ascertain aside from the policy aspects that were mentioned like pension policies or fund balance policies or council directives that we want to focus on, this or that.  So, you know, folks have asked me about things like this where they say, hey, we have 3,000 people say -- just throwing numbers, I think it's more than that.  3,000 people on a housing commission waitlist and that represents 2% of our population or something.  So at least X what of our budget should be applied to helping those 2% of our population? Should that number come from policies?  Council directives? Needs in the community?  A combination of all three?  Is there any way that we can help make those kinds of decisions like, how would something like that be reflected in this graphical representation?
01:01:28.345: >> Well, to be honest, I think that it probably is not.  I think that the PBB process and the PBB tool might be something that would help you evaluate those policies but not something that is going to drive or help -- it could help to illustrate the process but not generate an answer for you.
01:01:51.902: >> Or make a suggestion like the ones way out of line or more here or less there.  It's not designed to do that necessarily.
01:02:00.344: >> Correct.
01:02:01.345: >> Okay.
01:02:01.745: >> You could look at our commending on affordable housing and determine which pieces of those are most aligned.  Are we spending some money within the affordable housing sphere that's not benefitting that population.
01:02:23.467: >> Okay.  Yeah.  I just use that as an example because with the population factor.  When you say fire services they're available for every single resident, right?
01:02:33.677: >> Yeah.
01:02:36.580: >> Okay.  Thank you.
01:02:42.286: >> Thank you very much.
01:02:43.654: >> Have a good night.
01:02:46.190: >> Doctor, the floor is yours.
01:02:49.393: >> Thank you for creating a space to have some conversation on energy criteria and principles.  I will pull up slides here.  I am just going to give an overview of the criteria and principles as a fairly high level and we have some questions for you that we're hoping you can help us refine.  So we'll open the floor for broad questions absolutely but we'd also really, really like to get your feedback and so what we've created here, let me make sure before I come N can you see the A 20 logo?  Fabulous. What we got are initial criteria, this is all draft. These are criteria that came out of A 20, through public comment, through work we've been doing over the past year as well as in discussion with our commissions.  So I know a number of people have seen these and they've been tweaked based on feedback.  So what I want to do is share those with you, get your feedback and talk about how to operationalize them.  Because they will guide us through the decision we have before us. Just to frame it from that perspective, we are work on an energy strategy since three of the seven overarching strategies in A 2 zero center on energy.  This is going to inform what activities do we bring forward for your consideration?  If we write an RFP for a program, what do we need to make sure that we articulate in that RFP, everyone bidding knows they have to align with these core values that this community holds.  They will guide about efficiency investments.  How do we work with our utility?  Who do we target first and the most in those kinds of engagements and of course we want to make sure this is a core ten net of A 2 zero.  We are starting with energy because it is where we have a lot of of opportunities. Really, really fast coming up. But we expect this will transition over to as we think about transportation or our investments in terms of material reuse and recovery. So what we've got before you are criteria, the way we're framing this are these are effectively requirements for investments.  They're proposed, they're all draft, but we would anticipate coming to you with any potential investment opportunity and we would identify how they align with the criteria.  And if for some reason we brought you something that didn't align with the core criteria, we would expect that we'd have to justify why.  Why did we not step up in that space?  And then we have some principles and these are values that we hold that we want to maximize to the fullest extent possible but there'll be times that those principles will be in conflict with one another. So principles, it's not going to always be possible to check every box of the principles whereas for core criteria we hope that most things check the core criteria box.  Let me explain that in a little more specificity.  Right now we're proposing three criteria. These are the fairly immovable things that we have heard from the public and presenting to you for consideration have to be in our investments.  One, whatever we propose should reduce green house emissions. We want to come forward with strategies for that. The second is addition nationality.  I will talk about that in a second.  The concept here is we want to make sure that our investment dollars actually do something. That we're bringing new renewables on the grid, doing new energy efficiency work. We're not quicking someone out of the line because they have a better rating than we don't and we want our investments to be grounded in justice and equity. Those are the core tenets, maybe the heart.  The five guiding principles are resilience, local, speed, scaleable, or transferable and cost-effective.  And we need your help in figuring out some details around what these would look like and what you would like to see if them.  The core criteria, the three we talked about.  I won't spend a lot of time on this but there's more detail on the document.  If we make investments with A 2 zero we want those investments to actually reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  That could be energy efficiency.  That could be big renewable buys that remove gas off the system or coal off the system.  Making investments in local infrastructure.  We want to make sure that we can tangibly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and track that.  Second is that additionality.  Whatever we do wouldn't have happened without us.  The third here that we want our work to be grounded in equity and justice and we want to center our low income populations in this work and that's both in the decision-making and the creation of what it is that we're doing and also in who reaps the benefits.  One of the things we talk a lot about is the contrast between who is hurt the most and the worst from the decisions that have gotten us to the crisis that 're in and flipping that script so that who benefits the most and first from this are those frontline communities. Those who have been extracted from.  This came up loud and clear in our conversations.  We were taking notes during your previous conversation.  And making sure that we think about and center low income populations in this work and that also is about, you know see at the bottom of this, making sure people are compensated for this work as well. It's about working with low income people and creating wages so that people are paid for this work and creating jobs long-term to solve this crisis. The five principles then, the first is resilience.  We talk a lot about this and I know we've engaged with you quite a lot in terms of what we mean.  We don't want the grid to go down. It will.  We want battery storage and how do we make sure our emergency service personnel are ready to go so that in, when, the grid does go down, we don't actually have a crisis on our hands.  Because the system doesn't cascade.  Where we don't have power, when we critically need power and then our service personnel can't get out until we have a bigger situation on our hands than we're prepared to deal with. How do we build resilience into this system?  The next principle is local.  We heard this quite a lot in the A 2 zero engagement that people really do want to have some projects here that they can see, they can feel, they can touch that are inflowing their neighborhoods or folks that they know so to the extent possible we want to maximize how much we can develop locally.  When we can't do that super local.  Then expanding out and so prioritizing sort of as we grow that circle and we have a lot of questions for you around what is local mean to you?  How do you draw that circle?  And I'll raise that in just a second with some team members.  The next is about speed.  One of the things we know about climate change is the area under that curve matters a whole lot so as fast as you can reduce emissions, it's much, much better for the planet and for the likelihood of mitigating catastrophic changes at the center of this principle is how do we reduce greenhouse gas emissions fast and the atmosphere doesn't care where the emissions are coming from but that it is in the atmosphere.  This principle can be in conflict with the one we saw about local and it doesn't have to be but it could be in some investment decisions.  The next is about scalability we've heard repeatedly from council that it is important to find solutions that work here but can transfer to other places like southeast Michigan, throughout the whole state but also the region.  And the nation.  So how do we make decisions that can be transferred, scaled, that our impact can grow fast throughout?  And lastly of course, how do we find solutions that are cost-effective, how do we make sure those solutions are affordable and still align with the other principles that behold and this can be with the other values and I will point out there was a great New York Times piece that talked about solar and you can get some pretty cheap solar and it's generated in workshops in China that are probably using forced labor.  That's a conflict that we will have.  So how much do we drive with cost by itself versus how much are we driving with something else and cost is always an important variable. These are some of the criteria that we have been working through and I want to open the floor now for any general questions and the I'm hoping you'll engage wit us as we ask you so clarifyin questions. Lete jt cse ts out he here.
01:12:29.739: >> Councilmember Nelson.  SNEL when you were talking about slide nine I guess you touched at the end again but you talked some about jobs for the work. Are you speaking broadly and big picture or are you speaking about people you think the city needs to be additional staff related to the work of your department?
01:13:04.607: >> Thank you for the question. I was actually thinking bigger. But yet still specific.  So if we were to write an RFP, what would we want to say about maybe labor practices and a few that we can say or who are the kinds of organizations that we would want to partner with on futures because they share our values around equity and justice or if we were going to explicitly if we were going go out and say we want to build a 400 megawatt renewable energy system, where do we put that and how do we make sure that's centering equity and justice and whoever we work with is paying a living wage in that project?
01:13:45.348: >> Okay.  Thank you.
01:13:49.118: >> Councilmember Ramlawi.
01:13:52.789: >> Are we reinventing the wheel when it come to that issue of paying a fair amount of labor? We already have policies in place with all the other work that the city contracts with -- are we talking about doing something in addition to what's already being done.
01:14:12.008: >> No, the responsible contracting policy will cover those elements.  This was just something that actually came out from our commissions as really -- they really wanted to see it explicitly and so that's why we put that last phrase explicitly in there but I imagine that will be covered in our CP policy passed by council.
01:14:34.297: >> Yeah, if it's any different, please let us know and I was just wondering the struggle that you're trying to stay local but yet tackle this global issue, how realistic is that in terms of being able to invest wisely.  We already just saw earlier this evening that if we incorporated this plan without any change to our budget, we will be in the red within two years.  Where have you seen this in real life the sourcing of things locally have been a challenge?
01:15:22.979: >> Two really good questions in there.  One is from a pragmatic standpoint.  An assessment we did showed about 78 megawatts of potential in Ann Arbor.  We use about 440 megawatts.  We can't actually generate what we use locally.  Now of course efficiency, we have opportunities to lower that number through some deep efficiency but I think it's unlikely that we would ever technically be able to generate everything local.  So one of the questions we're going to -- I'll tee up for you is what does local mean?  Other people define local as within a hundred miles, within 150 millions.  We want to get a sense of what feels right when we talk about what local is. Is it really within the boundary of Ann Arbor in is it in Michigan?  That's sort of one question we would like some guidance on and help thinking through in that investment space and the other about cost. We are exploring a lot of things right now that have very different cost profiles and these principles and criteria will help us figure out what to bring to you.  There are things that are really impressive that can happen here and there are things that are really impressive that can happen somewhere else and we're just -- we're hoping that you will help us understand what is going to align most closely with the values you have because we are chasing carbon neutrality in a lot of different ways.  That was a vague answer.  I am hoping we'll have a follow up.
01:16:58.808: >> At this level I appreciate you being here and explaining and I guess real quickly to respond to that, what local means in this case for myself I think would be Michigan.  We have to deal with constraints? Lansing and there's things we can't do without permission so I guess when I think of it locally in this manner it means in Michigan.  But thanks, I know I got some --
01:17:33.376: >> Missy: Thank you.
01:17:39.916: >> How do the principles align with what they're doing on carbon neutrality.  Do they align at all?  Any I presented the principles to the commission as well. And they are in -- they are in in some ways and not in in others.  We are further in operationalizing.  So we're having conversations that they're having at a little higher level.  So we're able to go in more depth.  But we've shared them with them and I expect if we pass these, they will be going to -- I mean, I will be giving them to the commission in my role as commissioner and saying I hope there's alignment here.
01:18:22.158: >> Thank you.
01:18:23.426: >> Councilmember Briggs.  S SNIGS.
01:18:35.838: >> With regards to your question of what is local?  How do we establish this with the log constraints, the piece I'm struggle around that is in your last example of what we -- what we would need to sustain ourselves and what we could actually generate here.  I think to some degree and you mentioned this little comment, the -- with work on and what we actually need locally.  But but I guess this has to be a real question in our community to recognize that we need to be able to live a sustainable lifestyle.  That that can't -- we can't just not live a sustainable lifestyle but sort of pretend we are by somehow a -- shifting the  that elsewhere and I guess I will just leave it at that.
01:19:50.780: >> Additional questions?  I'm sorry, councilmember Grant.
01:19:55.351: >> I'm not sure if we were moving from the local to the not local part of the conve conversation.
01:20:05.828: >> I don't want to cram -- I don't want to, yeah -- we've been talking about scoring and in ways that we can use land acquisition both within and outside of the city to help with our carbon neutrality goals.  So, you know, part of that vision and some of our other regional efforts to me are at its core an understanding things that we're providing as a city and there are things that we don't want to have say, large-scale farms within the city by design.  So to me, local certainly is within those regional county bounds for sure.
01:21:01.317: >> I'm hearing an interest in maximizing within kind of the county boundary where it makes sense and local can still count within Michigan or kind of two of the ideas that it is -- does that feel okay to folks so far?
01:21:22.238: >> Councilmember.
01:21:23.072: >> Well, I feel like many people come to us, our constituents and say you should be doing this because there is what they're doing in New York because what they're doing in California and it's like, well, Lansing says we can't and I think we need to be honest and fair and use -- know that we're not playing in a little playing field here.  When we have these regulations.  We have these things that we would like to be doing.  And in that sense, I think it's important to make sure people understand that.
01:21:57.340: >> Councilmember?
01:21:58.774: >> I already spoke but I was hoping to focus on policy and law that we can make that can benefit the plan.  By leveraging different assets in our community as we talk about local.  So like it is -- I mean are there things that we can do.  Like councilwoman grand said about the green belt. There's projects going on by is a Ghana where the farmers have leasing reasonable term leases of solar fields on their unarable lands so should we be considering that?  Should we have a policy that we make a council for green belt that says hey, let's put a category in our acquisition matrix that says, hey, is there room on here for a solar lease.  That might make a parcel that didn't score so highly and have more credibility as part of the A 2 zero plan.  I'm interesting in that sort of thing and I know that there's some stuff coming out of planning where we're talking about plan project modifications and some of the developers are using that and are being given a choice.  You can have your PPL, you can choose an affordability benefit to the city or choose an A 2 zero benefit to the city and I hate -- well, those are both things that we need of course but from folks who want to develop here in the community but I hate the notion that we got these two -- are the affordable housing people and the climate people in the same struggle from that developer. I don't want to create situations in our community where we're kind of pitting different legitimate concerns and needs against each other for the same (bleep).  Just a comment I want to make.  I don't know if you have anything to say about that.
01:23:51.654: >> I appreciate the example you gave.  That is a pathway we could certainly be exploring and gets at the tension of what is local.  So if -- that's a great idea.  And if the goal is let's do as much within our region, within our confines that we can then we can run at that.  If the goal is let's move fast andet's get something big and check it off, well I know we don't have land fo440 megawatts sitting idle in the county so I would have to go somewhere else in Michigan to find that and so I'm trying to get a sense of what am I going to bring you next that's going to get you really SDMIETD sit going to be change to the green belt acquisition process.  RFP for a virtual power reemt.  Whi will tell y abo i the next might.  What is this ing that we will bring forward. What you named is important and I think what I heard or want to take back is also a possible additional principle.  Which is co-benefits.  How does this align with other goals and priorities we've established as a policy body?  And that would be like affordable house something how does this align with our affordable housing?
01:25:02.224: >> Councilmember Ditsch.
01:25:03.192: >> I do want to put in a good word for speed.  We are GLOOIND behind, we are already living in a terrible future that hasn't come here yet and I think we need to do as much as we can to make it so people who have off string and offspring who have offspring have even half the benefits that we do now and so while I certainly support us investing as much as we can in Michigan and in projects, Michigan is going to be cloudy no matter what and where, certain amount of the time and there is a certain amount of benefit that we can get from other parts of the country.  And I have seen a presentation I think it was Sam who did it.  And it really persuade me that there is a role for a, you know -- a big upfront push.  To get some numbers down to give ourselves ourselves some time for the lifestyle and to develop things in a local region.  I don't want to spend all our buck but I think that there is a real rationale behind that.
01:26:31.080: >> Councilmember grand.
01:26:34.984: >>.
01:26:35.484: >> This is why we depend on your expertise.
01:26:39.755: >> Thank you.  I want to ask another question too is which is what metrics would you like to see around equity and justice.  What do you want to know?  Just a light softball question.
01:26:59.808: >> Councilmember Song.
01:27:00.809: >> I would like to see what we get in community participation and how we reach out to different community members. If we can see a good variation on age, race, if we're -- I'd really like to see youth participation.  You know, the youth in town are the -- the sunrise kids are -- I shouldn't say kids, young adults are really organized and I'd like to see if there's any way to partner with them.  And I'd like to see if there's any movement for not only having them participate but also give feedback in case we're hissing some kind of either effort or energy or event even in our criteria.  Maybe we're missing an idea out there that we're just not aware of.  Thanks.
01:28:05.341: >> Councilmember Ramlawi.
01:28:07.109: >> Thanks, I think it's a difficult question obviously to answer on the fly here. It's -- first I want to know how much we're paying to get whatever that incremental benefit is.  I mean, I think we have to understand we have very limited resources and trying to get the most out of our investments I think is really important for me at least. There's, you know, unless we're going down river and moving those people out of that polluted area, you know, I -- we're still using dirty fossil fuels and I'm not sure how we go around that.  In a way that will really bring social justice to that -- to bear.  It just -- so I just will just say that how much are we spending to get that?  I think, yeah, we have a reckoning, you know, eventually as a society.  And to making people right for all the wrongs that have occurred but I'm not so sure that us here in this little bubble are going to be able to correct that enormous injustice.  So I just want to be careful as to how far we go to correct 200 years of injustice.  So I -- so that's all I'll say right now. Thanks.
01:29:42.304: >> Thank you for that.
01:29:43.872: >> I'm sorry --
01:29:45.073: >> Just wanted to jump in and make sure I heard that right. You want to understand also the cost for incremental reduction in terms of the investments? Okay.  Thank you.
01:29:57.352: >> Councilmember Ditsch.
01:29:59.087: >> I would love to see a map of energy cost per square foot by household income and property.
01:30:10.933: >> What an interesting idea we are working on a poverty map where people are paying more than 3% of their income which is considered energy burdened and we'll be sharing that with you as part of the equity lens that Crawford mentioned before. Great.  Excellent.  Well I have one moreover arching question and then I certainly -- I could go on forever because I have this wonderful opportunity to get your feedback.  I haven't heard from councilmember rah Dina and I wonder if you have anything to add because you shared ideas previously.
01:30:49.271: >> That's actually why I've been quiet because I've had access to weigh in a bit and I wanted to give my colleagues an opportunity.  I have heard some new councilmembers and I would have brought up the things around equity and make sure we're talking with the right folks to make sure everybody has a voice in the process and I think that's ROEL important. I think that too often we hear from the same people and it's not necessarily always representative of our community as a whole.  So being, I think, intentional about some of our outreach and also some of the areas where we -- where we start implementing some of these things first.
01:31:41.490: >> Councilmember Ramlawi.
01:31:43.225: >> I think we need to educate and inform ourselves as to what we are consuming, how much we consume and how much we, you know, how much privilege we have and with that privilege, the offset, like how much carbon emissions us here in Ann Arbor.  I think it's just a focus more on reducing our consumption.  I think that's the fastest thing we can do is just stop consuming so much. So fast.  You know?  I think there hasn't been enough discussion on that.  I think we've just -- we consume an enormous amount of energy and we're just thinking we can somehow buy ourselves out of the problem and I think we need to change our behaviors.
01:32:39.314: >> Yeah, I do want to name that this is just about efficiency. This criteria will guide decisions around efficiency. How do we lower consumption? How do we start?  A question you raised too, one idea that came up in discussion is instead of targeting our residents do we invest in efficient energy in the park. Well maybe.  We're trying to understand, if I brought that to you as a suggestion and here was the cost ratio and rational of why and we have this program would that be palatable as a discussion point. Those are the nuances I'm trying to understand as we craft that kind of a program.
01:33:30.799: >> Councilmember Griswold. SNIS we need to be careful that we don't in any way shame or act in a punitive member regarding low income individuals.  They'll probably drive older cars that are not as energy efficient and in older homes that do not have greater insulation and have high quality windows.  We need to be sensitive to that. Thanks.
01:34:07.903: >> Dr. STULTS you had another question.
01:34:11.306: >> My question is about how you would like to see these, when we come with a recommendation, how you would like to see these principles and criteria analyzed.  We can do a scoring matrix.  We can just qualitatively talk about the conflicts that exists or the benefits.  What is going to be robust enough for you to look at that and say, I see.  What do you want?  How much do you want to know as we analyze these options and I know it's a big question but any initial reactions?
01:34:43.572: >> Councilmember Grand.
01:34:45.507: >> I think having something for consistency is almost more -- I don't want to say more than what we have.  But what we have is consistent but it's nice for us to have things that we can share with constituents, share with the community.  Why did you support that choice?  Okay, well here's something.  And then if we have maybe some sort of repository of being able to see one after the -- so we can -- I know it's nice when we have different things and I've been involved with scoring where we can say this came in at the 91st percentile of whatever.  But I think having think it has to be, you know, where you can maybe link to something that's more complex if you wanted it or go down that road but Hao having something -- I just feel like yo office is so talented at turning complex issues into things that are both visual and digestible.  So I don't know, you're brilliant at that.  Give us that.
01:35:59.314: >> Councilmember Briggs.
01:36:02.417: >> Yeah.
01:36:05.487: >> I suggest much of what you bring us, if they're options, it's not going to necessarily be a clear win in one area. There's going top sock trade-offs that we have to weigh and figure out.  For me I'm going to need -- I like the qualitative but I'm going to need some clear matrices that haveome good data and number that help support and understand why ultimately one column feels like it's weighing more heavily.  Obviously these come with the staff recommendation as well and seeing that data and analysis behi it areinking to it everybody becae we're talng about sablevestnts for r commityo I think it needs to be supported with strong data.
01:36:58.139: >> Councilmember Song.
01:37:00.008: >> I did my MSW in policy evaluations so if there's any consideration we can do in using the logic model it's a nice visual of saying resources, inputs, outcomes, so if -- I know that social workers have other policy evaluation folks are in town to give guidance if you haven't looked at something like that. But it's just like a nice kind of display of -- if this then what?  So you can get a snapshot.  Thanks.
01:37:40.115: >> Councilmember Hayner.
01:37:42.384: >> So, you may have heard Mr. Crawford's and Mr. Horning's budget presentation there.  I know you're well aware of this. Fully funding the -- some of the A 2 zero type programs is going to require some prioritization of those programs because it's a large investment, a large capital commitment, right?  And so as part of the asking of the various service area heads to, you know, dig into their budgets in preparation for this budget cycle we're in, has the prioritization of the A 2 Zero Projects been also affected by that?  Have you been trying to shuffle things forward backwards or is it pretty much set based on the plan that we approved last year?  How are we going make those constants keep moving the projects forward.
01:38:38.139: >> I'm happy to tee you up on that too.  We did multiple versions of the budget on OSI before.  You'll see more going forward but to get to the projections we did what if.  We fully funded it and we stayed on timeline.  What could we down scale and still have a chance of hitting the timeline, meaning could we outsource one timeline kind of things.  What could we delay and then eventually ramp up and then we have a pare down version as well.  How can we make progress but maybe we'll miss 2030.
01:39:15.143: >> Council takes some responsibility for that by pushing it forward five years, right?  I certainly recognize that and I just -- you know, I know that there is a dilemma. We're doing what we can as a -- we intend to do what we can as a community to head off this global climate disaster but also recognize as other folks have said, and I don't say this lightly although it sort of sounds -- we can do a lot here. We can be a shining example -- shining city on the hill.  A great example for others. Spread that out like you showed in your graphic and give people things that they can put in place right away and run with, right?  I think that will leverage the work that we're doing is going to be critical if we really want to pass that message on that here's a way to do it and also, we can say, it's been working, right?  So not only have we been  doing this.  But stop selling two strokes in the foreign lands and whatever else is going on all other the world.  Things that we can't really effect except by example, right? I hope there's things that we can do as a body leverage of that in these times, thank you.
01:40:31.252: >> I want to name two other things that are potentially optimistic.  I don't have a crystal ball, I'm not a futurist either.  Not a lot of great things happened last week but one good thing that happened last week was a Senate that is much more likely to make some investments in this landscape.  This is a priority of a federal Senate.  The Biden administration has set a goal of zero emissions in the electric sector by 2035 and so we expect the landscape to change quite a lot than what we had before.  We still have to understand what that means. But we are working with the administrator and other municipalities to put together stimulus ask if there is one to invest in these kinds of things too.  We're just trying to be ready for whatever comes down the pike.  So maybe that's -- maybe that'll be good news for news the future.
01:41:26.407: >> Are we in a situation where -- everything that the -- I hope so that everything that the city does and touches right now that doesn't necessarily, you know, include, you know, financing something.  So like obviously we have a bit of an ear for a spark.  So spark does economic development.  They look for different types of companies to come in here.  Can we say, spark, please, we want clean energy companies that do this and do that.  Are we reaching out fully to our community partners in that aspect?
01:41:57.805: >> I think fully is where we'll fall flat.
01:42:00.842: >> We're making that effort is what I'm saying.
01:42:03.545: >> The exact one you just named, yes.  We talked to spark about that but to the extent if you have other ideas, please let us know.  Don't assume that we have maximized all of the outreach.  We still remain a team of six in OSI so we are working with our partners pretty extensively but we need to grow the movement.
01:42:24.199: >> And when you speak to the commission you were referring to the university's commission.
01:42:29.904: >> Yes.
01:42:30.939: >> Okay.  Thank you.
01:42:32.240: >> Mayor, if I can add, so Dr. STULTS has reached out for the larger institutions or players in the city as far as the question about how much have we pushed to -- with partners.  She's created a -- kind of a staff level carbon neutrality committee.  I think we have room as she indicated before we hit fully but we have targeted on that path.
01:43:06.708: >> To save time to let folks know where we are.  We welcome any feedback that you have on these criteria.  The intent is we go to the energy commission tomorrow for formal adoption of the revised principles.  We'll then go to the environmental commission -- they've already seen the principles but we made some adjustments and in February we will ask you to consider them for adoption. And then you'll start to see the conversation around now what?  So we got lots of ideas. We've been working with lots of partners but we'll take these principles, whatever it is that we will land on and bring you opportunities based on those principles for your consideration.  So thank you for engaging in this conversation.  It is meant to get us to the kind of policy resolutions we hope you want to see.
01:43:57.759: >> Yes, I would like to pop one thing and first off to answer of your question of particularity.  How would you like to see them.  I don't know, however you guys think them through.  Whatever matrices you all put together is probably -- probably makes sense and I think wide like to see it.  I think, I'm delighted that we're going to be having a criterias and principles conversation.  Because there are all sorts of good ideas in the world that would be perfect for us.  There are all sorts of ideas in the world that are right for someone else but not for us for whatever reason and I guess to that end, one thing that -- and I don't know where this wanders in.  You know, practicality.  Like the extent to where this is a consideration somewhere.  The extent to where we have self-determination in this area.  Implementability.  If, you know, third party challenges. I don't know.  It's a notion. SNULTS one procedural question based on that too would you like to have a fun energy question where we talk about the options available to you and we collectively discuss the principles and how they would apply and the pros and cons. And the energy strategy we're developing as an office, do you want to come with us in that journey in -- I think it's fascinating but there are really a lot of options before us.
01:45:45.333: >> You know, maybe that's something that we'll chat about in administration and also let other councilmembers of course weigh in.  It strikes me that is probably an energy commission conversation but, you know, before a council conversation, but you know, councilmember Hayner --
01:46:07.255: >> I would because I really enjoyed our conversations we had around forming the community based utilities and since I'm not in there anymore I don't have access to that.  I still feel like we have fallen short by not bringing the ordinance forward.  So I would like to be part of those -- that learning curve.
01:46:29.610: >> Certainly distribution to councilmembers for information in this discussion I think is a baseline.
01:46:37.919: >> Thank you.
01:46:40.121: >> Thank you.  Staff up and down the line.  Thank you very much.  This has been a successful work session.  We were able to move through three very important topics.  With sew later.

01:48:21.756: >> -- here in Ann Arbor have known for months.  Mitigation measures for COVID, many school distributions have beenpen without outbreaks a wcan ofr t choice for studes who remain uncomfortable for students going to school.  The public schools have not offered a choice for families who want in-person school.  They have consistently rebuffed the families to turn the dial for families with special needs. Who have skills that set them on the path for achievement for the rest of their lives.  Ann Arbor schools are an unfortunate outlier.  Other schools have put forth a plan to send some challenge to learning no later than next February.  Even in February there's a return date.  Even after governor whit her stated, Dr. Swift -- in-person but with no dates or references to the announcement. Additionally Ann Arbor schools are consistently leaving their cameras off during board meetings and in one particular meeting there was no response from trustees after over one hundred people demanded a real opening plan.  The silence was deafening.  It appears the school board does not care about their constituents once they are in office.  I feel the actions of Ann Arbor schools in the plan to reopen are ripping Ann Arbor apart.  Governor whit her and the advice of her experts demand a goal and if we do not open by March 1st we lost our way as a supposed educated city.  Families are moving to other cities such as Dexter, et cetera.  This goal -- this call from of the 619 project sums up the PRON problem well.  This is one of the public institutions that are --
01:51:05.586: >> 30 seconds.
01:51:07.021: >> -- of American life.  We've seen how much we rely upon them and how the fabric of the country is unravelling. Although I know you do not have direct control over APS.  I look forward to hearing your public statements about how to do this for our children and our city and how we can achieve this laudable goal set by governor whit her.  Thank you.
01:51:34.248: >> Thank you.
01:51:40.688: >> Miss Bannister, you can unmute your phone and speak.
01:51:48.662: >> Hello, this is Ann Bannister, can you hear me?
01:51:52.700: >> Yes, we can.
01:51:53.801: >> Okay.  Thank you.  I just wanted to thank Craig and Nick Hutchinson for their presentation on the sidewalk gaps.  And I appreciated councilmember's Hayner's comments about the contrast about John Woods drive and Apple Street because one of the factors that wasn't mentioned in the criteria are the -- is the impact on the trees and natural features of the sidewalk of the proposed sidewalk.  And on John Woods Drive there is a long stretch of beautiful trees landmarked trees there at the corner of John Woods and Pontiac that are in the way of where the proposed sidewalk was previously.  So that's -- I want to thank Councilmember Hayner for putting emphasis on that.  How did John Woods get upon at the top of the list when other nearby streets have other more handicapped people and a bus staff and housing in the nearby neighborhood and so -- and then the other factor that I didn't see in the criteria was the snow removal. That not all sidewalks are wonderful if they have a negative impact on natural features and if there's a lot of snow then that has to be removed particularly if the homeowner is disabled or elderly, to suddenly sign them up for a big annual snow removal bill.  That also needs to be -- or should be thought about when you're thinking about the priorities of which sidewalk gaps to fill.  And, okay, thanks, everybody.
