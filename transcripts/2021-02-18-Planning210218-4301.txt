ITEM 6 ARE THE REPORTS FROM CITY ADMINISTRATION, CITY COUNCIL, PLANNING MANAGER, PLANNING COMMISSION OFFICERS AND COMMITTEES, AND WRITTEN COMMUNICATIONS AND I WILL JUST REPORT THAT WE HAVE A COUPLE OF BIG PACKETS OF COMMUNICATION ONLINE FROM THE TWO ITEMS THAT WE DISCUSSED AT THE LAST WORKING SESSION. THANK YOU FOR ORGANIZING IT THAT WAY, BY THE WAY, STAFF. COUNCILMEMBER DISCH DO YOU HAVE ANY REPORT FOR US FROM COUNCIL?
00:03:24.206: >> Councilmember Disch: YOU KNOW, IT TOTALLY SLIPPED I MANY MIND AND RIGHT NOW NOTHING IS COMING TO THE SURFACE OF MY MIND. SO I MAY NEED TO RELY ON MR. LENART TO HELP ME WITH WHAT I HAVE FORGOTTEN.
00:03:38.487: >> Chair Mills: IT'S A THURSDAY. WE DON'T NORMALLY MEET ON THURSDAYS FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T KNOW THAT WE DON'T NORMALLY MEET ON THURSDAYS.
00:03:46.995: >> Planning Manager:  SURE. NO PROBLEM. SO AT THE CITY COUNCIL MEETING ON -- EARLIER THIS WEEK, WE HAD THREE PLANNING-RELATED ACTIONS. WE HAD APPROVAL OF A SITE PLAN FOR A 2150 FREEZE WHICH WAS ST. FRANCIS ADDITION. WE HAD AN APPROVAL OF A SITE PLAN FOR A MULTIFAMILY RESIDENTIAL AT 907913 SOUTH MAIN STREET AND THEN WE ALSO HAD JUST FIRST READING ON ANNEXATION -- RECENTLY ANNEXED PROPERTY, 2731. AND THEN LOOKING FORWARD, AT THE ORDINANCE REVISIONS COMMITTEE AGENDA FOR NEXT WEEK, WE'LL HAVE A PRETTY PACKED AGENDA. WE WILL TOUCH ON SITE PLAN REVIEW THRESHOLDS, T1 -- THE TRANSIT ZONING DISTRICT, ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT, ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS AND PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENTS AS PROPOSED BY THE CITY COUNCIL RELATIVE TO SHORT-TERM RENTALS. SO IT WILL BE A RATHER RAPID FIRE OR CONC MEETING. I LASTLY, I WANTED TO SHARE WITH THE COMMISSION AND I THINK FOR THE BENEFIT OF ANYONE ELSE, THE RECORDING OF THE WORKING SESSION THAT WAS REFERENCED FROM THE 9th WHERE WE HAD A LOT OF FEEDBACK AND ACCESSORY AND DWELLING. IT'S NOW MEMORIALIZED ON VIDEO AND AVAILABLE ON BOTH PROJECT WEBSITES FOR BOTH OF THOSE TWO PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENTS. I THINK I SHARED THE LINK WITH YOU, BUT IT'S ALSO AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE FOR YOUR BINGE WATCHING LEISURE.
00:05:29.498: >> Chair Mills: VERY GOOD. ANY OTHER COMMISSIONER, OFFICERS OR COMMITTEE LIAISONS HAVE ANYTHING TO REPORT OUT? COMMISSIONER LEE?
00:05:40.108: >> Commissioner Lee: SURE, I STARTED THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION MEETING YESTERDAY. THREE OF THE ITEMS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT WERE -- WE HAD A PRESENTATION ON EQUITABLE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT. THE OTHER TWO BIG ITEMS WERE CITY ADMINISTRATION OF SNOW REMOVAL FROM SIDEWALKS. SO THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION WAS IN FAVOR OF PUSHING THE CITY TO FURTHER INVESTIGATE HOW THE CITY COULD SEE SIDEWALKS AS SOMETHING THAT THEY DO IN TERMS OF SNOW REMOVAL. THEY CONSIDERED IT AN EQUITY ISSUE. SIDEWALKS ARE FUNDAMENTAL TRANSPORTATION EDGES ESSENTIALLY. SO THEY WANTED THE CITY TO CONTINUE TO LOOK AT HOW THEY MIGHT ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT THAT. SO A SNOWWAY STUDY WAS SHARED. IT'S ACTUALLY A PRETTY GOOD READ. IT'S ABOUT 60 PAGES. THE LAST ONE WAS PERSONAL MOBILITY VEHICLES. I THINK IT'S MOSTLY AROUND LIKE THOSE BIRD SCOOTERS AND ESSENTIALLY ANYTHING THAT'S MOTORIZED AS TRAVELING ON SIDEWALKS. WE TALKED ABOUT DUTY OF CARE, HEALTH, SAFETY, GENERAL WELFARE ON THE SIDEWALKS AND ONE OF THE DISCUSSIONS WAS ON THE ORDINANCE LANGUAGE REGARDING A 10-MILE-PER-HOUR SWEDE LIMIT WHICH IS -- SPEED LIMIT WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO RUNNING A 6 MINUTE MILE AND THEN THEY JUST SAID WE DON'T WANT TO PUT A SPEED LIMIT BECAUSE IT WON'T BE REALLY ENFORCEABLE. NO ONE IS OUT THERE WITH LIDAR AT SIDEWALKS. SO THOSE ARE THE THREE ITEMS, IT WAS MY FIRST ONE. SO I HOPE THAT'S A SUFFICIENT SUMMARY.
00:07:10.465: >> Chair Mills: VERY GOOD. THANK YOU FOR REPRESENTING US THERE AND BRINGING WHAT'S GOING ON THERE BACK TO THE TABLE. ANY OTHERS? ALL RIGHT. VERY GOOD. NEXT ON THE AGENDA IS ITEM 7, WHICH IS PUBLIC COMMENT. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PERSONS TO SPEAK FOR UP TO THREE MINUTES ABOUT AN ISSUE THAT IS NOT LISTED AS A PUBLIC HEARING ON THIS AGENDA. SO THAT'S -- THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO TALK ABOUT 2385 EAST ELLSWORTH OR 2394 WINEWOOD. TO COMMENT ON ANY OTHER MATTERS, PLEASE CALL 877-853-5247, AND ENTER MEETING I.D. 93953396143. CITY STAFF WILL SELECT CALLER THAT RAISE THEIR HAND. YOU RAISE YOUR HAND BY PRESSING STAR NINE. WHEN IT'S YOUR TURN TO SPEAK, THERE AN AUTOMATED MESSAGE TELLING YOU THAT. MR. LENART WILL ALSO CALL ON YOU BY THE LAST THREE DIGITS OF YOUR TELEPHONE NUMBER. PLEASE MUTINY BACKGROUND SOUNDS SO WE CAN HEAR YOU CLEARLY.

IF ANY CALLERS ON THE LINE WISH TO ADDRESS -- HAVE PUBLIC COMMENT RIGHT NOW, YOU CAN PRESS STAR NINE TO INDICATE THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK.
00:08:46.294: >> Planning Manager:  NONE INDICATED.
00:08:48.597: >> Chair Mills: ALL RIGHT. VERY GOOD. WE'LL MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER 8 THEN, WHICH IS PUBLIC HEARINGS FOR THE NEXT BUSINESS MEETING.
00:08:56.271: >> Planning Manager:  WE HAVE TWO SCHEDULED, PUBLIC HEARINGS FOR THE MARCH 2nd, 2021 MEETING OF THE PLANNING COMMISSION. FIRST IS PROPOSED AMENDMENTS, SPEAKING OF LONG ORDINANCE TITLES, PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO TABLE 515-1, TABLE 515-2, AND SECTION 5.33, SECTION 5.37.2P, THE UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE TO ESTABLISH AND REGULATE SHORT-TERM RENTAL USES.

00:10:10.946: >> Planning Manag:  AND BEEEN THOSEPPORNITIES AT IN PLANNING2GOV.ORG.
00:10:19.921: >> Chair Mills: THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MR. LENART. WE WILL MOVE ON TO 9A, THIS IS REGULAR BUSINESS. THIS IS THE PETITION AT 2385 EAST ELLSWORTH ROAD, SITE PLAN AND SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE FOR PLANNING COMMISSION APPROVAL. AS IS OUR STAND PROCEDURE, WE'LL GIVE THE PETITIONER UP TO TEN MINUTES TO  TELL US ABOUT THE PROJECT AND THE PROPOSAL. STAFF WILL THEN OFFER A PRESENTATION, AND THEN WE'LL OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING BEFORE COMMISSION DISCUSSES THE ITEM. SO AS MR. LENART IS POPULATING WITH THE PETITION AND STAFF, WE'LL GIVE HIM A MINUTE THERE.
00:11:09.304: >> Planning Manager:  OKAY. MR. HART, I THINK YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO ACCESS SHARED SCREEN.
00:11:15.811: >> YES.
00:11:16.077: >> Planning Manager:  AND WHENEVER YOU ARE READY, YOU HAVE UP TO TEN MINUTES TO PRESENT TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
00:11:25.654: >> ALL RIGHT. IS THE SCREEN COMING THROUGH?
00:11:28.323: >> Planning Manager:  YES.
00:11:29.791: >> ALL RIGHT. LET ME -- ALL RIGHT. MY NAME IS HEATH HART. WE ARE HERE. WE HAVE BRIAN FENICH AND KYLE GONZALEZ, THE ARCHITECT AND ALSO STEVE SOCCA THE OWNER FOR THE PROPERTY ALL PRESENT. SO IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS THAT I CANNOT ANSWER, WE HAVE A GOOD GROUP HERE THAT I'M SURE WE CAN ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE. THIS IS A REQUEST -- THIS IS A PROPERTY 2385 EAST ELLSWORTH. IT'S AN EXISTING PROPERTY. THE PROPERTY IS KIND OF -- IT'S ON THE NORTH SIDE OF ELLSWORTH BETWEEN SHADOWWOOD DRIVE AND JONATHAN COURT. JUST KIND OF POINTING OUT THIS AREA. I WANT TO DROP IN, JUST SO YOU CAN SEE THAT THE CURRENT SITE IS KIND OF A MASS OF PAVEMENT AND BUILDING STRUCTURES. AND LOOKING AT THE SITE, TO OUR EAST, WE HAVE GOT A FOREST HILLS CO-OP, WHICH IS THE ZONED R4A AND THEN TO THE WEST AND ALSO TO THE NORTH, WE HAVE A C1 COMMERCIAL ZONING. SO WE HAVE GOT RESIDENTIAL TO OUR EAST, AND THEN COMMERCIAL TO OUR WEST AND TO THE NORTH. AND AS I STATED, THE EXISTING PROPERTY, IT'S GOT A LARGE IMPERVIOUS FOOTPRINT. THERE'S NO NORM WATER MANAGEMENT. THERE'S NO BUFFER TO THE R4 BUT THERE'S AN EXISTING MASONRY WALL THAT SEPARATES THE EAST PROPERTY LINE, LIES RIGHT ON THE PROPERTY LINE, AND WE ARE PROPOSING TO MAIN THMAINTAIN THAT EXISTING MY WALL TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SCREENING. WHEN WE CAME YOU TO FIRST, THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN -- IT WOULD HAVE BEEN OVER A YEAR AGO, THIS IS THE PLAN THAT WE HAD PROVIDED. AND AFTER WE HAD LEFT AND GOT THE ORIGINAL S.E.U. APPROVAL, WE STARTED LOOKING AT THIS PLAN AND NOTICING SOME ISSUES. THE BIGGEST BEING AT THAT POINT IN TIME, WE WERE PROPOSING A NEW BUILDING THAT WOULD LIE ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE PROPERTY. AND WITH THE SQUARE FOOT OF THAT BUILDING, EVEN MAXING OUT OUR ALLOWABLE OFF-STREET PARKING, WE HAD SIX SPACES, AND OUR OWNER AND THE USE OF THE BUILDING HAD A REAL CONCERN WITH ONLY PROVIDING THE SIX SPACES. ALSO, THE CIRCULATION PART -- THE CIRCULATION PAT PATTERNS WAT THE BEST. WE HAD A SINGLE ENTRANCE, A SINGLE SIDED PARKING LOT AND OUR SPACE CONSTRAINTS REALLY DID NOT ALLOW US TO ADD ANY ADDITIONAL PARKING TO SERVICE THE MEDICAL MARIJUANA -- I'M SORRY, THE RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA FACILITY. SO WE HAD SOME CONCERNS WITH THAT ORIGINAL PLAN. WE'RE COMING FORWARD TODAY WITH A NEW PLAN AND THIS PLAN, WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING IS TO RENOVATE THE EXISTING BUILDING. SO WE'RE TAKING APART -- WE'RE TAKING AWAY THE NEW CONSTRUCTION FOR A NEW STRUCTURE, AWAY FROM THE PLAN. THIS EXISTING BUILDING YEARS AGO SERVED AS A LIQUOR STORE. SO IT ALREADY HAD A SOLID FOUNDATION FOR US TO WORK OFF OF, A FOOTPRINT FOR US TO WORK WITHIN TO RENOVATE IT AND MAKE IT WORK FOR OUR PURPOSES. WITH THIS NEW BUILDING, THIS IS 2,533 SQUARE FOOT BUILDING. SO WITH THAT SQUARE FOOTAGE, WE WERE ALLOWED TO INCREASE OUR -- OUR PARKING SPACES TO A TOTAL OF NINE, WHICH IS MAXIMIZING THE ALLOWABLE PARKING, WHICH SERVES A GREAT BENEFIT FOR OUR USE. IT LOSS PROVIDES AN INCREASED CIRCULATION PATTERN. NOW WE HAVE AN AREA YOU CAN ACTUALLY PULL IN, AND THEN THERE'S A LARGE VEHICULAR USE AREA THAT'S IN THE CENTER THAT ALLOWS FOR TURNING MOVEMENTS. SO AS CARS COME IN, THEY ARE ALLOWED TO TURN AROUND. IT ALSO ALLOWED FOR A TRASH TRUCK TO COME IN, AND TURN AROUND ON SITE, AS WELL AS A FIRE TRUCK CAN ACTUALLY BACK UP AND MAKE THAT TURN ALTHOUGH IT IS -- IT IS DEFICIENT IN THE REGULATIONS. WE DO HAVE FIRE DEPARTMENT APPROVAL, BUT SINCE THIS IS LESS THAN 150 FEET, WE ARE NOT REQUIRED TO HAVE A TURNAROUND, BUT IN RUNNING TRUCK BURNING TUG MOVEMENTS, IT'S POSSIBLE FOR A FIRE TRUCK TO TURN AROUND IF THAT EVENT WAS EVER NEEDED. WE ALSO DECREASED -- GREATLY DECREASED THE IMPERVIOUS FOOTPRINT. RIGHT NOW THE NORTHERN PROPOSED LOT SPLIT WOULD BE ALL THE EXISTING PAVEMENT WOULD BE REMOVED. THAT WOULD BE RESTORED WITH GRASS. WE WERE PROVIDING A 15-FOOT WIDE NATURAL FEATURE -- I'M SORRY, A CONFLICTING USE BUFFER ALONG THE EASTERN EDGE TO SEPARATE OUR COMMERCIAL USE FROM THE RESIDENTIAL USE TO THE EAST. WE ALSO INCREASED THE WIDTH OF THE SIDEWALK. SO WE ARE NOT -- WE DON'T FALL UNDER THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE FROM VEHICLE ORDINANCE, HOWEVER, WITH THIS ARRANGEMENT, WE DO HAVE THE CAPABILITIES OF DROPPING IN AN ELECTRICAL VEHICLE CHARGER AND THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE LAYING RIGHT BETWEEN TA.D.A. PARKING SPACE AND THE ELECTRIC SPACES AND THAT COULD SERVE TWO PARKING SPOT, AN ACCESSIBLE PARKING SPOT, AS WELL AS A STANDARD PARKING SPOT. AND THE SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS DO ALLOW FOR THE PLACEMENT OF THAT CHARGER, IF IT WAS EVER DESIRED IN THE FUTURE, AND IT WOULD STILL ALLOW FOR THE PEDESTRIAN ACCESS WIDTHS NEEDED ON A SIDEWALK TO BE ABLE TO MANEUVER THAT SIDEWALK WITHOUT CONFLICTING WITH THE PLACEMENT OF THAT. SO WE WERE PLEASED ABOUT THAT -- THAT CONSIDERATION, THAT IF THE EVENT IT'S DECIDED TO ADD IT, WE DON'T HAVE TO RECONSTRUCT OR RECONFIGURE ANY PARKING OR SIDEWALKS IN ORDER TO GET THAT CONSIDERATION. WE ARE DUAL USING THE PAVEMENT AREA WITH A LARGE UNDERGROUND DETENTION SYSTEM FOR STORMWATER MANAGEMENT. THAT WOULD BE USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH A STRUCTURAL WATER QUALITY UNIT. THAT'S ONE OF THE UNITS THAT WOULD CAPTURE SEDIMENTS AND ALLOW THE PUMPING TO REMOVE THOSE SEDIMENTS. SO WHEN WE DISCHARGE INTO THE STREET, IT WOULD BE CLEAN WATER, AND IT ALSO WOULD BE A CONTROLLED RELEASE RATE TO PREVENT ANY DOWNSTREAM CAPACITY ISSUES WITH THE EXISTING STORM DRAIN. I WILL SAY WITH THAT STORM DRAIN, IT'S IN ELLSWORTH ROAD. WE WERE NOTIFIED ACTUALLY LAST WEEK, THAT THAT IS A COUNTY DRAIN. SO WE SCRAMBLED OVER THE LAST WEEK, AND WORKED WITH THE WATER RESOURCES COMMISSIONER OFFICE, IN ORDER TO GET THE APPROVAL FOR THIS SYSTEM. AND REALLY PLEASED WITH THE LAYOUT AND HOW THIS IS ALL WORKING AND I GUESS NEXT I WILL TURN IT OVER TO KYLE, UNLESS, THERE'S QUESTIONS ON THE SITE LAYOUT THAT I CAN ANSWER AND IF NOT, I WILL TURN IT OVER TO KYLE AND HE CAN SPEAK ON THE BUILDING.
00:20:25.760: >> KYLE, HE LEFT YOU ABOUT A MINUTE.
00:20:27.729: >> THE CONCEPT OF THIS BUILDING IS TO REUSE AS MUCH OF THE EXISTING AS POSSIBLE. THERE'S NO NEW DEVELOPMENT. WE ARE NOT PROPOSING ANY ADDITIONS. THE AWNING YOU SEE HERE IS BEING -- IT'S ACTUALLY INTEGRATED INTO THE OVERALL STRUCTURE. SO WE COULDN'T CUT IT OFF AND REDO IT LIKE WE WOULD IN OTHER FACILITIES. IT'S INTEGRATED INTO THE OVERALL ROOF STRUCTURE. ONE THE THINGS WE ARE DOING HERE IS USING LIFETIME MATERIALS, STONE VENEER, AND PANELS AND HAVE A TEN YEAR, JUST FINISH WARRANTY. THE OTHER PART OF THIS OVERALL CONCEPT IS TO RAISE THE PARAPET HEIGHT, IT MINIMIZES THE SCALE. AWNING AND TWO IT PROVIDES MORE SCREENING TO THE ADJACENT SITE -- WE DON'T THINK YOU WILL SEE ANY OF OUR R.T.U.s FROM THE GROUND BUT ANYONE POSSIBLY ON THE SECOND LEVEL, WE'RE LOOKING OUT FOR THEM. THERE'S -- THE LAYOUT -- THIS AREA WAS CONCERNED WITH SECURITY, AND THIS IS ONE. FEW LOCATIONS THAT WE HAVE DESIGNED A FEW IN THE CITY. THIS IS ONE OF THE FEW LOCATIONS THATE HAVE AN EXIT VESTULE. THERE'S A SEPARATE ENTRY A SEPARA EXIT, AND IS -- IT'S THERE JT AS ANXTRA SURITY PRECAUTION. AND THEN ALL OF THE EXISTINTS LIGHTIXTURES TT YOU SEE ON THE BUILDG, ON TS IMA HAVE BEEN REPLACED OR PROPOSE TO BE REPLACED WITH DARK S COMIANT LIT FTURES. WE USE WEDGE FIXTURE AND W.S.T. AND IAN BRING TT UP IF NEEDED.
00:22:11.666: >> Planning Manager:  THAT'S TEN MINUTES.
00:22:18.339: >> Chair Mills: PERFECT TIMING! [ LAUGHTER ] NICELY DONE. ALL RIGHT. THERE WE GO. MS. DILEO, DO YOU HAVE A REPORT FOR US?
00:22:32.320: >> I DO. I WILL START BY SAYING, I CAN PULL UP SOME GRAPHICS AS WELL, BUT I THINK I WILL JUST KEEP IT A LITTLE MORE BRIEF BUT THOUGH THAT I HAVE THEM ON STANDBY. BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. LET ME JUST GO OVER SOME OF THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF WHAT IS BEFORE YOU TONIGHT. YOU HAVE TWO MOTIONS IN YOUR STAFF REPORT BECAUSE THERE ARE TWO PETITIONS. ONE IS A SITE PLAN FOR PLANNING COMMISSION APPROVAL. I KNOW THAT CURRENTLY YOU DON'T APPROVE VERY MUCH SITE PLANS BUT SINCE THERE'S NO BUILDING ADDITIONS, IT'S JUST SITE WORK. THIS FALLS UNDER THE SITE PLAN FOR PLANNING COMMISSION APPROVAL CATEGORY. AND ALSO WE HAVE AN AMENDED SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE BEFORE YOU. THE APPROVED SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE IS VERY SPECIFIC TO A MARIJUANA PROVISIONING CENTER/RETAILER TO BE IN PLACE IN A NEWLY CONSTRUCTED BUILDING SOUTH OF THE EXISTING BUILDING ON THIS SITE. SO THE AMENDMENT IS TO CHANGE THAT CONDITION TO ALLOW THE APPROVED USE IN THE EXISTING BUILDING. THE STAFF REPORT DOES HAVE A LONG PROPOSED MOTION FOR YOU, FOR BOTH PETITIONS. I THINK THAT MR. HART AND MR. GONZALEZ EXPLAINED VERY WELL WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE SITE IMPROVEMENTS. THE STAFF REPORT ALSO RUNS THROUGH A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THAT, OF -- OF THAT. STAFF REPORT ALSO GOES THROUGH THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE STANDARDS, THE GENERAL STANDARDS. WHICH FOR ALL SPECIAL EXCEPTION USES ARE SUMMARIZED. MASTER PLAN CONSISTENCY, COMPATIBILITY WITH THE GENERAL VICINITY, CONSISTENT WITH THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND NOT DETRIMENTAL TO IT. PARKING. PEDESTRIAN SAFETY, VEHICULAR MOVEMENT AND TRAFFIC ON AND SURROUNDING THE SITE, AND IMPACTS ON NATURAL FEATURES. I WILL POINT OUT THAT I HAVE A -- AN ERROR IN THE STAFF REPORT. A LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH COPYING AND PASTING IN THE PAP  PANDEMID NOT ENOUGH PROOF READING:  THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION UNITS SAYS IT HAS ENOUGH TO ACCOMMODATE 1500 SQUARE FOOT COMMERCIAL PARKING FOR THE PROPOSED USE. THAT WAS FOR THE OLD SITE PLAN AND THE NEW BUILDING. NOW YOU CAN SEE FROM THE SITE PLAN THAT THE CURRENT SITE ALSO HAS ENOUGH PARKING TO MEET THE ORDINANCE REQUIREMENTS AND THUS THE GENERAL SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE STANDARDS. AND THEN SPECIFIC SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE STANDARDS FOR MARIJUANA FACILITIES, THE APPLICATIONS NEED TO COME WITH SOME ADDITIONAL REQUIRED INFORMATION, THINGS THAT ADDRESS THE OPERATIONS, SAFETY AND SECURITY PLANS. YOU HAVE TO ADDRESS THE DESCRIPTION OF ODOR CONTROL, THE WASTE DISPOSAL PLAN, AND STATE THE HOURS OF OPERATION. THOSE -- I WENT OVER THOSE IN THE STAFF REPORT AS WELL. OVERALL, WE FOUND THAT THE SITE PLAN MEETS ALL OF THE DEVELOPMENT APPROVAL STANDARDS AND THE REQUESTS TO AMEND THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE DOESN'T CHANGE OR NEGATE THE PREVIOUS FINDINGS. IN SOME SENSE, YOU CAN ARGUE THAT THE AMENDED USE IN THE EXISTING BUILDING IS PERHAPS MORE COMPATIBLE WITH THE SURROUNDING NEIGHBORHOOD, RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD BECAUSE IT DOESN'T INCREASE THE VOLUME OF COMMERCIAL USES IN THE AREA. IT REUSES EXISTING BUILDING. STAFF HAS REVIEWED -- THE DEVELOPMENT REVIEW TEAM HAS REVIEWED ALL THE MATERIALS AS WELL AND HAS NO OUTSTANDING COMMENTS. THE STAFF REPORT AND THE MOTION MENTIONS THAT WE RECOMMENDED APPROVAL, SUBJECT TO RECEIVING THE COUNTY DRAIN -- THE COUNTY WATER RESOURCES COMMISSIONers' APPROVAL AND THAT JUST CAME YESTERDAY. THANK YOU TO THE APPLICANT TEAM FOR WORKING SO WELL WITH US ON THAT LAST-MINUTE TWIST. AND THE STAFF REPORT, I PROVIDED A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND, WHICH I WON'T GO OVER, BUT I WILL MENTION IT'S THERE. YOU ARE NOT -- IT'S NOT DEJA VU. WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS PROJECT A BIT IN THE PAST YEAR. STAFF IS RECOMMENDING APPROVAL OF THE SITE PLAN AND THE AMENDED SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS.
00:26:49.710: >> Chair Mills: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AT THIS TIME, I WILL OPEN THE PUBLIC COMMENT FOR THIS PETITION. PUBLIC COMMENT MAY BE MADE BY CALLING  877-853-5247, AND THEN ENTERING MEETING I.D.S 93953396143. CITY STAFF WILL SELECT CALLERS THAT HAVE RAISED THEIR HAND ONE BY ONE. CALLING ON YOU BY THE LAST THREE DIGITS OF YOUR TELEPHONE NUMBER. YOU CAN DIGITALLY RAISE YOUR HAND BY PRESSING STAR NINE. ONCE -- YOU WILL HEAR AN ALL TOE MATED ANNOUNCEMENT, ONCE THE HOST IS -- AUTOMATED ANNOUNCEMENT ONCE THE HOST IS ALLOWING YOU TO SPEAK. PLEASE MUTE ANY BACKGROUND SOUNDS SO WE CAN HEAR YOU CLEARLY. I KNOW THERE'S A BIT OF A DELAY. SO WE WILL WAIT TO SEE IF ANYONE CALLS IN.
00:27:48.969: >> Planning Manager:  NO CALLERS CURRENTLY ON THE LINE.
00:27:52.540: >> Chair Mills: ALL RIGHT. THEN BECAUSE IT'S A VERY LONG MOTION, I WILL CLOSE THE PUBLIC COMMENT AND IF SOMEONE SNEAKS IN WHILE WE ARE READING IT. COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL, WOULD YOU BE SO KIND AS TO READ IT OR I CAN DO THIS ONE IF YOU WANT TO READ THE NEXT ONE. ALL RIGHT. WILL DO. SO BUCKLE UP. THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION AFTER HEARING ALL INTERESTED PERSONS AND REVIEWING ALL RELEVANT INFORMATION INCLUDING AN ACCOMPANYING SITE PLAN, FINDS THE PETITION SUBSTANTIALLY MEETS THE STANDARD IN CHAPTER 55 UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE, SECTION 5.29.5. D SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS, AND SECTION 5.16.3. G MARIJUANA FACILITY. AND THEREFORE AMENDS THE 2385 EAST ELLSWORTH ROAD SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE FOR A MEDICAL MARIJUANA PROVISIONING CENTER/MARIJUANA RETAILER. THIS AMENDMENT APPROVAL AMENDED IS BASED ON THE FOLLOWING FINDINGS, ONE, THE PROPOSED USE REMAINS CONSISTENT WITH THE C1 LOCAL BUSINESS DISTRICT, WHICH PROVIDES FOR COMMERCIAL RETAIL USES, AS WELL AS OFFICE AND RESIDENTIAL USES. TWO, ARE THE AMENDED LOCATION OF THE PROPOSED USE WILL NOT ADVERSELY IMPACT TRAFFIC, PEDESTRIANS, BICYCLE CIRCULATION OR ROAD INTERSECTIONS BASED ON THE LOCATION. EAST ELLSWORTH ROAD PROVIDES ACCESS TO THE SITE AND THE PROPOSED USE IS CONSISTENT WITH OTHER SURROUNDING USES TRAFFIC IMPACT. THREE, A SITE PLAN DOCUMENTING THE EXISTING AND PROPOSED CONDITIONS OF THE SITE HAS BEEN SUBMITTED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THIS APPLICATION. FOUR, THROUGH DOCUMENTATIONS SUBMITTED BY THE PETITIONER REGARDING WASTE DISPOSAL, INVENTORY TRACKING, SECURITY AND OTHER METHODS OF OPERATION OF THE FACILITY, THE PROVISIONING CENTER/RETAILER IN 9 AMENDED LOCATION ON THE SITE WILL STILL BE OPERATED IN A MANNER THAT WILL NOT HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE NEIGHBORING PROPERTIES OR AREA. AND WILL NOT HAVE A DETRIMENTAL IMPACT ON NATURAL FEATURES. FIVE, PREVIOUS CONDITIONS RELATING TO TIMING AND DEADLINES REMAIN IN EFFECT. MAINTAINING ESTABLISHED EXPECTATIONS, DESPITE THE AMENDED PHYSICAL FORM AND LOCATION OF THE PROVISIONING CENTER RETAILER ON THE SITE. THIS AMENDED SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE APPROVAL IS BASED ON THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS. ONE, APPROVAL OF THE SITE PLAN TO REDEVELOP THE SITE FOR MARIJUANA PROVISIONING CENTER OR RETAILER IS APPROVED BY MAY 19th, 2021; TWO, A LAND DIVISION APPLICATION TO CREATE THE LOTS PROPOSED ON THE SITE PLAN IS SUBMITTED AND APPROVED PRIOR TO ISSUANCE OF ANY PERMITS OR LICENSES; THREE, THE PETITIONER OBTAINING AND MAINTAINING BOTH THE STATE OF MICHIGAN MARIJUANA LICENSE AND THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR MARIJUANA PERMIT AND PROVIDING DOCUMENTATION TO PLANNING SERVICES BY NOVEMBER 19th, 2022; FOUR, THE PETITIONER OPERATING A MARIJUANA BUSINESS AT THIS ADDRESS BY NOVEMBER 19th, 2022. AND THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING -- THE SECOND MOTION EFFECT LIVE IS THAT THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION HEREBY APPROVES THE 2385 EAST ELLSWORTH SITE PLAN, DATED JANUARY 25th, 2021, SUBJECT TO, ONE APPROVAL OF A LAND DIVISION AS PROPOSED; AND TWO APPROVAL BY THE WASHTENAW COUNTY WATER RESOURCES COMMISSIONER PRIOR TO ISSUANCE OF ANY PERMITS OR LICENSES. MOVED BY COMMISSIONER DISCH. SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL. ANY DISCUSSION OF THE PROPOSED MOTION? COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN?
00:31:24.451: >> Commissioner Milshteyn: THANK YOU. MS. DILEO SO MY RECOLLECTION WAS THE REASON WHY LAST TIME AROUND THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO USE THE EXISTING BUILDING THERE, WAS BECAUSE THEY WERE WITHIN 600 FEET OF BRYANT ELEMENTARY. AND SO THE REASON -- SO THEY DID THE WHOLE -- SO THE REASON WHY THEY MOVED -- THEY PRETTY MUCH CHANGED THE PROPERTY LINE WAS THE REASON -- WAS SO THAT THEY WERE MORE THAN 600 FEET AWAY. OF IS THAT -- IS THAT CORRECT? AND SO WHAT THEY ARE DOING NOW, IS THEY ARE INSTEAD CUTTING THE BACK PART OF THE PROPERTY AND KEEPING THE EXISTING BUILDING IN THE FRONT IN PLACE AND THAT'S MORE THAN 600 FEET AWAY FROM THE SCHOOL? YES. EXACTLY. THE BUILDING -- THE BUILDING ITSELF IS MORE -- HAS PLENTY OF DISTANCE, AND BY DOING THE LAND DIVISION COMING THE NORTHERN PART OF THE PROPERTY, RATHER THAN PUTTING THE LINE SOUTH OF THE BUILDING, THERE STILL IS A CONFORMING LOT CREATED. WE HAVE A SKETCH ON FILE ABOUT THAT. YOU CAN GET A RETAIL BUILDING AND SMALL PARKING LOT ON THE NORTH. SO IT'S A CONFORMING LOT AND IT HAS POTENTIAL. IT COULD HAVE ANY PERMITTED COMMERCIAL USE ON, IT BUT IT COULD NOT HAVE A -- A MARRIAGE A FACILITY ON IT. ONE, IT'S TOO CLOSE TO BRYANT AND IT'S TOO CLOSE TO ANOTHER PROVISIONING RETAILING CENTER. BUT THE SPIRIT AND THE RULES ARE BEING MAINTAINED BUT THE LAND DIVISION LINE IS BEING MOVED.
00:33:10.624: >> Commissioner Milshteyn: SO TECHNICALLY FROM WHAT I BELIEVE I HEARD FROM THE PETITIONER'S PRESENTATION WAS THE NORTHERN PARCEL NOW, THE SMALL PARCEL, WAS GOING TO BE USED AS GREEN SPACE, BUT WHAT I'M HEARING FROM YOU IS THAT IT IS TECHNICALLY A DEVELOPABLE L SO TY COULD POTENTIALLY PUT A BUILDING ON AT PROPERTY; I THAT -- IS THAT CORRECT
00:33:32.946: >> YES. TERM, THEEEDO D THE LAND DISION AND THEY NEED TO REMOVE AL THE IMPEROUS SFACE AND REORE IT TO A MORE VACAN NDITION, BECAU PARNG I T A PERTTED PRINCIP U IN THE C1 DISTRICT. HOVER,TEING A FULLY SITE PLA CLD BEUBMIED I A E FUTURE FOR -- FOR A COMMERCIAL USE BUT THE IMMEDIATE IS FOR IT TO BE A VACANT LOT AND ALL PREVIOUS IMPROVEMENTS WILL BE REMOVED SO IT'S TRULY A VACANT LOT AND IT WILL NOT BE USED CONSISTENT WITH THE ZONING.
00:34:16.390: >> Commissioner Milshteyn: OKAY. SO I WOULD LIKE THE COMMISSION, AS WE'RE HAVING A CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS, TO DISCUSS THAT. KNOWING THAT THAT -- THERE'S A POTENTIAL THAT THAT PROPERTY COULD BE DEVELOPED. I BELIEVE WE HAD A CONVERSATION, YOU KNOW, WHEN THIS WAS BEFORE US, THAT THIS IS SORT OF WORKING -- ACTUALLY, IT'S NOT WORKING THE SYSTEM. I DON'T KNOW THE EXACT TERMINOLOGY THAT I WOULD USE, BUT IT'S SORT OF LIKE GOING AROUND WHAT -- YOU KNOW, AROUND THE 600 FEET FROM THE SCHOOL, CRITERIA THAT WE HAVE. SO I FEEL LIKE THIS IS NOW, YOU KNOW, SO HERE THEY ARE, CUTTING OFF THE NORTHERN PARCEL. WE HAVE NO GUARANTEE THAT THAT IS GOING TO REMAIN A -- YOU KNOW, IT COULD BE DEVELOPED INTO ANOTHER BUILDING. SO WHAT WE'RE CURRENTLY SEEING AS A GRASSY AREA, THAT MIGHT GO AWAY. SO I WOULD LIKE TO -- I WOULD LIKE TO GET FEEDBACK FROM OTHER COMMISSIONERS AS THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT THIS ITEM. THANK YOU.
00:35:22.990: >> Chair Mills: MR. LENART?
00:35:23.590: >> Planning Manager:  PLANNER DILEO. I WANTED TO CELT THE SCALE ON -- SET THE SCALE ON THE DISTANCE REQUIREMENT. TO BE FAIR WHEN WE FIRST LOOKED AT THIS PARCEL -- WELL, LET ME BACK UP. THE CITY HAS TWO PUBLIC MAPPING SYSTEMS. ONE OF OUR MAPPING SYSTEMS SHOWED THAT IT DID MEET THE SEPARATION, AND ANOTHER ONE SHOWED THAT IT DID NOT MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE SITUATION. AND BASED ON THE MARGIN FOR ERROR AND TO BE CLEAR THAT MEASURE WAS WITHIN ONE FOOT. IT WAS, YOU KNOW, BETWEEN THE LAST FOOT  OF THE REQUIREMENT. BECAUSE OF WHAT I LEARNED THEN TO BE THE MARGIN OF ERROR, FRANKLY, FOR MEASURING BASED ON THOSE TOOLS, THAT'S WHAT ULTIMATELY NECESSITATED OUR CONTACT OF THE PETITIONER LETTING THEM KNOW THAT THEY WOULD NOT MEET IT WITHOUT CLEAR DOCUMENTATION OF THAT -- THEY NEED A BROADER SURVEY OF VARIOUS PARCELS. BECABECAUSE I COULD NOT RELIABLY CONCLUDE THAT. I TOTALLY AGREE WITH, YOU KNOW, HOW YOU HE REQUEST WHY THIS WAS HAPPENING, COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN, AND PLANNER DILEO IS ABSOLUTELY ACCURATE, BUT I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT IT WAS AWFULLY CLOSE WITHOUT THIS FROM THE DIMENSIONS. I DON'T WANT YOU TO GO ON THE SORT OF PREMISE THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE MAJORITY OF THAT PROPERTY IS NECESSARY TO MEET THAT SEPARATION. IT'S NOT. IT WAS AWFULLY CLOSE TO THE CORNER OF THAT EXISTING ONE. I COULDN'T CONCLUDE THAT IT WAS COMPLIANT WITHOUT IT. WITH THIS DIVISION, IT'S CLEARLY COMPLIANT. I WANTED TO SET THAT STAGE, BUT I TOTALLY AGREE WITH THE POINT. OUR INTENTION WAS FOR THE TIME BEING TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS USE DID NOT FRANKLY CREEP IN THAT AREA OUT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THAT, BUT LONG TERM, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN BUT IT WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH THE SITE PLAN.
00:37:24.511: >> Chair Mills: THANK YOU FOR THAT CLARIFICATION. COMMISSIONER CLARK, I SAW YOUR HAND UP BEFORE. WAS THAT BY ACCIDENT? I'M TRYING TO READ YOUR LIPS ASSUMING, YEAH, YOU DON'T WANT TO TALK.
00:37:38.392: >> Commissioner Clarke: MY HAND IS NOT UP.
00:37:40.160: >> Chair Mills: ANY OTHER COMMISSIONERS? HAVE COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS OR WANT TO SAY -- COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN UP? COMMISSIONER DISCH?
00:37:50.737: >> Councilmember Disch: YES, I WANT TO TAKE COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN UP, BECAUSE MY MAIN QUESTION -- MY TWO MAIN QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS PROJECT WERE, WHAT IS ANTICIPATED FOR THE VACANT LOT, AND I SUPPOSE THE ANSWER COULD BE NOTHING IS ANTICIPATED AT THE MOMENT. WE JUST HAD A DISCUSSION OF WHAT IS POSSIBLE AND YOU MENTIONED IN THE REPORT THAT SEVERAL RESIDENTS HAVE WRITTEN TO OPPOSE THE PROPROSED USE. THOSE WERE INCLUDED IN OUR PACKET THIS TIME AROUND. I WONDERED IF YOU COULD SUMMARIZE SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS. I GLEAN FROM THE PRESENTATION OF THE PROPOSAL THAT SECURITY WAS AMONG THEM, AND THAT THAT CONCERN HAS BEEN ADDRESSED A LITTLE BIT AS MUCH AS IT CAN BE, THE INFORMATION DIVULGED TO US AND THE REST WILL BE GIVEN TO THE STATE BUT WE DON'T MAKE ALL OF THAT PUBLIC BECAUSE WE DO NOT WANT TO ASSIST DANNY OCEAN IN PLANNING A HEIST. SO WE WILL NOT ASK ANY MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT SECURITY BUT I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR ABOUT OBJECTIONS AND IF THERE ARE ANY EXISTING PLANS FOR THAT DEVELOP DEVELOPABLE LOT. I KIND OF SEE THAT THERE'S NOT MUCH THAT WE CAN DO ABOUT IT NECESSARILY, BUT I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR WHAT EVER ANYBODY WANTS TO SAY.
00:39:30.003: >> I CAN ADDRESS SOME OF THE QUESTIONS FROM THE ORIGINAL SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE AND I CAN LET THE OWNER OF THE DESIGN TEAM. I WOULD SUSPECT THERE'S NO PLEAD PLANS FOR THE FUTURE USE OF THE LOT. FROM THE ORIGINAL SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE PUBLIC HEARING. THE NEIGHBORHOOD -- I CAN SUMMARIZE IT BY SAYING, THEY SEEM TO BE APPRECIATIVE, ACTUALLY OF THIS CURRENT OWNER TAKING OVER THE PROPERTY. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THERE WAS A LOT OF CONFLICT AND THE FORMER LIQUOR LOTTO DELI WAS SORT OF A NUISANCE. IT BECAME A HANGOUT. IT WAS NOT A BRIGHT SPOT OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD. AND I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF DESIRE PATHS THAT CUT ACROSS THE NEIGHBORHOOD, COULD. ING TO THIS SITE. I THINK THAT THE CURRENT USE OF THE SITE LITERALLY CLEANED IT UP A BIT. IT REMOVED SOME OF THAT ATTRACTIVE NUISANCE ELEMENT, I BELIEVE AND IT'S PHYSICALLY A NICER SPOT. AND THEY EXPRESSED AN APPRECIATION OF IT. BUT THEIR MAIN CONCERN IS THEY DID NOT WANT A MEDICAL MARIJUANA OR RETAIL FACILITY IN SUCH PROXIMITY TO SO MUCH HOUSING. THEY JUST THEY FELT IT WOULD BE A BAD INFLUENCE ON THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND IT WOULD MAKE THINGS TOO ACCESSIBLE AND TOO EASY AND SEND THE WRONG MESSAGE FOR THE NEIGHBORHOOD. VERY VALID CONCERNS, BUT FROM OUR OTHER FACILITIES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD -- AND -- BUT I HAVE TO SAY, THERE WAS AN EQUAL NUMBER OF PERSONS IN SUPPORT PROVISIONING CENTER AND THE RETAILER, TALKING ABOUT HOW THEY WOULD APPRECIATE THIS SERVICE SO CLOSE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. THEY ARE PATIENTS OR RECREATIONAL USERS. AND SO IT WAS ACTUALLY ALMOST A 50/50 PUBLIC HEARING. AND YOU DIDN'T ASK, IF THE AMENDED SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE IS NOT APPROVED, THE CURRENT SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE WOULD STILL REMAIN. IT IS NOT INVALIDATED -- MAY OR MAY NOT BE THE RIGHT WORD.
00:41:58.685: >> Chair Mills: THERE'S STILL THE OUTSTANDING QUESTION ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENT TEAM'S PLAN, IS THAT -- IS ANYONE FROM THE DEVELOPMENT TEAM WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO THAT?
00:42:08.928: >> I CAN TALK TO THAT BRIEFLY. THERE ARE NO PLANS CURRENTLY FOR THAT LOT. IT'S JUST A GRASSED AREA FOR NOW. THERE WAS A PLAN THAT WAS PROPOSED TO DEMONSTRATE HOW A BUSINESS COULD BE PLACED THERE, BUT THERE IS NO PLANS FOR A BUSINESS TO BE PLACED IN THAT AREA.
00:42:36.222: >> Councilmember Disch: DO I GET ONE FOLLOW-UP?
00:42:40.060: >> Chair Mills: ABSOLUTELY.
00:42:40.727: >> Councilmember Disch: OKAY.
00:42:41.361: >> Chair Mills: WE DON'T HAVE THE SAME TIME LIMITS, I THINK THAT -- [ LAUGHTER ]
00:42:46.066: >> Councilmember Disch: THANK YOU FOR YOUR ANSWERS AND YOUR CANDOR. AND CERTAINLY, THE GRASSY SPOT LOOKSES GREAT. I WAS CURIOUS THIS WAS ANOTHER THING THAT OCCURRED WHEN I WAS LOOKING AT THE PROJECT. DO WE HAVE OTHER MARIJUANA FACILITIES SO CLOSE TO RESIDENTIAL HOUSING? GREAT. THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW. MAYBE A BRIEF LIST IF ANYBODY COULD FOLLOW-UP WITH THAT, SO I COULD BE PREPPED FOR COUNCIL, BUT OTHER THAN THAT --
00:43:21.735: >> Chair Mills: YOU MISSED THE STRING. FOR A WHILE, WE HEARD A LOT OF PETITIONS. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS?
00:43:37.350: >> Planning Manager: COMMISSIONER, DISCH, THE PLANNING COMMISSION IS THE FINAL STOP FOR THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE AND THE SITE PLAN IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. HOWEVER, IF ANY SITE PLAN WAS PROPOSED FOR THAT LOT, THAT WOULD GO UNDER THE CURRENT REGS IT WOULD GO THROUGH THE PLANNING COMMISSION AND ON TO CITY COUNCIL.
00:43:58.471: >> Chair Mills: THANK YOU. COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT.
00:44:01.141: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: YES, QUICKLY. I THINK THE COMMISSIONER, MR. HART YOU SHOWED THAT -- SORRY IF YOU CAN HEAR SCREAMING CHILDREN. YOU SHOWED THIS, ON THE FIRST LINE, BUT CAN YOU JUST REMIND US WHAT IN THE ORIGINAL PROPOSAL, WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THAT BACK PORTION? IF ANYTHING?
00:44:24.164: >> THIS WAS PARKING LOT.
00:44:26.132: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: OKAY. THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT. THANKS.
00:44:29.769: >> Chair Mills: OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS? COMMISSICOMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDA.
00:44:36.109: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: I'M CURIOUS, MR. HART, DOES THE UNDERGROUND -- IS THERE INFILTRATION AT ALL? ARE THE SOILS BAD THERE? IT'S BAD. OKAY. IT SEEMS REALLY VARIABLE IN THAT AREA. IN TERMS OF AND AND CLAY. IS THAT MAINLY FOR THE FIRE TRUCK TO PULL UP THE BUILDING OR FUTURE USE OF ACCESS TO THE BACK?
00:45:09.542: >> THAT IS A SHARED ACCESS FOR BOTH ACCESS AND FRANCHISE ILITIES, TO SERVI THAT BACK LOT. THE EEMENT WILL BE IN PLACET THIS CURNT TIME, B -- SO IT IS AN ACCESS POINTO THA BACK LOT RIGHT NOW WHICH BELIEVE IS REQRED ASART OTHE LD DIVISION YOU KNOWT H TO HAVECCESS TO A PUBC STRT.
00:45:35.068: >> Commissner Gibb-Ranll: OKAY THANKS.Y.
00:45:38.905: >> Cha Mills: OTHECOMMENTS QUESTIONS? I HAVE A COUPLE. ONE FOLLOW-UP IS COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL. WHAT TYPE OF PHYSICAL OPERATION. WHAT ARE STOPPING PEOPLE FROM PARKING ON THE LAWN? HOW DO WE STOP THEM FROM DOING THAT?
00:46:11.871: >> THERE ARE NO PHYSICAL SEPARATIONS RIGHT NOW ON THE PLAN. -- WELL, I GUESS I CAN DOUBLE CHECK IF THERE IS GOING TO BE A CURB ON THE BACK OF THE SIDEWALK OR NOT. BUT -- I DON'T MEAN SIDEWALK, DRIVE. BUT PERHAPS CURBING CAN BE INSTALLED, EVEN SOME BOLLARD-TYPE THINGS COULD BE INSTALLED.
00:46:36.229: >> Chair Mills: IF THERE'S NOTHING RIGHT NOW, I'M NOT THE LANDSCAPE ARCHITECT O ON THIS, R PLANTING BUSHES OR SOMETHING THAT IS PHYSICALLY PLANTED TO STOP PEOPLE. LIKE, I WOULD ACTUALLY FEEL MORE CONFIDENT THEN THAT THIS IS FUNCTIONING AS TWO SEPARATE LOTS AND THAT, SURE, THERE COULD BE ANOTHER DEVELOPMENT THAT'S UNRELATED, BASED ON WHAT WE HEAR, IT HAS TO BE, YOU KNOW, DID IT COULDN'T BE SOME KIND OF MARIJUANA FACILITY, JUST BECAUSE OF THE PROXIMITY ISSUE AND TO AN EXISTING FACILITY. SO IF SOME DEVELOPMENT DOES GO THERE, THEY WOULD HAVE TO TEAR IT OUT. BUT I -- I DON'T WANT TO PLAY LANDSCAPE ARCHITECT AT THE TABLE. BUT I'M WONDERING IF THE LANDSCAPE BUFFER AROUND WORKS. THIS IS -- THIS IS LIKE A QUESTION THEN FOR THE DEVELOPMENT TEAM.
00:47:43.363: >> I'M HAPPY TO AGREE TO IT, BUT I DON'T OWN THE LOT.
00:47:57.410: >> I WILL TAKE THAT. I DON'T THINK WE HAVE ANY PROBLEMS WITH THE SHRUB. WE DON'T WANT TO PL PLANT A TRE. SOME LOW-GROWING SHRUBS, A PHYSICAL DELINEATION OR WE COULD DO A CURB ACROSS THERE.
00:48:22.435: >> Chair Mills: I WELCOME OTHER'S THOUGHTS BUT THAT WOULD GIVE ME MORE CONFIDENCE. A LOT OF THESE STANDARDS ARE RELIANT ON PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, -- NEIGHBORS CALLING IN AND I DON'T WANT TO -- LIKE, PARTICULARLY, IF THIS IS DONE INTENDED TO, YOU KNOW, HONOR THAT SEPARATION, I THINK PHYSICALLY PUTTING SOMETHING THERE TO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT, I DON'T KNOW THAT WE NEED BOLLARDS AND HONESTLY, I WOULD RATHER SEE SHRUBS RATHER THAN A CURB. MR. LENART?
00:48:57.837: >> Planning Manager:  MY CRACK STAFF HAS PUT TO GO A PROPOSED CONSIDERATION. IT WOULD BE A FIFTH CAN BE OF THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE PLAN THAT WOULD DIRECT THAT THE PETITIONER WORK WITH STAFF TO DEVELOP A LANDSCAPING PLAN, CURB OR OTHER METHOD TO CREATE A PHYSICAL BARRIER TO RESTRICT USE OF THE VACANT NORTHERN SITE.
00:49:18.424: >> Chair Mills: I LIKE THAT OR -- OR I ALMOST WOULD -- I KIND OF WOULD RATHER HAVE LANDSCAPING PLAN, RATHER THAN THE CURB. BUT I WILL GO WITH WHAT YOUR CRACK STAFF HAS DEVELOPED AND I WILL MOVE IT, I GUESS. DOES ANYBODY WANT TO SECOND IT? OKAY, COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN. SO NOW, WE ARE IN DISCUSSION. AMENDMENT, NOT THE OVERALL PLAN. BECAUSE IT WAS MOVED AND SECONDED AND NOW WE'RE IN DISCUSSION ABOUT THE AMENDMENT. SO WHAT DO PEOPLE THINK ABOUT REQUIRING THAT? COMMISSIONER CLARK?
00:49:54.794: >> Commissioner Clarke: I THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA TO SEPARATE THOSE TWO PARCELS TO KEEP THE SEPARATION. I WAS KIND OF CONCERNED ABOUT THE SECURITY AND I THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD IF THERE'S SOME KIND OF BUFFER THERE, ESPECIALLY HEDGE THAT THE SECURITY ON PROPERTY STAYS ON PROPERTY AND DOESN'T HAVE SECURITY GUARDS OR ANYTHING AT THE BACK OF IT, THINGS LIKE THAT. SO THERE'S A LOT OF BENEFIT THERE.
00:50:26.592: >> Chair Mills: SO COMMISSIONER CLARKE. IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU LIKE HEDGE, SHUT WE CUT OFF THE CURB.
00:50:35.801: >> Commissioner Clarke: I LIKE THE HEDGE TOO.
00:50:39.739: >> Chair Mills: SO SEEPING IT AS PART OF IT, I'M -- SO KEEPING IT AS PART OF IT, I'M OKAY WITH THAT AS WELL. OTHER DISCUSSION? COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT.
00:50:49.582: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: I WOULD FINE WITH PUTTING LANDSCAPE. IF YOU PUT CONCRETE TO RIP THE CONCRETE OUT, THAT SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF WORK AND EXPENSE. I WOULD BE IN FAVOR OF JUST SAYING A LANDSCAPE, BUT, I WOULD ALSO GO EITHER WAY. THAT'S JUST MY GENERAL FEELING G ABOUT THE SITUATION.
00:51:13.606: >> Chair Mills: AND LEAVE IT UP TO STAFF TO HASH OUT THE DETAILS. COMMISSIONER LENART.
00:51:17.944: >> Planning Manager:  THIS LANGUAGE WOULD PROVIDE FOR THAT OPTION, BUT IF FOR SOME REASON WE DIDN'T THINK THE LANDSCAPE WAS GOING TO ADEQUATELY -- THIS PROVIDES SOME FLEXIBILITY, BUT GENERALLY, I THINK THAT THE DEVELOPMENT TEAM IS PROBABLY OF THE SAME MIND AS REFERENCED BY THE TREE COMMENT THAT THERE'S PROBABLY TO INTENTION TO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT THAN LESS FOR FUTURE CONSIDERATION.
00:51:51.577: >> Chair Mills: OTHER COMMENTS ON THE AMENDMENT? DO YOU WANT A ROLL ALL ON THE AMENDMENT OR CAN WE DO A VOICE VOTE.
00:51:58.384: >> Planning Manager:  A VOICE VOTE ON THE AMENDMENT IS OKAY.
00:52:01.554: >> Chair Mills: OKAY. ALL IN FAVOR OF THE AMENDMENT TO REQUIRE LANDSCAPING, CURB OR OTHER THING, PLEASE SAY YES OR RAISE A HAND. ANY OPPOSED? I SEE NONE. OKAY. NOW WE HAVE AN AMENDED MAIN MOTION. I STILL HAVE TWO MORE COMMENTS -- OR QUESTIONS. ONE IS ABOUT THE E.V. PARKING. AND THERE WAS A COMMENT THAT THE PETITIONER MADE THAT IT'S NOT REQUIRED, AND THAT WAS CONFUSING TO ME, BECAUSE I DO SEE, LIKE, RETAILER AND PROVISIONER, CAN YOU HELP US UNDERSTAND THAT.
00:52:43.396: >> Planning Manager:  YES, THE E.V. APPLIES TO SITE PLANS FOR CITY COUNCIL. THIS IS NOT A SITE PLAN FOR CITY COUNCIL.
00:52:51.537: >> Chair Mills: GOT IT.
00:52:52.071: >> Planning Manager:  IF THE REAR PARCEL WAS DEVELOPED THAT WOULD BE ADDING NEW FLOOR AREA AND THAT WOULD REQUIRE COMPLIANCE WITH THE E.V. ORDINANCE.
00:53:04.583: >> Chair Mills: SO SITE PLANS FOR THIS USE TYPICALLY DO STOP WITH US? UNLESS IT'S A BRAND NEW DEVELOPMENT PROBABLY.
00:53:12.692: >> Planning Manager:  IF A NEW BUILDING WAS BEING PROPOSED THAT WOULD REQUIRE CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL BUT BECAUSE NONE. TRIGGERS THAT WOULD NECESSITY THAT ARE BEING PROVIDED HERE, IT'S -- IT IS YOUR AUTHORITY AND E.V. PARKING IS NOT REQUIRED.
00:53:32.878: >> Chair Mills: GOT IT. IF THIS WERE SOMETHING THAT WOULD GO BEFORE CITY COUNCIL, THEY WOULD NEED TO PROVIDE -- 10% OF THE PARKING WOULD NEED TO BE INSTALLED. ANOTHER 10% WOULD NEED TO BE E.V. READY WHICH IS CONDUIT THERE AND 15% WOULD NEED TO BE CAPABLE. THAT MEANS THEY HAVE A BIG ENOUGH BOX. SO THEY WOULD HAVE TO INSTALL ONE CHARGER?
00:53:52.365: >> Planning Manager:  YES.
00:53:54.533: >> Chair Mills: IF THAT ARE WERE REQUIRED, AND PROBABLY HAVE TWO SPACES WIRED TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT? AND THEN SPACE, AGAIN, THE -- THE ELECTRICAL CONNECTION FOR -- FOR ANOTHER CHARGER OR TWO. THE MATH ON THE SPOTS IS WEIRD.
00:54:12.351: >> I AGREE. THAT WAS MY READ AND MY FIRST REACTION WAS THEY'LL NEED TO PROVIDE THE E.V. PARKING BECAUSE THAT WENT INTO EFFECT ON FEBRUARY 14th, BUT AS MR. LENART MENTIONED, IT'S NOT A SITE PLAN FOR CITY COUNCIL. I TRIED TO ENCOURAGE THEM AND THEY WERE IN AGREEMENT, ALTHOUGH THE SHOPPING HABITS AT PROVISIONING CENTERS AND RETAILERS, THE CUSTOMERS -- IT'S A VERY QUICK TRIP. BUT EMPLOYEES, I SAID IF -- YOU MAY HAVE AN EMPLOYEE WHO WOULD LIKE TO CHARGE. AND SINCE THEY WERE REDOING THE PARKING LOT ANYWAY, THEY FELT IT WOULD BE EASY ENOUGH TO DO AND THAT WAS THE WHOLE PREMISE OF THE E.V. ORDINANCE, THAT IF YOU ARE DOING ENOUGH SITE PLAN IMPROVEMENTS PUT IN THE CAPABILITIES.
00:55:01.133: >> Chair Mills: VERY GOOD. CAN YOU REMIND US ONCE AGAIN. ONCE YOU SAID IT'S NOT REQUIRED I WAS LIKE WAIT, I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST REQUIRED. CAN YOU REMIND US, WHAT IS GOING IN?
00:55:16.549: >> OH, I WILL LET MR. HART EXPLAIN AGAIN. THEY WERE MAKING IT E.V. READY FOR -- THEY WERE PUTTING IN A -- I WILL STOP. ESSENTIALLY WE LOOKED AT THE SPATIAL REQUIREMENTS. WHEN YOU PUT IN AN E.V. PARKING SPACE, YOU NEED AN AISLE WIDTH TO ALLOW PEDESTRIANS TO GO BY. WHAT WE DID IS WE BUMPED THAT SIDEWALK OUT SO IT'S WIDER AT THE BUILDING. SO IN THE EVENT THAT IT EVER DOES GO IN, THERE IS A PHYSICAL SPOT THAT IT WILL FIT AND YOU WON'T HAVE TO MODIFY CURBS FOR GUTTERS. THE PROPOSED SPOT IS RIGHT NEXT NOT BUILDING. SO IT COULD BE A SLAB OF CONCRETE THAT YOU WOULD PULL OUT OR CUT OUT IN ORDER TO INSTALL THAT. SO VERY MINOR WORK TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT.
00:56:22.515: >> Chair Mills: OKAY AND YOU ARE WIRING IT NOW THEN?
00:56:25.351: >> NO, WE ARE NOT WIRING IT NOW. WE ARE JUST MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S PATIENT -- YOU KNOW, A SPOT FOR IT. AND IN THE EVENT IT DOES GO IN, WE WILL NOT HAVE TO RECONFIGURE THE PARKING LOT.
00:56:42.635: >> Chair Mills: OKAY. COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL.
00:56:43.669: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: I'M GLAD THE SPATIAL PART WORKS. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT JUST LEAVING IT WOULD BE REALLY CHEAP AND MEAN THAT IT'S SO MUCH EASIER FOR IT TO POTENTIALLY HAPPEN. AND, YOU KNOW, JUST GIVEN THAT, LIKE, G.M. JUST ANNOUNCED THAT THEY'RE GOING FULLY ELECTRIC BY 2035, THIS IS JUST -- THIS IS WHAT'S HAPPENING. IT JUST IS. AND AGAIN -- I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT YOU UPGRADE YR ENTIR ECTRICAL PANEL B TO PUT IN A HAPPEN FOR THE FUTURE IS A SMALL,MALL THINGHAT WOULD MAKE IT AN EAS LIFT F THE FUTU TO THREA IT ON THRGH DUST -- ANDGAIN,HE ME THAT A SLEE WOULD BE REAY MPLE AND STRGHTFORRD TO BE SET UP FOR THE FUTURE.A I WOULD -- I WOULD REQUEST THAT.
00:57:51.937: >> Chair Mills: IS A MOTION TO AMEND?
00:57:54.440: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: I -- WOULD WE BE AMENDING THE -- YEAH, WE WOULD BE AMENDING THE SITE PLAN, RIGHT?
00:58:03.616: >> Chair Mills: WELL, IT'S ADDING AN ADDITIONAL CONDITION, IS THAT FAIR, MR. LENART, LIKE, THAT'S WHAT --
00:58:09.855: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: YEAH. I WOULD FIRST LIKE TO KIND OF SEE WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK, I GUESS. IF THERE'S --
00:58:18.464: >> Chair Mills: I WOULD SECOND THAT MOTION SO THAT WE CAN DISCUSS IT.
00:58:25.437: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: LET'S DISCUSS IT.
00:58:28.307: >> Chair Mills: PUTTING IN THE CONDUIT TO MAKE IT READY? ANY DISCUSSION? I SEE SOME THUMBS UP. MR. LENART WAS THAT -- OH, COMMISSIONER LEE.
00:58:39.151: >> Commissioner Lee: I WOULD BE IN FAVOR OF THAT AS WELL, THE CONDUIT, NOT THE ELECTRICAL ITSELF, BUT I WOULD BE SUPPORTIVE OF THAT.
00:59:01.006: >> Chair Mills: I KNOW IT WAS AN INFORMAL AMENDMENT. IT'S TO NOT MAKE IT E.V. INSTALLED BUT E.V. READY, THE INSTALLATION. CONDUIT.
00:59:09.548: >> Chair Mills: WHAT I'M HEARING IS A CONDITION THAT --
00:59:11.817: >> Planning Manager:  WHAT I'M HEARING IS A CONDITION THAT IT BE ESSENTIALLY TWO PARKING SPACES, BASED ON WHERE THEY PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED THE PROPOSED LOCATION WOULD BE, WOULD BE MADE E.V. CAPABLE. WHICH MEANS OBVIOUSLY DESIGNED FOR THE PHYSICAL, THAT INCLUDES THE RACEWAY AND THE SPACE. IT WOULD REQUIRE SPACE ON THE PANEL. I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO MAKE THAT CONSISTENT WITH OUR ORDINANCE, IF WE ARE GOING TO BE MEASURING THAT BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO YET BE WIRED. THE -- THE CONDUCTORS DON'T NEED TO BE INSTALLED.
00:59:52.491: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: THAT SOUNDS GOOD. I LIKE THAT.
00:59:55.594: >> Chair Mills: SO E.V. CAPABLE, THAT'S THE -- THAT'S THE ENTRY LEVEL ON OUR GRID. THANK YOU FOR REMINDING US ABOUT WHAT THAT ALL ENTAILS. ANY OTHER DISCUSSION OF THE PROPOSED AMEND? ALL IN FAVOR, SAY, YES OR HANDS UP. I SEE EVERYONE'S HANDS. WE ARE BACK TO THE ORIGINAL MOTION THAT NOW HAS TWO AMENDMENTS ON IT. I HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION OR COMMENT, AND I HAVE TO GO BACK TO MY -- OH, THIS IS ACTUALLY -- THE PETITIONER MENTIONED THAT THEY ARE CHANGING OUT THE BUILDING LIGHTING TO BE DARK SKIES COMPLIANT WHICH IS FANTASTIC. THANK YOU. SO PRESUMABLY, EVEN IN THE SECURITY PLAN, WHICH WE UNDERSTAND WE MIGHT NOT BE PRIVY TO ALL OF THE SECURITY MEASURES BUT EVEN IN THAT FLOOD LIGHTS ARE NOT GENERALLY DARK SKIES COMPLIANT. SO THAT WE ARE NOT HAVING FLOOD LIGHTS ON THIS BUILDING EFFECTIVELY?
01:00:56.688: >> NO, THERE ARE NO FLOOD LIGHTS.
01:00:59.625: >> Chair Mills: FANTASTIC! GREAT. AND I WOULD JUST LIKE TO --
01:01:05.531: >> WE USE NIGHT VISION. NIGHT VISION CAMERAS TO GET ANYTHING THAT'S OUT A LITTLE BIT FARTHER BEYOND.
01:01:12.838: >> Chair Mills: OKAY. SO MORE LIGHT DOES NOT ALWAYS NECESSARILY MEAN MORE SECURITY. THAT'S THE MESSAGE I HEAR TOO. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS ON THIS PETITION? COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN?
01:01:34.626: >> Commissioner Milshteyn: I WANT TO CONFIRM, THE FENCING AROUND THE PROPERTY CURRENTLY IS GOING TO BE REMOVED; IS THAT CORRECT?
01:01:43.068: >> NO, WE WERE DEE KEEPING THE FENCING, AT LEAST AROUND THE NORTH AND WEST SIDE. EAST SIDE IS A MASONRY WALL, THAT IS ALSO PROPOSED TO STAY.
01:01:59.151: >> Commissioner Milshteyn: I GUESS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT IS THE LARGE GATE THAT'S CURRENTLY AT THE FRONT. THAT IS BEING REMOVED; IS THAT CORRECT?
01:02:06.925: >> THAT IS CORRECT. AT THE STREET SIDE.
01:02:09.394: >> Commissioner Milshteyn: OKAY. THANK YOU.
01:02:15.300: >> Chair Mills: MY OTHER COMMENTS? COMMISSIONER LEE.
01:02:17.603: >> Commissioner Lee: I DON'T REALLY TELL, IS THE FRONT CURB, THE CONCRETE CURB GOING TO BE A TURNING IN LANE? IS THAT SLATED TO BE REPLACED? THERE'S A LOT OF CRACKS, I SEE. SO I DON'T KNOW IF -- I REALLY JUST CAN'T TELL. AND THE REASON I'M BRINGING IT UP IS BECAUSE I SEE A PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL BUS STOP NEARBY AND I'M JUST THINKING FROM LIKE A STANDPOINT OF, LIKE, -- I THINK AESTHETICALLY AND WITH THE LANDSCAPING KIND OF BUFFER, I -- I OVERALL LIKE THE DESIGN. I THINK IT WILL BE BETTER THAN WHAT IS CURRENTLY THERE. I JUST ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE THAT'S USING THAT US ABOUT STOP IS GOING TO -- BUS STOP IS GOING TO FEEL COMFORTABLE AND SAFE. I WANT TO KNOW IF THERE'S ANY -- I COULDN'T TELL. IS THAT TURNING IN LANE JUST GOING TO REMAIN THE WAY IT IS? BECAUSE IT DOESN'T LOOK VERY GOOD.
01:03:15.127: >> NO, THE TURNING IN LANE DOES GET REMOVED AND REPLACED.
01:03:19.865: >> Commissioner Lee: AND NEW CONCRETE?
01:03:20.999: >> YES, AT OUR ENTRY ITSELF. AND THEN OUR SIDEWALK GETS REPLACED AT THE ENTRY.
01:03:35.480: >> Commissioner Lee: OKAY.
01:03:36.048: >> AFTER SITE PLAN, WE HAVE TO WORK IN WITH ENGINEERING. WE NEED TO TIE INTO A PLACE THAT'S A.D.A. COMPLIANT. SO IN THE EXISTING SIDEWALK THAT WE ARE TYING INTO IS NOT A.D.A. COMPLIANT, WE DO HAVE TO GO AT LEAST ANOTHER 15 FEET IN ORDER TO TRY TO FIND A PLACE THAT'S A.D.A. COMPLIANT TO TIE INTO.
01:04:07.212: >> Commissioner Lee: OKAY. GOT IT. I WANTED TO MENTION THE BUS STOP AND THE RESIDENTIAL USE IS OBVIOUSLY A SLIGHT CONCERN. I MEAN A GROCE GROSS OR SOMETHIA GROCERY OR SOMETHING THAT'S A LITTLE MORE IDEALLY ACDECIBEL, BUT WE DON'T -- ACCESSIBLE, BUT WE DON'T LIVE IN AN IDEAL WORLD. I WILL YIELD THE REST OF MY TIME. THANK YOU.
01:04:31.069: >> Chair Mills: ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ON THIS PETITION? ALL RIGHT. THEN WE'LL DO A ROLL CALL VOTE, RECALLING THAT THE INITIAL PETITION NOW HAS BEEN AMENDED TWICE.
01:04:44.416: >> Planning Manager: COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL?
01:04:47.252: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: YES.
01:04:48.220: >> Planning Manager: COMMISSIONER SAUVE.
01:04:52.391: >> Commissioner Sauve: YES.
01:04:52.991: >> Planning Manager: COMMISSIONER ABRONS.
01:04:57.095: >> Commissioner Abrons:  YES.
01:04:58.930: >> Planning Manager: COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT.
01:05:01.800: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: YES.
01:05:02.634: >> Planning Manager: COMMISSIONER DISCH?
01:05:05.404: >> Councilmember Disch: YES.
01:05:06.004: >> Planning Manager: COMMISSIONER LEE?
01:05:08.440: >> Commissioner Lee: YES.
01:05:09.007: >> Planning Manager: COMMISSIONER CLARKE?
01:05:11.643: >> Commissioner Clarke: YES.
01:05:12.244: >> Planning Manager: COMMISSIONER MILLS?
01:05:13.812: >> Chair Mills: YES.
01:05:14.279: >> Planning Manager: COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN?
01:05:17.949: >> Commissioner Milshteyn: YES.
01:05:18.617: >> Planning Manager:  THE MOTION CARRIES.
01:05:21.620: >> Chair Mills: VERY GOOD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, FOLKS. ALL RIGHT. THE NEXT ITEM, I'M SCROLLING THROUGH MY FOREVER LONG SCRIPT HERE FROM THE LAST PETITION. DECISION. DISCUSSION. THIS IS ITEM 9B, 2394 WINEWOOD AVENUE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE FOR PLANNING COMMISSION APPROVAL. AS BEFORE, WE'LL START WITH UP TO TEN MINUTES OF PETITIONER PRESENTATION AND THEN STAFF FILLING IN ANY -- PROVIDING A PRESENTATION BEFORE WE HAVE THE PUBLIC HEARING, AND THE MOTION.
01:06:10.402: >> Planning Manager:  JUST GIVE ME ONE MOMENT HERE.
01:06:13.638: >> Chair Mills: IN PROBLEM. -- NO PROBLEM.
01:06:39.164: >> Planning Manager:  DID I LOSE ANYONE?
01:06:44.503: >> Chair Mills: PETITIONERS DO YOU HAVE EVERYONE WHO YOU NEED? WHENEVER YOU ARE READY, YOU CAN PRESENT FOR UP TO TEN MINUTES.
01:06:54.880: >> I'M KATHY KEINAN, AND WE PREPARED THE SLIGHT PLAN. WE -- SL SITE PLAN. WE ORIGINALLY BROUGHT THIS PLAN. I WILL SHARE THE PLAN HERE. CAN EVERYONE SEE THAT OKAY?
01:07:15.100: >> Chair Mills: YES, WE CAN.
01:07:15.867: >> WE ORIGINALLY CAME WITH THIS SITE PLAN IN 2018. AND -- WELL, IF I CAN GET TO THE NEXT PAGE FOR YOU. AND THE -- AT THAT TIME, IT WAS FOR A MEDICAL MARIJUANA PROVISIONING CENTER. SITE WAS UPGRADED. THERE WERE A LOT OF IMPROVEMENTS MADE. THERE WAS IMPERVIOUS PARKING LOT REMOVED. THERE WAS NEW LANDSCAPING PUT IN. THERE WAS HANDICAPPED PARKING ADDED, A LIFT ON OUTSIDE OF THE BUILDING TO ACCOMMODATE THE HANDICAPPED PARKING. A DUMPSTER WAS ADDED. AND SINCE THAT TIME, ALL OF THOSE IMPROVEMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE. AND THEY HAVE BEEN FUNCTIONING AND THIS PETITION IS STRICTLY -- THERE'S NO CHANGES TO THE SITE PLAN. IT'S STRICTLY TO CHANGE FROM A MEDICAL MARIJUANA PROVISIONING CENTER, TO A MARIJUANA MICROBUSINESS. SO I'M GOING TO LET ERIC GO AHEAD AND TALK WITH YOU AND EXPLAIN TO YOU WHAT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE TWO THINGS ARE.
01:08:32.210: >> Chair Mills: I THINK YOU ARE STILL MUTED.
01:08:33.745: >> THERE. HOW IS THAT.
01:08:34.946: >> MY NAME IS ERIC. EYE HAVE BEEN OPERATING THE FACILITY SINCE 2017. ORIGINALLY, IT WAS AEDICAL MARIJUANA CAREGIVER OPERATION. SO IT WAS JUST SERVING MY PATIENTS. AND THEN FROM THERE, LIKE, KATHY SAID, IN 2018, WE WERE APPROVED AS A MEDICAL MARIJNA PROVISIONING CENTER. AND ALSO, THE SITE --O NOW WE HAVE A CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPCY FOR N ONLY THE PROVISIONING CENTER BUT ALSO THE MARIJUANA GROW A A PROCESSING FACILITY. SO THO -- THEROWND THE PROCESSI FACILITYECAUSE THE BUILDINGS M1, THOSE ARE AND THE PVISIONING CENTER WAS THEHANGES.N 2018, A WE MADES SO NOW -- SINCE THEN, THERE'S THE MARIJUANA MICROBUSINESS, A NEW LICENSE. IT'S AN ADULT USE LICENSE THAT IS A SINGLE LICENSE TYPE THAT'S ALL THREE OF THE USES THAT I WAS ALREADY DOING, COMBINED ON TO ONE LICENSE. SO INSTEAD OF HAVING THREE SEPARATE LICENSES FOR A PROVISIONING CENTER, A RETAILER, A PROCESS AND A GROW, IT'S A SINGLE LICENSE TYPE. IT'S CALLED A MICROBUSINESS, AND IT'S ESSENTIALLY A SCALED DOWN VERSION OF ALL THREE OF THOSE. SO IT'S 150 PLANTS AS OPPOSED TO THE 500 THAT I WAS PREVIOUSLY APPROVED FOR. AND THEN WE'LL AB LOUED TO PROCESS -- BE ALLOWED TO PROCESS ONLY OUR -- ONLY THE PRODUCT THAT IS PRODUCED IN-HOUSE, AND THEN WE'LL SELL IT TO THE PUBLIC, THE -- THE FLOWER, THE MARIJUANA FLOWER AND THEN ALSO THE CONCENTRATES THAT ARE PRODUCED. SO IT'S GOING TO BE A CLOSED LOOP. WE GROW EVERYTHING ORGANIC. SO IT'S A SMALL VERTICALLY INTEGRATED MARIJUANA FACILITY. AND SO THAT REQUIRES A SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE. SO THAT'S WHAT WE ARE DOING TODAY. SO I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT -- ABOUT THE PREVIOUS APPROVAL OR THIS -- OR THIS MICROBUSINESS AS WELL.
01:11:08.333: >> Chair Mills: GREAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MR. KHAN OR MR. LENART HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD?
01:11:16.508: >> I DON'T HAVE MUCH TO ADD. THIS IS JEFF KHAN. SOME OF YOU MAY RECALL THIS PETITIONING COMING BEFORE YOU IN 2018. THE PETITIONER DID IMPLEMENT ALL OF THE IMPROVEMENTS THAT THEY PROMISED THEY -- THEY WOULD IMPLEMENT. SO WE WERE VERY PLEASED BY THAT. WE WERE HAPPY TO ISSUE A CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY FOR THE PROVISIONING CENTER. AND I THINK THE ONLY THING I WOULD LIKE TO DO IS READ THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION. STAFF RECOMMENDS THAT THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE BE APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS, WHICH ARE SUMMARIZED IN THE MOTION, SUBJECT TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION CONSIDERATION, BECAUSE THE PROPOSED SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE IS OF SUCH LOCATION SIZE AND CHARACTER AS TO BE COMPATIBLE WITH THE ZONING DISTRICT IN WHICH THE SITE IS SITUATED, AND THE LOCATION AND SIZE OF THE PROPOSED USE, ITS NATURE AND INTENSITY, THE SITE LAYOUT AND ACCESS, AND THE FACT THAT THE PROPOSED USE ON PUBLIC SERVICES WOULD NOT BE HAZARDOUS OR INCONVENIENT TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD OR UNDULY CONFLICT WITH TRAFFIC IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. THAT'S THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION. I WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT WE HAVE NOT HEARD OF ANY NEIGHBORHOOD COMPLAINTS SO FAR.
01:12:31.449: >> Chair Mills: VERY GOOD. ALL RIGHT. I WILL OPEN THE PUBLIC HEARING. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PERSONS TO SPEAK UP TO THREE MINUTES ABOUT THE PROPOSED 2394 WINEWOOD AVENUE SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE. YOU A MAUL 877-853-5247, AND THEN ENTERING MEETING I.D.936-53396143. THE CITY STAFF WILL SELECT CALLERS THAT DIGITAL RAISE THEIR HAND. DO YOU THAT BY PRESSING STAR NINE ON YOUR TELEPHONE. WHEN IT'S YOUR TURN TO SPEAK, YOU WILL HEAR AN AUTOMATED ANNOUNCEMENT AND MR. LENART WILL CALL ON YOU BY THE LAST THREE DIGITS OF YOUR TELEPHONE NUMBER. IF YOU COULD MOVE TO A QUIET AREA AND MUTE ANY BACKGROUND SOUNDS SO WE CAN HEAR YOU CLEARLY AND PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS AT THE BEGINNING OF YOUR COMMENTS. IF THERE'S ANY CALLERS ON THE LINE THAT WISH TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING, AGAIN YOU PRESS STAR NINE TO RAISE YOUR HAND. ALL RIGHT. SEEING NONE, I WILL CLOSE THE PUBLIC LEARI HEARING AND COMMISR GIBB-RANDALL OR I WILL READ THE VERY LONG MOTION. WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO IT THIS TIME? THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
01:13:53.364: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: I WILL TAKE IT ON. OKAY.

01:16:28.286: >> Chair Mills: THANK YOU VERY MUCH, COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL. ANY DISCUSSION OF THE MOTION? COMMISSIONER DISCH.
01:16:48.406: >> Councilmember Disch: I WANTED TO ASK ABOUT THE ENERGY REQUIREMENT. THIS IS A PRETTY BIG BUILDING AND IT SEEMS LIKE YOU COULD OFFSET MORE THAN 10%, WHICH I KNOW IS NOT A REQUIREMENT, BUT I RECALL FROM AN EARLIER DISCUSSION OF A DIFFERENT GROW FACILITY, THAT THE ENERGY FOOTPRINT OF THESE FACILITIES IS CONSIDERABLE. AND SO WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE TO -- I'M ASKING THIS, I GUESS OF STAFF AS WELL AS THE PETITIONER, I DON'T KNOW IF IT UNREASONABLY RAISES THE COST, IF IT LOWERS YOUR ENERGY BILLS, I THINK THAT WOULD BE A GOOD THING. SO IS THE DESIGN CURRENTLY JUST TO MAX OUT THE WHOLE SURFACE ON THE ROOF? IS THERE ANY WAY TO GET MORE REDUCTION -- ADDITIONAL REDUCTION OTHER THAN 10%?
01:17:38.222: >> Planning Manager:  I WILL START FROM THE REGULATORY SIDE OF IT. IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY LOOKED AT CAREFULLY AND WE WANTED TO -- WE WANTED TO FIND A LEVEL THAT WAS ACHIEVABLE, IN THE -- AND RIGHTFULLY SO, THESE USES, PARTICULARLY GROW FACILITIES CAN HAVE A PRETTY HIGH ENERGY DEMAND, ALTHOUGH THEY ARE IMPROVING WITH MORE L.E.D. LIGHTING SYSTEMS AND THE LIKE. NONETHELESS, WE TRIED TO FIND A BALANCE THAT WOULD RECOGNIZE THAT THEY CAN BE PRETTY EYE ENERGY USERS AND THE -- HIGH ENERGY USERS AND THE REAL ESTATE FOR SOLAR PANELS MAY BE DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE HIGHER PERCENTAGES OF THAT ENERGY LOAD ON SITE. SO THAT'S THE STARTING POINT OF REGULATION. I GUESS I WOULD HAVE TO -- I WOULD HAVE TO DEFER TO THE PETITIONERS AND THEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCE THIS THEY FOUGHT IT WAS FEASIBLE TO ACHIEVE A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OR NOT.
01:18:40.051: >> SO I SPOKE WITH ONE ENERGY -- A SOLAR COMPANY, AND IT SOUNDS LIKE -- THEY SAID THE 10% WAS FEASIBLE. I THINK HE SAID IT WAS $115,000 INITIAL INVESTMENT, AND OBVIOUSLY, SOME OF THAT -- A LOT OF THAT COST IS RECUPERATED THROUGH ENERGY USE. I'M -- I DON'T OWN THE BUILDING. SO HAVING A SHORTER -- HAVING A LEASE ON MY BUILDING, THE WAY THE LEASE -- MY LEASE IS RIGHT NOW, I'M UNLIKELY TO SEE EVEN -- EVEN -- EVEN ONE TO ONE RETURN, UNLESS, YOU KNOW, I HAVE AN EXTENDED LEASE SITUATION, WHICH I DON'T HAVE RIGHT NOW, ALTHOUGH I HOPE TO. SO SO IT'S SOMEWHAT COST PROHIBITIVE TO ME, BECAUSE I'M UNLIKELY TO SEE THE -- TO SEE THE RETURNS. EVEN ON THE 10% THAT, YOU KNOW, WE TALKED ABOUT. SO -- SO ALTHOUGH -- ALTHOUGH 10% SEEMS LIKE A SMALL AMOUNT, IT'S A LOT OF -- IT'S A LOT OF SOLAR PANELS COVERING THE BUILDING. I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW MUCH IT IS, BUT IT'S SOMEWHERE AROUND 40% OF THE BUILDING, OR HALF OF THE BUILDING. IS WHAT 10% WOULD LOOK LIKE. SO THAT'S MY THOUGHTS ON IT.
01:20:22.586: >> Chair Mills: COMMISSIONER DISCH, YOU'RE ALL DONE? OKAY. COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL.
01:20:26.223: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: I'M CURIOUS ABOUT THIS AS WELL, AND I'M JUST WONDERING IF THE SOLAR COMPANY GAVE YOU KIND OF AN ESTIMATED RETURN ON INVESTMENT IN TERMS OF LIKE HOW MANY YEARS IT WOULD TAKE TO -- OF YOUR ENERGY BILLS TO BE ABLE TO MAKE IT WORTH IT T YOU JUST AS WE'RE DEVELOPIN ALL OF THESE THINGS AND COMING UP WITH THESE IT'S REALLY HELPFUL FOR US TO UNDERSTAND, YOU KNOW, JUST WHAT IT ACTUALLY MEANS FOR PEOPLE IN REALITY. AND SO AS WE HAVEAID, WE KNO THENERGY COSTS CAN BE SUPER HIGH AND I HOPE THAT -- THAT YOU HAVE TAY YOUR ERGY BILLS SO THAT AT LEAST - IF THIS COMES BA TO YOU TO CERTAINXTENT CAUSE WE -- WEAW SOME PRETTY SORING STATIICSBOUT HOW MUCHNERGY USE THESE FACILITS ARE FOR GROWING BUT I'M CURIOUS  I KWHENE P SOLARN O O HOU,HE GAVE U LIKE A NUMBER OF YEARS SEDN OUR U OF HOW QUILY WE WOU ROUP THAT COST. AND I'M WONDERING IF THEY GAVE YOU A SIMILAR PREDICTION BECAUSE IT'S HELPFUL FOR US TO KNOW AS A COMMISSION.
01:21:29.720: >> UM, YEAH, I THINK -- I THINK HE SAID IT WAS SOMEWHERE AROUND FIVE OR SIX YEARS IS WHERE -- IS WHERE THE BREAK EVEN POINT IS. SO THAT'S WHAT THEY TOLD ME. I HAVEN'T -- YOU KNOW, I HAVEN'T LOOKED TOO FAR INTO IT, BUT THAT'S WHAT I WAS TOLD.
01:21:54.979: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: THAT'S HELPFUL FOR US TO HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT THAT MEANS FOR PEOPLE. THANKS FOR SHARING THAT.
01:22:01.485: >> SURE.
01:22:01.752: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: I HOPE YOUR LANDLORD UNDERSTANDS WHAT A GOOD DEAL HE'S GETTING! [ LAUGHTER ]
01:22:13.798: >> Chair Mills: ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS? COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT.
01:22:18.436: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: FOR STAFF, I'M CURIOUS, BECAUSE I REMEMBER WHEN WE HAD THESE, YOU KNOW, COME UP BEFORE, THERE'S A CERTAIN NUMBER OF PERMITS THAT THE CITY HAS. SO DOES TRANSITIONING THIS TO A MICROBUSINESS PERMIT MEANS IT'S FREEING UP MORE MER MITTS -- OR LIKE ANOTHER PROVISIONING PERMIT OR GROW PERMIT FOR OTHER BUSINESSES?
01:22:38.489: >> Planning Manager:  YES, IT WOULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF SORT OF OPENING UP ONE PERMIT. HAD.
01:22:44.061: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: OKAY. THANKS.
01:22:50.000: >> Chair Mills: THAT WAS THE SAME QUESTION THAT I HAD, COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT. SO I WILL ASK THE FOLLOW-UP ON THAT, WHICH IS THERE'S STILL A -- A DISTANCE SEPARATION. IS THAT TRUE? SO MICROBUSINESSES, THEY ARE STILL LIKE 600 BETWEEN THAT AND THE NEAREST EITHER OTHER MICROBUSINESS OR PROVISIONING CENTER/RETAILER? OKAY. GREAT. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS? I THINK WE'RE READY FOR A VOTE THEN.
01:23:27.338: >> Planning Manager:  I HAVE TO TURN MY MIC ON FOR IT. COMMISSIONER SAUVE.
01:23:34.078: >> Commissioner Sauve: YES. COMMISSIONER ABRONS.
01:23:35.112: >> Commissioner Abrons:  YES.
01:23:36.413: >> Planning Manager: COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT.
01:23:39.016: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: YES.
01:23:39.817: >> Planning Manager: COMMISSIONER DISCH.
01:23:41.952: >> Councilmember Disch: YES.
01:23:42.553: >> Planning Manager: COMMISSIONER LEE.
01:23:44.922: >> Commissioner Lee: YES.
01:23:45.489: >> Planning Manager: COMMISSIONER CLARKE.
01:23:49.293: >> Commissioner Clarke: YES.
01:23:49.894: >> Planning Manager: COMMISSIONER MILLS?
01:23:52.563: >> Chair Mills: YES.
01:23:53.030: >> Planning Manager: COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN?
01:23:55.966: >> Commissioner Milshteyn: YES.
01:23:56.634: >> Planning Manager: COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL?
01:23:57.735: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: YES.
01:23:59.670: >> Planning Manager:  THE MOTION CARRIES.
01:24:04.041: >> Chair Mills: VERY GOOD! YOU ARE ALL SET THEN.
01:24:07.444: >> THANK YOU.
01:24:08.412: >> Chair Mills: SUBJECT TO THE CONDITIONS.
01:24:09.513: >> THANK YOU.
01:24:11.015: >> Chair Mills: ALL RIGHT. OUR -- WE'RE ON ITEM 10, WHICH IS ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY FOR PUBLIC COMMENT. AND I'M GETTING A RESTART YOUR COMPUTER MESSAGE.

01:25:47.511: >> THERE WE GO. CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW?
01:25:50.014: >> Planning Manager:  YES.
01:25:51.582: >> OH, THANK YOU, EVERYONE. MY NAME IS MOHAMMAD SAIF HADIM. I LIVE IN THE FOREST HILLS COOPERATIVE. I'M A RESIDENT, A MEMBER AND ALSO ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. I'M SPEAKING AS A RESIDENT, NOT ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD BUT I WILL TAKE THIS BACK TO THE BOARD AT OUR NEXT MEETING. ACTUALLY, THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE ATTENDED A PLANNING COMMISSION AND ACTUALLY IT'S VERY INSTRUCTIVE. I LEARNED A LOT. AN I APPRECIATE THE THOUGHTFUL COMMENTS, BOTH FOR AND AGAINST THE PROJECT. YOUR CONCERNS FOR THE SECURITY. THAT'S ONE OF MY CONCERNS. I RECENTLY LEARNED THIS WEEK THAT THE PERMIT WAS ALREADY GRANTED. I DIDN'T KNOW THAT. I ATTENDED TWO COMMUNITY MEETINGS BEFORE WITH SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE ON THIS -- THAT WERE ON PRESENTING TONIGHT. SO I JUST WANTED TO STATE FOR PUBLIC RECORD, I'M IN OPPOSITION OF THIS AND THE REASON BEING, ONE IS SECURITY. BUT I'M A REGISTERED NURSE. I'M A PUBLIC HEALTH NURSE WITH CHILDREN SPECIAL HEALTHCARE SERVICES. I WORKED 14 YEARS IN NURSING DIRECTOR, AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE FACILITY OVERSEAS AND MENTAL HEALTH FACILITY. SO IT WAS INPATIENT. AND I HAVE BEEN AN M.P. IN EMERGENCY ROOMS. I'M FROM NEW YORK. SO I HAVE S SEEN WHAT MOOD-ALTERING SUBSTANCES DO. WE JUST SAW FOUR YEARS OF THAT, BUT I UNDERSTAND IF SOMETHING IS VOTED ON AND THIS PROJECT IS GOING FORWARD. I JUST WANTED TO STATE MY PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL OPPOSITION. THERE'S ME PLENTY OF MATERIAL. U OF M HAS AN EXCELLENT 80-PLUS PAGE REPORT THAT WAS PUT OUT LAST YEAR ON MARIJUANA, ITS IMPACT AND I WON'T GO THROUGH ALL OF THAT. EVERYONE CAN READ THAT. THIS IS MOVING FORWARD. BUT THIS IS -- THIS IS REALLY MY CONCERN AND SO WHAT WE HAVE AT HAND -- WHAT I HAVE IN MY HAND, WHAT I CAN DO IS JUST OBSERVE THIS PROPERTY. I MEAN I DO A LOT OF WALKING PAST THERE. THAT'S WHY SECURITY IS MIFF CONCERN. BECAUSE I LOOKED LAST WEEK AND I WENT TO THE OTHER 28 SITES ON GOOGLE MAPS. I WAS GOING TO DRIVE IT. THIS IS REALLY A UNIQUE LOCATION. AND BECAUSE OF THAT, THIS LARGE COMMUNITY BEHIND IT, AND THAT IS A CONCERN FOR MANY OF OUR MEMBERS AND I UNDERSTAND SOME PEOPLE SUPPORT THAT AND I GET THAT. BUT I WILL BE PERSONALLY OBSERVING AS A BOARD, IF SOMETHING -- A PROBLEM COMES UP, OF COURSE, WE DISCUSS THAT. SO WHAT WE HAVE IN OUR HAND TO DO, IS REPORT, MAKE COMPLAINTS TO THE STATE IF THERE ARE REPORTABLE, IF WE --
01:28:33.677: >> Planning Manager:  30 MORE SECONDS, SIR.
01:28:35.312: >> AND WE WILL DO THAT BECAUSE THAT COULD IMPACT THE FUTURE LICENSES FOR THIS PROPERTY. SO THEY SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS WHAT WE WILL DO. THEY WILL DO WHAT WE'LL DO AND WE'LL DO WHAT WE ARE ABLE TO DO. SO THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY.
01:28:46.657: >> Chair Mills: THANK YOU HAVE. I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER CALLERS ON THE LINE THAT HAVE CALLED IN. SO WE'LL CLOSE THIS OPPORTUNITY FOR PUBLIC COMMENT AND MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER 11, WHICH IS COMMISSION PROPOSED BUSINESS. IS THERE ANY? I WANT TO NOTE SOMETHING THAT CAME UP TO PUT IN THE NOTES. FOR THE FUTURE. WHICH IS WE HAVE THAT YOU CANNED -- BECAUSE WE HAVE SENT -- AT COUNCIL'S REQUEST, THEY ASKED WHAT OPPORTUNITIES THERE ARE FOR SITE PLANS FOR SMALL IMPACT PROJECTS OFF THEIR PLATES AND MOVE THEM DOWN THE FOOD CHAIN. IF YOU CALL, WE SENT BACK A MEMO HIGHLIGHTING WHAT OPPORTUNITIES THERE MIGHT BE FOR EITHER PROJECTS TO, YOU KNOW, HAVE US AS THE LAST LINE OF DEFENSE OR, YOU KNOW, JUST BETTER SCALE THOSE PROJECTS. TONIGHT'S DISCUSSION ABOUT THE E.V. CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE, MADE ME RECOGNIZE THAT THERE MIGHT THEN BE A GAP. AND MAYBE THAT'S OKAY BECAUSE TAKING THAT AWAY MEANS THAT, YOU KNOW, IT'S ONE LESS THING. AT THE SAME TIME, IF WE ARE EASING SOME OF THE PROCESS, I WOULD JUST HIGHLIGHT THAT THAT'S A BIT CONCERNING TO ME THAT I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE A DISCUSSION AT LEAST, ABOUT WHETHER THAT'S THE RIGHT THRESHOLD,  ACTUALLY FOR THE E.. ORDINANCE TO KICK IN IF THIS IS -- AGAIN, THE IDEA IS FUTUREPROOFING OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AT ALL SCALES. SO IT LOOKS LIKE I'M NOT THE ONLY PERSON WHO HAD THAT IDEA. COMMISSIONER DISCH?
01:30:29.159: >> Councilmember Disch: I'M REALLY GLAD YOU BROUGHT THAT UP, BECAUSE WHEN COUNCIL VOTED ON THE E.V. ORDINANCE, I DID POSE A QUESTION TO STAFF, COULD THIS LITTLE SENTENCE, WHICH I THEN FORGOT ABOUT BECAUSE I HAD THE SAME REACTION EVERYBODY ELSE DID TO IT'S NOT REQUIRED. BUT STILL, I HAD -- I DID POSE A QUESTION TO STAFF, WOULD WE MODIFY THAT, THAT WE WOULD NOT BRING BY RIGHT SITE PLANS TO COUNCIL. THAT WOULD EXCLUDE AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF PROPOSALS FROM -- OF NEW PROPOSALS. YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE TWO-THIRDS, I THINK ARE BY RIGHT, THAT -- OR NO. NEVER MIND, I WON'T SAY THAT BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW MANY. BUT STILL, IT WOULD BE A LOT AND I THINK THAT WE -- I DON'T THINK THAT WE WANT -- THAT'S NOT THE RIGHT THRESHOLD
