00:06:21.251: >> HELLO, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
00:06:22.986: >> Mayor Taylor: YES, WE CAN.
00:06:23.754: >> HI, MY NAME IS NICHOLAS GLYNOS AND I'M A Ph.D. CANDIDATE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF MOLECULAR AND PHYSIOLOGY. AND I'M CALLING IN SUPPORT OF THE RESOLUTION TO DECRIMINALIZE ENTHEOGENIC PLANTS IN ANN ARBOR. I WAS CLOSING TRACKING THIS RESOLUTION TO WHERE IT IS TODAY. AND I HAVE TO SAY THAT SEEING THIS RESOLUTION BOUGHT FORTH IN MY HOME CITY OF ANN ARBOR IS EXTREMELY EXCITING. IT MAKES ME FEEL PROUD WHERE THIS CAN BE OPENLY DISCUSSED. THIS IS EXCITIN IT BRINGS IO A QUESTION A BLANKET LODGE DRUG LONG DRUGPOLICY AND PLANTS AND S HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY SAFE AND TOLERABLE RELATIVE TO OTHER LEGAL DRUGS LIKE ALCOHOL AND TOBACCO. IN THESE TIMES OF UNPRECEDENTED CHANGE AND UNCERTAINTY, I BELIEVE IT'S TIME THAT WE ASK IF THESE DATED POLICIES ARE RELEVANT AND APPLICABLE IN TOATODAY'S SOCIETY. I BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT TO THE CITIZENS IN THE FUTURE OF ANN ARBOR AND THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. ON THE SURFACE LEVEL, THIS WILL HAVE VERY LITTLE EFFECT ON THE DAY-TO-DAY LIVES OF THE ANN ARBOR CITIZEN. IT PTHESE PLANTS POSE VERY LITTE REAT TO THE SAFETY OR THE WELL-BEING OF ANN ARBOR CITIZENS AND MAKE UP A MERELY A FRACTION OF THE CITY'S TOTAL CRIME AND DO NOT NECESSITY CURRENT OR ADDITIONAL LEVELS OF MANPOWER TO ENFORCE THEM. IT WOULD MARK A SIGNIFICANT FORWARD-THINKING STEP TOWARDS THE IMPROVEMENT OF HEALTH, WELL-BEING AND OTHERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. MANYF THESE ENTHEOGENIC PLANTS HAVE HELPED TREAT MANY FORMS OF MENTAL ILLNESS AS YOU PROBABLY READ ABOUT. TO CONTINUE TO DENY THE EFFICACY AND IMPROVE THE HUMAN CONDITION IS TO PERPETUATED AND OUTDATED DRUG SYSTEM. WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE ON THE FOREFRONT OF CHANGE AND TO BE A LEADER IN THIS COUNTRY AS MORE AND MORE MUNICIPALITIES WORK TOW TOWARDS INITIATING SIMR DECONTRODECRIMINALIZATION. HOW MUCH MORE TIME DO I HAVE REMAINING?
00:08:45.395: >> Clerk Beaudry: ABOUT 30 SECONDS.
00:08:46.430: >> SO IN 1970 WHEN THE NIXON ADMINISTRATION PASD THE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE ACT NEARLY ALL WERE DEEMED TO HAVE ZERO MEDICINAL VALUE. THIS SWIPE OF PEN BUT A HALT TO A BURGEONING FIELD OF STUDY AND FOR THE FOLLOWING 30 YEARS ESSENTIALLY NO RESEARCH WAS CARRIED OUT ON THESE SUBSTANCES. FINALLYHERE HAS BEEN A SEARCH, PSYCHEDELIC RESEARCH CENTERS AND FDA APPROVED TRIALS ARE APEERING ACROSS THE GLOBE, REVEALING EXCITING NEW ADVANCEMENTS. THANKS TO YOU ALL, ANN ARBOR AND OUR OWN UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN NOW HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO JOIN THE LIKE OF OTHER CITIES AND RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS LEADING THIS MOVEMENT. TODAY WITH THE PASSING OF THIS RESOLUTION, WE AS A CITY COULD MAKE THE STENT TT WE AR COMMITTED TO EYEFOLD-THINKINGTHG A -- A FORWARD-THINKING APPROACH, TO ANN ARBOR CITIZENS AND THOSE WHO WILL FOLLOW OUR LEAD. PLEASE CONSIDER THE MANY LIVES THAT HAVE ALREADY BENEFITED FROM THESE PLANTS AND VOTE YES ON THIS THIS RESOLUTION. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION THIS EVENING.
00:09:49.926: >> Clerk Beaudry: TIME.
00:09:50.460: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS JUL BARRON.
00:10:09.813: >> Clerk Beaudry: MS. BARRON, WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING IN 292.
00:10:16.153: >> HI. MY NAME IS JULIA BARRON. I'M A THERAPIST HERE IN ANN ARBOR. AND I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF DECRIMINALIZE NATURE ANN ARBOR, AND I VERY STRONGLY SUPPORT OUR RESOLUTION. AS A THERAPIST, I SEE PEOPLE EVERY DAY AT THE END OF THEIR ROPE, TRYING TO GET MEN FOR THINGS LIKE TREATMENT RESISTANT DEPRESSION, ADDICTION, ANXIETY, PTSD AND END OF LIFE ANXIETY. THE RATES OF THESE ARE ONLY ON THE RISE DUE TO THE COVID PANDEMIC. THERE'S SO MUCH SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE, CURRENT CLINICAL TRIA GOING ON IN OTHER PLACES IN THE COUNTRY AND OTHER PLACES IN THE WORLD BEIN, AND THERE'S T OF WORK BEING DONE IN OTHER CITIES WHO CRIMINALIZED THESE ENTHEOGENIC AND FUNGI, BUT THEY ARE NOT CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TO THE PEOPLE OF ANN ARBOR. THIS RESOLUTION IS ABOUT RESTORING OUR CONNECTION TO OURSELVES AND RESTORI CONNECTION TO NATURE. OUR ANCESTORS USED THESE PLANTS AND FUNGI, AND THERE'S EARLY DOCUMENTATION OF THIS. WESTERN SOCIETY, SADLY, HAS ALMOST ELIMINATED THE USE OF THESE NATURAL COMPOUNDS. IN THE THE CITIES THAT DECRIMINALIZED, OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA; SANTA CRUZ, CALIFORNIA; DENVER, COLORADO, THERE'S ZERO REPORTS OF ISSUES DUE TO MISUSE OF THESE SUBSTANCES, DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE, AND GENERAL PROBLEMS SINCE THEY HAVE BEEN DECRIMINALIZED. WE ASK THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR, WE ASK THE CITY COUNCIL TO HELP US ELIMINATE THE FEAR OF ARREST AND PROSECUTION BY PEOPLE USING THESE SUBSTANCES. WE WOULD LIKE OUR COMMUNITY TO CONTINUE TO BUILD A CONTAINER FOR THEIR USE, OFFERING HARM REDUCTION PRACTICES AND EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES. I CONCEDE THE REST OF MY TIME. THANK YOU.
00:12:30.654: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT QUESTIONER IS TARYN SCHIFF.
00:12:45.769: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER ENDING IN PHONE NUMBER 2, TARYN SCHIFF, YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND SPEAK. YOU NEED TO UNMUTE YOUR PHONE. UNMUTE YOUR PHONE.OU COULD I BELIEVEOU PRESS STAR SIX. THERE YOU GO. YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND SPEAK.
00:13:15.565: >> MY NAME IS TAR INN SCHIFF, I'M A RESIDENT OF ANN ARBOR AND I WORK HERE AS A MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL. LIKE JULIA, I WORK WITH PEOPLE SUFFERING FROM DEPRESSION AND PTSD. AND I'M FRONTED WITH PEOPLE RECEIVING THE SAME TREATMENT AND NOT FINDING A WAY OUT OF THEIR SYMPTOMS IN. MY PURSU OF BETR WAYS TO HELP PATIENTS, I KEPT UP WITH THE GROWING BODY OF EVIDENCE SHOWING THAT CERTAIN ENTHEOGENIC PLANTS PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH BENEFITS AND ARE GOOD IN TREATING SOME OF THE PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS. I RESPECT THE CULTURAL PRACTICES OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLE THAT LAID THE GROUND WORK FOR THIS DATE, GO BACK BEFORE RECORDED HISTORY. ANTHROPOLOGISTS SHOW THAT ENTHEOGES, HAVE BEEN USED FOR YEARS. THEY ARE FOR LESS LIKELY TO PRODUCE HARMFUL SIDE EFFECTS EFS COMPARED TO THE PHARMACEUTICALS THAT OUR PATIENTS ARE TAKING. WITH A BACKGROUND IN SOCIAL WORK, I WOULD LIKE PEOPLE TO IMPROVE THEIR QUATY OF LIFE SEVERAL OF MY PATIENTS ARE AWEAR OF SHOWING ENTHEOGENICS MEDICAL PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS. I EXPLAINED TO THE THIRD PATIENT WHO EXPLAINED WHEN ONE DRUG MAY BE AVAILABLE TO HER. FOR FIRST TIME, I FELT AIL SENSE OF HOPE IN KNOWING THIS RESOLUTION WOULDE GNG TO COUNCIL IN A FEW DAYS. I REALIZE WE ARE APPROACHING A TIPPING POINT. INITION TO THE BROADENING AWARENESS THAT THESE PLANTS HAVE BEEN AND MOUNTING SUPPORT OF THEIR SAFETY AND EFFICACY AND THREE OTHER CITIES HAVE DECRIMINALIZED ENTHEOGENIC PLANTS IN OAKLAND, THERE'S NO NEGATIVE SEQUENCES AND NOW ANN ARR HAS THE CHANCE NO JOIN OTHER PROGRESSIVE CITIES AND PUSH THE MOVEMENT FORWARD. THE TIDE IS TURNING. ON THE PROFESSIONAL AND LEVEL, THE DECRIMINALIZATION OF THESE PLANTS IS NOT GOING TO CHANGE MY WORK OR LIFE IN ANN ARBOR, BUT ON A LARGER LEVEL, DECRIMINALIZATION IS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN ADDRESSING THE SOCIAL, POLITICAL, AND LETHAL CHALLENGES LIMITING THE HEALING POTENTIAL AND FURTHER PLEX MORATION OFNTOGENICLANTS. AS AN ADDED BONUS, DECRIMINALIZATION ALSO REPRESENTS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION FOR ALLOWING LAW ENFORCEMENT TO RECONSIDER AND REPRIORITIZE EFFORTS IN WAYS THAT MORE EFFECTIVELY SERVE OUR CITY. DECRIMINALIZING ENTHEOGENIC WILL HELP TO PAVE THE WAY WITH OTHER RPROGRESSIVE CITIES IN THE COUNTRY. THANK YOU.
00:15:46.649: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS JESS WILLIAMS.
00:16:02.966: >> Clerk Beaudry: JESS WILLIAMS? MAYOR, IT APPEARS THAT HE HUNG UP.
00:16:14.844: >> Mayor Taylor: OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS DIANA QUINN.
00:16:35.098: >> Clerk Beaudry: MS. QUINN.
00:16:35.765: >> YES.
00:16:36.032: >> Clerk Beaudry: GO AHEAD.
00:16:36.633: >> CAN YOU HEAR ME? MY NAME -- MY NAME IS DR. DIANA QUINN. I AM A UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN ALUM, AND A LONG-TIME RESIDENT OF WARD 4 IN ANN ARBOR. I'M A NATUROPATHIC PHYSICIAN AND HAVE BEEN PRACTICING FOR 15 YEARS TO SUPPORT PATIENTS IN BODY, MIND AND SPIRIT. IN THAT TIME, I SPECIALIZED IN INTEGRATIVE MENTAL HEALTH, WORKING TO HELP MANY PATIENTS WITH DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY TO FIND RELIEF. OFTEN PEOPLE COME TO ME TO SEEK HOLISTIC AND INTEGRATIVE OPTIONS WHEN CONVEIONAL MEDIC TREATMENTS ARE INSUFFICIENT TO PROVIDE THE RESULTS THAT PEOPLE NEED, OR WHEN THEY CREATE UNWANTED ADVERSE EFFECTS. SOME OF THE MOST PROMISING NOVEL MENTAL HEALTH THERAPIES THAT MEDICINE HAS TO OFFER ARE IN THE AREA OF PSYCHEDELIC OR ENTHEOGENIC PLANT MEDICINE. RESEARCH IN THE FIELD OF PSYCHEDELIC SCIENCE AND THE THERAPEUTIC USE OF THESE MEDICINES HAS DONSTRATED SAF AND TREMENDOUS BENEFIT IN HELPING PEOPLE RECOVER FROM TREATMENT RESISTANT DEPRESSION, POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER, ADDICTION, ANXIETY AND SUPPORTING PEOPLE FACING TERMINAL DIAGNOSES AT END OF LIFE. ADDITIONALLY, AS A CHICANO, I HAVE BEEN TRAINING WITH ELDERS AND MAESTROS TO WORK WITH ENTHEOGENIC IN TRADITIONAL CEREMONIES. THESE TEACHINGS AND CEREMONIES HAVE BEEN WIDELY USED BY INDIGENOUS PEOPLE IN THE AMERICAS NOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS. -- FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS. WESTERN BIOMEDICAL SCIENCE IS JUST NOW BEGINNING TO CATCH ONE INDIGENOUS WISDOM REFERRED TO IN TRADITIONAL ECOLOGICALAS KNOWLEDGE. WE ARE JUST BEGINNING TO LEARN THROUGH A WESTERN SCIENTIFIC LENS ABOUT THE ADVANCED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY THAT INDIGENOUS CULTURES HAVE LONG KNOWN ABOUT MEDICINE, HEALING, ECOLOGY AND OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE NATURAL WORLD. THOUSANDS OF YEARS OF EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE THAT HAS BEEN GATHERED BY THE FIRST PEOPLE THAT ARE STILL IN PLACE AROUND THE GLOBE, SHOW US HOW THE SACRED MEDICINES CAN BE USED TO HEAL AND RESTORE BALANCE. THE IMPORTANCE OF PROTECTING AND PRESERVING CANNOT BE OVERSTATED. THE BENEFIT OF ENTHEOGENICS FROM CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL TRAUMA FROM BLACK, INDIGENOUS AND PEOPLE OF COLOR, SEE THE BENEFIT OF HEALING THE WOUNDS OF RACIALIZED TRAUMA.
00:19:12.221: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECOND HAS.
00:19:13.690: >> DECRIMINALIZING SACRED PLANT MEDICINE IS THE VERY FORM THAT BLACK AND BROWN CULTURE HAVE BEEN LOST AND TRIPPED OF FOR HEALING OSELF THRGH HUNDREDS OF YEARS OF COLONIZATION AND IT'S MY SINCERE HOPE THAT THE ANN ARBOR CITY COUNCIL IMPROVE ACCESS TO THESE MEDICINES BY VOTING YES TO PASS THIS RESOLUTION. THANK YOU.
00:19:33.476: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER, LARRY NORRIS.
00:19:44.153: >> HELLO. CAN EVERYONE HEAR ME?
00:19:46.122: >> Mayor Taylor: YES, WE CAN.
00:19:47.123: >> GREAT. HELLO. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK THIS EVENING. I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO COUNCICOUNCILMEMBER HAYNER AND BANNISTER TO INTRODUCE THIS RESOLUTION AND I WANT TO THANK THE ANN ARBOR CITY COUNCIL FOR CONSIDERING THIS. MY NAME IS DR. LARRY NORRIS. I GREW UP IN THE METRO DETROIT AREAND UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN ANN ARBOR ALUM GRADUATING WITH A DEGREE IN COGNITIVE BIOSCIENCE. I CURRENTLY LIVE IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA AND I RECEIVE MYTORATE. I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF A NONPROFIT CALLED ENTHEOGENIC RESEARCH INTEGRATION EDUCATION WHICH PROVIDE EDUCATION A INTEGRATION SERVICES TO THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA, AND I'M A COFOUNDER OF THE DECRIMINALIZE NATURE CAMPAIGN WHICH BEGAN IN OAKLAND IN JUNE OF 2019 AND IT PASSED UNANIMOUSLY AND I HAVE BASKETBALBEEN OFFERING SUPPORT E INCREDIBLE DECRIMINALIZE NATURE ANN ARBOR TEAM. I WOULD LIKE TO BUST SOME MYTHS. DENVER DECRIMINALIZED MUSHROOMS ONE YEAR AND FOUR MONTHS AGO. AND OAKLAND DECRIMINALLED ENTHEOGENICS ONE YEAR AND FOUR MONTHS AND AGO SANTA CRUZ 8 MONTHS AGO. TO DATE THERE'S BEEN ZERO REPORTS OF DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE, BEING ON SCHOOL NEWS.RTY OR ANY OTHER FEAR-BASED INSTEAD OF FOCUSING ON FEAR-BASED MYTHOLOGIES WE COULD BASE OUR INQUIRY FROM LOVE AND COMPASSION. HOW MUCH COULD IT HEAL OUR COMMUNITIES? HOW MUCH COULD IT HELP THE MENTAL HEALTH OF ANN ARBOR CITIZENS? THIS IS WHAT THE SCIENCE, MILLENNIA OF INDIGENOUS TRADITION, AND ACROSS THE US A TELLG US. SO WE CAN SEE DECRIMINALIZATION AS A RISK REDUCTION STRATEGY, THOSE ALREADY HAVING EXPERIENCES CAN FEEL SAFE TO FIND THE SUPPORT THAT WE NEED. THOSE NEW TO ENTHEOGENE CAN EDUCATE THEMSELVES. PEOPLE WILL NATURALLY WANT TO SEE WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT. RATHER THA PERPETUATE A SYSTEM CAUSING FEAR A AND ANXIETY, ANN ARBOR IS NOW A LEADER IN THIS MOVEMENT BUT YOU ARE NOT ALONE. A STRONG NETWORK OF SUPPORTIVE COMMUNITIES IN DENVER, OAKLAND AND STA CRU HAVE DECRIMINALIZED, AND OTHERS ARE NOT FAR BEHIND.
00:22:22.078: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
00:22:23.246: >> EVEN MARQUETTE IS BEGINNING TO ORGANIZE. ANN ARBOR IS A CHARACTER LIKE NO OTHER IN THE US AND DESERVES TO BE OPEN THE RIGHT SIDE OF HISTORY TO BE ONE OF THE FIRST FOUR CITIES TO LEGIZED MUSHROOMS. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU TO THE DECRIMINALIZE NATURE TEAM, NASH ANNARBOR CITY COUNCIL FOR THIS ISSUE. GO BLUE.
00:22:48.738: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS MICHELLE HUGHES.
00:23:03.553: >> Clerk Beaudry: MICHELLE HUGHES, CALLER 677.
00:23:05.988: >> HI, THIS IS MICHELLE HUGHES I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE HEALTHY STREETS AND I THINK THAT THOSE -- THIS HEALTHY STREETS PROGRAM WAS A VISIONARY RESPONSE TO UNPRECEDENTED SITUATION TO COVID-19 AND THE THIS WAS IN RESPONSE TO THAT UNPRECEDENTED SITUATION. I THINK WE NEED TO SEE IT THROUGH. WE NEED TO -- THIS IS AN EXPERIMENT. WE NEED TO SEE WHAT IS GOING ON AND GIVE PEOPLE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ADAPT TO THE CHANGES. WE NEED DRIVERS TO GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADAPT THE DRIVING HABITS AND GET USED TO THESE THINGS, JUST LIKE EVERY TIME THERE'S CONSTRUCTION ON THE ROAD, AND WE NEED CYCLISTS AND PEDESTRIANS TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DISCOVER THAT THIS NEW INFRASTRUCTURE EXISTS. AND WORK ITNTO THEIR PLANS. SOME OF THESE THINGS HAVE ONLY BEEN IN PLACE FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS AND THAT'S JUST NOT ENOUGH TIME SO REALLY SEE THE RESULTS AND TO PULL THE PLUG EARLY AND NOT GET THE INFORMATION THAT WE ARE TRYING TO GET BY THIS EXPERIMENT, WOULD BE A WASTE OF THE EXPERIMENT. IT WOULD BE A WASTE OF THE ENTIRE EXPERIMENT. THIS IS A TIME WHEN WE NEED TO DO THINGS WE HAVE NEVER DONE BEFORE. AND IMPROVING SAFETY FOR BICYCLISTS AND PEDESTRIAN IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO PRIORITIZE, AND SO WE NEED TO PRIORITIZE THAT LIKE NEVER BEFORE. WE NEED TO GIVE PEOPLE DISTANCE. WE NEED TO GIVE PEOPLE SPACE TO DO SOCIAL DISTANCING, SO THEY CAN PASS EACH OTHER SAFELY. WE NEED TO GIVE PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADAPT THEIR WILL BE GOOD FOR COVID-19 AND WILL BE GOOD IN THE LONG TERM FOR OUR CARBON NEUTRALITY GOALS. TO PLEASE GIVE US AN OPPORTUNITY TO LET THIS -- TO LET THESE SAFE STREETS -- TO LET THESE HEALTHY STREETS PLEA OUT AND WE'LL LEARN WHAT WE NEED TO LEARN. WE'LL ADAPT WHERE WE NEED TO ADAP AND DON'T --
00:25:34.970: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
00:25:36.138: >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
00:25:37.573: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER, BROGAN BROVAN. -- MEGAN BROVAN.
00:25:46.882: >> HI, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
00:25:48.718: >> Mayor Taylor: YES, WE CAN.
00:25:50.586: >> GREAT. HI, EVERYONE. MY NAME IS MEGAN AND I LIVE IN WA O. I JUST WANTED TO COSIGN BASICALLY EVERYTHING MICHELLE JUST SAID AND REGISTER MY SUPPORT FOR THE HEALTHY STREETS. LONG STORIES SHORT, Y YOU APPROD THE EXPANSION. YOU HAD THE BENIT OF INPUT OF STAFF AND THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION, SO YOU SHOULD ALL KNOW BY NOW HOW AND WHY THESE EXPANSIONS HELP TO KEEP OUR NEIGHBORS SAFE. YOU SHOULD ALL KNOW BY NOW THAT SLOWER DRIVING SPEEDS ARE SAFER FOR EVERYONE, INCLUDING DRIVERS. I REALIZE THAT SOME DRIVERS ARE UPSET ABOUT THESE EXPANSIONS BUT THE AVERAGE DRIVER DOES NOT HAVE THE BENEFIT OF THE EDUCATION THIS BODY HAS HAD. WE DON'T YET EVEN HAVE NO ADD IT TOONFIRM WHETHER DRIVERS ARE ACTUALLY BEING SLOWED DOWN TO DEFER TO DRIVERS AND END THESE PILOTS, WOULD SHOW YOU ALL OF UO WALK AND BIKE. I'M MOST FAMILIAR WITH THE PROJECTED BIKE LANES IN BROAD BROADWAY. I SEE SOME ING STU. PEOPLE I SEE RIDIN IN WORK CLOTHES. I SEE EXPERIENCED CYCLISTS. I SEE KIDS ENJOY A MODE OF TRANSPORTATION THAT ALLOWS THEM SOME SHRED OF INDEPENDENCE. I WOULD IMAGINE THAT'S IMPORTANT WHEN ANN ARBOR KIDS ARE HOME FOR VIRTUAL SCHOOLING. I THINK IT'S GOOD AND INNOVATIVE AS MICHELLE. ON NORTH DIVISION, I SEE DRIVERS GOING THE SPEED LIMIT FOR ONC BEFORE THE BIKE LANE INSTALL I WAS HARASSED BY DRIVERS ALL THE TIME ON DIVISION AND BROADWAY, WHETHER I WAS ON THE STREET OR THE SIDEWALK. THIS IS A FORM OF HARASSMENT TO LET THESE PROTECTIVE LANES STAND. IN MY EXPERIENCE, DRIVERS HAVE SHOWN THAT THEY ARE UNWILLING OR UNABLE TO DO SIMPLE THINGS LIKE SLOW DOWN TO PASS SAFELY. IT'S NOT THE CYCLIST FAULT OR PEDESTRIANS FAULT THAT DRIVERS ARE CARELESS. THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR AREAS LEEK DOWNTOWN, AND INFRASTRUCTURE LEEK THIS IS EXTREMELY NEEDED. I REALIZE SOME OF YOU PROBABLY GOT SOME EMAILS AND I KNOW IT SUCKS TO GET ANGRY EMAILS BUNT I MAILS BUT IURGE YOU TOTA FIRM. WHILE DRIVERS MAY BE COMPLAINING TO YOU ABOUT THE EXTRA TIME IT TOOK TO GET ACROSS TOWN, IT'S KEEPING PEOPLE LIKE ME SAFE. TO SAY SORRY CARS WANT TO GO FAST SO YOU CANNOT GO SAFELY, IS NOT WHERE WE SHOULD BE IN 2020, WHEN WE ARE WORKING TOWARDS A2ZERO. I WOULD ASK THAT YOU LEAVE THIS RUN FOR THE TIME PREVIOUSLY APPROVED AND SINCE I HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME, I'M ONE OF THOSE WINTER CYCLISTS THAT PEOPLE LIKE TO SAY WE DON'T EXIST. WE DO EXIST. I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE. THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR TIME.
00:28:45.094: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. I BELIEVE WE MISSED MR. REAM, MR. DEAN, AND JESS WILLIAMS. MR. REAM, ARE YOU AVAILABLE?
00:29:00.409: >> Clerk Beaudry: MR. REAM, CAN YOU UNMUTE YOUR PHONE? MR. REAM, IF YOUNME YOU PHONE, YOU CAN SPEAK.
00:29:16.859: >> AM. I UNMUTED?
00:29:18.928: >> Mayor Taylor: YOU ARE UNMUTED.
00:29:20.095: >> YOU CAN SEE MY LEVEL OF TECHNOLOGICAL CONFIDENCE. WE OFFERED WORDING THAT WOULD PROTECT THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR MORE FROM ANY POSSIBLE PROBLEMS AND I DON'T SEE IT IN THE RESOLUTION. WE'RE HAPPY TO PUT IT IN. OR IF THE LEGAL DEPARTMENT WISHES, WE CAN DROP THE WHOLE PART ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO DO. OUR DECRIMINALIZED NATURE, IT'S TAKING CULTURAL LEADERSHIP, WHEN FACTS POINT TO A NEED TO MOVE IN ANOTHER DIRECTION. ANN ARBOR LEADS TO LEAD THIS NATIONN PROBLEM SOLVING BECAUSE PEOPLE HERE ARE SO SMART. WE LOOK AT THE DATA AND WE CAN ALSO SEE THAT A TRADITIONAL PLANT SHOULD NOT BE LABELED A SCHEDULE ONE DRUG. YOU NEED NEW TOOLS IN OUR SOCIETY FOR SO MANY THINGS. WHO CAN PRETEND THAT WE FOUND GREAT OR EVEN ADEQUATE SOLUTIONS FOR MAJOR PROBLEMS LIKE ADDICTION, DEPRESSION, AIETY, SUICIDE, ET CETERA. WE DESPERATELY NEED TOOLS THAT WILL HELP TO DEAL WITH ALL OF THIS, AND IT WILL HELP HUMAN BEINGS HAVE A DEEPLY HELD CONNECTION WITH NATURE. WE NEED TOOLS TO HELP FIND SPIRITUALITY AND MEANING IN LIFE ALSO. NATURE OR GOD OR THE FORCE OR WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT HAVE GIVEN US THESE TOO, AND SHALL WE SCORN THE HOLY BIOLOGICAL GIFTS AND PUNISH PEOPLE. ARE WE SMARTER THAN GOD? WE ALL KNOW THAT THE REASON THESE MAGICAL PLANTS ARE ILLEGAL IS BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ANY REAL SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE. THESE PLANTS WERE MADE ILLEGAL BY THE CHURCH BECAUSE THEY WANTED A MONOPOLY ON SPIRITUALITY AND WOULD NOT DREAM WITH PUTTING ONE COMPETITION FROM NATURE. LOVERS PLANT P POTIONS WERE BURD AT THE STAKE. THESE PLANTS WERE PUT ON EARTH FOR A REASON AND IT'S A GROSS ABSURDITY THAT WE ARE HAVING A DISCUSSION ABOUT NATURAL PLANTS BEING ILLEGAL IN THE LAND OF THE FREE AND THE HOME OF THE BRAVE WHERE ALL PEOPLE HAVE THE GOD GIVEN RIGHT TO LIFE, LIBERTY AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS. AND THESE THINGS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AREAFE PHYSALLY. THEY MAY BE TERRIFYING SOMETIMES OR LIFE-CHANGING, BUT YOU WILL STILL BE ON THE COUCH AND YOU WILL STILL BE FINE. BUT CORONAVIRUS CANNOT STOP HISTORY FROM MOVING FORWARD. WE NEED TO MAKE CLEAR PROGRESS WITH THERAPEUTIC BREAKTHROUGHS BEFORE WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE WRECKAGE OF COVID-19. OUR RESOLUTION WILL NOT DO MUCH MORE THAT BROADEN THE DISCUSSION ABOUT EFFECTIVE NEW THERAPEUTIC MODALITIES IN THE USA AND MAYBE PROTECT A FEW PEOPLE, BUT THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT.
00:31:54.483: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
00:31:55.617: >> LET'S MOVE FORWARD AND LET ANN ARBOR SHINE AND BE ANN ARBOR. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF SPEAKING TO YOU.
00:32:03.592: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER, JON DN, ARE YO AVAILABLE, MR. DEAN?
00:32:08.330: >> Clerk Beaudry: I BELIEVE MR. DEAN IS ON THE LINE. I MAY HAVE MISSED HIM EARLIER.
00:32:14.002: >> Mayor Taylor: VERY GOOD. CALLER 841.
00:32:19.041: >> HELLO, CAN YOU HEAR ME ALL RIGHT?
00:32:21.477: >> Mayor Taylor: YES, WE CAN. THANK YOU.
00:32:22.511: >> THANK YOU. HI, SO MY NAME IS JON DEAN, AND WILL B ATTENDING MY Ph.D. IN, I THE BIOMEDICAL SCIENCES FROM RIGHT HERE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN NEXT MONTH. AS A PART OF MY THESIS WORK, I HAVE BEEN RESEARCHING HOW PSYCHEDELIC COMPOUNDS ACT ON THE BRAIN AND I'M HERE TODAY TO TELL YOU WHY I BELIEVE YOU SHOULD CONSIDER VOTING YES ON THIS MOVEMENT. ALTHOUGH IT IS QUITE INTIMIDATING TO SPEAK TO A ROOM FULL OF POLITICIANS WITH A NAME LIKE JON DEAN, I'M GOING TO GIVE IT MY BEST SHOT ANYHOW. A LITTLE WATERGATE JOKE FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT GET IT. YOU CAN NEVER TELL ON ZOOM ON HOW THEY GO IT. ENTHEOGENIC WHICH ARE PLANTS CAN TREAT DEBILITATING AND TREATMENT RESISTANT TRAUMA-RELATED ITEMS SUCH AS DEPRESSION AND ADDICTION AND TREATING EMPATHYND COMPASSION. MANY HAVE STUDIES BEING CONDUCTED AT YALE, JOHNS HOPKINS AND THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AS ONE OF THE MOST EXPERIMENTS THEIR LIVE. I DO REALIZE THAT THESE PLANTS REALLY POSE SOME OF THE RISKS I BELIEVE THAT THE RESPONSIBLE RESPONSE USE,ESPECIALLY WHEN COE E OF A THERAPIST. MEDICATIONS HAVE THEIR OWN WELL-DOCUMENTED LONG-TERM PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL REST AND BECOME INEFFECTIVE WHEN TAKEN DAILY OVER THE COURSE OF SEVERAL MONTHS. ENTHEOGENIC HAVE A LOW ADDICTION PROFILE AND PEOPLE REPORT LASTs POSITIVE EFFECTS LLOWING A SINGLE DOSE. AND IT'S AN INALIENABLE RIGHT. IN FACT, MY OWN RESEARCH HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT ONE SUCH COMPOUND IS VERY CHEMICALLY SIMILAR TO A NEUROTRANSMITTER CALLED SEROTONIN AND THAT THE BRAIN MAKES BOTH OF TSE CHEMICALS. IT'S NOT A STRETCH TO SAY WHAT IS A A CRIMINALIZED SUBSTANCE IN OUR BODIES NATURALLY. WITH THE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH ON THE RISKS AND THE BENEFITS OF PSYCHEDELIC THERAPIES IS WARRANTED BUT OFTEN DIFFICULT TO PURSUE THROUGH GOVERNMENT FUNDING EVEN WHEN CONDUCTING ONES SELF WITH THE UTMOST IENTIFIC RIG. IT'S CHANGING THE CONVERSATION IN CLIMATE, INTO THE CLINIC FOR THOSE STRUGGLING WITH MENTAL HEALTH. THIS WILL ALSO HELP REFORM A DECADE LONG WAR ON DRUGS THAT IS --
00:34:50.892: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
00:34:53.262: >> THESE PROVIDE AN EMPATHY AND COMPASSION THAT IS CLEARLY NEEDED IN OUR COMMUNITIES NOW MORE THAN EVER. RESPSIBL USE WE CANHE FACILITATE AIL POSITIVE SOCIETAL CHANGE IF WE WORK TOGETHER TO PUT A MODEL IN PLACE THAT CONSIDERS ALL SCIENTIFIC, MEDICALLAL, SOCIETAL AND EDUCATIONAL RAMIFICATIONS. I REALLY APPRECIATE ALL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR CONSIDERATION ON THIS AND I WISH YOU ALL THE BEST AND STAY SAFE. THANK YOU.
00:35:20.856: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NT SPEAKER, JESS WILLIAMS. IS JESS WILLIAMS AVAILABLE?
00:35:30.999: >> Clerk Beaudry: YES, MAYOR. I BELIEVE HE HAS REJOINED THE CALL. MR. WILLIAMS? PHONE NUMBER 575? MR. WILLIAMS, YOU CAN GO AHEAD.
00:35:50.585: >> OKAY. THANKS. MY NAME IS JESS AND I'M HERE TO SUPPORT THE RESOLUTION TO DECRIMINALIZE NATURE IN ANN ARBOR. BECAUSE MA MAMMALS HAVE BEEN USG AND COMAS CONSUMING PLANTS AS FD MEDICINE AND WE ARE HERE TO RECONSIDER WHETHER THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD LABEL NATURE'S BOUNTY AS ILLEGAL AND WE BELIEVE IN FREEDOM AND THE RIGHT TO PURSUE HEALTH AND HAPPINESS. MOTHER NATURE GAVE US TOMATOES AND CORN AND SUNFLOWERS, PORTOBELLOS AND -- THIS RESOLUTION IS NOT JUST ABOUT OUR PERSONAL FREEDOM, BUT IT'S REALLY ABOUT SUPPORTING RESEARCH TOO. BECAUSE BEFORE TREATMENT CAN BE CREATED, WE HAVE TO B ABLE TO BE MEDICINAL AND THEY HAVE TO BE DECRIMINALIZED AND THAT CAN START WITH CITIES LIKE NOMAR GAANN ARBORTHAT WE WANT MORE IN. SO THERE ARE OVER 100 CITIES NATIONWIDE THAT HAVE THIS LEGISLATION IN PROGRESS RIGHT NOW. THIS MOVEMENT IS REALLY BIG. IT'S HAPPENING FAST AND IT'S NOT ING AWAY. ANN ARBOR IS REALLY THE KIND OF PLACE WHERE THESE IDEAS BEGIN AND WHERE THEY BLOSSOM AND WE ARE HOPING THAT WE CAN BE A LEADER IN THIS MOVEMENT TONIGHT. IF DO YOU GO AHEAD AND PASS OUR RESOLUTION, WHAT YOU WILL IS LIKELY INTERNATIONAL NEWS ATTENTION AND A BUNCH OF CITIES THAT FOLLOW IN OUR FOOTSTE. I KNOW IT MIGHT SEEM SCARY AND IT'S HARD TO GIVE UP CONTROL AND THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT WILL JUST EVOLVE IF WE ALLOW OUR CITIZENS TO HAVE THIS CHOICE. I WOULD LIKE TO REMIND EVERYONE THAT WE TRUST ANN ARBOR CITIZENS TO POSSESS AND USE FIREARMS THAT ARE CAPABLE OF TAKINGUM LIVES. AND I THINK THAT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO POSSESS AND USE PLANTS THAT ARE CAPABLE OF SAVING THEM. IF YOU CAN TRUST PEOPLE WITH THAT RESPONSIBILITY, WE CAN CERTAINLY TRUST THEM TO DECIDE WHAT KIND OF PLANTS WOULD BE ABLE TO GO INTO THEIR BODIES. SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME IN NSIDERING OUR RESOLUTION, AND WE HOPE THAT -- [ GARBLED AUDIO ] THANK YOU.
00:38:24.673: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. ARE THERE COMMUNICATIONS TODAY FROM COUNCIL? COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD? HA A COUE OFUICK UPDATESd:  I AND THEN ONE STATEMENT. THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK ABOUT THE MOBILITY COMMITTEE AND QUESTIONS ABOUT IT. IT REALLY BECAME AN EMOTIONAL ISSUE. I ALMOST FELT LIKE IT WAS SIMILAR TO SOME OF THE WORDING IN A2ZERO WHICH WE SUCCESSFULLY WORKED ON AACHIEVED A GOOD COMPROMISE AND IT WAS VOTED ON UNANIMOUSLY. REGARDING THE MOBILITY COMMITTEE, TOMORROW AT THE POLICY AGENDA COMMITTEE, I'M GOING TO RECOMMEND THAT NOT ONLY LEGISLATIVE ADVOCACY BUT ALSO ADVOCACY WITH STATE DEPARTMTS FALLNDER THEOLICY AGENDA COMMITTEE, AND SO THAT WOULD BE MOBILITY ISSUES AS WELL AS SUSTAINABILITY ISSUES, A A2ZERO AND THERE'S A LOT OF WORK BEING DONE IN THOSE AREAS AS WELL AS ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES. SECONDLY, I WANT TO ASSURE THE PUBLIC THAT WORK IS CONTINUING ON THE HURON CROSSWALK NEAR THAYER. THAT CROSSWALK WAS PUT IN ALMOST TEN YEARS AGO, AND IT HAS NOT MET MINIMUM STANDARDS, BUT THERE WILL BE A MEETING ON WEDNESDAY WITH THE DIRECTOR OF MDOT AND SO ALL OF THE KEY PLAYERS ARE FOCUSED ON IT, AND I'M VERY HOPEFUL THAT WE WILL HAVE A SOLUTION SOON. LASTLY, I BELIEVE THAT IF WE IN ANN ARBOR CANNOT WORK TOGETHER, THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO HOPE FOR A VICTORY IN NOVEMBER. AND OUR YOUNG PEOPLE, INCLUDING ELEMENTARY-AGED STUDENTS ARE VERY CONCERN. I T TWO GIRLS AT THE FARMER'S MARKET ON SATURDAY MORNING AND ONE OF THEM GAVE ME A PIN THAT STATES -- THAT SAID "VIRTUAL HUGS" AND IT SORT OF HAD A FLAG THEME TO IT. HER OLDER SISTER PRODUCED YARD SIGNS. THERE'S ONE BEHIND ME RIGHT NOW, PROBABLY CAN'T READ IT VERY LL. IT'S HUMANKIND, BE BOTH. AND SO I'M REALLY TOUCHED BY THE FACT THAT OUR ELEMENTARY-AGED CHILDREN ARE REMINDING US HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO BE KIND, TO BE HUMAN, AND TO WORK TOGETHER AND I HOPE THAT ANN ARBOR CITY COUNCIL CAN SET A GOOD EXALE. THANK YOU.
00:41:15.977: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
00:41:24.285: >> Councilmember Bannister:  I WANT TO THANK CHIEF COX AND SERGEANT CORY MILLS AGAIN BECAUSE WE HAD A ZOOM MEETING YESTERDAY FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF, ANDVER 55 COMMUNITY MEMBERS PARTICIPATED AND SO TODAY, WE'RE WORKING ON SEEING IF WE CAN GET THE VIDEO OF THAT ZOOM UPLOADED, BUT I WANT TO THANK CHIEF COX AGAIN FOR BEING GENEROUS WITH HIS TIME AND ANSWERING ALL OF OUR QUESTIONS AND CORY MILLS WAS EXCELLENT ALSO. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IF YOU CAN SCHEDU COMMUNITY MEETING WITH THOSE GUYS. IT'S HELPING WITH OUR COMMUNITY POLICING GOALS. AND THEN I ALSO JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT COUNCILMEMBER EATON AND I AND THE NATURAL FEATURES SUBCOMMITTEE MET TODAY. THEY ARE MEETING ONCE A WEEK AND THIS TIME WE MET TWICE A WEEK. WE ARE TRYING TO WRAP UP CHANGES TO THE UDC REGARDING OUR TREES AND IT'S A LONG PROCESS AND WE ARE GOING LINE BY LINE, AND IT WILL TAKE SEVERAL MORE MONTHS OF GOING THROUGH THE UDC AND THEN WE HAVE TO GO BACK THROUGH THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION AND THE PLANNING COMMISSION AND THEN TO COUNCIL. SO IT WILL BE A LONG PROCESS, BUT WEANT TO JUST REMIND PEOPLE THAT WE ARE -- A LOT OF US ARE WORKING ON CREATING A CULTURE OF APPRECIATION FOR OUR TREES AND OUR CHAMPION AND REGISTERED AND LANDMARK TREES. SO PLEASE STAY TUNED FOR MORE ON THAT AS WE CONTINUE TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS. THANK YOU.
00:43:07.856: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
00:43:09.257: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, MAYOR. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK STAFF, BRIAN STEGLITZ AND OTHERS WHO HOSTED A ZOOM MEETING WITH RESIDENTS IN THE FIFTH WARD WHO ARE AFFECTED WITH TESTING GROUNDWATER THAT IS COMING INTO THEIR BASEMENTS. THEY HAD A MEETING ON SEPTEMBER 10th THAT EXPLAINED THE PROGRAM AND HOW IT WILL WORK. I THINK MORE QUESTIONS WERE PROBABLY RSED IN THA DISCUSSION THAN WERE ANSWERED. IT WILL -- IT WILL TAKE A FLOODING EVENT OF SORTS TO TRIGGER THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT COME OUT AND SAMPLE THE WATER COMING INTO THE BASEMENT. SO IT'S NOT AS EASY AS YOU MIGHT CONSIDER. WE, AGAIN, WOULD HAVE TO WAIT FOR A RAIN EVENT TO OCCUR THAT WOULD HAVE WATER COME INTO THE PAVEMENTS WHERE THEY COME OUT AND TAKE SAMPLES AND TEST THEM. THE RESIDENTS WERE CONCERNED WITH THE OBVIOUS QUESTIONS OF WHAT IF A HOTAMPLE COMES BACK? WHAT'S THE -- WHAT'S THE REMEDIATION PLAN? WHO IS RESPONSIBLE? SO MANY QUESTIONS ROSE FROM THAT AND I GUESS WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO TALK ABOUT THAT AS WE TALK ABOUT GELMAN IN ANOTHER MONTH OR SO. MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE SOLID ANSWERS. I  KNOW THOSE ADULTS WILL WIND P IN THE COUNTY BUT RESIDENTS WOULD STILL LIKE TO KNOW IN TERMS OF CLEANUP OR REMEDIATION HOW THAT WOULD GO SO PERHAPS WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT LATER. I DO APPRECIATE THE FORMAT AND THE EXPLANATION AND THE TIMES WE HAVE TO PRESENT THAT. AND THEN I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK STAFF AND THE COMMITTEE. THE BIKE LANE ON MILLER BETWEEN BROOKS AND PAMONO OR BROOKS ON THE SOUTH AND THE NORTH SIDE OF MILLER HAVE BEEN REPAVED. I WAS DELIGHTED TODAY TO RIDE BY BIKE AND NOT HIT A RIM OR LOSE SOMETHING, OR VEER INTO TRAFFIC TO AVOID THE TERRIBLE CONDITIONS THAT EXISTED PRIOR. SO THAT IS WHERE I THINK WE SHOULD BE FOCUSING MORE OF OUR RESOURCES. I'M SURE WE WILL HAVE A DEBATE LATER IN DC-7, I BELIEVE. BUT I WOULD LIKE TO FOCUS OUR ATTENTION AND OUR RESOURCES TO THOSE KIND OF FIXES TO MAKE OUR STREETS SAFER ANYWAYS, THAT WAS DONE AND I DO APPRECIATE IT. AND LASTLY, TALKING WITH STAFF IN MEETING I HAD WITH COUNCILMEMBER LUMM ABOUT THE TRASH ISSUES IN DOWNTOWN, TRYING TO GET SEVEN DAY SERVICE OR SUNDAY SERVICE FOR THE BUSINESSES DOWNTOWN, IS A LOT MORE COMPLICATED THAN WE HAD HOPED BECAUSE OF CONTRACTS AND DIFFERENT ENTITIES DOING DIFFERENT THINGS AND TRUCKS AND SO IT'S NOT AS EASY AS IT COULD BE TO SOLVE THAT PROBLEM. ULTIMATELY, I THINK IT'S A WISE DECISION IF WE BROUGHT BACK THE SOLID WASTE PLAN AND DISCUSSED OUR SOLID WASTE. AND SO HOPEFULLY, WE'LL BRING THAT BACK IN OCTOBER FROM THIS COUNCIL TO DISCUSS AND SO WE CAN MOVE FORWARD WITH AN EFFECTIVE SOLID WASTE PLAN. THANK YOU.
00:47:26.247: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
00:47:27.448: >> Councilmember Nelson: THANK YOU. FOR -- THERE'S A MEETING THIS THURSDAY EVENING AT 5:30 P.M. FOR THE CHURCHILL DOWNS PARK STORMWATER BASIN PROJECT, AND IT'S GOING TO BE ON SITE. SO IT WILL BE AT THE CHURCHILL DOS PARK, THE ENTRANCE ON STEEPLECHASE DRIVE AT 5:30 P.M. THIS THURSDAY. IT'S GOING TO BE A WALK THROUGH. PROJECT SO THAT INTERESTED RESIDENTS CAN SEE IT. OBVIOUSLY IN A SOCIAL DISTANCED WAY. THOSE OF NEW THAT NEIGHBORHOOD THAT ARE INTERESTED IN THE FLOOD MITIGATION EFFORTS THAT'S THIS THURSDAY AT 5:30 P.M. THANKS.
00:48:08.523: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER SMITH.
00:48:10.558: >> Councilmember Smith: I WILL BE BRIEF. I WANT TO LET PEOPLE KNOW THAT AFTER LAST WEEK'S PRESENTATION FROM DR. STULTS ON THE A2ZERO PLAN, AND THE VERY SUCCESSFUL SOLARIZED PROGRAM, WHICH ALLOWED RESIDENTS TO BULK PURCHASE SOLAR INSTALLATIONS FOR THEIR HOUSE, THERE IS ANOTHEROLARIZEVE COMING UP SATURDAY AFTERNOON AT 2:00. IT'S AN ONLINE ZOOM MEETING. YOU CAN GO TO WWW.A2GOV.ORG/SOLAR TO FIND INFORMATION ON HOW TO CONTACT JULIE ROTH MILLS.

00:48:53.101: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. FURTHER COMMUNICATION FROM COUNCIL? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
00:48:57.805: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANKS. JUST REAL QUICK, I WANT TO GIVE A SHOUT OUT THAT THIS THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 24th, AT 6:30 P.M., IS THE JOINT PUBLIC SESSION TO Q&A AND TO HEAR YOUR CONCERN OVER THE GELMAN LITIGATION THAT'S COME TO AN END -- OR COMING TO AN END HERE, PART OF IT. IT'S AT 6:30 ON ZOOM AND IF YOU GOOGLE THE ANN ARBOR GELMAN MEETING, IT SHOWS RIGHT UP THERE. THERE'S NOT A GREAT LINK FOR IT. IT'S ON THE A2 GOV NEWS PAGE BUT IT'S A ZOOM MEETING THIS THURSDAY SEPTEMBER 24th AT 6:30 P.M. SO ALL OF THE PUBLIC -- THE INTERVIEWING PARTIES, THE STATE, REPRESENTATIVE DINGLE AND OTHERS HOPEFULLY WILL BE ON BOARD FOR THIS, AND WE'LL HAVE A LITTLE Q&A ABOUT IT, AND I LOVE WHAT I HAVE BEEN HEARING FROM RESIDENTS SO FAR AND KNOW THAT WE ARE FRTRYING TO GET THE BEST DEAL WE CAN OUT OF TS.
00:49:56.097: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER COMMUNICATION FROM COUNCIL. I WOULD LIKE TO FOLLOW UP ON COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER'S STATEMENT WITH RESPECT TO THIS WEEK'S MEETING AS MEMBERS OF COUNCIL, AND SOME MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC KNOW, WE WILL BE LOOKING TO HAVE OURSELVES PUBLIC HEARING SUFFICIENTLY IN ADVANCE SO WE CAN MAKE SOME SENSE OF ITND CORPORATE IT INTO, YOU KNOW, OUR THINKING. AND SO I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE THE FOLLOWING ANNOUNCEMENT WITH RESPECT TO OUR PUBLIC HEARING. NEGOTIATIONS AMONG GELMAN SCIENCES INC., EGL AND THE INTERVENER CITY OF ANN ARBOR AND SCIO TOWNSHIP AND THE HURON RIVER SHED COUNCIL HAVE RESULTED IN A PROPOSED FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED CONSENT JUDGMENT. PROPOSED OER AND PROPOSED SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS IN THE GELMAN LAWSUIT. THE MICHIGAN ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE GELMAN SCIENCES. IN OCTOBER, WE WILL DECIDE WHETHER TO APPROVE THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT DOCUMENTS. ANN ARBOR RESIDENTS AND OTHERS HAVE SHOWED INTEREST IN THE SETTLEMENT. WE HAVE SET UP AN EMAIL TO RECEIVE WRITTEN QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS. THERE WILL BE A JOINT QUESTION-AND-ANSWER SESSION ON THE 24th AS COUNCILMEMBER INDICATED, MEMBERS OF COUNCIL LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM RESIDENTS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS BEFORE COUNCIL VOTES AND WANT FOLKS TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO COUNCIL DIRECTLY WITH RESPECT TO THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT DOCUMENTS. I INTENT TO CALL A SPEAL SESSION OF ANN ARBOR FOR THE PURPOSE OF HEARING COMMENTS FROM THE PUBLIC REGARDING THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT DOCUMENTS IN THE GELMAN LAWSUIT. AT THIS POINT, I'M LOOKING AT SEPTEMBER 30, WEDNESDAY AT 6:00. AS WITH ALL CITY COUNCIL MEETINGS CURRENTLY, IT WILL BE HELD ELECTRONICALLY AND NOTICE VIA ZOOM AND NOTICE OF MEETING WILL BE ISSUED AND PUBLISHN ADVANCE OF. THAT TIME IS TENTATIVE. PLEASE STAY TUNED. WE NOW HAVE BEFORE US THE CONSENT AGENDA. MAY I HAVE A MOTION TO APPROVE THE CONSENT AGENDA. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER SMITH. SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM. DISCUSSION OF THE CONSENT AGENDA? COUNCILMEMBER SMITH?
00:52:08.663: >> Councilmember Smith: YES, I HAVE A QUICK QUESTION IF MR. FORNIER IS ON THE LINE, ABOUT CA-8, YOU DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO SUBMIT THIS AS A QUESTION. I APOLOGIZE. ME QUESTION IS IF WE ENTER INTO THIS LAND LEASE AGREEMENT, DOES THIS LOCK THIS INTO THE AIRPORT AS USE OF AN AIRPORT FOR THE NEXT 20 YEARS?
00:52:26.714: >> SO THIS IS A ZER DOLLAR LEASE AGREEMENT. I WANT TO POINT THAT OUT, AND THERE ARE A LOT OF COMPLICATIONS THAT WOULD INVOLVE ANY KIND OF PROTPROCESS TO GET US OUT OF THE PARENT. AIRPORT. I DON'T THINK THIS WOULD LOCK US IN. THERE ARE OTHER AGREEMENTS THAT ARE WAY MORE CONTROLLING OVER THE AIRPORT PROPERTY. WOULD BE A HEAVIER LIFT. IF WE COULD UNDO THOSE AGREEMENTS THIS ONE WON'T BE AN OBSTACLE EITHER.
00:52:56.911: >> Councilmember Smith: THAT ANSWERS MY QUESTION. I WON'T PULL IT. THANK YOU.
00:53:00.915: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER LUMM. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, YOU ARE ON MUTE.
00:53:09.990: >> Councilmember Lumm: I'M NOT GOING TO PROPOSE TO PLHESE TWO, BUT I JUST HAD SOME COMMENTS ON CA-12 AND CA-22. ON CA-12:00 THE PROJECT TO FILL THE SIDEWALK GAP ON FULLER COURT, I WOULD SAY THAT IT'S VERY DISAPPOINTING THAT THE U OF F HAS PULLED ITS FUNDING FROM THE PROJECT AND AS A RESULT THERE WILL NOT BE A CONNECTED DEWALK TO FULLER ROAD. I DO RECOGNIZE THAT THE UNIVERSITY, LIKE THE CITY AND OUR RESIDENTS IS FACING FINANCIAL CHALLENGES BUT TO PULL THE PLUG ON SOMETHING THE U OF M ALREADY AGREED TO, IS VERY FRUSTRATING. I ASKED IF THERE ARE OTHER INSTANCES OF JOINT UNIVERSITY CITY PROJECTS AND INITIATIVES WHERE THE U OF MAVE WITRAWN FUNDING AND THE RESPONSE WAS THAT, QUOTE, THE U OF M HAS BACKED AWAY FROM FUNDING EQUIPMENTS NOR MOST CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS, END QUOTE. AGAIN, THAT'S PRETTY DISAPPOINTING, AND I WOULD APPRECIATE IF STAFF COULD PROVIDE US THE DETAILS, PROJECTS AND AMOUNTS WHERE THE UNIVERSITY HAS PULLED THEIR FUNDING BACK. THE SECOND ITEM IS CA-22, THE RENEGOTIATED CONTRACT WITH ANN ARBOR'S POLICE OFFICERS. COUNCIL REJECTED THE INITIAL AGREEMENT IN JULY AND DIRECTED STAFF TO RENEGOTIATE CERTAIN ELEMENTS OF THE CONTRACT, INCLUDING RECOMMENDATIONS MADE BY ICPOC. THE RECOMMENDED AGREEMENT HAS MADE MEANINGFUL PROGRESS ON SEVERAL NONECONOMIC ITEMS, BUT NOT ALL, AND THE ECONOMICERMS OF THE CONACT ARE UNCHANGED. I REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT IMPROVING PAY INCREASES THREE YEARS OUT AND AGREE WITH THE STATEMENT WITH THE COVER MEMO THAT THEY ARE A NOTABLE CONCESSION, GIVEN THE CURRENT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. I ASKED IF OTHER MAJOR UNION AGREEMENTS INCLUDE SIMILAR PAY INCRSES OVER THE 2020 TO 2023 PERIOD AND THE ANSWER WAS YES. BOTH ASCME AND THE FIREFIGHTERS SO THIS IS NOT PRECEDENT SETTING IN THAT RESPECT. ALTHOUGH I DO HAVE RESERVATIONS, I WILL SUPPORT THE RENEGOTIATED AGREEMENT. IN AN AGREEMENT WHERE THE UNION HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT CONCESSIONS ON DISPLE AND TRAINING, AND IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE THE POLICE HAVE PERFORMED EXCEPTIONALLY WELL IN SERVICE TO THE PUBLIC DURING THE PANDEMIC AND ROBUST PERIOD OF PUBLIC PROTEST, WE MUST RECOMMEND RETAINING THE ORIGINAL COLA AGREEMENT AND PROVIDING THE PAY INCREASES IN RECOGNITION OF OUR POLICE OFFICERS' EFFORTS. THANK YOU FOR LISTENING.
00:55:43.744: >> Morayr: COUNCILMEMB HAYN.
00:55:47.414: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANKS. I WOULD REQUEST THAT WE PULL CA-19 FOR DISCUSSION. THANK YOU.
00:55:56.123: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
00:55:59.727: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. NO NEED TO PULL IT. I WANT TO SAY A PUBLIC THANK YOU FOR CA-16, THE TRAFFIC CALMING PROJECT ON FERNWOOD AVENUE WHICH IS PRETTY SIGNIFICANT AND NOT ONLY IMPORTANT FOR THE IMMEDIATE NEIGHBORS BUT THAT IS A ROAD THAT ENDS UP VERY CLOSE TO SCARLET AND MITCHELL SCHOOLS. SO I THINK IT'S AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT PIECE OF OUR -- NOT ONLY OUR TRAFFIC CALMING INFRASTRUCTURE OUT OUR SAFETY AROUND SCHOOLS. THANKS.
00:56:28.656: >> Mayor Taylor: FTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR OF THE CONSENT AGENDA WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CA-19, PLEASE SAY AYE. [CHORUS OF AYES] ALL OPPOSED? CONSENT AGENDA WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CA-19 IS APPROVED WITH 11 COUNCILMEMBERS PRESENT, ALL VOTING IN THE AFFIRMATIVE, THUS SATISFYING THE EIGHT VOTE REQUIREMENT WITH RESPECT TO CA-8.
00:56:55.783: >> Clerk Beaudry: CA-2.
00:57:00.487: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU, CA-2:0 2, MY APOLOGIES. CA-19, RESOLUTION TO APPROVE CHANGE ORDER NUMBER ONE WH CADILLAC ASPHALT LLC FOR THE 2020 STREET RESURFACING PROJECT, IN THE AMOUNT OF $8,899,300, IN THE AMOUNT OF $230,418.69, AND TO APPROPRIATE $73,000 FROM THE ALTERNATIVE TRANSPORTATION FUND IN THE AMOUNT OF 52,435 FROM THE LOCAL STRT FUND AND $60,000 FROM THE DOWNTOWN DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER SMITH. DISCUSSION, PLEASE OF CA-19. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
00:57:46.867: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANKS, MR. MAYOR. I TRIED TO UNTANGLE THIS LAST NIGHT. I DIDN'T COME WITH A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OFHAT THE EIGHT VOTE BUDGET OVERRIDE IS FOR, WHEN I LOOK AT THE MEMO AND THE ATTACHED TABLE, IT APPEARS TO HAVE HEALTHY CHUNKS OF FUNDING REQUESTS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE HEALTHY TREATS NEIGHBORHOOD, OR HEALTHY STREETS DOWNTOWN OR OUTSIDE OF DOWNTOWNAJOR STREETS. AND SO I WAS CONFUSED AS TO WHERE THIS FUNDING NEED AROSE FROM. MY UNDERSTANDING WAS WHEN THESE WERE PASSED, THESE THREE OR TWO SEPARATE HEALTHY STREETS PROGRAMS THAT THERE WAS SORT OF A DEFINED AMOUNT OF WHAT IT WOULD COST US AND THAT WAS IT. AND THIS APPEARS TO SAY NO, NOW WE HAVE A BUDGET AMEMENT HERE AND S I WONDER IF -- I DON'T KNOW WHO COULD ANSWER THIS QUESTION FOR ME. I'M SORRY IT WASN'T PART OF MY WRITTEN QUESTIONS AND I READ THE RESPONSES BUT I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND IT. WHAT IS THIS CHANGE ORDER NECESSARY FOR AND WHY ARE THEY ASSOCIATED WITH THE HEALTHY STREETS PROGRAM? ANYONE WANT TO STEP UP TO ARE THAT ONE?
00:59:04.445: >> I CAN TAKE FIRST ATTEMPT AT IT MR. MAYOR, COUNCILMEMBERS, CAN YOU ALL HEAR ME OKAY? OKAY. VERY GOOD. SO I THINK THERE ARE A COUPLE OF THINGS AT PLAY HERE. THE FIRST IS CADILLAC ASPHALT WAS COMPETITIVE PROCURED TO DO THE ANNUAL RESURFACING PROGRAM FOR TH CIT AND SO WHAT WE DID IS WE CAPITALIZED ON THAT TO DO QUICK DEPLOYMENTS RELATED TO HEALTHY STREETS AND THEN THE OTHER -- ACTUALLY THE BIGGEST TICK ITEM M IS RELATED TO THE TRAFFIC CALMING FOR FERNWOOD. JUST TO CLARIFY WHAT THE INTENT IS. THE 60,000 THAT GOES TOWARDS HEALTHY STREETS TO DOWNTOWN, THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY ANY BUDGET CHANGE RELATED TO THAT SPECIFIC ITEM. THAT IS JUST MAKING THAT PART OF THAT CONTRIBUTION -- [ NO AUDIO ] THAT'S COMING FROM THE DDA. AGAIN, SINCE THAT IS DIPPING INTO THE CADILLAC CONTRACT, THE WHYED IS TAK THAT PARTHOLE AGAIN. ON THE NEIGHBORHOOD SLOW STREETS, WHEN COUNCIL AUTHORIZED THAT BACK IN MAY, YOU MAY RECALL THAT COUNCIL GAVE DIRECTIVE TO THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR TO IMPLY THE PROGRAM AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. COUNCIL NEVER GAVE US A BUDGET FOR THE NEIGHBORHOOD SLOW STREETS PROGRAM. SO THE AMOUNT THAT YOU SEE REFLECTED IN THE RESOLUTIO RELAD TO THE THAT NEIGHBORHOOD SLOW STREETS IS HOW MUCH WE SPENT OPEN THAT TO DATE. AGAIN, THAT WAS IMPLEMENTED THROUGH CADILLAC, BECAUSE THEY HAD ALL OF THE MATERIALS THROUGH THEMSELVES AND THROUGH THEIR SUBCONTRACTORS TO PUT THAT INTO MACE. N -- PLACE.NOW THE ONE THAT IS T ADJUSTMENT IS HEALTHY STREETS ON MAJOR STREETS OUTSIDE OF DOWNTOWN WHICH IS UP FOR CONSIDERATION LATER ON THE AGENDA TONIGHT AS WELL. WHEN WE INITIALLY WENT TO COUNCIL WITH THAT, WE HAD AN ESTIMATION OF ABOUT $15,000. AND THAT WAS PART OF THE RESOLUTION THAT COUNCIL APPROVED. THAT COST ADMITTEDLY HAS COME IN HIGHER. IT'S FAIRLY UNPRECEDENTED TIMES AND WE HAD SOME SPECIAL SIGN MANUFACTURING AND SOME OF THE DEPLOYMENTS WERE A LITTLE BIT MORE ROBUST, WE FELT WAS WARRANTED THAN WHAT WE INITIALLY ANTICIPATED. SO OUT OF ALL THE DIFFERENT COMPONENTS OF THIS CHANGE ORDER, IT'S REALLY THE LAST ONE THAT IS A FOUG NOTABLE BUDGET CHANGE. IT'S TO MAKE IT WHOLE AGAIN AS IT WERE BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN DIPPING INTO THAT TO IMPLEMENT THESE THINGS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND THE ONLY ONE THAT REALLY IS A SUBSTANTIVE BUDGET CLANG IS THE HEALTHY STREETS OUTSIDE OF DOWNTOWN ON MAJOR STREETS. DOES THAT ADDRESS YOUR QUESTION, COUNCILMEMBER?
01:01:59.620: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES, IN READING THROUGH COUNCILMEMBER LUMM'S COMMENTS ON THIS, REALLY, LIKE YOU SAID, THAT THAT ONE PART OF IT, COST US MORE THAN WE ANTICIPATED. WE THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE 15 AND IT WAS 26, AM I READING THAT CORRECTLY?
01:02:32.286: >> THE NEIGHBORHOOD SLOW STREETS WAS NEVER FUNDED. THIS IS TO ADDRESS THAT PART.
01:02:36.123: >> Councilmember Hayner:  AND THAT'S $26,000 SOME, ALMOST $27,000? THEN WHY DOES IT SAY THAT THERE'S A BUDGET NEXT TO IT? DID YOU INTERNALLY.
01:02:48.268: >> WE ARE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH TWO DIFFERENT THINGS FOR PARTS OF THIS RESOLUTION. ONE IS TO MAKE THE CADILLAC CONTRACT WHOLE. SO THAT ANYTHING THAT WE HAVE KIND OF USED TO DO THOSE IMPLEMENTATIONS, IT CAN GO BACK TO THE CONTRACT A WE CAN GIVE THE PROPER BUDGET FOR THOSE DEPLOYMENTS, RIGHT, BECAUSE SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE PAID FOR OUT OF STREET RESURFACING, FOR EXAMPLE, MAY NOT BE APPROPRIATE FOR TRAFFIC CALMING AS AN EXAMPLE. AND SO JUST MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE KIND OF THE PROPER BUDGETS IDENTIFIED FOR EACH OF THOSE DIFFERENT WORK ELEMENTS AND THEN THE OTHER THING IS, ISO REFLECWHAT THE ACTUALOSTS HAVE BEEN. SO THE NEIGHBORHOOD SLOW STREETS, AGAIN SLOWING WHAT THOSE COSTS HAVE BEEN AND THEN ON THE HEALTHY STREETS OUTSIDE OF DOWNTOWN, KIND OF SHORING THAT UP AND SHOWING WHAT THE COSTS HAVE BEEN ON THAT AS. WITH PGH >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER SO HEALTHY STREETS OUTSIDE OF DOWNTOWN, SO THAT WAS 43. SO YOU'RE SAYING THE COST TO IMPLEMENT THESE WAS ALMOST $70,000? SO FAR? AM I READING THAT CORRECTLY? YOU SEE WHAT I'M ASKING. IT'S NOT YOUR EXPLANATION. WHENHIS SHUFFLING GOES ON, IT'S CONFUSING TO ME, AND I'M SORRY, EVERYBODY ELSE GO AHEAD AND SUPPORT IT IF YOU WANT BUT I DON'T GET IT. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY IT COSTS SO MUCH MORE. WHY WOULD WE HAVE GIVEN AN OPEN THING, WE HAVE SO MANY NEEDS AND SO MANY SWACK GAPS AND LIGHTING NEEDS. WE SPENT $70,000, GO AHEAD AND DO WHAT YOU G T D WITH THESE CONES? I'M SORRY I'M NOT CATCHING ON WHAT IS GOING ON HERE. I'M STILL DISSATISFIED WITH THE NUMBERS AND I WILL VOTE NO ON THIS.
01:04:41.548: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:04:42.416: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, MAYOR. YOU KNOW, I FIND IT OBVIOUSLY TROUBLING MYSELF WITH T PART THAT IS RELATED TO THE STREETS OUTSIDE OF DOWNTOWN. WE WERE GIVEN A FIGURE OF $15,000 AND IT MADE IT SEEM VERY INNOCUOUS WHEN IT CAME TO THE FINANCIAL IMPACT, AND NOW WE'RE LOOKING AT SOMETHING THAT'S THREE TIMES THE ORIGINAL STILTED ESTIMATED PCE. DON'T KNOW HOW W MISSED THE MARK BY THREE TIMES AND THAT TO ME IS CONCERNING. I JUST -- YOU KNOW, I KNOW THIS HAS BEEN INITIATED AND WE NEED TO BE WITH OUR WORD AND PAY OUR VENDORS AND OUR CONTRACTORS, BUT I'M DISAPPOINTED THAT WE WERE GIVEN ONE FIGURE AND THEN THE ACTUAL AMOUNT IS THREE TIMES GREATER. THAT'S SIGNIFICANT VARIANCE BY THREE MULTIPLES. IF WE WERE TO END THAT PROGRAM EARLY, WOULD ANY -- WOULD THERE BE ANY REDUCTION IN THAT AMOUNT OR ARE WE GOING TO BE PAYING THAT AMOUNT REGARDLESS OF DURATION OF THAT PILOT PROGRAM WHEN IT COMES TO THOSE THREE SEGMENTS THAT ARE UP FOR DISCUSSION TONIGHT?
01:06:11.371: >> COUNCICOUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI,I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER FOR YOU ON THAT. I KNOW THERE'S NO ADDITIONAL COST TO REMOVE T BARRICADES OR THE CONES IF THAT'S THE DIRECTION THAT COUNCIL PROVIDES TONIGHT. THERE IS A MAINTENANCE COMPONENT AS PART OF THE CONTRACT WITH CADILLAC, WHERE THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO GO OUT AND MONITOR THE DEPLOYMENTS ON A DAILY BASIS AND MAKE SURE TO RESTORE ANY OF THE CONES OR BARRELS OR BARRICADES THAT MAY HAVE SHIFTED. I'M NOT CERTAIN WITH THAT MAINTENANCE FEE COULD BE EDITED BACK. TH'S A PIECE I'M NOT TOO FAMILIAR WITH THE SPECIFICS OF THE CONTRACT TO KNOW IF THAT WOULD BE ELIGIBLE TO GET KIND OF A REBATE OR A DISCOUNT ON THAT.
01:06:48.875: >> AND IF I CAN JUMP IN ON THE ESTIMATE, UNDERSTAND THAT THE ESTIMATE WAS PRODUCED QUICKLY AND WE DID NOT KNOW EXACTLY THE NUMBER OF STREETS THAT WOULD BE USED IN THE HEALTHY STREETS OUTSIDE OF THE DOWNTOWN. SO IT WAS BASED UPON AN ESTIMATE OF THE NUMBER OF STREETS AND I'M LOOKING AT RAYMOND, BUT I THINK WE ENDED UP DOING MORE STREETS THAN WE THOUGHT WE WOULD.
01:07:18.071: >> YES, ESPECIALLY ON THE NEIGHBORHOOD SLOW STREETS PORTION, AS MR. HUPY JUST MENTIONED, YOU KNOW, IT WAS KIND OF -- WE DID KNOW HOW MUCH INTEREST THERE WOULD BE IN THE COMMUNITY FOR THOSE. WE HAVE SHUT DOWN ANY NEW REQUESTS FOR NEIGHBORHOOD SLOW STREETS. THERE'S A TA TIMING ISSUE OF HOW LONG THEY CAN BE DEPLOYEDEN ATHE COSTS ASSOCIATED FOR IT AS WELL. DID, -- DEPLOYED AND THE COSTS ASSOCIATED FOR IT AS WELL. AND THEN, YEAH, I THINK, YOU KNOW, TO THE POINT THAT MR. HUPY BROUGHT UP TOO, EVEN FOR THE HEALTHY STREETS ON MAJOR STREETS, YOU KNOW, ADMITTEDLY, THERE WAS A MISCALCULATION AND I WILL TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT. I THINK IT WAS  THE DEPLOYMENTS WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WERE MORE ROBUST THAN INITIALLY ANTICIPATED AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT DROVE THE COST UP.
01:08:15.528: >> W>> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I APPRECIATE THE TAKING THE OWNERSHIP OF WHERE THINGS ARE AT, BUT I WILL SAY THAT IT REALLY HAS A MAJ MAJOR INFLUENCN MY DECISION, WHEN IT COMES TO THESE THINGS WITH THE PRICE TAG. YOU KNOW? SO WHEN SOMETHING SAYS $15,000 VERSUS $44,000, IT DOES HAVE AN IMPACT ON MY DECISION OF SUPPORTING SOMETHING OR NOT SUPPORTING SOMETHING. AND, YOU KNOW, I JUST WOULD ASK THAT IF THERE'S GOING TO BE THAT SIGNIFICANT OF A CHANGE, PERHAPS MAYBE WE SCALE DOWN THE SCOPE THAT WAS ORIGINALLY BUDGETED FOR AND SO TO GO THREE TIMES OVER THE AMOUNT BECAUSE THE SCOPE WAS EXPANDED OPEN THE MAJOR STREETS I JUST -- IT GIVES ME HEARTBURN TO SPEND TAXPAYER DOLLARS WITHOUT PERMANENT, YOU KNOW, IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR INFRASTRUCTURE. AGAIN, AS I NOTED IN COUNCIL COMMUNICATIONS, THE IMPROVEMENTS MADE ON MILLER, I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH THAT COST, BUT IT -- IF WE'RE -- I SUSPECT IT WILL PROBABLY BE LESS THAN $43,000. I THINK THAT RIGHT THERE IS MONEY WELL SPENT.
01:09:33.840: >> MR. DEMAN IS HERE, HE CAN TALK TO THE MAINTENANCE, THE COST OF CONTINUING MAINTENANCE OF THE CONTROL -- THE TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
01:09:47.520: >> THANK YOU, MR. HUPY. I CAN SPEAK TO THAT BRIEFLY. THERE WOULD BE NO COST SAVINGS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT. THE WAY THAT PROJECT WAS AND THOSE ITE WE BID, IT'S AN ONGOING MAINTENANCE ROUTINE AS PART OF THAT WORK. THE AMOUNTS THAT WERE PROVIDED AND SOME OF THAT COST ALSO INCLUDES SOME CONTINGENCY WORK, WHICH THIS COULD BE POTENTIAL COST SAVINGS RELATED TO THAT. THERE'S NO ADDITIONAL WORK ASSOCIATED TO THIS.
01:10:15.949: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, DAVID.
01:10:20.086: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
01:10:20.987: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I JUST WANT TO -- I WANT TO SAY TO MY COLLEAGUES, I KNOW I DON'T ALWAYS EXPRESS MYSELF PROPERLY. I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S THIS ONE CONSENT AGENDA ITEM HAS WRAPPED UP THREE DIFFERENT TRANSPORTATION SPENDING ISSUES, THE FERNWOOD PROJECT, THE CADILLAC CONTRACT, AND THE ADDITIONAL COSTS OF THIS HEALTHY I GSS WHAT IOULD LIKE TO SAY IS THAT I THINK THAT BECAUSE I -- IT'S THE PERSONAL HOBBY OF MINE TO FIND OUT HOW MANY BUDGET OVERRIDES AND FOR WHAT REASON WE DO THEM, I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THESE THINGS KIND OF -- I THINK IT WOULD BE LESS CONFUSING FOR OUR BOOKKEEPING IF WE TREATED THESE AS SEPARATE ITEMS IN THE FUTURE. I GUESS I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT. SO TNK YOU FOR RECOGNIZING THIS.
01:11:06.166: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
01:11:07.400: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANKS, MR. MAYOR. I APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION AND THE QUESTIONS. AS YOU COULD SEE FROM MY QUESTIONS I SUBMITTED ABOUT THIS, IT WASN'T CLEAR TO ME, WHY THE COSTS WERE BEING TREATED AS A CHANGE ORDER, THE RESURFACING CONTRACT, AND THE RESPONSE TO AT QUESTIONHAT THE I AMENDMENT ENSURES COST FOR RESURFACE, AND THE RESURFACING IS NOT REDUCED. I WILL BE SUPPORTING IT. IT WASN'T CLEAR BECAUSE THE CHANGE ORDERS RELATED TO THE WORK AND THE COST FOR THE HEALTHY STREETS PROGRAM AND FOR THE TRAFFIC CALMING ON FERNWOOD AND NOT THE STREETESURFANG. IT I Y -- YOU KNOW, ITS A FARE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT 110,000 FOR HEALTHY STREETS, NEIGHBORHOOD SLOW STREETS, HEALTHY STREETS DOWNTOWN AND HEALTHY STREETS OUTSIDE DOWNTOWN, I DID ASK IF THAT REPRESENTED THE TOTAL EXPENDITURES. IT DOES COVER THE COST TO UNWIDE THE PROGRAM BUT IT IS DOESN'T INCLUDE THE STAFF COSTS. THE COSTS ARE GREATER THAN THIS. AND THESE COSTS ARE JUST FOR THE CONES, BARRICADES, BARRELS, PAVEMENT MARKINGS AND OTHER EFFORTS RELATED TO THE PROGRAM. WE KNOW FROM THE DOWNTOWN STREET PROGRAM, WEEKEND CLOSURES THAT, YEAH, BARCADES AND -- THE -- THE MATERIALS USED TO CLOSE THE STREETS -- AS COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI SAID, I APPRECIATE YOU TAKING OWNERSHIP, MR. HESS FOR THE UNDERESTIMATEDOST FOR THIS PROGRAM, BUT I THINK THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN A FAIR INDICATOR THAT THE COSTS WOULD BE, YOU KNOW, SOMEWHAT MORE SUBSTANTIAL AND THEY ARE A LOT MORE SUBSTANTIAL. BUT, AGAIN, YOU TOOK OWNERSHIP, AND THIS CLARITY GOING FORWARD SHOULD BE PROVIDED FOLKS. THK YOU.

01:18:04.417: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER 879. CALLER 879.
01:18:15.328: >> HELLO. CAN YOU HEAR ME?
01:18:17.096: >> Mayor Taylor: YES, WE CAN.
01:18:19.565: >> HELLO?
01:18:19.866: >> Mayor Taylor: WE CAN HEAR YOU.
01:18:20.666: >> THANK YOU. I'M WITH ALLEN CREEK WATER SHED GROUP. I WANT TO CALL AND SAY THAT THE ALLEN CREEK DOES NOT REPORT THIS. WE ATTENDED MOST OF THE DEVELOPER MEETINGS AND MADE MANY OF THESE COMMENTS AT THESE MEETINGS. RECENTLY "THE NEW YORK TIMES" HAS PUBLISHED THE REPORTS FROM THE FIRST STREET FOUNDATION THAT SHOW WHAT CALCULATIONS THAT THEY ARE DOING AND MAKING AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC NOW AND INCLUDING SEA LEVEL RISE AND RAINFALL AND SMALLER CREEKS, AND NOTAPS AND ESTIMATES 14.6 MILLION PROPERTIES ARE AT RISK AND WHAT EXPERTS CALL 100 YEAR FLOOD, FOR MORE THAN THE 8.7 MILLION FLOODS. PREVIOUSLY THIS DATA WAS AVAILABLE TO REAL ESTATE AND YOU CAN ENR AND GET FLOOD INFORMATION ABOUT THAT ADDRESS. FOR THIS ADDRESS, THE FIRST STREET FOUNDATION HAS THE EXTREME FLOOD FACTOR WHICH IS THE HIGHEST FOR THE RATING SYSTEM. JERRY HANCOCK HAS AS' FRONT-LINE MAGER HE WOULD NOT LIKE TO SEE BUILDINGS IN THE FLOODPLAIN. HE HAS SAID DURING THE RECENT FLOODPLAIN OVERLAY, JUST DOWNSTREAM OF A DAM SPOOKS HIM. AND MISSY STULTS AT AN A2ZERO KICKOFF MEETING, WHEN ASKED SAID SHE DOES NOT SUPPORT BUILDING THE FLOODPLAIN ALSO. THE CITY HAS AT VOTED FOR 1 BILLION A2ZERO PROGRAM, DUEL TO THE EFFECTS OF GLOBAL WARMING WHICH INCLUDES MUCH LARGER RAIN EVENTS AND MORE FLOODING, THE CITY HAS PROTECTION OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY AS A VALID RATIONALE FOR REJECTING PROPOSALS. ADDITIONALLY, THE DEVELOPER HAS NO PLANS FOR FULL CLEANUP OF THE SITE, PLANS TO BUILD CONDOS AND HOTELS, AND COLE TAFT SITE AND OTHER POLLUTIONS AS WELL. THERE WAS A FULL CLEANUP OF A PORTION OF THE SITE WHERE THEY RECENTLY INSTALLED A TRAIL, WHICH IS GREAT AND I'M GLAD TO SEE THAT. DTE THAT OWNS THIS PROPERTY, S A $42 BILLION COMPANY AND IT HAS A RESPONSIBLE PARTY AND BUILDING OWNER. THE PROPOSED POE HUTTER PAYABLE MAKES VERY DIFFICULT IF IMPOSSIBLE TO CLEAN THIS UP WHEN POLLUTER PAY DOES PASS IN THE STATE. THE DEVELOPER DID NOT INCLUDE THE 100 YEAR FLOOD ANALYSIS. 1968, 100 YEAR FLOOD HAD 15 FEET OF WATER FLOWING ACROSS THIS SITE. IT MEANS A VERY DANGEROUS SITE, AND IT'S JUST FAIR CONDITION ASSESSMENT BY THE STATE. I THINK THIS SITE WOULD MAKE A GREAT PARK. I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE IT CLEANED UP. IT'S GOT COAL TAR 30 FEET DOWN IN THE SOIL AT GROUNDWATER AND THEY HAVE NOT TESTED THE GRNDWATEDOWNSTREAM OF THE SITE. I THINK WE NEED TO DO A CLEANUP. I THINK WE ARE MOVING THAT WAY AS A STATE TO CLEAN UP THESE LINES.
01:22:03.656: >> Clerk Beaudry: MAYOR, THAT'S TIME.
01:22:05.591: >> AND NOT LEAVE IT FOR LATER GENERATIONS. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
01:22:13.933: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING?
01:22:23.008: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER 534.
01:22:29.348: >> GOOD EVENING. THIS IS TOM STALBERG. A LIVE AT 1202 TRAVER STREET. TONIGHT, I'M SPEAKING FOR MYSELF. I'M SUPPORTING TS PROJECT AT 841 BROADWAY. I DO NOT DISAGREE WITH MY FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS ABOUT THE HOTEL LOCATION AND HEIGHT AND ABOUT THE FLOOD AND THE CONTAMINATION ISSUES. BUT GIVEN THAT THE PUD AND THE AREA PLAN HAVE ALREADY BEEN APPROVED, I'M SUPPORTING THIS NEXT STEP. 841 BROADWAY IS A LARGE AND VERY COMPLEX PROJECT. IT'S ALONG THE RIVER FRONT AND ALSO ALONG THE RAILROAD TRACKS. IT WILL CONTAIN TRUE MIXED USE, RESIDENTIAL, HOTEL AND A COUPLE OF RESTAURANTS AND OTHER SMALL RETAIL AND BOTH ACTIVE AND PASSIVE PARK SPACES OPEN TO THE PUBLIC. THE SITE WILL BECOME MORE INTERCONNECTED AND INTE INTERCOC THE MAIN STREET AREA AND THE ARGARGO LIVERY AREA. I SEE THIS AS A PASST POSITIVE E AREA. THIS IS A LUXURY DEVELOPMENT BUT IT WILL PAY A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY TO THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUND. I KNOW THE HOTEL IS TALL AND CLOSE TO THE BRIDGE AND CLOSE TO THE RIVER, AND IF I COULD CHANGE ANYTHING ABOUT IT AND I'M NOT IGNORING FLOOD ISSUES. I REFLECT MY FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS WHO HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT THOSE. OVERALL, I FEEL THIS DEVELOPER IS A DEVELOPER WHO IS PLAYING BY THE RULESND FOLLOWI THE INTENT, AS WELL AS THE LETTER OF OUR ZONING LAWS AND MASTER PLAN. AS THOROUGHLY ENGAGED WITH THE PUBLIC AND EARNED A CERTAIN LEVEL OF TRUST FROM US. I THINK THE OVERALL PROJECT IS A VERY GOOD ONE, EVEN WITH THE NEGATIVES. THANK YOU.
01:24:25.331: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
01:24:35.374: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER 677, DID YOU HAVE A COMMENT? CALLER 677, YOUR PHONE IS MUTED. THERE YOU GO.
01:24:46.085: >> OH, HEY. SORRY. YEAH, THIS IS MICHELLE HUES ANDD I WANTED TO SAY, I'M EXCITED ABOUT THIS PROJECT AND I TAKE MY DOG FOR A WALK DOWN BY THE ARGO CASCADES AND I'M EXCITED THAT THIS WILL BRING MORE VITALITY THERE AND MAKE IT A MORE EXCITING PLACE TO BE. AND I'M -- AND I'M EXCITED THAT IT HAPPENED. THANKS.
01:25:13.178: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
01:25:20.819: >> Clerk Beaudry: MAYOR, THERE ARE OTHER CALLERS ON THE LINE BUT THEY DON'T HAVE THEIR HANDS UP.
01:25:24.356: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU VERY MUCH, IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING, PLEASE ENTER STAR NINE NOW. STAR NINE. IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK ATHIS PUBLIC HEARING.
01:25:47.780: >> Clerk Beaudry: THERE ARE NO OTHER CALLERS WITH THEIR HANDS UP FOR THIS MEETING.
01:25:51.717: >> Mayor Taylor: SEEING NO ONE THIS PUBLIC HEARING IS CLOSED. WE HAVE BEFORE US THE MINUTES OF THE SPECIAL WORK SESSION OF AUGUST 20, THE SPECIAL SESSION OF AUGUST 24 AND 26, AND THE REGULAR SESSION MEETING MINUTES OF SEPTEMBER 8, ALL 2020. MAY HAVE A MOTION TO APPROVE THESE MINUTES, MOVED BY RAMLAWI, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER SMITH. DISCUSSION OF THE MINUTES? ALL  IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? THE MINUTES ARE APPROVED. C, IS AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND CHAPTER 55, UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE, REZONING OF 12.8 ACRES FROM PL PUBLIC LAND TO PUD PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT, VERIDIAN, AT COUNTY FARM PUD ZONING AND SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS 2270. 2270 PLATT RD. MOVED BY LUMM AND SECONDED BY ACKERMAN. MR. ACKERMAN.
01:26:44.470: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THIS IS AN UNUSUAL NIGHT WE HAVE TWO PRETTY TRANSFORMATIVE REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENTS BEFORE US. AND THIS IS THE FIRST. WHEN CONSTRUCTED VER INDIVIDUALIAN COUNTY FARM PARK WILL BE THE MOST IMPORTANT REAL ESTATE PJECT WEAVE WORKED ON. IT'S REAL. IT'S TANGIBLE AND IT'S HERE NOW, NOT TEN YEARS FROM NOW. OUR COMMUNITY HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE THE SITE OF A DECOMMISSIONED JUVENILE DETENTION CENTER AND BUILD THE GREENEST AND ONE OF THE MOST EQUITABLE NEIGHBORHOODS NOT ONLY IN THE CITY, COUNTY AND STATE, BUT REALLY IN THE ENTIRE GREAT LAKESEGION. TAKE A MOMENT TO STEP BACK AND THINK ABOUT THE MAGNITUDE. WE CAN TAKE A SITE ON WHICH STRUGGLING KIDS WERE SEGREGATED FROM SOCIETY AND TURN THAT LAND INTO A NEIGHBORHOOD BUILT FOR PEOPLE OF EVERY INCOME LEVEL THAT PRODUCES MORE ENERGY VIA SOLAR POWER THAN IT CONSUMES. THEN THE DEVELOPERS PUT IN THE WORK TO MAKE EVERYTHING BEAUTIFUL THROUGH THE SITE, ARCHITECTURAL AND LANDSCAPING DESIGN, SOMETHING THAT WE DON'T ALWAYS SEE. WHEN WE NEGOTIATE WITH OTHER DEVELOPERS AT THE PLANNING COMMISSION TABLE AT THE CITY COUNCIL TABLE TO MAKE INCREMENTAL IMPROVEMENTS TO THEIR PROJECTS, SOMETIMES WE'RE SUCCESSFUL AND SOMETIMES WE ARE NOT, BUT I THINK EACH OF US HAS AT THE PROJECT LIKE THIS IN MIND WHEN THEY START THOSE NEGOTIATIONS. THIS IS THE IDEAL STATE, THIS IS THE VISION FOR HOW PEOPLE NEED TO LIVE IN THE FUTURE. SO THANK YOU TO MR. GROKOF AND MR. PATINO, FROM THRIVE COLLECTIVE AND AVALON FOR THEIR VISION AND PERSISTENCE OVER THESE LAST FOUR YEARS THANK YOU TO TOO TO THE NEIGHBORS FOR ORGANIZING THEMSELVES IN SUPPORT OF THIS PROJECT. SITTING IN THE THIRD WARD WHICH I REPRESENT, I HAVE SEEN A LOT OF INCREDIBLE LEADERSHIP COME FROM NEIGHBORS. WHEN I RAN FOR ELECTION, RY DIVISIVEAMPAIGN ISSUE.E A INSTEAD NEIGHBORS LIKE JEANINE PALMS SAW THIS PROJECT AS AN OPPORTUNITY AND SAW WHAT IT COULD MEAN FOR THE IMMEDIATE NEIGHBORHOOD, AS WELL AS THE WORLD. AND REALLY RALLIED A LOT OF GREAT LOCAL SUPPORT FOR THE SALE, FROM THE COUNTY AND NOW THE DEVELOPMENT I WOULD BE VERY HAPPY AND PROUD TO RIGHT FOR THIS TONIGHT, AS WELL AS SUPPORT IT AGAIN AT SECOND READING. SO THAT'S MY STATEMENT, AND THEN WITH, THAT I ALSO WANT TO MOVE AN AMENDMENT, MORE OF A CLEANUP THAN ANYTHING. BUT I WANT TO ADD A SECTION OR A NUMBER SEVEN TO SECTION 4 OF THE PUD SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS, WHICH WOULD READ 11 OUTDOOR LIGHTING TO ENABLE OUTDO LITING TO ELIMINATE LIGHT POLLUTION AND REDUCE ENERGY, ANY EXTERIOR LIGHTING SHOULD BE DARK SKY COMPLIANT AND SHALL NOT BE SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF CHAPTER 55 SECTION 5.25.3 PARKING LOTS.
01:29:51.123: >> Mayor Taylor: SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRAND. IS THAT FRIENDLY TO THE BODY, THAT AMENDMENT? THAT AMENDMENT IS FRIENDLY. COUNCILMBER ACKERMAN, YOU STILL HAVE THE FLOOR.
01:29:58.997: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THAT'S EVERYTHING FROM ME. THIS IS COMMUNITY CHANGING.
01:30:04.970: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
01:30:07.673: >> Councilmember Lumm: THIS WAS A SIGNIFICANT PROJECT AT THE COUNTY FARM PROJECT BETWEEN WASHTENAW AND HURON PARKWAY AND ALTHOUGH TONIGHT IS JUST FIRST READING ON THE ZONING, I BIEVE IT'S IMPORNT TO DISCUSS THE PROJECT TO LET RESIDENTS KNOW THAT IT'S ON THE RADAR SCREEN. THE PROPOSAL IS TO UTILIZE THE 12.8-ACRE SITE OWNED BY THE COUNTY THAT AS COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN NOTED FORMALLY HOUSED THE JUVENILE DETENTION AND FAMILY COURT FACILITY, FOR AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND MIXED INCOME RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT. ROETHLISBERTHE PROPOSED ZONING S APPROPRIATE. THE PLAN IS TO DIVIDE THE PROPERTY WITH TWO PROJECTS A NORTH AND A SOUTH. THE NORTH PROJECT WOULD BE 50 UNITS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND NINE TWO-STORY BUILDINGS, MANAGED BY AVALON HOUSING. THE SOUTH PROJECT WOULD BE 99 UNITS OF MARKET RATE HOUSING OF VARYING SIZES AND NUMBER OF BEDROOMSHAWOULD BE AFFORDABLE TO A RANGE OF INCOME LEVELS. THE MAXIMUM COMBINED DENSITY OF THE PROJECT, IS -- OF THE TWO PROJECTS IS 16 UNITS AN ACRE WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO R4B ZONING. THE PROJECTS ARE UNIQUE IN THAT THEY ARE AT ADVANCED LABELS OF SUSTAINABILITY AND EFFICIENCY. IT WILL SEEK DESIGNATION AS A LIVING PROJECT AND WILL SEEK AN ENTERPRISED GREEN CERTIFICATION. THIS IS TONIGHT'S FIRST READING ON THE ZONING DESIGNATION, WHICH I WILL SUPPORT THE FINAL APPROVAL OF THE ZONING. A PUBLIC HEARING WILL COME LATER BUT I ALSO WANTED TO DISCUSS IT SINCE IT IS SUCH A SIGNIFICANT PROPOSAL ANESTHESIA RENT IT'S AE AWARE OF THIS, ONCE THE PUBLIC HEARING IS SCHEDULED. THANK YOU.
01:32:06.058: >> Councilmember Grand: I WILL BE BRIEF SINCE THIS IS THE FIRST READING. JUST ALL THANKS TO THE DEVELOPERS WHO WORKED ON THE PROJECT. I THINK WE HAVE TWO INCREDIBLE EXAMPLES OF HOW TO ENGAGE THE COMMUNITY ON A DEVELOPMENT PROJECT BEFORE US THIS EVENING. AND TO SEE THE TRANSFORMATION FROM, YOU KNOW, SIGNS UP IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD ABOUT SAVING OUR LAND, TO UNDERSTANDING AND TO SEE THAT BROAD BASED COMMUNITY SUPPORT. NOT 100%, BUT CERTAINLY TO SEE SO MANY NEIGHBORS RALLY AND HAVE A DEEP INTEREST IN THIS PROJECT AND WANT TO SEE IT COME FORWARD AND HAVE ENTHUSIASM FOR IT. IT'S JUST A TESTAMENT TO THE DEVELOPERS. I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THIS COME TO FRUITION AND WHAT ELSE, I THINK THIS WILL SET JUST A TREMENDOUS EXAMPLE FOR WHAT WE CAN DO, PERHAPS ON SOME OF OUR CITY-OWNED PROPERTIES, AND ONE GROUP THAT HASN'T BEEN THANKED IS MEMBERS OF THE COMNITY W HAVE H THE ABILITY TO TAKE A LOT OF CRITICISM AT THE BEGINNING AND WORK WITH THE COMMUNITY AND ALLOW THIS KIND OF TRANSFORM FORMATIVE PROJECT TO E PLACE. THEY WERE GREAT STEWARDS OF THIS LAND AND MADE SURE THAT IT WOULD CREATE THE GREATESTENEFIT TO THE COMMUNITY. THANK YOU FOR THAT.
01:33:37.048: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE MY COLLEAGUES' ENTHUSIASM WITH RESPECT TO THE -- WITH RESPECT TO THIS PROJECT MOVING FORWARD. I THINK THIS IT'S TRUE, THIS IS -- WELL, THIS WILL BE -- THIS IS GOING TO BE TRANSFORMATIVE. IT'S GOING TO BE, YOU KNOW, INSPIRATIONAL, I HOPEO US A A COMMUNITY, FOR -- YOU KNOW, WHAT CAN BE DONE, AND I HOPE TO OTHERS. YOU KNOW, OUTSIDE OF ANN ARBOR. IT'S GOING TO BE A MODEL AND I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE IT COME TO FRUITION. I WOULD LIKE TO AS CONSENT THANK THE DEVELOPERS FOR THEIR ENVISIONING AND COORDINATING AND LLABORATINGITH RESIDENTS. AND, OF COURSE, STAFF UP AND DOWN THE LINE BUT ALSO TO COUNTY FOR THEMSELVES HAVING TO USE THEIR LAND FOR THIS PURPOSE, TO IMPROVE AND BETTER THE COMMUNITY. FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] ALL OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. DC-1R. SOLUTION TO APPOINT ELIZABETH LILLARD TO THE GREENBELT ADVISORY COMMISSION. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRAND AND SECONDED BY ACKERMAN. DISCUSSION OF DC-1. ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. DC-2, RESOLUTION DECLARING THE INVESTIGATION AND THE ARREST OF INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED WITH THE PERSONAL USE, GROWTH, AND POSSESSION OF ENTHEOGENIC PLANTS, INCLUDING THOSE SCHEDULED AT STATE AND FEDERAL LEVELS BE THE LOWEST PRIORITY FOR THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER AND SECONDED BY HAYNER. DISCUSSION, PLEASE, OF DC-2? COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
01:35:21.987: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THE SPONSOR, IF YOU WANT TO GO FIRST.
01:35:28.693: >> Councilmember Hayner: THAT'S OKAY. ONLY TO BRIEFLY GIVE EVERYONE A HEADS UP THAT A I DISTRIBUTED A TEXT WITH THE RESULTS CLAUSE AND THE WHEREAS CLAUSES HAVE BEEN MODIFIED ONLY THAT WE REMOVED ALL THE FOOTNOTES TO MAKE FOR CLEAR READING. GO AHEAD, I WILL YIELD BACK. I MEAN, I HAVE TO MOVE TO SUBSTITUTE THE LANGUAGE SO --
01:36:03.495: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  I THINK IT MIGHT MAKE SENSE TO DISCUSS THAT, TO HAVE ONE CONVERSATION RATHER THAN TWO.
01:36:11.736: >> Mayor Taylor: DO YOU WANT TO MAKE THE MOTION.
01:36:13.505: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT ME TO READ IT, IN I DID SHARE IT THROUGH THE CLERK THAT WE SUBSTITUTE THE LANGUAGE WHOLE SHELL WITH THE LANGUAGE THAT I JUST SHARED WITH YOU, SPECIFICALLY IT AFFECTS THE RESOLVE CLAUSES. IT AFFECTS THE WHEREAS CLAUSES AND REMOVING THE FOOTNOTES AND TH RESOLVE CLAUSES HAVE CHANGED FROM WHAT WAS PUBLISHED IN LEGISTAR. SO I WOULD MOVE THAT THOSE -- I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT ME TO READ IT IN.
01:36:41.066: >> Mayor Taylor: PERHAPS READ THE ALTERED RESOLVE CLAUSE SO THE MEMBERS THE PUBLIC WILL HAVE A NOTION OF WHERE WE ARE GOING WITH THIS.
01:36:46.004: >> Councilmember Hayner: SURE. THAT'S FINE. SO BE IT RESOLVED THAT THE MAYOR AND THE CITY COUNCIL HEB DEARE IT'S THE POLICY OF THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR THAT THE INVESTIGATION AND THE ARRESTF PERSONS FOR PLANTING, CULTIVATING, PURCHASING, TRANSPORTING, ENGAGING IN PRACTICES WITH OR POSSESSING THE ENTHEOGENIC PLANTS OR PLANT COMPOUNDS ON THE FEDERAL SCHEDULE ONE LIST SHOULD BE THE LOWEST LAW ENFORCEMENT PRYORITYY FOR CITY OF ANN ARBOR AND THE MAYOR AND THE CITY CNCIL CALL UPON THE WASHTENAW COUNTY PROSECUTOR, AND BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED THAT THIS RESOLUTION DOES NOT ENABLE THE COMMISSION OF ANY CRIMES AND BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED ANY SIGNIFICANT WILL STATE OR FEDERAL LAW OR ANY USE OF ENTHEOGENIC PLANT THATOSE A THREAT TO THE HEALTH, THREAT TO THE CITIZENS SAFETY AND WELFARE AND THE FILE REMAINS THE SAME THAT IF ANY PROVISION OF THIS RESOLUTION IS DECLARED BY A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION BE CONTRARY TO ANY STATUTE, REGULATION OR JUDICIAL DECISION SO THAT THE APPLICABLE TO ANY AGENCY, PERSON OR CIRCUMSTANCES, THE VALIDITY OF THE REMAINDER O THIS RESOLUTION AND THE APPLICABLE TO ANY OTHER AGENCY, PERSON OR CIRCUMSTANCE SHALL NOT BE AFFECTED.
01:38:03.114: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THAT FRIENDLY TO THE BODY. IS THERE A SECOND? SECONDED BY RAMLAWI IS THAT FRIENDLY TO THE BODY? IT'S FRIENDLY. COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER, YOU STILL HAVE THE FLOOR. Councmember Hayne WELL, OKAY. I WAS HAPPY TO ASK ANN TO COSPONSOR. THIS ANN DID ALL THE LEG WORK ON THIS EARLY LAST SPRING WHEN THEY INTRODUCED ME TO THE FOLKS FROM DECRIMINALIZE ANN ARBOR, THE LOCAL CHAPTER AND MADE ME AWARE OF THE NATIONAL MOVEMENT UNDERWAY. I THINK THAT THESE PLANTS HAVE -- I THINK THE INTENT IS TO DECRIMINALIZE THE USE OF THIS AS BEST WE ARE ABLE AS A COUNCIL, TO ALLOW FOR PERSONAL USE AND GIVE THE FOLKS WHO ARE DOING CUTTING EDGE RESEARCH IN MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES TO HAVE MORE TOOLS AND REMOVE THE STIGMA AROUND THESE PLANTS AND KEEPING OF THESE PLANTS TO KEN WITH THE WHERE LKS ARE EXPERIMENTING AND USING THESE TO GREAT RELIEF IN DID IN END OF LIFE SITUATIONS. IT DOESN'T ENDORSE THE USE. WE ARE NOT SEEKING TO CREATE A TOURIST CLIMATE OR A COMMERCIAL CLIMATE AROUND USE. I KNOW SOME OTHER COUNTRIES IN EUROPE DO THIS AND AMSTERDAM ALLOWS THE SALE OF PSYCHEDELIC PLANTS AND THEY -- A FEW YEARS BACK THEY HAD SOME TROUBLE WITH IT AND FAMOUSLY THE MAYOR SAID WE DON'T HAVE THE PSYCHEDELIC PLANT PROBLEM, WE HAVE A TOURISM PROBLEM. WE ARE NOT TRYING TO ENDORSE ANY SORT OF CREATION, OTHER THAN T MOVE THE -- THE STIGMA LEGALLY THROUGH LAW ENFORCEMENT. WE HEARD SO MANY GOOD REASONS FROM THE FOLKS, MEDICINAL, SPIRITUAL, THAT IT PUTS US BACK IN TOUCH WITH NATURE AND THAT IT ENCOURAGES INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY AND RESPONSIBLE USE. AND SO THAT COMBINED WITH THE ADDICT TESTIFY AND THEYO NOT BE REPRESENT THIS GREAT BODY OF TRADITIONAL SEE COULD LOGICAL KNOWLEDGE. I ENCOURAGE MY COLLEAGUES TO SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION. THANK YOU.
01:40:17.048: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
01:40:18.483: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. SO I WILL BE HONEST, I TRIED TO AVOID THIS ISSUE WHEN IT FIRST CAME UP. MR. REAM IS A CONSTITUENT OF MINE, BUT HERECOD INVITED ME AND COUNCILMEMBER GRAND OUT TO COFFEE AND WE HAD A CONVERSATION, AND IT CAUSED ME TO START DIGGING INTO THE TOPIC FURTHER AND AFTER A LOT OF RESEARCH AIDED BY A PERSONAL FRIEND WHO IS A PSYCHOLOGY RESEARCHER, YOU KNOW, I HAVE FORMED AN OPINION WHICH I HOPE IS BASED IN LOGIC. FIRST OFLL I THINK TO THE PUBLIC WHO IS GOING TO INEVITABLY READ NEWSPAPER ARTICLES ABOUT THIS, I RECOGNIZE THAT THIS SEEMS LIKE A VERY SILLY TOPIC OF DEBATE. PSYCHEDELICS AT LARGE HAVE DEVELOPED A VERY SPECIAL AND GOOFY PLACE IN OUR NATIONAL CULTURE. AND THE LEGACY OF VERY MISGUIDED GOVERNMENT INITIATIVESIKE MXK ULTRA CAST A VERY LONG SHADOW. THIS REPRESENTS A SERIOUS DECISION. AFTER EXTENSIVE RESEARCH, YOU KNOW, I HAVE COME TO THE REALIZATION THAT YOU REALLY ONLY NEED TO SPEND ABOUT 15 MINUTES WITH THE MODERN RESEARCH ON PSYCHEDELIC MEDICINE TO REAL SIZEREALIZETHAT THIS IS A SERIOC WITH POTENTIALLY SERIOUS BENEFITS. TO GIVE SOME PERSPECTIVE, JOHNS HOPKINS A PREMIER MEDICAL RESEARCH UNIVERSITY JUST LAUNCHED A $17 MILLION CENTER DEDICATED EXCLUSIVE TO RESEARCHING THE MEDICAL BENEFITS OF THESE SUBSTANCES BECAUSE JOHNS HOPKINS AND THEIR DONORS SEE THE TREMENDOUS POTENTIALF THESE FUTURE MED SENS. IN PARTICULAR, THE MEDICAL RESEARCH AROUND SILSIBIN IS UNDENIABLY EXCITING. AS A PERSON IN LONG-TERM RECOVERY, THE ASTONISHING RESULTS OF STUDIES AMONG COCAINE ADDICTS, AND VETERANS WITH PTSD SEEM' SPECIALLY PROMISING. ULTIMATELY, TO BE VERY CLEAR, I THINK MEDICALIZATION IS THE MUCH MORE RESPONSIBLE ROUTE TO NORMALIZATION RATHER THAN DECRIMINALIZATION, OUT BUT I REE THAT DECRIMINALIZING THESE SUBSTANCES TODAY CAUSES MORE HARM THAN THE DECRIMINALIZATION WOULD CAUSE IN THE FUTURE. AND SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS TONIGHT. I THINK ALSO IN 2020, WE NEED TO BE LOOKING FOR WAYS TO DECREASE THE NUMBER OF POLICE INTERACTIONS THAT HAPPEN IN OUR COMMUNITY, AND DECRIMINALIZATION OF WHAT ARE GENERALLY SAFE SUBSTANCES ARE A PLACE TO START. NALLY -- AND COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER TOUCHED ON THIS, I DON'T BELIEVE THAT IT'S THE INTENT OF THESE ADVOCATES, BUT ANY FUTURE COUNCIL SHOULD BE VERY WEARY OF MOVES TO MAKE THESE SUBSTANCES RECREATIONAL. AGAIN, THEY ARE POWERFUL, AS I READ ABOUT THEM, BUT NEED TO BE HARNESSED, I BELIEVE FORECAST FR MEDICINE, MOST IMPORTANTLY.
01:43:30.708: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
01:43:35.113: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANKS FOR THAT, COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN. I AGREE. I THINK THAT -- I UNDERSTAND THAT -- THAT A MEDICAL ROUTE -- THE CLINICAL USE IS KIND OF WHAT WE A LOOKING AT AND WHAT THESE FOLKS MOSTLY EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN WITH THAT AND I GRANTSOLUTIONS AGREE WITH THAT.WE HEARD FAMOUSE EFFECTIVELY DECRIMINALIZE OTHER REDUCE THE CRIMINALIZATION OF MARIJUANA WITH A $5 FINE. WE CAN DO A THING LIKE THAT AND SAY WE RECOGNIZE THAT STATE AND FEDERAL LAW IS GOING TO KEEP THIS A CMINAL,UST LIKE IT DOES -- UNTIL RECENTLY STATE LAW, BUT FEDERAL -- JUST LIKE FEDERAL LAW CONTINUES TO DO FOR MARIJUANA. I THINK THAT TAKING THE STIGMA AWAY, REDUCING THE POLICE INTERACTIONS IS IMPORTANT AND SO, YEAH, WE ACTUALLY WENT AROUND WITH THE LANGUAGE YOU SPOKE TO THAT NOTION OF FUTURE BODIES BEING AWARE OF IT AND I ACTUALLY CSIDERED THATHOULD WE PUT SOMETHING IN THE LANGUAGE, TO TALK ABOUT THAT, BUT I THINK WE'LL LEAVE THAT FOR FUTURE BODIES AND WE HAVE SEEN THAT SO FAR, IT'S PLAYING OUT OKAY IN THE OTHER CITIES AND I DON'T KNOW IF CHIEF COX HAS ANYTHING TO SAY. I KNOW BACK IN THE SPRING ANN AND I SPOKE WITH YOU ABOUT THIS. AND WE HAD SOME ASSURANCES THAT IT ALREADY WAS SORT OF A LOW THING BECAUSE WE HAVE A VERY PROGRESSIVE COMMUNITY AND PROGRESSIVE POLICE LDERSHIP. I JUST -- THANKS FOR YOUR COMMENTS.
01:44:56.894: >> WELL, YOU KNOW, CERTAINLY, IT'S -- WE HAVE HAD ABOUT HONESTLY SIX ARRESTS FOR THIS SINCE 2017, AND THAT'S ZERO FOR THIS YEAR. SO THE RESOLUTION CURRENTLY IS IT PROBABLY REFLECTS THE REALITY OF WHAT WE ARE DOING AS FAR AS LOOKING INTO THIS. THE ONLY THING I WOULD EVER CAUTION IS THAT I WORRY SOMETIMES WHEN O YOU SHIFT THE PERSON FROM THE VIOLATION OF THE PERSON IN THE LAW FROM THAT PERSON TO THE PEOPLE WOULD ARE ENFORCING THE LAW. -- WHO ARE ENFORCING THE LAW. I CAUTION STUFF LIKE THAT, WHEN YOU DOTUFF. YOU KNOW WHEN THINGS ARE -- YOU HAVE THE ABILITY AT SOME POINT OR AT LEAST LEGALLY THAT THE STATE MIGHT HAVE THE ABILITY TO DECRIMINALIZE SOMETHING, AND THAT MIGHT BE AN ANSWER TO SOMETHING, BUT I JUST WORRY SOMETIMES WHEN WE SHIFT THAT BURDEN AROUND, PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF WHAT'S GOING ON NOWADAYS. OTHERWISE, THAT'S ABOUT ALL THAT I HAVE TO SAY.
01:46:03.294: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
01:46:06.497: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU, CHIEF COX. I APPRECIATE THAT WE ARE INCORPORATING THE ATTORNEY'S RECOMMENDATIONS. THE VARIOUS REVISIONS THAT WERE RECOMMENDED BY THE ATTORNEY TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNSHAT THE CITY SHOULD -- UTILIZING ANY RESOURCES OR DETENTION FOR PROSECUTION WAS NOT REASONABLE. THAT'S BEEN ADDRESSED OR APPROPRIATE, I AGREE WITH THAT. AND ALSO THAT THE CONCERN THAT THE LANGUAGE COULD HAVE BEHIHINDEREDTHE INVESTIGATION OE SERIOUSCTIVITIES A THAT'S BEEN ADDRESSED SEAN REVISING THE SECOND RESOLVE AS YOU DID MR. HAYNER SO THAT IT'S CLEAR THAT THE RESOLUTION DOESN'T AUTHORIZE THE COMMISSION OF ANY CRIMES. AND AS ORIGINALLY WRITTEN, A COUPLE OF OTHER SPECIFIC CRIMES WERE MENTIONED BUT IT AGAIN IT SHOULD BE UNAMBIGUOUS THAT IT SO TNK YOU FOR INCORPORATING. THOSE RECOMMENDED CHANGES. I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SUPPORT THE ARE ORIGINAL VERSION BECAUSE I SHARED THE CONCERNS EXPRESSED BY STAFF THAT IT WAS ORIGINALLY WRITTEN. THE POLICY COULD HAVE SERIOUS NEGATIVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES INCLUDING POTENTIALLY HINDERING THE AGAIN T IESTIGATION OF MORE SERIOUS CRIMES AND EXPOSE EGG THE CITY TO POTENTIAL LIABILITY. THOSE ARE RISKS THAT I DIDN'T FEEL THE CITY SHOULD BE TAKING BUT BY ADOPTING THE SUBSTITUTE VERSION, THOSE RISKS ARE DRAMATICALLY MITIGATED AND TO BE REAL HONEST, I'M NOT PARTICULARLY COMFORTABLE HEADING DOWN PATH WHERE WE SELECTIVELY ENFORCE LAWS UNTIL THE POLICE -- WHAT LAWS THEY SHOULD BE SERIOUS ABOUT AND WHAT ARE LOWER PRIORITIES. I DID ASK IF THERE WERE OTHER EXAMPLES WHERE THE CITY HAD DECLARED ENFORCEMENT OF A LAW A LOW PRIORITY AND THE ANSWER WAS NO, THAT THIS IS FIRST. I KNOW OTHERS WILL DISREE, BUT IUST DON'T BELIEVE THAT THAT'S A GOOD PRECEDENT TO SET OR THE RIGHT APPROACH. IN MY VIEW, I BELIEVE IT'S MUCH BETTER TO LOBBY TO HAVE THE LAWS CHANGED THAN TO SET A POLICY THAT ENFORCEMENT IS THE LOWEST PRIORITY. WE CERTAINLY HEARD FROM A LOT -- TONIGHT INCLUDED, ADVOCATES FOR ADDRESSING THIS IN THIS FASHION. AND I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU SHARED COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN ABOUT YOUR MEETING WITH MR. REAM. AND ALSO SHARE YOUR -- THE FACT THAT YOU WERE PERSUASIVELY CONVINCED THAT THIS IS AN OKAY PATH TO FOLLOW IS COMPELLING TO ME, IN ADDITION TO, AGAIN, THE FACT THAT THE CHANGES INCORPORATE THE ATTORNEY'S RECOMMENDATIONS. SO I APPRECIATE THAT WE HAVE THE SUBSTITUTE VERSION ON THE TABLE. I ALSO -- YOU KNOW, I KNOW THAT THE SPONSORS FEEL PASSIONATE ABOUT THIS, AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS. I -- WITH THE SUBSTITUTE VERSION, I BELIEVE I CAN SEE MY WAY TO A YES ON THE RESOLUTION AND I DO THINK THAT IS -- IT'S AN IMPORTANT CAVEAT THAT YOU TOUCHED UPON, COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN THAT THIS IS TINNEDDED FOR MEDICALLY PRESCRIBED USES NOT RECREATIONAL. I'M A LOT OLDER THAN A NUMBER OF YOU AND I LIVED THROUGH THOSE DAYS. DIDN'T PERSONALLY IMBIBE WITH PSYCHEDELIC MUSHROOMS BUT I CERTAINLY, YOU KNOW, INTERACTED WITH PEOPLE WHOD. I WILL JUST SAY IT, AND THIS IS AN AS PROPOSED -- GOING FORWARD, COUNCILMEMBERS, FUTURE COUNCILMEMBERS AND COMMUNITY SHOULD TREAT THAT DISTINCTION SERIOUSLY. SO THANK YOU.
01:50:21.285: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
01:50:22.186: >> Councilmember Griswold: ANOTHER MEASURE OF THE LEGITIMACY OF THIS PRODUCT FOR TREATMENT IS THAT BLOOMBERG NEWS REPORTS THAT A UK COMPANY HAD PATENTED A SYNTHETIC VERSION OF WHAT THEY ARE CALLING THE MAGIC MUSHROOMS FOR USE IN TREATMENT RESISTANT DEPRESSION. IT STARTED TRADING ON NASDAQ LAST FRIDAY AND THE SHARES JUMPED 71% IN ONE DAY. SO I THINK THAT SHOWS THAT THERE IS SERIOUS CONSIDERATION FOR THIS PRODUCT AND COMPETENCE THAT IT'S GOING TO BE ANXCELLENT TREATMENT. TREATMENT PRODUCT.
01:51:08.966: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:51:09.533: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, MAYOR. APPRECIATE THE COURAGE, COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER SHOWS IN BRINGING THIS TO THE COUNCIL. WE HAVE BEENOBBIED BY THE LOCAL CHAPTER TO ADOPT A RESOLUTION ASKING FOR JUST THIS, AND SO I, AGAIN, WANTED TO ACKNOWLEDGE COUNCILMEMBERS FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING IT TONIGHT FOR ALL THE REASONS THAT HAVE BEEN STED. AND IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT THAT'S HOW DRUG POLICIES WORK IN AMERICA. IT'S WHAT MAKES MORE MONEY, CRIMINALIZING IT OR, YOU KNOW, ADVANCING THE MEDICAL BENEFITS OF THEM, WHETHER IT'S THIS OR MARIJUANA, WE SEE A SHIFT IN ERICAN POLICY. THERE WAS MUCH MORE MONEY TO BE MADE WITH CRIMINALIZATION OF THESE DRUGS AND NOW THIS IS A REALIZATION OF THE PROFIT TO BE MADE, AND SO IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF PEOPLE CAUGHT IN THE CROSS FIRE AND SERVING TIME AND HAVE HAD THEIR VES RUINED IN THE PROCESS OF THE SAUSAGE BEING MADE BUT, AGAIN, I JUST APPRECIATE THIS BEING BROUGHT UP AND I WILL BE SMARTING IT TONIGHT -- I WILL BE SUPPORTING IT TONIGHT.
01:52:48.399: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
01:52:49.400: >> Councilmember Eaton: THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THE SPONSS BRINGING THIS FORWARD. AND I APPRECIATE THE MEMBERS THE COMMUNITY WHO HAVE PROVIDED US WITH CONSIDERABLE LITERATURE ON THIS TOPIC. BUT I WANT TO MAKE CLEAR THERE THAT THERE'S CLINICAL AND RELIGIOUS USES THAT ARE BENEFICIAL AND THAT -- IT'S APPROPRIATE TO CRIMINALIZE THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR. WHAT THIS RESOLUTION DOES IS IT DIRECTS OUR POLICE DEPARTMENT TO DEEMPHASIZE THE ENFORCEMENT OF THESE LAWS. MUCH LIKE WE DID IN THE '70s, WITH REGARD TO MARIJUANA WHEN WE PASSED A $5 FINE FROM MARIJUANA. WE WERE DIRECTING OUR POLICE FORCE TO DO OTHER THINGS THAN PETTY DRUG BUSTS. MUCH LIK WHEN WE PASSED OUR IMMIGRANT STATUS ORDINANCE, WE WERE DIRECTING OUR POLICE DEPARTMENT AWAY FROM A CERTAIN KIND OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. SOME THINGS THAT WE FIND MORE IMPORTANT IN OUR COMMUNITY. AND I BELIEVE THAT THIS RESOLUTION DOES SOMETHING VERY SIMILAR. IT DEPRIORITIZES THE KD OF ARRESTS SO THAT WE'RE NOT CRIMINALIZING PERSONAL BEHAVIOR OF THIS SORT. JUST AS AN ASIDE IN THE LATE '40ESS AND EARLY '50s, MY FATHER WORKED AT THE YPSILANTI HOSPITAL, AND THEY DID THE RECREATIONAL USE OF THESE DRUGS IN THE '60s WHICH ENDED ALL OF IT. INTERESTING RESEARCH THAT WAS BEING CONDUCTED THAT LONG AGO, THAT IS STARTING TO EMERGE AGAIN. I HOPE THAT THIS DOESN'T LEAD TO SUTANCES BUT RATHER IT OPENS UP THE CLINICAL AND RELIGIOUS USES THAT HAVE A FRAMEWORK FOR PEOPLE TO FOLLOW WHEN THEY DELVE INTO THESE EXPERIENCES. BUT I INTEND TO SUPPORT THIS THIS EVENING AND I'M GLAD TO SEE IT COME FORWARD.
01:55:01.899: >> Mayor Taylor: COCIEMR BANNISTE
01:55:02.800: >> Couilmember Bannier: YES, THANK YOU, MAYOR TAYLOR. I'M SO PROUD TO HAVE THE COUNCILMEMBERS ALL SO INTERESTED IN THIS AND I WANT TO INVITE ANYONE WHO WANTS TO COSPONSOR WITH US, YOU ARE WELCOME. AND ENCOURAGED TO DO SO. I WANT TO THANK CHUCK REAM FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ROLE ON THIS ALL YEAR LONG AND ALSO JULIA BARRON, THE DIRECTOR THE LOCAL DECRIMINALIZE NATURE BRANCH AND CHAPTER. I DON'T THINK WE EVER HAD SO MANY MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS COME FORWARD AND SPEAK. I APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S WORK IN THIS AREA. DRDIAN QUINN, I THOUGHT THOSE COMMENTS WERE REALLY USEFUL ABOUT ROOMS OF RACIALIZED TRAUMA, AND SOME OF THE RELIGIOUS USES OF THIS HAVE BEEN CRIMINALIZED OVER THE YEARS AND IT'S TT VERY USE OF IT THAT CAN HELP HEAL IN A GUIDED THERAPY HEAL SOME OF THESE RACIALIZED TRAUMAS AN WOUNDS. SO I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT IT, AND, YOU KNOW, IN ADDITION TO THE SPEAKERS, WE GOT LETTERS FROM VETERANS ASSOCIATIONS, NONPROFITS THATELPED VETERANS WITH THEIR TRAUMA AND THEIR SUICIDE RATES, THAT ARE URGING US TO DO THIS TONIGHT. AND OTHER LETTERS FROM END OF LIFE TRYING TO HELP WITH PEOPLE UNDERSTANDING THEIR DEATH AND DIE WITH DIGNITY AND WE HAVE PEOPLE FROM THE RESERVE. I THANK CHRIS KURTZ FOR HELPING PREPARE THOSE. SO THAT'S IT. I WOULD LIKE TO UNDERLINE, IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO COSPONSOR AND HELP ANN ARBOR BE A LEADER IN THIS MOVEMENT, PLEASE DO.
01:57:25.008: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
01:57:30.380: >> Councilmember Grand: I WOULD LIKE TO THANK MY CONSTITUENT CHARLES REAM FOR SPEAKING. HE'S A TOP PERSON. THIS IS NOT MAYBE MY HIGHEST PRIORITY, BUT IF IT COMES TO COUNCIL, I WILL STAND BEHIND IT. AND I WILL KEEP WITH MY WORD. AND I HAV WORKED WITH STUDENTS WHO HAVE HAD CHRONIC DEPRESSION THAT THEY JUST CAN, NO MATTER WHAT, THEY TRY TO DIG THEIR WAY OUT OF AND SAID TO ME THINGS THAT THEY DON'T EXPECT TO LIVE TILL TEN YEARS LATER. AND I THINK WE DO -- THAT CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO SEE A FUTURE AND THEY JUST TRIED EVERYTHING. AND IT DOESN'T FEEL GOOD TO B ON THETHER SIDE OF THATND FEEL HELPLESS AND THEN OBVIOUSLY, IT'S MUCH WORSE FOR THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES. SO I BELIEVE THAT ANYTHING WE CAN -- WE CAN DO TO HELP MOVE THIS KIND OF TREATMENT FORWARD IS WORTH -- IS WORTH PUTTING OUR NAMES BEHIND AND OUR SUPPORT BEHIND. SO I WILL BE HAPPY. AND TO THE ADVOCES THANK YOU FOR ALL OF YOUR SUPPORT OF THE UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE.
01:58:53.063: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:58:54.464: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I WILL TAKE MY COLLEAGUES OFFER AND COSPONSOR THIS RESOLUTION. THANK YOU FOR THAT OPPORTUNITY.
01:59:07.878: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
01:59:09.279: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WOULD LIKE TO BE LISTED AS A COSPONSOR. AND I JUST WANT TO REPEAT THE ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER IN INITIATING THIS VERY IMPORNT RESOLUTION. THANK YOU.
01:59:31.368: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] ALL OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. DC-3 RESOLUTION TO EXTEND RESOLUTION R-20-194, RESOLUTION TO APPROVE DOWNTOWN STREET CLOSURES FOR RESTAURANT AND RETAIL USE DURING THE TIME OF MANDATED PHYSICAL DISTANCING AN RESOLUTION R-TO-302 RESOLUTION TO EXTEND RESOLUTION R-20-194, RESOLUTION TO APPROVE DOWNTOWN STREET CLOSURES FOR RESTAURANT AND RETAIL USE DURING THE TIME OF MANDATED PHYSICAL DISTANCING. IT ROLLS OFF THE TONGUE. MOVED BY HAYNER, SECONDED BY LUMM. DISCUSSION OF DC-3. ALL IN FAVOR? I'M SORRY, COUNCILMEMBER LUMM? YOU'RE ON MUTE.
02:00:25.522: >> Councilmember Lumm: I WAS GOING TO DEFER TO COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI. JUST A COUPLE OF QUICK COMMENTS. I'M HAPPY TO BE A COSPONSOR WITH COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI WHAT THIS DOES AGAIN -- AND WE HAVE HEARD FROM A LOT OF DOWNTOWN BUSINESSES REQUESTING OUR SUPPORT THIS HAS BEEN -- AS WE ALL UNDERSTAND, CRITICAL FOR THEIR SURVIVAL IN MY WAYS AND WHAT THIS DOES IS IT EXTENDSTENS EXISTING STREET CLOSURES THAT HAVE BEEN IN MAC PLACE IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT OF SOCIAL DISTANCING. COUNCIL APPROVED THESE ON JUNE 1st AT THE REQUEST OF THE DOWNTOWN MERCHANT ASSOCIATIONS. AND COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI AND I HAVE BN BEFORE AND SINCE BEEN MEETING WITH THE DOWNTOWN MERCHANT ASSOCIATIONS AND I APPRECIATE HIS LEADERSHIP ON THISSOR TH --ON THESE CLOSURES R CONCERNS BROUGHT TO US BY THE DOWNTOWN BUSINESSES. WERE THE CLOSURES WERE TO END AUGUST 23rd OR WHEN THE RESTRICTIONS ON GATHERING WERE STED BY GOVERNOR WHITR AND ON AUGUST 6th WE EXTENDED THE CLOSURE FOR 30 DAYS UNTIL SEPTEMBER 21st AND THEN THIS -- SO THIS RESOLUTION EXTENDS THE CLOSURES FOR ANOTHER MONTH OR SO UNTIL NOVEMBER 1st E RESTRICTIONS ON GATHERS IS LIFTED BY THE GOPOR. GOVERNOR.IT COVERS THE SAME DOWN STREETS. THE MERCHANT ASSOCIATIONS HAVE ASKED FOR THE EXTENDS AND WE MOVED SEVERAL EMAILS. THE PANDEMIC, NO QUESTION, HAS SEVERELY IMPACTED OUR LOCAL BUSINESSES. WE I APPRECIATE THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN AND SHOULD DO TO SUPPORT THEM AND HELPF A FACILITATE THEIR RECOVERY. AND THE WEATHER IS GETTING COOLER, BUT THERE WILL BE CONSIDERATION OF POTENTIAL FURTHER EXTENSION AND I APPRECIATE COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI'S LEADERSHIP ON THESE PROPOSAL THANK YOU.
02:02:40.790: >> Councmember Ramwi: THAN YOU, COUNCILMEMBER LUMM. I WAS WAITING FOR YOU TO TAKE THE LEAD. I HAD A GREAT EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH YOU AND TOM CRAWFORD AND OTHERS AND THE DDA AND MERCHANT ASSOCIATIONS WORKING TOGETHER AND MAKING ADJUSTMENTS AND THE ONLY ADJUSTMENTS WE NEEDED TO MAKE IS JUST EXTEND THEM. THEY HAVE HAVE BEEN A SMASHING SUCCESS IN A DARK TIME FOR MERCHANTS AND RESTAURANTERS. BUT WE APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT THAT COUNCILS HAVE GIVEN TO THIS PROGRAM AND OBVIOUSLY A VERY FAMILIAR RESOLUTION. AND THEOOPERATION AMONGST ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS HAS BEEN EXTRAORDINARY. EVERYBODY HAS BEEN COOPERATING TO THE FULLEST EXTENT IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THIS. ONCE AGAIN, SINCERE THANKS TO MY COLLEAGUES FROM MY OTHER COLLEAGUES. SO THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY. APPRECIATE IT.
02:03:50.226: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] ALL OPPOSED? WE'LL TAKE A SHORT BREAK. I'M SORRY LET'S RETURN AT 9:15. 9:15. THANK YOU. [ BREAK ]
02:14:01.803: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU EVERYONE, WE ARE BACK OF A AUTHORITY BREAK. DC-4, RESOLUTION TO PART WE ARE WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN TO PROVIDE EMERGENCY SHELTER IN ANN ARBOR. MOVED BY HAYNER AND SECONDED BY NELSON. COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
02:14:18.754: >> Councilmember Nelson: I ASKED JACKIE TO SEND OUT A SUBSTITUTE VERSION OF THIS RESOLUTION. I NEED TO THANK TERESA GIGLIOTTI FOR TALKING WITH ME ABOUT THIS RESOLUTION OVER THE LAST WEEK OR SO. SHE HELPED ME WITH SOME SMALL EDITS MAKE IT MORE CLEAR. THE SUBSTANCE HAS NOT CHANGED VERY MUCH. IT'S TWEAKING OF PHRASING IN THE WHEREAS [ APPLAUSE ] CLAUSES BASICALLY. THE CRUX OF THIS RESOLUTION IS A START OF A CONVERSATION. A CONVERSATION WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AND OUR LOCAL PARTNERS WHO PLAN FOR AND PROVIDE SERVICES FOR EMERGENCY SHELTER IN OUR COMMUNITY. I HOPE THIS WILL BE UNDERSTOOD AS A REASONABLE STEPO TAKE AND THERE A A FEW REASONS WHY I WANT TO START THIS CONVERSATION NOW. THIS PAST MARCH, I DON'T BELIEVE THAT ANY OF US WERE VERY PREPARED FOR THE CHALLENGES OF ISOLATION AND ESPECIALLY WHAT ISOLATION WITH BE LIKE FOR THOSE WITH HOUSING INEFFICIENCY. AT CITY HALL, W WERE TALKING ABOUT THE VALUE OF PEOPLE CAMPING OUTSIDE IN WHATEVER SPACE THEY COULD FIND BECAUSE THIS WAS AT LEAST A MAINTAINING DISTANCE FROM OTHER PEOPLE. THE COUNTY AND ITS PARTNERS HAVE WORKED HARD TO PROBLEM SOLVE DURING THIS PANDEMIC. THANKSTO THEIR EFFORTS AND FUNDING FROM THIS CITY COUNCIL, PEOPLE ARE IN SHELTER AT A LOCAL HOTEL. THESE LAST FEW WEEKSANY RESIDENTS IN OUR COMMUNITY ARE TALKING ABOUT RISKS RELATED TO COVID-19 AND SPECIFICALLY THE POSSIBLE A RESURGENCE. MY RESOLUTION ASKS FOR A MEETING WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AND THE LOCAL PARTNERS TO DISCUSS HOW WE MIGHT DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY IF IT HAPPENS AGAIN. IF WE HAVEUTBREAKHIS FL OR WINTER SEASON, I WOULD LIKE TO DISCUSS MORE THAN ENCAMPMENTS AND HOTELS. THOUSANDS OF UNITS OF HOUSING SET EMPTY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN THIS PAST SPRING AND SUMMER. THE WASTEFULNESS OF THAT SHOULD NOT BE REPEATED. THIS PAST SPRING AND SUMMER, OTHER COMMUNITIES FOUND A WAY TO PARTNER WITH LOCAL UNIVERSITIES TO MAKE USE OF EMPTY HOUSING -- EMPTY CAMPUSOUSING SO THAT PEOPLE COULD BE SHELTERED. THIS WEEK I TALKED TO SOME OF THE LEADERS WHO HELPED MAKE IT HAPPEN. AT SONOMA STATE UNIVERSITY IN THE BAY AREA OF CALIFORNIA, LOCAL LEADERS HELPED IDENTIFY THREE POTENTIAL PURPOSES FOR SPACE, TWO OF WHICH ENDED UP BEING NEEDED. THE COUNTY PARTNERED WITH SOW SONOMASTATE UNIVERSITIES WITH CC CONDITIONS AN OTHER VULNERABLE POPULATIONS SUCH AS THE HOMELESS. IT LASTED FROM APRIL TO AUGUST. LIKEWISE, IN BOSTON, LOCAL LEADERS ARRANGED FOR A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND SUFFOLK UNIVERSITY TO MAKE USE OF THE CAMPUS DORM FOR SHELTER. THEY HAD AN AGREEMENT THAT RAN IN APRIL AND RAN THROUGH THE MONTH OF AUGUST. IT PROVIDED HOUSING FOR 250 PEOPLE. BOTH OF THESE CAMPUS COMMUNITIES WERE ABLE TO MAKE ARRANGEMENTS IN A MATTER OF WEEKS SO CAMPUS HOUSING WAS REPURPOSED RELATIVELY EARLY AND FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME OVER FOUR MONTHS. THIS PAST WEEK, IN OUR QUESTIONS TO THE AGENDA, COUNCILMEMBER LUMM ASKED HOW LONG IT MIGHT TAKE TO ARRANGE SOMETHING SIMILARLY LOCALLY WITH UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN. THE ANSWER WAS IT MAY TAKE MORE THAN TWO OR THREE MONTHS. IF IT'S TRUE THAT PLANNING WOULD TAKE THAT MUCH TIME, IT'S EVEN MORE IMPORTANT THAT WE MEET RIGHT AWAY, AND DISCUSS THIS POSSIBILITY NOW RATHER THAN WAIT UNTIL A CRISIS MIGHT HAPPEN. I WANT TO THANK POLICE CHIEF COX FOR HELPING CONNECT ME WITH THE DIRECTOR OF THE BOSTON PUBLIC HETH DEPARTMENT, JERRY THOMAS. WHEN I TALKED TO MS. THOMAS I HAD ALREADY SEEN OUR AGENDA QUESTION ANSWERS AND I WAS ABLE TO SHARE THE TIMELINE OF MORE THAN TWO OR THREE MONTHS. MS. THOMAS EMPHASIZED AND REPEATED TO ME, THAT AN ARRANGEMENT WAS A MATTER OF POLITICAL WILL. I BELIEVE THAT ANN ARBOR AND THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN DO HA THEOLICAL WIL TO SEE PEOPLE HOUSED PARTICULARLY IF WE FIND OURSELVES IN A SITUATION WHERE HOUSING IS AVAILABLE AND EMPTY. MY RESOLUTION ASKS ONLY THAT WE MEET WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN BEFORE NOVEMBER 1st, AND TALK ABOUT IT. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT H W MIGHT PARTNER SPECIFICALLY IF THIS E ENDS IN PERSON AT THE UNIVERSITY AND IF CAMPUS HOUSING IS VACATED FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME. WE HAVE SEEN AT A NATIONAL LEVEL WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THERE IS A LACK OF LONG-TERM PLANNING. LOCALLY, I THINK WE CAN DO BETTER. I URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION. IT REALLY IS JUST AN ASKOR A ETING AND A PUBLIC CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS. THIS' A LOT OF WHAT IFS ATTACHED TO IT, BUT MOSTLY THE RESOLUTION IS ABOUT A MEETING.
02:19:25.628: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER. I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO GET THIS GOING.
02:19:32.101: >> Councilmember Hayner: AFTER THE SPRING/SUMMER WHEN THEY CANCELED THE END OF LAST YEAR AND WENT OFF CAMPUS, I COULDN'T DRIVE BY THE HILL DORMS WITHOUT SEEING ALL THE EMPTY WINDOWS WHEN THE SPORTS CAMPS WERE CANCELED AND THINKING IF ONLY. AS A FORMER RA, I WAS UP ON BURRSLY, AND YOU GET A SENSE OF WHAT IT'S LIKE, NOW THAT YOU HAVE LIVED IN A DORM SITUATION ON A HOUSING STAFF, OR A RESIDENTIAL STAFF. THE FACILITIES HAVE NOT CHANGED THAT DRAMATICALLY, IT'S NOT DIFFICULT TO CONFIGURE SPACE IN OFF TO ALLOW PART OF IT OFF FOR THE NEEDS THE COMMUNITY IF IT'S AVAILABLE. IT'S NOT DIFFICULT TO SEGMENT OFF WINGS OF THESE BUILDINGS AND STAREWELLS AND ELEVATORS AND SO ON AND MAKE IT TO BE ABLE TO BE USED SAFELY BY -- OR LOANED, YOU MIGHT SAY TO OTHER NEEDS IN THE COMMUNITY IF IT'S SITTING EMPTY. AND BOSTON'S WORK OUT THERE, PROBABLY FALLS UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THEIR PILOT PROGRAM WHICH ENCOMPASSES ALL OF THE NONPROFITS IN THE CITY, INCLUDING THE 47 MAJOR CULTURAL AND EDUCATIONAL AND MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS:  AND SO TO HOUSE 250 PEOPLE UNDER THIS THAT PROGRAM AND WRITE IT OFF TO THE PILOT PROGRAM WITHOUT CHARGING THE CITY OR THE COMMUNITY IS EXCELLENT OF THEM TO DO THAT, AND REALLY, REALLY, THEY REALLY STEPPED UP WHEN THEY DID THAT WITH BOSTON. AND THAT RELATIONSHIP THAT BOSTON HAS HAD WITH THESE COMMUNITIES BECAUSE OF THIS PILOT PROGRAM, I THINK SHOWS THE VALUE IN A PO PILOT PROGRAM ANDI CONVERSATION AFTER THIS RESOLUTI PASSES. BECAUSE IT'S COUNTYWIDE SOLUTIONS THAT WE CAN AND I SEE MS. GIGLIOTTI IS HERE. HOPEFULLY OUR CONVERSATION CAN HELP TO INFORM CONVERSATIONS THAT MAY BE HAD WITH OTHER INSTITUTIONS WHO HAVE HOUSING IN EASTERN, I KNOW EASTERN HAS SOLD SOME OF THE LARGE BUILDINGS OFF. I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS AND MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS AND, YOU KNOW, THERE'S NOTHING -- JUST LIKE WHEN WE SEE IN SEATTLE, THEY WOULD HAVE EMPTY APARTMENTS AND PEOPLE SLEEPING IN THE DOORWAYS AND THERE'S NOTHING SADDER THAN UNUSED HOUSING IN A TIME OF NEED. AND SO THE POTENTIAL THAT WE COULD START THIS CONVERSATION WITH UNIVERSITY ON TOP OF CONTINUING TO BE PREPARED AND PURSUE OUR NEEDS AND OTHER HOUSING VENUES OR AREAS, INCLUDING HAVING TO REPRESENT R, I THINK IT'S PERFECTLY IMPORTANT THAT WE DO IT AND I URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO SUPPORT THIS. THANK YOU.
02:22:19.702: >> May Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
02:22:22.071: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANKS TO COUNCILMEMBER NELSON FOR STIMULATING THIS CONVERSATION HERE TONIGHT, AND GETTING US TO TALK ABOUT THINGS BEFORE THEY HAPPEN, SO WE ARE NOT REACTIONARY AND WE ACTUALLY PERHAPS AT TIMES HAVE PLANS IN PLACE TO TAKE CARE OF THESE THINGS. I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS, THOUGH. THIS DOES CALL OUT FOR TIME FRAMES THAT ARE AGGRESSIVE, NOVEMBER 1st, TO HAVE A MEETING BETWEEN THE CITY COUNCIL AND THE REGENTS TO DISCUSS THE HOUSING NEEDS BOTH TEMPORARY AND LONG TERM, AND S THE INTENT, I APPRECIATE THE SPIRIT THAT THIS CONVERSATION, AND THIS RESOLUTION IS BEING BROUGHT UNDER, THE RESOLVE CLAUSES SEEM TO HAVE A GREATER PURPOSE TO THEM, AND MAYBE I'M -- I'M READING INTO IT INCORRECTLY, BUT IT SEEMS RATHER BROADERND MORE OF A SYSTEMIC ISSUES THAT WE HAVE WITH AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND HOUSING IN GENERAL THAT WE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING ON COUNCIL FOR QUITE SOMETIME. SO IS THIS MORE FOR ABOUT COVID-19 ISSUES? THE ISSUES THAT ARISE FROM COVID-19? OR IS IT MORE ABOUT OUR HOUSING IN GENAL? AND WHETHER OUR CITY ADMINISTRATOR BELIEVES IF I CAN ASK MR. CRAWFORD THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO SET UP A MEETING IN TIME AND IT -- WOULD THE UNIVERSITY BE INTERESTED IN EVEN HAVING THAT CONVERSATION WITH US? I DON'T LIKE TO -- I WOULD WANT A PARTNER IN THE CONVERSATION THAT -- THAT SHOWS INTEREST IN HAVING THAT CONVERSATION, AND NOT BE UNILATERAL WITH THAT REQUEST. SO DOES -- AGAIN, IS NOVEMBER 1st BACK TO THAT -- IS THAT TOO SOON TO HAVE THIS? IS IT POSSIBLE TO DISCUSS WHAT IS BEING ASKED IN THESE RESOLVE CLAUSES BY THAT DEADLINE?
02:24:33.101: >> I CAN CERTAINLY ASK ABOUT A MEETING, BUT I DON'T KNOW -- I ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW THE BOARD'S SCHEDULE AND THEY JUST HAD A MEETING LAST WEEK. SO YOUR POINTS ABOUT SOME OF THE QUESTIONS BEING SYSTEMIC VERSUS RELEVANT ONE PARTICULARLYN THE AMOUNT OF MATERIALS OR THOUGHTS WE MIGHT WANT TO PREPARE GOING INTO THAT CONVERSATION, AND NOVEMBER 1st R THAT -- TO SCHEDULE A MEETING MAY BE ONE THING. TO HAVE A MEETING WOULD BE ANOTHER. BUT I ACTUALLY DO NOT KNOW WHETHER I COULD EVEN GET IT SCHEDULED BY NOVEMBER. I HAVE REAED OUT, BUT IT WAS JUST TODAY. SO I HAVEN'T HAD TIME TO COLLECT THE INFORMATION.
02:25:22.951: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: COULD WE SUBSTITUTE THE LANGUAGE. I DON'T KNOW IF THE SPONSOR OF THIS RESOLUTION WOULD BE AMENABLE TO CHANGING SO IT'S UNDER LIKE A REASONABLE TIME FRAME OR AS SOON AS REASONABLY POSSIBLE OR SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT SO WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE FLEXIBILITY IN ARRANGING THAT MEETING IF WE CHOOSE TO DO SO? OR ARE YOU PRETTY --
02:25:45.607: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I MEAN COULD WE -- COULD WE PHRASE IT IDEALLY BEFORE NOVEMB NOVEMBER 1st. I MEAN, I APPRECIATE THAT THIS IS AN ATTEMPT. I MEAN THE THING IS -- SO I GUESS WOULD SAY TO YOUR POINT, COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, WHEN WE HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT MAKING AN ASK OF THE UNIVERSITY, WHETHER IT'S A SPECIFIC ASK AND NOW THE ONLY ASK IS A MEETING, I'M REALLY QUITE ASTONISHED AT THE MES PESSIMISM OF THEY WOULDT EV MEET WITH US. REALLY? I MEAN, I -- IS THAT REALLY HOW IT WORKS? I GUESS I'M ASTONISHED BY THAT IDEA. I APPRECIATE THE CONCERN ABOUT A TIMELINE BEING TOO QUICK, BUT IT ACTUALLY HAS BEEN SUGGESTED TO ME THAT THEY WOULD NOT EVEN MEET WITH US, WHICH I JUST FIND STUNNING. BECAUSE QUITE A LOT OF THE TIME, THE MEETING BEGINS UNILATERALLY IN TERMS OF ONE PARTY REQUESTING IT. I DON'T KNOW HOW OFTEN TWO PEOPLE SIMULTANEOUSLY REQUEST A MEETING AT THE SAME TIME. TYPICALLY ONE PERSON INITIATES IT. SO I GUESS --
02:26:59.514: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  WE STILL HAVEN'T MET WITH THEM ONCE AND I HAVE BEEN ON COUNCIL FOR ALMOST TWO YEARS.
02:27:04.386: >> Councilmember Nelson: WELL, WE WOULD HAVE HAD A MEETING THIS PAST SPRING, EXCEPT FOR COVID, AND THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN SOCIALLY.
02:27:10.325: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  YOU KNOW, WHY HASN'T IT DONE, YOU KNOW, ELECTRONICALLY SINCE THEN. WE HAVE HAD MEETING ELECTRONICALLY AND THEY HAVE HAD ELECTRONICALLY. WE HAVEN'T HAD THAT INFAMOUS MEETING. IT'S BEEN TWO YEARS.
02:27:23.305: >> Councilmember Nelson:  IS THAT NOT A REASON TO ACTUALLY MOVEORWARD AND TRY TO HAVE ONE? THAT'S A REASON TO NOT HAVE ONE?
02:27:28.810: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I'M NOT SAYING, IT'S NOT BUT YOU ARE ASKING ABOUT THE PESSIMISM AND WHY I'M FEELING PESSIMISTIC. WE STILL HAVE YET TO MEET WITH THEM.
02:27:43.058: >> Councilmember Nelson: THAT'S TRUE.
02:27:45.761: >>ayor Taylor:OUNCILMEMBER
02:27:47.596: >> Councilmember Grand: TO PIGGYBACK ON COUNCILMAN RAMLAWI'S POINT, THE SECOND RESOLVE [ APPLAUSE ] , THE ONLY WAY AROUND IT IS TO REMOVE IT, BECAUSE WE DON'T NEED AS A COUNCIL MEET WITH THE REGENTS TO HAVE THIS ISSUE GO FORWARD. I THINK THIS WOULD BE MUCH MORE APPROPRIATE TO HAVE STAFF AT THE COUNTY H, HAVE OUR CITY STAFF TK TO THE PEOPLE WHO CAN ACTUALLY -- WHO ACTUALLY KNOW IF THIS CAN HOUSING AND PROBABLY HOUSING STAFF AT THE UNIVERSITY, MORE THAN THE REGENTS. I DON'T THINK THE REGENTS COULD GIVE YOU DETAILS ABOUT HOUSING AND AS SOMEONE WHO REGULARLY HOLDS ZOOM MEETING WITH STUDENTS SITTING IN DORM ROOMS EVERY DAY, I -- THIS IS I ACCOMPLI INDICATED ISSUE. THE ISSUE THAT I ALSO HAVE WITH THIS RESOLUTION IS I THINK IT DOESN'T -- I APPRECIATE INITIATING THE CONVERSATION, IT DOESN'T ACKNOWLEDGE THE WORK THAT OUR STAFF IN THE HOUSING COMMISSION AND THE COUNTY HAVE ALREADY BEEN DOING WITH THE UNIVERSITY. I KNOW THAT THERE ARE -- AND I WANT TO ASK MS. DOYLE, I WILL PUT YOU ON THE SPOT, BUT DURING -- WHEN WE WERE THINKING ABOUT THINGS LIKE FIELD HOSPITALS AND QUARANTINING, WASN'T THE HOUSING COMMISSION AND COUNTY IN TO. COUNTY IN TALKS WITH THEUNIVERSG FORHAT PURPOSE?
02:29:15.617: >> YES, THEOUNTY LEADERSHIP WAS IN TOUCH WITH U OF M, CONCORDIA AND EASTERN AT DIFFERENT POINTS TO TALK ABOUT A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT SCENARIOS. THINGS WERE CHANGES A LOT. SOME CONVERSATIONS WERE QUARANTINE. SOME CONVERSATIONS WERE ABOUT POTENTIAL USE EVER DORMS FOR SHELTER. NONE OF THOSE ULTIMATELY PANNED OUT THIS SPRING/SUMMER, BUT WE
02:29:33.935: >> Councmember Grand: THANK YOU. I THINK THERE'S A FOUNDATION FOR THIS KIND OF CONVERSATION ALREADY. AND IT -- IT WAS A LITTLE DISCONCERNING TO ME THAT IT DOESN'T ACKNOWLEDGE THE WORK THAT WAS ALREADY HAPPENING. I'M GLAD YOU WERE ABLE TO CIRCLE BACK WITH MS. GIGLIOTTI AND GET SOME CLARIFICATION ON THAT. I THINK THERE HAVE BEEN CONVERSATIONS ALREADY. COMFORTAE ASKING MR. CRAWFORDRY AND MS. GIGLIOTTI AND PERHAP MS. HALL AND OTHERS TO WORK WITH THE UNIVERSITY, BUT I DON'T THINK THAT WILL HAPPEN WITH US SITTING DOWN AND US DEMANDING THE REGENTS THAT THEY MEET WITH US TO TALK ABOUT THIS ONE PARTICULAR ISSUE. I JUST I DON'T THINK IT'S REFLECTIVE OF THE CURRENT SITUATION WITH HOUSING, WHICH IS SCHEDULED TO HAVE STUDENTS IN HOUSING UNTIL THANKSGIVING, WITH A SHORT BREAK AND THEN COMING BACK AND THAT COULD DEFINITELY CHANGE. BUT THE UNIVERSITY IS BEING FAIRLY DELIBERATE IN HOW THEY ARE KEEPING HOUSING DENSITIES LOW. SO TO HELP TRY TRY TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF COVID. SO I DO -- IF THERE'S HOUSING THAT BECOMES AVAILABLE, I SHARE THE SAME SENTIMENT THAT MY COLLEAGUES HAVE EXPRESSED ABOUT SEEING EMPTY DORMS AND WISHING WE COULD USE THEM FOR OTHER PURPOSES FOR THOSE WHO NEED HOUSING IN THE COMMUNITY I THI THE APPROACH MISSES THE MARK.
02:31:07.329: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
02:31:10.098: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WILL BE SHOCKED IF I WAS NEXT.
02:31:20.942: >> Mayor Taylor: YOU ARE IN THE QUEUE.
02:31:25.347: >> Councmember Hayne THAN YOU. I HAVE NEVER -- IT HAS NOT BEEN MY EXPERIENCE TO KNOW THAT MS. GIGLIOTTI OR MS. HALL OR ANYONE WHO IS WORKING DILIGENTLY TO MEET THE CHALLENGES OF THOSE WHO ARE HOUSING CHALLENGED HAVEN'T -- YOU KNOW, HAVE THEY LEFT NO STONE UNTURD, I'M SURE. THE DIFFERENCE HERE IS THAT IN THOSE MEETINGS THERE HAS NOT BEEN A SEAT AT THE TABLE FOR THE POLICYMAKERS. AND THAT'S WHAT WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING. WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE SETTING POLICY AROUND HOUSING AND ADDING OUR KEEN EYE TO TH OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE IN OUR COMMUNITY AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE THIS COMES IN AND PERHAPS THE REGENTS, BUT PERHAPS SOME OF THEM WANT TO BE AT THAT TABLE AND PERHAPS SOME OF US WANT TO BE AT THE TABLE WHEN THOSE CONVERSATIONS ARE HAD SO WE CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT THE CONVERSATION IS AND WE CAN FORM BETTER POLICY. I SEE THIS AS AN EORT TO REINVOLVE POLICYMAKERS IN THESE DECISIONS AND INFORM US IN WHAT IS GOING ON AND HOW CAN WE CRAFT POLICY FOR OTHER -- OTHER NOTIONS WITH OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO GET BETTER OUTCOMES AND SO I FULLY SUPPORT THIS TO GIVE POLICYMAKERS A SEAT AT THAT CONVERSATION TABLE, AND TO MAKE SUREHAT CONVERSATION IS HAD AGAIN. AND LAST THING I WILL SAY IS A GENERAL STATEMENT TO REMIND EVERYBODY THAT IT'S A STATE UNIVERSITY THAT THE -- SHOCKING AS IT MAY BE FOR PEOPLE TO HEAR THIS, THAT THE LAND AND THE BUILDINGS BELONG TO THE STATE AND THEREFORE THEY BELONG TO ALL OF US. WE ARE WELL WITHIN OUR RIGHTS TO ASK FOR A CONVERSATION ABOUT THE USE AND THE ONGOING USE, ALTERNATIVE USES OR WHATEVER ELSE FOR THIS PUBLIC LAND THAT EXISTS HERE IN OUR COMMUNITY. IINTEGRATED AS IT MAY BE IN OUR COMMUNITY, IT IS STILL PUBLIC LAND AND A PUBLIC UNIVERSITY. I THINK THIS IS PERFECTLY APPROPRIATE AND I HOPEHAT WE N MOVE THIS FORWARD.
02:33:42.150: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
02:33:43.485: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I AGREE WITH COUNCILMEMBER GRAND. IN TERMS OF WHERE THE WORK IS BEING DONE AND I THINK THE -- UNLIKE CITY COUNCIL, THE U OF M REGENTS TEND TO APPROVE THE WORK OF STAFF AND THEY DON'T GET INVOLVED IN THE DETAILED. THAT BEING SAID, I THINK THAT MAYBE THIS RESOLUTION COULD BE DIVIDED INTO TWO ACTION ITEMS. ONE WOULD BE FOR THE APPROPRIATE STAFF AND INTERESTED COUNCIEMBERS TO MEET WITH REPRESENTATIVES FROM UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AND MAYBE WE DON'T SPECIFY WHO THOSE REPRESENTATIVES ARE TO ADDRESS COVID-RELATED HOUSING ISSUES AND WE ASK STAFF TO MEET WITH REGENTS OF UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AND CITY COUNCIL TOASTITODISCUSS HOUSING AS WELLR TOPICS. I THINK IT'S REASONABLE TO MEET WITH REGENTS ONCE A YEAR TO DISCUSS POLICY ISSUES. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT SEEMS LIKE AN ACCEPTABLE COMPROMISE.
02:35:09.904: >> MAY I MAKE A COMMENT? I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE MEETINGS WITH STAFF TO STAFF, AND NOT HAVE COUNCILMEMBERS IN THAT DISCUSSION. YOU MAY -- BUILDINGS ON WHAT YOU SAID, COUNCILWOMAN GRISWOLD. IF YOU DON'T PURSUE A MEET, YOU MAY CONSIDERAVING US POLICYMAKERS LOBBY THEIR POLICYMAKERS. EITHER A MEETING OR A LOBBY BUT I THINK STAFF DISCUSSIONS NEED TO BE WITHOUT COUNCILMEMBERS THERE FOR US TO GET OUR WORK DONE IN A MANNER THAT WE NORMALLY WORK.
02:35:44.706: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WOULD LIKE TO CHALLENGE THAT IN TERMS OF WHAT HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED TO DATE WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN. AND MAYBE I'M JUST UNAWARE OF THAT, AND I'M FIND HAVING POLICYMAKERS ADVOCATE AND LET STAFF BEGIN THIS DISCUSSION. I DON'T SEE A LOT OF SUCCESS HISTORICALLY.
02:36:16.905: >> WE COVID, WE HAD ENGAGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS. THE CITY WAS NOT INVOLVED IN THE HOUSING DISCUSSION SINCE THE COUNTY HAS BEEN THE LEAD ON THAT,UT.
02:36:31.286: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I DIDN'T MEAN TO CRITICIZE THE COVID OPERATION. I THINK THAT WAS EXCELLENT. I WAS TALKING MORE ABOUT WORKING WITH THE UNIVERSITY SAY OVER THE LAST DECADE AND GETTING ANY FINANCIAL SUPPORT. A PILOT. THEY SEEM PRETTY SET IN THEIR WA. YES, THE COVID OPERATION WAS EXCELLENT.
02:37:01.516: >> Mayor Taylor: I WILL STEP IN BRIEFLY ON THIS. FOR ME, IT'S AN INTERESTING IDEA TRYING TO WORK WITH UNIVERSITY IN ORDER TO USE UNIVERSITY RESOURCES IN THE EVENT THOSE RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE. I'M TROUBLED, HOWEVER, BY THE -- BY THE APPROACH. YOU KNOW, PARTICULARLY FIRST FOUR RESOLVE CLAUSES, YOU KNOW, WE'RE DEALING WITH FOLKS WHO HAVE WORKED THEIR TAILS OFF TO TRY TO PUT TOGETHER A SEMESTER THAT IN THEIR VIEW MEETS PUBLIC HEALTH NEEDS AND MEETS THEIR INSTITUTIONAL NEEDS. THEY HAVE WORKED -- THE UNIVERSITY, THE PEOPLE TO WHOM WE ARE -- WITH WHOM WE ARE SEEKING TO ENGAGE, LEADERSHIP UP AND DOWN THE LINE HAVE WORKED VERY HARD ON THEIR -- ONHERE THEYRE TODAY, AND THEY HAVE PUT A LOT OF BLOOD AND SWEAT AND PERSONAL AND INSTITUTIONAL FACE AND ON THE LINE HERE. AND IN THESE RESOLVE CLAUSES, WE ARE SAYING THAT THEY HAVE INVITED STUDENTS TO COME AS AND IT'S A HIGH LIKELIHOOD OF FAILURE AND THEXPECTED RESURGENCE. I THINK WE IN THE COMMUNITY AND PERHAPS HERE AT THE TABLE, WE MAY FEEL THOSE THINGS, WE'RE TRYING TO WORK WITH HUMANS WHO RUN AN INSTITUTION AND IT STRIKES ME THAT THE -- ESSENTIALLY THIS RESOLUTION AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED, I WOULD LIK IF COUNCIL WOULD REMOVE THE FIRST FOUR RESOLVE CLAUSES. WE ARE SAYING --
02:38:47.488: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  ARE YOU REFERRING TO THE WHEREAS CLAUSES AND NOT THE RESOLVE CLAUSES?
02:38:52.560: >> Mayor Taylor: DID I SAY RESOLVE CLAUSES, I MEANT THE FIRST WHEREAS CLAUSES. THANK YOU.
02:38:57.465: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU
02:39:05.039: >> Mayor Taylor: WE ARE SAYING WHEN YOU HAVE THE EXPECTED PUBLIC FAIL SURE AT WHICH YOUR HOPES FOR A SEMESTER WILL BE DASHED, LET'S TALK AND DO THE COMMUNITY AAVOR.
02:39:26.227: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I WOULD ACCEPT THAT AS A FRIENDLY AMENDMENT.
02:39:32.333: >> Mayor Taylor: THAT'S MOVED AND SECONDED. IS THAT FRIENDLY TO THE BODY? THANK YOU. I GUESS I DON'T HAVE ANY FURTHER REJECTION TO THE RESOLUTION AS A WHOLE. I DON'T THINK THE SECOND RESOLVE CLAUSE IS LIKELY TO BE SUCCESSFUL. THE REGENTS SCHEDULE IS PACKED. UNIVERSITY DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY. WE DO. I THINK THIS IS AN INTERESTING IDEA THAT SHOULD RUN STAFF TO STAFF. I THINK WE SHOULD EXPECT THAT TO BE THE CASE. AND TRY TO -- TRY TOOISE THE RESOLUTION FOR SUCCESS, BUT I WON'T PRESS THAT POINT. COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
02:40:18.379: >> Councilmember Eaton: THANK YOU. THE IDEA OF COUNCIL AND REGENTS SITTING DOWN FOR A JOINT MEETING IS NOT A NEW IDEA. LAST YEAR AT ABOUT THIS POINT IN TIME, A COUPLE OF COUNCILMEMBERS KETHE PREVIOUS CITY ADMINISTRATOR TO JOIN A JOINT SESSION OF THE REGENTS AND THE COUNCIL. AT A FOOTBALL PREGAME EVENT, I RAN INTO HIGH RANKING UNIVERSITY STAFF WHO DON'T SPEAK LOOSELY, WHO INDICED SPORT FOR THE IDEA OF HAVING A JOINT SESSION OF THE REGIONS AND THE COUNCIL TO DISCUSS A VARIETY OF IDEAS AT THAT POINT IN TIME, THE IDEA WAS TO TALK ABOUT A PILOT AND TO TALK ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING. TIME HAS MOVED ON. THOSE ARRANGEMENTS WEREN'T MADE. THAT'S A SEPARATE PROBLEM ALL BY ITSELF. I THINK WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE UNIVERSITY IS NOT OUR ENTITY. THEY ARE A COMMUNITY MEMBER. THEY ARE COMMUNITY MINDED, MUCH MORE THAN THEY GET CREDIT FOR AND I BELIEVE THAT THEY WOULD ENGAGE US IN A DISCUSSION. AS TO WHETHER THERE IS AN AGREEMENT, THAT IS NOT REQUIRED BY THIS RESOLUTION. THE RESOLUTION ASKS FOR THE MEETING. I THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO HAVE POLICYMAKERS MEET WITH POLICYMAKERS TO DISCUSS POLICY. THAT IS JUST FUNDAMENTAL. STAFF FOR THE CITY OR THE UNIVERSITY REALLY CAN'T BE EMPORED T TAKE THESE ACTIONS UNLESS THE POLICYMAKERS SET THEM IN THAT DIRECTION. THE FACT THAT THERE'S DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN THE COUNTY STAFF AND THE UNIVERSITY STAFF THAT GOT NOTHING IS AN INDICATION OF WHY IT MAKES SO MUCH TENSE TO HAVE A MTING AT POLICY LEVEL. SO I SUPPORT THE RESOLUTION AS IT'S CURRENTLY RENT AND I WOULD OPPOSE TO DELEGATE THIS TO OUR STAFF TO ENGAGE THEIR STAFF. I THINK THE ONLY WAY WE HAVE A MEANINGFUL DISCUSSION ABOUT THE POTENTIAL USE OF STUDENT HOUSING FOR OUR HOUSING NEEDS IN THE COMMUNITY IS TO APPROACH IT POLICYMAKER TO POLICYMAKER AND NOT DELEGATE IT TO STAFF MEMBERS. THANK YOU. Mayor Taylo COUNCILMEMB LUMM?
02:43:04.545: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR AND COUNCILMEMBER NELSON FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. THERE'S NO DENYING THE CITY AND THE UNIVERSITY SHARE A RESPONSIBILITY IN TERMS OF THE HEALTH AND THE WELFARE OF ANN ARBOR AND THAT MOST CERTAINLY INCLUDES HOUSING BOTH NEAR TERM SHELTER HOUSING AND LONG-TERM PERMANENT HOUSING SUPPLY. SO WE ALL AGREE THAT THAT IS AN ISSUE THAT WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER ON AT THE PROFESSIONAL LEVEL BY OUR IS POINTED OFFICIALS AND BY OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS. THE RESOLUTION, ESSENTIALLY SAYS AS COUNCILMEMBER NELSON ARTICULATED THAT THE CITY AND THE UNIVERSITY NEED TO HAVE A SERIOUS DIALOGUE ABOUT HOUSING SHORT AND LONG TERM, I THINK MOST FOLKS WOULD AGREE THAT THAT IS APPROPRIATE. THE FOCUS OF RESOLUTION IS MORE ON THE SHORT TERM AND PROVIDING EMERGENCY SHELTER THIS WINTER. THAT'S CTAINLY ALSO A REAL NEED, ESPECIALLY WITH THE NECESSITY OF ADJUSTED LIVING CONDITIONS FOR SAFE SOCIAL DISTANCING. THE U OF M MEDICAL CENTER THIS PAST SPRING TOOK THE LEAD FOR THE DORMS FOR FIELD HOSPITAL USE. AND I TALKED TO SOMEOLKS INVOLVED WITH THAT, BUT THAT WAS DIFFERENT. THAT WAS FOR FIELD HOSPITAL USE. OBVIOUSLY THAT WAS NECESSARY AND I APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT THEY DID IN THAT REGARD. THE CITY STAFF DID INDICATE THAT IN INITIAL DISCUSSIONS U OF M IS NOT INTERESTED IN DOING THIS. IT REMINDS ME ABOUT DISCUSSIONS OF A PIL. LAST YEAR, FOR THE BUDGET RETREAT LAST YEAR, I MADE ONE REQUEST. WE WERE SOLICITED FOR OUR INPUT WE WOULD LIKE DISCUSSED. MY ONLY ASK WAS TO INCLUDE A THE UNIVERSITY AT OUR BUDGETTH RETREAT. AND THEN WHEN WE GOT THE AGENDA, IT WAS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND. IT WAS NOT EVEN LISTED. SO IT DOES TAKE POLITICAL WILL. I WON'T BE AROUND FOR PURSUING THAT. THAT NEEDS TO BE KEPT ON THE RADAR ASELL, AND STAFF DOES HAVE REGULAR MEETINGS WITH THE U OF M, BUT THEY ARE GENERALLY ABOUT VARIOUS CAPITAL PROJECTS, NOT THINGS LIKE -- NOT TOPICS LIKE THIS. I DO THINK THAT THIS GIVES THE INCENTIVE TO BE SERIOUS ABOUT. THIS AND I DO APPRECIATE THAT COUNCIL MEMBER NELSON WAS OKAY WITH REMOVING SOME OF THE WHEREAS CLAUSES ABOUT CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS. I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, WE ARE SOMEHOW GETTING HUNG UP ON THE DETAIL AND THE WHOLE POINT THAT COUNCILMCOUNCILMEMBER NELSON ISG TO MAKE, CONTACTING OTHER UNIVERSITY TOWNS AND COMMUNITIES, WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT THIS AND IF AS COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD SUGGESTED, IF THIS INVITATION BE EXNDED THOSE WHO ARE ENTERED, FINE. PUT BUT JUST HAVE THE CONVERSAT. THOSE ANNUAL MEETINGS THAT WE HAVE THE UNIVERSITY, THEY ARE SOCIAL GET-TOGETHERS. WE NEED TO DO MORE OF THIS SIT DOWN OR BY ZOOM MEETING WITH -- WITH OUR, YOU KNOW, COUNTERPARTS AT THE U OF M, AND WITH STAFF, VIOUSLY, ANDAVE A SERIOUS DIALOGUE ABOUT HOUSING. AND THIS, AGAIN, FOCUSES ON SHORT TERM, BUT WE ALSO NEED TO HAVE A DIALOGUE ABOUT LONG TERM HOUSING AND THINGS LIKE PILOTS AND, YOU KNOW -- AND THE INITIAL RESOLUTION THAT COUNCILMEMBER NELSON PRESENTED MADE A REFERENCE TO THE FIRE STATION ON NORTH CAMPUS. OVER THE YEARS I HAVE NAGGED AND NAGGED THE CITY STAFF ABOUT THE U OF M PROVIDING SOME FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR THAT FIRE STATION. THAT HASN'T HAPPENED. BUT, YOU KNOW, THOSE ARE THE KIND OF THINGS THAT WE CAN TALK ABOUT IN A MORE MEANINGFUL, PRODUCTIVE WAY, PERHAPS. AND SO I'M SUPPORTING THIS, AND I APPRECIATE THAT COUNCILMEMBER NELSON BROUGHT THIS FORWARD AND PERHAPS TO ADDRESS COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI'S SUGGESTION THAT IF THE TIMING IS TOO AGGRESSIVE AND MR. CRAW CRAWFORD, YOU SEEMED TO INDICATE THAT. MAYBE IN THE LAST TWO RESOLVE CLAUSES WHERE IT REFERENCES DO THIS BEFORE NOVEMBER 1st, JUS AD IF FEASIBLE, IF THAT WOULD BE FRIENDLY TO THE BODY, BUT I WILL LEAVE THAT TO COUNCILMEMBER NELSON IF SHE WANTS TO MAKE THAT CHANGE. THANK YOU.
02:48:22.329: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
02:48:23.998: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU, MAYOR TAYLOR. I DO WANT TO PROVIDE A CHANG TO TH FIRST RESOLVE CLAUSE. I JUST SENT JACKIE -- I HOPE SHE GOT IT -- A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WORDING TO FIRST RESOLVE CLAUSE AND THEN ALSO TO THE DATE OF -- A MEETING WITH THE REGIONS. -- REGENTS, I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO ESTABLISH THAT DATE NOW AND TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY, I GUESS TO DO, THA EVEN THOUGH WE ARE TALKING ON TWO SEPARATE ISSUES HERE. MOVING THAT DATE TO A CERTAIN DATE, YOU KNOW, MAYBE FEBRUARY 1st OR MARCH 1st. I WOULD LIKE TO GET SOMETHING IN MACE WHILE WE ARE ON THEOPIC. OUR HOUSING ISSUES AND GOALS HERE, WITH THE UNIVERSITY, SO IT'S DIFFERENT THINGS HERE, BUT FIRST ONE BEING THE FIRST RESOLVE CLAUSE, IF YOU RECEIVED IT BY NOW. THE FIRST -- AND I APOLOGIZE. THE TERM NEGOTIATE, THE FACT THAT WE WILL ENTER NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE UNIVERSITY GIVES ME A LITTLE BIT OF PAUSE. I WOULD RATHER HAVE IT MORE ABOUT THE DISCUSSION ABOUT THE POSSIBILITIES RATHER THAN ENTERING NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE UNIVERSITY. SO I APOLOGIZE, BUT I'M JUST ON THE FLY HERE PUTTING THAT TOGETHER, AND CHANGED SOME WORDING SOHE -- SO TT I READS THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR WILL IMMEDIATELY TAKE STEPS TO DISCUSS WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN THE POSSIBILITY OF USING AVAILABLE HOUSING UNITS AT THEIR ANN ARBOR CAMPUS IN ANTICIPATION AND THE REST IS THE SAME. BUT THE WORD "NEGOTIATE" GIVES ME A LITTLE BIT OF HEARTBURN.
02:50:18.645: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE A SECOND? SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER SMITH. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, YOU STILL HAVE THE FLOOR. SO THAT'S IT FOR THIS PART OF IT ON THIS FIRST AMENDMENT, IF IT'S GOING TO BE ACCEPTED, AND APPROVED.
02:50:35.729: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THAT FRIENDLY TO THE BODY? COUNCILMEMBER NELSON, YOU AREN MUTE.
02:50:42.669: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I HAVE A QUESTION. I DON'T THINK I UNDERSTOOD SOME OF WHAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT, COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI. YOU SAID SOMETHING ABOUT FEBRUARY AND I DIDN'T KNOW -- I -- I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND --
02:50:53.747: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THAT'S FOR THE OTHER RESOLVE CLAUSE ABOUT MEETING WITH THE REGENTS. THAT WOULD BE IN THE SECOND RESOLVE CLAUSE, WHICH I HAVEN'T SENT ANYTHING ON YET. BUT I WOULD ALSO -- AT A LATER POINT HERE MAKE A MOTION TO CHANGE THAT TO A DIFFERENT DATE. BUT MY FIRST MOTION WAS ON THE FIRST RESOLVE CLAUSE.
02:51:15.636: >> Councilmember Nelson:  JUST CHANGE THE WORD "NEGOTIATE"?
02:51:18.005: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YEAH.
02:51:20.474: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I DON'T CARE. THAT'S NOT A SUBSTANTIVE DIFFERENCE.
02:51:25.646: >>ouncilmember Ramlawi:  A RED LINE CHANGE.
02:51:27.681: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THAT FRIENDLY TO THE BODY THEN? IT LOOKS TO ME TO BE FRIENDLY -- THIS LOOKS TO BE FRIENDLY TO THE BODY. DOES ANYONE OBJECT TO THAT?
02:51:39.493: >> Councilmember Hayner:  THIS IS A GRAMMATICAL ERROR.
02:51:44.097: >> Mayor Taylor: IMMEDIATELY TAKE STEPS TO DISCUSS WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN THE POSSIBITY --
02:51:48.235: >> Councilmember Hayner: YEAH, STRIKE THAT.
02:51:50.871: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANKS, COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
02:51:53.740: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THAT FRIENDLY TO THE BODY? ALL RIGHT. THAT'S FRIENDLY. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
02:51:59.480: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: I'M -- IF THAT'S FRIENDLY, THEN I WOULD ALSO MAKE A MOTION THEN TO CHANGE THE DATE FROM NOVEMBE FEBRUARY 1st, 2021.
02:52:16.897: >> Mayor Taylor: SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRAND. THAT IS NOT FRIENDLY.
02:52:21.668: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THAT IS ONLY TO MEET WITH THE REGENTS. THAT'S NOT PERTAINING TO THE OTHER ORGANIZATIONAL ENTITIES. AGAIN, THAT'S JUST ASKING FOR A MEETING WITH THE REGENTS. PERHAPS THIS IS NOT THE BEST PLACE FOR IT, BUT SINCE WE ARE ON TOPIC, I FIGURED I WOULD MAKE THAT MOTION.
02:52:42.022: >> Mayor Taylor: OWN THE AMENDMENT I HAVE GRISWOLD AND THEN GRAND. COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
02:52:47.327: >> Counclmember Griswold:  I DON'T HAVE A COMMENT ON THE AMENDMENT.
02:52:50.497: >> Mayor Taylor: COULD THANK YOU. COUNCILMEMBERRAND.
02:52:53.700: >> Councilmember Grand: WE HAVE REGENTS UP FOR ELECTION NOVEMBE. IT'S -- YOU KNOW, IT'S -- THERE'S GOING TO BE A SIGNIFICANT CHANGEOVER IN TERMS OF -- IN TERMS OF POLICY MAKING BODIES ON THIS COUNCIL. SO I'M NOT SURE ONE WEEK BEFORE WE LOSE HALF THE BODY IS THE BEST TIME TO GET TOGETHER WITH THE REGENTS TO DISCUSS GENERAL HOUSING POLICY AND I THINK THE CHANGE THAT COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI MADE IN THE FIRST RESOLVE CLAUSE GETS STAFF GOING, CWHICH I THINK IS THE PROCESS. I THINK AS WE MAKE THE CHANGE, I CAN DEFINITELY GET BEHIND THE RESOLUTION. I THINK IT'S MUCH MORE REALISTIC THAT WE COULD SET UP A MEETING IN A FEW MONTH'S TIME WITH THE REGENT 'S A MORE REASONABLE ASK.
02:53:38.946: >> Mayor Taylor: WE ALL THINK WHAT WE THINK ABOUT THIS AND WE PROBABLY DON'T NEED TO TALK ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR AMENDMENT. WE SHOULD JUST VOTE ON IT. BUT THAT'S JUST -- THAT'S JUST ME. I HAVE GRISWOLD, EATON.
02:53:52.626: >> CAN I MAKE A COMMENT ON THIS?
02:53:55.896: >> Mayoraylor: YES MR. CRFO.
02:53:59.232: >> City Admin. Crawford: AS OUTLIYOUTHINK ABOUT A MEETING WE UNIVERSITY, I THINK SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL IS -- INSTEAD OF APPROACHING UNIVERSITY ON A TOPIC-BY-TOPIC, I HAVE THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR THE COUNCIL TO PRIORITIZE WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR FROM THE UNIVERSITY. IN MY EXPERIENCE WITH THE UNIVERSITY, GOING FROM TOPIC TO TOPIC IS N AS PRODUCTIVE AND I THINK THAT WOULD BE EVEN LESS PRODUCTIVE AT THE POLICY LEVEL. I THINK IF THE UNIVERSITY UNDERSTANDS THE COMMUNITY'S -- WE HAVE A DIALOGUE AROUND WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT OR HOW IMPORTANT IS CLIMATE ACTION IS THE FIRE STATION, IS THE HOUSING, THESE ARE THINGS THAT THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DO ALL, BUT THEY NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF SOME O THE TH THINGS IN ORDER TO MESH THAT WITH THEIR OTHER PRIORITIES THAT THEY ARE PURSUING.
02:54:53.720: >> Mayor Taylor: I GUESS LET ME -- MR. CRAWFORD, WOULD YOU -- WOULD YOU THINK THAT SOME SORT OF CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT WOULD BE SUITABLE FOR THE DECEMBER OFF SITE?
02:55:03.463: >> City Admin. Crawford: IF YOU ASME, I THINK THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT MAYBE -- IT COULD AN OFF SITE AND SOMETHING THAT THE COUNCIL WORKS WITH. IF YOU MEET WITH THE REGENTS WED TO BE WELL-PREPARED FOR THE CONVERSATION, NOT ONLY WITH OUR PRIORITIES BUT VERY SPECIFIC POINTS AND KNOWLEDGE AROUND WHAT WE WANT, HOW, WHY AND HOWT WOULD WORK FOR BOTH. I THINK THERE'S A FAIR BIT OF CONVERSATION. IT'S MAY BE MORE THAN PRIORITIZATION. IF IT WAS JUST PRIORITIZATION, WE COULD DO THAT. JUST REALIZE IT WOULD BE PREPARATION IN ADDITION TO THAT.
02:55:50.777: >> Mayor Taylor: GHIZ WALD, EATON AND BANISTER.
02:55:52.579: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS RESOLUTION AND I SERVE ON THE MICHIGAN LEAD BOARD OF GOVERNORS AND THAT GIVES ME SOME INSIGHT INTO THE UNIVERSITY, AS AS WL.LMEMBER GRAND PROBABLY HAS I WOULD SEE THIS REQUEST FOR A CONVERSATION AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO HELP THEM WITH A MAJOR P R. PROBLEM THAT THEY HAVE RIGHT NOW. ANYONE WHO HAS SEEN REDDIT KNOWS THEY HAVE REAL PROBLEMS. AND WORKING WITH THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR WOULD BE A REAL OPPORTUNITY FOR THE UNIVERSITY AT THIS TIME.
02:56:45.298: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
02:56:48.735: >> Councilmember Eaton: I THINK PUTTING OFF A MEETING UIL FEBRUA, FAILS TO REALIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS. WE ARE LIKELY TO ENTER THE SECOND WAVE OF THE PANDEMIC SHORTLY. THAT WILL IMPACT OUR ECONOMY IN HUGE WAYS. THE RECESSION IS GOING TO TAKE OFF IF WE GET A SECOND WAVE OF THE M PANMIC. OTHER UNIVERSITIES HAVE BEEN TENDING PERSON-TO-PERSON CLASSES BASED ON THE INCIDENTS OF THE VIRUS ON CAMPUSES. SO IF THE UNIVERSITY POLLS UNITE WITH THETHER LARGE UNIVERSITIES, AND STOPS IN-PERSON TEACHING. THERE WILL BE A BUNCH OF HOUSING. THE RECESSION WILL CAUSE US SHORT-TERM HOUSING PROBLEMS THAT I DON'T THINK THAT WE ARE REALLY FOCUSING ON HERE AS WE TRY TO PUT THIS MEETING OFF INTO THE END OF THE WINTER. ISESOLUTION IS TRYING TO ADDRESS WITH A SENSE OF URGENCY PROBLEMS THAT ARE PRETTY EVIDENT TO ANYBODY WHO IS PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT IS HAPPENING EVERYWHERE ELSE. EUROPE IS CURRENTLY ENTERING A SECOND WAVE OF THE PANDEMIC, AND THAT'S NOT GOING TO ESCAPE US. THE GOVERNOR ANNOUNCED THAT SHE INTENDS TO CONTINUE HER EMERGENCY ORDERS FOR A COUPLE MORE MONTHS, AT LEAST. WE'RE NOT COMING OUT OF THIS. AND IF WE JUST PUSH THIS OFF, AND TRY TO BUNDLE IT WITH A BUNCH OF OTHER ISSUES, IT IGNORES WHAT THIS RESOLUTION INITIALLY TRIED TO ADDRESS AND THAT'S ALL OF THESE ISSUES THAT HA GREAT DEGREE OF URGENCY. SO I THINK THAT -- I DON'T WANT TO PUT IT OFF UNTIL FEBRUARY AND I SUPPORT WHAT THE RESOLUTION ORIGINALLY INTENDED TO DO AND I WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT IT.
02:58:59.599: >> Mayor Taylor: ON THE AMENDMENT, COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER AND HAYNER. COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
02:59:05.772: >> Councilmember Bannister:  I SUPPORT THE ORIGINAL RESOLUTION ALSO, BECAUSE I THINK WE MAY NEED TO REVISIT OUR CONFLICT OF INTEREST POLICIES BECAUSE -- AND MAYBE THIS IS A QUESTION FOR THE ATTORNEY'S OFFICE, BUT, YOU KNOW, IF FOLKS ARE RECEIVING A PAY CHECK FROM U OF M, ARE THEY WITH OUR CONFLICT OF INTEREST POLICY TO BE ALSO REPRESENTING THE BEST INTEREST OF THE RESIDENTS?
02:59:39.172: >> Councilmember Grand: I WOULD LIKE TO RESPOND TO THAT.
02:59:41.574: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
02:59:42.842: >> Councilmember Bannister:  I MIGHT PREFER TO HEAR DIRECTLY FROM THE ATTORNEY'S OFFICE, POSSIBLY.
02:59:47.681: >> Couilmeerra: SINCE IT WAS DIRTED AT ME, I WOULD LIKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO REFOND THAT.
02:59:50.817: >> Councilmember Bannister:  I DIDN'T MEAN TO DIRECT IT TO YOU.
02:59:54.020: >> Councilmember Grand: SURE IT WASN'T. FINE, FORGET IT.
02:59:57.857: >> Councilmember Bannister: I'M SPEAKING OF OUR -- JUST THE RULES COMMITTEE IS MEETING TOMORROW MORNING. I HAVE MY GREEN FOLDER HERE AND ON CFLICTS OF INTEREST, BUT DO WE HAVE A STAFF MEMBER WHO IS UP TO SPEED ON --
03:00:17.844: >> Councilmember Ackerman: CAN WE VOTE ON THE AMENDMENT.
03:00:21.915: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. McDONALD?
03:00:22.916: >> COUNCILMEMBER, ARE YOU YOU AE CONCERNED THAT A COUNCILMEMBER WHO WORKS FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CHIGAN SHOUL NOT MEET WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN ON THESE PARTICULAR TOPICS?
03:00:36.162: >> Councilmember Bannister: NO, I THINK A MEETING IS FINE BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE WISE AT THIS JUNCTURE FOR US TO EXPLORE WHETHER A -- WHETHER AND TO WHAT DEGREE A CONFLICT OF INTEREST CAN EXIST WHERE IF YOUR EMPLOYER IS PAYING YOU A LOT OF MONEY TO WORK FOR THEM, CAN YOU REALLY BE OBJECTIVE WHEN YOU ARE NEGOTIATING AEROBIC TALKING WITH THEM ABOUT HOUSING FOR OUR HOMELESS PEOPLE?
03:01:07.494: >> WELL, IN GENERAL, I DON'T BELIEVE THE COUNCIL RULES PREVENT SOMEBODY FROM SORT OF NEGOTIATING THAT TYPE OF POSITION UNLESS THEY HAVE SOME FINANCIAINTEST IN T CONTRACT ITSELF. A GENERAL ISSUE SUCH AS HOUSING OR A TOPIC LIKE THAT CERTAINLY CAN BE DISCUSSED BY ANY COUNCILMEMBER WITH MEMBERS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN.
03:01:35.955: >> Councilmember Bannister:  I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WE HAVE A MORE APPROPRIATE VENUE.
03:01:46.433: >> Mayor Taylor: I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE ON THIS. I WOULD SAY BY WAY OF HISTORY, WE HAD A MAYOR WHO WAS AN EMPLOYEE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN FOR  14 YEARS. AND A COUNCILMAN WHO WAS WITH UNIVERSITY FOR 7 OR 8 YEARS AND COUNCILMEMBER GRAND HAS BEEN AN EMPLOYEE WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND CERTAINLY A NUMBER OF US AS WELL. THOSE SORTS OF RELATIONSHIPS HAVE NEVER BEEN DEEMED TO BE A CONFLICTFNTEREST, NORO I BELIEVE THEM TO BE.
03:02:33.213: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I'M NOT AFRAID TO ASK FOR THE UNIVERSITY MEETING. I WON'T SUPPORT THIS NOTION. AND I WOULD ALSO -- JUST SINCE WE ARE ON THE TOPIC, I WOULD LIKE TO ADDHAT, YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY -- I ACTUALLY SEVERED BY -- ANY CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIPS OR VENDOR STATUSES I HAD WITH THE UNIVERSITY WHEN I SWORE MY CITY COUNCIL OATH. I HAD A HANDFUL OF JOBS WHERE I DID INFORMATION DESIGN AND PRODUCTION OF DONOR RECOGNITION AND SO ON, AND I HAD TO PUT ALL OF THAT TO BED. I DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE A SUGGESTION THAT IN MY WAY THAT SOMEHOW I'M BEHOLDEN TO THE UNIVERSITY. THAT'S THE WAY IT IS. IF WE CAN'T CAN FOR A MEETING WITH THE REG REGENTS WHEN ONE PERSON -- IF THERE'S A CONCERN TH WE CAN'T ASK FOR A MEETING BECAUSE OF PEOPLE ON THE COUNCIL BEING ON THE UNIVERSITY PAYROLL, I THINK THAT'S TERRIBLE AND IF IT'S HAPPENING NOW, WHAT WILL HAPPEN WHEN A THIRD OF THE COUNCIL IS GETTING A PAY CHECK AND THAT'S GOING TO BE WHAT IS GOING TO BE THE CASE AFTER NOVEMBER WHEN THE NEW COUNCIL IS SWORN IN. I WOULD LIKE TO PUT THIS NOTION ASIDE THAT THERE'S A CONFLICT OF INTEREST HERE, BUT, YOU KNOW, POTENTIALLY THERE IS, AND I THINK WHAT ARE WE AFRAID OF? WE CAN'T EVEN ASK FOR A MEETING WITH THE BIGGEST LAND HOLDER OF THE MEETING WITH THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN SUCH AN INTEGRAL PART OF OUR COMMUNITY? COME ON! WE SHOULD ASK FOR A MEETING AND WE SHOULD GET IT.
03:04:06.339: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER SMITH.
03:04:07.907: >> Councilmember Smith: CAN WE JUST VOTE ON THIS AMENDMENT? THIS CONVERSATN IS TAKING ABSURD TURN THAT'S NOT WORTH COMMENTING ON. I THINK EVERYBODY HAS SPOKE TONE THIS, EXCEPT FOR ME, AND I WILL SUPPORT THE AMENDMENT. I SUPPORT THE IDEA HERE. BUT WE HAVE BEEN AT THIS FOR A WHILE.
03:04:30.029: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
03:04:30.897: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I DO NOSUPPORT THI AMEMENT, BECAUSE I DON'T THINK PHING IT OFF TO FEBRUARY HAS MUCH VALUE, BUT IF THIS AMENDMENT FAILS I WOULD OFFER -- I WOULD -- I WOULD OFFER TO CHANGE THE RESOLVE CLAUSE THE SECOND TO LAST ONE THAT NAMES NOVEMBER 1st, I WILL CHANGE IT TO SAY -- TO DISCU ANN ARBOR EMERGENCY -- ANN ARBOR EMERGENCY SHELTER NEEDS AND TAKE AWAY BOTH TEMPORARY AND LONG-TERM, SO THAT IT WOULD BE A MUCH MORE NARROWLY FOCUSED MEETING ON JUST THE TOPIC THAT ACTUALLY NEEDS TO BE DISCUSSED RIGHT AWAY AS OPPOSED TO TOPICS THAT DON'T NECESSARILY NEED TO BE TALKED ABOUT RIGHT AWAY. AT ANY RATE, I WOULD ASK MY COLLEAGUES TO NOT SUPPORT THIS AMENDMENT, BECAUSE I'M WILLING TO AMEND THIS RESOLVE CLAUSE BOUGHT I THOUGHT IT WAS A MORE NARROWLY TAILORED CONVERSATION THE PRIOR IS TO MAKE THE CONVERSATION HAPPEN SOONER RATHER TAN LATER. -- RATHER THAN LATER.
03:05:32.225: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE AMENDMENT? STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER MEMBER GRISWOLD.
03:05:44.637: >> Councilmember Griswold: NO.
03:05:49.008: >> Councilmember Lumm: NO.
03:05:49.609: >> Councilmember Grand: YES.
03:05:50.209: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES.
03:05:55.982: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.

03:06:10.229: >> Councilmember Bannister: NO.
03:06:13.066: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION FAILS.
03:06:14.701: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN MOTION? COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
03:06:19.639: >> Councilmember Nelson:  SO I WOULD LIKE TO OFFER THE AMENDMENT THAT -- I MEAN, DO I HAVE TO SEND THE WORDING TO YOU, JACKIE?
03:06:28.448: >> Councilmember Smith: YES.
03:06:29.048: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I WILL SEN SEND THE WORDING. I WILL COPY AND PASTE THIS. HOLD ON A SECOND. SORRY.
03:06:38.658: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I HAVE A QUESTION IN THE MEANTIME, I WOULD LIKE TO ASK TOM CRAWFORD. THE REASON I SUPPORTED THE PRIOR DEFEATED AMENDMENT WAS -- IT WAS GOING TO BE HARD TO GET A MEETING SCHEDULED --
03:06:53.172: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER, I THINK COUNCILMEMBER NELSON HAS THE FLOOR, IF SHE CEDES IT, THAT'S OKAY. COUNCILMEMBER NELSON?
03:07:01.614: >> Councilmember Nelson: OKAY. I'M SENDING THIS NOW TO JACKIE AND THEN -- WAIT. OKAY. ALL RIGHT. I HAVE SENT IT TO JACKIE. THE WORDING IS RESOLVE THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR IS DIRECTED TO SCHEDULE A MEETING BETWEEN THE CITY COUNCIL OF ANN ARBOR AND THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF NOVEMBER 1st, 2020, TO DISCUSS ANN ARBOR TEMPORARY EMERGENCY SHELTER NEEDS.
03:07:32.545: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE A SECOND? SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER EATON. IS THAT FRIENDLY TO THE BODY? I SEE IT IS NOT FRIENDLY FROM COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI. COUNCILMEMBER NELSON, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR STILL. I HAVE NOTHING MORE TO SAY. I T'S BEENAID BEFORE. I DON'T WANT TO DRAG THIS OUT. I JUST DON'T THINK THAT THIS PARTICULAR CONVERSATION CAN BE DELAYED AND IT'S A PRETTY NARROW TOPIC. SO I HOPE YOU CAN SUPPORT THIS AMENDMENT.
03:07:59.205: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE AMENDMENT. COUNCILMEMBER RAM LAUGHY?
03:08:06.979: >> CLAUGH --RAMLAWI.
03:08:09.715: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I SAY I WON'T SUPPORT IT, BECAUSE I DON'T THINK IT'S FEASIBLE. WE HEARD FROM THE ADMINISTRATOR THAT IT BE THERE DIFFICULT AND WE NEED TO HAVE PREPARATION SO WE DON'T SOUND LIKE A BUNCH OF BOZOS AND HALF THIS COUNCIL IS NOT GOING TO BE AROUND TWO WEEKS LATER. AND SO I JUST -- I APOGIZEUT I CAN'T SUPPORT IT, BASED ON THOSE TENETS. IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE VERY PRACTICAL AND THAT'S WHY I CAN'T SUPPORT IT.
03:08:43.649: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
03:08:49.856: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES.
03:08:55.127: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES.

03:08:58.631: >> Councilmember Ackerman: NO.
03:09:06.806: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
03:09:07.306: >> Councilmember Eaton: I'M SORRY, WHAT ARE WE VOTING ON?

03:09:27.593: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION CARRIES.
03:09:33.165: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN MOTN? BEFORE GOING TO COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN, I DON'T WANT TO MAKE TOO BIG OF A DEAL OF THIS, WE ARE DIRECTING THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR TO SCHEDULE A MEETING. IT TAKES TWO TO TANGO. PERHAPS WE DIRECT THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR TO SEEK TO SCHEDULE A MEETING OR TWO, STRIVE TO SCHEDULE A MEETING WHAT DO WE THINK OF THAT? THAT WAY -- IS THAT -- IF I COULD HAVE SOMEONE MAKE THAT AMENDMENT? COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN?
03:10:09.268: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: SECOND.
03:10:11.871: >> Mayor Taylor: SO AMENDMENT TO THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR IS DIRECTED TO SEEK A MEETING -- TO SEEK TO SCHEDULE A MEETING BETWEEN BLAH, BLAH, BLAH. HAT FRIENDLY TO THE BODY? THANK YOU. FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN MOTION AS AMENDED? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
03:10:30.389: >> Councilmember Hayner:  DOES ANYBODY ON THIS BODY FEEL THAT THEY ARE IN ANY WAY PREVENTED FROM REACHING OUT TO REGENTS ON THEIR OWN OR PEOPLE AT THE UNIVERSITY OR ADMINISTRATORS OR STAFF OR FOLKS IN CHARGE OF PROGRAMS? COMMUNICATE WITH OUR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS AND PARTNERS AND PARTNERS IN THENEIGHBORHOOD. I WOULD URGE FOLKS INTERESTED IN DOING THAT, TO REACH OUT TO REGENTS THAT YOU MAY BE IN CONTACT WITH OR OTHER PEOPLE AT THE UNIVERSITY AND ENCOURAGE THEM TO COME TO THE TABLE WITH US. THAT'S ALL. I THINK THISESOLUTION ASKING FOR THAT IS -- IT'S SHOCKING THAT WE PASSED THIS MUCH. I THINK LET'S JUST -- LET'S JUST TRY AND PARTNER UP WITH SOME PEOPLE FOR ONCE. YOU DON'T MAKE PEACE WITH OUR FRIENDS, YOU KNOW? DIMISSIODIVISION, YOU'VE GOT TOH OUT TO PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT YOUR FRIENDS. SO IF THAT'S THE FEELING, LET'S TALK TO THE REGENTS HERE. I MEAN, SOMETHING -- CLEARLY SOMETHING IS GOING ON HERE THAT PEOPLE ARE AFRAID TO EVEN HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS AND THAT'S JUST GOT TO END. IT'S GOT TO END.
03:11:52.238: >> Councilmember Eaton: I WOULD POINT OUT THAT NONE OF CUSS SPEAK ON -- OF CUSS US CAN SPEAN BEHALF OF THE ENTIRE COUNCIL AND NO REGENT CAN HAVE SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE ENTIRE REGENTS. SO THE ONLY WAY TO HAVE A MEANINGFUL DISCUSSION IS T MEET AS BODIES. I ENCOURAGE YOU. YOU CAN'T MAKE A DEAL WITH ANY SINGLE REGENT. I WOULD HOPE THAT YOU RECOGNIZE THAT.
03:12:22.702: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
03:12:23.602: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANKS, MR. MAYOR. I THINK ULTIMATELY, I WILL BE VOTING FOR THIS, BUT I WANT TO PROVIDE SOME FEEDBACK ABOUT THE CONVERSATION. HE THINKI THINK SOME OF THE TONE IMPACT DIMINISHES WHAT THE STAFF HAS WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN. OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD, I LISTED SOME SUCCESSES THAT STAFF HAVE HAD, SOME OF WHICH HAS BEEN IN THE LAST MONTHS AND LAST YEAR. THE 404 NORTH ASHLEY AFFORDABLE HOUSING SITE. THE UNIVERSITY'S COMMUNITY DENTAL CLINIC. RERFACING SOUTH UNIVERSITY, ANNUALLY COORDINATING THE ART FAIR, COORDINATING DISASTER PLANS, COORDINATING SPORTING EXES AND A MASSIVE FIELD HOSPITAL IN RESPONSE TO COVID. THAT'S MY LIMITED KNOWLEDGE OF THE INNER WORKINGS THE CITY AND THEIR ABILITY TO COORDINATE WITH STAFF. I DON'T DOUBT IF WE SET THEM ON A TASS T TASK THAT THEY WOULD BE TO COMET IT TO A BETTER ABILITY THAN WE WOULD. I THINK TO SOME EXTENT WE GOT INTO A CONVERSATION ABOUT LEGISLATIVE OUTLOOK CALENDARS WHICH I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO DO I THINK THE FACT THAT MR. CRAWFORD REACHED OUT TO UNIVERSITY IN ANTICIPATION OF THIS RESOLUTION, DEMONSTRATIONS THAT A RESOLUTION THIS IS NOT NECESSARY BECAUSE MR. CRAWFORD ALREADYATISFIED PARTS OF THE GOALS O RESOLUTION IN THAT OUTREACH. THI THINK THESE PERSONAL CONNECTIONS AND CHANNELS WOULD SERVE US MUCH BETTER THAN IN THE FORM OF PAPER. I THINK WE NEED TO TRUST MR. CRAWFORD. WE ENTRUSTED MANY CRAWFORD OVER THE YEARS WITH BLION OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS IN OUR BUDGET. WE ENTRUFF ENTRUSTED HIM TO BE D NEGOTIATOR IN MULTI MILLION DOLLARS REAL ESTATE DEALS. MR. CRAWFORD PLAINLY SAID THAT THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY WE CAN DELIVER A MESSAGE IS TO DELEVER ONE UNIFIED MESSAGE THAT BALANCES ALL OF OUR PRIORITIES REQUESTS THAT CUT ACROSSNS AND MULTIPLE ISSUES AS OPPOSED TO POPCORNING WHEN A SPECIFIC TOPIC COMES UP. I THINK OVER THE NEXT SIX WEEKS ON A TIME LIMITED TOPIC WHEN WE HAVE A LARGE STAGE, POLICY BOARD TI IN YEARS IS THE BEST WAY TO USE THAT STAGE.
03:14:53.285: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. ROLL CALL VOTE STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD
03:15:04.897: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES.
03:15:11.437: >> Councilmember Lumm: YES.

03:15:35.394: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES.
03:15:36.996: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION CARRIES.
03:15:49.475: >> Mayor Tayr: DC-5, RESOLUTION TO CONDUCT A 2020 BUDGET PRIORITIES CITIZEN SURVEY TO INFORM DEVELOPMENT OF CITY'S FY22 BUDGET AND FY23 FINANCIAL PLAN. MOVED BY LUMM, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER EATON. DISCUSSION, PLEASE, OF DC-5. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
03:16:05.524: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. THIS RESOLUTION IS VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD. IT'S TO CONDUCT A SECD CITIZEN SUEY OF BUDGET PRIORITIES TO INFORM THE UPCOMING BUDGET CYCLE DELIBERATIONS. THE FIRST SURVEY WAS TWO YEARS AGO AND THE INPUT WAS VALUABLE AND UTILIZED IN SHAPING THE BUDGET AND FINANCIAL PLAN. MUCH HAS CHANGED SINCE THEN. THE COST TO CONDUCT THE SURVEY IS MINIMAL, JUST $10,000 TO MR. HORNING AND THE VALUE OF THE UPDATED INFOATION FAR EXCEEDS THE SMALL COST TO OBTAIN IT. SPECIFICALLY, THE RESOLUTION IS TO HAVE A SIMILAR SURVEY TO THE 2018 SURVEY CONDUCTED BY THE NATIONAL RESEARCH CENTER WITH THE TARGETED TO HAVE THE RESULTS AVAILABLE IN DECEMBER OR JANUARY, PRIOR TO THE START OF BUDGET WORK SESSIONS. THE RESOLUTION PROVIDES THE MINISTRATOR THE FLEXIBILITY BUT STIPULATES THAT A AT A MINIMUM, SPECIFIC PRIORITY ASSESSMENT ON SPECIFIC BUDGET CATEGORIES AS WELL AS RATINGS OF CITY GOVERNMENT PERFORMANCE. THE RESOLUTION DIRECTS THE ADMINISTRATOR TO REPORT TO COUNCIL STAFF'S RECMENDATNS AND THE CAST AND FUNDING SOURCE SO COUNCIL COULD MAKE ADJUSTMENTS, BUT DO SO WITHOUT ANY SUBSTANTIVE DELAY. THERE'S COMPELLING REASONS TO ASK RESIDENTS WHAT THEIR BUDGET AND SPENDING PRIORITIES ARE. EQUALLY COMPELLING REASONS TO CONDUCT THE SURVEY UPDATE NOW. AT THE TOP OF THE LIST IS THE SIMPLE REALITY THAT A KEY ELEMENT OF AN EFFECTIVE LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS A ALIGNING SPENDING WITH THE PRY ORITIES OF THE CITIZENS IT SERVES. IT IS THEIR MONEY. TAXPAYERS SHOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO LET EFEBRUARIED D OFFICIALS KNOW HOW THEIR TAX DOLLARS SHOULD BE SPENT. BUDGET AND SPENDING PRIORITIES CERTAINLMEETS THAT STAARD. I BROUGHT THIS FORWARD INITIALLY BECAUSE I STRONGLY BELIEVE WE SHOULD ON A REGULAR BASIS TOUCH BASE WITH CITIZENS ON THEIR SPENDING PRIORITY. I CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT. THE UPCOMING BUDGET IS THE FIRST YEAR OF THE TWO-YEAR CYCLE WHERE SC '23LAN WILL BE ADOPTED THE BY COUNCIL. HAVING CURRENT INFORMATION ON COMMUNITY PREFERENCES WOULD CERTAINLY BE HELPFUL IN INFORMING THOSE DISCUSSIONS AND DECISIONS. WHY DO A SECOND SURVEY? THE SITUATION HAS CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM 2018. WE HAVE THE PANDEMIC-RELATED FINANCIAL CHALLENGES, EMBARKING INGON AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND A2O INITIATIVE. PLUS, LIKE THE NATIONAL CITY SURVEY, WHICH WE DO EVERY TWO YEARS, THERE IS VALUABLE INSIGHT TO BE GAINED BY EVALUATING THE SURVEY TRENDS OVER TIME AND WORKING WITH FRESH DATA. THERE IS A PRIORITY BASED BUDGETING APPROACH AND THAT'S EAT. E PERIODIC SURVEYS ARE CONSISTENT WITH AND COMPLIMENT THE PBD. IT DOES NOT HAVE A TOOL THAT DRILLS DOWN ON RESIDENT PRIORITIES TO THE DEGREE THE SURVEY DOES. IN TALKING TO MR. CRAWFORD AND MR. HORNING, THE COST ISBOUT $10,000 AND IT COULD BE DONE IN TIME TO INFORM THE UPCOMING BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS. IT'S A QUESTION OF COST AND BENEFIT. IN THIS CASE, THE COST IS VERY SMALL, JUST $10,000 AND I BELIEVE THE VALUE AND THE BENEFIT OF THE INFORMATION IS HIGH. IT'S JUST HARD FOR ME TO SEE HOW A COUNCILMEMBER WOULD CONCLUDE IT'S NOT WORTH A SMALL INVESTMENT TO ENSURE W HAVE THE UNIVERSITY'S CURRENT VIEWS ON SPENDING PRIORITIES TO INFORM BUDGET DELIBERATIONS. I HOPE YOU WILL ALL AGREE AND THANKS FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.
03:20:01.827: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER GRAND?
03:20:05.998: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. I DIDN'T SUPPORT THIS THE FIRST TIME AROUND THAT WE TRIED TO DO, THIS AND WILL NOT SUPPORT IT AGAIN THIS EVENING. SURVEYS ARE COMPLICATED ABOUT BUDGET. I BELIEVE THE CITY IS COMMITTED TO WORKING TOWARDS PR PRIORITY-BASED BUDGETING AND I WOULD RATHER THEY MOVE FORWARD AT THAT, THAT LOOKS AT VALUES, TRADEOFFS, THE SURVEYS WE HAVE DONE I THEAST AUT BUDTS AND THE ONE I BELIEVE IS BEING PROPOSED -- ONE I BELIEVE IS BEING PROPOSED IS TELL US WHAT YOU LIKE AND WHAT SHOULD WE SPEND MONEY ON. IT'S NOT TAKING INFORMATION INTO CONTEXT WITH THE EXPERT INFORMATION FROM OUR STAFF. SO I BELIEVE IT'S REALLY A WASTE OF FUNDS TSK PEOPLE TO JUST BLANKLY RANK THEIR PRIORITIES WITHOUT CONTEXT, WHICH I THINK LAST SURVEY DID AND I BELIEVE THIS ONE -- WE'RE TRYING TO DUPLICATE IT AND I BELIEVE IT'S AN INSUFFICIENT INPUT. I PERSONALLY DON'T SEE THE UTILITY IN THIS SURVEY. SO I RESPECT WHERE IT'S COMING FROM, BUT I THINK THERE IS JUST AN OVERESTIMATION OF THE VALUE OF THIS SURVEY IN INFORMING OUR DECISIONS AND I HAVE NOT SIGNATLEGISLATED BY SURVEYING IE PAST AND I DON'T INTEND TO DO SO IN THE PAST.
03:21:42.761: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU TO COUNCILMEMBER LUMM FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. I APPRECIATE THIS. I WILL BE SUPPORTING IT JUST LIKE I DID IN PREVIOUS YEARS. I THINK IT'S MORE IMPORTANT NOW THAN IT WAS BEFORE, IN FACT, WE ARE ENTERING A LONG, PROTRACTED RECESSION. WE HAVE A NEW COUNCIL COMING OONBOARD. THIS YEAR, I DON'T THINK THE NEWLY ELECTED OFFICIALS GOT THE OPPORTUNITY MOST OF US DID WITH KNOCKING ON DOORS AND TALKING TO FOLKS FACE TO FACE AND GETTING REALLY HONEST ANSWERS TO CONCERNS THAT FOLKS HAVE. IHINK THIS WILL SERVE AS AN EXTRA DATA POINT. I WOULDN'T BASE ALL OF MY DECISIONS FROM THE RESULTS OF THIS SURVEY. IT'S $10,000, $14,000 RELATIVE TO PAY NEARLY HALF BILLION DOLLARS BUDGET. I DON'T SEE IT BEING A SIGNIFICANT COST WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE TOTAL AMOUNT SPENT, $1 BILLION. I THINK IT'S, AGAIN MORE VALUABLE NOW THAN IT HAS BEEN BEFORE BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC AND THE LACK OF CONCT WE HAVE WITH OUR CONSTITUENTS. WE CAN'T MEET WITH PEOPLE AS WE NORMALLY DID. I THINK WE ARE FLYING IN THE DARK MORE THAN WE USED TO.
03:23:13.652: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER SMITH.
03:23:16.988: >> Councilmember Smith: COUNCILM EMBER GRAND HIT ON A LOT OF POINTS THAT I WAS GOING TO MAKE, NAMELY THAT I THINK LEGISLATING BY SURVEY IS KIND OF AN ABDI ABDICATION OF LEADERSHIP. I THINK WE JUST HAD A COMMUNITY CONVERSATION ABOUT PRIORITIES AND THAT WAS THE ELECTION AND THERE WERE RESULTS OF THAT. I THINK THAT THAT IS UP TO THE NEW FOLKS TO FIGURE THAT OUT AND SET THE POLICY AND DEVELOP A BUDGET GOING FORWARD. I THINK THAT WE HAVE ARGUED ABOUT LESS MONEY THAN THIS BEFORE. IN FACT, WE ARGUED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IT THIS EVENING. I JUST THINK THAT MR. HORNING IS IT A USEFUL DATA POINT FOR YOU IN DEVELOPING THE PRIORITY BASED BUDGETING INFORMATION? I DON'T SEE HOW IT'S NOT SUPERFLUOUS.
03:24:15.447: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
03:24:16.381: >> Councilmember Grand: I HAD A LOGISTICAL QUESTION. IF WE HAD TO APPROVE THIS SURVEY TONIGHT, WHEN WOULD IT ACTUALLY ROLL OUT?
03:24:22.721: >> City Admin. Crawford: MR. HOR NING IS HERE TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS ON THE SURVEY.
03:24:31.863: >> WE HAVE ALREADY REAED OUT TO THE COMPANY THAT CONDUCTED THE PRIOR SURVEY AND THEY SAID THEY WOULD REPLICATE IT RELATIVELY QUICKLY AT A LOW COST. I'M SURE THAT WE WOULD NEED TO REVIEW THE SURVEY ITSELF, AND UPDATE IT SO IT WAS ASKING TIMELY QUESTIONS AND PERTINENT THERE Y BE A LITTLE BIT OF AN ADDITIONAL COST, BUT I WOULD IMAGINE THE TIMELINE WOULD BE SIMILAR TO THE LAST ONE WHICH I THINK WAS TWO MONTHS FROM START TO END. SO BY THE END OF CALENDAR YEAR.
03:25:06.131: >> Councilmember Grand: BUT WHEN WOULD IT GO OUT TO RESIDENTS OR GO UP ON THE CITY'S WEBSITE?
03:25:11.736: >> City Admin. Crawford: IT'S PROBABLY TO EARLY TO GIVE YOU AN EXACT DATE, BUT I WLD IMAGINE AROUND NOVEMBER 1st.
03:25:18.109: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. IF WAS GOING TO BE LATER, I MIGHT HAVE A DIFFERENT RESPONSE. THANKS.
03:25:28.286: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
03:25:29.354: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU, MR. HORNING. THANKS FOR REACHING OUT TORT COMPANY THAT DID THIS -- TO THE COMPANY THAT DID THIS BEFORE, THE ORGANIZATION. TO ADDRESS A CPL OF CONCERNS. COUNCILMEMBER GRAND, THIS -- AND I -- THE -- ONE THE WHEREAS [ APPLAUSE ] WHEREASCLAUSES REFERENCED THE D, THAT THIS WOULD SOLICIT FEEDBACK FROM OUR TAXPAYER RESIDENTS ON SPENDING ON 57 SPECIFIC BUDGET CATEGORIES LIKE WE DID LAST TIME. FOR EACH CATEGORY, WE ASKED RESIDENTS IF THEY WOULD INCREASE, DECREASE OR KEEP SPENDING. THIS WAS A LOT OF CONTEXT PROVIDED IN THE SURVEY. AND THE SURVEY ALSO OBTAINED CITIZEN FEEDBACK AND ON THE PERFORMANCE. GOVERNMENT THERE'S MORE DETAIL AND THERE'S CONTEXT PROVIDED. AND THEN JUST TO ADDRESS -- AND I WILL SAY, I KNOCKED ON HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF DOORS AT A SOCIAL DISTANCE AND WEARING A MASK AND THIS KIND OF DETAIL DID NOT COME UP IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS. PEOPLE WERE VERY WILLING TO SHARE THEIR FEEDBACK ON ALL KINDOF THINGS AND -- I MEAN JUST IN TERMS OF SPENDING OTHER THAN AFTER OVER AND OVER AGAIN, FIX THE ROADS, THERE WASN'T THIS KIND OF INFORMATION THAT WE OBTAINED PREVIOUSLY AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO UPDATE. I APPRECIATE THE RESPONSE TO THE Q&A RESPONSE FROM MR. NELSON. IF YOU LOOK AT THE PBB FEEDBACK TOOL THAT WAS SHOWN IN LAWRENCE, CAKANSAS MATERIAL, IT'S JUST A FEEDBACK BOX. AND SURVEYS, ON THE OTHER HAND, -- SO THEY DON'T SUBSTITUTE FOR PBB OR ANY OF I TOOLS BUT THEY GENERATE COMPLIMENTARY AND SUPPLEMENTAL AND UPDATED INFORMATION. A SURVEY DOES NOT MAKE ANY AUTOMATIONS IN TERMS OF WHAT -- ASSUMPTIONS IN TERMS OF WHAT THE PRIORITIES ARE. IT STARTS WITH A CLEAN SHEET AND ASK TAXPAYERS WHAT THEIR PRIORITIES ARE AND WHAT THEY DEEM ESSENTIAL. THE SURVEY MECHANISM, IT'S NOT PUT ON A WEBSITE. IT WAS DONE SCIENTIFICALLY LAST TIME. THERE WERE 2,000 PEOPLE THAT PARTICIPATED. WE GOT A LOT OF GOOD FEEDBACK AND, AGAIN, THIS IS ASKING FOLKS IN THEY WOULD SPEND MORE OR LESS THE SAME ON THESE VARIOUS PROJECT CATEGORIES AND THIS IS NOT BEING DONE TO SEE WHAT WOULD BE CUT BUT RATHER SEE HOW THEY WANT -- HOW FOLKS WANT THEIR TAX DOLLARS SPENT. AND AGAIN, WE KNOW NOW THAT IT CAN BE DOPP DONE FOR ABOUT $10,. I THINK THE COST BENEFIT IS CLEAR AND THE VALUE ADD IS CLEAR. AND I APPRECIATE IT CAN BE DONE IN A TIMELY WAY AND THANK YOU AGAIN, MR. HORNING FOR THE WORK YOU HAVE DONE TO REACH OUT ALREADY INDVANCE OF TONIGHT, AS SOON AS YOU GOT GOT THIS DRAFT TO SEE THAT IT CAN BE DONE AT A LOW COST. THANK YOU.
03:28:48.286: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN MOTION. I WILL VOTE AGAINST THIS AS I DID PREVIOUSL I THINK WE WILL BE ENGAGED IN PRIORITY BASED BUDGETING AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT. I DON'T THINK A PUBLIC OPINION SURVEY OF THIS NATURE PROVIDES SUFFICIENT CONTEXT AND SO, YOU KNOW, I EXPECT IT WILL PASS AND WE'LL RECEIVE THE DATA BUT I WILL BE LOOKING TO OTHER MEASURES AS I MAKE I MANY DECISIONS GOING FORWARD. FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE, STARTING WITH COUNCILWOMAN GRISWOLD.

03:30:24.249: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THIS IS SOMETHING THAT MANY IN OUR COMMUNITY ARE ASKING FOR, AND THAT IS A VARIANCE ON THE OUTDOOR SPACE AT THE GROTTO OPEN STADIUM -- ON STADIUM AND USING MORE THAN 10% OF THEIR INDOOR LOT T HOLD EVENTS TO SOCIALLY DISTANCE AND PERFORM LIVE MUSIC. THEY ARE ASKING FOR COUNCIL OF CONSIDERATION OF SUPPORT MYSELF AND MY COLLEAGUE, COUNCILMEMBER SMITH HAVE BEEN ASKED AND SPONSORED THIS. AND HOPEFULLY IT GETS THE SUPPORT OF COUNCIL. THE GROTTO HAS BEEN A -- AN INSTITUTION IN FIFTH WARD, AND GOOD NEIGHBORS AND GOOD STEWARDS OF CULTURE AND ENTERTAINMENT. AND SO HOPEFULLY, YOU KNOW, IT GETS UNANIMOUS SUPPORT. I THINK IT'S WELL DESERVED.
03:31:26.811: >> Mayoraylor: COUNC MEMBER GRISWOLD.
03:31:30.114: >> Councilmember Griswold: I'M WONDERING IF THERE'S ANY RISK THE DISTURBING THE RESIDENTS, BECAUSE THERE'S A NUMBER EVER RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS BEHIND THIS. HAVE RESIDENTS BEEN CONSULTED?
03:31:49.467: >>ay Taylor: MR. CRAWFORD?
03:31:52.036: >> City Admin. Crawford: I HAVE STAFF -- I WAS NOT ENGAGED THIS ON THIS TOPIC. I THINK HAVE SOME STAFF THAT CAN ANSWER THIS QUESTION.
03:31:59.244: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  THE STAGE IS FACING AWAY FROM THE RESIDENTS TOWARDS THE FORMER DEALERSHIP. SO THE SOUND WILL BE PROJECTED AWAY FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND TOWARDS THE VACANT LOT, BUT I HOPE STAFF CAN EXPLAIN MORE. SORRY. JACKIE, DO YOU SEE THE STAFF MEMBER HERE?
03:32:29.340: >> Clerk Beaudry: SORRY ABOUT THAT. I THOUGHT I MOVED HER OVER.
03:32:34.345: >> City Admin. Crawford: AND BRETT CAN HELP IF SHE'S NOT AVAILABLE.
03:32:52.931: >> Mayor Taylor: MS. DELEO.
03:32:53.531: >> HELLO. I UNDERSTAND THERE'S A QUESTN ABOUT THE NEIGHBORS, YES?
03:32:58.303: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES, IF THERE WOULD BE ANY NOISE COMPLAINTS FROM ALLOWING THIS? AND I DO WANT TO SUPPORT, IT BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE NOT GOING TO GET COMPLAINTS.
03:33:09.013: >> THAT WAS A QUESTION THAT I SPECIFICALLY ASKED TO THE MANAGER OF THE GROTTO. HEAS NOT RECEIVED ANY COMPLAINTS FROM HIS NEIGHBORS AND I BELIEVE THEY HAVE HAD A COUPLE OF EVENTS ALREADY. I DID ALSO CHECK WITH THE ZONING ADMINISTRATOR, AND THE MANAGERS OF THE C CLICK FIX, AS WELL AS THE CUSTOMER SERVICE AND THE BUILDING DEPARTMENT AND THERE HAVE BEEN NOOMPLAINTS FILED THIS SUMMER OR ANY PAST YEAR.
03:33:42.447: >> Councilmember Griswold: THANK YOU.
03:33:48.453: >> MAYOR AND COUNCIL THIS PROVIDES NO EXCEPTIONS TO THE CITY'S TYPICAL NOISE ORDINANCE AS WELL.
03:33:55.660: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. FURTHER DISCUSSION. COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
03:33:58.529: >> Councilmember Bannister:  I WILL SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION AND I ACTUALLY KNOW OF OTHER BUSINESSES WHO WOULD LIKE TO BE SIMILARLY BROUGHT FORWARD SO THAT THEY COULD USE MORE OF THIS AREA SURROUNDING THEM FOR SOCIAL DISTANCING. SO STAY TUNED FOR MORE ON THIS METHOD.
03:34:20.752: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] ALL OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. DC-7, RESOLUTION TO END THE HEALTHY STREETS INITIATIVE OUTSIDE OF THE DOWNTOWN. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM. DISCUSSION, PLEASE OF DC-7?
03:34:42.707: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THAN YOU, MAYOR TAYLOR. I'M SORRY?
03:34:46.811: >> Mayor Taylor: I WAS JUST RECOGNIZING YOU.
03:34:47.945: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A SOURCE OF CONTROVERSY AND THIS PROGRAM THAT IS BEING DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW WAS FIRST BROUGHT TO COUNCIL IN JUNE. IT WAS POSTPONED UNTIL JULY, A DECISION IN JULY WAS MADE T GO FORWARD WITH THIS PART OF A SERIES OF STREET CLOSURES THIS SUMMER. AND THIS PERTAINS TO THREE SEGMENTS THAT LIE OUTSIDE OF THE DDA DISTRICT, A PORTION THAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER TODAY DURING THE CONSENT AGENDA. I DOES NOT SUPPORT IT BACK IN JULY BECAUSE I WAS CONCERNED OF ENGINEERING AND TIMING AND COSTS, AND OF THE WHY FEEL THOSE CONCERNS ARE VALID AND THEY HAVE BEEN ECHO THROUGH ANN ARBOR. IT'S NORTH JUST ANN ARBOR RESIDENTS BUT PEOPLE COMING IN AND OUT OF ANN ARBOR. AND THERE'S PREPANDEMIC 80,000 0 COMMUTERS COMING INTO OUR CITY EACH DAY. SO THAT BEING SAID, I'M HOPING TO GET COUNSEL TILL'S SUPPORT TONIGHT TO BRING AN END TO A PART OF THE HEALTHY STREET INITIATIVES THAT HAS LED TO ESSENTIALLY DISPLACING THE CHANGERS AND HAZARDS OF BEING ON THE ROADWAY. WE MADE SOME PARTS SAFER AND CLOUGH E. IT'S LIKE A BALLOON. WE SQUEEZE IT AND IT'S DISPLACED INTO OTHER PARTS OF NEIGHBORHOODS AND STREETS AND WE HAVE REPORTS OF AGGRESSIVE DRIVING, PEOPLE CUTTING THROUGH NEIGHBORHOODS, IN ADDITION TO OTHER ERRATIC AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR BY DRIVERS. IT'S NOT JUST THE RESPONSE TO THAT, THAT I'M BRINGING IT FORWARD. IT'S ALSO BASED ON THE TIMING THIS WAS APPROVED AND DISCUSSED DURING THE HEIGHT OF THE PAEMIC, WH THE BUS SERVICES WERE REDUCES AND WHERE WEATHER WAS NICER. IT WASN'T DEPLOYED UNTIL AFTER I BELIEVE LABOR DAY. AND NOW K-12 HAS GO BACK IN PERSON. THE AAA, MONTHEST PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND MANY PRIVATE SCHOOLS ARE IN PERSON, AND THE AAATA HAS RESUMED MOST OF THEIR NORMAL SERVICES. THE WEATHER IS CHANGING. DAYLIGHT IS CHANGING. AND BESIDES THAT, THE DEPLOYMENT OF THIS PROGRAM HAS FALLEN SHORT OF EXPECTATIONS. IT'S LED TO MAJOR CONFUSION FOR PEOPLE ON THE ROADS. WHETHER THEY ARE CYCLISTS OR MOTORISTS, MANY PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S FOR. IT'S CAUSED EXTREME CONFUSION. WEEARD OF PEOPLE BEING LATE TO WORK. WE HEARD OF PEOPLE BEING LATE TO APPOINTMENTS. YOU KNOW, THERE IS NO VISION ZERO EXPERT IN ON THE CONVERSATION AND ON THE DESIGN. AND NOW THE BUDGET HAS BEEN BLOWN AND IT'S UNFORTUNATE, BUT, YOU KNOW, I CAN'TAKE RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT. AND NOW WE ARE SPENDING $45,000 ON A PROGRAM THAT HAS GROWN TO BE CONTROVERSIAL AND FRUSTRATING FOR MANY AND THANKFULLY TO THIS POINT NO ONE HAS BEEN HURT THAT I KNOW OF BECAUSE OF IT. BUT I'M CONCERNED OF THAT. SO I WOULD LIKE TO ASK SFF IF IT'S POSSIBLE. WE DID GET SOME INFORMATION TODAY ON SOME FEEDBACK, BUT IT DOESN'T GIVE US A WHOLE LOT OF INFORMATION. IT WAS A COUPLE OF DATES AND TIMED SELECTED. I DON'T THINK IT WAS COMPREHENSIVE ENOUGH TO DRAW ANY KIND OF CONCLUSIONS WHETHER IT'S FOR OR AGAINST THIS PROGRAM, THE INFORMATION WE RECEIVED FROM STAFF TODAY WAS INCOMPLETE. WHAT ABOUT THE TIMING ARE FOR FIRE AND POLICE AND WHETHER WE HAVE ANY INFORMATION ON WHETHER OUR SERVICES FOR FIRE AND POLICE HAVE BEEN AFFECTED WITH THESE LANE REDUCTIONS.
03:39:44.909: >> JACKIE, I WILL ASK THAT YOU PROMOTE IN RAYMOND HESS AND IN THE INTERIM, I WILL -- RAYMOND IS HERE.
03:39:54.752: >> Clerk Beaudry: THEY ARE ACTUALLY HERE. THEY DON'T HAVE THEIR VIDEO ON.
03:39:56.854: >> ALL RIGHT THERE. WE GO. RAYMOND, YOU HEARD THE QUESTION ABOUT FIRE AND POLICE.
03:40:05.996: >> YES, WE DID REACH OUT TO FIRE. THERE WAS A CONCERN ABOUT ONE OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD SLOW STREET DEPLOYMENTS ON CHAPIN. AND WE ASKED THE CONTRACTOR TO ADDRESS BY PULLING THE BARRICADE BACK. I HAVEN'T HAD A SPECIFIC CONVERSATION ABOUT EMERGENCY RESPONSE BUT -- AND I'M ALSO NOT AN EMERGENCY RESPONDER AND I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK FOR THEM. I WOULD THINK THAT THE LANE CLOSURE BECAUSE IT'S JUST BARRICADED WITH CONES  CONES AND BARRELS, THEY CAN PULL INTO THAT LANE CLOSURE IF THEY NEEDEDO GE BY. THOSE CLOSURES ARE STILL ACCESSIBLE. I DON'T KNOW IF THERE HAVE BEEN ANY DEPLAYS TO RESPONSE TIME. WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO ASCERTAIN THAT. AGAIN, THESE ARE IN FOR JUST OVER A WEEK. THEY WENT IN THE LAST PART OF THE WEEK PRIOR. PROVIDED IN THE MEMO THAT WENT OUT TODAY IS INCOMPLETE. OUR DATA COLLECTION WAS ALWAYS PROGRAMMED TO OCCUR IN OCTOBER. AND SO WE SCRAMBLED AND TRIED TO DO SOME TRAVEL TIME RUNS AND ASSESS THE IMPACT TO THE TRAFFIC THAT WAS OCCURRING JUST SO WE COULD SEE IF ADJUSTMENTS WOULD BE MADE IN THIS FIRST WEEK. YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT, OUR DATA COLLECTION IS NOT ROBUST. IT WAS WHAT WE COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI WITH THE RESOURCES WE HAD AT TIME AND AT THE TIME AND WE ARE SCHEDULED TO DO MORE ROBUST DATA COLLECTION IN OCTOBER. WE TRIED TO MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS TO APPROVE THE THE INFORMATION. AND HOPEFULLY YOU CAN ANECDOTALLY CONFIRM THIS. THE A.M. PEAK HAS PRETTY MUCH DISSIPATED DURING THE PAN THEM DICK. THIS IS NOT AS MUCH MORNING HOUR. MANY PEOPLE ARE TELECOMMUTING. (NO AUDIO. ) THE MORNING RUSH HOUR IS NOT WHAT IT USED TO BE, ESPECIALLY PREPANDEMIC LEVELS. WE ARE SEEING THE P.M. PEAK HOUR OR THE EVENIN EVENING RUSH HOURT TO PICK UP. IT'S AROUND 75% OF WHAT THEY WERE PREPANDEMIC. SO THERE IS AN IMPACT TO THE EVENING RUSH HOUR. I WILL NOT DENY IT. WE NEVER SAID THERE WAS NEVER GOING TO BE ANY IMPT T TRAFFIC. OUR INTERPRETATION OF THE MANDATE THAT COUNCIL GAVE US WAS TO CREATE BICYCLE FOR SAFE SOCIAL DISTANCING. WE WERE MONITORING TRAFFIC AS PART OF THAT DEPLOYMENT AND WE FEEL THAT WE FAITHFULLY EXECUTED WHAT COUNCIL APPROVED, BUT IF THE TRADEOFF THAT WE'RE SEEING TODA IS UNACCEPTABLE, THEN THAT'S CR COUNCIL'S PREROGATIVEO SCALE THAT BACK TO WHATEVER EXTENT THEY DEEM APPROPRIATE.
03:43:40.878: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES, I APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE. THIS WAS A COUNCIL DIRECTIVE. I DON'T FAULT YOU FOR DOING THIS. YOU ARE DOING WHAT COUNCIL ASKED FOR. AND I WOULD -- WOU LIKE TO FOLLOW UP LATER IF YOU HAVE SOME INFORMATION ON RESPONSE TIMES FOR EMERGENCY VEHICLES. I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT. I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT HAS NOT BEEN DISCUSSED ENOUGH. AND IT SHOULD BE COLLECTED WITH CURRTLY. THAT'S BEING COLLECTED Mayor Taylo COUNCILMEMBER NELSON.
03:44:16.814: >> Councilmember Nelson: THANK YOU. I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS FOR MR. HESS. YOU SAID YOU ANTICIPATE DATA COLLECTION IN NOVEMBER. DO YOU HAVE A TIMELINE OF WHEN YOU MIGHT HAVE DATA?
03:44:27.057: >> TERMSOF WHEN WE WOULD BE READY FOR --
03:44:29.893: >> Councilmember Nelson:  LIKE A MORE SPECIFIC TIMELINE.
03:44:33.564: >> WE ARE TRYING TO COLLECT THE DATA COLLECTION WITH THE D. DA AND WE WANT THEM SYNCHRONIZED -- THE DDA'S DEPLOYMENT WENT OUT ABOUT A WEEK BEFORE THE AREAS OUTSIDE OF THE DDA AND TYPICALLY, IT'S PRETTY STANDARD PRACTICE TO LET THINGS QUOTE/UNQUOTE NORMALIZE BEFORE YOU GO OUT AND DO ANOTHER DATA COLLECTION POINT. THAT'S WHY WE WOULD GIVE IT SEVERAL WEEKS FOR THINGS TO NORMALIZE BEFORE WE WENT OUT. WE ARE HOPING TO DO THE DATA COLLECTION IN THE FIRST OR THE SECOND WEEK OF OCTOBER AND THEN SYNTHESIZE THAT AND PRODUCE THAT IN A REPORT WE COULD SHARE WITH COUNSEL SIX I HAVEN'T COORDINATED A REPORT WITHD AX BUT IF YOU GIVE US A DIRECTIVE IN TERMS OF WHEN YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT BACK, WE CAN SHOOT TO HIT THAT TARGET.
03:45:27.384: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I APPRECIATE THAT. I WILL COMMENT. THAT I'M SOMEWHATONFLICTED. I WAS UNDERWHELMED BUT I'M SOMIC THAT YOU ARE SO EARLY IN THE PROCESS THAT YOU ARE STILL TWEAKING IT AND MAKING CHANGES. I'M THINKING OF POSTPONING TO A DATE THAT IS A LITTLE MORE REALISTIC IN TERMS OF US HAVING SOME FEEDBACK OR GIVING YOU OPPORTUNITIES TO ADJUST IT. THAT AHE IS WHERE MY THINKING -- THAT'S WHERE MY THINKING IS RIGHT NOW. I'M CURIOUS IF WE POSTPONE TO OCTOBER, DO YOU THINK THAT BY THEN YOU MIGHT HAVE SQUEAKED IT FOR HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE DATA? I LIKE I SAID, I BIKE THESE AREAS AND I WAS JUST SORT OF ASTONISHED AT HOW MUCH REAL ESTATE I HAD ALL BY MYSELF? DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? AND THAT'S CONCERNING TO ME BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THAT WE CAN IF WE ARE SAID INDICATING OUR ROADWAYS FOR THE PURPOSE OF SOCIAL DISTAGGING. WE WANT WOM PEOPLE TO BE OCCUPYG THAT SPACE. THAT WOULD BE MY GL. MR. HESS, WHAT DOES OCTOBER 19th -- WHAT DO YOU THINK COULD BE ACHIEVED IN YOU WERE HAVING THIS DISCUSSION AGAIN ON OCTOBER 19th?
03:46:56.039: >> CONNECT DEFINITELY CHUTE FOR THAT TO PROVIDE YOU INFORMATION. I THINK WE CAN DEFINITELY HAVE A DISCUSSION WITH THE EMERGENCY RESPONDERS BY THEM IN TERMS OF IF THEY ARE SEEING ANY DELAYS AS A RESULT OF EMERGENCY RESPONSE. WE HAVE A CALL INTO THE AAATA TO SEE IF THEIR SCHEDULE OR ON TIME PERFORMANCE HAS OCCURRED ALONG THESE CORRIDORS. -- HAS SUFFERED ALONG THESE CORRIDORS. I CAN'T PROMISE THAT WE WILL HAVE EVERYTHING, BUT WE WILL DEFINITELY SHARE WHAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE, AND THEN THE COUNTERS THAT WE CONTROL, WE CAN TRY TO SET THOSE IN EARLY OCTOBER SO THEN THAT WAY PRESENTING THEM BY OCTOBER 19th SEEMS REASONABLE TO YOU.
03:47:48.525: >> Councilmember Nelson: OKAY I'M INTERESTED IN HEARING WHAT OTHERSAVE TO TAKE.
03:47:53.263: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
03:47:55.499: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANKS. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI FOR BRINGING THIS FOR THE. IT TAKES A LOT TO BRING THIS FORWARD. I ADMIRE THAT KIND O COURAGE. THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI. I DID NOT SUPPORT THE HEALTHY STREET PILOTS IN JULY. WHEN THEY PASSED I FIGURED WE WOULD WAIT TO SEE WHAT WAPPED AND THEN RE -- WHAT HAPPENED AND THEN REVIEW. IT'S TIME TO MAKE A MIDCOURSE ADJUSTMENT. IT UP WINDS THE HEALTHY STREET PILOT OUTSIDE OF DOWNTOWN WHERE THERE'S A GOOD BIT OF NEGATIVE FEEDBACK ON PLATT AND SOUTH MAIN. IT WOULD CONSIDER AT THE OTHER OUTSIDE DNTN LOCATION AS AND ALL THE DOWNTOWN LOCATIONS I THINK THAT'S A VERY REASONABLE ARAPPROACH:  TO BE HONEST, THE VAST AMOUNT OF FEEDBACK HAS BEEN NEGATIVE. I THINK ALL THE BARRICADES AND BARRELS ARE UNATTRACTIVE AND CREATE A LOT OF CONFUSION IN MANY LOCIONS THEY ARE NOT USED BY A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF PEDESTRIANS AND CYCLISTS. I WILL OKAY ON THE WHOLE DATA COLLECTION WE WILL DO MORE DATA COLLECTION IN OCTOBER. IF THIS IS TO INFORM -- I APPRECIATE THAT I'M NOT CONVINCED THAT IS NOT A PILOT TO BE DONE PERMANENTLY. I WILL JUST SAY IS. IF IT'S FOR ANY TYPE OF PERMANENT COUNCIL WILL NEAT NORMAL ADT NUMBERS AVERAGE DAILY TRIPS DURING NORMAL TIM FOR VEHICLES, PEDESTRIANS AND BICYCLISTS OR ON THIS ROUTE. TO COLLECT DATA RIGHT NOW AND TO TAKE COUNTS DURING THE PANDEMIC, I THINK THAT DATA IS MEANINGLESS. I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY UTTERLY MEANINGLESS. IT'S NOT TYPICAL. AND I THINK MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS BASED ON THAT DATA IS NOT GOING TO BE INFORMATIVE IN THE WAYS THAT WE -- THAT YOU NEED TO -- THAT MIRRORS, YOU KNOW, NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES. I ALSO HEARD THE LACK OFIGNAGE COMPOUNDS THE CONFUSION AND LEADS TO UNSAFE CONDITIONS AND IF THIS DIVERTS THE TRAFFIC FLOW AS THE VEHICLES FIND ALTERNATE ROUTES. WE HAVE SEEN THAT UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE PLAY OUT TYPICALLY WITH ROADS UNDER CONSTRUCTION, VEHICLES FIND ANOTHER ROUTE AND OFTEN BE IT'S THROUGH A NEIGHBORHOOD AND THAT'S WHERE WE'RE GETTING REPORTS FROM RESIDENTS THAT THAT'S HAPPENING HERE. THEY ARE SEEING MORE TRAFFIC ON THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR ALTERNATE ROUTES. AT THE SAME TIME, I DO UNDERSTAND STAFF'S ARGUMENT THAT PILOTS SHOULD BE CONTINUED SO THE COMPLETE DATA CAN BE COLLECTED AND ANALYZED.
03:51:26.109: >> Mayor Taylor: WE ARE AT 3:30.
03:51:28.111: >> Councilmber Lumm: I WILL WRAP UP. THAT THIS DATA -- AND I WILL ONLY TALK ONCE. THAT THIS DATA SHOULD BE CONTEXTUALIZED BECAUSE IT'S NOT COLLECTED AT A NORMAL TIME. THE -- I SEE THE RESOLUTION IS A COMPROMISE, AND A REASONABLE WAY FORWARD. IT CONTINUES THE LARGE MAJITY OF HEALTHY STREET PILOTS BUT ELIMINATES THE THREE THAT HAVE PROVEN TO BE VERY PROBLEMATIC AND THAT MAKES SENSE TO ME. AND I THINK PILOTS ARE PILOTS FOR A REASON. SOME WORK OUT WELL. SOME NEED ADJUSTMENTS AND OTHERS JUST DON'T WORK. SO THANK YOU AGAIN, COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI FOR YOUR COURAGE IN BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND I ALSO APPRECIATE YOUR REVISING IT TO WHAT WE ARE CONSIDING TONIGHT WHICH I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT. THANKS.
03:52:15.358: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
03:52:16.460: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANKS, MR. MAYOR. SOME OF WHAT I WAS GOING TO SPEAK TO HAS BEEN ASKED ALREADY. I GUESS I'M WILLING TO LET WHAT I THINK IS SOMEWHAT ILL CONCEIVED OR ILL EXECUTED PLAN TO PLAY OUT FOR THE NOTION OF DATA COLLECTION, BUT I GUESS IT'S NOT CLEAR AND I DON'T KNOW IF IT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IN THE PUBLIC MEETING OR SENT TO ME PRIVATELY OR ALL OF US AFTER THE MEETING BUT WHAT EXACTLY IS THE DATA THAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR DO. WE HAVE CAMERAS UP COUNTING, PEDESTRIANS AND CYCLISTS? I'LE CONCERNED ABOUT -- WELL, NOT LESS CONCERNED. I GUESS I'M EQUALLY CONCERNED WITH THE -- THE WE HAD THE SUGGESTED DELAYS FOR VEHICLE TRAFFIC AND WE SAY, SO IT'S ONLY 3 SECONDS, 8 SECONDS, TWO MINUTES WHATEVER THAT IS. THAT'S ONE TYPE OF DATA SELECTED. ARE -- COLLECTED. ARE THESE BEING USED? DO THEY SERVE A VALUE TO THE COMMUNITY? THE LOCATION, IN THE STYLE THAT THEY ARE? YOU KNOW, CAN WE GET DATA THAT TELLS US THAT PERHAPS IF THIS WAS A MORE PERMANENT FIXTURES WITH BULLARD INSTEAD BARRELS? WE CAN GET THAT TYPE OF DATA OUT OF IT, I'M HAPPY TO LET THE PROJECT GO FORWARD. IF WE CAN'T AND IF IT'S A FEEBLE ATTEMPT AND THEN A SCRAMBLE ON THE BACK END TO PROVE THAT THESE WERE A SUCCESS SOMEHOW, WHICH I SUSPECT IS THE NOTION, THEN YOU KNOW, I WILL JOIN SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES AND JUST PTING AIAMERCIFUL END TO THIS. WHAT TYPE OF DATA ARE WE SEEKING AND LETTING IT GO FORWARD. DO WE GET RESULTS THAT WE WANT OR DO WE JUST LET 'OR RIP, WHICH IS OKAY WITH ME TO. IF THERE'S SOME VALUE IN IT. I HAVE OVERWHELMINGLY RECEIVED, LIKE MANY OF YOU, I SUSPECT, NEGATIVE COMMENTS ON IT AND THAT'S MY GENERAL OBSERVATION OUT IN THE PUBLIC TOO. WHAT IN THE WORLD DID YOU GET US INTO IS WHAT I HEAR A LOT. JUST I'M SURE YOU KNOW THAT ALSO. THANK YOU.
03:54:35.599: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
03:54:41.605: >> Councilmember Eaton: SO I HAVE A QUESTION FOR MR. HESS. THE DATA SELECTION THAT YOU WANT TO DO IN OCTOBER, IF WITH EXTENDED THIS VERIDIAN SOLUTION, IT CURRENTLY CALLS FOR ENDING THIS PROJECT BY OCTOBER 2nd. IF WE EXTENDED THAT TO THE 16th, WOULD THAT GIVE YOU SUFFICIENT TIME TO COLLECT DATA THAT YOU INTEND TO COLLECT?
03:55:10.967: >> YES, I BELIEVE WE CAN PROBABLY MEET -- [ NO AULDIO ] ]
03:55:18.041: >> Mayor Taylor: COULD YOU REPEAT THAT?
03:55:19.409: >> SORRY ALL OF YOU FROZE. SO I ASSUME I DID AS WELL. MY APOLOGIES. YES NO, I BELIEVE OCTOBE OCTOBER 16th, IF THAT'S UNCIL'S DESI TO REPORT BACK TO YOU ON, YOU KNOW, DATE, WE CAN START THE DATA COLLECTION IN EARLY OCTOBER. THAT WAS ALWAYS OUR POP HOPE TOO THAT ANYWAY. AND WE CAN S SYNTHESIZE THAT INFORMATION AND GET IT BACK TO YOU.
03:55:45.969: >> Councilmember Eaton: LET ME ASK YOU DIFFERENTLY. WHEN COULD YOU COLLECT THE DA?
03:56:04.154: >> I THINK THERE'S A COORDINATION ISSUE. I THINK THEY HAVE A SUBCONSULTANT WHO IS DOING COUNTS ON THE CORRIDOR AND WE NE TO COORDINAT THAT WITH THEM. I THINK A WEEK OR TWO TO JUST DO THAT LEVEL OF COULD NATION AND GET THE COUNTERS OUT IN THE FIELD FEELS REASONABLE TO ME. WE ARE APPROACHING THE END OF SEPTEMBER AND I THINK A WEEK FROM NOW, WE COULD HOPEFULLY HAVE EVERYTHING LINED UP SO THAT THE COUNTS COULD OCCUR IN THAT FIRST WEEK OF OCTOBER. THAT COULDE POSSIBILITY.
03:56:41.124: >> Councilmember Eaton: BASED ON THAT INFORMATION, I WOULD MOVE TO AMEND THE RESOLVE CLAUSE TO OCTOBER 9th, AND THAT WOULD GIVE THEM ENOUGH TIME TO COLLECT THE DATA THAT WE WANT TO COLLECT.
03:56:53.503: >> IF I COULD JUMP IN, I THINK YMD MAY HAVE BEEN LITTLE OPTIMISTIC AND NOT ALLOWED HIMSELF A WEEK FOR CONSULTANT OR EQUIPMENT ISSUES. I FEEL WE SHOULD BE PUSHING A WEEK FURTHER OUT IF COUNCIL WOULD CONSIDER THAT.
03:57:19.562: >> Councilmember Eaton: YOU ARE SUGGESTING OCTOBER 16th?
03:57:23.400: >> YES.
03:57:23.666: >> Councilmember Eaton: I WOULD MOVE OCTOBER 2nd TO OCTOBER 16th?
03:57:27.871: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE A SECOND? SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER SMITH. IS THAT FRIENDLY TO THE BODY.
03:57:33.476: >> NO.
03:57:33.710: >> Mayor Taylor: ALL RIGHT. COUNCILMEMBER EATON, YOU STILL HAVE THE FLOOR. SO I SUPPORTED THIS EXPERIMENT. LIKE COUNCI COUNCILMEMBER NELSOI HAVE BICYCLED ALL OF THESE TEE PARTICULAR ROUTES AND FOUND THEM TO BE HORRIFIC! AND THE FEEDBACK I GET FROM RESIDENTS IS THAT I'M NOT ALONE IN MY ASSESSMENT OF THAT. ON THE OTHER HAN I WAN STAFF TO HAVE CULLLY THE OPPORTUNITY TO COLLECT THE DATA SO THAT THIS EXPERIMENT CAN BE A LEARNING EXPERIENCE, AND NOT JUST LEAVE US ALL ARGUING AMONG OURSELVES WHETHER IT'S GOOD OR NOT. I WILL SUPPORT IT. IT NEEDS REFORM. HER DISCUSSION OF THE AMENDMENT.
03:58:29.032: >> Mayor Taylor: I HAVE GRAND, RAMLAWI AND NELSON. COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
03:58:36.873: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. I JUST DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE ALREADY PAID FOR THIS, AND WE CAN GIVE STAFF AS MUCH TIME AS THEY NEED TO COLLECT THE DATA THEY CAN IN THE MOST RIGOROUS WAY POSSIBLE, WHY WE ARE TRUNCATING THIS. IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE TE SENSE TO ME. IF THE WHOLE POINT OF A PILOT IS TO RIGOROUSLY TEST THE PILOT. WE ARE PAYING FOR SAID INFRASTRUCTURE, WHY WOULDN'T WE GIVE STAFF AS MUCH TIME AS WE NEED. AS MR. HUPY SAID, WE ARE WORKING WITH CONTRACTORS. ONE COULD GET SICK AND HAVE TO DELAY, WHO KNOWS. BUT WE HAVE ALREADY DELAYED THIS PROJECT SO MANY TIMES, AND IT'S IT'S LIKE I'M IN THE TWILIGHT ZONE SOMETIMES THAT WE CAN'T EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE REASON WHY THIS I HAPPENING SO LATE IN THE SEASON IS BECAUSE THE PROJECT WAS DELAYED MULTIPLE TIMES, BUT WE'RE HERE. WE HAVE PUT THE MONEY INTO IT. WE HAVE MADE THE INVESTMENT TO GO TO AND THE -- I DO WANT TO COLLECT THIS IDEA THAT STAFF SOMEHOW BE COOKING THOSE NUMBERS IS REALLY UNFAIR. SO I WANT TO GIVE THEM AS MUCH TIME AS THEY NEED TO DO THIS PROJECT AND SO LET -- I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING THE AMENDMENT OR ANYTHING OTHER THAN CONTINUING THE PROJECT AS IT STANDS.
04:00:10.700: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEER RAMLAW Councilmember Ramlawi:  I WON'T BE SUPPORTING THE AMENDMENT. I AGREE WITH COUNCILMEMBER LUMM. THE DATA HE WILL BE COLLECTING IS NOT UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES. I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE CALLITY AND THE WORTH OF THAT DATA IS WITH ALL DUE RESPECT. IT'S JUST -- FOR THAT REASON AND A FEW OTHERS, I THINK IT'S A CALLITY OF LIFE ISSUE FOR MANY FOLKS WHO DON'T HAVE THE COMFORTS OF WORKING FROM HOME AND RI RIVING NEARBY. LIVING NE. I THINK IT'S PUNITIVE FOR THE WORKING CLASS AND THE WORKING POOR, WHO HAVE TO COME INTO WORK TO SERVEHE FOOD AND DO THE WORK THAT A DRIVING CIVILIZATION REQUIRES AND I THINK THOSE FOLKS ARE FEELING IT THE MOST. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO ARE DRSTRESSED OUT. THIS IS VERY STRESSFUL TIMES FOR MANY PEOPLE. I THINK THIS' A DISCOECT WITH SOME MEMBERS OF THIS BODY AND AVERAGE WORKING STIFF. WHEN YOU ARE WORKING YOUR TAIL OFF AND YOU ARE STUCK IN TRAFFIC, AND YOU ARE LOOKING AROUND AND THERE'S NOT A CYCLIST AROUND, AND MANY TIMES IT'S ON THE SIDEWALK. IT'S THE NON-MOTORIZED PATH ON PACKARD. THAT'S WHERE I SAW BICYCLISTS YESTERDAY. SO YOU THINK, YOU KNOW, THE ROAD TO HELL IS NOT ONLY PAVED WITH GOOD INTENTIONS BUT ALSO WITH ORANGE BARRELS. I THINK IT'S OKAY TO RECOGNIZE TH MISTAS AND SAY, YOU KNOW WHAT, IT'S NOT WORTH IT. CUT YOUR LOSSES AND IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR MANY PEOPLE, MANY WHO ARE THE WORKING CLASS, THE WORKING POOR.
04:02:26.969: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
04:02:29.205: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I THINK WE ARE FORGETTING WHAT THE PURPOSE OF THIS WAS, AND AS IT'S TO IMPROVE THE PEDESTRIAN AND CYCLING DATA. WILL WE BE COLLECTING INFORMATION ON ASHLEY STREET AND THOSE PARALLEL TOACKARD WRE WE HAVE REPORTS OF ADDITIONAL TRAFFIC AND SPEEDING TRAFFIC?
04:02:57.266: >> NO, I DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S CURRENTLY ANTICIPATED. WE HAVE BASELINE DATA FOR THE PILOT PROJECTS BUT SINCE WE DON'T HAVE CORRESPONDING BASE LINE DATA FOR ANY OF THOSE SECONDARY STREETS OR ADJOINING STREETS THERE'S NO WAY TO COMPARE THE BEFORE AND AFTER TO KNOW HOW MUCH IS SPILLOVER OR WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE. SO THERE IS NOT. I BE>> Councilmember Griswold: THAT'S MY TOP PRIORITY. GIVEN THAT WE HAVE CREATED SOME INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE CONNECTOR STREETS, AT THE SAME TIME, WE HAVE MADE IT LESS SAFE ON THESE OTHER STREETS. WHEN YOU LIVE ON A NEIGHBORHOOD STREET, WHEN YOU ARE WALKING AND STREET AND SUDDENLY HAVE YOUT CONNECTOR LEVEL TRAFFIC OPEN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD STREET, THAT'S A REAL PROBLEM AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY NEED TO BE COLLECTING. THAT'S THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF THIS PILOT THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN PROGRAMMED IN AND I HATE TO SAY IT AGAIN AND I LL APOLOGIZE FOR MY TONE. WE HAVE A TRANSPORTATION TEAM THAT DOES NOT HAVE A PROFESSIONAL ENGINEER WITH VISION ZERO EXPERTISE. BASED ON WHAT I HAVE SEEN WE DON'T HAVE AN ENGINEER WITH ANY HUMAN FACTORS EXPERTISE, AND SO HETHY SOU SOUNDING HEALTHY STRET PROJECT THAT'S EXTREMELY DANGEROUS IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS. I LOOKED AT OTHER HEALTHY STREETS AND SLOW STREETS AND I HAVE NEVER SEEN THE TYPE OF CONFIGURATION AND CONFUSION THAT I'M SEEING IN ANN ARBOR AND I WILL JUST GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE. IF YOU ARE COMING DOWN SWIFT STREET, APPROACHING BROADWAY, YOU -- THERE ARE BARRICADES IN THE -- AND BARRELS IN THE RIGHT TURN LANE. SO EVERYONE MUST BE IN THE LEFT TURN LANE. A LOT OF BACKUP, BUT WHAT'S WORSE THAN THAT IS THAT THE CYCLISTS AREN'T IN THE TUR LANE, BUT IF THEY ARE, THEY ARE IN DANGER. YOU HAVE A SIGN ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD THAT SHOWS TWO LANES OF TRAFFIC, A RIGHT TURN LANE AND A LEFT TURN LANE. AND YOU LOOK AT THE PAVEMENT AND YOU HAVE A RIGHT TURN ARROW PAINTED ON THE ROADWAY, BUT YOU HAVE A COUPLE OF BARRELS BUT THERE'S A LOT OF SPACE IN BETWEEN THE BARRELS. SO DO YOU MOVE OVER? DO YOU NOT MOVE OVER? WE -- WE HAVE GOT ENOUGH FEEDBACK ON THIS PROJECT TO REALIZE THAT BEFORE WE ATTEMPT THIS AGAIN, WE HAVE TO CONSIDER THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AND WE HAVE TO ADD SOME ADDITIONAL TEAM.TISE TO OUR TRANSPORTATION
04:06:08.157: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER NELSON?
04:06:09.692: >> Councilmember Nelson:  ARE WE STILL ADJUSTING THE DATE TO OCTOBER 16th?
04:06:13.262: >> Mayor Taylor: WE ARE. THANK YOU FOR THAT REMINDER.
04:06:15.231: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I WILL NOT SUPPORT THIS I WANT TO REVISIT THIS ONCE THE STAFF HAS TWEAKED THE STRATEGS ON THE THOROUGHFARES. WANT TO VALIDATE THE COMPLAINTS. I VISITED THESE LOCATIONS AND IT'S EARLY DAYS. THEY ARE NOT -- I'M JUST NOT SEEING WHAT I WOULD HAVE HOPED TO HAVE SEEN. PUT I WANT TO GIVE THIS TIME TO PLAY OUT. -- BUT I WANT TO GIVE THIS TIME TO PLAY OUT. I WILL NOT SUPPORT THIS AMENDMENT. I WOULD RATHER REVISIT THIS DISCUSSION AND NOT SET AN END DATE RIGHT NOW. THANKS.
04:06:53.402: >> Mayor Taylor: ON THE AMENDMENT, COUNCILMEMBER SMITH.
04:06:59.775: >> Councilmember Smith: I WILL SAVE MY COMMENTS FOR THE MAIN DISCUSSION.
04:07:03.312: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER ON THE AMENDMENT.
04:07:05.114: >> Councilmember Bannister: I'M JT -- I --'M TRYG TO FIGURE -- THIS IS FOR PLATT BROADWAY AND SOUTH MAIN. HOW DID WE PICK THOSE THREE.
04:07:16.926: >> Councilmember Smith: AMENDMEN T.
04:07:18.260: >> Councilmember Bannister: WE HAVE COMPLAINTS ON CHAPIN AND SUNSET.
04:07:22.832: >> Mayor Taylor: CAN I ASK YOU TO BRING THAT COMMENT BACK WHEN THE AMENDMENT IS COMPLETED.
04:07:26.202: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES.
04:07:27.670: >> Mayor Taylor:FURTHER DISCUSSI OF THE AMENDMENT? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE. STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD, AMENDMENT TO OCTOBER 16th.
04:07:36.078: >> Councilmember Griswold: NO.
04:07:42.184: >> Councilmember Lumm: NO.
04:07:42.852: >> Councilmember Grand: NO.

04:08:00.036: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES.
04:08:02.705: >> Councilmember Bannister: NO.
04:08:08.144: >> Clerk Beaudry: MOTION FAILS.
04:08:10.079: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MAIN MOTION. COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
04:08:13.783: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE MAIN MOTION. AND IT REALLY BEING REALLY DISTURBS ME THAT AN INTELLIGENT COMMUNITY LIKE ANN ARBOR IS HAVING A PROJECT WHE WE DON'T LO AT THE UNINTENDED COMMENCES. MOST ALARMING AND EMOTIONAL COMMUNICATIONS THAT I RECEIVED ARE FROM PEOPLE WHO LIVE ON NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS AND THEY HAD ADDITIONAL TRAFFIC AND SPEEDING. 45 MILES PER HOUR DOWN ASHLEY IS NOT ACCEPTABLE AND SOMETHING LIKE THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IMMEDIATELY. WE DON'T NEED ADDITIONAL TIME. IF SOMEONE IS SERIOUSLY INJURED OR KILLED WHILE WE'RE DOING THIS ACADEMIC EXERCISE WE HAVE TO LIVE WITH THAT AND LET ME JUST GIVE YOU A COUPLE OF FACTS. OUREDESTRIA CRASH RATE WENT UP 25% IN 2019. NONE OF THAT WAS DUE TO MY VOTING AGAINST SOME PEDESTRIAN INFRASTRUCTURE BECAUSE NONE TV WITH WOULD HAVE BEEN SCHEDULED IN. THE STATE OF MICHIGAN'S PEDESTRIAN CRASH RATE PEAKED IN 2015. IT HAS BEEN RELATIVELY FLAT SINCE THEN. WE HAVE A MAJOR PROBLEM. AGAIN, WE NEED GREATER EXPERTISE IN TERMS OF ENGINEERING. WE AGREED TO THAT. WE APPROVED IT IN THE BUDGET OVER A YEAR AGO. IT HASN'T HAPPENED AND SO WE CONTINUE TO DO THESE PROJECTS THAT ARE EXTREMELY DANGEUS ARE ILL CONCEIVED AND NOW WE WANT TO COLLECT ADDITIONAL DATA WHEN WE KNOW WE HAVE A PROBLEM.
04:10:09.632: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCIL MEMBER NELSON.
04:10:15.671: >> Councilmember Nelson:  I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE TO AMEND THIS. I GUESS I'M NOT AMENDING DID -- I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE TO POSTPONE THIS TO THE OCTOBE OCTOBER 19th MEETING.
04:10:24.580: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE A SECOND? SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN. CAN I SUGGEST THAT WE ALL HAVE OUR OPINIONS ABOUT THAT AND WE SHOULD JUST GO TO ARE AND VOTE, BUT PERHAPS COUNCILMEMBER NELSON, YOU WISH TO SAY WHY YOU WANT TO DO THIS?
04:10:38.727: >> Councilmember Nelson:  NO, I WANT TO REVISIT THE CONVERSATION SO WE CAN HAVE THE DATA AND DISCUSS IT AND GIVE STAFF TIME TO TWEAK ITND IMPROVE IT HOWEVER THEY THINK THEY CAN MAKE THE BEST OF IT. I SUSPECT THAT OUR CONVERSATION WILL BE SIMILAR ON THE 1st, BUT I -- ON THE 19th, BUT I WANT TO GIVE STAFF ROOM TO MAKE THIS WORK.
04:10:58.280: >> Mayor Taylor: IS THERE ANYONE WHO NEEDS TO SPEAK TO THIS POSTPONEMENT? COUNCILWOMAN GRISWOLD.
04:11:04.787: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WILL WANT TO STATE VERY CARLY THAT WE ARE NOT COLLECTING DATA ON THE NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS THAT WE ARE NEGATIVELY IMPACTING.
04:11:15.030: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE POSTPONEMENT. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
04:11:18.200: >> Councilmember Lumm: JUST ON THAT DATA COLLECTION POINT, WE NEVER DO. I'M NOT JUSTIFYING IT. WHEN FOR EXAMPLE, THE LANE REDUCTION PROPOSAL FOR GREEN ROAD CAME UP, I ASKED IF LOOKING AT IMPACTS FROM EVERYTHING FROM NIXON TO OTHER STREETS AND THE CITY SAID NO, WE WITH RESPECT AND WE DON'T DO THAT. -- WE WEREN'T AND WE DON'T DO THAT. THERE'S NO QUESTION THIS IMPACTS OTHESTRES. WE SAW THAT MOST CLEARLY AND I WAS GUILTY OF LOOKING OTHER ALTERNATE ROUTES WHEN A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF HURON WAS DOWN FOR CONSTRUCTION. THERE I AM TRYING TO GET FROM CITY HALL, THE CCRB TO CITY HALL AND BEYOND. SO IF YOU WENT THROUGH THE OLD FOURTH WARD, IT WAS BUMR T BUMPER IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD ON VARIOUS STREETS AND WE SEE HOW THIS PLAYS OUT. THAT DATA IS CRITICAL. AND AGAIN, THE DATA COLLECTED DURING THE PANDEMIC IS PRETTY MEANINGLESS BECAUSE IT DOESN'T REFLECT NORMAL CONDITIONS AT ALL. AND WE HAVE ALREADY SPENT 110 OUT OF POCKE ON THESE PROGRAMS. AGAIN NOTING THAT IT DOESN'T INCLUDE STAFF COSTS. BRAVO, COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI FOR DOING THIS. BRAVO TO YOUR SPOT ON COMMENTS THAT YOU ARTICULATED EARLIER AND THIS IS IMPACTING -- ALSO WHY I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD POSTPOPE THIS. IT IS IMPACTING A LOT OF OUR ESSENTIAL WORKERS WHO HAVE TO COMMUTE IN AND OUT OF TOWN. AND I RECEIVED AND I'M SURE WE ALL DID, EMAILS FROM PEOPLE EXPRESSING THAT VERY POINT. AND THAT -- THAT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO APPRECIATE. THERE'S SOME FOLKS WHO CAN'T TELECOMMUTE AND THIS HAS IMPIMPACTED THEM SIGNIFICANTLY. THANKS.
04:13:27.429: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE POSTPONEMENT. I HAVE A QUEUE THAT I DON'T WANT TO MESS WITH. COUNCILMEMBER SMITH?
04:13:35.604: >> Councilmember Smith: YES, I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT WE HEAR THIS A LOT ATHI COUNCIL TABLE FROM MULTIPLE COUNCILMEMBERS. YOU KNOW, ALL OF OUR ENGINEERING STAFF KNOWS WHAT IT TAKES TO GET TO ST ZERO FATALITY AND IT'S TO MAKE CARS GO SLOWER. THEY KNOW HOW TO DO THAT. I THINK THE UNQUESTIONABLE THING I HAVE LEARNED IN THE LAST TWO YEARS IS THAT PEOPLE THI THAT YOU CAN DO BOTH HAVE A COMPLETELY CAR-DEPENDENT CULTURE IN WHICH PEOPLE DRIVE AS FAST AS THEY NEED TO, TO GET TO PLACED JUST IN TIME, AND A SAFE HEALTHY, AND PEDESTRIAN ENVIRONMENT. THOSE TWO THINGS CANNOT COEXIST AND I THINK THE PROBLEM IS NOT EXPERTISE AND IT'S POLITICAL. IT'S NOT OKAY TO SAY IT WILL TAKE TWO MINUTES LONGER DURING PEAK HOUR. I WANT TO TAKE MR. HESS, YOU DID A GREAT JOB PUTTING TOGETHER SOME INFORMATION AT THE LAST MINUTE. I APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT YOUR TEAM HAS DONE. 'S BEENERY CHALLENGING, I KNOW, PUT IT'S HIGH QUALITY STUFF. THAT'S WHAT I GOT. THANKS.

IT'S REALLY A MAJOR ACCOMPLISHMENT AND REALLY THANK YOU. YOU ARE WTH YOUR WEIGHT IN GOLD TO SEEK HE THESE FUNDS TO P THIS ELECTION IS -- AS TEAMLESSS AS POSSIBLE UNDER EXTRAORDINARY, DIFFICULT TIMES.
04:16:48.030: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
04:16:49.431: >> Councilmember Lumm: THAT'S EXACTLY WHY I RAISED MY HAND. THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER RAM LAR RAMLAWI. I WAND TO CONGRATULATE AND THANK MS. BEAUDRY AND HER TEAM FOR TAKING THE TIME TO APPLY AND FOR OBVIOUSLY PREPARING A VERY SOLID REQUEST. $417,000 IS A LOT OF MONEY AND JOB GREATLY DONE, MS. BEAUDRY AND YOUR TEAM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOR ACQUIRING THIS GRANT. I KNOW THE MONEY WILL BE PUT TO IMPORTANT AND GOOD USE. SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR GREAT WORK.
04:17:27.769: >> Clerk Beaudry: THANK YOU.
04:17:33.609: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
04:17:35.577: >> Councilmember Hayner:  OH, YEAH, THANKS. I GUESS I WILL FOLLOW ON THAT PRAISE A I S IN YOUR DESCRIPTION OF WHAT IN THE MEMO OF WHAT IT'S GOING TO BE SPENT ON. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE BALLOT DROP BOXES I UNDERSTAND WE HAVE A SATELLITE OFFICE AND THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE BALLOT DROP BOXES AT OTHER LOCATIONS HALL AND SO ON, IS THAT ALLTY PRIOR TO THE ELECTION OR IS THERE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR -- I THINK WE TALKED ABOUT THIS' LITTLE BIT WHEN WE RUN INTO EACH OTHER THE OTHER DAY. I THOUGHT WE WOULD HAVE THE CONCERN OF MAIL-IN BUT NOT HAVE TO GO IN TO VOTE BY HAVING A BALLOT DROP BOX ON THE DAYF VOTING. SO YOU COULD OKAY YOUR ELECTION DAY AND INSTEAD OF GOING INSIDE AND GET COLLECTED BY THE ELECTION WORKERS SO THERE WOULDN'T BE THE CONSTANT SECURITY ISSUE. IS THAT -- IS INCREASING ELECTION DAY ACCESS ALSO PART OF THIS? I'M JUST CURIOUS
04:18:51.420: >> Clerk Beaudry: THIS IS IN ADDITION TO THE SATELLITE OFFICE AND CITY HALL. WE ARE GETTING FIVE IF YOU LIKE POSTAL BOX GRADE, HIGH QUALITY BOXES AND THEY WILL BE STRATEGICALLY PLACED AT CITY OWNED IF  STILLITIES. JUST TO CLARIFY THEY WILL BE PICKED UP UP AT THE ABSENT COUNTER BOARD. WE CANNOT TABULATE ABSENTEE AT THE POLLING PLACES. LOGISTICALLY, WE CAN'T HAVE 53 BOXES ONE AT EVERY POLL ISSUE (APPLAUSE) ABOUT WE WOULD STILL NEED TO COLLECT THEM AND BRING THEMACK TO CITY HALL FOR TABULATION. IT'S THROUGHOUT THE REGIONS OF CITY, THE BEST SIDE, THE SOUTH SIDE AND NORTHEAST SIDE. AND SOUTHWEST. SO DEPENDING ON WHERE RESIDENTS LIVE IF THEY WANT TO COME DOWNTOWN TO CITY HALL, BUT THERE'S A DROP BOX NEARBY TO EACH NEIGHBORHOOD BUT IT WOULD NOT -- AND THEY ARE OPEN UNTIL 8 P.M. ON ELECTION DAY. IN ADDITION TO THAT, ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS WITH THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING WE WERE ABLE TO DO THE NEW ENVELOPES GOING OUT THIS WEEK TO VOTERS WE HAVE OVER 30,000 REQUESTS ALREADY IN. PAID RETURNED.LOPES ARE POSTAGE SO IN ADDITION TO THE DROP BOXES, THOSE VOTERS WHO HAVE REQUESTED BALLOTS EARLY DO HAVE THE OPTION TO JUST DROP IT RIGHT BACK IN THE MAILBOX, AND WE WILL PICK UP THE POSTAGE.
04:20:28.683: >> Mayor Taylor: DO YOU HAVE A SENSE OF WHEN WE WE CAN IDENTIFY THE LOCATION OF THE FIVE PHYSICAL DROP BOXES?
04:20:33.955: >>lerk Beaudry: WE HAVE ADY IDENTIFIED THEM AND PLANS ARE IN PLACE FOR CONCRETE PADS GOING IN. WE HAVE NOT ANNOUNCED THEM ONLY BECAUSE THE BOXES ARE NOT YET HERE IN ANN ARBOR AND NOT YET INSTALLED AND SO WE DON'T WANT TO CONFUSE PEOPLE LOOKING FOR A BOX BEFORE IT'S THERE. SO AS SOON AS THEY ARRIVE AT THE WHEELER CENTER, WE HAVE PUBLIC WORKS READY TO PUT THEM IN MACE AND THEN WE WILL GET A -- PLACE AND THEN WE WILL GET A PRESS RELEASE OUT IS.
04:21:04.486: >> Councilmember Hayner:  IS IT ESSENTIALLY ONE IN EACH WARD?
04:21:09.891: >> Clerk Beaudry: BASICALLY, YES. THEY ARE G GEOGRAPHICALLY LOCAT. THERE'S FIVE OF THEM, IN ADDITION TO THE ONE ON CENTRAL CAMPUS FOR THE UNIVERSITY COMMUNITY.
04:21:27.008: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU. I THINK IT'S -- LET US NEVER TUSH OUR BACK ON GRANT MONIES UNLESS IT'S A HORRIBLE STRICT SG ATTACHEDO IT. I APPRECIATE THE EFFORT THAT WENT INTO THIS.
04:21:42.958: >> Clerk Beaudry: THANK YOU.
04:21:43.992: >> Mayor Taylor: I WOULD LIKE TO ECHO MY COLLEAGUES' THANKS AND HEARTY CONGRATULATIONS AS WELL. OBVIOUSLY WE CARE ABOUT VERY -- A LITTLE MORE THAN GETTING OUT THE VOTE THIS CYCLE.

THIS IS A GARDEN VARIETY ANNEXATION AND IT'S NOW IN THE CITY'S WATER AND SEWER DISTRICT COMPLETING T -- THESEES CONNECTIONS AND BUILDING THE INFRASTRUCTURE -- THE NEEDED WATER AND SEWER INFRASTRUCTURE ALONG GEDDES AND RIVER VIEW. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THESE FOLKS -- I KNOW THESE RESIDENTS HAVE BEEN WAITING A LONG TIME FOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND ANDT'S A GARDEN VARIETY ANNEXATION.
04:23:32.334: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED. IT'S APPROVED. DB-1:00 RESOLUTION TO APPROVE 841 BROADWAY PUD SITE PLAN AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT. 481 BROADWAY, MOVED BY RAM LAWY AND SECONDED BY SMITH. DISCUSSION OF DB-2. COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.
04:23:52.854: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THIS IS THE SECOND TRANSFORMATIVE DEVELOPMENT IN FRONT OF US TONIGHT. AGAIN, THIS BEING A UNIQUE NIGHT IN THAT WAY. THE BROADWAY SITE SITS AT THE BASE OF THE BROADWAY BRIDGE. FOR DECADES THESE 14 ACRES OF LAND WERE THE DIRTIEST AND MOST POLLUTED IN THE COUNTY THIS WAS HOME TO A COAL GASIFICATION PLANT OR ONE OF THE DIRTIEST ENERGY SOURCES ON EARTH WAS BURNED AND DUMPED. NOW THE ROXBURY GROUP AND PARTNERSHIP WITH DTE IS PUTTING FORWARD A VERY DIFFERENT VISION AND PARTNERED WITH THE BROADER COMMUNITY IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND THE CITY IN A POSITIVE WAY. ON THE FIRST SIX ACRES, THEY SEEK TO BUILD A TRULY MEDSE NEIGHBORHOOD, COMPLETE WITH RESIDENTIAL, HOTEL, RIVER FRONT RESTAURANT AND A RIVER WALK CONNECTING TO OUR BROADER PARK SYSTEM. AND THE ARCHITECTURE SITE PLANNING AND BUILDING MATERIALS ARE BETTER THAN 95% OF WHAT WE USUALLY SEE. THE OTHER 8 ACRES ARE EVEN MORE EXCITING, AT LEAST TO ME. THERE IS -- THERE THE COMMUNITY WILL GET A MASSIVE PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE PARK, THAT WILL INCLUDE A LARGE GREEN SPACE, ICE RINK, WADING AREA, KAYAK LAUNCH, MUSIC PAVILION AND PEDESTRIAN BRIDGE TO ARGO POND. FINALLY, THE OTHER PUBLIC BENEFITS ARE NOTEWORTHY AS WELL. TH WILL BE CONTRIBUTING $2 MILLION TO BUILD PUBLIC AFFORDABLE HOUSING ELSEWHERE, AND WILL CONTINUE THE ENVIRONMENTAL CLEANUP WHICH BEGAN IN 2012. SO I WILL BE GLAD TO SUPPORT THIS. AS I SUPPORTED IT IN OTHER READINGS AND THE COUNCIL HAS SEEN TO SUPPORT IT AT OTHER READINGS AS WELL.
04:25:39.861: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
04:25:40.728: >> Councilmember Hayner: YEAH. THANKS, MR. MAYOR. AS YOU MAY HAVE -- I DIDN'T SUPPORT THIS WHEN WE BROUGHT THIS FORWARD BEFORE, BECAUSE I THINK IT'S INAPPROPRIATE TO BUILD IN THE MIDDLE OF THE RIVER. AS WE HEARD FROM A CALLER, THIS FIRST STREET GROUP HAS DONE THEIR OWN MAPPING AND THE POTENTIAL OF THE FLOOD, AND IF YOU COMPARE THEIR WASHTENAW COUNTY ONLY FEMA SAYS THERE'S 1868 OR 1.5% OF THE PROPERTIES IN WASHTENAW COUNTY ARE SUBJECT TO CATASTROPHIC FLOODING. THIS INDEPENDENT SCIENTIFIC GROUP, THIS FIRST STREET GROUP SAYS 4.4%, OR THREE TIMES MORE ARE SUBJEC TO CATASTROPHIC FLOODING. SO IT'S A BIG DIFFERENCE THERE, AND I REMEMBER WHEN -- WELL, I -- I'M NOT QUITE THAT OLD, BUT YOU MAY RECALL WHEN LBJ ANNOUNCED THE WAR ON POVERTY AND THEN WE REALIZED THAT THE STATISTICS FOR POVERTY IN THIS NATION WERE MUCH, MUCH HIGHER THAN THE GOVERNMENT UNDERSTOOD THEM TOEHE AND I BELIEVE THAT'S THE CASE WITH OUR STORMWATER AND CONCERNS FOR FLOODING. AND WE BASICALLY HAVE A WAR ON FLOODING HERE. AND WE HAVE THAT WITH THE A2ZERO PLAN. WE ARE NOT GOING TO WIN THAT WAR BY MIDDLE IN THE MIDST OF THE RIVER. NOW THIS IS THE JOY TO BEHOLD BUT, YOU KNOW, THAT'S THE COMPARISON. WE FOLLOW OUR OWN RULES. WE -- THERE WILL NOT BE A FULL CLEANUP AT THIS SITE. IT WILL BE ONE OF THE DIRTIEST SITES. IT WILL BE CAPPED WITH HOUSING. THIS' FLOODING CONCERNS AND MANY PELE HE SKEN AND PLEADED WITH US TO NOT DESTROY THE NATURAL AREA OF THE SITE LINES AND PUTTING AN 8 STORY HOTEL 20 FEET FROM THE RIVER IS NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING FOR THAT. AND, YOU KNOW, THERE'S STILL MANY PERMITS THAT ARE REQUIRED AND THE FLOODPLAIN PERMITS AND SO ON BY EGLE. NOW, MY NOTES SAY GET ALL OF YOUR PERMITS TO GO AND COME BACK AND ASK THEM, AND I KNOW THAT FEMA HAS ALREADY GIVEN A LETTER OF REINVESTIGATION. THE FACT THAT SOMEBODY SUGGESTS THAT THE CENTER LINE OF THE HURON RIVER SHOULD NOT WHERE THE MAPS ARE FOREVER, BASICALLY THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THIS DEVELOPMENT, I'M NOT SATISFIED THAT THE DRAW, THE LINE ON THE MAP CHANGES THE NATURE OF THIS LOTION. AND I JUST -- YOU KNOW, IT'S AWESOME, BUT THEY SHOULD HAVE -- THEY SHOULD CLEAN IT UP FULLY AND WE SHOULD NOT BE BUILDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE RIVER. WHEN OUR STORMWATER FOLKS TELL US THAT, YOU KNOW, EVERY CUBIC FOOT OF VOLUME THAT SITS IN THIS PONTIA FLOODWAY IS A CUBIC FOOT OF WATER THAT IS DISPLAYS ELSEWHERE, IT SHOULD CONCERN WHEN WE TALK ABOUT -- IT'S TOO MUCH TO GO IN THE MIDDLE THE RIVER. I'M SORRY. I KNOW IT'S INEVITABLE, YOU JUMPED ON IT THE FIRST TIME, BUT I CAN'T SUPPORT I IILL VOTE FOR RESPECTING OUR RIVER AND NATURAL AREAS HERE. THANK YOU.
04:29:09.037: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
04:29:09.904: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I HAVE A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT TAKE. I KNOW THERE ARE SOME ISSUES THAT REMAIN AND PART OF CLEANUP. I DON'T WANT THE PERFECTION TO THE ENEMY OF GOOD HERE. WE HAVE A SITE THAT'S BEEN LONG NEGLECTED. THIS IS OUR BEST CHANCE OF DOING SOMETHING WITH THIS SITE OR WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT NOW FOR ANOTHER GENERATION TO COME. NOT HAVING ANY HOUSING, NOT HAVING ANY ADDITIONAL CLEANUP, NOT HAVING $2 MILLION IN THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUND. NOT HAVING TAX MONEY COMING FROM IT. NOT PUTTING MONEY TOWARDS FIXING THE DAMS TO A HIGHER LEVEL -- LOSE OUT ON A LOT OF THINGS AND I THINK IT WOULD BE UNWISE FOR US TO VOTE THIS DOWN OR NOT ACCEPT WHAT WE HE HERE. WE HAVE A DEVELOPER WHO HAS WORKED WITH THE COMMUNITY EXTENSIVELY, THE COMMUNITY HAS HAD MUCH PRAISE FOR THE WAY THEY HAVE BEEN TREATED IN THIS OCESS. AND SO I JUST -- I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS AND LOOK FORWARD TO THIS SITE BEING ACTIVATED AND FOLKED FOLKS ACTUALLY LIVING THD $2 MILLION GOING INTO THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING TRUST FUND. AND ON TOP OF THAT, I WILL JUST SAY THAT SINCE -- GARY IS NOT HERE. BUT THIS -- THESE BUILDINGS ARE BEING WAIT A MINUTE TO THE 500-YEAR FLOOD PROTECTIONS NOT THE 100. SO CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG. I KNOW STAFF IS HERE, BUT THIS IS BEING BUILT TO 500 YEAR CRITERIA, NOT THE  100 YEAR THAT IS OFTEN USED TO DEVELOP WITH. SO AGAIN, MORE REASON WHY WE SHOULD BE SAYING YES.
04:31:16.431: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.
04:31:18.599: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANKS MR. MAYOR. I PRETTY MUCH CONCUR WITH EVERYTHING COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI HAD TO SAY ELOQUENTLY. I'M EXCITED TO SEE THIS PROJE BACK BEFORE US TONIGHT AND I WILL CERTAINLY BE SUPPORTING IT. I'M ESPECIALLY PLEASED TO SEE THAT THE SITE PLAN PROPOSED SEASON IS VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL TO THE AREA PLAN COUNCIL ENDORSED LAST JULY. APPROVING JUST AN AREA PLAN IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ZONING WAS' CONCERN A YEAR AGO, THAT DEVELOPED INTO THEEVELER'S CREDIT HAS PROVEN TO BE UNFOUNDED. I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO SAY THIS ABOUT A LOT OF DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS RECENTLY, BUT THERE'S MUCH TO LIKE WITH THIS ONE. AND VARIOUS POINTS ABOUT THE POSITIVES HAVE BEEN MADE. IT DOES -- THIS PROJECT DOES RESULT IN A MASSIVE TRANSFORMATION OF A CONTAMINATED, BLIGHTED VACANT SITE AT A VERY VISIBLE LOCATION IN OUR CITY, TO A -- IT'S A GENUINE MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT, AND IT WILL BE A FEATURE LOCATION AND DESTINATION. I'M CERTAIN OF THAT. THE CLEANUP OF THE CONTAMINATION AT THE SITE GOES BEYOND WHAT DTE WAS REQUIREDO DO. THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT TAX ABATEMENT AND BROWNFIELD PLAN FOR THAT PURPOSE, BUT AFTER THE 13-YEAR ABATEMENT PERIOD, AN INCREMENTAL, $2.1 MILLION OF PROPERTY TAXES WILL BE GENERATED AND THAT INCLUDES ABOUT $600,000 TO THE CITY. AGAIN, THE PROJECT IS A GENUINE MIXED USE PROJECT, NOT ONE IN NAME ONLY, WITH ALMOST 100 UNITS OF HOUSING, 148 ROOM HOTEL, 8,000 SQUARE FEET OF RETAIL SPACE. BUT I THINK WHAT REALLY MAKES THIS PROJECT UNIQUE AND SPECIAL IS ITS OPEN SPACE. IT'S FEATURING OF THE RIVER, AND THE CREATION OF RECREATIONAL AMENITIES. THERE ARE SIXIG CONTIGUOUS AREAF OPEN SPACE, ICE RINK, AND NON-MOTORIZED WATERCRAFT LAUNCH AREA AND A POTENTIAL CANOE, KAYAK, RENTAL AREA RUN BY ANN ARBOR PARKS AND RECS. THIS IS NOT WHERE THE AMENITIES ARE EXCLUSIVELY FOR THE USE OF ITS RESIDENTS AND GUESTS BUT WILL BE LARGELY OPEN TO THE PUBLIC. THAT'S VERY EXCITING AND I BELIEVE THIS WILL BECOME A DESTINATION SITE FOR BOTH RESIDENTS AND VISITORS. THE 100 UNITS OF HOUSING ARE NOT AFFORDABLE. HOUSING AS IT HAS BEEN NOTED THIS LIEU OF AFFORDABLE ON-SITE, THEY ARE MAKING A CONTRIBUTION OF OVE2 MILLION TO AT FORDABLE HOUSING FUND. OBVIOUSLY, THAT'S VERY SIGNIFICANT. AND AS WITH ANY DEVELOPMENT OF THIS MAGNITUDE, THERE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT THE ADEQUACY OF ON-SITE PARKING AND TRAFFIC IMPACTS. THE PROJECT INCLUDES THE TOTAL OF ALMOST 500 PARKING SPACES CONTAINED IN A PARKING STRUCTURE AND THE SURFACE LOTS INCLUDING 50 SPACES DEDICATED TO OPEN SPACE AND RECREATION USERS I THINK THAT SHOULD BE ADEQUATE A. IN TERMS OF TRAFFIC SIGNALS, THIS SHOULD BE A NEW TRAFFIC AND THE BRIDGE IT HAS BEEN DETERMINED DOES NOT NEED TO BE STRUCTURALLY CHANGED AND THAT'S VERY GOOD NEWS. THIBLE DECREEMENTAL TRAFFIC WILL RESULT IN VEHICLE TRAFFIC DELAYS THAT AVERAGE ABOUT FIVE SECONDS.
04:34:47.408: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER YOU ARE AT 3:30.
04:34:49.276: >> Councilmember Lumm: I'M FINISHING UP. IT COULD BE AS MUCH AS 45 SECONDS. SO I THINK IN VIEW OF THOSE REASONABLE TRADEOFFS WORTH -- THOSE ARE WORTH MAKING TO REALIZE ALL OF THE BENEFITS OF THIS PROJECT. SO AGAIN, I'M EXCITED TO SEE THIS TONIGHT, AND I WILL BE
04:35:04.025: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER. GRAND.
04:35:10.197: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. I WON'T REPEAT WHAT'S ALREADY BEEN SAID, BUT I JUST WANT TO EXPRESS MY THANKS TO THE GROUP THAT'S BRINGING THIS FORWARD THIS REALLY IS WHAT I HOPE WILL BE A TURNING POINT IN ENABLING US TO HAVE A TRUE WATERFRONT AND HELP US ALSO MAKE IMPVEMENTS ON NORTH MAIN, GET CONNECTIVITY. IT'S SUCH A CRITICAL PIECE, AND MANY, MANY, MANY, YEARS AGO, I SAT ON THE NORTH MAIN TASK FORCE AND THE SUBCOMMITTEE FOR THE DTE SITE AND WE SKETCHED OUT WHAT WE WANTED PUBLIC SPACE TO LOOK LIKE, AS PART OF THAT REPORT, AND IT LOOKS BETTER THAN WE TIME BUT STILL HAVE SOME OF THE CRITICAL ELEMENTS THAT WERE SO IMPORTANT TO THE PARK SYSTEM THEN AND CONTINUE TO BE RELEVANT TODAY. SO I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER THAT THIS IS, YOU KNOW, GOING FORWARD TONIGHT. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO NOT ONLY THESE CHANGES BUT HOW IT WILL REALLY ACTIVATE WHAT HAS BEEN A PROBLEMATIC ENTRANCE TO OUR CITY. SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO HAVING AN EXCITING WATERFRONT IN THE FUTURE.
04:36:25.372: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
04:36:26.240: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES, SINCE THIS IS MY WARD AND I HAVE LIVED WITHIN A MILE OF THIS FOR THE LAST 35 YEARS OR MONTH, I JU WANT TO POINT OUT A COUPLE OF INCONSISTENCIES IN OUR COUNCIL AS A WHOLE AND THE BODY AS A WHOLE. YOU GET TO APPROVE THE 50 OR 100 YEAR BUILDINGS THAT WON'T MEET THE A2ZERO GOALS THAT ARE UPON US, FRANKLY IN THE NEXT FOUR TO -- FOUR TO EIGHT YEARS OR SO. SO WE'RE PTI UPUILDINGS THAT ARE NOT ELECTRIFIED, THAT ARE BURNING GAS, THAT DON'T HAVE ANY OF THE A2ZERO CONSTRUCTION GOALS IN THEM THAT WE ALL AGREED TO. AND WE'RE -- AND BECAUSE THE DEVELOPER AND THIS IS FINE, THEY HAVE CHOSEN TO MAKE A CONTRIBUTION INSTEAD OF BUILDING ACTUAL AFFORDABLE HOUSING ON THE SITE, WE ALSO THEN TREFO ARE CONTINUING TO DELUDE THE PERCENTAGE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN OUR COMMUNITY, DESPITE THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS. AND LASTLY, I WILL JUST SAY THAT THE CONSTANT DRUM BEAT THAT NORTH MAIN IS SOME KIND OF EYE SORE IS A GREAT OFFENSE TO ME, NOT ONLY BECAUSE I HAVE WORKED DOWN IN THAT REGION, BUT BECAUSE, YOU KNO THEITY -- A CITY'S HEALTHY MIX OF ECONOMY IN A CITY IS NOT 90% CONDO OR 70% SINGLE FAMILY ZONING, 30% CONDO. I MEAN, THERE NEEDS TO BE LEGITIMATE FABRICATION, INDUSTRIAL PROCESSES, BUSINESSES, SMALL BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, ALL OF THOSE KINDS OF THINGS AND I KNOW SOME FOLKS ON THIS BODY WOULD JUST WASH ALL THAT NORTH MAIN AWAY, AND BUILD A BUNCH OF 13-STORY CONDOS BUILDING AT THE RIVER. WE HAVE A RIVER FRONT. IT'S A NATURAL RIVER FRONT. SO PUT YOUR EIGHT-STORY HOTEL RIGHT NEXT TO IT AND, YOU KNOW, I'M SURE THAT'S WHAT WE WILL DO, BUT JUST RECOGNIZE THAT WE'RE A LITTLE SCHIZOPHRENIC WHEN IT COMES TO SAYING WHAT WE WANT, WHEN IT COMES TO OUR 52 ZERO 52- A2ZERO GOALS THIS MEETS VERY FEW OF THEM.
04:38:41.542: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
04:38:42.443: >> Councilmember Bannister:  I ALSO WANT TO CONGRATULATEAVE DURIDA BY PLAYING BY THE RULES OF CITY OF ANN ARBOR AND DOING A GREAT JOB WITH IT AND INVOLVING EVERYONE. FOR THE RECORD, THOUGH, WHILE STAFF HAS STAYED UP HERE UNTIL MIDNIGHT, FOR THE PEOPLE WHO OUT IN THE RESIDEN WHO A STI CONCERNED, WOULD STAFF SPEAK TO THE HIGH RISK OF FLOODING THERE IN THE 15 FEET AND THE PROBLEM WITH THE LOCAL DAMS ARGO AND BARTON AND HOW THIS -- AND THE LLION -- SO THE THINGS FOR THE RECORD, HOW THEY WERE ADDRESSED. AND THEN ONE OTHER QUESTION, I UNDERSTAND IN TWO PHASES, IT'S GOING TO BE THE CONDOS AND THE PUBLIC SPACE FIRST, AND THEN SECOND PHASE WILL BE THE HOTEL AND THE COMMERCIAL SPACES AND DO WE KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT WHY THOSE TWO PHASES WERE THAT WAY AND ARE THEY BEING CHANGED AT ALL WITH THE PANDEMIC?
04:39:57.918: >> GOOD EVENING MAYOR AND COUNCIL, BRETT LENART, THE PLANNING MANAGER. I WILL TRY TO TOUCH ON MOST OF THOSE AND THEN I WILL HAVE MATT KOWALSKI SPEAK TO THE PHASING QUESTION. CERTAINLY AS IT RELATES TO THE CONTAMINATION, I THINK AS PREVIOUSLY REFERCED, THE PROPOSED APPROACH TO THIS THE SITE IS TO CLEAN IT UP TO A HIGHER STANDARD THAN WHAT WOULD BE REQUIRED. CURRENTLY, DTE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO CLEAN UP TO AN INDUSTRIAL STANDARD. YOU RECALL STATE'S CRITERIA ARE USE BASED BECAUSE OF THE USES BEING PROPOSED, THE DEVELOPMENT TEAM WILL BE CLEANING THAT UP TO A HIGHER STANDARD TO MEET THE HIGHER STANDARD REQUIREMENTS. AST RELATES NOT FLOODPLAIN, AND PROMPT E POSED PROJECT, NOT ONLY MEETS OUR CURRENT ORDINANCES BUT IT DOES AS WITH REFERENCED MEET THE PROPOSED .2% OF FLOOD RISK APPROACH, WHICH IS PART OF A SET OF PROPOSED FLOODPLAIN ORDINANCES, CHANGES THAT WOULD ADD ADDITIONAL STANDARDS THAT WE HOPE TO BE PRESENTING TYO TODAY SETIME LATER THI YEAR. SO THIS PROJECT IS OUT IN FRONT OF MEETING THAT REQUIREMENT, AND THEN AS IT RELATES TO THE DAM STABILITY, IN ADDITION TO THE ACTUAL FINANCIAL SUPPORT THAT THIS PROJECT WILL BE PROVIDING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE RESREQUIRERESOURCES, THEY PERFON ANALYSIS THAT ACTUAL LITTLE CONSIDERS WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN THAT SORT OF SIGNIFICANT EVENT TO MAKE SURE -- AND THAT ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT THEY WOULD ACTUALLY HAVE ADEQUATE TIME TO EVALUATE THE SITE, EVEN IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT THAT THAT OCCURRED. SO FOR ALL OF THOSE REASONS, THE DEVELOPING IT TO A HIGHER STANDARD THAN OUR WORK CAN'TLY Y REQUIRED, IT'S THOUGHTFUL PLANNING FROM A SITE OPERATION PERSPECTIVE AND, OF COURSE, THE ONGOINGIBLE VESTMENT AND RESOURCES -- ONGOING INVESTMENTS ARE MAINTAINED, I THINK THEY ARE APPROPRIATE CONSIDERATIONS FOR OUR STAFF RECOMMENDATIONS. AND THEN I WILL GENERALLY SAY TO MY KNOWLEDGE, I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THERE'S BEEN ANY PROPOSED CHANGES TO THE PHASING, BUT I LEAVE THAT TO CITY PLANNER KOWALSKI IF HE HAS ANYTHING TO ADD TO THAT.
04:42:23.931: >> GOOD EVENING, EVERYBODY. AS TO THE PHASING QUESTION, I WOULD SAY THE CAUCUS RESPONSE, IT WAS GENERALLY ASSUMED THAT THAT CONSTRUCTION PHASING PLAN AND THE TIME LIMIT FOR THAT WAS TAKEN FROM THE APPROVED SITE PLAN IS WHAT THEY ARE REQUIRED TO LIST ON THERE, AS FAR AS THE TIME TO COMPLETE DIFFERENT PHASES AND THINGS LIKE THAT. AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S BEEN A DELAY IN THAT, I GUESS I WOULD PROBABLY -- I KNOW T DEVELOPER IS IN THE AUDIENCE RIGHT NOW, AND HE MAY BE ABLE TO SPEAK TO AS FAR AS WHAT -- IF THERE IS A DELAY IN THE PHASING PLAN. WE HAVE IT IDENTIFIED AGAIN ON THE SITE PLAN OF WHAT GOES IN AT WHAT TIME, BUT AS FAR AS THE ACTUAL TIMING OF THAT, I WOULD LIKE PROBABLY IF WE COULD SPEAK TO THE DEVELOPER IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO KNOW A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL. I HOPE THAT ANSWERED AT LEAST MY END OF IT.
04:43:16.283: >> Councilmember Bannister:  I HAVE THINK A COUPLE OF RESIDENTS WHO ASKED ABOUT THAT, IF THERE'S ANY FURTHER DETAIL ABOUT THE PHASING.
04:43:24.791: >> Mayor Taylor: MS. BEAUDRY IF YOU COULDMENT PLEAT.
04:43:28.362: >> I KNOW MR. DURYDA IS OPEN THE PHONE.
04:43:36.737: >> Clerk Beaudry: HE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SPEAK NOW.
04:43:39.173: >> HELLO. I'M HOPING YOU CAN HEAR ME.
04:43:41.608: >> Mayor Taylor: WE CAN, THANK YOU.
04:43:43.210: >> WOUNDFUL IT'S GOOD TO SEE EVERYBODY. HEALTHY AND SAFE. TO ANSWER THE QUESTION, I COULDN'T HAVE REALLY DONE A BETTER JOB THAN BRETT AND MATT JUST DID. YOU II CAN'T GIVE A WHOLE LOT ME COLOR, COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER ON THE IMPACT OF THE CURRENT PANDEMIC, I WOULD SAY THE PROCESS OF GETTING TO WHERE WE ARE TODAY HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT ATTENUAATTENUATED BY THE PANDEM. OUR GOALS FOR TEVELOPMENT OF THE SITE HAVE NOT CHANGED AND THE PHASING IS APPROPRIATE OR MORE APPROPRIATE THAN EVER. WE CERTAINLY STILL INTEND TO START WITH THE TWO COMPONENTS IN PHASE ONE, WHICH IS RESIDENTIAL AND PUBLIC SPACE AND HOSPITALITY WOULD BE -- THE HOSPITALITY AND THE RETAIL IS STILLONCEEDF AS THE SECOND PHASE. OUR HOPE, PARTICULARLY IF WE ARE HONORED WITH YOUR APPROVAL THIS EVENING ARE TO MOVE AS DILIGENTLY AS POSSIBLE TO GET WORK UNDERWAY ON THIS SITE IN THE SPRING OF NEXT YEAR. AND THEN THAT TIME FRAME THAT YOU HAVE SEEN PREVIOUSLY, REALLY STARTS FROM THAT POINT FORWARD. SO WE'RE -- WE'RE CANDIDLY SIX TO EIGHT MONTHS BEHIND WHERE WE ARE WANTED TO BE RIGHT NOW, BUT THAT'S JUST THE NATURE OF THE COMCOMPLEX PROJECTS LIKE. THIS.
04:45:13.834: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. FURTHER DISCUSSION? I WILL SAY FOR MY PART, I'M DELIGHTED THIS IS MOVING FORWARD. I WILL JUST SAY -- IT WILL TURN BLIGHT INTO SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL. I THINK THE OPEN SPACE IS GOING TO BE ATTRACTIVE AND USED. I THINK THE COMMERCIAL ARE LL BE WILL BE A BOONE. I THINK AT THE END, YOU KNOW, WE ARE GOING TO BE THE BENEFICIARY FINALFINALLY -- -- BENEFICIARIEA TRANSFOMED WATERFRONT. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK DTE AS THE OWNER AND THE DEVELOPER AS THE DEVELOPER, FOR PUTTING FORWARD A PROJECT THAT I THINK IS GOING TO -- I THINK IT WILL MAKE US ALL PROUD. SO THANK YOU.
04:46:07.821: >> THANK YOU.

I WANT TO THANK COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI FOR QUOTING KARL MARX ABOUT THE ROAD TO HELL AND I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE ROAD TO GOOD INTENTIONS. I WANT TO MENTION BRILY TT COUNCIL MEMBER LUMM HAS ABSOLUTELY NO BUSINESS SPEAKING TO COURAGE LIKE SHE TRIED TO DO WHEN SHE WAS TRYING TO HELP THE TREATS INITIATIVE. FIGHTING THIS TYPE OF ACTION IS ABSOLUTE ARSON. IT'S TERRIBLE. SO IF YOU ARE TALKING TO PEOPLE THAT ARE SAYING THEY NEED MORE SPACE FOR CARS, YOU NEED TO TALK TO MORE PEOPLE. MY IT STATE RIGHT NOW IN CALIFORNIA IS ABSOLUTELY ON Y'AL HAVE SEENHE SMOKE. I'M SURE SOME OF YOU WILL HAVE RETWEETED THE PICTURES ABOUT HOW NICE THE SUNSETS WERE. I PROMISE IT'S TERRIFYING ON THIS END AND IT WILL NOT BE CONTAINED UNTIL WE HAVE SOME DRASTIC ACTION NATIONWIDE. I WANT TO SAY THAT MANY -- I WANT TO BRING SOME FIRE OF MY OWN RIGHT HERE AND IT'S ABOUT TO GET PRETTY REAL. IT'S ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAT -- AND HAVING THEIR CHILDREN LOCKED IN CAGES. ANN ARBOR IS ONE OF THE FEW PLACES WHERE MANY PEOPLE SAUCE THE FASCIST WRITING IN THE WALL AND IN 2017, Y'ALL VOTED TO -- 8-1 TO MAKE ANN ARBOR A SANCTUARY CITY. THE LONE VOTE WAS COUNCILMEMBER LUMM. SHE WDERED WHE DO WE GO FROM HERE. I WILL SAY THIS. WE WILL GO TO SHOUT THIS AS LOUD AND PROUD AS WE ABSOLUTELY K. WE NEED TO LET VOTERS KNOW THE IMPORTANCE OF LOCAL POLITICAL INVOLVEMENT. OTHER CITIES ACTIVELY ORDERED THEIR POLICE TO COOPERATE WITH ICE. WE HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING HOW MANY SUPER APPORTIONS WERE FORCES ON TERRIFIED IMMIGRANTS. WE ALSO ABSOLUTELY KNOW THAT LATINO CITIZENS, SIFT CITIZENS HAVE BEEN DETAINED BY ICE, EVEN A VETERAN IN GRAND RAPIDS WHO WAS HANDED OVER BY A GRPD CAPTAIN. AND COUNCILMEMBER JEFF HAYNER, YOU SPOKE DURING PUBLIC COMMENT. YOU MADE AN UNFUNNY JOKE ABOUT IT BEING VIRTUAL SIGNALING WHICH IS A VERY OFTEN USED PHRASE TO SHOVE RACISM UNDER THE RUG. I DON'T THINK YOU INTENDED TO DO THAT BUT YOU ABSOLUTELY DID UNINTENTIONALLY. LUMM AND HAYNER, YOU NEED TO BE THANKING THE PREVIOUS COUNCIL AS I AM RIGHT NOW. THESE -- THESE MEMBERS ARE TELLING ICE AND TRUMP AND RACISM TO TAKE A HIKE.
04:51:11.691: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
04:51:13.026: >> FUTURES AND THEY SAVING DIGNITY. WE HAVE TO BRING MORE PEOPLE INTO THE LOCAL POLITICS. THEY NEED TO KNOW THAT THESE ARE IMPORTANT. AND H Y'ALL ARE SHOUTING WAY BETTER. ISRAEL SOUNDING  SOUND- YOU AREG WAY BETTER ON HOUSING THAN YOU DID BACK IN JUNE. THAT'S NOT JUST CONTAINED INSIDE OF ANN ARBOR. WE NEED TO END SEGREGATION AND THE LAST LITTLE BIT, PLEASE CONTACT IN CONSENT WITH THE SIGHT TO SEE, AROUND THE SAME TIME THE MUSHROOMS -- DECRIMINALIZING THEM WILL DECREASE STRUCTURAL RACISM.

04:52:17.957: >> HELLO. THIS IS ZACHARY STORY. WARD 5 RESIDENT ANN ARBOR. I REALLY WOULD LIKE TO THANK GEO AS UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN FOR THR STRIKE AND ALSO THE RESIDENT STAFF WHO I BELIEVE ARE STILL ON STRIKE AND WHILE THEY ARE NEGOTIATING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION, AND DIAMOND STAFF AS WELL. THEY HAVE TAKEN A STAND AGAINST EI T UNIVERSITY, AND THEIR TERRIBLE REOPENING PLANS HAS PUT THE WHOLE COMMUNITY AT RISK DURING THIS PANDEMIC. AND SO I REALLY APPLAUD THE BRAVERY AND THE COMMITMENT TO THE STRIKE. IT KIND OF REALLY OPENED MY EYES TO UGLIER SIDE OF UNIVERSITY AND IF PRESIDENT SCHLISSEL AND THE REGENTS PRIORIZE THE MONEY OVER THE LIVES OF OUR COMMUNITY, YOU KNOW THAT REALLY HAS ENRAGED ME AND BROUGHT UP A LOT OF SADNESS AND, YOU KNOW, WEAW THE FACULTY HAVE A NO CONFIDENCE VOTE IN THE ADMINISTRATION, AND AS WE ALL ARE ALL NERVOUS ABOUT THE ELECTION IN NOVEMBER AND REALLY DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PREPARE FOR THAT, AND TO -- TO ENCOURAGE OTHERS TO VOTE AND ALL OF THAT AGAINST A PRESIDENT WHO HAS GOTTEN MORE AND MORE AUTHORITARIAN, AND TO SEE SUCH STRONG AUTHORITARIANISM AND THREATINGHE UNION WITH LEGAL ACTION AND EVERYTHING FROM THE PRESIDENT, IT'S -- IT'S VERY SAD TO SEE THAT SEVERE AUTHORITARIANISM COME OUT.
04:55:02.222: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
04:55:03.523: >> FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, AS WELL AS SEE ALL OF THESE HORRENDOUS THINGS TRUMP HAS BEEN DOING THAT WE ALL KNOW ABOUT SO CLEARLY. SO -- SO THE FIGHT IS NOT OVER AND I KNOW WE CAN COME TOGETHER AND GET THE UNIVERSITY TO CLEAN UP. ANK YOU. BYE.
04:55:42.161: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
04:55:53.606: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER 684. CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING 684. GO AHEAD.
04:56:02.916: >> YES, HI, THIS IS ERIC STURGIS, I'M FROM ANN ARBOR. I WON'T CALL INTO THE OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA, CITY COUNCIL MEETING. I'M MORE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING IN ANN ARBOR, MICHIGAN. THANK YOU TO COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER FOR HER WORK ON DC-2. I WAS A LITTLE DISHEARTENED THAT UP WITH OF THE COUNCILMEMBERS WHO PROCEEDED TO THANK EVERYBODY BUT COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER FOR HER WORK ON THAT. THAT DOESN'T HELP WITH THE ICTION ON COUNCIL. I HOPE THAT COUNCILMEMBER WILL THANK HER IN THE COUNCIL COMMENTS. NUMBER TWO, THANK YOU TO COUNCILMEMBER LUMM FOR PUTTING OUT THE RESOLUTION FOR CITIZEN AND TAXPAYER INPUT ON THE BUDGET. I THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT. I FOUND IT INTERESTING THAT PEOPLE WHO WTED THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR SEARCH TO CONTINUE TO GET MORE PUBLIC INPUT, THOUGH THEY GOT THE SAME RESULT WERE AGAINST GIVING PUBLIC INPUT ON OUR TAX DOLLARS BEING USED FOR THE BUDGET. I FOUND THAT TO BE QUITE CONTRADICTORY. I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT REMEMBER COUNCILMEMBERS COUNTY, AND A2ZERO, THE ORIGINAL PROPOSAL, HOW MANY PEOPLE CALLED IN SUPPORTING IT. AND SAYING HOW GREAT IT WAS AND POINTING THAT OUT. BUT I'M UNDERSTANDING THAT MORE PEOPLE CALLED IN AND EMAILED OPPOSING HEALTHY STREETS BUT NOW SUDDENLY THAT DOESN'T MATTER. SO NOW I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT I SEE THAT PEOE USE DATA FOR THEIR OWN LIKING AND I WAS HOPING THAT COUNCIL WOULD ACT CONSISTENTLY IN THE FUTURE, AND WHEN THEY USED DATA, BUT I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO THINK COUNCILMEMBER NELSON. SHE GOT ONE VOTE WRONG, BUT SHE DID GET THE U OF M RESOLUTION, I THOUGHT THAT WAS GREAT AND I THINK IT'S GREAT TO BRING U OF M TO THE TABLE. AND I WOULD HOPE THAT WITH THE GEO STRIKE, I NOTICE THAT SOME CURRENT PEOPLE WOULD WORK THERE DID NOT SIGN ON TO SUPPORT THEM. BUT THEY WILL BE ON COUNCIL COMING UP. SO I'M WONDERING WERE THEY ABLE TO SUPPORT THE GEO OR THEIR EMPLOYER. SO I'M JUST -- JUST, YOU KNOW --
04:58:35.768: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
04:58:37.203: >> FEEDBACK FROM THE OUTSIDE. I APPRECIATE YOU GUYS STAYING UP THIS LATE AND YOU GUYS HAVE AWE GREAT NIGHT. -- A GREAT NIGHT.
04:58:43.476: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU
04:58:50.650: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING IN 828. CALLER 828, DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT?
04:59:08.601: >> CAN YOU HEAR ME?
04:59:09.769: >> Clerk Beaudry: GO AHEAD.
04:59:10.970: >> MM-HMM. MY NAME IS CAT KATHY TRACKEN. I REALLY APPRECIATE ALI RAMLAWI BRINGING THE RESOLUTION ABOUT THE HEALTHY STREETS. I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT THAT DID NOT PASS. I THINK YOU HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD. IT IS A HUGE IMPACT IN QUALITY OF LIFE. I REALLY WAS HOPING -- I'M SPECIFICALLY TALKING ABOUT SOUTH MAIN STREET. AND I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT COUNCILMEMBER NELSON, THAT YOU CHANGED YOUR VOTE FROM WHAT YOU TOLD MY DAUGHTER YOU WERE GOING TO DO WHEN SHE EMAILED YOU ABOUT SOUTH MAIN STREET. I JUST THINK THAT IT'S SUCH A TRAFFIC CONGESTION. I HAD EMAILED ALL OF YOU A WHILE AGO ABOUT MY TRAVELS LAST WEEKEND AND IT'S NOT BEEN A LOT DIFFERENT OVER THE LAST WEEK, BUT THE OTHER THING I WANTED TO KNOW IS THAT REGARDING HEALTHY STREETS IS THE STREETS LIKE SUNSET AND CHAPIN AND ALL OF THOSE THAT GOT PUT IN JULY JULY 8th, 9th OR 10th, SOMETHING LIKE THAT. NEXT WEEK -- OR LIKE THE 8th, 9th OR 10th OF OCTOBER, THOSE STREETS SHOULD -- THEIR PILOT TIME SHOULD BE UP AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN RETURN THOSE TO REGULAR STREETS. I'M -- I KNOW I SOUND LIKE A BROKEN RECORD, BUT CHAPIN IS THE MAIN WAY TO CONNECT FROM MILLER TO HURON, ESPECIALL WITH ALL OF THE CONSTRUCTION ON FIRST AND ASHLEY BEING A ONE WAY, AND MAIN STREET BEING CLOSED ON THE WEEKENDS. AND IT'S AN IMPORTANT CONNECTOR. THERE ARE SIDEWALKS ON EACH SIDE AND, YES, THE SIDEWALKS ARE NARROW, BUT AS I SAID AT COUNCIL CAUCUS, EX EXCUSE ME ON SUNDAY,F YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WALKING ON THE STREETS WHEN THE MAIN STREETS AND LIBERTY AND THOSE STREETS ARE CLOSED FOR THE RESTAURANTS, THERE IS A LOT OF CONJCONGESTION IS THERE AND THEU HAVE TWO PEOPLE PASSING ON THE SIDEWALK AND THEY FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE TO BE 10 FEET FROM ANOTHER PERSON AND THE CDC DOES NOT THINK THAT PASSING BY SOMEONE WITH THE MASK ON IS A HIGHISK FOR GETTING COVID. IT'S BEING CLOSE CONTACT FOR PROLONGED PERIOD OF TIME AS IN MORE THAN 15 MINUTES AND THEN IN A ENCLOSED SPACE. I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN AT LEAST GET THESE RESIDENTIAL STREETS OPENED UP AGAIN AND WHEN YOU DO A PROJECT LIKE THAT. CTOR.
05:01:41.020: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
05:01:41.654: >> A MAILING THAT WENT OUT REGARDING BURNING AND THINGS. ALTHOUGH ONLY THE PEOPLE ON SUNSET WERE ABLE TO VOTE ABOUT THAT STREET, I LIVE OPEN ORKNEY AND IT IMPACTED ME DIRECTLY, BUT I HAD NO SAY. I WOULD APPRECIATE MORE COMMUNICATION BEFORE THESE TYPES OFROGRAMS ARE ENACTED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
05:02:06.012: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. CLERK CALLER 677.
05:02:19.892: >> HI, THIS IS MICHELLE HUGHES AND I'M -- I'M KIN OF DISAPPOINTED THAT THE POLICE CONTRACT PASSED TODAY UNANIMOUSLY WITH NO DISCUSSION I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE HEARD FROM THE POLICE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION. IDEALLY WE WOULD HAVE HAD TIME FOR THEM TO MEET, SEE THE ACTUAL PROPOSED CONTRACT AND PREPARE AN OFFICIAL STATEMENT AND VOTE OPEN IT. INSTEAD WE DIDN'T HEAR AT ALL FROM THEM TONIGHT. YOU KNOW, WE COULD HAVE AT LEAST GIVEN THEM TIME AT THE BEGINNING OF THE MEETING LIKE WE DO AT THE BEGINNING OF EVERY MEETING AT THE TOP OF THE MONTH. I KNOW THEY WERE AT THE LAST MEETING BUT THEY DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO LOOK AT THE CONTRACT BEFORE THAT. AND THEY WERE LEARNING ABOUT THE CONTRACT AT THE SAME TIME WE WERE. SO THAT'S, YOU KNOW, NOT A WHOLE LOT OF TIME TO DIGEST STUFF. THEY JUST SAW THE SAME PRESENTATION THAT THE PUBLIC SAW. HOPEFULLY NT TIME WE HAVE A ROUND OF NEGOTIATIONS ABOUT THE POLICE CONTRACT, THE POLICE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION WILL BE INVOLVED EARLY ON IN THE PROCESS, AND WE'LL HEAR WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY BEFORE, YOU KNOW, -- BEFORE THE CITY COUNCIL VOTES ON IT. THANK YOU. BYE.
05:04:04.296: >> Clerk Beaudry: MAYOR, NONE OF THE OTHER CALLERS HAVE THEIR HAND UP.
05:04:07.466: >> Mayor Taylor: IF ANY REMAINING CALLERS WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK, PRESS STAR NINE NOW. ANY OF THE REMAINING CALLERS WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK, PLEASE PRESS STAR NINE.
05:04:26.919: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER 269. PHONE NUMBER ENDING IN 269, PLEASE GO AHEAD.
05:04:34.727: >> MY NAME IS BEN CUNNINGHAM. I'M A MEMBER OF WARD 4 AND I REALLY WANT TO APPRECIATE WHAT YOU GUYS PASSED TODAY, AS FAR AS DECRIMINALIZING ENTHEOGENIC AND OTHER MEDICINAL MEDICINE, PLANT-BASED MEDICINES. I HAVE DEALT WITH DEPRESSION SINCE I WAS 13, I REALLY WANTED TO PUT A HUMAN FACE ON THIS. A LOT OF SCIENTISTS, Ph.D.s, DOCTORS, ALL IN, BUT I WANT YOU TO REALLY INDICATE HOW MUCH IT MEANS TO ME. I HAVE DONE SSRIs AND ANTI-DEPRESSANTS AND BARBITURATES, MOOD STABILIZERS AND I HAVE HAD ELECTROCONVULSIVE SHOCK THERAPY. AND I FINALLY -- ON A WHIM OF THE 15th PSYCHOLOGIST I EVER SAW, I WAS RECOMMENDED TO DO THIS TO TRY SOME MUSHROOMS AND IT SAVED MY LIFE. IT REALLY SAVED MY LIFE. AND THE POTENTIAL FOR THIS IS SO HUGE. I MEAN, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BUDING BEAIFUL WATERFRONTS AND THAT'S GREAT. I LOVE THIS CITY. BUT THE PROGRESSIVENESS TO OPEN OUR EYES TO THE POTENTIAL OF WHAT WE HAVE NOT YET -- NOT YET BEEN ABLE TO GIVE TO THOSE WHO NEED IT. I WANT TO APPLAUD AND THANK MY CITY COUNCIL, MY HOMETOWN FOR WHAT YOU HAVE DONE TODAY, BECAUSE IT LITERALLY WILL SAVE LIVES. ONLY THING  THAT DIDN'T TAKE ME FROM THIS WORLD IS THE LOVE FOR MY FAMILY AND I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE OHERE DON'T HAVE WHAT I HAVE. SO HOPEFULLY WHAT YOU HAVE DONE TODAY WILL ALLOW THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT AS LUCKY AS I WAS TO LIVE AND THRIVE IN THIS BEAUTIFUL WORLD THAT WE HAVE. ONCE AGAIN I THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
05:07:12.017: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. CLERK MAYOR, THERE ARE NO OTHER CALLERS WITH THEIR HANDS UP.
05:07:20.926: >> Mayor Taylor: ANY CALLERS NOT YET SPOKEN, PRESS STAR NINE NOW NO TO SPEAK. SEEING NO ONE, PUBLIC COMMENT IS CLOSED. ARE THERE COMMUNICATIONS TODAY FROM COUNCIL? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
05:07:40.980: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: MAYOR TAKER. THANKS TO THE LAST CALLER WHO SHARED HIS PERSONAL STORY TO US AND THE REST OF THE WORLD. PRETTY POWERFUL AND PRETTY AWESOME WAY TO END ONE OF THESE LONG MEETINGS. SO THANK YOU. I ALSO WANTED TO GIVE THANKS TO COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN AT OUR LAST MEETING WITH THE SHORT-TERM RENTALS. I KNOW THAT YOU AREN'T PERHAPS A BIG FAN OF THAT ORDINANCE THAT WAS PASSED INITIALLY, BUT AS TIME WENT ON AND DISCUSSIONS CONTINUED, I WAS VERY SURPRISED, IN A POSITIVE WAY, HOW YOU CAME AROUND TO THE POSITION YOU DID IN THE END, WITH -- WITH THAT AND TOOK A VERY COURAGEOUS STAND, AN UNPOPULAR ONE, BUT ONE THAT DESERVES ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND RECOGNITION. I KNOW WE DON'T AGREE MANY OF THE TIMES OR EVEN MOST OF THE TIMES, BUT I FELT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO SAY THANKS AND I APPRECIATE HOW YOU EVOLVED IN YOUR DECISION ON THAT. AS TO MICHELLE HUE HUGHES THAT E RAISED ABOUT IC ICPOC ON WEIGHI. IN I REACHED OUT TO DR. JACKSON AND ASKED HER IF SHE WOULD LIKE TO OR WANTED TO OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT AND INVITED HER TO GIVE ME SOME OF HER THOUGHTS AND IDEAS ON IT. SHE SAID THAT NOT INTERESTED IN DOING IT AT THIS MEETING, THAT THE COMMISSION DID GET A CHANCE TO REVIEW THE CONTRACT AND SUBCOMMITTEES SO THAT THEY DIDN'T VIOLATE OPEN MEETINGS ACT SO THAT THE COMMISSION DID GET TO REVIEW THE CONTRACT AHEAD OF TIME IN SMALLER GROUPS. AND THEY WILL SHARE THEIR OPINION OF THEIR -- OF THE CONTRACT TOMORROW AT THE REGULARLY SCHEDULED MEETING AT 6:00 TOMORROW. SO PAY ATTENTION TO TOMORROW'S POC'S MEETIN ABOUT THE LEADERSHIP OF THE AND THE COMMISSION WHEN IT COMES TO THE POLICE CONTRACT. AND IT'S JUST GO TO, YOU KNOW, FINALLY HAVE A MEETING WHERE WE CAN DISCUSS THINGS AND HAVE AN HONEST DISCUSSION. WE SAW TWO DEVELOPMENTS THAT WERE DESCRIBED AS TRANSFORMATIVE, THAT WILL BRING IN A DIFFERENT TYPE OF DEVELOPMENT IN OUR COMMUNITY, A DIFFERENT STYLE AND I KNOW IT DOESN'T MEET THE LEVEL THAT COUNCILMECOUNCILMEMBER HAYNER WO SEE, BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THIS COUNCIL IS NOT THE ANTI-COUNCIL IT'S BEEN LABELED. AND SO LATER ON THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS CAN BE COUNTED, BUT THERE ARE MANY, AND THEY WILL CONTINUE TO BE FOR THE NEXT FEW MEETINGS. THANK YOU.
05:11:04.616: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
05:11:05.551: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES, I JUST THOUGHT WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT THE STUDENTS HAVING RETURNED AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE COVID-19 CASES HAVE RISEN SIGNIFICANTLY. I WONDER IF WE SHOULD TALK FOR A MINUTE ABOUT WHAT WE ARE DOING TO FLATTEN THE CURVE NOW THAT THE STUDENTS HAVE COME BACK. I'M GETTING PHONE CALLS ON THAT. AND THAT HAS INCREASED AGAIN. IT'S BEEN SHOWING UP IN THE VARIOUS DORMS. AND THE DANCE SCHOOL AND THE MUSIC SCHOOL CLOSED. AND SO MY CONSTITUENTS ARE ASKING ME WHAT CAN WE DO TO FLATTEN THE CURVE. YOU KNOW, SHOULD WE BE ENFORCING MORE WITH THE MASKS? SHOULD WE BE DNG MORE ENCOURAGEMENT. POSITIVE MESSAGES ON THE MASKS?
05:12:24.196: >> City Admin. Crawford: MAYOR, DO YOU WANT ME TO RESPOND TO THIS? COUNCILMEMBER, BANNISTER, THE CITY CONTINUES TO DO THAT. -- DO THE THING THAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING, AND THAT INCLUDES THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE AGGREGATION OUTSIDE THROUGH THE PROGRAM WE WORKED WITH. THE AMBASSADOR PROGRAM CHANGED. WE DO CONTINUE TO ENFORCE THAT. WE ARE CONTINUING TO DO EVERYTHING THAT WE HAVE DONE. AS YOU ARE PROBABLY AWARE, A LOT OF RESPONSIBILITY COMES DOWN TO INDIVIDUALS MAKING PERSONAL CHOICES. BETWEEN DATA AND ENFORCEMENT, I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE STAND. AS THE VIRUS DOES DOES ITS COURSE AND RIGHT NOW, I'M WATCHING THAT VERY CLOSELY, MYSELF, AS WELL, I SURE MOST OF THE COMMUNITY HAS. IT HAS GONE UP. IT'S NOT AT THE LEVEL THAT THE UNIVERSITY IS CONSIDERING, YOU KNOW, CLOSING OR ANYTHING. IT'S STILL WELL WITHIN THE PARAMETERS THAT THEY ESTABLISHED FOR THEIR OPERATIONS. AS FAR AS THE CITY OPERATIONS. WE ARE DOING ALL THE TNGSHAT WE HAVE LAID OUT TO DO.
05:13:44.176: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
05:13:46.979: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT STAFF LOOK AT THE IMPACT ON THE NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS. NEAR MAIN AND PACKARD. I REMN VERY, VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT, BASED ON THE REPORTS THAT I HAVE RECEIVED AND ALSO JUST FOR CLARIFICATION, EARLIER TONIGHT, WE WERE DISCUSSING HOUSING AND SHORT TERM AND LONG-TERM HOUSING NEEDS AND I MADE A COMMENT ABOUT STAFFING LACK OF EFFECTIVENESS AND IT WAS SPECIFIC TO HOUSING. NEITHER STAFF, NOR COUNCIL HAS HAD ANY IMPACT ON THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN. THEY HAVE ADDED THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS WITHOUT ADDING ANY HOUSING. AND IT'S TIME THAT WE HAD A SERIOUS DISCUSSION WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN ABOUT PROVIDING SOME WORKFORCE HOUSING CAMPUS.DENT HOUSING ON NORTH THANK YOU.
05:14:55.213: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
05:14:56.181: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES, COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD. THAT NEEDS TO BE PART OF OUR NEXT DISCUSSION. PITCHED ON A CONVERSATION. SHAME ON ME THAT I SUGGESTED THAT WE COULD SPEAK TO OUR NEIGHBORHOOD PARTNERS HERE. THERE'S 300 HOUSES FOR SALE IN THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR AND THE MEDIAN SALE PRICE IS $441,000. IT GIVES YOU HOW SUCCESSFUL THAT, IS WITHOUT OUR PARERS STEPPING UP. A COUPLE OF DATE SENSITIVE THINGS. TOMORROW YOU MAY OR MAY NOT BE INTERESTED IN THIS SORT OF THING, BUT IT'S BATTERY DAY AT TESLA AND THEY ARE GOING TO BE HUMOR IS THEY ARE ANNOUNCING A BIG BREAKTHROUGH AT ENERGY DENSITY FOR BATTERIES AND THAT'S GOING TO PUSH THE PARITY OF DEVELOPING ELECTRIC VEHICLES WITH GAS VEHICLES. THEY ARE OPENING MAYBE IN 2023, WHICH IS JUST TWO YEARS AWAY FROM NOW. THAT'S GOOD PEOPLE WHO WANT TO GET ELECTRIC. I KNOW SOME OF US ALREADY HAVE ELECTRIC CARS. EVENTUALLY IT WILL TRICKLE DOWN SO I CAN AFFORD ONE. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT. ANOTHER SENSITIVE THING COMES FROM THE BOOMING BUSINESSES ON RTH MAIN, A COMPANY CALLED ARBORIES, NOT ONLY HAVE THEY PROVIDED GOOD JOBS FOR OVER A DECADE DOWN THERE AND FACILITATED THE GROWTH OF WOMEN-OWNED ORGANIC TEA COOPERATIVES ALL OVER THE WORLD BUT THEY HAVE ALSO RUN THESE CONTESTS TO DEAL WITH LOCAL ISSUES, FOOD IUES FAIR TRADE TRE ISSUES AND SO ON. IT'S ABOUT COMPOSTING. IT'S CAN YOU DIG IT AND IT GOES UNTIL SEPTEMBER 30th. YOU CAN FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THAT AT AR ARBORTEAS.COM. IT'S NEIGHBORHOOD COMPOSTING AND BACKYARD COMPOSTG. IT'S GOOD THAT PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN GARDENING AND LOCAL FOOD. SO LASTLY, I GET A KICK OUT OF THESE FOLKS WHO HAVE NEVER MET ME AND DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ME EXCEPT THEY HAVE TAKEN IT UPON ME TO DIG THROUGH MY PAST, AND PRESUME MY INTENTIONS AND EXTRACT A FEW WORDS OUT OF THE -- PROBABLY HUNDREDS OF HOURS, I HAVE SPENT TALKING ABOUT THESE MATTERS TO TRY AND BE NEGATIVE TOWARDS ME. I SPOKE TO COUNCIL IN 2017 ABOUT AAPD AND WE RECOGNIZE SOMEWHAT RELATIVELY VERY PROGRESSIVE POLICE DEPARTMENT
