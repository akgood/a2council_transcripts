IT'S A MATTER OF UPGRADING THE ELECTRICAL HAVING SPOT ELECTRIC IT'S A MATTER OF UPGRADING THE ELECTRICAL HAVING SPOT ELECTRIC RADIANT HEAT IN VARIOUS SPOTS ELECTRICAL HAVING SPOT ELECTRIC RADIANT HEAT IN VARIOUS SPOTS AND SOLAR IS THAT WITH THAT RADIANT HEAT IN VARIOUS SPOTS AND SOLAR IS THAT WITH THAT NETTED OUT IN A WAY THAT SOLVES AND SOLAR IS THAT WITH THAT NETTED OUT IN A WAY THAT SOLVES THE PROBLEM WITH HAVING NETTED OUT IN A WAY THAT SOLVES THE PROBLEM WITH HAVING VENTILATION AND EVERYTHING ELSE THE PROBLEM WITH HAVING VENTILATION AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT THAT'S POSSIBLE AND JUST VENTILATION AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT THAT'S POSSIBLE AND JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WOULD THAT THAT'S POSSIBLE AND JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WOULD WORK FOR? TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WOULD WORK FOR? YEAH, I KNOW THAT WAS PART WORK FOR? YEAH, I KNOW THAT WAS PART OF THE PROPOSAL BUT WE TALKED YEAH, I KNOW THAT WAS PART OF THE PROPOSAL BUT WE TALKED ABOUT WITH HILLARY THE MOST OF THE PROPOSAL BUT WE TALKED ABOUT WITH HILLARY THE MOST RECENTLY SHE DID TALK ABOUT ABOUT WITH HILLARY THE MOST RECENTLY SHE DID TALK ABOUT HAVING HEATERS SORT OF IN THE RECENTLY SHE DID TALK ABOUT HAVING HEATERS SORT OF IN THE SPINE OF THE ROOF ALL THE WAY HAVING HEATERS SORT OF IN THE SPINE OF THE ROOF ALL THE WAY AROUND THE MARKET AND THEN SPINE OF THE ROOF ALL THE WAY AROUND THE MARKET AND THEN COMBINED.
