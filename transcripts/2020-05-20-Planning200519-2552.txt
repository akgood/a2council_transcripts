BEFORE US THIS EVENING WE HAVE THE MAY 5th, 2020, MEETING MINUTES. DO I HAVE A COMMISSIONER THAT WILL MOVE THOSE. MOVED BY COMMISSIONER BRIGGS AND SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER MILLS. ANY DISCUSSION OR CHANGES TO THE MINUTES FROM MAY 5th? SEEING NO ONE, ALL OF THOSE IN FAVOR PLEASE SAY AYE. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? THOSE ARE APPROVED. MOVING ON TO REPORTS FROM CITY ADMINISTRATION, CITY COUNCIL, PLANNING MANAGER, PLANNING COMMISSION OFFICERS AND COMMITTEES AND WRITTEN COMMUNICATIONS AND PETITIONS. WE'LL BEGIN WITH COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN WITH A REPORT FROM CITY COUNCIL.
00:03:08.605: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR. IN A WAY THAT ONLY COMMISSIONER WOODS CAN APPRECIATE, LAST NIGHT WAS BUDGET NIGHT. SO WE WRAPPED UP OUR MEETING AT 3:00 IN THE MORNING. WE -- A FEW ITEMS THAT I WANT TO CALL TO YOUR ATTENTION FROM THE MEETING, BOTH REGARDING THE BUDGET BUT ALSO SEPARATE FROM THE BUDGET. THE FIRST WAS WE ONCE AGAIN HAD BEFORE US THE A2ZERO CARBON NEUTRALITY PLAN WHICH AIMS TO GET US FROM WHERE WE ARE TODAY TO BEING A NET NEUTRAL CASH OP EMISSIONS CITY OVER THE NEXT DECADE. WE DID -- WE ALSO RECEIVED SOME NEW INFORMATION AROUND SOME PRELIMINARY FINANCIAL PLANNING AND GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES OF HOW WE WILL UPDATE THE PLAN ON AN ONGOING BASIS TO KEEP IT A LIVING DOCUMENT, TO BETTER REFLECT ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY, ADVANCES IN CHANGES IN OUR COMMUNITY, AND ALSO CHANGES IN THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND WHAT FUNDING MECHANISMS MAY BE AVAILABLE TO US. WE DID POSTPONE IT UNTIL THE FIRST MEETING IN JUNE. SO THAT WILL BE BACK ON OUR AGENDA THEN IT HAS -- IT POTENTIALLY HAS IMPLICATIONS TO HAND USE, WHICH IS WHY I BRING IT UP HERE -- LAND USE WHICH IS WHY I BRING IT UP HERE. THERE ARE CERTAIN ENGINEERING TOOLS THAT WE CAN IMPLEMENT TO HELP US GET TO CARBON NEUTRALITY, LIKE, FOR EXAMPLE, YOU KNOW, ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SOURCES OR SOLAR ENERGY SOURCES, ELECTRIC VEHICLES, BUT THERE'S ALSO JUST CHANGES IN THE WAY THAT WE LIVE. AND THE WAY THAT WE STRUCTURE OUR BUILT ENVIRONMENT. IT WILL BE VERY RELEVANT TO THIS BODY. THE GARNET PUD ZONING AND SUPPLEMENTAL SITE PLAN WERE BOTH APPROVED AT THEIR FINAL READING BY CITY COUNCIL. CITY COUNCIL DID AMEND THE DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT TO MAKE THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CONTRIBUTION $88,000. IF YOU RECALL SOME OF THE CONVERSATION WE HAD IS THAT BECAUSE OF THE CHANGE IN EXPECTATION THAT CITY COUNCIL REQUIRES OF THE DEVELOPER TO PURSUE THE PUD ZONING VERSUS C1A ZONING, THE ASK WAS TOO HIGH AND NOT VIABLE. AND CITY COUNCIL DID BRING THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING DOWN FROM $300,000 TO $88,000. AND THAT WAS APPROVED LAST NIGHT. AND FINALLY, THE CITY DID APPROVE A BUDGET FOR FISCAL -- FOR THIS NEXT FISCAL YEAR, STARTING JULY 1. YOU KNOW, IT'S A $467 MILLION BUDGET THAT WAS FOR THE MOST PART WRITTEN AND CREATED BEFORE ANY OF US WERE FAMILIAR WITH OR COULD ANTICIPATE THE SWEEPING EFFECTS THAT COVID WOULD HAVE ON OUR -- ON OUR WORLD, ON OUR NATION, ON OUR STATE, AND EVEN HERE IN ANN ARBOR. AND PESSIMISTIC PROJECTIONS SHOW THAT WE WILL SEE A $10 MILLION SHORTFALL ON OUR BUDGET. WE NEED TO FIND WAYS TO REVISE OUR BUDGET TO BETTER REFLECT THE ECONOMIC REALITIES THAT WE HAVE. THAT MEANS SOME SHARED SACRIFICE ACROSS THE BOARD BY OUR MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT AND WHAT THOSE -- WHAT THOSE TRANSLATE INTO -- INTO OUR LIVES AS PUBLIC SERVANTS AND NEIGHBORS AND RESIDENTS ARE YET TO BE FULLY KNOWN. CITY COUNCIL DID AMEND THE BUDGET TO REDUCE IT BY $1.2 MILLION, BUT THAT STILL LEAVES AMPLE ROOM AND NECESSITY TO REDUCE IT EVEN MORE. SO ONE EXAMPLE OF A SAVINGS THAT THE CITY MAY PURSUE, THAT IS MOST RELEVANT TO THIS BODY, IS TO POSTPONE THE MASTER PLAN. THIS IS A IF DELAYED COULD PRODUCE SIGNIFICANT SAVINGS FOR THE CITY AND THE MUNICIPAL ORGANIZATION. SO NO ACTION ON THAT YET, BUT KNOW THAT THAT IS WITHIN THE REALM REASON. SO I WANTED TO BRING THAT TO YOUR ATTENTION. IF YOU WANT A FULL COMPREHENSIVE UPDATE, ON ALL THE THINGS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS BRAINSTORMING AND BETTER ARTICULATING AROUND WHAT THOSE COST SAVINGS IN THE FUTURE MAY BE, I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO WATCH THE SECOND HALF OF OUR WORK SESSION ON MAY 11th AND YOU CAN FIND THAT RECORDING ONLINE ON THE CITY'S WEBSITE AND YOUTUBE BY LOOKING AT CTN, OUR PUBLIC ACCESS STATION. IF YOU WANT TO SEE SOME REALLY DEDICATED PUBLIC SERVANTS FIND WAYS THAT ARE NOT EASY OR FUN, BUT DIFFICULT AND TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR BUDGETS STAYED BALANCE, WHILE ALSO PROTECTING OUR PUBLIC SERVANTS, I ENCOURAGE YOU TO WATCH IT, IT'S AMAZING HOW QUICKLY WE COULD MOVE AND WITH PROFESSIONALISM. THAT'S IT FOR ME.
00:08:20.283: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU. MR. LENART, DO YOU HAVE A REPORT FOR US THIS EVENING?
00:08:25.022: >> JUST TWO ITEMS. ONE, CONGRATULATIONS TO COMMISSIONER WOODS AND GIBB-RANDALL. THEY WERE REAPPOINTED TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION LAST EVENING AS WELL.
00:08:33.397: >> Councilmember Ackerman: I'M SORRY, YEAH. OF COURSE.
00:08:39.569: >> Planning Manager:  THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONTINUED SERVICE. AND JUST, A FAIR WARNING TO THE ORDINANCE REVISION COMMITTEE MEETING SCHEDULED TORE NEXT WEEK, AT THIS POINT, I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING SCHEDULED THERE. I WILL KEEP YOU APPRIZED. IT'S STILL ON THE CALENDAR FOR NOW, BUT I WILL BE MAKING A DECISION ON THAT MEETING IN CONSULTATION WITH THE COMMITTEE OVER THE COMING WEEKS. THAT'S ALL I HAVE.
00:09:02.726: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU. PLANNING COMMISSION OFFICERS AND COMMITTEES? ANY REPORTS? COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL.
00:09:09.299: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: I MET WITH THE DDA PARTNERS GROUP AFTER KIND OF A HIATUS BECAUSE OF COVID, AND NOT DIRECTLY RELATED TO THIS BODY, BUT I -- IT WAS INTERESTING TO HEAR EVERYBODY'S REPORTS ABOUT HOW THEY WERE HANDLING THINGS AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT REALLY STUCK OUT FOR ME THAT I THOUGHT MIGHT BE OF INTEREST TO EVERYBODY ELSE IS HOW THE AATA IS HANDLING ALL OF THIS. AND THAT THEIR RIDERSHIP IS DOWN 90% DURING ALL OF THIS, AND THAT THEY HAVE CUT ABOUT 25% IN TERMS OF THEIR ROUTES AND THINGS LIKE THAT, AND THAT THEY HAD LAID OFF A DECENT AMOUNT OR FURLOUGHED A DECENT AMOUNT OF EMPLOYEES. I THINK IT WAS 15%, WHEN I LAST HEARD. IT WAS SOBERING TO HEAR ALL OF THAT, BUT I THOUGHT I WOULD PASS IT ALONG TO EVERYBODY ELSE TOO, JUST TO SEE, YOU KNOW, AS WE ARE ALL GRAPPLING WITH THE RIPPLE EFFECTS OF ALL OF THIS, IT'S JUST REACHING EVERYWHERE. AND AS WE ARE OFTEN DISCUSSING THE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM, I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR PEOPLE  TO HEAR WHAT THE STATUS OF THAT IS NOW.
00:10:20.203: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER WOODS.
00:10:23.106: >> Commissioner Woods: THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION HAS NOT MET FOR THE PAST COUPLE OF MONTHS, BUT WE WILL MEET TOMORROW VIA A ZOOM MEETING. WE DID SOME PRACTICE OF THAT YESTERDAY, SO HOPEFULLY WE WILL ALL GET IT RIGHT. I'M SURE THAT HOPEFULLY WE MAY HAVE SOMETHING TO REPORT BACK FROM THAT, AND WE DO HAVE A NEW COMMISSIONER APPOINTED TO THAT COMMITTEE AS WELL AND I APOLOGIZE, I DID NOT WRITE DOWN HIS NAME. NOW I THINK WE ARE AT FULL -- FULL FORCE. THANK YOU.
00:10:53.003: >> GREAT.
00:10:53.503: >> Chair Milshteyn: GREAT.THANK. ANY OTHER COMMITTEE REPORTS. WE DO HAVE SOME WRITTEN COMMUNICATIONS IN OUR PACKETS. SO PLEASE TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. NOW WE MOVE ON TO AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION AND LET ME HEAD TO THAT POINT IN OUR SCRIPT. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PERSONS TO SPEAK FOR UP TO THREE MINUTES ABOUT AN ISSUE THAT IS NOT LISTED AS A PUBLIC HEARING ON THIS AGENDA. TO COMMENT ON SUCH OTHER MATTERS, PLEASE CALL 1-8 1-877-853-5247, AND ENTER MEETING ID975-0054-2638. WE WILL SELECT CALLERS WHO HAVE RAISED THEIR HAND ONE BY ONE, USING THE LAST THREE DIGITS OF YOUR PHONE NUMBER.

WHEN SPEAK, PLEASE MOVE TO A QUIET AREA AND MUTINY TELEINVESTIGATION OR BACKGROUND SOUNDS SO THAT WE MAY HEAR YOU CLEARLY. PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS AT THE BEGINNING OF YOUR COMMENTS. DO WE HAVE ANYONE AT THIS TIME WOULD WWHO WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESE PLANNING COMMISSION?
00:12:22.626: >> Planning Manager:  NO INDICATION.
00:12:24.728: >> Chair Milshteyn: ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU. SO MOVING ON TO PUBLIC HEARINGS SCHEDULED FOR OUR NEXT BUSINESS MEETING, MR. LENART?
00:12:35.639: >> Planning Manager:  YES, WE HAVE ONE NEW PUBLIC HEARING ITEM. IT IS LIBERTY TOWNHOME SITE PLAN FOR CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL. THIS IS A PROPOSED PLAN TO DEVELOP NINE THREE-STORY BUILDINGS OF TOWNHOUSE AAPARTMENTS ON A 4.6-ACRE SITE LOCATED AT 2658 WEST LIBERTYITY STREET, TUCKED NEAR THE OVERPASS THERE WHO NEED A REFERENCE POINT. ACCESS IS PROVIDED ELECTRIC A DRIVEWAY -- FROM A DRIVEWAY TO WEST LIBERTY STREET. THE TOWNHOUSE ISED TO HAVE A TWO-CAR GARAGE AND IT'S ZONED R4B AND AS A REMINDER, THE PLANNING COMMISSION HAD POSTPONED A CONSIDERATION OF A PROPOSED REZONING AND SITE PLAN FOR SEVERAL PROPERTIES ON VAHALLA AND THAT'S SCHEDULED TO RETURN AS OLD BUSINESS ON THAT AGENDA.
00:13:29.326: >> Chair Milshteyn: GREAT. THANK YOU. WE NOW MOVE ON TO UNFINISHED BUSINESS, AND THAT IS SIGN ORDINANCE AMENDMENTS FOR CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL. SO I WILL WELCOME MR. CHANG AND MR. LENART TO PRESENT THE UPDATES AND NEW INFORMATION.
00:13:52.649: >> Planning Manager:  GREAT. THANK YOU. I'M GOING TO TAKE THE INITIAL LEAD HERE AND CHRIS IS GOING TO JUMP IN AS HE SEES FIT, AND AS I NEED HIM FOR VALUABLE INFORMATION. FIRST OF ALL, I JUST WANT TO SET THE STAGE A LITTLE BIT. I'M GOING TO DO THE WORST. I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO SORT OF SCROLL THROUGH THE DRAFT DOCUMENT WITH YOU AND I FEEL THAT THAT'S IMPORTANT TO DO SO BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THE DRAFT THAT WAS INCLUDED IN YOUR PACKET DID A GOOD JOB OF SUMMARIZING THE OUTSTANDING CHANGES THAT HAD ALREADY BEEN DISCUSSED BY THE PLANNING COMMISSION, AND ANY OUTSTANDING ISSUES. THEY ARE MODEST IN QUANTITY AND I DON'T THINK IT WILL TAKE VERY LONG. IT POINTS OUT A COUPLE OF DISCUSSION POINTS THAT I WOULD LIKE YOUR -- IF WE CAN GET TO A RESOLUTION ON THIS EVENING BEING I FEEL LIKE WE WILL BE IN A GOOD POSITION TO POTENTIALLY ADVANCE THIS TO CITY COUNCIL FOR CONSIDERATION. SO THAT -- THAT REVISED VERSION THAT I WILL SHARE WITH YOU HAS BEEN PROVIDED TO YOU AS COMMISSIONERS AND IT'S BEEN SHARED ON THE WEBSITE AND IT HAS BEEN SHARED TO THOSE WHO WE KNOW HAVE BEEN ACT ENVIRONMENTALLY FOLLOWING THIS ORDINANCE DEVELOPMENT AS WELL. SO WE HAVE SHARED THAT AS WIDELY AS WE CAN. AS A REMINDER, TO C SET THE NAG, OUR SIGN CODE LIKE MANY ASPECTS OF OUR CODE, AS WE DISCUSSED PARTICULARLY IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE UNITTIFIED DEVELOPMENT TIME. THE SIGN ORDINANCES LOOK DIFFERENT FROM THAT AND THE SIGN ORDINANCE, I THINK TECHNOLOGY AND PRACTICE IN SIGNAGE HAD -- HAS OUTPACED THE AMENDMENTS TO OUR SIGN ORDINANCE. ADDITIONALLY, THERE WAS A REALLY SIGNIFICANT COURT CASE AT THE SUPREME COURT, IT'S THE TOWN OF GILBERT vs. REED, AND THE SUPREME COURT ESSENTIALLY -- I'M NOT A LAWYER ANIM AND I'M NOT GG YOU LEGAL ADVICE, BUT THE SUPREME COURT SAID THAT THOSE SIGN ORDINANCES THAT BASICALLY RELY AS THE CONTENT OF THE SEEN AS REGULATION HAVE A HIGHER PROPENSITY TO BE FOUND UNCONSTITUTIONAL. THAT IS MANY OF THE ASPECTS OF REGULATING SIGNAGE SHOULD NOT BE DEPENDENT ON THE SPECIFIC CONTENT OF THE SIGN ITSELF, AS A BALANCE OF PUBLIC WELFARE AND PROTECTION OF FREE SPEECH OPPORTUNITIES. AND SO OUR CURRENT ORDINANCE HAS MANY PROVISIONS THAT SPECIFICALLY RELATE TO SPECIFIC CONTENT ON SIGNS. IT DEFINES SIGNS BASED ON THAT CONTENT, AND IN SOME CASES -- NOT ALL CASES, VERY SPECIFIC WAYS. AND SO FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS WE HAVE UNDERTAKEN THE REASON TO UP WITH THIS. WE WORKED WITH A CONSULTANT THAT REALLY PROGRESSED US QUITE FAR ALONG, AND THEN MOST RECENTLY WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS FROM A STAFF PERSPECTIVE, BUT ALSO WITH THE INVOLVEMENT OF OUR ATTORNEY'S OFFICE AND SEVERAL ALREADY CONSIDERATIONS BY UBISK BOARD AT OUR PUBLIC HEARINGS AND PUBLIC SESSIONS. I WILL PRESENT TO YOU AND THE PUBLIC AN OVERVIEW EVER THE MAJOR COMPONENT OF THE CODE, SHH CHANGES THAT WE HAVE MADE ON PRIOR DISCUSSIONS AND A COUPLE OF DISCUSSION POINTS THAT I WOULD LIKE TO COME BACK TO AFTER I GO THROUGH THE PRESENTATION AND SEE WHAT DESIRE THE PLANNING COMMISSION HAS IN THIS REGARD. ANY QUESTIONS BEFORE I GET STARTED? OKAY. ALL RIGHT. CAN EVERYBODY SEE WHAT IT SHOULD BE NOW THE UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE MAY 19th, 2020, VERSION OF THE SIGN ORDINANCE? ALL RIGHT. SO WHAT YOU HAVE HERE IS A DRAFT THAT STARTS FROM THE BASE OF THIS -- THE BASE OF THIS DRAFT STARTS FROM THE LAST VERSION OF THIS ORDINANCE THAT WAS PUBLISHED ON THE CITY'S WEBSITE, WHICH WAS IN DECEMBER OF 2019. I THINK THE SPECIFIC DAY WAS 12-13-19 AND THAT WAS LINKED IN A MEMORANDUM I PROVIDED TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION AND THE PUBLIC. AND ALL OF THE ANNOTATED CHANGES ARE EITHER -- HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED BY THE PLANNING COMMISSION OR THE DISCUSSION POINTS I WOULD LIKE TO SEEK RESOLUTION OF THIS EVENING. SO AGAIN, APPLICABILITY. THIS IS SETTING THE STAGE OF SIGNS CAN ONLY BE MAINTAINED PURSUANT TO THIS CHAPTER AND THIS IS HOW WE REGULATE SIGNS. THE ORDINANCE HAS A MUCH MORE SIGNIFICANT INTENSE SECTION THAT SEEKS TO PROVIDE THE BASIS ABOUT WHY THESE REGULATIONS ARE IMPORTANT TO US AND THEY MEET A LOT OF COMMUNITY GOALS. THEY MEET SAFETY GOALS AND QUALITY OF LIFE GOALS AND ECONOMIC AND DEVELOPMENT AND PROPERTY VALUES HELPING US NAVIGATE OUR WAY TO BUSINESSES AND LOCATIONS WITHIN THE CITY. AVOIDING NUANCE-HILIKE CONDITIOS AND FUNDAMENTAL EMERGENCY RESPONSE TYPE OF PUBLIC SAFETY AS WELL. AND SO THE INTENSE SECTION HAS NOT CHANGED SINCE THE PREVIOUS VERSION THAT YOU HAVE SEEN, BUT IT'S MORE EXPANSIVE THAN OUR CURRENT SIGN ORDINANCES. LIKE OUR CURRENT SIGN ORDINANCE, WE FLAT OUT PROHIBIT A VARIETY OF TYPES OF SIGNS. MANY OF THESE HAVE BEEN CARRIED FORWARD FROM THE CURRENT ORDINANCE, AND SOME OF THEM ARE EXPANDED. SOME OF THE NEW ONES THAT HAVE EVOLVED FROM THE CURRENT ORDINANCE ARE THINGS LIKE INFLATABLES, FEATHER NAGS HAVE FLAGS HAVEBEEN A SORT OF NEW TYN THAT HAVE BEEN PRESENT IN THE COMMUNITY, SINCE OUR ORDINANCE WAS DRAFTED. ROPE LIGHTS OR SIMILAR LIGHTS ATTACHED OR DRAWING ATTENTION TO A SIGN. THIS IS A NEW PROVISION. SIGNS THAT MIGHT EMIT SMOKE OR VAPOR OR MATTER OR SOUND OR ODOR. I CAN'T SAY THAT I HAVE FACED A LOT OF PERMITS IN THAT REGARD, BUT THIS TECHNOLOGY SEEMS TO BE EVOLVING RELATIVELY QUICKLY. SO IF OUR INTENTION IS TO REDUCE SUCH NUANCES IN THE COMMUNITY. AND THEN WE HAVE ADDED A -- SORT OF A LARGE-SCALE SIGNS WITH THE SIGN AREA OVER 200 SQUARE FEET WHICH IS OUR MAXIMUM SIGN SIZE FOR DISTRICTS. PERHAPS THE MOST HELPFUL EVOLUTION OF THIS ORDINANCE, IF YOU ARE A ZONING COORDINATOR IS THIS CALCULATING SIGN ORDER. AND IN OUR CURRENT ORDINANCE, WE HAVE LANGUAGE THAT CALCULATES SIGN LANGUAGE ONLY AS IT EXTENDS TO MESSAGE UNITS. AND, IN FACT, WE RESTRICT THE NUMBER OF MESSAGE UNITS OR WORDS OR ATTRIBUTES OF A SIGN THAT CAN BE INCLUDED ON A SIGN. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO MEASURE. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE. AGAIN, IT IS STARTING TO LOOK AT CONTENT OF A SIGN VERSUS LARGER IMPACTS OF THE SIGN ITSELF TO THE COMMUNITY. SO WHAT WE HAVE DONE HERE IS TRIED TO BE MUCH MORE DETAILED ABOUT HOW WE CALCULATE SIGN AREA AND IT DOESN'T EVOLVE FROM PREVIOUS VERSIONS THAT YOU HAVE SEEN. NOT ONLY DO WE PROVIDE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TEXT IN SOME OF THE WAYS THAT WE MEASURE SIGNS, WHETHER THEY HAVE -- THEY ARE ILLUMINATED FROM THE BACK, WHETHER THEY ARE TEMPORARY SIGNS, WHETHER THEY ARE EVEN THREE DIMENSIONAL SIGNS. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DO IN THIS ORDINANCE IS WE SEEK TO ACTUALLY PROVIDE A LOT OF ILLUSTRATIONS THAT MAKES IT VERY UNDERSTANDABLE FOR BOTH USERS, THE PUBLIC, SIGN CONTRACTORS, BUSINESSES AND CERTAINLY US AS WE INTERPRET AND ISSUE PERMITS AND RESPOND TO PERMITS BASED ON THE ORDINANCE. SIGN HEIGHT MINIMUM HEIGHT AND MAXIMUM HEIGHT, IT'S SIMILAR TO HOW OUR CURRENT ORDINANCE READS. CHANGEABLE COPY, THERE'S STILL A LIMITATION ON THE TOTAL AREA OF A SIGN THAT CAN BE ALLOCATED TO THAT USE. ONE CHANGE FROM OUR CURRENT ORDINANCE THAT IS REFLECTED IN THE DRAFT THAT YOU HAVE SEEN PREVIOUSLY AND PRESENTED PREVIOUSLY IS THAT ELECTRONIC MESSAGE SIGNS NOW CAN'T CHANGE MORE THAN ONCE EVERY 15 MINUTES. THIS PROPOSED ORDINANCE WOULD ALLOW SUCH SIGNS TO CHANGE NOT MORE THAN ONCE PER MINUTE. SO FROM 15 MINUTES TO ONE MINUTE RESTRICTION ON DURATION OF SORT OF A STAT IMAGE OF THOSE ELECTRONIC MESSAGE SIGNS. SIGN ILLUMINATION HAS BEEN SOMETHING THAT WE TALKED ABOUT IN A SIGNIFICANT -- A LARGE EXTENT. WE HAVE ADDED A LOT OF REQUIREMENTS AROUND LIGHTING. IT HAS TO BE A CONSTANT COLOR AND INTENSITY. IT CAN'T BE SHIFTING COLORS. IT CAN'T BE AS WE HAVE ALREADY SHOWN IN PREVIOUS, IT CAN'T BE BLINKING OR SPINNING OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. IT HAS TO BE IN A MANNER TO PREVENT GLARE. IN SEEKING SOME OF THE COMPATIBILITY WITH THIS PROPOSED ORDINANCE AND THE PROPOSED OUTDOOR LIGHTING ORDINANCE THAT THE PLANNING COMMISSION WAS SEEING ON A CONSISTENT BASIS, ONE RECOMMENDATION IS THAT WE USE CONSISTENT LANGUAGE OF FULLY SHIELDED FIXTURES. TO BE CLEAR, I HAVE DONE MY BEST TO MAKE SURE I'M UNDERSTANDING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE, BUT A FULLY SHIELDED FIXTURE IS PROBABLY A LOWER STANDARD TO ACHIEVE. IT IS A FIXTURE THAT SORT OF SIMPLY DIRECTS ALL LIGHT FROM A 90-DEGREE PLAIN TO BE DOWNWARD OR OUTWARD AS OPPOSED TO -- AND YOU CAN'T SEE THE LIGHT SOURCE. A FULL CUTOFF FIXTURE TAKES THAT A LITTLE BIT FURTHER AND SAYS NOT ONLY DOES THAT PLANE APPLY, BUT THERE'S A LIMITATION WITH THE FIRST BANDS OF DEGREES AROUND THAT PLANE, ONLY A MINIMUM AMOUNT OF LIGHT IS PERMITTED WITHIN THAT BAND AS WELL. FOR THE PURPOSE OF CONSISTENCY WITH THE PROPOSED ORDINANCE AND FRANKLY, I THINK IT'S PROBABLY EASIER FOR US TO VISUALIZE, I'M PROPOSING FULLY SHIELDED FIXTURES. ANY CONCERNS OR VALIDATIONS I'M HAPPY TO LOOK AT. THIS IS A DISCUSSION POINT. THE SIGN ORDINANCE AS PRESENTED IS CONSISTENT WITH THE PROPOSED OUTDOOR LIGHTING ORDINANCE THAT RESTRICTS ANY AMBIENT LIGHT TO NOT EXCEED .1-FOOT CANDLES AT A RESIDENTIAL ZONING DISTRICT. I THINK A SPECIFIC QUESTION AND IT'S BEEN RAISED BY COMMISSIONER BRIGGS IN A PRETTY THOUGHTFUL WAY. THERE'S A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT WAYS WE CAN APPROACH THIS. GENERALLY, WE CAN LEAVE IT LIKE THIS AND LET THE OUTDOOR LIGHTING ORDINANCE MORE BROADLY REGULATE ALL OUTDOOR PATHS ON PROPERTIES BESIDES RESIDENTIAL. WE COULD STRIKE THIS ALL TOGETHER AND JUST SIMILARLY LET THAT -- THAT ORDINANCE GOVERN ALL LIGHT TRESPASS OR WE COULD ATTEMPT TO BRING IN ADDITIONAL LEVELS FOR LIGHT TRESPASS SPECIFICALLY FOR SIGNS AT NONRESIDENTIAL PROPERTY IN ANY SORT OF LEVEL OR CHARACTERIZATION THAT WE DESIRE. MY INSTINCT IS THAT WE LEAVE THIS AS IT IS. IT MAINTAINS A SPECIFIC SIGN BARRIER TO OUR MOST SENSITIVE PERHAPS CONCERN AND LET THAT OUTDOOR LIGHTING ORDINANCE THEN POTENTIALLY MODIFY THIS AS IT'S ADOPTED. THAT'S A SPECIFIC DISCUSSION POINT I WOULD LIKE THE PLANNING COMMISSION FEEDBACK ON. WHEN YOU ARE EXTERNALLY LIGHTING' LIGHT SOURCE, IT HAS TO BE MOUNTED ABOVE THE SIGN AGAIN. SO IT'S POINTING DOWNWARD GENERALLY, AS OPPOSED TO UPWARDS. THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS TO THIS. THE ILLUMINATION REQUIREMENTS WOULD NOT APPLY TO AN INTERNALLY ILLUMINATED SIGN BOX. IT WOULD NOT APPLY TO LIGHTING PLACE BEHIND OPAQUE LETTERING THAT HAS A HALO EFFECT IF YOU WILL. IT WOULD NOT APPLY TO A NEON SIGN OR ELECTRONIC MESSAGE SIGN. THESE ARE TYPES OF SIGNS THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BE A MORE DIRECT QUOTE/UNQUOTE EXPOSURE TO YOUR VIEWER. THE ELECTRONIC MESSAGE SIGN IS CONSISTENT. WE ARE STILL REQUIRING LIMITS ON NITS. THEY ARE CONTROLLED IN SUCH A WAY WHERE LIMITING THE AMOUNT THAT HAD -- THAT WOULD HAVE TO HAPPEN BETWEEN DUSK AND DAWN. WE ARE ADDING SOME LANGUAGE THAT'S -- BOTH ADDING AND MAINTAINING SOME LANGUAGE THAT SAYS IT HAS TO MANE TAKEN A LIGHT METER AND AUTOMATICALLY DIM TO RESPOND TO AMBIENT LIGHT. WE ADDED LANGUAGE THAT SAYS IF REQUESTED BY THE CITY, THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE COMPLIANT WITH NITS AND THE AVAILABILITY OF THAT EQUIPMENT TO DIM AND SENSE LIGHT METERS SO THE SIGN CAN RESPOND TO THAT. THE ELECTRONIC MESSAGES SIGNS HAVE TO CHANGE WITHIN THAT ONE -- NO MORE THAN ONE MINUTE TIME PERIOD INSTANTANEOUSLY. THEY ARE NOT PERMITTED TO HAVE ANY FADING OR SPRINKLING OR DISSOLVE EFFECT. IT HAS TO BE AN INSTANTANEOUS CHANGE OVER A MESSAGE. AND IF THE LIGHT SOURCES FAIL ON THAT SCREEN IT HAS TO DEFAULT TO A PLAQUE SCREEN AS OPPOSED TO EMITTING LIGHT SCREEN. ILLUMINATED SIGNS, THEY HAVE TO BE TURNED OFF AND IF A LOT DOESN'T CONTAIN A BUSINESS, YOU HAVE TO TURN THEM OFF BETWEEN 10:00 AT NIGHT AND 6 A.M. AND ON LOTS THAT DO CONTAIN A BUSINESS, CURRENTLY THE DRAFT IS THAT THEY HAVE TO BE TURNED OFF AT LEAST ONE HOUR AFTER THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS AND ONE HOUR -- THEY CAN'T COME ON BEFORE ONE HOUR OF BUSINESS OPENING. THIS IS DISTINCT FROM THE PROPOSED LIGHTING ORDINANCE, WHICH SETS THOSE SIMILAR ADDITIONAL WINDOWS FOR HALF AN HOUR. AND I THINK THAT IT'S -- IT MAKES SENSE FOR US TO BE CONSISTENT ON THOSE AS WE CONSIDER THOSE GOING FORWARD AND THAT'S ANOTHER POINT THAT I WOULD APPRECIATE PLANNING COMMISSION FEEDBACK ON. ADDRESSES ARE EXEMPT. YOU CAN PUT ADDRESS NUMBERS ON YOUR PROPERTY. THEY CAN BE DIFFERENT SIZES, WHETHER THEY ARE RESIDENTIAL OR COMMERCIAL. IF YOU ARE PROJECTING A SIGN -- IN I SORT OF STRUCTURE IN THE RIGHT-OF-WAY, YOU NEED APPROVAL OF THE CITY. YOU CAN'T INTERFERE, OF COURSE WITH STREET SIGNS OR VISIBILITY. AWNINGAND CANOPY SIGNS SHOULD BE HUNG. YOU CAN CAN'T HAVE AN AWNING AND HAVE A SIGN SORT OF PROJECTING OFF OF THAT AWNING. THIS IS INTENDED FOR THOSE STRUCTURES TO READ IN THEIR MORE TRADITIONAL WAY. THEY CAN HAVE SIGNAGE AIF I.D AO THEM BUT IT SHOULD NOT BE ON TOP OF THEM OR PROJECTING OUT FROM THEM. SAFETY AND MAINTENANCE, I'M SORRY, THESE SHOULD BE ITEMIZED BY NUMBER. SO I WILL CERTAINY HAD CORRECTLT THAT. WE ADDED MORE STANDARDS FROM THE CURRENT ORDINANCE ABOUT MEASURING A SIGN. WHETHER IT HAS VEGETATION GROWING THROUGH IT, WHETHER IT HAS A HIGH DEGREE OF PAINTING, PEELING PAINT. IT GIVES US LOTS OF OPPORTUNITIES TO SAY THAT THIS IS NOT MEETING OUR SAFETY AND MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS. THIS IS A NEW SECTION FROM THE PREVIOUS VERSION, STARTING WITH LETTER G HERE. WE ARE SPECIFICALLY DETERMINING HOW THESE SIGN REGULATIONS WOULD APPLY TO PREVIOUSLY APPROVED PUD DISTRICT BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT GENERALLY LISTED IN ALL OF YOU ARE REFERENCES HERE. -- ALL OF OUR REFERENCES HERE. GENERALLY, WE ARE SAYING WHEN A PUD IS LOCATED WITHIN OR ABUTTING THE DDA DISTRICT, IT WOULD BE A D1, D2, C1AR SET OF REGULATIONS. WHEN IT'S NOT ABUTTING THAT, AND ONLY APPLIES RESIDENTIAL. WE WOULD APPLY THE RESIDENTIAL SIGN RESTRICTIONS AND THEN FOR THOSE THAT ARE MIXED USE OR DON'T ALLOW RESIDENTIAL USES, IT WOULD BE THE OTHER MIXED USE AND NONRESIDENTIAL SPECIAL PURPOSE DISTRICT. THAT WOULD BE SIMILAR TO OUR COMMERCIAL DISTRICTS, FOR EXAMPLE. THERE'S A HELICOPTER FLYING OVER MY HOUSE. THIS TABLE SUMMARIZES THAT FROM BELOW AND WE ALSO ARE NOW SAYING AND FOR FUTURE PUD DISTRICTS, AS PART OF THOSE SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS WE WILL DECLARE WHICH PROVISIONS WE WANT TO APPLY TO THAT PARTICULAR PUD DISTRICT. SO THIS WHOLE SECTION IS INTENDED TO ADDRESS EVERYTHING THAT'S ALREADY BEEN APPROVED IN THE PUD AND THOSE THAT WE'LL BE GOING THROUGH. THIS IS THE MEAT OF PERMANENT SIGNS AND THERE ARE -- THERE ARE CHANGES FROM PREVIOUS VERSION. WE ARE NOW MORE SPECIFICALLY DEFINING SIGNS. RIGHT NOW WE HAVE ANY SIGNS ATTACHED TO A BUILDING UNDER OUR CURRENT ORDINANCE. WE ARE STARTING TO BREAK THOSE INTO PROJECT SIGNS, WALL SIGNS AND AWNING SIGNS AND CANOPY SIGNS. THE OVERALL SIZE THAT IS AFFORDED TO ALL BUSINESSES IS THE SAME. IT'S UP TO TWO SQUARE FEET OF AREA PER ONE LINEAR FOOT OF BUSINESS FRONTAGE. WE ARE MAINTAINING PROVISION FOR WALL SIGNS, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT WE AREN'T PLACING ANY MAXIMUM QUANTITY OF ALL SIGNS. WE ARE PLACING A TOTAL ON THE AREA, BUT IF YOU WANT TO USE UP YOUR AREA WITH FOUR WALL SIGNS THAT'S P PERMISSIBLE. IF YOU WANT TO DO IT WITH ONE SIGN, THAT'S OKAY. WE ARE CHANGING WALL SIGNS TO SAY IT HAS TO BE LOCATED ON THE LOWEST 20 FEET OF THE BUILDING OR IF THE B THE BUILDING IS 45 R HIGHER, THE TOP 15 FEET. THE WALL SIGNS WILL HAVE TO BE CORRESPONDING WITH THE STREET FRONT ACCESS OR TALLER BUILDINGS IF SOMEONE WOULD LIKE TO PUT A WALL SIGN CLOSER TO THE TOP FOR A WIDER VISIBILITY, THEY HAVE THE OPTION TO ALLOCATE SOME OF THEIR EXISTING SQUARE FOOTAGE UP HIGHER. NOTHING IN THE MIDDLE, HOWEVER. WE ARE PUTTING LIMITS ON PROJECTING SIGNS. THAT'S NOT A LIMIT THAT WE HAVE NOW. PUTTING A HEIGHT ON THOSE AS WELL. MAINTAINING RESTRICTION THAT ANY SIGNS THAT DO PROJECT INTO THE RIGHT-OF-WAY HAVE TO MAINTAIN CLEARANCE AND AS WE INDICATED, ANY SORT OF AWNING OR CANOPY SIGNS WILL HAVE TO BE ENTIRELY WITHIN THOSE STRUCTURES AND THOSE ARE A MAXIMUM OF ONE PER BUSINESS FRONTAGE. SIMILAR AREA, AGAIN, NO CHANGE IN THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF AREA FOR OTHER BUSINESS DISTRICTS. YOU WILL SEE BY THE ADDITION OF THE PUD TABLE I ALREADY SHOWED YOU, THAT JUST MOVES ALL THE TABLE REFERENCES DOWN ONE. THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE SEEING WITH THOSE CHANGES. HERE FOR THE FIRST TIME, WE ARE PROVIDING FREE STANDING SIGNS. ONE PER STREET FRONTAGE. MINIMUM SETBACK OF 5 FEET, THEY HAVE TO BE A MINIMUM OF 200 FEET BETWEEN EACH FREE STANDING SIGN ON THE SAME PREMISES. THIS WOULD COME INTO PLAY SO THAT YOU DON'T HAVE IN CLOSE PROXIMITY ON A CORNER, FOR EXAMPLE. THERE WILL HAVE TO BE A SEPARATION BETWEEN THOSE TWO SIGNS TO MEA MEET THE SEPARATIOL REQUIREMENT AND THEN SIMILAR STANDARDS APPLIED FOR THE OTHER TYPES OF SIGNS AS WE SAW PREVIOUSLY IN THE DOWNTOWN DISTRICTS. RESIDENTIAL ZONING DISTRICTS THIS IS A CHANGE FROM THE PREVIOUS VERSION AND THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT THE PLANNING COMMISSION SPECIFICALLY ASKED US TO GET SOME OTHER COMMUNITY FEEDBACK ON. WE DID A NARROW SURVEY ABOUT ADDING -- ALLOWING SIGNAGE ON ONE AND TWO-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL. THE PREVIOUS DRAFT PROVIDED TO SUCH SIGNS. WE COT THAT FEEDBACK BACK. IT WAS -- I WILL LET CHRIS SUMMARIZE THAT BUT I THINK IT WAS GENERALLY SUPPORTIVE OF THAT PROVISION. WE ALSO FROM A STAFF PERSPECTIVE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE ALLOWING THINGS FROM THAT -- FROM THAT NOTION OF FLEXIBILITY OF SIGNAGE WITHOUT CONTENT, THINGS FROM NOT ONLY PERHAPS THE PROPERTY MAINTENANCE CONTACT BUT HISTORIC MARKER, MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE PROVIDING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR A VARIETY OF SIGNS. IN THIS CASE, ON A RELATIVELY LIMITED SIZE AND SCALE BASIS. THAT WOULD BE -- WE'RE NOT PLACING ANY HEIGHT RESTRICTION, ONE PER BUILDING. KEEP IN MIND, ONE QUESTION HAS COME UP THROUGH THIS WHOLE VIEW. IF YOU ARE PROPOSING SIGNAGE WITHIN AN HISTORIC DISTRICT, YOU HAVE TO SATISFY BOTH THE ZONING ORDINANCE AND THE HISTORIC DISTRICT REQUIREMENTS. SO FOR EXAMPLE, IN THIS CASE, EVEN THOUGH THIS DOESN'T HAVE A RESTRICTION ON THE PLACEMENT OF A SIGN FOR ONE -- FOR A SINGLE DWELLING UNIT, THE HISTORIC DISTRICT UNIT WOULD HAVE REQUIREMENTS THAT WOULD STILL HAVE TO BE APPLIED FOR SIGNAGE IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE. A CHANGE FROM OUR CURRENT ORDINANCE. WE ARE BREAKING DOWN THE TYPES OF SIGNS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO DIFFERENT SIZES OF MULTIFAMILY INSTEAD OF JUST ONE CATEGORY OF MULTIFAMILY. SO THREE OR FOUR DWELLING UNITS CAN ONLY HAVE A WALL SIGN. BUILDINGS OF FIVE OR MORE DWELLING COULD POTENTIALLY HAVE A WALL SIGN OR A FREE STANDING SIGN OR BOTH. UP TO THE MAXIMUM OF THE SIZE LIMITATIONS PROJECTED. AND THEN NONRESIDENTIAL USES ALSO HAVE A WIDE VARIETY OF SIZE RESTRICTIONS OR REQUIREMENTS. THIS WILL BE NONRESIDENTIAL UNITS IN RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS. IT COULD BE A CHURCH. IT COULD BE AI SCHOOL, THOSE TYPE -- A SCHOOL, THOSE TYPES OF USES. OTHER THAN THE TRADITIONAL ONE AND TWO FAMILY UNITS, THIS IS NOT A CHANGE. WINDOW SIGNS IS ANOTHER CHANGE. WE HAVE ADDED A CLARIFICATION OF INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR WINDOW SIGNS. AND RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS, WE'RE ALLOWING INTERIOR WINDOW SIGNS IN ANY WINDOW WITHOUT ANY MAXIMUM SIGN AREA. THIS WOULD BE ME PLACING A POSTER AGAINST THE INSIDE OF MY BEDROOM WINDOW OR SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT. IF, HOWEVER, YOU WANT TO AFFIX IT MORE PERMANENTLY AS LETTERING ON THE WINDOW, THAT IS GOING TO BE COUNTED AS A WALL SIGN AND SUBJECT TO THE GENTLEMAN EVERY FOOTAGE REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR -- TO THE SQUARE FOOTAGE REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR DWELLING, IN THE RESIDENTIAL ZONING DISTRICT. IN THE CASE OF NONRESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS, WE'RE LUMPING BOTH INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR SIGNS TO GO. THEY CAN ONLY BE IN THE GROUND FLOOR WINDOWS AND THEY CAN EXCEED THE TOTAL -- A TOTAL OF 25% OF THE GROUND FLOOR WINDOW AREA. THIS IS INTENDED VERY SPECIFICALLY TO ALLOW THE FLEXIBILITY THAT IF, YOU KNOW, FOR EXAMPLE, YOU HAD FOUR EQUALLY SIZED WINDOWS YOU COULD POTENTIALLY FILL UP ONE OF THEM WITH SIGNAGE, BUT THEN THE OTHER THREE WOULD HAVE TO BE COMPLETELY OPEN. OR YOU COULD CHOOSE TO DISTRIBUTE THAT AMONGST THOSE WINDOWS AS OPPOSED TO INDIVIDUAL WINDOWS NOT ALLOWING TO HAVE MORE THAN 25%.
00:37:39.107: >> TEMPORARY SIGNS WAS ANOTHER TOPIC THAT WE HAVE GOTTEN A LOT OF -- HAD A LOT OF DISCUSSION AT THE PREVIOUS PLANNING COMMISSION MEETING. WE TALKED ABOUT THE COMBINATION OF THE UNLIMITED TEMPORARY SIGN AND THE BUILDING FOR LOT FOR SALE, AND THE POST LANGUAGE WAS TO CONSOLIDATE THESE. AND SO WHAT THE UNLIMITED SIGN IS, IT IS -- IT PROVIDES, I THINK, A -- IT PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR FREE SPEECH, ESSENTIALLY OF ANY PROPERTY OWNER IN THE CITY. IT'S MODEST, IT'S UP TO THREE SQUARE FEET. IT COULD BE PLACED ON THE PROPERTY -- IT'S A NONCOMMERCIAL MESSAGE, HOWEVER, IN THE EVENT THAT THAT PROPERTY IS FOR SALE OR LEASE, YOU WOULD BE PERMITTED TO UTILIZE THAT FOR A COMMERCIAL MESSAGE IN THAT CASE. IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A FOR SALE SORE FOR LEASE MESSAGE, IF THAT HAPPENS TO BE FOR SALE OR FOR LEASE, YOU COULD USE IT FOR A COMMERCIAL MESSAGE WITHOUT THE CORRESPONDING MAXIMUM DURATIONS THAT ARE GOING TO APPLY TO ALL AREA TEMPORARY SIGNS AND ALL RESIDENTIAL AND NONRESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS. NO CHANGES TO THE SIZES OF THOSE. AS A REMINDER, THIS IS PROVIDING SORT OF A I WILL SCALABILITY AMOUNT OF THE SQUARE FOOTAGE BASED ON THE SIZE OF THE LOT, MAXIMUM OF FREE STANDING OR TEMPORARY SIGNS, TEMPORARY BASIS, AND ALL LIMITED TO A MAXIMUM DURATION OF 65 DAYS WITH THE AT LEAST A 30-DAYBREAK PERIOD IN BETWEEN ANY SUBSEQUENT DISPLAYS. NO CHANGE TO THE MATERIALS AND CONSTRUCTIONS, LIABILITY. SO NOW WE GET INTO WHEN PERMITS ARE REQUIRED. ANOTHER SPECIFIC CHANGE THAT WAS DISCUSSED AT THE PLANNING COMMISSION WAS ELIMINATING THE REQUIREMENT FOR TEMPORARY SIGNS AND COMMERCIAL DISTRICTS, PREVIOUSLY WE HAD ONLY EXEMPTED RESIDENTIAL TEMPORARY SIGNS FROM THAT REQUIREMENT. SO THIS IS RESPONSIVE TO THAT PLANNING COMMISSION DIRECTION. THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THAT WILL MAKE ENFORCEMENT MORE DIFFICULT, AND I AGREE THAT IT WILL. TEMPORARY SIGNS ARE INHERENTLY DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE. WE -- WE WILL USE EVERY PIECE OF INFORMATION THAT'S AVAILABLE TO US IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES. BUT I THINK, AGAIN, THIS IS RESPONSIVE TO PREVIOUS PLANNING COMMISSION DIRECTION. WE HAVE -- STAFF PROPOSES TO STRIKE THIS LANGUAGE. IT'S JUST A DUPLICATION THAT SAYS, YOU DON'T NEED A PERMIT TO DISPLAY YOUR STREET ADDRESS NUMBERS. THIS IS ACTUALLY PROVIDED FOR IN AN EARLIER SECTION. THAT'S EXEMPT FROM THIS ORDINANCE. THE REQUIREMENTS OF APPLI APPLICATIONS. SAME VERSION AS YOU HAVE SEEN BEFORE. NON-CONFORMING SIGN CHANGES HAVE NOT HAPPENED. THIS IS A MEAT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW SIGNS MAY BE ABLE TO BE CONTINUED OR NOT CONTINUED. THESE ARE THE STANDARDS BY WHICH YOU CAN ARE OR CANNOT CONTINUE USE OF THEM AND THESE ARE THE STANDARDS THAT WE WOULD THEN APPLY WHEN WE ARE MAKING USE OF PERMIT AND THOSE QUESTIONS AS WELL. THROUGH THIS ORDINANCE, THERE WILL BE SOME SIGNS MADE NON-CONFORMING BECAUSE WE ARE REDUCING THE MAXIMUM SIZE OF SOME FOR MULTIFAMILY, FOR EXAMPLE. LIKE THE CURRENT. THEY CAN CONTINUE UNDER THESE ORDINANCES BUT THERE ARE PROVISIONS IF THEY TOTALLY REPLACE IT OR THE BUSINESS GOES AWAY, THOSE ARE TRIGGERS WHERE WE CAN GET APPLIANCE AND IT AL L APPLY FOR NEW SIGNAGE REQUEST FROM THE CITY. A TYPO HERE THAT I JUST PULLED OUT. SORRY. WE'RE IN THE HOME STRETCH. THIS IS REMOVING A SPECIFIC PROVISION THAT WAS, I THINK, CAME OUT OF OUR EXISTING SIGN -- THE SIGN ORDINANCE ABOUT ADDITIONAL ENFORCEMENT POWERS OF THE PLANNING MANAGER. I'M NOT A JUDGE AND I THINK IT MAKES SENSE FOR OUR SIGN ENFORCEMENT TO MIRROR THE ENFORCEMENT OF OTHER PROVISIONS OF THE UDC IN THE CITY AND I'M PROPOSING TO STRIKE THIS. NO CHANGE TO THIS. THIS IS THE GENERALIZED TERMS OF CATEGORIES OF DISTRICTS WHEN WE ARE REFERRING TO A NONRESIDENTIAL OR A NONRESIDENTIAL AND SPECIAL PURPOSE DISTRICT. THIS IS WHAT ZONING DISTRICTS THIS MEANS. AND THEN WE GET INTO DEFINITIONS. THESE ARE THOSE LETTERS OF OUR DEFINITIONS THAT HAVE CHANGED, THAT YOU HAVE SEEN BEFORE. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ONES AT THIS POINT, THAT I WILL CALL OUT ARE THE WINDOW -- WELL, IN THE DEFINITION OF SIGNAGE, WE HAVE REFLECTED THE NEW -- THE -- THE NEW TERMS THAT WE HAVE -- THAT WE ARE PUTTING INTO PLACE INSTEAD OF ATTACHED SIGNS, FOR EXAMPLE, THE DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS. AND AS WELL AS INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR WINDOW SIGNS. SO HERE WE HAVE NOW ADDED CAN KNOW ANY SIGN. WE HAVE ADDED FREE STANDING SIGNS INSTEAD OF A GROUND SIGN. NEON SIGN, I'M NOT SURE THAT WAS DEFINED BEFORE. PROJECTING SIGN. AND THEN THE PROVISIONS OF BOTH INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR WINDOW SIGNS. SO FROM MY LENS, I FEEL LIKE THIS THIS PARTICULAR DRAFT IS RESPONSIVE TO THE CHANGES THAT YOU HAVE PREVIOUSLY DIRECTED. A COUPLE OTHER STAFF SUGGESTIONS THAT I THINK ARE PRETTY MINOR IN THE CONTEXT OF THE DRAFT, I'M HAPPY TO ADDRESS ANY QUESTIONS. THE POINTS OR PARTICULAR DIRECTION, I FEEL THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR US AS STAFF ARE THE NOTION OF LIGHT TRESPASS FOR SIGNS SPECIFICALLY. THE DURATION OF BEFORE AND AFTER BUSINESSES ARE OPENING. CERTAINLY ANY VALIDATION OF FULLY CUTOFF AND FULLY SHIELDED. OTHER THAN THAT, WE ARE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS.
00:44:33.288: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU, MR. LENART. AT THIS TIME, I WOULD LIKE TO OPEN UP A PUBLIC HEARING ON THIS ITEM. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PERSONS TO SPEAK FOR UP TO THREE MINUTES ABOUT THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE SIGN ORDINANCE. PUBLIC COMMENT MAY BE MADE BY CALLING 877853-5247, AND ENTERING ENTERING MEETING IS 9 # 5-0054-2638. CITY STAFF WILL WILL RAISE THEIR HANDS. YOU WILL BE IDENTIFIED BY THE LAST THREE DIGITS OF YOUR TELEPHONE NUMBER. YOU WILL HEAR AN AUTOMATED ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE HOST IS ALLOWING YOU TO SPEAK. WHEN SPEAKING PLEASE MOVE TO A QUIET AREA AND MUTE ANY TELEVISION OR BACKGROUND SOUNDS. LOO ESTATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS AT THE BEGINNING OF YOUR COMMENT. -- PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS IF HE BEGINNING OF YOUR COMMENT.
00:45:35.817: >> Planning Manager:  CALLER ENDING WITH 355, YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION ON THE SIGN ORDINANCE?
00:45:44.092: >> KIRK WESTPHAL, 3505 CHARTER PLACE. IT'S GREAT TO SEE ALL OF YOUR FACES EVEN THOUGH DIGITALLY. ONE DAY I WILL SEE YOU IN PERSON. THANKS SO MUCH FOR YOUR HARD WORK ON THIS. I UNDERSTAND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO GET THIS ORDER THAT ON IN PLACE, AND YOU GUYS HAVE SPENT A LOT OF TIME ON IT AND A LOT OF CONSULTANT HOURS SO THAT'S GETTING EVERYTHING BUTTONED UP IN TERMS OF LEGA LEGALITY AND IT AND BEING CONTENT NEUTRAL AND HOW TO MEASURE. THESE ARE ALL I FELT STAFF AND THE COMMUNITY IN THE LONG RUN. I SENT SOME LENGTHY COMMENTS. I WON'T REPEAT ALL OF THEM HERE AND I AM SURE YOU WON'T BE MAKING THEM ON THE FLY TONIGHT. I GUESS I WOULD WANT TO OBSERVE I -- I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THE CHANGES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE SINCE THE CONSULTANT DID THE COMMUNITY EXERCISE AND THE VISIONING AND THEIR TOOLS THAT THEY DEPLOYED FOR PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE AND MAP IN, WHICH I THOUGHT WERE GREAT. AND IT -- THE DEPLOYMENT OF THIS SMALL SURVEY REGARDING SIGNAGE ON, YOU KNOW, ONE AND TWO-FAMILY STRUCTURES, WAS CONCERNING. IT ENDED UP CONTRAVENING THE FEEDBACK THAT THE -- THAT THE CONSULCONSULTANT GOT. SO I UNDERSTAND THIS MAY BE SOME ISSUES THAT WE HAVE TO WORK OUT WITH HISTORIC DESIGNATION AND OTHER WAYS OF ALLOWING THOSE TYPES OF SIGNAGE TO CONTINUE. BUT MY OVERALL -- MY OVERALL FEELING ABOUT SIGNAGE ON HOMES, PARTICULARLY IN STUDENT RENTAL DISTRICTS AS YOU MIGHT HAVE GATHERED IS QUITE NEGATIVE. I FEEL LIKE IT IS A SELF-FULFILLING PROFESSITY IN THESE NEIGHBORHOODS AND YOU GO DOWN BLOCKS AND HOUSE AFTER HOUSE WITH OXFORD OR WHATEVER PLASTERED ON THE FRONT. I DON'T THINK IT LENDS ITSELF TO A MIXING OF USES AND A DIVERSE COMMUNITY. I GUESS ANOTHER LARGER OBSERVATION I WOULD MAKE IS -- IT SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF THIS -- I'M SORRY, IS THAT THREE MINUTES?
00:48:22.450: >> Planning Manager:  30 SECONDS MORE.
00:48:23.785: >> 30 SECONDS. A LOT OF THIS IS PLAYING DEFENSE. I FEEL A LOT HAS CHANGED IN TERMS OF TECHNOLOGY AND WHAT WE EXPECT OUT OF OUR CITY AND THE DEGREE OF URBANIZATION. WE STARTED OUT WITH GPS AND NOW SMARTPHONES. I GUESS WAS SURPRISED THAT T SIZES OF PERMANENT PHONES HAS NOT CHANGED MEASURABLY AT ALL. MY OTHER CONCERN IS THAT I'M AFRAID THAT THE TEMPORARY SIGNAGE WILL BE ABUSED BECAUSE PEOPLE CAN BASICALLY DEPLOY THEM FOR TWO MONTHS ON AND TAKE THEM DOWN FOR A MONTH AND CYCLE BACK AND THERE'S NO PERMITTING INVOLVED. THOSE ARE MY -- THE HIGHLIGHTS OF MY CONCERNS AND THANKS FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.
00:49:11.199: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION IN REGARDING TO THE SIGN ORDINANCE?
00:49:22.009: >> Planning Manager:  NO ONE ELSE HAS REQUESTED.
00:49:25.113: >> Chair Milshteyn: ALL RIGHT. SEEING NO ONE, I WILL READ THE MOTION, IF I CAN FIND IT. ONE QUICK SECOND. SORRY. ALL RIGHT. THE MOTION READS:  THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION HEREBY RECOMMENDS THAT THE MAYOR AND THE CITY COUNCIL APPROVE THE AMENDMENTS TO CHAPTER 55, UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE, SECTION 5.24. WILL I HAVE A COMMISSION MOVE THIS? MOVED BY COMMISSIONER WOODS, SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER MILLS. WE ARE IN DISCUSSION. I'M HAPPY TO START IF NOBODY ELSE -- COMMISSIONER WOODS?
00:50:16.864: >> Commissioner Woods: JUST A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS. MR. LENART, JUST TWO THINGS OCCURRED TO ME AND I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE ARE COVERED IN HAD THE SIGN ORDINANCE, BUT WHAT ABOUT SIGNS PAINTED ON THE SIDES OF BUILDINGS? AND I KNOW PEOPLE PROBABLY DON'T DO IT A LOT NOW, BUT THERE ARE -- IN SOME CITIES, THERE ARE PEOPLE ON THE SIDE OF A BUILDING ACTUALLY PAINT AND HERE I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT MURALS NECESSARILY. I'M NOT GOING INTO ART, BUT I'M TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT HAS CONTENT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. AND I'M SORRY I DON'T HAVE ANY EXAMPLES TO POINT YOU TOWARD HERE IN ANN ARBOR, BUT --
00:51:06.647: >> Planning Manager:  LIKE MAIL POUCH TOBACCO?
00:51:09.650: >> Commissioner Woods: THERE YOU GO. I JUST HAD A QUESTION ABOUT THAT, IF YOU COULD TELL US THAT WE ARE COVERED WITH THAT. AND THEN THE OTHER THING THAT OCCURRED TO ME WAS THE FACT THAT GIVEN COVID, SOMETIMES WE ARE SEEING LOCATIONS WHERE IT'S NECESSARY FOR PEOPLE TO PUT SIGNS ACTUALLY ON THE GROUND. BIG Xs OR STAND HERE OR DON'T MOVE FORWARD OR 6 FEET APART AND STUFF LIKE THAT. THOSE I WOULD ASSUME BE MORE LIKE TEMPORARY SIGNS AND SORT OF LIKE EXCEPTIONS WHICH WE WILL JUST MAKE SURE THERE'S NO LITTERING INVOLVED ARE SOMETHING LIKE THAT, OR, YOU KNOW, JUST CURIOUS ABOUT HOW WE ARE GOING TO ADDRESS THOSE THINGS. PLAPS SURE.
00:51:55.263: >> Planning Manager:  SURE. WHEN IT'S ON A PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY, WE WILL HAVE TO BE SPECIFICALLY APPROVING THAT AND -- I HAVE SEEN SIGNAGE, I THINK I HAVE SEEN MORE EXAMPLES OF JUST SORT OF SPACING DELINEATION AS OPPOSED TO SIGNING. I THINK THERE'S A WAY TO ACCOMMODATE THAT WITHOUT VEERING INTO SIGNAGE TERRITORY. AS IT RELATES TO PAINTED, THAT'S A WALL SIGN, WHETHER YOU ARE AFFIXING SOMETHING ON A BOX ON A WALL OR PAINTING ON THE WALL, THE WAY OUR DEFINITION, IS IT'S A WALL SIGN. IT'S SUBJECT TO THE SIZE RESTRICTIONS OF THAT BUSINESS, CALCULATED BASED ON THE LINEAL FRONTAGE. YOU CAN CHOOSE TO ALLOCATE WHAT PERCENTAGE THAT YOU WANT TO THAT. I CAN TELL YOU, WE PROBABLY HAVE THAT -- THAT IS AN OCCASIONAL QUESTION OF CONVERSATION AS TO CAN WE PUT UP A MURAL VERSUS IS IT A SIGN? AND SO IN THAT REGARD WE LOOK FOR COMMERCIAL MESSAGING, FRANKLY, AS A DETERMINANT, AND IT'S NORTH ALWAYS CUT AND DRY AND WE HAVE TO SOMETIMES MAKE THOSE DETERMINE NATIONS BUT IN SHORT, YOU COULD -- DETERMINATIONS BUT IN SHORT, WE WOULD ALLOW THAT TYPE OF SIGN AS A WALL SIGN. AND DO CURRENTLY.
00:53:17.611: >> Chair Milshteyn: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COMMISSIONER BRIGGS?
00:53:28.923: >> Commissioner Briggs: SO I WANTED TO BRING UP A FEW OF THE ISSUES THAT HAD GOTTEN RAISED FROM THE LIGHTING SUBCOMMITTEE THANKS TO SALLY OWIE AND JOHN MERSKY AND SARA WHO WAS ON THAT, RAISING SOME OF THE INCONSISTENCIES BETWEEN THIS ORDINANCE AND THE LIGHT -- THE PROPOSED LIGHTING ORDINANCE. AND BRETT HAS WHERE THOSE ARE. AND IN TERMS OF THE FULLY SHIELDED, I WAS THE ONE WHO ADVOCATED FOR THAT EARLIER. I'M FINE WITH MOVING FROM FULL CUT OFF TO FULLY SHIELDED. FOR THE LIGHT TRESPASS, I GUESS JUST TO BRING THAT BACK UP, KNYOUKNOW, THE QUESTION IS, IF S THERE AN ISSUE IF WE LEAVE IT AS IS AND JUST SAY NO CANDLES IN THE RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT. IF IT'S NOT EXCLUSIVELY MENTIONING THOSE OTHER CATEGORIES AND WE ADD THOSE IN LATER, DOES THAT CAUSE IT -- DOES IT CAUSE ANY ISSUES FOR OVERSIGHT? I GUESS THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ARE GOVERNING IN THE FUTURE. I GUESS THAT'S JUST A QUESTION IF WE LEAVE IT THAT WAY.
00:55:00.648: >> Planning Manager:  I THINK THE BIGGEST RISK IS IF THIS IS ADOPTED AND LIGHT TRESPASS COULD BE ON THIS. IT COULD LIGHT TRESPASS ON A NONRESIDENTIAL PROPERTY. SO IT WOULD ONLY BE SUBJECT TO WHAT MINIMAL LIGHTING STANDARDS WE HAVE CURRENTLY. AS THAT ORDINANCE IS ADOPTED, I WOULD -- I DON'T THINK THAT IT WILL BE A CONSISTITY PROBLEM. I'M PROMMING THAT'S THE INTENTION OF THE PLANNING COMMISSION CONSIDERING THIS, IS NOT TO SAY THAT WE SOMEHOW THINK THAT SIGN ELIMINATION WARRANTS ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY THAN OTHER OUTDOOR LIGHTING. IF THERE'S A DOWNSIDE TO LEAVING IT LIKE THIS OR WITHOUT ANY AMBIENT LIGHT TRESPASS AS PART OF THE SIGN ORDINANCE IS THERE WILL BE A WINDOW OF TIME WHERE WE ARE LYING IN OUR CURRENT ORDINANCE PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION OF ANYTHING MORE PROGRESSIVE. BRIG MM-HMM. YEAH. WE WITH RESPECT SURE. WE DIDN'T WANT TO CREATE A SITUATION WHERE IT HAS TO BE CHANGED IN MULTIPLE LOCATIONS. I KNOW WE WERE TRYING TO AVOID THAT. THIS IS A LITTLE BUILT OF REDUNDANCY. I DON'T KNOW THAT I WOULD PREDICT SIGNIFICANT SHIFTS MOVING FORWARD. I DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING. I THINK IT'S THAT GAP.
00:56:30.371: >> Planning Manager:  AND IF THAT PACKAGE IS TO PROGRESS, WHAT WE MIGHT JUST DO IS THEN INCLUDE ALTERATIONS TO THIS AT THIS POINT FOR THE INCONSISTENCY. AT THAT SAME TIME, WE MAY MODIFY THIS AND SAY SEE SECTION SUCH AND SUCH OF THE OUTDOOR LIGHTING AND THAT MIGHT BE THE TIME TO MAKE THE DECISION. BUT FOR NOW, I THINK IT'S SAFE TO LEAVE AT LEAST THIS  IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, WE ARE PROTECTING THEM FROM LIGHTING AND SIGNS. THAT'S MY TAKE. I THINK IT'S DEFINITIONLY A DISCUSSION POINT FOR THE LAPPING COMMISSION.
00:57:11.478: >> Commissioner Briggs: AND THEN THE OTHER ONE FROM THE LIGHTING SUBCOMMITTEE. THE PREFERENCE MAY BE TO MOVE TO 30 MINUTES BEFORE AND AFTER, CONSISTENT WITH THE LIGHTING ORDINANCE BUT WANTED TO GET THE FEEDBACK FROM EVERYBODY HERE, AS FAR AS WHAT DIRECTION THAT PREFERENCE WAS.
00:57:35.970: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER MILLS.
00:57:37.972: >> Vice Chair Mills: THOSE LAST TWO QUESTIONS WERE THE ONES I HAD AND MY ONLY WEIGHING IN ON THE TIMING, IN MY MIND THE LIGHT -- THE SIGN SHOULD GO OUT BEFORE THE PARKING LOT LIGHTS, FOR EXAMPLE. LIKE TO JUST SHOW THAT YOU ARE NOT OPEN ANYMORE. I THINK THAT WE ARE ENCOURAGING THESE LIGHTS -- ALL. LIGHTING TO GO OFF AND THE OTHER ORDINANCE 30 MINUTES AFTER, I WOULD MOVE TOWARDS THAT, IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO HAVE THE SIGN TO CONTINUE TO BE ILLUMINATED IF EVERYTHING ELSE IS OFF.
00:58:20.314: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER ABRONS.
00:58:22.082: >> Commissioner Abrons:  THANK YOU. I HAD A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THE TABLE 5.24.4. IT'S THE ONE THAT DESCRIBES HEIGHT, PLACEMENT FOR RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS PERMANENT SIGNS. ONE THING I WANTED TO CLARIFY WHICH CAME IN THE EMAIL FROM MR. WESTPHAL. I WANTED TO CONFIRM THAT WHAT I SEE HERE IS THE RESTRICTIONS ARE BASED ON USE, NOT ON ZONING. SO IT DOESN'T MATTER, RIGHT?
00:58:59.386: >> Planning Manager:  BOTH.
00:59:00.688: >> Commissioner Abrons:  SO RELATED TO THAT, I WAS WONDERING WHY DWELLINGS FIVE OR MORE UNITS -- OR WHY THERE'S SUCH A JUMP IN MAXIMUM SIGN AREA BETWEEN ONE AND TWO UNITS AND THREE AND UP. KIND OF WHAT THE THINKING WAS BEHIND THAT. OFTEN THOSE BUILDINGS IN KIND OF MASS AND STRUCTURE MIGHT BE THE SAME SIZE. SO THE PROPORTIONAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SIGN AND THE BUILDINGS SEEM TO CHANGE PRETTY RADICALLY.
00:59:30.851: >> Planning Manager:  YES, SO CURRENTLY WE PROVIDE UP TO 12 SQUARE FEET OF SIGNAGE FOR ANY MULTIFAMILY. AND SO WE -- I THINK THE POINT IS FAIR. YOU KNOW, THERE'S PROBABLY SOME SCALE SIMILARITIES IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES BETWEEN FIVE UNIT AND TWO UNIT FOR THAT MATTER. BUT WE THOUGHT THAT IT -- WE WILL THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS IT DID MAKE SENSE TO USE THAT AS A FURTHER SEPARATION OF -- OF SIGNAGE WE ARE DEFINITELY GIVING LARGER, MORE SIGNAGE I DON'T PROCESS THERE A PERFECT SPOT, WHEN YOU HAVE AN APARTMENT BUILDING THAT IS 100 UNITS. I THINK IT MAY BE REASONABLE TO FOR THAT TO HAVE MORE SIGNAGE THAN A DUPLEX, BUT THIS WAS AN ATTEMPT TO SEGREGATE OUR RESIDENTIAL USES AND PARTICULARLY MULTIFAMILY INTO SOME SMALLER CATEGORIES. THAT'S A GOOD POINT.
01:00:46.493: >> Commissioner Abrons:  I'M TALKING ABOUT THE NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE THE CALLER IS REFERRING TO. IN THAT INSTANCE, THEY ARE ALL SINGLE FAMILY HOMES SOME OF WHICH ARE SINGLE FAMILY OCCUPIED AND SOME OF WHICH ARE BROKEN UP INTO SIX APARTMENTS. SO -- IN THAT CASE, SUDDENLY YOU HAVE 6 SQUARE FOOT OF SIGNAGE ON WHAT IS OSTENSIBLY A SINGLE FAMILY HOME. I UNDERSTAND -- I UNDERSTAND A LINE HAS TO BE DRAWN SOMEWHERE AND I'M QUESTIONING PERHAPS WHERE IT IS OR WHAT THAT SIZE LIMIT SHOULD BE.
01:01:22.196: >> Planning Manager:  AND I THINK A PIECE OF IT IS ALSO INCREMENTALISM, FRANKLY. LIKE, YOU KNOW, RIGHT NOW PROVIDE MORE OPPORTUNITY THAN WE WOULD GOING FORWARD IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES. BUT, YEAH, IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE COMMISSIONER WANTED TO LOOK AT, WE COULD CERTAINLY CONSIDER PERHAPS THOSE CUTS OF DWELLING COMMUNITIES WOULD BE BETTER AND FEWER. MAYBE IT'S ONE TO FOUR, INSTEAD OF -- OR MAYBE THERE'S ADDITIONAL.
01:01:51.325: >> Commissioner Abrons:  AND THEN THE OTHER THING I WANTED TO ASK A QUESTION ABOUT, THAT THE CALLER ALSO RAISED WAS ONE ABOUT ENFORCEMENT AND THIS IS MORE MAYBE JUST REVEALING THAT I -- KIND OF IGNORANCE ON MY HALF ABOUT THE WAYS THAT THINGS GET ENFORCED. BUT MY ASSUMPTION IS THAT, YOU KNOW, SOMEBODY -- THE PERSON WOULD IS GOING TO PROBABLY MAKE THE COMPLAINT IS A NEIGHBOR, RIGHT? SOMEBODY IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD WHO IS UNHAPPY. AND IS IT THE CASE THAT LIKE A DATED PHOTOGRAPH OF A SIGN WOULD SUFFICE AS EVIDENCE OF THE KIND OF START DATE OF A TEMPORARY SIGN, SAY, IF THEY WERE CLAIMING IT WAS TOO LONG OR IS IT THE WITNESSING BY A CITY OFFICIAL?
01:02:35.135: >> Planning Manager:  MAYBE. SO I CAN TELL YOU FROM OUR EXPERIENCE, GENERALLY WHEN ENFORCING, IT'S WHEN A CITY AGENT WITNESSES, DOCUMENTS, AND CONDUCTS ALL ASPECT OF THAT ENFORCEMENT, WHETHER THAT'S ZONING, WHETHER THAT'S BUILDING, YOU NAME IT. WITH WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO PERSONALLY OBSERVE, WITNESS, AND FOLLOW UP ON THAT, IN RELATION TO ORDINANCE REQUIREMENTS THAT IS THE BEST. THE NEXT THING WE DO IS WE START RELYING ON EVIDENCE. AND THAT EVIDENCE COULD BE PHOTOGRAPHS THAT WE CAN DETERMINE AND RELY UPON, THAT THEY ARE FROM A PARTICULAR DATE AND THEY ACCURATELY REPRESENT SOMETHING. SOMETIMES WE LOOK AT PAST RECORDS. WE LOOK AT PAST PLANNING COMMISSION ACTION AND PAST ZONING OF APPEALS, AND RENTAL HOUSING INSPECTIONS AND HISTORIC PHOTOGRAPHS AND GIS AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHS. WE FRANKLY LOOK AT GOOGLE STREET VIEW AND WE DO OUR BEST TO PUT TOGETHER OUR BEST RESPONSE TO THAT PARTICULAR QUESTION. SO THE SHORT ANSWER IS MAYBE. I CAN'T SAY THAT IF YOU CALL THE CITY AND SAY, MY NEIGHBORS HAD THEIR TEMPORARY SIGN OUT FOR 66 DAYS THAT THAT WILL AUTOMATICALLY TO IT COMING DOWN THE NEXT DAY. AT WORST, IT WILL DRAW OUR ATTENTION TO IT. WE WILL BE ABLE TO START THE PROCESS TO DO THAT INVESTIGATION. MAYBE SEEK IF THERE IS DOCUMENTATION OR AT WORST WE WILL START MONITOR THAT AND MAKE SURE IT'S COMPLYING GOING FOR THE. THAT'S ULTIMATELY OUR GOAL. WE WANT TO ACHIEVE COMPLIANCE WITHOUT TICKETS OR COURT, THAT'S GOOD FOR EVERYBODY. DOES THAT HELP AT ALL?
01:04:32.119: >> Commissioner Abrons:  IT SEEMS LIKE THE TEMPORARY SIGN PROVISION IS GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE.
01:04:40.460: >> Planning Manager:  I WOULD SAY THAT'S TRUE NOW. THERE'S LIMITATIONS NOW ON TEMPORARY SIGNS AND WE ARE IN THAT SAME CIRCUMSTANCE. THERE ARE LIMITATIONS ON THE ABILITY TO PUT A POLITICAL SIGN IN FRONT OF YOUR HOME THAT'S EQUALLY DIFFICULT TO MEASURE AT TIMES.
01:04:59.780: >> Commissioner Abrons:  AND I WAS HAVING ONE OTHER QUESTION. WHY THERE IS NOT A PROVISION FOR TEMPORARY WINDOW SIGNS AND IN PARTICULAR, I'M THINKING LIKE HOLIDAY MAYBE BECAUSE WE ARE COMING OFF THE HOLIDAY LIGHTS. MAYBE THEY PAINTED IT, OR FOR A TEMPORARY AMOUNT OF TIME.
01:05:26.807: >> Planning Manager:  WELL, FOR RESIDENTIAL, INTERIOR SIGNS ARE NOT LIMITED. IF YOU WANTED TO COVER THE INTERIOR OF YOUR WINDOWS WITH POSTER BOARD, YOU CAN CHOOSE TO DO THAT. GENERALLY PEOPLE LIKE WINDOWS.
01:05:42.422: >> Commissioner Abrons:  MORE LIKE BUSINESSES.
01:05:45.358: >> Planning Manager:  FOR BUSINESSES THEY DO HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THATERN INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR WINDOW SIGNAGE WITHIN THAT 25%. THAT GIVES THEM SOME FLEXIBILITY. FRANKLY AT TIMES IT MAY COME DOWN TO SIGNAGE vs. ART JUDGMENT.
01:06:01.508: >> Commissioner Abrons:  IS THERE A REASON WHY WINDOWS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE TEMPORARY -- TEMPORARY SAYS FREE STANDING WALL THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE WINDOW.
01:06:11.351: >> Planning Manager:  I THINK IT'S BECAUSE WE ARE PROVIDING SOME FLEXIBILITY FOR NONRESIDENTIAL WINDOWS FLATLY WITHOUT BEING A TEMPORARY SIGN.
01:06:21.895: >> Commissioner Abrons:  I SEE. OKAY. THANK YOU.
01:06:27.868: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT.
01:06:30.537: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: THANKS. WELL, FIRST OF ALL, I WOULD BE TOTALLY OKAY WITH THE CHANGE TO 30 MINUTES. BEFORE AND AFTER BUSINESS HOURS JUST FOR THE RECORD. I THINK IT MAKES YOUR POINT, COMMISSIONER MILLS ABOUT TURNING OFF LI LIGHTS. I WANTED TO TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE PERMANENT WALL SIGNS. BASED A LOT ON THE CORRESPONDENCE THAT WE GOT, PRIOR TO THIS MEETING -- WE HAVE BEEN SPECIFICALLY TALKING ABOUT THESE PROPERTY MANAGEMENT SIGNS. IS THERE EVER, BESIDES AN HISTORIC DISTRICT SIGN ANOTHER INSTANCE OF A PERMANENT WALL SIGN ON SOMEBODY'S RESIDENCE? CAN WE THINK OF ANY OTHER REASONS WHY WE NEED TO HAVE THIS IN THE FIRST PLACE? WE IT WASN'T IN AND THEN WE BROUGHT IT BACK.
01:07:33.200: >> Planning Manager:  I DON'T KNOW. IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THERE COULD BE SOME INSTANCE OF A HOME OCCUPATION THAT HAS A SMALL SEEN, ALTHOUGH WE HAVE SOME LIMITATIONS ON THAT OUR CURRENT ORDINANCE. IT COULD BE A -- I DON'T KNOW, IT COULD BE A PARSONAGE ASSOCIATED WITH A CHURCH THAT'S A RESIDENTIAL CHURCH AND NOT NECESSARILY A NONRESIDENTIAL ASPECT OF THAT. SO I WOULD GUESS THEY ARE OUT THERE BUT I DON'T HAVE A SENSE OF QUANTITY FOR A FULL RANGE OF EXAMPLES.
01:08:11.338: >> IN YOUR OPINION, DO YOU THINK IT WOULD DO US MORE HARM THAN GOOD TO SAY YOU CAN'T HAVE A PERMANENT SIGN ON A RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY, PERIOD?
01:08:21.481: >> Planning Manager:  I LIKE -- MY PREFERENCE IS TO ALLOW A SMALL SIGN ON A RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY SO YOU CAN PUT UP AN HISTORIC PLAQUE. THIS IS THE HAMMERSCHMIDT HOUSE. YOU -- WE ARE PROVIDING A MODEST OPPORTUNITY FOR SOME SIGNAGE. TO NOT PROVIDE IT IS SPECIFICALLY LIMITING EVERYTHING TO TEMPORARY SIGNAGE AND I THINK THE MODESTY OF ONE SQUARE FEET SSEEMS LIKE A VERY REASONABLE BALANCE. I DON'T HAVE A DESIRE TO GO ADD A SIGN TO MY HOUSE IF THAT'S POSSIBLE. YOU CAN DO UP TO A 3 SQUARE FOOT SIGN ON YOUR HOME. IT'S LIMITED TO THE ADDRESS AND THE NAME OF THE OCCUPANTS. AND, AGAIN, TOWARDS THE GOAL OF WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO SEE WHAT'S ON THE SIGN TO UNDERSTAND IF IT'S PERMISSIBLE OR NOT. I THINK THIS IS AS PRO E POSED,S A REASONABLE BALANCE.
01:09:40.960: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: I TAKE THE POINT -- I LIVED IN ONE OF THESE NEIGHBORHOODS IN COLLEGE. ALMOST EVERY SINGLE HOUSE HAS A PROPERTY MANAGEMENT TIME AND MAANDMAYBE ALEX AS HAS AN OPININ IT. I DON'T KNOW THAT I WOULD WANT TO MOVE IN AN AREA WHERE THERE'S TONS OF RENTALS. I DON'T KNOW. THAT POINT RESONATED WITH ME. AND THEN WHAT COMMISSIONER ABRONS BROUGHT UP THAT YOU COULD HAVE THE SIX-UNIT BUILDINGS OR HOUSED DIVIDED INTO SIX UNITS, DOES THAT MAKE THEM ELIGIBLE FOR BIGGER SIGNS? THESE ARE ALL OF A SUDDEN THAT ARE BROUGHT UP FOR ME. I DON'T KNOW IF THEY ARE CONCERNS OR NOT. MY OTHER QUESTION WAS ABOUT THE GRANDFATHERING OF NON-CONFORMING SIGNS SIGNS. IS THERE ANYTHING IN THERE?
01:10:43.356: >> Planning Manager: THAT'S GOING TO BE TO HAPPEN. WE WILL BE CREATING NON-CONFORMITY AND THE WAY ZONING WORKS AND SIGNAGE WORKS BE PART OF THE UDC IS THAT IF A SIGN IS PERMITTED NOW, IF YOU ARE ALLOWED TO HAVE PAY 3 SQUARE FOOT SIGN ON YOUR HOUSE NOW THAT HAS THE NAME OF YOUR FAMILY AND THE ADDRESS, AND WE CHANGE THAT TO SAY YOU CAN'T HAVE A SIGN THERE, THAT GOES INTO THE NON-CONFORMING STANDARDS WHERE YOU CAN MAINTAIN IT, BUT YOU CANNOT REPLACE IT. YOU CAN'T EXPAND IT. IF YOU SEEK A SIGN PERMIT TO UPDATE THAT, IT WILL HAVE TO BE FULLY COMPLIANCE WITH THE NEW STANDARDS AND SO THIS WILL APPLY BROADLY NOT ONLY TO THAT CIRCUMSTANCE BUT IF IT WERE A PROJECTING SIGN THAT WAS THE SIGN WENT AWAY FOR A PERIOD OF TIME AND IT PROJECTED TOO FAR INTO THE PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY. THE SAME THING WOULD APPLY. SOME OF THEM MAY BE NON-CONFORMING AND THAT HAPPENS AS WELL, BUT THAT'S WHERE WE DO OUR BEST WHEN WE ARE FACED WITH, THAT WE DO OUR BEST TO DO AN INVESTIGATION AND MAKE A DETERMINATION OF WHERE TO GO FROM THERE, BUT AS FAR AS THE TERM GRANDFATHERING AND ZONING SPEAK IS LEGALLY NON-CONFORMING. IT'S ALLOWED NOW. WE CHANGED SOMETHING. YOU DON'T HAVE TO INSTANTLY COMPLY, BUT YOU WILL BE LIMITED IN YOUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN THAT IN THE FUTURE.
01:12:25.959: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: IS THERE EVER A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE YOU CAN BE LEGAL AND NON-CONFORMING AND THEN YOU HAVE TO GET WITH THE PROGRAM?
01:12:37.203: >> Planning Manager:  I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY LEGAL BASIS TO DO THAT.
01:12:41.274: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: ALL RIGHT.
01:12:42.609: >> Planning Manager:  THINK ABOUT AN EXTREME EXAMPLE OF THAT. YOUR HOUSE -- WE REQUIRE YOUR HOUSE TO BE 10 FEET SETBACK FROM YOUR NEIGHBOR. AND YOU BUILD IT. AND THEN WE ADOPT SOMETHING THAT SAYS, WE NOW REQUIRE YOUR HOUSE TO BE 15 FEET SETBACK. THE CASE LAW THAT SAYS WE HAVE TO BUILD NOW, AND NOW YOU HAVE TO LOP OFF 5 FEET OF YOUR HOUSE.
01:13:07.734: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: THAT'S FAIR. THANKS.
01:13:11.070: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL.
01:13:12.272: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: I'M WONDERING WHAT -- WITH THE SEASONAL WINDOW PAINTING THAT HAPPENS. HOW DOES THAT FALL INTO THIS? MOST OF THEM ARE A SCENE, AND SOMESOMETIMES WE HAVE WORDS ON . I WONDER IF THERE'S ANY LANGUAGE TO COVER THAT. IS IT OKAY TO HAVE YOUR CHRISTMAS THING UP STILL IN JULY? YOU KNOW --
01:13:48.141: >> Planning Manager:  YOU CAN HAVE YOUR TEMPORARY CHRISTMAS SIGN UP, AS LONG AS IT'S MEETING THE TEMPORARY SIGN PROVISION. MOST OF THEM ARE WAY BIGGER THAN THAT.
01:14:07.527: >> Planning Manager:  IF IT'S A WINDOW PAINTING ON YOUR PUB, IT WILL HAVE TO MEET THE 25% LIMIT AVAILABLE TO NONRESIDENTIAL BUSINESSES. IF IT EXCEEDS THAT, IT WILL START COUNTING INTO YOUR WALL SIGN CALCULATION.
01:14:22.375: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: AH, OKAY.
01:14:25.144: >> Planning Manager:  OR YOU MIGHT HAVE TO PULL OFF THE WORDS AND IT MIGHT HAVE TO BE ART INSTEAD OF A SIGN.
01:14:30.283: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: GOT IT. OKAY. ALL RIGHTY. I WANTED TO KNOW HOW THOSE WOULD FIT.
01:14:35.722: >> Planning Manager:  YOU ARE GOING TO MOST CRITICAL SIGNAGE ISSUES.
01:14:40.727: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: I KNOW, RIGHT. AND FOR THE RECORD, I'M FINE WITH THE 30 MINUTES.
01:14:51.804: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER BRIGGS?
01:14:53.840: >> Commissioner Briggs: I WANTED TO CONTINUE ON THE WALL SIGN ISSUE AROUND -- THAT COMMISSIONER ABRONS RAISED. I HADN'T REALLY FIXATED ON THE FACT THAT WE HAD THIS BROKEN UP. WE HAD ONE OR TWO DWELLING UNITS OR FIVE OR MORE DWELLING UNITS. I THINK THAT'S A LOT OF OUR DISCUSSION PREVIOUSLY AROUND THIS, FOCUSED IN ON TRYING TO ALLOW FOR SOME MODEST, RISING WE CAN'T DO -- RECOGNIZING WE CAN'T DO CONTENT AND PROVIDING FOR A LITTLE BIT OF SPACE FOR WHATEVER CONTENT IS NEEDED, BUT I'M WONDERING IF THERE WOULD BE INTEREST FROM AREAS ABOUT CHANGING THOSE NUMBERS SO THAT BUILDINGS WITH EIGHT UNITS ARE MORE -- TO ME, THAT SEEMS LIKE IT'S STARTING TO MOVE INTO A SLIGHTLY LARGER BUILDING MIGHT HAVE THE 6 SQUARE FEET BUT THAT SMALLER THAN THAT, AND MAYBE WHAT THAT SIZE IS, IF THERE'S OTHER INTEREST AROUND THAT, WOULD STILL BE THAT ONE SQUARE FOOT. SO THAT WE'RE PROVIDING FOR THAT SPACE BUT RECOGNIZING THAT 6 SQUARE FEET IS PRETTY LARGE WHEN YOU ARE TALKING THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE DISTRICTS. YEAH. THE STUDENT DISTRICT. I DON'T KNOW. I WOULD BE -- I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN CHANGING THOSE RATIOS. I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S OTHER INTEREST.
01:16:32.171: >> Chair Milshteyn: I WOULD BE IN FAVOR OF THAT. I WOULD PROBABLY SAY SIX UNITS OR MORE. THE REASON FOR THAT, USUALLY THE RESIDENTIAL HOUSES THAT HAVE BEEN CONVERTED TO MULTIPLE UNITS. VERY RARELY DO I SEE MORE THAN SIX IN THOSE. IF IT'S SIX OR MORE, THEN IT'S THE APARTMENT-LOOKING BUILDINGS THAT WE SEE AROUND TOWN. SO INSTEAD OF EIGHT, I WOULD BE IN FAVOR AND I WOULD SUPPORT SIX OR MORE. COMMISSIONER ABRONS.
01:17:03.269: >> Commissioner Abrons:  DO YOU MEAN SEVEN OR MORE. SO ONE THROUGH SIX WOULD BE ONE SQUARE FOOT AND SEVEN AND UP WOULD BE THE SIX SQUARE FEET. I WOULD SUPPORT THAT.
01:17:16.582: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER SAUVE.
01:17:19.152: >> Commissioner Sauve: I MEAN, I WOULD BE IN SUPPORT OF THAT. I'M WONDERING IF IT'S LIKE ONE SQUARE FOOT PER DWELLING UNIT AND MAXIMUM 6 SQUARE FEET. IT SIG KIND OF SKIMS IT BETWEENE TWO. SO I UNDERSTAND THE SPLITTING OF HOUSES. IT'S JUST AN ACCOMMODATION, JUST A DIRECT SCALE OF UNITS. SO SO, ONE, TWO, THREE, FOR FIVE, UP TO SIX FEET. IT COULD BE ANOTHER WAY TO DO IT. IT ALLOWED EACH DWELLING UNIT A 1 SQUARE FOOT SIGN EITHER THE RENTAL OR A HOMEOWNER IN A DUPLEX, LIKE IT MIGHT BE A CONDO THAT IT JUST EACH UNIT GETS 1 SQUARE FOOT. AND YOU SNOW YOU KNOW, I THINK S BETWEEN RENTALS AND HOMEOWNERSHIP. AND WHAT THAT -- THAT IMPLICIT BIAS MIGHT BE, ONE FOR UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU MIGHT BE IN A RENTAL NEIGHBORHOOD, OR IT'S PRO PS OR CONS DEPENDING ON YOUR BIAS. AND WHEN YOU HAVE THE NAMES OF SIGNS IS IT ADVERTISING OR DEPENDING ON THE CONDITIONS OF THE BUILDI BUILDING, IS IT ACTUA RED FLAG IS IT REVERSE ADVERTISING FOR SOME OF THESE LANDLORDS. I'M MIXED BAGS IN TERMS ABOUT WHAT IT SAYS FOR THE NEIGHBORHOOD OR OWNERSHIP, BUT THAT KIND OF ONE SQUARE FOOT PER UNIT GIVES EACH UNIT ITS OWN PERMANENT SPACE.
01:19:32.618: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL.
01:19:34.086: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: I COULD SEE THAT LOOKING CLUTTERED, LIKE FIVE OR SIX OVER THE WHOLE BUILDING, FEELS LIKE -- MY IMMEDIATE GUT REACTION IS T THAT IT'S TOO MAN. IT'S USUALLY I WOULD IMAGINE IF IT IS A HOUSE THAT HAS SIX UNITS IN IT, IT'S ONE -- IT'S OWNED BY ONE PERSON. IT'S NOT, YOU KNOW, SPLIT UP INTO I'M WONDERING IF IT'S MORE BASED ON OWNERS SO WE DON'T GET LOTS OF ADVERTISERS EVEN IF IT'S SMALL.
01:20:03.716: >> Planning Manager:  AS IT'S CURRENTLY WRITTEN, YOU WOULD ONLY GET ONE SIGN, STRUCTURED WALL SIGN. SO I THINK THE QUESTION WOULD BE SIZE OF THAT SIGN. SO -- GIBB BUT I THOUGHT COMMISSIONER SAUVE WAS USING IT PER UNIT.
01:20:21.767: >> Commissioner Sauve: SO YOU GET JUST MORE SQUARE FOOTAGE. AND EVERYONE GETS A SQUARE FOOT.
01:20:27.106: >> Planning Manager:  IT COULD STILL BE CLUTTERED. TO THAT END IF IT WAS P MANIFESD IS EACH UNIT WOULD GET A SQUARE FOOT. IT WOULD HAVE TO BE ON A 6-FOOT SQUARE PANEL.
01:20:38.484: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: I SEE. I SEE WHAT YOU ARE SAYING.
01:20:55.368: >> Vice Chair Mills: I LIKE HAVING TO UNIT, BUT BECAUSE WE ONLY HAVE THE ONE, I DON'T SEE HOW THAT, LIKE -- I DON'T SEE HOW THAT PUT INTO PRACTICE WOULD LOOK -- WOULD, BENEFICIAL. LIKE, DEN AND SO I THINK I -- I LIKE THIS IDEA OF SAYING IF YOU ARE 1 TO 6 UNITS YOU GET ONE AND IT'S A SQUARE FOOT AND AFTER THAT, YOU GO UP TO THE NEXT LEVEL. THE POINT I WANT TO BRING UP. AS WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS, I WAS THINKING ABOUT THIS IS LARGELY BEEN ABOUT PERMANENT SIGNS. I KNOW WE HAVE THIS DISCUSSION PREVIOUSRPREVIOUSLY ABOUT THE TY SIGNS AND THE PEOPLE IN THE MULTIFAMILY -- IN MULTIFAMILY UNITS OR DWELLINGS TO BE ABLE TO PUT A -- A -- YOU KNOW, A POLITICAL SIGN OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN THEIR WINDOW. AND SO WHEN I JUST NOW WENT BACK AND READ THE TEMPORARY SIGNS, IT SEEMS LIKE WE ARE NOT ALLOWING FOR -- THAT WE WOULDN'T ALLOW FOR THAT, THAT IF THERE WERE EIGHT UNITS IN THE BUILDING, THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE EIGHT TEMPORARY WINDOW SIGNS; IS THAT CORRECT?
01:22:10.076: >> Planning Manager:  IF IT'S RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY, YOU COULD HAVE AN INTERIOR WINDOW SIGN. THERE'S NO LIMIT ON THE NUMBER OR THE SIZE OF INTERIOR RESIDENTIAL WINDOW SIGNS. SO ON AN EIGHT-UNIT, ALL EIGHT RESIDENTS COULD PUT, YOU KNOW, VOLT FOR CHRIS CHANG FOR PRESIDENT ON -- IN THEIR WINDOWS.
01:22:32.965: >> Vice Chair Mills: GOT IT. IT'S JUST THE WALL SIGNS, THE TEMPORARY WALL SIGNS OR TEMPORARY FREE STANDING SIGNS WHERE THERE'S A LIMIT ON THE NUMBER AND IT'S STILL SCALED AND ACTUALLY TO BE CLEAR, FOR THAT SECOND -- THE TEMPORARY SIGNS, WE SCALE THAT BY THE ZONING DISTRICT, NOT THE USE WITHIN THAT ZONING DISTRICT AS WE HAVE ON THE PERMANENT SIGNS; IS THAT RIGHT?
01:22:57.289: >> Planning Manager:  YES, AND WE SCALE IT BY ZONING DISTRICT, NOT BY USE, BUT WE ALSO SCALE IT BY THE SIZE OF THE BUSINESS FOR THE FRONTAGE.
01:23:09.502: >> Vice Chair Mills: RIGHT. OKAY. THANKS. THE WINDOW THING -- RIGHT, THE INTERIOR WINDOW SIGNS ARE THE ONES THAT ALLEVIATES MY KIND OF CONCERN THAT I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WAS STILL THERE. AND MY PRIMARY COMMENT IS TO CHIME IN SAYING, I THINK ONE SQUARE FOOT FOR UP TO -- UP TO -- OR THROUGH SIX UNITS IS APPROPRIATE FOR A PERMANENT WALL SIGN.
01:23:50.009: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT.
01:23:51.043: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: I WILL SHOW MY BIAS. WHAT IF YOU HAVE A DUPLEX AND EACH -- AND THEY ARE LIKE CONDOIZED AND THEY EACH WANTED A WELCOME SIGN BY THEIR FRONT DOOR:  THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DO THAT RIGHT, BECAUSE THAT'S TWO SIGNS? OKAY. THEY PROBABLY WOULD ANYWAY BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T NECESSARILY KNOW, BUT I MEAN -- I THINK I'M THINKING OF VERY EXTREME EXAMPLES OF THIS. I'M GENERALLY FINE WITH THE REALLY SMALL SIGN ON A BUILDING UP TO SIX UNITS OR UP TO SEVEN UNITS.
01:24:28.080: >> Commissioner Sauve: WELCOME IS NOT OFFENSIVE ENOUGH TO GET ENFORCED. (LAUGHTER).
01:24:33.419: >> Planning Manager:  THAT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A CONCERN OF MINE FROM ENFORCEMENT PERSPECTIVE AND IF I HAD TO GUESS IN MANY CIRCUMSTANCES, THOSE ARE PROBABLY GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT IS MORE OF AN APPLICATION HANGING THING THAN A PERMANENT HANGING SIGN.
01:24:51.704: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: I DON'T KNOW. I WOULD NEVER HANG ANYTHING LIKE THAT PERSONALLY.
01:24:56.008: >> YOU WOULD NEVER SAY WELCOME?
01:24:58.010: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: IT'S THE FAIRNESS ASPECT OF YOU GET ONE SIGN PER BUILDING. YOU GOT A DUPLEX. LIKE IF YOU BOTH WANT THEM AND THEY ARE BOTH AWARE OF THIS ORDINANCE, WHO GETS IT?
01:25:10.522: >> Planning Manager:  YOU GET ONE SIGN.
01:25:13.559: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: YEAH, FLIP A COIN.
01:25:18.297: >> Chair Milshteyn: SO I GUESS --
01:25:19.064: >> Planning Manager:  I WAS GOING TO REITERATE -- I GOT SORT OF WHAT I'M HEARING.
01:25:24.670: >> Chair Milshteyn: NO, I STILL HAVE A COUPLE OF OTHER THINGS TO TALK ABOUT.
01:25:27.840: >> Planning Manager:  OKAY.
01:25:29.575: >> Chair Milshteyn: IF THAT'S OKAY. I'M GOOD WITH THE 30 MINUTE VERSUS AN HOUR. I LIKE THE IDEA OF JUST MAKING IT SO THAT IT'S THE SAME ALL THROUGHOUT, THE UDC. WITH REGARDS TO MIXED USE BUILDINGS, I THINK IT'S TABLE 5.24-5. WHEN YOU HAVE A MIXED USE MIXED USINGBUILDING AND MAIN ST, WHERE FIRST FLOOR IS COMMERCIAL AND THE SECOND IS RESIDENTIAL OR ADDITIONAL COMMERCIAL SPACE, IF SOMEONE IS LEASING OR SELLING THE SECOND OR THE THIRD FLOOR, FOR EXAMPLE, YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO PUT A SIGN UP; IS THAT RIGHT?
01:26:14.553: >> Planning Manager:  TO MY UNDERSTANDING, IT'S A MIXED USE PROPERTY AND A UNIT IS FOR SALE OR LEASE.
01:26:20.626: >> Chair Milshteyn: ON THE SECOND FLOOR.
01:26:21.860: >> Planning Manager:  SO THAT PROPERTY COULD HAVE A TEMPORARY WALL SIGN UP TO 20 SQUARE FEET PER BUILDING, UP TO 20 SQUARE FOOT PER SIGN OR HAVE MULTIPLE SIGNS. THEY HAVE TO BE A MAXIMUM OF 10 FEET HIGH AND SUBJECT TO THE 65 FEET OR YOU COULD PLACE AN UNLIMITED SIGN UP TO 3 SQUARE FEET THAT COULD HAVE A COMMERCIAL MESSAGE ON THAT UNIT WHILE IT WAS BEING MARKETED FOR SALE OR LEASE.
01:27:22.388: >> Chair Milshteyn: SO I'M LOOKING AT -- WHAT PAGE A AM I ?
01:27:30.095: >> Planning Manager: TEMPORARY SIGNS.
01:27:32.431: >> Chair Milshteyn: UNDER WINDOW SIGNS. YES, WINDOW SIGNS WHERE IT SAYS MIXED USE NONRESIDENTIAL AND SPECIAL PURPOSE. I GUESS I THINK WHERE I'M CONFUSING IT, THIS IS FOR PERMANENT SIGNAGE; IS THAT RIGHT?
01:27:46.779: >> Planning Manager:  WINDOW SIGNS ARE -- IT'S AN ALLOCATION OF PERMANENT SIGNAGE UP TO A LIMIT. SO -- AND YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT A TEMPORARY SIGN.
01:28:05.431: >> Chair Milshteyn: WELL, I GUESS I'M ALSO LOOKING ALONG THE LINES OF -- LET'S SAY FIRST FLOOR IS A COFFEE SHOP AND ON THE SECOND FLOOR IS A COMPANY, WANTS TO DISPLAY ITS SIGN THAT THEY ARE LOCATED IN THE WINDOW THERE.
01:28:19.778: >> Planning Manager:  THEY COULD DO -- THEY ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO THEIR BUSINESS IN THE SECOND FLOOR WINDOW. THEY COULD GO A WALL SIGN UP TO 20 FEET. OR IF THE BUILDING IS CALLER, THEY COULD DO IT NEAR THE ROOF. APART FROM THAT, IT'S WALL SIGNAGE, AWNING SIGNAGE OR CANOPY SIGNAGE NEAR THE BASE OF THE BUILDING.
01:28:49.007: >> Chair Milshteyn: OKAY. I THINK I'M OKAY WITH THAT. I WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT.
01:28:52.611: >> Planning Manager:  AND IT'S KIND OF TRADITIONALLY HOW IT'S BEEN DONE.
01:29:05.424: >> Chair Milshteyn: AND I APOLOGIZE. WHEN I FIRST STARTED REVIEWING THIS, I READ THE DRAFT THAT WE HAD IN DECEMBER.
01:29:14.266: >> Planning Manager:  MY APOLOGIES.
01:29:22.441: >> Chair Milshteyn: NO, THAT'S OKAY. I DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE TO FINISH IT, OTHER THAN THE STAFF REPORT STATES THAT THERE ARE FOR TEMPORARY SIGNS 12 SQUARE FEET PER SIDE. I DIDN'T SEE 12 SQUARE FEET PER SIDE. I SAW 12 SQUARE FEET PER SIGN. AND I DON'T KNOW IF MAYBE I'M -- I DIDN'T -- AND I RAN OUT OF TIME TO CONTINUE REVIEWING. SO I DON'T KNOW IF I ACTUALLY --
01:29:59.811: >> Planning Manager:  THAT -- I THINK THAT WAS A REFERENCE TO THE PREVIOUS CORRECTION. THAT WAS THE EXCEPTION FOR A BUILDING FOR SALE -- HOLD ON. I THINK IT'S RIGHT.
01:30:36.081: >> Chair Milshteyn: SO THE STAFF REPORT SAYS IT WI TEMPORARY SIGL NOT REQUIRE A SIGN PERMIT. POSTING THESE SIGNS AND THEN THE MAXIMUM SIZE OF THESE SIGNS IS 12 SQUARE FEET PER SIGN. SO IS THE STAFF REPORT INCORRECT OR IS IT THE ORACLE ORDINANCE TS INCORRECT.
01:31:02.975: >> Planning Manager:  I THINK THE STAFF REPORT IS INCORRECT. I THINK THIS WAS A TOPIC OF CONVERSATION AND I APOLOGIZE. I THINK WE KIND OF SPLIT THE BABY OPEN THIS. I CAN'T REMEMBER A CONSENSUS OF THE PLANNING COMMISSION IN ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. AND I THINK WE INACCURATELY REFERENCED BUT IT'S TOTAL SIGNAGE AREA OF 12 SQUARE FEET. THAT'S A MAXIMUM -- IF IT'S TWO SIDES, IT WILL BE SQUARE FEET. I DO REMEMBER A CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW IT RELATES TO THE TYPICAL RESIGN.
01:31:44.583: >> Chair Milshteyn: WHICH TYPICAL IS 18 AND THEN WE HAVE ISSUES WITH SIGN RIDERS POTENTIALLY OF THAT. AND THEN THE STAFF REPORT ALSO SAYS TEMPORARY REAL ESTATE SIGNS WILL NOT REQUIRE A SIGN PERMIT, WHICH IS GREAT.
01:31:58.430: >> Planning Manager:  ALL TEMPORARY SIGNS DO NOT REQUIRE A PERMIT.
01:32:02.734: >> Chair Milshteyn: BUTYLENE IT SAYS AND CANNOT -- BUT THEN IT SAYS AND CANNOT REMAIN FOR LONGER THAN 65 DAYS.
01:32:09.741: >> Planning Manager:  CORRECT.
01:32:12.144: >> Chair Milshteyn: SO A FOR SALE SIGN. I STARTED READING IT -- AND I DIDN'T SEE A MENTION. ONCE AGAIN, I DIDN'T GET A CHANCE -- THE FINAL DRAFT OF -- THAT FOR SALE SIGNS WERE EXEMPT FROM THAT.
01:32:22.954: >> Planning Manager:  THEY ARE NOT. THERE USED TO BE A SPECIFIC EXEMPTION FOR THAT. THEY CHOSE TO STRIKE THE SPECIFIC EXEMPTION FOR REAL ESTATE SIGNS AND HAVE THE UNLIMITED SIGN WHICH SAYS THAT YOU CAN -- SO WE HAVE -- IT'S -- IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR, LIKE, ULTIMATE FREE SPEECH THAT YOU CAN HAVE A 3 SQUARE FOOT SIGN ON A NONCOMMERCIAL MESSAGE THAT IS NOT LIMITED BY THE 65-DAY DURATION. IF IN THE EVENT THAT YOU HAVE A PROPERTY FOR SALE OR LEASE, YOU GET TO ADD A COMMERCIAL MESSAGE TO THAT SIGN, UP TO 3 SQUARE FEET FOR THE DURATION THAT PROPERTY IS FOR SALE OR LEASE. AS IT RELATES TO A FREE STANDING SIGN, REAL ESTATE SIGN, THAT'S -- HOPEFULLY THAT AGENT IS SO GOOD THEY ARE GOING TO SELL IT IN 65 DAYS. AND THAT'S -- THAT'S -- AGAIN, REMEMBER WE ARE NO LONGER DISTINGUISHING A TEMPORARY SIGN FOR REAL ESTATE OR A POLITICAL SIGN OR SAVE THE WHALES. WE ARE PROVIDING CONTENT NEUTRAL REGULATIONS. AND IF' HOUSE IS NOT SOLD IN 65 DAYS, THE SIGN IS PROBABLY NOT DOING IT ANYHOW.
01:33:47.973: >> Chair Milshteyn: UM, I WOULD LIKE TO BUY THAT BUT -- SO THOSE ARE TWO REALLY BIG THINGS THAT I DID NOT GET FROM OUR LAST WORKING SESSION. THAT'S NOT WHAT I WALKED AWAY WITH THAT, YOU KNOW WILL, REAL ESTATE SIGNS WOULD BE PROHIBITED TO 65 DAYS AND THEN YOU HAVE TO MINIMIZE YOURSELF TO 3 SQUARE FOOT. SIGN. SO I WOULD BE -- I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE DEFINITELY NEED TO WORK ON SOME MORE. AND THEN I LIKE THE IDEA OF 12 SQUARE FEET PER SIDE FOR A TEMPORARY SIGN. I THINK 6 SQUARE FEET PER SIDE IS SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO LIMIT AND CAUSE A HUGE PROBLEM AT THE VERY LEAST OR THE REAL ESTATE COMMUNITY. I THINK THOSE TWO THINGS I WOULD NOT BE IN FAVOR OF. I WOULD BE IN FAVOR OF THE TABLING ON IT SO WE CAN FURTHER WORK ON THOSE TWO PIECES.
01:35:01.713: >> Planning Manager:  I REMEMBER WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE HEIGHT OF THOSE SIGNS. WHICH IS RESTRICTED IT TO 5 FEET.
01:35:10.889: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER ABRONS. WHABRONS.
01:35:13.658: >> Commissioner Abrons:  WHAT DID YOU SAY WAS THE --
01:35:17.128: >> Chair Milshteyn: 18 SQUARE FEET.
01:35:19.297: >> Commissioner Abrons:  SO 36 TOTAL --
01:35:22.100: >> Chair Milshteyn: 18 TOTAL.
01:35:25.737: >> Commissioner Abrons:  NINE AND NINE. SO SIX AND SIX IS A 30% REDUCTION.
01:35:32.644: >> Chair Milshteyn: YEP.
01:35:33.178: >> Commissioner Abrons:  OKAY. I GUESS RELATED TO THAT, I WOUNDED -- SO THAT SEEMS QUITE RESTRICTIVE, BUT IT ALSO SAYS YOU CAN HAVE FOUR SIGNS WITHIN ONE LOT WHICH FEELS QUITE GENEROUS. IT'S NOT REAL ESTATE SPECIFIC. I'M THINKING ABOUT WILL BE HAVING FOUR TWO BY THREE SIGNS IN THEIR FRONT YARD.
01:36:04.009: >> Planning Manager:  THAT INTENTION IS ALSO TO PROVIDE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY YOU WANT TO SUPPORT A CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT, FOR SENATOR, FOR STATE REPRESENTATIVE AND YOU WANT TO HAVE FOUR OPPORTUNITIES.
01:36:20.058: >> Commissioner Abrons: ORACLE I HAVE FOUR KIDS AND THEY ALL PLAY VARSITY SPORTS. YEAH, I GET IT. I GET IT.
01:36:31.970: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT.
01:36:33.505: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: I DON'T REMEMBER THE CONVERSATION THAT WE HAD A COUPLE OF MONTHS GOING THAT WAY. BUT I ALSO DON'T FULLY REMEMBER BECAUSE I KNOW IT WAS RIGHT AS COVID WAS HAPPENING. BUT I -- THAT IS NOT HOW I REMEMBER THAT CONVERSATION EITHER. IT COULD JUST BE ME AND ALEX.
01:36:54.759: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER WOODS AND COMMISSIONER I WILL MILLS.
01:36:58.363: >> Commissioner Woods: I JUST HAD A QUESTION AND I WOULD LIKE MORE MAYBE MORE THOUGHT AND DISCUSSION ABOUT IT. AND SO IF WE ARE LOOKING TO POSTPONE THIS TONIGHT, I THINK I COULD VOTE IN FAVOR OF THAT. COMMISSIONER MILSHTEYN, I WANTED TO ASK ABOUT AN EXAMPLE THAT YOU RAISED BEFORE YOU STARTED TALKING ABOUT THE SIGN SIZE AND YOU GAVE THE EXAMPLE OF A MIXED USE BUILDING WITH A BUSINESS ON THE FIRST FLOOR, WITH -- IS IT RESIDENTIAL ON THE WILL SECOND FLOOR OR A DIFFERENT BUSINESS ON THE SECOND FLOOR.
01:37:38.203: >> Chair Milshteyn: I WAS ASKING IN BOTH.
01:37:40.138: >> Commissioner Woods: AND IN EITHER CASE, MR. LENART, WERE YOU SAYING THAT THOSE BUSINESSES WOULD BE LIMITED TO ONE SIGN ON THE LOWER FLOOR BECAUSE I WAS THINK -- THE REASON WHY I ASKED, IT JUST OCCURRED TO ME IN SOME PLACES IT COULD BE A BOOKSTORE ON THE FIRST FLOOR AND THE LAW OFFICE ON THE SECOND FLOOR. WOULD THE LAW OFFICE BE RESTRICTED FROM PUTTING UP A SIGN ADVERTISING OR THE SECOND FLOOR OR HOW WOULD THAT WORK?
01:38:14.672: >> Planning Manager:  THEY COULD JOIN A WALL SIGN ON THE FIRST FLOOR. THEY COULD DO SIGNAGE OR LETTERING ON THE WINDOW OR DOOR. THEY COULD DO AN INDEPENDENT WALL SIGN ON THE BILLING, AS LONG AS IT DID NOT EXCEED A HEIGHT OF 20 FEET.
01:38:31.189: >> Commissioner Woods: OKAY.
01:38:31.790: >> Planning Manager:  AND IF THEY WERE IN A BUILDING THAT EXCEEDED 45 FEET IN HEIGHT. THEY COULD PUT A WALL SIGN OR PROJECTING SIGN WITHIN THE TOP 15 FEET OF THE TOP OF THE BUILDING. BUT IF THEY WERE IN A 10-STORY BUILDING, AND THEY WERE ON FLOOR 5, THEY WOULD NO NOT HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO PUT SIGNAGE RIGHT ON THEIR SPACE.
01:39:01.920: >> Commissioner Woods: THAT MAKES SENSE. IT WOULD BE HARD FOR SOMEBODY TO SEE ABOVE A COUPLE STORIES ANYWAYS IF YOU ARE WALKING DOWN THE STREET. I NEEDED TO GET SOME CLARIFICATION ABOUT THAT. AND THEN JUST IN TERMS OF THE DILEMMA WITH THE REAL ESTATE SIGNS AND EVERYTHING, I COULD I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD MAKE IT MORE RESTRICTIVE FOR FOLKS WOULD ARE SELLING IT REAL ESTATE. SO I THINK THE MATH I JUST HEARD WE WOULD BE GOING WITH A 30% DECREASE IN TERMS THE SIGNAGE AVAILABLE IF WE WENT WITH WHAT WAS ON THE ABLE, I THINK, I WOULD NOT WANT TO MAKE IT A DECREASE IN THE SIZE BUT IF WE COULD FIGURE THAT OUT, I WOULD BE WILLING TO LISTEN TO MORE DISCUSSION. AND LIKE I SAID, IF IT GOES TO A POSTPONEMENT, THAT WOULD BE FINE WITH ME. THANKS.
01:40:02.981: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER MILLS AND THEN COMMISSIONER BRIGGS.
01:40:07.318: >> Vice Chair Mills: I THOUGHT I WOULD CHIME IN, I ALSO -- FIRST OF ALL, CH THANK YOU, COMMISSIOR MILSHTEYN FOR LOOKING OVER THAT SECTION AND REMINDING US WHAT THE NORM IS. I REMEMBER ENDING THE WORKING SESSION EFFECTIVELY WITH THE FEELING THAT NONE OF US THOUGHT IT MADE SENSE FOR REALTORS TO REDO THEIR SIGNS. SO NOT MAKING THEM NON-CONFORMING OUT OF THE GATE, I THOUGHT WAS THE INTENTION, BUT ALSO RECOGNIZING THE TRADEOFFS THAT NOT WANTING TO UNLEASH LIKE ALL KINDS OF OTHER SIGNAGE AND SO I THINK THAT WHERE WE -- I THOUGHT WHERE WE ENDED THAT WAS THIS IDEA OF LIKE, WELL, MAYBE THAT IT'S A DOUBLE SIDED THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY THERE ABOUT LIMITING THE OVERALL SIZE OF ANY ONE SIGN BUT IT WOULD COUNT AS TWO SIDES. I KIND OF THOUGHT THAT'S WHERE WE ENDED IT, BUT, AGAIN, THE THREE MONTHS THAT HAS TRANSPIRED HAS FELT LIKE THREE YEARS IN MY MIND WITH NOT ENOUGH SLEEP. SO I WELCOME OTHER'S THOUGHTS BUT I WOULD BE THE THIRD IN LINE TO SAY THAT THERE WOULD BE A WHOLE BUNCH OF, WELL, SCRAMBLING, NON-CONFORMITIES FOR HOUSES THAT WENT ON THE MARKET. I WOULD BE IN FAVOR OF POSTPONING IT TO GET IT SORTS OUT IF THAT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THAT'S POSSIBLE AT THE TABLE RIGHT NOW.
01:41:50.088: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER BRIGGS.
01:41:54.125: >> Commissioner Briggs: IN AN EFFORT TO NOT POSTPONE. WHERE I REMEMBER THE CONVERSATION GETTING -- LEAVING OFF WAS WE DIDN'T WANT TO FORCE A REDUCTION IN THE SIZE OF REAL ESTATE SIGNS BUT I THOUGHT WE ALSO DIDN'T EXACTLY -- THERE WASN'T NECESSARY DESIRE TO ALLOW THEM TO GROW BIGGER FROM WHERE THEY ARE AT. SO IN THE SIGNS CURRENTLY ARE 18, IT SEEMS LIKE COULD WE MEET THAT STANDARD. IT WOULD BE 9 SQUARE FEET PER SIDE, RIGHT?
01:42:35.600: >> Planning Manager:  WELL, THERE'S NO -- LET ME JUST -- IF I COULD. CURRENTLY -- BRIG YEAH.
01:42:41.639: >> Planning Manager:  THE REAL ESTATE SIGNS NOW DON'T HAVE A SIZE CAP CURRENTLY.
01:42:47.378: >> Commissioner Briggs: YEAH.
01:42:48.012: >> Planning Manager:  REAL ESTATE SIGNS SPECIFICALLY. THERE'S NO AREA CAP OR LIMIT -- THAT 18 SQUARE FOOT IS A CONVENTION OF THE EXPERIENCE OF WHAT MOST OF THEM ARE. THE CURRENT ORDINANCE IS 48 INCHES AND MAXIMUM WIDTH OF 63 INCHES AND 6 INCHES OFF THE GROUND. THIS IS FOR ONE AND TWO FAMILY REAL ESTATE THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
01:43:24.882: >> Commissioner Briggs: OKAY. SO I WANTED TO -- IT'S NOT -- I DON'T THINK IT'S SO MUCH OF A QUESTION GOING BACK TO WHAT A CURRENT STANDARD IS. I THINK THIS IS A QUESTION OF HOW WE WANT TO ACCOMMODATE A CONVENTION THAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. AND THAT'S PART OF THE INTENTION HERE. HOW DO WE WANT TO ACCOMMODATE IT.
01:43:52.977: >> Commissioner Briggs: I WAS LOOKING AT THE LANGUAGE FROM THE DECEMBER DRAFT. SINCE WE HAVE THAT IN FRONT OF US, I WONDER IF IT MAKES SENSE, BBASED ON THE SIGN ORDINANCES, THERE'S ALWAYS AN EXCEPTION FOR PROPERTIES FOR SALE AND LEASE, BECAUSE IN EVERY SINGLE COMMUNITY, THIS IS AN ISSUE. AND SO IT -- PULLING BACK IN THAT LANGUAGE, FROM THE DECEMBER WHERE THERE WAS AN EXEMPTION FOR PROPERTIES THAT WERE FOR SALE, THE EXCEPTION, IT SAYS, YOU KNOW, WHEN ALL OR A PORTION OF THE BUILDING, IT WAS ADVERTISED -- ANYWAY, THAT EXCEPTION, I WONDER IF WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO PULL THAT BACK. PULL THAT BACK IN, IF THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE. IF THAT WOULD JUST RESOLVE THE ISSUE OF HAVING TO -- IF THOSE ARE THE TWO ISSUES IF THERE WAS CONSENSUS AROUND IT, IF WE JUST MIGHT BE ABLE TO MOVE IT FORWARD.
01:44:55.006: >> Planning Manager:  IT WOULD ADDRESS THE TIMING AND NO LONGER RESTRICT THE DURATION OF A REAL ESTATE SIGN TO 65 DAYS. IT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING TO CHANGE THE CURRENT MAXIMUM SIZE. SO THERE'S A DESIRE TO DO THAT, I THINK THAT IT -- THE -- PROBABLY THE WAY TO DO THAT WOULD BE TO MODIFY THE TEMPORARY SIGN TABLE TO ALLOW A MAXIMUM OF UP TO 18 SQUARE FEET IF THAT WAS THE DESIRE FOR ALL TEMPORARY SIGNS. YOU WOULD BE CHANGING THE SORT OF AREA THAT EVERY PROPERTY HAS TO PLAY WITH FOR -- THERE WOULD BE LIMITED TO THE NUMBER OF SIGNS BUT A 60-FOOT LOT COULD HAVE UP TO 18 SQUARE FEET INSTEAD OF 12 SQUARE FEET AND THEN LARGER LOTS COULD STILL HAVE UP TO 28 SQUARE FEET AND SO ON DOWN THE TABLE.
01:45:47.558: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER ABRONS.
01:45:49.694: >> Commissioner Abrons:  I WOULD MAYBE PROPOSE THAT WE THINK ABOUT THE PER SIDE LANGUAGE. SO THE 9 SQUARE FEET PER SIDE MAXIMUM FOR SIGNS, SO THAT YOU DON'T ALLOW THE OPPORTUNITY FOR 18 SQUARE FOOT ONE-SIDED SIGNS ON A RESIDENTIAL LOT. SO IT MAY HAVE BEEN A TYPO IN THE STAFF REPORT BUT MAYBE IT MAKES SENSE FOR IT TO BE -- YEAH, 9 SQUARE FEET PER SIDE AS OPPOSED TO 18 SQUARE FEET PER SIGN.
01:46:24.896: >> Planning Manager:  I REMEMBER THIS QUESTION. I WANT TO BE CLEAR I'M UNDERSTANDING. IN THE CASE OF TEMPORARY SIGNS WE WOULD MEASURE THEM DIFFERENTLY THAN WE DO EVER OTHER SIGN. SO EVERY OTHER SIGN IN THE ORDINANCE, WE MEASURE IF IT'S TWO-FACED, YOU MEASURE BOTH SIDES AND IN THIS CASE, WHAT WE ARE SAYING IS FOR ALL OF THESE STANDARDS HERE, FOR TEMPORARY SIGNS, WE ARE ONLY MEASURING ONE, THE OVERALL SIZE OF THAT. SO EFFECTIVELY, YOU COULD HAVE POTENTIALLY UP TO DOUBLE THE ARE SQUARE FOOTAGE. WHY IS THAT PREFERRABLE TO INCREASING THE CAP TO 18 SQUARE FEET?
01:47:01.132: >> Commissioner Abrons:  I THINK I MIS -- THEN I'M MISUNDERSTANDING -- MAYBE I MISUNDERSTAND THE REGULATIONS. SO CURRENTLY YOU CAN HAVE FOUR SIGNS TOTAL.
01:47:11.676: >> Planning Manager:  YEP.
01:47:12.777: >> Commissioner Abrons:  EACH ONE CAN BE 12 SQUARE FEET TOTAL.
01:47:15.746: >> Planning Manager:  NO, YOU CAN HAVE A MAXIMUM OF UP TO 12 SQUARE FEET. YOU CAN CHOOSE TO DO ALL -- YOU CAN DO ONE 12-FOOT SQUARE SIGN OR THREE FOUR-SQUARE FOOT SIGNS.
01:47:28.159: >> Commissioner Abrons:  IT SAYS 12 SQUARE FEET PER SIGN MAXIMUM --
01:47:33.064: >> Planning Manager:  MAXIMUM SIGN. BUT THE MAXIMUM IS PER LOT. SO IF A RESIDENTIAL LOT IS 60 FEET OR LESS, YOU GET 12 SQUARE FEET OF SIGNAGE.
01:47:49.647: >> Commissioner Abrons: THAT'S CONFUSING TO ME.
01:47:53.284: >> Commissioner Sauve: THE UPPER TITLE AND THEN UNDER THE MAXIMUM SIGN AREA, PER LOT AND PER SIGN, IS THE SUBTITLES BETWEEN THOSE TWO.
01:48:01.092: >> Commissioner Abrons:  I SEE. OKAY. SO THEN, YES, I WAS MISUNDERSTANDING. I THOUGHT IT WAS 12 PER SIGN. IF --
01:48:09.834: >> Councilmember Bannister: IT COULD BE ONE SIGN AT 12.
01:48:14.005: >> Commissioner Abrons: RIGHT, BUT THAT'S LESS -- THAT'S NOT -- WHEN I WAS I  IMAGINING WHICH WAS 12 SQUARE FOOT SIGNS AND JUMPING TO 18 SQUARE FOOT SIGNS. THERE COULD BE ONE 18 SQUARE FOOT SIGN, OR ONE TWO-SIDED 9 FEET ON EACH IF WE AMEND.
01:48:34.458: >> Planning Manager:  YES.
01:48:36.560: >> Commissioner Abrons:  OKAY. OKAY. I'M SORRY, I MISUNDERSTOOD.
01:48:40.331: >> Planning Manager:  OR IT COULD BE AMENDED TO SAY THAT MAXIMUM OF 18 SQUARE FEET, BUT A FREE STANDING SIGN. WE COULD TRY TO MEASURE THAT SO YOU -- WE COULD LIMIT POTENTIALLY A WALL SIGN FROM BEING 18 SQUARE FEET, BUT NOT A FREE STANDING SIGN. BUT UNDER THAT CIRCUMSTANCE TOO, YOU HAVE GOT TO ALSO RECOGNIZE THEN THAT THAT PROBABLY HAS -- IT WOULD PROBABLY -- I DON'T WANT TO SAY -- DEFINITELY NOT, IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN A 2 FEET 9-FOOT SIGN AND 18 SQUARE FOOT SIGN.
01:49:25.242: >> Commissioner Abrons:  YEAH.
01:49:27.044: >> Chair Milshteyn: SO I'M FEELING THAT I THINK THERE'S MAJOR ENOUGH CHANGES TO THIS DOCUMENT THAT WE PROBABLY SHOULD POSTPONE. SO I'M NOT CUTTING OFF DISCUSSION. I WANT TO CONTINUE THE DISCUSSION BUT I'M LEANING TOWARDS A POSTPONEMENT ON THIS RATHER THAN JUST PASSING IT OR AMENDING IT HERE AT THE TABLE. I KNOW IT'S A LONG TIME. I KNOW WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON IT FOR A VERY, VERY LONG TIME AND I'M VERY MUCH IN FAVOR OF GETTING THIS THROUGH, BUT I THINK THERE'S ENOUGH HERE THAT MAY WARRANT A POSTPONEMENT. SO COMMISSIONER MILLS?
01:50:05.249: >> Vice Chair Mills: IN MY MINE, THERE'S A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN -- SO THIS IDEA OF COUNTING TWO SIDES OF THE SIGN REALLY ONLY APPLIES TO FREE STANDING SIGNS, RIGHT? IF IT'S WALL MOUNTED -- IF IT'S -- LIKE, NOTHING ELSE HAS TWO SIDES. AND FOR FREE STANDING SIGNS THERE'S A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN MY MINE THAT 18 SQUARE FEET THAT'S JUST ONE SIDE OF SQUARE AND 9 SQUARE FOOT SIGN THAT HAS TEXT OPEN BOTH SIDES. LIKE HUGE DIFFERENCE IN HOW WE EXPERIENCE IT. AND SO I WOULD BE IN FAVOR OF THE -- I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE NOT ALLOWING ADDITIONAL -- YOU KNOW -- THE IDEA OF 18 SQUARE FEET OF ADVERTISING OR OF TEXT. LIKE, I DON'T WANT TO CHANGE THAT, BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY ENCOURAGE DOUBLE SIDED FREE STANDING SIGNS, RATHER THAN GIGANTIC SINGLE-SIDED BANNERS IS WAY BETTER, WHETHER WE ARE TALKING TEMPORARY SIGNS OR PERMANENT. I GOT TO GO BACK AND SEE WHAT PERM NEXT FREE STANDING SIGNS. EVEN PERMANENT FREE STANDING SIGNS. SO, LIKE, I WOULD -- THIS IS ANOTHER REASON THAT THE MORE I E TALK ABOUT THIS, THIS IS MORE IN KEEPING WHAT WE ARE AFTER, I DON'T WANT TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF ADVERTISING THAT WE HAVE, BUT I THINK ENCOURAGING DOUBLE SIDEDNESS IS BETTER AND SO PUTTING A CAP ON THE -- OR MAKING SMALLER HOW BIG ANY SIDE CAN BE, MAKES A WHOLE LOT MORE SENSE. NOT JUST IN THIS ISSUE. SO.
01:51:53.224: >> Planning Manager:  I UNDERSTAND THAT. I THINK I WOULD DEFINITELY NEED MORE TIME TO EXPLORE THAT. I -- OFF THE CUFF, I'M WORRIED ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTROL THE SIGN AREA THAT YOU CAN -- THAT YOU CAN HAVED. HAVE -- HOWEVER S DONE, I THINK WE HAVE TO PROVIDE A COMPARABLE AMOUNT OF SIGN AREA, THE QUESTION IS:  HOW IS THAT M MANIFESTED. IT MIGHT BE THAT YOU -- EVERYBODY GETS THE SAME AMOUNT, BUT IT MEANS THAT YOU COULD DO TWO WALL SIGNS OR FREESTANDING DOUBLE SIGN OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT NEEDS MORE EXPLANATION. AGAIN, I MY APOLOGIES. I REMEMBER THIS CONVERSATION. I DIDN'T REMEMBER THAT THE PLANNING COMMISSION SORT OF COMES TO A RESOLUTION ON IT, BUT WE CAN DEFINITELY LOOK AT THAT. AND MAYBE -- YOU KNOW, MAYBE THE NEXT PLANNING DIRECTOR CAN DO THIS FOR YOU GUYS.
01:53:05.362: >> Chair Milshteyn: NO, THAT'S NOT AN OPTION. ALL RIGHT. FURTHER DISCUSSION? OR A MOTION -- COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT.
01:53:17.708: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: JUST QUICKLY. SO CAN WE NOT APPLY -- I MEAN, I KIND OF LIKE THE IDEA OF PULLING BACK IN THE LANGUAGE FROM BEFORE, LIKE SEPARATES OUT FOR REAL ESTATE AND MAKES IT ITS OWN CATEGORY. I'M THINKING THAT IF YOU HAVE PROPERTIES FOR SALE UP AN DOWN A CORRIDOR, FOR EXAMPLE, AND YOU COULD HAVE LIKE THESE GIANT SIGNS ONE FACE, 18 FEET BY 1 FOOT. BUT IF THERE'S -- LIKE, CAN WE PUT THAT IN THEIR OWN CATEGORY AND THEN SAY, LIKE, HAVE THE SIDE THING BE JUST FOR THESE TYPES OF SIGNS?
01:54:03.587: >> Planning Manager:  IT'S GETTING -- IT'S A GOOD QUESTION. TO ARE SALE AND FOR LEASE IS DEFINITELY A UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCE. THAT IS WHAT THE ORIGINAL DRAFT REFLECTED. WE HEARD A LOT OF FEEDBACK, THOUGH, THAT IT'S ALSO PRETTY FLEXIBILITY. SO I THINK THIS WAS A FEAR THAT EVERY BUSINESS OWNER NOW IS GOING TO MAINTAIN AN ADDITIONAL SIGN INDEFINITELY BECAUSE THEY ARE ALWAYS GOING TO HAVE SOME SPACE FOR SALE AND IF THEY DON'T, WHAT IS LIKELY THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO SORT OF ULTIMATELY DETERMINE THAT? YOU KNOW, WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DESIGN WHEN THEY ARE ADVERTISING FOR NEXT YEAR, VERSUS NEXT MONTH, ET CETERA. SO I THINK THIS WAS SOME CONCERN THAT THIS IS JUST A WAY TO PROVIDE -- IT'S A LOOPHOLE TO PROVIDE MORE COMMERCIAL SIGNAGE LONG TERM. SO WE HEARD THAT FEEDBACK, I THINK SOME OF THAT CONVERSATION HAPPENED AT THIS TABLE, AS WELL.
01:54:55.839: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: WHAT IF IT'S JUST FOR SALE AND NOT FOR LEASE.
01:54:58.909: >> Planning Manager: DEFINITELY NOT. AND SO I THINK IT'S INCLUSION AT THE OUTSET WAS PROBABLY ALREADY TESTING THAT BOUNDARY A LITTLE BIT, BECAUSE THAT IS RELYING ON THE CONTENT OF THE SIGN, BUT WE ARE ONLY MODERATING THE DURATION OF IT, AS OPPOSED TO ANY OTHER ASPECTS OF THE TEMPORARY SIGNAGE ALLOWED. SO -- BUT, YES, WE CAN LOOK AT THAT. WE CAN ALSO LOOK AT IF WE COULD PULL SIZE INTO THAT, I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY MORE CHALLENGING BECAUSE THEN WE ARE STARTING TO PROVIDE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR FREE SPEECH BASED ON THE CONTENT. AND SO I GUESS I WILL LEAVE IT AT THAT.
01:55:46.056: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: IS IT CONTENT OR IS IT CIRCUMSTANCE? I MEAN, YOU ARE -- I MEAN, BECAUSE YOU ARE LIKE SELLING OR LEASING A PROPERTY. I DON'T KNOW.
01:55:54.364: >> Planning Manager:  AGAIN, IDEALLY, WE WOULD NEVER HAVE TO LOOK AT WHAT'S ON THE SIGN TO MAKE A JUDGMENT WHETHER IT'S COMPLIANT OR NOT.
01:56:06.376: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER BRIGGS? NO? ALL RIGHT. FURTHER DISCUSSION?
01:56:10.314: >> Planning Manager:  CAN I GO OVER THE THINGS THAT I FEEL LIKE WE HAVE PERHAPS RESOLVED? I'M HEARING PERHAPS RESTRUCTURE THE RESIDENTIAL TO ONE TO SIX UNITS AND THEN MORE SIGN ALLOCATION FOR SEVEN UNITS OR MORE. I THINK I'M HEARING. I THINK I AM HEARING COMFORT WITH KEEPING THE CURRENT POINT ONE FOOT CANDLES PROTECTING RESIDENTIAL ZONED PROPERTY AS THE SORT OF HIGHEST PRIORITY BUT WITH A COMMITMENT THAT AS OUTDOOR LIGHTING ORDINANCE PROGRESSES THAT WE CONSIDER MAKING SURE THAT PERHAPS THIS JUST POINTS TO THOSE STANDARDS GOING FORWARD FOR CONSISTENCY? BUT THAT IT DOESN'T HURT TO HAVE THAT PROTECTION IN NOW. I'M HEARING 30 MINUTES BEFORE AND AFTER CLOSE OF BUSINESS FOR ILLUMINATION. WE PROBABLY CARE MORE ABOUT SIGNS BEING TURNED OFF QUICKER THAN OTHER OUTDOOR LIGHTS PERHAPS. I'M HEARING COMFORT WITH THE PUD APPROACH. I'M HEARING GENERAL COMFORT WITH THE BREAKDOWN OF WINDOW SIGNAGE, BOTH INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR. AND I'M HEARING ACCEPTANCE OF NOT ONLY THE STRUCTURE OF DWELLING UNITS BUT INCLUDING ONE AND TWO DWELLING UNITS WITHIN THAT CATEGORY, WHEREAS BEFORE WE PROVIDED NO SIGNAGE. I'M HEARING ABSOLUTELY LITTLE CLARITY ON TEMPORARY SEENAGE AND I KNOW THAT'S WHERE WE -- SIGNAGE AND I KNOW THAT'S WHERE WE HAVE TO WORK. BUT BESIDES THAT, EVERYTHING ELSE IS COMFORTABLE AND WE ARE NARROWLY FOCUSED ON TEMPORARY SIGNAGE? OKAY. AND GENERALLY, WHAT I'M HEARING IS WE WOULD PREFER TO ALLOW MORE TEMPORARY SIGNAGE TO REFLECT WHAT IS CURRENTLY HAPPENING IN THE WORLD? SORT OF? TWO THUMBS UP.
01:58:23.480: >> WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY WHAT IS CANCURRENTLY HAPPENING IN THE WORLD.
01:58:28.552: >> Planning Manager:  WE ARE RESPONDING TO A CONVENTION RIGHT NOW. AND SO HOWEVER THIS MANIFESTS, I ANTICIPATE TO BE CONSISTENT, IT WILL RESULT IN MORE SQUARE FOOTAGE. AND I WILL ENDEAVOR TO FIND THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT WITH WHAT I HOPE MEETS THE INTENT OF THIS DISTRICT OF CHARACTER AND QUALITY OF LIFE AND SAFETY, AND AESTHETICS, BUT AT ITS CORE HERE, WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT, 12 SQUARE FEET IS NOT ENOUGH. I JUST WANT TO SET THE STAGE THAT THESE SOLUTIONS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO PROVIDE FOR MORE THAN 12 SQUARE FEET, IF WE WANT TO ALLOW AN 18 SQUARE FOOT SIGN. THAT'S IT. AND SO --
01:59:14.631: >> Chair Milshteyn: AND THEN ONE OTHER THING IS THE 65 DAYS INCREASING THAT NUMBER FOR FOR SALE SIGNS.
01:59:25.075: >> Planning Manager:  I WILL LOOK AT THAT.
01:59:29.279: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER ABRONS AND COMMISSIONER BRIGGS.
01:59:32.015: >> Commissioner Abrons:  THE CURRENT SIZE ORDINANCE RESTRICTS SIGNS TO YOU SAID 48 INCHES BY 36 INCHES.
01:59:41.792: >> Planning Manager:  IT CAN'T BE TALLER THAN 4 FEET AND NOT WIDER THAN 3 FEET.
01:59:46.063: >> Commissioner Abrons:  AND IF WE INCREASE TO 18 SQUARE FEET, THEN WE ARE POTENTIALLY OPENING OURSELVES UP TO SIGNS WHICH ARE BIGGER, 6 FEET BY 3 FEET OR 9 BY --
01:59:56.907: >> Planning Manager:  BUT AS WE ARE DISCUSSING, I SUSPECT AS A COMMUNITY WE ARE ALREADY EXPERIENCING LARGER SIGNAGE.
02:00:06.316: >> Commissioner Abrons:  WELL, YEAH. I GUESS WHAT I'M REMEMBERING FROM THE LAST MEETING IS THAT THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO CAME TO SPEAK TO US WERE PEOPLE WHO WERE UNHAPPY WITH PROPERTY MANAGERS AND STUDENT RENTALS WITH CONSTANT RENTAL ADVERTISEMENTS FOR THOSE PROPERTIES. AND I THINK IF WE AMEND THE ORDINANCE, AS WE'RE DISCUSSING RIGHT NOW, THAT PROPER ACTUALLY WILL BE -- THIS WON'T ADDRESS THAT ISSUE. IT MIGHT MAKE IT WORSE, RIGHT? IS THAT -- I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND THAT.
02:00:41.618: >> Councilmember Bannister: Y>> Planning Manager:  YEAH, IT WOULD -- LIKE YOU SELLING YOUR HOUSE, THEY COULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ANY FOR LEASE OR SALE.
02:00:54.831: >> Commissioner Abrons:  BUT THE CITY DOESN'T HAVE A WAY OF KNOWING WHETHER THERE'S ACTUALLY AN EMPTY UNIT IN A BUILDING. SO ONE COULD -- IN OTHER WORDS ONE COULD IN PERPETUITY HAVE A LARGER FOR LEASE SIGN NOW IN THEIR YARD THAN THEY -- UNDER THIS NEW ORDINANCE, POSSIBLY, SOMEBODY COULD HAVE A LARGER SIGN FOR LEASE THAN THEY COULD ON THE CURRENT ORDINANCE?
02:01:19.423: >> Planning Manager:  I THINK THAT WAS ONE OF THE BASIS TO RID THAT EXCEPTION AND GO BACK TO THE MODIFICATION OF THE UNLIMITED SMALL SIGN, BUT, YES.
02:01:27.297: >> Commissioner Abrons:  YEAH. IT'S TOUGH.
02:01:33.870: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER BRIGGS?
02:01:35.372: >> Commissioner Briggs: I APPRECIATE THAT YOU REFRESHED -- THAT WE WENT BACK TO THAT CONVERSATION BECAUSE NOW IT'S ALL COMING BACK TO ME VERY SLOWLY. YES, THAT WAS AN ISSUE. THAT'S A SERIOUS ONE, THAT -- WHEN IT'S HAD -- YEAH. I NOW UNDERSTAND WHY WE WENT TO 65 DAYS, AND I DON'T -- YOU KNOW, I -- MAYBE WE NEED TO PROVIDE A LITTLE MORE CLARITY ON THIS BEFORE WE ASK MR. LENART TO GO OFF AND BRING SOMETHING ELSE BACK TO US, BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE I WANT TO MOVE TO HAVING SOMETHING IN AREAS WHERE EVERYTHING IS PERPETUALLY FOR LEASE, THAT THERE IS JUST NEVER A STANDARD OF WHEN IT CAN GO OFF. BUT WHAT I'M NOT INTERESTED IN SEEING IS -- I'M COGNIZANT THAT REAL ESTATE SIGNS ARE A CERTAIN SIZE TODAY, AND THAT THAT IS -- IT'S MAYBE APPROPRIATE TO ALLOW FOR THAT SIZE, BUT IS THERE AN OPPORTUNITY TO LIMIT THIS -- ALLOW FOR MORE SQUARE FEET BUT TO LIMIT THE SIZE OF ANY ONE SIDE OF A SIGN SO THAT IT'S NOT GREATER THAN? BECAUSE WHAT I DON'T WANT TO SEE EITHER ON RESIDENTIAL OR COMMERCIAL PROPERTY -- AND I WOULDN'T WANT TO SUPPORT AT ALL -- IS BIGGER AND MORE SIGNS ACROSS THE CITY. I'M FIND -- HONESTLY, I THINK -- I HONESTLY THINK OUR TEMPORARY SIGN RESTRICTION IS PRETTY LOW IF WE LOOK AROUND ANN ARBOR AND HOW MANY I SUPPORT THIS AND THIS. PEOPLE HAVE LIKE EIGHT SIGNS AT CERTAIN TIMES OF YEAR. I'M -- MAYBE WE GO OVERBOARD AND WE COULD LIMIT OURSELVES. I'M PERSONALLY NOT SUPPORTIVE OF SEEING THE SIZE -- THE SIZE OF THE SIGNS GROW. I GUESS I WOULD LIKE SOME FEEDBACK BEFORE I SEND YOU OFF ON THIS ISSUE. IS IT POSSIBLE TO LIMIT THE SIZE OF ANY ONE SIZE?
02:03:43.800: >> Planning Manager:  I DON'T IT'S LIMITED TO  6 SQUARE FEET PER SIDE, AND DO YOU WANT TO LIMIT IT TO 9 SQUARE FEET PER SIDE. AND IF THAT'S THE GOAL, THEN WE NEED TO INCREASE TOTAL AMOUNT. THAT THE SIMPLEST IS TO FRANKLY SET FREE STANDING SIGNS AT A MAXIMUM OF 18 SQUARE FEET AND THAT WOULD PROVIDE UP TO A MAXIMUM OF 9 SQUARE FEET. AND THE TOTAL MAXIMUM SQUARE FOOTAGE FOR SMALL LOTS BE 18 SQUARE FEET. THEN IF YOU CHOOSE TO DO THAT, TWO-SIDED REAL ESTATE SIGN, YOU WOULD BE USING ALL OF YOUR POTENTIAL SQUARE FOOTAGE AND MAXING OUT THE FREE STANDING SIGN AND LIMB YOU LIMIT YOUR ABO PUT ANY OTHER SIGNAGE UP, BUT IT WOULD BE COMPLIANT.
02:04:30.113: >> Chair Milshteyn: SO I'M NOT IN FAVOR OF HAVING AN 18 SQUARE FOOT ONE-SIDED SIGN IN FRONT OF A PROPERTY. I'M COMPLETELY NOT IN FAVOR OF THAT. YOU KNOW, ALTHOUGH SEEING MY NAME IN 18 SQUARE FEET -- YEAH, NO. I THINK FOR SALE SIGNS, MY APPROACH WOULD BE A -- SO MANY SQUARE FEET PER SIDE. THE ONE THING THAT I AM CONCERNED ABOUT IS, YOU KNOW, PER SIDE, AND I GUESS I WOULD -- SO I WOULDN'T WANT TO JUST LEAVE IT AT, FOR EXAMPLE, 9 SQUARE FEET PER SIDE. I WOULD WANT TO HAVE UP TO 9 SQUARE FEET PER SIDE WITH A TOTAL OF X NUMBER OF SQUARE FEET SO 18 SQUARE FEET. WE ARE STARTING TO SEE THREE-SIDED AND FOUR-SIDED SIGNS COME OUT. SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN ALLOWING FOR 9 SQUARE FEET ON A -- ON FOUR DIFFERENT SIDES AND ALL OF A SUDDEN IT BECOMES A HUGE, HUGE, YOU KNOW, THING. SO I WOULD WANT TO SOMEHOW SAY 9 SQUARE FEET PER SIDE UP TO TWO SIDES OR 9 SQUARE FEET PER SIDE UP TO 18 SQUARE FEET TOTAL. SO THAT WE ARE NOT SEEING HUMIDITY, GIGANTIC FOUR-SIDED SIGNS OR THREE-SIDED SIGNS. COMMISSIONER MILLS?
02:05:49.125: >> Vice Chair Mills: THAT'S GREAT! AND MY SUGGESTION ON AMENDING THAT TABLE IS TO KEEP THE SAME STRUCTURE THAT YOU HAVE RIGHT NOW, MR. LENART. CLEARLY WHAT WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT, INCREASING THE MAX THAT'S ALLOWED PER LOT, TO 18 SQUARE FEET, ON THE SMALLEST LOTS AND THEN SCALING APPROPRIATE LeAS LY AS YOU GO U. THE MAX PER SIGN SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO ABOUT CHANGING YOUR DEFINITION OF WHAT IS A SIGN AND MAKING THAT 18 SQUARE FEET BUT IN THAT -- IN THAT LITTLE THING, MAKING AN ADDITIONAL, LIKE COMMA, EACH SIDE NOT TO EXSOEXCEEDNINE SQUARE FEET. SO IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A THREE-SIDED SIGN, YOU CAN HAVE IT SIX FEET -- SIX SQUARE FEET ON EACH SIDE BUT ANY ONE OF THOSE FACES OF THAT SIGN, YOU COULDN'T HAVE -- AND NOT MORE THAN 9 SQUARE FEET AND THEN IF YOU HAVE A SINGLE SIDED SIGN, YOU GOT NINE BUT YOU CAN HAVE UP TO FOUR SIGNS STILL ON THAT PIECE OF PROPERTY. UP TO HOW MANY EVER IT NEEDS TO GET TO THE 18 SQUARE FEET MAXIMUM PER LOT. DOES THAT MAKE SENSE? IS THAT DOABLE?
02:07:05.235: >> Planning Manager:  I THINK THAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT THE OR NANCE DOES NOW. IT MEASURES THREE-SIDED OR TWO-SIDED AS TOTAL SQUARE FOOTAGE. SO I DON'T THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE HERE. I HAVE THINK THE -- WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND RIGHT OFF THE BAT IS WHY IT'S OKAY THAT YOU CAN MANIFEST IN THREE PANELS OR FOUR PANELS OR TWO PANELS AND WIREDRAWING THE LINE AT ONE PANEL? -- WE ARE DRAWING THE LINE AT ONE PANEL. THAT'S MY HANG-UP. I -- I THINK WHAT I'M HEARING IS YES, PROVIDE MORE TEMPORARY SQUARE FOOTAGE. UP TO 18. DON'T MESS WITH THE MAXIMUM NUMBER. AND FIND A WAY IDEALLY THAT WE ARE KEEPING THE SCALE OF THE SIGNS ESSENTIALLY NO GREATER THAN HALF THE MAX. SO -- AND I THINK THAT'S THE INTENT. I DON'T KNOW THAT I WOULD DUPLICATE THE HOW WE MEASURE HERE, AND BE IT TWO SIDES OR THREE SIDES, I THINK I WOULD TRY TO EXPLORE WAYS THAT WE COULD -- WE WOULD BASICALLY BE SAYING YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE A ONE-SIDED FREE STANDING SIDE. THAT'S THE THING THAT I WOULD WANT TO FIGURE OUT THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT.
02:08:35.425: >> Commissioner Abrons:  ARE YOU CALLING ON ME? I'M WONDERING BECAUSE THE TIME LIMITS ON ON THE FOR SALE, VERSUS RENTAL, AND THAT SORT OF CONCERN AND THE -- THE PROS AND CONS -- LIKE, YOU KNOW WHAT THIS BUYS US BETWEEN RENTALS AND SALES AND HOW YOU CAN'T DECLINEIATE BETWEEN THE TWO-FAMILY. I THINK'S FRICTION THERE THAT WE CAN'T SOLVE IN THIS. ITS NO THE CONTENT BASTE AND WE HAVE IDEAS ABOUT WHAT RENTALS LOOK LIKE AND THE SIGNS LOOK LIKE VERSUS FOR SALE AND HOW LONG THEY STAY UP. I'M WONDERING IF YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT FOR SALE AND NEEDS TO BE LONGER THAN 65 DAYS, CAN YOU -- IS THERE A WAY TO LOOK AT THE PERMANENT SIGNAGE, SO ALEX YOU'RE NEARING 50 DAYS. WE SHOULD PULL A PERMIT AND MY COMMISSION WILL PAY FOR THE PERMIT FEE AND THE TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP WOULD REDACT THE -- THE PERMIT FOR THE -- FOR THE PERMANENT SIGN. LIKE WHAT WOULD MAKE IT NON-CONFORMING IN A CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP OR SOMETHING? LIKE AT SOME POINT, CAN YOU JUST APPLY FOR A PERMIT FOR SIGNAGE PAST 65 DAYS? RIGHT NOW FOR OVER 65 DAYS WE DON'T HAVE A PERMANENT SQUARE --
02:10:00.343: >> Planning Manager:  AND ONE SQUARE FOOT.
02:10:04.213: >> Commissioner Sauve: INSTEAD OF OPENING UP FOR 65 DAYS FOR ANYTHING, EXTENDING IT LONGER -- YOU KNOW, WE DON'T REALLY KNOW THE END DAY OF WHAT THAT KIND OF TIPPING POINT IS AND, YOU KNOW, IF REAL ESTATE SAYS YEAH, WE GOT TO INVEST AND SELL THIS THING AND THE SIGN IS GOING TO DO IT, WE WILL PAY THE PERMITTING FEE AND GO THROUGH THE LEG WORK, MAYBE THAT'S A THING TO LOOK AT TOO. BUT WOULD THAT -- WOULD THAT FOR SALE SIGN BE ABLE TO STAY UP WITH THE NEW OWNERSHIP AS A PERMANENT SIGN? LIKE, COULD YOU JUST PUT UP A FREE STANDING PERMANENT SIGN THEN AND NOT SELL YOUR HOUSE? LIKE, I COULD JUST PUT UP A SIGN IN MY FRONT YARD.
02:10:49.058: >> Planning Manager:  ALEX, DO YOU HAVE A SENSE ARE MOST SIGNS UP LONGER THAN 65 DAYS?
02:10:57.200: >> Chair Milshteyn: THEY GENERALLY ARE. IT TAKES FOR TWO WEEKS TO FOR A PROPERTY TO SALE IN THE ANN ARBOR AREA AND ANOTHER 45 DAYS TO CLOSE OR MORE.
02:11:06.075: >> Planning Manager:  YEAH, BUT LIKE -- BUT IT'S -- IT'S SOLD AFTER TWO WEEKS IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE, RIGHT?
02:11:15.985: >> Chair Milshteyn: NO, BECAUSE WHAT --
02:11:18.154: >> Commissioner Sauve: YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD LA OF THE LONGER. SORRY, ALEX, IS BUILDING CONSTRUCTION SIGNS. LIKE RESIDENTIAL REMODEL SIGNS. THOSE TAKE LONGER THAN 65 DAYS.
02:11:29.399: >> Chair Milshteyn: YEP.
02:11:29.932: >> Commissioner Sauve: AS FREE STANDING SIGN. TEMPORARY SIGN.
02:11:36.739: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER MILLS?
02:11:38.007: >> Vice Chair Mills: SO IS THAT AN OPTION THAT WE COULD ACTUALLY -- ACTUALLY IF YOU NEED TO HAVE I A TEMPORARY SIGN THAT'S LONGER FOR 65 DAYS, THIS IS WHAT YOU HAVE TO GET A PERMIT?
02:11:50.620: >> Planning Manager:  THAT'S HOW IT IS NOW.
02:11:55.825: >> Commissioner Sauve: BUT YOU CAN'T GET A PERMIT FOR A FREE STANDING SIGN IN THE RESIDENTIAL AREA WITH THIS?
02:12:03.099: >> Planning Manager:  ONLY FOR FIVE UNITS OR MORE. I PRESUME THAT WILL BE SEVEN UNITS OR MORE.
02:12:10.239: >> Vice Chair Mills: BUT THE QUESTION IS, WHERE THE PERMIT -- AND WHAT I HEARD LISA SAY IS YOU DON'T WANT THYMIER MILT TO MEAN THAT EVEN AFTER THE HOUSE IS SOLD, IT CAN TAKE THERE PERMANENTLY. I'M THINKING IS THIS SOME VERY TEMPORARY WHERE YOU CAN BE 65 DAYS WITH NOTHING -- LIKE WITH NO EXTENSION? AND THEN PERMANENT FOR AN EXTENSION.
02:12:41.270: >> Planning Manager:  IF THAT'S THE CASE, WE ARE NOT REQUIRING PERMITS FOR TEMPORARY SIGNS WE WOULD ONLY JUST EXTEND THE TIME FRAME. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE MECHANISM WOULD BE THAT -- YOU DON'T NEED TO GET A PERMIT TO PUT UP A TEMPORARY SIGN AND THEN AFTER 65 DAYS YOU GIVE YOURSELF A 65-DAY EXTENSION. I MEAN IF THAT WAS THE CASE, JUST MAKE IT 130 DAYS OR WHATEVER.
02:13:04.794: >> Vice Chair Mills: I FEEL LIKE IT'S MORE LIKE YOU COME IN. IF YOU NEED MORE THAN THE 65 DAYS. JUST LIKE WE HAVE -- I'M THINKING IN MY MIND FOR EVENTS. YOU ARE ALLOWED TO HAVE AN EVENT IN YOUR PARKING LOT, IF IT'S THIS LONG. IF YOU WANT IT LONGER, YOU HAVE TO COME IN AND GET A PERMIT, EVEN A TEMPORARY ENTER THAT'S AN OUTDOOR EVENT THAT'S LONGER THAN THAT. I DON'T KNOW.
02:13:26.282: >> Planning Manager:  IT WOULDN'T BE THAT -- IF I'M UNDERSTANDING, YOU WOULDN'T NEED A SIGN PERMIT FOR 65 DAYS BUT YOU WOULD NEED A SIGN PERMIT FOR 66 DAYS.
02:13:37.627: >> Vice Chair Mills: AND IMPORTANTLY, THAT PERMIT DOES NOT MEAN IT CAN STAY UP FOREVER. IT'S NOT LIKE YOU CAN NOW HAVE THAT SIGN THERE IN PERPETUITY. IT WOULD BE SOME KIND OF FIXED, YOU KNOW, AND I'M -- REALTORS CAN GIVE THEMSELVES A BREAK. I THINK YOU ARE TOTALLY RIGHT, THIS IDEA OF LIKE THIS TENSION BETWEEN, YOU KNOW, WHAT THE DIFFERENT SIGNS ARE FOR DIFFERENT PURPOSES, EVEN JUST WITHIN THE REAL ESTATE, LIKE THIS IS AN ONGOING THING, AND -- LIKE, I DON'T -- IT'S BEEN SO LONG THAT WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THAT I CAN'T EXACTLY REMEMBER THE IDEA WHY WE HAVE TO HAVE THIS UNLIMITED TEMPORARY SIGN, BUT THAT IS JUST BALONEY. LIKE -- IT JUST SEEMS CRAZY TO ME!
02:14:23.372: >> Planning Manager:  IT'S A FREE SPEECH PROVISION. YOU ARE PLANNING FOR SOME OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU TO EXPRESS YOURSELF. THE NONCOMMERCIAL WAY. SAVE THE WHALES, SIGN ORDINANCES ARE HARD, WHATEVER IT IS. WE ARE GIVING YOU AN OPPORTUNITY -- WE'RE NOT TAKING AWAY YOUR ABILITY TO SHARE A THOUGHT.
02:14:47.463: >> Chair Milshteyn: WELL, THE OTHER OPTION IS TO INCREASE IT FROM 65 DAYS TO 180 DAYS WHICH I KNOW IS A LONG PERIOD OF TIME, BUT IT -- THEN IT TAKES AWAY FROM A SIGN BEING UP ALL YEAR ROUND, AND I THINK IT COVERS MOST CYCLES FOR REAL ESTATE AND FOR RENTAL. SO IF WE REALLY WANTED TO GIVE IT A TIME FRAME, I THINK THAT 180 DAYS WOULD BE APPROPRIATE. MY CONCERN WITH, YOU KNOW, TEMPORARY SIGN, CONVERTING IT TO A PERMANENT SIGN, GETTING THAT PERMIT, ARE WE GOING TO BE REQUIRED TO GO THROUGH A PERMIT INSPECTION? WHAT EXACTLY IS THAT GOING TO TAKE? I JUST DON'T THINK THAT'S REASONABLE. SO I THINK WE JUST -- I KNOW WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO SOLVE. SO GIVING LOCKER TIME FRAME, BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THOSE SIGNS ON THE FOR RENTAL PROPERTIES, ESPECIALLY AROUND THE CAMPUS AREA ARE UP 365 DAYS A YEAR. THEY NEVER GO DOWN UNLESS THE STUDENTS TAKE THEM DOWN. OR THEY LITERALLY FADE AWAY. SO I THINK GIVING IT SOME TIME FRAME, BUT DOING A PRETTY -- YOU KNOW, 180 DAYS OR SOME LARGE NUMBER WOULD BE APPROPRIATE. COMMISSIONER BRIGGS?
02:16:22.358: >> Commissioner Briggs: I'M NOT GOOD WITH OPERATING WITH TWO SCREENS. MY MOUSE GETS COMPLETELY LOST AND I DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET BACK. I DON'T KNOW. SORRY. TO COMMISSIONER MILLS' POINT, I AGREE THIS UNLIMITED SIGN THING IS -- IT'S BEEN BUGGING ME FOREVER AND I -- LIKE, I GET -- LIKE -- YOU COULD STILL TAKE DOWN THE TEMPORARY SIGN AND PUT ANOTHER TEMPORARY SIGN UP A COUPLE OF DAYS LATER AND WE STILL HAVE THAT -- BUT I DON'T -- I DON'T GET THIS UNLIMITED SIGN THING. I WOULD PERSONALLY REALLY SUPPORT GETTING RID OF THAT. TO ME, 180 DAYS SEEMS LIKE REALLY LONG. BUT I COULD IMAGINE IT LONGER THAN 65 DAYS TOO. I WILL TRY TO KEEP MY THING ON THIS SCREEN.
02:17:11.307: >> Chair Milshteyn: HOW ABOUT 175 DAYS, I'M KIDDING. COMMISSIONER SAUVE.
02:17:15.077: >> Commissioner Sauve: I THINK THROUGH ALL OF THIS CONVERSATION, I -- I WOULD SUPPORT EXTENDING IT. I REALLY WANT TO KIND OF MOVE AWAY WHEN WE START TALKING ABOUT DWELLINGS AND TYPES AND SIGNAGE, THOUGH, DIFFERENTIATING BETWEEN RENTALS AND OWNERSHIP. I THINK THAT'S MY BIGGEST CONCERN WITH HOW WE'RE WEIGHING THE PROS AND CONS OF SIGNAGE. WE HAVE REALLY SPLIT IT BINARY AND THAT'S CONCERNING TO ME. SO HOWEVER WE DO THIS, WE NEED TO DO IT IN A FAIR AND EQUAL WAY, THAT WHATEVER TYPE OF RESIDENCE YOU TAKE UP, ISN'T A FACTOR IN IT.
02:18:00.156: >> Chair Milshteyn: ALL RIGHT, MR. LEN LENART, I KNOW WE HAVENT GIVEN YOU MUCH DIRECTION ON THIS AND I APOLOGIZE.
02:18:07.997: >> Planning Manager:  ALL RIGHT, I WILL DO MY BEST.
02:18:10.599: >> Chair Milshteyn: ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU.
02:18:11.500: >> Planning Manager:  IT SOUNDS TO ME, THOUGH, THAT I FEEL LIKE WE ARE DOWN TO TEMPORARY SIGNS, BUT NOW PERHAPS, IT'S NO LONGER JUST THE SIZE OF FREE STANDING SIGNS BUT IT'S ALSO WHETHER OR NOT TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE ANY SORT OF UNLIMITED OPPORTUNITY. OKAY.
02:18:40.029: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL.
02:18:42.064: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: DO YOU KNOW HOW OTHER COMMUNITIES HANDLE THE REAL ESTATE THING? I MEAN, BECAUSE 160 DAYS SEEMS TOO LONG TO ME TOO. AND SO -- BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE COMPLETELY UNREASONABLE AND SHORT CIRCUIT IT, LIKE BEYOND WHAT IS JUST TYPICAL EVEN. SO --
02:19:03.519: >> Planning Manager:  THIS IS BASED OPEN ORDINANCES FROM OTHER COMMUNITIES. I CAN TRY TO PROVIDE A LITTLE BUILT MORE DETAILED RESEARCH.
02:19:12.495: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: YOU DON'T HAVE TO PROVIDE IT. GIVE US A SENSE OF HOW MANY PEOPLE FUNCTION OTHER PLACES. WHAT DO THEY DO?
02:19:19.368: >> Planning Manager:  A LOT OF COMMUNICATES ARE STRUGGLING WITH IT THE WAY WE ARE, IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS COURT CASE. THESE ARE THE EXACT KIND OF ISSUES BECAUSE A LOT OF COMMUNITIES ARE COMING OUT EVER AROUND WHERE WE BUILT OUR ORDINANCES IN RESPONSE TO THINGS AND OFTEN THOSE THINGS WERE VERY SPECIFIC. AND WE CULTURALLY HAVE COME TO HAVE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF ACCEPTANCE OF THOSE AS COMMISSIONER SAUVE WAS JUST DESCRIBING. WE ARE NOT AFFORDED THAT OPPORTUNITY ANYMORE UNDER OUR CASE LAW AND CONSTITUTION. SO -- BUT, YEAH, WE COULD -- BUT IN SHORT, SOME OTHER COMMUNITIES ARE RESTRICTED IT IN A SIMILAR WAY. BROADLY PUTTING TIME LIMITS IN PLACE SO THAT YOU DON'T HAVE THE PERPETUAL TEMPORARY SIGNAGE. THAT'S THE INTENTION. I CAN TRY TO BRING SOME MORE SPECIFIC EXAMPLES OF ALTERNATIVE WAYS THAT MAYBE PEOPLE ARE RECENTLY ADOPTED ORDINANCES AS WELL.
02:20:18.460: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: CAN THEY RENEW? HOW WOULD THAT ACTUALLY WORK? YOU KNOW, I MEAN THAT ALSO SEEMS LIKE ANOTHER POSSIBILITY IS THAT, YOU KNOW, GOT TO TRY TO SELL IT AND IF IT DOESN'T HAPPEN, THEN YOU HAVE TO DO SOME EXTRA LEG WORK IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. BUT I DON'T WANT IT TO BE AN UNREASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME TO BE ABLE TO SELL A HOUSE. I DON'T WANT IT TO BE LIKE AT THE SHORT END OF WHATEVER THAT -- YOU KNOW, I WANT IT TO BE A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME. I MEAN IS IT -- LIKE, DO -- DO YOU HAVE TO KEEP IT UP THE WHOLE TIME THROUGH CLOSING?
02:20:59.768: >> Chair Milshteyn: YOU DON'T HAVE TO, BUT IMAGINE THAT YOU ARE THE HOME SELLER, AND YOU ARE IN THE MIDST OF A REAL ESTATE TRANSACTION THAT HASN'T CLOSED YET, EVEN THOUGH YOU HAVE A BENPENDING DEAL, ANYTHING COULD FALL THROUGH AT ANY POINT.
02:21:15.651: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: COULDN'T YOU PUT IT BACK UP AGAIN, THOUGH?
02:21:19.388: >> Chair Milshteyn: BUT KEEP IN MIND, YOU ARE THE HOME SELLER, DON'T YOU WANT TO KEEP MARKETING YOUR HOME SO YOU HAVE A PLAN B?
02:21:32.468: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: SO IT'S BASICALLY BALANCING THE NEEDS OF THE NEIGHBORS VERSUS THE NEEDS OF THE SELLERS?
02:21:39.408: >> Chair Milshteyn: MM-HMM.
02:21:40.009: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: IN SOME WAYS, YEAH.
02:21:43.779: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER BRIGGS?
02:21:45.247: >> Planning Manager: GOVERNANCE.
02:21:47.516: >> Commissioner Briggs: JUST ONE FINAL THING. JUST ONE FINAL COMMENT ON THE DISCUSSION WE ARE ON RENTAL VERSUS FOR SALE. I THINK IN THIS DISCUSSION, JUST TO -- I THINK IT'S -- WHAT WE'RE ULTIMATELY TRYING TO DO BECAUSE WE HAVE A LARGE RENTAL COMMUNITY IN ANN ARBOR, IS TO ACTUALLY PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF THE FOLKS IN THOSE COMMUNITIES, NOT TO HAVE TO LIVE AMONGST BLIGHT. SO THAT THE GOAL OF THIS, I THINK ISN'T TO HOW -- I THINK THE -- WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO ACHIEVE IS ACTUALLY -- IS SOMETHING GOOD FOR OR COMMUNITY. SO I'M GLAD WE ARE TRYING TO WORK THROUGH IT.
02:22:30.826: >> Chair Milshteyn: CAN I GET A COMMISSION TO POSTPONE AFTER COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT.
02:22:37.733: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: TWO SUPER QUICK THINGS. I KNOW YOU SEED FOR THE LEASE AND FOR SALE SIGNS IT'S RESTRICTED HEIGHT AND WIDTH. I MEAN CAN WE DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO AVOID THESE 18-FOOT LONG SIDES AND YOU HAVE 18 FEET TOTAL IN AREA, BUT YOU HAVE TO BE, YOU KNOW -- YOU DIDN'T -- YOUR HEIGHT IS LIMITED TO, LIKE, 3 FEET AND YOUR WIDTH IS LIMITED TO 3 FEET OR WHATEVER THE REAL ESTATE SIGN TYPICALLY LOOKS LIKE. I DON'T KNOW IF ANYTHING LIKE THAT WOULD BE POSSIBLE.
02:23:06.895: >> Planning Manager:  WE DO CURRENTLY PROPOSE TO RESTRICT HEIGHT. SO THAT WOULD BE NO DIFFERENT. AGAINSAGAIN JUST TRYING TO -- IT SO INTERESTED IN REDEFINING DISTINCT CATEGORY OF HOW WE MEASURE SIGNAGE AND FACES AND HEIGHT. I WOULD RATHER FIND A WAY WAY TO ARTICULATE THE SIGNAGE RESTRICTIONS THAT WE DON'T WANT. ANY FREE STANDING SIGN HAS TO BE -- CAN'T EXCEED 18 SQUARE FEET AND IT CAN'T BE WIDER THAN SOMETHING ELSE.
02:23:45.501: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: BUT YOU HAVE TO UP TO HOW MANY SPACES WITHIN THAT. AND THEN I GUESS THE  THE LAST G ON THE TEMPORARY YARD -- LEEK THE SIGNS THAT -- I MEAN, THEY ARE ALL OVER MY NEIGHBORHOOD. LIKE THANK YOU HEALTHCARE WORKERS. WE ARE ULTIMATELY SAYING YOU CAN'T HAVE THAT. RIGHT?
02:24:07.289: >> Planning Manager:  YOU ARE SAYING YOU CAN KEEP THEM UP TO FOR 65 DAYS AND REMOVE THEM FOR 30. YOU CAN'T HAVE SO MANY NOW THAT YOU EXCEED 12 SQUARE FEET.
02:24:17.499: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: SO IT'S THE UNLIMITED. DOCTOR.
02:24:21.336: >> Planning Manager:  IF YOU HAD ONE THAT WAS 3 SQUARE FEET AND A NONCOMMERCIAL MESSAGE YOU CAN DECLARE THAT TO BE YOUR UNLIMITED SIGN AND KEEP IT UP INDEFINITELY.
02:24:32.314: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: ALL RIGHT. MY HEAD IS SPINNING NOW. I WILL GO AHEAD AND MOVE TO POSTPONE.
02:24:37.286: >> Chair Milshteyn: DO I HAVE A SECOND? SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER MILLS. ANY DISCUSSION ABOUT POSTPONEMENT? SEEING NONE, ALL OF THOSE IN FAVOR OF THE POSTPONEMENT, SAY AYE. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? ALL RIGHT, POSTPONEMENT IS APPROVED. IT'S 9:26, I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A FIVE-MINUTE -- WE WILL DO A FIVE-MINUTE BREAK TO 9:32 BECAUSE IT'S NOW 9:27. SO 9:32, I WILL SEE YOU IN A COUPLE OF MINUTES. [ BREAK ]
02:31:12.313: >> Chair Milshteyn: SO WE ARE ON TO REGULAR BUSINESS AND NEXT ITEM ON OUR AGENDA IS 2800 JACKSON ROAD O HOTELS AND SITE PLAN FOR CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL. WE'LL BEGIN THE -- WE'LL BEGIN THIS ITEM WITH THE PETITIONER PRESENTATION AND THEN WE'LL MOVE ON TO A STAFF REPORT PUBLIC, PUC COMMENT AND THEN DISCUSSION.
02:31:51.253: >> Planning Manager: PETITIONERS YOU SHOULD BE PROMOTED TO PANELISTS WHERE YOU CAN TURN ON YOUR VIDEO AND SOUND.
02:32:06.868: >> OOPS. HOLD ON. OKAY. CAN YOU SEE US? ARE WE GOOD? OKAY. I'M SUSAN BAUERS WITH BA BOWER D ASSOCIATES. TO PRESENT 2800 JACKSON ROAD HOTEL DEVELOPMENT. WE ARE PROPOSING TO PUT TWO HOTELS ON THERE. THERE WAS A HOTEL ON THERE IN 2009 IT WAS DEMOLISHED, I THINK. THE HOTEL A IS APPROXIMATELY 69,000 SQUARE FEET, AND 128 ROOMS. HOTEL B IS APPROXIMATELY 63,000 SQUARE FEET AND BOTH FOUR STORIES. LANDSCAPE PLAN MEETING THE ORDINANCE. NEXT. HOTEL IS A NEW CONCEPT, STANDARD HOTEL, STANDARD STAY. IN. NEXT, PLEASE. UPPER FLOORS OF HOTEL A. IT'S EXTENDED STAY WITH PROVISIONS FOR KITCHENETTES. NEXT. EXTERIOR ELEVATION FOR HOTEL A IS FOUR STORIES, POP ELEMENT ON THE HOTEL IS 55 FEET, IT'S MASONRY AND METAL PANELS THE BUILDING. NEXT. A COURT SHARE ENTRY. THIS IS H HOTEL B. HOTEL B IS FOUR STORIES AS WELL. THE TOP ELEMENT IS JUST UNDER 5. IT HAS A MIXED MATERIAL OF MASONRY AND STONE VENEER WITH A SMALL PORT SHARED AREA IN THE FRONT. THIS FRONTS JACKSON AVENUE. WE HAVE WORKED TO ENHANCE THIS SOUTH ELEVATION TO ADDRESS MORE OF A FACADE AND THE ROAD ON JACKSON AVENUE. NEXT. THIS IS THE MATE MATERIALS PALAR HOTEL A. THOSE DARKER AREAS GO UNDER THE PORT CASHIRE. AND THIS IS BRICK, CAST STONE AND AN ACCENT COLOR AT THE ENTRY ELEMENT WHICH IS THEIR SIGNATURE PIECE FROM THE BRAND. NEXT. RENDERINGS OF HOTEL A. NEXT. RENDERINGS OF HOTEL B. YOU CAN SEE THE AREA. THE BACK IS THE I-94. WE ARE TAKING UP THE MAJORITY OF THAT SITE. NEXT. AND THIS IS THE -- ANOTHER AERIAL VIEW, JACKSON ROAD IS ON THE RIGHT. THE ON RAMP TO I-94 IS ON THE LEFT THERE. AND I-94 IS BEHIND YOU. NEXT. THIS IS THE SERVICE DRIVE IS ON THE RIGHT-HAND SIDE, AND I-94 IS ON THE SMALL PIECE ON THE LEFT. NEXT. AND THIS IS FROM I-94 AND YOU SEE A LITTLE BIT OF JACKSON ROAD IN THE BACK. NEXT? I THINK THAT'S IT. OOPS. OKAY. THAT'S ALL I HAVE.
02:37:23.084: >> Chair Milshteyn: OKAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE WILL NOW HEAD TO MR. KOWALSKI FOR A STAFF REPORT. WELCOME.
02:37:31.426: >> THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE. OKAY. I WILL JUST TOUCH ON A COUPLE OF THE HIGHLIGHTS THE PETITIONER HAS ALREADY COVERED THE MAJOR ITEMS OF IT, THE TWO MAIN HOTELS, OBVIOUSLY, AS WELL AS A REZONING PETITION THAT GOES ALONG WITH THIS. THE SITE IS CURRENTLY ZONED R5, WHICH IS SOLELY A HOTEL ONLY. IT ALLOWS HOTELS AND SOME SIMILAR RELATED USES, NURSING HOMES, BUT NO RESTAURANTS OR ANYTHING ELSE SIMILAR TO THAT. SO THE REQUESTED ZONING WOULD BE C3 WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE SURROUNDING ZONES. PARCELS ON BOTH SIDES ARE C3. THE MASTER PLAN DOES SAY COMMERCIAL FOR THE SITE. A COUPLE OF -- I DID WANT TO POINT OUT SOME -- THE PETITIONER DID HIGHLIGHT ON THE ELEVATIONS. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE WORKED WITH STAFF TO BRING IT UP TO THE POINT THAT YOU SEE TODAY. RELATED TO THAT AS WELL, BUILDING LOCATIONS AT FIRST SUBMITTAL, THE BUILDING LOCATIONS ARE BOTH KIND OF PUSHED BACK TOWARDS I-94, AND CONSISTENT WITH SOME OF OUR PLANNING GUIDELINES WITHIN THE MASTER PLANS AND THINGS, WE DID ENCOURAGE THEM TO BRING IT UP CLOSER AS YOU WILL SEE HERE. ON THE IMAGE NOW, OBVIOUSLY WITHIN THE -- THE MINIMUM/MAXIMUM SETBACK OF JACKSON AVENUE THERE. SO THAT WAS A CHANGE. PREVIOUSLY, AS I SAID, H HOTEL A WAS IN THE SAME POSITION AND HOTEL B WAS PUSHED BACK IN THE CORNER. IN ADDITION, THEY DID ONE THING THAT IS IMPORTANT TO TOUCH ON HERE, THIS IS NO SIDEWALK. THAT'S CURRENTLY AT THAT LOCATION. IT ENDS IMMEDIATELY TO THE EAST, IN FRONT OF SOME STRIP MALL DEVELOPMENT TYPE RIGHT THERE. THAT SIDEWALK DOES END AT THEIR PROPERTY LINE. THE PETITIONER IS REQUIRED TO EXTEND THE SIDEWALK ACROSS THE FRONTAGE OF THEIR PROPERTY, HOWEVER, IT'S MENTIONED IN THE TV REPORT AS WELL, THAT THE PETITIONER HAS AGREED LATER DEVELOPMENT AFTER THE PROJECT WAS SUBMITTED, ACTUALLY QUITE A BIT AFTER, OUR TRAFFIC ENGINEER WAS NOTIFIED BY M DOT, THEY WILL DO IMPROVEMENTS TO THAT ON RAMP THAT'S IMMEDIATELY  ADJACENT FOR EASTBOUND 94 AND AS PART OF THAT, THEY WILL BE DOING INTERSECTION EVALUATION AND IMPROVEMENTS ACROSS THAT. SO THEY HAVE ASKED THAT THE CITY COULD EXTEND THE SIDEWALK ACROSS THE NEIGHBORING PARCEL WHICH IS KIND OF ON A WHITE -- IT'S RIGHT AT THE CORNER OF 94 -- RIGHT, WHERE YOU SEE THE LITTLE HAND GOING THIS. SO THE PETITIONER HAS AGREED TO FUND THAT IMPROVEMENT ACROSS THE ADJACENT PROPERTY, AS FAR AS CONTINUING THAT SIDEWALK. SO BETWEEN THIS SITE AND -- BETWEEN THE SUBJECT SITE AND ADJACENT ONE, THAT'S A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT SIDEWALK LINKAGE AND THEN ACROSS THE I-94 ENTRANCE RAMP, YOU, OF COURSE, HAVE THE OTHER HOTELS THAT ALSO HAVE SIDEWALKS IN FRONT OF THEIRS. THAT REALLY COVERS SOME OF THE HIGHLIGHTS. THEY DID HAVE SOME EASY CHARGING STATIONS AT, I BELIEVE THERE'S TWO FOR EACH HOTEL. THEY ARE LOCATED ADJACENT TO THE BUILDINGS, AND THAT CONCLUDES THE STAFF REPORT, AND WE ARE RECOMMENDING APPROVAL. C3 ZONING, AND THE PLAN. THANK YOU.
02:41:03.037: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU. A THIS TIME, I WOULD LIKE TO OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING. IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO SPEAK THREE THREE MINUTES ABOUT THE REZONING AND SITE PLAN FOR 2800 JACKSON ROAD, YOU CAN CALL 877-853-5247, AND ENDING MEETING ID 975-0054-2638. CITY STAFF WILL SELECT CALLERS THAT HAVE RAISED THEIR HAND ONE BY ONE, USING THE LAST THREE DIGITS OF YOUR PHONE NUMBER. IN ORDER TO ELECTRONICALLY RAISE YOUR HAND, AFTER DIALING INTO THE MEETING, PLEASE PRESS STAR NINE ON YOUR PHONE. YOU WILL HEAR AN AUTOMATED ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE HOST IS ALLOWING YOU TO SPEAK, WHEN SPEAKING PLEASE MOVE TO A QUIET AREA AND MUTE ANY TELEVISION OR BACKGROUND SOUNDS SO WE MAY HEAR YOU CLEARLY. PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS AT THE BEGINNING OF YOUR COMMENTS.
02:42:12.340: >> Planning Manager:  ONE MOMENT. NO SPEAKERS FOR THIS PUBLIC HEARING.
02:42:17.278: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU. I WILL GO AHEAD AND READ THE MOTION FOR US FOR THIS EVENING. THE MOTION IS AS FOLLOWS AND WE HAVE TWO MOTIONS. THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION HEREBY RECOMMENDS THAT THE MAYOR AND THE CITY COUNCIL APPROVE THE 2800 JACKSON AVENUE HOTELS DEVELOPMENT REZONING FROM R5 TO C3 FRINGE COMMERCIAL, AND MOTION NUMBER TWO, THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION HEREBY PRE RECOMMENDS THAT THE MAYOR AND THE CITY COUNCIL APPROVE 2800 JACKSON ROAD HOTELS SITE PLAN AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT. PRIOR TO GETTING THIS MOVES DO ANY COMMISSIONERS OBJECT TO TAKING THESE TOGETHER? SEEING NO ONE, MOVED BY COMMISSIONER MILLS, SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN. WE ARE IN DISCUSSION. COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN.
02:43:08.462: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR. I -- I GUESS BIG PICTURE ON THE REZONING IN PARTICULAR, I DON'T THINK I HAVE QUALMS WITH THIS. I THINK THE LAST THREE MONTHS, SHOWED US THE FLEXIBILITY. THE ADDED FLEXIBILITY, I THINK IS A BENEFIT. AND THEN THE TRADEOFFS HERE, YOU KNOW, AN EXTRA 5 FEET OF HEIGHT AND ANOTHER 19 HOTEL ROOMS OVER FOUR AND A HALF ACRES WHICH DOESN'T GIVE ME A LOT OF HEARTBURN. I THINK BIG PICTURE ON THE REZONING, I'M PRETTY COMFORTABLE WITH. WHERE I DO HAVE SOME PAUSE OR CONCERN IS SOME OF THE DETAILS WITH RESPECT TO SITE PLAN AND SO I JUST WANT TO, LIKE, TOUCH ON THOSE -- I GUESS, TWO OR THREE AREAS, IF I COULD. THE FIRST IS WITH RESPECT TO KIND OF ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN. I'M NOT SURE IF THIS IS ONE OR TWO ITEMS, BUT YOU KNOW, WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME AS A BODY TALKING ABOUT TRYING TO GET THE FRONTAGE OF OUR MAJOR CORRIDORS TO -- YOU KNOW, TO -- FOR BUILDS TO RESPECT THAT FRONTAGE. THAT WE REALLY WANT TO CREATE AN ACTIVE AND WELCOMING STREET FRONT AND I DID SEE THE STAFF REPORT THAT THERE HAVE BEEN PROGRESS IN THE DESIGN ALONG THE WAY TO BETTER KIND OF RESPECT JACKSON BUT IT DOES REALLY STILL FEEL LIKE I WOULD TELL B, I GUESS THE HOTEL TWO, IT FEELS LIKE IT'S AN EMERGENCY ESCAPE, THAT EXITS ON TO JACKSON. AND, YOU KNOW, JACKSON ISN'T THE FLASHIEST AND THE FANCIEST ENTRYWAY AND GATEWAY INTO OUR COMMUNITY NOW, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE SHOULDN'T ASPIRE FOR IT TO BE IN THE FUTURE. AND SO, YOU KNOW, THAT ORIENTATION GAVES ME SOME PAUSE, AND THE DISCUSSION WITH PETITIONERS. I WOULD LIKE TO EXPLORE THAT. AND THEN THE -- SO I GUESS I WOULD OPEN THAT UP THERE. I WOULD LOVE TO GET A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT ABOUT WHAT DID CHANGE, AND WHAT AREAS FOR OPPORTUNITY THERE MIGHT BE TO BETTER THAT FRONTAGE ON JACKSON. THAT'S DIRECTED TO YOU, MR. KOWALSKI.
02:45:55.696: >> I KNOW THE FRONTAGE ALONG JACKSON ROAD. AT THIS TIME, YEAH, THE ARCHITECTS WOULD LIKE TO CHIME IN AND TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE REVOLUTION AND MAYBE WHY EXACTLY THE FORM AND FUNCTION IS THE WAY IT IS ON THAT HOTEL. SO I WILL KIND OF DEFLECT TO THE ARCHITECTS AT THIS TIME.
02:46:11.045: >> SURE. THIS IS SCOTT BOWERS, WITH BOWERS AND ASSOCIATIONS. ON THAT PARTICULAR END, IF WE GO BACK TO THE RENDERING, REALLY WHAT IT IS, IT'S AN END OF THE ROOM BEING END OF THE HALLWAY AND STAIRWELL. SO WHAT WE HAD DONE WAS ACTUALLY ADD FINISHRATION INTO THE BILLING ON OWL FOUR FLOORS AND UP THE SIDES AND WE ADDED ANOTHER ELEMENT IN THE MIDDLE THAT IS A DARKER COLOR. AND ADDED THOSE WINDOWS THAT GO TO THE STAIRWELL AS WELL AS THE HALLWAY. AND AT THE BOTTOM, WE ENHANCED THE ENTRYWAY OR EXITWAY WITH GLASS DOORS AND A MORE ROBUST GREEN AREA IN FRONT OF THE BUILDING. THAT'S ACTUALLY THE FRONT ENTRANCE.
02:47:09.403: >> GO BACK TWO PAGES.
02:47:11.372: >> THERE YOU GO. SO WE TRIED TO DR LIVEN IT UP AD BRING IT MORE INTO A PUBLIC ENTRANCE RATHER THAN JUST AN EXIT WAY OUT.
02:47:32.927: >> THIS PARCEL PIECE IS NARROW TO GET OFF THE SITE.
02:47:36.230: >> WE ORIGINALLY IN THE RESTAURANT, BUT IT PUSHED THE BUILDING TOO FAR BACK -- PAST OUR SETBACK LINES.
02:47:43.804: >> Councilmember Ackerman: UNDERSTOOD. OKAY. FAIR ENOUGH. AND MAYBE I WILL LEAVE IT TO THE ARCHITECTS IF THEY HAVE ANY IDEAS. I THINK THE OTHER ONE, JUST IS MORE OF A DETAIL, YOU KNOW, JACKSON AVENUE, YOU KNOW, HIGHER SPEED LIMITS RELATIVE TO A LOT OF THE COMMUNITY AND THEN WE SEE KIND OF THE ADJACENT PROPERTY HAVING THE TWO CURB CUTS AND THEN AS YOU GO TO WEST TO EAST, THERE'S ANOTHER CURB CUT IMMEDIATELY AND THEN THERE'S A FOFOURTH AND A FIFTH DOWN THE RD AND IN PRETTY QUICK SUCCESSION AS CARS MOVE FROM EAST TO WEST, FIVE CURB CULTS  CUTS AND I WANO GET A SENSE OF WHAT WAS ENGINEERING ANALYSIS TOWARDS THAT AND MORE EYE TOWARDS SAFETY IN MY MIND.
02:48:46.900: >> THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION. PART OF THE ANSWER IS AS STANDARD PRACTICE IT WAS REVIEWED FOR THE ACCESS AND THE CURB CUTS. OUR ENGINEER LOOKED AT THAT. SHE WAS WAY WITH THAT. ANOTHER POINT REGARDING THAT. THE FIRE MARSHAL HAD INDICATED A STRONG PREFERENCE FOR TWO -- IF NOT A REQUIREMENT. I HAVE TO GO BACK AND LOOK, FOR THE TWO ENTRANCES. THERE ARE AT LEAST FOR THE DRIVE THROUGH WRAP AROUND. SO I MEAN, THAT KIND OF FIXES SOME OF THAT LOCATION IN ITSELF. I MEAN THAT WAS A COMMENT INITIALLY AS FAR AS MOVING IT TO ONE CURB CUT OPEN THAT, SITE, BUT FOR A COUPLE OF THOSE REASONS, WE ENDED UP WITH A DESIGN WE ARE. THE ENGINEER MAY BE -- I'M SORRY, AGAIN, I PO POINT BACK TO THE ARCHITECTS IF THEY WANT TO COMCOMMENT FURTHER. WE ANALYZED IT. THE ADJACENT PRO  PROJECT TO THE LEFT, TO THE WEST THERE, IS OUT OF THE -- THE IMPROVEMENTS IS THEY WILL LOSE ONE OF THEIR CURB CUTS BUT THAT STILL DOESN'T SOLVE THE QUESTION -- OR ANSWER THE QUESTION ABOUT THE TWO CURB CUTS ON THIS SITE. BUT THAT'S ABOUT THE BEST ANSWER AT THIS TIME I CAN GIVE. WE RAN IT BY OUR TRANSPORTATION ENGINEER AND, YEAH I KNOW THIS WAS A REQUEST REGARDING ACCESS FROM THE FIRE MARSHAL REGARDING TWO ACCESS POINTS TO THE SITE.
02:50:17.358: >> Councilmember Ackerman: WAS THERE ANY DISCUSSION OF ONE WAY IN AND ONE WAY OUT?
02:50:20.694: >> NO, NONE.
02:50:22.363: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YEAH, IF THE PETITIONER HAS ANYTHING TO ADD IN TERMS OF --
02:50:26.500: >> YEAH, I DON'T KNOW.
02:50:27.000: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THAT WOULD BE FINE.
02:50:38.679: >> ONE OF THE THINGS WAS TO SEPARATE THE RESTAURANTS TO THE HOTELS, BRAND REQUIREMENTS BECAUSE THEY ARE TWO DIFFERENT FRANCHISES. WE USE THAT TO DIVIDE UP THE PARKING LOTS BETWEEN THE TWO HOTELS. BUT IT WAS A REQUEST OF THE FIRE MARSHAL TO MAINTAIN TWO ENTRANCES.
02:51:03.504: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  I THINK THAT SURFACES MY TWO CONCERNS. I'M VERY CURIOUS AND THE OTHER COLLEAGUES THOUGHTS. SO THANKS FOR THAT FEEDBACK, MR. KOWALSKI AND THE PETITIONER.
02:51:24.425: >> Chair Milshteyn: ALL RIGHT. COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL.
02:51:28.061: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: I'M ALSO FINDING THE FACADE A LITTLE FACTING. THERE ARE A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT COULD -- LACKING. THERE ARE A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT COULD ADDRESS THIS. WE HAVE TAKEN TIME IN OUR DOWNTOWN TO ARTICULATE WHAT IS HAPPENING AT THE GROUND FLOOR AND I THINK THERE COULD BE THAT, YOU KNOW, BASE LEVEL THAT'S GRAY. WE HAVE -- SOMETHING THAT WE DISCUSSED IN THE PAST A LOT IS HAVING MORE TRANSPARENCY. AND I THINK HAVING MORE WINDOWS THIS WOULD REALLY HELP THAT TO BE ABLE TO MAKE IT FEEL LIKE IT'S RESPONDING TO A PEDESTRIAN MORE, AND THAT -- I THINK THAT'S PART OF THE ISSUE IS THAT THERE'S SOME BIG BLANK SPOTS THERE. AND THEN THE OTHER THING THAT I SEE IS STREET TREES DON'T HAVE MUCH RELATIONSHIP TO THE ARCHITECTURE. IF YOU REARRANGE, WOULD PRESENT MORE AS A -- AS A COMPOSED TALBEAU, YOU KNOW, FOR THOSE ON THE STREET. IT JUST FEELS A LITTLE LIKE THERE'S KIND OF LIKE, OKAY, ONE EVERY 40 FEET, YOU KNOW IF IT YOU HAD IT RELATE MORE STRONGLY, THAT I THINK THAT WOULD HELP SOME. THOSE ARE SOME OF MY COMMENTS. I FEEL IT'S COME SOME DISTANCE, BUT IT'S ALSO A ZONING CHANGE. WITH THE ZONING CHANGE, THERE'S LIFT AND IT FEELS LIKE THERE'S SOME ROOM TO BE ABLE TO ASK FOR SOME DIFFERENCES, I THINK, WITH THAT. MY UNDERSTANDING, WHEN YOU HAVE FIRST FLUSH, I THOUGHT YOU HAD TO HAVE LIVE PLANTS AND NOT SEED AND YOUR BIOSWALE. OBVIOUSLY IT MUST HAVE PASSED THROUGH, BUT SOME OF THE -- THE SPECIES THAT I SEE ARE PRETTY SANDY SPECIES AND I HAVE A LITTLE QUESTION ABOUT THAT, I GUESS. BUT IF FEELS LIKE, YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST -- IT'S JUST GOING TO PUSH SEED AROUND WHEN WALTER ISS RUSHING IN THERE AND THAT'S PART OF THE POINT OF HAVING THE LIVE MATERIAL, WHEN VELOCITIES ARE COMING IN AT A FASTER RATE, THAT IT'S MORE STABLE AND I THINK IT WILL LOOK BETTER. SO THAT'S SOMETHING, I GUESS TO CONSIDER AS WELL.
02:54:17.531: >> I DON'T THINK WE HAVE THE LAND SCAPE ARCHITECT TONIGHT TO ADDRESS THE SPECIFICS OF WHAT THEY HAVE SPECIFIED IN THE BIOSWALE AND THE FIRST FLUSH.
02:54:31.645: >> I'M SORRY, I DON'T KNOW THE SPECIFICS EITHER, BUT I KNOW IT WAS REVIEWED, BUT WE CAN CERTAINLY FOLLOW UP ON THAT. I RAISE A GOOD POINT ABOUT THE SEED VERSUS THE PLUGS. I KNOW WE DID HAVE IT REVIEWED AND APPROVED SO WE HAVE TO CONFIRM ON THAT AND, AS WELL AS THE SPECIES COMPOSITION, WHETHER OR NOT THEY CAN WORK IN THAT SOIL.
02:54:52.032: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: YEAH, IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WOULD MAKE ME SAY, OH, MY GOSH, HOLD THIS UP. IT'S JUST SOMETHING TO CHECK ON AND REVIEW AND --
02:55:02.042: >> ABSOLUTELY.
02:55:02.976: >> SOME OF THESE ARE EXISTING STREET TREES.
02:55:06.947: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER WOODS FOLLOWED BY COMMISSIONER BRIGGS.
02:55:09.716: >> Commissioner Woods: I'M WONDERING IF WE CAN PUT THE MAP BACK UP. I STILL HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ENTRANCES TO THE PROPERTY. MY QUESTION IS SOMETIMES THE TRAFFIC ON JACKSON ROAD GETS BACKED UP, THAT WOULD BE TRAVELING, I THINK WESTBOUND. MAYBE IT'S EASTBOUND AS THEY ARE TRYING TO GET ON THE FRONTAGE ROAD TO GET ON I-94. I COULD S SEE SOME BACKUP ALONG YOUR PROPERTY. DOWN WHETHER OR NOT THE TRAFFIC ENGINEERS -- YOU SAID THEY DID NOT SAY ANYTHING ABOUT HAVING, YOU KNOW, ONE-WAY ENTRANCE OR NOT, BUT HAS ANYONE THOUGHT ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THERE MIGHT BE POSSIBLY NO LEFT TURN DURING CERTAIN TIMES OF DAY, WHEN THE TRAFFIC MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT INCREASED ALONG THAT CORRIDOR. IS JACKSON ROAD A STATE ROUTE?
02:56:30.564: >> I FAILED TO MENTION THAT EARLIER. THAT'S A GREAT POINT THAT IT IS UNDER MDOT CONTROL AT THAT POINT. SO LIMITS SEVERELY WHAT WE CAN DO REGARDING ANY JURISDICTION AND, OF COURSE, ULTIMATELY CURB CUTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT, HAVE TO BE RUN THROUGH MDOT AT WELL.
02:56:49.649: >> Commissioner Woods: AT THIS POINT, HAVE THEY LOOKED AT IT AT ALL.
02:56:52.953: >> I DON'T BELIEVE SO. I DOUBT IT. NO.
02:56:55.222: >> Commissioner Woods: OKAY. ALL RIGHT. BECAUSE THAT WOULD JUST BE JUST A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS THAT I WOULD HAVE ABOUT THAT. IT COULD BE KIND OF DIFFICULT TRYING TO COME OUT TO GO TO -- TOWARDS DOWNTOWN ANN ARBOR, ON JACKSON ROAD AT CERTAIN TIMES OF THE DAY AND ALSO THERE'S TRAFFIC COMING ACROSS FROM THE RESIDENTIAL AREA. IT'S SOMETIMES THE PERFECT STORM? THATIN THAT AREA THAT YOU MIGHTO BE AWARE OF.
02:57:34.127: >> THERE MAY HAVE BEEN SOME CONVERSATIONS. OUR TRAFFIC ENGINEERING IS IN TOUCH WITH MDOT AND I KNOW SHE HAS -- SHE PROBABLY HAS TOLD THEM ABOUT THIS PROJECT IN PARTICULAR, BECAUSE IN MY CONVERSATION SHE MENTIONED THE SIDEWALK AND HOW MHAD INQUIRED. I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH THEY REVIEWED THE ACTUAL PLAN BUT I THINK THEY ARE AWARE OF IT, AT LEAST ON A PRELIMINARY BASIS BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY THEY WILL NEED THEIR APPROVALS FROM MDOT AS WELL.
02:58:02.189: >> Commissioner Woods: OKAY. THANK YOU.
02:58:04.124: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER BRIGGS.
02:58:05.659: >> Commissioner Briggs: YEAH, COULD WE SEE THE PICTURE OF THE FRONT, THE JACKSON-FACING FACADE? THE ONE THAT SHOWS IT MORE IN -- YEAH. SO I'M WONDERING AS I'M LOOKING AT THIS, I THINK ONE OF THE REASONS THAT IT ALSO DOESN'T FEEL PARTICULARLY FRONT FACING, THE SIDEWALK THAT'S COMING OUT OF THE BUILD IS REALLY DIRECTED TOWARDS THE PARKING LOT AS OPPOSED TO ALSO CONNECTING TO THE SIDEWALK IN FRONT OF THE BUILDING. AND SO I THINK ONE WAY TO MAKE IT FEEL LIKE IT'S CONNECTED SO THAT STREET FACE IS TO ACTUALLY CONNECT IT TO IT. AND THEN PERHAPS PART OF IT IS ALSO CREATING SOME OF THOSE ACCENTS THAT ARE PART OF THE FRONT ACCENTS BRINGING THEM AROUND ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BUILDING MIGHT HELP A LITTLE BIT. BUT THE OTHER QUESTION I HAD WAS AROUND LIGHTING. AND I SUSPECT THE LIGHTING IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH OUR CURRENT ORDINANCE AND THEN THE CANOPY LIGHTING. JUST FYI, IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S FULLY BLOCKED THERE. I'M JUST NOT SURE WHAT SORT OF THE INTENSITY OF THAT IS, IF YOU HAVE ANY SORT OF -- THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS WE ARE ACTUALLY MOVING TOWARDS, TRYING TO REGULATE IS THE FOOT CANDLES S. CANDLES.IS IT AN INTENSE BRIGHTR ACCENT LIGHT AS YOU ARE WALKING IN?
03:00:01.942: >> IF I COULD ANSWER THAT. IF WE START WITH THE HOME TO ENTRANCE. WE WOULD HAVE LINKED UP. WE ARE THREE OR FOUR FEET BELOW THE SIDEWALK. THERE'S ACTUALLY A RETAINING WALL.
03:00:13.486: >> Commissioner Briggs: GOT IT.
03:00:14.421: >> WE WANTED IT TO LINK UP, BUT WE ENDED UP WITH A STAIRS AND RAMPS AND IT WAS NOT A GOOD SITUATION IN THIS, BUT THERE IS A RETAINING WALL BETWEEN THAT AND THE SIDEWALK.
03:00:29.302: >> Commissioner Briggs: IS THERE ANY OPPORTUNITY TO LINK ANOTHER -- IN SOME OTHER WAY TO PROVIDE THAT SENSE OF LINKAGE?
03:00:38.011: >> WE COULD PROBABLY CONTINUE IT ON IN AND SECT U CONNECT UP ON E OTHER SIDE OF THE DRIVEWAY, WHERE THE SIDEWALK WILL GO
03:00:49.389: >> Commissioner Briggs: PERSONAL LY THERE, I THINK THAT MIGHT HELP QUITE A BIT.
03:00:54.327: >> AND THEN NUMBER TWO, THE INTENSITY OF THAT LIGHTING. THAT'S JUST A GLOW. THOSE ARE JUST GLASS PANELS. YOU ONLY SEE IT WHEN YOU ARE UNDER IT.
03:01:17.417: >> Commissioner Briggs: AND THEN THE ONE ON THE BUILDING ITSELF. IS THERE A LIGHT ON THE BUILDING, NOT THAT ONE.
03:01:23.423: >> THERE IS ON THE HOME 2, THE BEACON. THAT ONE IS NOT GOING TO BE LIT.
03:01:28.828: >> Commissioner Briggs: OH, IT'S NO THE.
03:01:29.729: >> THAT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WHEN WE HAD OUR NEIGHBORHOOD MEETING, THAT THEY REQUESTED THAT WE DON'T HAVE --
03:01:42.776: >> Commissioner Briggs: PERFECT.
03:01:43.443: >> LIGHT ON TOP OF THE BUILDING THAT THEY CAN SEE IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD.
03:01:47.147: >> Commissioner Briggs: THAT'S GREAT. THANK YOU.
03:01:48.815: >> AND IF I CAN THROW IN THIS AS WELL, ANDY WAKELAND WITH GIFFLE WEBSTER, THE CIVIL ENGINEER ON SITE. WE COULD RUN THE SIDEWALK FROM THE FRONT ENTRANCE TO THE WEST, BUT WE HAVE TO HAVES IN THERE. IT WILL STILL EXHIBIT THE SAME WAY FROM THE STREET BUT IT WON'T BE PROBABLY AN ACCESSIBLE ROUTE BECAUSE THAT DRIVEWAY IS ABOUT N THAT ENTRANCE.
03:02:21.314: >> Commissioner Briggs: MAYBE THE SIDEWALK IS NOT VERY DOABLE.
03:02:23.049: >> WE CAN DO IT WITH STAIRS. IT WILL STILL --
03:02:26.853: >> Commissioner Briggs: YEAH. YEAH. THANK YOU.
03:02:38.331: >> Chair Milshteyn: OTHER DISCUSSION? COMMISSIONER SAUVE, FOLLOWED BY COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT.
03:02:46.639: >> Commissioner Sauve: I GUESS WITH THE SIDEWALK, I'M CURIOUS ABOUT IT PULLING AWAY FROM THE BUILDING ON JACKSON, WITH THE CURVE. IS THAT TO GET MORE LENGTH OR SLOPE OR IS IT INTENDED TO GET PEDESTRIANS CLOSER TO TRAFFIC BEFORE A HIGHWAY ON RAMP.
03:03:03.890: >> I BELIEVE WE ARE TRYING TO SAVE ONE OF THE EXISTING TREES THERE, AS WELL AS MORE GREEN SPACE IN FRONT.
03:03:08.194: >> I THINK YOU CAN'T -- YOU DON'T SEE THAT TREE IN THE RENDERING OR YOU WOULDN'T SEE THE END OF THAT FACADE IN THE THREE-DIMENSIONAL RENDERING.
03:03:18.104: >> Commissioner Sauve: THAT'S EXISTING.
03:03:19.372: >> IT IS REGARDING -- AND OUR LANDSCAPE REVIEW ASKED TO SAVE BECAUSE IT'S A NICE ENOUGH TO WORK AROUND IN THAT LOCATION.
03:03:32.752: >> Commissioner Sauve: OKAY. I'M JUST TRYING TO LOOK AT -- I WAS LOOKING AT AERIALS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S -- THERE'S THE TREE. YEAH, I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND A SECONDARY SIDEWALK THAT WHOLE LENGTH. IT SEEMS LIKE A LOT MORE PAVEMENT FOR NO REAL KIND OF CONNECTIVITY. I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE TWO CURB CUTS IF THOSE COULD BE -- YOU KNOW, IN AND OUT, I THINK THAT WOULD SUFFICE FOR, YOU KNOW, IF THE FIRE MARSHAL NEEDS TO GET IN, THEY CAN OVERRIDE IT AND THEY CAN JUMP IT TO GET TO THE OTHER ONE. DID YOU GUYS DISCUSS ADJACENT PROPERTY OWNER THAT THEIR PARKING LOT ABUTS TO THIS PARKING LOT ON THE NORTHEAST SIDE. YOU SEE THOSE ARE TWO SPOKES OF, LIKE, PARKING LOT WITH THE ANYTIME FITNESS. DULL TALK TDID YOU TALK TO THEMT CONNECTIVITY, AND PROVIDE ACCESS?
03:04:53.733: >> I DON'T THINK AS STAFF, WE DID NOT RECOMMEND THAT. BUT I MEAN -- WE DIDN'T ADDRESS IT. WE DID NOT ADDRESS THAT. IT WAS NOT ADDRESSED IN THE TRAFFIC ENGINEERS AND SO I LET THE ARCHITECTS SPEAK, BUT I KNOW FROM A STAFF POINT OF VIEW, WE DID NOT PURSUE THAT ISSUE.
03:05:15.188: >> NO, WE DID NOT DISCUSS CROSS ACCESS WITH THE ADJACENT C3 ZONING RETAIL SITE.
03:05:25.365: >> Commissioner Sauve: YEAH, I'M HAVING A HARD TIME WITH THE DOUBLE CURB CUTS, ESPECIALLY WITH THE ARGUMENT OF BRANDING. IT'S SOMETHING I CAN'T BE CONCERNED ABOUT HERE, LIKE THE BRANDING OF TWO HOTELS AND EACH ONE GETS ITS OWN CURB CUT BECAUSE OF IT ON A SINGLE PARCEL. THAT'S JUST NOT A SUFFICIENT REASON. SO ONE WAY ACCESS TO REALLY DIMINISH THE AMOUNT OF TRAFFIC CONFLICTS WITH ONE CURB CUT, I WOULD FEEL BETTER WITH, IF THE FIRE MARSHAL CAN ACCOMMODATE THAT. I WOULD INTERESTED IN A CONVERSATION AND IF THAT WOULD BE SUPPORTED BY THE FIRE MARSHAL WITH THE MULTIP MULTIPLE ACCESS.
03:06:13.012: >> IF I CAN SPEAK TO, THAT AS THE CIVIL ENGINEERS. THE OTHER REASON TO HAVE THE DUAL DRIVEWAYS, BASICALLY IF YOU DO MISS THE FIRST DRIVEWAY, COMING FROM THE EAST AND YOU ARE TRYING TO PULL INTO THE SIGN, SAY YOU MISSED THE FIRST ONE AND THE SECOND ONE IS ONLY A ONE WAY OUT, THEN I BELIEVE YOU HAVE TO GO SOMETHING LIKE A HALF MILE, UNLESS YOU TURN --
03:06:35.201: >> THERE'S A MICHIGAN LEFT RIGHT AFTER WEBERS.
03:06:41.374: >> YEAH, I THINK THAT'S AT LEAST A HALF MILE AWAY. SO YOU HAVE TO GO A SIGNIFICANT DISTANCE TO TURN AROUND. THE OTHER THING TO REMEMBER IS THAT MDOT IS PUTTING AN INTERSECTION HERE. WE ARE PUTTING IN SOME TRAFFIC CALMING, SO IT WON'T BE THAT CARS ARE ZIPPING BY. IT WILL BE -- THAT THEY WILL BE QUEUING UP THERE AND A SLOWER AREA NOW.
03:07:07.300: >> Commissioner Sauve: I THINK THERE'S ENOUGH SITES WITH ONE CURB C CUT THAT IF SOMEBODY MISS IT, THEY HAVE TO GO AROUND. SO MAKING CASES FOR DOUBLE CURB CUT ON EVERY SITE FOR MISSING AN ACCESS POINT REALLY DOESN'T KIND OF SUPPORT LOGIC OF WHAT WE WANT TO SEE IN SITES AROUND TOWN AS MUCH EITHER. I WOULD BE INTERESTED TO HEAR WHAT OTHER COMMISSIONERS HAVE TO SAY. I THINK HOME 2 IS A LITTLE LAST LUSTER, AND HAVING THE STAIRS STAIRSPROTRUDE OUT SO THERE'S SE FACADE CHANGE. AND THE TRANSFORMER JUST HAS VEGETATION SCREENING AROUND IT FOR THE HOTEL 2 -- OR HOME 2. AND THERE'S NO OTHER SCREENING, IS THAT TRUE? CAN YOU TELL ME A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT VEGETATION? SORRY, I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT EXACTLY THE DETAILS. SINCE THAT IS SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD SEE FROM THE SIDEWALK. AT THAT SECOND CURB CUT.
03:08:25.578: >> THEY ARE TYPICALLY SCREENED IN WITH VEGETATION.
03:08:29.282: >> WHAT IS THE VEGETATION?
03:08:30.650: >> A PINE TREE.
03:08:32.618: >> EVERGREEN.
03:08:33.386: >> EVERGREEN, YEAH.
03:08:33.853: >> AND THE HEIGHT?
03:08:36.823: >> I BELIEVE IT'S AROUND 4 TO 5 FEET, BUT I WOULD HAVE TO VERIFY THAT, IT'S A HUGO PINE.
03:08:46.732: >> Commissioner Sauve: OKAY. IT'S ONE OF THOSE TRICKY THINGS, LIKE THE BACK OF THE HOUSE IS AT THE FRONT OF THE STREET INSTEAD OF TRYING TO WORK TOWARDS THE BACK OF THE BUILDING AND SO IT'S JUST A UTILITY THING THAT MEETS THE STREET FRONT TOO, WHICH IS A LITTLE CONCERNING.
03:09:02.682: >> YES, UNFORTUNATELY THE BACK OF THAT BUILDING IS THE FRONT OF THE OTHER BUILDING TOO. SO I THINK WE'RE TRYING TO TOY EXACTLY WHERE THE BEST SPOT WOULD BE TO PUT IT?
03:09:16.028: >> MM-HMM.
03:09:28.307: >> Commissioner Sauve: THOSE ARE MY QUESTIONS.
03:09:30.009: >> AND THE STAIR DOES PROTRUDE.
03:09:34.547: >> Commissioner Sauve: 2 FEET? MAYBE 3? IT'S A LITTLE -- JUST A LITTLE BUMP.
03:09:41.420: >> A GOOD SHADOW NOT DEPICTED IN THE RENDERING.
03:09:47.660: >> Commissioner Sauve: OKAY.
03:09:48.261: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT.
03:09:50.496: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: I HAD THE SAME QUESTION ABOUT THE BEND IN THE SIDEWALK. SO THANK YOU. BUT I -- IS THE AERIAL VIEW -- I MEAN, THE 3D RENDERING MADE IT LOOK LIKE IT WAS RIGHT ADJACENT TO THE ROAD, BUT IS THIS A GREEN SPACE BUFFER IN BETWEEN WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS AND THE ACTUAL STREET? YES? OKAY. THANK YOU. I TEND TO AGREE WITH THE STREET-FACING THOUGHT. ONE RANDOM THOUGHT I HAD WAS A PLAZA WITH SOME SORT OF BUILT-IN BENCH. I DON'T KNOW, IT DEFI DEFINITELY FEELS LIKE IT'S THE ENTRANCE OF A HOTEL AND I'M VERY MUCH IN FAVOR OF, YOU KNOW, MAYBE NOW JACKSON IS NOT THE MOST PLEASANT ROAD TO WALK DOWN BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE SHOULDN'T BE TRYING AS MANY STRIDES AS POSSIBLE TO MAKE IT FEEL LIKE A WALKABLE CORRIDOR. AND I'M NOT A FAN OF CURB CUTS. WAS THERE ANY CONVERSATION WITH THE OWNERS OF THE PARCEL TO THE WEST OR MR. KOWALSKI, YOU MENTIONED THAT MIGHT BE UP FOR DEVELOPMENT, LIKE A SHARED DRIVEWAY OR IS THAT THE CURB CUT THAT MIGHT BE ELIMINATED? LIKE, THAT'S JUST VERY CLOSE, THE EXISTING CURB CULT TO THE CE PROPOSED CURB CUT. RIGHT?
03:11:19.685: >> YES, I MEAN THE ONE TO THE FAR -- THE LEFT IS THEY HAVE IT BLOCKED OFF RIGHT NOW, ACTUALLY, THE SITE OWNER HAS BLOCKED OFF THEIR CURB, BUT THIS ONE IS GOING TO BE -- THE ONE TO THE EAST, THAT'S CURRENTLY OPENED WILL BE REDUCED IN SIZE, QUITE A BIT, BECAUSE IT ACTUALLY -- IT ENCROACHED QUITE A BIT ON TO THIS PROPERTY, AS WELL. SO THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO REDUCE THE SIZE OF THAT CURB CUT AS WELL.
03:11:46.912: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: SO THAT'S THE ONE THEY ARE KEEPING?
03:11:49.015: >> I WOULD ASSUME SO, BUT, AGAIN, KEEP IN MIND THAT MDOT HAS AHE  A LOT OF CONTROL OVER . SO WE DON'T KNOW THAT EXACTLY BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THEY HAD THEIR FINAL DESIGN -- AND IF THEY DO, I DON'T KNOW IT.
03:12:01.627: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: I'M WONDERING IF THAT'S THE ONE THEY ARE KEEPING IF THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO A SHARED DRIVE SO YOU DON'T HAVE A CURB CUT TWO FEET OF SIDEWALK AND A CURB CUT.
03:12:10.736: >> I THINK THERE'S A GRADE CHANGE THIS AS WELL, IF I'M CORRECT BUT, AGAIN, THE ENGINEER COULD MAYBE SPEAK TO THAT. I THINK THEY HAVE A RETAINING WALL BETWEEN THOSE TWO SITES BUT I COULD BE WRONG ON THAT UP WITH. THAT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING WE CAN ASK THEM TO EXPLORE. I KNOW AT THIS POINT, IT WASN'T SOMETHING THAT PLANNING STAFF HAD ASKED THEM TO RESEARCH REGARDING THE ADJACENT SITE. I DON'T EVEN THINK IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE IF THEY LOSE PARKING, THEY -- BUT WE CAN CERTAINLY ASK THEM.
03:12:41.867: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: THAT'S TRUE ON THE PARKING.
03:12:45.104: >> THAT SITE IS A LITTLE SMALL FOR THAT. THE ONE TO THE EAST IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT, I THINK.
03:12:51.777: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: THERE IS A GRADE CHANGE, IS IT POSSIBLE TO EXTEND THE SOMEWHAT YOU CAN?
03:12:55.381: >> YES. BUT, AGAIN, I'M NOT 100% SURE OF THAT EXACT GRADE CHANGE BUT THERE IS A SMALL RETAINING WALL THERE.
03:13:02.521: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: OKAY.
03:13:03.456: >> IS THE ENGINEERING, THE ARCHITECT, ANDY WAKELAND, ISN'T THERE A RETAINING WALL ONE THOSE TWO SITES?
03:13:10.362: >> YES, THERE IS. WE ARE ACTUALLY REDOING THE RETAINING WALL IN SOME AREAS. ON THE SITE TO THE EAST, I BELIEVE THE -- IT GETS A LITTLE HIGHER AS YOU GO FARTHER BACK INTO THE SITE, COMPARED TO OUR SITE. RIGHT AT THE DRIVEWAY, IT'S ABOUT A HALF A FOOT OR FOOT DIFFERENCE, BUT 20 FEET IN, YOU ARE ABOUT 3-FOOT IN HEIGHT ELEVATION DIFFERENT. SO A SIDEWALK WOULD WORK, BUT IF YOU WERE TO TRY TO MAKE A DRIVEWAY THAT WOULD COME IN AND WRAP AROUND, THEN IT WOULD GET REALLY WONKY.
03:13:48.601: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: OKAY. I THINK I WOULD BE IN FAVOR OF A ONE WAY IN AND ONE WAY OUT. AND IN THE TRAFFIC ON JACKSON IS GOING TO BE SLOWED AND THEN THE ARGUMENT OF MISSING A DRIVEWAY IS LESS COMPELLING TO ME TOO. AND LIKE EVERYONE BEFORE ME, I'M INTERESTED IN HEARING OTHER'S THOUGHTS.
03:14:17.229: >> Chair Milshteyn: I USED TO LIVE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. I BELIEVE IT'S THE AUTO REPAIR OR MUFFLER REPAIR THAT'S ON 94 EASTBOUND AND JACKSON. THE REASON THEY BLOCKED OFF ONE OF THEIR ENTRANCES IS BECAUSE THERE IS SO MUCH TRAFFIC ON JACKSON ROAD, THAT PEOPLE WHO WERE COMING EASTBOUND ON JACKSON WOULD EVENTUALLY GIVE UP ON THE TURN LANE AND JUST DRIVE AROUND, TURN INTO THE B MUFFLER SHOP, TN AROUND AND GET ON I-94 EAST. THAT WAS A BIG PROBLEM. AND NOW I'M ACTUALLY SEEING THAT SAME ACTIVITY HAPPENING -- I SHOULDN'T SAY NOW. PRIOR TO MIDDLE OF MARCH, I WAS SAYING THAT ACTIVITY HAPPENING AS THEY WERE GOING INTO THE ANYTIME FITNESS PLAZA AS WELL AND I ALSO SAW SOME INTERESTING TURNAROUNDS AT  SOLEMBERG CAFE S WELL. THAT AREA IS NOT GREAT FOR GETTING ON TO 94 EASTBOUND. I'M CONCERNED WITH TWO CURB CUTS THERE, THAT IT WILL BE PEOPLE CIRCLING IN AND DRIVING AROUND AND PULLING RIGHT OUT TO GET ON TO 94 EASTBOUND. I THINK THAT WILL BE A PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL ISSUE FOR THIS SITE. SO TRAFFIC -- I THINK IT'S -- IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT. WITH REGARDS TO THE LOOK OF IT, IS THAT, YOU KNOW, I KNOW PEOPLE ARE SAYING THIS ISN'T REALLY WALKABLE BUT ON FOOTBALL SATURDAYS, YOU OFTEN SEE PEOPLE WALKING DOWN FROM THE OTHER HOTELS, FROM WEBERS AND THE OTHER HOTELS NEARBY. THEY ARE WALKING DOWN THE SITE AND SO IT IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE WALKABLE THE MORE HOTELS THAT ARE BUILT, AND RIGHT NOW, THIS ISN'T A WHOLE LOT TO TAKE -- A WHOLE LOT TO SEE THERE. SO THE CURB APPEAL OF THE HOTEL, I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT, AND I -- YOU KNOW, I UNDERSTAND THE LIMITATIONS OF SITE, BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I THINK THERE'S GOT TO BE MORE AND I'M NOT AN ARCHITECT. I'M NOT GOING TO DICTATE AND SIGH SAYWHAT I WANT TO SEE. BUT IT HAS TO BE WHERE IT LOOKS MORE LIKE A FRONT FACING BUSINESS WHERE SOMEONE DOESN'T WWALK BY IT AND THINK I'M STANDING IN THE ALLEY OF A HOTEL. THERE'S SOMETHING MORE THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE WITH THAT. FURTHER DISCUSSION? COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL?
03:16:48.113: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: I HAVE ONE OTHER ISSUE WITH THE DRIVES IS THAT THE JUNIPERS THAT ARE THERE, THEY ARE TOTALLY IN THE -- IN THE VIEW OF CARS -- THEY ARE GETTING IN THE WAY OF DRIVERS LOOKING OUT INTO THE ROAD. THESE ARE SKY ROCK ELIMINATE SKS THAT GET TO BE 15 TO 20 FEET TALL AND THEY ARE RIGHT BEFORE THE SIDEWALK. WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS CARS ARE GOING TO PULL UP TO LOOK OUT ON TO JACKSON AND THEY WILL HAVE TO PULL OUT WAY OUT FURTHER THAN THEY NORMAL WOULD HAVE TO, IN ORDER TO GET PAST THOSE SKYROCKET JUNIPERS WHICH ARE PLANTED AS IF THEY ARE A HEDGE AND SO YOU ARE EFFECTIVELY CREATING A WALL OF EVERGREENS RIGHT THERE FOR PEOPLE. SO I CAN'T QUITE GET HOW THE -- YOU KNOW, YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO -- THERE'S ALL THE TRAFFIC CONES AND THINGS LIKE THAT IN TERMS OF YOUR CONE OF VISION THAT YOU SEE BASED ON WHAT THE SPEEDS OF THE ROAD ARE AND STUFF LIKE THAT, AND I TOTALLY CAN GET DECIDUOUS TREES AS LONG AS I THINK THE CITY CODE IS THEY HAVE TO BE LIMITED UP 8 FEET BUT THE SKYROCKET JUNIPERS WILL BE A WALL THERE. SO THAT'S ANOTHER JUST MORE -- MORE ISSUES AROUND THE ENTRIES, ESPECIALLY IN TERMS OF PEDESTRIAN SAFETY IN THROUGH THERE. SO PERHAPS THAT'S SOMETHING IF YOU WILL WANT EVERGREEN, THAT COULD BE A LOWER SPECIES THAT WOULDN'T BE IN CONFLICT WITH SITE DISTANCE AS PEOPLE ARE PULLING INTO THAT -- PULLING UP TO LEAVE, ESPECIALLY.
03:18:39.892: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER MILLS.
03:18:41.460: >> Vice Chair Mills: I WANTED TO CHIME IN KIND OF COMING BACK FULL CIRCLE PERHAPS TO WHERE COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN STARTED WHICH IS I THINK IN TERMS OF THE REZONING OF THIS PROPERTY, THIS IS THE BETTER ZONING DISTRICT. WHAT YOU HAVE PROPOSED, I THINK IS A BETTER ZONING DISTRICT IN PART BECAUSE IT ALLOWS FOR IN FLEXIBILITY AND EVEN THOUGH RIGHT NOW, WHAT IS -- WHAT IS BEING PROPOSED IS HOTEL USES, WHICH YOU COULD DO IN THE EXISTING ZONES, I -- I MEAN, I DON'T -- I THINK -- I THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO MOVE TO A DISTRICT HERE THAT MAY ALLOW FOR SOME MORE FLEXIBILITY IN THE FUTURE. AND SO I LIKE THE IDEA OF REZONING THIS. I ALSO, THOUGH, RECOGNIZE THAT REZONING ALLOWS FOR ADDITIONAL KIND OF DEVELOPMENT HERE. AND SO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF -- WELL, FIRST OF ALL, THE EXTENDING OF THE SIDEWALK, I THINK IS FANTASTIC! AND I APPRECIATE THAT AND I THINK THAT RIGHT NOW, THERE AREN'T PEDESTRIANS HERE BECAUSE THERE ARE NOT -- THERE'S NOT A CONNECTIVITY OR, I MOAN, THERE'S THERE'S -- I MEAN THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A FOOT PATH THERE, BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE OF THAT IN THE FUTURE. I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT AS PART OF THIS. I THINK AS THE OTHER COMMISSIONERS SAID, KIND OF DESIGN, THE INTENTION IS NOT JUST TO HAVE THINGS CLOSE TO THE STREET FOR BEING CLOSE TO THE STREET SAKE, BUT TO MAKE IT FEEL WELCOMING AND YOU CAN WALK IN THAT DOOR. OR AT LEAST WALK OUT THAT DOOR, LIKE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE STAYING THERE CAN WALK OUT THAT DOOR AND GET ON TO THE SIDEWALK. I HAVE THINK THE LOOK OF THAT, I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT. I'M TORN. I MEAN I DON'T LIKE CURB CULTS S THAN ANYBODY ELSE. I'M MORE OFTEN ON THE SIDEWALKS OR THE BIKE LANES THAN I AM IN THE CAR. THIS ONE, I THINK IS TRICKY JUST LIKE HOW YOU WOULD GET AROUND AND SO THINKING ABOUT HOW TO WORK WITH THE NEIGHBORS OR ONE WAYS TO MAKE THAT A LITTLE BIT NARROWER, WHAT COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL JUST SAID ABOUT -- ABOUT THE LANDSCAPE THAT'S PLANTED, LIKE THIS IS THE LANDSCAPING AND NEEDING TO EFFECTIVELY, LIKE, PULL OUT, PARTICULARLY IF IT'S LIKE INTO THE SIDEWALK, I THINK THAT'S CONCERNING. ESPECIALLY, LIKE, THIS IS GOING TO BE TRICKY FOR THOSE DRIVERS, CLEARLY, BUT IT'S ALSO GOING TO BE TRICKY FOR THE PEDESTRIANS WHO ARE NAVIGATING THIS AS WELL. SO NECESSARILY KNOW ANYTHING TO ADD, BUT SO MUCH OF IT HAS BEEN ABOUT THE SITE PLAN THAT I JUST THOUGHT I WOULD CHIME IN TO SAY, LIKE, I DO THINK THAT THIS IS THE RIGHT -- THAT THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE REZONING FOR THIS PARTICULAR PROPERTY.
03:21:36.435: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER ABRONS.
03:21:38.470: >> Commissioner Abrons:  I DON'T HAVE AL A LOT TO ADD. MAYBE ONE ADDITIONAL MEASURE THAT COULD HELP THE TRAFFIC FLOW IN AND OUT IS LIKE A RIGHT TURN ONLY COMING OUT OF THE DRIVEWAY. I MEAN, I THINK IT WILL BE REALLY HARD TO MAKE A LEFT TURN OUT OF THAT HOTEL ON TO JACKSON ANYWAY. THAT'S WHAT I EXPERIENCE I GUESS A LITTLE BIT FURTHER TO THE EAST BUT IF HE BANK OF AMERICA, OFTEN HAVING TO MAKE A RIGHT AND I THINK THE MICHIGAN LEFT AT WEBER ACTUALLY MAKES IT KIND OF CONVENIENT TO DO THAT. THAT'S ONE SUGGESTION. IN TERMS OF THE JACKSON FRONTAGE, I MEAN, I APPRECIATE THAT IT'S -- YOU KNOW, THE STREET FRONTAGE IS NARROW THERE. YOU ARE TRYING TO FIT TWO DRIVEWAYS AND A FACADE AND I THINK THE FACT THAT ALL OF US ARE UNHAPPY BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE THE BACK OF A BUILDING IS BECAUSE IT IS THE -- IT IS THE BACK OF THE BUILDING AND I THINK THERE'S NO WAY TO KIND OF ORIENT THE FRONT OF THE HOTEL ON JACKSON, BUT I THINK ANY MEASURES THAT WOULD BE TAKEN TO HAVE THAT FEEL MORE LIKE A FRONT I THINK WOULD BE APPRECIATED BY EVERYBODY HERE. I AGREE WITH I MANY COLLEAGUES. ACTUALLY, SORRY, I FORGOT ONE OTHER THING. I JUST WONDERED AND MAYBE SHANNAN CAN HELP TO BRAINSTORM THIS. COULD LANDSCAPING DO WHAT THE ARCHITECTURE CAN'T DO ON THAT JACKSON FACE? I MEAN, BECAUSE IT IS AN EGRESS STAIR, AND THERE'S NOT THAT MUCH THAT CAN REALLY HAPPEN THERE BUT MAYBE THERE'S SOME CREATIVE THINGS THAT LANDSCAPING COULD DO TO MAKE THAT A MORE ATTRACTIVE FACADE?
03:23:27.079: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: I AGREE. THERE DEFINITELY COULD BE SOME THINGS TO GIVE IT A LITTLE MORE DETAIL. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT LITTLE TINY PERENNIALS BUT IT FEELS A LITTLE BLAND. SO SOMETHING ALONG THAT FACE, I THINK WOULD BE ICE NICE AND SOME SIMPLE REORIENTING OF THE TREES WOULD HELP TO HONOR THE FACADE A LITTLE BIT MORE IN TERMS OF THE GEOMETRY OR SOMETHING AT THE BASE ARE SOMETHING LIKE THAT. WE OFTEN COME IN TO DO THE BAND AIDS WITH THE LANDSCAPE, OR THE LACK OF ARCHITECTURAL DETAIL, AND SO JUST SOMETIMES EVEN SIMPLY PUTTING THINGS IN THE BLANK SPACES CAN HELP A LOT. SO I GUESS THOSE ARE SOME THINGS TO EXPLORE BUT I THINK THAT ADDING SOME MORE DETAIL THERE, AND I KNOW YOU HAVE A LARGER PATIO AREA THERE TOO, THAT YOU HAVE, YOU KNOW, SOMEWHAT LIMITED AREA IN WHICH TO WORK, BUT I THINK THINGS NEXT TO THE SIDEWALK COULD EVEN HELP QUITE A BIT IN THROUGH THERE. SO THAT'S SOMETHING TO CONSIDER TO BE ABLE TO -- TO JUST MAKE IT A LITTLE MORE INTERESTING.
03:24:36.615: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN.
03:24:37.549: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: ONE OTHER THING TOO. JUST, YOU KNOW, MOGO PINE ARE ONE OF THE SLOWEST GROWING THINGS OUT THERE. THEY TAKE FOREVER. THAT BEING YOUR TRANSFORMER SCREEN IS JUST GOING TO BE A LONG, LONG SLOG, AND SO JUST, AGAIN, PICKING A SPECIES THAT JUST FEELS LIKE IT'S GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE IMMEDIATE, I THINK WOULD BE A SMARTER CHOICE.
03:25:04.176: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN AND COMMISSIONER BRIGGS. OH, COMMISSIONER BRIGGS.
03:25:09.214: >> Commissioner Briggs: THIS QUESTION IS MORE FOR CITY STAFF? TERMS OF CONNECTIVITY TRANSPORTATIONWISE. OBVIOUSLY, MOST FOLKS WILL BE COMING TO THIS SITE WITH AN AUTOMOBILE, BUT BECAUSE THERE IS ESPECIALLY SINCE THERE'S AN EXTENDED STAY HOTEL THERE. I KNOW WE ARE WORKING TO GET A SIDEWALK ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROAD, BUT IN TERMS OF TRANSIT, IT'S OBVIOUSLY REALLY HARD TO GET ACROSS HERE. AND IF MDOT -- I MEAN, THIS IS JUST GOING TO -- IT'S GOING TO BE CHALLENGING FOR SOMETIME, BUT BECAUSE MDOT IS THINKING ABOUT DOING SOME WORK, IS THERE AT LEAST ANY WAY TO START PUSHING THEM TO THINK ABOUT SOME SORT OF CONNECTIVITY IN THAT AREA, AT LEAST START RAISING THE CONVERSATION WITH THEM OR HAS THAT CONVERSATION BEEN STARTED. I WAS JUST --
03:26:01.766: >> SO I CAN COMMENT A LITTLE BIT AND I'M SORRY, I MIGHT HAVE MISSTHE FIRST PART. I WAS COMMUNICATING WITH OUR TRAFFIC ENG BE NEAR RIGHT NOW AS WE SPOKE. MERSKYTHEY ARE ADDING AIL TRAFFC LIGHT TO THE EASTBOUND ENTRANCE RAMP. WITH A CROSSWALK.
03:26:19.951: >> Commissioner Briggs: OH, OKAY.
03:26:20.752: >> SO I APOLOGIZE IF I -- I WAS FRANTICALLY -- YES. AND SHE -- SHE -- I'M LOOKING AT MY TEXT. YES, THEY HAVE COMMITTED NOT CROSSWALK IF WE WERE COMMITTING THE -- WE AS A CITY COMMITTING TO FILL THE SIDEWALK GAP. THEY WILL HAVE A SIGNAL LIGHT AND A CROSSWALK. IT'S CURRENTLY IN DESIGN PHASE RIGHT NOW.
03:26:49.381: >> Commissioner Briggs: THAT'S WONDERFUL.
03:26:50.482: >> AND, AGAIN, I APOLOGIZE FOR COMING AT THAT A LITTLE BIT LATER, BUT TRYING TO COMMUNICATE HERE. I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT MAY AFFECT OTHER COMMISSION VIEW POINTS OR DISCUSSION ITEMS.
03:27:00.959: >> Commissioner Briggs: THAT'S A BETTER ANSWER THAN I EXPECTED. THANK YOU.
03:27:04.396: >> WOW, THAT'S GREAT! I WILL TAKE THAT.
03:27:15.006: >> Chair Milshteyn: KNOWING THAT, I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A MORE PEDESTRIAN FRIENDLY FACADE BECAUSE IT WILL BECOME MORE PEDESTRIAN FRIENDLY. COMMISSIONER WOODS.
03:27:26.718: >> Commissioner Woods: I THINK THAT IS GREAT NEWS AND IT MAKES ME MORE INCLINED TO VOTE IN FAVOR OF THIS PROJECT BECAUSE THAT WAS THE BIGGEST CONCERN I HAD. JUST THINKING ABOUT THE END OF THE BUILDING RIGHT, THERE I MEAN IF THERE'S ANYTHING, I'M NOT AN ARCHITECT EITHER, BUT IS THERE ANY WAY YOU CAN DO SOMETHING WITH MAYBE SOME GLASS OR SOME OF THAT COLOR PALATE YOU SHOWED US EARLY, JUST SO PEOPLE ARE COMING INTO ANN ARBOR OR LEAVING ANN ARBOR, THEY SAY, WOW, THAT'S ONE OF THE BEST LOOKING BUILDINGS I HAVE SEEN IN A LONG TIME! YOU WILL HAVE -- YOU KNOW, YOU WILL MAKE US HAPPY AND YOU WILL MAKE PEOPLE GETTING READY TO ON THE HIGHWAY HAPPY AS WELL. SO JUST WANT TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO SOMETHING WITH THAT.
03:28:12.364: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN.
03:28:14.466: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  I DON'T WANT TO SHUT DOWN DEBATE BUT I FELL LIKE WE HAVE CONVALESCED AROUND SOME CENTRAL ISSUES THAT SEEM CORE TO THIS. AND IT FEELS LIKE POSTPONE WOULD BE MOST APPROPRIATE. IT SEEMS LIKE YOU GUYS WANT TO SEE ANOTHER DRAFT OF THIS. I THINK I WOULD TOO. TURNING INTO THE PETITIONER AND THE STAFF LISTENING TO OUR COMMENTS AROUND THE SOUTH ELEVATION FACADE OF HOTEL B AND THEN THE CURB CUTS AND THE ENTRY MOVEMENTS, AND EXIT MOVEMENTS AND THEN THE LANDSCAPING. HOW MUCH TIME WOULD THAT TAKE? AND I MISSED ANYTHING, ALEX, PLEASE.
03:28:59.344: >> TIME TO TAKE TO UPDATE THE DRAWINGS IS THAT WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT?
03:29:05.083: >> WELL, CHRIS ABEL WITH THE DEVELOPMENT TEAM IS ON AS WELL. I WOULD SAY WE CAN GET THAT DONE WITHIN TWO WEEKS. OR QUICKER.
03:29:16.394: >> Councilmember Ackerman: AND THEN STAFF REVIEW TIME?
03:29:20.231: >> Planning Manager:  WELL, IF YOU WANTED POSTPONE, I'M THINKING THAT CAN HE COULD SHOOT A MONTH FROM NOW. I'M PRESUMING THAT IF THIS -- THIS CONFIGURATION HAS ALREADY HAD SOME REVIEW BY TRAFFIC FROM A TECHNICAL PERSPECTIVE, I'M GUESSING THAT THE MODIFICATIONS WOULD BE PRETTY QUICK FOR US TO TURN AROUND. I'M KIND OF LOOKING AT YOU, MATT. I WOULD PROBABLY ONLY PROVIDE ABOUT A WEEK OF SORT OF RALLYING FOLKS FOR REVIEW AND THEN GETTING FEEDBACK BACK TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION IN ADVANCE OF THAT MEETING. IS Z THAT FEEL OKAY? WOULD YOU FEEL LIKE SIX WEEKS WOULD BE BETTER?
03:30:03.708: >> YEAH. I THINK THAT COULD BE OKAY. AS YOU MENTIONED, I MEAN FROM WHAT I'M HEARING TOO, I'M LOOKING AT SOME OF THE LAND SCAPE ITEMS, OF COURSE. AND THEN THE TRAFFIC -- THE CIRCULATION ISSUE AS WELL. SO WHEN THE TRAFFIC ENGINEERING, LIKE YOU SAID, THE SUBSTANCE OF THE PLAN IS NOT CHANGING ESSENTIALLY. WE CAN LOOK INTO THE ONE-WAY ACCESS. SO -- RIGHT. I MEAN, I THINK FROM MY END THAT FEELS CARBONFEELS OKAY.
03:30:28.800: >> Planning Manager:  I PROPOSE THAT WE POSTPONE IT TO THAT AGENDA BUT IF THERE'S MORE TO RENINE, PERHAPS THAT CAN HAPPEN BETWEEN PLANNING COMMISSION AND COUNSEL AND ADDRESS IT THEN. I WOULD RATHER TO GIVE IT A DATE CERTAIN THAN TO KEEP IT OPEN ENDED.
03:30:45.083: >> Councilmember Ackerman: SORE PEOPLE FEELING READY FOR THAT? I WOULD MOVE TO POSTPONE THIS ITEM UNTIL OUR SECOND MEETING IN JUNE.
03:30:54.759: >> Chair Milshteyn: DO WE HAVE A SECOND? SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER WOODS. ANY DISCUSSION ON THE POSTPONEMENT? COMMISSIONER MILLS?
03:31:04.235: >> Vice Chair Mills: I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY THAT IT LOOKED LIKE ONE OF THE PETITIONERS ANDY WANTED TO SAY SOMETHING AND SO I THOUGHT I WOULD GIVE HIM THE OPPORTUNITY IF THAT'S OKAY.
03:31:15.647: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU.
03:31:16.447: >> YES, I WAS GOING TO JUST THROW OUT THERE THE POSSIBILITY THAT WE WORK WITH STAFF BECAUSE I HAVE WORKED WITH TIFFANY IN THE URBAN FORESTRY DEPARTMENT QUITE A BIT TO GET THE PLANTINGS THAT SHE WANTED AND THE TREES ALONG THE FRONTAGE. I THINK WE COULD EASILY CAP OUT THE VARIETIES WITH HER DIRECTION. SO I DEFINITELY WOULDN'T WANT THAT NO HOLD US UP. AND THEN IN TERMS OF THE DUAL DRIVEWAYS, I THINK WE'RE WILLING TO WORK WITH YOU, BUT IT'S GOING TO COME DOWN TO THE FIRE DEPARTMENT REVIEWING AND TELLING US IF WE CAN DO IT OR NOT. SO COULD WE ALSO ALLOW STAFF TO REVIEW THAT AND SAY, YES OR NO. BECAUSE IF THEY ARE NOT GOING TO ALLOW IT, IT WON'T HAPPEN. CAN YOU JUST APPROVE WITH STAFF REVIEW? JUST AN IDEA.
03:32:07.832: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  I THINK WE HAVE ALL SURFACED, LIKE, SOME IDEAS WE HAD ABOUT WHAT POTENTIAL FIXES COULD BE, COMMISSIONER WOODS MENTIONED, YOU KNOW, NO REST LEFT TURNS AT CERTAIN TIMES AND COMMISSIONER ABRONS MENTIONED NO LEFT TURNS. AND A COUPLE OF PEOPLE BROUGHT UP ONE WAY IN AND OUT. I THINK WE ARE ALL -- WE WOULD UNDERSTAND IF STAFF -- IF PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERS SAID THEY ARE NOT VIABLE BUT I THINK WE HAVE NO ASK.
03:32:40.031: >> Chair Milshteyn: OKAY, COMMISSIONER MILLS?
03:32:41.199: >> Vice Chair Mills: AND I WOULD JUST ADD THAT I THINK THAT THERE'S SOME OF THE ARCHITECTURAL THINGS LIKE ON THAT FACADE THAT IS NOT NECESSARILY A STAFF -- I THINK -- IF IT WERE ONLY ABOUT LANDSCAPING AND SWITCHING OUT SPECIES, I WOULD SAY, MOVING THIS FORWARD WITH PROVISIONAL IMPROVEMENT AND MORE DIRECTION BUT I FEEL THAT'S WHERE IT WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL FOR US TO SEE IT AGAIN. SO THAT'S MY KIND OF SENSE ON THAT, BUT I -- I WELCOME OTHERS' OPINIONS ON ET C VOTING ON THE POSTPONEMENT.
03:33:14.666: >> Chair Milshteyn: ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION ON THE POSTPONEMENT? SEEING NONE, ALL THOSE IN FAVOR OF COMMISSIONER -- COMMISSIONER SAUVE.
03:33:24.409: >> Commissioner Sauve: I WOULD JUST SAY, LIKING IN TERMS OF IN THE TWO WEEKS -- YOU ARE NOT GOING TO COME TO AN AGREEMENT WITH THE ADJ ADJACENT PROPERTY OWNER. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME EFFORT OF A CONVERSATION TO SEE WHAT SORT OF INTEREST IT THAT IS. AND I KNOW WE ARE TALKING ABOUT TWO CURB CUTS AND ACCESS FOR FIRE BUT IF THERE HAS NOT EVEN BEEN A CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT AND TALKING ABOUT TWO C CURB CU, I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THAT THERE WERE CONVERSATIONS AND WE DIDN'T LEAVE THAT OFF THE TABLE AS AN OPPORTUNITY.
03:33:59.877: >> I MEAN, I COULD ASK -- I MEAN, I COULD ADD TO, THAT THE OWN THING I WOULD ADD -- THE ONLY THING I WOULD ADD TO THAT, WITH THE ADJACENT PROPERTY, IT WOULD TRIGGER A SITE PLAN FOR THAT ADJACENT PROPERTY.
03:34:13.925: >> Commissioner Sauve: OKAY.
03:34:14.559: >> AND THEY LOSE PARKING BECAUSE OF WHERE THE CONNECTION IS. THAT SITE HAS NEVER BEEN SITE PLANNED AND I DON'T THINK THAT THAT WOULD PROBABLY GO VERY FAR, BUT, I MEAN, WE CAN ASK. UNFORTUNATELY, THE REALITY IT THAT IT WOULD TRIGGER A SITE PLAN ON THE ADJACENT SITE. IT WOULD CHANGE CIRCULATION. IT WOULD CHANGE PARKING.
03:34:34.912: >> Commissioner Sauve: YEAH, I MEAN -- YEAH. I MEAN, EVEN ONE WIDER CURB CUT, YOU KNOW, SO -- SO IT'S OBSTRUCT ADOPTED. I THINK THOSE SORTS OF VARIATIONS DESERVE SOME ATTENTION. I THINK WE HAVE PUSHED ON SITE PLANS BEFORE AND SEEN SOME RADICAL IMPROVEMENTS
