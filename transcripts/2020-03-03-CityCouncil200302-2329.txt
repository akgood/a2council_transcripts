00:02:11.972: >> JUST A COUPLE OF THINGS. ON THE AGENDA IS AN ITEM LATER IN INJURE AGENDA FOR MY APPOINTMENT AS INTERIM. I JUST WOULD TAKE A MOMENT NOW TO SAY I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH COUNCIL, STAFF AND THE COMMUNITY ON THE MANY POLICY ISSUES YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU AND THE CHALLENGES WE HAVE. SO I HOPE IT PASSES, BUT I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO A LOT OF WORK WITH YOU GUYS. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO POINT OUT THERE ARE A COUPLE OF ITEMS THAT GOT ADDED LATE, MEMOS FOR THE ADMINISTRATOR'S COMMUNICATION. JUST WANT TO BRING THOSE TO YOUR ATTENTION. ONE THAT I NOTED WAS THE MRF UPDATE, AND THE NEGOTIATIONS ABOUT THAT. THERE'S AN UPDATE ON THAT, AND THE CENTER OF THE CITY TASK FORCE REPORT, WHICH IS ATTACHED FOR YOU TONIGHT, BUT WE'LL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A PRESENTATION ON THAT AT THE NEXT MEETING, THE MARCH MARCH 16th MEETING. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SHARE COMMUNICATION FROM THE CITY CLERK, REMINDING OUR CITY VOTERS THAT ABSENTEE BALLOTS ARE CURRENTLY BEING ISSUED FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY FOR NO REASON. SO YOU ARE ABLE TO COME WITHOUT A REASON. AND IT'S HELPFUL TO VOTE EARLY. SO THE CITY CLERK'S OFFICE IS OPEN THIS WEEK, INCLUDING SATURDAY, THIS COMING SATURDAY FROM 8 TO 4:00. BALBALLOTS CAN BE MAILED TO VOTS UP TO 5 P.M. THIS FRIDAY. AND I WANT TO THANK OFFICER GILMORE FOR ATTENDING TONIGHT.
00:03:38.992: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. WE NOW HAVE TWO INTRODUCTIONS. FIRST UP, HASNA GHALIB. PLEASE COME AND MEET ME AT THE FRONT.
00:03:59.880: >> YES, EXACTLY. WHERE EXACTLY IS THE FRONT? THE CAMERA IS THERE. SO ONE OF THE REALLY COOL THINGS WE HAVE BEEN DOING WITH THE NEUTRAL ZONE IS IDENTIFYING YOUTH POETS AND ENCOURAGING YOUTH POETRY. AS AN EXAMPLE, WE HAVE AN OUTSTANDING -- AN OUTSTANDING EXAMPLE HERE AND I WOULD LIKE TO READ THE PROCLAMATION. SO WHEREAS THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR AND THE MAYOR'S OFFICE WOULD LIKE TO RECOGNIZE HASNA GHALIB FOR HER APPOINTMENT AS THE ANN ARBOR YOUTH POET LAUREATE FOR 2019, IT RECOGNIZES YOUTH WRITERS AND LEADERS COMMITTED TO CIVIC AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT, POETRY, PERFORMANCE, HUMAN RELATIONS AND DIVERSITY AND EDUCATION. YOUTH VOICE AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT ARE VITAL FOR EMPOWERING YOUNG PEOPLE TO EFFECT POSITIVE CHANGE IN THEIR COMMUNITY AND BEYOND. AND WHEREAS, HASNA GHALIB WAS CHOSEN THROUGH TALENTED YOUTH POETS REQUIRING FIVE ORIGINAL POEMS AND ESSAY FOCUSING ON THE POWER OF POETRY. SHE HAS BEEN PART OF THE NEUTRAL ZONE'S LITERARY ARTS PROGRAM WHERE SHE'S ENCOURAGED AND INSPIRED MULTIPLE PEOPLE WITH HER POEMS. WHEREAS HASNA HAS WRITTEN WITH GRACE, HE WILL AGAINST ABOUT DIFFERENT POLITICAL ISSUES AND GIVEN VOICE TO THE SOCIALLY MORE THANNALLIZED. SHE HAS BECOME IMMERSED IN THE STUDY OF LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE IN ORDER TO CREATE BEAUTIFUL AND POWERFUL LITERARY ART. NOW OF THIS I CHRISTOPHER TAYLOR, MAYOR OF ANN ARBOR MICHIGAN, WOULD LIKE TO HASNA GHALIB AS ANN ARBOR YOUTH POET LAUREATE 2019 FOR GIVING VOICE TO THE YOUTH OF ANN ARBOR. MS. GHALIB. [ APPLAUSE ]
00:05:46.720: >> THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH. THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE HONOR. IT'S SUCH A PLEASURE TO BE HERE AMONG ALSO NOT ONLY THE COUNCILMEMBERS BUT MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY. THANK YOU ALL FOR MAKING TIME TO BE A PART OF SUCH A BEAUTIFUL DISPLAY OF COMMUNITY AS WELL. YEAH. THANK YOU! FOR Y'ALL TODAY, I HAVE A POEM TITLED "IBRAHIM." ON MY FIT IED, MY COUSIN IBRAHIM CLIMBED THE BRICK FENCE. OUR NEIGHBORS PUT IT THERE, WHEN THE BOYS FROM DOWN THE STREET CLIMBED THE FENCE AND TO THEIR DAUGHTER'S BEDROOMS. THIS BORDER SATIATES A GRAVING FOR SOMETHING SWEET. A DEFLOWERING, A TASTE OF GIRL. A FRUIT. IT'S HIS FIFTH, IED, IBRAHIM WANTS A DATE. HE STUMBLES UP ALABASTER BRICKS A BLOCK AWAY FROM HARVEST. IBRAHIM AND HIS CARDIMUM BELLY AND WITH HELIUM WASPS, I WATCH HIM FLY, CLUTCH AT SUN, SKIP, SLIP, SLITHER, HIS SHOE IS OFF. IBRAHIM IS MISSED. IBRAHIM GETS THE BARBED WIRE FOR BOYS WITH CURIOUS BOYS. IBRAHIM IS BARBED WIRE. HIS IT'S CLOTHES AND THE SHOUTS FOR HIS LEFT SHOE. IBRAHIM -- IBRAHIM, FORGET THE BLOOD. FORGET THE METAL IN HIS CRANIUM AND THE FALLEN DATES. FORGET IN THIS MOMENT THAT IBRAHIM IS STILL A BOY. IBRAHIM STILL WANTS HIS SHOES. IBRAHIM IS STILL. IBRAHIM IS CHRISTOPHER WALKEN, I AM WINNING. GENTLY LIFTING HIS HEAD INTO PINK CLOTH, HALTING RASPBERRY LEAKS, WAITING FOR THE SUN TO DROP A CANDIED FLEDGLING. THANK YOU. [ APPLAUSE ]
00:08:08.094: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. WE NOW HAVE COMMUNICATION FROM THE POLICE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION.
00:08:20.006: >> GOOD EVENING. MY NAME IS MASHAD EVANS. I SERVE AS THE SENIOR PASTOR HERE IN ANN ARBOR, WHICH FOR 163 YEARS HAS SERVED THIS COMMUNITY IN SOME AWESOME WAYS AND I'M PRIVILEGED TO SERVE AS ITS LEADER. I ALSO SERVE ON THE INDEPENDENT POLICE -- THE INDEPENDENT COMMUNITY POLICE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION, AND I BRING THIS UPDATE AT THIS TIME. THE INDEPENDENT COMMITTEE POLICE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION CYSTS TO FOSTER A MUTUALLY RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE ANN ARBOR POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE COMMUNITY AND WE TAKE THIS CHARGE VERY SERIOUSLY. WE ARE DISHEARTENED AND DISAPPOINTED BY THE OVERALL HANDLING OF THE PLACEMENT OF THE POLICE CHIEF COX ON ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE. ALL ASPECTS OF IT HAS CAUSED CONSIDERABLE UPHEAVAL AND CONCERN TO PEOPLE WORKING AND LIVING IN THIS WONDERFUL CITY. OUR CITY IS BIGGER THAN ANY SINGLE PERSON, ANY SINGLE JOB, ANY SINGLE BODY. ANN ARBOR IS NOT DEFINED BY THE MAYOR, THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR, THE POLICE CHIEF, CITY COUNCILMEMBERS OR EVEN THIS COMMISSION. ALL OF US SHARE THE OBLIGATION TO SERVE THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE PUBLIC, AND WITH THAT COMES A RESPONSIBILITY TO BE TRANSPARENT AND ACCOUNTABLE IN EXECUTING THAT SERVICE. IT IS CLEAR THAT THE SERIES OF EVENTS HAVE HARMED MANY PEOPLE AT SOME LEVEL AND IN SOME WAY. SO AS WE MOVE FORWARD, WE CALL UPON ALL PARTIES, INCLUDING OURSELVES AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS, TO TAKE THOUGHTFUL AND CONSTRUCTIVE ACTIONS TO REPAIR THE HARM THAT HAS BEEN DONE BY THESE EVENTS. ALTHOUGH AT ITS CORE THIS MAY BE LARGELY A HUMAN RESOURCE PROBLEM AND WE ARE NOT HUMAN RESOURCE PROFESSIONALS, WE BECAME INVOLVED WHEN THE CITY DIRECTED DIRECTORS TO ASK THE CHIEF ABOUT US. NO INVESTIGATOR SPOKE TO US AND WE WERE NOT PERMITTED TO SPEAK TO T THEM ALTHOUGH WE ARE REFERENCED IN THE FINAL INVESTIGATIVE REPORT. SHOULD WE HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE REVIEW OF THE ALLEGED MISCONDUCT WITH THE DEPARTMENT? SHOULD WE HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE OVERVIEW OF PROCEDURES USED TO INVESTIGATE THESE ACTIONS? SHOULD WE HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN ANY ACTION TAKEN AS A RESULT OF THE OUTCOMES OF THAT INVESTIGATION? THESE QUESTIONS REMAIN UNANSWERED, EVEN THOUGH THE ORDINANCE, WHICH WAS PASSED BY THIS COUNCIL INDICATED THAT WE HAVE THAT LEGITIMATE ROLE. MORE IMPORTANTLY, HOWEVER, WE ARE INVESTED IN THESE EVENTS BECAUSE THE PUBLIC HAS COME TO US, SEEKING ANSWERS AND INFORMATION THAT THEY COULD NOT FIND ELSEWHERE. ICPOC BECAME THE NECESSARY PUBLIC FORUM WHERE PEOPLE COULD EXPRESS THEIR GRAVE CONCERNS ABOUT A PROCESS THAT IS PERCEIVED AS RACIALIZED. WE HAVE BEEN A LANDING POINT FOR PEOPLE WITH SERIOUS MISGIVINGS ABOUT THE REPEATED LACK OF TRANSPARENCY ON THE PART OF CITY GOVERNMENT. THE TRAGEDY IS THAT MANY OF THESE EVENTS THAT OSTENSIBLY WARRANTED AN INVESTIGATION COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED AND REMEDIED BY AN EFFECTUAL H.R. DEPARTMENT. HOWEVER, OUR CITY GOVERNMENT AND OUR COMMUNITY WERE ALREADY REELING FROM THE DEFICIENCIES WITHIN THE H.R. DEPARTMENT DUE TO THE IMPACT OF ROBIN WILKERSON'S TOXIC LEADERSHIP AND HER OVERDUE FIRING. THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR ALLOWED HER TO UP ARE THE H.R. DEPARTMENT WITH A TONE OF PERSONAL BIGOTRY AND RACIAL INTOLERANCE THAT DROVE AWAY MANY TALENTED EMPLOYEES. THAT SHE WAS ALLOWED TO DO SO UNCHECKED DESPITE PEOPLE RAISING CONCERNS ABOUT HER BEHAVIOR FOR YEARS CAUSED HARM. THE FAILURE TO HIRE A QUALIFIED AND SKILLED REPLACEMENT HAS ONLY CAUSED ADDITIONAL HARM. HAD THERE BEEN A HIGHLY FUNCTIONAL H.R. DEPARTMENT, EMPLOYEE WITH CONCERNS COULD HAVE GONE THERE CONFIDENTIALLY TO SEEK SUPPORT AND ADVICE. HAD THERE BEEN A HIGHLY FUNCTIONING H.R. DEPARTMENT, THERE COULD HAVE BEEN ORIENTED TO THE CHIEF ABOUT THE ANN ARBOR CULTURE TO SUPPORT HIS LEADERSHIP TRANSITION. HAD THERE BEEN A HIGHLY FUNCTIONING INDEPENDENT H.R. DEPARTMENT, THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO WEIGH IN ON THE POTENTIAL HARM CAUSED BY THE WAY THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR CHOSE TO HANDLE THIS VERY MATTER. A CITY ADMINISTRATOR WHO HAS BASKBEEN TERMINATED BY THIS COU. THE ABSENCE OF THESE VITAL FUNCTIONS UNDERMINED OPPORTUNITY TO ACHIEVE FAIR AND EQUITABLE OUTCOMES AND THROUGHOUT THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR TO RISE UP UNCHECKED. THE WAY EVENTS ARE HANDLED CAN OFTEN AS PROBLEMATIC AS THE EVENTS THEMSELVES. OUR POSITION AS A COMMISSION IS TO LOOK FORWARD, TO LOOK FORWARD BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT IS MOST IMPORTANT. THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN AND TO HEAL FROM THE WOUNDS WITHIN THE SITUATION, CITY ADMINISTRATION, AND THE CITY COUNCIL AND MOST SIGNIFICANTLY, BETWEEN ALL OF THESE ENTITIES AND THE COMMUNITY. IT WILL REQUIRE COURAGE TO BE OPEN AND VULNERABLE, TO FACE DIFFICULT TRUTHS AND NOT JUST LEARN FROM THEM, BUT TO MAYBE TRANSFORMATIVE SHIFTS, TOWARD OUR SHARED GOALS OF AN INCLUSIVE, HEALTHY AND STRONG COMMUNITY. WE NEED YOU TO BE BRAVE, AS WE NEED TO BE BRAVE OURSELVES TO SET ASIDE MILL AGENDAS AND GET TO WORK TO REMEDY THE HARMS THAT HAVE BEEN CAUSED HERE. MICHAEL COX WAS CHOSEN TO LEAD OUR POLICE DEPARTMENT, BECAUSE HIS POLICING EXPERIENCES AND VALUES ALIGNED WITH OUR GOALS A COMMUNITY. THEREFORE, WE URGE ALL PARTIES TO COLLABORATE TO SUPPORT THE CHIEF, SUCH THAT OUR COMMUNITY CAN ACHIEVE EQUITABLE POLICING IN ANN ARBOR WITH THE HEALTHIEST AND HIGHEST FUNCTIONING POLICE DEPARTMENT. WE SUPPORT THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THOSE WHO SERVE, BUT AS MEMBERS OF THIS COMMUNITY, WE ALSO CALL ALL OF US INTO ACCOUNT. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE BE ABLE TO WORK THROUGH OUR DIFFERENCESS AS A CITY EVEN WHEN WE DO NOT AGREE. COMMUNITY TRUST ALREADY WEAK IN MANY AREAS HAS CLEARLY BEEN DAMAGED BY THIS PROCESS. COMMUNITY TRUST CAN AND MUST BE BUILT ON A FOUNDATION CREATED WITH OPEN AND TRANSPARENT DIALOGUE. WE NEED TO UNITE IN OUR ABILITY TO WORK THROUGH THOSE DIFFERENCES TOGETHER, TO FIND A WAY FORWARD. TRUST MUST BE REGAINED THROUGH TRUTH, TRANSPARENCY, AND ACCOUNTABILITY. WHY? BECAUSE THIS GREAT CITY OF ANN ARBOR DESERVES NOTHING LESS. [ APPLAUSE ]
00:15:14.520: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
00:15:22.962: >> Mayor Taylor: WE NOW COME TO PUBLIC COMMENT RESERVE TIME. PUBLIC COMMENT RESERVE TIME IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO SPEAK TO COUNCIL AND THE COMMUNITY ABOUT MATTERS OF MUNICIPAL INTEREST TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT RESERVE TIME, ONE NEED NOT -- ONE NEEDS TO HAVE SIGNED UP IN ADVANCE BY CONTACTING OUR CITY CLERK. SPEAKERS HAVE THREE MINUTES IN WHICH TO SPEAK. PLEASE PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE TIME CLOCK. WE MAY ONLY HAVE ONE PERSON SPEAKING AT A TIME. AND FINALLY IF YOU REQUIRE ASSISTANCE IN SPEAKING BEFORE COUNCIL TODAY, WE WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO PROVIDE IT TO YOU. OUR FIRST SPEAKER IS LORI SAGINAW.
00:15:59.832: >> GOOD EVENING. I'M NOT A POET AND I'M NOT A PASTOR. BUT WHEN I COCHAIRED THE POLICE OVERSIGHT TASK FORCE A FEW YEARS BACK, IT WAS  MY FIRST CHANCE TO WORK WITH THE CITY AND MY EYES WERE OPENED TO THE TREMENDOUS RESPONSIBILITIES OF THOSE WHO ARE ELECTED TO SERVE. AS THE UNBELIEVABLE COMPLEXITIES OF GOVERNANCE. I ALSO GOT AN ADDITIONAL PERSPECTIVE ON MY PROGRESSIVE LIBERAL COMMUNITY, BECAUSE I CAME FACE-TO-FACE WITH THE TWO ANN ARBORS. THE INCLUSIVE ONE, WHICH INCLUDES MY ZIP CODE, WHERE I HAVE LIVED FOR 46 YEARS; AND THE OTHER ANN ARBOR. COULD THE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION BE A STEP TO BRINGING THOSE TWO ANN ARBORS TOGETHER? COULD WE EVER TRULY LIVE INCLUSIVELY AS ONE COMMUNITY? THAT WAS MY HOPE. EVEN THOUGH I EXPERIENCED THAT IT WOULD NOT COME EASILY, BECAUSE OF HOW POWER AND PRIVILEGE HOLD ON TO POWER AND PRIVILEGE. AND HOW PUSHBACK SPRINGS UP TO RESIST WHO AND WHAT IS DIFFERENT AND HOW CHANGE CAN CAUSE FEAR AND BRING FORTH HARSH CRITICISM AND RESENTMENT. ALL OF THESE FORCES WORK TOGETHER TO HOLD TIGHT TO THE THINGS THAT ARE THE WAY THEY ARE, AND TO PRESERVE THE SAT TSTATUSQUO. THE FORMATION OF THE INDEPENDENT COMMUNITY POLICE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION, COMBINED WITH THE HIRING OF CHIEF COX FELT LIKE EXTRAORDINARY STEPS TOWARDS A FUTURE FOR MY CITY. AND I IMAGINED THAT A JUSTINE ANN ARBOR TO BOSTON WOULD BE JUST AS DIFFICULT AS A JUSTINE BOSTON TO ANN ARBOR. THEN LESS THAN A YEAR INTO HIS ARRIVAL, WE ARE CONFRONTED WITH GROSS UNCERTAINTY, UPHEAVAL AND SPECULATION AROUND CHIEF COX'S FORCED LEAVE AND THE INVESTIGATION OF HIM. HOW BAD WERE HIS ACTIONS TO WARRANT SUCH TREATMENT AND PUBLIC SHAMING? HOW MUCH QUESTIONING OF THE CITY'S TRUE COMMITMENT TO HIM HAS ARISEN? TODAY, THE CHIEF CAME BACK TO WORK. WHAT A DAY IT MUST HAVE BEEN FOR HIM. I WANT ACCOUNTABILITY AND I AM CONFIDENT THAT THE CHIEF DOES TOO. THERE IS STILL MUCH SURROUNDING THE SITUATION TO BE REVIEWED AND RESOLVED BUT FOR THE SAKE OF EVERYONE IMPACTED, AND BY THAT, I MEAN THE CHIEF AND HIS FAMILY, ALL THE INDIVIDUALS OF THE POLICE DEPARTMENT, CITY COUNCIL, CITY ADMINISTRATION, THE INDEPENDENT COMMUNITY POLICE COMMISSION, AND EVERYONE IN THIS COMMUNITY, LET'S LOOK FORWARD. WHATEVER THE CHIEF'S SHORTCOMINGS OR MISSTEPS ARE, LET -- THANK YOU.
00:19:05.651: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS PETER HOUK. [ APPLAUSE ]
00:19:15.094: >> HELLO, COUNCILMEMBERS. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TONIGHT. WELCOME MR. CRAWFORD. ABOUT THE RESOLUTION NAMING AN INTERIM CITY ADMINISTRATOR IT SAYS -- IT ACKNOWLEDGES THAT MANY CRAWFORD MAY REQUEST ADDITIONAL ARE HIRING FUNDING. I WOULD LIKE TO SAY, PLEASE GIVE HIM WHAT HE NEEDS TO BE SUCCESSFUL. BUT I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THIS IS JUST THE FIRST ADDITIONAL COST THAT WE HAVE SEEN SO FAR RELATED TO THE TERMINATION OF MR. LAZARUS. THERE ARE DIFFERENT ESTIMATES CIRCULATING ABOUT THE INITIAL COST TO THE CITY OF HIS TERMINATION, BUT THE LOW ESTIMATE IS NOW $225,000 AND COUNTING. THE NEXT INCREMENTAL COST I ASSUME WILL BE A CONTRACT TO HIRE A SEARCH FIRM OR A NEW ADMINISTRATOR. SO I MADE A LIST OF PROJECTS THAT I WANT TO APPLY $225,000 TO. FIRSTLY, REPLACE THE BIKE LANE ON SCIO CHURCH NEAR MAPLE. IT HAS DISAPPEARED. IT HAS LITERALLY CRUMBLED AWAY. FIX THE SIDEWALK ON SCIO CHURCH SO I DON'T HAVE TO REPLACE ANOTHER WHEEL ON MRS. HOUK'S STATION WAGON AND LASTLY, BUILD A BASIN SO MY NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE DOES NOT FLOOD. YOU HAVE SEEN HER STANDING HERE WITH PICTURES OF HER HOUSE ENTIRELY SURROUNDED WITH WATER. THIS IS NOT A CITY WITH AN EXTRA $225,000 TO SPEND AND YET THE COUNCIL MAJORITY SQUANDERED THAT AWAY NEXT MONTH. TO ALL WHO VOTED IN FAVOR OF THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR'S TERMINATION. PERHAPS THIS AMOUNT SEEMS SMALL TO YOU WHEN COMPARED WITH THE OVERALL CITY BUDGET, BUT IT'S STILL ALMOST A QUARTER OF A MILLION DOLLARS, AND PERHAPS THAT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A LOT TO YOU, BUT IT DOES TO ME. AND YOU DECIDED TO SPEND THAT MONEY WITHOUT ASKING THE OPINIONS OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS NOR EVEN GIVING THEM A FAIR OPPORTUNITY TO VOICE THEIR OPINIONS. IT WAS ADDED TO THE AGENDA THE DAY OF THE MEETING. AND YOU VOTED FOR -- IN FAVOR OF A CONTRACT THAT IS DESIGNED TO PREVENT YOU AND MR. LAZARUS FROM DISCUSSING THE SITUATION PUBLICLY. THIS IS NOT THE BEHAVIOR OF PEOPLE WHO VALUE TRANSPARENCY, PUBLIC INPUT AND FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY. THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF INTEREST LATELY ABOUT TRANSPARENCY REGARDING STAFF EMAILS AND MEETING SCHEDULES, FROM SOME OF THE SAME MEMBERS OF COUNCIL WHO VOTED TO TERMINATE MR. LAZARUS. AND THERE'S ALSO BEEN A LOT OF THE SAME MEMBER OF COUNCIL ABOUT LISTENING TO VOTERS AND RESPONSIBLE SPENDING REGARDING THE MENTAL HEALTH MILLAGE BUT YOU DID NOT DEMONSTRATE A COMMITMENT TO TRANSPARENCY, NOR TO LISTENING TO VOTERS, NOR TO RESPONSIBLE SPENDING IN YOUR TERMINATION OF MR. LAZARUS. SOME OF THEM ARE MORE IMPORTANT AT SOMETIMES THAN OTHERS. I EXPECT BETTER FROM CITY COUNSEL SIX THANK YOU.
00:22:10.369: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER MOZHGAN SAVABIESFAHANI.
00:22:22.381: >> WE HAVE MAJORS THINGS NO DISCUSS. I HAVE BEEN HERE AND I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN HERE TALKING ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS AND ALSO THE SITUATION WITH DIRTY WATER IN ANN ARBOR. DIOXANE AND PFAS CONTAMINATION. THEY ARE VOTING ON A RESOLUTION TO INCLUDE EPA IN CLEANING UP THE GELMAN DIOXANE CONTAMINATION. I'M HERE TO REMIND YOU THAT IN JANUARY, MR. TANAKA, THE HEAD OF THE SUPERFUND OFFICE OF THE EPA, SHE WAS HERE AND TOLD EVERY SINGLE ONE OF OUR CITY COUNCILMEMBERS AND THE MAYOR THAT THE EPA COULD TAKE DECADES BEFORE THEY DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT THEY WILL TAKE ON GELMAN DIOXANE CONTAMINATION FOR CLEANUP. DECADES BEFORE THEY EVEN DECIDE. AFTER THAT, IT COULD TAKE DECADES MORE TO -- IF THEY DECIDE, THEY WILL DO IT TO CLEAN IT UP. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU, IF YOU THINK THAT EPA INVOLVEMENT IS THE WAY TO GO, TO CLEAN OUR WATERS, THAT'S JUST WISHFUL THINKING. WHY DON'T YOU PUT A MILLAGE TO THE PUBLIC, ASK THEM WHETHER OR NOT THEY WILL PAY TO CLEAN UP THIS TOXIC PLUME, WHICH WE SIT AND DRINK FROM. THIS IS -- THIS IS JUST UNBELIEVABLE TO ME. WHEN I FIRST CAME TO ANN ARBOR TO STUDY ENVIRONMENT, I THOUGHT I WAS COMING TO A CITY WHERE PEOPLE CARED ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT WHERE THEY WANTED TO DDO THE RIGHT THING BY THE ENVIRONMENT. MORE I LIVE HERE, I REALIZE THAT IS NOT THE CASE. CITY COUNCIL AFTER CITY COUNCIL HAVE FAILED TO CLEAN OUR WATERS AND NOW THEY ARE TELLING US THEY WILL WAIT ANOTHER 30 YEARS FOR THE EPA TO TELL THEM WHETHER OR NOT THEY WILL DO IT THIS IS HORRIFIC. AND ALL OF THIS AT THE SAME TIME WHERE TRIBAR IS SPEWING PFAS INTO OUR ENVIRONMENT. YOU HAVE NO PLANS OF ENVIRONMENTAL CLEANUP, AND THE COMPANY IS DOING ITS THING WITHOUT ANY DISTRACTION. THIS TELLS ME THAT YOU DO NOT -- YOU DO NOT RESPECT THE ENVIRONMENT, AND YOU ARE NOT ACTING TO CLEAN IT UP PROMPTLY. IT'S TAKING YOU 35 YEARS FOR GELMAN AND IT'S STILL THERE. AND YOU STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU WANT AND YOU ARE STILL NOT PLANNING FOR ACTUAL THING THAT WOULD CLEAN IT UP. IT GETS ME EXTREMELY ANGRY BECAUSE YOU KEEP TALKING ABOUT STOPPING GLOBAL WARMING. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO STOP GLOBAL WARMING OR TAKE ACTION AGAINST IT IF YOU CAN'T EVEN CLEAN UP THIS LITTLE  PUDDLE OF WATER WHICH YOU HAVE BEEN MESSING WITH FOR 35 YEARS. I WANT TO KNOW HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT? CLEAN IT UP! IT'S BEEN LONG ENOUGH! IT'S TIME TO CLEAN IT UP! [ APPLAUSE ]
00:25:17.990: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS BLAINE COLEMAN. I HOPE YOU HEARD HER LOUD AND CLEAR. IT'S BEYOND ME ALSO HOW -- HOW ON EARTH YOU COULD FAIL TO JUST GET A MILLAGE AND CLEAN UP THIS GELMAN DIOXANE PLUME RIGHT THIS MINUTE. I MEAN, WHY DON'T YOU JUST DO IT? AND THE ALTERNATIVE THAT YOU ARE PROPOSING, HEY, I DON'T WANT TO STAND IN THE WAY, IF YOU WANT TO ASK EPA TO HELP YOU OUT, GOOD LUCK, BUT THE EPA HAS TOLD YOU IT COULD BE 30 YEARS BEFORE THEY EVEN FINISH A FEASIBILITY STUDY. AND HE UNDERSTAND THEY WOULD HAND OVER THE FEASIBILITY STUDY TO THE POLLUTER TO DO. SO, YOU KNOW, THAT'S NOT A PRESCRIPTION FOR A QUICK -- I MEAN, 30 YEARS FROM NOW, I MIGHT BE TOO OLD TO ENJOY THIS BEGINNING INAUGURATION CLEANUP THAT WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO. SO -- SO I THINK YOU SHOULD JUST PUT THE SHOVEL IN THE GROUND. PUT IT UP NOW AND PUT THE MILLAGE UP FOR VOTE. IF THERE'S ANYONE WHO WANTS TO VOTE DIOXANE, THEY WILL VOTE AGAINST THE MILLAGE FINE. THEY WILL COUGH UP THE MONEY, CLEAN IT UP AND GO AFTER GELMAN FOR EVERYTHING IT COSTS. DOESN'T THAT MAKE MORE SENSE THAN THE DOG AND PONY SHOW OF RUNNING BACK AND FORTH TO ENDLESS MEETINGS THAT DON'T PUT A SHOVEL IN THE GROUND AND DON'T CLEAN UP THE WATER. IF YOU WANT A LITTLE FLYER, IT SAYS URGENT CLEANUP OF OUR WATER AN A LITTLE SHOVEL, JUST TO REMIND YOU, PUT YOUR SHOVEL IN THE WATER AND CLEAN UP THE DIOXANE CONTAMINATION. THAT'S WHAT CITY GOVERNMENTS DO, RIGHT? THERE ARE THINGS YOU WILL SEE ON HER PLATFORM AND SHE'S SERIOUS ABOUT IT, UNLIKE -- UNLIKE HER OPPONENT. WHEN SHE SAYS AFFORDABLE HOUSING, SHE DOESN'T MEAN IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WHAT SHE MEANS IS BUILD THE DAM INTHING. GET RID OF IT. GET RID OF THE FAIR CLOTH AMENDMENT. GET RID OF IT, TELL CONGRESS TO GET RID OF IT, AND BUILD THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. GET UNCLE SAM TO COUGH UP THE MONEY. IF THEY WON'T DO, IT GET THE STATE TO COUGH IT UP. IF THEY WON'T DO IT, COUGH IT UP YOURSELF. BUILD PUBLIC HOUSING LIKE SO MANY GREAT CITIES HAVE. VIENNA, AUSTRIA, MOST OF THE PEOPLE LIVE IN PUBLIC HOUSING. SHE LOVE IT. THEY SPEND $350 A MONTH, FOR A NICE APARTMENT. YOU CAN BUILD PUBLIC HOUSING INSTEAD OF JUST TALKING ABOUT IT. MASS TRANSPORTATION, TRIPLE IT, QUADRUPLE IT SO PEOPLE ARE NOT SHACKLED TO A CAR, SO PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO GO OUT AND SPEND $20,000 THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO BUY A CAR. TRIPLE, QUADRUPLE MASS TRANSPORTATION NOW. $115 MINIMUM WAGE, PUSH FOR IT. PUSH FOR IT. SEATTLE DID I IT AND KNOCK DOWN THE OBSTACLES IN THE WAY. THERE ARE OBSTACLES. AND END MILITARY AID TO ISRAEL. PASS THE RESOLUTION. PASS IT. SEE THIS RESOLUTION? PASS IT.
00:28:35.721: >> Mayor Taylor: OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS ELIZABETH COLLINS.
00:28:40.793: >> HI, CITY COUNCIL, FRIENDS, NEIGHBORS, MAYOR TAYLOR. MY NAME IS BETH COLLINS. I LIVE IN WARD 5. TWO WEEKS AGO, I STOOD HER AND SPOKE ABOUT SOMETHING WONDERFUL THAT WE WERE DOING IN OUR CITY WITH THE ENVIRONMENT. TRYING TO EDUCATE AND ELIMINATE TURF GRASSES AND PESTICIDES. TODAY, I'M TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING SO DISGUSTING AND SAD WITH OUR ENVIRONMENT, WE HAVE DIOXANE IN OUR DRINKING WATER AGAIN LAST MONTH. THIS HAPPENED LAST YEAR TWICE. I KNOW IT'S TRACE AMOUNTS BUT TRACE AMOUNTS ARE UNACCEPTAGE. WE SHOULDN'T HAVE ANY DIOXANE IN OUR DRINKING WATER. WE KNOW WHERE IT'S COMING FROM. WE CAN DENY THAT IT'S GELMAN, BUT IT'S GELMAN! THERE'S NO OTHER WAY THAT IT'S ANY OTHER DIOXANE. WE HAVE CONTINUED TO LET THIS POLLUTER, DISCHARGE ITS TREATED WATER INTO HONEY CREEK, WHICH FLOWS INTO THE HURON RIVER AT 22 PARTS PER BILLION, THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE. THE POLLUTER KNOWS HOW TO CLEAN UP TO 0 0 PARTS PER BILLION. THEY COULD BE CLEANING IT UP TO THAT AND THEN DISCHARGING IT SOMEWHERE. THIS IS TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE. I'M SO SORRY YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS. PEOPLE HAVE SAT HERE FOR 35 YEARS, AT THE SAME TABLE THAT YOU ARE SITTING AT, TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A WAY, AND NOTHING HAS CHANGED. THE EPA 30 YEARS TO A TOTAL CLEANUP AND IT'S NOT JUST A START. THEY SAID 30 YEARS TO A TOTAL CLEANUP OF DRINKING WATER STANDARD, THAT'S BETTER THAN 30 MORE YEARS OF THIS. I MEAN, I'M AT WIT'S END. MAYBE A MILLAGE, MAYBE A WHATEVER -- WHATEVER WE NEED TO DO. LET'S TIE INTO DETROIT. MAYBE WE SHOULD START DOING THAT NOW, GETTING A NEW DRINKING WATER SOURCE BECAUSE THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. I MAKE FORMULA FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTER WITH DRINKING WATER. I DON'T WANT ANY PARTS PER BILLION. .038 IS NOT GOOD! I'M SORRY. AND OUR WATER TREATMENT PLANT IS. WONDERFUL. I'M NOT SLAMMING THEM IN ANY WAY, SHAPE OR FORM. THEY ARE DOING THEIR JOB. THIS IS THE POLLUTER. THIS IS GELMAN DAN AHER. I HOPE THAT YOU WILL NOT CONTINUE TO LET THEM MANIPULATE YOU. THEY ARE MANIPULATING YOU THROUGH THEIR ATTORNEYS. I'M SORRY. I HOPE THE SCIO TRUSTEES MIGHT GET WORD THAT THIS IS IN OUR WATER. I HOPE EVERYONE KNOWS IT'S IN OUR WATER, ALL THE WASHTENAW COUNTY COMMISSIONERS, COUNCIL, YES, EVERYONE NEEDS TO TAKE SOME MEASURES. PLEASE DO NOT KEEP CONTINUING TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE POLLUTER. AND OUR SURFACE WATERS. THIS IS -- IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE IN THE SURFACE WATERS. IT'S ALLOWED TO BE UNDERNEATH US. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. I'M SORRY. I'M UPSET TOO. SO THANK YOU, EVERYBODY. HAVE A GOOD -- [ APPLAUSE ]
00:31:27.893: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS GEOFFREY HENNY. MR. HENNY? GEOFFREY HENNY? OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS ABU IBRAHIM.
00:32:02.861: >> MY NAME IS ABU IBRAHIM. I ADDRESSED COUNCIL A COUPLE OF TIMES BEFORE. IT'S GOING TO MAKE A POINT OR A SPEECH, BUT I DIDN'T REALLY SEE THE AGENDA UNTIL RIGHT NOW. AND IT SEEMS LIKE YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO EXPLAIN TO THE CITY AT LEAST SOMEWHAT WHY YOU PUT THE CHIEF OF POLICE ON LEAVE. IS THAT ON YOUR AGENDA? IS THAT IN THE AGENDA?
00:32:31.823: >> Mayor Taylor: THERE'S A RESOLUTION.
00:32:33.425: >> IT'S A RESOLUTION. SO YOU GUYS ARE TALKING ABOUT IT. I MET WITH THE MAYOR LAST WEEK, ON FRIDAY, AND I ASKED HIM WHY THE CHIEF OF POLICE WAS PUT ON LEAVE BY THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR, WHY HE WAS FIRED, WHICH HE COULDN'T TELL ME THE SECOND DUE TO THEIR AGREEMENT, BUT WHAT YOU TOLD ME, PA MAYOR TAYLOR DOESN'T MAKE SENSE AND I WANTED YOU TO TELL THE PEOPLE AND SEE IF IT MAKES SENSE TO THEM, THAT THE CHIEF OF POLICE WOULD BE PUT ON LEAVE BECAUSE OF A LOVE AFFAIR OR A LOVE QUARREL BETWEEN TWO PARKING AGENTS. IT SE SEEMS ODD TO ME. THE TRUTH IS, IN THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR, THERE'S A LOT OF BACKROOM -- RACIST BACKROOM POLITICS GOING ON TO PREVENT JUSTICE FROM BEING UPHELD, TO PREVENT THE CITY FROM BEING PROSECUTED FOR ITS CRIMES AND ITS MISCONDUCT. I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET THE ICPOC A REDACTED VIDEO OF AN ILLEGAL ARREST THAT I HAVE BEEN ASKING FOR SEVEN MONTHS. MY COMPLAINT THAT WAS ACCOMPANYING -- ACCOMPANIED THE VIDEO HAS GONE TO THE POLICE DEPARTMENT, BEEN INVESTIGATED, AND THESE OFFICERS HAVE BEEN EXONERATED ALREADY. NOW, THE NEXT STEP IS FOR THE COMPLAINT AND THE VIDEO TO BE SENT TO THE ICPOC THIS HAS BEEN STAGGERING FOR THE LAST FIVE MONTHS. A WEEK BEFORE I WAS SUPPOSED TO MEET WITH THE CHIEF OF POLICE ABOUT THIS, HE WAS THE ONLY PERSON IN POLICE DEPARTMENT WHO DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT IT. HE'S ONLY BEEN HERE FOR SIX MONTHS AND I FILED THE COMPLAINT SEVEN MONTHS AGO. HE GETS PUT ON LEAVE FOUR DAYS LATER. AFTER THAT, THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR IS FIRED. I WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON. EVERYONE WANTS TO KNOW WHAT IS REALLYOING ON. AND THE STORY THAT YOU GUYS ARE GIVING US, YOU KNOW IT'S BULLSHIT AND WE KNOW IT'S BULLSHIT. SHE KNOWS IT'S BULLSHIT. DON'T YOU, MS. NELSON? THAT'S ALL. THANK YOU.
00:34:49.995: >> Mayor Taylor: OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS HENRY HERSKOVITZ.
00:35:06.044: >> GOOD EVENING. I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS SOME COMMENTS MADE HERE DURING COMMUNICATIONS FROM COUNCIL ON JANUARY 21. AT THAT MEETING, COUNCILMAN HAYNER ASKED, CAN'T YOU GUYS SIT DOWN AND HAVE SOME SORT OF PRIVATE CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS? I THINK THAT'S A TERRIFIC SUGGESTION, AND ONE I HAVE TRIED TO ENGENDER MORE THAN ONCE. IN 2016, I ASKED THEN COUNCILWOMAN SABER BR BRIERE SAI WILL REACH OUT TO ZACH AND JULIE AND SAY YOU WOULD BE HAPPY TO TALK WITH THEM TO DISCUSS THEIR FEELINGS. SABER NEVER GA INDICATED THE RESULTS OF HER OUTREACH AND THE MEETING NEVER OCCURRED. MANY PEOPLE REMEMBER THE SHOOTING AT A PITTSBURGH SYNAGOGUE IN 2018. IN RESPONSE, I HAND DELIVERED A LETTER TO THE OFFICES OF BETH ISRAEL RABBI KANE, WHICH READ IN PART, OUT OF RESPECT FOR THE HUMAN LIVES LOST AND THOSE WHO MOURN THEM, WE HAVE ELECTED TO CANCEL OUR PROTEST THIS SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 3rd, 2018. I RECOGNIZE THIS SHORT NOTE IS AN AWKWARD GREETING TO YOU AND I'M OPEN TO INTRODUCING MYSELF AND DISCUSSING OUR VIGILS AT ANY TIME AND PLACE OF YOUR CHOOSING. AGAIN, NO RESPONSE. WHEN CONGREGANT VICTOR LIEBERMAN MISQUOTED ME IN THE WASHTENAW JEWISH NEWS, I IMMEDIATELY PENNED THIS CORRECTION TO THEN EDITOR SUSAN AYER. TO CLEAR UP ANY MISUNDERSTANDING BETWEEN OUR GROUP AND THE LOCAL JEWISH COMMUNITY, NEITHER I NOR ANYONE IN OUR GROUP, BELIEVE THE JEWS DESERVED THE EXPERIENCE. HER REPLACEMENT CLAIRE KINDBERG REFUSES AS WELL. OUR GROUP IS THE TRANSPARENT ONE. WE ARE ALWAYS WILLING TO SIT DOWN TO WORK THINGS OUT. MAYOR TAYLOR FEELS THE VIGILS SHOULD END. SOME OF US AGREE. THE KEY IS IN BETH ISRAEL'S HAND. A 2009 LETTER PUBLISHED BY LATE SAUL METZ IN THE ANN ARBOR NEWS READ, WE WILL END THE VIGILS IF BETH ISRAEL COMMITS TO WORK FOR EATEQUAL RIGHTS AND THE WEST BAK AND EAST JERUSALEM AND FOR THE RIGHT OF PALESTINIANS TO RETURN TO THE HOMES FROM WHICH THEY WERE FORCIBLY REMOVED IN WHAT WAS TO BECOME ISRAEL. PEOPLE WHO WANT THE VIGILS TO END SHOULD APPROACH BETH ISRAEL AND ASK THEM TO DO THE RIGHT THING. THANK YOU.
00:37:54.279: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS CATHERINE WILKERSON.
00:38:00.151: >> GOOD EVENING. I'M DR. CATHERINE WILKERSON AND I COME TONIGHT TO ASK THAT RATHER THAN TAKING A STAND IN ALLEGIANCE TO THE U.S. FLAG, AND WHAT IT REPRESENTS, THAT YOU TAKE A STAND IN BOLD OPPOSITION INSTEAD. AS A PHYSICIAN AND MEMBER OF PHYSICIANS FOR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY, I ASK THAT ANN ARBOR JOIN THE CITY'S APPEAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL CAMPAIGN TO ABOLISH NUCLEAR WEAPONS. I CAN AS A COALITION OF ORGANIZATIONS AND 100 COUNTRIES PROMOTING ADHERENCE TO AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE UNITED NATIONS TREATY. FOUNDED FOR THE PREVENTION OF NUCLEAR WAR, E ICANN WAS AWARDED THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE. I'M A MEMBER OF THE PSR. THE TREATY PROHIBITS THE USE, PRODUCTION, AND STOCKPILING OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND LAYS THE FOUNDATION FOR THEIR ABOLITION. 122 FASHIONS VOTED TO SIGN TP & W. IT WILL BECOME INTERNATIONAL LAW WHEN 50 RATIFY. NONE OF THE NINE NUCLEAR ARMED NATIONS SUPPORTS TREATY. ALL ARE BUILDING NUCLEAR WEAPONS. THE UNITED STATES WHICH POSSESSES OVER 6,000 HAS SAID THEY NEVER INTEND TO JOIN THE TREATY. IT HAS FAILED TO FULFILL THE LEGALLY BINDING DISARMAMENT OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE NONPROLIFERATION TREATY. IT'S ENGAGED IN A DEADLY NUCLEAR ARMS RACE AT A COST OF OVER A TRILLION DOLLARS, MONEY THAT WE KNOW COULD BE BETTER SPENT IN THE CONTEXT OF A VIRAL EPIDEMIC AND PANDEMIC IN THE WORLD. EXPERTS CONCLUDE THAT THE RISK OF NUCLEAR WAR IS THE GRAVEST NOW SINCE WORLD WAR II. IN 2018, ICANN LAUNCHED THE CITY'S APPEAL. A COMMITMENT BY CITIES AND TOWNS TO SHOW SUPPORT FOR THE TREATY. HUNDREDS OF CITIES WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING BALTIMORE, HONOLULU, L.A., BERKELEY AND OTHERS HAVE PASSED RESOLUTIONS IN SUPPORT OF TP & W. THE TEXT OF THE APPEAL IS OUR CITY/TOWN IS DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE GRAVE THREAT THAT NUCLEAR WEAPONS POSE TO COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. WE FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT OUR RESIDENTS HAVE THE RIGHT TO LIVE IN A WORLD FREE FROM THIS THREAT. ANY USE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS WHETHER DELIBERATE OR ACDEMMIC, WOULD HAVE CONSEQUENCES TO EVERYONE IN THE ENVIRONMENT. WE SUPPORT THE TREATY ON THE PROHIBITION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND CALL ON OUR GOVERNMENTS TO JOIN IT. PLEASE JOIN THE HUNDREDS OF CITIES THAT HAVE ENDORSED ICANN CITY'S APPEAL. ADD ANN ARBOR TO THE LIST. NO INTO YOU CANS!
00:40:54.859: >> THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS ERIC MASSEY.
00:41:04.936: >> HI, GOOD EVENING, COUNCILMEMBERS. I STAND BEFORE YOU TODAY AS A RESIDENT OF ANN ARBOR AND AS A FATHER AND I'M HERE TO ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF THE DECRIMINALIZED NATURE ANN ARBOR MOVEMENT. I BELIEVE THAT THE CITIZENS OF ANN ARBOR AND THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE DESERVES TO HAVE ACCESS TO PLANT MEDICINES. THERE ARE STUDIES FROM JOHNS HOPKINS AND NYU THAT SHOW PLANT-BASED PSYCHODELICS ARE WELL TOLERATED AND DEMONSTRATE A HIGH SAFETY PROFILE. AS WELL AS REMARKABLE RESULTS FOR TREATMENT RESISTANT DEPRESSION AND ADDICTION. MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY ARE ALREADY SEEKING HELP FROM THESE MODALITIES. AND I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THEY SHOULD FEAR PROSECUTION FOR THESE TREATMENTS THAT ARE NOT ONLY EFFECTIVE BUT SAFE. I MYSELF HAVE GONE THROUGH A PROCESS OF HEALING FROM DEPRESSION, FROM ANXIETY, AND I'M STILL WORKING THROUGH MY OWN PAST TRAUMAS, AND MY ABILITY TO BE A -- AN ENGAGED MEMBER OF THE COMMUNITY, A PRESENT AND LOVING FATHER FOR MY SON, AND MY OWN BEST VERSION OF MYSELF HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY ENABLED BY HEALING THROUGH PLANT MEDICINES. SO THERE ARE OVER 100 INITIATIVES ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND VARIOUS COMMUNITIES AND THERE ARE INITIATIVES THAT HAVE PASSED IN DENVER AND OAKLAND AND SANTA CRUZ, THAT HAVE DECRIMINALIZED THESE PLANT MEDICINES, AND I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT THE COMMUNITY OF ANN ARBOR DESERVES ACCESS WITHOUT FEAR OF PROSECUTION. I THINK THAT THE WORLD IS IN DIRE NEED OF HEALING AND CURRENTLY, THE MEDICAL MODEL THAT'S AVAILABLE HAS FAILED SO MANY PEOPLE. THERE ARE RAMPANT EPIDEMICS OF ADDICTION AND, YOU KNOW, THE PROBLEMS THAT WE FACE AS A SOCIETY ARE UBIQUITOUS, THEY ARE PREVALENT. THEY ARE EVERYWHERE, AND WE NEED HELP. AND THERE ARE PLANT MEDICINES THAT HAVE BEEN USED FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS, THAT ARE SAFE, EFFECTIVE, AND THEY WORK. SO I -- PLEASE, I ADVOCATE YOU GUYS AND ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO THE RESEARCH. LOOK INTO THIS ISSUE, READ THE TESTIMONIES ONLINE. THERE ARE COUNTRIES LIKE PERU, WHERE IWUSCA IS CONSIDERED A NATIONAL HER ITAGE AND WE HAVE AMERICANS TRAVELING, VETERANS SEEKING HELP FROM PTSD, YOU KNOW? SO PLEASE DO THE RESEARCH AND LOOK INTO IT. THANK.
00:43:58.910: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS DEREK OLDMAN. DEREK OLDMAN. MAMR. OLDMAN? ARE.
00:44:30.207: >> I'M HERE TONIGHT TO REPRESENT THE CITIZENS OF ANN ARBOR IN ANTEATER TO DECRIMINALIZED NATURAL PSYCHEDELIC PLANT AND I FIRMLY BELIEVE IT'S HELPED ME BECOME A BETTER PERSON IN 2019, THERE WERE MASS SHOOTINGS THAN DAYS OF THE YEAR. OVER 15,000 PEOPLE LOST THEIR LIVES TO GUN VIOLENCE AND OVER 30,000 MORE WERE INJURED. THERE'S A LOT OF BAD NEWS THAT BURIES US EVERY DAY AND IT FEELS LIKE THERE'S NO HOPE FOR SOMEBODY THERE'S DOCTORS AND FARMERS AND ACTIVISTS IN ANN ARBOR WORKING TOGETHER TO FIND A SOLUTION. PSYCHEDELIC PLANTS AND FUNGI ARE PART OF THAT ANSWER. THE WAR ON DRUGS IS A FAILED EFFORT. MODERN PHARMACEUTICALS ARE NOT HELPING THE RAPID GROWTH OF MENTAL ILLNESS SWEEPING OUR NATION. YOU HAVE BIG NAMES LIKE JOHN HOB KINS OPENING UP -- HOPKIN OPENING ONE TREATMENT RESISTANCE DEPRESSION AND END OF LIFE ANXIETY. THE UNIVERSITY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA FOUND THAT PSYCHEDELIC DRUG USE IS ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCED PARTNERSHIP IN MEN. PEOPLE TAKEN PSYCHEDELIC WORE 27% LIKELY TO STOLEN SOMETHING AND 12% LESS LIKELY TO COMMIT ANY KIND OF ASSAULT. OUR VERY OWN UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN HOSTED A PSYCHEDELIC SYMPOSIUM LAST YEAR. THE DECRIMINALIZED MOVEMENT IS GAINING MOMENTUM AT APRIL EXPONENTIAL RATE. THE NEED FOR NEW SOLUTIONS IS PAST DUE. DENVER IS ON THE MAP FOR DECRIMINALIZING CANNABIS AND CILACIBINE FIRST. THERE ARE NOW OVER 100 CITIES ACROSS THE NATION THAT HAVE -- HAVE DECRIMINALIZED CAMPAIGN. THIS IS YOUR CHANCE TO TAKE BRONZE AND CLAIM A PODIUM SPOT ON THE NATIONAL CHARGE TO DECRIMINALIZE A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE SOLUTION TO SO MANY OF OUR NATION'S PROBLEMS. IF HE WITH WAIT, MORE PEOPLE WILL DIE. IF WE ACT, WE CAN SAVE LIVES, PUT ANN ARBOR ON THE MAP, ALLOW MORE RESEARCH, MORE INFORMATION AND MORE SOLUTIONS. IF YOU GOOGLE MUSHROOM CARTEL, THERE IS ONLY ONE RESULT OF A COMPANY PRICE FIXING CANNED MUSHROOMS. THAT'S IT! PEOPLE STANDING BEFORE YOU TONIGHT ARE NOT A CARTEL, BUT MOST OF US ARE CRIMINALS BECAUSE OF OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH THESE PLANTS AND FUNGI. I'M ASKING ALL OF YOU FOR OPPORTUNITY, FOR EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THIS ROOM T WALK AWAY FEELING LIKE A WINNER. YOU WILL BE CELEBRATED DECRIMINALIZE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO BECOME BETTER PEOPLE. THANK YOU.
00:47:06.397: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. [ APPLAUSE ] ARE THERE COMMUNICATIONS FROM COUNCIL? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
00:47:23.481: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I WOULD LIKE TO THANK EVERYONE FOR COMING OUT AND SPEAKING TONIGHT. I DON'T KNOW WHY A RANGE OF ISSUES. IT'S GREAT TO HAVE THE COMMUNITY THAT'S SO DIVERSE AND FULL OF DIFFERENT OPINIONS AND WE DEFINITELY GET TO -- I AT LEAST ENJOY IT. I JUST WANTED TO ADDRESS THE DECISION I WAS INVOLVED WITH AT OUR LAST COUNCIL MEETING, TO CHOOSE TO GO A DIFFERENT DIRECTION. THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF CRITICISM FROM THE COMMUNITY, AS TO MY DECISION ON THE VOTE WITH THE EMPLOYMENT OF OUR CITY ADMINISTRATOR -- OUR FORMER ONE. UNFORTUNATELY, BECAUSE OF THE AGREEMENTS PUT IN PLACE, OR FORTUNATELY, HOWEVER YOU WANT TO LOOK AT IT, VERY LITTLE TRANSPARENCY WAS AVAILABLE FOR THE COMMUNITY AND WE ARE BOUND TO AGREEMENTS AND FRANKLY, IT DOESN'T DO ANYBODY GOOD AT THIS INTPOINT. WE ARE ELECTED OFFICIALS WHO ARE GIVEN A VERY RESPONSIBILITY, AND I WOULD HOPE THAT OUR COMMUNITY WOULD UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE CAPABLE AND COMPETENT IN MAKING THOSE DECISIONS. THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF CRITICISMS THE FINANCIAL IMPACT. YOU KNOW, I WILL SAY THAT SOME OF THE STATEMENTS MADE BY MY COLLEAGUES WERE INCORRECT, THE FINANCIAL FIGURES WERE PUT OUT THERE WERE INCORRECT. AND I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT I WISH SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES WOULD HAVE WORKED WITH MYSELF AND OTHERS IN THE TIME IT TOOK THEM TO PUT OUT THE RESPONSE THEY PUT OUT AFTER THAT LAST COUNCIL MEETING. NONE OF IT WAS THERE. WHAT I WANT TO DO IS YOU WANT TO DO IS LOOK FORWARD AND WELCOME OUR NEW CITY ADMINISTRATOR FOR THE TIME BEING AND I WANT TO OFFER HIM MY SUPPORT, AND I WANT TO ASK HIM WHAT WE CAN DO TO MAKE OUR COMMUNITY BETTER. AND STRONGER. I BELIEVE AS COMMISSIONER EVANS SAID EARLIER AND I APPRECIATE ICPOC'S PRESENTATION TONIGHT, A VERY POWERFUL PRESENTATION YOU GAVE US, THAT WE ARE A COMMUNITY THAT'S BIGGER THAN ONE PERSON OR ONE POSITION OR ONE COMMISSIONER OR ONE COUNCIL. ALL THAT THE SKY IS NOT FALLING AND THIS ORGANIZATION IS STRONG AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO THE WORK WE ARE SET OUT TO DO. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH OTHERS SE OTHERS IN THE CIY GOVERNMENT TO ADVANCING THOSE GOALS AN I REALLY JUST WANTED TO LEAVE IT AT THAT, I GUESS. I REALLY WOULD LIKE FOR US TO MOVE FORWARD ON ALL FRONTS THAT WE NEED TO WORK ON. AND I WILL LEAVE IT THERE FOR NOW.
00:50:59.063: >> [ OFF MICROPHONE COMMENTS ]
00:51:02.099: >> Mayor Taylor: MA'AM? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
00:51:03.134: >> THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I .>> Councilmember Hayner:  I WOULD SAY, IT'S CHALLENGING TO BE UP HERE. ODD AS IT SOUNDS, THE BEST PART IS WHEN THE CHAMBERS ARE FULL. IT MEANS PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE CITY. THEY ARE INTERESTED IN THEIR GOVERNMENT OR THEIR CITY AND THEY CARE ABOUT THEIR CITY. THAT JUST MAKES IT -- YOU KNOW, IT MAKES IT WORTH WHILE, I GOT TO BE HONEST. I APPRECIATE SEEING A FULL CHAMBERS. I USUALLY GO DOWN A LIST OF THING HIS WANT TO SAY. I WILL START WITH MY USUAL, THE CARD MEETING, THE DIOXANE GROUP IS MEETING TOMORROW AT 6 P.M., AS ALWAYS, AND USUAL PLACE. AND WE HAVE PUT TOGETHER OUT THIS AT CARD, I ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO GO ONLINE AND CHECK IT OUT THE SRSW.ORG ALSO. WE HAVE PROBABLY ONE OF THE BEST KNOWN -- WE HAVE THE BEST INFORMATION ABOUT AS SAD AS THAT SOUNDS, WE HAVE THE BEST INFORMATION ABOUT DIOXANE TO THE WORST POLLUTION. I REALLY BELIEVE POLLUTERS SHOULD PAY. POLLUTERS SHOULD PAY.
00:52:12.470: >> WHEN?
00:52:12.736: >> Councilmember Hayner:  WE WILL HAVE A HEAD START. SO I HAD THE PLEASURE OF GOING TO AN EVENT LAST WEEK WITH ANTI-OGENIC PLANT FOLKS FOR THE PEOPLE WOULD DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS, I THINK IT'S PRETTY CLEAR WHAT IT IS, BUT IT'S -- YOU KNOW, IT'S PLANT MEDICINE. IT'S ANCIENT MEDICINES AND PART OF THE PLANET. AND IT'S PART OF THE BIOSPHERE THAT WE EXIST IN. I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT THING AND I LIKE WHAT THEY ARE DOING WITH IT AND I'M HAPPY TO BRING SOMETHING FORWARD AND WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT LEGALIZING PLANTS. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT BASICALLY MAINTAINING THE STATUS QUO WHERE THE POLICE DEPARTMENT HAS SO MANY OTHER CONCERNS, SO MANY THINGS TO LOOK OUT FOR. OPIOID CRISIS, HEROIN, HELPING PEOPLE. ALL KINDS OF THINGS THAT IT'S NOT ON THEIR RADAR. AND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO -- WHAT THESE RESOLUTIONS THAT I HAVE SEEN FROM THE OTHER CITIES IS BASICALLY AN EFFECT OF DECRIMINALIZATION TO TELL THE POLICE DEPARTMENT THAT THEY HAVE BETTER PRIORITIES. AND, YOU KNOW, WE DON'T REALLY GET TO TELL THE POLICE DEPARTMENT SABRINA EXACTLY WHAT WE DO, EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT. I FULLY SUPPORT A STRENGTHENED ICPOC FOR CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT, ESPECIALLY IN THE EVENTS OVER LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS. I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU GUYS IN THE FUTURE. [ APPLAUSE ]
00:53:27.211: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANKS. SO ONE LAST THING, I -- IT'S -- YEAH, THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENED WITH OUR ADMINISTRATOR. I'M GLAD WE HAVE A COMPETENT TEMPORARY ADMINISTRATOR WHO SERVED IN THAT POSITION TWICE IN THE PAST. I LOOK FORWARD, ESPECIALLY DURING OUR BUDGET CYCLE TO WORKING WITH MR. CRAWFORD BECAUSE IF ANYBODY KNOWS THE NUMBERS AT THIS CITY, IT'S MR. CRAWFORD. I HAVE BEEN GOING TO HIM FOR A YEAR OR SO WITH HELP, AND IT HAS BEEN VERY ENLIGHTENING. DC-5 WAS THE RESOLUTION THAT FOR THE CITY MANAGER. IT WAS NOT OFFERED UNLESS ALL PARTIES AGREED AND THERE WILL BE NO RECONSIDERATION OF THAT THROUGH THE CURRENT -- AS THE CURRENT RULES STAND. SO I APOLOGIZE TO FOLKS. I TALKED TO PEOPLE ABOUT THAT AND I FIELDED CALLS FROM STAFF AND SO ON. THEY REACHED OUT TO ME PRIVATELY AND I'M SORRY WE DON'T HAVE ANOTHER CHANCE FOR THAT CONVERSATION, AS FAR AS THE RULES STAND HERE. SO THANK YOU.
00:54:42.820: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
00:54:43.787: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I TOO WOULD LIKE TO THANK EVERYONE FOR COMING OUT AND IN PARTICULAR, I WOULD LIKE TO CALL OUT REVEREND EVANS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR SPEAKING ELOQUENTLY ON BEHALF OF REPRESENTING THE POLICE COMMISSION, THE CITIZENS OVERSIGHT COMMISSION. IT'S BEEN MY PLEASURE TO GET TO KNOW YOU BETTER, SERVING AS A COUNCIL LIAISON ALONG WITH COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI ON THAT COMMISSION, AND I THINK YOUR VOICE IN THIS MATTER, AND THE VOICE OF THE INDEPENDENT POLICE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION WILL BE INSTRUMENTAL IN HELPING US TO FIND THE BEST PATH FORWARD FOR ALL CONCERNED. AS YOU SAID THIS IS ABOUT SERVING THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE PUBLIC, AND -- AND THAT -- AND YOU ARE URGING US TO WORK TOGETHER IS -- IS A MESSAGE THAT I CERTAINLY HOPE WE TAKE TO HEART. THE -- YOU ALSO SAID IT IS IMPERATIVE TO WORK THROUGH OUR DIFFERENCES, EVEN WHEN WE DO NOT AGREE. I COULD NOT AGREE WITH YOU MORE. AND -- AND YOU AND MS. SAGINAW, WOULD SERVED ON THE TASK FORCE, HAVE -- HAVE STEPPED UP. AS OF ALL MEMBERS OF THE TASK FORCE AND ICPOC TO ASSIST US IN ADVANCING THIS CONVERSATION IN AI WAY THAT SERVES EVERYONE'S BEST INTEREST. SO THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH. I KNOW THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE HERE TONIGHT TO STAND IN SUPPORT OF WHAT YOU HAD TO SAY TONIGHT. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO COMMENT ON TWO THE ADMINISTRATOR'S COMMUNICATION ITEMS. FIRST, THOUGH, I SHOULD SAY I APIAPPRECIATE WHAT YOU HAD TO S, COUNCIL MEMBER RAMLAWI ABOUT YOUR PERSONAL POSITION AND TAKE ON THE SEPARATION AGREEMENT WITH THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR, AND WHAT HAS TRANSPIRED WITH REGARD TO CHIEF COX AND MOVING FORWARD. THAT IS -- YEAH, WE ALL -- THIS HAS BEEN A DIFFICULT PERIOD AND THERE'S MUCH MANY OF US WOULD LIKE TO SAY BUT WE ARE PROHIBITED FROM DISCUSSING. AND BECAUSE OF -- BECAUSE OF THE AGREEMENT, AND SO IT'S -- THAT POSES MORE DIFFICULTIES, OBVIOUSLY, FOR EVERYONE, BUT I THINK THAT IN THE INTEREST OF JUST MOVING FORWARD, AND COLLABORATING AND WORKING AS A TEAM, I WOULD LIKE TO FOCUS ON WHERE WE GO FROM HERE AND I WILL COMMENT SPECIFICALLY ON DC-4 AND DC-5 WHEN WE GET TO THOSE ITEMS. FOR NOW, JUST QUICKLY TWO OF THE ADMINISTRATORS COMMUNICATION ITEMS, THE CENTER OF THE CITY TASK FORCE REPORT AND THE COMMUNICATION ON THE NIXON CORRIDOR IMPROVEMENT PROJECT. I WOULD JUST SAY THAT IN TERMS OF THE CENTER OF THE CITY TASK FORCE, I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE FOLKS WOULD PARTICIPATED AND OBVIOUSLY WORKED VERY HARD ON THIS OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS. THE REPORT AND THE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE WELL THOUGHT OUT. THEY ARE BASED ON A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF PUBLIC INPUT, AND I THINK THEY STRIKE A GOOD BALANCE. THE VISION AND THE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE NOT TOO SPECIFIC, TO LIMIT FLEXIBILITY AND CREATIVITY AND YET THEY ARE SPECIFIC ENOUGH TO PROVIDE DIRECTION AND A FRAMEWORK. I THINK THESE RECOMMENDATIONS WILL BE VERY VALUABLE AS WE MOVE FORWARD, AND, AGAIN, SO I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE ENTIRE TEAM AND I'M GLAD THERE WILL BE MORE OPPORTUNITIES, AS YOU SAID, MR. CRAWFORD, FOR SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT. I'M A LITTLE LESS POSITIVE, HOWEVER, ABOUT THE NIXON CORRIDOR IMPROVEMENT PROJECT COMMUNICATION. BACK IN 2016, WHEN COUNCIL APPROVED THE LARGE NEW RESIDENTIAL PROJECT PROJECTS ONN ROAD WE ACKNOWLEDGED THE ALREADY PROBLEMATIC TRAFFIC CONGESTION ON NIXON AND IT WOULD BE EXACERBATED AND THE MAYOR AND COUNCIL COMMITTED TO PASSING THE BUDGET PROGRAM. THE FIRST PHASE BEGIN THIS UPCOMING FISCAL YEAR, FOR FISCAL YEAR  '21. STAFF DOES NOT RECOMMEND CONSIDER YOU CANNING PHASE ONE OF THE THREE PHASE PROJECT UNTIL FISCAL YEAR 2025 AT THE EARLIEST. THE RATIONALE PROVIDED IS THAT IN ORDER TO MEET THE CITY TARGET OF 80% OF YOU ARE STREETS AND GOOD OR BETTER CONDITION BY 2025, THE FOCUS OVER AT LEAST THE NEXT FOUR YEARS WILL BE ON STREET RESURFACING AND CAPITAL MAINTENANCE PROJECTS RATHER THAN ON MAJOR RECONSTRUCTION PROJECTS LIKE THIS ONE. I DO AGREE THAT MEETING THAT TARGET IS A KEY CITY PRIORITY AND ALTHOUGH I CAN UNDERSTAND THE STRATEGY, IT'S STILL VERY DISAPPOINTING TO ME, THAT IT WILL BE AT LEAST 10 YEARS, IF AT ALL, BEFORE THE CITY MEETS THE CLEAR COMMITMENT WE MADE TO THESE NIXON AREA NEIGHBORS. I DO NOT THINK THIS IS AN ACCEPTABLE OUTCOME, SO STAY TUNED. ANY WAY, THE IMPORTANT TAKEAWAY FROM THIS IS FOR US, AS WE ESTABLISH A SPENDING BUDGET FOR NEXT YEAR TO REMEMBER THAT THE CITY HAS OTHER IMPORTANT QUALITY OF LIFE NEEDS AND PRIORITIES BEYOND THE TWO THAT WE TALK ABOUT ALL THE TIME, AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND CLIMATE ACTION. THANK YOU.
01:00:23.627: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER COMMUNICATIONS FROM COUNCIL. COUNCILMEMBER GRAND?
01:00:26.697: >> Councilmember Grand: THANK YOU. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK EVERYONE FOR. COULDCOMING OUT TONIGHT.THIS HAW WEEKS HERE AT THE CITY. FOR A LOT OF US. AND WHILE I'M CERTAINLY VERY MUCH IN FAVOR OF WORKING FORWARD ON THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE PEOPLE. I TAKE ISSUE WITH SOME OF OUR COLLEAGUES BY NORMALIZING THEIR ACTIONS AND NOT TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEM. THESE ACTIONS HAVE BEEN EXTRAORDINARILY DISRUPTIVE, AND AS YOU CAN SEE, WE HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH A LOT OF OTHER ISSUES TONIGHT. WE ARE GOING TO BE DISCUSSING IN CLOSED SESSION, THE GELMAN LITIGATION. WE HAVE THIS ISSUE THAT'S COME UP WITH THE CHIEF OF POLICE. AND SO WHAT I REALLY WANT TO DO, ONE MR. CRAWFORD FOR BEING HERE AND STICKING WITH US, BUT I ALSO WANT TO SAY A BIG THANK YOU TO THE CITY STAFF WHO STUCK BY US THESE LAST FEW WEEKS. I RECOGNIZE HOW DIFFICULT IT HAS BEEN CARRY FORWARD UNDER THESE VERY TRYING CIRCUMSTANCES. I SEE THAT. I SUPPORT YOU. YOU ARE HAVING TO DO EVEN MORE WITH LESS. I WANT TO GIVE A BIG THANKS TO OUR CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE BECAUSE EVERY TIME I OPEN MY EMAIL, THERE SEEMS TO BE ANOTHER MESSAGE OF SUPPORT AND INFORMATION THAT'S BEEN REALLY HELPFUL FROM MR. POSTEMA AND HIS STAFF. SO WE HAVE -- YOU KNOW, I JUST REALLY WANT TO SAY HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE THE COMMITMENT THAT THE 750 OR SO INDIVIDUALS WHO MANY ARE -- MANY WHO ARE HERE IN THE ROOM TONIGHT OR REALLY DOING THEIR BEST TO -- TO BE COMMITTED TO THE CITY, TO SERVE ALL OF THE RESIDENTS WHO ARE HERE. AND I JUST WANT THEM TO KNOW AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN THIS NEXT BUDGET CYCLE, THAT I SEE THAT. I APPRECIATE IT, AND I'M GOING TO DO MY BEST TO DO MY PART TO GET US TOWARDS HEALING AND I THINK WE HAVE A LOT ON THE AGENDA TONIGHT THAT'S HOPEFULLY GOING TO MOVE US IN THAT DIRECTION, AND I APPRECIATE EVERYONE WHO HAS COME OUT TONIGHT, WHO HAS MADE STATEMENTS ABOUT HOW WE CAN MOVE FORWARD. I REALLY DO APPRECIATE THAT. I'M GLAD I HELPED YOU.
01:02:47.070: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
01:02:48.472: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WANT TO REINFORCE WHAT MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID. ITS TIME TO MOVE FORWARD. IT'S THE TIME TO BE THANKFUL FOR THE STAFF THAT WE HAVE. AND I ALSO WANT TO THANK SOME OF THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO HAVE SENT INFORMATION REGARDING STREETLIGHTS AND ROADWAY LIGHTING AS WELL AS THE NEED TO KEEP OUR SIDEWALKS SHOVELED AND SAFE AND ICE-FREE FROM THE RIDGES. THAT MAY SOUND LIKE A MINOR ISSUE, GIVEN EVERYTHING THAT WE ARE DEALING WITH TONIGHT, BUT I WANT TO READ SOMETHING FROM THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL" WHICH TENDS TO BE A MORE CONSERVATIVE PUBLICATION AND THAT IS, THEY ARE REPORTING ON THE GOVERNOR'S HIGHWAY SAFETY ASSOCIATION REPORT, AND TALKING ABOUT HOW PEDESTRIAN DEATHS HAVE GONE UP SIGNIFICANTLY, AND -- BUT ONE SENTENCE THAT I WANT TO FOCUS ON IS FROM 2009 TO 2018, THE NUMBER OF PEDESTRIANS KILLED IN CRASHES AFTER DARK HAS JUMPED 67% COMPARED WITH A 16% RISE IN DAYTIME PEDESTRIAN FAY  FATALIT. WE CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT. THAT'S NOT LIKE CARBON NEUTRALITY. THAT'S NOT LIKE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THOSE ARE GOALS THAT WE HAVE TO REACH, BUT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S VERY, VERY SIMPLE AND JUST TAKES A FOCUS ON PROVIDING THE LIGHTING THAT WE NEED. AND I WANT TO TALK ABOUT TWO THINGS THAT I WOULD LIKE TO REFER TO THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION. ONE IS THE LIGHTING, AND I WANT TO INCLUDE THE PROPOSED DARK SKIES ORDINANCE THAT IS STILL MAKING ITS WAY THROUGH THE -- I BELIEVE THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION. BECAUSE MORE LIGHTING, BRIGHTER LIGHTING IS NOT ALWAYS THE BEST LIGHTING. AND SO WE HAVE TO DO IT SMARTLY. SO I WOULD LIKE THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION TO LOOK AT THIS TOPIC AND WITHIN THE SCOPE AND THE FRAMEWORK OF THE CROSSWALK DESIGN GUIDELINES, WHICH AT THIS POINT DO NOT INCLUDE ANY LIGHTING. SO AS A RESULT, WE HAVE CONSTRUCTED MANY NEW CROSSWALKS WITHOUT ANY LIGHTING. WE HAVE MORE THAN 10 CROSSWALKS THAT ARE ALMOST IDENTICAL TO THE CROSSWALK WHERE WE LOST A YOUNG MAN IN OCTOBER OF 2016. THIS IS SHAMEFUL THAT WE ARE DUPLICATING THAT DANGEROUS SITUATION. OKAY? THE OTHER THING I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS A PROACTIVE PROGRAM FOR PEDESTRIAN SAFETY RELATED TO THE ORDINANCES THAT WE HAVE ON THE BOOKS THAT CAN EASILY BE REVISED TO IMPROVE PEDESTRIAN SAFETY, GET MORE PEOPLE OUT THERE WALKING, OUT OF THEIR CARS, AND THAT IS LOOKING AT THE SNOW CLEARING ORDINANCE. RIGHT NOW IT IS HARDLY ENFORCED AND PEOPLE ARE REPORTING HALF THE SIDEWALKS JUST ARE NOT CLEARED. ALSO LOOKING AT THE VEGETATION ORDINANCE. THERE'S NO SENSE HAVING SIDEWALKS IF YOU CAN'T WALK ON THEM AND YOU ARE STILL WALKING IN THE STREET. AND ALSO ADDRESSING THE SNOW AND THE ICE RIDGES THAT ARE LEFT AT THE CROSSWALK RAMPS. WE NEED TO BE SMARTER ABOUT THAT. AND SO I WOULD LIKE THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION TO LOOK AT THESE TWO AREAS AND SEE IF WE CAN MAKE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE SAFETY. THANKS.
01:06:36.499: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER COMMUNICATION FROM COUNCIL. COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
01:06:39.502: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES, THANK YOU, MAYOR TAYLOR. I HAVE A FEW ANNOUNCEMENTS. THERE ARE TWO SURVEYS AVAILABLE. ONE IS OUR OWN OFFICE OF SUSTAINABILITY AND INNOVATIONS, DR. MISSY STULTS HAS HER THIRD SURVEY IN THE A2O.ORG SEQUENCE AND THAT'S AVAILABLE UNTIL MARCE TO A2O.ORG AND FILL OUT YOUR FEELINGS ABOUT CARBON NEUTRALITY AND COMPLETE THAT SURVEY. AND OUR SECOND SURVEY FROM THE CITY, IS THROUGH JENNIFER HALL WITH THE HOUSING COMMISSION. A RESIDENT SENT US AN ARTICLE ABOUT HOW SOME OF THE ZONING THAT THE CITY OF MINNEAPOLIS HAS DONE WITH THE SINGLE FAMILY ZONING, UP ZONING TO QUAD PLEXES AND TRIPLEXES, THEY DIDN'T INSTALL IN THEIR ORDINANCE ANY METRICS FOR SUCCESS. AND SO OUR SURVEY HERE IN ANN ARBOR IS ON THE A2GGOV.ORG HOUSING PAGE. IT'S DESIGNED TO GATHER FEEDBACK FROM LOW-INCOME RENTERS AND HOMEOWNERS ABOUT HOW OUR HOUSING POLICIES MIGHT AFFECT THEM, SUCH AS IF THEY MOVED DOWNTOWN, HOW THAT AFFECTS THEIR HOUSING COSTS FROM WHERE THEY MAY BE LIVING FURTHER OUT. SO PLEASE PAY ATTENTION TO THOSE TWO SURVEYS, AND COMPLETE THOSE. I ALSO WANTED TO SAY THAT THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR IS HIRING PEOPLE THIS IS UPPER AND WE HAVE A LOT OF POSITIONS AVAILABLE AT OUR POOLS AND THE GOLF COURSES. SO PLEASE GO TO A2GOV.COM/JJOBS. AND WE ARE LOOKING FOR YOUTH MEMBERS TO APPLY TO SERVE ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION, AND THEN, ON THE TREES ISSUES, WE HAVE TWO UPDATES THERE, FOR THE 2857 PACKARD LOCATION AND THE HISTORIC COLLINS HOUSE. WE RECEIVED WORD TODAY THAT THERE WILL BE A TOUR, A SMALL GROUP TOURING THAT PROPERTY TO GET A CLOSER LOOK AT THE COLLINS HOUSE POSSIBLE RELOCATION OF IT. AND ALSO TO RESCUE SOME ACORNS FROM THE PROPERTY. AND NATURAL FEATURES COMMITTEE OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION MET LAST FRIDAY AND WE'RE DOING SOME REALLY EXCITING THINGS USING LIDAR TECHNOLOGY TO TAKE AN INVENTORY OF OUR TREES. AND LASTLY, I WANT TO GIVE A HEARTY WELCOME TO BOTH TOM CRAWFORD AND POLICE CHIEF MICHAEL COX AND YOU HAVE MY FULL SUPPORT AS WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING TOGETHER. AND LASTLY, JUST TO REMIND EVERYONE THERE WILL BE ANOTHER COUNCIL CAUCUS ON SUNDAY NIGHT, MARCH 15. THANK YOU.
01:09:47.123: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER COMMUNICATION FROM COUNCIL. WITH RESPECT TO AUDIENCE SIGNS. I HAVE -- I NEGLECTED TO REMIND FOLKS IN THE AUDIENCE WITH SIGNS THAT SIGNS SHOULD BE PLACED BELOW SHOULDER LEVEL SO AS TO PERMIT PEOPLE BEHIND THEM TO SEE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THAT AS MY MISTAKE, MY APOLOGIES. I WOULD LIKE TO REQUEST CONFIRMATION OF THE FOLLOWING NOMINATIONS THAT WERE PLACED BEFORE YOU, FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION ON FEBRUARY 18, 2020, TO THE BOARD OF REVIEW, ANNE HARLOW, AND TO THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION, JUDAH GASHER. GARR BETTER. MOVED AND SECONDED? DISCUSSION? AYOU WILL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? THEY ARE CONFIRMED. I WOULD LIKE TO RECOMMEND THE FOLLOWING NOMINATION FOR YOUR COMMENT CONSIDERATION FOR THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION BREATH HAUTAMAKI. ALSO, I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A FEW MINUTES TO UPDATE RESIDENTS ABOUT THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR'S PLANNING AND COORDINATION EFFORTS RELATED TO THE CORONAVIRUS. THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL ARE IN AN ACTIVE COLLABORATION WITH THE WHAT,WASHTENAW COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND HOSPITALS AND THE WASHTENAW COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT IS THE LEAD AGENCY. THEY HAVE THE EXPERTISE TO ADDRESS INFECTIOUS DISEASE AND PANDEMICS. ACCORDING TO THE WASHTENAW COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT'S MOST RECENT UPDATE, NO CASES HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED IN WASHTENAW COUNTY, A NOR IN MICHIGAN. THEY RECOMMEND THE FOLLOWING PREVENTATIVE MEASURES FOR THE PUBLIC. PRACTICE GOOD HAND WASHING, STAY HOME IF YOU ARE SICK, AND COVER YOUR COSTS. FINALLY, WITH RESPECT TO MUNICIPAL OPERATIONS PLEASE BE ASSURED THAT THE CITY'S EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN PROVIDES A TEMPLATE FOR COORDINATING LARGE SCALE EVENTS, INCLUDING PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES. FOR MONTHS NOW, THE CITY'S EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT COORDINATOR HAS BEEN ENGAGED IN A PROJECT TO REVIEW AND STRENGTHEN CONTINUITY OPERATIONS PLANS FOR CRITICAL CITY SERVICES, SUCH AS POLICE, FIRE, PUBLIC WORKS, ELECTIONS, WATER, AND WASTEWATER. CONTINUITY OF OPERATIONS PLANNING EFFORTS WORK TO ENSURE THAT THESE SERVICES ARE MAINTAINED AND WILL BE MAINTAINED DURING THE POM STAFFING SHORTAGE FROM INFECTIOUS DISEASE OR OTHER IMPACTS SUCH AS POWER OUTAGES OR SEVERE WEATHER EVENTS. DTE ALSO ENGAGES IN SIMILAR CONTINUITY PLANNING TO PROVIDE UNINTERRUPTED PROVISION OF NATURAL GAS AND ELECTRICITY IN SIMILAR CONTEXTS. WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE SITUATION CLOSELY, COORDINATE WITH OUR LOCAL PARTNERS AND SHARE CITY UPSTATES AS NECESSARY AND USEFUL. PLEASE VISIT THE WASHTENAW COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT WEBSITE FOR THE MOST RECENT INFORMATION WHICH YOU CAN FIND AT WASHTENAW.ORG/HEALTH. WE NOW COME TO OUR CONCEPT AGENDA. MAY I HAVE A MOTION TO APPROVE THE CONSENT AGENDA, MOVED BY GRISWOLD, SECONDED BY LUMM. DISCUSSION OF THE CONSENT AGENDA. COUNCILMEMBER EATEN?
01:12:53.276: >> Councilmember Eaton: I WOULD LIKE TO PULL CA-5 AND CA-6.
01:13:03.953: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE CONCEPT AGENDA. ALL IN FAVOR OF THE CONSENT AGENDA WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CA-5 AND CA-6. [CHORUS OF AYES] ALL OPPOSED? I WILL TAKE THAT AS AN EXISTING BUT PEAK APPROVAL OF THE CONSENT AGENDA, UNANIMOUSLY WITH NINE COUNCILMEMBERS PRESENT. THUS SATISFYING THE EIGHT VOTE REQUIREMENT, THANK YOU, WITH RESPECT TO CA-13, WITH THE EXCEPTION, OF COURSE, OF CA-5 AND CA-6 WHICH ARE YET TO BE CONSIDERED. CA-5, RESOLUTION TO APPROVE THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR AND LOCAL 693 OF THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF FIREFIGHTERS, THE ANN ARBOR FIREFIGHTERS UNION, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2020, THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2024. MOVED BY EATON AND LUMM. COUNCILMEMBER EATON.
01:14:00.576: >> Councilmember Eaton: I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BUT I WANTED TO PULL IT OUT OF THE CONSENT AGENDA TO NOTE THAT OUR FIREFIGHTERS HAVE BEEN WORKING UNDER A TWO-TIER WAGE SCHEDULE SINCE THE RECESSION, IF I RECALL. AND THAT MAY HAVE BEEN AN IMPORTANT COST SAVINGS AT THE TIME, BUT I DON'T THINK THAT THAT CONCERN PERSISTS TO THIS DAY. A TWO-TIER WAGED SCHEDULE CAN BE VERY DIVISIVE IN THE WORKPLACE AND SO I'M VERY HAPPY THAT WE HAVE NEGOTIATED A MEANS OF ENDING THAT PROGRAM OVER THE COURSE OF THIS CONTRACT. THIS CONTRACT WILL BE FIVE YEARS LONG, WHICH WILL GIVE US ADDITIONAL LABOR STABILITY, AT THE SAME TIME, THAT WE ARE BRINGING ALL OF OUR FIREFIGHTERS ON TO THE SAME WAGE PROGRESSION. SO I'M HAPPY TO SEE THIS PROGRESS.
01:14:49.625: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? FOR MY PART, I WOULD LIKE TO -- OH, I'M SORRY. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
01:14:56.632: >> Councilmember Lumm: THAT'S OKAY. DO YOU WANT TO GO FIRST?
01:14:58.334: >> Mayor Taylor: IT'S ALL YOU.
01:14:59.669: >> Councilmember Lumm: OKAY. THANK YOU. SO WE HAVE TWO UNION CONTRACTS SETTLEMENT PROPOSALS BEFORE US TONIGHT, THIS ONE CA-5, FOR THE FIREFIGHTERS AND CA-6 FOR THE DEPUTY POLICE CHIEFS. I WILL SUPPORT CA-6 BUT NOT THIS PROPOSED SETTLEMENT FOR THE FIREFIGHTERS. I'MED TO SEE THAT FOR FIRST TIME -- I'M PLEASED TO SEE THAT FOR FIRST TIME, THE CITY AND THE FIREFIGHTERS WILL HAVE A LONG-TERM AGREEMENT IN PLACE. I BELIEVE MOST OF THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT ARE REASONABLE, THERE IS ONE CRITICAL COMPONENT MISSING. SEVERAL YEARS AGO NOW THE CITY BEGAN TRANSITIONING FROM A 100% DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION STRUCTURE TO A HYBRID PLAN. PARK DEFINED BENEFIT AND PARK DEFINED CONTRIBUTION FOR NEW HIRES. THE PLANNED STRUCTURE WAS NOT CHANGED FOR EXISTING EMPLOYEES. THE PROMISES MADE WOULD BE KEPT. THE CITY WAS FOLLOWING THE LEAD OF THE MANY EMPLOYERS, PUBLIC AND PRIVATE TO BEGIN TO ADDRESS LARGE LEGACY COST OBLIGATIONS. THE HYBRID PLAN WILL ULTIMATELY REDUCE VOLATILITY, AND PENSION COSTS FOR THE CITY AND I BELIEVE THE CITY WILL ULTIMATELY NEED TO TRANSITION TO A 100% DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PENSION STRUCTURE BUT THE HYBRID PLAN WAS A VERY GOOD FIRST STEP IN THAT DIRECTION. THE TRANSITION BEGAN WITH NONUNION EMPLOYEES SUBSEQUENTLY MOST OF THE CITY'S BARGAINING UNITS HAVE ADOPTED THE NEW PENSION STRUCTURE FOR NEW HIRES IN THEIR AGREEMENTS. FOR THIS AGREEMENT WITH THE FIREFIGHTERS, THE CITY PROPOSED THE HYBRID STRUCTURE FOR NEW HIRES, BUT THE FIREFIGHTERS REJECTED IT. BECAUSE I BELIEVE PENSION RESTRUCTURING AND ADDRESSING LEGACY OBLIGATIONS IS ESSENTIAL TO LONG-TERM FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY, I HAVE BEEN VOTING AGAINST THOSE CONTRACT SETTLEMENTS THAT DID NOT TRANSITION TO THE HYBRID PENSION STRUCTURE FOR THEIR NEW HIRES AND SIMILARLY WILL NOT VOTE FOR CA-5 TONIGHT. ON CA-6, THE DEPUTY CHIEFS HAVE PREVIOUSLY AGREED TO THE HYBRID STRUCTURE AND I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT.
01:17:12.168: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? I WILL BE DELIGHTED TO SUPPORT CA-5 AND CA-6. WITH RESPECT TO CA-5, I WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO THANK THE GOOD WORK DON'T OUTSIDE THE ROOM, BY 693, LOCAL  693 AND ITS MEMBERS BUT WITH RESPECT TO THIS NEGOTIATION, I WOULD LIKE TO THANK LOCAL 693 AND, OF COURSE, FIRE ADMINISTRATION, FIRE LEADERSHIP FOR THEIR WILLINGNESS, THEIR COLLECTIVE WILLINGNESS AND COLLECTIVE ABILITY TO WORK TOGETHER TO PUT TOGETHER A CONTRACT THAT MEETS COMMON GOALS AND ACHIEVES COMMON OBJECTIVES. THIS IS A CONTRACT THAT I BELIEVE TO BE GOOD FOR THE FIRE DEPARTMENT AND GOOD FOR THE CITY. I'M GLAD TO VOTE ON IT. FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
01:18:04.387: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I HAVE TO AGREE WITH WHAT COUNCILMEMBER LUMM SAID ON THIS. WE HAD THIS CONVERSATION, MANY, MANY TIMES, MS. LUMM. HERE IT IS, AND SITS BEFORE ME. I CERTAINLY DO SUPPORT OUR SAFETY SERVICES 100% BUT I'M DISAPPOINTED THAT WE GOT TO GO ANOTHER FIVE YEARS NOW BEFORE WE CAN -- AND WE KNOW HOW THE ECONOMY IS SUPER VOLATILE AND THE CHANGES WERE PUT IN PLACE FOR THE LONG-TERM STABILITY OF OUR CITY. AND THAT'S OVER 50% OF OUR BUDGET FULLY RIGHT NOW, AND I WOULD IMAGINE THAT THE PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS ARE SIMILARLY SCALED. THAT'S A BIG SC S STONE FOR US O CARRY AND IT'S NOT PUTTING IT ON THE BACKS OF THESE MEN AND WOMEN WHO SERVE US, BUT JUST GENERALLY THE PENSION OBLIGATIONS ARE A BIG BURDEN FOR THE CITY. IT CREATES AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE WE HAVE TO BE CONSTANTLY SEEKING REVENUE. AND ONE OF THE W WAYS WE CONSTANTLY SEEK REVENUE, IS CONSTANT BUILDING. WE NEED TO WORK UNDER THESE HUGE PENSION MANDATES DESPITE THE BEST EFFORTS TO TRIM THEM DOWN. I WANT TO SHARE AND EXPRESS MY CONCERN. I SUPPORT THESE CONTRACTS, BUT I GUESS I WILL SAY IN THIS CASE, I AM DISAPPOINTED AT THAT ONE ASPECT OF IT.
01:19:26.535: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
01:19:29.271: >> Counc
01:19:30.172: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I WASN'T GOING TO SPEAK. I WANT TO LEND MY SUPPORT TO THIS. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT, ESPECIALLY RIGHT NOW AS WE TRY TO ATTRACT THE BEST AND THE BRIGHTEST THAT WE HAVE A COMPENSATION PACKAGE THAT ATTRACTES THOSE TYPE OF PEOPLE AND FOR THAT REASON AND THIS TYPE OF EMPLOYMENT ENVIRONMENT, WITH LOW EMPLOYMENT NUMBERS AND HARD-TO-FIND STAFFING, I FEEL IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO -- TO -- IN ORDER TO HAVE A HIGHLY QUALIFIED FIRE AND POLICE DEPARTMENT THAT WE PROVIDE THESE BENEFITS AND I THINK IT'S A MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL RELATIONSHIP. AND SABR SO I LOOK FORWARD TO T.
01:20:14.483: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION?
01:20:18.220: >> Councilmember Grand: YES.
01:20:19.021: >> Councilmember Ackerman: ABSENT.
01:20:23.459: >> Mayor Taylor: YES.
01:20:24.059: >> Councilmember Eaton: YES.
01:20:24.660: >> Councilmember Nelson:  YES. COUNCILMEMBER SMITH ABSENT.
01:20:26.762: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES.
01:20:27.863: >> Councilmember Hayner:  YES.
01:20:29.231: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES.
01:20:30.900: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES.
01:20:35.137: >> Councilmember Lumm: NO. MOTION CARRIES.
01:20:38.073: >> Mayor Taylor: CA-6, THE RESOLUTION TO APPROVE THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR AND ANN ARBOR POLICE DEPUTY CHIEFS, TEAMSTERS LOCAL 214, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2019, THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2021.
01:20:52.922: >> Councilmember Eaton: SO THIS IS A BARGAIN UNIT WITH TWO MEMBERS IN IT. I WAS RATHER CONCERNED WITH ONE OF THE CHANGES IN THIS CONTRACT, WHICH ALLOWS DEPUTY CHIEFS TO TAKE A VEHICLE HOME, AND WE CAN'T PROHIBIT OUR EMPLOYEES FROM LIVING OUTSIDE THE CITY AND WHEN A DEPUTY CHIEF LIVES A LOLONGDISTANCE FROM TOWN, PROVIA CITY VEHICLE TO THAT CONCERN ACTUALLY SEEMS CONTRARY TO OUR CLIMATE GOALS. AND SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BUT I THINK WHEN WE NEGOTIATE CONTRACTS, WE SHOULD TRY TO ALSO EXPRESS OUR VALUES, AND ONE OF THOSE VALUES IS THAT WE WANT TO CUT DOWN ON THE AMOUNT OF CARBON THAT WE ARE PRODUCING. AND CREATING AND INCENTIVE TO LIVING A LONG DISTANCE FROM WORK IS NOT A WAY TO DO THAT. THANK YOU.
01:21:57.152: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? MY UNDERSTANDING -- WELL, OF COURSE, I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS AS WELL. I DON'T THINK FOR MY PART, THE PRO E VISION OF A VEHICLE IS -- THE PROVISION OF A VEHICLE IS NOT A PERK. THE PROVISION OF A VEHICLE IS A JOB BENEFIT. THAT IS TO SAY, IT'S A BENEFIT FOR THE JOB. IT IS A SAFETY NECESSITY. THE PERSONAL VEHICLES ARE NOT TO SUPPORT THE POLICE SERVICES. THE CITY-PROVIDED VEHICLES FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT ARE. AS A CONSEQUENCE, WE ASK OUR DEPUTY CHIEFS TO COME IN AT VARIOUS TIMES OF THE DAY, TO SUPPORT ON-SITE, IN PROGRESS ACTIONS AND WHEN WE CALL IN A DEPUTY CHIEF OR WHEN A CHIEF IS ON THE WAY IN FROM POINTS OUTSIDE THE CITY, WE DON'T WANT THEM COMING TO CITY HALL FOR 10 OR 15 MINUTES TO GO GET A CAR AND THEN GO TO THE SITE OF THE ENGAGEMENT. WE WANT THEM TO GO THERE DIRECTLY WITH SUFFICIENT MATERIALS FOR THEM TO DO THEIR WORK SAFELY. THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT. THIS IS NOT A JOB PERK. FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. WE NOW COME TO THE PUBLIC HEARINGS. YOU DO NOT NEED TO HAVE SIGNED UP IN ADVANCE TO SPEAK AT A PUBLIC HEARING, BUT YOUR SPEECH MUST RELATE TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THE PUBLIC HEARING. SPEAKERS WILL HAVE THREE MINUTES IN WHICH TO SPEAK. SO PLEASE PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE TIME CLOCK. AS A MATTER OF COURTESY, WE MAY HAVE ONLY ONE PERSON SPEAKING AT A TIME AND FINALLY, IF YOU REQUIRE ASSISTANCE IN SPEAKING BEFORE COUNCIL TODAY, WE WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO PROVIDE IT TO YOU. PUBLIC HEARING NUMBER ONE, Resolution to Approve The Standard at Ann Arbor Site Plan and Development Agreement at 405 South Main Street. IS THERE ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING?
01:24:11.153: >> CAN YOU HEAR ME IF I TALK LIKE THIS? YES, MY NAME IS ETHEL POTTS AT 1939 JACKSON ROAD. THIS IS -- THIS PROPOSAL IS A VERY LARGE BUILDING, AND IT IS ON A VERY PROMINENT PIECE OF LAND. A LONG BLOCK ON MAIN STREET AND SOME OF WILLIAM AND PACKARD STREETS. IT HAS BEEN CRITICIZED AT PAST HEARINGS FOR ITS HEIGHT AND ITS UNATTRACTIVEATTRACTIVE ARCHITECD IT'S ONLY ACCESS -- THIS IS IMPORTANT, THE ONLY ACCESS TO PEOPLE IN THE BUILDING IS BY AN ALLEY OFF OF PACKARD. THIS ONLY ACCESS MAKES THE PROJECT UNWORKABLE. PICTURE HUNDREDS OF CARS TRYING TO ACCESS THE PARKING GARAGES IN THE BUILDING. THEY WILL HAVE A NARROW 16-FOOT ALLEY, WHICH MAY BE WIDENED A LITTLE. AT THE SAME TIME, THE ALLEY IS ALSO USED BY GARBAGE TRUCKS, DELIVERY VANS, MAIL TRUCKS, MOVING VANS, AND MOST OF THESE HAVE TO STOP FOR A WHILE TO TRANSACT WHATEVER THEY WERE THERE FOR. SO THEY JUST DON'T -- SO THEY DON'T JUST MOVE THROUGH IT. THIS ALLEY PRESENTLY SERVES ALSO -- ALSO SERVES THE GARAGES AND BACKYARDS OF THE HOUSES ON 4th STREET. THIS IS AN ALLEY BETWEEN THIS BUILDING AND 4th STREET. WILL THE PRESENT RESIDENTS EVER BE ABLE TO GET THROUGH THE CROWDED ALLEY TO THEIR OWN GARAGES AND BACKYARDS PLANNING COMMISSION DID NOT HAVE ANY DISCUSSION OF THIS. I WAS AT THE PLANNING COMMISSION MEETING. THEY DID NOT CHOOSE TO DISCUSS THESE THINGS. I DON'T REMEMBER THAT THE STAFF REPORT HAD ANY DISCUSSION OF THE DIFFICULTIES THAT -- ALSO THE STAFF REPORT DID NOT INCLUDE WHAT I SEE AS A VIOLATION OF THE UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE. SEE PAGE 11, D1 AND D2 ZONING, WHICH REFERS TO CHARACTER AREA OVERLAYS. THIS ■ISFOUND ONPAGE67, SECTION 5:14. PLANNING COMMISSION STAFF NEVER BOTHERED TO DEAL WITH THIS. THE STANDARD -- THERE ARE SETBACKS REQUIRED BETWEEN ZONINGS. # IN THIS CASE, THE SETBACK IS REQUIRED BETWEEN THE PROPOSED DOWNTOWN DEZONING AND THE R RESIDENTIAL ZONING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ALLEY. WHAT IS REQUIRED IS A 30-FOOT SEPARATION BETWEEN TWO DIFFERENT ZONINGS. A VIOLATION MAKES THIS BUILDING, HAVE YOU LOOKED INTO THIS? I DON'T THINK PLANNING HAS. IT WASN'T MENTIONED. IS THERE AT LEAST 30 FEET BETWEEN THE BUILDING, THE NEW PROPOSED BUILDING AND THE RESIDENTIAL ZONING ACROSS THE ALLEY? I HOPE YOU WILL -- WITH ONLY ONE ALLEY ACCESS, I THINK THIS PLAN IS UNWORKABLE.
01:27:21.510: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. [ APPLAUSE ]
01:27:36.291: >> MY NAME IS RAFFLE OF McKEANAN. -- RALPH McKEANAN. I WILL FOCUS ON THE TRAFFIC ISSUES. THE BASICS HERE ARE THAT THERE'S 400 RESIDENTS AND 100 PARKING SPACES, MANY OF WHOM WILL BE STUDENTS. THERE WILL BE MANY DELIVERIES AND UBERS AND LYFTS AND DROPOFFS OF MERCHANDISE, ET CETERA. I HAVEN'T SEEN THE ACTUAL TRAFFIC STUDY BECAUSE THAT WASN'T IN THE MATERIALS THAT I WOULD ACCESS, AT LEAST THAT I COULD FIGURE OUT TO GET THEM. DID I LOOK AT THE TRAFFIC SUMMARY, AND THAT SUMAR, IT IS ESSENTIALLY THESE RESIDENTS WE DON'T THINK WILL DRIVE UP MANY. THE DEVELOPER ALSO SAID AT THE PLANNING COMMISSION MEETING THAT THIS WILL BE LESS CARS THAN THE 160 CARS THAT USED TO WORK THERE WHEN DPTE OPERATED THAT OFFICE BUILDING, BUT THAT'S NOT APPLICABLE HERE BECAUSE THEN THERE WAS A -- THERE WAS AN ENTRANCE FROM MAIN STREET WHICH IS NOT IN THIS PROPOSAL. SO I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S AN APPLICABLE FACT. THE -- HERE, YOU HAVE GOT AN ALLEY THAT IS 16 FEET AT THE MAXIMUM. IF YOU TAKE TWO F-150s, THEY CAN'T DO THIS. THEY CAN'T MAKE IT THROUGH THERE, AS IT STANDS NOW. SORRY. THERE'S NO PROPOSAL FOR WIDENING IT EXCEPT AT THE PACKARD END AND AT THE OTHER END, WHAT WAS REALLY DISCONCERTING TO ME, HAVING WALKED THAT SITE AND GONE THERE, THE ALLEY ON THE WILLIAMS STREET SIDE IS 10 FEET. THAT'S IT. YOU CAN BARELY GET A DELIVERY TRUCK THROUGH. I WENT THERE AND THIS WAS A TRUCK DRIVER DELIVERING STUFF TO THE BEER VAULT. YOU CAN'T EVEN WALK THROUGH THERE. THERE IS NOTHING IN THE TRAFFIC STUDY THERE. WAS NOTHING AT THE PLANNING COMMISSION MEETING TO EVEN DEAL WITH THAT. AND THAT AT LEAST FOR ME UNDERMINES CONFIDENCE IN THAT PIECE OF THE ANALYSIS, BECAUSE YOU CAN'T HAVE DOZENS OF CARS -- IMAGINE FIRST LABOR DAY WEEKEND, MOVE-IN FOR STUDENTS, FOOTBALL GAME TRAFFIC. IMAGINE MAKING A LEFT FROM MAIN STREET TO PACKARD, OR MAIN STREET TO WILLIAM, IF THOSE -- IF THAT ALLEY IS JAMMED IN WITH PARENTS BRINGING THEIR KIDS TO SCHOOL. IT'S COMPLETELY CRAZY! AND THAT WAS NOT DEALT WITH AT ALL IN ANY OF THE THINGS THAT I COULD ACCESS. SO -- AND THERE ARE ALSO 20 PRIVATE -- OR MORE, PRIVATE PARKING SPACES BACK THERE. THEY WILL HAVE TO ACCESS -- BE ABLE TO BACK UP. THERE'S RESIDENTS WHOSE DRIVEWAYS BACK UP THERE. THERE ARE REGULAR EMERGENCY VEHICLES THAT GO UP PACKARD. IF THAT'S JAMMED, THOSE VEHICLES ARE NOT GETTING THROUGH. EVERY SINGLE RESIDENT WHO CAME TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION POINTED OUT THESE TRAFFIC PROBLEMS, AND THERE IS REALLY NO COMPREHENSIVE RESPONSE.
01:30:35.837: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING? JUST COME ON UP.
01:30:53.989: >> GOOD EVENING, MY NAME IS JOHN MIEFSKI, WE ARE THE ARCHITECTS FOR THIS PROJECT. I DID WANT TO POINT OUT AND I WILL ADDRESS SEVERAL OF THE PREVIOUS ISSUES. WE HAD QUITE A PUBLIC OUTREACH PROCESS ON THIS PROJECT. WE HAD EIGHT NEIGHBORHOOD MEETINGS WHICH HAVE SPANNED OVER THE COURSE OF ABOUT 20 MONTHS. THREE DESIGN REVIEW MEETINGS, AND ONE PLANNING COMMISSION THAT LED TO US BEING HERE TONIGHT. KIND OF PRIMARY FOCUS THAT REALLY CAME OUT OF THOSE MEETINGS WAS A LOT OF WORK ON THE ALLEY. IT'S DISHEARTENING TO HEAR THAT WE DIDN'T ADDRESS IT. WE CERTAINLY DID AND WE MADE A LOT OF CHANGES BECAUSE OF THE ALLEY AND THOSE CHANGES HAD A LOT TO DO WITH FIRST, HOW WE ACCESSED THE GARAGE. THE GARAGE ITSELF USED TO HAVE A SINGLE POINT OF ACCESS WITHIN THE ALLEY. AND THAT'S BEEN CHANGED TO HAVE TWO POINTS OF ACCESS, SO THE CARS ARE SPLIT BASICALLY IN HALF OFF OF THE ALLEY WITH THE INTENTION THAT THE VEHICLES COULD GO TO THE NORTH OR THES COULD GO TO THE SOUTH, SO IT BREAKS UP THAT TRAFFIC FLOW. IT'S PART OF A PLAN THAT WE SHOWED FOR PEOPLE MOVING IN AND OUT, THE PARKING GARAGES THEMSELVES ARE USED FOR THE MOVE IN AND MOVE OUT PERIOD AND IT'S VERY SCHEDULED AND VERY ORGANIZED. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE NEIGHBORS ASKED US WAS TO ADDRESS RIDE SHARE. WE KNOW THE CITY IS LOOKING AT THAT. BUT WE FELT IT WAS IMPORTANT THAT WE LEAD THE WAY. SO WE PROVIDED TWO RIDESHARE SPACES OFF OF THE ALLEY THAT ARE DEDICATED FOR RIDESHARE. WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING WITH UBER AND LYFT TO ACTUALLY HAVE THAT PROGRAMMED LIKE IT DOES AT THE AIRPORT. SO THEY WOULD KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO GO. A LOT OF IT HAD TO DO WITH LANDSCAPING. LANDSCAPING IN THE ALLEY WAS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND WE DID PROVIDE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF THAT, AS WAS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED, WE DID WIDEN THE ALLEY FROM THE SOUTHERN PARKING ENTRANCE TO PACKARD. WE ADDED FOUR ELECTRIC EV CHARGING STATIONS WITH THE ADDITIONAL ABILITY TO ADD MORE. AND I THINK OVERALL, WE REALLY JUST WANTED TO EMPHASIZE THAT PEDESTRIAN SAFETY WAS THE NUMBER ONE GOAL ON THIS PROJECT FOR US AND THE BUILDING ITSELF WAS PUSHED BACK SEVEN AND A HALF FEET OFF OF WILLIAMS, WHICH WAS A TREMENDOUS DESIGN CHANGE TO ACCOMMODATE THE CITY AND THE DOWNTOWN'S GUIDELINES TO HAVE A WIDER STREET ALONG WILLIAMS FOR MORE ACCESS FOR DIFFERENT PEDESTRIAN EVENTS. AND THERE WAS A LOT OF CONFIGURATION AND ARCHITECTURE THAT REALLY CHANGED THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS. AND THEY ARE SMALL. THEY ARE BIG, THERE ARE LARGE MOVES AND A LOT HAD TO DO WITH MATERIAL. ONE OF THE THINGS WE WERE ASKED TO DO, WE ALSO INCLUDED WAS THE ABILITY TO HAVE TWO ART MURALS ON THE PROJECT AND WE'LL WORK WITH THE ANN ARBOR ARTS CENTER TO FIND THE ARTIST TO DO THOSE ART MURALS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY WE WANTED TO EMPHASIZE THAT THAT THIS WAS A LEED SILVER PROJECT AND THAT INCLUDES A NUMEROUS NUMBER OF FEATURES WHICH I WILL BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO RUN THROUGH, IF YOU WOULD LIKE ME TO TALK ABOUT THEM. AND I THINK VERY IMPORTANTLY, WE DID WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THROUGHOUT THIS WHOLE PROCESS, WE DID FIND A WAY OF WORKING THIS TOGETHER TO CREATE A BUY RIGHT DESIGN.
01:33:54.836: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
01:33:59.607: >> HOHI, COUNCIL, I'M ADAM OXNER AND I LIVE IN WARD 4. I WANTED TO SAY, I'M EXCITED TO SEE A PROJECT THAT HAS MIXED USE WITH RETAIL ON THE STREET WHICH IS CURRENTLY A PARKING LOT MORE OR LESS, AND I THINK THAT IT -- IN TERMS OF COMPARING IT TO SOME OF THE OTHER BUILDINGS IN DOWNTOWN, I LIKE THAT IT'S NOT MORE OR LESS A WALLED -- A BIG WALL, I GUESS FOR PEDESTRIANS WALKING BY. IT SEEMS LIKE AT LEAST THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON ON THAT CORNER, WHICH WOULD BE BENEFICIAL TO ME, BECAUSE WHEN I WALK DOWNTOWN, THAT'S -- OR HOME, THAT'S WHERE I GO. SO I THINK IN -- I JUST WANTED TO EXPRESS MY SUPPORT FOR THESE NEW BEDS THAT WILL BE IN TOWN WITH SOME MIXED DEVELOPMENT ON THE PEDESTRIAN LEVEL. THANK YOU.
01:34:56.664: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING? SEEING NO ONE THIS PUBLIC HEARING IS CLOSED. PUBLIC HEARING NUMBER TWO, Resolution to Approve the Lohmann Annexation, 1.52 Acres, 2511 Newport Road. IS THERE ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING? SEEING NO ONE, THIS PUBLIC HEARING IS CLOSED. A-1, WORK SESSION OF FEBRUARY 10 AND REGULAR SESSION MINUTES OF FEBRUARY 18, 2020, MAY I HAVE A MOTION TO APPROVE PLEASE MINUTED, MOVED BY RAMLAWI AND LUMM. DISCUSSION OF A-1? ALL IN FAVOR?

MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRAND? DID ISSUE DISCUSSION OF C-1? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
01:36:12.140: >> Councilmember Hayner:  IF I'M READING THIS PROPERLY, THIS IS THE SPOT NEXT TO STADIUM HARDWARE. IT WAS THE OLD CHINESE RESTAURANT SPACE. SO, YOU KNOW, IT'S BEEN UP THERE FOR A WHILE, AND I KNOW I HAD THESE KIND OF PIPE DREAMS, I GUESS YOU WOULD CALL THEM ABOUT OUR TRANSIT CORRIDOR DEVELOPMENT. AND WE WERE ALL STANDING AROUND AND TALKING WITH A GUY WHO IS ON ONE OF OUR BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS HERE. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IT, AND, YOU KNOW, WE HAD THIS VISION IN OUR MIND THAT THAT SPACE WOULD BE THIS AWESOME MIXED THING WITH LIVING ABOVE IT AND APARTMENTS AND IT WOULD SET THE TONE FOR THE USE OF THESE TRANSIT CORRIDORS BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE THAT, OF COURSE. AND IT'S NOT UP TO US THE WHAT I IT'S ZONED. I WISH IT WAS GOING TO BE THE KIND OF BUILDINGS WE WANT TO PUT IN THESE T-1 PROJECTS IN THE FUTURE. I'M KIND OF BEING OVERWHELMED BY THE NOTIONS THAT DECISIONS I MAKE HERE AT THE TABLE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE -- ESPECIALLY AROUND BUILDING AND ZONING ARE DECISIONS THAT I'M MAKING FOR MY KIDS, FOR THE YEAR 2030, THAT WE MADE THESE COMMITMENTS TO THAT YEAR AND OUR GOALS FOR THAT YEAR AND I'M HAVING A HARD TIME WITH THE PROJECTS THAT ARE JUST KIND OF PR PROJECTS THAT DON'T FIT OR ASPIRASPIRATIONS AS A COMMUNITYT WE MADE THESE COMMITMENTS TO. THAT'S THE WAY IT GOES RIGHT NOW, BUT I'M HOPEFUL FOR BETTER PROJECTS, I GUESS IS WHAT I WILL SAY UNTIL WE CAN GET AROUND TO HAVING THE AUTHORITY THAT WE CAN -- WE CAN KIND OF THINGS WE EXACTLY WANT IN YOU'RE COMMUNITY IN THE FUTURE. FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED.

01:38:33.948: >> Councilmember Eaton: I WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A COMMUNITY.
01:38:37.885: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU FOR COSPONSORING THIS ALONG WITH ACKERMAN, BANNISTER AND GRAND AND I. AND BRIEFLY WHAT THIS RESOLUTION DOES IS TO DIRECT THE ADMINISTRATOR TO SEND THE ATTACHED LETTER TO THE CHAIRS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEES ON TRANSPORTATION, HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT IN SUPPORT OF INCREASED FEDERAL FUNDING IN FISCAL YEAR '21 FOR H.U.D. SECTION  4 PROGRAM. THIS CAPACITY BUILDING PROGRAM PROVIDES FUNDING FOR NON-PROS TO SUPPORT AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AND OUR LOCAL NONPROFITS HAVE ASKED THE CITY TO SEND THIS LETTER OF SUPPORT. A COPY OF THE LETTER WOULD BE PROVIDED TO OUR REPRESENTATIVES IN THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE. SO I'M ASSUMING AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN ALL SUPPORT THIS TONIGHT. THANK YOU.
01:39:18.760: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. DC4, RESOLUTION TO ACCEPT COUNCIL ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION REGARDING THE INTERRIM CITY ADMINISTRATOR. MOVED BY LUMM. AND SECONDED. COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
01:39:38.046: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU. THIS IS SPONSORED BY THE COUNCIL ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE. THIS IS TO APPOINT TOM CRAWFORD EFFECTIVE TODAY AND UNTIL A PERMANENT ADMINISTRATOR IS APPOINTED. HE WILL RECEIVE THE SAME SALARY MR. LAZARUS WAS BEING PAID. THE RESOLUTION FURTHER STATES THAT MR. CRAWFORD CAN RETURN TO HIS CURRENT POSITION WITH 30 DAYS' NOTICE TO COUNCIL AND ALSO ACKNOWLEDGES THAT MANY CRAWFORD MAY REQUEST ADDITIONAL OVERHIRE FUNDING TO ADDRESS WORKLOAD CHALLENGES THAT RESULT FROM HIS INTERIM APPOINTMENT. THIS OVERHIRE FUNDING HAS BEEN IN OUR BUDGE ELIMINATE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. THIS IS NOT A NEW LINE ITEM. AND OTHER DEPARTMENTS HAVE USED THIS FUNDING FOR -- IN SUPPORT OF SUCCESSION PLANNING. MR. CRAWFORD SERVED VERY EFFECTIVELY AS INTERIM CITY ADMINISTRATOR PREVIOUSLY. THE COMMITTEE IS CONFIDENT HE WILL DO SO AGAIN AND WE APPRECIATE HIS WILLINGNESS TO TAKE ON THIS RESPONSIBILITY. TOM'S OBVIOUSLY QUITE FAMILIAR WITH CITY OPERATIONS AND I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT WE ALL HAVE THE UTMOST RESPECT FOR TOM. RESPECT HE'S EARNED OVER MANY YEARS OF EXCELLENT WORK AND LEADERSHIP AS OUR C.F.O. THE COUNCIL ADMINISTRATION RECOMMENDS YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS INTERIM APPOINTMENT AND THANK YOU, MR. CRAWFORD FOR YOUR WILLINGNESS TO STEP UP. THANK YOU.
01:41:08.836: >> Mayor Taylor: FOR MY PART, WITHOUT REGARD TO EVENTS THAT OCCURRED IN THE PAST AND HOW WE GOT HERE, I HAVE THE GREATEST AND HIGHEST REGARD FOR MANY CRAWFORD AND, YOU KNOW, HE HAS SERVED THE CITY WELL IN A VARIETY OF CAPACITIES AND WILL -- MAY NOT WILL, WITH DISTINCTION, IN A VARIETY OF CAPACITIES AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO HERE. I HAVE ENJOYED WORKING WITH MR. CRAWFORD IN THE PAST. I KNOW AS ALL WHO HAVE WORKED WITH HIM AND VERY MUCH LOOK FORWARD TO -- TO WORKING WITH MR. CRAWFORD IN THE FUTURE. THE COUNCIL, THE COMMUNITY, CITY STAFF, WE ARE IN GOOD HANDS WITH MR. CRAWFORD AT THE HELM. FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD?
01:41:54.916: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I WANTED TO MENTION THAT I'M A MEMBER OF THE COUNCIL ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE AND I ALREADY VOTED IN FAVOR OF MR. CRAWFORD.
01:42:09.564: >> Mayor Taylor: MR. RAMLAWI?
01:42:10.198: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I WOULD LIKE TO ECHO THE SENTIMENTS OF MR. CRAWFORD AND HIS ABILITIES AND TRUST THAT HE HAS WITH COUNCIL, THAT HE'S GOING TO -- HE'S UP FOR THE TASK AND HE'S APPROACHING IT WITH PURE OPTIMISM, AND I JUST AM THANKFUL THAT WE HAVE SOMEONE LIKE THAT IN CITY GOVERNMENT, WILLING TO TAKE ON AND DO WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND JUST THE UTMOST RESPECT AND APPRECIATION FOR THAT. THANK YOU.
01:42:36.624: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION. ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED.
01:42:44.565: >> Mayor Taylor: WELCOME, MR. CRAWFORD. DC-5, RESOLUTION REGARDING THE ANN ARBOR POLICE CHIEF. MOVED BY LUMM AND SECONDED BY GRAND. DISCUSSION OF DC-5, COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
01:42:55.576: >> Councilmember Lumm: THIS RESOLUTION IS ALSO SPONSORED BY THE COUNCIL ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE. SPECIFICALLY, THE RESOLUTION DIRECTS THAT THE DOCUMENTS RELATED TO CHIEF COX'S ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE BE PROVIDED TO THE CITY CLERK AND THE RESOLUTION ALSO ARTICULATES COUNCIL'S ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF KEY CONSIDERATIONS ARISING INVESTIGATION OF THE INCIDENT AND THE CHIEF'S RESPONSE AND REACTION. THIS HAS CERTAINLY BEEN DIFFICULT FOR EVERYONE INVOLVED AND THERE ARE IMPORTANT LESSONS TO BE LEARNED IN SEVERAL RESPECTS AND RELATIONSHIPS TO BE STRENGTHENED. IT'S NOT PRODUCTIVE TO GET INTO THESE TONIGHT, BUT I'M VERY HOPEFUL THAT THIS RESOLUTION CAN HELP SERVE AS A CATALYST TO MOVE BEYOND THE SPECIFIC INCIDENT, TO LEARN FROM IT AND TO BUILD AN EVEN STRONGER INNER POLICE DEPARTMENT, INTERNALLY AND EXTERNALLY. IN THAT SPIRIT, I WANT TO THANK REVEREND EVANS AGAIN FOR SPEAKING TO US ON THE MATTER FROM THE INDEPENDENT POLICE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION'S PERSPECTIVE. AND I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK MS. SAGINAW FOR SHARING HER PERSPECTIVE AS THE FORMER -- AS THE CHAIR OF THE TASK FORCE. ICPOC PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE AS THE PRIMARY LIAISON TO THE COMMUNITY, AND I BELIEVE IT'S IN EVERYONE'S BEST INTEREST TO CONSULT AND ENGAGE ICPOC EARLY ON AND TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE AND DESIRED, IN SITUATIONS LIKE THIS. NOW THAT THE INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN COMPLETED AND ALL THE PARTIES HAVE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND, WHICH, OF COURSE, WAS ABSOLUTELY APPROPRIATE AND THE RIGHT THING TO DO, IT REALLY IS IN THE CITY'S BEST INTEREST TO MOVE ON. THAT'S NOT TO SAY IGNORE WHAT HAS HAPPENED OR WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED, BUT JUST THE OPPOSITE. TO LEARN FROM THE EXPERIENCE AND MOVE FORWARD, TO TURN THIS IN A POSITIVE OPPORTUNITY, TO IMPROVE THE ANN ARBOR POLICE DEPARTMENT, ITS RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE COMMUNITY. I HAVE COMPLETE CONFIDENCE IN CHIEF COX, AND IN ALL OF THE -- AND OUR POLICE DEPARTMENT TO DO EXACTLY THAT. ANYWAY, I THINK I SPEAK FOR THE ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE IN SAYING WE ARE VERY HOPEFUL. ALL OF COUNCIL SHARES OUR DESIRE TO POSITIVELY MOVE FORWARD AND WE'LL REVIEW THIS -- AND WE'LL VIEW THIS RESOLUTION IN THAT SPIRIT AND SUPPORT IT UNANIMOUSLY TONIGHT. THANK YOU.
01:45:12.113: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER?
01:45:12.980: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I FULLY SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION, JUST AS I FULLY SUPPORTED THE HIRING OF CHIEF COX. I STAND BEHIND MY HIRING DECISION. I HAD AN EXCELLENT EXPERIENCE WITH MR. COX, SINCE I HAVE BEEN HERE AND SINCE HE'S BEEN HERE. AND I JUST -- AND I'M GLAD TO HEAR HE'S WILLING TO COME BACK AND SERVE. I THINK HE'S DOING THE RIGHT THINGS. HE'S MEETING WITH EVERY MONTH. I LOVE THE FACT THAT HE MEETS WITH EACH PAIR OF YOUR WARD REPS WHICH LETS US SHARE NOT ONLY WHAT THE COMMUNITY HAS ASKED FOR -- AND PEOPLE COME UP TO US ALL THE TIME, TELL THIS PERSON UP, AND TELL THAT PERSON THAT. HE'S GIVING US THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT. AND HE'S ALSO BRINGING THIS TYPE OF COMMUNITY POLICING THAT WE WANT HERE IN ANN ARBOR AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS HE WAS SUCH A GREAT CANDIDATE AND SO I'M FULLY SUPPORTIVE OF THAT. AND I ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE LOTS OF FOLKS HERE IN THE AWENCE WHO ARE VERY INTERESTED IN -- AUDIENCE WHO ARE VERY INTERESTED IN WHAT HAS HAPPENED HERE. AND I THINK IF IT WAS SET UP IN A CERTAIN WAY WOULD BE MOST INTERESTED IN SPEAKING TO THIS MATTER AND I DON'T KNOW HOW I WOULD MOVE TO ALLOW THAT, BUT I WOULD CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE THE FACT THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE MORE TO SAY ABOUT IT THAN ME. I HAVE HAD A GOOD EXPERIENCE WITH THE CHIEF, I WILL SUPPORT HIS REINSTATEMENT, AND I DON'T KNOW IF I WOULD ASK A PARLIAMENTARIAN OR WHAT THE OPINION ON THAT WOULD BE. I KNOW THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WOULD LOVE TO SPEAK AND THEY CAN WAIT UNTIL END BUT WE DO HAVE A CLOSED SESSION. I WANTED TO THOUGH THAT OUT THERE, THAT I RECOGNIZE THERE ARE PEOPLE WITH SPEAK.
01:46:42.036: >> Mayor Taylor: GUESS WITH ACQUIESCENCE, WE WILL MOVE PUBLIC COMMENT BEFORE CLOSED SESSION? DOES ANYONE CARE ABOUT THAT? PERFECT.
01:46:50.044: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR.
01:46:51.679: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI?
01:46:57.184: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I WELCOME THIS NEWS AND I WELCOME THE CHIEF BACK TO WORK TODAY. NOT PERSONALLY, BUT HERE ON TAPE, I GUESS. I DO WANT TO MOVE ON AND I DO WANT TO PRESS FORWARD. IT'S BEEN A CHALLENGING FEW WEEKS. BUT I HOPE THE PERSON THAT WE HIRED HAS THE CHARACTER THAT WE THINK HE HAS IN ORDER TO PERSEVERE AND GET THROUGH THIS AND LEARN FROM THIS, ALL OF US. AND WE MOVE FORWARD TOGETHER. I'M GRATEFUL THAT WE HAVE A POLICE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION RIGHT NOW THAT CAN EXAMINE THIS AND GET THE COMMUNITY MORE INFORMATION AS TIME COMES. I KNOW PEOPLE ARE EAGER TO GET INFORMATION NOW, BUT THE FACTS ARE GOING TO BE THE SAME. THE OUTCOME IS GOING TO BE THE SAME. SO WHETHER IT COMES OUT NOW OR IN A WEEK OR TWO WEEKS FROM NOW, IS NOT GOING TO BE CHANGE THE FACTS. WE JUST NEED TO BE PATIENT, YOU KNOW, AND WHEN THE POLICE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION CAN REVIEW IT, IF THEY WOULD LIKE TO AND AREAS CAN VIEW DOCUMENTS THAT WE PUBLICLY RELEASED, PEOPLE CAN COME TO THEIR OWN CONCLUSIONS AS TO WHY THINGS TRANSPIRED, BUT I'M JUST HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN MOVE FORWARD, AGAIN, WE DON'T -- WE HAVE TO LEARN FROM THIS, THOUGH. THERE ARE THINGS THAT WE MUST THAT I AWAY FROM IT, AND IT'S NOT JUST MOVE ON AND -- AND NOTHING TO SEE HERE KIND OF THING. IT NEEDS TO BE EXAMINED AND SOMETHING NEEDS TO CHANGE AS A RESULT OF IT ALL, IN A POSITIVE DIRECTION. SO I WILL JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT. I WILL LOOK FORWARD TO OUR MONTHLY MEETINGS WITH CHIEF COX AND CONTINUE TO DEVELOP THAT RELATIONSHIP AND WORK ON THE TRUST THAT WE HAD AND CONTINUE TO BUILD THE TRUST. I KNOW TRUST HAS BEEN SHAKEN, BUT I STILL, AND THIS COUNCIL STILL HAS TRUST IN THE CHIEF, AND IT'S REPRESENTATIVE IN THIS RESOLUTION. AND IT'S REPRESENTATIVE IN THE FACT THAT WE URGED HIS DATE TO COME BACK TO WORK AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND AS WE MOVE FORWARD, WE GET BETTER.
01:49:30.204: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
01:49:34.441: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I HAD A NUMBER OPPORTUNITIES TO TALK TO THE POLICE CHIEF. I KNOW HE HAS AN M.B. A. AND I FELT HE WAS A KINDRED SPIRIT WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT CONTINUOUS QUALITY IMPROVEMENT AND DATA-DRIVEN DECISION MAKING. I HAD COMPLETE CONFIDENCE IN HIM. WHAT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME, WHEN A STAFF MEMBER DESCRIBED HIM AS SOMEBODY WHO ENCOURAGES PEOPLE. SO HE DIDN'T MANAGE PEOPLE. HE DIDN'T SET GOALS. HE ENCOURAGED THEM. AND I THINK THAT SORT OF SUMS UP HIS -- HIS STYLE, AND SO I'M VERY CONFIDENT THAT HE WILL BE ABLE TO BRING ABOUT POSITIVE CHANGES TO THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AND TO OUR COMMUNITY.
01:50:19.219: >> FURTHER DISCUSSION?
01:50:24.391: >> Mayor Taylor: SO THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE ANN ARBOR POLICE DEPARTMENT COME TO WORK EVERY DAY, AND THEY COME TO WORK FOR ONE PURPOSE, AND THAT IS TO PROTECT AND SERVE THE COMMUNITY. THEY ARE DEVOTED TO THIS TASK, AND THEY ARE ENTIRELY COMMITTED TO PERFORM THEIR IMPORTANT, DANGEROUS, AND DIFFICULT WORK WITH DISCIPLINE, AND PROFESSIONALISM. AND AS A RESULT, THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE ANN ARBOR POLICE DEPARTMENT ARE HELD AND THEY HOLD THEMSELVES TO THE HIGHEST OF STANDARDS. THIS GOES FROM YESTERDAY'S HIRE TO THE CHIEF OF POLICE. THESES STANDARDS, THEY ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN ANY OF US. THEY ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN ANY INDIVIDUAL IN THE POLICE DEPARTMENT BECAUSE IT IS UPON OUR ADHERENCE TO THESE STANDARDS, NOT UPON THE STRENGTH OF ANY INDIVIDUAL THAT TRUST PROPERLY RESTS. ON FEBRUARY 7th, 2020, THE ADMINISTRATOR PLACED THE CHIEF ON ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE. HE DID THIS TO ALLOW FOR THE SWIFT AND FAIR INQUIRY INTO CHIEF'S ACTIONS WITH REGARD TO TWO THINGS, ONE, AN INTERNAL AFFAIRS INVESTIGATION RELATED TO IMPROPER PARKING TICKET CLEARANCE. TWO, A CLIMATE IN WHICH SUBORDINATES FEARED RETALIATION. THESE ARE FACTS ESTABLISHED AND FOUND IN THE NORRIS REPORT. THESE CONCERNS WERE RAISED BY THE POLICE DEPARTMENT COMMAND STAFF OVER TIME THROUGH PROPER CHANNELS. THAT IS TO SAY HUMAN RESOURCES AND ULTIMATELY TO THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR. LIKE THE REST OF CITY COUNCIL, I LEARNED ABOUT THESE MATTERS ONLY AFTER THE CHIEF HAD BEEN PLACED UPON LEAVE. THE REPORT, THE RESULTS OF THIS REPORT, THE INVESTIGATOR'S REPORT IS SOBERING. THE INTEGRITY OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS IS SAK SACROSANCT. AND THE RIGHT TO BE FREE FROM FEAR OF RETALIATION IS BEDROCK. THE REPORT FINDS THAT THE CHIEF DID NOT INTEND TO VIOLATE ANY OF THESE PRINCIPLES. BUT THE REPORT ALSO FINDS THAT THE COMMAND STAFF HAD LEGITIMATE REASONS TO CONCLUDE OTHERWISE. THIS IS A WIDE DISCONNECT, AND IT DEMONSTRATES SERIOUS COMMUNICATION PROBLEMS. THE CHIEF IN HIS RESPONSE DOES NOT CHALLENGE MANY OF THE REPORTS' PARTICULARS. IN INDEED IN HIS OWN WORDS, HE TAKES COMPLETE OWNERSHIP FOR THE BREAKDOWN IN COMMUNICATION, THAT CREATES, ONE, THE IMPRESSION THAT HE INTENDED TO INKNEWENCE THE RESULTS OF AN INVESTIGATION -- INFLUENCE THE RESULTS OF AN INVESTIGATION AND TWO, THE ATMOSPHERE IN WHICH THE SUBORDINATE FELT VULNERABLE. REGARDING THE REPORT'S FINDINGS THAT HE WAS INSUBORDINATE, HE PROVIDED IMPORTANT RELEVANT CONTEST. FINALLY AND IMPORTANTLY IN THE CHIEF'S REPORT IN HIS OWN WORDS HE APOLOGIZED TO THE SUBORDINATE FOR UNINTENTIONALLY CREATING THE MISUNDERSTANDING, AFFIRMED THE RIGHT TO BE FREE OF RETALIATION. AFTER READING THE REPORT, AND THE CHIEF'S RESPONSE, I TOO THINK IT WAS AN ISSUE OF COMMUNICATION AND NOT AN ISSUE OF VALUES. I WELCOME HIS RETURN TO, WOULD. I CONTINUE TO BE PROUD OF OUR POLICE DEPARTMENT, UP AND DOWN THE LINE. WITH RESPECT TO OUR CHIEF, I HAVE RENEWED GRATITUDE FOR HIS THOUGHTFULNESS, HIS SINCERITY, HIS DEEP COMMITMENT TO COMMUNICATE, TO FAIRNESS, AND TO PRINCIPLED POLICING. AND TO IMPROVING THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. I ALSO HAVE GREAT ADMIRATION FOR COMMAND STAFF. THESE MEN AND WOMEN, THEY CAME FORWARD AT SUBSTANTIAL PROFESSIONAL RISK TO ENSURE THAT THE SYSTEM WORKED. TO ENSURE THAT AN INTERNAL INVESTIGATION AFFAIR WAS ON THE LEVEL -- PARDON ME THAT AN INTERNAL AFFAIRS INVESTIGATION WAS ON THE LEVEL, THAT THEIR WORK PLACE WAS FREE OF RETALIATION. THEY COULD HAVE LOOKED THE ERR WAY, BUT THEY DIDN'T. FOR THEM, DOING THE POLICE -- DOING THE JOB OF POLICE WITH HONOR IS TOO IMPORTANT. MOVING FORWARD, AFTER THIS, AS I HOPE WE ALL DO AND AS I KNOW WE ALL WILL, I HOPE AND I BELIEVE THAT ALL IN THE POLICE DEPARTMENT, CHIEF, COMMAND STAFF, PATROL OFFICERS THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO WALK THE PATH TOGETHER WITH THEIR HEADS HELD HIGH. A GOOD LEADER OWNS MISTAKES AND LEARNS FROM THEM. CHIEF COX CARES DEEPLY ABOUT POLICING. HE CARES DEEPLY ABOUT THE POLICE DEPARTMENT. HE CARES DEEPLY ABOUT THE COMMUNITY. HE HAS APOLOGIZED, AND HE HAS COMMITTED TO CREATE A CANDID IT AND MORE COMMUNICATIVE WORKPLACE AND I BELIEVE HE CAN DO THESE THINGS AND I BELIEVE THE POLICE DEPARTMENT WILL WORK WITH HIM. I LOOK FORWARD TO HIS LEADERSHIP OF YOU ARE EXEMPLARY POLICE DEPARTMENT FOR I BELIEVE THAT HE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL. FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES]
01:55:18.151: >> OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. DB-1, RESOLUTION TO APPROVE THE STANDARD AT ANN ARBOR SITE PLAN AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT AT 405 SOUTH MAIN STREET. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRAND. SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM. DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
01:55:39.072: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I WILL KICK IT OFF, I GUESS. WE HAVE A SITE PLAN IN FRONT OF US THAT I WILL BE SUPPORTING TO THE CHAGRIN OF SOME FOLKS THAT HAVE EMAILED ME. I DON'T SEE ANYTHING HERE THAT WOULD KIND OF MAKE ME OBJECT TO THE POINT OF DENYING THE SITE PLAN. IT'S THE DEVELOPERS AND THE ARCHITECT HAVE DONE AN EXCELLENT JOB IN WORKING IN THE SYSTEM AND ENGAGED IN THE COMMUNITY. FILLING THE REQUIREMENTS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE PREMIUMS THAT WE OFFER, BUT I WILL SAY THAT I'M DISAPPOINTED IN THIS PRO E JECT BECAUSE IT REALLY DOESN'T EXCITE -- PROJECT BECAUSE IT REALLY DOESN'T EXCITE ME SO MUCH WHEN IT COMES TO THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING ASPECTS AND IT DOESN'T EXCITE ME WHEN ITS TO THE CLIMATE ACTION GOALS WE HAVE. YOU KNOW, WE'RE TEARING DOWN A BUILDING THAT IS YOUNGER THAN I AM. THE BUILDING THAT WILL BE TORN DOWN IS ONLY 40 YEARS OLD. IT ACTUALLY WOP AN AWARD WHEN IT WAS BUILT -- WON AN AWARD WHEN IT WAS BUILT. WE HEAR ABOUT THE RESOURCES THAT WE ARE CONSUMING AT AN ASTRONOMICAL SPEED BECAUSE WE GET A DISPOSABLE SOCIETY. WE BUILD THINGS AND WE TEAR THEM DOWN IN 30 YEARS. AND THIS NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE US DO A LOT LESS OF THAT, AND IN IN THIS CASE, BE TEARING DOWN A BUILDING TO PUT SOMETHING ELSE THERE. AND WITH WHAT'S GOING TO BE PUT THERE IS OBVIOUSLY, GOING TO PROVIDE US WITH MORE HOUSING IN DOWNTOWN THAT WILL BE LESS DEPENDING ON AUTOMOBILES, BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THIS DEVELOPMENT, IT'S JUST WOEFUL. 1% OF SOLAR PRODUCTION. WE HAVE, YOU KNOW -- WE HAVE NOT TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF ANY RENEWABLE RESOURCES. WE ARE -- WE HAVE HEATED PATIOS FOR THE POOL, GAS BEING BURNED FOR AESTHETICS. IT'S JUST DECADENCE AT THE EXPENSE OF THE ENVIRONMENT, AND AS WE BUILD AND DESIGN BUILDINGS IN THE FUTURE, THAT WE EMBED OUR VALUES IN THE CLIMATE EMERGENCY THAT WE JUST DECLARED AND TO THE PROJECTS WE BUILD, THAT THEY ARE MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE AND MORE RESPONSIBLE, AND THAT'S MY ONLY COMPLAINT ABOUT THIS DEVELOPMENT. IT'S JUST IT FALLED SHORT TO THE KIND OF BUILDING I WOULD LIKE TO SEE BUILT IN ANN ARBOR IN 2020.
01:58:42.856: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER LUMM?
01:58:44.925: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I HAVE MIXED FEELINGS ON THIS ONE. AND OBVIOUSLY SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES, COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI SHARES SOME OF MY CONCERNS. I DID ASK WHAT F.A.R. WOULD REVEAL OUT UNDER OUR NEW PREMIUM RULES AND THE ANSWER IS 250%. THIS PROPOSAL IS 400%. THIS IN AND OF ITSELF SUGGESTS THE PROJECT COULD BE IMPROVED WITH MORE THAN TWO AFFORDABLE UNITS. I RECOGNIZE AND I AGREE THAT SINCE THE PROPOSAL WAS SUBMITTED UNDER THE OLD RULES, THAT'S WHAT SHOULD BE THE GUIDING DECISION. YOU KNOW, I'M -- I DON'T SUPPORT CHANGING THE RULES DURING THE GAME. BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT WE SHOULD NOT WORK HARDER TO IMPROVE THE PROJECT SO THAT IT WOULD MEET OR GET CLOSER TO MEETING THE EXPECTATIONS OF THE NEW PREMIUM RULES. AND SO I ASKED ABOUT PARKING AND ALTHOUGH I KNOW STAFF LIKELY WON'T AGREE, I DON'T THINK 102 SPACES WILL MEET THE DEMAND GENERATED FROM 421 BEDROOMS. IF I'M RIGHT, WE KNOW THE RESULT. THE VEHICLES PARKED IN ADJACENT NEIGHBORHOODS. WE HAVE SEEN THAT WITH COUNTLESS OTHER PROJECTS. AND MY FINAL CONCERN IS WITH THE TRAFFIC AND SPECIFICALLY THE ACCESS TO THE BUILDING FROM THE ALLEY. WE HEARD FROM MR. McKEY TONIGHT. HE WROTE US ALL, AS HE INDICATED WHEN HE SPOKE DURING THE HEARING, AND I SHARE THAT CONCERN THAT THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL -- IT SOUNDS LIKE TO BE VERY PROBLEMATIC FOR THE ADJACENT RESIDENTS WHO HAVE THAT AS THEIR ACCESS TO THEIR HOMES. I'M HOPING MR. KHAN CAN SPEAK TO US ON THAT. IT CAME UP AT THE PLANNING COMMISSION. AND APPARENTLY ALL THE RESIDENTS, IT WILL BE DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY THIS AND IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THIS WAS ADDRESSED IN A WAY THAT WOULD SATISFY THEIR CONCERNS. I KNOW THERE'S SOME QUESTION ABOUT THE WIDTH OF THE ALLEY, AND IT WAS NOTED THAT THE ALLEY ON THE WILLIAMS STREET SIDE, FOR EXAMPLE IS 10 FEET AND THE TRAFFIC STUDY APPARENTLY DOES NOT ADDRESS MR. MIEFSKI DID SPEAK TO THIS. SO ANYWAY, MR. KHAN, IF YOU CAN SPEAK TO THAT. BECAUSE, AGAIN, IT DOES SOUND PROBLEMATIC AND THOSE ARE MY CONCERNS AND I DO RECOGNIZE THE BENEFITS OF THE PROJECTS IN TERMS OF ADDING 218 RESIDENTIAL UNITS AND A LOCATION THAT'S DOWNTOWN AND CLOSE TO TRANSIT. I AM INCLINED TO SUPPORT THIS, AND I'M INTERESTED IN FINDING OUT WHAT MY OTHER COLLEAGUES SAY TO THIS. IF YOU CAN SPEAK TO THE ISSUE OF ACCESS FROM THE ALLEY. AND MR. KHAN, I APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE. AND THE OTHER ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION, SPECIFICALLY -- AND, AGAIN, YOU KNOW, THIS -- THIS MEETS THE RULES THAT WERE IN PLACE FOR THIS PROJECT, BUT IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT THE PROPOSAL COULD HAVE BEEN MODIFIED TO HAVE MORE SOLAR PANELS AND THE CONCERN THAT THERE ARE JUST TWO AFFORDABLE UNITS AND THE LEED STANDARD. SO THANK YOU.
02:02:27.147: >> THANK YOU. MR. MAYOR, MEMBERS OF COUNCIL, MY NAME IS JEFF CAAN, I'M THE PLANNER WHO WORKED ON THIS PROJECT. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS. WITH REGARD TO THE ALLEY SITUATION, THE -- THE RIGHT-OF-WAY OF THE ALLEY IS 16 FEET IN WIDTH FROM WILLIAM ALL THE WAY DOWN TO PACKARD. RIGHT NOW, THERE ARE SECTIONS THAT ARE -- THAT FEEL NARROWER, AND SO I DO UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN, BUT 16 FEET DOES EXIST. IT'S A CITY-OWNED ALLEY. WE OWN THE RIGHT-OF-WAY. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE DEVELOPER TO ENSURE THAT DROPOFFS AND PICKUPS AND DELIVERIES ARE FOCUSED ON THE ALLEY. WE RECOGNIZE THAT MULTIPLE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS SCATTERED AROUND DOWNTOWN DON'T HAVE THE BENEFIT OF HAVING AN ALLEY IMMEDIATELY ADJACENT TO THEM AND SO YOU HAVE DELIVERY TRUCKS STOPPING IN HURON AND CREATING BOTTLENECKS AND REAL PROBLEMS AND PEOPLE PARKING IN PLACES WHERE THEY REALLY SHOULDN'T. SO WE REALLY DON'T WANT TO EMBRACE THE FACT THAT THERE'S AN ALLEY HERE. THE DEVELOPER HAS IDENTIFIED SPACES ON THEIR SITE, WHERE UBER AND LYFT DROPOFFS COULD TAKE PLACE AND MAYBE OTHER DELIVERY. WE BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE MOVED IN THAT DIRECTION. I ALSO WANTED TO INVITE YOU TO FURTHER DELVE INTO THE TRAFFIC ISSUES MORE WITH THE PETITIONER'S AGENT, G SCOTT BETZEL. HIS FIRM DID THE TRAFFIC STUDY. IF YOU HAVE ANY SPECIFIC CONCERNS ABOUT THAT, I'M SURE HE WOULD BE HAPPY TO TRY TO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS. WITH REGARD TO THE 421 BEDROOMS HERE, IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT MOST OF THE UNITS WILL BE MARKETED TOWARDS STUDENTS AND YOUNG PROFESSIONALS. WE ARE FINDING FEWER AND FEWER STUDENTS BRINGING VEHICLES TO SCHOOL, PARTICULARLY IF THEY ARE IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO CAMPUS, AND OTHER AMENITIES. AND SO WE BELIEVE THAT IN ADDITION TO THAT, STUDENTS HAVE HOURS THAT ARE DIFFERENT THAN THE PEAK PERIODS, MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY. PEAK PERIODS MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY, 7:30 A.M. TO 8:30 A.M., AND 4:30 TO 5:30, THE STUDENTS WILL BE MOVING AT A DIFFERENT TIME GENERALLY THAN THAT. PROBABLY NOT GETTING OUT BETWEEN 7:30 AND 8:30 AS MUCH. MY GUESS IS MOST WILL WALK OR TAKE A BIKE TO CAMPUS. AS YOU KNOW, THE CITY COMPLETED ITS DUAL BIKE LANE ALONG WILLIAM, WHICH COULD ALLOW PEOPLE FAIRLY CONVENIENT AND SAFE ACCESS DIRECTLY TO CENTRAL CAMPUS. WITH REGARD TO YOUR OTHER QUESTIONS, IF YOU WANT TO LEAVE ME WITH THOSE.
02:05:13.346: >> Councilmember Lumm: AT FORWARDABLE HOUSING.
02:05:14.480: >> AS YOU KNOW, WE ARE USING THE OLD STANDARDS AND THE PETITIONER IS PROPOSING TO HAVE TWO AFFORDABLE UNITS TO TRY TO CAPTURE A LITTLE BIT MORE SQUARE FOOTAGE. THE ISSUE DID COME UP WITH REGARD TO CREATING SMALLER UNITS. THE PETITIONER IS PROVIDING MOST OF THESE UNITS AS STUDIOS, ONES AND TWOS AND THERE ARE A FEW THREES AND A FEW MORE FOURS BUT MOST OF THE UNITS ARE GOING TO BE AT THAT SMALLER END, WHICH MAY NOT SOUND AFFORDABLE, BUT IN TERMS OF MARKET RATE, IT WILL PROBABLY BE A LITTLE BIT MORE AFFORDABLE THAN A LARGER UNIT. AND THEN YOU HAD A QUESTION ABOUT SOLAR. WE HAVE BEEN ASKING THE PETITIONER TO CONSIDER PROVIDING MORE SOLAR ON THE ROOF. WHAT WE DID GET WAS AI COMMITMENT FOR THE PETITIONER TO CREATE SOLAR READY ROOFS, BOTH OF THE ROOFS WILL BE SOLAR READY TO ACCOMMODATE FUTURE SOLAR PANELS, IF SO DESIRED. WE DID GET THE PETITIONER TO AGREE TO PROVIDE APPROXIMATELY 1250 SQUARE FEET ON THE TOWER PORTION. IN ADDITION, WE ARE INTERNALLY MOVING TO AMEND OUR CODE SECTION TO EXEMPT SOLAR PANELS FROM TRIGGERING OUR HEIGHT LIMITATION. THAT WAS A CONCERN WITH THE LOWER PORTION OF THIS BUILDING AND WE HAVE A STAFF MEMBER THAT IS CURRENTLY WORKING ON THAT AND HOPEFULLY YOU WILL SEE THAT SOMETIME IN THE NEAR FUTURE. LET ME PAUSE TO SEE IF SCOTT BETZEL HAD ANYTHING TO ADD WITH REGARD TO YOUR QUESTIONS ON TRAFFIC AND ACCESS.
02:06:50.209: >> Councilmember Lumm: THANK YOU, MR. KHAN.
02:06:56.816: >> GOOD EVENING, MY NAME IS SCOTT BETZEL. I'M WITH MIDWEST. WE PREPARED SITE PLAN, AS WELL AS DID THE TRAFFIC STUDY. I WANTED TO JUST START OUT BY SAYING THAT WE DIDN'T DEVELOP THIS ACCESS LOCATION OFFER OF THE ALLEY IN A VACUUM. IT WAS A COLLABORATIVE PROCESS, BETWEEN THE CITY, CITY STAFF, AND THE CITY'S CONSULTING TRAFFIC ENGINEER. WHO ALL REVIEWED THE TRAFFIC STUDY AND THE METRICS THAT WERE IN THERE, THE TRIP DISTRIBUTION, AND THE PEAK HOUR TRAFFIC GENERATION AND ALL, AND AGREED TO WHAT WE FOUND IN THE TRAFFIC STUDY. INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH, AS JEFF ALLUDED TO, AS PART OF THIS TRAFFIC STUDY, WE DID A STUDY OF THE 615 SOUTH MAIN BUILDING, WHICH YOU GUYS ARE FAMILIAR WITH, THE YARD, IT'S CALLED NOW. IT'S BIGGER. IT HAS 550 SOME BEDROOMS. 140 SPACES, AND UNDERGROUND PARKING. AS OF THE SPRING, THEY HAD NOT EVEN LEASED ALL OF THE SPACES IN THE BUILDING. WE PUT CAMERAS OUT THERE, AND WE MONITORED THE MORNING PEAK HOUR TRAFFIC AND THE AFTERNOON PEAK HOUR TRAFFIC. IN THE MORNING, THEY GENERATED NINE TRIPS, THAT WAS ALL THAT CAME OUT OF THERE AND IN THE AFTERNOON, IT WAS LIKE 17. SO IN THE PEAK HOUR, LET ME JUST SAY. THE 7:30 TO 8:30 RANGE AND THE 4 TO 5:00 RANGE. SO THESE DEVELOPMENTS ARE NOT GENERATING THE TRAFFIC THAT A TRADITIONAL USE WOULD. NOW, THIS BUILDING AS IT STANDS TODAY AND HAS BEEN USED IN THE PAST, EMPLOYED ABOUT 160 PEOPLE. WHILE THEY ONLY HAD 41 PARKING SPACES ON SITE, THERE WAS STILL PROBABLY 160 CARS COMING TO THAT AREA. NOW, EVERY DAY, YOU COULD IMAGINE THAT THAT PARKING LOT WAS ABSOLUTELY FULL. SO THIS WAS AT LEAST 40 TRIPS IN AND OUT OF THE ALLEY AND MAIN STREET, AS WELL. WE DO ADMIT THAT THERE WAS OBVIOUSLY A MAIN STREET EXIT BUT I COULDN'T TELL YOU, TO BE HONEST, WHAT WAS USED THE ALLEY OR MAIN STREET AND TO SAY THAT MAYBE SMAIN STREET WAS USED MOR, I THINK IS A LITTLE MORE MISLEADING. I WOULD SUSPECT IT'S PRETTY EQUAL. AT ANY RATE, IT'S CLEAR AND IT WAS CLEAR TO THE CITY STAFF, AND THE CITY'S PAID TRAFFIC CONSULTANT AND OUR TRAFFIC CONSULTANT THAT THE PEAK HOUR GENERATION IS NOT GOING TO BE AS HIGH WITH THIS PROPOSAL AS IT WAS WHEN THIS WAS AN OFFICE BUILDING AND PEOPLE WERE COMING IN AT 7:30, 8:00 EVERY DAY AND LEAVING AT 4:30, 5:00 EVERY DAY IN A RUSH. NOT A RUSH, LITERALLY, BUT LIKE IN A CONFINED PERIOD. SO WE ARE VERY COMFORTABLE WITH THE TRAFFIC STUDY. I THINK EVERYBODY WAS APPEASED BY IT.
02:09:43.349: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD?
02:09:47.920: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I JUST WONDER WE ARE BG SOMEONE ON AN ALLEY. I LOOKED UP THE DEFINITION OF AN ALLEY. A NARROW PASSAGE WAY BETWEEN OR BEHIND BUILDINGS. ARE WE GOING TO CREATE A STREET BACK THERE H OR LEAVE IT JUST AN ALLEY.
02:10:11.844: >> IT'S TECHNICALLY AN ALLEY. AND IT'S NOT TECHNICALLY A STREET. I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE DEFINITION BETWEEN STREET AND ALLEY COME FROM, BUT I SUSPECT IT PROBABLY HAS TO DO WITH THE WIDTH OF THE RIGHT-OF-WAY THAT WAS DEDICATED.
02:10:28.895: >> Councilmember Griswold: OKAY. I'M CONCERNED THAT WE ARE STARTING A NEW STANDARD AND ALLEY IS DEFINITELY A STREET. THERE WILL BE NO DRIVEWAYS, EGRESS TO THE BUILDING. AND I'M NOT AS CONCERNED ABOUT THE TRAFFIC COMING IN AND OUT OF THE BUILDING DURING PEAK TIMES. I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT DROPOFF AND PICKUP ON MAIN STREET AND PACKARD AND WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO CONTROL THAT ON HURON. ARE WE GOING TO -- IF WE WERE TO SAY IT WILL BE STRICTLY ENFORCED NO STOPPING ON MAIN STREET AND ON PACKARD, WILL THE TRAFFIC PATTERN BE ACCOMMODATED IN THE ALLEY?
02:11:10.469: >> I GUESS I CAN'T ANSWER THAT IN ALL CERTAINLY, BUT I GUESS IN THE SITUATION THAT YOU ARE CITING, IS THERE AN ALLEY AVAILABLE FOR PEOPLE?
02:11:18.711: >> Councilmember Griswold: WELL, I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE THE BEER TRUCK COULD BE IN THERE UNLOADING.
02:11:23.916: >> YOU MENTIONED ON HURON STREET.
02:11:25.718: >> Councilmember Griswold:  ON HURON, IT'S BEEN A MAJOR PROBLEM AND --
02:11:28.487: >> PEOPLE ARE STOPPING ON A STATE HIGHWAY?
02:11:32.024: >> YEAH.
02:11:32.291: >> Councilmember Griswold: YEAH, ALL THE TIME! AND I WANT TO -- AS A COUNCILMEMBER, I WANT TO -- IF A I CAN'T PREVENT THAT FROM HAPPENING BECAUSE THAT BUILDING WAS BUILT BEFORE I WAS COUNCIL. I DON'T WANT TO APPROVE A BUILDING THAT INTHE REAR-END COLLISIONS.
02:11:52.078: >> THERE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY WHERE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE VISITING THIS PLACE ON HURON STREET CAN STOP SUCH AS AN ALLEY?
02:12:02.088: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES, BUT THEY HAVE LARGE DUMPSTERS BACK THERE. THEY DIDN'T PLAN FOR THIS. THEY DIDN'T PLAN FOR UBER AND LYFT.
02:12:15.801: >> WE HAVE A DROPOFF AREA AND WE HAVE A LOADING AND UNLOADING ZONE AS WELL. THE DROPOFF FOR RIDESHARE, IT'S A REALITY TODAY. I MEAN, IT'S JUST -- IT'S HERE TO STAY. SO IT'S AS BIG OF A REALITY AS -- WHEN YOU DO A BUILDING LIKE, THIS YOU HAVE TO HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL PACKAGE ROOM WHICH WAS THE THING THAT NEVER WAS A FACTOR TEN YEARS AGO. BECAUSE OF ALL THE DELIVERY. SO IT'S SOMETHING WE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT.
02:12:42.561: >> Councilmember Griswold: I'M GLAD YOU ARE PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE IN THOSE AREAS.
02:12:45.665: >> WHO KNOWS WHAT THE FUTURE WILL HOLD.
02:12:47.500: >> IF YOU DON'T MIND, I WOULD ADD THAT, YES, WE DEFINITELY TOOK THAT INTO CONSIDERATION. AND I THINK THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT THE ALLEY OFFERS UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY FOR TWO FLOWS, TWO DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS FOR TRAFFIC, FROM WILLIAMS OR FROM PACKARD. SO IF ONE WERE TO BE BLOCKED, THAT WOULD BE MAINTAINED AND WATCHED BY OUR BUILDING AS WELL. WE WOULD BE A PARTICIPANT TO MAKE SURE THE TRAFFIC IS MOVING CLEANLY. AND I DID WANT TO CLEARLY SAY THAT WE DO HAVE A LOADING AREA ALSO FOR TRASH. SO WE ARE PROVIDING ALL OF THESE AREAS FOR LOADING, FOR TRASH, SEPARATE LOADING AREA FOR UPS, POSTAL SERVICE, ANYBODY WHO WANTS TO STOP THIS, AMAZON AND THEN HAVING THE ABILITY TO HAVE RIDESHARE THERE. I THINK LONG-TERM, THE GOAL WITH THE CITY QUITE OFTEN IS USUALLY NOT TO PUT ACCESS ON A PUBLIC STREET. THERE'S JUST NOT ENOUGH WIDTH FROM THE CORNER FROM WILLIAMS TO THE ALLEY. SO TRADITIONALLY, YOU WOULDN'T SEE IT THERE AND YOU CERTAINLY WOULDN'T SEE IT ALONG PACKARD. IT'S JUST TOO MUCH TRAFFIC AT THAT AREA.
02:13:43.956: >> Councilmember Griswold: RIGHT.
02:13:45.291: >> AND I THINK IT WOULD BE SHORT SIGHTED FOR THE CITY NOT TO CONSIDER THE FUTURE OF WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN TO MAIN STREET AS IT DEVELOPS FURTHER AND FURTHER SOUTH AS A STRONGER PEDESTRIAN. AND SO IT'S AN IDEAL SCENARIO THAT I CAN ACTUALLY HAVE THE TRAFFIC WORK OFF THE ALLEY.
02:14:01.974: >> Councilmember Griswold: THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE ALL THE COMMUNICATE ENGAGEMENT. I DID ATTEND SOME OF THE SESSIONS.
02:14:09.048: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
02:14:10.816: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. MY ONLY COMMENT ON THE ALLY IS A 16-FOOT ALLEY IS BASICALLY THE LENGTH OF AN AVERAGE VEHICLE. YOU GET MORE OR LESS. AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE -- I'M TRYING TO PUT MY COLLEGE DEGREE TO GOOD USE HERE. IF YOU LOOK AT THESE PLANS, THEY HAVE PARKING THAT IS PERPENDICULAR TO THE ALLEY. IT'S A TIGHT SQUEEZE. IT'S LIKE ALL THE OTHER DOWNTOWN ALLEYS. HAVE A COUPLE OF OTHER CONCERNS. I WOULD LIKE US AS A BODY TO REDEFINE AND SETTLE ON A DEFINITION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING BECAUSE 80% OF A.M.I. IS NOT AFFORDABLE. THAT'S A STUDIO APARTMENT FOR $1,650. THAT'S STOP CALLING IT AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IT'S NEAR MARKET RATE HOUSING. MAYBE WORKFORCE HOUSING. AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS 60 AND BELOW. WE HAVE TO GET OUR LANGUAGE. WE KNEE LOW-INCOME AND MIDDLE HOUSING IN THIS TOWN. 80% A.M.I. IS NOT AFFORDABLE. ASK JENNIFER HALL. I THINK WE NEED TO CHANGE THE LANGUAGE AROUND THIS CONVERSATION SO WE REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT WE ARE GETTING. OKAY. SO 413 BEDROOMS. THE CITY ONLY REQUIRES 42 PARKING SPACES BUT WE HAVE 102 AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING ELSE I WANT US TO LOOK AT AS A BODY. YOU KNOW, I WISH COUNCILMEMBER SMITH WAS HERE. I'M SORRY HE'S ILL BECAUSE I BELIEVE HE AND I SEE HIGH-TO-EYE ON THIS. -- EYE-TO-EYE ON THIS. THAT WE NEED MAXES IF WE ARE REALLY SERIOUS ABOUT OUR CLIMATE AND GETTING PEOPLE TO NOT HAVE VEHICLES DOWNTOWN. SO I KNOW YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST TENANT TYPE AND SO THE ARGUMENT THAT ALWAYS HAPPENS IS THESE ARE GOING TO BE PEOPLE WHO LIVE AND WORK IN THE AREA AND THAT'S WHY WE ARE BUILDING HOUSING IN OUR DOWNTOWN. BUT WE CANNOT DISCRIMINATE THAT WAY. WE CAN'T ASK THESE PEOPLE, THE LEASEHOLDER, WE CAN'T SAY, DO YOU BELIEVE AND WORK IN THIS DOWNTOWN? NO. YOU CAN'T LIVE HERE. WE DON'T KNOW THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO LIVE HERE. LIKELY THEY ARE. LIKELY WE ARE APPROVING MORE STUDENT HOUSING HERE AND LETTING THE STUDENTS PUSH FURTHER AND FURTHER DOWN 615, 618 SOUTH MAIN ARE. AND I GUESS THAT'S THE WAY IT'S GOING:  THE PRIVATE SECTOR IS PICKING UP THE SLACK FOR THE UNIVERSITY'S GROWTH AND IT'S UNFORTUNATE THI THAT THEY ARE NT PICKING IT UP IN A WAY TO OUR NEW STANDARDS. I THINK ARE WE GOING TO LEAVE ROOM ON MAIN STREET FOR OUR PEDESTRIAN ACTIVITY, NOT IF THE SETBACKS ARE 3 FEET, 10 FEET AND 1.4 FEET. WHERE'S THE ROOM FOR GROWTH? WHERE'S THE ROOM FOR GROWTH WHEN WE PUT THESE BUILDINGS RIGHT ON THE STREET? RIGHT ON THE SIDEWALK! THESE SETBACKS ARE OUTRAGEOUS TO ME. IT'S A WHOLE PARKING LOT. IT WILL LOOK REAL DIFFERENT. SO I ALSO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE -- YOU KNOW, AS COUNCILMAN RAMLAWI STATED, THIS ISN'T THE TYPE OF BUILDING WE WOULD BUILD EVEN TODAY UNDER OUR NEW RULES, BECAUSE THERE'S SO LITTLE NOD TO AFFORDABLE OR LOW-INCOME HOUSING IN IT, LET ALONE THE BUILDING WE WANT TO SEE IN TEN YEARS, IN 2030, WHEN WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE CARBON NEUTRAL AS A CITY. LEED DOESN'T DO ANYTHING FOR ME. CURRENTLY IT'S SCHEDULED IN HERE THAT THERE'S TWO ELECTRIC VEHICLE SITE AND THERE WILL BE ZERO WHEN THE BUILDING IS BUILT. THAT'S WHEN IT SAYS. NOT LOW EMISSION, BUT ELECTRIC VEHICLE SPOTS. THAT'S A STEP BACKWARDS. THE CONSTRUCTION TYPE IS A STEP BACKWARDS AND I'M SEEING THAT WE HAVE GAS LINES AND GAS APPLIANCES GOING INTO THIS BUILDING. THAT'S A STEP BACKWARDS. I WISH I COULD SAY THIS. THIS IS A KIND OF BUILDING THAT WE USED TO BUILD. THIS IS THE KIND OF BUILDING THAT WE USED TO BUILD. IT'S NOT THE KIND OF BUILDING THAT WE SHOULD BE BUILDING NOW. AND THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THAT. I WON'T SUPPORT THIS.
02:17:51.637: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
02:17:54.740: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  I JUST HAVE A QUESTION ON THE ALLEYS. I KNOW THAT ALL THE OTHER DOWNTOWN ALLEYS ARE ONE WAY. THEY GO NORTH TO SOUTH, I THINK. ON MOST OF THE ALLEYS BETWEEN ASHLEY AND MAIN STREET. NOW WE ARE TALKING ABOUT MAKING THIS A TWO-WAY ALLEY S. THIS THE ONLY TWO-WAY ALLEY IN THE DOWNTOWN?
02:18:24.103: >> THIS IS A TWO-WAY ALLEY. I CAN'T SPEAK TO WHETHER OTHER ALLEYS ARE R ONE-WAY ALLEYS NOR. THE I THIS A FEW ARE. SCOTT, DO YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT? I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER. I KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF TWO-WAY ALLEYS, AND THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHERS. I THINK THE CONCLUSION WE DREW, EVERYONE WAS FOGGY ON IT, BUT ALLEYS NORTH OF HURON RUN SOUTH ONLY. AND ALLEYS SOUTH OF HURON RUN NORTH ONLY. SO EVERYTHING KIND OF GOES TO HURON AS THE MAIN -- IF THEY ARE SIGN AS SUCH. BUT I KNOW THIS IS NOT UNIQUE, THAT THERE ARE OTHER TWO-WAY ALLEYS. IT'S CURRENTLY A TWO-WAY ALLEY. SO NOTHING IS CHANGING.
02:19:23.662: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE FOUNDRY, AND EVERYTHING IS BEING SENT IN A BOX, A CARDBOARD BOX FROM AMAZON, AND I GUESS PILING UP THE RECYCLING COLLECTION POINTS A LOT MORE CARDBOARD COMING IN THESE DAYS FOR SOME REASON. HOW MUCH ROOM IS DEDICATED TO FOLKS WHO DROP THOSE PACKAGES OFF? BECAUSE TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, THEY ARE NOT -- THEY DON'T OBSERVE OUR TRAFFIC LAWS. THEY DON'T OBSERVE SIGNS. THEY JUST PARK WHEREVER THEY WANT TO PARK AND PULL UP ON A SIDEWALK OR DRIVEWAY OR BLOCK HURON. WE DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO ENFORCE THE LAWS. AND HOW MUCH ROO. ROOM IS DEDICATEDFOR THAT PART E DEVELOPMENT? AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT UBER AND LYFT, THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M DESCRIBING. IT'S THE PACKAGES. IT'S THE TRUCKS. S THE UPS, THE AMAZONS. IT'S THOSE THAT MOST OFTEN ARE FLAGRANT OF OUR ORDINANCES.
02:20:38.137: >> THE PACKAGE DELIVERY AREA IS ABOUT 20 FEET WIDE BY 60 FEET LONG. SO DEPENDING ON THE SIZE OF VEHICLE, AT DIFFERENT TIMES IT COULD PROBABLY ACCOMMODATE TWO VEHICLES. IN ADDITION TO THAT WE HAVE OUR TRASH LOADING AREA IF PEOPLE ARE REALLY NOT FOLLOWING THE RULE, WE WILL POST NOT TO PARK THERE BUT THE TRASH IS PICKED UP A COUPLE OF TIMES A WEEK AT A SET SCHEDULE. SO I THINK WE HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF FLEXIBILITY AND WE HAVE LAND BANKED QUITE A BIT OF LAND BACK THERE. IF SOMETHING WAS TO CHANGE IN THE FUTURE OR FOR SOME REASON, WE WOULDN'T LOSE PARKING. WE FAR EXCEED ANYTHING THAT'S REQUIRED BECAUSE ACTUALLY NOTHING IS REQUIRED AND WE THINK WE HAVE A GOOD SETUP HERE TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO SEE TWO TO THREE VEHICLES SHOW UP.
02:21:27.186: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: OKAY. THANK YOU.
02:21:36.662: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
02:21:40.465: >> Councilmember Grand: LOOKING AT THIS PROJECT, I KNOW LEARNING IS AN ITERATE PROCESS. BECAUSE IT DOES TAKE A LONG TIME TO GET A BUILDING TO COME TO TRUEITION. YOU KNOW, A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO WE DIDN'T HAVE THESE DOWNTOWN OVERLAYS AND NOW WE SEE A HIGHER BUILDING WHERE WE SEE GREATER DENSITY AND LOWER DENSITY AND A LOWER BUILDING AS WE MOVE TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND THAT WASN'T THERE. THAT'S WHY WE HAD THE ROCKY BUILDINGS AND WE MADE THE CHANGE. WE ALSO DIDN'T HAVE A BIKE WAY AND NOW WE ARE SEEING DEVELOPMENT THAT REALLY FACES THAT AND WILL HOPEFULLY ENCOURAGE BIKING DIRECTLY FROM THAT BUILDING. YOU KNOW, IS THIS BUILDING EVERYTHING THAT WE WOULD HOPE FOR, AND NO, IS IT FAIR TO HOLD THEM TO THAT STANDARD? I BELIEVE THAT THAT'S NOT THE CASE. SO I DO THINK THIS BUILDING COMPARED TO A SURFACE PARKING LOT, DOES BRING, YOU KNOW, A LOT -- MUCH NEEDED HOUSING AS SOMEONE WHO WORKS WITH UNDERGRADUATES EVERY DAY, I CAN CONFIRM THAT, THAT THERE'S ALMOST NEAR UNIVERSAL AVOIDANCE OF 8 A.M. CLASSES. I DON'T EXPECT THAT THERE WILL BE A LOT OF TRAFFIC AND CERTAINLY THOSE STUDENTS DON'T DRIVE TO CAMPUS FROM THIS KIND OF LOCATION. AND I JUST WANT TO EXTEND AN OFFER TO COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER THAT HE WOULD LIKE TO WORK ON PARKING MAXIMUMS. I THINK THERE ARE OTHERS AT THE TABLE, WOULD WOU WHO WOULD BE HO SO. THANKS.
02:23:13.725: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION?
02:23:15.327: >> Councilmember Bannister: YES, I HAD A QUESTION. I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S FOR MR. CAAN. BUT IT WAS TO FOLLOW UP ON ETHEL POTTS. SHE MENTIONED WE MAY HAVE AN ILLEGAL SETBACK ON THE ALLEY, THAT IT'S TOO CLOSE TO THE NEIGHBOR'S PROPERTY BEHIND THERE, THAT IT'S 16 FEET WHEN IT SHOULD BE 30 FEET. I WAS WONDERING YOUR COMMENTS.
02:23:50.762: >> I BELIEVE MS. POTS WAS REFERRING TO THE EAST SIDE. AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IT'S 30 FEET. SCOTT, CAN YOU CONFIRM THAT?
02:23:56.335: >> COULD YOU SHOW ME ON THIS DRAWING, BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE ZERO AND ZERO IN THE SCHEDULE.
02:24:00.939: >> IF YOU LOOK ON THE DRAWING WHERE IT JUST SHOWS ANY OF THE PARTICULAR FLOOR PLANS, YOU WILL SEE THE ALLEY IS 16 FEET AND THEN IN ADDITION TO THAT, WE PROVIDED A REDLINE, ADD THOSE TWO TOGETHER AND THAT'S HOW YOU GET YOUR 30 FEET. MOST OF THE TIME, YOU ARE MUCH FURTHER BACK THAN THAT. AND THAT ONLY APPLIED TO THE PROPERTY, THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE SITE WHICH IS ADJACENT TO THE R4C ZONING, NEXT TO THE D2 ZONING. WE DO WIDEN THE ALLEY THERE BY ABOUT A FOOT AND A HALF, JUST BY PULLING OUR BUILDING BACK SLIGHTLY.
02:24:34.773: >> Councilmember Bannister: OKAY. AND THEN JUST I HAD A FOLLOW-UP QUESTION ON THAT -- OR OTHER ON THINGS. WOULD SOMEONE ENUMERATE THE PUBLIC BENEFITS IN THIS PROJECT?
02:24:46.251: >> THIS PRO E JECT DOES NOT NEED NO TECHNICALLY MEET ANY PUBLIC BENEFIT, BECAUSE IT'S NOT A -- A PLANNED PROJECT OR A PUD, BUT I CAN TRY TO DESCRIBE TO YOU WHAT WE BELIEVE SOME OF THE PUBLIC BENEFITS ARE.
02:24:59.464: >> Councilmember Bannister: THANK YOU.
02:25:00.732: >> ONE OF THE PUBLIC BENS IS PROVIDING STORMWATER FOR THE ENTIRE SITE, WHICH IS OVER AN ACRE IN SIZE, DOWNTOWN IN THE ALLEN CREEK WHICH IS A HUGE PUBLIC BENEFIT. WE WOULD LIKE THEY ARE TARGETING THE LEED SILVER STANDARD AND WE ARE HOLDING THEM TO THAT IN THE DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT. WE LIKE THE FACT THAT THEY ARE COMING UP WITH -- WITH A SOLAR-READY ROOF SYSTEM, FOR BOTH THE PRIMARY ROOFS. WE LIKE THE FACT THAT BICYCLE PARKING IS IN EXCESS OF WHAT THE REQUIREMENT IS. WE ARE REALLY, REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE WANTED THE ADDITIONAL 7.5 FEET OF SIDEWALK SPACE ON WILLIAM AND THE PETITIONER WAS WILLING TO PROVIDE THAT TO US IN THE FORM OF AN AXIS. THIS WILL PROVIDE TO US A 16-FOOT WIDE SIDEWALK IN THIS LOCATION, WHICH WE BELIEVE IS A SUBSTANTIAL PUBLIC BENEFIT. THEY ORIGINALLY PROPOSED 8 AND A HALF FEET WHICH IS TIGHT. AND THEY HAVE A MIXED USE WHICH WILL ACTIVATE THE SOUTH SIDE OF WILLIAM AND MAIN. I'M GOING TO SEE IF JOHN HAD ADDITIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL GAINS. I KNOW THAT HE HAD MENTIONED THAT IN HIS ORIGINAL COMMENT DURING THE PUBLIC HEARING PORTION AND HE MAY WANT TO ADD A FEW THINGS.
02:26:39.231: >> THANK YOU, JEFF. WE ARE PROVIDING FOUR ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING STATION AND WE ARE GETTING THE BUILDING READY FOR MORE. WE THINK THAT WILL CHANGE OVER TIME, BUT WE DON'T KNOW TO WHAT EXTENT, AND WE WILL BE PREPARED FOR THAT. I KNOW SOMETIMES WE TAKE LEED FOR GRANTED. A LEED SILVER BUILDING IS NOT AN EASY BUILDING TO DO. SO DESPITE THE FACT THAT ONLY 1% OF THE BUILDING IS GOING TO BE POWERED WITH SOLAR, IT COULD ACTUALLY BE SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED IF THE RULES ARE CHANGED AND WE ARE ALLOWED TO ACTUALLY PUT IT ON TOP OF THE FIVE-STORY PORTION. OVERALL, NOW WE HAVE TO USE OTHER METHODS TO ACHIEVE THE POINTS THAT WE WILL NEED FOR THE LEED SILVER, WHICH HAVE A LOT TO DO WITH OUR ENVIRONMENTAL SYSTEMS AND WHAT WE WILL BE USING. WE HAVE TO DO OFFSETS WHEN WE HAVE A SMALL HEATED PATIO THAT WE WANT TO HEAT OUTSIDE SO PEOPLE HAVE THE ABILITY TO USE THAT SPACE. AND I THINK MAINLY, THE BIG IMPORTANT PART IS THERE WILL BE A CONTRIBUTION TO THE CITY PARKS AS WELL AS THE FACT THAT FROM A LEED PERSPECTIVE, IT'S REALLY ABOUT THE MATERIALS THAT WE USE TO BUILD THE BUILDING AND THE SYSTEMS THAT WE'LL GO THROUGH TO RECYCLE THE BUILDING, WE WILL TAKE DOWN.
02:27:48.266: >> THANK YOU.
02:27:49.968: >> Mayor Taylor: COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
02:27:50.969: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I MEAN THIS STUFF IS NOT OUT OF THINK AIR. I'M TAKING OFF FROM THE DRAWING SET THAT WAS DOWN THERE FOR PUBLIC COMMENT AND PUBLIC NOTICE FROM JANUARY 31st, IT SAYS ZERO ELECTRIC PARKING SPACES. AND IT SAYS THE REAR SETBACK IS BETWEEN THE ALLEY -- THE ALLEY SETBACK IS 1.4 FEET AND 34 FEET. IT VARIES. SO THAT'S NOT -- 14 IS THE MINIMUM, PLUS THE 16 TO BE THE ALLEY TO BE 30 FEET. SO I GUESS I'M NOT SEEING THAT. I WANT TO POINT OUT TO MY COLLEAGUES THAT WHAT IS HERE IN THE SCHEDULES IS NOT WHAT WE ARE HEARING. THAT'S ALL. I WHAT TONIGHT MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE BUILDING THE RIGHT STUFF.
02:28:23.335: >> I THINK WHAT YOU ARE SEEING IN THE SCHEDULE IS -- IT'S GIVING YOU -- AND JEFF WOULD PROBABLY HAVE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THAT, BUT IT'S GIVING YOU SETBACK FOR THE VERY MOST NORTHERLY BUILDING AND THEN AS WE GET TO PACKARD, WE GO TO 34 FEET WHICH IS THE FARTHEST. AND YOU CAN SEE THE RED LINE THAT SHOWS THE SETBACK.
02:28:45.857: >> SURE. SO THE 1.4, PLUS 16, 17.4 FROM THE NEIGHBOR'S BACK LINE, RIGHT?
02:29:02.641: >> THIS IS WHAT IS REQUIRED.
02:29:05.010: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I USED TO LIVE NEXT DOOR TO 615 AND IT'S A REALLY DIFFERENT STREET. SOUTH MAIN HAS CHANGED A LOT. AND DIVISION USED TO MEAN THE UNIVERSITY IS ON THAT SIDE AND THE CITY IS ON THIS SIDE, NOT ANYMORE. CONSTANTLY SEEING THE STUDENTS GOING BACK AND FORTH. I'M NOT SURE THAT'S HEALTHY FOR OUR ECONOMY.
02:29:27.365: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER DISCUSSION? ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE. STARTING WITH COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.

I SAT ON THAT GROUP. IT WAS A LOT OF WORK AND IT CAME OUT WELL AND I WANT TO THANK COUNCILMEMBER GRAND FOR PUTTING A GOOD TEAM TOGETHER. IT SEEMED TO WORK.

02:31:51.309: >> LADIES FIRST.
02:31:52.610: >> GOOD EVENING, COUNCIL, CITY ATTORNEY, CITIZENS I'M HERE TO WORK IN THE OFFICE OF THE CITIZEN. I WENT TO NORTHSIDE. I WENT TO CLAWSON AND I GRADUATED IN '85. I MOVED BACK HERE FROM OREGON AFTER WORKING IN CORPORATE AMERICA AND SEEING HOW IT FUNCTIONS AT INTEL. I ALSO WORKED AT THE UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL AS A PSYCHIATRIC CLERK AND I'M -- ON THE UNITS, I ALSO WORKED AS THE OUTPATIENT PHARMACY CLERK, HANDING OUT MEDICINE TO ALL THE PEOPLE THAT WORK AT THE HOSPITAL. I LIVE AT 3400 PITSVIEW DRIVE, RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET FROM MITCHELL ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. MY CHILDREN WENT TO MITCHELL. MY CHILDREN WENT TO SCARLET. AND I HAVE A CHILD THAT WENT TO COMMUNITY AND GRADUATED AND ONE THAT'S PENNING GRADUATION. SHE'S A JUNIOR NOW. I HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS SITUATION THAT HAPPENED WITH THE CHIEF. I HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SITUATION THAT HAPPENED WITH THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR. I HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE FIRE CHIEF, AND WHERE HE WENT AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER THAT. I ALSO HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE FORMAL H.R. REPRESENTATIVE OR DIRECTOR. HAVING BEEN IN CORPORATE AMERICA, AND WORKED WITH LOTS OF WHITE PEOPLE, AND HAVE A WHITE MOTHER, A WHITE STEPFATHER, A WHITE LITTLE BROTHER AND MY CHILDREN ALL SELF-IDENTIFY AS WHITE. I GET THE INSIDE SCOOP ON HOW RACISM WORKS. IT'S NOT THE CRASS OUTWARD RACISM THAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT. IT'S THE RACISM THAT HAPPENS IN THE BACKROOM, ON THE CHAT DEVICES THAT MY COUNCILMEMBERS ARE USING DURING CITY COUNCIL MEETINGS. I WOULD LIKE TO ASK THE REPRESENTATIVATION FOR THE OFFICE OF THE CITIZEN. YOU HAVE THE CITY ATTORNEY AT YOUR DISPOSAL. AND THE FORMER ADMINISTRATOR HAS AN ATTORNEY TO REPRESENT HIS INTERESTS. WHERE IS THE LEGAL REPRESENTATION FOR THE OFFICE OF THE CITIZEN. I HAVE COME HERE TONIGHT. I HAVE SEEN MY COUNCILPERSON JULIE GRAND RIGHT THERE. I DON'T SEE MR. ACKERMAN HERE AND I'M WONDERING WHAT'S GOING ON. HAVING BEEN IN CORPORATE AMERICA, I A LOT OF THINGS CAN BE SOLVED BY BOOKING A MEETING ROOM. THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN. AS I START TO PUT MY CHILDREN OUT THERE IN THE WORLD AND SAY, HEY, GO TO THE CITY AND GET A JOB, WHAT LION'S DEN AM. I SENDING THEM INTO? WILL THEIR OPPORTUNITIES BE THE SAME? THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
02:34:57.462: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. [ APPLAUSE ]
02:35:09.540: >> GOOD AFTERNOON, MY NAME IS PASTOR TROY TAYLOR AND MR. DANIELS INVITED ME TO THIS MEETING. I WORKED FOR GENERAL MOTORS UNDERCOVER SECURITY, AND I MET MANY COX A -- MR. COX AND I TOOE WILL ABOUT HIM BECAUSE I WANTED TO WORK WITH HIM. I WANTED TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM IN TRAFFIC AT ANN ARBOR. I SOLVED THE TRAFFIC PROBLEM FOR GENERAL MOTORS. THEY NEED TO CHANGE SOME OF THE HOURS IN ANN ARBOR WORKING AND WE CAN GET THEM OUT OF HERE QUICKLY. THE OTHER THING, WE NEED WATER TO DRINK, BECAUSE OUR BODY IS 66% WATER AND I WILL DIE WITHOUT WATER. THAT'S MY BIGGEST APPETITE IS WATER. AND ANOTHER THING THAT HAPPENED, WHEN WE HAD CHIEF JONES HERE, WE HAD A LOT OF FIGHTS AT A HIGH SCHOOL. HE SAID DON'T GET INTO POLICE BUSINESS. I LEFT AND I WAS VERY DISCOURAGED. I DID MY ORDINARY JOB GOING TO THE JUVENILE HOME ON PLATT ROAD AND JUDGE JUDY WOODS HAD SEEN ME. SHE SAID COME HERE FOR A MINUTE. HOW DO WE SOLVE THE PROBLEM WITH THESE CHILDREN. I SAID, JUDGE! LOOK AT THE CHILDREN. ALL OF THEM IS ON LUNCH HOUR AT 11:00. THEY ARE ON HURON AND YPSILANTI. AND THEY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO OVER TO ANN ARBOR AND BEAT UP PEOPLE AND NEVER GET CAUGHT. SHE CHANGED THE LUNCH HOURS. IT STOPPED FOR 30 YEARS. NOBODY RUN FOR AN HOUR. SPRING BREAK, SHE CHANGED THAT AROUND. IT'S A LOT OF CHANGING WE CAN DO TO GET THINGS BETTER IN ANN ARBOR. AND TRAFFIC IS REALLY BAD! AND I HAD THOUGHT -- I SAID, WELL, THEY DON'T WANT TO SPEND NO MONEY ON OVERHEAD TRAFFIC AND SO IF WE CHANGED SOME OF THE HOURS, THE WORKING HOURS, THE TRAFFIC WILL -- YOU WILL SEE A BIG IMPROVEMENT BECAUSE I HAVE SEEN 10,000 PEOPLE AT GRANDGENERALMOTORS. I GOT THEM OUT OF THE PARKING LOTS IN AN HOUR. WHEN WE CHANGED ALL TO SHIFT HOURS THEY HAD TO CHANGE PEOPLE BY A HALF HOUR, AND OTHER PEOPLE AN HOUR AND ALL WORKED. AND SO THANK YOU ALL. AND HAVE A GOOD DAY. I LOVE IT. THIS IS MY HOMETOWN. I MOVED TO DETROIT JUST FOR UNDERCOVER SECURITY TO BRING GENERAL MOTORS BACK TO WHERE THEY WAS. THERE WAS DOPE IN THE PLANT. WE HAD ALL KIND OF STUFF AND I HAD DID A JOB OUT HERE WITH CAPTAIN BUTTONS AND SOME OTHER POLICE WORKING UNDERCOVER WITH THEM. AND SO ANN ARBOR HAS BEEN GRAPH IT TO ME. THIS IS MY HOME. THANK YOU.
02:37:45.963: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. [ APPLAUSE ]
02:37:56.174: >> HELLO, MAYOR AND COUNCIL. MY NAME IS SHIRLEY BECKLEY AND, OF COURSE, I HAVE BEEN HERE SEVERAL TIMES. I HAD TO TALK TO MYSELF, BECAUSE I HAVE SAID I WASN'T GOING TO SAY ANYTHING, BUT I DON'T THINK THAT YOU ALL IN GENERAL LISTEN TO THE PUBLIC. I WANT TO SAY THAT WE WORKED SO HARD TO GET THE ICPOC COMMISSION SET UP AFTER THE DEATH OF AURAL ROSSER FIVE YEARS AGO OF WHICH NONE OF OUR DEMANDS WERE MADE EXCEPT THAT ONE AND THEN YOU PULLED A LOT OF THEIR POWER AWAY, BUT AT LEAST THEY ARE THERE, AND WE CAN GO TO THEM. BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SAY TO YOU TONIGHT, AS A SENIOR MEMBER OF THIS CITY FOR 77 YEARS, I FOUND IS IT VERY HURTFUL THAT I COULD NOT FIND WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH WITHOUR POLICE CHIEF. I FOUND IT HURTFUL THAT WE HAD A COMMISSION AND NOBODY KNEW NOTHING. I WASN'T ALLOWED TO TALK TO THE POLICE CHIEF. HE WASN'T ALLOWED TO TALK TO ME AND WE'RE CITIZENS HERE. WE VOTE FOR YOU. WE TALKED ABOUT HAVING ALL OF THIS TO BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN THE COMMUNITY AND OUR POLICE. THIS DOES NOT HELP. THERE'S NO BRIDGE. WE'RE OUT HERE NOT KNOWING ANYTHING OTHER THAN WHAT I SAT HERE ALL OF THESE HOURS TO LISTEN TO THIS REPORT THAT STILL DOESN'T TELL ME TOO MUCH OTHER THAN YOU LET HIM COME BACK. BUT THEN I'M WONDERING WHAT KIND OF PROTECTION HE HAS. BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE A HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT FOR HIM. AS A BLACK MAN IN THIS CITY, I KNOW IT WILL BE HOSTILE, AS A BLACK WOMAN LIVING IN THIS CITY. I JUST HOPE THAT YOU RECOMMEND YOUR COMMITMENT THAT YOU ARE GOING TO CREATE A BRIDGE THAT YOU KNOCKED DOWN BY LEAVING US OUT. I WOULD IMPRESS ON YOU TO PLEASE TRY TO REMEMBER WE ARE HERE. WE ARE TRYING TO WORK TOGETHER. AND DON'T KEEP US IN THE DARK LIKE THIS. THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN BRIDGE THAT GAP IF WE ARE LEFT IN THE DARK. I KNOW YOU DON'T LIKE TO LISTEN TO SOME OF THE THINGS WE HAVE TO SAY, BUT IT COMES FROM A HEARTFELT PLACE. AND BASICALLY, I'M TIRED OF THE RACISM THAT I AND MY CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN AND GREAT GRANDCHILDREN HAVE TO FACE, SINCE YOU ARE NOT GIVING US ANSWERS ABOUT OUR POLICE CHIEF. I HOPE THERE'S SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN HAVE THAT WE CAN COME TOGETHER AND REALLY FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED. THANK YOU.
02:41:04.528: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU.
02:41:12.069: >> GOOD EVENING, COUNCIL. MY NAME IS RAD SATTERITE. I HAVE LIVED IN ANN ARBOR SINCE 1988, I GUESS 22 YEARS. I GREW UP HERE AND USED TO WORK HERE. I WANTED TO ADDRESS THE FRANKLY CHEAP WAY THAT THE PHRASE "MOVE FORWARD" HAS BEEN USED BY COUNCILMEMBERS IN REGARDS TO RECENT EVENTS. I AGREE AND ALMOST EVERYONE AGREES THAT IT IS VITAL THAT WE MOVE FORWARD BUT TO TRULY MOVE FORWARD MEANS THAT WE NEED TO RECONCILE WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE PAST. IT IS WONDERFUL THAT THE COUNCIL HAVING BEEN PRIVY TO INFORMATION THAT THE PUBLIC HAS YET TO RECEIVE, HAS KIND OF COME TO TERMS WITH WHAT HAS HAPPENED AND IS READY TO MOVE FORWARD. HOWEVER, IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THE COUNCIL VISCERALLY UNDERSTAND THE UNFAIRNESS OF ASKING THIS COMMUNITY TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THEM, WHEN MANY OF US HAVE HAVE NOT BEEN MADE PRIVY TO WHAT HAS HAPPENED. WHILE I UNDERSTAND THAT NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS ARE FAIRLY TYPICAL IN THESE KIND OF SWAYINGSES, FIND THE RECEIPT -- OF SITUATIONS, I FIND THE RHETORIC THAT WE SWEEP THIS UNDER THE RUG IN THE NAME OF PEACE TO REPRESENT A LACK OF COURAGE. MANY TRUTHS INTEGRAL TO OUR COUNTRY'S HISTORY ARE UGLY, NAUSEATING BLIGHTS UPON OUR COLLECTIVE IDENTITY. HOWEVER, THE ABSOLUTE WORST THING THAT WE CAN DO IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES IS TO NOT PAY THEM THE ATTENTION THAT THEY WARRANT. IT IS AND ONCE WE OPENLY DISCUSS THEM AND THAT THE PROCESS OF HEALING CAN BEGIN. ICPOC AND OTHERS WHO SPOKE, I AM INTERESTED IN MOVING FORWARD AND I IMPLORE THE COUNCIL TO RECONSIDER HOW THEY WEIGH THEIR TRANSPARENCY OBLIGATIONS GOING FORWARD, BECAUSE IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT WE ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT THE COST OF MOVING FORWARD IS NOT A COST BORN BY ALL MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY. THANK YOU.
02:43:21.599: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. [ APPLAUSE ]
02:43:27.138: >> HELLO. MY NAME IS ZACHARY STORY. I JUST CAME BACK TODAY FROM NEW YORK CITY. SO I SPENT A LOT OF TIME RIDING PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION, WHICH IS REALLY GREAT. AND I HOPE THAT WE CAN IMPROVE OUR PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. I TOOK TWO SUBWAYS AND TODAY, I CAN WATCH THE BUS HOME, ALTHOUGH, SOMETIMES, IF THE MEETING GOES REALLY LATE, YOU KNOW, SOME PEOPLE WOULD RELY ON THE BUS FOR TRANSPORTATION, SOMETIMES THE MEETINGS HERE HAVE GONE ON LATER THAN THAT. SO THAT KIND OF LIMITS PEOPLE'S ACCESS. BUT MAINLY, I ALSO DO WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE POLICE MATTER AND I REALLY HAVE -- I'M GLAD THAT OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITIES SPEAKING BEFORE ME AND I LISTENED TO A LOT OF WHAT WAS SAID, AND AS FAR AS RACISM, AS WHITE PEOPLE, WE HAVE TO BRING THAT UP TOO. IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE JUST NEED TO WAIT FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR TO BRING IT UP. FROM WHAT HAPPENED TO -- TO JUST WHAT I HEARD FROM SOME OF YOU HERE OF THE EXPERIENCE IN THIS CITY, IN PARTICULAR, AND FROM SPENDING A WEEK IN NEW YORK CITY, WHAT -- SO MANY GREAT THINGS ABOUT THAT CITY, BUT THE DIVERSITY, PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION AS A MODE THAT PEOPLE OF ALL INCOME LEVELS AND RACES AND GEOGRAPHY OF THE CITY USE TOGETHER AND PEOPLE JUST LIFT EACH OTHER UP, AND COME INTO CONTACT WITH MORE DIVERSE PEOPLE. I REALLY THINK THAT'S HOW WE BREAK DOWN THE BARRIERS OF RACISM, AND PEOPLE COMING FROM DIFFERENT LIFE EXPERIENCES WHO MAY NOT HAVE -- WHO LEARN THINGS FROM SOCIAL CONDITIONING OR FAMILY MEMBERS AND, YOU KNOW, ONCE YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO INTERACT WITH DIFFERENT TYPES OF PEOPLE, THEN THAT'S WHEN WE CAN LEARN FROM EACH OTHER AND MOVE FORWARD. AND ANOTHER POLICE MATTER. I NEED TO CATCH UP ON EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED, BUT LANSING HAS HIRED A SOCIAL WORKER WITHIN THE POLICE DEPARTMENT, AND I REALLY HOPE THAT WE CAN FOLLOW THAT LEAD ON THAT WOULD JUST WORK WONDERS WITH THE HOMELESS POPULATION THAT HAVE A LOT OF CONTACT WITH THE POLICE. SO THANK YOU.
02:46:33.824: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. [ APPLAUSE ]
02:46:40.097: >> GOOD EVENING, MAYOR AND COUNCIL. IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME. I USED TO SIT OVER THERE IN THE FIRST WARD, WHEN THE BUILDING WAS MUCH UGLIER. AND TODAY I FIND IT UGLY. I'M SO DISAPPOINTED IN HOW WE HAVE HANDLED THIS MATTER WITH OUR POLICE CHIEF. PERCEPTION IS EVERYTHING. WHETHER OR NOT WE APOLOGIZE, WHETHER OR NOT SOMEONE WAS HURT OR SOMEONE WAS WRONGED, PERCEPTION IS EVERYTHING. WE HAVE A MAN WHO HAD AN IMPECCABLE REPUTATION, AND HE COMES TO MY CITY, THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR. AND HE IS DEVASTATED. WE HAVE WOUNDED HIM. WE HAVE DESTROYED HIS REPUTATION. IT IS GOING TO BE HARD FOR HIM TO WORK WITH THE PEOPLE THAT HE WORKS WITH. I EXPERIENCED COMMUNITY POLICING FIRSTHAND AT ARROWWOOD. WE HAD COMMUNITY OFFICERS WALKING THROUGH. I DIDN'T THINK THE PROGRAM WAS GOING TO WORK BECAUSE WE HAD A WHITE OFFICER. I SAID HE'S NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY WITH OUR KIDS BUT HE WAS ABLE TO DO THAT. THAT COMMUNITY POLICING HELPED US GREATLY IN OUR COOPERATIVE. IT MADE A GREAT DIFFERENCE IN HOW THE POLICE RESPONDED TO US. WHEN I FIRST CAME TO ARROWWOOD, WE CALLED THE POLICE ON OUR KIDS HAVING ACTIVITIES. WE HAD POLICE OFFICERS COME OUT WITH RIOT GEAR ON. GUNS DRAWN. I HAVE BEEN HERE SINCE THE '70s. I CAME HERE DURING WILL SCHOOL AND A THOUGHT THE PARKS WANTED ME TO STAY, AND ALL THE BEAUTIFUL GREENNESS AND THE HOPE FOR THE CITY. WHAT HAVE YOU DONE, NOT PURPOSEFULLY, BUT IT HAS PURPOSE IS HURT A NEW LIGHT, A NEW HOPE THAT WE HAD IN IN OUR COMMUNITY. I KNOW YOU SAID MOVE FORWARD BUT WHEN YOU MOVE FORWARD, YOU THINK ABOUT ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU HAVE ATTACHED TO HIS BACK. YOU THINK ABOUT ALL THE HURT THAT HE HAS IN HIS FAMILY. I AM DISAPPOINTED IN ANN ARBOR. WHAT CAN WE DO TO SUPPORT OUR POLICE CHIEF GOING FORWARD WHEN WE HAVE DONE THIS TO HIS REPUTATION? NOT BEING TRANSPARENT. I HAD TO CALL -- THEY USED TO USE ALL CRIMINAL ACTIVITY IN NORTH SIDE AT ARROWWOOD. IT HAPPEN DOWN THE STREET FROM ARROWWOOD. AND IT HAPPENED ACROSS STREET. AND I SAID IF A CRIME CAN HAPPEN IN ARROWWOOD, WHICH HAS VERY LITTLE CRIME, BELIEVE IT OR NOT BUT YOU MADE US THINK IT WAS A HORRIBLE PLACE TO BE. SO I UNDERSTAND THESE LITTLE BITTY THINGS THAT YOU DO, THE LITTLE BITTY WORDS THAT MAKE PERMANENT DAMAGE. SO CITY COUNCIL, I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU CAN DO, BUT I SUPPORT THE POLICE CHIEF. I DON'T EVEN HAVE ANY INFORMATION, BUT I SUPPORT HIM.
02:49:42.713: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. IS THERE N ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC COMMENT? SEEING NO ONE, PUBLIC COMMENT IS CLOSED DO. WE HAVE A CLOSED SESSION TODAY?
02:50:03.000: >> WE DO HAVE A CLOSED SESSION. THE CLOSED SESSION IS ON A WASHTENAW COUNTY CASE. IT'S PENDING LITIGATION IN THE GELMAN MATTER, WHICH THE CITY IS AN INTERVENER.
02:50:13.610: >> Mayor Taylor: MAY I HAVE A MOTION TO GO INTO CLOSED SESSION, MOVED BY HAYNER AND SECONDED BY GRISWOLD. DISCUSSION?
02:50:22.185: >> Councilmember Griswold: MAY WE HAVE A FIVE-MINUTE BREAK, PLEASE.
02:50:28.892: >> Mayor Taylor: ROLL CALL VOTE.
