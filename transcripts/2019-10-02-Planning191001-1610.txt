SEEING -- OH.
00:03:16.058: >> GOOD EVENING, I'M TOM STALBREG. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT EVALUATING SOME THINGS THAT HAVE COME THROUGH HERE RECENTLY, THIS PAST YEAR, GONE THROUGH COUNCIL, ONE STILL HAS TO GO TO COUNCIL BUT ESSENTIALLY LOOKING AT SOME SITUATIONS THAT HAVE BECOME PROBLEMS OR -- TO LOOK AT THEM OR REEVALUATE THEM IN HINDSIGHT. I HAVE A BACKGROUND AS AN ATHLETE AND COACH, AND AFTER THE GAME, AFTER THE SEASON, WE ALWAYS WANT TO EVALUATE HOW WE DID. DID WE ACHIEVE THE OUTCOME THAT WE WANTED. IF NOT, WHAT CAN WE DO DIFFERENTLY TO ACHIEVE THAT OUTCOME THE NEXT TIME? ONE  OF THE THINGS I WANTED TO LOOK AT IS R1E, IT WAS ZONED ON PONTIAC TRAIL IN NORTH SKY AND ONCE FOR A DEVELOPMENT ON PACKARD THAT THERE WAS LITIGATION ON THAT ONE AND IT'S BACK AS A PUD AND PART OF THE PROBLEM WITH THE ONE ON PACKARD WAS THE SMALL LOT ZONING OF R1E HAD SOME CERTAIN GOALS THAT WE WERE HOPING FOR IN TERMS OF LIMITED SIZE IN THE HOUSING. BUT THEN WE KIND OF FOUND OUT THAT THAT -- OUR TREE ORDINANCE ENDS UP -- IF YOU ARE GOING TO PUT IN SMALL LOTS, YOU HAVE TO WIPE OUT THE SITE TO SITE THE BUILDIBUILDINGS AND DO THE INFRASTRUCTURAL WORK. THEY ARE TRYING TO SETTLE THAT WITH AN PUD. WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT R1E? WE HAVE TWO DATA POINTS NOW. I THINK WE SHOULD LOOK AT R1E, IS IT GIVING US THE RESULTS THAT WE HOPED IT WOULD GIVE US? THERE'S AT LEAST ONE PROBLEM WITH IT. THE OTHER ONE WOULD BE THE COTTAGES AT BARTON GREEN, WHICH HAPPENS TO BE IMMEDIATELY SOUTH EVER THAT PONTIAC TRAIL R1E DEVELOPMENT, AND THEY ARE -- YOU KNOW, THAT WENT TO LITIGATION AND NOBODY LIKED IT, IT SEEMED. BUT WE WERE STUCK WITH IT BY RIGHT. AND SO WHY? WHAT CAN WE DO DIFFERENTLY? IF THAT ONE WAS BY RIGHT, ANOTHER ONE COULD COME IN TOMORROW. ARE WE PREPARED FOR THAT? SO WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT WHAT CAN WE CHANGE IN OUR ORDINANCES IF THERE'S SOMETHING WE CAN DO. AGAIN BEING I'M NOT SHEER WITH AN ANSWER -- I'M NOT WITH AN ANSWER, LET'S LOOK AT IT AGAIN BEFORE IT BITES US AGAIN, BEFORE WE GET ANOTHER APPLICATION THAT WE WILL HAVE TO APPROVE LIKE THE COTTAGES. AND THEN THE OTHER ONE IS CAMPUS BUSINESS ZONING. THOSE OF YOU WHO AREN'T BRAND NEW TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION HAVE HEARD ME TALK A LOT ABOUT CAMPUS BUSINESS ZONING. IT'S PROBLEMATIC. IT'S NOT PORTABLE, AS SOME PEOPLE WOULD LIKE IT TO BE. IT IS A CORE. WE HAVE FOUR CORE AND CORE TRANSITION ZONING CATEGORIES, C1A AND C1A-R AND D1 AND D2 AND IT DOESN'T BELONG ANYWHERE ELSE. WE SHOULD LOOK AT ELIMINATING THAT OR PUTTING A MORATORIUM ON CAMPUS BUSINESS ZONING BECAUSE IT WILL CREATE MORE PROBLEMS AND MORE LITIGATION. THANK YOU.
00:06:15.871: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION ON AN ITEM THAT'S NOT ON THE AGENDA?
00:06:27.983: >> MY NAME IS NATHAN SHEDLACK, I LIVE IN LANSING. I'M ACTUALLY HERE ON BEHALF OF KEN BRYANT WHO IS A LOCAL BUSINESS OWNER. HE SENT IN SOME CORRESPONDENCE ABOUT HIS PROBLEM AS A MEDICAL MARIJUANA PROVISIONING CENTER AND THE S.E.U. CAP. I'M NOT HERE TO TALK ABOUT HIS LETTER, HE HIT THE POINTS THERE, BUT I WANT TO LET YOU KNOW WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE IN A PRACTICAL MANNER. I GET WIND OF DEALS AND THINGS GOING ON IN THE FIELD OF CANNABIS AND THERE'S A PROPERTY HERE. I HAVE THE ADDRESS. I WON'T GIVE IT TO YOU RIGHT NOW BUT IT HAS AN S.E.U., AND LONG-STORY SHORT, THE TENANT HAD A TEN-YEAR LEASE AND HE COULDN'T GET A STATE LICENSE. HE BOTCHED THE PROCESS AND HE'S NO LONGER ABLE TO GET ONE. HE'S GOT SIX YEARS LEFT ON THE LEASE WITH A TEN-YEAR OPTION. HE'S NOW SHOPPING THIS LEASE FOR $8 MILLION. AND THAT ONLY GETS YOU THE LEASE. IT'S AN 1800 SQUARE FOOT BUILDING. IT'S ALL ON THE SECOND FLOOR. AND YOU DO NOT GET ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE LEASE. YOU STILL HAVE TO PAY WHAT AMOUNTS TO $4,000 A MONTH WITH A 2% INCREASE EACH YEAR. SO IF THIS IS -- IF YOUR GOAL IS TO GET 28 OPEN, I CAN TELL YOU RIGHT NOW THAT THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN BECAUSE OF THINGS LIKE THIS GOING ON. ONE THING TO COMBAT THIS GOING FORWARD, I THINK YOU MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER IS WHEN YOU ARE DRAFTING YOUR ADULT USE ORDINANCE, YOU MIGHT WANT TO SAY SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF YOU HAD TO HAVE A MEDICAL FACILITY OPEN AND OPERATING BY SUCH AND SUCH A DATE OR FOR SO LONG PRIOR TO GETTING AN ADULT USE PERMIT. DO YOU THAT, AND YOU WILL SEE ONE OF TWO THINGS HAPPEN. YOU WILL SEE PLACES OPEN OR YOU SEE THESE PLACES STAY VACANT BECAUSE ALL THE SPEC IS DO ON THE ADULT USE. I WOULD URGE YOU TO CONSIDER THAT AND I APPRECIATE THE BOARD FOR THEIR TIME.
00:08:20.028: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE? ALL RIGHT. MOVING ON TO PUBLIC HEARINGS SCHEDULED FOR NEXT BUSINESS MEETING ON OCTOBER 15th.
00:08:32.140: >> WE ACTUALLY HAVE TWO PUB HEARINGS SCHEDULED FOR RESEARCH PARK DRIVE, ONE IS 3955 RESEARCH PARK DRIVE FOR A RESEARCH FOR CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL. AND AIL SECOND ONE AT -- NEXT DOOR AT 3959 MERCEDES-BENZ RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION APPROVAL. HOWEVER, WE ARE -- WE HAVE HEARD AND THERE'S A POSSIBILITY THAT THAT PETITION IS GOING TO BE WITHDRAWN. SO I WILL KEEP THE PLANNING COMMISSION COMPRISED OF THE STATUS OF THAT PETITION.
00:09:03.205: >> Chair Milshteyn: GREAT. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. MOVING ON TO UNFINISHED BUSINESS. THE FIRST ITEM THAT WE HAVE IS HIDEAWAY LANE PLANNED PROJECT SITE PLAN FOR CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL. OUR PROCEDURE FOR THIS EVENING, WE WILL HEAR FROM THE PETITIONER. THEY WILL HAVE UP TO 10 MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION. WE WILL THEN GET A STAFF REPORT, AND THEN WE'LL OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING. AND AFTER THAT, WE WILL GO TO A MOTION AND DISCUSSION AND ULTIMATELY A VOTE. SO I WILL BEGIN WITH THE PETITIONER HERE.
00:09:31.233: >> THANK YOU, CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU, COMMISSIONERS. MY NAME IS MICHAEL POWELL. I'M THE DESIGN ENGINEER FOR THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT AND I WOULD LIKE TO LET THE COMMISSION KNOW THAT THE OWNER IS HERE, MR. TONY RANDAZO IS HERE, THE LANDSCAPE ARCHITECT IS HERE, AND THE ACTUAL ENGINEER IS HERE AS WELL. SO THAT BEING SAID, I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT. THIS PROJECT IS A PIECE OF PROPERTY THAT WAS ORIGINALLY APPROVED BACK IN THE 1960s AND THEN MODIFIED BY THIS COMMISSION IN 2013. THE -- NEXT PAGE, PLEASE. OKAY. THE CURRENT PROPOSAL THAT HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THE PLANNING COMMISSION HAS 19 SINGLE FAMILY HOMES ON IT. ONE HOME IS CURRENTLY BUILT. THE PROPOSAL IS TO BUILD 17 DUPLEXES AND STILL MAINTAIN THE ONE SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENTIAL ON IT, FOR A TOTAL OF 35 INDIVIDUAL UNITS. THE ZONING IS PROPOSED TO STAY THE SAME. IT'S R4A, MULTIPLE FAMILY. AGAIN, THE HISTORY ON THE PROJECT, THE EXISTING SITE PLAN WAS APPROVED IN 2013 WITH 19 SINGLE FAMILIARLY HOMES. TWO WEEKS AGO, I APPEARED BEFORE YOU, AND PRESENTED THIS PROJECT TO YOU AND THE FEEDBACK WAS EXTREMELY HELPFUL FOR US THIS WEEK IN ADDRESSING SOME OF THE CONCERNS OF THE PUBLIC AND THE PLANNING COMMISSION. AS PART OF THIS PRESENTATION, I LOOKED TO PRESENT THE STATUS OF CONSTRUCTION THAT WAS A BIG ISSUE AMONGST THE RESIDENTS THAT CAME FORWARD. THE PARKING ISSUE, TRAFFIC, SITE OPEN SPACE, STORMWATER SYSTEM, THE IMPETUS OR WHY THE CHANGE IS BEING REQUESTED, CHANGES TO THE PLAN THAT WERE REQUESTED BY STAFF DUE TO THE CURRENT REQUIREMENTS AND THERE WAS AN ISSUE ON SETBACKS ON THE PROJECT. SO THE PLAN UP ON TOP, IN FRONT OF YOU, IS THE 19 SINGLE FAMILY HOME SITES. YOU CAN SEE THE LAYOUT RUNS ALONG THE EAST PART OF THE PROPERTY, SOUTH AND THEN FILLED IN WITH NINE SINGLE FAMILY HOMES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SITE. THERE ARE NINE EXISTING APARTMENTS CURRENTLY BUILT ON THE FRONT PORTION OR THE NORTHERLY PORTION OF THIS PROJECT, AND THOSE HOME SITES NOW ARE FULLY OCCUPIED. THEY HAVE BEEN THERE SINCE BEFORE THE APPROVAL OF THE SINGLE FAMILY HOMES, AND THEY HAVE A TOTALLY INDEPENDENT PARKING. THEY HAVE ONE PARKING SPACE DEDICATED TO EACH AND EVERY EXISTING RESIDENTIAL UNIT THERE, AND THEN SEVEN ADDITIONAL PARKING SPACES FOR GUESTS OR THEIR SECOND PARKING. E PLAN AT THE BOTTOM IS WHAT WE ARE PROPOSING TO CHANGE TO, AND YOU CAN SEE THE SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE TWO PROJECTS. THE LAYOUT IS VERY, VERY SIMILAR, EXCEPT THAT EACH OF THE BUILDINGS NOW IS TO BE A DUPLEX. TWO FAMILY HOME SITES INSTEAD OF A SINGLE FAMILY HOME SITE. SO WE'RE DOUBLING THE NUMBER OF HOMES BUT WE ACTUALLY HAVE ONE LESS STRUCTURE. THE HOMES IN THE CENTER OF THE PROJECT ARE SLIGHTLY LARGER. EACH AND EVERY UNIT IS GOING TO HAVE A TWO-CAR GARAGE. SO THEY ARE GOING TO BE COVERED GARAGES AND THERE ARE GOING TO BE SOME ADDITIONAL GUEST PARKING SPACESSEN ADDITIONAL 10 PARKING SPACES JUST SPECIFICALLY FOR THIS PROJECT AND THEN THERE'S PARKING IN FRONT OF EACH GARAGE. SO THE AMOUNT OF PARKING FAR EXCEEDS WHAT THE ZONING ORDINANCES REQUIRES. JUST TO POINT OUT A LITTLE BIT IN THE LOWER PLAN AND YOU CAN SEE THE RAILROAD TRACKS ARE TO THE RIGHT OR TO THE SOUTH OF THE PROJECT. THAT'S THE REAR END OF THE SITE. OUR STORMWATER THEN IS BETWEEN THE UNITS AND THE -- AND THE RAILROAD TRACKS. AND TRAVER DRAIN OR TRAVER CREEK RUNS ALONG THE SOUTHERN, BOTTOM PART OF THE SITE THERE, ALONG THE WESTERLY SIDE OF THE SITE. THE STATUS OF CONSTRUCTION, THE EXISTING SINGLE FAMILY HOME THAT YOU SEE THERE IS FULLY COMPLETED, TOTALLY APPROVED BY THE BUILDING DEPARTMENT. ITS STATUS IS WE APPLIED FOR THE TEMPORARY CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY, AND IT PASSED ALL THE REQUIREMENTS AND WE ARE LOOKING FOR THE BUILDING DEPARTMENT TO ISSUE THE TEMPORARY CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY. AN, SHOE THAT CAME UP -- AN ISSUE THAT CAME UP AT THE LAST PLANNING COMMISSION, YOU SEE JUST TO THE LEFT OF THAT BUILDING, THERE ARE TWO EXISTING BASEMENTS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN DUG AND BUILT IN THAT AREA. ONE OF THE RESIDENTS WERE CONCERNED THAT THERE WASN'T FENCING AROUND THAT TO SECURE IT. THAT FENCING HAS BEEN PUT IN. IT'S A CHAIN-LINKED FENCING TIGHTLY CONSTRUCTED AND THAT'S WHAT THE GREEN CIRCLE REPRESENTS AS WELL. THERE WAS A QUESTION BY A RESIDENT ABOUT THE STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY OF THOSE BASEMENTS. OBVIOUSLY, THE BUILDING DEPARTMENT WILL ASK A STRUCTURAL ENGINEER OR THE ARCHITECT TO CERTIFY THE QUALITY OF THOSE BASEMENTS AND THE ARCHITECT HAS, IN FACT CERTIFIED TO THOSE. THERE WAS A QUESTION ON THE CONSTRUCTION TRAFFIC COMING UP AND DOWN IN FRONT OF THIS PARTICULAR HOME WHICH IS THE MAIN ENTRANCE TO THE SITE, CONCERNED ABOUT THE SAFETY AND THE WELFARE OF THE CHILDREN IN THE AREA. THE OWNER HAS ABSOLUTELY AGREED THAT HE WILL HAVE SIGNAGE OUT FRONT TO CAUTION THE CONSTRUCTION TRAFFIC DURING THE BUILD OUT OF THIS -- OF THESE HOMES. THAT THERE ARE CHILDREN AT PLAY, AND CAUTION, SLOW, SPEED LIMIT DOWN TO 10 TO 15 MILES PER HOUR. THE NEXT SLIDE IS KIND OF CONCENTRATES ON THE PARKING. THERE WAS A CONCERN THAT THE PARKING WOULD NOT BE SUFFICIENT. THE REQUIRED PARKING WAS 68. WE ARE PROVIDING 96 PARKING SPACES, OF WHICH 64 OF THOSE ARE GOING TO BE TOTALLY WITHIN THE -- WITHIN THE GARAGES, AND THEN WE HAVE 27 PUBLIC PARKING SPACES THAT ARE FOR GENERAL USE BY EVERYONE, INCLUDING THE EXISTING RESIDENTS FOR GUEST PARKING. SO WE HAVE TWO SPACES FOR EACH OF THESE NEW BUILDINGS WITHIN THE BUILDING THEMSELVES. WE HAVE ROOM IN FRONT OF THE GARAGE FOR 1 TO 2 CARS AS WELL. SO WE HAVE WAY MORE PARKING THAN WHAT IS REQUIRED. THE ADDITIONAL -- THERE WAS A QUESTION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THE BUILDINGS THEMSELVES WERE THE SAME SIZE OR LARGER THAN THE SINGLE FAMILY HOMES WERE. THESE ARE SLIGHTLY LARGER. THEY WERE MADE LARGER FOR THE TWO-CAR GARAGES, AND TO ACCOMMODATE THE STORAGE AND EVERY SINGLE GARAGE IS GOING TO HAVE A BIKE RACK IN THE GARAGE, AND THE OWNER HAS ADDED A TWO CLASS A BIKE RACKS IN FRONT OF THE EXI EXISTING RESIDENCES, THE EXISTING HOMES, AND BY THE DUMPSTER AREA SO THAT THE EXISTING RESIDENTS CAN USE THOSE BIKE RACKS AS WELL. THEY ARE DEDICATED TO THE EXIEXISTING RESIDENCES ON THE NH SIDE OF THE SITE. THE TRAFFIC IS -- WAS A CONCERN AS WELL OF A NUMBER OF THE RESIDENTS AND I'M GOING TO SKIP MOST OF THE STUFF ON THE TOP, BUT SEMCOG HAS ISSUED SOME GUYLINES ON THE STUDY -- GUIDELINES ON THE STUDY -- ON THE PARKING FOR THE PROJECT. THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT, INTERESTINGLY, WITH THE 19 HOME SITES, THEY PREDICT THAT 226 CAR MOVEMENTS PER DAY UNDER THE 19 HOME SITES GOING TO THE MULTIPLE, THEY EXPECT ONLY 225 5 TRIPS. THIS IS BECAUSE HOMES HAVE TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE PEOPLE LIVING IN THE HOMES WITH CHILDREN BEING TAKEN BACK AND FORTH, MULTIPLE HOMES ARE TYPICALLY ONE AND TWO TRAFFIC FACILITIES AND IT'S NOT NEARLY WHAT THE SINGLE FAMILY HOMES IS. VERY INTERESTING ANALYSIS IN THE TRAFFIC. NEXT SLIDE IS THE OPEN SPACE. I PRESENT THIS TO YOU BECAUSE THE AMOUNT OF OPEN SPACE EXCEEDS WHAT'S REQUIRED IN THE ZONING ORDINANCE. WE PROVIDE THE USABLE AND THE WETLAND OPEN SPACE REQUIRED BY THE CITY, AND WE HAVE MAINTAINED THE NATURAL FEATURES, THE PROPOSED -- THE FLOODPLAINS, THE WETLANDS HAVE ALL BEEN EITHER SAVED, MITIGATED AND DELINEATED AND APPROVED BY CITY STAFF. ONE OF THE ISSUES LAST MEETING WAS THE STORMWATER SYSTEM. AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THIS SLIDE, WE ARE COLLECTING THE STORMWATER FROM THE FRONT PORTION OF THE SITE OR THE NORTHERN PART, WHICH IS THE EXISTING CONDOMINIUM DEVELOPMENT THAT HAS BEEN CONSTRUCTED. WE ARE TAKING THAT, AS WELL AS ALL THE RUNOFF FROM THE SOUTHERLY PORTION OF THE SITE AND WE ARE WRAPPING IT BACK INTO THE FOUR BAY AND THE DETENTION BASIN AT THE SOUTHERLY END OF THE SITE. SO WE ARE DEALING WITH ALL THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE CITY. WE HAVE THE APPROVAL FROM THE WASHTENAW COUNTY DRAIN COMMISSIONER, WITH THE WATER RESOURCE COMMISSION, AND SO WE HAVE THAT. THE REASON FOR THE CHANGE IS THE DIVERSITY OF USE AND THE COST TO BE ABLE TO KEEP THOSE COSTS DOWN TO MAKE IT A MORE AFFORDABLE FOR THE FIRST-TIME H HOMEOWNERS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, COMMISSIONER.
00:19:54.689: >> Chair Milshteyn: WE WILL NOW GO OVER TO MR. CAAN FOR A STAFF REPORT.
00:19:59.927: >> THANK YOU. THE PETITIONER HAD REQUESTED POSTPONEMENT AT THE SEPTEMBER 4, 2019 PLANNING COMMISSION MEETING SINCE CRITICAL MEMBERS OF THEIR TEAM WERE NOT ABLE TO ATTEND THAT MEETING. THE STAFF REPORT DOES RECOMMEND APPROVAL BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IT COMPLIES WITH ALL THE APPLICABLE LOCAL, STATE AND FEDERAL ORDINANCES, STANDARDS AND REGULATIONS. IT WILL NOT CAUSE A PUBLIC OR PRIVATE NUISANCE AND WILL NOT HAVE A DETRIMENTAL EFFECT ON PUBLIC HEALTH SAFETY, OR WELFARE.
00:20:35.830: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU. I WOULD LIKE TO O UP THE PUBLIC HEARING. ANYONE WISHING TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION, PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS FOR THE RECORD. YOU HAVE UP TO THREE MINUTES.
00:20:48.409: >> HELLO, MY NAME IS ETHEL POTTS. ARE YOU HEARING ME? OKAY. WAY, WAY, BACK WHEN THIS WAS BEFORE THE PLANNING COMMISSION BEFORE, THERE WERE ISSUES ABOUT THE CREEK. IT'S AN IMPORTANT CREEK, A VERY IMPORTANT NATURAL FEATURE IN ANN ARBOR AND I DON'T REMEMBER WHETHER IT WAS THE EROSION OF THE BANKS INTO THE CREEK OR EROSION BY THE CREEK BY THE BANKS BUT THERE WERE SOME CONCERNS AT THAT POINT. HAVE ANY OF THOSE CONCERNS COME UP IN YOUR STAFF REPORTS? AND DO YOU HAVE ANY -- ANY KINDS OF PROBLEMS THAT NEED TO BE FIXED AT THIS POINT? SO I RAISE THAT ISSUE.
00:21:29.083: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU.
00:21:38.225: >> COMMISSION. MIKE GUSTAFSON. I LIVE ON HIDEAWAY LANE DRIVE WITH MY WIFE AND TWO YOUNG CHILDREN. WE FACE THE DRIVEWAY, WHICH IS BEING REGARDED AS THE ROAD TO TAKE ON JUST A LITTLE ABOUT 225 PIECES OF TRAFFIC A DAY. SO I BELIEVE THAT THAT'S ACTUALLY A LOT. AS MEMBERS THE COMMUNITY, AS CITIZENS OF ANN ARBOR, AS YOUR CONSTITUENTS, WE, THE COMMUNITY STRONGLY URGE YOU EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU TO REJECT THIS PETITION. OUR NUMBER ONE MAIN CAUSE AND REASON FOR THAT IS THE LARGE AMOUNT OF TRAFFIC, WHICH WE HAVE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT. 225 MORE CARS PER DAY OR TRAFFIC PER DAY IS SUBSTANTIAL, GIVEN THAT IT IS A VERY -- IT'S VERY TIGHT QUARTERS THERE. THERE ARE TWO POINTS OF ENTRY AND EXIT POINTS THAT ARE JUST 2. SO MANY OF US ARE CONCERNED ABOUT FIRE ENGINES GETTING IN THERE IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY. IT'S VERY TOUGH FOR TWO CARS TO GO AT THE SAME TIME. SO, AGAIN, WE FEEL THAT GIVEN THOSE DIMENSIONS, GIVING THE ACTUALITY THAT EMERGENCIES OCCUR, WE HAVE HAD A FEW ALREADY, WHERE LARGE FIRE ENGINES ARE THERE. AND THIS IS TALKING ABOUT GOING WAY BACK NOT FAR END WHERE THIS IS GOING TO BE PROPOSED. I FEEL THAT -- AND I SPEAK FOR THE COMMUNITY THAT THIS COULD BE VERY IRRESPONSIBLE AND VERY DANGEROUS IN A SENSE. WHAT IS MORE IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY, AGAIN, GETTING THE FIRE TRUCKS IN THIS FIRST ARE THE FIRST RESPONDERS BACK THERE, ALL THE WAY BACK THERE WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT AND POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS. AND NOW LET'S ALL TALK ABOUT THE LOCATION. THERE ARE, OF COURSE, NATURAL WETLANDS BACK THERE. IT'S A VERY WET AREA BACK THERE. I ENCOURAGE ALL OF YOU TO COME AND LOOK SOMETIME, EVEN AFTER A RAIN OR NOT EVEN A RAIN. IT'S VERY MOIST. OUR BASEMENT IS VERY MOIST AS WELL. VERY DAMP. THAT WILL BE TENFOLD WITH THIS. AND THEN THERE'S THE GREEN SPACE QUESTION, THE SITE SPACE. I SUBMIT TO THE COMMISSION THAT IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO PLANT TREES ON THIS PROPERTY. WE DON'T KNOW WHY. YOU CAN COME LOOK AT THE PROPERTY I HAVE RIGHT IN THE VERY FRONT OF THIS FORTUNATELY. SOME TREES ARE DEAD. THE DEVELOPER HAS RECENTLY PUT IN 10 NEW TREES, FIVE EVER WHICH ARE DEAD. SO I THINK THAT IS INDICATIVE OF THE VIABILITY OF THE LAND AND IN TERMS OF HOW THAT IMPACTS THIS GREEN SPACE THAT THEY ARE PROPOSING WITH ALL OF THESE TREES. WHEN YOU ARE LOOKING AT 50% DEAD TREES ALREADY, WHAT DOES THAT SAY TO US? THAT'S PRETTY SIGNIFICANT. SO, AGAIN BE, I ENCOURAGE EVERYBODY TO PLEASE COME AND TAKE A LOOK FOR YOURSELF. ITTHE SETUP AND THE ARRANGEMENT ARE NOT CONDUCIVE FOR LIVING WELL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU, COMMISSION.
00:24:27.194: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE?
00:24:40.508: >> GOOD EVENING, COMMISSION. MY NAME IS JOSEPH PRATT. I'M FROM -- WELL, I LIVE PART TIME AT 1790 HIDEAWAY LANE DRIVE, AND PART TIME AT 3092 WOLVERINE DRIVE OVER BY COLONIAL SQUARE. ANYWAY, THIS THING IS USELESS. I'M GOING TO PUT IT IN AGAIN. I CAME TO THE LAST MEETING AND PUT IT IN. I DIDN'T FIND OUT ABOUT THIS MEETING UNTIL TODAY, AND IT WASN'T ON THE AGENDA. I CHECKED YESTERDAY. AND WHAT'S THE DEAL? I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO GET AN EMAIL. ANYWAY, THAT THAT'S THAT. SO I WOULD LIKE TO MAYBE -- MAYBE YOU COULD SHED SOME INSIGHT ON YOUR PEOPLE THAT SEND THESE THINGS OUT. OKAY. SO ANYWAY, IN TERMS OF THE TRAFFIC ISSUE. OKAY. SO WE ARE GOING TO INCREASE TO 226 CARS GOING THROUGH THIS LITTLE NARROW DRIVEWAY EVERY DAY. OKAY, THE DRIVEWAY, IT'S TRUE. IT SITS WITHIN THE CODE. COOL. BUT I DON'T KNOW. I JUST HAVE TROUBLE IMAGINING ALL OF THESE CARS COMING IN AND OUT AND TWO-WAY, YOU KNOW. IT'S NOT JUST ONE-WAY. SO, YOU KNOW, THESE AREN'T JUST LITTLE CARS. A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE SUVsEN SUVD LARGER CARS NOW. IT WILL BE A MESS SOMETIMES. I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. I'M CONCERNED ABOUT NOT EVERYBODY DRIVES SLOW. SO -- AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST -- THAT'S JUST A FACT AND SO IT'S KIND OF DANGEROUS FOR KIDS, ESPECIALLY IN A NARROW AREA LIKE THAT. I REALLY THINK IT WOULD BE GREAT. ALL OF YOU DIDN'T COME DOWN AND CHECK IT OUT AND, YOU KNOW, SEE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. THERE'S A CURVED DRIVEWAY. IT'S SUBTLE. I THINK IT INFLUENCES THE WAY THAT, YOU KNOW, THE PIECES -- THE CARS CAN FIT IN THAT SPACE. AND GO BY EACH OTHER. SO I THINK THAT'S -- THAT'S STILL A VERY DEFINITE CONCERN. AND SO IT WOULD BE GREAT IF YOU COULD LOOK INTO IT, CHECK IT OUT FOR YOURSELF. ALSO THIS DEAL WITH THE TREES, YOU KNOW, THE DEVELOPER PUT IN THESE TREES TWO OR THREE MONTHS AGO. AND HALF OF THEM ARE DEAD ALREADY! NOW, I UNDERSTAND THAT THE TREES WERE PUT IN PARTLY TO -- TO GET -- MAKE HIS QUOTA FOR THE AMOUNT OF FOOTAGE OF LUMBER THAT IS GROWING IN THE AREA. WELL, IT'S DEAD ALREADY. WHAT IS HE DOING? HE'S NOT PUTTING IN NEW TREES. SO LIKE MIKE SAID, THE LAND DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS TYPE OF THING OR THE DEVELOPER IS CARELESS AND IS NOT DOING A GOOD JOB. AND SO I'M WONDERING, YOU KNOW, THIS HOUSE, THIS SINGLE-FAMILY HOUSE THAT'S THERE NOW. IT'S A DERELICT HOUSE. THEY POLISHED IT UP A LITTLE BIT, BUT IT'S BEEN THERE FOR FOUR YEARS. RAIN IN THE WINDOWS WHO IS GOING TO BUY THAT THING? IF THEY BUY IT, THEY ARE GETTING RIPPED OFF. IT'S IRRESPONSIBLE. AND I WANT TO KNOW THAT THAT DEVELOPER IS GOING TO BE RESPONSIBLE AND IF THEY ARE GOING TO DO IT, THEY ARE GOING TO DO IT RIGHT. THANK YOU.
00:27:48.228: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION IN REGARDS TO THIS ITEM? SEEING NO ONE, I WILL CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING. AND I WILL READ THE MOTION. THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION HEREBY RECOMMENDS THAT THE MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL APPROVE THE HIDEAWAY LANE PLANNED PROJECT SITE PLAN AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT. MOVED BY COMMISSIONER, SAUVE, SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL. WE ARE IN DISCUSSION. COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL?
00:28:23.530: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: MAY I HAVE THE ENGINEER COME UP TO THE PODIUM, PLEASE.
00:28:30.604: >> YES, MA'AM.
00:28:31.038: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: COULD YOU DESCRIBE WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THE 100 YEAR FLOODPLAIN. IT SEEMS AWFULLY CLOSE TO SOME OF THE UNITS. TRAVER CREEK IS PRETTY FLASHY. IT'S ONE OF THE FEW CREEKS THAT ACTUALLY FLOWS THROUGH NASH NOT IN A PIPE -- ANN ARBOR NOT IN A PIPE. I SEE YOU HAVE A WHOLE STORMWATER SYSTEM, BUT PERHAPS YOU COULD GO TO ONE OF YOUR SHEETS THAT SHOWS A SHOWS WHEREE 100-YEAR LINE IS. I DON'T THINK IT'S ON THE LANDSCAPE. IT'S ON A DIFFERENT SHEET. IT KIND OF KICKS IN A LITTLE BIT ON THE EAST -- ON THE EAST SIDE WHEN I WAS LOOKING AT IT.
00:29:13.347: >> YES, SHEET NUMBER NINE PROBABLY IS THE BEST ONE OUT OF 13, JEFF. BACK UP A LITTLE BIT MORE. THERE YOU GO.
00:29:29.096: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: THERE. YEAH.
00:29:32.166: >> ALL RIGHT. FIRST OF ALL, WHEN WE ESTABLISHED -- WE HAVE TO ESTABLISH WHERE THAT FLOODPLAIN IS. AND ONCE WE KNOW THAT FLOODPLAIN, ALL THE HABITABLE AND ALL THE LIVING SPACES, ALL THE ROADWAYS AND ALL THE STORM SEWERS HAVE TO BE DESIGNED FROM THAT FLOODPLAIN. SO WE CAN'T ENCROACH UPON THAT FLOODPLAIN AND WE CAN'T LET THAT FLOOD PLAIN COME BACK INTO ANY OF THE HABITABLE SPACES, PARKING SPACES, ROADS. AND SO WE ARE FOUR TO FIVE FEET ABOVE THE FLOODPLAIN IN THESE STRUCTURES, AND -- AND WE ARE -- OUR STORM SEWER OUTLETS THROUGH STORM SEWER PIPING, EECIALLY FROM THE EAST, WE HAVE WATER THAT FLOWS TOWARDS THIS PROPERTY FROM THE EAST. THERE'S A WETLAND YOU CAN SEE THERE ALONG THE EAST PROPERTY LINE. WE WERE REQUIRED TO RUN SO MUCH RUNOFF TO THAT WETLAND TO HYDRATE THAT WETLAND ALONG THE EAST PROPERTY LINE THERE, HOWEVER WE HAVE A STORM SEWER THEN THAT PICKS UP THAT EXCESS FLOW, ONCES IT GETS TO A CERTAIN ELEVATION, IT FLOWS AROUND THE EASTERLY SIDE, AND ALONG THE SOUTHERLY SIDE, AND ON THE PROPERTY, THROUGH A STORM SEWER AND OUTLETTING TO THE FILTERED PONDS THERE YOU SEE ON EACH SIDE OF THE ROAD TRESTLE, THE RAILROAD TRESTLE STORM SEWER. THAT'S PICKING UP THE UNDEVELOPED, RUNOFF. IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SITE, WE HAVE THE STORM SEWER THAT'S PICKING UP ALL THE ROAD WATER, ALL THE BUILDING WATER. WE ARE RUNNING IT BACK TO A FOUR BAY AND A DETENTION BASIN AND THEN IT SLOWLY D D DRAINS IT DON INTO THE CREEK AFTER IT'S FILTERED. BUT THE FLOODPLAIN ITSELF STAYS WITHIN THE CREEK ITSELF AND WE HAVE ACCOMMODATED ALL OF THAT, AND THE WASHTENAW COUNTY WRC HAS APPROVED THE DESIGN AND WE ARE NOT IMPACTING THE FLOODPLAIN WHATSOEVER FOR THIS DESIGN.
00:31:30.417: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: SO MY CONCERN IS MORE -- SO ON THIS SCREEN THAT I'M SEEING, THERE'S A LINE. IT'S A LITTLE VAGUE ON THE SCREEN HERE, THAT SHOWS IT -- A LINE AROUND TRAVER CREEK. IS THAT THE 100 YEAR ELEVATION THERE? IS THAT WHAT I'M SEEING?
00:31:48.869: >> YOU CAN SEE THE -- IT'S A DARK --
00:31:51.205: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: RIGHT.
00:31:52.105: >> IT'S KIND OF THE DARK IMAGE AROUND THERE.
00:31:54.708: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: WHOEVER IS MOVING THE CURSOR. PLEASE, YOU SEE THE LITTLE TRIANGLE. I GET IT THAT YOU ARE 4 FEET ABOVE.
00:32:05.185: >> YES.
00:32:05.452: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: HOWEVER, TRAVER CREEK IS ACTIVELY ERODING IN MANY PLACES AND SO WHAT I WOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT IS THAT YOU MAY BE HIGH ENOUGH BUT IF THESE -- THE SIDES OF CREEK CONTINUE TO EN INSIZE D CAVE HORIZONTALLY SPEAKING THAT, FOUNDATION IS REALLY CLOSE TO THE FLOODPLAIN. ISN'T THERE SOME SORT OF SETBACK FROM THE FLOODPLAIN THAT IS HORIZONTAL SPACE, NOT JUST VERTICAL SPACE.
00:32:35.249: >> THERE ISN'T AND YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE. I'M SURE YOU UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE 100 YEAR FLOODPLAIN, THE FLOODWAY AND THE NORMAL FLOW OF THE RIVER ITSELF.
00:32:45.058: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: SURE. RIGHT.
00:32:46.193: >> SO THE NORMAL KNOW IS SUBSTANTIALLY BELOW THE 100 YEAR FLOODPLAIN. THE FLOODP FLOO FLOODPLAIN IS WE WATER BACKS UP, BUT IT DOESN'T ERODE AWAY. ALL THAT DOES IS BACK UP INTO IT. THE FLOODWAY CARRIES THE SILT AND EVERYTHING WITH IT, BUT IT STAYS WITHIN THE LINE. THE NEXT INTERNAL LINE TO THAT NEXT HEAVY LINE AND IT'S WHERE THE WATER ACTUALLY FLOWS PAST THAT AREA. SO THE FLOODPLAIN HAD TO BE DEALT WITH BECAUSE YOU CAN'T LET WATER BACK KNEW HABITABLE SPACE OR USABLE AREAS BUT THE FLOODWAY IT WHAT ERODES THE SHORELINE. THIS PARTICULAR PLAN HAS -- AND THERE IS A DIMENSION THERE AND I APOLOGIZE, WHAT THAT DIMENSION IS, BETWEEN THE FLOODWAY AND THE -- I APOLOGIZE. I CAN'T READ THAT EITHER BUT THERE'S A SETBACK BETWEEN THE BUILDING AND THE FLOODWAY THERE. AND IT'S NOT THAT LITTLE FINGER THAT STICKS UP ADJACENT TO BUILDING BUILDING 15. AND APOLOGIZE. I CAN'T READ THAT.
00:33:58.632: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: HANG ON A SECOND. THANK YOU.
00:34:01.335: >> CAN YOU ZOOM IN ON THAT?
00:34:03.203: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: I GET IT. IT'S HERE. SO -- I GOT IT ON BOTH SIDES. I'M IN STEREO.
00:34:16.983: >> THIS IS THE FLOODWAY LINE.
00:34:18.385: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: NO, I GET IT. USUALLY THERE'S A KINK IN THERE FOR A REASON IN TERMS OF HOW THESE THINGS FLOW AND WHERE WATER HAS BEEN CONCENTRATING IN THE PAST AND WHERE THE IT GOES WITH STREAM MORPHOLOGY. WHEN I SEE THAT'S REALLY CLOSE, IT MEANS THERE'S HISTORY IN THAT KINK. THAT'S WHY IT'S THERE.
00:34:35.869: >> YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT.
00:34:37.003: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: AND SO IT JUST MAKES ME A LITTLE -- I KNOW PEOPLE HAVE REVIEWED AND THAT TYPE OF THING, SO I WORK WITH WATER A LOT. IT MAKES ME NERVOUS TO SEE HOW CLOSE THAT THING IS TO THAT BUILDING.
00:34:49.182: >> I APPRECIATE THAT.
00:34:49.883: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: USUALLY PEOPLE SET IT BACK A LITTLE BIT AND FRANKLY, YOU KNOW, CLIMATE CHANGE IS HAPPENING WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT.
00:34:56.890: >> YES.
00:34:57.157: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: I THINK WE JUST SEE MORE AND MORE OF THESE BIGGER EVENTS AND SO I'M NOT TOTALLY MOLLIFIED IT WILL ONLY HAPPEN, YOU KNOW, ONCE EVERY 100 YEARS AND IT WILL STAND STILL IN THAT AREA. SO THAT JUST GIVES ME A LITTLE PAUSE HERE TO SEE THAT. I KNOW IT'S BEEN REVIEWED BY STAFF. SO I APPRECIATE THAT. AND PERHAPS MR. KAHAN, YOU COULD ILLUMINATE ABOUT THIS. WHEN THE WATER RESOURCE OFFICE IS REVIEWING THIS ARE THEY LOOKING MOSTLY AT THE STORMWATER. WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WHOLE RELATIONSHIP TO THE CREEK, NOT IN TERMS OF STORMWATER OUTLETS AND THE DEVELOPMENT RELATIONSHIP TO THE CREEK SETBACKS, ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF? IS THAT MORE STAFF OR WASHTENAW --
00:35:51.111: >> RIGHT. WE HAVE A STAFF MEMBER, TESTIFYY JACOBAZI. SHE DID CONDUCT THE MOST RECENT REVIEW OF THE PLAN. KERRY GRAY LOOKED AT IT ORIGINALLY. STORMWATER MAY BE REVIEWED BY THE COUNTY RESOURCE COMMISSION, DEPENDING WHETHER IT MEETS THE TRIP THRESHOLD.
00:36:24.144: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: RIGHT.
00:36:25.078: >> AND THAT WAS THE CASE HERE. WE DO HAVE PEOPLE LOOKING AT THE NATURAL FEATURES, FOR SURE.
00:36:31.351: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: I UNDERSTAND YOUR STORMWATER APPROACH. I TOTALLY -- I GET IT. THAT MAKES SENSE TO ME. AND THAT YOU ARE HANDLING IT THE WAY YOU ARE. THIS IS COMING IN DOWNSTREAM. BUILDING AND I GET THE OFFSITE STUFF. THAT CHECKS IN WITH ME AND I JUST SEE THIS VERY CLOSE SPATIAL RELATIONSHIP, AND IT JUST MAKES ME A LITTLE -- YOU KNOW, IT MAKES ME A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THAT.
00:36:57.744: >> WHEN I WALK THE SITE, I DID NOTICE THAT THE NORTHERN PORTION OF THE PROPERTY FLOWS TOWARDS THE CREEK ALONG THE NORTHERN PORTION. THE SOUTHERN PORTION WITH THE RAILROAD TRACKS THIS FLOWS TOWARDS THE SOUTHERN PARCEL. THE WETLAND TO THE NORTH, HOWEVER, I MEAN, TO THE EAST, I APOLOGIZE TO THE EAST, PRIOR TO ANY PAVEMENT BEING PUT IN BEFORE THE STORM SEWER WAS PUT IN, IT APPEARS, BASED UPON THE OLD TOPO THAT IT MIGRATED DOWN THROUGH THE CENTER OF THIS SITE AND THEN OVERFLOWED THE EMBANKMENT DOWN THROUGH THE CENTER OF THIS SITE. SO WITH THE STORM SEWER THAT WAS PUT IN AND THE PROPOSED NEW STORM SEWER SYSTEM, I DON'T EXPECT ANY WATER ALL CONTINUING THAT PATH DOWN THROUGH THE CENTER OF THE PROJECT. I THINK THAT'S HOW THAT HILL KEY WAS CREATED THERE ON THE -- THAT LITTLE KEY WAS CREATED THERE ON THE SITE GIBB.
00:37:53.967: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: IT'S FORMER FLOW THAT WAS BISECONDING THE SITE.
00:38:00.740: >> THAT'S CORRECT.
00:38:01.207: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: AND SO IT'S YOUR BELIEF THAT YOU ALL HAVE ALTERED THE SITE TOPOGRAPHY THAT THAT PATTERN NO LONGER EXISTS AND THAT'S LEFT OVER FROM AN OLD PATTERN, DOESN'T NECESSARILY --
00:38:16.022: >> THAT'S CORRECT. AND WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO FILL IT IN. WE HAVE TO MAINTAIN IT.
00:38:20.660: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: NO. AND THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU WANT TO DO BUT THAT DOES HELP SORT OF EXPLAIN WHY THIS THING COULD BE THERE BECAUSE IT JUST SEEMS AWFULLY CLOSE TO ME.
00:38:29.703: >> CORRECT.
00:38:31.171: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: IT STILL SEEMS CLOSE TO ME, I GUESS. JUST IN THIS DAY AND AGE, IT FEELS A LITTLE CLOSE TO ME. ONE OTHER QUESTION. PAVEMENTS. YOU ARE RIGHT NEXT TO THE CREEK. SO WHERE IS GROUNDWATER HERE?
00:38:45.885: >> GREAT QUESTION. I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO, THAT BUT I KNOW THAT THE BOTTOM OF THOSE BASEMENTS ARE STILL ABOVE THE CREEK ELEVATION. AND THERE'S NO -- THERE'S NO TIE AT ALL TO THE BASEMENTS TO THE CREEK OR TO THE FLOODPLAIN. EACH OF THE BASEMENTS WILL HAVE THEIR OWN SUMP PUMP AND SO THEY WILL BE TOTALLY INDEPENDENT OF -- OF THE RISE IN THAT POND OR THAT CREEK. I HAVE NEVER SEEN WATER IN THOSE BASEMENTS. CAN I TURN TO THE OWNER, HAVE YOU EVER SEEN WATER IN THOSE BASEMENTS AT ALL? THIS IS MR. TONY RANDAZO.
00:39:20.387: >> ACTUALLY WE NEVER HAVE AND WE DUG DOWN BELOW THE BASEMENTS BECAUSE WE NEEDED TO BE ON SOME OF THE -- SOME OF THE GROUND HAD BEEN -- IT WAS KIND OF ORGANIC, AND WE NEVER ENCOUNTERED ANY WATER WHATSOEVER. AND ALL THE SOIL BORINGS WE HAVE ARE CLAY AND AS YOU KNOW, IT'S A NATURAL BARRIER. IT'S NOT SANDY WHICH IS PREFERRED WHEN YOU BUILD BUT THIS HAPPENS TO BE ALL CLAY. I HAVE NOT NOTICED ANY WATER WHATSOEVER.
00:39:43.376: >> SO YOU REMOVED A BUNCH OF ORGANIC SOILS BASICALLY. IN ORDER TO BUILD THE BASEMENTS.
00:39:48.915: >> WHATEVER WAS THERE ORIGINALLY, YOU KNOW, YOU GO DOWN TO HARD SOIL.
00:39:52.552: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: RIGHT.
00:39:54.087: >> AND SOME OF THE SOIL WAS A LITTLE BIT LOOSE. SO WE TOOK THE LIBERTY OF GOING DOWN KEEPER AND CHARGING IT WITH STONE BUT WE NOTICED NO WATER.
00:40:03.363: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: SO RAIN WATER COMING IN AND NOT SEEPING IN THROUGH THE WALLS.
00:40:09.836: >> BECAUSE IT'S CLAY, IT'S A NATURAL BARRIER.
00:40:13.306: >> I HAVE A COUNTER OBSERVATION.
00:40:15.208: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: SO I GUESS THAT'S ONE BASEMENT. SO SEE HOW IT GOES, IF THINGS MOVE ALONG HERE, JUST BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, COMPRESSIVE OR GAPPIC SOILS NEXT TO A CREEK IS SUPER COMMON AND THOSE SEAMS AND GLACI ATIAN, IT'S RANDOM. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IF THERE'S A PLAN IF THEY ENCOUNTER THE GROUNDWATER WHEN THEY ARE DIGGING AND WHAT THE CITY PLANS TO DO WITH THAT, BU BUT I GUESS IT'S ALL SUMPS. THE SUMPS WILL GO OFF.
00:40:52.512: >> THEY CAN COME BACK AND PROPOSE AN AMENDMENT TO THE PLAN, TO RESPOND TO A CONDITION LIKE THAT BUT THEY HAVE TO DO THAT BEFORE THEY BUILD.
00:41:06.559: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: THAT TYPE OF EVALUATION WOULD HAPPEN BEFORE C OF O IN TERMS OF WATER ISSUES AND THINGS LIKE THAT.
00:41:15.602: >> OKAY.
00:41:16.102: >> WHAT TYPICALLY HAPPENS WHEN YOU BUILD A SUBDIVISION AND YOU PUT IN SUMP PUMPS. IT DEWATERS IT. WHEN YOU HAVE WET SOILS, THEY PUT POINT WELLS IN TO DEWATER THAT AREA TO PUT THE PIPE IN. SO P PSUMP PUMPS WORK THE SAME . THEY TAKE UP EXCESS WATER. I FOUND THAT TO BE ESPECIALLY PREVALENT IN SANDY SOILS BUT THIS PARTICULAR SITE IS CLAY. I HAVE NOTICED NO VARIATION BUT WE WOULD CERTAINLY ADDRESS IT WHEN -- THE BUILDING DEPARTMENT IS VERY ASTUTE AND WE WOULD ADDRESS THAT IF IT CAME UP, BUT I DON'T ANTICIPATE ANY OF THAT.
00:41:58.878: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: ALL RIGHTY. I'M DONE FOR NOW.
00:42:01.714: >> Chair Milshteyn: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN.
00:42:05.285: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR. SO I WANT TO FOLLOW ON THAT SAME LINE OF QUESTIONING. AS THE FOUNDATIONS ARE DUG AND SHOULD YOU FIND GROUNDWATER, WHOSE DETERMINATION IS IT THAT THEY NEED TO AMEND THE SITE PLAN? IS THAT OUR DETERMINATION OR THEY ARE ABLE TO -- I MEAN, IF THEY CLAIM THEY CAN MITIGATE THE ISSUE OF A SUMP PUMP, IS THAT -- IS THAT ALLOWED OR IS THERE SOME TRIGGER THAT THEY WOULD NEED TO COME BACK AND AMEND?
00:42:32.979: >> TYPICALLY IN A SITUATION WHERE GROUNDWATER HAS SHIFTED FROM THE TIME THAT THEY DID THE ORIGINAL SOIL BORINGS, IT MAY RESULT IN A DECISION TO NOT GO WITH A BASEMENT, TO BE ON A SLAB. BUT THEY WOULD TYPICALLY WORK WITH THE BUILDING DEPARTMENT TO TRY TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE. IF IT'S PARTICULARLY SEVERE AND THEY CHOOSE TO NOT DEVELOP IN ONE PARTICULAR PORTION OF THE SITE, THEY COULD COME BACK AND PROPOSE AN AMENDMENT TO THE SITE PLAN TO SHIFT UNITS AROUND OR EVEN ELIMINATE UNITS.
00:43:16.089: >> Councilmember Ackerman: OKAY. THANK YOU. AND THEN COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL, I WAS HOPING YOU WOULD ASK ABOUT THE TREES. SO I WILL DO MY BEST. [ OFF MICROPHONE COMMENT ] I GUESS I WILL ASK AN OPENING QUESTION ABOUT TREATS AND IF YOU HAVE ANY FOLLOW-ONS I WOULD ENCOURAGE IT. WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE TREES?
00:43:34.774: >> WE JUST PLANTED SOME AND THE ONES WE DID PLANT, LIKE -- AND I WILL TELL YOU, WE DIDN'T HAVE AN IRRIGATION SYSTEM. SO THEY WERE KIND OF LEFT THERE, BUT WHEN WE PICKED THEM UP TO REPLAN THEY ALREADY ROOTED. THEY WERE DOING GREAT. SO WHEN WE HAD OUR REVIEW TO GET THIS CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY, TIFFANY HAD -- THERE WERE SOME TREES WE HAD TO PLANT LIKE THE NEW ONES SO WE PUT SOME DOGWOODS IN AND THEY ARE BRAND NEW. AND THE OTHER ONES WHEN I MOVED THEM IN THE CORRECT LOCATION, BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO BE IN A SPECIFIC SPOT, THE LITTLE ROOTS HAD ALREADY CLIMBED OUT OF THE BURLAP BAG. THEY WERE DOING VERY, VERY WELL. THAT'S MAYBE NOT THE RIGHT TERMINOLOGY, BUT THEY WERE GROWING. AND -- BUT WHEN WE DO PLANT TREES, WE PLANT THEM WITH TOPSOIL, AND YOU MAKE SURE THEY ARE PLANTED HIGH ABOVE AND I LEARNED THAT THEY NOW HAVE RAIN BAGS. SO WHEN YOU HAVE A DRY SUMMER AND YOU DON'T HAVE AN IRRIGATION SYSTEM, YOU PUT A BAG AND FILL IT UP WITH WATER AND IT IRRIGATES IT. SO WE HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED THAT ISSUE. AS A MATTER OF FACT, WE HAVE THE OPPOSITE ISSUE. IT'S GOING VERY WELL.
00:44:50.016: >> Councilmember Ackerman: OKAY.
00:44:51.250: >> THANK YOU.
00:44:52.085: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THAT'S ABOUT AS FAR AS I CAN GO ON THE TREES, BUT I WILL INVITE OTHER COLLEAGUES WHO MAY BE EXPERTS IN THE FIELD TO ASK FOLLOW-ON QUESTIONS. WANT TO TURN TO THE TRAFFIC. THE ESTIMATION OF 225 TRIPS A DAY, THOSE CALCULATIONS, ARE THEY PRODUCED BY -- BASED ON THE NUMBER OF UNITS OR NUMBER OF PARKING SPACES?
00:45:13.906: >> THOSE ARE BASED UPON THE NUMBER OF UNITS AND THE USE OF THOSE UNITS AND IT'S STRAIGHT, STANDARD RIGHT FROM THE CHARTS AND THE SEMCOG AND ANASTO CHARTS.
00:45:29.322: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  SO ASSUMING EVERY PARKING SPACE IS UTILIZED BY TENANTS. YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT 2.3 TRIPS PER CAR PER DAY. YOU ARE SAYING SOMEONE LEAVES AND SOMEONE COMES BACK, SOMEONE LEAVES IN THE MORNING AND SOMEONE COMES BACK IN THE EVENING AND THEN ANOTHER THIRD OF THOSE CARS MIGHT MAKE A TRIP TO THE GROCERY STORE.
00:45:49.475: >> YES, IT'S TRIPS FROM THE UNIT, NOT THE NUMBER OF PARKING SPACES. THAT IS CORRECT.
00:45:54.180: >> Councilmember Ackerman: OKAY.
00:45:55.048: >> I MIGHT ALSO ADD, I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE COMMISSION AND CERTAINLY THE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDS THAT THE EXISTING APPROVED RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT PROPOSES TO GENERATE 226 TRIPS PER DAY.
00:46:09.562: >> Councilmember Ackerman: MM-HMM.
00:46:10.797: >> THE MODIFICATION TO DUPLEXES PROPOSES 225 TRIPS, NOT MORE TRIPS PER DAY. LESS TRIPS THAN THE EXISTING APPROVED RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT AS IT CURRENTLY STANDS.
00:46:22.708: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  I APPRECIATE THAT. THE REDUCTION OF ONE TRIP A DAY OFF OF, YOU KNOW, A HYPOTHETICAL DEVELOPMENT, I GUESS, IS APPRECIATED. I THINK WHEN YOU LISTEN TO THE CONCERNS OF RESIDENTS 225 TRIPS A DAY STILL SOUNDS LIKE A LOT AND THEY ARE TRYING TO PICTURE WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE DRIVING IN FRONT OF MY HOUSE, YOU KNOW, IN FRONT OF MY SIDEWALK. AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO COME TO TERMS WITH. WHAT DOES THAT ACTUALLY LOOK LIKE IN TERMS OF PEOPLE COMING AND LEAVING THROUGHOUT THE DAY.
00:46:54.841: >> I DO HAVE I ASUGGESTION. -- A SUGGESTION. WE COULD PUT UP SIGNAGE AND SPEED BUMPS TO HELP ALLEVIATE THE SITUATION.
00:47:07.386: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  I WOULD LOOK TO STAFF FOR THE UTILITY OF THAT. WOULD YOU BE SUGGESTING FUNDING TRAFFIC TALL. -- TRAFFIC TALL. ING IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD.
00:47:17.830: >> IF YOU GO DOWN TRAVER -- ZACK
00:47:20.500: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  I MEAN, LET'S NOT GET MARRIED TO SPEED BUMPS.
00:47:34.147: >> WHATEVER HELPS THE NEIGHBORHOOD, WHY NOT?
00:47:38.317: >> Councilmember Ackerman: COULD WE TALK TO STAFF TO FOLLOW UP OPEN WHAT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL TO NEIGHBORING PROPERTIES? AND THEN MY OTHER QUESTION IS A FIRE ACCESS. A MEMBER BROUGHT UP THE FIRST RESPONDERS. IT'S THE AMBULANCES AND PARTICULARLY THE FIRE TRUCKS. IF WE COULD GO BACK TO THE SITE PLAN, CAN WE TALK ABOUT WHAT THE MOVEMENTS ARE FOR -- FOR OUR FIRE DEPARTMENT, GIVEN THE NARROW SUB STREETS?
00:48:11.584: >> YES. YES, I WOULD. OH, GO AHEAD.
00:48:15.254: >> WHY DON'T Y START.
00:48:17.723: >> AND CERTAINLY WE WERE REQUIRED TO OBVIOUSLY HAVE THE FIRE MARSHAL REVIEW THIS PLAN AT LENGTH AND ONE OF THE REQUIREMENTS WAS -- AND I APOLOGIZE, PROBABLY THE BEST PLAN IS PAGE 4. THERE YOU GO. SO THE UPPER PLAN SHOWS THE WAY IT'S CURRENTLY PLANNED. AND THE ORIGINAL PLAN HAD A TURNAROUND FOR THE FIRE DEPARTMENT BETWEEN THE TWO UNITS AT THE SOUTHEAST CORNER OF THE SITE, UP HEADING TOWARDS THE RAILROAD TRACKS THERE. DUE TO THE CODE CHANGES AND THE WORKING WITH THE FIRE MARSHAL, THAT OPPORTUNITY NO LONGER EXISTED AND WHAT WAS REQUIRED WAS DOWN IN THE LOWER -- THE LOWER PLAN. IS A TOTALLY INDEPENDENT DRIVE COMING AT THE END OF THAT DRIVE RIGHT THERE, GOING IN. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT REQUIRED US TO DO THE TURNING RADIUS STUDIES AND HAVE A DEDICATED DRIVE BACK IN TOWARDS THE TRACKS BEING BETWEEN THOSE TWO UNITS RIGHT THROUGH THERE AND IT'S A DEDICATED DRIVE AND IT MEETS ALL THE NFPA, THE NATIONAL FIRE PROTECTION ASSOCIATION REQUIREMENTS DEDICATED SPECIFICALLY FOR FIRE. YOU CAN'T HAVE ANY PARKING OR ANYTHING IN IT. ALSO TO ELIMINATE A CONCERN THAT THE FIRE MARSHAL HAD, WAS THAT GETTING BACK IN THERE, AND HAVING ROOM TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE IMMEDIATE FIRE PROTECTION, THE FIRE MARSHAL REQUIRED THE SOUTHERLY 18 UNITS TO BE FIRE SUPPRESSED. SO THOSE APARTMENTS ALL HAVE TOO THE UNIT, SO THAT IT GIVES THE FIRE DEPARTMENT JUST THAT LITTLE BIT MORE TIME TO BE ABLE TO GET SET UP AT THE END OF THE SYSTEM THERE. SO THIS PLAN HAS BEEN REVIEWED AND APPROVED BY THE FIRE MARSHAL.
00:50:31.190: >> Councilmember Ackerman: OKAY.
00:50:32.491: >> ONE OTHER FEATURE, WE ARE ALSO REQUIRED AND WE DID IT VOLUNTARILY TO PUT A SHAFT WALL, A 2-INCH SHAFT WALL BETWEEN UNITS, WHICH IS A THICK, YOU KNOW, DRY WALL AND IT'S VERY EFFECTIVE BECAUSE WE SPECIALIZE IN MULTIFAMILY. AND IN THE EVENT THERE WAS A FIRE EVENT, IT PREVENTS IT FROM GOING TO THE NEXT UNIT.
00:50:52.678: >> Councilmember Ackerman: OKAY. THAT'S VERY HELPFUL. THANK YOU. I THINK THOSE ARE MY QUESTIONS FOR NOW. SO THANK YOU. OH, AND I WILL JUST SAY ABOUT THE FENCE, THANK YOU. THAT WAS VERY RESPONSIVE OF YOU. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE NEIGHBORS AND WE REQUESTED AT THE LAST MEETING. I APPRECIATE YOU PUTTING UP THAT FENCING QUICKLY.
00:51:19.171: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER BRIGGS.
00:51:20.539: >> Commissioner Briggs: WITH REGARDS TO THE TREES, IF NEIGHBORS SHOULD SEE ONGOING ISSUES WITH THEM, IS THERE A RECOURSE THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE?
00:51:29.949: >> YES. IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT IF A TREE IS SHOWN ON A SITE PLAN, IT NEEDS TO BE THERE IN PERPETUITY. SO IF VEGETATION DIES, THAT HAPPENS TO BE SHOWN ON THE SITE PLAN. THE OWNERS OF THE PROPERTY WOULD NEED TO REPLACE THE TREE. WE DO RESPOND TO COMPLAINTS, AND SO IF -- IF NEIGHBORS FELT THAT THERE WAS SOME DIE-OFF, THEY COULD CERTAINLY CONTACT OUR OFFICE AND WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO CONTACT THE OWNERS AND ASK THEM TO REPLACE THE DEAD TREES.
00:52:04.650: >> Commissioner Briggs: THANKS. AND ALSO I APPRECIATE THE RESPONSES TO ALL THE QUESTIONS THAT CAME UP AT THE LAST MEETING AND THE RESPONSIVENESS TO THE FENCE. I MADE THE RECOMMENDATION THAT MAYBE A NEIGHBORHOOD MEETING MIGHT HAVE BEEN USEFUL. I CONTINUE TO THINK IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN USEFUL. I THINK THE LAST THING YOU WANT TO SEE IS FOLKS COMING OUT AGAINST A PROJECT, AS YOU KNOW, AT A MEETING AND I WONDER IF MANY OF THE QUESTIONS THAT GOT RAISED TONIGHT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO -- SOME OF THEM, AT LEAST MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BE ADDRESSED IN A NEIGHBORHOOD MEETING AND SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS ALLEVIATED OR NOT. MAYBE NOT. I'M EVER THE OPTIMIST. BUT THANKS.
00:52:47.560: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER SAUVE.
00:52:52.331: >> Commissioner Sauve: SMALL THINGS, I THINK. FOR THE PARKING CALCULATION, I KNOW YOU ARE WELL OVER. ARE YOU COUNTING THE STACKED PARKING IN FRONT OF THE GARAGES IN THAT NUMBER? LIKE, WE LOOKED AT THOSE IN VARIOUS WAYS ON SEPARATE PROJECTS IN TERMS OF FORMALLY AND INFORMALLY COUNTING IT. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE NUMBERS --
00:53:12.885: >> THE NUMBERS PROVIDED YOU TO DO NOT INCLUDE ANY STACKING IN FRONT OF THE GARAGES. SO --
00:53:18.791: >> Commissioner Sauve: THEY DON'T?
00:53:20.092: >> THEY DO NOT. THE STACKING IN FRONT OF THE GARAGES IS ALL EXTRA. IF SOMEBODY HAS A PARTY OR GUESTS COMING OVER, THEY CAN PULL IN IN FRONT OF THE GARAGE --
00:53:28.934: >> Commissioner Sauve: AND BLOCK IT?
00:53:30.536: >> AND IT'S TOTALLY INDEPENDENT OF THE --
00:53:33.205: >> Commissioner Sauve: THE 96 OR WHATEVER. OKAY. SO WE HAVE THE 18 UNITS TIMES 4, RIGHT, THE DOUBLE CAR GARAGE AND DOUBLE --
00:53:43.048: >> NOT QUITE. ONLY BECAUSE WE HAVE A SINGLE FAMILY HOME THERE. SO THAT ONLY HAS TWO AND THEN THE UNIT RIGHT NEXT TO THAT HAS ONLY A ONE-CAR GARAGE BECAUSE OF THE FOUNDATIONS. SO IT'S THREE LESS THAN FOUR FOR EACH ONE OF THE UNITS.
00:53:58.297: >> Commissioner Sauve: OKAY. I WANT TO KNOW FOR OUR REFERENCE IN TERMS OF HOW WE ARE LOOKING AT PROJECTS.
00:54:03.969: >> RIGHT.
00:54:04.270: >> Commissioner Sauve: FOR SIGNAGE, I WOULD BE INTERESTED TO KNOW, ESPECIALLY AT THE FRONT WITH THE TWO EXITS OUT TO THE ROAD AND THE CONFLICT POINT WITH THE APARTMENTS IS THERE ANY SIGNAGE CURRENTLY?
00:54:14.547: >> NO, THERE'S NOT AND WE AGREED TO PUT UP THE PROPER SIGNAGE, CHILLAYING AND WHATEVER YOU RECOMMEND, WE ARE HAPPY TO DO THAT.
00:54:22.555: >> Commissioner Sauve: YEP. AND THEN FOR THE TURNING PERVIOUS PAVEMENT FOR THE FIRE TRUCKS, IS THERE ANY SIGNAGE THERE? IT LOOKS LIKE A GREAT PARKING SPOTS FOR GUESTS? IF YOU HAVE THREE CARS THERE AND THE FIRE TRUCK CAN'T TURN AROUND, WHAT ARE MITIGATING FACTOR?
00:54:42.908: >> THERE'S NO PARKING FIRE LANE CERTAINLY IN THAT AREA. IT WILL BE LINED ON BOTH SIDES OF THAT AND THEN POTENTIALLY YOU COULD ACTUALLY IMPRINT IT IN A PAINT MARKINGS ON THE PAVEMENT ITSELF BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO PARK THERE. WHEN IT GETS FILLED, IT WOULD BE A FIRE AND THEN YOU CAN NEVER GET THEM OUT. NO PARKING IS AT ALL ALLOWED ON THAT APRON.
00:55:07.299: >> Commissioner Sauve: THAT'S REGULATED BY THE FIRE DEPARTMENT FOR THOSE FIRE LANES.
00:55:10.536: >> YES.
00:55:10.803: >> Commissioner Sauve: THOSE WERE THE TRAFFIC CONCERNS I HAD. I WANTED TO GO BACK TO THE STAFF REPORT, BECAUSE IN THE DESCRIPTION, THERE IS -- PART IT SAYS THESE WETLANDS WERE PART OF AN EARLIER ATTEMPT TO MITIGATE THE LOSS OF SOME WETLAND AREAS ON SITE WHEN FIRST HIGHWAY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT WAS BEING CONSTRUCTED APPROXIMATELY 15 YEARS AGO. COULD YOU SHED SOME CLARIFICATION ON ALL OF THAT.
00:55:36.395: >> I WOULD LIKE TO BRING UP THE LANDSCAPE ARCHITECT TO ADDRESS THAT. LET'S GET THE EXPERT UP HERE.
00:55:46.939: >> MY NAME IS JAMES GRAY. SO I GOT INVOLVED IN THIS PROJECT IN 2018 AND WHEN I DID, WHEN THE REVIEW CAME OUT FROM JERRY, ON THE EASTERLY PART OF THE SITE, THERE WAS SOME SUPPOSEDLY WETLAND MITIGATION THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO TAKE PLACE. WEWELL, APPARENTLY IT ALL FAILE. SO NOW WITH THIS PLAN, WE ARE RESPECIFYING WHAT WAS ORIGINALLY SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN. SO THAT'S ALL GOT TO BE REDONE.
00:56:18.137: >> Commissioner Sauve: GOT IT. AND SO THE WETLANDS ON THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE SITE --
00:56:24.309: >> THERE'S ANOTHER ONE ON THE VERY SOUTH CORNER WHERE THE POINT IS. THAT'S GOT TO BE REDONE AS WELL. THAT'S CALLED OUT FOR ON THE NEW PLAN.
00:56:32.184: >> Commissioner Sauve: OKAY. I GUESS IT GO BACK TO THE EROSION CONDITION BECAUSE THOSE HAVEN'T EXISTED FOR PAST TEN YEARS IN A HEALTHY CAPACITY, WOULD THAT BE PART OF MAYBE SOME OF THAT RUNOFF AND EROSION?
00:56:44.663: >> NO, BECAUSE THEY ARE OVERGROWN RIGHT NOW. THEY HAVE ALL GOT TO BE CLEARED BACK OUT AND RED PROPERLY.
00:56:53.372: >> Commissioner Sauve: RIGHT. SO THEY ARE NOT WORKING RIGHT NOW?
00:56:55.207: >> THEY ARE NOT FUNCTION RIGHT NOW.
00:56:57.676: >> Commissioner Sauve: I GUESS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE REASONS FOR THE EROSION AT THE BANKS AND CERTAIN DIVERSIONS THAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED TO TELL THAT STORY AGAIN.
00:57:06.218: >> I CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT. I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH WHAT HAPPENED IN THE PAST.
00:57:10.022: >> THAT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT AREA. WHAT JAMES IS TALKING ABOUT, THE WETLANDS THEMSELVES ARE NOT FUNCTIONING AS WETLANDS PROPERLY NOW, HOWEVER, THE STORMWATER MANAGEMENT PLAN IS FUNCTIONING. WE WERE POINTING OUT A PROBLEM IN THE VERY CENTER OF THE SITE, FAR AWAY FROM THE WETLANDS WHERE THERE APPEARS TO BE AN EROSION AND AN A DROP IN THE EMBANKMENT GOING DOWN TO THE CREEK ITSELF. SO THE WETLANDS TO THE SOUTH AND THE WETLANDS TO THE EAST HAVE TO BE MITIGATED, AND HAVE TO BE REGROWN. BUT THE STORM SEWER SYSTEM ITSELF IS FUNCTIONING AND IT IS PICKING UP THE STORMWATER INSTEAD OF IT CASCADING DOWN THE SIDE OF THE EMBANKMENT OF THE CREEK.
00:57:56.602: >> TO YOUR QUESTION REGARDING EROSION, ACTUALLY THE OPPOSITE HAS HAPPENED BECAUSE EVERYTHING WAS OVERGROWN AND THERE WAS A GABION THAT MR. STEPH ANDS WANTED CLEANED. WE SPENT MONEY REMOVING THE TREES AND NOW IT'S FUNCTIONING BEAUTIFULLY. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU --
00:58:16.054: >> Commissioner Sauve: MM-HMM.
00:58:18.991: >> SO WE DON'T HAVE AN EROSION ISSUE. WE HAVE AN OVERGROWTH ISSUE, BUT WE ARE GOING TO REPLANT IT PROPERLY AND MR. GRAY WILL MONITOR IT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. WE WILL EMPLOY HIM CONTRACTUALLY SO THAT WE KNOW THAT IT'S DONE WELL AND IT'S FUNCTIONING PROPERLY.
00:58:36.975: >> Commissioner Sauve: GREAT. THANK YOU.
00:58:37.910: >> YOU'RE WELCOME.
00:58:40.179: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT.
00:58:42.514: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: THANK YOU. I JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF THINGS. SOMETHING THAT -- WELL, FIRST OF ALL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ADDRESSING ALL THE CONCERNS THAT WERE BROUGHT UP IN THE LAST MEETING. I REALLY APPRECIATED THAT. SOMETHING THAT CAME UP IN THERE THAT YOU ADDRESSED BUT SOMETHING THAT CAME UP AGAIN TONIGHT, I DON'T WANT TO USE THE WORD "QUALITY" NECESSARILY BUT THE LAND MAY BE TOO MUSHY TO LIVE IN. PEOPLE WHO LIVE THERE SAY IT IS N,AND SOMEBODY HAS NOT. I ASSUME YOU WOULDN'T LET A PLAN GO THROUGH THAT THE BILLINGS MIGHT FALL THROUGH, BUT IT SEEMED LIKE A VERY STRONG CONCERN FROM RESIDENTS.
00:59:18.217: >> RIGHT. HYDROLOGYARIES THROUGHOUT THE CITY. AND SO DO SOIL TYPES AND VEGETATION, SLOPE. SO EVERY SITE IS UNIQUE. SOME WATER TABLES ARE HIGH IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE CITY AND SOME AREAS WATER TABLES ARE LOWER. WITH REGARD TO THIS SITE, THE CITY CODE DOES NOT ALLOW THE DEVELOPERS TO BUILD IN WETLANDS AND WETLAND BUFFERS IN CREEKS AND FLOODPLAINS. NO RESIDENTIAL IN THE FLOODWAYS. SO WE DO HAVE REGULATIONS, BUT IF YOU ARE LOOKING AT A PIECE OF LAND THAT HYDROLOGICALLY MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE CHALLENGES, WE DON'T HAVE ANY ENFORCEMENT POWER TO PREVENT THE DEVELOPMENT OF HOMES ON THAT SITE.
01:00:09.434: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: OKAY.
01:00:12.037: >> SO THESE FOLKS ARE REQUIRED TO CONDUCT SOIL BORINGS BEFORE CONSTRUCTION, AND LENDERS GET TO LOOK AT THAT, AND IF THERE ARE PROBLEMS, LENDERS WILL HAVE A HARD TIME PROVIDING FUNDING FOR A DEVELOPMENT PROJECT.
01:00:28.954: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: GOT IT.
01:00:30.088: >> AND I WOULD JUST TACK ON, SO THE -- AS PART OF THE EVALUATION OF IT, WE -- IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES, I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT EVERYTHING IS CONSTRUCTED ACCORDING TO REQUIRED BUILDING CODE REQUIREMENTS AS WELL. SO THERE ARE BASIC REQUIREMENTS THAT WILL HAVE TO BE SATISFIED AND THE BUILDING DEPARTMENT, AS WITH OTHER COMMUNITIES IS VERY DELIBERATE AND THEY ARE LOOKING AT NOT ONLY THE PHASES OF CONSTRUCTION FROM FOOTERS TO FOUNDATIONS. SO IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT IS NOT GOING TO MEET BUILDING CODE REQUIREMENTS BECAUSE OF THE CONDITIONS OF THAT SOIL, THEN THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE ADDRESSED IN SOME WAYS. I THINK THERE ARE WAYS THAT THOSE CONDITIONS CAN BE MITIGATED, BUT THEY WOULD HAVE TO BE SATISFIED TO MEET THE BUILDING CODE REQUIREMENTS.
01:01:18.003: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: OKAY. THANK YOU.
01:01:19.104: >> I HAVE A VERY NICE THOUGHT. WHEN YOU BUILD A HOME, YOU BUILD IT, AND YOU BUILD IT ACCORDING TO PLANS AND THEN WHEN YOU GET YOUR CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY, IT GOES THROUGH ALL OF YOUR EXPERIENCES THAT I NEVER EXPERIENCED. IT'S VERY GOOD. YOU MENTIONED TREES. WE HAVE TO BUILD THE ENTIRE SITE OUT, AND THEN WE HAVE TO GET AN AS-BUILT FOR EVERY SINGLE TREE ON THAT SITE. SO WHATEVER YOU PLANTED, YOU KNOW, THIS YEAR, BETTER BE LIVING BECAUSE YOU DON'T GET A FULL CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY. SO IN REFERENCE TO THE DRAINAGE, RIGHT NOW YOU DON'T HAVE -- THE LAND IS NOT BALANCE, OKAY? IT'S NOT BALANCED AS TO WHERE EACH HOME GOES INDIVIDUALLY. AND WHEN IT IS, YOU HAVE TO DO AN AS-BUILT. EVERY SINGLE DROP. WATER HAS TO GO TO A SPECIFIC SWAIL OR A CATCH BASIN AND SO IT'S BUILT ACCORDING TO HOW IT'S DESIGNED. SO AS AN EXAMPLE, THE THREE BASEMENTS I HAD, THERE WAS AN AS-BUT AND THEY WERE WITHIN A HALF INCH -- YOU KNOW, WHICH IS WITHIN THE TOLERANCE LEVEL. THEY ARE WORKING PERFECTLY WELL, BUT THE SYSTEM EMPLOYED BY YOUR CITY IS VERY COMPREHENSIVE. IT'S REALLY HARD TO MAKE AN ERROR. THEY HAVE CHECKS AND RECHECKS.
01:02:35.847: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: GREAT.
01:02:37.382: >> YOU'RE WELCOME.
01:02:38.016: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: JUST ONE OTHER THING ABOUT THE RAILROAD TRACK. I SAW THAT WE WERE ASKING FOR A REDUCTION IN THE SETBACK FROM 30 TO 20 FEET AND YOU ARE NOT ADJACENT TO ANY PROPERTIES. BUT IT PUTS YOU 10 FEET CLOSER TO A RAILROAD TRACK FOR A COUPLE OF BUILDINGS. I ASSUME THERE'S NO CODE CONCERNS WITH THAT. I JUST -- I ON WOULD WANT TO LIVE 20 FEET AWAY FROM A RAILROAD TRACK).
01:03:06.578: >> HE WHY, IF JEFF CAN GO THROUGH -- YES, IF YES CAN GO THROUGH THE POWER POINT AGAIN. ON PAGE NUMBER -- I THINK IT'S 12. I DIDN'T QUITE GET THERE. I DIDN'T TALK QUITE FAST ENOUGH TO GET THERE AT MY PRESENTATION, BUT I DEAL WITH THOSE SETBACKS FROM THE -- FROM THE RAILROAD TRAFFICS TO PAGE 12. ONE MORE? KEEP GOING. I'M SORRY. THERE YOU GO. SO THE ORIGINAL MAP THAT IS CURRENTLY APPROVED, THE SINGLE FAMILY HOMES HAD TWO SINGLE FAMILY HOMES BACKING UP TO THOSE RAILROAD TRACKS WITHIN 20 FEET OF THE REAR PROPERTY LINE. THE TRACKS THEMSELVES ARE 50 FEET FURTHER SOUTH THAN THE REAR PROPERTY LINE. OKAY? SO THERE'S A SUBSTANTIAL -- OTHERWISE -- YOU WOULD THINK YOU WERE AT HALLOWEEN EVERY DAY PROBABLY. SO THIS SETBACK CHART THAT I HAVE PROVIDED HERE FOR THE RAILROAD TRACKS, THE CORNER OF ONE BUILDING NOW, INSTEAD OF TWO FULL BUILDINGS, IT'S ONLY 20 FEET FROM THE PROPERTY LINE. BUILDING JUMPS TO 60 FEET, 95 FEET AND 195 FEET AND THEN THE TRACKS ARE 50 FEET FURTHER THAN THAT. AND THEY ARE UP 14 TO 16 FEET ABOVE THESE HOMES. SO IT -- THERE'S A SUBSTANTIAL GAP THERE BETWEEN THE STRUCTURES.
01:04:37.102: >> AND YOU HAVE LIKE A 45-DEGREE ANGLE, BECAUSE I TRIED TO CLIMB IT THROUGH ALL THE TREES. AND I WAS LIKE GRABBING ON TO STUFF TO COME DOWN.
01:04:46.912: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: AND THERE ARE TREES?
01:04:49.314: >> YES. VERY, VERY HEAVILY FORESTED.
01:04:52.384: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: I DID NOT SEE THAT ADDITIONAL 5.
01:04:56.288: >> AND WE ELIMINATED ONE OF THE HOUSES THIS. SO IT'S BETTER.
01:04:59.024: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: OKAY. GREAT. THANK YOU.
01:05:02.761: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL. COULD MR. GRAY COME BACK UP. I'M JUST CURIOUS WHAT IS YOUR ASSESSMENT OF THE TREES DYING. DO YOU FEEL IT'S JUST BEEN DOUDROUGHTY?
01:05:18.577: >> I THINK IT'S TIME OF PLANTING AND THE WATERING.
01:05:22.247: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE THE SPECIES IS APPROPRIATE FOR THE LAND.
01:05:25.016: >> I DIDN'T SEE THEM PLANTED. I DIDN'T SEE WHAT HAPPENED AFTER. THAT'S JUST MY EDUCATED GUESS.
01:05:31.823: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: OKAY. ALL RIGHTY.
01:05:34.693: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER ABRAMS.
01:05:36.928: >> Commissioner Abrons:  THANK YOU. COULD YOU MAYBE WALK ME THROUGH THE PROCESS OF THE TRAFFIC ANALYSIS? NOT ONLY -- I MEAN IT'S CLEAR TO ME THAT THERE'S ANALYSIS ABOUT THE NUMBER OF TRAFFIC -- OR THE QUANTITY OF TRAFFIC BUT I DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING ABOUT THE WIDTH OF THE ROADWAY OR THE RADII OR THE ACCESS POINTS.
01:05:57.983: >> YEAH, I WOULD BE HAPPY TO TRY TO RESPOND TO THAT, AND IT LOOKS LIKE MR. POWELL WOULD LIKE TO PARTICIPATE AS WELL. THE WIDTH OF THE STREET, OR THE PRIVATE STREET IS 21 TO 22-FOOT RANGE, WHICH IS WELL WITHIN OUR REQUIREMENTS OF 18 TO 24 FEET FOR A PRIVATE -- FOR A PRIVATE STREET. THE TRAFFIC STUDY THAT MR. POWELL REFERRED TO WOULD TYPICALLY LOOK AT I.T.E. STUDIES WHICH IS THE INSTITUTE OF TRAFFIC ENGINEERS, AND THIS COMPILES STUDIES FROM -- FROM DECADES FROM NOW UNTIL -- I MEAN, FOR MANY DECADES AND IT'S A PRETTY HARD SCIENCE AND WHAT IT'S TELLING US IS THAT SINGLE FAMILY DEVELOPMENT REALLY DOES GENERATE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF VEHICULAR TRIPS A DAY BECAUSE SINGLE FAMILY HOMES HAVE THE MOST NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS, INCLUDING CHILDREN. AND SO AS YOU MOVE AWAY FROM SINGLE FAMILY DEVELOPMENT TO TWO FAMILY AND TOWNHOME AND STACKED FLATS, YOU GET FAR FEWER TRIPS PER DWELLING UNIT. SO SINGLE FAMILY HOMES REALLY DO GENERATE A LOT OF -- A LOT OF TRAFFIC IN COMPARISON TO DUPLEXES AND TOWNHOMES AND THESE ARE -- YOU KNOW,SE ARE DUPLEXES THAT ARE SORT OF CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE ARE HROUGHOUT THE CITY AS ATTACHED UNITS, TOWNHOMES ANDCAS SUCH AS THESE AS YOU WOULD IN A SINGLE FAMILY -- A TRADITIONAL SINGLE FAMILY DEVEL I'M GOING TO DEFER TO MR. POWELL TO SEE IF HE HAS ANY OTHER POINTS TO BE MADE.
01:07:57.569: >> MY RESPONSES TO LAST MEETING'S QUESTIONS ON THE TRAFFIC, I ALSO POINTED OUT THAT WE WIDENED THE ROO IDENTIFYWAY OUT IN OF THE FIRE HYDRANTS -- ROADWAY OUT IN FRONT OF THE FIRE HYDRANTS THAT THE FIRE DEPARTMENT, SO THAT WE CAN USE THE HYDRANTS AND ALLOW FOR TWO-WAY TRAFFIC TO OCCUR ADJACENT TO THOSE, AS WELL AS THE FACT THAT THE SITE PLAN HAS BEEN DESIGNED AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO MODIFY SOME RADII THAT WAS INSTALLED PREVIOUSLY AND SO THE OWNER HAS THEM MARKED OUT AND READY TO BE MODIFIED AS PART OF THE SITE PLAN APPROVAL AS WELL.
01:08:38.476: >> IN ADDITION TO THAT, WE HAD TO HIRE A CONSULTANT, WHO HAD TO GO THROUGH -- YOU HAVE A VERY THOROUGH PROCESS. MRS. REDDINGER MADE US DO THAT. WE DID THE LITTLE THING IN THE ROAD THAT COUNTED THEM, THE CARS. IT WAS REALLY COMPREHENSIVE. WE DID IT TWICE IN ORDER TO GET HER BLESSING.
01:09:07.505: >> Commissioner Abrons: THAT'S ALL. THANK YOU.
01:09:13.311: >> Chair Milshteyn: MR. KAHAN, DID OUR TRAFFIC ENGINEER REVIEW THE STUDY.
01:09:18.550: >> YES, CYNTHIA REDDINGER WAS IN CHARGE OF THE REVIEW.
01:09:22.620: >> Chair Milshteyn: AND THERE ARE NO CONCERNS IN REGARDS TO TRAFFIC?
01:09:25.757: >> NO.
01:09:26.024: >> Chair Milshteyn: THEN I HAVE A QUESTION IN REGARDS TO HOW THE -- I'M ASSUMING THIS WILL BE A CONDOMINIUM ASSOCIATION, HOW THE CONDOMINIUM ASSOCIATION IS STRUCTURED WITH REGARDS TO THIS' AN EXISTING BUILDING THAT'S RIGHT AT THE CORNER OF HIDEAWAY AND TRAVER. AND THEN THE EXISTING CONDOE MINIUM BUILDING, THE EIGHT OR NINE UNITS THAT ARE BEING THERE. HOW IS THAT STRUCTURED? IS IT PART OF ONE ASSOCIATION OR MULTIPLE ASSOCIATIONS? HOW IS THAT HAPPENING?
01:09:58.356: >> THE EXISTING UNITS HAVE BEEN THERE SINCE 1968. SO THEY ARE OBVIOUSLY FUNCTIONING WITH AN ASSOCIATION. WE PROBABLY WILL HAVE TWO. BUT WE'LL CERTAINLY TRY TO GET TOGETHER WITH THEM AND DO THE ECONOMY OF SCALES, PARTICULARLY FOR EXPENSES, BECAUSE IT'S JUST AN INTELLIGENT WAY TO GO AND USE THE SAME SUB -- YOU KNOW THE VENDORS.
01:10:20.712: >> Chair Milshteyn: OKAY.
01:10:21.379: >> SO THAT WOULD BE MY ASSUMPTION.
01:10:24.115: >> Chair Milshteyn: SO IS THIS A SHARED DRIVEWAY, ROADWAY AGREEMENTS BECAUSE THOSE EXISTING CONDOMINIUM ABUT HIDEAWAY LANE. I ASSUME IT'S A PRIVATE LANE.
01:10:38.563: >> OBVIOUSLY THEY MAINTAINED IT FOR 50 YEARS AND THE ONLY INGRESS AND EGRESS WOULD BE THAT ROAD THAT GOES IN AND OUT. SO THAT WOULD BE THE ONLY SHARED EXPENSE WHICH WE'LL PARTICIPATE IN THAT. AND IN REFERENCE TO -- YOU KNOW, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT AS-BUILT. SO THAT TURNING RADIUS WAS DONE YEARS AGO. AND YOUR S ENGINEER, VERY COMPREHENSIVE SAID WE WANT YOU TO FIX IT. WE HAVE TO REMOVE ALL THE SIDEWALK BECAUSE IT'S CRACKED AN ERODED AND IT RADIUS. THERE'S NOTHING THAT GETS BY THE CITY.
01:11:13.364: >> Chair Milshteyn: ALL RIGHT. COMMISSIONER BRIGGS?
01:11:18.303: >> Commissioner Briggs: I THOUGHT THIS MIGHT COME UP IN SOMEBODY ELSE'S COMMENTS, BUT IT DIDN'T. IN TERMS OF THE BIKE PARKING, I APPRECIATE HOW MUCH BIKE PARKING IS IN THE GARAGES. I DO SEE THAT THE ONE RACK IS END HBEHIND THE DUMPSTER ON THEH SIDE OF THE SITE. MR. KAHAN IS THERE ANOTHER SITE, BESIDES BEHIND AT A DUMPSTER ON THAT SITE.
01:11:45.330: >> THAT'S THE ONE LOCATION THAT I'M AWARE OF. THAT'S A CLASS A SPACE OR TWO CLASS A SPACES.
01:11:53.271: >> Commissioner Briggs: IT'S SO TYPICAL. IT'S ALWAYS LIKE, WELL, THE SPOT THAT'S PAVED IS RIGHT NEXT TO THE DUMPSTER, AND LET'S PUT IT RIGHT THERE. NOBODY WANTS TO PARK THEIR BIKE NEXT TO A DUMPSTER.
01:12:03.081: >> SO WE'LL LOOK INTO CHANGING THAT, POTENTIALLY. WE WILL DO ENCOURAGE BIKES. WE PREFER IT. AS A MATTER OF FACT, ON OUR HER SITES WE VOLUNTARILY PUT THEM IN, BECAUSE I WOULD PREFER PEOPLE TO USE A BIKE THAN A CAR. I JUST THINK IT'S BETTER. AND PARTICULARLY SINCE IT'S SO CLOSE TO THE HOSPITAL, I CAN SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE WITH, YOU KNOW, GOOD WEATHER USING BIKES. SO WE WOULD TRY TO FIND OTHER SPOTS THAT WOULD BE APPROVED TO DO THAT AND WE WOULD VOLUNTARILY DO THAT. THAT'S A GREAT POINT.
01:12:33.745: >> Commissioner Briggs: THAT WOULD BE GREAT IF YOU COULD MAYBE BEFORE IT GOES TO COUNCIL, IF YOU COULD FIND A DIFFERENT SPOT.
01:12:38.616: >> OR ADD SOMETHING. SURE. BECAUSE THAT ONE WOULD BE SHARED BY EXISTING PHASE UP, THERE BECAUSE IT'S CLOSER UP FRONT WHICH THEY DON'T HAVE ONE RIGHT NOW.
01:12:52.030: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN.
01:12:53.064: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR. TWO POINTS OF FOLLOW-UP OF THINGS THAT MIGHT BE HARD INFRASTRUCTURE. I THINK THE PLACEMENT OF THE BIKE RACKS IS A GREAT POINT AND IS SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S SOME APPETITE TO ADD ADDITIONAL. AND THEN THE GENEROUS OFFER TO EXPLORE TRAFFIC CALMING TECHNIQUES EITHER ON SITE OR ADJACENT TO THE SITE WHAT IS THE BEST -- I GUESS, WHAT ARE THE NEXT STEPS FOR STAFF TO FOLLOW UP ON AND WHAT DO YOU RECOMMEND AS OUR ACTION?
01:13:23.461: >> I WOULD SUGGEST PERHAPS ADDING SOME CONDITIONS TO THE MOTION TO REFLECT WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH, AND THEN I WOULD LEAVE IT TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION IF YOU WANT TO SEE THE DETAILS OF THOSE PRIOR TO MAKING A RECOMMENDATION OR HELP US UNDERSTAND THE GOALS THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO ACHIEVE WITH THEM AND THEN WE CAN WORK WITH STAFF AND MODIFY THE PROPOSAL AS IT PROGRESSES TO CITY COUNCIL.
01:13:48.586: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  I THINK WITH RESPECT TO THE BIKE RACKS, IT'S A LITTLE MORE STRAIGHTFORWARD, JUST LOOK FOR ALTERNATIVE PLACEMENT OR ADDITIONAL PLACEMENT THAT WOULD BE MORE ATTRACTIVE AND MORE USEFUL. USEFUL FOR RESIDENTS. WITH RESPECT TO THE SIGNAGE OR THE TRAFFIC CALMING, I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT PROBABLY REQUIRES MORE DISCUSSION. IF IT'S ON SITE, I THINK THAT CONVERSATION INVOLVES THE PETITIONER AND THE CITY STAFF AS TO WHAT IS THE APPROPRIATE SIGNAGE TO MAKE SURE THAT RESIDENTS ARE SAFE WITHIN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD OR AS THIS ERR LEAVING THIS NEIGHBORHOOD. IF THERE'S SOMETHING OUTSIDE THE DEVELOPMENT, IT OBVIOUSLY NEEDS TO INCLUDE NEIGHBORS IN CONVERSATIONS OF WHETHER OR NOT THEY WANT TRAFFIC CALMING IN THEIR AREA OR NOT. AND WITH THAT, IT WOULD PROBABLY BE SOME KIND OF A FINANCIAL COMMITMENT TO FUTURE PLANS. SO IT'S A MORE ELABORATE CONDITION.
01:14:45.009: >> I AGREE WITH THAT. WE COULD -- WITH ANY SORT OF CONDITION ADDED TO THE MOTION, I WOULD PROBABLY LOOK TO MEMORIALIZE THAT ARRANGEMENT, HOW -- HOW THE CITY WOULD LIKE TO DIRECT ANY INPUT, HOW THE FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES WOULD BE DELINEATED. WE WOULD ESTABLISH THOSE REQUIREMENTS MOST LIKELY IN THE DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT THAT ACCOMPANIES SITE PLAN. THAT WOULD ULTIMATELY BE CONSIDERED BY CITY COUNCIL. THAT WOULD S FORTH MORE OF A PROCESS AND AN EXPECTATION OF RESPONSIBILITIES BETWEEN THE CITY AND THE PETITIONER. IT WOULD LIKELY BE POTENTIALLY FINALIZED IN ADVANCE OF THE CIVIL ENGINEERING DRAWINGS THAT WOULD TYPICALLY FOLLOW THE SITE PLAN APPROVAL. SO AGAIN, I THINK A CONDITION COULD ACCOMPLISH THAT AND THAT'S HOW I WOULD RESPOND TO THAT, P.BYMEMORIALIZING THAT, TRYING O ESTABLISH IT IN THE PLANNING AGREEMENT.
01:15:43.100: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  IT DS LIKE COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL HAS AN IDEA AND I CAN WORK WITH COMMISSIONER BRIGGS ON THE BIKE RACK.
01:15:50.641: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: MY OFFICE IS IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD AND THERE'S ALREADY TRAFFIC CALMING IN TRAVER AND I DON'T RECOMMEND THAT WE DO ANYTHING OUTSIDE OF THAT, BECAUSE THERE'S SPEED BUMPS ALONG TRAVER. AND THEY ARE PRETTY RAPIDLY TRANSITIONS INTO A DIRT ROAD WHICH HAS NATURAL SPEED BUMPS ON IT. SO I WOULD SAY IF THERE'S A DESIRE FOR TRAFFIC CALMING THAT IT WOULD BE WITHIN THE DEVELOPMENT RATHER THAN ON THE OUTSIDE IN TERMS OF HOW YOU WOULD BE WORDING YOUR AMENDMENT.
01:16:17.568: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  IF I MAY, MR. CHAIR.
01:16:21.439: >> Chair Milshteyn: OF COURSE.
01:16:22.073: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  I THINK -- I APPRECIATE THAT -- HOWEVER, IF THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO PARTNER WITH THE PETITIONER TO GO ABOVE AND BEYOND TO MAKE THIS NEIGHBORHOOD SAFER, I'M SURE THERE ARE NEEDS AROUND NORTH SIDE SCHOOL OR THE LIKE THAT ARE IMMEDIATELY, YOU KNOW, RELEVANT TO THE -- TO THE PROPERTY OWNERS HERE SINCE THEY WILL BE IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT AND I'M SURE THERE ARE NEEDS IN THIS AREA, I GUESS IS WHAT I WOULD SAY, AND IF THIS PETITIONER IS OPEN TO HAVING THAT DIALOGUE, I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE IT.
01:16:55.206: >> MAY I MAKE A SUGGESTION? I WOULD LIKE TO GET OUR TRAFFIC ENGINEER TO MAKE SOME SUGGESTIONS AND IF I CAN WORK WITH MR. KAHAN AND MAKE IT SUBJECT TO ENGINEERING APPROVAL, THAT WOULD BE -- THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE. AND THAT WAY WE COULD ACCOMPLISH THE OBJECTIVE. I DO THINK TRAFFIC -- YOU KNOW, TRAVER -- BECAUSE I TRAVEL IT EVERY DAY. THOSE BUMPS ARE EFFECTIVE! YOU KNOW? AND THEY ARE VERY EFFECTIVE TO CONSTRUCTION GUYS BECAUSE THEY WILL LOSE EVERYTHING, YOU KNOW, IF THEY GO OVER THEM WITH ANY VELOCITY. SO MY SUGGESTION WOULD BE TO GET SLICE VANDER BECK TO MAKE A SUGGESTION. WE CAN RUN IT BY -- RUN IT BY YOU AND SEE IF IT MAKES SENSE AND MAKE SURE THAT ENGINEERING IS OKAY WITH IT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
01:17:45.423: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES. SO LET ME FIND THE MOTION AND I WILL MOVE TO MAKE AN AMENDMENT. SO I WOULD MOVE ONE AMENDMENT TO THE MOTION TO READ THAT THE PETITIONER AND CITY STAFF EXPLORE ALTERNATIVE OR ADDITIONAL LOCATIONS FOR BIKE PARKING. SO THAT WOULD BE FIRST MOTION.
01:18:31.068: >> Chair Milshteyn: SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL. ANY DISCUSSION ON THAT MOTION? ALL IN FAVOR, PLEASE SAY AYE. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? ALL RIGHT.
01:18:40.077: >> Councilmember Ackerman: AND I WOULD MAKE ANOTHER MOTION THAT READS THE PETITIONER AND THE CITY COLLABORATE TO -- COLLABORATE ON THE ADDITION OF SIGNAGE AND TRAFFIC CALMING MECHANISMS TO INCREASE THE PUBLIC SAFETY AND WELFARE OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
01:19:05.036: >> Chair Milshteyn: SECONDED BY -- COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT. FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL THOSE IN FAVOR OF THE AMENDMENT, PLEASE SAY AYE. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. WE ARE BACK TO THE MAIN MOTION. FURTHER DISCUSSION? READY FOR A VOTE? ALL THOSE IN FAVOR, PLEASE SAY AYE. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED. THANK YOU.
01:19:32.930: >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, COMMISSIONERS. MOVINGON TO REGULAR BUSINESS, 10A, 212 SOUTH STATE STREET MULTIFAMILY RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT SITE PLAN FOR CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL. WE WILL START WITH THE PETITIONER AND THEN TO MR. CHANG. AND THEN WE'LL HAVE A MOTION AND DISCUSSION. SO WE WILL LET THE PETITIONER SET UP.
01:20:42.333: >> GOOD EVENING. MY NAME IS BRAD MOORE. ONE OF THE ARCHITECTS ON THE PROJECT. I HAVE MY COHORT HERE, NEIL REARDON FROM S. EX G. AND THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE DEVELOPMENT TEAMS, OTHER SPECIALTIES HERE TONIGHT. I WANTED TO DO A QUICK RUN THROUGH. THIS IS ONE OF TWO PROJECTS THAT WILL BE BEFORE YOU TONIGHT. THEY ARE COMPANION PROJECTS. THEY ARE NOT GOING TO BE BUILT WITHOUT EACH OTHER. SO THEY ARE INTERRELATED ASPECTS BETWEEN THEM THAT I WANT TO RUN THROUGH. IN TERMS OF THE LOCATION OF THE SITE, THIS IS A SITE THAT'S LOCATED ON EAST WASHINGTON. THERE ARE TWO SITES. ONE FRONTS ON WASHINGTON STREET AND THE OTHER IN YELLOW, WHICH IS THE 212 SOUTH STATE STREET SITE TOUCH AND ABUT AND THERE ARE ASPECTS THAT WE WILL GO INTO, HOW THEY COORDINATE ONE TO THE OTHER. THIS IS A MAP OF THE HISTORIC DISTRICT OF THE STATE STREET. THE HISTORIC DISTRICT, AND THIS PROJECT, THE 212 FALLS INTO THIS DISTRICT. WE HAVE BEEN BEFORE THE HISTORIC DISTRICT COMMISSION, AND WE HAVE RECEIVED APPROVAL FOR THIS BUILDING. SO THAT'S ALREADY BEEN RESOLVED. WE HAVE A NUMBER OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS THAT THESE JOINT PROJECTS OFFER, WHICH INCLUDE SOME VERY MICRO SMALL APARTMENTS IN THE 212 PROJECT DESIGNED TO COME ON THE MARKET AT OUR LOWER LEVEL OF COST, TO TARGET WORKFORCE HOUSING. THERE'S GOING TO BE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF TAX INCREASE ON THE SITE. WE ARE GOING TO BE PROVIDING SOME NEW CODE COMPLIANT THEATER RESTROOMS AS PART OF THAT BUSINESS AND WE INTEND TO SOLVE A BIG PROBLEM IN THIS BILL CORNER OF THE CITY, WHICH HAPPENS TO BE THE REFUSE, AND RECYCLABLE COLLECTION. KNOWING I HAVE A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME, LET ME GET THROUGH THERE. THIS IS AIL PICTURE OF THE SITE LOOKING FROM THE EMERGENCY EGRESS DOORS THE MICHIGAN THEATER. YOU CAN SEE THERE'S A LOT OF TRASH THERE, THAT THE PHYSICAL SITE WHERE THE BUILDING WOULD SIT IS THE DIRT PARKING LOT. ON THE LEFT THERE, WHICH USED TO BE OCCUPIED BY A BUILDING WHICH BURNED DOWN SEVERAL YEARS AGO -- OOPS, THE OTHER WAY. SORRY. ANOTHER VIEW OF THE -- THAT PRIVATE ALLEY THAT IS SOUTH OF OUR PROJECT, THAT WE HAVE PROPOSED TO BE IMPROVING AS PART OF OUR PROJECT, HERE'S A DIAGRAM INDICATING HOW WE INTEND TO HELP SOLVE THE TRASH HANDLING PROBLEM. THE NEW BUILDING ON 212 IS PROPOSED TO HAVE A COMMUNAL TRASH STORAGE ROOM IN THE SOUTHEAST CORNER WHICH IS DESIGNED TO HANDLE THE REFUSE FROM OUR PRODUCTS, PHYSICALLY THOSE WHO OCCUPY THE 212 SITE AND THE OTHER ADJACENT COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS, INCLUDING THE STARBUCKS BUILDING ON THE CORNER THERE, WHICH HAS ONLY REFUSE COLLECTION DONE BY CARTS. THEY HAVE TO SIT OUT ON THE PUBLIC SIDEWALK. SO OUR GOAL IS TO SHIFT EVERYTHING BACK INTERNAL IN AN ENCLOSED ROOM SO THERE'S NO MAR TRASH OVERKNO OVERFLOWING INTO E NEIGHBORHOOD. THE OTHER PROJECT THAT'S COMPANION PROJECT, 616 EAST WASHINGTON. IT WILL TAKE NOT ONLY OUR TRASH AND RECYCLABLES AND THE TRASH AND THE RECYCLABLES FROM THE MICHIGAN THEATER AND THE MICHIGAN THEATER OFFICE BUILDING WHICH IS IN FRONT OF THE MICHIGAN THEATER PROPER. SO WE WILL HAVE FULLY MODERNED ENCLOSED TRASH HANDLING FACILITIES. HERE'S THE DIAGRAM OF HOW WE INTEND TO MODERNIZE AND UPGRADE THE MICHIGAN THEATER'S REST ROOM FACILITIES. CURRENTLY AS YOU CAN SEE IN THE DIAGRAM ON THE LEFT, THE RESTROOMS OR SEQUESTERED IN THE BACK CORNER OF THE THEATER, A LONG CIRCUITOUS TO GET BACK THERE. THEY DON'T MEET THE CURRENT PLUMBING CODE FOR THE NUMBER OF FIXTURES THAT THEY HAVE TO HAVE IN THE COMBINED SCREENING ROOM AND THE MAIN BODY OF THE MICHIGAN THEATER. NOT ONLY DO THEY NOT HAVE THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF FIXTURES, THEY ALSO LACK SOMETHING THAT'S PART OF THE MODERN PLUMBING CODE WHICH IS A GENDER NEUTRAL OR FAMILY BATHROOM. THAT'S OCCUPYING THE FIRST PART OF OUR BUILDING, 212 SOUTH STATE STREET BUILDING. THE BALANCE OF IT WILL BE THE VERTICAL CIRCULATION, THE LOBBY AND THE ELEVATOR AND THE STAIRS AND THE TRASH HANDLING ROOM. I WILL TURN OVER THE OTHER DETAILS OF THE PROJECT TO NEIL HERE AND HE CAN RUN THROUGH SOME OF THE OTHER ASPECTS OF THE PROJECT.
01:25:34.925: >> GREAT. ANOTHER COMMUNITY BENEFIT WE ARE PROPOSING AS PART OF THIS PROJECT AND AS A WAY TO ACCESS OUR BUILDING WHICH IS MIDBLOCK, IS AI MIDBLOCK. YOU CAN SEE THE EXISTING CONDITION THERE ON THE LEFT, WHERE THERE'S A HOUSE AT 606 WASHINGTON THERE, AND YOU CAN SEE THE OVERHEAD POWER LAND THERE BETWEEN IT AND LANE HALL. AND THE NEWLY PROPOSED MIDBLOCK CONNECTION ON THE UPPER RIGHT-HAND OF THE SCREEN NOW IS A FEW LOOKING FROM WASHINGTON SOUTH. WHERE WE ARE PROPOSING A WIDE THRUWAY TO GET TO 2912 STATE STREET BUILDING BUT THAT WOULD CONNECT ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE BLOCK TO THE LIBERTY STREET AND YOU CAN SEE THE COMPANION PROJECT AND SOME OF THE COMMERCIAL SPACE FLANKING IT. AND THIS IS DOWN NEAR THE ENTRANCE TO THE RESIDENTIAL PORTION OF THE 212 BUILDING LOOKING NORTH WITH LANE HALL OPEN THE RIGHT. SO THE MIDBLOCK CONNECTION YOU CAN SEE THERE ON THE SITE PLAN, IT'S THIS THROUGH WALKWAY GOING FROM NORTH ALONG WASHINGTON BOULEVARD, ALL WAIT DOWN TO THE ENTRY POINT, THANK YOU, BRETT. THE ENTRY POINT HERE TO THE RESIDENTIAL, SNAKING THROUGH HERE AND ACTUALLY CONTINUING ON THE OTHER PROPERTY ALL THE WAY TO LIBERTY STREET. SO THAT'S THE THROUGH BLOCK CONNECTION. THE FLOOR PLANS OF OUR BUILDING, IT'S TOUGHLY A 2,000 FAIR FOOT T PLACE. IT CONTAINS VERTICAL CIRCULATION. THE LEVEL ONE AS BRAD ALREADY INDICATED. THE WESTERN PORTION OF THAT IS THE MICHIGAN THEATER RESTROOMS AND THAT'S REALLY A SEPARATE COMPONENT TO THE BUILDING AND THE EASTERN HALF HAS THE LOBBY AND THE TRASH ROOM. THE TYPICAL UPPER FLOOR, WE HAVE -- IT'S A CIRCUMSTANCE-STORY BUILDING PROPOSED WITH 19 UNITS, AND TYPICAL UPPER FLOOR CONTAINED STUDIO AND ONE-BEDROOM UNITS AND YOU CAN SEE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE THERE, AND ON THE UPPER FLOORS ONLY THREE. I WILL JUST GO INTO SOME OF THE RENDERINGS HERE. THIS IS A BIRD'S EYE VIEW FROM THE SOUTHEAST. YOU CAN SEE THE COMPANION PROJECT BEHIND, AS WELL AS THE 212 SOUTH STATE STREET HERE IN THE FOREGROUND IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT BLOCK. THIS IS THE VIEW FROM LIBERTY STREET AND THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS WE REVIEWED WITH THE HISTORIC DESIGN COMMISSION BACK EARLIER THIS YEAR, AND SORT OF WHAT IS THE VIEW SHED HERE FROM THIS ANGLE?  ON THE LIBERTY STREET ALLEY. THIS IS THE VIEW. AND THE VIEW SHED FROM STATE STREET, ALSO PART OF THE HISTORIC DISTRICT AND YOU CAN SEE HOW IT BLENDS THERE BEHIND THE SAVA BUILDING AND WAYNE HALL WITH OUR COMPANION PROJECT ON THE HALL. AND ANOTHER VIEW, THE MIDBLOCK, THIS IS THE ENTRANCE TO THE 212 BUILDING, AS  AS WELL AS SOME BICYCLE PARKING AND THEN THE BACK OF THE CSABA BUILDING, THERE IN THE S FOREGROUND. YOU CAN SEE THE CANOPY, THE DISTANCES HERE. AND THERE'S A LOT HAPPENING IN THIS MIDBLOCK CONNECTION, BUT IT'S A -- IT'S REALLY GOING TO BE A NICE EXPERIENCE, AS WE APPROACH THE RESIDENTIAL ENTRY HERE FROM THE MIDBLOCK CONNECTION. AND AGAIN, A VIEW LOOKING BACK AT STATE STREET. THIS IS LANE HALL AND SEVERAL OTHER ADJACENT PROPERTIES IN OUR SELECTION OF A RED-BROWN BRICK COLOR, AS WELL AS A LIGHTER CREAM COLOR MASONRY MATERIAL. WITH THAT, WE WILL LEAVE IT THERE FOR QUESTIONS.
01:29:41.405: >> ONE OF THE OTHER ASPECTS BETWEEN THE SHARED PROJECTS IS THAT THE STORMWATER RETENTION REQUIRED FOR THE 212 PROPERTY WILL BE HANDLED IN A COMMON UNDERGROUND STORAGE ON THE 616 PROPERTY AND THE BICYCLE PARKING THAT IS REQUIRED FOR THE 212 WILL ALSO BE IN THE 616 BUILDING. THAT'S ANOTHER ASPECT OF THE INTEGRATION BETWEEN THE TWO PROJECTS. THE PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING IN THE 212 PROJECT, THE LEASING WILL BE HANDLED BY THE 616. THAT'S PART OF THE INTEGRATION.
01:30:20.143: >> WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO ADDRESS THAT ON THIS OR THE NEXT AGENDA ITEM. THANK YOU.
01:30:25.582: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU. NOW WE GO OVER TO MR. CHANG. I'M HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. PETITIONERS COVERS EVERYTHING THAT I HAVE.
01:30:35.459: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU. I WOULD LIKE TO OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING ON THIS AGENDA ITEM. IS THERE ANYONE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION, THIS IS YOUR OPPORTUNITY. YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES. PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS FOR THE RECORD.
01:30:54.111: >> ETHEL POTTS, 1014 ELDER BOULEVARD. RECENTLY YOU HAD FOR YOUR DISCUSSION AND FOR YOUR ACTION, THE CHARACTER OVERLAY ZONING DISTRICT ON SOUTH UNIVERSITY. BUT YOU HAD NO DISCUSSION. ON THE STANDARDS AND THE INTENT OF THETRICT BEFORE YOU WENT AHEAD AND APPROVED IT. WHAT WILL YOU DO TONIGHT? THIS TIME WE HAVE BEFORE US ALL THE STATE STREET CHARACTER OVERLAY ZONING DISTRICT WITH A NINE-STORY BUILDING PROPOSED AND NO PARKING. MAJOR PROBLEMS WILL RESULT SINCE THE ADJACENT PUBLIC PARKING STRUCTURE IS FULL WITH ONLY VERY LIMITED HOURS OPEN TO THE PUBLIC. I TRIED TO USE IT REGULARLY CAN'T. THE STATE STREET CHARACTER OVERLAY ZONING STATES, WROTE, FROM YOUR CODE, THE INTENT IS PRESERVATION OF THE INTEGRITY OF THE HISTORIC DISTRICT PROPERTIES AND THE OVERALL HISTORIC CHARACTER OF THE AREA IS THE END OF QUOTE. DOES THIS NINE-STORY BUILDING FIT INTO THESE STANDARDS AND INTENTS? NOT AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED. THANK YOU.
01:32:23.366: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN THE AUDIENCE?
01:32:34.644: >> HI, MY NAME IS JIM PIKE. I LIVE AT 912 POMONA ROAD, AND I HAVE WORKED AT THE MICHIGAN THEATER FOR ABOUT 25 YEARS PART TIME, AND I HAVE WORKED ON CENTRAL CAMPUS FOR ABOUT 30 YEARS FULL TIME, AND I'M SUPER EXCITED ABOUT THIS PROJECT. I JUST -- I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT ALL TO SAY, BUT I'M -- I'M JUST -- EVERYTHING I HEAR ABOUT IT, I'M JUST LIKE IN LOVE WITH THIS PROJECT AND ALSO THE NEXT PROJECT THAT IS UP. SO I DON'T REALLY HAVE A LOT TO SAY. OTHER THAN THAT, IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S GOING WELL. I HAVE BEEN TO ONE OF THE DEVELOPER'S PUBLIC MEETINGS THAT HAPPENED A FEW MONTHS AGO AND I'M REALLY, REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS PROJECT AND I REALLY SUPPORT IT, OBVIOUSLY AND I HOPE THAT YOU WILL APPROVE IT. SO THANKS.
01:33:30.767: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU.
01:33:40.110: >> DOUG KILBOT, 223 EAST ANN STREET. NOT FAR FROM HERE. I ALSO SUPPORT THIS BUILDING. THE MORE PEOPLE THAT LIVE DOWNTOWN AND THE MORE PEOPLE THAT WALK AND BIKE AND LESS COMMUTE BY CAR. THEY ALSO LIVE IN SMALLER DWELLING UNITS. JUST LOSTS OF ADVANTAGES TO URBAN LIVING AND THIS PROVIDES A LOT OF UNITS FOR URBAN DWELLERS. I ALSO WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT THIS IS A VERY LONG BLOCK, EITHER MAYNARD OR THOMPSON GO THROUGH. SO HAVING THIS PEDESTRIAN PASS THROUGH LITTLE PEDESTRIAN ALLEY IS REALLY IMPORTANT. IT WILL BE THE SECOND ONE ON THAT VERY LONG BLOCK. IT SORT OF ALIGNS WITH THE ONE BEHIND THE METHODIST CHURCH, WHICH IS GOOD, LIKE THE ONE TO THE SOUTH AND IT ALSO ALIGNS WITH THE ONE NEXT TO THE VARSITY. SO THAT'S CRITICAL. I THINK IT WILL HAVE A LITTLE CHARACTER, THAT LITTLE ALLEYWAY. SO AS AN ARCHITECT, AND PROFESSOR OF ARCHITECTURE AND URBAN DESIGN AND PLANNING, I WOULD LIKE TO CAST A POSITIVE VOTE. THANKS.
01:35:04.094: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU.
01:35:12.268: >> HELLO. I'M JEFF CROCKETT, I LIVE AT 506 EAST KINGSLEY AND I'M HERE TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF THIS PROJECT. I LIKE THE FACT THIS IS -- I'M REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT WHERE DENSITY IS DOWNTOWN, AND THE SURROUNDING AREAS AND I THINK THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE PLACE FOR DENSITY. I'M PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING COMPONENT OF IT AND IT'S INTERESTING TO SEE HOW THIS WORKS. THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING, I LIKE THE FACT THAT IT'S PERMANENT. I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED ABOUT HOW IT'S BASED ON SORT OF INCOME. SO I'M CONFUSED ABOUT THINGS LIKE IF A RESIDENT IS QUALIFIED -- QUALIFIES FOR THE LOW-INCOME HOUSING BUT HE GETS LOWER PAY, DOES THE RENT THEREFORE GO DOWN? THERE'S QUESTIONS ABOUT THE AFFORDABILITY ASPECT OF IT. IF THE MARKET RATE GOES UP BUT HIS INCOME DOESN'T, DOES THE INCOME STAY? SO IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SORT OF TEST THIS OUT, BUT I THINK IT'S -- THE RIGHT TIME TO DO THIS, SO I'M IN FAVOR OF THIS PROJECT.
01:36:19.335: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU.
01:36:26.076: >> HELLO. MY NAME IS EILEEN TYLER. A LIVE AT 126 NORTH DIVISION. I WILL SPEAK BRIEFLY ON EACH OF THE PROJECTS SINCE THERE'S COMPLETELY SEPARATE HEARINGS OFFICIALLY. I SUPPORT THE PROJECT. I THINK THIS IS -- WHAT I HAVE BEEN INTERESTED IN IS HOW THE DEVELOPER HAS EXPLAINED THE PROJECT IN SMALL GROUPS TO PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY THAT HAVE A STAKE IN THIS. AND I FOUND THAT EVERYTHING THEY SAID WAS -- HAS COME ABOUT. I HAVE NEVER FELT THAT THEY HAVE MISLED US ON WHAT THEY COULD DO OR COULDN'T DO OR PROMISED TO DO. BOTH ON THE -- WHO WAS BEING HOUSED IN THE PROPROCT JECT ANDD WHO WAS ALLOWED AND IMPROVING THE DOWNTOWN AND IT CLEANED UP A NUMBER OF ISSUES IN THIS ALLEYWAY, ESPECIALLY THE TRASH PROBLEM THAT IS CURRENTLY QUITE EVIDENT IN THE ALLEY. IT'S -- I HAVE GOTTEN OUT OF CONTROL AT TIMES. IT ADDRESSES THE NEEDS OF THE MICHIGAN THEATER A COOPERATIVE MANNER AND THE PEOPLE INVOLVED HAVE ALSO SUPPORTED IT THIS IS A LOWER SCALE BUILDING MAKING IT A MORE COMPATIBLE IN SCALE AND MATERIAL AND THE ISSUES APPROPRIATE TO THE SECRETARY OF INTERIOR STANDARDS THAT THE HISTORIC DISTRICT COMMISSION REVIEWED IT BY LAST SPRING, AND SO IT REALLY IS DISTINCT FROM THE LARGER BUILDING THAT FRONTS ON TO WASHINGTON STREET. I'M HOPIN THAT THIS WAS NOT TOO CONTROVERSIAL IN YOUR NEGOTIATIONS BUT THAT YOU SEE THIS AS A POSITIVE COMPONENT TO THE DOWNTOWN. THANK YOU.
01:38:01.070: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU.
01:38:09.946: >> SCOTT TRUDEAU. WARD ONE RESIDENT. NICE TO SEE SOME FAMILIAR FACES FROM THIS SIDE OF THE TABLE AND WELCOME TO COMMISSIONERS ABRAMS AND HAMMERSCHMIDT AND THANK YOU FOR VOLUNTEERING. I WOULD LIKE TO JOIN THE PARTY AND SAY I'M ENTHUSIASTICALLY IN SUPPORT OF THIS PROJECT. I THINK IT'S GREAT FOR THE THEATER. IT MAKES EXCELLENT USE OF STRANDED SPACE. IT BLENDS IN REALLY NICELY AND PAIRS WELL WITH THE SISTER PROJECT. AND I ENCOURAGE YOU ALL TO RECOMMEND THIS FOR APPROVAL TO COUCOUNCIL. THANKS.
01:38:48.218: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU.
01:38:51.487: >> TOM STALBERG AGAIN. I WANT TO SUPPORT 212 SOUTH STATE STREET. AS A FORMER HISTORIC DISTRICT COMMISSIONER FOR SIX YEARS, CHAIR FOR TWO, I PAID CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE HISTORIC DISTRICT COMMISSION REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF THIS. I THINK THEY DID QUITE A THOROUGH JOB. THE PETITIONERS IN TERMS OF EXPLAINING AND ADDRESS CONCERNS OF HISTORIC DISTRICT COMMISSION. SO FROM THAT STANDPOINT, I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY THAT I WOULD APPROVE THIS PROJECT. THANK YOU.
01:39:21.851: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU.
01:39:32.829: >> HELLO AND, YES, THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE TO OUR COMMUNITY. MY NAME IS RUSS COLLINS. I LIVE AT 2585 HOLLYWOOD WHICH IS IRONIC IN ANN ARBOR. [ LAUGHTER ] AND I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE MICHIGAN THEATER. WE HAVE WORKED WITH THIS DEVELOPER OVER MANY YEARS AT THIS POINT. AND WE FOUND THAT THEY HAVE BEEN VERY SENSITIVE TO HOW THIS MIGHT IMPACT THE MICHIGAN THEATER. WE -- WE KNEW THAT WE HAD A PROBLEM WITH THE RESTROOMS. IF -- IF WE HAD -- IF WE SOLD THE BUILDING, WHICH IS CALLED THE CADILLAC BUILDING, WHICH WILL BE PART OF THIS OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE A DEEP CONCERN ABOUT HISTORIC PRESERVATION, HAVING WORKED ON RESTORING TWO HISTORIC BUILDINGS. AND -- AND WE ARE VERY HAPPY WITH THE SOLUTIONS FOR THE RESTROOMS. MOST MA PARTICULARLY FOR OUR CUSTOMERS JUST BECAUSE OF THE MORE CONVENIENT LOCATION AND AS TIME GOES ON, IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO ADDRESS THE CURRENT CODE ISSUES. THEY ALSO -- THE DEVELOPERS ALSO PRESERVED THE SCREENING ROOM WHICH IS OUR 200-SEAT THEATER, WHICH WAS BUILT 20 YEARS AGO, WHICH IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF OUR BUSINESS AND COMMUNITY SERVICE IN TERMS OF THE CINEMA PROGRAMMING THAT WE DO AND ALSO KEEPING THE HISTORIC AUDITORIUM AVAILABLE FOR A WIDER COMMUNITY USE AND MORE DIVERSE PROGRAMMING. SO WE FOUND THE DEVELOPER TO LISTEN TO WHAT WE SAID, AND I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT THEY ALSO APPARENTLY LISTENED TO OTHER COMMUNITY INPUT AND CITY INPUT AND HISTORIC DISTRICT INPUT. SO ON BEHALF OF THE MICHIGAN THEATER FOUNDATION, I SUPPORT THE NATURE AND THE QUALITY OF THIS PROJECT.
01:41:20.436: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU.
01:41:22.972: >> I DIDN'T KNOW THAT JIM PIKE WAS GOING TO SHOW UP! [ LAUGHTER ]
01:41:28.711: >> Chair Milshteyn: IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION IN REGARDS TO THIS ITEM? SEEING NO ONE, I -- OH, MR. MOORE.
01:41:37.153: >> I WANT TO CORRECT SOMETHING. IT'S AI SIX-STORY BUILDING, NOT A NINE-STORY BUILDING.
01:41:44.660: >> Chair Milshteyn: SEEING NOBODY ELSE, I WILL CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING AND READ THE MOTION. ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION HEREBY RECOMMENDS THAT THE MAYOR AND THE CITY COUNCIL APPROVE THE 212 SOUTH STATE STREET PLAN AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT SUBJECT TO SHARED ACCESS EASEMENTS FOR SOLID WASTE PICKUP PRIOR TO ISSUANCE OF ANY PERMITS. MOVED BY COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN, SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT. COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN.
01:42:06.949: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR AND THANKS TO THE MEMBERS THE PUBLIC WHO DISCUSSED. THIS I THINK I SHARE YOUR ENTHUSIASM. I THINK IT'S A CREATIVE USE OF SPACE, MIDBLOCK BUILDING IS NOT SOMETHING YOU SEE VERY OFTEN, THE ABILITY TO ACTIVATE OTHERWISE COMPLETELY VACANT ALLEYS IS EXCITING TO BRING, YOU KNOW, VIBRANCY TO A PART OF THE CITY THAT OTHERWISE WOULD LAY DORMANT. SO THAT'S REALLY EXCELLENT AND I APPRECIATE THAT THIS IS A PROJECT THAT INCORPORATES OR A PART OF A SET OF PRO  JOKES THAT INCORPORATES AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNDER OUR PREMIUM. IT'S ONE OF THE FIRST TWO THAT DO SO. AND AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH HOPEFULLY NEW ZONING, PREMIUMS INTO THE FUTURE, YOU WILL BE JOINED BY OTHER NEIGHBORS SHOULD THIS P MOVE FORWARD THAT INCORPORATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AS WELL. I HAD ONE QUESTION ABOUT THE MATERIALS ON THE TOP TWO FLOORS IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. I SEE THE FIBER CEMENT IN THE SITE PLAN. MR. LENART, CAN YOU REMIND US, IS FIBER CEMENT ALLOWED IN THE DOWNTOWN AS OF 2017?
01:43:20.690: >> THE ORDINANCE REQUIRES HIGH-QUALITY ARCHITECTURAL MATERIALS AND EXCLUSIVELY ELIMINATES DRIVET OR VINYL. SO I BELIEVE IT WOULD MEET THAT TEST.
01:43:34.303: >> Councilmember Ackerman: OKAY. A SUBJECTIVE TEST, BUT FAIR ENOUGH AND I WON'T GUM UP THE WORKS. SO I APPRECIATE THAT. AND I'M EXCITED TO SEE THIS PROJECT MOVE FORWARD.
01:43:47.850: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER SAUVE.
01:43:50.853: >> Commissioner Sauve: I APPRECIATE A LOT OF SUPPORT. THERE'S QUITE LEVITY TO THIS GROUP, WHICH IS REFRESHING ON THIS SIDE OF THE TABLE.
01:43:59.228: >> Chair Milshteyn: RARE.
01:43:59.795: >> Commissioner Sauve: I DO WANT TO ASK THE DEVELOPER TO KIND OF ADDRESS THE TWO QUESTIONS THAT DID COME UP IN COMMENT. ONE IS IF YOU COULD DISCUSS MAYBE WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE HISTORIC REVIEW AS IT RELATES TO THE OVERLAY. AND JUST KIND OF GIVE US WHAT THAT FEEDBACK WAS. AND THE OTHER, IF YOU CAN TELL US A BIT MORE ABOUT THE AFFORDABILITY AGREEMENT. IN PLACE FOR THE PREMIUM.
01:44:27.156: >> NEAL CAN PROBABLY ADDRESS A LITTLE BUILT MORE AT THE HISTORIC DISTRICT. THE AFFORDABILITY OF THESE COMBINED PROJECTS IS -- IS AN OFFICIAL COMPONENT OF THE 616 PROJECT, 19 AFFORDABLE UNITS IN. THIS PROJECT, WE ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS AFFORDABILITY BY BUILDING MICROSTUDIOS WHICH WILL BE SMALLER IN NATURE, 360 SQUARE FEET FOR MOST OF THE MICRO STUDIOS SO THEIR RENTS WILL BE LESSER BECAUSE OF THEM BEING SMALLER BUT THE PERMANENT AFFORDABLE UNITS WHICH WE CAN SPEAK MORE ABOUT THE MECHANISMS THAT WILL BE PART OF THE 616 PROJECT AND MAYBE NEIL CAN SPEAK ABOUT THE CHANGES AND ADAPTATIONS THAT WERE INCORPORATED AS A RESULT OF THE TWO MEETINGS WE HAD AT THE HISTORIC DISTRICT.
01:45:14.570: >> WE HAD TWO MEETINGS EARLIER THIS YEAR WITH THE HDC, PRIMARY CHANGES FROM THOSE MEETINGS WERE AT ONE POINT, WE HAD SOME LIGHTING ON THE BILLING. WE WERE DRAWING ATTENTION TO THE BUILDING, AND SO A MAJOR COMPONENT OF THE CHANGES THAT WE ADDRESSED WAS TO REALLY LET THIS BUILDING ALLOW IT TO FADE INTO THE BACKGROUND. IN OTHER WORDS, LET THE BUILDINGS, THE HISTORIC BUILDINGS THAT DESIGN THE DISTRICT ALONG LIBERTY AND STATE STREET STILL DEFINE THE DISTRICT. THIS IS A BACK OF HOUSE BUILDING TO THE 212 PARCEL, THE CSABA PARCEL AND ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAD -- AND ONE OF THE THINGS HOW MUCH BRICK? WHERE SHOULD IT TIME OUT AND WHERE ARE THE OPENINGS AND JUST ALLOWING THIS BUILDING TO SORT OF JUST BUILD ITSELF IN AS FABRIC RATHER THAN TO TRY TO STAND OUT AS A -- AS APRIL HISTORIC RECESS WHICH IT IS NOT. IT'S AN HISTORIC BUILDING.
01:46:10.159: >> ONE OF THE THINGS THAT EVERYONE WOULD HAVE LIKED, IS THE FACT THAT IT WILL OBSCURE A VERY UNPLEASANT VIEW OF THE HVAC EQUIPMENT ON THE ROOF TOP OF THE MICHIGAN THEATER BUILDING, WHICH IS -- IF YOU LOOK DOWN EITHER LIBERTY OR DOWN THE GAP BETWEEN CSABA'S AND LANE HALL, IT'S LIKE GIANT MENTAL MONSTERS DESCENDED FROM HEAVEN AND PERCHED THERE.
01:46:41.624: >> PARTICULARLY THOSE AT LIBERTY AND STATE.
01:46:48.264: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER ABRONS.
01:46:49.832: >> Commissioner Abrons:  MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT YOU DON'T CONTROL THE SOUTHERN MOST PORTION OF THE THROUGH BLOCK; IS THAT CORRECT?
01:46:55.871: >> YES SO THE SOUTHERN PORTION, WHICH RUNS BETWEEN THE MICHIGAN OFFICE BUILDING AND THE SALAD SHOP IS SPLIT OWNERSHIP BETWEEN THOSE TWO BUILDINGS, WITH A SMALL PORTION OF THE WESTERN SIDE OF THE T BEING OWNED BY MICHIGAN THEATER. SO THERE'S ACTUALLY THREE OWNERS IN THAT AREA AND WE ARE WORKING OUT AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THOSE THREE OWNERS TO ALLOW US TO IMPROVE PROPER -- BUT SINCE WE DON'T OWN THAT, THAT PORTION WOULD BE DONE UNDER A DIFFERENT PERMITTING PROCESS. SO IT'S NOT PART OF THE SITE PLAN HERE.
01:47:33.442: >> Commissioner Abrons:  BUT YOU HAVE BEEN IN CONVERSATION WITH THEM ABOUT CONTINUITY.
01:47:38.414: >> ABSOLUTELY. REPAVING IT BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IT'S A MINEFIELD OF POTHOLES LIKE A LOT OF MICHIGAN ROADS. YELL, WITYES, WE WILL TAKE CAREF REPAVING THAT AND PUT SOME SECURITY LIGHTING IN AS WELL.
01:47:53.028: >> Commissioner Abrons:  THANK YOU. THAT'S IT.
01:47:55.164: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER BRIGGS.
01:47:56.766: >> Commissioner Briggs: THE ONLY CONCERN I HAVE ABOUT THIS BUILDING OR MAYBE THE QUESTION, IS REGARDING THE BIKE PARKING. AND SO I WAS WONDERING, THIS IS A COMPLETELY SEPARATE BUILDING IN TERMS OF CONNECTIONS, RIGHT? YOU HAVE -- AND SO IN TERMS OF -- MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE NEXT PROJECT THAT WE TALK ABOUT IS HOUSING THE BIKE PARKING FOR THIS BUILDING. AND SO --
01:48:21.090: >> THERE WILL BE A CROSS ACCESS BETWEEN THESE TWO BUILDINGS.
01:48:25.394: >> Commissioner Briggs: RIGHT. I'M SURE THAT IT'S MUCH MORE EFFICIENT TO HAVE IT IN THE OTHER BUILDING, ALL OF IT GROUPED TOGETHER BUT IN TERMS OF THE RESIDENTS OF THIS BUILDING, IS IT ANTICIPATED THAT THOSE -- THAT THAT BIKE PARKING IS BIKE PARKING BEING USED IN THE WINTER OR WHAT'S -- IN TERMS OF PRACTICALITY OF IT BEING USED.
01:48:58.060: >> THERE'S ACCESS TO A BASEMENT OR BELOW GRADE BIKE PARKING ROOM CLASS A SECURED BIKE PARKING ROOM THAT'S HERE AND THAT ACCESS IS BETWEEN THE TWO BUILDINGS AND THEN RIGHT ALONG IN THIS AREA HERE, WE HAVE SOME CLASS B OUTDOOR BIKE PARKING AND WE TRY TO LOCATE IT BETWEEN THE TWO BUILDINGS AND IT WILL BE CONVENIENT USE FOR THE PEOPLE. THEY DON'T HAVE TO GO ALL THE WAY AROUND TO THE WEST SIDE OF THE BUILDING TO GET ACCESS TO THE BIKE PARKING.
01:49:24.320: >> Commissioner Briggs: SO THAT'S KIND OF WHERE THEY WOULD BE GOING IN AND OUT?
01:49:27.523: >> YES. CORRECT.
01:49:30.159: >> Commissioner Briggs: OKAY. CAN YOU TALK ABOUT WHERE IT'S LOCATED IN THE OTHER BUILDINGS IN TERMS OF UNDERSTANDING THAT ARRANGEMENT A LITTLE BIT BETTER?
01:49:35.331: >> I WOULD HAVE TO CYCLE THROUGH A DIFFERENT PRESENTATION.
01:49:43.105: >> Commissioner Briggs: YOU CAN SAY IT.
01:49:44.974: >> IT'S RIGHT BELOW THIS AREA IN THE BASEMENT, RIGHT AT THE BASE OF THAT STAIR TOWER AND IT RUNS OVER TO THAT STAIR TOWER.
01:49:52.047: >> Commissioner Briggs: SO DO FOLKS GO IN -- DOWN A SET OFS OFSTAIRS WITH THEIR BIKES.
01:49:57.586: >> YES, IT'S SIMILAR TO THE GRADUATE DORMITORY AT U OF M, WHERE THIS HAVE SLATS WHERE THE BIKE TIRES RIDE.
01:50:06.695: >> Commissioner Briggs: OKAY. AND THERE WAS NOT AN OPPORTUNITY TO INCLUDE ANY INDOOR PARKING AT THIS BUILDING?
01:50:11.667: >> NOT ON THE SITE OF 212.
01:50:15.371: >> Commissioner Briggs: OKAY.
01:50:16.005: >> YEAH, I MEAN, IF WE DECIDED NOT TO GIVE THE EXTRA BATHROOM SPACE TO THE THEATER, THAT WOULDV. BUT THAT WAS OUR PRIORITY.
01:50:26.282: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL.
01:50:28.083: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: I'M STRUGGLING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW TO KIND OF KNIT OR KEEP THESE -- KNIT TOGETHER OR KEEP THESE PROJECTS APART BECAUSE IF I JUST LOOK AT THIS ONE, I THINK THERE'S SO MANY POSITIVE THINGS. I HAVE SOME ISSUES WITH THE OTHER ONE AND THERE MAY BE SOME WAYS TO BE ABLE TO CREATE SOME OPPORTUNITIES IF THIS CHANGES IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO APPEASE SOME OF MY FEELINGS ABOUT THE OTHER ONE. SO I'M NOT QUITE SURE HOW TO HANDLE THIS BECAUSE I KNOW WE'RE SUPPOSED TO APPROVE THIS AND MOVE ON, BUT -- BUT I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHAT TO DO WITH -- BECAUSE THEY ARE KIND OF TOGETHER AND KIND OF NOT. SO PERHAPS YOU COULD GIVE US SOME DIRECTION ON --
01:51:11.527: >> Chair Milshteyn: WE COULD ALWAYS TABLE IT AND VOTE ON THEM -- AND VOTE ON THIS PROJECT AND VOTE ON IT RIGHT AFTER.
01:51:19.535: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: OKAY.
01:51:21.737: >> Chair Milshteyn: I DON'T SEE WHY WE CAN'T TABLE IT AND VOTE ON IT LATER.
01:51:25.174: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: THAT SOUNDS GOOD.
01:51:28.277: >> Chair Milshteyn: UNLESS THERE'S A OBJECTION FROM THE COMMISSION MEMBERS ON THAT. MY INITIAL THOUGHT WAS TO BRING BOTH OF THOSE TOGETHER. BUT IT WOULD STILL REQUIRE TWO PUBLIC HEARINGS. BUT I HAVE NO OPPOSITION TO TABLING IT UNTIL LATER IN THE MEETING.
01:51:48.197: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: OKAY.
01:51:50.265: >> Chair Milshteyn: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT.
01:51:52.968: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: I HAVE A FEW THINGS. TWO THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO THIS BUILDING. I KNOW WE ARE NOT NECESSARILY SUPPOSED TO COMMENT ON THE ACTUAL DESIGN OF THE BUILDING, BUT I'M JUST CURIOUS, JUST FROM LIKE THE SITE PLANS ARE THERE WINDOWS IN THE STAIRWELLS? BECAUSE THIS IS A SIX-STORY BUILDING. I FEEL LIKE PEOPLE SHOULD TAKE THE STAIRWELL AND IF IT'S A CRAPPY STAIRWELL, THEY WON'T DO THAT.
01:52:26.035: >> LET ME BROWSE TO --
01:52:29.004: >> WITH YOUR MOUSE WHEEL.
01:52:30.806: >> WELL, THERE WE ARE. WELL, WE WERE THERE. OKAY. I THINK THAT'S IT. OKAY. SO IF YOU LOOK -- LET ME POINT TO THE RIGHT SPOT. THE STAIRWELLS, I ASSUME IT'S THE EASTERN ELEVATION ON THE SOUTHERN STAIRWELL, THAT'S THE WINDOW LOCATION. THERE IS NOT A WINDOW LOCATED IN THAT STAIRWELL AT THIS TIME. YEAH. THAT STAIRWELL HAS SHIFTED AROUND. AND AS WE ADDRESS SOME --
01:53:01.003: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: THE ONE WE HAD, HAD IT IN A DIFFERENT LOCATION. THE ONE THAT WE GOT WAS DIFFERENT.
01:53:10.012: >> RIGHT THERE. WAS A PREVIOUS ITERATION OF IT, WHERE THE STAIR SHIFTED. I MEAN, REALLY THAT CHANGE CAME -- AS PARTIALLY DRIVEN BY ACCOMMODATING TRASH IN THAT LOWER SOUTHEASTERN PORTION OF THE BUILDING AND THE TRASH FROM THE OTHER BUILDINGS ON THE BLOCK.
01:53:24.259: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: OKAY. I DO APPRECIATE THAT YOU DON'T JUST OPEN THE DOOR AND IMMEDIATELY SEE THE ELEVATOR AND MAKES PEOPLE HAVE -- YOU KIND OF HAVE TO WALK THROUGH. YOU HAVE A CHOICE ON WHAT YOU DO. SO HOPEFULLY PEOPLE WHO LIVE ON THE SECOND AND THIRD FLOORS AND PEOPLE WHO LIVE ON FIFTH AND SIXTH FLOORS WILL STAY THE STAIRS. WILL RESIDENTS BE ABLE TO ACCESS THE AMENITIES OF THE OTHER BUILDING?
01:53:49.685: >> THAT'S CORRECT. BRETT?
01:53:50.786: >> THAT IS THE INTENT, THEY WOULD HAVE TO THE MAIL ROOM AND THE PATIOS, THE POOL AND SO FORTH.
01:54:01.096: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: OKAY. EXCELLENT. I LOVE THE ALLEYIVATION. ALLEY ACTIVATION. I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT UP SECURITY LIGHTING BECAUSE I WAS A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED, ESPECIALLY SINCE THIS BUILDING HAS ACCESS OFF THE ALLEY THAT PEOPLE FEEL SAFE WHEN THEY ARE WALKING THROUGH AT NIGHT.
01:54:19.481: >> YES, THERE WILL BE SECURITY LIGHTING IN BOTH DIRECTIONS, BOTH NORTH AND SOUTH AND SO THE WHOLE WAY WILL BE LIT AND THERE'S ALSO SECURITY CAMERAS IN THERE AND THEY ARE MONITORED BY THE PERP PERSONNEL IN THE 616 BUILDING.
01:54:32.194: >> AND ONE LAST THING. THE -- IN THE PICTURE YOU SHOWED OF EXISTING, VERSUS THE RENDERING, THERE'S A POWER LINE. IS THAT GOING TO BE BURIED OR HOW --
01:54:42.070: >> YES, ANYTHING THAT RUNS CURRENTLY OVERHEAD THROUGH THE SITE WILL BE BURIED.
01:54:50.245: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU.
01:54:53.248: >> Chair Milshteyn: MR. CHANG, ONE QUICK QUESTION IN REGARDS TO THE WAY THIS COMES BEFORE US, THIS IS FAIRLY UNIQUE TO HAVE TWO SITES. IS THERE A REASON WHY THEY WERE NOT MERGED INTO ONE LOT?
01:55:05.561: >> ONE IS IN THE HISTORIC DISTRICT.
01:55:08.463: >> Chair Milshteyn: GOT IT! A KEPT LOOKING AT, THINKING WHAT IS WRONG HERE? THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE. AND THEN A QUESTION FOR THE PETITIONER. IN REGARDS TO THE CONSTRUCTION, STAGING AND HOW THAT IS ALL GOING TO OCCUR, IS THERE A PLAN FOR WHAT'S GOING TO BE BUILT FIRST AND HOW THAT WILL ALL GO?
01:55:30.252: >> YES, SO THE SEQUENCING WOULD BE -- AND IT HAS TO BE DONE THIS WAY. THE 212 BUILDING IS THE FIRST THING TO GET BUILT. WE NEED TO HAVE THE NEW BATHROOM FACILITIES UP AND OPERATIONAL BEFORE WE CAN DEMOLISH THE OLD FACILITIES WHICH WE NEED TO DO TO BUILD THE HIGH RAISE. SO THIS IS DEFINITELY THE PHASE ONE.
01:55:51.640: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU. AND DO YOU HAVE A TIMELINE FOR CONSTRUCTION, IF ALL GOES WELL?
01:55:55.777: >> YES SO WE WOULD HOPE TO BE ABLE TO START EARLY SPRIN
01:56:01.350: >> Chair Milshteyn: AND BE DONE?
01:56:02.451: >> I THINK THERE'S ABOUT A 16 TO 18 MONTH OVERALL CONSTRUCTION PERIOD FOR BOTH PROJECTS.
01:56:08.490: >> OKAY. THANK YOU.
01:56:10.993: >> Chair Milshteyn: FURTHER DISCUSSION. DO I HAVE A MOTION TO TABLE UNTIL ITEM 10-B? MOVED BY COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL. SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER BRIGGS. ANY DISCUSSION ON TABLING? ALL THOSE IN FAVOR, PLEASE SAY AYE. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? ALL RIGHT. IT'S TABLED TO WHAT WILL NOW BE 10-C. ALL RIGHT. MOVING ON TO THE NEXT ITEM ON OUR AGENDA WHICH IS 616 EAST WASHINGTON STREET. NEW HIGH-RISE DEVELOPMENT SITE PLAN FOR CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL. WE WILL ONCE AGAIN BEGIN WITH THE PETITIONER PRESENTATION AND THEN MOVE ON TO A STAFF REPORT, PUBLIC HEARING, AND THEN A MOTION, A DISCUSSION AND A VOTE.
01:57:03.845: >> OKAY. SO SOME OF THESE MAY BE FAMILIAR. THIS IS, OF COURSE, THE LOCATION. THIS IS A RENDERING LOOKING NORTH. YOU ARE PROBABLY FAMILIAR WITH THE SITE AS WE PLANNED IN THE LAST. THE RED IN THIS CASE IS THE 616 PROJECT. THIS IS A STREET VIEW OF THE EXISTING HOMES, SOME OF WHICH HAVE BEEN BETTER TAKEN CARE OF, OR LESS BETTER TAKEN CARE OF BY PREVIOUS OWNERS. THEY ARE NOT IN A GREAT STATE OF REPAIR. THE CODE SUMMARY IS HERE. WE ARE THE FIRST PROJECT TO ASK FOR -- AS FAR AS I KNOW, FIRST PROJECT TO ASK FOR THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING PREMIUM THAT'S BEEN IN THE CODE FOR A LONG TIME. THE PROBLEM HAS ALWAYS BEEN THAT BY THE TIME YOU GET TO YOUR 700% PREMIUM, YOU ARE HITTING THAT MAXIMUM HEIGHT THAT'S IN A LOT OF THE CODE AND SO WE ARE ASKING FOR A PLANNED PROJECT STATUS SO THAT WE CAN GO UP A LITTLE BIT HIGHER IN ORDER TO GET THAT ADDITIONAL SQUARE FOOTAGE FOR THE AFFORDABILITY. AND SO WE ARE AT 898 PROPOSED F.A.R. WE ARE PROVIDING A NUMBER OF PLANNED PROJECT QUALIFIERS, INCLUDING MORE OPEN SPACE THAN IS REQUIRED. WE HAVE HAVE AROUND 9500 SQUARE FEET OF OPEN SPACE ON THE SITE. IT'S ABOUT A 33% OPEN SPACE ON THE SITE COMBINED TO INCLUDE BOTH THE SQUARE FOOTAGE ON THE GROUND AND ALSO AT THE TWO TERRACE LEVELS. WE HAVE BUILDING SETBACKS THAT ARE GREATER THAN REQUIRED AND THEY VARY DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU ARE ON THE SITE. WE HAVE GIVEN A BRIEF SUMMARY OF WHERE THOSE INCREASES ARE. AND WE HAVE ENERGY-CONSERVING BUILDING DESIGN, INCLUDING SOLAR PANELS ON THE BUILDING. THE BUILDING WILL BE DESIGNED AND BUILT TO LEEDS SILVER STANDARD. WE PLAN TO PUT A SOLAR VOLUNTARY VOLTAICARRAY ON THE ROOF. WE PLAN TO PUT 8500-KILOWATTS ON THE BUILDING. AND THIS HAS THE MIDBLOCK CONNECTION, OFFERING PEDESTRIANS A WAY TO GET BETWEEN THE TWO STREETS, LIBERTY AND WASHINGTON. AND IT'S PEDESTRIAN-ORIENTED BECAUSE OF ITS -- IT LIES ON A MAJOR BUS ROUTE. YOU CAN PICK UP THE BUS IN FRONT OF THIS BUILDING AND GO ALL THE WAY TO CANTON. IT'S REALLY WELL INTEGRATED US ABOUT PLAN. WE ARE PROVIDING ON-SITE PARKING AS WELL. WHEN WE ORIGINALLY STARTED, WE HAD A BILLING THAT WAS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF 225 FEET IN HEIGHT AND SOME OF THE FEEDBACK THAT WE GOT IN MEETING WITH NEIGHBORS WAS THAT THEY FELT IT WAS TOO TALL AND WE WORKED ON REDUCING THE FLOOR-TO-FLOOR HEIGHTS AND CHANGING THE STRUCTURAL SYSTEM AND WE HAVE GOTTEN IT DOWN SO THAT THERE ARE TWO PARAPET HEIGHTS, ONE IS 206 AND THE OTHER IS 208 AND THAT INCREASES THE 180-FOOT LIMIT IN THAT DISTRICT, WHICH PARALLELS THE INCREASE THAT THE PLANNING COMMISSION WAS TALKING ABOUT MOST RECENTLY IN THEIR DISCUSSIONS OF HOW WE COULD ENCOURAGE MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SO WE ARE RIGHT ON THAT 15% INCREASE. THIS IS I ACOMPARISON TO SOME OF THE OTHER BUILDING IN TOWN THAT ARE TALL. WE'RE JUST SNEAKING IN UNDER UPPER TOWER AND UNIVERSITY TOWERS AND WE ARE WELL UNDER THE HEIGHT OF TOWER PLAZA. SOME OF THE BUILDINGS THAT I JUST MENTIONED. AGAIN, THERE ARE NUMEROUS COMMUNITY BENEFITS, SOME OF WHICH WE TALKED ABOUT, FIXING THE TRASH PROBLEM. WE HAVE $150,000 PARKING IN THIS CONTRIBUTION. WE ARE REDUCING THE NUMBER OF CURB CUTS. WE ARE CONSOLIDATING THIS DOWN TO ONE CURB CUT. WE HOPE TO HAVE A LOADING ZONE IN FRONT OF THE BUILDING AND WE ARE WORKING WITH THE D.D.A. TO FIND THE APPROPRIATE SPOT. AND THERE ARE 19 AFFORDABLE UNITS. WE ARE WORKING WITH THE COUNTY WHO WOULD DO THE VETTING OF THE PEOPLE WHO WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR THOSE UNITS. HERE WE ARE SHOWING A MIXTURE OF WHAT THE UNITS MIGHT BE. 12% ONE-BEDROOM UNITS AND 21% TWO-BEDROOM UNITS. COUNTY WOULD ALSO BE ONGOING VETTING. SO THAT PEOPLE'S INCOME FLUCTUATED, THE COUNTY WOULD BE THE ONES THAT ARE LETTING US KNOW THOSE PEOPLE QUALIFIED FOR THE RENT. THE CURRENT IDEA IS THAT IF YOU ARE A SINGLE PERSON AND YOU GOT AN APARTMENT, BECAUSE YOU QUALIFIED AND YOU GOT MARRIED AND YOUR INCOME WENT UP, THE IDEA IS THAT THEN ANOTHER UNIT THAT WOULD BECOME AVAILABLE FOR LEASE WOULD THEN GET THE AFFORDABLE DESIGNATION SO YOU WOULD NOT BE FORCED  TO MOVE OU, BUT YOU WOULD GO TO MARKET RENT. AND THIS IS TRASH STUFF THAT WE TALKED ABOUT, SHOWING MORE CONSOLIDATION, AND THE BATHROOMS AND THE MIDBLOCK THAT WE DISCUSSED. AND THIS IS THE LOWER LEVEL BIKE PARKING AREA THAT YOU ASKED ABOUT. WHEN YOU COME DOWN THIS RAMP WITH A BICYCLE, THEN YOU HAVE ALL OF THIS SPACE DOWN HERE. WE ARE REQUIRED TO PRODUCE BETWEEN THE TWO PROJECTS ABOUT 106 PARKING SPACES FOR BIKES AND WE HAVE 246. SO WE ARE MORE THAN DOUBLING THE NUMBER OF BIKES THAT ARE REQUIRED ON SITE. I THINK I WILL LET NEIL GET INTO THE REST OF THE DESIGN FROM THE FIRST FLOOR UP.
02:02:40.815: >> SURE. OVERVIEWING THE FLOOR PLANS HERE FOR YOU. HERE ON THE 616 BUILDING, YOU ENTER THE BIL BUILDING HERE. THE ONE CURB CUT FROM WASHINGTON. I FLIP BACK TO THE SITE PLAN TO LET YOU NO HE VERY BRIEFLY THAT THOSE ARE THE PARKING STALLS THAT ARE COMING BACK AND THE BOULEVARD CONCEPT THAT THEY WILL BE ALLUDING TO IN A FUTURE RENDERING HERE THAT I WILL PUT UP IN A MINUTE. FLOOR ONE, AGAIN, YOU ENTER -- THE VEHICLES ENTER THE BUILDING THIS WAY. THERE'S TRASH COLLECTION HAPPENING HERE. THERE'S TRASH STORAGE FACILITY HERE. THERE'S SOME E UTILITARIAN ROOMS HERE AND COMMERCIAL SPACE WITH PROPOSED OUTDOOR SEATING UNDER AN OVERHANG IN THAT LOCATION. AGAIN, THE BIKE PARKING ACCESS. ONE OF THE THINGS WE ARE DOING HERE IS SEVERAL POINTS OF EGRESS FOR THE SCREENING ROOM THAT HAPPEN COMING OUT OF OUR BUILDING LIKE THIS TO THE EAST AS WELL AS COMING OUT OF OUR BUILDING FROM AN UPPER LEVEL, DOWN AND THEN OUT TO THE WEST TO THE ALLEY BACK HERE. ELEVATOR CORE, STAIR, LEVELS 2 THROUGH 5 OF THE BUILDING ARE PARKING. SO THERE'S THREE FULL LEVELS OF PARKING. THEY ARE ALL VERY SIMILAR. LEVEL TWO IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WITH A NOTCHED OUT AREA FOR TRASH LOADING, WHICH IS A TWO-STORY VOLUME. SO WE WORKED WITH THE TRASH, THE SOLID WASTE COLLECTION FOLKS THERE TO DETERMINE HOW TO DO THAT WELL. HERE'S THE TYPICAL PARKING PLATE. AND THEN HERE'S THE UPPER LEVEL PARKING, AGAIN THE RAMP GOING UP LIKE THAT -- LIKE SO ON EACH LEVEL. YOU CAN SEE THE UNIT DISPERSION THERE AMONG THE DIFFERENT UNIT TYPES, AS WELL AS THE VERTICAL CIRCULATION AND LOCATIONS. ADDITIONALLY ON THIS FLOOR, WE HAVE SOME AMENITIES LOCATED HERE AND HERE WITH AN OUTDOOR ROOF DECK HERE. THERE'S ADDITIONALLY A TERRACE AND SMALL UNIT TERRACES THAT FACE THE COMPANION PROJECT THERE ON THE SOUTHEAST. THE TYPICAL FLOOR PLAN WITH SOME LARGER UNITS NEAR CORNERS, YOU CAN SEE THERE THE DISPERSION OF ONE AND STUDIO UNITS THROUGHOUT THE FLOOR PLAN. WHEN WE GET TO THE 18th LEVEL, THE SOUTHEAST PORTION OF THE BUILDING CUTS BACK AND TWO-STORY VOLUME IS REMOVED FOR IT TO BE REALLY 17 STORIES OF BUILDING AT THAT LOCATION AND THERE'S AN AMENITY DECK OUTDOOR SPACE HERE, AS WELL AS A TWO-STORY VOLUME OF INDOOR AMENITY RIGHT THERE ON THE NORTHEAST CORNER OF THE BUILDING. THE REST OF THAT FLOOR PLATE IS UNITS. AGAIN HERE AT FLOOR 19, DIFFERENCE HERE BEING THAT THERE'S SOME OUTDOOR MECHANICAL SPACE THAT IS CONCEALED, AND SCREENED, ALONG THE SOUTH SIDE HERE, SO IT'S REALLY NOT VISIBLE FROM THE STREET, NOT VISIBLE FROM THE GROUND, WHATSOEVER. AND HIDDEN AWAY. THERE'S THAT SECOND STORY VOLUME OF THE AMENITY SPACE. MOVING UP TO THE ROOF PLAN, AS ALREADY MENTIONED, WE HAVE REALLY MAXIMIZED THE SOLAR POTENTIAL OF THIS ROOF WITH ALL THE OTHER COMPONENTS THAT NEED TO HAPPEN UP ON THE ROOF. SO YOU CAN SEE HERE THOSE AREAS IN YELLOW, WHICH ARE THE SOLAR PANELS. SO AS BRAD ALREADY ALLUDED TO, 85,000KWH. SO THAT'S EQUIVALENT OF EIGHT -- I'M SORRY, 11 MICHIGAN HOMES WHICH IS EQUALLY EQUIVALENT TO ABOUT 30 STUDIO APARTMENT UNITS. SO THAT IS THE SOLAR METRICS. THIS RENDERING IS FROM THE NORTHEAST, KIND OF A BIRD'S EYE, LOOKING AT MAINLY THE WASHINGTON STREET FACADE. YOU HAVE SEEN THIS ONE BEFORE, FROM THE SOUTHEAST LOOKING AT THE BACK SIDE OF THE BUILDING. THIS VIEW WOULD BE FROM WASHINGTON AND STATE FROM THE NORTHEAST PORTION. THEN MOVING CLOSER KIND OF ACROSS THE STREET AT WASHINGTON, LOOKING AT THE MAIN ENTRY POINT, THE RESIDENTIAL LOBBY AND YOU CAN SEE THE MATERIALITY AND SOME OF THE DESIGN ASPECTS THE PODIUM LEVEL OF THE BUILDING, THE PARKING AND THE LEVEL ONE TOGETHER. A VIEW FROM WHAT WE FEEL IS A PRETTY VIBRANT PROPOSED STREETSCAPE HERE ALONG THE BOULEVARD ON WASHINGTON. WE THINK THERE'S A STRONG ACTIVATION OF THIS STREET WITH HOW WE ARE DOING THE APPROACHES AND THE SETBACKS THERE. AGAIN, THE PODIUM DESIGN, YOU HAVE SEEN THIS ONE ALREADY. THE VIEW SOUTH FROM WASHINGTON LOOKING AT THE MIDBLOCK CONNECTION. AND SOME OF THE OTHER MIDBLOCK CONNECTION RENDERINGS THERE. AGAIN, MATERIALITY, WE ARE -- WE SPOKE TO THIS ON THE LAST PROJECT AND THE USE OF THE TWO MASONRY COLORS.
02:07:17.425: >> Chair Milshteyn: ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU.
02:07:18.526: >> I WANTED TO ADD WE MADE TWO PRESENTATIONS BEFORE THE DESIGN REVIEW BOARD IN THIS CASE, JUST LIKE WE DID AT THE HDC AND SO WE DID MORE THAN REQUIRED. ABOUT 75% OF THE UNITS BETWEEN THE TWO BUILDINGS ARE STUDIOS ONES AND TWOS. WE ARE TRYING TO ATTRACT A NONSTUDENT COMPONENT AS WELL. SO WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF LARGE BEDROOM COUNTS AND WE HAVE BEEN WORKING DILIGENTLY WITH OUR NEIGHBORS ACRO ACROSS THE STREER THE IMPACT ON THE CHURCH BUILDING CROSS STREET.
02:07:55.763: >> Chair Milshteyn: AND NOW WE WELCOME BACK MR. KAHAN FOR THE STAFF REPORT.
02:08:00.034: >> I WANTED TO ADD OR REINFORCE THAT THE PETITIONER IS PROVIDING STORMWATER DETENTION IN A VAULT IN THE LOWEST LEVEL IN THE BASEMENT LEVEL. IT'S A RECTANGULAR VAULT. MOSTLY IN THE NORTHEAST PORTION OF THE -- OF THE BASEMENT OF THE STRUCTURE. STAFF RECOMMENDS APPROVAL OF THE PLANNED PROJECT SITE PLAN BECAUSE IT COMPLIES WITH ALL THE APPLICABLE, LOCAL AND STATE ORDINANCES AND REGULATIONS. IT WILL NOT CAUSE A PUBLIC OR PRIVATE NUISANCE AND WILL NOT HAVE A DETRIMENTAL EFFECT ON PUBLIC HEALTH, SAFETY OR WELFARE. AND STAFF FURTHER RECOMMENDS APPROVAL OF THE PLANNED PROJECT MODIFICATION BECAUSE THE PROJECT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE STANDARDS OF APPROVAL FOR PLANNED PROJECTS IN THE UNIFIED PLANNED SITE PLAN MODIFICATION.
02:08:52.987: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU. MR. LENART.
02:08:55.556: >> IF I COULD JUST ADD TO JEFF'S SUMMARY, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT FROM A STAFF PERSPECIFICKIVE, THAT WE CONSIDERED WITH THIS, WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE WITH THE 900% PREMIUM AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS AND YOU WILL RECALL THAT ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF A PLANNED PROJECT MODIFICATION IS THE PRO E VISION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING ITSELF. AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE WORKED WITH, I THINK SUCCESSFULLY WITH THE PETITIONER IS TO TRY AND RECOGNIZE SOME LEVEL OF DIFFERENTIATION, THAT IS THE PROVISION OF SOME OF THOSE AFFORDABLE UNITS IS SORT OF THE C TO THE F.A.R. INCREASE. AND PLANNED PROJECT MODIFICATIONS, WE WERE WORKING WITH THEM TO SEEK SOME ADDITIONAL POTENTIAL BENEFITS AND DESIGNING THIS BUILDING TO A LEEDS SILVER STANDARD IS SIGNIFICANT IN THE PRO E VISION OF PROVIDING SOLAR PANELS ON THE ROOF. ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WE APPROACHED THAT FROM A STAFF PERSPECTIVE IS TRIED TO SEPARATE THOSE EVEN THOUGH POTENTIALLY THE BENEFITS COULD APPLY IN BOTH SITUATIONS. SO I JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW KIND OF HOW WE WERE APPROACHING THAT AS YOU CONSIDERED AS WELL.
02:10:08.129: >> Chair Milshteyn: AT THIS TIME, I WOULD LIKE TO OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING. IS THERE ANYONE WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION. YOU HAVE UP TO THREE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
02:10:19.841: >> THANK YOU. ETHEL POTTS, 1014 ELDER BOULEVARD. THIS IS THE SAME AREA YOU WERE JUST DISCUSSING BEFORE. IT'S ACROSS THE STREET FROM TWO BEAUTIFUL CHURCHES, IN ADDITION TO THE STATE STREET AREA THAT WE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING. IT'S A 16-STORY BUILDING WHICH IS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM WHAT IS BEING PROPOSED ON STATE STREET. THE STATE STREET OVERLAY IS RIGHT NEXT DOOR. THE OVERLAY STANDARDS ARE RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO THIS. THE PURPOSE OF THE CHARACTER OVERLAY IS TO SUPPLEMENT THE D1 AND D2 REGULATIONS TO REFLECT THE DIVERSITY OF HISTORICAL AND BUILT ENVIRONMENT IN THE DOWNTOWN. TO CONTINUE THE ZONING CODE, THIS CHARACTER OVERLAY AREAS, DISTRICTS, ACCOUNTS FOR DIFFERENCES IN EXISTING STREET PATTERNS IN THE DENSITY AND IN AMASSING THE DESIGN FEATURES. THAT'S WHAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE EMPHASIZED. THE INTENT, AS STATED IN THE ZONING CODE IS TO REFLECT THE -- THE STATED CHARACTERISTICS OF EACH CHARACTER AREA. I DON'T THINK IT HAS TO DO WITH THE PRESIDENT CHARACTER AREA. IT'S A WASHINGTON STREET PROPOSED BUILDING AND SITE PLAN. DO NOT DO THIS. AS MUCH AS ANYTHING IT HAS TO DO WITH SCALE AND MASS OF THE EXISTING DOWNTOWN WHICH IS NOT BEING REGARDED IN THIS RESPECT. THANK YOU.
02:12:23.130: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION?
02:12:38.646: >> JEFF, I SUPPORT THIS PROJECT FOR THE SAME REASONS AS I INDICATED BEFORE. I WOULD ONLY ADD THAT THE TOWER PLAZA IS A COUPLE OF BLOCKS AWAY, 25 STORIES. SO I THINK IF WE ARE TO CONSIDER DENSITY THIS IS THE APPROPRIATE SPOT TO DO THAT IN LIGHT OF THAT. SO I SUPPORT.
02:12:59.233: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU.
02:13:03.237: >> EILEEN TYLER, 126 NORTH DIVISION. I WILL BE BRIEF AS WELL. I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MAYBE DIDN'T GET MENTIONED YET IS HOW THE PEDESTRIAN EXPERIENCES ADDRESSED ALONG WASHINGTON STREET AND I THINK THAT THERE WAS A LOT OF STUDY BY THE DEVELOPER TO CONSIDER HOW MANY AND WHERE TO PUT THE ENTRANCES TO THE PARKING. AND WHAT THEY ENDED UP WITH WAS THE LEAST IMPACT ALONG THEIR FACADE DEVELOPMENT SO THAT IT WOULD MAXIMIZE THE TRANSPARENCY AND THE COMFORT FOR THE PEDESTRIAN AND WALKING BY WHAT WILL BE A VERY LARGE BUILDING. THE REST OF IT, I SUPPORT IT. THAT'S AN IMPORTANT ASPECT WHEN YOU DEAL WITH A TALL BUILDING. WE HAVEN'T FELT THAT LEVEL OF COOPERATION IN SOME OF THE OTHER DEVELOPERS ON OTHER PROJECTS DOWNTOWN, WHERE THERE'S AN APPROPRIATE LOCATION AND TREATMENT OF A PRIMARY ENTRANCE, WHERE THE SAFETY OF THE PEDESTRIANS IS PROPERLY CONSIDERED AND SEPARATED FROM THE VEHICULAR ENTRANCE AND I THINK ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE REALLY CAREFULLY ADDRESSED, INCLUDING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE THROUGH BLOCK ACCESS, AND THE TREATMENT FOR THE PEDESTRIAN IN WALKING THROUGH ALONG SOMETHING INTERESTING TO LOOK AT. SO THAT'S IMPORTANT. THANK YOU.
02:14:20.314: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU.
02:14:29.990: >> HELLO AGAIN, SCOTT TRUDEAU, WARD ONE. OVERALL, I THINK THIS PROJECT IS GREAT. I PARTICULARLY WOULD WANT -- I SUPPORT THE USE OF THE PLANNED PROJECT -- THE PLANNED PROJECT MODIFICATION FOR THIS I THINK THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT IT'S DESIGNED -- WHAT IS DESIGNED FOR IN THE ZONING ORDINANCE TO SORT OF ALLOW THE PROJECT TO BE BETTER BY HAVING SOME FLEXIBILITY IN ONE VECTOR TO MAKE OTHER THINGS POSSIBLE AND IT MAKES THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING POSSIBLE AND IT MAKES THE OPEN SPACE THAT MAKES THE PEDESTRIAN PERMEABILITY MUCH BETTER AND THEY COULD HAVE SQUEEZED MORE SQUARE FEET OUT OF THE BUILDING BY ELIMINATING AS MUCH OF THAT AS POSSIBLE TO GET MORE OF THAT F.A.R. OR LEFT THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING OUT AND I REALLY, REALLY WANT TO SEE THIS ACTUALLY HAPPEN. I'M ENTHUSIASTIC TO SEE THEY ARE PURSUING THIS PREMIUM AND TRYING TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. AND SO I SUPPORT THE USE FOR THIS. I THINK IT'S GREAT. I WILL ALSO TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY I WOULD BE HAPPY IF THERE'S NO PARKING AT ALL IN THIS BUILDING AND IT MIGHT HELP WITH SOME OF THE HEIGHT CHALLENGES. I DON'T THINK THE PARKING REQUIREMENTS FOR DOWNTOWN, ESPECIALLY THIS CLOSE TO CAMPUS ARE NECESSARY AT ALL. I WILL NOTE THEY ARE BUILDING SOME PARKING IN, PROBABLY AS MUCH AS THEY THINK THEY NEED BUT ALSO CONTRACTING OUT FOR SOME D.D.A. WHICH MEANS THEY PROBABLY DON'T THINK THEY NEED IT AND I HAVE BEEN HEARING MORE AND MORE FROM PROPERTY OWNERS DOWNTOWN THAT ARE BUILDING THIS PARKING, THAT THEY ARE NOT EVEN FILLING IT UP. I THINK THAT'S WORTH REVISITING. I THINK FOR THIS PROJECT, THEY ARE MEETING THE ORDINANCE. SO, YOU KNOW, IT'S GREAT. BUT FOR THE FUTURE, I -- I REALLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONSIDER TAKING ANOTHER LOOK OF THOSE PARKING MINIMUMS, RESIDENTIAL USE DOWNTOWN. I ALSO HAVE ONE QUESTION I HOPE MIGHT GET ADDRESSED. I NOTICED THERE'S A PUBLIC ART WALL AND IT'S RIGHT UP AGAINST THE CLASS B BICYCLE PARKING AND I'M WONDERING HOW THAT WILL WORK DEPENDING ON HOW THAT WALL IS INTENDED TO BE USED. AND I'M JUST CURIOUS. SO THANK YOU.
02:16:31.312: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU.
02:16:43.591: >> HELLO, TOM STALLBROOK AGAIN. THERE'S A LOT TO LIKE ABOUT THIS PROJECT AND A LOT THAT I LIKE ABOUT THIS PROJECT. AND I DO WANT TO SEE TALL BUILDINGS IN THIS LOCATION AND I WANT TO SEE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THIS LOCATION. WE DO HAVE AN ORDINANCE THAT SAYS D1 IS ALLOWED FOR HOW FAR AND WITH THE VARIOUS PREMIUMS, INCLUDING THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING OPTION. THEY CAN GO UP TO 900F.A.R. BUT OUR ORDINANCE DOES SAY THAT THE MAXIMUM HEIGHT IS 180 FEET. THE PETITIONER INDICATED THAT THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH IT. IF THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH THE ORDINANCE, WE SHOULD BE CHANGING THE ORDINANCE RATHER THAN USING THE VARIANCES TO FIX IT ON A ONE CASE -- I MEAN ON A CASE-BY-CASE, ONE AT A TIME BASIS. THAT'S NOT REALLY HOW ZONING IS SUPPOSED TO WORK. AND THE QUESTION IS NOT WHETHER USING A PLANNED PROJECT, WHETHER THAT -- WHETHER THEY MEET THE SPECIFICATIONS THE PLANNED PROJECT IN THE U.D.C., MY QUESTION IS WHETHER A PLANNED PROJECT IS REALLY VALID THING AT ALL. THERE'S CURRENTLY A LAWSUIT THAT CHALLENGES THAT. IT'S PART OF THE LAWSUIT THAT IS MORE COMMONLY THOUGHT ABOUT AS THE LOWER TOWN LAWSUIT. LET ME READ YOU ONE PAGE OF THAT. I'M NOT AN ATTORNEY AND I'M NOT GOING TO TRY THE CASE RIGHT HERE. BUT I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR THIS ONE PAGE FROM THE LAWSUIT. PLANNED PROJECT ORDINANCE. THE CITY'S PLANNED PROJECT ORDINANCE IS BEYOND THE AUTHORITY TO ENACT BECAUSE IT CONFLICTS WITH AND DOES NOT AUTHOR THE MICHIGAN ZONING ENABLING ACT. THE POWER TO GRANT VARIANCES UNDER THE MICHIGAN ZONING ENABLING ACT LIES WITH THE BOARD OF ZONING APPEAL AND NOT THE CITY COUNCIL. UNLESS THE CITY'S LEGISLATIVE BODY DECIDES TO SIT ALSO AS THE ZBA. IN ANN ARBOR, THE ZBA IS A BOARD SEPARATE FROM THE COUNCIL. UNDER THE MICHIGAN ZONING ENABLING ACT, THE ZBA MAY GRANT AN ORDINANCE, ONLY IF THERE ARE PRACTICAL DIFFICULTIES FOR NONUSE VARIANCES OR UNNECESSARY HARDSHIP FOR USE VARIANCES. IN THE WAY OF CARRYING OUT THE STRICT LEVEL OF ZONING ORDINANCE. THERE MAY BE A VARIANCE IN ACCORDANCE SO THE SPIRIT OF THE ZONING ORDINANCE IS OBSERVED, PUBLIC SAFETY SECURED AND SUBSTANTIAL JUSTICE DONE. THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM WITH THE PLANNED PROJECT IS THAT IT ALLOWS THE CITY COUNCIL TO GRANT VARIANCES TO DIMENSIONAL ZONING REQUIREMENTS WHICH ARE CLASSICALLY WITHIN THE SOLE PURVIEW OF THE ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS. THE ORDINANCE ALSO ALLOWS THE CITY COUNCIL TO GRANT THE PLANNED PROJECT VARIANCE FOR ANY PRACTICAL DIFFICULTY, UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES OR UNDUE HARDSHIP. THE CITY GRANTS THEM UNDER THE GUISE OF THE UNAUTHORIZED PLANNED PROJECT BASED ON THE PUNITIVE BENEFITS RATHER THAN THE STANDARDS UNDER LAW. I WOULD LIKE YOU TO REALLY THINK ABOUT THIS AS PART OF YOUR DELIBERATION. THANK YOU.
02:19:38.532: >> Chair Milshteyn: IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN THE AUDIENCE?
02:19:42.236: >> YES, JIM PIKE AGAIN. I JUST -- I WANTED TO MENTION A FEW THINGS THAT I'M EXCITED ABOUT, ABOUT THIS PROJECT. ONE, I FEEL LIKE THE THE AFFORDABILITY COMPONENT TO IT REALLY CONNECTS WITH OUR -- OUR BAD ECONOMIC SEGREGATION PROBLEM HERE IN TOWN AND I KNOW THAT THIS ONE BUILDING IS NOT A SOLUTION BY ITSELF, BUT IT'S A START. AND WE BADLY NEED TO BE HELPING DEVELOPERS TAKE SOME LEADERSHIP IN THIS IMPORTANT AREA OF LOCAL CONCERN. AS SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN CYCLING FROM HOME TO WORK EVERY DAY FOR LITERALLY DECADES NOW, I'M A BIG SUPPORTER FOR INFILL, DENSITY PROJECTS, HOUSING PROJECTS, DOWNTOWN, AS A WAY OF HELPING MORE PEOPLE LIVE CLOSER TO ALL THE JOB GROWTH THAT WE'RE SEEING DOWNTOWN AND ON CENTRAL CAMPUSA. AND LASTLY, WHEN I GO OUT OF TOWN TO THE NORTHEAST, AND I'M DRIVING HOME, INTO TOWN. , COMING IN ALONG M-14, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I ARE A LITTLE LOVE SEEING IS THE LITTLE BIT OF SKYLINE THAT PEEKS UP OUT OF THE MASSIVE TREES AND I'M REALLY EXCITED TO SEE ANOTHER TOOL BUILDING AS PART OF THAT SKYLINE. SO I HOPE YOU WILL APPROVE THIS.
02:21:09.790: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE?
02:21:24.538: >> I SPOKE PREVIOUSLY, RUSS COLLINS 2585 WEST HOLLYWOOD. I SPOKE EARLIER ABOUT MY SUPPORT FOR THIS PROJECT AND IT'S BOTH COMPONENTS. I JUST WANTED THAT TO BE CLEAR. THANK YOU.
02:21:37.684: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU. SEEING NO NOBODY ELSE, I WILL -- OH.
02:21:42.089: >> I DO WANT TO CLARIFY A COUPLE OF THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE, JUST TO GET IT OUT OF THE WAY. THE 15 S 15 SPACES THAT WE HAVE ARRANGED FOR WITH THE D.D.A. ARE OVERNIGHT ONLY SPOTS, THE PARKING LOT NEXT TO US HAS A PLETHORA OF GREAT QUANTITY AND SO THE 15 SPOTS THAT WE ARE USING TO MEET OUR PARKING REQUIREMENT COME FROM OVERNIGHT SPOTS IN THE STRUCTURE NEXT DOOR. AND WE HAVE THREE SHARED VEHICLES ON OUR PROPERTY WITHIN OUR OWN PARKING DECKS, FOR THE USE OF OUR OWN OCCUPANTS TO REDUCE THE NEED FOR HAVING INDIVIDUAL CARS, AND TO MR. TRUDEAU'S COMMENT, YES, WE DO HAVE A LOCATION PROPOSED ALONG THE MIDBLOCK CONNECTION FOR PUBLIC ART. WE ARE HOPING TO FIND A LOCAL ARTIST THAT WILL BE ABLE TO DO A MOSAIC IN THAT LOCATION BUT, YES, WE HAVE ALLOCATED A SPOT ALONG THAT MIDBLOCK CONNECTION WITH PUBLIC ART.
02:22:40.647: >> Chair Milshteyn: ALL RIGHT. AND THE MOTION STATES THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION HEREBY RECOMMENDS THAT THE MAYOR AND THE CITY COUNCIL APPROVED 616 EAST WASHINGTON PLANNED PROJECT SITE PLAN AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT WHICH ALLOWS A TALLER BUILDING WITH A VARIED FRONT SETBACK WHILE PROVIDING SOLAR AND ENERGY CONSERVING DESIGN, SUBJECT TO PROVIDING EASEMENTS FOR PRIVATE STORMWATER AND PRIVATE RECIPROCAL EGRESS AND INCREASE, AND SOLID WASTE. DO I HAVE A COMMISSIONER THAT WILL MOVE? MOVED BY COMMISSIONER SAUVE AND SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL. WE ARE IN DISCUSSION. COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL.
02:23:14.348: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: OH, I WILL GO. I DIDN'T KNOW I WAS SIGNALING. OKAY. I REALLY LIKE THE WHOLE ALLEY THING AND ALL OF THAT ACTIVATION, BUT THIS IS ALSO A BIG ASK IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH TALLER WE ARE GOING AND I FEEL LIKE TWO THINGS. I FEEL LIKE 80% AFFORDABILITY IS KIND OF LIKE MARKET RATE. IT DOESN'T REALLY ADDRESS OUR AFFORDABILITY ISSUE. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE 60% AND I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW MANY YEARS YOU ARE PROVIDING THIS FOR. THAT'S ONE THING. THE OTHER THING IS THAT I THINK THIS IS A NOD TO SOLAR AND WHAT I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE YOU DO IS ACTUALLY PUT SOLAR ON MORE OF THAT ROOF, AND TO COVER. ROOF OF THE OTHER BUILDING IN SOLAR. THAT'S WHEN YOU REALLY START TO DENT INTO WHAT WE REALLY NEED FOR OUR SUSTAINABILITY FRAMEWORK AND THAT'S THE PLANNED PROJECT IS FOR, IS TO TRULY DEMONSTRATE, BECAUSE THE CODE LANGUAGE I SEE IN THIS IS THAT YOU ARE NOT ACTUALLY GETTING CERTIFIED LEED. YOU ARE DESIGNING TO LEED, WHICH MEANS NOBODY IS REALLY CHECKING, BECAUSE CITY STAFF ISN'T. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT VISIBLE SOLAR ON BOTH OF THOSE ROOFS TO MAX IT OUT. I REALIZE THAT PEOPLE NEED TO MOVE AROUND ON THAT BUT I FEEL YOU CAN GET MORE ON THAT OTHER ROOF. I'M WILLING TO GO HIGH. I THINK IT'S A GREAT PLACE TO GO DENSE, AND IF YOU ARE GOING TO ASK FOR IT AND THIS IS WHERE THE PLANNED PROJECT PIECE COMES IN, I WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU UP THE ANTE ON THIS. THAT'S WHERE I AM.
02:24:46.239: >> COMMISSIONER SAUVE.
02:24:49.476: >> Commissioner Sauve: SO WE'RE SEEING MORE OF THESE AND PAIN POINTS IN COMMON THROUGH A LOT OF THESE HIGHER DENSITY RESIDENTIAL PROJECTS. AMAZON CAPACITY OF PACKAGES AND MAILROOMS, UBER DROPOFF AND GRUBHUB OR FOOD DELIVERIES. CAN YOU TALK ABOUT ALL THREE OF THOSE SORTS OF URBAN CONDITIONS AS THEY RELATE TO THE STREET TRAFFIC, PARKING, LOADING, NOT BLOCKING DOORWAYS WHEN TOO MANY AMAZON BOXES SHOW UP IN THE SMALL MAIL ROOM?
02:25:27.381: >> SO WE HAD INITIALLY PROPOSED BUYING TWO OF THE PARKING SPACES ALONG WASHINGTON STREET IN THIS LOCATION ON THE FAR WEST SIDE OF OUR PROPERTY FRONTAGE AND DESIGNATE THAT AS A LOADING ZONE FOR UBER PICKUPS AND DELIVERIES. THE D.D.A. SAID THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEND THE TIME BETWEEN OUR APPROVAL AND OUR CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY TO STUDY WHERE THEY FELT THE BEST LOCATION IS FOR THAT DROPOFF ZONE. SO WE ARE COMMITTED TO PAYING THE COST OF BUYING OUT THE TWO PARKING SPACES TO CREATE THE LOADING ZONE. IT'S JUST THAT THE D.D.A. WANTS TIME TO STUDY IT AND FIGHTURE FT WHERE THE BEST PLACEMENT OF IT IS. THEY MAY FEEL IT'S BETTER ON THE EAST BECAUSE IT WOULD SUPPORT MORE THAN US. SO WE ARE WORKING WITH THE D.D.A. OVER THE COURSE OF THE CONSTRUCTION TO IDENTIFY WHERE THAT WOULD HAPPEN. OUR MAILROOMS TYPICALLY WOULD HOUSE HUBS FOR THE DELIVERY OF THOSE PACKAGES WHETHER IT BE AMAZON OR OTHER DELIVERY SERVICE, U.P.S., SO THA SOMEONE WHO HAS ORDERED SOMETHING BY MAIL WOULD GET A NOTIFICATION ON THEIR PHONE THAT THERE'S A PACKAGE IN X LOCKER AND THEY WOULD GO DOWN AND SCAN THE CODE AND THE LOCKER OPENS. WE HAVE DONE THAT IN THE 611 HHIGH-RISE, MY PROJECT OVER THEE AND ALSO AT THE YARD. AND WE HAD THOSE AND THEY ARE WORKING GREAT. THEY ARE OBVIOUSLY -- SOMETIMES OF THE YEAR WHERE THERE'S MORE PACKAGED DELIVERED AND THEN THEY ARE HANDLED BY THE ON-SITE LEASING STAFF. IN THE HUB IS FULL, THAT'S WHERE THE OVERFLOW GOES.
02:27:15.088: >> Commissioner Sauve: DO WE HAVE IT THESE PLANS RIGHT NOW? I DIDN'T SEE IT NOTED FOR LOADING. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S IN THE SITE PLAN AT SOME POINT, THAT IT LANDS TO BE COMMITTED.
02:27:26.266: >> YES, I THINK THERE'S A NOTE THERE IN THAT CORNER OF THE BUILDING ABOUT WORKING WITH THE D.D.A. I HAVE TO DOUBLE CHECK.
02:27:34.141: >> WHILE BRAD IS LOOKING, I CAN POINT OUT THAT THERE'S A NOTE IN THE STAFF REPORT ON THE SECOND PAGE UNDER PARKING, THE DEVELOPER PROPOSES A LOADING AND DELIVERY AREA ON EAST WASHINGTON STREET IN FRONT OF THE PROJECT, WHICH MAY RESULT IN SOME PARKING SPACES BEING REMOVED. THE PETITIONER IS WORKING WITH THE D.D.A. AND THE LOCATION, AND COMPENSATION FOR THE LOSS OF THE SPACES.
02:27:56.763: >> Commissioner Sauve: SO IS NOT ON THE SITE PLAN BUT AT LEAST IN THE REPORT THAT WOULD COMPENSATE TO MAKE SURE IT'S COVERED.
02:28:02.602: >> YES, THERE'S A NOTE ON THE SITE PLAN POSITION. LOADING AND SERVICE AREA TO BE COORDINATED WITH D.D.A.
02:28:12.579: >> Commissioner Sauve: OKAY. THANK YOU. THAT'S IT FOR NOW.
02:28:17.517: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER ABRONS.
02:28:19.319: >> Commissioner Abrons:  YOU MENTIONED YOU HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE CHURCH TO MITIGATE THEIR CONCERNS. CAN YOU SAY MORE ABOUT THAT?
02:28:24.891: >> YES, I WILL ACTUALLY HAVE CHRIS JOHNSON WITH C.A. HE'S BEEN MEETING WITH THE CHURCH ALONG WITH MYSELF AND HOWARD FRISIE AND TALKING ABOUT WHAT THE PROJECT WILL DO TO HELP MITIGATE THE CHURCH'S CONCERNS?
02:28:41.908: >> THANK YOU. YES, OVER SEVERAL MEETINGS IN THE LAST -- SO, SIX TO EIGHT MONTHS, WE HAVE MET WITH THE CHURCH A FEW TIMES NOW. THEIR MAIN CONCERNS WERE INITIALLY THE IMPACT OF NOT AS MUCH DIRECT SUN LIGHT GOING TO THE MEMORIAL GUARDEN. THEIR SECOND CONCERN WAS WHAT ABOUT THE SOUTH FACING CLASSROOMS AND OFFICES THAT THEY HAVE. TO HELP ALLEVIATE THOSE, WE HAVE GOTTEN A PROFESSIONAL LANDSCAPE ARCHITECT TO COME AND SURVEY THE GARDEN AND PROPOSED A LIST OF CORRECTIONS, AND/OR FIXES FOR THEM. WE HAVE ALSO VOLUNTEERED THAT WE WOULD TAKE CARE OF THE MONETARY EXPENSE OF THESE FIXES AND WE WOULD CONTINUE TO FOLLOW UP OVER THE NEXT TWO TO THREE YEARS AFTER THEY ARE INITIALLY INSTALLED TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE TYPES OF FIXES TAKE. THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE EXCLUSIVELY THE MEMORIAL GARDEN BUT SOME OF THE LANDSCAPE BEDS ALONG THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE PROPERTY TO ADDRESS THEIR CONCERN WITH THE LIGHTING, THEY DO HAVE SOME CLASSROOMS AND NURSERIES AND OFFICES ON THAT SIDE. WE HAVE HIRED A LIGHTING CONSULTANT TO COME IN AND LOOK AT THE REPLACEMENT OF ALL OF THOSE FIXTURES ALONG THE SOUTHSIDE OF THE BUILDING. THERE ARE THREE FLOORS OF THESE TYPE OF USES AND THEY -- I BELIEVE THE TERM WAS ABOUT 25% OF THE POWER AT LEAST IN THOSE AREAS, SOMEWHERE AROUND 120 NEW FIXTURES WOULD BE PROVIDED.
02:30:13.433: >> THESE ARE L.E.D. FIXTURES WHICH WOULD REDUCE THE POWER CONSUMPTION.
02:30:17.971: >> Commissioner Abrons:  ONE OF THE THINGS I'M CONCERNED ABOUT IS WHAT IMPACT THE ADDITIONAL HEIGHT HAS ON THEM RECEIVING ANY DIRECT IS UP LIGHT. -- SUN LIGHT. HAVE YOU DONE A SUN STUDY?
02:30:27.847: >> WE HAVE. YES.
02:30:31.951: >> I CAN BROWSE TO THAT IN A SECOND HERE. THANK YOU.
02:30:34.888: >> Commissioner Abrons:  I CAN ASK ANOTHER QUESTION MAYBE WHILE YOU DO THAT. OH, NO. YEAH? CAN YOU MAYBE SAY A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHY YOU ARE NOT PURSUING LEEDS CERTIFICATION?
02:30:47.334: >> BRAD?
02:30:47.701: >> SO WE COMMITTED TO HAVE A THIRD-PARTY VERIFY THAT THE BUILDING IS BEING BUILT TO THE LEED STANDARDS IN THE DESIGN PACKAGE. SO IT'S NOT THAT WE ARE BE DESIGNED IT AND IT WILL BE VALUE ENGINEERED OUT. WE AGREED TO ENGAGE A THIRD PARTY DURING THE COURSE OF THE CONSTRUCTION TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S BEING BUILT AS DESIGNED. SO IT'S NOT AN ISSUE THAT, YOU KNOW, IT'S -- IT'S NOT A BAIT AND SWITCH.
02:31:15.862: >> Commissioner Abrons:  BUT WHY AREN'T YOU PURSUING THE CERTIFICATION?
02:31:19.132: >> THAT WAS AN OWNERSHIP CHOICE.
02:31:20.633: >> Commissioner Abrons:  OKAY. HMM.
02:31:23.036: >> OKAY. I THINK BACK TO THE OTHER QUESTION I DO HAVE THE GRAPHIC UP NOW. THIS WAS REGARDING THE SHADOW STUDY, I BELIEVE.
02:31:30.543: >> Commissioner Abrons: MM-HMM.
02:31:31.745: >> I'M SORRY, COULD YOU RESTATE?
02:31:34.080: >> Commissioner Abrons:  I JUST WONDERED, I GUESS, UNDERSTANDING THAT ONE OF THE CHURCH'S CONCERN IS THEHADOW THAT THIS THEY TALL TOWER WILL CAST ON THEIR SITE IF THE ADDITIONAL 25, 26 FEET OF HEIGHT THAT YOU GUYS ARE PETITIONING FOR, WHAT IMPACT THAT HAS ON -- IF ANY.
02:31:56.102: >> SO ON SCREEN RIGHT NOW IS A SHADOW STUDY PERFORMED AT EACH OF THE THREE PERIODS OF THE YEAR AND ALSO IN THE MORNING, NOON AND AFTERNOON, AND THESE ARE AT THE -- THIS IS AT THE 180-FOOT HEIGHT AND THEN WHAT WE DID IS DO IT AGAIN AT THE 208 FEET WHICH IS THE CURRENT PROPOSED HEIGHT AND THE DEMONSTRATABLE DIFFERENCES ARE VERY MINIMAL SPECIFICALLY TO THEIR LANDSCAPE AREAS THAT WERE SPOKEN ABOUT EARLIER. ADDITIONALLY, WE DID HAVE SOME METRICS THAT WE SHARED WITH THEM IN PREVIOUS MEETINGS ABOUT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THOSE TWO. THOSE AREN'T INCLUDED HERE IN THIS DOCUMENT, BUT THOSE WERE SPOKEN TO IN THE MEETINGS.
02:32:36.509: >> Commissioner Abrons:  COULD YOU GO BACK TO THE 180 FOR A MINUTE?
02:32:41.748: >> YES.
02:32:42.015: >> Commissioner Ab THANK YOU.
02:32:42.782: >> SO WHAT IT TURNED OUT IS THAT EVEN AT THE 180, WHAT YOU ARE STILL REMOVING DIRECT SUN LIGHT FROM SOUTH SIDE OF THEIR BUILDING IRRESPECTIVE, WHETHER IT'S 208 OR 180, EVEN AT 180, THEY WOULD STILL HAVE LESS LIGHT, DIRECT LIGHT COMING IN THE WINDOWS AND LET DIRECT LIGHT IN THE MEMORIAL GARDEN AND IT REALLY DIDN'T MATTER WHAT THE HEIGHT WAS, THEIR PERCEIVED IMPACTS WERE JUST THE SAME AND WE WILL MITIGATE THEM TO THEIR REQUIREMENTS.
02:33:14.848: >> Commissioner Abrons:  SURE. I THINK FOR NOW, THAT'S IT. THANK YOU.
02:33:21.454: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER BRIGGS.
02:33:26.426: >> Commissioner Briggs: I REALLY APPRECIATE HOW MUCH YOU HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE COMMUNITY TO ADDRESS SURROUNDING CONCERNS AND CLEARLY THIS PROCESS HAS BEEN GOING QUITE WELL, CONSIDERING HOW MUCH SUPPORT THERE IS FOR THIS PROJECT TONIGHT. THE ONE THING I HAVEN'T HEARD NECESSARILY DISCUSSED IS AROUND PEDESTRIAN ACCESS, THERE'S A LOT OF POSITIVES TO, THIS THE CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN LIBERTY AND WASHINGTON. BUNT IT'S PRETTY CLEAR WITH THIS AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL PEDESTRIANS IN THE AREA, THAT WE ARE GOING TO SEE MORE PEDESTRIAN ACTIVITY ACROSS WASHINGTON, AND COULD YOU DISCUSS HOW THOSE CONVERSATIONS HAVE BEEN GOING WITH THE CITY, AND I KNOW THAT THERE'S ADDITIONAL SIGNAGE PROPOSED, BUT THAT DOESN'T QUITE --
02:34:12.272: >> IN OUR COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT, WE HAD HEARD REQUESTS FOR PROVIDING ANOTHER MIDBLOCK PEDESTRIAN CROSSING. CURRENTLY, IN THAT LENGTH OF BLOCK, BETWEEN STATE AND DIVISION, THERE IS ONE MIDBLOCK PEDESTRIAN CROSSING WHICH ALIGNED WITH THE MIDBLOCK CONNECTIONS BETWEEN ANOTHER PROJECT AND MINE, THE VARSITY. SO THAT THERE'S A DESIGNATED CROSSING SPOT THIS AND THE CHURCH WOULD -- WOULD BE VERY FAVORABLY DISPOSED TO ANOTHER ONE IN ABOUT THE LOCATION OF EITHER THE WESTERN SIDE OF THE PROJECT OR THE EASTERN SIDE OF THE GARAGE. WE INITIALLY SHOWED THE MIDBLOCK PEDESTRIAN CROSSING THERE. ONE OF THE SPEAKERS SAID THAT'S PROBLEMY THERE THE LONGEST BLOCK IN THE CITY AND IN LIBERTY STREET, THE SAME LENGTH IS CONNECTED WITH TWO OTHER STREETS. WE INITIALLY PUT IN OUR PLAN PUT A MIDBLOCK PEDESTRIAN CROSSING IN THAT GENERAL LOCATION. AGAIN, THE CITY TRAFFIC AND THE D.D.A. HAD DECIDED THAT THEY WANTED TO STUDY THE BEST LOCATION FOR THAT MIDBLOCK PEDESTRIAN CROSSING. SO IT WAS REMOVED FROM OUR PLANS BUT WE ARE STILL SUPPORTIVE AND WANTING TO PUT IT IN WHENEVER THE STAFF DECIDES THE BEST LOCATION FOR IT.
02:35:29.349: >> Commissioner Briggs: THAT'S GREAT TO HEAR. HOW DOES THAT WORK IN TERMS OF WHAT'S PRECEDING WITH CITY STAFF AND D.D.A. AND THAT CONVERSATION?
02:35:37.957: >> I MAY DEFER TO BRETT ON THAT.
02:35:41.361: >> IT WOULD LIKELY BE MEMORIALIZED IN THE DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT WITH CLARIFYING WHAT THE EXPECTATION IS, IF THERE'S A FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTION WHAT THAT IS OR AT LEAST HOW IT WILL BE CALCULATED AND THEN ULTIMATELY WE WILL HAVE TO ATTACH THAT TO SOME THRESHOLD OF THE DEVELOPMENT, LIKELY BEFORE A CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY THAT WILL PROVIDE THE MOST LENGTH OF TIME FOR THOSE DECISIONS TO BE MADE AND STILL VERIFIED BEFORE THIS PROJECT WAS FINALIZED.
02:36:09.989: >> Commissioner Briggs: GREAT. THANKS. AND THEN ONE THING THAT YOU, I THINK PARTIALLY ADDRESSED MR. MOORE WAS -- IT GOT RAISED BY ONE OF THE AUDIENCE MEMBERS, MR. TRUDEAU, WAS THE BIKE PARKING ALONG THE ART WALL. COULD YOU DESCRIBE THAT A LITTLE BIT AND HOW THAT MAY CONFLICT OR NOT?
02:36:31.477: >> I THINK WE HAVE AN IMAGE OF THAT, DON'T WE? THE HOOPS WOULD BE SET OFF, FAR BIKES WOULD NOT BE UP AGAINST THE WALL THERE. WAS A PERIOD OF TIME WHEN WE CONSIDERED WALL-MOUNTED BIKE GRABBING DEVICES, BUT IN -- IN CONCERT WITH STAFF DISCUSSION, WE DECIDED TO MAKE THEM GROUND-MOUNTED HOOPS AND OBSCURE LESS. AND THE HOOPS WOULD BE SPACED OUT SO THAT THEY DON'T TOUCH THE WALL AND THEN THE LAST ISSUE IS THAT AS YOU CAN SEE, THEY ARE SHADED OR EXCUSE ME, PROTECTED BY THE WEATHER FROM THIS ELEMENT, THIS HORIZONTAL ELEMENT TO KEEP THE WEATHER OFF THE ART WORK, AND WE ANTICIPATE SOME DIRECTIONAL DOWNLIGHTING IN THAT SOFFIT TO HIGHLIGHT OUR WORK AND THEN EVEN IN THE NIGHT WHEN SOMEONE IS TRAVERSING THAT DISTRANCE, THE ART WORK WILL BE HIGHLIGHTED.
02:37:32.105: >> Commissioner Briggs: GREAT. THAT HELPS. AND I'M ALSO GLAD TO SEE THAT THERE'S DISCUSSIONS FOR REMOVING SOME OF THE ON-STREET PARKING AND PROVIDING DELIVERY SPACE THERE. I THINK THAT IS SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED WITH EVERY SINGLE PROJECT. THANK YOU.
02:37:54.393: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER SAUVE.
02:37:55.461: >> Commissioner Sauve: CAN I ASK A FOLLOW-UP QUESTION. IS THAT PAYMENT IN LIEU TO THE PUBLIC ARTS COMMISSION OR PRIVATELY COMMISSIONED?
02:38:02.568: >> WE HAVE NOT ASKED FOR A CREDIT AGAINST OUR PARKS CONTRIBUTION. SO WE WILL BE MAKING THE FULL PARKS CONTRIBUTION AND THIS WOULD BE A PRIVATE ENDEAVOR.
02:38:09.575: >> Commissioner Sauve: ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU.
02:38:16.149: >> Chair Milshteyn: SO JUST A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS. THE FIRST ONE BEING WITH REGARDS TO -- AND THIS HAS ALREADY BEEN DISCUSSED AND IT HAS TO DO WITH, YOU KNOW, UBER, LYFT, ALL THE FOOD DELIVERIES, ALL THE AMAZON DELIVERIES. TWO PARKING SPOTS ISN'T GOING TO DO IT. WE SAW WHAT A NIGHTMARE HAS BEEN ON HURON, THIS SUMMER, WHILE HURON WAS UNDER CONSTRUCTION. YOU ARE STOPPED AT ALL TIMES THERE. TWO SPOTS, FRANKLY, FOR 466 BEDROOMS AND ONE BUILDING AND MORE IN THE OTHER BUILDING IS JUST NOT GOING TO DO IT, YOU KNOW WITH THE ONE-WAY DIRECTION, PLUS, NOW HE AIRCRAFT LOT OF BIKERS WHO TAKE WASHINGTON, BECAUSE IT'S THE LESS DANGEROUS OF THE OTHER STREETS HEADING THAT DIRECTION. SO THERE'S GOT TO BE A BETTER WAY THAN HAVING JUST T SPOTS IN THE FRONT. SO HAVE YOU HAD ANY FURTHER DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THAT?
02:39:20.780: >> YES, SO FOR THE DELIVERIES THAT AREN'T BRIEFING PERIOD AND UPS DELIVERY OR SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BE TAKING LONGER, WE HAVE A STAGING AREA ON FIRST FLOOR, AS YOU -- AS YOU ENTER THE CURB CUT HERE, THERE'S A LARGE STAGING AREA HERE THAT DURING THE EARLY MORNING HOURS WOULD BE USED FOR TRASH AND RECYCLE PICKUP, BUT FOR THE REST OF THE DAYS IT'S AVAILABLE FOR OTHER TRACK AND DELIVERY PARKING. IT KEEPS IT OUT OF THE PATH OF VEHICLES ENTERING AND EXITING THE PARKING RAMPS ABOVE. SO FOR THE DELIVERIES, FEDEX, THOSE THINGS THAT ARE TAKING LONGER. THAT'S WHERE THEY WOULD STAGE IN THERE OR SOMEONE, A MOVING VAN THAT WOULD STAGE IN THAT LOCATION. SO THAT IS SUPPLEMENTAL TO WHAT THE ON-STREET LOADING ZONE, DELIVERY ZONE IS INTENDED TO BE USED FOR.
02:40:16.235: >> Chair Milshteyn: AND THE TWO SPOTS IS THAT SOMETHING YOU HAVE ASKED FOR FROM DDA OR IS THAT SOMETHING THAT THE D.D.A. HAS OFFERED? IS THERE DISCUSSION ABOUT TAKING OUT MORE THAN TWO SPOTS?
02:40:27.513: >> WE ASKED FOR MORE AND THE D.D.A. WANTS TO STUDY THE ISSUE. IT WOULD BE AN ISSUE TO NO HERB WITH THE D.D.A.
02:40:36.822: >> Chair Milshteyn: BECAUSE EVEN THREE, I DON'T THINK ARE ENOUGH IN THIS AREA. I ACTUALLY DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO WHAT WANT TO PARK THERE WITH AS MUCH TRAFFIC AS YOU WILL HAVE. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT FEDEX AND UPS BUT THE NONSTOP DELIVERIES. THAT'S MY BIGGEST CONCERN. WE ARE SEEING THIS ALL OVER THE CITY, ESPECIALLY NOW THAT WE SAW IT ON HURON, YOU KNOW, IT'S DISPLAYED WITH TWO LARGE BUILDINGS THERE. AND A CONDO BUILDING IN BETWEEN THOSE TWO BUILDINGS THAT ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO KEEP PEOPLE OUT OF THE PARKING LOT. I THINK THERE HAS TO BE MORE THAT HAS TO BE DONE WITH THAT. IT'S GOT TO BE MORE THAN TWO SPOTS IN MY OPINION. QUITE A FEW MORE THAN TWO. ALSO IN REGARDS TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND 80% A.M.I., I DO AGREE WITH COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL, 80% IS NOT ENOUGH. HOW IS THAT SET AND WHO IS -- HOW IS THAT DONE?
02:41:37.950: >> SO THE ORDINANCE ACTUALLY SPECIFIES THAT TO ACCESS THE 900% F.A.R. PREMIUM, YOU HAVE TO PROVIDE UNITS AT 80% A.M.I. SO THAT'S IN THE CODE. IF DESIRED, THAT'S WHERE THE NOTION OF PLANNED PROJECT MODIFICATIONS COMES IN, IF THERE'S INTEREST IN LOOKING AT THAT, THAT COULD BE SEEN AS POTENTIALLY ADDITIONAL BENEFIT IF IT WAS SOMEHOW LOWERED. WHEREVER THOSE UNITS ARE, THEY ARE INTENDED FOR LONG-TERM 99-YEAR PERIOD. THEY WILL BE MONITORED AS THE PETITIONER INDICATED OPEN AN ANNUAL BASIS. THEY WILL ACTUALLY FOLD INTO A WIDE MONITORING INITIATIVE THAT WE ALREADY -- THAT ALREADY OCCURS AT THE WASHTENAW COUNTY OF COMMUNITY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FOR A VARIETY OF DEVELOPMENTS SUPPORTED BY H.U.D. OR OTHER H.U.D. HOME OR C.B.D.G. AND WE WOULD WORK WITH THIS DEVELOPER TO PUT TOGETHER THE APPROPRIATE AGREEMENT THAT TRIES TO ANTICIPATE ALL OF THE POL SCENARIOS THAT -- AND EXPECTATIONS ABOUT HOW THOSE UNITS WILL BE MARKETED, TARGETED TO THE APPROPRIATE INCOME THRESHOLDS AND WHAT HAPPENS IN THOSE INCOMES CHANGE OVER TIME.
02:42:56.896: >> Chair Milshteyn: GREAT. AND THEN COMMENTS ABOUT THE BUILDING, I THINK IT'S AN ATTRACTIVE BUILDING. THANK YOU, MR.. MOORE.I LIKE THAT IT BLENDS INTE NEIGHBORHOOD. OVERALL, I DO LIKE THE DESIGN OF THE BUILDING. COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN.
02:43:12.611: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR. I APPRECIATE ALL OF THE QUESTIONS FROM THE GROUP. I AGREE IF YOU CAN GET MORE THAN TWO SPACES FROM THE D.D.A., YOU ARE GOING TO NEED THEM FOR THE LOADING ZONE. I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO REVISIT IN OUR CODE OVER ALL, ESPECIALLY JUST AS MODES OF TRANSPORTATION CHANGE AND WE NEED TO KEEP UP WITH THEM. BUT FOR THIS DOWNTOWN LOCATION, AND THE EVENTS AREA AND A DENSE BUILDING, I THINK THAT'S PRONOUNCED AND IF YOU COULD HELP TO TAKE CARE OF IT ON YOUR SITE, THAT WOULD BE APPRECIATED. I APPRECIATE THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE SHADOWS ON THE CHURCH THE CITY COUNCIL HAS BEEN GETTING SOME EMAILS ABOUT THAT EVERYTHE COURSE OF THE LAST EIGHT MONTHS -- OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST EIGHT MONTHS OR SO. SO TO SEE THE COMPARISONS IS INTERESTING. IT'S INTER INTERESTING TO SEE TE SHADOW MAPS WITH RESPECT TO SOLAR ON THE 212 PROPERTY. I THINK TO COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL'S POINT, YOU HAVE A WHOLE OTHER ROOF TO BE WORKING WITH, AND IT WOULD BE EXCITING TO SEE SOME MORE SOLAR EXPANDED TO THE OTHER BUILDING ON YOUR PROPERTY, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE WE JUST SAW THAT THERE ARE NOT ANY SHADOWS ON IT. SO IT'S -- IT'S RIPE FOR SOLAR. WITH RESPECT TO THE AFFORDABILITY, I APPRECIATE THE CONCERN. 80% A.M.I. IS STILL REAL, ESPECIALLY FOR DOWNTOWN. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT SOCIAL WORKERS. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT TEACHERS IN THEIR FIRST YEAR WORKING. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT PHYSICAL THERAPY ASSISTANTS. THE COUNTY KEEPS ACTUALLY A LOG OF WHAT ARE THE TYPE OF PROFESSIONS AT EACH OF OUR A.M.I. LEVELS AND THOSE PEOPLE IN THOSE PROFESSIONS DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO HOUSING DOWNTOWN. I THINK IT'S REAL. THAT SAID, I THINK YOU COULD DO MORE AND IF POSSIBLE, IT WOULD BE GREAT TO BRING THOSE DOWN. SO IF YOU ARE POINTING TO SOLAR AND AFFORDABILITY AS, YOU KNOW, THE PROMISE FOR A PLANNED PROJECT, THE BENEFIT FOR A PLANNED PROJECT, I THINK SEEING SOME MOVEMENT THERE WOULD BE HELPFUL. CAN WE JUST GET A SENSE OF YOUR APPETITE FOR EXPANDING SOLAR AND LOWERING THE A.M.I. THRESHOLD FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING? AND I CAN'T SPEAK FOR THEM AT ALL, BUT LIKE HALF OF CITY COUNCIL IS IN THE ROOM. SO -- [ LAUGHTER ] -- YOU KNOW, IF YOU WANTED TO WORK WITH US, YOU HAVE AN AUDIENCE.
02:45:38.691: >> YEAH, I THINK WE -- I DON'T THINK WE'RE AGAINST THE IDEA. WE HAVE  HAVEN'T STUDIED IT. WE DON'T KNOW THE IMPACT TO THE PROJECT. WE WOULD HAVE TO TAKE AT LEAST A COUPLE OFS  OF NUMBERS AND LOOKT WHAT THE ADDITIONAL VOLTAGE OR KILOWATTS WOULD BE. I DON'T THINK WE COULD ANSWER THAT TONIGHT.
02:46:02.147: >> Councilmember Ackerman: OKAY.
02:46:05.351: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL.
02:46:06.352: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: KEEP IN MIND, THIS PAYS OFF TOO. WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE OPERATING THE BUILDING, THIS DOES BENEFIT THE PEOPLE THAT LIVE THIS TOO, IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY PAY. SO I KNOW FOR YOU, IT'S LIKE A PUT OUT AT THE BEGINNING, BUT THE WHOLE IDEA OF SOLAR IS THAT, YOU KNOW, IT SAVES PEOPLE OVER TIME TOO, AND I GET IT THAT IT'S AN UP FRONT COST BUT IT STILL PAYS BACK ALSO. SO JUST KEEP THAT IN YOUR FORMULA THAT AGAIN, IT KIND OF DEPENDS IF YOU ARE OPERATING THE BUILDING OR NOT. BUT THAT IS A PIECE OF IT, ASIDE FROM THE SUSTAINABILITY PIECE THAT THAT'S PART OF THE WHOLE POINT.
02:46:43.455: >> WE ALSO HAVE TO CHECK WITH STAFF WHETHER IT WOULD NECESSITY TO GOING BACK TO HDC, BECAUSE THAT 212 BUILDING IS GOVERNED BY THE HDC. I DON'T KNOW THAT -- WHAT STAFF WOULD FEEL IS THEIR PURVIEW AS REGARDS TO THE ROOF SURFACE AREAS. I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THEY HAVE PURVIEW OR NOT.
02:47:07.680: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: I GET IT. I THINK YOU CAN DENSIFY WHAT HAVE YOU ON THAT BUILDING TOO, IN TERMS OF THE LAYOUT THAT YOU HAD. IN REGARDS TO BUILDINGS THAT I HAVE SEEN, I HAVE SEEN MUCH MORE PERCENTAGE OF SOLAR ON TOP OF THE ROOF THAT WHAT I SAW THERE. I SAW A LOT OF AREA FOR MOVEMENT AROUND THINGS. I'M NOT A SOLAR EXPERT AND I'M NOT AN ARCHITECT. I JUST WORKED ALONGSIDE THOSE PROJECTS AND I HAVE SEEN MUCH MORE SOLAR THAN THE PERCENTAGE I SAW ON YOUR BUILDING. I KNOW DIFFERENT PROJECTS ARE DIFFERENT. AND DIFFERENT CONSTRAINTS ARE DIFFERENT, BUT I STILL THINK YOU GUYS COULD UP THE ANTE ON THAT A LITTLE BIT.
02:47:42.281: >> WE DID WORK WITH THE SOLAR CONSULTANT TO DO AS MUCH AS WE COULD HERE. SO IF YOU LOOK AT THIS LAYOUT, THE PORTION OF THIS ROOF IS -- IT ACTUALLY HAS MECHANICAL SPACE IN IT AND IT'S ACTUALLY NOT THE TALL ROOF. IT'S DOWN IN THE PIT. IT'S PART OF LEVEL 19. SO THAT AREA IS REALLY, REALLY OUT OF LIMITS. WE DID SIGNIFICANT REVISIONS, ACTUALLY, TO THE UNITS ON THE UPPER FLOORS IN ELIMINATING SOME LIGHT WELL SITUATIONS ON SOME MULTISTORY UNITS, CHANGING THOSE SIGNIFICANTLY TO ACCOMMODATE AND MAX THIS OUT. SO THE REAL REASON THAT THERE'S NOTHING ON THE EDGE THERE IS THERE'S AN OSHA REQUIREMENT FOR A SETBACK FOR THE SERVICING OF THESE. ADDITIONALLY, YOU MIGHT ASK, WHY ARE THERE SO MANY ACCESS WAYS HERE? WELL, IN ORDER TO SERVICE THESE PIECES OF EQUIPMENT, THAT'S WHAT'S REQUIRED. INITIALLY UPON DRAWING IT, YES, IT WOULD HAVE INCLUDED FAR MORE THAN WE ENDED UP WITH. YOU KNOW, OUR ROOF ADDITIONALLY STEPS BACK HERE FOR THE AMENITIES AREA. WE HAVE NUMEROUS OTHER MECHANICAL VENTS AND VERTICALITIES THAT ARE PROTRUDING THROUGH THE ROOF THAT WE HAVE DONE WORK TO RELOCATE IN ORDER TO ACCOMMODATE AND MAXIMIZE THAT YELLOW AREA THAT YOU SEE THERE NOW. I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT WORK.
02:49:00.592: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: OKAY.
02:49:05.197: >> I WOULD LIKE TO SAY TO STAFF'S CREDIT, THEY DID PUSH US TO FIT AS MUCH AS WE COULD ON THE ROOF AND IT WAS SEVERAL STUDIED, INCLUDING A COMPLETE REDESIGN OF THE UNIT LAYOUT AND THE TOP FLOORS THAT DID HAVE SKYLIGHTS IN SOME OF THESE PREMIUM UNITS. SO IT TOOK ANOTHER TWO TO THREE WEEKS OF REDESIGN TO ACCOMMODATE WHAT YOU SEE ON THE ROOF PLAN NOW. I DID WANT TO STATE THAT I THINK WHAT WE CAN PROVIDE TONIGHT IN TERMS OF THE LOWER BUILDING SOLAR IS WE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE THAT EFFORT. AND WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE WHAT WE COULD FIT NOW THAT THAT'S A TIGHTER ROOF. BUT WE WOULD DO THAT STUDY. WE WOULD LIKE TO DOT AND PROVIDE THAT AS LONG AS IT WOULDN'T AFFECT OUR SCHEDULE, MEANING WE DON'T HAVE AN APPETITE FOR GOING BACK TO HISTORIC AND DOING A REDESIGN. THE OTHER OFFER THAT I THINK I COULD MAKE TONIGHT AND I THINK I HAVE THE CONFIDENCE OF MY INVESTMENT TEAM WITH ME, IS TO BRING 30% IN WHATEVER DENOMINATION OF THE ONES OR TWO BEDROOMS THAT ARE CURRENTLY AT 80% DOWN TO 60% A.M.I. SO THATS SOMETHING THAT I HAVE A HIGH LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE IN.
02:50:22.407: >> Chair Milshteyn: CAN YOU REPEAT THAT ONE MORE TIME WHAT YOU ARE WILLING TO DO.
02:50:24.877: >> THE TOTAL NUMBER OF 80% UNITS, TAKING 30% OF THOSE.
02:50:32.050: >> Chair Milshteyn: SO 19 UNITS.
02:50:34.186: >> YES, SIR.
02:50:34.853: >> Chair Milshteyn: SO CURRENTLY YOU HAVE 19 UNITS AT 80A.M.I. AND YOU ARE WILLING --
02:50:39.491: >> SO LET'S SAY SIX OF THOSE WE COULD BRING DOWN TO A 60% A.M.I.
02:50:48.700: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  SO THAT'S SIX UNITS ROUNDING UP?
02:50:56.074: >> Chair Milshteyn: SO 13 UNITS AT 80% OF THE A.M.I. AND 6 UNITS AT 60% A.M.I.
02:51:02.915: >> YES, SIR.
02:51:03.982: >> Chair Milshteyn: OKAY. THANK YOU. COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT.
02:51:07.152: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: I WAS ACTUALLY GOING TO ASK/RECOMMEND THAT YOU DO EXACTLY THAT. I MIGHT LIKE TO SEE IT SWAPPED A LITTLE BIT MORE MORENITS AT 60%, ALTHOUGH COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN, I APPRECIATE YOUR EXPLANATION, YOU KNOW, THE VARIOUS PROFESSIONS THAT MEET THAT 80% THRESHOLD THAT PROBABLY WANT TO LIVE DOWNTOWN. OF THE 19 UNITS HAVE YOU WILL THOUGHT ABOUT -- OR HOW IS IT DETERMINED THE MIX IN SIZE OF THE BEDROOM NUMBERS?
02:51:41.119: >> YES, THAT WAS IN DISCUSSIONS WITH TERESA GIOLOTTI.
02:51:45.724: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: OH, GREAT. AND THEN A COUPLE OF QUICK THINGS ON PARKING. HOW ARE THE SPACES BEING ASSIGNED? IS IT --
02:51:54.399: >> SO THE SPACES WOULD BE AN ADDITIONAL LEASE TO A TENANT.
02:51:58.070: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: OKAY.
02:51:58.937: >> THEY WOULD BE ASSIGNED AS NEEDED.
02:52:01.907: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: GOT IT. AND THE 15 SPACES THAT YOU ARE LEASING OVERNIGHT ONLY, HAVE YOU ALREADY SECURED THOSE?
02:52:08.213: >> YES, WE HAVE BEEN TO THE D.D.A. BOARD.
02:52:11.083: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: WHAT ARE THE HOURS? IS IT LIKE 6 TO 6:00 -- OR 6 TO 8:00, YOU ARE ALLOWED TO PARK THERE?
02:52:17.522: >> I WOULD HAVE TO DEFER TO THE STAFF ABOUT THE SPECIFIC HOURS. I THINK THAT'S RIGHT. I THINK IT'S SIX TO SIX, BUT I --
02:52:25.564: >> I THINK IT'S IN THAT RANGE.
02:52:29.434: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: LIKE, WHO ARE YOU ANTICIPATING WOULD USE THOSE SPACES.
02:52:32.537: >> PEOPLE THAT WOULD LIVE IN THE PROJECT BUT HAVE JOBS OUTSIDE THE CITY OR AT A REMOTE DISTANCE IN THE CITY, EITHER THE TIMING OF THEIR JOBS OR THE SCHEDULE OF THE BUS SERVICE OR OTHER FACTORS NECESSITATED OWNING A CAR AND LEAVING IN THE MORNING TO GET TO THEIR JOB.
02:52:48.053: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: GOVERN A. OKAY. THANK YOU. IHINK THAT'S IT.
02:52:58.163: >> Chair Milshteyn: FURTHER DISCUSSION? COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL.
02:53:00.599: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: ONE OTHER LITTLE THING BECAUSE GENERALLY, I'M FOR YOUR PROJECT. I DON'T WANT TO SLOW YOU DOWN EITHER, BUT I'M HAPPY TO SEE YOU MAKING SOME EFFORTS AROUND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE ARE MAKING UP. I SAW THE IMAGES FOR STAMPED CONCRETE, BUT YOUR IMAGES DIDN'T SHOW THAT. IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE IT PAVERS AND NOT STAMPED. THE STAMP TENDS TO -- YOU SEE THE JOINTS AND IT JUST LOOKED LIKE STAMPED CONCRETE. I WOULD ASK THAT YOU DO ACTUAL PAVERS LIKE YOU SHOWED IN THE RENTERRINGS. IT WOULD BE NICE -- RENDERINGS. IT WOULD BE NICE TO IF YOU BROUGHT IT UP TO WHAT YOU SHOWED IN THE LEVEL OF THE RENDERINGS IN TERMS OF THE QUALITY OF THAT.
02:53:49.781: >> Chair Milshteyn: FURTHE DO WE HAVE AN APPETITE TO TAKE THIS UP FOR A VOTE THIS EVENING? IF SO, DO I HAVE A COMMISSIONER THAT WILL MOVE AN AMENDMENT TO -- IN REGARD TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING, 13 INTEREST 50S TO BE PROVIDED AT -- UNITS TO BE PROVIDED AT 80% A.M.I. AND 6 UNITS TO BE PROVIDED AT 60% A.M.I. MOVED BY ACKERMAN AND SAUVE. ANY DISCUSSION ON THAT? ALL IN FAVOR? [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? ANY DISCUSSION ON THE AMENDED MOTION? COMMISSIONER BRIGGS?
02:54:41.633: >> Commissioner Briggs: DO WE NEED TO ADD IN ABOUT THE EXPLORATION OF SOLAR?
02:54:48.673: >> I THINK THAT WOULD COME ON THE VOTE OF THE 212.
02:54:54.246: >> Commissioner Briggs: THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THANK YOU. I THINK THIS PROJECT, AS, YOU KNOW, WE ARE SORT OF MAKING OTHER SUGGESTIONS, I THINK THE -- THE PROPOSED PROJECT PROVIDING 33% OPEN SPACE THERE ARE SOME REALLY GREAT THINGS ON THIS PROJECT AND THE COORDINATION IS REALLY GREAT, ESPECIALLY WITH THE CHURCH ACROSS THE STREET AND MICHIGAN THEATER. SO THANK YOU ON THAT.
02:55:23.275: >> Chair Milshteyn: ALL RIGHT. ANY OTHER DISCUSSION? ALL THOSE IN FAVOR, PLEASE SAY AYE. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT IS APPROVED. WE ARE QUICKLY GOING TO GO BACK TO 10-A, TO VOTE -- TO DISCUSS AND VOTE ON THAT AND THEN I PROMISE WE WILL TAKE A BREAK. [ LAUGHTER ] SO DO I HAVE A MOTION TO BRING UP THAT -- THAT ITEM OR DO I HAVE -- MOVED BY COMMISSIONER ABRONS AND SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER SAUVE. ANY OPPOSED? ALL THOSE IN FAVOR OF BRINGING IT BACK FOR DISCUSSION, PLEASE SAY AYE. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? ALL RIGHT. WE ARE BACKING ON 212 SOUTH STATE STREET, MULTIFAMILY RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT SITE PLAN FOR CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL. DISCUSSION? COMMISSIONER ABRONS.
02:56:25.403: >> Commissioner Abrons:  MAYBE CAN WE JUST GET SOME GUIDANCE FROM STAFF ABOUT WHETHER IT'S POSSIBLE TO CONSIDER SOLAR IN THE HISTORIC DISTRICT WITHOUT GOING BACK TO THE HISTORIC DISTRICT.
02:56:37.849: >> NO. [ LAUGHTER ]
02:56:39.951: >> Commissioner Abrons:  THANK YOU.
02:56:41.720: >> I WOULD -- BUT I WOULD SAY THAT THE HISTORIC DISTRICT COMMISSION HAS SOME POLICY GUIDANCE ON THE APPLICATION OF SOLAR. SO I DON'T KNOW THAT IT WOULD BE AS AN INTENSIVE PROCESS AS THE PREVIOUS, BUT THEY -- THE HDC DOES NEED TO REVIEW ALL EXTERIOR CHANGES. DOING A QUICK REVIEW, I DON'T THINK THERE WILL BE ANY HEIGHT ISSUES FOR THAT BUILDING. BUT WE -- THEY WOULD NEED TO APPROVE THE EXTERIOR CHANGE.
02:57:09.080: >> Commissioner Abrons:  AND WHAT WOULD BE THE MINIMUM TIMELINE FOR THAT, FOR THE REVIEW AND APPROVAL PROCESS?
02:57:16.288: >> APPROXIMATELY A MONTH, BUT I -- I THINK THAT THAT COULD HAPPEN CONCURRENTLY AS THIS PETITION PROGRESSES TO CITY COUNCIL. SO TO TRY AND ACCOMPLISH THAT GOAL, I GUESS THE -- THE -- THE EXPECTATION THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE CLEAR FOR YOUR COMFORT LEVEL AS TO SENDING IT WITH AN UNKNOWN OR IF THAT'S A DETERMINATION THAT YOU WANT TO HAVE THE ANSWER TO ABOUT WHAT THAT -- WHAT THAT VIABILITY IS, HAS IT BEEN APPROVED AND WHAT IS THE SCOPE OF IT ON THAT BUILDING? IF YOU ARE COMFORTABLE JUST LEAVING THAT TO STAFF TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION TO THE GREATEST EXTENT, IT SEEMS FEASIBLE AND THEN PRESENTING THAT TO CITY COUNCIL, I'M HAPPY TO DO THAT BUT I UNDERSTAND IF YOU WANT MORE CERTAINTY BASED ON YOUR DECISION.
02:58:07.272: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN.
02:58:08.206: >> Councilmember Ackerman:  I HAVE A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE, BECAUSE WHATEVER HAPPENS, I WILL HAVE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE ON IT. THE -- I WOULD SAY, I THINK WITH OUR BEST INTENTIONS, WE WOULD WANT TO MOVE THIS FORWARD, AND LET HDC MAKE THE DETERMINATION WHETHER OR NOT THEY SEE THIS AS APPROPRIATE. AND IF HDC DOES NOT THINK THAT SOLAR IS APPROPRIATE, THEN THAT'S COUNCIL'S ULTIMATE DECISION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THE PROJECT IS GOOD ENOUGH IN ITS ENTIRETY. SO, YOU KNOW, AT THAT POINT, IT'S KIND OF OUT OF OUR HANDS WHETHER OR NOT HDC DECIDES THAT SOLAR PANELS OR APPROPRIATE FOR THE DISTRICT. SO I GUESS WITH THAT, I WOULD AE MOTION -- THE MAIN MOTION TO ADD A CONDITION THAT IN THE INTERIM BETWEEN PLANNING COMMISSION AND CITY COUNCIL, THE PETITIONER AND THE CITY EXPLORE THE VIABILITY OF SOLAR ATOP THE 212 BUILDING.
02:59:11.770: >> Chair Milshteyn: DO I HAVE A SECOND? SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL. FURTHER DISCUSSION ON THE AMENDMENT? ALL THOSE IN FAVOR, PLEASE SAY AYE. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? THE AMENDMENT IS APPROVED AND WE ARE BACK TO THE MAIN -- TO THE AMENDED MOTION. ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL RIGHT. ALL THOSE IN FAVOR, PLEASE SAY AYE. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT'S APPROVED AND WE ARE GOING TO TAKE A SHORT FIVE-MINUTE BREAK. [ BREAK ]
03:08:04.301: >> Chair Milshteyn: ALL RIGHT. WE WILL GET STARTED. NEXT ITEM ON OUR AGENDA IS 10-D, AMENDMENTS TO CHAPTER 55, UNIUNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE TO D A NEW ZONING DISTRICT T1 TRANSIT SUPPORT. SO OUR PLAN FOR THIS EVENING IS TO HAVE A STAFF REPORT, AND THEN SOLICIT FEEDBACK THROUGH A PUBLIC HEARING AND GO INTO I AMOTION AND DISCUSSION AND ULTIMATELY TO TABLE THIS ITEM. TODAY IS OUR OPPORTUNITY TO SEEK FEEDBACK FROM THE COMMUNITY IN REGARDS TO THIS ITEM. SO WE WILL START WITH OUR STAFF REPORT.
03:08:38.536: >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BEFORE YOU IS A PROPOSED -- LET ME MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE CAN HEAR. BEFORE YOU IS A PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO THE U.D.C. TO CREATE A NEW ZONING DISTRICT. THERE IS NOONING PROPOSED AT THIS TIME. IT IS JUST AN ORDINANCE AMENDMENT TO PUT THIS ON THE BOOKS SO TO SPEAK. LET ME GET ATLE BIT OF BACKGROUND HERE. INCREASING DENSITY ALONG TRANSIT CORRCORRIDORS IS A TOP PRIORITY CALLED OUT IN SEVERAL OF THE MASTER PLAN ELEMENTS. AS YOU KNOW, THERE ARE MANY MASTER PLAN ELEMENTS. THE SUSTAINABILITY FRAMEWORK IS A SET OF 16 GOALS THAT ARE OVERARCHING GOALS. THEY ARE DIVIDED INTO FOUR THEME AREAS. AND THIS PROPOSAL FURTHERS MOST, IF NOT ALL THE GOALS IN THE COMMUNITY AND LAND USE AND ACCESS THEME AREAS. THE MASTER PLAN, THE LAND USE -- I'M SORRY, THE LAND USE ELEMENT OF THE MASTER INS WI COMMUNITY VISION FOR -- THAT IS IN PART A DYNAMIC COMMUNITY PROVIDING A SAFE AND HEALTHY PLACE TO LIVE, WORK AND RECREATE. IT WILL BE -- IT MEANING ANN ARBOR WILL BE A PLACE WHERE PLANNING COMMISSIONS ARE BASED IN PART ON THE INTERSECTEDNESS OF NATURAL, TRANSPORTATION AND LAND USE SYSTEMS AND IT ALSO TALKS ABOUT INTEGRATING VARIOUS LAND USES ON THE SAME SITE OR THE SAME BUILDING AND ENCOURAGES PEDESTRIAN ACT TEST AND INFRASTRUCTURE MORE EFFICIENTLY AND INCREASES VITALITY AND CAN INCREASE THE VARIETY OF HOUSING CHOICES. THAT'S ON PAGE 31. ALSO ON PAGE 31, HERE'S AN EXCERPT SCREEN SHOT OF THE PLAN. IT PROVIDES SPECIFIC DESIGN PRINCIPLES THAT SHOULD BE INCORPORATED INTO COMMERCIAL CENTERS, BUT AS YOU KNOW, THIS IS IN THE MASTER PLAN. THIS DOESN'T CARRY THE WEIGHT OF ORDINANCE AND WHAT WE ARE DOING IS PROPOSING AN ORDINANCE. AGAIN, THE LAND USE ELEMENT AND THE LAND USE GOALS, OBJECTIVES AND ACTION STATEMENTS, THREE OF THEM SPEAK TO A NEW ZONING DISTRICT FOR SUPPORTING A MIX OF LAND USES AND DENSITY NEEDED FOR PREMIER TRANSIT SERVICE. GOAL B IS TO PROMOTE LAND USE DESIGN THAT REDUCE THE RELIANCE ON THE AUTOMOBILE AND GOAL C IS TO PROVIDE A FULL RANGE OF HOUSING CHOICES. AND IT MEETS THE EXISTING AND ANTICIPATED NEEDS OF ALL CITY RESIDENTS. GOAL E. IS TO ENCOURAGE EMPLOYMENT AND SECURITY CENTERS THAT PROVIDE A SENSE OF BALANCE WITH THE SURROUNDING LAND USES. IN THE PLANNING COMMISSION'S WORK PROGRAM LISTED IN THE HIGHEST PRIORITY WORK, NUMBER ONE, DEVELOP REGULATORY INCENTIVES THAT ENCOURAGE REDUCTIONS OF IMPERVIOUS SURFACES BUT ALSO FOUR, DEVELOP REGULATORY INCENTIVES, REVISE THE CODE TO REDUCE MINIMUM AND ESTABLISH MAXIMUM SETBACK REQUIREMENTS IN APPROPRIATE ZONING DISTRICTS TO HELP SHORTEN DRIVEWAYS AND SIDEWALKS. ANOTHER ELEMENT OF THE MASTER PLAN IS THE TRANSPORTATION PLAN. IT IS A GUIDE FOR IMPROVEMENTS TO THE CITY'S SYSTEM OF ROADS, SIDEWALKS, PATHS AND BIKE LANES AND PUBLIC TRANSIT FOR THE NEXT 20 YEARS. ITS VISION -- IT HAS A VISION OF AN INTEGRATED MULTIMODAL SYSTEM THAT WILL BUILD UPON EACH PART OF THE CITY. IT PROMOTES TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM SUPPORTIVE OF AND INTEGRATED WITH LAND USE DECISIONS, AND IT HAS A PHILOSOPHY TO IMPROVE THE SAFETY, REDUCE EMISSIONS AND REDUCE CONGESTION BY NOT WIDENING STREETS THROU ABOUT YOU A SERIES OF TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENTS AND POLICY CHANGES. AND IT'S RECOMMENDATIONS FOR LAND USE, AND LET ME CALL YOUR ATTENTION, I THINK, TO THE FIRST SECOND, AND FIFTH BULLET. UPDATE THE LAND USE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE MASTER PLAN TO SUPPORT INCREASED DENSITY AND MIXED LAND USES AND SIGNATURE TRANSIT CORRIDORS, CREATE TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT OVERLAY DISTRICTS FOR SIGNATURE CORRIDORS AND THE FIFTH BULLET, INCORPORATE INTO THE ZONING ORDINANCE FORM-BASED REGULATIONS THAT SUPPORT TRANSIT AND ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION. THE -- ANOTHER ELEMENT OF THE MASTER PLAN OF THE NON-MOTORIZED TRANSPORTATION PLAN, IT IS INTENDED TO HELP ANN ARBOR ONCE AGAIN BECOME A NATIONAL LEADER IN QUALITY -- HIGH QUALITY NON-MOTORIZED TRANSPORTATION AND CONTRIBUTE TO KEEPING ANN ARBOR ONE OF THE BEST PLACES TO LIVE AND WORK IN THE COUNTRY AND HAS GOALS TO INCORPORATE NON-MOTORIZED BEST PRACTICES INTO ALL RELEVANT PRACTICES AND ALL ASPECTS AND STAGES OF PLANNING AVAILABLE TO THE CITY AND ITS PARTNER ORGIONS. THESE ARE SCREEN SHOTS OF THE NON-MOTORIZED TRANSPORTATION PLAN UPDATE. THE CIRCLE ON THE LEFT, AND FIRST OFF, IT -- THESE PAGES TALK ABOUT APPROACHES TO SUPPORT VIABLE TRANSIT, ESPECIALLY ALONG SIGNATURE CORRIDORS. ENCOURAGES T.O.D. OR TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT. FIRST BULLET POINT THAT'S CIRCLED OPEN THE LEFT SAYS USE ZONING TO RESTRICT ADDITIONA DEVELOPMENT OF AUTO RELATED DESIGNS SUCH AS GAS STATIONS, OFFICE BUILDINGS INSTEAD THE ZONING SHOULD ENCOURAGE MORE COMPACT DEVELOPMENT WITH BUILDINGS CLOSER TO THE STREET TO INCREASE TRAVELER CHOICES TO MAKE IT MORE CONVENIENT FOR WALKERS AND BIKERS. AND THE PAGE ON THE RIGHT PROMOTES ABOUT RESIDENTIAL AND EMPLOYMENT DENSITY THAT SUPPORTS TRANSIT DENSITY COULD MEAN MINIMUM HEIGHTS RATHER THAN MAXIMUM HEIGHTS AND MIXED USE AND TALKED ABOUT DECREASED REQUIRED PARKING NEEDS AS TRANSIT NEEDS INCREASES AND USING ZONING REVISIONS THROUGH CORRIDORRED OVERLAY DISTRICT OR MORE FORM BASED RATHER THAN USE-BASED APPROACH. THIS NON-MOTORIZED PLAN RECOGNIZES THE BENEFITS OF MIXED USE AND PROVIDES A VERY NICE GRAPHIC ON PAGE 91, AND ITS CAPTION IS WHILE TYING COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENTS TO SURROUNDING RESIDENTIAL AREAS IS A GOOD PRACTICE, A BETTER PRACTICE IS TO ELIMINATE THE SEGREGATION OF COMMERCIAL PANE HOUSING AREAS. -- COMMERCIAL AND HOUSING AREAS. SO TO THAT END, WE ARE PROPOSING A NEW ZONING -- A NEW ZONING DISTRICT IN THE ORDINANCE. THE ZONING ORDINANCE AND THE LAND USE REGULATIONS ARE -- THE U.D.C. AND THE ZONING ARE OUR PRIMARY TOOL TO AFFECT AND ADDRESS LAND USE. WHEN LOOKING AT THE ZONING DISTRICTS THAT WE HAVE NOW, NO EXISTING DISTRICT REQUIRES BOTH RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL. SO A NEW ZONING DISTRICT THAT IS COMBINED AND BUILDS UPON THE BEST DEVELOPMENTS OF THE DOWNTOWN AND THE COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENTS THAT WE HAVE IS PROPOSED. THE T1 DISTRICT THAT I WILL SPEAK MORE ABOUT PERMITS USES LIKE THE D2 AND THE C3 DISTRICT. DISTRICT, FORMS THE OUTSIDE OF THE DOWNTOWN DISTRICT. C3 IS OUR FRINGE COMMERCIAL OR OUR BIG BOX STYLE ZONING DISTRICT. IT HAS PLACEMENT STANDARDS LIKE THE OFFICE DISTRICT. IT HAS FORM-BASED STANDARDS LIKE THE D1 AND D2 AND THE NINE CHARACTER OVERLAY DISTRICTS DOWNTOWN. BUT IT ALSO HAS USE SPECIFIC STANDARDS WHICH ARE NEW FOR US TO ATTAIN THE AMENITIES AND FEATURES NEEDED TO SUPPORT TRANSIT, EXPAND HOUSING CHOICES AND MEET THE GOALS OF THE MASTER PLAN. SO I WILL GO THROUGH THE ACTUAL PROPOSED LANGUAGE AT A LITTLE BIT OF A HIGHER LEVEL AND I'M HAPPY TO ENTERTAIN ANY FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS. WE ARE PROPOSING AN INTENT STATEMENT. IT TALKS ABOUT WHAT OUR GOAL IS FOR THIS, WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH WITH IT AND WE ARE ALLOWING AND REQUIRING A MIX OF USES IN SUFFICIENT DENSITY TO SUPPORT EXISTING AND FUTURE TRANSIT SYSTEMS. THE PERMITTED USE TABLE WILL BE AMENDED. THERE WILL BE A COLUMN ADDED FOR T1. THE USES PROPOSED ARE GENERALLY THE SAME AS D2 AND C3, BUT THE AUTO-ORIENTED USES HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED. SO THAT BOX IS BLANK. OUR USE TABLE IS SET UP THAT A P IS PERMITTED, E IS A SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE AND IF IT'S BLANK, IT IS NOT PERMITTED. SO EXAMPLE, WE PULLED OUT AUTOMOBILE SALES, FUELING STATIONS, WHOLESALE AND CONTRACTOR SALES, AUTO REPAIR, WAREHOUSE AND STORAGE AND THE DRIVE THRU, AS AN ACCESSORY USE IS NOT PERMITTED IN THE T1. THE USE-SPECIFIC STANDARDS, THIS WOULD BE -- IT WOULD FIT INTO THE USE SPECIFIC STANDARDS AN Q. NUMBER ONE IS A MIXED USE REQUIREMENT. HALF OF THE FLOOR AREA, NO MORE THAN 66% MUST BE HOUSEHOLD LIVING. SO THAT MEANS THAT WE COULD HAVE A 50/50 MIX RESIDENTIAL AND NONRESIDENTIAL. WE COULD ALSO HAVE A TWO-THIRDSS RESIDENTIAL AND A ONE-THIRD COMMERCIAL. BUT THAT'S SORT OF THE RANGE THAT WE ARE SHOOTING FOR. FOR BUILDING DESIGN, THE -- WE HAVE GOT -- WE TALK ABOUT HOW WE NEED A SECOND STORY AND HOW ADDRESSES HOW THE SECOND STORY HAS TO GO. THIS IS MOSTLY PULLED FROM THE D2. D1 AND D2, WE ALREADY HAVE THESE REGULATIONS AND WE ARE REPEATING THEM HERE FOR THE T1. WE ARE INTRODUCING TRANSPARENCY REQUIREMENTS. WE ALREADY HAVE THESE IN THE DOWNTOWN. THESE ARE LIGHTLY DIFFERENT, BUT WE HAVE ALREADY BEEN WORKING WITH THIS CONCEPT WITH 16% OF THE FIRST FLOOR FACADE BETWEEN THE 2 AND THE 9 FEET MUST BE CLEAR WINDOWS AND DOORS. AND TALKS ABOUT HOW HIGH THE WINDOWS CAN BE. REGULATIONS REGARDING DOORS AND ENTRANCES, YOU HAVE TO HAVE A FUNCTIONAL ENTRANCE FACING A STREET AND PROVIDES A LITTLE BIT MORE GUIDANCE TO HELP YOU APPLY IT. FOR SITE DESIGN, THE DEVELOPMENT SHALL, ARRANGED TO ACCOMMODATE ALL MODES OF TRANSPORTATION, INCLUDING PEDESTRIAN, BICYCLES, PERSONAL VEHICLES, RIDE SHARING AND PUBLIC TRANSIT. AMENITIES MUST BE PROVIDED TO FACILITATE ACCESS TO AND THE NON-MOTORIZED TRANSPORTATION MODES. EXAMPLES ARE OTHER AMENITIES MAY BE APPROPRIATE DEPENDING ON SIZE AND LOCATION OF THE SITE AND BEST PRACTICES MUST BE USED WHEN DESIGNING AND APPROVING THESE PROJECTS. WE SPECIFY THAT THE CONVENIENCE AND THE SAFETY OF PEDESTRIAN AND NON-MOTORIZED TRANSPORTATION MUST BE PRIORITIZED OVER MOTORIZED TRANSPORTATION. SO WE ARE NOT PROHIBITING MOTORIZED TRANSPORTATION OR EVEN PERSONAL VEHICLES BUT WE ARE IDENTIFYING, WHAT IS THE HIERARCHY AND WHO GETS THE RIGHT-OF-WAY. WHAT WE DO NOT ADDRESS NOW IS MAYBE COMING BUT WE DO NOT ADDRESS NOW, BUT ADEQUATE AND CONVENIENT SPACE SHALL BE PROVIDED FOR RIDE SHARING SERVICES AND OTHER FORMS OF SHARED TRANSPORTATION. AND, AGAIN, MOTE ORIZED TRANSPORTATION AND SPACES FOR VEHICLES, PARKING SPACES MUST YIELD TO ALL OTHER FORMS OF TRANSPORTATION. SO THE NUMBER OF DRIVEWAYS, THE WIDTH AND THE NUMBER OF PARKING SPACES MUST BE REDUCED TO SATISFY THE SITE DESIGN FEATURES AND THE PRIORITIES SPECIFIED ABOVE. FOR OFF STREET PARKING FOR THE DWELLING UNIT -- ANY DWELLING UNITS IN THE DEVELOPMENT, MINIMUM OF NONE AND A MAXIMUM OF HALF HEY SPACE PER UNIT MAY BE PROVIDED BICYCLE IS AS REQUIRED IN CODE FOR WHATEVER USE YOU ARE PROPOSING. AND THE NONRESIDENTIAL FLOOR AREA A MINIMUM OF NONE AND THE MAXIMUM AS PROVIDED IN THE PARKING REQUIREMENT. SO WE ARE STILL ALLOWING PARKING BUT WE ARE NOT -- WE ARE NOT DRIVING THE PARKING NEEDS. THE PARKING FEEDS WILL BE DRIVEN MORE BY THE MARK. IN THE DIMENSIONAL STANDARDS TABLE, AS A SIDE, I PROPOSE A LITTLE BIT OF A SIMPLER FORMAT BUT THE NUMBERS ARE ALL THE SAME BUT IF YOU COMPARE THIS PROPOSED TABLE TO THE U.D.C., YOU WILL NOTICE THAT IT LOOKS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT. TEN ACIN THE PROPOSED ORDINANCE, IT HAS THE ENTIRE TABLE HERE FOR THE PRESENTATION, I HAVE ONLY PULLED OUT THE T1 DISTRICT, AND THEN FOR COMPARISON, THE OFFICE C3 AND D2. THE T1 DISTRICT, THE FLOOR AREA SAYS SEE SECTION -- SEE THE USE-SPECIFIC AREAS. YOU WILL SEE THAT HALF OF YOUR FLOOR AREA NEEDS TO BE RESIDENTIAL AND SO FORTH. AND THERE'S NO LIMIT. THE DEVELOPMENT WILL BE GUIDED MORE BY THE SETBACKS -- THE SETBACKS, HEIGHT, AND THE PROGRAMMING OF THE SITE. THERE IS AN OPEN SPACE REQUIREMENT, 25% FRONT SETBACK MAXIMUM. SIDE AND REAR SETBACKS MATCH THE OFFICE DISTRICT. WHEN YOU ARE -- THE SETBACK IS 30 FEET. IF YOU ARE A PARCEL THAT IS NOT NEAR A RESIDENTIAL ZONING DISTRICT, YOU HAVE NO SIDE OR REAR SETBACK. THE HEIGHT REQUIREMENT IS A COMBINATION OF THE D2 MINIMUM 2. THE MAXIMUM IS SIMILAR TO C3, AND THE OFFICE DISTRICT IN THAT WHEN YOU ARE WITHIN 300 FEET OF RESIDENTIAL, THERE'S A HEIGHT LIMIT AND WHEN YOU ARE OUTSIDE OF THAT, THERE'S NO HEIGHT LIMIT. THERE IS NO MINIMUM SIZE FOR THE LOT DIMENSION OR THE LOT WIDTH. NOW, IN TERMS OF WHERE THIS GOES, I HAD SAID THAT WE ARE NOT PROPOSING A REZONING, BUT WE DID THINK ABOUT AND TALK ABOUT YOU HAVE TO ENVISION WHERE THIS MIGHT GO SO THAT YOU CAN CRAFT THE PROPER STANDARDS. OUR TRANSIT CORRIDORS IN THE CITY ARE LISTED. THE FIRST THREE ARE THE ONES THAT WE WERE ENVISIONING FOR THIS T1 AND WE ADDED THE 1 BECAUSE AS LIKE OUR OTHER DISTRICTS, MAYBE THEY ARE IN -- IN THE FUTURE, THERE SHOULD BE A T2 AND A T3 BUT WHAT WE WERE THINKING ABOUT FOR NOW, WAS WASHTENAW, SOUTH STATE AND EAST AND WEST EISENHOWER BOULEVARD. AND JUST TO HELP YOU VISUALIZE WHAT THIS MIGHT BE. SO AGAIN, REZONING IS NOT PROPOSED, BUT WHEN WE HAD SOMETHING -- AN IMAGE IN MIND, THE SOUTH STATE AND WEST EISENHOWER TARGET AREA. SO WE WERE TALKING ABOUT SOUTH STATE OVER THROUGH AND PAST SOUTH MAIN, RIGHT NOW THIS AREA IN RED, IT'S ALL -- NONE OF IT IS RESIDENTIAL RIGHT NOW. IT'S ALL EITHER OFFICE OR A PUD, A COMMERCIAL PUD NOW. AND THEN THE BLACK DASHED LINE WOULD BE THE AREA SORT OF WHERE THAT UNLIMITED HEIGHT, THE AREA THAT IS THINGS THAT ARE MORE THAN 300 FEET FROM RESIDENTIAL AREAS. SO -- AND THEN ON THE -- THE OTHER SIDE THE INTERSECTION, SOUTH STATE AND THE EAST EISENHOWER TARGET AREA, EAST EISENHOWER OVER TO THE RAILROAD TRACK, UP TO OAK BROOK AND DOWN TO VICTOR'S WAY, BUT THAT'S THE AREA THAT WE WERE SORT OF ENVISIONING. THIS AREA DOES NOT ABUT RESIDENTIAL AT ALL. AND THEN FINALLY, WASHTENAW. THE COMMERCIAL AREA OF WASHTENAW EXISTING COMMERCIAL AREA IS OUTLINED IN RED. IF THAT WERE TO BE REZONED TO T1 EXACTLY AS THOSE BOUNDARIES ARE, THERE'S A SMALL -- THERE'S A SMALL AREA IN THE ARBORLAND AREA THAT WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR UNLIMITED HEIGHT AND THE ARBOR CROSSINGS, BUT THERE'S ANOTHER AREA ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF WASHTENAW BETWEEN PLATTE AND HURON PARKWAY THAT COULD HAVE UNLIMITED HEIGHT. JUST TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF THE SCALE OF THESE AREAS AND -- AND HOW DIFFERENT IT WOULD BE FROM CURRENT ZONING AND SO FORTH. SO AGAIN, THAT WAS OUR PROPOSED -- THIS IS OUR PROPOSAL TO MEET OUR -- TO IMPLEMENT AND TO MEET OUR GOALS OF THE MASTER PLAN. BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS.
03:25:21.371: >> Chair Milshteyn: MR. LENART.
03:25:22.038: >> I WANT TO TAG ON, THIS HAS BEEN ON THE PLANNING COMMISSION WORK PLAN FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS. IT'S SLOWLY STARTED ELEVATING IN PRIORITIES AS I HAVE FAILED TO DELIVER IT TO YOU. AND JUST FOR A SENSE OF SCALE, WE TALK ABOUT THE 300 FEET AS IT'S REFERENCED -- THE 300 FEET AS A SEPARATION BARRIER, FOR SCALE THAT IS ABOUT THE DISTANCE THE CURB LINE OF ANN STREET TO HURON STREET ON THIS CITY BLOCK. SO THAT'S ROUGHLY ABOUT 300 FEET.
03:25:58.775: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU. AT THIS TIME, I WOULD LIKE TO OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING. ANY MEMBERS IN THE AUDIENCE MAY ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION FOR UP TO THREE MINUTES. PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS FOR THE RECORD.
03:26:14.991: >> I'M JEFF CROCKETT, 506 EAST KINGSLEY AND I'M THE COMMUNICATION FORCE OF THE 4th . I WOULD LIKE TO THANK BRETT AND HIS STAFF FOR RESPONDING TO NUMEROUS ISSUES THAT WE HAD IN THE HOLD 4th WARD AND WE APPRECIATE THAT SERVICE, BUT WHAT I'M SPEAKING ON TONIGHT IS SOMETHING A LITTLE DIFFERENT. AND THAT'S ABOUT THE T1 ZONING PROPOSE A. I SENT AN EMAIL -- PROPOSAL. I SENT AN EMAIL THAT LISTS SIX DIFFERENT CONCERNS BUT I'M NOT GOING TO SPEAK ABOUT ALL SIX OF THOSE CONCERNS TONIGHT. I HAVE WOULD LIKE TO FOCUS ON THE LACK OF THE COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND INPUT AND INADEQUATE TIME FOR THE COMMUNITY TO REVIEW THE STAFF REPORT. IT SEEMS FROM WHAT I GATHERED FROM MR. LENART. THERE ARE TWO PUBLICATIONS, PUBLICATIONS IN THE WASHTENAW LEGAL NEWS AND LETTERS TO ORGANIZATIONS. SO I DON'T KNOW IF ANY OF YOU HAVE ACTUALLY TRIED TO LOCATE THE MEETING NOTIFICATION IN THE WASHTENAW LEGAL NEWS, BUT I TRIED AND I COULDN'T FIND IT AT ALL. NOW, AS IT TURNS OUT, THE PROBLEM I THINK IS THAT THE ANNOUNCEMENTS ARE IN THE FORM OF ADS AND THE ADS AREN'T SEARCHABLE. SO YOU REALLY CAN'T GO INTO THE WASHTENAW LEGAL NEWS AND FIND INFORMATION ABOUT INFORMATION FROM THE PLANNING. THE OTHER THING IS, I NOTICED MR. STANTON WROTE AN ARTICLE VERY INFORMATIVE ARTICLE ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL, BUT IT JUST APPEARED SORT OF LIKE YESTERDAY. AND SO I'M WONDERING WHY CAN'T, FOR EXAMPLE, YOU GUYS WORK WITH RYE ARYAN TO DO SOMETHING LIKE , AN ARTICLE TWO WEEKS IN ADVANCE. WITH REGARD TO NEIGHBORHOOD ORGANIZATIONS. IT'S COME TO MY ATTENTION THAT IN 2018, THE CITY COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, SURVEYED THE 95 CONTACTS ON FILE, CONFIRMED THAT ONLY 45% OF THE ORGANIZATIONS WERE STILL ACTIVE. SO THE OBVIOUS QUESTION IS, WHY ARE WE SENDING OUT 95 NOTIFICATIONS IF WE HAVE ONLY VERIFIED THAT 45 STILL EXIST? AND IT SEEMS NO ME THAT WE ARE ANN ARBOR. -- TO ME THAT WE ARE ANN ARBOR AND WE CAN DO A LOT BETTER THAN THAT. THE SOLUTION IS NOT THAT DIFFICULT. JUST TO IMPLEMENT THE NEIGHBORHOONEIGHBORHOOD WATCH PO CREATE NEIGHBORHOOD VOLUNTEER -- OR CONTACTS BUT MEET WITH THE NEIGHBORHOOD CONTACTS. AND SO WE SAID INDICATE THEM, BASICALLY MORE ON WHAT THE PLANNING PROCESS IS ALL ABOUT. AND WHAT TO DO IF THERE ARE ISSUES OR COMPLAINTS, BECAUSE PART OF THE PROBLEM FROM MY VIEW POINT IS SORT OF UNDERSTANDING THE COMPLEXITY OF ZONINGEN ATHE AVERAGE NEIGHBORHOOD PERSON DOESN'T DO THAT. WE HAVE TO DO A BETTER JOB OF EDUCATING. IN REGARDS TO THE INADEQUATE TIME FOR PUBLIC REVIEW, REMEMBER, I'M AN ORGANIZATION. I DID RECEIVE NOTICE OF THIS A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO. THE PROBLEM IS I WOULDN'T HAVE ACCESSION TO THE ORDINANCE OR THE STAFF REPORT UNTIL LAST FRIDAY, WHICH IS ONLY FOUR DAYS BEFORE THE TIME THAT YOU WERE MEETING. NOW, AN ORGANIZATION, I CAN'T SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE ORGANIZATION, BUT THANK YOU VERY I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. BOY, TIME FLIES WHEN YOU ARE HAVING FUN.
03:29:27.016: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU.
03:29:34.157: >> ME AGAIN, ABOUT NEIGHBORHOOD ORGANIZATIONS. A FEW YEARS BACK, SEVERAL OF US TRIED GOING THROUGH THE LIST, THE OFFICIAL LIST HERE IN CITY HALL. WE DISCOVERED A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF THE ORGANIZATIONS DO NOT EXIST OR THE CONTACT PERSON FOFOR THE ORGANIZATION IS NO LONGER THE CONTACT PERSON OR HAS EVEN DIED IN SOME CASES. AND -- AND IF THEY HAVE A NEW CONTACT PERSON, YOU WILL NEVER KNOW ABOUT IT BECAUSE THERE'S NO WAY THAT YOU CAN FIND OUT. SO I THINK WE NEED -- I THINK THAT LIST -- DOES IT CONSIST OF EVEN 45%? I DON'T KNOW. BUT ■I WOULD SAY ABOUT 20% OF THAT LIST IS WORTH WHILE. SO FIND ANOTHER WAY.
03:30:23.106: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU.
03:30:30.013: >> I'M JOAN LOWENSTEIN, I LIVE AT 502 BURSON PLACE AND I'M HERE REPRESENTING THE BOARD OF THE WASHTENAW HOUSING ALLIANCE. SO WE ARE VIGILANT ABOUT ORDINANCES THAT AFFECT AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND, YES, WE DID HAVE PLENTY OF NOTICE OF THIS, AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE TO SPEAK. I THINK WE HAVE TWO CRISES, PRIMARY CRISES THAT ARE GOING ON THAT AFFECT LOCAL GOVERNMENT. FIRST IS CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE OTHER IS AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND I THINK THAT THIS -- I WANT TO COMMEND THE STAFF FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD NOW BECAUSE I THINK THERE ARE POTENTIALS WITHIN AN ORDINANCE CHANGE LIKE THIS TO ADDRESS BOTH OF THOSE THINGS. FIRST OF ALL, WITH CLIMATE CHANGE, AS WE KNOW AIG PART OF THAT IS TRANSPORTATION, TRANSIT, CARS. IF WE CAN REDUCE THE NEED TO USE AUTOMOBILES AND I'M SORRY, DOUG KILBAUGH IS NOT HERE ANY MORE. HE WROTE A WHOLE BOOK ABOUT CITIES AND CLIMATE CHANGE. IF WE CAN REDUCE THE NEED TO USE CARS, THAT WILL GO A LONG WAY TOWARDS HELPING US WITH CLIMATE CHANGE. YOU KNOW, IT SEEMS LIKE AN IMPOSSIBILITY, BUT PEOPLE DO EVOLVE, AND SO PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO LEARN ABOUT NOT GOING EVERYWHERE IN CARS AND NOT HAVING ONE PERSON PER CAR GO EVERYWHERE. JUST TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE THAT WAS KIND OF ALLUDED TO BEFORE IN THE PREVIOUS DISCUSSIONS, WITH -- I ALSO SIT ON THE D.D.A., AND THESE DEVELOPERS ARE COMING TO US AND ASKING FOR PARKING. WELL, ONE OF THE DEVELOPERS FOR ONE OF THE STUDENT HIGH RISES ON SOUTH U CAME TO ASK FOR PARKING. SHE SAID, WE ARE ASKING FOR THIS BECAUSE WE ARE FORCED INTO IT, BUT WE FIND IN RENTING IN -- RENTING THESE APARTMENTS FOR STUDENTS, NOBODY IS BUYING THE PARKING. SO THEY HAVE TO BUY FOR ONE OF THESE BIG BUILDINGS SOMETHING LIKE 27 PARKING PLACES FROM THE D.D.A., BUT NOBODY IS BUYING THEM. SO EVEN STUDENTS ARE EVOLVING AND FIGURING OUT THEY DON'T NEED TO BRING A CAR TO CAMPUS. MORE IMPORTANTLY THE AFFORDABLE ISSUE, I THINK THE T1 DISTRICT HAS A GREAT POM TO INCREASE THE AFFORDABILITY, NOT THE LEAST OF WHICH IS MAKING IT SO THAT SOMEONE DOESN'T HAVE TO HAVE A CAR. BECAUSE THAT'S A HUGE PART OF WHETHER SOMEONE CAN AFFORD TO LIVE IN A PLACE. I ENCOURAGE YOU TO THINK ABOUT AFFORDABILITY AS YOU DISCUSS THIS. AND I'M REALLY EXCITED TO SEE WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO DO WITH IT. THANKS.
03:33:17.280: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU.
03:33:30.827: >> HELLO, TOM STALLWORK AGAIN IF. AFFORDABLE, IF YOU WANT IT, IT SHOULD BE IN THE ORDINANCE. WE SAID WE WILL CREATE OPPORTUNITY FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. LET'S PUT PREMIUMS IN THIS. I THINK THE T1 IS A GREAT IDEA. I LIKE THE IDEA OF TRANSIT CORRIDORS AND HAVING MIXED USE DEVELOPMENTS. I THINK IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE BUT WE HAVE TO MANDATE, IT OTHERWISE WE ARE NOT GOING TO GET IT. THERE'S NO REASON THAT WE SHOULD BE GIVING EVERYTHING AWAY IN TERMS OF EXTRA HEIGHT, REDUCED THIS OR THAT, WHATEVER, WITHOUT ASKING FOR SOMETHING IN RETURN, WHICH IS WHAT WE DO WITH OUR PREMIUMS IN THE DOWNTOWN AREA. CITY COUNCIL IS GOING GOING TO E LOOKING AT THE REVISED PREMIUM ORDINANCE AT THEIR NEXT MEETING. YOU PASSED THAT ON TO THEM, AND THEY ARE GOING TO BE VOTING ON IT. WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT PREMIUMS AS PART OF THE MIX FOR THE T1 DISTRICT AS WELL. IN TERMS OF PARKING, WHAT WE FOUND WITH PARKING, IT'S VERY DIFFERENT IN DIFFERENT PLACES. IN THE DOWNTOWN, THERE'S A DEFINITE DIFFERENT NEED FOR PARKING AND LACK OF NEED. STUDENT LIVING DIFFERENT NEED FOR PARKING THAN IN OTHER AREAS. AND THE TRANSIT CORRIDORS, I THINK WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT PARKING A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY, BECAUSE THE USERS WILL BE THINKING ABOUT IT A LOT DIFFERENTLY. THERE ARE SITUATIONS ESSENTIALLY IF YOU DON'T HAVE SUFFICIENT PARKING, IN CERTAIN AREAS, WHAT YOU DO IS YOU JUST MOVE THE PARKING BURDEN FROM THE NEW DEVELOPMENT TO THE SURROUNDING NEIGHBORHOODS. SO THE NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS WILL THEN BE PARKED FULL OF ALL THE CARS THAT DON'T HAVE THE PARKING PROVIDED, AND PART OF THE ISSUE IS, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU HAVE CERTAIN PLACES WHERE YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR PARKING, IT'S -- YES, IT'S A DISINCENTIVE BUT IF WE ARE ALLOWING THAT BURDEN TO BE SHIFTED SOMEWHERE ELSE, TO THE NEIGHBORHOODS, FOR EXAMPLE, WE ARE NOT REALLY RELIEVING THE PROBLEM OF THE PARKING AND THE CARS. WE ARE JUST SHIFTING THAT. SO I DON'T LIKE THE IDEA OF ZERO PARKING AND WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT ANY TIME WE ARE CREATING A -- MOVING A BURDEN FROM THE DEVELOPMENT TO SOMETHING ELSE, YOU KNOW, HOW ARE WE GOING TO ACCOMMODATE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO FEEL THE PAIN FOR IT? I WROTE YOU A LONG EMAIL. I WILL LET YOU DIGEST THAT. IN THERE ARE SOME ESOTERIC THINGS ABOUT THE WHOLE MIXED USE CONCEPT OF OUR ZONING CATEGORIES. WE ARE NOT REALLY MIXED USE IN SOME OF OUR OTHER CATEGORIES. I THINK WE SHOULD CLEAN UP OUR MIXED USE ZONING AND CATEGORIES AND IT GETS A LITTLE ESOTERIC AND MAYBE I WILL WRITE SOMETHING ELSE OUT INSTEAD OF TALKING ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU.
03:36:12.255: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU.
03:36:21.897: >> HI, MY NAME ADAM GOODMAN. I LIVE AT 400 VIRGINIA AVENUE. I SUPPORT THE T1 ZONING ENTHUSIASTICALLY. AS JOAN SAID, WE ARE FACING TWO CRISIS IN OUR COMMUNITY AND BEYOND. AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND CLIMATE CHANGE. THE PRICES CONTINUE TO SKYROCKET FOR HOUSING AND WE HAVE -- THE SEMCOG ESTIMATES HAVE THAT WE HAVE 80,000 PEOPLE DRIVING INTO THE CITY EVERY DAY TO GO TO WORK OR SCHOOL. AND ALSO AS I THINK JOAN SAID, YOU KNOW, TRANSPORTATION IS ONE OF THE SINGLE LARGEST CATEGORIES OF CONTRIBUTORS OF CARBON EMISSIONS. SIMPLY PUT, WE HAVE TO FIND WAYS TO GET PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO LIVE CLOSER TO WHERE THEY WORK, WHERE THEY GO TO SCHOOL, AND SO ON. IN THE TIME THAT I HAVE BEEN IN ANN ARBOR, ABOUT 15 YEARS, IT'S BEEN THE CASE THAT ALMOST ALL OF OUR MAJOR HOUSING PROJECTS HAVE BEEN DENSE, HIGH-RISE CONSTRUCTION DOWNTOWN. I'M TOTALLY IN NAV FAVOR OF THII THINK IT'S GREAT. CONSIDEREDALONE, IT WILL NEVER BE A SOLUTION TO THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE IN OUR COMMUNITY. WE INT NEED TO LOOK BEYOND DOWN. BUILDING DENSER CONSTRUCTION ALONG TRANSIT CORRIDORS SEEMS LIKE A GREAT PLACE TO START. IN PARTICULAR, YOU KNOW, THE T1 ZONING, WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT TRANSIT-ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT IN ANN ARBOR FOR SEVERAL YEARS AS FAR AS I CAN REMEMBER, AND SO IT'S GREAT TO FINALLY SEE SOME MOVEMENT ON THIS AND SOME ACTUAL TANGIBLE PROGRESS. T1 ZONING WILL NOT CHANGE OUR CITY OVERNIGHT. OF COURSE AS THE CITY STAFF SAID, EVEN ONCE WE ADD THIS ZONING DESIGNATION TO OUR BOCKS WE STILL HAVE TO ACTUAL -- BOOKS WE STILL HAVE TO ACTUALLY REZONE PARCELS TO THIS. SO, YOU KNOW, IF THERE ARE IMPERFECTIONS IN THIS AS IT STANDS, I'M SURE YOU WILL WORK THROUGH THOSE FIRST OF ALL, BUT THEN THERE WILL BE FURTHER OPPORTUNITIES FOR DEBATE AND DISCUSSION ON THIS. PEOPLE SEEM TO BE CONCERNED THAT THIS, IS YOU KNOW, BEING FOISTED UPON US ALL OF A SUDDEN AND I DON'T SEE IT THAT WAY. WHAT I DO SEE HERE IS THE BEGINNING OF A RECOGNITION THAT IN OUR TOWN WE NEED TO WORK ON HOUSING FOR PEOPLE, AND NOT FOR CARS. AND THIS HAS MORE OF AN EFFECT THAN YOU MIGHT THINK, BECAUSE YOU REMOVE THE REQUIREMENT FOR DEVELOPERS TO BUILD SPACE FOR CARS, THAT MAKES THEIR COSTS GO DOWN, WHICH MEANS THAT THE COSTS OF THE HOUSING ALSO GO DOWN. WE CAN HAVE UNSUBSIDIZED MARKET RACE HOUSING AT A LOWER PRICE THAN WHAT IS CURRENTLY STANDARD IN OUR CITY. AND SO JUST ONCE AGAIN, I REALLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO APPROVE THIS, AND RECOMMEND IT FOR APPROVAL TO COUNCIL. THANK YOU.
03:39:11.600: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU.
03:39:23.078: >> HELLO AGAIN. I HAVE A LOT TO SAY ON THIS, I WILL PROBABLY HIT MY TIME LIMIT. HERE. FIRST THING I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS THE PUBLIC INPUT AND PROCESS SINCE THAT'S COME UP IN DISCUSSION, AND OLD HABITS DIE HARD AND I READ THROUGH THE PACKET AND READ THROUGH SOME OF THE LETTERS THAT PEOPLE WROTE AHEAD OF TIME, BRINGING UP PROCESS QUESTIONS. AND FIRST, I WOULD LIKE TO THANK MS. DELEO AND STAFF FOR ALL THE WORK COMBING THROUGH THE MASTER PLAN DOCUMENTS AND HIGHLIGHTING ALL OF THE VARIOUS WAYS THIS THOSE.AL SUPPORTS THE GOALS IN BUT I ALSO WANT US TO RECOGNIZE THAT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE DOCUMENTS REPRESENTS COUNTLESS MEETINGS, YEARS OF WORK, PUBLIC INPUT FROM STAKEHOLDERS, ACROSS THE BOARD, APPROVALS BY THIS BODY AND APPROVALS BY CITY COUNCIL. IT'S DECADES OF WORK THAT HAVE ALREADY GONE INTO THOSE DOCUMENTS. SO THIS DISCUSSION DIDN'T START TODAY, AND IT CERTAINLY WON'T END TODAY. ANOTHER POINT I HAVE HEARD BANDIED ABOUT IN THE DISCUSSION THAT HAS HAPPENED, WHILE WE ARE BA TO EMBARK ON A MASTER PLAN UPDATE AND WE HAVE EMBARKED ON A TRANSPORTATION PLAN UPDATE AND MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T MAKE ANY CAKES UNTIL WE KNOW WHAT THE PLAN IS. AND -- ANY UPDATES UNTIL WE KNOW WHAT THE PLAN IS. AND THAT DOES A DISSERVICE. THIS IS ROOTED, AGAIN, IN A LONG HISTORY OF COMMUNITY CONVERSATION. IT'S NOT COMING OUT OF NOWHERE. AND IT'S GOING TO TAKE YEARS BEFORE THOSE PLANS KICK IN. AND WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHETHER THEY WILL BE ADOPTED AND WHEN THEY ARE DRAFTED. IT'S HAPPENED IN OTHER CITIES. THEY ARE GOING THROUGH TWO OR THREE YEARS THROUGH THE PROCESS AND THEN COUNTY DECIDES THEY DON'T LIKE IT. AND THEN THAT'S THE BEGINNING OF THE PROCESS OF AMENDING OUR ORDINANCES. ONCE WE GET A PLAN, THE PLAN DOESN'T WRITE THE ORDINANCES. THE PLAN TELLS US WHAT WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT DOING, WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT WE ARE DOING HERE. SO IT COULD BE EVEN MORE YEARS BEFORE WE GET TO THE POINT WHERE WE ARE MAKING REAL ORDINANCE UPDATES. SO I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO WAIT MANY YEARS BEFORE WE MAKE ANY CHANGES TO OUR ORDINANCE WHEN WE HAVE ALREADY HAD MANY YEARS OF WORK THAT HAVE GONE INTO THIS AND WE SHOULD BE RELYING ON ALL OF THIS WORK THAT'S COME BEFORE. JUST TO GET INTO A FEW DETAILS, ONE THING I NOTICED AND MAYBE RESEARCH THE AIRPORT, F.A.A. HAS PRACTICAL HEIGHT LIMITS WITHIN A CERTAIN DISTANCE OF THE AIRPORT. I KNOW THIS IS A FACTOR IN THE SOUTH STATE AREA. AND PERHAPS OTHER AREAS, SO THERE ARE ACTUAL PRACTICAL HEIGHT LIMITS BUT I THINK HAVING THE BUFFERS WORKS FOR ME. I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING TO CONTINUE TO HEAR WHAT PEOPLE HAVE TO SAY. I'M FULLY SUPPORTIVE OF THE PARKING MINIMUMS. I THINK IT'S ESSENTIAL WE SHOULDN'T MAKE PEOPLE PAY FOR PARKING THAT THEY DON'T WANT OR NEED AND IT SUPPORTS THE OVERARCHING GOAL. I HAVE -- WELL, I HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS AND I WILL EMAIL YOU ALL OF THOSE QUESTIONS AS THIS GOES FORWARD. THANK YOU ALL.
03:42:29.231: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU.
03:42:42.411: >> AGAIN, JIM PIKE. TONIGHT HAS BEEN AN INTERESTING AND EXCITING CHALLENGE FOR ME BECAUSE OF MY PUBLIC SPEAKING ANXIETY. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT -- SO I JUST WROTE SOMETHING THAT I CAN READ QUICKLY HERE. IN THE PAST YEAR, A NUMBER OF BIG CHANGES HAVE STARTED HAPPENING ACROSS THE COUNTRY WITH RESPECT TO OUTDATED ZONING CODES AND THE PROBLEMS THEY ARE CAUSING. THERE'S MINNEAPOLIS' 2040 PLAN, DURHAM, NORTH CAROLINA, EXPANDED HOUSING CHOICES ORDINANCE AND OREGON EVEN ACROSS THE ENTIRE STATE PASSED A LAW ESSENTIALLY BANNING EXCLUSIONARY SINGLE FAMILY ZONING. AUSTIN, TEXAS, IS ALSO CURRENTLY WORKING ON CHANGES. THEY MADE AND ARE MAKING THESE CHANGES IN ORDER TO ADDRESS WORSENING HOUSING CRISES AMONG OTHER CONCERNS. WE HERE IN ANN ARBOR NEED TO GET ON BOARD WITH THESE KINDS OF ZONING CHANGES TO BETTER ADDRESS OUR OWN HOUSING CRISIS AND RELATED ISSUES OF CONCERN AND I THINK THIS IS A GOOD START. I WOULD BE HAPPY TO SEE MORE PUBLIC INPUT REGARDING THE DETAILS OF THIS AND I'M SURE IT WILL DEVELOP MORE AS WE GO ALONG, BUT ON GENERAL PRINCIPLE, I SUPPORT VERY STRONGLY THIS NEW T1 ZONING DESIGNATION. SO THANK YOU.
03:43:58.887: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU.
03:44:07.262: >> MY NAME IS DAVID SILKWORTH, I LIVE ON CHARLTON APARTMENT 301. I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, IT'S REALLY UNFORTUNATE THAT, YOU KNOW, T1 ZONING, I THINK PROVIDES SOME OPPORTUNITY, BUT I DON'T THINK IT REALLY PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING THE WAY IT'S BEING SPOKEN ABOUT HERE TONIGHT. AND THE REASON IS BECAUSE IT'S VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT THEY ARE DOING IN MINNEAPOLIS. THEY SAID THAT, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE WE DEVELOPED OUR DOWNTOWN SO MUCH, WE WANT TO ELIMINATE ALL THE HEIGHT REQUIREMENTS DOWN THERE, AND WE WANT TO PROMOTE DEVELOPMENT ALONG OUR TRANSPORTATION CORRIDORS. AND THEY SAID THAT BECAUSE THEY HAVE A STATE LAW, THAT MAKE IT'S MANDATORY THAT YOU INCLUDE AFFORDABLE UNITS THEY CAN DO THAT. BUT THEY SPECIFIED THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE THAT MANDATED. WITHOUT THAT MANDATE, YOU WILL JUST GET LITTLE BIT OF MONEY WITHOUT THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUND WITHOUT THE ACTUAL UNITS THEMSELVES. THAT'S REALLY, REALLY IMPORTANT. I THINK THAT UNLESS YOU SET HARD HEIGHT LIMITS AND -- BECAUSE IN MICHIGAN, WE HAVE A DIFFERENT LAW. IT'S GOT TO BE VOLUNTARY. AND HOW DO YOU ACCOMPLISH THAT VOLUNTARY ASPECT. YOU SET A HARD CAP ON THE HEIGHT AND THEN YOU JUST SAY IF YOU WANT MORE, YOU HAVE TO -- YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE PREMIUMS LIKE WE DO DOWNTOWN. AND ANYWAY, THAT'S JUST MY THOUGHT. THANKS.
03:45:36.618: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU.
03:45:51.300: >> GOOD EVENING, COMMISSION, STAFF, KURT WESTPHAL, I LIVE ON CHARTER PLACE. AS ALWAYS, THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE AND THE HARD WORK OF PUTTING OUR VALUES NOT JUST INTO PLANS BUT ALSO INTO PRACTICE. I WANT TO START WITH A QUOTE FROM PRESIDENT OBAMA'S HOUSING DEVELOPMENT TOOLKIT. IT'S FROM 2016. BARRIERS TO HOUSING DEVELOPMENT DEVELOPMENTEXACERBATING THE SIT. IT GOES ON TO LIST LOCAL POLICIES SUCH AS THE ZONING RESTRICTIONS AND OFF-STREET PARKING REGULATIONS AS DRIVERS OF THE HOUSING CRISIS. I THINK THE EFFORT WE ARE BEGINNING TO DISCUSS TONIGHT WILL COME TO BE RECOGNIZED AS ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE POLICY DECISIONS OF OUR GENERATIONS IN ANN ARBOR, PARTICULARLY FOR EQUITY, THE ENVIRONMENT AND FOR QUALITY OF LIFE IN THE CITY. SO WHAT ARE THE FACTS ON THE GROUND RIGHT NOW? WE ARE SEEING INCREASED ENROLLMENT AND EXPANDING JOB BASE. GENERALLY MOST PEOPLE THINK THIS IS BENEFICIAL, CONSIDERING OTHER MIDWESTERN CITIES WHERE THERE ARE ISN'T JOB GROWTH AND ANY IMPACT THAT HAS ON CITY SERVICES. SO WE KNOW MORE PEOPLE NEED TO GET TO WORK AND GET TO SCHOOL IN ANN ARBOR, BUT WHAT EXACTLY DOES IT MEAN AND WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT IT? ONCE CONSEQUENCE IS TRAFFIC, 80,000 CARS COMING TO THE CITY AND GROWING. WE DON'T HAVE MEANINGFUL REGIONAL TRANSIT YET AND EVEN THOUGH A LOT OF PEOPLE TAKE AATA, THEY WOULD RATHER LIVE HERE AND TAKE TRANSIT, WALK OR BIKE INSTEAD. ANOTHER CONSEQUENCE IS HOUSING AND EQUITY CRISIS IN THE COUNTY, DUE TO CONSTRAINED SUPPLY WHERE THE JOBS ARE. THIS GIVES MANY MIDDLE AND LOWER INCOME WORKERS NO CHOICE BUT TO LIVE FARTHER AWAY AND SPEND MORE OF THEIR MONEY ON GAS AND CAR MAINTENANCE. MORE HOUSING UNITS ARE NEEDED NEAR JOBS AND WE HAVE A CLIMATE CRISIS, THIS IS DUE IN LARGE PART BECAUSE HUNDREDS OF GOVERNMENTS DECIDED THAT OUR YARDS SHOULD BE BIG AND THIS GAVE CRUISE TO SPRAWL WHICH ERODES OUR ENVIRONMENTAL, FISCAL AND SOCIAL FABRIC. WE CAN HELP THOUSANDS MORE PEOPLE LEAD LOWER CARBON LIVES RIGHT IN OUR CITY BY CHANGING OUR OUTDATED ZONING. POLICIES LIKE THE ONE IN FRONT OF YOU TONIGHT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO ADDRESS ALL OF THESE ISSUES AT THEIR CAR. A GREATER SUPPLY OF HOMES THAT WILL BE SMALLER, CLOSER TO WORK, AND LESS DEPENDENT ON CARS OR CAR-FREE. IN ALL HELPS TO MITIGATE THE AFFORDABILITY CARBON FOOTPRINT AND TRAFFIC ISSUES, AND IT DOES IT IN A WAY THAT STRENGTHENS CITY SERVICES AND QUALITY OF LIFE FOR THOSE ALREADY LIVING HERE. IN SUMMARY, THANK YOU FOR PROPOSING A TOOL THAT THE COMMUNITY HAS BEEN REQUESTING IN MANY PLANS FOR MANY YEARS.
03:48:49.611: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU.
03:49:08.663: >> JULIE RITTER, 920 KATHERINE. I BET YOU CAN TELL HOW I'M FEELING. WHAT ARE YOU THINKING? WE HAVE A $600,000 TRANSPORTATION PLAN INITIATED BY THE CITY THAT'S ALMOST DONE AND YOU GUYS ARE JUST BLOWING RIGHT PAST IT. THE MASTER PLAN PROCESS BEGAN. I'M ON THE COMMITTEE THAT WAS CHOOSING THE CONSULTANT, BRETT LEN AART GAVE US EXPLICIT INSTRUCTIONS THAT THE CONSULTANT WOULD BE CONSULTED TO ENGAGE EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM AND EVERYBODY IN THE CITY AT EVERY LEVEL AS FAR AND AS WIDE AS I BELIEVE TO SOLICIT ENGAGEMENT, INFORMATION, VALUES, IDEAS ABOUT THE CITY, COME UP WITH NEW VISIONS FOR THE CITY, OVERLAYS, CHARACTER DISTRICTS, ZONING, WHATEVER, AND AFTER THAT PROCESS IS DONE, WHICH HAS AN 18 MONTH TIME LINE AT THIS POINT, THEN PUT ZONING AND ORDINANCES IN PLACE TO BRING THAT VISION TO LIFE. EVERY SINGLE CONSULTANT GROUP THAT WE HAVE INTERVIEWED HAS BEEN A NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED GROUP. THEY ARE PROFESSIONALS. THEY HAVE WIDE EXPERIENCE. DO YOU THINK THEY HAVE NOT HEARD OF T1 TRANSIT SUPPORT DISTRICTS? DO YOU THINK THEY WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THEM? MY OTHER CONCERN IS THE TRANSIT PIECE. ANN ARBOR HAS NO TRANSIT. WE HAVE A BUS SYSTEM. WE HAVE THE AAATA, IT STRUGGLES MIGHTILY TO PROVIDE SERVICE. IT DOESN'T REACH OUT THE OUTLYING DISTRICTS RIGHT NOW WITH THE SERVICE LEVEL THEY NEED. IT'S NOT REGIONAL TRANSIT. IT'S NOT A COMMUTER RAIL. IT'S NOT LIGHT RAIL. IT'S NOT MONORAIL. THERE'S NOTHING THAT IS STITCHING THIS CITY TO GO TO GET INTO ANN ARBOR, YOU HAVE TO DRIVE A CAR. WHERE ARE THOSE CARS GOING TO GO? THE UNIVERSITY IS PROPOSING A 12-STORY HOSPITAL AND A COLLEGE OF PHARMACY WITH NO NEW PARKING SPACES. THAT HOTEL WITH NO NEW PARKING IS BEING PROPOSED FOR HURON STREET. WHERE ARE THESE CARS GOING TO GO IN. THE OLD FOURTH WARD IS PARKED UP. I HAVE UBER DRIVERS, LYFT DRIVERS AND FRIENDS AND FAMILY PARKING IN MY DRIVEWAY TO GO TO THE CONDOS NEXT DOOR BECAUSE THEY CAN'T FIND A PLACE TO PARK. SO UNTIL WE GET TRANSIT, WHY HAVE A TRANSIT CORRIDOR? AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS NOT PROVIDED BY TRANSIT. MARKET FORCES WILL NEVER PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND YOU ALL KNOW IT. YOU ALL KNOW FOR A FACT THAT AFFORDABLE HOUSING AT SCALE WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IN THIS ECONOMIC SYSTEM WHEN YOU HAVE FOUNDATIONS, NONPROFITS, GRANTS, GOVERNMENT SUPPORT, IN PLACE. SOME OF THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AT SCALE DEVELOPMENTS THAT I HAVE HEARD OF HAVE 12 DIFFERENT FUNDING SOURCES. OTHERWISE, IT'S JUST PREMIUMS BECAUSE MARKET FORCES ARE MARKET FORCES AND EVERYONE WILL GO FOR THE HIGH RENT. SORRY. THIS IS REALLY UPSETTING TO ME. I FEEL SO DISRESPECTED AND EVERYBODY IN THE PROCESS OF THE MASTER PLAN IS SO DISRESPECTED BY THIS AND EVERYBODY ON THE TRANSPORTATION PLAN IS SO DISRESPECTED BY THIS. THANK YOU.
03:52:20.622: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN THE AUDIENCE WISHING TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION? SEEING NO UP WITH, I WILL CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING AND I WILL READ THE MOTION. THE ANN ARBOR CITY PLANNING COMMISSION HEREBY RECOMMENDS THAT THE MAYOR AND THE CITY COUNCIL APPROVE THE AMENDMENTS TO CHAPTER 55 UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE TO CREATE NEW ZONING DISTRICT T1 TRANSIT SUPPORT DISTRICT. DO I HAVE A COMMISSIONER THAT WILL MOVE. MOVED BY COMMISSIONER SAUVE, SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER BRIGGS. WE ARE IN DISCUSSION. COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN.
03:52:54.556: >> Councilmember Ackerman: THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR AND THANK YOU TO STAFF FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND THANK YOU TO RESIDENTS AND EVERY PART OF THE CONVERSATION. I ALSO APPRECIATE MR. CHAIR THE OPPORTUNITY TO POSTPONE THIS AND TABLE THIS AND LISTEN TO THE FEEDBACK THAT WE GOT, BOTH PRACTICAL AND WITH RESPECT TO THE PROCESS. I'M GLAD WE ARE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION. IT'S EXACTLY WHY WE ARE HERE. I'M EXCITED BY THIS. I THINK -- WELL, FIRST OF ALL, I HAVE BEEN SITTING ON THIS COMMISSION, WAITING FOR THIS FOR TWO YEARS AND AS A MEMBER OF THE COUNCIL, I HAVE BEEN EXCITED ABOUT THIS AS WELL. I THINK THAT SUPPLY OF HOUSING IS ABSOLUTELY PART OF THE CONVERSATION OF AFFORDABILITY. WE HAD A QUOTE FROM THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION THERE, QUOTES FROM THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION, QUOTES FROM THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION, SAYING THE SAME THINGS. ECONOMISTS AROUND THE COUNTRY AND AROUND THE WORLD ARE ALIGNED IN THE FACT THAT AS OUR COUNTRY GOES FROM, YOU KNOW, 83% OF RESIDENTS LIVING IN CITIES TODAY TO 87% PROJECTED IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS LIVING IN CITIES, WE HAVE HUGE DEMAND AND HERE WE HAVE HUGE DEMAND IN THAT WE HAVE MORE JOBS THAN WE HAVE PEOPLE. WE HAVE HUGE DEMAND IN THAT ENROLLMENT IS INCREASING AND THE WAY IN WHICH WE HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH THAT IS MOSTLY BY ADDING DENSITY DOWNTOWN. AND AS A MEMBER OF COUNCIL, AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF FOLKS ON THE SOUTHEAST SIDE OF THE TOWN, I HEAR THIS TENSION OF, YOU KNOW, THE CITY'S JOB BASE IS GROWING. THE ENROLLMENT ISWING. WE LOVE OUR NEIGHBORHOODS. WE WANT TO PRESERVE THE CHARACTER OF OUR NEIGHBORHOODS. THESE PEOPLE HAVE TO LIVE SOMEWHERE. DOWNTOWN IS THE BEST. BUT WE NEED SOME OTHER AREA OF OUR CITY BESIDES JUST DOWNTOWN TO PUT ALL OF THAT DENSITY. WE CAN'T RELY ON ONE NEIGHBORHOOD FOR ALL OF OUR DENSITY. AND I THINK THIS PRESENTS TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY TO RELEASE SOME OF THAT VALVE. TO FIND OTHER OPPORTUNITIES FOR DENSITY. AND SO GENER ON PREMISE, I'M EXCITED BY THIS. I AGREE THAT IT SHOULD BE NEAR TRANSIT CORRIDORS. I LIVED FOR 16 YEARS IN THIS CITY WITHOUT A CAR AND IT WORKED REALLY WELL AND IT'S ONLY WORKED BETTER SINCE I WAS A KID. I STARTED, YOU KNOW, COMMUTING BY MYSELF TO CLASSES AT U OF M WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL, ON THE 5, PACKARD, AND SPENT A LOT OF TIME TAKING BUSES NEAR EISENHOWER AND STATE STREET AND WHILE A LOT OF AREAS IN WASHTENAW COUNTY ARE IN TRANSIT DESERTS, THE TRANSIT CORRIDORS WE HAVE IN TOWN WORK REALLY WELL, AAS L AS LONG AS YOU WORKR LIVE ALONG ONE OF THE OUR TRANSIT CORRIDORS, IT WORKS REALLY WELL. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHERE IT DOES WORK WELL, HOW CAN WE MAKE IT WORK EVEN BETTER. I -- BUT I DO HAVE A FEW KIND OF JUST PRACTICAL QUESTIONS AND ELEMENTS TO RAISE HERE IN RESPONSE TO THINGS WE HAVE GOTTEN IN WRITING AND PUBLIC COMMENT. FIRST ON THE PRIMARY USE TABLE, -- OH, ALSO JUST SAY ABOUT INCREASING SUPPLIES. IT MEANS TO PROMOTE AFFORDABILITY, WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE SERVING LOW-INCOME HOUSEHOLDS BY INCREASING SUPPLY, BUT WE WILL BE HELPING, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE WHO LIVE AND WORK HERE. AND PEOPLE WHO GO TO SCHOOL HERE. I MEAN, IF YOU LOOK AT THE DOWNTOWN STUDENT UNITS THAT HAVE BEEN BUILT, RAND MARK WAS ONE OF THE -- LAND MARK WAS ONE OF THE FIRST SINCE THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY AT THE CORNER OF THE SOUTH U AND NORTH FOREST AND AS THEY ARE GETTING OUT COMPETED, THEIR PRICES ARE DROPPING STEADILY AND IT'S BECAUSE OF THAT COMPETITION THAT THERE IS INCREASED SUPPLY. THERE ARE MORE OPTIONS FOR NOW THESE STUDENTS BUT HOPEFULLY THE GENERAL WORKING PUBLIC WIT T1, THAT -- THAT THOSE OPTIONS ALLOW FOR MORE CHOICE AND THOSE CHOICES WILL EVENTUALLY MAKE OLDER PROPERTIES CHEAPER. SO GOING TO THE PRIMARY USE TABLE --
03:57:20.722: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN. WE ARE PAST OUR TIME. SO I WOULD LIKE TO GET A MOTION TO EXTEND UNTIL 11:20. WILL YOU MOVE THAT?
03:57:27.562: >> Councilmember Ackerman: MOVED.
03:57:29.397: >> Chair Milshteyn: AND SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER. ALL THOSE IN FAVOR. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? WE'RE EXTENDED UNTIL 11:20.
03:57:40.108: >> C11:20.MY APOLOGIES.
03:57:44.812: >> Councilmember Ackerman: I'M SORRY. I GOT CARRIED AWAY. WITH RESPECT TO THE PRIMARY USES WITH RESPECT TO OUTDOOR RECREATION AND RAIL RIGHT-OF-WAIF NOT BEING PERMITTED. FOR THE OUTDOOR RECREATION, CAN YOU GIVE US A SENSE OF WHAT THOSE USES ARE? THOSE WOULDN'T BE PUBLIC PARKS OR USE OF OPEN SPACE ON PRIVATE PROPERTY, RIGHT? I GUESS -- I MEAN, I HOPE THAT'S NOT RIGHT, BUT WHAT IS OUTDOOR RECREATION AS A USE?
03:58:13.441: >> BEFORE LOOKING UP THE DEFINITION, IT'S GOLF COURSES, PRIVATE, LIKE A TENNIS CLUB, OUTDOOR SWIMMING POOL, PRIVATE OUTDOOR SWIMMING POOL. SO WE HAVE EXCLUDED THEM. EVERYTHING IS UP FOR DISCUSSION. WE EXCLUDED THEM BECAUSE WE FELT THEY WERE SPACE HOGS.
03:58:35.029: >> Councilmember Ackerman: YES. COMMISSIONER BRIGGS THANKFULLY PULLED IT UP. IT'S PROVIDING OUTDOOR RECREATIONAL SERVICES, MINIATURE GOLF, OUTDOOR THEATERS AND THANK YOU. THAT MAKES SENSE. I BRING THAT UP, BECAUSE I THINK AS WE -- IF WE ARE TO DENSIFY OTHER CORRIDORS, PAYING ATTENTION TO THE OPEN SPACE AND THE GREEN SPACE IN THOSE AREAS WILL BE VERY IMPORTANT AND I WAS CONCERNED THAT THAT WAS PART OF IT AND OBVIOUSLY IT ISN'T. SO THAT'S REALLY -- THE OTHER ONE WAS RAIL RIGHT-OF-WAY. WHILE WE DON'T HAVE LIGHT RAIL IN THE CITY NOW, WHO IS TO SAY WE WON'T IN 50 YEARS AND SIMILAR TO PRIVATE PROPERTY DONATIONS FOR THE TREE LINE TRAIL. WOULD THIS PREVENT ANY, YOU KNOW, SAY PRIVATE DONATIONS OF LAND THAT WOULD SUPPORT THE CONSTRUCTION OF LIGHT RAIL IN THE FUTURE?
03:59:28.916: >> THAT'S A VERY INTERESTING QUESTION. I BELIEVE THAT HAD THE RAIL IS IN OUR ORDINANCE BECAUSE ANN ARBOR WE ZONE TO THE CENTER LINE OF THE ROAD, RIGHT? WE -- SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE ZONING MAP, THERE IS ZONING APPLIED TO ROAD, HIGHWAY AND RAIL RIGHT-OF-WAY. AND SO I THINK THAT THAT'S WHY IT'S THERE. UP FOR DISCUSSION, I -- I -- I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR A DEVELOPMENT TO HAVE A BIG FLAT LAND USE LIKE RAIL THROUGH IT, BUT THEN AGAIN, YOU WILL NEED THAT IF WE WERE TO HAVE RAIL ACCESS, YOU WILL NEED THAT ACCESS POINT. YOU MIGHT NEED TO LOOK INTO THE HISTORY OF WHY WE -- WHEN AND WHY WE ALLOW RAIL TO BEGIN WITH AND THEN IF IT'S APPROPRIATE TO ADD IT HERE, WE CAN ADD IT.
04:00:25.306: >> Councilmember Ackerman: COOL.
04:00:27.475: >> I WOULD ALSO SPECULATE IF THOSE TRANSIT SYSTEMS WERE TO SORT OF DEVELOP IN THE CITY, MOST LIKELY THEY WOULD BE PAR OF A PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY PLANNING EFFORT AS OPPOSED TO PRIVATE PROPERTY. I THINK IN MOST OF THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES, WHERE YOU SEE THOSE SYSTEMS DEVELOP, THEY ARE EITHER ACQUIRED RIGHT-OF-WAY, OR MAYBE SHARED WITH ANOTHER TRANSIT PER EXISTING CORRIDOR, BUT IN MOST CASES THEY ARE PUBLY ON THE PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY, BUT I THINK IT'S WORTH THE.
04:00:59.474: >> AND THEN WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SERVICES, THAT'S PERMITTED AS A PRIMARY USE. WHY IS THAT A PERMITTED PRIMARY USE?
04:01:06.914: >> THE T FACILITY IS THE TOWER D THE FACILITY IS THE ANTENNA AND BECAUSE IT'S ALLOWED IN THE C3. SO IT CAN BE CALLED OUT FOR MORE DETAILED DISCUSSION.
04:01:24.432: >> I THINK WE SHOULD REVISIT THAT, SPEAKING OF KIND OF SPACE HOGS A PUBLIC UTILITY, LIKE IN A DISTRICT THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE MIXED USE SEEMS LITTLE OFF TO ME. SO I WOULD LIKE TO EXPLORE THAT ONE MORE. AND THEN THE FINAL ONE I HAD AND THE PRIMARY USE TABLE IT OFFICE. I DIDN'T SEE OFFICE IN HERE AND THIS SEEMS LIKE A GOOD PLACE TO HAVE OFFICE SPACE.
04:01:47.488: >> I WOULD AGREE.
04:01:48.923: >> Councilmember Ackerman: OKAY. COOL. MOVING TO THE DOORS SECTION AND BUILDING DESIGN, I THINK, MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT, Q4. THERE'S -- IT MENTIONS ENTRANCES AT BUILDINGS SHOULD BE ON STREETS AND I'M WONDERING IF WE WANT TO SPECIFY THE PRIMARY STREET WHERE RELEVANT, IF IT'S -- I FEEL LIKE WE HAVE ENCOUNTERED A LOT ON MAIN STREET WHERE A LOT OF BUILDINGS THAT ARE ON CORNERS AND THE FRONTING THE SIDE STREET, WHICH REALLY ISN'T THE INTENT OF HAVING A MAIN STREET, AND REALLY KIND OF INTENSIFIES THE USE OF THE SIDE STREET, WHICH IS USUALLY MORE RESIDENTIAL IN THE CASE OF MAINN STREET AND SO TRYING TO PROACTIVELY GET THESE BUILDINGS MORE ORIENTED TO THE MAIN CORRIDOR WOULD BE SOMETHING.
04:02:38.739: >> I WILL TAKE A LOOK AT THAT LANGUAGE.
04:02:40.508: >> Councilmember Ackerman: COOL. THEN WITH RESPECT TO THE PREMIUMS CONVERSATION, I ACTUALLY REALLY APPRECIATED THAT PUBLIC INPUT. I THINK, YOU KNOW, KIND OF THE THREE PREMIUMS IF WE WERE TO EXPLORE THEM IN THIS AREA WOULD BE AFFORDABLE HOUSING, SUSTAINABILITY, AND OPEN SPACE. I THINK IF WE ARE GOING TO BE DENSIFYING THESE CORRIDORS, THERE'S A LOT OF -- I MEAN, I THINK THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND THE SUSTAINABILITY SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES. AT LEAST I HOPE THEY DO. ON THE OPEN SPACE, I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY THESE ARE AREAS WITHOUT A LOT OF, LIKE, GREEN AMENITIES RIGHT NOW. IT'S JUST KIND OF LIKE LAWNS OF CORPORATE OFFICE BUILDINGS OR PARKING LOTS. I THINK IF WE ARE GOING TO DENSIFY IT, LOOKING AT WAYS TO INCORPORATE GREEN SPACE WOULD BE BENEFICIAL TO THE COMMUNITY. ESPECIALLY IF THESE ARE GATEWAYS TO THE CITY. SO I THINK THAT'S A GOOD STATEMENT OF WHO WE ARE AS WELL. THEN WITH RESPECT TO THE PARKING, I THINK WE WILL HAVE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH RESPECT TO THAT. I DON'T KNOW WHERE I FALL IN THAT, BUT I KNOW IT WILL BE A TOPIC OF INTEREST. YES, THAT'S EVERYTHING I HAD AND REALLY APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S PUBLIC INPUT, BOTH PRACTICAL AND UNPROUNPROCESSED AND I HOPE THIS JUST THE START OF THE CONVERSATION.
04:04:13.234: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER BRIGGS.
04:04:15.036: >> Commissioner Briggs: YES. THANKS FOR -- THANKS SO MUCH TO STAFF FOR BRINGING THIS TO US. I WILL MAKE SOME PRACTICAL COMMENTS TOWARDS THE END. I WANTED TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE -- I HEARD CONCERNS ABOUT THE PRO E SIS, ENGAGEMENT, TIMING, AND WHETHER THI IS EVEN NECESSARY BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE TRANSIT, AND WHETHER OR NOT WE ARE ACTUALLY ABLE TO ACHIEVE AFFORDABILITY. WITH REGARDS TO PROCESS, A NUMBER OF -- THIS HAS BEEN BROUGHT UP A FAIR AMOUNT IN THE PUBLIC COMMENTS BUT I THINK IT'S WORTH STRESSING AGAIN. AND YOU BROUGHT IT IN TERMS OF THE REVIEW OF THE PLANS BUT WE REALLY HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS FOR AT LEAST THE LAST DECADE. THIS IS MY SECOND TIME ON PLANNING COMMISSION AND WHAT I MOST REMEMBER FIRST CONVERSATION WAS THE REIMAGINE WASHTENAW PROJECT. THIS IS A LONG TIME COMING AND IF ANYTHING, I WISH -- I DON'T WISH THIS, BUT I THINK THAT WE SHOULD HAVE BROUGHT THIS FORWARD SOONER. I THINK IF IT FEELS LIKE IT'S BEEN THRUST UPON THE COMMUNITY, IT'S ONLY BECAUSE THERE'S A TIME LAG BETWEEN THOSE CONVERSATIONS SOMETIMES AND THAT IS ONE OF THE CHALLENGES OF MOVING THINGS FORWARD. SO I DON'T THINK THAT THIS IS -- IT HASN'T HAD A ROBUST PUBLIC PROCESS. I THINK IT HAS TO FURTHER REFINE THIS AND MAKE SURE THAT WE GET TO THE APPROPRIATE T1 DISTRICT, BUT I THINK THAT IT'S CLEAR THAT WE HAVE BUILT A LOT OF PUBLIC INPUT TO GET HERE, AND TO KISS COUNT THAT, I THINK IS REALLY DISRESPECTFUL TO THE PEOPLE WHO ENGAGED IN THOSE PROCESSES AND SPENT THEIR TIME AND EFFORT INTO IT. IN TERMS OF ENGAGEMENT, I HEARD SOME QUESTIONS AROUND SORT OF NEIGHBORHOOD ENGAGEMENT AND OUR NEIGHBORHOOD LISTS AND I WOULD CONCUR THAT WE PROBABLY DO NEED TO RELOOK AT THAT. I SPENT A LITTLE BIT OF TIME VOLUNTEERING FOR THE CITY AS A NEIGHBORHOOD ENGAGEMENT -- NEIGHBORHOOD ENGAGEMENT ROLE. THAT WASN'T NECESSARILY A ROLE THAT WAS WELCOMED BY EVERYBODY. BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I DID WHILE I WAS IN THAT ROLE WAS TO HELP FACILITATE THAT SURVEY OF NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATIONS. I WOULDN'T TAKE THAT LIST TO MEAN THAT THE SURVEY RESULTS THAT WE HAVE, THAT ALL OF THOSE OTHER ASSOCIATIONS ARE NOT ACTIVE. IT WAS JUST A RESPONSE TO THOSE SURVEYS AND I THINK THERE'S CERTAINLY OPPORTUNITY TO FOLLOW UP. I THINK MAYBE ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE HAVE AS A CITY IS THAT WE ASSUME WHEN WE SEND OUT THAT INFORMATION TO NEIGHBORHOOD LIAISONS THAT THEY ARE THEN GOING TO COMMUNICATE THAT TO THE REST OF THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD GROUPS AND THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY WHAT HAPPENS WITH IT AND WE HAVE SOME SURVEYS THAT DISCUSSES WHAT THEY DO WITH THAT. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT. THAT FIGURING OUT HOW WE BUILD UPON IT, I THINK IS GOOD. IN TERMS OF TIMING. AND WHETHER OR NOT THIS SHOULD BE HAPPENING NOW, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO MEMBERS, OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE, I THINK THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HEARD IN THAT PROCESS FROM SOME OF THESE EXPERTS WAS THAT WE SHOULDN'T PUT OFF OUR PLANNING, THAT WE HAVE TO CONTINUE WITH THE WORKING THAT WE ARE DOING AND CLEARLY SOMETHING THAT IS IN MULTIPLE PLANS THAT WE HAVE. I'M EXCITED TO SEE US MOVING FORWARD WITH IT. I THINK IT WAS -- I THINK WHAT WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW IS HOW THAT -- HOW IT APPROPRIATELY COMPLIMENTS THOSE PROCESSES THAT ARE GOING ON AND HOW WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THAT PROCESS THAT FEELS RIGHT. I MEAN, HONESTLY RIGHT NOW, THE ONLY FOLKS THAT WE HAVE COMMUNICATED WITH ARE NEIGHBORHOODS AND I'M NOT SURE THAT IS AS MANY FOLKS AS WE WANT TO HAVE IN THE CONVERSATION AS STAKEHOLDERS AND IT DIDN'T GET OUT FULLY INTO THE NEIGHBORHOODS. THEN WITH REGARDS NOT FACT THAT WE DON'T HAVE TRANSIT. ARE REALLY RESPECTING WHAT WE HAVE IN OUR COMMUNITY. SO I PRINTED OUT SOME PIECES FROM THE RIDE JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THIS AS PART OF THE PUBLIC RECORD. SO IN TERMS OF RIDERSHIP FOR 2018, WE HAD 6.8 MILLION RIDES IN OUR COMMUNITY, WHICH IS REALLY IMPRESSIVE. 6.6 MILLION OF THOSE WERE ON LOCAL FIXED ROUTES. WE HAVE A REALLY ROBUST TRANSIT SYSTEM IN OUR COMMUNITY AND WE ARE REALLY LUCKY IN WASHTENAW, WE HAVE TEN-MINUTE HEADWAYS AND OUR -- WE ARE FORTUNATE TO HAVE A REALLY INNOVATIVE TRANSIT AUTHORITY HERE WHO IS SEEKING GRANTS TO STUDY THINGS LIKE BUS RAPID TRANSIT AND ENHANCED -- MAKING USE OF TRAFFIC SIGNAL TECHNOLOGY AND CONNECTED CORRIDORS AND SO I THINK WE ACTUALLY ARE MOVING FORWARD A LOT ON TRANSIT. AND PARTICULARLY OUR HEAVIEST CORRIDOR IN TERMS OF TRANSIT IS THE CONNECTION BETWEEN YPSILANTI AND ANN ARBOR AND SO FOR ME, THINKING ABOUT THIS AS THE FIRST PLACE WE WOULD START, CERTAINLY WASHTENAW MAKES THE MOST SENSE. SO -- AND THEN WITH REGARDS TO AFFORDABILITY, I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE'RE RECOGNIZING THAT SIMPLY WITH ADDING DENSITY IN THOSE SPACES, THE MOST EXPENSIVE PIECE OF OUTSIDE OF HOUSING IN HOUSEHOLD EXPENSES IS TRANSPORTATION. AND SO WE ARE INCREASING AFFORDABILITY, JUST BY ALLOWING PEOPLE TO MAKE USE OF THAT TRANSIT AND OBVIOUSLY, LAND COSTS ARE MUCH HIGHER DOWNTOWN THAN THEY ARE ALONG THESE CORRIDORS. SO WE WOULD ANTICIPATE THAT THOSE HOUSING UNITS WOULD BE A LOT LESS EXPENSIVE THAN THEY ARE IN THE DOWNTOWN. I THINK WE ARE ADDRESSING AFFORDABILITY, EVEN WITHOUT THE AFFORDABILITY AND SO I DO THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA FOR US TO BE EXPLORING THOSE. SO THOSE ARE SOME OF MY THOUGHTS ABOUT SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT CAME UP IN TERMS OF SORT OF IMMEDIATE RECOMMENDATIONS TO EXPLORE. I DO THINK THAT WE MIGHT WANT TO THINK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT WHAT THAT BUFFER LOOKS LIKE BETWEEN NEIGHBORHOODS AND THE POTENTIAL -- THE POTENTIAL DENSE DEVELOPMENT THAT MIGHT OCCUR. RIGHT NOW THE -- THE -- HAVING THEM -- THE MAXIMUM WITHIN 300 FEET BEING 80 FEET, OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T HAVE MUCH DENSITY ALONG THESE CORRIDORS RIGHT NOW AND EVEN THOUGH THAT'S PERMISSIBLE, I THINK THE FEAR OF SEEING SOMETHING LIKE THAT HAPPENS SEEMS PRETTY CHALLENGING FOR SOME AND I THINK IT MIGHT BE BENEFICIAL TO LOOK MORE AT WHAT WE HAVE FOR OFFICE, WHICH I THINK IS 55 FEET MAYBE. MAYBE 55 FEET OR FOUR STORIES. WE HAVEN'T SEEN THIS REALIZED ALONG OUR CORRIDORS YET. WE HAVE SEEN THIS IN THE OFFICE, THE C1A AND C1AR, NO HEIGHT LIMITS RIGHT NOW AND FOR THE MOST PART WE HAVEN'T SEEN THOSE REALIZED. AND I DON'T THINK WE WOULD SEE JUST AN EXPLOSION OF GROWTH IF WE PASSED THIS. I THINK BEING SENSITIVE TO WHAT THAT RELATIONSHIP IS TO THE SURROUNDING NEIGHBORHOODS IS. SO THAT'S MY FIRST PIECE. AND THEN IN TERMS OF ENGAGEMENT, I WOULD BE CURIOUS TO HEAR WHERE WE THINK THIS SHOULD GO NEXT IN TERMS OF PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT. ARE THERE, YOU KNOW -- MAYBE I WILL LEAVE THAT FOR OTHERS TO MAKE COMMENTS ON.
04:11:54.061: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER SAUVE.
04:11:56.663: >> Commissioner Sauve: I WILL TRY TO BE BRIEF BUT TO THE STATEMENT OF TO GET INTO THE CITY YOU HAVE TO DRIVE A CAR AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS NOT PROVIDED BY TRANSIT, ABSOLUTELY FALSE. AS A SINGLE MOM, ON SUBSIDY, I HAD TO LIVE IN   YPSILANTI, ANDI HAD TO GO THROUGH NORTH WASHTENAW TO GET TO CLASS. FOR SOMEONE WHO ONLY LIVES IN A CERTAIN REALM. THOSE ARE FALSE STATEMENTS TO SOMEBODY WHO HAS GONE THROUGH ALL OF THOSE THINGS AND I THINK WE NEED TO CREATE MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR OTHER PEOPLE TO BE CLOSER AND HAVE STRONGER TRANSIT SYSTEMS TO DO ALL OF THESE THINGS AND GROW INTO PROFESSIONALS THAT CAN CONTRIBUTE BACK BACK TO THE CITY THROUGH COMMISSIONS AND COMMITTEES. AS WE INTERVIEW ALL OF THESE CONSUMMATES THEY HAVE NEVER RECOMMENDED US FREEZING ANY EFFORTS DURING THIS 18-MONTH PROCESS AND THAT TO PURSUE THIS ORDINANCE WOULD ONLY PROVIDE A TOOL FOR COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT -- LIKE, IMPLEMENTED HERE AS A TOOL INSTEAD OF SPECULATING THAT IT MIGHT BE IMPLEMENTED AFTER THE FACT. SO IF WE HAVE A T1, WE CAN ACTUALLY MAP THOSE INTO COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT WITH THE CONSULTANT, VERSUS THE CONSULTANT SPECULATING THAT IT'S SOMETHING THAT MIGHT GET IMPLEMENTED TO PLAY OUT THE PLAN AT THE END OF 18 MONTHS. SO THAT'S HOW I FEEL RIGHT NOW. I'M EXCITED FOR IT TO GO FORWARD AND THE ENGAGEMENT PROCESS.
04:13:40.767: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER GIBB-RANDALL.
04:13:41.802: >> Commissioner Gibb-Randall: I'M FEELING A LITTLE BRAIN FRIED. I DON'T HAVE A LOT TO SAY OTHER THAN I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR A LONG TIME TOO. II DEFINITELY WANT TO OFFICE DISTRICT FORWARD WITH IT. I WOULD BE CURIOUS TO KNOW. I KNOW SOME OTHER MACES HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR A WHILE AND I WOULD BE CURIOUS ABOUT THE HEIGHT LIMIT THING IN OTHER PLACES IN TERMS OF UNLIMITED VERSUS LIMITED, JUST TO KNOW HOW THAT'S BEING HANDLED IN DIFFERENT AREAS. SO IT WOULD BE A LITTLE MORE EXPLORATION OF COROLLARY CITIES AND PROGRAMS AND WHERE PEOPLE ARE FALLING WITH THE KIND OF AFFORDABILITY MANDATED OR OPPORTUNITIES FOR AFFORDABILITY IN RELATION TO HEIGHT OR WHETHER THERE'S UNLIMITED -- AND, AGAIN, LIKE I JUST THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, A BIG PART OF THE FOOTPRINT, LIKE ONCE YOU START INTRODUCING CARS ON TO IT, THEN THEY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO LOOP AROUND AND GET BACK OUT AND IT JUST TAKES A TAKES UP A HUGE AMF SPACE. I'M ALL FOR LET THE MARKET FIGURE IT OUT, BUT YOU CAN HAVE ZERO IF YOU WANT TO ALONG THESE TRANSIT CORRIDORS. I THINK IT'S GREAT AND THE NEIGHBORHOODS AROUND HERE ARE NOT REALLY NEIGHBORHOODS IN TERMS OF, YOU KNOW, YOU ARE TRYING TO PARK ALONG, YOU KNOW -- I DON'T KNOW, SOME OF THESE ACCESS ROADS DON'T EVEN HAVE STREET PARKING ON THEM ANYWAY. YOU WOULD BE PARKING THREE-QUARTER OF MILE AI WHAT. I DON'T THINK IT WILL HAPPEN. IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S RIGHT UP NEXT TO THE NEIGHBORHOODS IN TERMS OF THE LOW-HANGING FRUIT ONES THAT WE ARE TRYING TO FOR THIS TIME. SO I'M NOT THAT CONCERNED WITH THAT, AS FAR AS THE EXPERIMENTATION OF THREE DIFFERENT AREAS. I WOULD SAY FULL FORCE AHEAD. I'M ALL FOR IT. I WOULD LOVE TO MORE ENGAGEMENT TOO. I THINK IT'S GREAT. THIS IS A CHANGE AND I THINK DENSITY ALONG THESE MAKES SO MUCH SENSE. SO THAT'S WHERE I AM.
04:15:32.412: >> Chair Milshteyn: DO WE HAVE A MOTION TO EXTEND TO 11:25. MOVED BY COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN AND SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER SAUVE. 11:25. ALL THOSE IN FAVOR. [CHORUS OF AYES] COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT.
04:15:47.961: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: I ALSO FEEL VERY BRAIN DEAD. I DON'T KNOW HOW COHERENT THIS WILL BE. I THINK THIS IS INCREDIBLY EXCITING. I WISH PLYMOUTH WAS ON YOUR LIST. I JUST THINK IT SCREAMS FOR MORE DENSITY. I ALSO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THE UNLIMITED HEIGHT THAT I THINK WILL ADDRESS THROUGH SOME EXPLORATION. I KNOW THAT RIGHT NOW NONE OF THE AREAS REALLY BUFFER ANY EXISTING RESIDENTIAL AREA. THERE'S NOT MUCH, BUT I THINK THERE MIGHT BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT LIKE HOW THIS ZONE WILL INTERFACE OR CONNECT WITH SOME EXISTING RESIDENTIAL BECAUSE I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO DRAW PEOPLE FROM THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS TO THE IMPROVED DENSITY ALONG THE CORRIDOR WITHOUT HAVING TO GET INTO THEIR CAR AND DRIVE AROUND TO SOME OF THOSE HOPEFULLY AWESOME NEW USES THAT COME IN AND ALSO SUPPORT LOOKING AT, YOU KNOW, THE POTENTIAL OF PREMIUMS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND AGREE WITH EVERYTHING THAT YOU GUYS SAID ABOUT THE MASTER PLAN. I HAVE THINK WE SHOULDN'T DELAY. OKAY.
04:16:49.489: >> Chair Milshteyn: COMMISSIONER ABRONS.
04:16:51.224: >> Commissioner Abrons:  I ALSO SUPPORT FURTHER ENGAGEMENT AND I'M WONDERING WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE AND MAYBE STAFF COULD GIVE SOME IDEAS ABOUT WHAT THAT TIMELINE OR STEP FORWARD WOULD BE IF WE VOTE TO TABLE THIS EVENING.
04:17:07.574: >> WHAT I'M ENVISIONING IS WE HAVE GOTTEN A COUPLE OF AREAS OF DIRECTION AND SOME POTENTIAL AREAS OF FURTHER REFINEMENT OR COMPARABLES. SO WHAT I -- AT THIS POINT, WHAT I'M ENVISIONING IS GIVEN THAT WE HAVE -- WE HAVE HEARD A LOT OF CONCERN OVER THE LACK OF ENGAGEMENT BEYOND THIS PUBLIC HEARING, WHAT I WOULD ENVISION IS MAYBE A VERY SIMILAR PRESENTATION GOING FURTHER INTO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE RAISED AND I WOULD SIMPLY SCHEDULE THAT FOR AN UPCOMING WORKING SESSION OR REGULAR PLANNING COMMISSION AGENDA, THAT WE WOULD SORT OF DEDICATE THAT MEETING TO THE D DISCUSSION. WE WOULD REFINE THAT PRESENTATION WITH SOME OF THE ADDITIONAL RESEARCH THAT YOU HAVE DIRECTED US TO LOOK AT. WE WOULD -- THE TIMING OF THAT WOULD BE SUCH -- I DON'T WANT TO COMMIT TO A DATE TONIGHT, BUT WHAT I WOULD LOOK AT IS BOTH THE TIME THAT WE NEED TO PULL TOGETHER THAT RESEARCH. WE HAVE SOME OF IT, BUT I THINK I WOULD LIKE TO EXPLORE A LITTLE BIT MORE BASED ON SOME OF OUR COMMENTS AND THEN THAT WE CAN PROVIDE AN ADEQUATE AMOUNT OF LEAD TIME TO GET THE WORD OUT, BEYOND NOTIFICATION TO NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOC ASSOCIATIONSE COULD MAYBE BRAINSTORM ABOUT MAYBE SOME OF THE OTHER STAKEHOLDER ORGANIZATIONS THAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL TO REACH OUT TO AS WELL. SO IN SHORT, I WOULD SAY THAT MAYBE WE FIND A FUTURE PLANNING COMMISSION MEETING WHERE WE DEDICATE TO THIS AND WE -- AND SORT OF LEAVE IT OPEN IF WE WANTED TO SORT OF -- MY INSTINCT AT THIS POINT IS WHENEVER IT HAPPENS REALLY TREAT IT AS A WORKING SESSION SO IT REALLY IS TRULY ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY FOR FEEDBACK, REFINEMENT TO GIVE YOU THE CONFIDENCE THAT IT'S GETTING CLOSER TO A FINAL FORMAT BEFORE IT'S BACK UP FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.
04:18:55.182: >> Commissioner Abrons:  AND YOU PROBABLY HAVE THESE IN YOUR NOTES, BUT IVAN SPUR FOR FURTHER RESEARCH WOULD BE AFFORDABLE HOUSING MANDATE, RIGHT? HEIGHT LIMIT? LIKE, 40 YOU IS THAT PLAYING OUT IN OTHER LOCATIONS? I WOULD BE INTERESTED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE PARKING. AND REASSURANCES THAT IT IS NOT OFF-LOADING TO SURROUNDING NEIGHBORHOODS.
04:19:28.548: >> Chair Milshteyn: I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT PARKING IN THE REGARDS THAT DEPENDING ON THE USES, YOU KNOW, DEPENDING ON WHAT THE SITES ARE GOING TO BE USED FOR. AND WHAT MIXTURE OF THAT MAYBE NOT NECESSARILY BEING ZERO, BUT DEPENDING ON IF IT'S OFFICE USE, TYPES OF DIFFERENT COMMERCIAL USES, THAT THERE IS AT LEAST SOME MINIMAL PARKING. I KNOW THE MARK WILL DETERMINE BUT I -- I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MORE CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT DIRECTION AT THIS POINT TO GO. COMMISSIONER HAMMERSCHMIDT.
04:20:06.353: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: JUST A CLARIFYING QUESTION ABOUT IS THAT INTENDED TO BE PUBLIC OPEN SPACE OR ANY TYPE OF OPEN SPACE? SO IT COULD BE PRIVATE FOR RESIDENTS OF A DEVELOPMENT AND STILL MEET THAT REQUIREMENT?
04:20:17.764: >> IT WOULD BE THE -- MAKE SURE IT'S ON. IT WOULD BE THE SAME AS THE OTHER ZONING DISTRICTS. SO IT'S PRIVATE. IT'S NOT A PARK, BUT IT IS LITERALLY OPEN SPACE. IT'S NOT BUILDING FOOTPRINT. IT IS NOT PARKING OR DRIVEWAY. IT CAN BE HARD SURFACE. IT CAN BE IMPROVED OPEN SPACE, BUT IT IS -- IT'S NOT -- NO BUILDING, NO PARKING AND SO IT IS SORT OF A FORM-BASED THING.
04:20:47.594: >> Commissioner Hammerschmidt: OKAY. THEN I THINK I WOULD SUPPORT WHAT YOU WERE SAYING COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN ABOUT LOOKING AT PREMIUMS FOR GREEN SPACE. IT'S NOT JUST PRIVATE PLAZA-TYPE SPACE. COMMUNITY GATHERING SPACE, ALONG THE CORRIDORS.
04:21:04.311: >> Chair Milshteyn: FURTHER DISCUSSION? DO I HAVE A MOTION TO TABLE. MOVED BY COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN, SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER SAUVE. ALL THOSE IN FAVOR OF TABLING, PLEASE SAY AYE. [CHORUS OF AYES] OPPOSED? IT IS TABLED. MOVING ON TO AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION. IS THERE ANYONE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO WISHES TO ADDRESS THE PLANNING COMMISSION? DO I HAVE A COMMISSIONER THAT WILL MOVE TO TEXTEND UNTIL 11:40? MOVED BY COMMISSIONER ACKERMAN AND SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER SAUVE. ALL THOSE IN FAVOR, PLEASE SAY AYE. [CHORUS OF AYES] WE ARE EXTENDED TO 11:40. AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION. IS THERE ANYONE WHO WISHES TO TALK TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION. YOU HAVE UP TO THREE MINUTES? [ OFF MICROPHONE COMMENTS ]
04:21:56.463: >> WWHAT I DIDN'T GET TO IS AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IT'S LIKE AND I HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND AS A NEIGHBORHOOD REPRESENTATIVE. SO IMAGINE GETTING THE INFORMATION ABOUT THIS MEETING ON FRIDAY, ALL RIGHT? SO THEN THE QUESTION IS, FIRST OF ALL, UNDERSTANDING IT. NUMBER TWO IS GETTING IT OUT TO THE PEOPLE AND OUR ASSOCIATION. SO WE HAVE A BOARD. WE HAVE A BOARD OF 12 PEOPLE. SO IT'S NOT LIKE WE CAN JUST GET THIS INFORMATION AND SORT OF SEND IT ON FOR PEOPLE TO LOOK AT, AND READ AND, YOU KNOW, AND ALL OF THAT KIND OF STUFF. THERE NEEDS TO BE DISCUSSION AND THEN IF THERE ARE QUESTIONS TO GET BACK TO SOME CONTACT, YOU KNOW TO SORT OF DIGEST THE INFORMATION. AND THEN TO REFLECT AND THEN YOU SORT OF HAVE A DISCUSSION AND MAYBE TAKE A VOTE. IS THIS WHAT THE ORGANIZATION WANT MS. TO DO OR SHOULD WE, YOU KNOW, BE -- YOU KNOW, HAVE INDIVIDUAL KIND OF RESPONSES. SO IT'S NOT JUST A M MATTER OF BEING ABLE TO GET INFORMATION ON A FRIDAY AND RESPOND WITHIN TWO OR THREE DAYS. IT TAKES SOME TIME. THAT'S WHY I WAS SORT OF SUGGESTING WHAT WHEN THERE IS A STAFF REPORT, YOU GIVE A TWO-WEEK NOTICE. I MEAN, I THINK THAT'S REASONABLE. I DON'T I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHYIO BE THE FRIDAY BEFORE. AND THEN THE OTHER TIME FRAME PROBLEM IS FRIDAY AT 3:00. BRETT IS OFF THE WORK. HE'S GOING TO BE OFF FOR THE WEEKEND. SO IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS, YOU SEND IT OVER THE WEEKEND BUT THEN ON MONDAY, HE'S BUSY DOING ALL OTHER KINDS OF STUFF. SO BRETT KINDLY RESPONDED TO ME AT AC4: ARE 5:00 IN THE AFTERNOT THERE'S NOT MUCH TIME TO DIGEST AND PROVIDE FEEDBACK. I GUESS FROM A NEIGHBORHOOD PERSPECTIVE, I THINK TIME IS SORT OF CRITICAL IF YOU WANT THE INFORMATION TO BE SERIOUSLY ADDRESSED. THANK YOU.
04:23:46.639: >> Chair Milshteyn: THANK YOU.
04:23:59.219: >> KEN GARBER, 2723 HILL DALE. THANK YOU ALL
