IF YOU DO THAT PLEASE BE SURE TO TAG US AT #A2 VOTES. THOSE  WHO VOTED VIA ABSENTEE,--
00:05:09.461: >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE NOW COME TO PUBLIC COMMENT  RESERVE TIME. IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO FOR MEMBERS OF THE  PUBLIC TO SPEAK TO COUNCIL AND COMMUNITY ABOUT MATTER OF THE COMMUNITY INTEREST. ONE NEEDS TO HAVE SIGNED UP IN ADVANCE BY CONTACTING OUR CITY CLERK. SPEAKERS HAVE THREE MINUTES  IN WHICH TO SPEAK, PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE TIME CLOCK. AS A MATTER OF SURT C COURTESY WE MAY HAVE ONE PERSON SPEAK AT THE A TIME. OUR FIRST SPEAKER IS KEN GARBER. 
00:05:43.195: >> KEN GARBER:  KEN GARBER. I'M WITH CLIMATE MOBILIZATION. WE LOVE THIS CARBON NEUTRALITY RESOLUTO N FOR ALL KINDS OF  REASONS. BUT THERE'S ONE THING WE TAKE ISSUE WITH. AND THAT'S THE TARGET FOR ACHIEVIN G CITYWIDE CARBON NEUTRALITY. IT'S 2035 IN THIS PROPOSAL. WE THINK THAT'S TOO FAR OUT.  LAST YEAR THE IPCC CAME OUT WITH A REPORT THAT SAYS WE TO  LIMIT GLOBAL HEATING TO AVOID WORSE IMPACTS. MANY PEOPLE  CITE THIS REPORT THAT IF WE CUT EMISS EMISSIONS HALF IN ELEVEN  YEARS BY 2030 AND COMPLETELY BY 2050, WE CAN DO THIS. HERE'S A REPRESENTATION OF THAT. YOU'VE GOT TIME ON THE X AXIS. AND YOU'VE GOT CO2 ON THE Y AXIS. AND LOOKING AT THIS, YOU HAVE TO THINK OF OUR GLOBAL  CARBON BUDGET AS THE AREA UNDER THE CURVE.  NOW LOOKING AT THIS ANNE ARBOR', THE PROPOSAL YOU'RE VOTING ON TONIGHT, WEE LOOK GOOD. 2035. WE'RE 15 YEARS AHEAD OF  THE DEADLINE IN REACHING CARBON NEUTRALITY. NOT SO P FAST. IF YOU READ THE REPORT, IT SAYS THAT, 2050 GIVES YOU A 50%  CHANCE OF REACHING 1. 5-DEGREES CELSIUS. IF YOU WANT A 67%  CHANCE YOU HAVE TO CUT YOUR BUDGET BY A THIRD. NOW YOU'RE  LOOKING AT 2040. THE IPCC ALSO DOES NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT  FEEDBACKS, LIKE THE MELTING OF FROST, WITH THE RELEASE OF  METHANE WHICH CAUSES MORE METHANE RELEASE WHICH IS A  [INAUDIBLE. WE NEED TO AVOID THAT. TO DO THAT YOU NEED TO CUT YOUR  CARBON BUDGET FURTHER. NOW WE'RE DOWN TO 2045. IPCC ASS ASSUMES THE WIDESPREA D USE OF CARBON IN TECHNOLOGIES, MACHINES THAT SUCK CO2 FROM THE ATMOSPHR E. LIQUEFY AND  INJECT IT UNDERGRON D. WE CAN'T ASSUME WE CAN USE THAT MUCH SCALE. CUT THE BUDGET SOME MORE. FINALLY THE IPCC MODELS DON'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE  PRINCIPLE OF GLOBAL EQUITY AND JUSTICE. WHICH RICH COU COUNTRIES, THAT HAVE BENEFIT FROM THOSE EMISSIONS MUST CUT  FIRST ALLOWING POOR COUNTRIES TO CATCH UP IN DEVELOPMENT WITH THEIR CARBON BUDGET.  SO NOW WE'RE DOWN TO REALLY 2025. AND  OUR 2035 TARGET  DOESN'T REALLY CUT IT FOR 1. 5-DEGREE CELSIUS. MY DISCUSSIO SUGGESTION TO YOU IS BRIDGE IT DOWN TO 2030. I HAVE PETITIONS WITH 577  CITY RESIDENTS ENCOURSING A 2025 TARGET. I'D LIKE TO GIVE  IT TO THE CITY NOW. 
00:08:56.288: >> THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS MILT BAKER. 
00:09:00.292: >> THANK YOU. MY NAME IS MILT BAKER. AND I'M COMING HERE  IN SUPPORT OF THE CLIMATE NEUTRALITY RESOLUTO N. I APPLAUD  THE CITY COUNCIL FOR PUTTING THIS TOGETHER. I APP APPLAUD MISSY  STOLES FOR HER LEADERSHP . I * I'D LIKE TO MAKE A COMMENT FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.  I WOULD LIKE TO SEE  A MORE AGGRESSIVE DEADLINE SET THAN 20 2035. I'M COMING FROM A DIFFERENT PERSPET IVE. SETTING  REACH OUT GOALS CAN REACH SPECTACULAR RESULTS. AND I'VE  SEEN THIS IN MY BUSINESS CAREER WHERE I WORKED FOR AN  ELECTRONICS COMPANY, COMPETING WITH THE JAPANESE IN THE 80S  AND 90S. AND OUR CEO DIDN'T TALK ABOUT IMPROVING QUALITY 10 OR 20%. HE CAME UP WITH A GOAL OF 1,000 TIMES IN FIVE YE YEARS. OF COURSE ALL THE NAYSAYERS CAME OUT AND SAID CAN'T BE DONE. I'M SURE WHAT YOU'RE HEARING ABOUT THE CLIMATE RESOLUTION. IT TURNS OUT THAT KIND OF THINKING FORCES YOU TO THINK  DIFFERENTLY. WHEN YOU THINK DIFFERENTLY YOU CAN COME UP  WITH INCREDIBLY GOOD SOLUTIONS. BY THE WAY A LOT OF THEM WILL TELL YOU IT'S W WAY TOO EXPENSIVE. IN THE MANUFACTURING  ARENA WE LEARNED THE HIG HIGHEST QUALITY TURNED OUT TO BE THE  LOWEST COAST.  THE LOWER THE CO2 THE LOWER THE COST. SO I SUPPORT BRINGING  IT INTO MORE LIKE THE 2030 TIMEFRAME JUST LIKE THE LAST  SPEAKER SAID.  AND I THINK ONE OF THE MOST DEMONSTRATABLE AREAS THAT THIS  HAS PROVEN OUT IS, MANY OF YOU MAY NOT REMEMBER, IN 1962,  PRESIDENT KENNEDY SAID WE WILL PUT A MAN IN THE MOON BY THE END OF THE DECADE. IN 1962, WE COULDN'T LAUNCH A ROCKET. BUT WE PUT A PERSON IN THE MOON BY THE END OF THE DECADE. ANOTHER THING COUPLING TODAY IS IT HELPS DRIVE WHERE WE ARE TODAY. SO WE CAN LINE OURSELVES UP WITH WHERE WE WANT TO B BE, AND YOU KNOW, 2035 OR 2040 IS MORE LIKE 16 YEARS AWAY, AND THAT'S A PRETTY FAR AWAY TO BE.  SO AGAIN, I THINK THERE'S A LOT THAT CAN BE SAID FOR SETTING AN AGGRESSIVE GOAL AND LETTING PEOPLE WORK TOWARD THAT GOAL. AND AGAIN, I APPLAUD THE CITY COUNCIL FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP IN  THIS AREA. I HOPE YOU PASS THIS RESOLUTION. AND I  APPRECIATE YOU GIVING ME THE TIME TO WEIGH IN ON MY OPINION. THANK YOU. 
00:11:25.971: >> THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS CARE LINE STARK. CAROLINE STARK.
00:11:33.111: >> CAROLINE STARK:  HELLO, I'M CAROLINE STARK. 406, LINDA  VISTA STREET. I LIVED IN ANNE ARBOR 44 YEARS AND MEMBER OF  ANNE ARBOR INDIVISIL E WHICH SUPPORTS THE REZ ON CLIMATE NEUTRALITY.  I HAVE TEN GRANDCHILDREN. AND I ADORE THEM. AND I'M VERY  WORRIED ABOUT THEIR FUTURE. SCIENTISTS TELL US THAT WE HAVE  ONLY TEN YEARS LEFT TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE GREENHU SE GAS  EMISSIONS. AFTER THAT, THE EFFECTS OF GLOBAL WARMING WILL  BE IRREVERSIBLE. WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE  CHANGE AS MORE COMMUNITIES HAVE DROUGHTS, FLOODS, WILDFIRES,  AND CROP DISRUPTIONS. IT HAS BEEN FRUSTRATING TO ME TO SEE LITTLE ACTION TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES NATIONALLY, STATEWIDE  OR LOCALLY. TAKING ACTION IS DIFFICULT. PEOPLE DON'T LIKE CHANGE. I'M  SURE MEMBERS OF CITY COUNCIL HAVE BEEN COUNTERED RESISTANCE  WHEN ASKED TO MAKE CHANGES THAT COST THEM MORE MONEY OR  INCONVENIENCE THEM. SOME OF US MAY AVOID DEALING WITH THE  THREATS POSED BY CLIMATE CHANGE ALTOGETHER, DENIAL IS A  WONDERFUL THING.  IT MAY BE THOUGH THAT WE'RE ALL GOING THROUGH COULD BE  LETTER ROSS STAGES OF GRIEF, SHOCK, DENIAL, ANGER,  BARGAINING, DEPRESSION, TESTING, ACCEPTANCE AS WE BECOME  AWARE OF WHAT WE HAVE TO GIVE UP IN ORDER TO SOLVE THE PATR  PROBLEMS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. IT'S EXPECT 9-- AS WE'RE FA FACEEDWITH UNCER UNCERTAINTY AND LOSS BUT THIS IS A DEFINING  MOMENT FOR US. WE WANT TO HAVE AN ANSWER TO OUR CHILDREN  AND GRANDCHILDREN IN THE FUTURE WHEN THEY ASK US, WHAT DID  YOU DO TO HELP STOP CLIMATE CHANGE? TO STOP THE CLIMATE  CRISIS? WE CAN DO THIS. THE MOST CRITICAL ACTION WE CAN  TAKE IS TO SUPPORT LEADERS WHO HAVE A PLAN FOR STOPPING CLIMATE CHANGE.  TODAY WE HAVE A RESOLUTION ON CARBON NEUTRALITY AND A PLAN  TO BEGIN TAKING ACTION IN ANNE ARBOR. WE ASK THAT THE CITY  COUNCIL SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION. ALSO WE ASK THAT THE  COMMUNITY SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION AND SUPPORT OUR LEADERS WHO WILL BE COMMUNICATING THIS PLAN TO OUR FELLOW CITIZENS  AND IMPLEMENTING IT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
00:14:07.899: >> THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS IAN PEARSALL. 
00:14:11.970: >> IAN PERCENT PEARSALL: I'M THE CO-CHAIR MUCH THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST ECHO ASSOCIATIST COMMUNITY. MOST OF HERE TONIGHT  AND EVERYONE IN FRONT OF ME IS AWARE OF THE STAKES OF THE  CL  CLIMATE CRISIS. WE HAVE SEEN INCREASED PRECIPITATO N, ET  CETERA. THE ISSUE AT PRESENT FOR OUR CITY IS NOT WHETHER WE  NEED TO ADDRESS GLOBAL WARMING BUT HOW. COUNCILMEMBER HAVE STATED THE OPERATIONS OF THE CITY ACCOUNT  FOR NET CARBON EMISSIONS OF THE CITY. SO THE 2025 DEADLINE  FOR THE CITY PALES . I ESTIMATE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO PUSH  THE DEADLINE FOR TOTAL NEUTRALITY EARLIER. BUT IDEALLY TO  2025, 2030, AS KEN SAID, AGREEABLE.  BOTH OF THESE DEADLINES MUST BE ACCOMPLISHED IF WE ARE GOING  TO SURVIVE. AND I THINK THIS RESOLUTION WILL SUPPORT TOUGH  LEGISLATIVE DECISIONS THAT YOU NEED TO MAKE LATER ON DOWN  THE LINE, ALTHOUGH IT DOES NOT SET ANY FIRM POLICIES.  I'M NOT H HERE TO ASK FOR A PURITY TEST. I DON'T CARE HOW  MUCH YOU RECYCLE OR HOW EFFICIENT ARE COW HOUSES. I CARE ABOUT  THE POMS YOU PUT FORWARD AND SUPPORTING THE RESOLUTION'S GOALS. ANY POLICY PROPOSALS TO BRING US TO CARBON  NEUTRALITY, MUST BE SECTIONAL.  WE NEED TO THINK OF SYSTEMIC SOLUTIONS TO THIS PROBLEM OF  THE CLIMATE CRISIS. WE MUST APPROACH IT AS A COMMUNT Y, NOT  AS INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS BECAUSE WE ARE MOST POWERFUL AS AN ORG ORGANIZED COMMUNITY. TO WORK IN LINE WITH THE LANGUAGE OF THE RESOLUTION. SOME IDEAS FOR LOW HANGING FRUIT POLICIES TO MAKE IN THE FUTURE WOULD BE EXPANDED AND FREE PUBLIC  TRANSPORTATIO. I THINK THE FAIRS ACCOUNT FOR 20% OF THE  BUDGET OF OUR PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. SO MOVING TO A FAIR  FREE PUBLIC TRANSIT WILL ENCOURAGE LESS CARBON EMISSIONS, LESS COMMUNICATING VIA SINGLE OCCUPANCY VEHICLES.  PUBLICLY OWN AND OED AND OPERATED POWER GRID. THE STATE OF  NEBRASKA DOES IT. ENCOURAGING THE REWILDING OF YARDS,  REDUCING REGULATIONS ON HOW PEOPLE POLICE THEIR YARDS AND OFFICE PARKS AS WELL. GETTING RID OF GOLF COURSES. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S LOW HANGING FRUIT FOR YOU. IT'S FOR ME.  COMPLICATED CHALLENGES, -- AND ANY COHOUSING IS IDEALLY MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY EFFI EFFICIENT IN SINGLE FAMILY HOMES AND GETTING  LARGE CORPORATIONS IN THE COMMUNITY INCLUDING THE UNIVERSITY TO PAY PROPERTY TAXES. THANK YOU.
00:17:16.788: >> [APPLAUSE]
00:17:18.890: >> OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS LARRY JUNCK.
00:17:20.725: >> LARRY JUNCK:  I'M A PROFESSOR IN THE UNIVERSITY OF  MICHIGAN MEA MEDICAL SCHOOL. AND I T CONSIDER CLIMATE CHANGE AS  ONE OF MY EXPERTISE. THREE PIECES OF BACKGROUND INFORMATION RELEVANT TO MY COMMENTS TONIGHT, FIRST, IN 2015, THE PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD LIMITING CLIMATE CHANGE BY 2-DEGREES CELSIUS,  3. 6F. AND ASPIRATIONAL GOAL OF 1. 5. THE 1. 5-DEGREEDEGREE GOAL  WAS SET FOR PACIFIC ISLAND NATIONS WHAT COULD BE INHABITAL E AT 2-DEGREE RISE IN TEST TEMPERATURE. AS AN ASIDE. PRESIDENT TRUMP WITHDREW THE U. S. FROM THE  CLIMATE ACCORD. SECOND MUCH THE 1. 5 TO 2-DEGREE GOALS, WE  ALREADY REACHED 1 DEGREE CELSIUS. IF PEOPLE OF THE WORLD  DON'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE, IT'S PROJECTED TO  USE 4 ABOUT THE 1 TO 4. 8-DEGREE CELSIUS. WITH THAT CLIMATE,  IT WILL BE LIKE THE CLIMATE OF OKLAHOMA HERE IN ANNE ARBOR. IN THE FALL OF 2018, THE UN'S IPCCS H AS MENTIONED BY OTHERS  SET THE GOAL OF REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS  EMISSIONS BY MORE THAN 50%, 2030. TEN AND A HALF YEARS FROM NOW. ON MY HAND  IS A MAGAZINE FOR SERIOUS SCIENCE.  IT ADDRESSES THE QUESTION, WHAT ARE THE CONSEQUENCES OF  LIMITING CLIMATE CHANGE TO 1. 5 RATHER THAN 2-DEGREES CEL CELSIUS. IT WAS WRITTEN BY AN EXPERT GROUP OF THE IN INTERNATIONAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE. AMONG ITS MAJOR  CONCLUSIONS, EACH 0. 5-DEGREE INCREASE WILL INVOLVE INC     T INCREMENTAL RISK. IT IS ON TOP OF THE FACT THAT THE 0. 5  INCREASES ARE HAPPENING FASTER AND FASTER. THE RISKS ARE ACCELERATING.  THE RISK RISKS IN QUESTION INCLUDING MORE KILLING HEAT WAVES, EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS, WILD FIRES, COASTAL INNUN DAZE BY  RISING OCEAN. LOSS OF SPECIES, REDUCED CROP FIELDS AND EFFECTS ON HUMAN HEALTH.  RESTRAINING GLOBAL TEMPERATURE TO 1. 5-DEGREES C, QUOTING  THEIR REPORT ABOVE THE PREINDUSTRIAL PERIOD WILL BE LESS  COSTLY BY A FACTOR OF FOUR TO FIVE RATHER THAN INACTION OF  GLOBAL CHANGE.  WE HAVE A CLIMATE EMERGENCY. EVERY COMMUNITY AND EVERY  GOVERNMENT ENTITY SHOULD BE CONSIDERED WHAT TO DO TO ADDRESS  CLIMATE CHANGE. IN SUMMARY, CLIMATE CHANGE IS AN EMERGENCY, SECOND, NOW IS THE TIME TO ACT ON IT. THIRD, ANNE ARBOR  SHOULD BE A LEADER AMONG COMMUNITIES IN DOING SO. I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THE RESOLUTION AND TO MAKE IT AS STRONG AS POSSIBLE.
00:20:34.118: >> THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SP SPEAK C SPEAKER IS GUS TESCHKE.
00:20:42.360: >> I'LL IS PASS. 
00:20:44.228: >> OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS BLAINE COAL COLE MAN. 
00:20:49.067: >> YOU'VE GOT A GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE RESOLUTION BEFORE YOU  TONIGHT WHICH IS SI GOOD ONE. IT'S A GOOD ONE BECAUSE IT *  SETS AN EXAMPLE FOR THE WORLD. IT TEMPERATURES THE WORLD YOU NEED TO DO THE SAME THING ANNE ARBOR IS DOING WHICH IS  TO SPEAK STRONGLY AGAINST AND ACT STRONGLY AGAINST CAR CARBON-BASED POLLUTION. NOW, ALL BY ITSELF, ANNE ARBOR IS NOT GOING TO EVEN MAKE A DENT IN GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE. BUT THIS RESOLUTION SETS AN  EXCELLENT EXAMPLE FOR THE WORLD. AND THAT'S WHY, THAT'S WHY  YOU DO GLOBAL RESOLUTIONS. YOU DO GLOBAL RESOLUTIONS TO SET  AN EXAMPLE FOR THE WORLD AND STOP A WORLDWIDE PROBLEM.  NOW THE RESOLUTION WE HAVE BEEN SUPPORTING FOR 17 YEARS IN  THE CITY COUNCIL SAYS, 7 LEGAL WORLDS, WE ARE AGAINST MILITARY AID TO ISRAEL. WE'VE DEMANDED THIS. WE'VE  DEMANDED BOYCOTT AGAINST ISRAEL. WE DEMANDED DIVESTMENT-- ACTION BY IN C CITY COUNCIL AGAINST ISRAEL BECAUSE THIS CITY COUNCIL CONTROLS ISRAEL? NO, NO. THIS CITY COUNCIL CAN AND WILL SET AN EXAMPLE GLOBALLY. IT'S A GLOBAL RESOLUTION AND TEND TO SET A GLOBAL EXAMPLE  JUST LIKE YOUR GLOBAL CLIMATE RESOLUTION. THIS RESOLUTION,  LET ME REPEAT IT, WE ARE AGAINST MILITARY AID TO ISRAEL. COMBATS, THE PHENOMENON OF ISRAEL MASSACRING THOUSANDS OF PALESTINIANS. IT COMBATS THE PHENOMENON OF THE UNITED  STATES JOULE MANYING JUDGMENTI JUDGM JUD JUMPING ONBOARD. IT COMBATS WHAT ISRAEL IS DOING  WHICH IS ACTING AS THE PRIM PRIMARY ENGINE OF MURDER AGAINST AR ARABS.  THE PRIMARY ENGINE OF MURDER AGAINST MUSLIMS WORLDWIDE. ISRAEL BY ITS ACTIONS TELLS THE WORLD THAT IT'S OKAY TO KEEP  MASSACRING MUSCLE LITTLES, ARABS. AND MOST ACUTELY, PALESTINIANS. SO IS IT ASKING TOO MUCH TO TELL THE U. S. GOVERNMENT WITH THIS RESOLUTION WE ARE AGAINST MILITARY AID  TO ISRAEL. I DON'T THINK IT'S ASKING TOO MUCH.  AND I HOPE, AFTER 17 YEARS, THE CITY COUNCIL WILL STEP UP  FOR THIS GLOBAL RESOLUTION AGAINST MILITARY AID TO ISRAEL  AND SET AN EXAMPLE FORMAT U. S. CONGRESS, SET AN EXAMPLE FOR THE WORLD JUST AS IT'S DOING WITH THE ENVIRONMENT 58 GLOBAL RESOLUTION TONIGHT. THANK YOU. 
00:23:49.347: >> THANK YOU. ARE THERE COMMUNICATIONS FROM COUNCIL? COUNCIL GRISWOLD?
00:23:53.484: >> I HAVE THREE THINGS. THE FIRST ONE IS A RESOLUTION THAT I'M STARTING TO WORK ON ABOUT IMPROVING COMMUNICATIONS. AND  WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT THAT IS THAT WE NEED TO BE MORE TRANSPARENT. WE NEED TO BE MORE COLLABORATTIV E HE IS SPECIAL  LITTLE AS A COUNCIL BECAUSE INDIVIDUAL COUNCILMEMBR S REALLY  HAVE NO POWER. IT'S THROUGH OUR JOINT EFFORT AND RESO     N RESOLUTIONS THAT WE CAN INFLUENCE POLICY IN THE CITY.  AND THE THIRD ONE IS ACCURACY. WE READ ABOUT FAKE NEWS AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL. BUT I THINK THAT WE NEED TO BE  PROACTIVE AND FOCUS ON WHAT INFORMATION IS OUT THERE IN THE  PUBLIC RECORD AND MAKE SURE IT'S ACCURATE, AND IF IT ISN'T,  TAKE THE CORRECTIVE ACTION TO CREATE ACCURATE INFORMATION. AND I'M NOT GOING TO GO INTO THE DETAILS OF THIS RESOLUTION. BUT I AM WORKING WITH CITY STAFF. I'LL HAVE A DRAFT TO THE  ADMINISTRATION COMMITTE NEXT WEEK AND HOPEFULLY A RESOLUTION AT THE NEXT COUNCIL MEETING.  NUMBER TWO, COUNCIL ENDORSED A BILL FOR A STATE CROSSWALK  LAW. I'LL BE BRINGING A RESOLUTION AT THE NEXT MEETING FOR  TIE ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS. THE FIRST ONE IS TO ADD THE WHITE CANE LAW. THIS IS LANGUAGE FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE VISION  IMPAIRMENT.  AND IT'S ALREADY IN THE UNIFORM TRAFFIC CODE WHICH IS  LANGUAGE THAT WAS DEVELOPED BY THE STATE POLICE FOR LOCAL  COMMUNITIES TO ADOPT. I BELIEVE IT'S VERY IMPORTANT AND  SHOULD BE IN OUR STATE LAW. AND IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TA TAKING THE EXACT LANGUAGE THAT'S IN THE UNIFORM, TRAFFIC CODE AND ADOPTING IT AS STATE LAW. AND THE THIRD ONE IS  THERE'S LANGUAGE RIGHT NOW ADDRESSING PERSONS WITH MOBILITY  CHALLENGES AT CROSSWALKS. I THINK THAT THAT NEEDS TO BE  REINFORCED. AND ANY TRAINING PACKAGE REGARDN G THE STATE  CROSSWALK LAW ONCE IT IS ADOPTED NEEDS TO ADDRESS PERSONALS WITH MOBILITY CHALLENGES, AND VISION CHALLENGES.  AND THE THIRD THING I JUST HAVE A FEW ITEMS THAT I WOULD  LIKE CLARIFIED PRIOR TOTS BUD TO THE BUDGET, STARTING IN DECEMBER.  THE FIRST ONE IS LIGHTING AT CROSSWALKS. WE PUT IN  CROSSWALKS RECENTLY EITHER WITHOUT LIGHTING OR WITHOUT POSITIVE CONTRAST LIGHTING. SO I LIKE TO KNOW WHAT IT WILL  TAKE TO BRING ALL OF OUR CROSSWALKS UP TO EXCELLENT STANDARDS, NOT JUST MINIMUM STANDARDS. WE NEED TO HAVE  POSITIVE CONTRAST LIGHTING.  AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT STATUTE DOESN'T FEEL LIKE WE  CAN'T AFFORD IT HERE IN ANNE ARBOR. WE NEED TO KNOW HOW  MUCH IT IS. AND COUNCIL NEEDS TO DECIDE. 
00:27:11.782: >> COUNCIL, THAT'S THREE MINUTE.
00:27:12.983: >> THANK YOU. 
00:27:14.618: >> F FURTHER COMMUNICATION FROM COUNCIL? 
00:27:18.255: >> COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER. 
00:27:19.657: >> I HAVE TWO QUICK ANNOUNCEMENS . I WANT TO FOLLOW ONTO  OUR RESIDENTIAL PARKING PERMIT. MR. LAZARUS AND I WILL BE  MEETING WITH A FEW INTERNAL MEMBERS WELCOME TO JOIN US ON  WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON TO DISCUSS OUR RESIDENTIAL PARKING  PERMITS AND SITUATION CITYWIDE. SO I'LL HAVE A FOLLOW-UP ANNOUNE MENT FOR YOU ALL ON  NOVEMBER 18. WE MIGHT NOT HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS BUT WE'LL  HAVE FURTHER ANNOUNCEMET S ABOUT THAT. AND THEN MY SECOND  ANNOUNCEMN T IS JUST TO UNDERLINE TO EVERYOE IS INVITED TO  JOIN US THIS WEDNESDAY NIGHT AT THE DOWNTOWN LIB LIBRARY ON THE  FOURTH FLOOR FOR THE CENTER OF THE CITY COMMONS AREA OPEN  HOUSE WHICH WILL BE FROM 6#T TO 8#T PM. AND I'M SURE MANY  OF US WILL TH BE THERE FOR THE GREAT DISCUSSO N ABOUT WHAT WE'D  LIKE TO SEE ON THE CENTER OF THE CITY THERE BY THE LIBRARY LOT. 
00:28:17.047: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER. 
00:28:18.249: >> THANK YOU. *. THANK YOU, MS. BANNISTER FOR MENTIONING  THE CENTER CITY PUBLIC MEETING. IT'S THE FIRST OF TWO  PUBLIC MEETINGS. THERE'S A TALK OF A THIRD BEFORE FEBRUARY  WHERE WE HAVE A LISTENING SESSION WHERE WE'LL SIT THERE LIKE  WE DO AT SOME OF THESE OTHER MEETINGS. HAVE EVERYBODY HAVE THEIR THREE MINUTES.  I'M EXCITED TO GO INTO THESE PUBLIC HEARINGS AND TO BE  HAPPENING. TWO MORE EVENTS TOMORROW, TOMORROW MORNING, AT  10AM IS THE QUARTERLY CARD MEETING. IT'S MDQ-EAGLE QUARTER  REPORT. AND THAT HAPPENS AT 10AM AT WASHINT ON CENTER FOR  DISEASE CONTROL ON D ZEEB ROAD. WE'RE WORKING HARD TO GET  THAT TAKEN CARED OF TOMORROW IS ELECTION DAY, SCHOOLS ARE  CLOSE. THERE'S A BILLION DOLLARS SCHOOL BOND ASK ON THERE. I URGE EVERYONE TO GO OUT AND LOOK AT THAT AND EXERCISE YOUR  RIGHT TO VOTE. A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE WI BEEN REACHING OUT ABOUT THAT ISSUE. IT'S A BIG ASK. PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE STATE OF OUR SCHOOLS. I THINK WE HAVE GREAT SCHOOLS. AND  PEOPLE THINK, HOW CAN YOU HAVE GREAT SCHOOLS AND STILL NEED  A BILLION DOLLARS.  I CAN'T ANSWER THAT QUESTION. I URGE YOU TO LOOK CLOSELY  HIGHWAY THE HOW THE MONEY IS GOING TO BE SPENT. IT STRETCHES THE  BONDING CAPACITY OF THE INDIVIDUAL, I THINK IN SOME CA CASE. THE COMMUNITY REQUE CAN ONLY FOOT THE BILL FOR SO MUCH. I URGE  YOU TO AND IT. THANK YOU. 
00:30:08.459: >> FURTHER COMMUNICATION FROM COUNCIL? I'D LIKE TO  RECOMMEND THE FOLLOWING NOMINATIONS FOR YOUR CONSIDERAI ON ON DISABILITY ISSUES. ALEX TO THE ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS. CHRIS --
00:30:21.472: >> WE NOW HAVE BEFORE US THE CONSENT AGENDA. MAY I HAVE  MOTION TO APPROVE THE AGENDA? DISCUSSION OF THE AGENDA.
00:30:33.017: >> I DON'T WISH TO PULL ANYTHIN, I JUST WANTED AS COUNCIL REPRESENTATIVE TO BOTH THE GREENBELT AND THE PARK ADVISORY--  CA2 AND  CA 3, THEY'RE RESPONSIVE TO SOME CONCERNS. CA 2,  THE CITY IS MAKING A CONTRIBUTION OF 16. 6% OF THE PURCHASE  PRICE AND THAT'S HELP LEVERAGING 114-ACRE S IN ANNE ARBOR  TOWNSHIP. SO I'M EXCITED TO SEE THAT.  IN ADDITION,  CA 3 IS BRINGING FOR PART THE PURCHASE OF FIVE AC ACRES THAT ARE ADJACENT TO LESLIE PARK GOLF COURSE AND HAS  340 FEET OF TROVER FRONTAGE, SUPPORT THE EFFORTS THERE TO  MAKE SURE WE'RE TAKING CARE OF THAT CREEK SHED AND OUR WATER QUALITY AND CITY. I THINK THAT, THIS IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF HOW THE PARK ADVISORY COMMISSION IS BEING JUDICIOUS AND  USING IMPORTANT METRICS BEFORE THEY MAKE ANY INVESTMENS BECAUSE WE HAVE TO MAINTAIN THAT LAND WITHIN OUR PARKS  BUDGET.  BUT THE PARK VIEMPLESRY COMMISSO N AND LAND ACQUISITION IS SUPPORTIVE WITH THAT GREENBELT LAND ACQUISITION MONEY WITHIN  THE CITY. I THINK THIS IS A TERRIFIC EXAMPLE OF A  RELATIVELY SMALL CONTRIBUTION OF $180,000 ALLOWING US TO GET  SOME SIGNIFICANT, YOU KNOW, CREEK FRONTAGE AND ACRES NEXT TO  AN EXISTING PARK. 
00:32:09.380: >> COUNCIL LUMM. 
00:32:10.381: >> ON THAT NOTE, I WASN'T GOING TO SAY ANYTHING. I WOULD  SAY TO BOTH CA 2, THAT'S THE CONSERVATION ALLEGATIONMENT IN  ANNE ARBOR TOW TOWNSHIP . AND COUNCILMEMBER GRAND IS RIGHT. THERE'S GREAT LEVERAGE HERE. I APPRECIATE WE'RE  CONTRIBUTING 17% FEDERAL GRANTS PAYING FOR 50%, THE COUNTY 17, AND ANNE ARBOR TOWNSHIP, ANOTHER 17%, AND THE FUNDING IS  1. 12 MILLION. THAT'S 114-ACRES. YEAH, IT'S, I APPRECIATE THE LEVERAGE.  AND CA 3, THAT ONE'S IN THE CITY WHICH IS EXCELLENT. AND AS  DESCRIBED BY COUNCILMEMBER GRAND, IT INCLUDES UP LANDS AND  WET LANDS ADJACET TO THE LESLIE PARK GOLF CARS AND TROVER  CREEK AREA. AND ANOTHER GOOD PURCHASE. THANKS FOR THE FO FOLKS WHO WORKED ON THIS AND THE PARK ADVISORY COMMISSION. 
00:33:14.211: >> COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
00:33:15.479: >> CAN YOU PULL CA 16 NOW? 
00:33:19.116: >>
00:33:20.984: >> CA 16. COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
00:33:24.154: >> I'D LIKE TO PULL CA 10. 
00:33:27.257: >> CA 10. COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER.
00:33:29.760: >> I'D LIKE TO PULL CA 7 AND CA 11.
00:33:34.331: >> FIRST DISCUSSION CONSENT AGENDA? ALL IN FAVOR? 
00:33:39.803: >> [CHORUS OF AYES]. 
00:33:41.305: >> THE CONSENT AGENDA WITH EXCEPTION OF 16, 10, 11-- ALL  VOTE IN THE AFFIRMATIVE, SATISFYING THE EIGHT VOTE  REQUIREMENT WITH RESPECT TO CA 2, CA 3. CA 16, RESOLUTION  TO APPROVE A CONST CONSTRUCT ION-- NORTH OF THE HIGH LEVEL TRUNK LINE, SAN TRI-- MOVE BY COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI. 
00:34:14.805: >> THANK YOU. AND THANKS FOR STAFF FOR BEING HERE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. I APPRECIATE COUNCILMEMBER LUMM'S AGENDA  QUESTION REGARDING THE LOW BID AND THE ENGINEERS' ESTIMATS AND WHAT THIS PROCEDURE WOULD COST. AND THE RESPONSE WAS THAT THE DIFFERENCE MOSTLY IS IN THE  LINING MATERIAL THAT'S GOING TO BE USED IN THE ORDERS THAT  ARE ADMITTED.  IT SEEMS LIKE A SIGNIFICANTLY LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY, IF  EVERYTHING ELSE IS THE SAME TO PAY THAT KIND OF MONEY TO  DEAL WITH THE ORDER. SO I HAVE QUESTIONS ON THAT, IF I COULD. HOW LONG WOULD THAT ORDER PERSIST? AND HAVE WE N USED THIS PRODUCT BEFORE? AGAIN, $679,000, I CAN PUT IT IN  PERSPECTIVE. SIX MONTHS AGO, WE WENT BACK AND FORTHWITH THE  TRANSPORTATION STUDY FOR THE NORTH SIDE. AND THAT'S WHAT  THE WHOLE STUDY COST. THIS SEEMS SIGNIFICANT. IF YOU CAN  SHED MORE LIGHT ON THAT. 
00:35:26.143: >> THE ORDER IS-- FIRST OF ALL, STYRENE IS NOT A NICE  PRODUCT, NICE CHEMICAL. THE ODOR IS PERSISTENT. THE LAST TIME WE DID LINING WITH S STYRENE ACTUALLY, THE COUNTY -- DID THAT IN THE PARK. WE WERE FIELDING COMPLAINTS FOR A  CONSIDERABLE LENGTH OF TIME AS DID J OUTGASSED-- AND CURED.
00:35:58.875: >> DAYS AND WEEKS?
00:35:59.543: >> MORE THAN DAYS. I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS LONGER THAN A  WEEK. UH, BUT IT WAS PERSISTENT. AND THIS WILL BE IN THE,  IN AN AREA WITH RESIDENTS. IT IS THE DIRECTION THAT WE  BELIEVE THE INDUSTRY IS GOING IN, THE USE OF STYRENE-FREE PRODUCT. AND WE ARE LEADING THE INDUSTRY THAT WAY. 
00:36:25.769: >> AND HOW MUCH TOTAL PIPE ARE WE RELINING? 
00:36:29.840: >> WE'LL LOOK AT IT REAL QUICK HERE FOR YOU.
00:36:34.344: >> THANKS. AND WHEN YOU SAY, WHAT PARTS OF THE DOWNTOWN ARE BEING DONE? I APOLOGIZE FOR NOT KNOWING THAT. 
00:36:41.585: >> UM, RIGHT OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD, I WANT TO SAY, IT IS IN THE-- IT'S JUST SHY OF A MILE, 4,800 FEET. AND IT'S IN THE  WILLIAM FIRST, AND EXTENDED THE RAILROAD TRACKS IN SOUTH ASHLEY, MADISON, SOUTH FIFTH. SO IT'S A FAIRLY EXTENSIVE AREA. 
00:37:09.379: >> AND WHAT TIMEFRAME W WHETHER IT BE DONE IN
00:37:15.319: >> WE DON'T HAVE A M SCHEDULE YET FROM THE CONTRACTOR. BUT  SOMETHING THAT LONG WILL PROBABLY TAKE A MONTH TO DO. NICK  SAYS MORE THAN THAT. HE'S CORRECTING ME. 
00:37:27.130: >> IS THERE ANY--
00:37:28.565: >> YOU'LL BE DEALING WITH ODOR FOR THAT WHOLE LENGTH OF TI TIME.
00:37:33.270: >> IS THERE A PUBLIC RISK? IS THEREIN CREASED HEALTH HAZARD  OR JUST A NUISANCE? 
00:37:39.409: >> IT'S MOSTLY A NUISANCE. 
00:37:41.378: >> TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, I WOULD DEAL WITH THAT NUANCE FOR THAT MUCH MONEY. UM, I JUST FIND IT -- IT'S A LOT OF MONEY  TO SPEND JUST TO REDUCE THE  THE ODOR. BUT FOR ONE MONTH OF OD ODOR. IT DOESN'T CAUSE A PUBLIC HEALTH HAZARD. 
00:38:01.031: >> IT'S PERC PERCEIVED BY THE PUBLIC AS A HEALTH H HAZARD BECAUSE OF THE CHEMICAL NATURE OF THE EXCEL. >  SMELL. 
00:38:12.309: >> I DON'T KNOW. I JUST KNOW I CAN'T SUPPORT IT AND I WON'T  BE SUPPORTING IT. AND, UH, I THINK WE CAN EDUCATE OUR  PUBLIC AND CAMPAIGN AND DO SOMETHING AND BETTER SPEND THAT  MONEY TOWARDS THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE HAVE.
00:38:27.724: >> FOR THE DISCUSSION, COUNCILMM BER NELSON. 
00:38:31.995: >> I JUST WONDERED. YOU MENTIONED THAT THE LAST TIME WE  USED THE METHOD THAT HAS THE OWE DORM WAS AT VETS PARK. DO  YOU REMEMBER HOW-- WAS THAT YEARS AND YEARS AGO? HOW RECENT WAS THAT? 
00:38:46.042: >> NOW, YOU'RE GOING TO TEST MY MEMORY.
00:38:48.345: >> SORRY. 
00:38:49.112: >> PROBABLY THREE YEARS AGO. 
00:38:51.515: >> OKAY. SO PEOPLE PROBABLY REMEMBER?
00:38:54.351: >> AS PEOPLE TELL ME, CRAIG, TAKE YOUR TIME ESTIMATE AND  DOUBLE IT BECAUSE YOUR TIME GOES BY FASTER AS I'VE GOAT E ENOLDER. THEY WILL REMEMBER IT. 
00:39:06.029: >> THANK YOU. 
00:39:07.931: >> *. I   COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
00:39:12.302: >>  I HAD THESE CONCERNS THAT IT SAID IN THE ANSWERS THAT AREAS WITH LIE PEDESTRIAN ACTIVITY WHERE PEOPLE COULD BE  AFFECTS BY THE ODORS, SO BASICALLY DOWNTOWN AREAS.  AND SO IS IT EVER CONSIDERED WHETHER WE BID THESE THINGS OUT THAT IF SOMETHING IS HAPPENING IN DOWNTOWN, WE ARE MAKING A  SPECIAL EXCEPTION BECAUSE IT'S A DOWNTOWN SITUATO N WHERE  YOU HAVE DIFFERENT-- WE DO STUFF LIKE THIS ALL THE TIME WHERE YOU HAVE DIFFERENT TRAFFIC CONTROL THINGS, YOU HAVE  CR CROSS DIFFERENT SIDEWALKS-- SHOULD DOWNTOWN AUTHORITY PICK  UP PART OF THE BILL? SHOULD THE DVA PAY PART OF THE COST? IF IT'S A DIFFICULTY TO WORK IN THESE DOWNTOWN AREAS WHERE  IT'S CROWDED THAN IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS, THAT'S WHY CURI CURIOSITY. IS THERE W ANYWAY TO WRITE THIS SPENCE OFF, THE  NECESSARYITY OF HAVING A CROWDED DOWNTOWN? ANYBODY? 
00:40:11.728: >> A  ANYONE?  >
00:40:16.867: >> MA I WANT TO KNOW IF THEY CAN PICK UP THE DIFFERENCE. 
00:40:22.873: >> I WOULD SAY THAT OUR DIRECTIN IS WHEREVER WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS TYPE OF LINING, WE'RE MOVING TO A PRODUCT FREE OF  STYRENE WHETHER IT'S IN THE DOWNTOWN OR WHETHER IT'S RESIDENTIAL. 
00:40:35.051: >> OKAY. THE WAY THE ANSWER CAME BACK IT SOUNDED LIKE IT WAS A PROBLEM WHERE IT'S A QUOTE AREAS OF HIGH PEDESTRIAN  ACTIVITY. SO -.
00:40:43.827: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON. 
00:40:47.664: >> COUNCILMEMBER NELSON: IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT THE VETS  PARK PROJECT HAPPENED MAYBE THREE YEARS AGO. IS THIS THE  FIRST PROJECT THAT WE WILL BE UTILIZING THE MORE EXPENSIVE, NON-STYRENE? 
00:41:01.478: >> OF THIS SIZE, A PROJECT OF THIS SIZE. I DON'T KNOW IF  WE'VE DONE LINING IN THE INTERVENING. AND IT WOULD HAVE  BEEN -- IF WE HAVE, IT'S ON SMALLER 8-INCH PIPES, NOT 33. IT'S GETTING TO BE A FAIR LARGE PIPE THAT WILL BREATHE AND  VENT OUT INTO THE ATMOSPHERE. 
00:41:21.131: >> SO WE'VE BEEN USING NON-STYRN E FOR PIPES THAT WOULDN'T VENT OUT?
00:41:25.735: >> NO, WE'VE BEEN USING STYRENE IN THE SMALLER. 
00:41:29.172: >> I FOLLOW. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU.
00:41:30.907: >> FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER GRAND. 
00:41:35.078: >> WHEN I LOOKED AT STYRENE ON OSHA. IT SAYS IT COULD ALSO  BE AN IRRITANT AND CAUSE THINGS LIKE RESPIRATR Y PROBLEMS. SO WHEN YOU SAY WE'RE MOVING AWAY FROM USING S STYRENE, IT  SEEMS LIKE IT'S NOT JUST ACTUALLY ODOR BUT IT CAUSES EYE  IRRITAI ON POTENTIALLY. 
00:41:55.899: >> IF THE CONCENTRATIONS ARE HIGH ENOUGH. 
00:41:57.968: >> SO IS THAT A-- WAS THAT PART OF THE PROBLEM WITH THE  COMPLAINS IN A HIGH--
00:42:04.240: >> WE DID NOT HEAR THAT PREVIOUL Y. OF IRRITATIONS. 
00:42:10.080: >> WHAT ABOUT FOR THE PEOPLE THAT DO THE WORK? 
00:42:12.682: >> THEY WEAR PROPER PPE, PERSONL PRO TECHTIVE EQUIPMENT. 
00:42:20.290: >> BUT IT'S * LISTED AS A PROBABLE CA SIN GENERAL. CARCINOGEN. 
00:42:27.864: >> AS I SAID IT'S NOT A NICE MATERIAL.
00:42:29.432: >> IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE WE'RE MOVING AWAY FROM IT BASED ON  ODOR BUT BASED ON SCIENCE. IT'S POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS AND  NOT JUST A BAD SMELL. 
00:42:40.844: >> FURTHER DISCUSSION? PERHAPS WE CAN MOVE ON -. [ROLL  CALL]. 
00:42:49.052: >> [VOTING]. 
00:42:57.794: >> MOTION CARRY. 
00:43:09.773: >> CA 10 RESOLUTION TO-- POUR PUBLIC PREPONDERANCATION,  CHAPTER-- PUBLIC PARTICIPATION, IP,  INTERNATION AL ASSOCIATION FOR PUBLIC PARTICP  IAP2. -- COMMUNITY  ENGAGEMENT, TRAINING SERVICES, THE AMOUNT OF $45,000. COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD-- COUNCILMEMBER LUMM-- >  COUNCILMEMBER  GRISWOLD.
00:43:40.003: >> I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS IS A COMMUNICATION  RESOLUTION AND COMPLIMENT STAFF ON WORKING TO IMPROVE COMMUNICATIONS. THE SECOND THING IS I WANT TO POINT OUT  THAT, WHILE IT'S ONLY $45,000, IT IS A ONE WEEK CLASS. AND  SO THERE'S ALSO THE COST OF STAFF ATTENDING THIS.  BUT I WILL BE SUPPORTING IT. 
00:44:07.931: >> FURTHER DISCUSSION? COUNCILMEMBER LUMM. 
00:44:12.335: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM:  I STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS INVESTMENT AND STAFF TRAINING IN COMMUNITY ENGAGEMET . IT'S NOT A HUGE  INVESTMENT. BUT I CAN'T THINK OF MANY OTHER THINGS WHERE  MONEY IS BETTER USED THAN ENSURING QUALITY PUBLIC PARTICIPATION AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT. SO THANK YOU. 
00:44:33.323: >> FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAIR? IT'S APPROVED. CA 7,  RESOLUTION TO APPROVE THE PURCHASING OF-- (RECORD READ. ) I  FORGET WHO DID THIS ONE. COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER, SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD. 
00:44:58.181: >> I RECEIVED A QUESTION FROM A RESIDENT TODAY ABOUT, SINCE  THE MAJORIY OF THESE PEDESTRIAN RECYCLING CONTAINERS WILL  BE IN THE DOWNTOWN AREA, FOR THE 83,000, IS ANY OF THIS FUNDING COMING FROM THE DDA SINCE THE FUNDING APPEARS TO BE  WITHIN THE DDA DISTRICT.
00:45:20.537: >> PLEASE. 
00:45:22.205: >> HI. MOLLY-- PUBLIC WORKS-- THE $83,000 IS FOR OUR SHARE, THE DDA HAS AGREED TO PURPOSE HALF OF THE CANS AS WELL. THAT'S ADDITIONAL PURCHASE OUTSIDE OF THAT. 
00:45:35.084: >> OKAY. 
00:45:35.652: >> THERE WERE MORE THAN 100 CANS IN THE DOWNTOWN. 
00:45:39.389: >> THANK YOU. 
00:45:39.989: >> FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL THAT FAVOR?
00:45:42.492: >> AYE. 
00:45:44.160: >> OPPOSE-- IT'S APPROVED. RESOLUTION TO CONTRACT GREEN  INFRASTRUCTR E FOR ONE YEAR WITH COUNTY WATER COMMISSIONER THE AMOUNT OF $165,000. MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER LUMM. 
00:46:00.210: >> YES, WE HAD A QUESTION ON THIS ONE, AGAIN THE ENVIR ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION AND VARIOUS SUBCOMMT TEES ARE  WORKING ON THE ISSUE OF RAIN GARDENS AND VEGETATION AND SO  FORTH. AND WITH REGARDS TO THIS PAINTEC E, MAINTENANCE, WHO DETERMIN ES WHO IS UNSIGHTLY VEGETATION? AND WHAT TREATMENT WAS GOING TO BE PROVIDED? AND THE REASON WE'RE ASKING ABOUT WHAT'S  UNSIGHTLY AND VEGETATIN AND WHAT SORT OF TREATMENT IS GOING TO BE PROVIDED IS THAT FALL VEGETATION IS REFUGE FOR SEEDS  AND POLLINATORS AND OTHER WILDLIFE. AND TREATMENT SHOULD B BE, WE WOULD SUGGEST FOR MECHANICAL REMOVAL, GIVEN THAT  THESE AREAS ARE WET LANDS AND WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT CHEMICAL  TREATMENT IF ANY WAS GOING TO BE INCLUDED IN THIS. AND IF CHEMICAL IS INCLUDED, WHAT CHEMICALS WILL BE USED? 
00:47:07.877: >> GOOD EVENING, I'M JENNIFER. NOTES ARE WONDERFUL  QUESTIONS TO ASK ABOUT GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE MAINTENANE . THE UNSIGHTLY VEGETATION IS ALONG THE (INAUDIBLE)  PLANTS THAT ARE UNDESIRABLE AND NOT INTENDED TO BE IN THE GREEN  INFRASTRUCTURE. IT WILL BE HAND REMOVED, SOME MECHANICAL. BUT MOSTLY USING WATER SAFE CHEMICALS IF THERE'S AIR  CHEMICAL THAT'S GOING TO BE USED. MAJORITY OF THE  VEGETATION IS LEFT FOR THE WINNER IT WILDLIFE, IF YOU WILL.  SO TAKING THAT ENVIRONMENTAL STANCE INTO ACCOUNT. WE MAKE  SURE THAT THAT VEGETATION IS LEFT OVER THE WIN INTERPR WINTER FOR SEED  AND HABITAT. 
00:47:52.488: >> OKAY, GREAT. SO IS THERE ANY SPECIFIC WATER SOLUBLE  CHEMICALS YOU'RE THINKING OF? 
00:47:58.728: >> WE WORK WITH WEED MANAGEMENT CONTRACTOR. IT'S ACTUALLY A  LOCAL NATIVE PLANT NURSERY THAT WE WORK WITH NOR THIS VEGETATION MANAGEMENT. I DON'T KNOW THE NAME OF THE  CHEMICAL. BUT IT'S SOMETHING I BELIEVE OUR OWN NAP USES AS  WELL. 
00:48:15.411: >> OKAY. AND THE LAST QUESTION WOULD THEN-- THANK YOU FOR  ANSWERING THOSE. WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MONITORIG THESE  RAIN GARDENS? 
00:48:26.422: >> ME. 
00:48:27.223: >> [LAUGHTER]. WE ACTUALLY HAVE A TEAM AT THE CITY AND  COUNTY THAT DO AN ANNUAL OBSERVATION OF THE GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE WITHIN THE CITY THAT WE OWN AND OPERATE AND  MANAGE. SO WE DO A CONDITION ASSESSMENT PERIODICALLY, MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE AS PER DESIGN. 
00:48:45.808: >> OKAY, THAT'S GREAT. BECAUSE THE PESTICIDES GROUP WILL BE MEETING ON FRIDAY. SO WE'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT PESTI PESTICIDES, HERBIE SIDES, FUNG SI A SIDES. AND WE'LL BE  WORKING ON THAT * FORWARD. THANK YOU FOR THE INFORMATION ON THE MECHANICAL PROCESSES.
00:49:05.495: >> I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS. THIS $165,000 ONE YEAR  CONTRAC, IS THIS EXPECTED TO BE AN ONGOING THING EVERY YEAR  NOW? 
00:49:14.303: >> GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE IS NOT FREE. GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE  DOES REQUIRE A FAIR AMOUNT OF MAINTENANCE. WHAT WE HAVE  LOOKED AT FOR THAT $165,000 IS COORDINATION OF VOLUNTEERS, CORD NATION OF CONTRACTORS AS WELL AS PA PAYING SOMEONE TO COORDINATE THAT ACTIVITY. WE HAVE ALMOST 200 INSTALLATIONS  ACROSS THE CITY OF GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE. IF IT IS A-- IT'S  NOT GOING TO BE $165,000 EVERY YEAR. THE NUMBER WILL CHANGE BASED ON UPDATED NEEDS AND UPDATED CONDITION ASSESSMENTS. 
00:49:47.804: >> THIS IS PROBABLY NOT-- ON THE TON OF YOUR HEAD. HOW THE  SQUARE FOOTAGE DIFFER FROM REGULAR PARK MAINTENANCE OR  PRESERVATION MAINTENANCE? COST MORE OR LESS? I'M C CURIOUS. SHOULD WE INCREASE THIS ACROSS THE CITY, SHOULD WE BUDGET  THIS ACCORDINGLY?
00:50:10.026: >> I WOULD SAY TOTALLY IT'S PROBABLY A WHOLE LOT MORE  EXPENSIVE THAN MOWING THE LAWN. BUT IT COMPARES TO THE  EX  EXPENDITURES. WE WORK WITH NAP TO COME UP WITH THESE CALCULATIONS. 
00:50:27.477: >> COUNCILMEMBER, I ALSO ADD THAT RAIN GARDEN IS ALSO  RETENTION IN WATER QUALITY. IF YOU WANT TO MAKE 2 A  WHOLESALE COMPARISON, YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE COST OF  INSTALI NG MORE STORM WATER LINES, POTENTA LLY COLLECTING  THE WATER AND TREAT IT. I THINK WHEN YOU DO THAT YOU PROVE IT'S GREAT VALUE FOR THE MONEY.
00:50:49.298: >> WHEN YOU INSTALL THE HARD EVERYONED GRAY INFRASTRUCTURE  THAT SILTS, YOU ALSO HAVE TO CLEAN AND MAINTAIN THOSE ALSO. SO IT'S NOT A CLEAR CUT COST ONLY. AND THIS IS COMING OUT  OF THE STORMWATER FUND BECAUSE IT IS CLEANING UP STORMWATER AND RETAINING STORMWATER. 
00:51:14.357: >> COUNCILMEMBER LUMM. 
00:51:15.558: >> I WANT TO SHARE-- THAT I SERVE ON THE MOUNDS CREEK  COORDINATD COMMITTEE. IT'S THE ONLY CREEK SHED THAT HAS A  COMMITTEE. AND THIS COMMITTEE REVIEWS SITE PLANS AND REV REVIEWED BY CITY STAFF. THE MEETINGS ARE LED BY OUR STORM ORDER AND FLOODS PLANE COORDINATOR JERRY-- AND THE  COMMISSIONERS ALONG WITH STAFF, ALONG WITH PLANNING STAFF REVIEW THE SITE PLANS FOR STORMWATER MANAGEMENT. THESE ARE  ALL PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT PLANS.  ONE OF THE THINGS THIS CONVERSAI ON JUST NOW REMINDED ME OF THIS. THAT OUR STORM PROGRAM COOR COORDINATOR JERRY HANCOCK HAS  BEEN INTERET ED US LOOKING AT IT -- FOR SOMETIE NOW, HAS  BEEN AN ORDINANCE, SOMETHING TO REQUIRE MAINTENANCE. OF THESE STORMWATER SYSTEMS, MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS RAIN GARDENS, ET  CETERA. BY PRIVATE DEVELOPERS AND PRIVATE DEVELOPE NT. THERE  IS NO WAY RIGHT NOW TO ENSURE THE SYSTEMS ARE BEING MAIN MAINTAINED. WE APPROVED A LOT OF PROJECTS AROUND THE BREYER WOOD AREA. AND AS THESE REVIEWED-- INVARIABLY WE DISCOVERED THAT THEIR  RAIN GARDENS, WHATEVER, AGAIN NOT RETENTION, DIS      N DETENTION SYS SYSTEMS, INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S NOT BEEN WELL MAINTAINED BUT  THERE'S NO WAY TO, NOW, ANYWAY, TO CHECK ON THESE IN PRIVATE  DEVELOPMET S. I DON'T KNOW, I SEE YOU NODDING. I'M PROBABLY NOT EXPLAINING THIS WELL. ANYWAY, IT'S  SOMETHING TO TOSS OUT THERE. I THOUGHT I'D MAKE YOU AWARE OF THAT. NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE CITY'S GREEN  INFRASTRUCTUE . AND WHAT WE CAN DO-- OR NOT, WHAT WE NEED  TO DO TO MAINTAIN THAT. AND I'M GLAD YOU ALSO INDICATED AS A LONG-TERM STRATEGY, MAYBE LOOKING AT THIS INHOUSE AS THIS TYPE OF INFRASTRUCTURE GROWS.  BUT IT'S A BIGGER ISSUE. ALL THE PRIVATE PROPERTY AROUND TOWN. 
00:53:32.128: >> (AWAY FROM MICROPHONE)
00:53:34.397: >> IS THERE ANY EFFORT BY STAFF TO UPDATE THE VEGETATION  ORDINANE TO MAKE IT GREENER AND TO ACCOMMODATE RAIN GAR GARDENS? OR IF THERE ISN'T, WOULD YOU PREFER THAT IT BE FINIS  FI  INITIATED BY COUNCIL? 
00:53:57.687: >> I'M NOT SURE IF OUR ORDINANCE ELIMINATES OR DOES NOT  ALLOW RAIN GARDEN, WE TRY TO ENSURE THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR RESIDENTS TO DO THAT. WE ENCOURAGE RESIDENTS. 
00:54:11.000: >> AND AS WE WORK ON PROJECTS WHERE WE HAVE NATIVE PLANTS  BEING USED, WE SELECT THOSE NATIVE PLANTS WITH SENSITIVITY  TO WHERE THEY ARE, IF THEY'RE NEAR SITE LINES OR SITE LINES,  IT'S APPROPRIATELY CHOSEN WITH CONSULTATION WITH TRAFFIC ENGINEERS.
00:54:33.889: >> THAT'S GREAT. THERE'S STILL A REFERENCE TO LAWN AND TURF GRASS NOT MORE THAN 12-INCHES. WE CAN TALK OFF LINE. I  JUST THINK THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAYBE BE MORE SPECIFIC IN OUR ORDINANCE SO WE DON'T HAVE TENSIONS BETWEEN NEIG NEIGHBORS.
00:54:49.739: >> FURTHER DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR?
00:54:51.974: >>   A. WE NOW COME TO A PUBLIC HEARING, IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PUBLIC MEMBERS TO SPEAK ABOUT A SPECIFIC ITEM IN AN  AGENDA. TO SPEAK YOU NEED NOT HAVE SIGNED UP IN ADVANCED BUT YOUR SPEECH MUST RELATE TO THE SUBJECT OF THE MEETING  THAT'S THE SPECIFIC ITEM ON THE AGENDA. YOU HAVE THREE  AMERICANS TO SPEAK. AME  MINUTES TO SPEAK. WE MAY ONLY HAVE ONE PERSON ST SPEAKING AT A  TIME. IF YOU REQUIRE ASSISTANCE FOR-- #1, -. -- (RECORD READ. )  AND 5. 2-- 3. 7, CHAPTER 55, THE UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT COLD OF  THE CITY OF ANNE ARBOR. PREMIUM OPTIONS, AFFO AFFORDABLE HOUSING  -- IS THERE ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC HEARING? 
00:56:06.115: >> JIM. I'VE BEEN WORKING ON AF AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR A WH WHILE. I WANT TO BRING YOU BACK 20 YEARS, BEFORE THE REZ REZONING. IF YOU HAD A LARGE PROJECT IN DOWNTOWN ANNE ARBOR  YOU HAD TO DEAL WITH THE DUD ORDINANCE. SO A NUMBER OF KNOWS WORKING ON THOSE, A MEMBER OF CITY  COUNCIL-- YOU HAVE TO REQUEST TO GET A PUD * SO IT'S OKAY  THROUGH MICHIGAN LAW AND WE INCORPORATE AFFORDABLE HOUSE INNING PROJECTS.  PEOPLE MAY REMEMBER ASH LIE HUGHES ASHLEY MUSE THAT WAS INCLUDE D. IT'S A  HUGE HEADACHE BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS IS, YOU HAVE TO MONITOR THAT THE DEVELOPER HAS TO MONITOR THE PEOPLE THAT LIVE THERE  AND WHAT THEIR INCOME ARE, WHAT THEIR INCOME IS THAT THEY'RE  NOT MANIPULATN G IT. AND ALL THIS KIND OF STUFF. THE SAME  THING THAT HAPPENS WITH PEOPLE THAT ARE IN PROJECT BASED SECTION 8 HOUSING. THE SAME THING HAPPENS.  SO FINALLY PETER ALLEN SAID, WHAT WE SHOULD DO IS MAKE THE UNIT SMALLER. WE'LL HAVE MURPHY BEDS AND HAVE THE BEDS  COMING OUT OF THE CLOSET. FINALLY HE SAID, LET'S HAVE A  (INAUDIBLE) I REMEMBER BEING IN A CONFEREC E ROOM, I CAN'T  REMEMBER WHO ELSE WAS THERE. AND I ASKED HIM, SO PETER CAN  THE DEVELOPERS FINANCE THE PAYMENT IN L LIEU? HE SAID YES. SO NOW WE HAVE PAYMENT IN LIEU. AND LOW AND BEHOLD, THAT'S  WHAT PEOPLE WERE DOING.  IT MAKES NO SENSE TO HAVE THIS THING IN YOUR-- TO HAVE THE  AFFORDAL E HOUSING IN YOUR PROJECT BECAUSE WHEN YOU TRY TO  SELL IT, IT'S A HASSLE. THE REASON I'M BRINGING THIS UP-- NORMALLY I'M IN FAVOR OF PUTTING UP AFFORDABLE HOUSING. I'VE BEEN RAISING MONEY FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING, LOW INCOME  ALL THESE YEARS.  WHAT COULD HAPPEN IS, IF IT'S NOT THE LEVEL OF INCOME OF THE PERSON GETTING THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT'S KEEPING THE  AFFORDABLE HOUSING FROM BEING IN THE DEVELOPMENT-- WHAT YOU  COULD BE DOING IS ACTUALLY DECREASING THE AMOUNT OF MONEY  GOING INTO THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING TRUST FUND. BECAUSE PEOPLE WILL STILL BE USING THE PAYMENT IN LIEU. BUT THE  AMOUNT WHEN YOU DO THE FORMULA IT'S BASED ON A HIGHER INC INCOME. SO THE DIFFERENTIAL IS LESS. AND SO YOU'RE T PUTTING LESS MONEY INTO THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THAT PE PERSON NEEDS TO WORK AGAINST THAT TIGHT.  TIED.  SO JIM, THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR YEARS, WHY DID  YOU S YOU SAY ANYTHING EARLIER? I JUST HAPPENED TO LOOK AT  THE AGENDA AND REALIZED THIS PROJECT COULD BE A PROBLEM OVER TIME. I WANT TO BRING THAT UP. YOU MAY NOT GET THE  AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT YOU WANT. AND WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT  HOW TO DO THAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
00:59:08.697: >> THANK YOU. 
00:59:17.506: >> GOOD EVENING. MY NAME IS SHAWN. WE'RE A LOCAL DEVELOPER  HERE IN ANNE ARBOR N REGARDS TO-- I WANT TO GO OFF WITH THE  GENTLEMAN BEFORE YES WAS SPEAKING ABOUT, IS THAT IT'S MORE  CHALLENGING WITHIN A DEVELOPMENT TO HAVE AFFORDABLE -- TO TRY TO MANAGE THAT AS WELL AS THE FINANCING VEHICLES THAT  COME WITH IT. PAYMENT IN LIEU IS A MANAGEABLE ASPECT. THE  INTERESTING ASPECT IS PREVIOUSLY WHEN THIS WHOLE  CONVERSATION BEGAN, THEY HAD A WORKING SESSION WITH THE PLANNING COMMISSION. THEY BROUGHT MYSELF IN. , LOCAL  ARCHITECT IN AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROVIDES WITHIN THE  AREA TO TALK ABOUT. AND ONE OF THEM N NOTED FOR EVERY PRIVATE  DOLLAR THAT I CAN GET I CAN LEVERAGE THAT FOR 25 MORE DOLLARS. THE INTERESTING ASPECT IS THE CONVERSATION IS NOT  NECESSARILY WHERE DOES THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING NEED TO BE AT BUT WHAT IS THE BEST WAY IN REGARDS TO GETTING AFFORDABLE  HOUSING? IF THAT METHODOLOGY IS GETTING MORE AFFORDABLE  HOUSING THE DOWNTON BY NATURE IS AN EXPENSIVE AREA TO DO  BUSINESS. THE COST OF CONGENITAL TRUCK AND LAND AND TAXES ARE EXPENSIVE. THE FEES AND THE CONNECTION CHARGES TO  CONNECT INTO THE WATER SYSTEM ARE EXPENSIVE. THERE WERE A  LOT OF FEES AND COSTS THAT COME INTO PLAY FOR A DEVELOPER TO TRY TO MAKE A PROJECT FINGERRABLE.  FI FINANCEABLE. WE CAN QUANTIFY BETTER,  PAYMENT IN LIE, YOU CAN UTILIZE THAT  THROUGH THE PARTNERS OR  THE CITY'S METHOD TS THAT YOU UTILIZE AND LEVERAGE THAT FOR MUCH MORE VALUE AND BE ABLE TO GET MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAN YOU COBY POLI IMPLEMENTING THIS PREMIUM AND PUTTING INTO A  DOWNTOWN AREA.  THE QUESTION IS, WHAT DO WE WANT TO ACCOMPLISH AND WHAT IS  THE METHOD TO ACCOMPLISH THAT? ONE OF THE THINGS ON HERE  WITH REGARDS TO-- OBVIOUSLY WE'RE A DEVELOPER. WE'RE NOT  REALLY IN F FAVOR OF THIS. WE THINK IT WILL HINDER  DEVEL DEVELOPMENT IN DOWNTOWN. ONE OF THE THINGS IS 2 LOOKS AT  THE 30% AND THAT YOU HAVE  AN ACC AN ACCESSIB LE HEIGHT IN THERE. YOU HAVE ONE ON WASHINGTON STREET WHICH WENT THROUGH PLANNING NOT TOO LONG AGO, REQUESTING 20 SOME FEET OR  SOMETHING LIKE AS WELL AS VILLAGE SOUTH WHICH IS A PROJECT I  REPRESENT.  WE WERE ABLE TO UTILIZE THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING PEOPLE  BUT WE CANNOT MAXIMUM OUR FAR B BECAUSE WE ARE LIMITED ON OUR HEIGHT. WE WANT TO MOVE FORWARD BUT IT'S CRUCIAL AND MAKE PROJECTS  TO EVEN ATTEMPT TO GET TO THAT 0% MARK. WITH THAT AGAIN, I  WOULD * 30% * WHAT CHAL CHALLENGE YOU TO THINK WHAT WE WANT TO  ACCOMPLISH AND WHAT'S THE BEST METHOD TO GET THERE. THANK  YOU.
01:02:14.316: >> THANK YOU. 
01:02:15.684: >> GOOD EVENING. TOM -. LIKE TO GIVE JUST A MOMENT FOR A SHOUT OUT FOR THE JUNIOR HIGH KIDS WATCHING AT HOME. GET  YOUR BINGO CARDS OUT. BASED ON WHAT THE LAST TWO SPEAKS SAID, I'M GOING TO CHANGE WHAT I'M GOING TO SAY. I LIKE THE  THINGS THEY RAISED.  WE REALLY HAVE TO HAVE A DISCUSI ON. IS IT BETTER TO BUILD  AFFORDABE HOUSING DOWNTOWN OR HAVE THAT MONEY, PUT IT IN  THE PAYMENT LIEUTENN T FUND LIEU FUND, AND LEVERAGE IT. WE HEARD FROM THE  DEVELOPER ABOUT THE HURTERS AND THE FINANCING AND OBSTACLES.  THERE'S ONE ITEM I WANT TO BRING UP. AND IT'S THAT HEIGHT  BONUS. AND YNG. IS SA% MOR 15% MORE HEIGHT? 30% MORE HEIGHT? WHAT IS THE RIGHT NUMBER OR ZERO? I THINK THE PROCESS IS  WHAT'S IMPORTAT . THE PEOPLE OF ANNE ARBOR HOWEVER WE GOT  HERE WITH OUR PROCESS, MASTER PLANS, A2D2 PROCESS, WE SET A  HEIGHT LIMIT FOR DOWNTOWN. WHATEVER THE NUMBER S THAT'S OUR  NUMBER. I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE CHANGING THAT NUMBER UP  OR DOWN AS PART OF THIS PREMIUM PROCESS WITHOUT PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT. THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE ARE NOT AWARE THAT THIS MIGHT  ALL OF A SUDDEN HAPPEN. IT MIGHT BE A GOOD THING. YOU  MIGHT FIND OUT FROM THE PUBLIC THAT THEY'RE WILLING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO DOUBLE THE NUMBER WE'RE PROPOSING IN  THIS PREMIUM. WE DON'T KNOW WHERE IT'S GOING TO GO. ONE THING WE KNOW IS MOST PEOPLE ARE COMPLETELY UNAWARE OF THE CHANGE AND CHARACTER OF THEIR DOWNTOWN THAT COULD HAPPEN IF  THIS PASSES, THE WAY IT'S WITHOUT PUBLIC ENGAGEE NT. WE'RE ABOUT TO HAVE A MASTER PLAN PROCESS. A BIG PART IS  PUBLIC ENGAGEMN T. WE WANT PUBLIC PARTICIPATION. WE NEED  THE PUBLIC TO TRUST THE CITY IS LISTENING TO THEM. WHEN WE  DO THINGS WITHOUT PUBLIC ENGAGEMET , WE RISK THAT TRUST. I  KNOW IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD, THERE'S A LACK OF TRUST IN THE  MASTER PLAN PROCESS BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE PARTICIPATED IN  THE MASTER PLAN. AND THE MASTER PLAN WASN'T FOLLOWED. HOW  DO WE GET THEIR TRUST BACK?  IF WE DO ONE THING AFTER ANOTHER WITHOUT PROPER PUBLIC  ENGAGEMENT, I'M RAISING THE ADU ORDINANCE REVISIONS WHICH YOU VOTED DOWN PRIMARILY BECAUSE THERE WASN'T PROPER PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT. AND SINCE THEN WE'VE SEEN AN EFFORT FOR BETTER  PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT LIKE IN THE SHORT-TERM RENTALS AND  SIDEWALK ISSUES.  SO THAT'S GREAT. WE'RE REALLY IMP IMPROVING. I THINK WE NEED  TO FOCUS ON PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT IF WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THAT  PIECE OF THIS WORK. AS FAR AS THE REST OF THAT, I'LL LEAVE  IT TO OTHER PEOPLE. THANK YOU. 
01:05:08.090: >> THANK YOU. 
01:05:17.299: >> HELLO, CITY  CITY COUNCIL. MY NAME IS HA HANNAH. FIRST THINGS FIRST,  I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO GIVE CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS  DUE. THIS WAS PROPERTY TO YOU D TODAY IN NO SMALL PART, THE  R ROOSEVELT INSTITUTE FELT COMPELLED TO ADVOCATE TO ENCOURAGE  AND INTEN AT THIS VIES AFFORDABLE HOUSING. * ONE OF THE STUDENTS WHO PUSHED FOR THIS DID SO WHEN HE WAS A GRADUATING SENIOR KNOWING HE WOULD NOT SEE THIS POLICY COME TO FRUITION  DURING HIS TIME AT THE UNIVERSITY.  I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU TO FOLLOW THAT SAME EXAMPLE AND ACT  IN THE SAME SELFLESS MANNER TO PURSUE TH THINGS BEYOND YOUR  PERSONAL CIRCUMSTANCES AND PASS ORDINANCE AND RESOLUTO N THAT WILL HELP TO IMPROVE THE FUTURE ANNE ARBOR IN A WAY  THAT THIS ORDINANCE HAS A POTENTIAL TO DO. IT'S NOT PER PERFECT. IT DOESN'T CAPTURE EVERYTHING, B AND MANY WILL AGREE TO THAT. BUT YOU HAVE TO DO WHAT YOU CAN WHEN YOU CAN. AND  23 IT HAS TON INCREMENTAL CHANGE, IT HAS TO BE * INCREMENTAL  CHANGE. SO THANK YOU. 
01:06:35.210: >> THANK YOU. 
01:06:36.411: >> GOOD EVENING. MY NAME IS DAVID. I'M A FIFTH WARD  RESIDENT. I'M HERE TO SHOW SUPPORT FOR B1, IT WILL CHANGE THE RESIDENTIAL PREMIUM FROM DOWNTOWN DEVELOPMENT FROM ONE  THAT REQUIRED RESIDENTIAL UNIT TO GAIN HEIGHT THAT REQUIRE  BOTH RESIDENTIAL AND HOUSING UNITS. THIS REVISION IS OVERDUE. DEVELOPMENT RIGHTS ARE A PRECIOUS  ASSET THAT A CITY CAN RARELY USE AND FOR TOO LONG WE HAVE  GIVEN OURS AWAY FOR FAR TOO LITTLE.  I BELIEVE THE CURRENT ORDINANCE IS AN IMPROVEMENT. THE  QUESTION I HAVE IS WHETHER OR NOT THIS ACTUALLY GOES FAR  ENOUGH. FOR EXAMPLE, DO WE REALLY NEED TO EXCEED THE 18 180-FOOT HEIGHT LIMIT BY AN ADDITIONAL 15% TO BE ABLE TO ASK  THAT 0 PERCENT 30 PERCENT UNITS BE AFFORDABLE? DO WE REALLY NEED TO GIVE AWAY ALL OF THE PARKING  REQUIREMENTS FOR THE AFFORDABLE UNITS TO THE DEV DEVELOPERS OR  SHOULD WE ASK FOR SOME PARKING FOR THOSE FOLKS WHO MAY VERY  WELL NEED IT BUT WHO MAY NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO PAY IN A PRIVATE MARKET GIVEN THEIR MORE LIMITED BUDGETS. FINALLY HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT THE BUILT AFFORDABLE UNITS A ARE  NOT A BUNCH OF MICRO APARTMENTS INSTEAD OF WHAT IS NEEDED BY  OUR COMMUNITY WHICH IS ONE, TWO, THREE BEDROOM UNITS AT AN  AFFORDABLE PRICE.  THE PEOPLE OF THIS COMMUNITY NEED A VARIETY OF HOUSING  AVAILABL. I APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORT TO PROVIDE THESE  OUTCOMES FOR THEM. THANK YOU. 
01:08:29.124: >> THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS PUBLIC  HEARING? 
01:08:37.365: >> GOOD EVENING, DOUG-- ON ANNE STREET. SO AFFORDABLE  HOUSING IS A PROBLEM HERE. IT'S A PROBLEM IN MOST AMERICN CITIES. IT'S NOT A NEW PROBLEM. IT'S LONG BEEN A PROBLEM. THE MARKET HAS HAD TROUBLE FOR MANY DECADES SUPPLYING  AFFORDABLE HOUSINGMN T A LOT OF REASONS PROBABLY OUR  EXPECTATIONS ARE TOO HIGH IN TERMS OF SPATIAL AND OTHER  STANDARDS.  WHEN I WAS ASKED BY THE STATE OF WASH STATE OF WASHINGTO N TO DO A STUDY  YEARS AGO, I PRODUCED A HUGE REPORT. WE FOUND THAT, YOU KNOW, THERE HAS TO BE SOME SUCTION DID I WHETHER IT'S  FEDERAL, LOCAL, OR STATE OR A COMBINATION. BUT AS AN ASIDE  I WANT TO SAY IS WHAT WE FOUND THE LOWEST HANGING FRUIT BY FAR FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING WAS ACCESSORY DRELG UNITS WHICH  IS NOT  DWELLING IEWJTS. IT'S NOT EASY. MINNEAPOLIS ALLOWED THREE ADUS FOR EVERY  SINGLE FAMILY DWELLING IN THE CITY. PORTLAND, 2. IT'S THE WAY TO MOST DIRECTLY DEAL. WE BUT WE NEED TO NO A THINK MORE BROADLY AND DRAMATICALLY AND  AGGRESSIVELY. THANK YOU. 
01:10:00.682: >> THANK YOU. 
01:10:02.083: >> AT THIS MAIM IS ZACHARY  NAME IS ZACHARY. AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THIS  COMMUNITY IS FAILING. IT KEEPS COMING UP. THERE'S SO MUCH FRICTION ON COUNCIL, AND NOTHING IS GETTING DONE. PERS PERSONALLY MYSELF, I LOVE THIS CITY SO MUCH. I'VE DECIDED  TO JUST LIVE HERE, FIND ALTERNATIVE WAYS OF LIVING SUMMERS WITH THE SUBLET MARKET WHICH IS ONE WAY YOU CAN FIND A  COLLEGE STUDENT WHO WANTS TO MAKE A FEW EXTRA HUNDRED DOLLARS IN THE SUMMER. AND YOU CAN LIVE HERE FOR ABOUT FOUR MONTHS. I'VE BEEN HOMELESS, LIVING ON, CRASHING ON MY  FRIENDS' COUCHES FROM COUCH TO COUCH.  SOMETHING YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IS WE HAVE AN ENTIRE  WORKFORC, WORKING IN OUR RESTAURANTS, WORKING IN OUR RETAIL  STORES WHO LIVE IN IPSE. WHO LIVE IN OTHER COMMUNITIES, FAMILIES ARE MOVING OUT TO THE SURROUNDING TOWNSHIPS BECAUSE THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO LIVE HERE.  SO 15% OF THE NEW DEVELOPMENT DOWNTOWN I UP TO 30%, YOU KNOW, I'D LIKE TO ECHO WHAT THE GENTLEMAN BEFORE ME SAID ABOUT  ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS. THERE ARE SO MANY RESIDENTS WHO  ARE KIND HEARTED, GIVELING PEOPLE G GIVING PEOPLE WHO WOULD WANT TO BUILD THIS ON THEIR PROPERTY AND WHO CAN, WHETHER WOULD BE ABLE TO  HOUSE PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE FAMILIES.  I MYSELF, I'M 345735 YEARS OLD. I DON'T WANT TO HAVE KIDS. YOU KNOW, THERE WERE ENOUGH KIDS IN THIS WORLD * 35 * WHO  NEED ADULTS TO BE THERE FOR THEM. AND AS A CHILD OF DID I  V  DIVORCED AND A BROTHER YOUNGER THAN ME, I FEEL LIKE I HAVE A  SON IN HIM.  ANNE ARBOR I THINK IS SEEN AS JUST FAMILY ORIENTED. AND I  SEE THAT, A LOT OF PEOPLE WANT TO KEEP IT THAT WAY AND THINK  THAT THAT'S THE STRENGTH EVER ANNE ARBOR.  BUT THE YOUNGER GENERATION, EVERYBODY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF  MICHIGAN, THE CLIMATE STRIKE AND EVERYTHING, CLIMATE CRISIS,  KNOW, THESE ARE VERY REAL PROBLEMS AND WE'RE GOING TO LOSE YOUNG PROFESSIONALS, PEOPLE WITH IDEAS THAT CAN BE VA VALUABLE TO THE COMMUNITY IF WE'RE ONLY DOING THINGS FOR FAMILIES,  FAMILY UNITS, AND FOR PEOPLE WITH WEALTHY MEANS.
01:13:13.441: >> THANK YOU. 
01:13:15.410: >> MY NAME IS -. I'M THINKING AHEAD A LITTLE BIT TO THE REAL ESTATE MARKET OF ABOUT TEN, 15 YEARS FROM NOW. WONDERING  WHERE THE MARKET WILL BE FOR AFFORDABLE SENIOR HOUSING DOWNTOWN■.%-p  !!%-pIT' NOTLOE SUBCOMMITTEE. NOT A SINGLE PERSON HAS SAID, TO TEAR THESE TREES DOWN. WE  NEED MORE LUXURY TOWN HOMES.  I FIND IT IRONIC AND DISAPPOINTN G THAT-- OKAY. AND I WI WILL-- TH I SUPPORT THIS AMENDMENT THAT WE TRY FOR $3 MILLION  OR SOME OTHER FIGURE. AND I IMPLORE IF THE DEVELOPER AND  THE OWNER ARE WATCHING, IF THEY WOULD PLEASE CONSIDER THIS AMENDMENT WHICH I WHOLE HEARTEDLY SUPPOR. THANK YOU. 
04:48:39.287: >> FURTHER COUNCILMEMBER LUMM.

04:48:50.399: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN.  > DOWN TO $1. 5 MILLION. THE  AMENDMENT TO THE AMENDMENT. IS THAT A FRIENDLY AMENDMENT TO  THE AMENDMENT? 
04:49:03.011: >> NO.
04:49:03.845: >> PROBABLY JUST TO VOTE.
04:49:06.515: >> VOTING ON THE 5. 5 FIRST. 
04:49:09.584: >> WE'RE MISSING GRA COUNCILM EMBER GRAND. ARE YOU WITH US? VOTING ON $1. 5 MILLION. THIS IS THE AMENDMENT TO THE  AMENDMENT. [ROLL CALL].
04:49:22.097: >> VOTE VOTE. [VOTING]
04:49:26.268: >> MOTION FAILED. 
04:49:45.720: >> THE AMENDMENT STANDS AS WAS. FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE  AMENDMENT? 
04:49:52.194: >> THIS IS FOR $3 MILLION. 
04:49:56.832: >> [VOTING]
04:50:28.829: >> MOTION CARRIES. 
04:50:30.232: >> THE MOTION A AMENDMENTED. AMEN AMENDS. COULD GO GRISWOLD.  COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD. 
04:50:42.244: >> MAY I AM AMEN AMEND IT TO NOT SPECIFY THE SUND SU SU FUNDING SOURCE? 
04:50:51.019: >> C SECOND BY-- COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD-- COUNCILMEMBER--
04:50:59.194: >> WE HAVE A LOT OF NEEDS IN THE CITY. USING AN UNSPECIFIED  FUN FUN FUNDING SOURCE IS THE HEIGHT OF IRRESPONSIBLE. IF WE  BELIEVE THAT WE COULD LEVERAGE AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUNDS 20  TIMES OVER, HOW MUCH C HOUSING CAN WE GET FOR $3 MILLION? IF WE  BELIEVE CLI WE HAVE CLIMATE ACTION PROGRAMS THAT WE WANT TO FUND AND POLICY WE HAVE TO TAKE. IF WE HAVE DIFFICULT TRADE OFFS COMING UP IN OUR TWO YEAR BUDGET, SPENDING $3 MILLION, I  MEAN, IT'S KIND OF A FANCY ANYWAY. BECAUSE WE KNOW THE  DEVELOPER IS NOT GOING TO TAKE IT. BUT VOTING TO EVEN  SUPPORT THAT, WE'RE JUST-- WE'RE JUST SELLING YOUR RESIDENTS  SHORT. I CAN'T SUPPORT THAT. 
04:51:51.046: >> FURTHER DISCUSSION? SORRY, COUNCILMEMBER--
04:51:54.749: >> I AM AN AM AMENDMENT TO AMENDMENT. TO SPECIFY THAT  GREENBELT DOLLARS BE UTILIZED-- THE ONLY OTHER OPTION IS  GENERAL FUND. AND--
04:52:05.493: >> IT CURRENTLY IS GREENBELT. SO.
04:52:07.529: >> NO, COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD'S AMENDMENT IS TO LEAVE IT TO  THE DISCRETO N OF THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR TO COME UP WITH THE  FUNDING SOURCE. AND BASICALLY WE HAVE TWO CHOICES. WE HAVE  GREENBELT MILLAGE OR GENERAL FUND. AND SO I'M AMENDING IT TO TES SPECIFY WHAT IT BE GREENBELT MILLAGE DOLLARS.
04:52:29.918: >> IT'S ALREADY GREENBELT MILLAGE DOLLARS. 
04:52:32.921: >> I'M SORRY. 
04:52:34.522: >> YOU ARE ARGUING AGAINST THE AMENDMENT. IF THE AMENDMENT  FAILS GREENBET IS SPECIFIED.
04:52:42.597: >> THESE GENERAL FUND DOLLARS REQUIRE -- YOU'RE AMENDING THE  BUDGET. AND THAT REQUIRES A VOTE AND AS IT SHOULD BECAUSE  THAT IS-- THAT'S A GOOD BUDGET DISCIPLINE REQUIREMENT. AND  SO I WON'T SUPPORT YOU KNOW, BREAKING THE BUDGET BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO BE USING GENERAL FUND, FUND RESERVES. THAT'S WHERE IT'S GOING TO COME FROM. WE HAVE A HEALTHY BALANCE RIGHT NOW BUT I THINK THIS IS TERRIBLE. IT'S LIKE  NO FISCAL DISCIPLINE TO GO THAT ROUTE.  AND SO IF THE CITY ADMINISTRATO, I DOUBT IF HE WOULD, CAME BACK WITH USING GENERAL FUND BALANCE DOLLARS, FOR ME THAT'S  COO. DOA. 
04:53:32.881: >> I JUST THINK, IF YOU LOOK AT BUYING A PIECE OF PROPERTY  FOR CERTAIN PURPOSES IS A MATTER OF POLICY- I THINK DARK  SOMEONE NEEDS TO DECIDE FUNDING SOURCE BECAUSE IT DICTATES USE. 
04:53:47.529: >> COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER AND ACKERMAN.
04:53:49.230: >> WE'RE SPEAKING TO THIS EE. ? AMENDMENT?
04:53:55.336: >> CORRECT. 
04:53:57.639: >> THIS IS A PARK AND GREENLAND PURCHASES SO THAT'S WHERE  THE HONEY  HONEST MONEY SHOULD COME  MONEY SHOULD COME FROM. 
04:54:12.887: >> GRILS
04:54:15.490: >> USE THE OPTION TO DEVELOP PART OF THE PROPERTY. IF  THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE, I WILL WITHDRAW MY AMENDMENT.
04:54:26.267: >> OBJECTION TO THE AMENDMENT'S WITHDRAWAL? THE DISCUSSION  AS THE MAIN MOTION AS AMENDED? COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
04:54:39.380: >> THANK YOU. THE IDEA THAT WE OFFER $3 MILLION WHEN THERE  WAS ANOTHER NUMBER OUT THERE IS A BUMMER BECAUSE WE PROBABLY  WON'T BE ENTERTAIE D. AND YET THERE'S ALWAYS ROOM TO  NEGOTIATION. SO I WAS HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS AS 4. 7 AND  SUPPORT IT AT $3. 0 MILLION. THE CHANCES OF ACQUIRING IT IS  REDUCED BY THAT NUMBER.  I LOVE HOW WE TALK ABOUT THE REAL NEEDS THAT THE CITY HAS. IT'S IMPORTANT WE TALK ABOUT IT AND MAKE THE CONSIDERATIONS THAT DOLLARS CAN BE LEVERAGED. AND DOLLARS SHOULD GO FOR THE RIGHT KINDS OF THINGS. ON THE EVE OF THIS-- THE SCHOOL  IS ASKING $1 BILLION FROM THE TAXPAYERS.  I THINK IT'S INTERESTING TO SEE HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE GOING TO CONSIDER THAT A REAL NEED TOMORROW RELATIVE TO SOME OF THE  ISSUES, OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING NEEDS AND ALL OF THAT. IT'S ALL COMING OUT OF THE SAME POCKET, THE TAXPAYER POCKET. AND  I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS. I DOUBT IT WILL PASS BUT IT'S  IMPORTANT TO PUT OTHER'S MONEYS W WHERE OUR MOUTHS ARE. IF WE  WANT TO SAVE THE TREES AND ALL THE OTHER THINGS, THEN VOTE  FOR THIS. VET FOR  VOTE FOR THESE AND MAKE AN EFFORT TO SAVE THE  TREES. 
04:56:08.036: >> FOR CUSHION. 
04:56:09.704: >> COUNCILMEMBER BANNISTER. 
04:56:10.939: >> I THINK THIS IS A PRIME EXAMPLE OF BEING A PENNY WEISS  AND WISE AND  A POUND FOOLISH. IT'S-- OUR ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY AND STEWARDSHIP AND YET WE'RE WILLING TO BUILD THIS HOUSING  IN PLACE OF THE CITY LOGO. THIS IS AN EXTREMELY RARE AND  CRITICAL STAND OF LANDMARK TREES.  AND FURTHERMORE, THIS HAS TO DO WITH EQUITY AND SOCIAL  JUSTICE. THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF STUDIES TO SHOW THAT YOU CAN  MAP INCOME TO TREE CANOPY ALL ACROSS THE UNITED STATES WITH HEALTHY NEIGHBORS HAVING TREE CANOPY AND POOR NEIGHBORHOODS  NOT. I WOULD PAY $3 MILLION, I WOULD PAY $4. 7 MILLION. TO  ME AGAIN THIS IS WHAT THE VOTER HAS TOLD US TO DO WHEN THEY PUT THE $6 MILLION IN GROWING IN THE GREENBELT FUND FOR THIS PURPOSE. BIDS ARE VANISHING FROM NORTH AMERICA IN THE LAST 50 YEARS. WE'VE LOST A THIRD OF OUR BIRD POPULATION DUE TO LOSS OF  HABITAT. THIS IS A SHAMEFUL DECISION. AND AGAIN, IT IS NOT  WHAT, EXCEPT FOR MAYBE COUNCILMEMBER GRAND, IT IS NOT WHAT  THE VOTER HAS BEEN EXPECTING AND ASKING FOR US TO DO. IT'S  NOT WHAT THE 22 NEIGHBORS WHO CAME HERE THE OTHER DAY TO TELL US ABOUT IT ASKED US TO DO. AND I THINK IT'S DEEPLY  REGRETTABE . AND I URGE US TO SAVE THESE TREES FROM THE  1700S. 
04:58:06.921: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN. 
04:58:08.623: >> THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. I WANT TO BE SURE TO RESPOND TO  THE 3 POINTS I JUST HEARD.  FIRST WITH RESPECT TO SAVING TREES, AGAIN, WE HAD A  COMPROMISE PLAN IN FRONT OF US THAT SAVED THE MOST PRECIOUS  OF ALL OF THEM. THE ONES THAT HAVE BEEN THERE BEFORE. THIS IS FORM LAND IN 1950 1930 AND 50S. SECOND WITH RESPECT TO-- I ALSO THINK WITH RESPECT TO THE SCHOOL BOND, A LOT OF THE  STUFF IS FOR GREEN IMPROVEMENT. I WANT TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE  AREN'T CONFUSED ABOUT THAT.  AND THEN ALSO-- THE HOUR'S LATE. THERE'S ANOTHER POINT--  THE EQUITY. YOU KNOW, WE ARE INVESTING TO PLAN A THOUSAND  NEW STREET TREES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD ACROSS THE CITY REGARDLESS OF ZIP CODE OR INCOME AND PURPOSELY DISTRIBUTING  T  THEM TO MAKE SURE THERE'S EQUITY IN OUR TREE EQUITY REGARDLESS OF ZIP CODE AND INCOME. FURTHERMORE THIS IS A  NEIGHBORO OD THAT IS POSITIONED SCALE BETWEEN POSITIONED SQUARELY BETWEEN THE THREE  LARGEST PARKS. A LOT OF ACCESS TO RECREATION, A LOT OF TREE  CANOPY. WE WANT TO PROTECT THE MOST PRECIOUS. WE WANT TO  C COME PR  COMPROMISE THE SOLUTION. THE 4. 7 IS TOO HIGH A PRAISE.  $3MILLION IS STILL A HIGH PRICE. LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS. 
04:59:45.420: >> COUNCILMEMBER GRAND.
04:59:47.121: >> COUNCILMEMBER ACKERMAN MADE MY POINT OF TREE EQUITY AND CANOPY. I BELIEVE THAT I'M A COUNCILMEME R WHO VOTES HOW I  SAY I'M GOING TO VOTE. I DON'T LIE TO APPEASE CONSTIU ENTS. AND I'M PLEASED TO MEET THAT EXPECTATION OF YOURS. 
05:00:06.941: >> FURTHER DISCUSSION? [ROLL CALL]-- [VOTING]. 
05:00:15.049: >> I'M SORRY, COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
05:00:19.520: >> WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN THE LATEST VERSION OF THE RESOLUTION. DOES IT INCLUDE THE $3 MILLION? 
05:00:27.762: >> ON THE $3 MILLION.

05:00:39.273: >> MOTION FAILED. 
05:01:02.930: >> IS THERE A MOTION TO REOPEN THE AGENDA? 
05:01:09.537: >> YES.
