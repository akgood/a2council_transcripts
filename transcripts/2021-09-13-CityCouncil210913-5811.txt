00:20:06.901: >> HI, M MY NAME IS TINA OLISON, I'M WITH THE HURON RIVER GROUP. I WILL BE CALLING ON THE COUNCILMEMBERS AND MAYOR IN THE ORDER THAT I KNEE YOU RAISE YOUR HANDS AND THEN BRIAN WILL BE LEADING THE RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS. THE FIRST ONE UP IS COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
00:20:27.088: >> Councilmember Hayner: THANKS. AND THANKS FOR PUTTING THIS PRESENTATION TOGETHER. I WAS NOT ON COUNCIL UNTIL 2015 BUT I REMEMBER READING THE STUDY AT THE TIME AND IT SEEMED PRETTY THOROUGH AND CONCLUSIVE THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO MAKE THESE LARGE INVESTMENTS IN OUR SYSTEM AND CONTINUE TO MAKE THESE INVESTMENTS. SO JUST A COUPLE OF QUICK QUESTIONS. WOULD THE CONC CONCEPTUAL DESIGF THE MAP, WE TALKED ABOUT SMALL CHANGES THAT MAYP OUR 22 MILON GALLONS TO DATE TO 25 MILLION GALLONS P DAY OF THAT PLANT. ARE WE GOINGO BE STUDYING OPONS  THA SITE TT MAXIMI O GALNS A DAY CAPACITY WITHHIS PROPOL AT'S DESIGNED, THIS SCHEME? IT SEEMS LE WE SHOULD G FOR THLARGEST SYSTEM. IF W SEE A L OF GROWTH, SCIO HAS GROWTH AND THE TOWNSHIPS AND SO ON AND SO FORTH. I WONDERED IF THAT WAS THE CONSIDERED OPTION OR ARE WE LEAVING IT TO YOU GUYS TO DETERMINE WHAT THE CHANGES ARE FOR PROSPECTIVE PLANT CHANGES.
00:21:30.551: >> WE WILL EVALUATE SIZE, FOR SURE AS A PART OF THIS AND THE INTENT IS TO HIT -- BASED ON OUR FUTURE PROJECTED DEMANDS ARE AND CAPACITY FOR THE CITY T SIT THAT SWEET SPOT. SO THERE'S PROS TO MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN BE ABLE TO DELIVER SAYING WHAT OUR 90 PERCENTILE DEMAND, IS BUT YOU DON'T ALSO WANT TO OVER DESIGN IT. SO WE WOULD BE HITTING THAT SWEET SPOT WITH THIS -- WITH THIS PROPOSAL.
00:21:59.547: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I SEE THAT GWLA PROVIDED FLINT AREA. I GUESS OUR COSTS WOULD BE SIMILAR TO THEIR GOVERNMENTS AS FAR AS BASED ON DISTANCE. ONE THING THAT IS NOT IN THERE -- I MEAN IT'S SOMEWHAT IN THERE AND I APPRECIATE IT, IF WE ARE THE FOUR GWLA PLANTS IF OURS IS COMING TO THE LOWEST DOWN RIVER ONES. THEY MAY HAVE TO HUSTLE AND CUT OFF THE INTAKE AND, YOU KNOW WOULD GETS THAT PRIORITY IN THAT ORGANIZATION? SO, I MEAN, THAT WILL HAPPEN IF WE MOVE FORWARD. I THINK BETWEEN THIS AND OUR CONVERSATION THAT WE HAD AND THANKS FOR HAVING THAT MEETING A COUPLE OF MONTHS BACK. I GOT THE IDEA THAT WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO INVEST IN OUR CURRENT ARE FACILITY.
00:22:59.307: >> NEXT UP IS COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
00:23:03.044: >> Counc
00:23:04.045: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. AND THANK YOU FOR BRINGING US THIS INFORMATION HERE TONIGHT. I HAVE A QUESTION ON HOW MUCH FURTHER WE ARE GOING TO NEED TO INVEST IN OUR WATER TREATMENT PLANT YOU DISCUSSED. YOU HAVE TWO DIFFERENT PLANTS ONE MORE MODERN THAN THE OTHER. WE -- HOW LONG DOES PLANT TWO HAVE LEFT TO IT? IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE WE HAVE 100 YEARS LEFT ON IT. MY CONCERN IS THAT WE ARE NOT NECESSARILY GETTING THE BOTTOM LINE WITH JUST REPLACING PLANT ONE, BECAUSE THERE ARE GOING TO BE FUTURE COSTS IN THE REST OF THE FACILITY AT A LATER TIME. SO DO WE KNOW WHAT THAT WOULD GO COST SO THAT WE ARE COMPARING APPLES TO APPLES IN TERMS OF COMPLETE AND TOTAL WATER SYSTEM IF THAT MAKES SENSE TO YOU. I THINK JUST REPLACING ONE PART OF THE PLANT IS NOT NECESSARILY REPLACING THE WHOLE THING. SO WE CAN GET A TOTAL COST.
00:24:12.413: >> THE 2015 STUDY DOES HAVE SOME DATA ON THE COST TO FOR REPLACING THE OTHER COSTS AS WELL. I DON'T HAVE THE NUMBERS AT ANY FINGERTIPS BUT WE CAN COMMUNICATE BACK OUT AFTER THIS MEETING AND SHARE THOSE WITH YOU IF THAT'S SOMETHING YOU ARE INTERESTED IN.
00:24:28.929: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: YES, PLEASE.
00:24:31.065: >> THERMS OF THE TIMING, OUR -- INTENTION IS TO RIGHT SIZE ANY IMPROVEMENTS TO PLANT ONE SO IT WOULD HIT THE SWEET SPOT OF WHAT WE WOULD NEED IN 90% OF THE DAYS OF THE CALENDAR YEAR AND THEN YOU HAVE PLANT TWO, WHICH IS NOW OUR MAIN PLANT AS SORT OF THE BACKUP. SO IT COULD BE REHABILITATED AND NOT BE REPLACED AND BE ABLE TO SERVE SEVERAL MORE DECADES FOR SURE. I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT, AS FAR AS WHAT MAKES SENSE. WE MAY NOT HAVE TO DO A COMPLETE REPLACEMENT, AFTER PLANT ONE IS PREPLACED.
00:25:17.578: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. AND IF THERE'S STILL TIME TO ASK A FOLLOW-UP QUESTION, WITH THE CONTAMINATION THAT LOOMS AND THREATENED OUR DRINKING WATER, WHETHER THE PROPOSED PLANT REPLACE IS GOING TO -- DOES THAT $108 MILLION INCLUDE ANY TYPE OF TECHNOLOGY OR EQUIPMENT TO TREAT DIOXANE IF THAT UNFORTUNATE EVENT OCCURS.
00:25:45.806: >> THAT D DOES NOT INCLUDE DIOXE TREATMENT, THAT $108 MILLION.
00:25:52.947: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  DO WE HAVE ANY IDEA ON WHAT THAT ADDITIONAL CAPABILITY WOULD COST TO INCLUDE IN THIS 100-YEAR.
00:26:06.694: >> WE HAVE SOME NUMBERS THAT WERE PUT TOGETHER TEN YEARS AGO. WE CAN SHARE THAT ALSO WITH COUNCIL BEFORE THE NEXT PLEATING.
00:26:19.639: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: -- MEETING.
00:26:22.442: >> Councilmember Ramlawi:  IF YOU WOULD, PLEASE. THANK YOU.
00:26:25.112: >> NEXT UP IS COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
00:26:27.848: >> Councilmember Griswold: THANK YOU FOR A VERY PROFESSIONAL PRESENTATION. I APPRECIATE THAT YOU ARE BEING PROACTIVE. I'M TRYING TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW THIS PROCESS INITIATED AND WHAT THE COSTS-TO-DATE ARE. I'M A MEMBER OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION. I DON'T REMEMBER THIS TOPIC BEING DISCUSSED OR INITIATED BY THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION. I COULD BE WRONG.
00:26:58.746: >> LET ME SEE IF EYE UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTION. ARE WE TALKING ABOUT THE PROCESS FOR THESE TWO ALTERNATIVES AND BRING IT TO COUNCIL FOR CONSIDERATION?
00:27:07.688: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES. WHEN DID THAT INITIATE?
00:27:10.758: >> WE DID THIS ALTERNATIVE ANALYSIS BACK IN, YOU KNOW, 2015, AND WE PRESENTED TO COUNCIL AT THAT POINT. AND THE RECOMMENDATION WAS TO PROCEED WITH IMPROVING THE WATER TREATMENT PLANT. BECAUSE OF SEVERAL OTHER I SORT OF WENT THROUGH THE OTHER PROJECTED THAT HAVE COME UP IN THE INTERIM, THAT HAVE DELAYED THE INITIATION OF THIS PROJECT. SO THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN IN THE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PLANT FOR MANY YEARS AND, YOU KNOW, IT HAD SURFACED AND THEN WE COMPLETED OUR STUDY. WE SHARED THAT WITH COUNCIL AND WE HAD INTENDED TO CONTINUE ON THE PROCESS, HOWEVER THERE WERE OTHER TH THINGS -- WE THOUGHT IT MADE SENSE TO BRING IT BACK TO COUNCIL, AND IT MADE SENSE TO BRING IT BACK AFTER SIX YEARS.
00:28:17.424: >> Councilmember Griswold: AND WOULD YOU RECOMMEND THAT BEFORE IT COMES BACK TO COUNCIL WITH THE RESOLUTIONS THAT IT GO TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION FOR SOME ADVICE? ONE OF THE REASONS I'M ASKING THAT IS I RECEIVED TWO COMMUNICATIONS FROM -- WELL, ONE FROM DAN BICKNELL, AND ANOTHER FROM A PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MISCH MUSH IDENTIFYING THE -- MICHIGAN IDENTIFYING THE RISK AND THE CONCERNS AND GETTING THE WATER FROM THE GREAT LAKES WATER COMMISSION. AND GIVEN THAT OUR WATER SOURCE IS BELOW THE RIVER OUTLET AND THE LENGTH AND DISTANCE THAT OUR WATER WOULD TRAVELED IN A PIPE WOULD REQUIRE ADDITIONAL TREATMENT. AND THEN THE ANALYSIS FROM 2020, SHOWS THAT THE LEAD LEVEL IN THE GREAT LAKES WATER AUTHORITY SAMPLING IN YPSILANTI, THE LEAD LEVEL IS NINE TIMES WHAT IT IS IN OUR ANN ARBOR WATER. I AGREE IT'S EXTREMELY TECHNICAL AND I'M WONDERING IF IT WOULD BENEFIT FROM THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION WEIGHING IN BEFORE WE SPEND ADDITIONAL MONEY. AND THE LAST QUESTION IS REGAREGARDING CONTINGENCY PLANN. AND COULD MORE WELLS HAVE BEEN EVALUATED IN THE PAST?
00:29:59.059: >> BRIAN, BEFORE YOU ANSWER, IF IT'S HELPFUL, WE CAN DO A BRIEFING FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION AND WHEN WE BRING RESOLUTIONS TO CITY COUNCIL, THE COUNCIL CAN REFER THEM TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION AT THAT TIME IF THEY WOULD LIKE.
00:30:09.870: >> Councilmember Griswold: OKAY. THANKS. I JUST SEE THAT A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF ST STAFF RESOURCES AND FUNDS HAVE BEEN DEVOTED TO THIS, BUT I'M WONDERING IF WE CAN IMPROVE THE PROCESS.
00:30:23.751: >> CERTAINLY. THANK YOU. BRIAN?
00:30:26.220: >> Councilmember Griswold: YOU'RE WELCOME.
00:30:27.955: >> SO JOHN ADDRESSED THE COMMENT ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION. CAN YOU ASK ME ABOUT THE OTHER QUESTION? OH, WELLS.
00:30:44.771: >> Councilmember Griswold: FOR A SIN CONTINGENCY PLAN. NOT NECESSARILY ALTERNATIVE WELLS BUT JUST CONTINGENCY.
00:30:56.049: >> LET ME GIVE THAT SOME THOUGHT. WE HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL WELLS INCORPORATED INTO OUR CAPITAL IMPROVPROVEMENT PLAN. SO AT THIS POINT, OUR PLAN -- OUR CURRENT PLAN IS TO BUILD UP OUR WELL CAPACITY IN ORDER TO MEET WHAT THE PLAN IS CURRENTLY DESIGNED TO PRODUCE, WHICH IS 10 MILLION GALLONS PER DAY OF WELL WATER. WHETHER IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO TRY TO AUGMENT OR NOT, THAT'S PART OF FUTURE PLANS AND WE HAVE TO GIVE MORE THOUGHT. I DON'T REALLY HAVE THO THOUGHTR THAT AT THIS PARTICULAR TIME.
00:31:40.293: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I DIDN'T EXPECT YOU TO ANSWER.
00:31:43.263: >> AND ON THE QUESTION OF LEAD, BRIAN CAN CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG, BUT MUCH OF THE LEAD THAT IS SAMPLING IS A LOCAL PROBLEM. THE REASON THAT ANN ARBOR HAS LOW LEAD NUMBERS IS WE VIRTUALLY NO LEAD LEFT IN OUR SYSTEM.
00:32:09.189: >> Councilmember Griswold: OKAY.
00:32:10.124: >> THAT'S CORRECT. SO THE COURSE OF THE LEAD IS TYPICALLY CUSTOMER SITE PLUMBING. SO IT'S NOT COMING FROM THE PLANT. SO REALLY THE QUESTION IN DETETERMSOF WATER SUPPLY. IS DETROIT WATER MORE CORROSIVE THAN ANN ARBOR WATER? AND COULD THAT IMPACT CURRENT WATER SERVICE. WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF PLANS FOR REMOVING ALL OF THOSE. SO IN ANN ARBOR, WE ARE HOPING FOR THE NEXT TEN YEARS TO HAVE ALL THE SOURCES OF LEAD REMOVED.
00:32:56.103: >> Councilmember Griswold: THANKS.
00:32:57.971: >> NEXT UP IS COUNCILMEMBER BRIGGS.
00:32:59.840: >> Councilmember Briggs: THANK YOU. AND THANKS FOR THE PROCESS THAT WE ARE GOING THROUGH HERE. I APPRECIATED THE TOUR OF THE WATER TREATMENT PLANT AND THE WORKING SESSION AND THE PRESENTATION TT MAKES A COMPLICATED SUBJECT PRETTY EASY TO FOLLOW. SOHANK YOU. ANDSPECIALLY THIS COR-CED COMPARON CHA. I DIDAVE O QSTION O THE SLIDE,HE RISK  SOUE WATER QUALITY WHERE ANN ARBOR IS REHABBING THE CITY' WER TRTMENT PLANT IS RATED AS YELLOW MEANING MEDIUM RISK IMPACT AND THEEGIONAL GREAT LAKES IS LOWER RISK AND SO I CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT THE RISKS ARE -- I WAS WONDER -- YOU MENTIONED YOU COULD SPEAK MORE TO WHAT WENT INTO THIS ASSESSMENT. I CAN IMAGINE WHAT WENT INTO THE DIOXANE PLUME AND THE GREAT LAKES WATER AUTHORITY AND THE DETROIT RIVER. WHAT LED THAT TO BE A LOWER RISK, GIVEN SOME OF THE INDUSTRIAL POLLUTANTS IN THAT AREA.
00:34:11.945: >> I WILL SEE IF BOB GREEN CAN JUMP IN AND ADDRESS THAT QUESTION.
00:34:22.222: >> YES, THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. AND GENERALLY SPEAKING, WHILE MOST OF THE SUPPLY WOULD COME TO ANN ARBOR FROM EITHER THEIR BELL ISLE INTAKE, WHICH IS AT THE HEAD OF THE BELL ISLE WHICH IS AT THE MOUTH OF THE DETROIT RIVER. THAT INTAKE SITS INSIDE OF A BIT OF A PROTECTED HARBOR, IF YOU WILL. WELL, IT'S KIND OF INTERESTING BECAUSE THE RIVER ALMOST TURNS EAST AND WEST THERE AT BELL ISLE AND SO IT'S KIND OF SITTING ON THE NORTH SORT OF THE ISLAND SO TO SPEAK. THE OTHER INTAKE IS THE FIGHTING ISLAND INTAKE WHICH IS A LITTLE FARTHER TO THE SOUTH. THE VOLUME OF WATER THAT FLOWS THROUGH AND FROM PRIOR SAMPLING, YOU KNOW, OVER THE YEARS AND I ACTUALLY HAD SPENT A NUMBER OF YEARS THE MDEQ COVERING THE SOUTHEAST MICHIGAN AREA AS THE SUPERVISOR FOR DRINKING WATER. SO SAMPLING FOR W PESTICIDES, AO ORGANICS AND IT'S GENERALLY RESPECTED, YOU KNOW, AS A VERY CLEAN WATER. OBVIOUSLY SOME SEDIMENTS IN THE BOTTOM OF THE RIVER THAT RARELY GET, YOU KNOW, DISTURBED. IT MIGHT CAUSE CONCERN, BUT THE WIND TYPICALLY COMES FROM THE WEST -- OR NORTH AND LOWS TOWARDS THE EAST. AND SO GENERALLY SPEAKING WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE CORRIDOR WITH THE NEIGHBORS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE RIVER, THE INTERNATIONAL BOUNDARY HAS NOT PROVEN ITSELF TO AFFECT EITHER OF THESE TWO INTAKES. SO JUST FROM MY OWN PERSPECTIVE, FROM MY CAREER, THE INTAKES THAT ARE MOST LIKELY TO PROVIDE WATER TO ANN ARBOR HAVEN'T REALLY DEMONSTRATED THEMSELVES TO BE TOO VULNERABLE TO CONTAMINATION. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT HELPS OR ANSWERS WHAT YOU ARE ASKING.
00:36:44.798: >> Councilmember Briggs: IT DOES, THANK YOU.
00:36:48.368: >> IT'S A LITTLE BIT -- I WILL ADD TO BOB'S COMMENT. IT'S A LITTLE BIT SUBJECTIVE WHEN WE ARE DEALING WITH SOURCE WATER. YOU LOOK AT THE HURON RIVER WHICH, IS YOU KNOW, AN INLAND RIVER WITH FAIRLY SUBSTANTIAL DEVELOPMENT, AGO ARE I CULTURE AND WE HAVE SOME KNOWN CONTAMINANTS THAT WE ARE ALREADY DEALING WITH. I THINK THAT WAS THE REASON THAT IT WAS RECOGNIZED AS BEING A LITTLE BIT HIGHER RISK THAN THE DETROIT SYSTEM. WE JUST HAPPEN TO HAVE SOME KNOWN EMERGING CONTAMINANT ISSUES AND THEY DON'T AT THIS POINT IN TIME.
00:37:26.506: >> OKAY. COUNCILMEMBER SONG, YOU ARE NEXT UP.
00:37:30.143: >> Councilmember Song: HI, EVERYONE. I WAS READING UP ON HOW JACKSON AND TRAVERSE CITY HAVE ALREADY GONE DOWN THIS PATH AND HAVE APPROVED UPDATES TO THEIR WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANTS BACK IN APRIL AND MAY. AND THERE WAS SOME MENTION ABOUT MICHIGAN CLEAN WATER STATE REVOLVING FUND LOAD. IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WE ARE LOOKING INTO TOO? OR THAT WE WOULD QUALIFY FOR?
00:37:53.099: >> SO OUR PLANS INCORPORATE -- REGARDLESS OF WHICH ALTERNATIVE WE PURSUE AND BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF THIS POTENTIAL INVESTMENT, WE WOULD BE LOOKING AT WHETHER IT'S STATE REVOLVING OR FEDERAL PROGRAMS. THERE'S SOME FEDERAL PROGRAMS THAT MAY BE MORE LUCRATIVE, THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR WATER AND WASTEWATER IMPROVEMENTS, ONE OF THEM IS CALLED WIFIA AND IT'S WHERE YOU CAN -- A COMMUNITY LIKE ANN ARBOR COULD BORROW DIRECTLY FROM THE U.S. TREASURY. SO INCORPORATING LOAN PROGRAMS AND POTENTIALLY SEARCHING FOR GRANT OPPORTUNITIES WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY INCORPORATED IN WHICHEVER OF THE ALTERNATIVES THAT WE PURSUED.
00:38:31.037: >> Councilmember Song: AN THEN A FOLLOW-UP QUESTION, ARE -- CAN YOU SPEAK A LITTLE BIT TO HOW THE ENGAGEMENT MIGHT LOOK LIKE AFTER THIS PASSES COUNCIL? I MEAN, WE HAVE A NEW EQUITABLE ENGAGEMENT. I'M WONDERING WHERE IN THE PROCESS THEY WOULD BE ENGAGED AND MAYBE THIS IS MORE FOR JOHN. OR MAYBE BRIAN?
00:38:56.930: >> WE CAN CERTAINLY PLUG IN SOME OF THE RESOURCES FROM INITIAL EQUITABLE ENGAGEMENT. I WOULD CALL THAT INITIATIVE IN COATE AT THIS POINT BUT THERE ARE CERTAINLY LESSONS THAT WE CAN APPLY.
00:39:09.843: >> AND WE HAVE BUILT INTO THE BUDGET A PRETTY ROBUST -- I MEAN, THIS IS A PRETTY TRANSFORMATIVE PROJECT, RIGHT? WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE WATER SYSTEM FOR THE COMMUNITY, FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL GENERATIONS. SO WE HAVE SPENT A FAIR BIT OF TIME LOOKING AT HOW WE ARE GOING TO ENGAGE AND IT'S PART OF OUR SCOPE OF WORK AND WE CAN ALSO SHARE THAT SCOPE OF WORK WITH YOU. I DON'T, AGAIN, HAVE IT COMMITTED TO MEMORY BUT THE HURON RIVER GROUP WOULD BE LEADING THAT EFFORT AND WE WOULD BE PRETTY AGGRESSIVE IN TERMS OF TRYING TO REACH THE BROADER COMMUNITY AND INCORPORATE THEIR FEEDBACK INTO THE PROCESS.
00:39:53.653: >> Councilmember Song: THANK YOU BOTH.
00:39:54.855: >> NEXT UP IS COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
00:39:57.056: >> Councilmember Hayner:  IF MY COUNCIL COLLEAGUE WANTS TO GO FIRST BECAUSE THIS WILL BE MY SECOND TIME AROUND. I WILL DEFER TO COUNCILMEMBER DISCH.
00:40:04.497: >> ALL RIGHT. COUNCILMEMBER DISCH.
00:40:09.903: >> Councilmember Disch: THANK YOU. MY QUESTIONS ARE NOT URGENT, BUT THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT OF DISCUSSION ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMISSION OF THIS AND I REMEMBER THAT ONE COMMISSIONER ASKED WHETHER THERE COULD BE A HYBRID OPTION AND I WANTED MR. STEGLITZ TO SPEAK TO THAT. I KNOW YOU EXPLAINED THIS TO ME, BUT YOU EXPLAIN IT BETTER THAN I DO, OBVIOUSLY. AND I WONDER IF YOU COULD SAY A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT SOME OF THE RESEARCH THAT YOU ARE CONDUCTING AT THE WATER TREATMENT PLANT AND HOW THAT HELPS US REALLY STAY AHEAD OF OTHER CITIES IN PROVIDING HIGH QUALITY WATER. SHOO SURE. SO YOUR FIRST QUESTION WAS -- OH, SORRY.
00:41:03.055: >> Councilmember Disch: IT WAS --
00:41:04.324: >> THE HYBRID APPROACH.
00:41:05.992: >> Councilmember Disch: HYBRID, YEAH, YEAH.
00:41:07.560: >> I LOST CONNECTIVITY THERE FOR A SECOND, I'M SORRY. SO HYBRID APPROACH, COULD WE BLEND SOURCES, GET SOME WATER OR HAVE WATER BE CONNECTED TO A REGIONAL WATER SUPPLY AND -- AS A BACKUP POTENTIALLY TO OUR WATER SYSTEM? WATER QUALITIES ARE NOTACE, THE- COMPATIBLE, THE CITY'S WATER QUALITY AND THE GREAT LAKES REGIONAL WATER. WE WOULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT TASTE AND ODOR ISSUES IF WE CONNECTED THE CITY'S COUNT WATER SYSTEM TO THE GREAT LAKES WATER AUTHORITY. IT WOULD NOT BE IMPOSSIBLE BUT WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO BE SORT OF FLIPPING BACK AND FORTH. WE WOULD NEED TO -- YOU NEED TO PICK ONE OR THE OTHER. WE HAVE DECIDED WE ARE USING CURRENTLY AS OUR SECONDARY DISINFECTANT, MONO CHLOROMINE, IT LASTS A LONG TIME AND IT'S VERY PERSISTENT AND IT CONTROLS DISINFECTANT BYPRODUCTS. FOR US, WITH OUR SOURCE WATER, IT'S THE RIGHT FIT. GREAT LAKES USES A DIFFERENT DISINFECTANT AND IT HAS DIFFERENT PROS AND CONS AND WE WOULD HAVE TO EVALUATE ALL OF THAT IF WE WERE BRINGING THEIR WATER IN OUR SYSTEM. WE WOULD ANTICIPATE THAT THIS WOULD BE A FAIR BIT OF TIME WHEN THERE WOULD BE WATER QUALITY THAT WE WOULD FACE, BUT IT'S NOT INSURMOUNTABLE. IT HAPPENS IN OTHER COMMUNITIES THAT MAKES THESE THANKS. THE PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT WOULD HAVE TO BE VERY, VERY EXTENSIVE BECAUSE WE PROBABLY WOULD BE GETTING A LOT OF CALLS ABOUT TASTE ODOR ISSUES IF WE MADE THAT TRANSITION. YOUR SECOND QUESTION WAS ABOUT RESEARCH. WE ARE PRETTY ACTIVE IN THE RESEARCH. WE HAVE SEEN SOME PROPOSALS THAT COME YOUR WAY ABOUT SOME GRANTS THAT WE APPLIED FOR, AND ANOTHER ONE THAT WE ARE WORKING ON RIGHT NOW, ACTUALLY, YOU WILL BE SEEING SHORTLY AND THE BENEFIT OF THIS IS WE -- ANN ARBOR, WE WANT TO BE THOUGHT OF AS SOLUTION ORIENTED. AS WE RUN INTO WATER QUALITY CHALLENGES, PFAS IS AN EXAMPLE. WE WERE ONE THE FIRST UTILITIES TO TAKE THIS ON. ONE IS TO COMMUNICATE TO OUR CUSTOMERS ABOUT IT, WHICH MANY UTILITIES WERE NOT DOING. EVEN WHEN WE DIDN'T HAVE THE ANSWERS WE WERE TRYING TO BE TRANSPARENT WITH THE DATA. WE HAVE PUT OUT A MONTHLY WATER QUALITY REPORT. WE ARE REPORTING ON SOME OF THESE EMERGING CONTAMINANT LEVELS EVERY MONTH WHICH IS WELL BEYOND WHAT ANY OF THE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS WOULD NEED OR REQUIRE US TO DO. BUT WE HAVE ALSO DONE RESEARCH ON LOOKING AT, YOU KNOW HO CAN WE REMOVE SOME -- HOW CAN WE REMOVE SOME OF THESE CONTAMINANTS THAT ARE NOT REGULATED. WE HAVE WATER QUALITY GOALS THAT WE ESTABLISH FOR OUR OWN COMMUNITY WELL BEFORE, YOU KNOW -- YOU KNOW, 18 MONTHS, TWO YEARS BEFORE THE STATE EVEN REGULATED THESE. SO, YOU KNOW, THAT SORT OF GOES TO THIS ISSUE OF AUTONOMY. WE ARE ABLE TO REFLECT THE INTERESTS AND THE DEMANDS OF OUR CUSTOMERS, WHICH IN ANN ARBOR, I THINK, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE A VERY EDUCATED COMMUNITY AND PEOPLE FEEL VERY STRONGLY ABOUT US SORT OF GOING BEYOND THE MINIMUM. AND HAVING CONTROL OF OUR WATER SYSTEM AND PARTICIPATING IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTING THESE THINGS BEFORE THEY ARE REGULATED IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE BEEN FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO DO AND FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO HAVE YOUR SUPPORT FOR HISTORICALLY. SO DID THAT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, COUNCILMEMBER DISCH ABOUT RESEARCH?
00:45:07.366: >> BOB GREEN, DID YOU HAVE SOMETHING YOU WANTED TO ADD.
00:45:09.368: >> I WANTED TO ADD THAT THERE'S CONTRACTUAL RESTRICTION IN THE MODEL CONTRACT FROM GLWA THAT WOULD PROHIBIT BRENTING THEIR WATT -- BLENDING THEIR WATER WI ANOTHER COMMUNITY WATER. IF IT WAS STRICTLY BACKUP NNECTION THAT WOULDECOME A CO ANALYSI YOUREN A DIR EMERGENCY. JU WANTED TO MAKE TT POIN THANK YOU.
00:45:52.812: >> COUNCICOUNCILMEMBER HAYNER.
00:45:56.716: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I GOT A LETTER, THEY HAD A2 CITIZENS FOR CLEANER WATER. I WISHED I COULD HAVE REACHED OUT TO THEM BUT THIS WAS NO RETURN ADDRESS AND NOTHING. THEY SAID COULD THEY HAVE THEIR OWN REGIONAL AUTHORITY. THEY THOUGHT WE WERE A MUNICIPAL AUTHORITY AND THAT'S A FINE LINE. I DON'T THINK WE HAVE THE VOLUME TO BE A REGIONAL AUTHORITY TO BRING IN YPSI, BUT I WANT TO THROW IT OUT THERE BECAUSE THEY HAD REACHED OUT IT AND PLEASE EMAIL ME AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT IT SOME MORE. THE 1, 2, DIOXANE WHEN WE PLAN OUR NEW PLANT, A ASSUME WE WILL LEAVE SPACE TO POTENTIALLY HAVE ROOM FOR THAT IN THE FUTURE, EITHER EXCESS WIRING, PLUMBING, FITTING SO WE CAN DIVERT THAT THROUGH WHATEVER THE PREFERRED CHEMISTRY PART OF THE TRAINING IS? I GUESS MY QUESTION IS ARE WE GOING TO LEAVE SPACE IN THE TREATMENT PLANT FOR THAT. AND ABOUT OUR LED AND COPPER RULES, I KNOW WE ARE AHEAD ON THAT AS WE REPLACE THE MEETINGS AND AGGRESSIVELY REPLACING ANY POTENTIALLY SUSPICIOUS LEAD OR COPPER INPUTS INTO OUR SYSTEM. I WOULD ASSUME WITH GLWA, LIKE, WOULD WE BE -- LIKE, RATES HAVE TO BE A COST OF SERVICE IN OUR STATE, AND SO THEIR RATES COULD POTENTIALLY FLUCTUATE DEPENDING ON WHERE THEY ARE IN THE LED AND COPPER SYSTEM. IS EACH COMMUNITY RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS LEAD AND COPPER DEALINGS OR IS -- IS -- SORRY ABOUT THAT. IS -- IS THAT THE WATER SYSTEM'S RESPONSIBILITY? AND THEN ONE MORE QUICK ONE AFTER THAT.
00:47:52.398: >> SO REGARDING LEAD AND COPPER, THAT IS THE -- COMPLIANCE IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE -- OF THE CUSTOMER. SO IN OUR CASE, THAT WOULD BE ANN ARBOR. SO EACH OF THE COMMUNITIES WHO ARE CUSTOMERS OF THE GREAT LAKES WATER AUTHORITY HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE LEAD AND COPPER RULES. THEY ARE THE ONES MANAGING THEIR DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM AND THIS IS A DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM ISSUE. SO I'M SURE THAT THERE'S SOME PARTNERSHIP COMPONENTS ALSO, BUT, YOU KNOW, WE WOULD, INDEED -- OUR RATES WOULDN'T BE FUNDING LEAD AND COPPER COMPLIANCE FROM ANOTHER MEMBER UTILITY OF THE GREAT LAKES WATER AUTHORITY. SO OUR RATES -- OUR RATES WOULD BE -- WE WOULD BE GETTING RAW WATER -- NOT RAW WATER, BUT TREATED WATER AND THEN THE RATES WOULD HAVE TO BUILD IN OUR OWN LEAD AND COPPER COMPLIANCE, AS WELL AS MANAGING OUR DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM AND THINGS LIKE THAT. SO.
00:48:52.592: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I APPRECIATE THAT. IF WE START SCORING THINGS IN A MATRIX AND ONE OF THEM IS THE CONTRIBUTION TO EQUITY GOALS, YOU KNOW, I'M NOT SURE THAT HELPING DETROIT PAY FOR THEIR WATER WOULD COUNT AS A CONTRIBUTION TO THE GENERAL EQUITY OF THE SOUTHEAST MICHIGAN. IT'S KIND OF IFFY. SO TWO MORE QUICK QUESTIONS. ONE IS PROBABLY A YES OR NO DO WE DO ANNUAL QUALITY OR POLLUTANT TESTING ON OUR OWN WATER OR INBOUND OR OUTBOUND WATER, YOU KNOW PRE OR POST FINISH, I GUESS? AND THE SECOND QUESTION IS THIS ALL BUBBLED UP AND IT'S BEEN STATED A COUPLE OF TIMES THAT AT LEAST ONE COUNCILMEMBER HAS ASKED FOR THIS. DOES ANYBODY WANT TO TAKE CREDIT FOR ASKING FOR THIS GLWA SURVEY? WHAT -- WHAT'S SPURNED THIS INTEREST AFTER THE 250 GRAND WE PAID FOR THE 2015 REPORT. THAT LAID IT OUT PRETTY CLEARLY. DOES ANYONE WANT TO LET ME KNOW WHAT THE GLWA ISSUE IS? WHAT SPURNED THIS? IT WASN'T ME.
00:50:01.193: >> SO I WILL -- I GUESS AIL DRESS YOUR OTHER QUESTIONS FIRST AND THEN I WILL TURN IT BACK OVER TO TINA. YOU ASKED FIRST ABOUT DIOXANE TREATMENT. SO WE WOULD ABSOLUTELY -- CAN YOU HEAR ME? WE WOULD ABSOLUTELY BE LOOKING AT, YOU -- YOU KNOW AS PART OF THE CAPITAL PLAN IF WE REHABILITATE THE WATER PLANT, WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE WELL POSITIONED TO DEAL WITH WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT OR MAY HAVE TOTALS TL WITH OVER THE NEXT 20 YEARS. THINKING THROUGH WHAT WE WOULD HAVE TO DO AT SOME POINT TREAT FOR 1, 4, DIOXANE, THAT WOULD BE PART OF THE PLAN. IT MAKES NO SENSE TO BUILD THAT UNLESS IT WAS NEEDED. SO, YOU KNOW, AS YOU SAID, WE SORT OF -- WE CONSIDER IT PLUG AND PLAY, WHERE WE WOULD HAVE THE CAPABILITY AND THE SPACE DEDICATED IF FOR SOME REASON THIS WAS NEEDED. BUT IT WOULD NOT BE BUILT UNTIL IT WAS NEEDED, BECAUSE IT MAKES NO SENSE TO MAKE THAT INVESTMENT IF IT'S -- IF IT'S NOT NEEDED. YOUR OTHER QUESTION WAS ABOUT POLLUTANTS AND I SORT OF LOST YOU FOR A SECOND BUT I THINK YOU WERE ASKING ABOUT, YOU KNOW, DO WE TEST FOR CERTAIN POLLUTANTS?
00:51:11.663: >> Councilmember Hayner:  I WONDER IF WE DO THE PRIORITY POLLUTANTS TEST AND I KNOW THERE'S A TEST THAT RUNS THOSE HOWEVER MANY HUNDREDS THERE IS. I WONDER IF THAT'S A TEST THAT WE DO ANNUALLY OR QUARTERLY.
00:51:25.544: >> THAT TERM PRIORITY POLLUTANTS DOESN'T RING A BELL FOR ME. I'M NOT SURE IF SOMEONE ELSE ON OUR TEAM CAN -- I CAN LOOK IN THAT IF NO ONE ELSE HAS AN ANSWER. I'M NOT SURE IF THAT'S ON THE DRINKING WATER SIDE OR MAYBE ON THE CLEAN WATER SIDE. DOES ANYBODY -- ANYBODY FAMILIAR WITH THAT?
00:51:48.500: >> BRIAN, I NEVER HEARD IT CALLED PRIORITY POLLUTANTS BUT THERE IS -- I CAN ASK CAREEN -- THERE'S THE UCMR, THE UNREGULATED CONTAMINANTS THAT VARIOUS COMMUNITIES ARE ASKED TO MONITOR FOR, AND CAREEN, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING ADDITIONAL TO ADD TO THAT.
00:52:11.324: >> I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING ADDITIONAL TO ADD TO THAT.
00:52:14.126: >> Councilmember Hayner:  THEY CALLED IT A PRIORITY POLLUTANT LIST AND THEY HAVE A TOXIC POLLUTANT AND PRIORITY POLLUTANT SET AND THERE'S STANDARD TESTS THAT WATER AUTHORITIES CAN USE AND ANOTHER WAY TO SEE WHAT'S IN OUR WATER. WE CAN TALK ABOUT THIS OFFLINE, BRIAN.
00:52:30.476: >> WE MADE A NOTE AND WE WILL GET BACK TO YOU AND LET YOU KNOW. MY GUESS IS THAT THERE MAY SOMEBODY OVERLAP BETWEEN THAT LIST.
00:52:43.022: >> Councilmember Hayner:  IT'S A LOT OF ORGANICKEN CHLORINATED BENZENE.
00:52:51.930: >> AND MY GUESSES IS PROBLEMY THERE THE THINGS WE DO. WE DO OVER 100,000 TESTS ON THE DRINKING WATER EVERY YEAR. AND THERE'S DIFFERENT FREQUENCIES FOR DIFFERENT CONTAMINANTS AND SO IT'S A PRETTY ROBUST PROGRAM, BUT WE'LL GET A RESPONSE BACK TO YOU ON THIS PRIORITY POLLUTANT LIST.
00:53:09.248: >> NEXT UP IS COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
00:53:12.318: >> Councilmember Griswold: YES, WHEN WE TALK ABOUT 1, 4, DIOXANE, IT IS VERY SCARY, HOWEVER, BASIO BASED ON THE LATT RESEARCH, WE ARE AT LEAST 50 YEARS, IF NOT MORE, FROM EVEN THE RISK OF DIOXANE GETTING INTO THE SOURCE OF OUR DRINKING WATER. AND I WOULD SUGGEST THAT ANYONE THAT IS INTERESTED, JUST GOOGLE CARD AND YOU CAN GET INFORMATION ON THAT. THERE HAS BEEN DIOXANE IN THE NEWS REGARDING THE RISK OF VAPOR INTRUSION, BUT THAT'S NOT CONTAMINATION TO OUR SOURCE WATER. -- AND IT MADE TREMENDOUS IMPROVEMENTS IN THE LAST YEAR IN TERMS OF THE DIOXANE REMEDIATION IN ALL THE WORK THAT IS BEING DONE AND THE DUAL PATHS. I WON'T GO INTO DETAIL AND BORE EVERYONE -- [ NO AUDIO ] AND STAFF, THANK YOU TO MR. STEGLITZ AND HIS STAFF. AND SOMETIMES WE TAKE THAT FOR GRANTED. BUT IT IS -- FOR ME, IT'S AN EASY DECISION TO -- TO STAY WITH OUR ANN ARBOR DRINKING WATER. SO THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION.
00:54:42.340: >> THANK YOU.
00:54:48.013: >> I JUST RECEIVED A MESSAGE FROM ONE OF OUR PANELISTS WHO SAID THE PRIORITY POLLUTANT LIST IS A WASTEWATER THING AND SO THE CLEAN WATER SLIDE BUT WE CAN STILL TAKE A LOOK AT THAT COUNCILMEMBER HAYNER AND SEE -- AND GIVE YOU SOME FEEDBACK ON KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE ALSO TASTE FOR IN THE DRINKING WATER THAT PROBABLY OVERLAP WITH SOME ITEMS ON THAT LIST.
00:55:09.501: >> DID WE HAVE ANY OTHER COUNCILMEMBERS WHO HAD QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS? I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER HANDS UP. NO? OH, THERE WE GO. COUNCILMEMBER RAMLAWI.
00:55:27.720: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: THANK YOU. JUST GOING BACK TO A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS I HAD, WILL WE BE ABLE TO GET THAT INFORMATION BEFORE OR AT THE TIME THAT WE GET THIS CHOICE SENT TO COUNCIL AS TO WHAT PATH WE WOULD LIKE TO TAKE REGARDING PLANT TWO, THE COST OF MODERNIZING PLANT TWO AND THEN THE COST OF ADDING THE DIOXANE SO WE HAVE A TOTAL COST APPLES TO APPLES COMPARESON, AT LEAST FOR MYSELF ON THESE TWO PATHS.
00:56:05.491: >> I WOULD PROPOSE AND I WILL COORDINATE WITH MR. FOURNIER AND MR. HUPY THAT MAYBE WE ADDRESS THIS AS AN RFI AND WE CAN PULL SOME INFORMATION TOGETHER AND SEND IT BACK THROUGH THE RFI SYSTEM IF THAT'S -- IF THEY THINK THAT'S APPROPRIATE.
00:56:27.446: >> Councilmember Ramlawi: WHATEVER CHANNEL IS APPROPRIATE. I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MY COLLEAGUES ALSO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT THIS INFORMATION AND NOT JUST THE COUNCILMEMBER WHO REQUESTED IT.
00:56:40.459: >> I THINK THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION IS YES, AND WE WILL DETERMINE THE QUESTION AND FIGURE OUT TO GET THAT INFORMATION TO COUNCIL.
00:56:52.638: >> OKAY. ANYBODY ELSE?
00:56:59.611: >> HANDING THE MEETING BACK OVER TO THE MAYOR.

01:01:07.058: >> HI, MY NAME IS DAVE BICKNELL AND I'M PRESIDENT OF THE GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL ALLIANCE. LAST FRIDAY, I PROVIDED THE CITY COUNCIL WITH THE GEA REVIEW OF THE WATER QUALITY. OVERALL THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR HAS BETTER DRINKING WATER QUALITY THAN THE GREAT LAKES WATER AUTHORITY. A REVIEW OF THE CITY AND GREAT LAKES WATER AUTHORITY DRINKING WATER QUALITY SHOWS THAT THE GREAT LAKES WATER AUTHORITY DRINKING WATER CONTAINS ABOUT 9 TIMES MORE CANCER-CAUSING CHEMICALS AND NINE-TIMES MORE LEAD AS THE CITY DRINKING WATER, BASED ON THE DATA CONTAINED IN THE CITY AND THE GREAT LAKES WATER AUTHORITY 2020 WATER QUALITY REPORTS. THE GREAT LAKES WATER AUTHORITY INTAKE FOR DRINKING WATER, THAT WOULD BE PROVIDED TO THE CITY, COMES FROM THE DETROIT RIVER AND NOT LAKE HURON. THE STATE OF MICHIGAN HAS DERDETERMINED THAT THE GREAT LAS WATER INTAKES ARE HIGHLY SUSCEPTIBLE, ACCORDING TO THE GREAT LAKES WATER AUTHORITY, 2020 WATER QUALITY REPORT. THERE HAVE BEEN DOCUMENTED CONTAMINATION OF THE GREAT LAKES WATER AUTHORITY DRINKING WATER BY VOLATILE OR CANTIC CHEMICALS INCLUDING DIOXANE. THERE'S PFAS AND OTHER CONTAMINANTS AND TO THE 19 PFAS WAS FOUND IN THE DETROIT RIVER INTAKES FEEDING THE GREAT LAKES WATER AUTHORITY. THERE ARE POTENTIAL ADVERSE IMPACTS TO THE GREAT LAKES WATER AUTHORITY DRINKING WATER INTAKES FROM SARNIA CANADA, CHEMICAL INDUSTRY SPILLS. IN SUMMARY, THE RISK TO THE SOURCE WATER QUALITY IS LOWER WITH REHABILITATING THE CITY WATER TREATMENT PLANT THAN GOING TO THE GREAT LAKES WATER AUTHORITY DETROIT RIVER SOURCE. THE CITY WATER TREATMENT PLANT INCLUDES AN ACTIVATED CARBON SYSTEM THAT REMOVES PFAS AND MANY OTHER TYPES OF ORGANIC CHEMICALS WHEREAS THE GREAT LAKES WATER AUTHORITY WATER TREATMENT PLANTS DO NOT CONTAIN THIS ACTIVATED CARBON TECHNOLOGY. THE CITY WATER TREATMENT PLANT IS UP WITH OF THE MOST ADVANCED WATER TREATMENT PLANTS IN THE STATE OF MICHIGAN. THANK YOU.
01:03:09.481: >> THANK YOU.
01:03:17.022: >> Clerk Beaudry: MAYOR, I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER CALLERS ON THE LINE WITH THEIR HANDS UP.
01:03:26.531: >> Mayor Taylor: SEEING TO ONE FURTHER, PUBLIC COMMENT IS CLOSED. ARE THERE COMMUNICATIONS FROM COUNCIL? OH, WE HAVE GOT -- 202.
01:03:39.611: >> Clerk Beaudry: CALLER WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING IN 202, DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT? PRESS STAR SIX.
01:03:46.651: >> THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING. I LIVE AT 556 GLENDALE CIRCLE IN ANN ARBOR. I HAVE APPROXIMATELY 40 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE AS A TOXICOLOGIST, RECENTLY RETIRED AS A PROFESSOR OF TOXICOLOGY FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN. I STRONGLY ADVOCATE OPERATING THE CURRENT WATER TREATMENT FACILITY. IT PRODUCES HIGH QUALITY AFFORDABLE, SAFE DRINKING WATER. IT OPERATESIN A REASONABLE MANNER. IT IS RESPONSIBLE TO LOCAL CONCERNS. THE SAME IS NOT ALL CERTAIN FOR THE GREAT LAKES WATER AUTHORITY. I WILL ADDRESS TWO MAJOR WATER CONTAMINATION CONCERNS I HAVE WITH THE GREAT LAKES WATER AUTHORITY. FIRST CHLORINATION DISINFECTAN. THESE WILL BE HIGHER IN THE GREAT LAKES WATER AUTHORITY. THE FARTHER THE FINISH WATER HAS TO TRAVEL AFTER LEAVING THE WATER TREATMENT PLANT, THE HIGHER THE CONCENTRATION OF CHLORINE OR CHLOROMEAN IS NEEDED. THIS INFECTION -- IT REACTS WITH PLANT DEBRIS. AND 750 WATER TREATMENT BYPRODUCTS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED BUT ONLY ABOUT 80 OF THOSE HAVE BEEN EVALUATED FOR TOXICITY. SEVERAL HAVE DEVELOPMENTAL TOXICITY. BOTTOM LINE, ANN ARBOR WILL BE AT THE END OF THE LINE WITH THE LONGEST TRAVEL TIME IN PIPES REQUIRING MORE CHLORINATION AND THE MOST OPPORTUNITY FOR FORMATION OF HARMFUL DISINFECTION BYPRODUCTS. AND MY SECOND CONCERN IS THE DETROIT RIVER. THIS IS NOT A REFERRED SOURCE OF DRINKING WATER. THE DETROIT RIVER WOULD BE A SOURCE OF THE WATER BY THE GREAT LAKES WATER AUTHORITY. ONE WATER INTAKE IS A MERE TWO OR SO MILES DOWNSTREAM OF ZUGG ISLAND, A HEAVILY POLLUTED TOXIC SITE. HOME TO THE HUGE, 250-ACRE MARATHON REFINERY, GREAT LAKES WATER AUTHORITY WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT AND DOZENS OF INDUSTRIAL PROCESSING PLANTS. THE OTHER WATER INTAKE IS WHERE LAKE ST. CLAIR DRAINS INTO THE DETROIT RIVER. THIS INTAKE IS DOWNSTREAM FROM SARNIA'S HEAVILY INDUSTRIALIZED AND POLLUTED CHEMICAL ALONG THE ST. CLAIR RIVER IN CANADA. THE ST. CLAIR FLOWS FROM LAKE HURON TO LAKE ST. CLAIR AT SUCH AFTER STRONG FLOW RATE THAT A CHEMICAL SPILL IN SASH ANYIA WILL REACH.
01:06:26.878: >> Clerk Beaudry: 30 SECONDS.
01:06:29.114: >> BOTTOM LINE, THE DETROIT RIVER WITH WATER INTAKES DOWNSTREAM FROM HIGHLY INDUSTRIALIZED POLLUTED SITES IS A MORE HIGHLY CONTAMINATED SOURCE OF DRINKING WATER FOR ANN ARBOR COMPARED TO THE HURON RIVER. IF WE MOVE TO THE GREAT LAKES WATER AUTHORITY, WE TRADE LOCAL CONTROL OF HIGH QUALITY WATER TESTING TREATMENT WITH WATERS OF HIGHER LEVEL OF CONTAMINANTS. THANK YOU.
01:07:01.813: >> Mayor Taylor: THANK YOU. SEEING TO ONE FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT IS CLOSED. ARE THERE COMMUNICATIONS FROM COUNCIL? COUNCILMEMBER GRISWOLD.
01:07:15.026: >> Councilmember Griswold:  I JUST WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO TOOK THE TIME TO SPEAK THIS EVENING. ALTHOUGH THE HIGH POINT OF THE ENING WAS ACTUALLY A PEAK AT THE BABY. SO THANK YOU.
01:07:33.278: >> Mayor Taylor: FURTHER COMMUNICATION FROM COUNCIL. MAY I HAVE A MOTION TO ADJOURN, PLEASE? MOVED BY GRISWOLD AND SECONDED BY NELSON. DISCUSSION? ALL IN FAVOR? OPPOSED? WE ARE ADJOURNED. THANK YOU UP AND DOWN.
